sir
roger

coverley
preface
by
the
general
editor
this
series
of
books
aims
first
to
give
the
english
texts
required
for
entrance
to
college
in
a
form
which
shall
make
them
clear
interesting
and
helpful
to
those
who
are
beginning
the
study
of
literature
and
second
to
supply
the
knowledge
which
the
student
needs
to
pass
the
entrance
examination
for
these
two
reasons
it
is
called
gateway
the
poems
plays
essays
and
stories
in
these
small
volumes
are
treated
first
of
all
as
works
of
literature
which
were
written
to
be
read
and
enjoyed
not
to
be
parsed
and
scanned
and
pulled
to
pieces
a
short
life
of
the
author
is
given
and
a
portrait
in
order
to
help
the
student
to
know
the
real
person
who
wrote
the
book
the
introduction
tells
what
it
is
about
and
how
it
was
written
and
where
the
author
got
the
idea
and
what
it
means
the
notes
at
the
foot
of
the
page
are
simply
to
give
the
sense
of
the
hard
words
so
that
the
student
can
read
straight
on
without
turning
to
a
dictionary
the
other
notes
at
the
end
of
the
book
explain
difficulties
and
allusions
and
fine
points
the
editors
are
chosen
because
of
their
thorough
training
and
special
fitness
to
deal
with
the
books
committed
to
them
and
because
they
agree
with
this
idea
of
what
a
gateway
series
ought
to
be
they
express
in
each
case
their
own
views
of
the
books
which
they
edit
simplicity
thoroughness
shortness
and
clearness
these
we
hope
will
be
the
marks
of
the
series
henry
van
dyke
preface
the
text
of
the
papers
in
this
volume
is
that
of
gregory
smith
edition
of
this
edition
has
been
chosen
because
it
reproduces
the
original
form
of
the
papers
after
they
had
been
corrected
by
steele
and
addison
for
the
first
collected
edition
of
and
before
they
had
been
tampered
with
by
later
editors
in
three
or
four
instances
a
few
words
have
been
omitted
the
omission
in
every
case
being
indicated
and
spelling
punctuation
and
capitalization
have
been
modernized
as
they
must
be
for
a
school
text
in
other
particulars
it
is
believed
the
papers
stand
in
this
volume
as
they
were
left
by
their
authors
all
the
papers
are
included
except
that
one
by
tickell
of
which
addison
himself
disapproved
i
have
thought
it
best
however
to
print
only
entire
papers
and
have
not
therefore
culled
the
few
paragraphs
in
which
incidental
mention
is
made
of
sir
roger
in
the
course
of
essays
devoted
chiefly
to
other
subjects
in
accordance
with
the
plan
of
this
series
the
occasional
brief
notes
needed
to
explain
a
word
or
to
call
attention
to
some
peculiar
idiom
or
structure
are
set
at
the
foot
of
the
page
longer
illustrative
notes
follow
the
text
at
the
end
of
the
volume
the
best
method
of
approach
to
the
work
of
any
author
is
usually
through
a
study
of
his
life
and
surroundings
this
is
certainly
true
of
a
literature
so
full
of
personal
interest
as
the
literature
of
the
age
of
queen
anne
i
have
therefore
in
the
introduction
attempted
to
give
some
notion
of
the
personality
of
steele
and
addison
and
then
some
account
of
the
social
conditions
that
explain
the
remarkable
success
of
and
two
or
three
books
like
thackeray
humourists
of
the
eighteenth
and
life
in
the
reign
of
queen
will
help
the
student
in
his
endeavour
to
frame
in
his
imagination
a
picture
of
the
men
and
their
time
but
for
comment
on
nothing
after
all
is
worth
so
much
as
itself
the
student
should
be
encouraged
to
read
more
of
these
charming
papers
and
to
make
himself
if
possible
a
little
at
home
in
that
most
urbane
and
hospitable
period

english
literature

notes
introduction
steele
and
addison
on
the
morning
of
the
of
april
there
was
laid
upon
all
the
tables
of
london
the
first
number
of
a
sheet
in
small
folio
entitled
tatler
or
the
lucubrations
of
isaac
was
to
be
issued
thrice
a
week
on
tuesdays
thursdays
and
saturdays
and
could
be
bought
for
the
moderate
price
of
one
penny
the
pseudonym
isaac
bickerstaff
had
been
made
familiar
all
over
london
some
months
before
by
an
admirable
jest
played
by
dr
swift
upon
a
notorious
almanac
maker
and
quack
astrologer
one
partridge
swift
writing
over
the
signature
of
bickerstaff
had
gravely
predicted
that
partridge
would
infallibly
die
at
a
certain
day
and
hour
and
in
another
pamphlet
had
given
a
circumstantial
account
of
his
decease
while
poor
partridge
convulsed
the
town
with
frantic
protestations
that
he
was
still
alive
but
the
editor
of
who
now
assumed
this
name
of
bickerstaff
was
not
swift
but
richard
steele
it
seems
to
have
been
steele
intention
to
keep
for
a
time
his
editorship
a
secret
but
his
disguise
was
soon
penetrated
by
at
least
one
of
his
friends
joseph
addison
who
was
in
ireland
when
appeared
detected
the
hand
of
his
friend
in
the
sixth
number
he
furnished
steele
it
is
said
with
many
hints
and
suggestions
for
the
early
numbers
of
the
paper
and
after
his
return
from
ireland
in
became
himself
a
regular
contributor
in
january
came
suddenly
to
an
end
with
the
number
steele
however
had
no
thought
of
abandoning
this
form
of
literary
effort
and
on
the
first
of
the
following
march
he
started
that
now
more
famous
journal
was
similar
in
form
and
purpose
to
but
it
was
to
be
issued
daily
it
is
usually
spoken
of
as
addison
but
it
was
no
more
addison
than
steele
the
two
men
were
associated
in
the
conduct
of
it
from
the
start
and
their
contributions
were
about
equal
in
number
addison
writing
papers
and
steele
the
second
number
of
written
by
steele
contains
the
account
of
that
club
of
which
sir
roger
de
coverley
was
the
most
famous
member
and
the
coverley
papers
followed
at
intervals
through
the
next
year
and
a
half
the
friendship
of
steele
and
addison
was
not
of
recent
growth
they
had
been
boys
together
in
the
charterhouse
school
london
dick
steele
at
that
time
was
a
fatherless
and
almost
friendless
lad
who
had
been
recommended
to
the
charterhouse
by
a
distant
relative
the
duke
of
ormond
addison
was
the
son
of
the
dean
of
lichfield
and
came
up
to
the
charterhouse
from
a
home
of
culture
and
learning
the
two
young
fellows
formed
here
one
of
those
school
friendships
that
last
a
lifetime
addison
though
a
little
the
younger
was
doubtless
a
good
deal
the
wiser
of
the
two
and
there
may
have
been
in
his
regard
a
touch
of
that
patronizing
temper
which
in
later
life
he
sometimes
showed
in
too
superior
a
fashion
but
for
steele
the
acquaintance
was
certainly
very
fortunate
there
are
pleasant
glimpses
of
the
young
irish
lad
invited
for
a
holiday
to
the
home
of
his
friend
addison
the
quiet
deanery
under
the
trees
at
lichfield
good
dean
addison
steele
said
many
years
after
loved
him
as
one
of
his
own
sons
and
in
that
home
the
fatherless
boy
saw
how
domestic
love
and
purity
lend
a
charm
to
manners
that
all
the
wit
and
fashion
of
the
town
can
never
give
in
one
of
the
most
delightful
of
the
papers
he
gives
a
portrait
of
a
father
dignified
and
decorous
yet
affectionate
which
is
evidently
drawn
from
his
recollections
of
the
lichfield
household
read
the
touching
account
of
his
father
death
no
no
addison
was
entered
at
queen
college
oxford
in
at
the
early
age
of
fifteen
and
next
year
obtained
a
scholarship
at
magdalen
where
he
continued
in
residence
as
undergraduate
master
and
fellow
until
steele
whose
scholarship
was
probably
not
brilliant
though
he
had
been
in
the
charterhouse
two
years
longer
than
addison
did
not
follow
him
to
oxford
until
when
he
was
matriculated
at
christ
church
he
did
not
remain
there
however
long
enough
to
take
any
degree
he
never
had
the
retiring
and
scholarly
tastes
of
his
friend
addison
and
after
three
years
in
the
university
could
resist
the
attractions
of
the
great
outside
world
no
longer
looking
about
for
a
career
he
not
unnaturally
decided
for
the
army
and
in
he
left
oxford
to
enlist
as
a
private
in
the
horse
guards
he
soon
received
a
commission
as
ensign
in
the
regiment
of
lord
cutts
and
before
is
mentioned
as
captain
steele
steele
soldiering
which
was
nearly
all
done
in
london
and
served
chiefly
to
make
him
acquainted
with
the
town
might
be
passed
over
were
it
not
for
one
thing
that
came
of
it
his
life
in
the
guards
was
doubtless
not
so
irregular
as
that
of
most
soldiers
but
it
was
more
irregular
than
his
conscience
could
approve
in
the
sincerity
of
his
heart
the
young
captain
of
the
guards
bethought
himself
of
strengthening
his
moral
and
religious
principles
by
writing
them
down
in
black
and
white
judging
as
he
said
that
he
might
thereby
be
led
to
think
about
them
the
more
and
by
his
desire
of
consistency
make
his
life
conform
to
them
the
better
the
result
was
the
first
if
we
except
some
verses
printed
at
the
death
of
queen
mary
in
of
ventures
in
authorship
christian
hero
an
argument
to
prove
that
no
principles
save
those
of
religion
are
sufficient
to
make
a
great
christian
is
by
no
means
a
piece
of
priggery
but
a
sensible
and
wise
little
book
it
shows
moreover
on
almost
every
page
some
flavour
of
steele
engaging
ingenuousness
and
humour
it
is
of
historic
interest
too
as
introducing
a
new
style
of
writing
for
it
may
be
called
the
first
attempt
to
enlist
the
charm
of
wit
and
good
breeding
in
the
service
of
religion
it
contains
the
germs
of
scores
of
essays
steele
afterward
wrote
with
that
intent
christian
did
not
correct
all
of
steele
irregularities
but
it
did
reveal
to
him
where
his
best
ability
lay
he
said
complacently
later
in
life
that
when
he
put
on
his
and
mounted
his
horse
as
a
dragoon
he
was
acquainted
with
his
own
parts
and
did
know
that
he
could
handle
a
pen
better
than
a
sword
christian
taught
him
that
as
soon
as
the
book
was
through
the
press
he
tried
his
hand
at
a
comedy
finding
it
necessary
as
he
said
to
enliven
his
character
he
might
seem
to
have
been
careful
however
not
to
overdo
this
enlivening
of
his
character
for
his
comedy
was
entitled
funeral
or
grief
√†
la
but
in
spite
of
its
lugubrious
title
it
contained
some
genuinely
humorous
scenes
and
by
grace
of
very
good
acting
and
the
applause
of
steele
fellow
soldiers
of
the
guards
who
packed
the
house
it
scored
a
satisfactory
stage
success
two
other
comedies
followed
this
in
the
next
three
years
lying
in
and
tender
in
by
this
time
steele
reputation
as
a
wit
was
assured
always
what
doctor
johnson
used
to
call
a
clubbable
man
his
easy
gayety
and
rather
too
convivial
habits
made
him
a
typical
man
about
town
and
captain
steele
began
to
be
spoken
of
as
a
man
who
talked
charmingly
and
who
could
write
as
well
as
he
talked
in
he
married
a
widow
one
mrs
stretch
who
died
a
year
and
a
half
later
and
left
him
a
snug
estate
in
the
barbadoes
thus
secured
against
the
chance
of
adverse
fortune
he
sold
his
commission
in
the
army
and
set
up
as
man
of
letters
like
all
the
writers
of
his
time
however
he
considered
his
pen
to
be
at
the
service
of
his
political
party
and
expected
a
reward
in
some
civil
office
in
he
was
appointed
gentleman
usher
to
prince
george
of
denmark
the
stupid
husband
of
queen
anne
and
in
the
following
year
was
given
the
more
lucrative
position
of
gazetteer
this
office
he
held
when
in
he
started
about
a
year
after
the
death
of
his
first
wife
steele
had
married
again
this
time
a
welsh
beauty
miss
mary
scurlock
the
letters
of
steele
to
this
lady
during
the
few
weeks
of
acquaintance
that
preceded
the
marriage
and
for
years
thereafter
are
the
most
delightful
domestic
correspondence
in
our
language
they
are
most
of
them
mere
notelets
written
in
his
office
at
the
club
in
a
tavern
anywhere
whence
he
may
send
her
a
kind
word
steele
never
had
any
mastery
of
business
and
it
is
probable
that
the
bailiffs
had
something
to
do
with
the
frequent
absences
from
home
that
these
letters
record
steele
on
the
other
hand
was
a
woman
of
unusually
thrifty
and
methodical
habit
to
whom
the
carelessness
and
extravagance
of
her
husband
must
have
been
very
trying
it
is
evident
from
his
letters
that
she
sometimes
gave
him
quite
as
much
advice
as
he
felt
himself
able
to
use
after
the
first
few
months
he
has
dropped
the
molly
and
the
letters
are
uniformly
addressed
to
his
dear
prue
and
once
or
twice
he
goes
so
far
as
to
remonstrate
with
her
quietly
for
an
unendurable
interference
with
his
business
yet
nothing
disturbs
his
constant
affection
and
the
letters
are
filled
with
the
same
playful
tender
prettinesses
to
the
last
that
was
a
truthful
signature
with
which
he
once
signed
a
midnight
letter
when
he
could
not
come
home
i
am
my
dear
prue
a
little
in
drink
but
at
all
times
your
own
faithful
husband
richard
steele
there
was
no
other
man
of
letters
in
the
queen
anne
time
i
am
sure
whose
domestic
life
would
bear
turning
wrong
side
out
so
well
indeed
no
other
writer
of
that
age
appreciated
so
well
the
character
of
woman
or
has
given
us
such
pictures
of
the
beauty
and
charm
of
home
it
was
steele
who
paid
to
lady
elizabeth
hastings
that
best
compliment
ever
offered
to
a
lady
to
love
her
is
a
liberal
education
it
was
in
these
happy
early
years
of
his
married
life
when
his
fortunes
though
always
precarious
were
hopeful
when
he
was
enjoying
the
friendship
of
halifax
and
addison
and
swift
when
his
own
humor
and
invention
were
at
their
brightest
that
steele
had
the
one
great
inspiration
of
his
life
he
conceived
the
idea
of
meantime
addison
had
begun
his
career
both
in
politics
and
in
letters
he
had
not
been
in
haste
addison
was
never
in
haste
in
some
three
years
after
his
friend
steele
left
oxford
he
had
been
elected
fellow
of
magdalen
college
and
seemed
well
satisfied
with
the
retired
and
scholarly
life
there
he
had
some
modest
literary
aspirations
in
he
published
some
verses
entitled
account
of
the
english
which
make
it
evident
that
he
had
no
relish
for
chaucer
and
spenser
and
which
do
not
mention
shakespeare
at
all
in
latin
poetry
his
taste
was
happier
he
made
a
translation
of
the
georgics
of
virgil
prefaced
by
an
essay
that
won
compliments
from
the
great
dryden
and
he
wrote
latin
verses
of
his
own
that
were
thought
to
be
of
quite
surprising
excellence
his
classical
studies
may
not
have
broadened
his
taste
or
his
intellect
very
much
but
they
doubtless
did
something
to
cultivate
that
smoothness
and
nicety
of
phrase
for
which
he
was
afterward
to
be
so
noted
in
those
years
at
magdalen
everybody
supposed
he
would
go
into
the
church
he
seemed
a
parson
born
and
bred
and
he
doubtless
would
have
taken
orders
had
it
not
been
for
a
piece
of
signal
good
fortune
that
befell
him
dryden
had
introduced
young
addison
to
congreve
and
congreve
had
introduced
him
to
montague
afterward
lord
halifax
montague
it
was
worth
while
to
know
really
a
great
statesman
and
financier
he
had
won
some
reputation
as
a
poet
in
his
earlier
days
and
was
always
ambitious
to
be
accounted
the
friend
and
patron
of
letters
in
those
years
the
leaders
of
both
political
parties
were
coming
to
see
the
need
of
enlisting
the
services
of
young
men
of
wit
and
learning
and
montague
whose
appreciation
perhaps
was
quickened
by
some
complimentary
verses
in
excellent
latin
deemed
this
addison
too
promising
an
ally
to
lose
accordingly
in
when
he
was
addison
was
given
a
handsome
pension
of
three
hundred
pounds
a
year
bidden
go
travel
on
the
continent
keep
his
eyes
open
and
learn
french
he
remained
on
the
continent
about
three
years
when
at
the
death
of
king
william
his
pension
lapsed
and
at
the
breaking
out
of
the
great
war
of
the
spanish
succession
he
was
obliged
to
return
to
england
his
prospects
for
the
next
three
years
were
not
bright
he
had
written
some
good
latin
verses
and
some
english
verses
that
were
not
so
good
on
his
return
from
his
travels
he
printed
a
rather
dull
account
of
them
which
few
people
read
then
and
which
nobody
reads
now
he
was
known
to
a
little
circle
of
great
men
but
he
was
dangerously
near
poverty
yet
good
fortune
never
deserted
addison
for
long
in
the
duke
of
marlborough
won
the
famous
victory
of
blenheim
and
forthwith
the
little
whig
poets
began
to
sing
it
but
much
of
their
fustian
was
so
sublimely
bad
that
even
the
lord
treasurer
godolphin
to
whom
all
poetry
was
very
much
alike
began
to
see
that
the
triumph
was
suffering
for
lack
of
a
worthy
poet
in
this
emergency
he
applied
to
montague
whom
he
supposed
to
know
most
about
such
matters
and
montague
recommended
his
old
prot√©g√©
addison
thus
it
happened
if
pope
story
be
correct
that
one
day
there
climbed
to
lodgings
up
three
flights
in
the
haymarket
no
less
a
person
than
the
honorable
henry
boyle
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
with
the
request
that
addison
write
a
poem
which
addison
produced
in
response
to
this
august
invitation
will
be
voted
by
most
readers
a
dull
poem
but
it
was
much
admired
then
and
one
simile
in
particular
comparing
marlborough
to
an
avenging
angel
is
said
to
have
captivated
the
imagination
of
godolphin
at
all
events
served
to
introduce
addison
to
public
life
he
was
shortly
after
made
of
state
and
was
never
out
of
office
again
so
long
as
he
lived
in
he
was
elected
to
parliament
next
year
was
appointed
of
state
for
ireland
where
he
was
residing
when
steele
started
and
although
he
lost
that
office
when
the
whigs
went
into
a
minority
in
yet
he
was
one
of
the
few
whigs
elected
to
parliament
that
year
after
the
death
of
anne
he
went
to
ireland
again
as
chief
secretary
and
for
a
little
time
before
his
death
reached
his
highest
office
as
secretary
of
state
for
england
it
was
a
career
of
easy
and
uninterrupted
prosperity
i
believe
addison
could
be
elected
king
if
he
chose
said
swift
with
a
twinge
of
envy
yet
addison
would
never
have
been
remembered
for
his
public
services
his
title
to
lasting
fame
like
that
of
steele
rests
upon
the
work
done
for
and
the
later
writings
of
the
two
men
are
of
less
importance
was
discontinued
at
the
end
of
and
through
the
following
year
steele
conducted
a
similar
periodical
from
which
political
discussion
was
not
to
be
so
rigidly
excluded
as
it
had
been
from
in
the
next
five
years
he
attempted
three
or
four
other
papers
but
they
were
all
and
of
little
interest
addison
revived
in
issuing
it
thrice
a
week
for
a
year
and
in
he
conducted
for
some
months
a
periodical
called
in
the
interest
of
party
measures
he
was
then
advocating
but
neither
steele
nor
addison
ever
had
much
success
in
managing
an
enterprise
of
this
sort
alone
in
addison
produced
his
once
famous
play
of
the
reader
of
will
vote
the
cold
and
declamatory
but
it
was
vastly
admired
then
as
the
first
correct
and
dignified
tragedy
upon
the
english
stage
the
critics
and
the
crowd
united
to
praise
and
all
the
town
went
to
see
it
by
this
time
addison
was
regarded
as
the
foremost
man
of
letters
in
england
he
set
up
a
servant
of
his
one
buttons
as
proprietor
of
a
in
great
russell
street
almost
opposite
will
where
dryden
had
reigned
as
critic
twenty
years
before
and
here
he
presided
over
his
circle
of
friends
and
admirers
and
gave
his
little
senate
laws
perhaps
in
his
later
years
his
happiest
hours
were
passed
here
in
he
had
married
the
countess
dowager
of
warwick
to
whom
he
had
long
paid
patient
and
dignified
court
but
if
rumour
is
to
be
trusted
his
domestic
life
was
not
a
happy
one
marrying
discord
in
a
noble
wife
was
pope
last
thrust
at
him
he
did
not
long
survive
his
fortune
good
or
ill
but
died
at
holland
house
the
residence
of
his
countess
june
at
the
early
age
of
steele
survived
his
friend
more
than
ten
years
but
they
were
years
of
inactivity
the
great
blow
of
his
life
fell
when
his
wife
died
in
that
year
was
also
further
embittered
by
an
unfortunate
controversy
with
addison
which
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
estranged
the
two
friends
after
steele
retired
from
london
and
passed
his
remaining
years
partly
in
hereford
and
partly
in
the
welsh
town
of
carmarthen
he
had
succeeded
in
paying
all
his
debts
he
kept
the
love
and
esteem
of
all
his
old
friends
that
were
left
and
his
temper
was
sweet
and
gentle
to
the
last

died

in
september
ii
the
tatler
and
the
spectator
the
date
of
the
founding
of
is
important
as
marking
the
beginning
of
popular
literature
in
england
from
this
humble
origin
sprang
the
great
army
of
magazines
and
reviews
which
for
the
last
two
hundred
years
have
contained
so
much
of
the
best
english
writing
before
it
may
be
said
that
there
was
no
good
reading
in
popular
form
the
english
novel
was
not
yet
born
the
newspapers
about
as
large
as
a
lady
pocket
handkerchief
contained
nothing
but
news
and
very
little
of
that
the
political
pamphlet
was
purely
partisan
was
usually
written
by
and
could
rarely
pretend
to
any
permanent
interest
or
literary
quality
in
daniel
defoe
had
founded
his
which
deserves
to
be
called
the
earliest
of
political
journals
but
the
though
it
contains
much
vigorous
writing
was
strictly
a
party
organ
steele
purpose
in
was
quite
different
he
is
a
humorist
and
moralist
he
writes
to
entertain
and
incidentally
to
correct
or
improve
he
aims
to
depict
all
the
charms
and
the
humours
of
society
and
to
turn
a
playful
satire
upon
its
follies
to
do
this
is
always
to
make
literature
to
do
it
as
steele
and
addison
could
is
to
show
the
very
age
and
body
of
the
time
his
form
and
pressure
the
immediate
success
of
and
is
easily
understood
in
the
first
place
there
was
now
coming
to
be
for
the
first
time
a
large
reading
public
in
england
before
no
english
author
had
made
a
fortune
or
even
a
competence
by
the
sale
of
his
books
but
the
most
important
social
fact
in
england
at
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
is
the
rapid
growth
of
a
great
middle
class
shrewd
energetic
these
men
were
getting
the
trade
and
commerce
of
england
mostly
into
their
hands
filling
up
the
great
towns
and
exerting
an
influence
in
public
affairs
which
neither
political
party
could
afford
to
overlook
it
was
for
them
that
the
political
pamphlet
was
written
how
large
a
reading
public
a
popular
pamphleteer
might
command
at
this
time
may
be
inferred
from
the
fact
that
sixty
thousand
copies
of
one
of
defoe
pamphlets
are
said
to
have
been
sold
on
the
streets
of
london
and
swift
famous
tract
conduct
of
the
ran
through
four
editions
in
a
week
but
these
people
demanded
something
better
than
the
party
pamphlet
intelligent
ambitious
they
had
social
aspirations
and
were
interested
in
the
life
of
the
hour
in
the
club
in
the
at
the
theatre
they
had
some
relish
too
of
the
best
things
in
poetry
and
art
when
pope
translated
the
his
publisher
issued
an
elegant
subscription
edition
of
six
hundred
and
fifty
copies
for
more
aristocratic
purchasers
but
he
issued
also
a
cheap
duodecimo
edition
for
the
general
public
and
of
this
he
seems
to
have
sold
about
seven
thousand
copies
almost
immediately
after
publication
indeed
if
we
except
addison
all
the
prominent
men
of
letters
of
the
queen
anne
time
steele
swift
pope
prior
gay
themselves
belonged
to
this
middle
class
they
were
all
the
sons
of
tradesmen
the
readers
for
whom
steele
and
addison
wrote
nearly
all
lived
in
london
and
loved
it
they
were
interested
in
the
passing
life
of
the
town
in
the
street
the
stage
the
doubtless
that
old
london
was
an
ugly
unkempt
town
its
population
was
only
about
half
a
million
less
than
what
it
is
its
streets
were
narrow
and
dirty
separated
from
the
strip
of
sidewalk
on
either
hand
by
reeking
gutters
after
nightfall
lighted
only
by
flickering
oil
lamps
they
were
the
haunt
of
footpads
who
terrorized
the
watchmen
and
of
bands
of
roistering
young
blades
who
headed
up
women
in
barrels
and
rolled
them
down
hill
for
diversion
or
chased
the
unwary
stranger
into
a
corner
and
made
him
dance
by
pricking
him
with
their
sword
points
public
morals
were
very
low
drunkenness
and
license
confronted
the
decent
citizen
on
every
hand
and
in
public
gardens
like
vauxhall
often
held
high
carnival
taste
and
manners
even
in
what
called
itself
polite
society
were
often
coarse
profanity
loud
and
open
might
have
been
heard
on
the
lips
of
fine
ladies
in
places
of
public
resort
while
swift
affords
convincing
proof
of
how
vapid
and
how
gross
the
talk
might
be
at
the
ridotto
or
over
the
card
table
yet
if
society
at
this
time
had
its
seamy
side
it
was
in
the
age
of
anne
that
englishmen
began
to
feel
the
charm
of
wit
and
manners
of
fashion
and
breeding
to
the
man
about
town
this
murky
london
was
the
centre
of
all
that
was
best
and
brightest
in
a
new
society
it
was
not
so
large
but
that
he
felt
at
home
in
every
part
of
it
in
one
he
met
the
wits
and
men
of
letters
in
another
the
scholars
and
clergy
in
another
the
merchants
in
another
the
men
of
fashion
and
gallantry
and
in
all
he
could
hear
bright
talk
upon
the
news
of
the
day
in
the
theatre
he
could
see
the
latest
play
written
by
congreve
or
addison
and
with
a
prologue
by
pope
he
probably
belonged
to
two
or
three
clubs
and
in
the
or
at
the
assembly
he
enjoyed
the
society
of
women
with
the
charm
of
gentle
manners
and
brilliant
conversation
all
that
served
to
make
life
attractive
and
character
urbane
he
found
between
hyde
park
and
the
bank
now
it
was
to
this
quickened
social
sense
that
and
made
appeal
they
pictured
the
life
of
the
town
from
day
to
day
especially
in
its
lighter
more
humorous
phases
and
this
was
always
done
with
some
underlying
moral
purpose
as
the
months
go
past
we
have
in
these
papers
an
exhaustless
flow
of
kindly
satire
upon
the
manners
and
minor
morals
of
society
on
behaviour
at
church
on
ogling
the
ladies
on
on
the
folly
of
enormous
petticoats
and
low
tuckers
on
the
brainless
fops
that
display
themselves
in
club
windows
and
the
brainless
flirts
that
display
themselves
in
stage
boxes
we
have
bits
of
keen
too
the
small
poet
who
assures
you
that
poets
are
born
not
made
the
beau
who
is
caught
practising
before
the
mirror
to
catch
a
careless
air
the
man
who
is
so
ambitious
to
be
thought
wise
that
he
sets
up
for
a
and
talks
atheism
all
day
at
the
club
though
he
says
his
prayers
very
carefully
every
night
at
home
one
can
imagine
with
what
pleasure
the
town
must
have
seen
its
follies
taken
off
so
smartly
occasionally
too
there
are
short
stories
usually
written
by
steele
bits
of
domestic
narrative
showing
the
peace
and
purity
of
home
in
the
papers
are
somewhat
longer
and
more
ambitious
than
those
of
and
here
are
many
essays
on
graver
themes
and
carefully
elaborated
critical
studies
like
the
famous
series
by
addison
on
milton
yet
from
first
to
last
the
most
interesting
papers
both
of
and
are
those
which
depict
with
kindly
irony
the
daily
life
of
the
town
there
is
not
to
be
found
in
english
literature
up
to
that
time
any
satire
so
wholesome
any
pictures
of
contemporary
society
so
vivid
and
so
entertaining
indeed
it
may
perhaps
be
said
that
of
the
sort
we
have
had
nothing
better
in
english
literature
since
for
such
writing
as
this
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
two
men
better
fitted
than
richard
steele
and
joseph
addison
each
supplied
the
deficiencies
of
the
other
steele
was
an
impulsive
man
of
the
world
few
men
knew
the
society
of
that
day
in
all
its
phases
better
than
he
did
and
certainly
no
man
liked
it
better
no
english
writer
before
him
feels
so
keenly
the
charm
of
the
passing
hour
or
takes
such
brisk
and
cheery
interest
in
all
the
thousand
events
of
daily
experience
his
sympathies
too
were
warm
as
well
as
broad
his
heart
was
tender
and
he
always
carried
it
on
his
sleeve
this
amiable
and
ingenuous
temper
made
his
writing
very
attractive
and
still
goes
far
to
atone
for
all
its
imperfections
addison
on
the
other
hand
was
a
rather
cool
observant
man
who
loved
to
sit
in
his
club
with
a
little
circle
of
admirers
about
him
and
promote
the
of
the
world
in
a
somewhat
superior
and
distant
fashion
his
temper
less
buoyant
than
steele
was
more
thoughtful
and
reflective
his
humour
more
delicate
and
subtle
and
if
his
observation
was
not
so
broad
as
that
of
steele
it
was
nicer
and
more
penetrating
steele
seeing
life
at
more
points
struck
out
more
new
incidents
and
characters
addison
had
more
skill
to
elaborate
them
in
point
of
style
the
work
of
addison
is
manifestly
superior
to
that
of
steele
steele
writing
has
indeed
the
great
merit
of
spontaneity
it
is
full
of
himself
to
read
his
easy
lively
page
is
like
hearing
him
talk
at
your
elbow
and
now
and
then
when
his
emotions
are
warmed
he
can
snatch
a
grace
beyond
the
reach
of
art
but
he
was
too
impulsive
and
eager
to
stay
for
that
painstaking
correction
without
which
literary
finish
is
impossible
his
rhetoric
and
even
his
grammar
are
sometimes
sadly
to
seek
the
faults
of
his
extempore
writing
were
matter
of
caustic
comment
by
the
critics
of
his
own
day
and
ever
since
it
has
been
customary
to
award
the
literary
honours
of
and
not
to
steele
but
to
addison
nor
is
this
unjust
for
addison
was
the
first
of
our
writers
to
perceive
clearly
that
simple
and
popular
prose
was
capable
of
finished
artistic
treatment
that
minute
care
that
trained
skill
which
hitherto
had
been
reserved
for
poetry
he
bestowed
upon
his
prose
he
had
naturally
a
nice
taste
an
especially
quick
sense
of
movement
and
melody
in
prose
and
he
took
infinite
pains
he
would
stop
the
press
to
change
a
phrase
or
set
right
a
conjunction
and
this
effort
issued
in
a
style
in
which
all
sense
of
effort
is
lost
in
graceful
ease
his
thought
is
never
profound
and
seldom
vigorous
his
range
is
not
wide
on
serious
subjects
he
is
sometimes
a
little
dull
and
on
lighter
subjects
sometimes
a
little
trivial
but
his
manner
is
always
suave
refined
urbane
he
was
the
first
englishman
who
succeeded
in
writing
prose
at
once
familiar
idiomatic
to
the
very
verge
of
colloquialism
and
at
the
same
time
highly
finished
you
think
such
writing
is
easily
done
until
you
try
it
yourself
then
you
soon
find
your
mistake
iii
the
sir
roger
de
coverley
papers
the
sir
roger
de
coverley
papers
are
often
said
to
be
the
precursor
of
the
modern
english
novel
and
in
a
very
real
sense
they
are
there
are
to
be
sure
crude
specimens
of
prose
fiction
in
the
preceding
century
that
may
perhaps
dispute
this
title
though
most
of
them
like
the
romances
that
found
place
in
the
library
of
sir
lady
friend
were
of
french
origin
or
pattern
but
these
romances
while
they
supply
the
element
of
plot
and
adventure
most
liberally
were
deficient
in
genuine
characters
there
are
no
real
men
and
women
in
them
moreover
they
made
no
attempt
to
depict
contemporary
life
as
it
was
but
sir
roger
de
coverley
is
no
personage
of
romance
he
is
a
hearty
tory
gentleman
who
lives
in
worcestershire
and
he
has
no
adventures
more
striking
than
might
naturally
befall
a
country
squire
who
comes
up
to
london
for
the
season
once
a
year
there
were
scores
of
just
such
men
in
every
shire
in
england
his
speech
his
habits
his
prejudices
are
all
shown
us
with
simple
truth
and
yet
this
is
done
with
so
much
art
and
humour
that
sir
roger
is
one
of
the
most
living
persons
in
our
literature
he
is
as
immortal
as
hamlet
or
julius
c√¶sar
we
know
him
as
well
as
we
know
our
nearest
neighbour
and
we
like
him
quite
as
well
as
we
like
most
of
our
neighbours
now
this
was
something
new
in
english
literature
sir
roger
is
the
earliest
person
in
english
imaginative
prose
that
is
really
still
alive
there
are
men
and
women
in
our
poetry
before
his
day
in
the
drama
there
is
of
course
a
great
host
of
them
but
in
prose
literature
sir
roger
is
the
first
furthermore
the
men
and
women
of
the
drama
even
in
that
comedy
of
manners
which
professed
to
reflect
most
accurately
contemporary
society
were
almost
always
drawn
with
some
romantic
or
satiric
exaggeration
but
there
is
no
exaggeration
in
the
character
of
sir
roger
here
was
the
beginning
of
a
healthy
realism
it
was
only
necessary
for
richardson
and
fielding
thirty
years
later
to
bring
together
several
such
genuine
characters
into
a
group
and
to
show
how
the
incidents
of
their
lives
naturally
ran
into
plot
or
story
and
we
have
a
novel
the
original
suggestion
for
the
character
of
sir
roger
seems
to
have
come
from
steele
who
wrote
that
account
of
the
spectator
club
no
in
which
the
knight
first
appears
but
it
is
to
addison
keener
perception
and
nicer
art
that
we
owe
most
of
those
subtle
and
humorous
touches
of
characterization
which
make
the
portrait
so
real
and
so
human
there
is
more
of
movement
and
incident
in
steele
papers
and
there
is
more
of
sentiment
it
is
steele
for
example
who
tells
the
story
of
the
journey
to
london
and
recounts
the
adventures
of
the
coverley
ancestry
it
is
steele
too
who
has
most
to
say
of
the
widow
but
in
the
best
papers
by
addison
like
the
visit
to
the
abbey
or
the
evening
at
the
theater
there
is
hardly
a
line
that
does
not
reveal
in
speech
or
manner
or
notion
some
peculiarity
of
the
kindly
gentleman
we
know
and
love
so
well
if
steele
outlined
the
portrait
it
was
left
for
addison
to
elaborate
it
moreover
a
careful
reading
of
the
papers
will
show
that
steele
conception
of
the
character
was
slightly
different
from
addison
steele
sir
roger
is
whimsical
and
sentimental
but
a
man
of
good
sense
not
only
beloved
but
respected
addison
dwells
rather
upon
the
old
knight
rusticity
his
patriarchal
notions
of
society
his
ignorance
of
the
town
his
obsolete
but
kindly
prejudices
the
truth
is
that
in
addison
portrait
there
is
always
a
trace
of
covert
satire
upon
the
narrow
conservatism
of
the
tory
country
gentleman
of
his
day
sir
roger
is
amiable
and
humorous
but
he
does
not
represent
the
party
of
intelligence
and
progress
he
is
not
a
whig
yet
there
are
no
real
inconsistencies
in
the
character
of
sir
roger
his
whimsical
humor
his
sentiment
his
credulity
his
benevolence
his
amiable
though
obstinate
temper
are
all
combined
in
a
personality
so
convincing
that
we
must
always
think
of
him
as
an
actual
contemporary
of
the
men
who
created
him
he
is
the
typical
conservative
english
country
gentleman
of
the
queen
anne
time
not
taking
kindly
to
new
ideas
but
sturdy
honest
of
large
heart
and
simple
manners
to
such
men
as
he
england
owes
the
permanence
of
much
that
is
best
in
her
institutions
and
her
national
life
as
one
walks
through
westminster
abbey
listening
to
the
same
chattering
verger
that
conducted
sir
roger
he
has
been
going
his
rounds
ever
since
one
almost
expects
to
see
again
the
knight
sitting
down
in
the
coronation
chair
or
leaning
on
edward
third
sword
while
he
tells
the
discomfited
guide
the
whole
story
of
the
black
prince
out
of
chronicle
if
indeed
we
try
in
any
way
to
bring
back
to
imagination
the
life
of
that
bygone
age
sir
roger
is
sure
to
come
to
mind
at
once
at
the
assizes
at
vauxhall
or
best
of
all
at
home

he

i
have
observed
that
a
reader
seldom
peruses
a
book
with
pleasure
till
he
knows
whether
the
writer
of
it
be
a
black
or
a
fair
man
of
a
mild
or
choleric
disposition
married
or
a
bachelor
with
other
particulars
of
the
like
nature
that
conduce
very
much
to
the
right
understanding
of
an
author
to
gratify
this
curiosity
which
is
so
natural
to
a
reader
i
design
this
paper
and
my
next
as
prefatory
discourses
to
my
following
writings
and
shall
give
some
account
in
them
of
the
several
persons
that
are
engaged
in
this
work
as
the
chief
trouble
of
compiling
digesting
and
correcting
will
fall
to
my
share
i
must
do
myself
the
justice
to
open
the
work
with
my
own
history
i
was
born
to
a
small
hereditary
estate
which
according
to
the
tradition
of
the
village
where
it
lies
was
bounded
by
the
same
hedges
and
ditches
in
william
the
conqueror
time
that
it
is
at
present
and
has
been
delivered
down
from
father
to
son
whole
and
entire
without
the
loss
or
acquisition
of
a
single
field
or
meadow
during
the
space
of
six
hundred
years
there
runs
a
story
in
the
family
that
my
mother
dreamt
that
she
was
brought
to
bed
of
a
judge
whether
this
might
proceed
from
a
lawsuit
which
was
then
depending
in
the
family
or
my
father
being
a
justice
of
the
peace
i
can
not
determine
for
i
am
not
so
vain
as
to
think
it
presaged
any
dignity
that
i
should
arrive
at
in
my
future
life
though
that
was
the
interpretation
which
the
neighbourhood
put
upon
it
the
gravity
of
my
behaviour
at
my
very
first
appearance
in
the
world
and
all
the
time
that
i
sucked
seemed
to
favour
my
mother
dream
for
as
she
had
often
told
me
i
threw
away
my
rattle
before
i
was
two
months
old
and
would
not
make
use
of
my
coral
till
they
had
taken
away
the
bells
from
it
of
dark
complexion
but
it
will
be
seen
later
in
the
paper
that
the
spectator
decides
not
to
gratify
the
curiosity
of
his
readers
on
this
point
we
should
now
say
pending
a
child
toy
made
of
a
piece
of
coral
usually
with
a
whistle
at
one
end
and
bells
at
the
other
as
for
the
rest
of
my
infancy
there
being
nothing
in
it
remarkable
i
shall
pass
it
over
in
silence
i
find
that
during
my
nonage
i
had
the
reputation
of
a
very
sullen
youth
but
was
always
a
favourite
of
my
schoolmaster
who
used
to
say
that
my
parts
were
solid
and
would
wear
well
i
had
not
been
long
at
the
university
before
i
distinguished
myself
by
a
most
profound
silence
for
during
the
space
of
eight
years
excepting
in
the
public
exercises
of
the
college
i
scarce
uttered
the
quantity
of
an
hundred
words
and
indeed
do
not
remember
that
i
ever
spoke
three
sentences
together
in
my
whole
life
whilst
i
was
in
this
learned
body
i
applied
myself
with
so
much
diligence
to
my
studies
that
there
are
very
few
celebrated
books
either
in
the
learned
or
the
modern
tongues
which
i
am
not
acquainted
with
the
years
before
the
youth
comes
of
age
upon
the
death
of
my
father
i
was
resolved
to
travel
into
foreign
countries
and
therefore
left
the
university
with
the
character
of
an
odd
unaccountable
fellow
that
had
a
great
deal
of
learning
if
i
would
but
show
it
an
insatiable
thirst
after
knowledge
carried
me
into
all
the
countries
of
europe
in
which
there
was
anything
new
or
strange
to
be
seen
nay
to
such
a
degree
was
my
curiosity
raised
that
having
read
the
controversies
of
some
great
men
concerning
the
antiquities
of
egypt
i
made
a
voyage
to
grand
cairo
on
purpose
to
take
the
measure
of
a
pyramid
and
as
soon
as
i
had
set
myself
right
in
that
particular
returned
to
my
native
country
with
great
satisfaction
i
have
passed
my
latter
years
in
this
city
where
i
am
frequently
seen
in
most
public
places
though
there
are
not
above
half
a
dozen
of
my
select
friends
that
know
me
of
whom
my
next
paper
shall
give
a
more
particular
account
there
is
no
place
of
general
resort
wherein
i
do
not
often
make
my
appearance
sometimes
i
am
seen
thrusting
my
head
into
a
round
of
politicians
at
will
and
listening
with
great
attention
to
the
narratives
that
are
made
in
those
little
circular
audiences
sometimes
i
smoke
a
pipe
at
child
and
whilst
i
seem
attentive
to
nothing
but
the
overhear
the
conversation
of
every
table
in
the
room
i
appear
on
sunday
nights
at
james
and
sometimes
join
the
little
committee
of
politics
in
the
inner
room
as
one
who
comes
there
to
hear
and
improve
my
face
is
likewise
very
well
known
at
the
grecian
the
cocoa
tree
and
in
the
theatres
both
of
drury
lane
and
the
haymarket
i
have
been
taken
for
a
merchant
upon
the
exchange
for
above
these
ten
years
and
sometimes
pass
for
a
jew
in
the
assembly
of
stockjobbers
at
jonathan
in
short
wherever
i
see
a
cluster
of
people
i
always
mix
with
them
though
i
never
open
my
lips
but
in
my
own
club
thus
i
live
in
the
world
rather
as
a
spectator
of
mankind
than
as
one
of
the
species
by
which
means
i
have
made
myself
a
speculative
statesman
soldier
merchant
and
artisan
without
ever
meddling
with
any
practical
part
in
life
i
am
very
well
versed
in
the
theory
of
an
husband
or
a
father
and
can
discern
the
errors
in
the
economy
business
and
diversion
of
others
better
than
those
who
are
engaged
in
them
as
discover
blots
which
are
apt
to
escape
those
who
are
in
the
game
i
never
espoused
any
party
with
violence
and
am
resolved
to
observe
an
exact
neutrality
between
the
whigs
and
tories
unless
i
shall
be
forced
to
declare
myself
by
the
hostilities
of
either
side
in
short
i
have
acted
in
all
the
parts
of
my
life
as
a
which
is
the
character
i
intend
to
preserve
in
this
paper
a
blot
in
backgammon
is
a
man
left
uncovered
and
so
liable
to
capture
i
have
given
the
reader
just
so
much
of
my
history
and
character
as
to
let
him
see
i
am
not
altogether
unqualified
for
the
business
i
have
undertaken
as
for
other
particulars
in
my
life
and
adventures
i
shall
insert
them
in
following
papers
as
i
shall
see
occasion
in
the
mean
time
when
i
consider
how
much
i
have
seen
read
and
heard
i
begin
to
blame
my
own
taciturnity
and
since
i
have
neither
time
nor
inclination
to
communicate
the
fulness
of
my
heart
in
speech
i
am
resolved
to
do
it
in
writing
and
to
print
myself
out
if
possible
before
i
die
i
have
been
often
told
by
my
friends
that
it
is
pity
so
many
useful
discoveries
which
i
have
made
should
be
in
the
possession
of
a
silent
man
for
this
reason
therefore
i
shall
publish
a
sheetful
of
thoughts
every
morning
for
the
benefit
of
my
contemporaries
and
if
i
can
any
way
contribute
to
the
diversion
or
improvement
of
the
country
in
which
i
live
i
shall
leave
it
when
i
am
summoned
out
of
it
with
the
secret
satisfaction
of
thinking
that
i
have
not
lived
in
vain
there
are
three
very
material
points
which
i
have
not
spoken
to
in
this
paper
and
which
for
several
important
reasons
i
must
keep
to
myself
at
least
for
some
time
i
mean
an
account
of
my
name
my
age
and
my
lodgings
i
must
confess
i
would
gratify
my
reader
in
anything
that
is
reasonable
but
as
for
these
three
particulars
though
i
am
sensible
they
might
tend
very
much
to
the
embellishment
of
my
paper
i
can
not
yet
come
to
a
resolution
of
communicating
them
to
the
public
they
would
indeed
draw
me
out
of
that
obscurity
which
i
have
enjoyed
for
many
years
and
expose
me
in
public
places
to
several
salutes
and
civilities
which
have
been
always
very
disagreeable
to
me
for
the
greatest
pain
i
can
suffer
is
the
being
talked
to
and
being
stared
at
it
is
for
this
reason
likewise
that
i
keep
my
complexion
and
dress
as
very
great
secrets
though
it
is
not
impossible
but
i
may
make
discoveries
of
both
in
the
progress
of
the
work
i
have
undertaken
disclosures
after
having
been
thus
particular
upon
myself
i
shall
in
paper
give
an
account
of
those
gentlemen
who
are
concerned
with
me
in
this
work
for
as
i
have
before
intimated
a
plan
of
it
is
laid
and
concerted
as
all
other
matters
of
importance
are
in
a
club
however
as
my
friends
have
engaged
me
to
stand
in
the
front
those
who
have
a
mind
to
correspond
with
me
may
direct
their
letters
to
the
spectator
at
buckley
in
little
britain
for
i
must
further
acquaint
the
reader
that
though
our
club
meets
only
on
tuesdays
and
thursdays
we
have
appointed
a
committee
to
sit
every
night
for
the
inspection
of
all
such
papers
as
may
contribute
to
the
advancement

juv
the
first
of
our
society
is
a
gentleman
of
worcestershire
of
ancient
descent
a
baronet
his
name
sir
roger
de
coverley
his
was
inventor
of
that
famous
which
is
called
after
him
all
who
know
that
shire
are
very
well
acquainted
with
the
parts
and
merits
of
sir
roger
he
is
a
gentleman
that
is
very
singular
in
his
behaviour
but
his
singularities
proceed
from
his
good
sense
and
are
contradictions
to
the
manners
of
the
world
only
as
he
thinks
the
world
is
in
the
wrong
however
this
humour
creates
him
no
enemies
for
he
does
nothing
with
sourness
or
obstinacy
and
his
being
unconfined
to
modes
and
forms
makes
him
but
the
readier
and
more
capable
to
please
and
oblige
all
who
know
him
when
he
is
in
town
he
lives
in
soho
square
it
is
said
he
keeps
himself
a
bachelor
by
reason
he
was
crossed
in
love
by
a
perverse
beautiful
widow
of
the
next
county
to
him
before
this
disappointment
sir
roger
was
what
you
call
a
fine
gentleman
had
often
supped
with
my
lord
rochester
and
sir
george
etherege
fought
a
duel
upon
his
first
coming
to
town
and
kicked
bully
dawson
in
a
public
for
calling
him
youngster
but
being
by
the
widow
he
was
very
serious
for
a
year
and
a
half
and
though
his
temper
being
naturally
jovial
he
at
last
got
over
it
he
grew
careless
of
himself
and
never
dressed
afterwards
he
continues
to
wear
a
coat
and
doublet
of
the
same
cut
that
were
in
fashion
at
the
time
of
his
repulse
which
in
his
merry
humours
he
tells
us
has
been
in
and
out
twelve
times
since
he
first
wore
it
he
is
now
in
his
year
cheerful
gay
and
hearty
keeps
a
good
house
both
in
town
and
country
a
great
lover
of
mankind
but
there
is
such
a
mirthful
cast
in
his
behaviour
that
he
is
rather
beloved
than
esteemed
his
tenants
grow
rich
his
servants
look
satisfied
all
the
young
women
profess
love
to
him
and
the
young
men
are
glad
of
his
company
when
he
comes
into
a
house
he
calls
the
servants
by
their
names
and
talks
all
the
way
to
a
visit
i
must
not
omit
that
sir
roger
is
a
justice
of
the
quorum
that
he
fills
the
chair
at
a
quarter
session
with
great
abilities
and
three
months
ago
gained
universal
applause
by
explaining
a
passage
in
the
game
act
is
this
word
correctly
used

the
careless
use
of
pronouns
in
this
sentence
addison
would
hardly
have
written

of
the
latin
phrase

commission
issued
to
justices

once

quarter
in
the
counties
by

of

peace
the
gentleman
next
in
esteem
and
authority
among
us
is
another
bachelor
who
is
a
member
of
the
inner
temple
a
man
of
great
probity
wit
and
understanding
but
he
has
chosen
his
place
of
residence
rather
to
obey
the
direction
of
an
old
humoursome
father
than
in
pursuit
of
his
own
inclinations
he
was
placed
there
to
study
the
laws
of
the
land
and
is
the
most
learned
of
any
of
the
house
in
those
of
the
stage
aristotle
and
longinus
are
much
better
understood
by
him
than
littleton
or
coke
the
father
sends
up
every
post
questions
relating
to
leases
and
tenures
in
the
neighborhood
all
which
questions
he
agrees
with
an
attorney
to
answer
and
take
care
of
in
the
lump
he
is
studying
the
passions
themselves
when
he
should
be
inquiring
into
the
debates
among
men
which
arise
from
them
he
knows
the
argument
of
each
of
the
orations
of
demosthenes
and
tully
but
not
one
case
in
the
reports
of
our
own
courts
no
one
ever
took
him
for
a
fool
but
none
except
his
intimate
friends
know
he
has
a
great
deal
of
wit
this
turn
makes
him
at
once
both
disinterested
and
agreeable
as
few
of
his
thoughts
are
drawn
from
business
they
are
most
of
them
fit
for
conversation
his
taste
of
books
is
a
little
too
just
for
the
age
he
lives
in
he
has
read
all
but
approves
of
very
few
his
familiarity
with
the
customs
manners
actions
and
writings
of
the
ancients
makes
him
a
very
delicate
observer
of
what
occurs
to
him
in
the
present
world
he
is
an
excellent
critic
and
the
time
of
the
play
is
his
hour
of
business
exactly
at
five
he
passes
through
new
inn
crosses
through
russell
court
and
takes
a
turn
at
till
the
play
begins
he
has
his
shoes
rubbed
and
his
periwig
powdered
at
the
barber
as
you
go
into
the
rose
it
is
for
the
good
of
the
audience
when
he
is
at
a
play
for
the
actors
have
an
ambition
to
please
him
the
person
of
next
consideration
is
sir
andrew
freeport
a
merchant
of
great
eminence
in
the
city
of
london
a
person
of
indefatigable
industry
strong
reason
and
great
experience
his
notions
of
trade
are
noble
and
generous
and
as
every
rich
man
has
usually
some
sly
way
of
jesting
which
would
make
no
great
figure
were
he
not
a
rich
man
he
calls
the
sea
the
british
common
he
is
acquainted
with
commerce
in
all
its
parts
and
will
tell
you
that
it
is
a
stupid
and
barbarous
way
to
extend
dominion
by
arms
for
true
power
is
to
be
got
by
arts
and
industry
he
will
often
argue
that
if
this
part
of
our
trade
were
well
cultivated
we
should
gain
from
one
nation
and
if
another
from
another
i
have
heard
him
prove
that
diligence
makes
more
lasting
acquisitions
than
valour
and
that
sloth
has
ruined
more
nations
than
the
sword
he
abounds
in
several
frugal
maxims
amongst
which
the
greatest
favourite
is
a
penny
saved
is
a
penny
got
a
general
trader
of
good
sense
is
pleasanter
company
than
a
general
scholar
and
sir
andrew
having
a
natural
unaffected
eloquence
the
perspicuity
of
his
discourse
gives
the
same
pleasure
that
wit
would
in
another
man
he
has
made
his
fortunes
himself
and
says
that
england
may
be
richer
than
other
kingdoms
by
as
plain
methods
as
he
himself
is
richer
than
other
men
though
at
the
same
time
i
can
say
this
of
him
that
there
is
not
a
point
in
the
compass
but
blows
home
a
ship
in
which
he
is
an
owner
next
to
sir
andrew
in
the
sits
captain
sentry
a
gentleman
of
great
courage
good
understanding
but
invincible
modesty
he
is
one
of
those
that
deserve
very
well
but
are
very
awkward
at
putting
their
talents
within
the
observation
of
such
as
should
take
notice
of
them
he
was
some
years
a
captain
and
behaved
himself
with
great
gallantry
in
several
engagements
and
at
several
sieges
but
having
a
small
estate
of
his
own
and
being
next
heir
to
sir
roger
he
has
quitted
a
way
of
life
in
which
no
man
can
rise
suitably
to
his
merit
who
is
not
something
of
a
courtier
as
well
as
a
soldier
i
have
heard
him
often
lament
that
in
a
profession
where
merit
is
placed
in
so
conspicuous
a
view
impudence
should
get
the
better
of
modesty
when
he
has
talked
to
this
purpose
i
never
heard
him
make
a
sour
expression
but
frankly
confess
that
he
left
the
world
because
he
was
not
fit
for
it
a
strict
honesty
and
an
even
regular
behaviour
are
in
themselves
obstacles
to
him
that
must
press
through
crowds
who
endeavour
at
the
same
end
with
himself
the
favour
of
a
commander
he
will
however
in
his
way
of
talk
excuse
generals
for
not
disposing
according
to
men
desert
or
inquiring
into
it
for
says
he
that
great
man
who
has
a
mind
to
help
me
has
as
many
to
break
through
to
come
at
me
as
i
have
to
come
at
him
therefore
he
will
conclude
that
the
man
who
would
make
a
figure
especially
in
a
military
way
must
get
over
all
false
modesty
and
assist
his
patron
against
the
importunity
of
other
pretenders
by
a
proper
assurance
in
his
own
vindication
he
says
it
is
a
civil
cowardice
to
be
backward
in
asserting
what
you
ought
to
expect
as
it
is
a
military
fear
to
be
slow
in
attacking
when
it
is
your
duty
with
this
candour
does
the
gentleman
speak
of
himself
and
others
the
same
frankness
runs
through
all
his
conversation
the
military
part
of
his
life
has
furnished
him
with
many
adventures
in
the
relation
of
which
he
is
very
agreeable
to
the
company
for
he
is
never
overbearing
though
accustomed
to
command
men
in
the
utmost
degree
below
him
nor
ever
too
obsequious
from
an
habit
of
obeying
men
highly
above
him
is
this
a
correct
modern
use
of
the
word
can
you
express
steele
meaning
in
this
clause
more
precisely
but
that
our
society
may
not
appear
a
set
of
humorists
unacquainted
with
the
gallantries
and
pleasures
of
the
age
we
have
among
us
the
gallant
will
honeycomb
a
gentleman
who
according
to
his
years
should
be
in
the
decline
of
his
life
but
having
ever
been
very
careful
of
his
person
and
always
had
a
very
easy
fortune
time
has
made
but
very
little
impression
either
by
wrinkles
on
his
forehead
or
traces
in
his
brain
his
person
is
well
turned
of
a
good
height
he
is
very
ready
at
that
sort
of
discourse
with
which
men
usually
entertain
women
he
has
all
his
life
dressed
very
well
and
remembers
habits
as
others
do
men
he
can
smile
when
one
speaks
to
him
and
laughs
easily
he
knows
the
history
of
every
mode
and
can
inform
you
from
which
of
the
french
king
wenches
our
wives
and
daughters
had
this
manner
of
curling
their
hair
that
way
of
placing
their
hoods
and
whose
vanity
to
show
her
foot
made
that
part
of
the
dress
so
short
in
such
a
year
in
a
word
all
his
conversation
and
knowledge
has
been
in
the
female
world
as
other
men
of
his
age
will
take
notice
to
you
what
such
a
minister
said
upon
such
and
such
an
occasion
he
will
tell
you
when
the
duke
of
monmouth
danced
at
court
such
a
woman
was
then
smitten
another
was
taken
with
him
at
the
head
of
his
troop
in
the
park
in
all
these
important
relations
he
has
ever
about
the
same
time
received
a
kind
glance
or
a
blow
of
a
fan
from
some
celebrated
beauty

you

that

used
me
more
like
a

than
any
woman
i
ever
made
advances
to
this
way
of
talking
of
his
very
much
enlivens
the
conversation
among
us
of
a
more
sedate
turn
and
i
find
there
is
not
one
of
the
company
but
myself
who
rarely
speak
at
all
but
speaks
of
him
as
of
that
sort
of
man
who
is
usually
called
a
fine
gentleman
to
conclude
his
character
where
women
are
not
concerned
he
is
an
honest
worthy
man

here
i
can
not
tell
whether
i
am
to
account
him
whom
i
am
next
to
speak
of
as
one
of
our
company
for
he
visits
us
but
seldom
but
when
he
does
it
adds
to
every
man
else
a
new
enjoyment
of
himself
he
is
a
clergyman
a
very
philosophic
man
of
general
learning
great
sanctity
of
life
and
the
most
exact
good
breeding
he
has
the
misfortune
to
be
of
a
very
weak
constitution
and
consequently
can
not
accept
of
such
cares
and
business
as
preferments
in
his
function
would
oblige
him
to
he
is
therefore
among
divines
what
a
is
among
lawyers
the
probity
of
his
mind
and
the
integrity
of
his
life
create
him
followers
as
being
eloquent
or
loud
advances
others
he
seldom
introduces
the
subject
he
speaks
upon
but
we
are
so
far
gone
in
years
that
he
observes
when
he
is
among
us
an
earnestness
to
have
him
fall
on
some
divine
topic
which
he
always
treats
with
much
authority
as
one
who
has
no
interests
in
this
world
as
one
who
is
hastening
to
the
object
of
all
his
wishes
and
conceives
hope
from
his
decays
and
infirmities
these
are
my
ordinary
companions

i
know
no
evil
under
the
sun
so
great
as
the
abuse
of
the
understanding
and
yet
there
is
no
one
vice
more
common
it
has
diffused
itself
through
both
sexes
and
all
qualities
of
mankind
and
there
is
hardly
that
person
to
be
found
who
is
not
more
concerned
for
the
reputation
of
wit
and
sense
than
honesty
and
virtue
but
this
unhappy
affectation
of
being
wise
rather
than
honest
witty
than
is
the
source
of
most
of
the
ill
habits
of
life
such
false
impressions
are
owing
to
the
abandoned
writings
of
men
of
wit
and
the
awkward
imitation
of
the
rest
of
mankind
for
this
reason
sir
roger
was
saying
last
night
that
he
was
of
opinion
none
but
men
of
fine
parts
deserve
to
be
hanged
the
reflections
of
such
men
are
so
delicate
upon
all
occurrences
which
they
are
concerned
in
that
they
should
be
exposed
to
more
than
ordinary
infamy
and
punishment
for
offending
against
such
quick
admonitions
as
their
own
souls
give
them
and
blunting
the
fine
edge
of
their
minds
in
such
a
manner
that
they
are
no
more
shocked
at
vice
and
folly
than
men
of
slower
capacities
there
is
no
greater
monster
in
being
than
a
very
ill
man
of
great
parts
he
lives
like
a
man
in
a
palsy
with
one
side
of
him
dead
while
perhaps
he
enjoys
the
satisfaction
of
luxury
of
wealth
of
ambition
he
has
lost
the
taste
of
of
friendship
of
innocence
scarecrow
the
beggar
in
lincoln
inn
fields
who
disabled
himself
in
his
right
leg
and
asks
alms
all
day
to
get
himself
a
warm
supper
at
night
is
not
half
so
despicable
a
wretch
as
such
a
man
of
sense
the
beggar
has
no
relish
above
sensations
he
finds
rest
more
agreeable
than
motion
and
while
he
has
a
warm
fire
never
reflects
that
he
deserves
to
be
whipped
every
man
who
terminates
his
satisfactions
and
enjoyments
within
the
supply
of
his
own
necessities
and
passions
is
says
sir
roger
in
my
eye
as
poor
a
rogue
as
scarecrow
but
continued
he
for
the
loss
of
public
and
private
virtue
we
are
beholden
to
your
men
of
parts
forsooth
it
is
with
them
no
matter
what
is
done
so
it
is
done
with
an
air
but
to
me
who
am
so
whimsical
in
a
corrupt
age
as
to
act
according
to
nature
and
reason
a
selfish
man
in
the
most
shining
circumstance
and
equipage
appears
in
the
same
condition
with
the
fellow
but
more
contemptible
in
proportion
to
what
more
he
robs
the
public
of
and
enjoys
above
him
i
lay
it
down
therefore
for
a
rule
that
the
whole
man
is
to
move
together
that
every
action
of
any
importance
is
to
have
a
prospect
of
public
good
and
that
the
general
tendency
of
our
indifferent
actions
ought
to
be
agreeable
to
the
dictates
of
reason
of
religion
of
without
this
a
man
as
i
have
before
hinted
is
hopping
instead
of
walking
he
is
not
in
his
entire
and
proper
motion
the
fellow
above
mentioned
while
the
honest
knight
was
thus
bewildering
himself
in
good
starts
i
looked
intentively
upon
him
which
made
him
i
thought
collect
his
mind
a
little
what
i
aim
at
says
he
is
to
represent
that
i
am
of
opinion
to
polish
our
understandings
and
neglect
our
manners
is
of
all
things
the
most
inexcusable
reason
should
govern
passion
but
instead
of
that
you
see
it
is
often
subservient
to
it
and
as
unaccountable
as
one
would
think
it
a
wise
man
is
not
always
a
good
man
a
term
used
in
hunting
but
sir
roger
bewildering
himself
attentively
notice
that
the
word
is
used
in
the
broad
sense
of
conduct
this
degeneracy
is
not
only
the
guilt
of
particular
persons
but
also
at
some
times
of
a
whole
people
and
perhaps
it
may
appear
upon
examination
that
the
most
polite
ages
are
the
least
virtuous
this
may
be
attributed
to
the
folly
of
admitting
wit
and
learning
as
merit
in
themselves
without
considering
the
application
of
them
by
this
means
it
becomes
a
rule
not
so
much
to
regard
what
we
do
as
how
we
do
it
but
this
false
beauty
will
not
pass
upon
men
of
honest
minds
and
true
taste
sir
richard
blackmore
says
with
as
much
good
sense
as
virtue
it
is
a
mighty
dishonour
and
shame
to
employ
excellent
faculties
and
abundance
of
wit
to
humour
and
please
men
in
their
vices
and
follies
the
great
enemy
of
mankind
notwithstanding
his
wit
and
angelic
faculties
is
the
most
odious
being
in
the
whole
creation
he
goes
on
soon
after
to
say
very
generously
that
he
undertook
the
writing
of
his
poem
to
rescue
the
muses
to
restore
them
to
their
sweet
and
chaste
mansions
and
to
engage
them
in
an
employment
suitable
to
their
dignity
this
certainly
ought
to
be
the
purpose
of
every
man
who
appears
in
public
and
whoever
does
not
proceed
upon
that
foundation
injures
his
country
as
fast
as
he
succeeds
in
his
studies
when
modesty
ceases
to
be
the
chief
ornament
of
one
sex
and
integrity
of
the
other
society
is
upon
a
wrong
basis
and
we
shall
be
ever
after
without
rules
to
guide
our
judgment
in
what
is
really
becoming
and
ornamental
nature
and
reason
direct
one
thing
passion
and
humour
another
to
follow
the
dictates
of
the
two
latter
is
going
into
a
road
that
is
both
endless
and
intricate
when
we
pursue
the
other
our
passage
is
delightful
and
what
we
aim
at
easily
attainable
i
do
not
doubt
but
england
is
at
present
as
polite
a
nation
as
any
in
the
world
but
any
man
who
thinks
can
easily
see
that
the
affectation
of
being
gay
and
in
fashion
has
very
near
eaten
up
our
good
sense
and
our
religion
is
there
anything
so
just
as
that
mode
and
gallantry
should
be
built
upon
exerting
ourselves
in
what
is
proper
and
agreeable
to
the
institutions
of
justice
and
piety
among
us
and
yet
is
there
anything
more
common
than
that
we
run
in
perfect
contradiction
to
them
all
which
is
supported
by
no
other
pretension
than
that
it
is
done
with
what
we
call
a
good
grace
fashion
politeness
fine
manner
does
this
sentence
seem
obscure
or
cumbrous
can
you
improve
it
nothing
ought
to
be
held
laudable
or
becoming
but
what
nature
itself
should
prompt
us
to
think
so
respect
to
all
kind
of
superiors
is
founded
methinks
upon
instinct
and
yet
what
is
so
ridiculous
as
age
i
make
this
abrupt
transition
to
the
mention
of
this
vice
more
than
any
other
in
order
to
introduce
a
little
story
which
i
think
a
pretty
instance
that
the
most
polite
age
is
in
danger
of
being
the
most
vicious
what
seems
nowadays
so
ridiculous
the
vice
of
disrespect
for
age
it
happened
at
athens
during
a
public
representation
of
some
play
exhibited
in
honor
of
the
commonwealth
that
an
old
gentleman
came
too
late
for
a
place
suitable
to
his
age
and
quality
many
of
the
young
gentlemen
who
observed
the
difficulty
and
confusion
he
was
in
made
signs
to
him
that
they
would
accommodate
him
if
he
came
where
they
sat
the
good
man
bustled
through
the
crowd
accordingly
but
when
he
came
to
the
seats
to
which
he
was
invited
the
jest
was
to
sit
close
and
expose
him
as
he
stood
out
of
countenance
to
the
whole
audience
the
frolic
went
round
all
the
athenian
benches
but
on
those
occasions
there
were
also
particular
places
assigned
for
foreigners
when
the
good
man
skulked
towards
the
boxes
appointed
for
the
lacedemonians
that
honest
people
more
virtuous
than
polite
rose
up
all
to
a
man
and
with
the
greatest
respect
received
him
among
them
the
athenians
being
suddenly
touched
with
a
sense
of
the
spartan
virtue
and
their
own
degeneracy
gave
a
thunder
of
applause
and
the
old

the
club
of
which
i
am
a
member
is
very
luckily
composed
of
such
persons
as
are
engaged
in
different
ways
of
life
and
deputed
as
it
were
out
of
the
most
conspicuous
classes
of
mankind
by
this
means
i
am
furnished
with
the
greatest
variety
of
hints
and
materials
and
know
everything
that
passes
in
the
different
quarters
and
divisions
not
only
of
this
great
city
but
of
the
whole
kingdom
my
readers
too
have
the
satisfaction
to
find
that
there
is
no
rank
or
degree
among
them
who
have
not
their
representative
in
this
club
and
that
there
is
always
somebody
present
who
will
take
care
of
their
respective
interests
that
nothing
may
be
written
or
published

the
prejudice
or

i
last
night
sat
very
late
in
company
with
this
select
body
of
friends
who
entertained
me
with
several
remarks
which
they
and
others
had
made
upon
these
my
speculations
as
also
with
the
various
success
which
they
had
met
with
among
their
several
ranks
and
degrees
of
readers
will
honeycomb
told
me
in
the
softest
manner
he
could
that
there
were
some
ladies
but
for
your
comfort
says
will
they
are
not
those
of
the
most
wit
that
were
offended
at
the
liberties
i
had
taken
with
the
opera
and
the
that
some
of
them
were
likewise
very
much
surprised
that
i
should
think
such
serious
points
as
the
dress
and
equipage
of
persons
of
quality
proper
subjects
for
raillery
what
is
the
antecedent
he
was
going
on
when
sir
andrew
freeport
took
him
up
short
and
told
him
that
the
papers
he
hinted
at
had
done
great
good
in
the
city
and
that
all
their
wives
and
daughters
were
the
better
for
them
and
further
added
that
the
whole
city
thought
themselves
very
much
obliged
to
me
for
declaring
my
generous
intentions
to
scourge
vice
and
folly
as
they
appear
in
a
multitude
without
condescending
to
be
a
publisher
of
particular
intrigues
in
short
says
sir
andrew
if
you
avoid
that
foolish
beaten
road
of
falling
upon
aldermen
and
citizens
and
employ
your
pen
upon
the
vanity
and
luxury
of
courts
your
paper
must
needs
be
of
general
use
whose
upon
this
my
friend
the
templar
told
sir
andrew
that
he
wondered
to
hear
a
man
of
his
sense
talk
after
that
manner
that
the
city
had
always
been
the
province
for
satire
and
that
the
wits
of
king
charles
time
jested
upon
nothing
else
during
his
whole
reign
he
then
showed
by
the
examples
of
horace
juvenal
boileau
and
the
best
writers
of
every
age
that
the
follies
of
the
stage
and
court
had
never
been
accounted
too
sacred
for
ridicule
how
great
soever
the
persons
might
be
that
patronized
them
but
after
all
says
he
i
think
your
raillery
has
made
too
great
an
excursion
in
attacking
several
persons
of
the
inns
of
court
and
i
do
not
believe
you
can
show
me
any
precedent
for
your
behaviour
in
that
particular
my
good
friend
sir
roger
de
coverley
who
had
said
nothing
all
this
while
began
his
speech
with
a
pish
and
told
us
that
he
wondered
to
see
so
many
men
of
sense
so
very
serious
upon
fooleries
let
our
good
friend
says
he
attack
every
one
that
deserves
it
i
would
only
advise
you
spectator
applying
himself
to
me
to
take
care
how
you
meddle
with
country
squires
they
are
the
ornaments
of
the
english
nation
men
of
good
heads
and
sound
bodies
and
let
me
tell
you
some
of
them
take
it
ill
of
you
that
you
mention
fox
hunters
with
so
little
respect
captain
sentry
spoke
very
sparingly
on
this
occasion
what
he
said
was
only
to
commend
my
prudence
in
not
touching
upon
the
army
and
advised
me
to
continue
to
act
discreetly
in
that
point
by
this
time
i
found
every
subject
of
my
speculations
was
taken
away
from
me
by
one
or
other
of
the
club
and
began
to
think
myself
in
the
condition
of
the
good
man
that
had
one
wife
who
took
a
dislike
to
his
gray
hairs
and
another
to
his
black
till
by
their
picking
out
what
each
of
them
had
an
aversion
to
they
left
his
head
altogether
bald
and
naked
while
i
was
thus
musing
with
myself
my
worthy
friend
the
clergyman
who
very
luckily
for
me
was
at
the
club
that
night
undertook
my
cause
he
told
us
that
he
wondered
any
order
of
persons
should
think
themselves
too
considerable
to
be
advised
that
it
was
not
quality
but
innocence
which
exempted
men
from
reproof
that
vice
and
folly
ought
to
be
attacked
wherever
they
could
be
met
with
and
especially
when
they
were
placed
in
high
and
conspicuous
stations
of
life
he
further
added
that
my
paper
would
only
serve
to
aggravate
the
pains
of
poverty
if
it
chiefly
exposed
those
who
are
already
depressed
and
in
some
measure
turned
into
ridicule
by
the
meanness
of
their
conditions
and
circumstances
he
afterwards
proceeded
to
take
notice
of
the
great
use
this
paper
might
be
of
to
the
public
by
reprehending
those
vices
which
are
too
trivial
for
the
chastisement
of
the
law
and
too
fantastical
for
the
cognizance
of
the
pulpit
he
then
advised
me
to
prosecute
my
undertaking
with
cheerfulness
and
assured
me
that
whoever
might
be
displeased
with
me
i
should
be
approved
by
all
those
whose
praises
do
honour
to
the
persons
on
whom
they
are
bestowed
the
whole
club
pays
a
particular
deference
to
the
discourse
of
this
gentleman
and
are
drawn
into
what
he
says
as
much
by
the
candid
ingenuous
manner
with
which
he
delivers
himself
as
by
the
strength
of
argument
and
force
of
reason
which
he
makes
use
of
will
honeycomb
immediately
agreed
that
what
he
had
said
was
right
and
that
for
his
part
he
would
not
insist
upon
the
quarter
which
he
had
demanded
for
the
ladies
sir
andrew
gave
up
the
city
with
the
same
frankness
the
templar
would
not
stand
out
and
was
followed
by
sir
roger
and
the
captain
who
all
agreed
that
i
should
be
at
liberty
to
carry
the
war
into
what
quarter
i
pleased
provided
i
continued
to
combat
with
criminals
in
a
body
and
to
assault
the
vice
without
hurting
the
person
this
debate
which
was
held
for
the
good
of
mankind
put
me
in
mind
of
that
which
the
roman
triumvirate
were
formerly
engaged
in
for
their
destruction
every
man
at
first
stood
hard
for
his
friend
till
they
found
that
by
this
means
they
should
spoil
their
proscription
and
at
length
making
a
sacrifice
of
all
their
acquaintance
and
relations
furnished
out
a
very
decent
execution
having
thus
taken
my
resolutions
to
march
on
boldly
in
the
cause
of
virtue
and
good
sense
and
to
annoy
their
adversaries
in
whatever
degree
or
rank
of
men
they
may
be
found
i
shall
be
deaf
for
the
future
to
all
the
remonstrances
that
shall
be
made
to
me
on
this
account
if
punch
grows
extravagant
i
shall
reprimand
him
very
freely
if
the
stage
becomes
a
nursery
of
folly
and
impertinence
i
shall
not
be
afraid
to
animadvert
upon
it
in
short
if
i
meet
with
anything
in
city
court
or
country
that
shocks
modesty
or
good
manners
i
shall
use
my
utmost
endeavours
to
make
an
example
of
it
i
must
however
intreat
every
particular
person
who
does
me
the
honour
to
be
a
reader
of
this
paper
never
to
think
himself
or
any
one
of
his
friends
or
enemies
aimed
at
in
what
is
said
for
i
promise
him
never
to
draw
a
faulty
character
which
does
not
fit
at
least
a
thousand
people
or
to
publish
a
single
paper
that
is
not
written
in
the
spirit
of
benevolence
and
with
a
love
to
mankind

some
months
ago
my
friend
sir
roger
being
in
the
country
enclosed
a
letter
to
me
directed
to
a
certain
lady
whom
i
shall
here
call
by
the
name
of
leonora
and
as
it
contained
matters
of
consequence
desired
me
to
deliver
it
to
her
with
my
own
hand
accordingly
i
waited
upon
her
ladyship
pretty
early
in
the
morning
and
was
desired
by
her
woman
to
walk
into
her
lady
library
till
such
time
as
she
was
in
a
readiness
to
receive
me
the
very
sound
of
a
lady
library
gave
me
a
great
curiosity
to
see
it
and
as
it
was
some
time
before
the
lady
came
to
me
i
had
an
opportunity
of
turning
over
a
great
many
of
her
books
which
were
ranged
together
in
a
very
beautiful
order
at
the
end
of
the
folios
which
were
finely
bound
and
gilt
were
great
jars
of
china
placed
one
above
another
in
a
very
noble
piece
of
architecture
the
quartos
were
separated
from
the
octavos
by
a
pile
of
smaller
vessels
which
rose
in
a
delightful
pyramid
the
octavos
were
bounded
by
of
all
shapes
colours
and
sizes
which
were
so
disposed
on
a
wooden
frame
that
they
looked
like
one
continued
pillar
indented
with
the
finest
strokes
of
sculpture
and
stained
with
the
greatest
variety
of
dyes
that
part
of
the
library
which
was
designed
for
the
reception
of
plays
and
pamphlets
and
other
loose
papers
was
enclosed
in
a
kind
of
square
consisting
of
one
of
the
prettiest
grotesque
works
that
ever
i
saw
and
made
up
of
scaramouches
lions
monkeys
mandarins
trees
shells
and
a
thousand
other
odd
figures
in
china
ware
in
the
midst
of
the
room
was
a
little
japan
table
with
a
quire
of
gilt
paper
upon
it
and
on
the
paper
a
silver
snuff
box
made
in
the
shape
of
a
little
book
i
found
there
were
several
other
counterfeit
books
upon
the
upper
shelves
which
were
carved
in
wood
and
served
only
to
fill
up
the
number
like
fagots
in
the
muster
of
a
regiment
i
was
wonderfully
pleased
with
such
a
mixed
kind
of
furniture
as
seemed
very
suitable
both
to
the
lady
and
the
scholar
and
did
not
know
at
first
whether
i
should
fancy
myself
in
a
grotto
or
in
a
library
a
person
formerly
hired
to
take
the
place
of
another
at
the
muster
of
a
military
company
or
to
hide
deficiency
in
its
number
when
it
was
not
full
upon
my
looking
into
the
books
i
found
there
were
some
few
which
the
lady
had
bought
for
her
own
use
but
that
most
of
them
had
been
got
together
either
because
she
had
heard
them
praised
or
because
she
had
seen
the
authors
of
them
among
several
that
i

i
was
taking
a

in

of
these
and
several
other
authors
when
leonora
entered
and
upon
my
presenting
her
with
the
letter
from
the
knight
told
me
with
an
unspeakable
grace
that
she
hoped
sir
roger
was
in
good
health
i
answered
yes
for
i
hate
long
speeches
and
after
a
bow
or
two
retired
leonora
was
formerly
a
celebrated
beauty
and
is
still
a
very
lovely
woman
she
has
been
a
widow
for
two
or
three
years
and
being
unfortunate
in
her
first
marriage
has
taken
a
resolution
never
to
venture
upon
a
second
she
has
no
children
to
take
care
of
and
leaves
the
management
of
her
estate
to
my
good
friend
sir
roger
but
as
the
mind
naturally
sinks
into
a
kind
of
lethargy
and
falls
asleep
that
is
not
agitated
by
some
favourite
pleasures
and
pursuits
leonora
has
turned
all
the
passions
of
her
sex
into
a
love
of
books
and
retirement
she
converses
chiefly
with
men
as
she
has
often
said
herself
but
it
is
only
in
their
writings
and
admits
of
very
few
male
visitants
except
my
friend
sir
roger
whom
she
hears
with
great
pleasure
and
without
scandal
rearrange
this
sentence
as
her
reading
has
lain
very
much
among
romances
it
has
given
her
a
very
particular
turn
of
thinking
and
discovers
itself
even
in
her
house
her
gardens
and
her
furniture
sir
roger
has
entertained
me
an
hour
together
with
a
description
of
her
country
seat
which
is
situated
in
a
kind
of
wilderness
about
an
hundred
miles
distant
from
london
and
looks
like
a
little
enchanted
palace
the
rocks
about
her
are
shaped
into
artificial
grottoes
covered
with
woodbines
and
jessamines
the
woods
are
cut
into
shady
walks
twisted
into
bowers
and
filled
with
cages
of
turtles
the
springs
are
made
to
run
among
pebbles
and
by
that
means
taught
to
murmur
very
agreeably
they
are
likewise
collected
into
a
beautiful
lake
that
is
inhabited
by
a
couple
of
swans
and
empties
itself
by
a
little
rivulet
which
runs
through
a
green
meadow
and
is
known
in
the
family
by
the
name
of
the
purling
stream
turtle
doves
the
knight
likewise
tells
me
that
this
lady
preserves
her
game
better
than
any
of
the
gentlemen
in
the
country
not
says
sir
roger
that
she
sets
so
great
a
value
upon
her
partridges
and
pheasants
as
upon
her
larks
and
nightingales
for
she
says
that
every
bird
which
is
killed
in
her
ground
will
spoil
a
consort
and
that
she
shall
certainly
miss
him
the
next
year
concert
when
i
think
how
oddly
this
lady
is
improved
by
learning
i
look
upon
her
with
a
mixture
of
admiration
and
pity
amidst
these
innocent
entertainments
which
she
has
formed
to
herself
how
much
more
valuable
does
she
appear
than
those
of
her
sex
who
employ
themselves
in
diversions
that
are
less
reasonable
though
more
in
fashion
what
improvements
would
a
woman
have
made
who
is
so
susceptible
of
impressions
from
what
she
reads
had
she
been
guided
to
such
books
as
have
a
tendency
to
enlighten
the
understanding
and
rectify
the
passions
as
well
as
to
those
which
are
of
little
more
use
than
to
divert
the
imagination
but
the
manner
of
a
lady
employing
herself
usefully
in
reading
shall
be
the
subject
of
another
paper
in
which
i
design
to
recommend
such
particular
books
as
may
be
proper
for
the
improvement
of
the
sex
and
as
this
is
a
subject
of
a
very
nice
nature
i
shall
desire
my
correspondents
to
give
me
their
thoughts

the
country
come
to
see
him
he
only
shows
me
at
a
distance
as
i
have
been
walking
in
his
fields
i
have
observed
them
stealing
a
sight
of
me
over
an
hedge
and
have
heard
the
knight
desiring
them
not
to
let
me
see
them
for
that
i
hated
to
be
stared
at
i
am
the
more
at
ease
in
sir
roger
family
because
it
consists
of
sober
and
staid
persons
for
as
the
knight
is
the
best
master
in
the
world
he
seldom
changes
his
servants
and
as
he
is
beloved
by
all
about
him
his
servants
never
care
for
leaving
him
by
this
means
his
domestics
are
all
in
years
and
grown
old
with
their
master
you
would
take
his
de
for
his
brother
his
butler
is
his
groom
is
one
of
the
gravest
men
that
i
have
ever
seen
and
his
coachman
has
the
looks
of
a
privy
counsellor
you
see
the
goodness
of
the
master
even
in
the
old
house
dog
and
in
a
gray
pad
that
is
kept
in
the
stable
with
great
care
and
tenderness
out
of
regard
to
his
past
services
though
he
has
been
useless
for
several
years
an
horse
i
could
not
but
observe
with
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
the
joy
that
appeared
in
the
countenances
of
these
ancient
domestics
upon
my
friend
arrival
at
his
country
seat
some
of
them
could
not
refrain
from
tears
at
the
sight
of
their
old
master
every
one
of
them
pressed
forward
to
do
something
for
him
and
seemed
discouraged
if
they
were
not
employed
at
the
same
time
the
good
old
knight
with
a
mixture
of
the
father
and
the
master
of
the
family
tempered
the
inquiries
after
his
own
affairs
with
several
kind
questions
relating
to
themselves
this
humanity
and
good
nature
engages
everybody
to
him
so
that
when
he
is
pleasant
upon
any
of
them
all
his
family
are
in
good
humour
and
none
so
much
as
the
person
whom
he
diverts
himself
with
on
the
contrary
if
he
coughs
or
betrays
any
infirmity
of
old
age
it
is
easy
for
a
to
observe
a
secret
concern
in
the
looks
of
all
of
his
servants
my
worthy
friend
has
put
me
under
the
particular
care
of
his
butler
who
is
a
very
prudent
man
and
as
well
as
the
rest
of
his
wonderfully
desirous
of
pleasing
me
because
they
have
often
heard
their
master
talk
of
me
as
of
his
particular
friend
my
chief
companion
when
sir
roger
is
diverting
himself
in
the
woods
or
the
fields
is
a
very
venerable
man
who
is
ever
with
sir
roger
and
has
lived
at
his
house
in
the
nature
of
a
chaplain
above
thirty
years
this
gentleman
is
a
person
of
good
sense
and
some
learning
of
a
very
regular
life
and
obliging
conversation
he
heartily
loves
sir
roger
and
knows
that
he
is
very
much
in
the
old
knight
esteem
so
that
he
lives
in
the
family
rather
as
a
relation
than
a
dependant
in
the
capacity
of
a
chaplain
i
have
observed
in
several
of
my
papers
that
my
friend
sir
roger
amidst
all
his
good
qualities
is
something
of
an
humorist
and
that
his
virtues
as
well
as
imperfections
are
as
it
were
tinged
by
a
certain
extravagance
which
makes
them
particularly
and
distinguishes
them
from
those
of
other
men
this
cast
of
mind
as
it
is
generally
very
innocent
in
itself
so
it
renders
his
conversation
highly
agreeable
and
more
delightful
than
the
same
degree
of
sense
and
virtue
would
appear
in
their
common
and
ordinary
colours
as
i
was
walking
with
him
last
night
he
asked
me
how
i
liked
the
good
man
whom
i
have
just
now
mentioned
and
without
staying
for
my
answer
told
me
that
he
was
afraid
of
being
insulted
with
latin
and
greek
at
own
table
for
which
reason
he
desired
a
particular
friend
of
his
at
the
university
to
find
him
out
a
clergyman
rather
of
plain
sense
than
much
learning
of
a
good
aspect
a
clear
voice
a
sociable
temper
and
if
possible
a
man
that
understood
a
little
of
backgammon
my
friend
says
sir
roger
found
me
out
this
gentleman
who
besides
the
endowments
required
of
him
is
they
tell
me
a
good
scholar
though
he
does
not
show
it
i
have
given
him
the
parsonage
of
the
parish
and
because
i
know
his
value
have
settled
upon
him
a
good
annuity
for
life
if
he
outlives
me
he
shall
find
that
he
was
higher
in
my
esteem
than
perhaps
he
thinks
he
is
he
has
now
been
with
me
thirty
years
and
though
he
does
not
know
i
have
taken
notice
of
it
has
never
in
all
that
time
asked
anything
of
me
for
himself
though
he
is
every
day
soliciting
me
for
something
in
behalf
of
one
or
other
of
my
tenants
his
parishioners
there
has
not
been
a
lawsuit
in
the
parish
since
he
has
lived
among
them
if
any
dispute
arises
they
apply
themselves
to
him
for
the
decision
if
they
do
not
acquiesce
in
his
judgment
which
i
think
never
happened
above
once
or
twice
at
most
they
appeal
to
me
at
his
first
settling
with
me
i
made
him
a
present
of
all
the
good
sermons
which
have
been
printed
in
english
and
only
begged
of
him
that
every
sunday
he
would
pronounce
one
of
them
in
the
pulpit
accordingly
he
has
digested
them
into
such
a
series
that
they
follow
one
another
naturally
and
make
a
continued
system
of
practical
divinity
the
earlier
and
more
proper
sense
of
the
word
a
person
of
pleasing
eccentricity
as
sir
roger
was
going
on
in
his
story
the
gentleman
we
were
talking
of
came
up
to
us
and
upon
the
asking
him
who
preached
for
it
was
saturday
night
told
us
the
bishop
of
asaph
in
the
morning
and
south
in
the
afternoon
he
then
showed
us
his
list
of
preachers
for
the
whole
year
where
i
saw
with
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
archbishop
tillotson
bishop
saunderson
barrow
calamy
with
several
living
authors
who
have
published
discourses
of
practical
divinity
i
no
sooner
saw
this
venerable
man
in
the
pulpit
but
i
very
much
approved
of
my
friend
insisting
upon
the
qualifications
of
a
good
aspect
and
a
clear
voice
for
i
was
so
charmed
with
the
gracefulness
of
his
figure
and
delivery
as
well
as
with
the
discourses
he
pronounced
that
i
think
i
never
passed
any
time
more
to
my
satisfaction
a
sermon
repeated
after
this
manner
is
like
the
composition
of
a
poet
in
the
mouth
of
a
graceful
actor
i
could
heartily
wish
that
more
of
our
country
clergy
would
follow
this
example
and
instead
of
wasting
their
spirits
in
laborious
compositions
of
their
own
would
endeavor
after
a
handsome
elocution
and
all
those
other
talents
that
are
proper
to
enforce
what
has
been
penned
by
greater
masters
this
would
not
only
be
more
easy
to
themselves
but
more
edifying
to
the
people

the
reception
manner
of

undisturbed
freedom
and
quiet
which
i
meet
with
here
in
the
country
has
confirmed
me
in
the
opinion
i
always
had
that
the
general
corruption
of
manners
in
servants
is
owing
to
the
conduct
of
masters
the
aspect
of
every
one
in
the
family
carries
so
much
satisfaction
that
it
appears
he
knows
the
happy
lot
which
has
befallen
him
in
being
a
member
of
it
there
is
one
particular
which
i
have
seldom
seen
but
at
sir
roger
it
is
usual
in
all
other
places
that
servants
fly
from
the
parts
of
the
house
through
which
their
master
is
passing
on
the
contrary
here
they
industriously
place
themselves
in
his
way
and
it
is
on
both
sides
as
it
were
understood
as
a
visit
when
the
servants
appear
without
calling
this
proceeds
from
the
humane
and
equal
temper
of
the
man
of
the
house
who
also
perfectly
well
knows
how
to
enjoy
a
great
estate
with
such
economy
as
ever
to
be
much
beforehand
this
makes
his
own
mind
untroubled
and
consequently
unapt
to
vent
peevish
expressions
or
give
passionate
or
inconsistent
orders
to
those
about
him
thus
respect
and
love
go
together
and
a
certain
cheerfulness
in
performance
of
their
duty
is
the
particular
distinction
of
the
lower
part
of
this
family
when
a
servant
is
called
before
his
master
he
does
not
come
with
an
expectation
to
hear
himself
rated
for
some
trivial
fault
threatened
to
be
stripped
or
used
with
any
other
unbecoming
language
which
mean
masters
often
give
to
worthy
servants
but
it
is
often
to
know
what
road
he
took
that
he
came
so
readily
back
according
to
order
whether
he
passed
by
such
a
ground
if
the
old
man
who
rents
it
is
in
good
health
or
whether
he
gave
sir
roger
love
to
him
or
the
like
stripped
of
his
livery
dismissed
a
man
who
preserves
a
respect
founded
on
his
benevolence
to
his
dependants
lives
rather
like
a
prince
than
a
master
in
his
family
his
orders
are
received
as
favours
rather
than
duties
and
the
distinction
of
approaching
him
is
part
of
the
reward
for
executing
what
is
commanded
by
him
there
is
another
circumstance
in
which
my
friend
excels
in
his
management
which
is
the
manner
of
rewarding
his
servants
he
has
ever
been
of
opinion
that
giving
his
cast
clothes
to
be
worn
by
valets
has
a
very
ill
effect
upon
little
minds
and
creates
a
silly
sense
of
equality
between
the
parties
in
persons
affected
only
with
outward
things
i
have
heard
him
often
pleasant
on
this
occasion
and
describe
a
young
gentleman
abusing
his
man
in
that
coat
which
a
month
or
two
before
was
the
most
pleasing
distinction
he
was
conscious
of
in
himself
he
would
turn
his
discourse
still
more
pleasantly
upon
the
ladies
bounties
of
this
kind
and
i
have
heard
him
say
he
knew
a
fine
woman
who
distributed
rewards
and
punishments
in
giving
becoming
or
unbecoming
dresses
to
her
maids
humorous
on
this
matter
while
the
man
was
wearing
that
coat
but
my
good
friend
is
above
these
little
instances
of
in
bestowing
only
trifles
on
his
servants
a
good
servant
to
him
is
sure
of
having
it
in
his
choice
very
soon
of
being
no
servant
at
all
as
i
before
observed
he
is
so
good
an
husband
and
knows
so
thoroughly
that
the
skill
of
the
purse
is
the
cardinal
virtue
of
this
life
i
say
he
knows
so
well
that
frugality
is
the
support
of
generosity
that
he
can
often
spare
a
large
fine
when
a
tenement
falls
and
give
that
settlement
to
a
good
servant
who
has
a
mind
to
go
into
the
world
or
make
a
stranger
pay
the
fine
to
that
servant
for
his
more
comfortable
maintenance
if
he
stays
in
his
service
economist
the
verb
is
still
used
in
that
sense
a
fine
in
english
law
is
a
sum
of
money
paid
by
a
tenant
at
the
beginning
of
his
tenancy
usually
to
reduce
his
rent
when
the
right
to
occupy
a
house
or
lands
terminates
by
expiration
of
lease
or
otherwise
the
usual
term
is
falls
in
the
meaning
of
the
whole
passage
is
that
when
a
tenement
house
or
lands
is
to
be
rented
sir
roger
often
grants
it
to
one
of
his
servants
without
requiring
payment
of
the
customary
fine
on
taking
possession
or
if
the
servant
choose
to
remain
with
sir
roger
he
may
have
the
fine
paid
by
the
stranger
who
leases
the
property
a
man
of
honour
and
generosity
considers
it
would
be
miserable
to
himself
to
have
no
will
but
that
of
another
though
it
were
of
the
best
person
breathing
and
for
that
reason
goes
on
as
fast
as
he
is
able
to
put
his
servants
into
independent
livelihoods
the
greatest
part
of
sir
roger
estate
is
tenanted
by
persons
who
have
served
himself
or
his
ancestors
it
was
to
me
extremely
pleasant
to
observe
the
visitants
from
several
parts
to
welcome
his
arrival
into
the
country
and
all
the
difference
that
i
could
take
notice
of
between
the
late
servants
who
came
to
see
him
and
those
who
stayed
in
the
family
was
that
these
latter
were
looked
upon
as
finer
gentlemen
and
better
courtiers
recent
former
this
manumission
and
placing
them
in
a
way
of
livelihood
i
look
upon
as
only
what
is
due
to
a
good
servant
which
encouragement
will
make
his
successor
be
as
diligent
as
humble
and
as
ready
as
he
was
there
is
something
wonderful
in
the
narrowness
of
those
minds
which
can
be
pleased
and
be
barren
of
bounty
to
those
who
please
them
one
might
on
this
occasion
recount
the
sense
that
great
persons
in
all
ages
have
had
of
the
merit
of
their
dependants
and
the
heroic
services
which
men
have
done
their
masters
in
the
extremity
of
their
fortunes
and
shown
to
their
undone
patrons
that
fortune
was
all
the
difference
between
them
but
as
i
design
this
my
speculation
only
as
a
gentle
admonition
to
thankless
masters
i
shall
not
go
out
of
the
occurrences
of
common
life
but
assert
it
as
a
general
observation
that
i
never
saw
but
in
sir
family
and
one
or
two
more
good
servants
treated
as
they
ought
to
be
sir
roger
kindness
extends
to
their
children
children
and
this
very
morning
he
sent
his
coachman
grandson
to
prentice
i
shall
conclude
this
paper
with
an
account
of
a
picture
in
his
gallery
where
there
are
many
which
will
deserve
my
future
observation
at
the
very
upper
end
of
this
handsome
structure
i
saw
the
portraiture
of
two
young
men
standing
in
a
river
the
one
naked
the
other
in
a
livery
the
person
supported
seemed
half
dead
but
still
so
much
alive
as
to
show
in
his
face
exquisite
joy
and
love
towards
the
other
i
thought
the
fainting
figure
resembled
my
friend
sir
roger
and
looking
at
the
butler
who
stood
by
me
for
an
account
of
it
he
informed
me
that
the
person
in
the
livery
was
a
servant
of
sir
roger
who
stood
on
the
shore
while
his
master
was
swimming
and
observing
him
taken
with
some
sudden
illness
and
sink
under
water
jumped
in
and
saved
him
he
told
me
sir
roger
took
off
the
dress
he
was
in
as
soon
as
he
came
home
and
by
a
great
bounty
at
that
time
followed
by
his
favour
ever
since
had
made
him
master
of
that
pretty
seat
which
we
saw
at
a
distance
as
we
came
to
this
house
i
remembered
indeed
sir
roger
said
there
lived
a
very
worthy
gentleman
to
whom
he
was
highly
obliged
without
mentioning
anything
further
upon
my
looking
a
little
dissatisfied
at
some
part
of
the
picture
my
attendant
informed
me
that
it
was
against
sir
roger
will
and
at
the
earnest
request
of
the
gentleman
himself
that
he
was
drawn
in
the
habit
in
which
he
had
saved
his
master

use
of

i
twisted

serve
you
all
the
time

are
in
the
country

have
not
been

this
extraordinary
letter
and
message
that
accompanied
it
made
me
very
curious
to
know
the
character
and
quality
of
the
gentleman
who
sent
them
which
i
found
to
be
as
follows
will
wimble
is
younger
brother
to
a
baronet
and
descended
of
the
ancient
family
of
the
wimbles
he
is
now
between
forty
and
fifty
but
being
bred
to
no
business
and
born
to
no
estate
he
generally
lives
with
his
elder
brother
as
superintendent
of
his
game
he
hunts
a
pack
of
dogs
better
than
any
man
in
the
country
and
is
very
famous
for
finding
out
a
hare
he
is
extremely
well
versed
in
all
the
little
handicrafts
of
an
idle
man
he
makes
a
to
a
miracle
and
furnishes
the
whole
country
with
as
he
is
a
officious
fellow
and
very
much
esteemed
upon
account
of
his
family
he
is
a
welcome
guest
at
every
house
and
keeps
up
a
good
correspondence
among
all
the
gentlemen
about
him
he
carries
a

his
pocket
from
one
to
another

couple

friends

the
opposite
sides

the
county

a
particular
favourite
of
all
the
young
heirs
whom
he
frequently
obliges
with
a
net
that
he
has
weaved
or
a
that
he
has
made
himself
he
now
and
then
presents
a
pair
of
garters
of
his
own
knitting
to
their
mothers
or
sisters
and
raises
a
great
deal
of
mirth
among
them
by
inquiring
as
often
as
he
meets
them
how
they
wear
these
manufactures

little
humours

trained
sir
roger
was
proceeding
in
the
character
of
him
when
he
saw
him
make
up
to
us
with
two
or
three
hazel
twigs
in
his
hand
that
he
had
cut
in
sir
roger
woods
as
he
came
through
them
in
his
way
to
the
house
i
was
very
much
pleased
to
observe
on
one
side
the
hearty
and
sincere
welcome
with
which
sir
roger
received
him
and
on
the
other
the
secret
joy
which
his
guest
discovered
at
sight
of
the
good
old
knight
after
the
first
salutes
were
over
will
desired
sir
roger
to
lend
him
one
of
his
servants
to
carry
a
set
of
shuttlecocks
he
had
with
him
in
a
little
box
to
a
lady
that
lived
about
a
mile
off
to
whom
it
seems
he
had
promised
such
a
present
for
above
this
half
year
sir
roger
back
was
no
sooner
turned
but
honest
will
began
to
tell
me
of
a
large
that
he
had
sprung
in
one
of
the
neighbouring
woods
with
two
or
three
other
adventures
of
the
same
nature
odd
and
uncommon
characters
are
the
game
that
i
look
for
and
most
delight
in
for
which
reason
i
was
as
much
pleased
with
the
novelty
of
the
person
that
talked
to
me
as
he
could
be
for
his
life
with
the
springing
of
a
pheasant
and
therefore
listened
to
him
with
more
than
ordinary
attention
in
the
midst
of
his
discourse
the
bell
rung
to
dinner
where
the
gentleman
i
have
been
speaking
of
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
the
huge
jack
he
had
caught
served
up
for
the
first
dish
in
a
most
sumptuous
manner
upon
our
sitting
down
to
it
he
gave
us
a
long
account
how
he
had
hooked
it
played
with
it
foiled
it
and
at
length
drew
it
out
upon
the
bank
with
several
other
particulars
that
lasted
all
the
first
course
a
dish
of
wild
fowl
that
came
afterwards
furnished
conversation
for
the
rest
of
the
dinner
which
concluded
with
a
late
invention
of
for
improving
the
a
pipe
to
imitate
the
call
of
a
quail
upon
withdrawing
into
my
room
after
dinner
i
was
secretly
touched
with
compassion
towards
the
honest
gentleman
that
had
dined
with
us
and
could
not
but
consider
with
a
great
deal
of
concern
how
so
good
an
heart
and
such
busy
hands
were
wholly
employed
in
trifles
that
so
much
humanity
should
be
so
little
beneficial
to
others
and
so
much
industry
so
little
advantageous
to
himself
the
same
temper
of
mind
and
application
to
affairs
might
have
recommended
him
to
the
public
esteem
and
have
raised
his
fortune
in
another
station
of
life
what
good
to
his
country
or
himself
might
not
a
trader
or
merchant
have
done
with
such
useful
though
ordinary
qualifications
will
wimble
is
the
case
of
many
a
younger
brother
of
a
great
family
who
had
rather
see
their
children
starve
like
gentlemen
than
thrive
in
a
trade
or
profession
that
is
beneath
their
quality
this
humour
fills
several
parts
of
europe
with
pride
and
beggary
it
is
the
happiness
of
a
trading
nation
like
ours
that
the
younger
sons
though
uncapable
of
any
liberal
art
or
profession
may
be
placed
in
such
a
way
of
life
as
may
perhaps
enable
them
to
vie
with
the
best
of
their
family
accordingly
we
find
several
citizens
that
were
launched
into
the
world
with
narrow
fortunes
rising
by
an
honest
industry
to
greater
estates
than
those
of
their
elder
brothers
it
is
not
improbable
but
will
was
formerly
tried
at
divinity
law
or
physic
and
that
finding
his
genius
did
not
lie
that
way
his
parents
gave
him
up
at
length
to
his
own
inventions
but
certainly
however
improper
he
might
have
been
for
studies
of
a
higher
nature
he
was
perfectly
well
turned
for
the
occupations
of
trade
and
commerce
as
i
think
this
is
a
point
which
can
not
be
too
much
inculcated
i
shall
desire
my
reader
to
compare
what
i
have
here
written
with
what
i
have
said
in
my
speculation
unfit

sapiens
hor
i
was
this
morning
walking
in
the
gallery
when
sir
roger
entered
at
the
end
opposite
to
me
and
advancing
towards
me
said
he
was
glad
to
meet
me
among
his
relations
the
de
coverleys
and
hoped
i
liked
the
conversation
of
so
much
good
company
who
were
as
silent
as
myself
i
knew
he
alluded
to
the
pictures
and
as
he
is
a
gentleman
who
does
not
a
little
value
himself
upon
his
ancient
descent
i
expected
he
would
give
me
some
account
of
them
we
were
now
arrived
at
the
upper
end
of
the
gallery
when
the
knight
faced
towards
one
of
the
pictures
and
as
we
stood
before
it
he
entered
into
the
matter
after
his
blunt
way
of
saying
things
as
they
occur
to
his
imagination
without
regular
introduction
or
care
to
preserve
the
appearance
of
chain
of
thought
it
is
said
he
worth
while
to
consider
the
force
of
dress
and
how
the
persons
of
one
age
differ
from
those
of
another
merely
by
that
only
one
may
observe
also
that
the
general
fashion
of
one
age
has
been
followed
by
one
particular
set
of
people
in
another
and
by
them
preserved
from
one
generation
to
another
thus
the
vast
jetting
coat
and
small
bonnet
which
was
the
habit
in
harry
the
seventh
time
is
kept
on
in
the
yeomen
of
the
guard
not
without
a
good
and
politic
view
because
they
look
a
foot
taller
and
a
foot
and
an
half
broader
besides
that
the
cap
leaves
the
face
expanded
and
consequently
more
terrible
and
fitter
to
stand
at
the
entrance
of
palaces
costume
this
predecessor
of
ours
you
see
is
dressed
after
this
manner
and
his
cheeks
would
be
no
larger
than
mine
were
he
in
a
hat
as
i
am
he
was
the
last
man
that
won
a
prize
in
the
which
is
now
a
common
street
before
whitehall
you
see
the
broken
lance
that
lies
there
by
his
right
foot
he
shivered
that
lance
of
his
adversary
all
to
pieces
and
bearing
himself
look
you
sir
in
this
manner
at
the
same
time
he
came
within
the
target
of
the
gentleman
who
rode
against
him
and
taking
him
with
incredible
force
before
him
on
the
pommel
of
his
saddle
he
in
that
manner
rid
the
tournament
over
with
an
air
that
showed
he
did
it
rather
to
perform
the
rule
of
the
lists
than
expose
his
enemy
however
it
appeared
he
knew
how
to
make
use
of
a
victory
and
with
a
gentle
trot
he
marched
up
to
a
gallery
where
their
mistress
sat
for
they
were
rivals
and
let
him
down
with
laudable
courtesy
and
pardonable
insolence
i
know
but
it
might
be
exactly
where
the
is
now
the
law
of
the
tournament
you
are
to
know
this
my
ancestor
was
not
only
of
a
military
genius
but
fit
also
for
the
arts
of
peace
for
he
played
on
the
bass
viol
as
well
as
any
gentleman
at
court
you
see
where
his
viol
hangs
by
his
sword
the
action
at
the
you
may
be
sure
won
the
fair
lady
who
was
a
maid
of
honour
and
the
greatest
beauty
of
her
time
here
she
stands
the
next
picture
you
see
sir
my
has
on
the
petticoat
except
that
the
modern
is
gathered
at
the
waist
my
grandmother
appears
as
if
she
stood
in
a
large
drum
whereas
the
ladies
now
walk
as
if
they
were
in
a
for
all
this
lady
was
bred
at
court
she
became
an
excellent
country
wife
she
brought
ten
children
and
when
i
show
you
the
library
you
shall
see
in
her
own
hand
allowing
for
the
difference
of
the
language
the
best
receipt
now
in
england
both
for
an
and
a
if
you
please
to
fall
back
a
little
because
is
necessary
to
look
at
the
three
next
pictures
at
one
view
these
are
three
sisters
she
on
the
right
hand
who
is
so
very
beautiful
died
a
maid
the
next
to
her
still
handsomer
had
the
same
fate
against
her
will
this
homely
thing
in
the
middle
had
both
their
portions
added
to
her
own
and
was
stolen
by
a
neighbouring
gentleman
a
man
of
stratagem
and
resolution
for
he
poisoned
three
mastiffs
to
come
at
her
and
knocked
down
two
in
carrying
her
off
misfortunes
happen
in
all
families
the
theft
of
this
romp
and
so
much
money
was
no
great
matter
to
our
estate
but
the
next
heir
that
possessed
it
was
this
soft
gentleman
whom
you
see
there
observe
the
small
buttons
the
little
boots
the
laces
the
slashes
about
his
clothes
and
above
all
the
posture
he
is
drawn
in
which
to
be
sure
was
his
own
choosing
you
see
he
sits
with
one
hand
on
a
desk
writing
and
looking
as
it
were
another
way
like
an
easy
writer
or
a
sonneteer
he
was
one
of
those
that
had
too
much
wit
to
know
how
to
live
in
the
world
he
was
a
man
of
no
justice
but
great
good
manners
he
ruined
everybody
that
had
anything
to
do
with
him
but
never
said
a
rude
thing
in
his
life
the
most
indolent
person
in
the
world
he
would
sign
a
deed
that
passed
away
half
his
estate
with
his
gloves
on
but
would
not
put
on
his
hat
before
a
lady
if
it
were
to
save
his
country
he
is
said
to
be
the
first
that
made
love
by
squeezing
the
hand
he
left
the
estate
with
ten
thousand
pounds
debt
upon
it
but
however
by
all
hands
i
have
been
informed
that
he
was
every
way
the
finest
gentleman
in
the
world
that
debt
lay
heavy
on
our
house
for
one
generation
but
it
was
retrieved
by
a
gift
from
that
honest
man
you
see
there
a
citizen
of
our
name
but
nothing
at
all
akin
to
us
i
know
sir
andrew
freeport
has
said
behind
my
back
that
this
man
was
descended
from
one
of
the
ten
children
of
the
maid
of
honour
i
showed
you
above
but
it
was
never
made
out
we
winked
at
the
thing
indeed
because
money
was
wanting
at
that
time
the
estate
here
i
saw
my
friend
a
little
embarrassed
and
turned
my
face
to
the
next
portraiture
sir
roger
went
on
with
his
account
of
the
gallery
in
the
following
manner
this
man
pointing
to
him
i
looked
at
i
take
to
be
the
honour
of
our
house
sir
humphrey
de
coverley
he
was
in
his
dealings
as
punctual
as
a
tradesman
and
as
generous
as
a
gentleman
he
would
have
thought
himself
as
much
undone
by
breaking
his
word
as
if
it
were
to
be
followed
by
bankruptcy
he
served
his
country
as
knight
of
this
shire
to
his
dying
day
he
found
it
no
easy
matter
to
maintain
an
integrity
in
his
words
and
actions
even
in
things
that
regarded
the
offices
which
were
incumbent
upon
him
in
the
care
of
his
own
affairs
and
relations
of
life
and
therefore
dreaded
though
he
had
great
talents
to
go
into
employments
of
state
where
he
must
be
exposed
to
the
snares
of
ambition
innocence
of
life
and
great
ability
were
the
distinguishing
parts
of
his
character
the
latter
he
had
often
observed
had
led
to
the
destruction
of
the
former
and
used
frequently
to
lament
that
and
had
not
the
same
signification
he
was
an
excellent
husbandman
but
had
resolved
not
to
exceed
such
a
degree
of
wealth
all
above
it
he
bestowed
in
secret
bounties
many
years
after
the
sum
he
aimed
at
for
his
own
use
was
attained
yet
he
did
not
slacken
his
industry
but
to
a
decent
old
age
spent
the
life
and
fortune
which
was
superfluous
to
himself
in
the
service
of
his
friends
and
neighbours
representative
of
the
shire

economist
here
we
were
called
to
dinner
and
sir
roger
ended
the
discourse
of
this
gentleman
by
telling
me
as
we
followed
the
servant
that
this
his
ancestor
was
a
brave
man
and
narrowly
escaped
being
killed
in
the
civil
wars
for
said
he
he
was
sent
out
of
the
field
upon
a
private
message
the
day
before
the
battle
of
worcester
the
whim
of
narrowly
escaping
by
having
been
within
a
day
of
danger
with
other
matters
above
mentioned
mixed
with
good
sense
left
me
at
a
loss
whether
i
was
more
delighted
with
my
friend
wisdom

simplicity

at
a

distance
from

house
among
the
ruins
of
an
old
abbey
there
is
a
long
walk
of
aged
elms
which
are
shot
up
so
very
high
that
when
one
passes
under
them
the
rooks
and
crows
that
rest
upon
the
tops
of
them
seem
to
be
cawing
in
another

i
am
very
much
delighted
with
this
sort
of
noise
which
i
consider
as
a
kind
of
natural
prayer
to
that
being
who
supplies
the
wants
of
his
whole
creation
and
who
in
the
beautiful

of

psalms
feedeth

call
upon
him
i
like
this
retirement
the
better
because
of

it
lies
under

as
i
have
been
told
in

no

ever
walks
in

besides
the
chaplain
my
good
friend
the
butler
desired
me
with
a
very
grave
face
not
to
venture
myself
in
it
after
sunset
for
that
one
of
the
footmen
had
been
almost
frighted
out
of
his
wits
by
a
spirit
that
appeared
to
him
in
the
shape
of
a
black
horse
without
an
head
to
which
he
added
that
about
a
month
ago
one
of
the
maids
coming
home
late
that
way
with
a
pail
of
milk
upon
her
head
heard
such
a
rustling
among
the
bushes
that
she
let
it
fall
i
was
taking
a
walk
in
this
place
last
night
between
the
hours
of
nine
and
ten
and
could
not
but
fancy
it
one
of
the
most
proper
scenes
in
the
world
for
a
ghost
to
appear
in
the
ruins
of
the
abbey
are
scattered
up
and
down
on
every
side
and
half
covered
with
ivy
and
elder
bushes
the
harbours
of
several
solitary
birds
which
seldom
make
their
appearance
till
the
dusk
of
the
evening
the
place
was
formerly
a
and
has
still
several
marks
in
it
of
graves
and
there
is
such
an
echo
among
the
old
ruins
and
vaults
that
if
you
stamp
but
a
little
louder
than
ordinary
you
hear
the
sound
repeated
at
the
same
time
the
walk
of
elms
with
the
croaking
of
the
ravens
which
from
time
to
time
are
heard
from
the
tops
of
them
looks
exceeding
solemn
and
venerable
these
objects
naturally
raise
seriousness
and
attention
and
when
night
heightens
the
awfulness
of
the
place
and
pours
out
her
supernumerary
horrors
upon
everything
in
it
i
do
not
at
all
wonder
that
weak
minds
fill
it
with
spectres
and
apparitions
locke
in
his
chapter
of
the
association
of
ideas
has
very
curious
remarks
to
show
how
by
the
prejudice
of
education
one
idea
often
introduces
into
the
mind
a
whole
set
that
bear
no
resemblance
to
one
another
in
the
nature
of
things
among
several
examples
of
this
kind
he
produces
the
following
instance
the
ideas
of
goblins
and
sprites
have
really
no
more
to
do
with
darkness
than
light
yet
let
but
a
foolish
maid
inculcate
these
often
on
the
mind
of
a
child
and
raise
them
there
together
possibly
he
shall
never
be
able
to
separate
them
again
so
long
as
he
lives
but
darkness
shall
ever
afterwards
bring
with
it
those
frightful
ideas
and
they
shall
be
so
joined
that
he
can
no
more
bear
the
one
than
the
other
is
the
thought
expressed
with
precision
as
i
was
walking
in
this
solitude
where
the
dusk
of
the
evening
conspired
with
so
many
other
occasions
of
terror
i
observed
a
cow
grazing
not
far
from
me
which
an
imagination
that
is
apt
to
startle
might
easily
have
construed
into
a
black
horse
without
an
head
and
i
dare
say
the
poor
footman
lost
his
wits
upon
some
such
trivial
occasion
my
friend
sir
roger
has
often
told
me
with
a
great
deal
of
mirth
that
at
his
first
coming
to
his
estate
he
found
three
parts
of
his
house
altogether
useless
that
the
best
room
in
it
had
the
reputation
of
being
haunted
and
by
that
means
was
locked
up
that
noises
had
been
heard
in
his
long
gallery
so
that
he
could
not
get
a
servant
to
enter
it
after
eight
at
night
that
the
door
of
one
of
his
chambers
was
nailed
up
because
there
went
a
story
in
the
family
that
a
butler
had
formerly
hanged
himself
in
it
and
that
his
mother
who
lived
to
a
great
age
had
shut
up
half
the
rooms
in
the
house
in
which
either
her
husband
a
son
or
daughter
had
died
the
knight
seeing
his
habitation
reduced
to
so
small
a
compass
and
himself
in
a
manner
shut
out
of
his
own
house
upon
the
death
of
his
mother
ordered
all
the
apartments
to
be
flung
open
and
exorcised
by
his
chaplain
who
lay
in
every
room
one
after
another
and
by
that
means
dissipated
the
fears
which
had
so
long
reigned
in
the
family
i
should
not
have
been
thus
particular
upon
these
ridiculous
horrors
did
not
i
find
them
so
very
much
prevail
in
all
parts
of
the
country
at
the
same
time
i
think
a
person
who
is
thus
terrified
with
the
imagination
of
ghosts
and
spectres
much
more
reasonable
than
one
who
contrary
to
the
reports
of
all
historians
sacred
and
profane
ancient
and
modern
and
to
the
traditions
of
all
nations
thinks
the
appearance
of
spirits
fabulous
and
groundless
could
not
i
give
myself
up
to
this
general
testimony
of
mankind
i
should
to
the
relations
of
particular
persons
who
are
now
living
and
whom
i
can
not
distrust
in
other
matters
of
fact
i
might
here
add
that
not
only
the
historians
to
whom
we
may
join
the
poets
but
likewise
the
philosophers
of
antiquity
have
favoured
this
opinion
lucretius
himself
though
by
the
course
of
his
philosophy
he
was
obliged
to
maintain
that
the
soul
did
not
exist
separate
from
the
body
makes
no
doubt
of
the
reality
of
apparitions
and
that
men
have
often
appeared
after
their
death
this
i
think
very
remarkable
he
was
so
pressed
with
the
matter
of
fact
which
he
could
not
have
the
confidence
to
deny
that
he
was
forced
to
account
for
it
by
one
of
the
most
absurd
unphilosophical
notions
that
was
ever
started
he
tells
us
that
the
surfaces
of
all
bodies
are
perpetually
flying
off
from
their
respective
bodies
one
after
another
and
that
these
surfaces
or
thin
cases
that
included
each
other
whilst
they
were
joined
in
the
body
like
the
coats
of
an
onion
are
sometimes
seen
entire
when
they
are
separated
from
it
by
which
means
we
often
behold
the
shapes
and
shadows
of
persons
who
are
either
dead
or
absent
i
shall
dismiss
this
paper
with
a
story
out
of
josephus
not
so
much
for
the
sake
of
the
story
itself
as
for
the
moral
reflections
with
which
the
author
concludes
it
and
which
i
shall
here
set
down
in
his
own
words
glaphyra
the
daughter
of
king
archelaus
after
the
death
of
her
two
first
husbands
being
married
to
a
third
who
was
brother
to
her
first
husband
and
so
passionately
in
love
with
her
that
he
turned
off
his
former
wife
to
make
room
for
this
marriage
had
a
very
odd
kind
of
dream
she
fancied
that
she
saw
her
first
husband
coming
towards
her
and
that
she
embraced
him
with
great
tenderness
when
in
the
midst
of
the
pleasure
which
she
expressed
at
the
sight
of
him
he
reproached
her
after
the
following
manner
says
he
hast
made
good
the
old
saying
that
women
are
not
to
be
trusted
was
not
i
the
husband
of
thy
virginity
have
i
not
children
by
thee
how
couldst
thou
forget
our
loves
so
far
as
to
enter
into
a
second
marriage
and
after
that
into
a
third
however
for
the
sake
of
our
past
loves
i
shall
free
thee
from
thy
present
reproach
and
make
thee
mine
for
ever
glaphyra
told
this
dream
to
several
women
of
her
acquaintance
and
died
soon
after
i
thought
this
story
might
not
be
impertinent
in
this
place
wherein
i
speak
of
those
kings
besides
that
the
example
deserves
to
be
taken
notice
of
as
it
contains
a
most
certain
proof
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
and
of
divine
providence
if
any
man
thinks
these
facts
incredible
let
him
enjoy
his
own
opinion
to
himself
but
let
him
not
endeavour
to
disturb
the
belief
of
others
who
by
instances
of
this
nature
are
excited
to
the
study
of
virtue

i
am
always
very
well
pleased
with
a
country
sunday
and
think
if
keeping
holy
the
seventh
day
were
only
a
human
institution
it
would
be
the
best
method
that
could
have
been
thought
of
for
the
polishing
and
civilizing
of
mankind
it
is
certain
the
country
people
would
soon
degenerate
into
a
kind
of
savages
and
barbarians
were
there
not
such
frequent
returns
of
a
stated
time
in
which
the
whole
village
meet
together
with
their
best
faces
and
in
their
cleanliest
habits
to
converse
with
one
another
upon
indifferent
subjects
hear
their
duties
explained
to
them
and
join
together
in
adoration
of
the
supreme
being
sunday
clears
away
the
rust
of
the
whole
week
not
only
as
it
refreshes
in
their
minds
the
notions
of
religion
but
as
it
puts
both
the
sexes
upon
appearing
in
their
most
agreeable
forms
and
exerting
all
such
qualities
as
are
apt
to
give
them
a
figure
in
the
eye
of
the
village
a
country
fellow
distinguishes
himself
as
much
in
the
as
a
citizen
does
upon
the
change
the
whole
parish
politics
being
generally
discussed
at
that
place
either
after
sermon
or
before
the
bell
rings
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
word
here
short
for
exchange
my
friend
sir
roger
being
a
good
churchman
has
beautified
the
inside
of
his
church
with
several
texts
of
his
own
choosing
he
has
likewise
given
a
handsome
pulpit
cloth
and
railed
in
the
communion
table
at
his
own
expense
he
has
often
told
me
that
at
his
coming
to
his
estate
he
found
his
parishioners
very
irregular
and
that
in
order
to
make
them
kneel
and
join
in
the
responses
he
gave
every
one
of
them
a
hassock
and
a
common
prayer
book
and
at
the
same
time
employed
an
itinerant
who
goes
about
the
country
for
that
purpose
to
instruct
them
rightly
in
the
tunes
of
the
psalms
upon
which
they
now
very
much
value
themselves
and
indeed
outdo
most
of
the
country
churches
that
i
have
ever
heard
as
sir
roger
is
landlord
to
the
whole
congregation
he
keeps
them
in
very
good
order
and
will
suffer
nobody
to
sleep
in
it
besides
himself
for
if
by
chance
he
has
been
surprised
into
a
short
nap
at
sermon
upon
recovering
out
of
it
he
stands
up
and
looks
about
him
and
if
he
sees
anybody
else
nodding
either
wakes
them
himself
or
sends
his
servant
to
them
several
other
of
the
old
knight
particularities
break
out
upon
these
occasions
sometimes
he
will
be
lengthening
out
a
verse
in
the
singing
psalms
half
a
minute
after
the
rest
of
the
congregation
have
done
with
it
sometimes
when
he
is
pleased
with
the
matter
of
his
devotion
he
pronounces
amen
three
or
four
times
to
the
same
prayer
and
sometimes
stands
up
when
everybody
else
is
upon
their
knees
to
count
the
congregation
or
see
if
any
of
his
tenants
are
missing
peculiarities
correct
the
english
i
was
yesterday
very
much
surprised
to
hear
my
old
friend
in
the
midst
of
the
service
calling
out
to
one
john
matthews
to
mind
what
he
was
about
and
not
disturb
the
congregation
this
john
matthews
it
seems
is
remarkable
for
being
an
idle
fellow
and
at
that
time
was
kicking
his
heels
for
his
diversion
this
authority
of
the
knight
though
exerted
in
that
odd
manner
which
accompanies
him
in
all
circumstances
of
life
has
a
very
good
effect
upon
the
parish
who
are
not
polite
enough
to
see
anything
ridiculous
in
his
behaviour
besides
that
the
general
good
sense
and
worthiness
of
his
character
makes
his
friends
observe
these
little
singularities
as
foils
that
rather
set
off
than
blemish
his
good
qualities
as
soon
as
the
sermon
is
finished
nobody
presumes
to
stir
till
sir
roger
is
gone
out
of
the
church
the
knight
walks
down
from
his
seat
in
the
chancel
between
a
double
row
of
his
tenants
that
stand
bowing
to
him
on
each
side
and
every
now
and
then
inquires
how
such
an
wife
or
mother
or
son
or
father
do
whom
he
does
not
see
at
church
which
is
understood
as
a
secret
reprimand
to
the
person
that
is
absent
the
chaplain
has
often
told
me
that
upon
a
catechizing
day
when
sir
roger
had
been
pleased
with
a
boy
that
answers
well
he
has
ordered
a
bible
to
be
given
him
next
day
for
his
encouragement
and
sometimes
accompanies
it
with
a
flitch
of
bacon
to
his
mother
sir
roger
has
likewise
added
five
pounds
a
year
to
the
clerk
place
and
that
he
may
encourage
the
young
fellows
to
make
themselves
perfect
in
the
church
service
has
promised
upon
the
death
of
the
present
incumbent
who
is
very
old
to
bestow
it
according
to
merit
the
fair
understanding
between
sir
roger
and
his
chaplain
and
their
mutual
concurrence
in
doing
good
is
the
more
remarkable
because
the
very
next
village
is
famous
for
the
differences
and
contentions
that
rise
between
the
parson
and
the
squire
who
live
in
a
perpetual
state
of
war
the
parson
is
always
preaching
at
the
squire
and
the
squire
to
be
revenged
on
the
parson
never
comes
to
church
the
squire
has
made
all
his
tenants
atheists
and
tithe
stealers
while
the
parson
instructs
them
every
sunday
in
the
dignity
of
his
order
and
insinuates
to
them
in
almost
every
sermon
that
he
is
a
better
man
than
his
patron
in
short
matters
are
come
to
such
an
extremity
that
the
squire
has
not
said
his
prayers
either
in
public
or
private
this
half
year
and
that
the
parson
threatens
him
if
he
does
not
mend
his
manners
to
pray
for
him
in
the
face
of
the
whole
congregation
feuds
of
this
nature
though
too
frequent
in
the
country
are
very
fatal
to
the
ordinary
people
who
are
so
used
to
be
dazzled
with
riches
that
they
pay
as
much
deference
to
the
understanding
of
a
man
of
an
estate
as
of
a
man
of
learning
and
are
very
hardly
brought
to
regard
any
truth
how
important
soever
it
may
be
that
is
preached
to
them
when
they
know
there
are
several
men
of
five
hundred
a
year
who
do
not
believe
it
who
have
an
income
of
five
hundred
pounds

year

in
my
first
description
of
the
company
in
which
i
pass
most
of
my
time
it
may
be
remembered
that
i
mentioned
a
great
affliction
which
my
friend
sir
roger
had
met
with
in
his
youth
which
was
no
less
than
a
disappointment
in
love
it
happened
this
evening
that
we
fell
into
a
very
pleasing
walk
at
a
distance
from
his
house
as
soon
as
we
came
into
it
it
is
quoth
the
good
old
man
looking
round
him
with
a
smile
very
hard
that
any
part
of
my
land
should
be
settled
upon
one
who
has
used
me
so
ill
as
the
perverse
widow
did
and
yet
i
am
sure
i
could
not
see
a
sprig
of
any
bough
of
this
whole
walk
of
trees
but
i
should
reflect
upon
her
and
her
severity
she
has
certainly
the
finest
hand
of
any
woman
in
the
world
you
are
to
know
this
was
the
place
wherein
i
used
to
muse
upon
her
and
by
that
custom
i
can
never
come
into
it
but
the
same
tender
sentiments
revive
in
my
mind
as
if
i
had
actually
walked
with
that
beautiful
creature
under
these
shades
i
have
been
fool
enough
to
carve
her
name
on
the
bark
of
several
of
these
trees
so
unhappy
is
the
condition
of
men
in
love
to
attempt
the
removing
of
their
passion
by
the
methods
which
serve
only
to
imprint
it
deeper
she
has
certainly
the
finest
hand
of
any
woman
in
the
world
here
followed
a
profound
silence
and
i
was
not
displeased
to
observe
my
friend
falling
so
naturally
into
a
discourse
which
i
had
ever
before
taken
notice
he
industriously
avoided
after
a
very
long
pause
he
entered
upon
an
account
of
this
great
circumstance
in
his
life
with
an
air
which
i
thought
raised
my
idea
of
him
above
what
i
had
ever
had
before
and
gave
me
the
picture
of
that
cheerful
mind
of
his
before
it
received
that
stroke
which
has
ever
since
affected
his
words
and
actions
but
he
went
on
as
follows
i
came
to
my
estate
in
my
year
and
resolved
to
follow
the
steps
of
the
most
worthy
of
my
ancestors
who
have
inhabited
this
spot
of
earth
before
me
in
all
the
methods
of
hospitality
and
good
neighbourhood
for
the
sake
of
my
fame
and
in
country
sports
and
recreations
for
the
sake
of
my
health
in
my
year
i
was
obliged
to
serve
as
sheriff
of
the
county
and
in
my
servants
officers
and
whole
equipage
indulged
the
pleasure
of
a
young
man
who
did
not
think
ill
of
his
own
person
in
taking
that
public
occasion
of
showing
my
figure
and
behaviour
to
advantage
you
may
easily
imagine
to
yourself
what
appearance
i
made
who
am
pretty
tall
rid
well
and
was
very
well
dressed
at
the
head
of
a
whole
county
with
music
before
me
a
feather
in
my
hat
and
my
horse
well
bitted
i
can
assure
you
i
was
not
a
little
pleased
with
the
kind
looks
and
glances
i
had
from
all
the
balconies
and
windows
as
i
rode
to
the
hall
where
the
assizes
were
held
but
when
i
came
there
a
beautiful
creature
in
a
widow
habit
sat
in
court
to
hear
the
event
of
a
cause
concerning
her
dower
this
commanding
creature
who
was
born
for
destruction
of
all
who
behold
her
put
on
such
a
resignation
in
her
countenance
and
bore
the
whispers
of
all
around
the
court
with
such
a
pretty
uneasiness
i
warrant
you
and
then
recovered
herself
from
one
eye
to
another
till
she
was
perfectly
confused
by
meeting
something
so
wistful
in
all
she
encountered
that
at
last
with
a
murrain
to
her
she
cast
her
bewitching
eye
upon
me
i
no
sooner
met
it
but
i
bowed
like
a
great
surprised
booby
and
knowing
her
cause
to
be
the
first
which
came
on
i
cried
like
a
captivated
calf
as
i
was
way
for
the
defendant
witnesses
this
sudden
partiality
made
all
the
county
immediately
see
the
sheriff
also
was
become
a
slave
to
the
fine
widow
during
the
time
her
cause
was
upon
trial
she
behaved
herself
i
warrant
you
with
such
a
deep
attention
to
her
business
took
opportunities
to
have
little
billets
handed
to
her
counsel
then
would
be
in
such
a
pretty
confusion
occasioned
you
must
know
by
acting
before
so
much
company
that
not
only
i
but
the
whole
court
was
prejudiced
in
her
favour
and
all
that
the
next
heir
to
her
husband
had
to
urge
was
thought
so
groundless
and
frivolous
that
when
it
came
to
her
counsel
to
reply
there
was
not
half
so
much
said
as
every
one
besides
in
the
court
thought
he
could
have
urged
to
her
advantage
you
must
understand
sir
this
perverse
woman
is
one
of
those
unaccountable
creatures
that
secretly
rejoice
in
the
admiration
of
men
but
indulge
themselves
in
no
further
consequences
hence
it
is
that
she
has
ever
had
a
train
of
admirers
and
she
removes
from
her
slaves
in
town
to
those
in
the
country
according
to
the
seasons
of
the
year
she
is
a
reading
lady
and
far
gone
in
the
pleasures
of
friendship
she
is
always
accompanied
by
a
confidante
who
is
witness
to
her
daily
protestations
against
our
sex
and
consequently
a
bar
to
her
first
steps
towards
love
upon
the
strength
of
her
own
maxims
and
declarations
outcome
issue
notice
the
etymology
of
the
word
with
a
plague
upon
her
however
i
must
needs
say
this
accomplished
mistress
of
mine
has
distinguished
me
above
the
rest
and
has
been
known
to
declare
sir
roger
de
coverley
was
the
tamest
and
most
human
of
all
the
brutes
in
the
country
i
was
told
she
said
so
by
one
who
thought
he
rallied
me
but
upon
the
strength
of
this
slender
encouragement
of
being
thought
least
detestable
i
made
new
liveries
my
sent
them
all
to
town
to
be
bitted
and
taught
to
throw
their
legs
well
and
move
altogether
before
i
pretended
to
cross
the
country
and
wait
upon
her
as
soon
as
i
thought
my
retinue
suitable
to
the
character
of
my
fortune
and
youth
i
set
out
from
hence
to
make
my
addresses
the
particular
skill
of
this
lady
has
ever
been
to
inflame
your
wishes
and
yet
command
respect
to
make
her
mistress
of
this
art
she
has
a
greater
share
of
knowledge
wit
and
good
sense
than
is
usual
even
among
men
of
merit
then
she
is
beautiful
beyond
the
race
of
women
if
you
wo
let
her
go
on
with
a
certain
artifice
with
her
eyes
and
the
skill
of
beauty
she
will
arm
herself
with
her
real
charms
and
strike
you
with
admiration
instead
of
desire
it
is
certain
that
if
you
were
to
behold
the
whole
woman
there
is
that
dignity
in
her
aspect
that
composure
in
her
motion
that
complacency
in
her
manner
that
if
her
form
makes
you
hope
her
merit
makes
you
fear
but
then
again
she
is
such
a
desperate
scholar
that
no
country
gentleman
can
approach
her
without
being
a
jest
as
i
was
going
to
tell
you
when
i
came
to
her
house
i
was
admitted
to
her
presence
with
great
civility
at
the
same
time
she
placed
herself
to
be
first
seen
by
me
in
such
an
attitude
as
i
think
you
call
the
posture
of
a
picture
that
she
discovered
new
charms
and
i
at
last
came
towards
her
with
such
an
awe
as
made
me
speechless
this
she
no
sooner
observed
but
she
made
her
advantage
of
it
and
began
a
discourse
to
me
concerning
love
and
honour
as
they
both
are
followed
by
pretenders
and
the
real
votaries
to
them
when
she
had
discussed
these
points
in
a
discourse
which
i
verily
believe
was
as
learned
as
the
best
philosopher
in
europe
could
possibly
make
she
asked
me
whether
she
was
so
happy
as
to
fall
in
with
my
sentiments
on
these
important
particulars
her
confidante
sat
by
her
and
upon
my
being
in
the
last
confusion
and
silence
this
malicious
aid
of
hers
turning
to
her
says
am
very
glad
to
observe
sir
roger
pauses
upon
this
subject
and
seems
resolved
to
deliver
all
his
sentiments
upon
the
matter
when
he
pleases
to
speak
they
both
kept
their
countenances
and
after
i
had
sat
half
an
hour
meditating
how
to
behave
before
such
profound
casuists
i
rose
up
and
took
my
leave
chance
has
since
that
time
thrown
me
very
often
in
her
way
and
she
as
often
has
directed
a
discourse
to
me
which
i
do
not
understand
this
barbarity
has
kept
me
ever
at
a
distance
from
the
most
beautiful
object
my
eyes
ever
beheld
it
is
thus
also
she
deals
with
all
mankind
and
you
must
make
love
to
her
as
you
would
conquer
the
sphinx
by
posing
her
but
were
she
like
other
women
and
that
there
were
any
talking
to
her
how
constant
must
the
pleasure
of
that
man
be
who
could
converse
with
a
creature
but
after
all
you
may
be
sure
her
heart
is
fixed
on
some
one
or
other
and
yet
i
have
been
credibly
informed
but
who
can
believe
half
that
is
said
after
she
had
done
speaking
to
me
she
put
her
hand
to
her
bosom
and
adjusted
her
tucker
then
she
cast
her
eyes
a
little
down
upon
my
beholding
her
too
earnestly
they
say
she
sings
excellently
her
voice
in
her
ordinary
speech
has
something
in
it
inexpressibly
sweet
you
must
know
i
dined
with
her
at
a
public
table
the
day
after
i
first
saw
her
and
she
helped
me
to
some
tansy
in
the
eye
of
all
the
gentlemen
in
the
country
she
has
certainly
the
finest
hand
of
any
woman
in
the
world
i
can
assure
you
sir
were
you
to
behold
her
you
would
be
in
the
same
condition
for
as
her
speech
is
music
her
form
is
angelic
but
i
find
i
grow
irregular
while
i
am
talking
of
her
but
indeed
it
would
be
stupidity
to
be
unconcerned
at
such
perfection
oh
the
excellent
creature
she
is
as
inimitable
to
all
women
as
she
is
inaccessible
to
all
men
the
word
seems
not
to
be
used
with
precision
here
to
pose
is
to
silence
or
nonplus
one
by
puzzling
or
unanswerable
questions
it
was
the
sphinx
that
posed
all
comers
with
her
famous
riddle
till
≈ìdipus
answered
it
i
found
my
friend
begin
to
rave
and
insensibly
led
him
towards
the
house
that
we
might
be
joined
by
some
other
company
and
am
convinced
that
the
widow
is
the
secret
cause
of
all
that
inconsistency
which
appears
in
some
parts
of
my
friend
discourse
though
he
has
so
much
command
of
himself
as
not
directly
to
mention
her
yet
according
to
that
of
martial
which
one
knows
not
how
to

economy
in
our
affairs
has
the
same
effect
upon
our
fortunes
which
good
breeding
has
upon
our
conversations
there
is
a
pretending
behaviour
in
both
cases
which
instead
of
making
men
esteemed
renders
them
both
miserable
and
contemptible
we
had
yesterday
at
sir
roger
a
set
of
country
gentlemen
who
dined
with
him
and
after
dinner
the
glass
was
taken
by
those
who
pleased
pretty
plentifully
among
others
i
observed
a
person
of
a
tolerable
good
aspect
who
seemed
to
be
more
greedy
of
liquor
than
any
of
the
company
and
yet
methought
he
did
not
taste
it
with
delight
as
he
grew
warm
he
was
suspicious
of
everything
that
was
said
and
as
he
advanced
towards
being
fuddled
his
humour
grew
worse
at
the
same
time
his
bitterness
seemed
to
be
rather
an
inward
dissatisfaction
in
his
own
mind
than
any
dislike
he
had
taken
to
the
company
upon
hearing
his
name
i
knew
him
to
be
a
gentleman
of
a
considerable
fortune
in
this
county
but
greatly
in
debt
what
gives
the
unhappy
man
this
peevishness
of
spirit
is
that
his
estate
is
dipped
and
is
eating
out
with
usury
and
yet
he
has
not
the
heart
to
sell
any
part
of
it
his
proud
stomach
at
the
cost
of
restless
nights
constant
inquietudes
danger
of
affronts
and
a
thousand
nameless
inconveniences
preserves
this
canker
in
his
fortune
rather
than
it
shall
be
said
he
is
a
man
of
fewer
hundreds
a
year
than
he
has
been
commonly
reputed
thus
he
endures
the
torment
of
poverty
to
avoid
the
name
of
being
less
rich
if
you
go
to
his
house
you
see
great
plenty
but
served
in
a
manner
that
shows
it
is
all
unnatural
and
that
the
mind
is
not
at
home
there
is
a
certain
waste
and
carelessness
in
the
air
of
everything
and
the
whole
appears
but
a
covered
indigence
a
magnificent
poverty
that
neatness
and
cheerfulness
which
attends
the
table
of
him
who
lives
within
compass
is
wanting
and
exchanged
for
a
libertine
way
of
service
in
all
about
him

not
frequently
used
in
this
sense

here
with
the
adjective

though
a
very
common
way
of
management
is
as
ridiculous
as
that
officer
would
be
who
had
but
few
men
under
his
command
and
should
take
the
charge
of
an
extent
of
country
rather
than
of
a
small
pass
to
pay
for
personate
and
keep
in
a
hands
a
greater
estate
than
he
really
has
is
of
all
others
the
most
unpardonable
vanity
and
must
in
the
end
reduce
the
man
who
is
guilty
of
it
to
dishonour
yet
if
we
look
round
us
in
any
county
of
great
britain
we
shall
see
many
in
this
fatal
error
if
that
may
be
called
by
so
soft
a
name
which
proceeds
from
a
false
shame
of
appearing
what
they
really
are

the
contrary
behavior
would
in
a
short
time
advance
them
to
the
condition
which
they
pretend
to
represent
keep
up
the
appearance
of
owning
laertes
has
fifteen
hundred
pounds
a
year
which
is
mortgaged
for
six
thousand
pounds
but
it
is
impossible
to
convince
him
that
if
he
sold
as
much
as
would
pay
off
that
debt
he
would
save
four
shillings
in
the
pound
which
he
gives
for
the
vanity
of
being
the
reputed
master
of
it
yet
if
laertes
did
this
he
would
perhaps
be
easier
in
his
own
fortune
but
then
irus
a
fellow
of
yesterday
who
has
but
twelve
hundred
a
year
would
be
his
equal
rather
than
this
shall
be
laertes
goes

every
twelvemonth
charges
his

one

birth
of

laertes
and
irus
are
neighbours
whose
way
of
living
are
an
abomination
to
each
other
irus
is
moved
by
the
fear
of
poverty
and
laertes
by
the
shame
of
it
though
the
motive
of
action
is
of
so
near
affinity
in
both
and
may
be
resolved
into
this
that
to
each
of
them
poverty
is
the
greatest
of
all
evils
yet
are
their
manners
very
widely
different
shame
of
poverty
makes
laertes
launch
into
unnecessary
equipage
vain
expense
and
lavish
entertainments
fear
of
poverty
makes
irus
allow
himself
only
plain
necessaries
appear
without
a
servant
sell
his
own
corn
attend
his
labourers
and
be
himself
a
labourer
shame
of
poverty
makes
laertes
go
every
day
a
step
nearer
to
it
and
fear
of
poverty
stirs
up
irus
to
make
every
day
some
further
progress
from
it
correct
the
english
these
different
motives
produce
the
excesses
which
men
are
guilty
of
in
the
negligence
of
and
provision
for
themselves
usury
extortion
and
oppression
have
their
seed
in
the
dread
of
want
and
vanity
riot
and
prodigality
from
the
shame
of
it
but
both
these
excesses
are
infinitely
below
the
pursuit
of
a
reasonable
creature
after
we
have
taken
care
to
command
so
much
as
is
necessary
for
maintaining
ourselves
in
the
order
of
men
suitable
to
our
character
the
care
of
superfluities
is
a
vice
no
less
extravagant
than
the
neglect
of
necessaries
would
have
been
before
in
what
sense
here
used
certain
it
is
that
they
are
both
out
of
nature
when
she
is
followed
with
reason
and
good
sense
it
is
from
this
reflection
that
i
always
read
cowley
with
the
greatest
pleasure
his
magnanimity
is
as
much
above
that
of
other
considerable
men
as
his
understanding
and
it
is
a
true
distinguishing
spirit
in
the
elegant
author
who
published
his
works
to
dwell
so
much
upon
the
temper
of
his
mind
and
the
moderation
of
his
desires
by
this
means
he
has
rendered
his
friend
as
amiable
as
famous
that
state
of
life
which
bears
the
face
of
poverty
with
cowley
great
vulgar
is
admirably
described
and
it
is
no
small
satisfaction
to
those
of
the
same
turn
of
desire
that
he
produces
the
authority
of
the
wisest
men
of
the
best
age
of
the
world
to
strengthen
his
opinion
of
the
ordinary
pursuits
of
mankind
at
variance
with
can
you
so
paraphrase
this
sentence
as
to
bring
any
clear
meaning
out
of
it
it
would
methinks
be
no
ill
maxim
of
life
if
according
to
that
ancestor
of
sir
roger
whom
i
lately
mentioned
every
man
would
point
to
himself
what
sum
he
would
resolve
not
to
exceed
he
might
by
this
means
cheat
himself
into
a
tranquillity
on
this
side
of
that
expectation
or
convert
what
he
should
get
above
it
to
nobler
uses
than
his
own
pleasures
or
necessities
this
temper
of
mind
would
exempt
a
man
from
an
ignorant
envy
of
restless
men
above
him
and
a
more
inexcusable
contempt
of
happy
men
below
him
this
would
be
sailing
by
some
compass
living
with
some
design
but
to
be
eternally
bewildered
in
prospects

it

that
the

may
have
created
in
me
this
way
of

which
is

as
i

i
find
no
inclination
so
strong
as
to
continue

so
remote
from
the
ostentatious

of

bodily
labour
is
of
two
kinds
either
that
which
a
man
submits
to
for
his
livelihood
or
that
which
he
undergoes
for
his
pleasure
the
latter
of
them
generally
changes
the
name
of
labour
for
that
of
exercise
but
differs
only
from
ordinary
labour
as
it
rises
from
another
motive
a
country
life
abounds
in
both
these
kinds
of
labour
and
for
that
reason
gives
a
man
a
greater
stock
of
health
and
consequently
a
more
perfect
enjoyment
of
himself
than
any
other
way
of
life
i
consider
the
body
as
a
system
of
tubes
and
glands
or
to
use
a
more
rustic
phrase
a
bundle
of
pipes
and
strainers
fitted
to
one
another
after
so
wonderful
a
manner
as
to
make
a
proper
engine
for
the
soul
to
work
with
this
description
does
not
only
comprehend
the
bowels
bones
tendons
veins
nerves
and
arteries
but
every
muscle
and
every
ligature
which
is
a
composition
of
fibres
that
are
so
many
imperceptible
tubes
or
pipes
interwoven
on
all
sides
with
invisible
glands
or
strainers
this
general
idea
of
a
human
body
without
considering
it
in
its
niceties
of
anatomy
lets
us
see
how
absolutely
necessary
labour
is
for
the
right
preservation
of
it
there
must
be
frequent
motions
and
agitations
to
mix
digest
and
separate
the
juices
contained
in
it
as
well
as
to
clear
and
cleanse
that
infinitude
of
pipes
and
strainers
of
which
it
is
composed
and
to
give
their
solid
parts
a
more
firm
and
lasting
tone
labour
or
exercise
ferments
the
humours
casts
them
into
their
proper
channels
throws
off
redundancies
and
helps
nature
in
those
secret
distributions
without
which
the
body
can
not
subsist
in
its
vigour
nor
the
soul
act
with
cheerfulness
i
might
here
mention
the
effects
which
this
has
upon
all
the
faculties
of
the
mind
by
keeping
the
understanding
clear
the
imagination
untroubled
and
refining
those
spirits
that
are
necessary
for
the
proper
exertion
of
our
intellectual
faculties
during
the
present
laws
of
union
between
soul
and
body
it
is
to
a
neglect
in
this
particular
that
we
must
ascribe
the
spleen
which
is
so
frequent
in
men
of
studious
and
sedentary
tempers
as
well
as
the
vapours
to
which
those
of
the
other
sex
are
so
often
subject
had
not
exercise
been
absolutely
necessary
for
our
nature
would
not
have
made
the
body
so
proper
for
it
by
giving
such
an
activity
to
the
limbs
and
such
a
pliancy
to
every
part
as
necessarily
produce
those
compressions
extensions
contortions
dilatations
and
all
other
kinds
of
motions
that
are
necessary
for
the
preservation
of
such
a
system
of
tubes
and
glands
as
has
been
before
mentioned
and
that
we
might
not
want
inducements
to
engage
us
in
such
an
exercise
of
the
body
as
is
proper
for
its
welfare
it
is
so
ordered
that
nothing
valuable
can
be
procured
without
it
not
to
mention
riches
and
honour
even
food
and
raiment
are
not
to
be
come
at
without
the
toil
of
the
hands
and
sweat
of
the
brows
providence
furnishes
materials
but
expects
that
we
should
work
them
up
ourselves
the
earth
must
be
laboured
before
it
gives
its
increase
and
when
it
is
forced
into
its
several
products
how
many
hands
must
they
pass
through
before
they
are
fit
for
use
manufactures
trade
and
agriculture
naturally
employ
more
than
nineteen
parts
of
the
species
in
twenty
and
as
for
those
who
are
not
obliged
to
labour
by
the
condition
in
which
they
are
born
they
are
more
miserable
than
the
rest
of
mankind
unless
they
indulge
themselves
in
that
voluntary
labour
which
goes
by
the
name
of
exercise
my
friend
sir
roger
has
been
an
indefatigable
man
in
business
of
this
kind
and
has
hung
several
parts
of
his
house
with
the
trophies
of
his
former
labours
the
walls
of
his
great
hall
are
covered
with
the
horns
of
several
kinds
of
deer
that
he
has
killed
in
the
chase
which
he
thinks
the
most
valuable
furniture
of
his
house
as
they
afford
him
frequent
topics
of
discourse
and
show
that
he
has
not
been
idle
at
the
lower
end
of
the
hall
is
a
large
otter
skin
stuffed
with
hay
which
his
mother
ordered
to
be
hung
up
in
that
manner
and
the
knight
looks
upon
it
with
great
satisfaction
because
it
seems
he
was
but
nine
years
old
when
his
dog
killed
him
a
little
room
adjoining
to
the
hall
is
a
kind
of
arsenal
filled
with
guns
of
several
sizes
and
inventions
with
which
the
knight
has
made
great
havoc
in
the
woods
and
destroyed
many
thousands
of
pheasants
partridges
and
woodcocks
his
stable
doors
are
patched
with
noses
that
belonged
to
foxes
of
the
knight
own
hunting
down
sir
roger
showed
me
one
of
them
that
for
distinction
sake
has
a
brass
nail
struck
through
it
which
cost
him
about
fifteen
hours
riding
carried
him
through
half
a
dozen
counties
killed
him
a
brace
of
geldings
and
lost
above
half
his
dogs
this
the
knight
looks
upon
as
one
of
the
greatest
exploits
of
his
life
the
perverse
widow
whom
i
have
given
some
account
of
was
the
death
of
several
foxes
for
sir
roger
has
told
me
that
in
the
course
of
his
amours
he
patched
the
western
door
of
his
stable
whenever
the
widow
was
cruel
the
foxes
were
sure
to
pay
for
it
in
proportion
as
his
passion
for
the
widow
abated
and
old
age
came
on
he
left
off
but
a
hare
is
not
yet
safe
that
sits
within
ten
miles
of
his
house
the
otter
or
sir
roger
recast
the
sentence
there
is
no
kind
of
exercise
which
i
would
so
recommend
to
my
readers
of
both
sexes
as
this
of
riding
as
there
is
none
which
so
much
conduces
to
health
and
is
every
way
accommodated
to
the
body
according
to
the
idea
which
i
have
given
of
it
sydenham
is
very
lavish
in
its
praises
and
if
the
english
reader
will
see
the
mechanical
effects
of
it
described
at
length
he
may
find
them
in
a
book
published
not
many
years
since
under
the
title
of
the
for
my
own
part
when
i
am
in
town
for
want
of
these
opportunities
i
exercise
myself
an
hour
every
morning
upon
a
that
is
placed
in
a
corner
of
my
room
and
pleases
me
the
more
because
it
does
everything
i
require
of
it
in
the
most
profound
silence
my
landlady
and
her
daughters
are
so
well
acquainted
with
my
hours
of
exercise
that
they
never
come
into
my
room
to
disturb
me
whilst
i
am
ringing
when
i
was
some
years
younger
than
i
am
at
present
i
used
to
employ
myself
in
a
more
laborious
diversion
which
i
learned
from
a
latin
treatise
of
exercises
that
is
written
with
great
erudition
it
is
there
called
the
greek
skiomachia
or
the
fighting
with
a
man
own
shadow
and
consists
in
the
brandishing
of
two
short
sticks
grasped
in
each
hand
and
loaden
with
plugs
of
lead
at
either
end
this
opens
the
chest
exercises
the
limbs
and
gives
a
man
all
the
pleasure
of
boxing
without
the
blows
i
could
wish
that
several
learned
men
would
lay
out
that
time
which
they
employ
in
controversies
and
disputes
about
nothing
in
this
method
of
fighting
with
their
own
shadows
it
might
conduce
very
much
to
evaporate
the
spleen
which
makes
them
uneasy
to
the
public
as
well
as
to
themselves
disagreeable
to
conclude
as
i
am
a
compound
of
soul
and
body
i
consider
myself
as
obliged
to
a
double
scheme
of
duties
and
think
i
have
not
fulfilled
the
business
of
the
day
when
i
do
not
thus
employ
the
one
in
labour
and
exercise
as
well
as
the
other
in
study
and
contemplation

those
who
have
searched
into
human
nature
observe
that
nothing
so
much
shows
the
nobleness
of
the
soul
as
that
its
felicity
consists
in
action
every
man
has
such
an
active
principle
in
him
that
he
will
find
out
something
to
employ
himself
upon
in
whatever
place
or
state
of
life
he
is
posted
i
have
heard
of
a
gentleman
who
was
under
close
confinement
in
the
bastile
seven
years
during
which
time
he
amused
himself
in
scattering
a
few
small
pins
about
his
chamber
gathering
them
up
again
and
placing
them
in
different
figures
on
the
arm
of
a
great
chair
he
often
told
his
friends
afterwards
that
unless
he
had
found
out
this
piece
of
exercise
he
verily
believed
he
should
have
lost
his
senses
after
what
has
been
said
i
need
not
inform
my
readers
that
sir
roger
with
whose
character
i
hope
they
are
at
present
pretty
well
acquainted
has
in
his
youth
gone
through
the
whole
course
of
those
rural
diversions
which
the
country
abounds
in
and
which
seem
to
be
extremely
well
suited
to
that
laborious
industry
a
man
may
observe
here
in
a
far
greater
degree
than
in
towns
and
cities
i
have
before
hinted
at
some
of
my
friend
exploits
he
has
in
his
youthful
days
taken
forty
coveys
of
partridges
in
a
season
and
tired
many
a
salmon
with
a
line
consisting
but
of
a
single
hair
the
constant
thanks
and
good
wishes
of
the
neighbourhood
always
attended
him
on
account
of
his
remarkable
enmity
towards
foxes
having
destroyed
more
of
those
vermin
in
one
year
than
it
was
thought
the
whole
country
could
have
produced
indeed
the
knight
does
not
scruple
to
own
among
his
most
intimate
friends
that
in
order
to
establish
his
reputation
this
way
he
has
secretly
sent
for
great
numbers
of
them
out
of
other
counties
which
he
used
to
turn
loose
about
the
country
by
night
that
he
might
the
better
signalize
himself
in
their
destruction
the
next
day
his
hunting
horses
were
the
finest
and
best
managed
in
all
these
parts
his
tenants
are
still
full
of
the
praises
of
a
gray
that
unhappily
staked
himself
several
years
since
and
was

solemnity

for
to
keep
himself
in

has
disposed
of
his

and
got
a
pack
of
what
these
want
in

he
endeavours
to
make
amends
for
by
the
deepness
of
their
mouths
and
the
variety
of
their
notes
which
are
suited
in
such
manner
to

that
the

makes
up
a

he
is
so
nice
in
this
particular
that
a
gentleman
having
made
him
a
present
of
a
very
fine
hound
the
other
day
the
knight
returned
it
by
the
servant
with
a
great
many
expressions
of
civility
but
desired
him
to
tell
his
master
that
the
dog
he
had
sent
was
indeed
a
most
excellent
bass
but
that
at
present
he
only
wanted
a

my

i
should
certainly
conclude
he
had
taken
the
hint
from

trained
to
stop
at

word
as
they
are
said
to
have
done

sir
roger
is
so
keen
at
this
sport
that
he
has
been
out
almost
every
day
since
i
came
down
and
upon
the
offering
to
lend
me
his
easy
pad
i
was
prevailed
on
yesterday
morning
to
make
one
of
the
company
i
was
extremely
pleased
as
we
rid
along
to
observe
the
general
benevolence
of
all
the
neighbourhood
towards
my
friend
the
farmers
sons
thought
themselves
happy
if
they
could
open
a
gate
for
the
good
old
knight
as
he
passed
by
which
he
generally
requited
with
a
nod
or
a
smile
and
a
kind
inquiry
after
their
fathers
and
uncles
after
we
had
rid
about
a
mile
from
home
we
came
upon
a
large
heath
and
the
sportsmen
began
to
beat
they
had
done
so
for
some
time
when
as
i
was
at
a
little
distance
from
the
rest
of
the
company
i
saw
a
hare
pop
out
from
a
small
almost
under
my
horse
feet
i
marked
the
way
she
took
which
i
endeavoured
to
make
the
company
sensible
of
by
extending
my
arm
but
to
no
purpose
till
sir
roger
who
knows
that
none
of
my
extraordinary
motions
are
insignificant
rode
up
to
me
and
asked
me
if
puss
was
gone
that
way
upon
my
answering
yes
he
immediately
called
in
the
dogs
and
put
them
upon
the
scent
as
they
were
going
off
i
heard
one
of
the
country
fellows
muttering
to
his
companion
that
was
a
wonder
they
had
not
lost
all
their
sport
for
want
of
the
silent
gentleman
crying
stole
away
to
beat
the
bushes
or
undergrowth
in
order
to
rouse
any
game
hidden
there
this
with
my
aversion
to
leaping
hedges
made
me
withdraw
to
a
rising
ground
from
whence
i
could
have
the
pleasure
of
the
whole
chase
without
the
fatigue
of
keeping
in
with
the
hounds
the
hare
immediately
threw
them
above
a
mile
behind
her
but
i
was
pleased
to
find
that
instead
of
running
straight
forwards
or
in
language
flying
the
country
as
i
was
afraid
she
might
have
done
she
wheeled
about
and
described
a
sort
of
circle
round
the
hill
where
i
had
taken
my
station
in
such
manner
as
gave
me
a
very
distinct
view
of
the
sport
i
could
see
her
first
pass
by
and
the
dogs
some
time
afterwards
unravelling
the
whole
track
she
had
made
and
following
her
through
all
her
doubles
i
was
at
the
same
time
delighted
in
observing
that
deference
which
the
rest
of
the
pack
paid
to
each
particular
hound
according
to
the
character
he
had
acquired
amongst
them
if
they
were
at
fault
and
an
old
hound
of
reputation
opened
but
once
he
was
immediately
followed
by
the
whole
cry
while
a
raw
dog
or
one
who
was
a
noted
liar
might
have
yelped
his
heart
out
without
being
taken
notice
of
what
bayed
the
hare
now
after
having
squatted
two
or
three
times
and
been
put
up
again
as
often
came
still
nearer
to
the
place
where
she
was
at
first
started
the
dogs
pursued
her
and
these
were
followed
by
the
jolly
knight
who
rode
upon
a
white
gelding
encompassed
by
his
tenants
and
servants
and
cheering
his
hounds
with
all
the
gaiety
of
one
of
the
sportsmen
rode
up
to
me
and
told
me
that
he
was
sure
the
chase
was
almost
at
an
end
because
the
old
dogs
which
had
hitherto
lain
behind
now
headed
the
pack
the
fellow
was
in
the
right
our
hare
took
a
large
field
just
under
us
followed
by
the
full
cry
in
view
i
must
confess
the
brightness
of
the
weather
the
cheerfulness
of
everything
around
me
the
chiding
of
the
hounds
which
was
returned
upon
us
in
a
double
echo
from
two
neighbouring
hills
with
the
hollowing
of
the
sportsmen
and
the
sounding
of
the
horn
lifted
my
spirits
into
a
most
lively
pleasure
which
i
freely
indulged
because
i
was
sure
it
was
innocent
if
i
was
under
any
concern
it
was
on
the
account
of
the
poor
hare
that
was
now
quite
spent
and
almost
within
the
reach
of
her
enemies
when
the
huntsman
getting
forward
threw
down
his
pole
before
the
dogs
they
were
now
within
eight
yards
of
that
game
which
they
had
been
pursuing
for
almost
as
many
hours
yet
on
the
signal
before
mentioned
they
all
made
a
sudden
stand
and
though
they
continued
opening
as
much
as
before
durst
not
once
attempt
to
pass
beyond
the
pole
at
the
same
time
sir
roger
rode
forward
and
alighting
took
up
the
hare
in
his
arms
which
he
soon
after
delivered
up
to
one
of
his
servants
with
an
order
if
she
could
be
kept
alive
to
let
her
go
in
his
great
orchard
where
it
seems
he
has
several
of
these
prisoners
of
war
who
live
together
in
a
very
comfortable
captivity
i
was
highly
pleased
to
see
the
discipline
of
the
pack
and
the
of
the
knight
who
could
not
find
in
his
heart
to
murder
a
creature
that
had
given
him
so
much
diversion
as
we
were
returning
home
i
remembered
that
monsieur
pascal
in
his
most
excellent
discourse
on
the
of
tells
us
that
all
our
endeavours
after
greatness
proceed
from
nothing
but
a
desire
of
being
surrounded
by
a
multitude
of
persons
and
affairs
that
may
hinder
us
from
looking
into
ourselves
which
is
a
view
we
can
not
bear
he
afterwards
goes
on
to
show
that
our
love
of
sports
comes
from
the
same
reason
and
is
particularly
severe
upon
hunting
what
says
he
unless
it
be
to
drown
thought
can
make
men
throw
away
so
much
time
and
pains
upon
a
silly
animal
which
they
might
buy
cheaper
in
the
market
the
foregoing
reflection
is
certainly
just
when
a
man
suffers
his
whole
mind
to
be
drawn
into
his
sports
and
altogether
loses
himself
in
the
woods
but
does
not
affect
those
who
propose
a
far
more
laudable
end
from
this
exercise
i
mean
the
preservation
of
health
and
keeping
all
the
organs
of
the
soul
in
a
condition
to
execute
her
orders
had
that
incomparable
person
whom
i
last
quoted
been
a
little
more
indulgent
to
himself
in
this
point
the
world
might
probably
have
enjoyed
him
much
longer
whereas
through
too
great
an
application
to
his
studies
in
his
youth
he
contracted
that
ill
habit
of
body
which
after
a
tedious
sickness
carried
him
off
in
the
fortieth
year
of
his
age
and
the
whole
history
we
have
of
his
life
till
that
time
is
but
one
continued
account
of
the
behaviour
of
a
noble
soul
struggling
under
innumerable
pains
and
distempers
for
my
own
part
i
intend
to
hunt
twice
a
week
during
my
stay
with
sir
roger
and
shall
prescribe
the
moderate
use
of
this
exercise
to
all
my
country
friends
as
the
best
kind
of
physic
for
mending
a
bad
constitution
and
preserving
a
good
one
i
can
not
do
this
better

there
are
some
opinions
in
which
a
man
should
stand
neuter
without
engaging
his
assent
to
one
side
or
the
other
such
a
hovering
faith
as
this
which
refuses
to
settle
upon
any
determination
is
absolutely
necessary
in
a
mind
that
is
careful
to
avoid
errors
and
prepossessions
when
the
arguments
press
equally
on
both
sides
in
matters
that
are
indifferent
to
us
the
safest
method
is
to
give
up
ourselves
to
neither
neutral
it
is
with
this
temper
of
mind
that
i
consider
the
subject
of
witchcraft
when
i
hear
the
relations
that
are
made
from
all
parts
of
the
world
not
only
from
norway
and
lapland
from
the
east
and
west
indies
but
from
every
particular
nation
in
europe
i
can
not
forbear
thinking
that
there
is
such
an
intercourse
and
commerce
with
evil
spirits
as
that
which
we
express
by
the
name
of
witchcraft
but
when
i
consider
that
the
ignorant
and
credulous
parts
of
the
world
abound
most
in
these
relations
and
that
the
persons
among
us
who
are
supposed
to
engage
in
such
an
infernal
commerce
are
people
of
a
weak
understanding
and
a
crazed
imagination
and
at
the
same
time
reflect
upon
the
many
impostures
and
delusions
of
this
nature
that
have
been
detected
in
all
ages
i
endeavour
to
suspend
my
belief
till
i
hear
more
certain
accounts
than
any
which
have
yet
come
to
my
knowledge
in
short
when
i
consider
the
question
whether
there
are
such
persons
in
the
world
as
those
we
call
witches
my
mind
is
divided
between
the
two
opposite
opinions
or
rather
to
speak
my
thoughts
freely
i
believe
in
general
that
there
is
and
has
been
such
a
thing
as
witchcraft
but
at
the
same
time
can
give
no
credit
to
any
particular
instance
of
it
i
am
engaged
in
this
speculation
by
some
occurrences
that
i
met
with
yesterday
which
i
shall
give
my
reader
an
account
of
at
large
as
i
was
walking
with
my
friend
sir
roger
by
the
side
of
one
of
his
woods
an
old
woman
applied
herself
to
me
for
my
charity
her
dress
and
figure
put
me
in
mind
of
the
following
description
in
otway
in
a
close
lane
as
i
pursued
my
journey
i
spied
a
wrinkled
hag
with
age
grown
double
picking
dry
sticks
and
mumbling
to
herself
her
eyes
with
scalding
rheum
were
gall
and
red
cold
palsy
shook
her
head
her
hands
seem
wither
and
on
her
crooked
shoulders
had
she
wrapp
the
tatter
remnants
of
an
old
striped
hanging
which
served
to
keep
her
carcase
from
the
cold
so
there
was
nothing
of
a
piece
about
her
her
lower
weeds
were
all
coarsely
with
colour
rags
black
red
white
yellow
and
seem
to
speak
variety
of
wretchedness
garments
as
i
was
musing
on
this
description
and
comparing
it
with
the
object
before
me
the
knight
told
me
that
this
very
old
woman
had
the
reputation
of
a
witch
all
over
the
country
that
her
lips
were
observed
to
be
always
in
motion
and
that
there
was
not
a
switch
about
her
house
which
her
neighbours
did
not
believe
had
carried
her
several
hundreds
of
miles
if
she
chanced
to
stumble
they
always
found
sticks
or
straws
that
lay
in
the
figure
of
a
cross
before
her
if
she
made
any
mistake
at
church
and
cried
amen
in
a
wrong
place
they
never
failed
to
conclude
that
she
was
saying
her
prayers
backwards
there
was
not
a
maid
in
the
parish
that
would
take
a
pin
of
her
though
she
should
offer
a
bag
of
money
with
it
she
goes
by
the
name
of
moll
white
and
has
made
the
country
ring
with
several
imaginary
exploits
which
are
palmed
upon
her
if
the
dairy
maid
does
not
make
her
butter
come
so
soon
as
she
should
have
it
moll
white
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
churn
if
a
horse
sweats
in
the
stable
moll
white
has
been
upon
his
back
if
a
hare
makes
an
unexpected
escape
from
the
hounds
the
huntsman
curses
moll
white
nay
says
sir
roger
i
have
known
the
master
of
the
pack
upon
such
an
occasion
send
one
of
his
servants
to
see
if
moll
white
had
been
out
that
morning
this
account
raised
my
curiosity
so
far
that
i
begged
my
friend
sir
roger
to
go
with
me
into
her
hovel
which
stood
in
a
solitary
corner
under
the
side
of
the
wood
upon
our
first
entering
sir
roger
winked
to
me
and
pointed
at
something
that
stood
behind
the
door
which
upon
looking
that
way
i
found
to
be
an
old
broomstaff
at
the
same
time
he
whispered
me
in
the
ear
to
take
notice
of
a
tabby
cat
that
sat
in
the
which
as
the
old
knight
told
me
lay
under
as
bad
a
report
as
moll
white
herself
for
besides
that
moll
is
said
often
to
accompany
her
in
the
same
shape
the
cat
is
reported
to
have
spoken
twice
or
thrice
in
her
life
and
to
have
played
several
pranks
above
the
capacity
of
an
ordinary
cat
i
was
secretly
concerned
to
see
human
nature
in
so
much
wretchedness
and
disgrace
but
at
the
same
time
could
not
forbear
smiling
to
hear
sir
roger
who
is
a
little
puzzled
about
the
old
woman
advising
her
as
a
justice
of
peace
to
avoid
all
communication
with
the
devil
and
never
to
hurt
any
of
her
neighbours
cattle
we
concluded
our
visit
with
a
bounty
which
was
very
acceptable
in
our
return
home
sir
roger
told
me
that
old
moll
had
been
often
brought
before
him
for
making
children
spit
pins
and
giving
maids
the
nightmare
and
that
the
country
people
would
be
tossing
her
into
a
pond
and
trying
experiments
with
her
every
day
if
it
was
not
for
him
and
his
chaplain
i
have
since
found
upon
inquiry
that
sir
roger
was
several
times
staggered
with
the
reports
that
had
been
brought
him
concerning
this
old
woman
and
would
frequently
have
bound
her
over
to
the
county
sessions
had
not
his
chaplain
with
much
ado
persuaded
him
to
the
contrary
i
have
been
the
more
particular
in
this
account
because
i
hear
there
is
scarce
a
village
in
england
that
has
not
a
moll
white
in
it
when
an
old
woman
begins
to
dote
and
grow
chargeable
to
a
parish
she
is
generally
turned
into
a
witch
and
fills
the
whole
country
with
extravagant
fancies
imaginary
distempers
and
terrifying
dreams
in
the
mean
time
the
poor
wretch
that
is
the
innocent
occasion
of
so
many
evils
begins
to
be
frighted
at
herself
and
sometimes
confesses
secret
commerce
and
familiarities
that
her
imagination
forms
in
a
delirious
old
age
this
frequently
cuts
off
charity
from
the
greatest
objects
of
compassion
and
inspires
people
with
a
malevolence
towards
those
poor
decrepit
parts
of
our
species
in
whom
human
nature
is
defaced
by
infirmity
and
dotage

this
agreeable
seat
is
surrounded
with
so
many
pleasing
walks
which
are
struck
out
of
a
wood
in
the
midst
of
which
the
house
stands
that
one
can
hardly
ever
be
weary
of
rambling
from
one
labyrinth
of
delight
to
another
to
one
used
to
live
in
a
city
the
charms
of
the
country
are
so
exquisite
that
the
mind
is
lost
in
a
certain
transport
which
raises
us
above
ordinary
life
and
yet
is
not
strong
enough
to
be
inconsistent
with
tranquillity
this
state
of
mind
was
i
in
ravished
with
the
murmur
of
waters
the
whisper
of
breezes
the
singing
of
birds
and
whether
i
looked
up
to
the
heavens
down
on
the
earth
or
turned
on
the
prospects
around
me
still
struck
with
new
sense
of
pleasure
when
i
found
by
the
voice
of
my
friend
who
walked
by
me
that
we
had
insensibly
strolled
into
the
grove
sacred
to
the
widow
this
woman
says
he
is
of
all
others
the
most
unintelligible
she
either
designs
to
marry
or
she
does
not
what
is
the
most
perplexing
of
all
is
that
she
doth
not
either
say
to
her
lovers
she
has
any
resolution
against
that
condition
of
life
in
general
or
that
she
banishes
them
but
conscious
of
her
own
merit
she
permits
their
addresses
without
fear
of
any
ill
consequence
or
want
of
respect
from
their
rage
or
despair
she
has
that
in
her
aspect
against
which
it
is
impossible
to
offend
a
man
whose
thoughts
are
constantly
bent
upon
so
agreeable
an
object
must
be
excused
if
the
ordinary
occurrences
in
conversation
are
below
his
attention
i
call
her
indeed
perverse
but
alas
why
do
i
call
her
so
because
her
superior
merit
is
such
that
i
can
not
approach
her
without
awe
that
my
heart
is
checked
by
too
much
esteem
i
am
angry
that
her
charms
are
not
more
accessible
that
i
am
more
inclined
to
worship
than
salute
her
how
often
have
i
wished
her
unhappy
that
i
might
have
an
opportunity
of
serving
her
and
how
often
troubled
in
that
very
imagination
at
giving
her
the
pain
of
being
obliged
well
i
have
led
a
miserable
life
in
secret
upon
her
account
but
fancy
she
would
have
condescended
to
have
some
regard
for
me
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
watchful
animal
her
confidante
of
all
persons
under
the
sun
continued
he
calling
me
by
name
be
sure
to
set
a
mark
upon
confidantes
they
are
of
all
people
the
most
impertinent
what
is
most
pleasant
to
observe
in
them
is
that
they
assume
to
themselves
the
merit
of
the
persons
whom
they
have
in
their
custody
orestilla
is
a
great
fortune
and
in
wonderful
danger
of
surprises
therefore
full
of
suspicions
of
the
least
indifferent
thing
particularly
careful
of
new
acquaintance
and
of
growing
too
familiar
with
the
old
themista
her
favourite
woman
is
every
whit
as
careful
of
whom
she
speaks
to
and
what
she
says
let
the
ward
be
a
beauty
her
confidante
shall
treat
you
with
an
air
of
distance
let
her
be
a
fortune
and
she
assumes
the
suspicious
behaviour
of
her
friend
and
patroness
thus
it
is
that
very
many
of
our
unmarried
women
of
distinction
are
to
all
intents
and
purposes
married
except
the
consideration
of
different
sexes
they
are
directly
under
the
conduct
of
their
whisperer
and
think
they
are
in
a
state
of
freedom
while
they
can
prate
with
one
of
these
attendants
of
all
men
in
general
and
still
avoid
the
man
they
most
like
you
do
not
see
one
heiress
in
a
hundred
whose
fate
does
not
turn
upon
this
circumstance
of
choosing
a
confidante
thus
it
is
that
the
lady
is
addressed
to
presented
and
flattered
only
by
proxy

heard

speaking

importunately

repeating

words
what
not

smile
we
followed
the
sound
till
we
came
to

close
thicket
on

side

saw

it

mention
of
her
unfortunate
william
whom
she
is
angry
with
but
alas
when
she
pleases
to
be
gone
thou
wilt
also
vanish
yet
let
me
talk
to
thee
while
thou
dost
stay
tell
my
dearest
betty
thou
dost
not
more
depend
upon
her
than
does
her
william
her
absence
will
make
away
with
me
as
well
as
thee
if
she
offers
to
remove
thee
i
jump
into
these
waves
to
lay
hold
on
thee
her
herself
her
own
dear
person
i
must
never
embrace
again
still
do
you
hear
me
without
one
smile
it
is
too
much
to
bear
he
had
no
sooner
spoke
these
words
but
he
made
an
offer
of
throwing
himself
into
the
water
at
which
his
mistress
started
up
and
at
the
next
instant
he
jumped
across
the
fountain
and
met
her
in
an
embrace
she
half
recovering
from
her
fright
said
in
the
most
charming
voice
imaginable
and
with
a
tone
of
complaint
i
thought
how
well
you
would
drown
yourself
no
no
you
wo
drown
yourself
till
you
have
taken
your
leave
of
susan
holliday
the
huntsman
with
a
tenderness
that
spoke
the
most
passionate
love
and
with
his
cheek
close
to
hers
whispered
the
softest
vows
of
fidelity
in
her
ear
and
cried
do
my
dear
believe
a
word
kate
willow
says
she
is
spiteful
and
makes
stories
because
she
loves
to
hear
me
talk
to
herself
for
your
sake
assumed
notice
how
this
meaning
comes
directly
from
the
etymology
of
the
word
look
you
there
quoth
sir
roger
do
you
see
there
all
mischief
comes
from
confidantes
but
let
us
not
interrupt
them
the
maid
is
honest
and
the
man
dare
not
be
otherwise
for
he
knows
i
loved
her
father
i
will
interpose
in
this
matter
and
hasten
the
wedding
kate
willow
is
a
witty
mischievous
wench
in
the
neighborhood
who
was
a
beauty
and
makes
me
hope
i
shall
see
the
perverse
widow
in
her
condition
she
was
so
flippant
with
her
answers
to
all
the
honest
fellows
that
came
near
her
and
so
very
vain
of
her
beauty
that
she
has
valued
herself
upon
her
charms
till
they
are
ceased
she
therefore
now
makes
it
her
business
to
prevent
other
young
women
from
being
more
discreet
than
she
was
herself
however
the
saucy
thing
said
the
other
day
well
enough
roger
and
i
must
make
a
match
for
we
are
both
despised
by
those
we
loved
the
hussy
has
a
great
deal
of
power
wherever
she
comes
and
has
her
share
of
cunning
however
when
i
reflect
upon
this
woman
i
do
not
know
whether
in
the
main
i
am
the
worse
for
having
loved
her
whenever
she
is
recalled
to
my
imagination
my
youth
returns
and
i
feel
a
forgotten
warmth
in
my
veins
this
affliction
in
my
life
has
streaked
all
my
conduct
with
a
softness
of
which
i
should
otherwise
have
been
incapable
it
is
perhaps
to
this
dear
image
in
my
heart
owing
that
i
am
apt
to
relent
that
i
easily
forgive
and
that
many
desirable
things
are
grown
into
my
temper
which
i
should
not
have
arrived
at
by
better
motives
than
the
thought
of
being
one
day
hers
i
am
pretty
well
satisfied
such
a
passion
as
i
have
had
is
never
well
cured
and
between
you
and
me
i
am
often
apt
to
imagine
it
has
had
some
whimsical
effect
upon
my
brain
for
i
frequently
find
that
in
my
most
serious
discourse
i
let
fall
some
comical
familiarity
of
speech
or
odd
phrase
that
makes
the
company
laugh
however
i
can
not
but
allow
she
is
a
most
excellent
woman
when
she
is
in
the
country
i
warrant
she
does
not
run
into
dairies
but
reads
upon
the
nature
of
plants
but
has
a
glass
hive
and
comes
into
the
garden
out
of
books
to
see
them
work
and
observe
the
policies
of
their
commonwealth
she
understands
everything
i
give
ten
pounds
to
hear
her
argue
with
my
friend
sir
andrew
freeport
about
trade
no
no
for
all
she
looks
so
innocent
as
it
were
take
my
word
for
it
she
is
no
fool
the
widow
not
the
hussy
what
is
the
force
of
this
word
here
leaves
her
books
to
come
into
the
garden

the
first
and
most
obvious
reflections
which
arise
in
a
man
who
changes
the
city
for
the
country
are
upon
the
different
manners
of
the
people
whom
he
meets
with
in
those
two
different
scenes
of
life
by
manners
i
do
not
mean
morals
but
behaviour
and
good
breeding
as
they
show
themselves
in
the
town
and
in
the
country
and
here
in
the
first
place
i
must
observe
a
very
great
revolution
that
has
happened
in
this
article
of
good
breeding
several
obliging
deferences
condescensions
and
submissions
with
many
outward
forms
and
ceremonies
that
accompany
them
were
first
of
all
brought
up
among
the
politer
part
of
mankind
who
lived
in
courts
and
cities
and
distinguished
themselves
from
the
rustic
part
of
the
species
who
on
all
occasions
acted
bluntly
and
naturally
by
such
a
mutual
complaisance
and
intercourse
of
civilities
these
forms
of
conversation
by
degrees
multiplied
and
grew
troublesome
the
modish
world
found
too
great
a
constraint
in
them
and
have
therefore
thrown
most
of
them
aside
conversation
like
the
romish
religion
was
so
encumbered
with
show
and
ceremony
that
it
stood
in
need
of
a
reformation
to
retrench
its
superfluities
and
restore
it
to
its
natural
good
sense
and
beauty
at
present
therefore
an
unconstrained
carriage
and
a
certain
openness
of
behavior
are
the
height
of
good
breeding
the
fashionable
world
is
grown
free
and
easy
our
manners
sit
more
loose
upon
us
nothing
is
so
modish
as
an
agreeable
negligence
in
a
word
good
breeding
shows
itself
most
where
to
an
ordinary
eye
it
appears
the
least
various
social
intercourse
fashionable
if
after
this
we
look
on
the
people
of
mode
in
the
country
we
find
in
them
the
manners
of
the
last
age
they
have
no
sooner
fetched
themselves
up
to
the
fashion
of
the
polite
world
but
the
town
has
dropped
them
and
are
nearer
to
the
first
stage
of
nature
than
to
those
refinements
which
formerly
reigned
in
the
court
and
still
prevail
in
the
country
one
may
now
know
a
man
that
never
conversed
in
the
world
by
his
excess
of
good
breeding
a
polite
country
squire
shall
make
you
as
many
bows
in
half
an
hour
as
would
serve
a
courtier
for
a
week
there
is
infinitely
more
to
do
about
place
and
precedency
in
a
meeting
of
justices
wives
than
in
an
assembly
of
duchesses
the
fashions
not
the
people
in
the
country
the
subject
is
town
this
rural
politeness
is
very
troublesome
to
a
man
of
my
temper
who
generally
take
the
chair
that
is
next
me
and
walk
first
or
last
in
the
front
or
in
the
rear
as
chance
directs
i
have
known
my
friend
sir
dinner
almost
cold
before
the
company
could
adjust
the
ceremonial
and
be
prevailed
upon
to
sit
down
and
have
heartily
pitied
my
old
friend
when
i
have
seen
him
forced
to
pick
and
cull
his
guests
as
they
sat
at
the
several
parts
of
his
table
that
he
might
drink
their
healths
according
to
their
respective
ranks
and
qualities
honest
will
wimble
who
i
should
have
thought
had
been
altogether
uninfected
with
ceremony
gives
me
abundance
of
trouble
in
this
particular
though
he
has
been
fishing
all
the
morning
he
will
not
help
himself
at
dinner
till
i
am
served
when
we
are
going
out
of
the
hall
he
runs
behind
me
and
last
night
as
we
were
walking
in
the
fields
stopped
short
at
a
stile
till
i
came
up
to
it
and
upon
my
making
signs
to
him
to
get
over
told
me
with
a
serious
smile
that
sure
i
believed
they
had
no
manners
in
the
country
there
has
happened
another
revolution
in
the
point
of
good
breeding
which
relates
to
the
conversation
among
men
of
mode
and
which
i
can
not
but
look
upon
as
very
extraordinary
it
was
certainly
one
of
the
first
distinctions
of
a
man
to
express
everything
that
had
the
most
remote
appearance
of
being
obscene
in
modest
terms
and
distant
phrases
whilst
the
clown
who
had
no
such
delicacy
of
conception
and
expression
clothed
his
ideas
in
most
plain
homely
terms
that
are
the
most
obvious
and
natural
this
kind
of
good
manners
was
perhaps
carried
to
an
excess
so
as
to
make
conversation
too
stiff
formal
and
precise
for
which
reason
as
hypocrisy
in
one
age
is
generally
succeeded
by
atheism
in
another
conversation
is
in
a
great
measure
relapsed
into
the
first
extreme
so
that
at
present
several
of
our
men
of
the
town
and
particularly
those
who
have
been
polished
in
france
make
use
of
the
most
coarse
uncivilized
words
in
our
language
and
utter
themselves
often
in
such
a
manner
as
a
clown
would
blush
to
hear
this
infamous
piece
of
good
breeding
which
reigns
among
the
coxcombs
of
the
town
has
not
yet
made
its
way
into
the
country
and
as
it
is
impossible
for
such
an
irrational
way
of
conversation
to
last
long
among
a
people
that
make
any
profession
of
religion
or
show
of
modesty
if
the
country
gentlemen
get
into
it
they
will
certainly
be
left
in
the
lurch
their
good
breeding
will
come
too
late
to
them
and
they
will
be
thought
a
parcel
of
lewd
clowns
while
they
fancy
themselves
talking
together
like
men
of
wit
and
pleasure
as
the
two
points
of
good
breeding
which
i
have
hitherto
insisted
upon
regard
behaviour
and
conversation
there
is
a
third
which
turns
upon
dress
in
this
too
the
country
are
very
much
behindhand
the
rural
beaus
are
not
yet
got
out
of
the
fashion
that
took
place
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
but
ride
about
the
country
in
red
coats
and
laced
hats
while
the
women
in
many
parts
are
still
trying
to
outvie
one
another
in
the
height
of
their
is
but
a
friend
of
mine
who
is
now
upon
the
western
circuit
having
promised
to
give
me
an
account
of
the
several
modes
and
fashions
that
prevail
in
the
different
parts
of
the
nation
through
which
he
passes
i
shall
defer
the
enlarging
upon
this
last
topic
till
i
have
received
a
letter
from
him
which
i
expect
every
post

a

first
care
should
be
to
avoid
the
reproaches
of
his
own
heart
his
next
to
escape
the
censures
of
the
world
if
the
last
interferes
with
the
former
it
ought
to
be
entirely
neglected
but
otherwise
there
can
not
be
a
greater
satisfaction
to
an
honest
mind
than
to
see
those
approbations
which
it
gives
itself
seconded
by
the
applauses
of
the
public
a
man
is
more
sure
of
his
conduct
when
the
verdict
which
he
passes
upon
his
own
behaviour
is
thus
warranted
and
confirmed
by
the
opinion
of
all
that
know
him
my
worthy
friend
sir
roger
is
one
of
those
who
is
not
only
at
peace
within
himself
but
beloved
and
esteemed
by
all
about
him
he
receives
a
suitable
tribute
for
his
universal
benevolence
to
mankind
in
the
returns
of
affection
and
which
are
paid
him
by
every
one
that
lives
within
his
neighbourhood
i
lately
met
with
two
or
three
odd
instances
of
that
general
respect
which
is
shown
to
the
good
old
knight
he
would
needs
carry
will
wimble
and
myself
with
him
to
the
county
assizes
as
we
were
upon
the
road
will
wimble
joined
a
couple
of
plain
men
who
rid
before
us
and
conversed
with
them
for
some
time
during
which
my
friend
sir
roger
acquainted
me
with
their
characters
the
first
of
them
says
he
that
has
a
spaniel
by
his
side
is
a
yeoman
of
about
an
hundred
pounds
a
year
an
honest
man
he
is
just
within
the
game
act
and
qualified
to
kill
an
hare
or
a
pheasant
he
knocks
down
a
dinner
with
his
gun
twice
or
thrice
a
week
and
by
that
means
lives
much
cheaper
than
those
who
have
not
so
good
an
estate
as
himself
he
would
be
a
good
neighbour
if
he
did
not
destroy
so
many
partridges
in
short
he
is
a
very
sensible
man
shoots
flying
and
has
been
several
times
foreman
of
the
petty
jury
shoots
birds
on
the
wing
the
other
that
rides
along
with
him
is
tom
touchy
a
fellow
famous
for
taking
the
law
of
everybody
there
is
not
one
in
the
town
where
he
lives
that
he
has
not
sued
at
a
quarter
sessions
the
rogue
had
once
the
impudence
to
go
to
law
with
the
widow
his
head
is
full
of
costs
damages
and
ejectments
he
plagued
a
couple
of
honest
gentlemen
so
long
for
a
trespass
in
breaking
one
of
his
hedges
till
he
was
forced
to
sell
the
ground
it
enclosed
to
defray
the
charges
of
the
prosecution
his
father
left
him
fourscore
pounds
a
year
but
he
has
cast
and
been
cast
so
often
that
he
is
not
now
worth
thirty
i
suppose
he
is
going
upon
the
old
business
of
the
willow
tree
modern
idiom
demands
that
won
and
lost
his
case
as
sir
roger
was
giving
me
this
account
of
tom
touchy
will
wimble
and
his
two
companions
stopped
short
till
we
came
up
to
them
after
having
paid
their
respects
to
sir
roger
will
told
him
that
mr
touchy
and
he
must
appeal
to
him
upon
a
dispute
that
arose
between
them
will
it
seems
had
been
giving
his
an
account
of
his
angling
one
day
in
such
a
hole
when
tom
touchy
instead
of
hearing
out
his
story
told
him
that
if
he
pleased
might
take
the
law
of
him
for
fishing
in
that
part
of
the
river
my
friend
sir
roger
heard
them
both
upon
a
round
trot
and
after
having
paused
some
time
told
them
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
would
not
give
his
judgment
rashly
that
much
might
be
said
on
both
sides
they
were
neither
of
them
dissatisfied
with
the
knight
determination
because
neither
of
them
found
himself
in
the
wrong
by
it
upon
which
we
made
the
best
of
our
way
to
the
assizes
the
court
was
sat
before
sir
roger
came
but
notwithstanding
all
the
justices
had
taken
their
places
upon
the
bench
they
made
room
for
the
old
knight
at
the
head
of
them
who
for
his
reputation
in
the
country
took
occasion
to
whisper
in
the
judge
ear
that
he
was
glad
his
lordship
had
met
with
so
much
good
weather
in
his
circuit
i
was
listening
to
the
proceeding
of
the
court
with
much
attention
and
infinitely
pleased
with
that
great
appearance
and
solemnity
which
so
properly
accompanies
such
a
public
administration
of
our
laws
when
after
about
an
hour
sitting
i
observed
to
my
great
surprise
in
the
midst
of
a
trial
that
my
friend
sir
roger
was
getting
up
to
speak
i
was
in
some
pain
for
him
till
i
found
he
had
acquitted
himself
of
two
or
three
sentences
with
a
look
of
much
business
and
great
intrepidity
upon
his
first
rising
the
court
was
hushed
and
a
general
whisper
ran
among
the
country
people
that
sir
roger
was
up
the
speech
he
made
was
so
little
to
the
purpose
that
i
shall
not
trouble
my
readers
with
an
account
of
it
and
i
believe
was
not
so
much
designed
by
the
knight
himself
to
inform
the
court
as
to
give
him
a
figure
in
my
eye
and
keep
up
his
credit
in
the
country
i
was
highly
delighted
when
the
court
rose
to
see
the
gentlemen
of
the
country
gathering
about
my
old
friend
and
striving
who
should
compliment
him
most
at
the
same
time
that
the
ordinary
people
gazed
upon
him
at
a
distance
not
a
little
admiring
his
courage
that
was
not
afraid
to
speak
to
the
judge
in
our
return
home
we
met
with
a
very
odd
accident
which
i
can
not
forbear
relating
because
it
shows
how
desirous
all
who
know
sir
roger
are
of
giving
him
marks
of
their
esteem
when
we
arrived
upon
the
verge
of
his
estate
we
stopped
at
a
little
inn
to
rest
ourselves
and
our
horses
the
man
of
the
house
had
it
seems
been
formerly
a
servant
in
the
knight
family
and
to
do
honour
to
his
old
master
had
some
time
since
unknown
to
sir
roger
put
him
up
in
a
before
the
door
so
that
the
knight
head
had
hung
out
upon
the
road
about
a
week
before
he
himself
knew
anything
of
the
matter
as
soon
as
sir
roger
was
acquainted
with
it
finding
that
his
servant
indiscretion
proceeded
wholly
from
affection
and
he
only
told
him
that
he
had
made
him
too
high
a
compliment
and
when
the
fellow
seemed
to
think
that
could
hardly
be
added
with
a
more
decisive
look
that
it
was
too
great
an
honour
for
any
man
under
a
duke
but
told
him
at
the
same
time
that
it
might
be
altered
with
a
very
few
touches
and
that
he
himself
would
be
at
the
charge
of
it
accordingly
they
got
a
painter
by
the
knight
directions
to
add
a
pair
of
whiskers
to
the
face
and
by
a
little
aggravation
of
the
features
to
change
it
into
the
saracen
head
i
should
not
have
known
this
story
had
not
the
innkeeper
upon
sir
roger
alighting
told
him
in
my
hearing
that
his
honour
head
was
brought
back
last
night
with
the
alterations
that
he
had
ordered
to
be
made
in
it
upon
this
my
friend
with
his
usual
cheerfulness
related
the
particulars
above
mentioned
and
ordered
the
head
to
be
brought
into
the
room
i
could
not
forbear
discovering
greater
expressions
of
mirth
than
ordinary
upon
the
appearance
of
this
monstrous
face
under
which
notwithstanding
it
was
made
to
frown
and
stare
in
a
most
extraordinary
manner
i
could
still
discover
a
distant
resemblance
of
my
old
friend
sir
roger
upon
seeing
me
laugh
desired
me
to
tell
him
truly
if
i
thought
it
possible
for
people
to
know
him
in
that
disguise
i
at
first
kept
my
usual
silence
but
upon
the
knight
conjuring
me
to
tell
him
whether
it
was
not
still
more
like
himself
than
a
saracen
i
composed
my
countenance
in
the
best
manner
i
could
and
replied
that
much
might
be
said
on
both
sides
note
the
two
different
senses
in
which
this
word
is
used
these
several
adventures
with
the
knight
behaviour
in
them
gave
me
as
pleasant
a
day
as
ever
i

as
i
was
yesterday
taking
the
air
with
my
friend
sir
roger
we
were
met
by
a
ruddy
young
man
who
rid
by
us
full
speed
with
a
couple
of
servants
behind
him
upon
my
inquiry
who
he
was
sir
roger
told
me
that
he
was
a
young
gentleman
of
a
considerable
estate
who
had
been
educated
by
a
tender
mother
that
lives
not
many
miles
from
the
place
where
we
were
she
is
a
very
good
lady
says
my
friend
but
took
so
much
care
of
her
son
health
that
she
has
made
him
good
for
nothing
she
quickly
found
that
reading
was
bad
for
his
eyes
and
that
writing
made
his
head
ache
he
was
let
loose
among
the
woods
as
soon
as
he
was
able
to
ride
on
or
to
carry
a
gun
upon
his
shoulder
to
be
brief
i
found
by
my
friend
account
of
him
that
he
had
got
a
great
stock
of
health
but
nothing
else
and
that
if
it
were
a
man
business
only
to
live
there
would
not
be
a
more
accomplished
young
fellow
in
the
whole
country
the
truth
of
it
is
since
my
residing
in
these
parts
i
have
seen
and
heard
innumerable
instances
of
young
heirs
and
elder
brothers
who
either
from
their
own
reflecting
upon
the
estates
they
are
born
to
and
therefore
thinking
all
other
accomplishments
unnecessary
or
from
hearing
these
notions
frequently
inculcated
to
them
by
the
flattery
of
their
servants
and
domestics
or
from
the
same
foolish
thought
prevailing
in
those
who
have
the
care
of
their
education
are
of
no
manner
of
use
but
to
keep
up
their
families
and
transmit
their
lands
and
houses
in
a
line
to
posterity
this
makes
me
often
think
on
a
story
i
have
heard
of
two
friends
which
i
shall
give
my
reader
at
large
under
feigned
names
the
moral
of
it
may
i
hope
be
useful
though
there
are
some
circumstances
which
make
it
rather
appear
like
a
novel
than
a
true
story
eudoxus
and
leontine
began
the
world
with
small
estates
they
were
both
of
them
men
of
good
sense
and
great
virtue
they
prosecuted
their
studies
together
in
their
earlier
years
and
entered
into
such
a
friendship
as
lasted
to
the
end
of
their
lives
eudoxus
at
his
first
setting
out
in
the
world
threw
himself
into
a
court
where
by
his
natural
endowments
and
his
acquired
abilities
he
made
his
way
from
one
post
to
another
till
at
length
he
had
raised
a
very
considerable
fortune
leontine
on
the
contrary
sought
all
opportunities
of
improving
his
mind
by
study
conversation
and
travel
he
was
not
only
acquainted
with
all
the
sciences
but
with
the
most
eminent
professors
of
them
throughout
europe
he
knew
perfectly
well
the
interests
of
its
princes
with
the
customs
and
fashions
of
their
courts
and
could
scarce
meet
with
the
name
of
an
extraordinary
person
in
the
whom
he
had
not
either
talked
to
or
seen
in
short
he
had
so
well
mixed
and
digested
his
knowledge
of
men
and
books
that
he
made
one
of
the
most
accomplished
persons
of
his
age
during
the
whole
course
of
his
studies
and
travels
he
kept
up
a
punctual
correspondence
with
eudoxus
who
often
made
himself
acceptable
to
the
principal
men
about
court
by
the
intelligence
which
he
received
from
leontine
when
they
were
both
turned
of
forty
an
age
in
which
according
to
cowley
there
is
no
dallying
with
life
they
determined
pursuant
to
the
resolution
they
had
taken
in
the
beginning
of
their
lives
to
retire
and
pass
the
remainder
of
their
days
in
the
country
in
order
to
this
they
both
of
them
married
much
about
the
same
time
leontine
with
his
own
and
his
wife
fortune
bought
a
farm
of
three
hundred
a
year
which
lay
within
the
neighbourhood
of
his
friend
eudoxus
who
had
purchased
an
estate
of
as
many
thousands
they
were
both
of
them
fathers
about
the
same
time
eudoxus
having
a
son
born
to
him
and
leontine
a
daughter
but
to
the
unspeakable
grief
of
the
latter
his
young
wife
in
whom
all
his
happiness
was
wrapt
up
died
in
a
few
days
after
the
birth
of
her
daughter
his
affliction
would
have
been
insupportable
had
not
he
been
comforted
by
the
daily
visits
and
conversations
of
his
friend
as
they
were
one
day
talking
together
with
their
usual
intimacy
leontine
considering
how
incapable
he
was
of
giving
his
daughter
a
proper
education
in
his
own
house
and
eudoxus
reflecting
on
the
ordinary
behaviour
of
a
son
who
knows
himself
to
be
the
heir
of
a
great
estate
they
both
agreed
upon
an
exchange
of
children
namely
that
the
boy
should
be
bred
up
with
leontine
as
his
son
and
that
the
girl
should
live
with
eudoxus
as
his
daughter
till
they
were
each
of
them
arrived
at
years
of
discretion
the
wife
of
eudoxus
knowing
that
her
son
could
not
be
so
advantageously
brought
up
as
under
the
care
of
leontine
and
considering
at
the
same
time
that
he
would
be
perpetually
under
her
own
eye
was
by
degrees
prevailed
upon
to
fall
in
with
the
project
she
therefore
took
leonilla
for
that
was
the
name
of
the
girl
and
educated
her
as
her
own
daughter
the
two
friends
on
each
side
had
wrought
themselves
to
such
an
habitual
tenderness
for
the
children
who
were
under
their
direction
that
each
of
them
had
the
real
passion
of
a
father
where
the
title
was
but
imaginary
florio
the
name
of
the
young
heir
that
lived
with
leontine
though
he
had
all
the
duty
and
affection
imaginable
for
his
supposed
parent
was
taught
to
rejoice
at
the
sight
of
eudoxus
who
visited
his
friend
very
frequently
and
was
dictated
by
his
natural
affection
as
well
as
by
the
rules
of
prudence
to
make
himself
esteemed
and
beloved
by
florio
the
boy
was
now
old
enough
to
know
his
supposed
father
circumstances
and
that
therefore
he
was
to
make
his
way
in
the
world
by
his
own
industry
this
consideration
grew
stronger
in
him
every
day
and
produced
so
good
an
effect
that
he
applied
himself
with
more
than
ordinary
attention
to
the
pursuit
of
everything
which
leontine
recommended
to
him
his
natural
abilities
which
were
very
good
assisted
by
the
directions
of
so
excellent
a
counsellor
enabled
him
to
make
a
quicker
progress
than
ordinary
through
all
the
parts
of
his
education
before
he
was
twenty
years
of
age
having
finished
his
studies
and
exercises
with
great
applause
he
was
removed
from
the
university
to
the
inns
of
court
where
there
are
very
few
that
make
themselves
considerable
proficients
in
the
studies
of
the
place
who
know
they
shall
arrive
at
great
estates
without
them
this
was
not
florio
case
he
found
that
three
hundred
a
year
was
but
a
poor
estate
for
leontine
and
himself
to
live
upon
so
that
he
studied
without
intermission
till
he
gained
a
very
good
insight
into
the
constitution
and
laws
of
his
country
improve
the
arrangement
i
should
have
told
my
reader
that
whilst
florio
lived
at
the
house
of
his
he
was
always
an
acceptable
guest
in
the
family
of
eudoxus
where
he
became
acquainted
with
leonilla
from
her
infancy
his
acquaintance
with
her
by
degrees
grew
into
love
which
in
a
mind
trained
up
in
all
the
sentiments
of
honour
and
virtue
became
a
very
uneasy
passion
he
despaired
of
gaining
an
heiress
of
so
great
a
fortune
and
would
rather
have
died
than
attempted
it
by
any
indirect
methods
leonilla
who
was
a
woman
of
the
greatest
beauty
joined
with
the
greatest
modesty
entertained
at
the
same
time
a
secret
passion
for
florio
but
conducted
herself
with
so
much
prudence
that
she
never
gave
him
the
least
intimation
of
it
florio
was
now
engaged
in
all
those
arts
and
improvements
that
are
proper
to
raise
a
man
private
fortune
and
give
him
a
figure
in
his
country
but
secretly
tormented
with
that
passion
which
burns
with
the
greatest
fury
in
a
virtuous
and
noble
heart
when
he
received
a
sudden
summons
from
leontine
to
repair
to
him
into
the
country
the
next
day
for
it
seems
eudoxus
was
so
filled
with
the
report
of
his
son
reputation
that
he
could
no
longer
withhold
making
himself
known
to
him
the
morning
after
his
arrival
at
the
house
of
his
supposed
father
leontine
told
him
that
eudoxus
had
something
of
great
importance
to
communicate
to
him
upon
which
the
good
man
embraced
him
and
wept
florio
was
no
sooner
arrived
at
the
great
house
that
stood
in
his
neighbourhood
but
eudoxus
took
him
by
the
hand
after
the
first
salutes
were
over
and
conducted
him
into
his
closet
he
there
opened
to
him
the
whole
secret
of
his
parentage
and
education
concluding
after
this
manner
i
have
no
other
way
left
of
acknowledging
my
gratitude
to
leontine
than
by
marrying
you
to
his
daughter
he
shall
not
lose
the
pleasure
of
being
your
father
by
the
discovery
i
have
made
to
you
leonilla
too
shall
be
still
my
daughter
her
filial
piety
though
misplaced
has
been
so
exemplary
that
it
deserves
the
greatest
reward
i
can
confer
upon
it
you
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
a
great
estate
fall
to
you
which
you
would
have
lost
the
relish
of
had
you
known
yourself
born
to
it
continue
only
to
deserve
it
in
the
same
manner
you
did
before
you
were
possessed
of
it
i
have
left
your
mother
in
the
next
room
her
heart
yearns
towards
you
she
is
making
the
same
discoveries
to
leonilla
which
i
have
made
to
yourself
florio
was
so
overwhelmed
with
this
profusion
of
happiness
that
he
was
not
able
to
make
a
reply
but
threw
himself
down
at
his
father
feet
and
amidst
a
flood
of
tears
kissed
and
embraced
his
knees
asking
his
blessing
and
expressing
in
dumb
show
those
sentiments
of
love
duty
and
gratitude
that
were
too
big
for
utterance
to
conclude
the
happy
pair
were
married
and
half

settled
upon
them
leontine
and
eudoxus
passed
the
remainder
of
their
lives
together
and
received
in
the
dutiful
and
affectionate
behaviour
of
florio

leonilla
the
just
recompense
as

as

my
worthy
friend
sir
roger
when
we
are
talking
of
the
malice
of
parties
very
frequently
tells
us
an
accident
that
happened
to
him
when
he
was
a
schoolboy
which
was
at
a
time
when
the
feuds
ran
high
between
the
roundheads
and
cavaliers
this
worthy
knight
being
then
but
a
stripling
had
occasion
to
inquire
which
was
the
way
to
lane
upon
which
the
person
whom
he
spoke
to
instead
of
answering
his
question
called
him
a
young
popish
cur
and
asked
him
who
had
made
anne
a
saint
the
boy
being
in
some
confusion
inquired
of
the
next
he
met
which
was
the
way
to
anne
lane
but
was
called
a
cur
for
his
pains
and
instead
of
being
shown
the
way
was
told
that
she
had
been
a
saint
before
he
was
born
and
would
be
one
after
he
was
hanged
upon
this
says
sir
roger
i
did
not
think
fit
to
repeat
the
former
question
but
going
into
every
lane
of
the
neighbourhood
asked
what
they
called
the
name
of
that
lane
by
which
ingenious
artifice
he
found
out
the
place
he
inquired
after
without
giving
offence
to
any
party
sir
roger
generally
closes
this
narrative
with
reflections
on
the
mischief
that
parties
do
in
the
country
how
they
spoil
good
neighbourhood
and
make
honest
gentlemen
hate
one
another
besides
that
they
manifestly
tend
to
the
prejudice
of
the
and
the
destruction
of
the
game
there
can
not
a
greater
judgment
befall
a
country
than
such
a
dreadful
spirit
of
division
as
rends
a
government
into
two
distinct
people
and
makes
them
greater
strangers
and
more
averse
to
one
another
than
if
they
were
actually
two
different
nations
the
effects
of
such
a
division
are
pernicious
to
the
last
degree
not
only
with
regard
to
those
advantages
which
they
give
the
common
enemy
but
to
those
private
evils
which
they
produce
in
the
heart
of
almost
every
particular
person
this
influence
is
very
fatal
both
to
men
morals
and
their
understandings
it
sinks
the
virtue
of
a
nation
and
not
only
so
but
destroys
even
common
sense
a
furious
party
spirit
when
it
rages
in
its
full
violence
exerts
itself
in
civil
war
and
bloodshed
and
when
it
is
under
its
greatest
restraints
naturally
breaks
out
in
detraction
calumny
and
a
partial
administration
of
justice
in
a
word
it
fills
a
nation
with
spleen
and
rancour
and
extinguishes
all
the
seeds
of
compassion
and
humanity

that
a
man
should
not
allow
himself
to
hate
even
his
enemies
because
says
he
if
you
indulge
this
passion
in
some
occasions
it
will
rise
of
itself
in
others
if
you
hate
your
enemies
you
will
contract
such
a
vicious
habit
of
mind
as
by
degrees
will
break
out
upon
those
who
are
your
friends
or
those
who
are
indifferent
to
you
i
might
here
observe
how
admirably
this
precept
of
morality
which
derives
the
malignity
of
hatred
from
the
passion
itself
and
not
from
its
object
answers
to
that
great
rule
which
was
dictated
to
the
world
about
an
hundred
years
before
this
philosopher
wrote
but
instead
of
that
i
shall
only
take
notice
with
a
real
grief
of
heart
that
the
minds
of
many
good
men
among
us
appear
soured
with
party
principles
and
alienated
from
one
another
in
such
a
manner
as
seems
to
me
altogether
inconsistent
with
the
dictates
either
of
reason
or
religion
zeal
for
a
public
cause
is
apt
to
breed
passions
in
the
hearts
of
virtuous
persons
to
which
the
regard
of
their
own
private
interest
would
never
have
betrayed
them
if
this
party
spirit
has
so
ill
an
effect
on
our
morals
it
has
likewise
a
very
great
one
upon
our
judgements
we
often
hear
a
poor
insipid
paper
or
pamphlet
cried
up
and
sometimes
a
noble
piece
depreciated
by
those
who
are
of
a
different
principle
from
the
author
one
who
is
actuated
by
this
spirit
is
almost
under
an
incapacity
of
discerning
either
real
blemishes
or
beauties
a
man
of
merit
in
a
different
principle
is
like
an
object
seen
in
two
different
mediums
that
appears
crooked
or
broken
however
straight
or
entire
it
may
be
in
itself
for
this
reason
there
is
scarce
a
person
of
any
figure
in
england
who
does
not
go
by
two
contrary
characters
as
opposite
to
one
another
as
light
and
darkness
knowledge
and
learning
suffer
in
a
particular
manner
from
this
strange
prejudice
which
at
present
prevails
amongst
all
ranks
and
degrees
in
the
british
nation
as
men
formerly
became
eminent
in
learned
societies
by
their
parts
and
acquisitions
they
now
distinguish
themselves
by
the
warmth
and
violence
with
which
they
espouse
their
respective
parties
books
are
valued
upon
the
like
consideration
an
abusive
scurrilous
style
passes
for
satire
and
a
dull
scheme
of
party
notions
is
called
fine
writing
of
a
different
opinion
as
a
stick
partly
in
the
water
and
partly
out
there
is
one
piece
of
sophistry
practiced
by
both
sides
and
that
is
the
taking
any
scandalous
story
that
has
been
ever
whispered
or
invented
of
a
private
man
for
a
known
undoubted
truth
and
raising
suitable
speculations
upon
it
calumnies
that
have
been
never
proved
or
have
been
often
refuted
are
the
ordinary
of
these
infamous
scribblers
upon
which
they
proceed
as
upon
first
principles
granted
by
all
men
though
in
their
hearts
they
know
they
are
false
or
at
best
very
doubtful
when
they
have
laid
these
foundations
of
scurrility
it
is
no
wonder
that
their
superstructure
is
every
way
answerable
to
them
if
this
shameless
practice
of
the
present
age
endures
much
longer
praise
and
reproach
will
cease
to
be
motives
of
action
in
good
men

propositions

for

in

if
the
latin
form
is
used

plural
should
be
there
are
certain
periods
of
time
in
all
governments
when
this
inhuman
spirit
prevails
italy
was
long
torn
in
pieces
by
the
guelphs
and
ghibellines
and
france
by
those
who
were
for
and
against
the
league
but
it
is
very
unhappy
for
a
man
to
be
born
in
such
a
stormy
and
tempestuous
season
it
is
the
restless
ambition
of
artful
men
that
thus
breaks
a
people
into
factions
and
draws
several
persons
to
their
interest
by
a
specious
concern
for
their
country
how
many
honest
minds
are
filled
with
uncharitable
and
barbarous
notions
out
of
their
zeal
for
the
public
good
what
cruelties
and
outrages
would
they
not
commit
against
men
of
an
adverse
party
whom
they
would
honour
and
esteem
if
instead
of
considering
them
as
they
are
represented
they
knew
them
as
they
are
thus
are
persons
of
the
greatest
probity
seduced
into
shameful
errors
and
prejudices

made
bad
men

by
that
noblest
of
principles
the
love
of
their

i
can
not
here
forbear
mentioning
the
famous
spanish
proverb
if
there
were
neither
fools
nor
knaves
in
the
world
all
people
would
be
of
one
mind
for
my
own
part
i
could
heartily
wish
that
all
honest
men
would
enter
into
an
association
for
the
support
of
one
another
against
the
endeavours
of
those
whom
they
ought
to
look
upon
as
their
common
enemies
whatsoever
side
they
may
belong
to
were
there
such
an
honest
body
of
neutral
forces
we
should
never
see
the
worst
of
men
in
great
figures
of
life
because
they
are
useful
to
a
party
nor
the
best
unregarded
because
they
are
above
practising
those
methods
which
would
be
grateful
to
their
faction
we
should
then
single
every
criminal
out
of
the
herd
and
hunt
him
down
however
formidable
and
overgrown
he
might
appear
on
the
contrary
we
should
shelter
distressed
innocence
and
defend
virtue
however
beset
with
contempt
or
ridicule
envy
or
defamation
in
short
we
should
not
any
longer
regard
our
fellow
subjects
as
whigs

should
make

of

our

in

proposed
that
the
honest

of

should
enter
into
a
kind
of
association
for
the
defence
of
one
another
and
the

as
it
is
designed
this

should
act
with

nothing
but
truth
and
equity
and
divest
themselves
of
the
little
heats
and
prepossessions
that
cleave
to
parties
of
all
kinds
i
have
prepared
for
them
the
following
form
of
an
association
which
may
express
their
intentions
in
the
most
plain
and
simple
manner
we
whose
names
are
hereunto
subscribed
do
solemnly
declare
that
we
do
in
our
consciences
believe
two
and
two
make
four
and
that
we
shall
adjudge
any
man
whatsoever
to
be
our
enemy
who
endeavors
to
persuade
us
to
the
contrary
we
are
likewise
ready
to
maintain
with
the
hazard
of
all
that
is
near
and
dear
to
us
that
six
is
less
than
seven
in
all
times
and
all
places
and
that
ten
will
not
be
more
three
years
hence
than
it
is
at
present
we
do
also
firmly
declare
that
it
is
our
resolution
as
long
as
we
live
to
call
black
black
and
white
white
and
we
shall
upon
all
occasions
oppose
such
persons
that
upon
any
day
of
the
year
shall
call
black
white
or
white
black
with
the
utmost
peril
of
our
lives
and
fortunes
were
there
such
a
combination
of
honest
men
who
without
any
regard
to
places
would
endeavour
to
extirpate
all
such
furious
zealots
as
would
sacrifice
one
half
of
their
country
to
the
passion
and
interest
of
the
other
as
also
such
infamous
hypocrites
that
are
for
promoting
their
own
advantage
under
colour
of
the
public
good
with
all
the
profligate
immoral
retainers
to
each
side
that
have
nothing
to
recommend
them
but
an
implicit
submission
to
their
leaders
we
should
soon
see
that
furious
party
spirit
extinguished
which
may
in
time
expose
us
to
the
derision
and
contempt
of
all
the
nations
about
us
a
member
of
this
society
that
would
thus
carefully
employ
himself
in
making
room
for
merit
by
throwing
down
the
worthless
and
depraved
part
of
mankind
from
those
conspicuous
stations
of
life
to
which
they
have
been
sometimes
advanced
and
all
this
without
any
regard
to
his
private
interest
would
be
no
small
benefactor
to
his
country
i
remember
to
have
read
in
diodorus
siculus
an
account
of
a
very
active
little
animal
which
i
think
he
calls
the
ichneumon
that
makes
it
the
whole
business
of
his
life
to
break
the
eggs
of
the
crocodile
which
he
is
always
in
search
after
this
instinct
is
the
more
remarkable
because
the
ichneumon
never
feeds
upon
the
eggs
he
has
broken
nor
in
any
other
way
finds
his
account
in
them
were
it
not
for
the
incessant
labours
of
this
industrious
animal
egypt
says
the
historian
would
be
overrun
with
crocodiles
for
the
egyptians
are
so
far
from
destroying
those
pernicious
creatures
that
they
worship
them
as
gods
if
we
look
into
the
behaviour
of
ordinary
partisans
we
shall
find
them
far
from
resembling
this
disinterested
animal
and
rather
acting
after
the
example
of
the
wild
tartars
who
are
ambitious
of
destroying
a
man
of
the
most
extraordinary
parts
and
accomplishments
as
thinking
that
upon
his
decease
the
same
talents
whatever
post
they
qualified
him
for
enter
of
course
into
his
destroyer
as
in
the
whole
train
of
my
speculations
i
have
endeavoured
as
much
as
i
am
able
to
extinguish
that
pernicious
spirit
of
passion
and
prejudice
which
rages
with
the
same
violence
in
all
parties
i
am
still
the
more
desirous
of
doing
some
good
in
this
particular
because
i
observe
that
the
spirit
of
party
reigns
more
in
the
country
than
in
the
town
it
here
contracts
a
kind
of
brutality
and
rustic
fierceness
to
which
men
of
a
politer
conversation
are
wholly
strangers
it
extends
itself
even
to
the
return
of
the
bow
and
the
hat
and
at
the
same
time
that
the
heads
of
parties
preserve
toward
one
another
an
outward
show
of
good
breeding
and
keep
up
a
perpetual
intercourse
of
civilities
their
tools
that
are
dispersed
in
these
outlying
parts
will
not
so
much
as
mingle
together
at
a
this
humour
fills
the
country
with
several
periodical
meetings
of
whig
jockeys
and
tory
fox
hunters
not
to
mention
the
innumerable
curses
frowns
and
whispers
it
produces
at
a
quarter
sessions
i
do
not
know
whether
i
have
observed
in
any
of
my
former
papers
that
my
friends
sir
roger
de
coverley
and
sir
andrew
freeport
are
of
different
principles
the
first
of
them
inclined
to
the
landed
and
the
other
to
the
moneyed
interest
this
humour
is
so
moderate
in
each
of
them
that
it
proceeds
no
farther
than
to
an
agreeable
raillery
which
very
often
diverts
the
rest
of
the
club
i
find
however
that
the
knight
is
a
much
stronger
tory
in
the
country
than
in
town
which
as
he
has
told
me
in
my
ear
is
absolutely
necessary
for
the
keeping
up
his
interest
in
all
our
journey
from
london
to
his
house
we
did
not
so
much
as
bait
at
a
whig
inn
or
if
by
chance
the
coachman
stopped
at
a
wrong
place
one
of
sir
roger
servants
would
ride
up
to
his
master
full
speed
and
whisper
to
him
that
the
master
of
the
house
was
against
such
an
one
in
the
last
election
this
often
betrayed
us
into
hard
beds
and
bad
cheer
for
we
were
not
so
inquisitive
about
the
inn
as
the
innkeeper
and
provided
our
landlord
principles
were
sound
did
not
take
any
notice
of
the
staleness
of
his
provisions
this
i
found
still
the
more
inconvenient
because
the
better
the
host
was
the
worse
generally
were
his
accommodations
the
fellow
knowing
very
well
that
those
who
were
his
friends
would
take
up
with
coarse
diet
and
an
hard
lodging
for
these
reasons
all
the
while
i
was
upon
the
road
i
dreaded
entering
into
an
house
of
any
one
that
sir
roger
had
applauded
for
an
honest
man
since
my
stay
at
sir
roger
in
the
country
i
daily
find
more
instance
of
this
narrow
party
humour
being
upon
a
bowling
green
at
a
neighbouring
market
town
the
other
day
for
that
is
the
place
where
the
gentlemen
of
one
side
meet
once
a
week
i
observed
a
stranger
among
them
of
a
better
presence
and
genteeler
behaviour
than
ordinary
but
was
much
surprised
that
notwithstanding
he
was
a
very
fair
better
nobody
would
take
him
up
but
upon
inquiry
i
found
that
he
was
one
who
had
given
a
disagreeable
vote
in
a
former
parliament
for
which
reason
there
was
not
a
man
upon
that
bowling
green
who
would
have
so
much
correspondence
with
him
as
to
win
his
money
of
him
among
other
instances
of
this
nature
i
must
not
omit
one
which
concerns
myself
will
wimble
was
the
other
day
relating
several
strange
stories
that
he
had
picked
up
nobody
knows
where
of
a
certain
great
man
and
upon
my
staring
at
him
as
one
that
was
surprised
to
hear
such
things
in
the
country
which
had
never
been
so
much
as
whispered
in
the
town
will
stopped
short
in
the
thread
of
his
discourse
and
after
dinner
asked
my
friend
sir
roger
in
his
ear
if
he
was
sure
that
i
was
not
a
fanatic
it
gives
me
a
serious
concern
to
see
such
a
spirit
of
dissension
in
the
country
not
only
as
it
destroys
virtue
and
common
sense
and
renders
us
in
a
manner
barbarians
towards
one
another
but
as
it
perpetuates
our
animosities
widens
our
breaches
and
transmits
our
present
passions
and
prejudices
to
our
posterity
for
my
own
part
i
am
sometimes
afraid
that
i
discover
the
seeds
of
a
civil
war
in
these
our
divisions
and
therefore
can
not
but
bewail
as
in
their
first
principles
the
miseries
and
calamities
of

children

was

at

little
distance
from

a
troop
of
gipsies
upon
the
first
discovery
of

my
friend
was
in
some
doubt
whether
he
should
not
exert
the
justice
of
the
peace
upon
such
a
band
of
lawless
vagrants
but
not
having
his
clerk
with
him
who
is
a
necessary
counsellor
on
these
occasions
and
fearing
that
his
poultry
might
fare
the
worse
for
it
he
let
the
thought
drop
but
at
the
same
time
gave
me
a
particular
account
of
the
mischiefs
they
do
in
the
country
in
stealing
people
goods
and
spoiling
their
servants
if
a
stray
piece
of
linen
hangs
upon

says
sir

they
are
sure
to
have
it

a
hog
loses
his
way
in
the
fields
it
is
ten

but
he
becomes
their
prey
our

can
not

prosecutes
them

severity
his
is
sure
to
pay
for

they
generally
straggle
into
these
parts
about
this

of

set
the

of
our
so
agog
for
husbands
that
we
do
not
expect
to
have
any
business
done
as
it
should
be

who
crosses

never
fails
being
promised

young
fellow
in

your

has
been

he

every

himself

observing
that
i
listened
with
great
attention
to
his

told
me
that
i
loved
a
pretty
maid
in
a
corner
that
i
was
a
good
woman
man
with
some
other
particulars
which
i
do
not
think
proper
to
relate
my
friend
sir
roger
alighted
from
his
horse
and
exposing
his
palm
to
two
or
three
that
stood
by
him
they
crumpled
it
into
all
shapes
and
diligently
scanned
every
wrinkle
that
could
be
made
in
it
when
one
of
them
who
was
older
and
more
sunburnt
than
the
rest
told
him
that
he
had
a
widow
in
his
line
of
life
upon
which
the
knight
cried
go
go
you
are
an
idle
baggage
and
at
the
same
time
smiled
upon
me
the
gipsy
finding
he
was
not
displeased
in
his
heart
told
him
after
a
farther
inquiry
into
his
hand
that
his
true
love
was
constant
and
that
she
should
dream
of
him
my
old
friend
cried
pish
and
bid
her
go
on
the
gipsy
told
him
that
he
was
a
bachelor
but
would
not
be
so
long
and
that
he
was
dearer
to
somebody
than
he
thought
the
knight
still
repeated
she
was
an
idle
baggage
and
bid
her
go
on
ah
master
says
the
gipsy
that
roguish
leer
of
yours
makes
a
pretty
woman
heart
ache
you
that
simper
about
the
mouth
for
nothing
the
uncouth
gibberish
with
which
all
this
was
uttered
like
the
darkness
of
an
oracle
made
us
the
more
attentive
to
it
to
be
short
the
knight
left
the
money
with
her
that
he
had
crossed
her
hand
with
and
got
up
again
on
his
horse
the
lines
or
wrinkles
in
the
palm
of
the
hand
supposed
to
indicate
the
fortune
the
line
beginning
at
the
middle
of
the
wrist
and
sweeping
round
the
base
of
the
thumb
as
this
is
the
line
upon
which
are
based
predictions
as
to
length
of
life
and
not
as
to
marriage
relations
spectator
probably
did
not
report
the
gipsy
correctly
as
we
were
riding
away
sir
roger
told
me
that
he
knew
several
sensible
people
who
believed
these
gipsies
now
and
then
foretold
very
strange
things
and
for
half
an
hour
together
appeared
more
jocund
than
ordinary
in
the
height
of
his
good
humour
meeting
a
common
beggar
upon
the
road
who
was
no
conjurer
as
he
went
to
relieve
him
he
found
his
pocket
was
picked
that
being
a
kind
of
palmistry
at
which
this
race
of
vermin
are
very
dextrous
i
might
here
entertain
my
reader
with
historical
remarks
on
this
idle
profligate
people
who
infest
all
the
countries
of
europe
and
live
in
the
midst
of
governments
in
a
kind
of
commonwealth
by
themselves
but
instead
of
entering
into
observations
of
this
nature
i
shall
fill
the
remaining
part
of
my
paper
with
a
story
which
is
still
fresh
in
holland
and
was
printed
in
one
of
our
monthly
accounts
about
twenty
years
ago
as
the
or
hackney
boat
which
carries
passengers
from
leyden
to
amsterdam
was
putting
off
a
boy
running
along
the
side
of
the
canal
desired
to
be
taken
in
which
the
master
of
the
boat
refused
because
the
lad
had
not
quite
money
enough
to
pay
the
usual
fare
an
eminent
merchant
being
pleased
with
the
looks
of
the
boy
and
secretly
touched
with
compassion
towards
him
paid
the
money
for
him
and
ordered
him
to
be
taken
on
board
upon
talking
with
him
afterwards
he
found
that
he
could
speak
readily
in
three
or
four
languages
and
learned
upon
farther
examination
that
he
had
been
stolen
away
when
he
was
a
child
by
a
gypsy
and
had
rambled
ever
since
with
a
gang
of
those
strollers
up
and
down
several
parts
of
europe
it
happened
that
the
merchant
whose
heart
seems
to
have
inclined
towards
the
boy
by
a
secret
kind
of
instinct
had
himself
lost
a
child
some
years
before
the
parents
after
a
long
search
for
him
gave
him
for
drowned
in
one
of
the
canals
with
which
that
country
abounds
and
the
mother
was
so
afflicted
at
the
loss
of
a
fine
boy
who
was
her
only
son
that
she
died
for
grief
of
it
gave
him
up
for
drowned
upon
laying
together
all
particulars
and
examining
the
several
moles
and
marks
by
which
the
mother
used
to
describe
the
child
when
he
was
first
missing
the
boy
proved
to
be
the
son
of
the
merchant
whose
heart
had
so
unaccountably
melted
at
the
sight
of
him
the
lad
was
very
well
pleased
to
find
a
father
who
was
so
rich
and
likely
to
leave
him
a
good
estate
the
father
on
the
other
hand
was
not
a
little
delighted
to
see
a
son
return
to
him
whom
he
had
given
for
lost
with
such
a
strength
of
constitution
sharpness
of
understanding
and
skill
in
languages
here
the
printed
story
leaves
off
but
if
i
may
give
credit
to
reports
our
linguist
having
received
such
extraordinary
rudiments
towards
a
good
education
was
afterwards
trained
up
in
everything
that
becomes
a
gentleman
wearing
off
by
little
and
little
all
the
vicious
habits
and
practices
that
he
had
been
used
to
in
the
course
of
his
peregrinations
nay
it
is
said
that
he
has
since
been
employed
in
foreign
courts
upon
national
business
with
great
reputation
to
himself
and
honour
to
those
who
sent
him
and
that
he
has
visited
several
countries
as
a
public
minister
in
which
he
formerly
wandered

it
is
usual
for
a
man
who
loves
country
sports
to
preserve
the
game
in
his
own
grounds
and
divert
himself
upon
those
that
belong
to
his
neighbour
my
friend
sir
roger
generally
goes
two
or
three
miles
from
his
house
and
gets
into
the
frontiers
of
his
estate
before
he
beats
about
in
search
of
an
hare
or
partridge
on
purpose
to
spare
his
own
fields
where
he
is
always
sure
of
finding
diversion
when
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
by
this
means
the
breed
about
his
house
has
time
to
increase
and
multiply
besides
that
the
sport
is
the
more
agreeable
where
the
game
is
the
harder
to
come
at
and
does
not
lie
so
thick
as
to
produce
any
perplexity
or
confusion
in
the
pursuit
for
these
reasons
the
country
gentleman
like
the
fox
seldom
preys
near
his
own
home
in
the
same
manner
i
have
made
a
month
excursion
out
of
the
town
which
is
the
great
field
of
game
for
sportsmen
of
my
species
to
try
my
fortune
in
the
country
where
i
have
started
several
subjects
and
hunted
them
down
with
some
pleasure
to
myself
and
i
hope
to
others
i
am
here
forced
to
use
a
great
deal
of
diligence
before
i
can
spring
anything
to
my
mind
whereas
in
town
whilst
i
am
following
one
character
it
is
ten
to
one
but
i
am
crossed
in
my
way
by
another
and
put
up
such
a
variety
of
odd
creatures
in
both
sexes
that
they
foil
the
scent
of
one
another
and
puzzle
the
chase
my
greatest
difficulty
in
the
country
is
to
find
sport
and
in
town
to
choose
it
in
the
meantime
as
i
have
given
a
whole
month
rest
to
the
cities
of
london
and
westminster
i
promise
myself
abundance
of
new
game
upon
my
return
thither
it
is
indeed
high
time
for
me
to
leave
the
country
since
i
find
the
whole
neighbourhood
begin
to
grow
very
inquisitive
after
my
name
and
character
my
love
of
solitude
taciturnity
and
particular
way
of
life
having
raised
a
great
curiosity
in
all
these
parts
the
notions
which
have
been
framed
of
me
are
various
some
look
upon
me
as
very
proud
and
some
as
very
melancholy
will
wimble
as
my
friend
the
butler
tells
me
observing
me
very
much
alone
and
extremely
silent
when
i
am
in
company
is
afraid
i
have
killed
a
man
the
country
people
seem
to
suspect
me
for
a
conjurer
and
some
of
them
hearing
of
the
visit
which
i
made
to
moll
white
will
needs
have
it
that
sir
roger
has
brought
down
a
cunning
man
with
him
to
cure
the
old
woman
and
free
the
country
from
her
charms
so
that
the
character
which
i
go
under
in
part
of
the
neighbourhood
is
what
they
here
call
a
white
witch
a
justice
of
peace
who
lives
about
five
miles
off
and
is
not
of
sir
roger
party
has
it
seems
said
twice
or
thrice
at
his
table
that
he
wishes
sir
roger
does
not
harbor
a
jesuit
in
his
house
and
that
he
thinks
the
gentlemen
of
the
country
would
do
very
well
to
make
me
give
some
account
of
myself
on
the
other
side
some
of
sir
roger
friends
are
afraid
the
old
knight
is
imposed
upon
by
a
designing
fellow
and
as
they
have
heard
that
he
converses
very
promiscuously
when
he
is
in
town
do
not
know
but
he
has
brought
down
with
him
some
discarded
whig
that
is
sullen
and
says
nothing
because
he
is
out
of
place
such
is
the
variety
of
opinions
which
are
here
entertained
of
me
so
that
i
pass
among
some
for
a
disaffected
person
and
among
others
for
a
popish
priest
among
some
for
a
wizard
and
among
others
for
a
murderer
and
all
this
for
no
other
reason
that
i
can
imagine
but
because
i
do
not
hoot
and
hollow
and
make
a
noise
it
is
true
my
friend
sir
roger
tells
them
that
it
is
my
way
and
that
i
am
only
a
philosopher
but
that
will
not
satisfy
them
they
think
there
is
more
in
me
than
he
discovers
and
that
i
do
not
hold
my
tongue
for
nothing
for
these
and
other
reasons
i
shall
set
out
for
london
having
found
by
experience
that
the
country
is
not
a
place
for
a
person
of
my
temper
who
does
not
love
jollity
and
what
they
call
good
neighbourhood
a
man
that
is
out
of
humour
when
an
unexpected
guest
breaks
in
upon
him
and
does
not
care
for
sacrificing
an
afternoon
to
every
chance
comer
that
will
be
the
master
of
his
own
time
and
the
pursuer
of
his
own
inclinations
makes
but
a
very
unsociable
figure
in
this
kind
of
life
i
shall
therefore
retire
into
the
town
if
i
may
make
use
of
that
phrase
and
get
into
the
crowd
again
as
fast
as
i
can
in
order
to
be
alone
i
can
there
raise
what
speculations
i
please
upon
others
without
being
observed
myself
and
at
the
same
time
enjoy
all
the
advantages
of
company
with
all
the
privileges
of
solitude
in
the
meanwhile
to
finish
the
month
and
conclude
these
my
rural
speculations
i
shall
here
insert
a
letter
from
my
friend
will
honeycomb
who
has
not
lived
a
month
for
these
forty
years
out
of
the
smoke
of
london
and
rallies
me
after
his
way
upon
my
country

suppose
this
letter
will
find
thee
picking

or
smelling
to
a
lock

hay
or
passing
away
thy
time
in
some
innocent
country
diversion

i
have
however
orders
from

summon
thee

nor

hour
in

that
had

dumb
from
sir

de

i
observed
by
what
he
said
of
myself
that
according
to
his
office
he
dealt
much
in
intelligence
and
doubted
not
but
there
was
some
foundation
for
his
reports
of
the
rest
of
the
company
as
well
as
for
the
whimsical
account
he
gave
of
me

were
all
called

disputed
with
as
possible
dressed
immediately
that
i
might
make
no
one
wait
the
first
preparation
for

out
was
that

was
placed
near
the
coachman
and
a
drum
behind
the
coach
in
the
meantime
the
drummer
the
captain
equipage
was
very
loud
that
none
of
the
things
should
be
placed
so
as
to
be
spoiled
upon
which
his
cloak
bag
was
fixed
in
the
seat
of
the
coach
and
the
captain
himself
according
to
a
frequent
though
invidious
behaviour
of
military
men
ordered
his
man
to
look
sharp
that
none
but

of

should

of

box
under

seat
presuming
offensive
because
presuming
we
were
in
some
little
time
fixed
in
our
seats
and
sat
with
that
dislike
which
people
not
too
usually
conceive
of
each
other
at
first
sight
the
coach
jumbled
us
insensibly
into
some
sort
of
familiarity
and
we
had
not
moved
above
two
miles
when
the
widow
asked
the
captain
what
success
he
had
in
his
recruiting
the
officer
with
a
frankness
he
believed
very
graceful
told
her
that
indeed
he
had
but
very
little
luck
and
had
suffered
much
by
desertion
therefore
should
be
glad
to
end
his
warfare
in
the
service
of
her
or
her
fair
daughter

word

this
was
followed
by
a
vain
laugh
of
his
own
and
a
deep
silence
of
all
the
rest
of
the
company
i
had
nothing
left
for
it

to
fall
fast
asleep

friend
we

hired
this

with
thee
to

us
to

this

utter
thy

we

i
say
if
thou
wilt
we
must
hear
thee
but
if
thou
wert
a

of

thou
wouldst
not
take
advantage
of
thy
courageous
countenance
to
abash
us
children
of

thou
art
thou
sayest
a

give
quarter
to
us
who
can
not
resist
thee
why
didst
thou
fleer
at
our
friend
who
feigned
himself
asleep
he
said
nothing
but
how
dost
thou
know
what
he
containeth
if
thou
speakest
improper
things
in
the
hearing
of
this
virtuous
young
virgin
consider
it
is
an
outrage
against
a
distressed
person
that
can
not
get
from
thee
to
speak
indiscreetly
what
we
are
obliged
to
hear
by
being

ephraim
paused
and
the

with
an
happy
and
uncommon
impudence
which
can
be
convicted
and

itself

the

time
cries

friend
i
thank
thee
i
should
have
been
a
little
impertinent
if
thou
hadst
not
reprimanded
me
come
thou
art
i
see
a
smoky
old
fellow
and
i
be
very
orderly
the
ensuing
part
of
the
journey
i
was
going
to
give
myself
airs
but
ladies
i
beg
pardon
quizzical

to
smoke

the
captain
was
so
little
out
of
humour
and
our
company
was
so
far
from
being
soured
by
this
little
ruffle
that
ephraim
and
he
took
a
particular
delight
in
being
agreeable
to
each
other
for
the
future
and
assumed
their
different
provinces
in
the
conduct
of
the
company
our
reckonings
apartments
and
accommodation
fell
under
ephraim
and
the
captain
looked
to
all
disputes
on
the
road
as
the
good
behaviour
of
our
coachman
and
the
right
we
had
of
taking
place
as
going
to
london
of
all
vehicles
coming
from
thence
fell
under
the
charge
of
the
occurrences
we
met
with
were
ordinary
and
very
little
happened
which
could
entertain
by
the
relation
of
them
but
when
i
considered
the
company
we
were
in
i
took
it
for
no
small
good
fortune
that
the
whole
journey
was
not
spent
in
impertinences
which
to
one
part
of
us
might
be
an
entertainment
to
the
other
a
suffering
what
therefore
ephraim
said
when
we
were
almost
arrived
at
london
had
to
me
an
air
not
only
of
good
understanding
but
good
breeding
upon
the
young
lady
expressing
her
satisfaction
in
the
journey
and
declaring
how
delightful
it
had
been
to
her
ephraim
delivered
himself
as
follows
there
is
no
ordinary
part
of
human
life
which
expresseth
so
much
a
good
mind
and
a
right
inward
man
as
his
behaviour
upon
meeting
with
strangers
especially
such
as
may
seem
the
most
unsuitable
companions
to
him
such
a
man
when
he
falleth
in
the
way
with
persons
of
simplicity
and
innocence
however
knowing
he
may
be
in
the
ways
of
men
will
not
vaunt
himself
thereof
but
will
the
rather
hide
his
superiority
to
them
that
he
may
not
be
painful
unto
them
my
good
friend
continued
he
turning
to
the
officer
thee
and
i
are
to
part
by
and
by
and
peradventure
we
may
never
meet
again
but
be
advised
by
a
plain
man
modes
and
apparel
are
but
trifles
to
the
real
man
therefore
do
not
think
such
a
man
as
thyself
terrible
for
thy
garb
nor
such
a
one
as
me
contemptible
for
mine
when
two
such
as
thee
and
i
meet
with
affections
as
we
ought
to
have
towards
each
other
thou
shouldst
rejoice
to
see
my
peaceable
demeanour
and
i
should
be
glad
to
see
thy
strength
and

virg
there
is
scarce
anything
more
common
than
animosities
between
parties
that
can
not
subsist
but
by
their
agreement
this
was
well
represented
in
the
sedition
of
the
members
of
the
human
body
in
the
old
roman
fable
it
is
often
the
case
of
lesser
confederate
states
against
a
superior
power
which
are
hardly
held
together
though
their
unanimity
is
necessary
for
their
common
safety
and
this
is
always
the
case
of
the
landed
and
trading
interest
of
great
britain
the
trader
is
fed
by
the
product
of
the
land
and
the
landed
man
can
not
be
clothed
but
by
the
skill
of
the
trader
and
yet
those
interests
are
ever
jarring
we
had
last
winter
an
instance
of
this
at
our
club
in
sir
roger
de
coverley
and
sir
andrew
freeport
between
whom
there
is
generally
a
constant
though
friendly
opposition
of
opinions
it
happened
that
one
of
the
company
in
an
historical
discourse
was
observing
that
carthaginian
faith
was
a
proverbial
phrase
to
intimate
breach
of
leagues
sir
roger
said
it
could
hardly
be
otherwise
that
the
carthaginians
were
the
greatest
traders
in
the
world
and
as
gain
is
the
chief
end
of
such
a
people
they
never
pursue
any
other
the
means
to
it
are
never
regarded
they
will
if
it
comes
easily
get
money
honestly
but
if
not
they
will
not
scruple
to
attain
it
by
fraud
or
cozenage
and
indeed
what
is
the
whole
business
of
the
account
but
to
overreach
him
who
trusts
to
his
memory
but
were
that
not
so
what
can
there
great
and
noble
be
expected
from
him
whose
attention
is
forever
fixed
upon
balancing
his
books
and
watching
over
his
expenses
and
at
best
let
frugality
and
parsimony
be
the
virtues
of
the
merchant
how
much
is
his
punctual
dealing
below
a
gentleman
charity
to
the
poor
or
hospitality
among
his
neighbours
captain
sentry
observed
sir
andrew
very
diligent
in
hearing
sir
roger
and
had
a
mind
to
turn
the
discourse
by
taking
notice
in
general
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
parts
of
human
society
there
was
a
secret
though
unjust
way
among
men
of
indulging
the
seeds
of
and
envy
by
comparing
their
own
state
of
life
to
that
of
another
and
grudging
the
approach
of
their
neighbour
to
their
own
happiness
and
on
the
other
side
he
who
is
the
less
at
his
ease
repines
at
the
other
who
he
thinks
has
unjustly
the
advantage
over
him
thus
the
civil
and
military
lists
look
upon
each
other
with
much
the
soldier
repines
at
the
courtier
power
and
the
courtier
rallies
the
soldier
honour
or
to
come
to
lower
instances
the
private
men
in
the
horse
and
foot
of
an
army
the
carmen
and
coachmen
in
the
city
streets
mutually
look
upon
each
other
with
when
they
are
in
competition
for
quarters
or
the
way
in
their
respective
motions
the
soldiers
competing
for
quarters
the
carmen
and
coachmen
for
right
of
way
in
the
narrow
streets
it
is
very
well
good
captain
interrupted
sir
andrew
you
may
attempt
to
turn
the
discourse
if
you
think
fit
but
i
must
however
have
a
word
or
two
with
sir
roger
who
i
see
thinks
he
has
paid
me
off
and
been
very
severe
upon
the
merchant
i
shall
not
continued
he
at
this
time
remind
sir
roger
of
the
great
and
noble
monuments
of
charity
and
public
spirit
which
have
been
erected
by
merchants
since
the
reformation
but
at
present
content
myself
with
what
he
allows
us
parsimony
and
frugality
if
it
were
consistent
with
the
quality
of
so
ancient
a
baronet
as
sir
roger
to
keep
an
account
or
measure
things
by
the
most
infallible
way
that
of
numbers
he
would
prefer
our
parsimony
to
his
hospitality
if
to
drink
so
many
hogsheads
is
to
be
hospitable
we
do
not
contend
for
the
fame
of
that
virtue
but
it
would
be
worth
while
to
consider
whether
so
many
artificers
at
work
ten
days
together
by
my
appointment
or
so
many
peasants
made
merry
on
sir
roger
charge
are
the
men
more
obliged
i
believe
the
families
of
the
artificers
will
thank
me
more
than
the
households
of
the
peasants
shall
sir
roger
sir
roger
gives
to
his
men
but
i
place
mine
above
the
necessity
or
obligation
of
my
bounty
i
am
in
very
little
pain
for
the
roman
proverb
upon
the
carthaginian
traders
the
romans
were
their
professed
enemies
i
am
only
sorry
no
carthaginian
histories
have
come
to
our
hands
we
might
have
been
taught
perhaps
by
them
some
proverbs
against
the
roman
generosity
in
fighting
for
and
bestowing
other
people
goods
but
since
sir
roger
has
taken
occasion
from
an
old
proverb
to
be
out
of
humour
with
merchants
it
should
be
no
offence
to
offer
one
not
quite
so
old
in
their
defence
when
a
man
happens
to
break
in
holland
they
say
of
him
that
has
not
kept
true
accounts
this
phrase
perhaps
among
us
would
appear
a
soft
or
humorous
way
of
speaking
but
with
that
exact
nation
it
bears
the
highest
reproach
for
a
man
to
be
mistaken
in
the
calculation
of
his
expense
in
his
ability
to
answer
future
demands
or
to
be
impertinently
sanguine
in
putting
his
credit
to
too
great
adventure
are
all
instances
of
as
much
infamy
as
with
gayer
nations
to
be
failing
in
courage
or
common
honesty
workmen
mechanics
to
fail
become
bankrupt
unwarrantably
numbers
are
so
much
the
measure
of
everything
that
is
valuable
that
it
is
not
possible
to
demonstrate
the
success
of
any
action
or
the
prudence
of
any
undertaking
without
them
i
say
this
in
answer
to
what
sir
roger
is
pleased
to
say
that
that
is
truly
noble
can
be
expected
from
one
who
is
ever
poring
on
his
cashbook
or
balancing
his
accounts
when
i
have
my
returns
from
abroad
i
can
tell
to
a
shilling
by
the
help
of
numbers
the
profit
or
loss
by
my
adventure
but
i
ought
also
to
be
able
to
show
that
i
had
reason
for
making
it
either
from
my
own
experience
or
that
of
other
people
or
from
a
reasonable
presumption
that
my
returns
will
be
sufficient
to
answer
my
expense
and
hazard
and
this
is
never
to
be
done
without
the
skill
of
numbers
for
instance
if
i
am
to
trade
to
turkey
i
ought
beforehand
to
know
the
demand
of
our
manufactures
there
as
well
as
of
their
silks
in
england
and
the
customary
prices
that
are
given
for
both
in
each
country
i
ought
to
have
a
clear
knowledge
of
these
matters
beforehand
that
i
may
presume
upon
sufficient
returns
to
answer
the
charge
of
the
cargo
i
have
fitted
out
the
freight
and
assurance
out
and
home
the
custom
to
the
queen
and
the
interest
of
my
own
money
and
besides
all
these
expenses
a
reasonable
profit
to
myself
now
what
is
there
of
scandal
in
this
skill
what
has
the
merchant
done
that
he
should
be
so
little
in
the
good
graces
of
sir
roger
he
throws
down
no
man
enclosure
and
tramples
upon
no
man
corn
he
takes
nothing
from
the
industrious
labourer
he
pays
the
poor
man
for
his
work
he
communicates
his
profit
with
mankind
by
the
preparation
of
his
cargo
and
the
manufacture
of
his
returns
he
furnishes
employment
and
subsistence
to
greater
numbers
than
the
richest
nobleman
and
even
the
nobleman
is
obliged
to
him
for
finding
out
foreign
markets
for
the
produce
of
his
estate
and
for
making
a
great
addition
to
his
rents
and
yet
it
is
certain
that
none
of
all
these
things
could
be
done
by
him
without
the
exercise
of
his
skill
in
numbers
the
tariff
or
duty
shares
returns
income
this
is
the
economy
of
the
merchant
and
the
conduct
of
the
gentleman
must
be
the
same
unless
by
scorning
to
be
the
steward
he
resolves
the
steward
shall
be
the
gentleman
the
gentleman
no
more
than
the
merchant
is
able
without
the
help
of
numbers
to
account
for
the
success
of
any
action
or
the
prudence
of
any
adventure
if
for
instance
the
chase
is
his
whole
adventure
his
only
returns
must
be
the
stag
horns
in
the
great
hall
and
the
fox
nose
upon
the
stable
door
without
doubt
sir
roger
knows
the
full
value
of
these
returns
and
if
beforehand
he
had
computed
the
charges
of
the
chase
a
gentleman
of
his
discretion
would
certainly
have
hanged
up
all
his
dogs
he
would
never
have
brought
back
so
many
fine
horses
to
the
kennel
he
would
never
have
gone
so
often
like
a
blast
over
fields
of
corn
if
such
too
had
been
the
conduct
of
all
his
ancestors
he
might
truly
have
boasted
at
this
day
that
the
antiquity
of
his
family
had
never
been
sullied
by
a
trade
a
merchant
had
never
been
permitted
with
his
whole
estate
to
purchase
a
room
for
his
picture
in
the
gallery
of
the
coverley
or
to
claim
his
descent
from
the
maid
of
honour
but
is
very
happy
for
sir
roger
that
the
merchant
paid
so
dear
for
his
ambition
is
the
misfortune
of
many
other
gentlemen
to
turn
out
of
the
seats
of
their
ancestors
to
make
way
for
such
new
masters
as
have
been
more
exact
in
their
accounts
than
themselves
and
certainly
he
deserves
the
estate
a
great
deal
better
who
has
got
it
by
his
industry
than
he
who
has
lost
it
by
his
negligence
to
vacate

ovid
i
was
this
morning
surprised
with
a
great
knocking
at
the
door
when
my
landlady
daughter
came
up
to
me
and
told
me
that
there
was
a
man
below
desired
to
speak
with
me
upon
my
asking
her
who
it
was
she
told
me
it
was
a
very
grave
elderly
person
but
that
she
did
not
know
his
name
i
immediately
went
down
to
him
and
found
him
to
be
the
coachman
of
my
worthy
friend
sir
roger
de
coverley
he
told
me
that
his
master
came
to
town
last
night
and
would
be
glad
to
take
a
turn
with
me
in
gray
inn
walks
as
i
was
wondering
in
myself
what
had
brought
sir
roger
to
town
not
having
lately
received
any
letter
from
him
he
told
me
that
his
master
was
come
up
to
get
a
sight
of
prince
eugene
and
that
he
desired
i
would
immediately
meet
him
i
was
not
a
little
pleased
with
the
curiosity
of
the
old
knight
though
i
did
not
much
wonder
at
it
having
heard
him
say
more
than
once
in
private
discourse
that
he
looked
upon
prince
eugenio
for
so
the
knight
always
calls
him
to
be
a
greater
man
than
scanderbeg
i
was
no
sooner
come
into
gray
inn
walks
but
i
heard
my
friend
upon
the
terrace
hemming
twice
or
thrice
to
himself
with
great
vigour
for
he
loves
to
clear
his
pipes
in
good
air
to
make
use
of
his
own
phrase
and
is
not
a
little
pleased
with
any
one
who
takes
notice
of
the
strength
which
he
still
exerts
in
his
morning
hems
i
was
touched
with
a
secret
joy
at
the
sight
of
the
good
old
man
who
before
he
saw
me
was
engaged
in
conversation
with
a
that
had
asked
an
alms
of
him
i
could
hear
my
friend
chide
him
for
not
finding
out
some
work
but
at
the
same
time
saw
him
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
give
him
sixpence
our
salutations
were
very
hearty
on
both
sides
consisting
of
many
kind
shakes
of
the
hand
and
several
affectionate
looks
which
we
cast
upon
one
another
after
which
the
knight
told
me
my
good
friend
his
chaplain
was
very
well
and
much
at
my
service
and
that
the
sunday
before
he
had
made
a
most
incomparable
sermon
out
of
doctor
barrow
i
have
left
says
he
all
my
affairs
in
his
hands
and
being
willing
to
lay
an
obligation
upon
him
have
deposited
with
him
thirty
marks
to
be
distributed
among
his
poor
parishioners
he
then
proceeded
to
acquaint
me
with
the
welfare
of
will
wimble
upon
which
he
put
his
hand
into
his
fob
and
presented
me
in
his
name
with
a
tobacco
stopper
telling
me
that
will
had
been
busy
all
the
beginning
of
the
winter
in
turning
great
quantities
of
them
and
that
he
made
a
present
of
one
to
every
gentleman
in
the
country
who
has
good
principles
and
smokes
he
added
that
poor
will
was
at
present
under
great
tribulation
for
that
tom
touchy
had
taken
the
law
of
him
for
cutting
some
hazel
sticks
out
of
one
of
his
hedges
among
other
pieces
of
news
which
the
knight
brought
from
his
he
informed
me
that
moll
white
was
dead
and
that
about
a
month
after
her
death
the
wind
was
so
very
high
that
it
blew
down
the
end
of
one
of
his
barns
but
for
my
own
part
says
sir
roger
i
do
not
think
that
the
old
woman
had
any
hand
in
it
he
afterwards
fell
into
an
account
of
the
diversions
which
had
passed
in
his
house
during
the
holidays
for
sir
roger
after
the
laudable
custom
of
his
ancestors
always
keeps
open
house
at
christmas
i
learned
from
him
that
he
had
killed
eight
fat
hogs
for
this
season
that
he
had
dealt
about
his
chines
very
liberally
amongst
his
neighbours
and
that
in
particular
he
had
sent
a
string
of
with
a
pack
of
cards
to
every
poor
family
in
the
parish
i
have
often
thought
says
sir
roger
it
happens
very
well
that
christmas
should
fall
out
in
the
middle
of
the
winter
it
is
the
most
dead
uncomfortable
time
of
the
year
when
the
poor
people
would
suffer
very
much
from
their
poverty
and
cold
if
they
had
not
good
cheer
warm
fires
and
christmas
gambols
to
support
them
i
love
to
rejoice
their
poor
hearts
at
this
season
and
to
see
the
whole
village
merry
in
my
great
hall
i
allow
a
double
quantity
of
malt
to
my
small
beer
and
set
it
a
running
for
twelve
days
to
every
one
that
calls
for
it
i
have
always
a
piece
of
cold
beef
and
a
upon
the
table
and
am
wonderfully
pleased
to
see
my
tenants
pass
away
a
whole
evening
in
playing
their
innocent
tricks
and
smutting
one
another
our
friend
will
wimble
is
as
merry
as
any
of
them
and
shows
a
thousand
roguish
tricks
upon
these
occasions
sausages
i
was
very
much
delighted
with
the
reflection
of
my
old
friend
which
carried
so
much
goodness
in
it
he
then
launched
out
into
the
praise
of
the
late
act
of
parliament
for
securing
the
church
of
england
and
told
me
with
great
satisfaction
that
he
believed
it
already
began
to
take
effect
for
that
a
rigid
dissenter
who
chanced
to
dine
at
his
house
on
christmas
day
had
been
observed
to
eat
very
plentifully
of
his
after
having
dispatched
all
our
country
matters
sir
roger
made
several
inquiries
concerning
the
club
and
particularly
of
his
old
antagonist
sir
andrew
freeport
he
asked
me
with
a
kind
of
smile
whether
sir
andrew
had
not
taken
advantage
of
his
absence
to
vent
among
them
some
of
his
republican
doctrines
but
soon
after
gathering
up
his
countenance
into
a
more
than
ordinary
seriousness
tell
me
truly
says
he
do
you
think
sir
andrew
had
a
hand
in
the
pope
procession
but
without
giving
me
time
to
answer
him
well
well
says
he
i
know
you
are
a
wary
man
and
do
not
care
to
talk
of
public
matters
the
knight
then
asked
me
if
i
had
seen
prince
eugenio
and
made
me
promise
to
get
him
a
stand
in
some
convenient
place
where
he
might
have
a
full
sight
of
that
extraordinary
man
whose
presence
does
so
much
honour
to
the
british
nation
he
dwelt
very
long
on
the
praises
of
this
great
general
and
i
found
that
since
i
was
with
him
in
the
country
he
had
drawn
many
observations
together
out
of
his
reading
in
baker
and
other
authors
who
always
lie
in
his
hall
window
which
very
much
redound
to
the
honour
of
this
prince
having
passed
away
the
greatest
part
of
the
morning
in
hearing
the
knight
reflections
which
were
partly
private
and
partly
political
he
asked
me
if
i
would
smoke
a
pipe
with
him
over
a
dish
of
coffee
at
squire
as
i
love
the
old
man
i
take
delight
in
complying
with
everything
that
is
agreeable
to
him
and
accordingly
waited
on
him
to
the
where
his
venerable
figure
drew
upon
us
the
eyes
of
the
whole
room
he
had
no
sooner
seated
himself
at
the
upper
end
of
the
high
table
but
he
called
for
a
clean
pipe
a
paper
of
tobacco
a
dish
of
coffee
a
wax
candle
and
the
with
such
an
air
of
cheerfulness
and
good
humour
that
all
the
boys
in
the
who
seemed
to
take
pleasure
in
serving
him
were
at
once
employed
on
his
several
errands
insomuch
that
nobody
else
could
come
at
a
dish
of
tea
till
the
knight
had
got
all
his
conveniences
about
him
correct
the
careless
grammar
xxviii

my
friend
sir
roger
de
coverley
told
me
night
that
he
had
been
reading
my
paper
upon
westminster
abbey
in
which
says
he
there
are
a
great
many
ingenious
fancies
he
told
me
at
the
same
time
that
he
observed
i
had
promised
another
paper
upon
the
tombs
and
that
he
should
be
glad
to
go
and
see
them
with
me
not
having
visited
them
since
he
had
read
history
i
could
not
at
first
imagine
how
this
came
into
the
knight
head
till
i
recollected
that
he
had
been
very
busy
all
last
summer
upon
baker
which
he
has
quoted
several
times
in
his
disputes
with
sir
andrew
freeport
since
his
last
coming
to
town
accordingly
i
promised
to
call
upon
him
the
next
morning
that
we
might
go
together
to
the
abbey
i
found
the
knight
under
his
butler
hands
who
always
shaves
him
he
was
no
sooner
dressed
than
he
called
for
a
glass
of
the
widow
trueby
water
which
he
told
me
he
always
drank
before
he
went
abroad
he
recommended
me
to
a
dram
of
it
at
the
same
time
with
so
much
heartiness
that
i
could
not
forbear
drinking
it
as
soon
as
i
had
got
it
down
i
found
it
very
unpalatable
upon
which
the
knight
observing
that
i
had
made
several
wry
faces
told
me
that
he
knew
i
should
not
like
it
at
first
but
that
it
was
the
best
thing
in
the
world
against
the
stone
or
gravel
i
could
have
wished
indeed
that
he
had
acquainted
me
with
the
virtues
of
it
sooner
but
it
was
too
late
to
complain
and
i
knew
what
he
had
done
was
out
of
sir
roger
told
me
further
that
he
looked
upon
it
to
be
very
good
for
a
man
whilst
he
stayed
in
town
to
keep
off
infection
and
that
he
got
together
a
quantity
of
it
upon
the
first
news
of
the
sickness
being
at
dantzic
when
of
a
sudden
turning
short
to
one
of
his
servants
who
stood
behind
him
he
bid
him
call
a
and
take
care
it
was
an
elderly
man
that
drove
it
he
then
resumed
his
discourse
upon
water
telling
me
that
the
widow
trueby
was
one
who
did
more
good
than
all
the
doctors
and
apothecaries
in
the
county
that
she
distilled
every
poppy
that
grew
within
five
miles
of
her
that
she
distributed
her
water
gratis
among
all
sorts
of
people
to
which
the
knight
added
that
she
had
a
very
great
jointure
and
that
the
whole
country
would
fain
have
it
a
match
between
him
and
her
and
truly
said
sir
roger
if
i
had
not
been
engaged
perhaps
i
could
not
have
done
better
in
what
sense
his
discourse
was
broken
off
by
his
man
telling
him
he
had
called
a
coach
upon
our
going
to
it
after
having
cast
his
eye
upon
the
wheels
he
asked
the
coachman
if
his
was
good
upon
the
fellow
telling
him
he
would
warrant
it
the
knight
turned
to
me
told
me
he
looked
like
an
honest
man
and
went
in
without
further
ceremony
we
had
not
gone
far
when
sir
roger
popping
out
his
head
called
the
coachman
down
from
his
box
and
upon
his
presenting
himself
at
the
window
asked
him
if
he
smoked
as
i
was
considering
what
this
would
end
in
he
bid
him
stop
by
the
way
at
any
good
tobacconist
and
take
in
a
roll
of
their
best
virginia
nothing
material
happened
in
the
remaining
part
of
our
journey
till
we
were
set
down
at
the
west
end
of
the
abbey
as
we
went
up
the
body
of
the
church
the
knight
pointed
at
the
trophies
upon
one
of
the
new
monuments
and
cried
out
a
brave
man
i
warrant
him
passing
afterwards
by
sir
cloudesley
shovel
he
flung
his
hand
that
way
and
cried
sir
cloudesley
shovel
a
very
gallant
man
as
we
stood
before
busby
tomb
the
knight
uttered
himself
again
after
the
same
manner
busby
a
great
man
he
whipped
my
grandfather
a
very
great
man
i
should
have
gone
to
him
myself
if
i
had
not
been
a
blockhead
a
very
great
man
we
were
immediately
conducted
into
the
little
chapel
on
the
right
hand
sir
roger
planting
himself
at
our
historian
elbow
was
very
attentive
to
everything
he
said
particularly
to
the
account
he
gave
us
of
the
lord
who
had
cut
off
the
king
of
morocco
head
among
several
other
figures
he
was
very
well
pleased
to
see
the
statesman
cecil
upon
his
knees
and
concluding
them
all
to
be
great
men
was
conducted
to
the
figure
which
represents
that
martyr
to
good
housewifery
who
died
by
the
prick
of
a
needle
upon
our
interpreter
telling
us
that
she
was
a
maid
of
honour
to
queen
elizabeth
the
knight
was
very
inquisitive
into
her
name
and
family
and
after
having
regarded
her
finger
for
some
time
i
wonder
says
he
that
sir
richard
baker
has
said
nothing
of
her
in
his
the
guide
or
verger
we
were
then
conveyed
to
the
two
coronation
chairs
where
my
old
friend
after
having
heard
that
the
stone
underneath
the
most
ancient
of
them
which
was
brought
from
scotland
was
called
jacob
pillar
sat
himself
down
in
the
chair
and
looking
like
the
figure
of
an
old
gothic
king
asked
our
interpreter
what
authority
they
had
to
say
that
jacob
had
ever
been
in
scotland
the
fellow
instead
of
returning
him
an
answer
told
him
that
he
hoped
his
honour
would
pay
his
forfeit
i
could
observe
sir
roger
a
little
ruffled
upon
being
thus
trepanned
but
our
guide
not
insisting
upon
his
demand
the
knight
soon
recovered
his
good
humour
and
whispered
in
my
ear
that
if
will
wimble
were
with
us
and
saw
those
two
chairs
it
would
go
hard
but
he
would
get
a
out
of
one
or
of
them
for
sitting
down
in
the
chair
snared
caught
it
is
more
properly
spelled
trapanned
and
is
not
to
be
confused
with
the
verb
to
remove
a
piece
of
the
skull
sir
roger
in
the
next
place
laid
his
hand
upon
edward
the
third
sword
and
leaning
upon
the
pommel
of
it
gave
us
the
whole
history
of
the
black
prince
concluding
that
in
sir
richard
baker
opinion
edward
the
third
was
one
of
the
greatest
princes
that
ever
sat
upon
the
english
throne
we
were
then
shown
edward
the
confessor
tomb
upon
which
sir
roger
acquainted
us
that
he
was
the
first
who
touched
for
the
evil
and
afterwards
henry
the
fourth
upon
which
he
shook
his
head
and
told
us
there
was
fine
reading
in
the
casualties
of
that
reign
our
conductor
then
pointed
to
that
monument
where
there
is
the
figure
of
one
of
our
english
kings
without
an
head
and
upon
giving
us
to
know
that
the
head
which
was
of
beaten
silver
had
been
stolen
away
several
years
since
some
whig
i
warrant
you
says
sir
roger
you
ought
to
lock
up
your
kings
better
they
will
carry
off
the
body
too
if
you
do
take
care
the
glorious
names
of
henry
the
fifth
and
queen
elizabeth
gave
the
knight
great
opportunities
of
shining
and
of
doing
justice
to
sir
richard
baker
who
as
our
knight
observed
with
some
surprise
had
a
great
many
kings
in
him
whose
monuments
he
had
not
seen
in
the
abbey
for
my
own
part
i
could
not
but
be
pleased
to
see
the
knight
show
such
an
honest
passion
for
the
glory
of
his
country
and
such
a
respectful
gratitude
to
the
memory
of
its
princes
i
must
not
omit
that
the
benevolence
of
my
good
old
friend
which
flows
out
towards
every
one
he
converses
with
made
him
very
kind
to
our
interpreter
whom
he
looked
upon
as
an
extraordinary
man
for
which
reason
his
shook
him
by
the
hand
at
parting
telling
him
that
he
should
be
very
glad
to
see
him
at
his
lodgings
in
norfolk
buildings
and
talk
over
these
matters
with
him
more
at
leisure

my
friend
sir
roger
de
coverley
when
we
last
met
together
at
the
club
told
me
that
he
had
a
great
mind
to
see
the
new
tragedy
with
me
assuring
me
at
the
same
time
that
he
had
not
been
at
a
play
these
twenty
years
the
last
i
saw
said
sir
roger
was
the
which
i
should
not
have
gone
to
neither
had
not
i
been
told
beforehand
that
it
was
a
good
church
of
england
comedy
he
then
proceeded
to
inquire
of
me
who
this
distressed
mother
was
and
upon
hearing
that
she
was
hector
widow
he
told
me
that
her
husband
was
a
brave
man
and
that
when
he
was
a
schoolboy
he
had
read
his
life
at
the
end
of
the
dictionary
my
friend
asked
me
in
the
next
place
if
there
would
not
be
some
danger
in
coming
home
late
in
case
the
mohocks
should
be
abroad
i
assure
you
says
he
i
thought
i
had
fallen
into
their
hands
last
night
for
i
observed
two
or
three
lusty
black
men
that
followed
me
half
way
up
fleet
street
and
mended
their
pace
behind
me
in
proportion
as
i
put
on
to
get
away
from
them
you
must
know
continued
the
knight
with
a
smile
i
fancied
they
had
a
mind
to
me
for
i
remember
an
honest
gentleman
in
my
neighbourhood
who
was
served
such
a
trick
in
king
charles
the
second
time
for
which
reason
he
has
not
ventured
himself
in
town
ever
since
i
might
have
shown
them
very
good
sport
had
this
been
their
design
for
as
i
am
an
old
i
should
have
turned
and
dodged
and
have
played
them
a
thousand
tricks
they
had
never
seen
in
their
lives
before
sir
roger
added
that
if
these
gentlemen
had
any
such
intention
they
did
not
succeed
very
well
in
it
for
i
threw
them
out
says
he
at
the
end
of
norfolk
street
where
i
doubled
the
corner
and
got
shelter
in
my
lodgings
before
they
could
imagine
what
was
become
of
me
however
says
the
knight
if
captain
sentry
will
make
one
with
us
night
and
if
you
will
both
of
you
call
upon
me
about
four
that
we
may
be
at
the
house
before
it
is
full
i
will
have
my
own
coach
in
readiness
to
attend
you
for
john
tells
me
he
has
got
the

wheels
mended
perhaps
in
black
masks
the
captain
who
did
not
fail
to
meet
me
there
at
the
appointed
hour
bid
sir
roger
fear
nothing
for
that
he
had
put
on
the
same
sword
which
he
made
use
of
at
the
battle
of
steenkirk
sir
roger
servants
and
among
the
rest
my
old
friend
the
butler
had
i
found
provided
themselves
with
good
oaken
plants
to
attend
their
master
upon
this
occasion
when
he
had
placed
him
in
his
coach
with
myself
at
his
left
hand
the
captain
before
him
and
his
butler
at
the
head
of
his
footmen
in
the
rear
we
convoyed
him
in
safety
to
the
playhouse
where
after
having
marched
up
the
entry
in
good
order
the
captain
and
i
went
in
with
him
and
seated
him
betwixt
us
in
the
pit
as
soon
as
the
house
was
full
and
the
candles
lighted
my
old
friend
stood
up
and
looked
about
him
with
that
pleasure
which
a
mind
seasoned
with
humanity
naturally
feels
in
itself
at
the
sight
of
a
multitude
of
people
who
seem
pleased
with
one
another
and
partake
of
the
same
common
entertainment
i
could
not
but
fancy
to
myself
as
the
old
man
stood
up
in
the
middle
of
the
pit
that
he
made
a
very
proper
centre
to
a
tragic
audience
upon
the
entering
of
pyrrhus
the
knight
told
me
that
he
did
not
believe
the
king
of
france
himself
had
a
better
strut
i
was
indeed
very
attentive
to
my
old
friend
remarks
because
i
looked
upon
them
as
a
piece
of
natural
criticism
and
was
well
pleased
to
hear
him
at
the
conclusion
of
almost
every
scene
telling
me
that
he
could
not
imagine
how
the
play
would
end
one
while
he
appeared
much
concerned
for
andromache
and
a
little
while
after
as
much
for
hermione
and
was
extremely
puzzled
to
think
what
would
become
of
pyrrhus
sticks
cudgels
when
sir
roger
saw
andromache
obstinate
refusal
to
her
lover
importunities
he
whispered
me
in
the
ear
that
he
was
sure
she
would
never
have
him
to
which
he
added
with
a
more
than
ordinary
vehemence
you
ca
imagine
sir
what
is
to
have
to
do
with
a
widow
upon
pyrrhus
his
threatening
afterwards
to
leave
her
the
knight
shook
his
head
and
muttered
to
himself
ay
do
if
you
can
this
part
dwelt
so
much
upon
my
friend
imagination
that
at
the
close
of
the
third
act
as
i
was
thinking
of
something
else
he
whispered
in
my
ear
these
widows
sir
are
the
most
perverse
creatures
in
the
world
but
pray
says
he
you
that
are
a
critic
is
the
play
according
to
your
dramatic
rules
as
you
call
them
should
your
people
in
tragedy
always
talk
to
be
understood
why
there
is
not
a
single
sentence
in
this
play
that
i
do
not
know
the
meaning
of
this
form
of
the
possessive
was
still
occasionally
used
when
the
noun
ended
in
the
fourth
act
very
luckily
begun
before
i
had
time
to
give
the
old
gentleman
an
answer
well
says
the
knight
sitting
down
with
great
satisfaction
i
suppose
we
are
now
to
see
hector
ghost
he
then
renewed
his
attention
and
from
time
to
time
fell
a
praising
the
widow
he
made
indeed
a
little
mistake
as
to
one
of
her
pages
whom
at
his
first
entering
he
took
for
astyanax
but
he
quickly
set
himself
right
in
that
particular
though
at
the
same
time
he
owned
he
should
have
been
very
glad
to
have
seen
the
little
boy
who
says
he
must
needs
be
a
very
fine
child
by
the
account
that
is
given
of
him
upon
hermione
going
off
with
a
menace
to
pyrrhus
the
audience
gave
a
loud
clap
to
which
sir
roger
added
on
my
word
a
notable
young
baggage
as
there
was
a
very
remarkable
silence
and
stillness
in
the
audience
during
the
whole
action
it
was
natural
for
them
to
take
the
opportunity
of
these
intervals
between
the
acts
to
express
their
opinion
of
the
players
and
of
their
respective
parts
sir
roger
hearing
a
cluster
of
them
praise
orestes
struck
in
with
them
and
told
them
that
he
thought
his
friend
pylades
was
a
very
sensible
man
as
they
were
afterwards
applauding
pyrrhus
sir
roger
put
in
a
second
time
and
let
me
tell
you
says
he
though
he
speaks
but
little
i
like
the
old
fellow
in
whiskers
as
well
as
any
of
them
captain
sentry
seeing
two
or
three
wags
who
sat
near
us
lean
with
an
attentive
ear
towards
sir
roger
and
fearing
lest
they
should
smoke
the
knight
plucked
him
by
the
elbow
and
whispered
something
in
his
ear
that
lasted
till
the
opening
of
the
fifth
act
the
knight
was
wonderfully
attentive
to
the
account
which
orestes
gives
of
pyrrhus
his
death
and
at
the
conclusion
of
it
told
me
it
was
such
a
bloody
piece
of
work
that
he
was
glad
it
was
not
done
upon
the
stage
seeing
afterwards
orestes
in
his
raving
fit
he
grew
more
than
ordinary
serious
and
took
occasion
to
moralize
in
his
way
upon
an
evil
conscience
adding
that
orestes
in
his
madness
looked
as
if
he
saw
something
ridicule
chaff
as
we
were
the
first
that
came
into
the
house
so
we
were
the
last
that
went
out
of
it
being
resolved
to
have
a
clear
passage
for
our
old
friend
whom
we
did
not
care
to
venture
among
the
justling
of
the
crowd
sir
roger
went
out
fully
satisfied
with
his
entertainment
and
we
guarded
him
to
his
lodgings
in
the
same
manner
that
we
brought
him
to
the
playhouse
being
highly
pleased
for
my
own
part
not
only
with
the
performance
of
the
excellent
piece
which
had
been
presented
but
with
the
satisfaction
which
it
had
given
to
the
good
old
man

as
we
were
at
the
club
last
night
i
observed
that
my
friend
sir
roger
contrary
to
his
usual
custom
sat
very
silent
and
instead
of
minding
what
was
said
by
the
company
was
whistling
to
himself
in
a
very
thoughtful
mood
and
playing
with
a
cork
i
jogged
sir
andrew
freeport
who
sat
between
us
and
as
we
were
both
observing
him
we
saw
the
knight
shake
his
head
and
heard
him
say
to
himself
a
foolish
woman
i
ca
believe
it
sir
andrew
gave
him
a
gentle
pat
upon
the
shoulder
and
offered
to
lay
him
a
bottle
of
wine
that
he
was
thinking
of
the
widow
my
old
friend
started
and
recovering
out
of
his
brown
study
told
sir
andrew
that
once
in
his
life
he
had
been
in
the
right
in
short
after
some
little
hesitation
sir
roger
told
us
in
the
fullness
of
his
heart
that
he
had
just
received
a
letter
from
his
steward
which
acquainted
him
that
his
old
rival
and
antagonist
in
the
county
sir
david
dundrum
had
been
making
a
visit
to
the
widow
however
says
sir
roger
i
can
never
think
that
she
have
a
man
that
half
a
year
older
than
i
am
and
a
noted
republican
into
the
bargain
will
honeycomb
who
looks
upon
love
as
his
particular
province
interrupting
our
friend
with
a
jaunty
laugh
i
thought
knight
says
he
thou
hadst
lived
long
enough
in
the
world
not
to
pin
thy
happiness
upon
one
that
is
a
woman
and
a
widow
i
think
that
without
vanity
i
may
pretend
to
know
as
much
of
the
female
world
as
any
man
in
great
britain
though
the
chief
of
my
knowledge
consists
in
this
that
they
are
not
to
be
known
will
immediately
with
his
usual
fluency
rambled
into
an
account
of
his
own
amours
i
am
now
says
he
upon
the
verge
of
fifty
though
by
the
way
we
all
knew
he
was
turned
of
threescore
you
may
easily
guess
continued
will
that
i
have
not
lived
so
long
in
the
world
without
having
had
some
thoughts
of
settling
in
it
as
the
phrase
is
to
tell
you
truly
i
have
several
times
tried
my
fortune
that
way
though
i
ca
much
boast
of
my
success
i
made
my
first
addresses
to
a
young
lady
in
the
country
but
when
i
thought
things
were
pretty
well
drawing
to
a
conclusion
her
father
happening
to
hear
that
i
had
formerly
boarded
with
a
surgeon
the
old
put
forbid
me
his
house
and
within
a
fortnight
after
married
his
daughter
to
a
fox
hunter
in
the
neighbourhood
rustic
clown
i
made
my
next
applications
to
a
widow
and
attacked
her
so
briskly
that
i
thought
myself
within
a
fortnight
of
her
as
i
waited
upon
her
one
morning
she
told
me
that
she
intended
to
keep
her
ready
money
and
jointure
in
her
own
hand
and
desired
me
to
call
upon
her
attorney
in
lyon
inn
who
would
adjust
with
me
what
it
was
proper
for
me
to
add
to
it
i
was
so
rebuffed
by
this
overture
that
i
never
inquired
either
for
her
or
her
attorney
afterwards
property
or
estate
settled
on
a
wife
to
be
enjoyed
after
the
death
of
her
husband
a
few
months
after
i
addressed
myself
to
a
young
lady
who
was
an
only
daughter
and
of
a
good
family
i
danced
with
her
at
several
balls
squeezed
her
by
the
hand
said
soft
things
and
in
short
made
no
doubt
of
her
heart
and
though
my
fortune
was
not
equal
to
hers
i
was
in
hopes
that
her
fond
father
would
not
deny
her
the
man
she
had
fixed
her
affections
upon
but
as
i
went
one
day
to
the
house
in
order
to
break
the
matter
to
him
i
found
the
whole
family
in
confusion
and
heard
to
my
unspeakable
surprise
that
miss
jenny
was
that
very
morning
run
away
with
the
butler
i
then
courted
a
second
widow
and
am
at
a
loss
to
this
day
how
i
came
to
miss
her
for
she
had
often
commended
my
person
and
behaviour
her
maid
indeed
told
me
one
day
that
her
mistress
had
said
she
never
saw
a
gentleman
with
such
a
spindle
pair
of
legs
as
honeycomb
after
this
i
laid
siege
to
four
heiresses
successively
and
being
a
handsome
young
dog
in
those
days
quickly
made
a
breach
in
their
hearts
but
i
do
know
how
it
came
to
pass
though
i
seldom
failed
of
getting
the
consent
i
could
never
in
my
life
get
the
old
people
on
my
side
i
could
give
you
an
account
of
a
thousand
other
unsuccessful
attempts
particularly
of
one
which
i
made
some
years
since
upon
an
old
woman
whom
i
had
certainly
borne
away
with
flying
colours
if
her
relations
had
not
come
pouring
in
to
her
assistance
from
all
parts
of
england
nay
i
believe
i
should
have
got
her
at
last
had
not
she
been
carried
off
by
an
hard
frost
as
will
transitions
are
extremely
quick
he
turned
from
sir
roger
and
applying
himself
to
me
told
me
there
was
a
passage
in
the
book
i
had
considered
last
saturday
which
deserved
to
be
writ
in
letters
of
gold
and
taking
out
a
pocket
milton
read
the
following
lines
which
are
part
of
one
of
adam
speeches
to
eve
after
the
fall
oh
why
did
our
creator
wise
that
peopled
highest
heaven
with
spirits
masculine
create
at
last
this
novelty
on
earth
this
fair
defect
of
nature
and
not
fill
the
world
at
once
with
men
as
angels
without
feminine
or
find
some
other
way
to
generate
mankind
this
mischief
had
not
then
befallen
and
more
that
shall
befall
innumerable
disturbances
on
earth
through
female
snares
and
straight
conjunction
with
this
sex
for
either
he
never
shall
find
out
fit
mate
but
such
as
some
misfortune
brings
him
or
mistake
or
whom
he
wishes
most
shall
seldom
gain
through
her
perverseness
but
shall
see
her
gained
by
a
far
worse
or
if
she
love
withheld
by
parents
or
his
happiest
choice
too
late
shall
meet
already
linked
and
to
a
fell
adversary
his
hate
or
shame
which
infinite
calamity
shall
cause
to
human
life
and
household
peace
confound
intimate
union
sir
roger
listened
to
this
passage
with
great
attention
and
desiring
honeycomb
to
fold
down
a
leaf
at
the
place
and
lend
him
his
book
the
knight
put
it
up
in
his
pocket
and
told
us
that
he
would
read
over
those
verses
again
before
he
went
to
bed
xxxi
sir
roger
at
vauxhall
no
tuesday
may
addison
criminibus
debent
hortos
juv
as
i
was
sitting
in
my
chamber
and
thinking
on
a
subject
for
my
next
i
heard
two
or
three
irregular
bounces
at
my
landlady
door
and
upon
the
opening
of
it
a
loud
cheerful
voice
inquiring
whether
the
philosopher
was
at
home
the
child
who
went
to
the
door
answered
very
innocently
that
he
did
not
lodge
there
i
immediately
recollected
that
it
was
my
good
friend
sir
roger
voice
and
that
i
had
promised
to
go
with
him
on
the
water
to
spring
garden
in
case
it
proved
a
good
evening
the
knight
put
me
in
mind
of
my
promise
from
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
but
told
me
that
if
i
was
speculating
he
would
stay
below
till
i
had
done
upon
my
coming
down
i
found
all
the
children
of
the
family
got
about
my
old
friend
and
my
landlady
herself
who
is
a
notable
prating
gossip
engaged
in
a
conference
with
him
being
mightily
pleased
with
his
stroking
her
little
boy
upon
the
head
and
bidding
him
be
a
good
child
and
mind
his
book
we
were
no
sooner
come
to
the
temple
stairs
but
we
were
surrounded
with
a
crowd
of
watermen
offering
us
their
respective
services
sir
roger
after
having
looked
about
him
very
attentively
spied
one
with
a
wooden
leg
and
immediately
gave
him
orders
to
get
his
boat
ready
as
we
were
walking
towards
it
you
must
know
says
sir
roger
i
never
make
use
of
anybody
to
row
me
that
has
not
either
lost
a
leg
or
an
arm
i
would
rather
bate
him
a
few
strokes
of
his
oar
than
not
employ
an
honest
man
that
had
been
wounded
in
the
queen
service
if
i
was
a
lord
or
a
bishop
and
kept
a
barge
i
would
not
put
a
fellow
in
my
livery
that
had
not
a
wooden
leg
my
old
friend
after
having
seated
himself
and
trimmed
the
boat
with
his
coachman
who
being
a
very
sober
man
always
serves
for
ballast
on
these
occasions
we
made
the
best
of
our
way
for
sir
roger
obliged
the
waterman
to
give
us
the
history
of
his
right
leg
and
hearing
that
he
had
left
it
at
la
hogue
with
many
particulars
which
passed
in
that
glorious
action
the
knight
in
the
triumph
of
his
heart
made
several
reflections
on
the
greatness
of
the
british
nation
as
that
one
englishman
could
beat
three
frenchmen
that
we
could
never
be
in
danger
of
popery
so
long
as
we
took
care
of
our
fleet
that
the
thames
was
the
noblest
river
in
europe
that
london
bridge
was
a
greater
piece
of
work
than
any
of
the
seven
wonders
of
the
world
with
many
other
honest
prejudices
which
naturally
cleave
to
the
heart
of
a
true
englishman
after
some
short
pause
the
old
knight
turning
about
his
head
twice
or
thrice
to
take
a
survey
of
this
great
metropolis
bid
me
observe
how
thick
the
city
was
set
with
churches
and
that
there
was
scarce
a
single
steeple
on
this
side
temple
bar
a
most
heathenish
sight
says
sir
roger
there
is
no
religion
at
this
end
of
the
town
the
fifty
new
churches
will
very
much
mend
the
prospect
but
church
work
is
slow
church
work
is
slow
i
do
not
remember
i
have
anywhere
mentioned
in
sir
roger
character
his
custom
of
saluting
everybody
that
passes
by
him
with
a
or
a
this
the
old
man
does
out
of
the
overflowings
of
his
humanity
though
at
the
same
time
it
renders
him
so
popular
among
all
his
country
neighbours
that
it
is
thought
to
have
gone
a
good
way
in
making
him
once
or
twice
knight
of
the
shire
he
can
not
forbear
this
exercise
of
benevolence
even
in
town
when
he
meets
with
any
one
in
his
morning
or
evening
walk
it
broke
from
him
to
several
boats
that
passed
by
us
upon
the
water
but
to
the
knight
great
surprise
as
he
gave
the
to
two
or
three
young
fellows
a
little
before
our
landing
one
of
them
instead
of
returning
the
civility
asked
us
what
queer
old
put
we
had
in
the
boat
with
a
great
deal
of
the
like
thames
ribaldry
sir
roger
seemed
a
little
shocked
at
first
but
at
length
assuming
a
face
of
magistracy
told
us
that
if
he
were
a
middlesex
justice
he
would
make
such
vagrants
know
that
her
majesty
subjects
were
no
more
to
be
abused
by
water
than
by
land
we
were
now
arrived
at
spring
garden
which
is
exquisitely
pleasant
at
this
time
of
year
when
i
considered
the
fragrancy
of
the
walks
and
bowers
with
the
choirs
of
birds
that
sung
upon
the
trees
and
the
loose
tribe
of
people
that
walked
under
their
shades
i
could
not
but
look
upon
the
place
as
a
kind
of
mahometan
paradise
sir
roger
told
me
it
put
him
in
mind
of
a
little
coppice
by
his
house
in
the
country
which
his
chaplain
used
to
call
an
aviary
of
nightingales
you
must
understand
says
the
knight
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
that
pleases
a
man
in
love
so
much
as
your
nightingale
ah
spectator
the
many
moonlight
nights
that
i
have
walked
by
myself
and
thought
on
the
widow
by
the
music
of
the
nightingales
he
here
fetched
a
deep
sigh
and
was
falling
into
a
fit
of
musing
when
a
mask
who
came
behind
him
gave
him
a
gentle
tap
upon
the
shoulder
and
asked
him
if
he
would
drink
a
bottle
of
mead
with
her
but
the
knight
being
startled
at
so
unexpected
a
familiarity
and
displeased
to
be
interrupted
in
his
thoughts
of
the
widow
told
her
she
was
a
wanton
baggage
and
bid
her
go
about
her
business
a
woman
wearing
a
mask
we
concluded
our
walk
with
a
glass
of
burton
ale
and
a
slice
of
hung
beef
when
we
had
done
eating
ourselves
the
knight
called
a
waiter
to
him
and
bid
him
carry
the
remainder
to
the
waterman
that
had
but
one
leg
i
perceived
the
fellow
stared
upon
him
at
the
oddness
of
the
message
and
was
going
to
be
saucy
upon
which
i
ratified
the
knight
commands
with
a
peremptory
look
as
we
were
going
out
of
the
garden
my
old
friend
thinking
himself
obliged
as
a
member
of
the
quorum
to
animadvert
upon
the
morals
of
the
place
told
the
mistress
of
the
house
who
sat
at
the
bar
that
he
should
be
a
better
customer
to
her
garden
if
there
were
more
nightingales
and
fewer
strumpets

we
last
night
received
a
piece
of
ill
news
at
our
club
which
very
sensibly
afflicted
every
one
of
us
i
question
not
but
my
readers
themselves
will
be
troubled
at
the
hearing
of
it
to
keep
them
no
longer
in
suspense
sir
roger
de
coverley
he
departed
this
life
at
his
house
in
the
country
after
a
few
weeks
sickness
sir
andrew
freeport
has
a
letter
from
one
of
his
correspondents
in
those
parts
that
informs
him
the
old
man
caught
a
cold
at
the
county
sessions
as
he
was
very
warmly
promoting
an
address
of
his
own
penning
in
which
he
succeeded
according
to
his
wishes
but
this
particular
comes
from
a
whig
justice
of
peace
who
was
always
sir
roger
enemy
and
antagonist
i
have
letters
both
from
the
chaplain
and
captain
sentry
which
mention
nothing
of
it
but
are
filled
with
many
particulars
to
the
honour
of
the
good
old
man
i
have
likewise
a
letter
from
the
butler
who
took
so
much
care
of
me
last
summer
when
i
was
at
the
knight
house
as
my
friend
the
butler
mentions
in
the
simplicity
of
his
heart
several
circumstances
the
others
have
passed
over
in
silence
i
shall
give
my
reader
a
copy
of
his
letter
without
any
alteration
or
diminution
honoured
sir
knowing
that
you
was
my
old
master
good
friend
i
could
not
forbear
sending
you
the
melancholy
news
of
his
death
which
has
afflicted
the
whole
country
as
well
as
his
poor
servants
who
loved
him
i
may
say
better
than
we
did
our
lives
i
am
afraid
he
caught
his
death
the
last
county
sessions
where
he
would
go
to
see
justice
done
to
a
poor
widow
woman
and
her
fatherless
children
that
had
been
wronged
by
a
neighbouring
gentleman
for
you
know
sir
my
good
master
was
always
the
poor
man
friend
upon
his
coming
home
the
first
complaint
he
made
was
that
he
had
lost
his
roast
beef
stomach
not
being
able
to
touch
a
sirloin
which
was
served
up
according
to
custom
and
you
know
he
used
to
take
great
delight
in
it
from
that
time
forward
he
grew
worse
and
worse
but
still
kept
a
good
heart
to
the
last
indeed
we
were
once
in
great
hope
of
his
recovery
upon
a
kind
message
that
was
sent
him
from
the
widow
lady
whom
he
had
made
love
to
the
forty
last
years
of
his
life
but
this
only
proved
a
before
death
he
has
bequeathed
to
this
lady
as
a
token
of
his
love
a
great
pearl
necklace
and
a
couple
of
silver
bracelets
set
with
jewels
which
belonged
to
my
good
old
lady
his
mother
he
has
bequeathed
the
fine
white
gelding
that
he
used
to
ride
a
hunting
upon
to
his
chaplain
because
he
thought
he
would
be
kind
to
him
and
has
left
you
all
his
books
he
has
moreover
bequeathed
to
the
chaplain
a
very
pretty
tenement
with
good
lands
about
it
it
being
a
very
cold
day
when
he
made
his
will
he
left
for
mourning
to
every
man
in
the
parish
a
great
frieze
coat
and
to
every
woman
a
black
it
was
a
most
moving
sight
to
see
him
take
leave
of
his
poor
servants
commending
us
all
for
our
fidelity
whilst
we
were
not
able
to
speak
a
word
for
weeping
as
we
most
of
us
are
grown
in
our
dear
master
service
he
has
left
us
pensions
and
legacies
which
we
may
live
very
comfortably
upon
the
remaining
part
of
our
days
he
has
bequeath
a
great
deal
more
in
charity
which
is
not
yet
come
to
my
knowledge
and
it
is
peremptorily
said
in
the
parish
that
he
has
left
money
to
build
a
steeple
to
the
church
for
he
was
heard
to
say
some
time
ago
that
if
he
lived
two
years
longer
coverley
church
should
have
a
steeple
to
it
the
chaplain
tells
everybody
that
he
made
a
very
good
end
and
never
speaks
of
him
without
tears
he
was
buried
according
to
his
own
directions
among
the
family
of
the
coverley
on
the
left
hand
of
his
father
sir
arthur
the
coffin
was
carried
by
six
of
his
tenants
and
the
pall
held
up
by
six
of
the
quorum
the
whole
parish
follow
the
corpse
with
heavy
hearts
and
in
their
mourning
suits
the
men
in
frieze
and
the
women
in
captain
sentry
my
master
nephew
has
taken
possession
of
the
hall
house
and
the
whole
estate
when
my
old
master
saw
him
a
little
before
his
death
he
shook
him
by
the
hand
and
wished
him
joy
of
the
estate
which
was
falling
to
him
desiring
him
only
to
make
good
use
of
it
and
to
pay
the
several
legacies
and
the
gifts
of
charity
which
he
told
him
he
had
left
as
quitrents
upon
the
estate
the
captain
truly
seems
a
courteous
man
though
he
says
but
little
he
makes
much
of
those
whom
my
master
loved
and
shows
great
kindness
to
the
old
house
dog
that
you
know
my
poor
master
was
so
fond
of
it
would
have
gone
to
your
heart
to
have
heard
the
moans
the
dumb
creature
made
on
the
day
of
my
death
he
has
joyed
himself
since
no
more
has
any
of
us
was
the
melancholiest
day
for
the
poor
people
that
ever
happened
in
worcestershire
this
being
all
from
honoured
sir
your
most
sorrowful
servant
edward
biscuit
my
master
desired
some
weeks
before
he
died
that
a
book
which
comes
up
to
you
by
the
carrier
should
be
given
to
sir
andrew
freeport
in
his
name
good
courage
this
letter
notwithstanding
the
poor
butler
manner
of
writing
it
gave
us
such
an
idea
of
our
good
old
friend
that
upon
the
reading
of
it
there
was
not
a
dry
eye
in
the
club
sir
andrew
opening
the
book
found
it
to
be
a
collection
of
acts
of
parliament
there
was
in
particular
the
act
of
uniformity
with
some
passages
in
it
marked
by
sir
roger
own
hand
sir
andrew
found
that
they
related
to
two
or
three
points
which
he
had
disputed
with
sir
roger
the
last
time
he
appeared
at
the
club
sir
andrew
who
would
have
been
merry
at
such
an
incident
on
another
occasion
at
the
sight
of
the
old
man
handwriting
burst
into
tears
and
put
the
book
into
his
pocket

informs
me
that
the

has
left
rings
and
mourning
for

coverley
hall
worcestershire
sir
i
am
come
to
the
succession
of
the
estate
of
my
honoured
kinsman
sir
roger
de
coverley
and
i
assure
you
i
find
it
no
easy
task
to
keep
up
the
figure
of
master
of
the
fortune
which
was
so
handsomely
enjoyed
by
that
honest
plain
man
i
can
not
with
respect
to
the
great
obligations
i
have
be
it
spoken
reflect
upon
his
character
but
i
am
confirmed
in
the
truth
which
i
have
i
think
heard
spoken
at
the
club
to
wit
that
a
man
of
a
warm
and
heart
with
a
very
small
capacity
is
highly
superior
in
human
society
to
him
who
with
the
greatest
talents
is
cold
and
languid
in
his
affections
but
alas
why
do
i
make
a
difficulty
in
speaking
of
my
worthy
ancestor
failings
his
little
absurdities
and
incapacity
for
the
conversation
of
the
politest
men
are
dead
with
him
and
his
greater
qualities
are
even
now
useful
to
him
i
know
not
whether
by
naming
those
disabilities
i
do
not
enhance
his
merit
since
he
has
left
behind
him
a
reputation
in
his
country
which
would
be
worth
the
pains
of
the
wisest
man
whole
life
to
arrive
at
the
society
of
but
indeed
my
chief
business
at
this
time
is
to
represent
to
you
my
present
state
of
mind
and
the
satisfactions
i
promise
to
myself
in
the
possession
of
my
new
fortune
i
have
continued
all
sir
roger
servants
except
such
as
it
was
a
relief
to
dismiss
into
little
beings
within
my
manor
those
who
are
in
a
list
of
the
good
knight
own
hand
to
be
taken
care
of
by
me
i
have
quartered
upon
such
as
have
taken
new
leases
of
me
and
added
so
many
advantages
during
the
lives
of
the
persons
so
quartered
that
it
is
the
interest
of
those
whom
they
are
joined
with
to
cherish
and
befriend
them
upon
all
occasions
livings
i
find
a
considerable
sum
of
ready
money
which
i
am
laying
out
among
my
dependants
at
the
common
interest
but
with
a
design
to
lend
it
according
to
their
merit
rather
than
according
to
their
ability
i
shall
lay
a
tax
upon
such
as
i
have
highly
obliged
to
become
security
to
me
for
such
of
their
own
poor
youth
whether
male
or
female
as
want
help
towards
getting
into
some
being
in
the
world
i
hope
i
shall
be
able
to
manage
my
affairs
so
as
to
improve
my
fortune
every
year
by
doing
acts
of
kindness
i
will
lend
my
money
to
the
use
of
none
but
indigent
men
secured
by
such
as
have
ceased
to
be
indigent
by
the
favour
of
my
family
or
myself
what
makes
this
the
more
practicable
is
that
if
they
will
do
any
one
good
with
my
money
they
are
welcome
to
it
upon
their
own
security
and
i
make
no
exception
against
it
because
the
persons
who
enter
into
the
obligations
do
it
for
their
own
family
i
have
laid
out
four
thousand
pounds
this
way
and
it
is
not
to
be
imagined
what
a
crowd
of
people
are
obliged
by
it
in
cases
where
sir
roger
has
recommended
i
have
lent
money
to
put
out
children
with
a
clause
which
makes
void
the
obligation
in
case
the
infant
dies
before
he
is
out
of
his
apprenticeship
by
which
means
the
kindred
and
masters
are
extremely
careful
of
breeding
him
to
industry
that
he
may
repay
it
himself
by
his
labour
in
three
after
his
time
is
out
for
the
use
of
his
securities
opportunities
of
this
kind
are
all
that
have
occurred
since
i
came
to
my
estate
but
i
assure
you
i
will
preserve
a
constant
disposition
to
catch
at
all
the
occasions
i
can
to
promote
the
good
and
happiness
of
my
neighbourhood
getting
their
living
in
some
way
apprentice
a
minor
one
not
years
of
age
those
who
have
given
security
for
him
but
it
is
difficult
to
get
any
precise
meaning
from
the
sentence
another
instance
of
steele
carelessness
of
expression
but
give
me
leave
to
lay
before
you
a
little
establishment
which
has
grown
out
of
my
past
life
that
i
doubt
not
will
administer
great
satisfaction
to
me
in
that
part
of
it
whatever
that
is
which
is
to
come
there
is
a
prejudice
in
favour
of
the
way
of
life
to
which
a
man
has
been
educated
which
i
know
not
whether
it
would
not
be
faulty
to
overcome
it
is
like
a
partiality
to
the
interest
of
own
country
before
that
of
any
other
nation
it
is
from
an
habit
of
thinking
grown
upon
me
from
my
youth
spent
in
arms
that
i
have
ever
held
gentlemen
who
have
preserved
modesty
justice
and
humanity
in
a
soldier
life
to
be
the
most
valuable
and
worthy
persons
of
the
human
race
to
pass
through
imminent
dangers
suffer
painful
watchings
frightful
alarms
and
laborious
marches
for
the
greater
part
of
a
man
time
and
pass
the
rest
in
a
sobriety
conformable
to
the
rules
of
the
most
virtuous
civil
life
is
a
merit
too
great
to
deserve
the
treatment
it
usually
meets
with
among
the
other
part
of
the
world
but
i
assure
you
sir
were
there
not
very
many
who
have
this
worth
we
could
never
have
seen
the
glorious
events
which
we
have
in
our
days
i
need
not
say
more
to
illustrate
the
character
of
a
soldier
than
to
tell
you
he
is
the
very
contrary
to
him
you
observe
loud
saucy
and
overbearing
in
a
red
coat
about
town
but
i
was
going
to
tell
you
that
in
honour
of
the
profession
of
arms
i
have
set
apart
a
certain
sum
of
money
for
a
table
for
such
gentlemen
as
have
served
their
country
in
the
army
and
will
please
from
time
to
time
to
sojourn
all
or
any
part
of
the
year
at

let

examine
a

honest
man
of
either
side
upon
those
opinions
in
religion
and
government
which
both
parties
daily
buffet
each
other
about
he
shall
hardly
find
one
material
point
in
difference
between
them
the
principal
questions
upon
which
whig
and
tory
had
once
actively
differed
and
still
continued
to
differ
in
theory
were
two
the
first
was
the
nature
of
the
monarchy
and
its
relation
to
the
other
parts
of
the
government
the
extreme
tories
held
that
the
king
had
a
divine
right
to
his
throne
by
hereditary
succession
that
this
was
indefeasible
and
implied
the
duty
of
unconditional
obedience
from
the
subject
the
extreme
whigs
held
that
the
king
was
the
creation
of
the
people
and
held
his
office
purely
by
act
of
parliament
but
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
find
many
such
extreme
tories
or
extreme
whigs
the
doctrine
of
the
divine
right
of
kings
had
been
practically
refuted
by
the
revolution
of
if
there
were
any
such
right
then
the
crown
belonged
not
to
anne
but
to
the
pretender
son
of
james
ii
on
the
other
hand
few
whigs
would
have
denied
that
the
monarchy
was
an
essential
part
of
the
english
system
of
government
and
not
the
mere
creature
of
parliament
the
other
and
more
important
subject
of
difference
between
the
two
parties
was
the
relation
of
the
church
to
the
state
and
to
dissent
the
tories
were
churchmen
and
held
that
the
interests
of
the
church
and
of
religion
demanded
more
constant
and
detailed
attention
from
the
state
and
more
stringent
measures
to
repress
dissent
they
always
called
themselves
the
church
party
queen
anne
never
called
them
anything
else
the
whigs
on
the
other
hand
though
many
of
them
were
good
churchmen
apprehended
less
danger
from
dissent
and
were
more
liberal
toward
it
the
dissenters
themselves
of
course
were
all
whigs
there
was
however
another
difference
between
the
two
parties
quite
as
important
as
any
speculative
question
and
daily
growing
more
important
as
was
stated
in
the
introduction
the
most
significant
social
fact
in
the
england
of
the
first
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
is
the
growth
of
a
great
middle
commercial
class
who
were
gaining
wealth
rapidly
and
filling
up
the
towns
at
the
bottom
of
much
political
controversy
between
and
was
the
undefined
jealousy
between
this
class
and
the
landed
class
it
was
trade
against
land
new
wealth
against
old
aristocracy
town
against
country
for
this
commercial
class
almost
to
a
man
were
whigs
the
landed
gentry
and
their
dependants
country
squires
and
country
parsons
almost
to
a
man
were
tories
this
jealousy
became
extremely
bitter
about
during
all
the
reign
of
anne
england
had
been
engaged
in
the
great
war
of
the
spanish
succession
the
real
object
of
which
was
to
prevent
the
virtual
union
of
the
crowns
of
france
and
spain
the
war
was
heartily
supported
from
the
first
by
the
whigs
but
opposed
or
only
languidly
supported
by
the
tories
a
successful
war
is
always
popular
and
strengthens
the
party
that
favours
it
most
accordingly
through
the
earlier
years
of
the
reign
when
the
english
general
marlborough
was
winning
his
famous
victories
the
whigs
had
everything
their
own
way
and
by
the
government
was
entirely
in
their
hands
but
as
the
war
however
successful
seemed
no
nearer
ending
and
its
burdens
began
to
press
more
heavily
tory
opposition
strengthened
and
party
feeling
grew
more
and
more
intense
the
financial
load
fell
mostly
on
the
tory
or
landed
class
for
as
the
tories
said
so
soon
as
ever
a
trading
whig
could
get
a
thousand
pounds
he
put
it
into
government
securities
which
he
had
to
pay
no
tax
upon
while
the
land
had
to
pay
him
a
handsome
rate
of
interest
this
opposition
to
the
whigs
strengthened
by
a
feeling
that
the
cause
of
the
church
and
of
religion
was
endangered
by
whig
supremacy
grew
to
such
volume
that
in
the
memorable
elections
of
the
whigs
were
defeated
and
a
tory
majority
brought
into
the
commons
the
whig
ministers
were
dismissed
marlborough
the
great
general
a
little
later
was
recalled
from
the
army
and
finally
the
queen
took
the
unprecedented
step
of
creating
twelve
new
tory
peers
and
so
making
a
tory
majority
in
the
house
of
lords
also
it
was
in
these
stormy
years
that
appeared
in
the
tumult
of
partisan
controversy
addison
succeeded
in
keeping
his
paper
out
of
the
strife
he
was
a
pronounced
whig
himself
and
his
preferences
are
plainly
enough
to
be
seen
even
in
these
papers
but
he
sincerely
deprecated
the
rancorous
tone
of
party
writing
and
he
wisely
refused
to
allow
to
become
the
organ
of
a
party
steele
had
more
difficulty
in
restraining
his
pen
and
finally
retired
from
rather
than
remain
quiet
on
public
questions
and
the
puritans
during
the
term
of
the
civil
war
were
nicknamed
roundheads
because
they
wore
their
hair
short

does

these

are
full
of
inspiration
and

and
will
be
welcomed
by
every

the
volume
aims
not
at
a
discussion
of

but
at
an
application
of
certain
principles
to
the
teaching
of
some
of
the

most
generally
read

the
references
by

are
to
the

of

the

can
be
used
with
any

are
developed
for
the
general
teaching
of
the
novel

the

and
the

the
suggestions
are
those
of
a
practical
teacher
and
follow
a
definite
scheme
in
each
work
to
be
studied
there
are
discussions
of
methods
topics
for
compositions
and
questions
for
review
the
lists
of

are
by
no

those
that

the
development
of

from

to
the
present
in
a
concise
interesting
and
stimulating
manner
although
the

is

so
clearly

by

the
treatment
is
sufficiently
philosophic
and
suggestive
for
any

beginning
the

the
book
is
a
history
of
literature
and
not
a
mere
collection
of
biographical
sketches
only
enough
of
the
facts
of
an
author
life
are
given
to
make

interested

him
as

to
show
how
his
environment
affected
his
work
each
author
productions
their
relations
to
the
age
and
the
reasons
why
they
hold
a
position
in
literature
receive
adequate
treatment
one
of
the
most
striking
features
of
the
work
consists
in
the
way
in
which
literary
movements
are
clearly
outlined
at
the
beginning
of
each
chapter
special
attention
is
given
to
the
essential
qualities
which
differentiate
one
period
from
another
and
to
the
animating
spirit
of
each
age
the
author
shows
that
each
period
has
contributed
something
definite
to
the
literature
of
england
at
the
end
of
each
chapter
a
carefully
prepared
list
of

is
given

review
in

the
book
is
a
piece
of
work
as
good
of
its
kind
as
any
american
scholar
has
ever
had
in
his
hands
it
is
just
the
kind
of
book
that
should
be
given
to
a
beginner
because
it
will
give
him
a
clear
idea
of
what
to
read
and
of
the
relative
importance
of
the
authors
he
is
to
read
yet
it
is
much
more
than
merely
a
book
for
beginners
any
student
of
the
subject
who
wishes
to
do
good
work
hereafter
must
not
only
read
matthews
book
but
must
largely
adopt
matthews
way
of
looking
at
things
for
these
simply
written
unpretentious
chapters
are
worth
many
times
as
much
as
the
ponderous
tomes
which
contain
what
usually
passes
for
criticism
and
the
principles
upon
which
matthews
insists
with
such
quiet
force
and
good
taste
are
those
which
must
be
adopted
not
only
by
every
student
of
american
writings
but
by
every
american
writer
if
he
is
going
to
do
what
is
really
worth
doing
in
short
matthews
has
produced
an
admirable
book
both
in
manner
and
matter
and
has
made
a
distinct
addition
to
the
very

which
he

wellesley
college
exposition
is
generally
admitted
to
be
the
most
commonly
used
form
of
discourse
and
its
successful
practice
develops
keen
observation
deliberation
sound
critical
judgment
and
clear
and
concise
expression
unfortunately
however
expository
courses
often
fail
to
justify
the
prevailing
estimate
of
the
value
of
exposition
because
the
subject
has
been
presented
in
an
unsystematized
manner
without
variety
or
movement
the
aim
of
this
book
is
to
provide
a
systematized
course
in
the
theory
and
practice
of
expository
writing
the
student
will
acquire
from
its
study
a
clear
understanding
of
exposition
its
nature
its
two
processes
definition
and
analysis
its
three
functions
impersonal

and
interpretative
presentation
and
the
special
application
of
exposition
in

the
volume
includes
an
interesting
section

the
method
used
is
direct

amply
reinforced

the

matter
