timothy
dexter
the
author
of
the
following
curious
and
unique
production
entitled
pickle
for
the
knowing
which
is
here
verbatim
et
spellatim
from
the
original
edition
was
born
in
malden
january
having
served
an
apprenticeship
with
a
leather
dresser
he
commenced
business
in
newburyport
shortly
after
he
was
one
and
twenty
and
being
industrious
and
economical
he
soon
found
himself
in
good
circumstances
in
the
year
he
married
and
receiving
a
considerable
amount
of
money
with
his
wife
he
was
thus
put
in
possession
of
a
moderate
fortune
in
he
had
for
one
of
his
apprentices
the
no
less
eccentric
and
afterwards
the
no
less
noted
jonathan
plumer
travelling
preacher
physician
and
poet
as
he
was
accustomed
to
style
himself
and
of
whom
we
shall
hereafter
speak
in
addition
to
his
regular
business
of
selling
leather
breeches
gloves
soutabel
for
wimen
ware
he
engaged
in
commercial
speculations
and
in
various
kinds
of
business
and
was
unusually
successful
he
traded
with
merchants
and
speculators
in
the
then
province
of
maine
was
engaged
to
some
extent
in
the
west
india
trade
he
also
purchased
a
large
amount
of
what
were
called
state
securities
which
were
eventually
redeemed
at
prices
far
exceeding
their
original
cost
some
of
his
speculations
in
whalebone
and
warming
pans
are
mentioned
by
himself
on
page
of
this
work
thus
in
various
ways
he
added
to
his
property
and
in
a
few
years
he
became
a
wealthy
man
with
wealth
came
the
desire
of
distinction
and
as
his
vanity
was
inordinate
he
spared
no
expence
in
obtaining
the
notoriety
he
sought
in
the
first
place
he
purchased
an
elegant
house
in
high
street
newburyport
and
embellished
it
in
his
peculiar
way
minarets
surmounted
with
golden
balls
were
placed
on
the
roof
a
large
gilt
eagle
was
placed
on
the
top
and
a
great
variety
of
other
ornaments
in
front
of
his
house
and
land
he
caused
to
be
erected
between
forty
and
fifty
wooden
statues
full
length
and
larger
than
life
the
principal
arch
stood
directly
in
front
of
his
door
and
on
this
stood
the
figures
of
washington
adams
and
jefferson
there
were
also
the
statues
of
william
pitt
franklin
bonaparte
george
iv
lord
nelson
morgan
cornplanter
an
indian
chief
jack
tar
traveling
preacher
maternal
affection
two
grenadiers
four
lions
and
one
lamb
and
conspicuous
among
them
were
two
images
of
dexter
himself
one
of
which
held
a
label
with
the
inscription
am
the
first
in
the
east
the
first
in
the
west
and
the
greatest
philosopher
in
the
western
in
order
that
the
interior
of
his
house
should
correspond
with
the
exterior
the
most
costly
furniture
was
imported
from
france
and
the
walls
hung
with
paintings
brought
from
holland
and
other
parts
of
europe
a
library
was
also
provided
but
how
large
or
valuable
we
are
not
able
to
say
an
elegant
coach
with
a
span
of
beautiful
cream
colored
horses
was
procured
on
which
was
painted
his
coat
of
arms
with
the
baronial
supporters
after
the
manner
of
the
english
nobility
with
this
equipage
he
took
the
title
of
lord
dexter
because
as
he
said
it
was
the
voice
of
the
people
at
large
he
was
sometimes
called
the
marquis
of
newburyport
having
completed
the
embelishments
of
his
house
and
gardens
lord
dexter
busied
himself
in
receiving
the
visits
of
the
crowds
who
were
drawn
by
curiosity
to
his
house
his
gardens
were
thrown
open
to
their
inspection
and
he
was
liberal
to
all
the
fame
of
his
hospitality
attracted
as
many
visitors
as
the
fame
of
his
images
to
gratify
his
vanity
he
selected
in
imitation
of
european
princes
a
poet
laureate
this
was
no
other
than
his
former
apprentice
jonathan
plumer
a
native
of
newbury
they
had
once
been
associated
as
master
and
apprentice
but
now
stood
in
the
relation
of
patron
and
poet
from
the
of
plumer
a
very
curious
and
scarce
production
of
pages
the
following
extract
is
taken
which
may
serve
to
give
some
idea
of
the
versatility
of
his
i
had
says
he
some
practice
as
a
physician
and
earned
something
with
my
pen
but
for
several
years
was
obliged
chiefly
to
follow
various
kinds
of
business
accounted
less
honorable
viz
farming
repeating
select
passages
from
authors
selling
halibut
sawing
wood
selling
books
and
ballads
in
the
streets
serving
as
post
boy
filling
beds
with
straw
and
wheeling
them
to
the
owners
thereof
collecting
rags
he
had
previously
served
one
or
two
campaigns
as
a
soldier
and
on
his
return
from
the
wars
he
taught
school
for
some
time
in
new
hampshire
the
ballads
which
he
hawked
about
were
generally
his
own
composition
every
horrid
accident
bloody
murder
a
shipwreck
or
any
other
dreadful
catastrophe
was
sure
to
be
followed
by
a
statement
of
the
facts
a
sermon
and
a
poem
in
the
capacity
of
ballad
maker
and
monger
he
attracted
the
notice
of
dexter
in
whose
service
he
entered
for
a
small
salary
as
poet
laureate
he
wore
a
livery
consisting
of
a
black
frock
coat
adorned
with
stars
and
fringes
a
cocked
hat
and
black
breeches
he
was
crowned
in
the
garden
of
his
patron
with
a
wreath
of
parsley
instead
of
laurel
but
the
ceremony
was
interrupted
before
its
completion
by
a
mob
of
boys
and
both
patron
and
poet
put
to
flight
one
specimen
of
his
laudatory
verses
may
be
seen
on
page
of
this
work
which
will
give
the
reader
some
idea
of
his
qualifications
for
the
office
to
which
he
was
elected
how
well
he
was
satisfied
with
the
praises
of
the
poet
we
are
not
informed
but
feeling
probably
that
no
person
but
himself
could
do
justice
to
the
ideas
which
he
wished
to
present
to
the
public
he
commenced
writing
for
the
press
several
of
these
effusions
were
printed
in
the
the
larger
part
of
them
written
at
different
times
are
embodied
in
the
present
work
a
large
edition
of
which
was
published
by
himself
and
given
away
in
this
edition
not
a
stop
or
a
mark
was
used
in
any
line
of
his
writings
but
in
the
second
edition
one
entire
page
was
filled
with
stops
and
marks
with
a
recommendation
from
the
author
to
his
readers
to
use
them
where
they
were
wanted
in
the
work
or
in
his
own
language
to
peper
and
soolt
it
as
they
pleased
dexter
had
two
children
samuel
and
nancy
neither
of
whom
was
distinguished
for
strength
of
intellect
the
son
was
a
dissipated
prodigal
and
died
young
the
daughter
of
whom
mention
is
made
by
the
father
in
the
following
pages
was
married
to
abraham
bishop
of
new
haven
who
we
are
informed
treated
her
with
neglect
and
cruelty
a
divorce
followed
and
she
became
intemperate
lost
what
little
reason
she
had
and
is
still
living
a
wretched
object
lord
dexter
himself
if
we
may
judge
from
his
own
writings
and
from
what
we
have
heard
was
not
happy
in
his
domestic
relations
he
complains
much
of
his
wife
whom
he
calls
the
gost
and
charges
the
cause
of
his
separation
from
her
for
thirteen
years
to
his
son
bishop
his
own
temper
was
irascible
and
several
stories
are
told
of
the
excesses
into
which
it
would
sometimes
lead
him
he
ordered
his
painter
babson
to
place
the
word
constitution
on
the
scroll
in
the
hand
of
the
figure
of
jefferson
which
the
latter
knowing
the
artist
designed
it
to
represent
the
declaration
of
independence
refused
to
do
dexter
was
so
incensed
by
this
refusal
that
he
went
into
the
house
and
brought
out
a
pistol
which
he
deliberately
fired
at
the
painter
but
he
was
a
poor
shot
and
the
ball
missing
its
object
entered
the
side
of
the
house
at
another
time
seeing
a
countryman
as
he
thought
rather
impudently
viewing
his
premises
he
ordered
his
son
to
fire
at
the
stranger
he
refused
to
do
so
when
the
father
threatened
to
shoot
him
unless
he
complied
his
son
then
obeyed
the
stranger
escaped
unhurt
but
entered
a
complaint
and
lord
timothy
was
in
consequence
sentenced
to
the
house
of
correction
for
several
months
he
went
thither
in
his
own
coach
priding
himself
on
being
the
first
man
who
had
been
to
the
county
house
in
his
own
carriage
drawn
by
two
splendid
horses
he
soon
grew
tired
however
of
his
confinement
and
procured
a
release
which
it
was
said
cost
him
a
thousand
dollars
the
individual
who
exercised
most
influence
over
dexter
was
a
negro
woman
named
lucy
lancaster
or
as
she
was
commonly
called
black
luce
a
woman
of
uncommon
strength
of
mind
great
shrewdness
and
remarkable
for
her
powers
of
memory
and
knowledge
of
human
nature
but
as
wicked
as
she
was
sagacious
she
thought
him
an
honest
man
and
not
so
deficient
in
intellect
as
many
people
supposed
and
attributed
his
eccentricities
to
an
excess
of
animal
this
was
probably
to
some
extent
true
though
it
is
certain
that
other
spirits
contributed
in
no
small
degree
to
the
excesses
of
his
temper
and
the
peculiarities
of
his
taste
he
was
addicted
to
drunkenness
and
with
his
son
and
other
companions
kept
up
his
revels
in
the
best
apartments
of
his
house
by
which
in
a
very
short
time
all
his
costly
furniture
was
ruined
or
very
much
injured
not
insensible
that
he
must
share
the
common
lot
dexter
many
years
before
his
death
prepared
himself
a
tomb
it
was
the
basement
story
of
his
magnificently
fitted
and
open
to
the
light
of
day
his
coffin
made
of
the
best
mahogany
which
he
could
find
superbly
lined
and
adorned
with
silver
handles
he
kept
in
a
room
of
the
house
and
took
great
pleasure
in
exhibiting
it
to
visitors
at
other
times
it
was
locked
up
soon
after
his
death
apparatus
was
prepared
dexter
got
up
a
mock
funeral
which
with
all
but
his
family
and
a
few
associates
was
to
pass
as
real
various
people
in
the
town
were
invited
by
card
who
came
and
found
the
family
clad
in
mourning
and
preparations
for
the
funeral
going
forward
the
burial
service
was
read
by
a
wag
who
then
pronounced
a
bombastic
eulogy
upon
the
deceased
the
mourners
moved
in
procession
to
the
tomb
in
the
garden
the
coffin
was
deposited
and
they
returned
to
the
large
hall
where
a
sumptuous
entertainment
was
provided
while
the
feast
was
going
on
a
loud
noise
attracted
the
guests
to
the
kitchen
where
they
beheld
the
arisen
lord
caning
his
wife
for
not
having
shed
a
tear
during
the
ceremony
he
entered
the
hall
with
the
astonished
mourners
in
high
spirits
joined
in
the
rout
threw
money
from
the
window
to
the
crowd
of
boys
and
expressed
his
satisfaction
with
every
thing
except
the
indifference
of
his
wife
and
the
silence
of
the
bells
lord
dexter
died
at
his
house
on
the
of
october
in
his
year
and
by
direction
of
the
board
of
health
his
remains
were
interred
in
the
common
burying
place
his
grave
is
marked
by
a
simple
stone
the
dexter
mansion
is
yet
standing
and
is
a
very
fine
tenement
but
retains
few
traces
of
the
whims
of
its
late
proprietor
of
the
images
upwards
of
forty
in
number
only
the
three
presidents
now
remain
the
others
having
been
cast
down
by
the
resistless
hand
of
time
some
of
them
were
blown
down
in
the
great
gale
of
september
and
were
sold
at
auction
the
cut
fronting
the
biography
gives
a
very
excellent
and
faithful
representation
of
lord
dexter
in
his
walking
habits
and
the
likeness
of
the
dog
is
equally
perfect
the
dog
was
perfectly
black
and
the
skin
as
entirely
free
from
hair
as
that
of
an
elephant
he
differed
as
much
from
other
dogs
as
did
his
master
and
his
friend
the
poet
differ
from
other
people
the
likenesses
of
all
three
were
drawn
with
great
accuracy
by
james
aiken
esq
now
a
resident
of
philadelphia
and
could
the
patron
and
the
poet
be
seen
in
proper
person
dressed
in
the
costume
of
that
day
they
would
be
objects
of
great
curiosity
but
they
are
gone
and
of
each
it
may
be
truly
said
we
shall
look

i

to
whom
it
may
concern
to
the
majesty
of
the
people
of
newburyport
greeting
it
costs
eight
hundred
dollars
a
year
to
support
a
watch
in
this
town
and
yer
gentlemen
windows
are
broken
fences
pulled
down
and
cellars
broken
open
and
much
other
misdemeanors
done
at
night
are
the
watch
asleep
or
are
they
afraid
to
detect
those
who
are
guilty
of
such
practises
boast
not
of
it
if
you
call
this
liberty
and
equality
newburyport
has
had
the
name
of
being
a
very
civil
worthy
place
it
is
a
great
pity
some
bad
boys
or
young
men
should
disgrace
it
i
hope
our
worthy
and
honorable
rulers
will
bring
those
rude
lads
to
see
themselves
and
lick
the
dust
like
serpents
and
ask
forgiveness
of
their
betters
and
do
so
no
more
but
repent
and
live
now
fellow
citizens
is
it
wisdom
is
it
policy
to
use
a
man
or
men
so
shocking
bad
as
to
oblige
them
to
leave
the
town
where
they
paid
one
dollar
a
day
to
support
government
a
friend
to
good
order
honor
to
whom
it
belongs
to
great
men
a
friend
to
all
good
citizens
and
honest
men
good
bye
whereas
many
philosophers
has
judged
or
guessed
at
many
things
about
this
world
and
so
on
now
i
suppose
i
may
guess
as
it
is
guessing
times
i
guess
the
world
is
one
very
large
living
creature
and
always
was
and
always
will
be
without
any
end
from
everlasting
to
everlasting
and
no
end
what
grows
on
this
large
creature
is
trees
and
many
other
things
in
the
room
of
hair
the
rocks
is
moulds
this
is
called
land
where
the
hair
grows
the
belly
the
sea
all
kinds
of
fish
is
the
worms
in
the
belly
this
large
body
wants
dressing
to
get
our
living
of
this
creature
and
by
industry
we
get
a
living
we
and
all
the
animal
creation
is
less
than
fleas
in
comparison
on
the
back
or
belly
of
this
very
large
immense
body
among
the
hairs
to
work
this
great
body
is
that
of
nature
past
finding
all
we
know
is
we
are
here
we
come
into
the
world
crying
and
go
out
groaning
mankind
is
the
master
beast
on
the
earth
in
the
sea
the
whale
is
the
head
fish
the
minim
is
the
smallest
fish
the
great
fish
eat
up
the
little
ones
and
so
not
only
destroy
one
another
but
they
are
master
over
the
whole
of
beasts
and
fish
even
over
a
lion
therefore
man
is
the
masterly
beast
and
the
worst
of
the
whole
they
know
the
most
and
act
the
worst
according
to
what
they
know
seeing
mankind
so
bad
by
nature
i
think
when
the
candle
goes
out
men
and
women
is
done
they
will
lay
as
dirt
or
rocks
till
the
great
gun
fires
and
when
that
goes
off
the
gun
will
be
so
large
that
the
gun
will
contain
nine
hundred
million
tons
of
the
best
of
good
powder
then
that
will
shake
and
bring
all
the
bones
together
then
the
world
will
be
to
an
end
all
kinds
of
music
will
be
going
on
funding
systems
will
be
laid
aside
the
melody
will
be
very
great
now
why
cant
you
all
believe
the
above
written
as
well
as
many
other
things
to
be
true
as
well
as
what
was
set
forth
in
the
last
centinel
concerning
digging
up
a
frog
twenty
five
feet
below
the
surface
where
it
was
most
as
hard
as
a
rock
there
was
his
shape
like
taking
a
stone
out
of
a
rock
this
is
from
a
minister
now
why
wont
you
believe
me
as
well
wonder
of
wonders
how
great
the
soul
is
do
not
you
all
wonder
admire
to
see
and
behold
and
hear
can
you
all
believe
half
the
truth
and
admire
to
hear
the
wonders
how
great
the
soul
is
only
behold
past
finding
out
only
see
how
large
the
soul
is
that
if
a
man
is
drowned
in
the
sea
what
a
great
bubble
comes
up
out
of
the
top
of
the
water
the
last
of
the
man
dying
under
water
this
is
wind
is
the
soul
that
is
the
last
to
ascend
out
of
the
deep
to
glory
it
is
the
breath
from
on
high
doth
go
on
high
to
glory
the
bubble
is
the
soul

in

of
timothy
dexter
esq
this
great
philosopher
may
indeed
be
styled
a
phenomenon
in
nature
the
many
literary
qualifications
he
possesses
rank
him
foremost
among
literary
that
unequalled
production
from
the
pen
of
this
wonderful
philosopher
denominated
pickle
for
the
knowing
has
not
only
received
universal
applause
and
been
ranked
as
of
the
first
magnitude
in
the
literary
world
but
has
had
such
rapidity
in
its
sale
that
a
copy
can
not
be
procured
though
diligently
sought
after
by
men
of
the
most
transcendant
merit
where
can
we
find
a
man
so
extensively
useful
and
so
eminently
calculated
to
diffuse
light
to
a
dark
and
ignorant
multitude
as
this
rare
philosopher
how
penetrating
his
understanding
how
deep
his
ideas
what
a
multitude
of
discoveries
which
before
were
hid
in
embryo
have
made
their
appearance
at
the
nod
of
his
genius
surely
we
may
say
blessed
are
the
people
who
are
highly
favored
with
the
greatest
luminary
that
ever
gave
light
to
an
existing
world
while
aiming
at
a
just
portrait
of
this
remarkable
naturalist
and
philosopher
his
generosity
is
no
less
a
subject
of
admiration
than
his
literary
and
philosophical
abilities
the
readiness
with
which
his
benevolent
soul
bestows
donations
calls
forth
the
grateful
acknowledgement
of
all
who
have
been
liberally
assisted
from
his
bountiful
hand
see
him
the
first
to
assist
in
building
a
church
for
the
worship
of
god
see
him
liberally
give
for
the
purchase
of
bells
the
ready
cash
without
hesitation
see
him
expending
his
fortune
to
preserve
in
everlasting
romembrance
characters
who
have
shone
with
unexampled
greatness
in
europe
and
america
here
the
subject
fails
vain

may
as
well
attempt
to
stop
the
course
of
nature
as
to
do
ample
justice
to

the
additions

improvements
intended

publishing
the
following
extract
from
a
letter
said
to
be
from
a
trader
among
the
indians
to
a
friend
may
amuse
some
of
your
customers
for
the
a
few
days
ago
one
of
the
indians
paid
me
a
visit
after
some
conversation
he
said
that
a
minister
from
the
united
states
had
been
with
his
tribe
to
teach
them
the
christian
religion
he
says
that
there
is
but
one
only
living
and
true
god
who
is
a
good
wise
and
powerful
spirit
this
indian
say
too
and
that
there
are
three
persons
in
the
god
head
of
one
substance
and
power
god
the
father
god
the
son
and
god
the
holy
ghost
that
the
father
is
of
none
neither
begotten
or
proceeding
the
son
is
eternally
begotten
of
the
father
the
holy
ghost
eternally
proceeding
from
the
father
and
the
son
and
that
the
holy
ghost
visited
a
virgin
and
conveyed
the
son
into
her
where
he
continued
nine
moons
and
then
was
born
like
other
children
was
born
god
and
man
that
when
he
was
about
thirty
years
old
began
to
preach
but
the
great
men
no
like
his
preaching
sent
their
warriors
who
took
and
killed
him
indians
ask
what
all
this
talk
mean
he
say
that
the
first
man
and
woman
broke
god
law
in
eating
what
god
had
forbidden
that
therefore
they
and
all
the
children
that
should
proceed
from
them
must
die
and
be
punished
after
death
forever
that
the
son
came
and
died
to
save
some
of
mankind
from
being
punished
after
death
oh
that
man
could
kill
god
the
son
and
that
his
death
be
of
service
to
mankind
great
many
people
die
before
the
son
of
god
and
did
not
know
any
thing
about
him
it
was
then
asked
whether
his
dying
would
do
poor
indians
any
good
he
say
yes
if
they
believe
then
me
say
that
pappoose
no
believe
them
do
no
good
he
say
you
must
leave
that
with
god
and
believe
for
yourself
one
say
it
is
hard
to
believe
such
if
indian
tell
such
things
the
white
people
no
believe
um
curious
sermon
by
the
rev
hyberdin
which
he
made
at
the
request
of
certain
thieves
that
robbed
him
on
a
hill
near
hartlgrow
in
hampshire
england
in
their
presence
and
at
that
i
greatly
marvel
that
any
man
will
disgrace
thieving
and
think
that
the
doers
thereof
are
worthy
of
death
considering
it
as
a
thing
that
cometh
near
unto
virtue
being
used
in
all
countries
and
allowed
by
god
himself
the
thing
which
i
can
not
compendiously
show
unto
you
at
so
short
a
warning
and
on
so
sharp
an
occasion
i
must
desire
you
gentle
audience
of
thieves
to
take
in
good
part
what
at
this
time
cometh
into
my
mind
not
doubting
but
that
you
through
your
good
knowledge
are
able
to
add
much
more
unto
it
than
this
which
i
shall
now
offer
unto
you
first
fortitude
and
stoutness
of
courage
and
also
boldness
of
mind
is
commended
of
some
men
to
be
a
virtue
which
being
granted
who
is
there
then
that
will
not
judge
thieves
to
be
virtuous
for
they
are
of
all
men
the
most
stout
and
hardy
and
the
most
void
of
fear
for
thieving
is
a
thing
usual
among
all
men
for
not
only
you
that
are
here
present
but
also
many
others
in
divers
places
both
men
women
and
children
rich
and
poor
are
daily
of
the
faculty
as
the
hangman
at
newgate
can
testify
and
that
it
is
allowed
of
by
god
himself
is
evident
from
scripture
for
if
you
examine
the
whole
course
of
the
bible
you
will
find
that
thieves
have
been
beloved
of
god
for
jacob
when
he
came
out
of
mesopotamia
did
steal
his
uncle
laban
kids
the
same
jacob
did
also
steal
his
brother
esau
blessing
and
yet
god
said
have
chosen
jacob
and
refused
the
children
of
israel
when
they
came
out
of
egypt
did
steal
the
egyptian
jewels
of
silver
and
jewels
of
gold
as
god
commanded
them
to
do
david
in
the
days
of
abiathar
the
high
priest
came
into
the
temple
and
stole
the
hallowed
bread
and
yet
god
said
david
is
a
man
after
my
own
heart
christ
himself
when
he
was
here
on
earth
did
take
an
ass
and
colt
that
was
none
of
his
and
yet
god
said
this
is
my
beloved
son
in
whom
i
am
well
pleased
you
see
that
god
delighted
in
but
most
of
all
i
marvel
that
men
can
despise
thieves
whereas
in
many
points
you
be
like
christ
himself
for
christ
had
no
dwelling
place
no
more
than
you
christ
at
length
was
caught
and
so
will
you
he
went
to
hell
and
so
will
you
in
this
you
differ
from
him
for
he
rose
and
went
into
heaven
so
you
will
never
do
without
god
great
mercy
which
god
grant
you
to
whom
with
the
father
son
and
holy
ghost
be
all
honor
and
glory
for
ever
and
ever
