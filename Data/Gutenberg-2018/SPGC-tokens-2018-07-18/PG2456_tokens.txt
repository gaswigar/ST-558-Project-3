the
history
of
herodotus
book
the
fifth
book
of
the
histories
called
terpsichore
in
the
meantime
those
of
the
persians
who
had
been
left
behind
in
europe
by
dareios
of
whom
megabazos
was
the
commander
had
subdued
the
people
of
perinthos
first
of
the
hellespontians
since
they
refused
to
be
subject
to
dareios
these
had
in
former
times
also
been
hardly
dealt
with
by
the
paionians
for
the
paionians
from
the
strymon
had
been
commanded
by
an
oracle
of
their
god
to
march
against
the
perinthians
and
if
the
perinthians
when
encamped
opposite
to
them
should
shout
aloud
and
call
to
them
by
their
name
they
were
to
attack
them
but
if
they
should
not
shout
to
them
they
were
not
to
attack
them
and
thus
the
paionians
proceeded
to
do
now
when
the
perinthians
were
encamped
opposite
to
them
in
the
suburb
of
their
city
a
challenge
was
made
and
a
single
combat
took
place
in
three
different
forms
for
they
matched
a
man
against
a
man
and
a
horse
against
a
horse
and
a
dog
against
a
dog
then
as
the
perinthians
were
getting
the
better
in
two
of
the
three
in
their
exultation
they
raised
a
shout
of
paion
and
the
paionians
conjectured
that
this
was
the
very
thing
which
was
spoken
of
in
the
oracle
and
said
doubtless
to
one
another
now
surely
the
oracle
is
being
accomplished
for
us
now
it
is
time
for
us
to
act
so
the
paionians
attacked
the
perinthians
when
they
had
raised
the
shout
of
paion
and
they
had
much
the
better
in
the
fight
and
left
but
few
of
them
alive
thus
it
happened
with
respect
to
those
things
which
had
been
done
to
them
in
former
times
by
the
paionians
and
at
this
time
although
the
perinthians
proved
themselves
brave
men
in
defence
of
their
freedom
the
persians
and
megabazos
got
the
better
of
them
by
numbers
then
after
perinthos
had
been
conquered
megabazos
marched
his
army
through
the
length
of
thracia
forcing
every
city
and
every
race
of
those
who
dwell
there
to
submit
to
the
king
for
so
it
had
been
commanded
him
by
dareios
to
subdue
thracia
now
the
thracian
race
is
the
most
numerous
except
the
indians
in
all
the
world
and
if
it
should
come
to
be
ruled
over
by
one
man
or
to
agree
together
in
one
it
would
be
irresistible
in
fight
and
the
strongest
by
far
of
all
nations
in
my
opinion
since
however
this
is
impossible
for
them
and
can
not
ever
come
to
pass
among
them
they
are
in
fact
weak
for
that
reason
they
have
many
names
belonging
to
their
various
tribes
in
different
places
but
they
all
follow
customs
which
are
nearly
the
same
in
all
respects
except
the
getai
and
trausians
and
those
who
dwell
above
the
crestonians
of
these
the
practices
of
the
getai
who
believe
themselves
to
be
immortal
have
been
spoken
of
by
me
already
and
the
trausians
perform
everything
else
in
the
same
manner
as
the
other
thracians
but
in
regard
to
those
who
are
born
and
die
among
them
they
do
as
follows
when
a
child
has
been
born
the
nearest
of
kin
sit
round
it
and
make
lamentation
for
all
the
evils
of
which
he
must
fulfil
the
measure
now
that
he
is
born
enumerating
the
whole
number
of
human
ills
but
when
a
man
is
dead
they
cover
him
up
in
the
earth
with
sport
and
rejoicing
saying
at
the
same
time
from
what
great
evils
he
has
escaped
and
is
now
in
perfect
bliss
those
who
dwell
above
the
crestonians
do
as
follows
each
man
has
many
wives
and
when
any
man
of
them
is
dead
a
great
competition
takes
place
among
his
wives
with
much
exertion
on
the
part
of
their
friends
about
the
question
of
which
of
them
was
most
loved
by
their
husband
and
she
who
is
preferred
by
the
decision
and
so
honoured
is
first
praised
by
both
men
and
women
then
her
throat
is
cut
over
the
tomb
by
her
nearest
of
kin
and
afterwards
she
is
buried
together
with
her
husband
and
the
others
are
exceedingly
grieved
at
it
for
this
is
counted
as
the
greatest
reproach
to
them
of
the
other
thracians
the
custom
is
to
sell
their
children
to
be
carried
away
out
of
the
country
and
over
their
maidens
they
do
not
keep
watch
but
allow
them
to
have
commerce
with
whatever
men
they
please
but
over
their
wives
they
keep
very
great
watch
and
they
buy
their
wives
for
great
sums
of
money
from
their
parents
to
be
pricked
with
figures
is
accounted
a
mark
of
noble
rank
and
not
to
be
so
marked
is
a
sign
of
low
birth
not
to
work
is
counted
most
honourable
and
to
be
a
worker
of
the
soil
is
above
all
things
dishonourable
to
live
on
war
and
plunder
is
the
most
honourable
thing
these
are
their
most
remarkable
customs
and
of
the
gods
they
worship
only
ares
and
dionysos
and
artemis
their
kings
however
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
people
worship
hermes
more
than
all
gods
and
swear
by
him
alone
and
they
say
that
they
are
descended
from
hermes
the
manner
of
burial
for
the
rich
among
them
is
this
for
three
days
they
expose
the
corpse
to
view
and
they
slay
all
kinds
of
victims
and
feast
having
first
made
lamentation
then
they
perform
the
burial
rites
either
consuming
the
body
with
fire
or
covering
it
up
in
the
earth
without
burning
and
afterwards
when
they
have
heaped
up
a
mound
they
celebrate
games
with
every
kind
of
contest
in
which
reasonably
the
greatest
prizes
are
assigned
for
single
combat
this
is
the
manner
of
burial
among
the
thracians
of
the
region
lying
further
on
towards
the
north
of
this
country
no
one
can
declare
accurately
who
the
men
are
who
dwell
in
it
but
the
parts
which
lie
immediately
beyond
the
ister
are
known
to
be
uninhabited
and
vast
in
extent
the
only
men
of
whom
i
can
hear
who
dwell
beyond
the
ister
are
those
who
are
said
to
be
called
sigynnai
and
who
use
the
median
fashion
of
dress
their
horses
it
is
said
have
shaggy
hair
all
over
their
bodies
as
much
as
five
fingers
long
and
these
are
small
and
and
too
weak
to
carry
men
but
when
yoked
in
chariots
they
are
very
therefore
the
natives
of
the
country
drive
chariots
the
boundaries
of
this
people
extend
it
is
said
to
the
parts
near
the
enetoi
who
live
on
the
adriatic
and
people
say
that
they
are
colonists
from
the
medes
in
what
way
however
these
have
come
to
be
colonists
from
the
medes
i
am
not
able
for
my
part
to
conceive
but
everything
is
possible
in
the
long
course
of
ages
however
that
may
be
the
ligurians
who
dwell
in
the
region
inland
above
massalia
call
traders
sigynnai
and
the
men
of
cyprus
give
the
same
name
to
spears
now
the
thracians
say
that
the
other
side
of
the
ister
is
occupied
by
bees
and
that
by
reason
of
them
it
is
not
possible
to
pass
through
and
proceed
further
but
to
me
it
seems
that
when
they
so
speak
they
say
that
which
is
not
probable
for
these
creatures
are
known
to
be
intolerant
of
cold
and
to
me
it
seems
that
the
regions
which
go
up
towards
the
pole
are
uninhabitable
by
reason
of
the
cold
climate
these
then
are
the
tales
reported
about
this
country
and
however
that
may
be
megabazos
was
then
making
the
of
it
subject
to
the
persians
meanwhile
dareios
so
soon
as
he
had
crossed
over
the
hellespont
and
come
to
sardis
called
to
mind
the
service
rendered
to
him
by
histiaios
the
milesian
and
also
the
advice
of
the
mytilenian
coës
and
having
sent
for
them
to
come
to
sardis
he
offered
them
a
choice
of
rewards
histiaios
then
being
despot
of
miletos
did
not
make
request
for
any
government
in
addition
to
that
but
he
asked
for
the
district
of
myrkinos
which
belonged
to
the
edonians
desiring
there
to
found
a
city
histiaios
chose
this
for
himself
but
coës
not
being
a
despot
but
a
man
of
the
people
asked
to
be
made
despot
of
mitylene
after
the
desires
of
both
had
been
fulfilled
they
betook
themselves
to
that
which
they
had
chosen
and
at
this
same
time
it
chanced
that
dareios
saw
a
certain
thing
which
made
him
desire
to
command
megabazos
to
conquer
the
paionians
and
remove
them
forcibly
from
europe
into
asia
and
the
thing
was
this
there
were
certain
paionians
named
pigres
and
mantyas
who
when
dareios
had
crossed
over
into
asia
came
to
sardis
because
they
desired
themselves
to
have
rule
over
the
paionians
and
with
them
they
brought
their
sister
who
was
tall
and
comely
then
having
watched
for
a
time
when
dareios
took
his
seat
publicly
in
the
suburb
of
the
lydian
city
they
dressed
up
their
sister
in
the
best
way
they
could
and
sent
her
to
fetch
water
having
a
upon
her
head
and
leading
a
horse
after
her
by
a
bridle
round
her
arm
and
at
the
same
time
spinning
flax
now
when
the
woman
passed
out
of
the
city
by
him
dareios
paid
attention
to
the
matter
for
that
which
was
done
by
the
woman
was
not
of
persian
nor
yet
of
lydian
fashion
nor
indeed
after
the
manner
of
any
people
of
asia
he
sent
therefore
some
of
his
spearmen
bidding
them
watch
what
the
woman
would
do
with
the
horse
they
accordingly
followed
after
her
and
she
having
arrived
at
the
river
watered
the
horse
and
having
watered
him
and
filled
her
jar
with
the
water
she
passed
along
by
the
same
way
bearing
the
water
upon
her
head
leading
the
horse
after
her
by
a
bridle
round
her
arm
and
at
the
same
time
turning
the
spindle
then
dareios
marvelling
both
at
that
which
he
heard
from
those
who
went
to
observe
and
also
at
that
which
he
saw
himself
bade
them
bring
her
into
his
presence
and
when
she
was
brought
her
brothers
also
came
who
had
been
watching
these
things
at
no
great
distance
off
so
then
when
dareios
asked
of
what
country
she
was
the
young
men
said
that
they
were
paionians
and
that
she
was
their
sister
and
he
replied
who
then
are
these
paionians
and
where
upon
the
earth
do
they
dwell
and
he
asked
them
also
what
they
desired
that
they
had
come
to
sardis
they
declared
to
him
that
they
had
come
to
give
themselves
up
to
him
and
that
paionia
was
a
country
situated
upon
the
river
strymon
and
that
the
strymon
was
not
far
from
the
hellespont
and
finally
that
they
were
colonists
from
the
teucrians
of
troy
all
these
things
severally
they
told
him
and
he
asked
whether
all
the
women
of
that
land
were
as
industrious
as
their
sister
and
they
very
readily
replied
to
this
also
saying
that
it
was
so
for
it
was
with
a
view
to
that
very
thing
that
they
had
been
doing
this
then
dareios
wrote
a
letter
to
megabazos
whom
he
had
left
to
command
his
army
in
thrace
bidding
him
remove
the
paionians
from
their
place
of
habitation
and
bring
them
to
the
king
both
themselves
and
their
children
and
their
wives
then
forthwith
a
horseman
set
forth
to
ride
in
haste
bearing
the
message
to
the
hellespont
and
having
passed
over
to
the
other
side
he
gave
the
paper
to
megabazos
so
he
having
read
it
and
having
obtained
guides
from
thrace
set
forth
to
march
upon
paionia
and
the
paionians
being
informed
that
the
persians
were
coming
against
them
gathered
all
their
powers
together
and
marched
out
in
the
direction
of
the
sea
supposing
that
the
persians
when
they
invaded
them
would
make
their
attack
on
that
side
the
paionians
then
were
prepared
as
i
say
to
drive
off
the
army
of
megabazos
when
it
came
against
them
but
the
persians
hearing
that
the
paionians
had
gathered
their
powers
and
were
guarding
the
entrance
which
lay
towards
the
sea
directed
their
course
with
guides
along
the
upper
road
and
passing
unperceived
by
the
paionians
they
fell
upon
their
cities
which
were
left
without
men
and
finding
them
without
defenders
they
easily
took
possession
of
them
the
paionians
when
they
heard
that
their
cities
were
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
at
once
dispersed
each
tribe
to
its
own
place
of
abode
and
proceeded
to
deliver
themselves
up
to
the
persians
thus
then
it
happened
that
these
tribes
of
the
paionians
namely
the
siropaionians
the
paioplians
and
all
up
to
the
lake
prasias
were
removed
from
their
place
of
habitation
and
brought
to
asia
but
those
who
dwell
about
mount
pangaion
and
about
the
doberians
and
agrianians
and
odomantians
and
about
the
lake
prasias
itself
were
not
conquered
at
all
by
megabazos
he
tried
however
to
remove
even
those
who
lived
in
the
lake
and
who
had
their
dwellings
in
the
following
manner
a
platform
fastened
together
and
resting
upon
lofty
piles
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
water
of
the
lake
with
a
narrow
approach
to
it
from
the
mainland
by
a
single
bridge
the
piles
which
supported
the
platform
were
no
doubt
originally
set
there
by
all
the
members
of
the
community
working
together
but
since
that
time
they
continue
to
set
them
by
observance
of
this
rule
that
is
to
say
every
man
who
marries
brings
from
the
mountain
called
orbelos
three
piles
for
each
wife
and
sets
them
as
supports
and
each
man
takes
to
himself
many
wives
and
they
have
their
dwelling
thus
that
is
each
man
has
possession
of
a
hut
upon
the
platform
in
which
he
lives
and
of
a
leading
through
the
platform
down
to
the
lake
and
their
infant
children
they
tie
with
a
rope
by
the
foot
for
fear
that
they
should
roll
into
the
water
to
their
horses
and
beasts
of
burden
they
give
fish
for
fodder
and
of
fish
there
is
so
great
quantity
that
if
a
man
open
the
and
let
down
an
empty
basket
by
a
cord
into
the
lake
after
waiting
quite
a
short
time
he
draws
it
up
again
full
of
fish
of
the
fish
there
are
two
kinds
and
they
call
them
paprax
and
tilon
so
then
those
of
the
paionians
who
had
been
conquered
were
being
brought
to
asia
and
megabazos
meanwhile
after
he
had
conquered
the
paionians
sent
as
envoys
to
macedonia
seven
persians
who
after
himself
were
the
men
of
most
repute
in
the
army
these
were
being
sent
to
amyntas
to
demand
of
him
earth
and
water
for
dareios
the
king
now
from
lake
prasias
there
is
a
very
short
way
into
macedonia
for
first
quite
close
to
the
lake
there
is
the
mine
from
which
after
this
time
there
came
in
regularly
a
talent
of
silver
every
day
to
alexander
and
after
the
mine
when
you
have
passed
over
the
mountain
called
dysoron
you
are
in
macedonia
these
persians
then
who
had
been
sent
to
amyntas
having
arrived
came
into
the
presence
of
amyntas
and
proceeded
to
demand
earth
and
water
for
king
dareios
this
he
was
willing
to
give
and
also
he
invited
them
to
be
his
guests
and
he
prepared
a
magnificent
dinner
and
received
the
persians
with
friendly
hospitality
then
when
dinner
was
over
the
persians
while
drinking
pledges
to
one
another
said
thus
macedonian
it
is
the
custom
among
us
persians
when
we
set
forth
a
great
dinner
then
to
bring
in
also
our
concubines
and
lawful
wives
to
sit
beside
us
do
thou
then
since
thou
didst
readily
receive
us
and
dost
now
entertain
us
magnificently
as
thy
guests
and
since
thou
art
willing
to
give
to
king
dareios
earth
and
water
consent
to
follow
our
custom
to
this
amyntas
replied
persians
among
us
the
custom
is
not
so
but
that
men
should
be
separate
from
women
since
however
ye
being
our
masters
make
this
request
in
addition
this
also
shall
be
given
you
having
so
said
amyntas
proceeded
to
send
for
the
women
and
when
they
came
being
summoned
they
sat
down
in
order
opposite
to
the
persians
then
the
persians
seeing
women
of
comely
form
spoke
to
amyntas
and
said
that
this
which
had
been
done
was
by
no
means
well
devised
for
it
was
better
that
the
women
should
not
come
at
all
than
that
they
should
come
and
should
not
seat
themselves
by
their
side
but
sit
opposite
and
be
a
pain
to
their
eyes
so
amyntas
being
compelled
bade
them
sit
by
the
side
of
the
persians
and
when
the
women
obeyed
forthwith
the
persians
being
much
intoxicated
began
to
touch
their
breasts
and
some
no
doubt
also
tried
to
kiss
them
amyntas
seeing
this
kept
quiet
notwithstanding
that
he
felt
anger
because
he
excessively
feared
the
persians
but
alexander
the
son
of
amyntas
who
was
present
and
saw
this
being
young
and
without
experience
of
calamity
was
not
able
to
endure
any
longer
but
being
impatient
of
it
he
said
to
amyntas
my
father
do
thou
grant
that
which
thy
age
demands
and
go
away
to
rest
nor
persevere
longer
in
the
drinking
but
i
will
remain
here
and
give
to
our
guests
all
that
is
convenient
on
this
amyntas
understanding
that
alexander
was
intending
to
do
some
violence
said
my
son
i
think
that
i
understand
thy
words
as
the
heat
of
anger
moves
thee
namely
that
thou
desirest
to
send
me
away
and
then
do
some
deed
of
violence
therefore
i
ask
of
thee
not
to
do
violence
to
these
men
that
it
may
not
be
our
ruin
but
endure
to
see
that
which
is
being
done
as
to
my
departure
however
in
that
i
will
do
as
thou
sayest
when
amyntas
after
having
made
of
him
this
request
had
departed
alexander
said
to
the
persians
with
these
women
ye
have
perfect
freedom
guests
to
have
commerce
with
all
if
ye
so
desire
or
with
as
many
of
them
as
ye
will
about
this
matter
ye
shall
be
they
who
give
the
word
but
now
since
already
the
hour
is
approaching
for
you
to
go
to
bed
and
i
see
that
ye
have
well
drunk
let
these
women
go
away
if
so
it
is
pleasing
to
you
to
bathe
themselves
and
when
they
have
bathed
then
receive
them
back
into
your
company
having
so
said
since
the
persians
readily
agreed
he
dismissed
the
women
when
they
had
gone
out
to
the
women
chambers
and
alexander
himself
equipped
men
equal
in
number
to
the
women
and
in
the
dress
of
the
women
and
giving
them
daggers
he
led
them
into
the
and
as
he
led
them
in
he
said
thus
to
the
persians
persians
it
seems
to
me
that
ye
have
been
entertained
with
a
feast
to
which
nothing
was
wanting
for
other
things
as
many
as
we
had
and
moreover
such
as
we
were
able
to
find
out
and
furnish
are
all
supplied
to
you
and
there
is
this
especially
besides
which
is
the
chief
thing
of
all
that
is
we
give
you
freely
in
addition
our
mothers
and
our
sisters
in
order
that
ye
may
perceive
fully
that
ye
are
honoured
by
us
with
that
treatment
which
ye
deserve
and
also
in
order
that
ye
may
report
to
the
king
who
sent
you
that
a
man
of
hellas
ruler
under
him
of
the
macedonians
entertained
you
well
at
board
and
bed
having
thus
said
alexander
caused
a
macedonian
man
in
the
guise
of
a
woman
to
sit
by
each
persian
and
they
when
the
persians
attempted
to
lay
hands
on
them
slew
them
so
these
perished
by
this
fate
both
they
themselves
and
their
company
of
servants
for
there
came
with
them
carriages
and
servants
and
all
the
usual
pomp
of
equipage
and
this
was
all
made
away
with
at
the
same
time
as
they
afterwards
in
no
long
time
a
great
search
was
made
by
the
persians
for
these
men
and
alexander
stopped
them
with
cunning
by
giving
large
sums
of
money
and
his
own
sister
whose
name
was
gygaia
by
giving
i
say
these
things
to
bubares
a
persian
commander
of
those
who
were
searching
for
the
men
who
had
been
killed
alexander
stopped
their
search
thus
the
death
of
these
persians
was
kept
concealed
and
that
these
descendants
of
perdiccas
are
hellenes
as
they
themselves
say
i
happen
to
know
myself
and
not
only
so
but
i
will
prove
in
the
succeeding
history
that
they
are
hellenes
moreover
the
hellanodicai
who
manage
the
games
at
olympia
decided
that
they
were
so
for
when
alexander
wished
to
contend
in
the
games
and
had
descended
for
this
purpose
into
the
arena
the
hellenes
who
were
to
run
against
him
tried
to
exclude
him
saying
that
the
contest
was
not
for
barbarians
to
contend
in
but
for
hellenes
since
however
alexander
proved
that
he
was
of
argos
he
was
judged
to
be
a
hellene
and
when
he
entered
the
contest
of
the
his
lot
came
out
with
that
of
the
first
thus
then
it
happened
with
regard
to
these
things
and
at
the
same
time
megabazos
had
arrived
at
the
hellespont
bringing
with
him
the
paionians
and
thence
after
passing
over
the
straits
he
came
to
sardis
then
since
histiaios
the
milesian
was
already
engaged
in
fortifying
with
a
wall
the
place
which
he
had
asked
and
obtained
from
dareios
as
a
reward
for
keeping
safe
the
bridge
of
boats
this
place
being
that
which
is
called
myrkinos
lying
along
the
bank
of
the
river
strymon
megabazos
having
perceived
that
which
was
being
done
by
histiaios
as
soon
as
he
came
to
sardis
bringing
the
paionians
said
thus
to
dareios
o
king
what
a
thing
is
this
that
thou
hast
done
granting
permission
to
a
hellene
who
is
skilful
and
cunning
to
found
a
city
in
thracia
in
a
place
where
there
is
forest
for
shipbuilding
in
abundance
and
great
quantity
of
wood
for
oars
and
mines
of
silver
and
great
numbers
both
of
hellenes
and
barbarians
living
round
who
when
they
have
obtained
a
leader
will
do
that
which
he
shall
command
them
both
by
day
and
by
night
therefore
stop
this
man
from
doing
so
that
thou
be
not
involved
in
a
domestic
war
and
stop
him
by
sending
for
him
in
a
courteous
manner
but
when
thou
hast
got
him
in
thy
hands
then
cause
that
he
shall
never
again
return
to
the
land
of
the
hellenes
thus
saying
megabazos
easily
persuaded
dareios
who
thought
that
he
was
a
true
prophet
of
that
which
was
likely
to
come
to
pass
and
upon
that
dareios
sent
a
messenger
to
myrkinos
and
said
as
follows
hisiaios
king
dareios
saith
these
things
by
taking
thought
i
find
that
there
is
no
one
more
sincerely
well
disposed
than
thou
art
to
me
and
to
my
power
and
this
i
know
having
learnt
by
deeds
not
words
now
therefore
since
i
have
it
in
my
mind
to
accomplish
great
matters
come
hither
to
me
by
all
means
that
i
may
communicate
them
to
thee
histiaios
therefore
trusting
to
these
sayings
and
at
the
same
time
accounting
it
a
great
thing
to
become
a
counsellor
of
the
king
came
to
sardis
and
when
he
had
come
dareios
spoke
to
him
as
follows
histiaios
i
sent
for
thee
for
this
reason
namely
because
when
i
had
returned
from
the
scythians
and
thou
wert
gone
away
out
of
the
sight
of
my
eyes
never
did
i
desire
to
see
anything
again
within
so
short
a
time
as
i
desired
then
both
to
see
thee
and
that
thou
shouldst
come
to
speech
with
me
since
i
perceived
that
the
most
valuable
of
all
possessions
is
a
friend
who
is
a
man
of
understanding
and
also
sincerely
both
which
qualities
i
know
exist
in
thee
and
i
am
able
to
bear
witness
of
them
in
regard
to
my
affairs
now
therefore
for
thou
didst
well
in
that
thou
camest
hither
this
is
that
which
i
propose
to
thee
leave
miletos
alone
and
also
thy
city
in
thracia
and
coming
with
me
to
susa
have
whatsoever
things
i
have
eating
at
my
table
and
being
my
counseller
thus
said
dareios
and
having
appointed
artaphrenes
his
own
brother
and
the
son
of
his
father
to
be
governor
of
sardis
he
marched
away
to
susa
taking
with
him
histiaios
after
he
had
first
named
otanes
to
be
commander
of
those
who
dwelt
along
the
sea
coasts
this
father
sisamnes
who
had
been
made
one
of
the
royal
judges
king
cambyses
slew
because
he
had
judged
a
cause
unjustly
for
money
and
flayed
off
all
his
skin
then
after
he
had
torn
away
the
skin
he
cut
leathern
thongs
out
of
it
and
stretched
them
across
the
seat
where
sisamnes
had
been
wont
to
sit
to
give
judgment
and
having
stretched
them
in
the
seat
cambyses
appointed
the
son
of
that
sisamnes
whom
he
had
slain
and
flayed
to
be
judge
instead
of
his
father
enjoining
him
to
remember
in
what
seat
he
was
sitting
to
give
judgment
this
otanes
then
who
was
made
to
sit
in
that
seat
had
now
become
the
successor
of
megabazos
in
the
command
and
he
conquered
the
byzantians
and
calchedonians
and
he
conquered
antandros
in
the
land
of
troas
and
lamponion
and
having
received
ships
from
the
lesbians
he
conquered
lemnos
and
imbros
which
were
both
at
that
time
still
inhabited
by
pelasgians
of
these
the
lemnians
fought
well
and
defending
themselves
for
a
long
time
were
at
length
brought
to
ruin
and
over
those
of
them
who
survived
the
persians
set
as
governor
lycaretos
the
brother
of
that
maiandrios
who
had
been
king
of
samos
this
lycaretos
ruled
in
lemnos
till
his
death
and
the
cause
of
it
was
this
he
continued
to
reduce
all
to
slavery
and
subdue
them
accusing
some
of
desertion
to
the
scythians
and
others
of
doing
damage
to
the
army
of
dareios
as
it
was
coming
back
from
scythia
otanes
then
effected
so
much
when
he
was
made
commander
and
after
this
for
a
short
time
there
was
an
abatement
of
evils
and
then
again
evils
began
a
second
time
to
fall
upon
the
ionians
arising
from
naxos
and
miletos
for
naxos
was
superior
to
all
the
other
islands
in
wealth
and
miletos
at
the
same
time
had
just
then
come
to
the
very
height
of
its
prosperity
and
was
the
ornament
of
ionia
but
before
these
events
for
two
generations
of
men
it
had
been
afflicted
most
violently
by
faction
until
the
parians
reformed
it
for
these
the
milesians
chose
of
all
the
hellenes
to
be
reformers
of
their
state
now
the
parians
thus
reconciled
their
factions
the
best
men
of
them
came
to
miletos
and
seeing
that
the
milesians
were
in
a
grievously
ruined
state
they
said
that
they
desired
to
go
over
their
land
and
while
doing
this
and
passing
through
the
whole
territory
of
miletos
whenever
they
saw
in
the
desolation
of
the
land
any
field
that
was
well
cultivated
they
wrote
down
the
name
of
the
owner
of
that
field
then
when
they
had
passed
through
the
whole
land
and
had
found
but
few
of
such
men
as
soon
as
they
returned
to
the
city
they
called
a
general
gathering
and
appointed
these
men
to
manage
the
state
whose
fields
they
had
found
well
cultivated
for
they
said
that
they
thought
these
men
would
take
care
of
the
public
affairs
as
they
had
taken
care
of
their
own
and
the
rest
of
the
milesians
who
before
had
been
divided
by
factions
they
commanded
to
be
obedient
to
these
men
the
parians
then
had
thus
reformed
the
milesians
but
at
the
time
of
which
i
speak
evils
began
to
come
to
ionia
from
these
states
in
the
following
manner
from
naxos
certain
men
of
the
wealthier
class
were
driven
into
exile
by
the
people
and
having
gone
into
exile
they
arrived
at
miletos
now
of
miletos
it
happened
that
aristagoras
son
of
molpagoras
was
ruler
in
charge
being
both
a
and
also
a
cousin
of
histiaios
the
son
of
lysagoras
whom
dareios
was
keeping
at
susa
for
histiaios
was
despot
of
miletos
and
it
happened
that
he
was
at
susa
at
this
time
when
the
naxians
came
who
had
been
in
former
times
of
histiaios
so
when
the
naxians
arrived
they
made
request
of
aristagoras
to
see
if
perchance
he
would
supply
them
with
a
force
and
so
they
might
return
from
exile
to
their
own
land
and
he
thinking
that
if
by
his
means
they
should
return
to
their
own
state
he
would
be
ruler
of
naxos
but
at
the
same
time
making
a
pretext
of
the
of
histiaios
made
proposal
to
them
thus
i
am
not
able
to
engage
that
i
can
supply
you
with
sufficient
force
to
bring
you
back
from
exile
against
the
will
of
those
naxians
who
have
control
of
the
state
for
i
hear
that
the
naxians
have
an
army
which
is
eight
thousand
shields
strong
and
many
ships
of
war
but
i
will
use
every
endeavour
to
devise
a
means
and
my
plan
is
this
it
chances
that
artaphrenes
is
my
friend
now
artaphrenes
ye
must
know
is
a
son
of
hystaspes
and
brother
of
dareios
the
king
and
he
is
ruler
of
all
the
people
of
the
in
asia
with
a
great
army
and
many
ships
this
man
then
i
think
will
do
whatsoever
we
shall
request
of
him
hearing
this
the
naxians
gave
over
the
matter
to
aristagoras
to
manage
as
best
he
could
and
they
bade
him
promise
gifts
and
the
expenses
of
the
expedition
saying
that
they
would
pay
them
for
they
had
full
expectation
that
when
they
should
appear
at
naxos
the
naxians
would
do
all
their
bidding
and
likewise
also
the
other
islanders
for
of
these
islands
that
is
the
cyclades
not
one
was
as
yet
subject
to
dareios
aristagoras
accordingly
having
arrived
at
sardis
said
to
artaphrenes
that
naxos
was
an
island
not
indeed
large
in
size
but
fair
nevertheless
and
of
fertile
soil
as
well
as
near
to
ionia
and
that
there
was
in
it
much
wealth
and
many
slaves
do
thou
therefore
send
an
expedition
against
this
land
and
restore
it
to
those
who
are
now
exiles
from
it
and
if
thou
shalt
do
this
first
i
have
ready
for
thee
large
sums
of
money
apart
from
the
expenses
incurred
for
the
expedition
which
it
is
fair
that
we
who
conduct
it
should
supply
and
next
thou
wilt
gain
for
the
king
not
only
naxos
itself
but
also
the
islands
which
are
dependent
upon
it
paros
and
andros
and
the
others
which
are
called
cyclades
and
setting
out
from
these
thou
wilt
easily
attack
euboea
an
island
which
is
large
and
wealth
as
large
indeed
as
cyprus
and
very
easy
to
conquer
to
subdue
all
these
a
hundred
ships
are
sufficient
he
made
answer
in
these
words
thou
makest
thyself
a
reporter
of
good
things
to
the
house
of
the
king
and
in
all
these
things
thou
advisest
well
except
as
to
the
number
of
the
ships
for
instead
of
one
hundred
there
shall
be
prepared
for
thee
two
hundred
by
the
beginning
of
the
spring
and
it
is
right
that
the
king
himself
also
should
join
in
approving
this
matter
so
aristagoras
hearing
this
went
back
to
miletos
greatly
rejoiced
and
artaphrenes
meanwhile
when
he
had
sent
to
susa
and
communicated
that
which
was
said
by
aristagoras
and
dareios
himself
also
had
joined
in
approving
it
made
ready
two
hundred
triremes
and
a
very
great
multitude
both
of
persians
and
their
allies
and
appointed
to
be
commander
of
these
megabates
a
persian
one
of
the
achaimenidai
and
a
cousin
to
himself
and
to
dareios
to
whose
daughter
afterwards
pausanias
the
son
of
cleombrotus
the
lacedaemonian
at
least
if
the
story
be
true
betrothed
himself
having
formed
a
desire
to
become
a
despot
of
hellas
having
appointed
megabates
i
say
to
be
commander
artaphrenes
sent
away
the
armament
to
aristagoras
so
when
megabates
had
taken
force
together
with
the
naxians
he
sailed
with
the
pretence
of
going
to
the
hellespont
but
when
he
came
to
chios
he
directed
his
ships
to
caucasa
in
order
that
he
might
from
thence
pass
them
over
to
naxos
with
a
north
wind
then
since
it
was
not
fated
that
the
naxians
should
be
destroyed
by
this
expedition
there
happened
an
event
which
i
shall
narrate
as
megabates
was
going
round
to
visit
the
guards
set
in
the
several
ships
it
chanced
that
in
a
ship
of
myndos
there
was
no
one
on
guard
and
he
being
very
angry
bade
his
spearmen
find
out
the
commander
of
the
ship
whose
name
was
skylax
and
bind
him
in
an
of
his
ship
in
such
a
manner
that
his
head
should
be
outside
and
his
body
within
when
skylax
was
thus
bound
some
one
reported
to
aristagoras
that
megabates
had
bound
his
of
myndos
and
was
doing
to
him
shameful
outrage
he
accordingly
came
and
asked
the
persian
for
his
release
and
as
he
did
not
obtain
anything
of
that
which
he
requested
he
went
himself
and
let
him
loose
being
informed
of
this
megabates
was
exceedingly
angry
and
broke
out
in
rage
against
aristagoras
and
he
replied
what
hast
thou
to
do
with
these
matters
did
not
artaphrenes
send
thee
to
obey
me
and
to
sail
whithersoever
i
should
order
why
dost
thou
meddle
with
things
which
concern
thee
not
thus
said
aristagoras
and
the
other
being
enraged
at
this
when
night
came
on
sent
men
in
a
ship
to
naxos
to
declare
to
the
naxians
all
the
danger
that
threatened
them
for
the
naxians
were
not
at
all
expecting
that
this
expedition
would
be
against
them
but
when
they
were
informed
of
it
forthwith
they
brought
within
the
wall
the
property
which
was
in
the
fields
and
provided
for
themselves
food
and
drink
as
for
a
siege
and
strengthened
their
wall
these
then
were
making
preparations
as
for
war
to
come
upon
them
and
the
others
meanwhile
having
passed
their
ships
over
from
chios
to
naxos
found
them
well
defended
when
they
made
their
attack
and
besieged
them
for
four
months
then
when
the
money
which
the
persians
had
brought
with
them
had
all
been
consumed
by
them
and
not
only
that
but
aristagoras
himself
had
spent
much
in
addition
and
the
siege
demanded
ever
more
and
more
they
built
walls
for
the
naxian
exiles
and
departed
to
the
mainland
again
with
ill
success
and
so
aristagoras
was
not
able
to
fulfil
his
promise
to
artaphrenes
and
at
the
same
time
he
was
hard
pressed
by
the
demand
made
to
him
for
the
expenses
of
the
expedition
and
had
fears
because
of
the
ill
success
of
the
armament
and
because
he
had
become
an
enemy
of
megabates
and
he
supposed
that
he
would
be
deprived
of
his
rule
over
miletos
having
all
these
various
fears
he
began
to
make
plans
of
revolt
for
it
happened
also
that
just
at
this
time
the
man
who
had
been
marked
upon
the
head
had
come
from
hisiaios
who
was
at
susa
signifying
that
aristagoras
should
revolt
from
the
king
for
histiaios
desiring
to
signify
to
aristagoras
that
he
should
revolt
was
not
able
to
do
it
safely
in
any
other
way
because
the
roads
were
guarded
but
shaved
off
the
hair
of
the
most
faithful
of
his
slaves
and
having
marked
his
head
by
pricking
it
waited
till
the
hair
had
grown
again
and
as
soon
as
it
was
grown
he
sent
him
away
to
miletos
giving
him
no
other
charge
but
this
namely
that
when
he
should
have
arrived
at
miletos
he
should
bid
aristagoras
shave
his
hair
and
look
at
his
head
and
the
marks
as
i
have
said
before
signified
revolt
this
thing
histiaios
was
doing
because
he
was
greatly
vexed
by
being
detained
at
susa
he
had
great
hopes
then
that
if
a
revolt
occurred
he
would
be
let
go
to
the
but
if
no
change
was
made
at
miletos
he
had
no
expectation
of
ever
returning
thither
again
accordingly
hisiaios
with
this
intention
was
sending
the
messenger
and
it
chanced
that
all
these
things
happened
to
aristagoras
together
at
the
same
time
he
took
counsel
therefore
with
his
partisans
declaring
to
them
both
his
own
opinion
and
the
message
from
hisiaios
and
while
all
the
rest
expressed
an
opinion
to
the
same
effect
urging
him
namely
to
make
revolt
hecataios
the
historian
urged
first
that
they
should
not
undertake
war
with
the
king
of
the
persians
enumerating
all
the
nations
over
whom
dareios
was
ruler
and
his
power
and
when
he
did
not
succeed
in
persuading
him
he
counselled
next
that
they
should
manage
to
make
themselves
masters
of
the
sea
now
this
he
continued
could
not
come
to
pass
in
any
other
way
so
far
as
he
could
see
for
he
knew
that
the
force
of
the
milesians
was
weak
but
if
the
treasures
should
be
taken
which
were
in
the
temple
at
branchidai
which
croesus
the
lydian
dedicated
as
offerings
he
had
great
hopes
that
they
might
become
masters
of
the
sea
and
by
this
means
they
would
not
only
themselves
have
wealth
at
their
disposal
but
the
enemy
would
not
be
able
to
carry
the
things
off
as
plunder
now
these
treasures
were
of
great
value
as
i
have
shown
in
the
first
part
of
the
history
this
opinion
did
not
prevail
but
nevertheless
it
was
resolved
to
make
revolt
and
that
one
of
them
should
sail
to
myus
to
make
the
force
which
had
returned
from
naxos
and
was
then
there
and
endeavour
to
seize
the
commanders
who
sailed
in
the
ships
so
iatragoras
was
sent
for
this
purpose
and
seized
by
craft
oliatos
the
son
of
ibanollis
of
mylasa
and
histiaios
the
son
of
tymnes
of
termera
and
coës
the
son
of
erxander
to
whom
dareios
had
given
mytilene
as
a
gift
and
aristagoras
the
son
of
heracleides
of
kyme
and
many
others
and
then
aristagoras
openly
made
revolt
and
devised
all
that
he
could
to
the
hurt
of
dareios
and
first
he
pretended
to
resign
the
despotic
power
and
give
to
miletos
equality
in
order
that
the
milesians
might
be
willing
to
revolt
with
him
then
afterwards
he
proceeded
to
do
this
same
thing
in
the
rest
of
ionia
also
and
some
of
the
despots
he
drove
out
but
those
whom
he
had
taken
from
the
ships
which
had
sailed
with
him
to
naxis
these
he
surrendered
because
he
desired
to
do
a
pleasure
to
their
cities
delivering
them
over
severally
to
that
city
from
which
each
one
came
now
the
men
of
mitylene
so
soon
as
they
received
coës
into
their
hands
brought
him
out
and
stoned
him
to
death
but
the
men
of
kyme
let
their
despot
go
and
so
also
most
of
the
others
let
them
go
thus
then
the
despots
were
deposed
in
the
various
cities
and
aristagoras
the
milesian
after
having
deposed
the
despots
bade
each
people
appoint
commanders
in
their
several
cities
and
then
himself
set
forth
as
an
envoy
to
lacedemon
for
in
truth
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
find
out
some
powerful
alliance
now
at
sparta
anaxandrides
the
son
of
leon
was
no
longer
surviving
as
king
but
had
brought
his
life
to
an
end
and
cleomenes
the
son
of
anaxandrides
was
holding
the
royal
power
not
having
obtained
it
by
merit
but
by
right
of
birth
for
anaxandrides
had
to
wife
his
own
sister
daughter
and
she
was
by
him
much
beloved
but
no
children
were
born
to
him
by
her
this
being
so
the
ephors
summoned
him
before
them
and
said
if
thou
dost
not
for
thyself
take
thought
in
time
yet
we
can
not
suffer
this
to
happen
that
the
race
of
eurysthenes
should
become
extinct
do
thou
therefore
put
away
from
thee
the
wife
whom
thou
now
hast
since
as
thou
knowest
she
bears
thee
no
children
and
marry
another
and
in
doing
so
thou
wilt
please
the
spartans
he
made
answer
saying
that
he
would
do
neither
of
these
two
things
and
that
they
did
not
give
him
honourable
counsel
in
that
they
advised
him
to
send
away
the
wife
whom
he
had
though
she
had
done
him
no
wrong
and
to
take
to
his
house
another
and
in
short
he
would
not
follow
their
advice
upon
this
the
ephors
and
the
senators
deliberated
together
and
proposed
to
anaxandrides
as
follows
since
then
we
perceive
that
thou
art
firmly
attached
to
the
wife
whom
thou
now
hast
consent
to
do
this
and
set
not
thyself
against
it
lest
the
spartans
take
some
counsel
about
thee
other
than
might
be
wished
we
do
not
ask
of
thee
the
putting
away
of
the
wife
whom
thou
hast
but
do
thou
give
to
her
all
that
thou
givest
now
and
at
the
same
time
take
to
thy
house
another
wife
in
addition
to
this
one
to
bear
thee
children
when
they
spoke
to
him
after
this
manner
anaxandrides
consented
having
two
wives
a
thing
which
was
not
by
any
means
after
the
spartan
fashion
then
when
no
long
time
had
elapsed
the
wife
who
had
come
in
afterwards
bore
this
cleomenes
of
whom
we
spoke
and
just
when
she
was
bringing
to
the
light
an
heir
to
the
kingdom
of
the
spartans
the
former
wife
who
had
during
the
time
before
been
childless
then
by
some
means
conceived
chancing
to
do
so
just
at
that
time
and
though
she
was
in
truth
with
child
the
kinsfolk
of
the
wife
who
had
come
in
afterwards
when
they
heard
of
it
cried
out
against
her
and
said
that
she
was
making
a
vain
boast
and
that
she
meant
to
pass
off
another
child
as
her
own
since
then
they
made
a
great
show
of
indignation
as
the
time
was
fast
drawing
near
the
ephors
being
incredulous
sat
round
and
watched
the
woman
during
the
birth
of
her
child
and
she
bore
dorieos
and
then
straightway
conceived
leonidas
and
after
him
at
once
cleombrotos
nay
some
even
say
that
cleombrotos
and
leonidas
were
twins
the
wife
however
who
had
born
cleomenes
and
had
come
in
after
the
first
wife
being
the
daughter
of
primetades
the
son
of
demarmenos
did
not
bear
a
child
again
now
cleomenes
it
is
said
was
not
quite
in
his
right
senses
but
on
the
verge
of
madness
while
dorieos
was
of
all
his
equals
in
age
the
first
and
felt
assured
that
he
would
obtain
the
kingdom
by
merit
seeing
then
that
he
had
this
opinion
when
anaxandrides
died
and
the
lacedemonians
followed
the
usual
custom
established
the
eldest
namely
cleomenes
upon
the
throne
dorieos
being
indignant
and
not
thinking
it
fit
that
he
should
be
a
subject
of
cleomenes
asked
the
spartans
to
give
him
a
company
of
followers
and
led
them
out
to
found
a
colony
without
either
inquiring
of
the
oracle
at
delphi
to
what
land
he
should
go
to
make
a
settlement
or
doing
any
of
the
things
which
are
usually
done
but
being
vexed
he
sailed
away
with
his
ships
to
libya
and
the
theraians
were
his
guides
thither
then
having
come
to
kinyps
he
made
a
settlement
in
the
fairest
spot
of
all
libya
along
the
banks
of
the
river
but
afterwards
in
the
third
year
he
was
driven
out
from
thence
by
the
macai
and
the
libyans
and
the
carthaginians
and
returned
to
peloponnesus
then
antichares
a
man
of
eleon
gave
him
counsel
out
of
the
oracles
of
laïos
to
make
a
settlement
at
heracleia
in
sicily
saying
that
the
whole
land
of
eryx
belonged
to
the
heracleidai
since
heracles
himself
had
won
it
and
hearing
this
he
went
forthwith
to
delphi
to
inquire
of
the
oracle
whether
he
would
be
able
to
conquer
the
land
to
which
he
was
setting
forth
and
the
pythian
prophetess
replied
to
him
that
he
would
conquer
it
dorieos
therefore
took
with
him
the
armament
which
he
conducted
before
to
libya
and
voyaged
along
the
coast
of
italy
now
at
this
time
the
men
of
sybaris
say
that
they
and
their
king
telys
were
about
to
make
an
expedition
against
croton
and
the
men
of
croton
being
exceedingly
alarmed
asked
dorieos
to
help
them
and
obtained
their
request
so
dorieos
joined
them
in
an
expedition
against
sybaris
and
helped
them
to
conquer
sybaris
this
is
what
the
men
of
sybaris
say
of
the
doings
of
dorieos
and
his
followers
but
those
of
croton
say
that
no
stranger
helped
them
in
the
war
against
the
sybarites
except
callias
alone
a
diviner
of
elis
and
one
of
the
descendants
of
iamos
and
he
in
the
following
manner
he
ran
away
they
say
from
telys
the
despot
of
the
sybarites
when
the
sacrifices
did
not
prove
favourable
as
he
was
sacrificing
for
the
expedition
against
croton
and
so
he
came
to
them
such
i
say
are
the
tales
which
these
tell
and
they
severally
produce
as
evidence
of
them
the
following
facts
the
sybarites
point
to
a
sacred
enclosure
and
temple
by
the
side
of
the
bed
of
the
crathis
which
they
say
that
dorieos
after
he
had
joined
in
the
capture
of
the
city
set
up
to
athene
surnamed
of
the
crathis
and
besides
they
consider
the
death
of
dorieos
himself
to
be
a
very
strong
evidence
thinking
that
he
perished
because
he
acted
contrary
to
the
oracle
which
was
given
to
him
for
if
he
had
not
done
anything
by
the
way
but
had
continued
to
do
that
for
which
he
was
sent
he
would
have
conquered
the
land
of
eryx
and
having
conquered
it
would
have
become
possessor
of
it
and
he
and
his
army
would
not
have
perished
on
the
other
hand
the
men
of
croton
declare
that
many
things
were
granted
in
the
territory
of
croton
as
special
gifts
to
callias
the
eleisan
of
which
the
descendants
of
callias
were
still
in
possession
down
to
my
time
and
that
nothing
was
granted
to
dorieos
or
the
descendants
of
dorieos
but
if
dorieos
had
in
fact
helped
them
in
the
way
with
sybaris
many
times
as
much
they
say
would
have
been
given
to
him
as
to
callias
these
then
are
the
evidences
which
the
two
sides
produce
and
we
may
assent
to
whichever
of
them
we
think
credible
now
there
sailed
with
dorieos
others
also
of
the
spartans
to
be
with
him
of
the
colony
namely
thessalos
and
paraibates
and
keleas
and
euryleon
and
these
when
they
had
reached
sicily
with
all
their
armament
were
slain
being
defeated
in
battle
by
the
phenicians
and
the
men
of
egesta
and
euryleon
only
of
the
survived
this
disaster
this
man
then
having
collected
the
survivors
of
the
expedition
took
possession
of
minoa
the
colony
of
selinus
and
he
helped
to
free
the
men
of
selinus
from
their
despot
peithagoras
afterwards
when
he
had
deposed
him
he
laid
hands
himself
upon
the
despotism
in
selinus
and
became
sole
ruler
there
though
but
for
a
short
time
for
the
men
of
selinus
rose
in
revolt
against
him
and
slew
him
notwithstanding
that
he
had
fled
for
refuge
to
the
altar
of
zeus
agoraios
there
had
accompanied
dorieos
also
and
died
with
him
philip
the
son
of
butakides
a
man
of
croton
who
having
betrothed
himself
to
the
daughter
of
telys
the
sybarite
became
an
exile
from
croton
and
then
being
disappointed
of
this
marriage
he
sailed
away
to
kyrene
whence
he
set
forth
and
accompanied
dorieos
with
a
trireme
of
his
own
himself
supplying
the
expenses
of
the
crew
now
this
man
had
been
a
victor
at
the
olympic
games
and
he
was
the
most
beautiful
of
the
hellenes
who
lived
in
his
time
and
on
account
of
his
beauty
he
obtained
from
the
men
of
egesta
that
which
none
else
ever
obtained
from
them
for
they
established
a
over
his
tomb
and
they
propitiate
him
still
with
sacrifices
in
this
manner
dorieos
ended
his
life
but
if
he
had
endured
to
be
a
subject
of
cleomenes
and
had
remained
in
sparta
he
would
have
been
king
of
lacedemon
for
cleomenes
reigned
no
very
long
time
and
died
leaving
no
son
to
succeed
him
but
a
daughter
only
whose
name
was
gorgo
however
aristagoras
the
despot
of
miletos
arrived
at
sparta
while
cleomenes
was
reigning
and
accordingly
with
him
he
came
to
speech
having
as
the
lacedemonians
say
a
tablet
of
bronze
on
which
was
engraved
a
map
of
the
whole
earth
with
all
the
sea
and
all
the
rivers
and
when
he
came
to
speech
with
cleomenes
he
said
to
him
as
follows
marvel
not
cleomenes
at
my
earnestness
in
coming
hither
for
the
case
is
that
the
sons
of
the
ionians
should
be
slaves
instead
of
free
is
a
reproach
and
a
grief
most
of
all
indeed
to
ourselves
but
of
all
others
most
to
you
inasmuch
as
ye
are
the
leaders
of
hellas
now
therefore
i
entreat
you
by
the
gods
of
hellas
to
rescue
from
slavery
the
ionians
who
are
your
own
kinsmen
and
ye
may
easily
achieve
this
for
the
barbarians
are
not
valiant
in
fight
whereas
ye
have
attained
to
the
highest
point
of
valour
in
that
which
relates
to
war
and
their
fighting
is
of
this
fashion
namely
with
bows
and
arrows
and
a
short
spear
and
they
go
into
battle
wearing
trousers
and
with
caps
on
their
heads
thus
they
are
easily
conquered
then
again
they
who
occupy
that
continent
have
good
things
in
such
quantity
as
not
all
the
other
nations
of
the
world
together
possess
first
gold
then
silver
and
bronze
and
embroidered
garments
and
beasts
of
burden
and
slaves
all
which
ye
might
have
for
yourselves
if
ye
so
desired
and
the
nations
moreover
dwell
in
such
order
one
after
the
other
as
i
shall
declare
the
ionians
here
and
next
to
them
the
lydians
who
not
only
dwell
in
a
fertile
land
but
are
also
exceedingly
rich
in
gold
and
silver
and
as
he
said
this
he
pointed
to
the
map
of
the
earth
which
he
carried
with
him
engraved
upon
the
tablet
and
here
next
to
the
lydians
continued
aristagoras
are
the
eastern
phrygians
who
have
both
the
greatest
number
of
sheep
and
cattle
of
any
people
that
i
know
and
also
the
most
abundant
crops
next
to
the
phrygians
are
the
cappadokians
whom
we
call
syrians
and
bordering
upon
them
are
the
kilikians
coming
down
to
this
sea
in
which
lies
the
island
of
cyprus
here
and
these
pay
five
hundred
talents
to
the
king
for
their
yearly
tribute
next
to
these
kilikians
are
the
armenians
whom
thou
mayest
see
here
and
these
also
have
great
numbers
of
sheep
and
cattle
next
to
the
armenians
are
the
matienians
occupying
this
country
here
and
next
to
them
is
the
land
of
kissia
here
in
which
land
by
the
banks
of
this
river
choaspes
is
situated
that
city
of
susa
where
the
great
king
has
his
residence
and
where
the
money
is
laid
up
in
treasuries
after
ye
have
taken
this
city
ye
may
then
with
good
courage
enter
into
a
contest
with
zeus
in
the
matter
of
wealth
nay
but
can
it
be
that
ye
feel
yourselves
bound
to
take
upon
you
the
risk
of
battles
against
messenians
and
arcadians
and
argives
who
are
equally
matched
against
you
for
the
sake
of
land
which
is
not
much
in
extent
nor
very
fertile
and
for
confines
which
are
but
small
though
these
peoples
have
neither
gold
nor
silver
at
all
for
the
sake
of
which
desire
incites
one
to
fight
and
to
die
can
this
be
i
say
and
will
ye
choose
some
other
way
now
when
it
is
possible
for
you
easily
to
have
the
rule
over
all
asia
aristagoras
spoke
thus
and
cleomenes
answered
him
saying
from
miletos
i
defer
my
answer
to
thee
until
the
day
after
thus
far
then
they
advanced
at
that
time
and
when
the
appointed
day
arrived
for
the
answer
and
they
had
come
to
the
place
agreed
upon
cleomenes
asked
aristagoras
how
many
days
journey
it
was
from
the
sea
of
the
ionians
to
the
residence
of
the
king
now
aristagoras
who
in
other
respects
acted
cleverly
and
imposed
upon
him
well
in
this
point
made
a
mistake
for
whereas
he
ought
not
to
have
told
him
the
truth
at
least
if
he
desired
to
bring
the
spartans
out
to
asia
he
said
in
fact
that
it
was
a
journey
up
from
the
sea
of
three
months
and
the
other
cutting
short
the
rest
of
the
account
which
aristagoras
had
begun
to
give
of
the
way
said
from
miletos
get
thee
away
from
sparta
before
the
sun
has
set
for
thou
speakest
a
word
which
sounds
not
well
in
the
ears
of
the
lacedemonians
desiring
to
take
them
a
journey
of
three
months
from
the
sea
cleomenes
accordingly
having
so
said
went
away
to
his
house
but
aristagoras
took
the
suppliant
branch
and
went
to
the
house
of
cleomenes
and
having
entered
in
as
a
suppliant
he
bade
cleomenes
send
away
the
child
and
listen
to
him
for
the
daughter
of
cleomenes
was
standing
by
him
whose
name
was
gorgo
and
this
as
it
chanced
was
his
only
child
being
of
the
age
now
of
eight
or
nine
years
cleomenes
however
bade
him
say
that
which
he
desired
to
say
and
not
to
stop
on
account
of
the
child
then
aristagoras
proceeded
to
promise
him
money
beginning
with
ten
talents
if
he
would
accomplish
for
him
that
for
which
he
was
asking
and
when
cleomenes
refused
aristagoras
went
on
increasing
the
sums
of
money
offered
until
at
last
he
had
promised
fifty
talents
and
at
that
moment
the
child
cried
out
father
the
stranger
will
do
thee
hurt
if
thou
do
not
leave
him
and
go
cleomenes
then
pleased
by
the
counsel
of
the
child
departed
into
another
room
and
aristagoras
went
away
from
sparta
altogether
and
had
no
opportunity
of
explaining
any
further
about
the
way
up
from
the
sea
to
the
residence
of
the
king
as
regards
this
road
the
truth
is
as
everywhere
there
are
royal
stages
and
excellent
and
the
whole
road
runs
through
country
which
is
inhabited
and
safe
through
lydia
and
phrygia
there
extend
twenty
stages
amounting
to
and
a
half
leagues
and
after
phrygia
succeeds
the
river
halys
at
which
there
is
a
gate
which
one
must
needs
pass
through
in
order
to
cross
the
river
and
a
strong
is
established
there
then
after
crossing
over
into
cappadokia
it
is
stages
being
a
hundred
and
four
leagues
by
this
way
to
the
borders
of
kilikia
and
on
the
borders
of
the
kilikians
you
will
pass
through
two
several
gates
and
go
by
two
several
then
after
passing
through
these
it
is
three
stages
amounting
to
fifteen
and
a
half
leagues
to
journey
through
kilikia
and
the
boundary
of
kilikia
and
armenia
is
a
navigable
river
called
euphrates
in
armenia
the
number
of
stages
with
is
fifteen
and
of
leagues
and
a
half
and
there
is
a
on
the
way
then
from
armenia
when
one
enters
the
land
of
matiene
there
are
stages
amounting
to
a
hundred
and
leagues
and
through
this
land
flow
four
navigable
rivers
which
can
not
be
crossed
but
by
ferries
first
the
tigris
then
a
second
and
third
called
both
by
the
same
name
though
they
are
not
the
same
river
nor
do
they
flow
from
the
same
region
for
the
of
them
flows
from
the
armenian
land
and
the
other
from
that
of
the
matienians
and
the
fourth
of
the
rivers
is
called
gyndes
the
same
which
once
cyrus
divided
into
three
hundred
and
sixty
channels
passing
thence
into
the
kissian
land
there
are
eleven
stages
and
a
half
leagues
to
the
river
choaspes
which
is
also
a
navigable
stream
and
upon
this
is
built
the
city
of
susa
the
number
of
these
stages
amounts
in
all
to
one
hundred
and
eleven
this
is
the
number
of
stages
with
as
one
goes
up
from
sardis
to
susa
and
if
the
royal
road
has
been
rightly
measured
as
regards
leagues
and
if
the
league
is
equal
to
thirty
furlongs
as
undoubtedly
it
is
the
number
of
furlongs
from
sardis
to
that
which
is
called
the
palace
of
memnon
is
thirteen
thousand
five
hundred
the
number
of
leagues
being
four
hundred
and
fifty
so
if
one
travels
a
hundred
and
fifty
furlongs
each
day
just
ninety
days
are
spent
on
the
journey
thus
the
milesian
aristagoras
when
he
told
cleomenes
the
lacedemonian
that
the
journey
up
from
the
sea
to
the
residence
of
the
king
was
one
of
three
months
spoke
correctly
but
if
any
one
demands
a
more
exact
statement
yet
than
this
i
will
give
him
that
also
for
we
ought
to
reckon
in
addition
to
this
the
length
of
the
road
from
ephesos
to
sardis
and
i
say
accordingly
that
the
whole
number
of
furlongs
from
the
sea
of
hellas
to
susa
for
by
that
name
the
city
of
memnon
is
known
is
fourteen
thousand
and
forty
for
the
number
of
furlongs
from
ephesos
to
sardis
is
five
hundred
and
forty
thus
the
three
months
journey
is
lengthened
by
three
days
added
aristagoras
then
being
driven
out
of
sparta
proceeded
to
athens
which
had
been
set
free
from
the
rule
of
despots
in
the
way
which
i
shall
when
hipparchos
the
son
of
peisistratos
and
brother
of
the
despot
hippias
after
seeing
a
vision
of
a
dream
which
signified
it
to
him
plainly
had
been
slain
by
aristogeiton
and
harmodios
who
were
originally
by
descent
gephyraians
the
athenians
continued
for
four
years
after
this
to
be
despotically
governed
no
less
than
formerly
nay
even
more
now
the
vision
of
a
dream
which
hipparchos
had
was
this
in
the
night
before
the
panathenaia
it
seemed
to
hipparchos
that
a
man
came
and
stood
by
him
tall
and
of
fair
form
and
riddling
spoke
to
him
these
verses
with
enduring
soul
as
a
lion
endure
unendurable
evil
no
one
of
men
who
doth
wrong
shall
escape
from
the
judgment
appointed
these
verses
as
soon
as
it
was
day
he
publicly
communicated
to
the
interpreters
of
dreams
but
afterwards
he
put
away
thought
of
the
vision
and
began
to
take
part
in
that
procession
during
which
he
lost
his
life
now
the
gephyraians
of
whom
were
those
who
murdered
hipparchos
according
to
their
own
account
were
originally
descended
from
eretria
but
as
i
find
by
carrying
inquiries
back
they
were
phenicians
of
those
who
came
with
cadmos
to
the
land
which
is
now
called
boeotia
and
they
dwelt
in
the
district
of
tanagra
which
they
had
had
allotted
to
them
in
that
land
then
after
the
cadmeians
had
first
been
driven
out
by
the
argives
these
gephyraians
next
were
driven
out
by
the
boeotians
and
turned
then
towards
athens
and
the
athenians
received
them
on
certain
fixed
conditions
to
be
citizens
of
their
state
laying
down
rules
that
they
should
be
excluded
from
a
number
of
things
not
worth
mentioning
here
now
these
phenicians
who
came
with
cadmos
of
whom
were
the
gephyraians
brought
in
among
the
hellenes
many
arts
when
they
settled
in
this
land
of
boeotia
and
especially
letters
which
did
not
exist
as
it
appears
to
me
among
the
hellenes
before
this
time
and
at
first
they
brought
in
those
which
are
used
by
the
phenician
race
generally
but
afterwards
as
time
went
on
they
changed
with
their
speech
the
form
of
the
letters
also
during
this
time
the
ionians
were
the
race
of
hellenes
who
dwelt
near
them
in
most
of
the
places
where
they
were
and
these
having
received
letters
by
instruction
of
the
phenicians
changed
their
form
slightly
and
so
made
use
of
them
and
in
doing
so
they
declared
them
to
be
called
phenicians
as
was
just
seeing
that
the
phenicians
had
introduced
them
into
hellas
also
the
ionians
from
ancient
time
call
paper
skins
because
formerly
paper
being
scarce
they
used
skins
of
goat
and
sheep
nay
even
in
my
own
time
many
of
the
barbarians
write
on
such
skins
i
myself
too
once
saw
cadmeian
characters
in
the
temple
of
ismenian
apollo
at
thebes
of
the
boeotians
engraved
on
certain
tripods
and
in
most
respects
resembling
the
ionic
letters
one
of
these
tripods
has
the
inscription
me
amphitryon
offered
from
land
teleboian
returning
this
inscription
would
be
of
an
age
contemporary
with
laïos
the
son
of
labdacos
the
son
of
polydoros
the
son
of
cadmos
another
tripod
says
thus
in
hexameter
rhythm
me
did
scaios
offer
to
thee
apollo
victor
in
contest
of
boxing
a
gift
most
fair
in
thine
honour
now
scaios
would
be
the
son
of
hippocoön
at
least
if
it
were
really
he
who
offered
it
and
not
another
with
the
same
name
as
the
son
of
hippocoön
being
of
an
age
contemporary
with
oedipus
the
son
of
laïos
and
the
third
tripod
also
in
hexameter
rhythm
says
me
laodamas
offered
to
thee
apollo
he
of
his
wealth
being
king
as
a
gift
most
fair
in
thine
honor
now
it
was
in
the
reign
of
this
very
laodamas
the
son
of
eteocles
that
the
cadmeians
were
driven
out
by
the
argives
and
turned
to
go
to
the
enchelians
and
the
gephyraians
being
then
left
behind
were
afterwards
forced
by
the
boeotians
to
retire
to
athens
moreover
they
have
temples
established
in
athens
in
which
the
other
athenians
have
no
part
and
besides
others
which
are
different
from
the
rest
there
is
especially
a
temple
of
demeter
achaia
and
a
celebration
of
her
mysteries
i
have
told
now
of
the
vision
of
a
dream
seen
by
hipparchos
and
also
whence
the
gephrynians
were
descended
of
which
race
were
the
murderers
of
hipparchos
and
in
addition
to
this
i
must
resume
and
continue
the
story
which
i
was
about
to
tell
at
first
how
the
athenians
were
freed
from
despots
when
hippias
was
despot
and
was
dealing
harshly
with
the
athenians
because
of
the
death
of
hipparchos
the
alcmaionidai
who
were
of
athenian
race
and
were
fugitives
from
the
sons
of
peisistratos
as
they
did
not
succeed
in
their
attempt
made
together
with
the
other
athenian
exiles
to
return
by
force
but
met
with
great
disaster
when
they
attempted
to
return
and
set
athens
free
after
they
had
fortified
leipsydrion
which
is
above
paionia
these
alomaionidai
after
that
still
devising
every
means
against
the
sons
of
peisistratos
accepted
the
contract
to
build
and
complete
the
temple
at
delphi
that
namely
which
now
exists
but
then
did
not
as
yet
and
being
wealthy
and
men
of
repute
already
from
ancient
time
they
completed
the
temple
in
a
manner
more
beautiful
than
the
plan
required
and
especially
in
this
respect
that
having
agreed
to
make
the
temple
of
common
limestone
they
built
the
front
parts
of
it
in
parian
marble
so
then
as
the
athenians
say
these
men
being
settled
at
delphi
persuaded
the
pythian
prophetess
by
gifts
of
money
that
whenever
men
of
the
spartans
should
come
to
inquire
of
the
oracle
either
privately
or
publicly
sent
she
should
propose
to
them
to
set
athens
free
the
lacedemonians
therefore
since
the
same
utterance
was
delivered
to
them
on
all
occasions
sent
anchimolios
the
son
of
aster
who
was
of
repute
among
their
citizens
with
an
army
to
drive
out
the
sons
of
peisistratos
from
athens
although
these
were
very
closely
connected
with
them
by
for
they
held
that
the
concerns
of
the
god
should
be
preferred
to
those
of
men
and
this
force
they
sent
by
sea
in
ships
he
therefore
having
put
in
to
shore
at
phaleron
disembarked
his
army
but
the
sons
of
peisistratos
being
informed
of
this
beforehand
called
in
to
their
aid
an
auxiliary
force
from
thessaly
for
they
had
made
an
alliance
with
the
thessalians
and
the
thessalians
at
their
request
sent
by
public
resolution
a
body
of
a
thousand
horse
and
also
their
king
kineas
a
man
of
conion
so
having
obtained
these
as
allies
the
sons
of
peisistratos
contrived
as
follows
they
cut
down
the
trees
in
the
plain
of
phaleron
and
made
this
district
fit
for
horsemen
to
ride
over
and
after
that
they
sent
the
cavalry
to
attack
the
enemy
camp
who
falling
upon
it
slew
besides
many
others
of
the
lacedemonians
anchimolios
himself
also
and
the
survivors
of
them
they
shut
up
in
their
ships
such
was
the
issue
of
the
first
expedition
from
lacedemon
and
the
of
anchimolios
is
at
alopecai
in
attica
near
the
temple
of
heracles
which
is
at
kynosarges
after
this
the
lacedemonians
equipped
a
larger
expedition
and
sent
it
forth
against
athens
and
they
appointed
to
be
commander
of
the
army
their
king
cleomenes
the
son
of
anaxandrides
and
sent
it
this
time
not
by
sea
but
by
land
with
these
when
they
had
invaded
the
land
of
attica
first
the
thessalian
horse
engaged
battle
and
in
no
long
time
they
were
routed
and
there
fell
of
them
more
than
forty
men
so
the
survivors
departed
without
more
ado
and
went
straight
back
to
thessaly
then
cleomenes
came
to
the
city
together
with
those
of
the
athenians
who
desired
to
be
free
and
began
to
besiege
the
despots
shut
up
in
the
pelasgian
wall
and
the
lacedemonians
would
never
have
captured
the
sons
of
peisistratos
at
all
for
they
on
their
side
had
no
design
to
make
a
long
blockade
and
the
others
were
well
provided
with
food
and
drink
so
that
they
would
have
gone
away
back
to
sparta
after
besieging
them
for
a
few
days
only
but
as
it
was
a
thing
happened
just
at
this
time
which
was
unfortunate
for
those
and
at
the
same
time
of
assistance
to
these
for
the
children
of
the
sons
of
peisistratos
were
captured
while
being
secretly
removed
out
of
the
country
and
when
this
happened
all
their
matters
were
thereby
cast
into
confusion
and
they
surrendered
receiving
back
their
children
on
the
terms
which
the
athenians
desired
namely
that
they
should
depart
out
of
attica
within
five
days
after
this
they
departed
out
of
the
country
and
went
to
sigeion
on
the
scamander
after
their
family
had
ruled
over
the
athenians
for
years
these
also
were
originally
pylians
and
sons
of
neleus
descended
from
the
same
ancestors
as
the
family
of
codros
and
melanthos
who
had
formerly
become
kings
of
athens
being
settlers
from
abroad
hence
too
hippocrates
had
given
to
his
son
the
name
of
peisistratos
as
a
memorial
calling
him
after
peisistratos
the
son
of
nestor
thus
the
athenians
were
freed
from
despots
and
the
things
worthy
to
be
narrated
which
they
did
or
suffered
after
they
were
liberated
up
to
the
time
when
ionia
revolted
from
dareios
and
aristagoras
the
milesian
came
to
athens
and
asked
them
to
help
him
these
i
will
set
forth
first
before
i
proceed
further
athens
which
even
before
that
time
was
great
then
after
having
been
freed
from
despots
became
gradually
yet
greater
and
in
it
two
men
exercised
power
namely
cleisthenes
a
descendant
of
alcmaion
the
same
who
is
reported
to
have
bribed
the
pythian
prophetess
and
isagoras
the
son
of
tisander
of
a
family
which
was
highly
reputed
but
of
his
original
descent
i
am
not
able
to
declare
his
kinsmen
however
offer
sacrifices
to
the
carian
zeus
these
men
came
to
party
strife
for
power
and
then
cleisthenes
was
being
worsted
in
the
struggle
he
made
common
cause
with
the
people
after
this
he
caused
the
athenians
to
be
in
ten
tribes
who
were
formerly
in
four
and
he
changed
the
names
by
which
they
were
called
after
the
sons
of
ion
namely
geleon
aigicoreus
argades
and
hoples
and
invented
for
them
names
taken
from
other
heroes
all
native
athenians
except
ajax
whom
he
added
as
a
neighbour
and
ally
although
he
was
no
athenian
now
in
these
things
it
seems
to
me
that
this
cleisthenes
was
imitating
his
mother
father
cleisthenes
the
despot
of
sikyon
for
cleisthenes
when
he
went
to
war
with
argos
first
caused
to
cease
in
sikyon
the
contests
of
rhapsodists
which
were
concerned
with
the
poems
of
homer
because
argives
and
argos
are
celebrated
in
them
almost
everywhere
then
secondly
since
there
was
as
still
there
is
in
the
itself
of
the
sikyonians
a
of
adrastos
the
son
of
talaos
cleisthenes
had
a
desire
to
cast
him
forth
out
of
the
land
because
he
was
an
argive
so
having
come
to
delphi
he
consulted
the
oracle
as
to
whether
he
should
cast
out
adrastos
and
the
pythian
prophetess
answered
him
saying
that
adrastos
was
king
of
the
sikyonians
whereas
he
was
a
stoner
of
them
so
since
the
god
did
not
permit
him
to
do
this
he
went
away
home
and
considered
means
by
which
adrastos
should
be
brought
to
depart
of
his
own
accord
and
when
he
thought
that
he
had
discovered
them
he
sent
to
thebes
in
boeotia
and
said
that
he
desired
to
introduce
into
his
city
melanippos
the
son
of
astacos
and
the
thebans
gave
him
leave
so
cleisthenes
introduced
melanippos
into
his
city
and
appointed
for
him
a
sacred
enclosure
within
the
precincts
of
the
city
hall
itself
and
established
him
there
in
the
strongest
position
now
cleisthenes
introduced
melanippos
for
i
must
relate
this
also
because
he
was
the
greatest
enemy
of
adrastos
seeing
that
he
had
killed
both
his
brother
mekisteus
and
his
tydeus
and
when
he
had
appointed
the
sacred
enclosure
for
him
he
took
away
the
sacrifices
and
festivals
of
adrastos
and
gave
them
to
melanippos
now
the
sikyonians
were
accustomed
to
honour
adrastos
with
very
great
honours
for
this
land
was
formerly
the
land
of
polybos
and
adrastos
was
daughter
son
to
polybos
and
polybos
dying
without
sons
gave
his
kingdom
to
adrastos
the
sikyonians
then
not
only
gave
other
honours
to
adrastos
but
also
with
reference
to
his
sufferings
they
specially
honoured
him
with
tragic
choruses
not
paying
the
honour
to
dionysos
but
to
adrastos
cleisthenes
however
gave
back
the
choruses
to
dionysos
and
the
other
rites
besides
this
he
gave
to
melannipos
thus
he
had
done
to
adrastos
and
he
also
changed
the
names
of
the
dorian
tribes
in
order
that
the
sikyonians
might
not
have
the
same
tribes
as
the
argives
in
which
matter
he
showed
great
contempt
of
the
sikyonians
for
the
names
he
gave
were
taken
from
the
names
of
a
pig
and
an
ass
by
changing
only
the
endings
except
in
the
case
of
his
own
tribe
to
which
he
gave
a
name
from
his
own
rule
these
last
then
were
called
archelaoi
while
of
the
rest
those
of
one
tribe
were
called
hyatai
of
another
oneatai
and
of
the
remaining
tribe
choireatai
these
names
of
tribes
were
used
by
the
men
of
sikyon
not
only
in
the
reign
of
cleisthenes
but
also
beyond
that
for
sixty
years
after
his
death
then
however
they
considered
the
matter
and
changed
them
into
hylleis
pamphyloi
and
dymanatai
adding
to
these
a
fourth
to
which
they
gave
the
name
aigialeis
after
aigialeus
the
son
of
adrastos
thus
had
the
cleisthenes
of
sikyon
done
and
the
athenian
cleisthenes
who
was
his
daughter
son
and
was
called
after
him
despising
as
i
suppose
the
ionians
as
he
the
dorians
imitated
his
namesake
cleisthenes
in
order
that
the
athenians
might
not
have
the
same
tribes
as
the
ionians
for
when
at
the
time
of
which
we
speak
he
added
to
his
own
party
the
whole
body
of
the
common
people
of
the
athenians
which
in
former
time
he
had
despised
he
changed
the
names
of
the
tribes
and
made
them
more
in
number
than
they
had
been
he
made
in
fact
ten
rulers
of
tribes
instead
of
four
and
by
tens
also
he
distributed
the
demes
in
the
tribes
and
having
added
the
common
people
to
his
party
he
was
much
superior
to
his
opponents
then
isagoras
as
he
was
being
worsted
in
his
turn
contrived
a
plan
in
opposition
to
him
that
is
to
say
he
called
in
cleomenes
the
lacedemonian
to
help
him
who
had
been
a
to
himself
since
the
siege
of
the
sons
of
peisistratos
moreover
cleomenes
was
accused
of
being
intimate
with
the
wife
of
isagoras
first
then
cleomenes
sent
a
herald
to
athens
demanding
the
expulsion
of
cleisthenes
and
with
him
many
others
of
the
athenians
calling
them
the
men
who
were
under
the
curse
this
message
he
sent
by
instruction
of
isagoras
for
the
alcmaionidai
and
their
party
were
accused
of
the
murder
to
which
reference
was
thus
made
while
he
and
his
friends
had
no
part
in
it
now
the
men
of
the
athenians
who
were
under
the
curse
got
this
name
as
follows
there
was
one
kylon
among
the
athenians
a
man
who
had
gained
the
victory
at
the
olympic
games
this
man
behaved
with
arrogance
wishing
to
make
himself
despot
and
having
formed
for
himself
an
association
of
men
of
his
own
age
he
endeavoured
to
seize
the
acropolis
but
not
being
able
to
get
possession
of
it
he
sat
down
as
a
suppliant
before
the
image
of
the
goddess
these
men
were
taken
from
their
place
as
suppliants
by
the
presidents
of
the
naucraries
who
then
administered
affairs
at
athens
on
the
condition
that
they
should
be
liable
to
any
penalty
short
of
death
and
the
alcmaionidai
are
accused
of
having
put
them
to
death
this
had
occurred
before
the
time
of
peisistratos
now
when
cleomenes
sent
demanding
the
expulsion
of
cleisthenes
and
of
those
under
the
curse
cleisthenes
himself
retired
secretly
but
after
that
nevertheless
cleomenes
appeared
in
athens
with
no
very
large
force
and
having
arrived
he
proceeded
to
expel
as
accursed
seven
hundred
athenian
families
of
which
isagoras
had
suggested
to
him
the
names
having
done
this
he
next
endeavoured
to
dissolve
the
senate
and
he
put
the
offices
of
the
state
into
the
hands
of
three
hundred
who
were
the
partisans
of
isagoras
the
senate
however
making
opposition
and
not
being
willing
to
submit
cleomenes
with
isagoras
and
his
partisans
seized
the
acropolis
then
the
rest
of
the
athenians
joined
together
by
common
consent
and
besieged
them
for
two
days
and
on
the
third
day
so
many
of
them
as
were
lacedemonians
departed
out
of
the
country
under
a
truce
thus
was
accomplished
for
cleomenes
the
ominous
saying
which
was
uttered
to
him
for
when
he
had
ascended
the
acropolis
with
the
design
of
taking
possession
of
it
he
was
going
to
the
sanctuary
of
the
goddess
as
to
address
her
in
prayer
but
the
priestess
stood
up
from
her
seat
before
he
had
passed
through
the
door
and
said
lacedemonian
stranger
go
back
and
enter
not
into
the
temple
for
it
is
not
lawful
for
dorians
to
pass
in
hither
he
said
woman
i
am
not
a
dorian
but
an
achaian
so
then
paying
no
attention
to
the
ominous
speech
he
made
his
attempt
and
then
was
expelled
again
with
the
lacedemonians
but
the
rest
of
the
men
the
athenians
laid
in
bonds
to
be
put
to
death
and
among
them
timesitheos
the
delphian
with
regard
to
whom
i
might
mention
very
great
deeds
of
strength
and
courage
which
he
performed
these
then
having
been
thus
laid
in
bonds
were
put
to
death
and
the
athenians
after
this
sent
for
cleisthenes
to
return
and
also
for
the
seven
hundred
families
which
had
been
driven
out
by
cleomenes
and
then
they
sent
envoys
to
sardis
desiring
to
make
an
alliance
with
the
persians
for
they
were
well
assured
that
the
lacedemonians
and
cleomenes
had
been
utterly
made
their
foes
so
when
these
envoys
had
arrived
at
sardis
and
were
saying
that
which
they
had
been
commanded
to
say
artaphrenes
the
son
of
hystaspes
the
governor
of
sardis
asked
what
men
these
were
who
requested
to
be
allies
of
the
persians
and
where
upon
the
earth
they
dwelt
and
having
heard
this
from
the
envoys
he
summed
up
his
answer
to
them
thus
saying
that
if
the
athenians
were
willing
to
give
earth
and
water
to
dareios
he
was
willing
to
make
alliance
with
them
but
if
not
he
bade
them
begone
and
the
envoys
taking
the
matter
upon
themselves
said
that
they
were
willing
to
do
so
because
they
desired
to
make
the
alliance
these
when
they
returned
to
their
own
land
were
highly
censured
and
cleomenes
meanwhile
conceiving
that
he
had
been
outrageously
dealt
with
by
the
athenians
both
with
words
and
with
deeds
was
gathering
together
an
army
from
the
whole
of
the
peloponnese
not
declaring
the
purpose
for
which
he
was
gathering
it
but
desiring
to
take
vengeance
on
the
people
of
the
athenians
and
intending
to
make
isagoras
despot
for
he
too
had
come
out
of
the
acropolis
together
with
cleomenes
cleomenes
then
with
a
large
army
entered
eleusis
while
at
the
same
time
the
boeotians
by
agreement
with
him
captured
oinoe
and
hysiai
the
demes
which
lay
upon
the
extreme
borders
of
attica
and
the
chalkidians
on
the
other
side
invaded
and
began
to
ravage
various
districts
of
attica
the
athenians
then
though
attacked
on
more
sides
than
one
thought
that
they
would
remember
the
boeotians
and
chalkidians
afterwards
and
arrayed
themselves
against
the
peloponnesians
who
were
in
eleusis
then
as
the
armies
were
just
about
the
join
battle
the
corinthians
first
considering
with
themselves
that
they
were
not
acting
rightly
changed
their
minds
and
departed
and
after
that
demaratos
the
son
of
ariston
did
the
same
who
was
king
of
the
spartans
as
well
as
cleomenes
though
he
had
joined
with
him
in
leading
the
army
out
from
lacedemon
and
had
not
been
before
this
at
variance
with
cleomenes
in
consequence
of
this
dissension
a
law
was
laid
down
at
sparta
that
it
should
not
be
permitted
when
an
army
went
out
that
both
the
kings
should
go
with
it
for
up
to
this
time
both
used
to
go
with
it
and
that
as
one
of
the
kings
was
set
free
from
service
so
one
of
the
sons
of
tyndareus
also
should
be
left
behind
for
before
this
time
both
of
these
two
were
called
upon
by
them
for
help
and
went
with
the
armies
at
this
time
then
in
eleusis
the
rest
of
the
allies
seeing
that
the
kings
of
the
lacedemonians
did
not
agree
and
also
that
the
corinthians
had
deserted
their
place
in
the
ranks
themselves
too
departed
and
got
them
away
quickly
and
this
was
the
fourth
time
that
the
dorians
had
come
to
attica
twice
having
invaded
it
to
make
war
against
it
and
twice
to
help
the
mass
of
the
athenian
people
first
when
they
at
the
same
time
colonised
megara
this
expedition
may
rightly
be
designated
as
taking
place
when
codros
was
king
of
the
athenians
for
the
second
and
third
times
when
they
came
making
expeditions
from
sparta
to
drive
out
the
sons
of
peisistratos
and
fourthly
on
this
occasion
when
cleomenes
at
the
head
of
the
peloponnesians
invaded
eleusis
thus
the
dorians
invaded
athens
then
for
the
fourth
time
this
army
then
having
been
ingloriously
broken
up
the
athenians
after
that
desiring
to
avenge
themselves
made
expedition
first
against
the
chalkidians
and
the
boeotians
came
to
the
euripos
to
help
the
chalkidians
the
athenians
therefore
seeing
those
who
had
come
to
help
resolved
first
to
attack
the
boeotians
before
the
chalkidians
accordingly
they
engaged
battle
with
the
boeotians
and
had
much
the
better
of
them
and
after
having
slain
very
many
they
took
seven
hundred
of
them
captive
on
this
very
same
day
the
athenians
passed
over
into
euboea
and
engaged
battle
with
the
chalkidians
as
well
and
having
conquered
these
also
they
left
four
thousand
holders
of
allotments
in
the
land
belonging
to
the
breeders
of
horses
now
the
wealthier
of
the
chalkidians
were
called
the
breeders
of
horses
and
as
many
of
them
as
they
took
captive
they
kept
in
confinement
together
with
the
boeotians
who
had
been
captured
bound
with
fetters
and
then
after
a
time
they
let
them
go
having
fixed
their
ransom
at
two
pounds
of
silver
apiece
but
their
fetters
in
which
they
had
been
bound
they
hung
up
on
the
acropolis
and
these
were
still
existing
even
to
my
time
hanging
on
walls
which
had
been
scorched
with
fire
by
the
mede
and
just
opposite
the
sanctuary
which
lies
towards
the
west
the
tenth
part
of
the
ransom
also
they
dedicated
for
an
offering
and
made
of
it
a
chariot
of
bronze
which
stands
on
the
left
hand
as
you
enter
the
propylaia
in
the
acropolis
and
on
it
is
the
following
inscription
matched
in
the
deeds
of
war
with
the
tribes
of
boeotia
and
chalkis
the
sons
of
athens
prevailed
conquered
and
tamed
them
in
fight
in
chains
of
iron
and
darkness
they
quenched
their
insolent
spirit
and
to
athene
present
these
of
their
ransom
a
tithe
the
athenians
accordingly
increased
in
power
and
it
is
evident
not
by
one
instance
only
but
in
every
way
that
equality
is
an
excellent
thing
since
the
athenians
while
they
were
ruled
by
despots
were
not
better
in
war
that
any
of
those
who
dwelt
about
them
whereas
after
they
had
got
rid
of
despots
they
became
far
the
first
this
proves
that
when
they
were
kept
down
they
were
wilfully
slack
because
they
were
working
for
a
master
whereas
when
they
had
been
set
free
each
one
was
eager
to
achieve
something
for
himself
these
then
were
faring
thus
and
the
thebans
after
this
sent
to
the
god
desiring
to
be
avenged
on
the
athenians
the
pythian
prophetess
however
said
that
vengeance
was
not
possible
for
them
by
their
own
strength
alone
but
bade
them
report
the
matter
to
the
and
ask
help
of
those
who
were
nearest
to
them
so
when
those
who
were
sent
to
consult
the
oracle
returned
they
made
a
general
assembly
and
reported
the
oracle
and
then
the
thebans
heard
them
say
that
they
were
to
ask
help
of
those
who
were
nearest
to
them
they
said
surely
those
who
dwell
nearest
to
us
are
the
men
of
tanagra
and
coroneia
and
thespiai
and
these
always
fight
zealously
on
our
side
and
endure
the
war
with
us
to
the
end
what
need
is
there
that
we
ask
of
these
rather
perhaps
that
is
not
the
meaning
of
the
oracle
while
they
commented
upon
it
thus
at
length
one
perceived
that
which
the
oracle
means
to
tell
us
asopos
is
said
to
have
had
two
daughters
born
to
him
thebe
and
egina
and
as
these
are
sisters
i
think
that
the
god
gave
us
for
answer
that
we
should
ask
the
men
of
egina
to
become
our
helpers
then
as
there
seemed
to
be
no
opinion
expressed
which
was
better
than
this
they
sent
forthwith
and
asked
the
men
of
egina
to
help
them
calling
upon
them
in
accordance
with
the
oracle
and
they
when
these
made
request
said
that
they
sent
with
them
the
sons
of
aiacos
to
help
them
after
that
the
thebans
having
made
an
attempt
with
the
alliance
of
the
sons
of
aiacos
and
having
been
roughly
handled
by
the
athenians
sent
again
and
gave
them
back
the
sons
of
aiacos
and
asked
them
for
men
so
the
eginetans
exalted
by
great
prosperity
and
calling
to
mind
an
ancient
grudge
against
the
athenians
then
on
the
request
of
the
thebans
commenced
a
war
against
the
athenians
without
notice
for
while
the
athenians
were
intent
on
the
boeotians
they
sailed
against
them
to
attica
with
ships
of
war
and
they
devastated
phaleron
and
also
many
demes
in
the
remainder
of
the
coast
region
and
so
doing
they
deeply
stirred
the
resentment
of
the
athenians
now
the
grudge
which
was
due
beforehand
from
the
eginetans
to
the
athenians
came
about
from
a
beginning
which
was
as
follows
the
land
of
the
epidaurians
yielded
to
its
inhabitants
no
fruit
and
accordingly
with
reference
to
this
calamity
the
epidaurians
went
to
inquire
at
delphi
and
the
pythian
prophetess
bade
them
set
up
images
of
damia
and
auxesia
and
said
that
when
they
had
set
up
these
they
would
meet
with
better
fortune
the
epidaurians
then
asked
further
whether
they
should
make
images
of
bronze
or
of
stone
and
the
prophetess
bade
them
not
use
either
of
these
but
make
them
of
the
wood
of
a
cultivated
the
epidaurians
therefore
asked
the
athenians
to
allow
them
to
cut
for
themselves
an
since
they
thought
that
their
olives
were
the
most
sacred
nay
some
say
that
at
that
time
there
were
no
olives
in
any
part
of
the
earth
except
at
athens
the
athenians
said
that
they
would
allow
them
on
condition
that
they
should
every
year
bring
due
offerings
to
athene
polias
and
to
erechtheus
the
epidaurians
then
having
agreed
to
these
terms
obtained
that
which
they
asked
and
they
made
images
out
of
these
and
set
them
up
and
their
land
bore
fruit
and
they
continued
to
fulfil
towards
the
athenians
that
which
they
had
agreed
to
do
now
during
this
time
and
also
before
this
the
eginetans
were
subject
to
the
epidaurians
and
besides
other
things
they
were
wont
to
pass
over
to
epidauros
to
have
their
disputes
with
one
another
settled
by
law
but
after
this
time
they
built
for
themselves
ships
and
made
revolt
from
the
epidaurians
moved
thereto
by
wilfulness
so
as
they
were
at
variance
with
them
they
continued
to
inflict
damage
on
them
since
in
fact
they
had
command
of
the
sea
and
especially
they
stole
away
from
them
these
images
of
damia
and
auxesia
and
they
brought
them
and
set
them
up
in
the
inland
part
of
their
country
at
a
place
called
oia
which
is
about
twenty
furlongs
distant
from
their
city
having
set
them
up
in
this
spot
they
worshipped
them
with
sacrifices
and
choruses
of
women
accompanied
with
scurrilous
jesting
ten
men
being
appointed
for
each
of
the
deities
to
provide
the
choruses
and
the
choruses
spoke
evil
of
no
man
but
only
of
the
women
of
the
place
now
the
epidaurians
also
had
the
same
rites
and
they
have
also
rites
which
may
not
be
divulged
these
images
then
having
been
stolen
the
epidaurians
no
longer
continued
to
fulfil
towards
the
athenians
that
which
they
had
agreed
the
athenians
accordingly
sent
and
expressed
displeasure
to
the
epidaurians
and
they
declared
saying
that
they
were
doing
no
wrong
for
during
the
time
when
they
had
the
images
in
their
country
they
continued
to
fulfil
that
which
they
had
agreed
upon
but
since
they
had
been
deprived
of
them
it
was
not
just
that
they
should
make
the
offerings
any
more
and
they
bade
them
demand
these
from
the
men
of
egina
who
had
the
images
so
the
athenians
sent
to
egina
and
demanded
the
images
back
but
the
eginetans
said
that
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
athenians
the
athenians
then
report
that
in
one
single
trireme
were
despatched
those
of
their
citizens
who
were
sent
by
the
state
after
this
demand
who
having
come
to
egina
attempted
to
tear
up
from
off
their
pedestals
the
images
alleging
that
they
were
made
of
wood
which
belonged
to
the
athenians
in
order
to
carry
them
back
with
them
but
not
being
able
to
get
hold
of
them
in
this
manner
say
the
athenians
they
threw
ropes
round
them
and
were
pulling
them
when
suddenly
as
they
pulled
thunder
came
on
and
an
earthquake
at
the
same
time
with
the
thunder
and
the
crew
of
the
trireme
who
were
pulling
were
made
beside
themselves
by
these
and
being
brought
to
this
condition
they
killed
one
another
as
if
they
were
enemies
until
at
last
but
one
of
the
whole
number
was
left
and
he
returned
alone
to
phaleron
thus
the
athenians
report
that
it
came
to
pass
but
the
eginetans
say
that
it
was
not
with
a
single
ship
that
the
athenians
came
for
a
single
ship
and
even
a
few
more
than
one
they
could
have
easily
repelled
even
if
they
had
not
happened
to
have
ships
of
their
own
but
they
say
that
the
athenians
sailed
upon
their
country
with
a
large
fleet
of
ships
and
they
gave
way
before
them
and
did
not
fight
a
they
can
not
however
declare
with
certainty
whether
they
gave
way
thus
because
they
admitted
that
they
were
not
strong
enough
to
fight
the
battle
by
sea
or
because
they
intended
to
do
something
of
the
kind
which
they
actually
did
the
athenians
then
they
say
as
no
one
met
them
in
fight
landed
from
their
ships
and
made
for
the
images
but
not
being
able
to
tear
them
up
from
their
pedestals
at
last
they
threw
ropes
round
them
and
began
to
pull
until
the
images
as
they
were
being
pulled
did
both
the
same
thing
and
here
they
report
something
which
i
can
not
believe
but
some
other
man
may
for
they
say
that
the
images
fell
upon
their
knees
to
them
and
that
they
continue
to
be
in
that
position
ever
since
this
time
the
athenians
they
say
were
doing
thus
and
meanwhile
they
themselves
say
the
eginetans
being
informed
that
the
athenians
were
about
to
make
an
expedition
against
them
got
the
argives
to
help
them
and
just
when
the
athenians
had
disembarked
upon
the
eginetan
land
the
argives
had
come
to
their
rescue
and
not
having
been
perceived
when
they
passed
over
from
epidauros
to
the
island
they
fell
upon
the
athenians
before
these
had
heard
anything
of
the
matter
cutting
them
off
secretly
from
the
way
to
their
ships
and
at
this
moment
it
was
that
the
thunder
and
the
earthquake
came
upon
them
this
is
the
report
which
is
given
by
the
argives
and
eginetans
both
and
it
is
admitted
by
the
athenians
also
that
but
one
alone
of
them
survived
and
came
back
to
attica
only
the
argives
say
that
this
one
remained
alive
from
destruction
wrought
by
them
upon
the
army
of
athens
while
the
athenians
say
that
the
divine
power
was
the
destroyer
however
even
this
one
man
did
not
remain
alive
but
perished
they
say
in
the
following
manner
when
he
returned
to
athens
he
reported
the
calamity
which
had
happened
and
the
wives
of
the
men
who
had
gone
on
the
expedition
to
egina
hearing
it
and
being
very
indignant
that
he
alone
of
all
had
survived
came
round
this
man
and
proceeded
to
stab
him
with
the
brooches
of
their
mantles
each
one
of
them
asking
of
him
where
her
husband
was
thus
he
was
slain
and
to
the
athenians
it
seemed
that
the
deed
of
the
women
was
a
much
more
terrible
thing
even
than
the
calamity
which
had
happened
and
not
knowing
it
is
said
how
they
should
punish
the
women
in
any
other
way
they
changed
their
fashion
of
dress
to
that
of
ionia
for
before
this
the
women
of
the
athenians
wore
dorian
dress
very
like
that
of
corinth
they
changed
it
therefore
to
the
linen
tunic
in
order
that
they
might
not
have
use
for
brooches
in
truth
however
this
fashion
of
dress
is
not
ionian
originally
but
carian
for
the
old
hellenic
fashion
of
dress
for
women
was
universally
the
same
as
that
which
we
now
call
dorian
moreover
it
is
said
that
with
reference
to
these
events
the
argives
and
eginetans
made
it
a
custom
among
themselves
in
both
countries
to
have
the
brooches
made
half
as
large
again
as
the
size
which
was
then
established
in
use
and
that
their
women
should
offer
brooches
especially
in
the
temple
of
these
goddesses
and
also
that
they
should
carry
neither
pottery
of
athens
nor
anything
else
of
athenian
make
to
the
temple
but
that
it
should
be
the
custom
for
the
future
to
drink
there
from
pitchers
made
in
the
lands
themselves
the
women
of
the
argives
and
eginetans
from
this
time
onwards
because
of
the
quarrel
with
the
athenians
continued
to
wear
brooches
larger
than
before
and
still
do
so
even
to
my
time
and
the
origin
of
the
enmity
of
the
athenians
towards
the
eginetans
came
in
the
manner
which
has
been
said
so
at
this
time
when
the
thebans
invaded
them
the
eginetans
readily
came
to
the
assistance
of
the
boeotians
calling
to
mind
what
occurred
about
the
images
the
eginetans
then
were
laying
waste
as
i
have
said
the
coast
regions
of
attica
and
when
the
athenians
were
resolved
to
make
an
expedition
against
the
eginetans
an
oracle
came
to
them
from
delphi
bidding
them
stay
for
thirty
years
reckoned
from
the
time
of
the
wrong
done
by
the
eginetans
and
in
the
year
to
appoint
a
sacred
enclosure
for
aiacos
and
then
to
begin
the
war
against
the
eginetans
and
they
would
succeed
as
they
desired
but
if
they
should
make
an
expedition
against
them
at
once
they
would
suffer
in
the
meantime
very
much
evil
and
also
inflict
very
much
but
at
last
they
would
subdue
them
when
the
athenians
heard
the
report
of
this
they
appointed
a
sacred
enclosure
for
aiacos
namely
that
which
is
now
established
close
to
the
but
they
could
not
endure
to
hear
that
they
must
stay
for
thirty
years
when
they
had
suffered
injuries
from
the
eginetans
while
however
they
were
preparing
to
take
vengeance
a
matter
arose
from
the
lacedemonians
which
provided
a
hindrance
to
them
for
the
lacedemonians
having
learnt
that
which
had
been
contrived
by
the
alcmaionidai
with
respect
to
the
pythian
prophetess
and
that
which
had
been
contrived
by
the
pythian
prophetess
against
themselves
and
the
sons
of
peisistratos
were
doubly
grieved
not
only
because
they
had
driven
out
into
exile
men
who
were
their
but
also
because
after
they
had
done
this
no
gratitude
was
shown
to
them
by
the
athenians
moreover
in
addition
to
this
they
were
urged
on
by
the
oracles
which
said
that
many
injuries
would
be
suffered
by
them
from
the
athenians
of
which
oracles
they
had
not
been
aware
of
before
but
they
had
come
to
know
them
since
cleomenes
had
brought
them
to
sparta
in
fact
cleomenes
had
obtained
from
the
acropolis
of
the
athenians
those
oracles
which
the
sons
of
peisistratos
possessed
before
and
had
left
in
the
temple
when
they
were
driven
out
and
cleomenes
recovered
them
after
they
had
been
left
behind
at
this
time
then
when
the
lacedemonians
had
recovered
the
oracles
and
when
they
saw
that
the
athenians
were
increasing
in
power
and
were
not
at
all
willing
to
submit
to
them
observing
that
the
athenian
race
now
that
it
was
free
was
becoming
a
match
for
their
own
whereas
when
held
down
by
despots
it
was
weak
and
ready
to
be
ruled
perceiving
i
say
all
these
things
they
sent
for
hippias
the
son
of
peisistratos
to
come
from
sigeion
on
the
hellespont
whither
the
family
of
peisistratos
go
for
refuge
and
when
hippias
had
come
upon
the
summons
the
spartans
sent
also
for
envoys
to
come
from
their
other
allies
and
spoke
to
them
as
follows
allies
we
are
conscious
within
ourselves
that
we
have
not
acted
rightly
for
incited
by
counterfeit
oracles
we
drove
out
into
exile
men
who
were
very
closely
united
with
us
as
and
who
undertook
the
task
of
rendering
athens
submissive
to
us
and
then
after
having
done
this
we
delivered
over
the
state
to
a
thankless
populace
which
so
soon
as
it
had
raised
its
head
having
been
freed
by
our
means
drove
out
us
and
our
king
with
wanton
outrage
and
now
exalted
with
pride
it
is
increasing
in
power
so
that
the
neighbours
of
these
men
first
of
all
that
is
the
boeotians
and
chalkidians
have
already
learnt
and
perhaps
some
others
also
will
afterwards
learn
that
they
committed
an
error
as
however
we
erred
in
doing
those
things
of
which
we
have
spoken
we
will
try
now
to
take
vengeance
on
them
going
thither
together
with
you
since
it
was
for
this
very
purpose
that
we
sent
for
hippias
whom
ye
see
here
and
for
you
also
to
come
from
your
cities
in
order
that
with
common
counsel
and
a
common
force
we
might
conduct
him
to
athens
and
render
back
to
him
that
which
we
formerly
took
away
thus
they
spoke
but
the
majority
of
the
allies
did
not
approve
of
their
words
the
rest
however
kept
silence
but
the
corinthian
socles
spoke
as
follows
a
surely
now
the
heaven
shall
be
below
the
earth
and
the
earth
raised
up
on
high
above
the
heaven
and
men
shall
have
their
dwelling
in
the
sea
and
fishes
shall
have
that
habitation
which
men
had
before
seeing
that
ye
lacedemonians
are
doing
away
with
free
governments
and
are
preparing
to
bring
back
despotism
again
into
our
cities
than
which
there
is
no
more
unjust
or
more
murderous
thing
among
men
for
if
in
truth
this
seems
to
you
to
be
good
namely
that
the
cities
should
be
ruled
by
despots
do
ye
yourselves
first
set
up
a
despot
in
your
own
state
and
then
endeavour
to
establish
them
also
for
others
but
as
it
is
ye
are
acting
unfairly
towards
your
allies
seeing
that
ye
have
had
no
experience
of
despots
yourselves
and
provide
with
the
greatest
care
at
sparta
that
this
may
never
come
to
pass
if
however
ye
had
had
experience
of
it
as
we
have
had
ye
would
be
able
to
contribute
juster
opinions
of
it
than
at
present
b
for
the
established
order
of
the
corinthian
state
was
this
the
government
was
an
oligarchy
and
the
oligarchs
who
were
called
bacchiadai
had
control
over
the
state
and
made
marriages
among
themselves
now
one
of
these
men
named
amphion
had
a
daughter
born
to
him
who
was
lame
and
her
name
was
labda
this
daughter
since
none
of
the
bacchiadai
wished
to
marry
her
was
taken
to
wife
by
aëtion
the
son
of
echecrates
who
was
of
the
deme
of
petra
but
by
original
descent
a
lapith
and
of
the
race
of
caineus
neither
from
this
wife
nor
from
another
were
children
born
to
him
therefore
he
set
out
to
delphi
to
inquire
about
offspring
and
as
he
entered
forthwith
the
prophetess
addressed
him
in
these
lines
to
be
honoured
art
thou
yet
none
doth
render
thee
honour
labda
conceives
and
a
rolling
rock
will
she
bear
which
shall
ruin
down
on
the
heads
of
the
kings
and
with
chastisement
visit
corinthos
this
answer
given
to
aëtion
was
by
some
means
reported
to
the
bacchiadai
to
whom
the
oracle
which
had
come
to
corinth
before
this
was
not
intelligible
an
oracle
which
had
reference
to
the
same
thing
as
that
of
aëtion
and
said
thus
eagle
conceives
in
the
rocks
and
shall
bear
a
ravening
lion
strong
and
fierce
to
devour
who
the
knees
of
many
shall
loosen
ponder
this
well
in
your
minds
i
bid
you
corinthians
whose
dwelling
lies
about
fair
peirene
spring
and
in
craggy
corinthos
c
this
oracle
i
say
having
come
before
to
the
bacchiadai
was
obscure
but
afterwards
when
they
heard
that
which
had
come
to
aëtion
forthwith
they
understood
the
former
also
that
it
was
in
accord
with
that
of
aëtion
and
understanding
this
one
also
they
kept
quiet
desiring
to
destroy
the
offspring
which
should
be
born
to
aëtion
then
so
soon
as
his
wife
bore
a
child
they
sent
ten
of
their
own
number
to
the
deme
in
which
aëtion
had
his
dwelling
to
slay
the
child
and
when
these
had
come
to
petra
and
had
passed
into
the
court
of
aëtion
house
they
asked
for
the
child
and
labda
not
knowing
anything
of
the
purpose
for
which
they
had
come
and
supposing
them
to
be
asking
for
the
child
on
account
of
friendly
feeling
towards
its
father
brought
it
and
placed
it
in
the
hands
of
one
of
them
now
they
it
seems
had
resolved
by
the
way
that
the
first
of
them
who
received
the
child
should
dash
it
upon
the
ground
however
when
labda
brought
and
gave
it
it
happened
by
divine
providence
that
the
child
smiled
at
the
man
who
had
received
it
and
when
he
perceived
this
a
feeling
of
compassion
prevented
him
from
killing
it
and
having
this
compassion
he
delivered
it
to
the
next
man
and
he
to
the
third
thus
it
passed
through
the
hands
of
all
the
ten
delivered
from
one
to
another
since
none
of
them
could
bring
himself
to
destroy
its
life
so
they
gave
the
child
back
to
its
mother
and
went
out
and
then
standing
by
the
doors
they
abused
and
found
fault
with
one
another
laying
blame
especially
on
the
one
who
had
first
received
the
child
because
he
had
not
done
according
to
that
which
had
been
resolved
until
at
last
after
some
time
they
determined
again
to
enter
and
all
to
take
a
share
in
the
murder
d
from
the
offspring
of
aëtion
however
it
was
destined
that
evils
should
spring
up
for
corinth
for
labda
was
listening
to
all
this
as
she
stood
close
by
the
door
and
fearing
lest
they
should
change
their
mind
and
take
the
child
a
second
time
and
kill
it
she
carried
it
and
concealed
it
in
the
place
which
seemed
to
her
the
least
likely
to
be
discovered
that
is
to
say
a
feeling
sure
that
if
they
should
return
and
come
to
a
search
they
were
likely
to
examine
everything
and
this
in
fact
happened
so
when
they
had
come
and
searching
had
failed
to
find
it
they
thought
it
best
to
return
and
say
to
those
who
had
sent
them
that
they
had
done
all
that
which
they
had
been
charged
by
them
to
do
e
they
then
having
departed
said
this
and
after
this
the
son
of
aëtion
grew
and
because
he
had
escaped
this
danger
the
name
of
kypselos
was
given
him
as
a
surname
derived
from
the
then
when
kypselos
had
grown
to
manhood
and
was
seeking
divination
a
answer
was
given
him
at
delphi
placing
trust
in
which
he
made
an
attempt
upon
corinth
and
obtained
possession
of
it
now
the
answer
was
as
follows
is
this
man
lot
of
a
truth
who
enters
my
dwelling
offspring
of
aëtion
he
shall
rule
in
famous
corinthos
kypselos
he
and
his
sons
but
his
children
children
no
longer
such
was
the
oracle
and
kypselos
when
he
became
despot
was
a
man
of
this
character
many
of
the
corinthians
he
drove
into
exile
many
he
deprived
of
their
wealth
and
very
many
more
of
their
lives
f
and
when
he
had
reigned
for
thirty
years
and
had
brought
his
life
to
a
prosperous
end
his
son
periander
became
his
successor
in
the
despotism
now
periander
at
first
was
milder
than
his
father
but
after
he
had
had
dealings
through
messengers
with
thrasybulos
the
despot
of
miletos
he
became
far
more
murderous
even
than
kypselos
for
he
sent
a
messenger
to
thrasybulos
and
asked
what
settlement
of
affairs
was
the
safest
for
him
to
make
in
order
that
he
might
best
govern
his
state
and
thrasybulos
led
forth
the
messenger
who
had
come
from
periander
out
of
the
city
and
entered
into
a
field
of
growing
corn
and
as
he
passed
through
the
crop
of
corn
while
inquiring
and
asking
questions
repeatedly
of
the
messenger
about
the
occasion
of
his
coming
from
corinth
he
kept
cutting
off
the
heads
of
those
ears
of
corn
which
he
saw
higher
than
the
rest
and
as
he
cut
off
their
heads
he
cast
them
away
until
he
had
destroyed
in
this
manner
the
finest
and
richest
part
of
the
crop
so
having
passed
through
the
place
and
having
suggested
no
word
of
counsel
he
dismissed
the
messenger
when
the
messenger
returned
to
corinth
periander
was
anxious
to
hear
the
counsel
which
had
been
given
but
he
said
that
thrasybulos
had
given
him
no
counsel
and
added
that
he
wondered
at
the
deed
of
periander
in
sending
him
to
such
a
man
for
the
man
was
out
of
his
senses
and
a
waster
of
his
own
goods
relating
at
the
same
time
that
which
he
had
seen
thrasybulos
do
g
so
periander
understanding
that
which
had
been
done
and
perceiving
that
thrasybulos
counselled
him
to
put
to
death
those
who
were
eminent
among
his
subjects
began
then
to
display
all
manner
of
evil
treatment
to
the
citizens
of
the
state
for
whatsoever
kypselos
had
left
undone
in
killing
and
driving
into
exile
this
periander
completed
and
in
one
day
he
stripped
all
the
wives
of
the
corinthians
of
their
clothing
on
account
of
his
own
wife
melissa
for
when
he
had
sent
messengers
to
the
thesprotians
on
the
river
acheron
to
ask
the
oracle
of
the
dead
about
a
deposit
made
with
him
by
a
melissa
appeared
and
said
she
would
not
tell
in
what
place
the
deposit
was
laid
for
she
was
cold
and
had
no
clothes
since
those
which
he
had
buried
with
her
were
of
no
use
to
her
not
having
been
burnt
and
this
she
said
would
be
an
evidence
to
him
that
she
was
speaking
the
truth
namely
that
when
the
oven
was
cold
periander
had
put
his
loaves
into
it
when
the
report
of
this
was
brought
back
to
periander
the
token
made
him
believe
because
he
had
had
commerce
with
melissa
after
she
was
dead
and
straightway
after
receiving
the
message
he
caused
proclamation
to
be
made
that
all
the
wives
of
the
corinthians
should
come
out
to
the
temple
of
hera
they
accordingly
went
as
to
a
festival
in
their
fairest
adornment
and
he
having
set
the
spearmen
of
his
guard
in
ambush
stripped
them
all
alike
both
the
free
women
and
their
attendant
and
having
gathered
together
all
their
clothes
in
a
place
dug
out
he
set
fire
to
them
praying
at
the
same
time
to
melissa
then
after
he
had
done
this
and
had
sent
a
second
time
the
apparition
of
melissa
told
him
in
what
spot
he
had
laid
the
deposit
entrusted
to
him
by
his
such
a
thing
ye
must
know
lacedemonians
is
despotism
and
such
are
its
deeds
and
we
corinthians
marvelled
much
at
first
when
we
saw
that
ye
were
sending
for
hippias
and
now
we
marvel
even
more
because
ye
say
these
things
and
we
adjure
you
calling
upon
the
gods
of
hellas
not
to
establish
despotisms
in
the
cities
if
however
ye
will
not
cease
from
your
design
but
endeavour
to
restore
hippias
contrary
to
that
which
is
just
know
that
the
corinthians
at
least
do
not
give
their
consent
to
that
which
ye
do
socles
being
the
envoy
of
corinth
thus
spoke
and
hippias
made
answer
to
him
calling
to
witness
the
same
gods
as
he
that
assuredly
the
corinthians
would
more
than
all
others
regret
the
loss
of
the
sons
of
peisistratos
when
the
appointed
days
should
have
come
for
them
to
be
troubled
by
the
athenians
thus
hippias
made
answer
being
acquainted
with
the
oracles
more
exactly
than
any
other
man
but
the
rest
of
the
allies
who
for
a
time
had
restrained
themselves
and
kept
silence
when
they
heard
socles
speak
freely
gave
utterance
every
one
of
them
to
that
which
they
felt
and
adopted
the
opinion
of
the
corinthian
envoy
adjuring
the
lacedemonians
not
to
do
any
violence
to
a
city
of
hellas
thus
was
this
brought
to
an
end
and
hippias
being
dismissed
from
thence
had
anthemus
offered
to
him
by
amyntas
king
of
the
macedonians
and
iolcos
by
the
thessalians
he
however
accepted
neither
of
these
but
retired
again
to
sigeion
which
city
peisistratos
had
taken
by
force
of
arms
from
the
mytilenians
and
having
got
possession
of
it
had
appointed
his
own
natural
son
hegesistratos
born
of
an
argive
woman
to
be
despot
of
it
he
however
did
not
without
a
struggle
keep
possession
of
that
which
he
received
from
peisistratos
for
the
mytilenians
and
athenians
carried
on
war
for
a
long
time
having
their
strongholds
respectively
at
achilleion
and
at
sigeion
the
one
side
demanding
that
the
place
be
restored
to
them
and
the
athenians
on
the
other
hand
not
admitting
this
demand
but
proving
by
argument
that
the
aiolians
had
no
better
claim
to
the
territory
of
ilion
than
they
and
the
rest
of
the
hellenes
as
many
as
joined
with
menelaos
in
exacting
vengeance
for
the
rape
of
helen
now
while
these
carried
on
the
war
besides
many
other
things
of
various
kinds
which
occurred
in
the
battles
once
when
a
fight
took
place
and
the
athenians
were
conquering
alcaios
the
poet
taking
to
flight
escaped
indeed
himself
but
the
athenians
retained
possession
of
his
arms
and
hung
them
up
on
the
walls
of
the
temple
of
athene
which
is
at
sigeion
about
this
matter
alcaios
composed
a
song
and
sent
it
to
mytilene
reporting
therein
his
misadventure
to
one
melanippos
who
was
his
friend
finally
periander
the
son
of
kypselos
made
peace
between
the
athenians
and
the
mytilenians
for
to
him
they
referred
the
matter
as
arbitrator
and
he
made
peace
between
them
on
the
condition
that
each
should
continue
to
occupy
that
territory
which
they
then
possessed
sigeion
then
in
this
matter
had
come
under
the
rule
of
the
athenians
and
when
hippias
had
returned
to
asia
from
lacedemon
he
set
everything
in
motion
stirring
up
enmity
between
the
athenians
and
artaphrenes
and
using
every
means
to
secure
that
athens
should
come
under
the
rule
of
himself
and
of
dareios
hippias
i
say
was
thus
engaged
and
the
athenians
meanwhile
hearing
of
these
things
sent
envoys
to
sardis
and
endeavoured
to
prevent
the
persians
from
following
the
suggestions
of
the
exiled
athenians
artaphrenes
however
commanded
them
if
they
desired
to
be
preserved
from
ruin
to
receive
hippias
back
again
this
proposal
the
athenians
were
not
by
any
means
disposed
to
accept
when
it
was
reported
and
as
they
did
not
accept
this
it
became
at
once
a
commonly
received
opinion
among
them
that
they
were
enemies
of
the
persians
while
they
had
these
thoughts
and
had
been
set
at
enmity
with
the
persians
at
this
very
time
aristagoras
the
milesian
ordered
away
from
sparta
by
cleomenes
the
lacedemonian
arrived
at
athens
for
this
was
the
city
which
had
most
power
of
all
the
rest
besides
sparta
and
aristagoras
came
forward
before
the
assembly
of
the
people
and
said
the
same
things
as
he
had
said
at
sparta
about
the
wealth
which
there
was
in
asia
and
about
the
persian
manner
of
making
war
how
they
used
neither
shield
nor
spear
and
were
easy
to
overcome
thus
i
say
he
said
and
also
he
added
this
namely
that
the
milesians
were
colonists
from
the
athenians
and
that
it
was
reasonable
that
the
athenians
should
rescue
them
since
they
had
such
great
power
and
there
was
nothing
which
he
did
not
promise
being
very
urgent
in
his
request
until
at
last
he
persuaded
them
for
it
would
seem
that
it
is
easier
to
deceive
many
than
one
seeing
that
though
he
did
not
prove
able
to
deceive
cleomenes
the
lacedemonian
by
himself
yet
he
did
this
to
thirty
thousand
athenians
the
athenians
then
i
say
being
persuaded
voted
a
resolution
to
despatch
twenty
ships
to
help
the
ionians
and
appointed
to
command
them
melanthios
one
of
their
citizens
who
was
in
all
things
highly
reputed
these
ships
proved
to
be
the
beginning
of
evils
for
the
hellenes
and
the
barbarians
aristagoras
however
sailed
on
before
and
came
to
miletos
and
then
having
devised
a
plan
from
which
no
advantage
was
likely
to
come
for
the
ionians
nor
indeed
was
he
doing
what
he
did
with
a
view
to
that
but
in
order
to
vex
king
dareios
he
sent
a
man
to
phrygia
to
the
piaonians
who
had
been
taken
captive
by
megabazos
from
the
river
strymon
and
who
were
dwelling
in
a
district
and
village
of
phrygia
apart
by
themselves
and
when
the
messenger
came
to
the
paionians
he
spoke
these
words
paionians
aristagoras
the
despot
of
miletos
sent
me
to
offer
to
you
salvation
if
ye
shall
be
willing
to
do
as
he
says
for
now
all
ionia
has
revolted
from
the
king
and
ye
have
an
opportunity
of
coming
safe
to
your
own
land
to
reach
the
sea
shall
be
your
concern
and
after
this
it
shall
be
thenceforth
ours
the
paionians
hearing
this
received
it
as
a
most
welcome
proposal
and
taking
with
them
their
children
and
their
women
they
began
a
flight
to
the
sea
some
of
them
however
were
struck
with
fear
and
remained
in
the
place
where
they
were
having
come
to
the
coast
the
paionians
crossed
over
thence
to
chios
and
when
they
were
already
in
chios
there
arrived
in
their
track
a
large
body
of
persian
horsemen
pursuing
the
paionians
these
as
they
did
not
overtake
them
sent
over
to
chios
to
bid
the
paionians
return
back
the
paionians
however
did
not
accept
their
proposal
but
the
men
of
chios
conveyed
them
from
chios
to
lesbos
and
the
lesbians
brought
them
to
doriscos
and
thence
they
proceeded
by
land
and
came
to
paionia
aristagoras
meanwhile
when
the
athenians
had
arrived
with
twenty
ships
bringing
with
them
also
five
triremes
of
the
eretrians
joined
the
expedition
not
for
the
sake
of
the
athenians
but
of
the
milesians
themselves
to
repay
them
a
debt
which
they
owed
for
the
milesians
in
former
times
had
borne
with
the
eretrians
the
burden
of
all
that
war
which
they
had
with
the
chalkidians
at
the
time
when
the
chalkidians
on
their
side
were
helped
by
the
samians
against
the
eretrians
and
milesians
when
these
i
say
had
arrived
and
the
other
allies
were
on
the
spot
aristagoras
proceeded
to
make
a
march
upon
sardis
on
this
march
he
did
not
go
himself
but
remained
at
miletos
and
appointed
others
to
be
in
command
of
the
milesians
namely
his
brother
charopinos
and
of
the
other
citizens
one
hermophantos
with
this
force
then
the
ionians
came
to
ephesos
and
leaving
their
ships
at
coresos
in
the
land
of
ephesos
went
up
themselves
in
a
large
body
taking
ephesians
to
guide
them
in
their
march
so
they
marched
along
by
the
river
caÿster
and
then
when
they
arrived
after
crossing
the
range
of
tmolos
they
took
sardis
without
any
resistance
all
except
the
citadel
but
the
citadel
artaphrenes
himself
saved
from
capture
having
with
him
a
considerable
force
of
men
from
plundering
this
city
after
they
had
taken
it
they
were
prevented
by
this
the
houses
in
sardis
were
mostly
built
of
reeds
and
even
those
of
them
which
were
of
brick
had
their
roofs
thatched
with
reeds
of
these
houses
one
was
set
on
fire
by
a
soldier
and
forthwith
the
fire
going
on
from
house
to
house
began
to
spread
over
the
whole
town
so
then
as
the
town
was
on
fire
the
lydians
and
all
the
persians
who
were
in
the
city
being
cut
off
from
escape
since
the
fire
was
prevailing
in
the
extremities
round
about
them
and
not
having
any
way
out
of
the
town
flowed
together
to
the
and
to
the
river
pactolos
which
brings
down
for
them
from
tmolos
flowing
through
the
middle
of
their
and
then
runs
out
into
the
river
hermos
and
this
into
the
sea
to
this
pactolos
i
say
and
to
the
the
lydians
and
persians
gathered
themselves
together
and
were
compelled
to
defend
themselves
the
ionians
then
seeing
some
of
the
enemy
standing
on
their
defence
and
others
in
great
numbers
coming
on
to
the
attack
were
struck
with
fear
and
retired
to
the
mountain
called
tmolos
and
after
that
at
nightfall
departed
to
go
to
their
ships
sardis
was
then
destroyed
by
fire
and
in
it
also
the
temple
of
the
native
goddess
hybebe
which
the
persians
alleged
afterwards
as
a
reason
for
setting
on
fire
in
return
the
temples
in
the
land
of
the
hellenes
however
at
the
time
of
which
i
speak
the
persians
who
occupied
districts
within
the
river
halys
informed
beforehand
of
this
movement
were
gathering
together
and
coming
to
the
help
of
the
lydians
and
as
it
chanced
they
found
when
they
came
that
the
ionians
no
longer
were
in
sardis
but
they
followed
closely
in
their
track
and
came
up
with
them
at
ephesos
and
the
ionians
stood
indeed
against
them
in
array
but
when
they
joined
battle
they
had
very
much
the
worse
and
besides
other
persons
of
note
whom
the
persians
slaughtered
there
fell
also
eualkides
commander
of
the
eretrians
a
man
who
had
won
wreaths
in
contests
of
the
games
and
who
was
much
celebrated
by
simonides
of
keos
and
those
of
them
who
survived
the
battle
dispersed
to
their
various
cities
thus
then
they
fought
at
that
time
and
after
the
battle
the
athenians
left
the
ionians
together
and
when
aristagoras
was
urgent
in
calling
upon
them
by
messengers
for
assistance
they
said
that
they
would
not
help
them
the
ionians
however
though
deprived
of
the
alliance
of
the
athenians
none
the
less
continued
to
prepare
for
the
war
with
the
king
so
great
had
been
the
offences
already
committed
by
them
against
dareios
they
sailed
moreover
to
the
hellespont
and
brought
under
their
power
byzantion
and
all
the
other
cities
which
are
in
those
parts
and
then
having
sailed
forth
out
of
the
hellespont
they
gained
in
addition
the
most
part
of
caria
to
be
in
alliance
with
them
for
even
caunos
which
before
was
not
willing
to
be
their
ally
then
after
they
had
burnt
sardis
was
added
to
them
also
the
cyprians
too
excepting
those
of
amathus
were
added
voluntarily
to
their
alliance
for
these
also
had
revolted
from
the
medes
in
the
following
manner
there
was
one
onesilos
younger
brother
of
gorgos
king
of
salamis
and
son
of
chersis
the
son
of
siromos
the
son
of
euelthon
this
man
in
former
times
too
had
been
wont
often
to
advise
gorgos
to
make
revolt
from
the
king
and
at
this
time
when
he
heard
that
the
ionians
had
revolted
he
pressed
him
very
hard
and
endeavoured
to
urge
him
to
it
since
however
he
could
not
persuade
gorgos
onesilos
watched
for
a
time
when
he
had
gone
forth
out
of
the
city
of
salamis
and
then
together
with
the
men
of
his
own
faction
he
shut
him
out
of
the
gates
gorgos
accordingly
being
robbed
of
the
city
went
for
refuge
to
the
medes
and
onesilos
was
ruler
of
salamis
and
endeavoured
to
persuade
all
the
men
of
cyprus
to
join
him
in
revolt
the
others
then
he
persuaded
but
since
those
of
amathus
were
not
willing
to
do
as
he
desired
he
sat
down
before
their
city
and
besieged
it
onesilos
then
was
besieging
amathus
and
meanwhile
when
it
was
reported
to
king
dareios
that
sardis
had
been
captured
and
burnt
by
the
athenians
and
the
ionians
together
and
that
the
leader
of
the
league
for
being
about
these
things
was
the
milesian
aristagoras
it
is
said
that
at
first
being
informed
of
this
he
made
no
account
of
the
ionians
because
he
knew
that
they
at
all
events
would
not
escape
unpunished
for
their
revolt
but
he
inquired
into
who
the
athenians
were
and
when
he
had
been
informed
he
asked
for
his
bow
and
having
received
it
and
placed
an
arrow
upon
the
string
he
discharged
it
upwards
towards
heaven
and
as
he
shot
into
the
air
he
said
zeus
that
it
may
be
granted
me
to
take
vengeance
upon
the
athenians
having
so
said
he
charged
one
of
his
attendants
that
when
dinner
was
set
before
the
king
he
should
say
always
three
times
master
remember
the
athenians
when
he
had
given
this
charge
he
called
into
his
presence
histiaios
the
milesian
whom
dareios
had
now
been
keeping
with
him
for
a
long
time
and
said
i
am
informed
histiaios
that
thy
deputy
to
whom
thou
didst
depute
the
government
of
miletos
has
made
rebellion
against
me
for
he
brought
in
men
against
me
from
the
other
continent
and
persuaded
the
ionians
also
who
shall
pay
the
penalty
to
me
for
that
which
they
did
these
i
say
he
persuaded
to
go
together
with
them
and
thus
he
robbed
me
of
sardis
now
therefore
how
thinkest
thou
that
this
is
well
and
how
without
thy
counsels
was
anything
of
this
kind
done
take
heed
lest
thou
afterwards
find
reason
to
blame
thyself
for
this
histiaios
replied
o
king
what
manner
of
speech
is
this
that
thou
hast
uttered
saying
that
i
counselled
a
matter
from
which
it
was
likely
that
any
vexation
would
grow
for
thee
either
great
or
small
what
have
i
to
seek
for
in
addition
to
that
which
i
have
that
i
should
do
these
things
and
of
what
am
i
in
want
for
i
have
everything
that
thou
hast
and
i
am
thought
worthy
by
thee
to
hear
all
thy
counsels
nay
but
if
my
deputy
is
indeed
acting
in
any
such
manner
as
thou
hast
said
be
assured
that
he
has
done
it
merely
on
his
own
account
i
however
for
my
part
do
not
even
admit
the
report
to
be
true
that
the
milesians
and
my
deputy
are
acting
in
any
rebellious
fashion
against
thy
power
but
if
it
prove
that
they
are
indeed
doing
anything
of
that
kind
and
if
that
which
thou
hast
heard
o
king
be
the
truth
learn
then
what
a
thing
thou
didst
in
removing
me
away
from
the
for
it
seems
that
the
ionians
when
i
had
gone
out
of
the
sight
of
their
eyes
did
that
which
they
had
long
had
a
desire
to
do
whereas
if
i
had
been
in
ionia
not
a
city
would
have
made
the
least
movement
now
therefore
as
quickly
as
possible
let
me
set
forth
to
go
to
ionia
that
i
may
order
all
these
matters
for
thee
as
they
were
before
and
deliver
into
thy
hands
this
deputy
of
miletos
who
contrived
these
things
and
when
i
have
done
this
after
thy
mind
i
swear
by
the
gods
of
the
royal
house
that
i
will
not
put
off
from
me
the
tunic
which
i
wear
when
i
go
down
to
ionia
until
i
have
made
sardinia
tributary
to
thee
which
is
the
largest
of
all
islands
thus
saying
histiaios
endeavoured
to
deceive
the
king
and
dareios
was
persuaded
and
let
him
go
charging
him
when
he
should
have
accomplished
that
which
he
had
promised
to
return
to
him
again
at
susa
in
the
meantime
while
the
news
about
sardis
was
going
up
to
the
king
and
while
dareios
after
doing
that
which
he
did
with
the
bow
came
to
speech
with
histiaios
and
histiaios
having
been
let
go
by
dareios
was
making
his
journey
to
the
during
all
that
time
the
events
were
happening
which
here
as
onesilos
of
salamis
was
besieging
those
of
amathus
it
was
reported
to
him
that
artybios
a
persian
bringing
with
him
in
ships
a
large
persian
army
was
to
be
expected
shortly
to
arrive
in
cyprus
being
informed
of
this
onesilos
sent
heralds
to
different
places
in
ionia
to
summon
the
ionians
to
his
assistance
and
they
took
counsel
together
and
came
without
delay
with
a
large
force
now
the
ionians
arrived
in
cyprus
just
at
the
time
when
the
persians
having
crossed
over
in
ships
from
kilikia
were
proceeding
by
land
to
attack
salamis
while
the
phenicians
with
the
ships
were
sailing
round
the
headland
which
is
called
the
keys
of
cyprus
this
being
the
case
the
despots
of
cyprus
called
together
the
commanders
of
the
ionians
and
said
ionians
we
of
cyprus
give
you
a
choice
which
enemy
ye
will
rather
fight
with
the
persians
or
the
phenicians
for
if
ye
will
rather
array
yourselves
on
land
and
make
trial
of
the
persians
in
fight
it
is
time
now
for
you
to
disembark
from
your
ships
and
array
yourselves
on
the
land
and
for
us
to
embark
in
your
ships
to
contend
against
the
phenicians
but
if
on
the
other
hand
ye
will
rather
make
trial
of
the
phenicians
whichever
of
these
two
ye
shall
choose
ye
must
endeavour
that
so
far
as
it
rests
with
you
both
ionia
and
cyprus
shall
be
free
to
this
the
ionians
replied
we
were
sent
out
by
the
common
authority
of
the
ionians
to
guard
the
sea
and
not
to
deliver
our
ships
to
the
cyprians
and
ourselves
fight
with
the
persians
on
land
we
therefore
will
endeavour
to
do
good
service
in
that
place
to
which
we
were
appointed
and
ye
must
call
to
mind
all
the
evils
which
ye
suffered
from
the
medes
when
ye
were
in
slavery
to
them
and
prove
yourselves
good
men
the
ionians
made
answer
in
these
words
and
afterwards
when
the
persians
had
come
to
the
plain
of
salamis
the
kings
of
the
cyprians
set
in
order
their
array
choosing
the
best
part
of
the
troops
of
salamis
and
of
soloi
to
be
arrayed
against
the
persians
and
setting
the
other
cyprians
against
the
rest
of
the
enemy
troops
and
against
artybios
the
commander
of
the
persians
onesilos
took
up
his
place
in
the
array
by
his
own
free
choice
now
artybios
was
riding
a
horse
which
had
been
trained
to
rear
up
against
a
hoplite
onesilos
accordingly
being
informed
of
this
and
having
a
by
race
of
caria
who
was
of
very
good
repute
as
a
soldier
and
full
of
courage
besides
said
to
this
man
i
am
informed
that
the
horse
of
artybios
rears
upright
and
works
both
with
his
feet
and
his
mouth
against
any
whom
he
is
brought
to
attack
do
thou
therefore
consider
the
matter
and
tell
me
forthwith
which
of
the
two
thou
wilt
rather
watch
for
and
strike
the
horse
or
artybios
himself
to
this
his
attendant
replied
o
king
i
am
ready
to
do
both
or
either
of
these
two
things
and
in
every
case
to
do
that
which
thou
shalt
appoint
for
me
but
i
will
declare
to
thee
the
way
in
which
i
think
it
will
be
most
suitable
for
thy
condition
i
say
that
it
is
right
for
one
who
is
king
and
commander
to
fight
with
a
king
and
commander
for
if
thou
shalt
slay
the
commander
of
the
enemy
it
turns
to
great
glory
for
thee
and
again
if
he
shall
slay
thee
which
heaven
forbid
even
death
when
it
is
at
the
hands
of
a
worthy
foe
is
but
half
to
be
lamented
but
for
us
who
are
under
thy
command
it
is
suitable
to
fight
with
the
others
who
are
under
his
command
and
with
his
horse
and
of
the
tricks
of
the
horse
have
thou
no
fear
at
all
for
i
engage
to
thee
that
after
this
at
least
he
shall
never
stand
against
any
man
more
thus
he
spoke
and
shortly
afterwards
the
opposed
forces
joined
battle
both
on
land
and
with
their
ships
on
that
day
the
ionians
for
their
part
greatly
distinguished
themselves
and
overcame
the
phenicians
and
of
them
the
samians
were
best
and
meanwhile
on
land
when
the
armies
met
they
came
to
close
quarters
and
fought
and
as
regards
the
two
commanders
what
happened
was
this
when
artybios
came
to
fight
with
onesilos
sitting
upon
his
horse
onesilos
as
he
had
concerted
with
his
struck
at
artybios
himself
when
he
came
to
fight
with
him
and
when
the
horse
put
its
hoofs
against
the
shield
of
onesilos
then
the
carian
struck
with
a
falchion
and
smote
off
the
horse
feet
so
artybios
the
commander
of
the
persians
fell
there
on
the
spot
together
with
his
horse
and
while
the
others
also
were
fighting
stesenor
the
despot
of
curion
deserted
them
having
with
him
a
large
force
of
men
now
these
curians
are
said
to
be
settlers
from
argos
and
when
the
curians
had
deserted
forthwith
also
the
of
the
men
of
salamis
proceeded
to
do
the
same
as
the
curians
when
these
things
took
place
the
persians
had
the
advantage
over
the
cyprians
and
after
their
army
had
been
put
to
rout
many
others
fell
and
among
them
onesilos
the
son
of
chersis
he
who
brought
about
the
revolt
of
the
cyprians
and
also
the
king
of
the
solians
aristokypros
the
son
of
philokypros
that
philokypros
whom
solon
the
athenian
when
he
came
to
cyprus
commended
in
verse
above
all
other
despots
so
the
men
of
amathus
cut
off
the
head
of
onesilos
because
he
had
besieged
them
and
having
brought
it
to
amathus
they
hung
it
over
the
gate
of
the
city
and
as
the
head
hung
there
when
it
had
now
become
a
hollow
a
swarm
of
bees
entered
into
it
and
filled
it
with
honeycomb
this
having
so
come
to
pass
the
amathusians
consulted
an
oracle
about
the
head
and
they
received
an
answer
bidding
them
take
it
down
and
bury
it
and
sacrifice
to
onesilos
every
year
as
a
hero
and
if
they
did
this
it
would
go
better
with
them
the
amathusians
accordingly
continued
to
do
so
even
to
my
time
but
the
ionians
who
had
fought
the
in
cyprus
when
they
perceived
that
the
fortunes
of
onesilos
were
ruined
and
that
the
cities
of
the
cyprians
were
besieged
except
salamis
and
that
this
city
had
been
delivered
over
by
the
salaminians
to
gorgos
the
former
king
as
soon
as
they
perceived
this
the
ionians
sailed
away
back
to
ionia
now
of
the
cities
in
cyprus
soloi
held
out
for
the
longest
time
under
the
siege
and
the
persians
took
it
in
the
fifth
month
by
undermining
the
wall
round
the
cyprians
then
after
they
had
made
themselves
free
for
one
year
had
again
been
reduced
to
slavery
afresh
and
meanwhile
daurises
who
was
married
to
a
daughter
of
dareios
and
hymaies
and
otanes
who
were
also
persian
commanders
and
were
married
also
to
daughters
of
dareios
after
they
had
pursued
those
ionians
who
had
made
the
expedition
to
sardis
and
defeating
them
in
battle
had
driven
them
by
force
to
their
ships
after
this
distributed
the
cities
amongst
themselves
and
proceeded
to
sack
them
daurises
directed
his
march
to
the
cities
on
the
hellespont
and
he
took
dardanos
and
abydos
and
percote
and
lampsacos
and
paisos
of
these
he
took
on
each
day
one
and
as
he
was
marching
from
paisos
against
the
city
of
parion
the
report
came
that
the
carians
had
made
common
cause
with
the
ionians
and
were
in
revolt
from
the
persians
he
turned
back
therefore
from
the
hellespont
and
marched
his
army
upon
caria
and
as
it
chanced
a
report
of
this
was
brought
to
the
carians
before
daurises
arrived
and
the
carians
being
informed
of
it
gathered
together
at
the
place
which
is
called
the
white
pillars
and
at
the
river
marsyas
which
flows
from
the
region
of
idrias
and
runs
out
into
the
maiander
when
the
carians
had
been
gathered
together
there
among
many
other
counsels
which
were
given
the
best
as
it
seems
to
me
was
that
of
pixodaros
the
son
of
mausolos
a
man
of
kindye
who
was
married
to
the
daughter
of
the
king
of
the
kilikians
syennesis
the
opinion
of
this
man
was
to
the
effect
that
the
carians
should
cross
over
the
maiander
and
engage
battle
with
the
persians
having
the
river
at
their
backs
in
order
that
the
carians
not
being
able
to
fly
backwards
and
being
compelled
to
remain
where
they
were
might
prove
themselves
even
better
men
in
fight
than
they
naturally
would
this
opinion
did
not
prevail
but
they
resolved
that
the
persians
rather
than
themselves
should
have
the
maiander
at
their
backs
evidently
in
order
that
if
there
should
be
a
flight
of
the
persians
and
they
should
be
worsted
in
the
battle
they
might
never
return
home
but
might
fall
into
the
river
after
this
when
the
persians
had
come
and
had
crossed
the
maiander
the
carians
engaged
with
the
persians
on
the
river
marsyas
and
fought
a
battle
which
was
obstinately
contested
and
lasted
long
but
at
length
they
were
worsted
by
superior
numbers
and
of
the
persians
there
fell
as
many
as
two
thousand
but
of
the
carians
ten
thousand
then
those
of
them
who
escaped
were
shut
up
in
labraunda
within
the
sanctuary
of
zeus
stratios
which
is
a
large
sacred
grove
of
now
the
carians
are
the
only
men
we
know
who
offer
sacrifices
to
zeus
stratios
these
men
then
being
shut
up
there
were
taking
counsel
together
about
their
safety
whether
they
would
fare
better
if
they
delivered
themselves
over
to
the
persians
or
if
they
left
asia
altogether
and
while
they
were
thus
taking
counsel
there
came
to
their
aid
the
milesians
and
their
allies
then
the
carians
dismissed
the
plans
which
they
were
before
considering
and
prepared
to
renew
the
war
again
from
the
beginning
and
when
the
persians
came
to
attack
them
they
engaged
with
them
and
fought
a
battle
and
they
were
worsted
yet
more
completely
than
before
and
while
many
were
slain
of
all
parties
the
milesians
suffered
most
then
afterwards
the
carians
repaired
this
loss
and
retrieved
their
defeat
for
being
informed
that
the
persians
had
set
forth
to
march
upon
their
cities
they
laid
an
ambush
on
the
road
which
is
by
pedasos
and
the
persians
falling
into
it
by
night
were
destroyed
both
they
and
their
commanders
namely
daurises
and
amorges
and
sisimakes
and
with
them
died
also
myrsos
the
son
of
gyges
of
this
ambush
the
leader
was
heracleides
the
son
of
ibanollis
a
man
of
mylasa
these
then
of
the
persians
were
thus
destroyed
and
meanwhile
hymaies
who
was
another
of
those
who
pursued
after
the
ionians
that
had
made
the
expedition
to
sardis
directed
his
march
to
the
propontis
and
took
kios
in
mysia
and
having
conquered
this
city
when
he
was
informed
that
daurises
had
left
the
hellespont
and
was
marching
towards
caria
he
left
the
propontis
and
led
his
army
to
the
hellespont
and
he
conquered
all
the
aiolians
who
occupy
the
district
of
ilion
and
also
the
gergithes
who
were
left
behind
as
a
remnant
of
the
ancient
teucrians
while
conquering
these
tribes
hymaies
himself
ended
his
life
by
sickness
in
the
land
of
troas
he
thus
brought
his
life
to
an
end
and
artaphrenes
the
governor
of
the
province
of
sardis
was
appointed
with
otanes
the
third
of
the
commanders
to
make
the
expedition
against
ionia
and
that
part
of
aiolia
which
bordered
upon
it
of
ionia
these
took
the
city
of
clazomenai
and
of
the
aiolians
kyme
while
the
cities
were
thus
being
taken
aristagoras
the
milesian
being
as
he
proved
in
this
instance
not
of
very
distinguished
courage
since
after
having
disturbed
ionia
and
made
preparation
of
great
matters
he
counselled
running
away
when
he
saw
these
things
moreover
it
had
become
clear
to
him
that
it
was
impossible
to
overcome
king
dareios
he
i
say
having
regard
to
these
things
called
together
those
of
his
own
party
and
took
counsel
with
them
saying
that
it
was
better
that
there
should
be
a
refuge
prepared
for
them
in
case
that
they
should
after
all
be
driven
out
from
miletos
and
proposing
the
question
whether
he
should
lead
them
from
thence
to
sardinia
to
form
a
colony
there
or
to
myrkinos
in
the
land
of
the
edonians
which
histiaios
had
been
fortifying
having
received
it
as
a
gift
from
dareios
this
was
the
question
proposed
by
aristagoras
now
the
opinion
of
hecataios
the
son
of
hegesander
the
historian
was
that
he
should
not
take
a
colony
to
either
of
these
places
but
build
a
wall
of
defence
for
himself
in
the
island
of
leros
and
keep
still
if
he
should
be
forced
to
leave
miletos
and
afterwards
with
this
for
his
starting
point
he
would
be
able
to
return
to
miletos
this
was
the
counsel
of
hecataios
but
aristagoras
was
most
inclined
to
go
forth
to
myrkinos
he
therefore
entrusted
the
government
of
miletos
to
pythagoras
a
man
of
repute
among
the
citizens
and
he
himself
sailed
away
to
thrace
taking
with
him
every
one
who
desired
to
go
and
he
took
possession
of
the
region
for
which
he
had
set
out
but
starting
from
this
to
make
war
he
perished
by
the
hands
of
the
thracians
that
is
both
aristagoras
himself
and
his
army
when
he
was
encamped
about
a
certain
city
and

to
go

from
it

called

aristagoras
accordingly
after
having
caused
ionia
to
revolt
thus
brought
his
life
to
an
end
and
meanwhile
histiaios
the
despot
of
miletos
having
been
let
go
by
dareios
had
arrived
at
sardis
and
when
he
came
from
susa
artaphrenes
the
governor
of
sardis
asked
him
for
what
reason
he
supposed
the
ionians
had
revolted
and
he
said
that
he
could
not
tell
and
moreover
he
expressed
wonder
at
that
which
had
happened
pretending
that
he
knew
nothing
of
the
state
of
affairs
then
artaphrenes
seeing
that
he
was
using
dissimulation
said
having
knowledge
of
the
truth
about
the
revolt
thus
it
is
with
thee
histiaios
about
these
matters
this
shoe
was
stitched
by
thee
and
put
on
by
thus
said
artaphrenes
with
reference
to
the
revolt
and
histiaios
fearing
artaphrenes
because
he
understood
the
matter
ran
away
the
next
night
at
nightfall
and
went
to
the
having
deceived
king
dareios
seeing
that
he
had
engaged
to
subdue
sardinia
the
largest
of
islands
and
instead
of
that
he
was
endeavouring
to
take
upon
himself
leadership
of
the
ionians
in
the
war
against
dareios
then
having
crossed
over
to
chios
he
was
put
in
bonds
by
the
chians
being
accused
by
them
of
working
for
a
change
of
their
state
by
suggestion
of
dareios
when
however
the
chians
learnt
the
whole
story
and
heard
that
he
was
an
enemy
to
the
king
they
released
then
histiaios
being
asked
by
the
ionians
for
what
reason
he
had
so
urgently
charged
aristagoras
to
revolt
from
the
king
and
had
wrought
so
great
an
evil
for
the
ionians
did
not
by
any
means
declare
to
them
that
which
had
been
in
truth
the
cause
but
reported
to
them
that
king
dareios
had
resolved
to
remove
the
phenicians
from
their
land
and
to
settle
them
in
ionia
and
the
ionians
in
phenicia
and
for
this
reason
he
said
he
had
given
the
charge
thus
he
attempted
to
alarm
the
ionians
although
the
king
had
never
resolved
to
do
so
at
all
after
this
histiaios
acting
through
a
messenger
namely
hermippos
a
man
of
atarneus
sent
papers
to
the
persians
who
were
at
sardis
implying
that
he
had
already
talked
matters
over
with
them
about
a
revolt
and
hermippos
did
not
deliver
them
to
those
to
whom
he
was
sent
but
bore
the
papers
and
put
them
into
the
hands
of
artaphrenes
he
then
perceiving
all
that
was
being
done
bade
hermippos
bear
the
papers
sent
by
histiaios
and
deliver
them
to
those
to
whom
he
was
sent
to
bear
them
and
to
deliver
to
him
the
replies
sent
back
by
the
persians
to
histiaios
these
things
having
been
discovered
artaphrenes
upon
that
put
to
death
many
of
the
persians
as
regards
sardis
therefore
there
was
confusion
of
the
design
and
when
histiaios
had
been
disappointed
of
this
hope
the
chians
attempted
to
restore
him
to
miletos
at
the
request
of
histiaios
himself
the
milesians
however
who
had
been
rejoiced
before
to
be
rid
of
aristagoras
were
by
no
means
eager
to
receive
another
despot
into
their
land
seeing
that
they
had
tasted
of
liberty
and
in
fact
histiaios
attempting
to
return
to
miletos
by
force
and
under
cover
of
night
was
wounded
in
the
thigh
by
one
of
the
milesians
he
then
being
repulsed
from
his
own
city
returned
to
chios
and
thence
as
he
could
not
persuade
the
chians
to
give
him
ships
he
crossed
over
to
mytilene
and
endeavoured
to
persuade
the
lesbians
to
give
him
ships
so
they
manned
eight
triremes
and
sailed
with
histiaios
to
byzantion
and
stationing
themselves
there
they
captured
the
ships
which
sailed
out
of
the
pontus
excepting
where
the
crews
of
them
said
that
they
were
ready
to
do
the
bidding
of
histiaios
while
histiaios
and
the
men
of
mytilene
were
acting
thus
a
large
army
both
of
sea
and
land
forces
was
threatening
to
attack
miletos
itself
for
the
commanders
of
the
persians
had
joined
together
to
form
one
single
army
and
were
marching
upon
miletos
considering
the
other
towns
of
less
account
of
their
naval
force
the
most
zealous
were
the
phenicians
and
with
them
also
served
the
cyprians
who
had
just
been
subdued
and
the
kilikians
and
these
i
say
were
advancing
upon
miletos
and
the
rest
of
ionia
and
meanwhile
the
ionians
being
informed
of
this
were
sending
deputies
chosen
from
themselves
to
the
panionion
when
these
had
arrived
at
that
place
and
took
counsel
together
they
resolved
not
to
gather
a
to
oppose
the
persians
but
that
the
milesians
should
defend
their
walls
by
themselves
and
that
the
ionians
should
man
their
fleet
leaving
out
not
one
of
their
ships
and
having
done
so
should
assemble
as
soon
as
possible
at
lade
to
fight
a
in
defence
of
miletos
now
lade
is
a
small
island
lying
opposite
the
city
of
the
then
the
ionians
manned
their
ships
and
came
thither
and
with
them
also
those
aiolians
who
inhabit
lesbos
and
they
were
drawn
up
in
order
thus
the
extremity
of
the
line
towards
the
east
was
held
by
the
milesians
themselves
who
furnished
eighty
ships
next
to
them
were
the
prienians
with
twelve
ships
and
the
men
of
myus
with
three
next
to
those
of
myus
were
the
teians
with
seventeen
ships
and
after
the
teians
the
chians
with
a
hundred
after
these
were
stationed
the
men
of
erythrai
and
of
phocaia
the
former
furnishing
eight
ships
and
the
latter
three
next
to
the
phocaians
were
the
lesbians
with
seventy
ships
and
last
holding
the
extremity
of
the
line
towards
the
west
were
stationed
the
samians
with
sixty
ships
of
all
these
the
total
number
proved
to
be
three
hundred
and
these
were
the
ships
of
the
ionians
and
of
the
barbarians
the
number
of
ships
was
six
hundred
when
these
too
were
come
to
the
milesian
coast
and
their
whole
was
also
there
then
the
commanders
of
the
persians
being
informed
of
the
number
of
the
ionian
ships
were
struck
with
fear
lest
they
should
be
unable
to
overcome
them
and
thus
on
the
one
hand
should
not
be
able
to
conquer
miletos
from
not
having
command
of
the
sea
and
at
the
same
time
should
run
a
risk
of
being
punished
by
dareios
reflecting
upon
these
things
they
gathered
together
the
despots
of
the
ionians
who
were
exiles
with
the
medes
having
been
deposed
from
their
governments
by
aristagoras
the
milesian
and
who
chanced
to
be
then
joining
in
the
expedition
against
miletos
of
these
men
they
called
together
those
who
were
present
and
spoke
to
them
as
follows
ionians
now
let
each
one
of
you
show
himself
a
benefactor
of
the
king
house
that
is
to
say
let
each
one
of
you
endeavour
to
detach
his
own
countrymen
from
the
body
of
the
alliance
and
make
your
proposals
promising
at
the
same
time
that
they
shall
suffer
nothing
unpleasant
on
account
of
the
revolt
and
neither
their
temples
nor
their
private
houses
shall
be
burnt
nor
shall
they
have
any
worse
treatment
than
they
had
before
this
but
if
they
will
not
do
so
but
will
by
all
means
enter
into
a
contest
with
us
threaten
them
and
tell
them
this
which
in
truth
shall
happen
to
them
namely
that
if
they
are
worsted
in
the
fight
they
shall
be
reduced
to
slavery
and
we
shall
make
their
sons
eunuchs
and
their
maidens
we
shall
remove
to
bactria
and
deliver
their
land
to
they
thus
spoke
and
the
despots
of
ionia
sent
each
one
by
night
to
his
own
people
announcing
to
them
this
the
ionians
however
that
is
those
to
whom
these
messages
came
continued
obstinate
and
would
not
accept
the
thought
of
treason
to
their
cause
and
each
people
thought
that
to
them
alone
the
persians
were
sending
this
message
this
happened
as
soon
as
the
persians
came
to
miletos
and
after
this
the
ionians
being
gathered
together
at
lade
held
meetings
and
others
no
doubt
also
made
speeches
to
them
but
especially
the
phocaian
commander
dionysios
who
said
as
follows
seeing
that
our
affairs
are
set
upon
the
razor
edge
ionians
whether
we
shall
be
free
or
slaves
and
slaves
too
to
be
dealt
with
as
runaways
now
therefore
if
ye
shall
be
willing
to
take
upon
yourselves
hardships
ye
will
have
labour
for
the
time
being
but
ye
will
be
able
to
overcome
the
enemy
and
be
free
whereas
if
ye
continue
to
be
and
without
discipline
i
have
no
hope
for
you
that
ye
will
not
pay
the
penalty
to
the
king
for
your
revolt
nay
but
do
as
i
say
and
deliver
yourselves
over
to
me
and
i
engage
if
the
gods
grant
equal
conditions
that
either
the
enemy
will
not
fight
with
us
or
that
fighting
he
shall
be
greatly
hearing
this
the
ionians
delivered
themselves
to
dionysios
and
he
used
to
bring
the
ships
out
every
day
in
single
file
that
he
might
practise
the
rowers
by
making
the
ships
break
through
one
line
and
that
he
might
get
the
in
the
ships
under
arms
an
then
for
the
rest
of
the
day
he
would
keep
the
ships
at
anchor
and
thus
he
gave
the
ionians
work
to
do
during
the
whole
day
for
seven
days
then
they
submitted
and
did
that
which
he
commanded
but
on
the
day
after
these
the
ionians
being
unaccustomed
to
such
toils
and
being
exhausted
with
hard
work
and
hot
sun
spoke
to
one
another
thus
against
which
of
the
deities
have
we
offended
that
we
thus
fill
up
the
measure
of
evil
for
surely
we
have
delivered
ourselves
to
a
phocaian
an
impostor
who
furnishes
but
three
ships
and
he
has
taken
us
into
his
hands
and
maltreats
us
with
evil
dealing
from
which
we
can
never
recover
and
many
of
us
in
fact
have
fallen
into
sicknesses
and
many
others
it
may
be
expected
will
suffer
the
same
thing
shortly
and
for
us
it
is
better
to
endure
anything
else
in
the
world
rather
than
these
ills
and
to
undergo
the
slavery
which
will
come
upon
us
whatever
that
shall
be
rather
than
to
be
oppressed
by
that
which
we
have
now
come
let
us
not
obey
him
after
this
any
more
so
they
said
and
forthwith
after
this
every
one
refused
to
obey
him
and
they
pitched
their
tents
in
the
island
like
an
army
and
kept
in
the
shade
and
would
not
go
on
board
their
ships
or
practise
any
exercises
perceiving
this
which
was
being
done
by
the
ionians
the
commanders
of
the
samians
then
at
length
accepted
from
aiakes
the
son
of
syloson
those
proposals
which
aiakes
sent
before
at
the
bidding
of
the
persians
asking
them
to
leave
the
alliance
of
the
ionians
the
samians
i
say
accepted
these
proposals
perceiving
that
there
was
great
want
of
discipline
on
the
part
of
the
ionians
while
at
the
same
time
it
was
clear
to
them
that
it
was
impossible
to
overcome
the
power
of
the
king
and
they
well
knew
also
that
even
if
they
should
overcome
the
present
naval
force
of
dareios
another
would
be
upon
them
five
times
as
large
having
found
an
occasion
then
so
soon
as
they
saw
that
the
ionians
refused
to
be
serviceable
they
counted
it
gain
for
themselves
to
save
their
temples
and
their
private
property
now
aiakes
from
whom
the
samians
accepted
the
proposals
was
the
son
of
syloson
the
son
of
aiakes
and
being
despot
of
samos
he
had
been
deprived
of
his
rule
by
aristagoras
the
milesian
like
the
other
despots
of
so
when
the
phenicians
sailed
to
the
attack
the
ionians
also
put
out
their
ships
from
shore
against
them
sailing
in
single
file
and
when
they
came
near
and
engaged
battle
with
one
another
as
regards
what
followed
i
am
not
able
exactly
to
record
which
of
the
ionians
showed
themselves
cowards
or
good
men
in
this
for
they
throw
blame
upon
one
another
the
samians
however
it
is
said
according
to
their
agreement
with
aiakes
put
up
their
sails
then
and
set
forth
from
their
place
in
the
line
to
sail
back
to
samos
excepting
only
eleven
ships
of
these
the
captains
stayed
in
their
places
and
took
part
in
the
refusing
to
obey
the
commanders
of
their
division
and
the
public
authority
of
the
samians
granted
them
on
account
of
this
to
have
their
names
written
up
on
a
pillar
with
their
fathers
names
also
as
having
proved
themselves
good
men
and
this
pillar
exists
still
in
the
then
the
lesbians
also
when
they
saw
that
those
next
them
in
order
were
taking
to
flight
did
the
same
things
as
the
samians
had
done
and
so
also
most
of
the
ionians
did
the
very
same
of
those
which
remained
in
their
places
in
the
the
chians
suffered
very
severely
since
they
displayed
brilliant
deeds
of
valour
and
refused
to
play
the
coward
these
furnished
as
was
before
said
a
hundred
ships
and
in
each
of
them
forty
picked
men
of
their
citizens
served
as
and
when
they
saw
the
greater
number
of
their
allies
deserting
them
they
did
not
think
fit
to
behave
like
the
cowards
among
them
but
left
along
with
a
few
only
of
their
allies
they
continued
to
fight
and
kept
breaking
through
the
enemy
line
until
at
last
after
they
had
conquered
many
ships
of
the
enemy
they
lost
the
greater
number
of
their
the
chians
then
with
the
remainder
of
their
ships
fled
away
to
their
own
land
but
those
of
the
chians
whose
ships
were
disabled
by
the
damage
which
they
had
received
being
pursued
fled
for
refuge
to
mycale
and
their
ships
they
ran
ashore
there
and
left
them
behind
while
the
men
proceeded
over
the
mainland
on
foot
and
when
the
chians
had
entered
the
ephesian
territory
on
their
way
then
since
they
came
into
it
by
night
and
at
a
time
when
a
festival
of
thesmophoria
was
being
celebrated
by
the
women
of
the
place
the
ephesians
not
having
heard
beforehand
how
it
was
with
the
chians
and
seeing
that
an
armed
body
had
entered
their
land
supposed
certainly
that
they
were
robbers
and
had
a
design
upon
the
women
so
they
came
out
to
the
rescue
in
a
body
and
slew
the
chians
such
was
the
fortune
which
befell
these
men
but
dionysios
the
phocaian
when
he
perceived
that
the
cause
of
the
ionians
was
ruined
after
having
taken
three
ships
of
the
enemy
sailed
away
not
to
pocaia
any
more
for
he
knew
well
that
it
would
be
reduced
to
slavery
together
with
the
rest
of
ionia
and
he
sailed
forthwith
straight
to
phenicia
and
having
there
sunk
merchant
ships
and
taken
a
great
quantity
of
goods
he
sailed
thence
to
sicily
then
with
that
for
his
he
became
a
freebooter
not
plundering
any
hellenes
but
carthaginians
and
tyrsenians
only
the
persians
then
being
conquerors
of
the
ionians
in
the
besieged
miletos
by
land
and
sea
undermining
the
walls
and
bringing
against
it
all
manner
of
engines
and
they
took
it
completely
in
the
sixth
year
from
the
revolt
of
aristagoras
and
reduced
the
people
to
slavery
so
that
the
disaster
agreed
with
the
oracle
which
had
been
uttered
with
reference
to
for
when
the
argives
were
inquiring
at
delphi
about
the
safety
of
their
city
there
was
given
to
them
an
oracle
which
applied
to
both
that
is
to
say
part
of
it
had
reference
to
the
argives
themselves
while
that
which
was
added
afterwards
referred
to
the
milesians
the
part
of
it
which
had
reference
to
the
argives
i
will
record
when
i
reach
that
place
in
the
history
but
that
which
the
oracle
uttered
with
reference
to
the
milesians
who
were
not
there
present
is
as
follows
and
at
that
time
o
miletos
of
evil
deeds
the
contriver
thou
shalt
be
made
for
many
a
glorious
gift
and
a
banquet
then
shall
thy
wives
be
compelled
to
wash
the
feet
of
the
and
in
didyma
then
my
shrine
shall
be
tended
by
others
at
the
time
of
which
i
speak
these
things
came
upon
the
milesians
since
most
of
the
men
were
killed
by
the
persians
who
are
and
the
women
and
children
were
dealt
with
as
slaves
and
the
temple
at
didyma
with
the
sacred
building
and
the
sanctuary
of
the
oracle
was
first
plundered
and
then
burnt
of
the
things
in
this
temple
i
have
made
mention
frequently
in
other
parts
of
the
history
after
this
the
milesians
who
had
been
taken
prisoner
were
conducted
to
susa
and
king
dareios
did
to
them
no
other
evil
but
settled
them
upon
the
sea
called
erythraian
in
the
city
of
ampe
by
which
the
tigris
flows
when
it
runs
out
into
the
sea
of
the
milesian
land
the
persians
themselves
kept
the
surroundings
of
the
city
and
the
plain
but
the
heights
they
gave
to
the
carians
of
pedasa
for
a
possession
when
the
milesians
suffered
this
treatment
from
the
persians
the
men
of
sybaris
who
were
dwelling
in
laos
and
skidros
being
deprived
of
their
own
city
did
not
repay
like
with
like
for
when
sybaris
was
taken
by
the
men
of
croton
the
milesians
all
from
youth
upwards
shaved
their
heads
and
put
on
great
mourning
for
these
cities
were
more
than
all
others
of
which
we
know
bound
together
by
ties
of
friendship
not
like
the
sybarites
were
the
athenians
for
these
made
it
clear
that
they
were
grieved
at
the
capture
of
miletos
both
in
many
other
ways
and
also
by
this
that
when
phrynichos
had
composed
a
drama
called
the
capture
of
miletos
and
had
put
it
on
the
stage
the
body
of
spectators
fell
to
weeping
and
the
athenians
moreover
fined
the
poet
a
thousand
drachmas
on
the
ground
that
he
had
reminded
them
of
their
own
calamities
and
they
ordered
also
that
no
one
in
future
should
represent
this
drama
miletos
then
had
been
stripped
bare
of
its
former
inhabitants
but
of
the
samians
they
who
had
substance
were
by
no
means
satisfied
with
that
which
had
been
concerted
by
the
commanders
of
their
fleet
with
the
medes
and
taking
counsel
forthwith
after
the
it
seemed
good
to
them
before
their
despot
aiakes
arrived
in
the
country
to
sail
away
and
make
a
colony
and
not
to
stay
behind
and
be
slaves
of
the
medes
and
of
aiakes
for
just
at
this
time
the
people
of
zancle
in
sicily
were
sending
messengers
to
ionia
and
inviting
the
ionians
to
come
to
the
fair
strand
desiring
there
to
found
a
city
of
ionians
now
this
which
is
called
the
fair
strand
is
in
the
land
of
the
sikelians
and
on
that
side
of
sicily
which
lies
towards
tyrsenia
so
when
these
gave
the
invitation
the
samians
alone
of
all
the
ionians
set
forth
having
with
them
those
of
the
milesians
who
had
escaped
and
in
the
course
of
this
matter
it
happened
as
follows
the
samians
as
they
made
their
way
towards
sicily
reached
locroi
epizephyroi
and
at
the
same
time
the
people
of
zancle
both
themselves
and
their
king
whose
name
was
skythes
were
encamped
about
a
city
of
the
sikelians
desiring
to
conquer
it
perceiving
these
things
anaxilaos
the
despot
of
rhegion
being
then
at
variance
with
those
of
zancle
communicated
with
the
samians
and
persuaded
them
that
they
ought
to
leave
the
fair
strand
alone
to
which
they
were
sailing
and
take
possession
of
zancle
instead
since
it
was
left
now
without
men
to
defend
it
the
samians
accordingly
did
as
he
said
and
took
possession
of
zancle
and
upon
this
the
men
of
zancle
being
informed
that
their
city
was
possessed
by
an
enemy
set
out
to
rescue
it
and
invited
hippocrates
the
despot
of
gela
to
help
them
for
he
was
their
ally
when
however
hippocrates
also
with
his
army
had
come
up
to
their
rescue
first
he
put
skythes
the
ruler
of
the
zanclaians
in
fetters
on
the
ground
that
he
had
been
the
cause
of
the
city
being
lost
and
together
with
him
his
brother
pythogenes
and
sent
them
away
to
the
town
of
incyos
then
he
betrayed
the
cause
of
the
remaining
zanclaians
by
coming
to
terms
with
the
samians
and
exchanging
oaths
with
them
and
in
return
for
this
it
had
been
promised
by
the
samians
that
hippocrates
should
receive
as
his
share
the
half
of
all
the
movable
goods
in
the
city
and
of
the
slaves
and
the
whole
of
the
property
in
the
fields
round
so
the
greater
number
of
the
zanclaians
he
put
in
bonds
and
kept
himself
as
slaves
but
the
chief
men
of
them
three
hundred
in
number
he
gave
to
the
samians
to
put
to
death
which
however
the
samians
did
not
do
now
skythes
the
ruler
of
the
zanclaians
escaped
from
incyos
to
himera
and
thence
he
came
to
asia
and
went
up
to
the
court
of
dareios
and
dareios
accounted
him
the
most
righteous
of
all
the
men
who
had
come
up
to
him
from
hellas
for
he
obtained
leave
of
the
king
and
went
away
to
sicily
and
again
came
back
from
sicily
to
the
king
and
at
last
he
brought
his
life
to
an
end
among
the
persians
in
old
age
and
possessing
great
wealth
the
samians
then
having
got
rid
of
the
rule
of
the
medes
had
gained
for
themselves
without
labour
the
fair
city
of
zancle
after
the
which
was
fought
for
miletos
the
phenicians
by
the
command
of
the
persians
restored
to
samos
aiakes
the
son
of
syloson
since
he
had
been
to
them
of
much
service
and
had
done
for
them
great
things
and
the
samians
alone
of
all
who
revolted
from
dareios
because
of
the
desertion
of
their
ships
which
were
in
the
had
neither
their
city
nor
their
temples
burnt
then
after
the
capture
of
miletos
the
persians
forthwith
got
possession
of
caria
some
of
the
cities
having
submitted
to
their
power
voluntarily
while
others
of
them
they
brought
over
by
force
thus
it
came
to
pass
as
regards
these
matters
and
meanwhile
histiaios
the
milesian
who
was
at
byzantion
and
was
seizing
the
merchant
vessels
of
the
ionians
as
they
sailed
forth
out
of
the
pontus
received
the
report
of
that
which
had
happened
about
miletos
upon
that
he
entrusted
the
matters
which
had
to
do
with
the
hellespont
to
bisaltes
the
son
of
apollophanes
a
man
of
abydos
while
he
himself
with
the
lesbians
sailed
to
chios
and
when
a
body
of
the
chians
who
were
on
guard
did
not
allow
him
to
approach
he
fought
with
them
at
that
spot
in
the
chian
land
which
is
called
the
hollows
histiaios
then
not
only
slew
many
of
these
but
also
taking
polichne
of
the
chians
as
his
base
he
conquered
with
the
help
of
the
lesbians
the
remainder
of
the
chians
as
well
since
they
had
suffered
great
loss
by
the
and
heaven
is
wont
perhaps
to
give
signs
beforehand
whenever
great
evils
are
about
to
happen
to
a
city
or
a
race
of
men
for
to
the
chians
also
before
these
events
remarkable
signs
had
come
in
the
first
place
when
they
had
sent
to
delphi
a
chorus
of
a
hundred
youths
two
only
returned
home
the
remaining
of
them
having
been
seized
by
a
plague
and
carried
off
and
then
secondly
in
their
city
about
the
same
time
that
is
shortly
before
the
as
some
children
were
being
taught
in
school
the
roof
fell
in
upon
them
so
that
of
a
hundred
and
twenty
children
only
one
escaped
these
signs
god
showed
to
them
beforehand
and
after
this
the
came
upon
them
and
brought
their
state
down
upon
its
knees
and
as
the
chians
had
suffered
great
loss
he
without
difficulty
effected
the
conquest
of
them
thence
histiaios
made
an
expedition
against
thasos
taking
with
him
a
large
force
of
ionians
and
aiolians
and
while
he
was
encamped
about
the
town
of
thasos
a
report
came
to
him
that
the
phenicians
were
sailing
up
from
miletos
to
conquer
the
rest
of
ionia
being
informed
of
this
he
left
thasos
unconquered
and
himself
hastened
to
lesbos
taking
with
him
his
whole
army
then
as
his
army
was
in
want
of
food
he
crossed
over
from
lesbos
to
reap
the
corn
in
atarneus
and
also
that
in
the
plain
of
the
caïcos
which
belonged
to
the
mysians
in
these
parts
there
chanced
to
be
a
persian
named
harpagos
commanding
a
considerable
force
and
this
man
fought
a
battle
with
him
after
he
had
landed
and
he
took
histiaios
himself
prisoner
and
destroyed
the
greater
part
of
his
and
histiaios
was
taken
prisoner
in
the
following
manner
as
the
hellenes
were
fighting
with
the
persians
at
malene
in
the
district
of
atarneus
after
they
had
been
engaged
in
close
combat
for
a
long
time
the
cavalry
at
length
charged
and
fell
upon
the
hellenes
and
the
cavalry
in
fact
decided
the
battle
so
when
the
hellenes
had
been
turned
to
flight
histiaios
trusting
that
he
would
not
be
put
to
death
by
the
king
on
account
of
his
present
fault
conceived
a
love
of
life
so
that
when
he
was
being
caught
in
his
flight
by
a
persian
and
was
about
to
be
run
through
by
him
in
the
moment
of
his
capture
he
spoke
in
persian
and
made
himself
known
saying
that
he
was
histiaios
the
if
then
upon
being
taken
prisoner
he
had
been
brought
to
king
dareios
he
would
not
as
i
think
have
suffered
any
harm
but
dareios
would
have
forgiven
the
crime
with
which
he
was
charged
as
it
was
however
for
this
very
reason
and
in
order
that
he
might
not
escape
from
punishment
and
again
become
powerful
with
the
king
artaphrenes
the
governor
of
sardis
and
harpagos
who
had
captured
him
when
he
had
reached
sardis
on
his
way
to
the
king
put
him
to
death
there
and
then
and
his
body
they
impaled
but
embalmed
his
head
and
brought
it
up
to
dareios
at
susa
dareios
having
been
informed
of
this
found
fault
with
those
who
had
done
so
because
they
had
not
brought
him
up
to
his
presence
alive
and
he
bade
wash
the
head
of
histiaios
and
bestow
upon
it
proper
care
and
then
bury
it
as
that
of
one
who
had
been
greatly
a
benefactor
both
of
the
king
himself
and
of
the
persians
thus
it
happened
about
histiaios
and
meanwhile
the
persian
fleet
after
wintering
near
miletos
when
it
put
to
sea
again
in
the
following
year
conquered
without
difficulty
the
islands
lying
near
the
mainland
chios
lesbos
and
tenedos
and
whenever
they
took
one
of
the
islands
the
barbarians
as
each
was
conquered
swept
the
inhabitants
off
it
and
this
they
do
in
the
following
manner
they
extend
themselves
from
the
sea
on
the
north
to
the
sea
on
the
south
each
man
having
hold
of
the
hand
of
the
next
and
then
they
pass
through
the
whole
island
hunting
the
people
out
of
it
they
took
also
the
ionian
cities
on
the
mainland
in
the
same
manner
except
that
they
did
not
sweep
off
the
inhabitants
thus
for
it
was
not
then
the
commanders
of
the
persians
proved
not
false
to
the
threats
with
which
they
had
threatened
the
ionians
when
these
were
encamped
opposite
to
them
for
in
fact
when
they
conquered
the
cities
they
chose
out
the
most
comely
of
the
boys
and
castrated
them
making
eunuchs
of
them
and
the
fairest
of
the
maidens
they
carried
off
by
force
to
the
king
and
not
only
this
but
they
also
burnt
the
cities
together
with
the
temples
thus
for
the
third
time
had
the
ionians
been
reduced
to
slavery
first
by
the
lydians
and
then
twice
in
succession
by
the
persians
departing
from
ionia
the
fleet
proceeded
to
conquer
all
the
places
of
the
hellespont
on
the
left
as
one
sails
in
for
those
on
the
right
had
been
subdued
already
by
the
persians
themselves
approaching
them
by
land
now
the
cities
of
the
hellespont
in
europe
are
these
first
comes
the
chersonese
in
which
there
are
many
cities
then
perinthos
the
strongholds
of
the
thracian
border
selymbria
and
byzantion
the
people
of
byzantion
and
those
of
calchedon
opposite
did
not
even
wait
for
the
coming
of
the
persian
ships
but
had
left
their
own
land
first
and
departed
going
within
the
euxine
and
there
they
settled
in
the
city
of
mesambria
so
the
phenicians
having
burnt
these
places
which
have
been
mentioned
directed
their
course
next
to
proconnesos
and
artake
and
when
they
had
delivered
these
also
to
the
flames
they
sailed
back
to
the
chersonese
to
destroy
the
remaining
cities
which
they
had
not
sacked
when
they
touched
there
before
but
against
kyzicos
they
did
not
sail
at
all
for
the
men
of
kyzicos
even
before
the
time
when
the
phenicians
sailed
in
had
submitted
to
the
king
of
their
own
accord
and
had
made
terms
with
oibares
the
son
of
megabazos
the
persian
governor
at
daskyleion
in
the
chersonese
then
the
phenicians
made
themselves
masters
of
all
the
other
cities
except
the
city
of
cardia
of
these
cities
up
to
that
time
miltiades
the
son
of
kimon
the
son
of
stesagoras
had
been
despot
miltiades
the
son
of
kypselos
having
obtained
this
government
in
the
manner
which
here
follows
the
inhabitants
of
this
chersonese
were
dolonkian
thracians
and
these
dolonkians
being
hard
pressed
in
war
by
the
apsinthians
sent
their
kings
to
delphi
to
consult
the
oracle
about
the
war
and
the
pythian
prophetess
answered
them
that
they
must
bring
into
their
land
as
founder
of
a
settlement
the
man
who
should
first
offer
them
hospitality
as
they
returned
from
the
temple
the
dolonkians
then
passed
along
the
sacred
road
through
the
land
of
the
phokians
and
of
the
boeotians
and
as
no
man
invited
them
they
turned
aside
and
came
to
now
at
that
time
in
athens
the
government
was
held
by
peisistratos
but
miltiades
also
the
son
of
kypselos
had
some
power
who
belonged
to
a
family
which
kept
chariot
teams
and
who
was
descended
originally
from
aiacos
and
egina
though
in
more
recent
times
his
family
was
athenian
philaios
the
son
of
ajax
having
been
the
first
of
his
house
who
became
an
athenian
this
miltiades
was
sitting
in
the
entrance
of
his
own
dwelling
and
seeing
the
dolonkians
going
by
with
dress
that
was
not
of
the
native
athenian
fashion
and
with
spears
he
shouted
to
them
and
when
they
approached
he
offered
them
lodging
and
hospitality
they
then
having
accepted
and
having
been
entertained
by
him
proceeded
to
declare
all
the
utterances
of
the
oracle
and
having
declared
it
they
asked
him
to
do
as
the
god
had
said
and
miltiades
when
he
heard
it
was
at
once
disposed
to
agree
because
he
was
vexed
by
the
rule
of
peisistratos
and
desired
to
be
removed
out
of
the
way
he
set
out
therefore
forthwith
to
delphi
to
inquire
of
the
oracle
whether
he
should
do
that
which
the
dolonkians
asked
of
him
and
as
the
pythian
prophetess
also
bade
him
do
so
miltiades
the
son
of
kypselos
who
had
before
this
been
victor
at
olympia
with
a
chariot
now
taking
with
him
of
the
athenians
everyone
who
desired
to
share
in
the
expedition
sailed
with
the
dolonkians
and
took
possession
of
the
land
and
they
who
had
invited
him
to
come
to
them
made
him
despot
over
them
first
then
he
made
a
wall
across
the
isthmus
of
the
chersonese
from
the
city
of
cardia
to
pactye
in
order
that
the
apsinthians
might
not
be
able
to
invade
the
land
and
do
them
damage
now
the
number
of
furlongs
across
the
isthmus
at
this
place
is
and
from
this
isthmus
the
chersonese
within
is
altogether
four
hundred
and
twenty
furlongs
in
having
made
a
wall
then
across
the
neck
of
the
chersonese
and
having
in
this
manner
repelled
the
apsinthians
miltiades
made
war
upon
the
people
of
lampsacos
first
of
all
others
and
the
people
of
lampsacos
laid
an
ambush
and
took
him
prisoner
now
miltiades
had
come
to
be
a
friend
of
croesus
the
lydian
and
croesus
accordingly
being
informed
of
this
event
sent
and
commanded
the
people
of
lampsacos
to
let
miltiades
go
otherwise
he
threatened
to
destroy
them
utterly
like
a
then
when
the
people
of
lampsacos
were
perplexed
in
their
counsels
as
to
what
that
saying
should
mean
with
which
croesus
had
threatened
them
namely
that
he
would
destroy
them
utterly
like
a
at
length
one
of
the
elder
men
with
difficulty
perceived
the
truth
and
said
that
a
pine
alone
of
all
trees
when
it
has
been
cut
down
does
not
put
forth
any
further
growth
but
perishes
being
utterly
destroyed
the
people
of
lampsacos
therefore
fearing
croesus
loosed
miltiades
and
let
him
he
then
escaped
by
means
of
croesus
but
afterwards
he
brought
his
life
to
an
end
leaving
no
son
to
succeed
him
but
passing
over
his
rule
and
his
possessions
to
stesagoras
who
was
the
son
of
kimon
his
brother
on
the
mother
side
and
the
people
of
the
chersonese
still
offer
sacrifices
to
him
after
his
death
as
it
is
usual
to
do
to
a
founder
and
hold
in
his
honour
a
contest
of
and
athletic
exercises
in
which
none
of
the
men
of
lampsacos
are
allowed
to
contend
after
this
there
was
war
with
those
of
lampsacos
and
it
happened
to
stesagoras
also
that
he
died
without
leaving
a
son
having
been
struck
on
the
head
with
an
axe
in
the
city
hall
by
a
man
who
pretended
to
be
a
deserter
but
who
proved
himself
to
be
in
fact
an
enemy
and
a
rather
hot
one
then
after
stesagoras
also
had
ended
his
life
in
this
manner
miltiades
son
of
kimon
and
brother
of
that
stesagoras
who
was
dead
was
sent
in
a
trireme
to
the
chersonese
to
take
possession
of
the
government
by
the
sons
of
peisistratos
who
had
dealt
well
with
him
at
athens
also
pretending
that
they
had
had
no
share
in
the
death
of
his
father
kimon
of
which
in
another
part
of
the
history
i
will
set
forth
how
it
came
to
pass
now
miltiades
when
he
came
to
the
chersonese
kept
himself
within
his
house
paying
honours
in
all
appearance
to
the
memory
of
his
brother
stesagoras
and
the
chief
men
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
chersonese
in
every
place
being
informed
of
this
gathered
themselves
together
from
all
the
cities
and
came
in
a
body
to
condole
with
him
and
when
they
had
come
they
were
laid
in
bonds
by
him
miltiades
then
was
in
possession
of
the
chersonese
supporting
a
body
of
five
hundred
mercenary
troops
and
he
married
the
daughter
of
oloros
the
king
of
the
thracians
who
was
named
hegesipyle
now
this
miltiades
son
of
kimon
had
at
the
time
of
which
we
speak
but
lately
returned
to
the
chersonese
and
after
he
had
returned
there
befell
him
other
misfortunes
worse
than
those
which
had
befallen
him
already
for
two
years
before
this
he
had
been
a
fugitive
out
of
the
land
from
the
scythians
since
the
nomad
scythians
provoked
by
king
dareios
had
joined
all
in
a
body
and
marched
as
far
as
this
chersonese
and
miltiades
had
not
awaited
their
attack
but
had
become
a
fugitive
from
the
chersonese
until
at
last
the
scythians
departed
and
the
dolonkians
brought
him
back
again
these
things
happened
two
years
before
the
calamities
which
now
oppressed
him
and
now
being
informed
that
the
phenicians
were
at
tenedos
he
filled
five
triremes
with
the
property
which
he
had
at
hand
and
sailed
away
for
athens
and
having
set
out
from
the
city
of
cardia
he
was
sailing
through
the
gulf
of
melas
and
as
he
passed
along
by
the
shore
of
the
chersonese
the
phenicians
fell
in
with
his
ships
and
while
miltiades
himself
with
four
of
his
ships
escaped
to
imbros
the
fifth
of
his
ships
was
captured
in
the
pursuit
by
the
phenicians
of
this
ship
it
chanced
that
metiochos
the
eldest
of
the
sons
of
miltiades
was
in
command
not
born
of
the
daughter
of
oloros
the
thracian
but
of
another
woman
him
the
phenicians
captured
together
with
his
ship
and
being
informed
about
him
that
he
was
the
son
of
miltiades
they
brought
him
up
to
the
king
supposing
that
they
would
lay
up
for
themselves
a
great
obligation
because
it
was
miltiades
who
had
declared
as
his
opinion
to
the
ionians
that
they
should
do
as
the
scythians
said
at
that
time
when
the
scythians
requested
them
to
break
up
the
bridge
of
boats
and
sail
away
to
their
own
land
dareios
however
when
the
phenicians
brought
up
to
him
metiochos
the
son
of
miltiades
did
metiochos
no
harm
but
on
the
contrary
very
much
good
for
he
gave
him
a
house
and
possessions
and
a
persian
wife
by
whom
he
had
children
born
who
have
been
ranked
as
persians
miltiades
meanwhile
came
from
imbros
to
athens
in
the
course
of
this
year
there
was
done
by
the
persians
nothing
more
which
tended
to
strife
with
the
ionians
but
these
things
which
follow
were
done
in
this
year
very
much
to
their
artaphrenes
the
governor
of
sardis
sent
for
envoys
from
all
the
cities
and
compelled
the
ionians
to
make
agreements
among
themselves
so
that
they
might
give
satisfaction
for
wrongs
and
not
plunder
one
another
land
this
he
compelled
them
to
do
and
also
he
measured
their
territories
by
parasangs
that
is
the
name
which
the
persians
give
to
the
length
of
thirty
furlongs
he
measured
i
say
by
these
and
appointed
a
certain
amount
of
tribute
for
each
people
which
continues
still
unaltered
from
that
time
even
to
my
own
days
as
it
was
appointed
by
artaphrenes
and
the
tribute
was
appointed
to
be
nearly
of
the
same
amount
for
each
as
it
had
been
these
were
things
which
tended
to
peace
for
the
ionians
but
at
the
beginning
of
the
spring
the
other
commanders
having
all
been
removed
by
the
king
mardonios
the
son
of
gobryas
came
down
to
the
sea
bringing
with
him
a
very
large
and
a
very
large
naval
force
being
a
young
man
and
lately
married
to
artozostra
daughter
of
king
dareios
when
mardonios
leading
this
army
came
to
kilikia
he
embarked
on
board
a
ship
himself
and
proceeded
together
with
the
other
ships
while
other
leaders
led
the
to
the
hellespont
mardonios
however
sailing
along
the
coast
of
asia
came
to
ionia
and
here
i
shall
relate
a
thing
which
will
be
a
great
marvel
to
those
of
the
hellenes
who
do
not
believe
that
to
the
seven
men
of
the
persians
otanes
declared
as
his
opinion
that
the
persians
ought
to
have
popular
rule
for
mardonios
deposed
all
the
despots
of
the
ionians
and
established
popular
governments
in
the
cities
having
so
done
he
hastened
on
to
the
hellespont
and
when
there
was
collected
a
vast
number
of
ships
and
a
large
they
crossed
over
the
hellespont
in
the
ships
and
began
to
make
their
way
through
europe
and
their
way
was
directed
against
eretria
and
these
i
say
furnished
them
the
pretence
for
the
expedition
but
they
had
it
in
their
minds
to
subdue
as
many
as
they
could
of
the
hellenic
cities
and
in
the
first
place
they
subdued
with
their
ships
the
thasians
who
did
not
even
raise
a
hand
to
defend
themselves
then
with
the
they
gained
the
macedonians
to
be
their
servants
in
addition
to
those
whom
they
had
already
for
all
the
nations
on
the
east
of
the
macedonians
had
become
subject
to
them
already
before
this
crossing
over
then
from
thasos
to
the
opposite
coast
they
proceeded
on
their
way
near
the
land
as
far
as
acanthos
and
then
starting
from
acanthos
they
attempted
to
get
round
mount
athos
but
as
they
sailed
round
there
fell
upon
them
a
violent
north
wind
against
which
they
could
do
nothing
and
handled
them
very
roughly
casting
away
very
many
of
their
ships
on
mount
athos
it
is
said
indeed
that
the
number
of
the
ships
destroyed
was
three
hundred
and
more
than
twenty
thousand
men
for
as
this
sea
which
is
about
athos
is
very
full
of
sea
monsters
some
were
seized
by
these
and
so
perished
while
others
were
dashed
against
the
rocks
and
some
of
them
did
not
know
how
to
swim
and
perished
for
that
cause
others
again
by
reason
of
thus
fared
the
fleet
and
meanwhile
mardonios
and
the
while
encamping
in
macedonia
were
attacked
in
the
night
by
the
brygian
thracians
and
many
of
them
were
slain
by
the
brygians
and
mardonios
himself
was
wounded
however
not
even
these
escaped
being
enslaved
by
the
persians
for
mardonios
did
not
depart
from
that
region
until
he
had
made
them
subject
but
when
he
had
subdued
these
he
proceeded
to
lead
his
army
back
since
he
had
suffered
great
loss
with
his
in
fighting
against
the
brygians
and
with
his
fleet
in
going
round
athos
so
this
expedition
departed
back
to
asia
having
gained
no
honour
by
its
contests
in
the
next
year
after
this
dareios
first
sent
a
messenger
to
the
men
of
thasos
who
had
been
accused
by
their
neighbours
of
planning
revolt
and
bade
them
take
away
the
wall
around
their
town
and
bring
their
ships
to
abdera
the
thasians
in
fact
as
they
had
been
besieged
by
histiaios
the
milesian
and
at
the
same
time
had
large
revenues
coming
in
were
using
their
money
in
building
ships
of
war
and
in
surrounding
their
city
with
a
stronger
wall
now
the
revenues
came
to
them
from
the
mainland
and
from
the
mines
from
the
in
scapte
hyle
there
came
in
generally
eighty
talents
a
year
and
from
those
in
thasos
itself
a
smaller
amount
than
this
but
so
much
that
in
general
the
thasians
without
taxes
upon
the
produce
of
their
soil
had
a
revenue
from
the
mainland
and
from
the
mines
amounting
yearly
to
two
hundred
talents
and
when
the
amount
was
highest
to
three
i
myself
saw
these
mines
and
by
much
the
most
marvellous
of
them
were
those
which
the
phenicians
discovered
who
made
the
first
settlement
in
this
island
in
company
with
thasos
and
the
island
had
the
name
which
it
now
has
from
this
thasos
the
phenician
these
phenician
mines
are
in
that
part
of
thasos
which
is
between
the
places
called
ainyra
and
koinyra
and
opposite
samothrake
where
there
is
a
great
mountain
which
has
been
all
turned
up
in
the
search
for
metal
thus
it
is
with
this
matter
and
the
thasians
on
the
command
of
the
king
both
razed
their
walls
and
brought
all
their
ships
to
abdera
after
this
dareios
began
to
make
trial
of
the
hellenes
what
they
meant
to
do
whether
to
make
war
with
him
or
to
deliver
themselves
up
he
sent
abroad
heralds
therefore
and
appointed
them
to
go
some
to
one
place
and
others
to
another
throughout
hellas
bidding
them
demand
earth
and
water
for
the
king
these
i
say
he
sent
to
hellas
and
meanwhile
he
was
sending
abroad
other
heralds
to
his
own
tributary
cities
which
lay
upon
the
and
he
bade
them
have
ships
of
war
built
and
also
vessels
to
carry
they
then
were
engaged
in
preparing
these
things
and
meanwhile
when
the
heralds
had
come
to
hellas
many
of
those
who
dwelt
upon
the
mainland
gave
that
for
which
the
persian
made
demand
and
all
those
who
dwelt
in
the
islands
did
so
to
whomsoever
they
came
to
make
their
demand
the
islanders
i
say
gave
earth
and
water
to
dareios
and
among
them
also
those
of
egina
and
when
these
had
done
so
the
athenians
went
forthwith
urgent
against
them
supposing
that
the
eginetans
had
given
with
hostile
purpose
against
themselves
in
order
to
make
an
expedition
against
them
in
combination
with
the
persians
and
also
they
were
glad
to
get
hold
of
an
occasion
against
them
accordingly
they
went
backward
and
forwards
to
sparta
and
accused
the
eginetans
of
that
which
they
had
done
as
having
proved
themselves
traitors
to
in
consequence
of
this
accusation
cleomenes
the
son
of
anaxandrides
king
of
the
spartans
crossed
over
to
egina
meaning
to
seize
those
of
the
eginetans
who
were
the
most
guilty
but
as
he
was
attempting
to
seize
them
certain
of
the
eginetans
opposed
him
and
among
them
especially
crios
the
son
of
polycritos
who
said
that
he
should
not
with
impunity
carry
off
a
single
eginetan
for
he
was
doing
this
said
he
without
authority
from
the
spartan
state
having
been
persuaded
to
it
by
the
athenians
with
money
otherwise
he
would
have
come
and
seized
them
in
company
with
the
other
king
and
this
he
said
by
reason
of
a
message
received
from
demaratos
cleomenes
then
as
he
departed
from
egina
asked
crios
what
was
his
name
and
he
told
him
the
truth
and
cleomenes
said
to
him
surely
now
o
ram
thou
must
cover
over
thy
horns
with
bronze
for
thou
wilt
shortly
have
a
great
trouble
to
contend
with
meanwhile
demaratos
the
son
of
ariston
was
staying
behind
in
sparta
and
bringing
charges
against
cleomenes
he
also
being
king
of
the
spartans
but
of
the
inferior
house
which
however
is
inferior
in
no
other
way
for
it
is
descended
from
the
same
ancestor
but
the
house
of
eurysthenes
has
always
been
honoured
more
apparently
because
he
was
the
elder
for
the
lacedemonians
who
herein
agree
with
none
of
the
poets
say
that
aristodemos
the
son
of
aristomachos
the
son
of
cleodaios
the
son
of
hyllos
being
their
king
led
them
himself
and
not
the
sons
of
aristodemos
to
this
land
which
they
now
possess
then
after
no
long
time
the
wife
of
aristodemos
whose
name
was
argeia
she
was
the
daughter
they
say
of
autesion
the
son
of
tisamenes
the
son
of
thersander
the
son
of
polyneikes
she
it
is
said
brought
forth
twins
and
aristodemos
lived
but
to
see
his
children
and
then
ended
his
life
by
sickness
so
the
lacedemonians
of
that
time
resolved
according
to
established
custom
to
make
the
elder
of
the
children
their
king
but
they
did
not
know
which
of
them
they
should
take
because
they
were
like
one
another
and
of
equal
size
and
when
they
were
not
able
to
make
out
or
even
before
this
they
inquired
of
their
mother
and
she
said
that
even
she
herself
did
not
know
one
from
the
other
she
said
this
although
she
knew
in
truth
very
well
because
she
desired
that
by
some
means
both
might
be
made
kings
the
lacedemonians
then
were
in
a
strait
and
being
in
a
strait
they
sent
to
delphi
to
inquire
what
they
should
do
in
the
matter
and
the
pythian
prophetess
bade
them
regard
both
children
as
their
kings
but
honour
most
the
first
in
age
the
prophetess
they
say
thus
gave
answer
to
them
and
when
the
lacedemonians
were
at
a
loss
none
the
less
how
to
find
out
the
elder
of
them
a
messenian
whose
name
was
panites
made
a
suggestion
to
them
this
panites
i
say
suggested
to
the
lacedemonians
that
they
should
watch
the
mother
and
see
which
of
the
children
she
washed
and
fed
before
the
other
and
if
she
was
seen
to
do
this
always
in
the
same
order
then
they
would
have
all
that
they
were
seeking
and
desiring
to
find
out
but
if
she
too
was
uncertain
and
did
it
in
a
different
order
at
different
times
it
would
be
plain
to
them
that
even
she
had
no
more
knowledge
than
any
other
and
they
must
turn
to
some
other
way
then
the
spartans
following
the
suggestion
of
the
messenian
watched
the
mother
of
the
sons
of
aristodemos
and
found
that
she
gave
honour
thus
to
the
both
in
feeding
and
in
washing
for
she
did
not
know
with
that
design
she
was
being
watched
they
took
therefore
the
child
which
was
honoured
by
its
mother
and
brought
it
up
as
the
in
the
public
hall
and
to
it
was
given
the
name
of
eurysthenes
while
the
other
was
called
procles
these
when
they
had
grown
up
both
themselves
were
at
variance
they
say
with
one
another
though
they
were
brothers
throughout
the
whole
time
of
their
lives
and
their
descendants
also
continued
after
the
same
manner
this
is
the
report
given
by
the
lacedemonians
alone
of
all
the
hellenes
but
this
which
follows
i
write
in
accordance
with
that
which
is
reported
by
the
hellenes
generally
i
mean
that
the
names
of
these
kings
of
the
dorians
are
rightly
enumerated
by
the
hellenes
up
to
perseus
the
son
of
danae
leaving
the
god
out
of
account
and
proved
to
be
of
hellenic
race
for
even
from
that
time
they
were
reckoned
as
hellenes
i
said
up
to
perseus
and
did
not
take
the
descent
from
a
yet
higher
point
because
there
is
no
name
mentioned
of
a
mortal
father
for
perseus
as
amphitryon
is
for
heracles
therefore
with
reason
as
is
evident
i
have
said
rightly
up
to
perseus
but
if
one
enumerates
their
ancestors
in
succession
going
back
from
danae
the
daughter
of
acrisios
the
rulers
of
the
dorians
will
prove
to
be
egyptians
by
direct
thus
i
have
traced
the
descent
according
to
the
account
given
by
the
hellenes
but
as
the
story
is
reported
which
the
persians
tell
perseus
himself
was
an
assyrian
and
became
a
hellene
whereas
the
ancestors
of
perseus
were
not
hellenes
and
as
for
the
ancestors
of
acrisios
who
according
to
this
account
belonged
not
to
perseus
in
any
way
by
kinship
they
say
that
these
were
as
the
hellenes
report
let
it
suffice
to
have
said
so
much
about
these
matters
and
as
to
the
question
how
and
by
what
exploits
being
egyptians
they
received
the
sceptres
of
royalty
over
the
dorians
we
will
omit
these
things
since
others
have
told
about
them
but
the
things
with
which
other
narrators
have
not
dealt
of
these
i
will
make
mention
these
are
the
royal
rights
which
have
been
given
by
the
spartans
to
their
kings
namely
two
priesthoods
of
zeus
lakedaimon
and
zeus
uranios
and
the
right
of
making
war
against
whatsoever
land
they
please
and
that
no
man
of
the
spartans
shall
hinder
this
right
or
if
he
do
he
shall
be
subject
to
the
curse
and
that
when
they
go
on
expeditions
the
kings
shall
go
out
first
and
return
last
that
a
hundred
picked
men
shall
be
their
guard
upon
expeditions
and
that
they
shall
use
in
their
goings
forth
to
war
as
many
cattle
as
they
desire
and
take
both
the
hides
and
the
backs
of
all
that
are
these
are
their
privileges
in
war
and
in
peace
moreover
things
have
been
assigned
to
them
as
follows
if
any
sacrifice
is
performed
at
the
public
charge
it
is
the
privilege
of
the
kings
to
sit
down
at
the
feast
before
all
others
and
that
the
attendants
shall
begin
with
them
first
and
serve
to
each
of
them
a
portion
of
everything
double
of
that
which
is
given
to
the
other
guests
and
that
they
shall
have
the
first
pouring
of
libations
and
the
hides
of
the
animals
slain
in
sacrifice
that
on
every
new
moon
and
seventh
day
of
the
month
there
shall
be
delivered
at
the
public
charge
to
each
one
of
these
a
victim
in
the
temple
of
apollo
and
a
measure
of
and
a
laconian
quarter
of
wine
and
that
at
all
the
games
they
shall
have
seats
of
honour
specially
set
apart
for
them
moreover
it
is
their
privilege
to
appoint
as
protectors
of
strangers
whomsoever
they
will
of
the
citizens
and
to
choose
each
two
pythians
now
the
pythians
are
men
sent
to
consult
the
god
at
delphi
and
they
eat
with
the
kings
at
the
public
charge
and
if
the
kings
do
not
come
to
the
dinner
it
is
the
rule
that
there
shall
be
sent
out
for
them
to
their
houses
two
quarts
of
for
each
one
and
half
a
pint
of
wine
but
if
they
are
present
double
shares
of
everything
shall
be
given
them
and
moreover
they
shall
be
honoured
in
this
same
manner
when
they
have
been
invited
to
dinner
by
private
persons
the
kings
also
it
is
ordained
shall
have
charge
of
the
oracles
which
are
given
but
the
pythians
also
shall
have
knowledge
of
them
it
is
the
rule
moreover
that
the
kings
alone
give
decision
on
the
following
cases
only
that
is
to
say
about
the
maiden
who
inherits
her
father
property
namely
who
ought
to
have
her
if
her
father
have
not
betrothed
her
to
any
one
and
about
public
ways
also
if
any
man
desires
to
adopt
a
son
he
must
do
it
in
presence
of
the
kings
and
it
is
ordained
that
they
shall
sit
in
council
with
the
senators
who
are
in
number
and
if
they
do
not
come
those
of
the
senators
who
are
most
closely
related
to
them
shall
have
the
privileges
of
the
kings
and
give
two
votes
besides
their
own
making
three
in
all
these
rights
have
been
assigned
to
the
kings
for
their
lifetime
by
the
spartan
state
and
after
they
are
dead
these
which
follow
horsemen
go
round
and
announce
that
which
has
happened
throughout
the
whole
of
the
laconian
land
and
in
the
city
women
go
about
and
strike
upon
a
copper
kettle
whenever
this
happens
so
two
free
persons
of
each
household
must
go
into
mourning
a
man
and
a
woman
and
for
those
who
fail
to
do
this
great
penalties
are
appointed
now
the
custom
of
the
lacedemonians
about
the
deaths
of
their
kings
is
the
same
as
that
of
the
barbarians
who
dwell
in
asia
for
most
of
the
barbarians
practise
the
same
customs
as
regards
the
death
of
their
kings
whensoever
a
king
of
the
lacedemonians
is
dead
then
from
the
whole
territory
of
lacedemon
not
reckoning
the
spartans
a
certain
fixed
number
of
the
dwellers
round
are
compelled
to
go
to
the
funeral
ceremony
and
when
there
have
been
gathered
together
of
these
and
of
the
helots
and
of
the
spartans
themselves
many
thousands
in
the
same
place
with
their
women
intermingled
they
beat
their
foreheads
with
a
good
will
and
make
lamentation
without
stint
saying
that
this
one
who
has
died
last
of
their
kings
was
the
best
of
all
and
whenever
any
of
their
kings
has
been
killed
in
war
they
prepare
an
image
to
represent
him
laid
upon
a
couch
with
fair
coverings
and
carry
it
out
to
be
buried
then
after
they
have
buried
him
no
assembly
is
held
among
them
for
ten
days
nor
is
there
any
meeting
for
choice
of
magistrates
but
they
have
mourning
during
these
days
in
another
respect
too
these
resemble
the
persians
that
is
to
say
when
the
king
is
dead
and
another
is
appointed
king
this
king
who
is
newly
coming
in
sets
free
any
man
of
the
spartans
who
was
a
debtor
to
the
king
or
to
the
state
while
among
the
persians
the
king
who
comes
to
the
throne
remits
to
all
the
cities
the
arrears
of
tribute
which
are
due
in
the
following
point
also
the
lacedemonians
resemble
the
egyptians
that
is
to
say
their
heralds
and
fluteplayers
and
cooks
inherit
the
crafts
of
their
fathers
and
a
fluteplayer
is
the
son
of
a
fluteplayer
a
cook
of
a
cook
and
a
herald
of
a
herald
other
men
do
not
lay
hands
upon
the
office
because
they
have
loud
and
clear
voices
and
so
shut
them
out
of
it
but
they
practise
their
craft
by
inheritance
from
their
fathers
thus
are
these
things
done
and
at
this
time
of
which
we
speak
while
cleomenes
was
in
egina
doing
deeds
which
were
for
the
common
service
of
hellas
demaratos
brought
charges
against
him
not
so
much
because
he
cared
for
the
eginetans
as
because
he
felt
envy
and
jealousy
of
him
then
cleomenes
after
he
returned
from
egina
planned
to
depose
demaratos
from
being
king
making
an
attempt
upon
him
on
account
of
this
matter
which
follows
ariston
being
king
in
sparta
and
having
married
two
wives
yet
had
no
children
born
to
him
and
since
he
did
not
acknowledge
that
he
himself
was
the
cause
of
this
he
married
a
third
wife
and
he
married
her
thus
he
had
a
friend
a
man
of
the
spartans
to
whom
of
all
the
citizens
ariston
was
most
inclined
and
it
chanced
that
this
man
had
a
wife
who
was
of
all
the
women
in
sparta
the
fairest
by
far
and
one
too
who
had
become
the
fairest
from
having
been
the
foulest
for
as
she
was
mean
in
her
aspect
her
nurse
considering
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
wealthy
persons
and
was
of
uncomely
aspect
and
seeing
moreover
that
her
parents
were
troubled
by
it
perceiving
i
say
these
things
her
nurse
devised
as
follows
every
day
she
bore
her
to
the
temple
of
helen
which
is
in
the
place
called
therapne
lying
above
the
temple
of
phoebus
and
whenever
the
nurse
bore
her
thither
she
placed
her
before
the
image
and
prayed
the
goddess
to
deliver
the
child
from
her
unshapeliness
and
once
as
the
nurse
was
going
away
out
of
the
temple
it
is
said
that
a
woman
appeared
to
her
and
having
appeared
asked
her
what
she
was
bearing
in
her
arms
and
she
told
her
that
she
was
bearing
a
child
upon
which
the
other
bade
her
show
the
child
to
her
but
she
refused
for
it
had
been
forbidden
to
her
by
the
parents
to
show
it
to
any
one
but
the
woman
continued
to
urge
her
by
all
means
to
show
it
to
her
so
then
perceiving
that
the
woman
earnestly
desired
to
see
it
the
nurse
showed
her
the
child
then
the
woman
stroking
the
head
of
the
child
said
that
she
should
be
the
fairest
of
all
the
women
in
sparta
and
from
that
day
her
aspect
was
changed
afterwards
when
she
came
to
the
age
for
marriage
she
was
married
to
agetos
the
son
of
alkeides
this
friend
of
ariston
of
whom
we
now
ariston
it
seems
was
ever
stung
by
the
desire
of
this
woman
and
accordingly
he
contrived
as
follows
he
made
an
engagement
himself
with
his
comrade
whose
wife
this
woman
was
that
he
would
give
him
as
a
gift
one
thing
of
his
own
possessions
whatsoever
he
should
choose
and
he
bade
his
comrade
make
return
to
him
in
similar
fashion
he
therefore
fearing
nothing
for
his
wife
because
he
saw
that
ariston
also
had
a
wife
agreed
to
this
and
on
these
terms
they
imposed
oaths
on
one
another
after
this
ariston
on
his
part
gave
that
which
agetos
had
chosen
from
the
treasures
of
ariston
whatever
the
thing
was
and
he
himself
seeking
to
obtain
from
him
the
like
return
endeavoured
then
to
take
away
the
wife
of
his
comrade
from
him
and
he
said
that
he
consented
to
give
anything
else
except
this
one
thing
only
but
at
length
being
compelled
by
the
oath
and
by
the
treacherous
deception
he
allowed
her
to
be
taken
away
from
thus
had
ariston
brought
into
his
house
the
third
wife
having
dismissed
the
second
and
this
wife
not
having
fulfilled
the
ten
months
but
in
a
shorter
period
of
time
bore
him
that
demaratos
of
whom
we
were
speaking
and
one
of
his
servants
reported
to
him
as
he
was
sitting
in
council
with
the
ephors
that
a
son
had
been
born
to
him
he
then
knowing
the
time
when
he
took
to
him
his
wife
and
reckoning
the
months
upon
his
fingers
said
denying
with
an
oath
the
child
would
not
be
mine
this
the
ephors
heard
but
they
thought
it
a
matter
of
no
importance
at
the
moment
and
the
child
grew
up
and
ariston
repented
of
that
which
he
had
said
for
he
thought
demaratos
was
certainly
his
own
son
and
he
gave
him
the
name
demaratos
for
this
reason
namely
because
before
these
things
took
place
the
spartan
people
all
in
a
body
had
made
a
vow
praying
that
a
son
might
be
born
to
ariston
as
one
who
was
in
renown
over
all
the
kings
who
had
ever
arisen
in
sparta
for
this
reason
the
name
demaratos
was
given
to
him
and
as
time
went
on
ariston
died
and
demaratos
obtained
the
kingdom
but
it
was
fated
apparently
that
these
things
should
become
known
and
should
cause
demaratos
to
be
deposed
from
the
kingdom
and
therefore
demaratos
came
to
be
at
variance
greatly
with
cleomenes
both
at
the
former
time
when
he
withdrew
his
army
from
eleusis
and
also
now
especially
when
cleomenes
had
crossed
over
to
take
those
of
the
eginetans
who
had
gone
over
to
the
cleomenes
then
being
anxious
to
take
vengeance
on
him
concerted
matters
with
leotychides
the
son
of
menares
the
son
of
agis
who
was
of
the
same
house
as
demaratos
under
condition
that
if
he
should
set
him
up
as
king
instead
of
demaratos
he
would
go
with
him
against
the
eginetans
now
leotychides
had
become
a
bitter
foe
of
demaratos
on
account
of
this
matter
which
follows
leotychides
had
betrothed
himself
to
percalos
the
daughter
of
chilon
son
of
demarmenos
and
demaratos
plotted
against
him
and
deprived
leotychides
of
his
marriage
carrying
off
percalos
himself
beforehand
and
getting
her
for
his
wife
thus
had
arisen
the
enmity
of
leotychides
against
demaratos
and
now
by
the
instigation
of
cleomenes
leotychides
deposed
against
demaratos
saying
that
he
was
not
rightfully
reigning
over
the
spartans
not
being
a
son
of
ariston
and
after
this
deposition
he
prosecuted
a
suit
against
him
recalling
the
old
saying
which
ariston
uttered
at
the
time
when
his
servant
reported
to
him
that
a
son
was
born
to
him
and
he
reckoning
up
the
months
denied
with
an
oath
saying
that
it
was
not
his
taking
his
stand
upon
this
utterance
leotychides
proceeded
to
prove
that
demaratos
was
not
born
of
ariston
nor
was
rightfully
reigning
over
sparta
and
he
produced
as
witnesses
those
ephors
who
chanced
then
to
have
been
sitting
with
ariston
in
council
and
to
have
heard
him
say
at
last
as
there
was
contention
about
those
matters
the
spartans
resolved
to
ask
the
oracle
at
delphi
whether
demaratos
was
the
son
of
ariston
the
question
then
having
been
referred
by
the
arrangement
of
cleomenes
to
the
pythian
prophetess
thereupon
cleomenes
gained
over
to
his
side
cobon
the
son
of
aristophantos
who
had
most
power
among
the
delphians
and
cobin
persuaded
perialla
the
prophetess
of
the
oracle
to
say
that
which
cleomenes
desired
to
have
said
thus
the
pythian
prophetess
when
those
who
were
sent
to
consult
the
god
asked
her
their
question
gave
decision
that
demaratos
was
not
the
son
of
ariston
afterwards
however
these
things
became
known
and
both
cobon
went
into
exile
from
delphi
and
perialla
the
prophetess
of
the
oracle
was
removed
from
her
office
with
regard
to
the
deposing
of
demaratos
from
the
kingdom
it
happened
thus
but
demaratos
became
an
exile
from
sparta
to
the
medes
on
account
of
a
reproach
which
here
follows
after
he
had
been
deposed
from
the
kingdom
demaratos
was
holding
a
public
office
to
which
he
had
been
elected
now
it
was
the
time
of
the
gymnopaidiai
and
as
demaratos
was
a
spectator
of
them
leotychides
who
had
now
become
king
himself
instead
of
demaratos
sent
his
attendant
and
asked
demaratos
in
mockery
and
insult
what
kind
of
a
thing
it
was
to
be
a
magistrate
after
having
been
king
and
he
vexed
at
the
question
made
answer
and
said
that
he
himself
had
now
had
experience
of
both
but
leotychides
had
not
this
question
however
he
said
would
be
the
beginning
either
of
countless
evil
or
countless
good
fortune
for
the
lacedemonians
having
thus
said
he
veiled
his
head
and
went
forth
out
of
the
theatre
to
his
own
house
and
forthwith
he
made
preparations
and
sacrificed
an
ox
to
zeus
and
after
having
sacrificed
he
called
his
then
when
his
mother
had
come
he
put
into
her
hands
some
of
the
inner
parts
of
the
victim
and
besought
her
saying
as
follows
mother
i
beseech
thee
appealing
to
the
other
gods
and
above
all
to
this
zeus
the
guardian
of
the
household
to
tell
me
the
truth
who
is
really
and
truly
my
father
for
leotychides
spoke
in
his
contention
with
me
saying
that
thou
didst
come
to
ariston
with
child
by
thy
former
husband
and
others
besides
reporting
that
which
is
doubtless
an
idle
tale
say
that
thou
didst
go
in
to
one
of
the
servants
namely
the
keeper
of
the
asses
and
that
i
am
his
son
i
therefore
entreat
thee
by
the
gods
to
tell
me
the
truth
for
if
thou
hast
done
any
of
these
things
which
are
reported
thou
hast
not
done
them
alone
but
with
many
other
women
and
the
report
is
commonly
believed
in
sparta
that
there
was
not
in
ariston
seed
which
should
beget
children
for
if
so
then
his
former
wives
also
would
have
borne
thus
he
spoke
and
she
made
answer
as
follows
my
son
since
thou
dost
beseech
me
with
entreaties
to
speak
the
truth
the
whole
truth
shall
be
told
to
thee
when
ariston
had
brought
me
into
his
house
on
the
third
night
there
came
to
me
an
apparition
in
the
likeness
of
ariston
and
having
lain
with
me
it
put
upon
me
the
garlands
which
it
had
on
and
the
apparition
straitway
departed
and
after
this
ariston
came
and
when
he
saw
me
with
garlands
he
asked
who
it
was
who
had
given
me
them
and
i
said
that
he
had
given
them
but
he
did
not
admit
it
and
i
began
to
take
oath
of
it
saying
that
he
did
not
well
to
deny
it
for
he
had
come
i
said
a
short
time
before
and
had
lain
with
me
and
given
me
the
garlands
then
ariston
seeing
that
i
made
oath
of
it
perceived
that
the
matter
was
of
the
gods
and
first
the
garlands
were
found
to
be
from
the
which
stands
by
the
outer
door
of
the
house
which
they
call
the
temple
of
astrabacos
and
secondly
the
diviners
gave
answer
that
it
was
this
same
hero
thus
my
son
thou
hast
all
as
much
as
thou
desirest
to
learn
for
either
thou
art
begotten
of
this
hero
and
the
hero
astrabacos
is
thy
father
or
ariston
is
thy
father
for
on
that
night
i
conceived
thee
but
as
to
that
wherein
thy
foes
most
take
hold
of
thee
saying
that
ariston
himself
when
thy
birth
was
announced
to
him
in
the
hearing
of
many
declared
that
thou
wert
not
his
son
because
the
time
the
ten
months
namely
had
not
yet
been
fulfilled
in
ignorance
of
such
matters
he
cast
forth
that
saying
for
women
bring
forth
children
both
at
the
ninth
month
and
also
at
the
seventh
and
not
all
after
they
have
completed
ten
months
and
i
bore
thee
my
son
at
the
seventh
month
and
ariston
himself
also
perceived
after
no
long
time
that
he
had
uttered
this
saying
in
folly
do
not
thou
then
accept
any
other
reports
about
thy
begetting
for
thou
hast
heard
in
all
the
full
truth
but
to
leotychides
and
to
those
who
report
these
things
may
their
wives
bear
children
by
keepers
of
asses
thus
she
spoke
and
he
having
learnt
that
which
he
desired
to
learn
took
supplies
for
travelling
and
set
forth
to
go
to
elis
pretending
that
he
was
going
to
delphi
to
consult
the
oracle
but
the
lacedemonians
suspecting
that
he
was
attempting
to
escape
pursued
after
him
and
it
chanced
that
before
they
came
demaratos
had
passed
over
to
zakynthos
from
elis
and
the
lacedemonians
crossing
over
after
him
laid
hands
on
his
person
and
carried
away
his
attendants
from
him
afterwards
however
since
those
of
zakynthos
refused
to
give
him
up
he
passed
over
from
thence
to
asia
to
the
presence
of
king
dareios
and
dareios
both
received
him
with
great
honour
as
a
guest
and
also
gave
him
land
and
cities
thus
demaratos
had
come
to
asia
and
such
was
the
fortune
which
he
had
had
having
been
distinguished
in
the
estimation
of
the
lacedemonians
in
many
other
ways
both
by
deeds
and
by
counsels
and
especially
having
gained
for
them
an
olympic
victory
with
the
chariot
being
the
only
one
who
achieved
this
of
all
the
kings
who
ever
arose
in
sparta
demaratos
being
deposed
leotychides
the
son
of
menares
succeeded
to
the
kingdom
and
he
had
born
to
him
a
son
zeuxidemos
whom
some
of
the
spartans
called
kyniscos
this
zeuxidemos
did
not
become
king
of
sparta
for
he
died
before
leotychides
leaving
a
son
archidemos
and
leotychides
having
lost
zeuxidemos
married
a
second
wife
eurydame
the
sister
of
menios
and
daughter
of
diactorides
by
whom
he
had
no
male
issue
but
a
daughter
lampito
whom
archidemos
the
son
of
zeuxidemos
took
in
marriage
she
being
given
to
him
by
leotychides
however
did
not
himself
live
to
old
age
in
sparta
but
paid
a
retribution
for
demaratos
as
follows
he
went
as
commander
of
the
lacedemonians
to
invade
thessaly
and
when
he
might
have
reduced
all
to
subjection
he
accepted
gifts
of
money
amounting
to
a
large
sum
and
being
taken
in
the
act
there
in
the
camp
as
he
was
sitting
upon
a
glove
full
of
money
he
was
brought
to
trial
and
banished
from
sparta
and
his
house
was
razed
to
the
ground
so
he
went
into
exile
to
tegea
and
ended
his
life
these
things
happened
later
but
at
this
time
when
cleomenes
had
brought
to
a
successful
issue
the
affair
which
concerned
demaratos
forthwith
he
took
with
him
leotychides
and
went
against
the
eginetans
being
very
greatly
enraged
with
them
because
of
their
insults
towards
him
so
the
eginetans
on
their
part
since
both
the
kings
had
come
against
them
thought
fit
no
longer
to
resist
and
the
spartans
selected
ten
men
who
were
the
most
considerable
among
the
eginetans
both
by
wealth
and
by
birth
and
took
them
away
as
prisoners
and
among
others
also
crios
the
son
of
polycritos
and
casambos
the
son
of
aristocrates
who
had
the
greatest
power
among
them
and
having
taken
these
away
to
the
land
of
attica
they
deposited
them
as
a
charge
with
the
athenians
who
were
the
bitterest
enemies
of
the
eginetans
after
this
cleomenes
since
it
had
become
known
that
he
had
devised
evil
against
demaratos
was
seized
by
fear
of
the
spartans
and
retired
to
thessaly
thence
he
came
to
arcadia
and
began
to
make
mischief
and
to
combine
the
arcadians
against
sparta
and
besides
other
oaths
with
which
he
caused
them
to
swear
that
they
would
assuredly
follow
him
whithersoever
he
should
lead
them
he
was
very
desirous
also
to
bring
the
chiefs
of
the
arcadians
to
the
city
of
nonacris
and
cause
them
to
swear
by
the
water
of
styx
for
near
this
city
it
is
said
by
the
arcadians
that
there
is
the
water
of
styx
and
there
is
in
fact
something
of
this
kind
a
small
stream
of
water
is
seen
to
trickle
down
from
a
rock
into
a
hollow
ravine
and
round
the
ravine
runs
a
wall
of
rough
stones
now
nonacris
where
it
happens
that
this
spring
is
situated
is
a
city
of
arcadia
near
the
lacedemonians
hearing
that
cleomenes
was
acting
thus
were
afraid
and
proceeded
to
bring
him
back
to
sparta
to
rule
on
the
same
terms
as
before
but
when
he
had
come
back
forthwith
a
disease
of
madness
seized
him
who
had
been
even
before
this
somewhat
insane
and
whenever
he
met
any
of
the
spartans
he
dashed
his
staff
against
the
man
face
and
as
he
continued
to
do
this
and
had
gone
quite
out
of
his
senses
his
kinsmen
bound
him
in
stocks
then
being
so
bound
and
seeing
his
warder
left
alone
by
the
rest
he
asked
him
for
a
knife
and
the
warder
not
being
at
first
willing
to
give
it
he
threatened
him
with
that
which
he
would
do
to
him
afterwards
if
he
did
not
until
at
last
the
warder
fearing
the
threats
for
he
was
one
of
the
helots
gave
him
a
knife
then
cleomenes
when
he
had
received
the
steel
began
to
maltreat
himself
from
the
legs
upwards
for
he
went
on
cutting
his
flesh
lengthways
from
the
legs
to
the
thighs
and
from
the
thighs
to
the
loins
and
flanks
until
at
last
he
came
to
the
belly
and
cutting
this
into
strips
he
died
in
that
manner
and
this
happened
as
most
of
the
hellenes
report
because
he
persuaded
the
pythian
prophetess
to
advise
that
which
was
done
about
demaratos
but
as
the
athenians
alone
report
it
was
because
when
he
invaded
eleusis
he
laid
waste
the
sacred
enclosure
of
the
goddesses
and
according
to
the
report
of
the
argives
because
from
their
sanctuary
dedicated
to
argos
he
caused
to
come
down
those
of
the
argives
who
had
fled
for
refuge
from
the
battle
and
slew
them
and
also
set
fire
to
the
grove
itself
holding
it
in
no
for
when
cleomenes
was
consulting
the
oracle
at
delphi
the
answer
was
given
him
that
he
should
conquer
argos
so
he
led
the
spartans
and
came
to
the
river
erasinos
which
is
said
to
flow
from
the
stymphalian
lake
for
this
lake
they
say
running
out
into
a
viewless
chasm
appears
again
above
ground
in
the
land
of
argos
and
from
thence
onwards
this
water
is
called
by
the
argives
erasinos
having
come
i
say
to
this
river
cleomenes
did
sacrifice
to
it
and
since
the
sacrifices
were
not
at
all
favourable
for
him
to
cross
over
he
said
that
he
admired
the
erasinos
for
not
betraying
the
men
of
its
country
but
the
argives
should
not
even
so
escape
after
this
he
retired
back
from
thence
and
led
his
army
down
to
thyrea
and
having
done
sacrifice
to
the
sea
by
slaying
a
bull
he
brought
them
in
ships
to
the
land
of
tiryns
and
being
informed
of
this
the
argives
came
to
the
rescue
towards
the
sea
and
when
they
had
got
near
tiryns
and
were
at
the
place
which
is
called
hesipeia
they
encamped
opposite
to
the
lacedemonians
leaving
no
very
wide
space
between
the
armies
there
the
argives
were
not
afraid
of
the
open
fighting
but
only
lest
they
should
be
conquered
by
craft
for
to
this
they
thought
referred
the
oracle
which
the
pythian
prophetess
gave
in
common
to
these
and
to
the
milesians
saying
as
follows
but
when
the
female
at
length
shall
conquer
the
male
in
the
battle
conquer
and
drive
him
forth
and
glory
shall
gain
among
argives
then
many
wives
of
the
argives
shall
tear
both
cheeks
in
their
mourning
so
that
a
man
shall
say
some
time
of
the
men
that
came
after
by
the
spear
it
perished
the
terrible
serpent
the
conjunction
of
all
these
things
caused
fear
to
the
argives
and
with
a
view
to
this
they
resolved
to
make
use
of
the
enemy
herald
and
having
so
resolved
they
proceeded
to
do
as
follows
whenever
the
spartan
herald
proclaimed
anything
to
the
lacedemonians
the
argives
also
did
that
same
so
cleomenes
perceiving
that
the
argives
were
doing
whatever
the
herald
of
the
lacedemonians
proclaimed
passed
the
word
to
the
lacedemonians
that
when
the
herald
should
proclaim
that
they
were
to
get
breakfast
then
they
should
take
up
their
arms
and
go
to
attack
the
argives
this
was
carried
out
even
so
by
the
lacedemonians
for
as
the
argives
were
getting
breakfast
according
to
the
herald
proclamation
they
attacked
them
and
many
of
them
they
slew
but
many
more
yet
took
refuge
in
the
sacred
grove
of
argos
and
upon
these
they
kept
watch
sitting
round
about
the
place
then
cleomenes
did
this
which
follows
he
had
with
him
deserters
and
getting
information
by
inquiring
of
these
he
sent
a
herald
and
summoned
forth
those
of
the
argives
who
were
shut
up
in
the
sanctuary
mentioning
each
by
name
and
he
summoned
them
forth
saying
that
he
had
received
their
ransom
now
among
the
peloponnesians
ransom
is
two
pounds
weight
of
silver
appointed
to
be
paid
for
each
prisoner
so
cleomenes
summoned
forth
about
fifty
of
the
argives
one
by
one
and
slew
them
and
it
chanced
that
the
rest
who
were
in
the
enclosure
did
not
perceive
that
this
was
being
done
for
since
the
grove
was
thick
those
within
did
not
see
how
it
fared
with
those
who
were
without
at
least
until
one
of
them
climbed
up
a
tree
and
saw
from
above
that
which
was
being
done
accordingly
they
then
no
longer
came
forth
when
they
were
called
so
cleomenes
thereupon
ordered
all
the
helots
to
pile
up
brushwood
round
the
sacred
grove
and
they
obeying
he
set
fire
to
the
grove
and
when
it
was
now
burning
he
asked
one
of
the
deserters
to
what
god
the
grove
was
sacred
and
the
man
replied
that
it
was
sacred
to
argos
when
he
heard
that
he
groaned
aloud
and
said
apollo
who
utterest
oracles
surely
thou
hast
greatly
deceived
me
saying
that
i
should
conquer
argos
i
conjecture
that
the
oracle
has
had
its
fulfilment
for
me
after
this
cleomenes
sent
away
the
greater
part
of
his
army
to
go
back
to
sparta
but
he
himself
took
a
thousand
of
the
best
men
and
went
to
the
temple
of
hera
to
sacrifice
and
when
he
wished
to
sacrifice
upon
the
altar
the
priest
forbade
him
saying
that
it
was
not
permitted
by
religious
rule
for
a
stranger
to
sacrifice
in
that
place
cleomenes
however
bade
the
helots
take
away
the
priest
from
the
altar
and
scourge
him
and
he
himself
offered
the
sacrifice
having
so
done
he
returned
back
to
sparta
and
after
his
return
his
opponents
brought
him
up
before
the
ephors
saying
that
he
had
received
gifts
and
therefore
had
not
conquered
argos
when
he
might
easily
have
conquered
it
he
said
to
them
but
whether
he
was
speaking
falsely
or
whether
truly
i
am
not
able
with
certainty
to
say
however
that
may
be
he
spoke
and
said
that
when
he
had
conquered
the
sanctuary
of
argos
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
oracle
of
the
god
had
had
its
fulfilment
for
him
therefore
he
did
not
think
it
right
to
make
an
attempt
on
the
city
at
least
until
he
should
have
had
recourse
to
sacrifice
and
should
have
learnt
whether
the
deity
permitted
him
or
whether
she
stood
opposed
to
him
and
as
he
was
sacrificing
for
augury
in
the
temple
of
hera
a
flame
of
fire
blazed
forth
from
the
breasts
of
the
image
and
thus
he
knew
the
certainty
of
the
matter
namely
that
he
would
not
conquer
argos
for
if
fire
had
blazed
forth
from
the
head
of
the
image
he
would
have
been
conqueror
of
the
city
from
top
to
bottom
but
since
it
blazed
from
the
breasts
everything
had
been
accomplished
for
him
which
the
god
desired
should
come
to
pass
thus
speaking
he
seemed
to
the
spartans
to
speak
credibly
and
reasonably
and
he
easily
escaped
his
pursuers
argos
however
was
so
bereft
of
men
that
their
slaves
took
possession
of
all
the
state
ruling
and
managing
it
until
the
sons
of
those
who
had
perished
grew
to
be
men
then
these
endeavouring
to
gain
argos
back
to
themselves
cast
them
out
and
the
slaves
being
driven
forth
gained
possession
of
tiryns
by
fighting
now
for
a
time
these
two
parties
had
friendly
relations
with
one
another
but
afterwards
there
came
to
the
slaves
a
prophet
named
cleander
by
race
a
phigalian
from
arcadia
this
man
persuaded
the
slaves
to
attack
their
masters
and
in
consequence
of
this
there
was
war
between
them
for
a
long
time
until
at
last
with
difficulty
the
argives
overcame
them
the
argives
then
say
that
this
was
the
reason
why
cleomenes
went
mad
and
had
an
evil
end
but
the
spartans
themselves
say
that
cleomenes
was
not
driven
mad
by
any
divine
power
but
that
he
had
become
a
drinker
of
unmixed
wine
from
having
associated
with
scythians
and
that
he
went
mad
in
consequence
of
this
for
the
nomad
scythians
they
say
when
dareios
had
made
invasion
of
their
land
desired
eagerly
after
this
to
take
vengeance
upon
him
and
they
sent
to
sparta
and
tried
to
make
an
alliance
and
to
arrange
that
while
the
scythians
themselves
attempted
an
invasion
of
media
by
the
way
of
the
river
phasis
the
spartans
should
set
forth
from
ephesos
and
go
up
inland
and
then
that
they
should
meet
in
one
place
and
they
say
that
cleomenes
when
the
scythians
had
come
for
this
purpose
associated
with
them
largely
and
that
thus
associating
more
than
was
fit
he
learnt
the
practice
of
drinking
wine
unmixed
with
water
and
for
this
cause
as
the
spartans
think
he
went
mad
thenceforth
as
they
say
themselves
when
they
desire
to
drink
stronger
wine
they
say
fill
up
in
scythian
fashion
thus
the
spartans
report
about
cleomenes
but
to
me
it
seems
that
this
was
a
retribution
which
cleomenes
paid
for
demaratos
now
when
the
eginetans
heard
that
cleomenes
had
met
his
end
they
sent
messengers
to
sparta
to
denounce
leotychides
for
the
matter
of
the
hostages
which
were
being
kept
at
athens
and
the
lacedemonians
caused
a
court
to
assemble
and
judged
that
the
eginetans
had
been
dealt
with
outrageously
by
leotychides
and
they
condemned
him
to
be
taken
to
egina
and
delivered
up
in
place
of
the
men
who
were
being
kept
at
athens
then
when
the
eginetans
were
about
to
take
leotychides
theasides
the
son
of
leoprepes
a
man
of
repute
in
sparta
said
to
them
what
are
ye
proposing
to
do
men
of
egina
do
ye
mean
to
take
away
the
king
of
the
spartans
thus
delivered
up
to
you
by
his
if
the
spartans
now
being
in
anger
have
decided
so
beware
lest
at
some
future
time
if
ye
do
this
they
bring
an
evil
upon
your
land
which
may
destroy
it
hearing
this
the
eginetans
abstained
from
taking
him
but
they
came
to
an
agreement
that
leotychides
should
accompany
them
to
athens
and
restore
the
men
to
the
eginetans
when
however
leotychides
came
to
athens
and
asked
for
the
deposit
back
the
athenians
not
being
willing
to
give
up
the
hostages
produced
pretexts
for
refusing
and
alleged
that
two
kings
had
deposited
them
and
they
did
not
think
it
right
to
give
them
back
to
the
one
without
the
other
so
since
the
athenians
said
that
they
would
not
give
them
back
leotychides
spoke
to
them
as
follows
a
athenians
do
whichever
thing
ye
yourselves
desire
for
ye
know
that
if
ye
give
them
up
ye
do
that
which
religion
commands
and
if
ye
refuse
to
give
them
up
ye
do
the
opposite
of
this
but
i
desire
to
tell
you
what
kind
of
a
thing
came
to
pass
once
in
sparta
about
a
deposit
we
spartans
report
that
there
was
in
lacedemon
about
two
generations
before
my
time
on
glaucos
the
son
of
epikydes
this
man
we
say
attained
the
highest
merit
in
all
things
besides
and
especially
he
was
well
reported
of
by
all
who
at
that
time
dwelt
in
lacedemon
for
his
uprightness
and
we
relate
that
in
due
time
it
happened
to
him
thus
a
man
of
miletos
came
to
sparta
and
desired
to
have
speech
with
him
alleging
the
reasons
which
follow
am
a
milesian
he
said
i
am
come
hither
desiring
to
have
benefit
from
thy
uprightness
glaucos
for
as
there
was
much
report
of
thy
uprightness
throughout
all
the
rest
of
hellas
and
also
in
ionia
i
considered
with
myself
that
ionia
is
ever
in
danger
whereas
peloponnesus
is
safely
established
and
also
that
we
never
see
wealth
continue
in
the
possession
of
the
same
persons
long
reflecting
i
say
on
these
things
and
taking
counsel
with
myself
i
resolved
to
turn
into
money
the
half
of
my
possessions
and
to
place
it
with
thee
being
well
assured
that
if
it
were
placed
with
thee
i
should
have
it
safe
do
thou
therefore
i
pray
thee
receive
the
money
and
take
and
keep
these
tallies
and
whosoever
shall
ask
for
the
money
back
having
the
tokens
answering
to
these
to
him
do
thou
restore
it
b
the
stranger
who
had
come
from
miletos
said
so
much
and
glaucos
accepted
the
deposit
on
the
terms
proposed
then
after
a
long
time
had
gone
by
there
came
to
sparta
the
sons
of
him
who
had
deposited
the
money
with
glaucos
and
they
came
to
speech
with
glaucos
and
producing
the
tokens
asked
for
the
money
to
be
given
back
but
he
repulsed
them
answering
them
again
thus
do
not
remember
the
matter
nor
does
my
mind
bring
back
to
me
any
knowledge
of
those
things
whereof
ye
speak
but
i
desire
to
recollect
and
do
all
that
is
just
for
if
i
received
it
i
desire
to
restore
it
honestly
and
if
on
the
other
hand
i
did
not
receive
it
at
all
i
will
act
towards
you
in
accordance
with
the
customs
of
the
hellenes
therefore
i
defer
the
settling
of
the
matter
with
you
for
three
months
from
now
c
the
milesians
accordingly
went
away
grieved
for
they
supposed
that
they
had
been
robbed
of
the
money
but
glaucos
set
forth
to
delphi
to
consult
the
oracle
and
when
he
inquired
of
the
oracle
whether
he
should
rob
them
of
the
money
by
an
oath
the
pythian
prophetess
rebuked
him
with
these
lines
thou
epikydes
son
yea
this
for
the
moment
this
to
conquer
their
word
by
an
oath
and
to
rob
is
more
gainful
swear
since
the
lot
of
death
waits
also
for
him
who
swears
truly
but
know
thou
that
oath
has
a
son
one
nameless
and
handless
and
footless
yet
without
feet
he
pursues
without
hands
he
seizes
and
wholly
he
shall
destroy
the
race
and
the
house
of
the
man
who
offendeth
but
for
the
man
who
swears
truly
his
race
is
the
better
hereafter
having
heard
this
glaucos
entreated
that
the
god
would
pardon
him
for
that
which
he
had
said
but
the
prophetess
said
that
to
make
trial
of
the
god
and
to
do
the
deed
were
things
equivalent
d
glaucos
then
having
sent
for
the
milesians
gave
back
to
them
the
money
but
the
reason
for
which
o
athenians
i
set
forth
to
relate
to
you
this
story
shall
now
be
told
at
the
present
time
there
is
no
descendant
of
glaucos
existing
nor
any
hearth
which
is
esteemed
to
be
that
of
glaucos
but
he
has
been
utterly
destroyed
and
rooted
up
out
of
sparta
thus
it
is
good
not
even
to
entertain
a
thought
about
a
deposit
other
than
that
of
restoring
it
when
they
who
made
it
ask
for
it
again
when
leotychides
had
thus
spoken
since
not
even
so
were
the
athenians
willing
to
listen
to
him
he
departed
back
and
the
eginetans
before
paying
the
penalty
for
their
former
wrongs
wherein
they
did
outrage
to
the
athenians
to
please
the
thebans
acted
as
follows
complaining
of
the
conduct
of
the
athenians
and
thinking
that
they
were
being
wronged
they
made
preparations
to
avenge
themselves
upon
the
athenians
and
since
the
athenians
were
celebrating
a
festival
at
sunion
they
lay
in
wait
for
the
sacred
ship
which
was
sent
to
it
and
took
it
the
vessel
being
full
of
men
who
were
the
first
among
the
athenians
and
having
taken
it
they
laid
the
men
in
the
athenians
after
they
had
suffered
this
wrong
from
the
eginetans
no
longer
delayed
to
contrive
all
things
possible
to
their
hurt
and
there
was
in
egina
a
man
of
repute
one
nicodromos
the
son
of
cnithos
this
man
had
cause
of
complaint
against
the
eginetans
for
having
before
this
driven
him
forth
out
of
the
island
and
hearing
now
that
the
athenians
had
resolved
to
do
mischief
to
the
eginetans
he
agreed
with
the
athenians
to
deliver
up
egina
to
them
telling
them
on
what
day
he
would
make
his
attempt
and
by
what
day
it
would
be
necessary
for
them
to
come
to
his
after
this
nicodromos
according
as
he
had
agreed
with
the
athenians
seized
that
which
is
called
the
old
city
but
the
athenians
did
not
come
to
his
support
at
the
proper
time
for
as
it
chanced
they
had
not
ships
sufficient
to
fight
with
the
eginetans
so
while
they
were
asking
the
corinthians
to
lend
them
ships
during
this
time
their
cause
went
to
ruin
the
corinthians
however
being
at
this
time
exceedingly
friendly
with
them
gave
the
athenians
twenty
ships
at
their
request
and
these
they
gave
by
selling
them
at
five
drachmas
apiece
for
by
the
law
it
was
not
permitted
to
give
them
as
a
free
gift
having
taken
these
ships
of
which
i
speak
and
also
their
own
the
athenians
with
seventy
ships
manned
in
all
sailed
to
egina
and
they
were
later
by
one
day
than
the
time
nicodromos
meanwhile
as
the
athenians
did
not
come
to
his
support
at
the
proper
time
embarked
in
a
ship
and
escaped
from
egina
and
with
him
also
went
others
of
the
eginetans
and
the
athenians
gave
them
sunion
to
dwell
in
starting
from
whence
these
men
continued
to
plunder
the
eginetans
who
were
in
the
this
happened
afterwards
but
at
the
time
of
which
we
speak
the
class
among
the
eginetans
prevailed
over
the
men
of
the
people
who
had
risen
against
them
in
combination
with
nicodromos
and
then
having
got
them
into
their
power
they
were
bringing
their
prisoners
forth
to
execution
from
this
there
came
upon
them
a
curse
which
they
were
not
able
to
expiate
by
sacrifice
though
they
devised
against
it
all
they
could
but
they
were
driven
forth
from
the
island
before
the
goddess
became
propitious
to
them
for
they
had
taken
as
prisoners
seven
hundred
of
the
men
of
the
people
and
were
bringing
them
forth
to
execution
when
one
of
them
escaped
from
his
bonds
and
fled
for
refuge
to
the
entrance
of
the
temple
of
demeter
the
giver
of
laws
and
he
took
hold
of
the
latch
of
the
door
and
clung
to
it
and
when
they
found
that
they
could
not
drag
him
from
it
by
pulling
him
away
they
cut
off
his
hands
and
so
carried
him
off
and
those
hands
remained
clinging
to
the
latch
of
the
thus
did
the
eginetans
to
one
another
and
when
the
athenians
came
they
fought
against
them
with
seventy
ships
and
being
worsted
in
the
they
called
to
their
assistance
the
same
whom
they
had
summoned
before
namely
the
argives
these
would
no
longer
come
to
their
help
having
cause
of
complaint
because
the
ships
of
egina
compelled
by
cleomenes
had
put
in
to
the
land
of
argos
and
their
crews
had
landed
with
the
lacedemonians
with
whom
also
had
landed
men
from
ships
of
sikyon
in
this
same
invasion
and
as
a
penalty
for
this
there
was
laid
upon
them
by
the
argives
a
fine
of
a
thousand
talents
five
hundred
for
each
state
the
sikyonians
accordingly
acknowledging
that
they
had
committed
a
wrong
had
made
an
agreement
to
pay
a
hundred
talents
and
be
free
from
the
penalty
the
eginetans
however
did
not
acknowledge
their
wrong
but
were
more
stubborn
for
this
reason
then
when
they
made
request
none
of
the
argives
now
came
to
their
help
at
the
charge
of
the
state
but
volunteers
came
to
the
number
of
a
thousand
and
their
leader
was
a
commander
named
eurybates
a
man
who
had
practised
the
five
contests
of
these
men
the
greater
number
never
returned
back
but
were
slain
by
the
athenians
in
egina
and
the
commander
himself
eurybates
fighting
in
single
combat
killed
in
this
manner
three
men
and
was
himself
slain
by
the
fourth
sophanes
namely
of
dekeleia
the
eginetans
however
engaged
in
contest
with
the
athenians
in
ships
when
these
were
in
disorder
and
defeated
them
and
they
took
of
them
four
ships
together
with
their
crews
so
the
athenians
were
at
war
with
the
eginetans
and
meanwhile
the
persian
was
carrying
forward
his
design
since
he
was
put
in
mind
ever
by
his
servant
to
remember
the
athenians
and
also
because
of
the
sons
of
peisistratos
were
near
at
hand
and
brought
charges
continually
against
the
athenians
while
at
the
same
time
dareios
himself
wished
to
take
hold
of
this
pretext
and
subdue
those
nations
of
hellas
which
had
not
given
him
earth
and
water
mardonios
then
since
he
had
fared
miserably
in
his
expedition
he
removed
from
his
command
and
appointing
other
generals
to
command
he
despatched
them
against
eretria
and
athens
namely
datis
who
was
a
mede
by
race
and
artaphrenes
the
son
of
artaphrenes
a
nephew
of
the
king
and
he
sent
them
forth
with
the
charge
to
reduce
athens
and
eretria
to
slavery
and
to
bring
the
slaves
back
into
his
when
these
who
had
been
appointed
to
command
came
in
their
march
from
the
king
to
the
aleïan
plain
in
kilikia
taking
with
them
a
large
and
then
while
they
were
encamping
there
the
whole
naval
armament
came
up
which
had
been
appointed
for
several
nations
to
furnish
and
there
came
to
them
also
the
ships
for
carrying
horses
which
in
the
year
before
dareios
had
ordered
his
tributaries
to
make
ready
in
these
they
placed
their
horses
and
having
embarked
the
in
the
ships
they
sailed
for
ionia
with
six
hundred
triremes
after
this
they
did
not
keep
their
ships
coasting
along
the
mainland
towards
the
hellespont
and
thrace
but
they
started
from
samos
and
made
their
voyage
by
the
icarian
sea
and
between
the
islands
because
as
i
think
they
feared
more
than
all
else
the
voyage
round
athos
seeing
that
in
the
former
year
while
making
the
passage
by
this
way
they
had
come
to
great
disaster
moreover
also
naxos
compelled
them
since
it
had
not
been
conquered
at
the
former
time
and
when
they
had
arrived
at
naxos
coming
against
it
from
the
icarian
sea
for
it
was
against
naxos
first
that
the
persians
intended
to
make
expedition
remembering
the
former
events
the
naxians
departed
forthwith
fleeing
to
the
mountains
and
did
not
await
their
attack
but
the
persians
made
slaves
of
those
of
them
whom
they
caught
and
set
fire
to
both
the
temples
and
the
town
having
so
done
they
put
out
to
sea
to
attack
the
other
islands
while
these
were
doing
thus
the
delians
also
had
left
delos
and
fled
away
to
tenos
and
when
the
armament
was
sailing
in
thither
datis
sailed
on
before
and
did
not
allow
the
ships
to
anchor
at
the
island
of
delos
but
at
rhenaia
on
the
other
side
of
the
channel
and
he
himself
having
found
out
by
inquiry
where
the
men
of
delos
were
sent
a
herald
and
addressed
them
thus
holy
men
why
are
ye
fled
away
and
departed
having
judged
of
me
that
which
is
not
convenient
for
even
i
of
myself
have
wisdom
at
least
so
far
and
moreover
it
has
been
thus
commanded
me
by
the
king
not
to
harm
at
all
that
land
in
which
the
two
divinities
were
born
neither
the
land
itself
nor
the
inhabitants
of
it
now
therefore
return
to
your
own
possessions
and
dwell
in
your
island
thus
he
proclaimed
by
a
herald
to
the
delians
and
after
this
he
piled
up
and
burned
upon
the
altar
three
hundred
talents
weight
of
frankincense
datis
having
done
these
things
sailed
away
with
his
army
to
fight
against
eretria
first
taking
with
him
both
ionians
and
aiolians
and
after
he
had
put
out
to
sea
from
thence
delos
was
moved
not
having
been
shaken
as
the
delians
reported
to
me
either
before
that
time
or
since
that
down
to
my
own
time
and
this
no
doubt
the
god
manifested
as
a
portent
to
men
of
the
evils
that
were
about
to
be
for
in
the
time
of
dareios
the
son
of
hystaspes
and
xerxes
the
son
of
dareios
and
artoxerxes
the
son
of
xerxes
three
generations
following
upon
one
another
there
happened
more
evils
to
hellas
than
during
the
twenty
other
generations
which
came
before
dareios
some
of
the
evils
coming
to
it
from
the
persians
and
others
from
the
leaders
themselves
of
hellas
warring
together
for
supremacy
thus
it
was
not
unreasonable
that
delos
should
be
moved
which
was
before
unmoved
and
in
an
oracle
it
was
thus
written
about
it
delos
too
will
i
move
unmoved
though
it
hath
been
aforetime
now
in
the
hellenic
tongue
the
names
which
have
been
mentioned
have
this
meaning
dareios
means
compeller
xerxes
warrior
artoxerxes
great
warrior
thus
then
might
the
hellenes
rightly
call
these
kings
in
their
own
tongue
the
barbarians
then
when
they
had
departed
from
delos
touched
at
the
islands
as
they
went
and
from
them
received
additional
forces
and
took
sons
of
the
islanders
as
hostages
and
when
in
sailing
round
about
the
islands
they
put
in
also
to
carystos
seeing
that
the
carystians
would
neither
give
them
hostages
nor
consent
to
join
in
an
expedition
against
cities
that
were
their
neighbours
meaning
eretria
and
athens
they
began
to
besiege
them
and
to
ravage
their
land
until
at
last
the
carystians
also
came
over
to
the
will
of
the
the
eretrians
meanwhile
being
informed
that
the
armament
of
the
persians
was
sailing
to
attack
them
requested
the
athenians
to
help
them
and
the
athenians
did
not
refuse
their
support
but
gave
as
helpers
those
four
thousand
to
whom
had
been
allotted
the
land
of
the
wealthy
chalkidians
the
eretrians
however
as
it
turned
out
had
no
sound
plan
of
action
for
while
they
sent
for
the
athenians
they
had
in
their
minds
two
different
designs
some
of
them
that
is
proposed
to
leave
the
city
and
go
to
the
heights
of
euboea
while
others
of
them
expecting
to
win
gain
for
themselves
from
the
persian
were
preparing
to
surrender
the
place
having
got
knowledge
of
how
things
were
as
regards
both
these
plans
aischines
the
son
of
nothon
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
eretrians
told
the
whole
condition
of
their
affairs
to
those
of
the
athenians
who
had
come
and
entreated
them
to
depart
and
go
to
their
own
land
that
they
might
not
also
perish
so
the
athenians
did
according
to
this
counsel
given
to
them
by
and
while
these
passed
over
to
oropos
and
saved
themselves
the
persians
sailed
on
and
brought
their
ships
to
land
about
temenos
and
chioreai
and
aigilea
in
the
eretrian
territory
and
having
taken
possession
of
these
places
forthwith
they
began
to
disembark
their
horses
and
prepared
to
advance
against
the
enemy
the
eretrians
however
did
not
intend
to
come
forth
against
them
and
fight
but
their
endeavour
was
if
possible
to
hold
out
by
defending
their
walls
since
the
counsel
prevailed
not
to
leave
the
city
then
a
violent
assault
was
made
upon
the
wall
and
for
six
days
there
fell
many
on
both
sides
but
on
the
seventh
day
euphorbos
the
son
of
alkimachos
and
philagros
the
son
of
kyneos
men
of
repute
among
the
citizens
gave
up
the
city
to
the
persians
these
having
entered
the
city
plundered
and
set
fire
to
the
temples
in
retribution
for
the
temples
which
were
burned
at
sardis
and
also
reduced
the
people
to
slavery
according
to
the
commands
of
dareios
having
got
eretria
into
their
power
they
stayed
a
few
days
and
then
sailed
for
the
land
of
attica
pressing
on
hard
and
supposing
that
the
athenians
would
do
the
same
as
the
eretrians
had
done
and
since
marathon
was
the
most
convenient
place
in
attica
for
horsemen
to
act
and
was
also
very
near
to
eretria
therefore
hippias
the
son
of
peisistratos
was
guiding
them
when
the
athenians
had
information
of
this
they
too
went
to
marathon
to
the
rescue
of
their
land
and
they
were
led
by
ten
generals
of
whom
the
tenth
was
miltiades
whose
father
kimon
of
stesagoras
had
been
compelled
to
go
into
exile
from
athens
because
of
peisistratos
the
son
of
hippocrates
and
while
he
was
in
exile
it
was
his
fortune
to
win
a
victory
at
the
olympic
games
with
a
chariot
wherein
as
it
happened
he
did
the
same
thing
as
his
miltiades
had
done
who
had
the
same
mother
as
he
then
afterwards
in
the
next
succeeding
olympic
games
he
gained
a
victory
with
the
same
mares
and
allowed
peisistratos
to
be
proclaimed
as
victor
and
having
resigned
to
him
the
victory
he
returned
to
his
own
native
land
under
an
agreement
for
peace
then
after
he
had
won
with
the
same
mares
at
another
olympic
festival
it
was
his
hap
to
be
slain
by
the
sons
of
peisistratos
peisistratos
himself
being
no
longer
alive
these
killed
him
near
the
city
hall
having
set
men
to
lie
in
wait
for
him
by
night
and
the
of
kimon
is
in
the
outskirts
of
the
city
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
which
is
called
the
way
through
coile
and
just
opposite
him
those
mares
are
buried
which
won
in
three
olympic
games
this
same
thing
was
done
also
by
the
mares
belonging
to
euagoras
the
laconian
but
besides
these
by
none
others
now
the
elder
of
the
sons
of
kimon
stesagoras
was
at
that
time
being
brought
up
in
the
house
of
his
father
brother
miltiades
in
the
chersonese
while
the
younger
son
was
being
brought
up
at
athens
with
kimon
himself
having
been
named
miltiades
after
miltiades
the
settler
of
the
this
miltiades
then
at
the
time
of
which
we
speak
had
come
from
the
chersonese
and
was
a
general
of
the
athenians
after
escaping
death
in
two
forms
for
not
only
did
the
phenicians
who
had
pursued
after
him
as
far
as
imbros
endeavour
earnestly
to
take
him
and
bring
him
up
to
the
presence
of
the
king
but
also
after
this
when
he
had
escaped
from
these
and
had
come
to
his
own
native
land
and
seemed
to
be
in
safety
from
that
time
forth
his
opponents
who
had
laid
wait
for
him
there
brought
him
up
before
a
court
and
prosecuted
him
for
his
despotism
in
the
chersonese
having
escaped
these
also
he
had
then
been
appointed
a
general
of
the
athenians
being
elected
by
the
people
first
of
all
while
they
were
still
in
the
city
the
generals
sent
off
to
sparta
a
herald
namely
pheidippides
an
athenian
and
for
the
rest
a
runner
of
long
and
one
who
practised
this
as
his
profession
with
this
man
as
pheidippides
himself
said
and
as
he
made
report
to
the
athenians
pan
chanced
to
meet
by
mount
parthenion
which
is
above
tegea
and
calling
aloud
the
name
of
pheidippides
pan
bade
him
report
to
the
athenians
and
ask
for
what
reason
they
had
no
care
of
him
though
he
was
well
disposed
to
the
athenians
and
had
been
serviceable
to
them
on
many
occasions
before
that
time
and
would
be
so
also
yet
again
believing
that
this
tale
was
true
the
athenians
when
their
affairs
had
been
now
prosperously
settled
established
under
the
acropolis
a
temple
of
pan
and
in
consequence
of
this
message
they
propitiate
him
with
sacrifice
offered
every
year
and
with
a
however
at
that
time
the
time
namely
when
he
said
that
pan
appeared
to
him
this
pheidippides
having
been
sent
by
the
generals
was
in
sparta
on
the
next
day
after
that
on
which
he
left
the
city
of
the
athenians
and
when
he
had
come
to
the
magistrates
he
said
lacedemonians
the
athenians
make
request
of
you
to
come
to
their
help
and
not
to
allow
a
city
most
anciently
established
among
the
hellenes
to
fall
into
slavery
by
the
means
of
barbarians
for
even
now
eretria
has
been
enslaved
and
hellas
has
become
the
weaker
by
a
city
of
renown
he
as
i
say
reported
to
them
that
with
which
he
had
been
charged
and
it
pleased
them
well
to
come
to
help
the
athenians
but
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
do
so
at
once
since
they
did
not
desire
to
break
their
law
for
it
was
the
ninth
day
of
the
month
and
on
the
ninth
day
they
said
they
would
not
go
forth
nor
until
the
circle
of
the
moon
should
be
full
these
men
were
waiting
for
the
full
moon
and
meanwhile
hippias
the
son
of
peisistratos
was
guiding
the
barbarians
in
to
marathon
after
having
seen
on
the
night
that
was
just
past
a
vision
in
his
sleep
of
this
kind
it
seemed
to
hippias
that
he
lay
with
his
own
mother
he
conjectured
then
from
the
dream
that
he
should
return
to
athens
and
recover
his
rule
and
then
bring
his
life
to
an
end
in
old
age
in
his
own
land
from
the
dream
i
say
he
conjectured
this
and
after
this
as
he
guided
them
in
first
he
disembarked
the
slaves
from
eretria
on
the
island
belonging
to
the
styrians
called
aigleia
and
then
as
the
ships
came
in
to
shore
at
marathon
he
moored
them
there
and
after
the
barbarians
had
come
from
their
ships
to
land
he
was
engaged
in
disposing
them
in
their
places
while
he
was
ordering
these
things
it
came
upon
him
to
sneeze
and
cough
more
violently
than
was
his
wont
then
since
he
was
advanced
in
years
most
of
his
teeth
were
shaken
thereby
and
one
of
these
teeth
he
cast
forth
by
the
violence
of
the
cough
and
the
tooth
having
fallen
from
him
upon
the
sand
he
was
very
desirous
to
find
it
since
however
the
tooth
was
not
to
be
found
when
he
searched
he
groaned
aloud
and
said
to
those
who
were
by
him
this
land
is
not
ours
nor
shall
we
be
able
to
make
it
subject
to
us
but
so
much
part
in
it
as
belonged
to
me
the
tooth
possesses
hippias
then
conjectured
that
his
vision
had
been
thus
fulfilled
and
meanwhile
after
the
athenians
had
been
drawn
up
in
the
sacred
enclosure
of
heracles
there
joined
them
the
plataians
coming
to
their
help
in
a
body
for
the
plataians
had
given
themselves
to
the
athenians
and
the
athenians
before
this
time
undertook
many
toils
on
behalf
of
them
and
this
was
the
manner
in
which
they
gave
themselves
being
oppressed
by
the
thebans
the
plataians
at
first
desired
to
give
themselves
to
cleomenes
the
son
of
anaxandrides
and
to
the
lacedemonians
who
chanced
to
come
thither
but
these
did
not
accept
them
and
said
to
them
as
follows
we
dwell
too
far
off
and
such
support
as
ours
would
be
to
you
but
cold
comfort
for
ye
might
many
times
be
reduced
to
slavery
before
any
of
us
had
information
of
it
but
we
counsel
you
rather
to
give
yourselves
to
the
athenians
who
are
both
neighbours
and
also
not
bad
helpers
thus
the
lacedemonians
counselled
not
so
much
on
account
of
their
goodwill
to
the
plataians
as
because
they
desired
that
the
athenians
should
have
trouble
by
being
involved
in
a
conflict
with
the
boetians
the
lacedemonians
i
say
thus
counselled
the
men
of
plataia
and
they
did
not
fail
to
follow
their
counsel
but
when
the
athenians
were
doing
sacrifice
to
the
twelve
gods
they
sat
down
as
suppliants
at
the
altar
and
so
gave
themselves
then
the
thebans
having
been
informed
of
these
things
marched
against
the
plataians
and
the
athenians
came
to
their
assistance
and
as
they
were
about
to
join
battle
the
corinthians
did
not
permit
them
to
do
so
but
being
by
chance
there
they
reconciled
their
strife
and
both
parties
having
put
the
matter
into
their
hands
they
laid
down
boundaries
for
the
land
with
the
condition
that
the
thebans
should
leave
those
of
the
boeotians
alone
who
did
not
desire
to
be
reckoned
with
the
other
boeotians
the
corinthians
having
given
this
decision
departed
but
as
the
athenians
were
going
back
the
boeotians
attacked
them
and
having
attacked
them
they
were
worsted
in
the
fight
upon
that
the
athenians
passed
beyond
the
boundaries
which
the
corinthians
had
set
to
be
for
the
plataians
and
they
made
the
river
asopos
itself
to
be
the
boundary
of
the
thebans
towards
the
land
of
plataia
and
towards
the
district
of
hysiai
the
plataians
then
had
given
themselves
to
the
athenians
in
the
manner
which
has
been
said
and
at
this
time
they
came
to
marathon
to
bring
them
help
now
the
opinions
of
the
generals
of
the
athenians
were
divided
and
the
one
party
urged
that
they
should
not
fight
a
battle
seeing
that
they
were
too
few
to
fight
with
the
army
of
the
medes
while
the
others
and
among
them
miltiades
advised
that
they
should
do
so
and
when
they
were
divided
and
the
worse
opinion
was
like
to
prevail
then
since
he
who
had
been
chosen
by
lot
to
be
polemarch
of
the
athenians
had
a
vote
in
addition
to
the
ten
for
in
old
times
the
athenians
gave
the
polemarch
an
equal
vote
with
the
generals
and
at
that
time
the
polemarch
was
callimachos
of
the
deme
of
aphidnai
to
him
came
miltiades
and
said
as
follows
with
thee
now
it
rests
callimachos
either
to
bring
athens
under
slavery
or
by
making
her
free
to
leave
behind
thee
for
all
the
time
that
men
shall
live
a
memorial
such
as
not
even
harmodios
and
aristogeiton
have
left
for
now
the
athenians
have
come
to
a
danger
the
greatest
to
which
they
have
ever
come
since
they
were
a
people
and
on
the
one
hand
if
they
submit
to
the
medes
it
is
determined
what
they
shall
suffer
being
delivered
over
to
hippias
while
on
the
other
hand
if
this
city
shall
gain
the
victory
it
may
become
the
first
of
the
cities
of
hellas
how
this
may
happen
and
how
it
comes
to
thee
of
all
men
to
have
the
decision
of
these
matters
i
am
now
about
to
tell
of
us
the
generals
who
are
ten
in
number
the
opinions
are
divided
the
one
party
urging
that
we
fight
a
battle
and
the
others
that
we
do
not
fight
now
if
we
do
not
i
expect
that
some
great
spirit
of
discord
will
fall
upon
the
minds
of
the
athenians
and
so
shake
them
that
they
shall
go
over
to
the
medes
but
if
we
fight
a
battle
before
any
unsoundness
appear
in
any
part
of
the
athenian
people
then
we
are
able
to
gain
the
victory
in
the
fight
if
the
gods
grant
equal
conditions
these
things
then
all
belong
to
thee
and
depend
on
thee
for
if
thou
attach
thyself
to
my
opinions
thou
hast
both
a
fatherland
which
is
free
and
a
native
city
which
shall
be
the
first
among
the
cities
of
hellas
but
if
thou
choose
the
opinion
of
those
who
are
earnest
against
fighting
thou
shalt
have
the
opposite
of
those
good
things
of
which
i
told
thus
speaking
miltiades
gained
callimachos
to
his
side
and
the
opinion
of
the
polemarch
being
added
it
was
thus
determined
to
fight
a
battle
after
this
those
generals
whose
opinion
was
in
favour
of
fighting
as
the
turn
of
each
one
of
them
to
command
for
the
day
came
round
gave
over
their
command
to
miltiades
and
he
accepting
it
would
not
however
yet
bring
about
a
battle
until
his
own
turn
to
command
had
and
when
it
came
round
to
him
then
the
athenians
were
drawn
up
for
battle
in
the
order
which
here
follows
on
the
right
wing
the
polemarch
callimachos
was
leader
for
the
custom
of
the
athenians
then
was
this
that
the
polemarch
should
have
the
right
wing
and
he
leading
next
after
him
came
the
tribes
in
order
as
they
were
numbered
one
after
another
and
last
were
drawn
up
the
plataians
occupying
the
left
wing
for
ever
since
this
battle
when
the
athenians
offer
sacrifices
in
the
solemn
assemblies
which
are
made
at
the
festivals
the
herald
of
the
athenians
prays
thus
that
blessings
may
come
to
the
athenians
and
to
the
plataians
both
on
this
occasion
however
when
the
athenians
were
being
drawn
up
at
marathon
something
of
this
kind
was
done
their
army
being
made
equal
in
length
of
front
to
that
of
the
medes
came
to
drawn
up
in
the
middle
with
a
depth
of
but
few
ranks
and
here
their
army
was
weakest
while
each
wing
was
strengthened
with
and
when
they
had
been
arranged
in
their
places
and
the
sacrifices
proved
favourable
then
the
athenians
were
let
go
and
they
set
forth
at
a
run
to
attack
the
barbarians
now
the
space
between
the
armies
was
not
less
than
eight
furlongs
and
the
persians
seeing
them
advancing
to
the
attack
at
a
run
made
preparations
to
receive
them
and
in
their
minds
they
charged
the
athenians
with
madness
which
must
be
fatal
seeing
that
they
were
few
and
yet
were
pressing
forwards
at
a
run
having
neither
cavalry
nor
archers
such
was
the
thought
of
the
barbarians
but
the
athenians
when
all
in
a
body
they
had
joined
in
combat
with
the
barbarians
fought
in
a
memorable
fashion
for
they
were
the
first
of
all
the
hellenes
about
whom
we
know
who
went
to
attack
the
enemy
at
a
run
and
they
were
the
first
also
who
endured
to
face
the
median
garments
and
the
men
who
wore
them
whereas
up
to
this
time
the
very
name
of
the
medes
was
to
the
hellenes
a
terror
to
now
while
they
fought
in
marathon
much
time
passed
by
and
in
the
centre
of
the
army
where
the
persians
themselves
and
the
sacans
were
drawn
up
the
barbarians
were
winning
here
i
say
the
barbarians
had
broken
the
ranks
of
their
opponents
and
were
pursuing
them
inland
but
on
both
wings
the
athenians
and
the
plataians
severally
were
winning
the
victory
and
being
victorious
they
left
that
part
of
the
barbarians
which
had
been
routed
to
fly
without
molestation
and
bringing
together
the
two
wings
they
fought
with
those
who
had
broken
their
centre
and
the
athenians
were
victorious
so
they
followed
after
the
persians
as
they
fled
slaughtering
them
until
they
came
to
the
sea
and
then
they
called
for
fire
and
began
to
take
hold
of
the
in
this
part
of
the
work
was
slain
the
polemarch
callimachos
after
having
proved
himself
a
good
man
and
also
one
of
the
generals
stesilaos
the
son
of
thrasylaos
was
killed
and
besides
this
kynegeiros
the
son
of
euphorion
while
taking
hold
there
of
the
ornament
at
the
stern
of
a
ship
had
his
hand
cut
off
with
an
axe
and
fell
and
many
others
also
of
the
athenians
who
were
men
of
note
were
seven
of
the
ships
the
athenians
got
possession
of
in
this
manner
but
with
the
rest
the
barbarians
pushed
off
from
land
and
after
taking
the
captives
from
eretria
off
the
island
where
they
had
left
them
they
sailed
round
sunion
purposing
to
arrive
at
the
city
before
the
athenians
and
an
accusation
became
current
among
the
athenians
to
the
effect
that
they
formed
this
design
by
contrivance
of
the
alcmaionidai
for
these
it
was
said
having
concerted
matters
with
the
persians
displayed
to
them
a
shield
when
they
had
now
embarked
in
their
these
then
i
say
were
sailing
round
sunion
and
meanwhile
the
athenians
came
to
the
rescue
back
to
the
city
as
speedily
as
they
could
and
they
arrived
there
before
the
barbarians
came
and
having
arrived
from
the
temple
of
heracles
at
marathon
they
encamped
at
another
temple
of
heracles
namely
that
which
is
in
kynosarges
the
barbarians
however
came
and
lay
with
their
ships
in
the
sea
which
is
off
phaleron
for
this
was
then
the
seaport
of
the
athenians
they
anchored
their
ships
i
say
off
this
place
and
then
proceeded
to
sail
back
to
asia
in
this
fight
at
marathon
there
were
slain
of
the
barbarians
about
six
thousand
four
hundred
men
and
of
the
athenians
a
hundred
and
ninety
and
two
such
was
the
number
which
fell
on
both
sides
and
it
happened
also
that
a
marvel
occurred
there
of
this
kind
an
athenian
epizelos
the
son
of
cuphagoras
while
fighting
in
the
close
combat
and
proving
himself
a
good
man
was
deprived
of
the
sight
of
his
eyes
neither
having
received
a
blow
in
any
part
of
his
body
nor
having
been
hit
with
a
missile
and
for
the
rest
of
his
life
from
this
time
he
continued
to
be
blind
and
i
was
informed
that
he
used
to
tell
about
that
which
had
happened
to
him
a
tale
of
this
kind
namely
that
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
tall
man
in
full
armour
stood
against
him
whose
beard
overshadowed
his
whole
shield
and
this
apparition
passed
him
by
but
killed
his
comrade
who
stood
next
to
him
thus
as
i
was
informed
epizelos
told
the
tale
datis
however
as
he
was
going
with
his
army
to
asia
when
he
had
come
to
myconos
saw
a
vision
in
his
sleep
and
of
what
nature
the
vision
was
it
is
not
reported
but
as
soon
as
day
dawned
he
caused
a
search
to
be
made
of
the
ships
and
finding
in
a
phenician
ship
an
image
of
apollo
overlaid
with
gold
he
inquired
from
whence
it
had
been
carried
off
then
having
been
informed
from
what
temple
it
came
he
sailed
in
his
own
ship
to
delos
and
finding
that
the
delians
had
returned
then
to
the
island
he
deposited
the
image
in
the
temple
and
charged
the
men
of
delos
to
convey
it
back
to
delion
in
the
territory
of
the
thebans
which
is
situated
by
the
just
opposite
chalkis
datis
having
given
this
charge
sailed
away
the
delians
however
did
not
convey
the
statue
back
but
after
an
interval
of
twenty
years
the
thebans
themselves
brought
it
to
delion
by
reason
of
an
now
as
to
those
eretrians
who
had
been
reduced
to
slavery
datis
and
artaphrenes
when
they
reached
asia
in
their
voyage
brought
them
up
to
susa
and
king
dareios
though
he
had
great
anger
against
the
eretrians
before
they
were
made
captive
because
the
eretrians
had
done
wrong
to
him
unprovoked
yet
when
he
saw
that
they
had
been
brought
up
to
him
and
were
in
his
power
he
did
them
no
more
evil
but
established
them
as
settlers
in
the
kissian
land
upon
one
of
his
own
domains
of
which
the
name
is
ardericca
and
this
is
distant
two
hundred
and
ten
furlongs
from
susa
and
forty
from
the
well
which
produces
things
of
three
different
kinds
for
they
draw
from
it
asphalt
salt
and
oil
in
the
manner
which
here
follows
the
liquid
is
drawn
with
a
swipe
to
which
there
is
fastened
half
a
skin
instead
of
a
bucket
and
a
man
strikes
this
down
into
it
and
draws
up
and
then
pours
it
into
a
cistern
from
which
it
runs
through
into
another
vessel
taking
three
separate
ways
the
asphalt
and
the
salt
become
solid
at
once
and
the
oil
which
is
called
by
the
persians
rhadinake
is
black
and
gives
out
a
disagreeable
smell
here
king
dareios
established
the
eretrians
as
settlers
and
even
to
my
time
they
continued
to
occupy
this
land
keeping
still
their
former
language
thus
it
happened
with
regard
to
the
eretrians
of
the
lacedemonians
there
came
to
athens
two
thousand
after
the
full
moon
making
great
haste
to
be
in
time
so
that
they
arrived
in
attica
on
the
third
day
after
leaving
sparta
and
though
they
had
come
too
late
for
the
battle
yet
they
desired
to
behold
the
medes
and
accordingly
they
went
out
to
marathon
and
looked
at
the
bodies
of
the
slain
then
afterwards
they
departed
home
commending
the
athenians
and
the
work
which
they
had
done
now
it
is
a
cause
of
wonder
to
me
and
i
do
not
accept
the
report
that
the
alcmaionidai
could
ever
have
displayed
to
the
persians
a
shield
by
a
previous
understanding
with
the
desire
that
the
athenians
should
be
under
the
barbarians
and
under
hippias
seeing
that
they
are
evidently
proved
to
have
been
haters
of
despots
as
much
or
more
than
callias
the
son
of
phainippos
and
father
of
hipponicos
while
callias
for
his
part
was
the
only
man
of
all
the
athenians
who
dared
when
peisistratos
was
driven
out
of
athens
to
buy
his
goods
offered
for
sale
by
the
state
and
in
other
ways
also
he
contrived
against
him
everything
that
was
most
hostile
of
this
callias
it
is
fitting
that
every
one
should
have
remembrance
for
many
reasons
first
because
of
that
which
has
been
before
said
namely
that
he
was
a
man
of
excellence
in
freeing
his
country
and
then
also
for
that
which
he
did
at
the
olympic
games
wherein
he
gained
a
victory
in
the
and
was
second
in
the
and
he
had
before
this
been
a
victor
at
the
pythian
games
so
that
he
was
distinguished
in
the
sight
of
all
hellenes
by
the
sums
which
he
expended
and
finally
because
he
showed
himself
a
man
of
such
liberality
towards
his
daughters
who
were
three
in
number
for
when
they
came
to
be
of
ripe
age
for
marriage
he
gave
them
a
most
magnificent
dowry
and
also
indulged
their
inclinations
for
whomsoever
of
all
the
athenians
each
one
of
them
desired
to
choose
as
a
husband
for
herself
to
that
man
he
gave
her
and
similarly
the
alcmaionidai
were
haters
of
despots
equally
or
more
than
he
therefore
this
is
a
cause
of
wonder
to
me
and
i
do
not
admit
the
accusation
that
these
they
were
who
displayed
the
shield
seeing
that
they
were
in
exile
from
the
despots
during
their
whole
time
and
that
by
their
contrivance
the
sons
of
peisistratos
gave
up
their
rule
thus
it
follows
that
they
were
the
men
who
set
athens
free
much
more
than
harmodios
and
aristogeiton
as
i
judge
for
these
my
slaying
hipparchos
exasperated
the
rest
of
the
family
of
peisistratos
and
did
not
at
all
cause
the
others
to
cease
from
their
despotism
but
the
alcmaionidai
did
evidently
set
athens
free
at
least
if
these
were
in
truth
the
men
who
persuaded
the
pythian
prophetess
to
signify
to
the
lacedemonians
that
they
should
set
athens
free
as
i
have
set
forth
it
may
be
said
however
that
they
had
some
cause
of
complaint
against
the
people
of
the
athenians
and
therefore
endeavoured
to
betray
their
native
city
but
on
the
contrary
there
were
no
men
in
greater
repute
than
they
among
the
athenians
at
least
nor
who
had
been
more
highly
honoured
thus
it
is
not
reasonable
to
suppose
that
by
them
a
shield
should
have
been
displayed
for
any
such
purpose
a
shield
was
displayed
however
that
can
not
be
denied
for
it
was
done
but
as
to
who
it
was
who
displayed
it
i
am
not
able
to
say
more
than
this
now
the
family
of
alcmaionidai
was
distinguished
in
athens
in
the
earliest
times
also
and
from
the
time
of
alcmaion
and
of
megacles
after
him
they
became
very
greatly
distinguished
for
first
alcmaion
the
son
of
megacles
showed
himself
a
helper
of
the
lydians
from
sardis
who
came
from
croesus
to
the
oracle
at
delphi
and
assisted
them
with
zeal
and
croesus
having
heard
from
the
lydians
who
went
to
the
oracle
that
this
man
did
him
service
sent
for
him
to
sardis
and
when
he
came
he
offered
to
give
him
a
gift
of
as
much
gold
as
he
could
carry
away
at
once
upon
his
own
person
with
a
view
to
this
gift
its
nature
being
such
alcmaion
made
preparations
and
used
appliances
as
follows
he
put
on
a
large
tunic
leaving
a
deep
fold
in
the
tunic
to
hang
down
in
front
and
he
draw
on
his
feet
the
widest
boots
which
he
could
find
and
so
went
to
the
treasury
to
which
they
conducted
him
then
he
fell
upon
a
heap
of
and
first
he
packed
in
by
the
side
of
his
legs
so
much
of
the
gold
as
his
boots
would
contain
and
then
he
filled
the
whole
fold
of
the
tunic
with
the
gold
and
sprinkled
some
of
the
gold
dust
on
the
hair
of
his
head
and
took
some
into
his
mouth
and
having
so
done
he
came
forth
out
of
the
treasury
with
difficulty
dragging
along
his
boots
and
resembling
anything
in
the
world
rather
than
a
man
for
his
mouth
was
stuffed
full
and
every
part
of
him
was
swelled
out
and
upon
croesus
came
laughter
when
he
saw
him
and
he
not
only
gave
him
all
that
but
also
presented
him
in
addition
with
more
not
inferior
in
value
to
that
thus
this
house
became
exceedingly
wealthy
and
thus
the
alcmaion
of
whom
i
speak
became
a
breeder
of
and
won
a
victory
at
then
in
the
next
generation
after
this
cleisthenes
the
despot
of
sikyon
exalted
the
family
so
that
it
became
of
much
more
note
among
the
hellenes
than
it
had
been
formerly
for
cleisthenes
the
son
of
arisonymos
the
son
of
myron
the
son
of
andreas
had
a
daughter
whose
name
was
agariste
and
as
to
her
he
formed
a
desire
to
find
out
the
best
man
of
all
the
hellenes
and
to
assign
her
to
him
in
marriage
so
when
the
olympic
games
were
being
held
and
cleisthenes
was
victor
in
them
with
a
chariot
he
caused
a
proclamation
to
be
made
that
whosoever
of
the
hellenes
thought
himself
worthy
to
be
the
of
cleisthenes
should
come
on
the
sixtieth
day
or
before
that
if
he
would
to
sikyon
for
cleisthenes
intended
to
conclude
the
marriage
within
a
year
reckoning
from
the
sixtieth
day
then
all
those
of
the
hellenes
who
had
pride
either
in
themselves
or
in
their
high
descent
came
as
wooers
and
for
them
cleisthenes
had
a
and
a
made
and
kept
them
expressly
for
their
from
italy
came
smindyrides
the
son
of
hippocrates
of
sybaris
who
of
all
men
on
earth
reached
the
highest
point
of
luxury
now
sybaris
at
this
time
was
in
the
height
of
its
prosperity
and
damasos
of
siris
the
son
of
that
amyris
who
was
called
the
wise
these
came
from
italy
from
the
ionian
gulf
came
amphimnestos
the
son
of
epistrophos
of
epidamnos
this
man
from
the
ionian
gulf
from
aitolia
came
males
the
brother
of
that
titormos
who
surpassed
all
the
hellenes
in
strength
and
who
fled
from
the
presence
of
men
to
the
furthest
extremities
of
the
aitolian
land
from
peloponnesus
leokedes
the
son
of
pheidon
the
despot
of
the
argives
that
pheidon
who
established
for
the
peloponnesians
the
measures
which
they
use
and
who
went
beyond
all
other
hellenes
in
wanton
insolence
since
he
removed
from
their
place
the
presidents
of
the
games
appointed
by
the
eleians
and
himself
presided
over
the
games
at
olympia
his
son
i
say
and
amiantos
the
son
of
lycurgos
an
arcadian
from
trapezus
and
laphanes
an
azanian
from
the
city
of
paios
son
of
that
euphorion
who
according
to
the
story
told
in
arcadia
received
the
dioscuroi
as
guests
in
his
house
and
from
thenceforth
was
wont
to
entertain
all
men
who
came
and
onomastos
the
son
of
agaios
of
elis
these
i
say
came
from
peloponnesus
itself
from
athens
came
megacles
the
son
of
that
alcmaion
who
went
to
croesus
and
besides
him
hippocleides
the
son
of
tisander
one
who
surpassed
the
other
athenians
in
wealth
and
in
comeliness
of
form
from
eretria
which
at
that
time
was
flourishing
came
lysanias
he
alone
from
euboea
from
thessalia
came
diactorides
of
crannon
one
of
the
family
of
the
scopadai
and
from
the
molossians
so
many
in
number
did
the
wooers
prove
to
be
and
when
these
had
come
by
the
appointed
day
cleisthenes
first
inquired
of
their
native
countries
and
of
the
descent
of
each
one
and
then
keeping
them
for
a
year
he
made
trial
continually
both
of
their
manly
virtue
and
of
their
disposition
training
and
temper
associating
both
with
each
one
separately
and
with
the
whole
number
together
and
he
made
trial
of
them
both
by
bringing
out
to
bodily
exercises
those
of
them
who
were
younger
and
also
especially
in
the
common
feast
for
during
all
the
time
that
he
kept
them
he
did
everything
that
could
be
done
and
at
the
same
time
he
entertained
them
magnificently
now
it
chanced
that
those
of
the
wooers
pleased
him
most
who
had
come
from
athens
and
of
these
hippocleides
the
son
of
tisander
was
rather
preferred
both
by
reason
of
manly
virtues
and
also
because
he
was
connected
by
descent
with
the
family
of
kypselos
at
corinth
then
when
the
appointed
day
came
for
the
marriage
banquet
and
for
cleisthenes
himself
to
declare
whom
he
selected
from
the
whole
number
cleisthenes
sacrificed
a
hundred
oxen
and
feasted
both
the
wooers
themselves
and
all
the
people
of
sikyon
and
when
the
dinner
was
over
the
wooers
began
to
vie
with
one
another
both
in
music
and
in
speeches
for
the
entertainment
of
the
company
and
as
the
drinking
went
forward
and
hippocleides
was
very
much
holding
the
attention
of
the
others
he
bade
the
play
for
him
a
and
when
the
did
so
he
danced
and
it
so
befell
that
he
pleased
himself
in
his
dancing
but
cleisthenes
looked
on
at
the
whole
matter
with
suspicion
then
hippocleides
after
a
certain
time
bade
one
bring
in
a
table
and
when
the
table
came
in
first
he
danced
upon
it
laconian
figures
and
then
also
attic
and
thirdly
he
planted
his
head
upon
the
table
and
gesticulated
with
his
legs
cleisthenes
meanwhile
when
he
was
dancing
the
first
and
the
second
time
though
he
abhorred
the
thought
that
hippocleides
should
now
become
his
because
of
his
dancing
and
his
shamelessness
yet
restrained
himself
not
desiring
to
break
out
in
anger
against
him
but
when
he
saw
that
he
thus
gesticulated
with
his
legs
he
was
no
longer
able
to
restrain
himself
but
said
thou
hast
danced
away
thy
marriage
however
son
of
tisander
and
hippocleides
answered
and
said
hippocleides
cares
not
and
hence
comes
this
saying
then
cleisthenes
caused
silence
to
be
made
and
spoke
to
the
company
as
follows
men
who
are
wooers
of
my
daughter
i
commend
you
all
and
if
it
were
possible
i
would
gratify
you
all
neither
selecting
one
of
you
to
be
preferred
nor
rejecting
the
remainder
since
however
it
is
not
possible
as
i
am
deliberating
about
one
maiden
only
to
act
so
as
to
please
all
therefore
to
those
of
you
who
are
rejected
from
this
marriage
i
give
as
a
gift
a
talent
of
silver
to
each
one
for
the
worthy
estimation
ye
had
of
me
in
that
ye
desired
to
marry
from
my
house
and
for
the
time
of
absence
from
your
homes
and
to
the
son
of
alcmaion
megacles
i
offer
my
daughter
agariste
in
betrothal
according
to
the
customs
of
the
athenians
thereupon
megacles
said
that
he
accepted
the
betrothal
and
so
the
marriage
was
determined
by
cleisthenes
thus
it
happened
as
regards
the
judgment
of
the
wooers
and
thus
the
alcmaionidai
got
renown
over
all
hellas
and
these
having
been
married
there
was
born
to
them
that
cleisthenes
who
established
the
tribes
and
the
democracy
for
the
athenians
he
being
called
after
the
sikyonian
cleisthenes
his
mother
father
this
son
i
say
was
born
to
megacles
and
also
hippocrates
and
of
hippocrates
came
another
megacles
and
another
agariste
called
after
agariste
the
daughter
of
cleisthenes
who
having
been
married
to
xanthippos
the
son
of
ariphron
and
being
with
child
saw
a
vision
in
her
sleep
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
brought
forth
a
lion
then
after
a
few
days
she
bore
to
xanthippos
pericles
after
the
defeat
at
marathon
miltiades
who
even
before
was
well
reputed
with
the
athenians
came
then
to
be
in
much
higher
estimation
and
when
he
asked
the
athenians
for
seventy
ships
and
an
army
with
supplies
of
money
not
declaring
to
them
against
what
land
he
was
intending
to
make
an
expedition
but
saying
that
he
would
enrich
them
greatly
if
they
would
go
with
him
for
he
would
lead
them
to
a
land
of
such
a
kind
that
they
would
easily
get
from
it
gold
in
abundance
thus
saying
he
asked
for
the
ships
and
the
athenians
elated
by
these
words
delivered
them
over
to
then
miltiades
when
he
had
received
the
army
proceeded
to
sail
to
paris
with
the
pretence
that
the
parians
had
first
attacked
athens
by
making
expedition
with
triremes
to
marathon
in
company
with
the
persian
this
was
the
pretext
which
he
put
forward
but
he
had
also
a
grudge
against
the
parians
on
account
of
lysagoras
the
son
of
tisias
who
was
by
race
of
paros
for
having
accused
him
to
hydarnes
the
persian
so
when
miltiades
had
arrived
at
the
place
to
which
he
was
sailing
he
began
to
besiege
the
parians
with
his
army
first
having
shut
them
up
within
their
wall
and
sending
in
to
them
a
herald
he
asked
for
a
hundred
talents
saying
that
if
they
refused
to
give
them
his
army
should
not
return
back
until
it
had
conquered
them
completely
the
parians
however
had
no
design
of
giving
any
money
to
miltiades
but
contrived
only
how
they
might
defend
their
city
devising
various
things
besides
and
also
this
wherever
at
any
time
the
wall
proved
to
be
open
to
attack
that
point
was
raised
when
night
came
on
to
double
its
former
so
much
of
the
story
is
reported
by
all
the
hellenes
but
as
to
what
followed
the
parians
alone
report
and
they
say
that
it
happened
thus
when
miltiades
was
at
a
loss
it
is
said
there
came
a
woman
to
speech
with
him
who
had
been
taken
prisoner
a
parian
by
race
whose
name
was
timo
an
of
the
earth
goddesses
she
they
say
came
into
the
presence
of
miltiades
and
counselled
him
that
if
he
considered
it
a
matter
of
much
moment
to
conquer
paros
he
could
do
that
which
she
should
suggest
to
him
and
upon
that
she
told
him
her
meaning
he
accordingly
passed
through
to
the
hill
which
is
before
the
city
and
leapt
over
the
fence
of
the
temple
of
demeter
giver
of
laws
not
being
able
to
open
the
door
and
then
having
leapt
over
he
went
on
towards
the
sanctuary
with
the
design
of
doing
something
within
whether
it
were
that
he
meant
to
lay
hands
on
some
of
the
things
which
should
not
be
touched
or
whatever
else
he
intended
to
do
and
when
he
had
reached
the
door
forthwith
a
shuddering
fear
came
over
him
and
he
set
off
to
go
back
the
same
way
as
he
came
and
as
he
leapt
down
from
the
wall
of
rough
stones
his
thigh
was
dislocated
or
as
others
say
he
struck
his
knee
against
the
miltiades
accordingly
being
in
a
wretched
case
set
forth
to
sail
homewards
neither
bringing
wealth
to
the
athenians
nor
having
added
to
them
the
possession
of
paros
but
having
besieged
the
city
for
days
and
laid
waste
the
island
and
the
parians
being
informed
that
timo
the
of
the
goddesses
had
acted
as
a
guide
to
miltiades
desired
to
take
vengeance
upon
her
for
this
and
they
sent
messengers
to
delphi
to
consult
the
god
so
soon
as
they
had
leisure
from
the
siege
and
these
messengers
they
sent
to
ask
whether
they
should
put
to
death
the
of
the
goddesses
who
had
been
a
guide
to
their
enemies
for
the
capture
of
her
native
city
and
had
revealed
to
miltiades
the
mysteries
which
might
not
be
uttered
to
a
male
person
the
pythian
prophetess
however
forbade
them
saying
that
timo
was
not
the
true
author
of
these
things
but
since
it
was
destined
that
miltiades
should
end
his
life
not
well
she
had
appeared
to
guide
him
to
his
evil
thus
the
pythian
prophetess
replied
to
the
parians
and
the
athenians
when
miltiades
had
returned
back
from
paros
began
to
talk
of
him
and
among
the
rest
especially
xanthippos
the
son
of
ariphron
who
brought
miltiades
up
before
the
people
claiming
the
penalty
of
death
and
prosecuted
him
for
his
deception
of
the
athenians
and
miltiades
did
not
himself
make
his
own
defence
although
he
was
present
for
he
was
unable
to
do
so
because
his
thigh
was
mortifying
but
he
lay
in
public
view
upon
a
bed
while
his
friends
made
a
defence
for
him
making
mention
much
both
of
the
battle
which
had
been
fought
at
marathon
and
of
the
conquest
of
lemnos
namely
how
he
had
conquered
lemnos
and
taken
vengeance
on
the
pelasgians
and
had
delivered
it
over
to
the
athenians
and
the
people
came
over
to
his
part
as
regards
the
acquittal
from
the
penalty
of
death
but
they
imposed
a
fine
of
fifty
talents
for
the
wrong
committed
and
after
this
miltiades
died
his
thigh
having
gangrened
and
mortified
and
the
fifty
talents
were
paid
by
his
son
kimon
now
miltiades
son
of
kimon
had
thus
taken
possession
of
the
lemnos
after
the
pelasgians
had
been
cast
out
of
attica
by
the
athenians
whether
justly
or
unjustly
for
about
this
i
can
not
tell
except
the
things
reported
which
are
these
hecataois
on
the
one
hand
the
son
of
hegesander
said
in
his
history
that
it
was
done
unjustly
for
he
said
that
when
the
athenians
saw
the
land
which
extends
below
hymettos
which
they
had
themselves
given
them
to
dwell
in
as
payment
for
the
wall
built
round
the
acropolis
in
former
times
when
the
athenians
i
say
saw
that
this
land
was
made
good
by
cultivation
which
before
was
bad
and
worthless
they
were
seized
with
jealousy
and
with
longing
to
possess
the
land
and
so
drove
them
out
not
alleging
any
other
pretext
but
according
to
the
report
of
the
athenians
themselves
they
drove
them
out
justly
for
the
pelasgians
being
settled
under
hymettos
made
this
a
and
committed
wrong
against
them
as
follows
the
daughters
and
sons
of
the
athenians
were
wont
ever
to
go
for
water
to
the
spring
of
enneacrunos
for
at
that
time
neither
they
nor
the
other
hellenes
as
yet
had
household
servants
and
when
these
girls
came
the
pelasgians
in
wantonness
and
contempt
of
the
athenians
would
offer
them
violence
and
it
was
not
enough
for
them
even
to
do
this
but
at
last
they
were
found
in
the
act
of
plotting
an
attack
upon
the
city
and
the
narrators
say
that
they
herein
proved
themselves
better
men
than
the
pelasgians
inasmuch
as
when
they
might
have
slain
the
pelasgians
who
had
been
caught
plotting
against
them
they
did
not
choose
to
do
so
but
ordered
them
merely
to
depart
out
of
the
land
and
thus
having
departed
out
of
the
land
the
pelasgians
took
possession
of
several
older
places
and
especially
of
lemnos
the
former
story
is
that
which
was
reported
by
hecataios
while
the
latter
is
that
which
is
told
by
the
these
pelasgians
then
dwelling
after
that
in
lemnos
desired
to
take
vengeance
on
the
athenians
and
having
full
knowledge
also
of
the
festivals
of
the
athenians
they
got
galleys
and
laid
wait
for
the
women
of
the
athenians
when
they
were
keeping
festival
to
artemis
in
brauron
and
having
carried
off
a
number
of
them
from
thence
they
departed
and
sailed
away
home
and
taking
the
women
to
lemnos
they
kept
them
as
concubines
now
when
these
women
had
children
gradually
more
and
more
they
made
it
their
practice
to
teach
their
sons
both
the
attic
tongue
and
the
manners
of
the
athenians
and
these
were
not
willing
to
associate
with
the
sons
of
the
pelasgian
women
and
moreover
if
any
of
them
were
struck
by
any
one
of
those
they
all
in
a
body
came
to
the
rescue
and
helped
one
another
moreover
the
boys
claimed
to
have
authority
over
the
other
boys
and
got
the
better
of
them
easily
perceiving
these
things
the
pelasgians
considered
the
matter
and
when
they
took
counsel
together
a
fear
came
over
them
and
they
thought
if
the
boys
were
indeed
resolved
now
to
help
one
another
against
the
sons
of
the
legitimate
wives
and
were
endeavouring
already
from
the
first
to
have
authority
over
them
what
would
they
do
when
they
were
grown
up
to
be
men
then
they
determined
to
put
to
death
the
sons
of
the
athenian
women
and
this
they
actually
did
and
in
addition
to
them
they
slew
their
mothers
also
from
this
deed
and
from
that
which
was
done
before
this
which
the
women
did
when
they
killed
thoas
and
the
rest
who
were
their
own
husbands
it
has
become
a
custom
in
hellas
that
all
deeds
of
great
cruelty
should
be
called
lemnian
after
the
pelasgians
had
killed
their
own
sons
and
wives
the
earth
did
not
bear
fruit
for
them
nor
did
their
women
or
their
cattle
bring
forth
young
as
they
did
before
and
being
hard
pressed
by
famine
and
by
childlessness
they
sent
to
delphi
to
ask
for
a
release
from
the
evils
which
were
upon
them
and
the
pythian
prophetess
bade
them
pay
such
penalty
to
the
athenians
as
the
athenians
themselves
should
appoint
the
pelasgians
came
accordingly
to
athens
and
professed
that
they
were
willing
to
pay
the
penalty
for
all
the
wrong
which
they
had
done
and
the
athenians
laid
a
couch
in
the
fairest
possible
manner
in
the
city
hall
and
having
set
by
it
a
table
covered
with
all
good
things
they
bade
the
pelasgians
deliver
up
to
them
their
land
in
that
condition
then
the
pelasgians
answered
and
said
when
with
a
north
wind
in
one
single
day
a
ship
shall
accomplish
the
voyage
from
your
land
to
ours
then
we
will
deliver
it
up
feeling
assured
that
it
was
impossible
for
this
to
happen
since
attica
lies
far
away
to
the
south
of
such
were
the
events
which
happened
then
and
very
many
years
later
after
the
chersonese
which
is
by
the
hellespont
had
come
to
be
under
the
athenians
miltiades
the
son
of
kimon
when
the
etesian
winds
blew
steadily
accomplished
the
voyage
in
a
ship
from
elaius
in
the
chersonese
to
lemnos
and
proclaimed
to
the
pelasgians
that
they
should
depart
out
of
the
island
reminding
them
of
the
oracle
which
the
pelasgians
had
never
expected
would
be
accomplished
for
them
the
men
of
hephaistia
accordingly
obeyed
but
those
of
myrina
not
admitting
that
the
chersonese
was
attica
suffered
a
siege
until
at
last
these
also
submitted
thus
it
was
that
the
athenians

not
only
ships
of
war
but
also
horses
and
provisions
and
transport
vessels
and
when
these
commands
were
carried
round
all
asia
was
moved
for
three
years
for
all
the
best
men
were
being
enlisted
for
the
expedition
against
hellas
and
were
making
preparations
in
the
fourth
year
however
the
egyptians
who
had
been
reduced
to
subjection
by
cambyses
revolted
from
the
persians
and
then
he
was
even
more
desirous
of
marching
against
both
these
nations
while
dareios
was
thus
preparing
to
set
out
against
egypt
and
against
athens
there
arose
a
great
strife
among
his
sons
about
the
supreme
power
and
they
said
that
he
must
not
make
his
expeditions
until
he
had
designated
one
of
them
to
be
king
according
to
the
custom
of
the
persians
for
to
dareios
already
before
he
became
king
three
sons
had
been
born
of
his
former
wife
the
daughter
of
gobryas
and
after
he
became
king
four
other
sons
of
atossa
the
daughter
of
cyrus
of
the
first
the
eldest
was
artobazanes
and
of
those
who
had
been
born
later
xerxes
these
being
not
of
the
same
mother
were
at
strife
with
one
another
artobazanes
contending
that
he
was
the
eldest
of
all
the
sons
and
that
it
was
a
custom
maintained
by
all
men
that
the
eldest
should
have
the
rule
and
xerxes
arguing
that
he
was
the
son
of
atossa
the
daughter
of
cyrus
and
that
cyrus
was
he
who
had
won
for
the
persians
their
freedom
now
while
dareios
did
not
as
yet
declare
his
judgment
it
chanced
that
demaratos
also
the
son
of
ariston
had
come
up
to
susa
at
this
very
same
time
having
been
deprived
of
the
kingdom
in
sparta
and
having
laid
upon
himself
a
sentence
of
exile
from
lacedemon
this
man
hearing
of
the
difference
between
the
sons
of
dareios
came
as
it
is
reported
of
him
and
counselled
xerxes
to
say
in
addition
to
those
things
which
he
was
wont
to
say
that
he
had
been
born
to
dareios
at
the
time
when
he
was
already
reigning
as
king
and
was
holding
the
supreme
power
over
the
persians
while
artobazanes
had
been
born
while
dareios
was
still
in
a
private
station
it
was
not
fitting
therefore
nor
just
that
another
should
have
the
honour
before
him
for
even
in
sparta
suggested
demaratos
this
was
the
custom
that
is
to
say
if
some
of
the
sons
had
been
born
first
before
their
father
began
to
reign
and
another
came
after
born
later
while
he
was
reigning
the
succession
of
the
kingdom
belonged
to
him
who
had
been
born
later
xerxes
accordingly
made
use
of
the
suggestion
of
demaratos
and
dareios
perceiving
that
he
spoke
that
which
was
just
designated
him
to
be
king
it
is
my
opinion
however
that
even
without
this
suggestion
xerxes
would
have
become
king
for
atossa
was
then
having
designated
xerxes
to
the
persians
as
their
king
dareios
wished
to
go
on
his
expeditions
however
in
the
next
year
after
this
and
after
the
revolt
of
egypt
it
came
to
pass
that
dareios
himself
died
having
been
king
in
all
years
and
thus
he
did
not
succeed
in
taking
vengeance
either
upon
the
revolted
egyptians
or
upon
the
athenians
dareios
being
dead
the
kingdom
passed
to
his
son
xerxes
now
xerxes
at
the
first
was
by
no
means
anxious
to
make
a
march
against
hellas
but
against
egypt
he
continued
to
gather
a
force
mardonios
however
the
son
of
gobryas
who
was
a
cousin
of
xerxes
being
sister
son
to
dareios
was
ever
at
his
side
and
having
power
with
him
more
than
any
other
of
the
persians
he
kept
continually
to
such
discourse
as
this
which
follows
saying
master
it
is
not
fitting
that
the
athenians
after
having
done
to
the
persians
very
great
evil
should
not
pay
the
penalty
for
that
which
they
have
done
what
if
thou
shouldest
at
this
present
time
do
that
which
thou
hast
in
thy
hands
to
do
and
when
thou
hast
tamed
the
land
of
egypt
which
has
broken
out
insolently
against
us
then
do
thou
march
an
army
against
athens
that
a
good
report
may
be
made
of
thee
by
men
and
that
in
future
every
one
may
beware
of
making
expeditions
against
thy
land
thus
far
his
speech
had
to
do
with
vengeance
and
to
this
he
would
make
addition
as
follows
saying
that
europe
was
a
very
fair
land
and
bore
all
kinds
of
trees
that
are
cultivated
for
fruit
and
was
of
excellent
fertility
and
such
that
the
king
alone
of
all
mortals
was
worthy
to
possess
it
these
things
he
was
wont
to
say
since
he
was
one
who
had
a
desire
for
perilous
enterprise
and
wished
to
be
himself
the
governor
of
hellas
under
the
king
so
in
time
he
prevailed
upon
xerxes
and
persuaded
him
to
do
this
for
other
things
also
assisted
him
and
proved
helpful
to
him
in
persuading
xerxes
in
the
first
place
there
had
come
from
thessaly
messengers
sent
by
the
aleuadai
who
were
inviting
the
king
to
come
against
hellas
and
were
showing
great
zeal
in
his
cause
now
these
aleuadai
were
kings
of
thessaly
and
then
secondly
those
of
the
sons
of
peisistratos
who
had
come
up
to
susa
were
inviting
him
also
holding
to
the
same
arguments
as
the
aleuadai
and
moreover
they
offered
him
yet
more
inducement
in
addition
to
these
for
there
was
one
onomacritos
an
athenian
who
both
uttered
oracles
and
also
had
collected
and
arranged
the
oracles
of
musaios
and
with
this
man
they
had
come
up
after
they
had
first
reconciled
the
enmity
between
them
for
onomacritos
had
been
driven
forth
from
athens
by
hipparchos
the
son
of
peisistratos
having
been
caught
by
lasos
of
hermion
interpolating
in
the
works
of
musaios
an
oracle
to
the
effect
that
the
islands
which
lie
off
lemnos
should
disappear
under
the
sea
for
this
reason
hipparchos
drove
him
forth
having
before
this
time
been
very
much
wont
to
consult
him
now
however
he
had
gone
up
with
them
and
when
he
had
come
into
the
presence
of
the
king
the
sons
of
peisistratos
spoke
of
him
in
magnificent
terms
and
he
repeated
some
of
the
oracles
and
if
there
was
in
them
anything
which
imported
disaster
to
the
barbarians
of
this
he
said
nothing
but
choosing
out
of
them
the
most
fortunate
things
he
told
how
it
was
destined
that
the
hellespont
should
be
yoked
with
a
bridge
by
a
persian
and
he
set
forth
the
manner
of
the
march
he
then
thus
urged
xerxes
with
oracles
while
the
sons
of
peisistratos
and
the
aleuadai
pressed
him
with
their
advice
so
when
xerxes
had
been
persuaded
to
make
an
expedition
against
hellas
then
in
the
next
year
after
the
death
of
dareios
he
made
a
march
first
against
those
who
had
revolted
having
subdued
these
and
having
reduced
all
egypt
to
slavery
much
greater
than
it
had
suffered
in
the
reign
of
dareios
he
entrusted
the
government
of
it
to
achaimenes
his
own
brother
a
son
of
dareios
now
this
achaimenes
being
a
governor
of
egypt
was
slain
afterwards
by
inaros
the
son
of
psammetichos
a
libyan
xerxes
then
after
the
conquest
of
egypt
being
about
to
take
in
hand
the
expedition
against
athens
summoned
a
chosen
assembly
of
the
best
men
among
the
persians
that
he
might
both
learn
their
opinions
and
himself
in
the
presence
of
all
declare
that
which
he
intended
to
do
and
when
they
were
assembled
xerxes
spoke
to
them
as
follows
a
persians
i
shall
not
be
the
first
to
establish
this
custom
in
your
nation
but
having
received
it
from
others
i
shall
follow
it
for
as
i
am
informed
by
those
who
are
older
than
myself
we
never
yet
have
kept
quiet
since
we
received
this
supremacy
in
succession
to
the
medes
when
cyrus
overthrew
astyages
but
god
thus
leads
us
and
for
ourselves
tends
to
good
that
we
are
busied
about
many
things
now
about
the
nations
which
cyrus
and
cambyses
and
my
father
dareios
subdued
and
added
to
their
possessions
there
is
no
need
for
me
to
speak
since
ye
know
well
and
as
for
me
from
the
day
when
i
received
by
inheritance
this
throne
upon
which
i
sit
i
carefully
considered
always
how
in
this
honourable
place
i
might
not
fall
short
of
those
who
have
been
before
me
nor
add
less
power
to
the
dominion
of
the
persians
and
thus
carefully
considering
i
find
a
way
by
which
not
only
glory
may
be
won
by
us
together
with
a
land
not
less
in
extent
nor
worse
than
that
which
we
now
possess
and
indeed
more
varied
in
its
productions
but
also
vengeance
and
retribution
may
be
brought
about
wherefore
i
have
assembled
you
together
now
in
order
that
i
may
communicate
to
you
that
which
i
have
it
in
my
mind
to
do
b
i
design
to
yoke
the
hellespont
with
a
bridge
and
to
march
an
army
through
europe
against
hellas
in
order
that
i
may
take
vengeance
on
the
athenians
for
all
the
things
which
they
have
done
both
to
the
persians
and
to
my
father
ye
saw
how
my
father
dareios
also
was
purposing
to
make
an
expedition
against
these
men
but
he
has
ended
his
life
and
did
not
succeed
in
taking
vengeance
upon
them
i
however
on
behalf
of
him
and
also
of
the
other
persians
will
not
cease
until
i
have
conquered
athens
and
burnt
it
with
fire
seeing
that
they
did
wrong
unprovoked
to
me
and
to
my
father
first
they
went
to
sardis
having
come
with
aristagoras
the
milesian
our
slave
and
they
set
fire
to
the
sacred
groves
and
the
temples
and
then
secondly
what
things
they
did
to
us
when
we
disembarked
in
their
land
at
the
time
when
datis
and
artaphrenes
were
commanders
of
our
army
ye
all
know
well
as
i
think
c
for
these
reasons
i
have
resolved
to
make
an
expedition
against
them
and
reckoning
i
find
in
the
matter
so
many
good
things
as
ye
shall
hear
if
we
shall
subdue
these
and
the
neighbours
of
these
who
dwell
in
the
land
of
pelops
the
phrygian
we
shall
cause
the
persian
land
to
have
the
same
boundaries
as
the
heaven
of
zeus
since
in
truth
upon
no
land
will
the
sun
look
down
which
borders
ours
but
i
with
your
help
shall
make
all
the
lands
into
one
land
having
passed
through
the
whole
extent
of
europe
for
i
am
informed
that
things
are
so
namely
that
there
is
no
city
of
men
nor
any
race
of
human
beings
remaining
which
will
be
able
to
come
to
a
contest
with
us
when
those
whom
i
just
now
mentioned
have
been
removed
out
of
the
way
thus
both
those
who
have
committed
wrong
against
us
will
have
the
yoke
of
slavery
and
also
those
who
have
not
committed
wrong
d
and
ye
will
please
me
best
if
ye
do
this
whensoever
i
shall
signify
to
you
the
time
at
which
ye
ought
to
come
ye
must
appear
every
one
of
you
with
zeal
for
the
service
and
whosoever
shall
come
with
a
force
best
equipped
to
him
i
will
give
gifts
such
as
are
accounted
in
our
land
to
be
the
most
honourable
thus
must
these
things
be
done
but
that
i
may
not
seem
to
you
to
be
following
my
own
counsel
alone
i
propose
the
matter
for
discussion
bidding
any
one
of
you
who
desires
it
declare
his
opinion
having
thus
spoken
he
ceased
and
after
him
mardonios
said
master
thou
dost
surpass
not
only
all
the
persians
who
were
before
thee
but
also
those
who
shall
come
after
since
thou
didst
not
only
attain
in
thy
words
to
that
which
is
best
and
truest
as
regards
other
matters
but
also
thou
wilt
not
permit
the
ionians
who
dwell
in
europe
to
make
a
mock
of
us
having
no
just
right
to
do
so
for
a
strange
thing
it
would
be
if
when
we
have
subdued
and
kept
as
our
servants
sacans
indians
ethiopians
assyrians
and
other
nations
many
in
number
and
great
who
have
done
no
wrong
to
the
persians
because
we
desired
to
add
to
our
dominions
we
should
not
take
vengeance
on
the
hellenes
who
committed
wrong
against
us
unprovoked
a
of
what
should
we
be
afraid
what
gathering
of
numbers
or
what
resources
of
money
for
their
manner
of
fight
we
know
and
as
for
their
resources
we
know
that
they
are
feeble
and
we
have
moreover
subdued
already
their
sons
those
i
mean
who
are
settled
in
our
land
and
are
called
ionians
aiolians
and
dorians
moreover
i
myself
formerly
made
trial
of
marching
against
these
men
being
commanded
thereto
by
thy
father
and
although
i
marched
as
far
as
macedonia
and
fell
but
little
short
of
coming
to
athens
itself
no
man
came
to
oppose
me
in
fight
b
and
yet
it
is
true
that
the
hellenes
make
wars
but
as
i
am
informed
very
much
without
wise
consideration
by
reason
of
obstinacy
and
want
of
skill
for
when
they
have
proclaimed
war
upon
one
another
they
find
out
first
the
fairest
and
smoothest
place
and
to
this
they
come
down
and
fight
so
that
even
the
victors
depart
from
the
fight
with
great
loss
and
as
to
the
vanquished
of
them
i
make
no
mention
at
all
for
they
are
utterly
destroyed
they
ought
however
being
men
who
speak
the
same
language
to
make
use
of
heralds
and
messengers
and
so
to
take
up
their
differences
and
settle
them
in
any
way
rather
than
by
battles
but
if
they
must
absolutely
war
with
one
another
they
ought
to
find
out
each
of
them
that
place
in
which
they
themselves
are
hardest
to
overcome
and
here
to
make
their
trial
therefore
the
hellenes
since
they
use
no
good
way
when
i
had
marched
as
far
as
the
land
of
macedonia
did
not
come
to
the
resolution
of
fighting
with
me
c
who
then
is
likely
to
set
himself
against
thee
o
king
offering
war
when
thou
art
leading
both
all
the
multitudes
of
asia
and
the
whole
number
of
the
ships
i
for
my
part
am
of
opinion
that
the
power
of
the
hellenes
has
not
attained
to
such
a
pitch
of
boldness
but
if
after
all
i
should
prove
to
be
deceived
in
my
judgment
and
they
stirred
up
by
inconsiderate
folly
should
come
to
battle
with
us
they
would
learn
that
we
are
the
best
of
all
men
in
the
matters
of
war
however
that
may
be
let
not
anything
be
left
untried
for
nothing
comes
of
itself
but
from
trial
all
things
are
wont
to
come
to
men
mardonios
having
thus
smoothed
over
the
resolution
expressed
by
xerxes
had
ceased
speaking
and
when
the
other
persians
were
silent
and
did
not
venture
to
declare
an
opinion
contrary
to
that
which
had
been
proposed
then
artabanos
the
son
of
hystaspes
being
father
brother
to
xerxes
and
having
reliance
upon
that
spoke
as
follows
a
o
king
if
opinions
opposed
to
one
another
be
not
spoken
it
is
not
possible
to
select
the
better
in
making
the
choice
but
one
must
accept
that
which
has
been
spoken
if
however
opposite
opinions
be
uttered
this
is
possible
just
as
we
do
not
distinguish
the
gold
which
is
free
from
alloy
when
it
is
alone
by
itself
but
when
we
rub
it
on
the
touchstone
in
comparison
with
other
gold
then
we
distinguish
that
which
is
the
better
now
i
gave
advice
to
thy
father
dareios
also
who
was
my
brother
not
to
march
against
the
scythians
men
who
occupied
no
abiding
city
in
any
part
of
the
earth
he
however
expecting
that
he
would
subdue
the
scythians
who
were
nomads
did
not
listen
to
me
but
he
made
a
march
and
came
back
from
it
with
the
loss
of
many
good
men
of
his
army
but
thou
o
king
art
intending
to
march
against
men
who
are
much
better
than
the
scythians
men
who
are
reported
to
be
excellent
both
by
sea
and
on
land
and
the
thing
which
is
to
be
feared
in
this
matter
it
is
right
that
i
should
declare
to
thee
b
thou
sayest
that
thou
wilt
yoke
the
hellespont
with
a
bridge
and
march
an
army
through
europe
to
hellas
now
supposing
it
chance
that
we
are
worsted
either
by
land
or
by
sea
or
even
both
for
the
men
are
reported
to
be
valiant
in
fight
and
we
may
judge
for
ourselves
that
it
is
so
since
the
athenians
by
themselves
destroyed
that
great
army
which
came
with
datis
and
artaphrenes
to
the
attic
land
suppose
however
that
they
do
not
succeed
in
both
yet
if
they
shall
attack
with
their
ships
and
conquer
in
a
and
then
sail
to
the
hellespont
and
break
up
the
bridge
this
of
itself
o
king
will
prove
to
be
a
great
peril
c
not
however
by
any
native
wisdom
of
my
own
do
i
conjecture
that
this
might
happen
i
am
conjecturing
only
such
a
misfortune
as
all
but
came
upon
us
at
the
former
time
when
thy
father
having
yoked
the
bosphorus
of
thracia
and
made
a
bridge
over
the
river
ister
had
crossed
over
to
go
against
the
scythians
at
that
time
the
scythians
used
every
means
of
entreaty
to
persuade
the
ionians
to
break
up
the
passage
to
whom
it
had
been
entrusted
to
guard
the
bridges
of
the
ister
at
that
time
if
histiaios
the
despot
of
miletos
had
followed
the
opinion
of
the
other
despots
and
had
not
made
opposition
to
them
the
power
of
the
persians
would
have
been
brought
to
an
end
yet
it
is
a
fearful
thing
even
to
hear
it
reported
that
the
whole
power
of
the
king
had
come
to
depend
upon
one
human
creature
d
do
not
thou
therefore
propose
to
go
into
any
such
danger
when
there
is
no
need
but
do
as
i
say
at
the
present
time
dissolve
this
assembly
and
afterwards
at
whatever
time
it
shall
seem
good
to
thee
when
thou
hast
considered
prudently
with
thyself
proclaim
that
which
seems
to
thee
best
for
good
counsel
i
hold
to
be
a
very
great
gain
since
even
if
anything
shall
prove
adverse
the
counsel
which
has
been
taken
is
no
less
good
though
it
has
been
defeated
by
fortune
while
he
who
took
counsel
badly
at
first
if
good
fortune
should
go
with
him
has
lighted
on
a
prize
by
chance
but
none
the
less
for
that
his
counsel
was
bad
e
thou
seest
how
god
strikes
with
thunderbolts
the
creatures
which
stand
above
the
rest
and
suffers
them
not
to
make
a
proud
show
while
those
which
are
small
do
not
provoke
him
to
jealousy
thou
seest
also
how
he
hurls
his
darts
ever
at
those
buildings
which
are
the
highest
and
those
trees
likewise
for
god
is
wont
to
cut
short
all
those
things
which
stand
out
above
the
rest
thus
also
a
numerous
army
is
destroyed
by
one
of
few
men
in
some
such
manner
as
this
namely
when
god
having
become
jealous
of
them
casts
upon
them
panic
or
thundering
from
heaven
then
they
are
destroyed
utterly
and
not
as
their
worth
deserves
for
god
suffers
not
any
other
to
have
high
thoughts
save
only
himself
f
moreover
the
hastening
of
any
matter
breeds
disasters
whence
great
losses
are
wont
to
be
produced
but
in
waiting
there
are
many
good
things
contained
as
to
which
if
they
do
not
appear
to
be
good
at
first
yet
one
will
find
them
to
be
so
in
course
of
time
g
to
thee
o
king
i
give
this
counsel
but
thou
son
of
gobryas
mardonios
cease
speaking
foolish
words
about
the
hellenes
since
they
in
no
way
deserve
to
be
spoken
of
with
slight
for
by
uttering
slander
against
the
hellenes
thou
art
stirring
the
king
himself
to
make
an
expedition
and
it
is
to
this
very
end
that
i
think
thou
art
straining
all
thy
endeavour
let
not
this
be
so
for
slander
is
a
most
grievous
thing
in
it
the
wrongdoers
are
two
and
the
person
who
suffers
wrong
is
one
the
slanderer
does
a
wrong
in
that
he
speaks
against
one
who
is
not
present
the
other
in
that
he
is
persuaded
of
the
thing
before
he
gets
certain
knowledge
of
it
and
he
who
is
not
present
when
the
words
are
spoken
suffers
wrong
in
the
matter
thus
both
because
he
has
been
slandered
by
the
one
and
because
he
has
been
believed
to
be
bad
by
the
other
h
however
if
it
be
absolutely
needful
to
make
an
expedition
against
these
men
come
let
the
king
himself
remain
behind
in
the
abodes
of
the
persians
and
let
us
both
set
to
the
wager
our
sons
and
then
do
thou
lead
an
army
by
thyself
choosing
for
thyself
the
men
whom
thou
desirest
and
taking
an
army
as
large
as
thou
thinkest
good
and
if
matters
turn
out
for
the
king
as
thou
sayest
let
my
sons
be
slain
and
let
me
also
be
slain
in
addition
to
them
but
if
in
the
way
which
i
predict
let
thy
sons
suffer
this
and
with
them
thyself
also
if
thou
shalt
return
back
but
if
thou
art
not
willing
to
undergo
this
proof
but
wilt
by
all
means
lead
an
army
against
hellas
then
i
say
that
those
who
are
left
behind
in
this
land
will
hear
that
mardonios
after
having
done
a
great
mischief
to
the
persians
is
torn
by
dogs
and
birds
either
in
the
land
of
the
athenians
or
else
perchance
thou
wilt
be
in
the
land
of
the
lacedemonians
unless
indeed
this
should
have
come
to
pass
even
before
that
upon
the
way
and
that
thou
hast
at
length
been
made
aware
against
what
kind
of
men
thou
art
persuading
the
king
to
march
artabanos
thus
spoke
and
xerxes
enraged
by
it
made
answer
as
follows
artabanos
thou
art
my
father
brother
and
this
shall
save
thee
from
receiving
any
recompense
such
as
thy
foolish
words
deserve
yet
i
attach
to
thee
this
dishonour
seeing
that
thou
art
a
coward
and
spiritless
namely
that
thou
do
not
march
with
me
against
hellas
but
remain
here
together
with
the
women
and
i
even
without
thy
help
will
accomplish
all
the
things
which
i
said
for
i
would
i
might
not
be
descended
from
dareios
the
son
of
hystaspes
the
son
of
arsames
the
son
of
ariaramnes
the
son
of
teïspes
or
from
cyrus
the
son
of
cambyses
the
son
of
teïspes
the
son
of
achaimenes
if
i
take
not
vengeance
on
the
athenians
since
i
know
well
that
if
we
shall
keep
quiet
yet
they
will
not
do
so
but
will
again
march
against
our
land
if
we
may
judge
by
the
deeds
which
have
been
done
by
them
to
begin
with
since
they
both
set
fire
to
sardis
and
marched
upon
asia
it
is
not
possible
therefore
that
either
side
should
retire
from
the
quarrel
but
the
question
before
us
is
whether
we
shall
do
or
whether
we
shall
suffer
whether
all
these
regions
shall
come
to
be
under
the
hellenes
or
all
those
under
the
persians
for
in
our
hostility
there
is
no
middle
course
it
follows
then
now
that
it
is
well
for
us
having
suffered
wrong
first
to
take
revenge
that
i
may
find
out
also
what
is
this
terrible
thing
which
i
shall
suffer
if
i
lead
an
army
against
these
men
men
whom
pelops
the
phrygian
who
was
the
slave
of
my
forefathers
so
subdued
that
even
to
the
present
day
both
the
men
themselves
and
their
land
are
called
after
the
name
of
him
who
subdued
them
thus
far
was
it
spoken
then
but
afterwards
when
darkness
came
on
the
opinion
of
artabanos
tormented
xerxes
continually
and
making
night
his
counsellor
he
found
that
it
was
by
no
means
to
his
advantage
to
make
the
march
against
hellas
so
when
he
had
thus
made
a
new
resolve
he
fell
asleep
and
in
the
night
he
saw
as
is
reported
by
the
persians
a
vision
as
follows
xerxes
thought
that
a
man
tall
and
comely
of
shape
came
and
stood
by
him
and
said
art
thou
indeed
changing
thy
counsel
o
persian
of
leading
an
expedition
against
hellas
now
that
thou
hast
made
proclamation
that
the
persians
shall
collect
an
army
thou
dost
not
well
in
changing
thy
counsel
nor
will
he
who
is
here
present
with
thee
excuse
thee
from
it
but
as
thou
didst
take
counsel
in
the
day
to
do
by
that
way
go
after
he
had
said
this
xerxes
thought
that
he
who
had
spoken
flew
away
and
when
day
had
dawned
he
made
no
account
of
this
dream
but
gathered
together
the
persians
whom
he
had
assembled
also
the
former
time
and
said
to
them
these
words
persians
pardon
me
that
i
make
quick
changes
in
my
counsel
for
in
judgment
not
yet
am
i
come
to
my
prime
and
they
who
advise
me
to
do
the
things
which
i
said
do
not
for
any
long
time
leave
me
to
myself
however
although
at
first
when
i
heard
the
opinion
of
artabanos
my
youthful
impulses
burst
out
so
that
i
cast
out
unseemly
words
against
a
man
older
than
myself
yet
now
i
acknowledge
that
he
is
right
and
i
shall
follow
his
opinion
consider
then
i
have
changed
my
resolve
to
march
against
hellas
and
do
ye
remain
still
the
persians
accordingly
when
they
heard
this
were
rejoiced
and
made
obeisance
but
when
night
had
come
on
the
same
dream
again
came
and
stood
by
xerxes
as
he
lay
asleep
and
said
son
of
dareios
it
is
manifest
then
that
thou
hast
resigned
this
expedition
before
the
assembly
of
the
persians
and
that
thou
hast
made
no
account
of
my
words
as
if
thou
hadst
heard
them
from
no
one
at
all
now
therefore
be
well
assured
of
this
if
thou
do
not
make
thy
march
forthwith
there
shall
thence
spring
up
for
thee
this
result
namely
that
as
thou
didst
in
short
time
become
great
and
mighty
so
also
thou
shalt
speedily
be
again
brought
low
xerxes
then
being
very
greatly
disturbed
by
fear
of
the
vision
started
up
from
his
bed
and
sent
a
messenger
to
summon
artabanos
to
whom
when
he
came
xerxes
spoke
thus
artabanos
at
the
first
i
was
not
discreet
when
i
spoke
to
thee
foolish
words
on
account
of
thy
good
counsel
but
after
no
long
time
i
changed
my
mind
and
perceived
that
i
ought
to
do
these
things
which
thou
didst
suggest
to
me
i
am
not
able
however
to
do
them
although
i
desire
it
for
indeed
now
that
i
have
turned
about
and
changed
my
mind
a
dream
appears
haunting
me
and
by
no
means
approving
that
i
should
do
so
and
just
now
it
has
left
me
even
with
a
threat
if
therefore
it
is
god
who
sends
it
to
me
and
it
is
his
absolute
will
and
pleasure
that
an
army
should
go
against
hellas
this
same
dream
will
fly
to
thee
also
laying
upon
thee
a
charge
such
as
it
has
laid
upon
me
and
it
occurs
to
my
mind
that
this
might
happen
thus
namely
if
thou
shouldst
take
all
my
attire
and
put
it
on
and
then
seat
thyself
on
my
throne
and
after
that
lie
down
to
sleep
in
my
bed
xerxes
spoke
to
him
thus
and
artabanos
was
not
willing
to
obey
the
command
at
first
since
he
did
not
think
himself
worthy
to
sit
upon
the
royal
throne
but
at
last
being
urged
further
he
did
that
which
was
commanded
first
having
spoken
these
words
a
it
is
equally
good
in
my
judgment
o
king
whether
a
man
has
wisdom
himself
or
is
willing
to
follow
the
counsel
of
him
who
speaks
well
and
thou
who
hast
attained
to
both
these
good
things
art
caused
to
err
by
the
communications
of
evil
men
just
as
they
say
that
the
sea
which
is
of
all
things
the
most
useful
to
men
is
by
blasts
of
winds
falling
upon
it
prevented
from
doing
according
to
its
own
nature
i
however
when
i
was
evil
spoken
of
by
thee
was
not
so
much
stung
with
pain
for
this
as
because
when
two
opinions
were
laid
before
the
persians
the
one
tending
to
increase
wanton
insolence
and
the
other
tending
to
check
it
and
saying
that
it
was
a
bad
thing
to
teach
the
soul
to
endeavour
always
to
have
something
more
than
the
present
possession
because
i
say
when
such
opinions
as
these
were
laid
before
us
thou
didst
choose
that
one
which
was
the
more
dangerous
both
for
thyself
and
for
the
persians
b
and
now
that
thou
hast
turned
to
the
better
counsel
thou
sayest
that
when
thou
art
disposed
to
let
go
the
expedition
against
the
hellenes
a
dream
haunts
thee
sent
by
some
god
which
forbids
thee
to
abandon
thy
enterprise
nay
but
here
too
thou
dost
err
my
son
since
this
is
not
of
the
deity
for
the
dreams
of
sleep
which
come
roaming
about
to
men
are
of
such
nature
as
i
shall
inform
thee
being
by
many
years
older
than
thou
the
visions
of
dreams
are
wont
to
hover
above
us
in
such
form
for
the
most
part
as
the
things
of
which
we
were
thinking
during
the
day
and
we
in
the
days
preceding
were
very
much
occupied
with
this
campaign
c
if
however
after
all
this
is
not
such
a
thing
as
i
interpret
it
to
be
but
is
something
which
is
concerned
with
god
thou
hast
summed
the
matter
up
in
that
which
thou
hast
said
let
it
appear
as
thou
sayest
to
me
also
as
to
thee
and
give
commands
but
supposing
that
it
desires
to
appear
to
me
at
all
it
is
not
bound
to
appear
to
me
any
the
more
if
i
have
thy
garments
on
me
than
if
i
have
my
own
nor
any
more
if
i
take
my
rest
in
thy
bed
than
if
i
am
in
thy
own
for
assuredly
this
thing
whatever
it
may
be
which
appears
to
thee
in
thy
sleep
is
not
so
foolish
as
to
suppose
when
it
sees
me
that
it
is
thou
judging
so
because
the
garments
are
thine
that
however
which
we
must
find
out
now
is
this
namely
if
it
will
hold
me
in
no
account
and
not
think
fit
to
appear
to
me
whether
i
have
my
own
garments
or
whether
i
have
thine
but
continue
still
to
haunt
thee
for
if
it
shall
indeed
haunt
thee
perpetually
i
shall
myself
also
be
disposed
to
say
that
it
is
of
the
deity
but
if
thou
hast
resolved
that
it
shall
be
so
and
it
is
not
possible
to
turn
aside
this
thy
resolution
but
i
must
go
to
sleep
in
thy
bed
then
let
it
appear
to
me
also
when
i
perform
these
things
but
until
then
i
shall
hold
to
the
opinion
which
i
now
have
having
thus
said
artabanos
expecting
that
he
would
prove
that
xerxes
was
speaking
folly
did
that
which
was
commanded
him
and
having
put
on
the
garments
of
xerxes
and
seated
himself
in
the
royal
throne
he
afterwards
went
to
bed
and
when
he
had
fallen
asleep
the
same
dream
came
to
him
which
used
to
come
to
xerxes
and
standing
over
artabanos
spoke
these
words
art
thou
indeed
he
who
endeavours
to
dissuade
xerxes
from
making
a
march
against
hellas
pretending
to
have
a
care
of
him
however
neither
in
the
future
nor
now
at
the
present
shalt
thou
escape
unpunished
for
trying
to
turn
away
that
which
is
destined
to
come
to
pass
and
as
for
xerxes
that
which
he
must
suffer
if
he
disobeys
hath
been
shown
already
to
the
man
himself
thus
it
seemed
to
artabanos
that
the
dream
threatened
him
and
at
the
same
time
was
just
about
to
burn
out
his
eyes
with
hot
irons
and
with
a
loud
cry
he
started
up
from
his
bed
and
sitting
down
beside
xerxes
he
related
to
him
throughout
the
vision
of
the
dream
and
then
said
to
him
as
follows
i
o
king
as
one
who
has
seen
before
now
many
great
things
brought
to
their
fall
by
things
less
urged
thee
not
to
yield
in
all
things
to
the
inclination
of
thy
youth
since
i
knew
that
it
was
evil
to
have
desire
after
many
things
remembering
on
the
one
hand
the
march
of
cyrus
against
the
massagetai
what
fortune
it
had
and
also
that
of
cambyses
against
the
ethiopians
and
being
myself
one
who
took
part
with
dareios
in
the
campaign
against
the
scythians
knowing
these
things
i
had
the
opinion
that
thou
wert
to
be
envied
of
all
men
so
long
as
thou
shouldest
keep
still
since
however
there
comes
a
divine
impulse
and
as
it
seems
a
destruction
sent
by
heaven
is
taking
hold
of
the
hellenes
i
for
my
part
am
both
changed
in
myself
and
also
i
reverse
my
opinions
and
do
thou
signify
to
the
persians
the
message
which
is
sent
to
thee
from
god
bidding
them
follow
the
commands
which
were
given
by
thee
at
first
with
regard
to
the
preparations
to
be
made
and
endeavour
that
on
thy
side
nothing
may
be
wanting
since
god
delivers
the
matter
into
thy
hands
these
things
having
been
said
both
were
excited
to
confidence
by
the
vision
and
so
soon
as
it
became
day
xerxes
communicated
the
matter
to
the
persians
and
artabanos
who
before
was
the
only
man
who
came
forward
to
dissuade
him
now
came
forward
to
urge
on
the
design
xerxes
being
thus
desirous
to
make
the
expedition
there
came
to
him
after
this
a
third
vision
in
his
sleep
which
the
magians
when
they
heard
it
explained
to
have
reference
to
the
dominion
of
the
whole
earth
and
to
mean
that
all
men
should
be
subject
to
him
and
the
vision
was
this
xerxes
thought
that
he
had
been
crowned
with
a
wreath
of
an
and
that
the
shoots
growing
from
the
covered
the
whole
earth
and
after
that
the
wreath
placed
as
it
was
about
his
head
disappeared
when
the
magians
had
thus
interpreted
the
vision
forthwith
every
man
of
the
persians
who
had
been
assembled
together
departed
to
his
own
province
and
was
zealous
by
all
means
to
perform
the
commands
desiring
each
one
to
receive
for
himself
the
gifts
which
had
been
proposed
and
thus
xerxes
was
gathering
his
army
together
searching
every
region
of
the
continent
during
four
full
years
from
the
conquest
of
egypt
he
was
preparing
the
army
and
the
things
that
were
of
service
for
the
army
and
in
the
course
of
the
fifth
year
he
began
his
campaign
with
a
host
of
great
multitude
for
of
all
the
armies
of
which
we
have
knowledge
this
proved
to
be
by
far
the
greatest
so
that
neither
that
led
by
dareios
against
the
scythians
appears
anything
as
compared
with
it
nor
the
scythian
host
when
the
scythians
pursuing
the
kimmerians
made
invasion
of
the
median
land
and
subdued
and
occupied
nearly
all
the
upper
parts
of
asia
for
which
invasion
afterwards
dareios
attempted
to
take
vengeance
nor
that
led
by
the
sons
of
atreus
to
ilion
to
judge
by
that
which
is
reported
of
their
expedition
nor
that
of
the
mysians
and
teucrians
before
the
trojan
war
who
passed
over
into
europe
by
the
bosphorus
and
not
only
subdued
all
the
thracians
but
came
down
also
as
far
as
the
ionian
sea
and
marched
southwards
to
the
river
peneios
all
these
expeditions
put
together
with
others
if
there
be
any
added
to
them
are
not
equal
to
this
one
alone
for
what
nation
did
xerxes
not
lead
out
of
asia
against
hellas
and
what
water
was
not
exhausted
being
drunk
by
his
host
except
only
the
great
rivers
for
some
supplied
ships
and
others
were
appointed
to
serve
in
the
to
some
it
was
appointed
to
furnish
cavalry
and
to
others
vessels
to
carry
horses
while
they
served
in
the
expedition
themselves
also
others
were
ordered
to
furnish
ships
of
war
for
the
bridges
and
others
again
ships
with
provisions
then
in
the
first
place
since
the
former
fleet
had
suffered
disaster
in
sailing
round
athos
preparations
had
been
going
on
for
about
three
years
past
with
regard
to
athos
for
triremes
lay
at
anchor
at
elaius
in
the
chersonese
and
with
this
for
their
starting
point
men
of
all
nations
belonging
to
the
army
worked
at
digging
compelled
by
the
lash
and
the
men
went
to
the
work
regularly
in
succession
moreover
those
who
dwelt
round
about
athos
worked
also
at
the
digging
and
bubares
the
son
of
megabazos
and
artachaies
the
son
of
artaios
persians
both
were
set
over
the
work
now
athos
is
a
mountain
great
and
famous
running
down
to
the
sea
and
inhabited
by
men
and
where
the
mountain
ends
on
the
side
of
the
mainland
the
place
is
like
a
peninsula
with
an
isthmus
about
twelve
furlongs
across
here
it
is
plain
land
or
hills
of
no
great
size
extending
from
the
sea
of
the
acanthians
to
that
which
lies
off
torone
and
on
this
isthmus
where
athos
ends
is
situated
a
hellenic
city
called
sane
moreover
there
are
others
beyond
sane
and
within
the
peninsula
of
athos
all
which
at
this
time
the
persian
had
resolved
to
make
into
cities
of
an
island
and
no
longer
of
the
mainland
these
are
dion
olophyxos
acrothoon
thyssos
cleonai
these
are
the
cities
which
occupy
athos
and
they
dug
as
follows
the
country
being
divided
among
the
barbarians
by
nations
for
the
work
at
the
city
of
sane
they
drew
a
straight
line
across
the
isthmus
and
when
the
channel
became
deep
those
who
stood
lowest
dug
while
others
delivered
the
earth
as
it
was
dug
out
to
other
men
who
stood
above
as
upon
steps
and
they
again
to
others
when
it
was
received
until
they
came
to
those
that
were
highest
and
these
bore
it
away
and
cast
it
forth
now
the
others
except
the
phenicians
had
double
toil
by
the
breaking
down
of
the
steep
edges
of
their
excavation
for
since
they
endeavoured
to
make
the
opening
at
the
top
and
that
at
the
bottom
both
of
the
same
measure
some
such
thing
was
likely
to
result
as
they
worked
but
the
phenicians
who
are
apt
to
show
ability
in
their
works
generally
did
so
in
this
work
also
for
when
they
had
had
assigned
to
them
by
lot
so
much
as
fell
to
their
share
they
proceeded
to
dig
making
the
opening
of
the
excavation
at
the
top
twice
as
wide
as
the
channel
itself
was
to
be
and
as
the
work
went
forward
they
kept
contracting
the
width
so
that
when
they
came
to
the
bottom
their
work
was
made
of
equal
width
with
that
of
the
others
now
there
is
a
meadow
there
in
which
there
was
made
for
them
a
market
and
a
place
for
buying
and
selling
and
great
quantities
of
corn
came
for
them
regularly
from
asia
ready
ground
it
seems
to
me
making
conjecture
of
this
work
that
xerxes
when
he
ordered
this
to
be
dug
was
moved
by
a
love
of
magnificence
and
by
a
desire
to
make
a
display
of
his
power
and
to
leave
a
memorial
behind
him
for
though
they
might
have
drawn
the
ships
across
the
isthmus
with
no
great
labour
he
bade
them
dig
a
channel
for
the
sea
of
such
breadth
that
two
triremes
might
sail
through
propelled
side
by
side
to
these
same
men
to
whom
the
digging
had
been
appointed
it
was
appointed
also
to
make
a
bridge
over
the
river
strymon
yoking
together
the
banks
these
things
were
being
done
by
xerxes
thus
and
meanwhile
he
caused
ropes
also
to
be
prepared
for
the
bridges
made
of
papyrus
and
of
white
flax
appointing
this
to
the
phenicians
and
egyptians
and
also
he
was
making
preparations
to
store
provisions
for
his
army
on
the
way
that
neither
the
army
itself
nor
the
baggage
animals
might
suffer
from
scarcity
as
they
made
their
march
against
hellas
accordingly
when
he
had
learnt
by
inquiry
of
the
various
places
he
bade
them
make
stores
where
it
was
most
convenient
carrying
supplies
to
different
parts
by
merchant
ships
and
from
all
the
countries
of
asia
so
they
conveyed
the
greater
part
of
the
corn
to
the
place
which
is
called
leuke
acte
in
thrace
while
others
conveyed
stores
to
tyrodiza
of
the
perinthians
others
to
doriscos
others
to
eïon
on
the
strymon
and
others
to
macedonia
the
work
being
distributed
between
them
during
the
time
that
these
were
working
at
the
task
which
had
been
proposed
to
them
the
whole
had
been
assembled
together
and
was
marching
with
xerxes
to
sardis
setting
forth
from
critalla
in
cappadokia
for
there
it
had
been
ordered
that
the
whole
army
should
assemble
which
was
to
go
with
xerxes
himself
by
the
land
but
which
of
the
governors
of
provinces
brought
the
best
equipped
force
and
received
from
the
king
the
gifts
proposed
i
am
not
able
to
say
for
i
do
not
know
that
they
even
came
to
a
competition
in
this
matter
then
after
they
had
crossed
the
river
halys
and
had
entered
phrygia
marching
through
this
land
they
came
to
kelainai
where
the
springs
of
the
river
maiander
come
up
and
also
those
of
another
river
not
less
than
the
maiander
whose
name
is
catarractes
this
rises
in
the
itself
of
kelainai
and
runs
into
the
maiander
and
here
also
is
hanging
up
in
the
city
the
skin
of
marsyas
the
silenos
which
is
said
by
the
phrygians
to
have
been
flayed
off
and
hung
up
by
apollo
in
this
city
pythios
the
son
of
atys
a
lydian
was
waiting
for
the
king
and
entertained
his
whole
army
as
well
as
xerxes
himself
with
the
most
magnificent
hospitality
moreover
he
professed
himself
ready
to
supply
money
for
the
war
so
when
pythios
offered
money
xerxes
asked
those
of
the
persians
who
were
present
who
pythios
was
and
how
much
money
he
possessed
that
he
made
this
offer
they
said
o
king
this
is
he
who
presented
thy
father
dareios
with
the
golden
and
the
golden
vine
and
even
now
he
is
in
wealth
the
first
of
all
men
of
whom
we
know
excepting
thee
only
marvelling
at
the
conclusion
of
these
words
xerxes
himself
asked
of
pythios
then
how
much
money
he
had
and
he
said
o
king
i
will
not
conceal
the
truth
from
thee
nor
will
i
allege
as
an
excuse
that
i
do
not
know
my
own
substance
but
i
will
enumerate
it
to
thee
exactly
since
i
know
the
truth
for
as
soon
as
i
heard
that
thou
wert
coming
down
to
the
sea
of
hellas
desiring
to
give
thee
money
for
the
war
i
ascertained
the
truth
and
calculating
i
found
that
i
had
of
silver
two
thousand
talents
and
of
gold
four
hundred
myriads
of
daric
staters
all
but
seven
thousand
and
with
this
money
i
present
thee
for
myself
i
have
sufficient
livelihood
from
my
slaves
and
from
my
estates
of
land
thus
he
said
and
xerxes
was
pleased
by
the
things
which
he
had
spoken
and
replied
lydian
host
ever
since
i
went
forth
from
the
persian
land
i
have
encountered
no
man
up
to
this
time
who
was
desirous
to
entertain
my
army
or
who
came
into
my
presence
and
made
offer
of
his
own
free
will
to
contribute
money
to
me
for
the
war
except
only
thee
and
thou
not
only
didst
entertain
my
army
magnificently
but
also
now
dost
make
offer
of
great
sums
of
money
to
thee
therefore
in
return
i
give
these
rewards
i
make
thee
my
and
i
will
complete
for
thee
the
four
hundred
myriads
of
staters
by
giving
from
myself
the
seven
thousand
in
order
that
thy
four
hundred
myriads
may
not
fall
short
by
seven
thousand
but
thou
mayest
have
a
full
sum
in
thy
reckoning
completed
thus
by
me
keep
possession
of
that
which
thou
hast
got
for
thyself
and
be
sure
to
act
always
thus
for
if
thou
doest
so
thou
wilt
have
no
cause
to
repent
either
at
the
time
or
afterwards
having
thus
said
and
having
accomplished
his
promise
he
continued
his
march
onwards
and
passing
by
a
city
of
the
phrygians
called
anaua
and
a
lake
whence
salt
is
obtained
he
came
to
colossai
a
great
city
of
phrygia
where
the
river
lycos
falls
into
an
opening
of
the
earth
and
disappears
from
view
and
then
after
an
interval
of
about
five
furlongs
it
comes
up
to
view
again
and
this
river
also
flows
into
the
maiander
setting
forth
from
colossai
towards
the
boundaries
of
the
phrygians
and
lydians
the
army
arrived
at
the
city
of
kydrara
where
a
pillar
is
fixed
set
up
by
croesus
which
declares
by
an
inscription
that
the
boundaries
are
there
from
phrygia
then
he
entered
lydia
and
here
the
road
parts
into
two
and
that
which
goes
to
the
left
leads
towards
caria
while
that
which
goes
to
the
right
leads
to
sardis
and
travelling
by
this
latter
road
one
must
needs
cross
the
river
maiander
and
pass
by
the
city
of
callatebos
where
men
live
whose
trade
it
is
to
make
honey
of
the
and
of
by
this
road
went
xerxes
and
found
a
to
which
for
its
beauty
he
gave
an
adornment
of
gold
and
appointed
that
some
one
should
have
charge
of
it
always
in
undying
succession
and
on
the
next
day
he
came
to
the
city
of
the
lydians
having
come
to
sardis
he
proceeded
first
to
send
heralds
to
hellas
to
ask
for
earth
and
water
and
also
to
give
notice
beforehand
to
prepare
meals
for
the
king
except
that
he
sent
neither
to
athens
nor
lacedemon
to
ask
for
earth
but
to
all
the
other
states
and
the
reason
why
he
sent
the
second
time
to
ask
for
earth
and
water
was
this
as
many
as
had
not
given
at
the
former
time
to
dareios
when
he
sent
these
he
thought
would
certainly
give
now
by
reason
of
their
fear
this
matter
it
was
about
which
he
desired
to
have
certain
knowledge
and
he
sent
accordingly
after
this
he
made
his
preparations
intending
to
march
to
abydos
and
meanwhile
they
were
bridging
over
the
hellespont
from
asia
to
europe
now
there
is
in
the
chersonese
of
the
hellespont
between
the
city
of
sestos
and
madytos
a
broad
foreland
running
down
into
the
sea
right
opposite
abydos
this
is
the
place
where
no
long
time
afterwards
the
athenians
under
the
command
of
xanthippos
the
son
of
ariphron
having
taken
artaÿctes
a
persian
who
was
the
governor
of
sestos
nailed
him
alive
to
a
board
with
hands
and
feet
extended
he
was
the
man
who
was
wont
to
take
women
with
him
to
the
temple
of
protesilaos
at
elaius
and
to
do
things
there
which
are
not
lawful
to
this
foreland
they
on
whom
this
work
was
laid
were
making
their
bridges
starting
from
abydos
the
phenicians
constructing
the
one
with
ropes
of
white
flax
and
the
egyptians
the
other
which
was
made
with
papyrus
rope
now
from
abydos
to
the
opposite
shore
is
a
distance
of
seven
furlongs
but
when
the
strait
had
been
bridged
over
a
great
storm
came
on
and
dashed
together
all
the
work
that
had
been
made
and
broke
it
up
then
when
xerxes
heard
it
he
was
exceedingly
enraged
and
bade
them
scourge
the
hellespont
with
three
hundred
strokes
of
the
lash
and
let
down
into
the
sea
a
pair
of
fetters
nay
i
have
heard
further
that
he
sent
branders
also
with
them
to
brand
the
hellespont
however
this
may
be
he
enjoined
them
as
they
were
beating
to
say
barbarian
and
presumptuous
words
as
follows
thou
bitter
water
thy
master
lays
upon
thee
this
penalty
because
thou
didst
wrong
him
not
having
suffered
any
wrong
from
him
and
xerxes
the
king
will
pass
over
thee
whether
thou
be
willing
or
no
but
with
right
as
it
seems
no
man
doeth
sacrifice
to
thee
seeing
that
thou
art
a
treacherous
and
briny
stream
the
sea
he
enjoined
them
to
chastise
thus
and
also
he
bade
them
cut
off
the
heads
of
those
who
were
appointed
to
have
charge
over
the
bridging
of
the
hellespont
thus
then
the
men
did
to
whom
this
ungracious
office
belonged
and
meanwhile
other
proceeded
to
make
the
bridges
and
thus
they
made
them
they
put
together
galleys
and
triremes
three
hundred
and
sixty
to
be
under
the
bridge
towards
the
euxine
sea
and
three
hundred
and
fourteen
to
be
under
the
other
the
vessels
lying
in
the
direction
of
the
stream
of
the
hellespont
though
crosswise
in
respect
to
the
pontus
to
support
the
tension
of
the
ropes
they
placed
them
together
thus
and
let
down
very
large
anchors
those
on
the
one
side
towards
the
pontus
because
of
the
winds
which
blow
from
within
outwards
and
on
the
other
side
towards
the
west
and
the
egean
because
of
the
and
south
winds
they
left
also
an
opening
for
a
passage
through
so
that
any
who
wished
might
be
able
to
sail
into
the
pontus
with
small
vessels
and
also
from
the
pontus
outwards
having
thus
done
they
proceeded
to
stretch
tight
the
ropes
straining
them
with
wooden
windlasses
not
now
appointing
the
two
kinds
of
rope
to
be
used
apart
from
one
another
but
assigning
to
each
bridge
two
ropes
of
white
flax
and
four
of
the
papyrus
ropes
the
thickness
and
beauty
of
make
was
the
same
for
both
but
the
flaxen
ropes
were
heavier
in
proportion
and
of
this
rope
a
cubit
weighed
one
talent
when
the
passage
was
bridged
over
they
sawed
up
logs
of
wood
and
making
them
equal
in
length
to
the
breadth
of
the
bridge
they
laid
them
above
the
stretched
ropes
and
having
set
them
thus
in
order
they
again
fastened
them
above
when
this
was
done
they
carried
on
brushwood
and
having
set
the
brushwood
also
in
place
they
carried
on
to
it
earth
and
when
they
had
stamped
down
the
earth
firmly
they
built
a
barrier
along
on
each
side
so
that
the
and
horses
might
not
be
frightened
by
looking
out
over
the
sea
when
the
construction
of
the
bridges
had
been
finished
and
the
works
about
athos
both
the
embankments
about
the
mouths
of
the
channel
which
were
made
because
of
the
breaking
of
the
sea
upon
the
beach
that
the
mouths
of
it
might
not
be
filled
up
and
the
channel
itself
were
reported
to
be
fully
completed
then
after
they
had
passed
the
winter
at
sardis
the
army
set
forth
from
thence
fully
equipped
at
the
beginning
of
spring
to
march
to
abydos
and
when
it
had
just
set
forth
the
sun
left
his
place
in
the
heaven
and
was
invisible
though
there
was
no
gathering
of
clouds
and
the
sky
was
perfectly
clear
and
instead
of
day
it
became
night
when
xerxes
saw
and
perceived
this
it
became
a
matter
of
concern
to
him
and
he
asked
the
magians
what
the
appearance
meant
to
portend
these
declared
that
the
god
was
foreshowing
to
the
hellenes
a
leaving
of
their
cities
saying
that
the
sun
was
the
foreshower
of
events
for
the
hellenes
but
the
moon
for
the
persians
having
been
thus
informed
xerxes
proceeded
on
the
march
with
very
great
joy
then
as
he
was
leading
forth
his
army
on
its
march
pythios
the
lydian
being
alarmed
by
the
appearance
in
the
heavens
and
elated
by
the
gifts
which
he
had
received
came
to
xerxes
and
said
as
follows
master
i
would
desire
to
receive
from
thee
a
certain
thing
at
my
request
which
as
it
chances
is
for
thee
an
easy
thing
to
grant
but
a
great
thing
for
me
if
i
obtain
it
then
xerxes
thinking
that
his
request
would
be
for
anything
rather
than
that
which
he
actually
asked
said
that
he
would
grant
it
and
bade
him
speak
and
say
what
he
desired
he
then
when
he
heard
this
was
encouraged
and
spoke
these
words
master
i
have
as
it
chances
five
sons
and
it
is
their
fortune
to
be
all
going
together
with
thee
on
the
march
against
hellas
do
thou
therefore
o
king
have
compassion
upon
me
who
have
come
to
so
great
an
age
and
release
from
serving
in
the
expedition
one
of
my
sons
the
eldest
in
order
that
he
may
be
caretaker
both
of
myself
and
of
my
wealth
but
the
other
four
take
with
thyself
and
after
thou
hast
accomplished
that
which
thou
hast
in
thy
mind
mayest
thou
have
a
safe
return
home
then
xerxes
was
exceedingly
angry
and
made
answer
with
these
words
thou
wretched
man
dost
thou
dare
when
i
am
going
on
a
march
myself
against
hellas
and
am
taking
my
sons
and
my
brothers
and
my
relations
and
friends
dost
thou
dare
to
make
any
mention
of
a
son
of
thine
seeing
that
thou
art
my
slave
who
ought
to
have
been
accompanying
me
thyself
with
thy
whole
household
and
thy
wife
as
well
now
therefore
be
assured
of
this
that
the
passionate
spirit
of
man
dwells
within
the
ears
and
when
it
has
heard
good
things
it
fills
the
body
with
delight
but
when
it
has
heard
the
opposite
things
to
this
it
swells
up
with
anger
as
then
thou
canst
not
boast
of
having
surpassed
the
king
in
conferring
benefits
formerly
when
thou
didst
to
us
good
deeds
and
madest
offer
to
do
more
of
the
same
kind
so
now
that
thou
hast
turned
to
shamelessness
thou
shalt
receive
not
thy
desert
but
less
than
thou
deservest
for
thy
gifts
of
hospitality
shall
rescue
from
death
thyself
and
the
four
others
of
thy
sons
but
thou
shalt
pay
the
penalty
with
the
life
of
the
one
to
whom
thou
dost
cling
most
having
answered
thus
he
forthwith
commanded
those
to
whom
it
was
appointed
to
do
these
things
to
find
out
the
eldest
of
the
sons
of
pythios
and
to
cut
him
in
two
in
the
middle
and
having
cut
him
in
two
to
dispose
the
halves
one
on
the
right
hand
of
the
road
and
the
other
on
the
left
and
that
the
army
should
pass
between
them
by
this
way
when
these
had
so
done
the
army
proceeded
to
pass
between
and
first
the
led
the
way
together
with
their
horses
and
after
these
the
host
composed
of
all
kinds
of
nations
mingled
together
without
distinction
and
when
more
than
the
half
had
gone
by
an
interval
was
left
and
these
were
separated
from
the
king
for
before
him
went
first
a
thousand
horsemen
chosen
out
of
all
the
persians
and
after
them
a
thousand
spearmen
chosen
also
from
all
the
persians
having
the
points
of
their
spears
turned
down
to
the
ground
and
then
ten
sacred
horses
called
nesaian
with
the
fairest
possible
trappings
now
the
horses
are
called
nesaian
for
this
reason
there
is
a
wide
plain
in
the
land
of
media
which
is
called
the
nesaian
plain
and
this
plain
produces
the
great
horses
of
which
i
speak
behind
these
ten
horses
the
sacred
chariot
of
zeus
was
appointed
to
go
which
was
drawn
by
eight
white
horses
and
behind
the
horses
again
followed
on
foot
a
charioteer
holding
the
reins
for
no
human
creature
mounts
upon
the
seat
of
that
chariot
then
behind
this
came
xerxes
himself
in
a
chariot
drawn
by
nesaian
horses
and
by
the
side
of
him
rode
a
charioteer
whose
name
was
patiramphes
son
of
otanes
a
persian
thus
did
xerxes
march
forth
out
of
sardis
and
he
used
to
change
whenever
he
was
so
disposed
from
the
chariot
to
a
carriage
and
behind
him
went
spearmen
the
best
and
most
noble
of
the
persians
a
thousand
in
number
holding
their
in
the
customary
way
and
after
them
another
thousand
horsemen
chosen
out
from
the
persians
and
after
the
horsemen
ten
thousand
men
chosen
out
from
the
remainder
of
the
persians
this
body
went
on
foot
and
of
these
a
thousand
had
upon
their
spears
pomegranates
of
gold
instead
of
the
spikes
at
the
and
these
enclosed
the
others
round
while
the
remaining
nine
thousand
were
within
these
and
had
silver
pomegranates
and
those
also
had
golden
pomegranates
who
had
their
turned
towards
the
earth
while
those
who
followed
next
after
xerxes
had
golden
apples
then
to
follow
the
ten
thousand
there
was
appointed
a
body
of
ten
thousand
persian
cavalry
and
after
the
cavalry
there
was
an
interval
of
as
much
as
two
furlongs
then
the
rest
of
the
host
came
marching
without
distinction
so
the
army
proceeded
on
its
march
from
lydia
to
the
river
caïcos
and
the
land
of
mysia
and
then
setting
forth
from
the
caïcos
and
keeping
the
mountain
of
cane
on
the
left
hand
it
marched
through
the
region
of
atarneus
to
the
city
of
carene
from
this
it
went
through
the
plain
of
thebe
passing
by
the
cities
of
adramytteion
and
antandros
of
the
pelasgians
and
taking
mount
ida
on
the
left
hand
it
came
on
to
the
land
of
ilion
and
first
when
it
had
stopped
for
the
night
close
under
mount
ida
thunder
and
bolts
of
lightning
fell
upon
it
and
destroyed
here
in
this
place
a
very
large
number
of
men
then
when
the
army
had
come
to
the
river
scamander
which
of
all
rivers
to
which
they
had
come
since
they
set
forth
from
sardis
and
undertook
their
march
was
the
first
of
which
the
stream
failed
and
was
not
sufficient
for
the
drinking
of
the
army
and
of
the
animals
with
it
when
i
say
xerxes
had
come
to
this
river
he
went
up
to
the
citadel
of
priam
having
a
desire
to
see
it
and
having
seen
it
and
learnt
by
inquiry
of
all
those
matters
severally
he
sacrificed
a
thousand
heifers
to
athene
of
ilion
and
the
magians
poured
libations
in
honour
of
the
heroes
and
after
they
had
done
this
a
fear
fell
upon
the
army
in
the
night
then
at
break
of
day
he
set
forth
from
thence
keeping
on
his
left
hand
the
cities
of
rhoition
and
ophryneion
and
dardanos
which
last
borders
upon
abydos
and
having
on
the
right
hand
the
gergith
teucrians
when
xerxes
had
come
into
the
midst
of
abydos
he
had
a
desire
to
see
all
the
army
and
there
had
been
made
purposely
for
him
beforehand
upon
a
hill
in
this
place
a
raised
seat
of
white
stone
which
the
people
of
abydos
had
built
at
the
command
of
the
king
given
beforehand
there
he
took
his
seat
and
looking
down
upon
the
shore
he
gazed
both
upon
the
and
the
ships
and
gazing
upon
them
he
had
a
longing
to
see
a
contest
take
place
between
the
ships
and
when
it
had
taken
place
and
the
phenicians
of
sidon
were
victorious
he
was
delighted
both
with
the
contest
and
with
the
whole
armament
and
seeing
all
the
hellespont
covered
over
with
the
ships
and
all
the
shores
and
the
plains
of
abydos
full
of
men
then
xerxes
pronounced
himself
a
happy
man
and
after
that
he
fell
to
weeping
artabanos
his
uncle
therefore
perceiving
him
the
same
who
at
first
boldly
declared
his
opinion
advising
xerxes
not
to
march
against
hellas
this
man
i
say
having
observed
that
xerxes
wept
asked
as
follows
o
king
how
far
different
from
one
another
are
the
things
which
thou
hast
done
now
and
a
short
while
before
now
for
having
pronounced
thyself
a
happy
man
thou
art
now
shedding
tears
he
said
yea
for
after
i
had
reckoned
up
it
came
into
my
mind
to
feel
pity
at
the
thought
how
brief
was
the
whole
life
of
man
seeing
that
of
these
multitudes
not
one
will
be
alive
when
a
hundred
years
have
gone
by
he
then
made
answer
and
said
to
another
evil
more
pitiful
than
this
we
are
made
subject
in
the
course
of
our
life
for
in
the
period
of
life
short
as
it
is
no
man
either
of
these
here
or
of
others
is
made
by
nature
so
happy
that
there
will
not
come
to
him
many
times
and
not
once
only
the
desire
to
be
dead
rather
than
to
live
for
misfortunes
falling
upon
us
and
diseases
disturbing
our
happiness
make
the
time
of
life
though
short
indeed
seem
long
thus
since
life
is
full
of
trouble
death
has
become
the
most
acceptable
refuge
for
man
and
god
having
given
him
to
taste
of
the
sweetness
of
life
is
discovered
in
this
matter
to
be
full
of
jealousy
xerxes
made
answer
saying
artabanos
of
human
life
which
is
such
as
thou
dost
define
it
to
be
let
us
cease
to
speak
and
do
not
remember
evils
when
we
have
good
things
in
hand
but
do
thou
declare
to
me
this
if
the
vision
of
the
dream
had
not
appeared
with
so
much
evidence
wouldest
thou
still
be
holding
thy
former
opinion
endeavouring
to
prevent
me
from
marching
against
hellas
or
wouldest
thou
have
changed
from
it
come
tell
me
this
exactly
he
answered
saying
o
king
may
the
vision
of
the
dream
which
appeared
have
such
fulfilment
as
we
both
desire
but
i
am
even
to
this
moment
full
of
apprehension
and
can
not
contain
myself
taking
into
account
many
things
besides
and
also
seeing
that
two
things
which
are
the
greatest
things
of
all
are
utterly
hostile
to
thee
to
this
xerxes
made
answer
in
these
words
thou
strangest
of
men
of
what
nature
are
these
two
things
which
thou
sayest
are
utterly
hostile
to
me
is
it
that
the
is
to
be
found
fault
with
in
the
matter
of
numbers
and
that
the
army
of
the
hellenes
appears
to
thee
likely
to
be
many
times
as
large
as
ours
or
dost
thou
think
that
our
fleet
will
fall
short
of
theirs
or
even
that
both
of
these
things
together
will
prove
true
for
if
thou
thinkest
that
in
these
respects
our
power
is
deficient
one
might
make
gathering
at
once
of
another
force
then
he
made
answer
and
said
o
king
neither
with
this
army
would
any
one
who
has
understanding
find
fault
nor
with
the
number
of
the
ships
and
indeed
if
thou
shalt
assemble
more
the
two
things
of
which
i
speak
will
be
made
thereby
yet
more
hostile
and
these
two
things
are
the
land
and
the
sea
for
neither
in
the
sea
is
there
as
i
suppose
a
harbour
anywhere
large
enough
to
receive
this
fleet
of
thine
if
a
storm
should
arise
and
to
ensure
the
safety
of
the
ships
till
it
be
over
and
yet
not
one
alone
ought
this
harbour
to
be
but
there
should
be
such
harbours
along
the
whole
coast
of
the
continent
by
which
thou
sailest
and
if
there
are
not
harbours
to
receive
thy
ships
know
that
accidents
will
rule
men
and
not
men
the
accidents
now
having
told
thee
of
one
of
the
two
things
i
am
about
to
tell
thee
of
the
other
the
land
i
say
becomes
hostile
to
thee
in
this
way
if
nothing
shall
come
to
oppose
thee
the
land
is
hostile
to
thee
by
so
much
the
more
in
proportion
as
thou
shalt
advance
more
ever
stealing
on
further
and
further
for
there
is
no
satiety
of
good
fortune
felt
by
men
and
this
i
say
that
with
no
one
to
stand
against
thee
the
country
traversed
growing
more
and
more
as
time
goes
on
will
produce
for
thee
famine
man
however
will
be
in
the
best
condition
if
when
he
is
taking
counsel
he
feels
fear
reckoning
to
suffer
everything
that
can
possibly
come
but
in
doing
the
deed
he
is
bold
xerxes
made
answer
in
these
words
artabanos
reasonably
dost
thou
set
forth
these
matters
but
do
not
thou
fear
everything
nor
reckon
equally
for
everything
for
if
thou
shouldest
set
thyself
with
regard
to
all
matters
which
come
on
at
any
time
to
reckon
for
everything
equally
thou
wouldest
never
perform
any
deed
it
is
better
to
have
good
courage
about
everything
and
to
suffer
half
the
evils
which
threaten
than
to
have
fear
beforehand
about
everything
and
not
to
suffer
any
evil
at
all
and
if
while
contending
against
everything
which
is
said
thou
omit
to
declare
the
course
which
is
safe
thou
dost
incur
in
these
matters
the
reproach
of
failure
equally
with
him
who
says
the
opposite
to
this
this
then
i
say
is
evenly
balanced
but
how
should
one
who
is
but
man
know
the
course
which
is
safe
i
think
in
no
way
to
those
then
who
choose
to
act
for
the
most
part
gain
is
wont
to
come
but
to
those
who
reckon
for
everything
and
shrink
back
it
is
not
much
wont
to
come
thou
seest
the
power
of
the
persians
to
what
great
might
it
has
advanced
if
then
those
who
came
to
be
kings
before
me
had
had
opinions
like
to
thine
or
though
not
having
such
opinions
had
had
such
counsellors
as
thou
thou
wouldest
never
have
seen
it
brought
forward
to
this
point
as
it
is
however
by
running
risks
they
conducted
it
on
to
this
for
great
power
is
in
general
gained
by
running
great
risks
we
therefore
following
their
example
are
making
our
march
now
during
the
fairest
season
of
the
year
and
after
we
have
subdued
all
europe
we
shall
return
back
home
neither
having
met
with
famine
anywhere
nor
having
suffered
any
other
thing
which
is
unpleasant
for
first
we
march
bearing
with
us
ourselves
great
store
of
food
and
secondly
we
shall
possess
the
of
all
the
peoples
to
whose
land
and
nation
we
come
and
we
are
making
a
march
now
against
men
who
plough
the
soil
and
not
against
nomad
tribes
after
this
artabanos
said
o
king
since
thou
dost
urge
us
not
to
have
fear
of
anything
do
thou
i
pray
thee
accept
a
counsel
from
me
for
when
speaking
of
many
things
it
is
necessary
to
extend
speech
to
a
greater
length
cyrus
the
son
of
cambyses
subdued
all
ionia
except
the
athenians
so
that
it
was
tributary
to
the
persians
these
men
therefore
i
counsel
thee
by
no
means
to
lead
against
their
parent
stock
seeing
that
even
without
these
we
are
able
to
get
the
advantage
over
our
enemies
for
supposing
that
they
go
with
us
either
they
must
prove
themselves
doers
of
great
wrong
if
they
join
in
reducing
their
mother
city
to
slavery
or
doers
of
great
right
if
they
join
in
freeing
her
now
if
they
show
themselves
doers
of
great
wrong
they
bring
us
no
very
large
gain
in
addition
but
if
they
show
themselves
doers
of
great
right
they
are
able
then
to
cause
much
damage
to
thy
army
therefore
lay
to
heart
also
the
ancient
saying
how
well
it
has
been
said
that
at
the
first
beginning
of
things
the
end
does
not
completely
appear
to
this
xerxes
made
answer
artabanos
of
all
the
opinions
which
thou
hast
uttered
thou
art
mistaken
most
of
all
in
this
seeing
that
thou
fearest
lest
the
ionians
should
change
side
about
whom
we
have
a
most
sure
proof
of
which
thou
art
a
witness
thyself
and
also
the
rest
are
witnesses
who
went
with
dareios
on
his
march
against
the
scythians
namely
this
that
the
whole
persian
army
then
came
to
be
dependent
upon
these
men
whether
they
would
destroy
or
whether
they
would
save
it
and
they
displayed
righteous
dealing
and
trustworthiness
and
nought
at
all
that
was
unfriendly
besides
this
seeing
that
they
have
left
children
and
wives
and
wealth
in
our
land
we
must
not
even
imagine
that
they
will
make
any
rebellion
fear
not
then
this
thing
either
but
have
a
good
heart
and
keep
safe
my
house
and
my
government
for
to
thee
of
all
men
i
entrust
my
sceptre
of
rule
having
thus
spoken
and
having
sent
artabanos
back
to
susa
next
xerxes
summoned
to
his
presence
the
men
of
most
repute
among
the
persians
and
when
they
were
come
before
him
he
spoke
to
them
as
follows
persians
i
assembled
you
together
desiring
this
of
you
that
ye
should
show
yourselves
good
men
and
should
not
disgrace
the
deeds
done
in
former
times
by
the
persians
which
are
great
and
glorious
but
let
us
each
one
of
us
by
himself
and
all
together
also
be
zealous
in
our
enterprise
for
this
which
we
labour
for
is
a
common
good
for
all
and
i
exhort
you
that
ye
preserve
in
the
war
without
relaxing
your
efforts
because
as
i
am
informed
we
are
marching
against
good
men
and
if
we
shall
overcome
them
there
will
not
be
any
other
army
of
men
which
will
ever
stand
against
us
now
therefore
let
us
begin
the
crossing
after
having
made
prayer
to
those
gods
who
have
the
persians
for
their
allotted
charge
during
this
day
then
they
were
making
preparation
to
cross
over
and
on
the
next
day
they
waited
for
the
sun
desiring
to
see
him
rise
and
in
the
meantime
they
offered
all
kinds
of
incense
upon
the
bridges
and
strewed
the
way
with
branches
of
myrtle
then
as
the
sun
was
rising
xerxes
made
libation
from
a
golden
cup
into
the
sea
and
prayed
to
the
sun
that
no
accident
might
befall
him
such
as
should
cause
him
to
cease
from
subduing
europe
until
he
had
come
to
its
furthest
limits
after
having
thus
prayed
he
threw
the
cup
into
the
hellespont
and
with
it
a
golden
and
a
persian
sword
which
they
call
akinakes
but
whether
he
cast
them
into
the
sea
as
an
offering
dedicated
to
the
sun
or
whether
he
had
repented
of
his
scourging
of
the
hellespont
and
desired
to
present
a
gift
to
the
sea
as
amends
for
this
i
can
not
for
certain
say
when
xerxes
had
done
this
they
proceeded
to
cross
over
the
whole
army
both
the
footmen
and
the
horsemen
going
by
one
bridge
namely
that
which
was
on
the
side
of
the
pontus
while
the
and
the
attendants
went
over
the
other
which
was
towards
the
egean
first
the
ten
thousand
persians
led
the
way
all
with
wreaths
and
after
them
came
the
mixed
body
of
the
army
made
up
of
all
kinds
of
nations
these
on
that
day
and
on
the
next
day
first
the
horsemen
and
those
who
had
their
turned
downwards
these
also
wearing
wreaths
and
after
them
the
sacred
horses
and
the
sacred
chariot
and
then
xerxes
himself
and
the
and
the
thousand
horsemen
and
after
them
the
rest
of
the
army
in
the
meantime
the
ships
also
put
out
from
shore
and
went
over
to
the
opposite
side
i
have
heard
however
another
account
which
says
that
the
king
crossed
over
the
very
last
of
all
when
xerxes
had
crossed
over
into
europe
he
gazed
upon
the
army
crossing
under
the
lash
and
his
army
crossed
over
in
seven
days
and
seven
nights
going
on
continuously
without
any
pause
then
it
is
said
after
xerxes
had
now
crossed
over
the
hellespont
a
man
of
that
coast
exclaimed
why
o
zeus
in
the
likeness
of
a
persian
man
and
taking
for
thyself
the
name
of
xerxes
instead
of
zeus
art
thou
proposing
to
lay
waste
hellas
taking
with
thee
all
the
nations
of
men
for
it
was
possible
for
thee
to
do
so
even
without
the
help
of
these
when
all
had
crossed
over
after
they
had
set
forth
on
their
way
a
great
portent
appeared
to
them
of
which
xerxes
made
no
account
although
it
was
easy
to
conjecture
its
meaning
a
mare
gave
birth
to
a
hare
now
the
meaning
of
this
was
easy
to
conjecture
in
this
way
namely
that
xerxes
was
about
to
march
an
army
against
hellas
very
proudly
and
magnificently
but
would
come
back
again
to
the
place
whence
he
came
running
for
his
life
there
happened
also
a
portent
of
another
kind
while
he
was
still
at
sardis
a
mule
brought
forth
young
and
gave
birth
to
a
mule
which
had
organs
of
generation
of
two
kinds
both
those
of
the
male
and
those
of
the
female
and
those
of
the
male
were
above
xerxes
however
made
no
account
of
either
of
these
portents
but
proceeded
on
his
way
and
with
him
the
the
fleet
meanwhile
was
sailing
out
of
the
hellespont
and
coasting
along
going
in
the
opposite
direction
to
the
for
the
fleet
was
sailing
towards
the
west
making
for
the
promontory
of
sarpedon
to
which
it
had
been
ordered
beforehand
to
go
and
there
wait
for
the
army
but
the
meanwhile
was
making
its
march
towards
the
east
and
the
sunrising
through
the
chersonese
keeping
on
its
right
the
tomb
of
helle
the
daughter
of
athamas
and
on
its
left
the
city
of
cardia
and
marching
through
the
midst
of
a
town
the
name
of
which
is
agora
thence
bending
round
the
gulf
called
melas
and
having
crossed
over
the
river
melas
the
stream
of
which
did
not
suffice
at
this
time
for
the
army
but
failed
having
crossed
i
say
this
river
from
which
the
gulf
also
has
its
name
it
went
on
westwards
passing
by
ainos
a
city
of
the
aiolians
and
by
the
lake
stentoris
until
at
last
it
came
to
doriscos
now
doriscos
is
a
and
plain
of
great
extent
in
thrace
and
through
it
flows
the
great
river
hebros
here
a
royal
fortress
had
been
built
the
same
which
is
now
called
doriscos
and
a
garrison
of
persians
had
been
established
in
it
by
dareios
ever
since
the
time
when
he
went
on
his
march
against
the
scythians
it
seemed
then
to
xerxes
that
the
place
was
convenient
to
order
his
army
and
to
number
it
throughout
and
so
he
proceeded
to
do
the
commanders
of
the
ships
at
the
bidding
of
xerxes
had
brought
all
their
ships
when
they
arrived
at
doriscos
up
to
the
which
adjoins
doriscos
on
which
there
is
situated
both
sale
a
city
of
the
samothrakians
and
also
zone
and
of
which
the
extreme
point
is
the
promontory
of
serreion
which
is
well
known
and
the
region
belonged
in
ancient
time
to
the
kikonians
to
this
beach
then
they
had
brought
in
their
ships
and
having
drawn
them
up
on
land
they
were
letting
them
get
dry
and
during
this
time
he
proceeded
to
number
the
army
at
doriscos
now
of
the
number
which
each
separate
nation
supplied
i
am
not
able
to
give
certain
information
for
this
is
not
reported
by
any
persons
but
of
the
whole
taken
together
the
number
proved
to
be
one
hundred
and
seventy
myriads
and
they
numbered
them
throughout
in
the
following
manner
they
gathered
together
in
one
place
a
body
of
ten
thousand
men
and
packing
them
together
as
closely
as
they
could
they
drew
a
circle
round
outside
and
thus
having
drawn
a
circle
round
and
having
let
the
ten
thousand
men
go
from
it
they
built
a
wall
of
rough
stones
round
the
circumference
of
the
circle
rising
to
the
height
of
a
man
navel
having
made
this
they
caused
others
to
go
into
the
space
which
had
been
built
round
until
they
had
in
this
manner
numbered
them
all
throughout
and
after
they
had
numbered
them
they
ordered
them
separately
by
nations
now
those
who
served
were
as
follows
the
persians
with
this
equipment
about
their
heads
they
had
soft
felt
caps
called
tiaras
and
about
their
body
tunics
of
various
colours
with
sleeves
presenting
the
appearance
of
iron
scales
like
those
of
a
fish
and
about
the
legs
trousers
and
instead
of
the
ordinary
shields
they
had
shields
of
under
which
hung
quivers
and
they
had
short
spears
and
large
bows
and
arrows
of
reed
and
moreover
daggers
hanging
by
the
right
thigh
from
the
girdle
and
they
acknowledged
as
their
commander
otanes
the
father
of
amestris
the
wife
of
xerxes
now
these
were
called
by
the
hellenes
in
ancient
time
kephenes
by
themselves
however
and
by
their
neighbours
they
were
called
artaians
but
when
perseus
the
son
of
danae
and
zeus
came
to
kepheus
the
son
of
belos
and
took
to
wife
his
daughter
andromeda
there
was
born
to
them
a
son
to
whom
he
gave
the
name
perses
and
this
son
he
left
behind
there
for
it
chanced
that
kepheus
had
no
male
offspring
after
him
therefore
this
race
was
named
the
medes
served
in
the
expedition
equipped
in
precisely
the
same
manner
for
this
equipment
is
in
fact
median
and
not
persian
and
the
medes
acknowledged
as
their
commander
tigranes
an
achaimenid
these
in
ancient
time
used
to
be
generally
called
arians
but
when
medea
the
colchian
came
from
athens
to
these
arians
they
also
changed
their
name
thus
the
medes
themselves
report
about
themselves
the
kissians
served
with
equipment
in
other
respects
like
that
of
the
persians
but
instead
of
the
felt
caps
they
wore
fillets
of
the
kissians
anaphes
the
son
of
otanes
was
commander
the
hyrcanians
were
armed
like
the
persians
acknowledging
as
their
leader
megapanos
the
same
who
after
these
events
became
governor
of
babylon
the
assyrians
served
with
helmets
about
their
heads
made
of
bronze
or
plaited
in
a
barbarian
style
which
it
is
not
easy
to
describe
and
they
had
shields
and
spears
and
daggers
like
the
egyptian
knives
and
moreover
they
had
wooden
clubs
with
knobs
of
iron
and
corslets
of
linen
these
are
by
the
hellenes
called
syrians
but
by
the
barbarians
they
have
been
called
always
assyrians
among
these
were
the
chaldeans
and
the
commander
of
them
was
otaspes
the
son
of
artachaies
the
bactrians
served
wearing
about
their
heads
nearly
the
same
covering
as
the
medes
and
having
native
bows
of
reed
and
short
spears
the
scaran
scythians
had
about
their
heads
caps
which
were
carried
up
to
a
point
and
set
upright
and
stiff
and
they
wore
trousers
and
carried
native
bows
and
daggers
and
besides
this
axes
of
the
kind
called
sagaris
these
were
called
amyrgian
sacans
being
in
fact
scythians
for
the
persians
call
all
the
scythians
sacans
and
of
the
bactrians
and
sacans
the
commander
was
hystaspes
the
son
of
dareios
and
of
atossa
the
daughter
of
cyrus
the
indians
wore
garments
made
of
and
they
had
bows
of
reed
and
arrows
of
reed
with
iron
points
thus
were
the
indians
equipped
and
serving
with
the
rest
they
had
been
assigned
to
pharnazathres
the
son
of
artabates
the
arians
were
equipped
with
median
bows
and
in
other
respects
like
the
bactrians
and
of
the
arians
sisamnes
the
son
of
hydarnes
was
in
command
the
parthians
and
chorasmians
and
sogdians
and
gandarians
and
dadicans
served
with
the
same
equipment
as
the
bactrians
of
these
the
commanders
were
artabazos
the
son
of
pharnakes
of
the
parthians
and
chorasmians
azanes
the
son
of
artaios
of
the
sogdians
and
artyphios
the
son
of
artabanos
of
the
gandarians
and
dadicans
the
caspians
served

the
ethiopians

in
two
bodies

been
appointed
to
serve
with
the

arms
very
closely
resembling

lasonians
had
the
same
equipment
as
the
kilikians
and
what
this
was
i
shall
explain
when
in
the
course
of
the
catalogue
i
come
to
the
array
of
the
kilikians
the

and
macronians
and
mossynoicoi
served
with
equipment
like
that
of
the
moschoi
and
these
were
arrayed
together
under
the
following
commanders
the
moschoi
and
tibarenians
under
ariomardos
who
was
the
son
of
dareios
and

the
commander
was
pharandates
the
son
of
teaspis
the
alarodians
and
saspeirians
served
armed
like
the
colchians
and
of
these
the
commander
was
masistios
the
son
of
siromitres
the
island
tribes
which
came
with
the
army
from
the
erythraian
sea
belonging
to
the
islands
in
which
the
king
settles
those
who
are
called
the
removed
had
clothing
and
arms
very
like
those
of
the
medes
of
these
islanders
the
commander
was
mardontes
the
son
of
bagaios
who
in
the
year
after
these
events
was
a
commander
of
the
army
at
mykale
and
lost
his
life
in
the
battle
these
were
the
nations
which
served
in
the
campaign
by
land
and
had
been
appointed
to
be
among
the
of
this
army
those
who
have
been
mentioned
were
commanders
and
they
were
the
men
who
sit
it
in
order
by
divisions
and
numbered
it
and
appointed
commanders
of
thousands
and
commanders
of
tens
of
thousands
but
the
commanders
of
hundreds
and
of
tens
were
appointed
by
the
commanders
of
ten
thousands
and
there
were
others
who
were
leaders
of
divisions
and
nations
these
i
say
who
have
been
mentioned
were
commanders
of
the
army
and
over
these
and
over
the
whole
army
together
that
went
on
foot
there
were
in
command
mardonios
the
son
of
gobryas
tritantaichmes
the
son
of
that
artabanos
who
gave
the
opinion
that
they
should
not
make
the
march
against
hellas
smerdomenes
the
son
of
otanes
both
these
being
sons
of
brothers
of
dareios
and
so
cousins
of
xerxes
masistes
the
son
of
dareios
and
atossa
gergis
the
son
of
ariazos
and
megabyzos
the
son
of
zopyros
these
were
generals
of
the
whole
together
that
went
on
foot
excepting
the
ten
thousand
and
of
these
ten
thousand
chosen
persians
the
general
was
hydarnes
the
son
of
hydarnes
and
these
persians
were
called
immortals
because
if
any
one
of
them
made
the
number
incomplete
being
overcome
either
by
death
or
disease
another
man
was
chosen
to
his
place
and
they
were
never
either
more
or
fewer
than
ten
thousand
now
of
all
the
nations
the
persians
showed
the
greatest
splendour
of
ornament
and
were
themselves
the
best
men
they
had
equipment
such
as
has
been
mentioned
and
besides
this
they
were
conspicuous
among
the
rest
for
great
quantity
of
gold
freely
used
and
they
took
with
them
carriages
and
in
them
concubines
and
a
multitude
of
attendants
well
furnished
and
provisions
for
them
apart
from
the
soldiers
were
borne
by
camels
and
beasts
of
burden
the
nations
who
serve
as
cavalry
are
these
not
all
however
supplied
cavalry
but
only
as
many
as
here
follow
the
persians
equipped
in
the
same
manner
as
their
except
that
upon
their
heads
some
of
them
had
of
metal
either
bronze
or
iron
there
are
also
certain
nomads
called
sagartians
persian
in
race
and
in
language
and
having
a
dress
which
is
midway
between
that
of
the
persians
and
that
of
the
pactyans
these
furnished
eight
thousand
horse
and
they
are
not
accustomed
to
have
any
arms
either
of
bronze
or
of
iron
excepting
daggers
but
they
use
ropes
twisted
of
thongs
and
trust
to
these
when
they
go
into
war
and
the
manner
of
fighting
of
these
men
is
as
follows
when
they
come
to
conflict
with
the
enemy
they
throw
the
ropes
with
nooses
at
the
end
of
them
and
whatsoever
the
man
catches
by
the
throw
whether
horse
or
man
he
draws
to
himself
and
they
being
entangled
in
toils
are
thus
destroyed
this
is
the
manner
of
fighting
of
these
men
and
they
were
arrayed
next
to
the
persians
the
medes
had
the
same
equipment
as
their
men
on
foot
and
the
kissians
likewise
the
indians
were
armed
in
the
same
manner
as
those
of
them
who
served
on
foot
and
they
both
rode
horses
and
drove
chariots
in
which
were
harnessed
horses
or
wild
asses
the
bactrians
were
equipped
in
the
same
way
as
those
who
served
on
foot
and
the
caspians
likewise
the
libyans
too
were
equipped
like
those
who
served
on
foot
and
these
also
all
drove
chariots
so
too
the
caspians
and
paricanians
were
equipped
like
those
who
served
on
foot
and
they
all
rode
on
camels
which
in
swiftness
were
not
inferior
to
horses
these
nations
alone
served
as
cavalry
and
the
number
of
the
cavalry
proved
to
be
eight
myriads
apart
from
the
camels
and
the
chariots
now
the
rest
of
the
cavalry
was
arrayed
in
squadrons
but
the
arabians
were
placed
after
them
and
last
of
all
for
the
horses
could
not
endure
the
camels
and
therefore
they
were
placed
last
in
order
that
the
horses
might
not
be
frightened
the
commanders
of
the
cavalry
were
harmamithras
and
tithaios
sons
of
datis
but
the
third
pharnuches
who
was
in
command
of
the
horse
with
them
had
been
left
behind
at
sardis
sick
for
as
they
were
setting
forth
from
sardis
an
accident
befell
him
of
an
kind
as
he
was
riding
a
dog
ran
up
under
his
horse
feet
and
the
horse
not
having
seen
it
beforehand
was
frightened
and
rearing
up
he
threw
pharnuches
off
his
back
who
falling
vomited
blood
and
his
sickness
turned
to
a
consumption
to
the
horse
however
they
forthwith
at
the
first
did
as
he
commanded
that
is
to
say
the
servants
led
him
away
to
the
place
where
he
had
thrown
his
master
and
cut
off
his
legs
at
the
knees
thus
was
pharnuches
removed
from
his
command
of
the
triremes
the
number
proved
to
be
one
thousand
two
hundred
and
seven
and
these
were
they
who
furnished
them
the
phenicians
together
with
the
syrians
who
dwell
in
palestine
furnished
three
hundred
and
they
were
equipped
thus
that
is
to
say
they
had
about
their
heads
leathern
caps
made
very
nearly
in
the
hellenic
fashion
and
they
wore
corslets
of
linen
and
had
shields
without
rims
and
javelins
these
phenicians
dwelt
in
ancient
time
as
they
themselves
report
upon
the
erythraian
sea
and
thence
they
passed
over
and
dwell
in
the
country
along
the
sea
coast
of
syria
and
this
part
of
syria
and
all
as
far
as
egypt
is
called
palestine
the
egyptians
furnished
two
hundred
ships
these
men
had
about
their
heads
helmets
of
plaited
work
and
they
had
hollow
shields
with
the
rims
large
and
spears
for
and
large
axes
the
greater
number
of
them
wore
corslets
and
they
had
large
knives
these
men
were
thus
equipped
and
the
cyprians
furnished
a
hundred
and
fifty
ships
being
themselves
equipped
as
follows
their
kings
had
their
heads
wound
round
with
fillets
and
the
rest
had
tunics
but
in
other
respects
they
were
like
the
hellenes
among
these
there
are
various
races
as
follows
some
of
them
are
from
salamis
and
athens
others
from
arcadia
others
from
kythnos
others
again
from
phenicia
and
others
from
ethiopia
as
the
cyprians
themselves
report
the
kilikians
furnished
a
hundred
ships
and
these
again
had
about
their
heads
native
helmets
and
for
shields
they
carried
targets
made
of
raw
they
wore
tunics
of
wool
and
each
man
had
two
javelins
and
a
sword
this
last
being
made
very
like
the
egyptian
knives
these
in
old
time
were
called
hypachaians
and
they
got
their
later
name
from
kilix
the
son
of
agenor
a
phenician
the
pamphylians
furnished
thirty
ships
and
were
equipped
in
hellenic
arms
these
pamphylians
are
of
those
who
were
dispersed
from
troy
together
with
amphilochos
and
calchas
the
lykians
furnished
fifty
ships
and
they
were
wearers
of
corslets
and
greaves
and
had
bows
of
and
arrows
of
reeds
without
feathers
and
javelins
and
a
hanging
over
their
shoulders
and
about
their
heads
felt
caps
wreathed
round
with
feathers
also
they
had
daggers
and
falchions
the
lykians
were
formerly
called
termilai
being
originally
of
crete
and
they
got
their
later
name
from
lycos
the
son
of
pandion
an
athenian
the
dorians
of
asia
furnished
thirty
ships
and
these
had
hellenic
arms
and
were
originally
from
the
peloponnese
the
carians
supplied
seventy
ships
and
they
were
equipped
in
other
respects
like
hellenes
but
they
had
also
falchions
and
daggers
what
was
the
former
name
of
these
has
been
told
in
the
first
part
of
the
history
the
ionians
furnished
a
hundred
ships
and
were
equipped
like
hellenes
now
the
ionians
so
long
time
as
they
dwelt
in
the
peloponnese
in
the
land
which
is
now
called
achaia
and
before
the
time
when
danaos
and
xuthos
came
to
the
peloponnese
were
called
as
the
hellenes
report
pelasgians
of
the
and
then
ionians
after
ion
the
son
of
xuthos
the
islanders
furnished
seventeen
ships
and
were
armed
like
hellenes
this
also
being
a
pelasgian
race
though
afterwards
it
came
to
be
called
ionian
by
the
same
rule
as
the
ionians
of
the
twelve
cities
who
came
from
athens
the
aiolians
supplied
sixty
ships
and
these
were
equipped
like
hellenes
and
used
to
be
called
pelasgians
in
the
old
time
as
the
hellenes
report
the
hellespontians
excepting
those
of
abydos
for
the
men
of
abydos
had
been
appointed
by
the
king
to
stay
in
their
place
and
be
guards
of
the
bridges
the
rest
i
say
of
those
who
served
in
the
expedition
from
the
pontus
furnished
a
hundred
ships
and
were
equipped
like
hellenes
these
are
colonists
of
the
ionians
and
dorians
in
all
the
ships
there
served
as
persians
medes
or
sacans
and
of
the
ships
those
which
sailed
best
were
furnished
by
the
phenicians
and
of
the
phenicians
the
best
by
the
men
of
sidon
over
all
these
men
and
also
over
those
of
them
who
were
appointed
to
serve
in
the
there
were
for
each
tribe
native
chieftains
of
whom
since
i
am
not
compelled
by
the
course
of
the
inquiry
i
make
no
mention
by
the
way
for
in
the
first
place
the
chieftains
of
each
separate
nation
were
not
persons
worthy
of
mention
and
then
moreover
within
each
nation
there
were
as
many
chieftains
as
there
were
cities
these
went
with
the
expedition
too
not
as
commanders
but
like
the
others
serving
as
slaves
for
the
generals
who
had
the
absolute
power
and
commanded
the
various
nations
that
is
to
say
those
who
were
persians
having
already
been
mentioned
by
me
of
the
naval
force
the
following
were
commanders
ariabignes
the
son
of
dareios
prexaspes
the
son
of
aspathines
megabazos
the
son
of
megabates
and
achaimenes
the
son
of
dareios
that
is
to
say
of
the
ionian
and
carian
force
ariabignes
who
was
the
son
of
dareios
and
of
the
daughter
of
gobryas
of
the
egyptians
achaimenes
was
commander
being
brother
of
xerxes
by
both
parents
and
of
the
rest
of
the
armament
the
other
two
were
in
command
and
galleys
of
thirty
oars
and
of
fifty
oars
and
light
vessels
and
long
ships
to
carry
horses
had
been
assembled
together
as
it
proved
to
the
number
of
three
thousand
of
those
who
sailed
in
the
ships
the
men
of
most
note
after
the
commanders
were
these
of
sidon
tetramnestos
son
of
anysos
of
tyre
matten
son
of
siromos
or
arados
merbalos
son
of
agbalos
of
kilikia
syennesis
son
of
oromedon
of
lykia
kyberniscos
son
of
sicas
of
cyprus
gorgos
son
of
chersis
and
timonax
son
of
timagoras
of
caria
histiaios
son
of
tymnes
pigres
son
of
hysseldomos
and
damasithymos
son
of
candaules
of
the
rest
of
the
officers
i
make
no
mention
by
the
way
since
i
am
not
bound
to
do
so
but
only
of
artemisia
at
whom
i
marvel
most
that
she
joined
the
expedition
against
hellas
being
a
woman
for
after
her
husband
died
she
holding
the
power
herself
although
she
had
a
son
who
was
a
young
man
went
on
the
expedition
impelled
by
high
spirit
and
manly
courage
no
necessity
being
laid
upon
her
now
her
name
as
i
said
was
artemisia
and
she
was
the
daughter
of
lygdamis
and
by
descent
she
was
of
halicarnassos
on
the
side
of
her
father
but
of
crete
by
her
mother
she
was
ruler
of
the
men
of
halicarnassos
and
cos
and
nisyros
and
calydna
furnishing
five
ships
and
she
furnished
ships
which
were
of
all
the
fleet
reputed
the
best
after
those
of
the
sidonians
and
of
all
his
allies
she
set
forth
the
best
counsels
to
the
king
of
the
states
of
which
i
said
that
she
was
leader
i
declare
the
people
to
be
all
of
dorian
race
those
of
halicarnassos
being
troizenians
and
the
rest
epidaurians
so
far
then
i
have
spoken
of
the
naval
force
then
when
xerxes
had
numbered
the
army
and
it
had
been
arranged
in
divisions
he
had
a
mind
to
drive
through
it
himself
and
inspect
it
and
afterwards
he
proceeded
so
to
do
and
driving
through
in
a
chariot
by
each
nation
he
inquired
about
them
and
his
scribes
wrote
down
the
names
until
he
had
gone
from
end
to
end
both
of
the
horse
and
of
the
foot
when
he
had
done
this
the
ships
were
drawn
down
into
the
sea
and
xerxes
changing
from
his
chariot
to
a
ship
of
sidon
sat
down
under
a
golden
canopy
and
sailed
along
by
the
prows
of
the
ships
asking
of
all
just
as
he
had
done
with
the
and
having
the
answers
written
down
and
the
captains
had
taken
their
ships
out
to
a
distance
of
about
four
hundred
feet
from
the
beach
and
were
staying
them
there
all
having
turned
the
prows
of
the
ships
towards
the
shore
in
an
even
line
and
having
armed
all
the
as
for
war
and
he
inspected
them
sailing
within
between
the
prows
of
the
ships
and
the
beach
now
when
he
had
sailed
through
these
and
had
disembarked
from
his
ship
he
sent
for
demaratos
the
son
of
ariston
who
was
marching
with
him
against
hellas
and
having
called
him
he
asked
as
follows
demaratos
now
it
is
my
pleasure
to
ask
thee
somewhat
which
i
desire
to
know
thou
art
not
only
a
hellene
but
also
as
i
am
informed
both
by
thee
and
by
the
other
hellenes
who
come
to
speech
with
me
of
a
city
which
is
neither
the
least
nor
the
feeblest
of
hellas
now
therefore
declare
to
me
this
namely
whether
the
hellenes
will
endure
to
raise
hands
against
me
for
as
i
suppose
even
if
all
the
hellenes
and
the
remaining
nations
who
dwell
towards
the
west
should
be
gathered
together
they
are
not
strong
enough
in
fight
to
endure
my
attack
supposing
them
to
be
my
enemies
i
desire
however
to
be
informed
also
of
thy
opinion
what
thou
sayest
about
these
matters
he
inquired
thus
and
the
other
made
answer
and
said
o
king
shall
i
utter
the
truth
in
speaking
to
thee
or
that
which
will
give
pleasure
and
he
bade
him
utter
the
truth
saying
that
he
should
suffer
nothing
unpleasant
in
consequence
of
this
any
more
than
he
suffered
before
when
demaratos
heard
this
he
spoke
as
follows
o
king
since
thou
biddest
me
by
all
means
utter
the
truth
and
so
speak
as
one
who
shall
not
be
afterwards
convicted
by
thee
of
having
spoken
falsely
i
say
this
with
hellas
poverty
is
ever
an
inbred
growth
while
valour
is
one
that
has
been
brought
in
being
acquired
by
intelligence
and
the
force
of
law
and
of
it
hellas
makes
use
ever
to
avert
from
herself
not
only
poverty
but
also
servitude
to
a
master
now
i
commend
all
the
hellenes
who
are
settled
in
those
dorian
lands
but
this
which
i
am
about
to
say
has
regard
not
to
all
but
to
the
lacedemonians
alone
of
these
i
say
first
that
it
is
not
possible
that
they
will
ever
accept
thy
terms
which
carry
with
them
servitude
for
hellas
and
next
i
say
that
they
will
stand
against
thee
in
fight
even
if
all
the
other
hellenes
shall
be
of
thy
party
and
as
for
numbers
ask
now
how
many
they
are
that
they
are
able
to
do
this
for
whether
it
chances
that
a
thousand
of
them
have
come
out
into
the
field
these
will
fight
with
thee
or
if
there
be
less
than
this
or
again
if
there
be
more
xerxes
hearing
this
laughed
and
said
demaratos
what
a
speech
is
this
which
thou
hast
uttered
saying
that
a
thousand
men
will
fight
with
this
vast
army
come
tell
me
this
thou
sayest
that
thou
wert
thyself
king
of
these
men
wilt
thou
therefore
consent
forthwith
to
fight
with
ten
men
and
yet
if
your
state
is
such
throughout
as
thou
dost
describe
it
thou
their
king
ought
by
your
laws
to
stand
in
array
against
double
as
many
as
another
man
that
is
to
say
if
each
of
them
is
a
match
for
ten
men
of
my
army
i
expect
of
thee
that
thou
shouldest
be
a
match
for
twenty
thus
would
be
confirmed
the
report
which
is
made
by
thee
but
if
ye
who
boast
thus
greatly
are
such
men
and
in
size
so
great
only
as
the
hellenes
who
come
commonly
to
speech
with
me
thyself
included
then
beware
lest
this
which
has
been
spoken
prove
but
an
empty
vaunt
for
come
let
me
examine
it
by
all
that
is
probable
how
could
a
thousand
or
ten
thousand
or
even
fifty
thousand
at
least
if
they
were
all
equally
free
and
were
not
ruled
by
one
man
stand
against
so
great
an
army
since
as
thou
knowest
we
shall
be
more
than
a
thousand
coming
about
each
one
of
them
supposing
them
to
be
in
number
five
thousand
if
indeed
they
were
ruled
by
one
man
after
our
fashion
they
might
perhaps
from
fear
of
him
become
braver
than
it
was
their
nature
to
be
or
they
might
go
compelled
by
the
lash
to
fight
with
greater
numbers
being
themselves
fewer
in
number
but
if
left
at
liberty
they
would
do
neither
of
these
things
and
i
for
my
part
suppose
that
even
if
equally
matched
in
numbers
the
hellenes
would
hardly
dare
to
fight
with
the
persians
taken
alone
with
us
however
this
of
which
thou
speakest
is
found
in
single
men
not
indeed
often
but
rarely
for
there
are
persians
of
my
spearmen
who
will
consent
to
fight
with
three
men
of
the
hellenes
at
once
but
thou
hast
had
no
experience
of
these
things
and
therefore
thou
speakest
very
much
at
random
to
this
demaratos
replied
o
king
from
the
first
i
was
sure
that
if
i
uttered
the
truth
i
should
not
speak
that
which
was
pleasing
to
thee
since
however
thou
didst
compel
me
to
speak
the
very
truth
i
told
thee
of
the
matters
which
concern
the
spartans
and
yet
how
i
am
at
this
present
time
attached
to
them
by
affection
thou
knowest
better
than
any
seeing
that
first
they
took
away
from
me
the
rank
and
privileges
which
came
to
me
from
my
fathers
and
then
also
they
have
caused
me
to
be
without
native
land
and
an
exile
but
thy
father
took
me
up
and
gave
me
livelihood
and
a
house
to
dwell
in
surely
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
likely
that
the
prudent
man
will
thrust
aside
friendliness
which
is
offered
to
him
but
rather
that
he
will
accept
it
with
full
contentment
and
i
do
not
profess
that
i
am
able
to
fight
either
with
ten
men
or
with
two
nay
if
i
had
my
will
i
would
not
even
fight
with
one
but
if
there
were
necessity
or
if
the
cause
which
urged
me
to
the
combat
were
a
great
one
i
would
fight
most
willingly
with
one
of
these
men
who
says
that
he
is
a
match
for
three
of
the
hellenes
so
also
the
lacedemonians
are
not
inferior
to
any
men
when
fighting
one
by
one
and
they
are
the
best
of
all
men
when
fighting
in
a
body
for
though
free
yet
they
are
not
free
in
all
things
for
over
them
is
set
law
as
a
master
whom
they
fear
much
more
even
than
thy
people
fear
thee
it
is
certain
at
least
that
they
do
whatsoever
that
master
commands
and
he
commands
ever
the
same
thing
that
is
to
say
he
bids
them
not
flee
out
of
battle
from
any
multitude
of
men
but
stay
in
their
post
and
win
the
victory
or
lose
their
life
but
if
when
i
say
these
things
i
seem
to
thee
to
be
speaking
at
random
of
other
things
for
the
future
i
prefer
to
be
silent
and
at
this
time
i
spake
only
because
i
was
compelled
may
it
come
to
pass
however
according
to
thy
mind
o
king
he
thus
made
answer
and
xerxes
turned
the
matter
to
laughter
and
felt
no
anger
but
dismissed
him
with
kindness
then
after
he
had
conversed
with
him
and
had
appointed
mascames
son
of
megadostes
to
be
governor
at
this
place
doriscos
removing
the
governor
who
had
been
appointed
by
dareios
xerxes
marched
forth
his
army
through
thrace
to
invade
hellas
and
mascames
whom
he
left
behind
here
proved
to
be
a
man
of
such
qualities
that
to
him
alone
xerxes
used
to
send
gifts
considering
him
the
best
of
all
the
men
whom
either
he
himself
or
dareios
had
appointed
to
be
governors
he
used
to
send
him
gifts
i
say
every
year
and
so
also
did
artaxerxes
the
son
of
xerxes
to
the
descendants
of
mascames
for
even
before
this
march
governors
had
been
appointed
in
thrace
and
everywhere
about
the
hellespont
and
these
all
both
those
in
thrace
and
in
the
hellespont
were
conquered
by
the
hellenes
after
this
expedition
except
only
the
one
who
was
at
doriscos
but
mascames
at
doriscos
none
were
ever
able
to
conquer
though
many
tried
for
this
reason
the
gifts
are
sent
continually
for
him
from
the
king
who
reigns
over
the
persians
of
those
however
who
were
conquered
by
the
hellenes
xerxes
did
not
consider
any
to
be
a
good
man
except
only
boges
who
was
at
eïon
him
he
never
ceased
commending
and
he
honoured
very
highly
his
children
who
survived
him
in
the
land
of
persia
for
in
truth
boges
proved
himself
worthy
of
great
commendation
seeing
that
when
he
was
besieged
by
the
athenians
under
kimon
the
son
of
miltiades
though
he
might
have
gone
forth
under
a
truce
and
so
returned
home
to
asia
he
preferred
not
to
do
this
for
fear
that
the
king
should
that
it
was
by
cowardice
that
he
survived
and
he
continued
to
hold
out
till
the
last
then
when
there
was
no
longer
any
supply
of
provisions
within
the
wall
he
heaped
together
a
great
pyre
and
he
cut
the
throats
of
his
children
his
wife
his
concubines
and
his
servants
and
threw
them
into
the
fire
and
after
this
he
scattered
all
the
gold
and
silver
in
the
city
from
the
wall
into
the
river
strymon
and
having
so
done
he
threw
himself
into
the
fire
thus
he
is
justly
commended
even
to
this
present
time
by
the
persians
xerxes
from
doriscos
was
proceeding
onwards
to
invade
hellas
and
as
he
went
he
compelled
those
who
successively
came
in
his
way
to
join
his
march
for
the
whole
country
as
far
as
thessaly
had
been
reduced
to
subjection
as
has
been
set
forth
by
me
before
and
was
tributary
under
the
king
having
been
subdued
by
megabazos
and
afterwards
by
mardonios
and
he
passed
in
his
march
from
doriscos
first
by
the
samothrakian
strongholds
of
which
that
which
is
situated
furthest
towards
the
west
is
a
city
called
mesambria
next
to
this
follows
stryme
a
city
of
the
thasians
and
midway
between
them
flows
the
river
lisos
which
at
this
time
did
not
suffice
when
supplying
its
water
to
the
army
of
xerxes
but
the
stream
failed
this
country
was
in
old
time
called
gallaïke
but
now
briantike
however
by
strict
justice
this
also
belongs
to
the
kikonians
having
crossed
over
the
bed
of
the
river
lisos
after
it
had
been
dried
up
he
passed
by
these
hellenic
cities
namely
maroneia
dicaia
and
abdera
these
i
say
he
passed
by
and
also
the
following
lakes
of
note
lying
near
them
the
ismarian
lake
lying
between
maroneia
and
stryme
the
bistonian
lake
near
dicaia
into
which
two
rivers
pour
their
waters
the
trauos
and
the
compsantos
and
at
abdera
no
lake
indeed
of
any
note
was
passed
by
xerxes
but
the
river
nestos
which
flows
there
into
the
sea
then
after
passing
these
places
he
went
by
the
cities
of
the
mainland
near
one
of
which
there
is
as
it
chances
a
lake
of
somewhere
about
thirty
furlongs
in
circumference
abounding
in
fish
and
very
brackish
this
the
alone
dried
up
being
watered
at
it
and
the
name
of
this
city
is
pistyros
these
cities
i
say
lying
by
the
sea
coast
and
belonging
to
hellenes
he
passed
by
leaving
them
on
the
left
hand
and
the
tribes
of
thracians
through
whose
country
he
marched
were
as
follows
namely
the
paitians
kikonians
bistonians
sapaians
dersaians
edonians
satrians
of
these
they
who
were
settled
along
the
sea
coast
accompanied
him
with
their
ships
and
those
of
them
who
dwelt
inland
and
have
been
enumerated
by
me
were
compelled
to
accompany
him
on
land
except
the
satrians
the
satrians
however
never
yet
became
obedient
to
any
man
so
far
as
we
know
but
they
remain
up
to
my
time
still
free
alone
of
all
the
thracians
for
they
dwell
in
lofty
mountains
which
are
covered
with
forest
of
all
kinds
and
with
snow
and
also
they
are
very
skilful
in
war
these
are
they
who
possess
the
oracle
of
dionysos
which
oracle
is
on
their
most
lofty
mountains
of
the
satrians
those
who
act
as
prophets
of
the
temple
are
the
bessians
it
is
a
prophetess
who
utters
the
oracles
as
at
delphi
and
beyond
this
there
is
nothing
further
of
a
remarkable
character
xerxes
having
passed
over
the
land
which
has
been
spoken
of
next
after
this
passed
the
strongholds
of
the
pierians
of
which
the
name
of
the
one
is
phagres
and
of
the
other
pergamos
by
this
way
i
say
he
made
his
march
going
close
by
the
walls
of
these
and
keeping
mount
pangaion
on
the
right
hand
which
is
both
great
and
lofty
and
in
which
are
mines
both
of
gold
and
of
silver
possessed
by
the
pierians
and
odomantians
and
especially
by
the
satrians
thus
passing
by
the
paionians
doberians
and
paioplians
who
dwell
beyond
pangaion
towards
the
north
wind
he
went
on
westwards
until
at
last
he
came
to
the
river
strymon
and
the
city
of
eïon
of
which
so
long
as
he
lived
boges
was
commander
the
same
about
whom
i
was
speaking
a
short
time
back
this
country
about
mount
pangaion
is
called
phyllis
and
it
extends
westwards
to
the
river
angites
which
flows
into
the
strymon
and
southwards
it
stretches
to
the
strymon
itself
and
at
this
river
the
magians
sacrificed
for
good
omens
slaying
white
horses
having
done
this
and
many
other
things
in
addition
to
this
as
charms
for
the
river
at
the
nine
ways
in
the
land
of
the
edonians
they
proceeded
by
the
bridges
for
they
had
found
the
strymon
already
yoked
with
bridges
and
being
informed
that
this
place
was
called
the
nine
ways
they
buried
alive
in
it
that
number
of
boys
and
maidens
children
of
the
natives
of
the
place
now
burying
alive
is
a
persian
custom
for
i
am
informed
that
amestris
also
the
wife
of
xerxes
when
she
had
grown
old
made
return
for
her
own
life
to
the
god
who
is
said
to
be
beneath
the
earth
by
burying
twice
seven
children
of
persians
who
were
men
of
renown
as
the
army
proceeded
on
its
march
from
the
strymon
it
found
after
this
a
stretching
towards
the
setting
of
the
sun
and
passed
by
the
hellenic
city
argilos
which
was
there
placed
this
region
and
that
which
lies
above
it
is
called
bisaltia
thence
keeping
on
the
left
hand
the
gulf
which
lies
of
posideion
he
went
through
the
plain
which
is
called
the
plain
of
syleus
passing
by
stageiros
a
hellenic
city
and
so
came
to
acanthos
taking
with
him
as
he
went
each
one
of
these
tribes
and
also
of
those
who
dwell
about
mount
pangaion
just
as
he
did
those
whom
i
enumerated
before
having
the
men
who
dwelt
along
the
sea
coast
to
serve
in
the
ships
and
those
who
dwelt
inland
to
accompany
him
on
foot
this
road
by
which
xerxes
the
king
marched
his
army
the
thracians
do
not
disturb
nor
sow
crops
over
but
pay
very
great
reverence
to
it
down
to
my
own
time
then
when
he
had
come
to
acanthos
xerxes
proclaimed
a
with
the
people
of
acanthos
and
also
presented
them
with
the
median
dress
and
commended
them
perceiving
that
they
were
zealous
to
serve
him
in
the
war
and
hearing
of
that
which
had
been
dug
and
while
xerxes
was
in
acanthos
it
happened
that
he
who
had
been
set
over
the
making
of
the
channel
artachaies
by
name
died
of
sickness
a
man
who
was
highly
esteemed
by
xerxes
and
belonged
to
the
achaimenid
family
also
he
was
in
stature
the
tallest
of
all
the
persians
falling
short
by
only
four
fingers
of
being
five
royal
cubits
in
height
and
he
had
a
voice
the
loudest
of
all
men
so
that
xerxes
was
greatly
grieved
at
the
loss
of
him
and
carried
him
forth
and
buried
him
with
great
honour
and
the
whole
army
joined
in
throwing
up
a
mound
for
him
to
this
artachaies
the
acanthians
by
the
bidding
of
an
oracle
do
sacrifice
as
a
hero
calling
upon
his
name
in
worship
king
xerxes
i
say
was
greatly
grieved
at
the
loss
of
artachaies
and
meanwhile
the
hellenes
who
were
entertaining
his
army
and
providing
xerxes
with
dinners
had
been
brought
to
utter
ruin
so
that
they
were
being
driven
from
house
and
home
seeing
that
when
the
thasians
for
example
entertained
the
army
of
xerxes
and
provided
him
with
a
dinner
on
behalf
of
their
towns
upon
the
mainland
antipater
the
son
of
orgeus
who
had
been
appointed
for
this
purpose
a
man
of
repute
among
the
citizens
equal
to
the
best
reported
that
four
hundred
talents
of
silver
had
been
spent
upon
the
dinner
just
so
or
nearly
so
in
the
other
cities
also
those
who
were
set
over
the
business
reported
the
reckoning
to
be
for
the
dinner
was
given
as
follows
having
been
ordered
a
long
time
beforehand
and
being
counted
by
them
a
matter
of
great
importance
in
the
first
place
so
soon
as
they
heard
of
it
from
the
heralds
who
carried
round
the
proclamation
the
citizens
in
the
various
cities
distributed
corn
among
their
several
households
and
all
continued
to
make
wheat
and
barley
meal
for
many
months
then
they
fed
cattle
finding
out
and
obtaining
the
finest
animals
for
a
high
price
and
they
kept
birds
both
of
the
land
and
of
the
water
in
cages
or
in
pools
all
for
the
entertainment
of
the
army
then
again
they
had
and
made
of
gold
and
of
silver
and
all
the
other
things
which
are
placed
upon
the
table
these
were
made
for
the
king
himself
and
for
those
who
ate
at
his
table
but
for
the
rest
of
the
army
only
the
things
appointed
for
food
were
provided
then
whenever
the
army
came
to
any
place
there
was
a
tent
pitched
ready
wherein
xerxes
himself
made
his
stay
while
the
rest
of
the
army
remained
out
in
the
open
air
and
when
it
came
to
be
time
for
dinner
then
the
entertainers
had
labour
but
the
others
after
they
had
been
satiated
with
food
and
had
spent
the
night
there
on
the
next
day
tore
up
the
tent
and
taking
with
them
all
the
movable
furniture
proceeded
on
their
march
leaving
nothing
but
carrying
all
away
with
them
then
was
uttered
a
word
well
spoken
by
megacreon
a
man
of
abdera
who
advised
those
of
abdera
to
go
in
a
body
both
themselves
and
their
wives
to
their
temples
and
to
sit
down
as
suppliants
of
the
gods
entreating
them
that
for
the
future
also
they
would
ward
off
from
them
the
half
of
the
evils
which
threatened
and
he
bade
them
feel
great
thankfulness
to
the
gods
for
the
past
events
because
king
xerxes
had
not
thought
good
to
take
food
twice
in
each
day
for
if
it
had
been
ordered
to
them
beforehand
to
prepare
breakfast
also
in
like
manner
as
the
dinner
it
would
have
remained
for
the
men
of
abdera
either
not
to
await
the
coming
of
xerxes
or
if
they
stayed
to
be
crushed
by
misfortune
more
than
any
other
men
upon
the
earth
they
then
i
say
though
hard
put
to
it
yet
were
performing
that
which
was
appointed
to
them
and
from
acanthos
xerxes
after
having
commanded
the
generals
to
wait
for
the
fleet
at
therma
let
the
ships
take
their
course
apart
from
himself
now
this
therma
is
that
which
is
situated
on
the
thermaic
gulf
from
which
also
this
gulf
has
its
name
and
thus
he
did
because
he
was
informed
that
this
was
the
shortest
way
for
from
doriscos
as
far
as
acanthos
the
army
had
been
making
its
march
thus
xerxes
had
divided
the
whole
into
three
divisions
and
one
of
them
he
had
set
to
go
along
the
sea
accompanying
the
fleet
of
which
division
mardonios
and
masistes
were
commanders
another
third
of
the
army
had
been
appointed
to
go
by
the
inland
way
and
of
this
the
generals
in
command
were
tritantaichmes
and
gergis
and
meanwhile
the
third
of
the
subdivisions
with
which
xerxes
himself
went
marched
in
the
middle
between
them
and
acknowledged
as
its
commanders
smerdomenes
and
megabyzos
the
fleet
when
it
was
let
go
by
xerxes
and
had
sailed
right
through
the
channel
made
in
athos
which
went
across
to
the
gulf
on
which
are
situated
the
cities
of
assa
piloros
singos
and
sarte
having
taken
up
a
contingent
from
these
cities
also
sailed
thence
with
a
free
course
to
the
thermaïc
gulf
and
turning
round
ampelos
the
headland
of
torone
it
left
on
one
side
the
following
hellenic
cities
from
which
it
took
up
contingents
of
ships
and
men
namely
torone
galepsos
sermyle
mekyberna
olynthos
this
region
is
called
sithonia
and
the
fleet
of
xerxes
cutting
across
from
the
headland
of
ampelos
to
that
of
canastron
which
runs
out
furthest
to
sea
of
all
pallene
took
up
there
contingents
of
ships
and
men
from
potidaia
aphytis
neapolis
aige
therambo
skione
mende
and
sane
for
these
are
the
cities
which
occupy
the
region
which
now
is
called
pallene
but
was
formerly
called
phlegra
then
sailing
along
the
coast
of
this
country
also
the
fleet
continued
its
course
towards
the
place
which
has
been
mentioned
before
taking
up
contingents
also
from
the
cities
which
come
next
after
pallene
and
border
upon
the
thermaïc
gulf
and
the
names
of
them
are
these
lipaxos
combreia
lisai
gigonos
campsa
smila
aineia
and
the
region
in
which
these
cities
are
is
called
even
to
the
present
day
crossaia
then
sailing
from
aineia
with
which
name
i
brought
to
an
end
the
list
of
the
cities
at
once
the
fleet
came
into
the
thermaïc
gulf
and
to
the
region
of
mygdonia
and
so
it
arrived
at
the
aforesaid
therma
and
at
the
cities
of
sindos
and
chalestra
upon
the
river
axios
this
river
is
the
boundary
between
the
land
of
mygdonia
and
bottiaia
of
which
district
the
narrow
region
which
lies
on
the
sea
coast
is
occupied
by
the
cities
of
ichnai
and
pella
now
while
his
naval
force
was
encamped
about
the
river
axios
an
the
city
of
therma
and
the
cities
which
lie
between
these
two
waiting
for
the
coming
of
the
king
xerxes
and
the
were
proceeding
from
acanthos
cutting
through
the
middle
by
the
shortest
way
with
a
view
to
reaching
therma
and
he
was
proceeding
through
paionia
and
crestonia
to
the
river
cheidoros
which
beginning
from
the
land
of
the
crestonians
runs
through
the
region
of
mygdonia
and
comes
out
alongside
of
the
marsh
which
is
by
the
river
axios
as
he
was
proceeding
by
this
way
lions
attacked
the
camels
which
carried
his
provisions
for
the
lions
used
to
come
down
regularly
by
night
leaving
their
own
haunts
but
they
touched
nothing
else
neither
beast
of
burden
nor
man
but
killed
the
camels
only
and
i
marvel
what
was
the
cause
and
what
was
it
that
impelled
the
lions
to
abstain
from
all
else
and
to
attack
the
camels
only
creatures
which
they
had
never
seen
before
and
of
which
they
had
had
no
experience
now
there
are
in
these
parts
both
many
lions
and
also
wild
oxen
those
that
have
the
very
large
horns
which
are
often
brought
into
hellas
and
the
limit
within
which
these
lions
are
found
is
on
the
one
side
the
river
nestos
which
flows
through
abdera
and
on
the
other
the
achelos
which
flows
through
acarnania
for
neither
do
the
east
of
the
nestos
in
any
part
of
europe
before
you
come
to
this
would
you
see
a
lion
nor
again
in
the
remaining
part
of
the
continent
to
the
west
of
the
acheloos
but
they
are
produced
in
the
middle
space
between
these
rivers
when
xerxes
had
reached
therma
he
established
the
army
there
and
his
army
encamping
there
occupied
of
the
land
along
by
the
sea
no
less
than
this
beginning
from
the
city
of
therma
and
from
mygdonia
it
extended
as
far
as
the
river
lydias
and
the
haliacmon
which
form
the
boundary
between
the
lands
of
bottiaia
and
macedonia
mingling
their
waters
together
in
one
and
the
same
stream
the
barbarians
i
say
were
encamped
in
these
regions
and
of
the
rivers
which
have
been
enumerated
only
the
river
cheidoros
flowing
from
the
crestonian
land
was
insufficient
for
the
drinking
of
the
army
and
failed
in
its
stream
then
xerxes
seeing
from
therma
the
mountains
of
thessaly
olympos
and
ossa
that
they
were
of
very
great
height
and
being
informed
that
in
the
midst
between
them
there
was
a
narrow
channel
through
which
flows
the
peneios
and
hearing
also
that
by
this
way
there
was
a
good
road
leading
to
thessaly
formed
a
desire
to
sail
thither
and
look
at
the
outlet
of
the
peneios
because
he
was
meaning
to
march
by
the
upper
road
through
the
land
of
the
macedonians
who
dwell
inland
until
he
came
to
the
perraibians
passing
by
the
city
of
gonnos
for
by
this
way
he
was
informed
that
it
was
safest
to
go
and
having
formed
this
desire
so
also
he
proceeded
to
do
that
is
he
embarked
in
a
sidonian
ship
the
same
in
which
he
used
always
to
embark
when
he
wished
to
do
anything
of
this
kind
and
he
displayed
a
signal
for
the
others
to
put
out
to
sea
also
leaving
there
the
then
when
xerxes
had
looked
at
the
outlet
of
the
peneios
he
was
possessed
by
great
wonder
and
summoning
his
guides
he
asked
them
whether
it
was
possible
to
turn
the
river
aside
and
bring
it
out
to
the
sea
by
another
way
now
it
is
said
that
thessaly
was
in
old
time
a
lake
being
enclosed
on
all
sides
by
very
lofty
mountains
for
the
parts
of
it
which
lie
towards
the
east
are
shut
in
by
the
ranges
of
pelion
and
ossa
which
join
one
another
in
their
lower
slopes
the
parts
towards
the
north
wind
by
olympos
those
towards
the
west
by
pindos
and
those
towards
the
and
the
south
wind
by
othrys
and
the
region
in
the
midst
between
these
mountains
which
have
been
named
is
thessaly
forming
as
it
were
a
hollow
whereas
then
many
rivers
flow
into
it
and
among
them
these
five
of
most
note
namely
peneios
apidanos
onochonos
enipeus
and
pamisos
these
which
collect
their
waters
from
the
mountains
that
enclose
thessaly
round
and
flow
into
this
plain
with
names
separate
each
one
having
their
outflow
into
the
sea
by
one
channel
and
that
a
narrow
one
first
mingling
their
waters
all
together
in
one
and
the
same
stream
and
so
soon
as
they
are
mingled
together
from
that
point
onwards
the
peneios
prevails
with
its
name
over
the
rest
and
causes
the
others
to
lose
their
separate
names
and
it
is
said
that
in
ancient
time
there
not
being
yet
this
channel
and
outflow
between
the
mountains
these
rivers
and
besides
these
rivers
the
lake
boibeïs
also
had
no
names
as
they
have
now
but
by
their
waters
they
made
thessaly
to
be
all
sea
the
thessalians
themselves
say
that
poseidon
made
the
channel
through
which
the
peneios
flows
and
reasonably
they
report
it
thus
because
whosoever
believes
that
it
is
poseidon
who
shakes
the
earth
and
that
the
partings
asunder
produced
by
earthquake
are
the
work
of
this
god
would
say
if
he
saw
this
that
it
was
made
by
poseidon
for
the
parting
asunder
of
the
mountains
is
the
work
of
an
earthquake
as
is
evident
to
me
so
the
guides
when
xerxes
asked
whether
there
was
any
other
possible
outlet
to
the
sea
for
the
peneios
said
with
exact
knowledge
of
the
truth
o
king
for
this
river
there
is
no
other
outgoing
which
extends
to
the
sea
but
this
alone
for
all
thessaly
is
circled
about
with
mountains
as
with
a
crown
to
this
xerxes
is
said
to
have
replied
the
thessalians
then
are
prudent
men
this
it
appears
was
that
which
they
desired
to
guard
against
in
good
time
when
they
changed
their
counsel
reflecting
on
this
especially
besides
other
things
namely
that
they
had
a
country
which
it
appears
is
easy
to
conquer
and
may
quickly
be
taken
for
it
would
have
been
necessary
only
to
let
the
river
flow
over
their
land
by
making
an
embankment
to
keep
it
from
going
through
the
narrow
channel
and
so
diverting
the
course
by
which
now
it
flows
in
order
to
put
all
thessaly
under
water
except
the
mountains
this
he
said
in
reference
to
the
sons
of
aleuas
because
they
being
thessalians
were
the
first
of
the
hellenes
who
gave
themselves
over
to
the
king
for
xerxes
thought
that
they
offered
him
friendship
on
behalf
of
their
whole
nation
having
said
thus
and
having
looked
at
the
place
he
sailed
back
to
therma
he
then
was
staying
in
the
region
of
pieria
many
days
for
the
road
over
the
mountains
of
macedonia
was
being
cut
meanwhile
by
a
third
part
of
his
army
that
all
the
host
might
pass
over
by
this
way
into
the
land
of
the
perraibians
and
now
the
heralds
returned
who
had
been
sent
to
hellas
to
demand
the
gift
of
earth
some
and
others
bearing
earth
and
water
and
among
those
who
gave
that
which
was
demanded
were
the
following
namely
the
thessalians
dolopians
enianians
perraibians
locrians
megnesians
malians
achaians
of
phthiotis
and
thebans
with
the
rest
of
the
boeotians
also
excepting
the
thespians
and
plataians
against
these
the
hellenes
who
took
up
war
with
the
barbarian
made
an
oath
and
the
oath
was
this
that
whosoever
being
hellenes
had
given
themselves
over
to
the
persian
not
being
compelled
these
if
their
own
affairs
should
come
to
a
good
conclusion
they
would
dedicate
as
an
offering
to
the
god
at
delphi
thus
ran
the
oath
which
was
taken
by
the
hellenes
xerxes
however
had
not
sent
to
athens
or
to
sparta
heralds
to
demand
the
gift
of
earth
and
for
this
reason
namely
because
at
the
former
time
when
dareios
had
sent
for
this
very
purpose
the
one
people
threw
the
men
who
made
the
demand
into
the
pit
and
the
others
into
a
well
and
bade
them
take
from
thence
earth
and
water
and
bear
them
to
the
king
for
this
reason
xerxes
did
not
send
men
to
make
this
demand
and
what
evil
thing
came
upon
the
athenians
for
having
done
this
to
the
heralds
i
am
not
able
to
say
except
indeed
that
their
land
and
city
were
laid
waste
but
i
do
not
think
that
this
happened
for
that
cause
on
the
lacedemonians
however
the
wrath
fell
of
talthybios
the
herald
of
agamemnon
for
in
sparta
there
is
a
temple
of
talthybios
and
there
are
also
descendants
of
talthybios
called
talthybiads
to
whom
have
been
given
as
a
right
all
the
missions
of
heralds
which
go
from
sparta
and
after
this
event
it
was
not
possible
for
the
spartans
when
they
sacrificed
to
obtain
favourable
omens
this
was
the
case
with
them
for
a
long
time
and
as
the
lacedemonians
were
grieved
and
regarded
it
as
a
great
misfortune
and
general
assemblies
were
repeatedly
gathered
together
and
proclamation
made
asking
if
any
one
of
the
lacedemonians
was
willing
to
die
for
sparta
at
length
sperthias
the
son
of
aneristos
and
bulis
the
son
of
nicolaos
spartans
of
noble
birth
and
in
wealth
attaining
to
the
first
rank
voluntarily
submitted
to
pay
the
penalty
to
xerxes
for
the
heralds
of
dareios
which
had
perished
at
sparta
thus
the
spartans
sent
these
to
the
medes
to
be
put
to
death
and
not
only
the
courage
then
shown
by
these
men
is
worthy
of
admiration
but
also
the
following
sayings
in
addition
for
as
they
were
on
their
way
to
susa
they
came
to
hydarnes
now
hydarnes
was
a
persian
by
race
and
commander
of
those
who
dwelt
on
the
sea
coasts
of
asia
and
he
offered
them
hospitality
and
entertained
them
and
while
they
were
his
guests
he
asked
them
as
follows
lacedemonians
why
is
it
that
ye
flee
from
becoming
friends
to
the
king
for
ye
may
see
that
the
king
knows
how
to
honour
good
men
when
ye
look
at
me
and
at
my
fortunes
so
also
ye
lacedemonians
if
ye
gave
yourselves
to
the
king
since
ye
have
the
reputation
with
him
already
of
being
good
men
would
have
rule
each
one
of
you
over
hellenic
land
by
the
gift
of
the
king
to
this
they
made
answer
thus
hydarnes
thy
counsel
with
regard
to
us
is
not
equally
balanced
for
thou
givest
counsel
having
made
trial
indeed
of
the
one
thing
but
being
without
experience
of
the
other
thou
knowest
well
what
it
is
to
be
a
slave
but
thou
hast
never
yet
made
trial
of
freedom
whether
it
is
pleasant
to
the
taste
or
no
for
if
thou
shouldest
make
trial
of
it
thou
wouldest
then
counsel
us
to
fight
for
it
not
with
spears
only
but
also
with
axes
thus
they
answered
hydarnes
and
then
after
they
had
gone
up
to
susa
and
had
come
into
the
presence
of
the
king
first
when
the
spearmen
of
the
guard
commanded
them
and
endeavoured
to
compel
them
by
force
to
do
obeisance
to
the
king
by
falling
down
before
him
they
said
that
they
would
not
do
any
such
deed
though
they
should
be
pushed
down
by
them
head
foremost
for
it
was
not
their
custom
to
do
obeisance
to
a
man
and
it
was
not
for
this
that
they
had
come
then
when
they
had
resisted
this
next
they
spoke
these
words
or
words
to
this
effect
o
king
of
the
medes
the
lacedemonians
sent
us
in
place
of
the
heralds
who
were
slain
in
sparta
to
pay
the
penalty
for
their
lives
when
they
said
this
xerxes
moved
by
a
spirit
of
magnanimity
replied
that
he
would
not
be
like
the
lacedemonians
for
they
had
violated
the
rules
which
prevailed
among
all
men
by
slaying
heralds
but
he
would
not
do
that
himself
which
he
blamed
them
for
having
done
nor
would
he
free
the
lacedemonians
from
their
guilt
by
slaying
these
in
return
thus
the
wrath
of
talthybios
ceased
for
the
time
being
even
though
the
spartans
had
done
no
more
than
this
and
although
sperthias
and
bulis
returned
back
to
sparta
but
a
long
time
after
this
it
was
roused
again
during
the
war
between
the
peloponnesians
and
athenians
as
the
lacedemonians
report
this
i
perceive
to
have
been
most
evidently
the
act
of
the
deity
for
in
that
the
wrath
of
talthybios
fell
upon
messengers
and
did
not
cease
until
it
had
been
fully
satisfied
so
much
was
but
in
accordance
with
justice
but
that
it
happened
to
come
upon
the
sons
of
these
men
who
went
up
to
the
king
on
account
of
the
wrath
namely
upon
nicolaos
the
son
of
bulis
and
aneristos
the
son
of
sperthias
the
same
who
conquered
the
men
of
halieis
who
came
from
tiryns
by
sailing
into
their
harbour
with
a
merchant
ship
filled
with
fighting
men
by
this
it
is
evident
to
me
that
the
matter
came
to
pass
by
the
act
of
the
deity
caused
by
this
wrath
for
these
men
sent
by
the
lacedemonians
as
envoys
to
asia
having
been
betrayed
by
sitalkes
the
son
of
teres
king
of
the
thracians
and
by
nymphodoros
the
son
of
pythes
a
man
of
abdera
were
captured
at
bisanthe
on
the
hellespont
and
then
having
been
carried
away
to
attica
they
were
put
to
death
by
the
athenians
and
with
them
also
aristeas
the
son
of
adeimantos
the
corinthian
these
things
happened
many
years
after
the
expedition
of
the
king
and
i
return
now
to
the
former
narrative
now
the
march
of
the
king
army
was
in
name
against
athens
but
in
fact
it
was
going
against
all
hellas
and
the
hellenes
being
informed
of
this
long
before
were
not
all
equally
affected
by
it
for
some
of
them
having
given
earth
and
water
to
the
persian
had
confidence
supposing
that
they
would
suffer
no
hurt
from
the
barbarian
while
others
not
having
given
were
in
great
terror
seeing
that
there
were
not
ships
existing
in
hellas
which
were
capable
as
regards
number
of
receiving
the
invader
in
fight
and
seeing
that
the
greater
part
of
the
states
were
not
willing
to
take
up
the
war
but
adopted
readily
the
side
of
the
medes
and
here
i
am
compelled
by
necessity
to
declare
an
opinion
which
in
the
eyes
of
most
men
would
seem
to
be
invidious
but
nevertheless
i
will
not
abstain
from
saying
that
which
i
see
evidently
to
be
the
truth
if
the
athenians
had
been
seized
with
fear
of
the
danger
which
threatened
them
and
had
left
their
land
or
again
without
leaving
their
land
had
stayed
and
given
themselves
up
to
xerxes
none
would
have
made
any
attempt
by
sea
to
oppose
the
king
if
then
none
had
opposed
xerxes
by
sea
it
would
have
happened
on
the
land
somewhat
thus
even
if
many
tunics
of
walls
had
been
thrown
across
the
isthmus
by
the
peloponnesians
the
lacedemonians
would
have
been
deserted
by
their
allies
not
voluntarily
but
of
necessity
since
these
would
have
been
conquered
city
after
city
by
the
naval
force
of
the
barbarian
and
so
they
would
have
been
left
alone
and
having
been
left
alone
and
having
displayed
great
deeds
of
valour
they
would
have
met
their
death
nobly
either
they
would
have
suffered
this
fate
or
before
this
seeing
the
other
hellenes
also
taking
the
side
of
the
medes
they
would
have
made
an
agreement
with
xerxes
and
thus
in
either
case
hellas
would
have
come
to
be
under
the
rule
of
the
persians
for
as
to
the
good
to
be
got
from
the
walls
thrown
across
the
isthmus
i
am
unable
to
discover
what
it
would
have
been
when
the
king
had
command
of
the
sea
as
it
is
however
if
a
man
should
say
that
the
athenians
proved
to
be
the
saviours
of
hellas
he
would
not
fail
to
hit
the
truth
for
to
whichever
side
these
turned
to
that
the
balance
was
likely
to
incline
and
these
were
they
who
preferring
that
hellas
should
continue
to
exist
in
freedom
roused
up
all
of
hellas
which
remained
so
much
that
is
as
had
not
gone
over
to
the
medes
and
after
the
gods
at
least
these
were
they
who
repelled
the
king
nor
did
fearful
oracles
which
came
from
delphi
and
cast
them
into
dread
induce
them
to
leave
hellas
but
they
stayed
behind
and
endured
to
receive
the
invader
of
their
land
for
the
athenians
had
sent
men
to
delphi
to
inquire
and
were
preparing
to
consult
the
oracle
and
after
these
had
performed
the
usual
rites
in
the
sacred
precincts
when
they
had
entered
the
sanctuary
and
were
sitting
down
there
the
pythian
prophetess
whose
name
was
aristonike
uttered
to
them
this
oracle
why
do
ye
sit
o
ye
wretched
flee
thou
to
the
uttermost
limits
leaving
thy
home
and
the
heights
of
the
city
behind
thee
lo
there
remaineth
now
nor
the
head
nor
the
body
in
safety
neither
the
feet
below
nor
the
hands
nor
the
middle
are
left
thee
all
are
destroyed
together
for
fire
and
the
passionate
urging
the
syrian
car
to
speed
doth
hurl
them
to
ruin
not
thine
alone
he
shall
cause
many
more
great
strongholds
to
perish
yes
many
temples
of
gods
to
the
ravening
fire
shall
deliver
temples
which
stand
now
surely
with
sweat
of
their
terror
quaking
with
dread
and
lo
from
the
topmost
roof
to
the
pavement
dark
blood
trickles
forecasting
the
dire
unavoidable
evil
forth
with
you
forth
from
the
shrine
and
steep
your
soul
in
the
sorrow
hearing
this
the
men
who
had
been
sent
by
the
athenians
to
consult
the
oracle
were
very
greatly
distressed
and
as
they
were
despairing
by
reason
of
the
evil
which
had
been
prophesied
to
them
timon
the
son
of
androbulos
a
man
of
the
delphians
in
reputation
equal
to
the
first
counselled
them
to
take
a
suppliant
bough
and
to
approach
the
second
time
and
consult
the
oracle
as
suppliants
the
athenians
did
as
he
advised
and
said
lord
we
pray
thee
utter
to
us
some
better
oracle
about
our
native
land
having
respect
to
these
suppliant
boughs
which
we
have
come
to
thee
bearing
otherwise
surely
we
will
not
depart
away
from
the
sanctuary
but
will
remain
here
where
we
are
now
even
until
we
bring
our
lives
to
an
end
when
they
spoke
these
words
the
prophetess
gave
them
a
second
oracle
as
follows
pallas
can
not
prevail
to
appease
great
zeus
in
olympos
though
she
with
words
very
many
and
wiles
entreat
him
but
i
will
tell
thee
this
more
and
will
clench
it
with
steel
adamantine
then
when
all
else
shall
be
taken
whatever
the
boundary
of
kecrops
holdeth
within
and
the
dark
ravines
of
divinest
kithairon
a
bulwark
of
wood
at
the
last
zeus
grants
to
the
goddess
sole
to
remain
unwasted
which
thee
and
thy
children
shall
profit
stay
thou
not
there
for
the
horsemen
to
come
and
the
footmen
unnumbered
stay
thou
not
still
for
the
host
from
the
mainland
to
come
but
retire
thee
turning
thy
back
to
the
foe
for
yet
thou
shalt
face
him
hereafter
salamis
thou
the
divine
thou
shalt
cause
sons
of
women
to
perish
or
when
the
grain
is
scattered
or
when
it
is
gathered
together
this
seemed
to
them
to
be
as
in
truth
it
was
a
milder
utterance
than
the
former
one
therefore
they
had
it
written
down
and
departed
with
it
to
athens
and
when
the
messengers
after
their
return
made
report
to
the
people
many
various
opinions
were
expressed
by
persons
inquiring
into
the
meaning
of
the
oracle
and
among
them
these
standing
most
in
opposition
to
one
another
some
of
the
elder
men
said
they
thought
that
the
god
had
prophesied
to
them
that
the
acropolis
should
survive
for
the
acropolis
of
the
athenians
was
in
old
time
fenced
with
a
thorn
hedge
and
they
conjectured
accordingly
that
this
saying
about
the
bulwark
of
wood
referred
to
the
fence
others
on
the
contrary
said
that
the
god
meant
by
this
their
ships
and
they
advised
to
leave
all
else
and
get
ready
these
now
they
who
said
that
the
ships
were
the
bulwark
of
wood
were
shaken
in
their
interpretation
by
the
two
last
verses
which
the
prophetess
uttered
salamis
thou
the
divine
thou
shalt
cause
sons
of
women
to
perish
or
when
the
grain
is
scattered
or
when
it
is
gathered
together
in
reference
to
these
verses
the
opinions
of
those
who
said
that
the
ships
were
the
bulwark
of
wood
were
disturbed
for
the
interpreters
of
oracles
took
these
to
mean
that
it
was
fated
for
them
having
got
ready
for
a
to
suffer
defeat
round
about
salamis
now
there
was
one
man
of
the
athenians
who
had
lately
been
coming
forward
to
take
a
place
among
the
first
whose
name
was
themistocles
called
son
of
neocles
this
man
said
that
the
interpreters
of
oracles
did
not
make
right
conjecture
of
the
whole
and
he
spoke
as
follows
saying
that
if
these
words
that
had
been
uttered
referred
really
to
the
athenians
he
did
not
think
it
would
have
been
so
mildly
expressed
in
the
oracle
but
rather
thus
salamis
thou
the
merciless
instead
of
salamis
thou
the
divine
at
least
if
its
settlers
were
destined
to
perish
round
about
it
but
in
truth
the
oracle
had
been
spoken
by
the
god
with
reference
to
the
enemy
if
one
understood
it
rightly
and
not
to
the
athenians
therefore
he
counselled
them
to
get
ready
to
fight
a
battle
by
sea
for
in
this
was
their
bulwark
of
wood
when
themistocles
declared
his
opinion
thus
the
athenians
judged
that
this
was
to
be
preferred
by
them
rather
than
the
advice
of
the
interpreters
of
oracles
who
bade
them
not
make
ready
for
a
nor
in
short
raise
their
hands
at
all
in
opposition
but
leave
the
land
of
attica
and
settle
in
some
other
another
opinion
too
of
themistocles
before
this
one
proved
the
best
at
the
right
moment
when
the
athenians
having
got
large
sums
of
money
in
the
public
treasury
which
had
come
in
to
them
from
the
mines
which
are
at
laureion
were
intending
to
share
it
among
themselves
taking
each
in
turn
the
sum
of
ten
drachmas
then
themistocles
persuaded
the
athenians
to
give
up
this
plan
of
division
and
to
make
for
themselves
with
this
money
two
hundred
ships
for
the
war
meaning
by
that
the
war
with
the
eginetans
for
this
war
having
arisen
proved
in
fact
the
salvation
of
hellas
at
that
time
by
compelling
the
athenians
to
become
a
naval
power
and
the
ships
not
having
been
used
for
the
purpose
for
which
they
had
been
made
thus
proved
of
service
at
need
to
hellas
these
ships
then
i
say
the
athenians
had
already
having
built
them
beforehand
and
it
was
necessary
in
addition
to
these
to
construct
others
they
resolved
then
when
they
took
counsel
after
the
oracle
was
given
to
receive
the
barbarian
invading
hellas
with
their
ships
in
full
force
following
the
commands
of
the
god
in
combination
with
those
of
the
hellenes
who
were
willing
to
join
them
these
oracles
had
been
given
before
to
the
athenians
and
when
those
hellenes
who
had
the
better
mind
about
hellas
came
together
to
one
place
and
considered
their
affairs
and
interchanged
assurances
with
one
another
then
deliberating
together
they
thought
it
well
first
of
all
things
to
reconcile
the
enmities
and
bring
to
an
end
the
wars
which
they
had
with
one
another
now
there
were
wars
engaged
between
others
also
and
especially
between
the
athenians
and
the
eginetans
after
this
being
informed
that
xerxes
was
with
his
army
at
sardis
they
determined
to
send
spies
to
asia
to
make
observation
of
the
power
of
the
king
and
moreover
they
resolved
to
send
envoys
to
argos
to
form
an
alliance
against
the
persian
and
to
send
others
to
sicily
to
gelon
the
son
of
deinomenes
and
also
to
corcyra
to
urge
them
to
come
to
the
assistance
of
hellas
and
others
again
to
crete
for
they
made
it
their
aim
that
if
possible
the
hellenic
race
might
unite
in
one
and
that
they
might
join
all
together
and
act
towards
the
same
end
since
dangers
were
threatening
all
the
hellenes
equally
now
the
power
of
gelon
was
said
to
be
great
far
greater
than
any
other
hellenic
power
when
they
had
thus
resolved
they
reconciled
their
enmities
and
then
sent
first
three
men
as
spies
to
asia
these
having
come
to
sardis
and
having
got
knowledge
about
the
king
army
were
discovered
and
after
having
been
examined
by
the
generals
of
the
were
being
led
off
to
die
for
these
men
i
say
death
had
been
determined
but
xerxes
being
informed
of
this
found
fault
with
the
decision
of
the
generals
and
sent
some
of
the
spearmen
of
his
guard
enjoining
them
if
they
should
find
the
spies
yet
alive
to
bring
them
to
his
presence
so
having
found
them
yet
surviving
they
brought
them
into
the
presence
of
the
king
and
upon
that
xerxes
being
informed
for
what
purpose
they
had
come
commanded
the
spearmen
to
lead
them
round
and
to
show
them
the
whole
army
both
foot
and
horse
and
when
they
should
have
had
their
fill
of
looking
at
these
things
to
let
them
go
unhurt
to
whatsoever
land
they
desired
such
was
the
command
which
he
gave
adding
at
the
same
time
this
saying
namely
that
if
the
spies
had
been
put
to
death
the
hellenes
would
not
have
been
informed
beforehand
of
his
power
how
far
beyond
description
it
was
while
on
the
other
hand
by
putting
to
death
three
men
they
would
not
very
greatly
have
damaged
the
enemy
but
when
these
returned
back
to
hellas
he
thought
it
likely
that
the
hellenes
hearing
of
his
power
would
deliver
up
their
freedom
to
him
themselves
before
the
expedition
took
place
which
was
being
set
in
motion
and
thus
there
would
be
no
need
for
them
to
have
the
labour
of
marching
an
army
against
them
this
opinion
of
his
is
like
his
manner
of
thinking
at
other
times
for
when
xerxes
was
in
abydos
he
saw
vessels
which
carried
corn
from
the
pontus
sailing
out
through
the
hellespont
on
their
way
to
egina
and
the
peloponnese
those
then
who
sat
by
his
side
being
informed
that
the
ships
belonged
to
the
enemy
were
prepared
to
capture
them
and
were
looking
to
the
king
to
see
when
he
would
give
the
word
but
xerxes
asked
about
them
whither
the
men
were
sailing
and
they
replied
master
to
thy
foes
conveying
to
them
corn
he
then
made
answer
and
said
are
we
not
also
sailing
to
the
same
place
as
these
men
furnished
with
corn
as
well
as
with
other
things
necessary
how
then
do
these
wrong
us
since
they
are
conveying
provisions
for
our
use
the
spies
then
having
thus
looked
at
everything
and
after
that
having
been
dismissed
returned
back
to
europe
and
meanwhile
those
of
the
hellenes
who
had
sworn
alliance
against
the
persian
after
the
sending
forth
of
the
spies
proceeded
to
send
envoys
next
to
argos
now
the
argives
report
that
the
matters
concerning
themselves
took
place
as
follows
they
were
informed
they
say
at
the
very
first
of
the
movement
which
was
being
set
on
foot
by
the
barbarian
against
hellas
and
having
been
informed
of
this
and
perceiving
that
the
hellenes
would
endeavour
to
get
their
alliance
against
the
persians
they
had
sent
messengers
to
inquire
of
the
god
at
delphi
and
to
ask
how
they
should
act
in
order
that
it
might
be
best
for
themselves
because
lately
there
had
been
slain
of
them
six
thousand
men
by
the
lacedemonians
and
by
cleomenes
the
son
of
anaxandrides
and
this
in
fact
was
the
reason
that
they
were
sending
to
inquire
and
when
they
inquired
the
pythian
prophetess
made
answer
to
them
as
follows
thou
to
thy
neighbours
a
foe
by
the
gods
immortal
beloved
keep
thou
thy
spear
within
bounds
and
sit
behind
it
guard
well
the
head
and
the
head
shall
preserve
the
limbs
and
the
body
thus
they
say
the
pythian
prophetess
had
replied
to
them
before
this
and
afterwards
when
the
messengers
of
the
hellenes
came
as
i
said
to
argos
they
entered
the
and
spoke
that
which
had
been
enjoined
to
them
and
to
that
which
was
said
the
council
replied
that
the
argives
were
ready
to
do
as
they
were
requested
on
condition
that
they
got
peace
made
with
the
lacedemonians
for
thirty
years
and
that
they
had
half
the
leadership
of
the
whole
confederacy
and
yet
by
strict
right
they
said
the
whole
leadership
fell
to
their
share
but
nevertheless
it
was
sufficient
for
them
to
have
half
thus
they
report
that
the
council
made
answer
although
the
oracle
forbade
them
to
make
the
alliance
with
the
hellenes
and
they
were
anxious
they
say
that
a
truce
from
hostilities
for
thirty
years
should
be
made
although
they
feared
the
oracle
in
order
as
they
allege
that
their
sons
might
grow
to
manhood
in
these
years
whereas
if
a
truce
did
not
exist
they
had
fear
that
supposing
another
disaster
should
come
upon
them
in
fighting
against
the
persian
in
addition
to
that
which
had
befallen
them
already
they
might
be
for
all
future
time
subject
to
the
lacedemonians
to
that
which
was
spoken
by
the
council
those
of
the
envoys
who
were
of
sparta
replied
that
as
to
the
truce
they
would
refer
the
matter
to
their
public
assembly
but
as
to
the
leadership
they
had
themselves
been
commissioned
to
make
reply
and
did
in
fact
say
this
namely
that
they
had
two
kings
while
the
argives
had
one
and
it
was
not
possible
to
remove
either
of
the
two
who
were
of
sparta
from
the
leadership
but
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
the
argive
king
from
having
an
equal
vote
with
each
of
their
two
then
say
the
argives
they
could
not
endure
the
grasping
selfishness
of
the
spartans
but
chose
to
be
ruled
by
the
barbarians
rather
than
to
yield
at
all
to
the
lacedemonians
and
they
gave
notice
to
the
envoys
to
depart
out
of
the
territory
of
the
argives
before
sunset
or
if
not
they
would
be
dealt
with
as
enemies
the
argives
themselves
report
so
much
about
these
matters
but
there
is
another
story
reported
in
hellas
to
the
effect
that
xerxes
sent
a
herald
to
argos
before
he
set
forth
to
make
an
expedition
against
hellas
and
this
herald
they
say
when
he
had
come
spoke
as
follows
men
of
argos
king
xerxes
says
to
you
these
things
we
hold
that
perses
from
whom
we
are
descended
was
the
son
of
perseus
the
son
of
danae
and
was
born
of
the
daughter
of
kepheus
andromeda
and
according
to
this
it
would
seem
that
we
are
descended
from
you
it
is
not
fitting
then
that
we
should
go
forth
on
an
expedition
against
those
from
whom
we
trace
our
descent
nor
that
ye
should
set
yourselves
in
opposition
to
us
by
rendering
assistance
to
others
but
it
is
fitting
that
ye
keep
still
and
remain
by
yourselves
for
if
things
happen
according
to
my
mind
i
shall
not
esteem
any
people
to
be
of
greater
consequence
than
you
having
heard
this
the
argives
it
is
said
considered
it
a
great
matter
and
therefore
at
first
they
made
no
offer
of
help
nor
did
they
ask
for
any
share
but
afterwards
when
the
hellenes
tried
to
get
them
on
their
side
then
since
they
knew
well
that
the
lacedemonians
would
not
give
them
a
share
in
the
command
they
asked
for
this
merely
in
order
that
they
might
have
a
pretext
for
remaining
still
also
some
of
the
hellenes
report
that
the
following
event
in
agreement
with
this
account
came
to
pass
many
years
after
these
things
there
happened
they
say
to
be
in
susa
the
city
of
memnon
envoys
of
the
athenians
come
about
some
other
matter
namely
callias
the
son
of
hipponicos
and
the
others
who
went
up
with
him
and
the
argives
at
that
very
time
had
also
sent
envoys
to
susa
and
these
asked
artoxerxes
the
son
of
xerxes
whether
the
friendship
which
they
had
formed
with
xerxes
still
remained
unbroken
if
they
themselves
desired
to
maintain
it
or
whether
they
were
esteemed
by
him
to
be
enemies
and
king
artoxerxes
said
that
it
most
certainly
remained
unbroken
and
that
there
was
no
city
which
he
considered
to
be
more
his
friend
than
argos
now
whether
xerxes
did
indeed
send
a
herald
to
argos
saying
that
which
has
been
reported
and
whether
envoys
of
the
argives
who
had
gone
up
to
susa
inquired
of
artoxerxes
concerning
friendship
i
am
not
able
to
say
for
certain
nor
do
i
declare
any
opinion
about
the
matters
in
question
other
than
that
which
the
argives
themselves
report
but
i
know
this
much
that
if
all
the
nations
of
men
should
bring
together
into
one
place
the
evils
which
they
have
suffered
themselves
desiring
to
make
exchange
with
their
neighbours
each
people
of
them
when
they
had
examined
closely
the
evils
suffered
by
their
fellows
would
gladly
carry
away
back
with
them
those
which
they
had
brought
thus
it
is
not
the
argives
who
have
acted
most
basely
of
all
i
however
am
bound
to
report
that
which
is
reported
though
i
am
not
bound
altogether
to
believe
it
and
let
this
saying
be
considered
to
hold
good
as
regards
every
narrative
in
the
history
for
i
must
add
that
this
also
is
reported
namely
that
the
argives
were
actually
those
who
invited
the
persian
to
invade
hellas
because
their
war
with
the
lacedemonians
had
had
an
evil
issue
being
willing
to
suffer
anything
whatever
rather
than
the
trouble
which
was
then
upon
them
that
which
concerns
the
argives
has
now
been
said
and
meanwhile
envoys
had
come
to
sicily
from
the
allies
to
confer
with
gelon
among
whom
was
also
syagros
from
the
lacedemonians
now
the
ancestor
of
this
gelon
he
who
was
at
gela
as
a
settler
was
a
native
of
the
island
of
telos
which
lies
off
triopion
and
when
gela
was
founded
by
the
lindians
of
rhodes
and
by
antiphemos
he
was
not
left
behind
then
in
course
of
time
his
descendants
became
and
continued
to
be
priests
of
the
mysteries
of
the
earth
goddesses
an
office
which
was
acquired
by
telines
one
of
their
ancestors
in
the
following
manner
certain
of
the
men
of
gela
being
worsted
in
a
party
struggle
had
fled
to
mactorion
the
city
which
stands
above
gela
these
men
telines
brought
back
to
gela
from
exile
with
no
force
of
men
but
only
with
the
sacred
rites
of
these
goddesses
but
from
whom
he
received
them
or
whether
he
obtained
them
for
himself
this
i
am
not
able
to
say
trusting
in
these
however
he
brought
the
men
back
from
exile
on
the
condition
that
his
descendants
should
be
priests
of
the
mysteries
of
the
goddesses
to
me
it
has
caused
wonder
also
that
telines
should
have
been
able
to
perform
so
great
a
deed
considering
that
which
i
am
told
for
such
deeds
i
think
are
not
apt
to
proceed
from
every
man
but
from
one
who
has
a
brave
spirit
and
manly
vigour
whereas
telines
is
said
by
the
dwellers
in
sicily
to
have
been
on
the
contrary
a
man
of
effeminate
character
and
rather
poor
spirit
he
then
had
thus
obtained
the
privilege
of
which
i
speak
and
when
cleander
the
son
of
pantares
brought
his
life
to
an
end
having
been
despot
of
gela
for
seven
years
and
being
killed
at
last
by
sabyllos
a
man
of
gela
then
hippocrates
succeeded
to
the
monarchy
who
was
brother
of
cleander
and
while
hippocrates
was
despot
gelon
who
was
a
descendant
of
telines
the
priest
of
the
mysteries
was
spearman
of
the
guard
to
hippocrates
with
many
others
and
among
them
ainesidemos
the
son
of
pataicos
then
after
no
long
time
he
was
appointed
by
reason
of
valour
to
be
commander
of
the
whole
cavalry
for
when
hippocrates
besieged
successively
the
cities
of
callipolis
naxos
zancle
leontini
and
also
syracuse
and
many
towns
of
the
barbarians
in
these
wars
gelon
showed
himself
a
most
brilliant
warrior
and
of
the
cities
which
i
just
now
mentioned
not
one
except
syracuse
escaped
being
reduced
to
subjection
by
hippocrates
the
syracusans
however
after
they
had
been
defeated
in
battle
at
the
river
eloros
were
rescued
by
the
corinthians
and
corcyreans
these
rescued
them
and
brought
the
quarrel
to
a
settlement
on
this
condition
namely
that
the
syracusans
should
deliver
up
camarina
to
hippocrates
now
camarina
used
in
ancient
time
to
belong
to
the
men
of
syracuse
then
when
it
was
the
fate
of
hippocrates
also
after
having
been
despot
for
the
same
number
of
years
as
his
brother
cleander
to
be
killed
at
the
city
of
hybla
whither
he
had
gone
on
an
expedition
against
the
sikelians
then
gelon
made
a
pretence
of
helping
the
sons
of
hippocrates
eucleides
and
cleander
when
the
citizens
were
no
longer
willing
to
submit
but
actually
when
he
had
been
victorious
in
a
battle
over
the
men
of
gela
he
robbed
the
sons
of
hippocrates
of
the
power
and
was
ruler
himself
after
this
stroke
of
fortune
gelon
restored
those
of
the
syracusans
who
were
called
after
they
had
been
driven
into
exile
by
the
common
people
and
by
their
own
slaves
who
were
called
kyllyrians
these
i
say
he
restored
from
the
city
of
casmene
to
syracuse
and
so
got
possession
of
this
last
city
also
for
the
common
people
of
syracuse
when
gelon
came
against
them
delivered
up
to
him
their
city
and
themselves
so
after
he
had
received
syracuse
into
his
power
he
made
less
account
of
gela
of
which
he
was
ruler
also
in
addition
and
he
gave
it
in
charge
to
hieron
his
brother
while
he
proceeded
to
strengthen
syracuse
so
forthwith
that
city
rose
and
shot
up
to
prosperity
for
in
the
first
place
he
brought
all
those
of
camarina
to
syracuse
and
made
them
citizens
and
razed
to
the
ground
the
city
of
camarina
then
secondly
he
did
the
same
to
more
than
half
of
the
men
of
gela
as
he
had
done
to
those
of
camarina
and
as
regards
the
megarians
of
sicily
when
they
were
besieged
and
had
surrendered
by
capitulation
the
men
of
them
though
they
had
stirred
up
war
with
him
and
expected
to
be
put
to
death
for
this
reason
he
brought
to
syracuse
and
made
them
citizens
but
the
common
people
of
the
megarians
who
had
no
share
in
the
guilt
of
this
war
and
did
not
expect
that
they
would
suffer
any
evil
these
also
he
brought
to
syracuse
and
sold
them
as
slaves
to
be
carried
away
from
sicily
and
the
same
thing
he
did
moreover
to
the
men
of
euboia
in
sicily
making
a
distinction
between
them
and
he
dealt
thus
with
these
two
cities
because
he
thought
that
a
body
of
commons
was
a
most
unpleasant
element
in
the
state
in
the
manner
then
which
has
been
described
gelon
had
become
a
powerful
despot
and
at
this
time
when
the
envoys
of
the
hellenes
had
arrived
at
syracuse
they
came
to
speech
with
him
and
said
as
follows
the
lacedemonians
and
their
allies
sent
us
to
get
thee
to
be
on
our
side
against
the
barbarian
for
we
suppose
that
thou
art
certainly
informed
of
him
who
is
about
to
invade
hellas
namely
that
a
persian
is
designing
to
bridge
over
the
hellespont
and
to
make
an
expedition
against
hellas
leading
against
us
out
of
asia
all
the
armies
of
the
east
under
colour
of
marching
upon
athens
but
in
fact
meaning
to
bring
all
hellas
to
subjection
under
him
do
thou
therefore
seeing
that
thou
hast
attained
to
a
great
power
and
hast
no
small
portion
of
hellas
for
thy
share
being
the
ruler
of
sicily
come
to
the
assistance
of
those
who
are
endeavouring
to
free
hellas
and
join
in
making
her
free
for
if
all
hellas
be
gathered
together
in
one
it
forms
a
great
body
and
we
are
made
a
match
in
fight
for
those
who
are
coming
against
us
but
if
some
of
us
go
over
to
the
enemy
and
others
are
not
willing
to
help
and
the
sound
portion
of
hellas
is
consequently
small
there
is
at
once
in
this
a
danger
that
all
hellas
may
fall
to
ruin
for
do
not
thou
hope
that
if
the
persian
shall
overcome
us
in
battle
he
will
not
come
to
thee
but
guard
thyself
against
this
beforehand
for
in
coming
to
our
assistance
thou
art
helping
thyself
and
the
matter
which
is
wisely
planned
has
for
the
most
part
a
good
issue
afterwards
the
envoys
spoke
thus
and
gelon
was
very
vehement
with
them
speaking
to
them
as
follows
hellenes
a
selfish
speech
is
this
with
which
ye
have
ventured
to
come
and
invite
me
to
be
your
ally
against
the
barbarian
whereas
ye
yourselves
when
i
in
former
time
requested
of
you
to
join
with
me
in
fighting
against
an
army
of
barbarians
contention
having
arisen
between
me
and
the
carthaginians
and
when
i
charged
you
to
exact
vengeance
of
the
men
of
egesta
for
the
death
of
dorieos
the
son
of
anaxandrides
while
at
the
same
time
i
offered
to
help
in
setting
free
the
from
which
great
advantages
and
gains
have
been
reaped
by
you
ye
i
say
then
neither
for
my
own
sake
came
to
my
assistance
nor
in
order
to
exact
vengeance
for
the
death
of
dorieos
and
so
far
as
ye
are
concerned
all
these
parts
are
even
now
under
the
rule
of
barbarians
but
since
it
turned
out
well
for
us
and
came
to
a
better
issue
now
that
the
war
has
come
round
and
reached
you
there
has
at
last
arisen
in
your
minds
a
recollection
of
gelon
however
though
i
have
met
with
contempt
at
your
hands
i
will
not
act
like
you
but
i
am
prepared
to
come
to
your
assistance
supplying
two
hundred
triremes
and
twenty
thousand
hoplites
with
two
thousand
horsemen
two
thousand
bowmen
two
thousand
slingers
and
two
thousand
men
to
run
beside
the
horsemen
and
moreover
i
will
undertake
to
supply
corn
for
the
whole
army
of
the
hellenes
until
we
have
finished
the
war
these
things
i
engage
to
supply
on
this
condition
namely
that
i
shall
be
commander
and
leader
of
the
hellenes
against
the
barbarian
but
on
any
other
condition
i
will
neither
come
myself
nor
will
i
send
others
hearing
this
syagros
could
not
contain
himself
but
spoke
these
words
deeply
i
trow
would
agamemnon
son
of
pelops
lament
if
he
heard
that
the
spartans
had
had
the
leadership
taken
away
from
them
by
gelon
and
by
the
syracusans
nay
but
make
thou
no
further
mention
of
this
condition
namely
that
we
should
deliver
the
leadership
to
thee
but
if
thou
art
desirous
to
come
to
the
assistance
of
hellas
know
that
thou
wilt
be
under
the
command
of
the
lacedemonians
and
if
thou
dost
indeed
claim
not
to
be
under
command
come
not
thou
to
our
help
at
all
to
this
gelon
seeing
that
the
speech
of
syagros
was
adverse
set
forth
to
them
his
last
proposal
thus
stranger
from
sparta
reproaches
sinking
into
the
heart
of
a
man
are
wont
to
rouse
his
spirit
in
anger
against
them
thou
however
though
thou
hast
uttered
insults
against
me
in
thy
speech
wilt
not
bring
me
to
show
myself
unseemly
in
my
reply
but
whereas
ye
so
strongly
lay
claim
to
the
leadership
it
were
fitting
that
i
should
lay
claim
to
it
more
than
ye
seeing
that
i
am
the
leader
of
an
army
many
times
as
large
and
of
ships
many
more
since
however
this
condition
is
so
distasteful
to
you
we
will
recede
somewhat
from
our
former
proposal
suppose
that
ye
should
be
leaders
of
the
and
i
of
the
fleet
or
if
it
pleases
you
to
lead
the
i
am
willing
to
be
leader
of
those
on
land
and
either
ye
must
be
contented
with
these
terms
or
go
away
without
the
alliance
which
i
have
to
give
gelon
i
say
made
these
offers
and
the
envoy
of
the
athenians
answering
before
that
of
the
lacedemonians
replied
to
him
as
follows
o
king
of
the
syracusans
it
was
not
of
a
leader
that
hellas
was
in
want
when
it
sent
us
to
thee
but
of
an
army
thou
however
dost
not
set
before
us
the
hope
that
thou
wilt
send
an
army
except
thou
have
the
leadership
of
hellas
and
thou
art
striving
how
thou
mayest
become
commander
of
the
armies
of
hellas
so
long
then
as
it
was
thy
demand
to
be
leader
of
the
whole
army
of
the
hellenes
it
was
sufficient
for
us
athenians
to
keep
silence
knowing
that
the
lacedemonian
would
be
able
to
make
defence
even
for
us
both
but
now
since
being
repulsed
from
the
demand
for
the
whole
thou
art
requesting
to
be
commander
of
the
naval
force
we
tell
that
thus
it
is
not
even
if
the
lacedemonian
shall
permit
thee
to
be
commander
of
it
will
we
permit
thee
for
this
at
least
is
our
own
if
the
lacedemonians
do
not
themselves
desire
to
have
it
with
these
if
they
desire
to
be
the
leaders
we
do
not
contend
but
none
others
beside
ourselves
shall
we
permit
to
be
in
command
of
the
ships
for
then
to
no
purpose
should
we
be
possessors
of
a
larger
than
any
other
which
belongs
to
the
hellenes
if
being
athenians
we
should
yield
the
leadership
to
syracusans
we
who
boast
of
a
race
which
is
the
most
ancient
of
all
and
who
are
of
all
the
hellenes
the
only
people
who
have
not
changed
from
one
land
to
another
to
whom
also
belonged
a
man
whom
homer
the
epic
poet
said
was
the
best
of
all
who
came
to
ilion
in
drawing
up
an
army
and
setting
it
in
array
thus
we
are
not
justly
to
be
reproached
if
we
say
these
things
to
this
gelon
made
answer
thus
stranger
of
athens
it
would
seem
that
ye
have
the
commanders
but
that
ye
will
not
have
the
men
to
be
commanded
since
then
ye
will
not
at
all
give
way
but
desire
to
have
the
whole
it
were
well
that
ye
should
depart
home
as
quickly
as
possible
and
report
to
the
hellenes
that
the
spring
has
been
taken
out
of
their
year
now
this
is
the
meaning
of
the
saying
evidently
the
spring
is
the
noblest
part
of
the
year
and
so
he
meant
to
say
that
his
army
was
the
noblest
part
of
the
army
of
the
hellenes
for
hellas
therefore
deprived
of
his
alliance
it
was
he
said
as
if
the
spring
had
been
taken
out
of
the
year
the
envoys
of
the
hellenes
having
thus
had
conference
with
gelon
sailed
away
and
gelon
upon
this
fearing
on
the
one
hand
about
the
hellenes
lest
they
should
not
be
able
to
overcome
the
barbarian
and
on
the
other
hand
considering
it
monstrous
and
not
to
be
endured
that
he
should
come
to
peloponnesus
and
be
under
the
command
of
the
lacedemonians
seeing
that
he
was
despot
of
sicily
gave
up
the
thought
of
this
way
and
followed
another
for
so
soon
as
he
was
informed
that
the
persian
had
crossed
over
the
hellespont
he
sent
cadmos
the
son
of
skythes
a
man
of
cos
with
three
galleys
to
delphi
bearing
large
sums
of
money
and
friendly
proposals
to
wait
there
and
see
how
the
battle
would
fall
out
and
if
the
barbarian
should
be
victorious
he
was
to
give
him
the
money
and
also
to
offer
him
earth
and
water
from
those
over
whom
gelon
had
rule
but
if
the
hellenes
should
be
victorious
he
was
bidden
to
bring
it
back
now
this
cadmos
before
these
events
having
received
from
his
father
in
a
prosperous
state
the
government
of
the
people
of
cos
had
voluntarily
and
with
no
danger
threatening
but
moved
merely
by
uprightness
of
nature
placed
the
government
in
the
hands
of
the
people
of
cos
and
had
departed
to
sicily
where
he
took
from
the
samians
and
newly
colonised
the
city
of
zancle
which
had
changed
its
name
to
messene
this
same
cadmos
having
come
thither
in
such
manner
as
i
have
said
gelon
was
now
sending
having
selected
him
on
account
of
the
integrity
which
in
other
matters
he
had
himself
found
to
be
in
him
and
this
man
in
addition
to
the
other
upright
acts
which
had
been
done
by
him
left
also
this
to
be
remembered
which
was
not
the
least
of
them
for
having
got
into
his
hands
that
great
sum
of
money
which
gelon
entrusted
to
his
charge
though
he
might
have
taken
possession
of
it
himself
he
did
not
choose
to
do
so
but
when
the
hellenes
had
got
the
better
in
the
and
xerxes
had
marched
away
and
departed
he
also
returned
to
sicily
bringing
back
with
him
the
whole
sum
of
money
the
story
which
here
follows
is
also
reported
by
those
who
dwell
in
sicily
namely
that
even
though
he
was
to
be
under
the
command
of
the
lacedemonians
gelon
would
have
come
to
the
assistance
of
the
hellenes
but
that
terillos
the
son
of
crinippos
and
despot
of
himera
having
been
driven
out
of
himera
by
theron
the
son
of
ainesidemos
the
ruler
of
the
agrigentines
was
just
at
this
very
time
bringing
in
an
army
of
phenicians
libyans
iberians
ligurians
elisycans
sardinians
and
corsicans
to
the
number
of
thirty
myriads
with
amilcas
the
son
of
annon
king
of
the
carthaginians
as
their
commander
whom
terillos
had
persuaded
partly
by
reason
of
his
own
and
especially
by
the
zealous
assistance
of
anaxilaos
the
son
of
cretines
who
was
despot
of
rhegion
and
who
to
help
his
endeavoured
to
bring
in
amilcas
to
sicily
and
had
given
him
his
sons
as
hostages
for
anaxilaos
was
married
to
the
daughter
of
terillos
whose
name
was
kydippe
thus
it
was
they
say
that
gelon
was
not
able
to
come
to
the
assistance
of
the
hellenes
and
sent
therefore
the
money
to
delphi
in
addition
to
this
they
report
also
that
as
it
happened
gelon
and
theron
were
victorious
over
amilcas
the
carthaginian
on
the
very
same
day
when
the
hellenes
were
victorious
at
salamis
over
the
persian
and
this
amilcas
who
was
a
carthaginian
on
the
father
side
but
on
the
mother
syracusan
and
who
had
become
king
of
the
carthaginians
by
merit
when
the
engagement
took
place
and
he
was
being
worsted
in
the
battle
disappeared
as
i
am
informed
for
neither
alive
nor
dead
did
he
appear
again
anywhere
upon
the
earth
though
gelon
used
all
diligence
in
the
search
for
him
moreover
there
is
also
this
story
reported
by
the
carthaginians
themselves
who
therein
relate
that
which
is
probable
in
itself
namely
that
while
the
barbarians
fought
with
the
hellenes
in
sicily
from
the
early
morning
till
late
in
the
afternoon
for
to
such
a
length
the
combat
is
said
to
have
been
protracted
during
this
time
amilcas
was
remaining
in
the
camp
and
was
making
sacrifices
to
get
good
omens
of
success
offering
whole
bodies
of
victims
upon
a
great
pyre
and
when
he
saw
that
there
was
a
rout
of
his
own
army
he
being
then
as
it
chanced
in
the
act
of
pouring
a
libation
over
the
victims
threw
himself
into
the
fire
and
thus
he
was
burnt
up
and
disappeared
amilcas
then
having
disappeared
whether
it
was
in
such
a
manner
as
this
as
it
is
reported
by
the
phenicians
or
in
some
other
way
the
carthaginians
both
offer
sacrifices
to
him
now
and
also
they
made
memorials
of
him
then
in
all
the
cities
of
their
colonies
and
the
greatest
in
carthage
itself
so
far
of
the
affairs
of
sicily
and
as
for
the
corcyreans
they
made
answer
to
the
envoys
as
follows
afterwards
acting
as
i
shall
tell
for
the
same
men
who
had
gone
to
sicily
endeavoured
also
to
obtain
the
help
of
these
saying
the
same
things
which
they
said
to
gelon
and
the
corcyreans
at
the
time
engaged
to
send
a
force
and
to
help
in
the
defence
declaring
that
they
must
not
permit
hellas
to
be
ruined
without
an
effort
on
their
part
for
if
it
should
suffer
disaster
they
would
be
reduced
to
subjection
from
the
very
first
day
but
they
must
give
assistance
so
far
as
lay
in
their
power
thus
speciously
they
made
reply
but
when
the
time
came
to
send
help
they
manned
sixty
ships
having
other
intentions
in
their
minds
and
after
making
much
difficulty
they
put
out
to
sea
and
reached
peloponnese
and
then
near
pylos
and
tainaron
in
the
land
of
the
lacedemonians
they
kept
their
ships
at
anchor
waiting
as
gelon
did
to
see
how
the
war
would
turn
out
for
they
did
not
expect
that
the
hellenes
would
overcome
but
thought
that
the
persian
would
gain
the
victory
over
them
with
ease
and
be
ruler
of
all
hellas
accordingly
they
were
acting
of
set
purpose
in
order
that
they
might
be
able
to
say
to
the
persian
some
such
words
as
these
o
king
when
the
hellenes
endeavoured
to
obtain
our
help
for
this
war
we
who
have
a
power
which
is
not
the
smallest
of
all
and
could
have
supplied
a
contingent
of
ships
in
number
not
the
smallest
but
after
the
athenians
the
largest
did
not
choose
to
oppose
thee
or
to
do
anything
which
was
not
to
thy
mind
by
speaking
thus
they
hoped
that
they
would
obtain
some
advantage
over
the
rest
and
so
it
would
have
happened
as
i
am
of
opinion
while
they
had
for
the
hellenes
an
excuse
ready
made
that
namely
of
which
they
actually
made
use
for
when
the
hellenes
reproached
them
because
they
did
not
come
to
help
they
said
that
they
had
manned
sixty
triremes
but
had
not
been
able
to
get
past
malea
owing
to
the
etesian
winds
therefore
it
was
that
they
had
not
come
to
salamis
nor
was
it
by
any
want
of
courage
on
their
part
that
they
had
been
left
of
the
these
then
evaded
the
request
of
the
hellenes
thus
but
the
cretans
when
those
of
the
hellenes
who
had
been
appointed
to
deal
with
these
endeavoured
to
obtain
their
help
did
thus
that
is
to
say
they
joined
together
and
sent
men
to
inquire
of
the
god
at
delphi
whether
it
would
be
better
for
them
if
they
gave
assistance
to
hellas
and
the
pythian
prophetess
answered
ye
fools
do
ye
think
those
woes
too
few
which
minos
sent
upon
you
in
his
wrath
because
of
the
assistance
that
ye
gave
to
menelaos
seeing
that
whereas
they
did
not
join
with
you
in
taking
vengeance
for
his
death
in
camicos
ye
nevertheless
joined
with
them
in
taking
vengeance
for
the
woman
who
by
a
barbarian
was
carried
off
from
sparta
when
the
cretans
heard
this
answer
reported
they
abstained
from
the
giving
of
assistance
for
the
story
goes
that
minos
having
come
to
sicania
which
is
now
called
sicily
in
search
of
daidalos
died
there
by
a
violent
death
and
after
a
time
the
cretans
urged
thereto
by
a
god
all
except
the
men
of
polichne
and
praisos
came
with
a
great
armament
to
sicania
and
besieged
for
seven
years
the
city
of
camicos
which
in
my
time
was
occupied
by
the
agrigentines
and
at
last
not
being
able
either
to
capture
it
or
to
remain
before
it
because
they
were
hard
pressed
by
famine
they
departed
and
went
away
and
when
as
they
sailed
they
came
to
be
off
the
coast
of
iapygia
a
great
storm
seized
them
and
cast
them
away
upon
the
coast
and
their
vessels
being
dashed
to
pieces
they
since
they
saw
no
longer
any
way
of
coming
to
crete
founded
there
the
city
of
hyria
and
there
they
stayed
and
were
changed
so
that
they
became
instead
of
cretans
messapians
of
iapygia
and
instead
of
islanders
dwellers
on
the
mainland
then
from
the
city
of
hyria
they
founded
those
other
settlements
which
the
tarentines
long
afterwards
endeavoured
to
destroy
and
suffer
great
disaster
in
that
enterprise
so
that
this
in
fact
proved
to
be
the
greatest
slaughter
of
hellenes
that
is
known
to
us
and
not
only
of
the
tarentines
themselves
but
of
those
citizens
of
rhegion
who
were
compelled
by
mikythos
the
son
of
choiros
to
go
to
the
assistance
of
the
tarentines
and
of
whom
there
were
slain
in
this
manner
three
thousand
men
of
the
tarentines
themselves
however
who
were
slain
there
there
was
no
numbering
made
this
mikythos
who
was
a
servant
of
anaxilaos
had
been
left
by
him
in
charge
of
rhegion
and
he
it
was
who
after
being
driven
out
of
rhegion
took
up
his
abode
at
tegea
of
the
arcadians
and
dedicated
those
many
statues
at
olympia
this
of
the
men
of
rhegion
and
of
the
tarentines
has
been
an
episode
in
my
narrative
in
crete
however
as
the
men
of
praisos
report
after
it
had
been
thus
stripped
of
inhabitants
settlements
were
made
by
various
nations
but
especially
by
hellenes
and
in
the
next
generation
but
one
after
the
death
of
minos
came
the
trojan
war
in
which
the
cretans
proved
not
the
most
contemptible
of
those
who
came
to
assist
menelaos
then
after
this
when
they
had
returned
home
from
troy
famine
and
pestilence
came
upon
both
the
men
and
their
cattle
until
at
last
crete
was
stripped
of
its
inhabitants
for
the
second
time
and
a
third
population
of
cretans
now
occupy
it
together
with
those
which
were
left
of
the
former
inhabitants
the
pythian
prophetess
i
say
by
calling
these
things
to
their
minds
stopped
them
from
giving
assistance
to
the
hellenes
though
they
desired
to
do
so
as
for
the
thessalians
they
at
first
had
taken
the
side
of
the
persians
against
their
will
and
they
gave
proof
that
they
were
not
pleased
by
that
which
the
aleuadai
were
designing
for
so
soon
as
they
heard
that
the
persian
was
about
to
cross
over
into
europe
they
sent
envoys
to
the
isthmus
now
at
the
isthmus
were
assembled
representatives
of
hellas
chosen
by
the
cities
which
had
the
better
mind
about
hellas
having
come
then
to
these
the
envoys
of
the
thessalians
said
hellenes
ye
must
guard
the
pass
by
olympos
in
order
that
both
thessaly
and
the
whole
of
hellas
may
be
sheltered
from
the
war
we
are
prepared
to
join
with
you
in
guarding
it
but
ye
must
send
a
large
force
as
well
as
we
for
if
ye
shall
not
send
be
assured
that
we
shall
make
agreement
with
the
persian
since
it
is
not
right
that
we
standing
as
outposts
so
far
in
advance
of
the
rest
of
hellas
should
perish
alone
in
your
defence
and
not
being
willing
to
come
to
our
help
ye
can
not
apply
to
us
any
force
to
compel
inability
but
we
shall
endeavour
to
devise
some
means
of
safety
for
ourselves
thus
spoke
the
thessalians
and
the
hellenes
upon
this
resolved
to
send
to
thessaly
by
sea
an
army
of
men
on
foot
to
guard
the
pass
and
when
the
army
was
assembled
it
set
sail
through
euripos
and
having
come
to
alos
in
the
achaian
land
it
disembarked
there
and
marched
into
thessaly
leaving
the
ships
behind
at
alos
and
arrived
at
tempe
the
pass
which
leads
from
lower
macedonia
into
thessaly
by
the
river
peneios
going
between
the
mountains
of
olympos
and
ossa
there
the
hellenes
encamped
being
assembled
to
the
number
of
about
ten
thousand
hoplites
and
to
them
was
added
the
cavalry
of
the
thessalians
and
the
commander
of
the
lacedemonians
was
euainetos
the
son
of
carenos
who
had
been
chosen
from
the
polemarchs
not
being
of
the
royal
house
and
of
the
athenians
themistocles
the
son
of
neocles
they
remained
however
but
few
days
here
for
envoys
came
from
alexander
the
son
of
amyntas
the
macedonian
who
advised
them
to
depart
thence
and
not
to
remain
in
the
pass
and
be
trodden
under
foot
by
the
invading
host
signifying
to
them
at
the
same
time
both
the
great
numbers
of
the
army
and
the
ships
which
they
had
when
these
gave
them
this
counsel
they
followed
the
advice
for
they
thought
that
the
counsel
was
good
and
the
macedonian
was
evidently
towards
them
also
as
i
think
it
was
fear
that
persuaded
them
to
it
when
they
were
informed
that
there
was
another
pass
besides
this
to
the
thessalian
land
by
upper
macedonia
through
the
perraibians
and
by
the
city
of
gonnos
the
way
by
which
the
army
of
xerxes
did
in
fact
make
its
entrance
so
the
hellenes
went
down
to
their
ships
again
and
made
their
way
back
to
the
isthmus
such
was
the
expedition
to
thessaly
which
took
place
when
the
king
was
about
to
cross
over
from
asia
to
europe
and
was
already
at
abydos
so
the
thessalians
being
stripped
of
allies
upon
this
took
the
side
of
the
medes
with
a
good
will
and
no
longer
so
that
in
the
course
of
events
they
proved
very
serviceable
to
the
king
when
the
hellenes
had
returned
to
the
isthmus
they
deliberated
having
regard
to
that
which
had
been
said
by
alexander
where
and
in
what
regions
they
should
set
the
war
on
foot
and
the
opinion
which
prevailed
was
to
guard
the
pass
at
thermopylai
for
it
was
seen
to
be
narrower
than
that
leading
into
thessaly
and
at
the
same
time
it
was
single
and
nearer
also
to
their
own
land
and
as
for
the
path
by
means
of
which
were
taken
those
of
the
hellenes
who
were
taken
by
the
enemy
at
thermopylai
they
did
not
even
know
of
its
existence
until
they
were
informed
by
the
people
of
trachis
after
they
had
come
to
thermopylai
this
pass
then
they
resolved
to
guard
and
not
permit
the
barbarian
to
go
by
into
hellas
and
they
resolved
that
the
fleet
should
sail
to
artemision
in
the
territory
of
histiaia
for
these
points
are
near
to
one
another
so
that
each
division
of
their
forces
could
have
information
of
what
was
happening
to
the
other
and
the
places
are
so
situated
as
i
shall
describe
as
to
artemision
first
coming
out
of
the
thracian
sea
the
space
is
contracted
from
great
width
to
that
narrow
channel
which
lies
between
the
island
of
skiathos
and
the
mainland
of
magnesia
and
after
the
strait
there
follows
at
once
in
euboea
the
called
artemision
upon
which
there
is
a
temple
of
artemis
then
secondly
the
passage
into
hellas
by
trechis
is
where
it
is
narrowest
but
fifty
feet
wide
it
is
not
here
however
that
the
narrowest
part
of
this
whole
region
lies
but
in
front
of
thermopylai
and
also
behind
it
consisting
of
a
single
only
both
by
alpenoi
which
lies
behind
thermopylai
and
again
by
the
river
phoinix
near
the
town
of
anthela
there
is
no
space
but
a
single
only
and
on
the
west
of
thermopylai
there
is
a
mountain
which
is
impassable
and
precipitous
rising
up
to
a
great
height
and
extending
towards
the
range
of
oite
while
on
the
east
of
the
road
the
sea
with
swampy
pools
succeeds
at
once
in
this
passage
there
are
hot
springs
which
the
natives
of
the
place
call
the
pots
and
an
altar
of
heracles
is
set
up
near
them
moreover
a
wall
had
once
been
built
at
this
pass
and
in
old
times
there
was
a
gate
set
in
it
which
wall
was
built
by
the
phokians
who
were
struck
with
fear
because
the
thessalians
had
come
from
the
land
of
the
thesprotians
to
settle
in
the
aiolian
land
the
same
which
they
now
possess
since
then
the
thessalians
as
they
supposed
were
attempting
to
subdue
them
the
phokians
guarded
themselves
against
this
beforehand
and
at
that
time
they
let
the
water
of
the
hot
springs
run
over
the
passage
that
the
place
might
be
converted
into
a
ravine
and
devised
every
means
that
the
thessalians
might
not
make
invasion
of
their
land
now
the
ancient
wall
had
been
built
long
before
and
the
greater
part
of
it
was
by
that
time
in
ruins
from
lapse
of
time
the
hellenes
however
resolved
to
set
it
up
again
and
at
this
spot
to
repel
the
barbarian
from
hellas
and
very
near
the
road
there
is
a
village
called
alpenoi
from
which
the
hellenes
counted
on
getting
supplies
these
places
then
the
hellenes
perceived
to
be
such
as
their
purpose
required
for
they
considered
everything
beforehand
and
calculated
that
the
barbarians
would
not
be
able
to
take
advantage
either
of
superior
numbers
or
of
cavalry
and
therefore
they
resolved
here
to
receive
the
invader
of
hellas
and
when
they
were
informed
that
the
persian
was
in
pieria
they
broke
up
from
the
isthmus
and
set
forth
for
the
campaign
some
going
to
thermopylai
by
land
and
others
making
for
artemision
by
sea
the
hellenes
i
say
were
coming
to
the
rescue
with
speed
having
been
appointed
to
their
several
places
and
meanwhile
the
men
of
delphi
consulted
the
oracle
of
the
god
on
behalf
of
themselves
and
on
behalf
of
hellas
being
struck
with
dread
and
a
reply
was
given
them
that
they
should
pray
to
the
winds
for
these
would
be
powerful
helpers
of
hellas
in
fight
so
the
delphians
having
accepted
the
oracle
first
reported
the
answer
which
had
been
given
them
to
those
of
the
hellenes
who
desired
to
be
free
and
having
reported
this
to
them
at
a
time
when
they
were
in
great
dread
of
the
barbarian
they
laid
up
for
themselves
an
immortal
store
of
gratitude
then
after
this
the
men
of
delphi
established
an
altar
for
the
winds
in
thuia
where
is
the
sacred
enclosure
of
thuia
the
daughter
of
kephisos
after
whom
moreover
this
place
has
its
name
and
also
they
approached
them
with
sacrifices
the
delphians
then
according
to
the
oracle
even
to
this
day
make
propitiary
offerings
to
the
winds
and
meanwhile
the
fleet
of
xerxes
setting
forth
from
the
city
of
therma
had
passed
over
with
ten
of
its
ships
which
were
those
that
sailed
best
straight
towards
skiathos
where
three
hellenic
ships
a
troizenian
an
eginetan
and
an
athenian
were
keeping
watch
in
advance
when
the
crews
of
these
caught
sight
of
the
ships
of
the
barbarians
they
set
off
to
make
their
escape
and
the
ship
of
troizen
of
which
prexinos
was
in
command
was
pursued
and
captured
at
once
by
the
barbarians
who
upon
that
took
the
man
who
was
most
distinguished
by
beauty
among
the
on
board
of
her
and
cut
his
throat
at
the
prow
of
the
ship
making
a
good
omen
for
themselves
of
the
first
of
the
hellenes
whom
they
had
captured
who
was
for
beauty
the
name
of
this
man
who
was
sacrificed
was
leon
and
perhaps
he
had
also
his
name
to
thank
in
some
degree
for
what
befell
him
the
ship
of
egina
however
of
which
asonides
was
master
even
gave
them
some
trouble
to
capture
it
seeing
that
pytheas
the
son
of
ischenoös
served
as
a
on
board
of
her
who
proved
himself
a
most
valiant
man
on
this
day
for
when
the
ship
was
being
taken
he
held
out
fighting
until
he
was
hacked
all
to
pieces
and
as
when
he
had
fallen
he
did
not
die
but
had
still
breath
in
him
the
persians
who
served
as
on
board
the
ships
because
of
his
valour
used
all
diligence
to
save
his
life
both
applying
unguents
of
myrrh
to
heal
his
wounds
and
also
wrapping
him
up
in
bands
of
the
finest
linen
and
when
they
came
back
to
their
own
main
body
they
showed
him
to
all
the
army
making
a
marvel
of
him
and
giving
him
good
treatment
but
the
rest
whom
they
had
taken
in
this
ship
they
treated
as
slaves
two
of
the
three
ships
i
say
were
captured
thus
but
the
third
of
which
phormos
an
athenian
was
master
ran
ashore
in
its
flight
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
peneios
and
the
barbarians
got
possession
of
the
vessel
but
not
of
the
crew
for
so
soon
as
the
athenians
had
run
the
ship
ashore
they
leapt
out
of
her
and
passing
through
thessaly
made
their
way
to
athens
of
these
things
the
hellenes
who
were
stationed
at
artemision
were
informed
by
from
skiathos
and
being
informed
of
them
and
being
struck
with
fear
they
removed
their
place
of
anchorage
from
atermision
to
chalkis
intending
to
guard
the
euripos
but
leaving
at
the
same
time
watchers
by
day
on
the
heights
of
euboea
of
the
ten
ships
of
the
barbarians
three
sailed
up
to
the
reef
called
myrmex
which
lies
between
skiathos
and
magnesia
and
when
the
barbarians
had
there
erected
a
stone
pillar
which
for
that
purpose
they
brought
to
the
reef
they
set
forth
with
their
main
body
from
therma
the
difficulties
of
the
passage
having
now
been
cleared
away
and
sailed
thither
with
all
their
ships
having
let
eleven
days
go
by
since
the
king
set
forth
on
his
march
from
therma
now
of
this
reef
lying
exactly
in
the
middle
of
the
fairway
they
were
informed
by
pammon
of
skyros
sailing
then
throughout
the
day
the
barbarians
accomplished
the
voyage
to
sepias
in
magnesia
and
to
the
which
is
between
the
city
of
casthanaia
and
the
headland
of
sepias
so
far
as
this
place
and
so
far
as
thermopylai
the
army
was
exempt
from
calamity
and
the
number
was
then
still
as
i
find
by
computation
this
of
the
ships
which
came
from
asia
which
were
one
thousand
two
hundred
and
seven
the
original
number
of
the
crews
supplied
by
the
several
nations
i
find
to
have
been
myriads
and
also
in
addition
to
them
one
thousand
four
hundred
if
one
reckons
at
the
rate
of
two
hundred
men
to
each
ship
and
on
board
of
each
of
these
ships
there
served
as
besides
the
belonging
to
its
own
nation
in
each
case
thirty
men
who
were
persians
medes
or
sacans
and
this
amounts
to
three
myriads
six
thousand
two
hundred
and
ten
in
addition
to
the
others
i
will
add
also
to
this
and
to
the
former
number
the
crews
of
the
galleys
assuming
that
there
were
eighty
men
more
or
less
in
each
one
of
these
vessels
there
were
gathered
together
as
was
before
said
three
thousand
it
would
follow
therefore
that
there
were
in
them
myriads
of
men
this
was
the
naval
force
which
came
from
asia
amounting
in
all
to
myriads
and
also
seven
thousand
six
hundred
and
ten
in
addition
then
of
the
footmen
there
had
been
found
to
be
a
hundred
and
seventy
myriads
and
of
the
horsemen
eight
myriads
and
i
will
add
also
to
these
the
arabian
and
the
libyan
drivers
of
chariots
assuming
them
to
amount
to
twenty
thousand
men
the
result
is
then
that
the
number
of
the
crews
combined
with
that
of
the
amounts
to
two
hundred
and
myriads
and
also
in
addition
seven
thousand
six
hundred
and
ten
this
is
the
statement
of
the
army
which
was
brought
up
out
of
asia
itself
without
counting
the
attendants
which
accompanied
it
or
the
and
the
men
who
sailed
in
these
there
is
still
to
be
reckoned
in
addition
to
all
this
which
has
been
summed
up
the
force
which
was
being
led
from
europe
and
of
this
we
must
give
a
probable
estimate
the
hellenes
of
thrace
and
of
the
islands
which
lie
off
the
coast
of
thrace
supplied
a
hundred
and
twenty
ships
from
which
ships
there
results
a
sum
of
thousand
men
and
as
regards
the
which
was
supplied
by
the
thracians
paionians
eordians
bottiaians
the
race
which
inhabits
chalkidike
the
brygians
pierians
macedonians
perraibians
enianians
dolopians
magnesians
achaians
and
all
those
who
dwell
in
the
of
thrace
of
these
various
nations
i
estimate
that
there
were
thirty
myriads
these
myriads
then
added
to
those
from
asia
make
a
total
sum
of
two
hundred
and
myriads
of
fighting
men
and
in
addition
to
these
sixteen
hundred
and
ten
such
being
the
number
of
this
body
of
the
attendants
who
went
with
these
and
the
men
who
were
in
the
small
vessels
which
carried
corn
and
again
in
the
other
vessels
which
sailed
with
the
army
these
i
suppose
were
not
less
in
number
but
more
than
the
fighting
men
i
assume
them
to
be
equal
in
number
with
these
and
neither
at
all
more
nor
less
and
so
being
supposed
equal
in
number
with
the
fighting
body
they
make
up
the
same
number
of
myriads
as
they
thus
five
hundred
and
myriads
three
thousand
two
hundred
and
twenty
was
the
number
of
men
whom
xerxes
son
of
dareios
led
as
far
as
sepias
and
thermopylai
this
is
the
number
of
the
whole
army
of
xerxes
but
of
the
women
who
made
bread
for
it
and
of
the
concubines
and
eunuchs
no
man
can
state
any
exact
number
nor
again
of
the
and
other
beasts
of
burden
or
of
the
indian
hounds
which
accompanied
it
could
any
one
state
the
number
by
reason
of
their
multitude
so
that
it
does
not
occur
to
me
to
wonder
that
the
streams
of
some
rivers
should
have
failed
them
but
i
wonder
rather
how
the
provisions
were
sufficient
to
feed
so
many
myriads
for
i
find
on
computation
that
if
each
man
received
a
quart
of
wheat
every
day
and
nothing
more
there
would
be
expended
every
day
eleven
myriads
of
medimnoi
and
three
hundred
and
forty
medimnoi
besides
and
here
i
am
not
reckoning
anything
for
the
women
eunuchs
or
dogs
of
all
these
men
amounting
to
so
many
myriads
not
one
was
for
beauty
and
stature
more
worthy
than
xerxes
himself
to
possess
this
power
the
fleet
i
say
set
forth
and
sailed
and
when
it
had
put
in
to
land
in
the
region
of
magnesia
at
the
beach
which
is
between
the
city
of
casthanaia
and
the
headland
of
sepias
the
first
of
the
ships
which
came
lay
moored
by
the
land
and
the
others
rode
at
anchor
behind
them
for
as
the
beach
was
not
large
in
extent
they
lay
at
anchor
with
prows
projecting
towards
the
sea
in
an
order
which
was
eight
ships
deep
for
that
night
they
lay
thus
but
at
early
dawn
after
clear
sky
and
windless
calm
the
sea
began
to
be
violently
agitated
and
a
great
storm
fell
upon
them
with
a
strong
east
wind
that
wind
which
they
who
dwell
about
those
parts
call
hellespontias
now
as
many
of
them
as
perceived
that
the
wind
was
rising
and
who
were
so
moored
that
it
was
possible
for
them
to
do
so
drew
up
their
ships
on
land
before
the
storm
came
and
both
they
and
their
ships
escaped
but
as
for
those
of
the
ships
which
it
caught
out
at
sea
some
it
cast
away
at
the
place
called
ipnoi
in
pelion
and
others
on
the
beach
while
some
were
wrecked
on
the
headland
of
sepias
itself
others
at
the
city
of
meliboia
and
others
were
thrown
up
on
shore
at
casthanaia
and
the
violence
of
the
storm
could
not
be
resisted
there
is
a
story
reported
that
the
athenians
had
called
upon
boreas
to
aid
them
by
suggestion
of
an
oracle
because
there
had
come
to
them
another
utterance
of
the
god
bidding
them
call
upon
their
brother
by
marriage
to
be
their
helper
now
according
to
the
story
of
the
hellenes
boreas
has
a
wife
who
is
of
attica
oreithuia
the
daughter
of
erechththeus
by
reason
of
this
affinity
i
say
the
athenians
according
to
the
tale
which
has
gone
abroad
conjectured
that
their
brother
by
marriage
was
boreas
and
when
they
perceived
the
wind
rising
as
they
lay
with
their
ships
at
chalkis
in
euboea
or
even
before
that
they
offered
sacrifices
and
called
upon
boreas
and
oreithuia
to
assist
them
and
to
destroy
the
ships
of
the
barbarians
as
they
had
done
before
round
about
mount
athos
whether
it
was
for
this
reason
that
the
wind
boreas
fell
upon
the
barbarians
while
they
lay
at
anchor
i
am
not
able
to
say
but
however
that
may
be
the
athenians
report
that
boreas
had
come
to
their
help
in
former
times
and
that
at
this
time
he
accomplished
those
things
for
them
of
which
i
speak
and
when
they
had
returned
home
they
set
up
a
temple
dedicated
to
boreas
by
the
river
ilissos
in
this
disaster
the
number
of
the
ships
which
were
lost
was
not
less
than
four
hundred
according
to
the
report
of
those
who
state
the
number
which
is
lowest
with
men
innumerable
and
an
immense
quantity
of
valuable
things
insomuch
that
to
ameinocles
the
son
of
cretines
a
magnesian
who
held
lands
about
sepias
this
shipwreck
proved
very
gainful
for
he
picked
up
many
cups
of
gold
which
were
thrown
up
afterwards
on
the
shore
and
many
also
of
silver
and
found
which
had
belonged
to
the
persians
and
made
acquisition
of
other
things
of
gold
more
than
can
be
described
this
man
however
though
he
became
very
wealthy
by
the
things
which
he
found
yet
in
other
respects
was
not
fortunate
for
he
too
suffered
misfortune
being
troubled
by
the
slaying
of
a
child
of
the
and
other
vessels
which
perished
there
was
no
numbering
made
and
so
great
was
the
loss
that
the
commanders
of
the
fleet
being
struck
with
fear
lest
the
thessalians
should
attack
them
now
that
they
had
been
brought
into
an
evil
plight
threw
round
their
camp
a
lofty
palisade
built
of
the
fragments
of
wreck
for
the
storm
continued
during
three
days
but
at
last
the
magians
making
sacrifice
of
victims
and
singing
incantations
to
appease
the
wind
by
enchantments
and
in
addition
to
this
offering
to
thetis
and
the
nereïds
caused
it
to
cease
on
the
fourth
day
or
else
for
some
other
reason
it
abated
of
its
own
will
now
they
offered
sacrifice
to
thetis
being
informed
by
the
ionians
of
the
story
that
she
was
carried
off
from
the
place
by
peleus
and
that
the
whole
headland
of
sepias
belonged
to
her
and
to
the
other
nereïds
the
storm
then
had
ceased
on
the
fourth
day
and
meanwhile
the
had
run
down
from
the
heights
of
euboea
on
the
day
after
the
first
storm
began
and
were
keeping
the
hellenes
informed
of
all
that
had
happened
as
regards
the
shipwreck
they
then
being
informed
of
it
prayed
first
to
poseidon
the
saviour
and
poured
libations
and
then
they
hastened
to
go
back
to
artemision
expecting
that
there
would
be
but
a
very
few
ships
of
the
enemy
left
to
come
against
them
they
i
say
came
for
the
second
time
and
lay
with
their
ships
about
artemision
and
from
that
time
even
to
this
they
preserve
the
use
of
the
surname
saviour
for
poseidon
meanwhile
the
barbarians
when
the
wind
had
ceased
and
the
swell
of
the
sea
had
calmed
down
drew
their
ships
into
the
sea
and
sailed
on
along
the
shore
of
the
mainland
and
having
rounded
the
extremity
of
magnesia
they
sailed
straight
into
the
gulf
which
leads
towards
pagasai
in
this
gulf
of
magnesia
there
is
a
place
where
it
is
said
that
heracles
was
left
behind
by
jason
and
his
comrades
having
been
sent
from
the
argo
to
fetch
water
at
the
time
when
they
were
sailing
for
the
fleece
to
aia
in
the
land
of
colchis
for
from
that
place
they
designed
when
they
had
taken
in
water
to
loose
their
ship
into
the
open
sea
and
from
this
the
place
has
come
to
have
the
name
aphetai
here
then
the
fleet
of
xerxes
took
up
its
moorings
now
it
chanced
that
fifteen
of
these
ships
put
out
to
sea
a
good
deal
later
than
the
rest
and
they
happened
to
catch
sight
of
the
ships
of
the
hellenes
at
artemision
these
ships
the
barbarians
supposed
to
be
their
own
and
they
sailed
thither
accordingly
and
fell
among
the
enemy
of
these
the
commander
was
sandokes
the
son
of
thamasios
the
governor
of
kyme
in
aiolia
whom
before
this
time
king
dareios
had
taken
and
crucified
he
being
one
of
the
royal
judges
for
this
reason
namely
that
sandokes
had
pronounced
judgment
unjustly
for
money
so
then
after
he
was
hung
up
dareios
reckoned
and
found
that
more
good
services
had
been
done
by
him
to
the
royal
house
than
were
equal
to
his
offences
and
having
found
this
and
perceived
that
he
had
himself
acted
with
more
haste
than
wisdom
he
let
him
go
thus
he
escaped
from
king
dareios
and
did
not
perish
but
survived
now
however
when
he
sailed
in
toward
the
hellenes
he
was
destined
not
to
escape
the
second
time
for
when
the
hellenes
saw
them
sailing
up
perceiving
the
mistake
which
was
being
made
they
put
out
against
them
and
captured
them
without
difficulty
sailing
in
one
of
these
ships
aridolis
was
captured
the
despot
of
alabanda
in
caria
and
in
another
the
paphian
commander
penthylos
son
of
demonoös
who
brought
twelve
ships
from
paphos
but
had
lost
eleven
of
them
in
the
storm
which
had
come
on
by
sepias
and
now
was
captured
sailing
in
towards
artemision
with
the
one
which
had
escaped
these
men
the
hellenes
sent
away
in
bonds
to
the
isthmus
of
the
corinthians
after
having
inquired
of
them
that
which
they
desired
to
learn
of
the
army
of
xerxes
the
fleet
of
the
barbarians
then
except
the
fifteen
ships
of
which
i
said
that
sandokes
was
in
command
had
arrived
at
aphetai
and
xerxes
meanwhile
with
the
having
marched
through
thessalia
and
achaia
had
already
entered
the
land
of
the
malians
two
days
before
after
having
held
in
thessaly
a
contest
for
his
own
horses
making
trial
also
of
the
thessalian
cavalry
because
he
was
informed
that
it
was
the
best
of
all
among
the
hellenes
and
in
this
trial
the
horses
of
hellas
were
far
surpassed
by
the
others
now
of
the
rivers
in
thessalia
the
onochonos
alone
failed
to
suffice
by
its
stream
for
the
drinking
of
the
army
but
of
the
rivers
which
flow
in
achaia
even
that
which
is
the
largest
of
them
namely
epidanos
even
this
i
say
held
out
but
barely
when
xerxes
had
reached
alos
of
achaia
the
guides
who
gave
him
information
of
the
way
wishing
to
inform
him
fully
of
everything
reported
to
him
a
legend
of
the
place
the
things
namely
which
have
to
do
with
the
temple
of
zeus
laphystios
how
athamas
the
son
of
aiolos
contrived
death
for
phrixos
having
taken
counsel
with
ino
and
after
this
how
by
command
of
an
oracle
the
achaians
propose
to
his
descendants
the
following
tasks
to
be
performed
whosoever
is
the
eldest
of
this
race
on
him
they
lay
an
injunction
that
he
is
forbidden
to
enter
the
city
hall
and
they
themselves
keep
watch
now
the
city
hall
is
called
by
the
achaians
the
hall
of
the
people
and
if
he
enter
it
it
may
not
be
that
he
shall
come
forth
until
he
is
about
to
be
sacrificed
they
related
moreover
in
addition
to
this
that
many
of
these
who
were
about
to
be
sacrificed
had
before
now
run
away
and
departed
to
another
land
because
they
were
afraid
and
if
afterwards
in
course
of
time
they
returned
to
their
own
land
and
were
caught
they
were
placed
in
the
city
hall
and
they
told
how
the
man
is
sacrificed
all
thickly
covered
with
wreaths
and
with
what
form
of
procession
he
is
brought
forth
to
the
sacrifice
this
is
done
to
the
descendants
of
kytissoros
the
son
of
phrixos
because
when
the
achaians
were
making
of
athamas
the
son
of
aiolos
a
victim
to
purge
the
sins
of
the
land
according
to
the
command
of
an
oracle
and
were
just
about
to
sacrifice
him
this
kytissoros
coming
from
aia
of
the
colchians
rescued
him
and
having
done
so
he
brought
the
wrath
of
the
gods
upon
his
own
descendants
having
heard
these
things
xerxes
when
he
came
to
the
sacred
grove
both
abstained
from
entering
it
himself
and
gave
the
command
to
his
whole
army
to
so
likewise
and
he
paid
reverence
both
to
the
house
and
to
the
sacred
enclosure
of
the
descendants
of
athamas
these
then
are
the
things
which
happened
in
thessalia
and
in
achaia
and
from
these
regions
he
proceeded
to
the
malian
land
going
along
by
a
gulf
of
the
sea
in
which
there
is
an
ebb
and
flow
of
the
tide
every
day
round
about
this
gulf
there
is
a
level
space
which
in
parts
is
broad
but
in
other
parts
very
narrow
and
mountains
lofty
and
inaccessible
surrounding
this
place
enclose
the
whole
land
of
malis
and
are
called
the
rocks
of
trachis
the
first
city
upon
this
gulf
as
one
goes
from
achaia
is
antikyra
by
which
the
river
spercheios
flowing
from
the
land
of
the
enianians
runs
out
into
the
sea
at
a
distance
of
twenty
furlongs
or
thereabouts
from
this
river
there
is
another
of
which
the
name
is
dyras
this
is
said
to
have
appeared
that
it
might
bring
assistance
to
heracles
when
he
was
burning
then
again
at
a
distance
of
twenty
furlongs
from
this
there
is
another
river
called
melas
from
this
river
melas
the
city
of
trachis
is
distant
five
furlongs
and
here
in
the
parts
where
trachis
is
situated
is
even
the
widest
portion
of
all
this
district
as
regards
the
space
from
the
mountains
to
the
sea
for
the
plain
has
an
extent
of
thousand
plethra
in
the
which
encloses
the
land
of
trachis
there
is
a
cleft
to
the
south
of
trachis
itself
and
through
this
cleft
the
river
asopos
flows
and
runs
along
by
the
foot
of
the
mountain
there
is
also
another
river
called
phoinix
to
the
south
of
the
asopos
of
no
great
size
which
flowing
from
these
mountains
runs
out
into
the
asopos
and
at
the
river
phoinix
is
the
narrowest
place
for
here
has
been
constructed
a
road
with
a
single
only
then
from
the
river
phoinix
it
is
a
distance
of
fifteen
furlongs
to
thermopylai
and
in
the
space
between
the
river
phoinix
and
thermopylai
there
is
a
village
called
anthela
by
which
the
river
asopos
flows
and
so
runs
out
into
the
sea
and
about
this
village
there
is
a
wide
space
in
which
is
set
up
a
temple
dedicated
to
demeter
of
the
amphictyons
and
there
are
seats
for
the
amphictyonic
councillors
and
a
temple
dedicated
to
amphictyon
himself
king
xerxes
i
say
was
encamped
within
the
region
of
trachis
in
the
land
of
the
malians
and
the
hellenes
within
the
pass
this
place
is
called
by
the
hellenes
in
general
thermopylai
but
by
the
natives
of
the
place
and
those
who
dwell
in
the
country
round
it
is
called
pylai
both
sides
then
were
encamped
hereabout
and
the
one
had
command
of
all
that
lies
beyond
trachis
in
the
direction
of
the
north
wind
and
the
others
of
that
which
tends
towards
the
south
wind
and
the
on
this
side
of
the
continent
these
were
the
hellenes
who
awaited
the
attack
of
the
persian
in
this
place
of
the
spartans
three
hundred
hoplites
of
the
men
of
tegea
and
mantineia
a
thousand
half
from
each
place
from
orchomenos
in
arcadia
a
hundred
and
twenty
and
from
the
rest
of
arcadia
a
thousand
of
the
arcadians
so
many
from
corinth
four
hundred
from
phlius
two
hundred
and
of
the
men
of
mykene
eighty
these
were
they
who
came
from
the
peloponnese
and
from
the
boeotians
seven
hundred
of
the
thespians
and
of
the
thebans
four
hundred
in
addition
to
these
the
locrians
of
opus
had
been
summoned
to
come
in
their
full
force
and
of
the
phokians
a
thousand
for
the
hellenes
had
of
themselves
sent
a
summons
to
them
saying
by
messengers
that
they
had
come
as
forerunners
of
the
others
that
the
rest
of
the
allies
were
to
be
expected
every
day
that
their
sea
was
safely
guarded
being
watched
by
the
athenians
and
the
eginetans
and
by
those
who
had
been
appointed
to
serve
in
the
fleet
and
that
they
need
fear
nothing
for
he
was
not
a
god
they
said
who
was
coming
to
attack
hellas
but
a
man
and
there
was
no
mortal
nor
would
be
any
with
those
fortunes
evil
had
not
been
mingled
at
his
very
birth
and
the
greatest
evils
for
the
greatest
men
therefore
he
also
who
was
marching
against
them
being
mortal
would
be
destined
to
fail
of
his
expectation
they
accordingly
hearing
this
came
to
the
assistance
of
the
others
at
trachis
of
these
troops
although
there
were
other
commanders
also
according
to
the
state
to
which
each
belonged
yet
he
who
was
most
held
in
regard
and
who
was
leader
of
the
whole
army
was
the
lacedemonian
leonidas
son
of
anaxandrides
son
of
leon
son
of
eurycratides
son
of
anaxander
son
of
eurycrates
son
of
polydoros
son
of
alcamenes
son
of
teleclos
son
of
archelaos
son
of
hegesilaos
son
of
doryssos
son
of
leobotes
son
of
echestratos
son
of
agis
son
of
eurysthenes
son
of
aristodemos
son
of
aristomachos
son
of
cleodaios
son
of
hyllos
son
of
heracles
who
had
obtained
the
kingdom
of
sparta
contrary
to
expectation
for
as
he
had
two
brothers
each
older
than
himself
namely
cleomenes
and
dorieos
he
had
been
far
removed
from
the
thought
of
becoming
king
since
however
cleomenes
had
died
without
male
child
and
dorieos
was
then
no
longer
alive
but
he
also
had
brought
his
life
to
an
end
in
sicily
thus
the
kingdom
came
to
leonidas
both
because
was
of
elder
birth
than
cleombrotos
for
cleombrotos
was
the
youngest
of
the
sons
of
anaxandrides
and
also
because
he
had
in
marriage
the
daughter
of
cleomenes
he
then
at
this
time
went
to
thermopylai
having
chosen
the
three
hundred
who
were
appointed
by
law
and
men
who
chanced
to
have
sons
and
he
took
with
him
besides
before
he
arrived
those
thebans
whom
i
mentioned
when
i
reckoned
them
in
the
number
of
the
troops
of
whom
the
commander
was
leontiades
the
son
of
eurymachos
and
for
this
reason
leonidas
was
anxious
to
take
up
these
with
him
of
all
the
hellenes
namely
because
accusations
had
been
strongly
brought
against
them
that
they
were
taking
the
side
of
the
medes
therefore
he
summoned
them
to
the
war
desiring
to
know
whether
they
would
send
troops
with
them
or
whether
they
would
openly
renounce
the
alliance
of
the
hellenes
and
they
sent
men
having
other
thoughts
in
their
mind
the
while
these
with
leonidas
the
spartans
had
sent
out
first
in
order
that
seeing
them
the
other
allies
might
join
in
the
campaign
and
for
fear
that
they
also
might
take
the
side
of
the
medes
if
they
heard
that
the
spartans
were
putting
off
their
action
afterwards
however
when
they
had
kept
the
festival
for
the
festival
of
the
carneia
stood
in
their
way
they
intended
then
to
leave
a
garrison
in
sparta
and
to
come
to
help
in
full
force
with
speed
and
just
so
also
the
rest
of
the
allies
had
thought
of
doing
themselves
for
it
chanced
that
the
olympic
festival
fell
at
the
same
time
as
these
events
accordingly
since
they
did
not
suppose
that
the
fighting
in
thermopylai
would
so
soon
be
decided
they
sent
only
the
forerunners
of
their
force
these
i
say
had
intended
to
do
thus
and
meanwhile
the
hellenes
at
thermopylai
when
the
persian
had
come
near
to
the
pass
were
in
dread
and
deliberated
about
making
retreat
from
their
position
to
the
rest
of
the
peloponnesians
then
it
seemed
best
that
they
should
go
to
the
peloponnese
and
hold
the
isthmus
in
guard
but
leonidas
when
the
phokians
and
locrians
were
indignant
at
this
opinion
gave
his
vote
for
remaining
there
and
for
sending
at
the
same
time
messengers
to
the
several
states
bidding
them
to
come
up
to
help
them
since
they
were
but
few
to
repel
the
army
of
the
medes
as
they
were
thus
deliberating
xerxes
sent
a
scout
on
horseback
to
see
how
many
they
were
in
number
and
what
they
were
doing
for
he
had
heard
while
he
was
yet
in
thessaly
that
there
had
been
assembled
in
this
place
a
small
force
and
that
the
leaders
of
it
were
lacedemonians
together
with
leonidas
who
was
of
the
race
of
heracles
and
when
the
horseman
had
ridden
up
towards
their
camp
he
looked
upon
them
and
had
a
view
not
indeed
of
the
whole
of
their
army
for
of
those
which
were
posted
within
the
wall
which
they
had
repaired
and
were
keeping
a
guard
it
was
not
possible
to
have
a
view
but
he
observed
those
who
were
outside
whose
station
was
in
front
of
the
wall
and
it
chanced
at
that
time
that
the
lacedemonians
were
they
who
were
posted
outside
so
then
he
saw
some
of
the
men
practising
athletic
exercises
and
some
combing
their
long
hair
and
as
he
looked
upon
these
things
he
marvelled
and
at
the
same
time
he
observed
their
number
and
when
he
had
observed
all
exactly
he
rode
back
unmolested
for
no
one
attempted
to
pursue
him
and
he
found
himself
treated
with
much
indifference
and
when
he
returned
he
reported
to
xerxes
all
that
which
he
had
seen
hearing
this
xerxes
was
not
able
to
conjecture
the
truth
about
the
matter
namely
that
they
were
preparing
themselves
to
die
and
to
deal
death
to
the
enemy
so
far
as
they
might
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
they
were
acting
in
a
manner
merely
ridiculous
and
therefore
he
sent
for
demaratos
the
son
of
ariston
who
was
in
his
camp
and
when
he
came
xerxes
asked
him
of
these
things
severally
desiring
to
discover
what
this
was
which
the
lacedemonians
were
doing
and
he
said
thou
didst
hear
from
my
mouth
at
a
former
time
when
we
were
setting
forth
to
go
against
hellas
the
things
concerning
these
men
and
having
heard
them
thou
madest
me
an
object
of
laughter
because
i
told
thee
of
these
things
which
i
perceived
would
come
to
pass
for
to
me
it
is
the
greatest
of
all
ends
to
speak
the
truth
continually
before
thee
o
king
hear
then
now
also
these
men
have
come
to
fight
with
us
for
the
passage
and
this
is
it
that
they
are
preparing
to
do
for
they
have
a
custom
which
is
as
follows
whenever
they
are
about
to
put
their
lives
in
peril
then
they
attend
to
the
arrangement
of
their
hair
be
assured
however
that
if
thou
shalt
subdue
these
and
the
rest
of
them
which
remain
behind
in
sparta
there
is
no
other
race
of
men
which
will
await
thy
onset
o
king
or
will
raise
hands
against
thee
for
now
thou
art
about
to
fight
against
the
noblest
kingdom
and
city
of
those
which
are
among
the
hellenes
and
the
best
men
to
xerxes
that
which
was
said
seemed
to
be
utterly
incredible
and
he
asked
again
a
second
time
in
what
manner
being
so
few
they
would
fight
with
his
host
he
said
o
king
deal
with
me
as
with
a
liar
if
thou
find
not
that
these
things
come
to
pass
as
i
say
thus
saying
he
did
not
convince
xerxes
who
let
four
days
go
by
expecting
always
that
they
would
take
to
flight
but
on
the
fifth
day
when
they
did
not
depart
but
remained
being
obstinate
as
he
thought
in
impudence
and
folly
he
was
enraged
and
sent
against
them
the
medes
and
the
kissians
charging
them
to
take
the
men
alive
and
bring
them
into
his
presence
then
when
the
medes
moved
forward
and
attacked
the
hellenes
there
fell
many
of
them
and
others
kept
coming
up
continually
and
they
were
not
driven
back
though
suffering
great
loss
and
they
made
it
evident
to
every
man
and
to
the
king
himself
not
least
of
all
that
human
beings
are
many
but
men
are
few
this
combat
went
on
throughout
the
day
and
when
the
medes
were
being
roughly
handled
then
these
retired
from
the
battle
and
the
persians
those
namely
whom
the
king
called
immortals
of
whom
hydarnes
was
commander
took
their
place
and
came
to
the
attack
supposing
that
they
at
least
would
easily
overcome
the
enemy
when
however
these
also
engaged
in
combat
with
the
hellenes
they
gained
no
more
success
than
the
median
troops
but
the
same
as
they
seeing
that
they
were
fighting
in
a
place
with
a
narrow
passage
using
shorter
spears
than
the
hellenes
and
not
being
able
to
take
advantage
of
their
superior
numbers
the
lacedemonians
meanwhile
were
fighting
in
a
memorable
fashion
and
besides
other
things
of
which
they
made
display
being
men
perfectly
skilled
in
fighting
opposed
to
men
who
were
unskilled
they
would
turn
their
backs
to
the
enemy
and
make
a
pretence
of
taking
to
flight
and
the
barbarians
seeing
them
thus
taking
a
flight
would
follow
after
them
with
shouting
and
clashing
of
arms
then
the
lacedemonians
when
they
were
being
caught
up
turned
and
faced
the
barbarians
and
thus
turning
round
they
would
slay
innumerable
multitudes
of
the
persians
and
there
fell
also
at
these
times
a
few
of
the
spartans
themselves
so
as
the
persians
were
not
able
to
obtain
any
success
by
making
trial
of
the
entrance
and
attacking
it
by
divisions
and
every
way
they
retired
back
and
during
these
onsets
it
is
said
that
the
king
looking
on
three
times
leapt
up
from
his
seat
struck
with
fear
for
his
army
thus
they
contended
then
and
on
the
following
day
the
barbarians
strove
with
no
better
success
for
because
the
men
opposed
to
them
were
few
in
number
they
engaged
in
battle
with
the
expectation
that
they
would
be
found
to
be
disabled
and
would
not
be
capable
any
longer
of
raising
their
hands
against
them
in
fight
the
hellenes
however
were
ordered
by
companies
as
well
as
by
nations
and
they
fought
successively
each
in
turn
excepting
the
phokians
for
these
were
posted
upon
the
mountain
to
guard
the
path
so
the
persians
finding
nothing
different
from
that
which
they
had
seen
on
the
former
day
retired
back
from
the
fight
then
when
the
king
was
in
a
strait
as
to
what
he
should
do
in
the
matter
before
him
epialtes
the
son
of
eurydemos
a
malian
came
to
speech
with
him
supposing
that
he
would
win
a
very
great
reward
from
the
king
and
this
man
told
him
of
the
path
which
leads
over
the
mountain
to
thermopylai
and
brought
about
the
destruction
of
those
hellenes
who
remained
in
that
place
afterwards
from
fear
of
the
lacedemonians
he
fled
to
thessaly
and
when
he
had
fled
a
price
was
proclaimed
for
his
life
by
the
deputies
when
the
amphictyons
met
for
their
assembly
at
pylai
then
some
time
afterwards
having
returned
to
antikyra
he
was
slain
by
athenades
a
man
of
trachis
now
this
athenades
killed
epialtes
for
another
cause
which
i
shall
set
forth
in
the
following
part
of
the
history
but
he
was
honoured
for
it
none
the
less
by
the
lacedemonians
thus
epialtes
after
these
events
was
slain
there
is
however
another
tale
told
that
onetes
the
son
of
phanagoras
a
man
of
carystos
and
corydallos
of
antikyra
were
those
who
showed
the
persians
the
way
round
the
mountain
but
this
i
can
by
no
means
accept
for
first
we
must
judge
by
this
fact
namely
that
the
deputies
of
the
hellenes
did
not
proclaim
a
price
for
the
lives
of
onetes
and
corydallos
but
for
that
of
epialtes
the
trachinian
having
surely
obtained
the
most
exact
information
of
the
matter
and
secondly
we
know
that
epialtes
was
an
exile
from
his
country
to
avoid
this
charge
true
it
is
indeed
that
onetes
might
know
of
this
path
even
though
he
were
not
a
malian
if
he
had
had
much
intercourse
with
the
country
but
epialtes
it
was
who
led
them
round
the
mountain
by
the
path
and
him
therefore
i
write
down
as
the
guilty
man
xerxes
accordingly
being
pleased
by
that
which
epialtes
engaged
to
accomplish
at
once
with
great
joy
proceeded
to
send
hydarnes
and
the
men
of
whom
hydarnes
was
commander
and
they
set
forth
from
the
camp
about
the
time
when
the
lamps
are
lit
this
path
of
which
we
speak
had
been
discovered
by
the
malians
who
dwell
in
that
land
and
having
discovered
it
they
led
the
thessalians
by
it
against
the
phokians
at
the
time
when
the
phokians
had
fenced
the
pass
with
a
wall
and
thus
were
sheltered
from
the
attacks
upon
them
so
long
ago
as
this
had
the
pass
been
proved
by
the
malians
to
be
of
no
value
and
this
path
lies
as
follows
it
begins
from
the
river
asopos
which
flows
through
the
cleft
and
the
name
of
this
mountain
and
of
the
path
is
the
same
namely
anopaia
and
this
anopaia
stretches
over
the
ridge
of
the
mountain
and
ends
by
the
town
of
alpenos
which
is
the
first
town
of
the
locrians
towards
malis
and
by
the
stone
called
black
buttocks
and
the
seats
of
the
kercopes
where
is
the
very
narrowest
part
by
this
path
thus
situated
the
persians
after
crossing
over
the
asopos
proceeded
all
through
the
night
having
on
their
right
hand
the
mountains
of
the
oitaians
and
on
the
left
those
of
the
trachinians
and
when
dawn
appeared
they
had
reached
the
summit
of
the
mountain
in
this
part
of
the
mountain
there
were
as
i
have
before
shown
a
thousand
hoplites
of
the
phokians
keeping
guard
to
protect
their
own
country
and
to
keep
the
path
for
while
the
pass
below
was
guarded
by
those
whom
i
have
mentioned
the
path
over
the
mountain
was
guarded
by
the
phokians
who
had
undertaken
the
business
for
leonidas
by
their
own
offer
while
the
persians
were
ascending
they
were
concealed
from
these
since
all
the
mountain
was
covered
with
and
the
phokians
became
aware
of
them
after
they
had
made
the
ascent
as
follows
the
day
was
calm
and
not
a
little
noise
was
made
by
the
persians
as
was
likely
when
leaves
were
lying
spread
upon
the
ground
under
their
feet
upon
which
the
phokians
started
up
and
began
to
put
on
their
arms
and
by
this
time
the
barbarians
were
close
upon
them
these
when
they
saw
men
arming
themselves
fell
into
wonder
for
they
were
expecting
that
no
one
would
appear
to
oppose
them
and
instead
of
that
they
had
met
with
an
armed
force
then
hydarnes
seized
with
fear
lest
the
phokians
should
be
lacedemonians
asked
epialtes
of
what
people
the
force
was
and
being
accurately
informed
he
set
the
persians
in
order
for
battle
the
phokians
however
when
they
were
hit
by
the
arrows
of
the
enemy
which
flew
thickly
fled
and
got
away
at
once
to
the
topmost
peak
of
the
mountain
fully
assured
that
it
was
against
them
that
the
enemy
had
designed
to
come
and
here
they
were
ready
to
meet
death
these
i
say
were
in
this
mind
but
the
persians
meanwhile
with
epialtes
and
hydarnes
made
no
account
of
the
phokians
but
descended
the
mountain
with
all
speed
to
the
hellenes
who
were
in
thermopylai
first
the
soothsayer
megistias
after
looking
into
the
victims
which
were
sacrificed
declared
the
death
which
was
to
come
to
them
at
dawn
of
day
and
afterwards
deserters
brought
the
report
of
the
persians
having
gone
round
these
signified
it
to
them
while
it
was
yet
night
and
thirdly
came
the
who
had
run
down
from
the
heights
when
day
was
already
dawning
then
the
hellenes
deliberated
and
their
opinions
were
divided
for
some
urged
that
they
should
not
desert
their
post
while
others
opposed
this
counsel
after
this
they
departed
from
their
assembly
and
some
went
away
and
dispersed
each
to
their
several
cities
while
others
of
them
were
ready
to
remain
there
together
with
leonidas
however
it
is
reported
also
that
leonidas
himself
sent
them
away
having
a
care
that
they
might
not
perish
but
thinking
that
it
was
not
seemly
for
himself
and
for
the
spartans
who
were
present
to
leave
the
post
to
which
they
had
come
at
first
to
keep
guard
there
i
am
inclined
rather
to
be
of
this
latter
opinion
namely
that
because
leonidas
perceived
that
the
allies
were
out
of
heart
and
did
not
desire
to
face
the
danger
with
him
to
the
end
he
ordered
them
to
depart
but
held
that
for
himself
to
go
away
was
not
honourable
whereas
if
he
remained
a
great
fame
of
him
would
be
left
behind
and
the
prosperity
of
sparta
would
not
be
blotted
out
for
an
oracle
had
been
given
by
the
pythian
prophetess
to
the
spartans
when
they
consulted
about
this
war
at
the
time
when
it
was
being
first
set
on
foot
to
the
effect
that
either
lacedemon
must
be
destroyed
by
the
barbarians
or
their
king
must
lose
his
life
this
reply
the
prophetess
gave
them
in
hexameter
verses
and
it
ran
thus
but
as
for
you
ye
men
who
in
sparta
inhabit
either
your
glorious
city
is
sacked
by
the
children
of
perses
or
if
it
be
not
so
then
a
king
of
the
stock
heracleian
dead
shall
be
mourned
for
by
all
in
the
boundaries
of
broad
lacedemon
him
nor
the
might
of
bulls
nor
the
raging
of
lions
shall
hinder
for
he
hath
might
as
of
zeus
and
i
say
he
shall
not
be
restrained
till
one
of
the
other
of
these
he
have
utterly
torn
and
divided
i
am
of
opinion
that
leonidas
considering
these
things
and
desiring
to
lay
up
for
himself
glory
above
all
the
other
spartans
dismissed
the
allies
rather
than
that
those
who
departed
did
so
in
such
disorderly
fashion
because
they
were
divided
in
opinion
of
this
the
following
has
been
to
my
mind
a
proof
as
convincing
as
any
other
namely
that
leonidas
is
known
to
have
endeavoured
to
dismiss
the
soothsayer
also
who
accompanied
this
army
megistias
the
acarnanian
who
was
said
to
be
descended
from
melampus
that
he
might
not
perish
with
them
after
he
had
declared
from
the
victims
that
which
was
about
to
come
to
pass
for
them
he
however
when
he
was
bidden
to
go
would
not
himself
depart
but
sent
away
his
son
who
was
with
him
in
the
army
besides
whom
he
had
no
other
child
the
allies
then
who
were
dismissed
departed
and
went
away
obeying
the
word
of
leonidas
and
only
the
thespians
and
the
thebans
remained
behind
with
the
lacedemonians
of
these
the
thebans
stayed
against
their
will
and
not
because
they
desired
it
for
leonidas
kept
them
counting
them
as
hostages
but
the
thespians
very
willingly
for
they
said
that
they
would
not
depart
and
leave
leonidas
and
those
with
him
but
they
stayed
behind
and
died
with
them
the
commander
of
these
was
demophilos
the
son
of
diadromes
xerxes
meanwhile
having
made
libations
at
sunrise
stayed
for
some
time
until
about
the
hour
when
the
market
fills
and
then
made
an
advance
upon
them
for
thus
it
had
been
enjoined
by
epialtes
seeing
that
the
descent
of
the
mountain
is
shorter
and
the
space
to
be
passed
over
much
less
than
the
going
round
and
the
ascent
the
barbarians
accordingly
with
xerxes
were
advancing
to
the
attack
and
the
hellenes
with
leonidas
feeling
that
they
were
going
forth
to
death
now
advanced
out
much
further
than
at
first
into
the
broader
part
of
the
defile
for
when
the
fence
of
the
wall
was
being
guarded
they
on
the
former
days
fought
retiring
before
the
enemy
into
the
narrow
part
of
the
pass
but
now
they
engaged
with
them
outside
the
narrows
and
very
many
of
the
barbarians
fell
for
behind
them
the
leaders
of
the
divisions
with
scourges
in
their
hands
were
striking
each
man
ever
urging
them
on
to
the
front
many
of
them
then
were
driven
into
the
sea
and
perished
and
many
more
still
were
trodden
down
while
yet
alive
by
one
another
and
there
was
no
reckoning
of
the
number
that
perished
for
knowing
the
death
which
was
about
to
come
upon
them
by
reason
of
those
who
were
going
round
the
mountain
they
displayed
upon
the
barbarians
all
the
strength
which
they
had
to
its
greatest
extent
disregarding
danger
and
acting
as
if
possessed
by
a
spirit
of
recklessness
now
by
this
time
the
spears
of
the
greater
number
of
them
were
broken
so
it
chanced
in
this
combat
and
they
were
slaying
the
persians
with
their
swords
and
in
this
fighting
fell
leonidas
having
proved
himself
a
very
good
man
and
others
also
of
the
spartans
with
him
men
of
note
of
whose
names
i
was
informed
as
of
men
who
had
proved
themselves
worthy
and
indeed
i
was
told
also
the
names
of
all
the
three
hundred
moreover
of
the
persians
there
fell
here
besides
many
others
of
note
especially
two
sons
of
dareios
abrocomes
and
hyperanthes
born
to
dareios
of
phratagune
the
daughter
of
artanes
now
artanes
was
the
brother
of
king
dareios
and
the
son
of
hystaspes
the
son
of
arsames
and
he
in
giving
his
daughter
in
marriage
to
dareios
gave
also
with
her
all
his
substance
because
she
was
his
only
child
two
brothers
of
xerxes
i
say
fell
here
fighting
and
meanwhile
over
the
body
of
leonidas
there
arose
a
great
struggle
between
the
persians
and
the
lacedemonians
until
the
hellenes
by
valour
dragged
this
away
from
the
enemy
and
turned
their
opponents
to
flight
four
times
this
conflict
continued
until
those
who
had
gone
with
epialtes
came
up
and
when
the
hellenes
learnt
that
these
had
come
from
that
moment
the
nature
of
the
combat
was
changed
for
they
retired
backwards
to
the
narrow
part
of
the
way
and
having
passed
by
the
wall
they
went
and
placed
themselves
upon
the
hillock
all
in
a
body
together
except
only
the
thebans
now
this
hillock
is
in
the
entrance
where
now
the
stone
lion
is
placed
for
leonidas
on
this
spot
while
defending
themselves
with
daggers
that
is
those
who
still
had
them
left
and
also
with
hands
and
with
teeth
they
were
overwhelmed
by
the
missiles
of
the
barbarians
some
of
these
having
followed
directly
after
them
and
destroyed
the
fence
of
the
wall
while
others
had
come
round
and
stood
about
them
on
all
sides
such
were
the
proofs
of
valour
given
by
the
lacedemonians
and
thespians
yet
the
spartan
dienekes
is
said
to
have
proved
himself
the
best
man
of
all
the
same
who
as
they
report
uttered
this
saying
before
they
engaged
battle
with
the
medes
being
informed
by
one
of
the
men
of
trachis
that
when
the
barbarians
discharged
their
arrows
they
obscured
the
light
of
the
sun
by
the
multitude
of
the
arrows
so
great
was
the
number
of
their
host
he
was
not
dismayed
by
this
but
making
small
account
of
the
number
of
the
medes
he
said
that
their
guest
from
trachis
brought
them
very
good
news
for
if
the
medes
obscured
the
light
of
the
sun
the
battle
against
them
would
be
in
the
shade
and
not
in
the
sun
this
and
other
sayings
of
this
kind
they
report
that
dienekes
the
lacedemonian
left
as
memorials
of
himself
and
after
him
the
bravest
they
say
of
the
lacedemonians
were
two
brothers
alpheos
and
maron
sons
of
orsiphantos
of
the
thespians
the
man
who
gained
most
honour
was
named
dithyrambos
son
of
harmatides
the
men
were
buried
were
they
fell
and
for
these
as
well
as
for
those
who
were
slain
before
being
sent
away
by
leonidas
there
is
an
inscription
which
runs
thus
here
once
facing
in
fight
three
hundred
myriads
of
foemen
thousands
four
did
contend
men
of
the
peloponnese
this
is
the
inscription
for
the
whole
body
and
for
the
spartans
separately
there
is
this
stranger
report
this
word
we
pray
to
the
spartans
that
lying
here
in
this
spot
we
remain
faithfully
keeping
their
laws
this
i
say
for
the
lacedemonians
and
for
the
soothsayer
as
follows
this
is
the
tomb
of
megistias
renowned
whom
the
median
foemen
where
sperchios
doth
flow
slew
when
they
forded
the
stream
soothsayer
he
who
then
knowing
clearly
the
fates
that
were
coming
did
not
endure
in
the
fray
sparta
good
leaders
to
leave
the
amphictyons
it
was
who
honoured
them
with
inscriptions
and
memorial
pillars
excepting
only
in
the
case
of
the
inscription
to
the
soothsayer
but
that
of
the
soothsayer
megistias
was
inscribed
by
simonides
the
son
of
leoprepes
on
account
of
two
of
these
three
hundred
it
is
said
namely
eurystos
and
aristodemos
who
if
they
had
made
agreement
with
one
another
might
either
have
come
safe
home
to
sparta
together
seeing
that
they
had
been
dismissed
from
the
camp
by
leonidas
and
were
lying
at
alpenoi
with
disease
of
the
eyes
suffering
extremely
or
again
if
they
had
not
wished
to
return
home
they
might
have
been
slain
together
with
the
rest
when
they
might
i
say
have
done
either
one
of
these
two
things
would
not
agree
together
but
the
two
being
divided
in
opinion
eurystos
it
is
said
when
he
was
informed
that
the
persians
had
gone
round
asked
for
his
arms
and
having
put
them
on
ordered
his
helot
to
lead
him
to
those
who
were
fighting
and
after
he
had
led
him
thither
the
man
who
had
led
him
ran
away
and
departed
but
eurystos
plunged
into
the
thick
of
the
fighting
and
so
lost
his
life
but
aristodemos
was
left
behind
fainting
now
if
either
aristodemos
had
been
ill
alone
and
so
had
returned
home
to
sparta
or
the
men
had
both
of
them
come
back
together
i
do
not
suppose
that
the
spartans
would
have
displayed
any
anger
against
them
but
in
this
case
as
the
one
of
them
had
lost
his
life
and
the
other
clinging
to
an
excuse
which
the
first
also
might
have
used
had
not
been
willing
to
die
it
necessarily
happened
that
the
spartans
had
great
indignation
against
aristodemos
some
say
that
aristodemos
came
safe
to
sparta
in
this
manner
and
on
a
pretext
such
as
i
have
said
but
others
that
he
had
been
sent
as
a
messenger
from
the
camp
and
when
he
might
have
come
up
in
time
to
find
the
battle
going
on
was
not
willing
to
do
so
but
stayed
upon
the
road
and
so
saved
his
life
while
his
reached
the
battle
and
was
slain
when
aristodemos
i
say
had
returned
home
to
lacedemon
he
had
reproach
and
dishonour
and
that
which
he
suffered
by
way
of
dishonour
was
this
no
one
of
the
spartans
would
either
give
him
light
for
a
fire
or
speak
with
him
and
he
had
reproach
in
that
he
was
called
aristodemos
the
coward
he
however
in
the
battle
at
plataia
repaired
all
the
guilt
that
was
charged
against
him
but
it
is
reported
that
another
man
also
survived
of
these
three
hundred
whose
name
was
pantites
having
been
sent
as
a
messenger
to
thessaly
and
this
man
when
he
returned
back
to
sparta
and
found
himself
dishonoured
is
said
to
have
strangled
himself
the
thebans
however
of
whom
the
commander
was
leontiades
being
with
the
hellenes
had
continued
for
some
time
to
fight
against
the
king
army
constrained
by
necessity
but
when
they
saw
that
the
fortunes
of
the
persians
were
prevailing
then
and
not
before
while
the
hellenes
with
leonidas
were
making
their
way
with
speed
to
the
hillock
they
separated
from
these
and
holding
out
their
hands
came
near
to
the
barbarians
saying
at
the
same
time
that
which
was
most
true
namely
that
they
were
on
the
side
of
the
medes
and
that
they
had
been
among
the
first
to
give
earth
and
water
to
the
king
and
moreover
that
they
had
come
to
thermopylai
constrained
by
necessity
and
were
blameless
for
the
loss
which
had
been
inflicted
upon
the
king
so
that
thus
saying
they
preserved
their
lives
for
they
had
also
the
thessalians
to
bear
witness
to
these
words
however
they
did
not
altogether
meet
with
good
fortune
for
some
had
even
been
slain
as
they
had
been
approaching
and
when
they
had
come
and
the
barbarians
had
them
in
their
power
the
greater
number
of
them
were
branded
by
command
of
xerxes
with
the
royal
marks
beginning
with
their
leader
leontiades
the
same
whose
son
eurymachos
was
afterwards
slain
by
the
plataians
when
he
had
been
made
commander
of
four
hundred
thebans
and
had
seized
the
city
of
the
plataians
thus
did
the
hellenes
at
thermopylai
contend
in
fight
and
xerxes
summoned
demaratos
and
inquired
of
him
having
first
said
this
demaratos
thou
art
a
good
man
and
this
i
conclude
by
the
truth
of
thy
words
for
all
that
thou
saidest
turned
out
so
as
thou
didst
say
now
however
tell
me
how
many
in
number
are
the
remaining
lacedemonians
and
of
them
how
many
are
like
these
in
matters
of
war
or
are
they
so
even
all
of
them
he
said
o
king
the
number
of
all
the
lacedemonians
is
great
and
their
cities
are
many
but
that
which
thou
desirest
to
learn
thou
shalt
know
there
is
in
lacedemon
the
city
of
sparta
having
about
eight
thousand
men
and
these
are
all
equal
to
those
who
fought
here
the
other
lacedemonians
are
not
equal
to
these
but
they
are
good
men
too
to
this
xerxes
said
demaratos
in
what
manner
shall
we
with
least
labour
get
the
better
of
these
men
come
set
forth
to
us
this
for
thou
knowest
the
courses
of
their
counsels
seeing
that
thou
wert
once
their
king
he
made
answer
o
king
if
thou
dost
in
very
earnest
take
counsel
with
me
it
is
right
that
i
declare
to
thee
the
best
thing
what
if
thou
shouldest
send
three
hundred
ships
from
thy
fleet
to
attack
the
laconian
land
now
there
is
lying
near
it
an
island
named
kythera
about
which
chilon
who
was
a
very
wise
man
among
us
said
that
it
would
be
a
greater
gain
for
the
spartans
that
it
should
be
sunk
under
the
sea
than
that
it
should
remain
above
it
for
he
always
anticipated
that
something
would
happen
from
it
of
such
a
kind
as
i
am
now
setting
forth
to
thee
not
that
he
knew
of
thy
armament
beforehand
but
that
he
feared
equally
every
armament
of
men
let
thy
forces
then
set
forth
from
this
island
and
keep
the
lacedemonians
in
fear
and
while
they
have
a
war
of
their
own
close
at
their
doors
there
will
be
no
fear
for
thee
from
them
that
when
the
remainder
of
hellas
is
being
conquered
by
the
they
will
come
to
the
rescue
there
then
after
the
remainder
of
hellas
has
been
reduced
to
subjection
from
that
moment
the
lacedemonian
power
will
be
left
alone
and
therefore
feeble
if
however
thou
shalt
not
do
this
i
will
tell
thee
what
thou
must
look
for
there
is
a
narrow
isthmus
leading
to
the
peloponnese
and
in
this
place
thou
must
look
that
other
battles
will
be
fought
more
severe
than
those
which
have
taken
place
seeing
that
all
the
peloponnesians
have
sworn
to
a
league
against
thee
but
if
thou
shalt
do
the
other
thing
of
which
i
spoke
this
isthmus
and
the
cities
within
it
will
come
over
to
thy
side
without
a
battle
after
him
spoke
achaimenes
brother
of
xerxes
and
also
commander
of
the
fleet
who
chanced
to
have
been
present
at
this
discourse
and
was
afraid
lest
xerxes
should
be
persuaded
to
do
this
o
king
he
said
i
see
that
thou
art
admitting
the
speech
of
a
man
who
envies
thy
good
fortune
or
is
even
a
traitor
to
thy
cause
for
in
truth
the
hellenes
delight
in
such
a
temper
as
this
they
envy
a
man
for
his
good
luck
and
they
hate
that
which
is
stronger
than
themselves
and
if
besides
other
misfortunes
which
we
have
upon
us
seeing
that
four
hundred
of
our
ships
have
suffered
wreck
thou
shalt
send
away
another
three
hundred
from
the
station
of
the
fleet
to
sail
round
peloponnese
then
thy
antagonists
become
a
match
for
thee
in
fight
whereas
while
it
is
all
assembled
together
our
fleet
is
hard
for
them
to
deal
with
and
they
will
not
be
at
all
a
match
for
thee
and
moreover
the
whole
will
support
the
and
be
supported
by
it
if
they
proceed
onwards
together
but
if
thou
shalt
divide
them
neither
wilt
thou
be
of
service
to
them
nor
they
to
thee
my
determination
is
rather
to
set
thy
affairs
in
good
order
and
not
to
consider
the
affairs
of
the
enemy
either
where
they
will
set
on
foot
the
war
or
what
they
will
do
or
how
many
in
number
they
are
for
it
is
sufficient
that
they
should
themselves
take
thought
for
themselves
and
we
for
ourselves
likewise
and
if
the
lacedemonians
come
to
stand
against
the
persians
in
fight
they
will
assuredly
not
heal
the
wound
from
which
they
are
now
suffering
to
him
xerxes
made
answer
as
follows
achaimenes
i
think
that
thou
speakest
well
and
so
will
i
do
but
demaratos
speaks
that
which
he
believes
to
be
best
for
me
though
his
opinion
is
defeated
by
thine
for
i
will
not
certainly
admit
that
which
thou
saidest
namely
that
he
is
not
to
my
cause
judging
both
by
what
was
said
by
him
before
this
and
also
by
that
which
is
the
truth
namely
that
though
one
citizen
envies
another
for
his
good
fortune
and
shows
enmity
to
him
by
his
silence
nor
would
a
citizen
when
a
consulted
him
suggest
that
which
seemed
to
him
the
best
unless
he
had
attained
to
a
great
height
of
virtue
and
such
men
doubtless
are
few
yet
to
in
prosperity
is
as
nothing
else
on
earth
and
if
his
friend
should
consult
him
he
would
give
him
the
best
counsel
thus
then
as
regards
the
against
demaratos
that
is
to
say
about
one
who
is
my
i
bid
every
one
abstain
from
it
in
the
future
having
thus
said
xerxes
passed
in
review
the
bodies
of
the
dead
and
as
for
leonidas
hearing
that
he
had
been
the
king
and
commander
of
the
lacedemonians
he
bade
them
cut
off
his
head
and
crucify
him
and
it
has
been
made
plain
to
me
by
many
proofs
besides
but
by
none
more
strongly
than
by
this
that
king
xerxes
was
enraged
with
leonidas
while
alive
more
than
with
any
other
man
on
earth
for
otherwise
he
would
never
have
done
this
outrage
to
his
corpse
since
of
all
the
men
whom
i
know
the
persians
are
accustomed
most
to
honour
those
who
are
good
men
in
war
they
then
to
whom
it
was
appointed
to
do
these
things
proceeded
to
do
so
i
will
return
now
to
that
point
of
my
narrative
where
it
remained
unfinished
the
lacedemonians
had
been
informed
before
all
others
that
the
king
was
preparing
an
expedition
against
hellas
and
thus
it
happened
that
they
sent
to
the
oracle
at
delphi
where
that
reply
was
given
them
which
i
reported
shortly
before
this
and
they
got
this
information
in
a
strange
manner
for
demaratos
the
son
of
ariston
after
he
had
fled
for
refuge
to
the
medes
was
not
friendly
to
the
lacedemonians
as
i
am
of
opinion
and
as
likelihood
suggests
supporting
my
opinion
but
it
is
open
to
any
man
to
make
conjecture
whether
he
did
this
thing
which
follows
in
a
friendly
spirit
or
in
malicious
triumph
over
them
when
xerxes
had
resolved
to
make
a
campaign
against
hellas
demaratos
being
in
susa
and
having
been
informed
of
this
had
a
desire
to
report
it
to
the
lacedemonians
now
in
no
other
way
was
he
able
to
signify
it
for
there
was
danger
that
he
should
be
discovered
but
he
contrived
thus
that
is
to
say
he
took
a
folding
tablet
and
scraped
off
the
wax
which
was
upon
it
and
then
he
wrote
the
design
of
the
king
upon
the
wood
of
the
tablet
and
having
done
so
he
melted
the
wax
and
poured
it
over
the
writing
so
that
the
tablet
being
carried
without
writing
upon
it
might
not
cause
any
trouble
to
be
given
by
the
keepers
of
the
road
then
when
it
had
arrived
at
lacedemon
the
lacedemonians
were
not
able
to
make
conjecture
of
the
matter
until
at
last
as
i
am
informed
gorgo
the
daughter
of
cleomenes
and
wife
of
leonidas
suggested
a
plan
of
which
she
had
herself
thought
bidding
them
scrape
the
wax
and
they
would
find
writing
upon
the
wood
and
doing
as
she
said
they
found
the
writing
and
read
it
and
after
that
they
sent
notice
to
the
other
hellenes
these
things
are
said
to
have
come
to
pass

manner

this
is
the

of

elsewhere
in

and
it
would
be
rash
to
assign
to
it
any
other

it
is
true

that

the
latter
meaning
seems
to
me
preferable
whitelaw
suggests
to
me
that
epikarsios
epi

mean
rather
which
seems
to
be
its
meaning
in

odyss

and
from

be
obtained
the
idea
of

one

it
has
in

in

case
it

with

giving

then
confined
his
account
to
those

it
probable

while
the

with

these
were
those
who
joined
in
the
expedition
to
artemision
and
i
have
mentioned
them
according
to
the
number
of
the
ships
which
they
severally
supplied
so
the
number
of
the
ships
which
were
assembled
at
artemision
was
apart
from
the
galleys
two
hundred
and
and
the
commander
who
had
the
supreme
power
was
furnished
by
the
spartans
namely
eurybiades
son
of
eurycleides
since
the
allies
said
that
they
would
not
follow
the
lead
of
the
athenians
but
unless
a
lacedemonian
were
leader
they
would
break
up
the
expedition
which
was
to
be
made
for
it
had
come
to
be
said
at
first
even
before
they
sent
to
sicily
to
obtain
allies
that
the
fleet
ought
to
be
placed
in
the
charge
of
the
athenians
so
as
the
allies
opposed
this
the
athenians
yielded
having
it
much
at
heart
that
hellas
should
be
saved
and
perceiving
that
if
they
should
have
disagreement
with
one
another
about
the
leadership
hellas
would
perish
and
herein
they
judged
rightly
for
disagreement
between
those
of
the
same
race
is
worse
than
war
undertaken
with
one
consent
by
as
much
as
war
is
worse
than
peace
being
assured
then
of
this
truth
they
did
not
contend
but
gave
way
for
so
long
time
as
they
were
urgently
in
need
of
the
allies
and
that
this
was
so
their
conduct
proved
for
when
after
repelling
the
persian
from
themselves
they
were
now
contending
for
his
land
and
no
longer
for
their
own
they
alleged
the
insolence
of
pausanias
as
a
pretext
and
took
away
the
leadership
from
the
lacedemonians
this
however
took
place
afterwards
but
at
this
time
these
hellenes
also
who
had
come
to
artemision
when
they
saw
that
a
great
number
of
ships
had
put
in
to
aphetai
and
that
everything
was
filled
with
their
armament
were
struck
with
fear
because
the
fortunes
of
the
barbarians
had
different
issue
from
that
which
they
expected
and
they
deliberated
about
retreating
from
artemision
to
the
inner
parts
of
hellas
and
the
euboeans
perceiving
that
they
were
so
deliberating
asked
eurybiades
to
stay
there
by
them
for
a
short
time
until
they
should
have
removed
out
of
their
land
their
children
and
their
households
and
as
they
did
not
persuade
him
they
went
elsewhere
and
persuaded
themistocles
the
commander
of
the
athenians
by
a
payment
of
thirty
talents
the
condition
being
that
the
fleet
should
stay
and
fight
the
in
front
of
euboea
themistocles
then
caused
the
hellenes
to
stay
in
the
following
manner
eurybiades
he
imparted
five
talents
of
the
sum
with
the
pretence
that
he
was
giving
it
from
himself
and
when
eurybiades
had
been
persuaded
by
him
to
change
his
resolution
adeimantos
son
of
okytos
the
corinthian
commander
was
the
only
one
of
all
the
others
who
still
made
a
struggle
saying
that
he
would
sail
away
from
artemision
and
would
not
stay
with
the
others
to
him
therefore
themistocles
said
with
an
oath
thou
at
least
shalt
not
leave
us
for
i
will
give
thee
greater
gifts
than
the
king
of
the
medes
would
send
to
thee
if
thou
shouldest
desert
thy
allies
thus
he
spoke
and
at
the
same
time
he
sent
to
the
ship
of
adeimantos
three
talents
of
silver
so
these
all
had
been
persuaded
by
gifts
to
change
their
resolution
and
at
the
same
time
the
request
of
the
euboeans
had
been
gratified
and
themistocles
himself
gained
money
and
it
was
not
known
that
he
had
the
rest
of
the
money
but
those
who
received
a
share
of
this
money
were
fully
persuaded
that
it
had
come
from
the
athenian
state
for
this
purpose
thus
they
remained
in
euboea
and
fought
a
and
it
came
to
pass
as
follows
the
barbarians
had
arrived
at
aphetai
about
the
beginning
of
the
afternoon
having
been
informed
even
before
they
came
that
a
few
ships
of
the
hellenes
were
stationed
about
artemision
and
now
seeing
them
for
themselves
they
were
eager
to
attack
them
to
see
if
they
could
capture
them
now
they
did
not
think
it
good
yet
to
sail
against
them
directly
for
this
reason
fear
namely
that
the
hellenes
when
they
saw
them
sailing
against
them
should
set
forth
to
take
flight
and
darkness
should
come
upon
them
in
their
flight
and
so
they
were
likely
thought
the
persians
to
get
away
whereas
it
was
right
according
to
their
calculation
that
not
even
the
should
escape
and
save
his
life
with
a
view
to
this
then
they
contrived
as
follows
the
whole
number
of
their
ships
they
parted
off
two
hundred
and
sent
them
round
to
sail
by
caphereus
and
round
geriastos
to
the
euripos
going
outside
skiathos
so
that
they
might
not
be
sighted
by
the
enemy
as
they
sailed
round
euboea
and
their
purpose
was
that
with
these
coming
up
by
that
way
and
blocking
the
enemies
retreat
and
themselves
advancing
against
them
directly
they
might
surround
them
on
all
sides
having
formed
this
plan
they
proceeded
to
send
off
the
ships
which
were
appointed
for
this
and
they
themselves
had
no
design
of
attacking
the
hellenes
on
that
day
nor
until
the
signal
agreed
upon
should
be
displayed
to
them
by
those
who
were
sailing
round
to
show
that
they
had
arrived
these
ships
i
say
they
were
sending
round
and
meanwhile
they
were
numbering
the
rest
at
aphetai
during
this
time
while
these
were
numbering
their
ships
it
happened
thus
was
in
that
camp
a
man
of
skione
named
skyllias
as
a
diver
the
best
of
all
the
men
of
that
time
who
also
in
the
shipwreck
which
took
place
by
pelion
had
saved
for
the
persians
many
of
their
goods
and
many
of
them
also
he
had
acquired
for
himself
this
skyllias
it
appears
had
had
an
intention
even
before
this
of
deserting
to
the
side
of
the
hellenes
but
it
had
not
been
possible
for
him
to
do
so
then
in
what
manner
after
this
attempt
he
did
actually
come
to
the
hellenes
i
am
not
able
to
say
with
certainty
but
i
marvel
if
the
tale
is
true
which
is
reported
for
it
is
said
that
he
dived
into
the
sea
at
aphetai
and
did
not
come
up
till
he
reached
artemision
having
traversed
here
somewhere
about
eighty
furlongs
through
the
sea
now
there
are
told
about
this
man
several
other
tales
which
seem
likely
to
be
false
but
some
also
which
are
true
about
this
matter
however
let
it
be
stated
as
my
opinion
that
he
came
to
artemision
in
a
boat
then
when
he
had
come
he
forthwith
informed
the
commanders
about
the
shipwreck
how
it
had
come
to
pass
and
of
the
ships
which
had
been
sent
away
to
go
round
euboea
hearing
this
the
hellenes
considered
the
matter
with
one
another
and
after
many
things
had
been
spoken
the
prevailing
opinion
was
that
they
should
remain
there
that
day
and
encamp
on
shore
and
then
when
midnight
was
past
they
should
set
forth
and
go
to
meet
those
ships
which
were
sailing
round
after
this
however
as
no
one
sailed
out
to
attack
them
they
waited
for
the
coming
of
the
late
hours
of
the
afternoon
and
sailed
out
themselves
to
attack
the
barbarians
desiring
to
make
a
trial
both
of
their
manner
of
fighting
and
of
the
trick
of
breaking
their
line
and
seeing
them
sailing
thus
against
them
with
few
ships
not
only
the
others
in
the
army
of
xerxes
but
also
their
commanders
judged
them
to
be
moved
by
mere
madness
and
they
themselves
also
put
out
their
ships
to
sea
supposing
that
they
would
easily
capture
them
and
their
expectation
was
reasonable
enough
since
they
saw
that
the
ships
of
the
hellenes
were
few
while
theirs
were
many
times
as
numerous
and
sailed
better
setting
their
mind
then
on
this
they
came
round
and
enclosed
them
in
the
middle
then
so
many
of
the
ionians
as
were
kindly
disposed
to
the
hellenes
and
were
serving
in
the
expedition
against
their
will
counted
it
a
matter
of
great
grief
to
themselves
when
they
saw
them
being
surrounded
and
felt
assured
that
not
one
of
them
would
return
home
so
feeble
did
they
think
the
power
of
the
hellenes
to
be
while
those
to
whom
that
which
was
happening
was
a
source
of
pleasure
were
vying
with
one
another
each
one
endeavouring
to
be
the
first
to
take
an
athenian
ship
and
receive
gifts
from
the
king
for
in
their
camps
there
was
more
report
of
the
athenians
than
of
any
others
the
hellenes
meanwhile
when
the
signal
was
given
first
set
themselves
with
prows
facing
the
barbarians
and
drew
the
sterns
of
their
ships
together
in
the
middle
and
when
the
signal
was
given
a
second
time
although
shut
off
in
a
small
space
and
prow
against
prow
they
set
to
work
vigorously
and
they
captured
thirty
ships
of
the
barbarians
and
also
philaon
the
son
of
chersis
the
brother
of
gorgos
kind
of
the
salaminians
who
was
a
man
of
great
repute
in
the
army
now
the
first
of
the
hellenes
who
captured
a
ship
of
the
enemy
was
an
athenian
lycomedes
the
son
of
aischraios
and
he
received
the
prize
for
valour
so
these
as
they
were
contending
in
this
with
doubtful
result
were
parted
from
one
another
by
the
coming
on
of
night
the
hellenes
accordingly
sailed
away
to
artemision
and
the
barbarians
to
aphetai
the
contest
having
been
widely
different
from
their
expectation
in
this
antidoros
of
lemnos
alone
of
the
hellenes
who
were
with
the
king
deserted
to
the
side
of
the
hellenes
and
the
athenians
on
account
of
this
deed
gave
him
a
piece
of
land
in
salamis
when
the
darkness
had
come
on
although
the
season
was
the
middle
of
summer
yet
there
came
on
very
abundant
rain
which
lasted
through
the
whole
of
the
night
with
crashing
thunder
from
mount
pelion
and
the
dead
bodies
and
pieces
of
wreck
were
cast
up
at
aphetai
and
became
entangled
round
the
prows
of
the
ships
and
struck
against
the
blades
of
the
oars
and
the
men
of
the
army
who
were
there
hearing
these
things
became
afraid
expecting
that
they
would
certainly
perish
to
such
troubles
had
they
come
for
before
they
had
had
even
breathing
space
after
the
shipwreck
and
the
storm
which
had
arisen
off
mount
pelion
there
had
come
upon
them
a
hard
and
after
the
a
violent
storm
of
rain
and
strong
streams
rushing
to
the
sea
and
crashing
thunder
these
then
had
such
a
night
as
i
have
said
and
meanwhile
those
of
them
who
had
been
appointed
to
sail
round
euboea
experienced
the
very
same
night
but
against
them
it
raged
much
more
fiercely
inasmuch
as
it
fell
upon
them
while
they
were
making
their
course
in
the
open
sea
and
the
end
of
it
proved
distressful
to
them
for
when
the
storm
and
the
rain
together
came
upon
them
as
they
sailed
being
then
off
the
hollows
of
euboea
they
were
borne
by
the
wind
not
knowing
by
what
way
they
were
carried
and
were
cast
away
upon
the
rocks
and
all
this
was
being
brought
about
by
god
in
order
that
the
persian
force
might
be
made
more
equal
to
that
of
the
hellenes
and
might
not
be
by
very
much
the
larger
these
then
i
say
were
perishing
about
the
hollows
of
euboea
and
meanwhile
the
barbarians
at
aphetai
when
day
had
dawned
upon
them
of
which
they
were
glad
were
keeping
their
ships
quiet
and
were
satisfied
in
their
evil
plight
to
remain
still
for
the
present
time
but
to
the
hellenes
there
came
as
a
reinforcement
athenian
ships
the
coming
of
these
gave
them
more
courage
and
at
the
same
time
they
were
encouraged
also
by
a
report
that
those
of
the
barbarians
who
had
been
sailing
round
euboea
had
all
been
destroyed
by
the
storm
that
had
taken
place
they
waited
then
for
the
same
time
of
day
as
before
and
then
they
sailed
and
fell
upon
some
kilikian
ships
and
having
destroyed
these
they
sailed
away
when
the
darkness
came
on
and
returned
to
artemision
on
the
third
day
the
commanders
of
the
barbarians
being
exceedingly
indignant
that
so
small
a
number
of
ships
should
thus
do
them
damage
and
fearing
what
xerxes
might
do
did
not
wait
this
time
for
the
hellenes
to
begin
the
fight
but
passed
the
word
of
command
and
put
out
their
ships
to
sea
about
the
middle
of
the
day
now
it
so
happened
that
these
battles
at
sea
and
the
battles
on
land
at
thermopylai
took
place
on
the
same
days
and
for
those
who
fought
by
sea
the
whole
aim
of
the
fighting
was
concerned
with
the
channel
of
euripos
just
as
the
aim
of
leonidas
and
of
his
band
was
to
guard
the
pass
the
hellenes
accordingly
exhorted
one
another
not
to
let
the
barbarians
go
by
into
hellas
while
these
cheered
one
another
on
to
destroy
the
fleet
of
the
hellenes
and
to
get
possession
of
the
straits
now
while
the
forces
of
xerxes
were
sailing
in
order
towards
them
the
hellenes
kept
quiet
at
artemision
and
the
barbarians
having
made
a
crescent
of
their
ships
that
they
might
enclose
them
were
endeavouring
to
surround
them
then
the
hellenes
put
out
to
sea
and
engaged
with
them
and
in
this
battle
the
two
sides
were
nearly
equal
to
one
another
for
the
fleet
of
xerxes
by
reason
of
its
great
size
and
numbers
suffered
damage
from
itself
since
the
ships
were
thrown
into
confusion
and
ran
into
one
another
nevertheless
it
stood
out
and
did
not
give
way
for
they
disdained
to
be
turned
to
flight
by
so
few
ships
many
ships
therefore
of
the
hellenes
were
destroyed
and
many
men
perished
but
many
more
ships
and
men
of
the
barbarians
thus
contending
they
parted
and
went
each
to
their
own
place
in
this
the
egyptians
did
best
of
the
men
who
fought
for
xerxes
and
these
besides
other
great
deeds
which
they
displayed
captured
five
ships
of
the
hellenes
together
with
their
crews
while
of
the
hellenes
those
who
did
best
on
this
day
were
the
athenians
and
of
the
athenians
cleinias
the
son
of
alkibiades
who
was
serving
with
two
hundred
man
and
a
ship
of
his
own
furnishing
the
expense
at
his
own
proper
cost
having
parted
both
sides
gladly
hastened
to
their
moorings
and
after
they
had
separated
and
got
away
out
of
the
although
the
hellenes
had
possession
of
the
bodies
of
the
dead
and
of
the
wrecks
of
the
ships
yet
having
suffered
severely
and
especially
the
athenians
of
whose
ships
half
had
been
disabled
they
were
deliberating
now
about
retreating
to
the
inner
parts
of
hellas
themistocles
however
had
conceived
that
if
there
should
be
detached
from
the
force
of
the
barbarians
the
ionian
and
carian
nations
they
would
be
able
to
overcome
the
rest
and
when
the
people
of
euboea
were
driving
their
flocks
down
to
that
sea
he
assembled
the
generals
and
said
to
them
that
he
thought
he
had
a
device
by
which
he
hoped
to
cause
the
best
of
the
king
allies
to
leave
him
this
matter
he
revealed
to
that
extent
only
and
with
regard
to
their
present
circumstances
he
said
that
they
must
do
as
follows
one
must
slaughter
of
the
flocks
of
the
euboeans
as
many
as
he
wanted
for
it
was
better
that
their
army
should
have
them
than
the
enemy
moreover
he
advised
that
each
one
should
command
his
own
men
to
kindle
a
fire
and
as
for
the
time
of
their
departure
he
would
see
to
it
in
such
wise
that
they
should
come
safe
to
hellas
this
they
were
content
to
do
and
forthwith
when
they
had
kindled
a
fire
they
turned
their
attention
to
the
flocks
for
in
fact
the
euboeans
neglecting
the
oracle
of
bakis
as
if
it
had
no
meaning
at
all
had
neither
carried
away
anything
from
their
land
nor
laid
in
any
store
of
provisions
with
a
view
to
war
coming
upon
them
and
by
their
conduct
moreover
they
had
brought
trouble
upon
themselves
for
the
oracle
uttered
by
bakis
about
these
matters
runs
as
follows
mark
when
a
man
a
barbarian
shall
yoke
the
sea
with
papyrus
then
do
thou
plan
to
remove
the
goats
from
euboea
in
the
evils
which
at
this
time
were
either
upon
them
or
soon
to
be
expected
they
might
feel
not
a
little
sorry
that
they
had
paid
no
attention
to
these
lines
while
these
were
thus
engaged
there
came
to
them
the
scout
from
trachis
for
there
was
at
artemision
a
scout
named
polyas
by
birth
of
antikyra
to
whom
it
had
been
appointed
if
the
fleet
should
be
disabled
to
signify
this
to
those
at
thermopylai
and
he
had
a
vessel
equipped
and
ready
for
this
purpose
and
similarly
there
was
with
leonidas
abronichos
son
of
lysicles
an
athenian
ready
to
carry
news
to
those
at
artemision
with
a
galley
if
any
disaster
should
happen
to
the
this
abronichos
then
had
arrived
and
he
proceeded
to
signify
to
them
that
which
had
come
to
pass
about
leonidas
and
his
army
and
then
when
they
were
informed
of
it
no
longer
put
off
their
retreat
but
set
forth
in
the
order
in
which
they
were
severally
posted
the
corinthians
first
and
the
athenians
last
themistocles
however
selected
those
ships
of
the
athenians
which
sailed
best
and
went
round
to
the
springs
of
cutting
inscriptions
on
the
stones
there
which
the
ionians
read
when
they
came
to
artemision
on
the
following
day
these
inscriptions
ran
thus
ionians
ye
act
not
rightly
in
making
expedition
against
the
fathers
of
your
race
and
endeavouring
to
enslave
hellas
best
of
all
were
it
that
ye
should
come
and
be
on
our
side
but
if
that
may
not
be
done
by
you
stand
aside
even
now
from
the
combat
against
us
and
ask
the
carians
to
do
the
same
as
ye
if
however
neither
of
these
two
things
is
possible
to
be
done
and
ye
are
bound
down
by
too
strong
compulsion
to
be
able
to
make
revolt
then
in
the
action
when
we
engage
battle
be
purposely
slack
remember
that
ye
are
descended
from
us
and
that
our
quarrel
with
the
barbarian
took
its
rise
at
the
first
from
you
themistocles
wrote
thus
having
as
i
suppose
two
things
together
in
his
mind
namely
that
either
the
inscriptions
might
elude
the
notice
of
the
king
and
cause
the
ionians
to
change
and
come
over
to
the
side
on
which
he
was
or
that
having
been
reported
and
denounced
to
xerxes
they
might
cause
the
ionians
to
be
distrusted
by
him
and
so
he
might
keep
them
apart
from
the
themistocles
then
had
set
these
inscriptions
and
to
the
barbarians
there
came
immediately
after
these
things
a
man
of
histaia
in
a
boat
bringing
word
of
the
retreat
of
the
hellenes
from
artemision
they
however
not
believing
it
kept
the
messenger
under
guard
and
sent
ships
to
look
on
before
then
these
having
reported
the
facts
at
last
as
daylight
was
spreading
over
the
sky
the
whole
armament
sailed
in
a
body
to
artemision
and
having
stayed
at
this
place
till
after
this
they
sailed
to
histaia
and
there
arrived
they
took
possession
of
the
city
of
histaia
and
overran
all
the
villages
which
lie
along
the
coast
in
the
region
of
ellopia
which
is
the
land
of
histaia
while
they
were
there
xerxes
after
he
had
made
his
dispositions
with
regard
to
the
bodies
of
the
dead
sent
a
herald
to
the
fleet
and
the
dispositions
which
he
made
beforehand
were
as
follows
all
those
of
his
army
who
were
lying
dead
at
thermopylai
and
there
were
as
many
as
twenty
thousand
in
all
with
the
exception
of
about
a
thousand
whom
he
left
he
dug
trenches
and
buried
them
laying
over
them
leaves
and
heaping
earth
upon
them
that
they
might
not
be
seen
by
the
men
of
the
fleet
then
when
the
herald
had
gone
over
to
histaia
he
gathered
an
assembly
of
the
whole
force
and
spoke
these
words
allies
king
xerxes
grants
permission
to
any
one
of
you
who
desires
it
to
leave
his
post
and
to
come
and
see
how
he
fights
against
those
most
senseless
men
who
looked
to
overcome
the
power
of
the
king
when
the
herald
had
proclaimed
this
then
boats
were
of
all
things
most
in
request
so
many
were
they
who
desired
to
see
this
sight
and
when
they
had
passed
over
they
went
through
the
dead
bodies
and
looked
at
them
and
every
one
supposed
that
those
who
were
lying
there
were
all
lacedemonians
or
thespians
though
the
helots
also
were
among
those
that
they
saw
however
they
who
had
passed
over
did
not
fail
to
perceive
that
xerxes
had
done
that
which
i
mentioned
about
the
bodies
of
his
own
dead
for
in
truth
it
was
a
thing
to
cause
laughter
even
on
the
one
side
there
were
seen
a
thousand
dead
bodies
lying
while
the
others
lay
all
gathered
together
in
the
same
place
four
thousand
of
them
during
this
day
then
they
busied
themselves
with
looking
and
on
the
day
after
this
they
sailed
back
to
the
ships
at
histaia
while
xerxes
and
his
army
set
forth
upon
their
march
there
had
come
also
to
them
a
few
deserters
from
arcadia
men
in
want
of
livelihood
and
desiring
to
be
employed
these
the
persians
brought
into
the
king
presence
and
inquired
about
the
hellenes
what
they
were
doing
and
one
man
it
was
who
asked
them
this
for
all
the
rest
they
told
them
that
the
hellenes
were
keeping
the
olympic
festival
and
were
looking
on
at
a
contest
of
athletics
and
horsemanship
he
then
inquired
again
what
was
the
prize
proposed
to
them
for
the
sake
of
which
they
contended
and
they
told
them
of
the
wreath
of
olive
which
is
given
then
tigranes
the
son
of
artabanos
uttered
a
thought
which
was
most
noble
though
thereby
he
incurred
from
the
king
the
reproach
of
cowardice
for
hearing
that
the
prize
was
a
wreath
and
not
money
he
could
not
endure
to
keep
silence
but
in
the
presence
of
all
he
spoke
these
words
ah
mardonios
what
kind
of
men
are
these
against
whom
thou
hast
brought
us
to
fight
who
make
their
contest
not
for
money
but
for
honour
thus
was
it
spoken
by
this
man
in
the
meantime
so
soon
as
the
disaster
at
thermopylai
had
come
about
the
thessalians
sent
a
herald
forthwith
to
the
phokians
against
whom
they
had
a
grudge
always
but
especially
because
of
the
latest
disaster
which
they
had
suffered
for
when
both
the
thessalians
themselves
and
their
allies
had
invaded
the
phokian
land
not
many
years
before
this
expedition
of
the
king
they
had
been
defeated
by
the
phokians
and
handled
by
them
roughly
for
the
phokians
had
been
shut
up
in
mount
parnassos
having
with
them
a
soothsayer
tellias
the
eleian
and
this
tellias
contrived
for
them
a
device
of
the
following
kind
took
six
hundred
men
the
best
of
the
phokians
and
whitened
them
over
with
chalk
both
themselves
and
their
armour
and
then
he
attacked
the
thessalians
by
night
telling
the
phokians
beforehand
to
slay
every
man
whom
they
should
see
not
coloured
over
with
white
so
not
only
the
sentinels
of
the
thessalians
who
saw
these
first
were
terrified
by
them
supposing
it
to
be
something
portentous
and
other
than
it
was
but
also
after
the
sentinels
the
main
body
of
their
army
so
that
the
phokians
remained
in
possession
of
four
thousand
bodies
of
slain
men
and
shields
of
which
last
they
dedicated
half
at
abai
and
half
at
delphi
and
from
the
tithe
of
booty
got
by
this
battle
were
made
the
large
statues
which
are
contending
for
the
tripod
in
front
of
the
temple
at
delphi
and
others
similar
to
these
are
dedicated
as
an
offering
at
abai
thus
had
the
phokians
done
to
the
thessalian
footmen
when
they
were
besieged
by
them
and
they
had
done
irreparable
hurt
to
their
cavalry
also
when
this
had
invaded
their
land
for
in
the
pass
which
is
by
hyampolis
they
had
dug
a
great
trench
and
laid
down
in
it
empty
and
then
having
carried
earth
and
laid
it
on
the
top
and
made
it
like
the
rest
of
the
ground
they
waited
for
the
thessalians
to
invade
their
land
these
supposing
that
they
would
make
short
work
with
the
phokians
riding
in
full
course
fell
upon
the
and
there
the
legs
of
their
horses
were
utterly
crippled
bearing
then
a
grudge
for
both
of
these
things
the
thessalians
sent
a
herald
and
addressed
them
thus
phokians
we
advise
you
to
be
more
disposed
now
to
change
your
minds
and
to
admit
that
ye
are
not
on
a
level
with
us
for
in
former
times
among
the
hellenes
so
long
as
it
pleased
us
to
be
on
that
side
we
always
had
the
preference
over
you
and
now
we
have
such
great
power
with
the
barbarian
that
it
rests
with
us
to
cause
you
to
be
deprived
of
your
land
and
to
be
sold
into
slavery
also
we
however
though
we
have
all
the
power
in
our
hands
do
not
bear
malice
but
let
there
be
paid
to
us
fifty
talents
of
silver
in
return
for
this
and
we
will
engage
to
avert
the
dangers
which
threaten
to
come
upon
your
land
thus
the
thessalians
proposed
to
them
for
the
phokians
alone
of
all
the
people
in
those
parts
were
not
taking
the
side
of
the
medes
and
this
for
no
other
reason
as
i
conjecture
but
only
because
of
their
enmity
with
the
thessalians
and
if
the
thessalians
had
supported
the
cause
of
the
hellenes
i
am
of
opinion
that
the
phokians
would
have
been
on
the
side
of
the
medes
when
the
thessalians
proposed
this
they
said
that
they
would
not
give
the
money
and
that
it
was
open
to
them
to
take
the
median
side
just
as
much
as
the
thessalians
if
they
desired
it
for
other
reasons
but
they
would
not
with
their
own
will
be
traitors
to
hellas
when
these
words
were
reported
then
the
thessalians
moved
with
anger
against
the
phokians
became
guides
to
the
barbarian
to
show
him
the
way
and
from
the
land
of
trachis
they
entered
doris
for
a
narrow
strip
of
the
dorian
territory
extends
this
way
about
thirty
furlongs
in
breadth
lying
between
malis
and
phokis
the
region
which
was
in
ancient
time
called
dryopis
this
land
is
the
of
the
dorians
in
peloponnese
now
the
barbarians
did
not
lay
waste
this
land
of
doris
when
they
entered
it
for
the
people
of
it
were
taking
the
side
of
the
medes
and
also
the
thessalians
did
not
desire
it
when
however
from
doris
they
entered
phokis
they
did
not
indeed
capture
the
phokians
themselves
for
some
of
them
had
gone
up
to
the
heights
of
parnassos
that
summit
of
parnassos
is
very
convenient
to
receive
a
large
number
which
lies
by
itself
near
the
city
of
neon
the
name
of
it
being
tithorea
this
i
say
some
of
them
had
carried
up
their
goods
and
gone
up
themselves
but
most
of
them
had
conveyed
their
goods
out
to
the
ozolian
locrians
to
the
city
of
amphissa
which
is
situated
above
the
crissaian
plain
the
barbarians
however
overran
the
whole
land
of
phokis
for
so
the
thessalians
led
their
army
and
all
that
they
came
to
as
they
marched
they
burned
or
cut
down
and
delivered
to
the
flames
both
the
cities
and
the
temples
for
they
laid
everything
waste
proceeding
this
way
by
the
river
kephisos
and
they
destroyed
the
city
of
drymos
by
fire
and
also
the
following
namely
charadra
erochos
tethronion
amphikaia
neon
pedieis
triteis
elateia
hyampolis
parapotamioi
and
abai
at
which
place
there
was
a
temple
of
apollo
wealthy
and
furnished
with
treasuries
and
votive
offerings
in
abundance
and
there
was
then
as
there
is
even
now
the
seat
of
an
oracle
there
this
temple
they
plundered
and
burnt
some
also
of
the
phokians
they
pursued
and
captured
upon
the
mountains
and
some
women
they
did
to
death
by
repeated
outrage
passing
by
parapotamioi
the
barbarians
came
to
panopeus
and
from
this
point
onwards
their
army
was
separated
and
went
different
ways
the
largest
and
strongest
part
of
the
army
proceeding
with
xerxes
himself
against
athens
entered
the
land
of
the
boeotians
coming
into
the
territory
of
orchomenos
now
the
general
body
of
the
boeotians
was
taking
the
side
of
the
medes
and
their
cities
were
being
kept
by
macedonians
appointed
for
each
who
had
been
sent
by
alexander
and
they
were
keeping
them
this
aim
namely
in
order
to
make
it
plain
to
xerxes
that
the
boeotians
were
disposed
to
be
on
the
side
of
the
medes
these
i
say
of
the
barbarians
took
their
way
in
this
direction
but
others
of
them
with
guides
had
set
forth
to
go
to
the
temple
at
delphi
keeping
parnassos
on
their
right
hand
and
all
the
parts
of
phokis
over
which
these
marched
they
ravaged
for
they
set
fire
to
the
towns
of
panopeus
and
daulis
and
aiolis
and
for
this
reason
they
marched
in
that
direction
parted
off
from
the
rest
of
the
army
namely
in
order
that
they
might
plunder
the
temple
at
delphi
and
deliver
over
the
treasures
there
to
king
xerxes
and
xerxes
was
well
acquainted
with
all
that
there
was
in
it
of
any
account
better
i
am
told
than
with
the
things
which
he
had
left
in
his
own
house
at
home
seeing
that
many
constantly
reported
of
them
and
especially
of
the
votive
offerings
of
croesus
the
son
of
alyattes
meanwhile
the
delphians
having
been
informed
of
this
had
been
brought
to
extreme
fear
and
being
in
great
terror
they
consulted
the
oracle
about
the
sacred
things
whether
they
should
bury
them
in
the
earth
or
carry
them
forth
to
another
land
but
the
god
forbade
them
to
meddle
with
these
saying
that
he
was
able
by
himself
to
take
care
of
his
own
hearing
this
they
began
to
take
thought
for
themselves
and
they
sent
their
children
and
women
over
to
achaia
on
the
other
side
of
the
sea
while
most
of
the
men
themselves
ascended
up
towards
the
summits
of
parnassos
and
carried
their
property
to
the
corykian
cave
while
others
departed
for
refuge
to
amphissa
of
the
locrians
in
short
the
delphians
had
all
left
the
town
excepting
sixty
men
and
the
prophet
of
the
oracle
when
the
barbarians
had
come
near
and
could
see
the
temple
then
the
prophet
whose
name
was
akeratos
saw
before
the
cell
arms
lying
laid
out
having
been
brought
forth
out
of
the
sanctuary
which
were
sacred
and
on
which
it
was
not
permitted
to
any
man
to
lay
hands
he
then
was
going
to
announce
the
portent
to
those
of
the
delphians
who
were
still
there
but
when
the
barbarians
pressing
onwards
came
opposite
the
temple
of
athene
pronaia
there
happened
to
them
in
addition
portents
yet
greater
than
that
which
had
come
to
pass
before
for
though
that
too
was
a
marvel
that
arms
of
war
should
appear
of
themselves
laid
forth
outside
the
cell
yet
this
which
happened
straightway
after
that
is
worthy
of
marvel
even
beyond
all
other
prodigies
when
the
barbarians
in
their
approach
were
opposite
the
temple
of
athene
pronaia
at
this
point
of
time
from
the
heaven
there
fell
thunderbolts
upon
them
and
from
parnassos
two
crags
were
broken
away
and
rushed
down
upon
them
with
a
great
crashing
noise
falling
upon
many
of
them
while
from
the
temple
of
pronaia
there
was
heard
a
shout
and
a
was
raised
all
these
things
having
come
together
there
fell
fear
upon
the
barbarians
and
the
delphians
having
perceived
that
they
were
flying
came
down
after
them
and
slew
a
great
number
of
them
and
those
who
survived
fled
straight
to
boeotia
these
who
returned
of
the
barbarians
reported
as
i
am
informed
that
in
addition
to
this
which
we
have
said
they
saw
also
other
miraculous
things
for
two
men
they
said
in
full
armour
and
of
stature
more
than
human
followed
them
slaying
and
pursuing
these
two
the
delphians
say
were
the
native
heroes
phylacos
and
autonoös
whose
sacred
enclosures
are
about
the
temple
that
of
phylacos
being
close
by
the
side
of
the
road
above
the
temple
of
pronaia
and
that
of
autonoös
near
castalia
under
the
peak
called
hyampeia
moreover
the
rocks
which
fell
from
parnassos
were
still
preserved
even
to
my
time
lying
in
the
sacred
enclosure
of
athene
pronaia
into
which
they
fell
when
they
rushed
through
the
ranks
of
the
barbarians
such
departure
had
these
men
from
the
temple
meanwhile
the
fleet
of
the
hellenes
after
leaving
artemision
put
in
to
land
at
salamis
at
the
request
of
the
athenians
and
for
this
reason
the
athenians
requested
them
to
put
in
to
salamis
namely
in
order
that
they
might
remove
out
of
attica
to
a
place
of
safety
their
children
and
their
wives
and
also
deliberate
what
they
would
have
to
do
for
in
their
present
case
they
meant
to
take
counsel
afresh
because
they
had
been
deceived
in
their
expectation
for
they
had
thought
to
find
the
peloponnesians
in
full
force
waiting
for
the
barbarians
in
boeotia
they
found
however
nothing
of
this
but
they
were
informed
on
the
contrary
that
the
peloponnesians
were
fortifying
the
isthmus
with
a
wall
valuing
above
all
things
the
safety
of
the
peloponnese
and
keeping
this
in
guard
and
that
they
were
disposed
to
let
all
else
go
being
informed
of
this
the
athenians
therefore
made
request
of
them
to
put
in
to
salamis
the
others
then
put
in
their
ships
to
land
at
salamis
but
the
athenians
went
over
to
their
own
land
and
after
their
coming
they
made
a
proclamation
that
every
one
of
the
athenians
should
endeavour
to
save
his
children
and
household
as
best
he
could
so
the
greater
number
sent
them
to
troizen
but
others
to
egina
and
others
to
salamis
and
they
were
urgent
to
put
these
out
of
danger
both
because
they
desired
to
obey
the
oracle
and
also
especially
for
another
reason
which
was
this
athenians
say
that
a
great
serpent
lives
in
the
temple
and
guards
the
acropolis
and
they
not
only
say
this
but
also
they
set
forth
for
it
monthly
offerings
as
if
it
were
really
there
and
the
offering
consists
of
a
this
which
before
used
always
to
be
consumed
was
at
this
time
left
untouched
when
the
priestess
had
signified
this
the
athenians
left
the
city
much
more
and
with
greater
eagerness
than
before
seeing
that
the
goddess
also
had
as
they
supposed
left
the
acropolis
then
when
all
their
belongings
had
been
removed
out
of
danger
they
sailed
to
the
encampment
of
the
fleet
when
those
who
came
from
artemision
had
put
their
ships
in
to
land
at
salamis
the
remainder
of
the
naval
force
of
the
hellenes
being
informed
of
this
came
over
gradually
to
join
them
from
troizen
for
they
had
been
ordered
beforehand
to
assemble
at
pogon
which
is
the
harbour
of
the
troizenians
there
were
assembled
accordingly
now
many
more
ships
than
those
which
were
in
the
at
artemision
and
from
more
cities
over
the
whole
was
set
as
admiral
the
same
man
as
at
artemision
namely
eurybiades
the
son
of
eurycleides
a
spartan
but
not
of
the
royal
house
the
athenians
however
supplied
by
far
the
greatest
number
of
ships
and
those
which
sailed
the
best
the
following
were
those
who
joined
the
muster
peloponnese
the
lacedemonians
furnishing
sixteen
ships
the
corinthians
furnishing
the
same
complement
as
at
artemision
the
sikyonians
furnishing
fifteen
ships
the
epidaurians
ten
the
troizenians
five
the
men
of
hermion
three
these
all
except
the
hermionians
being
of
doric
and
makednian
race
and
having
made
their
last
migration
from
erineos
and
pindos
and
the
land
of
dryopis
but
the
people
of
hermion
are
dryopians
driven
out
by
heracles
and
the
malians
from
the
land
which
is
now
called
doris
these
were
the
peloponnesians
who
joined
the
fleet
and
those
of
the
mainland
outside
the
peloponnese
were
as
follows
athenians
furnishing
a
number
larger
than
all
the
rest
namely
one
hundred
and
eighty
ships
and
serving
alone
since
the
plataians
did
not
take
part
with
the
athenians
in
the
at
salamis
because
when
the
hellenes
were
departing
from
artemision
and
come
near
chalkis
the
plataians
disembarked
on
the
opposite
shore
of
boeotia
and
proceeded
to
the
removal
of
their
households
so
being
engaged
in
saving
these
they
had
been
left
behind
as
for
the
athenians
in
the
time
when
the
pelasgians
occupied
that
which
is
now
called
hellas
they
were
pelasgians
being
named
cranaoi
and
in
the
time
of
king
kecrops
they
came
to
be
called
kecropidai
then
when
erechtheus
had
succeeded
to
his
power
they
had
their
name
changed
to
athenians
and
after
ion
the
son
of
xuthos
became
commander
of
the
athenians
they
got
the
name
from
him
of
ionians
the
megarians
furnished
the
same
complement
as
at
artermision
the
amprakiots
came
to
the
assistance
of
the
rest
with
seven
ships
and
the
leucadians
with
three
these
being
by
race
dorians
from
corinth
of
the
islanders
the
eginetans
furnished
thirty
these
had
also
other
ships
manned
but
with
them
they
were
guarding
their
own
land
while
with
the
thirty
which
sailed
best
they
joined
in
the
at
salamis
now
the
eginetans
are
dorians
from
epidauros
and
their
island
had
formerly
the
name
of
oinone
after
the
eginetans
came
the
chalkidians
with
the
twenty
ships
which
were
at
artemision
and
the
eretrians
with
their
seven
these
are
ionians
next
the
keïans
furnishing
the
same
as
before
and
being
by
race
ionians
from
athens
the
naxians
furnished
four
ships
they
having
been
sent
out
by
the
citizens
of
their
state
to
join
the
persians
like
the
other
islanders
but
neglecting
these
commands
they
had
come
to
the
hellenes
urged
thereto
by
democritos
a
man
of
repute
among
the
citizens
and
at
that
time
commander
of
a
trireme
now
the
naxians
are
ionians
coming
originally
from
athens
the
styrians
furnished
the
same
ships
as
at
artemision
and
the
men
of
kythnos
one
ship
and
one
galley
these
both
being
dryopians
also
the
seriphians
the
siphnians
and
the
melians
served
with
the
rest
for
they
alone
of
the
islanders
had
not
given
earth
and
water
to
the
barbarian
these
all
who
have
been
named
dwelt
inside
the
land
of
the
thesprotians
and
the
river
acheron
for
the
thesprotians
border
upon
the
land
of
the
amprakiots
and
leucadians
and
these
were
they
who
came
from
the
greatest
distance
to
serve
but
of
those
who
dwell
outside
these
limits
the
men
of
croton
were
the
only
people
who
came
to
the
assistance
of
hellas
in
her
danger
and
these
sent
one
ship
of
whom
the
commander
was
phaÿlos
a
man
who
had
three
times
won
victories
at
the
pythian
games
now
the
men
of
croton
are
by
descent
achaians
all
the
rest
who
served
in
the
fleet
furnished
triremes
but
the
melians
siphnian
and
seriphians
galleys
the
melians
who
are
by
descent
from
lacedemon
furnished
two
the
siphnians
and
seriphians
who
are
ionians
from
athens
each
one
and
the
whole
number
of
the
ships
apart
from
the
galleys
was
three
hundred
and
when
the
commanders
had
assembled
at
salamis
from
the
states
which
have
been
mentioned
they
began
to
deliberate
eurybiades
having
proposed
that
any
one
who
desired
it
should
declare
his
opinion
as
to
where
he
thought
it
most
convenient
to
fight
a
in
those
regions
of
which
they
had
command
for
attica
had
already
been
let
go
and
he
was
now
proposing
the
question
about
the
other
regions
and
the
opinions
of
the
speakers
for
the
most
part
agreed
that
they
should
sail
to
the
isthmus
and
there
fight
a
in
defence
of
the
peloponnese
arguing
that
if
they
should
be
defeated
in
the
supposing
them
to
be
at
salamis
they
would
be
blockaded
in
an
island
where
no
help
would
come
to
them
but
at
the
isthmus
they
would
be
able
to
land
where
their
own
men
were
while
the
commanders
from
the
peloponnese
argued
thus
an
athenian
had
come
in
reporting
that
the
barbarians
were
arrived
in
attica
and
that
all
the
land
was
being
laid
waste
with
fire
for
the
army
which
directed
its
march
through
boeotia
in
company
with
xerxes
after
it
had
burnt
the
city
of
the
thespians
the
inhabitants
having
left
it
and
gone
to
the
peloponnese
and
that
of
the
plataians
likewise
had
now
come
to
athens
and
was
laying
waste
everything
in
those
regions
now
he
had
burnt
thespiai
and
plataia
because
he
was
informed
by
the
thebans
that
these
were
not
taking
the
side
of
the
medes
so
in
three
months
from
the
crossing
of
the
hellespont
whence
the
barbarians
began
their
march
after
having
stayed
there
one
month
while
they
crossed
over
into
europe
they
had
reached
attica
in
the
year
when
calliades
was
archon
of
the
athenians
and
they
took
the
lower
city
which
was
deserted
and
then
they
found
that
there
were
still
a
few
athenians
left
in
the
temple
either
stewards
of
the
temple
or
needy
persons
who
had
barred
the
entrance
to
the
acropolis
with
doors
and
with
a
palisade
of
timber
and
endeavoured
to
defend
themselves
against
the
attacks
of
the
enemy
being
men
who
had
not
gone
out
to
salamis
partly
because
of
their
poverty
and
also
because
they
thought
that
they
alone
had
discovered
the
meaning
of
the
oracle
which
the
pythian
prophetess
had
uttered
to
them
namely
that
the
bulwark
of
wood
should
be
impregnable
and
supposed
that
this
was
in
fact
the
safe
refuge
according
to
the
oracle
and
not
the
ships
so
the
persians
taking
their
post
upon
the
rising
ground
opposite
the
acropolis
which
the
athenians
call
the
hill
of
ares
proceeded
to
besiege
them
in
this
fashion
that
is
they
put
tow
round
about
their
arrows
and
lighted
it
and
then
shot
them
against
the
palisade
the
athenians
who
were
besieged
continued
to
defend
themselves
nevertheless
although
they
had
come
to
the
extremity
of
distress
and
their
palisade
had
played
them
false
nor
would
they
accept
proposals
for
surrender
when
the
sons
of
peisistratos
brought
them
forward
but
endeavouring
to
defend
themselves
they
contrived
several
contrivances
against
the
enemy
and
among
the
rest
they
rolled
down
large
stones
when
the
barbarians
approached
the
gates
so
that
for
a
long
time
xerxes
was
in
a
difficulty
not
being
able
to
capture
them
in
time
however
there
appeared
for
the
barbarians
a
way
of
approach
after
their
difficulties
since
by
the
oracle
it
was
destined
that
all
of
attica
which
is
on
the
mainland
should
come
to
be
under
the
persians
thus
then
it
happened
that
on
the
front
side
of
the
acropolis
behind
the
gates
and
the
way
up
to
the
entrance
in
a
place
where
no
one
was
keeping
guard
nor
would
one
have
supposed
that
any
man
could
ascend
by
this
way
here
men
ascended
by
the
temple
of
aglauros
the
daughter
of
kecrops
although
indeed
the
place
is
precipitous
and
when
the
athenians
saw
that
they
had
ascended
up
to
the
acropolis
some
of
them
threw
themselves
down
from
the
wall
and
perished
while
others
took
refuge
in
the
sanctuary
of
the
temple
then
those
of
the
persians
who
had
ascended
went
first
to
the
gates
and
after
opening
these
they
proceeded
to
kill
the
suppliants
and
when
all
had
been
slain
by
them
they
plundered
the
temple
and
set
fire
to
the
whole
of
the
acropolis
then
xerxes
having
fully
taken
possession
of
athens
sent
to
susa
a
mounted
messenger
to
report
to
artabanos
the
good
success
which
they
had
and
on
the
next
day
after
sending
the
herald
he
called
together
the
exiles
of
the
athenians
who
were
accompanying
him
and
bade
them
go
up
to
the
acropolis
and
sacrifice
the
victims
after
their
own
manner
whether
it
was
that
he
had
seen
some
vision
of
a
dream
which
caused
him
to
give
this
command
or
whether
perchance
he
had
a
scruple
in
his
mind
because
he
had
set
fire
to
the
temple
the
athenian
exiles
did
accordingly
that
which
was
commanded
them
and
the
reason
why
i
made
mention
of
this
i
will
here
declare
is
in
this
acropolis
a
temple
of
erechtheus
who
is
said
to
have
been
born
of
the
earth
and
in
this
there
is
an
and
a
sea
which
according
to
the
story
told
by
the
athenians
poseidon
and
athene
when
they
contended
for
the
land
set
as
witnesses
of
themselves
now
it
happened
to
this
to
be
set
on
fire
with
the
rest
of
the
temple
by
the
barbarians
and
on
the
next
day
after
the
conflagration
those
of
the
athenians
who
were
commanded
by
the
king
to
offer
sacrifice
saw
when
they
had
gone
up
to
the
temple
that
a
shoot
had
run
up
from
the
stock
of
the
tree
about
a
cubit
in
length
these
then
made
report
of
this
the
hellenes
meanwhile
at
salamis
when
it
was
announced
to
them
how
it
had
been
as
regards
the
acropolis
of
the
athenians
were
disturbed
so
greatly
that
some
of
the
commanders
did
not
even
wait
for
the
question
to
be
decided
which
had
been
proposed
but
began
to
go
hastily
to
their
ships
and
to
put
up
their
sails
meaning
to
make
off
with
speed
and
by
those
of
them
who
remained
behind
it
was
finally
decided
to
fight
at
sea
in
defence
of
the
isthmus
so
night
came
on
and
they
having
been
dismissed
from
the
council
were
going
to
their
ships
and
when
themistocles
had
come
to
his
ship
mnesiphilos
an
athenian
asked
him
what
they
had
resolved
and
being
informed
by
him
that
it
had
been
determined
to
take
out
the
ships
to
the
isthmus
and
fight
a
battle
by
sea
in
defence
of
the
peloponnese
he
said
then
if
they
set
sail
with
the
ships
from
salamis
thou
wilt
not
fight
any
more
at
all
for
the
fatherland
for
they
will
all
take
their
way
to
their
several
cities
and
neither
eurybiades
nor
any
other
man
will
be
able
to
detain
them
or
to
prevent
the
fleet
from
being
dispersed
and
hellas
will
perish
by
reason
of
evil
counsels
but
if
there
by
any
means
go
thou
and
try
to
unsettle
that
which
has
been
resolved
if
perchance
thou
mayest
persuade
eurybiades
to
change
his
plans
so
as
to
stay
here
this
advice
very
much
commended
itself
to
themistocles
and
without
making
any
answer
he
went
to
the
ship
of
eurybiades
having
come
thither
he
said
that
he
desired
to
communicate
to
him
a
matter
which
concerned
the
common
good
and
eurybiades
bade
him
come
into
his
ship
and
speak
if
he
desired
to
say
anything
then
themistocles
sitting
down
beside
him
repeated
to
him
all
those
things
which
he
had
heard
mnesiphilos
say
making
as
if
they
were
his
own
thoughts
and
adding
to
them
many
others
until
at
last
by
urgent
request
he
persuaded
him
to
come
out
of
his
ship
and
gather
the
commanders
to
the
council
so
when
they
were
gathered
together
before
eurybiades
proposed
the
discussion
of
the
things
for
which
he
had
assembled
the
commanders
themistocles
spoke
with
much
vehemence
being
very
eager
to
gain
his
end
and
as
he
was
speaking
the
corinthian
commander
adeimantos
the
son
of
okytos
said
themistocles
at
the
games
those
who
stand
forth
for
the
contest
before
the
due
time
are
beaten
with
rods
he
justifying
himself
said
yes
but
those
who
remain
behind
are
not
crowned
at
that
time
he
made
answer
mildly
to
the
corinthian
and
to
eurybiades
he
said
not
now
any
of
those
things
which
he
had
said
before
to
the
effect
that
if
they
should
set
sail
from
salamis
they
would
disperse
in
different
directions
for
it
was
not
seemly
for
him
to
bring
charges
against
the
allies
in
their
presence
but
he
held
to
another
way
of
reasoning
saying
now
it
is
in
thy
power
to
save
hellas
if
thou
wilt
follow
my
advice
which
is
to
stay
here
and
here
to
fight
a
and
if
thou
wilt
not
follow
the
advice
of
those
among
these
men
who
bid
thee
remove
the
ships
to
the
isthmus
for
hear
both
ways
and
then
set
them
in
comparison
if
thou
engage
battle
at
the
isthmus
thou
wilt
fight
in
an
open
sea
into
which
it
is
by
no
means
convenient
for
us
that
we
go
to
fight
seeing
that
we
have
ships
which
are
heavier
and
fewer
in
number
than
those
of
the
enemy
then
secondly
thou
wilt
give
up
to
destruction
salamis
and
megara
and
egina
even
if
we
have
success
in
all
else
for
with
their
fleet
will
come
also
the
and
thus
thou
wilt
thyself
lead
them
to
the
peloponnese
and
wilt
risk
the
safety
of
all
hellas
if
however
thou
shalt
do
as
i
say
thou
wilt
find
therein
all
the
advantages
which
i
shall
tell
thee
of
the
first
place
by
engaging
in
a
narrow
place
with
few
ships
against
many
if
the
fighting
has
that
issue
which
it
is
reasonable
to
expect
we
shall
have
very
much
the
better
for
to
fight
a
in
a
narrow
space
is
for
our
advantage
but
to
fight
in
a
wide
open
space
is
for
theirs
then
again
salamis
will
be
preserved
whither
our
children
and
our
wives
have
been
removed
for
safety
and
moreover
there
is
this
also
secured
thereby
to
which
ye
are
most
of
all
attached
namely
that
by
remaining
here
thou
wilt
fight
in
defence
of
the
peloponnese
as
much
as
if
the
fight
were
at
the
isthmus
and
thou
wilt
not
lead
the
enemy
to
peloponnese
if
thou
art
wise
then
if
that
which
i
expect
come
to
pass
and
we
gain
a
victory
with
our
ships
the
barbarians
will
not
come
to
you
at
the
isthmus
nor
will
they
advance
further
than
attica
but
they
will
retire
in
disorder
and
we
shall
be
the
gainers
by
the
preservation
of
megara
and
egina
and
salamis
at
which
place
too
an
oracle
tells
us
that
we
shall
get
the
victory
over
our
enemies
now
when
men
take
counsel
reasonably
for
themselves
reasonable
issues
are
wont
as
a
rule
to
come
but
if
they
do
not
take
counsel
reasonably
then
god
is
not
wont
generally
to
attach
himself
to
the
judgment
of
men
when
themistocles
thus
spoke
the
corinthian
adeimantos
inveighed
against
him
for
the
second
time
bidding
him
to
be
silent
because
he
had
no
native
land
and
urging
eurybiades
not
to
put
to
the
vote
the
proposal
of
one
who
was
a
citizen
of
no
city
for
he
said
that
themistocles
might
bring
opinions
before
the
council
if
he
could
show
a
city
belonging
to
him
but
otherwise
not
this
objection
he
made
against
him
because
athens
had
been
taken
and
was
held
by
the
enemy
then
themistocles
said
many
evil
things
of
him
and
of
the
corinthians
both
and
declared
also
that
he
himself
and
his
countrymen
had
in
truth
a
city
and
a
land
larger
than
that
of
the
corinthians
so
long
as
they
had
two
hundred
ships
fully
manned
for
none
of
the
hellenes
would
be
able
to
repel
the
athenians
if
they
came
to
fight
against
them
signifying
this
he
turned
then
to
eurybiades
and
spoke
yet
more
urgently
if
thou
wilt
remain
here
and
remaining
here
wilt
show
thyself
a
good
man
well
but
if
not
thou
wilt
bring
about
the
overthrow
of
hellas
for
upon
the
ships
depends
all
our
power
in
the
war
nay
but
do
as
i
advise
if
however
thou
shalt
not
do
so
we
shall
forthwith
take
up
our
households
and
voyage
to
siris
in
italy
which
is
ours
already
of
old
and
the
oracles
say
that
it
is
destined
to
be
colonised
by
us
and
ye
when
ye
are
left
alone
and
deprived
of
allies
such
as
we
are
will
remember
my
words
when
themistocles
thus
spoke
eurybiades
was
persuaded
to
change
his
mind
and
as
i
think
he
changed
his
mind
chiefly
from
fear
lest
the
athenians
should
depart
and
leave
them
if
he
should
take
the
ships
to
the
isthmus
for
if
the
athenians
left
them
and
departed
the
rest
would
be
no
longer
able
to
fight
with
the
enemy
he
chose
then
this
counsel
to
stay
in
that
place
and
decide
matters
there
by
a
thus
those
at
salamis
after
having
skirmished
with
one
another
in
speech
were
making
preparations
for
a
there
since
eurybiades
had
so
determined
and
as
day
was
coming
on
at
the
same
time
when
the
sun
rose
there
was
an
earthquake
felt
both
on
the
land
and
on
the
sea
and
they
determined
to
pray
to
the
gods
and
to
call
upon
the
sons
of
aiacos
to
be
their
helpers
and
as
they
had
determined
so
also
they
did
for
when
they
had
prayed
to
all
the
gods
they
called
ajax
and
telamon
to
their
help
from
salamis
where
the
fleet
was
and
sent
a
ship
to
egina
to
bring
aiacos
himself
and
the
rest
of
the
sons
of
aiacos
moreover
dicaios
the
son
of
theokydes
an
athenian
who
was
an
exile
and
had
become
of
great
repute
among
the
medes
at
this
time
declared
that
when
the
attic
land
was
being
ravaged
by
the
of
xerxes
having
been
deserted
by
the
athenians
he
happened
then
to
be
in
company
with
demaratos
the
lacedemonian
in
the
thriasian
plain
and
he
saw
a
cloud
of
dust
going
up
from
eleusis
as
if
made
by
a
company
of
about
thirty
thousand
men
and
they
wondered
at
the
cloud
of
dust
by
what
men
it
was
caused
then
forthwith
they
heard
a
sound
of
voices
and
dicaios
perceived
that
the
sound
was
the
mystic
cry
iacchos
but
demaratos
having
no
knowledge
of
the
sacred
rites
which
are
done
at
eleusis
asked
him
what
this
was
that
uttered
the
sound
and
he
said
demaratos
it
can
not
be
but
that
some
great
destruction
is
about
to
come
to
the
army
of
the
king
for
as
to
this
it
is
very
manifest
seeing
that
attica
is
deserted
that
this
which
utters
the
sound
is
of
the
gods
and
that
it
is
going
from
eleusis
to
help
the
athenians
and
their
allies
if
then
it
shall
come
down
in
the
peloponnese
there
is
danger
for
the
king
himself
and
for
the
army
which
is
upon
the
mainland
but
if
it
shall
direct
its
course
towards
the
ships
which
are
at
salamis
the
king
will
be
in
danger
of
losing
his
fleet
this
feast
the
athenians
celebrate
every
year
to
the
mother
and
the
daughter
and
he
that
desires
it
both
of
them
and
of
the
other
hellenes
is
initiated
in
the
mysteries
and
the
sound
of
voices
which
thou
hearest
is
the
cry
iacchos
which
they
utter
at
this
feast
to
this
demaratos
said
keep
silence
and
tell
not
this
tale
to
any
other
man
for
if
these
words
of
thine
be
reported
to
the
king
thou
wilt
surely
lose
thy
head
and
neither
i
nor
any
other
man
upon
earth
will
be
able
to
save
thee
but
keep
thou
quiet
and
about
this
expedition
the
gods
will
provide
he
then
thus
advised
and
after
the
cloud
of
dust
and
the
sound
of
voices
there
came
a
mist
which
was
borne
aloft
and
carried
towards
salamis
to
the
camp
of
the
hellenes
and
thus
they
learnt
said
he
that
the
fleet
of
xerxes
was
destined
to
be
destroyed
such
was
the
report
made
by
dicaios
the
son
of
theodykes
appealing
to
demaratos
and
others
also
as
witnesses
meanwhile
those
who
were
appointed
to
serve
in
the
fleet
of
xerxes
having
gazed
in
trachis
upon
the
disaster
of
the
lacedemonians
and
having
passed
over
from
thence
to
histiaia
after
staying
three
days
sailed
through
euripos
and
in
other
three
days
they
had
reached
phaleron
and
as
i
suppose
they
made
their
attack
upon
athens
not
fewer
in
number
both
by
land
and
sea
than
when
they
had
arrived
at
sepias
and
at
thermopylai
for
against
those
of
them
who
perished
by
reason
of
the
storm
and
those
who
were
slain
at
thermopylai
and
in
the
at
artemision
i
will
set
those
who
at
that
time
were
not
yet
accompanying
the
king
the
malians
dorians
locrians
and
boeotians
who
accompanied
him
in
a
body
except
the
thespians
and
plataians
and
moreover
those
of
carystos
andros
and
tenos
with
all
the
other
islanders
except
the
five
cities
of
which
i
mentioned
the
names
before
for
the
more
the
persian
advanced
towards
the
centre
of
hellas
the
more
nations
accompanied
him
so
then
when
all
these
had
come
to
athens
except
the
parians
now
the
parians
had
remained
behind
at
kythnos
waiting
to
see
how
the
war
would
turn
out
all
the
rest
i
say
had
come
to
phaleron
then
xerxes
himself
came
down
to
the
ships
desiring
to
visit
them
and
to
learn
the
opinions
of
those
who
sailed
in
them
and
when
he
had
come
and
was
set
in
a
conspicuous
place
then
those
who
were
despots
of
their
own
nations
or
commanders
of
divisions
being
sent
for
came
before
him
from
their
ships
and
took
their
seats
as
the
king
had
assigned
rank
to
each
one
first
the
king
of
sidon
then
he
of
tyre
and
after
them
the
rest
and
when
they
were
seated
in
due
order
xerxes
sent
mardonios
and
inquired
making
trial
of
each
one
whether
he
should
fight
a
battle
by
sea
so
when
mardonios
went
round
asking
them
beginning
with
the
king
of
sidon
the
others
gave
their
opinions
all
to
the
same
effect
advising
him
to
fight
a
battle
by
sea
but
artemisia
spoke
these
words
a
tell
the
king
i
pray
thee
mardonios
that
i
who
have
proved
myself
not
to
be
the
worst
in
the
which
have
been
fought
near
euboea
and
have
displayed
deeds
not
inferior
to
those
of
others
speak
to
him
thus
master
it
is
right
that
i
set
forth
the
opinion
which
i
really
have
and
say
that
which
i
happen
to
think
best
for
thy
cause
and
this
i
say
thy
ships
and
do
not
make
a
for
the
men
are
as
much
stronger
than
thy
men
by
sea
as
men
are
stronger
than
women
and
why
must
thou
needs
run
the
risk
of
hast
thou
not
athens
in
thy
possession
for
the
sake
of
which
thou
didst
set
forth
on
thy
march
and
also
the
rest
of
hellas
and
no
man
stands
in
thy
way
to
resist
but
those
who
did
stand
against
thee
came
off
as
it
was
fitting
that
they
should
b
now
the
manner
in
which
i
think
the
affairs
of
thy
adversaries
will
have
their
issue
i
will
declare
if
thou
do
not
hasten
to
make
a
but
keep
thy
ships
here
by
the
land
either
remaining
here
thyself
or
even
advancing
on
to
the
peloponnese
that
which
thou
hast
come
to
do
o
master
will
easily
be
effected
for
the
hellenes
are
not
able
to
hold
out
against
thee
for
any
long
time
but
thou
wilt
soon
disperse
them
and
they
will
take
flight
to
their
several
cities
since
neither
have
they
provisions
with
them
in
this
island
as
i
am
informed
nor
is
it
probable
that
if
thou
shalt
march
thy
against
the
peloponnese
they
who
have
come
from
thence
will
remain
still
for
these
will
have
no
care
to
fight
a
battle
in
defence
of
athens
c
if
however
thou
hasten
to
fight
forthwith
i
fear
that
damage
done
to
the
fleet
may
ruin
the
also
moreover
o
king
consider
also
this
that
the
servants
of
good
men
are
apt
to
grow
bad
but
those
of
bad
men
good
and
thou
who
art
of
all
men
the
best
hast
bad
servants
namely
those
who
are
reckoned
as
allies
egyptians
and
cyprians
and
kilikians
and
pamphylians
in
whom
there
is
no
profit
when
she
thus
spoke
to
mardonios
those
who
were
friendly
to
artemisia
were
grieved
at
her
words
supposing
that
she
would
suffer
some
evil
from
the
king
because
she
urged
him
not
to
fight
at
sea
while
those
who
had
envy
and
jealousy
of
her
because
she
had
been
honoured
above
all
the
allies
were
rejoiced
at
the
opposition
supposing
that
she
would
now
be
ruined
when
however
the
opinions
were
reported
to
xerxes
he
was
greatly
pleased
with
the
opinion
of
artemisia
and
whereas
even
before
this
he
thought
her
excellent
he
commended
her
now
yet
more
nevertheless
he
gave
orders
to
follow
the
advice
of
the
greater
number
thinking
that
when
they
fought
by
euboea
they
were
purposely
slack
because
he
was
not
himself
present
with
them
whereas
now
he
had
made
himself
ready
to
look
on
while
they
fought
a
so
when
they
passed
the
word
to
put
out
to
sea
they
brought
their
ships
out
to
salamis
and
quietly
ranged
themselves
along
the
shore
in
their
several
positions
at
that
time
the
daylight
was
not
sufficient
for
them
to
engage
battle
for
night
had
come
on
but
they
made
their
preparations
to
fight
on
the
following
day
meanwhile
the
hellenes
were
possessed
by
fear
and
dismay
especially
those
who
were
from
peloponnese
and
these
were
dismayed
because
remaining
in
salamis
they
were
to
fight
a
battle
on
behalf
of
the
land
of
the
athenians
and
being
defeated
they
would
be
cut
off
from
escape
and
blockaded
in
an
island
leaving
their
own
land
unguarded
and
indeed
the
of
the
barbarians
was
marching
forward
during
that
very
night
towards
the
peloponnese
yet
every
means
had
been
taken
that
the
barbarians
might
not
be
able
to
enter
peloponnesus
by
land
for
as
soon
as
the
peloponnesians
heard
that
leonidas
and
his
company
had
perished
at
thermopylai
they
came
together
quickly
from
the
cities
and
took
post
at
the
isthmus
and
over
them
was
set
as
commander
cleombrotos
the
son
of
anaxandrides
and
brother
of
leonidas
these
being
posted
at
the
isthmus
had
destroyed
the
skironian
way
and
after
this
having
so
determined
in
counsel
with
one
another
they
began
to
build
a
wall
across
the
isthmus
and
as
they
were
many
myriads
and
every
man
joined
in
the
work
the
work
proceeded
fast
for
stones
and
bricks
and
pieces
of
timber
and
baskets
full
of
sand
were
carried
to
it
continually
and
they
who
had
thus
come
to
help
paused
not
at
all
in
their
work
either
by
night
or
by
day
now
those
of
the
hellenes
who
came
in
full
force
to
the
isthmus
to
help
their
country
were
these
lacedemonians
the
arcadians
of
every
division
the
eleians
corinthians
sikyonians
epidaurians
phliasians
troizenians
and
hermionians
these
were
they
who
came
to
the
help
of
hellas
in
her
danger
and
who
had
apprehension
for
her
while
the
rest
of
the
peloponnesians
showed
no
care
and
the
olympic
and
carneian
festivals
had
by
this
time
gone
by
now
peloponnesus
is
inhabited
by
seven
races
and
of
these
two
are
natives
of
the
soil
and
are
settled
now
in
the
place
where
they
dwelt
of
old
namely
the
arcadians
and
the
kynurians
and
one
race
that
of
the
achaians
though
it
did
not
remove
from
the
peloponnese
yet
removed
in
former
time
from
its
own
land
and
dwells
now
in
that
which
was
not
its
own
the
remaining
races
four
in
number
have
come
in
from
without
namely
the
dorians
aitolians
dryopians
and
lemnians
of
the
dorians
there
are
many
cities
and
of
great
renown
of
the
aitolians
elis
alone
of
the
dryopians
hermion
and
asine
which
latter
is
opposite
cardamyle
in
the
laconian
land
and
of
the
lemnians
all
the
paroreatai
the
kynurians
who
are
natives
of
the
soil
seem
alone
to
be
ionians
but
they
have
become
dorians
completely
because
they
are
subject
to
the
argives
and
by
lapse
of
time
being
originally
citizens
of
orneai
or
the
dwellers
in
the
country
round
orneai
of
these
seven
nations
the
remaining
cities
except
those
which
i
enumerated
just
now
stood
aside
and
did
nothing
and
if
one
may
be
allowed
to
speak
freely
in
thus
standing
aside
they
were
in
fact
taking
the
side
of
the
medes
those
at
the
isthmus
were
struggling
with
the
labour
which
i
have
said
since
now
they
were
running
a
course
in
which
their
very
being
was
at
stake
and
they
did
not
look
to
have
any
brilliant
success
with
their
ships
while
those
who
were
at
salamis
though
informed
of
this
work
were
yet
dismayed
not
fearing
so
much
for
themselves
as
for
peloponnesus
for
some
time
then
they
spoke
of
it
in
private
one
man
standing
by
another
and
they
marvelled
at
the
of
eurybiades
but
at
last
it
broke
out
publicly
a
meeting
accordingly
was
held
and
much
was
spoken
about
the
same
points
as
before
some
saying
that
they
ought
to
sail
away
to
peloponnesus
and
run
the
risk
in
defence
of
that
and
not
stay
and
fight
for
a
land
which
had
been
captured
by
the
enemy
while
the
athenians
eginetans
and
megarians
urged
that
they
should
stay
there
and
defend
themselves
then
themistocles
when
his
opinion
was
like
to
be
defeated
by
the
peloponnesians
secretly
went
forth
from
the
assembly
and
having
gone
out
he
sent
a
man
to
the
encampment
of
the
medes
in
a
boat
charging
him
with
that
which
he
must
say
this
man
name
was
sikinnos
and
he
was
a
servant
of
themistocles
and
tutor
to
his
children
and
after
these
events
themistocles
entered
him
as
a
thespian
citizen
when
the
thespians
were
admitting
new
citizens
and
made
him
a
wealthy
man
he
at
this
time
came
with
a
boat
and
said
to
the
commanders
of
the
barbarians
these
words
the
commander
of
the
athenians
sent
me
privately
without
the
knowledge
of
the
other
hellenes
for
as
it
chances
he
is
disposed
to
the
cause
of
the
king
and
desires
rather
that
your
side
should
gain
the
victory
than
that
of
the
hellenes
to
inform
you
that
the
hellenes
are
planning
to
take
flight
having
been
struck
with
dismay
and
now
it
is
possible
for
you
to
execute
a
most
noble
work
if
ye
do
not
permit
them
to
flee
away
for
they
are
not
of
one
mind
with
one
another
and
they
will
not
stand
against
you
in
fight
but
ye
shall
see
them
fighting
a
battle
by
sea
with
one
another
those
who
are
disposed
to
your
side
against
those
who
are
not
he
then
having
signified
to
them
this
departed
out
of
the
way
and
they
thinking
that
the
message
deserved
credit
landed
first
a
large
number
of
persians
in
the
small
island
of
psyttaleia
which
lies
between
salamis
and
the
mainland
and
then
as
midnight
came
on
they
put
out
the
western
wing
of
their
fleet
to
sea
circling
round
towards
salamis
and
also
those
stationed
about
keos
and
kynosura
put
out
their
ships
to
sea
and
they
occupied
all
the
passage
with
their
ships
as
far
as
munychia
and
for
this
reason
they
put
out
their
ships
namely
in
order
that
the
hellenes
might
not
even
be
permitted
to
get
away
but
being
cut
off
in
salamis
might
pay
the
penalty
for
the
contests
at
artemision
and
they
disembarked
men
of
the
persians
on
the
small
island
called
psyttaleia
for
this
reason
namely
that
when
the
fight
should
take
place
these
might
save
the
men
of
one
side
and
destroy
those
of
the
other
since
there
especially
it
was
likely
that
the
men
and
the
wrecks
of
ships
would
be
cast
up
on
shore
for
the
island
lay
in
the
way
of
the
which
was
to
be
these
things
they
did
in
silence
that
the
enemy
might
not
have
information
of
them
they
then
were
making
their
preparations
thus
in
the
night
without
having
taken
any
sleep
at
all
and
with
regard
to
oracles
i
am
not
able
to
make
objections
against
them
that
they
are
not
true
for
i
do
not
desire
to
attempt
to
overthrow
the
credit
of
them
when
they
speak
clearly
looking
at
such
matters
as
these
which
here
follow
but
when
with
ships
they
shall
join
the
sacred
strand
of
the
goddess
artemis
and
thee
kynosura
urged
by
a
maddening
hope
having
given
rich
athens
to
plunder
then
shall
justice
divine
quell
riot
of
insolence
longing
to
overthrow
all
things
and
terribly
panting
for
bloodhshed
brass
shall
encounter
with
brass
and
ares
the
sea
shall
empurple
tinging
its
waves
with
the
blood
then
a
day
of
freedom
for
hellas
cometh
from
zeus
and
from
victory
lady
and
mother
looking
to
such
things
as
this
and
when
bakis
speaks
so
clearly
i
do
not
venture
myself
to
make
any
objections
about
oracles
nor
can
i
admit
them
from
others
now
between
the
commanders
that
were
at
salamis
there
came
to
be
great
contention
of
speech
and
they
did
not
yet
know
that
the
barbarians
were
surrounding
them
with
their
ships
but
they
thought
that
they
were
still
in
their
place
as
they
saw
them
disposed
in
the
day
then
while
the
commanders
were
engaged
in
strife
there
came
over
from
egina
aristeides
the
son
of
lysimachos
an
athenian
who
had
been
ostracised
by
the
people
a
man
whom
i
hold
according
to
that
which
i
hear
of
his
character
to
have
been
the
best
and
most
upright
of
all
athenians
this
man
came
into
the
council
and
called
forth
themistocles
who
was
to
him
not
a
friend
but
an
enemy
to
the
last
degree
but
because
of
the
greatness
of
the
present
troubles
he
let
those
matters
be
forgotten
and
called
him
forth
desiring
to
communicate
with
him
now
he
had
heard
beforehand
that
the
peloponnesians
were
pressing
to
take
the
ships
away
to
the
isthmus
so
when
themistocles
came
forth
to
him
aristeides
spoke
these
words
both
at
other
times
when
occasion
arises
and
also
especially
at
this
time
we
ought
to
carry
on
rivalry
as
to
which
of
us
shall
do
more
service
to
our
country
and
i
tell
thee
now
that
it
is
indifferent
whether
the
peloponnesians
say
many
words
or
few
about
sailing
away
from
hence
for
having
been
myself
an
i
tell
thee
that
now
not
even
if
the
corinthians
and
eurybiades
himself
desire
to
sail
out
will
they
be
able
for
we
are
encompassed
round
by
the
enemy
go
thou
in
then
and
signify
this
to
them
he
made
answer
as
follows
thou
advisest
very
well
and
also
the
news
which
thou
hast
brought
is
good
since
thou
art
come
having
witnessed
with
thine
own
eyes
that
which
i
desired
might
come
to
pass
for
know
that
this
which
is
being
done
by
the
medes
is
of
my
suggestion
because
when
the
hellenes
would
not
come
to
a
battle
of
their
own
will
it
was
necessary
to
bring
them
over
to
us
against
their
will
do
thou
however
since
thou
art
come
bearing
good
news
thyself
report
it
to
them
for
if
i
say
these
things
i
shall
be
thought
to
speak
that
which
i
have
myself
invented
and
i
shall
not
persuade
them
but
they
will
think
that
the
barbarians
are
not
doing
so
do
thou
thyself
however
come
forward
to
speak
and
declare
to
them
how
things
are
and
when
thou
hast
declared
this
if
they
are
persuaded
that
will
be
the
best
thing
but
if
this
is
not
credible
to
them
it
will
be
the
same
thing
so
far
as
concerns
us
for
they
will
no
longer
be
able
to
take
to
flight
if
we
are
encompassed
on
all
sides
as
thou
sayest
aristeides
accordingly
came
forward
and
told
them
this
saying
that
he
had
come
from
egina
and
had
with
difficulty
escaped
without
being
perceived
by
those
who
were
blockading
them
for
the
whole
encampment
of
the
hellenes
was
encompassed
by
the
ships
of
xerxes
and
he
counselled
them
to
get
ready
to
defend
themselves
he
then
having
thus
spoken
retired
and
among
them
again
there
arose
dispute
for
the
greater
number
of
the
commanders
did
not
believe
that
which
was
reported
to
them
and
while
these
were
doubting
there
came
a
trireme
manned
by
tenians
deserting
from
the
enemy
of
which
the
commander
was
panaitios
the
son
of
sosimenes
which
brought
them
the
whole
truth
for
this
deed
the
tenians
were
inscribed
at
delphi
on
the
tripod
among
those
who
had
conquered
the
barbarians
with
the
ship
which
deserted
at
salamis
and
the
lemnian
ship
which
deserted
before
and
came
to
artemision
the
naval
force
of
the
hellenes
was
completed
to
the
number
of
three
hundred
and
eighty
ships
for
before
this
two
ships
were
yet
wanting
to
make
up
this
number
the
hellenes
then
since
they
believed
that
which
was
said
by
the
tenians
were
preparing
for
a
and
as
the
dawn
appeared
they
made
an
assembly
of
those
who
fought
on
board
the
ships
and
addressed
them
themistocles
making
a
speech
which
was
eloquent
beyond
the
rest
and
the
substance
of
it
was
to
set
forth
all
that
is
better
as
opposed
to
that
which
is
worse
of
the
several
things
which
arise
in
the
nature
and
constitution
of
man
and
having
exhorted
them
to
choose
the
better
and
thus
having
wound
up
his
speech
he
bade
them
embark
in
their
ships
these
then
proceeded
to
embark
and
there
came
in
meanwhile
the
trireme
from
egina
which
had
gone
away
to
bring
the
sons
of
aiacos
then
the
hellenes
put
out
all
their
ships
and
while
they
were
putting
out
from
shore
the
barbarians
attacked
them
forthwith
now
the
other
hellenes
began
backing
their
ships
and
were
about
to
run
them
aground
but
ameinias
of
pallene
an
athenian
put
forth
with
his
ship
and
charged
one
of
the
enemy
and
his
ship
being
entangled
in
combat
and
the
men
not
being
able
to
get
away
the
others
joined
in
the
fight
to
assist
ameinias
the
athenians
say
that
the
beginning
of
the
battle
was
made
thus
but
the
eginetans
say
that
the
ship
which
went
away
to
egina
to
bring
the
sons
of
aiacos
was
that
which
began
the
fight
it
is
also
reported
that
an
apparition
of
a
woman
was
seen
by
them
and
that
having
appeared
she
encouraged
them
to
the
fight
so
that
the
whole
of
the
army
of
the
hellenes
heard
it
first
having
reproached
them
in
these
words
madmen
how
far
will
ye
yet
back
your
ships
opposite
the
athenians
had
been
ranged
the
phenicians
for
these
occupied
the
wing
towards
eleusis
and
the
west
and
opposite
the
lacedemonians
were
the
ionians
who
occupied
the
wing
which
extended
to
the
east
and
to
piræus
of
them
however
a
few
were
purposely
slack
in
the
fight
according
to
the
injunctions
of
themistocles
but
the
greater
number
were
not
so
i
might
mention
now
the
names
of
many
captains
of
ships
who
destroyed
ships
of
the
hellenes
but
i
will
make
no
use
of
their
names
except
in
the
case
of
theomestor
the
son
of
androdamas
and
phylacos
the
son
of
histiaios
of
samos
both
and
for
this
reason
i
make
mention
of
these
and
not
of
the
rest
because
theomestor
on
account
of
this
deed
became
despot
of
samos
appointed
by
the
persians
and
phylacos
was
recorded
as
a
benefactor
of
the
king
and
received
much
land
as
a
reward
now
the
benefactors
of
the
king
are
called
in
the
persian
tongue
orosangai
thus
it
was
with
these
but
the
greater
number
of
their
ships
were
disabled
at
salamis
being
destroyed
some
by
the
athenians
and
others
by
the
eginetans
for
since
the
hellenes
fought
in
order
and
ranged
in
their
places
while
the
barbarians
were
no
longer
ranged
in
order
nor
did
anything
with
design
it
was
likely
that
there
would
be
some
such
result
as
in
fact
followed
yet
on
this
day
they
surpassed
themselves
much
more
than
when
they
fought
by
euboea
every
one
being
eager
and
fearing
xerxes
and
each
man
thinking
that
the
king
was
looking
especially
at
him
as
regards
the
rest
i
can
not
speak
of
them
separately
or
say
precisely
how
the
barbarians
or
the
hellenes
individually
contended
in
the
fight
but
with
regard
to
artemisia
that
which
happened
was
this
whence
she
gained
yet
more
esteem
than
before
from
the
the
affairs
of
the
king
had
come
to
great
confusion
at
this
crisis
a
ship
of
artemisia
was
being
pursued
by
an
athenian
ship
and
as
she
was
not
able
to
escape
for
in
front
of
her
were
other
ships
of
her
own
side
while
her
ship
as
it
chanced
was
furthest
advanced
towards
the
enemy
she
resolved
what
she
would
do
and
it
proved
also
much
to
her
advantage
to
have
done
so
while
she
was
being
pursued
by
the
athenian
ship
she
charged
with
full
career
against
a
ship
of
her
own
side
manned
by
calyndians
and
in
which
the
king
of
the
calyndians
damasithymos
was
embarked
now
even
though
it
be
true
that
she
had
had
some
strife
with
him
before
while
they
were
still
about
the
hellespont
yet
i
am
not
able
to
say
whether
she
did
this
by
intention
or
whether
the
calyndian
ship
happened
by
chance
to
fall
in
her
way
having
charged
against
it
however
and
sunk
it
she
enjoyed
good
fortune
and
got
for
herself
good
in
two
ways
for
first
the
captain
of
the
athenian
ship
when
he
saw
her
charge
against
a
ship
manned
by
barbarians
turned
away
and
went
after
others
supposing
that
the
ship
of
artemisia
was
either
a
hellenic
ship
or
was
deserting
from
the
barbarians
and
fighting
for
the
hellenes
i
say
it
was
her
fortune
to
have
this
namely
to
escape
and
not
suffer
destruction
and
then
secondly
it
happened
that
though
she
had
done
mischief
she
yet
gained
great
reputation
by
this
thing
with
xerxes
for
it
is
said
that
the
king
looking
on
at
the
fight
perceived
that
her
ship
had
charged
the
other
and
one
of
those
present
said
master
dost
thou
see
artemisia
how
well
she
is
fighting
and
how
she
sank
even
now
a
ship
of
the
enemy
he
asked
whether
this
was
in
truth
the
deed
of
artemisia
and
they
said
that
it
was
for
they
declared
they
knew
very
well
the
sign
of
her
ship
and
that
which
was
destroyed
they
thought
surely
was
one
of
the
enemy
for
besides
other
things
which
happened
fortunately
for
her
as
i
have
said
there
was
this
also
namely
that
not
one
of
the
crew
of
the
calyndian
ship
survived
to
become
her
accuser
and
xerxes
in
answer
to
that
which
was
said
to
him
is
reported
to
have
uttered
these
words
my
men
have
become
women
and
my
women
men
thus
it
is
said
that
xerxes
spoke
and
meanwhile
in
this
struggle
there
was
slain
the
commander
ariabignes
son
of
dareios
and
brother
of
xerxes
and
there
were
slain
too
many
others
of
note
of
the
persians
and
medes
and
also
of
the
allies
and
of
the
hellenes
on
their
part
a
few
for
since
they
knew
how
to
swim
those
whose
ships
were
destroyed
and
who
were
not
slain
in
conflict
swam
over
to
salamis
but
of
the
barbarians
the
greater
number
perished
in
the
sea
not
being
able
to
swim
and
when
the
first
ships
turned
to
flight
then
it
was
that
the
largest
number
perished
for
those
who
were
stationed
behind
while
endeavouring
to
pass
with
their
ships
to
the
front
in
order
that
they
also
might
display
some
deed
of
valour
for
the
king
to
see
ran
into
the
ships
of
their
own
side
as
they
fled
it
happened
also
in
the
course
of
this
confusion
that
some
of
the
phenicians
whose
ships
had
been
destroyed
came
to
the
king
and
accused
the
ionians
saying
that
by
means
of
them
their
ships
had
been
lost
and
that
they
had
been
traitors
to
the
cause
now
it
so
came
about
that
not
only
the
commanders
of
the
ionians
did
not
lose
their
lives
but
the
phenicians
who
accused
them
received
a
reward
such
as
i
shall
tell
while
these
men
were
yet
speaking
thus
a
samothrakian
ship
charged
against
an
athenian
ship
and
as
the
athenian
ship
was
being
sunk
by
it
an
eginetan
ship
came
up
against
the
samothrakian
vessel
and
ran
it
down
then
the
samothrakians
being
skilful
by
hurling
cleared
off
the
from
the
ship
which
had
wrecked
theirs
and
then
embarked
upon
it
and
took
possession
of
it
this
event
saved
the
ionians
from
punishment
for
when
xerxes
saw
that
they
had
performed
a
great
exploit
he
turned
to
the
phenicians
for
he
was
exceedingly
vexed
and
disposed
to
find
fault
with
all
and
bade
cut
off
their
heads
in
order
that
they
might
not
after
having
been
cowards
themselves
accuse
others
who
were
better
men
than
they
for
whensoever
xerxes
sitting
just
under
the
mountain
opposite
salamis
which
is
called
aigaleos
saw
any
one
of
his
own
side
display
a
deed
of
valour
in
the
he
inquired
about
him
who
had
done
it
and
the
scribes
recorded
the
name
of
the
ship
captain
with
that
of
his
father
and
the
city
from
whence
he
came
moreover
also
ariaramnes
a
persian
who
was
present
shared
the
fate
of
the
phenicians
being
their
friend
they
then
proceeded
to
deal
with
the
phenicians
in
the
meantime
as
the
barbarians
turned
to
flight
and
were
sailing
out
towards
phaleron
the
eginetans
waited
for
them
in
the
passage
and
displayed
memorable
actions
for
while
the
athenians
in
the
confused
tumult
were
disabling
both
those
ships
which
resisted
and
those
which
were
fleeing
the
eginetans
were
destroying
those
which
attempted
to
sail
away
and
whenever
any
escaped
the
athenians
they
went
in
full
course
and
fell
among
the
eginetans
then
there
met
one
another
the
ship
of
themistocles
which
was
pursuing
a
ship
of
the
enemy
and
that
of
polycritos
the
son
of
crios
the
eginetan
this
last
had
charged
against
a
ship
of
sidon
the
same
that
had
taken
the
eginetan
vessel
which
was
keeping
watch
in
advance
at
skiathos
and
in
which
sailed
pytheas
the
son
of
ischenoös
whom
the
persians
kept
in
their
ship
all
cut
to
pieces
as
he
was
making
a
marvel
of
his
valour
the
sidonian
ship
then
was
captured
bearing
with
it
this
man
as
well
as
the
persians
of
whom
i
spoke
so
that
pytheas
thus
came
safe
to
egina
now
when
polycritos
looked
at
the
athenian
vessel
he
recognised
when
he
saw
it
the
sign
of
the
admiral
ship
and
shouting
out
he
addressed
themistocles
with
mockery
about
the
accusation
brought
against
the
eginetans
of
taking
the
side
of
the
medes
and
reproached
him
this
taunt
polycritos
threw
out
against
themistocles
after
he
had
charged
against
the
ship
of
sidon
and
meanwhile
those
barbarians
whose
ships
had
escaped
destruction
fled
and
came
to
phaleron
to
be
under
cover
of
the
in
this
the
eginetans
were
of
all
the
hellenes
the
best
reported
of
and
next
to
them
the
athenians
and
of
the
individual
men
the
eginetan
polycritos
and
the
athenians
eumenes
of
anagyrus
and
ameinias
of
pallene
the
man
who
had
pursued
after
artemisia
now
if
he
had
known
that
artemisia
was
sailing
in
this
ship
he
would
not
have
ceased
until
either
he
had
taken
her
or
had
been
taken
himself
for
orders
had
been
given
to
the
athenian
captains
and
moreover
a
prize
was
offered
of
ten
thousand
drachmas
for
the
man
who
should
take
her
alive
since
they
thought
it
intolerable
that
a
woman
should
make
an
expedition
against
athens
she
then
as
has
been
said
before
had
made
her
escape
and
the
others
also
whose
ships
had
escaped
destruction
were
at
phaleron
as
regards
adeimantos
the
commander
of
the
corinthians
the
athenians
say
that
forthwith
at
the
beginning
when
the
ships
were
engaging
in
the
fight
being
struck
with
panic
and
terror
he
put
up
his
sails
and
fled
away
and
the
corinthians
when
they
saw
the
ship
fleeing
departed
likewise
and
after
this
as
the
story
goes
when
they
came
in
their
flight
opposite
to
the
temple
of
athene
skiras
in
the
land
of
salamis
there
fell
in
with
them
by
divine
guidance
a
light
vessel
which
no
one
was
ever
found
to
have
sent
and
which
approached
the
corinthians
at
a
time
when
they
knew
nothing
of
that
which
was
happening
with
the
fleet
and
by
this
it
is
conjectured
that
the
matter
was
of
the
deity
for
when
they
came
near
to
the
ships
the
men
in
the
light
vessel
said
these
words
adeimantos
thou
hast
turned
thy
ships
away
and
hast
set
forth
to
flee
deserting
the
cause
of
the
hellenes
while
they
are
in
truth
gaining
a
victory
and
getting
the
better
of
their
foes
as
much
as
they
desired
when
they
said
this
since
adeimantos
doubted
of
it
they
spoke
a
second
time
and
said
that
they
might
be
taken
as
hostages
and
slain
if
the
hellenes
should
prove
not
to
be
gaining
the
victory
then
he
turned
his
ship
back
he
and
the
others
with
him
and
they
reached
the
camp
when
the
work
was
finished
such
is
the
report
spread
by
the
athenians
against
these
the
corinthians
however
do
not
allow
this
to
be
so
but
hold
that
they
were
among
the
first
in
the
and
the
rest
of
hellas
also
bears
witness
on
their
side
aristeides
moreover
the
son
of
lysimachos
the
athenian
of
whom
i
made
mention
also
shortly
before
this
as
a
very
good
man
he
in
this
tumult
which
had
arisen
about
salamis
did
as
follows
with
him
a
number
of
the
hoplites
of
athenian
race
who
had
been
ranged
along
the
shore
of
the
land
of
salamis
with
them
he
disembarked
on
the
island
of
psyttaleia
and
these
slew
all
the
persians
who
were
in
this
islet
when
the
had
been
broken
off
the
hellenes
towed
in
to
salamis
so
many
of
the
wrecks
as
chanced
to
be
still
about
there
and
held
themselves
ready
for
another
expecting
that
the
king
would
yet
make
use
of
the
ships
which
remained
unhurt
but
many
of
the
wrecks
were
taken
by
the
west
wind
and
borne
to
that
strand
in
attica
which
is
called
colias
so
as
to
fulfil
not
only
all
that
other
oracle
which
was
spoken
about
this
by
bakis
and
musaios
but
also
especially
with
reference
to
the
wrecks
cast
up
here
that
which
had
been
spoken
in
an
oracle
many
years
before
these
events
by
lysistratos
an
athenian
who
uttered
oracles
and
which
had
not
been
observed
by
any
of
the
hellenes
then
shall
the
colian
women
with
firewood
of
oars
roast
barley
this
was
destined
to
come
to
pass
after
the
king
had
marched
away
when
xerxes
perceived
the
disaster
which
had
come
upon
him
he
feared
lest
some
one
of
the
ionians
should
suggest
to
the
hellenes
or
they
should
themselves
form
the
idea
to
sail
to
the
hellespont
and
break
up
the
bridges
and
so
he
might
be
cut
off
in
europe
and
run
the
risk
of
perishing
utterly
therefore
he
began
to
consider
about
taking
flight
he
desired
however
that
his
intention
should
not
be
perceived
either
by
the
hellenes
or
by
those
of
his
own
side
therefore
he
attempted
to
construct
a
mole
going
across
to
salamis
and
he
bound
together
phenician
merchant
vessels
in
order
that
they
might
serve
him
both
for
a
bridge
and
a
wall
and
made
preparations
for
fighting
as
if
he
were
going
to
have
another
battle
by
sea
seeing
him
do
so
all
the
rest
made
sure
that
he
had
got
himself
ready
in
earnest
and
intended
to
stay
and
fight
but
mardonios
did
not
fail
to
perceive
the
true
meaning
of
all
these
things
being
by
experience
very
well
versed
in
his
way
of
thinking
while
xerxes
was
doing
thus
he
sent
a
messenger
to
the
persians
to
announce
the
calamity
which
had
come
upon
them
now
there
is
nothing
mortal
which
accomplishes
a
journey
with
more
speed
than
these
messengers
so
skilfully
has
this
been
invented
by
the
persians
for
they
say
that
according
to
the
number
of
days
of
which
the
entire
journey
consists
so
many
horses
and
men
are
set
at
intervals
each
man
and
horse
appointed
for
a
day
journey
these
neither
snow
nor
rain
nor
heat
nor
darkness
of
night
prevents
from
accomplishing
each
one
the
task
proposed
to
him
with
the
very
utmost
speed
the
first
then
rides
and
delivers
the
message
with
which
he
is
charged
to
the
second
and
the
second
to
the
third
and
after
that
it
goes
through
them
handed
from
one
to
the
other
as
in
the
among
the
hellenes
which
they
perform
for
hephaistos
this
kind
of
running
of
their
horses
the
persians
call
angareion
the
first
message
then
which
came
to
susa
announcing
that
xerxes
had
athens
in
his
possession
so
greatly
rejoiced
the
persians
who
had
been
left
behind
that
they
strewed
all
the
ways
with
myrtle
boughs
and
offered
incense
perpetually
and
themselves
continued
in
sacrifices
and
feasting
the
second
message
however
which
came
to
them
after
this
so
greatly
disturbed
them
that
they
all
tore
their
garments
and
gave
themselves
up
to
crying
and
lamentation
without
stint
laying
the
blame
upon
mardonios
and
this
the
persians
did
not
so
much
because
they
were
grieved
about
the
ships
as
because
they
feared
for
xerxes
himself
as
regards
the
persians
this
went
on
for
all
the
time
which
intervened
until
the
coming
of
xerxes
himself
caused
them
to
cease
and
mardonios
seeing
that
xerxes
was
greatly
troubled
by
reason
of
the
and
suspecting
that
he
was
meaning
to
take
flight
from
athens
considered
with
regard
to
himself
that
he
would
have
to
suffer
punishment
for
having
persuaded
the
king
to
make
an
expedition
against
hellas
and
that
it
was
better
for
him
to
run
the
risk
of
either
subduing
hellas
or
ending
his
own
life
honourably
placing
his
safety
in
suspense
for
a
great
end
though
his
opinion
was
rather
that
he
would
subdue
hellas
reckoned
up
these
things
i
say
and
addressed
his
speech
to
the
king
as
follows
master
be
not
thou
grieved
nor
feel
great
trouble
on
account
of
this
thing
which
has
come
to
pass
for
it
is
not
upon
a
contest
of
timbers
that
all
our
fortunes
depend
but
of
men
and
of
horses
and
none
of
these
who
suppose
now
that
all
has
been
achieved
by
them
will
attempt
to
disembark
from
the
ships
and
stand
against
thee
nor
will
any
in
this
mainland
do
so
but
those
who
did
stand
against
us
paid
the
penalty
if
therefore
thou
thinkest
this
good
to
do
let
us
forthwith
attempt
the
peloponnese
or
if
thou
thinkest
good
to
hold
back
we
may
do
that
do
not
despond
however
for
there
is
no
way
of
escape
for
the
hellenes
to
avoid
being
thy
slaves
after
they
have
first
given
an
account
of
that
which
they
did
to
thee
both
now
and
at
former
times
thus
it
were
best
to
do
but
if
thou
hast
indeed
resolved
to
retire
thyself
and
to
withdraw
thy
army
i
have
another
counsel
to
offer
for
that
case
too
do
not
thou
o
king
let
the
persians
be
an
object
of
laughter
to
the
hellenes
for
none
of
thy
affairs
have
suffered
by
means
of
the
persians
nor
wilt
thou
be
able
to
mention
any
place
where
we
proved
ourselves
cowards
but
if
phenicians
or
egyptians
or
cyprians
or
kilikians
proved
themselves
cowards
the
calamity
which
followed
does
not
belong
to
the
persians
in
any
way
now
therefore
since
it
is
not
the
persians
who
are
guilty
towards
thee
follow
my
counsel
if
thou
hast
determined
not
to
remain
here
retire
thou
to
thine
own
abode
taking
with
thee
the
main
body
of
the
army
and
it
must
then
be
for
me
to
deliver
over
to
thee
hellas
reduced
to
subjection
choosing
for
this
purpose
thirty
myriads
from
the
army
hearing
this
xerxes
was
rejoiced
and
delighted
so
far
as
he
might
be
after
his
misfortunes
and
to
mardonios
he
said
that
when
he
had
taken
counsel
he
would
reply
and
say
which
of
these
two
things
he
would
do
so
when
he
was
taking
counsel
with
those
of
the
persians
who
were
called
to
be
his
advisers
it
seemed
good
to
him
to
send
for
artemisia
also
to
give
him
counsel
because
at
the
former
time
she
alone
had
showed
herself
to
have
perception
of
that
which
ought
to
be
done
so
when
artemisia
had
come
xerxes
removed
from
him
all
the
rest
both
the
persian
councillors
and
also
the
spearmen
of
the
guard
and
spoke
to
her
thus
mardonios
bids
me
stay
here
and
make
an
attempt
on
the
peloponnese
saying
that
the
persians
and
the
are
not
guilty
of
any
share
in
my
calamity
and
that
they
would
gladly
give
me
proof
of
this
he
bids
me
therefore
either
do
this
or
if
not
he
desires
himself
to
choose
thirty
myriads
from
the
army
and
to
deliver
over
to
me
hellas
reduced
to
subjection
and
he
bids
me
withdraw
with
the
rest
of
the
army
to
my
own
abode
do
thou
therefore
as
thou
didst
well
advise
about
the
which
was
fought
urging
that
we
should
not
bring
it
on
so
also
now
advise
me
which
of
these
things
i
shall
do
that
i
may
succeed
in
determining
well
he
thus
consulted
her
and
she
spoke
these
words
o
king
it
is
hard
for
me
to
succeed
in
saying
the
best
things
when
one
asks
me
for
counsel
yet
it
seems
good
to
me
at
the
present
that
thou
shouldest
retire
back
and
leave
mardonios
here
if
he
desires
it
and
undertakes
to
do
this
together
with
those
whom
he
desires
to
have
for
on
the
one
hand
if
he
subdue
those
whom
he
says
that
he
desires
to
subdue
and
if
those
matters
succeed
well
which
he
has
in
mind
when
he
thus
speaks
the
deed
will
after
all
be
thine
master
seeing
that
thy
slaves
achieved
it
and
on
the
other
hand
if
the
opposite
shall
come
to
pass
of
that
which
mardonios
intends
it
will
be
no
great
misfortune
seeing
that
thou
wilt
thyself
remain
safe
and
also
the
power
in
those
parts
which
concerns
thy
house
for
if
thou
shalt
remain
safe
with
thy
house
many
contests
many
times
over
repeated
will
the
hellenes
have
to
pass
through
for
their
own
existence
of
mardonios
however
if
he
suffer
any
disaster
no
account
will
be
made
and
if
the
hellenes
conquer
they
gain
a
victory
which
is
no
victory
having
destroyed
one
who
is
but
thy
slave
thou
however
wilt
retire
having
done
that
for
which
thou
didst
make
thy
march
that
is
to
say
having
delivered
athens
to
the
fire
with
this
advice
xerxes
was
greatly
delighted
since
she
succeeded
in
saying
that
very
thing
which
he
himself
was
meaning
to
do
for
not
even
if
all
the
men
and
all
the
women
in
the
world
had
been
counselling
him
to
remain
would
he
have
done
so
as
i
think
so
much
had
he
been
struck
with
terror
he
commended
artemisia
therefore
and
sent
her
away
to
conduct
his
sons
to
ephesos
for
there
were
certain
bastard
sons
of
his
which
accompanied
him
with
these
sons
he
sent
hermotimos
to
have
charge
of
them
who
was
by
race
of
pedasa
and
was
in
the
estimation
of
the
king
second
to
none
of
the
eunuchs
now
the
pedasians
dwell
above
halicarnassos
and
at
this
pedasa
a
thing
happens
as
follows
to
the
whole
number
of
those
who
dwell
about
this
city
some
trouble
is
about
to
come
within
a
certain
time
then
the
priestess
of
athene
in
that
place
gets
a
long
beard
and
this
has
happened
to
them
twice
before
now
of
these
pedasians
was
hermotimos
and
this
man
of
all
persons
whom
we
know
up
to
this
time
obtained
the
greatest
revenge
for
a
wrong
done
to
him
for
he
had
been
captured
by
enemies
and
was
being
sold
and
panionios
a
man
of
chios
bought
him
one
who
had
set
himself
to
gain
his
livelihood
by
the
most
impious
practices
for
whenever
he
obtained
boys
who
possessed
some
beauty
he
would
make
eunuchs
of
them
and
then
taking
them
to
sardis
or
ephesos
sold
them
for
large
sums
of
money
since
with
the
barbarians
eunuchs
are
held
to
be
of
more
value
for
all
matters
of
trust
than
those
who
are
not
eunuchs
panionios
then
i
say
made
eunuchs
of
many
others
since
by
this
he
got
his
livelihood
and
also
of
this
man
about
whom
i
speak
and
hermotimos
being
not
in
everything
unfortunate
was
sent
from
sardis
to
the
king
with
other
gifts
and
as
time
went
on
he
came
to
be
honoured
more
than
all
the
other
eunuchs
in
the
sight
of
xerxes
and
when
the
king
being
at
that
time
in
sardis
was
setting
the
persian
army
in
motion
to
march
against
athens
then
hermotimos
having
gone
down
for
some
business
to
that
part
of
mysia
which
the
chians
occupy
and
which
is
called
atarneus
found
there
panionios
and
having
recognised
him
he
spoke
to
him
many
friendly
words
first
recounting
to
him
all
the
good
things
which
he
had
by
his
means
and
next
making
promises
in
return
for
this
and
saying
how
many
good
things
he
would
do
for
him
if
he
would
bring
his
household
and
dwell
in
that
land
so
that
panionios
gladly
accepting
his
proposals
brought
his
children
and
his
wife
then
when
he
had
caught
him
together
with
his
whole
house
hermotimos
spoke
as
follows
o
thou
who
of
all
men
that
ever
lived
up
to
this
time
didst
gain
thy
substance
by
the
most
impious
deeds
what
evil
did
either
i
myself
or
any
of
my
forefathers
do
either
to
thee
or
to
any
of
thine
that
thou
didst
make
me
to
be
that
which
is
nought
instead
of
a
man
didst
thou
suppose
that
thou
wouldest
escape
the
notice
of
the
gods
for
such
things
as
then
thou
didst
devise
they
however
following
the
rule
of
justice
delivered
thee
into
my
hands
since
thou
hadst
done
impious
deeds
so
that
thou
shalt
not
have
reason
to
find
fault
with
the
penalty
which
shall
be
inflicted
upon
thee
by
me
when
he
had
thus
reproached
him
the
man
sons
were
brought
into
his
presence
and
panionios
was
compelled
to
make
eunuchs
of
his
own
sons
who
were
four
in
number
and
being
compelled
he
did
so
and
then
when
he
had
so
done
the
sons
were
compelled
to
do
the
same
thing
to
him
thus
vengeance
by
the
hands
of
hermotimos
overtook
panionios
when
xerxes
had
entrusted
his
sons
to
artemisia
to
carry
them
back
to
ephesos
he
called
mardonios
and
bade
him
choose
of
the
army
whom
he
would
and
make
his
deeds
if
possible
correspond
to
his
words
during
this
day
then
things
went
so
far
and
in
the
night
on
the
command
of
the
king
the
leaders
of
the
fleet
began
to
withdraw
their
ships
from
phaleron
to
the
hellespont
as
quickly
as
they
might
each
one
to
guard
the
bridges
for
the
king
to
pass
over
and
when
the
barbarians
were
near
zoster
as
they
sailed
then
seeing
the
small
points
of
rock
which
stretch
out
to
sea
from
this
part
of
the
mainland
they
thought
that
these
were
ships
and
fled
for
a
good
distance
in
time
however
perceiving
that
they
were
not
ships
but
points
of
rock
they
assembled
together
again
and
continued
on
their
voyage
when
day
dawned
the
hellenes
seeing
that
the
was
staying
still
in
its
place
supposed
that
the
ships
also
were
about
phaleron
and
thinking
that
they
would
fight
another
they
made
preparations
to
repel
them
when
however
they
were
informed
that
the
ships
had
departed
forthwith
upon
this
they
thought
it
good
to
pursue
after
them
they
pursued
therefore
as
far
as
andros
but
did
not
get
a
sight
of
the
fleet
of
xerxes
and
when
they
had
come
to
andros
they
deliberated
what
they
should
do
themistocles
then
declared
as
his
opinion
that
they
should
take
their
course
through
the
islands
and
pursue
after
the
ships
and
afterwards
sail
straight
to
the
hellespont
to
break
up
the
bridges
but
eurybiades
expressed
the
opposite
opinion
to
this
saying
that
if
they
should
break
up
the
they
would
therein
do
the
greatest
possible
evil
to
hellas
for
if
the
persian
should
be
cut
off
and
compelled
to
remain
in
europe
he
would
endeavour
not
to
remain
still
since
if
he
remained
still
neither
could
any
of
his
affairs
go
forward
nor
would
any
way
of
returning
home
appear
but
his
army
would
perish
of
hunger
whereas
if
he
made
the
attempt
and
persevered
in
it
all
europe
might
be
brought
over
to
him
city
by
city
and
nation
by
nation
the
inhabitants
being
either
conquered
or
surrendering
on
terms
before
they
were
conquered
moreover
they
would
have
for
food
the
crops
of
the
hellenes
which
grew
year
by
year
he
thought
however
that
conquered
in
the
the
persian
would
not
stay
in
europe
and
therefore
he
might
be
allowed
to
flee
until
in
his
flight
he
came
to
his
own
land
then
after
that
they
might
begin
the
contest
for
the
land
which
belonged
to
the
persian
to
this
opinion
the
commanders
of
the
other
peloponnesians
adhered
also
when
themistocles
perceived
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
persuade
them
or
at
least
the
greater
number
of
them
to
sail
to
the
hellespont
he
changed
his
counsel
and
turning
to
the
athenians
for
these
were
grieved
most
at
the
escape
of
the
enemy
and
were
anxious
to
sail
to
the
hellespont
even
by
themselves
alone
if
the
others
were
not
willing
to
them
he
spoke
as
follows
i
myself
also
have
been
present
before
now
on
many
occasions
and
have
heard
of
many
more
on
which
something
of
this
kind
came
to
pass
namely
that
men
who
were
forced
into
great
straits
after
they
had
been
defeated
fought
again
and
repaired
their
former
disaster
and
as
for
us
since
we
have
won
as
a
prize
from
fortune
the
existence
of
ourselves
and
of
hellas
by
repelling
from
our
land
so
great
a
cloud
of
men
let
us
not
pursue
enemies
who
flee
from
us
for
of
these
things
not
we
were
the
doors
but
the
gods
and
heroes
who
grudged
that
one
man
should
become
king
of
both
asia
and
of
europe
and
he
a
man
unholy
and
presumptuous
one
who
made
no
difference
between
things
sacred
and
things
profane
burning
and
casting
down
the
images
of
the
gods
and
who
also
scourged
the
sea
and
let
down
into
it
fetters
but
as
things
are
at
present
it
is
well
that
we
should
now
remain
in
hellas
and
look
after
ourselves
and
our
households
and
let
each
man
repair
his
house
and
have
a
care
for
sowing
his
land
after
he
has
completely
driven
away
the
barbarian
and
then
at
the
beginning
of
the
spring
let
us
sail
down
towards
the
hellespont
and
ionia
thus
he
spoke
intending
to
lay
up
for
himself
a
store
of
gratitude
with
the
persian
in
order
that
if
after
all
any
evil
should
come
upon
him
at
the
hands
of
the
athenians
he
might
have
a
place
of
refuge
and
this
was
in
fact
that
which
came
to
pass
themistocles
then
speaking
thus
endeavoured
to
deceive
them
and
the
athenians
followed
his
advice
for
he
had
had
the
reputation
even
in
former
times
of
being
a
man
of
ability
and
he
had
now
proved
himself
to
be
in
truth
both
able
and
of
good
judgment
therefore
they
were
ready
in
every
way
to
follow
his
advice
when
he
spoke
so
when
these
had
been
persuaded
by
him
forthwith
after
this
themistocles
sent
men
with
a
vessel
whom
he
trusted
to
keep
silence
to
whatever
test
they
might
be
brought
of
that
which
he
himself
charged
them
to
tell
the
king
and
of
them
sikinnos
his
servant
again
was
one
when
these
came
to
attica
the
rest
stayed
behind
in
the
ship
while
sikinnos
went
up
to
xerxes
and
spoke
these
words
themistocles
the
son
of
neocles
sent
me
who
is
commander
of
the
athenians
and
of
all
the
allies
the
best
and
ablest
man
to
tell
thee
that
themistocles
the
athenian
desiring
to
be
of
service
to
thee
held
back
the
hellenes
when
they
were
desirous
to
pursue
after
thy
ships
and
to
destroy
the
bridges
on
the
hellespont
now
therefore
thou
mayest
make
thy
way
home
quite
undisturbed
they
having
signified
this
sailed
away
again
the
hellenes
meanwhile
having
resolved
not
to
pursue
after
the
ships
of
the
barbarians
further
nor
to
sail
to
the
hellespont
to
break
up
the
passage
were
investing
andros
intending
to
take
it
for
the
andrians
were
the
first
of
the
islanders
who
being
asked
by
themistocles
for
money
refused
to
give
it
and
when
themistocles
made
proposals
to
them
and
said
that
the
athenians
had
come
having
on
their
side
two
great
deities
persuasion
and
compulsion
and
therefore
they
must
by
all
means
give
them
money
they
replied
to
this
that
not
without
reason
as
it
now
appeared
was
athens
great
and
prosperous
since
the
athenians
were
well
supplied
with
serviceable
deities
but
as
for
the
andrians
they
were
poor
having
in
this
respect
attained
to
the
greatest
eminence
and
there
were
two
unprofitable
deities
which
never
left
their
island
but
always
remained
attached
to
the
place
poverty
namely
and
helplessness
and
the
andrians
being
possessed
of
these
deities
would
not
give
money
for
never
could
the
power
of
the
athenians
get
the
better
of
their
inability
these
i
say
having
thus
made
answer
and
having
refused
to
give
the
money
were
being
besieged
and
themistocles
not
ceasing
in
his
desire
for
gain
sent
threatening
messages
to
the
other
islands
and
asked
them
for
money
by
the
same
envoys
employing
those
whom
he
had
before
sent
to
the
king
and
he
said
that
if
they
did
not
give
that
which
was
demanded
of
them
he
would
bring
the
fleet
of
the
hellenes
against
them
to
besiege
and
take
them
thus
saying
he
collected
great
sums
of
money
from
the
carystians
and
the
parians
who
being
informed
how
andros
was
being
besieged
because
it
had
taken
the
side
of
the
medes
and
how
themistocles
was
held
in
more
regard
than
any
of
the
other
commanders
sent
money
for
fear
of
this
whether
any
others
of
the
islanders
also
gave
money
i
am
not
able
to
say
but
i
think
that
some
others
gave
and
not
these
alone
yet
to
the
carystians
at
least
there
was
no
respite
from
the
evil
on
this
account
but
the
parians
escaped
the
attack
because
they
propitiated
themistocles
with
money
thus
themistocles
with
andros
as
his
was
acquiring
sums
of
money
for
himself
from
the
men
of
the
islands
without
the
knowledge
of
the
other
commanders
xerxes
meanwhile
with
his
army
stayed
for
a
few
days
after
the
and
then
they
all
began
to
march
forth
towards
boeotia
by
the
same
way
by
which
they
had
come
for
mardonios
thought
both
that
it
was
well
for
him
to
escort
the
king
on
his
way
and
also
that
it
was
now
too
late
in
the
year
to
carry
on
the
war
it
was
better
he
thought
to
winter
in
thessaly
and
then
at
the
beginning
of
spring
to
attempt
the
peloponnese
when
he
came
to
thessaly
then
mardonios
chose
out
for
himself
first
all
those
persians
who
are
called
immortals
except
only
their
commander
hydarnes
for
hydarnes
said
that
he
would
not
be
left
behind
by
the
king
and
after
them
of
the
other
persians
those
who
wore
cuirasses
and
the
body
of
a
thousand
horse
also
the
medes
sacans
bactrians
and
indians
foot
and
horsemen
both
these
nations
he
chose
in
the
mass
but
from
the
other
allies
he
selected
by
few
at
a
time
choosing
whose
who
had
fine
appearance
of
those
of
whom
he
knew
that
they
had
done
good
service
from
the
persians
he
chose
more
than
from
any
other
single
nation
and
these
wore
collars
of
twisted
metal
and
bracelets
and
after
them
came
the
medes
who
in
fact
were
not
inferior
in
number
to
the
persians
but
only
in
bodily
strength
the
result
was
that
there
were
thirty
myriads
in
all
including
cavalry
during
this
time
while
mardonios
was
selecting
his
army
and
xerxes
was
in
thessaly
there
had
come
an
oracle
from
delphi
to
the
lacedemonians
bidding
them
ask
satisfaction
from
xerxes
for
the
murder
of
leonidas
and
accept
that
which
should
be
given
by
him
the
spartans
therefore
sent
a
herald
as
quickly
as
possible
who
having
found
the
whole
army
still
in
thessaly
came
into
the
presence
of
xerxes
and
spoke
these
words
o
king
of
the
medes
the
lacedemonians
and
the
sons
of
heracles
of
sparta
demand
of
thee
satisfaction
for
murder
because
thou
didst
kill
their
king
fighting
in
defence
of
hellas
he
laughed
and
then
kept
silence
some
time
and
after
that
pointing
to
mardonios
who
happened
to
be
standing
by
him
he
said
then
mardonios
here
shall
give
them
satisfaction
such
as
is
fitting
for
them
to
have
the
herald
accordingly
accepted
the
utterance
and
departed
and
xerxes
leaving
mardonios
in
thessaly
went
on
himself
in
haste
to
the
hellespont
and
arrived
at
the
passage
where
the
crossing
was
in
days
bringing
back
next
to
nothing
as
one
may
say
of
his
army
and
whithersoever
they
came
on
the
march
and
to
whatever
nation
they
seized
the
crops
of
that
people
and
used
them
for
provisions
and
if
they
found
no
crops
then
they
took
the
grass
which
was
growing
up
from
the
earth
and
stripped
off
the
bark
from
the
trees
and
plucked
down
the
leaves
and
devoured
them
alike
of
the
cultivated
trees
and
of
those
growing
wild
and
they
left
nothing
behind
them
thus
they
did
by
reason
of
famine
then
plague
too
seized
upon
the
army
and
dysentery
which
destroyed
them
by
the
way
and
some
of
them
also
who
were
sick
the
king
left
behind
laying
charge
upon
the
cities
where
at
the
time
he
chanced
to
be
in
his
march
to
take
care
of
them
and
support
them
of
these
he
left
some
in
thessaly
and
some
at
siris
in
paionia
and
some
in
macedonia
in
these
parts
too
he
had
left
behind
him
the
sacred
chariot
of
zeus
when
he
was
marching
against
hellas
but
on
his
return
he
did
not
receive
it
back
for
the
paionians
had
given
it
to
the
thracians
and
when
xerxes
asked
for
it
again
they
said
that
the
mares
while
at
pasture
had
been
carried
off
by
the
thracians
of
the
upper
country
who
dwelt
about
the
source
of
the
strymon
here
also
a
thracian
the
king
of
the
bisaltians
and
of
the
crestonian
land
did
a
deed
of
surpassing
horror
for
he
had
said
that
he
would
not
himself
be
subject
to
xerxes
with
his
own
will
and
had
gone
away
up
to
mount
rhodope
and
also
he
had
forbidden
his
sons
to
go
on
the
march
against
hellas
they
however
either
because
they
cared
not
for
his
command
or
else
because
a
desire
came
upon
them
to
see
the
war
went
on
the
march
with
the
persian
and
when
they
returned
all
unhurt
being
six
in
number
their
father
plucked
out
their
eyes
for
this
cause
they
then
received
this
reward
and
as
to
the
persians
when
passing
on
from
thrace
they
came
to
the
passage
they
crossed
over
the
hellespont
in
haste
to
abydos
by
means
of
the
ships
for
they
did
not
find
the
still
stretched
across
but
broken
up
by
a
storm
while
staying
there
for
a
time
they
had
distributed
to
them
an
allowance
of
food
more
abundant
than
they
had
had
by
the
way
and
from
satisfying
their
hunger
without
restraint
and
also
from
the
changes
of
water
there
died
many
of
those
in
the
army
who
had
remained
safe
till
then
the
rest
arrived
with
xerxes
at
sardis
there
is
also
another
story
reported
as
follows
namely
that
when
xerxes
on
his
march
away
from
athens
came
to
eïon
on
the
strymon
from
that
point
he
did
not
continue
further
to
make
marches
by
road
but
delivered
his
army
to
hydarnes
to
lead
back
to
the
hellespont
while
he
himself
embarked
in
a
phenician
ship
and
set
forth
for
asia
and
as
he
sailed
he
was
seized
by
a
wind
from
the
strymon
violent
and
raising
great
waves
and
since
he
was
tossed
by
the
storm
more
and
more
the
ship
being
heavily
laden
for
there
were
upon
the
deck
great
numbers
of
persians
those
namely
who
went
with
xerxes
the
king
upon
that
falling
into
fear
shouted
aloud
and
asked
the
pilot
whether
there
were
for
them
any
means
of
safety
he
said
master
there
are
none
unless
some
way
be
found
of
freeing
ourselves
of
the
excessive
number
of
passengers
then
it
is
said
that
xerxes
when
he
heard
this
spoke
thus
persians
now
let
each
one
of
you
show
that
he
has
care
for
the
king
for
my
safety
as
it
seems
depends
upon
you
he
they
say
thus
spoke
and
they
made
obeisance
to
him
and
leapt
out
into
the
sea
and
so
the
ship
being
lightened
came
safe
to
asia
as
soon
as
they
had
landed
xerxes
they
say
first
presented
the
pilot
with
a
wreath
of
gold
because
he
had
saved
the
life
of
the
king
and
then
cut
off
his
head
because
he
had
caused
the
death
of
many
of
the
persians
this
other
story
i
say
is
reported
about
the
return
of
xerxes
but
i
for
my
part
can
by
no
means
believe
it
either
in
other
respects
or
as
regards
this
which
is
said
to
have
happened
to
the
persians
for
if
this
which
i
have
related
had
in
truth
been
said
by
the
pilot
to
xerxes
not
one
person
opinion
in
ten
thousand
will
differ
from
mine
that
the
king
would
have
done
some
such
thing
as
this
that
is
to
say
he
would
have
caused
those
who
were
upon
the
deck
to
go
down
below
into
the
hold
seeing
that
they
were
persians
of
the
highest
rank
among
the
persians
and
of
the
rowers
who
were
phenicians
he
would
have
thrown
out
into
the
sea
a
number
equal
to
the
number
of
those
in
fact
however
as
i
have
said
before
he
made
his
return
to
asia
together
with
the
rest
of
the
army
by
road
and
this
also
which
follows
is
a
strong
witness
that
it
was
so
for
xerxes
is
known
to
have
come
to
abdera
on
his
way
back
and
to
have
made
with
them
a
and
presented
them
with
a
persian
sword
of
gold
and
a
tiara
and
as
the
men
of
abdera
themselves
say
though
i
for
my
part
can
by
no
means
believe
it
he
loosed
his
girdle
for
the
first
time
during
his
flight
back
from
athens
considering
himself
to
be
in
security
now
abdera
is
situated
further
towards
the
hellespont
than
the
river
strymon
and
eïon
from
which
place
the
story
says
that
he
embarked
in
the
ship
the
hellenes
meanwhile
when
it
proved
that
they
were
not
able
to
conquer
andros
turned
towards
carystos
and
having
laid
waste
the
land
of
that
people
they
departed
and
went
to
salamis
first
then
for
the
gods
they
chose
out
of
the
spoil
and
among
them
three
persian
triremes
one
to
be
dedicated
as
an
offering
at
the
isthmus
which
remained
there
still
up
to
my
time
another
at
sunion
and
the
third
to
ajax
in
salamis
where
they
were
after
this
they
divided
the
spoil
among
themselves
and
sent
the
to
delphi
of
which
was
made
a
statue
holding
in
its
hand
the
beak
of
a
ship
and
in
height
measuring
twelve
cubits
this
statue
stood
in
the
same
place
with
the
golden
statue
of
alexander
the
macedonian
then
when
the
hellenes
had
sent
to
delphi
they
asked
the
god
on
behalf
of
all
whether
the
which
he
had
received
were
fully
sufficient
and
acceptable
to
him
he
said
that
from
the
hellenes
he
had
received
enough
but
not
from
the
eginetans
and
from
them
he
demanded
the
offering
of
their
prize
of
valour
for
the
at
salamis
hearing
this
the
eginetans
dedicated
golden
stars
three
in
number
upon
a
ship
mast
of
bronze
which
are
placed
in
the
corner
close
to
the
of
croesus
after
the
division
of
the
spoil
the
hellenes
sailed
to
the
isthmus
to
give
the
prize
of
valour
to
him
who
of
all
the
hellenes
had
proved
himself
the
most
worthy
during
this
war
and
when
they
had
come
thither
and
the
commanders
distributed
their
votes
at
the
altar
of
poseidon
selecting
from
the
whole
number
the
first
and
the
second
in
merit
then
every
one
of
them
gave
in
his
vote
for
himself
each
man
thinking
that
he
himself
had
been
the
best
but
for
the
second
place
the
greater
number
of
votes
came
out
in
agreement
assigning
that
to
themistocles
they
then
were
left
alone
in
their
votes
while
themistocles
in
regard
to
the
second
place
surpassed
the
rest
by
far
and
although
the
hellenes
would
not
give
decision
of
this
by
reason
of
envy
but
sailed
away
each
to
their
own
city
without
deciding
yet
themistocles
was
loudly
reported
of
and
was
esteemed
throughout
hellas
to
be
the
man
who
was
the
ablest
by
far
of
the
hellenes
and
since
he
had
not
received
honour
from
those
who
had
fought
at
salamis
although
he
was
the
first
in
the
voting
he
went
forthwith
after
this
to
lacedemon
desiring
to
receive
honour
there
and
the
lacedemonians
received
him
well
and
gave
him
great
honours
as
a
prize
of
valour
they
gave
to
eurybiades
a
wreath
of
olive
and
for
ability
and
skill
they
gave
to
themistocles
also
a
wreath
of
olive
and
presented
him
besides
with
the
chariot
which
was
judged
to
be
the
best
in
sparta
so
having
much
commended
him
they
escorted
him
on
his
departure
with
three
hundred
picked
men
of
the
spartans
the
same
who
are
called
the
horsemen
as
far
as
the
boundaries
of
tegea
and
he
is
the
only
man
of
all
we
know
to
whom
the
spartans
ever
gave
escort
on
his
way
when
however
he
had
come
to
athens
from
lacedemon
timodemos
of
aphidnai
one
of
the
opponents
of
themistocles
but
in
other
respects
not
among
the
men
of
distinction
maddened
by
envy
attacked
him
bringing
forward
against
him
his
going
to
lacedemon
and
saying
that
it
was
on
account
of
athens
that
he
had
those
marks
of
honour
which
he
had
from
the
lacedemonians
and
not
on
his
own
account
then
as
timodemos
continued
ceaselessly
to
repeat
this
themistocles
said
i
tell
thee
thus
it
is
i
had
been
a
native
of
belbina
i
should
never
have
been
thus
honoured
by
the
spartans
but
neither
wouldest
thou
my
friend
for
all
that
thou
art
an
athenian
so
far
then
went
these
matters
artabazos
meanwhile
the
son
of
pharnakes
a
man
who
was
held
in
esteem
among
the
persians
even
before
this
and
came
to
be
so
yet
more
after
the
events
about
plataia
was
escorting
the
king
as
far
as
the
passage
with
six
myriads
of
that
army
which
mardonios
had
selected
for
himself
and
when
the
king
was
in
asia
and
artabazos
on
his
march
back
came
near
to
pallene
finding
that
mardonios
was
wintering
in
thessaly
and
macedonia
and
was
not
at
present
urgent
with
him
to
come
and
join
the
rest
of
the
army
he
thought
it
not
good
to
pass
by
without
reducing
the
potidaians
to
slavery
whom
he
had
found
in
revolt
for
the
men
of
potidaia
when
the
king
had
marched
by
them
and
when
the
fleet
of
the
persians
had
departed
in
flight
from
salamis
had
openly
made
revolt
from
the
barbarians
and
so
also
had
the
others
done
who
occupy
pallene
so
upon
this
artabazos
began
to
besiege
potidaia
and
suspecting
that
the
men
of
olynthos
also
were
intending
revolt
from
the
king
he
began
to
besiege
this
city
too
which
was
occupied
by
bottiaians
who
had
been
driven
away
from
the
thermaian
gulf
by
the
macedonians
so
when
he
had
taken
these
men
by
siege
he
brought
them
forth
to
a
lake
and
slew
them
there
and
the
city
he
delivered
to
critobulos
of
torone
to
have
in
charge
and
to
the
natives
of
chalkidike
and
thus
it
was
that
the
chalkidians
got
possession
of
olynthos
having
taken
this
city
artabazos
set
himself
to
attack
potidaia
with
vigour
and
as
he
was
setting
himself
earnestly
to
this
work
timoxeinos
the
commander
of
the
troops
from
skione
concerted
with
him
to
give
up
the
town
by
treachery
now
in
what
manner
he
did
this
at
the
first
i
for
my
part
am
not
able
to
say
for
this
is
not
reported
at
last
however
it
happened
as
follows
whenever
either
timoxeinos
wrote
a
paper
wishing
to
send
it
to
artabazos
or
artabazos
wishing
to
send
one
to
timoxeinos
they
wound
it
round
by
the
of
an
arrow
and
then
putting
feathers
over
the
paper
they
shot
it
to
a
place
agreed
upon
between
them
it
came
however
to
be
found
out
that
timoxeinos
was
attempting
by
treachery
to
give
up
potidaia
for
artabazos
shooting
an
arrow
at
the
place
agreed
upon
missed
this
spot
and
struck
a
man
of
potidaia
in
the
shoulder
and
when
he
was
struck
a
crowd
came
about
him
as
is
apt
to
happen
when
there
is
fighting
and
they
forthwith
took
the
arrow
and
having
discovered
the
paper
carried
it
to
the
commanders
now
there
was
present
an
allied
force
of
the
other
men
of
pallene
also
then
when
the
commanders
had
read
the
paper
and
discovered
who
was
guilty
of
the
treachery
they
resolved
not
openly
to
convict
timoxeinos
of
treachery
for
the
sake
of
the
city
of
skione
lest
the
men
of
skione
should
be
esteemed
traitors
for
all
time
to
come
he
then
in
such
a
manner
as
this
had
been
discovered
and
when
three
months
had
gone
by
while
artabazos
was
besieging
the
town
there
came
to
be
a
great
ebb
of
the
sea
backwards
which
lasted
for
a
long
time
and
the
barbarians
seeing
that
shallow
water
had
been
produced
endeavoured
to
get
by
into
the
peninsula
of
pallene
but
when
they
had
passed
through
two
of
the
distance
and
yet
remained
which
they
must
pass
through
before
they
were
within
pallene
then
there
came
upon
them
a
great
of
the
sea
higher
than
ever
before
as
the
natives
of
the
place
say
though
high
tides
come
often
so
those
of
them
who
could
not
swim
perished
and
those
who
could
were
slain
by
the
men
of
potidaia
who
put
out
to
them
in
boats
the
cause
of
the
high
tide
and
flood
and
of
that
which
befell
the
persians
was
this
as
the
potidaians
say
namely
that
these
same
persians
who
perished
by
means
of
the
sea
had
committed
impiety
towards
the
temple
of
poseidon
and
his
image
in
the
suburb
of
their
town
and
in
saying
that
this
was
the
cause
in
my
opinion
they
say
well
the
survivors
of
his
army
artabazos
led
away
to
thessaly
to
join
mardonios
thus
it
fared
with
these
who
escorted
the
king
on
his
way
the
fleet
of
xerxes
so
much
of
it
as
remained
when
it
had
touched
asia
in
its
flight
from
salamis
and
had
conveyed
the
king
and
his
army
over
from
the
chersonese
to
abydos
passed
the
winter
at
kyme
and
when
spring
dawned
upon
it
it
assembled
early
at
samos
where
some
of
the
ships
had
even
passed
the
winter
and
most
of
the
persians
and
medes
still
served
as
on
board
of
them
to
be
commanders
of
them
there
came
mardontes
the
son
of
bagaios
and
artaÿntes
the
son
of
artachaies
and
with
them
also
ithamitres
was
in
joint
command
who
was
brother
son
to
artaÿntes
and
had
been
added
by
the
choice
of
artaÿntes
himself
they
then
since
they
had
suffered
a
heavy
blow
did
not
advance
further
up
towards
the
west
nor
did
any
one
compel
them
to
do
so
but
they
remained
still
in
samos
and
kept
watch
over
ionia
lest
it
should
revolt
having
three
hundred
ships
including
those
of
the
ionians
and
they
did
not
expect
that
the
hellenes
on
their
part
would
come
to
ionia
but
thought
that
it
would
satisfy
them
to
guard
their
own
land
judging
from
the
fact
that
they
had
not
pursued
after
them
in
their
flight
from
salamis
but
were
well
contented
then
to
depart
homewards
as
regards
the
sea
then
their
spirit
was
broken
but
on
land
they
thought
that
mardonios
would
get
much
the
advantage
so
they
being
at
samos
were
taking
counsel
to
do
some
damage
if
they
could
to
their
enemies
and
at
the
same
time
they
were
listening
for
news
how
the
affairs
of
mardonios
would
fall
out
the
hellenes
on
their
part
were
roused
both
by
the
coming
on
of
spring
and
by
the
presence
of
mardonios
in
thessaly
their
had
not
yet
begun
to
assemble
when
the
fleet
arrived
at
egina
in
number
one
hundred
and
ten
ships
and
the
commander
and
admiral
was
leotychides
who
was
the
son
of
menares
the
son
of
hegesilaos
the
son
of
hippocratides
the
son
of
leotychides
the
son
of
anaxilaos
the
son
of
archidemos
the
son
of
anaxandriddes
the
son
of
theopompos
the
son
of
nicander
the
son
of
charilaos
the
son
of
eunomos
the
son
of
polydectes
the
son
of
prytanis
the
son
of
euryphon
the
son
of
procles
the
son
of
aristodemos
the
son
of
aristomachos
the
son
of
cleodaios
the
son
of
hyllos
the
son
of
heracles
being
of
the
other
royal
house
these
all
except
the
two
enumerated
first
after
leotychides
had
been
kings
of
sparta
and
of
the
athenians
the
commander
was
xanthippos
the
son
of
ariphon
when
all
the
ships
had
arrived
at
egina
there
came
ionian
envoys
to
the
camp
of
the
hellenes
who
also
came
a
short
time
before
this
to
sparta
and
asked
the
lacedemonians
to
set
ionia
free
and
of
them
one
was
herodotus
the
son
of
basileides
these
had
banded
themselves
together
and
had
plotted
to
put
to
death
strattis
the
despot
of
chios
being
originally
seven
in
number
but
when
one
of
those
who
took
part
with
them
gave
information
of
it
and
they
were
discovered
to
be
plotting
against
him
then
the
remaining
six
escaped
from
chios
and
came
both
to
sparta
and
also
at
this
time
to
egina
asking
the
hellenes
to
sail
over
to
ionia
but
they
with
difficulty
brought
them
forward
as
far
as
delos
for
the
parts
beyond
this
were
all
fearful
to
the
hellenes
since
they
were
without
experience
of
those
regions
and
everything
seemed
to
them
to
be
filled
with
armed
force
while
their
persuasion
was
that
it
was
as
long
a
voyage
to
samos
as
to
the
pillars
of
heracles
thus
at
the
same
time
it
so
chanced
that
the
barbarians
dared
sail
no
further
up
towards
the
west
than
samos
being
smitten
with
fear
and
the
hellenes
no
further
down
towards
the
east
than
delos
when
the
chians
made
request
of
them
so
fear
was
guard
of
the
space
which
lay
between
them
the
hellenes
i
say
sailed
to
delos
and
mardonios
meanwhile
had
been
wintering
in
thessaly
from
thence
he
sent
round
a
man
a
native
of
europos
whose
name
was
mys
to
the
various
oracles
charging
him
to
go
everywhere
to
consult
wherever
they
were
permitted
to
make
trial
of
the
oracles
what
he
desired
to
find
out
from
the
oracles
when
he
gave
this
charge
i
am
not
able
to
say
for
that
is
not
reported
but
i
conceive
for
my
part
that
he
sent
to
consult
about
his
present
affairs
and
not
about
other
things
this
mys
is
known
to
have
come
to
lebadeia
and
to
have
persuaded
by
payment
of
money
one
of
the
natives
of
the
place
to
go
down
to
trophonios
and
also
he
came
to
the
oracle
at
abai
of
the
phokians
and
moreover
when
he
came
for
the
first
time
to
thebes
he
not
only
consulted
the
ismenian
apollo
one
may
consult
just
as
at
olympia
with
victims
also
by
payment
he
persuaded
a
stranger
who
was
not
a
theban
and
induced
him
to
lie
down
to
sleep
in
the
temple
of
amphiaraos
in
this
temple
no
one
of
the
thebans
is
permitted
to
seek
divination
and
that
for
the
following
reason
dealing
by
oracles
bade
them
choose
which
they
would
of
these
two
things
either
to
have
him
as
a
diviner
or
else
as
an
ally
in
war
abstaining
from
the
other
use
and
they
chose
that
he
should
be
their
ally
in
war
for
this
reason
it
is
not
permitted
to
any
of
the
thebans
to
lie
down
to
sleep
in
that
temple
after
this
a
thing
which
to
me
is
a
very
great
marvel
is
said
by
the
thebans
to
have
come
to
pass
seems
that
this
man
mys
of
europos
as
he
journeyed
round
to
all
the
oracles
came
also
to
the
sacred
enclosure
of
the
ptoan
apollo
this
temple
is
called
ptoon
and
belongs
to
the
thebans
and
it
lies
above
the
lake
copaïs
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
close
to
the
town
of
acraiphia
when
the
man
called
mys
came
to
this
temple
with
three
men
chosen
from
the
citizens
in
his
company
who
were
sent
by
the
public
authority
to
write
down
that
which
the
god
should
utter
in
his
divination
forthwith
it
is
said
the
prophet
of
the
god
began
to
give
the
oracle
in
a
barbarian
tongue
and
while
those
of
the
thebans
who
accompanied
him
were
full
of
wonder
hearing
a
barbarian
instead
of
the
hellenic
tongue
and
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
the
matter
before
them
it
is
said
that
the
man
of
europos
mys
snatched
from
them
the
tablet
which
they
bore
and
wrote
upon
it
that
which
was
being
spoken
by
the
prophet
and
he
said
that
the
prophet
was
giving
his
answer
in
the
carian
tongue
and
then
when
he
had
written
it
he
went
away
and
departed
to
thessaly
mardonios
having
read
that
which
the
oracles
uttered
whatever
that
was
after
this
sent
as
an
envoy
to
athens
alexander
the
son
of
amyntas
the
macedonian
both
because
the
persians
were
connected
with
him
by
marriage
for
gygaia
the
sister
of
alexander
and
daughter
of
amyntas
had
been
married
to
a
persian
bubares
and
from
her
had
been
born
to
him
that
amyntas
who
lived
in
asia
having
the
name
of
his
father
to
whom
the
king
gave
alabanda
a
great
city
of
phrygia
to
possess
and
also
mardonios
was
sending
him
because
he
was
informed
that
alexander
was
a
public
and
benefactor
of
the
athenians
for
by
this
means
he
thought
that
he
would
be
most
likely
to
gain
over
the
athenians
to
his
side
about
whom
he
heard
that
they
were
a
numerous
people
and
brave
in
war
and
of
whom
he
knew
moreover
that
these
were
they
who
more
than
any
others
had
brought
about
the
disasters
which
had
befallen
the
persians
by
sea
therefore
if
these
should
be
added
to
him
he
thought
that
he
should
easily
have
command
of
the
sea
and
this
in
fact
would
have
been
the
case
while
on
land
he
supposed
himself
to
be
already
much
superior
in
force
thus
he
reckoned
that
his
power
would
be
much
greater
than
that
of
the
hellenes
perhaps
also
the
oracles
told
him
this
beforehand
counselling
him
to
make
the
athenian
his
ally
and
so
he
was
sending
in
obedience
to
their
advice
now
of
this
alexander
the
seventh
ancestor
was
that
perdiccas
who
first
became
despot
of
the
macedonians
and
that
in
the
manner
which
here
follows
argos
there
fled
to
the
illyrians
three
brothers
of
the
descendents
of
temenos
gauanes
aëropos
and
perdiccas
and
passing
over
from
the
illyrians
into
the
upper
parts
of
macedonia
they
came
to
the
city
of
lebaia
there
they
became
for
pay
in
the
household
of
the
king
one
pasturing
horses
the
second
oxen
and
the
youngest
of
them
namely
perdiccas
the
smaller
kinds
of
cattle
for
in
ancient
times
even
those
who
were
rulers
over
men
were
poor
in
money
and
not
the
common
people
only
and
the
wife
of
the
king
cooked
for
them
their
food
herself
and
whenever
she
baked
the
loaf
of
the
boy
their
servant
namely
perdiccas
became
double
as
large
as
by
nature
it
should
be
when
this
happened
constantly
in
the
same
manner
she
told
it
to
her
husband
and
he
when
he
heard
it
conceived
forthwith
that
this
was
a
portent
and
tended
to
something
great
he
summoned
the
therefore
and
gave
notice
to
them
to
depart
out
of
his
land
and
they
said
that
it
was
right
that
before
they
went
forth
they
should
receive
the
wages
which
were
due
now
it
chanced
that
the
sun
was
shining
into
the
house
down
through
the
opening
which
received
the
smoke
and
the
king
when
he
heard
about
the
wages
said
being
infatuated
by
a
divine
power
i
pay
you
then
this
for
wages
and
it
is
such
as
ye
deserve
pointing
to
the
sunlight
so
then
gauanes
and
aëropos
the
elder
brothers
stood
struck
with
amazement
when
they
heard
this
but
the
boy
who
happened
to
have
in
his
hand
a
knife
said
these
words
we
accept
o
king
that
which
thou
dost
give
and
he
traced
a
line
with
his
knife
round
the
sunlight
on
the
floor
of
the
house
and
having
traced
the
line
round
he
thrice
drew
of
the
sunlight
into
his
bosom
and
after
that
he
departed
both
himself
and
his
fellows
they
then
were
going
away
and
to
the
king
one
of
those
who
sat
by
him
at
table
told
what
manner
of
thing
the
boy
had
done
and
how
the
youngest
of
them
had
taken
that
which
was
given
with
some
design
and
he
hearing
this
and
being
moved
with
anger
sent
after
them
horsemen
to
slay
them
now
there
is
a
river
in
this
land
to
which
the
descendents
of
these
men
from
argos
sacrifice
as
a
saviour
this
river
so
soon
as
the
sons
of
temenos
had
passed
over
it
began
to
flow
with
such
great
volume
of
water
that
the
horsemen
became
unable
to
pass
over
so
the
brothers
having
come
to
another
region
of
macedonia
took
up
their
dwelling
near
the
gardens
of
midas
the
son
of
gordias
where
roses
grow
wild
which
have
each
one
sixty
petals
and
excel
all
others
in
perfume
in
these
gardens
too
silenos
was
captured
as
is
reported
by
the
macedonians
and
above
the
gardens
is
situated
a
mountain
called
bermion
which
is
inaccessible
by
reason
of
the
cold
having
taken
possession
of
that
region
they
made
this
their
and
proceeded
to
subdue
also
the
rest
of
macedonia
from
this
perdiccas
the
descent
of
alexander
was
as
follows
was
the
son
of
amyntas
amyntas
was
the
son
of
alketes
the
father
of
alketes
was
aëropos
of
him
philip
of
philip
argaios
and
of
this
last
the
father
was
perdiccas
who
first
obtained
the
kingdom
thus
then
i
say
alexander
the
son
of
amyntas
was
descended
and
when
he
came
to
athens
sent
from
mardonios
he
spoke
as
follows
a
athenians
mardonios
speaks
these
words
has
come
to
me
a
message
from
the
king
which
speaks
in
this
manner
the
athenians
i
remit
all
the
offences
which
were
committed
against
me
and
now
mardonios
thus
do
give
them
back
their
own
land
then
let
them
choose
for
themselves
another
in
addition
to
this
whichsoever
they
desire
remaining
independent
and
set
up
for
them
again
all
their
temples
which
i
set
on
fire
provided
that
they
consent
to
make
a
treaty
with
me
this
message
having
come
to
me
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
do
so
unless
by
your
means
i
am
prevented
and
thus
i
speak
to
you
now
are
ye
so
mad
as
to
raise
up
war
against
the
king
since
neither
will
ye
overcome
him
nor
are
ye
able
to
hold
out
against
him
for
ever
for
ye
saw
the
multitude
of
the
host
of
xerxes
and
their
deeds
and
ye
are
informed
also
of
the
power
which
is
with
me
at
the
present
time
so
that
even
if
ye
overcome
and
conquer
us
of
which
ye
can
have
no
hope
if
ye
are
rightly
minded
another
power
will
come
many
times
as
large
do
not
ye
then
desire
to
match
yourselves
with
the
king
and
so
to
be
both
deprived
of
your
land
and
for
ever
running
a
course
for
your
own
lives
but
make
peace
with
him
and
ye
have
a
most
honourable
occasion
to
make
peace
since
the
king
has
himself
set
out
upon
this
road
agree
to
a
league
with
us
then
without
fraud
or
deceit
and
remain
free
b
these
things
mardonios
charged
me
to
say
to
you
o
athenians
and
as
for
me
i
will
say
nothing
of
the
goodwill
towards
you
on
my
part
for
ye
would
not
learn
that
now
for
the
first
time
but
i
ask
of
you
to
do
as
mardonios
says
since
i
perceive
that
ye
will
not
be
able
to
war
with
xerxes
for
ever
i
perceived
in
you
ability
to
do
this
i
should
never
have
come
to
you
speaking
these
words
the
power
of
the
king
is
above
that
of
a
man
and
his
arm
is
very
long
if
therefore
ye
do
not
make
an
agreement
forthwith
when
they
offer
you
great
things
as
the
terms
on
which
they
are
willing
to
make
a
treaty
i
have
fear
on
your
behalf
seeing
that
ye
dwell
more
upon
the
highway
than
any
of
your
allies
and
are
exposed
ever
to
destruction
alone
the
land
which
ye
possess
being
parted
off
from
the
rest
and
lying
between
the
armies
which
are
contending
together
nay
but
be
persuaded
for
this
is
a
matter
of
great
consequence
to
you
that
to
you
alone
of
the
hellenes
the
great
king
remits
the
offences
committed
and
desires
to
become
a
friend
thus
spoke
alexander
and
the
lacedemonians
having
been
informed
that
alexander
had
come
to
athens
to
bring
the
athenians
to
make
a
treaty
with
the
barbarians
and
remembering
the
oracles
who
it
was
destined
that
they
together
with
the
other
dorians
should
be
driven
forth
out
of
the
peloponnese
by
the
medes
and
the
athenians
combined
had
been
very
greatly
afraid
lest
the
athenians
should
make
a
treaty
with
the
persians
and
forthwith
they
had
resolved
to
send
envoys
it
happened
moreover
that
they
were
introduced
at
the
same
time
with
alexander
for
the
athenians
had
waited
for
them
protracting
the
time
because
they
were
well
assured
that
the
lacedemonians
would
hear
that
an
envoy
had
come
from
the
barbarians
to
make
a
treaty
and
that
having
heard
it
they
would
themselves
send
envoys
with
all
speed
they
acted
therefore
of
set
purpose
so
as
to
let
the
lacedemonians
see
their
inclination
so
when
alexander
had
ceased
speaking
the
envoys
from
sparta
followed
him
forthwith
and
said
as
for
us
the
lacedemonians
sent
us
to
ask
of
you
not
to
make
any
change
in
that
which
concerns
hellas
nor
to
accept
proposals
from
the
barbarian
since
this
is
not
just
in
any
way
nor
honourable
for
any
of
the
hellenes
to
do
but
least
of
all
for
you
and
that
for
many
reasons
ye
were
they
who
stirred
up
this
war
when
we
by
no
means
willed
it
and
the
contest
came
about
for
your
dominion
but
now
it
extends
even
to
the
whole
of
hellas
besides
this
it
is
by
no
means
to
be
endured
that
ye
athenians
who
are
the
authors
of
all
this
should
prove
to
be
the
cause
of
slavery
to
the
hellenes
seeing
that
ye
ever
from
ancient
time
also
have
been
known
as
the
liberators
of
many
we
feel
sympathy
however
with
you
for
your
sufferings
and
because
ye
were
deprived
of
your
crops
twice
and
have
had
your
substance
ruined
now
for
a
long
time
in
compensation
for
this
the
lacedemonians
and
their
allies
make
offer
to
support
your
wives
and
all
those
of
your
households
who
are
unfitted
for
war
so
long
as
this
war
shall
last
but
let
not
alexander
the
macedonian
persuade
you
making
smooth
the
speech
of
mardonios
for
these
things
are
fitting
for
him
to
do
since
being
himself
a
despot
he
is
working
in
league
with
a
despot
for
you
however
they
are
not
fitting
to
do
if
ye
chance
to
be
rightly
minded
for
ye
know
that
in
barbarians
there
is
neither
faith
nor
truth
at
all
thus
spoke
the
envoys
and
to
alexander
the
athenians
made
answer
thus
even
of
ourselves
we
know
so
much
that
the
mede
has
a
power
many
times
as
numerous
as
ours
so
that
there
is
no
need
for
thee
to
cast
this
up
against
us
nevertheless
because
we
long
for
liberty
we
shall
defend
ourselves
as
we
may
be
able
and
do
not
thou
endeavour
to
persuade
us
to
make
a
treaty
with
the
barbarian
for
we
on
our
part
shall
not
be
persuaded
and
now
report
to
mardonios
that
the
athenians
say
thus
long
as
the
sun
goes
on
the
same
course
by
which
he
goes
now
we
will
never
make
an
agreement
with
xerxes
but
we
will
go
forth
to
defend
ourselves
against
him
trusting
in
the
gods
and
the
heroes
as
allies
for
whom
he
had
no
respect
when
he
set
fire
to
their
houses
and
to
their
sacred
images
and
in
the
future
do
not
thou
appear
before
the
athenians
with
any
such
proposals
as
these
nor
think
that
thou
art
rendering
them
good
service
in
advising
them
to
do
that
which
is
not
lawful
for
we
do
not
desire
that
thou
shouldest
suffer
anything
unpleasant
at
the
hands
of
the
athenians
who
art
their
public
guest
and
friend
to
alexander
they
thus
made
answer
but
to
the
envoys
from
sparta
as
follows
that
the
lacedemonians
should
be
afraid
lest
we
should
make
a
treaty
with
the
barbarian
was
natural
no
doubt
but
it
seems
to
be
an
unworthy
fear
for
men
who
know
so
well
the
spirit
of
the
athenians
namely
that
there
is
neither
so
great
quantity
of
gold
anywhere
upon
the
earth
nor
any
land
so
much
excelling
in
beauty
and
goodness
that
we
should
be
willing
to
accept
it
and
enslave
hellas
by
taking
the
side
of
the
medes
for
many
and
great
are
the
reasons
which
hinder
us
from
doing
this
even
though
we
should
desire
it
first
and
greatest
the
images
and
houses
of
the
gods
set
on
fire
or
reduced
to
ruin
which
we
must
necessarily
avenge
to
the
very
utmost
rather
than
make
an
agreement
with
him
who
did
these
deeds
then
secondly
there
is
the
bond
of
hellenic
race
by
which
we
are
of
one
blood
and
of
one
speech
the
common
temples
of
the
gods
and
the
common
sacrifices
the
manners
of
life
which
are
the
same
for
all
to
these
it
would
not
be
well
that
the
athenians
should
become
traitors
and
be
assured
of
this
if
by
any
chance
ye
were
not
assured
of
it
before
that
so
long
as
one
of
the
athenians
remains
alive
we
will
never
make
an
agreement
with
xerxes
we
admire
however
the
forethought
which
ye
had
with
regard
to
us
in
that
ye
took
thought
for
us
who
have
had
our
substance
destroyed
and
are
willing
to
support
the
members
of
our
households
and
so
far
as
ye
are
concerned
the
kindness
has
been
fully
performed
but
we
shall
continue
to
endure
as
we
may
and
not
be
a
trouble
in
any
way
to
you
now
therefore
with
full
conviction
this
is
so
send
out
an
army
as
speedily
as
ye
may
for
as
we
conjecture
the
barbarian
will
be
here
invading
our
land
at
no
far
distant
time
but
so
soon
as
he
shall
be
informed
of
the
message
sent
namely
that
we
shall
do
none
of
those
things
which
he
desired
of
us
therefore
before
he
arrives
here
in
attica
it
is
fitting
that
ye
come
to
our
rescue
quickly
in
boeotia

came
he
took

land
the

did

which

endeavoured

counselled
him
saying
that
there
was
no
region
more
convenient
for
him
to
have
his
encampment
than
that
and
they
urged
him
not
to
advance
further
but
to
sit
down
there
and
endeavour
to
subdue
to
himself
the
whole
of
hellas
without
fighting
for
to
overcome
the
hellenes
by
open
force
when
they
were
united
as
at
the
former
time
they
were
of
one
accord
together
was
a
difficult
task
even
for
the
whole
world
combined
but
they
proceeded
if
thou
wilt
do
that
which
we
advise
with
little
labour
thou
wilt
have
in
thy
power
all
their
plans
of

send
money
to
the

who
have
power
in
their
cities

thus
sending
thou
wilt
divide
hellas

parties
after
that
thou
wilt
with
ease
subdue
by
the
help
of
thy
party
those
who
are
not
inclined
to
thy
thus
they
advised
but
he
did
not
follow
their
counsel
for
there
had
instilled
itself
into
him
a
great
desire
to
take
athens
for
the
second
time
partly
from
obstinacy
and
partly
because
he
meant
to
signify
to
the
king
in
sardis
that
he
was
in
possession
of
athens
by
through
the
islands
however
he
did
not
even
at
this
time
find
the
athenians
there
when
he
came
to
attica
but
he
was
informed
that
the
greater
number
were
either
in
salamis
or
in
the
ships
and
he
captured
the
city
finding
it
deserted
now
the
capture
of
the
city
by
the
king
had
taken
place
ten
months
before
the
later
expedition
of
mardonios
against
it
when
mardonios
had
come
to
athens
he
sent
to
salamis
morychides
a
man
of
the
hellespont
bearing
the
same
proposals
as
alexander
the
macedonian
had
brought
over
to
the
athenians
these
he
sent
for
the
second
time
being
aware
beforehand
that
the
dispositions
of
the
athenians
were
not
friendly
but
hoping
that
they
would
give
way
and
leave
their
obstinacy
since
the
attic
land
had
been
captured
by
the
enemy
and
was
in
his
for
this
reason
he
sent
morychides
to
salamis
and
he
came
before
the
council
and
reported
the
words
of
mardonios
then
one
of
the
councillors
lykidas
expressed
the
opinion
that
it
was
better
to
receive
the
proposal
which
morychides
brought
before
them
and
refer
it
to
the
assembly
of
the
people
he
i
say
uttered
this
opinion
whether
because
he
had
received
money
from
mardonios
or
because
this
was
his
own
inclination
however
the
athenians
forthwith
both
those
of
the
council
and
those
outside
when
they
heard
of
it
were
very
indignant
and
they
came
about
lykidas
and
stoned
him
to
death
but
the
hellespontian
morychides
they
dismissed
unhurt
then
when
there
had
arisen
much
uproar
in
salamis
about
lykidas
the
women
of
the
athenians
heard
of
that
which
was
being
done
and
one
woman
passing
the
word
to
another
and
one
taking
another
with
her
they
went
of
their
own
accord
to
the
house
of
lykidas
and
stoned
his
wife
and
his
children
to
death
the
athenians
had
passed
over
to
salamis
as
follows
long
as
they
were
looking
that
an
army
should
come
from
the
peloponnese
to
help
them
they
remained
in
attica
but
as
those
in
peloponnesus
acted
very
slowly
and
with
much
delay
while
the
invader
was
said
to
be
already
in
boeotia
they
accordingly
removed
everything
out
of
danger
and
themselves
passed
over
to
salamis
and
at
the
same
time
they
sent
envoys
to
lacedemon
to
reproach
the
lacedemonians
for
having
permitted
the
barbarian
to
invade
attica
and
for
not
having
gone
to
boeotia
to
meet
him
in
company
with
them
and
also
to
remind
them
how
many
things
the
persian
had
promised
to
give
the
athenians
if
they
changed
sides
bidding
the
envoys
warn
them
that
if
they
did
not
help
the
athenians
the
athenians
would
find
some
shelter
for
for
the
lacedemonians
in
fact
were
keeping
a
feast
during
this
time
and
celebrating
the
hyakinthia
and
they
held
it
of
the
greatest
consequence
to
provide
for
the
things
which
concerned
the
god
while
at
the
same
time
their
wall
which
they
had
been
building
at
the
isthmus
was
just
at
this
moment
being
completed
with
battlements
and
when
the
envoys
from
the
athenians
came
to
lacedemon
bringing
with
them
also
envoys
from
megara
and
plataia
they
came
in
before
the
ephors
and
said
as
follows
the
athenians
sent
us
saying
that
the
king
of
the
medes
not
only
offers
to
give
us
back
our
land
but
also
desires
to
make
us
his
allies
on
fair
and
equal
terms
without
deceit
or
treachery
and
is
desirous
moreover
to
give
us
another
land
in
addition
to
our
own
whichsoever
we
shall
ourselves
choose
we
however
having
respect
for
zeus
of
the
hellenes
and
disdaining
to
be
traitors
to
hellas
did
not
agree
but
refused
although
we
were
unjustly
dealt
with
by
the
other
hellenes
and
left
to
destruction
and
although
we
knew
that
it
was
more
profitable
to
make
a
treaty
with
the
persian
than
to
carry
on
war
nor
shall
we
make
a
treaty
at
any
future
time
if
we
have
our
own
will
thus
sincerely
is
our
duty
done
towards
the
hellenes
but
as
for
you
after
having
come
then
to
great
dread
lest
we
should
make
a
treaty
with
the
persian
so
soon
as
ye
learnt
certainly
what
our
spirit
was
namely
that
we
should
never
betray
hellas
and
because
your
wall
across
the
isthmus
is
all
but
finished
now
ye
make
no
account
of
the
athenians
but
having
agreed
with
us
to
come
to
boeotia
to
oppose
the
persian
ye
have
now
deserted
us
and
ye
permitted
the
barbarian
moreover
to
make
invasion
of
attica
for
the
present
then
the
athenians
have
anger
against
you
for
ye
did
not
do
as
was
fitting
to
be
done
and
now
they
bid
you
with
all
speed
send
out
an
army
together
with
us
in
order
that
we
may
receive
the
barbarian
in
the
land
of
attica
for
since
we
failed
of
boeotia
the
most
suitable
place
to
fight
in
our
land
is
the
thriasian
when
the
ephors
heard
this
they
deferred
their
reply
to
the
next
day
and
then
on
the
next
day
to
the
succeeding
one
and
this
they
did
even
for
ten
days
deferring
the
matter
from
day
to
day
while
during
this
time
the
whole
body
of
the
peloponnesians
were
building
the
wall
over
the
isthmus
with
great
diligence
and
were
just
about
to
complete
it
now
i
am
not
able
to
say
why
when
alexander
the
macedonian
had
come
to
athens
they
were
so
very
anxious
lest
the
athenians
should
take
the
side
of
the
medes
whereas
now
they
had
no
care
about
it
except
indeed
that
their
wall
over
the
isthmus
had
now
been
built
and
they
thought
they
had
no
need
of
the
athenians
any
more
whereas
when
alexander
came
to
attica
the
wall
had
not
yet
been
completed
but
they
were
working
at
it
in
great
dread
of
the
at
last
however
the
answer
was
given
and
the
going
forth
of
the
spartans
took
place
in
the
following
manner
the
day
before
that
which
was
appointed
for
the
last
hearing
of
the
envoys
chileos
a
man
of
tegea
who
of
all
strangers
had
most
influence
in
lacedemon
heard
from
the
ephors
all
that
which
the
athenians
were
saying
and
he
it
seems
said
to
them
these
words
thus
the
matter
stands
ephors
the
athenians
are
not
friendly
with
us
but
are
allies
of
the
barbarian
then
though
a
strong
wall
may
have
been
built
across
the
isthmus
yet
a
wide
door
has
been
opened
for
the
persian
into
peloponnesus
listen
to
their
request
however
before
the
athenians
resolve
upon
something
else
tending
to
the
fall
of
thus
he
counselled
them
and
they
forthwith
took
his
words
to
heart
and
saying
nothing
to
the
envoys
who
had
come
from
the
cities
while
yet
it
was
night
they
sent
out
five
thousand
spartans
with
no
less
than
seven
of
the
helots
set
to
attend
upon
each
man
of
them
appointing
pausanias
the
son
of
cleombrotos
to
lead
them
forth
now
the
leadership
belonged
to
pleistarchos
the
son
of
leonidas
but
he
was
yet
a
boy
and
the
other
was
his
guardian
and
cousin
for
cleombrotos
the
father
of
pausanias
and
son
of
anaxandrides
was
no
longer
alive
but
when
he
had
led
home
from
the
isthmus
the
army
which
had
built
the
wall
no
long
time
after
this
he
died
now
the
reason
why
cleombrotos
led
home
the
army
from
the
isthmus
was
this
he
was
offering
sacrifice
for
fighting
against
the
persian
the
sun
was
darkened
in
the
heaven
and
pausanias
chose
as
commander
in
addition
to
himself
euryanax
the
son
of
dorieos
a
man
of
the
same
so
pausanias
with
his
army
had
gone
forth
out
of
sparta
and
the
envoys
when
day
had
come
not
knowing
anything
of
this
going
forth
came
in
before
the
ephors
meaning
to
depart
also
each
to
his
own
state
and
when
they
had
come
in
before
them
they
said
these
words
ye
o
lacedemonians
are
remaining
here
and
celebrating
this
hyakinthia
and
disporting
yourselves
having
left
your
allies
to
destruction
and
the
athenians
being
wronged
by
you
and
for
want
of
allies
will
make
peace
with
the
persians
on
such
terms
as
they
can
and
having
made
peace
evidently
we
become
allies
of
the
king
and
therefore
we
shall
join
with
him
in
expeditions
against
any
land
to
which
the
persians
may
lead
us
and
ye
will
learn
then
what
shall
be
the
issue
for
you
of
this
matter
when
the
envoys
spoke
these
words
the
ephors
said
and
confirmed
it
with
an
oath
that
they
supposed
by
this
time
the
men
were
at
orestheion
on
their
way
against
the
strangers
for
they
used
to
call
the
barbarians
strangers
so
they
not
knowing
of
the
matter
asked
the
meaning
of
these
words
and
asking
they
learnt
all
the
truth
so
that
they
were
struck
with
amazement
and
set
forth
as
quickly
as
possible
in
pursuit
and
together
with
them
five
thousand
chosen
hoplites
of
the
lacedemonian
dwellers
in
the
country
round
did
the
same
thing
also
they
then
i
say
were
hastening
towards
the
isthmus
and
the
argives
so
soon
as
they
heard
that
pausanias
with
his
army
had
gone
forth
from
sparta
sent
as
a
herald
to
attica
the
best
whom
they
could
find
of
the
runners
because
they
had
before
of
their
own
motion
engaged
for
mardonios
that
they
would
stop
the
spartans
from
going
forth
and
the
herald
when
he
came
to
athens
spoke
as
follows
mardonios
the
argives
sent
me
to
tell
thee
that
the
young
men
have
gone
forth
from
lacedemon
and
that
the
argives
are
not
able
to
stop
them
from
going
forth
with
regard
to
this
therefore
may
it
be
thy
fortune
to
take
measures
well
he
having
spoken
thus
departed
and
went
back
and
mardonios
was
by
no
means
anxious
any
more
to
remain
in
attica
when
he
heard
this
message
before
he
was
informed
of
this
he
had
been
waiting
because
he
desired
to
know
the
news
from
the
athenians
as
to
what
they
were
about
to
do
and
he
had
not
been
injuring
or
laying
waste
the
land
of
attica
because
he
hoped
always
that
they
would
make
a
treaty
with
him
but
as
he
did
not
persuade
them
being
now
informed
of
everything
he
began
to
retire
out
of
the
country
before
the
force
of
pausanias
arrived
at
the
isthmus
having
first
set
fire
to
athens
and
cast
down
and
destroyed
whatever
was
left
standing
of
the
walls
houses
or
temples
now
he
marched
away
for
this
cause
namely
first
because
attica
was
not
a
land
where
horsemen
could
act
freely
and
also
because
if
he
should
be
defeated
in
a
battle
in
attica
there
was
no
way
of
retreat
except
by
a
narrow
pass
so
that
a
few
men
could
stop
them
he
intended
therefore
to
retreat
to
thebes
and
engage
battle
near
to
a
friendly
city
and
to
a
country
where
horsemen
could
act
freely
mardonios
then
was
retiring
out
of
the
way
and
when
he
was
already
upon
a
road
a
message
came
to
him
saying
that
another
body
of
troops
in
advance
of
the
rest
had
come
to
megara
consisting
of
a
thousand
lacedemonians
being
thus
informed
he
took
counsel
with
himself
desiring
if
possible
first
to
capture
these
therefore
he
turned
back
and
proceeded
to
lead
his
army
towards
megara
and
the
cavalry
going
in
advance
of
the
rest
overran
the
megaran
land
this
was
the
furthest
land
in
europe
towards
the
to
which
this
persian
army
after
this
a
message
came
to
mardonios
that
the
hellenes
were
assembled
at
the
isthmus
therefore
he
marched
back
by
dekeleia
for
the
chiefs
of
boeotia
had
sent
for
those
of
the
asopians
who
dwelt
near
the
line
of
march
and
these
were
his
guides
along
the
road
to
sphendaleis
and
thence
to
tanagra
so
having
encamped
for
the
night
at
tanagra
and
on
the
next
day
having
directed
his
march
to
scolos
he
was
within
the
land
of
the
thebans
then
he
proceeded
to
cut
down
the
trees
in
the
lands
of
the
thebans
although
they
were
on
the
side
of
the
medes
moved
not
at
all
by
enmity
to
them
but
pressed
by
urgent
necessity
both
to
make
a
defence
for
his
camp
and
also
he
was
making
it
for
a
refuge
in
case
that
when
he
engaged
battle
things
should
not
turn
out
for
him
as
he
desired
now
the
encampment
of
his
army
extended
from
erythrai
along
by
hysiai
and
reached
the
river
asopos
he
was
not
however
making
the
wall
to
extend
so
far
as
this
but
with
each
face
measuring
somewhere
about
ten
furlongs
while
the
barbarians
were
engaged
upon
this
work
attaginos
the
son
of
phyrnon
a
theban
having
made
magnificent
preparations
invited
to
an
entertainment
mardonios
himself
and
fifty
of
the
persians
who
were
of
most
account
and
these
being
invited
came
and
the
dinner
was
given
at
thebes
now
this
which
follows
i
heard
from
thersander
an
orchomenian
and
a
man
of
very
high
repute
in
orchomenos
this
thersander
said
that
he
too
was
invited
by
attaginos
to
this
dinner
and
there
were
invited
also
fifty
men
of
the
thebans
and
their
host
did
not
place
them
to
recline
separately
each
nation
by
themselves
but
a
persian
and
a
theban
upon
every
couch
then
when
dinner
was
over
as
they
were
drinking
pledges
to
one
another
the
persian
who
shared
a
couch
with
him
speaking
in
the
hellenic
tongue
asked
him
of
what
place
he
was
and
he
answered
that
he
was
of
orchomenos
the
other
said
since
now
thou
hast
become
my
and
the
sharer
of
my
libation
i
desire
to
leave
behind
with
thee
a
memorial
of
my
opinion
in
order
that
thou
thyself
also
mayest
know
beforehand
and
be
able
to
take
such
counsels
for
thyself
as
may
be
profitable
dost
thou
see
these
persians
who
are
feasting
here
and
the
army
which
we
left
behind
encamped
upon
the
river
of
all
these
when
a
little
time
has
gone
by
thou
shalt
see
but
very
few
surviving
while
the
persian
said
these
words
he
shed
many
tears
as
thersander
reported
and
he
marvelling
at
his
speech
said
to
him
surely
then
it
is
right
to
tell
mardonios
and
to
those
of
the
persians
who
after
him
are
held
in
regard
he
upon
this
said
friend
that
which
is
destined
to
come
from
god
it
is
impossible
for
a
man
to
avert
for
no
man
is
willing
to
follow
counsel
even
when
one
speaks
that
which
is
reasonable
and
these
things
which
i
say
many
of
us
persians
know
well
yet
we
go
with
the
rest
being
bound
in
the
bonds
of
necessity
and
the
most
hateful
grief
of
all
human
griefs
is
this
to
have
knowledge
of
the
truth
but
no
power
over
the
event
these
things
i
heard
from
thersander
of
orchomenos
and
in
addition
to
them
this
also
namely
that
he
told
them
to
various
persons
forthwith
before
the
battle
took
place
at
plataia
mardonios
then
being
encamped
in
boeotia
the
rest
of
the
hellenes
who
lived
in
these
parts
and
took
the
side
of
the
medes
were
all
supplying
troops
and
had
joined
in
the
invasion
of
attica
but
the
phokians
alone
had
not
joined
in
the
invasion
phokians
i
say
for
these
too
were
now
actively
taking
the
side
of
the
medes
not
of
their
own
will
however
but
by
compulsion
not
many
days
however
after
the
arrival
of
mardonios
at
thebes
there
came
of
them
a
thousand
hoplites
and
their
leader
was
harmokydes
the
man
who
was
of
most
repute
among
their
citizens
when
these
too
came
to
thebes
mardonios
sent
horsemen
and
bade
the
phokians
take
up
their
position
by
themselves
in
the
plain
after
they
had
so
done
forthwith
the
whole
cavalry
appeared
and
upon
this
there
went
a
rumour
through
the
army
of
hellenes
which
was
with
the
medes
that
the
cavalry
was
about
to
shoot
them
down
with
javelins
and
this
same
report
went
through
the
phokians
themselves
also
then
their
commander
harmokydes
exhorted
them
speaking
as
follows
phokians
it
is
manifest
that
these
men
are
meaning
to
deliver
us
to
a
death
which
we
may
plainly
foresee
because
we
have
been
falsely
accused
by
the
thessalians
as
i
conjecture
now
therefore
it
is
right
that
every
one
of
you
prove
himself
a
good
man
for
it
is
better
to
bring
our
lives
to
an
end
doing
deeds
of
valour
and
defending
ourselves
than
to
be
destroyed
by
a
dishonourable
death
offering
ourselves
for
the
slaughter
let
each
man
of
them
learn
that
they
are
barbarians
and
that
we
against
whom
they
contrived
murder
are
while
he
was
thus
exhorting
them
the
horsemen
having
encompassed
them
round
were
riding
towards
them
as
if
to
destroy
them
and
they
were
already
aiming
their
missiles
as
if
about
to
discharge
them
nay
some
perhaps
did
discharge
them
and
meanwhile
the
phokians
stood
facing
them
gathered
together
and
with
their
ranks
closed
as
much
as
possible
every
way
then
the
horsemen
turned
and
rode
away
back
now
i
am
not
able
to
say
for
certain
whether
they
came
to
destroy
the
phokians
at
the
request
of
the
thessalians
and
then
when
they
saw
them
turn
to
defence
they
feared
lest
they
also
might
suffer
some
loss
and
therefore
rode
away
back
for
so
mardonios
had
commanded
them
or
whether
on
the
other
hand
he
desired
to
make
trial
of
them
and
to
see
if
they
had
in
them
any
warlike
spirit
then
when
the
horsemen
had
ridden
away
back
mardonios
sent
a
herald
and
spoke
to
them
as
follows
be
of
good
courage
phokians
for
ye
proved
yourselves
good
men
and
not
as
i
was
informed
now
therefore
carry
on
this
way
with
zeal
for
ye
will
not
surpass
in
benefits
either
myself
or
the
king
thus
far
it
happened
as
regards
the
phokians
when
the
lacedemonians
came
to
the
isthmus
they
encamped
upon
it
and
hearing
this
the
rest
of
the
peloponnesians
who
favoured
the
better
cause
and
some
also
because
they
saw
the
spartans
going
out
did
not
think
it
right
to
be
behind
the
lacedemonians
in
their
going
forth
so
from
the
isthmus
when
the
sacrifices
had
proved
favourable
they
marched
all
together
and
came
to
eleusis
and
having
performed
sacrifices
there
also
when
the
signs
were
favourable
they
marched
onwards
and
the
athenians
together
with
them
who
had
passed
over
from
salamis
and
had
joined
them
at
eleusis
and
then
they
had
come
to
erythrai
in
boeotia
then
they
learnt
that
the
barbarians
were
encamping
on
the
asopos
and
having
perceived
this
they
ranged
themselves
over
against
them
on
the
lower
slopes
of
then
mardonios
as
the
hellenes
did
not
descend
into
the
plain
sent
towards
them
all
his
cavalry
of
which
the
commander
was
masistios
by
the
hellenes
called
makistios
a
man
of
reputation
among
the
persians
who
had
a
nesaian
horse
with
a
bridle
of
gold
and
in
other
respects
finely
caparisoned
so
when
the
horsemen
had
ridden
up
to
the
hellenes
they
attacked
them
by
squadrons
and
attacking
they
did
them
much
mischief
and
moreover
in
contempt
they
called
them
now
it
happened
by
chance
that
the
megarians
were
posted
in
the
place
which
was
the
most
assailable
of
the
whole
position
and
to
which
the
cavalry
could
best
approach
so
as
the
cavalry
were
making
their
attacks
the
megarians
being
hard
pressed
sent
a
herald
to
the
commanders
of
the
hellenes
and
the
herald
having
come
spoke
these
words
the
megarians
say
o
allies
are
not
able
by
ourselves
to
sustain
the
attacks
of
the
persian
cavalry
keeping
this
position
where
we
took
post
at
the
first
nay
even
hitherto
by
endurance
and
valour
alone
have
we
held
out
against
them
hard
pressed
as
we
are
and
now
unless
ye
shall
send
some
others
to
take
up
our
position
in
succession
to
us
know
that
we
shall
leave
the
position
in
which
we
now
are
the
herald
brought
report
to
them
thus
and
upon
this
pausanias
made
trial
of
the
hellenes
whether
any
others
would
voluntarily
offer
to
go
to
this
place
and
post
themselves
there
in
succession
to
the
megarians
and
when
the
rest
were
not
desirous
to
go
the
athenians
undertook
the
task
and
of
the
athenians
those
three
hundred
picked
men
of
whom
olympidoros
the
son
of
lampon
was
captain
these
they
were
who
undertook
the
task
and
were
posted
at
erythrai
in
advance
of
the
other
hellenes
who
ere
there
present
having
chosen
to
go
with
them
the
also
for
some
time
then
they
fought
and
at
last
an
end
was
set
to
the
fighting
in
the
following
manner
the
cavalry
was
attacking
by
squadrons
the
horse
of
masistios
going
in
advance
of
the
rest
was
struck
in
the
side
by
an
arrow
and
feeling
pain
he
reared
upright
and
threw
masistios
off
and
when
he
had
fallen
the
athenians
forthwith
pressed
upon
him
and
his
horse
they
took
and
himself
as
he
made
resistance
they
slew
though
at
first
they
could
not
for
his
equipment
was
of
this
kind
wore
a
cuirass
of
gold
scales
underneath
and
over
the
cuirass
he
had
put
on
a
crimson
tunic
so
as
they
struck
upon
the
cuirass
they
could
effect
nothing
until
some
one
perceiving
what
the
matter
was
thrust
into
his
eye
then
at
length
he
fell
and
died
and
by
some
means
the
other
men
of
the
cavalry
had
not
observed
this
take
place
for
they
neither
saw
him
when
he
had
fallen
from
his
horse
nor
when
he
was
being
slain
and
while
the
retreat
and
the
turn
were
being
made
they
did
not
perceive
that
which
was
happening
but
when
they
had
stopped
their
horses
then
at
once
they
missed
him
since
there
was
no
one
to
command
them
and
when
they
perceived
what
had
happened
they
passed
the
word
to
one
another
and
all
rode
together
that
they
might
if
possible
recover
the
the
athenians
upon
that
seeing
that
the
cavalry
were
riding
to
attack
them
no
longer
by
squadrons
but
all
together
shouted
to
the
rest
of
the
army
to
help
them
then
while
the
whole
number
of
those
on
foot
were
coming
to
their
help
there
arose
a
sharp
fight
for
the
body
and
so
long
as
the
three
hundred
were
alone
they
had
much
the
worse
and
were
about
to
abandon
the
body
but
when
the
mass
of
the
army
came
to
their
help
then
the
horsemen
no
longer
sustained
the
fight
nor
did
they
succeed
in
recovering
the
body
and
besides
him
they
lost
others
of
their
number
also
then
they
drew
off
about
two
furlongs
away
and
deliberated
what
they
should
do
and
it
seemed
good
to
them
as
they
had
no
commander
to
ride
back
to
when
the
cavalry
arrived
at
the
camp
the
whole
army
and
also
mardonios
made
great
mourning
for
masistios
cutting
off
their
own
hair
and
that
of
their
horses
and
and
giving
way
to
lamentation
without
stint
for
all
boeotia
was
filled
with
the
sound
of
it
because
one
had
perished
who
after
mardonios
was
of
the
most
account
with
the
persians
and
with
the
the
barbarians
then
were
paying
honours
in
their
own
manner
to
masistios
slain
but
the
hellenes
when
they
had
sustained
the
attack
of
the
cavalry
and
having
sustained
it
had
driven
them
back
were
much
more
encouraged
and
first
they
put
the
dead
body
in
a
cart
and
conveyed
it
along
their
ranks
and
the
body
was
a
sight
worth
seeing
for
its
size
and
beauty
wherefore
also
the
men
left
their
places
in
the
ranks
and
went
one
after
the
other
to
gaze
upon
masistios
after
this
they
resolved
to
come
down
further
towards
plataia
for
the
region
of
plataia
was
seen
to
be
much
more
convenient
for
them
to
encamp
in
than
that
of
erythrai
both
for
other
reasons
and
because
it
is
better
watered
to
this
region
then
and
to
the
spring
gargaphia
which
is
in
this
region
they
resolved
that
they
must
come
and
encamp
in
their
several
posts
so
they
took
up
their
arms
and
went
by
the
lower
slopes
of
kithairon
past
hysiai
to
the
plataian
land
and
having
there
arrived
they
posted
themselves
according
to
their
several
nations
near
the
spring
gargaphia
and
the
sacred
enclosure
of
androcrates
the
hero
over
low
hills
or
level
ground
then
in
the
arranging
of
the
several
posts
there
arose
a
contention
of
much
argument
between
the
tegeans
and
the
athenians
for
they
each
claimed
to
occupy
the
other
wing
of
the
army
themselves
alleging
deeds
both
new
and
old
the
tegeans
on
the
one
hand
said
as
follows
we
have
been
always
judged
worthy
of
this
post
by
the
whole
body
of
allies
in
all
the
common
expeditions
which
the
peloponnesians
have
made
before
this
whether
in
old
times
or
but
lately
ever
since
that
time
when
the
sons
of
heracles
endeavoured
after
the
death
of
eurystheus
to
return
to
the
peloponnese
this
honour
we
gained
at
that
time
by
reason
of
the
following
event
with
the
achaians
and
the
ionians
who
were
then
in
peloponnesus
we
had
come
out
to
the
isthmus
to
give
assistance
and
were
encamped
opposite
those
who
desired
to
return
then
it
is
said
that
hyllos
made
a
speech
saying
that
it
was
not
right
that
the
one
army
should
risk
its
safety
by
engaging
battle
with
the
other
and
urging
that
that
man
of
the
army
of
the
peloponnesians
whom
they
should
judge
to
be
the
best
of
them
should
fight
in
single
combat
with
himself
on
terms
concerted
between
them
the
peloponnesians
then
resolved
that
this
should
be
done
and
they
made
oath
with
one
another
on
this
condition
if
hyllos
should
conquer
the
leader
of
the
peloponnesians
then
the
sons
of
heracles
should
return
to
their
father
heritage
but
he
should
be
conquered
then
on
the
other
hand
the
sons
of
heracles
should
depart
and
lead
away
their
army
and
not
within
a
hundred
years
attempt
to
return
to
the
peloponnese
there
was
selected
then
of
all
the
allies
he
himself
making
a
voluntary
offer
echemos
the
son
of
aëropos
the
son
of
phegeus
who
was
our
commander
and
king
and
he
fought
a
single
combat
and
slew
hyllos
by
reason
of
this
deed
we
obtained
among
the
peloponnesians
of
that
time
besides
many
other
great
privileges
which
we
still
possess
this
also
of
always
leading
the
other
wing
of
the
army
when
a
common
expedition
is
made
to
you
lacedemonians
we
make
no
opposition
but
we
give
you
freedom
of
choice
and
allow
you
to
command
whichever
wing
ye
desire
but
of
the
other
we
say
that
it
belongs
to
us
to
be
the
leaders
as
in
former
time
and
apart
from
this
deed
which
has
been
related
we
are
more
worthy
than
the
athenians
to
have
this
post
for
in
many
glorious
contests
have
we
contended
against
you
o
spartans
and
in
many
also
against
others
therefore
it
is
just
that
we
have
the
other
wing
rather
than
the
athenians
for
they
have
not
achieved
deeds
such
as
ours
either
new
or
thus
they
spoke
and
the
athenians
replied
as
follows
though
we
know
that
this
gathering
was
assembled
for
battle
with
the
barbarian
and
not
for
speech
yet
since
the
tegean
has
proposed
to
us
as
a
task
to
speak
of
things
both
old
and
new
the
deeds
of
merit
namely
which
by
each
of
our
two
nations
have
been
achieved
in
all
time
it
is
necessary
for
us
to
point
out
to
you
whence
it
comes
that
to
us
who
have
been
brave
men
always
it
belongs
as
a
heritage
rather
than
to
the
arcadians
to
have
the
chief
place
first
as
to
the
sons
of
heracles
whose
leader
they
say
that
they
slew
at
the
isthmus
these
in
the
former
time
when
they
were
driven
away
by
all
the
hellenes
to
whom
they
came
flying
from
slavery
under
those
of
mykene
we
alone
received
and
joining
with
them
we
subdued
the
insolence
of
eurystheus
having
conquered
in
fight
those
who
then
dwelt
in
peloponnesus
again
when
the
argives
who
with
polyneikes
marched
against
thebes
had
been
slain
and
were
lying
unburied
we
declare
that
we
marched
an
army
against
the
cadmeians
and
recovered
the
dead
bodies
and
gave
them
burial
in
our
own
land
at
eleusis
we
have
moreover
another
glorious
deed
performed
against
the
amazons
who
invaded
once
the
attic
land
coming
from
the
river
thermodon
and
in
the
toils
of
troy
we
were
not
inferior
to
any
but
it
is
of
no
profit
to
make
mention
of
these
things
for
on
the
one
hand
though
we
were
brave
men
in
those
times
we
might
now
have
become
worthless
and
on
the
other
hand
even
though
we
were
then
worthless
yet
now
we
might
be
better
let
it
suffice
therefore
about
ancient
deeds
but
if
by
us
no
other
deed
has
been
displayed
as
many
there
have
been
and
glorious
not
less
than
by
any
other
people
of
the
hellenes
yet
even
by
reason
of
the
deed
wrought
at
marathon
alone
we
are
worthy
to
have
this
privilege
and
others
besides
this
seeing
that
we
alone
of
all
the
hellenes
fought
in
single
combat
with
the
persian
and
having
undertaken
so
great
a
deed
we
overcame
and
conquered
nations
are
we
not
worthy
then
to
have
this
post
by
reason
of
that
deed
alone
however
since
at
such
a
time
as
this
it
is
not
fitting
to
contend
for
post
we
are
ready
to
follow
your
saying
o
lacedemonians
as
to
where
ye
think
it
most
convenient
that
we
should
stand
and
opposite
to
whom
for
wheresoever
we
are
posted
we
shall
endeavour
to
be
brave
men
prescribe
to
us
therefore
and
we
shall
obey
they
made
answer
thus
and
the
whole
body
of
the
lacedemonians
shouted
aloud
that
the
athenians
were
more
worthy
to
occupy
the
wing
than
the
arcadians
thus
the
athenians
obtained
the
wing
and
overcame
the
tegeans
after
this
the
hellenes
were
ranged
as
follows
both
those
of
them
who
came
in
continually
afterwards
and
those
who
had
come
at
the
first
the
right
wing
was
held
by
ten
thousand
lacedemonians
and
of
these
the
five
thousand
who
were
spartans
were
attended
by
thousand
helots
serving
as
troops
seven
of
them
appointed
for
each
man
to
stand
next
to
themselves
the
spartans
chose
the
tegeans
both
to
do
them
honour
and
also
because
of
their
valour
and
of
these
there
were
one
thousand
five
hundred
hoplites
after
these
were
stationed
five
thousand
corinthians
and
they
had
obtained
permission
from
pausanias
that
the
three
hundred
who
were
present
of
the
men
of
potidaia
in
pallene
should
stand
by
their
side
next
to
these
were
stationed
six
hundred
arcadians
of
orchomenos
and
to
these
three
thousand
sikyonians
next
after
these
were
eight
hundred
epidaurians
by
the
side
of
these
were
ranged
a
thousand
troizenians
next
to
the
troizenians
two
hundred
lepreates
next
to
these
four
hundred
of
the
men
of
mikene
and
tiryns
and
then
a
thousand
phliasians
by
the
side
of
these
stood
three
hundred
hermionians
and
next
to
the
hermionians
were
stationed
six
hundred
eretrians
and
styrians
next
to
these
four
hundred
chalkidians
and
to
these
five
hundred
men
of
amprakia
after
these
stood
eight
hundred
leucadians
and
anactorians
and
next
to
them
two
hundred
from
pale
in

after
these
were
ranged
five
hundred
eginetans
by
their
side
three
thousand
megarians
and
next
to
these
six
hundred
plataians
last
or
if
you
will
first
were
ranged
the
athenians
occupying
the
left
wing
eight
thousand
in
number
and
the
commander
of
them
was
aristeides
the
son
of
these
all
excepting
those
who
were
appointed
to
attend
the
spartans
seven
for
each
man
were
hoplites
being
in
number
altogether
three
myriads
eight
thousand
and
seven
hundred
this
was
the
whole
number
of
hoplites
who
were
assembled
against
the
barbarian
and
the
number
of
the
was
as
follows
the
spartan
division
thousand
men
reckoning
at
the
rate
of
seven
for
each
man
and
of
these
every
one
was
equipped
for
fighting
and
the
troops
of
the
rest
of
the
lacedemonians
and
of
the
other
hellenes
being
about
one
for
each
man
amounted
to
thousand
five
of
the
fighting
men
the
whole
number
then
was
six
myriads
nine
thousand
and
five
hundred
and
of
the
whole
hellenic
force
which
assembled
at
plataia
the
number
including
both
the
hoplites
and
the
fighting
men
was
eleven
myriads
all
but
one
thousand
eight
hundred
men
and
with
the
thespians
who
were
present
the
number
of
eleven
myriads
was
fully
made
up
for
there
were
present
also
in
the
army
those
of
the
thespians
who
survived
being
in
number
about
one
thousand
eight
hundred
and
these
too
were
without
heavy
arms
these
then
having
been
ranged
in
order
were
encamped
on
the
river
asopos
meanwhile
the
barbarians
with
mardonios
when
they
had
sufficiently
mourned
for
masistios
being
informed
that
the
hellenes
were
at
plataia
came
themselves
also
to
that
part
of
the
asopos
which
flows
there
and
having
arrived
there
they
were
ranged
against
the
enemy
by
mardonios
thus
the
lacedemonians
he
stationed
the
persians
and
since
the
persians
were
much
superior
in
numbers
they
were
arrayed
in
deeper
ranks
than
those
and
notwithstanding
this
they
extended
in
front
of
the
tegeans
also
and
he
ranged
them
in
this
manner
the
strongest
part
of
that
body
he
selected
from
the
rest
and
stationed
it
opposite
to
the
lacedemonians
but
the
weaker
part
he
ranged
by
their
side
opposite
to
the
tegeans
this
he
did
on
the
information
and
suggestion
of
the
thebans
then
next
to
the
persians
he
ranged
the
medes
and
these
extended
in
front
of
the
corinthians
potidaians
orchomenians
and
sikyonians
next
to
the
medes
he
ranged
the
bactrians
and
these
extended
in
front
of
the
epidaurians
troizenians
lepreates
tirynthians
mykenians
and
phliasians
after
the
bactrians
he
stationed
the
indians
and
these
extended
in
front
of
the
hermionians
eretrians
styrians
and
chalkidians
next
to
the
indians
he
ranged
the
sacans
who
extended
in
front
of
the
men
of
amprakia
the
anactorians
leucadians
palians
and
eginetans
next
to
the
sacans
and
opposite
to
the
athenians
plataians
and
megarians
he
ranged
the
boeotians
locrians
malians
thessalians
and
the
thousand
men
of
the
phokians
for
not
all
the
phokians
had
taken
the
side
of
the
medes
but
some
of
them
were
even
supporting
the
cause
of
the
hellenes
being
shut
up
in
parnassos
and
setting
out
from
thence
they
plundered
from
the
army
of
mardonios
and
from
those
of
the
hellenes
who
were
with
him
he
ranged
the
macedonians
also
and
those
who
dwell
about
the
borders
of
thessaly
opposite
to
the
these
which
have
been
named
were
the
greatest
of
the
nations
who
were
arrayed
in
order
by
mardonios
those
i
mean
which
were
the
most
renowned
and
of
greatest
consideration
but
there
were
in
his
army
also
men
of
several
other
nations
mingled
together
of
the
phrygians
thracians
mysians
paionians
and
the
rest
and
among
them
also
some
ethiopians
and
of
the
egyptians
those
called
hermotybians
and
calasirians
carrying
knives
who
of
all
the
egyptians
are
the
only
warriors
these
men
while
he
was
yet
at
phaleron
he
had
caused
to
disembark
from
the
ships
in
which
they
served
as
for
the
egyptians
had
not
been
appointed
to
serve
in
the
which
came
with
xerxes
to
athens
of
the
barbarians
then
there
were
thirty
myriads
as
has
been
declared
before
but
of
the
hellenes
who
were
allies
of
mardonios
no
man
knows
what
the
number
was
for
they
were
not
numbered
but
by
conjecture
i
judge
that
these
were
assembled
to
the
number
of
five
myriads
these
who
were
placed
in
array
side
by
side
were
on
foot
and
the
cavalry
was
ranged
apart
from
them
in
a
separate
body
when
all
had
been
drawn
up
by
nations
and
by
divisions
then
on
the
next
day
they
offered
sacrifice
on
both
sides
for
the
hellenes
tisamenos
the
son
of
antiochos
was
he
who
offered
sacrifice
for
he
it
was
who
accompanied
this
army
as
diviner
this
man
the
lacedemonians
had
made
to
be
one
of
their
own
people
being
an
eleian
and
of
the
race
of
the
iamidai
for
when
tisamenos
was
seeking
divination
at
delphi
concerning
issue
the
pythian
prophetess
made
answer
to
him
that
he
should
win
five
of
the
greatest
contests
he
accordingly
missing
the
meaning
of
the
oracle
began
to
attend
to
athletic
games
supposing
that
he
should
win
contests
of
athletics
and
he
practised
for
the
five
contests
and
came
within
one
fall
of
winning
a
victory
at
the
olympic
games
being
set
to
contend
with
hieronymos
of
andros
the
lacedemonians
however
perceived
that
the
oracle
given
to
tisamenos
had
reference
not
to
athletic
but
to
martial
contests
and
they
endeavoured
to
persuade
tisamenos
by
payment
of
money
and
to
make
him
a
leader
in
their
wars
together
with
the
kings
of
the
race
of
heracles
he
then
seeing
that
the
spartans
set
much
store
on
gaining
him
over
as
a
friend
having
perceived
this
i
say
he
raised
his
price
and
signified
to
them
that
he
would
do
as
they
desired
if
they
would
make
him
a
citizen
of
their
state
and
give
him
full
rights
but
for
no
other
payment
the
spartans
at
first
when
they
heard
this
displayed
indignation
and
altogether
gave
up
their
request
but
at
last
when
great
terror
was
hanging
over
them
of
this
persian
armament
they
gave
way
and
consented
he
then
perceiving
that
they
had
changed
their
minds
said
that
he
could
not
now
be
satisfied
even
so
nor
with
these
terms
alone
but
it
was
necessary
that
his
brother
hegias
also
should
be
made
a
spartan
citizen
on
the
same
terms
as
he
himself
became
by
saying
this
he
followed
the
example
of
melampus
in
his
request
if
one
may
compare
royal
power
with
mere
citizenship
for
melampus
on
his
part
when
the
women
in
argos
had
been
seized
by
madness
and
the
argives
endeavoured
to
hire
him
to
come
from
pylos
and
to
cause
their
women
to
cease
from
the
malady
proposed
as
payment
for
himself
the
half
of
the
royal
power
and
the
argives
did
not
suffer
this
but
departed
and
afterwards
when
more
of
their
women
became
mad
at
length
they
accepted
that
which
melampus
had
proposed
and
went
to
offer
him
this
but
he
then
seeing
that
they
had
changed
their
minds
increased
his
demand
and
said
that
he
would
not
do
that
which
they
desired
unless
they
gave
to
his
brother
bias
also
the
third
share
in
the
royal
power
and
the
argives
being
driven
into
straits
consented
to
this
also
just
so
the
spartans
also
being
very
much
in
need
of
tisamenos
agreed
with
him
on
any
terms
which
he
desired
and
when
the
spartans
had
agreed
to
this
demand
also
then
tisamenos
the
eleian
having
become
a
spartan
had
part
with
them
in
winning
five
of
the
greatest
contests
as
their
diviner
and
these
were
the
only
men
who
ever
were
made
of
the
spartans
now
the
five
contests
were
these
one
and
the
first
of
them
was
this
at
plataia
and
after
this
the
contest
at
tegea
which
took
place
with
the
tegeans
and
the
argives
then
that
at
dipaieis
against
all
the
arcadians
except
the
mantineians
after
that
the
contest
with
the
messenians
at
ithome
and
last
of
all
that
which
took
place
at
tanagra
against
the
athenians
and
argives
this
i
say
was
accomplished
last
of
the
five
contests
this
tisamenos
was
acting
now
as
diviner
for
the
hellenes
in
the
plataian
land
being
brought
by
the
spartans
now
to
the
hellenes
the
sacrifices
were
of
good
omen
if
they
defended
themselves
only
but
not
if
they
crossed
the
asopos
and
began
a
battle
and
mardonios
too
who
was
eager
to
begin
a
battle
found
the
sacrifices
not
favourable
to
this
design
but
they
were
of
good
omen
to
him
also
if
he
defended
himself
only
for
he
too
used
the
hellenic
manner
of
sacrifice
having
as
diviner
hegesistratos
an
eleian
and
the
most
famous
of
the
telliadai
whom
before
these
events
the
spartans
had
taken
and
bound
in
order
to
put
him
to
death
because
they
had
suffered
much
mischief
from
him
he
then
being
in
this
evil
case
seeing
that
he
was
running
a
course
for
his
life
and
was
likely
moreover
to
suffer
much
torment
before
his
death
had
done
a
deed
such
as
may
hardly
be
believed
being
made
fast
on
a
block
bound
with
iron
he
obtained
an
iron
tool
which
in
some
way
had
been
brought
in
and
contrived
forthwith
a
deed
the
most
courageous
of
any
that
we
know
for
having
first
calculated
how
the
remaining
portion
of
his
foot
might
be
got
out
of
the
block
he
cut
away
the
flat
of
his
own
foot
and
after
that
since
he
was
guarded
still
by
warders
he
broke
through
the
wall
and
so
ran
away
to
tegea
travelling
during
the
nights
and
in
the
daytime
entering
a
wood
and
resting
there
so
that
though
the
lacedemonians
searched
for
him
in
full
force
he
arrived
at
tegea
on
the
third
night
and
the
lacedemonians
were
possessed
by
great
wonder
both
at
his
courage
when
they
saw
the
piece
of
the
foot
that
was
cut
off
lying
there
and
also
because
they
were
not
able
to
find
him
so
he
at
that
time
having
thus
escaped
them
took
refuge
at
tegea
which
then
was
not
friendly
with
the
lacedemonians
and
when
he
was
healed
and
had
procured
for
himself
a
wooden
foot
he
became
an
open
enemy
of
the
lacedemonians
however
in
the
end
the
enmity
into
which
he
had
fallen
with
the
lacedemonians
was
not
to
his
advantage
for
he
was
caught
by
them
while
practising
divination
in
zakynthos
and
was
put
to
death
however
the
death
of
hegesistratos
took
place
later
than
the
events
at
plataia
and
he
was
now
at
the
asopos
having
been
hired
by
mardonions
for
no
mean
sum
sacrificing
and
displaying
zeal
for
his
cause
both
on
account
of
his
enmity
with
the
lacedemonians
and
on
account
of
the
gain
which
he
got
but
as
the
sacrifices
were
not
favourable
for
a
battle
either
for
the
persians
themselves
or
for
those
hellenes
who
were
with
them
for
these
also
had
a
diviner
for
themselves
hippomachos
a
leucadian
and
as
the
hellenes
had
men
constantly
flowing
in
and
were
becoming
more
in
number
timagenides
the
son
of
herpys
a
theban
counselled
mardonios
to
set
a
guard
on
the
pass
of
kithairon
saying
that
the
hellenes
were
constantly
flowing
in
every
day
and
that
he
would
thus
cut
off
large
eight
days
had
now
passed
while
they
had
been
sitting
opposite
to
one
another
when
he
gave
this
counsel
to
mardonios
and
mardonios
perceiving
that
the
advice
was
good
sent
the
cavalry
when
night
came
on
to
the
pass
of
kithairon
leading
towards
plataia
which
the
boeotians
call
the
three
heads
and
the
athenians
the
oak
heads
having
been
thus
sent
the
cavalry
did
not
come
without
effect
for
they
caught
five
hundred
coming
out
into
the
plain
which
were
bearing
provisions
from
peloponnesus
to
the
army
and
also
the
men
who
accompanied
the
carts
and
having
taken
this
prize
the
persians
proceeded
to
slaughter
them
without
sparing
either
beast
or
man
and
when
they
were
satiated
with
killing
they
surrounded
the
rest
and
drove
them
into
the
camp
to
mardonios
after
this
deed
they
spent
two
days
more
neither
side
wishing
to
begin
a
battle
for
the
barbarians
advanced
as
far
as
the
asopos
to
make
trial
of
the
hellenes
but
neither
side
would
cross
the
river
however
the
cavalry
of
mardonios
made
attacks
continually
and
did
damage
to
the
hellenes
for
the
thebans
being
very
strong
on
the
side
of
the
medes
carried
on
the
war
with
vigour
and
always
directed
them
up
to
the
moment
of
fighting
and
after
this
the
persians
and
medes
took
up
the
work
and
were
they
who
displayed
valour
in
their
turn
for
ten
days
then
nothing
more
was
done
than
this
but
when
the
eleventh
day
had
come
while
they
still
sat
opposite
to
one
another
at
plataia
the
hellenes
having
by
this
time
grown
much
more
numerous
and
mardonios
being
greatly
vexed
at
the
delay
of
action
then
mardonios
the
son
of
gobryas
and
artabazos
the
son
of
pharnakes
who
was
esteemed
by
xerxes
as
few
of
the
persians
were
besides
came
to
speech
with
one
another
and
as
they
conferred
the
opinions
they
expressed
were
these
of
artabazos
that
they
must
put
the
whole
army
in
motion
as
soon
as
possible
and
go
to
the
walls
of
the
thebans
whither
great
stores
of
corn
had
been
brought
in
for
them
and
fodder
for
their
beasts
and
that
they
should
settle
there
quietly
and
get
their
business
done
as
follows
had
he
said
great
quantities
of
gold
both
coined
and
uncoined
and
also
of
silver
and
of
and
these
he
advised
they
should
send
about
to
the
hellenes
without
stint
more
especially
to
those
of
the
hellenes
who
were
leaders
in
their
several
cities
and
these
he
said
would
speedily
deliver
up
their
freedom
and
he
advised
that
they
should
not
run
the
risk
of
a
battle
his
opinion
then
was
the
same
as
that
of
the
thebans
for
he
as
well
as
they
had
some
true
foresight
but
the
opinion
of
mardonios
was
more
vehement
and
more
obstinate
and
he
was
by
no
means
disposed
to
yield
for
he
said
that
he
thought
their
army
far
superior
to
that
of
the
hellenes
and
he
gave
as
his
opinion
that
they
should
engage
battle
as
quickly
as
possible
and
not
allow
them
to
assemble
in
still
greater
numbers
than
were
already
assembled
and
as
for
the
sacrifices
of
hegesistratos
they
should
leave
them
alone
and
not
endeavour
to
force
a
good
sign
but
follow
the
custom
of
the
persians
and
engage
when
he
so
expressed
his
judgment
none
opposed
him
and
thus
his
opinion
prevailed
for
he
and
not
artabazos
had
the
command
of
the
army
given
him
by
the
king
he
summoned
therefore
the
commanders
of
the
divisions
and
the
generals
of
those
hellenes
who
were
with
him
and
asked
whether
they
knew
of
any
oracle
regarding
the
persians
which
said
that
they
should
be
destroyed
in
hellas
and
when
those
summoned
to
council
were
silent
some
not
knowing
the
oracles
and
others
knowing
them
but
not
esteeming
it
safe
to
speak
mardonios
himself
said
since
then
ye
either
know
nothing
or
do
not
venture
to
speak
i
will
tell
you
since
i
know
very
well
there
is
an
oracle
saying
that
the
persians
are
destined
when
they
come
to
hellas
to
plunder
the
temple
at
delphi
and
having
plundered
it
to
perish
every
one
of
them
we
therefore
just
because
we
know
this
will
not
go
to
that
temple
nor
will
we
attempt
to
plunder
it
and
for
this
cause
we
shall
not
perish
so
many
of
you
therefore
as
chance
to
wish
well
to
the
persians
have
joy
so
far
as
regards
this
matter
and
be
assured
that
we
shall
overcome
the
hellenes
having
spoken
to
them
thus
he
next
commanded
to
prepare
everything
and
to
set
all
in
order
since
at
dawn
of
the
next
day
a
battle
would
be
fought
now
this
oracle
which
mardonios
said
referred
to
the
persians
i
know
for
my
part
was
composed
with
reference
with
the
illyrians
and
the
army
of
the
enchelians
and
not
with
reference
to
the
persians
at
all
however
the
oracle
which
was
composed
by
bakis
with
reference
to
this
battle
the
gathering
of
hellenes
together
and
cry
of
barbarian
voices
where
the
thermodon
flows
by
the
banks
of
grassy
asopos
here
very
many
shall
fall
ere
destiny
gave
them
to
perish
medes
in
fight
when
the
fatal
day
shall
approach
them
these
sayings
and
others
like
them
composed
by
musaios
i
know
had
reference
to
the
persians
now
the
river
thermodon
flows
between
tanagra
and
glisas
after
the
inquiry
about
the
oracles
and
the
exhortation
given
by
mardonios
night
came
on
and
the
guards
were
set
and
when
night
was
far
advanced
and
it
seemed
that
there
was
quiet
everywhere
in
the
camps
and
that
the
men
were
in
their
deepest
sleep
then
alexander
the
son
of
amyntas
commander
and
king
of
the
macedonians
rode
his
horse
up
to
the
of
the
athenians
and
requested
that
he
might
have
speech
with
their
generals
so
while
the
greater
number
of
the
guards
stayed
at
their
posts
some
ran
to
the
generals
and
when
they
reached
them
they
said
that
a
man
had
come
riding
on
a
horse
out
of
the
camp
of
the
medes
who
discovered
nothing
further
but
only
named
the
generals
and
said
that
he
desired
to
have
speech
with
having
heard
this
forthwith
they
accompanied
the
men
to
the
and
when
they
had
arrived
there
alexander
thus
spoke
to
them
athenians
i
lay
up
these
words
of
mine
as
a
trust
to
you
charging
you
to
keep
them
secret
and
tell
them
to
no
one
except
only
to
pausanias
lest
ye
bring
me
to
ruin
for
i
should
not
utter
them
if
i
did
not
care
greatly
for
the
general
safety
of
hellas
seeing
that
i
am
a
hellene
myself
by
original
descent
and
i
should
not
wish
to
see
hellas
enslaved
instead
of
free
i
say
then
that
mardonios
and
his
army
can
not
get
the
offerings
to
be
according
to
their
mind
for
otherwise
ye
would
long
ago
have
fought
now
however
he
has
resolved
to
let
the
offerings
alone
and
to
bring
on
a
battle
at
dawn
of
day
for
as
i
conjecture
he
fears
lest
ye
should
assemble
in
greater
numbers
therefore
prepare
yourselves
and
if
after
all
mardonios
should
put
off
the
battle
and
not
bring
it
on
stay
where
ye
are
and
hold
out
patiently
for
they
have
provisions
only
for
a
few
days
remaining
and
if
this
way
shall
have
its
issue
according
to
your
mind
then
each
one
of
you
ought
to
remember
me
also
concerning
liberation
since
i
have
done
for
the
sake
of
the
hellenes
so
hazardous
a
deed
by
reason
of
my
zeal
for
you
desiring
to
show
you
the
design
of
mardonios
in
order
that
the
barbarians
may
not
fall
upon
you
when
ye
are
not
as
yet
expecting
them
and
i
am
alexander
the
macedonian
thus
having
spoken
he
rode
away
back
to
the
camp
and
to
his
own
position
then
the
generals
of
the
athenians
came
to
the
right
wing
and
told
pausanias
that
which
they
had
heard
from
alexander
upon
this
saying
he
being
struck
with
fear
of
the
persians
spoke
as
follows
since
then
at
dawn
the
battle
comes
on
it
is
right
that
ye
athenians
should
take
your
stand
opposite
to
the
persians
and
we
opposite
to
the
boeotians
and
those
hellenes
who
are
now
posted
against
you
and
for
this
reason
namely
because
ye
are
acquainted
with
the
medes
and
with
their
manner
of
fighting
having
fought
with
them
at
marathon
whereas
we
have
had
no
experience
of
these
men
and
are
without
knowledge
of
them
for
not
one
of
the
spartans
has
made
trial
of
the
medes
in
fight
but
of
the
boeotians
and
thessalians
we
have
had
experience
it
is
right
therefore
that
ye
should
take
up
your
arms
and
come
to
this
wing
of
the
army
and
that
we
should
go
to
the
left
wing
in
answer
to
this
the
athenians
spoke
as
follows
to
ourselves
also
long
ago
at
the
very
first
when
we
saw
that
the
persians
were
being
ranged
opposite
to
you
it
occurred
to
us
to
say
these
very
things
which
ye
now
bring
forward
before
we
have
uttered
them
but
we
feared
lest
these
words
might
not
be
pleasing
to
you
since
however
ye
yourselves
have
made
mention
of
this
know
that
your
words
have
caused
us
pleasure
and
that
we
are
ready
to
do
this
which
ye
both
then
were
content
to
do
this
and
as
dawn
appeared
they
began
to
change
their
positions
with
one
another
and
the
boeotians
perceiving
that
which
was
being
done
reported
it
to
mardonios
who
when
he
heard
it
forthwith
himself
also
endeavoured
to
change
positions
bringing
the
persians
along
so
as
to
be
against
the
lacedemonians
and
when
pausanias
learnt
that
this
was
being
done
he
perceived
that
he
was
not
unobserved
and
he
led
the
spartans
back
again
to
the
right
wing
and
just
so
also
did
mardonios
upon
his
left
when
they
had
been
thus
brought
to
their
former
positions
mardonios
sent
a
herald
to
the
spartans
and
said
as
follows
lacedemonians
ye
are
said
forsooth
by
those
who
are
here
to
be
very
good
men
and
they
have
admiration
for
you
because
ye
do
not
flee
in
war
nor
leave
your
post
but
stay
there
and
either
destroy
your
enemies
or
perish
yourselves
in
this
however
as
it
now
appears
there
is
no
truth
for
before
we
engaged
battle
and
came
to
conflict
we
saw
you
already
flee
and
leave
your
station
desiring
to
make
the
trial
with
the
athenians
first
while
ye
ranged
yourselves
opposite
to
our
slaves
these
are
not
at
all
the
deeds
of
good
men
in
war
but
we
were
deceived
in
you
very
greatly
for
we
expected
by
reason
of
your
renown
that
ye
would
send
a
herald
to
us
challenging
us
and
desiring
to
fight
with
the
persians
alone
but
though
we
on
our
part
were
ready
to
do
this
we
did
not
find
that
ye
said
anything
of
this
kind
but
rather
that
ye
cowered
with
fear
now
therefore
since
ye
were
not
the
first
to
say
this
we
are
the
first
why
do
we
not
forthwith
fight
ye
on
behalf
of
the
hellenes
since
ye
have
the
reputation
of
being
the
best
and
we
on
behalf
of
the
barbarians
with
equal
numbers
on
both
sides
and
if
we
think
it
good
that
the
others
should
fight
also
then
let
them
fight
afterwards
and
if
on
the
other
hand
we
should
not
think
it
good
but
think
it
sufficient
that
we
alone
should
fight
then
let
us
fight
it
out
to
the
end
and
whichsoever
of
us
shall
be
the
victors
let
these
be
counted
as
victorious
with
their
whole
the
herald
having
thus
spoken
waited
for
some
time
and
then
as
no
one
made
him
any
answer
he
departed
and
went
back
and
having
returned
he
signified
to
mardonios
that
which
had
happened
to
him
mardonios
then
being
greatly
rejoiced
and
elated
by
his
empty
victory
sent
the
cavalry
to
attack
the
hellenes
and
when
the
horsemen
had
ridden
to
attack
them
they
did
damage
to
the
whole
army
of
the
hellenes
by
hurling
javelins
against
them
and
shooting
with
bows
being
mounted
archers
and
hard
therefore
to
fight
against
and
they
disturbed
and
choked
up
the
spring
gargaphia
from
which
the
whole
army
of
the
hellenes
was
drawing
its
water
now
the
lacedemonians
alone
were
posted
near
this
spring
and
it
was
at
some
distance
from
the
rest
of
the
hellenes
according
as
they
chanced
to
be
posted
while
the
asopos
was
near
at
hand
but
when
they
were
kept
away
from
the
asopos
then
they
used
to
go
backwards
and
forwards
to
this
spring
for
they
were
not
permitted
by
the
horsemen
and
archers
to
fetch
water
from
the
such
then
being
the
condition
of
things
the
generals
of
the
hellenes
since
the
army
had
been
cut
off
from
its
water
and
was
being
harassed
by
the
cavalry
assembled
to
consult
about
these
and
other
things
coming
to
pausanias
upon
the
right
wing
for
other
things
too
troubled
them
yet
more
than
these
of
which
we
have
spoken
since
they
no
longer
had
provisions
and
their
attendants
who
had
been
sent
to
peloponnese
for
the
purpose
of
getting
them
had
been
cut
off
by
the
cavalry
and
were
not
able
to
reach
the
it
was
resolved
then
by
the
generals
in
council
with
one
another
that
if
the
persians
put
off
the
battle
for
that
day
they
would
go
to
the
island
this
is
distant
ten
furlongs
from
the
asopos
and
the
spring
gargaphia
where
they
were
then
encamped
and
is
in
front
of
the
city
of
the
plataians
and
if
it
be
asked
how
there
can
be
an
island
on
the
mainland
thus
it
is
river
parts
in
two
above
as
it
flows
from
kithairon
down
to
the
plain
keeping
a
distance
of
about
three
furlongs
between
its
streams
and
after
that
it
joins
again
in
one
stream
and
the
name
of
it
is
oëroe
said
by
the
natives
of
the
country
to
be
the
daughter
of
asopos
to
this
place
of
which
i
speak
they
determined
to
remove
in
order
that
they
might
be
able
to
get
an
abundant
supply
of
water
and
that
the
cavalry
might
not
do
them
damage
as
now
when
they
were
right
opposite
and
they
proposed
to
remove
when
the
second
watch
of
the
night
should
have
come
so
that
the
persians
might
not
see
them
set
forth
and
harass
them
with
the
cavalry
pursuing
they
proposed
also
after
they
had
arrived
at
this
place
round
which
as
i
say
oëroe
the
daughter
of
asopos
flows
parting
into
two
streams
as
she
runs
from
kithairon
to
send
half
the
army
to
kithairon
during
this
same
night
in
order
to
take
up
their
attendants
who
had
gone
to
get
the
supplies
of
provisions
for
these
were
cut
off
from
them
in
kithairon
having
thus
resolved
during
the
whole
of
that
day
they
had
trouble
unceasingly
while
the
cavalry
pressed
upon
them
but
when
the
day
drew
to
a
close
and
the
attacks
of
the
cavalry
had
ceased
then
as
it
was
becoming
night
and
the
time
had
arrived
at
which
it
had
been
agreed
that
they
should
retire
from
their
place
the
greater
number
of
them
set
forth
and
began
to
retire
not
however
keeping
it
in
mind
to
go
to
the
place
which
had
been
agreed
upon
but
on
the
contrary
when
they
had
begun
to
move
they
readily
took
occasion
to
flee
from
the
cavalry
towards
the
city
of
the
plataians
and
in
their
flight
they
came
as
far
as
the
temple
of
hera
which
temple
is
in
front
of
the
city
of
the
plataians
at
a
distance
of
twenty
furlongs
from
the
spring
gargaphia
and
when
they
had
there
arrived
they
halted
in
front
of
the
temple
these
then
were
encamping
about
the
temple
of
hera
and
pausanias
seeing
that
they
were
retiring
from
the
camp
gave
the
word
to
the
lacedemonians
also
to
take
up
their
arms
and
go
after
the
others
who
were
preceding
them
supposing
that
these
were
going
to
the
place
to
which
they
had
agreed
to
go
then
when
all
the
other
commanders
were
ready
to
obey
pausanias
amompharetos
the
son
of
poliades
the
commander
of
the
pitanate
division
said
that
he
would
not
flee
from
the
strangers
nor
with
his
own
will
would
he
disgrace
sparta
and
he
expressed
wonder
at
seeing
that
which
was
being
done
not
having
been
present
at
the
former
discussion
and
pausanias
and
euryanax
were
greatly
disturbed
that
he
did
not
obey
them
and
still
more
that
they
should
be
compelled
to
leave
the
pitanate
division
behind
since
he
thus
refused
for
they
feared
that
if
they
should
leave
it
in
order
to
do
that
which
they
had
agreed
with
the
other
hellenes
both
amompharetos
himself
would
perish
being
left
behind
and
also
the
men
with
him
with
this
thought
they
kept
the
lacedemonian
force
from
moving
and
meanwhile
they
endeavoured
to
persuade
him
that
it
was
not
right
for
him
to
do
they
then
were
exhorting
amompharetos
who
had
been
left
behind
alone
of
the
lacedemonians
and
tegeans
and
meanwhile
the
athenians
were
keeping
themselves
quiet
in
the
place
where
they
had
been
posted
knowing
the
spirit
of
the
lacedemonians
that
they
were
apt
to
say
otherwise
than
they
really
meant
and
when
the
army
began
to
move
they
sent
a
horseman
from
their
own
body
to
see
whether
the
spartans
were
attempting
to
set
forth
or
whether
they
had
in
truth
no
design
at
all
to
retire
and
they
bade
him
ask
pausanias
what
they
ought
to
do
so
when
the
herald
came
to
the
lacedemonians
he
saw
that
they
were
still
in
their
place
and
that
the
chiefs
of
them
had
come
to
strife
with
one
another
for
when
euryanax
and
pausanias
both
exhorted
amompharetos
not
to
run
the
risk
of
remaining
behind
with
his
men
alone
of
all
the
lacedemonians
they
did
not
at
all
persuade
him
and
at
last
they
had
come
to
downright
strife
and
meanwhile
the
herald
of
the
athenians
had
arrived
and
was
standing
by
them
and
amompharetos
in
his
contention
took
a
piece
of
rock
in
both
his
hands
and
placed
it
at
the
feet
of
pausanias
saying
that
with
this
pebble
he
gave
his
vote
not
to
fly
from
the
strangers
meaning
the
barbarians
pausanias
then
calling
him
a
madman
and
one
who
was
not
in
his
right
senses
bade
tell
the
state
of
their
affairs
to
the
athenian
herald
who
was
asking
that
which
he
had
been
charged
to
ask
and
at
the
same
time
he
requested
the
athenians
to
come
towards
the
lacedemonians
and
to
do
in
regard
to
the
retreat
the
same
as
they
he
then
went
away
back
to
the
athenians
and
as
the
dawn
of
day
found
them
yet
disputing
with
one
another
pausanias
who
had
remained
still
throughout
all
this
time
gave
the
signal
and
led
away
all
the
rest
over
the
low
hills
supposing
that
amonpharetos
would
not
stay
behind
when
the
other
lacedemonians
departed
in
which
he
was
in
fact
right
and
with
them
also
went
the
tegeans
meanwhile
the
athenians
following
the
commands
which
were
given
them
were
going
in
the
direction
opposite
to
that
of
the
lacedemonians
for
these
were
clinging
to
the
hills
and
the
lower
slope
of
kithairon
from
fear
of
the
cavalry
while
the
athenians
were
marching
below
in
the
direction
of
the
as
for
amonpharetos
he
did
not
at
first
believe
that
pausanias
would
ever
venture
to
leave
him
and
his
men
behind
and
he
stuck
to
it
that
they
should
stay
there
and
not
leave
their
post
but
when
pausanias
and
his
troops
were
well
in
front
then
he
perceived
that
they
had
actually
left
him
behind
and
he
made
his
division
take
up
their
arms
and
led
them
slowly
towards
the
main
body
this
when
it
had
got
away
about
ten
furlongs
stayed
for
the
division
of
amompharetos
halting
at
the
river
moloeis
and
the
place
called
argiopion
where
also
there
stands
a
temple
of
the
eleusinian
demeter
and
it
stayed
there
for
this
reason
namely
in
order
that
of
amonpharetos
and
his
division
should
not
leave
the
place
where
they
had
been
posted
but
should
remain
there
it
might
be
able
to
come
back
to
their
assistance
so
amompharetos
and
his
men
were
coming
up
to
join
them
and
the
cavalry
also
of
the
barbarians
was
at
the
same
time
beginning
to
attack
them
in
full
force
for
the
horsemen
did
on
this
day
as
they
had
been
wont
to
do
every
day
and
seeing
the
place
vacant
in
which
the
hellenes
had
been
posted
on
the
former
days
they
rode
their
horses
on
continually
further
and
as
soon
as
they
came
up
with
them
they
began
to
attack
them
then
mardonios
when
he
was
informed
that
the
hellenes
had
departed
during
the
night
and
when
he
saw
their
place
deserted
called
thorax
of
larissa
and
his
brothers
eurypylos
and
thrasydeios
and
said
sons
of
aleuas
will
ye
yet
say
anything
now
that
ye
see
these
places
deserted
for
ye
who
dwell
near
them
were
wont
to
say
that
the
lacedemonians
did
not
fly
from
a
battle
but
were
men
unsurpassed
in
war
and
these
men
ye
not
only
saw
before
this
changing
from
their
post
but
now
we
all
of
us
see
that
they
have
run
away
during
the
past
night
and
by
this
they
showed
clearly
when
the
time
came
for
them
to
contend
in
battle
with
those
who
were
in
truth
the
best
of
all
men
that
after
all
they
were
men
of
no
worth
who
had
been
making
a
display
of
valour
among
hellenes
a
worthless
race
as
for
you
since
ye
had
had
no
experience
of
the
persians
i
for
my
part
was
very
ready
to
excuse
you
when
ye
praised
these
of
whom
after
all
ye
knew
something
good
but
much
more
i
marvelled
at
artabazos
that
he
should
have
been
afraid
of
the
lacedemonians
and
that
having
been
afraid
he
should
have
uttered
that
most
cowardly
opinion
namely
that
we
ought
to
move
our
army
away
and
go
to
the
city
of
the
thebans
to
be
besieged
there
opinion
about
which
the
king
shall
yet
be
informed
by
me
of
these
things
we
will
speak
in
another
place
now
however
we
must
not
allow
them
to
act
thus
but
we
must
pursue
them
until
they
are
caught
and
pay
the
penalty
to
us
for
all
that
they
did
to
the
persians
in
time
thus
having
spoken
he
led
on
the
persians
at
a
run
after
they
had
crossed
the
asopos
on
the
track
of
the
hellenes
supposing
that
these
were
running
away
from
him
and
he
directed
his
attack
upon
the
lacedemonians
and
tegeans
only
for
the
athenians
whose
march
was
towards
the
plain
he
did
not
see
by
reason
of
the
hills
then
the
rest
of
the
commanders
of
the
barbarian
divisions
seeing
that
the
persians
had
started
to
pursue
the
hellenes
forthwith
all
raised
the
signals
for
battle
and
began
to
pursue
each
as
fast
as
they
could
not
arranged
in
any
order
or
succession
of
these
then
were
coming
on
with
shouting
and
confused
numbers
thinking
to
make
short
work
of
the
hellenes
and
pausanias
when
the
cavalry
began
to
attack
sent
to
the
athenians
a
horseman
and
said
thus
athenians
now
that
the
greatest
contest
is
set
before
us
namely
that
which
has
for
its
issue
the
freedom
or
the
slavery
of
hellas
we
have
been
deserted
by
our
allies
we
lacedemonians
and
ye
athenians
seeing
that
they
have
run
away
during
the
night
that
is
past
now
therefore
it
is
determined
what
we
must
do
upon
this
namely
that
we
must
defend
ourselves
and
protect
one
another
as
best
we
may
if
then
the
cavalry
had
set
forth
to
attack
you
at
the
first
we
and
the
tegeans
who
with
us
refuse
to
betray
the
cause
of
hellas
should
have
been
bound
to
go
to
your
help
but
as
it
is
since
the
whole
body
has
come
against
us
it
is
right
that
ye
should
come
to
that
portion
of
the
army
which
is
hardest
pressed
to
give
aid
if
however
anything
has
happened
to
you
which
makes
it
impossible
for
you
to
come
to
our
help
then
do
us
a
kindness
by
sending
to
us
the
archers
and
we
know
that
ye
have
been
in
the
course
of
this
present
war
by
far
the
most
zealous
of
all
so
that
ye
will
listen
to
our
request
in
this
matter
when
the
athenians
heard
this
they
were
desirous
to
come
to
their
help
and
to
assist
them
as
much
as
possible
and
as
they
were
already
going
they
were
attacked
by
those
of
the
hellenes
on
the
side
of
the
king
who
had
been
ranged
opposite
to
them
so
that
they
were
no
longer
able
to
come
to
the
help
of
the
lacedemonians
for
the
force
that
was
attacking
them
gave
them
much
trouble
thus
the
lacedemonians
and
tegeans
were
left
alone
being
in
number
together
with
men
the
former
fifty
thousand
and
the
tegeans
three
thousand
for
these
were
not
parted
at
all
from
the
lacedemonians
and
they
began
to
offer
sacrifice
meaning
to
engage
battle
with
mardonios
and
the
force
which
had
come
against
them
then
since
their
offerings
did
not
prove
favourable
and
many
of
them
were
being
slain
during
this
time
and
many
more
wounded
the
persians
had
made
a
palisade
of
their
shields
and
were
discharging
their
arrows
in
great
multitude
and
without
sparing
seeing
that
the
spartans
were
hard
pressed
and
that
the
offerings
did
not
prove
favourable
fixed
his
gaze
upon
the
temple
of
hera
of
the
plataians
and
called
upon
the
goddess
to
help
praying
that
they
might
by
no
means
be
cheated
of
their
hope
and
while
he
was
yet
calling
upon
her
thus
the
tegeans
started
forward
before
them
and
advanced
against
the
barbarians
and
forthwith
after
the
prayer
of
pausanias
the
offerings
proved
favourable
for
the
lacedemonians
as
they
sacrificed
so
when
this
at
length
came
to
pass
then
they
also
advanced
against
the
persians
and
the
persians
put
away
their
bows
and
came
against
them
then
first
there
was
fighting
about
the
shields
and
when
these
had
been
overturned
after
that
the
fighting
was
fierce
by
the
side
of
the
temple
of
demeter
and
so
continued
for
a
long
time
until
at
last
they
came
to
justling
for
the
barbarians
would
take
hold
of
the
spears
and
break
them
off
now
in
courage
and
in
strength
the
persians
were
not
inferior
to
the
others
but
they
were
without
defensive
armour
and
moreover
they
were
unversed
in
war
and
unequal
to
their
opponents
in
skill
and
they
would
dart
out
one
at
a
time
or
in
groups
of
about
ten
together
some
more
and
some
less
and
fall
upon
the
spartans
and
in
the
place
where
mardonios
himself
was
riding
on
a
white
horse
and
having
about
him
the
thousand
best
men
of
the
persians
chosen
out
from
the
rest
here
i
say
they
pressed
upon
their
opponents
most
of
all
and
so
long
as
mardonios
survived
they
held
out
against
them
and
defending
themselves
they
cast
down
many
of
the
lacedemonians
but
when
mardonios
was
slain
and
the
men
who
were
ranged
about
his
person
which
was
the
strongest
portion
of
the
whole
army
had
fallen
then
the
others
too
turned
and
gave
way
before
the
lacedemonians
for
their
manner
of
dress
without
defensive
armour
was
a
very
great
cause
of
destruction
to
them
since
in
truth
they
were
contending
against
then
the
satisfaction
for
the
murder
of
leonidas
was
paid
by
mardonios
according
to
the
oracle
given
to
the
spartans
and
the
most
famous
victory
of
all
those
about
which
we
have
knowledge
was
gained
by
pausanias
the
son
of
cleombrotos
the
son
of
anaxandrides
of
his
ancestors
above
this
the
names
have
been
given
for
leonidas
since
as
it
happens
they
are
the
same
for
both
now
mardonios
was
slain
by
arimnestos
a
man
of
consideration
in
sparta
who
afterwards
when
the
median
wars
were
over
with
three
hundred
men
fought
a
battle
against
the
whole
army
of
the
messenians
then
at
war
with
the
lacedemonians
at
stenycleros
and
both
he
was
slain
and
also
the
three
when
the
persians
were
turned
to
flight
at
plataia
by
the
lacedemonians
they
fled
in
disorder
to
their
own
camp
and
to
the
palisade
which
they
had
made
in
the
theban
territory
and
it
is
a
marvel
to
me
that
whereas
they
fought
by
the
side
of
the
sacred
grove
of
demeter
not
one
of
the
persians
was
found
to
have
entered
the
enclosure
or
to
have
been
slain
within
it
but
round
about
the
temple
in
the
unconsecrated
ground
fell
the
greater
number
of
the
slain
i
suppose
if
one
ought
to
suppose
anything
about
divine
things
that
the
goddess
herself
refused
to
receive
them
because
they
had
set
fire
to
the
temple
that
is
to
say
the
palace
at
eleusis
thus
far
then
had
this
battle
proceeded
but
artabazos
the
son
of
pharnakes
had
been
displeased
at
the
very
first
because
mardonios
remained
behind
after
the
king
was
gone
and
afterwards
he
had
been
bringing
forward
objections
continually
and
doing
nothing
but
had
urged
them
always
not
to
fight
a
battle
and
for
himself
he
acted
as
follows
not
being
pleased
with
the
things
which
were
being
done
by
men
of
whom
artabazos
was
commander
and
he
had
with
him
no
small
force
but
one
which
was
in
number
as
much
as
four
myriads
of
men
these
when
the
fighting
began
being
well
aware
what
the
issue
of
the
battle
would
be
he
led
carefully
having
first
given
orders
that
all
should
go
by
the
way
which
he
should
lead
them
and
at
the
same
pace
at
which
they
should
see
him
go
having
given
these
orders
he
led
his
troops
on
pretence
of
taking
them
into
battle
and
when
he
was
well
on
his
way
he
saw
the
persians
already
taking
flight
then
he
no
longer
led
his
men
in
the
same
order
as
before
but
set
off
at
a
run
taking
flight
by
the
quickest
way
not
to
the
palisade
nor
yet
to
the
wall
of
the
thebans
but
towards
phokis
desiring
as
quickly
as
possible
to
reach
the
these
i
say
were
thus
directing
their
march
and
in
the
meantime
while
the
other
hellenes
who
were
on
the
side
of
the
king
were
purposely
slack
in
the
fight
the
boeotians
fought
with
the
athenians
for
a
long
space
for
those
of
the
thebans
who
took
the
side
of
the
medes
had
no
small
zeal
for
the
cause
and
they
fought
and
were
not
slack
so
that
three
hundred
of
them
the
first
and
best
of
all
fell
there
by
the
hands
of
the
athenians
and
when
these
also
turned
to
flight
they
fled
to
thebes
not
to
the
same
place
as
the
persians
and
the
main
body
of
the
other
allies
fled
without
having
fought
constantly
with
any
one
or
displayed
any
deeds
of
and
this
is
an
additional
proof
to
me
that
all
the
fortunes
of
the
barbarians
depended
upon
the
persians
namely
that
at
that
time
these
men
fled
before
they
had
even
engaged
with
the
enemy
because
they
saw
the
persians
doing
so
thus
all
were
in
flight
except
only
the
cavalry
including
also
that
of
the
boeotians
and
this
rendered
service
to
the
fugitives
by
constantly
keeping
close
to
the
enemy
and
separating
the
fugitives
of
their
own
side
from
the
the
victors
then
were
coming
after
the
troops
of
xerxes
both
pursuing
them
and
slaughtering
them
and
during
the
time
when
this
panic
arose
the
report
was
brought
to
the
other
hellenes
who
had
posted
themselves
about
the
temple
of
hera
and
had
been
absent
from
the
battle
that
a
battle
had
taken
place
and
that
the
troops
of
pausanias
were
gaining
the
victory
when
they
heard
this
then
without
ranging
themselves
in
any
order
the
corinthians
and
those
near
them
turned
to
go
by
the
skirts
of
the
mountain
and
by
the
low
hills
along
the
way
which
led
straight
up
to
the
temple
of
demeter
while
the
megarians
and
phliasians
and
those
near
them
went
by
the
plain
along
the
smoothest
way
when
however
the
megarians
and
phliasians
came
near
to
the
enemy
the
cavalry
of
the
thebans
caught
sight
of
them
from
a
distance
hurrying
along
without
any
order
and
rode
up
to
attack
them
the
commander
of
the
cavalry
being
asopodoros
the
son
of
timander
and
having
fallen
upon
them
they
slew
six
hundred
of
them
and
the
rest
they
pursued
and
drove
to
kithairon
these
then
perished
thus
ingloriously
and
meanwhile
the
persians
and
the
rest
of
the
throng
having
fled
for
refuge
to
the
palisade
succeeded
in
getting
up
to
the
towers
before
the
lacedemonians
came
and
having
got
up
they
strengthened
the
wall
of
defence
as
best
they
could
then
when
the
lacedemonians
came
up
to
attack
it
there
began
between
them
a
vigorous
fight
for
the
wall
for
so
long
as
the
athenians
were
away
they
defended
themselves
and
had
much
the
advantage
over
the
lacedemonians
since
these
did
not
understand
the
art
of
fighting
against
walls
but
when
the
athenians
came
up
to
help
them
then
there
was
a
fierce
fight
for
the
wall
lasting
for
a
long
time
and
at
length
by
valour
and
endurance
the
athenians
mounted
up
on
the
wall
and
made
a
breach
in
it
through
which
the
hellenes
poured
in
now
the
tegeans
were
the
first
who
entered
the
wall
and
these
were
they
who
plundered
the
tent
of
mardonios
taking
besides
the
other
things
which
were
in
it
also
the
manger
of
his
horse
which
was
all
of
bronze
and
a
sight
worth
seeing
this
manger
of
mardonios
was
dedicated
by
the
tegeans
as
an
offering
in
the
temple
of
athene
alea
but
all
the
other
things
which
they
took
they
brought
to
the
common
stock
of
the
hellenes
the
barbarians
however
after
the
wall
had
been
captured
no
longer
formed
themselves
into
any
close
body
nor
did
any
of
them
think
of
making
resistance
but
they
were
utterly
at
a
loss
as
you
might
expect
from
men
who
were
in
a
panic
with
many
myriads
of
them
shut
up
together
in
a
small
space
and
the
hellenes
were
able
to
slaughter
them
so
that
out
of
an
army
of
thirty
myriads
if
those
four
be
subtracted
which
artabazos
took
with
him
in
his
flight
of
the
remainder
not
three
thousand
men
survived
of
the
lacedemonians
from
sparta
there
were
slain
in
the
battle
in
all
of
the
tegeans
sixteen
and
of
the
athenians
among
the
barbarians
those
who
proved
themselves
the
best
men
were
of
those
on
foot
the
persians
and
of
the
cavalry
the
sacans
and
for
a
single
man
mardonios
it
is
said
was
the
best
of
the
hellenes
though
both
the
tegeans
and
the
athenians
proved
themselves
good
men
yet
the
lacedemonians
surpassed
them
in
valour
of
this
i
have
no
other
proof
for
all
these
were
victorious
over
their
opposites
but
only
this
that
they
fought
against
the
strongest
part
of
the
enemy
force
and
overcame
it
and
the
man
who
proved
himself
in
my
opinion
by
much
the
best
was
that
aristodemos
who
having
come
back
safe
from
thermopylai
alone
of
the
three
hundred
had
reproach
and
dishonour
attached
to
him
after
him
the
best
were
poseidonios
and
philokyon
and
amompharetos
the
spartan
however
when
there
came
to
be
conversation
as
to
which
of
them
had
proved
himself
the
best
the
spartans
who
were
present
gave
it
as
their
opinion
that
aristodemos
had
evidently
wished
to
be
slain
in
consequence
of
the
charge
which
lay
against
him
and
so
being
as
it
were
in
a
frenzy
and
leaving
his
place
in
the
ranks
he
had
displayed
great
deeds
whereas
poseidonios
had
proved
himself
a
good
man
although
he
did
not
desire
to
be
slain
and
so
far
he
was
the
better
man
of
the
two
this
however
they
perhaps
said
from
and
all
these
whose
names
i
mentioned
among
the
men
who
were
killed
in
this
battle
were
specially
honoured
except
aristodemos
but
aristodemos
since
he
desired
to
be
slain
on
account
of
the
charge
was
not
honoured
these
obtained
the
most
renown
of
those
who
fought
at
plataia
for
as
for
callicrates
the
most
beautiful
who
came
to
the
camp
not
of
the
lacedemonians
alone
but
also
of
all
the
hellenes
of
his
time
he
was
not
killed
in
the
battle
itself
but
when
pausanias
was
offering
sacrifice
he
was
wounded
by
an
arrow
in
the
side
as
he
was
sitting
down
in
his
place
in
the
ranks
and
while
the
others
were
fighting
he
having
been
carried
out
of
the
ranks
was
dying
a
lingering
death
and
he
said
to
arimnestos
a
plataian
that
it
did
not
grieve
him
to
die
for
hellas
but
it
grieved
him
only
that
he
had
not
proved
his
strength
of
hand
and
that
no
deed
of
valour
had
been
displayed
by
him
worthy
of
the
spirit
which
he
had
in
him
to
perform
great
deeds
of
the
athenians
the
man
who
gained
most
glory
is
said
to
have
been
sophanes
the
son
of
eutychides
of
the
deme
of
dekeleia
deme
of
which
the
inhabitants
formerly
did
a
deed
that
was
of
service
to
them
for
all
time
as
the
athenians
themselves
report
for
when
of
old
the
sons
of
tyndareus
invaded
the
attic
land
with
a
great
host
in
order
to
bring
home
helen
and
were
laying
waste
the
demes
not
knowing
to
what
place
of
hiding
helen
had
been
removed
then
they
say
that
the
men
of
dekeleia
or
as
some
say
dekelos
himself
being
aggrieved
by
the
insolence
of
theseus
and
fearing
for
all
the
land
of
the
athenians
told
them
the
whole
matter
and
led
them
to
aphidnai
which
titakos
who
was
sprung
from
the
soil
delivered
up
by
treachery
to
the
sons
of
tyndareus
in
consequence
of
this
deed
the
dekeleians
have
had
continually
freedom
from
dues
in
sparta
and
front
seats
at
the
games
privileges
which
exist
still
to
this
day
insomuch
that
even
in
the
war
which
many
years
after
these
events
arose
between
the
athenians
and
the
peloponnesians
when
the
lacedemonians
laid
waste
all
the
rest
of
attica
they
abstained
from
injury
to
to
this
deme
belonged
sophanes
who
showed
himself
the
best
of
all
the
athenians
in
this
battle
and
of
him
there
are
two
different
stories
told
one
that
he
carried
an
anchor
of
iron
bound
by
chains
of
bronze
to
the
belt
of
his
corslet
and
this
he
threw
whensoever
he
came
up
with
the
enemy
in
order
they
say
that
the
enemy
when
they
came
forth
out
of
their
ranks
might
not
be
able
to
move
him
from
his
place
and
when
a
flight
of
his
opponents
took
place
his
plan
was
to
take
up
the
anchor
first
and
then
pursue
after
them
this
story
is
reported
thus
but
the
other
of
the
stories
disputing
the
truth
of
that
which
has
been
told
above
is
reported
as
follows
namely
that
upon
his
shield
which
was
ever
moving
about
and
never
remaining
still
he
bore
an
anchor
as
a
device
and
not
one
of
iron
bound
to
his
corslet
there
was
another
illustrious
deed
done
too
by
sophanes
for
when
the
athenians
besieged
egina
he
challenged
to
a
fight
and
slew
eurybates
the
argive
one
who
had
been
victor
in
the
five
contests
at
the
games
to
sophanes
himself
it
happened
after
these
events
that
when
he
was
general
of
the
athenians
together
with
leagros
the
son
of
glaucon
he
was
slain
after
proving
himself
a
good
man
by
the
edonians
at
daton
fighting
for
the
gold
mines
when
the
barbarians
had
been
laid
low
by
the
hellenes
at
plataia
there
approached
to
these
a
woman
the
concubine
of
pharandates
the
son
of
teaspis
a
persian
coming
over
of
her
own
free
will
from
the
enemy
who
when
she
perceived
that
the
persians
had
been
destroyed
and
that
the
hellenes
were
the
victors
descended
from
her
carriage
and
came
up
to
the
lacedemonians
while
they
were
yet
engaged
in
the
slaughter
this
woman
had
adorned
herself
with
many
ornaments
of
gold
and
her
attendants
likewise
and
she
had
put
on
the
fairest
robe
of
those
which
she
had
and
when
she
saw
that
pausanias
was
directing
everything
there
being
well
acquainted
before
with
his
name
and
with
his
lineage
because
she
had
heard
it
often
she
recognised
pausanias
and
taking
hold
of
his
knees
she
said
these
words
o
king
of
sparta
deliver
me
thy
suppliant
from
the
slavery
of
the
captive
for
thou
hast
also
done
me
service
hitherto
in
destroying
these
who
have
regard
neither
for
demigods
nor
yet
for
gods
i
am
by
race
of
cos
the
daughter
of
hegetorides
the
son
of
antagoras
and
the
persian
took
me
by
force
in
cos
and
kept
me
a
prisoner
he
made
answer
in
these
words
woman
be
of
good
courage
both
because
thou
art
a
suppliant
and
also
if
in
addition
to
this
it
chances
that
thou
art
speaking
the
truth
and
art
the
daughter
of
hegetorides
the
coan
who
is
bound
to
me
as
a
more
than
any
other
of
the
men
who
dwell
in
those
parts
having
thus
spoken
for
that
time
her
gave
her
in
charge
to
those
ephors
who
were
present
and
afterwards
he
sent
her
away
to
egina
whither
she
herself
desired
to
go
after
the
arrival
of
the
woman
forthwith
upon
this
arrived
the
mantineians
when
all
was
over
and
having
learnt
that
they
had
come
too
late
for
the
battle
they
were
greatly
grieved
and
said
that
they
deserved
to
be
punished
and
being
informed
that
the
medes
with
artabazos
were
in
flight
they
pursued
after
them
as
far
as
thessaly
though
the
lacedemonians
endeavoured
to
prevent
them
from
pursuing
after
fugitives
then
returning
back
to
their
own
country
they
sent
the
leaders
of
their
army
into
exile
from
the
land
after
the
mantineians
came
the
eleians
and
they
like
the
mantineians
were
greatly
grieved
by
it
and
so
departed
home
and
these
also
when
they
had
returned
sent
their
leaders
into
exile
so
much
of
the
mantineians
and
eleians
at
plataia
among
the
troops
of
the
eginetans
was
lampon
the
son
of
pytheas
one
of
the
leading
men
of
the
eginetans
who
was
moved
to
go
to
pausanias
with
a
most
impious
proposal
and
when
he
had
come
with
haste
he
said
as
follows
son
of
cleombrotos
a
deed
has
been
done
by
thee
which
is
of
marvellous
greatness
and
glory
and
to
thee
god
has
permitted
by
rescuing
hellas
to
lay
up
for
thyself
the
greatest
renown
of
all
the
hellenes
about
whom
we
have
any
knowledge
do
thou
then
perform
also
that
which
remains
to
do
after
these
things
in
order
that
yet
greater
reputation
may
attach
to
thee
and
also
that
in
future
every
one
of
the
barbarians
may
beware
of
being
the
beginner
of
presumptuous
deeds
towards
the
hellenes
for
when
leonidas
was
slain
at
thermopylai
mardonios
and
xerxes
cut
off
his
head
and
crucified
him
to
him
therefore
do
thou
repay
like
with
like
and
thou
shalt
have
praise
first
from
all
the
spartans
and
then
secondly
from
the
other
hellenes
also
for
if
thou
impale
the
body
of
mardonios
thou
wilt
then
have
taken
vengeance
for
leonidas
thy
father
he
said
this
thinking
to
give
pleasure
but
the
other
made
him
answer
in
these
words
stranger
of
egina
i
admire
thy
friendly
spirit
and
thy
forethought
for
me
but
thou
hast
failed
of
a
good
opinion
nevertheless
for
having
exalted
me
on
high
and
my
family
and
my
deed
thou
didst
then
cast
me
down
to
nought
by
advising
me
to
do
outrage
to
a
dead
body
and
by
saying
that
if
i
do
this
i
shall
be
better
reported
of
these
things
it
is
more
fitting
for
barbarians
to
do
than
for
hellenes
and
even
with
them
we
find
fault
for
doing
so
however
that
may
be
i
do
not
desire
in
any
such
manner
as
this
to
please
either
eginetans
or
others
who
like
such
things
but
it
is
enough
for
me
that
i
should
keep
from
unholy
deeds
yea
and
from
unholy
speech
also
and
so
please
the
spartans
as
for
leonidas
whom
thou
biddest
me
avenge
i
declare
that
he
has
been
greatly
avenged
already
and
by
the
unnumbered
lives
which
have
been
taken
of
these
men
he
has
been
honoured
and
not
he
only
but
also
the
rest
who
brought
their
lives
to
an
end
at
thermopylai
as
for
thee
however
come
not
again
to
me
with
such
a
proposal
nor
give
me
such
advice
and
be
thankful
moreover
that
thou
hast
no
punishment
for
it
now
he
having
heard
this
went
his
way
and
pausanias
made
a
proclamation
that
none
should
lay
hands
upon
the
spoil
and
he
ordered
the
helots
to
collect
the
things
together
they
accordingly
dispersed
themselves
about
the
camp
and
found
tents
furnished
with
gold
and
silver
and
beds
overlaid
with
gold
and
overlaid
with
silver
and
of
gold
and
cups
and
other
drinking
vessels
they
found
also
sacks
laid
upon
waggons
in
which
there
proved
to
be
caldrons
both
of
gold
and
of
silver
and
from
the
dead
bodies
which
lay
there
they
stripped
bracelets
and
collars
and
also
their
swords
if
they
were
of
gold
for
as
to
embroidered
raiment
there
was
no
account
made
of
it
then
the
helots
stole
many
of
the
things
and
sold
them
to
the
eginetans
but
many
things
also
they
delivered
up
as
many
of
them
as
they
could
not
conceal
so
that
the
great
wealth
of
the
eginetans
first
came
from
this
that
they
bought
the
gold
from
the
helots
making
pretence
that
it
was
then
having
brought
the
things
together
and
having
set
apart
a
tithe
for
the
god
of
delphi
with
which
the
offering
was
dedicated
of
the
golden
tripod
which
rests
upon
the
serpent
of
bronze
and
stands
close
by
the
altar
and
also
for
the
god
at
olympia
with
which
they
dedicated
the
offering
of
a
bronze
statue
of
zeus
ten
cubits
high
and
finally
for
the
god
at
the
isthmus
with
which
was
made
a
bronze
statue
of
poseidon
seven
cubits
high
set
apart
these
things
they
divided
the
rest
and
each
took
that
which
they
ought
to
have
including
the
concubines
of
the
persians
and
the
gold
and
the
silver
and
the
other
things
and
also
the
beasts
of
burden
how
much
was
set
apart
and
given
to
those
of
them
who
had
proved
themselves
the
best
men
at
plataia
is
not
reported
by
any
though
for
my
part
i
suppose
that
gifts
were
made
to
these
also
pausanias
however
had
ten
of
each
thing
set
apart
and
given
to
him
that
is
women
horses
talents
camels
and
so
also
of
the
other
things
it
is
said
moreover
that
this
was
done
which
here
follows
namely
that
xerxes
in
his
flight
from
hellas
had
left
to
mardonios
the
furniture
of
his
own
tent
and
pausanias
accordingly
seeing
the
furniture
of
mardonios
furnished
with
gold
and
silver
and
hangings
of
different
colours
ordered
the
bakers
and
the
cooks
to
prepare
a
meal
as
they
were
used
to
do
for
mardonios
then
when
they
did
this
as
they
had
been
commanded
it
is
said
that
pausanias
seeing
the
couches
of
gold
and
of
silver
with
luxurious
coverings
and
the
tables
of
gold
and
silver
and
the
magnificent
apparatus
of
the
feast
was
astonished
at
the
good
things
set
before
him
and
for
sport
he
ordered
his
own
servants
to
prepare
a
laconian
meal
and
as
when
the
banquet
was
served
the
difference
between
the
two
was
great
pausanias
laughed
and
sent
for
the
commanders
of
the
hellenes
and
when
these
had
come
together
pausanias
said
pointing
to
the
preparation
of
the
two
meals
severally
hellenes
for
this
reason
i
assembled
you
together
because
i
desired
to
show
you
the
senselessness
of
this
leader
of
the
medes
who
having
such
fare
as
this
came
to
us
who
have
such
sorry
fare
as
ye
see
here
in
order
to
take
it
away
from
us
thus
it
is
said
that
pausanias
spoke
to
the
commanders
of
the
hellenes
however
in
later
time
after
these
events
many
of
the
plataians
also
found
chests
of
gold
and
of
silver
and
of
other
treasures
and
moreover
afterwards
this
which
follows
was
seen
in
the
case
of
the
dead
bodies
here
after
the
flesh
had
been
stripped
off
from
the
bones
for
the
plataians
brought
together
the
bones
all
to
one
place
was
found
i
say
a
skull
with
no
suture
but
all
of
one
bone
and
there
was
seen
also
a
that
is
to
say
the
upper
part
of
the
jaw
which
had
teeth
joined
together
and
all
of
one
bone
both
the
teeth
that
bite
and
those
that
grind
and
the
bones
were
seen
also
of
a
man
five
cubits
the
body
of
mardonios
however
had
disappeared
on
the
day
after
the
battle
taken
by
whom
i
am
not
able
with
certainty
to
say
but
i
have
heard
the
names
of
many
men
of
various
cities
who
are
said
to
have
buried
mardonios
and
i
know
that
many
received
gifts
from
artontes
the
son
of
mardonios
for
having
done
this
who
he
was
however
who
took
up
and
buried
the
body
of
mardonios
i
am
not
able
for
certain
to
discover
but
dionysophanes
an
ephesian
is
reported
with
some
show
of
reason
to
have
been
he
who
buried
he
then
was
buried
in
some
such
manner
as
this
and
the
hellenes
when
they
had
divided
the
spoil
at
plataia
proceeded
to
bury
their
dead
each
nation
apart
by
themselves
the
spartans
made
for
themselves
three
several
one
in
which
they
buried
the
younger
spartans
of
whom
also
were
poseidonios
amompharetos
philokyon
and
callicrates
one
of
the
graves
i
say
were
laid
the
younger
men
in
the
second
the
rest
of
the
spartans
and
in
the
third
the
helots
these
then
thus
buried
their
dead
but
the
tegeans
buried
theirs
all
together
in
a
place
apart
from
these
and
the
athenians
theirs
together
and
the
megarians
and
phliasians
those
who
had
been
slain
by
the
cavalry
of
all
these
the
had
bodies
laid
in
them
but
as
to
the
of
other
states
which
are
to
be
seen
at
plataia
these
as
i
am
informed
are
all
mere
mounds
of
earth
without
any
bodies
in
them
raised
by
the
several
peoples
on
account
of
posterity
because
they
were
ashamed
of
their
absence
from
the
fight
for
among
others
there
is
one
there
called
the
of
the
eginetans
which
i
hear
was
raised
at
the
request
of
the
eginetans
by
cleades
the
son
of
autodicos
a
man
of
plataia
who
was
their
public
no
less
than
ten
years
after
these
events
when
the
hellenes
had
buried
their
dead
at
plataia
forthwith
they
determined
in
common
council
to
march
upon
thebes
and
to
ask
the
thebans
to
surrender
those
who
had
taken
the
side
of
the
medes
and
among
the
first
of
them
timagenides
and
attaginos
who
were
leaders
equal
to
the
first
and
if
the
thebans
did
not
give
them
up
they
determined
not
to
retire
from
the
city
until
they
had
taken
it
having
thus
resolved
they
came
accordingly
on
the
eleventh
day
after
the
battle
and
began
to
besiege
the
thebans
bidding
them
give
the
men
up
and
as
the
thebans
refused
to
give
them
up
they
began
to
lay
waste
their
land
and
also
to
attack
their
so
then
as
they
did
not
cease
their
ravages
on
the
twentieth
day
timagenides
spoke
as
follows
to
the
thebans
thebans
since
it
has
been
resolved
by
the
hellenes
not
to
retire
from
the
siege
until
either
they
have
taken
thebes
or
ye
have
delivered
us
up
to
them
now
therefore
let
not
the
land
of
boeotia
suffer
any
more
for
our
sakes
but
if
they
desire
to
have
money
and
are
demanding
our
surrender
as
a
colour
for
this
let
us
give
them
money
taken
out
of
the
treasury
of
the
state
for
we
took
the
side
of
the
medes
together
with
the
state
and
not
by
ourselves
alone
but
if
they
are
making
the
siege
truly
in
order
to
get
us
into
their
hands
then
we
will
give
ourselves
up
for
trial
in
this
it
was
thought
that
he
spoke
very
well
and
seasonably
and
the
thebans
forthwith
sent
a
herald
to
pausanias
offering
to
deliver
up
the
after
they
had
made
an
agreement
on
these
terms
attaginos
escaped
out
of
the
city
and
when
his
sons
were
delivered
up
to
pausanias
he
released
them
from
the
charge
saying
that
the
sons
had
no
share
in
the
guilt
of
taking
the
side
of
the
medes
as
to
the
other
men
whom
the
thebans
delivered
up
they
supposed
that
they
would
get
a
trial
and
they
trusted
moreover
to
be
able
to
repel
the
danger
by
payment
of
money
but
pausanias
when
he
had
received
them
suspecting
this
very
thing
first
dismissed
the
whole
army
of
allies
and
then
took
the
men
to
corinth
and
put
them
to
death
there
these
were
the
things
which
happened
at
plataia
and
at
thebes
artabazos
meanwhile
the
son
of
pharnakes
in
his
flight
from
plataia
was
by
this
time
getting
forward
on
his
way
and
the
thessalians
when
he
came
to
them
offered
him
hospitality
and
inquired
concerning
the
rest
of
the
army
not
knowing
anything
of
that
which
had
happened
at
plataia
and
artabazos
knowing
that
if
he
should
tell
them
the
whole
truth
about
the
fighting
he
would
run
the
risk
of
being
destroyed
both
himself
and
the
whole
army
which
was
with
him
for
he
thought
that
they
would
all
set
upon
him
if
they
were
informed
of
that
which
had
happened
i
say
upon
this
he
had
told
nothing
of
it
to
the
phokians
and
now
to
the
thessalians
he
spoke
as
follows
i
as
you
see
thessalians
am
earnest
to
march
by
the
shortest
way
to
thracia
and
i
am
in
great
haste
having
been
sent
with
these
men
for
a
certain
business
from
the
army
moreover
mardonios
himself
and
his
army
are
shortly
to
be
looked
for
here
marching
close
after
me
to
him
give
entertainment
and
show
yourselves
serviceable
for
ye
will
not
in
the
end
repent
of
so
doing
having
thus
said
he
continued
to
march
his
army
with
haste
through
thessaly
and
macedonia
straight
for
thracia
being
in
truth
earnest
to
proceed
and
going
through
the
land
by
the
shortest
possible
way
and
so
he
came
to
byzantion
having
left
behind
him
great
numbers
of
his
army
who
had
either
been
cut
down
by
the
thracians
on
the
way
or
had
been
overcome
by
hunger
and
fatigue
and
from
byzantion
he
passed
over
in
ships
he
himself
then
thus
made
his
return
back
to
asia
now
on
the
same
day
on
which
the
defeat
took
place
at
plataia
another
took
place
also
as
fortune
would
have
it
at
mycale
in
ionia
for
when
the
hellenes
who
had
come
in
the
ships
with
leotychides
the
lacedemonian
were
lying
at
delos
there
came
to
them
as
envoys
from
samos
lampon
the
son
of
thrasycles
and
athenagoras
the
son
of
archestratides
and
hegesistratos
the
son
of
aristagoras
who
had
been
sent
by
the
people
of
samos
without
the
knowledge
either
of
the
persians
or
of
the
despot
theomestor
the
son
of
androdamas
whom
the
persians
had
set
up
to
be
despot
of
samos
when
these
had
been
introduced
before
the
commanders
hegesistratos
spoke
at
great
length
using
arguments
of
all
kinds
and
saying
that
so
soon
as
the
ionians
should
see
them
they
would
at
once
revolt
from
the
persians
and
that
the
barbarians
would
not
wait
for
their
attack
and
if
after
all
they
did
so
then
the
hellenes
would
take
a
prize
such
as
they
would
never
take
again
hereafter
and
appealing
to
the
gods
worshipped
in
common
he
endeavoured
to
persuade
them
to
rescue
from
slavery
men
who
were
hellenes
and
to
drive
away
the
barbarian
and
this
he
said
was
easy
for
them
to
do
for
the
ships
of
the
enemy
sailed
badly
and
were
no
match
for
them
in
fight
moreover
if
the
hellenes
suspected
that
they
were
endeavouring
to
bring
them
on
by
fraud
they
were
ready
to
be
taken
as
hostages
in
their
then
as
the
stranger
of
samos
was
urgent
in
his
prayer
leotychides
inquired
thus
either
desiring
to
hear
for
the
sake
of
the
omen
or
perhaps
by
a
chance
which
providence
brought
about
stranger
of
samos
what
is
thy
name
he
said
hegesistratos
the
other
cut
short
the
rest
of
the
speech
stopping
all
that
hegesistratos
had
intended
to
say
further
and
said
i
accept
the
augury
given
in
hegesistratos
stranger
of
samos
do
thou
on
thy
part
see
that
thou
give
us
assurance
thou
and
the
men
who
are
with
thee
that
the
samians
will
without
fail
be
our
zealous
allies
and
after
that
sail
away
thus
he
spoke
and
to
the
words
he
added
the
deed
for
forthwith
the
samians
gave
assurance
and
made
oaths
of
alliance
with
the
hellenes
and
having
so
done
the
others
sailed
away
home
but
hegesistratos
he
bade
sail
with
the
hellenes
considering
the
name
to
be
an
augury
of
good
success
then
the
hellenes
after
staying
still
that
day
made
sacrifices
for
success
on
the
next
day
their
diviner
being
deïphonos
the
son
of
euenios
an
apolloniate
of
that
apollonia
which
lies
in
the
ionian
gulf
to
this
man
father
euenios
it
happened
as
follows
are
at
this
place
apollonia
sheep
sacred
to
the
sun
which
during
the
day
feed
by
a
river
running
from
mount
lacmon
through
the
land
of
apollonia
to
the
sea
by
the
haven
of
oricos
and
by
night
they
are
watched
by
men
chosen
for
this
purpose
who
are
the
most
highly
considered
of
the
citizens
for
wealth
and
noble
birth
each
man
having
charge
of
them
for
a
year
for
the
people
of
apollonia
set
great
store
on
these
sheep
by
reason
of
an
oracle
and
they
are
folded
in
a
cave
at
some
distance
from
the
city
here
at
the
time
of
which
i
speak
this
man
euenios
was
keeping
watch
over
them
having
been
chosen
for
that
purpose
and
it
happened
one
night
that
he
fell
asleep
during
his
watch
and
wolves
came
by
into
the
cave
and
killed
about
sixty
of
the
sheep
when
he
perceived
this
he
kept
it
secret
and
told
no
one
meaning
to
buy
others
and
substitute
them
in
the
place
of
those
that
were
killed
it
was
discovered
however
by
the
people
of
apollonia
that
this
had
happened
and
when
they
were
informed
of
it
they
brought
him
up
before
a
court
and
condemned
him
to
be
deprived
of
his
eyesight
for
having
fallen
asleep
during
his
watch
but
when
they
had
blinded
euenios
forthwith
after
this
their
flocks
ceased
to
bring
forth
young
and
their
land
to
bear
crops
as
before
then
prophesyings
were
uttered
to
them
both
at
dodona
and
also
at
delphi
when
they
asked
the
prophets
the
cause
of
the
evil
which
they
were
suffering
and
they
told
them
that
they
had
done
unjustly
in
depriving
of
his
sight
euenios
the
watcher
of
the
sacred
sheep
for
the
gods
of
whom
they
inquired
had
themselves
sent
the
wolves
to
attack
the
sheep
and
they
would
not
cease
to
take
vengeance
for
him
till
the
men
of
apollonia
should
have
paid
to
euenios
such
satisfaction
as
he
himself
should
choose
and
deem
sufficient
and
this
being
fulfilled
the
gods
would
give
to
euenios
a
gift
of
such
a
kind
that
many
men
would
think
him
happy
in
that
he
possessed
these
oracles
then
were
uttered
to
them
and
the
people
of
apollonia
making
a
secret
of
it
proposed
to
certain
men
of
the
citizens
to
manage
the
affair
and
they
managed
it
for
them
thus
euenios
was
sitting
on
a
seat
in
public
they
came
and
sat
by
him
and
conversed
about
other
matters
and
at
last
they
came
to
sympathising
with
him
in
his
misfortune
and
thus
leading
him
on
they
asked
what
satisfaction
he
should
choose
if
the
people
of
apollonia
should
undertake
to
give
him
satisfaction
for
that
which
they
had
done
he
then
not
having
heard
the
oracle
made
choice
and
said
that
if
there
should
be
given
him
the
lands
belonging
to
certain
citizens
naming
those
whom
he
knew
to
possess
the
two
best
lots
of
land
in
apollonia
and
a
also
with
these
which
he
knew
to
be
the
best
house
in
the
city
he
became
the
possessor
of
these
he
said
he
would
have
no
anger
against
them
for
the
future
and
this
satisfaction
would
be
sufficient
for
him
if
it
should
be
given
then
as
he
was
thus
speaking
the
men
who
sat
by
him
said
interrupting
him
euenios
this
satisfaction
the
apolloniates
pay
to
thee
for
thy
blinding
in
accordance
with
the
oracles
which
have
been
given
to
them
upon
this
he
was
angry
being
thus
informed
of
the
whole
matter
and
considering
that
he
had
been
deceived
and
they
bought
the
property
from
those
who
possessed
it
and
gave
him
that
which
he
had
chosen
and
forthwith
after
this
he
had
a
natural
gift
of
divination
so
that
he
became
very
of
this
euenios
i
say
deïphonos
was
the
son
and
he
was
acting
as
diviner
for
the
army
being
brought
by
the
corinthians
i
have
heard
however
also
that
deïphonos
wrongly
made
use
of
the
name
of
euenios
and
undertook
work
of
this
kind
about
hellas
not
being
really
the
son
of
euenios
now
when
the
sacrifices
were
favourable
to
the
hellenes
they
put
their
ships
to
sea
from
delos
to
go
to
samos
and
having
arrived
off
calamisa
in
samos
they
moored
their
ships
there
opposite
the
temple
of
hera
which
is
at
this
place
and
made
preparations
for
a
but
the
persians
being
informed
that
they
were
sailing
thither
put
out
to
sea
also
and
went
over
to
the
mainland
with
their
remaining
ships
those
of
the
phenicians
having
been
already
sent
away
to
sail
home
for
deliberating
of
the
matter
they
thought
it
good
not
to
fight
a
battle
by
sea
since
they
did
not
think
that
they
were
a
match
for
the
enemy
and
they
sailed
away
to
the
mainland
in
order
that
they
might
be
under
the
protection
of
their
which
was
in
mycale
a
body
which
had
stayed
behind
the
rest
of
the
army
by
command
of
xerxes
and
was
keeping
watch
over
ionia
of
this
the
number
was
six
myriads
and
the
commander
of
it
was
tigranes
who
in
beauty
and
stature
excelled
the
other
persians
the
commanders
of
the
fleet
then
had
determined
to
take
refuge
under
the
protection
of
this
army
and
to
draw
up
their
ships
on
shore
and
put
an
enclosure
round
as
a
protection
for
the
ships
and
a
refuge
for
having
thus
determined
they
began
to
put
out
to
sea
and
they
came
along
by
the
temple
of
the
revered
goddesses
to
the
gaison
and
to
scolopoeis
in
mycale
where
there
is
a
temple
of
the
eleusinian
demeter
which
philistos
the
son
of
pasicles
erected
when
he
had
accompanied
neileus
the
son
of
codros
for
the
founding
of
miletos
and
there
they
drew
up
their
ships
on
shore
and
put
an
enclosure
round
them
of
stones
and
timber
cutting
down
for
this
purpose
and
they
fixed
stakes
round
the
enclosure
and
made
their
preparations
either
for
being
besieged
or
for
gaining
a
victory
for
in
making
their
preparations
they
reckoned
for
both
chances
the
hellenes
however
when
they
were
informed
that
the
barbarians
had
gone
away
to
the
mainland
were
vexed
because
they
thought
that
they
had
escaped
and
they
were
in
a
difficulty
what
they
should
do
whether
they
should
go
back
home
or
sail
down
towards
the
hellespont
at
last
they
resolved
to
do
neither
of
these
two
things
but
to
sail
on
to
the
mainland
therefore
when
they
had
prepared
as
for
a
both
and
all
other
things
that
were
required
they
sailed
towards
mycale
and
when
they
came
near
to
the
camp
and
no
one
was
seen
to
put
out
against
them
but
they
perceived
ships
drawn
up
within
the
wall
and
a
large
ranged
along
the
shore
then
first
leotychides
sailing
along
in
his
ship
and
coming
as
near
to
the
shore
as
he
could
made
proclamation
by
a
herald
to
the
ionians
saying
ionians
those
of
you
who
chance
to
be
within
hearing
of
me
attend
to
this
which
i
say
for
the
persians
will
not
understand
anything
at
all
of
that
which
i
enjoin
to
you
when
we
join
battle
each
one
of
you
must
remember
first
the
freedom
of
all
and
then
the
watchword
and
this
let
him
also
who
has
not
heard
know
from
him
who
has
heard
the
design
in
this
act
was
the
same
as
that
of
themistocles
at
artemision
for
it
was
meant
that
either
the
words
uttered
should
escape
the
knowledge
of
the
barbarians
and
persuade
the
ionians
or
that
they
should
be
reported
to
the
barbarians
and
make
them
distrustful
of
the
hellenes
after
leotychides
had
thus
suggested
then
next
the
hellenes
proceeded
to
bring
their
ships
up
to
land
and
they
disembarked
upon
the
shore
these
then
were
ranging
themselves
for
fight
and
the
persians
when
they
saw
the
hellenes
preparing
for
battle
and
also
that
they
had
given
exhortation
to
the
ionians
in
the
first
place
deprived
the
samians
of
their
arms
suspecting
that
they
were
inclined
to
the
side
of
the
hellenes
for
when
the
athenian
prisoners
the
men
whom
the
army
of
xerxes
had
found
left
behind
in
attica
had
come
in
the
ships
of
the
barbarians
the
samians
had
ransomed
these
and
sent
them
back
to
athens
supplying
them
with
means
for
their
journey
and
for
this
reason
especially
they
were
suspected
since
they
had
ransomed
five
hundred
persons
of
the
enemies
of
xerxes
then
secondly
the
persians
appointed
the
milesians
to
guard
the
passes
which
lead
to
the
summits
of
mycale
on
the
pretext
that
they
knew
the
country
best
but
their
true
reason
for
doing
this
was
that
they
might
be
out
of
the
camp
against
these
of
the
ionians
who
as
they
suspected
would
make
some
hostile
move
if
they
found
the
occasion
the
persians
sought
to
secure
themselves
in
the
manner
mentioned
and
they
themselves
then
brought
together
their
shields
to
serve
them
as
a
fence
then
when
the
hellenes
had
made
all
their
preparations
they
proceeded
to
the
attack
of
the
barbarians
and
as
they
went
a
rumour
came
suddenly
to
their
whole
army
and
at
the
same
time
a
staff
was
found
lying
upon
the
beach
and
the
rumour
went
through
their
army
to
this
effect
namely
that
the
hellenes
were
fighting
in
boeotia
and
conquering
the
army
of
mardonios
now
by
many
signs
is
the
divine
power
seen
in
earthly
things
and
by
this
among
others
namely
that
now
when
the
day
of
the
defeat
at
plataia
and
of
that
which
was
about
to
take
place
at
mycale
happened
to
be
the
same
a
rumour
came
to
the
hellenes
here
so
that
the
army
was
encouraged
much
more
and
was
more
eagerly
desirous
to
face
the
moreover
this
other
thing
by
coincidence
happened
besides
namely
that
there
was
a
sacred
enclosure
of
the
eleusinian
demeter
close
by
the
side
of
both
the
for
not
only
in
the
plataian
land
did
the
fight
take
place
close
by
the
side
of
the
temple
of
demeter
as
i
have
before
said
but
also
in
mycale
it
was
to
be
so
likewise
and
whereas
the
rumour
which
came
to
them
said
that
a
victory
had
been
already
gained
by
the
hellenes
with
pausanias
this
proved
to
be
a
true
report
for
that
which
was
done
at
plataia
came
about
while
it
was
yet
early
morning
but
the
fighting
at
mycale
took
place
in
the
afternoon
and
that
it
happened
on
the
same
day
of
the
same
month
as
the
other
became
evident
to
them
not
long
afterwards
when
they
inquired
into
the
matter
now
they
had
been
afraid
before
the
rumour
arrived
not
for
themselves
so
much
as
for
the
hellenes
generally
lest
hellas
should
stumble
and
fall
over
mardonios
but
when
this
report
had
come
suddenly
to
them
they
advanced
on
the
enemy
much
more
vigorously
and
swiftly
than
before
the
hellenes
then
and
the
barbarians
were
going
with
eagerness
into
the
battle
since
both
the
islands
and
the
hellespont
were
placed
before
them
as
prizes
of
the
contest
now
for
the
athenians
and
those
who
were
ranged
next
to
them
to
the
number
perhaps
of
half
the
whole
army
the
road
lay
along
the
and
over
level
ground
while
the
lacedemonians
and
those
ranged
in
order
by
these
were
compelled
to
go
by
a
ravine
and
along
the
mountain
side
so
while
the
lacedemonians
were
yet
going
round
those
upon
the
other
wing
were
already
beginning
the
fight
and
as
long
as
the
shields
of
the
persians
still
remained
upright
they
continued
to
defend
themselves
and
had
rather
the
advantage
in
the
fight
but
when
the
troops
of
the
athenians
and
of
those
ranged
next
to
them
desiring
that
the
achievement
should
belong
to
them
and
not
to
the
lacedemonians
with
exhortations
to
one
another
set
themselves
more
vigorously
to
the
work
then
from
that
time
forth
the
fortune
of
the
fight
was
changed
for
these
pushed
aside
the
shields
and
fell
upon
the
persians
with
a
rush
all
in
one
body
and
the
persians
sustained
their
first
attack
and
continued
to
defend
themselves
for
a
long
time
but
at
last
they
fled
to
the
wall
and
the
athenians
corinthians
sikyonians
and
troizenians
for
that
was
the
order
in
which
they
were
ranged
followed
close
after
them
and
rushed
in
together
with
them
to
the
space
within
the
wall
and
when
the
wall
too
had
been
captured
then
the
barbarians
no
longer
betook
themselves
to
resistance
but
began
at
once
to
take
flight
excepting
only
the
persians
who
formed
into
small
groups
and
continued
to
fight
with
the
hellenes
as
they
rushed
in
within
the
wall
of
the
commanders
of
the
persians
two
made
their
escape
and
two
were
slain
artaÿntes
and
ithamitres
commanders
of
the
fleet
escaped
while
mardontes
and
the
commander
of
the
tigranes
were
now
while
the
persians
were
still
fighting
the
lacedemonians
and
those
with
them
arrived
and
joined
in
carrying
through
the
rest
of
the
work
and
of
the
hellenes
themselves
many
fell
there
and
especially
many
of
the
sikyonians
together
with
their
commander
perilaos
and
those
of
the
samians
who
were
serving
in
the
army
being
in
the
camp
of
the
medes
and
having
been
deprived
of
their
arms
when
they
saw
that
from
the
very
first
the
battle
began
to
be
doubtful
did
as
much
as
they
could
endeavouring
to
give
assistance
to
the
hellenes
and
the
other
ionians
seeing
that
the
samians
had
set
the
example
themselves
also
upon
that
made
revolt
from
the
persians
and
attacked
the
the
milesians
too
had
been
appointed
to
watch
the
passes
of
the
persians
in
order
to
secure
their
safety
so
that
if
that
should
after
all
come
upon
them
which
actually
came
they
might
have
guides
and
so
get
safe
away
to
the
summits
of
mycale
milesians
i
say
had
been
appointed
to
do
this
not
only
for
that
end
but
also
for
fear
that
if
they
were
present
in
the
camp
they
might
make
some
hostile
move
but
they
did
in
fact
the
opposite
of
that
which
they
were
appointed
to
do
for
they
not
only
directed
them
in
the
flight
by
other
than
the
right
paths
by
paths
indeed
which
led
towards
the
enemy
but
also
at
last
they
themselves
became
their
worst
foes
and
began
to
slay
them
thus
then
for
the
second
time
ionia
revolted
from
the
persians
in
this
battle
of
the
hellenes
the
athenians
were
the
best
men
and
of
the
athenians
hermolycos
the
son
of
euthoinos
a
man
who
had
trained
for
the
pancration
this
hermolycos
after
these
events
when
there
was
war
between
the
athenians
and
the
carystians
was
killed
in
battle
at
kyrnos
in
the
carystian
land
near
geraistos
and
there
was
buried
after
the
athenians
the
corinthians
troizenians
and
sikyonians
were
the
best
when
the
hellenes
had
slain
the
greater
number
of
the
barbarians
some
in
the
battle
and
others
in
their
flight
they
set
fire
to
the
ships
and
to
the
whole
of
the
wall
having
first
brought
out
the
spoil
to
the
and
among
the
rest
they
found
some
stores
of
money
so
having
set
fire
to
the
wall
and
to
the
ships
they
sailed
away
and
when
they
came
to
samos
the
hellenes
deliberated
about
removing
the
inhabitants
of
ionia
and
considered
where
they
ought
to
settle
them
in
those
parts
of
hellas
of
which
they
had
command
leaving
ionia
to
the
barbarians
for
it
was
evident
to
them
that
it
was
impossible
on
the
one
hand
for
them
to
be
always
stationed
as
guards
to
protect
the
ionians
and
on
the
other
hand
if
they
were
not
stationed
to
protect
them
they
had
no
hope
that
the
ionians
would
escape
with
impunity
from
the
persians
therefore
it
seemed
good
to
those
of
the
peloponnesians
that
were
in
authority
that
they
should
remove
the
inhabitants
of
the
trading
ports
which
belonged
to
those
peoples
of
hellas
who
had
taken
the
side
of
the
medes
and
give
that
land
to
the
ionians
to
dwell
in
but
the
athenians
did
not
think
it
good
that
the
inhabitants
of
ionia
should
be
removed
at
all
nor
that
the
peloponnesians
should
consult
about
athenian
colonies
and
as
these
vehemently
resisted
the
proposal
the
peloponnesians
gave
way
so
the
end
was
that
they
joined
as
allies
to
their
league
the
samians
chians
lesbians
and
the
other
islanders
who
chanced
to
be
serving
with
the
hellenes
binding
them
by
assurance
and
by
oaths
to
remain
faithful
and
not
withdraw
from
the
league
and
having
bound
these
by
oaths
they
sailed
to
break
up
the
bridges
for
they
supposed
they
would
find
them
still
stretched
over
the
straits
these
then
were
sailing
towards
the
hellespont
and
meanwhile
those
barbarians
who
had
escaped
and
had
been
driven
to
the
heights
of
mycale
being
not
many
in
number
were
making
their
way
to
sardis
and
as
they
went
by
the
way
masistes
the
son
of
dareios
who
had
been
present
at
the
disaster
which
had
befallen
them
was
saying
many
evil
things
of
the
commander
artaÿntes
and
among
other
things
he
said
that
in
respect
of
the
generalship
which
he
had
shown
he
was
worse
than
a
woman
and
that
he
deserved
every
kind
of
evil
for
having
brought
evil
on
the
house
of
the
king
now
with
the
persians
to
be
called
worse
than
a
woman
is
the
greatest
possible
reproach
so
he
after
he
had
been
much
reviled
at
length
became
angry
and
drew
his
sword
upon
masistes
meaning
to
kill
him
and
as
he
was
running
upon
him
xeinagoras
the
son
of
prexilaos
a
man
of
halicarnassos
perceived
it
who
was
standing
just
behind
artaÿntes
and
this
man
seized
him
by
the
middle
and
lifting
him
up
dashed
him
upon
the
ground
and
meanwhile
the
spearmen
of
masistes
came
in
front
to
protect
him
thus
did
xeinagoras
and
thus
he
laid
up
thanks
for
himself
both
with
masistes
and
also
with
xerxes
for
saving
the
life
of
his
brother
and
for
this
deed
xeinagoras
became
ruler
of
all
kilikia
by
the
gift
of
the
king
nothing
further
happened
than
this
as
they
went
on
their
way
but
they
arrived
at
sardis
now
at
sardis
as
it
chanced
king
xerxes
had
been
staying
ever
since
that
time
when
he
came
thither
in
flight
from
athens
after
suffering
defeat
in
the
at
that
time
while
he
was
in
sardis
he
had
a
passionate
desire
as
it
seems
for
the
wife
of
masistes
who
was
also
there
and
as
she
could
not
be
bent
to
his
will
by
his
messages
to
her
and
he
did
not
wish
to
employ
force
because
he
had
regard
for
his
brother
masistes
and
the
same
consideration
withheld
the
woman
also
for
she
well
knew
that
force
would
not
be
used
towards
her
then
xerxes
abstained
from
all
else
and
endeavoured
to
bring
about
the
marriage
of
his
own
son
dareios
with
the
daughter
of
this
woman
and
of
masistes
supposing
that
if
he
should
do
so
he
would
obtain
her
more
easily
then
having
made
the
betrothal
and
done
all
the
customary
rites
he
went
away
to
susa
and
when
he
had
arrived
there
and
had
brought
the
woman
into
his
own
house
for
dareios
then
he
ceased
from
attempting
the
wife
of
masistes
and
changing
his
inclination
he
conceived
a
desire
for
the
wife
of
dareios
who
was
daughter
of
masistes
and
obtained
her
now
the
name
of
this
woman
was
however
as
time
went
on
this
became
known
in
the
following
manner
the
wife
of
xerxes
had
woven
a
mantle
large
and
of
various
work
and
a
sight
worthy
to
be
seen
and
this
she
gave
to
xerxes
he
then
being
greatly
pleased
put
it
on
and
went
to
artaÿnte
and
being
greatly
pleased
with
her
too
he
bade
her
ask
what
she
would
to
be
given
to
her
in
return
for
the
favours
which
she
had
granted
to
him
for
she
should
obtain
he
said
whatsoever
she
asked
and
she
since
it
was
destined
that
she
should
perish
miserably
with
her
whole
house
said
to
xerxes
upon
this
wilt
thou
give
me
whatsoever
i
ask
thee
for
and
he
supposing
that
she
would
ask
anything
rather
than
that
which
she
did
promised
this
and
swore
to
it
then
when
he
had
sworn
she
boldly
asked
for
the
mantle
and
xerxes
tried
every
means
of
persuasion
not
being
willing
to
give
it
to
her
and
that
for
no
other
reason
but
only
because
he
feared
amestris
lest
by
her
who
even
before
this
had
some
inkling
of
the
truth
he
should
thus
be
discovered
in
the
act
and
he
offered
her
cities
and
gold
in
any
quantity
and
an
army
which
no
one
else
should
command
except
herself
now
this
of
an
army
is
a
thoroughly
persian
gift
since
however
he
did
not
persuade
her
he
gave
her
the
mantle
and
she
being
overjoyed
by
the
gift
wore
it
and
prided
herself
upon
and
amestris
was
informed
that
she
had
it
and
having
learnt
that
which
was
being
done
she
was
not
angry
with
the
woman
but
supposing
that
her
mother
was
the
cause
and
that
she
was
bringing
this
about
she
planned
destruction
for
the
wife
of
masistes
she
waited
then
until
her
husband
xerxes
had
a
royal
feast
set
before
him
feast
is
served
up
once
in
the
year
on
the
day
on
which
the
king
was
born
and
the
name
of
this
feast
is
in
persian
tycta
which
in
the
tongue
of
the
hellenes
means
complete
also
on
this
occasion
alone
the
king
washes
his
head
and
he
makes
gifts
then
to
the
persians
i
say
waited
for
this
day
and
then
asked
of
xerxes
that
the
wife
of
masistes
might
be
given
to
her
and
he
considered
it
a
strange
and
untoward
thing
to
deliver
over
to
her
his
brother
wife
especially
since
she
was
innocent
of
this
matter
for
he
understood
why
she
was
making
the
at
last
however
as
she
continued
to
entreat
urgently
and
he
was
compelled
by
the
rule
namely
that
it
is
impossible
among
them
that
he
who
makes
request
when
a
royal
feast
is
laid
before
the
king
should
fail
to
obtain
it
at
last
very
much
against
his
will
consented
and
in
delivering
her
up
he
bade
amestris
do
as
she
desired
and
meanwhile
he
sent
for
his
brother
and
said
these
words
masistes
thou
art
the
son
of
dareios
and
my
brother
and
moreover
in
addition
to
this
thou
art
a
man
of
worth
i
say
to
thee
live
no
longer
with
this
wife
with
whom
thou
now
livest
but
i
give
thee
instead
of
her
my
daughter
with
her
live
as
thy
wife
but
the
wife
whom
thou
now
hast
do
not
keep
for
it
does
not
seem
good
to
me
that
thou
shouldest
keep
her
masistes
then
marvelling
at
that
which
was
spoken
said
these
words
master
how
unprofitable
a
speech
is
this
which
thou
utterest
to
me
in
that
thou
biddest
me
send
away
a
wife
by
whom
i
have
sons
who
are
grown
up
to
be
young
men
and
daughters
one
of
whom
even
thou
thyself
didst
take
as
a
wife
for
thy
son
and
who
is
herself
as
it
chances
very
much
to
my
mind
thou
biddest
me
i
say
send
away
her
and
take
to
wife
thy
daughter
i
o
king
think
it
a
very
great
matter
that
i
am
judged
worthy
of
thy
daughter
but
nevertheless
i
will
do
neither
of
these
things
and
do
not
thou
urge
me
by
force
to
do
such
a
thing
as
this
but
for
thy
daughter
another
husband
will
be
found
not
in
any
wise
inferior
to
me
and
let
me
i
pray
thee
live
still
with
my
own
wife
he
returned
answer
in
some
such
words
as
these
and
xerxes
being
stirred
with
anger
said
as
follows
this
then
masistes
is
thy
case
will
not
give
thee
my
daughter
for
thy
wife
nor
yet
shalt
thou
live
any
longer
with
that
one
in
order
that
thou
mayest
learn
to
accept
that
which
is
offered
thee
he
then
when
he
heard
this
went
out
having
first
said
these
words
master
thou
hast
not
surely
brought
ruin
upon
me
during
this
interval
of
time
while
xerxes
was
conversing
with
his
brother
amestris
had
sent
the
spearmen
of
xerxes
to
bring
the
wife
of
masistes
and
she
was
doing
to
her
shameful
outrage
for
she
cut
away
her
breasts
and
threw
them
to
dogs
and
she
cut
off
her
nose
and
ears
and
lips
and
tongue
and
sent
her
back
home
thus
outraged
then
masistes
not
yet
having
heard
any
of
these
things
but
supposing
that
some
evil
had
fallen
upon
him
came
running
to
his
house
and
seeing
his
wife
thus
mutilated
forthwith
upon
this
he
took
counsel
with
his
sons
and
set
forth
to
go
to
bactria
together
with
his
sons
and
doubtless
some
others
also
meaning
to
make
the
province
of
bactria
revolt
and
to
do
the
greatest
possible
injury
to
the
king
and
this
in
fact
would
have
come
to
pass
as
i
imagine
if
he
had
got
up
to
the
land
of
the
bactrians
and
sacans
before
he
was
overtaken
for
they
were
much
attached
to
him
and
also
he
was
the
governor
of
the
bactrians
but
xerxes
being
informed
that
he
was
doing
this
sent
after
him
an
army
as
he
was
on
his
way
and
slew
both
him
and
his
sons
and
his
army
so
far
of
that
which
happened
about
the
passion
of
xerxes
and
the
death
of
masistes
now
the
hellenes
who
had
set
forth
from
mycale
to
the
hellespont
first
moored
their
ships
about
lecton
being
stopped
from
their
voyage
by
winds
and
thence
they
came
to
abydos
and
found
that
the
bridges
had
been
broken
up
which
they
thought
to
find
still
stretched
across
and
on
account
of
which
especially
they
had
come
to
the
hellespont
so
the
peloponnesians
which
leotychides
resolved
to
sail
back
to
hellas
while
the
athenians
and
xanthippos
their
commander
determined
to
stay
behind
there
and
to
make
an
attempt
upon
the
chersonese
those
then
sailed
away
and
the
athenians
passed
over
from
abydos
to
the
chersonese
and
began
to
besiege
to
this
town
of
sestos
since
it
was
the
greatest
stronghold
of
those
in
that
region
men
had
come
together
from
the
cities
which
lay
round
it
when
they
heard
that
the
hellenes
had
arrived
at
the
hellespont
and
especially
there
had
come
from
the
city
of
cardia
oiobazos
a
persian
who
had
brought
to
sestos
the
ropes
of
the
bridges
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
were
aiolians
natives
of
the
country
but
there
were
living
with
them
a
great
number
of
persians
and
also
of
their
and
of
the
province
artaÿctes
was
despot
as
governor
under
xerxes
a
persian
but
a
man
of
desperate
and
reckless
character
who
also
had
practised
deception
upon
the
king
on
his
march
against
athens
in
taking
away
from
elaius
the
things
belonging
to
protesilaos
the
son
of
iphiclos
for
at
elaius
in
the
chersonese
there
is
the
tomb
of
protesilaos
with
a
sacred
enclosure
about
it
where
there
were
many
treasures
with
gold
and
silver
cups
and
bronze
and
raiment
and
other
offerings
which
things
artaÿctes
carried
off
as
plunder
the
king
having
granted
them
to
him
and
he
deceived
xerxes
by
saying
to
him
some
such
words
as
these
master
there
is
here
the
house
of
a
man
a
hellene
who
made
an
expedition
against
thy
land
and
met
with
his
deserts
and
was
slain
this
man
house
i
ask
thee
to
give
to
me
that
every
one
may
learn
not
to
make
expeditions
against
thy
land
by
saying
this
it
was
likely
that
he
would
easily
enough
persuade
xerxes
to
give
him
a
man
house
not
suspecting
what
was
in
his
mind
and
when
he
said
that
protesilaos
had
made
expedition
against
the
land
of
the
king
it
must
be
understood
that
the
persians
consider
all
asia
to
be
theirs
and
to
belong
to
their
reigning
king
so
when
the
things
had
been
given
him
he
brought
them
from
elaius
to
sestos
and
he
sowed
the
sacred
enclosure
for
crops
and
occupied
it
as
his
own
and
he
himself
whenever
he
came
to
elaius
had
commerce
with
women
in
the
inner
cell
of
the
temple
and
now
he
was
being
besieged
by
the
athenians
when
he
had
not
made
any
preparation
for
a
siege
nor
had
been
expecting
that
the
hellenes
would
come
for
they
fell
upon
him
as
one
may
say
inevitably
when
however
autumn
came
and
the
siege
still
went
on
the
athenians
began
to
be
vexed
at
being
absent
from
their
own
land
and
at
the
same
time
not
able
to
conquer
the
fortress
and
they
requested
their
commanders
to
lead
them
away
home
but
these
said
that
they
would
not
do
so
until
either
they
had
taken
the
town
or
the
public
authority
of
the
athenians
sent
for
them
home
and
so
they
endured
their
present
state
those
however
who
were
within
the
walls
had
now
come
to
the
greatest
misery
so
that
they
boiled
down
the
girths
of
their
beds
and
used
them
for
food
and
when
they
no
longer
had
even
these
then
the
persians
and
with
them
artaÿctes
and
oiobazos
ran
away
and
departed
in
the
night
climbing
down
by
the
back
part
of
the
wall
where
the
place
was
left
most
unguarded
by
the
enemy
and
when
day
came
the
men
of
the
chersonese
signified
to
the
athenians
from
the
towers
concerning
that
which
had
happened
and
opened
the
gates
to
them
so
the
greater
number
of
them
went
in
pursuit
and
the
rest
occupied
the
now
oiobazos
as
he
was
escaping
into
thrace
was
caught
by
the
apsinthian
thracians
and
sacrificed
to
their
native
god
pleistoros
with
their
rites
and
the
rest
who
were
with
him
they
slaughtered
in
another
manner
but
artaÿctes
with
his
companions
who
started
on
their
flight
later
and
were
overtaken
at
a
little
distance
above
aigospotamoi
defended
themselves
for
a
considerable
time
and
were
some
of
them
killed
and
others
taken
alive
and
the
hellenes
had
bound
these
and
were
bringing
them
to
sestos
and
among
them
artaÿctes
also
in
bonds
together
with
his
then
it
is
said
by
the
men
of
the
chersonese
as
one
of
those
who
guarded
them
was
frying
dried
fish
a
portent
occurred
as
follows
dried
fish
when
laid
upon
the
fire
began
to
leap
and
struggle
just
as
if
they
were
fish
newly
caught
and
the
others
gathered
round
and
were
marvelling
at
the
portent
but
artaÿctes
seeing
it
called
to
the
man
who
was
frying
the
fish
and
said
stranger
of
athens
be
not
at
all
afraid
of
this
portent
seeing
that
it
has
not
appeared
for
thee
but
for
me
protesilaos
who
dwells
at
elaius
signifies
thereby
that
though
he
is
dead
and
his
body
is
dried
like
those
fish
yet
he
has
power
given
him
by
the
gods
to
exact
vengeance
from
the
man
who
does
him
wrong
now
therefore
i
desire
to
impose
this
penalty
for
him
in
place
of
the
things
which
i
took
from
the
temple
i
should
pay
down
a
hundred
talents
to
the
god
and
moreover
as
ransom
for
myself
and
my
son
i
will
pay
two
hundred
talents
to
the
athenians
if
my
life
be
spared
thus
he
engaged
to
do
but
he
did
not
prevail
upon
the
commander
xanthippos
for
the
people
of
elaius
desiring
to
take
vengeance
for
protesilaos
asked
that
he
might
be
put
to
death
and
the
inclination
of
the
commander
himself
tended
to
the
same
conclusion
they
brought
him
therefore
to
that
headland
to
which
xerxes
made
the
passage
across
or
as
some
say
to
the
hill
which
is
over
the
town
of
madytos
and
there
they
nailed
him
to
boards
and
hung
him
up
and
they
stoned
his
son
to
death
before
the
eyes
of
artaÿctes
having
so
done
they
sailed
away
to
hellas
taking
with
them
besides
other
things
the
ropes
also
of
the
bridges
in
order
to
dedicate
them
as
offerings
in
the
temples
and
for
that
year
nothing
happened
further
than
this
now
a
forefather
of
this
artaÿctes
who
was
hung
up
was
that
artembares
who
set
forth
to
the
persians
a
proposal
which
they
took
up
and
brought
before
cyrus
being
to
this
effect
seeing
that
zeus
grants
to
the
persians
leadership
and
of
all
men
to
thee
o
cyrus
by
destroying
astyages
come
since
the
land
we
possess
is
small
and
also
rugged
let
us
change
from
it
and
inhabit
another
which
is
better
and
there
are
many
near
at
hand
and
many
also
at
a
greater
distance
of
which
if
we
take
one
we
shall
have
greater
reverence
and
from
more
men
it
is
reasonable
too
that
men
who
are
rulers
should
do
such
things
for
when
will
there
ever
be
a
fairer
occasion
than
now
when
we
are
rulers
of
many
nations
and
of
the
whole
of
asia
cyrus
hearing
this
and
not
being
surprised
at
the
proposal
bade
them
do
so
if
they
would
but
he
exhorted
them
and
bade
them
prepare
in
that
case
to
be
no
longer
rulers
but
subjects
for
said
he
from
lands
which
are
not
rugged
men
who
are
not
rugged
are
apt
to
come
forth
since
it
does
not
belong
to
the
same
land
to
bring
forth
fruits
of
the
earth
which
are
admirable
and
also
men
who
are
good
in
war
so
the
persians
acknowledged
that
he
was
right
and
departed
from
his
presence
having
their
opinion
defeated
by
that
of
cyrus
and
they
chose
rather
to
dwell
on
poor
land
and
be
rulers
than
to
sow
crops
in
