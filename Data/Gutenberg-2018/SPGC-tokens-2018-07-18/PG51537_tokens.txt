by
all

most
war
and
this
sweet
lady
the
last
day
of
october
in
colonel
jonathan
hamilton
came
out
of
his
high
house
on
the
river
bank
with
a
handsome
impatient
company
of
guests
all
berwick
gentlemen
they
stood
on
the
flagstones
watching
a
coming
boat
that
was
just
within
sight
under
the
shadow
of
the
pines
of
the
farther
shore
and
eagerly
passed
from
hand
to
hand
a
spyglass
covered
with
worn
red
morocco
leather
the
sun
had
just
gone
down
the
dusk
of
the
short
day
was
already
veiling
the
sky
before
they
could
see
the
steady
lift
and
dip
of
long
oars
and
make
sure
of
the
boat
s
company
while
it
was
still
a
long
distance
away
the
gentlemen
turned
westward
and
went
slowly
down
through
the
terraced
garden
to
wait
again
with
much
formality
by
the
gate
at
the
garden
foot
beside
the
master
of
the
house
was
judge
chadbourne
an
old
man
of
singular
dignity
and
kindliness
of
look
and
near
them
stood
general
goodwin
owner
of
the
next
estate
and
major
tilly
haggens
of
the
indian
wars
a
tall
heavily
made
person
clumsily
built
but
not
without
a
certain
elegance
like
an
old
bottle
of
burgundy
there
was
a
small
group
behind
these
foremost
men
red
cloak
here
and
a
touch
of
dark
velvet
on
a
shoulder
beyond
with
plenty
of
ruffles
to
grace
the
wearers
hamilton
s
young
associate
john
lord
merchant
and
gentleman
stood
alone
and
serious
with
a
look
of
discretion
almost
too
great
for
his
natural
boyish
grace
quite
the
most
impressive
figure
among
them
was
the
minister
a
man
of
high
ecclesiastical
lineage
very
well
dressed
in
a
beaver
hat
a
large
coat
sweeping
down
with
ample
curves
over
a
long
waistcoat
with
huge
pockets
and
lappets
and
a
great
white
stock
that
held
his
chin
high
in
air
this
was
fastened
behind
with
a
silver
buckle
to
match
the
buckles
on
his
tight
knee
breeches
and
other
buckles
large
and
flat
on
his
shoes
somehow
he
looked
as
like
a
serious
book
with
clasps
as
a
man
could
look
with
an
outward
completeness
that
mated
with
his
inner
equipment
of
fixed
arminian
opinions
as
for
colonel
hamilton
the
host
a
man
in
the
middle
thirties
the
softness
of
a
suit
of
brown
and
his
own
hair
well
dressed
and
powdered
did
not
lessen
a
certain
hardness
in
his
face
a
grave
determination
and
maturity
of
appearance
far
beyond
the
due
of
his
years
hamilton
had
easily
enough
won
the
place
of
chief
shipping
merchant
and
prince
of
in
that
respectable
group
and
until
these
dark
days
of
war
almost
every
venture
by
land
or
sea
had
added
to
his
fortunes
the
noble
house
that
he
had
built
was
still
new
enough
to
be
the
chief
show
and
glory
of
a
rich
provincial
neighborhood
with
all
his
power
of
there
were
those
who
counted
him
a
second
sir
william
pepperrell
was
no
easy
like
that
great
citizen
of
the
district
of
maine
nor
even
like
his
own
beautiful
younger
sister
the
house
s
mistress
some
strain
of
good
blood
which
they
had
inherited
seemed
to
have
been
saved
through
generations
to
nourish
this
one
lovely
existence
and
make
her
seem
like
the
single
flower
upon
their
family
tree
they
had
come
from
but
a
meagre
childhood
to
live
here
in
state
and
luxury
beside
the
river
the
broad
green
fields
of
hamilton
s
estate
climbed
a
long
hill
behind
the
house
hedged
in
by
stately
rows
of
elms
and
tufted
by
young
orchards
at
the
western
side
a
strong
mountain
stream
came
down
its
deep
channel
over
noisy
falls
and
rapids
to
meet
the
salt
tide
in
the
bay
below
this
broad
sea
inlet
and
inland
harborage
was
too
well
filled
in
an
anxious
year
with
freightless
vessels
both
small
and
great
heavy
seagoing
craft
and
gundalows
for
the
river
traffic
idle
enough
now
and
careened
on
the
mud
at
half
tide
in
picturesque
confusion
the
opposite
shore
was
high
with
farmhouses
above
the
fields
there
were
many
persons
to
be
seen
coming
down
toward
the
water
and
when
colonel
hamilton
and
his
guests
appeared
on
the
garden
terraces
a
loud
cry
went
alongshore
and
instantly
the
noise
of
mallets
ceased
in
the
shipyard
beyond
where
some
carpenters
were
late
at
work
there
was
an
eager
buzzing
crowd
growing
fast
about
the
boat
landing
and
the
wharf
and
warehouses
which
the
gentlemen
at
the
gateway
looked
down
upon
the
boat
was
coming
up
steadily
but
in
the
middle
distance
it
seemed
to
lag
the
long
stretch
of
water
was
greater
than
could
be
measured
by
the
eye
two
west
indian
fellows
in
the
crowd
fell
to
scuffling
having
trodden
upon
each
other
s
rights
and
the
quickly
diverted
from
their
first
interest
cheered
them
on
and
wedged
themselves
closer
together
to
see
the
fun
old
cæsar
the
majestic
negro
who
had
attended
hamilton
at
respectful
distance
made
it
his
welcome
duty
to
approach
the
quarrel
with
loud
rebukes
usually
the
authority
of
this
great
person
in
matters
pertaining
to
the
estate
was
only
second
to
his
master
s
but
in
such
a
moment
of
high
festival
and
gladiatorial
combat
all
commands
fell
upon
deaf
ears
major
tilly
haggens
burst
into
a
hearty
laugh
glad
of
a
chance
to
break
the
tiresome
formalities
of
his
associates
and
being
a
great
admirer
of
a
skillful
fight
on
any
serious
occasion
the
major
always
seemed
a
little
uneasy
as
if
restless
with
unspoken
jokes
in
the
meantime
the
boat
had
taken
its
shoreward
curve
and
was
now
so
near
that
even
through
the
dusk
the
figures
of
the
oarsmen
and
of
an
officer
sitting
alone
at
the
stern
in
full
uniform
could
be
plainly
seen
the
next
moment
the
wrestling
tobago
men
sprang
to
their
feet
forgetting
their
affront
and
ran
to
the
with
the
rest
the
new
flag
of
the
congress
with
its
unfamiliar
stripes
was
trailing
at
the
boat
s
stern
the
officer
bore
himself
with
dignity
and
made
his
salutations
with
much
politeness
all
the
gentlemen
on
the
terrace
came
down
together
to
the
water
s
edge
without
haste
but
with
exact
deference
and
timeliness
the
officer
rose
quickly
in
the
boat
and
stepped
ashore
with
ready
foot
and
no
undignified
loss
of
balance
he
wore
the
pleased
look
of
a
willing
guest
and
was
gayly
dressed
in
a
bright
new
uniform
of
blue
coat
and
breeches
with
red
lapels
and
a
red
waistcoat
trimmed
with
lace
there
was
a
noisy
cheering
and
the
spectators
fell
back
on
either
hand
and
made
way
for
this
very
elegant
company
to
turn
again
and
go
their
ways
up
the
river
shore
captain
paul
jones
of
the
ranger
bowed
as
a
sovereign
might
as
he
walked
along
a
little
stiffly
at
first
being
often
vexed
by
as
he
now
explained
cheerfully
to
his
host
there
was
an
eager
restless
look
in
his
sailor
s
face
with
quick
eyes
that
seemed
not
to
observe
things
that
were
near
by
but
to
look
often
and
hopefully
toward
the
horizon
he
was
a
small
man
but
already
bent
in
the
shoulders
from
living
between
decks
his
sword
was
long
for
his
height
and
touched
the
ground
as
he
walked
dragging
along
a
gathered
handful
of
fallen
poplar
leaves
with
its
scabbard
tip
it
was
growing
dark
as
they
went
up
the
long
garden
a
thin
white
mist
was
gathering
on
the
river
and
blurred
the
fields
where
there
were
marshy
spots
or
springs
the
two
brigs
at
the
moorings
had
strung
up
their
dull
oil
lanterns
to
the
rigging
where
they
twinkled
like
setting
stars
and
made
faint
reflections
below
in
the
rippling
current
the
huge
elms
that
stood
along
the
river
shore
were
full
of
shadows
while
above
the
large
house
was
growing
bright
with
candlelight
and
taking
on
a
cheerful
air
of
invitation
as
the
master
and
his
friends
went
up
to
the
wide
south
door
there
stepped
out
to
meet
them
the
lovely
figure
of
a
girl
tall
and
charming
and
ready
with
a
gay
welcome
to
chide
the
captain
for
his
delay
she
spoke
affectionately
to
each
of
the
others
though
she
avoided
young
lord
s
beseeching
eyes
the
elder
men
had
hardly
time
for
a
second
look
to
reassure
themselves
of
her
bright
beauty
before
she
had
vanished
along
the
lighted
hall
by
the
time
their
cocked
hats
and
plainer
head
gear
were
safely
deposited
old
cæsar
with
a
great
flourish
of
invitation
had
thrown
open
the
door
of
the
dining
parlor
parting
a
little
nation
but
made
great
by
liberty
the
faces
gathered
about
the
table
were
serious
and
full
of
character
they
wore
the
look
of
men
who
would
lay
down
their
lives
for
the
young
country
whose
sons
they
were
and
though
provincial
enough
for
the
most
part
so
looked
most
of
the
men
who
sat
in
parliament
at
westminster
and
there
was
no
more
patrician
head
than
the
old
judge
s
to
be
seen
upon
the
english
bench
they
were
for
no
in
public
matters
but
conscious
in
their
hearts
of
some
national
ideas
that
a
greek
might
have
cherished
in
his
clear
brain
or
any
citizen
of
the
great
days
of
rome
they
were
men
of
a
faith
in
liberty
that
shone
bright
and
unassailable
there
were
men
as
good
as
they
in
a
hundred
other
towns
it
was
a
simple
senate
of
new
england
ready
and
able
to
serve
her
cause
in
small
things
and
great
the
next
moment
after
the
minister
had
said
a
proper
grace
the
old
judge
had
a
question
to
ask
where
is
miss
mary
hamilton
said
he
shall
we
not
have
the
pleasure
of
her
company
my
sister
looks
for
some
young
friends
later
explained
the
host
but
with
a
touch
of
coldness
in
his
voice
she
begs
us
to
join
her
then
in
her
knowing
that
we
are
now
likely
to
have
business
together
and
much
discussion
of
public
affairs
i
bid
you
all
welcome
to
my
table
gentlemen
may
we
be
here
to
greet
captain
paul
jones
on
his
glorious
return
as
we
speed
him
now
on
so
high
an
errand
you
have
made
your
house
very
pleasant
to
a
homeless
man
colonel
hamilton
returned
the
captain
with
great
feeling
and
miss
hamilton
is
as
good
a
patriot
as
her
generous
brother
may
massachusetts
and
the
province
of
maine
never
lack
such
sons
and
daughters
there
are
many
of
my
men
taking
their
farewell
supper
on
either
shore
of
your
river
this
night
i
have
received
my
dispatches
and
it
is
settled
that
we
sail
for
france
morning
at
the
turn
of
tide
morning
they
exclaimed
in
chorus
the
captain
s
manner
gave
the
best
of
news
there
was
an
instant
shout
of
approval
and
congratulation
his
own
satisfaction
at
being
finally
ordered
to
sea
after
many
trying
delays
was
understood
by
every
one
since
for
many
months
while
the
ranger
was
on
the
stocks
at
portsmouth
paul
jones
had
bitterly
lamented
the
indecisions
of
a
young
government
and
regretted
the
slipping
away
of
great
opportunities
abroad
and
at
home
to
say
that
he
had
made
himself
as
vexing
as
a
wasp
were
to
say
the
truth
but
he
had
already
proved
himself
a
born
leader
with
a
heart
on
fire
with
patriotism
and
deep
desire
for
glory
and
there
were
those
present
who
eagerly
recognized
his
power
and
were
ready
to
further
his
best
endeavors
young
men
had
flocked
to
his
side
sailors
born
and
bred
on
the
river
shores
and
in
portsmouth
town
who
could
serve
their
country
well
berwick
was
in
the
thick
of
the
fight
from
the
very
beginning
her
company
of
soldiers
had
been
among
the
first
at
bunker
s
hill
and
the
alarm
at
lexington
had
shaken
her
very
hills
at
home
twin
sister
of
portsmouth
in
age
and
sharer
of
her
worldly
conditions
the
old
ease
and
wealth
of
the
town
were
sadly
troubled
now
there
was
many
a
new
black
gown
in
the
parson
s
great
parish
and
many
a
mother
s
son
lay
dead
or
suffered
in
an
english
prison
yet
the
sea
still
beckoned
with
white
hands
and
paul
jones
might
have
shipped
his
crew
on
the
river
many
times
over
the
ease
of
teaching
england
to
let
the
colonies
alone
was
not
spoken
of
with
such
bold
certainty
as
at
first
and
some
late
offenses
were
believed
to
be
best
revenged
by
such
a
voyage
as
the
ranger
was
about
to
make
captain
paul
jones
knew
his
work
he
was
full
of
righteous
wrath
toward
england
and
professed
a
large
readiness
to
accept
the
offered
friendliness
of
france
colonel
jonathan
hamilton
could
entertain
like
a
prince
the
feast
was
fit
for
the
room
in
which
it
was
served
and
the
huge
cellar
beneath
was
well
stored
with
casks
of
wine
that
had
come
from
france
and
spain
or
from
england
while
her
ports
were
still
home
ports
for
the
colonies
being
a
scotsman
the
guest
of
honor
was
not
unmindful
of
excellent
claret
and
now
set
down
his
fluted
silver
tumbler
after
a
first
deep
draught
and
paid
his
host
a
handsome
compliment
you
live
like
a
virginia
gentleman
sir
here
in
your
northern
home
they
little
know
in
great
britain
what
stately
living
is
among
us
the
noble
countess
of
selkirk
thought
that
i
was
come
to
live
among
the
savages
instead
of
gratifying
my
wishes
for
that
calm
contemplation
and
poetic
ease
which
alas
i
have
ever
been
denied
they
affect
to
wonder
at
the
existence
of
american
gentlemen
returned
the
judge
when
my
father
went
to
court
in
and
they
hinted
the
like
he
reminded
them
that
since
they
had
sent
over
some
of
the
best
of
their
own
gentlefolk
to
found
the
colonies
it
would
be
strange
if
none
but
boors
and
clowns
came
back
in
virginia
they
consider
that
they
breed
the
only
gentlemen
that
is
the
great
pity
said
parson
tompson
some
of
my
classmates
at
cambridge
arrived
at
college
with
far
too
proud
a
spirit
they
were
pleased
to
be
amused
at
first
because
so
many
of
us
at
the
north
were
destined
for
the
ministry
you
will
remember
that
don
quixote
speaks
of
the
church
the
sea
and
the
court
for
his
spanish
gentlemen
said
major
tilly
haggens
casting
a
glance
across
at
the
old
judge
we
have
had
the
two
first
to
choose
from

if
we
lacked
the
third
the
world
was
much
with
the
major
and
he
was
nothing
if
not
eager
spoken
people
forget
to
look
at
the
antecedents
of
our
various
colonists
t
is
the
only
way
to
understand
them
in
these
piscataqua
neighborhoods
we
do
not
differ
so
much
from
those
of
virginia
tis
not
the
same
pious
stock
as
made
connecticut
and
the
settlements
of
massachusetts
bay
we
are
children
of
the
norman
blood
in
new
england
and
virginia
at
any
rate
t
is
the
saxons
who
try
to
rule
england
now
there
is
the
cause
of
all
our
troubles
norman
and
saxon
have
never
yet
learned
to
agree
you
give
me
a
new
thought
said
the
captain
for
me
explained
the
major
i
am
of
fighting
and
praying
huguenot
blood
and
here
comes
in
another
strain
to
our
nation
s
making
i
might
have
been
a
parson
myself
if
there
had
not
been
a
stray
french
gallant
to
my
grandfather
who
ran
away
with
a
saintly
huguenot
maiden
his
ghost
still
walks
by
night
and
puts
the
devil
into
me
so
that
i
forget
my
decent
hymns
my
family
name
is
huyghens
t
was
a
noble
house
of
the
low
countries
christian
huyghens
author
of
the
cosmotheoros
was
my
father
s
kinsman
and
i
was
christened
for
the
famous
general
tilly
of
stern
faith
but
the
gay
frenchman
will
ever
rule
me
tis
all
settled
by
our
antecedents
and
he
turned
to
captain
paul
jones
i
m
for
the
sir
if
i
were
a
younger
man
i
d
sail
with
you
t
is
very
hard
for
us
aging
men
with
boys
hearts
in
us
to
stay
decently
at
home
i
should
have
been
born
in
france
france
is
your
country
s
friend
sir
said
paul
jones
bowing
across
the
table
let
us
drink
to
france
gentlemen
and
the
company
drank
the
toast
old
cæsar
bowed
with
the
rest
as
he
stood
behind
his
master
s
chair
and
smacked
his
lips
with
pathetic
relish
of
the
wine
which
he
had
tasted
only
in
imagination
the
captain
s
quick
eyes
caught
sight
of
him
by
your
leave
colonel
hamilton
he
exclaimed
heartily
this
is
a
toast
that
every
american
should
share
the
pleasure
of
drinking
i
observe
that
my
old
friend
cæsar
has
joined
us
in
spirit
and
he
turned
with
a
courtly
bow
and
gave
a
glass
to
the
serving
man
you
have
as
much
at
stake
as
we
in
this
great
enterprise
he
said
gently
in
a
tone
that
moved
the
hearts
of
all
the
supper
company
may
i
drink
with
you
to
france
our
country
s
ally
a
lesser
soul
might
have
babbled
thanks
but
cæsar
who
had
been
born
a
guinea
prince
drank
in
silence
stepped
back
to
his
place
behind
his
master
and
stood
there
like
a
king
his
underlings
went
and
came
serving
the
supper
he
ruled
them
like
a
great
commander
on
the
field
of
battle
and
hardly
demeaned
himself
to
move
again
until
the
board
was
cleared
i
seldom
see
a
black
face
without
remembering
the
worst
of
my
boyish
days
when
i
sailed
in
the
two
friends
slaver
said
the
captain
gravely
but
with
easy
power
of
continuance
our
neighbor
town
of
dumfries
was
in
the
tobacco
trade
and
all
their
cargoes
were
unloaded
in
carsethorn
bay
close
by
my
father
s
house
i
was
easily
enough
tempted
to
follow
the
sea
i
was
trading
in
the
betsey
at
seventeen
and
felt
myself
a
man
of
experience
i
have
observed
too
many
idle
young
lads
hanging
about
your
portsmouth
wharves
who
ought
to
be
put
to
sea
under
a
smart
captain
they
are
ready
to
cheer
or
to
jeer
at
strangers
and
take
no
pains
to
be
manly
i
began
to
follow
the
sea
when
i
was
but
a
child
yet
i
was
always
ambitious
of
command
and
ever
thinking
how
i
might
best
study
the
art
of
navigation
there
were
few
idlers
along
this
river
once
said
general
goodwin
regretfully
the
times
grow
worse
and
worse
you
referred
to
the
slaver
two
friends
interrupted
the
minister
who
had
seen
a
shadow
of
disapproval
on
the
faces
of
two
of
his
parishioners
one
being
colonel
hamilton
s
at
the
captain
s
tone
may
i
observe
that
there
has
seemed
to
be
some
manifestation
of
a
kind
providence
in
bringing
so
many
heathen
souls
to
the
influence
of
a
christian
country
the
fierce
temper
of
the
captain
flamed
to
his
face
he
looked
up
at
old
cæsar
who
well
remembered
the
passage
from
his
native
land
and
saw
that
black
countenance
set
like
an
iron
mask
i
must
beg
your
reverence
s
kind
pardon
if
i
contradict
you
said
paul
jones
with
scornful
bitterness
there
was
a
murmur
of
protest
about
the
table
the
captain
s
reply
was
not
counted
to
be
in
the
best
of
taste
society
resents
being
disturbed
at
its
pleasures
and
the
man
who
had
offended
was
now
made
conscious
of
his
rudeness
he
looked
up
however
and
saw
miss
hamilton
standing
near
the
open
doorway
that
led
into
the
hall
she
was
gazing
at
him
with
no
relic
of
that
indifference
which
had
lately
distressed
his
heart
and
smiled
at
him
as
she
colored
deeply
and
disappeared
the
captain
took
on
a
more
spirited
manner
than
before
and
began
to
speak
of
politics
of
the
late
news
from
long
island
where
a
son
of
old
berwick
general
john
sullivan
had
taken
the
place
of
lee
and
was
now
next
in
command
to
washington
himself
this
night
paul
jones
seemed
to
be
in
no
danger
of
those
fierce
outbursts
of
temper
with
which
he
was
apt
to
startle
his
more
amiable
and
prosaic
companions
there
was
some
discussion
of
immediate
affairs
and
one
of
the
company
wentworth
fell
upon
the
inevitable
subject
of
the
tories
a
topic
sure
to
rouse
much
bitterness
of
feeling
whatever
his
own
principles
every
man
present
had
some
tie
of
friendship
or
bond
of
kindred
with
those
who
were
loyalists
for
conscience
sake
and
could
easily
be
made
ill
at
ease
the
moment
seemed
peculiarly
unfortunate
for
such
trespass
and
when
there
came
an
angry
lull
in
the
storm
of
talk
lord
somewhat
anxiously
called
attention
to
a
pair
of
great
silver
candlesticks
which
graced
the
feast
and
by
way
of
compliment
begged
to
be
told
their
history
it
was
not
unknown
that
they
had
been
brought
from
england
a
few
summers
before
in
one
of
hamilton
s
own
ships
and
that
he
was
not
without
his
fancy
for
such
things
as
gave
his
house
a
look
of
rich
ancestry
a
stranger
might
well
have
thought
himself
in
a
good
country
house
of
queen
anne
s
time
near
london
but
this
placid
interlude
did
not
rouse
any
genuine
interest
and
old
judge
chadbourne
broke
another
awkward
pause
and
harked
back
to
safer
ground
in
the
conversation
i
shall
hereafter
make
some
discrimination
against
men
of
color
i
have
suffered
a
great
trial
of
the
spirit
this
day
he
began
seriously
i
ask
the
kind
sympathy
of
each
friend
present
i
had
promised
my
friend
president
hancock
some
of
our
berwick
elms
to
plant
near
his
house
on
boston
common
he
has
much
admired
the
fine
natural
growth
of
that
tree
in
our
good
town
here
and
the
beauty
it
lends
to
our
high
ridges
of
land
i
gave
directions
to
my
man
ajax
known
to
some
of
you
as
a
competent
but
lazy
soul
and
as
i
was
leaving
home
he
ran
after
me
shouting
to
inquire
where
he
should
find
the
trees
oh
get
them
anywhere
said
i
impatient
at
the
detention
and
full
of
some
difficult
matters
which
were
coming
up
at
our
term
in
york
and
this
morning
on
my
return
from
court
i
missed
a
row
of
young
elms
which
i
had
selected
myself
and
planted
along
the
outer
border
of
my
gardens
ajax
had
taken
the
most
accessible
and
they
had
all
gone
down
river
by
the
packet
i
shall
have
a
good
laugh
with
hancock
by
and
by
i
remember
that
he
once
praised
these
very
trees
and
professed
to
covet
them
t
was
the
evil
eye
suggested
hill
laughing
but
the
minister
slowly
shook
his
head
contemptuous
of
such
superstitious
i
saw
that
one
of
our
neighbor
madam
wallingford
s
favorite
oaks
was
sadly
broken
by
the
recent
gale
said
wentworth
unguardedly
and
this
was
sufficient
to
make
a
new
name
fairly
leap
into
the
conversation
of
roger
wallingford
the
son
of
a
widowed
lady
of
great
fortune
whose
house
stood
not
far
distant
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
in
somersworth
general
goodwin
at
once
dropped
his
voice
regretfully
i
am
afraid
that
we
can
have
no
doubt
now
of
the
young
man
s
sympathy
with
our
oppressors
said
he
i
hear
that
he
has
been
seen
within
a
week
coming
out
of
the
earl
of
halifax
tavern
in
portsmouth
late
at
night
as
if
from
a
secret
conference
a
friend
of
mine
heard
him
say
openly
on
the
parade
that
benjamin
thompson
of
old
rumford
had
been
unfairly
driven
to
seek
royalist
protection
and
to
flee
his
country
leaving
wife
and
infant
child
behind
him
that
t
was
all
from
the
base
suspicions
and
hounding
of
his
neighbors
whose
worst
taunt
had
ever
been
that
he
loved
and
sought
the
company
of
gentlemen
i
pity
him
from
my
heart
says
wallingford
in
a
loud
voice
as
if
pity
could
ever
belong
to
so
vile
a
traitor
but
i
fear
that
this
was
true
said
judge
chadbourne
the
soundest
of
patriots
gravely
interrupting
they
drove
young
thompson
away
in
hot
haste
when
his
country
was
in
sorest
need
of
all
such
naturally
chivalrous
and
able
men
he
meant
no
disloyalty
until
his
crisis
came
and
proved
his
rash
young
spirit
too
weak
to
meet
it
he
will
be
a
great
man
some
day
if
i
read
men
aright
we
shall
be
proud
of
him
in
spite
of
everything
he
had
his
foolish
follies
and
the
wrong
road
never
leads
to
the
right
place
but
the
taunts
of
the
would
have
made
many
an
older
man
fling
himself
out
of
reach
t
is
a
sad
mischance
of
war
young
wallingford
is
a
proud
fellow
and
has
his
follies
too
his
kindred
in
boston
thought
themselves
bound
to
the
king
they
are
his
elders
and
have
been
his
guardians
and
youth
may
forbid
his
seeing
the
fallacy
of
their
arguments
our
country
is
above
our
king
in
such
a
time
as
this
yet
i
myself
was
of
those
who
could
not
lightly
throw
off
the
allegiance
of
a
lifetime
i
have
always
said
that
we
must
have
patience
with
such
lads
and
not
try
to
drive
them
said
major
haggens
the
least
patient
of
all
the
gentlemen
captain
paul
jones
drummed
on
the
table
with
one
hand
and
rattled
the
links
of
his
sword
hilt
with
the
other
the
minister
looked
dark
and
unconvinced
but
the
old
judge
stood
first
among
his
parishioners
he
did
not
answer
but
threw
an
imploring
glance
toward
hamilton
at
the
head
of
the
table
we
are
beginning
to
lose
the
very
last
of
our
patience
now
with
those
who
cry
that
our
country
is
too
young
and
poor
to
go
alone
and
urge
that
we
should
bear
our
wrongs
and
be
tied
to
the
skirts
of
england
for
fifty
years
more
what
about
our
poor
sailors
dying
like
sheep
in
the
english
jails
said
hamilton
harshly
he
that
is
not
for
us
is
against
us
and
so
the
people
feel
the
true
patriot
is
the
man
who
risks
all
for
love
of
country
said
the
minister
following
fast
behind
they
have
little
to
risk
some
of
the
loudest
of
them
insisted
major
haggens
scornfully
they
would
not
brook
the
thought
of
conciliation
but
fire
and
sword
and
other
men
s
money
are
their
only
sinews
of
war
i
mean
that
some
of
those
in
boston
have
often
made
matters
worse
than
there
was
any
need
he
added
in
a
calmer
tone
paul
jones
cast
a
look
of
contempt
upon
such
a
complaining
old
soldier
you
must
remember
that
many
discomforts
accompany
a
great
struggle
he
answered
the
lower
classes
as
some
are
pleased
to
call
certain
citizens
of
our
republic
must
serve
liberty
in
their
own
fashion
they
are
used
to
homespun
and
not
to
lace
ruffles
but
they
make
good
fighters
and
their
hearts
are
true
sometimes
their
instinct
gives
them
to
see
farther
ahead
than
we
can
i
fear
indeed
that
there
is
trouble
brewing
for
some
of
your
valued
neighbors
who
are
not
willing
to
be
outspoken
a
certain
young
gentleman
has
of
late
shown
some
humble
desires
to
put
himself
into
an
honorable
position
for
safety
s
sake
you
mistake
us
sir
said
the
old
judge
hastening
to
speak
but
we
are
not
served
in
our
struggle
by
such
lawlessness
of
behavior
we
are
only
hindered
by
it
general
george
washington
is
our
proper
model
and
not
those
men
whose
manners
and
language
are
not
worthy
of
civilization
the
guest
of
the
evening
looked
frankly
bored
and
major
tilly
haggens
came
to
the
rescue
the
captain
s
dark
hint
had
set
them
all
staring
at
one
another
some
of
our
leaders
in
this
struggle
make
me
think
of
an
old
scottish
story
i
got
from
mcintire
in
york
said
he
there
was
an
old
farmer
went
to
the
elders
to
get
his
tokens
for
the
sacrament
and
they
propounded
him
his
questions
what
s
your
view
of
adam
says
they
what
kind
of
a
mon
well
says
the
farmer
i
think
adam
was
like
jack
simpson
the
horse
trader
varra
few
got
anything
by
him
an
a
mony
the
captain
laughed
gayly
as
if
with
a
sense
of
proprietorship
in
the
joke
t
is
old
scotland
all
over
he
acknowledged
and
then
his
face
grew
stern
again
your
loud
talkers
are
the
gadflies
that
hurry
the
slowest
oxen
he
warned
the
little
audience
and
we
have
to
remember
that
if
those
who
would
rob
america
of
her
liberties
should
still
prevail
we
all
sit
here
with
halters
round
our
necks
which
caused
the
spirits
of
the
company
to
sink
so
low
that
again
the
cheerful
major
tried
to
succor
it
shall
we
drink
to
the
ladies
he
suggested
with
fine
though
unexpected
courtesy
and
they
drank
as
if
it
were
the
first
toast
of
the
evening
we
are
in
the
middle
of
a
great
war
now
and
must
do
the
best
we
can
said
hamilton
as
if
he
wished
to
make
peace
about
his
table
last
summer
when
things
were
at
the
darkest
sam
adams
came
riding
down
to
exeter
to
plead
with
gilman
for
money
and
troops
on
the
part
of
their
rockingham
towns
the
treasurer
was
away
and
his
wife
saw
adams
s
great
anxiety
and
the
tears
rolling
down
his
cheeks
and
heard
him
groan
aloud
as
he
paced
to
and
fro
in
the
room
my
god
says
he
must
we
give
it
all
up
when
the
good
lady
told
me
there
were
tears
in
her
own
eyes
and
i
vow
that
i
was
fired
as
i
had
never
been
before
have
loved
the
man
ever
since
i
called
him
a
stirrer
up
of
frenzies
once
but
it
fell
upon
my
heart
that
after
all
it
is
men
like
sam
adams
who
hold
us
to
our
duty
i
can
not
envy
sam
curwen
his
travels
in
rural
england
or
gray
that
he
moves
in
the
best
london
society
but
hancock
writes
me
tis
thought
all
our
best
men
have
left
us
said
judge
chadbourne
t
is
a
very
genteel
company
now
at
bristol
said
john
lord
i
hear
that
the
east
india
company
is
in
terrible
difficulties
and
her
warehouses
in
london
are
crammed
to
bursting
with
the
tea
that
we
have
refused
to
drink
if
they
only
had
sense
enough
to
lift
the
tax
and
give
us
liberty
for
our
own
trade
we
should
soon
drink
all
their
troubles
dry
said
colonel
hamilton
t
is
not
because
we
hate
england
but
because
we
love
her
that
we
are
hurt
so
deep
said
hill
when
a
man
s
mother
is
jealous
because
he
prospers
and
turns
against
him
it
is
worst
of
all
send
your
young
men
to
sea
cried
captain
paul
jones
who
had
no
patience
with
the
resettling
of
questions
already
left
far
behind
send
me
thoroughbred
lads
like
your
dainty
young
wallingford
you
must
all
understand
how
little
can
be
done
with
this
poor
basket
of
a
ranger
against
a
british
my
reverend
friend
here
has
his
heart
in
the
matter
i
myself
have
flung
away
friends
and
fortune
for
my
adopted
country
and
she
has
been
but
a
stingy
young
stepmother
to
me
i
go
to
fight
her
cause
on
the
shores
that
gave
me
birth
i
trample
some
dear
recollections
under
foot
and
she
haggles
with
me
all
summer
over
a
paltry
vessel
none
too
smart
for
a
fisherman
and
sends
me
to
sea
in
her
with
my
gallant
crew
you
all
know
that
the
ranger
is
crank
built
and
her
timbers
not
first
class
thin
sails
are
but
coarse
hessings
with
neither
a
spare
sheet
nor
stuff
to
make
it
and
there
s
not
even
room
aboard
for
all
her
guns
i
sent
four
ashore
out
of
her
this
very
day
so
that
we
can
train
the
rest
t
is
some
of
your
pretty
tories
that
have
picked
our
knots
as
fast
as
we
tied
them
and
some
jealous
hand
chose
poor
planking
for
our
decks
and
rotten
knees
for
the
frame
but
thank
god
she
s
a
vessel
at
last
i
would
sail
for
france
in
a
gundalow
so
help
me
heaven
and
once
in
france
i
shall
have
a
proper
there
was
a
chorus
of
approval
and
applause
the
listeners
were
deeply
touched
and
roused
they
all
wished
to
hear
something
of
the
captain
s
plans
but
he
returned
to
the
silver
tumbler
of
claret
and
sat
for
a
moment
as
if
considering
his
head
was
held
high
and
his
eyes
flashed
with
excitement
as
he
looked
up
at
the
high
cornice
of
the
room
he
had
borne
the
name
of
the
sea
wolf
in
that
moment
of
excitement
he
looked
ready
to
spring
upon
any
foe
but
to
the
disappointment
of
every
one
he
said
no
more
the
country
is
drained
now
of
ready
money
said
young
lord
despondently
this
war
goes
on
as
it
must
go
on
at
great
sacrifice
the
reserves
must
come
out
who
make
excuse
and
the
only
sons
and
even
men
like
me
turned
off
at
first
for
lack
of
health
we
meet
the
strain
sadly
in
this
little
town
we
have
done
the
best
we
could
on
the
river
sir
in
fitting
out
your
frigate
but
you
must
reflect
upon
our
situation
the
captain
could
not
resist
a
comprehensive
glance
at
the
richly
furnished
table
and
stately
of
his
host
and
there
was
not
a
man
who
saw
it
who
did
not
flush
with
resentment
we
are
poorly
off
for
stores
he
said
bitterly
and
nothing
takes
down
the
courage
of
a
seaman
like
poor
fare
i
found
that
we
had
only
thirty
gallons
of
spirits
for
the
whole
crew
at
which
melancholy
information
major
haggens
s
kind
heart
could
not
forbear
a
groan
general
goodwin
waved
his
hand
and
took
his
turn
to
speak
with
much
dignity
this
is
the
first
time
that
we
have
all
been
guests
at
this
hospitable
board
in
many
long
weeks
he
announced
gravely
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
propriety
of
republican
simplicity
or
our
readiness
to
submit
to
it
though
our
ancient
berwick
traditions
have
taught
us
otherwise
but
i
see
reason
to
agree
with
our
friend
and
former
townsman
judge
sullivan
who
lately
answered
john
adams
for
his
upbraiding
of
president
hancock
s
generous
way
of
doing
things
he
insists
that
such
open
hospitality
is
to
be
praised
when
consistent
with
the
means
of
the
host
and
that
when
the
people
are
anxious
and
depressed
it
is
important
to
the
public
cheerfulness
t
is
true
james
sullivan
is
right
said
major
haggens
we
are
not
at
poverty
s
back
door
either
you
will
still
find
a
glass
of
decent
wine
in
every
gentleman
s
house
in
old
barvick
and
a
mug
of
honest
cider
by
every
farmer
s
fireside
we
may
lack
foreign
luxuries
but
we
can
well
sustain
ourselves
this
summer
has
found
many
women
active
in
the
fields
where
our
men
have
dropped
the
hoe
to
take
their
old
swords
again
that
were
busy
in
the
earlier
ways
we
have
quelled
the
savage
but
the
wars
of
civilization
are
not
less
to
be
dreaded
said
the
good
minister
war
is
but
war
said
colonel
hamilton
let
us
drink
to
peace
gentlemen
and
they
all
drank
heartily
but
paul
jones
looked
startled
as
if
the
war
might
really
end
without
having
served
his
own
ambitions
nature
has
made
a
hero
of
him
said
the
judge
to
his
neighbor
as
they
saw
and
read
the
emotion
of
the
captain
s
look
circumstances
have
now
given
him
the
command
of
men
and
a
great
opportunity
we
shall
see
the
result
yet
t
is
a
contemptible
force
of
ship
and
men
to
think
of
striking
terror
along
the
strong
coasts
of
england
observed
hill
to
the
parson
who
answered
him
with
sympathy
and
the
talk
broke
up
and
was
only
between
man
and
man
while
the
chief
thought
of
every
one
was
upon
the
venison
fine
saddle
that
had
come
down
the
week
before
from
the
north
country
about
the
saco
intervales
character
of
sad
was
i
even
to
pain
deprest
importunate
and
heavy
load
the
comforter
hath
found
me
here
upon
this
lonely
road
your
friend
general
sullivan
has
had
his
defamers
but
he
goes
to
prove
himself
one
of
our
ablest
men
said
paul
jones
to
hamilton
i
grieve
to
see
that
his
old
father
that
lofty
spirit
and
fine
wit
is
not
with
us
sullivan
is
a
soldier
born
there
is
something
in
descent
said
hamilton
eagerly
they
come
of
a
line
of
fighting
men
famous
in
the
irish
struggles
john
sullivan
s
grandfather
was
with
patrick
sarsfield
the
great
earl
of
lucan
at
limerick
and
the
master
himself
if
all
tales
are
true
was
much
involved
in
the
early
plots
of
the
old
pretender
no
sir
he
was
not
out
in
the
he
was
a
student
at
that
time
in
france
but
i
dare
say
ready
to
lend
himself
to
anything
that
brought
revenge
upon
england
commend
me
to
your
ancient
sage
the
master
said
the
captain
i
wish
we
might
have
had
him
here
when
we
last
dined
here
together
he
talked
not
only
of
our
unfortunate
king
james
but
of
the
great
prince
of
conti
and
louis
quatorze
as
if
he
had
seen
them
yesterday
he
was
close
to
many
great
events
in
france
you
speak
of
our
old
master
sullivan
said
major
haggens
eagerly
edging
his
chair
a
little
nearer
yes
he
knew
all
those
great
frenchmen
as
he
knows
his
virgil
and
tally
we
are
all
his
pupils
here
old
men
and
young
he
is
master
of
a
little
school
on
pine
hill
there
is
no
better
scholar
and
gentleman
in
new
england
or
old
england
either
added
judge
chadbourne
they
say
that
he
had
four
countesses
to
his
grandmothers
and
that
his
grandfathers
were
lords
of
beare
and
bantry
and
princes
of
ireland
said
the
major
his
father
was
banished
to
france
by
the
stuarts
and
died
from
a
duel
there
and
the
master
was
brought
up
in
one
of
their
great
colleges
in
paris
where
his
house
held
a
scholarship
he
was
reared
among
the
best
frenchmen
of
his
time
as
for
his
coming
here
there
are
many
old
stories
some
say
t
was
being
found
in
some
treasonable
plot
and
some
that
t
was
for
the
sake
of
a
lady
whom
his
mother
would
not
let
him
stoop
to
marry
he
vowed
that
she
should
never
see
his
face
again
all
his
fortunes
depended
on
his
mother
so
he
fled
the
country
with
the
lady
asked
the
captain
with
interest
and
pushing
along
the
decanter
of
madeira
no
said
the
major
stopping
to
fill
his
own
glass
as
if
it
were
a
pledge
of
remembrance
no
he
came
to
old
york
a
bachelor
to
the
farm
of
the
mcintires
royalist
exiles
in
the
old
cromwell
times
and
worked
there
with
his
hands
until
some
one
asked
him
if
he
could
write
a
letter
and
he
wrote
it
in
seven
languages
then
the
minister
old
moody
planted
him
in
our
grammar
school
there
had
been
great
lack
of
classical
teaching
in
all
this
region
for
those
who
would
be
college
bred
and
since
that
early
year
he
has
kept
his
school
for
lads
and
now
and
then
for
a
bright
girl
or
two
like
miss
mary
hamilton
and
her
mother
before
her
one
such
man
who
knows
the
world
and
holds
that
rarest
jewel
the
teacher
s
gift
can
uplift
a
whole
community
said
the
captain
with
enthusiasm
i
see
now
the
cause
of
such
difference
between
your
own
and
other
early
planted
towns
master
sullivan
has
proved
himself
a
nobler
prince
and
leader
than
any
of
his
ancestry
but
what
of
the
lady
i
heard
many
tales
of
him
before
i
possessed
the
pleasure
of
his
acquaintance
and
so
heard
them
with
indifference
he
had
to
wife
a
pretty
child
of
the
ship
s
company
an
orphan
whom
he
befriended
and
later
married
she
was
sprightly
and
of
great
beauty
in
her
youth
and
was
dowered
with
all
the
energy
in
practical
things
that
he
had
been
denied
said
the
judge
she
came
of
plain
peasant
stock
but
the
poor
soul
has
a
noble
heart
she
flouts
his
idleness
at
one
moment
and
bewails
their
poverty
and
then
falls
on
her
knees
to
worship
him
the
next
and
is
as
proud
as
if
she
had
married
the
lord
of
the
manor
at
home
the
master
lacked
any
true
companionship
until
he
bred
it
for
himself
it
has
been
a
solitary
life
and
hermitage
for
either
an
irish
adventurer
or
a
french
scholar
and
courtier
the
master
can
rarely
be
tempted
now
from
the
little
south
window
where
he
sits
with
his
few
books
said
hamilton
i
lived
neighbor
to
him
all
my
young
days
not
long
ago
he
went
to
visit
his
son
james
and
walked
out
with
him
to
see
the
village
at
the
falls
of
the
saco
there
was
an
old
woman
lately
come
over
from
ireland
with
her
grandchildren
they
said
she
remembered
things
in
charles
the
second
s
time
and
was
above
a
hundred
years
of
age
james
sullivan
the
judge
thinking
to
amuse
his
father
stopped
before
the
house
and
out
came
the
old
creature
and
fell
upon
her
knees
my
god
t
is
the
young
prince
of
ardea
says
she
oh
i
mind
me
well
of
your
lady
mother
sir
t
was
in
derry
i
was
born
but
i
lived
a
year
in
ardea
and
yourself
was
a
pretty
boy
busy
with
your
courting
the
old
man
burst
into
tears
let
us
go
james
says
he
or
this
will
break
my
heart
but
he
stopped
and
said
a
few
words
to
her
in
a
whisper
and
gave
the
old
body
his
blessing
and
all
that
was
in
his
poor
purse
he
would
listen
to
her
no
more
we
need
not
speak
of
youth
he
told
her
we
remember
it
only
too
well
a
man
told
me
this
who
stood
by
and
heard
the
whole
twas
most
affecting
it
spurs
the
imagination
said
the
captain
if
i
had
but
an
hour
to
spare
i
should
ride
to
see
him
once
more
even
by
night
you
will
carry
the
master
my
best
respects
some
of
you
one
last
glass
gentlemen
to
our
noble
cause
we
may
never
sit
in
pleasant
company
again
he
added
and
they
all
rose
in
their
places
and
stood
about
the
table
my
old
auntie
used
to
say
to
me
at
home
aim
high
s
the
english
of
it
she
was
of
the
bold
clan
of
the
macduffs
and
t
is
my
own
motto
in
these
anxious
days
gentlemen
all
said
the
little
captain
i
ask
for
your
kind
wishes
and
your
prayers
they
all
looked
at
hamilton
and
then
at
one
another
but
nobody
took
it
upon
himself
to
speak
so
they
shook
hands
warmly
and
drank
their
last
toast
in
silence
and
with
deep
feeling
it
was
time
to
join
the
ladies
already
there
was
a
sound
of
music
across
the
hall
in
a
great
room
which
had
been
cleared
for
the
dancing
flowering
of
whose
dear
love
for
nothing
less
than
thee
would
i
have
broke
this
happy
dream
therefore
thou
wak
dst
me
wisely
yet
my
dream
thou
breakest
not
but
continuest
it
while
the
guests
went
in
to
supper
mary
hamilton
safe
in
the
shelter
of
friendly
shadows
went
hurrying
along
the
upper
hall
of
the
house
to
her
own
chamber
the
coming
moon
was
already
brightening
the
eastern
sky
so
that
when
she
opened
the
door
the
large
room
with
its
white
hangings
was
all
dimly
lighted
from
without
and
she
could
see
the
figure
of
a
girl
standing
at
one
of
the
windows
oh
you
are
here
she
cried
with
sharp
anxiety
and
then
they
leaned
out
together
with
their
arms
about
each
other
s
shoulders
looking
down
at
the
dark
cove
and
at
the
height
beyond
where
the
tops
of
tall
pines
were
silvered
like
a
cloud
they
could
hear
the
men
s
voices
as
if
they
were
all
talking
together
in
the
room
below
mary
looked
at
her
friend
s
face
in
the
dim
light
there
were
some
who
counted
miss
elizabeth
wyat
as
great
a
beauty
as
miss
hamilton
oh
betsey
dear
i
can
hardly
bear
to
ask
but
tell
me
quick
now
what
you
have
heard
i
must
go
down
to
peggy
she
has
attempted
everything
for
this
last
feast
and
i
promised
her
to
trim
the
game
pie
for
its
proud
appearing
and
the
great
plum
cake
one
of
her
maids
is
ill
and
she
is
in
such
a
flurry
t
was
our
own
maids
talking
answered
betsey
wyat
slowly
they
were
on
the
with
their
linen
this
morning
the
sun
was
so
hot
and
i
was
near
by
among
the
barberry
bushes
in
the
garden
thankful
grant
was
sobbing
in
great
distress
she
said
that
her
young
man
had
put
himself
in
danger
he
was
under
a
vow
to
come
out
with
the
mob
from
dover
any
night
now
that
the
signal
called
them
to
attack
madam
wallingford
s
house
and
make
roger
declare
his
principles
they
were
sure
he
was
a
tory
fast
enough
and
they
meant
to
knock
the
old
nest
to
pieces
they
are
bidden
to
be
ready
with
their
tools
their
axes
she
said
and
something
for
a
torch
thankful
begged
him
to
feign
illness
but
he
said
he
did
not
dare
and
would
go
with
the
rest
at
any
rate
she
said
she
fronted
him
with
the
remembrance
how
madam
had
paid
his
wages
all
last
summer
when
he
was
laid
by
though
the
hurt
he
got
was
not
done
in
her
service
but
in
breaking
his
own
colt
on
a
sunday
yet
nothing
changed
him
he
said
he
was
all
for
liberty
and
would
not
play
the
sneak
now
oh
how
cruel
when
nobody
has
been
so
kind
and
generous
as
madam
wallingford
so
full
of
kind
thought
for
the
poor
exclaimed
mary
and
roger
he
would
like
it
better
if
you
thought
first
of
him
not
of
his
mother
said
betsey
wyat
reproachfully
what
can
be
done
it
may
be
this
very
night
said
mary
in
a
voice
of
despair
the
only
thing
left
is
to
declare
his
principles
things
have
gone
so
far
now
they
will
never
give
him
any
peace
many
have
come
to
the
belief
that
he
is
in
close
league
with
our
enemies
that
he
has
never
been
said
mary
hotly
he
must
prove
it
to
the
doubting
patriots
then
so
my
father
says
but
not
to
a
mob
of
rascals
who
will
be
disappointed
if
they
can
not
vex
their
betters
and
ruin
an
innocent
woman
s
home
and
spoil
her
peace
only
to
show
their
power
oh
betsey
what
in
the
world
shall
we
do
there
is
no
place
left
for
those
who
will
take
neither
side
oh
help
me
to
think
what
we
shall
do
the
mob
may
be
there
this
very
night
there
was
a
strange
crowd
about
the
landing
just
now
when
the
captain
came
i
dare
not
send
any
one
across
the
river
with
such
a
message
but
old
cæsar
or
peggy
and
they
are
not
to
be
spared
from
the
house
i
trust
none
of
the
younger
people
black
or
white
when
it
comes
to
this
but
he
was
safe
in
portsmouth
they
will
watch
for
his
being
at
home
it
will
not
be
then
said
betsey
wyat
hopefully
i
think
that
he
should
have
spoken
long
ago
if
only
to
protect
his
mother
get
ready
now
dear
betty
and
make
yourself
very
fine
said
mary
at
last
the
people
will
all
be
coming
for
the
dance
long
before
supper
is
done
my
brother
was
angry
when
i
told
him
i
should
not
sit
at
the
table
but
i
could
not
there
is
nobody
to
make
it
gay
afterward
with
our
beaux
all
gone
to
the
army
but
captain
paul
jones
begged
hard
for
some
dancing
and
all
the
girls
are
coming
hills
and
rights
and
the
lords
from
somersworth
i
must
manage
to
tell
my
brother
of
this
danger
but
to
openly
protect
madam
wallingford
would
be
openly
taking
the
wrong
side
and
who
will
follow
him
in
such
a
step
i
could
not
pass
the
great
window
on
the
stairs
without
looking
out
in
fear
that
madam
s
house
would
be
all
ablaze
whispered
betsey
wyat
shuddering
there
have
been
such
dreadful
things
done
against
the
tories
in
salem
and
boston
my
heart
is
stone
cold
with
fear
said
mary
hamilton
yet
if
it
only
does
not
come
there
may
be
something
done
there
was
a
silence
between
the
friends
they
clung
to
each
other
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
youth
and
beauty
knew
the
harsh
blows
of
war
the
loud
noise
of
the
river
falls
came
beating
into
the
room
echoing
back
from
the
high
pines
across
the
water
we
must
make
us
fine
dear
and
get
ready
for
the
dancing
i
have
no
heart
for
it
now
i
am
so
frightened
said
mary
sadly
but
get
you
ready
we
must
do
the
best
we
can
you
are
the
only
one
who
can
do
anything
said
little
betsey
wyat
holding
her
back
a
moment
from
the
door
they
were
both
silent
again
as
a
great
peal
of
laughter
sounded
from
below
just
then
the
moon
came
up
clear
of
the
eastern
hill
and
flooded
all
the
room
thou
source
of
all
my
bliss
and
all
my
woe
an
hour
later
there
was
a
soft
night
wind
blowing
through
the
garden
trees
flavored
with
the
salt
scent
of
the
tide
and
the
fragrance
of
the
upland
pastures
and
pine
woods
mary
hamilton
came
alone
to
a
great
arched
window
of
the
the
lights
were
bright
the
house
looked
eager
for
its
gayeties
and
there
was
a
steady
sound
of
voices
at
the
supper
but
she
put
them
all
behind
her
with
impatience
she
stood
hesitating
for
a
moment
and
then
sat
down
on
the
broad
window
seat
to
breathe
the
pleasant
air
betsey
wyat
in
the
north
parlor
was
softly
touching
the
notes
of
some
old
country
song
on
the
spinet
the
young
mistress
of
the
house
leaned
her
head
wearily
on
her
hand
as
she
looked
down
the
garden
terraces
to
the
river
she
wished
the
long
evening
were
at
an
end
but
she
must
somehow
manage
to
go
through
its
perils
and
further
all
the
difficult
gayeties
of
the
hour
she
looked
back
once
into
the
handsome
empty
room
and
turned
again
toward
the
quiet
garden
below
on
the
second
terrace
it
was
dark
with
shadows
there
were
some
huge
plants
of
box
that
stood
solid
and
black
while
the
rosebushes
and
young
were
but
a
gray
mist
of
twigs
at
the
end
of
the
terrace
were
some
thick
lilacs
with
a
few
leaves
still
clinging
in
the
mild
weather
to
shelter
a
man
who
stood
there
watching
mary
hamilton
as
she
watched
the
shadows
and
the
brightening
river
there
was
the
sharp
crying
of
a
violin
from
the
slaves
dwellings
over
beyond
the
house
it
was
plain
to
any
person
of
experience
that
the
brief
time
of
rest
and
informality
after
the
evening
feast
would
soon
be
over
and
that
the
dancing
was
about
to
begin
the
call
of
the
fiddle
seemed
to
have
been
heard
not
only
through
the
house
but
in
all
its
neighborhood
there
were
voices
coming
down
the
hill
and
a
rowboat
rounding
the
point
with
a
merry
party
from
the
rooms
above
gay
voices
helped
to
break
the
silence
while
the
last
touches
were
being
given
to
heads
and
evening
gowns
but
mary
hamilton
did
not
move
until
she
saw
a
tall
figure
step
out
from
among
the
lilacs
into
the
white
moonlight
and
come
quickly
along
the
lower
terrace
and
up
the
steps
toward
the
window
where
she
was
sitting
it
was
roger
wallingford
i
must
speak
with
you
said
he
forgetting
to
speak
softly
in
his
eagerness
i
waited
for
a
minute
to
be
sure
there
was
nobody
with
you
i
am
in
no
trim
to
make
one
of
your
gay
company
quick
mary
i
must
speak
to
you
alone
the
girl
had
started
as
one
does
when
a
face
comes
suddenly
out
of
the
dark
she
stood
up
and
pushed
away
the
curtain
for
a
moment
and
looked
behind
her
then
shrank
into
a
deep
alcove
at
the
side
within
the
arch
she
stepped
forward
next
moment
and
held
the
with
one
hand
as
if
she
feared
to
let
go
her
hold
the
young
man
bent
his
head
and
kissed
her
tense
fingers
i
can
not
talk
with
you
now
you
are
sure
to
be
found
here
i
hoped
that
you
were
still
in
portsmouth
go
is
your
only
safety
to
go
away
she
protested
what
has
happened
oh
come
out
to
me
for
a
moment
mary
he
answered
speaking
quietly
enough
but
with
much
insistence
in
his
imploring
tone
i
must
see
you
it
is
my
only
chance
she
nodded
and
warned
him
back
and
tossed
aside
the
curtain
turning
again
toward
the
lighted
room
where
sudden
footsteps
had
startled
her
there
were
several
guests
coming
in
a
little
perplexed
to
seek
their
hostess
but
the
slight
figure
of
captain
paul
jones
in
his
brilliant
uniform
was
first
at
hand
the
fair
head
turned
toward
him
not
without
eagerness
and
the
watcher
outside
saw
his
lady
smile
and
go
readily
away
it
was
hard
enough
to
have
patience
outside
in
the
moonlight
night
until
the
first
country
dances
could
reach
their
weary
end
he
stood
for
a
moment
full
in
the
light
that
shone
from
the
window
his
heart
beating
within
him
in
heavy
strokes
and
then
as
if
there
were
no
need
of
prudence
went
straight
along
the
terrace
to
the
broad
grassy
court
at
the
house
s
front
there
was
a
white
balustrade
along
the
farther
side
at
the
steep
edge
of
the
bank
and
he
passed
the
end
of
it
and
went
a
few
steps
down
the
river
shone
below
under
the
elms
the
tide
was
just
at
the
beginning
of
its
full
flood
there
was
a
short
hour
at
best
before
the
ebb
roger
wallingford
folded
his
arms
and
stood
waiting
with
what
plain
patience
he
could
gather
the
shrill
music
jarred
harshly
upon
his
ear
the
dancing
went
on
there
were
gay
girls
enough
but
little
betsey
wyat
that
dear
and
happy
heart
had
only
solemn
old
jack
hamilton
to
her
partner
and
pretty
martha
hill
was
coquetting
with
the
venerable
judge
these
were
also
the
works
of
war
and
some
of
the
poor
lads
who
had
left
their
ladies
to
fight
for
the
rights
of
the
colonies
would
never
again
tread
a
measure
in
the
great
room
at
hamilton
s
perhaps
roger
wallingford
himself
might
not
take
his
place
at
the
dancing
any
more
he
walked
to
and
fro
with
his
eyes
ever
upon
the
doorway
and
two
by
two
the
company
came
in
turn
to
stand
there
and
to
look
out
upon
the
broad
river
and
the
moon
the
fiddles
had
a
trivial
sound
and
the
slow
night
breeze
and
the
heavy
monotone
of
the
falls
mocked
at
them
while
from
far
down
the
river
there
came
a
cry
of
herons
disturbed
in
their
early
sleep
about
the
fishing
weirs
and
the
mocking
laughter
of
a
loon
nature
seemed
to
be
looking
on
contemptuously
at
the
silly
pleasantries
of
men
nature
was
aware
of
graver
things
than
fiddles
and
the
dance
it
seemed
that
night
as
if
the
time
for
such
childish
follies
had
passed
forever
from
the
earth
there
must
have
been
many
a
moment
when
mary
hamilton
could
have
slipped
away
and
a
cold
impatience
vexed
the
watcher
s
heart
at
last
looking
up
toward
the
bright
house
his
eyes
were
held
by
a
light
figure
that
was
coming
round
from
the
courtyard
that
lay
between
the
house
and
its
long
row
of
outbuildings
he
was
quickly
up
the
bank
but
the
figure
had
already
flitted
across
the
open
space
a
little
way
beyond
roger
he
heard
her
call
to
him
where
are
you
and
he
hurried
along
the
bank
to
meet
her
let
us
go
farther
down
she
said
sharply
they
may
find
us
if
they
come
straying
out
between
the
dances
to
see
the
moon
and
she
passed
him
quickly
running
down
the
bank
and
out
beyond
the
edge
of
the
shadow
to
the
great
rock
that
broke
the
curving
shore
here
she
stood
and
faced
him
against
the
wide
background
of
the
river
her
dress
glimmered
strangely
white
and
he
could
see
the
bright
paste
buckle
in
one
of
her
as
the
moonlight
touched
her
he
came
a
step
nearer
perplexed
by
such
silence
and
unwonted
coldness
but
waited
for
her
to
speak
though
he
had
begged
this
moment
for
his
own
errand
what
do
you
want
roger
she
asked
impatiently
but
the
young
man
could
not
see
that
she
was
pressing
both
hands
against
her
heart
she
was
out
of
breath
and
excited
as
she
never
had
been
before
but
she
stood
there
insistent
as
he
and
held
herself
remote
in
dignity
from
their
ease
and
habit
of
companionship
oh
mary
said
young
roger
his
voice
breaking
with
the
uncertainty
of
his
sorrow
have
you
no
kind
word
for
me
i
have
had
a
terrible
day
in
portsmouth
and
i
came
to
tell
you
but
still
she
did
not
speak
and
he
hung
his
head
forgive
me
dear
he
said
i
do
not
understand
you
but
whatever
it
is
forgive
me
so
we
may
be
friends
again
i
forgive
you
said
the
girl
how
is
it
with
your
own
conscience
can
you
find
it
so
easy
to
forgive
yourself
i
am
ashamed
of
nothing
said
wallingford
and
he
lifted
his
handsome
head
proudly
and
gazed
at
her
in
wonder
but
tell
me
my
fault
and
i
shall
do
my
best
to
mend
perhaps
a
man
in
such
love
and
trouble
as
i
you
shall
not
speak
to
me
of
love
said
mary
hamilton
drawing
back
then
she
came
nearer
with
a
reckless
step
as
if
to
show
him
how
little
she
thought
of
his
presence
you
are
bringing
sorrow
and
danger
to
those
who
should
count
upon
your
manliness
in
another
hour
your
mother
s
house
may
be
in
flames
do
not
speak
to
me
of
your
poor
scruples
any
more
and
as
for
love
but
it
is
all
i
have
to
say
pleaded
the
young
man
it
is
all
my
life
and
thought
i
do
not
know
what
you
mean
by
these
wild
tales
of
danger
i
am
not
going
to
be
driven
away
from
my
rights
i
must
stand
my
own
ground
give
me
some
proof
that
you
are
your
country
s
friend
and
not
her
foe
i
am
tired
of
the
old
arguments
i
am
the
last
to
have
you
cry
upon
patriotism
because
you
are
afraid
i
can
not
tell
you
all
i
know
but
indeed
there
is
danger
i
beg
you
to
declare
yourself
now
this
very
night
oh
roger
is
the
only
way
and
mary
could
speak
no
more
she
was
trembling
with
fright
and
passion
something
shook
her
so
that
she
could
hardly
give
sound
to
her
voice
all
her
usual
steadiness
was
gone
my
love
has
come
to
be
the
whole
of
life
said
roger
wallingford
slowly
i
am
here
to
show
you
how
much
i
love
you
though
you
think
that
i
have
been
putting
you
to
shame
all
day
i
have
been
closeted
with
langdon
and
his
officers
in
portsmouth
i
have
told
them
the
truth
that
my
heart
and
my
principles
were
all
against
this
war
and
i
would
not
be
driven
by
any
man
living
but
i
have
come
to
see
that
since
there
is
a
war
and
a
division
my
place
is
with
my
countrymen
listen
dear
i
shall
take
your
challenge
since
you
throw
it
down
and
his
face
grew
hard
and
pale
i
am
going
to
sail
on
board
the
ranger
and
she
sails
there
was
a
commission
still
in
langdon
s
hands
and
he
gave
it
me
though
your
noble
captain
took
it
upon
himself
to
object
i
have
been
ready
to
give
it
up
at
every
step
when
i
was
alone
again
riding
home
from
portsmouth
i
could
not
beg
any
man
s
permission
and
we
parted
in
a
heat
now
i
go
to
say
farewell
to
my
poor
mother
and
i
fear
t
will
break
her
heart
i
can
even
make
my
peace
with
the
commander
if
it
is
your
pleasure
will
this
prove
to
you
that
i
am
a
true
american
i
came
to
tell
you
this
to
sail
on
board
the
ranger
she
repeated
under
her
breath
she
gave
a
strange
sigh
of
relief
and
looked
up
at
the
lighted
house
as
if
she
were
dreaming
then
a
thought
came
over
her
and
turned
her
sick
with
dread
if
paul
jones
should
refuse
if
he
should
say
that
he
dared
not
risk
the
presence
of
a
man
who
was
believed
to
be
so
close
to
the
tory
plots
the
very
necessities
of
danger
must
hold
her
resolute
while
she
shrank
womanlike
from
the
harsh
immediateness
of
decision
for
if
paul
jones
should
refuse
this
officer
and
being
in
power
should
turn
him
back
at
the
very
last
there
lay
ready
the
awful
opportunity
of
the
mob
and
roger
wallingford
was
a
ruined
man
and
an
exile
from
that
time
you
shall
not
give
one
thought
to
that
adventurer
cried
the
angry
lover
whose
quick
instinct
knew
where
mary
s
thoughts
had
gone
he
has
boldness
enough
but
only
for
his
own
advance
he
makes
light
jokes
of
those
stop
i
must
hear
no
more
said
the
young
queen
coldly
it
would
ill
befit
you
now
farewell
for
the
present
i
go
to
speak
with
the
captain
i
have
duties
to
my
guests
but
the
tears
shone
in
her
eyes
she
was
for
flitting
past
him
like
a
fawn
as
they
climbed
the
high
bank
together
the
pebbles
rattled
down
under
their
hurrying
feet
and
the
dry
elm
twigs
snapped
as
if
with
fire
but
wallingford
kept
close
at
her
side
oh
my
darling
he
said
and
his
changed
voice
easily
enough
touched
her
heart
and
made
her
stand
still
do
not
forgive
me
then
until
you
have
better
reason
to
trust
me
only
do
not
say
that
i
must
never
speak
we
may
be
together
now
for
the
last
time
i
may
never
see
you
again
if
you
can
bear
you
like
a
man
if
you
can
take
a
man
s
brave
part
again
her
voice
fell
silent
then
i
may
come
then
you
may
come
wallingford
she
answered
proudly
for
one
moment
his
heart
was
warm
with
the
happiness
of
hope
herself
stood
irresolute
they
heard
heavy
footsteps
and
she
was
gone
from
his
vision
like
a
flash
of
light
then
the
pain
and
seizure
of
his
fate
were
upon
him
the
break
with
his
old
life
and
all
its
conditions
love
would
now
walk
ever
by
his
side
though
mary
hamilton
herself
had
gone
she
had
not
even
given
him
her
dear
hand
at
parting
captain
the
hous
of
fame
to
descrive
thou
shalt
see
me
go
as
blyve
unto
the
next
laure
i
see
and
kisse
it
for
it
is
thy
tree
at
this
moment
the
was
lively
enough
whatever
anxieties
might
have
been
known
under
the
elms
and
two
windows
on
either
side
of
the
great
fireplace
were
filled
with
ladies
who
looked
on
at
the
dancing
a
fine
group
of
elderly
gentlewomen
dressed
in
the
highest
french
fashion
of
five
years
back
sat
together
with
nodding
turbans
and
swaying
fans
and
faced
the
doorway
as
miss
hamilton
came
in
they
had
begun
to
comment
upon
her
absence
but
something
could
be
forgiven
a
young
hostess
who
might
be
having
a
thoughtful
eye
to
her
trays
of
refreshment
there
was
still
an
anxious
look
on
many
faces
as
if
this
show
of
finery
and
gayety
were
out
of
keeping
with
the
country
s
sad
distresses
though
hamilton
like
nero
fiddled
while
rome
was
burning
everybody
had
come
to
look
on
the
surrender
of
burgoyne
had
put
new
heart
into
everybody
and
the
evening
was
a
pleasant
relief
to
the
dark
apprehension
and
cheerless
economies
of
many
lives
most
persons
were
rich
in
anticipation
of
the
success
of
paul
jones
s
enterprise
as
if
he
were
a
sort
of
lucky
lottery
in
which
every
one
was
sure
of
a
handsome
prize
the
winning
of
large
prize
money
in
the
capture
of
richly
laden
british
vessels
had
already
been
a
very
heartening
incident
of
this
most
difficult
and
dreary
time
of
war
when
mary
hamilton
came
in
there
happened
to
be
a
pause
between
the
dances
and
an
instant
murmur
of
delight
ran
from
chair
to
chair
of
those
who
were
seated
about
the
room
she
had
looked
pale
and
downcast
in
the
early
evening
but
was
now
and
there
was
a
new
light
in
her
eyes
it
seemed
as
if
the
charm
of
her
beauty
had
never
shone
so
bright
she
crossed
the
open
space
of
the
floor
unconscious
as
a
child
and
captain
paul
jones
stepped
out
to
meet
her
the
pink
brocaded
flowers
of
her
shimmering
satin
gown
bloomed
the
better
for
the
evening
air
and
a
fall
of
splendid
lace
of
a
light
frosty
pattern
only
half
hid
her
white
throat
it
was
her
brother
s
pleasure
to
command
such
marvels
of
french
gowns
and
to
send
orders
by
his
captains
for
mary
s
adorning
she
was
part
of
the
splendor
of
his
house
moreover
and
his
heart
was
filled
with
perfect
satisfaction
as
she
went
down
the
room
the
simpler
figures
of
the
first
dances
were
over
the
country
dances
and
reels
and
now
lord
and
miss
betsey
wyat
took
their
places
with
mary
and
the
captain
and
made
their
courtesies
at
the
beginning
of
an
old
french
dance
of
great
elegance
which
was
known
to
be
the
favorite
of
the
old
judge
they
stood
before
him
in
a
pretty
row
like
courtiers
who
would
offer
pleasure
to
their
rightful
king
and
made
their
obeisance
all
living
color
and
fine
clothes
and
affectionate
intent
the
captain
was
scarcely
so
tall
as
his
partner
but
gallant
enough
in
his
uniform
and
took
his
steps
with
beautiful
grace
and
the
least
fling
of
carelessness
while
john
lord
moved
with
the
precision
of
a
french
abbé
always
responsible
for
outward
decorum
whatever
might
be
the
fire
within
his
heart
the
captain
was
taking
his
fill
of
pleasure
for
once
he
had
danced
many
a
time
with
mary
hamilton
that
spring
in
the
great
houses
of
portsmouth
and
york
and
still
oftener
here
in
berwick
where
he
had
never
felt
his
hostess
so
charming
or
so
approachable
as
at
last
when
the
music
stopped
they
left
the
room
together
while
their
companions
were
still
blushing
at
so
much
applause
and
went
out
through
the
crowded
hall
there
was
a
cry
of
admiration
as
they
passed
among
the
guests
they
were
carried
on
the
swift
current
of
this
evident
delight
and
their
own
excitement
it
is
easy
for
any
girl
to
make
a
hero
of
a
gallant
sailor
any
girl
who
is
wholly
a
patriot
at
heart
to
do
honor
to
the
cordial
ally
of
her
country
they
walked
together
out
of
the
south
door
where
mary
had
so
lately
entered
alone
and
went
across
the
broad
terrace
to
the
balustrade
which
overhung
the
steep
bank
of
the
river
mary
hamilton
was
most
exquisite
to
see
in
the
moonlight
her
dress
softened
and
shimmered
the
more
and
her
eyes
had
a
brightness
now
that
was
lost
in
the
lighted
room
the
captain
was
always
a
man
of
impulse
in
one
moment
more
he
could
have
dared
to
kiss
the
face
that
shone
eager
warm
and
blooming
like
a
flower
close
to
his
own
he
was
not
unskilled
in
but
he
had
never
been
so
fettered
by
the
spell
of
love
itself
or
the
royalty
of
beauty
as
he
was
that
night
this
air
is
very
sweet
after
an
arduous
day
said
he
looking
up
for
an
instant
through
the
elm
boughs
to
the
moon
you
must
be
much
fatigued
sir
captain
said
mary
kindly
she
looked
at
the
moon
longer
than
he
but
looked
at
him
at
last
no
noble
mistress
t
is
fresh
morning
with
me
he
answered
gently
and
added
the
rest
of
the
lovely
words
under
his
breath
as
if
he
said
them
only
to
himself
i
think
that
you
will
never
have
any
mistress
save
glory
said
mary
she
knew
the
tempest
too
but
this
brave
little
man
this
sailor
what
calibans
and
ariels
might
he
not
have
known
this
is
my
last
night
on
land
he
answered
with
affecting
directness
will
you
bid
me
go
my
lonely
way
unblest
or
shall
i
dare
to
say
what
is
in
my
heart
now
my
dear
and
noble
mistress
mary
looked
at
him
with
most
straightforward
earnestness
as
he
spoke
there
was
so
great
a
force
in
her
shining
eyes
that
this
time
it
was
his
own
that
turned
away
will
you
do
a
great
kindness
if
i
ask
you
now
she
begged
him
and
he
promised
with
his
hand
upon
his
heart
you
sail
yes
and
your
image
shall
go
always
with
me
and
smile
at
me
in
a
thousand
gloomy
hours
i
am
often
a
sad
and
lonely
man
upon
the
sea
there
has
been
talk
of
wallingford
s
taking
the
last
commission
how
have
you
learned
what
only
a
few
trusted
men
were
told
the
captain
demanded
fiercely
forgetting
his
play
of
lover
in
a
jealous
guarding
of
high
affairs
i
know
and
by
no
man
s
wrongful
betraying
i
give
you
my
deepest
proof
of
friendship
now
said
the
eager
girl
i
ask
now
if
you
will
befriend
our
neighbor
my
dear
friend
and
playmate
in
childhood
he
has
been
much
misjudged
and
has
come
to
stand
in
danger
with
his
dear
mother
whom
i
love
almost
as
my
own
not
your
young
rascal
of
a
tory
the
captain
interrupted
in
a
towering
rage
i
know
him
to
be
a
rascal
and
a
spy
madam
a
loyal
gentleman
i
believe
him
in
my
heart
said
mary
proudly
but
she
took
a
step
backward
as
they
faced
each
other
a
loyal
gentleman
who
will
serve
our
cause
with
entire
devotion
since
he
gives
his
word
his
hesitations
have
been
the
fault
of
his
advisers
old
men
who
can
not
but
hold
to
early
prejudice
and
narrow
views
with
you
at
sea
his
own
right
instincts
must
be
confirmed
he
will
serve
his
country
well
i
come
to
you
to
beg
from
my
very
heart
that
you
will
stand
his
friend
she
stood
waiting
for
assurance
there
was
a
lovely
smile
on
her
face
it
would
be
like
refusing
some
easy
benefaction
to
a
child
mary
hamilton
knew
her
country
s
troubles
great
and
small
she
had
listened
to
the
most
serious
plans
and
secret
conferences
at
her
brother
s
side
but
the
captain
forgot
all
this
and
only
hated
to
crush
so
innocent
a
childish
hope
he
also
moved
a
step
backward
with
an
impatient
gesture
she
did
not
know
what
she
was
asking
then
still
looking
at
her
he
drew
nearer
than
before
the
captain
was
a
man
of
quick
decisions
he
put
his
arm
about
her
as
if
she
were
a
child
indeed
she
shrank
from
this
but
stood
still
and
waited
for
him
to
speak
my
dear
he
said
speaking
eagerly
so
that
she
must
listen
and
would
not
draw
away
my
dear
you
ask
an
almost
impossible
thing
you
should
see
that
a
suspected
man
were
better
left
ashore
on
such
a
voyage
as
this
do
you
not
discern
that
he
may
even
turn
my
crew
against
me
he
has
been
the
young
squire
and
benefactor
of
a
good
third
of
my
men
and
can
you
not
see
that
i
must
always
be
on
my
guard
but
we
must
not
distrust
his
word
begged
mary
again
a
little
shaken
i
have
followed
the
sea
boy
and
man
since
i
was
twelve
years
old
i
have
been
a
seafarer
all
my
days
said
paul
jones
i
know
all
the
sad
experiences
of
human
nature
that
a
man
may
learn
i
trust
no
man
in
war
and
danger
and
these
days
of
so
far
that
i
am
not
always
on
the
alert
against
treachery
too
many
have
failed
me
whom
i
counted
my
sure
friends
i
am
going
out
now
only
half
trusted
here
at
home
to
the
coasts
where
treason
can
hurt
me
most
i
myself
am
still
a
suspected
and
envied
man
by
those
beneath
me
i
am
given
only
this
poor
ship
after
many
generous
promises
i
fear
a
curse
goes
with
it
you
shall
have
our
hopes
and
prayers
faltered
mary
with
a
quivering
lip
the
bitterness
of
his
speech
moved
her
deepest
feelings
she
was
overstrung
and
she
was
but
a
girl
and
they
stood
in
the
moonlight
together
do
not
ask
me
again
what
i
must
only
deny
you
even
in
this
happy
moment
of
nearness
he
said
sadly
and
watched
her
face
fall
and
all
the
light
go
out
of
it
he
knew
all
that
she
knew
and
even
more
of
wallingford
s
dangerous
position
and
pitied
her
for
a
single
moment
with
all
the
pity
that
belonged
to
his
heart
a
lonely
man
solitary
in
his
very
nature
and
always
foreboding
with
a
kind
of
hopelessness
the
sorrows
that
must
fall
to
him
by
reason
of
an
unkindness
that
his
nature
stirred
in
the
hearts
of
his
fellows
his
very
soul
had
lain
bare
to
her
trusting
look
he
stood
there
for
one
moment
before
mary
hamilton
and
knowing
that
what
he
lacked
was
love
he
was
the
captain
of
the
ranger
it
was
true
that
glory
was
his
mistress
in
that
moment
the
heavens
had
opened
and
his
own
hand
had
shut
the
gates
the
smile
came
back
to
mary
s
face
so
strange
a
flash
of
tenderness
had
brightened
his
own
when
that
unforgettable
light
went
out
she
did
not
know
that
all
the
jealousy
of
a
lonely
heart
began
to
burn
within
him
i
have
changed
my
mind
i
will
take
your
friend
he
said
suddenly
with
a
new
tone
of
authority
and
coldness
and
i
shall
endeavor
to
remember
that
he
is
your
friend
may
i
win
your
faith
and
patience
t
is
a
hard
ploy
then
mary
of
her
own
accord
put
her
hand
into
the
captain
s
and
he
bent
and
kissed
it
i
shall
watch
a
star
in
the
sky
for
you
every
night
she
told
him
and
say
my
prayers
for
the
ranger
till
you
come
sailing
home
god
grant
i
may
tread
the
deck
of
another
and
a
better
ship
said
the
captain
hastily
now
he
was
himself
again
and
again
they
both
heard
the
music
in
the
house
will
you
keep
this
ring
for
me
and
give
me
yours
he
asked
t
will
be
but
a
talisman
to
keep
me
to
my
best
i
am
humble
and
i
ask
no
more
no
said
the
girl
whose
awakened
feeling
assured
her
of
his
own
she
was
with
happiness
she
could
have
thrown
herself
into
the
arms
of
such
a
hero
a
man
so
noble
who
had
done
a
hard
and
unwelcome
thing
for
her
poor
asking
she
had
failed
to
do
him
rightful
honor
until
now
and
this
beautiful
kindness
was
his
revenge
no
she
entreated
him
not
your
own
ring
you
have
done
too
much
for
me
but
if
you
wish
it
i
shall
give
you
mine
t
is
but
a
poor
ring
when
you
have
done
so
great
a
kindness
she
gave
it
as
a
child
might
give
away
a
treasure
not
as
a
woman
gives
who
loves
and
gives
a
ring
for
token
the
captain
sighed
being
no
victor
after
all
his
face
grew
sombre
he
must
try
what
a
great
conqueror
might
do
when
he
came
back
next
year
with
glory
all
his
own
and
yet
again
he
lingered
to
plead
with
her
once
more
dear
mary
he
said
as
he
lifted
her
hand
again
you
will
not
forget
me
i
shall
be
far
from
this
night
and
you
will
remember
that
a
wanderer
like
me
must
sometimes
be
cruel
to
his
own
heart
and
cold
to
the
one
woman
he
truly
loves
something
stirred
now
in
mary
hamilton
s
breast
that
had
always
slept
before
and
frightened
and
disturbed
she
drew
her
hand
away
she
was
like
a
snared
bird
that
he
could
have
pinched
to
death
a
moment
before
now
a
fury
of
disappointment
possessed
him
for
she
was
as
far
away
as
if
she
had
flown
into
the
open
sky
beyond
his
reach
glory
is
your
mistress
it
is
glory
whom
you
must
win
she
whispered
thinking
to
comfort
him
when
i
come
back
he
said
sadly
if
i
come
back
i
hope
that
you
will
have
a
welcome
for
me
he
spoke
formally
now
and
there
was
a
haggard
look
upon
his
face
there
had
come
into
his
heart
a
strange
longing
to
forget
ambition
the
thought
of
his
past
had
strangely
afflicted
him
in
that
clear
moment
of
life
and
vision
but
the
light
faded
the
dark
current
of
his
life
flowed
on
and
there
was
no
reflection
upon
it
of
mary
hamilton
s
sweet
eyes
if
i
carry
that
cursed
young
tory
away
to
sea
he
said
to
himself
i
shall
know
where
he
is
not
here
at
any
rate
to
have
this
angel
for
his
asking
they
were
on
their
way
to
the
house
again
alas
said
paul
jones
once
more
with
a
sad
bitterness
in
his
voice
a
home
like
this
can
never
be
for
me
the
fates
are
my
enemies
let
us
hope
t
is
for
the
happiness
of
others
that
they
lure
me
on
mary
cast
a
piteous
appealing
glance
at
this
lonely
hero
he
was
no
more
the
sea
wolf
or
the
chief
among
ashore
but
an
unloved
unloving
man
conscious
of
heavy
burdens
and
vexed
by
his
very
dreams
at
least
he
could
remember
this
last
kindness
and
her
grateful
heart
colonel
hamilton
was
standing
in
the
wide
hall
with
a
group
of
friends
about
him
old
cæsar
and
his
underservants
were
busy
with
some
silver
trays
the
captain
approached
his
host
with
outstretched
hands
to
speak
his
farewells
i
must
be
off
gentlemen
i
must
take
my
boat
said
he
in
a
manly
tone
that
was
heard
and
repeated
along
the
rooms
it
brought
many
of
the
company
to
their
feet
and
to
surround
him
with
a
new
sense
of
his
high
commission
and
authority
i
ask
again
for
your
kind
wishes
colonel
hamilton
and
yours
justice
and
for
your
blessing
on
my
voyage
reverend
sir
and
saluting
those
of
the
elder
ladies
who
had
been
most
kind
and
kissing
his
hand
to
some
younger
friends
and
partners
of
the
dance
he
turned
to
go
then
with
his
fine
laced
hat
in
hand
the
captain
waved
for
silence
and
hushed
the
friendly
voices
that
would
speak
a
last
word
of
confidence
in
his
high
success
these
friends
of
his
and
mine
who
are
assembled
here
should
know
that
your
neighbor
wallingford
sails
with
me
in
the
morning
i
count
my
crew
well
now
from
your
noble
river
farewell
dear
ladies
farewell
my
good
friends
and
gentlemen
there
was
a
sudden
shout
in
the
hushed
house
and
a
loud
murmur
of
talk
among
the
guests
and
hamilton
himself
stepped
forward
and
began
to
speak
excitedly
but
the
captain
stayed
for
neither
question
nor
answer
and
they
saw
him
go
away
hurriedly
bowing
stiffly
to
either
hand
on
his
way
toward
the
door
mary
had
been
standing
there
with
a
proud
smile
and
gentle
dignity
in
her
look
of
attendance
since
they
had
come
in
together
and
he
stopped
one
moment
more
to
take
her
hand
with
a
low
and
formal
bow
to
lift
it
to
his
lips
and
give
one
quick
regretful
look
at
her
happy
face
then
hamilton
and
some
of
the
younger
men
followed
him
down
through
the
gardens
to
the
boat
landing
the
fleet
tide
of
the
river
was
setting
seaward
the
captain
s
boat
swept
quickly
out
from
shore
and
the
oars
flashed
away
in
the
moonlight
there
were
ladies
on
the
terrace
and
on
the
broad
lookout
of
the
housetop
within
the
high
railing
there
were
rounds
upon
rounds
of
cheers
from
the
men
who
stood
on
the
shore
black
and
white
together
the
captain
turned
once
when
he
was
well
out
into
the
river
bay
and
waved
his
hand
it
was
as
if
the
spectators
were
standing
on
the
edge
of
a
great
future
to
bid
a
hero
hail
and
farewell
the
whole
countryside
was
awake
and
busy
in
the
moonlight
so
late
at
night
as
this
there
were
lights
still
shining
in
one
low
farmhouse
after
another
as
the
captain
went
away
the
large
new
boat
of
the
ranger
was
rowed
by
s
men
in
trim
rig
who
were
leaving
their
homes
on
the
river
shores
for
perhaps
the
last
time
a
second
boat
was
to
join
them
at
stiles
s
cove
heaped
with
sea
chests
and
sailors
bags
the
great
stream
lay
shining
and
still
under
the
moon
a
glorious
track
of
light
lay
ready
to
lead
them
on
and
the
dark
pines
stood
high
on
the
eastern
shore
to
watch
them
pass
the
little
captain
wrapped
in
his
boat
cloak
sat
thoughtful
and
gloomy
at
the
stern
the
gold
lace
glittered
on
his
hat
and
the
new
flag
trailed
aft
this
was
the
first
reach
of
a
voyage
that
would
go
down
in
history
he
was
not
familiar
with
many
of
his
men
but
in
this
hour
he
saw
their
young
faces
before
him
and
remembered
his
own
going
from
home
the
scottish
bay
of
carsethom
the
laird
s
house
at
arbigland
the
far
heights
of
the
cumberland
coast
rose
again
to
the
vision
of
a
hopeful
young
adventurer
to
virginia
and
the
southern
seas
they
could
still
hear
the
music
faint
and
far
away
perhaps
the
girls
were
dancing
again
and
not
weeping
for
poor
jack
the
sailor
but
as
the
men
pulled
at
their
oars
light
in
the
channel
s
flow
and
looked
back
at
the
bright
house
they
saw
a
fire
shining
on
the
shore
at
hamilton
s
word
had
been
passed
that
the
captain
was
going
down
the
crowd
had
gathered
again
they
were
cheering
like
mad
and
the
boys
in
the
boat
yelled
themselves
hoarse
while
some
one
drifting
in
a
skiff
near
by
fired
a
heavy
pistol
which
roused
all
the
river
birds
and
echoed
in
the
river
pines
from
shore
to
shore
huzza
they
were
bringing
refuse
from
the
shipyard
now
and
piling
it
on
the
flame
the
bonfire
towered
high
and
lighted
the
shipping
and
the
reefed
sails
of
the
gundalows
the
steep
roof
of
the
house
with
its
high
dormer
windows
the
leafless
elms
were
all
like
glowing
gold
against
the
blue
height
of
the
sky
the
eagles
waked
and
flew
crying
above
the
river
in
the
strange
light
somebody
was
swinging
a
lantern
from
the
roof
of
hamilton
house
and
then
there
came
a
light
to
an
upper
window
that
had
been
dark
before
and
another
and
another
till
all
the
great
house
was
lit
and
seemed
to
tower
into
the
skies
the
boat
s
crew
leaned
upon
their
oars
drifting
and
losing
way
as
they
tried
to
shout
back
it
cheered
their
brave
hearts
and
sent
them
gayly
on
their
dark
journey
a
moment
before
they
had
thought
heavily
that
some
could
play
and
dance
ashore
while
others
must
go
off
into
the
night
leaving
all
but
the
thought
of
glory
behind
them
the
whole
river
country
was
up
the
old
piscataqua
plantations
had
not
been
so
stirred
since
the
news
came
many
months
before
of
the
peril
of
boston
and
the
fight
at
lexington
when
a
company
had
started
from
saco
and
marched
across
country
gathering
like
a
rolling
snowball
on
its
way
and
with
eben
sullivan
and
nathan
lord
s
berwick
men
had
reached
the
great
bunker
hill
fight
in
good
season
captain
moulton
s
company
had
taken
the
post
road
out
of
old
york
to
join
them
there
was
running
to
and
fro
in
the
country
then
and
a
frenzy
of
haste
of
bawling
orders
of
piteous
leavetakings
of
noisy
drums
and
fifes
and
all
the
confusion
of
war
but
this
was
felt
to
be
almost
as
great
a
moment
and
to
mark
a
still
bolder
challenge
to
the
foreign
foe
there
were
bonfires
on
all
the
river
points
and
hardly
a
farmer
whose
beacon
did
not
answer
to
his
neighbor
s
there
were
shadowy
groups
of
women
standing
on
the
high
banks
against
the
dim
sky
and
crying
shrill
farewells
to
the
boys
in
the
boats
god
speed
the
ranger
god
bless
you
captain
paul
and
one
voice
after
another
took
up
the
cry
boys
boys
they
heard
the
girls
calling
after
them
all
down
the
river
and
saw
new
firelights
brighten
as
they
came
the
boat
now
felt
the
swift
seagoing
current
more
and
more
they
had
passed
high
point
and
the
devil
s
reach
and
the
old
hodgdon
farm
and
the
mouth
of
dover
river
and
at
hodgdon
s
landing
they
had
taken
off
young
humphry
lord
with
his
little
chest
and
his
mother
s
tears
wet
upon
his
coat
they
swept
faster
still
down
past
dover
point
and
the
mouth
of
great
bay
where
a
new
current
caught
them
again
like
a
mill
race
the
fires
were
bright
along
the
kittery
shore
and
the
sound
of
old
portsmouth
bells
came
up
along
the
water
and
soon
they
saw
the
lights
at
rice
s
ferry
and
all
the
leafless
forest
of
idle
shipping
and
came
at
last
to
the
dark
hull
of
the
ranger
lying
in
midstream
sailing
of
the
go
you
with
your
don
quixote
to
your
adventures
and
leave
us
to
our
ill
fortunes
god
will
better
them
for
us
if
we
deserve
it
it
was
a
gray
cold
morning
windy
and
wet
after
the
mild
southerly
airs
of
the
night
before
when
the
day
broke
and
the
heavy
clouds
changed
to
a
paler
hue
there
were
already
many
persons
to
be
seen
waiting
on
the
portsmouth
wharves
there
was
a
subdued
excitement
as
the
crowd
gathered
and
the
hull
and
heavy
spars
of
the
ranger
out
in
the
gray
river
were
hardly
imposing
enough
to
be
the
centre
of
such
general
interest
she
might
have
been
one
of
the
less
noticeable
merchantmen
of
that
busy
port
well
used
to
its
tugging
tides
and
racing
currents
and
looked
like
a
clumsy
until
one
came
near
enough
to
see
that
she
was
built
with
a
gun
deck
and
that
her
ports
were
the
many
shrewd
eyes
of
a
warship
bent
upon
aggression
as
well
as
defense
at
that
early
hour
there
was
a
continual
coming
and
going
between
the
frigate
and
the
shore
and
an
ever
increasing
cluster
of
boats
surrounded
her
there
was
loud
shouting
on
the
river
and
from
the
pier
heads
and
now
and
then
a
round
of
cheers
from
some
excited
portion
of
the
admiring
multitude
there
were
sad
partings
between
the
sailors
and
their
wives
and
mothers
at
the
water
s
edge
and
there
were
sudden
gusts
of
laughter
among
the
idle
the
people
had
come
out
of
the
houses
on
badger
s
island
while
from
newington
and
upper
kittery
the
wherries
were
coming
down
in
a
hurry
most
of
them
strongly
rowed
by
women
with
the
short
stroke
that
jerked
such
boats
steadily
ahead
against
the
wind
or
through
any
river
tide
or
set
of
current
the
old
market
women
bound
for
the
spring
market
in
portsmouth
with
their
autumn
freight
of
geese
and
chickens
and
eggs
rested
on
their
crossed
oars
and
waited
in
midstream
to
see
what
came
of
this
great
excitement
though
they
might
be
late
to
catch
the
best
of
their
early
traffic
some
of
them
drove
a
thriving
trade
and
their
hard
red
apples
were
tossed
from
boat
to
boat
by
rollicking
customers
while
those
that
missed
their
aim
went
bobbing
gay
and
shining
on
the
cold
water
out
to
sea
the
tide
had
now
turned
and
the
noise
of
voices
grew
louder
there
was
a
cold
waft
of
air
from
the
rising
northerly
wind
and
suddenly
everybody
heard
a
shrill
whistle
on
the
ship
and
a
cheer
and
there
was
a
yell
from
the
tangled
boats
before
those
on
shore
could
see
that
the
ranger
s
men
were
lying
out
along
the
yards
and
her
sails
were
being
spread
then
there
were
cheers
indeed
then
there
were
handkerchiefs
and
hats
then
every
boy
and
every
man
who
wished
in
his
heart
to
go
and
fight
great
britain
on
her
own
coasts
split
his
throat
with
trying
to
cheer
louder
than
the
rest
while
even
those
who
had
counseled
prudence
and
delay
felt
the
natural
joy
of
seeing
a
great
ship
spread
her
wings
to
go
to
sea
almost
every
man
and
woman
who
looked
on
knew
some
lad
or
man
who
was
sailing
and
now
there
was
great
shouting
and
running
near
the
slip
where
a
last
boat
was
putting
off
in
haste
there
was
a
young
man
aboard
her
and
many
persons
of
dignity
and
position
were
bidding
him
farewell
the
cheering
grew
louder
at
that
moment
the
slow
bells
began
to
ring
in
john
s
steeple
and
the
old
north
church
there
was
not
a
man
who
knew
his
story
who
did
not
honor
young
wallingford
for
his
bold
and
manly
step
word
had
been
passed
that
he
had
taken
a
commission
and
was
sailing
with
the
rest
but
few
believed
it
he
was
bound
by
family
ties
he
was
endangering
all
future
inheritance
from
old
loyalist
relatives
who
would
rather
see
him
in
jail
than
bent
upon
this
thing
the
only
son
of
his
mother
and
she
a
tory
widow
there
were
reasons
enough
to
keep
any
hero
back
upon
the
narrow
neutral
ground
that
still
remained
and
roger
wallingford
was
not
a
hero
a
plain
gentleman
with
a
good
heart
and
steady
sense
of
honor
he
talked
soberly
with
his
old
friends
and
listened
to
langdon
s
instructions
and
messages
to
france
and
put
some
thick
letters
safely
into
the
pockets
of
his
uniform
which
having
been
made
on
a
venture
with
those
for
other
officers
fitted
him
but
awkwardly
as
he
stood
in
the
boat
nearing
the
frigate
s
side
there
could
hardly
be
a
more
fellow
of
his
age
there
was
in
his
face
all
the
high
breeding
and
character
of
his
house
with
much
personal
courage
and
youthful
expectancy
a
handsome
sword
that
had
been
his
grandfather
s
hung
heavy
from
the
belt
that
dragged
at
his
thin
waist
and
furrowed
deep
the
stiff
new
cloth
of
his
coat
more
than
one
market
woman
in
that
bitter
morning
air
felt
an
unwonted
slackening
in
her
throat
and
could
not
speak
but
blessed
him
over
and
over
in
her
warm
heart
as
her
tears
sprung
quick
to
blur
this
last
sight
of
young
wallingford
going
to
the
wars
here
was
a
chapter
of
romance
though
some
things
in
the
great
struggle
with
england
were
prosaic
enough
there
was
as
much
rebellion
now
against
raising
men
and
money
as
there
had
ever
been
against
the
stamp
act
or
the
hated
duties
the
states
were
trying
to
excuse
themselves
and
to
extort
from
one
another
the
selfish
and
are
ever
to
be
pushed
forward
to
their
public
duties
and
here
in
portsmouth
the
patriots
had
many
a
day
grown
with
despair
the
anchor
broke
ground
at
last
the
ranger
swung
free
and
began
to
drift
the
creak
of
the
cables
and
the
chanty
that
helped
to
wind
them
mingled
now
with
the
noise
of
church
bells
and
the
firing
of
guns
on
the
seaward
forts
at
newcastle
as
wallingford
went
up
the
vessel
s
side
and
stepped
to
the
deck
it
happened
that
the
ranger
fired
her
own
parting
gun
and
the
powder
smoke
blew
thick
in
his
face
when
it
cleared
away
he
saw
the
captain
close
beside
him
and
made
his
proper
salute
then
he
turned
quickly
for
a
last
glimpse
of
his
friends
the
boat
was
still
close
under
the
quarter
and
they
waved
to
him
and
shouted
last
words
that
he
could
not
hear
they
had
been
his
father
s
friends
every
one
wished
to
be
going
too
those
good
gentlemen
it
was
a
splendid
errand
and
they
were
all
brave
men
langdon
and
his
friends
bade
me
say
to
you
and
to
lieutenant
simpson
that
they
meant
to
come
aboard
again
sir
they
were
sorry
to
be
too
late
they
would
have
me
take
breakfast
and
wait
while
they
finished
these
last
dispatches
which
they
send
you
for
franklin
and
adams
i
was
late
from
home
it
has
been
a
sudden
start
for
me
said
the
young
man
impulsively
i
thank
you
for
your
welcome
message
which
i
got
at
two
o
clock
by
the
courier
he
added
with
a
wistful
appeal
in
the
friendliness
of
his
tone
as
one
gentleman
might
speak
with
another
in
such
case
i
had
further
business
with
them
exclaimed
the
superior
officer
they
owed
it
to
me
to
board
me
long
ago
instead
of
dallying
with
your
breakfast
damn
your
breakfast
mr
wallingford
he
said
angrily
and
turned
his
back
i
left
them
and
the
shore
at
three
in
the
morning
i
have
been
at
my
affairs
all
night
go
below
sir
he
commanded
the
new
lieutenant
fiercely
now
you
have
no
pomposities
to
wait
upon
and
admire
you
you
had
best
begin
to
learn
something
of
your
duties
get
you
down
and
fall
to
work
sir
go
to
simpson
for
orders
wallingford
looked
like
an
icicle
under
the
droop
of
the
great
mainsail
he
gazed
with
wonder
and
pity
at
the
piqued
and
wearied
little
man
then
his
face
grew
crimson
and
saluting
the
captain
stiffly
he
went
at
once
below
there
was
many
a
friendly
greeting
and
warm
handshake
waiting
for
him
between
decks
but
these
could
please
him
little
just
then
he
made
his
way
to
the
narrow
cabin
cluttered
and
piled
high
with
his
sea
kit
and
hasty
provisionings
and
sat
there
in
the
dim
light
until
prevailed
when
he
came
on
deck
again
they
were
going
out
of
the
lower
harbor
with
a
following
wind
straight
to
sea
he
may
have
gone
below
a
boy
but
he
came
on
deck
a
man
sir
william
pepperrell
s
stately
house
with
the
deer
park
and
gardens
and
row
of
already
decaying
warehouses
looked
drowsy
with
age
on
kittery
point
and
opposite
hiding
away
in
little
harbor
was
the
rambling
huge
old
mansion
of
the
wentworths
with
its
fine
council
chamber
and
handsome
where
he
had
danced
many
a
night
with
the
pretty
portsmouth
girls
all
roger
wallingford
s
youth
and
pleasantries
were
left
behind
him
now
the
summer
nights
were
ended
the
winter
feasts
if
there
were
any
that
dreary
year
must
go
on
without
him
the
isles
of
shoals
lay
ahead
like
pieces
of
frozen
drift
ill
the
early
morning
light
and
the
great
sea
stretched
away
to
the
horizon
bleak
and
cold
and
far
a
stormy
road
to
france
the
ship
heading
out
into
the
waste
of
water
took
a
steady
movement
between
wind
and
wave
and
a
swinging
gait
that
seemed
to
deny
at
every
moment
the
possibility
of
return
the
gray
shore
sank
and
narrowed
to
a
line
behind
her
at
last
the
long
blue
hill
in
northwood
and
the
three
hills
of
agamenticus
were
seen
like
islands
and
long
before
noon
these
also
had
sunk
behind
the
waves
and
the
ranger
was
well
at
sea
major
s
but
see
how
merciful
heaven
sends
relief
in
the
greatest
distresses
for
now
comes
don
gayferos
the
haggens
house
with
its
square
chimneys
and
a
broad
look
of
comfort
like
those
who
were
sheltered
under
its
roof
stood
facing
the
whole
southern
country
just
where
the
two
roads
joined
from
the
upper
settlements
a
double
stream
of
travel
and
traffic
flowed
steadily
by
this
corner
toward
the
upper
and
lower
landings
of
the
tide
river
from
the
huge
square
stone
that
floored
a
pointed
porch
of
severely
classic
design
could
be
seen
a
fine
sweep
of
land
from
the
butlers
hill
on
the
left
over
the
high
oak
woods
of
a
second
height
to
the
deep
pasture
valleys
major
hight
s
new
house
and
huge
sentinel
pines
stood
on
a
ridge
beyond
with
the
river
itself
showing
a
gleam
of
silver
here
and
there
all
along
the
low
lands
toward
portsmouth
across
the
country
westward
was
the
top
of
garrison
hill
at
dover
to
the
south
was
the
dark
region
of
the
rocky
hills
it
was
a
wide
and
splendid
prospect
even
on
a
bleak
autumn
day
and
major
haggens
the
socially
minded
master
of
the
house
was
trying
hard
to
enjoy
it
as
he
sat
in
the
morning
wind
wrapped
in
his
red
cloak
and
longing
for
proper
companionship
he
cast
imploring
glances
across
the
way
to
the
habitation
of
his
only
near
neighbor
rogers
but
he
could
see
the
old
gentleman
sitting
fast
asleep
at
that
ridiculous
hour
of
the
morning
behind
a
closed
window
there
was
no
one
to
be
seen
up
the
road
where
jenkins
s
place
of
business
was
apt
to
attract
the
idle
especially
in
the
harvest
time
of
his
famous
early
apples
these
were
dull
days
before
the
war
there
were
few
mornings
of
the
year
when
the
broad
space
before
the
major
s
house
lacked
either
carriages
or
for
half
an
hour
in
winter
the
two
roads
were
blocked
as
far
as
a
man
could
see
with
the
long
processions
of
ox
teams
laden
with
heavy
timber
which
had
come
from
fifty
or
even
a
hundred
miles
back
in
the
north
country
there
were
hundreds
of
trees
standing
yet
in
the
great
forests
of
the
white
hills
that
were
marked
with
the
deeply
cut
king
s
arrow
but
the
winter
snows
of
many
years
to
come
were
likely
to
find
these
timber
pines
for
the
king
s
shipyards
still
standing
the
busy
days
of
the
past
seemed
to
be
gone
forever
and
poverty
and
uncertainty
had
replaced
them
there
was
no
such
market
anywhere
for
berwick
timber
as
england
had
always
been
the
berwick
merchants
would
be
prosperous
no
more
the
town
must
live
long
now
upon
their
hoarded
gains
and
then
seek
for
some
other
means
of
living
the
old
major
looked
downcast
and
gave
a
deep
sigh
he
had
no
such
remembrance
of
the
earlier
wars
when
old
england
and
new
england
had
fought
together
against
a
common
enemy
those
battles
had
been
exciting
enough
and
a
short
and
evident
path
to
glory
where
his
fellow
colonists
had
felt
something
of
the
happy
certainties
of
the
old
testament
jews
and
went
out
boldly
to
hew
agag
in
pieces
and
to
smite
the
amalekites
hip
and
thigh
it
appeared
now
as
if
with
all
its
hardships
war
had
been
a
not
unwelcome
relief
to
a
dull
level
of
prosperity
and
the
narrowness
of
a
domestic
horizon
war
gave
a
man
the
pleasures
of
travel
it
was
a
man
s
natural
business
and
outlet
of
energy
but
war
with
moral
enemies
and
for
opinion
s
sake
lacked
the
old
color
and
made
the
faces
of
those
who
stayed
at
home
grow
sullen
they
were
backbiting
hamilton
in
many
a
pious
household
that
morning
for
giving
a
farewell
feast
to
paul
jones
t
was
all
of
a
piece
with
roundhead
days
and
christening
a
child
by
such
names
as
must
have
depressed
barebones
and
little
kilgore
who
was
a
neighbor
of
the
major
s
down
the
landing
hill
the
major
s
sound
but
lately
unpracticed
head
was
a
little
heavy
from
the
last
night
s
supper
and
the
world
seemed
to
him
badly
out
of
joint
he
was
a
patriot
at
heart
but
one
who
stood
among
the
moderates
he
seemed
uneasy
in
his
wooden
armchair
and
pushed
the
ferule
of
his
stout
old
cane
angrily
into
a
crevice
below
one
of
the
corinthian
pillars
of
the
porch
his
tall
sister
who
by
virtue
of
two
years
precedence
in
age
resolutely
maintained
the
position
of
superior
officer
had
already
once
or
twice
opened
the
door
behind
to
advise
him
to
come
in
out
of
the
cold
wind
the
chill
might
very
well
send
him
an
attack
of
gout
in
the
stomach
i
ve
got
no
gout
to
send
nor
any
stomach
to
send
it
to
returned
the
major
angrily
what
s
the
use
of
a
stomach
when
a
man
can
get
nothing
decent
to
put
into
it
and
has
not
even
a
dog
to
keep
him
company
i
d
welcome
even
a
tax
gatherer
the
great
door
was
shut
again
with
decision
enough
to
clack
the
oval
brass
knocker
and
the
major
finished
some
protests
against
fate
deep
in
his
own
disparaged
interior
and
punctuated
his
inarticulate
grumbles
by
angry
bobs
of
the
head
he
was
really
too
cold
but
he
would
not
submit
to
nancy
or
let
her
think
that
she
could
rule
him
as
she
seemed
to
wish
suddenly
there
was
something
moving
down
at
the
end
of
the
street
it
came
up
quickly
over
the
slope
into
the
full
appearance
of
a
horse
and
rider
and
hope
filled
the
major
s
once
sorrowful
mind
jack
hamilton
by
zounds
laughed
the
old
gentleman
he
s
late
on
his
way
up
country
i
ll
stretch
a
point
we
ll
make
it
an
hour
earlier
and
have
our
toddy
now
it
must
be
after
ten
hamilton
presently
declared
that
he
was
too
much
belated
he
must
go
to
the
far
regions
of
where
he
owned
great
tracts
of
woodland
he
really
must
not
vex
his
conscience
by
loitering
here
you
cuffee
here
pollo
you
lazy
dog
the
major
called
merely
turning
his
head
so
that
his
voice
might
reach
round
the
house
through
the
long
yard
to
his
barns
and
after
a
moment
s
consideration
hamilton
dismounted
unwillingly
the
gay
creature
he
had
ridden
sidled
away
and
whinnied
fretfully
as
if
she
also
objected
to
such
an
interruption
of
their
plans
keep
her
here
i
shall
not
stop
long
said
the
colonel
to
a
black
namesake
of
the
great
god
apollo
who
was
the
first
to
arrive
and
although
breathless
began
to
walk
to
and
fro
sentry
fashion
as
if
by
automatic
impulse
the
already
heated
young
mare
was
nosing
his
shoulder
with
an
air
of
intimacy
and
nipping
at
the
edge
of
his
frayed
hat
you
ll
be
just
far
enough
from
both
dinner
and
breakfast
now
insisted
the
major
stamping
along
through
the
handsome
cold
hall
of
the
house
with
its
elaborate
panelings
of
clear
uupainted
pine
you
ll
get
to
or
lebanon
as
the
new
folks
want
to
call
it
all
the
sooner
for
this
delay
you
ve
pounded
the
first
wind
out
of
that
colt
already
you
d
have
had
her
sobbing
on
plaisted
s
hill
what
we
can
t
find
in
eatables
we
ll
make
up
in
drinkables
nancy
nancy
where
s
my
spirit
case
you
re
so
precise
i
never
can
find
anything
where
i
leave
it
the
case
is
on
the
top
of
the
sideboard
directly
in
the
middle
brother
tilly
said
miss
nancy
politely
coming
out
of
the
room
on
the
right
and
looking
after
him
with
her
knitting
in
hand
hamilton
turned
and
she
dropped
a
somewhat
informal
curtsy
she
wore
a
plain
turban
which
gave
her
a
severe
but
most
distinguished
air
miss
haggens
was
quite
the
great
lady
and
even
more
french
in
her
appearance
than
the
major
himself
i
was
sorry
to
miss
the
gayeties
last
night
she
said
the
major
is
boyish
enough
for
anything
and
can
answer
every
beck
and
call
but
i
felt
that
i
must
not
venture
i
was
sorry
when
it
proved
so
fine
an
evening
no
becks
and
calls
to
answer
in
these
days
insisted
the
busy
host
t
would
do
you
good
nancy
as
it
did
all
the
rest
of
us
let
s
have
it
in
the
i
left
a
good
fire
there
if
there
s
no
hot
water
i
ll
heat
some
quick
enough
in
a
porringer
hamilton
following
seated
himself
slowly
in
an
armchair
by
the
fireplace
the
processes
of
hospitality
would
be
swifter
if
quietly
acquiesced
in
and
now
that
the
slim
decanter
of
santa
cruz
was
opened
the
odor
was
not
unwelcome
he
bad
been
busy
enough
since
daybreak
but
wore
an
amused
look
though
somewhat
tired
and
worried
as
the
major
flew
about
like
a
captive
bumblebee
miss
nancy
s
prim
turban
got
shifted
over
one
ear
and
one
white
and
two
black
handmaidens
joined
her
in
the
course
of
such
important
affairs
at
last
the
major
reappeared
victorious
and
irate
with
a
steaming
porringer
which
had
just
begun
to
heat
in
the
kitchen
fireplace
and
splashed
it
all
the
way
along
the
floor
he
went
down
stiffly
on
his
knees
in
the
to
blow
the
coals
with
such
mighty
puffs
that
a
film
of
ashes
at
once
covered
the
water
and
retarded
its
rise
of
temperature
miss
nancy
and
colonel
hamilton
looked
at
each
other
across
his
broad
back
and
laughed
there
there
major
the
steam
s
rising
and
t
will
do
already
urged
the
colonel
i
d
rather
not
take
my
drink
too
hot
and
go
out
again
to
face
the
wind
i
felt
the
wind
myself
acknowledged
the
major
looking
up
pleasantly
my
fore
door
where
i
like
to
sit
is
well
sheltered
but
i
felt
the
wind
miss
nancy
so
far
descended
from
her
usual
lofty
dignity
as
to
make
a
little
face
which
hamilton
being
a
man
did
not
exactly
understand
i
like
to
have
the
water
boiling
hot
then
you
can
let
it
cool
away
and
the
flavor
s
well
brought
out
explained
the
major
phoebe
the
old
slave
woman
who
looked
over
his
shoulder
now
pronounced
with
satisfaction
that
the
water
was
minnying
with
the
steam
all
in
it
to
which
her
master
agreed
miss
nancy
put
out
a
strong
hand
and
helped
him
to
his
feet
you
ve
set
your
turban
all
awry
sister
the
major
remarked
politely
by
way
of
revenge
and
the
little
company
burst
into
a
hearty
laugh
miss
nancy
produced
a
gay
china
plate
of
pound
cakes
from
the
cupboard
and
sat
by
in
silence
discreetly
knitting
until
the
toddy
was
not
only
made
but
half
gone
down
the
gentlemen
s
throats
and
so
roger
wallingford
s
gone
to
sea
and
those
who
would
burn
him
in
his
house
for
a
tory
are
robbed
of
a
great
pleasure
she
said
at
last
i
wonder
what
their
feelings
are
my
heart
aches
for
his
mother
t
will
be
a
deathblow
to
all
her
pride
it
will
indeed
said
hamilton
seriously
i
was
sore
afraid
of
his
joining
the
other
side
only
yesterday
said
the
major
but
this
news
has
lain
heavy
as
lead
on
me
all
the
morning
there
are
those
aboard
the
ranger
who
will
only
have
him
for
a
spy
i
heard
a
whisper
of
this
last
night
before
we
parted
i
was
even
glad
to
think
that
the
poor
boy
has
plenty
of
old
family
friends
in
england
who
can
serve
him
if
worst
comes
to
worst
t
was
in
my
mind
too
agreed
the
colonel
john
lord
was
hinting
at
trouble
in
my
this
morning
early
i
fancied
him
more
than
half
glad
on
his
own
account
that
wallingford
is
gone
the
lads
have
looked
upon
each
other
as
rivals
and
i
have
suspected
that
t
was
roger
who
was
leading
in
the
race
the
colonel
s
cheeks
brightened
still
more
as
he
spoke
and
looked
up
with
an
expectant
smile
at
miss
nancy
who
did
not
reply
except
by
giving
two
or
three
solemn
nods
of
her
turbaned
head
everybody
loves
the
boy
she
said
presently
but
t
is
of
his
dear
mother
i
am
thinking
most
t
is
a
sad
heart
alone
in
her
great
house
to
front
the
winter
weather
she
told
me
last
week
that
she
had
a
mind
not
to
make
the
usual
change
to
her
house
in
town
there
were
like
to
be
disturbances
and
she
had
no
mind
for
anything
but
quiet
i
shall
write
myself
to
her
young
cousins
in
boston
or
to
the
sherburnes
who
are
near
friends
and
beg
them
to
visit
her
tis
none
so
cheerful
in
boston
either
now
we
were
always
together
in
our
youth
but
age
makes
us
poor
winter
comrades
sit
ye
down
said
miss
nancy
haggens
affectionately
as
hamilton
rose
and
put
by
his
empty
glass
and
how
is
our
dear
mary
she
asked
as
she
rose
also
finding
him
determined
there
was
an
eager
look
in
the
old
lady
s
eyes
i
have
not
seen
my
sister
answered
hamilton
looking
grave
i
was
very
early
by
the
riverside
with
my
old
brig
pactolus
going
downstream
and
everything
and
everybody
tardy
i
shall
lay
her
up
for
the
winter
by
christian
shore
but
as
things
look
now
i
fear
t
is
the
last
voyage
of
the
good
old
vessel
i
stood
and
watched
her
away
and
when
she
made
the
turn
past
pine
point
it
seemed
as
if
her
old
topmasts
were
looking
back
at
me
wishfully
above
the
woods
the
major
made
a
sound
which
was
meant
for
sympathy
he
was
very
warm
and
peaceful
now
before
the
fire
my
sister
will
not
be
long
seeking
such
a
friend
as
you
said
hamilton
with
sudden
change
of
tone
and
looking
at
miss
nancy
with
an
unwonted
show
of
sentiment
and
concern
in
his
usually
impassive
face
i
slept
but
little
last
night
and
my
fears
small
and
great
did
not
sleep
at
all
t
is
heavy
news
from
the
army
and
i
am
perplexed
as
to
mary
s
real
feelings
the
captain
counts
upon
success
as
for
the
step
that
roger
wallingford
has
taken
it
has
no
doubt
averted
a
very
real
danger
of
the
moment
she
must
go
at
once
to
see
his
mother
i
wish
that
she
might
go
you
may
tell
mary
this
with
the
love
of
an
old
friend
said
miss
nancy
warningly
she
has
great
reserve
of
feeling
with
all
her
pretty
frankness
but
young
hearts
are
not
easy
reading
i
must
be
gone
all
day
said
hamilton
gravely
for
once
the
major
listened
and
had
no
opinion
ready
all
the
troubles
of
life
had
been
lifted
in
the
exercise
of
such
instant
hospitality
we
must
leave
all
to
time
he
announced
cheerfully
no
man
regrets
more
than
i
our
country
s
sad
situation
and
mark
ye
both
the
captain
of
the
ranger
s
got
all
the
makings
of
a
hero
lord
bless
me
he
exclaimed
as
he
followed
hamilton
along
the
hall
i
could
have
shed
tears
as
i
caught
his
fire
at
thinking
i
was
too
old
and
heavy
to
ship
with
him
myself
i
might
be
useful
yet
with
his
raw
marines
and
in
the
land
attacks
i
felt
last
night
as
our
talk
went
on
that
i
should
be
as
good
for
soldiering
as
ever
brother
tilly
miss
nancy
was
crying
from
the
in
despair
oh
don
t
go
out
into
the
wind
and
you
so
warm
with
your
toddy
wait
i
command
you
tilly
phoebe
s
coming
with
your
hat
and
cloak
but
the
old
campaigner
was
already
out
beyond
the
lilacs
in
the
front
yard
with
the
rising
northwester
lifting
his
gray
locks
and
all
thoughts
all
passions
all
delights
whatever
stirs
this
mortal
frame
all
are
but
ministers
of
love
and
feed
his
sacred
flame
that
same
afternoon
of
the
first
of
november
one
might
have
thought
that
the
adventurers
on
board
the
ranger
had
taken
all
the
pleasant
weather
away
with
them
and
all
the
pleasure
and
interest
of
life
only
endurance
and
the
bleak
chilliness
of
autumn
seemed
to
be
left
ashore
the
wind
changed
into
the
east
as
night
drew
on
and
a
cold
fog
gathered
along
the
coast
came
drifting
up
the
river
with
the
tide
until
rain
began
to
fall
with
the
early
dark
the
poplars
and
elms
looked
shrunken
about
the
gardens
at
hamilton
s
and
the
house
but
ill
lighted
the
great
rooms
themselves
were
cold
and
empty
colonel
hamilton
gloomy
with
further
bad
news
from
the
army
on
long
island
sat
alone
reviewing
some
accounts
shaking
his
head
over
a
great
ledger
which
had
been
brought
up
from
the
and
lay
before
him
on
a
table
in
the
west
room
the
large
russian
stove
was
lighted
for
the
first
time
that
year
and
the
tiny
grate
glowed
bright
in
its
tall
front
which
was
as
slow
to
give
out
any
heat
as
a
new
england
winter
to
give
place
to
spring
the
pair
of
candles
gave
a
dull
yellow
light
and
the
very
air
of
the
west
room
looked
misty
about
them
in
a
sort
of
halo
as
mary
hamilton
opened
the
door
she
was
rosy
with
color
from
an
afternoon
ride
while
her
brother
looked
tired
and
dull
all
the
long
day
she
had
been
so
much
in
his
anxious
thoughts
that
he
glanced
over
his
shoulder
with
apprehension
in
spite
of
his
grave
face
and
unyielding
temper
he
had
a
quick
imagination
and
for
the
few
persons
whom
he
loved
a
most
tender
heart
to
his
blank
surprise
his
young
sister
had
never
worn
a
more
spirited
or
cheerful
look
she
was
no
lovelorn
maiden
and
had
come
to
him
for
neither
pity
nor
anxious
confidence
she
came
instead
to
stand
close
beside
him
with
a
firm
warm
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
smiling
looked
into
his
upturned
face
well
sir
have
you
made
the
most
of
a
bad
day
she
asked
in
the
tone
of
comradeship
which
always
went
straight
to
hamilton
s
heart
and
made
him
feel
like
a
lover
they
must
have
had
a
good
offshore
wind
for
many
hours
she
added
before
he
could
answer
the
ranger
must
be
safe
off
the
coast
by
this
time
and
out
of
this
hindering
fog
she
must
indeed
answered
hamilton
lending
himself
comfortably
to
her
mood
the
wind
was
free
all
day
out
of
the
northwest
until
this
easterly
chill
at
sundown
they
will
not
like
to
drift
in
a
long
calm
and
easterly
fog
come
you
look
miserable
here
you
are
pale
with
cold
yourself
jack
she
urged
kindly
let
us
poke
this
slow
contrivance
for
a
fire
i
like
to
see
a
broad
blaze
cæsar
kept
me
a
fine
hoard
of
roots
when
they
cleared
that
thicket
of
the
upper
pasture
and
i
made
a
noble
heat
with
them
just
now
in
my
own
room
i
told
him
to
look
after
your
stove
here
but
he
was
sulky
he
seems
to
think
t
is
a
volcano
in
a
box
and
may
wreck
the
house
and
all
his
happiness
see
it
was
full
of
ashes
at
the
draught
sir
may
i
ask
what
you
are
laughing
at
i
thought
you
would
be
like
niobe
all
tears
he
answered
boldly
giving
her
a
half
amused
half
curious
glance
and
here
you
praise
the
wind
that
blows
your
lover
seaward
and
make
yourself
snug
ashore
the
firelight
flashed
in
mary
s
face
at
that
moment
and
something
else
flashed
back
to
meet
it
she
was
kneeling
close
to
the
small
iron
door
as
if
she
were
before
a
confessional
but
she
looked
over
her
shoulder
for
a
moment
with
a
quick
smile
that
had
great
sweetness
and
power
to
charm
let
us
be
happy
together
my
dear
she
said
they
go
to
serve
our
country
it
should
be
a
day
for
high
hopes
and
not
for
mourning
i
look
for
great
gallantry
on
board
the
ranger
she
stood
facing
her
brother
a
moment
later
and
looked
straight
in
his
face
as
if
she
had
no
fears
of
any
curious
gaze
simply
unconscious
of
self
as
if
no
great
shock
had
touched
her
heart
in
either
happiness
or
sense
of
loss
it
seemed
as
if
her
cheerful
were
putting
a
bar
to
all
confidence
i
can
not
understand
you
he
exclaimed
sharply
you
are
cold
and
tired
my
poor
old
man
come
i
shall
have
no
more
figuring
and
she
slid
away
the
ledger
beyond
his
reach
on
the
smooth
polished
oak
of
the
table
top
let
us
make
a
bit
of
hot
drink
for
so
cold
a
man
and
was
swiftly
gone
across
the
hall
to
the
great
kitchen
leaving
the
doors
wide
open
behind
her
it
seemed
warmer
at
once
and
presently
the
sound
of
laughter
and
a
coaxing
voice
made
hamilton
s
heart
a
little
gayer
old
peggy
and
her
young
mistress
were
in
the
midst
of
a
lively
encounter
and
presently
a
noise
of
open
war
made
him
cross
the
hall
with
boyish
eagerness
to
see
the
fray
peggy
was
having
a
glorious
moment
of
proud
resistance
and
did
not
deign
to
notice
the
spectator
the
combatants
stood
facing
each
other
in
front
of
the
huge
fireplace
where
there
was
a
high
heap
of
ashes
and
but
faint
glow
of
fire
the
old
woman
s
voice
was
harsh
and
she
looked
pale
and
desperate
there
was
always
a
black
day
for
the
household
after
such
a
masterpiece
of
a
feast
as
peggy
had
set
before
her
master
s
guests
the
night
before
the
fire
of
energy
was
low
in
her
gaunt
frame
except
for
a
saving
spark
that
still
moved
the
engines
of
her
tongue
she
stood
like
a
thin
old
boadicea
with
arms
akimbo
and
mary
hamilton
faced
her
all
abloom
with
a
face
full
of
laughter
and
in
exactly
the
same
attitude
it
was
a
pleasing
sight
to
hamilton
at
the
door
of
the
side
hall
the
usually
populous
kitchen
was
deserted
of
all
peggy
s
minions
except
cæsar
and
there
were
no
signs
of
any
preliminaries
of
even
the
latest
supper
oh
peggy
what
a
cross
old
thing
you
are
sighed
mary
at
the
end
of
peggy
s
remarks
upon
the
text
of
there
being
nobody
in
the
house
to
do
anything
save
herself
i
should
really
love
to
stay
and
have
a
good
battle
to
warm
us
up
except
that
we
should
both
be
near
to
weeping
when
it
was
done
and
you
would
be
sorrier
than
you
need
and
cook
something
much
too
nice
for
supper
tired
as
you
are
then
she
dropped
her
hands
and
relaxed
her
mocking
pose
come
peggy
dear
the
colonel
s
here
and
he
s
ridden
the
whole
length
of
beech
ridge
and
the
woods
since
morning
with
his
surveyors
he
s
very
cold
and
and
i
only
want
a
spatter
of
mulled
wine
for
him
come
find
me
a
little
skillet
and
we
ll
heat
it
here
on
the
coals
see
they
re
winking
bright
under
that
hill
of
ashes
where
are
all
the
maids
in
their
beds
i
suppose
black
and
white
alike
and
getting
their
first
sleep
like
ladies
grumbled
peggy
i
told
them
the
master
would
be
late
and
would
sup
at
pine
hill
as
he
said
this
morning
t
is
no
matter
about
me
cæsar
and
me
we
re
old
and
tough
and
the
stern
features
relaxed
a
little
why
did
n
t
you
tell
me
t
was
for
the
master
an
he
d
no
supper
after
such
a
day
with
the
clock
far
past
seven
and
you
yourself
with
nothing
but
bread
and
milk
to
stay
you
truth
to
tell
i
was
asleep
in
the
corner
of
the
settle
here
and
a
spark
s
burnt
me
a
hole
in
this
good
apron
and
spoilt
my
temper
you
have
too
much
patience
with
poor
old
peggy
she
muttered
bending
over
the
ashes
and
raking
them
open
to
their
bright
life
with
her
hard
brown
hand
mary
stood
watching
her
for
a
moment
a
quick
change
came
over
her
face
and
she
turned
away
silently
and
went
toward
the
window
as
if
to
look
up
the
river
what
was
you
designin
to
get
for
supper
old
cæsar
humbly
inquired
at
this
auspicious
moment
i
mought
be
of
the
table
but
peggy
did
not
notice
him
he
was
still
in
a
place
of
safety
behind
the
settle
his
gray
head
just
appearing
over
the
high
back
we
might
finish
the
pigeon
pie
the
young
mistress
suggested
the
colonel
will
like
a
bit
of
cheese
afterward
and
plenty
of
bread
mind
peggy
tis
only
a
cold
supper
was

any
of
the
quality
aside

missy
politely
demanded
cæsar
in
the
simple
exercise
of
his
duty

gallery

peggy
laughed
in
spite
of
herself

out
from
there
an
fetch

some
dry
pine
chips
if
t
won
t
demean
your
dignity
i
ll
ax
you
some
questions
you
don
t
know
no
answers
to
if
you
be
an
afriky
potentate
the
master
of
the
house
had
tiptoed
back
across
the
hall
like
a
pleased
schoolboy
and
was
busy
with
the
ledger
when
his
sister
came
back
a
few
minutes
later
with
a
steaming
porringer
she
proceeded
to
mix
a
most
fragrant
potion
in
a
large
gayly
flowered
glass
while
hamilton
described
his
morning
entertainment
by
the
major
then
an
old
dog
came
loitering
in
and
watched
his
master
enviously
as
he
drank
and
stirred
again
and
praised
the
warm
drink
and
grew
every
moment
more
cheerful
mary
hamilton
stood
leaning
against
the
russian
stove
it
is
just
getting
warm
now
this
dull
old
idol
of
yours
she
said
and
we
can
not
cool
it
before
spring
we
ll
sit
in
the
dining
parlor
after
supper
you
shall
smoke
your
pipe
there
and
i
can
see
the
good
firelight
we
are
lonesome
after
a
gay
day
and
night
like
yesterday
we
have
had
no
word
of
gossip
yet
about
our
ball
i
have
many
things
to
tell
you
hamilton
nodded
amiably
the
color
had
come
back
into
his
face
and
driven
away
the
worn
and
worried
look
that
had
fallen
on
him
before
his
time
he
had
made
so
light
of
care
that
care
made
light
of
him
and
was
beginning
to
weigh
his
spirit
down
early
in
middle
life
i
came
across
the
river
at
the
great
falls
he
said
not
without
effort
and
looking
at
his
young
sister
the
roads
were
so
heavy
through
the
woods
by
cranberry
meadow
so
you
did
n
t
stop
to
give
granny
sullivan
the
money
asked
mary
as
if
she
were
disappointed
yes
on
my
way
this
morning
she
knew
more
about
last
night
than
i
could
sweep
together
to
tell
her
if
i
had
stayed
an
hour
the
birds
tell
granny
everything
said
mary
laughing
she
gave
me
a
handsome
scolding
the
other
day
because
peggy
s
rack
of
spiced
hams
had
fallen
in
the
ashes
that
very
morning
how
was
the
master
very
absentminded
and
reading
his
horace
as
if
the
old
poet
were
new
he
did
not
even
look
up
while
she
thanked
me
for
the
money
the
judge
had
sent
i
m
knitting
every
minute
i
m
not
working
or
eating
for
my
poor
lame
lad
jamie
she
said
now
he
has
nothing
to
do
but
read
his
law
books
an
tell
others
what
s
in
them
and
grow
rich
t
is
all
because
his
father
s
such
a
gentleman
how
proud
she
is
the
dear
old
woman
said
mary
warmly
yes
and
they
have
the
sense
to
be
proud
of
her
said
hamilton
settling
into
his
chair
more
comfortably
and
putting
his
empty
glass
aside
i
rode
to
the
rocky
hills
myself
late
this
afternoon
i
heard
that
elder
shackley
had
been
ill
i
liked
the
fresh
wind
and
wet
after
last
night
s
warmth
and
a
busy
morning
here
in
the
house
i
meant
at
first
to
ride
north
to
meet
you
but
it
was
better
not
since
you
crossed
at
the
falls
i
thought
you
would
go
another
way
said
hamilton
seriously
there
were
moments
when
he
seemed
old
enough
to
be
her
father
there
were
indeed
many
years
between
them
there
is
a
sad
heart
and
a
lonely
one
across
the
river
while
we
seem
gay
enough
together
mary
s
face
changed
quickly
she
stepped
toward
him
and
seated
herself
on
the
broad
arm
of
the
chair
and
drew
her
brother
s
head
close
against
her
side
what
is
it
that
you
wish
to
say
to
me
she
asked
i
have
been
thinking
of
dear
madam
wallingford
all
day
long
and
hamilton
could
feel
her
young
heart
beating
quick
like
a
bird
s
close
to
his
ear
she
was
in
my
mind
too
i
came
down
that
side
of
the
river
to
see
her
but
it
grew
so
rainy
and
late
that
i
gave
up
my
thought
of
stopping
except
to
leave
a
message
my
mare
was
very
hot
and
spent
he
explained
in
a
way
as
i
came
toward
the
house
i
saw
my
lady
standing
at
a
window
and
she
beckoned
me
she
came
herself
to
the
door
and
the
wind
blew
her
to
and
fro
like
a
flag
she
had
been
weeping
terribly
i
longed
to
see
a
friend
she
told
me
and
could
say
no
more
i
feared
that
she
might
bear
us
much
ill
will
hamilton
was
so
full
of
feeling
that
his
own
voice
failed
him
and
mary
did
not
speak
at
first
well
dear
brother
she
asked
a
moment
later
knowing
that
he
had
more
to
say
she
wished
to
send
you
a
message
t
was
her
reason
for
calling
me
in
she
asked
if
you
would
not
come
to
see
her
late
in
the
afternoon
earlier
she
has
business
of
the
estate
to
manage
in
place
of
her
son
there
are
men
coming
down
from
the
lake
oh
yes
yes
i
shall
go
said
mary
with
a
sob
oh
i
am
so
glad
i
feared
that
her
heart
was
broken
and
that
she
would
only
hate
us
i
was
afraid
too
returned
hamilton
and
he
took
his
sister
s
hand
gently
in
his
own
and
would
have
spoken
something
that
she
could
not
bear
to
hear
she
moved
away
quickly
come
dear
man
she
said
you
must
throw
off
these
muddy
clothes
you
are
warm
again
now
and
they
will
soon
be
calling
us
to
supper
he
sighed
and
looked
at
her
in
bewilderment
as
he
obeyed
she
had
gone
to
the
window
and
pushed
the
shutter
back
and
was
gazing
out
into
the
dark
night
he
looked
at
her
again
as
he
was
going
out
of
the
room
but
still
she
did
not
speak
was
it
the
captain
after
all
who
had
gone
away
with
her
heart
she
had
not
even
mentioned
his
name
she
was
not
always
so
silent
about
her
lovers
they
had
been
many
and
she
sometimes
spoke
frankly
enough
when
he
and
she
were
alone
together
like
this
and
the
troubles
and
veils
of
intercourse
were
all
put
aside
but
who
could
read
a
woman
s
heart
certainly
not
a
poor
bachelor
who
had
never
yet
learned
to
read
his
own
wind
and
whose
daughters
ye
are
as
long
as
ye
do
well
and
are
not
afraid
with
any
amazement
late
the
next
afternoon
mary
hamilton
appeared
at
the
north
door
of
the
house
and
went
quickly
down
the
steep
garden
side
toward
the
water
in
the
shallow
slip
between
two
large
wharves
lay
some
idle
rowboats
which
belonged
to
workmen
who
came
every
morning
from
up
and
down
the
river
the
day
s
short
hurry
was
nearly
over
there
was
still
a
noise
of
heavy
adzes
hewing
at
a
solid
piece
of
oak
timber
but
a
group
of
men
had
begun
to
cluster
about
a
storehouse
door
to
talk
over
the
day
s
news
the
tide
was
going
out
and
a
birch
canoe
which
the
young
mistress
had
bespoken
was
already
left
high
on
the
shore
she
gave
no
anxious
glance
for
her
boatman
but
got
into
a
stranded
skiff
and
reaching
with
a
strong
hand
caught
the
canoe
and
dragged
it
down
along
the
slippery
mud
until
she
had
it
well
afloat
then
stepping
lightly
aboard
took
up
her
carved
paddle
and
looked
before
her
to
mark
her
course
across
the
swift
current
wind
and
current
and
tide
were
all
going
seaward
together
with
a
determined
rush
there
was
a
heavy
gundalow
floating
down
the
stream
toward
the
lower
warehouse
to
be
loaded
with
potatoes
for
the
portsmouth
market
and
this
was
coming
across
the
slip
the
men
on
board
gave
a
warning
cry
as
they
caught
sight
of
a
slender
figure
in
the
fragile
craft
but
mary
only
laughed
and
with
sufficient
strength
to
court
the
emergency
struck
her
paddle
deep
into
the
water
and
shot
out
into
the
channel
right
across
their
bow
the
current
served
well
to
keep
her
out
of
reach
the
men
had
been
holding
back
their
clumsy
great
boat
lest
it
should
pass
the
wharf
one
of
them
ran
forward
anxiously
with
his
long
sweep
as
if
he
expected
to
see
the
canoe
in
distress
like
a
drowning
fly
but
miss
hamilton
without
looking
back
was
pushing
on
across
the
river
to
gain
the
eddy
on
the
farther
side
she
might
ha
held
back
a
minute
she
was
liable
to
be
catched
an
ploughed
right
under
a
gal
s
just
young
enough
to
do
that
men
that
s
met
danger
don
t
see
no
sport
in
them
tricks
grumbled
the
boatman
some
fools

tried

then

black

wrong
as

on
this
river
exclaimed
the
elder
man
indignantly
looking
back
over
his
shoulder
toward
the
long
house
of
the
wallingfords
that
stood
peaceful
in
the
autumn
sunshine
high
above
the
river
they
ve
been
good
folks
in
all
their
generations
the
lad

but
i
despise
to
see
a
low
lot
o
fools
think
smart
o
theirselves
for
bein
sassy
to
their
betters
the
other
man
looked
a
little
crestfallen
there
s
those
as
has
it
that
the
cap
n
o
the
ranger
would
n
t
let
nobody
look
at

hastened
to

em

that

with
him
in
times
past
an
they
said
he
kept
the
highest
company
in
every
port
but
if
all
tales
is
true
mostly
they
ain
t
retorted
old
philpot
scornfully
i
don
t
know
nothin
t
all
about
it
that
s
what
folks
say
answered
his
mate
he
s
got
the
look
of
a
bold
commander
anyway
and
a
voice
an
eye
that
would
wile
a
bird
from
a
bush
but
at
this
moment
the
gundalow
bumped
heavily
against
the
wharf
and
there
was
no
more
time
for
general
conversation
mary
hamilton
paddled
steadily
up
river
in
the
smooth
water
of
the
eddy
now
and
then
working
hard
to
get
round
some
rocky
point
that
bit
into
the
hurrying
stream
the
wind
was
driving
the
ebbing
tide
before
it
so
that
the
water
had
fallen
quickly
and
sometimes
the
still
dripping
boughs
of
overhanging
alders
and
oaks
swept
the
canoe
from
end
to
end
and
spattered
the
kneeling
girl
with
a
cold
shower
by
way
of
greeting
sometimes
a
musquash
splashed
into
the
water
or
scuttled
into
his
chilly
hole
under
the
bank
clattering
an
untidy
heap
of
empty
mussel
shells
as
he
went
all
the
shy
little
beasts
weasels
and
minks
and
squirrels
made
haste
to
disappear
before
this
harmless
voyager
and
came
back
again
as
she
passed
the
great
fishhawks
and
crows
sailed
high
overhead
secure
but
curious
and
harder
for
civilization
to
dispossess
of
their
rights
than
wild
creatures
that
lived
aground
the
air
was
dry
and
sweet
as
if
snow
were
coming
and
all
the
falling
leaves
were
down
here
and
there
might
linger
a
tuft
of
latest
frost
flowers
in
a
sheltered
place
and
the
in
the
thickets
was
still
sprinkled
with
bright
bloom
mary
stopped
once
under
the
shore
where
a
bough
of
this
strange
flower
grew
over
the
water
and
broke
some
twigs
to
lay
gently
before
her
in
the
canoe
the
old
indian
last
descendant
of
the
chief
passaconaway
who
had
made
the
light
craft
and
taught
her
to
guide
it
had
taught
her
many
other
things
of
his
wild
and
wise
inheritance
this
flower
of
mystery
brought
up
deep
associations
with
that
old
friend
the
child
of
savagery
and
a
shadowy
past
the
river
broadened
now
at
madam
s
cove
there
was
a
great
roaring
in
the
main
channel
beyond
where
the
river
was
vexed
by
rocky
falls
inside
the
cove
there
was
little
water
left
except
in
the
straight
channel
that
led
to
the
and
quaint
from
the
shore
a
grassy
avenue
went
winding
up
to
the
house
above
against
the
northwestern
sky
the
old
home
of
the
wallingfords
looked
sad
and
lonely
its
windows
were
like
anxious
eyes
that
followed
the
river
s
course
toward
a
dark
sea
where
its
master
had
gone
adventuring
mary
stood
on
land
looking
back
the
way
she
had
come
her
heart
was
beating
fast
but
it
was
not
from
any
effort
of
fighting
against
wind
or
tide
she
did
not
know
why
she
began
to
remember
with
strange
vividness
the
solemn
pageant
of
judge
wallingford
s
funeral
which
had
followed
the
water
highway
from
portsmouth
one
summer
evening
on
the
flood
tide
it
was
only
six
years
before
when
she
was
already
the
young
and
anxious
mistress
of
her
brother
s
house
careful
and
troubled
about
many
things
like
martha
in
spite
of
her
gentler
name
she
had
looked
out
of
an
upper
window
to
see
the
black
procession
of
boats
with
oars
come
curving
and
winding
across
the
bay
the
muffled
black
of
mourning
trailed
from
the
sides
there
were
soldiers
of
the
judge
s
regiment
sitting
straight
in
their
bright
uniforms
for
pallbearers
and
they
sounded
a
solemn
tap
of
drum
as
they
came
they
drew
nearer
the
large
coffin
with
its
tasseled
pall
the
long
train
of
boats
which
followed
filled
with
sorrowing
friends
president
of
the
province
and
many
of
the
chief
men
all
passed
slowly
by
the
tears
rushed
to
mary
s
eyes
that
day
when
she
saw
her
brother
s
serious
young
head
among
the
elder
gentlemen
and
close
beside
him
was
the
fair
face
and
blond
uncovered
hair
of
the
fatherless
son
roger
wallingford
was
but
a
boy
then
his
father
had
been
the
kind
friend
and
generous
founder
of
all
her
brother
s
fortunes
she
remembered
how
she
had
thanked
him
from
a
grateful
heart
and
meant
to
be
unsparing
in
her
service
and
unfailing
in
duty
toward
the
good
man
s
widow
and
son
they
had
read
prayers
for
him
in
the
queen
s
chapel
at
portsmouth
they
were
but
bringing
him
to
his
own
plot
of
ground
in
somersworth
at
eventide
and
mary
hamilton
prayed
for
him
out
of
a
full
heart
as
his
funeral
went
by
the
color
came
in
her
young
cheeks
at
the
remembrance
what
had
she
dared
to
do
what
responsibility
had
she
not
taken
upon
her
now
she
was
but
an
ignorant
girl
and
driven
by
the
whip
of
fate
a
strange
enthusiasm
for
which
she
could
not
in
this
dark
moment
defend
herself
had
led
her
on
it
was
like
the
moment
of
helpless
agony
that
comes
with
a
bad
dream
she
turned
again
and
faced
the
house
and
the
house
like
a
great
conscious
creature
on
the
hillside
seemed
to
wait
for
her
quietly
and
with
patience
she
was
standing
on
wallingford
s
ground
and
bent
upon
a
most
difficult
errand
there
was
neither
any
wish
for
escape
in
her
heart
nor
any
thought
of
it
and
yet
for
one
moment
she
trembled
as
if
the
wind
shook
her
as
it
shook
the
naked
trees
then
she
went
her
way
young
and
up
the
long
slope
it
was
one
of
the
strange
symbolic
correspondences
of
life
that
her
path
led
steadily
up
the
hill
the
great
door
of
the
house
opened
wide
before
her
as
if
the
whole
future
must
have
room
to
enter
old
rodney
the
chief
house
servant
stood
within
as
if
he
had
been
watching
for
succor
in
the
spacious
hall
the
portraits
looked
proud
and
serene
as
if
they
were
still
capable
of
all
hospitalities
save
that
of
speech
will
you
say
that
miss
hamilton
waits
upon
madam
wallingford
said
mary
and
the
old
man
bowed
with
much
ceremony
and
went
up
the
broad
stairway
still
nodding
and
pausing
once
with
his
hand
on
the
high
banister
to
look
back
at
so
spirited
and
beautiful
a
guest
a
faithful
heart
ached
within
him
to
see
her
look
so
young
so
so
untouched
by
sorrow
and
to
think
of
his
stricken
mistress
yet
she
had
come
into
the
chilly
house
like
a
brave
warm
reassurance
and
all
rodney
s
resentment
was
swift
to
fade
the
quick
instincts
of
his
race
were
confronted
by
something
that
had
power
to
master
them
he
comprehended
the
truth
because
it
was
a
simple
truth
and
his
was
a
simple
heart
he
disappeared
at
the
turn
of
the
staircase
into
the
upper
hall
and
mary
took
a
few
impatient
steps
to
and
fro
on
the
great
moose
antlers
was
flung
some
of
the
young
master
s
riding
gear
there
was
his
rack
of
whips
below
and
a
pair
of
leather
gloves
with
his
own
firm
grasp
still
showing
in
the
rounded
fingers
there
were
his
rods
and
guns
even
his
old
dog
leash
and
the
silver
whistle
she
knew
them
all
as
well
as
he
with
their
significance
of
past
activities
and
the
joys
of
life
and
combat
they
made
their
owner
seem
so
close
at
hand
and
the
pleasures
of
his
youth
all
snatched
away
oh
what
a
sharp
longing
for
the
old
lively
companionship
was
in
her
heart
it
was
like
knowing
that
poor
roger
was
dead
instead
of
gone
away
to
sea
he
would
come
no
more
in
the
winter
evenings
to
tell
his
hunter
s
tales
of
what
had
happened
at
the
lakes
or
to
plan
a
snowshoe
journey
up
the
country
mary
stamped
her
foot
impatiently
was
she
going
to
fall
into
helpless
weakness
now
when
she
had
most
need
to
be
quiet
and
to
keep
her
steadiness
old
rodney
was
stepping
carefully
down
the
stairs
again
she
wore
a
paler
look
than
when
they
had
parted
somehow
she
felt
like
a
stranger
in
the
familiar
house
once
rodney
would
have
been
a
mere
reflection
of
his
mistress
s
ready
welcome
but
now
he
came
close
to
miss
hamilton
s
side
and
spoke
in
an
anxious
whisper
you
ll
be
monst
ous
gentle
to
her
dis
day
young
mistis
he
asked
pleadingly
oh
yis
mistis
her
heart
s
done
broke
then
he
shuffled
away
to
the
to
move
the
tankards
on
the
great
sideboard
one
could
feel
everything
but
an
old
black
man
born
in
the
jungle
and
stolen
by
a
slaver
s
crew
knew
when
he
had
said
enough
time
of
come
sorrow
put
thy
sweet
arms
round
my
neck
for
none
are
left
to
do
this
only
thou
the
low
afternoon
sun
slanted
its
rays
into
the
stately
chamber
and
brightened
the
dull
east
indian
red
of
some
old
pictured
cottons
that
made
the
tasseled
hangings
there
were
glowing
coals
in
the
deep
fireplace
and
madam
wallingford
sat
at
the
left
in
one
of
those
great
that
seem
to
offer
refuge
to
both
illness
and
sorrow
she
had
turned
away
so
that
she
could
not
see
the
river
and
even
the
wistful
sunshine
was
all
behind
her
there
was
a
slender
with
some
white
at
her
side
but
her
hands
were
lying
idle
in
her
lap
she
had
never
been
called
beautiful
she
had
no
great
learning
though
on
a
shelf
near
by
she
had
gathered
a
little
treasury
of
good
books
she
had
manner
rather
than
manners
she
was
plainly
enough
that
unmistakable
and
easily
recognized
person
a
great
lady
they
are
but
few
in
every
generation
but
the
simplicity
and
royalty
of
their
lovely
succession
have
never
disappeared
from
an
admiring
world
come
in
mary
said
madam
wallingford
with
a
wan
look
of
gentleness
and
patience
here
i
and
sorrow
sit
she
motioned
toward
a
chair
which
her
attendant
an
ancient
countrywoman
was
placing
near
mary
crossed
the
room
quickly
and
took
her
appointed
place
then
she
clasped
her
hands
tight
together
and
her
head
drooped
at
that
moment
patriotism
and
all
its
high
resolves
may
have
seemed
too
high
she
forgot
everything
except
that
she
was
in
the
presence
of
a
lonely
woman
sad
and
old
and
bereft
she
saw
the
woeful
change
that
grief
had
made
in
this
tory
mother
of
a
patriot
son
she
could
but
sit
in
silence
with
maidenly
and
a
wistful
affectionateness
that
was
like
the
timidest
caress
young
creature
of
high
spirit
who
had
so
lately
thrown
down
her
bold
challenge
of
a
man
s
loyalty
she
sat
there
before
the
fire
afraid
of
nothing
but
her
own
insistent
tears
she
could
not
conquer
a
sudden
dumbness
that
had
forgotten
speech
she
could
not
bear
to
look
again
at
the
piteous
beloved
face
of
madam
wallingford
the
march
of
events
had
withered
the
elder
woman
and
trampled
her
underfoot
like
a
flower
in
the
road
that
every
wheel
went
over
she
had
grown
old
in
two
short
days
while
the
girl
who
sat
before
her
had
only
changed
into
brighter
bloom
you
may
leave
us
now
susan
said
madam
wallingford
and
with
many
an
anxious
glance
the
old
serving
woman
went
away
still
there
fell
silence
between
the
two
the
wind
was
droning
its
perpetual
complaining
note
in
the
chimney
a
belated
song
sparrow
lifted
its
happy
little
tune
outside
the
southern
windows
and
they
both
listened
to
the
very
end
then
their
eyes
turned
to
each
other
s
faces
the
bird
had
spoken
first
in
the
wintry
air
then
mary
hamilton
with
a
quick
cry
took
a
hurried
step
and
fell
upon
her
knees
at
the
mother
s
side
and
took
her
in
her
arms
hiding
her
own
face
from
sight
what
can
i
say
oh
what
can
i
say
she
cried
again
it
will
break
my
heart
if
you
love
me
no
more
the
elder
woman
shrank
for
a
moment
there
was
a
quick
flash
in
her
eyes
then
she
drew
mary
still
nearer
and
held
her
fast
the
comfort
of
a
warm
young
life
so
close
to
her
shivering
loneliness
the
sense
of
her
own
weakness
and
that
mary
was
the
stronger
kept
her
from
breaking
now
into
the
stern
speech
of
which
her
heart
was
full
she
said
nothing
for
a
long
time
but
sat
waiting
and
now
and
then
she
laid
her
hand
on
the
girl
s
soft
hair
until
mary
s
fit
of
weeping
had
passed
bring
the
little
footstool
here
and
sit
by
me
we
must
talk
of
many
things
together
she
gave
command
at
last
and
mary
doing
the
errand
like
a
child
lingered
by
the
window
and
then
returned
with
calmness
to
her
old
friend
s
side
the
childish
sense
of
distance
between
them
had
strangely
returned
and
yet
she
was
conscious
that
she
must
take
a
new
charge
upon
herself
and
keep
nearer
than
ever
to
this
sad
heart
i
did
not
know
his
plans
until
that
very
night
she
said
to
madam
wallingford
looking
bravely
and
sweetly
now
into
the
mother
s
face
i
could
not
understand
at
first
why
there
was
such
excitement
in
the
very
air
then
i
found
out
that
the
mob
was
ready
to
come
and
ruin
you
and
to
drag
him
out
to
answer
them
as
they
did
the
loyalists
in
boston
and
there
were
many
strangers
on
our
side
of
the
river
i
heard
a
horrid
humming
in
the
crowd
that
gathered
when
the
captain
came
they
kept
together
after
he
was
in
the
house
and
i
feared
that
they
were
bent
upon
a
worse
errand
i
was
thankful
to
know
that
roger
was
in
portsmouth
so
nothing
could
be
done
that
night
when
he
came
to
me
suddenly
a
little
later
girl
s
voice
began
to
falter
i
was
angry
with
him
at
first
i
thought
only
of
you
i
see
now
that
i
was
cruel
my
son
has
been
taught
to
honor
and
to
serve
his
king
said
madam
wallingford
coldly
he
has
put
his
country
above
his
king
now
answered
mary
hamilton
who
had
steadied
herself
and
could
go
on
yet
something
hindered
her
from
saying
more
and
the
wind
kept
up
its
steady
plaint
in
the
chimney
but
in
this
difficult
moment
the
little
bird
was
still
to
us
our
king
and
country
have
been
but
one
i
own
that
the
colonies
have
suffered
hardship
and
not
alone
through
willfulness
but
to
give
the
reins
of
government
to
unfit
men
to
put
high
matters
into
the
hands
of
rioters
and
lawbreakers
can
only
bring
ruin
i
could
not
find
it
in
my
heart
to
blame
him
even
after
the
hasty
declaration
when
he
would
not
join
with
english
troops
to
fight
the
colonies
but
to
join
the
rebels
to
fight
england
should
shame
a
house
like
this
our
government
is
held
a
high
profession
among
the
wise
of
england
these
foolish
people
will
bring
us
all
upon
the
quicksands
if
my
son
had
sailed
with
officers
and
gentlemen
such
he
has
sailed
with
a
hero
said
mary
hotly
and
in
company
with
good
men
of
our
own
neighborhood
in
whom
he
can
put
his
trust
let
us
not
quarrel
answered
the
lady
more
gently
she
leaned
her
head
against
the
chair
side
and
looked
strangely
pale
and
old
t
is
true
i
sent
for
you
to
accuse
you
and
now
you
are
here
i
only
long
for
comfort
i
am
the
mother
of
an
only
son
i
am
a
widow
you
know
what
that
can
mean
my
prop
has
gone
yet
i
would
have
sent
him
proudly
to
the
wars
like
a
mother
of
ancient
days
did
i
but
think
the
quarrel
just
i
could
but
bless
him
when
he
wakened
me
and
knelt
beside
my
bed
and
looked
so
noble
telling
his
eager
story
i
did
not
think
his
own
heart
altogether
fixed
upon
this
change
until
he
said
his
country
would
have
need
of
him
all
your
country
boy
i
begged
him
then
not
alone
this
willful
portion
of
our
heritage
can
you
forget
that
you
are
english
born
then
he
rose
up
and
stood
upon
his
feet
and
i
saw
that
i
had
looked
my
last
upon
his
boyish
days
no
dear
mother
he
told
me
i
am
beginning
to
remember
it
and
he
stooped
and
kissed
me
and
stood
between
the
curtains
looking
down
at
me
till
i
myself
could
see
his
face
no
more
i
was
so
blind
with
tears
then
he
kissed
me
yet
again
and
went
quick
away
and
i
could
hear
him
sobbing
in
the
hall
i
would
not
have
him
break
his
word
though
my
own
heart
should
break
instead
and
i
rose
then
and
put
on
my
and
i
called
to
susan
who
wept
aloud
even
chid
her
at
last
for
that
and
her
foolish
questions
and
all
through
the
dead
of
night
we
gathered
the
poor
child
s
hasty
plenishings
now
i
can
only
weep
for
things
forgotten
t
was
still
dark
when
he
rode
away
when
the
tide
turned
the
river
cried
all
along
its
banks
as
it
did
that
long
night
when
his
father
lay
dead
in
the
house
i
prayed
i
even
lingered
hoping
that
he
might
be
too
late
and
the
ship
gone
to
sea
when
he
unpacks
the
chest
he
will
not
see
the
tears
that
fell
there
i
can
not
think
of
our
parting
it
hurts
my
heart
so
he
bade
me
give
his
love
to
you
he
said
that
god
could
not
be
so
cruel
as
to
forbid
his
return
mary
hamilton
and
suddenly
as
she
spoke
all
the
plaintive
bewailing
of
her
voice
all
the
regretful
memories
were
left
behind
oh
mary
hamilton
tell
me
why
you
have
done
this
all
my
children
are
in
their
graves
save
this
one
youngest
son
since
i
was
widowed
i
have
gathered
age
even
beyond
my
years
and
a
heavy
burden
of
care
belongs
to
this
masterless
house
i
am
a
woman
full
of
fears
and
weak
in
body
my
own
forefathers
and
my
husband
s
house
alike
have
never
refused
their
loyal
service
to
church
and
state
who
can
stand
in
my
son
s
place
now
he
was
early
and
late
at
his
business
the
poor
boy
s
one
ambition
was
to
make
his
father
less
missed
by
those
who
look
to
us
for
help
what
is
a
little
soldiering
a
trading
vessel
sunk
or
an
english
town
affrighted
to
the
service
he
could
give
at
home
had
you
only
thought
of
this
had
you
only
listened
to
those
who
are
wiser
than
we
had
you
remembered
that
these
troubles
must
be
in
the
end
put
down
you
could
not
have
been
unjust
i
never
dreamed
that
the
worst
blow
that
could
fall
upon
me
except
my
dear
son
had
died
could
be
struck
me
by
your
hand
had
you
no
pity
that
you
urged
my
boy
to
go
tell
me
why
you
were
willing
tell
me
i
command
you
why
you
have
done
this
mary
was
standing
white
as
a
flower
now
before
her
dear
accuser
the
quick
scarlet
flickered
for
one
moment
in
her
cheeks
her
frightened
eyes
never
for
one
moment
left
madam
wallingford
s
face
you
must
answer
me
the
old
mother
cried
again
shaken
with
passion
and
despair
because
i
loved
you
said
the
girl
then
and
a
flash
of
light
was
on
her
face
that
matched
the
thrill
in
her
voice
god
forgive
me
i
had
no
other
reason
she
answered
as
if
she
were
a
prisoner
at
the
bar
and
her
very
life
hung
upon
the
words
madam
wallingford
had
spent
all
the
life
that
was
in
her
sleepless
nights
had
robbed
her
of
her
strength
she
was
withered
by
her
grief
into
something
like
the
very
looks
of
death
all
the
long
nights
all
the
long
hours
since
she
had
lost
her
son
she
had
said
these
things
over
to
herself
that
she
might
say
them
clear
to
those
who
ought
to
listen
they
had
now
been
said
and
her
poor
brain
that
had
shot
its
force
of
anger
and
misery
to
another
heart
was
cold
like
the
firelock
that
has
sped
its
ball
she
sank
back
into
the
chair
faint
with
weakness
she
put
out
her
hands
as
if
she
groped
for
help
oh
mary
mary
she
entreated
now
and
again
mary
forgetting
all
was
ready
with
fond
heart
to
comfort
her
it
is
of
no
use
exclaimed
madam
wallingford
rousing
herself
at
last
and
speaking
more
coldly
than
before
i
can
only
keep
to
one
thought
my
son
has
gone
t
is
love
brings
all
our
pain
this
is
what
it
means
to
have
a
child
my
joy
and
my
sorrow
are
one
and
the
light
of
my
life
casts
its
shadow
and
i
have
always
loved
you
i
have
wished
many
a
time
in
the
old
days
that
you
were
my
own
little
girl
and
now
i
am
told
that
this
adventurer
has
won
your
heart
man
who
speaks
much
of
glory
lest
glory
should
forget
to
speak
of
him
that
you
have
even
made
my
son
a
sacrifice
to
pride
and
ambition
mary
s
cheeks
flamed
her
eyes
grew
dark
and
angry
she
tried
to
speak
but
she
looked
in
her
accuser
s
face
and
first
a
natural
rage
and
then
a
sudden
pity
and
the
old
love
held
her
dumb
forgive
me
then
said
madam
wallingford
looking
at
her
and
into
her
heart
there
crept
unwonted
shame
you
do
me
wrong
you
would
wrong
both
your
son
and
me
and
mary
had
sprung
away
next
moment
from
her
side
i
have
told
only
the
truth
i
was
harsh
to
roger
when
i
had
never
known
him
false
and
i
almost
hated
him
because
he
seemed
unsettled
in
his
course
i
even
thought
that
the
rising
against
the
loyalists
had
frighted
him
and
i
hated
him
when
i
thought
he
was
seeking
shelter
he
came
that
very
night
to
tell
me
that
he
was
for
the
patriots
and
was
doing
all
a
brave
man
could
and
standing
for
liberty
with
the
rest
of
us
then
i
knew
better
than
he
how
far
the
distrust
of
him
had
gone
and
i
took
it
upon
myself
to
plead
with
the
captain
of
the
ranger
i
knew
too
well
that
if
already
prejudiced
by
envious
tales
he
turned
the
commission
down
the
mob
would
quick
take
the
signal
t
was
for
love
of
my
friends
i
acted
something
drove
me
past
myself
that
night
if
roger
should
die
if
indeed
i
have
robbed
you
of
your
son
this
was
the
part
i
took
i
would
not
have
done
otherwise
he
has
taken
a
man
s
part
for
liberty
and
i
thank
god
now
i
have
told
you
all
they
were
facing
each
other
again
mary
s
voice
was
broken
she
could
say
no
more
then
with
a
quick
change
of
look
and
with
a
splendid
gesture
madam
wallingford
rose
from
her
place
like
a
queen
her
face
shone
with
sudden
knowledge
of
new
happiness
she
held
out
her
arms
queen
and
no
accuser
but
only
a
bereft
woman
a
loving
heart
that
had
been
beggared
of
all
comfort
come
my
darling
she
whispered
you
must
forgive
me
everything
and
love
me
the
more
for
my
poor
weakness
you
will
help
me
to
have
patience
all
these
weary
months
the
sun
broke
out
again
from
behind
a
thick
cloud
and
flooded
all
the
dark
chamber
again
the
indian
stuffs
looked
warm
and
bright
the
fire
sprang
on
the
hearth
as
if
upon
an
altar
it
was
as
if
heaven
s
own
light
had
smiled
into
the
room
poor
mary
s
young
pride
was
sore
hurt
and
distressed
but
her
old
friend
s
wonted
look
of
kindness
was
strangely
coming
back
she
showed
all
her
familiar
affectionateness
as
if
she
had
passed
a
great
crisis
as
for
the
lad
whom
they
had
wept
and
quarreled
over
and
for
whose
sake
they
had
come
back
again
to
each
other
s
hearts
he
was
far
out
upon
the
gray
and
tumbling
sea
every
hour
took
him
farther
and
farther
from
home
and
now
madam
wallingford
must
talk
of
him
with
mary
and
tell
her
everything
how
he
had
chosen
but
two
books
bible
and
an
old
volume
of
french
essays
that
master
sullivan
had
given
him
when
he
went
to
college
t
was
his
copy
of
shakespeare
s
plays
said
she
that
he
wanted
most
but
in
all
our
hurry
and
with
dull
candlelight
we
could
find
it
nowhere
and
yesterday
i
saw
it
lying
here
on
my
chest
of
drawers
t
is
not
so
many
days
since
he
read
me
a
pretty
piece
of
the
tempest
as
we
sat
together
i
can
hear
his
voice
now
as
he
read
t
was
like
a
lover
the
way
he
said
noble
and
i
could
but
smile
to
hear
him
he
saw
the
great
garrick
in
his
best
characters
when
he
was
in
london
roger
was
ever
a
pretty
reader
when
he
was
a
boy
t
is
a
gift
the
dullest
child
might
learn
from
master
sullivan
the
mother
spoke
fondly
between
smiles
and
tears
the
old
book
lay
open
on
her
knee
and
something
dropped
to
the
floor
twig
of
faded
blossoms
that
her
son
had
held
in
his
fingers
as
he
read
and
left
between
the
leaves
for
a
marker
a
twig
of
perhaps
from
the
same
bough
that
mary
had
broken
as
she
came
it
were
easy
to
count
it
for
a
message
where
some
one
else
might
think
of
but
a
pretty
accident
mary
stooped
and
picked
the
withered
twig
of
blossoms
from
the
floor
and
played
with
it
smiling
as
madam
wallingford
talked
on
and
they
sat
together
late
into
the
autumn
twilight
the
poor
lady
was
like
one
who
by
force
of
habit
takes
up
the
life
of
every
day
again
when
death
has
been
in
the
house
the
familiar
presence
of
her
young
neighbor
had
cured
her
for
the
moment
of
the
pain
of
loneliness
but
the
sharp
words
she
had
spoken
in
her
distress
would
ache
for
many
a
day
in
mary
s
heart
mary
could
not
understand
that
strange
moment
when
she
had
been
forgiven
yet
the
hardest
soul
might
have
compassion
for
a
poor
woman
so
overwrought
and
defeated
she
was
still
staggering
from
a
heavy
blow
it
was
dark
when
they
parted
and
madam
wallingford
showed
a
strange
solicitude
after
her
earlier
reproaches
and
forbade
mary
when
she
would
have
crossed
the
river
alone
she
took
a
new
air
of
rightful
command
and
rodney
must
send
two
of
the
men
with
their
own
boat
and
put
by
the
canoe
until
morning
the
stars
were
bright
and
quick
as
diamonds
overhead
and
it
was
light
enough
on
the
water
as
they
crossed
the
candlelight
in
the
upper
chamber
on
the
hill
looked
dim
as
if
there
were
illness
in
the
house
indeed
madam
wallingford
was
trembling
with
cold
since
her
young
guest
had
gone
susan
wrapped
her
in
an
old
cloak
of
soft
fur
as
she
sat
beside
the
fire
and
turned
often
to
look
at
her
anxiously
as
she
piled
the
fagots
and
logs
on
the
hearth
until
their
flame
towered
high
dear
child
dear
child
the
poor
lady
said
over
and
over
in
her
heart
i
think
she
does
not
know
it
yet
but
i
believe
she
loves
my
son
that
night
old
susan
hovered
about
her
mistress
altering
the
droop
of
the
bed
curtains
and
untwisting
the
balls
of
their
fringe
with
a
businesslike
air
then
she
put
some
heavy
knots
of
wood
on
the
fire
for
the
night
and
built
it
solidly
together
until
the
leaping
lights
and
shadows
played
fast
about
the
room
she
glanced
as
often
as
she
dared
at
the
tired
face
on
the
pillow
t
is
a
wild
night
susan
said
madam
wallingford
i
thought
the
wind
was
going
down
with
the
sun
how
often
i
have
watched
for
my
dear
man
such
nights
as
this
when
he
was
kept
late
in
portsmouth
t
was
well
we
lived
in
town
those
latest
winters
you
remember
that
rodney
always
kept
the
fire
bright
in
the
dining
parlor
t
is
a
cosy
place
in
winter
and
put
a
tankard
of
mulled
wine
inside
the
fender
t
would
bring
back
the
color
to
his
face
all
chilled
with
winter
rain
and
the
light
into
his
eyes
and
roger
would
come
in
with
him
holding
his
father
s
hand
he
would
ever
run
out
bareheaded
in
the
wet
while
i
called
to
them
from
the
door
to
come
in
and
let
the
horse
go
to
stable
and
they
laughed
at
me
for
my
fears
where
is
roger
i
wonder
susan
they
can
not
be
in
port
for
a
long
time
yet
i
hate
to
think
of
him
on
the
sea
maybe
t
is
morning
there
and
the
sun
out
madam
susan
said
madam
wallingford
you
used
to
sing
to
him
when
he
was
a
baby
sit
near
the
fire
awhile
is
no
more
for
you
to
do
sing
one
of
your
old
hymns
so
that
i
may
go
to
sleep
perhaps
it
will
quiet
his
heart
too
if
we
are
quiet
and
try
to
be
at
peace
the
very
shadows
grew
stiller
as
if
to
listen
as
the
patient
old
handmaiden
came
and
sat
beside
the
bed
and
began
to
sing
moving
her
foot
as
if
she
still
held
the
restless
baby
who
had
grown
to
be
a
man
there
were
quavering
notes
in
her
voice
but
when
she
had
sung
all
her
pious
verses
of
the
cradle
hymn
to
their
very
end
madam
wallingford
was
fast
asleep
but
when
shall
i
see
athens
and
the
acropolis
again
wretched
man
doth
not
that
satisfy
thee
which
thou
seest
every
day
hast
thou
aught
better
or
greater
to
see
than
the
sun
the
moon
the
stars
the
common
earth
the
sea
who
would
hercules
have
been
if
he
had
sat
at
home
the
ranger
was
under
full
sail
and
ran
like
a
hound
she
had
cleared
the
banks
with
all
their
snow
squalls
and
thick
nights
without
let
or
hindrance
the
captain
s
boast
that
he
would
land
his
dispatches
and
spread
the
news
of
burgoyne
s
surrender
in
france
in
thirty
days
seemed
likely
to
come
true
the
men
were
already
beginning
to
show
effects
of
constant
vigilance
and
overwork
but
whatever
discomforts
might
arrive
the
splendid
seamanship
of
paul
jones
could
only
be
admired
by
such
sailors
as
made
up
the
greater
portion
of
his
crew
the
younger
members
of
the
ship
s
company
were
full
of
gayety
if
the
wind
and
work
eased
ever
so
little
and
at
any
time
by
night
or
day
some
hearty
voice
might
be
heard
practicing
the
strains
of
a
stirring
song
new
made
by
one
of
the
midshipmen
that
is
why
we
brave
the
blast
to
carry
the
news
to
there
were
plenty
of
rival
factions
and
jealousies
the
river
men
were
against
all
strangers
and
even
the
river
men
had
their
own
divisions
their
warm
friendships
and
cold
aversions
so
that
now
and
then
some
smouldering
fire
came
perilously
near
an
outbreak
the
tremendous
pressure
of
work
alow
and
aloft
the
driving
wind
the
heavy
tumbling
seas
the
constant
exposure
and
strain
in
such
trying
duty
and
incessant
service
of
the
sails
put
upon
every
man
all
that
he
could
well
bear
and
sent
him
to
his
berth
as
tired
as
a
dog
it
takes
but
little
while
for
a
good
shipmaster
to
discover
who
are
the
difficult
men
in
his
crew
the
sea
lawyers
and
breeders
of
dissatisfaction
the
captain
of
the
ranger
was
a
man
of
astonishing
readiness
both
to
blame
and
praise
nobody
could
resist
his
inspiriting
enthusiasm
and
dominating
presence
but
in
absence
he
was
often
proved
wrong
and
roundly
cursed
as
captains
are
with
solid
satisfaction
of
resentment
everybody
cheered
when
he
boldly
declared
against
flogging
and
even
tossed
that
horrid
implement
the
cat
lightly
over
the
ship
s
side
even
in
this
surprising
moment
one
of
the
old
seamen
had
growled
that
when
you
saw
a
man
too
good
it
was
the
time
to
look
out
for
him
i
dasen
t
say
but
it
s
about
time
to
get
a
fuss
going
said
one
of
these
mariners
to
a
friend
later
on
ginerally
takes
about
ten
days
to
start
a
row
atween
decks
less
you
re
extra
eased
off
with
good
weather
illustration
the
ranger
this
bad
weather
s
all
along
o
dickson
ventured
his
comrade
if
they
d
known
what
they
was
about
he
d
been
the
fust
man
they
d
hasted
to
set
ashore
i
know
him
i
ve
knowed
him
ever
since
he
was
a
boy
i
see
him
get
a
black
stripe
o
rage
acrost
his
face
when
he
seen
wallin
ford
come
aboard
that
mornin
wallin
ford
s
folks
cotched
him
thievin
when
he
had
his
fat
chance
o
surveyor
up
country
after
the
old
judge
died
he
cut
their
growth
on
his
own
account
and
done
a
sight
o
tricks
and
madam
dismissed
him
and
would
ha
jailed
him
but
for
pity
of
his
folks
i
always
wished
she
d
done
it
t
would
ha
stamped
him
plain
if
he
d
seen
the
inside
o
old
york
jail
for
a
couple
o
years
as
t
was
he
had
his
own
story
to
tell
and
made
out
how
he
was
the
injured
one
so
there
was
some
o
them
fools
that
likes
to
be
on
the
off
side
that
went
an
upheld
him
oh
dickson
s
smart
and
some
calls
him
pious
but
i
wish
you
d
seen
him
the
day
madam
wallin
ford
sent
for
him
to
speak
her
mind
that
mornin
we
was
sailin
out
o
porchmouth
i
see
him
watch
the
young
man
as
if
he
was
layin
for
him
like
a
tiger
there
he
is
now
comin
out
o
the
cabin
i
guess
the
cap
n
s
been
rakin
him
fore
an
aft
he
hates
him
an
simpson
hates
him
too
but
not
so
bad
simpson
don
t
jibe
with
the
cap
n
hisself
so
he
demeans
himself
to
hark
to
dickson
more
n
he
otherwise
would
lord
what
a
cur
ous
world
this
is
what
s
that
n
ise
risin
out
o
the
fo
c
s
le
now
cooper
le
s
go
see
and
the
two
old
comrades
made
haste
to
go
below
paul
jones
gave
a
hearty
sigh
as
he
sat
alone
in
his
cabin
and
struck
his
fist
into
the
empty
air
he
also
could
hear
the
sound
of
a
loud
quarrel
from
the
gun
deck
and
for
a
moment
indulged
a
fierce
hope
that
somebody
might
be
well
punished
or
even
killed
just
to
lessen
the
number
of
citizens
in
this
wrangling
village
with
which
he
had
put
to
sea
they
had
brought
aboard
all
the
unsettled
rivalries
and
jealousies
of
a
most
independent
neighborhood
he
looked
about
him
as
he
sat
then
rose
and
impatiently
closed
one
of
his
lockers
where
there
was
an
untidy
fold
of
crumpled
clothing
hanging
out
what
miserable
surroundings
and
conditions
for
a
man
of
inborn
fastidiousness
and
refinement
of
nature
yet
this
new
ship
so
fast
growing
toward
the
disgusting
squalor
of
an
old
one
these
men
with
their
cheap
suspicions
and
narrow
ambitions
were
the
strong
tools
ready
to
his
hand
it
was
a
manly
crew
as
crews
go
and
in
respect
to
their
country
s
wrongs
i
feel
it
in
my
breast
that
i
shall
some
day
be
master
in
a
great
sea
fight
said
the
little
captain
as
he
sat
alone
while
the
ranger
labored
against
the
waves
and
the
light
of
heroic
endurance
came
back
to
his
eyes
as
he
saw
again
the
splendid
vision
that
had
ever
led
him
on
curse
that
scoundrel
dickson
and
his
look
darkened
patience
patience
if
i
were
a
better
sleeper
i
could
face
everything
that
can
come
in
a
man
s
day
i
could
face
the
devil
himself
the
wind
s
in
the
right
quarter
now
and
the
sea
s
going
down
i
ll
go
on
deck
and
give
all
hands
some
grog
ll
give
it
them
myself
the
poor
fellows
are
cold
and
wet
and
they
serve
me
like
men
we
re
getting
past
the
worst
and
again
paul
jones
fell
to
studying
his
charts
as
if
they
were
love
letters
writ
by
his
lady
s
hand
cooper
and
hanscom
had
come
below
to
join
the
rest
of
their
watch
and
still
sat
side
by
side
being
old
shipmates
and
friends
there
was
an
easy
sort
of
comfort
in
being
together
just
now
they
spoke
again
in
low
voices
of
young
wallingford
young
master
looks
to
me
said
hanscom
don
t
fancy
privateerin
so
well
as
ridin
a
blood
horse
on
porchmouth
parade
and
bein
courted
by
the
tory
looks
wintry
in
the
face
to
me
lord
bless
us
when
he
s
old
s
we
are
he
ll
l
arn
that
spring
al
ays
gets
round
again
long
s
a
creatur
s
alive
answered
cooper
who
instinctively
gave
a
general
turn
to
the
discussion
ary
thing
that
s
livin
knows
its
four
seasons
an
i
ve
long
maintained
that
after
the
wust
o
winter
spring
usu
lly
doos
come
follerin
right
on
i
don
t
know
but
it
s
so
agreed
his
mate
politely
cooper
would
have
these
fanciful
notions
while
hanscom
was
a
man
what
i
d
like
to
know
said
he
yes
what
i
d
like
to
ascertain
is
what
young
squire
wallin
ford
ever
come
for
t
ain
t
in
his
blood
to
fight
on
our
side
an
he
s
too
to
play
the
sneak
also
he
never
come
from
cowardice
no
i
can
t
make
it
out
noway
sometimes
folks
mistakes
their
duty
and
risks
their
all
bain
t
spyin
round
to
do
no
hurt
is
he
he
there
was
a
sharp
suggestion
in
the
way
this
question
was
put
and
cooper
turned
fiercely
upon
his
companion
hunscom
i
be
ashamed
of
you
he
said
scornfully
and
said
no
more
there
was
a
dull
warmth
of
color
in
his
hard
face
he
was
an
elderly
quiet
man
with
a
round
pleasant
countenance
unaltered
in
the
worst
of
weather
and
a
look
of
kindly
tolerance
there
s
b
en
some
consid
able
changin
o
sides
in
our
neighborhood
as
you
know
he
said
a
few
moments
later
in
his
usual
tone
young
wallin
ford
went
to
school
to
master
sullivan
and
the
old
master
l
arnt
everybody
he
could
l
arn
to
be
honest
an
square
to
hold
by
their
word
an
be
afeard
o
nothin
pity
t
was
that
dickson
could
n
t
ha
got
a
term
o
such
schoolin
said
hanscom
as
they
beheld
that
shipmate
s
unwelcome
face
peering
down
the
companion
sometimes
i
wish
i
was
to
home
again
announced
cooper
in
an
unexpected
fit
of
despondency
i
don
know
why
tain
t
usual
with
me
to
have
such
feelin
s
in
the
outset
of
a
v
y
ge
i
grow
sicker
every
day
o
this
flat
strivin
sea
i
was
raised
on
a
good
hill
i
don
know
how
i
ever
come
to
foller
the
sea
anyway
the
forecastle
was
a
forlorn
at
best
and
crowded
at
any
hour
almost
past
endurance
the
one
hint
of
homeliness
and
decency
was
in
the
sea
chests
which
had
not
been
out
of
place
against
a
steadier
wall
in
the
farmhouses
whence
most
of
them
had
come
they
were
of
plain
wood
with
a
touch
of
art
in
their
rude
carving
many
of
them
were
painted
dull
green
or
blue
there
were
others
with
really
handsome
escutcheons
of
wrought
iron
and
all
were
graced
with
fine
turk
to
their
rope
handles
and
every
ingenuity
of
sailors
fancywork
there
was
a
grumbling
company
of
able
seamen
their
owners
who
had
no
better
place
to
sit
than
the
chest
tops
or
to
stretch
at
idle
length
with
these
treasuries
to
lean
against
the
cold
sea
was
nearer
to
a
man
than
when
he
was
on
deck
and
could
reassure
himself
of
freedom
by
a
look
at
the
sky
the
hammocks
were
here
and
there
sagging
with
the
rounded
bulk
of
a
sleeping
owner
and
all
jerked
uneasily
as
the
vessel
pitched
and
rolled
by
turns
the
air
was
close
and
heavy
with
dampness
and
tobacco
smoke
at
this
moment
the
great
sea
boots
of
simon
staples
were
seen
descending
from
the
deck
above
and
stumbling
dangerously
on
the
slippery
straight
ladder
handsomely
handsomely
urged
a
spectator
with
deep
solicitude
she

he
repeated
cheerfully
at
last
getting
his
head
down
under
decks
as
his
foot
found
the
last
step
she
s
been
on
a
good
leadin

tis

this
v
y
ge
there
was
a
loud
groan
from
the
listeners
the
captain
insisted
upon
spreading
every
rag
the
ship
could
stagger
under
and
while
they
admired
his
persistent
daring
it
was
sometimes
too
much
for
flesh
and
blood
staples
was
looking
ruefully
at
his
yarn
mittens
they
were
far
beyond
the
possibility
of
repair
and
he
took
off
first
one
and
then
the
other
of
these
cherished
reminders
of
much
logging
experience
and
sitting
on
his
sea
chest
began
to
ravel
what
broken
gray
yarn
was
left
and
to
wind
it
into
a

william
young
a

man
with
a
responsible
look
was
waiting
with
some
impatience
for
chase
to
stand
out
of
the
poor
supply
of
light
that
came
down
the
narrow
hatchway
young
was
reading
an

copy
of

that
had
already
been
the

of

aboard
what

inquired
with

goin

can

dull
as

hanscom
and
cooper
looked
up
eagerly
some
of
the
other
men
only
laughed
for
answer
but
chase
signified
that
the
trouble
lay
with
their
messmate
starbuck
who
appeared
to
be
surly
and
sat
with
his
back
to
the
company
he
now
turned
and
displayed
a
countenance
but
said
nothing
what

hastened
to

up

chase
the
nantucket
sailor
looked
at
him
with
a
laugh
what
a
farmer
you
be
he
exclaimed
makes
me
think
of
a
countryman
shipmate
o
mine
on
the
brig
polly
dunn
we
was
whaling
in
the
south
seas
an
it
come
on
to
blow
like
fury
we
was
rollin
rails
under
an
i
was
well
skeert
myself
feared
i
could
n
t
keep
my
holt
him
an
me
was
on
the
fore
yard
together
he
looked
dreadful
easy
an
pleasant
i
thought
he
d
be
skeert
too
if
he
knowed
enough
an
i
kind
o
swore
at
the
fool
an
axed
him
what
he
was
of
why
t
is
the
o
may
says
he
all
the
caows
goes
to
pastur
to
home
in
eppin
there
was
a
cheerful
chuckle
from
the
audience
grant
alone
looked
much
perplexed
why
t
is
the
day
ain
t
it
he
protested
what
be
you
all
at
at
this
moment
there
was
a
strange
lull
the
wind
fell
and
the
ranger
stopped
rolling
and
then
staggered
as
if
she
balked
at
some
unexpected
danger
one
of
the
elder
seamen
gave
an
odd
warning
cry
a
monstrous
hammer
seemed
to
strike
the
side
and
a
great
wave
swept
over
as
if
to
bury
them
forever
in
the
sea
the
water
came
pouring
down
and
flooded
the
forecastle
there
was
an
outcry
on
deck
and
an
instant
later
three
loud
knocks
on
the
scuttle
all
the
larboard
watch
ahoy
bawled
john
dougall
hear
the
news
can
t
ye
all
hands
up
all
hands
on
deck
mind
of
the
or
rather
no
arte
but
a
divine
and
heavenly
instinct
not
to
be
gotten
by
labour
and
learning
but
adorned
by
both
there
was
one
man
at
least
on
board
the
ranger
who
was
a
lover
of
peace
this
was
the
ship
s
surgeon
ezra
green
with
a
strong
and
hearty
crew
and
the
voyage
just
beginning
his
professional
duties
had
naturally
been
but
light
he
had
no
more
concern
with
the
working
of
the
ship
than
if
he
were
sitting
in
his
office
at
home
in
dover
and
eagerly
assented
to
the
captain
s
proposal
that
he
should
act
as
the
ranger
s
purser
the
surgeon
s
tiny
cabin
was
stuffed
with
books
this
was
a
good
chance
to
go
on
with
his
studies
and
being
a
good
sailor
and
a
cheerful
man
the
whole
ship
s
company
took
pleasure
in
his
presence
there
was
an
amiable
seriousness
about
his
demeanor
that
calmed
even
the
activities
of
the
captain
s
temper
he
seemed
to
be
surgeon
and
purser
and
chaplain
all
in
one
and
to
be
fit
as
one
of
his
calling
should
be
to
minister
to
both
souls
and
bodies
it
was
known
on
board
that
he
was
unusually
liberal
in
his
views
of
religion
and
was
provided
with
some
works
upon
theology
as
well
as
medicine
and
could
argue
well
for
the
arminian
doctrines
against
dickson
who
like
many
men
of
his
type
was
pretentious
of
great
religious
zeal
and
declared
himself
a
calvinist
of
the
severest
order
dickson
was
pleased
to
consider
the
surgeon
very
lax
and
heretical
as
if
that
would
make
the
world
think
himself
a
good
man
and
the
surgeon
a
bad
one
which
was
for
evident
proof
and
reason
quite
impossible
on
this
dark
night
after
the
terrible
sea
of
the
afternoon
had
gone
down
and
poor
solomon
hutchings
the
first
victim
of
the
voyage
had
been
made
as
comfortable
as
possible
under
the
circumstances
of
a
badly
broken
leg
the
surgeon
was
sitting
alone
with
a
pleasant
sense
of
having
been
useful
he
gave
a
sigh
at
the
sound
of
dickson
s
voice
outside
dickson
would
be
ready
as
usual
for
an
altercation
and
was
one
of
those
men
who
always
come
into
a
room
as
if
they
expect
to
be
kicked
out
of
it
green
was
writing
kept
a
careful
journal
of
the
voyage
now
looked
over
his
shoulder
impatiently
as
if
he
did
not
wish
to
be
interrupted
dickson
wore
a
look
of
patient
persistence
the
surgeon
pointed
to
a
seat
with
his
long
quill
and
finished
the
writing
of
a
sentence
he
could
not
honestly
welcome
a
man
whom
he
liked
so
little
and
usually
treated
him
as
if
he
were
a
patient
who
had
come
to
seek
advice
i
only
dropped
in
for
a
chat
explained
the
visitor
reprovingly
as
his
host
looked
up
again
have
you
heard
how
the
captain
blew
at
young
wallingford
just
before
dark
well
sir
they
are
at
supper
together
now
wallingford
must
be
a
tame
kitten
i
suppose
he
crept
down
to
the
table
as
if
he
wanted
to
be
stroked
he
is
a
good
fellow
and
a
gentleman
said
ezra
green
slowly
the
captain
has
hardly
left
the
deck
since
yesterday
noon
when
this
gale
began
the
surgeon
was
a
young
man
but
he
had
a
grave
manner
which
dickson
s
sneering
smoothness
seemed
always
to
insult
you
always
take
jones
s
part
ventured
the
guest
we
are
not
living
in
a
tavern
ashore
retorted
the
surgeon
the
officer
you
speak
of
is
our
captain
and
commands
an
american
that
must
be
understood
i
can
not
discuss
these
matters
again
some
of
the
best
sailors
vow
they
will
desert
him
in
the
first
french
port
said
dickson
then
they
make
themselves
liable
to
be
shot
for
desertion
whenever
they
are
caught
replied
green
coolly
and
you
must
take
every
opportunity
to
tell
them
so
those
who
are
here
simply
to
make
a
little
dirty
money
had
better
have
stayed
ashore
and
traded
their
country
produce
with
the
british
ships
they
say
there
was
a
business
on
foot
out
at
the
isles
of
shoals
this
advice
struck
home
as
the
speaker
desired
dickson
swallowed
hard
once
or
twice
and
then
looked
meek
and
stubborn
he
watched
the
surgeon
slyly
before
he
spoke
again
yes
it
is
a
very
difficult
crew
to
command
he
agreed
we
have
plenty
of
good
loyal
men
aboard
but
they
want
revenge
for
their
country
s
wrongs
as
you
and
i
do
i
hope
war
is
one
thing
and
has
law
and
order
to
dignify
it
common
piracy
and
thievery
are
of
another
breed
some
of
our
men
need
education
in
these
matters
not
to
say
all
the
discipline
they
can
get
the
captain
is
much
wronged
and
insulted
by
the
spirit
that
has
begun
to
spread
between
decks
i
believe
that
he
has
the
right
view
of
his
duty
his
methods
are
sometimes
his
own
as
in
the
case
of
wallingford
blandly
suggested
dickson
swift
to
seize
his
opportunity
even
you
would
have
thought
the
captain
outrageous
in
his
choice
of
words
the
captain
is
a
man
easily
provoked
and
has
suffered
certain
provocations
such
as
no
man
of
spirit
could
brook
i
believe
he
was
very
wrong
to
vent
his
spite
on
wallingford
who
has
proved
as
respectful
of
others
and
forgetful
of
himself
as
any
man
on
board
i
say
this
without
knowing
the
present
circumstances
but
wallingford
has
made
a
nobler
sacrifice
than
any
of
us
he
would
have
been
chased
to
his
own
kind
among
the
tories
in
another
week
sneered
the
other
you
know
it
as
well
as
wallingford
hesitated
just
as
long
as
he
dared
and
there
s
the
truth
he
s
a
good
mate
to
ben
thompson
of
em
courtiers
of
the
wentworths
and
both
of
em
had
to
hurry
at
the
last
one
way
or
the
other
whichever
served
plenty
of
our
best
citizens
clung
to
the
hope
that
delay
would
bring
some
proper
arbitration
and
concession
no
good
citizen
went
to
war
lightly
and
without
a
pang
a
man
who
has
seen
carnage
must
always
dread
it
such
glory
as
we
win
must
reckon
upon
groans
and
weeping
behind
the
loudest
cheers
but
war
once
declared
men
of
clear
conscience
and
decent
character
may
accept
their
lot
and
in
the
end
serve
their
country
best
said
the
doctor
you
are
sentimental
scoffed
dickson
i
have
been
thinking
much
of
home
said
the
surgeon
with
deep
feeling
i
may
never
see
my
home
again
nor
may
you
we
are
near
shore
now
in
a
few
days
this
ship
may
be
smeared
with
blood
and
these
poor
fellows
who
snarl
and
bargain
and
discuss
the
captain
s
orders
and
the
chance
of
prize
money
may
come
under
my
hands
bleeding
and
torn
and
suffering
their
last
agony
we
must
face
these
things
as
best
we
may
we
do
not
know
what
war
means
yet
the
captain
will
spare
none
of
us
he
is
like
a
creature
in
a
cage
now
fretted
by
his
bounds
and
all
their
petty
conditions
but
when
the
moment
of
freedom
comes
he
will
seek
action
he
is
fit
by
nature
to
leap
to
the
greatest
opportunities
and
to
do
what
the
best
of
us
could
never
dream
of
no
not
you
sir
nor
simpson
either
though
he
aims
to
supplant
him
grumbled
the
surgeon
under
his
voice
perhaps
his
gift
is
too
great
for
so
small
a
command
as
this
dickson
returned
with
an
evil
smile
it
is
understood
that
he
must
be
transferred
to
a
more
sufficient
frigate
if
france
sees
fit
he
added
in
a
pious
tone
i
shall
strive
to
do
my
own
duty
in
either
case
at
which
green
looked
up
and
smiled
dickson
laughed
back
he
was
quick
to
feel
the
change
of
mood
in
his
companion
for
a
moment
they
were
like
two
schoolboys
but
there
was
a
flicker
of
malice
in
dickson
s
eyes
no
one
likes
being
laughed
at
shall
we
take
a
hand
at
cards
sir
he
asked
hastily
all
these
great
things
will
soon
be
settled
when
we
get
to
france
the
surgeon
did
not
offer
to
get
the
cards
which
lay
on
the
nearest
shelf
he
was
clasping
his
hands
across
his
broad
breast
and
leaning
back
in
a
comfortable
tolerant
sort
of
way
in
his
corner
seat
they
both
knew
perfectly
well
that
they
were
in
for
a
long
evening
together
and
might
as
well
make
the
best
of
it
it
was
too
much
trouble
to
fight
with
a
cur
somehow
the
current
of
general
interest
did
not
set
as
usual
toward
theological
opinions
i
was
called
to
a
patient
down
on
sligo
point
beyond
the
gulf
road
just
before
we
sailed
said
green
presently
in
a
more
friendly
tone
t
was
an
old
woman
of
unsteady
brain
but
of
no
fancy
who
was
under
one
of
her
wildest
spells
and
had
mounted
the
house
roof
to
sell
all
her
neighbors
at
auction
she
was
amusing
enough
t
is
a
pretty
wit
when
she
is
sane
but
i
heard
roars
of
laughter
as
i
rode
up
the
lane
and
saw
a
flock
of
listeners
at
the
orchard
edge
she
had
knocked
off
the
minister
and
both
deacons
the
lot
for
ninepence
and
was
running
her
lame
neighbor
paul
to
seventy
thousand
pounds
i
heard
that
they
called
the
minister
to
pray
with
her
when
her
fit
was
coming
on
and
she
chased
him
down
the
lane
and
would
have
driven
him
into
the
river
if
there
had
not
been
some
men
at
fall
ploughing
in
a
field
near
by
she
was
a
fixed
calvinist
in
her
prime
and
always
thought
him
lax
said
dickson
with
relish
continuing
the
tale
they
had
told
the
good
man
to
come
dressed
in
his
gown
and
bands
thinking
it
would
impress
her
mind
which
it
certainly
seemed
to
do
agreed
the
doctor
at
any
rate
she
knocked
him
down
for
t
was
a
good
sample
of
the
valuation
most
of
us
put
upon
our
neighbors
she
likes
to
hear
her
neighbor
paul
play
the
fiddle
sometimes
he
can
make
her
forget
all
her
poor
distresses
and
fall
asleep
like
a
baby
the
minister
had
somehow
vexed
her
our
standards
are
just
as
personal
here
aboard
ship
the
great
day
will
sum
up
men
at
their
true
value
shall
never
do
it
before
t
would
ask
too
much
of
poor
human
nature
dickson
drummed
on
the
bulkhead
before
he
spoke
some
men
are
taken
at
less
than
their
true
value
and
some
at
more
especially
by
themselves
don
t
let
things
go
too
far
with
simpson
he
s
a
good
man
but
can
easily
be
led
into
making
trouble
said
the
surgeon
and
dickson
half
rose
and
then
sat
down
again
with
his
face
showing
an
angry
red
we
must
be
patient
added
the
surgeon
a
moment
later
without
having
looked
again
at
his
companion
t
is
just
like
a
cage
of
beasts
here
fierce
and
harmless
are
shut
in
together
tame
creatures
are
sometimes
forced
to
show
their
teeth
we
must
not
fret
about
petty
things
either
t
is
a
great
errand
we
have
come
out
upon
and
the
honest
doing
of
it
is
all
the
business
we
have
in
common
true
sir
said
dickson
with
a
touch
of
insolent
flattery
shall
we
take
a
hand
at
cards
add
more
o
garlands
hanging
by
these
doors
now
stay
nor
from
your
leaves
too
quickly
shake
away
my
dew
of
tears
how
many
such
ah
me
a
lover
s
eyes
must
shed
captain
paul
jones
was
waiting
a
most
affable
and
dignified
host
to
greet
his
guest
wallingford
stood
before
him
with
a
faint
flush
of
anger
brightening
his
cheeks
you
commanded
me
sir
he
said
shortly
oh
come
wallingford
exclaimed
the
captain
never
so
friendly
before
and
keeping
that
pleasant
voice
and
manner
which
at
once
claimed
comradeship
from
men
and
admiring
affection
from
women
i
ll
drop
the
commander
when
we
re
by
ourselves
if
you
ll
consent
and
we
ll
say
what
we
like
i
wanted
you
to
sup
with
me
i
ve
got
a
bottle
of
good
wine
for
us
of
hamilton
s
madeira
wallingford
hesitated
after
all
what
did
it
matter
the
captain
was
the
captain
there
was
a
vigorous
sort
of
refreshment
in
this
life
on
shipboard
a
man
could
not
judge
his
associates
by
the
one
final
test
of
their
being
gentlemen
but
only
expect
of
each
that
he
should
follow
after
his
kind
outside
society
there
lies
humanity
the
lieutenant
seated
himself
under
the
swinging
lamp
and
took
the
glass
that
was
held
out
to
him
they
drank
together
to
the
flag
they
carried
and
to
their
lucky
landfall
on
the
morrow
to
france
said
the
captain
gallantly
it
was
plainly
expected
that
all
personal
misunderstandings
should
be
drowned
in
the
good
wine
wallingford
knew
the
flavor
well
enough
and
even
from
which
cask
in
hamilton
s
cellar
it
had
been
drawn
then
the
captain
was
quickly
on
his
feet
again
and
took
the
four
steps
to
and
fro
which
were
all
his
cabin
permitted
he
did
not
even
appear
to
be
impatient
though
supper
was
slow
in
coming
his
hands
were
clasped
behind
him
and
he
smiled
once
or
twice
but
did
not
speak
and
seemed
to
be
lost
in
thought
as
for
the
guest
his
thoughts
were
with
mary
hamilton
the
flavor
of
wine
like
the
fragrance
of
a
flower
can
be
a
quick
spur
to
memory
he
saw
her
bright
face
and
sweet
expectant
eyes
as
if
they
were
sitting
together
at
hamilton
s
own
table
the
process
of
this
evening
meal
at
sea
was
not
a
long
one
and
when
the
two
men
had
dispatched
their
food
with
businesslike
haste
the
steward
was
dismissed
and
they
were
left
alone
with
hamilton
s
madeira
at
better
than
half
tide
in
the
bottle
between
them
a
plate
of
biscuit
and
some
raisins
and
the
usual
pack
of
cards
paul
jones
covered
these
with
a
forbidding
hand
and
presently
pushed
them
aside
altogether
and
added
a
handful
of
pipes
to
the
provisioning
of
the
plain
dessert
he
wished
to
speak
of
serious
things
and
could
not
make
too
long
an
evening
away
from
his
papers
it
seemed
incredible
that
the
voyage
was
so
near
its
end
he
refilled
his
own
glass
and
wallingford
s
i
foresee
much
annoyance
now
on
board
this
ship
i
must
at
once
post
to
paris
and
here
they
will
have
time
to
finish
their
machinations
at
their
leisure
without
me
to
drive
them
up
to
duty
have
you
long
known
this
man
dickson
asked
the
captain
lowering
his
voice
and
fixing
his
eyes
upon
the
lieutenant
i
have
always
known
him
he
was
once
in
our
own
employ
and
much
trusted
but
was
afterward
dismissed
and
for
the
worst
of
reasons
said
wallingford
what
reputation
has
he
borne
in
the
neighborhood
he
is
called
a
sharp
man
of
business
quick
to
see
his
own
advantage
and
generous
in
buying
the
good
will
of
those
who
can
serve
his
purpose
he
is
a
stirring
fellow
very
but
he
has
been
unlucky
in
his
larger
ventures
as
if
fortune
did
not
much
incline
to
favor
him
i
despised
the
fellow
from
the
first
said
the
captain
with
engaging
frankness
but
i
have
no
fear
that
i
can
not
master
him
he
is
much
cleverer
than
many
a
better
man
yet
t
is
not
well
to
forget
that
a
cripple
in
the
right
road
can
beat
a
racer
in
the
wrong
he
has
been
sure
these
last
days
that
he
possesses
my
confidence
but
i
have
made
him
serve
some
good
turns
now
he
is
making
trouble
as
fast
as
he
can
between
simpson
and
me
simpson
knows
little
of
human
nature
he
would
as
soon
have
dickson
s
praise
as
yours
or
mine
he
can
not
wait
to
supplant
me
in
this
command
and
he
frets
to
gather
prizes
off
these
rich
seas
there
s
no
harm
in
prizes
but
i
sometimes
think
that
no
soul
on
board
has
any
real
comprehension
of
the
larger
duties
of
our
voyage
and
the
ends
it
may
serve
in
furthering
an
alliance
with
france
they
all
begin
well
instructed
by
dickson
to
look
upon
me
as
hardly
more
than
a
passenger
t
is
true
that
i
look
for
a
french
frigate
very
soon
as
dickson
tells
them
but
he
adds
that
it
is
to
simpson
they
must
look
for
success
while
if
he
could
rid
himself
of
simpson
he
would
do
it
i
must
have
a
fleet
if
i
can
and
as
soon
as
i
can
and
be
master
of
it
too
i
have
my
plans
all
well
laid
dickson
is
full
of
plots
of
his
own
but
to
tell
such
a
man
the
truth
about
himself
is
to
give
him
the
blackest
of
insults
wallingford
made
a
gesture
of
impatience
the
captain
s
face
relaxed
and
he
laughed
as
he
leaned
across
the
table
dickson
took
his
commission
for
the
sake
of
prize
money
he
said
a
pirate
a
pirate
that
s
what
he
is
but
oh
how
pious
in
his
speech
unpitying
hears
the
captive
s
moans
or
e
en
a
dying
brother
s
groans
there
s
a
hymn
for
him
exclaimed
the
captain
with
bitter
emphasis
no
he
has
no
gleam
of
true
patriotism
in
his
cold
heart
he
is
full
of
deliberate
insincerities
a
mitten
for
any
hand
as
they
say
in
portsmouth
i
believe
he
would
risk
a
mutiny
if
he
had
time
enough
and
having
gained
his
own
ends
of
putting
better
men
to
shame
he
would
pose
as
the
queller
of
it
a
man
you
can
see
it
for
yourself
mr
wallingford
true
sir
i
did
not
need
to
come
to
sea
to
learn
that
man
s
character
and
wallingford
finished
his
glass
and
set
it
down
but
still
held
it
with
one
hand
stretched
out
upon
the
table
while
he
leaned
back
comfortably
against
the
bulkhead
if
our
enterprise
has
any
value
in
the
sight
of
the
nations
or
any
true
power
against
our
oppressors
it
lies
in
our
noble
cause
and
in
our
own
unselfishness
said
paul
jones
his
eyes
kindling
this
man
and
his
fellows
would
have
us
sneak
about
the
shores
of
great
britain
picking
up
an
old
man
and
a
lad
and
a
squalling
woman
from
some
coastwise
trading
smack
and
plundering
what
weak
craft
we
can
find
to
stuff
our
pockets
with
ha
pennies
we
have
a
small
ship
it
is
true
but
it
is
war
we
follow
not
thievery
i
hear
there
s
grumbling
between
decks
about
ourselves
getting
nothing
by
this
voyage
t
is
our
country
we
have
put
to
sea
for
not
ourselves
no
man
has
it
in
his
heart
more
than
i
to
confront
the
enemy
but
dickson
would
like
to
creep
along
the
coast
forever
after
small
game
and
count
up
by
night
what
he
has
taken
by
day
like
a
petty
shopkeeper
i
look
for
larger
things
or
we
might
have
stopped
at
home
i
have
my
plans
sir
the
marine
committee
have
promised
me
my
proper
ship
one
thing
that
i
can
not
brook
is
a
man
s
perfidy
i
have
good
men
aboard
but
dickson
is
not
among
them
i
feel
sometimes
as
if
i
trod
on
caltrops
i
am
outdone
wallingford
i
have
hardly
slept
these
three
nights
you
have
my
apology
sir
the
lieutenant
bowed
with
respectful
courtesy
but
said
nothing
the
captain
opened
his
eyes
a
little
wider
and
looked
amused
then
he
quickly
grew
grave
and
observed
his
guest
with
fresh
attention
there
was
a
fine
unassailable
dignity
in
wallingford
s
bearing
at
this
moment
since
you
are
aware
that
there
is
some
disaffection
sir
he
said
deliberately
i
can
only
answer
that
it
seems
to
me
there
is
but
one
course
to
follow
and
you
must
not
overrate
the
opposition
they
will
always
sit
in
judgment
upon
your
orders
and
discuss
your
measures
and
express
their
minds
freely
i
have
long
since
seen
that
our
natural
independence
of
spirit
in
new
england
makes
individual
opinion
appear
of
too
great
consequence
t
is
the
way
they
fall
upon
the
parson
s
sermon
ashore
every
monday
morning
as
for
lieutenant
simpson
i
think
him
a
very
man
though
capable
of
being
influenced
he
has
the
reputation
in
portsmouth
of
an
excellent
seaman
but
among
the
men
here
he
has
the
advantage
of
great
powers
of
wallingford
paused
as
if
to
make
his
words
more
emphatic
and
then
repeated
them
he
has
the
mastery
of
his
temper
sir
and
the
men
fear
him
he
can
stop
to
think
even
when
he
is
angry
his
gifts
are
perhaps
not
great
but
they
have
that
real
advantage
paul
jones
blazed
with
sudden
fury
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
stood
light
and
steady
there
beyond
the
table
in
spite
of
the
swaying
ship
forgive
me
sir
said
roger
wallingford
but
you
bade
us
speak
together
like
friends
i
think
you
a
far
greater
man
and
master
than
when
we
left
portsmouth
i
am
not
so
as
to
forget
to
honor
my
superiors
i
see
plainly
that
you
are
too
much
vexed
with
these
men
respect
and
admire
you
enough
to
say
so
you
must
not
expect
from
them
what
you
demand
from
yourself
in
the
worst
weather
you
could
not
have
had
a
better
crew
you
have
confessed
to
that
i
believe
you
must
have
patience
with
the
small
affairs
which
have
so
deeply
vexed
you
the
men
are
right
at
heart
you
ought
to
be
able
to
hold
them
better
than
dickson
the
captain
s
rage
had
burnt
out
like
a
straw
fire
and
he
was
himself
again
speak
on
mr
lieutenant
you
mean
kindly
he
said
and
took
his
seat
the
sweat
stood
on
his
forehead
and
his
hands
twitched
i
think
we
have
it
in
our
power
to
intimidate
the
enemy
poorly
fitted
out
as
we
are
he
said
with
calmness
but
we
must
act
like
one
man
at
least
we
all
pity
our
countrymen
who
are
starving
in
filthy
prisons
since
parliament
now
two
years
agone
authorized
the
king
to
treat
all
americans
taken
under
arms
at
sea
as
pirates
and
felons
they
have
been
stuffing
their
dungeons
with
the
innocent
and
guilty
together
what
man
seeing
his
enemy
approach
does
not
arm
himself
in
defense
we
have
made
no
retaliation
such
as
i
shall
make
now
i
have
my
plans
but
i
can
not
risk
losing
a
man
here
and
a
man
there
out
of
a
crew
like
this
before
i
adventure
a
hearty
blow
this
cuts
me
off
from
and
the
commander
of
an
american
can
not
hobnob
with
his
sailors
like
the
leader
of
a
gang
of
pirates
i
am
no
captain
kidd
nor
am
i
another
blackboard
i
can
easily
be
blocked
in
carrying
out
my
purposes
dickson
will
not
consent
to
serve
his
country
unless
he
can
fill
his
pockets
simpson
can
not
see
the
justice
of
obeying
my
orders
and
lets
his
inferiors
see
that
he
resents
them
i
wish
dickson
were
in
the
blackest
pit
of
plymouth
jail
if
i
were
the
pirate
he
would
like
to
have
me
i
d
him
quick
enough
we
may
be
overheard
sir
pleaded
wallingford
we
each
have
our
ambitions
he
continued
bravely
while
his
father
s
noble
looks
came
to
his
face
mine
are
certainly
not
dickson
s
nor
do
i
look
forward
to
a
life
at
sea
like
yourself
this
may
be
the
last
time
we
can
speak
together
on
the
terms
you
commanded
that
we
should
speak
i
look
for
no
promotion
i
am
humble
enough
about
my
fitness
to
serve
the
navy
is
but
an
accident
as
you
know
in
my
career
i
beg
you
to
command
my
hearty
service
such
as
it
is
you
have
a
right
to
it
and
you
shall
not
find
me
wanting
i
know
that
you
have
been
very
hard
placed
and
now
the
captain
bowed
courteously
in
his
turn
and
received
the
pledge
with
gratitude
but
he
kept
his
eyes
upon
the
young
man
with
growing
curiosity
wallingford
had
turned
pale
and
spoke
with
much
effort
my
heart
leaps
within
me
when
i
think
that
i
shall
soon
stand
upon
the
shore
of
france
paul
jones
went
on
for
his
guest
kept
silence
within
a
few
days
i
shall
see
the
duke
of
chartres
if
he
be
within
reach
no
man
ever
took
such
hold
of
my
affections
at
first
acquaintance
as
that
french
prince
we
knew
each
other
first
at
hampton
roads
where
he
was
with
kersaint
the
french
commodore
my
only
thought
in
boarding
him
was
to
serve
our
own
young
navy
and
get
information
for
our
but
i
was
rewarded
by
a
noble
gift
of
friendship
t
is
now
two
years
since
we
have
met
but
i
can
not
believe
that
i
shall
find
him
changed
i
can
feel
my
hand
in
his
already
he
will
give
our
enterprise
what
help
he
can
he
met
me
on
his
deck
that
day
like
a
brother
we
were
friends
from
the
first
i
told
him
my
errand
and
he
showed
me
everything
about
his
new
ship
and
even
had
copies
made
for
me
of
her
plans
t
was
before
france
and
england
had
come
to
open
trouble
and
he
was
dealing
with
a
rebel
but
he
helped
me
all
he
could
i
had
loaded
my
sloop
with
the
best
i
had
on
my
plantation
t
was
may
and
the
gardens
very
forward
i
knew
their
vessels
had
been
long
at
sea
and
could
ship
a
whole
salad
garden
i
would
not
go
to
ask
for
favors
then
without
trying
to
make
some
pleasure
in
return
but
we
were
friends
from
the
first
he
is
a
very
noble
gentleman
you
shall
see
him
soon
i
hope
and
judge
for
yourself
wallingford
listened
but
the
captain
was
still
puzzled
by
a
look
on
the
young
man
s
face
i
must
make
my
confession
said
the
lieutenant
when
i
hear
you
speak
of
such
a
friend
i
know
that
i
have
done
wrong
in
keeping
silence
sir
i
put
myself
into
your
hands
when
i
took
my
commission
i
openly
took
the
side
of
our
colonies
against
the
crown
i
am
at
heart
among
the
neutrals
t
is
ever
an
ignominious
part
to
take
i
never
could
bring
myself
to
take
the
king
s
side
against
the
country
that
bore
me
i
should
rather
curse
those
who
insisted
on
either
side
upon
this
unnatural
and
unnecessary
war
now
i
am
here
i
put
myself
very
low
i
am
at
your
mercy
captain
paul
jones
i
can
not
explain
to
you
my
immediate
reasons
but
i
have
gone
against
my
own
principles
for
the
sake
of
one
i
love
and
honor
you
may
put
irons
on
me
or
set
me
ashore
without
mercy
or
believe
that
i
still
mean
to
keep
the
oath
i
took
since
i
came
on
board
this
ship
i
have
begun
to
see
that
the
colonies
are
in
the
right
my
heart
is
with
my
oath
as
it
was
not
in
the
beginning
by
heaven
exclaimed
the
captain
staring
wallingford
do
you
mean
this
the
captain
sprang
to
his
feet
again
by
heaven
i
could
not
have
believed
this
from
another
but
i
know
you
can
speak
the
truth
give
me
your
hand
sir
give
me
your
hand
i
say
wallingford
i
have
known
men
enough
who
would
fight
for
their
principles
and
fight
well
but
you
are
the
first
i
ever
saw
who
would
fight
against
them
for
love
and
honor
s
sake
this
is
what
i
shall
do
he
went
on
rapidly
i
shall
not
iron
you
or
set
you
ashore
i
shall
hold
you
to
your
oath
i
have
no
fear
that
you
will
ever
fail
to
carry
out
my
orders
as
an
officer
of
this
ship
now
we
have
indeed
spoken
together
like
friends
they
seated
themselves
once
more
face
to
face
there
was
a
heavy
trampling
overhead
wallingford
had
a
sudden
fear
lest
this
best
hour
of
the
voyage
might
be
at
an
end
and
some
unexpected
event
summon
them
to
the
deck
but
it
was
only
some
usual
duty
of
the
sailors
his
heart
was
full
of
admiration
for
the
great
traits
of
the
captain
he
had
come
to
know
paul
jones
at
last
their
former
disastrous
attempts
at
fellowship
were
all
forgotten
a
man
might
well
keep
difficult
promises
to
such
a
chief
the
responsibilities
of
his
life
were
in
a
strong
and
by
no
means
unjust
hand
the
confession
was
made
the
confessor
had
proved
to
be
a
man
of
noble
charity
there
was
a
strange
look
of
gentleness
and
compassion
on
the
captain
s
face
his
thought
was
always
leading
him
away
from
the
past
moment
the
narrow
lodging
and
poor
comfort
of
the
ship
we
have
great
dangers
before
us
he
reflected
and
only
our
poor
human
nature
to
count
upon
t
is
the
shame
and
failures
of
past
years
that
make
us
wince
at
such
a
time
as
this
we
can
but
offer
ourselves
upon
the
altar
of
duty
and
hope
to
be
accepted
i
have
kept
a
promise
too
since
i
came
to
sea
i
was
mighty
near
to
breaking
it
this
very
day
he
added
simply
the
lieutenant
had
but
a
dim
sense
of
these
words
something
urged
him
to
make
a
still
greater
confidence
he
was
ready
to
speak
with
utter
frankness
now
to
such
a
listener
of
the
reasons
why
he
had
come
to
sea
of
the
one
he
loved
best
and
of
all
his
manly
hopes
to
tell
the
captain
everything
at
this
moment
the
captain
himself
deeply
moved
by
his
own
thoughts
reached
a
cordial
hand
across
the
table
wallingford
was
quick
to
grasp
it
and
to
pledge
his
friendship
as
he
never
had
done
before
suddenly
he
drew
back
startled
and
caught
his
hand
away
there
was
a
ring
shining
on
paul
jones
s
hand
and
the
ring
was
mary
hamilton
s
coast
of
they
goe
very
neer
to
ungratefulnesse
next
day
in
the
channel
every
heart
was
rejoiced
by
the
easy
taking
of
two
prizes
rich
vessels
from
madeira
and
malaga
with
these
in
either
hand
the
ranger
came
in
sight
of
land
after
a
quick
passage
and
little
in
debt
to
time
when
the
rough
seas
and
the
many
difficulties
of
handling
a
new
ship
were
fairly
considered
the
coast
lay
like
a
low
and
heavy
cloud
to
the
east
and
north
there
were
plenty
of
small
craft
to
be
seen
and
the
ranger
ran
within
short
distance
of
a
frigate
that
looked
like
an
englishman
she
was
standing
by
to
go
about
and
looked
majestic
and
a
worthy
defender
of
the
british
isles
every
man
on
board
was
in
a
fury
to
fight
and
sink
this
enemy
but
she
was
far
too
powerful
and
much
nobler
in
size
than
the
ranger
they
crowded
to
the
rail
there
was
plenty
of
grumbling
alow
and
aloft
lest
captain
paul
jones
should
not
dare
to
try
his
chances
a
moment
later
he
was
himself
in
a
passion
because
the
great
invincible
had
passed
easily
out
of
reach
as
if
with
insolent
unconsciousness
of
having
been
in
any
danger
dickson
who
stood
on
deck
maintained
his
usual
expression
of
aggravating
amiability
and
only
ventured
to
smile
a
little
more
openly
as
the
captain
railed
in
greater
desperation
dickson
had
a
new
grievance
to
store
away
in
his
rich
remembrance
because
he
had
been
overlooked
in
the
choice
of
prize
masters
to
bring
the
two
merchantmen
into
port
do
not
let
us
stand
in
your
way
sir
he
said
affably
some
illustrious
sea
fights
have
been
won
before
this
by
the
smaller
craft
against
the
greater
there
was
the
revenge
and
the
great
san
philip
with
her
spanish
fleet
behind
her
in
the
fight
at
flores
answered
paul
jones
on
the
instant
that
story
will
go
down
to
the
end
of
time
but
you
know
the
little
revenge
sank
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
with
all
her
men
who
were
left
alive
their
glory
could
not
sink
but
i
did
not
know
you
ever
shipped
for
glory
s
sake
mr
dickson
and
dickson
turned
a
leaden
color
under
his
sallow
skin
but
said
nothing
at
least
our
first
duty
now
is
to
be
prudent
continued
the
captain
i
must
only
fight
to
win
my
first
duty
is
to
make
my
way
to
port
before
we
venture
upon
too
much
bravery
there
ll
be
fighting
soon
enough
and
i
hope
glory
enough
for
all
of
us
this
day
four
weeks
i
own
it
grieves
me
to
see
that
frigate
leave
us
she
s
almost
hull
down
already
he
exclaimed
regretfully
with
a
seaward
glance
as
he
went
to
his
cabin
presently
he
appeared
again
as
if
he
thought
no
more
of
the
with
a
favorite
worn
copy
of
thomson
s
poems
in
hand
and
began
to
walk
the
deck
to
and
fro
as
he
read
on
this
fair
winter
morning
the
ship
drove
busily
along
the
wind
was
out
of
the
west
they
were
running
along
the
breton
coast
and
there
was
more
and
more
pleasure
and
relief
at
finding
the
hard
voyage
so
near
its
end
the
men
were
all
on
deck
or
clustered
thick
in
the
rigging
they
made
a
good
ship
s
company
the
captain
on
his
was
pacing
off
his
exercise
with
great
spirit
and
repeating
some
lines
of
poetry
aloud
with
such
mad
seas
the
daring
gama
fought
for
many
a
day
and
many
a
dreadful
night
incessant
lab
ring
round
the
stormy
cape
by
hold
ambition
led
the
wide
enlivening
air
is
full
of
fate
then
he
paused
a
moment
still
waving
the
book
at
arm
s
length
as
if
he
were
following
the
metre
silently
in
his
own
mind
on
sarum
s
plain
i
met
a
wandering
fair
the
look
of
sorrow
lovely
still
she
bore
he
s
gettin
ready
to
meet
the
ladies
said
cooper
who
was
within
listening
distance
polishing
a
piece
of
brass
on
one
of
the
guns
i
can
t
say
as
we
ve
had
much
po
try
at
sea
this
v
y
ge
sir
he
continued
to
lieutenant
wallingford
who
crossed
the
deck
toward
him
as
the
captain
disappeared
above
on
his
forward
stretch
cooper
and
wallingford
were
old
friends
ashore
with
many
memories
in
common
the
lieutenant
was
pale
and
severe
the
ready
smile
that
made
him
seem
more
boyish
than
his
years
was
strangely
absent
he
had
suddenly
taken
on
the
looks
of
a
man
ain
t
you
feelin
well
sir
asked
cooper
with
solicitude
things
is
all
doin
well
though
there
s
those
aboard
that
won
t
have
us
think
so
if
they
can
help
it
when
i
was
on
watch
i
see
you
writin
very
late
these
nights
past
you
will
excuse
my
boldness
but
we
all
want
the
little
sleep
we
get
t
is
a
strain
on
a
man
unused
to
life
at
sea
i
shall
write
no
more
this
voyage
said
wallingford
touched
by
the
kindness
of
old
cooper
s
feeling
but
impatient
at
the
boyish
relation
with
an
older
man
and
dreading
a
word
about
home
affairs
he
was
an
officer
now
and
must
resent
such
things
then
the
color
rushed
to
his
face
he
was
afraid
that
tears
would
shame
him
with
a
sudden
impulse
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
package
of
letters
tied
together
ready
for
sending
home
and
flung
them
overboard
with
an
angry
toss
it
was
as
if
his
heart
went
after
them
it
was
a
poor
return
for
cooper
s
innocent
kindness
the
good
man
had
known
him
since
he
had
been
in
the
world
old
susan
his
elder
sister
was
chief
among
the
household
at
home
this
was
a
most
distressing
moment
and
the
lieutenant
turned
aside
and
leaned
his
elbow
on
the
gun
bending
a
little
as
if
to
see
under
the
sail
whether
the
were
still
in
sight
the
little
package
of
letters
was
on
its
slow
way
down
through
the
pale
green
water
the
fishes
were
dodging
as
it
sank
to
the
dim
depths
where
it
must
lie
and
drown
and
tiny
shells
would
fasten
upon
the
substance
of
its
folds
the
words
that
he
had
written
would
but
darken
a
little
salt
water
with
their
useless
ink
he
had
written
them
as
he
could
never
write
again
in
those
long
lonely
hours
at
sea
under
the
dim
lamp
in
his
close
cabin
hours
made
warm
and
shining
with
the
thought
and
promise
of
love
that
also
hoped
and
waited
all
a
young
man
s
dream
was
there
there
were
tiny
sketches
of
the
ranger
s
decks
and
the
men
in
the
rigging
done
into
the
close
text
alas
there
was
his
mother
s
letter
too
he
had
written
them
both
the
letters
they
would
be
looking
and
longing
for
and
sent
them
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
if
he
had
them
back
mary
hamilton
s
should
go
to
her
to
show
her
what
she
had
done
and
in
this
unexpected
moment
he
felt
her
wondering
eyes
upon
him
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
keep
from
sobbing
over
the
gun
he
had
seen
the
ring
tis
ashore
headache
coming
on
with
this
over
the
water
said
cooper
still
watching
him
i
d
go
and
lie
in
the
dark
a
bit
it
was
not
like
wallingford
but
there
had
been
plenty
of
drinking
the
night
before
and
gaming
too
boy
might
have
got
into
trouble
the
lusitanian
prince
who
to
love
of
useful
glory
roused
mankind
they
both
heard
the
captain
at
his
loud
orations
but
he
stopped
for
a
moment
and
looked
down
at
the
lieutenant
as
if
about
to
speak
and
then
turned
on
his
heel
and
paced
away
again
the
shore
seemed
to
move
a
long
step
nearer
with
every
hour
the
old
seafarers
among
the
crew
gave
knowing
glances
at
the
coast
and
were
full
of
wisest
information
in
regard
to
the
harbor
of
nantes
toward
which
they
were
making
all
possible
speed
dickson
who
was
in
command
came
now
to
reprimand
cooper
for
his
idleness
and
set
him
to
his
duty
sharply
being
a
great
lover
of
authority
wallingford
left
his
place
by
the
trunnion
and
disappeared
below
on
the
sick
list
inquired
dickson
of
the
captain
who
reappeared
and
again
glanced
down
but
the
captain
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
made
no
reply
he
was
sincerely
sorry
to
have
somehow
put
a
bar
between
himself
and
his
young
officer
just
at
this
moment
wallingford
was
a
fellow
and
as
good
a
gentleman
as
the
duke
of
chartres
himself
the
sight
of
such
a
second
would
lend
credit
to
their
enterprise
among
the
frenchmen
simpson
was
bringing
in
one
of
the
prizes
and
as
for
dickson
he
was
a
common
trading
sort
of
sneak
the
dispatches
from
congress
to
announce
the
surrender
of
burgoyne
lay
ready
to
the
captain
s
hand
for
the
bringing
of
such
welcome
news
to
the
american
commissioners
and
to
france
herself
he
should
certainly
have
a
place
among
good
french
seamen
and
officers
he
stamped
his
foot
impatiently
the
moment
he
was
on
shore
he
must
post
to
paris
to
lay
the
dispatches
in
franklin
s
hand
they
were
directed
to
glory
herself
in
sympathetic
ink
on
the
part
of
the
captain
of
the
ranger
but
this
could
not
be
read
by
common
eyes
above
the
titles
of
the
philadelphia
envoy
at
his
lodgings
in
passy
after
reflecting
upon
these
things
paul
jones
again
in
a
tender
mood
took
a
paper
out
of
his
pocketbook
and
reread
a
song
of
allan
ramsay
s
at
setting
day
and
rising
moon
which
a
young
virginia
girl
had
copied
for
him
in
a
neat
painful
little
hand
poor
maid
he
said
with
gentle
affectionateness
as
he
folded
the
paper
again
carefully
poor
maid
i
shall
not
forget
to
do
her
some
great
kindness
if
my
hopes
come
true
and
my
life
continues
now
i
must
send
for
wallingford
and
speak
with
him
is
the
soul
that
when
good
and
faire
in
one
person
life
at
colonel
hamilton
s
house
went
on
with
as
steady
current
as
the
great
river
that
passed
its
walls
the
raising
of
men
and
money
for
a
distressed
army
with
what
survived
of
his
duties
toward
a
great
shipping
business
kept
hamilton
himself
ceaselessly
busy
often
there
came
an
anxious
company
of
citizens
riding
down
the
lane
to
consult
upon
public
affairs
there
was
an
increasing
number
of
guests
of
humbler
condition
who
sought
a
rich
man
s
house
to
plead
their
poverty
the
winter
looked
long
and
resourceless
to
these
troubled
souls
there
were
old
mothers
who
had
been
left
on
lonely
farms
when
their
sons
had
gone
to
war
there
was
a
continued
asking
of
unanswerable
questions
about
the
soldiers
return
while
younger
women
came
pale
and
desperate
with
little
troops
of
children
pulling
at
their
skirts
when
one
appealing
group
left
the
door
another
might
be
seen
coming
to
take
its
place
the
improvident
suffered
first
and
made
loudest
complaint
later
there
were
discoveries
of
want
that
had
been
too
uncomplainingly
borne
the
families
of
berwick
were
sometimes
brought
to
straits
themselves
in
their
effort
to
succor
their
poorer
neighbors
mary
hamilton
looked
graver
and
older
all
the
bright
elation
of
her
heart
had
gone
as
if
a
long
arctic
night
were
setting
in
instead
of
a
plain
new
england
winter
with
its
lengthening
days
and
bright
january
sun
at
no
great
distance
she
could
not
put
madam
wallingford
s
sorrow
out
of
mind
she
was
thankful
to
be
so
busy
in
the
great
house
like
a
new
dorcas
with
her
gifts
of
garments
but
the
shadow
of
war
seemed
more
and
more
to
give
these
days
a
deeper
darkness
there
was
no
snow
on
the
ground
so
late
in
the
sad
year
there
was
still
a
touch
of
faded
greenness
on
the
fields
one
afternoon
mary
came
across
the
flagstoned
court
toward
the
stables
tempted
by
the
milder
air
to
take
a
holiday
though
the
vane
still
held
by
the
northwest
that
great
wind
was
not
dead
but
only
drowsy
in
the
early
afternoon
and
now
and
then
a
breath
of
it
swept
down
the
country
old
peggy
had
followed
her
young
mistress
to
the
door
and
still
stood
there
watching
with
affectionate
eyes
my
poor
darlin
said
the
good
soul
to
herself
and
mary
turned
to
look
back
at
her
with
a
smile
she
thought
peggy
was
at
her
usual
grumbling
bless
ye
we
ve
all
got
to
have
patience
said
the
old
housekeeper
again
looking
wistfully
at
the
girl
whose
tired
face
had
touched
her
very
heart
as
if
this
quick
wave
of
unwonted
feeling
were
spread
to
all
the
air
about
mary
s
own
eyes
filled
with
tears
she
tried
to
go
on
and
then
turned
and
ran
back
she
put
her
arms
round
peggy
there
in
the
doorway
i
am
only
going
for
a
ride
kiss
me
peggy
me
just
as
you
did
when
i
was
a
little
girl
things
do
worry
me
so
oh
peggy
dear
you
don
t
know
i
can
t
tell
anybody
there
there
darlin
somebody
ll
see
you
don
t
you
go
to
huggin
this
dry
old
thrashin
o
straw
no
don
t
you
take
notice
bout
an
old
withered
corn
shuck
like
me
she
protested
but
her
face
shone
with
tenderness
go
have
your
ride
an
i
m
goin
to
make
ye
a
pretty
cake
t
will
be
all
nice
and
crusty
i
was
goin
to
make
you
one
anyway
i
tell
ye
things
is
all
comin
right
in
the
end
there
le
me
button
your
little
cape
and
so
they
parted
peggy
marched
back
into
the
great
kitchen
without
her
accustomed
looks
of
disapproval
at
the
maids
and
dropped
into
the
corner
of
the
settle
next
the
fire
she
put
out
her
lame
foot
in
its
shuffling
shoe
and
looked
at
it
as
if
there
were
no
other
object
of
commiseration
in
the
world
t
is
a
shame
to
be
wearin
out
so
fine
made
as
i
was
the
lord
give
me
a
good
smart
body
but
tis
beginnin
to
fail
an
go
said
the
old
woman
impatiently
once
t
would
ha
took
twice
yisterday
s
work
to
tire
foot
or
back
o
me
i
m
dreadful
spent
myself
bein
up
arly
an
late
we
car
ied
an
upstropelous
sight
o
dishes
to
an
fro
don
t
see
no
vally
in
feedin
a
whole
neighborhood
when
best
part
on
em
s
only
too
lazy
to
provide
theirselves
murmured
one
of
the
younger
handmaidens
who
was
languidly
scouring
a
great
pewter
platter
whereat
peggy
rose
in
her
wrath
and
set
the
complainer
a
stint
of
afternoon
work
sufficient
to
cast
a
heavy
shadow
over
the
freshest
spirit
of
industry
the
mistress
of
these
had
gone
her
way
to
the
long
stables
where
a
saddle
was
being
put
on
her
favorite
horse
and
stood
in
the
wide
doorway
looking
down
the
river
the
tide
was
out
the
last
brown
leaves
of
the
poplars
were
flying
off
some
close
lower
branches
there
was
a
touch
of
north
in
the
wind
but
the
sun
was
clear
and
bright
for
the
time
of
year
mary
was
dressed
in
a
warm
habit
of
green
cloth
with
a
close
hood
like
a
child
s
tied
under
her
chin
the
long
skirt
was
full
of
sharp
creases
where
it
had
lain
all
summer
in
one
of
the
east
indian
chests
and
a
fragrance
of
camphor
and
eastern
spices
blew
out
as
the
heavy
folds
came
to
the
air
the
old
coachman
was
busy
with
the
last
girth
and
soothed
the
young
horse
as
he
circled
about
the
floor
then
with
a
last
fond
stroke
of
a
shining
shoulder
he
gave
mary
his
hand
and
mounted
her
light
as
a
feather
to
the
saddle
he
s
terrible
fresh
said
the
old
master
of
horse
as
he
drew
the
riding
skirt
in
place
with
a
careful
touch
have
a
care
missy
mary
thanked
the
old
man
with
a
gentle
smile
and
took
heed
that
the
horse
walked
quietly
away
when
she
turned
the
corner
beyond
the
shipyard
she
dropped
the
curb
rein
and
the
strong
young
creature
flew
straight
away
like
an
arrow
from
the
bowstring
mind
your
first
wind
now
t
is
a
good
thing
to
keep
said
the
rider
gayly
and
leaned
forward
as
they
slackened
pace
for
a
moment
on
the
pitch
of
the
hill
to
pat
the
horse
s
neck
and
toss
a
handful
of
flying
mane
back
to
its
place
until
the
first
pleasure
and
impulse
of
speed
were
past
there
was
no
time
to
think
or
even
to
remember
any
trouble
of
mind
for
the
first
time
in
many
days
all
the
motive
power
of
life
did
not
seem
to
come
from
herself
the
fields
of
berwick
were
already
beginning
to
wear
that
look
of
smoothness
which
belongs
only
to
lands
in
an
old
country
the
first
colonists
and
pilgrims
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
before
might
now
return
to
find
their
dreams
had
borne
fair
fruit
in
this
likeness
to
england
that
had
come
upon
a
landscape
hard
wrung
from
the
wilderness
the
long
slopes
the
gently
rounded
knolls
that
seemed
to
gather
and
to
hold
the
wintry
sunshine
the
bushy
field
corners
and
hedgerows
of
wild
cherry
that
crossed
the
shoulders
of
the
higher
hills
would
be
pleasant
to
those
homesick
english
eyes
in
the
new
country
they
had
toiled
so
hard
to
win
the
river
that
made
its
way
by
shelter
and
covert
of
the
hilly
country
of
field
and
pasture
river
must
for
many
a
year
have
been
looked
at
wistfully
because
it
was
the
only
road
home
portsmouth
might
have
been
all
for
this
world
while
plymouth
was
all
for
the
next
but
the
berwick
farms
were
made
by
neither
easy
to
transplant
in
the
first
place
nor
easy
now
to
uproot
again
the
northern
mountains
were
as
blue
as
if
it
were
a
day
in
spring
they
looked
as
if
the
warm
mist
of
april
hung
over
them
as
if
they
were
the
outposts
of
another
world
whose
climate
and
cares
were
of
another
and
gentler
sort
and
there
was
no
more
fretting
or
losing
and
no
more
war
either
by
land
or
sea
the
road
was
up
and
down
all
the
way
over
the
hills
winding
and
turning
among
the
upper
farms
that
lay
along
the
riverside
above
the
salmon
fall
now
and
then
a
wood
road
or
footpath
shortened
the
way
dark
under
the
black
hemlocks
and
sunshiny
again
past
the
old
garrison
houses
goodwins
plaisteds
spencers
keays
and
wentworths
had
all
sent
their
captives
through
the
winter
snows
to
canada
in
the
old
french
and
indian
wars
and
had
stood
in
their
lot
and
place
for
many
a
generation
to
suffer
attacks
by
savage
stealth
at
their
quiet
ploughing
or
confront
an
army
s
strength
and
fury
of
firebrand
and
organized
assault
there
was
the
ford
to
cross
at
wooster
s
river
noisy
stream
which
can
never
be
silent
as
if
the
horror
of
a
great
battle
fought
upon
its
bank
could
never
be
told
here
there
was
always
a
good
modern
moment
of
excitement
the
young
horse
must
whirl
about
and
rear
and
show
horror
in
his
turn
as
if
the
ghosts
of
hertel
and
his
french
and
indians
stood
upon
the
historic
spot
of
their
victory
over
the
poor
settlers
finally
the
duke
stepped
trembling
into
the
bright
shallow
water
and
then
stopped
midway
with
perfect
composure
for
a
drink
then
they
journeyed
up
the
steep
battleground
and
presently
caught
the
sound
of
roaring
water
at
the
great
falls
heavy
with
the
latter
rains
on
the
crest
of
the
hill
mary
overtook
a
woman
who
was
wearily
carrying
a
child
that
looked
large
enough
to
walk
alone
but
his
cheeks
were
streaked
with
tears
and
there
were
no
shoes
on
his
little
feet
to
tread
the
frozen
road
only
some
worn
rags
wrapped
them
clumsily
about
mary
held
back
her
horse
and
reached
down
for
the
poor
little
thing
to
take
him
before
her
on
the
saddle
the
child
twisted
determinedly
in
her
arms
to
get
a
look
at
her
face
and
then
cuddled
against
his
new
friend
with
great
content
he
took
fast
hold
of
the
right
arm
which
held
him
and
looked
proudly
down
at
his
mother
who
relieved
of
her
extra
burden
stepped
briskly
alongside
goin
up
country
to
stay
with
my
folks
she
answered
mary
s
question
of
her
journey

nothin

the
woman
bitterly
with
a
look
at
the
beautiful
horse
which
easily
outstepped
her
alas
we
can
t
do
everything
said
mary
sadly
and
there
was
something
in
her
voice
which
touched
the
complainer
s
heart
i
guess
you
would
if
you
could
she
answered
simply
and
then
mary
s
own
heart
was
warmed
again
the
road
still
led
northward
along
the
high
uplands
above
the
river
all
the
northern
hills
and
the
mountains
of
ossipee
looked
dark
now
in
a
solemn
row
mary
turned
her
horse
into
a
narrow
track
off
the
highroad
and
leaned
over
to
give
the
comforted
child
into
his
mother
s
arms
he
slipped
to
ground
of
his
own
accord
and
trotted
gayly
along
look
at
them
pore
little
feet
i
wisht
he
had
some
shoes

the
storekeeper

parted
but
mary
s
head
drooped
sorrowfully
as
she
rode
among
the
gray
birches
on
her
shorter
way
to
the
high
slopes
of
pine
hill
this
piece
of
country
had
years
before
furnished
some
of
the
noblest
masts
that
were
ever
landed
on
english
shores
the
ruined
stump
of
that
great
pine
which
was
the
wonder
of
the
king
s
dockyards
and
had
loaded
one
of
the
old
mastships
with
its
tons
of
timber
could
still
be
seen
though
shrunken
and
soft
with
moss
a
fox
large
in
his
new
winter
fur
went
sneaking
across
the
way
and
the
young
horse
pranced
gayly
at
the
sight
of
him
while
mary
noticed
his
track
and
the
way
it
led
for
her
brother
s
sake
and
turned
aside
across
the
pasture
until
she
had
a
sportsman
s
satisfaction
in
seeing
the
fox
make
toward
a
rough
ledgy
bit
of
ground
and
warm
thicket
of
underbrush
at
a
spring
head
this
would
be
good
news
for
poor
old
jack
who
might
take
no
time
for
hunting
but
could
dream
of
it
any
night
after
supper
like
a
happy
dog
before
his
own
fire
on
the
heights
of
the
great
ridge
some
of
the
elder
generation
of
trees
were
still
standing
left
because
they
were
crooked
and
unfit
for
the
mastships
cargoes
they
were
monarchs
of
the
whole
landscape
and
waved
their
long
boughs
in
the
wintry
wind
mary
hamilton
had
known
them
in
her
earliest
childhood
and
looked
toward
them
now
with
happy
recognition
as
if
within
their
hard
seasoned
shapes
their
hearts
were
conscious
of
other
existences
and
affection
like
her
own
she
stopped
the
fleet
horse
on
the
top
of
the
hill
and
laid
her
hand
upon
the
bark
of
a
huge
pine
then
she
looked
off
at
the
lower
country
the
sight
of
it
was
a
challenge
to
adventure
a
great
horizon
sets
the
boundaries
of
the
inner
life
of
man
wider
to
match
itself
and
something
that
had
bound
the
girl
s
heart
too
closely
seemed
to
slip
easily
away
she
smiled
and
took
a
long
breath
and
turning
rode
down
the
rough
pasture
again
and
along
the
field
toward
the
river
her
heavy
riding
dress
filled
and
flew
with
the
cold
northwest
wind
and
a
bright
color
came
back
to
her
cheeks
to
stand
on
the
bleak
height
had
freed
her
spirit
and
sent
her
back
to
the
lower
countries
of
life
happier
than
she
came
it
was
said
long
ago
that
one
may
not
sweep
away
a
fog
but
one
may
climb
the
hills
of
life
and
look
over
it
altogether
she
leaped
the
horse
lightly
over
some
bars
that
gave
a
surly
sort
of
entrance
to
a
farm
and
rode
toward
the
low
house
suddenly
from
behind
a
thorn
bush
there
appeared
a
strange
figure
and
bent
almost
double
under
a
stack
of
dry
beanstalks
the
bearer
seemed
to
have
uprooted
her
clumsy
burden
in
a
fury
she
tramped
along
while
the
horse
took
to
shying
at
the
sight
and
had
to
be
pacified
with
much
firmness
and
patience
the
bean
stack
at
last
ceased
its
angry
progress
and
stood
still
what
s
all
that
thromping
keep
away
wit
yourself
then
whoiver
ye
are
i
can
only
see
the
ground
by
me
two
feet
ye
ll
not
ride
over
me
keep
back
now
till
i
m
gone
screamed
the
shrill
voice
of
an
old
woman
it
is
i
mary
hamilton
said
the
girl
laughing
you
ve
frightened
the
duke
almost
to
death
sullivan
i
can
hold
him
but
do
let
me
get
by
before
you
bob
at
him
again
there
was
a
scornful
laugh
out
of
the
moving
ambush
get
out
of
me
road
then
the
two
of
ye
and
the
bean
stack
moved
angrily
away
its
transfixing
pole
piercing
the
air
like
a
disguised
unicorn
the
two
small
feet
below
were
well
shod
and
sturdy
like
a
boy
s
the
whole
figure
was
so
short
that
the
dry
vines
trailed
on
the
ground
more
and
more
until
it
appeared
as
if
the
tangled
mass
were
rolling
uphill
by
its
own
volition
mary
went
on
with
the
trembling
horse
a
moment
later
she
walked
quickly
up
the
slope
to
the
gray
wooden
house
there
was
the
handsome
head
of
a
very
old
man
reading
close
to
the
window
as
she
passed
but
he
did
not
look
up
until
she
had
shut
the
door
behind
her
and
stood
within
the
little
room
then
master
sullivan
the
exile
closed
his
book
and
sprang
to
his
feet
a
tall
and
ancient
figure
with
the
manners
of
a
prince
he
bent
to
kiss
the
hand
of
his
guest
and
looked
at
her
silently
before
he
spoke
with
an
unconscious
eagerness
of
affection
equal
to
her
own
a
thousand
welcomes
he
said
at
last
i
should
have
seen
you
coming
you
have
had
no
one
to
serve
you
i
was
on
the
sabine
farm
with
horace
t
is
far
enough
away
he
added
with
a
smile
i
like
to
fasten
my
horse
myself
answered
mary
t
is
best
i
should
he
makes
it
a
point
of
honor
then
to
stand
still
and
wait
for
me
and
resents
a
stranger
s
hand
being
young
and
impatient
mary
looked
bright
and
smiling
she
threw
back
her
close
green
hood
and
her
face
bloomed
out
of
it
like
a
flower
as
she
stood
before
the
gallant
frail
old
man
there
was
a
terrible
little
bean
stack
that
came
up
the
hill
beside
us
she
went
on
as
if
to
amuse
him
and
i
heard
a
voice
out
of
it
and
saw
two
steady
feet
that
i
knew
to
be
sullivan
s
but
my
black
duke
was
pleased
to
be
frightened
out
of
his
wits
and
so
we
have
all
parted
on
bad
terms
this
dark
day
she
will
shine
upon
you
like
a
may
morning
when
she
comes
in
then
said
master
sullivan
she
s
in
a
huge
toil
the
day
with
sure
news
of
a
great
storm
that
s
coming
stay
a
while
i
begged
her
stay
a
while
my
dear
the
wind
is
in
a
fury
and
an
indeed
cried
the
master
s
wife
bursting
in
at
the
door
half
a
wild
brownie
and
half
a
tame
enough
grandmotherly
old
soul
an
i
ve
heard
nothing
but
from
ye
all
my
life
long
an
here
s
the
hand
of
winter
upon
us
again
an
thank
god
all
me
poor
little
crops
is
under
cover
an
no
praise
to
yourself
the
old
man
held
out
his
slender
hand
she
did
not
take
it
but
her
face
began
to
shine
with
affection
thank
god
t
is
yourself
miss
mary
hamilton
my
dear
she
exclaimed
dropping
a
curtsy
my
old
gentleman
here
has
been
sorrowing
for
a
sight
of
your
fair
face
these
many
days
t
is
in
december
like
this
we
do
be
sighing
after
the
may
i
don
t
know
have
ye
brought
any
news
yet
from
the
ship
oh
no
not
yet
said
mary
no
there
is
no
news
yet
from
the
ranger
i
have
had
good
dreams
of
her
then
announced
the
old
creature
with
triumph
listen
there
s
quarrels
amongst
em
but
they
ll
come
safe
to
shore
with
gold
in
everybody
s
two
hands
she
crossed
the
room
and
drew
her
lesser
wheel
close
to
her
knee
and
began
to
spin
busily
remnant
of
another
simple
and
true
i
share
with
all
the
treasures
of
a
kindly
mind
and
in
my
cottage
poor
and
small
the
great
a
welcome
find
i
vex
not
gods
nor
patron
friend
for
larger
gifts
or
ampler
store
my
modest
sabine
farm
can
lend
all
that
i
want
and
more
they
sat
in
silence
was
pleasure
enough
to
be
together
mary
knew
that
she
must
wait
until
master
sullivan
himself
made
opportunity
for
speaking
of
the
things
which
filled
her
heart
have
i
ever
told
you
that
my
father
was
a
friend
in
his
young
days
of
christopher
milton
brother
to
the
great
poet
but
opposite
in
politics
he
asked
as
if
this
were
the
one
important
fact
to
be
made
clear
a
stuart
partisan
a
violent
churchman
and
a
most
tory
and
the
old
master
laughed
with
sincere
amusement
as
mary
looked
up
eager
to
hear
more
voltaire
too
had
just
such
a
contradiction
of
a
brother
credulous
and
full
of
superstitions
perfect
jansenist
of
those
days
yes
i
was
reading
horace
when
you
came
but
for
very
homesickness
he
can
make
a
man
forget
all
his
own
affairs
such
are
his
polite
hospitalities
of
the
mind
these
dark
autumn
days
mind
me
every
year
of
paris
when
they
come
as
april
weather
makes
me
weep
for
childhood
and
the
tears
and
smiles
of
ireland
the
old
days
in
your
collége
mary
prompted
him
in
the
moment
s
silence
those
are
your
paris
days
i
love
the
best
oh
the
men
i
have
known
he
answered
i
can
sit
here
in
my
chair
and
watch
them
all
go
by
again
down
the
narrow
streets
i
have
seen
the
abbé
de
châteauneuf
pass
with
his
inseparable
copy
of
racine
sticking
out
of
his
pocket
i
often
hid
from
him
too
in
the
shadow
of
an
archway
with
a
young
boy
his
pupil
and
my
own
schoolfellow
who
had
run
away
from
his
tasks
he
was
four
years
younger
than
i
petit
we
called
him
then
who
proves
now
to
be
the
very
great
voltaire
ah
t
was
an
idle
flock
of
us
that
ranged
the
old
cloisters
in
cap
and
gown
t
was
the
best
blood
in
france
i
have
seen
the
illustrious
duke
de
boufflers
handsomely
flogged
for
shooting
peas
at
dull
old
lejay
the
professor
we
were
the
same
age
monsieur
de
boufflers
and
i
we
were
great
friends
and
often
flogged
in
company
for
our
deviltries
he
was
a
colonel
of
the
french
army
in
that
moment
and
bore
the
title
of
governor
of
flanders
but
on
the
day
of
the
they
flogged
him
so
that
i
cried
out
at
the
sight
and
turned
to
the
wall
sick
at
heart
as
for
him
he
sobbed
all
night
afterward
and
caught
his
breath
in
misery
next
morning
while
we
read
our
epictetus
from
the
same
book
we
knelt
together
before
the
high
altar
and
vowed
to
kill
lejay
by
dagger
or
poison
before
the
month
s
end
t
was
a
good
vow
but
well
broken
the
old
man
laughed
again
and
made
a
gay
french
gesture
mary
laughed
with
him
and
they
had
a
fine
moment
together
you
were
not
always
like
that
must
have
learned
your
lessons
it
was
not
all
idleness
mary
protested
to
lead
him
on
the
old
fathers
taught
us
with
all
their
power
to
gain
some
skill
in
the
use
of
words
reflected
the
master
soberly
yes
and
i
learned
to
fence
too
at
the
college
a
student
of
could
always
speak
like
a
gentleman
but
we
had
to
play
with
our
words
t
was
the
most
important
of
all
our
science
les
sottises
toujours
les
sottises
grumbled
the
old
man
yes
they
made
a
high
profession
then
of
talking
nonsense
though
france
was
whipped
at
blenheim
and
lost
the
great
fight
at
malplaquet
they
could
laugh
at
the
ruined
convent
of
port
royal
and
the
distresses
of
saintly
souls
but
they
taught
us
to
talk
nonsense
and
to
dress
with
elegance
and
to
be
agreeable
to
ladies
the
end
is
not
yet
the
throne
of
france
will
shake
some
day
until
heads
fall
in
the
dust
like
fruit
that
nobody
stoops
to
gather
the
master
fell
to
himself
as
if
he
had
forgotten
that
he
had
a
listener
i
saw
some
signs
of
it
too
i
knew
there
when
i
was
a
lad
le
tellier
the
king
s
confessor
who
was
the
true
ruler
of
france
i
rode
to
denis
myself
the
day
of
the
old
king
s
funeral
and
it
was
like
a
fair
people
were
singing
and
drinking
in
the
booths
and
no
one
all
along
the
way
but
had
his
gibe
at
le
tellier
whose
day
was
over
thank
god
ah
but
i
was
a
gay
lad
then
i
knew
no
country
but
france
and
i
can
not
but
love
her
yet
i
was
only
a
frenchman
of
my
gay
and
reckless
time
there
was
saving
grace
for
me
and
i
passed
it
by
for
i
knew
the
great
fénelon
and
god
forgive
my
sins
but
i
have
been
his
poor
parishioner
from
those
days
to
these
i
knew
his
nephew
the
abbé
de
beaumont
and
i
rode
with
him
in
the
holidays
to
cambrai
tiresome
journey
but
we
were
young
and
we
stayed
in
the
good
archbishop
s
house
and
heard
him
preach
and
say
mass
he
was
the
best
of
christians
i
might
have
been
a
worse
man
but
for
that
noble
saint
yes
i
have
seen
the
face
of
the
great
fénelon
and
master
sullivan
bent
his
head
and
blessed
himself
the
unconscious
habit
of
his
youth
served
best
to
express
the
reverence
which
lay
deep
in
his
aged
heart
i
think
now
as
i
look
back
on
those
far
days
that
my
good
archbishop
was
the
greatest
prince
and
saint
of
them
all
my
dear
child
said
the
old
teacher
looking
up
gently
from
his
reverie
into
mary
hamilton
s
face
you
belong
to
another
world
mon
maître
said
the
girl
affectionately
how
much
you
could
teach
us
if
we
were
but
fit
to
learn
the
old
man
gave
an
impatient
fling
of
his
hand
i
am
past
eighty
years
old
my
darling
he
answered
god
knows
i
have
not
been
fit
to
learn
of
the
best
of
men
else
i
might
now
be
one
of
the
wisest
of
mankind
i
have
lived
in
the
great
days
of
france
but
i
tell
you
plain
i
have
lived
in
none
that
are
fuller
of
the
seeds
of
greatness
than
these
i
live
now
in
my
sons
and
our
irish
veins
are
full
of
soldier
s
blood
t
is
here
country
of
the
young
my
boys
have
their
mother
s
energy
thank
god
as
for
me
my
little
school
is
more
alive
than
i
there
is
always
a
bright
child
in
every
flock
for
whose
furthering
a
man
may
well
spend
himself
t
is
a
long
look
back
the
light
of
life
shone
bright
with
me
in
its
beginning
but
the
oil
in
the
old
lamp
is
burning
low
my
forbears
were
all
but
the
rest
of
their
brief
days
are
added
to
the
length
of
mine
t
is
not
every
man
has
made
so
many
others
fit
to
take
their
part
in
life
said
mary
think
of
your
own
sons
master
ay
my
sons
said
the
old
man
pleased
to
the
heart
and
they
have
their
mother
s
beauty
and
energy
to
couple
with
their
sad
old
father
s
gift
of
dreams
the
princes
of
beare
and
bantry
are
cousins
to
the
banshee
and
she
whispers
me
many
things
i
sometimes
fear
that
my
son
john
the
general
has
too
much
prudence
the
whisperer
and
prudence
are
not
of
kin
there
was
a
new
silence
then
and
when
master
sullivan
spoke
again
it
was
with
a
sharp
questioning
look
in
his
eyes
what
said
your
little
admiral
at
parting
i
heard
that
he
was
fretted
with
the
poor
outfitting
of
his
ship
and
sailed
away
with
scant
thanks
to
the
authorities
prudence
can
not
deal
with
such
a
man
as
that
what
of
our
boy
roger
how
fares
the
poor
mother
since
she
lost
him
out
of
her
sight
t
was
anxious
news
they
brought
me
of
his
going
when
my
first
pride
had
blazed
down
you
might
have
seen
an
old
man
s
tears
mary
looked
up
she
flushed
and
made
as
if
she
would
speak
but
remained
silent
you
ll
never
make
soldier
or
sailor
of
him
boy
or
man
the
lord
meant
him
for
a
country
gentleman
said
the
master
warningly
and
at
this
moment
all
mary
s
hopes
of
reassurance
fell
to
the
ground
my
son
john
is
a
soldier
born
he
continued
coldly
he
could
tell
you
where
the
troops
were
placed
in
every
battle
from
old
troy
down
to
the
siege
of
louisburg
mary
began
to
speak
and
again
something
ailed
her
throat
she
turned
and
looked
toward
the
fireside
where
the
old
housemother
was
knitting
now
and
humming
a
strange
old
irish
tune
to
herself
she
had
left
them
to
themselves
as
much
as
if
she
were
miles
away
incipit
vita
nova
said
the
master
under
his
breath
and
went
on
as
if
he
were
unobservant
of
mary
s
startled
look
captain
paul
jones
is
a
man
of
the
world
and
wallingford
is
a
country
gentleman
of
the
best
sort
he
continued
they
may
not
understand
each
other
at
these
close
quarters
i
mind
me
of
pushing
adventurers
in
my
old
days
who
came
from
the
back
corner
of
nowhere
and
yet
knew
the
worst
and
the
best
of
paris
how
they
would
wink
at
their
fellows
when
some
noble
boy
came
to
see
the
world
from
one
of
the
poor
and
proud
châteaux
of
brittany
or
the
far
south
roger
is
and
you
have
called
him
your
own
best
scholar
of
these
later
days
insisted
mary
with
a
touch
of
indignation
with
such
kindred
in
boston
and
the
company
of
his
father
s
friends
from
childhood
he
is
not
so
new
to
the
world
ecce
deus
fortior
me
qui
veniens
dominabitur
mihi
the
old
man
repeated
softly
as
if
he
were
saying
a
short
prayer
then
glanced
again
at
the
girl
s
beautiful
young
face
and
pleading
eyes
well
the
gallant
lads
have
sailed
he
exclaimed
with
delighted
eagerness
and
no
apparent
concern
for
his
listener
s
opinion
they
ll
be
in
good
season
too
in
spite
of
all
delays
what
say
the
loud
patriots
now
who
are
so
full
of
fighting
and
yet
find
good
excuse
for
staying
at
home
they
are
an
chorus
but
the
young
man
wallingford
will
serve
them
for
a
text
no
more
his
father
was
a
man
of
parts
of
the
same
type
as
washington
himself
an
i
mistake
not
that
great
leader
though
never
put
to
the
proof
by
so
high
a
summonsing
of
opportunity
our
roger
is
born
out
of
his
father
s
clear
brain
rather
than
his
fiery
heart
i
see
in
him
the
growing
scholarliness
and
quiet
authority
of
the
judge
s
best
days
upon
the
bench
not
the
strong
soldier
of
the
indian
wars
and
there
is
something
in
the
boy
that
holds
by
the
past
he
may
be
a
persuaded
patriot
but
a
tory
ghost
of
a
conscience
plucks
him
by
the
sleeve
he
does
not
lack
greatness
of
soul
but
i
doubt
if
he
does
any
great
things
except
to
stand
honestly
in
his
place
a
scholar
and
a
gentleman
and
that
is
enough
mary
listened
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
master
sullivan
s
face
god
bless
the
poor
lads
every
one
we
must
send
our
prayers
after
them
wallingford
will
fall
upon
evil
days
t
will
try
him
in
blood
and
bone
when
they
suspect
him
as
they
surely
will
god
help
an
old
ruin
like
me
if
i
were
there
and
but
a
younger
man
and
the
master
clenched
the
arms
of
his
chair
while
something
mary
never
had
seen
before
flashed
in
his
eyes
i
have
seen
much
fighting
in
my
time
he
said
the
next
moment
to
mary
falling
to
a
gentler
mood
my
mind
is
often
with
those
lads
on
the
ship
and
the
startled
girl
smiled
back
at
him
expectantly
i
am
glad
when
i
think
that
now
roger
will
see
france
again
as
a
grown
man
he
will
remember
many
things
i
have
told
him
i
wish
that
i
might
have
seen
him
ere
he
went
away
so
suddenly
wherever
he
is
he
has
good
thoughts
in
his
head
he
always
loved
his
latin
and
can
even
stumble
through
the
orchard
ground
and
smell
the
trodden
thyme
with
old
theocritus
i
wish
i
had
been
there
at
your
parting
feast
t
was
a
glory
to
the
house
s
mistress
and
that
merchant
prince
the
good
master
of
the
river
peggy
has
another
opinion
of
me
go
you
an
deck
the
tables
an
it
please
you
child
she
says
an
leave
me
to
give
my
orders
but
we
hold
some
grave
consultations
for
all
that
insisted
mary
modestly
she
is
very
stern
on
feast
days
with
us
all
is
peggy
lenient
in
the
main
urged
master
sullivan
smiling
she
found
convoy
for
a
basket
of
her
best
wares
only
yesterday
with
a
message
that
she
had
cooked
too
much
for
portsmouth
gentlemen
guests
who
failed
in
their
visit
margery
and
i
feasted
in
high
hall
together
there
was
a
grand
bottle
of
claret
my
brother
chose
it
himself
from
the
cellar
said
mary
much
pleased
but
still
there
was
a
look
of
trouble
in
her
eyes
you
will
give
him
my
thanks
and
say
that
it
made
a
young
french
gallant
of
me
for
a
pleasant
hour
the
only
fault
i
found
was
that
i
had
not
its
giver
to
drink
share
and
share
with
me
margery
my
wife
heard
tales
from
me
which
had
not
vexed
the
air
these
fifty
years
and
being
as
warm
as
a
lady
abbess
with
such
good
cheer
she
fell
asleep
in
the
middle
of
the
best
tale
over
her
worsted
knitting
sure
she
waked
to
tell
me
if
these
be
true
t
was
time
you
were
snatched
out
of
france
like
a
brand
from
the
burning
and
got
the
likes
o
poor
me
to
straighten
ye
and
the
old
man
looked
at
mary
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
they
said
you
danced
all
night
with
the
little
captain
and
that
he
spoke
his
love
on
the
terrace
in
the
sight
of
more
than
one
of
the
company
said
the
master
gayly
t
is
another
heart
you
ve
broke
i
suppose
and
sent
him
sad
away
or
was
it
his
uniform
that
won
ye
they
both
laughed
but
mary
blushed
and
wished
she
were
away
herself
i
have
no
right
to
ask
what
passed
between
ye
he
said
then
with
grave
sweetness
that
won
her
back
to
him
i
find
him
a
man
of
great
power
he
has
the
thoughts
and
manners
of
a
gentleman
and
now
he
goes
to
face
his
opportunity
added
the
old
irish
rebel
tis
said
everywhere
that
your
great
captain
is
an
earl
s
son
said
margery
unexpectedly
from
the
fireside
but
master
sullivan
slowly
shook
his
head
the
old
wife
was
impatient
of
contradiction
at
the
best
of
times
and
now
launched
forth
into
an
argument
he
treated
her
in
these
late
days
as
if
she
were
a
princess
but
t
was
a
trying
moment
to
him
now
and
luckily
the
old
volume
of
horace
fell
from
his
lap
to
the
floor
mary
picked
it
up
quickly
and
old
margery
s
withered
cheeks
flushed
crimson
at
this
reminder
of
the
sad
day
when
she
had
thrown
one
of
his
few
dear
books
to
the
flames
in
furious
revenge
for
what
she
thought
his
willful
idleness
and
indifference
to
their
poverty
and
her
children
s
needs
she
always
mourned
in
passionate
remorse
when
anything
reminded
her
of
that
black
day
she
fancied
even
yet
when
she
saw
the
master
stand
before
his
little
bookshelf
that
he
was
missing
the
lost
volume
she
muttered
new
and
was
silent
and
the
old
man
saw
her
lips
moving
and
gave
her
one
of
those
looks
of
touching
affection
that
had
kept
her
for
fifty
years
his
happy
slave
he
is
a
bold
adventurer
your
little
captain
he
went
on
but
a
man
of
very
marked
qualities
i
believe
that
he
will
prove
a
great
captain
said
mary
yes
he
is
all
that
i
have
seen
much
of
men
and
the
master
turned
to
look
out
of
the
window
far
down
the
winter
fields
his
heart
is
set
upon
the
future
of
our
country
said
mary
with
eagerness
he
speaks
with
eloquence
of
our
wrongs
he
agrees
t
is
the
hindering
of
our
own
natural
development
and
the
forbidding
of
our
industries
in
the
past
that
has
brought
all
these
troubles
not
any
present
tyranny
or
special
taxes
as
some
insist
he
speaks
like
a
new
englander
one
of
ourselves
and
he
has
new
ideas
i
heard
him
say
that
every
village
should
govern
itself
and
our
government
be
solely
for
those
necessities
common
to
all
and
this
would
do
away
with
tyranny
he
was
very
angry
when
major
haggens
laughed
and
pounded
the
table
and
said
that
our
villages
must
keep
to
the
same
laws
and
not
vex
one
another
your
captain
has
been
reading
that
new
writer
monsieur
rousseau
said
the
master
sagaciously
and
with
much
interest
rousseau
is
something
of
a
genius
my
son
james
brought
me
his
book
from
boston
and
i
sat
up
all
night
to
read
it
yes
he
is
a
genius
at
his
best
but
at
his
worst
no
greater
fool
ever
sneaked
or
flaunted
along
a
french
road
t
is
like
the
old
donkey
in
skibbereen
that
was
a
lion
by
night
with
his
bold
braying
and
when
the
sun
shone
hung
his
head
and
cried
to
everybody
t
beat
me
i
pray
god
that
no
pupil
of
mine
makes
the
mistake
of
these
people
who
can
see
no
difference
between
the
church
of
their
own
day
and
christianity
itself
my
old
voltaire
has
been
his
master
this
rousseau
there
have
been
few
greater
men
in
the
world
than
le
petit
arouet
but
t
was
a
bit
of
a
rascal
too
my
son
james
and
i
have
threshed
these
subjects
lately
until
the
flails
came
too
near
our
own
heads
i
have
seen
more
of
the
world
than
he
but
my
son
james
always
held
the
opinions
of
a
gentleman
these
subjects
are
far
too
large
for
me
mary
acknowledged
humbly
t
is
only
that
our
opinions
are
too
small
for
the
subjects
mine
and
those
of
my
son
james
said
master
sullivan
smiling
yet
every
man
who
puts
his
whole
heart
into
them
helps
to
bring
the
light
a
little
nearer
your
captain
is
a
good
french
scholar
we
had
some
good
talk
together
and
i
learned
to
honor
the
man
i
hope
he
will
be
friendly
to
our
lad
at
sea
and
be
in
such
a
case
i
have
much
pity
for
the
loyalists
now
i
am
an
old
man
that
was
a
hot
enough
rebel
in
my
youth
they
have
many
true
reasons
on
their
side
for
not
breaking
with
england
and
they
cling
to
sentiment
the
best
of
them
without
which
life
is
but
a
strange
machine
yet
they
have
taken
the
wrong
side
they
will
find
it
out
to
their
sorrow
you
had
much
to
do
with
roger
s
going
my
child
t
was
a
brave
thing
to
start
him
in
the
right
road
but
i
could
wish
he
and
his
mother
had
been
a
sorrowing
pair
of
that
eleven
hundred
who
went
out
of
boston
with
the
english
troops
they
would
have
been
among
their
fellows
then
and
those
who
were
god
help
me
for
this
to
this
moment
had
the
long
talk
come
to
this
anxiety
had
mary
hamilton
herself
led
the
way
she
could
not
part
from
so
wise
a
friend
until
he
spoke
his
mind
and
now
she
stood
piteous
and
dismayed
before
his
searching
look
it
was
not
that
the
old
man
did
not
know
how
hard
his
words
had
been
i
could
not
bear
that
he
should
be
disloyal
to
the
country
that
gave
him
birth
and
every
low
soul
be
given
the
right
to
sneer
at
him
and
the
mob
was
ready
to
burn
his
mother
s
house
the
terror
and
danger
would
have
been
her
death
said
mary
all
this
you
know
the
boy
has
talked
much
with
me
this
summer
answered
the
schoolmaster
and
he
put
me
questions
which
i
a
rebel
and
the
son
of
rebels
against
england
could
not
answer
him
i
am
an
exile
here
with
my
birthright
gone
my
place
among
men
left
empty
because
i
did
not
think
as
he
thinks
now
when
i
was
young
and
yet
i
could
not
answer
him
i
could
as
soon
forsake
my
mother
in
her
gathering
age
as
forsake
england
now
he
told
me
one
day
in
the
summer
he
stood
on
this
floor
before
me
where
you
stand
now
and
looked
every
inch
a
man
now
he
has
changed
his
mind
now
he
puts
to
sea
in
an
american
with
those
to
whom
the
gentle
arts
of
piracy
are
not
unknown
and
he
must
fain
be
of
their
company
who
go
to
make
england
suffer
he
has
done
this
only
that
he
may
win
your
heart
the
master
s
blue
eyes
were
black
and
blazing
with
excitement
and
mary
fronted
him
you
can
not
think
him
a
rascal
she
cried
you
must
believe
that
his
very
nature
has
changed
it
has
changed
and
he
may
fight
with
a
heavy
heart
but
he
has
come
to
think
our
quarrel
just
i
should
break
my
own
heart
did
i
not
think
this
true
has
he
not
sworn
his
oath
then
you
must
not
blame
him
you
must
blame
me
if
all
this
course
was
wrong
i
did
push
him
forward
to
the
step
god
help
me
master
i
could
not
bear
we
should
be
ashamed
of
him
you
do
not
mean
that
t
were
better
he
had
fled
with
the
loyalists
and
thrown
his
duty
down
she
fell
to
her
knees
beside
the
old
man
s
chair
and
her
hot
forehead
was
touching
his
thin
hand
he
laid
his
right
hand
on
her
head
then
as
if
in
blessing
but
he
did
not
speak
at
last
he
made
her
rise
and
they
stood
side
by
side
in
the
room
we
must
not
share
this
anxious
hour
with
margery
he
told
her
gently
go
away
dear
child
while
she
still
sleeps
i
did
not
know
the
sword
of
war
had
struck
your
heart
so
deep
you
must
wait
for
much
time
to
pass
now
you
must
have
patience
and
must
hear
bad
news
they
will
call
roger
wallingford
a
spy
and
he
may
even
flinch
when
the
moment
of
trial
comes
i
do
not
think
he
will
flinch
t
is
the
woe
of
his
own
soul
that
i
sorrow
for
there
is
that
in
him
which
forbids
the
traitor
s
act
yet
either
way
life
looks
to
him
but
treacherous
the
thought
of
his
love
shines
like
a
single
star
above
the
two
roads
and
that
alone
can
succor
him
forgive
the
hardness
of
my
thoughts
yes
and
keep
you
close
to
his
poor
mother
with
all
patience
if
the
boy
gets
into
trouble
i
have
still
some
ancient
friendships
that
will
serve
him
for
my
sake
in
england
god
grant
me
now
to
live
until
the
ship
comes
back
i
trust
the
man
he
sails
with
but
he
has
his
own
ends
to
serve
i
fear
he
is
of
the
the
they
can
run
better
for
what
wings
they
have
but
they
can
not
win
to
fly
clear
of
the
earth
i
could
tell
you
many
a
tale
now
that
i
have
shut
close
in
my
heart
from
every
one
for
more
than
sixty
years
said
master
sullivan
slowly
with
an
impulse
of
love
and
pity
that
he
could
not
forbid
i
was
a
poor
scholar
in
some
things
in
my
young
days
but
i
made
sure
of
one
lesson
that
was
learnt
through
pain
the
best
friends
of
a
human
soul
are
courage
and
her
sister
patience
the
old
man
s
beautiful
voice
had
a
strange
thrill
in
it
he
looked
as
if
he
were
a
king
to
the
girl
who
watched
him
all
the
mystery
of
his
early
days
the
unexplained
and
indifference
to
luxury
seemed
at
this
moment
more
incomprehensible
than
ever
the
dark
little
room
the
unequal
companionship
with
the
wife
who
slept
by
the
fire
the
friendship
of
his
heart
with
a
few
imperial
books
and
the
traditions
of
a
high
ancestry
made
evident
in
the
noble
careers
and
present
standing
of
his
sons
were
enough
to
touch
any
imagination
and
mary
hamilton
from
her
early
childhood
had
found
him
the
best
and
wisest
man
she
knew
he
had
set
the
humblest
berwick
children
their
copies
and
taught
them
to
read
and
spell
and
shared
his
augustine
and
homer
and
horace
with
those
few
who
could
claim
the
right
she
stood
beside
him
now
in
her
day
of
trouble
she
turned
with
a
look
of
deep
love
on
her
face
and
kissed
him
on
the
brow
whatever
the
cause
had
been
he
had
taken
upon
himself
the
harsh
penalty
of
exile
dear
friend
i
must
be
gone
said
mary
with
beautiful
womanliness
and
dignity
you
have
helped
me
again
who
have
never
failed
me
do
not
forget
me
in
these
days
and
let
us
pray
for
roger
wallingford
that
he
may
be
steadfast
dear
master
then
a
minute
later
the
old
man
heard
the
horse
s
quick
feet
go
away
down
the
hill
it
was
twilight
in
the
room
i
believe
she
will
love
the
boy
whispered
the
old
schoolmaster
to
himself
i
thought
the
captain
might
wake
her
heart
with
all
his
gallantry
the
springs
of
love
are
living
in
her
heart
but
t
is
winter
still
t
is
winter
still
love
frights
at
first
more
than
it
can
delight
t
will
fright
my
little
lady
ere
it
comes
the
heavy
book
slipped
unheeded
to
the
floor
again
the
tired
old
woman
slept
on
by
the
dying
fire
and
master
sullivan
was
lost
in
his
lonely
thoughts
until
hope
came
again
to
his
side
bright
shining
in
a
dream
had
i
wist
you
need
not
go
into
a
desert
and
fast
a
crowd
is
often
more
lonely
than
a
wilderness
and
small
things
harder
to
do
than
great
the
ship
had
run
between
belle
isle
and
the
low
curving
shores
of
quiberon
the
land
was
in
sight
all
along
by
nazaire
where
they
could
see
the
of
winter
fields
and
the
dotted
fruit
trees
about
the
farmhouses
and
bits
of
bushy
woodland
out
of
the
waste
of
waters
the
swift
little
ranger
came
heading
safely
in
at
the
mouth
of
the
loire
she
ran
among
all
the
shoals
and
sand
banks
by
paimboeuf
and
past
the
shipyards
of
the
river
shores
until
she
came
to
harbor
and
let
her
anchor
go
there
was
something
homelike
about
being
in
a
river
at
first
sight
the
loire
wore
a
look
of
recent
settlement
rather
than
of
the
approach
to
a
city
already
famous
in
old
roman
times
the
shifting
sand
dunes
and
the
empty
flats
the
poor
scattered
handfuls
of
houses
and
the
works
of
shipbuilding
all
wore
a
temporary
look
these
shiftless
primitive
contrivances
of
men
sparsely
strewed
a
not
too
shore
and
the
newcomers
could
see
little
of
the
inland
country
behind
it
it
was
a
strange
contrast
to
their
own
river
below
portsmouth
where
gray
ledges
ribbed
the
earth
and
bolted
it
down
into
an
unchangeable
permanence
of
outline
the
heights
and
hollows
of
the
seaward
points
of
newcastle
and
the
kittery
shore
stood
plain
before
his
mind
s
eye
as
wallingford
came
on
deck
and
these
strange
banks
of
the
loire
seemed
only
to
mask
reality
and
confuse
his
vision
farther
up
the
stream
they
could
see
the
gray
walls
of
nantes
itself
high
over
the
water
with
the
huge
towered
cathedral
and
the
lesser
bulk
of
the
castle
topping
all
the
roofs
it
was
a
mild
day
with
little
air
moving
dickson
came
along
the
deck
looking
much
displeased
that
morning
he
had
received
the
attention
of
being
kicked
down
the
companion
way
by
the
captain
and
nothing
could
soften
such
an
event
not
even
the
suggestion
from
his
conscience
that
he
had
well
deserved
the
insult
it
seemed
more
and
more
to
those
who
were
nearest
him
as
if
dickson
were
at
heart
the
general
enemy
of
mankind
and
bitter
toward
those
who
stood
above
him
and
scornful
of
his
inferiors
he
loved
to
defeat
the
hopes
of
other
people
to
throw
discredit
upon
sincerity
like
some
thing
that
brings
needless
discomfort
everywhere
and
dismay
and
an
impartial
sting
he
was
not
clever
enough
to
be
a
maker
of
large
schemes
but
rather
destructive
crafty
and
disturber
of
the
plans
of
others
all
this
was
in
his
face
a
fixed
habit
of
smiling
only
added
to
his
mean
appearance
what
was
worst
of
all
being
a
great
maker
of
promises
he
was
not
without
influence
and
had
his
following
the
fresh
air
from
the
land
the
frosty
smell
of
the
fields
made
wallingford
feel
the
more
despondent
the
certainty
had
now
come
to
his
mind
that
paul
jones
would
never
have
consented
to
his
gaining
the
commission
of
lieutenant
would
never
have
brought
him
so
untried
and
untrained
to
sea
but
for
jealousy
and
to
hinder
his
being
at
mary
hamilton
s
side
this
was
the
keenest
hurt
to
his
pride
the
thought
had
stabbed
him
like
a
knife
again
he
made
a
desperate
plunge
into
the
sea
of
his
disasters
and
was
unconscious
even
of
the
man
who
was
near
by
watching
him
he
was
for
the
moment
blind
and
deaf
to
all
reality
as
he
stood
looking
along
the
water
toward
the
breton
town
all
ready
to
go
ashore
sir
asked
dickson
behind
him
in
an
ingratiating
tone
but
wallingford
gave
an
impatient
shrug
of
his
shoulders
t
is
not
so
wintry
here
as
the
shore
must
look
at
home
continued
dickson
damn
that
coxcomb
on
the
he
s
more
than
the
devil
himself
could
stand
for
company
wallingford
instead
of
agreeing
in
his
present
disaffection
turned
about
and
stood
fronting
the
speaker
he
looked
dickson
straight
in
the
eye
as
if
daring
him
to
speak
again
whereat
dickson
remained
silent
the
lieutenant
stood
like
a
prince
i
see
that
i
intrude
said
the
other
rallying
his
you
have
even
less
obligation
to
captain
paul
jones
than
you
may
think
he
continued
dropping
his
voice
and
playing
his
last
trump
i
overheard
by
accident
some
talk
of
his
on
the
terrace
with
a
certain
young
lady
whom
your
high
loftiness
might
not
allow
me
to
mention
he
called
you
a
cursed
young
spy
and
a
tory
and
she
implored
him
to
protect
you
she
said
you
was
her
old
playmate
and
that
she
wanted
you
got
out
o
the
way
o
trouble
he
had
his
arm
round
her
and
he
said
he
might
be
ruined
by
you
he
cursed
you
up
hill
and
down
while
she
was
twas
all
for
her
sake
and
your
mother
s
bein
brought
into
distress
dickson
spoke
rapidly
and
edged
a
step
or
two
away
but
his
shoulder
was
clutched
as
if
a
panther
s
teeth
had
it
instead
of
a
man
s
hand
i
ll
kill
you
if
you
give
me
another
word
said
roger
wallingford
if
i
knew
you
told
the
whole
truth
i
should
be
just
as
ready
to
drop
you
overboard
i
have
told
the
truth
said
dickson
i
know
you
are
n
t
above
eavesdropping
answered
wallingford
with
contempt
if
you
desire
to
know
what
i
think
of
your
sneaking
on
the
outside
of
a
man
s
house
where
you
have
been
denied
entrance
i
am
willing
to
tell
you
i
heard
you
were
there
that
night
you
were
outside
yourself
to
keep
me
company
and
i
m
as
good
a
gentleman
as
jack
hamilton
protested
dickson
he
went
the
rounds
of
the
farms
with
a
shoemaker
s
kit
in
the
start
of
his
high
fortunes
hamilton
would
mend
a
shoe
as
honestly
in
his
young
poverty
as
he
would
sit
in
council
now
so
he
has
come
to
be
a
rich
merchant
and
a
trusted
man
there
was
something
in
wallingford
s
calm
manner
that
had
power
to
fire
even
dickson
s
cold
and
sluggish
blood
i
take
no
insults
from
you
mr
lieutenant
he
exclaimed
in
a
black
rage
and
passed
along
the
deck
to
escape
further
conversation
there
had
been
men
of
the
crew
within
hearing
dickson
had
said
what
he
wished
to
say
and
a
moment
later
he
was
thinking
no
less
highly
of
himself
than
ever
he
would
yet
compass
the
downfall
of
the
two
men
whom
he
hated
he
had
already
set
them
well
on
their
way
to
compass
the
downfall
of
each
other
it
made
a
man
chuckle
with
savage
joy
to
think
of
looking
on
at
the
game
wallingford
went
below
again
and
set
himself
to
some
work
in
his
own
cabin
character
and
the
habit
of
could
carry
a
man
through
many
trying
instances
but
life
now
seemed
in
a
worse
confusion
than
before
this
was
impossible
to
bear
he
brushed
his
papers
to
the
floor
with
a
sweep
of
his
arm
his
heart
was
as
heavy
as
lead
within
him
alas
he
had
seen
the
ring
said
next
moment
to
she
might
do
even
that
if
she
loved
a
man
she
could
think
of
nothing
then
but
that
i
must
be
got
away
to
sea
poor
little
girl
o
god
how
i
love
her
and
he
bent
his
head
sorrowfully
while
an
agony
of
grief
and
dismay
mastered
him
he
had
never
yet
been
put
to
such
awful
misery
of
mind
t
is
my
great
trial
that
has
come
upon
me
he
said
humbly
i
ll
stick
to
my
duty
tis
all
that
i
can
do
heaven
help
me
to
bear
the
rest
thank
god
i
have
my
duty
to
the
ship
artists
have
come
to
study
from
these
marbles
boys
have
flung
stones
against
the
sculptured
and
unmindful
devils
as
soon
as
the
ranger
was
at
nantes
and
the
formalities
of
the
port
could
be
left
in
the
hands
of
his
officers
captain
paul
jones
set
forth
in
haste
toward
paris
to
deliver
his
despatches
he
was
only
sixty
hours
upon
the
road
passing
over
the
country
as
if
he
saw
it
from
a
balloon
and
at
last
had
the
supreme
disappointment
of
finding
that
his
proud
errand
was
forestalled
he
had
driven
himself
and
his
ship
for
nothing
the
news
of
burgoyne
s
surrender
had
been
carried
by
a
messenger
from
boston
on
a
french
vessel
and
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
commissioners
a
few
hours
before
his
own
arrival
it
was
understood
some
time
before
between
the
marine
committee
of
the
colonies
and
captain
paul
jones
that
he
was
to
take
command
of
the
fine
frigate
l
indien
which
was
then
building
in
amsterdam
but
he
received
no
felicitations
now
for
his
rapid
voyage
and
found
no
delightful
accumulations
of
important
work
and
was
by
no
means
acknowledged
as
the
chief
and
captain
of
a
great
enterprise
as
the
ranger
had
come
into
harbor
like
any
ordinary
vessel
from
the
high
seas
unheralded
and
without
greeting
so
paul
jones
now
found
himself
of
no
public
consequence
or
interest
in
paris
what
was
to
be
done
must
all
be
done
by
himself
the
commissioners
had
their
hands
full
of
other
affairs
and
the
captain
stood
in
the
position
of
a
man
who
brought
news
to
deaf
ears
they
listened
to
his
eager
talk
and
plans
with
some
wonder
and
even
a
forced
attention
as
if
he
were
but
an
interruption
and
not
a
leader
for
any
enterprise
they
had
in
hand
to
him
it
had
almost
seemed
as
if
his
great
projects
were
already
accomplished
it
was
in
every
way
a
most
difficult
situation
the
ownership
of
the
indien
frigate
had
been
carefully
concealed
paul
jones
himself
had
furnished
the
plans
for
her
and
the
commissioners
in
france
had
made
contracts
under
other
signatures
for
her
building
in
the
neutral
port
of
amsterdam
it
was
indispensable
that
the
secret
of
her
destiny
should
be
kept
from
england
but
at
the
moment
when
she
was
ready
to
be
put
into
commission
and
paul
jones
was
on
the
sea
with
the
full
expectation
of
finding
his
ship
ready
when
he
came
to
france
some
one
in
the
secret
had
betrayed
it
and
the
british
officials
at
amsterdam
spoke
openly
to
the
government
of
the
netherlands
and
demanded
that
the
frigate
should
be
detained
for
breach
of
neutrality
she
being
destined
for
an
american
ship
of
war
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
the
commissioners
had
made
some
efforts
to
hold
the
frigate
but
in
the
end
france
had
come
forward
and
stood
their
friend
by
buying
her
and
at
a
good
price
this
had
happened
only
a
few
days
before
so
captain
paul
jones
must
hear
the
sorry
tale
when
he
came
to
paris
and
saw
the
three
american
commissioners
he
stood
before
them
a
and
weary
little
hero
with
his
eyes
flashing
fire
one
of
the
three
commissioners
arthur
lee
could
not
meet
his
aggrieved
and
angry
looks
to
be
sure
the
money
was
in
hand
again
and
they
could
buy
another
ship
but
the
indien
the
indien
was
irrecoverable
if
i
had
been
there
gentlemen
cried
paul
jones
with
a
mighty
oath
nothing
would
have
held
me
long
in
port
i
d
have
sailed
her
across
dry
ground
but
i
d
have
got
her
safe
to
sea
she
was
ours
in
the
sight
of
heaven
and
all
the
nations
in
the
world
could
not
prevent
me
franklin
looked
on
with
approval
at
so
noble
and
forgivable
a
rage
the
others
wore
a
wearied
and
disgusted
look
and
arthur
lee
set
himself
to
the
careful
mending
of
a
pen
it
was
a
sorry
hour
for
good
men
and
without
getting
any
definite
promise
and
having
bestowed
many
unavailing
reproaches
at
last
paul
jones
could
only
fling
himself
out
of
paris
again
and
in
black
despair
post
back
to
the
ranger
at
nantes
he
had
the
solitary
comfort
before
he
left
of
a
friendly
and
compassionate
interview
granted
by
franklin
who
though
he
was
and
much
vexed
by
a
younger
man
s
accusations
had
yet
the
largeness
of
mind
to
see
things
from
the
captain
s
side
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
patience
until
affairs
should
take
a
turn
as
the
commissioner
most
patiently
explained
all
the
captain
s
high
hopes
and
ceaseless
industry
in
regard
to
his
own
plans
were
scattered
like
straws
in
the
wind
he
must
set
his
mind
now
to
the
present
possibilities
worst
of
all
he
had
made
an
enemy
in
his
quick
mistrust
and
scorn
of
arthur
lee
a
man
who
would
block
many
another
plan
and
hinder
him
in
the
end
as
a
great
sea
captain
and
hero
had
never
been
worse
hindered
since
the
world
began
dickson
stood
on
the
deck
of
the
ranger
by
the
gangway
when
the
captain
came
aboard
fatigued
and
disappointed
it
might
be
that
some
creature
of
lee
s
sending
had
already
spoken
with
dickson
and
prepared
him
for
what
was
to
come
he
made
a
most
handsome
salutation
however
and
lieutenant
simpson
hoping
for
news
of
his
own
promotion
stepped
forward
with
an
honest
welcome
gentlemen
i
have
much
to
tell
you
and
of
an
unwelcome
sort
said
the
captain
with
unusual
dignity
of
bearing
there
is
one
blessing
our
defeat
of
burgoyne
has
brought
us
france
for
an
ally
i
hoped
for
good
news
as
regards
ourselves
but
we
have
been
betrayed
by
an
enemy
we
have
lost
the
frigate
which
i
have
had
a
hand
in
building
and
of
whose
command
i
was
altogether
certain
for
more
than
a
year
past
we
must
now
wait
for
further
orders
here
and
refit
the
ranger
and
presently
get
to
sea
with
her
instead
i
own
that
it
is
a
great
disappointment
to
us
all
dickson
wore
no
look
of
surprise
he
was
too
full
of
triumph
lieutenant
simpson
was
crestfallen
the
other
officers
and
men
who
were
near
enough
to
hear
looked
angry
and
disturbed
they
had
been
persuaded
that
they
must
be
rid
of
the
captain
before
they
could
follow
their
own
purposes
twas
a
strange
and
piteous
condition
of
things
aboard
the
ranger
and
an
example
of
what
the
poison
of
lies
and
a
jealousy
can
do
to
set
honest
minds
awry
and
paul
jones
had
himself
to
thank
for
much
ill
will
he
had
a
quick
temper
and
a
savage
way
of
speaking
to
his
fellows
the
one
thing
he
could
not
bear
was
perfidy
and
a
bland
and
double
disposition
in
a
man
seemed
at
once
to
deserve
the
tread
of
his
angry
heel
the
captain
was
hardly
to
be
seen
for
a
day
or
two
after
his
return
except
in
occasional
forays
of
wallingford
was
successful
in
keeping
out
of
his
way
the
great
fact
that
all
his
own
best
hopes
had
been
destroyed
dulled
him
even
to
feelings
of
resentment
while
suffering
his
great
dismay
he
could
almost
forget
the
cause
whence
it
came
and
even
pitied
for
other
reasons
the
man
who
had
worn
the
ring
the
first
stroke
of
a
bullet
only
benumbs
the
fierceness
of
pain
comes
later
again
and
again
he
stood
before
mary
hamilton
and
lived
over
the
night
when
he
had
stood
at
the
window
and
dared
to
meet
her
beautiful
angry
eyes
again
and
again
he
reviewed
those
gentler
moments
by
the
river
when
her
eyes
were
full
of
their
old
affection
though
her
words
were
stern
he
had
won
her
plain
promise
that
some
day
having
served
their
country
he
might
return
to
her
side
and
clung
to
that
promise
like
a
last
hope
it
already
seemed
a
year
since
the
night
when
wallingford
and
the
captain
had
dined
together
the
steward
had
interrupted
them
just
as
the
lieutenant
sprung
to
his
feet
must
we
say
then
said
paul
jones
protesting
as
for
me
i
ought
to
be
at
my
papers
send
me
william
earl
to
write
for
me
he
told
the
steward
thank
you
for
your
good
company
wallingford
i
hope
we
may
have
many
such
evenings
together
yet
he
had
looked
after
his
guest
with
a
sense
that
something
had
gone
wrong
at
this
last
moment
though
the
steward
had
found
them
hand
in
hand
the
sight
of
the
ring
among
his
possessions
that
day
when
he
made
ready
for
the
journey
to
paris
had
given
him
a
moment
of
deep
happiness
he
had
placed
it
on
his
finger
with
a
certain
affectionate
vanity
yet
it
was
a
token
of
confidence
and
in
some
sense
a
reward
he
had
been
unjust
in
the
beginning
to
the
young
lieutenant
he
had
now
come
to
like
and
to
trust
him
more
than
any
other
man
on
board
the
ship
in
the
exciting
days
that
had
followed
rings
and
lieutenants
and
even
so
lovely
a
friend
and
lady
as
miss
mary
hamilton
had
been
forgotten
yet
at
most
unexpected
moments
paul
jones
did
remember
her
and
his
heart
longed
for
the
moment
when
they
should
meet
once
more
and
he
might
plead
his
cause
l
absence
diminue
les
petits
amours
et
augmente
les
grandes
comuie
le
vent
qui
éteint
les
bougies
et
rallume
la
feu
the
captain
at
once
began
to
hasten
the
work
of
refitting
the
ranger
for
sea
he
gave
no
explanations
he
was
more
surly
in
temper
and
strangely
uncompanionable
now
that
they
could
no
longer
admire
his
seamanship
in
a
quick
voyage
the
sailors
rated
him
for
the
ship
s
idleness
and
their
long
detention
in
port
this
was
not
what
they
had
signed
for
dickson
now
and
then
let
fall
a
word
which
showed
that
he
had
means
of
information
that
were
altogether
his
own
he
was
often
on
shore
and
seemed
free
with
his
money
lieutenant
wallingford
and
the
surgeon
with
some
of
the
other
officers
became
familiar
with
the
amusements
of
nantes
but
the
lieutenant
was
observed
by
every
one
to
be
downhearted
and
inclined
to
solitary
walks
and
by
night
he
kept
his
cabin
alone
with
no
inclination
toward
company
he
had
been
friendly
with
every
one
in
the
early
part
of
the
voyage
like
a
man
who
has
no
fear
of
risking
a
kind
word
the
surgeon
after
making
unwonted
efforts
to
gain
his
old
neighbor
s
confidence
ignored
him
with
the
rest
until
he
should
come
to
himself
again
this
added
to
the
constraint
and
discomfort
on
board
the
ranger
she
was
crowded
with
men
eager
enough
for
action
and
yet
kept
in
idleness
under
a
needlessly
strict
discipline
simpson
the
senior
lieutenant
willingly
received
the
complaints
of
officers
and
crew
and
dickson
s
ceaseless
insistence
that
simpson
was
their
rightful
leader
began
to
have
its
desired
effect
are
we
friends
again
my
altar
holds
a
constant
flame
some
dreary
days
and
even
weeks
passed
by
and
one
evening
wallingford
passed
the
captain
s
cabin
on
his
way
to
his
own
it
had
lately
been
rough
windy
weather
in
the
harbor
but
that
night
the
ranger
was
on
an
even
keel
and
as
steady
as
if
she
were
a
house
on
shore
the
door
was
open
is
that
you
wallingford
come
in
will
you
the
captain
gave
his
invitation
the
air
of
a
command
wallingford
obeyed
but
stood
reluctant
before
his
superior
i
thought
afterward
that
you
had
gone
off
in
something
of
a
flurry
that
night
we
dined
together
and
you
have
avoided
any
conversation
with
me
since
my
return
from
paris
i
don
t
like
your
looks
now
has
anything
come
between
us
do
you
repent
your
confidence
no
i
do
not
repent
it
said
the
lieutenant
slowly
something
has
touched
your
happiness
come
out
with
it
we
were
like
brothers
then
the
steward
caught
us
hand
in
hand
it
is
long
since
i
have
had
so
happy
an
evening
i
am
grateful
for
such
friendship
as
you
showed
me
when
we
were
together
that
night
god
knows
i
have
felt
the
lack
of
friendship
these
many
days
past
come
sir
what
s
your
grievance
with
me
it
is
nothing
that
i
should
tell
you
you
must
excuse
me
sir
the
captain
looked
at
him
steadily
had
i
some
part
in
it
then
you
are
unjust
not
to
speak
there
was
great
kindness
and
even
solicitude
in
paul
jones
s
tone
wallingford
was
moved
it
was
easier
to
find
fault
with
the
captain
when
his
eyes
were
not
upon
one
they
had
great
power
over
a
man
come
my
dear
fellow
he
said
again
speak
to
me
with
frankness
you
have
no
sincerer
friend
than
i
it
was
the
sight
of
the
ring
on
your
finger
then
i
do
not
think
you
meant
to
taunt
me
but
to
see
it
was
enough
to
rob
me
of
my
hope
sir
that
was
all
the
captain
colored
and
looked
distressed
then
he
covered
his
eyes
with
an
impatient
gesture
he
had
not
a
guilty
air
or
even
an
air
of
provocation
it
struck
wallingford
at
the
moment
that
he
wore
no
look
either
of
triumphant
happiness
such
as
befitted
the
accepted
lover
of
mary
hamilton
you
knew
the
ring
asked
the
captain
looking
up
after
some
moments
of
perplexing
silence
i
have
always
known
it
answered
roger
wallingford
we
were
very
old
friends
of
late
i
had
been
gathering
hope
and
now
sir
it
seems
that
i
must
wish
another
man
the
joy
i
lived
but
to
gain
sit
ye
down
said
the
captain
i
thought
once
that
i
might
gather
hope
too
no
man
could
wish
for
greater
happiness
on
earth
than
the
love
of
such
a
lady
we
are
agreed
to
that
then
he
was
silent
again
the
beauty
of
mary
hamilton
seemed
once
more
before
his
eyes
as
if
the
cabin
and
the
timbers
of
the
ship
were
all
away
and
he
stood
again
on
the
terrace
above
the
river
with
the
pleading
girl
she
had
promised
that
she
would
set
a
star
in
the
sky
for
him
he
should
go
back
one
day
and
lay
his
victories
at
her
feet
how
could
a
man
tell
if
she
really
loved
this
young
wallingford
in
the
natural
jealousy
of
that
last
moment
when
they
were
together
he
had
felt
a
fierce
delight
in
bringing
wallingford
away
she
was
far
too
good
for
him
for
any
man
when
one
came
to
that
yet
he
had
come
himself
to
love
the
boy
if
through
much
suffering
the
captain
had
not
stood
that
day
at
the
very
height
of
his
own
character
with
the
endeavor
to
summon
all
his
powers
for
a
new
effort
the
scale
at
this
moment
would
have
turned
my
dear
lad
she
is
not
mine
he
said
frankly
god
knows
i
wish
it
might
be
otherwise
you
forget
i
am
a
sailor
he
laughed
a
little
and
then
grew
serious
t
is
her
ring
indeed
and
she
gave
it
me
but
t
was
a
gift
of
friendship
see
i
can
kiss
it
on
my
finger
with
you
looking
on
and
pray
god
aloud
to
bless
the
lovely
giver
t
will
hold
me
to
my
best
and
all
the
saints
know
how
i
stand
in
need
of
such
a
talisman
you
do
not
mean
it
sir
faltered
roger
can
you
mean
that
now
are
we
friends
again
yes
i
mean
it
let
us
be
friends
wallingford
no
no
there
need
be
nothing
said
i
own
that
i
have
had
my
hopes
but
miss
hamilton
gave
me
no
promise
if
you
go
home
before
me
or
without
me
as
well
may
happen
you
shall
carry
back
the
ring
ah
no
for
t
is
my
charm
against
despair
he
said
i
am
sore
vexed
i
am
too
often
the
prey
of
my
vulgar
temper
but
god
knows
i
am
sore
vexed
let
us
be
friends
i
must
have
some
honest
man
believe
in
me
among
these
tricksters
the
captain
now
bent
to
his
writing
as
if
he
could
trust
himself
to
say
no
more
and
waved
the
lieutenant
to
be
gone
god
help
me
and
i
ll
win
her
yet
he
cried
next
moment
when
he
was
alone
again
and
lifted
his
face
as
if
heaven
must
listen
to
the
vow
women
like
her
are
blessed
with
wondrous
deep
affections
rather
than
quick
passion
he
said
again
softly
t
is
heaven
itself
within
a
heart
like
that
but
love
is
yet
asleep
the
lights
of
nantes
and
the
lanterns
of
the
shipping
were
all
mirrored
in
the
loire
that
night
there
was
a
soft
noise
of
the
river
current
about
the
ship
the
stars
shone
thick
in
the
sky
they
were
not
looking
down
on
so
happy
a
lover
the
world
over
as
roger
wallingford
he
stood
by
the
mainmast
in
the
cold
night
air
the
sudden
turn
of
things
bewildering
his
brain
his
strong
young
heart
beating
but
unsteadily
alas
it
was
weeks
ago
that
a
single
stiffly
phrased
letter
had
gone
home
to
his
mother
and
mary
s
own
letter
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
there
was
a
swift
brig
just
weighing
anchor
that
had
ventured
to
sea
in
spite
of
foes
and
taken
all
the
letters
from
the
ranger
and
now
it
might
be
weeks
before
he
could
write
again
oh
distance
distance
how
cruel
are
the
long
miles
of
sea
that
separate
those
who
love
and
long
to
be
together
later
that
night
before
they
turned
in
the
officers
and
crew
beheld
captain
paul
jones
and
his
lately
estranged
lieutenant
pacing
the
deck
together
they
were
looked
upon
with
pleasure
by
some
who
honored
them
both
but
next
day
a
new
whispering
was
set
forward
there
was
need
of
suspicion
since
this
new
alliance
might
mean
concerted
betrayal
and
paul
jones
himself
was
not
above
being
won
over
to
the
tories
being
but
an
adventurer
on
his
own
account
dickson
was
as
busy
as
the
devil
in
a
gale
of
wind
his
own
plots
had
so
far
come
to
naught
he
had
not
set
these
officers
to
hate
each
other
or
forced
them
to
compass
each
other
s
downfall
on
the
contrary
they
had
never
really
been
fast
friends
until
now
the
only
thing
was
to
rouse
public
opinion
against
them
both
it
were
easy
enough
he
had
promised
to
meet
again
the
man
whom
he
had
met
in
the
tavern
the
day
before
messenger
of
thornton
who
had
given
hints
of
great
reward
if
any
one
would
give
certain
information
which
was
already
in
dickson
s
keeping
that
night
he
shook
his
fist
at
the
two
figures
that
paced
the
one
of
you
came
out
of
pride
and
ambition
he
muttered
and
the
other
to
please
his
lady
we
men
are
here
for
our
own
rights
and
to
show
that
the
colonies
mean
business
captain
gives
an
but
see
how
they
turn
their
backs
and
go
out
of
the
city
and
how
merrily
and
joyfully
they
take
the
road
to
paris
the
captain
was
dressed
in
his
best
uniform
fresh
from
its
tailor
s
wrappings
with
all
his
bright
lace
and
gilt
buttons
none
the
worse
for
sea
damp
with
manners
gay
enough
to
match
he
bade
to
whoever
appeared
and
paced
his
twelve
steps
forward
and
back
on
the
like
the
lucky
prince
in
a
fairy
story
something
had
happened
to
make
a
new
pleasure
at
any
rate
paul
jones
was
high
above
any
sense
of
displeasure
and
well
content
with
the
warm
satisfaction
of
his
own
thoughts
presently
this
cheerful
captain
sent
a
ship
s
boy
to
command
the
presence
of
wallingford
and
wallingford
came
promptly
in
answer
to
the
summons
there
was
so
evident
a
beginning
of
some
high
official
function
that
the
lieutenant
not
unfamiliar
with
such
affairs
became
certain
that
the
mayor
and
corporation
of
nantes
must
be
expected
to
breakfast
and
lent
himself
not
unwillingly
to
the
play
you
will
attend
me
to
paris
sir
announced
the
commander
i
shall
wait
the
delays
of
our
commissioners
no
longer
if
you
want
a
good
servant
go
yourself
as
our
wise
adviser
poor
richard
has
well
counseled
us
i
mean
to
take
him
at
his
word
can
you
be
ready
within
the
hour
wallingford
t
is
short
notice
for
you
but
i
have
plenty
left
of
my
good
virginia
money
to
serve
us
on
our
way
the
boat
awaits
us
wallingford
made
his
salute
and
hastened
below
his
heart
beat
fast
with
pleasure
being
a
young
heart
and
the
immediate
world
of
france
much
to
its
liking
the
world
of
the
ranger
appeared
to
grow
smaller
day
by
day
and
freedom
is
ever
a
welcome
gift
when
the
lieutenant
reached
his
berth
the
captain
s
arrangements
had
preceded
him
there
was
a
sailor
already
waiting
with
the
leather
portmanteau
which
wallingford
had
brought
to
sea
the
old
judge
his
father
had
carried
it
on
many
an
errand
of
peace
and
justice
and
to
the
son
it
brought
a
quick
reminder
of
home
and
college
journeys
and
a
young
man
s
happy
anticipations
the
sight
of
it
seemed
to
change
everything
stained
though
this
old
enchanter
s
wallet
might
be
with
sea
water
and
its
brasses
green
with
verdigris
the
owner
beheld
it
with
complete
delight
as
for
the
sailor
he
misunderstood
a
sudden
gesture
and
thought
he
was
being
blamed
cap
n
ordered
it
up

demeaned
hisself
to
say
what

mind
was
stretched
to
the
task
of
making
sudden
provision
for
what
might
not
be
a
short
absence
he
could
hear
the
captain
s
impatient
tramp
on
the
deck
overhead

a
careful
voice
and
wallingford
gave
him
a
pat
on
the
shoulder
for
answer
we
ll
speed
matters
by
this
journey
to
paris
if
all
goes
well
he
replied
kindly
keep
the
men
patient
there
are
of
trouble
aboard
that
can
do
the
crew
more
harm
than
the
captain
if
they
get
their
way
you
ll
soon
understand
everything
france
can
not
yet
act
freely
and
we
must
take
long
views
wish
t
i
was
to
home
now
mourned
cooper
gloomily
don
t
fear
cried
wallingford
gayly
though
t
was
but
a
pair
of
days
since
he
himself
had
feared
everything
and
carried
a
glum
face
for
all
the
crew
to
see
cooper
if
anything
should
happen
to
me
you
must
carry
back
word
he
added
with
boyish
bravado
lord
bless
you
said
cooper
i
figur
me
darin
to
go
nigh
the
gre
t
house
with
any

take
an
scalp
me
s
if
i
d
been
the
fust
to
blame
at
which
they
laughed
together
and
hurried
to
the
deck
t
is
high
time
blustered
the
captain
but
once
in
the
boat
he
became
and
companionable
it
was
as
if
they
had
both
left
all
their
troubles
behind
them
there
s
simpson
and
sargent
and
that
dickson
leaning
over
the
side
to
look
after
us
and
think
how
well
they
can
spare
us
both
grumbled
paul
jones
i
can
see
them
there
whether
i
turn
my
head
or
not
i
ve
set
them
stints
enough
for
a
fortnight
and
named
this
day
week
for
our
return
lay
out
lay
out
cried
the
captain
give
way
my
lads
and
settled
himself
in
the
boat
the
wind
was
fresh
the
waves
splashed
into
the
gig
as
they
toiled
steadily
up
the
river
the
walls
of
the
old
castle
looked
grim
and
high
as
they
came
under
the
city
in
the
cathedral
abode
the
one
thing
that
was
dear
to
wallingford
s
heart
in
this
strange
place
stately
figure
of
anne
of
brittany
standing
at
her
mother
s
feet
by
the
great
renaissance
tomb
she
wore
a
look
like
mary
hamilton
when
she
was
most
serious
so
calm
and
sweet
across
the
brow
the
young
officer
had
discovered
this
lovely
queen
and
her
still
lovelier
likeness
on
a
dark
and
downcast
day
and
had
often
been
grateful
since
for
the
pleasure
of
beholding
her
he
now
sent
a
quick
thought
into
the
cathedral
from
the
depths
of
his
fond
heart
the
two
travelers
in
their
bright
uniforms
hurried
up
through
the
busy
town
to
a
large
inn
where
the
captain
had
ordered
his
post
horses
to
be
ready
bretons
and
frenchmen
both
cheered
them
as
they
passed
the
market
place
the
errand
of
the
ranger
was
well
known
and
much
had
made
most
of
her
ship
s
company
plenty
of
friends
ashore
they
took
their
seats
in
the
post
chaise
not
without
disappointment
on
wallingford
s
part
who
had
counted
upon
riding
a
good
french
horse
to
paris
instead
of
jolting
upon
stiff
springs
there
was
more
than
one
day
however
the
morning
was
fresh
and
bright
and
there
were
too
many
mercies
beside
to
let
a
man
groan
over
anything
the
thought
now
struck
wallingford
as
if
he
were
by
far
the
elder
man
that
they
might
well
have
worn
their
clothes
upon
the
journey
but
he
had
not
the
heart
to
speak
the
captain
wore
such
an
innocent
look
of
enjoyment
and
of
frankly
accepting
the
part
of
a
proven
hero
and
unprotested
great
man
i
must
order
a
couple
of
suits
of
new
uniform
from
one
of
their
best
tailors
said
paul
jones
only
half
conscious
of
his
listener
one
moment
the
hardened
man
of
affairs
and
rough
sea
bully
at
the
next
one
saw
him
thus
frank
compassionate
of
others
and
amused
by
small
pleasures
sentimental
philosopher
who
scattered
largess
of
alms
like
a
royal
prince
all
along
the
white
french
roads
i
go
north
by
rennes
and
vitré
and
to
paris
by
alençon
i
am
told
the
roads
are
good
and
the
worst
inns
passable
while
the
best
are
the
best
said
the
little
captain
dropping
the
last
of
his
lofty
manner
of
the
and
turning
to
his
companion
with
a
most
frank
air
of
we
can
return
by
the
loire
i
hear
that
we
can
come
by
barge
from
orleans
to
nantes
in
four
days
lying
in
the
river
inns
by
night
i
have
no
love
for
the
road
i
was
so
sorry
on
last
month
or
the
inns
that
stood
beside
it
the
young
men
sat
and
a
little
pompous
in
the
post
chaise
with
their
best
cocked
hats
bobbing
and
turning
quickly
toward
each
other
in
the
pleasures
of
conversation
was
this
the
same
paul
jones
who
so
vexed
his
ship
with
bawling
voice
and
harsh
behavior
this
quiet
man
of
the
world
who
seemed
to
play
the
princely
traveler
even
more
easily
than
he
crowded
sail
on
the
ranger
all
across
the
stormy
seas
flail
of
whose
speech
left
nobody
untouched
he
was
so
delightful
at
that
moment
so
full
of
charming
sympathy
and
keenest
observation
that
all
private
grievances
must
have
been
dissolved
into
the
sweet
french
air
and
the
blue
heaven
over
their
heads
there
were
others
of
my
officers
who
might
well
go
to
paris
but
i
wanted
the
right
gentleman
with
me
now
explained
the
captain
with
frankness
t
is
above
all
a
gentleman
s
place
when
court
matters
are
in
hand
you
have
some
acquaintance
with
their
language
too
which
is
vastly
important
i
blessed
heaven
last
time
for
every
word
i
knew
t
was
most
of
it
hard
learnt
in
my
early
days
when
i
was
a
sailor
before
the
mast
and
had
but
a
single
poor
book
to
help
me
no
man
can
go
much
in
the
world
over
here
without
his
french
and
you
know
paris
too
wallingford
while
i
am
almost
a
stranger
in
the
streets
i
cared
not
where
i
was
in
my
late
distresses
though
i
had
longed
to
see
the
sights
of
paris
all
my
life
my
whole
heart
is
in
the
journey
now
tiresome
though
we
may
find
many
a
day
s
long
leagues
t
is
some
years
since
i
lived
there
for
a
month
said
wallingford
modestly
but
a
vision
of
all
the
pleasure
and
splendor
of
the
great
city
rose
to
his
mind
s
eye
i
have
suffered
unbelievable
torture
on
that
petty
ship
exclaimed
paul
jones
suddenly
waving
his
hand
toward
the
harbor
they
were
fast
leaving
out
of
sight
now
for
the
green
fields
of
france
and
for
the
high
commissioners
at
paris
i
wish
to
god
my
old
auntie
jean
macduff
that
was
fain
to
be
prood
o
me
could
see
me
with
my
two
postilions
on
the
road
this
day
and
such
was
the
gayety
of
the
moment
and
the
boyish
pride
of
the
little
sailor
that
his
companion
fairly
loved
him
for
the
wish
and
began
to
think
tenderly
of
his
own
dear
love
and
of
his
mother
waiting
and
watching
by
the
riverside
at
home
vitré
he
repeated
presently
with
fresh
expectation
t
is
a
name
i
know
well
but
i
can
not
call
to
mind
the
associations
of
the
town
of
rennes
i
do
not
remember
to
have
heard
i
wish
that
i
could
have
fallen
in
with
their
great
admiral
bailli
suffren
said
the
captain
leaning
back
in
the
post
chaise
and
heaving
a
sigh
of
perfect
content
we
know
not
where
he
sails
the
sea
but
if
it
chanced
that
he
were
now
on
his
way
to
the
fleet
at
brest
or
going
up
to
paris
from
the
sea
like
ourselves
and
we
chanced
to
meet
at
an
inn
how
i
should
beg
the
honor
of
his
acquaintance
the
king
ought
to
put
a
sailor
like
that
beside
him
on
his
throne
as
for
bailli
suffren
he
has
served
france
as
well
as
any
man
who
ever
lived
look
there
are
two
poor
sailors
of
another
sort
fresh
from
their
vessel
too
see
how
wide
they
tread
from
balancing
on
the
decks
they
have
been
long
at
sea
poor
devils
he
grumbled
as
the
post
chaise
overtook
a
forlorn
pair
of
seamen
each
carrying
a
loose
bundle
on
his
back
they
were
still
young
men
but
their
faces
looked
disappointed
and
sad
seeing
that
the
captain
fumbled
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
wallingford
did
the
same
and
two
bright
louis
d
or
flew
through
the
morning
air
and
dropped
at
the
sailors
feet
they
gave
a
shout
of
joy
and
the
two
young
lords
in
the
post
chaise
passed
gayly
on
they
ll
sit
long
at
the
next
inn
said
captain
paul
jones
they
were
thin
as
those
salt
fish
we
shipped
for
the
voyage
at
newcastle
a
prime
dun
fish
is
a
dainty
not
to
be
despised
urged
wallingford
true
to
his
local
traditions
t
is
either
a
dainty
or
a
cedar
shingle
well
preserved
in
brine
which
is
eatable
by
no
man
pronounced
the
captain
speaking
with
the
authority
of
an
epicure
we
must
now
deal
with
their
best
french
dishes
while
we
stay
in
paris
franklin
will
no
doubt
advise
us
in
regard
to
their
best
inns
i
was
careless
of
the
matter
in
my
first
visit
t
was
poor
richard
himself
said
a
fat
kitchen
makes
a
lean
will
laughed
wallingford
but
he
is
a
great
man
for
the
proprieties
great
the
philosopher
showeth
you
the
way
the
heads
of
the
high
vitré
houses
nodded
together
above
their
narrow
streets
as
if
to
gossip
about
two
unexpected
cocked
hats
that
passed
below
this
uniform
of
the
continental
navy
was
new
enough
but
old
vitré
had
seen
many
new
and
strange
things
since
she
herself
was
young
the
two
officers
had
an
air
of
proud
command
about
them
and
seemed
to
expect
the
best
rooms
at
the
inn
and
the
best
wines
t
was
here
the
famous
marchioness
de
sévigné
dwelt
exclaimed
wallingford
with
triumph
my
mother
often
read
a
book
of
her
letters
to
my
father
on
a
winter
evening
i
thought
them
dull
then
but
i
know
now
t
was
most
pretty
reading
with
something
of
fresh
charm
on
every
page
she
had
her
castle
here
at
vitré
she
was
a
very
great
lady
continued
the
lieutenant
explaining
modestly
she
spoke
much
in
her
letters
about
her
orange
trees
but
i
think
that
she
was
ill
at
ease
so
far
from
paris
we
could
visit
her
if
she
were
still
in
vitré
said
the
captain
t
would
pass
our
time
most
pleasantly
i
dare
say
but
i
take
it
the
poor
lady
is
dead
since
we
have
her
memoirs
yes
i
mind
me
of
the
letters
too
i
saw
them
in
a
handsome
binding
once
at
arbigland
when
i
was
a
lad
the
laird
s
lady
craik
read
the
language
she
had
been
much
in
france
like
many
of
our
scottish
gentlefolk
perhaps
t
was
her
very
castle
that
we
observed
as
we
came
near
the
town
with
the
quaint
round
tower
that
stood
apart
t
was
the
chapel
of
madame
said
the
old
french
serving
man
on
a
sudden
and
in
good
english
messieurs
will
pardon
me
but
my
grandfather
was
long
ago
one
of
her
head
foresters
the
gentlemen
turned
and
received
this
information
with
a
politeness
equal
to
that
with
which
it
was
given
t
is
a
fine
country
france
said
the
little
captain
handsomely
let
us
fill
our
glasses
again
to
the
glory
of
france
and
the
success
of
our
expedition
then
let
us
drink
to
old
england
too
wallingford
and
that
she
may
be
brought
to
reason
he
added
unexpectedly
when
they
had
drunk
the
first
toast
there
is
no
such
as
england
and
as
for
her
sailors
they
are
the
northmen
of
old
born
again
for
the
glory
of
a
later
time
the
next
day
but
two
they
came
into
the
gate
of
paris
and
saw
the
dark
prison
of
the
bastille
the
tour
jacques
and
the
great
cathedral
of
notre
dame
it
was
late
afternoon
and
paris
looked
like
a
greater
vitré
but
with
higher
houses
that
also
nodded
together
and
a
busier
world
of
shops
and
palaces
and
churches
wallingford
returned
with
older
eyes
to
see
much
that
had
escaped
him
as
a
boy
and
to
captain
paul
jones
there
was
a
noble
assurance
in
finding
the
capital
city
of
his
adopted
country
s
allies
so
rich
and
splendid
above
all
so
frankly
gay
there
was
none
of
the
prim
discretion
of
those
english
and
scottish
towns
with
which
he
was
most
familiar
paris
was
in
her
prime
and
was
wholly
independent
of
trifles
like
a
fine
lady
who
admitted
these
two
admiring
strangers
to
the
hospitality
of
her
house
with
the
unconcern
of
one
whose
dwelling
was
well
furnished
and
well
served
the
old
french
kings
had
gone
away
one
by
one
and
left
their
palaces
behind
them
long
façades
of
the
louvre
and
the
pleasant
courts
of
the
palais
royal
and
many
another
noble
pile
here
in
paris
benjamin
franklin
the
bon
homme
richard
was
bearing
his
difficult
honors
as
first
citizen
of
a
new
republic
and
living
on
good
terms
with
the
best
gentlemen
of
france
his
house
which
he
had
from
monsieur
le
ray
de
chaumont
was
at
the
other
end
of
paris
at
passy
a
village
beyond
the
suburbs
of
the
great
town
and
next
morning
the
young
men
well
mounted
rode
thither
with
a
groom
behind
them
and
alighted
at
the
commissioner
s
door
benjamin
franklin
was
in
the
midst
of
his
morning
affairs
he
was
dressed
in
a
suit
of
velvet
with
white
stockings
and
had
laid
his
white
hat
beside
him
on
a
table
which
was
covered
with
papers
and
a
few
books
it
was
a
tuesday
and
he
had
been
to
court
with
the
rest
of
the
diplomats
having
lately
been
presented
with
the
two
american
commissioners
his
fellows
to
his
majesty
the
king
he
rose
with
a
courteous
air
of
welcome
as
the
young
men
entered
and
looked
sharply
at
them
and
then
at
their
uniforms
with
much
indulgent
interest
you
are
the
representatives
of
our
navy
t
is
a
very
dignified
dress
i
am
glad
to
see
it
to
receive
its
wearers
he
added
smiling
while
the
officers
bowed
again
gravely
i
was
in
a
poor
enough
undress
at
my
first
visit
and
fresh
from
travel
in
the
worst
of
weather
said
paul
jones
lowering
his
voice
at
the
sad
remembrance
mr
wallingford
and
the
old
commissioner
turned
quickly
toward
the
younger
guest
i
remember
you
as
a
lad
in
portsmouth
as
for
my
good
friend
your
honored
father
he
will
be
unforgettable
to
those
who
knew
him
you
begin
to
wear
his
looks
they
will
increase
i
think
as
you
gather
age
sit
ye
down
gentlemen
sit
ye
down
and
he
waved
them
to
two
straight
chairs
which
stood
side
by
side
at
some
distance
down
the
room
in
the
french
fashion
then
he
seated
himself
again
behind
his
table
and
gave
audience
captain
paul
jones
was
occupied
for
a
moment
in
placing
his
heavy
sword
wallingford
was
still
looking
eagerly
toward
their
host
you
are
very
good
to
remember
me
sir
he
said
i
counted
it
a
great
honor
that
my
father
let
me
attend
him
that
day
at
warner
s
dinner
you
will
be
pleased
to
know
that
the
lightning
conductors
are
still
in
place
on
the
house
and
are
much
shown
to
strangers
in
these
days
as
being
of
your
planning
the
philosopher
smiled
at
his
young
friend
s
warmth
there
was
something
most
homely
and
amiable
mingled
with
his
great
dignity
and
my
friend
john
langdon
i
have
deeply
considered
our
dispatches
from
him
and
especially
the
letter
from
robert
morris
which
agrees
in
the
main
with
your
own
ideas
sir
and
he
bowed
to
captain
paul
jones
and
my
friend
langdon
he
repeated
looking
for
his
answer
to
the
lieutenant
langdon
was
very
well
sir
though
much
wearied
with
his
cares
and
sent
his
best
remembrances
and
respects
in
case
i
should
be
so
honored
as
to
see
you
and
also
nicholas
gilman
of
exeter
who
was
with
him
beside
many
portsmouth
gentlemen
your
old
friends
our
men
at
home
carry
the
heaviest
burdens
said
franklin
sighing
yet
i
wish
every
day
that
i
might
be
at
home
as
they
are
my
first
lieutenant
simpson
is
the
of
major
langdon
said
captain
paul
jones
flushing
like
a
boy
as
he
spoke
he
could
not
help
a
somewhat
uncomfortable
sense
of
being
on
the
of
a
commander
much
greater
than
himself
and
an
uncertain
feeling
about
their
relations
that
tried
him
very
much
but
he
wore
a
manly
look
and
kept
to
his
quietest
manners
he
had
parted
from
the
commissioner
at
their
last
interview
in
deep
distress
and
a
high
passion
you
have
found
lieutenant
simpson
an
excellent
officer
no
doubt
with
the
large
experience
of
a
portsmouth
shipmaster
observed
franklin
blandly
he
cast
a
shrewd
look
at
the
captain
but
while
his
firm
mouth
set
itself
a
little
more
firmly
there
was
a
humorous
gleam
of
half
inquiry
half
indulgence
in
his
eyes
you
have
spoken
him
sir
acknowledged
captain
paul
jones
while
with
equal
and
a
touch
of
deference
he
waited
for
the
commissioner
to
lead
the
conversation
further
and
thereby
did
not
displease
franklin
who
had
feared
an
interview
of
angry
accusation
and
indignant
resentment
wallingford
too
was
conscious
of
great
pleasure
in
his
captain
s
bearing
there
was
a
pause
and
franklin
looked
again
at
the
captain
and
bowed
slightly
from
his
chair
you
may
say
what
you
have
come
to
say
to
me
captain
paul
jones
you
can
no
doubt
trust
wallingford
you
see
that
i
have
for
the
moment
dismissed
my
secretary
i
can
trust
wallingford
answered
the
captain
holding
himself
steady
but
rising
from
the
chair
unconsciously
and
taking
a
step
nearer
to
the
table
his
new
cocked
hat
was
crushed
under
his
arm
and
wallingford
could
see
that
the
whole
figure
of
the
man
was
in
a
nervous
quiver
i
can
trust
wallingford
he
repeated
sternly
but
i
am
sorry
that
i
can
not
say
the
same
of
lieutenant
simpson
i
have
suffered
too
much
already
at
his
hands
through
his
endeavors
to
supplant
me
as
commander
of
the
ranger
he
has
descended
to
the
poor
means
of
disputing
my
authority
before
my
crew
and
stimulating
them
in
their
rebellion
and
surly
feelings
a
crew
is
easily
prejudiced
against
its
superiors
you
must
be
well
aware
sir
how
difficult
a
proper
government
may
become
at
sea
t
is
a
hard
life
at
best
for
crew
or
captain
and
its
only
safety
is
in
wise
control
and
decent
obedience
do
you
desire
to
make
formal
complaint
of
your
lieutenant
it
is
hardly
my
province
said
the
commissioner
the
amused
look
had
left
his
eyes
and
they
were
as
firm
now
as
if
he
were
a
great
judge
on
the
bench
i
respect
your
anxieties
he
added
next
moment
when
he
saw
that
he
held
the
captain
in
check
i
am
not
unaware
of
your
high
aims
your
great
disappointment
or
your
most
difficult
conditions
of
the
present
but
these
conditions
and
the
varieties
of
human
nature
among
so
large
a
ship
s
company
were
not
unknown
to
you
the
uncongenial
man
and
the
unwilling
assistant
must
always
be
borne
with
patience
among
our
fellows
besides
we
pardon
anything
to
those
we
love
and
forgive
nothing
to
those
we
hate
you
may
go
on
sir
the
trouble
has
come
in
great
measure
from
an
open
understanding
long
before
we
set
sail
out
of
portsmouth
that
i
was
to
be
given
another
frigate
immediately
upon
my
arrival
and
that
simpson
was
to
take
command
of
the
ranger
in
my
stead
said
paul
jones
now
that
all
is
over
in
regard
to
the
indien
he
can
fret
under
the
long
delay
no
worse
than
i
but
shows
his
impatience
of
my
orders
at
times
and
seasons
when
it
ill
befits
him
and
most
wrongs
and
debases
me
he
behaves
on
the
slightest
provocation
as
if
i
had
deeply
injured
him
and
gives
no
reason
why
he
is
my
senior
in
age
which
has
added
much
to
the
difficulty
between
us
he
loses
no
chance
to
hint
that
i
am
bent
on
selfish
ends
even
i
believe
that
my
principles
my
character
may
be
questioned
in
this
matter
my
crew
have
become
sensitive
to
the
fear
that
i
can
not
be
trusted
owing
to
my
scottish
birth
and
early
life
spent
upon
british
vessels
if
they
were
any
of
them
of
a
very
different
blood
and
descent
there
is
a
worse
man
on
board
than
simpson
a
man
named
dickson
who
to
further
his
own
ends
furthers
the
lieutenant
s
he
has
insisted
from
the
first
that
wallingford
is
a
tory
spy
and
that
the
ranger
should
be
in
the
hands
of
those
who
could
fill
their
pockets
with
prize
money
he
and
perhaps
simpson
himself
bewail
their
disappointment
at
discovering
that
a
is
not
the
same
as
a
privateer
their
ignorance
of
statecraft
and
the
laws
of
naval
science
and
duty
seems
to
make
them
smile
with
derision
at
all
proper
discipline
as
if
at
some
pompous
horseplay
the
captain
s
face
was
red
now
and
his
voice
sharpening
to
undue
loudness
but
at
an
anxious
gesture
from
wallingford
he
grew
quiet
again
i
come
to
ask
you
commissioner
if
by
any
means
i
can
further
this
business
and
hasten
my
transfer
to
another
ship
but
i
must
first
do
what
i
can
with
the
ranger
she
is
unfit
for
any
great
action
but
we
can
make
a
pretty
showing
in
small
matters
my
head
is
full
of
ideas
which
i
should
be
glad
to
lay
before
you
i
desire
to
strike
a
smart
blow
at
the
english
coast
to
counteract
the
burnings
of
our
towns
at
home
and
the
interference
with
our
shipping
and
to
stop
the
prisoning
of
our
sailors
i
can
light
a
fire
in
england
that
will
show
them
we
are
a
people
to
be
feared
and
not
teased
and
laughed
at
i
ask
you
now
how
far
france
is
ready
to
help
me
we
have
good
friends
in
england
still
said
the
commissioner
slowly
some
of
the
best
minds
and
best
characters
among
englishmen
see
our
question
of
the
colonies
with
perfect
fairness
the
common
people
are
in
great
part
for
us
too
and
i
have
not
yet
lost
hope
that
they
may
win
the
day
but
of
late
things
have
gone
almost
too
far
for
hope
wallingford
and
he
turned
abruptly
toward
the
lieutenant
i
must
not
forget
to
ask
you
for
your
mother
s
health
i
have
thought
of
her
many
times
in
her
widowhood
she
would
ill
bear
the
saddest
loss
that
can
fall
upon
any
of
us
but
she
would
bear
it
nobly
the
captain
felt
himself
silenced
in
the
very
gathering
and
uplift
of
his
eloquence
when
he
was
only
delayed
out
of
kind
consideration
roger
wallingford
answered
the
kind
old
man
briefly
and
with
deep
feeling
then
the
conference
went
on
the
captain
was
in
full
force
of
his
honest
determination
since
i
can
not
have
the
indien
as
we
well
know
what
ship
can
i
have
he
demanded
shall
i
do
what
i
can
with
the
ranger
t
were
far
better
than
such
idleness
as
this
when
i
have
seen
my
friend
the
duke
of
chartres
again
things
may
take
a
turn
he
can
do
much
for
you
answered
franklin
i
have
been
told
that
he
speaks
of
you
everywhere
with
respect
and
affection
these
things
count
like
solid
gold
with
the
indifferent
populace
ready
to
take
either
side
of
a
great
question
i
feel
sure
sir
that
the
blow
must
be
struck
quickly
if
at
all
urged
the
captain
if
nothing
is
to
be
expected
from
france
i
must
do
the
best
i
can
with
the
means
in
my
hand
i
must
make
some
use
of
the
ranger
we
have
already
lost
far
too
much
time
they
hampered
and
delayed
me
in
portsmouth
for
month
upon
month
when
i
might
have
been
effective
here
when
you
are
as
old
as
i
captain
paul
jones
you
will
have
learned
that
delays
appear
sometimes
to
be
the
work
of
those
who
are
wiser
than
we
if
life
has
anything
to
teach
us
it
is
patience
but
patience
is
the
hardest
thing
to
teach
those
men
who
have
the
makings
of
a
hero
in
their
breasts
and
again
he
fell
into
expectant
silence
and
sat
behind
his
table
looking
straight
at
the
captain
wallingford
s
heart
was
touched
by
a
recognition
of
paul
jones
s
character
which
had
been
so
simply
spoken
but
that
man
of
power
and
action
took
no
notice
himself
except
to
put
on
a
still
more
eager
look
and
shift
his
footing
as
he
stood
doing
honor
from
his
heart
to
franklin
will
you
not
sit
captain
we
have
much
talk
before
us
it
astonishes
me
that
you
should
have
gained
so
warm
a
love
for
your
adopted
country
said
the
commissioner
i
have
to
confess
that
england
has
been
to
me
but
a
cruel
stepmother
i
loved
her
and
tried
to
serve
her
boy
and
man
answered
the
other
when
i
went
to
live
in
virginia
i
learned
to
love
my
new
country
as
a
lover
loves
his
mistress
god
forgive
me
if
i
have
sometimes
been
rash
in
my
service
but
glory
has
always
shone
like
a
star
in
my
sky
and
in
america
a
man
is
sure
of
a
future
if
it
is
in
his
own
breast
to
make
one
at
home
everything
is
fixed
there
are
walls
that
none
but
the
very
greatest
have
ever
climbed
glory
is
all
my
dream
there
is
no
holding
back
in
me
when
i
think
of
it
my
poor
goods
and
my
poor
life
are
only
for
it
help
me
sir
help
me
to
get
my
opportunity
you
shall
see
that
i
am
at
heart
a
true
american
and
that
i
know
my
business
as
a
sailor
do
not
join
with
those
who
with
petty
quibbles
and
excuses
would
hold
me
back
the
passion
of
paul
jones
the
fire
and
manly
beauty
in
his
face
his
look
of
high
spirit
would
have
moved
two
duller
hearts
than
belonged
to
his
listeners
franklin
still
sat
there
with
his
calm
old
face
and
a
look
of
pleasant
acceptance
in
his
eyes
yes
you
are
willing
to
go
forward
the
feet
of
young
men
are
ever
set
toward
danger
he
said
i
repeat
that
we
must
sometimes
be
heroes
at
waiting
to
your
faith
you
must
add
patience
your
life
of
effort
like
mine
must
teach
you
that
but
i
have
had
longer
to
learn
the
lesson
i
shall
do
all
that
i
can
for
you
i
respect
your
present
difficulties
but
we
have
to
live
in
the
world
as
it
is
we
can
not
refashion
the
world
our
task
is
with
ourselves
quel
plaisir
said
the
little
captain
bitterly
under
his
breath
the
pleasant
french
room
with
its
long
windows
set
open
to
the
formal
garden
was
so
silent
for
a
time
that
at
last
all
three
of
the
men
were
startled
by
a
footstep
coming
out
of
the
distance
toward
them
along
the
loose
pebbles
of
the
garden
walk
they
could
not
help
the
feeling
that
a
messenger
was
coming
from
the
world
outside
but
as
the
sound
approached
the
window
they
recognized
the
easy
clack
of
a
pair
of
wooden
shoes
and
the
young
gardener
who
wore
them
began
to
sing
a
gay
little
french
song
captain
paul
jones
moved
impatiently
but
franklin
had
taken
the
time
for
thought
my
friend
david
hartley
a
member
of
parliament
who
has
been
my
willing
agent
in
what
attempts
could
be
made
to
succor
our
prisoned
sailors
begs
me
to
have
patience
he
said
reflectively
he
still
thinks
that
nothing
should
persuade
america
to
throw
herself
into
the
arms
of
france
for
times
are
sure
to
mend
and
an
american
must
always
be
a
stranger
in
france
while
great
britain
will
be
our
natural
home
for
ages
to
come
but
i
recalled
to
him
in
my
answer
the
fact
that
his
nation
is
hiring
all
the
cutthroats
it
can
collect
of
all
countries
and
colors
to
destroy
us
it
would
be
hard
to
persuade
us
not
to
ask
or
accept
aid
from
any
power
that
may
be
prevailed
with
to
grant
it
for
the
reason
that
though
we
are
now
put
to
the
sword
we
may
at
some
future
time
be
treated
kindly
this
expects
too
much
patience
of
us
altogether
he
continued
americans
have
been
treated
with
cordiality
and
affectionate
respect
here
in
france
as
they
have
not
been
in
england
when
they
most
deserved
it
now
that
the
english
are
exasperated
against
us
we
have
become
odious
as
well
as
contemptible
and
we
can
not
expect
a
better
treatment
for
a
long
time
to
come
i
do
not
see
why
we
may
not
upon
an
alliance
hope
for
a
steady
friendship
with
france
she
has
been
faithful
to
little
switzerland
these
two
hundred
years
i
can
not
find
it
in
my
heart
to
think
that
our
friendship
with
our
mother
country
is
forever
broken
urged
wallingford
speaking
with
anxious
solicitude
the
bond
is
too
close
between
us
it
is
like
the
troubles
that
break
the
happiness
of
a
family
in
a
day
of
bad
weather
it
is
but
a
quarrel
or
fit
of
the
sulks
and
when
past
the
love
that
is
born
in
our
hearts
must
still
hold
us
together
you
speak
truly
my
young
friend
said
the
old
commissioner
but
we
have
to
remember
that
the
lives
of
nations
are
of
larger
scope
and
that
the
processes
of
change
are
of
long
duration
i
think
that
it
may
be
a
century
before
the
old
sense
of
dependence
and
affection
can
return
and
england
and
america
again
put
their
arms
about
each
other
paul
jones
fretted
in
his
gilded
chair
the
carved
crest
of
monsieur
de
chaumont
was
sharp
against
his
back
and
the
conversation
was
becoming
much
too
general
our
country
is
like
a
boy
hardly
come
to
manhood
yet
who
is
at
every
moment
afraid
that
he
will
not
be
taken
for
a
man
of
forty
years
said
franklin
smiling
we
have
all
the
faults
of
youth
but
thank
god
the
faults
of
a
young
country
are
better
than
the
faults
of
an
old
one
it
is
the
young
heart
that
takes
the
forward
step
the
day
comes
when
england
will
love
us
all
the
better
for
what
we
are
doing
but
it
provokes
the
mother
country
now
and
grieves
the
child
if
i
read
their
hearts
aright
there
have
been
those
who
thought
the
mother
most
deeply
hurt
and
the
child
most
angry
you
will
have
seen
much
of
the
loyalists
wallingford
if
i
mistake
not
wallingford
colored
with
boyish
confusion
it
would
seem
most
natural
sir
if
you
take
my
mother
s
connection
into
account
he
answered
honestly
she
and
her
family
are
among
those
who
have
been
sure
of
england
s
distress
at
our
behavior
she
is
of
those
who
inherit
the
deepest
sentiments
of
affection
toward
the
crown
and
you
have
been
her
antagonist
the
question
was
kindly
put
but
it
came
straight
as
an
arrow
and
with
such
force
that
paul
jones
forgot
his
own
burning
anxiety
for
the
french
frigate
and
turned
to
hear
wallingford
s
answer
all
his
natural
jealousy
of
a
rival
in
love
and
suspicion
of
a
man
who
had
openly
confessed
himself
a
conservative
were
again
roused
i
have
taken
oath
and
i
wear
the
uniform
of
our
american
navy
sir
replied
wallingford
quietly
my
father
taught
me
that
a
gentleman
should
stand
by
his
word
i
was
not
among
those
who
wished
to
hasten
so
sad
a
war
and
i
believe
that
our
victory
must
be
the
long
defeat
of
our
prosperity
but
since
there
is
war
and
we
have
become
independent
my
country
has
a
right
to
claim
my
service
the
captain
knows
the
circumstances
which
brought
me
here
and
i
thank
him
for
giving
me
his
confidence
the
young
man
blushed
like
a
girl
but
captain
paul
jones
smiled
and
said
nothing
you
have
spoken
like
your
father
s
son
like
the
son
of
madam
wallingford
added
franklin
i
must
say
that
i
honor
your
behavior
i
trust
that
your
high
principle
may
never
fail
you
my
young
friend
but
you
are
putting
it
to
greater
strain
than
if
you
stood
among
the
patriots
who
can
see
but
one
side
the
sage
old
man
looked
at
the
lieutenant
with
a
mild
benevolence
and
approval
that
were
staying
to
the
heart
then
a
shrewd
quick
smile
lighted
his
eyes
again
you
should
be
one
of
the
knights
of
old
come
out
on
his
lady
s
quest
said
benjamin
franklin
and
the
young
man
who
might
have
blushed
again
and
been
annoyed
at
the
jest
only
smiled
back
as
he
might
have
smiled
at
his
own
father
whose
look
had
sometimes
been
as
kind
as
wise
and
masterful
as
this
of
the
old
commissioner
captain
paul
jones
was
in
no
mind
that
this
hour
should
be
wasted
even
though
it
was
a
pleasant
thing
to
see
an
old
man
and
a
young
one
so
happily
at
home
together
he
wished
to
speak
again
for
himself
and
now
rose
with
a
formal
air
sir
i
pray
you
not
to
condemn
me
without
hearing
me
i
have
my
enemies
as
you
have
come
to
know
i
am
convinced
that
at
least
one
of
lee
s
secretaries
is
a
british
spy
i
do
not
blame
england
for
watching
us
but
i
accuse
lee
if
his
fault
is
ignorance
he
is
still
guilty
i
desire
also
to
lay
before
you
my
plans
for
a
cruise
with
the
ranger
roger
wallingford
left
his
own
chair
with
sudden
impulse
and
stood
beside
his
captain
he
was
a
head
taller
and
a
broader
with
the
look
of
an
english
country
gentleman
in
spite
of
his
gold
lace
and
red
waistcoat
and
the
cocked
hat
of
a
lieutenant
of
marines
i
have
already
reminded
you
sir
and
the
other
honorable
commissioners
the
captain
continued
speaking
quickly
that
i
have
the
promise
of
a
better
ship
than
the
ranger
and
that
my
opportunities
of
serving
the
congress
must
wait
in
great
measure
upon
the
event
of
that
promise
being
fulfilled
i
have
also
to
make
formal
complaint
of
the
misdemeanors
of
some
members
of
my
present
crew
i
have
fixed
upon
the
necessity
of
this
and
the
even
greater
necessity
for
money
as
our
men
lack
clothes
and
we
are
running
short
in
every
way
our
men
are
clamorous
for
their
pay
i
have
advanced
them
a
large
sum
on
my
own
account
and
we
are
already
short
of
men
we
must
soon
take
action
in
regard
to
the
exchange
of
prisoners
toward
this
end
wait
a
few
moments
captain
said
the
commissioner
deane
and
adams
should
listen
to
your
reasonable
requests
and
discuss
these
projects
with
your
permission
we
can
dispense
with
the
advice
of
lee
i
have
here
under
consideration
some
important
plans
of
the
french
minister
of
marine
there
was
a
happy
consciousness
in
the
hearts
of
both
the
younger
men
that
they
had
passed
a
severe
examination
not
wholly
without
credit
and
that
the
old
commissioner
would
stand
their
friend
there
were
still
a
few
minutes
of
delay
and
while
the
captain
hastily
reviewed
his
own
thick
budget
of
papers
wallingford
glanced
often
at
franklin
s
worn
face
and
heavy
figure
remembering
that
he
had
lately
said
that
his
life
was
now
at
its
and
might
be
used
and
taken
for
what
it
was
worth
all
the
weight
of
present
cares
and
all
the
weariness
of
age
could
not
forbid
the
habit
of
kindly
patience
and
large
wisdom
which
belonged
to
this
very
great
man
you
are
a
dumb
gentleman
exclaimed
the
captain
as
they
came
away
you
sat
there
most
of
the
time
like
an
elder
of
the
kirk
but
you
and
franklin
seemed
to
understand
each
other
all
the
better
the
higher
a
man
gets
the
less
he
needs
of
speech
my
lord
selkirk
and
his
mates
and
my
dear
duke
of
chartres
they
do
it
all
with
a
nod
and
a
single
word
but
poor
folks
may
chatter
the
day
through
i
was
not
so
garrulous
myself
he
said
appealing
for
approval
and
wallingford
touched
by
such
humility
hastened
to
assure
him
that
the
business
of
the
ranger
had
been
in
his
opinion
most
handsomely
conducted
the
captain
s
fiery
temper
might
well
have
mounted
its
war
chariot
at
certain
junctures
listen
said
paul
jones
as
they
climbed
the
long
slopes
toward
paris
and
their
good
horses
settled
into
a
steady
gait
i
have
often
been
uncertain
of
you
since
we
came
to
sea
yet
i
must
have
a
solid
knowledge
that
you
are
right
at
heart
else
i
could
not
have
had
you
with
me
but
you
have
been
so
vexingly
dumb
you
won
t
speak
out
you
don
t
concern
yourself
and
the
captain
swore
gently
under
his
breath
wallingford
felt
a
touch
of
hot
rage
then
he
laughed
easily
poor
dickson
will
be
disappointed
if
i
do
not
prove
a
spy
in
the
end
he
said
look
captain
franklin
gave
me
these
letters
the
packet
came
for
us
by
the
last
ship
the
lieutenant
had
already
found
time
to
take
a
hasty
look
at
two
letters
of
his
own
his
young
heart
was
heating
fast
against
them
at
that
moment
his
mother
s
prim
and
delicate
handwriting
was
like
a
glimpse
of
her
face
and
he
had
seen
that
mary
hamilton
had
also
written
him
in
the
old
friendly
affectionate
way
with
complete
unconsciousness
of
those
doubts
and
shadows
which
so
shamed
his
own
remembrance
salute
to
the
nor
deem
that
acts
heroic
wait
on
chance
the
man
s
whole
life
preludes
the
single
deed
that
shall
decide
if
his
inheritance
be
with
the
sifted
few
of
matchless
breed
in
midwinter
something
happened
that
lifted
every
true
heart
on
board
there
had
been
dull
and
dreary
weeks
on
board
the
ranger
with
plots
for
desertion
among
the
crew
and
a
general
look
of
surliness
and
reproach
on
all
faces
the
captain
was
eagerly
impatient
in
sending
his
messengers
to
nantes
when
the
paris
post
might
be
expected
and
was
ever
disappointed
at
their
return
the
discipline
of
the
ship
became
more
strict
than
before
now
that
there
was
little
else
to
command
or
insist
upon
the
officers
grew
tired
of
one
another
s
company
and
kept
to
their
own
quarters
or
passed
each
other
without
speaking
it
was
easy
indeed
to
be
displeased
with
such
a
situation
and
to
fret
at
such
an
apparently
needless
loss
of
time
even
if
there
were
nothing
else
to
fret
about
at
last
there
was
some
comfort
in
leaving
nantes
and
making
even
so
short
a
voyage
as
to
the
neighboring
breton
port
of
l
orient
where
the
ranger
was
overhauled
and
refitted
for
sea
yet
even
here
the
men
grumbled
at
their
temporary
discomforts
and
above
all
regretted
nantes
where
they
could
amuse
themselves
better
ashore
it
was
a
hard
stormy
winter
but
there
were
plenty
of
rich
english
ships
almost
within
hand
s
reach
nobody
could
well
understand
why
they
had
done
nothing
while
such
easy
prey
came
and
went
in
those
waters
from
bordeaux
and
the
coast
of
spain
even
from
nantes
itself
on
a
certain
friday
orders
were
given
to
set
sail
and
the
ranger
made
her
way
along
the
coast
to
quiberon
and
anchored
there
at
sunset
before
the
bay
s
entrance
facing
the
great
curve
of
the
shores
she
had
much
shipping
for
company
farther
in
there
lay
a
fine
show
of
french
frigates
with
a
convoy
and
four
ships
of
the
line
the
captain
scanned
these
through
his
glass
and
welcomed
a
great
opportunity
he
had
come
upon
a
division
of
the
french
navy
and
one
of
the
frigates
flew
the
flag
of
a
rear
admiral
la
motte
piqué
the
wind
had
not
fallen
at
sundown
all
night
the
ranger
tossed
about
and
tugged
at
her
anchor
chains
as
if
she
were
impatient
to
continue
her
adventures
like
the
men
between
her
sides
all
the
next
day
she
rode
uneasily
and
clapped
her
sailcloth
and
thrummed
her
rigging
in
the
squally
winter
blast
until
the
sea
grew
quieter
toward
sundown
then
captain
paul
jones
sent
a
boat
to
the
king
s
fleet
to
carry
a
letter
the
boat
was
long
gone
the
distance
was
little
but
difficult
in
such
a
sea
yet
some
of
the
boats
of
the
country
came
out
in
hope
of
trading
with
the
ranger
s
men
the
poor
peasants
would
venture
anything
and
a
swarthy
little
man
who
got
aboard
nobody
knew
how
suddenly
approached
the
captain
where
he
stood
ablaze
with
impatience
on
the
quarter
at
his
first
word
paul
jones
burst
with
startling
readiness
into
spanish
invective
and
then
with
a
look
of
pity
at
the
man
s
poverty
of
dress
in
that
icy
weather
took
a
bit
of
gold
from
his
pocket
barcelona
said
he
i
have
had
good
days
in
barcelona
myself
and
bade
the
spaniard
begone
then
he
called
him
back
and
asked
a
few
questions
and
summoning
a
quartermaster
gave
orders
that
he
should
take
the
sailor
s
poor
gear
and
give
him
a
warm
coat
and
cap
from
the
slop
chests
he
has
lost
his
ship
and
got
stranded
here
said
the
captain
with
compassion
and
then
turned
again
to
watch
for
the
boat
you
may
roll
the
coat
and
cap
into
a
bundle
they
are
things
he
added
carelessly
as
the
quartermaster
went
away
the
bay
was
now
alive
with
small
breton
traders
and
at
a
short
distance
away
there
was
a
droll
little
potato
fleet
making
hopefully
for
the
ranger
the
headmost
boat
however
was
the
ranger
s
own
with
an
answer
to
the
captain
s
letter
he
gave
an
anxious
sigh
and
laid
down
his
glass
he
had
sent
to
say
frankly
to
the
rear
admiral
that
he
flew
the
new
american
flag
and
that
no
foreign
power
had
yet
saluted
it
and
to
ask
if
his
own
salute
to
the
royal
navy
of
france
would
be
properly
returned
it
was
already
in
the
last
fluster
of
the
february
wind
and
the
sea
was
going
down
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
he
broke
the
great
seal
of
his
answer
with
a
trembling
hand
and
at
the
first
glance
pressed
the
letter
to
his
breast
the
french
frigates
were
a
little
apart
from
their
convoy
and
rolled
sullenly
in
a
solemn
company
their
tall
masts
swaying
like
against
the
pale
winter
sky
the
low
land
lay
behind
them
its
line
broken
here
and
there
by
strange
mounds
and
by
ancient
altars
of
the
druids
like
clumsy
beasts
standing
against
the
winter
sunset
the
captain
gave
orders
to
hoist
the
anchor
nobody
knew
why
and
to
spread
the
sails
when
it
was
no
time
to
put
to
sea
he
stood
like
a
king
until
all
was
done
and
then
passed
the
word
for
his
gunners
to
be
ready
and
steered
straight
in
toward
the
french
fleet
they
all
understood
now
the
little
ranger
ran
slowly
between
the
frowning
ships
looking
as
warlike
as
they
her
men
swarmed
like
bees
into
the
rigging
her
colors
ran
up
to
salute
the
flag
of
his
most
christian
majesty
of
france
and
she
fired
one
by
one
her
salute
of
thirteen
guns
there
was
a
moment
of
suspense
the
wind
was
very
light
now
the
powder
smoke
drifted
away
and
the
flapping
sails
sounded
loud
overhead
would
the
admiral
answer
or
would
he
treat
this
bold
challenge
like
a
handkerchief
waved
at
him
from
a
pleasure
boat
some
of
the
officers
on
the
ranger
looked
incredulous
but
paul
jones
still
held
his
letter
in
his
hand
there
was
a
puff
of
white
smoke
and
the
great
guns
of
the
french
flagship
began
to
shake
the
air
two
three
four
five
six
seven
eight
and
then
were
still
save
for
their
echoes
from
the
low
hills
about
carnac
and
the
great
druid
mount
of
michael
gardner
you
may
tell
the
men
that
this
was
the
salute
of
the
king
of
france
to
our
republic
and
the
first
high
honor
to
our
colors
said
the
captain
proudly
to
his
steersman
but
they
were
all
huzzaing
now
along
the
ranger
s
decks
little
ship
whose
name
shall
never
be
forgotten
while
her
country
lives
we
hardly
know
what
this
day
means
gentlemen
he
said
soberly
to
his
officers
who
came
about
him
i
believe
we
are
at
the
christening
of
the
greatest
nation
that
was
ever
born
into
the
world
the
captain
lifted
his
hat
and
stood
looking
up
at
the
flag
the
only
happiness
a
man
ought
to
ask
for
is
happiness
enough
to
get
his
work
done
early
in
april
the
ranger
was
still
waiting
to
put
to
sea
she
had
been
made
ready
and
trained
for
action
like
a
single
gun
in
her
long
weeks
at
brest
the
captain
had
gone
away
on
a
mysterious
errand
afterward
reported
to
be
a
visit
to
amsterdam
directed
by
franklin
who
wished
for
information
regarding
the
affairs
of
the
commissioners
and
the
loss
of
their
frigate
paul
jones
carried
with
him
the
poor
dress
of
that
spanish
seaman
who
had
hoarded
him
at
quiberon
and
made
good
use
of
the
basque
cap
and
his
own
sufficient
knowledge
of
the
spanish
language
to
wallingford
only
he
gave
any
news
of
the
journey
and
it
was
only
wallingford
whom
he
made
his
constant
companion
in
frequent
visits
to
the
duke
of
chartres
and
his
duchess
at
their
country
house
near
the
city
the
sailor
prince
had
welcomed
this
american
captain
and
friend
with
all
the
affection
with
which
he
had
said
farewell
in
virginia
and
hastened
to
present
him
to
his
wife
who
was
not
only
one
of
the
most
charming
of
french
ladies
and
a
of
louis
quatorze
but
granddaughter
of
the
great
count
of
toulouse
that
sailor
son
of
the
king
who
had
won
the
famous
sea
fight
off
malaga
against
the
dutch
and
english
fleets
seventy
years
before
the
beautiful
duchess
was
quick
to
recognize
a
hero
she
was
most
proud
of
her
seafaring
ancestor
and
listened
with
delight
to
paul
jones
as
he
spoke
with
some
french
officers
of
the
malaga
victory
and
showed
his
perfect
acquaintance
with
its
strategy
she
found
him
handsome
spirited
and
full
of
great
qualities
and
at
once
gave
her
warmest
friendship
to
him
and
to
his
cause
all
the
degrading
side
of
a
sailor
s
life
and
hardships
all
the
distresses
that
paul
jones
and
roger
wallingford
had
known
on
board
the
ranger
faded
away
like
bad
dreams
when
they
stood
in
her
presence
they
were
both
true
gentlemen
at
heart
they
were
also
servants
of
their
own
country
in
france
and
now
every
door
flew
open
before
their
wishes
the
future
seemed
but
one
long
triumph
and
delight
paul
jones
the
poor
scottish
lad
who
had
steadily
followed
his
splendid
vision
had
come
at
last
very
near
to
its
reality
and
to
the
true
joys
of
an
unfailing
friendship
the
ranger
sailed
out
of
brest
on
the
of
april
there
had
been
an
attempt
at
mutiny
on
board
but
the
captain
had
quelled
that
and
mastered
the
plot
behind
it
once
at
sea
everything
seemed
to
be
at
rights
again
since
the
ship
was
heading
toward
the
english
coast
the
captain
was
silent
now
as
if
always
brooding
upon
great
affairs
and
appeared
to
have
fallen
into
a
calm
state
of
his
eyes
looked
unconscious
of
whatever
minor
objects
were
reflected
in
their
quick
mirrors
all
his
irascibility
was
for
the
moment
gone
his
face
was
thoughtful
and
even
melancholy
with
a
look
as
if
at
last
he
possessed
some
secret
happiness
and
assurance
glory
herself
had
become
strangely
identified
with
a
beautiful
french
princess
and
he
had
made
a
vow
to
high
heaven
that
he
would
some
day
lay
an
english
frigate
at
her
feet
and
show
himself
worthy
of
her
confidence
and
most
inspiriting
sympathy
the
captain
had
spoken
to
her
of
all
his
hard
and
hopeful
life
as
he
had
never
spoken
to
any
one
she
even
knew
the
story
of
wallingford
and
their
relations
to
mary
hamilton
and
to
each
other
the
duchess
of
chartres
had
listened
eagerly
and
next
day
said
a
word
to
the
lieutenant
that
made
his
young
heart
fairly
quiver
at
such
exquisite
understanding
to
the
captain
she
had
spoken
only
of
glory
as
they
both
understood
it
and
of
a
hero
s
task
and
sacrifice
the
ranger
headed
past
the
channel
and
into
the
irish
sea
at
last
she
stood
over
from
the
isle
of
man
until
the
shores
of
england
were
close
at
hand
behind
a
shifting
veil
of
fog
and
even
those
among
the
ranger
s
crew
whose
best
dreams
were
of
prizes
were
not
unsatisfied
with
their
prospects
when
the
gusty
wind
beat
back
the
fog
they
could
see
the
mountains
of
cumberland
and
the
shapes
of
those
solid
heights
looked
well
to
the
eye
after
the
low
lines
of
the
french
coast
they
had
left
behind
they
passed
st
bees
head
keeping
well
at
sea
and
the
captain
did
some
petty
trading
with
poor
fishermen
to
learn
how
things
stood
now
at
whitehaven
and
whether
there
might
be
frigates
in
those
waters
or
any
foe
too
great
for
so
bold
a
venturer
they
were
beating
against
the
easterly
winds
and
steadily
nearing
the
shore
they
could
see
no
ships
when
the
fog
lifted
though
it
was
a
region
where
much
shipping
went
and
came
there
was
possible
danger
of
alarm
and
that
their
sailing
from
brest
had
been
heralded
by
treachery
the
captain
was
alive
in
every
nerve
and
held
himself
steady
like
a
tiger
in
the
night
whose
best
weapons
must
be
speed
and
silence
wallingford
stood
long
on
deck
in
the
late
afternoon
leaning
against
the
gun
in
his
wonted
place
and
troubled
by
the
persistent
reluctance
of
his
heart
these
were
the
shores
of
england
and
he
was
bound
to
do
them
harm
he
was
not
the
first
man
who
found
it
hard
to
fight
against
the
old
familiar
flag
which
a
few
months
earlier
had
been
his
own
he
had
once
spent
a
few
months
in
the
old
country
after
his
college
course
had
ended
boy
of
eighteen
who
looked
on
at
life
admiringly
as
if
it
were
a
play
he
had
been
happy
enough
in
london
then
and
in
some
country
houses
where
old
family
friends
of
both
his
father
and
his
mother
had
shown
him
much
kindness
and
the
days
had
gone
by
not
so
unlike
the
fashion
of
life
at
home
the
merchants
and
gentlefolk
of
new
england
had
long
been
rich
enough
to
live
at
ease
and
boston
and
portsmouth
with
salem
and
the
harbor
towns
between
were
themselves
but
tiny
londons
in
those
happier
days
before
the
war
each
had
a
few
men
of
learning
and
women
of
the
world
and
were
small
satellites
that
borrowed
their
lesser
light
from
a
central
sun
wallingford
knew
enough
of
the
solid
force
and
dignity
of
england
to
wince
at
the
ignorant
talk
of
the
crew
about
so
formidable
an
enemy
and
again
his
heart
grew
heavy
with
regret
that
this
mother
and
child
among
the
nations
had
been
so
rashly
drawn
into
the
cruelties
of
war
the
king
and
those
who
flattered
him
were
wrong
enough
god
forgive
them
but
the
great
earl
of
chatham
and
fox
and
many
another
man
of
authority
and
power
had
stood
for
the
colonies
for
a
moment
this
heavy
young
heart
grew
even
heavier
with
the
thought
of
being
the
accomplice
of
france
in
such
a
business
but
next
moment
wallingford
angrily
shook
himself
free
from
such
fears
as
these
they
were
the
thoughts
that
had
been
born
in
him
not
his
own
determination
he
had
come
to
fight
for
the
colonies
and
would
trample
down
both
his
fears
and
his
opinions
once
for
all
on
the
ranger
s
deck
the
lieutenant
looked
down
at
the
solid
deck
planks
where
he
stood
had
grown
out
of
the
honest
ground
of
his
own
neighborhood
he
had
come
to
love
his
duty
after
all
and
even
to
love
his
ship
up
went
his
head
again
and
his
heart
was
once
more
hot
within
him
the
only
question
now
was
what
did
the
captain
mean
to
do
the
light
began
to
fade
and
evening
to
fall
the
men
were
heaving
the
lead
and
the
captain
watched
them
listening
anxiously
as
they
told
their
soundings
with
the
practiced
drawl
and
quaint
phrases
that
old
seamen
use
they
could
now
and
then
catch
a
glimpse
of
small
houses
on
the
shore
the
ship
was
evidently
in
shoal
water
and
the
fog
lifted
and
parted
and
thickened
again
as
if
a
skyful
of
clouds
had
dropped
upon
the
sea
presently
the
word
was
passed
to
let
go
the
anchor
and
the
storm
of
oaths
and
exclamations
which
this
involved
owing
to
some
unexpected
hindrance
grew
so
tiresome
to
the
lieutenant
that
he
left
the
place
where
he
had
been
standing
to
go
below
again
look
look
mon
ami
urged
the
captain
eagerly
and
wallingford
turned
to
see
that
the
fog
had
driven
away
while
paul
jones
pointed
toward
a
large
town
and
a
forest
of
vessels
lying
in
the
bay
before
it
huge
flock
of
shipping
for
such
a
port
the
irish
sea
had
emptied
itself
into
whitehaven
and
the
wind
had
gone
down
not
a
sloop
or
a
snow
and
not
a
little
brig
in
a
hurry
could
put
to
sea
again
that
april
night
t
is
old
whitehaven
said
paul
jones
now
i
ll
show
them
that
they
have
made
an
enemy
now
they
ll
know
we
are
to
be
feared
not
laughed
at
i
ll
put
an
end
to
all
their
burnings
in
america
i
ll
harry
their
own
coasts
now
and
frighten
them
back
into
their
hills
before
i
m
done
i
ll
sweep
them
off
their
own
seas
my
chance
is
in
my
hand
dickson
presented
himself
at
this
moment
the
captain
would
not
have
had
him
listening
and
turned
upon
him
angrily
to
hear
what
he
had
to
say
thick
as
coasters
in
portsmouth
lower
harbor
in
a
northeast
blow
commented
the
unwelcome
officer
but
that
s
no
such
handsome
town
as
ours
t
is
a
town
of
three
hundred
ships
mostly
in
the
coal
trade
and
ranks
close
to
newcastle
in
northumberland
t
is
a
town
large
enough
to
be
charged
with
six
hundred
men
for
his
majesty
s
navy
and
the
captain
scowled
we
need
not
take
it
for
a
poor
fishing
village
till
we
have
seen
it
better
a
more
uncertain
coast
from
the
shifting
sands
i
do
not
remember
to
have
known
but
i
can
keep
the
main
channels
well
enough
through
long
acquaintance
he
added
in
a
lower
voice
now
we
are
out
of
this
dungeon
of
fog
thank
god
and
i
shall
creep
in
still
and
steady
as
a
snail
when
i
get
ready
they
could
see
the
gleam
of
white
cliffs
now
as
the
fog
rolled
up
the
hills
t
is
full
of
poor
miners
there
burrowing
like
moles
in
the
dark
earth
said
the
captain
pityingly
a
wretched
life
for
a
christian
then
he
went
to
his
cabin
and
called
his
officers
about
him
and
gave
orders
for
the
night
s
work
i
loved
britain
as
a
man
may
only
love
his
mother
country
but
i
was
misjudged
and
treated
with
such
bitter
harshness
and
contempt
in
my
younger
days
that
i
renounced
my
very
birthright
said
paul
jones
turning
to
wallingford
with
a
strange
impulse
of
sadness
when
the
other
men
had
gone
i
can
not
help
it
now
i
have
made
the
break
and
have
given
my
whole
allegiance
to
our
new
republic
and
all
the
strength
of
me
shall
count
for
something
in
the
building
of
her
noble
future
therefore
i
fight
her
battles
at
whatever
cost
and
on
whatever
soil
being
a
sailor
i
fight
as
a
sailor
and
i
am
here
close
to
the
soil
that
bore
me
t
is
against
a
man
s
own
heart
but
i
am
bent
upon
my
duty
though
it
cost
me
dear
wallingford
did
not
speak
own
reluctance
was
but
hardly
overcome
he
could
not
take
his
eyes
off
the
captain
who
had
grown
unconscious
of
his
presence
it
was
a
manly
face
and
bold
look
but
when
at
rest
there
was
something
of
sad
patience
in
the
eyes
and
boyish
mouth
that
told
of
bafflings
and
disappointments
and
bitter
hardness
in
a
life
that
had
so
breathlessly
climbed
the
steep
ladder
of
ambition
the
flashing
fire
of
his
roused
spirit
the
look
of
eager
bravery
were
both
absent
now
leaving
in
their
places
something
of
great
distinction
but
a
wistfulness
too
a
look
hungry
for
sympathy
pathetic
look
of
simple
bewilderment
which
sometimes
belongs
to
dreamers
and
enthusiasts
who
do
not
know
whither
they
are
being
led
the
wind
was
down
so
that
there
was
no
hope
as
at
first
of
the
ranger
s
running
in
closer
to
the
harbor
with
all
her
fighting
force
and
good
armament
of
guns
there
was
still
light
enough
to
see
that
no
was
standing
guard
over
so
many
merchantmen
the
ranger
herself
looked
innocent
enough
from
shore
on
her
far
anchorage
but
when
darkness
fell
they
hove
up
the
anchor
and
crept
in
a
little
way
till
the
tide
turned
to
go
out
and
it
was
too
dangerous
among
the
shoals
they
anchored
once
more
yet
at
too
great
a
distance
hours
of
delay
ran
by
and
when
the
boats
were
lowered
at
last
there
was
hindrance
still
some
preparations
that
the
captain
had
ordered
were
much
belated
to
his
great
dismay
discipline
was
of
no
avail
they
were
behindhand
in
starting
the
sky
was
clear
of
clouds
now
and
the
night
would
be
all
the
shorter
the
officers
were
silent
wrapped
in
their
heavy
and
the
men
rowed
with
all
the
force
that
was
in
them
the
captain
had
the
surgeon
with
him
in
one
boat
and
some
midshipmen
and
the
other
boat
was
in
charge
of
lieutenant
wallingford
with
dickson
and
hall
there
were
thirty
picked
seamen
more
or
less
in
the
party
the
boats
were
crowded
and
loaded
to
the
gunwale
and
they
parted
company
like
thieves
in
the
night
to
work
their
daring
purposes
the
old
town
of
whitehaven
lay
quiet
there
was
already
a
faint
light
of
coming
dawn
above
the
cumberland
hills
when
they
came
to
the
outer
pier
there
was
a
dim
gleam
of
snow
on
the
heights
under
the
bright
stars
and
the
air
was
bitter
cold
an
old
sea
was
running
high
after
the
late
storms
and
the
boats
dragged
slowly
on
their
errand
the
captain
grew
fierce
and
restless
and
cursed
the
rowers
for
their
slowness
and
the
old
town
of
whitehaven
and
all
her
shipping
lay
sound
asleep
the
captain
s
boat
came
in
first
he
gave
his
orders
with
sure
acquaintance
and
looked
about
him
eagerly
smiling
at
some
vessels
as
if
they
were
old
friends
and
calling
them
by
name
what
with
the
stormy
weather
of
the
past
week
and
an
alarm
about
some
yankee
pirates
that
might
be
coming
on
the
coast
they
had
all
flocked
in
like
sheep
and
lay
stranded
now
as
the
tide
left
them
there
was
a
loud
barking
of
dogs
from
deck
to
deck
but
it
soon
ceased
both
the
boats
had
brought
what
freight
they
could
stow
of
pitch
and
kindlings
and
they
followed
their
orders
the
captain
s
boat
going
to
the
south
side
and
wallingford
s
to
the
north
to
set
fires
among
the
shipping
there
was
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
on
the
south
side
of
the
harbor
where
the
captain
went
were
the
larger
ships
many
of
them
merchantmen
of
three
or
four
hundred
tons
burthen
on
the
north
side
were
smaller
craft
of
every
sort
dutch
doggers
and
the
humble
crafts
that
made
the
living
of
a
family
poor
fish
boat
furnishing
the
tool
for
a
hard
and
meagre
existence
on
few
of
these
was
there
any
riding
light
or
watch
there
was
mutual
protection
in
such
a
company
and
the
harbor
was
like
a
gateless
into
which
the
captain
of
the
ranger
came
boldly
like
a
fox
he
ran
his
boat
ashore
below
the
fort
and
sent
most
of
her
crew
to
set
fires
among
the
vessels
while
he
mounted
the
walls
with
a
few
followers
and
found
the
sentinels
nothing
to
be
feared
they
were
all
asleep
in
the
guardhouse
such
was
the
peace
and
prosperity
of
their
lives
it
was
easy
enough
to
stop
them
from
giving
alarm
and
leave
them
and
gagged
to
find
the
last
half
of
the
night
longer
than
the
first
of
it
a
few
ancient
cannon
were
easily
spiked
and
the
captain
ran
like
a
boy
at
to
the
fort
beyond
to
put
some
other
guns
out
of
commission
they
might
make
mischief
for
him
should
the
town
awake
come
after
me
he
called
i
am
at
home
here
and
the
men
at
his
heels
marveled
at
him
more
than
ever
now
that
they
were
hand
to
hand
with
such
an
instant
piece
of
business
it
took
a
man
that
was
half
devil
to
do
what
the
captain
was
doing
and
they
followed
as
if
they
loved
him
he
stopped
now
in
a
frenzy
of
sudden
rage
they
have
had
time
enough
already
to
start
the
burning
what
keeps
them
there
should
be
a
dozen
fires
lit
now
he
cried
as
he
ran
back
to
the
waterside
the
rest
of
the
boat
s
crew
were
standing
where
he
had
left
them
and
met
his
reproaches
with
scared
faces
they
had
their
pitch
and
tar
with
them
and
had
boarded
a
vessel
but
the
candles
in
their
dark
lanterns
which
were
to
start
the
blaze
had
flickered
and
gone
out
somebody
had
cut
them
short
it
was
a
dirty
trick
and
was
done
on
purpose
they
told
in
loud
indignant
whispers
that
they
had
chosen
an
old
deserted
ship
that
would
have
kindled
everything
near
her
but
they
had
no
light
left
and
the
sky
was
fast
brightening
the
captain
s
face
was
awful
to
look
at
as
he
stood
aghast
there
was
no
sight
of
fire
across
the
harbor
either
and
no
quick
snake
of
flame
could
be
seen
running
up
the
masts
he
stood
for
one
terrible
moment
in
silence
and
despair
and
no
flint
and
steel
among
us
on
such
an
errand
he
gasped
come
with
me
green
he
commanded
and
set
forth
again
running
like
a
deer
back
into
the
town
it
took
but
a
minute
to
pass
by
a
narrow
way
among
some
poor
stone
houses
and
out
across
a
bit
of
open
ground
to
a
cottage
poorer
and
lower
than
any
and
here
paul
jones
lifted
the
clumsy
latch
it
was
a
cottage
of
a
single
room
and
his
companion
followed
hastily
and
stood
waiting
close
behind
oil
the
threshold
nancy
nancy
my
dear
said
the
captain
in
a
gentle
voice
but
thrusting
back
a
warning
hand
to
keep
the
surgeon
out
nancy
ye
ll
not
be
frightened
t
is
no
thief
but
your
poor
laddie
john
paul
that
you
wintered
long
ago
with
a
hurt
leg
an
he
having
none
other
that
would
friend
him
i
ve
come
now
but
to
friend
you
and
to
beg
a
light
there
was
a
cry
of
joy
and
a
sound
of
some
one
rising
in
the
bed
and
the
surgeon
heard
the
captain
s
hasty
steps
as
he
crossed
the
room
in
the
dark
and
kissed
the
old
creature
who
began
to
chatter
in
her
feeble
voice
yes
here
s
your
old
tinder
box
in
its
place
on
the
chimney
said
the
captain
hastily
i
m
only
distressed
for
a
light
mother
nancy
and
my
boat
just
landing
here
s
for
ye
till
i
get
ashore
again
from
my
ship
and
there
was
a
sound
of
a
heavy
handful
of
money
falling
on
the
bed
tak
the
best
candle
child
she
cried
an
promise
me
ye
ll
be
ashore
again
the
morn
s
morn
an
let
me
see
your
bonny
eyes
by
day
i
said
ye
d
come
always
said
ye
d
come
but
the
two
men
were
past
hearing
any
more
as
they
ran
away
with
their
treasure
why
in
god
s
name
did
you
leave
the
door
wide
open
said
the
surgeon
she
ll
die
of
a
pleurisy
and
your
gold
will
only
serve
to
bury
her
there
was
no
time
for
dallying
the
heap
of
combustibles
on
one
old
vessel
s
deck
was
quick
set
afire
now
and
flung
down
the
hatches
and
a
barrel
of
tar
was
poured
into
the
flames
this
old
brig
was
well
careened
against
another
and
their
yards
were
fouled
there
was
no
time
to
do
more
the
two
would
easily
scatter
fire
to
all
their
neighborhood
when
the
morning
wind
sprung
up
to
help
them
and
the
captain
and
his
men
must
put
off
to
sea
there
were
still
no
signs
of
life
on
the
shore
or
the
fort
above
they
all
gathered
to
the
boat
the
oarsmen
were
getting
their
places
when
all
at
once
there
was
a
cry
among
the
lanes
close
by
and
a
crowd
of
men
were
upon
them
the
alarm
had
been
given
and
the
ranger
s
men
were
pressed
hard
in
a
desperate
close
fight
the
captain
stood
on
the
end
of
the
little
pier
with
his
pistol
and
held
back
some
of
the
attacking
party
for
one
terrible
minute
till
all
his
men
were
in
lay
out
lay
out
my
boys
he
cried
then
from
his
own
place
in
the
stern
there
were
bullets
raining
about
them
but
they
were
quick
out
of
harm
s
way
on
the
water
there
was
not
a
man
of
that
boat
s
company
could
forget
the
captain
s
calmness
and
daring
as
they
saw
him
stand
against
the
angry
crowd
the
flames
were
leaping
up
the
rigging
of
the
burning
ship
the
shore
was
alive
with
men
there
were
crowds
of
people
swarming
away
up
among
the
hills
beyond
the
houses
there
had
been
a
cannon
overlooked
or
some
old
ship
s
gun
lay
upon
the
beach
which
presently
spoke
with
futile
bravado
bellowing
its
hasty
charge
when
the
captain
s
boat
was
well
out
upon
the
bay
the
hills
were
black
with
frightened
folk
as
if
whitehaven
were
a
ruined
the
poor
town
was
in
a
terror
on
the
other
side
of
the
harbor
there
was
no
blaze
even
yet
and
the
captain
stood
in
his
boat
swaying
to
its
quick
movement
with
anxious
eyes
set
to
looking
for
the
other
men
there
were
people
running
along
the
harbor
side
and
excited
shapes
on
the
decks
of
the
merchantmen
suddenly
to
his
relief
of
mind
he
saw
the
other
boat
coming
out
from
behind
a
dutch
brig
lieutenant
hall
was
in
command
of
her
now
and
he
stood
up
and
saluted
when
he
came
near
enough
to
speak
our
lights
failed
us
sir
he
said
looking
very
grave
somebody
had
tampered
with
all
our
candles
before
we
left
the
ship
an
alarm
was
given
almost
at
once
and
our
landing
party
was
attacked
dickson
was
set
upon
and
injured
but
escaped
wallingford
is
left
ashore
the
alarm
was
given
just
after
we
separated
said
dickson
lifting
himself
from
the
bottom
of
the
boat
i
heard
loud
cries
for
the
guard
and
a
man
set
upon
me
so
that
i
am
near
murdered
they
could
not
have
watched
us
coming
you
see
there
has
been
treachery
our
fine
lieutenant
has
stayed
ashore
from
choice
that
will
do
sir
blazed
the
captain
i
must
hear
what
you
have
done
with
wallingford
let
us
get
back
to
our
ship
and
the
two
boats
sped
away
with
what
swiftness
they
could
across
the
great
stretch
of
rough
water
some
of
the
men
were
regretful
but
some
wore
a
hard
and
surly
look
as
they
bent
to
their
heavy
oars
man
s
yet
have
they
still
such
eyes
to
wait
on
them
as
are
too
piercing
that
they
can
behold
and
penetrate
the
inwards
of
the
heart
the
men
left
on
board
the
ranger
with
lieutenant
simpson
in
command
who
had
been
watching
all
these
long
hours
now
saw
clouds
of
smoke
rising
from
among
the
shipping
but
none
from
the
other
side
of
the
town
where
they
knew
the
captain
had
ordered
many
fires
to
be
set
among
the
warehouses
the
two
boats
were
at
last
seen
returning
in
company
and
the
ranger
which
had
drifted
seaward
made
shift
with
the
morning
breeze
to
wear
a
little
nearer
and
pick
them
up
there
was
a
great
smoke
in
the
harbor
but
the
town
itself
stood
safe
the
captain
looked
back
eagerly
from
the
height
of
the
deck
after
he
came
aboard
then
his
face
fell
i
have
been
balked
of
my
purpose
he
cried
curse
such
treachery
among
ye
thank
god
i
ve
frightened
them
and
shown
what
a
yankee
captain
may
dare
to
do
if
i
had
been
an
hour
earlier
and
no
sneaking
cur
had
tampered
with
our
lights
he
was
pale
with
excitement
and
stood
there
at
first
triumphant
and
next
instant
cursing
his
hard
luck
the
smoke
among
the
shipping
was
already
less
the
ranger
was
running
seaward
as
if
the
mountains
had
waked
all
their
sleepy
winds
and
sent
them
out
to
hurry
her
there
was
a
crowd
on
deck
about
the
men
who
had
returned
and
the
sailors
on
the
yards
were
calling
down
to
their
fellows
to
ask
questions
the
captain
had
so
far
taken
no
notice
of
any
one
or
even
of
this
great
confusion
who
s
your
gentleman
now
dickson
s
voice
suddenly
rang
triumphant
like
a
cracked
trumpet
above
the
sounds
of
bragging
narrative
that
were
punctuated
by
oaths
to
both
heaven
and
the
underworld
who
s
a
traitor
and
a
damned
dog
of
a
tory
now
who
dropped
our
spare
candles
overboard
and
dirtied
his
pretty
fingers
to
spoil
the
rest
who
gave
alarm
quick
s
he
got
his
boat
ashore
and
might
have
had
us
all
strung
up
on
their
english
gallows
before
sunset
dickson
was
standing
with
his
back
against
the
mast
with
a
audience
about
him
officious
to
give
exact
details
of
the
expedition
aloft
they
stopped
who
were
shaking
out
the
sails
and
tried
to
hear
what
he
was
saying
at
this
moment
old
cooper
lowered
himself
hand
over
hand
coming
down
on
the
run
into
the
middle
of
the
company
before
he
could
be
stopped
and
struck
dickson
a
mighty
blow
in
the
breast
that
knocked
him
breathless
some
of
dickson
s
followers
set
upon
cooper
in
return
but
he
twisted
out
of
their
clutch
being
a
man
of
great
strength
and
size
and
took
himself
off
to
a
little
distance
where
he
stood
and
looked
up
imploringly
at
the
captain
and
then
dropped
his
big
head
into
his
hands
and
began
to
sob
the
captain
came
to
the
edge
of
the
and
looked
down
at
him
without
speaking
just
then
dickson
was
able
to
recover
speech
he
had
nearly
every
man
aboard
for
his
audience
you
had
ten
minutes
to
the
good
afore
wallingford
follered
ye
bellowed
hanscom
one
of
the
berwick
men
who
had
been
in
the
same
boat
i
saw
nothing
of
the
judge
s
noble
son
he
took
good
care
of
that
answered
dickson
boldly
and
there
was
a
cry
of
approval
among
those
who
had
suspected
wallingford
they
were
now
in
the
right
they
at
last
had
proof
that
wallingford
deserved
the
name
of
traitor
or
any
evil
name
they
might
be
disposed
to
call
him
every
man
in
the
lieutenant
s
boat
was
eager
to
be
heard
and
to
tell
his
own
story
hall
had
disappeared
as
for
wallingford
he
was
not
there
to
plead
for
himself
and
his
accusers
had
it
all
their
own
way
i
tell
ye
i
ain
t
afraid
but
he
s
all
right
a
man
s
character
ought
to
count
for
something
cried
hanscom
but
there
was
a
roar
of
contempt
from
those
who
had
said
from
the
first
that
a
tory
was
a
tory
and
that
wallingford
had
no
business
to
be
playing
at
officer
aboard
the
ranger
and
making
shift
to
stand
among
proper
seamen
he
had
gone
ashore
alone
and
stayed
ashore
and
there
had
been
a
sudden
alarm
in
the
town
the
black
truth
stared
everybody
in
the
face
the
captain
s
first
rage
had
already
quieted
in
these
few
minutes
since
they
had
come
aboard
and
his
face
had
settled
into
a
look
of
stolid
disappointment
and
weariness
he
had
given
whitehaven
a
great
fright
was
something
the
news
of
it
would
quickly
travel
along
the
coast
he
went
to
his
cabin
now
and
summoned
dickson
and
hall
to
make
their
statements
lieutenant
hall
had
no
wish
to
be
the
speaker
but
the
fluent
dickson
battered
and
minutely
described
the
experience
of
the
boat
s
company
it
certainly
seemed
true
enough
that
wallingford
had
deserted
lieutenant
hall
could
contradict
nothing
that
was
said
though
the
captain
directly
appealed
to
him
more
than
once
after
all
we
have
only
your
own
word
for
what
happened
on
shore
said
the
captain
brutally
as
if
dickson
were
but
a
witness
in
court
before
the
opposing
attorney
you
have
only
my
word
said
dickson
i
suppose
you
think
that
you
can
doubt
it
at
least
you
can
see
that
i
have
suffered
i
feel
the
effects
of
the
blows
and
my
clothes
are
dripping
here
on
your
cabin
floor
in
a
way
that
will
cause
you
discomfort
i
have
already
told
you
all
i
can
i
know
not
what
to
believe
answered
paul
jones
after
a
moment
s
reflection
but
taking
no
notice
of
the
man
s
really
suffering
condition
the
captain
stood
mute
looking
squarely
into
dickson
s
face
as
if
he
were
still
speaking
it
was
very
uncomfortable
lieutenant
wallingford
is
a
man
of
character
some
misfortune
may
have
overtaken
him
at
the
last
moment
he
made
the
most
of
the
moments
he
had
sneered
dickson
then
the
watch
was
upon
us
i
had
hard
work
to
escape
i
tried
to
do
my
best
roared
the
captain
what
s
tis
the
excuse
of
a
whiner
to
say
he
a
man
either
does
the
thing
he
ought
or
he
does
it
not
i
gave
your
orders
with
care
sir
the
treachery
began
here
on
hoard
there
should
have
been
fires
set
in
those
spots
i
commanded
t
was
the
business
of
my
officers
to
see
that
this
was
done
and
to
have
their
proper
lights
at
hand
curse
such
incompetence
curse
your
and
your
jealousy
of
me
and
one
another
he
railed
this
is
what
you
count
for
when
my
work
is
at
the
pinch
if
only
my
good
fellows
of
the
alfred
had
been
with
me
i
might
have
laid
three
hundred
ships
in
ashes
with
half
whitehaven
town
dickson
s
face
wore
a
fresh
look
of
triumph
the
captain
s
hopes
were
confessedly
dashed
to
ground
and
the
listener
was
the
better
pleased
hall
a
decent
man
looked
sorry
enough
but
dickson
s
expression
of
countenance
lent
fuel
to
the
flames
of
wrath
and
the
captain
saw
his
look
i
could
sooner
believe
that
last
night
s
villain
were
yourself
sir
he
blazed
out
suddenly
and
dickson
s
smug
face
grew
a
horrid
color
the
attack
was
so
furious
that
he
was
not
without
fear
a
better
man
would
have
suffered
shame
i
take
that
from
nobody
you
forget
yourself
captain
jones
he
managed
to
say
with
choking
throat
and
then
the
viper
s
instinct
in
his
breast
made
him
take
revenge
you
should
be
more
civil
to
your
officers
sir
you
have
insulted
too
many
of
us
remember
that
we
are
american
citizens
and
you
have
given
even
wallingford
good
reason
to
hate
you
he
is
of
a
slow
sort
but
he
may
have
bided
his
time
the
bravery
of
the
hypocrite
counted
for
much
paul
jones
stared
at
him
for
a
moment
wounded
to
the
quick
and
speechless
then
you
sneaking
thief
he
hissed
between
his
teeth
am
i
to
be
baited
by
a
coward
like
you
we
ll
see
who
s
the
better
man
but
at
this
lamentable
juncture
lieutenant
hall
stepped
between
and
by
dint
of
hard
pushing
urged
the
offending
dickson
to
the
deck
again
such
low
quarrels
were
getting
to
be
too
common
on
the
ranger
but
this
time
he
was
not
unwilling
to
take
the
captain
s
part
dickson
was
chilled
to
the
bone
and
his
teeth
were
chattering
the
bruises
on
his
face
were
swelling
fast
he
looked
like
a
man
that
had
been
foully
dealt
with
well
pounded
and
then
ducked
as
hall
had
once
seen
an
offender
treated
by
angry
fishwives
in
the
port
of
leith
there
was
much
heaviness
among
those
berwick
men
who
stood
bravely
for
roger
wallingford
one
of
them
at
least
refused
to
be
comforted
and
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
in
sorrow
when
the
lieutenant
s
fate
was
discussed
at
first
he
had
boldly
insisted
that
they
would
soon
find
out
the
truth
but
there
were
those
who
were
ready
to
confute
every
argument
even
that
of
experience
and
now
even
poor
cooper
went
sad
and
silent
about
his
work
and
fought
the
young
squire
s
enemies
no
more
have
made
prey
of
implacable
hate
patient
cunning
and
a
sleepless
refinement
of
device
to
inflict
the
extremest
anguish
on
an
enemy
these
things
are
evil
while
wallingford
insisted
that
he
must
carry
out
the
captain
s
plain
instructions
to
the
letter
the
moment
their
boat
touched
the
landing
steps
dickson
leaped
over
the
side
and
ran
up
the
pier
he
had
said
carelessly
that
it
was
no
use
to
risk
several
lives
where
one
might
serve
it
was
possible
that
they
had
been
seen
approaching
and
he
would
go
and
play
the
scout
and
select
their
buildings
for
firing
both
the
lieutenants
wallingford
and
hall
took
this
breach
of
discipline
angrily
there
seemed
to
be
an
aggravating
desire
in
dickson
s
heart
to
put
himself
first
now
when
it
would
count
to
his
own
gain
their
orders
had
been
to
leave
the
boat
in
his
charge
while
the
landing
party
was
away
and
in
the
next
few
moments
when
he
had
disappeared
into
the
narrow
street
that
led
up
from
the
small
pier
wallingford
grew
uneasy
and
went
ashore
himself
he
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
pier
and
then
heard
dickson
s
voice
calling
at
no
great
distance
as
if
for
help
as
he
started
to
run
that
way
he
shouted
to
the
men
below
to
follow
him
his
voice
was
lost
in
the
noise
of
waves
lapping
and
splashing
about
them
against
the
pier
they
heard
his
cry
but
could
not
tell
what
it
meant
or
whether
they
should
stay
or
go
the
captain
s
orders
had
been
strict
that
all
three
of
the
elder
officers
should
not
leave
the
boat
at
once
young
hill
the
midshipman
a
fine
brave
fellow
now
landed
but
in
the
dim
light
he
could
see
nobody
and
returned
the
discovery
was
then
made
that
they
had
all
their
kindlings
and
tar
in
readiness
but
there
were
no
candles
left
in
the
two
lanterns
and
the
bag
of
spare
candles
and
tinder
box
which
the
midshipman
had
in
charge
was
no
longer
to
be
found
in
the
boat
it
had
been
laid
next
the
thwart
and
in
crossing
some
rough
water
might
have
fallen
overboard
though
nobody
could
understand
the
accident
they
could
only
wait
now
in
mortification
and
distress
for
wallingford
s
return
and
some
minutes
passed
in
a
grievous
uncertainty
the
lieutenant
had
much
resented
dickson
s
show
of
authority
and
feared
the
ill
success
of
his
errand
although
he
had
no
liking
for
the
man
it
was
no
time
to
consider
personalities
they
were
all
on
duty
and
must
report
to
their
commander
it
was
certainly
dangerous
for
a
man
to
venture
ashore
alone
and
the
first
distant
outcry
set
him
running
at
the
top
of
his
speed
expecting
the
landing
party
to
follow
wallingford
was
and
as
he
ran
he
plainly
heard
dickson
s
voice
once
more
and
then
all
was
silent
he
hurried
along
keeping
close
to
the
walls
of
warehouses
and
came
next
into
a
street
of
common
poor
dwellings
of
the
seafaring
folk
then
he
stopped
and
listened
and
whistled
a
call
familiar
enough
to
dickson
or
any
man
of
the
somersworth
and
berwick
neighborhoods
as
if
they
had
strayed
from
each
other
hunting
in
the
old
york
woods
there
was
no
answer
and
he
turned
to
go
back
he
must
rejoin
his
men
and
attend
to
duty
and
dickson
must
take
care
of
himself
there
were
dark
alleys
that
led
from
this
narrow
thoroughfare
to
the
water
side
he
heard
footfalls
and
again
stood
listening
in
the
shelter
of
a
deep
doorway
when
a
group
of
men
burst
out
of
a
side
lane
armed
and
with
a
soldier
or
two
among
them
they
ran
down
the
street
toward
the
shore
and
took
a
short
way
round
a
corner
wallingford
heard
a
word
or
two
which
made
him
sure
they
had
been
given
warning
it
flashed
through
his
brain
that
this
was
dickson
s
business
and
plan
for
revenge
if
their
own
men
were
still
in
the
boat
or
near
it
seemed
likely
since
they
had
not
followed
him
would
be
safe
enough
but
danger
threatened
them
all
there
was
a
sound
of
gathering
voices
and
frightened
outcries
and
slamming
doors
beyond
in
the
town
as
if
the
whole
place
were
astir
and
the
morning
light
was
growing
fast
in
the
sky
and
making
a
new
day
in
the
dark
little
street
there
was
nothing
for
wallingford
to
do
but
to
hurry
back
to
the
boat
as
best
he
might
in
some
of
the
neighboring
houses
they
had
heard
the
guard
go
by
and
sleepy
heads
were
appearing
to
learn
the
news
the
lieutenant
made
haste
just
as
he
passed
the
side
passage
whence
the
men
had
come
dickson
himself
appeared
through
an
archway
just
beyond
and
stopped
to
call
watch
watch
the
yankees
are
in
the
town
to
set
it
burning
watch
he
was
crying
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
instead
of
that
faint
help
which
had
seemed
to
cry
for
mercy
in
wallingford
s
ears
and
had
enticed
him
into
peril
of
his
life
with
one
bound
wallingford
leaped
upon
the
scoundrel
and
caught
him
in
a
mighty
clutch
there
was
the
look
of
a
fiend
in
dickson
s
face
in
the
dim
light
as
he
turned
and
saw
the
man
he
hated
most
and
the
two
clinched
in
a
fury
then
dickson
remembered
the
straight
knife
in
his
belt
and
as
they
fought
he
twisted
himself
free
enough
to
get
it
in
his
hand
and
strike
next
moment
wallingford
was
flat
on
the
cobblestones
heavily
fallen
with
a
deep
cut
in
his
shoulder
there
were
men
running
their
way
and
dickson
fled
before
them
he
had
been
badly
mauled
before
the
trick
of
stabbing
could
set
him
free
the
breath
was
sobbing
out
of
his
lungs
from
the
struggle
but
he
ran
unhindered
to
the
pier
end
past
the
gaping
townsfolk
and
threw
himself
into
the
water
striking
out
for
the
boat
which
had
drawn
well
away
from
shore
there
was
a
loud
shout
at
his
escape
but
he
was
a
good
swimmer
they
were
watching
from
the
boat
and
when
they
saw
that
dickson
lagged
they
drew
nearer
and
dragged
him
in
it
was
all
in
a
moment
there
was
firing
at
them
now
from
the
shore
hall
and
the
midshipman
were
at
the
very
worst
of
their
disappointment
they
had
failed
in
their
errand
the
whole
thing
was
a
fiasco
and
worse
then
dickson
though
sick
and
heavy
from
such
an
intake
of
salt
water
managed
to
speak
and
tell
them
that
wallingford
had
waked
the
town
he
must
have
found
the
guardhouse
at
once
for
the
watch
was
out
and
had
even
set
upon
himself
as
he
returned
he
had
reconnoitred
carefully
and
found
all
safe
when
he
heard
a
man
behind
him
and
had
to
fight
for
his
life
then
he
heard
wallingford
calling
and
beating
upon
the
doors
they
might
know
whether
they
had
shipped
a
tory
now
dickson
could
speak
no
more
and
sank
down
as
if
he
were
spent
indeed
into
the
bottom
of
the
boat
he
could
tell
already
where
every
blow
had
struck
him
and
a
faintness
weakened
his
not
too
sturdy
frame
now
they
could
see
the
shipping
all
afire
across
the
harbor
as
they
drew
out
the
other
boat
s
party
had
done
their
work
and
it
was
near
to
broad
day
now
the
people
were
running
and
crying
confusion
and
boats
were
putting
out
along
the
shore
and
an
alarm
bell
kept
up
an
incessant
ringing
in
the
town
the
ranger
s
men
rowed
with
all
their
might
dickson
did
not
even
care
because
the
captain
would
give
the
boat
a
rating
he
had
paid
back
old
scores
to
the
lofty
young
squire
his
enemy
and
scorner
the
fault
of
their
failure
would
be
wallingford
s
his
heart
was
light
enough
he
had
done
his
work
well
if
wallingford
was
not
already
dead
or
bleeding
to
death
like
a
pig
back
there
in
the
street
the
whitehaven
folk
were
like
to
make
a
pretty
hanging
of
him
before
sunset
there
was
one
pity
had
left
his
knife
sticking
in
the
tory
s
shoulder
and
this
caused
a
moment
of
sharp
regret
but
it
was
a
plain
sailor
s
knife
which
he
had
lately
got
by
chance
at
brest
and
there
were
no
witnesses
to
the
encounter
his
word
was
as
good
as
wallingford
s
to
most
men
on
their
ship
he
began
to
long
for
the
moment
when
the
captain
should
hear
their
news
he
s
none
so
great
a
hero
yet
thought
dickson
and
groaned
with
pain
as
the
boat
lurched
and
shifted
him
where
he
lay
like
ballast
among
the
unused
kindlings
wallingford
had
given
him
a
fine
lasting
legacy
of
blows
prisoner
and
close
at
thy
side
i
walk
unseen
and
feel
thy
passion
and
thy
prayer
wide
separation
doth
but
prove
the
mystic
might
of
human
love
the
poor
lieutenant
was
soon
turned
over
scornfully
by
a
musket
butt
and
the
toe
of
a
stout
whitehaven
shoe
the
blood
was
steadily
running
from
his
shoulder
and
his
coat
was
all
sodden
with
a
sticky
wetness
he
had
struck
his
head
as
he
fell
and
was
at
this
moment
happily
unconscious
of
all
his
woes
let
him
lie
the
devil
growled
a
second
man
who
came
along
citizen
armed
with
a
long
cutlass
but
stupid
with
fear
and
resenting
the
loss
of
his
morning
sleep
and
all
his
peace
of
mind
they
could
see
the
light
of
the
burning
vessel
on
the
roofs
above
let
s
get
away
a
bit
further
from
the
shore
said
he
there
may
be
their
whole
ship
s
company
landed
and
ranging
the
town
this
damned
fellow
ll
do
nobody
any
mischief
agreed
the
soldier
and
away
they
ran
but
presently
his
companion
stole
back
to
find
if
there
were
anything
for
an
honest
man
and
a
wronged
one
in
this
harmless
officer
s
pockets
there
were
some
letters
in
women
s
writing
that
could
be
of
no
use
to
any
one
and
some
tobacco
t
is
the
best
american
sort
said
the
old
citizen
who
had
once
been
a
sailor
in
the
virginia
trade
he
saw
the
knife
sticking
fast
and
pulled
it
out
but
finding
it
was
a
cheap
thing
enough
and
disagreeable
just
now
to
have
in
hand
he
tossed
it
carelessly
aside
he
found
a
purse
of
money
in
one
pocket
and
a
handsome
watch
with
a
seal
like
some
great
gentleman
s
but
this
was
strangely
hooked
and
ringed
to
the
fob
buttons
and
the
chain
so
strong
that
though
a
man
pulled
hard
enough
to
break
it
and
even
set
his
foot
on
the
stranger
s
thigh
to
get
a
good
purchase
the
links
would
not
give
way
the
citizen
looked
for
the
convenient
knife
again
but
missed
it
under
the
shadow
of
the
wall
there
were
people
coming
he
pocketed
what
he
had
got
and
looked
behind
him
anxiously
then
he
got
up
and
ran
away
only
half
content
with
the
purse
and
good
tobacco
an
old
woman
and
a
girl
with
her
were
peeping
through
the
dirty
panes
of
a
poor
narrow
house
close
by
and
now
seeing
that
there
was
such
a
pretty
gentleman
in
distress
and
that
the
citizen
whom
they
knew
and
treasured
a
grudge
against
had
been
frightened
away
they
came
out
to
drag
him
into
shelter
just
as
they
stepped
forth
together
on
the
street
however
a
squad
of
soldiers
coming
up
at
captured
this
easy
prisoner
whose
heart
was
beating
yet
one
of
them
put
the
hanging
watch
into
his
own
pocket
unseen
enough
it
came
easily
into
his
hand
and
after
some
consideration
of
so
grave
a
matter
of
military
necessity
two
of
them
lifted
wallingford
and
finding
him
both
long
and
heavy
called
a
third
to
help
and
turned
back
to
carry
him
to
the
by
the
time
they
reached
the
door
a
good
quarter
part
of
the
townsfolk
seemed
to
be
following
in
procession
with
angry
shouts
and
tearful
voices
of
women
begging
to
know
if
their
husbands
or
lovers
had
been
seen
in
danger
and
there
were
loud
threats
too
meant
for
the
shaming
of
the
silent
figure
carried
by
stout
yeomen
of
the
guard
after
some
hours
wallingford
waked
wretched
with
the
smart
of
his
wounds
and
dazed
by
the
first
sight
of
his
strange
lodging
in
the
town
jail
there
were
no
friends
to
succor
him
he
had
not
even
the
resource
of
being
mistaken
for
a
tory
and
a
friend
of
the
crown
there
were
at
least
three
strutting
heroes
showing
themselves
in
different
quarters
of
the
town
that
evening
who
claimed
the
honor
of
giving
such
a
dangerous
pirate
his
deathblow
some
days
passed
before
the
officer
in
charge
of
this
frightened
seaport
stricken
with
sincere
dismay
and
apprehensive
of
still
greater
disaster
from
such
stealthy
neighbors
on
the
sea
could
receive
the
answer
to
his
report
sent
to
headquarters
wallingford
felt
more
and
more
the
despair
of
his
situation
the
orders
came
at
last
that
as
soon
as
he
could
be
moved
he
should
be
sent
to
join
his
fellow
rebels
in
the
old
mill
prison
at
plymouth
the
whitehaven
citizens
should
not
risk
or
invite
any
attempt
at
his
rescue
by
his
stay
but
far
from
regretting
his
presence
there
were
even
those
who
lamented
his
departure
who
would
have
willingly
bought
new
ribbons
to
their
bonnets
to
go
and
see
such
a
rogue
hanged
wounded
shoulder
and
all
on
a
convenient
hill
and
proper
gallows
outside
the
town
none
of
the
barley
ships
or
colliers
dared
to
come
or
go
the
fishing
boats
that
ventured
out
to
their
business
came
home
in
a
flutter
at
the
sight
of
a
strange
sail
and
presently
whitehaven
was
aghast
at
the
news
of
the
robbery
of
all
my
lady
selkirk
s
plate
and
the
astonishing
capture
of
his
majesty
s
guardship
drake
out
of
carrickfergus
and
six
merchantmen
taken
beside
in
the
irish
sea
of
them
sunk
and
three
of
them
sent
down
as
prizes
to
french
ports
the
quicker
such
a
prisoner
left
this
part
of
the
realm
the
better
for
whitehaven
the
sheriff
and
a
strong
guard
waited
next
morning
at
the
door
of
the
jail
and
wallingford
taken
from
his
hard
bed
was
set
on
a
steady
horse
to
begin
the
long
southward
journey
and
be
handed
on
from
jail
to
jail
the
fresh
air
of
the
spring
morning
after
the
close
odors
of
his
prison
at
first
revived
him
even
the
pain
of
his
wound
was
forgotten
and
he
took
the
change
gladly
not
knowing
whither
he
went
or
what
the
journey
was
meant
to
bring
him
at
first
they
climbed
long
hills
in
sight
of
the
sea
notwithstanding
all
his
impatience
of
the
sordid
jealousies
and
discomforts
of
life
on
board
the
ranger
roger
wallingford
turned
his
weak
and
painful
body
more
than
once
trying
to
catch
a
last
glimpse
of
the
tall
masts
of
the
brave
fleet
little
ship
a
remembrance
of
the
of
his
friends
aboard
seemed
to
make
a
man
forget
everything
else
and
to
put
warmth
in
his
heart
though
the
chill
wind
on
the
fells
blew
through
his
very
bones
for
the
first
time
he
had
been
treated
as
a
man
among
men
on
board
the
ranger
in
early
youth
the
heir
of
a
rich
man
could
not
but
be
exposed
to
the
flatteries
of
those
who
sought
his
father
s
favors
and
of
late
his
property
and
influence
counted
the
loyalists
far
more
than
any
of
that
counsel
out
of
his
own
heart
for
which
some
of
them
had
begged
obsequiously
now
he
had
come
face
to
face
with
life
as
plain
men
knew
it
and
his
sentiment
of
sympathy
had
grown
and
doubled
in
the
hard
process
he
winced
at
the
remembrance
of
that
he
had
so
cherished
in
earlier
years
he
had
come
near
to
falling
an
easy
prey
to
those
who
called
him
sir
roger
and
were
but
serving
their
own
selfish
ends
who
cared
little
for
either
old
england
or
new
and
still
less
for
their
king
there
was
no
such
thing
as
a
neutral
either
a
man
was
one
thing
or
the
other
and
now
his
head
grew
light
and
dizzy
while
one
of
those
sudden
visions
of
mary
hamilton
s
face
the
brave
sweetness
of
her
living
eyes
as
if
they
were
close
to
his
own
made
him
forget
the
confused
thoughts
of
the
moment
before
the
quick
bracing
of
the
morning
air
was
too
much
for
the
prisoner
he
felt
more
and
more
as
if
he
were
dreaming
there
was
a
strange
longing
in
his
heart
to
be
back
in
the
shelter
and
quiet
of
the
jail
itself
there
began
to
be
a
dull
roaring
in
his
ears
like
a
sharp
pain
there
came
to
him
the
thought
of
home
of
his
mother
s
looks
and
her
smile
as
she
stood
watching
at
the
window
when
he
came
riding
home
he
was
not
riding
home
now
the
thought
of
it
choked
his
throat
he
remembered
his
mother
as
he
had
proudly
seen
her
once
in
her
satin
gown
and
her
laces
and
diamonds
at
the
great
feast
for
governor
hutchinson
s
birthday
in
the
province
house
far
the
first
to
his
young
eyes
of
the
fine
distinguished
ladies
who
were
there
how
frail
and
slender
she
stood
among
them
but
now
a
wretched
weakness
mastered
him
he
was
afraid
to
think
where
he
might
be
going
they
could
not
know
how
ill
and
helpless
he
was
these
stout
men
of
his
guard
who
sometimes
watched
him
angrily
and
then
fell
to
talking
together
in
low
voices
the
chill
of
the
mountain
cloud
they
were
riding
into
seemed
to
have
got
to
his
heart
again
his
brain
failed
him
and
then
grew
frightfully
clear
again
then
he
began
to
fall
asleep
in
the
saddle
and
to
know
that
he
slept
jolting
and
swaying
as
they
began
to
ride
faster
the
horse
was
a
steady
plodding
creature
whose
old
sides
felt
warm
and
comfortable
to
the
dreaming
rider
he
wished
ever
so
dimly
that
if
he
fell
they
would
leave
him
there
by
the
road
and
let
him
sleep
he
lost
a
stirrup
now
and
it
struck
his
ankle
sharply
to
remind
him
but
there
was
no
use
to
try
to
get
it
again
then
everything
turned
black
one
of
the
soldiers
caught
the
horse
just
as
the
prisoner
s
head
began
to
drag
along
the
frozen
road
his
wound
s
bad
he
shouted
to
the
others
who
were
riding
on
their
horses
pressing
each
other
close
and
their
cloaks
held
over
their
faces
in
the
cold
mountain
wind
here
ahoy
our
man
s
dead
lads
the
blood
s
trailed
out
o
him
all
along
the
road
he
s
cheated
justice
then
curse
him
said
the
officer
smartly
looking
down
from
his
horse
but
the
old
corporal
who
had
fought
at
quebec
with
wolfe
and
knew
soldiering
by
heart
though
he
was
low
on
the
ladder
of
promotion
by
reason
of
an
unconquerable
love
of
brandy
old
corporal
dropped
on
his
knees
and
felt
wallingford
s
heart
beating
small
and
quick
inside
the
wet
stained
coat
and
then
took
off
his
own
ragged
riding
cloak
to
wrap
him
from
the
cold
poor
lad
he
said
compassionately
i
think
he
s
fell
among
thieves
somehow
by
t
looks
of
him
t
is
an
honest
face
of
a
young
gentleman
s
iver
i
see
there
s
nowt
for
t
now
but
a
litter
an
t
get
some
grog
down
his
starved
throat
i
misdoubt
he
s
dead
as
t
stones
in
road
ere
we
get
to
kendal
get
him
again
jeered
another
man
if
we
had
some
alegar
now
we
mought
fetch
him
to
say
whaar
er
ye
boun
ye
are
sae
dond
out
in
reed
wescut
an
lace
and
he
pushed
wallingford
s
limp
heavy
body
with
an
impatient
foot
but
the
prisoner
made
no
answer
at
the
what
have
the
heralds
come
to
tell
this
quiet
shore
of
victories
there
is
a
mother
weeping
for
her
son
like
some
lean
tree
whose
fruit
has
dropt
she
gives
her
all
to
wither
in
autumnal
woe
there
were
several
low
buildings
to
the
east
of
colonel
hamilton
s
house
where
various
domestic
affairs
were
established
the
last
of
these
had
the
large
spinning
room
in
the
second
story
and
stood
to
the
breezes
here
were
the
wool
and
flax
wheels
and
the
loom
with
all
their
implements
and
here
peggy
reigned
over
her
handmaidens
one
warm
spring
afternoon
with
something
less
than
her
accustomed
severity
she
had
just
been
declaring
in
a
general
way
that
the
idle
clack
of
foolish
tongues
distressed
her
ears
more
than
the
noise
of
the
loom
and
wheels
together
there
was
an
outside
stairway
and
the
coveted
seat
of
the
young
maids
who
were
sewing
was
on
the
broad
doorstep
at
the
stairhead
you
could
look
up
the
wide
fields
to
the
long
row
of
elms
by
general
goodwin
s
and
see
what
might
pass
by
on
the
portsmouth
road
you
could
also
command
the
long
green
lane
that
led
downhill
toward
the
great
house
also
the
shipyard
and
beyond
that
a
long
stretch
of
the
river
itself
a
young
man
must
be
wary
in
his
approach
who
was
not
descried
afar
by
the
sentinels
of
this
pretty
garrison
on
a
perfectly
silent
afternoon
in
may
the
whole
world
clouds
and
all
appeared
to
be
fast
asleep
but
something
might
happen
at
any
moment
and
it
behooved
hannah
neal
and
phebe
hodgdon
to
be
on
the
watch
they
sat
side
by
side
on
the
doorstep
each
reluctantly
a
new
linen
sheet
two
other
girls
were
spinning
flax
within
the
room
and
old
peggy
herself
was
at
the
loom
weaving
with
steady
diligence
as
she
sat
there
treading
and
reaching
at
her
work
with
quick
of
the
shuttle
and
a
fine
persistence
of
awkward
energy
she
could
look
across
the
river
to
madam
wallingford
s
house
with
its
high
elms
and
rows
of
shuttered
windows
between
her
heart
and
old
susan
s
there
was
a
bond
of
lifelong
friendship
they
seldom
met
owing
to
their
respective
responsibilities
they
even
went
to
different
places
of
worship
on
sunday
but
they
always
took
a
vast
and
silent
comfort
in
watching
for
each
other
s
light
at
night
it
was
peggy
s
habit
to
sing
softly
at
her
work
once
in
a
while
in
her
gentlest
mood
she
chanted
aloud
a
snatch
of
some
old
song
there
was
never
but
one
song
for
a
day
to
be
repeated
over
and
over
and
the
better
she
was
pleased
with
her
conditions
the
sadder
was
her
strain
now
and
then
her
old
voice
weak
and
uncertain
but
still
unexpectedly
beautiful
came
back
again
so
clear
and
true
that
the
chattering
girls
themselves
were
hushed
into
listening
the
peace
in
her
heart
was
such
that
she
had
been
singing
over
and
over
with
plaintive
cadences
a
most
mournful
quatrain
of
ancient
lines
set
to
a
still
more
ancient
tune
it
must
have
touched
the
chords
of
some
inherited
memory
o
death
rock
me
asleep
sang
peggy
dolefully
o
death
rock
me
asleep
bring
me
to
quiet
rest
let
pass
my
weary
guiltless
ghost
out
of
my
breast
the
girls
had
seldom
heard
their
old
tyrant
forget
herself
and
them
so
completely
in
her
singing
they
gave
each
other
a
sympathetic
glance
as
she
continued
the
noisy
shuttle
subdued
itself
to
the
time
and
tune
and
made
a
rude
accompaniment
one
might
have
the
same
feeling
in
listening
to
a
thrush
at
nightfall
as
to
such
a
natural
song
as
this
at
last
the
poignancy
of
feeling
grew
too
great
for
even
the
singer
herself
and
she
drew
away
from
the
spell
of
the
music
as
if
she
approached
too
near
the
sad
reality
of
its
first
occasion
my
grandmother
was
said
to
have
the
best
voice
in
these
piscataqua
plantations
when
she
was
young
announced
peggy
with
the
tone
of
a
friend
my
mother
had
a
pretty
voice
too
but
t
was
a
small
voice
like
mine
i
m
good
as
dumb
beside
either
of
them
but
there
is
n
t
no
tune
i
ever
heard
that
i
can
t
follow
in
my
own
head
as
true
as
a
bird
this
one
was
a
verse
my
grandmother
knew
days
i
think
she
sings
right
on
inside
of
me
i
forget
the
story
of
the
song
she
knew
the
old
story
of
everything
peggy
was
modest
but
she
had
held
her
audience
for
once
and
knew
it
she
stopped
to
tie
a
careful
weaver
s
knot
in
the
warp
and
adjust
some
difficulty
of
her
pattern
hitty
warren
who
was
spinning
by
the
door
trilled
out
a
gay
strain
as
if
by
way
of
relief
to
the
gloom
of
a
song
which
however
moving
and
beautiful
could
not
fail
to
make
the
heart
grow
sad
i
have
a
house
and
lands
in
kent
protested
hitty
s
light
young
caroling
voice
and
if
you
ll
love
me
love
me
now
two
pence
ha
penny
is
my
rent
and
i
can
not
come
every
day
to
woo
whereupon
hannah
neal
and
phebe
who
sang
a
capital
clear
second
joined
in
with
approval
and
alacrity
to
sing
the
chorus
two
pence
ha
penny
is
his
rent
and
he
can
not
come
every
day
to
woo
they
kept
it
going
over
and
over
like
blackbirds
and
peggy
clacked
her
shuttle
in
time
to
this
measure
but
she
did
not
offer
to
join
them
perhaps
she
had
felt
some
dim
foreboding
that
her
own
song
comforted
the
air
had
suddenly
grown
full
of
calls
and
cries
as
if
there
were
some
subtle
disturbance
the
birds
were
in
busy
flight
and
one
could
hear
faint
shouts
from
the
old
vineyard
and
the
neighboring
falls
where
men
and
boys
were
at
the
salmon
fishing
at
last
the
girls
were
done
singing
they
had
called
no
audience
out
of
the
empty
green
fields
they
began
to
lag
in
their
work
and
sat
whispering
and
chuckling
a
little
about
their
own
affairs
peggy
stopped
the
loom
and
regarded
them
angrily
but
they
took
no
notice
all
four
had
their
heads
close
together
now
over
a
piece
of
gossip
she
turned
on
her
narrow
perch
and
faced
them
their
young
hands
were
idle
in
their
laps
go
to
your
wheel
hitty
warren
and
to
your
work
the
pack
of
you
i
begretch
the
time
you
waste
and
the
meals
you
eat
in
laziness
you
foolish
hussies
cried
peggy
with
distinctness
look
at
the
house
so
short
of
both
sheeting
and
table
gear
since
the
colonel
took
his
great
boatload
of
what
we
had
in
use
to
send
to
the
army
if
it
wa
n
t
for
me
having
forethought
to
hide
a
couple
o
heaping
armfuls
of
our
best
russian
for
the
canopy
beds
we
d
been
bare
enough
and
had
to
content
the
gentlefolk
with
unbleached
webs
and
all
our
grand
holland
sheets
only
in
wear
four
years
and
just
coming
to
their
softness
all
gone
now
to
be
torn
in
strips
for
them
that
s
wounded
all
spoilt
like
common
workhouse
stuff
for
those
that
never
slept
out
o
their
own
clothes
t
was
a
sad
waste
but
we
must
work
hard
now
to
plenish
us
she
gravely
reproached
them
miss
mary
is
as
bad
as
the
colonel
insisted
hannah
neal
the
more
demure
of
the
seamstresses
who
had
promptly
fallen
to
work
again
the
handsome
master
of
the
house
could
do
no
wrong
in
the
eyes
of
his
admiring
maids
they
missed
his
kind
and
serious
face
eyen
if
sometimes
he
did
not
speak
or
look
when
he
passed
them
at
their
sewing
or
churning
a
man
knows
nowt
o
linen
he
might
think
a
gre
t
sheet
like
this
sewed
its
whole
long
self
together
said
phebe
hodgdon
ruefully
as
she
pushed
a
slow
needle
through
the
hard
selvages
to
work
with
ye
commanded
peggy
more
firmly
my
eye
s
upon
ye
and
hitty
sighed
loud
and
drearily
the
afternoon
sun
was
hot
in
the
spinning
room
and
the
loom
began
its
incessant
noise
again
at
that
moment
the
girls
on
the
doorstep
cheerfully
took
notice
of
two
manly
figures
that
were
coming
quickly
along
the
footpath
of
the
spring
pasture
next
above
the
hamilton
lands
on
the
riverside
they
stooped
to
drink
at
the
spring
in
the
pasture
corner
and
came
on
together
until
one
of
them
stood
still
and
gave
a
loud
cry
the
two
sewing
girls
beckoned
their
friends
of
the
spinning
to
behold
this
pleasing
sight
perhaps
some
of
the
lads
they
knew
were
on
their
way
from
the
upper
landing
to
pound
hill
farms
these
river
footpaths
had
already
won
some
of
the
rights
of
immemorial
usage
and
many
foot
travelers
passed
by
hamilton
s
to
the
lower
part
of
the
town
a
man
could
go
on
foot
to
rice
s
ferry
through
such
byways
across
field
and
pasture
as
fast
as
a
fleet
horse
could
travel
by
the
winding
old
portsmouth
road
the
two
hurrying
figures
were
strangers
and
they
came
to
the
knoll
above
the
shipyard
they
were
both
waving
their
hats
now
and
shouting
to
the
few
old
men
at
work
below
on
the
river
bank
peggy
was
only
aware
of
a
daring
persistence
in
idleness
and
again
began
to
chide
just
as
the
eager
girls
dropped
their
work
and
clattered
down
the
outer
stair
and
left
her
bereft
of
any
audience
at
all
she
hurried
to
the
door
in
time
to
see
their
petticoats
flutter
away
and
then
herself
caught
sight
of
the
excited
messengers
there
was
a
noise
of
voices
in
the
distance
and
workmen
from
the
wharves
and
warehouses
were
running
up
the
green
slopes
there
s
news
come
exclaimed
peggy
forgetting
her
own
weaving
as
she
stumbled
over
the
pile
of
new
linen
on
the
stair
landing
and
hurried
after
the
girls
news
was
apt
to
come
up
the
river
rather
than
down
but
there
was
no
time
to
consider
some
ill
might
have
befallen
colonel
hamilton
himself
had
been
long
enough
away
and
the
day
before
there
had
been
rumors
of
great
battles
to
the
southward
in
new
jersey
the
messengers
stood
side
by
side
with
an
air
of
importance
our
side
have
beat
the
british
but
there
s
a
mort
o
men
killed
and
taken
john
ricker
s
dead
and
john
marr
and
billy
lord
s
among
the
missing
and
young
hodgdon
s
dead
the
widow
s
son
and
there
s
word
come
to
dover
that
the
ranger
has
made
awful
havoc
along
the
british
coast
and
sent
a
fortin
o
prizes
back
to
france
there
s
trouble
mongst
her
crew
and
young
wallingford
s
deserted
after
he
done
his
best
to
betray
the
ship
the
heralds
recited
their
tale
as
they
had
told
it
over
and
over
at
every
for
miles
back
prompting
each
other
at
every
sentence
from
unseen
sources
a
surprising
crowd
of
men
and
women
had
suddenly
gathered
about
them
some
of
these
wept
aloud
now
and
others
shouted
their
eager
questions
louder
and
louder
it
was
like
a
tiny
babel
that
had
been
brought
together
by
a
whirlwind
out
of
the
quiet
air
they
say
wallingford
s
tried
to
give
the
ranger
into
the
enemy
s
hands
and
got
captured
for
his
pains
some
thinks
they
ve
hung
him
for
a
spy
he
s
been
watching
his
chance
all
along
to
play
the
traitor
said
one
triumphantly
as
if
he
had
kept
the
best
news
till
the
last
t
is
false
cried
a
clear
young
voice
behind
them
they
turned
to
front
the
unexpected
presence
of
miss
hamilton
who
dared
to
say
this
she
stood
a
little
beyond
the
crowd
and
looked
with
blazing
eyes
straight
at
the
two
flushed
faces
of
the
rustic
heralds
go
tell
your
sad
news
if
you
must
she
said
sternly
but
do
not
repeat
that
roger
wallingford
is
a
traitor
to
his
oath
we
must
all
know
him
better
who
have
known
him
at
all
he
may
have
met
misfortune
at
the
hand
of
god
but
the
crime
of
treachery
has
not
been
his
and
you
should
know
it
who
speak
and
every
man
here
who
listens
there
fell
a
silence
upon
the
company
but
when
the
young
mistress
turned
away
there
rose
a
murmur
of
applause
old
peggy
hastened
to
her
side
but
miss
hamilton
waved
her
back
and
with
drooping
head
and
a
white
face
went
on
slowly
and
passed
alone
into
the
great
house
the
messengers
were
impatient
to
go
their
ways
among
the
old
fields
farms
and
went
hurrying
down
toward
the
brook
and
round
the
head
of
the
cove
and
up
the
hill
again
through
the
oak
pasture
toward
the
houses
at
pound
hill
they
were
followed
along
the
footpath
by
men
and
boys
and
women
too
who
were
eager
to
see
how
the
people
there
old
widow
ricker
especially
would
take
the
news
of
a
son
s
captivity
or
death
the
very
torch
of
war
seemed
to
flame
along
the
footpath
on
that
spring
afternoon
the
makers
of
the
linen
sheets
might
have
been
the
sewers
of
a
shroud
as
they
came
ruefully
back
to
their
places
by
the
door
and
let
the
salt
tears
down
fall
upon
their
unwilling
seams
poor
billy
lord
and
humphrey
hodgdon
were
old
friends
and
corporal
ricker
was
a
handsome
man
and
the
gallant
leader
of
many
a
the
clack
of
peggy
s
shuttle
sounded
like
the
ticking
clock
of
fate
my
god
my
god
said
the
old
woman
who
had
driven
the
weeping
maids
so
heartlessly
to
their
work
again
the
slow
tears
of
age
were
blinding
her
own
eyes
she
could
not
see
to
weave
and
must
fain
yield
herself
to
idleness
those
poor
boys
gone
and
madam
s
son
a
prisoner
or
worse
in
england
she
looked
at
the
house
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
dark
and
sombre
against
the
bright
sky
i
ll
go
and
send
miss
mary
over
she
should
be
there
now
i
ll
go
myself
over
to
susan
fold
up
your
stents
for
me
i
can
weave
no
more
she
said
sorrowfully
t
is
like
the
day
of
a
funeral
and
the
maids
still
weeping
put
their
linen
by
and
stood
the
two
flax
wheels
in
their
places
back
against
the
wall
takes
the
and
now
that
an
quietnes
should
seem
to
strew
the
house
that
evening
in
hamilton
house
mary
felt
like
a
creature
caged
against
its
will
she
was
full
of
fears
for
others
and
reproaches
for
herself
and
went
restlessly
from
window
to
window
and
from
room
to
room
there
was
no
doubt
that
a
great
crisis
had
come
the
may
sun
set
among
heavy
clouds
and
the
large
rooms
grew
dim
and
chilly
the
house
was
silent
but
on
the
river
shores
there
were
groups
of
men
and
boys
gathering
and
now
and
then
strange
figures
appeared
as
if
the
news
had
brought
them
hastily
from
a
distance
peggy
had
gone
early
across
the
river
and
now
returned
late
from
her
friendly
errand
dressed
in
a
prim
bonnet
and
cloak
that
were
made
for
sunday
wear
and
gave
her
the
look
of
a
dignitary
in
humble
disguise
so
used
to
command
was
she
and
so
equipped
by
nature
for
the
rule
of
others
illustration
hamilton
house
peggy
found
her
young
mistress
white
and
wan
in
the
northwest
parlor
and
knew
that
she
had
been
anxiously
watching
madam
wallingford
s
house
she
turned
as
the
old
housekeeper
came
in
and
listened
with
patience
as
with
rare
tact
this
good
creature
avoided
the
immediate
subject
of
their
thoughts
and
at
first
proceeded
to
blame
the
maids
for
running
out
and
leaving
the
doors
flying
when
she
had
bidden
them
mind
the
house
the
twilight
lasts
very
late
you
have
been
long
away
said
mary
when
she
had
finished
t
is
a
night
and
all
the
sky
is
lit
exclaimed
peggy
seriously
it
will
soon
be
dark
enough
then
she
came
close
to
mary
and
began
to
whisper
what
she
really
had
to
say
t
is
the
only
thing
to
do
as
you
told
me
before
i
went
cæsar
abased
himself
to
row
me
over
and
took
time
enough
about
it
i
vowed
him
i
thought
once
he
d
fetched
himself
to
the
door
of
an
apoplexy
he
puffed
an
blowed
so
hard
but
i
quick
found
out
what
was
in
his
piecemeal
mind
before
i
heared
folks
talking
on
t
other
bank
the
great
fightin
folks
that
stayed
at
home
from
the
war
is
all
ablaze
against
roger

have
no
such
a
tory

i
in
my
mind
and
i
wrung
my
hands

of

tears

emphatic
approval

mary
impatiently
cæsar
is
a
good
man
but
he
is
only
one
what
shall
we
do
now
her
voice
was
full
of
quivering
appeal
she
had
been
long
alone
with
her
distressful
thoughts
peggy
s
cheeks
looked
pink
as
a
girl
s
in
her
deep
bonnet
and
her
old
eyes
glittered
with
excitement
you
must
go
straight
away
and
fetch
madam

she
said
i
d
brought
her
back
with
me
if

peggy
in
a
fury
i
did

men

they
believed

to
porchmouth
a
ready
and
when
they
axed
me
if
t
was
true
i
nodded
my
head
and
let
em
think
so
mary
listened
silently
this
excited
talk
made
her
know
the
truth
of
some
danger
she
herself
had
a
part
to
play
now
i
shall

once
she
insisted

there
to

there

our

ready
to

ere

she
muttered
to
herself
i
wonder
if
she
will
consent
to
come
she
is
a
very
brave
woman
said
mary
doubtfully
darlin
listen
to
me
she
must
come
replied
peggy
an
you
must
tell
her
so
you
do
your
part
an
i
ll
be
waitin
here
till
you
get
back
the
large
boat
which
was
hamilton
s
river
coach
and
four
in
peaceful
times
lay
waiting
in
the
shadow
of
the
warehouse
to
do
its
errand
the
pairs
of
rowers
were
in
their
places
peggy
may
have
had
a
sage
desire
to
keep
them
out
of
mischief
they
were
not
a
vigorous
crew
by
reason
of
age
else
they
would
have
been
like
other
good
men
with
the
army
with
her
usual
sense
of
propriety
and
effect
peggy
had
ordered
out
the
best
red
cushions
and
tasseled
draperies
for
the
seats
in
summer
the
best
boat
spread
a
fine
red
and
green
canopy
when
it
carried
the
master
and
mistress
down
to
portsmouth
on
the
ebb
tide
the
old
boatmen
had
mounted
their
liveries
such
was
peggy
s
insistence
and
unaccountable
desire
for
display
but
a
plainer
craft
rowed
by
a
single
pair
of
oars
was
enough
for
any
errand
at
nightfall
and
the
old
fellows
grumbled
and
shivered
ostentatiously
in
the
spring
dampness
old
cæsar
handed
miss
hamilton
to
her
seat
with
all
the
more
deference
she
was
wrapped
in
a
cloak
of
crimson
damask
with
a
hood
to
it
which
her
brother
loved
to
see
her
wear
in
their
gayer
days
she
took
her
place
silently
in
the
stern
and
sat
erect
there
the
men
stole
a
glance
at
her
now
and
then
and
tugged
willingly
enough
at
their
oars
there
were
many
persons
watching
them
as
they
went
up
the
stream
t
will
be
a
hard
pinch
to
land
ye
proper
at
the
upper
wharves
said
the
head
boatman
the
tide
s
far
out
miss
i
go
to
madam
wallingford
s
said
mary
and
in
the
dusk
she
saw
them
cast
sidewise
glances
at
each
other
while
their
oars
lost
stroke
and
fouled
they
had
thought
it
lucky
that
there
should
be
a
card
party
and
their
young
mistress
out
of
sight
and
hearing
if
the
threats
meant
anything
and
there
should
be
trouble
that
night
alongshore
miss
hamilton
said
nothing
further
was
usually
most
friendly
in
her
speech
with
these
old
servants
but
she
thanked
them
in
a
gentle
tone
as
she
landed
and
bade
them
be
ready
at
any
moment
for
her
return
they
looked
at
her
with
wonder
and
swore
under
their
breath
for
mere
astonishment
as
she
disappeared
from
their
sight
with
hurrying
steps
along
the
winding
way
that
led
up
to
the
large
house
on
the
hill
as
mary
passed
the
old
boathouse
and
again
as
she
came
near
the
storehouses
just
beyond
she
could
see
shadowy
moving
figures
like
ghosts
that
were
gone
again
in
an
instant
out
of
sight
crouching
to
the
ground
or
dodging
behind
the
buildings
as
they
saw
her
pass
once
she
heard
a
voice
close
under
the
bank
below
the
road
but
it
ceased
suddenly
as
if
some
one
had
given
warning
every
dark
corner
was
a
hiding
place
but
the
girl
felt
no
fear
now
there
was
something
to
be
done
there
was
no
light
in
the
lower
story
of
the
great
house
but
in
madam
wallingford
s
chamber
the
firelight
was
shining
and
by
turns
it
darkened
and
brightened
the
windows
for
the
first
time
mary
felt
weak
at
heart
but
there
was
that
within
her
which
could
drive
out
all
fear
or
sense
of
danger
as
she
stood
on
the
broad
doorsteps
waiting
and
looking
riverward
she
smiled
to
see
that
peggy
had
lighted
their
own
house
as
if
for
some
high
festival
it
had
a
look
of
cheerfulness
and
security
there
beyond
the
elms
she
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
that
was
like
a
first
acknowledgment
of
fear
she
did
not
remember
that
one
person
might
have
come
safely
from
the
boat
where
two
could
not
go
back
again
she
struck
the
heavy
knocker
and
this
time
heard
rodney
s
anxious
voice
within
whispering
to
ask
whether
she
were
friend
or
foe
before
he
timidly
unbarred
the
door
they
tell
me
there
is
some
danger
of
a
mob
my
child
madam
wallingford
spoke
calmly
as
if
this
were
some
ordinary
news
mary
had
found
her
sitting
by
the
fire
and
kissed
her
cheek
without
speaking
the
room
was
so
quiet
and
its
lady
looked
so
frail
and
patient
unconscious
that
danger
already
hemmed
them
in
on
every
side
i
fear
that
this
house
may
be
burnt
and
robbed
like
the
salem
houses
she
said
poor
rodney
and
the
women
are
afraid
too
i
saw
that
they
were
in
a
great
fright
and
forced
the
truth
from
them
i
think
my
troubles
have
robbed
me
of
all
my
strength
i
do
not
know
what
i
must
do
i
feel
very
old
mary
and
my
strength
fails
me
she
faltered
i
need
my
i
have
had
dreadful
news
i
have
come
to
take
you
home
with
me
dear
answered
mary
come
i
shall
wrap
you
in
my
warm
red
cloak
the
night
is
chilly
these
are
peggy
s
orders
and
we
must
follow
them
she
would
not
have
you
frighted
ever
so
little
if
there
is
any
danger
she
is
making
you
some
hot
drink
this
very
minute
and
i
have
brought
our
steady
boat
with
the
four
old
rowers
they
are
waiting
for
us
below
good
peggy
exclaimed
madam
wallingford
who
saw
the
bright
smile
that
lighted
mary
s
face
and
was
now
rallying
all
her
forces
she
was
here
herself
this
afternoon
i
wish
that
i
had
seen
her
we
shall
not
obey
her
this
once
you
see
that
i
can
not
go
if
there
is
an
attack
i
must
be
here
to
meet
it
men
may
hear
to
reason
if
there
is
no
real
danger
i
am
safe
to
stay
and
she
cast
a
fond
look
about
the
room
mary
saw
it
with
compassion
at
the
same
moment
she
heard
cries
outside
as
if
some
fresh
recruits
were
welcomed
to
the
gathering
fray
my
safety
and
the
safety
of
our
house
lies
in
my
staying
here
said
the
lady
sitting
straight
in
her
great
chair
i
am
not
easily
made
afraid
it
is
only
that
my
strength
failed
me
at
the
first
if
god
sends
ruin
and
death
this
night
i
can
but
meet
it
i
shall
not
go
away
you
were
a
dear
child
to
come
you
must
make
my
kind
excuses
to
peggy
go
now
my
dear
and
rodney
shall
put
you
in
your
boat
there
was
a
proud
look
on
madam
wallingford
s
face
as
she
spoke
i
shall
stay
with
you
answered
mary
alas
i
think
it
is
too
late
for
either
of
us
to
go
she
added
as
her
quick
ears
were
aware
of
strange
noises
without
the
house
there
was
a
sharp
rapping
sound
of
stones
striking
the
walls
and
a
pane
of
glass
fell
shattering
into
the
room
in
salem
they
took
an
old
man
from
his
dying
bed
and
destroyed
his
habitation
he
had
been
a
judge
and
a
good
citizen
if
these
be
our
own
neighbors
who
think
me
dangerous
i
must
follow
their
bidding
if
they
are
strangers
we
must
be
in
danger
i
wish
that
you
had
not
come
mary
mary
was
already
at
the
window
the
shutters
were
pushed
back
and
the
sweet
night
air
blew
through
the
broken
pane
upon
her
face
the
heavy
sliding
shutter
caught
as
she
tried
to
stir
it
and
she
saw
that
the
moving
crowd
had
come
close
about
the
house
at
the
sight
of
her
they
gave
an
angry
roar
there
were
musket
shots
and
a
great
racket
of
noise
come
out
come
out
they
cried
and
take
the
oath
so
the
mob
has
come
already
said
madam
wallingford
calmly
and
rose
from
her
seat
then
i
must
go
down
is
it
a
great
company
i
could
not
have
believed
so
many
men
were
left
answered
mary
bitterly
they
should
be
fighting
other
battles
she
protested
trembling
with
sudden
rage
where
go
you
madam
for
madam
wallingford
was
hurrying
from
the
room
as
she
threw
open
the
door
all
the
frightened
people
of
the
household
were
huddled
close
outside
they
fell
upon
their
knees
about
her
and
burst
into
loud
lamentations
they
pressed
as
near
their
mistress
as
they
could
it
was
old
rodney
and
susan
who
had
kept
the
others
from
bursting
into
the
room
silence
among
ye
said
madam
wallingford
i
shall
do
what
i
can
my
poor
people
i
am
going
down
to
speak
to
these
foolish
men
they
have
come
to
rob
us
and
murder
us
wailed
the
women
rodney
you
will
go
before
me
and
unbar
the
door
commanded
the
mistress
susan
shall
stay
here
quiet
this
childishness
i
would
not
have
such
people
as
these
think
that
we
lack
courage
she
went
down
the
wide
staircase
as
if
she
were
a
queen
and
mary
her
maid
of
honor
rodney
was
for
hanging
back
from
those
who
pounded
to
demand
entrance
and
needed
an
angry
gesture
before
he
took
the
great
bar
down
and
flung
the
door
wide
open
then
madam
wallingford
stepped
forward
as
if
to
greet
her
guests
with
dignity
and
mary
was
only
a
step
behind
there
was
a
bonfire
lit
before
the
house
and
all
the
portraits
along
the
paneled
hall
seemed
to
come
alive
in
the
blazing
light
that
shone
in
and
to
stand
behind
the
two
women
like
a
guard
what
do
you
wish
to
say
to
me
asked
madam
wallingford
the
oath
the
oath
they
cried
or
get
you
hence
and
there
was
a
shaking
of
firebrands
and
the
heads
pressed
closer
about
the
door
you
are
sons
of
liberty
and
yet
you
forbid
liberty
to
others
said
the
old
gentlewoman
in
her
clear
voice
i
have
wronged
none
of
you
for
very
sight
of
her
age
and
bravery
and
because
she
was
so
great
a
lady
they
fell
silent
and
then
a
heavy
stone
thrown
from
the
edge
of
the
crowd
struck
the
lintel
of
the
door
beside
her
is
there
no
man
among
you
whom
you
will
choose
to
speak
fairly
with
me
to
tell
your
errand
and
whence
you
come
we
are
some
of
us
from
christian
shore
and
some
are
dover
men
and
some
of
us
are
men
of
your
own
town
answered
a
pale
elderly
man
with
the
face
of
a
fanatic
he
had
been
a
preacher
of
wild
doctrines
in
the
countryside
and
was
ever
a
disturber
of
peace
we
want
no
royalists
among
us
we
want
no
abettors
of
george
the
third
there
s
a
bill
now
to
proscribe
ye
and
stop
your
luxury
and
pride
we
want
no
traitors
and
spies
neither
to
betray
the
cause
of
the
oppressed
you
and
your
son
have
played
a
deep
game
he
has
betrayed
our
cause
and
the
penalty
must
fall
there
was
a
shout
of
approval
the
mob
was
only
too
ready
to
pour
into
the
house
my
son
has
put
his
name
to
your
oath
and
you
should
know
that
he
has
not
broken
it
if
some
of
you
are
indeed
men
of
our
own
town
said
the
mother
proudly
and
they
all
heard
her
speak
i
can
promise
that
this
is
true
can
not
you
wait
to
hear
the
truth
about
him
or
is
it
only
to
rob
us
and
make
a
night
of
revel
you
have
come
do
not
pay
sin
with
sin
if
you
must
hold
those
to
be
sinners
who
are
loyalists
like
me
burn
the
old
nest
cried
an
impatient
voice
she
may
be
hiding
some
king
s
men
knows
stop
her
prating
and
let
s
to
business
we
are
done
with
their
royalties
and
the
crowd
pushed
hard
they
forced
the
two
women
and
old
rodney
back
into
the
hall
and
at
the
sound
of
heavy
trampling
all
the
women
on
the
stair
above
fell
to
shrieking
mary
put
herself
before
madam
wallingford
for
safety
s
sake
and
held
up
her
hand
stop
stop
she
begged
them
let
me
first
take
my
friend
away
i
am
mary
hamilton
of
the
patriots
and
you
all
know
my
brother
i
ask
you
in
his
name
to
let
us
go
in
peace
her
sorrowful
face
and
her
beauty
for
one
instant
held
some
of
them
irresolute
but
from
the
back
of
the
crowd
a
great
pressure
urged
the
rest
forward
there
was
a
little
hush
and
one
man
cried
yes
let
them
go
but
the
wild
and
lawless
who
were
for
crowding
in
would
not
have
it
so
it
was
a
terrible
moment
like
the
sight
of
coming
death
there
was
a
crash
the
women
were
overpowered
and
flung
back
against
the
wall
suddenly
there
was
a
new
confusion
a
heavier
din
and
some
unexpected
obstacle
to
this
onset
all
at
once
a
loud
familiar
voice
went
to
mary
s
heart
she
was
crouching
with
her
arms
close
about
her
old
friend
to
shield
her
from
bruises
and
rough
handling
as
the
men
pushed
by
in
the
same
moment
there
were
loud
outcries
of
alarm
without
what
happened
next
in
the
hall
seemed
like
the
hand
of
heaven
upon
their
enemies
old
major
tilly
haggens
was
there
in
the
midst
with
friends
behind
him
dealing
stout
blows
among
those
who
would
sack
the
house
outside
on
their
horses
were
judge
chadbourne
and
general
goodwin
who
had
ridden
straight
into
the
mob
and
with
them
a
little
troop
of
such
authorities
as
could
be
gathered
constables
and
tithing
men
and
old
elder
shackley
in
his
scarlet
cloak
parson
pike
and
rollins
his
chief
parishioner
were
all
there
together
they
rode
among
the
brawling
men
as
if
they
were
but
bushes
and
turned
their
good
horses
before
the
house
the
crowd
quick
lost
its
solid
look
it
now
had
to
confront
those
who
were
not
defenseless
we
are
patriots
and
sons
of
liberty
all
of
us
who
are
here
shouted
the
minister
in
a
fine
clear
voice
we
are
none
of
us
old
or
young
for
the
king
but
we
will
not
see
a
christian
woman
and
kind
neighbor
made
to
suffer
in
such
wise
as
this
nor
shall
you
do
vengeance
upon
her
son
until
there
is
final
proof
of
his
guilt
we
can
beat
these
old
parsons
shouted
an
angry
voice
to
it
lads
we
are
three
to
their
one
but
the
elderly
men
on
horseback
held
their
own
most
of
them
were
taught
in
the
old
school
of
fighting
and
had
their
ancient
swords
well
in
hand
ready
for
use
with
all
manly
courage
major
tilly
haggens
still
fought
as
a
foot
soldier
in
the
hall
his
famous
iron
fist
was
doing
work
worthy
of
those
younger
days
when
he
was
called
the
best
boxer
and
wrestler
in
the
plantations
he
came
forth
now
sweeping
the
most
persistent
before
him
out
of
the
house
i
ll
learn
ye
to
strike
a
poor
lame
old
man
like
me
ye
are
no
honest
patriots
but
a
pack
of
thieves
and
blackguards
the
worst
pest
of
these
colonies
he
cried
with
sound
blows
to
right
and
left
for
emphasis
he
laid
out
one
foe
after
another
on
the
soft
grass
as
on
a
bed
until
there
was
no
one
left
to
vanquish
and
his
own
scant
breath
had
nearly
left
his
body
the
trampling
horses
had
helped
their
riders
work
and
were
now
for
neighing
and
rearing
and
taking
to
their
heels
the
town
constable
was
bawling
his
official
threats
as
he
held
one
of
the
weaker
assailants
by
the
collar
and
pounded
the
poor
repentant
creature
s
back
it
had
suddenly
turned
to
a
scene
of
plain
comedy
and
the
mob
was
nothing
but
a
rabble
of
men
and
boys
all
running
for
shelter
such
as
could
still
run
and
disappearing
down
toward
the
river
shore
the
old
judge
got
stiffly
from
his
tall
narragansett
pacer
and
came
into
the
hall
madam
wallingford
s
friends
stop
here
he
told
the
old
servant
who
appeared
from
some
dark
corner
poor
rodney
was
changed
to
such
an
ashen
color
that
he
looked
very
strange
and
as
if
he
had
rubbed
phosphorus
to
his
frightened
eyes
you
may
tell
your
mistress
and
miss
hamilton
that
there
is
no
more
danger
for
the
present
added
the
judge
i
shall
set
a
watch
about
the
house
till
daylight
major
haggens
was
panting
for
breath
and
leaned
his
great
weight
heavily
against
the
wainscoting
i
am
near
an
apoplexy
he
groaned
faintly
rodney
i
hope
i
killed
some
of
those
divils
you
may
fetch
me
a
little
water
and
qualify
it
with
some
of
madam
s
french
brandy
of
the
paler
sort
stay
you
can
help
me
get
to
the
dining
parlor
myself
and
i
ll
consider
the
too
violent
a
portion
would
be
my
death
t
would
make
a
poor
angel
of
me
rodney
early
in
the
morning
judge
chadbourne
and
his
neighbor
squire
hill
a
wise
and
prudent
man
went
out
to
take
the
morning
air
before
the
house
they
were
presently
summoned
by
madam
wallingford
and
spoke
with
her
in
her
chamber
the
broken
glass
of
the
window
still
glittered
on
the
floor
even
at
sunrise
the
day
was
so
mild
that
there
was
no
chill
but
the
guests
were
struck
by
something
desolate
in
the
room
even
before
they
caught
sight
of
their
lady
s
face
i
must
go
away
my
good
friends
she
declared
quietly
after
she
had
thanked
them
for
their
service
i
must
not
put
my
friends
in
peril
she
said
but
i
am
sure
of
your
kind
advice
in
my
sad
situation
we
wait
upon
you
to
say
that
it
would
be
best
madam
said
the
judge
plainly
i
hear
that
new
hampshire
as
well
as
massachusetts
has
in
consideration
an
act
of
great
severity
against
the
presence
or
return
of
loyalists
and
i
fear
that
you
would
run
too
much
risk
by
staying
here
if
you
should
be
proscribed
and
your
estates
confiscated
as
i
fear
may
be
done
in
any
case
you
are
putting
your
son
s
welfare
in
peril
as
well
as
your
own
if
he
be
still
living
now
though
misfortunes
have
overtaken
him
and
he
has
kept
faith
as
we
who
know
him
must
still
believe
these
estates
which
you
hold
for
him
in
trust
are
not
in
danger
if
the
facts
are
otherwise
the
old
justice
looked
at
her
but
could
not
find
it
in
his
heart
to
go
on
madam
wallingford
sat
pondering
the
matter
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
his
face
and
was
for
some
time
lost
in
the
gravest
thoughts
what
is
this
oath
she
asked
at
last
and
her
cheeks
whitened
as
she
put
the
question
the
judge
turned
to
hill
and
without
speaking
that
gentleman
took
a
folded
paper
from
among
some
documents
which
he
wore
in
his
pocket
and
rose
to
hand
it
to
the
lady
will
you
read
it
to
me
she
asked
again
and
he
read
the
familiar
oath
of
allegiance
in
a
steady
voice
and
not
without
approval
in
his
tone
i
do
acknowledge
the
united
states
of
america
to
be
free
independent
and
sovereign
states
and
declare
that
the
people
thereof
owe
no
allegiance
or
obedience
to
george
the
third
king
of
great
britain
and
i
renounce
refuse
and
abjure
any
allegiance
or
obedience
to
him
and
i
do
swear
that
i
will
to
the
utmost
of
my
power
support
maintain
and
defend
the
said
united
states
against
the
said
king
george
the
third
his
heirs
and
successors
and
his
or
their
abettors
assistants
and
adherents
and
will
serve
the
said
united
states
in
the
office
which
i
now
hold
with
fidelity
according
to
the
best
of
my
skill
and
understanding
as
he
finished
he
looked
at
the
listener
for
assent
as
was
his
habit
and
judge
chadbourne
half
rose
in
his
eagerness
everything
was
so
simple
and
so
easy
if
she
would
take
the
oath
she
was
but
a
woman
oath
was
made
for
men
but
she
was
a
great
land
holder
and
all
the
country
looked
to
her
she
was
the
almoner
of
her
own
wealth
and
her
husband
s
and
it
were
better
if
she
stood
here
in
her
lot
and
place
i
can
not
sign
this
she
said
abruptly
is
this
the
oath
that
roger
my
son
has
taken
the
same
madam
answered
hill
with
a
disappointed
look
upon
his
face
and
there
was
silence
in
the
room
i
must
make
me
ready
to
go
said
madam
wallingford
at
last
and
the
tears
stood
deep
in
her
eyes
but
if
my
son
gave
his
word
he
will
keep
his
word
i
shall
leave
my
trust
and
all
our
fortunes
in
your
hands
and
you
may
choose
some
worthy
gentlemen
from
this
side
of
the
river
to
stand
with
you
the
papers
must
be
drawn
in
portsmouth
i
shall
send
a
rider
down
at
once
with
a
message
and
by
night
i
shall
be
ready
to
go
myself
to
town
i
must
ask
if
you
and
your
colleagues
will
meet
me
there
at
my
house
you
must
both
carry
my
kind
farewells
to
my
barvick
friends
as
for
me
her
voice
broke
for
the
first
time
i
am
but
a
poor
remainder
of
the
past
that
can
not
stand
against
a
mighty
current
of
change
i
knew
last
night
that
it
would
come
to
this
i
am
an
old
woman
to
be
turned
out
of
my
home
and
yet
i
tell
you
the
truth
that
i
go
gladly
since
the
only
thing
i
can
hope
for
now
is
to
find
my
son
you
see
i
am
grown
frail
and
old
but
there
is
something
in
my
heart
that
makes
me
hope
i
have
no
trace
of
my
son
but
he
was
left
near
to
death
and
must
now
be
among
enemies
by
reason
of
having
been
upon
the
ship
no
no
i
shall
not
sign
your
oath
take
it
away
with
you
good
friends
she
cried
bitterly
then
she
put
out
her
weak
hands
to
them
and
a
pathetic
broken
look
came
upon
her
face
t
was
most
brotherly
what
you
did
for
me
last
night
you
must
thank
the
other
good
men
who
were
with
you
i
ask
your
affectionate
remembrance
in
the
sad
days
that
come
you
shall
never
fail
of
my
prayers
and
so
they
left
her
standing
in
the
early
sunshine
of
her
chamber
and
went
away
sorrowful
an
hour
later
mary
hamilton
came
in
bright
and
young
she
was
dressed
and
ready
to
go
home
and
came
to
stand
by
her
old
friend
who
was
already
at
her
business
with
many
papers
spread
about
mary
my
child
said
madam
wallingford
taking
her
hand
and
trembling
a
little
i
am
going
away
there
is
new
trouble
and
i
have
no
choice
you
must
stay
with
me
this
last
day
and
help
me
i
have
no
one
to
look
to
but
you
but
you
can
look
to
me
dear
lady
mary
spoke
cheerfully
not
understanding
to
the
full
yet
being
sure
that
she
should
fail
in
no
service
there
was
a
noble
pride
of
courage
in
her
heart
a
gratitude
because
they
were
both
safe
and
well
and
the
spring
sun
shining
after
such
a
night
god
gives
nothing
better
than
the
power
to
serve
those
whom
we
love
the
bitterest
pain
is
to
be
useless
to
know
that
we
fail
to
carry
to
their
lives
what
their
dear
presence
brings
to
our
own
mary
laid
her
hand
on
her
friend
s
shoulder
can
i
write
for
you
just
now
she
asked
i
am
going
to
england
explained
madam
wallingford
quietly
judge
chadbourne
and
hill
have
both
told
me
that
i
must
go
away
i
shall
speak
only
of
halifax
to
my
household
but
my
heart
is
full
of
the
thought
of
england
where
i
must
find
my
poor
son
i
should
die
of
even
a
month
s
waiting
and
uncertainty
here
it
seems
a
lifetime
since
the
news
came
yesterday
i
must
go
to
find
roger
all
the
bright
determined
eagerness
forsook
mary
hamilton
s
face
it
was
not
that
the
thought
of
exile
was
new
or
strange
but
this
poor
wistful
figure
before
her
with
its
frayed
thread
of
vitality
and
thin
shoulders
bent
down
as
if
with
a
weight
of
sorrow
seemed
to
forbid
even
the
hard
risks
of
seafaring
the
girl
gave
a
cry
of
protest
as
if
she
felt
the
sharp
pain
of
a
sudden
blow
i
have
always
been
well
enough
on
the
sea
i
do
not
dread
the
voyage
so
much
i
am
a
good
sailor
insisted
madam
wallingford
with
a
smile
as
if
she
must
comfort
a
weaker
heart
than
her
own
my
plans
are
easily
made
as
it
happens
one
of
my
own
vessels
was
about
to
sail
for
west
indian
ports
it
was
thought
a
useless
venture
by
many
but
the
captain
is
an
impatient
soul
and
an
excellent
seaman
he
shall
take
us
to
halifax
susan
and
me
i
thought
at
first
to
go
alone
but
susan
has
been
long
with
me
and
can
be
of
great
use
when
we
are
once
ashore
she
is
in
sad
estate
on
the
ocean
poor
creature
and
when
we
went
last
to
virginia
i
thought
never
to
distress
her
so
much
again
there
was
a
shining
light
on
the
girl
s
face
as
she
listened
i
shall
go
with
you
not
susan
she
said
even
with
her
it
would
be
like
letting
you
go
alone
i
am
strong
and
a
good
sailor
too
we
must
leave
her
here
to
take
care
of
your
house
as
i
shall
leave
peggy
madam
wallingford
looked
at
mary
hamilton
with
deep
love
but
she
lifted
her
hand
forbiddingly
no
no
dear
child
she
whispered
i
shall
not
think
of
it
there
may
be
better
news
said
mary
hopefully
there
will
be
no
news
and
i
grudge
every
hour
that
is
wasted
said
the
mother
with
strange
fretfulness
i
have
friends
in
england
as
you
know
if
i
once
reach
an
english
port
the
way
will
be
easy
when
prison
doors
shut
they
do
not
open
of
themselves
in
these
days
but
i
have
some
friends
in
mind
who
would
have
power
to
help
me
i
shall
take
passage
from
halifax
for
bristol
if
i
can
if
no
better
vessel
offers
i
shall
push
on
in
the
golden
dolphin
rather
than
court
delay
mary
stood
smiling
into
her
face
no
no
my
dear
said
madam
wallingford
again
and
drew
the
girl
closer
i
can
not
let
you
think
of
such
a
thing
your
young
heart
speaks
now
and
not
your
wise
reflection
for
your
brother
s
sake
i
could
not
let
you
go
still
less
for
your
own
it
would
make
you
seem
a
traitor
to
your
cause
you
must
stand
in
your
own
place
my
brother
is
away
with
his
troop
he
begged
me
to
leave
everything
here
and
go
farther
up
the
country
the
burning
of
falmouth
made
him
uneasy
and
ever
since
he
does
not
like
my
staying
alone
in
our
house
insisted
mary
there
is
knowledge
enough
of
the
riches
of
this
river
among
seamen
of
the
english
ports
acknowledged
madam
wallingford
in
portsmouth
there
are
many
friends
of
england
who
will
not
be
molested
though
all
our
leaders
are
gone
still
i
know
that
an
attack
upon
our
region
has
long
been
feared
she
ended
wistfully
i
told
my
brother
that
i
should
not
leave
home
until
there
was
really
such
danger
we
should
always
have
warning
if
the
enemy
came
on
the
coast
if
they
burnt
our
house
or
plundered
it
then
i
should
go
farther
up
the
country
i
told
jack
continued
mary
with
flushing
cheeks
that
i
did
not
mean
to
leave
you
and
he
knew
i
meant
it
but
he
was
impatient
too
i
have
timber
that
will
build
a
hundred
houses
he
answered
me
and
was
as
to
the
house
much
as
he
loves
it
but
i
shall
not
have
one
moment
s
peace
while
i
think
you
are
here
alone
yet
you
must
always
look
to
madam
wallingford
he
said
more
than
once
go
now
my
dear
child
send
me
susan
who
is
no
doubt
dallying
in
the
kitchen
commanded
the
mistress
abruptly
i
must
not
lose
a
minute
of
this
day
you
must
do
as
your
brother
bade
you
but
as
for
doing
the
thing
which
would
vex
him
above
everything
else
can
not
listen
to
more
words
i
see
that
you
are
for
going
home
this
morning
can
you
soon
return
to
me
when
you
have
ordered
your
affairs
you
can
help
me
in
many
small
matters
and
we
shall
be
together
to
the
last
i
could
not
take
you
with
me
darling
she
said
affectionately
t
was
my
love
for
i
ought
to
say
t
was
my
own
poor
tempted
my
heart
for
the
moment
now
we
must
think
of
it
no
more
either
of
us
you
have
no
fellowship
with
those
to
whom
i
go
you
are
no
loyalist
and
she
even
smiled
as
she
spoke
god
bless
you
for
such
dear
kindness
mary
i
think
i
love
you
far
too
much
to
let
you
go
with
me
mary
s
face
was
turned
away
and
she
made
no
answer
then
she
left
her
friend
s
side
wondering
at
the
firm
decision
and
strong
authority
which
had
returned
in
this
time
of
sorrow
and
danger
it
frightened
her
this
flaring
up
of
what
had
seemed
such
a
failing
light
of
life
it
was
perhaps
wasting
to
no
purpose
the
little
strength
that
remained
she
stood
at
the
window
to
look
down
the
river
and
saw
the
trampled
ground
below
it
seemed
as
if
the
last
night
s
peril
were
but
the
peril
of
a
dream
the
were
coming
into
bloom
a
young
not
far
away
was
white
like
a
little
bride
and
the
were
ready
to
follow
their
buds
were
big
and
the
white
petals
showing
it
was
high
water
the
tide
had
just
turned
toward
the
ebb
and
there
were
boats
going
down
the
river
to
portsmouth
in
the
usual
fashion
to
return
with
the
flood
there
was
a
large
gundalow
among
them
with
its
tall
lateen
sail
curved
to
the
morning
breeze
of
late
the
river
had
sometimes
looked
forsaken
so
many
men
were
gone
to
war
and
this
year
the
fields
would
again
be
half
tilled
at
best
by
boys
and
women
to
country
eyes
there
was
a
piteous
lack
of
the
pleasant
hopefulness
of
land
on
the
river
farms
there
are
many
boats
going
down
reported
mary
in
her
usual
tone
they
will
be
for
telling
the
news
of
last
night
at
the
wharves
in
portsmouth
there
will
be
a
fine
busy
crowd
on
the
parade
then
she
sighed
heavily
she
was
in
the
valley
of
decision
she
felt
as
if
she
were
near
to
tearing
herself
from
this
dear
landscape
and
from
home
she
was
on
the
brink
of
a
great
change
she
could
not
but
shrink
from
such
a
change
and
loss
she
returned
from
her
outlook
to
madam
wallingford
s
side
i
must
not
interrupt
your
business
i
will
not
press
you
either
against
your
will
i
shall
soon
come
back
and
then
you
will
let
me
help
you
and
stay
with
you
as
you
said
when
will
your
brig
be
ready
she
is
ready
to
sail
now
and
only
waits
her
clearance
papers
the
captain
was
here
yesterday
morning
she
is
the
golden
dolphin
as
i
have
already
told
you
and
has
often
lain
here
at
our
river
wharves
a
very
good
clean
vessel
with
two
lodgings
for
passengers
i
have
sent
word
that
i
shall
come
on
board
she
waits
in
the
stream
by
badger
s
island
and
you
must
go
from
here
i
have
already
ordered
my
provision
for
the
voyage
rodney
went
down
on
the
gundalow
before
you
were
awake
and
he
will
know
very
well
what
to
do
this
afternoon
i
shall
send
many
other
things
by
boat
i
was
awake
said
mary
softly
but
i
hoped
that
you
were
resting
if
the
seas
are
calm
as
may
happen
i
shall
not
go
to
halifax
confessed
the
other
i
shall
push
on
for
bristol
our
cousin
davis
is
there
and
the
russells
and
many
other
friends
the
brig
is
if
we
should
be
captured
by
which
side
laughed
mary
and
a
sad
gleam
of
answering
humor
flitted
over
madam
wallingford
s
face
oh
we
forget
that
my
poor
child
may
be
dead
already
she
cried
with
sharp
agony
next
moment
i
think
and
think
of
his
hurting
wounds
no
pity
will
be
shown
a
man
whom
they
take
to
be
a
spy
and
she
was
shaken
by
a
most
piteous
outburst
of
tears
then
mary
as
if
the
heart
in
her
own
young
breast
were
made
of
love
alone
tried
to
comfort
madam
wallingford
it
was
neither
the
first
time
nor
the
last
goes
to
the
paths
to
a
true
friend
lie
direct
though
he
be
far
away
the
bright
day
had
clouded
over
and
come
to
a
wet
and
windy
spring
night
it
was
past
eight
o
clock
the
darkness
had
early
fallen
there
was
a
sense
of
comfort
in
a
dry
roof
and
warm
shelter
as
if
it
were
winter
weather
and
master
sullivan
and
old
margery
had
drawn
close
to
their
warm
fireplace
the
master
was
in
a
gay
mood
and
talkative
and
his
wife
was
at
her
usual
business
of
spinning
stepping
to
and
fro
at
a
large
whirring
wheel
to
spin
soft
wool
was
a
better
trade
for
evening
than
the
clacking
insistence
of
the
little
wheel
with
its
more
demanding
flax
margery
was
in
her
best
mood
and
made
a
most
receptive
and
admiring
audience
well
may
god
keep
us
she
exclaimed
at
the
end
of
a
story
t
was
as
big
a
row
as
when
the
galleries
fell
in
smock
alley
theatre
i
often
heard
of
that
from
my
poor
father
master
sullivan
was
pleased
with
his
success
margery
was
not
always
so
easy
to
amuse
but
he
was
in
no
mind
for
a
conflict
something
had
made
his
heart
ache
that
day
and
now
her
love
and
approval
easily
rescued
him
from
his
own
thought
so
he
went
on
as
if
his
fortunes
depended
upon
margery
s
favor
and
frankly
expressed
amusement
one
night
there
was
a
apprentice
boy
to
a
french
upholsterer
this
was
in
london
and
i
a
lad
myself
stolen
over
there
from
paris
with
a
message
for
charles
radcliffe
he
had
great
leanings
toward
the
stage
this
poor
boy
and
for
the
pride
of
his
heart
got
the
chance
to
play
the
ghost
in
hamlet
at
covent
garden
well
it
was
then
indeed
you
might
see
him
at
the
heighth
of
life
and
parading
in
his
pasteboard
armor
mark
me
says
he
with
a
voice
as
if
you
d
thump
the
sides
of
a
cask
ll
mark
you
cries
his
master
from
the
pit
and
he
le
pt
on
the
stage
and
was
after
the
boy
to
kill
him
and
all
the
lads
were
there
le
pt
after
him
to
take
his
part
and
they
held
off
the
master
and
set
the
ghost
in
his
place
again
the
poor
fellow
and
they
said
he
did
his
part
fine
and
creeped
every
skin
that
was
there
he
d
a
great
night
never
mind
the
beating
that
fell
to
him
afterward
the
delighted
listener
shook
with
silent
laughter
t
was
like
the
time
poor
denny
delane
was
in
dublin
i
was
there
but
the
one
winter
myself
continued
the
master
he
came
of
a
fine
family
but
got
and
left
trinity
college
behind
him
like
a
last
year
s
bird
s
nest
every
woman
in
dublin
old
and
young
was
crazy
after
him
there
were
plays
bespoke
and
the
fashion
there
every
night
all
sparked
with
diamonds
and
every
officer
in
his
fine
uniform
there
was
great
dressing
with
the
men
as
you
d
never
see
them
now
my
lord
howth
got
a
fancy
he
d
dress
like
a
coachman
wig
and
all
and
lord
trimlestown
was
always
in
scarlet
when
he
went
abroad
and
my
lord
gormanstown
in
blue
oh
but
they
were
the
pictures
coming
in
their
coaches
you
would
n
t
see
any
officer
out
of
his
uniform
or
a
doctor
wanting
his
lace
ruffles
t
was
my
foolish
young
self
borrowed
all
the
lace
from
my
poor
mother
that
she
d
lend
me
and
i
but
a
boy
and
then
i
d
go
help
myself
out
of
her
boxes
when
she
d
gone
to
mass
she
d
a
great
deal
of
beautiful
lace
and
knew
every
thread
of
it
by
heart
i
ve
a
little
piece
yet
that
was
sewed
under
a
waistcoat
go
get
it
now
and
we
ll
look
at
it
t
is
laid
safe
in
that
second
book
from
the
end
of
the
shelf
you
may
give
it
to
the
little
lady
when
i
m
gone
for
a
remembrance
t
is
the
well
i
ve
nothing
else
in
the
world
but
my
own
poor
self
that
ever
belonged
to
my
dear
mother
the
old
master
s
voice
grew
very
sad
and
all
his
gayety
was
gone
deed
then
miss
mary
hamilton
ll
get
none
of
it
and
you
having
a
daughter
of
your
own
scolded
margery
instantly
grown
as
fierce
as
he
was
sad
sometimes
the
only
way
to
cure
the
master
of
his
dark
sorrows
was
to
make
him
soothe
her
own
anger
but
this
night
he
did
not
laugh
at
her
though
she
quarreled
with
fine
determination
oh
me
groaned
the
master
oh
me
the
fool
i
was
and
he
struck
his
knee
with
a
hopeless
hand
as
he
sat
before
the
fire
god
be
good
to
us
mourned
old
margery
and
i
a
lone
child
sent
to
a
strange
country
without
a
friend
to
look
to
me
and
yourself
taking
notice
of
me
on
the
ship
t
was
the
king
i
thought
you
were
and
you
d
rob
me
now
of
all
that
well
i
was
no
fit
wife
for
a
great
gentleman
i
always
said
it
too
i
loved
you
as
i
don
t
know
how
to
love
my
god
but
i
must
ask
for
nothing
the
evening
s
pleasure
was
broken
the
master
could
bear
anything
better
than
her
poor
whimpering
voice
you
look
at
a
poor
man
as
if
he
were
the
front
of
a
cathedral
he
chided
her
again
trying
to
be
merry
but
at
this
moment
they
were
both
startled
into
silence
they
both
heard
the
heavy
tread
of
horses
before
the
house
come
in
come
in
whoever
you
are
shouted
master
sullivan
as
he
threw
open
the
outer
door
are
ye
lost
on
the
road
that
ye
seek
light
and
lodging
here
the
horses
would
not
stand
the
night
was
dark
as
a
dungeon
the
heavy
rain
blew
in
the
old
man
s
face
his
heart
beat
fast
at
the
sound
of
a
woman
s
voice
by
great
jupiter
and
all
the
gods
what
has
brought
you
here
mary
hamilton
my
dear
child
he
cried
is
there
some
attack
upon
the
coast
t
is
the
hand
of
war
or
death
has
struck
you
the
firelight
shone
upon
mary
s
face
as
she
entered
but
the
wind
and
rain
had
left
no
color
there
it
was
a
wan
face
that
masked
some
high
resolve
and
forbade
either
comment
or
contradiction
she
took
the
chair
to
which
the
master
led
her
and
drew
a
long
breath
as
if
to
assure
herself
of
some
steadiness
of
speech
a
moment
later
her
faithful
friend
john
lord
opened
the
door
softly
and
came
in
also
his
eyes
looked
troubled
but
he
said
nothing
as
he
stood
a
little
way
behind
the
others
in
the
low
room
the
rain
dropped
heavily
from
his
long
coat
to
the
floor
the
sullivans
stood
at
either
side
the
fireplace
watching
the
pale
lady
who
was
their
guest
john
sullivan
himself
it
was
who
unclasped
her
wet
riding
cloak
and
threw
it
back
upon
the
chair
within
she
wore
a
pretty
gown
of
soft
crimson
silk
with
a
golden
thread
in
it
that
had
come
home
in
one
of
her
brother
s
ships
from
holland
the
rain
had
stained
the
breast
of
it
where
the
riding
cloak
had
blown
apart
the
strange
living
dyes
of
the
east
were
brightened
by
the
wet
the
two
old
people
started
back
they
believed
that
she
had
sought
them
because
she
was
hurt
to
death
she
lifted
her
hand
forbiddingly
her
face
grew
like
a
child
s
that
was
striving
against
tears
dear
friends
it
is
not
so
bad
as
you
think
it
is
because
i
am
so
full
of
hope
that
i
have
come
to
you
she
said
to
the
anxious
kind
old
faces
there
was
such
a
sweetness
in
the
girl
s
voice
and
her
beautiful
dress
was
so
familiar
so
belonging
to
the
old
quiet
times
and
happy
hospitalities
that
the
two
men
felt
a
sharp
pain
of
pity
and
because
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
they
came
nearer
to
her
side
master
sullivan
looked
questioningly
at
young
lord
but
old
margery
found
instinctive
relief
in
a
low
droning
sort
of
moan
which
sometimes
lifted
into
that
irish
keening
which
is
the
voice
of
fear
and
sorrow
she
was
piling
all
her
evening
fagots
at
once
upon
the
fire
speak
now
said
the
master
if
my
old
heart
knows
the
worst
it
can
begin
to
hope
the
best
what
is
it
that
could
not
wait
for
the
morning
of
such
a
night
as
this
there
is
bad
news
replied
mary
there
are
letters
come
from
the
ranger
they
have
attacked
a
large
seaport
town
on
the
coast
of
england
and
spread
great
alarm
though
their
chief
projects
were
balked
they
have
fought
with
an
english
frigate
in
the
irish
sea
and
taken
her
captive
with
some
rich
prizes
roger
wallingford
was
left
ashore
in
whitehaven
they
believe
on
the
ship
that
he
tried
to
betray
his
companions
and
warned
the
town
but
he
was
badly
wounded
ashore
and
thrown
into
prison
there
is
a
great
rising
of
the
patriots
against
madam
wallingford
who
is
warned
to
leave
the
country
they
threatened
her
very
life
last
night
mary
was
standing
now
and
the
quick
firelight
sprung
afresh
made
her
look
like
a
bright
flame
the
master
made
a
strange
outcry
like
a
call
for
hidden
help
and
looked
hastily
at
the
walls
of
the
room
about
him
as
if
he
sought
some
old
familiar
weapons
i
am
going
away
with
her
for
a
time
said
mary
speaking
now
without
any
strain
or
quiver
in
her
voice
my
brother
does
not
need
me
since
he
is
with
the
army
and
lord
knows
our
business
here
if
any
be
left
peggy
can
stand
bravely
for
me
in
the
house
dear
master
and
she
came
close
to
the
old
man
s
side
her
young
slender
body
was
almost
as
tall
as
his
she
put
her
arm
about
his
neck
and
drew
down
his
head
so
that
he
must
look
into
her
upturned
face
dear
master
she
said
in
a
low
voice
you
told
me
once
that
you
still
had
friends
in
england
if
the
worst
should
come
to
roger
and
i
think
now
that
the
worst
has
come
you
may
bring
the
horses
at
once
said
the
master
turning
quickly
to
lord
stay
margery
you
must
light
your
old
lantern
and
give
it
him
and
i
would
wrap
you
well
and
hold
it
for
him
to
rub
them
off
with
a
wisp
of
thatch
and
let
them
have
a
mouthful
of
corn
to
satisfy
their
minds
mary
felt
for
that
one
moment
as
if
hope
were
like
an
old
frail
friend
with
eyes
of
living
fire
she
had
known
no
other
father
than
the
master
when
all
was
said
he
put
her
hand
gently
away
from
its
unconscious
clinging
hold
of
his
shoulder
and
with
a
woman
s
care
took
the
wet
cloak
as
he
placed
her
again
in
his
own
chair
and
spread
its
dry
inner
folds
to
the
fire
so
that
they
might
warm
a
little
then
without
speaking
he
went
to
the
shelf
of
books
and
took
from
one
of
them
a
thin
packet
of
papers
i
am
an
old
man
he
said
gently
i
have
been
fearful
of
all
this
and
i
made
ready
these
things
since
it
might
some
day
please
god
to
let
me
die
i
have
heard
of
the
fray
last
night
but
you
will
find
letters
here
that
will
be
of
service
come
warm
you
now
by
the
fire
and
put
them
in
the
bosom
of
your
gown
i
think
you
will
find
them
something
worth
but
if
you
keep
their
words
in
your
heart
or
near
it
t
will
be
far
the
best
and
burn
them
quick
if
there
is
need
but
you
shall
read
them
first
and
send
their
messages
by
word
of
mouth
if
need
be
listen
to
me
now
there
are
a
few
things
left
for
me
to
say
the
girl
s
face
was
full
of
a
sweet
relief
she
did
not
thank
him
save
with
one
long
look
and
put
the
packet
where
he
had
bidden
her
she
looked
into
the
fire
as
she
listened
to
his
counsels
and
suddenly
was
afraid
of
tears
the
errand
being
safely
done
forgive
me
sir
for
this
new
trouble
she
spoke
with
a
different
impulse
and
recognition
from
any
she
had
known
before
and
looked
brave
as
a
young
soldier
this
was
a
friend
who
knew
indeed
the
world
whither
she
was
going
why
should
you
not
come
to
me
asked
the
master
men
were
born
for
the
aid
and
succor
of
men
he
added
with
a
smile
you
do
not
know
your
rabelais
my
little
lady
the
horses
had
come
up
they
trod
the
ground
outside
impatiently
she
knelt
before
the
old
man
humbly
and
he
blessed
her
and
when
she
rose
she
kissed
him
like
a
child
and
looked
long
in
his
face
and
he
in
hers
then
she
put
on
her
heavy
cloak
again
and
went
out
into
the
rainy
night
next
day
in
portsmouth
madam
wallingford
pale
and
stately
and
susan
resolute
enough
but
strangely
apathetic
put
off
into
the
harbor
from
langdon
s
wharf
they
were
accompanied
to
the
shore
by
many
friends
whose
hearts
were
moved
at
so
piteous
a
sight
when
the
mistress
and
maid
were
safe
on
the
deck
of
the
golden
dolphin
mary
hamilton
stood
there
before
them
the
beauty
of
her
young
face
was
like
some
heavenly
creature
s
i
know
that
you
said
last
night
when
i
was
for
bidding
you
farewell
that
you
should
see
me
again
i
have
been
thinking
all
this
morning
that
you
had
been
prevented
whispered
madam
wallingford
tenderly
they
were
long
in
each
other
s
arms
i
have
a
few
things
left
to
say
it
is
impossible
to
remember
all
proper
messages
at
such
short
warning
let
them
keep
the
boat
for
miss
hamilton
until
the
last
moment
before
we
sail
she
said
to
the
captain
they
are
heaving
up
the
anchor
now
the
captain
answered
i
must
not
lose
this
fair
wind
to
get
us
out
of
the
river
mary
was
impatient
to
speak
she
cast
a
smiling
glance
at
susan
who
wore
a
timid
look
not
being
used
to
plots
or
to
taking
instructions
from
any
but
her
mistress
dear
friend
cried
mary
then
you
must
let
me
have
my
way
i
could
not
let
you
go
alone
i
tried
to
think
as
you
bade
me
but
i
could
not
i
am
going
with
you
wherever
you
may
go
i
think
it
is
my
right
you
have
short
time
now
to
give
susan
your
last
charges
as
i
have
given
mine
to
peggy
i
stay
with
you
and
phebe
with
me
and
susan
goes
ashore
please
god
some
short
weeks
or
months
may
see
us
sailing
home
again
up
the
river
with
our
errand
well
done
i
could
not
stand
against
them
madam
and
susan
looked
more
apprehensive
than
triumphant
though
she
was
grateful
to
heaven
to
be
spared
a
voyage
at
sea
her
mistress
was
not
one
to
have
her
own
plans
set
aside
i
listened
well
madam
to
all
you
said
to
rodney
and
the
maids
they
are
good
girls
but
they
need
a
head
over
them
and
i
could
do
nothing
against
miss
mary
for
peggy
that
has
a
love
for
great
ploys
to
be
going
on
and
the
world
turned
upside
down
has
backed
her
from
the
first
mill
lackyng
my
love
i
goe
from
place
to
place
twixt
every
prayer
he
says
he
names
you
once
as
others
drop
a
bead
one
morning
late
in
spring
the
yellow
primroses
were
still
abloom
on
the
high
moorlands
above
plymouth
the
chilly
sea
wind
was
blowing
hard
and
the
bright
sunshine
gave
little
warmth
even
in
a
sheltered
place
the
yard
of
the
great
mill
prison
was
well
defended
by
its
high
stockade
but
the
wind
struck
a
strong
wing
into
it
in
passing
and
set
many
a
poor
man
to
shivering
the
dreary
place
was
crowded
with
sailors
taken
from
american
ships
some
forlorn
faces
were
bleached
by
long
captivity
and
others
were
still
round
and
ruddy
from
recent
seafaring
there
was
a
constant
clack
of
sharp
angry
voices
outside
the
gate
was
a
group
of
idle
sightseers
staring
in
as
if
these
poor
yankees
were
a
menagerie
of
outlandish
beasts
now
and
then
some
compassionate
man
would
toss
a
shilling
between
the
bars
to
be
pitifully
scrambled
for
or
beckon
to
a
prisoner
who
looked
more
suffering
than
the
rest
even
a
gale
hardly
served
to
lighten
the
heavy
air
of
such
a
crowded
place
and
nearly
every
one
looked
distressed
the
had
blighted
many
a
face
so
that
the
whole
company
wore
a
piteous
look
though
each
new
day
still
brought
new
hopes
of
liberty
there
were
small
groups
of
men
sitting
close
together
some
were
playing
at
games
with
pebbles
and
little
sticks
their
draughts
board
or
lines
being
scratched
upon
the
hard
trodden
ground
some
were
writing
letters
and
wondering
how
to
make
sure
of
sending
them
across
the
sea
there
were
only
two
or
three
books
to
be
seen
in
hand
most
of
the
prisoners
were
wearily
doing
nothing
at
all
in
one
corner
a
little
apart
from
the
rest
sat
a
poor
young
captain
who
had
lost
his
first
command
a
small
trading
vessel
on
the
way
to
france
he
looked
very
downcast
and
was
writing
slowly
a
long
and
hopeless
letter
to
his
wife
i
now
regret
that
i
had
not
taken
your
advice
and
mother
s
and
remained
at
home
instead
of
being
a
prisoner
here
he
had
already
written
and
the
stiff
painfully
shaped
words
looked
large
and
small
by
turns
through
his
great
tears
i
was
five
days
in
the
prison
ship
i
am
in
sorrow
our
government
cares
but
little
for
her
subjects
they
have
nothing
allowed
them
but
what
the
british
government
gives
them
shameful
other
nations
feels
for
their
subjects
except
our
country
there
is
no
exchange
of
prisoners
it
is
intirely
uncertain
when
i
return
perhaps
not
during
the
war
i
live
but
very
poor
every
thing
is
high
i
hope
you
have
surmounted
your
difficulties
and
our
child
has
come
a
comfort
to
imploy
your
fond
attention
it
is
hard
the
loss
of
my
ship
and
difficult
to
bare
god
bless
you
all
my
situation
is
not
so
bad
but
it
might
be
worse
this
goes
by
a
cartel
would
to
god
i
could
go
with
it
but
that
happiness
is
denied
me
it
would
pain
your
tender
heart
to
view
the
distressed
seamen
crowded
in
this
filthy
prison
there
is
kind
friends
howiver
in
every
place
and
some
hours
passed
very
pleasant
in
spite
of
every
lack
some
says
the
gallows
or
the
east
indias
will
be
our
dreadful
destiny
t
would
break
a
stone
s
heart
to
see
good
men
go
so
hungry
we
must
go
barefoot
when
our
shoes
is
done
some
eats
the
grass
in
the
yard
and
picks
up
old
bones
and
all
runs
to
snatch
the
stumps
of
our
cabbage
the
cooks
throws
out
some
makes
a
good
soup
they
say
from
snails
a
decent
sort
that
hives
about
the
walls
but
i
have
not
come
to
this
i
could
not
go
it
they
says
we
may
be
scattered
on
the
king
s
ships
i
hear
the
bells
in
plymouth
town
and
dock
pray
god
t
is
for
no
i
hear
in
closing
t
is
only
their
new
lord
mayor
coming
in
as
this
was
finished
there
was
another
man
waiting
close
by
who
caught
impatiently
at
the
ink
and
looked
suspiciously
to
see
if
any
still
remained
harbert
said
s
how
i
should
have
it
next
grumbled
the
fellow
prisoner
if
so
be
you
ve
left
me
any
who
ll
car
our
letters
to
the
cartel
they
want
to
send
a
list
o
those
that
s
dead
out
o
the
dolton
an
i
give
my
promise
to
draw
up
the
names
there
were
many
faces
missing
now
from
the
crew
of
the
dolton
brigantine
taken
nearly
a
year
and
a
half
before
but
there
were
still
a
good
number
of
her
men
left
in
the
prison
others
had
come
from
the
blenheim
or
the
fancy
some
from
the
lexington
and
the
newest
resident
was
a
man
off
the
yankee
hero
who
had
spent
some
time
after
his
capture
as
sailor
on
a
british
he
was
a
friendly
person
and
had
brought
much
welcome
news
being
also
so
strong
and
well
fed
that
he
was
a
pleasant
sight
to
see
just
now
he
sat
with
charles
herbert
of
newbury
in
massachusetts
whom
they
all
called
the
scribe
for
once
this
poor
captive
wore
a
bright
eager
look
on
his
scarred
face
as
he
listened
to
the
newcomer
s
talk
of
affairs
they
had
been
near
neighbors
at
home
the
younger
man
had
been
in
prison
these
many
months
he
was
so
lucky
as
to
possess
a
clumsy
knife
which
was
as
great
a
treasure
as
his
cherished
bottle
of
ink
and
was
busy
making
a
little
box
of
cedar
wood
and
fitting
it
neatly
together
with
pegs
since
he
had
suffered
the
terrible
attack
of
which
had
left
his
face
in
ruins
and
given
him
a
look
of
age
at
twenty
his
eyesight
had
begun
to
fail
he
was
even
now
groping
over
the
ground
to
find
one
of
the
tiny
dowels
that
belonged
to
his
handiwork
t
is
there
by
your
knee
the
rags
of
your
trouser
leg
was
over
it
said
titcomb
the
new
s
man
as
he
reached
for
the
bit
of
wood
who
s
this
new
plant
o
grace
comin
out
o
hospit
l
he
asked
suddenly
looking
over
herbert
s
shoulder
with
the
peg
in
his
fingers
t
is
a
stranger
to
me
and
with
the
air
of
a
gentleman
though
he
lops
about
trying
his
sea
legs
like
an
eel
on
s
tail
no
place
for
gentlemen
here
god
help
him
said
the
young
scribe
sadly
trying
to
clear
his
dull
eyes
with
a
ragged
sleeve
as
he
turned
to
look
no
i
don
t
know
who
it
is
i
did
hear
yisterday
that
there
was
an
officer
fetched
here
in
the
night
from
the
nor
ard
under
guard
and
like
to
be
soon
hanged
some
one
off
of
a
yankee
privateer
they
said
that
went
in
and
burnt
the
shipping
of
a
port
beyond
wales
i
overheared
the
sentinels
havin
some
talk
about
him
last
night
i
expect
t
was
that
old
business
of
the
ranger
and
nothin
new
there
was
a
rough
scuffling
game
going
on
in
the
prison
yard
which
made
all
the
sick
and
disabled
men
shrink
back
against
the
walls
out
of
danger
the
stranger
came
feebly
from
point
to
point
as
the
game
left
space
toward
the
sunny
side
where
the
two
newbury
men
were
sitting
as
they
made
room
for
him
they
saw
that
he
was
dressed
in
the
remains
of
a
torn
uniform
his
arm
was
in
a
sling
and
his
shoulder
fast
bound
with
dirty
bandages
you
re
a
new
bird
in
this
pretty
cage
said
poor
herbert
smiling
pleasantly
he
was
a
fellow
of
sympathetic
heart
and
always
very
friendly
with
the
stranger
returned
his
greeting
with
a
distressed
glance
toward
their
noisy
companions
and
seated
himself
heavily
on
the
ground
leaning
back
against
the
palisade
the
tumult
and
apparent
danger
of
finding
himself
trodden
underfoot
vexed
and
confused
him
in
his
weakness
presently
he
grew
faint
and
his
head
dropped
on
his
breast
his
last
thought
was
a
wish
to
be
back
in
the
wretched
barracks
where
at
least
it
was
quiet
at
that
moment
two
men
pushed
their
way
out
of
the
middle
of
a
quarreling
group
of
playmates
and
ran
toward
him
tain
t
never
you
sir
cried
one
tis
roger
wallingford
too
don
t
you
think
i
ve
got
sense
enough
to
know
scolded
the
other
both
speaking
at
once
in
tones
which
conveyed
much
pity
and
astonishment
to
the
newbury
men
s
ears
by
god
it
is
an

a
dyin
man
gideon
warren
was
a
berwick
sailor
of
the
old
stock
who
had
known
the
lieutenant
from
a
child
and
was
himself
born
and
reared
by
the
river
what
ve
them
devils
used
him
such
a
way
for
he
demanded
angrily
he
looks
as
ancient
as
the
old
judge
his
father
done
the
week
afore
he
died
what
sort
of
a
uniform
s
this
he
s
got
on
him
the
other
men
looked
on
and
any
excitement
being
delightful
in
so
dull
a
place
a
crowd
gathered
about
them
quickly
pushing
and
jostling
and
demanding
to
know
what
had
happened
warren
a
heavily
built
old
mariner
had
fallen
on
his
knees
and
taken
the
sick
man
s
head
on
his
own
ample
shoulder
with
all
the
gentleness
of
a
woman
there
was
more
than

lord
as
he
leaned
forward
to
get
a
better
view
of
the
red
waistcoat
and
above
all
the
gilt
buttons
of
the
new
prisoner

coat

officer

the

to

there

a
passel
o

worked
on
him
and
how
he
ever

here
ain
t
for
me
to
say
but
tis
our
young
squire
wallin
ford
son
an
heir
o
the
best
gentleman
that
was
ever
on
the
old
piscataqua
river
when
we
come
away
folks
was
all
certain
they
had
leanin
s
to
the
wrong
side
his
mother
s
folks
was
high
among
the
boston
tories
explained
ichabod
lord
wonderingly
yet
he
must
ha
been
doin
some
mischief
long
o
the
patriots
or
he
d
never
been
sent
here
for
no
rebel
they
d
never
sent
him
here
this
ain
t
where
they
keep
none
o
their
crown
jew
ls
lord
i
hope
he
ain
t
goin
to
die
afore
he
tells
some
news
from
the
old
lower
landin
an
pound
hill
an
how
things
was
goin
forrard
when
he
left
home
all
up
along
the
witchtrot
road
these
last
words
came
straight
from
the
depths
of
an
exile
s
heart
and
nobody
thought
it
worth
while
to
smile
at
the
names
of
his
localities
there
was
hardly
a
man
who
was
not
longing
for
home
news
in
the
same
desperate
way
a
jail
was
but
a
jail
the
world
over
a
place
to
crowd
a
man
lower
down
soul
and
body
and
england
was
not
likely
to
be
anxious
about
luxuries
for
these
ship
s
companies
of
rebels
and
pirates
the
willful
destroyers
of
her
commerce
they
were
all
thought
guilty
of
treason
and
deserved
the
worst
of
punishment
there
was
a
faint
flicker
of
color
now
on
the
stranger
s
cheeks
and
charles
herbert
had
brought
some
water
and
was
fanning
him
with
a
poor
fragment
of
headgear
while
some
one
else
rubbed
his
cold
hands
they
were
all
well
enough
used
to
seeing
men
in
a
swoon
the
custom
was
to
lay
them
close
to
the
wall
if
they
were
in
the
way
to
recover
themselves
as
best
they
could
but
this
man
with
the
stained
red
waistcoat
might
have
news
to
tell
i
ll
bate
my
head
he
s
been
on
the
ranger
with
paul
jones
announced
ichabod
lord
solemnly
as
if
he
were
ready
to
suffer
for
his
opinions
that
s
what
t
is
they
may
have
all
been
taken
too
off
the
coast
why
tis
the
uniform
of
our
own
congress
navy
then
exclaimed
young
herbert
with
his
scarred
cheeks
gone
bright
crimson
like
a
girl
s
and
a
strange
thrill
in
his
voice
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
the
men
near
him
gave
the
best
cheer
they
could
muster
poor
wallingford
heard
it
and
stirred
a
little
and
half
opened
his
eyes
i
ve
above
two
shillings
here
that
i
ve
airnt
makin
of
my
workboxes
some
o
you
fellows
run
to
the
gates
and
get
a
body
to
fetch
us
some
brandy
begged
herbert
hastily
i
m
all
right
now
said
wallingford
aloud
and
then
he
saw
whose
stout
arms
were
holding
him
and
looked
into
a
familiar
face
good
god
we
had
news
at
home
long
ago
that
you
were
dead
warren
he
said
with
bewilderment
i
bain
t
then
so
now
insisted
the
honest
gideon
indignantly
which
amused
the
audience
so
that
they
fell
to
laughing
and
slapping
one
another
on
the
shoulder
well
i
bain
t
repeated
warren
as
soon
as
he
could
be
heard
i
ve
been
here
in
this
prison
for
seven
months
and
it
s
a
good
deal
worse
n
layin
at
home
in
old
fields
bur
in
ground
right
in
sight
o
the
river
n
all
s
on
tell
us
where
you
come
from
sir
as
soon
s
you
feel
able
and
how
long
you
are
from
barvick
we
get
no
sort
of
news
from
the
folks
i
expect
you
can
t
tell
me
whether
my
old
mother
s
livin
the
poor
man
tried
hard
to
master
his
feelings
but
his
face
began
to
twitch
and
he
burst
out
crying
suddenly
like
a
child
looks
like
they
ve
all
gone
and
forgot
us
said
a
patient
fellow
who
stood
near
wallingford
was
himself
again
now
and
looked
with
dismay
at
those
who
looked
at
him
their
piteous
pallor
and
misery
of
appearance
could
give
but
little
sense
of
welcome
or
comfortable
reassurance
to
a
new
captive
he
was
as
poor
as
they
and
as
lacking
in
present
resource
and
being
weak
and
worn
the
very
kindness
and
pity
of
the
arms
that
held
him
only
added
to
his
pain
if
i
had
not
come
the
last
of
my
way
by
sea
he
told
them
trying
to
speak
some
cheerful
hope
to
such
hopeless
souls
i
might
have
got
word
to
london
or
to
bristol
where
i
can
count
upon
good
friends
but
some
of
the
listeners
looked
incredulous
and
shook
their
heads
doubtfully
while
there
were
those
who
laughed
bitterly
as
they
strolled
away
have
you
any
late
news
from
captain
paul
jones
he
asked
sitting
straight
now
though
warren
still
kept
a
careful
arm
behind
him
i
was
at
whitehaven
with
him
i
belong
on
the
frigate
ranger
and
his
eyes
grew
bright
and
boyish
they
say
that
one
of
her
own
officers
tried
to
betray
the
ship
sneered
a
young
man
a
late
comer
to
the
mill
prison
who
stood
looking
straight
into
poor
wallingford
s
face
t
was
true
enough
too
said
roger
wallingford
frankly
it
is
by
no
fault
of
mine
that
you
see
me
here
god
grant
that
such
treachery
made
no
other
victim
they
say
that
the
ranger
has
taken
a
mort
o
prizes
and
sent
them
back
to
france
announced
the
newbury
sailor
oh
lord
yes
she
s
scared
em
blue
ever
sence
that
night
she
went
into
whitehaven
she
took
the
drake
sloop
o
war
out
o
carrickfergus
that
very
next
day
i
knew
there
was
business
afoot
cried
the
lieutenant
proudly
but
he
suddenly
turned
faint
again
and
they
saw
a
new
bright
stain
strike
through
the
clumsy
bandages
on
his
shoulder
golden
give
where
want
is
silently
clamorous
and
men
s
necessities
not
their
tongues
do
loudly
call
for
thy
mercies
the
less
said
of
a
dull
sea
voyage
the
better
to
madam
wallingford
and
her
young
companion
their
slow
crossing
to
the
port
of
bristol
could
be
but
a
long
delay
each
day
of
the
first
week
seemed
like
a
week
in
passing
though
from
very
emptiness
it
might
be
but
a
moment
in
remembrance
time
in
itself
being
like
money
in
itself
at
all
unless
changed
into
action
sensation
material
at
first
for
these
passengers
by
the
golden
dolphin
there
was
no
hope
of
amusement
of
any
sort
to
shorten
the
eventless
hours
their
hearts
were
too
heavy
with
comfortless
anxieties
the
sea
was
calm
and
the
may
winds
light
but
steady
from
the
west
it
was
very
warm
for
the
season
of
year
and
the
discouragements
of
early
morning
in
the
close
cabin
were
easily
blown
away
by
the
fresh
air
of
the
the
captain
a
man
but
diffident
in
the
company
of
ladies
left
his
vessel
s
owner
and
her
young
companion
very
much
to
themselves
mary
had
kept
to
a
sweet
composure
and
uncomplainingness
for
her
old
friend
s
sake
but
she
knew
many
difficult
hours
of
regret
and
uncertainty
now
that
having
once
taken
this
great
step
madam
wallingford
appeared
to
look
to
her
entirely
for
support
and
counsel
and
almost
to
forget
upon
how
great
an
adventure
they
had
set
forth
all
mary
s
own
cares
and
all
her
own
obligations
and
beliefs
sometimes
rose
before
her
mind
as
if
in
jealous
arraignment
of
her
presence
on
the
ship
yet
though
she
might
think
of
her
brother
s
displeasure
and
anxiety
and
in
the
darkest
moments
of
all
might
call
herself
a
deserter
and
count
the
slow
hours
of
a
restless
night
when
morning
came
one
look
at
madam
wallingford
s
pale
face
in
the
gray
light
of
their
cabin
was
enough
to
reassure
the
bravery
of
her
heart
in
still
worse
hours
of
that
poor
lady
s
angry
accusation
of
those
whom
she
believed
to
be
their
country
s
enemies
mary
yet
found
it
possible
to
be
patient
as
we
always
may
be
when
pity
comes
to
help
us
there
was
ever
a
final
certainty
in
her
breast
that
she
had
not
done
wrong
she
was
only
yielding
to
an
inevitable
irresistible
force
of
love
love
itself
had
brought
her
out
of
her
own
country
often
they
sat
pleasantly
together
upon
the
deck
the
weather
was
so
clear
and
fine
mary
being
always
at
madam
wallingford
s
feet
on
a
stout
little
oaken
footstool
busy
with
her
needle
to
fashion
a
warmer
or
to
work
at
a
piece
of
slow
embroidery
on
a
strip
of
linen
that
peggy
had
long
ago
woven
on
their
own
loom
often
the
hearts
of
both
these
women
who
were
mistresses
of
great
houses
and
the
caretakers
of
many
dependents
were
full
of
anxious
thought
of
home
and
all
its
business
halfway
from
land
to
land
with
the
far
horizon
of
a
calm
sea
unbroken
by
mast
or
sail
the
sky
was
so
empty
by
day
that
the
stars
at
night
brought
welcome
evidence
of
life
and
even
companionship
as
if
the
great
processes
of
the
universe
were
akin
to
the
conscious
life
on
their
own
little
ship
in
spite
of
the
cruelty
of
a
doubt
that
would
sometimes
attack
her
mary
never
quite
lost
hold
on
a
higher
courage
or
the
belief
that
they
were
on
their
way
to
serve
one
whom
they
both
loved
to
do
something
which
they
alone
could
do
the
thought
struck
her
afresh
one
afternoon
that
they
might
easily
enough
run
into
danger
as
they
came
near
land
they
might
not
only
fall
an
easy
prey
to
some
yankee
privateer
for
their
sailing
papers
were
now
from
halifax
but
they
might
meet
the
ranger
herself
as
they
came
upon
the
english
coast
a
quick
flush
brightened
the
girl
s
cheeks
but
a
smile
of
confidence
and
amusement
followed
it
madam
wallingford
was
watching
her
from
the
long
chair
you
seem
very
cheerful
my
dear
child
she
said
wistfully
i
was
heartened
by
a
funny
little
dream
in
broad
daylight
answered
mary
frankly
looking
up
with
something
like
love
itself
unveiled
in
her
clear
eyes
it
is
like
to
be
anything
but
gay
in
bristol
when
we
come
to
land
answered
madam
wallingford
i
had
news
in
halifax
when
we
lay
there
that
many
of
their
best
merchants
in
bristol
are
broken
and
are
for
a
petition
to
parliament
to
end
these
troubles
quickly
all
their
once
great
trade
with
the
colonies
is
done
i
spent
many
happy
months
in
bristol
when
i
was
young
t
was
a
noble
town
with
both
riches
and
learning
and
full
of
sights
too
it
was
a
fit
town
for
gentlefolk
i
sometimes
think
that
if
anything
could
give
back
my
old
strength
again
t
would
be
to
take
the
air
upon
the
clifton
downs
you
will
have
many
things
to
show
me
said
mary
with
a
smile
you
are
better
already
for
the
sea
air
madam
it
does
my
heart
good
to
see
the
change
in
you
oh
dear
child
if
we
were
only
there
cried
the
poor
lady
life
is
too
hard
for
me
it
seems
sometimes
as
if
i
can
not
bear
it
a
moment
longer
yet
i
shall
find
strength
for
what
i
have
to
do
i
wonder
if
we
must
take
long
journeys
at
once
t
is
not
so
far
if
roger
should
be
at
plymouth
as
they
believed
among
the
halifax
friends
but
i
saw
one
stranger
shake
his
head
and
look
at
me
with
pity
as
i
put
my
questions
he
was
from
england
too
and
just
off
the
sea
there
is
one
thing
i
am
certain
of
is
not
dead
said
mary
we
are
sure
to
find
him
soon
she
added
in
a
different
tone
when
she
had
spoken
out
of
her
heart
for
very
certainty
the
mother
s
face
took
on
a
sweet
look
of
relief
mary
was
so
so
sure
of
what
she
said
that
it
could
not
help
being
a
comfort
our
cousin
davis
will
be
gathering
age
madam
wallingford
continued
after
a
little
while
i
look
to
find
her
most
sadly
changed
she
had
been
married
two
years
already
when
i
made
my
first
voyage
to
england
and
went
to
visit
her
mary
looked
up
eagerly
from
her
work
as
if
to
beg
some
further
reminiscences
of
the
past
because
she
loved
madam
wallingford
so
well
it
was
pleasant
to
share
the
past
with
her
the
old
distance
between
them
grew
narrower
day
by
day
i
was
but
a
girl
of
seventeen
when
i
first
saw
bristol
and
i
went
straight
to
her
house
from
the
ship
as
i
hope
we
may
do
now
if
that
dear
heart
still
remains
in
a
world
that
needs
her
said
the
elder
woman
she
is
of
kin
to
your
own
people
you
must
remember
as
well
as
to
the
wallingfords
yes
she
was
glad
of
my
visit
too
for
she
was
still
mourning
for
her
mother
being
the
youngest
child
she
had
been
close
with
her
till
her
marriage
and
always
a
favorite
they
had
never
been
parted
for
a
night
or
slept
but
under
the
same
roof
until
young
davis
would
marry
her
and
could
not
be
gainsaid
he
had
come
to
the
piscataqua
plantations
supercargo
of
a
great
ship
of
his
father
s
the
whole
countryside
had
flocked
to
see
so
fine
a
vessel
when
she
lay
in
the
stream
at
portsmouth
she
was
called
the
rose
and
crown
she
was
painted
and
gilded
in
her
cabin
like
a
king
s
pleasure
ship
he
promised
that
his
wife
should
come
home
every
second
year
for
a
long
visit
and
bragged
of
their
ships
being
always
on
the
ocean
he
said
she
should
keep
her
carriage
both
on
sea
and
on
land
t
was
but
the
promise
of
a
courting
man
he
was
older
than
she
and
already
very
masterful
he
had
grown
stern
and
sober
and
made
grave
laws
for
his
household
when
i
saw
it
two
years
later
he
had
come
to
be
his
father
s
sole
heir
and
felt
the
weight
of
great
affairs
and
said
he
could
not
spare
his
wife
out
of
his
sight
when
she
pleaded
to
return
with
me
a
woman
s
place
was
in
her
husband
s
house
mother
and
child
had
the
sundering
sea
ever
between
them
and
never
looked
in
each
other
s
face
again
for
mistress
goodwin
was
too
feeble
to
take
the
journey
though
she
was
younger
than
i
am
now
he
was
an
honest
man
and
skillful
merchant
was
john
davis
but
few
men
can
read
a
woman
s
heart
which
lives
by
longing
and
not
by
reason
t
is
writ
in
another
language
you
have
often
heard
of
the
mother
old
mistress
goodwin
who
was
taken
to
canada
by
the
savages
and
who
saw
her
child
killed
by
them
before
her
eyes
they
threatened
to
kill
her
too
because
she
wept
and
an
indian
woman
pitied
her
and
flung
water
in
her
face
to
hide
the
tears
the
speaker
ended
much
moved
oh
yes
i
always
wish
i
could
remember
her
answered
mary
she
was
a
woman
of
great
valor
and
with
such
a
history
t
was
like
living
two
lifetimes
in
one
the
girl
s
face
shone
with
eagerness
as
she
looked
up
and
again
bent
over
her
needlework
she
was
the
mother
of
all
the
goodwins
they
have
cause
enough
for
pride
when
they
think
of
her
she
had
great
beauty
too
even
in
her
latest
age
though
her
face
was
marked
by
sorrow
continued
madam
wallingford
easily
led
toward
entertaining
herself
by
the
listener
s
interest
the
hope
of
pleasing
mary
mistress
godwin
was
the
skillful
hostess
of
any
company
small
or
great
and
full
of
life
even
when
she
was
bent
double
by
her
weight
of
years
and
had
seen
most
of
her
children
die
before
her
there
was
a
look
in
her
eyes
as
of
one
who
could
see
spirits
and
yet
she
was
called
a
very
cheerful
person
t
was
indeed
a
double
life
as
if
she
knew
the
next
world
long
before
she
left
this
one
they
said
she
was
long
remembered
by
the
folk
she
lived
among
in
canada
she
would
have
done
much
kindness
there
even
in
her
distress
her
husband
was
a
plain
kind
man
very
able
and
like
most
goodwins
but
she
was
born
a
plaisted
of
the
great
house
they
were
the
best
family
then
in
the
plantation
oh
yes
i
can
see
her
now
as
if
she
stood
before
me
small
body
but
lit
with
flame
from
no
common
altar
of
the
gods
exclaimed
madam
wallingford
after
a
moment
s
pause
she
had
the
fine
dignity
which
so
many
women
lack
in
these
days
and
knew
no
fear
they
always
said
except
at
the
sight
of
some
savage
face
this
i
have
often
heard
old
people
say
of
her
earlier
years
when
the
indians
were
still
in
the
country
she
would
be
startled
by
them
as
if
she
came
suddenly
upon
a
serpent
yet
she
would
treat
them
kindly
i
remember
when
some
of
our
old
men
still
brought
their
guns
to
church
and
stood
them
in
the
pews
said
mary
but
this
year
there
were
only
two
poor
huts
in
the
vineyard
when
the
indians
came
down
the
country
to
catch
the
salmon
and
dry
them
there
are
but
a
feeble
few
of
all
their
great
tribe
t
is
strange
to
know
that
a
whole
nation
has
lived
on
our
lands
before
us
i
wonder
if
we
shall
disappear
in
our
own
turn
peggy
always
says
that
when
the
first
settlers
came
up
the
river
they
found
traces
of
ancient
settlement
the
vineyard
was
there
with
its
planted
vines
all
run
to
waste
and
of
a
great
age
and
the
old
fields
too
which
have
given
our
river
neighborhoods
their
name
peggy
says
there
were
other
white
people
in
barvick
long
ago
the
old
indians
had
some
strange
legends
of
a
folk
who
had
gone
away
did
mistress
goodwin
ever
speak
of
her
captivity
or
the
terrible
march
to
canada
through
the
snow
when
she
was
captured
with
the
other
barvick
folk
madam
asked
mary
with
eagerness
to
return
to
their
first
subject
people
do
not
speak
much
of
those
old
times
now
since
our
own
troubles
came
on
no
no
she
would
never
talk
of
her
trials
t
was
not
her
way
protested
madam
wallingford
and
a
shadow
crossed
her
face
t
was
her
only
happiness
to
forget
such
things
i
can
see
her
sitting
in
the
sun
with
a
fescue
in
her
hand
teaching
the
little
children
they
needed
bravery
in
those
old
days
nothing
can
haunt
us
as
their
fear
of
sudden
assault
and
savage
cruelty
must
have
haunted
them
mary
thought
quickly
enough
of
that
angry
mob
which
had
so
lately
gathered
about
her
old
friend
s
door
but
she
said
nothing
the
sons
of
liberty
and
their
visit
seemed
to
have
left
no
permanent
discomfort
in
madam
s
mind
no
no
said
the
girl
aloud
we
have
grown
so
comfortable
that
even
war
has
its
luxuries
they
have
said
that
a
common
soldier
grows
dainty
with
his
food
and
lodging
and
the
commanders
are
daily
fretted
by
such
complaints
there
is
not
much
comfort
to
be
had
poor
fellows
exclaimed
madam
wallingford
rebukingly
as
if
she
and
mary
had
changed
sides
not
at
your
valley
forge
and
not
with
the
king
s
troops
last
year
in
boston
they
suffered
everything
but
not
more
than
the
rebels
liked
mary
s
cheeks
grew
red
at
the
offensive
word
do
not
say
rebels
she
entreated
i
do
not
think
that
mistress
hetty
goodwin
would
side
with
parliament
if
she
were
living
still
think
how
they
loved
our
young
country
and
what
they
bore
for
it
in
those
early
days
t
is
not
to
the
purpose
child
answered
the
old
lady
sharply
they
were
all
for
england
against
france
and
her
cruel
indian
allies
i
meant
by
rebels
but
a
party
word
hetty
goodwin
might
well
be
of
my
mind
too
old
to
learn
irreverence
toward
the
king
i
hate
some
of
his
surrounders
can
own
to
that
i
hate
the
bedfords
and
i
have
but
scorn
for
his
lord
sandwich
or
for
rockingham
they
are
treating
our
american
loyalists
without
justice
sir
william
howe
might
have
had
five
thousand
men
of
us
had
he
made
proclamation
fifty
of
the
best
gentlemen
in
philadelphia
who
were
for
the
crown
waited
upon
him
only
to
be
rebuffed
she
checked
herself
quickly
and
glanced
at
mary
as
if
she
were
sorry
to
have
acknowledged
so
much
yes
i
count
upon
fox
to
stand
our
friend
rather
than
upon
these
and
we
have
franklin
too
who
is
enough
to
think
of
the
colonies
themselves
and
to
forget
their
petty
factious
and
rivalries
let
us
agree
let
us
agree
if
we
can
and
madam
wallingford
whose
dignity
was
not
a
thing
to
be
lightly
touched
turned
toward
mary
with
a
winning
smile
she
knew
that
she
must
trust
herself
more
and
more
to
this
young
heart
s
patience
and
kindness
yes
and
to
her
judgment
about
their
plans
thank
god
this
child
who
loved
her
was
always
at
her
side
with
a
strange
impulse
to
confess
all
these
things
she
put
out
her
frail
hand
to
mary
and
mary
willingly
drawing
a
little
closer
held
it
to
her
cheek
they
could
best
understand
each
other
without
words
the
girl
had
a
clear
mind
and
had
listened
much
to
the
talk
of
men
the
womanish
arguments
of
madam
wallingford
always
strangely
confused
her
franklin
will
ever
be
as
young
at
heart
as
he
is
old
in
years
said
the
lady
presently
with
the
old
charm
of
her
manner
and
all
wistfulness
and
worry
quite
gone
from
her
face
she
had
been
strengthened
by
mary
s
love
in
the
failing
citadel
of
her
heart
tis
franklin
s
most
noble
gift
that
he
can
keep
in
sympathy
with
the
thoughts
and
purposes
of
younger
men
age
is
wont
to
be
narrow
and
to
depend
upon
certainties
of
the
past
while
youth
has
its
easily
gathered
hopes
and
quick
intuitions
franklin
is
both
characters
at
once
sanguine
as
he
is
experienced
i
knew
him
well
he
will
be
the
same
man
now
and
as
easy
a
courtier
as
he
was
then
content
with
his
thrift
and
prudence
i
trust
him
among
the
first
of
those
who
can
mend
our
present
troubles
i
beg
you
not
to
think
that
i
am
unmindful
of
our
wrongs
in
the
colonies
mary
my
dear
she
added
then
in
a
changed
voice
t
is
but
your
foolish
way
of
trying
to
mend
them
that
has
grieved
me
who
call
yourselves
the
patriots
mary
smiled
again
and
kept
silence
but
with
something
of
a
doubtful
heart
she
did
not
wish
to
argue
about
politics
that
sunny
day
on
the
sea
no
good
could
come
of
it
though
she
had
a
keen
sense
that
her
companion
s
mind
was
now
sometimes
unsettled
from
its
old
prejudices
and
firm
beliefs
the
captain
was
a
stanch
royalist
who
believed
that
the
rebels
were
sure
to
be
put
down
and
that
no
sensible
man
should
find
himself
left
in
the
foolish
situation
of
a
king
s
antagonist
or
suffer
the
futility
of
such
defeat
will
mistress
davis
look
like
her
mother
do
you
think
mary
again
bethought
herself
to
return
to
the
simpler
subject
of
their
conversation
yes
no
doubt
they
had
the
same
brave
eyes
and
yet
strangely
timid
look
t
is
a
delicate
frail
spirited
face
our
cousin
davis
would
be
now
she
was
already
gray
in
her
twenties
when
i
last
saw
her
it
sometimes
seems
but
the
other
day
they
said
that
mistress
goodwin
came
home
from
canada
with
her
hair
as
white
as
snow
yes
their
eyes
were
alike
but
the
daughter
had
a
goodwin
look
small
featured
and
neatly
made
as
their
women
are
she
could
hold
to
a
purpose
and
was
very
capable
and
had
wonderful
quickness
with
figures
t
is
common
to
the
whole
line
mistress
hetty
the
mother
had
a
pleasing
gentleness
but
great
dignity
she
was
born
of
those
who
long
had
been
used
to
responsibility
and
the
direction
of
others
mary
laughed
a
little
when
you
say
capable
it
makes
me
think
of
old
peggy
at
home
she
explained
one
day
not
long
ago
i
was
in
the
spinning
room
while
we
chose
a
pattern
for
the
new
table
linen
and
she
had
a
child
there
with
her
you
know
that
peggy
is
fond
of
a
little
guest
there
had
been
talk
of
a
cake
and
the
child
was
currying
favor
lest
she
should
be
forgotten
mrs
peggy
she
piped
my
aunt
betsey
says
as
how
you
re
a
very
capering
woman
what
what
says
peggy
your
aunt
betsey
indeed
you
mite
oh
i
expect
t
was
capable
she
meant
peggy
declared
next
moment
a
little
pacified
and
turned
to
me
with
a
lofty
air
can
t
folks
have
an
english
tongue
in
their
heads
she
grumbled
but
she
ended
our
high
affairs
then
and
went
off
to
the
kitchen
with
the
child
safe
in
hand
i
can
see
her
go
and
madam
wallingford
laughed
too
easily
pleased
with
the
homely
tale
ah
but
we
must
not
laugh
it
hurts
my
poor
heart
even
to
smile
she
whispered
my
dear
son
is
in
prison
we
know
not
where
and
i
have
been
forgetting
him
when
i
can
laugh
i
know
not
if
he
be
live
or
dead
and
we
are
so
far
from
him
tossing
in
the
midseas
oh
what
can
two
women
like
us
do
in
england
in
this
time
of
bitterness
if
the
loyalists
are
reckoned
but
brothers
of
the
rebels
i
dreamed
it
was
all
different
till
we
heard
such
tales
in
halifax
we
shall
find
many
friends
and
we
need
never
throw
away
our
hope
said
mary
hamilton
soothingly
and
master
sullivan
bade
me
remember
with
his
last
blessing
that
god
never
makes
us
feel
our
weakness
except
to
lead
us
to
seek
strength
from
him
t
was
the
saying
of
his
old
priest
the
abbé
fénelon
they
sat
silent
together
the
motion
of
the
ship
was
gentle
enough
and
the
western
breeze
was
steady
it
seemed
like
a
quiet
night
again
the
sun
was
going
down
and
there
was
a
golden
light
in
the
thick
web
of
rigging
overhead
and
the
gray
sails
were
turned
to
gold
color
it
is
i
who
should
be
staying
you
dear
child
whispered
madam
wallingford
putting
out
her
hand
again
and
resting
it
on
mary
s
shoulder
but
you
never
fail
to
comfort
me
i
have
bitterly
reproached
myself
many
and
many
a
day
for
letting
you
follow
me
t
is
like
the
book
of
ruth
which
always
brought
my
tears
as
i
read
it
i
am
far
happier
here
with
you
than
i
have
been
many
a
day
at
home
in
my
lonely
house
i
need
wish
for
a
daughter
s
love
no
more
i
sometimes
forget
even
my
great
sorrow
and
my
fear
of
our
uncertainty
and
dread
the
day
when
we
shall
come
to
land
i
wish
i
were
not
so
full
of
fears
yet
i
do
not
think
god
will
let
me
die
till
i
have
seen
my
son
mary
could
not
look
just
then
at
her
old
friend
s
fragile
figure
and
anxious
face
she
had
indeed
taken
a
great
charge
upon
herself
and
a
weakness
stole
over
her
own
heart
that
could
hardly
be
borne
what
difficulties
and
disappointments
were
before
them
god
only
knew
dear
child
said
madam
wallingford
whose
eyes
were
fixed
upon
mary
s
unconscious
face
is
it
your
dreams
that
keep
your
heart
so
light
i
wish
that
you
could
share
them
with
the
like
me
all
this
long
winter
you
have
shown
a
heavenly
patience
but
your
face
was
often
sad
and
this
has
grieved
me
i
have
thought
since
we
came
to
sea
that
you
have
been
happier
than
you
were
before
t
was
not
the
distresses
that
we
all
knew
something
pained
me
that
i
could
not
understand
now
it
troubles
me
no
more
and
mary
looked
at
the
questioner
with
a
frank
smile
i
am
above
all
a
hater
of
curious
questions
insisted
the
lady
but
mary
did
not
turn
her
eyes
away
and
smiled
again
i
can
hold
myself
to
silence
said
madam
wallingford
i
should
not
have
spoken
but
for
the
love
and
true
interest
of
my
heart
twas
not
a
vulgar
greed
of
curiosity
that
moved
me
i
am
thankful
enough
for
your
good
cheer
you
have
left
home
and
many
loving
cares
and
have
come
with
me
upon
this
forced
and
anxious
journey
as
if
it
were
but
a
holiday
mary
bent
lower
over
her
sewing
now
that
we
have
no
one
but
each
other
i
should
be
glad
to
put
away
one
thought
that
has
distressed
me
much
confessed
the
mother
and
her
voice
trembled
you
have
never
said
that
you
had
any
word
from
roger
surely
there
is
no
misunderstanding
between
you
i
have
sometimes
oh
remember
that
i
am
his
mother
mary
he
has
not
written
even
to
me
in
his
old
open
fashion
there
has
been
a
difference
as
if
the
great
distance
had
for
once
come
between
our
hearts
but
this
last
letter
was
from
his
own
true
heart
from
his
very
self
the
knowledge
that
he
was
not
happy
made
me
fearful
and
yet
i
can
not
brook
the
thought
that
he
has
been
faithless
galling
though
his
hasty
oath
may
have
been
to
him
oh
no
no
i
hate
myself
for
speaking
so
dark
a
thought
as
this
my
son
is
a
man
of
high
honor
she
spoke
proudly
yet
her
anxious
face
was
drawn
with
pain
mary
laid
down
her
piece
of
linen
and
clasped
her
hands
together
strongly
in
her
lap
there
was
something
deeply
serious
in
her
expression
as
she
gazed
off
upon
the
sea
it
is
all
right
now
she
said
presently
speaking
very
simply
and
not
without
effort
i
have
been
grieved
for
many
weeks
ever
since
the
first
letters
came
i
had
no
word
at
all
from
roger
and
we
had
been
such
friends
the
captain
wrote
twice
to
me
as
i
told
you
his
letters
were
the
letters
of
a
gentleman
and
most
kind
i
could
be
sure
that
there
was
no
trouble
between
them
as
i
feared
sometimes
at
first
and
the
bright
color
rushed
to
her
face
it
put
me
to
great
anxiety
but
the
very
morning
before
we
sailed
a
letter
came
from
roger
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
speak
of
it
then
i
can
hardly
tell
you
now
and
it
is
all
clear
between
you
i
see
was
some
misunderstanding
my
dear
remember
that
my
boy
is
sometimes
very
quick
t
is
a
hasty
temper
but
a
warm
and
true
heart
is
it
all
clear
now
mary
wished
to
answer
but
she
could
not
for
all
her
trying
manage
to
speak
a
word
she
did
not
wish
to
show
the
deep
feeling
that
was
moving
her
and
first
looked
seaward
again
and
then
took
up
her
needlework
her
hand
touched
the
bosom
of
her
gown
to
feel
if
the
letter
were
there
and
safe
madam
wallingford
smiled
and
was
happy
enough
in
such
a
plain
assurance
oh
yes
mary
found
herself
saying
next
moment
quite
unconsciously
the
wave
of
happy
emotion
having
left
her
calm
again
oh
yes
i
have
come
to
understand
everything
now
dear
madam
and
the
letter
was
written
while
the
ranger
lay
in
the
port
of
brest
they
were
sailing
any
day
for
the
english
coast
sometimes
i
fear
that
he
may
be
dead
this
very
sense
of
his
living
nearness
to
my
heart
may
be
the
dread
of
losing
him
wakes
me
from
my
sleep
but
sometimes
by
day
i
can
feel
him
thinking
to
me
just
as
i
always
have
since
he
was
a
child
t
is
just
as
if
he
spoke
and
the
tears
stood
bright
in
madam
wallingford
s
eyes
no
dear
he
is
not
dead
said
mary
listening
eagerly
but
she
could
not
tell
even
roger
wallingford
s
mother
the
reason
why
she
was
so
certain
come
to
the
wise
will
remember
through
sevenfold
births
the
love
of
those
who
wiped
away
their
falling
tears
miss
mary
hamilton
and
the
captain
of
the
golden
dolphin
walked
together
from
the
busy
boat
landing
up
into
the
town
of
bristol
the
tide
was
far
down
and
the
captain
being
a
stout
man
was
still
wheezing
from
his
steep
climb
on
the
long
it
was
good
to
feel
the
comfort
of
solid
ground
underfoot
and
to
hear
so
loud
and
cheerful
a
noise
of
english
voices
after
their
four
long
weeks
at
sea
and
the
ring
and
clank
of
coppersmiths
hammers
were
not
unpleasant
to
the
ear
even
in
a
narrow
street
the
captain
was
in
a
jovial
temper
of
mind
he
had
some
considerable
interest
in
his
cargo
and
they
had
been
in
constant
danger
off
the
coast
now
that
he
was
safe
ashore
and
the
brig
was
safe
at
anchor
he
stepped
quickly
and
carried
his
head
high
and
asked
their
shortest
way
to
davis
s
house
to
leave
mary
there
while
he
made
plans
for
coming
up
to
one
of
that
merchant
s
wharves
here
we
are
at
last
exclaimed
the
master
mariner
i
can
find
my
way
across
the
sea
straight
to
king
s
road
and
bristol
quay
but
i
m
easy
lost
in
the
crooked
ways
of
a
town
i
ve
seen
the
port
of
bristol
too
a
score
o
times
since
i
was
first
a
sailor
but
i
saw
it
never
so
dull
as
now
there
it
is
the
large
house
beyond
to
the
side
he
lives
like
a
nobleman
does
old
sir
davis
i
ll
leave
ye
here
now
and
go
my
ways
they
ve
sarvents
a
plenty
to
see
ye
back
to
the
strand
the
shy
and
much
occupied
captain
now
made
haste
toward
the
merchant
s
and
mary
hurried
on
toward
the
house
anxious
to
know
if
madam
wallingford
s
hopes
were
to
be
assured
and
if
they
should
find
mistress
davis
not
only
alive
and
well
but
ready
to
welcome
them
as
she
came
nearer
her
heart
beat
fast
at
the
sight
of
a
lady
s
trim
head
and
not
without
distinction
of
look
behind
the
panes
of
a
bowed
window
it
was
as
plain
that
this
was
a
familiar
sight
that
it
might
every
day
be
seen
framed
in
its
place
within
the
little
panes
as
if
mary
had
known
the
face
since
childhood
and
watched
for
a
daily
greeting
as
she
walked
a
portsmouth
street
at
home
she
even
hesitated
for
a
moment
looking
eagerly
ere
she
went
to
lift
the
bright
knocker
of
the
street
door
in
a
minute
more
she
was
in
the
room
i
am
mary
hamilton
of
berwick
said
the
guest
with
pretty
eagerness
and
i
bring
you
love
and
greeting
from
madam
wallingford
your
old
friend
from
madam
wallingford
exclaimed
the
hostess
who
had
thought
to
see
a
neighbor
s
daughter
enter
from
the
street
and
now
beheld
a
stranger
a
beautiful
young
creature
with
a
beseeching
look
in
her
half
familiar
face
come
you
indeed
from
old
barvick
my
dear
you
are
just
off
the
sea
by
your
fresh
looks
i
was
thinking
of
cousin
wallingford
within
this
very
hour
i
grieved
to
think
that
now
we
are
both
so
old
i
can
never
see
her
face
again
so
you
bring
me
news
of
her
sit
you
down
i
can
say
that
you
are
most
welcome
her
eyes
were
like
a
younger
woman
s
and
they
never
left
mary
s
face
she
is
here
she
is
in
the
harbor
on
board
the
golden
dolphin
one
of
her
own
ships
i
have
not
only
brought
news
to
you
i
have
brought
her
very
self
said
the
girl
joyfully
there
was
a
quick
shadow
upon
the
hostess
s
face
alas
then
poor
soul
i
fear
she
has
been
driven
from
her
home
by
trouble
she
would
be
one
of
the
loyalists
i
ll
send
for
her
at
once
come
nearer
me
sit
here
in
the
window
seat
begged
mistress
davis
affectionately
you
are
little
mary
hamilton
of
the
fine
house
i
have
heard
of
and
never
seen
the
pride
of
my
dear
old
barvick
but
your
brother
would
not
change
sides
you
are
both
of
the
new
party
have
heard
all
that
months
ago
how
happens
it
that
the
golden
dolphin
brought
you
hither
too
mary
seated
herself
in
the
deep
window
while
mistress
davis
gazed
at
her
wonderingly
she
had
a
tender
heart
she
could
read
the
signs
of
great
effort
and
of
loneliness
in
the
bright
girlish
face
she
did
not
speak
but
her
long
discerning
look
and
the
touch
of
her
hand
gave
such
motherly
comfort
that
the
girl
might
easily
have
fallen
to
weeping
it
was
not
that
mary
thought
of
any
mean
pity
for
herself
or
even
remembered
that
her
dear
charge
had
sometimes
shown
the
unconscious
selfishness
of
weakness
and
grief
but
brave
and
hearts
always
know
the
true
value
of
sympathy
they
were
friends
and
lovers
at
first
sight
the
young
girl
and
the
elderly
woman
who
was
also
i
have
had
your
house
filled
to
its
least
garrets
with
royalists
out
of
my
own
country
and
here
comes
still
another
of
them
with
a
young
friend
who
is
of
the
other
party
mistress
davis
said
gayly
and
the
guest
looked
up
to
see
a
handsome
old
man
who
had
entered
from
another
room
and
who
frowned
doubtfully
as
he
received
this
information
mary
s
head
was
dark
against
the
window
and
he
took
small
notice
of
her
at
first
though
some
young
men
outside
in
the
street
had
observed
so
much
of
her
beauty
as
was
visible
and
were
walking
to
and
fro
on
the
pavement
hoping
for
a
still
brighter
vision
this
is
miss
mary
hamilton
of
barvick
announced
the
mistress
and
your
old
friend
madam
wallingford
is
in
harbor
on
one
of
her
ships
she
knew
that
she
need
say
no
more
john
davis
alderman
of
bristol
and
senior
warden
of
his
parish
church
now
came
forward
with
some
gallantry
of
manner
i
do
not
like
to
lay
a
new
charge
upon
you
said
his
wife
pleading
prettily
but
these
are
not
as
our
other
fugitives
poor
souls
and
she
smiled
as
if
with
some
confidence
why
no
these
be
both
of
them
your
own
kinsfolk
if
i
mistake
not
the
merchant
agreed
handsomely
and
the
better
part
of
our
living
has
come
in
times
past
from
my
dealings
with
the
husband
of
one
and
the
good
brother
of
the
other
i
should
think
it
a
pity
if
for
whatever
reason
they
may
have
crossed
the
sea
we
did
not
open
wide
our
door
you
must
bid
your
maids
make
ready
for
their
comfortable
housing
i
shall
go
at
once
to
find
the
captain
since
he
has
come
safe
to
land
in
these
days
of
piracy
and
give
so
noble
a
gentlewoman
as
his
owner
my
best
welcome
and
service
on
the
ship
perhaps
miss
hamilton
will
walk
with
me
and
give
her
own
orders
about
her
affairs
mary
stepped
forward
willingly
from
the
window
in
answer
to
so
kind
a
greeting
and
when
she
was
within
close
range
of
the
old
man
s
eyes
she
was
inspected
with
such
rapid
approval
and
happy
surprise
that
alderman
davis
bent
his
stately
head
and
saluted
so
fair
a
brow
without
further
consideration
she
was
for
following
him
at
once
on
his
kind
errand
but
she
first
ran
back
and
kissed
the
dear
mistress
of
the
house
i
shall
have
much
to
tell
you
of
home
she
whispered
you
must
spare
me
much
time
though
you
will
first
be
so
eager
for
your
own
friend
we
shall
find
each
other
changed
i
know
have
both
seen
years
and
trouble
enough
but
you
must
tell
wallingford
i
have
had
no
such
happiness
in
many
a
year
as
the
sight
of
her
face
will
bring
me
and
dear
nancy
haggens
she
asked
holding
mary
back
while
the
merchant
grew
impatient
at
the
delay
of
their
whispering
she
is
yet
alive
and
mary
smiled
i
shall
tell
you
many
things
not
only
of
her
but
of
the
gay
major
she
replied
aloud
yes
i
am
coming
sir
but
it
is
like
home
here
and
i
am
so
happy
already
in
your
kind
house
then
they
walked
away
together
he
with
a
clinking
cane
and
majestic
air
and
kindly
showing
miss
hamilton
all
the
sights
of
bristol
that
they
passed
so
you
sailed
on
the
golden
dolphin
he
asked
as
they
reached
the
water
side
she
is
a
small
old
vessel
but
she
wears
well
she
has
made
this
port
many
a
time
before
said
john
davis
and
you
say
well
that
is
good
for
me
and
you
are
lucky
to
escape
the
thieving
privateers
out
of
your
own
harbors
so
madam
wallingford
has
borne
her
voyage
handsomely
you
think
what
becomes
of
her
young
son
english
t
is
all
an
old
man
can
do
to
say
his
prayers
for
his
country
late
that
evening
while
the
two
elder
ladies
kept
close
together
and
spoke
eagerly
of
old
days
and
friends
long
gone
out
of
sight
john
davis
sat
opposite
his
young
guest
at
the
fireplace
as
he
smoked
his
pipe
the
rich
room
was
well
lit
by
both
firelight
and
candles
and
held
such
peace
and
comfort
as
mary
never
had
cause
to
be
grateful
for
before
the
cold
dampness
of
the
brig
their
close
quarters
and
all
the
dullness
and
impatience
of
the
voyage
were
past
now
and
they
were
safe
in
this
good
english
house
among
old
friends
it
was
the
threshold
of
england
too
and
roger
wallingford
was
somewhere
within
soon
they
might
be
sailing
together
for
home
even
the
worst
remembrance
of
the
sea
was
not
unwelcome
with
this
thought
at
heart
the
voyagers
had
been
listening
to
sad
tales
of
the
poverty
and
distress
of
nearly
all
the
loyalist
refugees
from
america
the
sorrows
of
governor
hutchinson
and
his
house
and
of
many
others
the
sewalls
and
russells
the
faneuils
and
the
boutineaus
who
were
still
in
bristol
had
already
sent
eager
messages
mistress
davis
warned
her
guests
that
next
day
when
news
was
spread
of
their
coming
the
house
would
be
full
of
comers
and
goers
all
asking
for
news
and
most
of
them
for
money
too
some
were
now
in
really
destitute
circumstances
who
had
been
rich
at
home
and
pensions
and
grants
for
these
heartsick
loyalists
were
not
only
slow
in
coming
but
pitiful
in
their
meagreness
there
was
a
poor
gentleman
from
salem
and
his
wife
with
him
living
in
the
davises
house
they
had
lodged
upward
of
thirty
strangers
since
the
year
came
in
it
was
a
heavy
charge
upon
even
a
man
for
they
must
nearly
all
borrow
money
beside
their
food
and
shelter
madam
wallingford
was
not
likely
to
come
the
heavy
box
with
brass
scutcheons
which
the
captain
himself
had
escorted
from
the
golden
dolphin
late
that
afternoon
was
not
without
comfortable
reassurance
and
the
lady
had
asked
to
have
a
proper
english
chosen
for
her
as
she
did
not
wish
to
bring
a
weight
upon
the
household
but
there
were
other
problems
to
be
faced
this
good
merchant
davis
was
under
obligations
to
so
old
a
friend
and
he
was
not
likely
to
be
a
niggard
in
any
sense
when
she
did
him
the
honor
to
seek
his
hospitality
i
must
go
to
my
library
where
i
keep
my
business
matters
tis
but
a
plain
book
room
a
place
for
my
less
public
affairs
we
may
have
some
private
talk
there
if
you
are
willing
he
said
in
a
low
voice
and
mary
rose
at
once
and
followed
him
the
ladies
did
not
even
glance
their
way
though
the
merchant
carefully
explained
that
he
should
show
his
guest
a
very
great
ledger
which
had
been
brought
up
from
his
since
business
had
fallen
so
low
she
might
see
her
brother
s
name
on
many
of
the
pages
let
us
speak
frankly
now
he
urged
as
they
seated
themselves
by
as
bright
a
fire
of
blazing
coals
as
the
one
they
had
left
you
can
trust
me
with
all
your
troubles
said
the
fatherly
old
man
i
am
distressed
to
find
that
madam
wallingford
s
case
is
so
desperate
mary
looked
up
startled
from
the
peace
of
mind
into
which
she
had
fallen
do
you
know
anything
sir
she
begged
him
earnestly
is
it
likely
but
there
she
stopped
and
could
go
no
further
i
had
not
the
heart
to
tell
her
he
answered
but
we
have
already
some
knowledge
of
that
officer
of
the
ranger
who
was
left
ashore
at
whitehaven
he
has
been
reported
as
gravely
wounded
and
they
would
not
keep
him
in
any
jail
of
that
northern
region
but
sent
him
southward
in
a
dying
state
saying
that
he
should
by
rights
go
to
his
own
kind
in
the
mill
prison
you
must
be
aware
that
such
an
unprovoked
attack
upon
a
british
seaport
has
made
a
great
stir
among
us
added
the
merchant
with
bitterness
mary
remembered
the
burning
of
falmouth
in
her
own
province
and
was
silent
if
he
had
been
a
deserter
and
treacherous
at
heart
as
i
find
there
was
suspicion
he
continued
yes
even
if
his
own
proper
feelings
toward
the
king
had
mastered
your
lieutenant
i
do
not
know
that
his
situation
would
have
been
any
better
for
the
moment
they
must
lack
spirit
in
whitehaven
on
our
bristol
wharves
the
mob
would
have
torn
such
a
prisoner
limb
from
limb
you
must
remember
that
i
am
an
englishman
born
and
bred
and
have
no
patience
with
your
rebels
i
see
now
t
was
a
calmer
judgment
ruled
their
course
when
they
sent
him
south
but
if
he
is
yet
in
the
mill
prison
and
alive
he
could
not
be
in
a
worse
place
this
war
is
costing
the
king
a
fortune
every
week
that
it
goes
on
and
he
can
not
house
such
pirates
and
spies
in
his
castle
at
windsor
mary
s
eyes
flashed
she
was
keeping
a
firm
hold
upon
her
patience
i
think
from
what
we
are
told
of
the
mill
prison
that
the
king
has
gone
too
far
to
the
other
extreme
she
could
not
forbear
saying
but
with
perfect
quietness
well
we
are
not
here
to
talk
politics
said
the
alderman
uneasily
i
have
a
deep
desire
to
serve
so
old
and
respected
a
friend
as
this
young
man
s
mother
i
saw
the
boy
once
when
he
came
to
england
a
promising
lad
i
must
own
and
respectful
to
his
elders
i
am
ready
to
serve
him
if
i
can
for
his
father
s
sake
and
to
put
all
talk
of
principles
by
or
any
question
of
his
deserts
we
have
been
driven
to
the
necessity
of
keeping
watchers
all
along
the
by
night
and
day
to
send
alarm
by
beacons
into
our
towns
they
say
paul
jones
is
a
born
divil
and
will
stick
at
nothing
how
came
colonel
wallingford
s
son
to
cast
in
his
lot
with
such
a
gallows
rogue
if
you
had
lived
on
our
river
instead
of
here
in
bristol
you
would
soon
know
mary
answered
him
our
honest
industries
have
long
been
hindered
and
forbidden
we
are
english
folk
and
are
robbed
of
our
rights
well
well
my
dear
you
seem
very
clear
for
a
woman
but
i
am
an
old
man
and
hard
to
convince
your
brother
should
be
enough
he
is
a
man
of
judgment
but
how
such
men
as
he
have
come
to
be
so
mistaken
and
blind
it
is
parliament
that
has
been
blind
all
the
time
insisted
mary
if
you
had
been
with
us
on
that
side
of
the
sea
you
would
be
among
the
first
to
know
things
as
they
are
let
us
say
no
more
sir
i
can
not
lend
myself
to
argument
you
are
so
kind
and
i
am
so
very
grateful
for
it
in
my
heart
well
well
exclaimed
the
old
man
again
let
us
speak
then
of
this
instant
business
that
you
have
in
hand
i
take
it
you
have
a
heart
in
the
matter
too
i
see
that
you
cherish
madam
wallingford
like
her
own
child
we
must
find
out
if
the
lad
is
still
alive
and
whether
it
is
possible
to
free
him
i
heard
lately
that
they
have
had
the
worst
sort
of
among
them
and
a
jail
fever
that
is
worse
than
the
plague
itself
t
is
not
the
fault
of
the
jail
i
wager
you
but
some
dirty
sailor
brought
it
from
his
foul
ship
he
added
hastily
they
are
all
crowded
in
together
would
they
had
kept
at
home
where
they
belong
you
speak
hard
words
said
the
girl
impatiently
and
with
plain
reproach
but
looking
so
beautiful
in
her
quick
anger
that
the
old
man
was
filled
with
wonder
and
delight
before
his
conscience
reminded
him
that
he
should
be
ashamed
he
was
not
used
to
being
so
boldly
fronted
by
his
own
women
folk
though
his
wife
always
had
her
say
she
feared
and
obeyed
him
afterward
without
question
i
wish
that
this
foolish
tea
had
never
been
heard
of
it
has
been
a
most
detestable
weed
for
england
grumbled
the
old
merchant
they
say
that
even
your
indians
drink
it
now
or
would
have
it
if
they
could
davis
you
have
seen
something
of
our
young
country
said
the
girl
speaking
in
a
quiet
tone
you
have
known
how
busy
our
men
are
at
home
how
steadily
they
go
about
their
business
if
you
had
seen
as
i
did
how
they
stood
straight
and
dropped
whatever
they
had
in
hand
and
were
hot
with
rage
when
the
news
came
from
boston
and
we
knew
that
we
were
attacked
at
lexington
and
concord
you
would
have
learned
how
we
felt
the
bitter
wrong
t
was
not
the
loss
of
our
tea
or
any
trumpery
tax
we
have
never
been
wanting
in
generosity
or
hung
back
when
we
should
play
our
part
we
remembered
all
the
old
wrongs
our
own
timber
rotting
in
our
woods
that
we
might
not
cut
our
own
waterfalls
running
to
waste
by
your
english
law
lest
we
cripple
the
home
manufacturers
we
were
hurt
to
the
heart
and
were
provoked
to
fight
we
have
turned
now
against
such
tyranny
all
we
new
england
women
sat
at
home
and
grieved
the
cannon
sounded
loud
through
our
peaceful
country
they
shut
our
ports
and
we
could
not
stand
another
insult
without
boldly
resenting
it
we
had
patience
at
first
because
our
hearts
were
english
hearts
then
we
turned
and
fought
with
all
our
might
because
we
were
still
englishmen
and
there
is
plenty
of
fight
left
in
us
yet
you
are
beset
by
the
pride
of
being
independent
and
all
for
yourselves
davis
accused
her
our
hearts
are
wounded
to
the
quick
because
we
are
the
same
new
england
folk
who
fought
together
with
the
king
s
troops
at
louisburg
and
you
have
oppressed
us
said
mary
quickly
i
heard
that
john
adams
said
he
has
been
one
of
our
leaders
from
the
there
had
not
been
a
moment
since
the
beginning
of
hostilities
when
he
would
not
have
given
everything
he
possessed
for
a
restoration
to
the
state
of
things
before
the
contest
began
if
we
could
only
have
security
for
its
continuance
we
did
not
wish
to
separate
from
england
and
if
the
separation
has
come
it
is
only
from
our
sad
necessity
can
not
you
see
that
being
english
people
we
must
insist
upon
our
rights
we
are
not
another
race
because
we
are
in
another
country
tut
tut
my
dear
said
the
old
man
uneasily
what
does
a
pretty
girl
like
you
know
about
rights
so
that
s
the
talk
you
ve
listened
to
we
may
need
to
hear
more
of
it
you
sound
to
me
as
if
fox
had
all
along
been
in
the
right
and
knew
the
way
to
bring
back
our
trade
he
began
to
fidget
in
his
elbow
chair
and
to
mend
the
fire
i
can
t
go
into
all
this
i
have
had
a
wearying
day
began
to
make
faint
excuse
there
s
much
you
should
hear
on
england
s
side
you
only
know
your
own
and
this
war
is
costing
parliament
a
terrible
drain
of
money
do
you
know
anything
of
lord
newburgh
and
where
he
may
be
found
asked
mary
with
sudden
directness
my
lord
newburgh
repeated
davis
wonderingly
and
what
should
you
want
with
him
i
know
him
but
by
name
he
would
be
the
son
of
that
radcliffe
who
was
a
scotch
rebel
in
and
lost
his
head
by
it
too
he
was
brother
to
the
famous
lord
darwentwater
t
was
a
wild
family
an
unfortunate
house
what
seek
you
at
their
hands
mary
sat
looking
into
the
fire
and
did
not
answer
perhaps
you
can
send
some
one
with
me
toward
plymouth
she
asked
presently
and
trembled
a
little
as
she
spoke
she
had
grown
pale
though
the
bright
firelight
shone
full
in
her
face
the
captain
learned
when
we
first
came
ashore
that
lord
mount
edgecumbe
is
likely
to
be
commander
of
that
prison
where
our
men
are
the
mill
prison
they
said
it
was
above
plymouth
town
i
did
not
say
anything
to
madam
wallingford
lest
our
hopes
should
fail
but
if
you
could
spare
a
proper
person
to
go
with
me
i
should
like
to
go
to
plymouth
the
old
man
gazed
at
her
with
wonder
you
do
not
know
what
a
wild
goose
chase
means
then
my
little
lady
he
exclaimed
with
considerable
scorn
lord
mount
edgecumbe
you
might
as
well
go
to
windsor
expecting
a
morning
talk
and
stroll
in
the
park
along
with
the
king
t
is
evident
enough
one
person
is
the
same
as
another
in
your
colonies
but
if
you
wish
to
try
i
happened
to
hear
yesterday
that
the
great
earl
is
near
by
in
bath
where
he
takes
the
waters
for
his
gout
you
can
go
first
to
george
fairfax
of
virginia
with
whom
madam
wallingford
is
acquainted
she
has
told
me
that
already
he
is
of
a
noble
house
himself
fairfax
and
may
know
how
to
get
speech
with
these
gentlemen
why
yes
t
is
a
chance
indeed
and
we
might
achieve
something
davis
gave
a
satisfied
look
at
the
beautiful
face
before
him
and
nodded
his
sage
head
i
shall
go
with
you
myself
if
it
is
a
fair
day
tomorrow
he
assured
her
i
am
on
good
terms
with
fairfax
i
was
long
agent
here
for
their
tobacco
ships
the
old
lord
fairfaxes
of
virginia
but
all
that
rich
trade
is
good
as
done
and
he
gave
a
heavy
sigh
we
think
of
your
sailors
in
the
mill
prison
as
if
they
were
all
divils
you
won
t
find
it
easy
to
get
one
of
them
set
free
he
added
boldly
mary
gave
a
startled
look
and
drew
back
a
little
i
hear
the
king
is
glad
to
ship
them
on
his
she
said
and
that
the
mill
prison
is
so
vile
a
place
the
poor
fellows
are
thankful
to
escape
from
it
even
if
they
must
turn
traitor
to
their
own
cause
oh
sailors
are
sailors
grumbled
the
old
man
i
find
madam
wallingford
most
loyal
to
the
king
however
so
that
there
is
a
chance
for
her
and
she
is
no
beggar
or
pensioner
far
from
it
if
her
foolish
son
had
been
on
any
other
errand
than
this
of
the
ranger
s
she
might
easier
gain
her
ends
poor
lady
what
stands
in
the
way
you
may
ask
why
only
last
week
our
own
coast
was
in
a
panic
of
fear
john
davis
frowned
at
the
fire
so
that
his
great
eyebrows
looked
as
if
they
were
an
assaulting
battery
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
angrily
and
puffed
hard
at
his
pipe
but
it
had
gone
out
altogether
then
he
smiled
and
spoke
in
a
gentler
tone
yes
missy
we
ll
ride
to
bath
an
the
weather
should
be
fair
the
fresh
air
will
hearten
you
after
the
sea
and
we
can
talk
with
fairfax
and
see
what
may
be
done
i
m
not
afraid
to
venture
though
they
may
know
you
for
a
little
rebel
and
set
me
up
to
wear
a
wooden
ruff
all
day
in
the
pillory
for
being
seen
with
you
i
must
speak
ye
some
hard
words
the
old
man
added
unexpectedly
leaning
forward
and
whispering
under
his
breath
as
if
the
solid
oak
panels
might
let
his
forebodings
reach
a
mother
s
ears
in
the
room
beyond
the
young
man
may
be
dead
and
gone
long
before
this
if
he
was
put
into
the
mill
prison
while
yet
weak
from
his
wounds
if
he
is
there
and
alive
i
think
the
king
himself
would
say
he
could
not
let
him
out
there
s
not
much
love
lost
in
england
now
for
paul
jones
or
any
of
his
crew
stranger
at
would
that
she
had
told
us
of
the
trials
of
that
time
and
why
it
was
that
her
heart
rose
against
the
new
world
and
the
new
manners
to
which
she
had
come
the
next
morning
miss
hamilton
came
down
dressed
in
her
riding
gear
to
find
her
host
already
in
the
saddle
and
armed
with
a
stout
hunting
crop
which
he
flourished
emphatically
as
he
gave
some
directions
to
his
groom
the
day
was
fine
and
clear
after
a
rainy
night
with
a
hearty
fragrance
of
the
showery
summer
fields
blowing
through
the
bristol
streets
they
were
quick
outside
the
town
on
the
road
to
bath
mary
found
herself
well
mounted
though
a
little
too
safely
for
her
liking
her
horse
was
heavy
of
build
being
used
to
the
burden
of
a
somewhat
ponderous
master
but
the
lighter
weight
and
easy
prompting
hand
of
a
young
girl
soon
made
him
like
a
brave
colt
again
the
old
merchant
looked
on
with
approval
at
such
pretty
skill
and
acquaintance
with
horsemanship
as
his
companion
showed
at
the
outset
of
their
journey
and
presently
when
both
the
good
horses
had
finished
their
discreet
frolic
and
settled
to
sober
travel
he
fell
into
easy
discourse
and
showed
the
fair
rider
all
the
varied
interests
of
the
way
it
was
a
busy
thoroughfare
and
this
honored
citizen
was
smiled
at
and
handsomely
saluted
by
many
acquaintances
noble
and
humble
davis
was
stingy
of
holidays
even
in
these
dull
times
but
all
the
gallantry
he
had
ever
possessed
was
glowing
in
his
heart
as
he
rode
soberly
along
in
such
pleasant
company
the
dreary
suspense
and
anxiety
of
six
long
weeks
at
sea
were
like
a
dream
in
the
girl
s
own
mind
at
last
she
could
set
forth
about
her
business
the
sorrows
of
seafaring
were
now
at
an
end
she
was
in
england
at
last
and
the
very
heart
of
the
mother
country
seemed
to
welcome
her
yet
a
young
heart
like
mary
hamilton
s
must
needs
feel
a
twinge
of
pain
at
the
height
of
her
morning
s
happiness
the
fields
and
hedges
the
bright
foxglove
and
green
ivy
the
larks
and
blackbirds
and
quiet
robins
the
soft
air
against
her
cheeks
called
up
some
memory
some
instinct
of
old
relationship
all
her
elders
in
berwick
still
called
england
home
and
her
thrilled
heart
had
come
to
know
the
reason
roger
wallingford
had
lived
in
england
she
suddenly
understood
against
her
will
why
he
could
find
it
so
hard
to
go
to
sea
in
the
ranger
to
attack
these
shores
and
why
he
had
always
protested
against
taking
part
in
the
war
england
was
no
longer
an
angry
contemptuous
enemy
tyrannous
and
exacting
and
determined
to
withhold
the
right
of
liberty
from
her
own
growing
colonies
all
those
sad
familiar
prejudices
faded
away
and
mary
could
only
see
white
clouds
in
a
soft
sky
above
the
hazy
distance
and
hear
the
english
birds
singing
and
meet
the
honest
english
faces
like
old
friends
as
she
rode
along
the
road
there
was
some
witchery
that
bewildered
her
it
was
like
some
angry
quarrel
sprung
up
between
mother
and
child
while
they
were
at
a
distance
from
each
other
that
must
be
quick
forgotten
when
they
came
face
to
face
there
was
indeed
some
magic
touch
upon
her
the
girl
s
heart
was
beating
fast
she
was
half
afraid
that
she
had
misunderstood
everything
in
blaming
old
england
so
much
and
even
stole
a
quick
glance
at
her
companion
to
see
if
he
could
have
guessed
her
strange
thoughts
t
is
a
pretty
morning
said
davis
kindly
seeing
that
she
looked
his
way
we
shall
reach
bath
in
proper
season
and
he
let
his
horse
come
to
a
slow
walk
whether
it
was
the
fresh
air
of
the
summer
day
very
strengthening
to
one
who
had
been
long
at
sea
or
whether
it
was
the
justice
of
their
errand
itself
the
weakness
of
this
happy
moment
quickly
passed
and
miss
hamilton
s
hand
eagerly
sought
for
a
packet
in
the
bosom
of
her
gown
to
see
if
it
were
safe
the
reason
for
being
on
this
side
the
sea
was
the
hope
that
an
anxious
errand
could
be
well
done
she
thought
now
of
master
sullivan
on
his
bleak
new
england
hillside
of
the
far
blue
mountains
of
the
north
country
and
the
outlook
that
was
clearer
and
wider
than
this
hazy
landscape
along
the
avon
she
looked
down
at
the
tame
english
river
and
only
remembered
the
wide
stream
at
home
that
ran
from
the
mountains
straight
to
sea
it
roared
and
droned
over
the
great
rocky
fall
near
the
master
s
own
house
and
sounded
like
the
calling
sea
itself
in
his
ears
you
may
see
bath
now
there
in
the
valley
said
davis
pointing
with
his
big
hand
and
the
hunting
crop
t
is
as
fine
a
ride
from
bristol
to
bath
as
any
you
may
have
in
england
they
stopped
their
horses
a
little
short
of
breath
and
looked
down
the
rich
wooded
country
to
the
bright
town
below
t
is
a
fine
ride
indeed
said
mary
patting
her
horse
s
neck
and
thinking
with
uncontrollable
wistfulness
of
the
slenderer
and
less
discreet
young
duke
at
home
and
of
the
old
coachman
and
his
black
helpers
as
they
always
stood
by
the
stable
eager
to
watch
her
with
loud
cautions
as
she
rode
away
it
was
a
sharp
touch
of
homesickness
and
she
turned
her
head
so
that
she
could
hide
her
face
from
sight
i
ll
change
with
you
my
dear
as
we
ride
toward
home
i
see
you
are
so
competent
a
rider
offered
davis
heartily
lightfoot
is
a
steady
beast
though
i
must
own
you
found
him
otherwise
this
morning
this
chestnut
is
younger
and
he
had
a
strange
sense
as
he
spoke
that
mary
was
no
longer
in
good
spirits
perhaps
the
heavy
horse
had
tired
her
strength
though
lightfoot
was
as
good
a
creature
as
any
in
bristol
and
much
admired
for
his
noble
appearance
mary
eagerly
protested
and
patted
the
old
horse
with
still
greater
friendliness
and
approval
as
they
went
riding
on
toward
the
town
the
alderman
sighed
at
the
very
sight
of
her
youth
and
freshness
it
would
be
pleasant
to
have
such
a
daughter
for
his
own
a
man
likes
young
company
as
he
grows
older
though
the
alderman
might
be
growing
clumsy
on
his
own
legs
the
good
horse
under
him
made
him
feel
like
a
lad
of
twenty
this
was
a
fine
day
to
ride
out
from
bristol
and
the
weather
of
the
best
davis
began
to
mind
him
of
an
errand
of
business
to
westbury
on
trym
beyond
the
clifton
downs
where
on
the
morrow
he
could
show
miss
hamilton
still
finer
prospects
than
these
they
stopped
at
last
before
a
handsome
lodging
in
the
middle
of
the
town
of
bath
george
fairfax
was
a
virginian
of
old
lord
bryan
fairfax
s
near
kindred
a
man
of
great
wealth
and
a
hearty
loyalist
his
mother
a
cary
of
hampton
had
been
well
known
to
madam
wallingford
in
their
early
years
he
was
at
home
this
day
and
came
out
at
once
to
receive
his
guests
with
fine
hospitality
being
on
excellent
terms
of
friendship
with
the
old
merchant
they
greeted
each
other
with
great
respect
before
miss
hamilton
s
presence
was
explained
and
then
fairfax
s
smiling
face
was
at
once
clouded
he
had
been
the
hope
and
stay
of
so
many
distressed
persons
in
these
anxious
days
of
war
that
he
could
only
sigh
as
he
listened
it
was
evident
enough
that
however
charming
this
new
sufferer
and
applicant
might
be
their
host
could
but
regret
her
errand
yet
one
might
well
take
pleasure
in
her
lovely
face
even
if
she
must
be
disappointed
as
most
ladies
were
in
the
hope
of
receiving
an
instant
and
ample
pension
from
the
ministers
of
his
majesty
george
the
third
fairfax
with
great
courtesy
began
to
say
something
of
his
regrets
and
fears
but
we
do
not
ask
for
these
kind
favors
mary
interrupted
him
with
gentle
dignity
you
mistake
our
present
errand
sir
madam
wallingford
is
in
no
need
of
such
assistance
we
are
provided
with
what
money
we
are
like
to
need
as
our
good
friend
here
must
already
know
the
people
at
home
she
faltered
for
one
moment
before
she
could
go
on
it
was
indeed
thought
best
that
madam
wallingford
should
be
absent
for
a
time
but
she
was
glad
to
come
hither
for
her
son
s
sake
who
is
in
prison
we
have
come
but
to
find
him
and
to
set
him
free
and
we
ask
for
your
advice
and
help
here
is
her
letter
and
miss
hamilton
hesitated
and
blushed
with
what
seemed
to
both
the
gentlemen
a
most
pretty
confusion
i
ought
to
tell
you
think
you
should
know
sir
that
i
am
of
the
patriots
my
brother
was
with
general
washington
with
his
own
regiment
when
i
left
home
george
fairfax
bowed
ceremoniously
but
his
eyes
twinkled
a
little
and
he
took
instant
refuge
in
reading
the
letter
this
was
evidently
an
interesting
case
but
not
without
its
difficulties
the
young
gentleman
in
question
also
appears
to
be
a
patriot
he
said
seriously
as
he
looked
up
at
davis
in
miss
hamilton
s
presence
i
must
drop
our
usual
term
of
madam
wallingford
professes
herself
unshaken
in
her
hereditary
allegiance
to
the
crown
but
as
for
this
young
officer
her
son
i
am
astonished
to
find
that
he
has
been
on
board
the
ranger
with
that
paul
jones
who
is
the
terror
of
all
our
ports
now
and
the
chief
pest
and
scourge
of
our
commerce
here
in
england
t
is
a
distressed
parent
indeed
you
have
the
right
of
it
said
the
old
british
merchant
with
great
eagerness
and
reproach
davis
was
not
a
man
who
found
it
easy
to
take
the
humorous
point
of
view
it
seems
that
he
was
left
ashore
that
night
of
the
attack
upon
whitehaven
in
the
north
which
you
will
well
remember
he
was
caught
by
the
town
guard
you
know
that
we
captured
one
of
the
ranger
s
men
twas
this
same
young
officer
and
though
badly
wounded
he
was
ordered
to
the
mill
prison
and
is
said
to
have
arrived
in
a
dying
state
for
his
mother
s
sake
and
her
face
would
distress
any
man
s
heart
i
try
to
believe
that
he
is
yet
alive
and
lies
there
in
the
jail
but
t
is
a
sorry
house
of
correction
that
he
has
come
to
through
his
own
foolishness
they
say
he
is
like
to
have
been
hanged
already
good
god
what
a
melancholy
story
and
all
england
thinking
that
he
deserves
his
fate
exclaimed
fairfax
i
can
not
see
how
anything
can
be
done
there
is
but
one
gleam
of
hope
said
davis
who
had
not
sat
among
the
bristol
magistrates
in
vain
he
spoke
pompously
but
with
some
kindness
for
miss
hamilton
who
was
listening
sadly
enough
the
eager
bravery
of
her
face
all
gone
their
last
words
had
been
very
hard
to
bear
there
is
one
thing
to
add
the
story
reached
america
before
these
good
friends
left
that
young
wallingford
was
suspected
by
many
persons
on
board
the
ranger
of
still
holding
to
his
early
loyalist
principles
they
openly
accused
him
of
an
effort
to
betray
the
ship
into
our
hands
if
this
is
true
it
is
not
true
interrupted
miss
hamilton
and
both
the
gentlemen
looked
a
little
startled
no
it
is
not
true
she
repeated
more
calmly
it
is
not
a
proper
plea
to
make
if
he
should
never
be
set
free
we
must
think
of
his
mother
we
are
only
reviewing
the
situation
in
our
own
fashion
said
the
elder
man
frowning
a
stern
rebuke
at
her
but
she
would
have
her
way
davis
has
been
very
kind
in
the
matter
she
continued
when
we
were
speaking
together
last
night
he
told
me
that
lord
mount
edgecumbe
was
now
in
bath
and
would
have
great
influence
about
the
american
prisoners
that
is
true
said
fairfax
politely
but
i
do
not
possess
the
honor
of
his
lordship
s
acquaintance
and
i
fear
that
i
have
no
means
of
reaching
him
he
is
in
bad
health
and
but
lately
arrived
in
bath
to
take
the
waters
miss
hamilton
has
brought
letters
i
have
some
letters
given
me
by
an
old
friend
at
home
acknowledged
mary
the
writer
was
very
sure
that
they
would
be
of
use
to
us
do
you
happen
to
know
anything
of
lord
newburgh
sir
and
where
he
may
be
found
lord
newburgh
repeated
the
virginian
eagerly
with
a
quick
shake
of
his
head
and
a
sudden
frown
though
there
was
again
a
twinkle
of
merriment
in
his
eyes
mary
s
best
hopes
suddenly
fell
to
the
ground
she
was
aware
as
she
had
not
been
before
upon
how
slight
a
foundation
these
best
hopes
might
have
been
built
she
had
always
looked
up
to
master
sullivan
with
veneration
the
mystery
of
his
presence
was
like
an
enchantment
to
those
who
knew
him
best
but
he
had
been
a
long
lifetime
in
america
he
might
have
written
his
letters
to
dead
men
only
they
might
be
worth
no
more
than
those
withered
oak
leaves
of
last
year
that
were
fluttering
on
the
hedges
pierced
by
a
new
growth
there
was
a
pause
fairfax
s
face
seemed
full
of
pity
miss
hamilton
began
to
resent
his
open
show
of
sympathy
i
am
strangely
inhospitable
he
exclaimed
we
were
so
quick
at
our
business
that
i
forgot
to
offer
you
anything
sir
and
you
miss
hamilton
after
your
morning
s
ride
no
no
it
is
no
trouble
you
will
excuse
me
for
a
moment
i
am
like
to
forget
my
good
bringing
up
in
virginia
and
my
lady
is
just
now
absent
from
home
fairfax
quickly
left
the
room
the
alderman
sat
there
speechless
but
looking
satisfied
and
complacent
it
certainly
did
make
a
man
thirsty
to
ride
abroad
on
a
sunshiny
morning
and
his
ears
were
for
the
comfortable
clink
of
glasses
the
heavy
tray
presently
arrived
and
was
put
near
him
on
a
card
table
and
the
old
butler
with
his
pleasant
virginian
speech
was
eager
in
the
discharge
of
hospitality
fairfax
being
still
absent
and
mary
quite
at
the
end
of
her
courage
she
could
not
take
the
cool
draught
which
old
peter
offered
her
with
respectful
entreaties
as
if
he
were
cæsar
their
own
old
slave
she
tried
to
look
at
the
hunting
pictures
on
the
wall
but
they
blurred
strangely
was
something
the
matter
with
her
eyes
what
noble
jamaica
spirits
said
john
davis
looking
at
the
ceiling
with
affected
indifference
as
his
glass
was
being
replenished
did
your
master
grow
these
lemons
on
his
own
plantations
in
virginia
they
are
of
a
wondrous
freshness
he
added
politely
to
repeat
his
approval
of
such
an
entertainment
miss
hamilton
my
dear
you
forget
we
must
take
the
long
ride
back
again
to
bristol
i
fear
you
make
a
great
mistake
to
refuse
any
refreshment
at
good
peter
s
hands
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
fairfax
made
a
handsome
gentleman
precede
him
into
the
room
i
was
afraid
that
i
should
miss
this
noble
friend
he
said
gayly
he
might
have
been
taking
advantage
of
so
fine
a
morning
like
yourselves
here
is
my
lord
newburgh
miss
hamilton
this
is
lord
newburgh
himself
for
you
you
must
have
heard
of
the
honorable
davis
of
bristol
my
lord
of
their
great
merchants
i
have
told
you
already
that
miss
hamilton
brings
you
a
letter
and
that
she
hopes
for
your
interest
with
my
lord
mount
edgecumbe
my
dear
miss
hamilton
this
gives
me
great
pleasure
when
you
said
that
you
had
brought
such
a
letter
i
was
sure
at
last
that
there
was
one
thing
i
could
do
for
you
lord
newburgh
gravely
saluted
these
new
acquaintances
taking
quick
notice
of
the
lady
s
charm
and
smiling
over
his
shoulder
at
fairfax
s
excited
manner
he
waved
his
hand
in
kind
protest
to
check
peter
s
officious
approach
with
the
tray
of
glasses
so
you
have
a
letter
for
me
from
america
miss
hamilton
he
asked
bluntly
and
she
put
it
into
his
hand
lord
newburgh
gave
a
curious
look
at
the
carefully
written
address
and
turned
the
folded
sheet
to
see
the
seal
then
he
flushed
like
a
man
in
anger
and
bit
his
lip
as
he
looked
at
the
seal
again
and
started
back
as
he
stood
close
by
the
window
so
that
they
all
saw
him
then
he
tore
open
master
sullivan
s
letter
it
is
dated
this
very
last
month
he
cried
my
god
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
this
man
is
still
alive
lord
newburgh
s
thus
says
my
king
say
thou
to
harry
of
england
though
we
seemed
dead
we
did
but
sleep
what
man
asked
fairfax
and
davis
with
eager
curiosity
seeing
such
astonishment
upon
his
face
but
lord
newburgh
made
them
no
answer
until
he
had
read
the
letter
and
carefully
folded
it
again
they
saw
his
hands
tremble
he
stood
looking
blankly
at
the
two
men
and
miss
hamilton
as
if
he
were
in
doubt
what
to
say
t
is
like
one
risen
from
the
dead
he
told
them
presently
but
what
is
written
here
is
proof
enough
for
me
there
are
some
things
which
can
not
be
spoken
of
even
after
all
these
years
but
i
can
say
this
t
was
a
friend
of
my
poor
father
charles
radcliffe
and
of
his
brother
darwentwater
of
their
unlucky
company
sixty
years
ago
there
are
high
reasons
and
of
state
too
why
beyond
this
i
must
still
keep
silence
great
heavens
what
a
page
of
history
is
here
and
he
opened
the
letter
to
look
at
it
once
more
mount
edgecumbe
will
not
believe
me
he
said
as
if
to
himself
well
at
least
he
knows
something
of
those
old
days
too
he
will
be
ready
to
do
what
he
can
for
such
a
petitioner
as
this
but
we
must
be
careful
i
should
like
to
speak
with
miss
hamilton
alone
if
you
will
leave
us
here
together
gentlemen
said
lord
newburgh
with
quiet
authority
and
fairfax
and
the
alderman
disappointed
but
with
ready
courtesy
left
them
alone
in
the
room
do
you
know
the
writer
of
this
letter
madam
demanded
lord
newburgh
and
he
was
so
well
aware
of
the
girl
s
beauty
that
while
he
spoke
his
eyes
scarcely
left
her
face
t
is
true
he
speaks
your
name
here
and
with
affection
but
i
can
not
think
his
history
is
known
mary
smiled
then
and
answered
gently
to
her
acquaintance
with
the
master
and
her
deep
love
for
him
but
that
his
early
life
was
a
matter
of
conjecture
to
those
who
had
longest
been
his
neighbors
lord
newburgh
saw
with
approval
that
she
knew
more
than
she
was
ready
to
confess
he
has
followed
the
great
example
has
given
his
life
for
his
friend
said
lord
newburgh
who
showed
himself
much
moved
when
she
had
finished
speaking
they
should
know
of
this
among
our
friends
in
france
by
god
s
truth
the
king
himself
should
know
but
for
his
present
advisers
i
must
say
no
more
you
can
see
how
this
strange
news
has
shaken
me
he
asks
a
thing
difficult
enough
he
has
broken
his
long
silence
for
no
light
reason
but
mount
edgecumbe
will
feel
as
i
do
he
asks
should
be
promised
him
and
mount
edgecumbe
has
power
in
plymouth
even
with
barrington
reigning
in
the
war
office
he
is
not
likely
to
be
refused
though
barrington
is
a
narrow
soul
and
we
can
give
no
reasons
such
as
make
our
own
way
plain
your
man
shan
t
stay
in
the
mill
prison
i
can
promise
you
that
ranger
or
no
ranger
lord
newburgh
smiled
now
at
miss
hamilton
as
if
to
bring
a
look
of
pleasure
to
so
sweet
a
face
and
she
could
not
but
smile
back
at
him
i
shall
do
my
part
of
this
business
at
once
he
said
rising
i
passed
mount
edgecumbe
on
my
way
here
he
ll
swear
roundly
at
such
a
request
he
fears
again
that
his
great
oaks
must
go
down
and
his
temper
is
none
of
the
best
the
earl
is
an
old
sailor
my
dear
miss
hamilton
and
has
a
sailor
s
good
heart
but
this
will
stagger
him
well
you
say
that
madam
wallingford
the
young
man
s
mother
is
now
in
bristol
and
again
he
looked
at
the
letter
stay
before
i
speak
with
the
earl
i
should
like
to
hear
more
of
these
interesting
circumstances
i
must
say
that
my
own
sympathies
are
mainly
with
your
party
in
the
colonies
i
believe
that
the
king
has
been
made
a
tool
of
by
some
of
his
ministers
but
i
should
not
say
this
if
you
are
one
of
the
loyalist
refugees
why
no
my
dear
he
checked
himself
laughing
t
is
a
strange
confusion
i
can
not
think
you
are
for
both
hound
and
hare
it
was
near
an
hour
later
when
fairfax
fumbled
at
the
latch
to
see
if
he
might
be
of
service
and
was
politely
though
not
too
warmly
requested
to
enter
john
davis
had
grown
fretful
at
their
long
delay
but
miss
hamilton
and
lord
newburgh
were
still
deep
in
their
conversation
the
young
lady
herself
had
been
close
to
her
brother
s
confidence
and
was
not
ignorant
of
causes
in
this
matter
of
the
war
lord
newburgh
struck
his
fist
to
the
table
with
emphatic
approval
as
he
rose
and
told
the
two
gentlemen
who
entered
that
he
had
learned
at
last
what
all
england
ought
to
know
true
state
of
affairs
in
america
the
virginia
loyalist
looked
disturbed
and
showed
some
indifference
to
this
bold
announcement
come
fairfax
cried
the
guest
gayly
i
shall
have
arguments
enough
for
ye
now
i
can
take
the
patriot
side
with
intelligence
instead
of
what
you
have
persisted
in
calling
my
ignorant
prejudice
t
is
your
new
teacher
then
and
not
your
reasoning
powers
retorted
fairfax
and
they
both
fell
to
laughing
while
mary
fell
to
blushing
and
looking
more
charming
than
before
well
miss
hamilton
and
is
your
business
forwarded
then
we
must
be
off
the
day

well
squandered
already
said
john
davis
i
shall
first
take
miss
hamilton
to
our
good
housekeeper
for
a
dish
of
tea
before
she
rides
home
protested
the
host
kindly
i
am
grieved
that
my
lady
is
not
here
but
our
housekeeper
mullet
can
offer
the
dish
of
tea

stern
a
boston
patriot

not
forbid

try
the
jamaica
spirits
again

second
glass
may
be
better
than
the
first
mr
alderman
i

speak
with
my
friends
as
to
these
plymouth
affairs
and
do
my
best
for
you
lord
newburgh
kindly
assured
miss
hamilton
as
they
parted
you
shall
see
me
in
bristol
ah
this
letter
and
he
spoke
in
a
low
voice
it
has
touched
my
heart
to
think
that
you
know
so
well
our
sad
inheritance
my
poor
father
and
poor
darwentwater
every
one
here
knows
their
melancholy
fate
their
sad
honors
of
the
axe
and
block
but
there
were
things
covered
in
those
days
that
are
secrets
still
in
england
speaks
of
the
newgate
supper
to
me
twas
he
himself
who
saved
and
only
a
but
mary
could
not
hear
the
rest

must
see

he
continued
aloud
i

have
a
thousand
questions
to
put
to

and
many
messages
for
your
old
master
sullivan
god
bless
him
when
you
return
i
offer
you
my
friendship
for
his
sake
and
lord
newburgh
stood
with
bared
head
beside
the
horse
when
miss
hamilton
had
mounted
we
have
pleasant
dilston
hall
to
our
home
no
more
these
many
years
we
radcliffes
are
all
done
but
at
slindon
you
shall
be
very
welcome
i
shall
wait
upon
madam
wallingford
and
bring
her
what
good
comfort
i
can
the
alderman
was
warmed
by
fairfax
s
hospitalities
and
rode
beside
his
young
guest
as
proudly
as
if
he
were
the
lord
mayor
on
high
holiday
the
streets
of
bath
were
crowded
with
idle
gentlefolk
it
was
a
lovely
day
and
many
people
of
fashion
were
taking
the
air
as
well
as
the
famous
waters
this
was
a
fine
sight
for
a
new
england
girl
and
mary
herself
was
beheld
with
an
admiration
that
was
by
no
means
silent
their
horses
feet
clacked
sharply
on
the
cobblestones
as
if
eager
to
shorten
the
homeward
road
and
the
young
rider
sat
as
light
as
her
heart
was
now
the
errand
was
done
it
was
a
pretty
thing
her
unconsciousness
of
all
admiration
she
might
have
been
flitting
along
a
shady
road
under
the
pines
at
home
startling
the
brown
rabbits
and
keeping
a
steady
hand
on
the
black
duke
s
rein
to
be
ready
for
sudden
freaks
she
did
not
see
that
all
along
by
the
pump
room
they
were
watching
her
as
she
passed
she
was
taking
good
news
to
bristol
lord
newburgh
had
given
his
word
of
honor
that
roger
wallingford
should
be
pardoned
and
set
free
was
not
his
mother
a
great
lady
and
heartily
loyal
to
the
crown
was
there
not
talk
of
his
having
been
suspected
of
the
same
principles
on
board
the
american
privateer
it
must
be
confessed
that
lord
newburgh
s
face
had
taken
on
a
look
of
amused
assurance
when
these
facts
were
somewhat
unwillingly
disclosed
they
were
the
last
points
in
the
lieutenant
s
history
which
mary
herself
woidd
have
willingly
consented
to
use
even
as
a
means
of
deliverance
from
captivity
but
unknown
to
her
they
had
won
an
easy
promise
of
freedom
she
s
a
rebel
indeed
but
god
bless
me
i
don
t
blame
her
laughed
the
noble
lord
as
he
reflected
upon
their
conversation
it
was
not
in
his
loyal
heart
to
forget
his
heritage
whatever
might
fall
out
in
the
matter
of
those
distressed
seamen
who
now
suffered
in
the
mill
prison
no
man
could
fail
of
pleasure
in
doing
service
for
such
sweet
eyes
as
miss
mary
hamilton
s
there
were
some
private
reasons
why
he
could
go
boldly
to
ask
this
great
favor
and
lord
mount
edgecumbe
was
as
good
as
master
of
the
town
of
plymouth
both
by
land
and
sea
and
responsible
for
her
concerns
i
ll
make
him
ride
with
me
to
bristol
to
see
these
ladies
said
lord
newburgh
from
a
generous
heart
t
will
be
a
sweet
reward
he
may
take
my
word
for
it
bottom
of
these
let
us
pray
that
our
unconscious
benefactions
outweigh
our
unconscious
cruelties
the
order
for
lieutenant
wallingford
s
release
was
soon
in
hand
but
the
long
journey
across
country
from
bristol
to
plymouth
seemed
almost
as
long
as
all
the
time
spent
in
crossing
the
sea
from
the
morning
hour
when
the
two
elder
ladies
had
watched
miss
hamilton
and
her
kind
old
cavalier
ride
away
down
the
narrow
bristol
street
with
a
stout
man
servant
well
mounted
behind
them
until
the
day
they
were
in
sight
of
plymouth
hoe
each
minute
seemed
slower
than
the
last
it
was
a
pretty
journey
from
inn
to
inn
and
the
alderman
lent
himself
gayly
to
such
unwonted
holidays
while
mary
s
heart
grew
lighter
on
the
way
and
a
bright
impatient
happiness
began
to
bloom
afresh
in
her
cheeks
and
to
shine
in
her
eyes
they
reached
plymouth
town
at
nightfall
and
mary
was
for
taking
fresh
horses
and
riding
on
to
the
mill
prison
for
once
her
face
was
dark
with
anger
when
the
landlord
argued
against
such
haste
he
was
for
their
taking
supper
and
assured
the
travelers
that
not
even
the
mayor
of
plymouth
himself
could
knock
at
the
jail
gate
by
night
and
think
to
have
it
opened
miss
hamilton
turned
from
such
officious
speech
with
proud
indifference
and
looked
expectantly
at
her
companion
it
is
not
every
night
they
will
have
a
pardon
to
consider
she
said
in
a
low
voice
to
davis
we
carry
a
letter
from
my
lord
mount
edgecumbe
to
the
governor
of
the
prison
we
must
first
get
speech
with
the
guard
and
then
i
have
no
fear
the
innkeeper
looked
provoked
and
wagged
his
head
he
had
already
given
orders
for
a
bountiful
supper
and
was
not
going
to
let
a
rich
bristol
merchant
and
two
persons
beside
ride
away
without
paying
for
it
we
shall
not
be
long
away
said
mary
pleading
if
she
had
known
of
the
supper
she
would
have
added
that
they
might
bring
back
another
and
a
hungrier
guest
than
they
to
sit
at
table
the
alderman
was
irresolute
he
was
ready
to
succor
a
distressed
prisoner
being
a
good
christian
but
he
was
hungry
now
and
they
had
been
riding
all
day
at
a
quicker
pace
than
he
might
have
followed
if
alone
his
man
servant
just
come
into
the
inn
parlor
to
wait
for
orders
stole
a
meaning
glance
at
him
and
they
were
two
against
one
no
no
my
dear
t
is
a
good
bit
further
and
most
likely
we
should
have
our
ride
in
vain
i
know
the
rules
of
such
places
from
our
bristol
laws
at
home
the
governor
will
most
likely
be
here
in
the
town
rest
you
now
and
let
us
make
a
good
supper
and
start
again
betimes
in
the
morning
then
seeing
how
disappointed
and
even
determined
her
face
grew
and
that
she
looked
very
tired
i
am
an
old
man
you
must
remember
he
added
kindly
i
fear
that
i
am
spent
and
can
do
no
more
without
resting
she
was
silent
then
and
crossed
the
room
to
stand
by
the
window
there
was
a
voice
in
her
heart
that
begged
her
to
persist
to
go
on
alone
if
need
be
and
not
let
herself
be
hindered
in
her
quest
it
was
still
light
out
of
doors
the
long
twilight
of
the
english
summer
was
making
this
last
step
of
her
great
adventure
a
possibility
she
sighed
the
voice
within
still
warned
and
pleaded
with
her
who
are
you
the
girl
said
wonderingly
who
are
you
that
comes
and
helps
me
you
are
not
my
own
thought
but
some
one
wiser
than
i
who
would
be
my
friend
it
was
as
if
some
unseen
ministering
spirit
were
face
to
face
with
her
bringing
this
insistent
thought
that
she
hardly
dared
refuse
to
take
for
guidance
she
gazed
out
of
the
window
sunset
clouds
were
brightening
the
whole
sky
an
afterglow
was
on
the
moorland
hills
eastward
above
the
town
she
could
hear
the
roar
of
the
ocean
not
far
away
there
were
cheerful
voices
coming
up
the
street
and
the
citizens
were
all
abroad
with
their
comfortable
pipes
and
chatter
get
me
a
fresh
horse
and
a
man
to
follow
said
miss
hamilton
turning
again
to
face
the
room
the
landlord
himself
was
laying
the
white
cloth
for
supper
matthew
their
old
groom
was
stiffly
kneeling
and
pulling
off
his
master
s
riding
boots
and
they
all
three
looked
at
her
in
dismay
our
own
horses
are
done
miss
said
matthew
with
decision
i
have
none
i
can
let
you
from
my
stable
the
landlord
seconded
there
was
a
review
of
our
raw
recruits
for
america
and
i
had
to
empty
every
stall
the
three
best
horses
are
returned
with
saddle
galls
from
their
clumsy
ignorance
he
protested
boldly
mary
glanced
at
davis
and
was
still
unconvinced
but
all
her
determination
was
lost
when
she
saw
that
the
old
man
was
really
fatigued
well
it
was
only
one
night
more
and
she
must
not
insist
perhaps
they
were
right
and
her
ride
would
be
in
vain
at
least
she
could
send
a
messenger
and
to
this
proposal
the
landlord
readily
acceded
since
useless
or
not
it
would
be
a
shilling
in
his
pocket
and
a
slow
boy
could
carry
the
letter
which
the
young
lady
made
such
haste
to
write
she
stopped
more
than
once
with
trembling
fingers
and
trembling
heart
dearest
roger
and
the
written
words
made
her
blush
crimson
and
hold
her
face
closer
to
the
paper
dearest
roger
i
would
that
i
might
come
to
you
but
they
say
it
is
impossible
your
mother
is
in
bristol
and
awaits
you
there
john
davis
has
brought
me
hither
to
the
crown
inn
in
the
morning
we
shall
open
the
prison
door
for
you
oh
my
dear
roger
to
think
that
i
shall
see
you
at
last
when
can
we
have
the
answer
back
she
asked
and
the
landlord
told
her
smiling
that
it
would
be
very
late
if
indeed
there
were
any
answer
at
all
and
reminded
her
with
insolent
patience
that
he
had
already
told
her
they
would
not
open
their
prison
gates
for
lords
or
commons
to
any
one
who
came
by
night
you
may
send
the
answer
by
one
of
your
maids
to
the
lady
s
room
commanded
the
bristol
magnate
in
a
tone
that
chased
the
servile
smile
from
the
s
face
when
mary
waked
the
morning
sun
was
pouring
in
at
her
window
and
there
was
no
word
of
any
answer
old
matthew
had
spoken
with
the
young
messenger
and
brought
word
that
he
had
given
the
letter
to
one
of
the
watch
by
the
gate
who
had
taken
the
money
and
promised
to
do
his
best
to
put
the
message
into
wallingford
s
hands
that
night
when
they
changed
guard
we
might
have
been
here
last
night
why
t
is
but
a
step
said
john
davis
as
they
drew
near
the
dismal
prison
next
morning
but
his
young
companion
made
no
answer
he
could
not
guess
what
happy
fear
mingled
with
her
glad
anticipation
now
nor
how
her
certainties
and
apprehensions
were
battling
with
each
other
matthew
s
own
horse
and
another
that
he
led
for
wallingford
were
weighted
with
provisions
so
that
he
trudged
afoot
alongside
it
was
easy
to
hear
in
plymouth
town
how
the
american
prisoners
lacked
such
things
and
yet
mary
could
hardly
wait
now
to
make
the
generous
purchase
which
she
had
planned
she
could
not
know
all
that
matthew
had
learned
and
told
his
master
in
whispers
in
the
stable
yard
as
they
rode
nearer
to
the
prison
a
flaw
of
wind
brought
toward
them
all
the
horrible
odors
of
the
crowded
place
like
a
warning
of
the
distress
and
misery
within
though
it
was
so
early
there
were
many
persons
standing
outside
the
gates
some
of
them
were
jeering
at
the
sad
spectacle
and
some
talking
in
a
friendly
way
with
the
men
who
stood
within
happily
it
was
not
only
a
few
compassionate
americans
who
had
posted
themselves
here
to
give
what
they
could
of
food
and
succor
but
among
the
plymouth
folk
themselves
many
a
heart
was
wrung
with
pity
and
one
poor
old
body
had
toiled
out
of
the
town
with
a
basket
of
food
to
smuggle
through
the
bars
cakes
and
biscuit
of
a
humble
sort
enough
but
well
flavored
with
love
mary
saw
her
take
thread
and
needles
out
of
her
pocket
and
sit
down
on
the
ground
to
mend
some
poor
rags
of
clothing
my
own
lad
went
for
a
sailor
she
said
when
they
thanked
her
and
called
her
mother
there
was
long
delay
the
guards
pushed
back
the
crowd
again
and
again
one
must
stand
close
to
see
the
sights
within
all
at
once
there
was
a
cry
and
scuffling
among
the
idlers
as
some
soldiers
came
riding
up
one
of
them
bringing
an
old
horse
with
a
man
thrown
across
the
saddle
and
tied
down
as
they
loosed
him
he
slid
heavily
to
the
ground
as
if
he
were
dead
and
the
spectators
closed
about
him
mary
hamilton
could
only
look
on
in
horror
and
apprehension
her
companion
was
in
the
midst
of
the
pushing
crowd
t
was
a
prisoner
who
escaped
last
night
and
has
been
retaken
he
said
hastily
as
he
returned
to
her
side
you
may
stay
here
with
matthew
my
dear
while
i
take
our
letters
and
go
in
i
see
that
it
is
no
place
for
you
they
are
like
wild
beasts
i
must
go
too
said
mary
you
will
not
forbid
me
now
good
heavens
she
cried
aloud
now
that
they
stand
away
from
the
gate
i
can
see
within
oh
the
poor
prisoners
oh
i
can
not
bear
their
sick
faces
they
are
starving
sir
these
must
be
the
men
who
had
the
fever
you
told
me
of
i
wish
we
had
brought
more
wine
and
food
to
these
poor
fellows
let
us
go
in
at
once
she
cried
again
and
was
in
a
passion
of
pity
and
terror
at
the
sight
let
us
go
in
let
us
go
in
she
begged
oh
you
forget
that
they
are
my
own
countrymen
i
can
not
wait
the
guard
now
returned
with
a
message
and
the
alderman
gave
his
bridle
to
the
groom
mary
was
afoot
sooner
than
he
and
had
run
to
the
gate
pushing
her
way
among
the
idle
sightseers
to
the
heavy
grating
they
were
calling
from
both
sides
of
the
gate
to
old
matthew
who
was
standing
with
the
horses
to
come
up
and
give
them
what
he
had
brought
mary
hamilton
felt
as
if
she
were
among
wolves
they
did
not
listen
they
did
not
wait
to
find
what
she
had
to
say
for
love
of
god
give
me
a
shilling
for
a
little
baccy
my
lady
said
one
voice
in
her
ear
i
ll
fetch
them
the
baccy
from
the
town
poor
boys
they
lack
it
most
of
anything
and
he
ll
drink
the
money
protested
an
old
beggar
woman
at
her
side
go
in
they
ll
let
no
ladies
in
and
she
gave
a
queer
laugh
and
if
you
re
once
in
all
you
ll
pray
for
is
to
be
out
again
and
forget
the
sight
the
governor
was
in
his
room
which
had
a
small
grated
window
toward
the
prison
yard
but
there
was
a
curtain
before
it
and
he
looked
up
anxiously
to
see
if
this
were
close
drawn
as
his
early
guests
entered
this
task
of
jailer
was
a
terrible
duty
for
any
man
and
he
swore
under
his
breath
at
lord
mount
edgecumbe
for
interfering
with
what
at
best
was
an
impossible
piece
of
business
if
he
had
seen
to
it
that
they
had
decent
supplies
for
the
prison
and
hanged
a
score
of
their
purveyors
and
contractors
now
or
had
blown
the
whole
rotten
place
into
the
air
with
his
fleet
guns
t
were
a
better
kindness
the
clerk
stood
waiting
for
orders
show
them
in
then
these
people
he
grumbled
and
made
a
feint
of
being
busy
with
some
papers
as
miss
hamilton
and
her
escort
appeared
the
governor
saw
at
once
that
the
honorable
davis
was
a
man
of
consequence
my
lord
mount
edgecumbe
writes
me
that
you
would
make
inquiries
for
a
prisoner
here
said
the
old
soldier
less
roughly
because
the
second
guest
proved
to
be
a
lady
and
most
fair
to
see
she
looked
very
pale
and
was
watching
him
with
angry
eyes
as
she
had
crossed
the
prison
yard
she
had
seen
fewer
miseries
because
her
tears
had
blinded
her
there
had
been
one
imploring
voice
calling
her
by
her
own
name
stop
miss
hamilton
stop
for
god
s
sake
some
one
had
cried
but
the
guard
had
kept
the
poor
prisoners
off
and
an
attendant
hurried
her
along
by
force
when
she
would
gladly
have
lingered
the
horror
of
it
all
was
too
much
for
her
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
ever
been
in
a
jail
i
am
fearful
of
your
sad
disappointment
madam
said
the
governor
of
the
prison
you
wished
to
see
lieutenant
roger
wallingford
i
grieve
to
say
spoke
kindly
but
looked
to
ward
mary
and
stopped
and
then
sighing
heavily
turned
his
eyes
toward
davis
with
a
kind
of
relief
he
is
not
dead
i
hope
sir
asked
the
old
man
for
mary
could
not
speak
we
have
the
order
for
his
release
no
he
is
not
dead
to
any
certain
knowledge
explained
the
governor
more
slowly
than
before
but
he
was
one
of
a
party
that
made
their
escape
from
this
prison
last
night
t
was
through
one
of
their
silly
tunnels
that
they
dig
they
have
some
of
them
been
shot
down
and
one
i
hear
has
just
been
taken
and
brought
in
alive
but
wallingford
s
name
is
not
among
any
of
these
he
turned
to
some
records
and
then
went
to
the
grated
window
and
looked
out
but
pulled
the
curtain
across
it
impatiently
as
he
came
away
you
brought
his
pardon
the
governor
then
asked
brusquely
i
should
think
he
would
be
the
last
man
for
a
pardon
why
he
was
with
paul
jones
sir
but
a
very
decent
fellow
a
gentleman
they
tell
me
i
did
not
see
him
i
am
not
long
here
this
young
lady
had
best
go
back
to
the
inn
and
he
stole
a
look
at
mary
who
sat
in
despairing
silence
a
strange
flush
had
replaced
her
first
pallor
she
had
thought
but
a
moment
before
that
she
should
soon
look
again
into
roger
wallingford
s
face
and
tell
him
that
he
was
free
on
the
end
of
the
governor
s
writing
table
lay
the
note
that
she
had
written
with
such
a
happy
heart
only
the
night
before
of
straying
nona

his
age
saw
visions
though
his
youth
dream
d
dreams
the
town
of
bristol
was
crowded
with
loyalist
refugees
some
who
had
fled
the
colonies
for
honest
love
of
their
king
and
some
who
believed
that
when
the
king
s
troops
had
put
down
the
rebellion
they
should
be
well
rewarded
for
holding
to
his
cause
they
were
most
of
them
cut
off
from
what
estates
they
may
have
had
and
were
begging
for
pensions
from
a
government
that
seemed
cruelly
indifferent
their
sad
faces
fairly
shadowed
the
bristol
streets
while
many
of
them
idled
the
day
through
discussing
their
prospects
with
one
another
and
killing
time
that
might
have
been
lived
to
some
profit
the
disappointment
of
their
hope
was
unexpected
and
an
england
that
showed
them
neither
sympathy
nor
honor
when
they
landed
on
her
shores
glowing
with
was
but
a
sad
astonishment
england
their
own
mother
country
seemed
fallen
into
a
querulous
dotage
with
her
king
s
ministers
so
pompous
in
their
stupid
ignorance
and
and
her
best
statesmen
fighting
hard
to
be
heard
it
was
an
age
of
gamester
heroes
and
of
reckless
living
a
poor
page
of
english
history
was
unfolded
before
their
wistful
eyes
these
honest
loyalists
were
made
to
know
the
mortified
feelings
of
country
gentlefolk
come
unheralded
to
a
city
house
that
was
busy
with
its
splendors
on
a
feast
day
and
impatient
of
what
was
inopportune
worse
than
this
though
judge
curwen
and
other
loyal
americans
of
his
company
were
still
hopeful
of
consideration
and
of
being
warmly
received
by
england
as
her
own
true
children
they
were
oftener
held
guilty
of
the
vexing
behavior
of
their
brothers
those
rebels
against
english
authority
whom
they
had
left
behind
something
to
mary
s
wonder
madam
wallingford
would
have
few
of
them
to
friend
she
was
too
great
a
person
at
home
to
consent
even
now
to
any
social
familiarity
on
the
score
of
political
sympathies
she
was
known
to
have
brought
much
money
and
it
was
made
easy
for
her
to
share
this
with
one
and
another
distressed
acquaintance
or
friend
s
friend
but
while
this
was
done
with
generosity
she
showed
herself
more
and
more
impatient
of
their
arguments
even
of
those
plaints
which
were
always
ready
and
the
story
of
such
grievances
as
had
led
them
into
exile
i
am
too
ill
and
sad
to
listen
to
these
things
she
said
often
even
to
her
friends
the
pepperrells
who
came
from
london
to
visit
her
i
only
know
my
country
s
troubles
through
my
own
sorrow
she
begged
them
at
last
to
find
poor
roger
s
grave
so
she
might
go
there
to
pray
for
him
t
was
all
that
she
could
do
oh
no
she
would
say
mournfully
to
those
who
looked
for
her
assent
to
their
own
views
of
the
great
situation
do
not
expect
me
to
understand
you
i
am
only
a
mother
and
all
my
life
is
done
the
bristol
streets
were
busy
as
miss
hamilton
came
walking
through
the
town
and
the
bells
were
ringing
for
a
holiday
she
was
deep
in
anxious
thought
and
kept
steadily
on
her
way
toward
the
abbey
church
without
even
a
glance
at
a
tradesman
s
window
or
a
look
at
the
people
she
met
life
was
filled
with
new
anxieties
since
the
day
when
they
had
left
plymouth
they
could
find
no
trace
of
roger
wallingford
beyond
the
certainty
that
he
had
made
his
escape
with
some
fellow
prisoners
through
a
tunnel
which
they
had
been
for
many
days
digging
under
the
prison
wall
there
had
been
a
light
near
the
opening
in
the
field
outside
and
a
guard
set
but
six
men
had
gone
out
of
the
narrow
hole
and
crawled
away
it
was
a
windy
night
and
the
lantern
light
and
shadows
wavered
on
the
ground
and
hid
them
two
were
shot
and
killed
but
two
were
captured
and
brought
back
at
once
while
another
was
shot
and
got
away
stumbling
and
falling
often
and
bleeding
like
a
slaughtered
creature
as
the
watch
could
see
next
morning
by
daylight
this
poor
fellow
had
escaped
to
the
moors
there
was
a
pool
of
blood
in
a
place
where
he
must
have
hidden
for
some
hours
among
the
furze
bushes
there
was
so
large
a
bounty
paid
for
any
escaped
traitors
and
felons
like
these
who
might
be
brought
back
alive
to
the
mill
prison
that
the
poor
moorland
folk
back
of
plymouth
were
ever
on
the
quest
roger
wallingford
might
have
been
that
bleeding
man
they
would
not
dare
to
keep
together
his
companion
might
have
left
him
dying
or
dead
somewhere
in
the
lonely
waste
country
that
stretched
miles
away
above
the
prison
his
fate
was
sure
if
he
should
be
captured
he
was
not
a
man
to
yield
his
life
too
easily
there
were
some
carefully
worded
notices
posted
which
might
easily
reach
the
eyes
of
such
fugitives
if
they
ventured
into
any
of
the
devon
towns
near
by
but
they
might
well
have
starved
to
death
by
this
time
in
the
deserts
of
dartmoor
one
sailor
beside
the
lieutenant
had
succeeded
in
making
his
escape
mary
hamilton
had
left
her
lady
pale
and
in
tears
that
morning
and
all
her
affectionate
solicitude
had
been
in
vain
there
was
some
relief
in
finding
herself
afoot
in
the
fresh
air
for
the
first
time
she
wondered
if
they
must
yield
all
their
hopes
and
think
of
going
home
it
must
be
so
if
they
should
come
to
know
that
roger
was
really
dead
and
her
heart
stopped
as
if
with
a
sudden
shock
alas
next
moment
she
remembered
that
for
poor
madam
wallingford
there
was
no
safe
return
her
son
was
not
yet
disproven
of
tory
crimes
if
there
were
any
chance
of
sailing
the
poor
lady
was
far
too
ill
and
feeble
in
these
last
days
the
summer
the
little
that
was
left
of
it
looked
long
and
dreary
the
days
were
already
growing
short
there
had
not
come
a
word
from
home
since
they
sailed
there
was
no
longer
much
use
in
riding
abroad
on
futile
quests
and
in
these
last
days
most
persons
had
ceased
to
ask
if
there
were
any
news
of
the
lieutenant
week
after
week
had
gone
by
and
his
mother
s
proud
courage
was
gone
while
her
bodily
strength
was
fast
failing
lord
newburgh
and
fairfax
even
lord
mount
edgecumbe
himself
had
shown
very
great
kindness
in
so
difficult
a
matter
and
mary
never
let
them
go
away
unthanked
for
any
favors
which
it
could
only
be
a
happiness
for
any
man
to
bestow
the
gift
and
spell
of
beauty
were
always
hers
and
a
heart
that
was
always
ready
to
show
both
gratitude
and
affection
she
might
not
speak
these
things
but
she
was
instant
in
giving
the
sweetest
recognition
to
the
smallest
service
that
she
might
discover
the
abbey
church
of
augustine
was
cool
and
dim
as
mary
hamilton
went
in
with
a
drooping
head
and
a
heavy
heart
her
courage
had
never
before
seemed
so
utterly
to
fail
she
had
passed
two
forlorn
royalists
at
the
gatehouse
who
were
talking
of
their
pensions
and
heard
one
of
them
say
if
i
were
safe
home
again
i
d
never
leave
it
principles
or
no
principles
and
the
words
rang
dull
and
heavy
in
her
ears
she
sat
down
on
an
old
stone
bench
in
the
side
aisle
the
light
came
sifting
down
to
the
worn
stone
pavement
but
she
was
in
shadow
behind
a
great
pillar
that
stood
like
a
monstrous
tree
to
hold
the
lofty
roof
there
was
no
one
in
sight
the
lonely
girl
looked
up
at
a
familiar
old
jacobean
monument
on
the
wall
with
the
primly
ruffed
father
and
mother
kneeling
side
by
side
with
clasped
hands
and
their
children
kneeling
in
a
row
behind
them
down
to
the
very
least
in
a
pious
little
succession
they
were
all
together
there
in
comfortable
safety
and
many
ancient
tablets
covered
the
walls
about
them
with
the
names
and
virtues
of
soldiers
and
sailors
priests
and
noblemen
and
gallant
gentlemen
of
old
england
with
their
children
and
their
good
wives
they
have
all
won
through
whispered
mary
to
herself
they
have
all
fought
the
long
battle
and
have
carried
care
like
me
and
they
have
all
won
through
i
shall
not
be
a
coward
either
and
her
young
heart
rose
but
still
the
tears
kept
coming
and
she
sat
bowed
in
the
shadow
and
could
not
lift
her
head
which
until
lately
had
faced
the
sun
like
a
flower
she
sat
there
at
last
not
thinking
of
her
present
troubles
but
of
home
of
old
peggy
and
the
young
maids
who
often
sang
at
their
pleasant
work
the
great
river
at
full
tide
with
its
wooded
shores
and
all
its
points
and
bays
the
fishing
weirs
in
the
distance
the
slow
swaying
flight
of
the
eagles
and
the
straight
course
of
the
herons
overhead
she
thought
of
the
large
quiet
house
facing
southward
and
its
rows
of
elms
and
the
slender
poplars
going
down
the
garden
terraces
she
even
heard
the
drone
of
the
river
falls
she
saw
the
house
standing
empty
all
the
wide
doors
shut
to
their
old
hospitality
a
sense
of
awful
distance
fell
upon
her
heart
the
responsibility
and
hopelessness
of
her
errand
were
too
heavy
on
her
young
heart
she
covered
her
face
and
bent
still
lower
but
she
could
not
stop
her
tears
there
came
the
sound
of
footsteps
up
the
nave
it
might
be
the
old
verger
in
his
rusty
gown
or
some
sightseer
stopping
here
and
there
to
read
an
inscription
poor
mary
s
tears
would
have
their
way
to
one
of
her
deep
nature
weeping
was
sad
enough
in
itself
to
cry
for
sorrow
s
sake
was
no
common
sorrow
she
was
safe
in
her
dim
corner
and
thought
little
of
being
seen
she
was
only
a
poor
girl
in
sore
trouble
with
her
head
sunk
in
her
hands
who
could
not
in
any
way
concern
a
stranger
the
wandering
footsteps
stopped
near
by
instead
of
going
on
and
entering
the
choir
she
noticed
then
in
a
dull
way
the
light
echo
of
their
sound
among
the
arches
overhead
my
god
said
a
man
s
voice
as
if
in
great
dismay
the
speaker
stepped
quickly
to
mary
s
side
and
laid
his
hand
gently
on
her
shoulder
she
looked
up
into
the
face
of
captain
paul
jones
of
the
ranger
and
manly
look
on
his
honour
that
bears
no
stamp
of
time
no
wrinkles
on
it
no
sad
demolishment
nor
death
can
reach
it
o
my
dear
better
angel
and
my
star
my
earthly
sight
needs
yours
your
heavenly
mine
the
captain
s
eyes
were
full
of
tears
it
was
no
sign
that
he
lacked
manliness
to
find
miss
hamilton
in
england
to
find
her
alone
and
in
piteous
despair
was
the
opportunity
of
his
own
heart
he
could
not
but
be
startled
into
wondering
silence
the
event
was
too
astonishing
even
for
one
so
equal
to
emergencies
but
he
stood
ready
with
beating
heart
and
sure
sense
of
a
man
s
abundant
strength
to
shelter
her
and
to
fight
against
the
thing
that
troubled
her
whatever
it
might
be
presently
he
seated
himself
by
mary
s
side
and
took
her
hand
in
his
and
held
it
fast
still
without
speaking
she
was
the
better
for
such
friendliness
and
yet
wept
the
more
for
his
very
sympathy
the
captain
waited
until
her
passion
of
tears
had
spent
itself
it
was
a
pity
she
could
not
watch
his
compassionate
face
all
that
was
best
and
kindest
in
the
man
was
there
to
see
with
a
grave
look
born
of
conflict
and
many
grievous
disappointments
to
see
paul
jones
now
one
could
not
but
believe
him
capable
of
the
sternest
he
had
at
least
the
unassuming
and
quiet
pride
of
a
man
who
knows
no
master
save
himself
his
eyes
were
full
of
womanly
tenderness
as
he
looked
down
at
the
pathetic
bowed
head
beside
him
next
moment
they
had
a
keen
brightness
as
he
caught
sight
of
a
tablet
on
the
abbey
wall
to
some
bristol
hero
long
dead
gallant
servant
through
many
perils
by
sea
and
land
of
anne
his
queen
it
was
a
record
that
the
captain
s
heart
could
perfectly
understand
calm
yourself
now
my
dearest
girl
he
said
at
last
with
gentle
authority
i
must
not
stay
long
beside
you
i
am
always
in
danger
here
i
was
not
unknown
in
bristol
as
a
younger
man
mary
lifted
her
head
for
a
moment
the
sight
of
his
face
helped
to
put
her
own
miseries
quite
out
of
mind
her
ready
sympathy
was
quickly
enough
roused
when
she
saw
how
paul
jones
had
changed
he
had
grown
much
older
years
might
have
passed
instead
of
months
since
that
last
evening
he
had
spent
in
america
when
she
had
seen
him
go
away
with
his
men
by
moonlight
down
the
river
now
more
than
ever
he
might
easily
win
the
admiration
of
a
woman
s
heart
she
had
half
forgotten
the
charm
of
his
voice
the
simple
directness
of
his
eyes
and
their
strange
light
with
something
in
his
behavior
that
men
called
arrogance
and
willful
rivalry
and
women
recognized
as
a
natural
royalty
and
irresistible
compelling
power
to
men
he
was
too
imperious
to
women
all
gentleness
and
courtesy
you
are
in
disguise
she
exclaimed
amazed
at
his
courage
how
do
you
dare
even
you
to
be
here
in
bristol
in
broad
day
and
she
found
herself
smiling
in
spite
of
her
unchecked
tears
the
captain
held
a
rough
woolen
cap
in
his
hand
he
was
dressed
in
that
poor
garb
of
the
hungry
spanish
sailor
of
quiberon
which
had
so
often
done
him
good
service
tell
me
what
has
brought
you
here
he
answered
that
is
by
far
the
greatest
wonder
i
am
no
fit
figure
to
sit
beside
you
but
t
is
the
hand
of
god
that
has
brought
us
here
together
heaven
forbid
that
you
should
ever
shed
such
bitter
tears
again
he
said
devoutly
and
sat
gazing
at
her
like
a
man
in
a
day
dream
sometimes
god
wills
that
we
shall
be
but
when
he
sends
the
comfort
of
a
friend
god
himself
can
do
no
more
answered
the
girl
and
there
fell
a
silence
between
them
there
was
a
sparrow
flying
to
and
fro
among
the
pillars
and
chirping
gayly
under
the
high
roof
tiny
note
and
full
of
busy
cheer
the
late
summer
sunshine
lay
along
the
floor
of
that
ancient
house
of
god
where
mary
and
the
captain
sat
alone
together
and
there
seemed
to
be
no
other
soul
in
the
place
her
face
was
shining
brighter
and
brighter
at
last
at
last
she
could
know
the
truth
and
hear
what
had
happened
at
whitehaven
and
ask
for
help
where
help
could
be
surely
given
but
why
are
you
here
you
must
indeed
be
bold
my
lord
captain
she
ventured
again
in
something
very
like
the
old
gay
manner
that
he
knew
yet
she
still
looked
very
white
except
for
her
eyes
there
were
new
tales
of
your
seafaring
told
in
the
town
only
yesterday
i
believe
they
are
expecting
you
in
every
corner
of
england
at
once
and
every
flock
of
their
shipping
is
dreading
a
sight
of
the
sea
wolf
i
do
my
own
errands
is
all
replied
the
captain
soberly
my
poor
ranger
is
lying
now
in
the
port
of
brest
i
am
much
hampered
by
enemies
but
i
shall
presently
break
their
nets
i
was
for
a
look
at
their
shipping
here
and
how
well
they
can
defend
it
there
is
a
able
out
of
roscoff
on
the
breton
coast
which
serves
me
well
on
these
expeditions
i
have
a
plan
later
for
doing
great
mischief
to
their
baltic
fleet
i
had
to
bring
the
worst
of
my
ship
s
company
with
me
t
is
my
only
discomfort
said
paul
jones
with
bitterness
i
have
suffered
far
too
much
and
he
sighed
heavily
and
changed
his
tone
i
believe
now
that
god
s
providence
has
brought
me
to
your
side
such
happiness
as
this
makes
up
for
everything
you
remember
that
i
have
been
a
sailor
all
my
life
he
continued
as
if
he
could
not
trust
himself
to
speak
with
true
feeling
i
have
been
acquainted
since
childhood
with
these
english
ports
you
did
not
know
that
i
had
come
to
bristol
said
mary
oh
yes
we
have
been
here
these
many
weeks
now
and
she
also
sighed
how
should
i
know
asked
paul
jones
impatiently
i
am
overwhelmed
by
such
an
amazing
discovery
i
could
burst
into
tears
i
am
near
to
being
unmanned
though
you
do
not
suspect
it
think
dear
think
what
it
is
to
me
i
have
no
discretion
either
when
i
babble
my
most
secret
affairs
aloud
and
hardly
know
what
i
am
saying
i
must
leave
you
in
a
few
short
moments
what
has
brought
you
here
tell
me
the
truth
and
how
i
may
safely
manage
to
see
you
once
again
if
you
were
only
in
france
with
my
dear
ladies
there
they
would
love
and
cherish
you
with
all
their
kind
hearts
t
is
the
duchess
of
chartres
who
has
been
my
good
angel
since
i
came
to
france
and
another
most
exquisite
being
whom
i
first
met
at
her
house
royal
princess
too
oh
i
have
much
to
tell
you
their
generous
friendship
and
perfect
sympathy
alone
have
kept
me
from
sinking
down
i
have
suffered
unbelievable
torture
from
the
jealousy
and
ignorance
of
men
who
should
have
known
their
business
better
and
given
me
every
aid
i
am
thankful
you
have
such
friends
as
these
ladies
said
mary
with
great
sweetness
i
am
sure
that
you
have
been
a
good
friend
to
them
some
knowledge
of
your
difficulties
had
reached
us
before
we
left
home
but
as
you
know
intercourse
is
now
much
interrupted
and
we
were
often
uncertain
of
what
had
passed
at
such
a
distance
we
hear
nothing
from
home
either
she
added
mournfully
we
are
in
great
distress
of
mind
you
could
see
that
i
was
not
very
cheerful
i
fear
in
my
heart
that
poor
madam
wallingford
will
die
madam
wallingford
repeated
the
captain
you
can
not
mean
that
she
is
here
he
exclaimed
with
blank
astonishment
his
tone
was
full
of
reproach
and
even
resentment
poor
lady
i
own
that
i
have
had
her
in
my
thoughts
and
could
not
but
pity
her
natural
distress
he
added
with
some
restraint
and
then
burst
forth
into
excited
speech
there
is
no
need
that
they
should
make
a
tool
of
you
who
are
a
patriot
and
hamilton
s
own
sister
this
is
arrant
foolishness
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
stood
before
miss
hamilton
with
his
eyes
fixed
angrily
upon
her
face
if
i
could
tell
you
everything
oh
i
am
outdone
with
this
he
cried
with
a
gesture
of
contempt
captain
paul
jones
she
said
rising
quickly
to
confront
him
i
beg
you
to
tell
me
everything
i
can
not
believe
that
roger
wallingford
is
a
traitor
and
i
love
his
mother
almost
as
if
she
were
my
own
i
came
to
england
with
her
of
my
own
wish
and
free
will
and
because
it
was
my
right
to
come
will
you
tell
me
plainly
what
has
happened
and
why
you
do
not
take
his
part
the
captain
s
quick
change
from
such
deep
sympathy
as
he
had
shown
for
her
tears
to
a
complete
scorn
of
their
cause
could
only
give
a
sad
shock
to
mary
hamilton
s
heart
he
was
no
helper
after
all
there
came
a
dizzy
bewilderment
like
a
veil
over
her
mind
it
seemed
as
if
she
felt
the
final
blow
of
fate
she
had
not
known
how
far
she
had
spent
her
strength
or
how
her
very
homesickness
had
weakened
her
that
day
i
fear
it
is
true
enough
that
he
betrayed
us
at
whitehaven
said
paul
jones
slowly
and
not
unmindful
of
her
piteous
look
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
doubt
him
at
first
indeed
i
was
all
for
him
i
believe
that
i
trusted
him
above
every
man
on
board
i
was
his
champion
until
i
found
he
had
been
meddling
with
my
papers
most
secret
dispatches
too
yes
i
have
proof
of
this
and
since
then
some
of
the
stolen
pages
have
found
their
way
into
our
enemies
hands
he
has
not
only
betrayed
me
but
his
country
too
and
worst
of
all
in
men
s
eyes
he
has
sinned
against
the
code
of
honor
yet
there
is
one
thing
i
will
and
must
remember
t
is
never
the
meanest
men
who
serve
their
chosen
cause
as
spies
the
pity
is
that
where
success
may
be
illustrious
the
business
asks
completest
sacrifice
and
failure
is
the
blackest
disgrace
tis
wallingford
s
reward
i
loved
him
once
and
now
i
could
stand
at
the
gallows
and
see
him
hanged
perhaps
he
would
say
that
he
acted
from
high
motives
t
is
ever
a
spy
s
excuse
but
i
trusted
him
and
he
would
have
ruined
me
i
do
not
believe
that
he
is
guilty
declared
mary
hamilton
with
perfect
calmness
though
she
had
drawn
back
in
horror
as
she
heard
the
last
words
and
saw
such
blazing
anger
in
paul
jones
s
eyes
you
must
look
elsewhere
for
your
enemy
she
insisted
for
some
other
man
whose
character
would
not
forbid
such
acts
as
these
if
roger
wallingford
has
broken
his
oath
of
allegiance
my
faith
in
character
is
done
i
have
known
him
all
my
life
and
i
can
answer
for
him
believe
me
there
is
some
mistake
her
eyes
did
not
fall
as
the
captain
held
them
straight
and
answerable
with
his
own
she
met
the
challenge
of
his
look
and
there
came
a
beautiful
glow
of
pity
and
gentleness
upon
her
face
the
captain
gave
a
long
sigh
i
am
sure
that
you
are
mistaken
she
said
again
quietly
since
he
did
not
speak
we
are
now
in
great
trouble
and
even
despair
about
wallingford
and
have
been
able
to
get
no
word
from
him
we
have
his
pardon
in
hand
it
would
make
you
wonder
if
i
told
you
how
it
came
to
us
your
lieutenant
was
left
most
cruelly
wounded
on
the
shore
at
whitehaven
and
was
like
to
die
on
the
long
journey
to
plymouth
jail
where
they
sent
him
how
he
has
lived
through
all
his
sufferings
i
do
not
know
i
have
seen
the
mill
prison
myself
they
would
not
even
let
us
speak
with
those
who
knew
him
among
our
poor
captives
the
night
before
we
reached
the
prison
he
had
escaped
there
were
some
men
shot
down
who
were
of
his
party
we
can
get
no
trace
of
him
at
all
whether
he
is
dead
on
the
great
moors
or
still
alive
and
wandering
in
distress
no
one
can
tell
this
does
not
look
as
if
he
were
a
spy
for
england
it
were
easy
to
give
himself
up
and
to
prove
such
a
simple
thing
if
only
to
be
spared
such
misery
i
am
afraid
that
his
mother
will
soon
fade
out
of
life
now
that
after
all
these
weeks
she
believes
him
dead
she
thought
he
would
return
with
us
when
she
saw
us
ride
away
to
plymouth
and
the
disappointment
was
more
than
she
could
bear
the
bitter
memory
of
that
morning
at
the
mill
prison
was
like
a
sword
in
mary
s
heart
and
she
stopped
she
had
spoken
quickly
and
was
now
trembling
from
head
to
foot
i
thought
when
i
saw
your
face
that
you
would
know
how
to
help
us
find
him
she
said
sorrowfully
under
her
breath
if
i
have
been
wrong
exclaimed
the
captain
if
i
have
been
wrong
i
should
give
my
life
to
make
amends
but
all
the
proofs
were
there
i
even
found
a
bit
of
one
of
my
own
papers
among
his
effects
t
was
in
a
book
he
had
been
reading
but
i
hid
the
matter
from
every
one
on
board
i
could
not
bear
they
should
know
it
dickson
s
word
was
their
mainstay
at
first
but
that
counted
worse
than
nothing
to
me
till
there
were
other
matters
which
fully
upheld
his
account
dickson
has
always
been
a
man
mistrusted
and
reproached
protested
miss
hamilton
with
indignation
there
is
a
man
for
you
whose
character
would
not
forbid
such
treachery
you
must
know
too
that
he
has
a
deep
hatred
for
the
wallingfords
and
would
spare
no
pains
to
revenge
himself
the
captain
stood
doubtful
and
dismayed
i
have
gone
over
this
sad
matter
by
day
and
by
night
he
said
i
do
not
see
where
i
could
be
mistaken
i
went
to
the
bottom
of
my
evidence
without
regard
to
dickson
and
i
found
proof
enough
i
hate
that
man
and
distrust
him
yet
i
can
find
little
fault
with
his
service
on
the
ship
and
when
i
have
been
surest
of
catching
him
in
a
lie
he
always
proves
to
have
told
the
exact
truth
and
wears
a
martyr
s
air
and
is
full
of
his
cursed
cant
and
talk
of
piety
alas
i
know
not
what
can
be
done
at
this
late
day
did
you
never
think
that
dickson
could
put
many
a
proof
like
your
bit
of
paper
where
your
eyes
alone
could
fall
upon
it
asked
mary
i
remember
well
that
he
has
tried
more
than
once
to
cast
blame
upon
others
when
he
himself
was
the
sinner
he
has
plenty
of
ability
t
is
his
bad
use
of
it
that
one
may
always
fear
the
captain
moved
restlessly
as
if
conscious
of
her
accusation
many
believed
wallingford
to
be
a
tory
on
the
ship
he
answered
they
were
jealous
and
suspicious
of
his
presence
but
dickson
who
has
warped
simpson
s
honest
mind
against
me
may
also
have
set
his
energies
to
this
if
we
could
only
find
wallingford
if
we
could
only
hear
his
own
story
of
that
night
in
all
this
time
he
should
have
sent
some
word
to
me
if
he
were
innocent
if
i
were
free
i
d
soon
know
what
they
learned
from
him
in
the
prison
he
must
have
spoken
openly
with
some
of
the
portsmouth
men
who
are
there
what
can
we
do
the
speaker
ended
in
a
different
tone
altogether
making
a
direct
appeal
to
mary
if
i
have
fallen
a
dupe
to
such
a
man
as
dickson
in
this
matter
i
shall
never
recover
from
the
shame
you
would
never
forgive
me
alas
how
can
i
ask
the
question
that
my
heart
prompts
you
are
most
unhappy
said
paul
jones
with
exquisite
compassion
is
it
because
of
wallingford
alone
oh
mary
is
there
no
hope
for
me
you
have
had
my
letters
you
can
not
but
remember
how
we
parted
she
looked
at
him
imploringly
tell
me
said
the
captain
i
must
ask
a
question
that
is
very
hard
for
me
i
believe
that
you
love
this
unfortunate
officer
and
desire
his
safety
beyond
everything
else
is
it
not
true
mary
waited
only
a
moment
before
she
spoke
yes
it
is
true
she
said
then
i
know
now
that
we
have
always
belonged
to
each
other
alas
for
my
own
happiness
said
the
captain
looking
at
her
i
thought
when
we
parted
that
last
night
he
groaned
his
words
faltering
oh
that
i
had
only
spoken
glory
has
been
a
jealous
mistress
to
me
and
i
dared
not
speak
i
feared
t
would
cost
me
all
her
favor
if
my
thoughts
were
all
for
you
it
seems
a
lifetime
ago
i
could
throw
my
hope
of
glory
down
at
your
feet
now
if
it
were
any
use
i
can
do
nothing
without
love
oh
mary
must
you
tell
me
that
it
is
too
late
the
captain
s
voice
made
poignant
outcry
to
the
listener
s
heart
the
air
seemed
to
quiver
in
strange
waves
and
the
walls
of
the
abbey
seemed
to
sway
unsteadily
the
strong
determined
soul
before
her
was
pleading
for
an
impossible
happiness
even
better
than
he
could
know
she
knew
that
he
lacked
a
woman
s
constant
love
and
upholding
and
that
with
all
his
noble
powers
his
life
tended
toward
ruin
and
disappointment
she
stood
there
white
and
wistful
her
compassionate
heart
was
shaken
with
pity
for
his
loneliness
there
was
a
change
on
the
man
s
dark
face
he
took
one
step
toward
her
and
then
was
conscious
of
a
strange
separation
between
them
mary
did
not
move
she
did
not
speak
she
stood
there
as
a
ghost
might
stand
by
night
to
pity
the
troubles
of
men
she
knew
with
a
woman
s
foresight
the
difference
it
would
make
if
she
could
only
stand
with
love
and
patience
by
his
side
there
must
be
some
one
to
love
you
as
it
is
in
your
heart
to
love
she
told
him
then
god
bless
you
and
give
you
such
a
happiness
you
are
sure
to
find
each
other
in
this
sad
world
i
know
you
will
i
know
you
will
one
of
the
great
bells
began
to
ring
in
the
tower
and
its
vibrations
jarred
her
strangely
she
could
hardly
hinder
herself
now
from
a
new
outburst
of
tears
and
could
not
think
clearly
any
more
and
was
trembling
with
weakness
i
must
go
home
if
i
can
she
whispered
but
her
voice
was
very
low
i
can
not
get
home
no
no
i
must
not
let
you
be
so
kind
he
placed
her
gently
on
the
stone
bench
and
she
leaned
back
heavily
with
his
arm
about
her
thankful
for
some
protecting
affection
in
her
brief
bewilderment
she
could
not
but
hear
his
pitying
endearing
words
as
her
faintness
passed
the
poor
girl
was
so
breathless
and
weak
that
she
could
only
throw
herself
upon
his
mercy
there
was
even
an
unexpected
comfort
in
his
presence
had
been
so
much
alone
with
strangers
she
forgot
everything
save
that
he
was
a
friend
of
her
happier
days
and
as
for
the
captain
he
had
held
her
in
his
arms
she
had
turned
to
him
with
touching
readiness
in
her
distress
nothing
could
ever
rob
his
heart
of
the
remembrance
he
watched
her
with
solicitude
as
her
color
came
back
and
lingered
until
he
saw
that
she
was
herself
again
they
must
part
quickly
for
he
could
not
venture
to
be
seen
with
her
in
the
open
streets
you
have
convinced
me
that
i
may
have
been
wrong
about
wallingford
he
said
impulsively
i
shall
now
do
my
best
to
aid
you
and
to
search
the
matter
out
i
shall
see
you
again
your
happiness
will
always
be
very
dear
to
me
i
can
but
thank
heaven
for
our
being
here
together
though
i
have
only
added
something
to
your
pain
perhaps
these
troubles
may
not
be
far
from
their
solution
and
i
shall
see
you
soon
in
happier
hours
he
kissed
her
hand
and
let
it
go
his
old
hope
went
with
it
there
must
be
a
quick
ending
now
a
man
must
always
resent
pity
for
himself
but
his
heart
was
full
of
most
tender
pity
for
this
overburdened
girl
there
had
been
few
moments
of
any
sort
of
weakness
in
all
the
course
of
her
long
bravery
was
sure
enough
of
that
only
loved
her
the
more
she
had
been
the
first
to
show
him
some
higher
things
it
was
not
alone
her
charm
but
her
character
her
great
power
of
affection
her
perfect
friendship
that
would
make
him
a
nobler
lover
to
his
life
s
end
she
watched
him
as
he
went
away
down
the
nave
toward
the
open
door
the
poverty
of
such
disguise
and
the
poor
sailor
s
threadbare
dress
could
not
hide
a
familiar
figure
but
he
was
alert
no
more
and
even
drooped
a
little
as
he
stood
for
one
moment
in
the
doorway
he
did
not
once
look
back
there
were
people
in
the
church
now
and
his
eyes
were
bent
upon
the
ground
then
he
lifted
his
head
with
all
the
spirit
that
belonged
to
him
stepped
out
boldly
from
the
shadow
into
the
bright
daylight
beyond
and
was
gone
the
old
verger
crossed
over
to
speak
with
mary
he
had
learned
to
know
her
by
sight
for
she
came
often
to
the
abbey
church
and
guessed
that
she
might
be
one
of
the
exiles
from
america
t
was
some
poor
sailor
begging
i
misdoubt
there
s
a
sight
o
beggars
stranded
in
the
town
i
hope
he
would
not
make
bold
to
vex
you
my
lady
asked
the
old
man
fumbling
his
snuffbox
with
trembling
hands
i
fell
asleep
in
the
chapter
room
t
was
some
one
i
had
known
at
home
miss
hamilton
answered
he
is
a
good
man
and
she
smiled
a
little
as
she
spoke
it
would
be
so
easy
to
cause
a
consternation
in
the
town
her
head
was
steady
now
but
she
still
sat
where
the
captain
left
her
t
is
a
beautiful
monyment
one
said
the
verger
pointing
up
to
the
kneeling
figures
in
their
prim
ruffs
t
is
as
beautiful
a
monyment
as
any
here
i
ve
made
bold
to
notice
how
you
often
sits
here
to
view
it
some
o
your
ameriky
folks
was
obsarvin
as
their
forbears
was
all
buried
in
this
abbey
in
ancient
times
t
would
be
sure
to
make
the
owd
place
a
bit
homely
the
bells
were
still
chiming
and
there
were
worshipers
coming
in
mary
hamilton
slipped
away
lest
she
should
meet
some
acquaintance
she
felt
herself
shaken
as
if
by
a
tempest
paul
jones
had
gone
into
fresh
danger
when
he
left
her
side
his
life
was
spent
among
risks
and
chances
she
might
have
been
gentler
to
him
and
sent
him
away
better
comforted
she
walked
slowly
and
stood
still
once
in
the
street
startled
by
the
remembrance
of
her
frank
confession
of
love
the
warm
color
rushed
to
her
pale
face
to
have
told
the
captain
when
she
had
never
told
roger
himself
or
his
mother
or
any
but
her
own
heart
yet
all
her
sorrows
were
lightened
by
these
unconsidered
words
the
whole
world
might
hear
them
now
they
were
no
secret
any
more
there
were
busy
groups
of
people
about
the
taverns
and
tobacco
shops
as
if
some
new
excitement
were
in
the
air
it
might
be
that
there
was
news
from
america
as
mary
passed
she
heard
one
man
shout
to
another
that
john
paul
jones
the
pirate
had
been
seen
the
day
before
in
bristol
itself
an
old
sailor
just
landed
from
a
long
voyage
at
sea
had
known
him
as
he
passed
there
was
word
too
that
the
ranger
had
lately
been
sighted
again
off
plymouth
and
had
taken
two
prizes
in
the
very
teeth
of
the
king
s
fleet
watcher
s
there
s
no
deep
valley
but
near
some
great
hill
late
that
night
mary
hamilton
sat
by
the
window
in
her
sleeping
closet
a
quaint
little
room
that
led
from
the
stately
chamber
of
madam
wallingford
past
midnight
it
was
still
warm
out
of
doors
and
the
air
strangely
lifeless
it
had
been
late
before
the
maid
went
away
and
their
dear
charge
had
fallen
asleep
so
weak
and
querulous
and
full
of
despair
had
she
been
all
the
long
day
the
night
taper
was
flickering
in
its
cup
of
oil
but
the
street
outside
was
brighter
than
the
great
room
the
waning
moon
was
just
rising
and
the
watcher
leaned
back
wearily
against
the
shutter
and
saw
the
opposite
roofs
slowly
growing
less
dim
there
were
tall
trees
near
by
in
the
garden
and
a
breeze
that
mary
could
not
feel
where
she
sat
was
rustling
among
the
poplar
leaves
and
mulberries
she
heard
footsteps
coming
up
the
street
and
the
sound
startled
her
as
if
she
had
been
sitting
at
her
window
at
home
where
footsteps
at
that
time
of
night
might
mean
a
messenger
to
the
house
the
great
town
of
bristol
lay
fast
asleep
it
was
only
the
watchman
s
tread
that
had
startled
the
listener
and
for
a
moment
changed
her
weary
thoughts
the
old
man
went
by
with
his
clumsy
lantern
but
gave
no
cry
nor
told
the
hour
until
he
was
well
into
the
distance
there
was
much
to
think
about
at
the
end
of
this
day
which
had
brought
an
unexpected
addition
to
her
heart
s
regret
the
remembrance
of
paul
jones
his
insistence
upon
wallingford
s
treachery
a
sad
mystery
which
now
might
never
be
solved
even
the
abruptness
of
the
captain
s
own
declaration
of
love
and
a
sense
of
unreality
that
came
from
her
own
miserable
weakness
these
things
were
new
burdens
for
the
mind
she
could
not
but
recognize
the
hero
in
this
man
of
great
distinction
as
he
had
stood
before
her
and
yet
his
melancholy
exit
with
the
very
poverty
of
his
dress
had
somehow
added
to
the
misery
of
the
moment
it
seemed
to
her
now
as
if
they
had
met
each
other
that
morning
with
no
thoughts
of
victory
but
in
the
very
moment
of
defeat
their
hopes
had
been
so
high
when
last
they
talked
together
again
there
came
to
her
mind
the
anxiety
of
that
bright
night
when
she
had
stood
pleading
with
roger
wallingford
on
the
river
shore
and
had
thrown
down
her
challenge
at
his
feet
how
easy
and
even
how
happy
it
all
seemed
beside
these
dreadful
days
how
little
she
had
known
then
how
little
she
had
loved
then
life
had
been
hardly
more
than
a
play
beside
this
it
was
more
dramatic
than
real
she
had
felt
a
remote
insincerity
in
those
old
days
in
even
the
passionate
words
of
the
two
men
and
a
strange
barrier
like
a
thin
wall
of
glass
was
always
between
her
heart
and
theirs
now
indeed
she
was
face
to
face
with
life
she
was
in
the
middle
of
the
great
battle
now
she
loved
roger
wallingford
and
her
whole
heart
was
forever
his
whether
he
was
somewhere
in
the
world
alive
or
whether
he
lay
starved
and
dead
among
the
furze
and
heather
on
the
devon
moors
she
saw
his
white
face
there
as
if
she
came
upon
it
in
the
shadows
of
her
thoughts
and
gave
a
quick
cry
such
was
the
intensity
of
her
grief
and
passion
and
the
frail
figure
stirred
under
its
coverlet
in
the
great
room
beyond
with
a
pitiful
low
moan
like
the
faint
echo
of
her
own
despair
the
sad
hour
went
by
and
still
this
tired
girl
sat
by
the
window
like
a
watcher
who
did
not
dare
to
forget
herself
in
sleep
her
past
life
had
never
been
so
clearly
spread
before
her
and
all
the
pleasant
old
days
were
but
a
background
for
one
straight
figure
the
manly
boy
whom
she
played
with
and
rebuffed
on
equal
terms
the
and
boyish
man
whom
she
had
begun
to
fear
a
little
and
then
to
tease
lest
she
should
admire
too
much
she
remembered
all
his
beautiful
reticence
and
growing
seriousness
the
piety
with
which
he
served
his
widowed
mother
the
pleading
voice
that
last
night
of
all
when
she
had
been
so
slow
to
answer
to
his
love
it
was
she
herself
now
who
could
plead
and
who
must
have
patience
how
hard
she
had
been
sometimes
how
deaf
and
blind
how
resistant
and
dull
of
heart
t
was
a
girl
s
strange
instinct
to
fly
to
hide
to
so
defeat
at
first
the
dear
pursuer
of
her
heart
s
love
again
there
was
a
footstep
in
the
street
it
was
not
the
old
watchman
coming
for
presently
she
heard
a
man
s
voice
singing
a
country
tune
that
she
had
known
at
home
he
came
within
sight
and
crossed
the
street
and
stood
over
the
way
waiting
in
shadow
now
he
went
on
softly
with
the
song
it
was
an
old
portsmouth
ballad
that
all
the
river
knew
the
very
sound
of
it
was
like
a
message
the
mermaids
they
beneath
the
wave
the
mermaids
they
o
er
my
sailor
s
grave
the
mermaids
they
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
are
weeping
their
salt
tears
for
me
the
morning
star
was
shining
still
t
was
daybreak
over
the
eastern
hill
he
began
the
song
again
but
still
more
softly
and
then
stopped
mary
kept
silence
her
heart
began
to
beat
very
fast
she
put
her
hand
on
the
broad
where
the
moonlight
lay
and
the
singer
saw
it
and
came
out
into
the
street
she
saw
the
spanish
sailor
again
what
had
brought
the
captain
to
find
her
at
this
time
of
night
she
leaned
out
quickly
i
am
here
can
i
help
you
is
there
any
news
she
whispered
as
he
stood
close
under
the
window
looking
up
you
are
putting
yourself
in
danger
she
warned
him
anxiously
i
heard
the
people
saying
that
you
have
been
seen
in
bristol
this
morning
as
i
came
home
god
be
thanked
that
i
have
found
you
awake
he
answered
eagerly
and
the
moon
shone
full
upon
his
face
so
that
she
could
see
it
plain
i
feared
that
i
should
have
to
wait
till
daylight
to
see
you
i
knew
no
one
to
trust
with
my
message
and
i
must
run
for
open
sea
i
have
learned
something
of
our
mystery
at
last
go
you
to
the
inn
at
old
passage
night
you
hear
me
the
inn
at
old
passage
and
wait
there
till
i
come
go
at
nightfall
and
let
yourself
be
unknown
in
the
house
if
you
can
i
think
we
may
have
news
from
wallingford
she
gave
a
little
cry
and
leaned
far
out
of
the
window
speaking
quickly
in
her
excitement
and
begging
to
hear
more
but
the
captain
had
vanished
to
the
shadows
whence
he
came
her
heart
was
beating
so
fast
and
hard
now
that
she
could
not
hear
his
light
footsteps
as
he
hurried
away
running
back
to
the
down
the
echoing
paved
street
offered
neither
man
nor
soldier
what
ignorant
and
mad
malicious
traitors
license
they
mean
when
they
cry
liberty
the
roscoff
fishing
smack
lay
in
the
severn
above
avon
mouth
and
it
was
broad
day
when
captain
paul
jones
came
aboard
again
having
been
rowed
down
the
river
by
some
young
breton
sailors
whom
he
had
found
asleep
in
the
bottom
of
their
boat
there
would
be
natural
suspicion
of
a
humble
french
craft
like
theirs
but
when
they
had
been
overhauled
in
those
waters
a
day
or
two
before
the
owner
of
the
little
vessel
a
sedate
person
by
the
name
of
dickson
professed
himself
to
be
an
englishman
from
the
island
of
guernsey
with
proper
sailing
papers
and
due
reverence
for
king
george
the
third
his
crew
being
foreigners
could
answer
no
decent
bristol
questions
and
they
were
allowed
to
top
their
boom
for
the
fishing
grounds
unmolested
having
only
put
into
harbor
for
supplies
the
roscoff
lads
looked
at
their
true
captain
with
mingled
sleepiness
and
admiration
as
he
took
the
steersman
s
place
he
presently
opened
a
large
knotted
bundle
handkerchief
and
gave
them
a
share
of
the
rich
treat
of
tobacco
and
early
apples
within
then
seeing
that
they
kept
their
right
course
he
made
a
pillow
of
his
arm
and
fell
sound
asleep
as
they
came
under
the
vessel
s
side
the
barking
of
a
little
dog
on
board
waked
him
again
with
a
start
he
looked
weary
enough
as
he
stood
to
give
his
orders
and
watch
his
opportunity
to
leap
from
the
boat
as
they
bobbed
about
in
the
choppy
sea
all
was
quiet
on
deck
in
the
bright
sunlight
only
the
little
french
dog
kept
an
anxious
lookout
the
captain
gave
orders
to
break
out
their
anchor
and
be
off
down
channel
and
then
turned
toward
the
cabin
just
as
dickson
made
his
appearance
yawning
in
the
low
companion
way
dickson
had
found
such
life
as
this
on
the
fisherman
very
dull
besides
having
a
solid
resentment
of
its
enforced
privations
none
of
the
crew
could
speak
english
save
cooper
and
hanscom
who
had
come
to
hate
him
and
would
not
speak
to
him
at
all
except
in
the
exercise
of
duty
he
knew
nothing
of
the
breton
talk
and
was
a
man
very
fond
of
idle
and
argumentative
conversation
the
captain
had
been
ashore
now
for
long
hours
and
his
offended
colleague
stood
back
with
a
look
of
surly
discontent
and
no
words
of
welcome
to
let
the
tyrant
pass
the
captain
took
a
letter
out
of
his
pocket
and
gave
it
to
him
with
a
quick
but
not
unfriendly
glance
as
if
half
amused
by
dickson
s
own
expression
of
alarm
as
he
turned
the
folded
paper
and
looked
at
its
unbroken
seal
he
mumbled
something
about
a
tailor
s
bill
and
then
insisted
that
the
letter
could
not
be
meant
for
him
he
did
not
seem
to
know
what
it
would
be
safe
to
say
come
below
i
wish
to
speak
with
you
the
captain
spoke
impatiently
as
usual
and
had
the
air
of
a
kingbird
which
dealt
with
a
helpless
crow
we
are
in
no
danger
of
being
overheard
i
must
speak
with
you
before
you
read
your
letter
i
have
chanced
upon
some
important
information
i
have
a
new
plan
on
foot
certainly
sir
replied
dickson
looking
very
but
putting
a
most
complaisant
alacrity
into
his
voice
the
news
was
given
me
by
a
man
who
succeeded
in
making
his
escape
from
the
mill
prison
some
months
since
and
who
came
to
bristol
where
he
had
old
acquaintances
he
is
now
at
work
in
a
coppersmith
s
shop
explained
the
captain
he
has
been
able
to
help
some
of
his
shipmates
since
then
and
under
the
assumed
character
of
an
american
loyalist
has
enjoyed
the
confidence
of
both
parties
t
will
be
a
dangerous
fellow
to
tamper
with
i
have
heard
something
of
him
before
i
doubt
if
he
is
very
honest
but
he
turns
many
a
good
sound
penny
for
himself
lee
believes
that
all
his
spies
are
as
trusty
as
ford
and
thornton
but
i
can
tell
you
that
they
are
not
the
captain
s
temper
appeared
to
be
rising
and
dickson
winced
a
little
i
know
of
some
things
that
go
on
unbeknownst
to
him
and
so
perhaps
do
you
dickson
this
man
has
advised
me
of
some
matters
in
bristol
this
very
night
about
which
i
own
myself
to
be
curious
he
says
that
there
are
two
men
out
of
the
mill
prison
who
may
be
expected
in
and
are
hoping
to
get
safe
away
to
sea
it
would
be
a
pretty
thing
to
add
a
pair
of
good
american
sailors
to
our
number
without
the
trouble
of
formal
exchange
so
i
must
again
delay
our
sailing
for
france
and
i
shall
leave
you
here
while
i
go
to
inspect
the
fugitives
there
are
special
reasons
too
why
i
wish
to
get
news
from
the
prison
the
captain
seemed
excited
and
spoke
with
unusual
frankness
and
civility
though
dickson
had
begun
to
listen
with
uneasiness
he
now
expressed
approval
of
such
a
plan
but
ventured
at
the
same
time
to
give
an
officious
warning
that
there
might
be
danger
of
a
plot
among
the
bristol
loyalists
they
would
make
themselves
very
happy
by
securing
such
an
enemy
as
john
paul
jones
but
this
proof
of
sagacity
and
unselfishness
on
dickson
s
part
the
captain
did
not
deign
to
notice
i
shall
pass
the
day
in
fishing
and
toward
night
take
another
anchorage
farther
up
the
channel
he
continued
there
are
reasons
why
prudence
forbids
my
going
into
the
avon
again
by
boat
or
being
seen
by
day
about
the
bristol
quays
i
shall
run
farther
up
the
severn
and
land
there
and
ride
across
by
westbury
and
over
the
downs
into
bristol
and
so
return
by
daybreak
i
have
bespoken
a
horse
to
wait
for
me
and
you
will
see
that
a
boat
is
ready
to
take
me
off
in
the
morning
dickson
received
these
instructions
with
apparent
interest
and
an
unconscious
sigh
of
relief
he
understood
that
the
captain
s
mind
was
deeply
concerned
in
so
innocent
a
matter
there
was
probably
no
reason
for
apprehension
on
his
own
part
the
next
moment
his
spirits
fell
and
his
face
took
on
that
evil
color
which
was
the
one
sign
of
emotion
and
animosity
that
he
was
unable
to
conceal
there
was
likely
to
be
direct
news
now
from
the
mill
prison
and
the
grievous
nightmare
that
haunted
dickson
s
thoughts
was
the
possible
reappearance
of
roger
wallingford
once
or
twice
he
swallowed
hard
and
tried
to
gather
courage
to
speak
but
the
words
would
not
come
the
captain
passed
him
with
a
scowl
and
threw
himself
into
the
wretched
bunk
of
the
cabin
to
get
some
sleep
captain
jones
and
dickson
boldly
followed
him
i
have
something
important
which
i
must
say
will
not
you
read
your
letter
first
inquired
the
captain
with
unaccustomed
politeness
i
am
very
much
fatigued
as
you
might
see
i
want
a
little
sleep
after
these
two
nights
we
are
alone
now
sir
and
there
is
something
that
has
lain
very
heavy
on
my
mind
the
man
was
fluent
enough
once
his
voice
had
found
utterance
the
captain
with
neither
an
oath
nor
a
growl
sat
up
in
his
berth
and
listened
with
some
successful
mockery
of
respect
looking
him
straight
in
the
face
that
night
remember
sir
at
whitehaven
i
have
come
to
be
troubled
about
that
night
you
may
not
recall
the
fact
that
so
unimportant
a
person
as
i
stood
in
any
real
danger
on
such
an
occasion
of
glory
to
you
but
i
was
set
upon
by
the
town
guard
and
only
escaped
with
my
life
i
returned
to
the
ranger
in
a
suffering
condition
you
were
a
little
overset
by
your
disappointment
and
by
wallingford
s
disappearance
and
your
suspicions
of
his
course
but
in
my
encounter
know
that
it
was
not
yet
day
in
the
excitement
of
escaping
from
an
armed
guard
i
fear
that
i
fought
hand
to
hand
with
wallingford
himself
taking
him
for
a
constable
he
was
the
last
of
them
to
attack
me
when
i
was
unable
to
discriminate
he
either
added
dickson
slyly
but
with
a
look
of
great
concern
the
thought
has
struck
me
that
he
might
not
have
been
disloyal
to
our
cause
and
was
perhaps
escaping
to
the
boat
as
i
was
when
we
fell
into
such
desperate
combat
in
that
dark
lane
it
would
put
me
into
an
awful
position
you
can
see
sir
i
may
be
possessed
of
too
great
a
share
of
human
frailty
but
i
have
had
more
than
my
share
of
ill
fortune
i
have
suffered
from
unjust
suspicions
too
but
this
dreadful
accident
would
place
me
you
thought
to
save
your
life
from
an
unknown
enemy
the
captain
interrupted
him
you
struck
one
of
your
own
party
by
mischance
in
the
dark
he
suggested
without
any
apparent
reproach
in
his
voice
exactly
so
sir
said
dickson
taking
heart
but
looking
very
mournful
yet
you
told
us
that
wallingford
alarmed
the
guard
i
could
suspect
nothing
else
sir
at
the
time
you
heard
my
reasons
when
i
returned
never
mind
your
return
urged
paul
jones
still
without
any
tone
of
accusation
t
was
long
after
the
gray
of
the
morning
it
was
almost
broad
day
when
i
left
the
shore
myself
at
whitehaven
and
a
man
might
easily
know
one
of
his
shipmates
t
was
a
dark
lane
you
told
me
however
and
his
eyes
twinkled
with
the
very
least
new
brightness
if
we
should
ever
see
poor
wallingford
again
you
could
settle
all
that
between
you
i
can
well
understand
your
present
concern
do
you
think
that
you
did
the
lieutenant
any
serious
damage
before
you
escaped
i
recall
the
fact
that
you
were
badly
mauled
about
the
countenance
i
fear
that
i
struck
him
worst
in
the
shoulder
sir
and
dickson
shifted
his
position
uneasily
and
put
one
hand
to
the
deck
timber
above
to
hold
himself
steady
now
that
they
were
rolling
badly
with
the
anchor
off
ground
i
know
that
i
had
my
knife
in
my
hand
he
is
a
very
strong
fellow
and
a
terrible
man
to
wrestle
with
mean
the
man
whom
i
struck
who
may
have
been
wallingford
i
thought
he
would
kill
me
first
i
wish
you
had
bethought
yourself
to
speak
sooner
said
the
captain
patiently
t
is
a
thing
for
us
to
reflect
upon
deeply
but
i
can
hear
no
more
now
i
must
sleep
as
you
see
before
i
am
fit
for
anything
do
not
let
the
men
disturb
me
they
may
get
down
channel
to
their
fishing
if
they
succeed
as
well
as
yesterday
we
shall
soon
make
the
cost
of
this
little
adventure
he
spoke
drowsily
and
drew
the
rough
blanket
over
his
head
to
keep
the
light
away
dickson
mounted
to
the
deck
if
he
had
known
how
easy
it
would
be
to
make
things
straight
with
the
captain
how
much
suffering
he
might
have
spared
himself
you
must
take
him
in
the
right
mood
too
but
the
captain
had
an
eye
like
a
gimlet
that
twisted
into
a
man
s
head
wallingford
may
never
turn
up
after
all
i
wish
i
had
killed
him
while
i
was
about
it
said
dickson
to
himself
uneasily
it
may
be
all
a
lie
that
he
was
sent
to
plymouth
it
would
be
such
a
distance
there
was
something
the
matter
with
this
world
to
have
an
eye
like
paul
jones
s
fixed
upon
you
while
you
were
trying
to
make
a
straight
story
was
anything
but
an
assistance
or
a
pleasure
the
captain
was
shaking
with
laughter
in
the
cabin
as
dickson
disappeared
what
a
face
he
put
on
the
hypocrite
his
race
is
run
he
told
me
more
than
he
needed
and
paul
jones
s
face
grew
stern
as
he
lay
there
looking
at
the
planks
above
his
head
he
s
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
now
if
he
only
knew
it
when
a
man
s
character
is
gone
his
reputation
is
sure
enough
to
follow
and
with
this
sage
reflection
the
captain
covered
his
head
again
carefully
and
went
to
sleep
unaware
of
this
final
verdict
dickson
was
comfortably
reading
his
letter
on
the
deck
and
feeling
certain
that
fortune
had
turned
his
way
his
mind
had
been
made
up
some
days
before
to
leave
the
ranger
as
soon
as
he
got
back
to
france
even
if
he
must
feign
illness
to
gain
his
discharge
or
desert
the
ship
as
others
had
done
he
had
already
a
good
sum
of
money
that
had
been
paid
him
for
information
useful
to
the
british
government
and
to
avoid
future
trouble
proposed
to
hide
himself
in
the
far
south
or
in
one
of
the
west
indian
islands
my
poor
wife
would
gain
by
the
change
of
climate
said
the
scoundrel
pitying
himself
now
for
the
loss
of
friendship
and
respect
from
which
he
felt
himself
begin
to
suffer
and
for
those
very
conditions
which
he
had
so
carefully
evolved
he
started
as
he
read
the
brief
page
before
him
the
news
of
the
letter
was
amazingly
welcome
it
was
written
by
some
one
who
knew
his
most
intimate
affairs
the
chance
had
come
to
give
up
the
last
and
best
of
those
papers
which
he
had
stolen
from
the
captain
s
desk
for
this
treasure
he
had
asked
a
great
price
great
that
thornton
would
not
pay
it
at
brest
and
ford
s
messenger
had
laughed
him
in
the
face
now
there
was
the
promise
of
the
money
the
whole
noble
sum
word
of
his
being
with
paul
jones
had
somehow
reached
bristol
the
crafty
captain
had
been
unwise
for
once
in
speaking
with
this
coppersmith
and
the
play
was
up
the
writer
of
the
letter
said
that
a
safe
agent
would
meet
dickson
any
night
that
week
at
seven
o
clock
at
the
inn
by
old
passage
to
pay
him
his
own
price
for
certain
papers
or
information
there
was
added
a
handsome
offer
for
the
body
of
paul
jones
alive
or
dead
in
case
he
should
not
be
in
custody
before
that
time
the
letter
was
sealed
as
other
letters
had
been
with
a
device
known
among
thornton
s
errand
runners
old
passage
repeated
the
happy
dickson
i
must
now
find
where
that
place
is
but
they
evidently
know
my
present
situation
and
the
inn
is
no
doubt
near
he
stepped
softly
to
the
cabin
hatchway
and
looked
down
the
captain
s
face
was
turned
aside
and
he
breathed
heavily
the
chart
of
that
coast
was
within
easy
reach
dickson
took
it
from
the
chest
where
it
lay
since
it
was
an
innocent
thing
to
have
in
hand
there
was
all
the
shore
of
the
severn
and
the
bristol
channel
with
the
spot
already
marked
nearest
westbury
church
where
the
captain
was
likely
to
land
and
here
beyond
at
no
great
distance
was
old
passage
where
a
ferry
crossed
the
severn
he
should
have
more
than
time
enough
for
his
own
errand
and
a
good
evening
ashore
while
paul
jones
was
riding
into
bristol
perhaps
to
stay
there
against
his
will
for
the
slight
trouble
of
ripping
a
few
stitches
in
his
waistcoat
seams
and
taking
out
a
slip
of
paper
dickson
would
be
rich
enough
at
that
day
s
end
yes
i
ll
go
to
the
southward
when
i
reach
america
and
start
anew
he
reflected
i
ve
had
it
very
hard
but
now
i
can
take
my
ease
this
with
the
rest
of
my
savings
will
make
me
snug
he
heard
the
captain
move
and
the
planks
of
the
berth
creak
in
the
stuffy
cabin
they
were
running
free
before
the
east
wind
and
were
almost
at
the
fishing
grounds
passage
the
runlet
of
brandy
was
a
loving
runlet
and
floated
after
us
out
of
pure
pity
just
before
nightfall
that
same
day
two
men
came
riding
along
a
country
road
toward
old
passage
the
ancient
where
travelers
from
the
south
and
west
of
england
might
cross
over
into
wales
from
an
immemorial
stream
of
travel
and
the
wear
of
weather
the
was
worn
like
a
swift
stream
s
channel
deep
below
the
level
of
the
country
one
of
the
riders
kept
glancing
timidly
at
the
bushy
banks
above
his
head
as
if
he
feared
to
see
a
soldier
in
the
thicket
peering
down
his
companion
sat
straight
in
his
saddle
and
took
no
notice
of
anything
but
his
horse
and
the
slippery
road
it
had
been
showery
all
the
afternoon
and
they
were
both
spattered
with
mud
from
cap
to
stirrup
as
they
came
northward
side
by
side
to
the
top
of
a
little
hill
the
anxious
rider
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
and
his
horse
which
limped
badly
and
bore
the
marks
of
having
been
on
his
knees
whinnied
as
if
in
sympathy
the
wide
gray
waters
of
the
severn
were
spread
to
east
and
west
the
headland
before
them
fell
off
like
a
cliff
below
to
the
westward
the
land
was
edged
by
a
long
line
of
dike
which
walled
the
sea
floods
away
from
some
low
meadows
that
stretched
far
along
the
coast
over
the
water
were
drifting
low
clouds
of
fog
and
rain
but
there
was
a
dull
gleam
of
red
on
the
western
sky
like
a
winter
sunset
and
the
wind
was
blowing
at
the
road
s
end
just
before
them
was
a
group
of
gray
stone
buildings
perched
on
the
high
headland
above
the
severn
like
a
monastery
or
place
of
military
defense
as
the
travelers
rode
up
to
the
passage
inn
the
inn
yard
with
all
its
stables
and
outhouses
looked
deserted
the
sunset
gust
struck
a
last
whip
of
rain
at
the
tired
men
the
taller
of
the
two
called
impatiently
for
a
hostler
before
he
got
stiffly
to
the
ground
and
stamped
his
feet
as
he
stood
by
his
horse
it
was
a
poor
tired
country
nag
with
a
kind
eye
that
began
to
seek
some
fondling
from
her
rider
as
if
she
harbored
no
ill
will
in
spite
of
hardships
the
young
man
patted
and
stroked
the
poor
creature
which
presently
dropped
her
head
low
and
steamed
as
if
it
were
winter
weather
high
into
the
cool
air
the
small
kitchen
windows
were
dimly
lighted
there
was
a
fire
burning
within
but
the
whole
place
looked
unfriendly
with
its
dark
stone
walls
and
heavily
slated
roof
the
waters
below
were
almost
empty
of
shipping
as
if
there
were
a
storm
coming
but
as
the
rider
looked
he
saw
a
small
craft
creeping
up
close
by
the
shore
she
was
like
a
french
fishing
boat
and
had
her
sweeps
out
the
wind
was
dead
against
her
out
of
the
east
and
her
evident
effort
added
to
the
desolateness
of
the
whole
scene
the
impatient
traveler
shouted
again
with
a
strong
honest
voice
that
prevailed
against
both
wind
and
weather
so
that
one
of
the
stable
doors
was
flung
open
and
a
man
came
out
far
inside
the
dark
place
glowed
an
early
lantern
and
the
horses
turned
their
heads
that
way
eager
for
supper
and
warm
bedding
there
seemed
to
be
plenty
of
room
within
there
was
no
sound
of
stamping
hoofs
or
a
squeal
from
crowded
horses
that
nipped
their
fellows
to
get
more
comfort
for
themselves
business
was
evidently
at
a
low
ebb
rub
them
down
as
if
they
were
the
best
racers
in
england
give
them
the
best
feed
you
dare
as
soon
as
they
cool
oats
and
scant
hay
and
a
handful
of
corn
they
have
served
us
well
said
wallingford
with
great
earnestness
i
shall
look
to
them
myself
in
an
hour
or
two
and
you
shall
have
your
own
pay
the
roan
s
knees
need
to
be
come
hammet
will
you
not
alight
he
urged
his
comrade
who
through
weariness
or
uncertainty
still
sat
with
drooping
head
and
shoulders
on
his
poor
horse
shake
the
mud
off
you
here
i
ll
help
you
then
if
your
wound
hurts
again
as
the
man
gave
a
groan
in
trying
to
dismount
after
the
first
wrench
t
is
easy
enough
come
you
ll
be
none
the
worse
for
your
cropper
into
soft
clay
he
laughed
cheerfully
as
they
crossed
the
yard
toward
a
door
to
which
the
hostler
pointed
them
the
mistress
of
the
inn
a
almost
pretty
woman
suddenly
flung
her
door
open
and
came
out
on
the
step
to
bid
them
in
a
civil
tone
and
in
the
same
breath
as
she
recognized
their
forlorn
appearance
to
bid
them
begone
her
house
was
like
to
be
full
that
night
of
gentlefolk
and
others
who
had
already
bespoken
lodging
and
she
had
ceased
to
take
in
common
wayfarers
since
trade
was
so
meagre
in
these
hard
times
and
she
had
been
set
upon
by
soldiers
and
fined
for
harboring
a
pack
of
rascals
who
had
landed
their
run
goods
from
france
and
housed
them
unbeknownst
in
her
hay
barn
they
could
see
for
themselves
that
she
had
taken
down
the
tavern
sign
and
was
no
more
bound
to
entertain
them
than
any
other
decent
widow
woman
would
be
along
the
road
she
railed
away
uncontradicted
but
there
was
a
pleasant
smile
on
wallingford
s
handsome
face
that
seemed
to
increase
rather
than
diminish
at
her
flow
of
words
until
at
last
she
smiled
in
return
though
half
against
her
will
the
poor
fellow
looked
pale
and
tired
he
was
some
gentleman
in
distress
she
had
seen
his
like
before
we
must
trouble
you
for
supper
and
a
fire
he
said
to
the
landlady
i
want
some
brandy
at
once
for
my
comrade
and
while
you
get
supper
we
can
take
some
sleep
we
have
been
riding
all
day
there
will
be
a
gentleman
to
meet
me
here
by
and
by
out
of
bristol
and
he
took
advantage
of
her
stepping
aside
a
little
to
bow
politely
to
her
and
make
her
precede
him
into
the
kitchen
there
was
a
quiet
authority
in
his
behavior
which
could
not
but
be
admired
the
good
woman
took
notice
that
the
face
of
her
guest
was
white
with
fatigue
and
even
a
little
tremulous
in
spite
of
his
calmness
if
he
s
a
hunted
man
i
ll
hide
him
safe
she
now
said
to
herself
it
was
not
the
habit
of
old
passage
inn
to
ask
curious
questions
of
its
guests
or
why
they
sometimes
came
at
evening
and
kept
watch
for
boats
that
ran
in
from
and
took
them
off
by
night
this
looked
like
a
gentleman
indeed
who
would
be
as
likely
to
leave
two
gold
pieces
on
the
table
as
one
i
have
supper
to
get
for
a
couple
o
thieves
by
t
looks
of
em
that
was
here
last
night
waiting
for
some
one
who
did
n
t
come
noisy
lot
too
they
ll
get
warning
to
go
elsewhere
she
said
in
a
loud
tone
i
shall
serve
them
first
and
bid
them
begone
and
i
expect
some
gentlefolk
too
there
s
a
fire
lit
for
em
now
in
my
best
room
it
was
damp
there
and
they
d
ill
mix
with
t
rest
t
is
old
alderman
davis
out
o
bristol
one
o
their
great
merchants
and
like
to
be
their
next
lord
mayor
so
folks
says
he
s
not
been
this
way
before
these
three
years
she
said
with
importance
let
me
know
when
he
comes
cried
wallingford
eagerly
as
he
stood
by
the
fireplace
there
was
a
flush
of
color
in
his
cheeks
now
and
he
turned
to
his
companion
who
had
sunk
into
a
corner
of
the
settle
thank
god
hammet
he
exclaimed
we
re
safe
the
end
of
all
our
troubles
has
come
at
last
the
innkeeper
saw
that
he
was
much
moved
something
about
him
had
quickly
touched
her
sympathy
she
could
not
have
told
why
she
shared
his
evident
gratitude
or
why
the
inn
should
be
his
place
of
refuge
but
if
he
were
waiting
for
davis
there
was
no
fault
to
find
you
ll
sleep
a
good
pair
of
hours
without
knowing
it
the
two
of
you
she
grumbled
throw
off
your
muddy
gear
there
and
be
off
out
o
my
way
now
an
i
ll
do
the
best
i
can
take
the
chamber
at
the
stairhead
there
s
a
couple
o
beds
i
ve
two
suppers
to
get
before
the
tide
turns
to
the
ebb
the
packet
folks
ll
soon
be
coming
an
those
fellows
that
wait
for
their
mate
that
s
on
a
fishing
smack
may
want
help
with
em
if
they
re
s
bad
s
they
look
yes
i
ll
call
ye
sir
if
davis
comes
but
he
may
be
kept
the
weather
is
so
bad
hammet
had
drunk
the
brandy
thirstily
and
was
already
cowering
as
if
with
an
ague
over
the
fire
wallingford
spoke
to
him
twice
before
he
moved
the
landlady
watched
them
curiously
from
the
as
they
went
up
to
see
that
they
found
the
right
room
t
is
one
o
the
nights
when
every
strayaway
in
england
is
like
to
come
clacking
at
my
door
she
said
not
without
satisfaction
as
she
made
a
desperate
onset
at
her
long
evening
s
work
a
pair
o
runaways
she
muttered
again
but
the
tall
lad
can
t
help
princeing
it
in
his
drover
s
clothes
i
ll
tell
the
stable
to
deny
they
re
here
if
any
troopers
come
i
ll
help
em
safe
off
the
land
or
into
bristol
whether
alderman
davis
risks
his
old
bones
by
night
or
not
a
little
more
mercy
in
this
world
ain
t
goin
to
hurt
it
follow
the
there
s
not
a
fibre
in
my
trembling
frame
that
does
not
vibrate
when
thy
step
draws
near
early
in
the
morning
of
that
day
when
john
davis
had
been
returning
from
a
brief
visit
to
his
he
was
surprised
at
being
run
against
by
a
disreputable
looking
fellow
who
dashed
out
of
a
dirty
alley
and
disappeared
again
as
quickly
after
putting
a
letter
into
his
hand
the
alderman
turned
irate
to
look
after
this
lawless
person
and
then
marched
on
with
offended
dignity
up
the
hill
when
he
had
turned
a
safe
corner
he
stopped
and
holding
his
stout
cane
under
his
arm
proceeded
to
unfold
the
paper
he
had
received
threats
before
in
this
fashion
like
all
magistrates
or
town
officials
some
loose
fellow
warned
off
or
a
smuggler
heavily
fined
would
now
and
then
make
threats
against
the
authorities
the
letter
in
his
hand
proved
to
be
of
another
sort
it
might
be
dingy
without
but
within
the
handwriting
was
that
of
a
gentleman
dear
sir
he
read
slowly
my
father
s
old
friend
and
mine
ask
your
kind
assistance
in
a
time
of
great
danger
and
even
distress
i
shall
not
venture
to
bristol
before
i
have
your
permission
i
am
late
from
prison
where
i
was
taken
from
an
american
frigate
at
last
i
have
found
a
chance
to
get
to
chippenham
market
as
a
drover
and
i
hope
to
reach
old
passage
inn
where
i
was
once
in
your
company
early
in
the
night
on
friday
could
you
come
or
send
to
meet
me
there
if
it
is
safe
i
know
or
guess
your
own
principles
but
for
the
sake
of
the
past
i
think
you
will
give
what
aid
he
needs
to
roger
of
piscataqua
in
new
england
your
dear
lady
my
kinswoman
will
not
forget
the
boy
to
whom
she
was
ever
kind
nor
will
you
dear
sir
i
believe
i
can
tell
you
everything
if
we
may
meet
what
i
most
desire
is
to
get
to
france
where
i
may
join
my
ship
this
goes
by
a
safe
hand
the
reader
struck
his
cane
to
the
sidewalk
and
laughed
aloud
what
will
little
missy
say
to
this
he
said
as
he
marched
off
i
ll
hurry
on
to
carry
her
the
news
miss
hamilton
ran
out
to
meet
the
smiling
old
man
as
she
saw
him
coming
toward
the
house
and
was
full
of
pretty
friendliness
before
he
could
speak
you
were
away
before
i
was
awake
she
said
and
i
have
been
watching
for
you
this
half
hour
past
sir
first
you
must
know
that
dear
madam
wallingford
is
better
than
for
many
days
and
has
been
asking
for
you
to
visit
her
if
it
please
you
and
i
have
a
new
plan
for
us
some
one
has
sent
me
word
that
there
may
be
news
out
of
the
mill
prison
if
we
can
be
at
the
inn
at
passage
i
hope
you
will
not
say
it
is
too
far
to
ride
she
pleaded
you
have
often
shown
me
the
place
when
we
rode
beyond
clifton
davis
s
news
was
old
already
his
face
fell
with
disappointment
it
was
a
poor
sailor
who
brought
me
word
she
continued
speaking
more
slowly
and
watching
him
with
anxiety
perhaps
we
shall
hear
from
roger
he
may
have
been
retaken
and
some
one
brings
us
word
from
him
who
has
luckily
escaped
the
old
merchant
looked
at
mary
shrewdly
you
had
no
message
from
wallingford
himself
he
asked
oh
no
said
the
girl
wistfully
that
were
to
put
a
happy
end
to
everything
but
i
do
think
that
we
may
have
news
of
him
if
you
had
not
come
i
should
have
gone
to
find
you
i
was
so
impatient
davis
seated
himself
in
his
chair
and
took
on
the
air
of
a
magistrate
now
that
they
were
in
the
house
after
all
roger
wallingford
could
know
nothing
of
his
mother
or
miss
hamilton
or
of
their
being
in
england
there
was
no
hint
of
them
in
the
note
i
suppose
that
we
can
make
shift
to
ride
to
passage
he
said
soberly
it
is
not
so
far
as
many
a
day
s
ride
that
you
and
i
have
taken
this
year
but
i
think
we
may
have
rain
again
from
the
look
of
the
clouds
and
i
am
always
in
danger
of
the
gout
in
this
late
summer
weather
perhaps
it
will
be
only
another
chase
he
added
gruffly
but
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
if
i
could
tell
you
who
brought
the
news
said
mary
impulsively
no
i
must
not
risk
his
name
even
with
you
dear
friend
but
indeed
i
have
great
hope
and
madam
is
strangely
better
somehow
my
heart
is
very
light
the
old
man
looked
up
with
a
smile
as
mary
stood
before
him
he
had
grown
very
fond
of
the
child
and
loved
to
see
that
the
drawn
look
of
pain
and
patience
was
gone
now
from
her
face
i
wish
that
it
were
night
already
when
can
we
start
she
asked
friday
is
no
lucky
day
insisted
john
davis
but
we
must
do
what
we
can
so
madam
s
heart
is
light
too
well
all
this
may
mean
something
he
said
indulgently
i
must
first
see
some
of
our
town
council
who
are
coming
to
discuss
important
matters
with
me
at
a
stated
hour
this
afternoon
and
then
we
can
ride
away
we
have
searched
many
an
inn
together
and
every
village
knows
us
this
west
side
of
dorset
but
i
believe
we
have
never
tried
old
passage
before
put
on
your
thick
riding
gown
with
the
little
capes
i
look
for
both
rain
and
chill
the
weather
looked
dark
and
showery
in
the
east
the
clouds
were
gathering
fast
there
and
in
the
north
though
the
sun
still
fell
on
the
long
stretch
of
dundry
it
had
been
a
bright
day
for
bristol
but
now
a
dark
wet
night
was
coming
on
the
towers
of
the
abbey
church
and
mary
radcliffe
stood
like
gray
rocks
in
a
lake
of
fog
and
if
he
had
been
on
any
other
errand
the
alderman
would
have
turned
their
horses
on
the
height
of
clifton
and
gone
back
to
his
comfortable
home
the
pretty
chimes
in
the
old
church
at
westbury
called
after
them
the
news
that
it
was
five
o
clock
as
they
cantered
and
trotted
on
almost
to
the
borders
of
the
severn
itself
only
to
be
stopped
and
driven
to
shelter
by
a
heavy
fall
of
rain
they
were
already
belated
and
davis
displeased
himself
with
the
thought
that
they
were
in
for
a
night
s
absence
and
in
no
very
luxurious
quarters
he
had
counted
upon
the
waning
moon
to
get
them
back
however
late
to
bristol
but
the
roads
were
more
and
more
heavy
as
they
rode
on
at
last
they
found
themselves
close
to
the
and
made
their
two
horses
scramble
up
the
high
dike
that
bordered
it
and
so
got
a
shorter
way
to
passage
and
a
drier
one
than
the
highway
they
had
left
the
great
dike
was
like
one
of
the
dikes
of
holland
with
rich
meadow
farms
behind
it
which
the
high
tides
and
spring
floods
had
often
drowned
and
spoiled
in
ancient
days
the
severn
looked
gray
and
sullen
as
they
rode
along
beside
it
there
were
but
two
or
three
poor
fishing
craft
running
in
from
sea
and
a
very
dim
gray
outline
of
the
welsh
hills
beyond
there
was
no
comfortable
little
haven
anywhere
in
view
in
this
great
landscape
and
sea
border
no
sign
of
a
town
or
even
a
fishing
hamlet
near
the
shore
only
the
long
curving
line
of
the
dike
itself
and
miles
away
like
a
forsaken
citadel
the
passage
inn
stood
high
and
lonely
the
wind
grew
colder
as
they
rode
and
they
rode
in
silence
each
lamenting
the
other
s
discomfort
but
clinging
to
the
warm
unquenchable
hope
of
happiness
that
comforted
their
hearts
there
were
two
or
three
cottages
of
the
dikekeepers
wedged
against
the
inner
side
of
the
embankment
each
with
a
little
gable
window
that
looked
seaward
one
might
lay
his
hand
upon
the
low
roofs
in
passing
and
a
stout
bench
against
the
wall
offered
a
to
those
travelers
who
had
trodden
a
smooth
footpath
on
the
top
of
the
dike
now
and
then
the
horses
must
be
made
to
leap
a
little
bridge
and
the
darkness
was
fast
gathering
down
at
the
cottage
sides
there
were
wallflowers
on
the
and
in
the
last
that
they
passed
a
candle
was
already
lighted
and
bright
firelight
twinkled
cheerfully
through
the
lattice
they
met
no
one
all
the
way
but
once
they
were
confronted
by
a
quarrelsome
pushing
herd
of
young
cattle
returning
from
the
salt
outside
there
was
a
last
unexpected
glow
of
red
from
the
west
a
dull
gleam
that
lit
the
clouds
above
the
water
and
shone
back
for
a
moment
on
the
high
windows
of
the
inn
itself
and
brightened
the
cold
gray
walls
then
the
night
settled
down
as
if
a
great
cloud
covered
the
whole
country
with
its
wings
half
an
hour
later
john
davis
dismounted
with
some
difficulty
as
other
guests
now
in
the
inn
had
done
before
him
and
said
aloud
that
he
was
too
old
a
man
for
such
adventures
and
one
who
ought
to
be
at
home
before
his
own
good
fire
they
were
met
at
the
door
by
the
mistress
of
the
inn
who
had
not
looked
for
them
quite
so
early
though
she
had
had
notice
by
the
carrier
out
of
bristol
of
their
coming
there
was
a
loud
buzz
of
voices
in
the
inn
kitchen
the
place
was
no
longer
lonely
and
an
unexpected
second
troop
of
noisy
welsh
packmen
and
drovers
were
waiting
outside
for
their
suppers
before
they
took
the
evening
packet
at
the
turn
of
tide
the
landlady
had
everything
to
do
at
once
one
of
her
usual
helpers
was
absent
she
looked
resentful
and
disturbed
i
d
ought
to
be
ready
sir
but
i
m
swamped
with
folks
this
night
she
declared
i
fear
there
ll
be
no
packet
leave
either
the
wind
s
down
and
the
last
gust
s
blown
if
the
packet
don
t
get
in
she
can
t
get
out
tide
or
no
tide
to
help
her
i
ve
got
your
fire
alight
in
the
best
room
but
you
ll
wait
long
for
your
suppers
i
fear
sir
my
kitchen
s
no
place
for
a
lady
tut
tut
my
good
lass
said
the
alderman
we
ll
wait
an
welcome
i
know
your
best
room
t
is
a
snug
enough
place
and
we
ll
wait
there
till
you
re
free
give
me
a
mug
of
your
good
ale
now
and
some
bread
and
cheese
and
think
no
more
of
us
i
expect
to
find
a
young
man
here
later
on
to
speak
with
me
there
s
no
one
yet
asking
for
me
i
dare
say
we
are
before
our
time
illustration
along
the
dike
the
busy
woman
shook
her
head
and
hurried
away
banging
the
door
behind
her
and
presently
as
she
crossed
the
kitchen
she
remembered
the
young
gentleman
in
the
rough
clothes
upstairs
and
then
only
thanked
heaven
to
know
that
he
was
sound
asleep
and
not
clamoring
for
his
supper
on
the
instant
like
all
the
rest
i
ll
not
wake
him
yet
for
a
bit
she
told
herself
then
they
can
all
sup
together
pleasant
him
and
the
young
lady
davis
after
having
warmed
himself
before
the
bright
fire
of
coals
and
looked
carefully
at
the
portrait
of
his
majesty
king
george
the
third
on
the
parlor
wall
soon
began
to
despair
of
the
ale
and
went
out
into
the
kitchen
to
take
a
look
at
things
there
was
nobody
there
to
interest
him
much
and
the
air
was
stifling
young
wallingford
might
possibly
have
been
among
this
very
company
in
some
rough
disguise
but
he
certainly
was
not
and
presently
the
alderman
returned
followed
by
a
young
maid
who
carried
a
tray
with
the
desired
refreshments
there
s
a
villain
out
there
a
gallows
bird
if
ever
i
saw
one
he
said
as
he
seated
himself
again
by
the
fire
mary
hamilton
stood
by
the
window
to
watch
if
the
captain
might
be
coming
it
was
already
so
dark
that
she
could
hardly
see
what
might
happen
out
of
doors
she
envied
her
companion
the
ease
with
which
he
had
gone
out
to
take
a
look
at
the
men
in
the
great
kitchen
but
paul
jones
would
be
sure
to
look
for
her
when
he
came
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
wait
for
him
if
one
could
only
find
proper
patience
the
bleak
inn
parlor
scene
of
smugglers
feasts
and
runaway
weddings
was
brightened
by
the
good
fire
the
alderman
was
soon
comforted
in
both
mind
and
body
and
mary
concealing
her
impatience
as
best
she
could
shared
his
preliminary
evening
meal
as
she
had
done
many
a
night
in
many
an
inn
before
she
had
a
persistent
fear
that
paul
jones
or
his
messenger
might
come
and
go
away
again
and
she
grew
very
anxious
as
she
sat
thinking
about
him
but
as
she
looked
up
and
began
to
speak
she
saw
that
the
tired
old
man
could
not
answer
he
was
sound
asleep
in
his
chair
the
good
ale
had
warmed
and
soothed
him
so
that
she
had
not
the
heart
to
wake
him
she
resigned
herself
to
silence
but
listened
for
footsteps
and
to
the
ceaseless
clink
of
glasses
and
loud
clatter
of
voices
in
the
room
beyond
the
outer
door
had
a
loud
and
painful
creak
and
for
a
long
time
she
heard
nobody
open
it
until
some
one
came
to
give
a
loud
shout
for
passengers
who
were
intending
to
take
the
packet
then
there
was
a
new
racket
of
departure
and
the
sound
of
the
landlady
angrily
pursuing
some
delinquent
guest
into
the
yard
to
claim
her
pay
but
still
davis
slept
soundly
the
poor
woman
would
be
getting
her
kitchen
to
rights
now
presently
it
would
be
no
harm
to
wake
her
companion
and
see
if
their
business
might
not
be
furthered
it
was
not
late
they
really
had
not
been
there
much
above
an
hour
yet
only
the
time
was
very
slow
in
passing
and
as
mary
watched
john
davis
asleep
in
his
chair
his
kind
old
face
had
a
tired
look
that
went
to
her
affectionate
heart
at
last
she
heard
a
new
footstep
coming
down
the
narrow
stairway
into
the
passage
she
could
not
tell
why
but
there
was
a
sudden
thrill
at
her
heart
there
was
a
tumult
in
her
breast
a
sense
of
some
great
happiness
that
was
very
near
to
her
it
was
like
some
magnet
that
worked
upon
her
very
heart
itself
and
set
her
whole
frame
to
quivering
road
s
in
sum
such
a
man
as
any
enemy
could
not
wish
him
worse
than
to
be
himself
i
found
him
in
a
lonely
place
long
nights
he
ruled
my
soul
in
sleep
long
days
i
thought
upon
his
face
after
the
packet
went
there
were
three
men
left
in
the
kitchen
who
sat
by
themselves
at
a
small
table
the
shadowy
room
was
ill
lighted
by
a
sullen
fire
much
obscured
by
pots
and
kettles
and
some
tallow
candles
scattered
on
shelves
the
mistress
of
the
place
scolded
over
her
heap
of
clattering
crockery
and
heavy
pewter
in
a
far
corner
the
men
at
the
table
had
finished
their
supper
and
having
called
for
more
drink
were
now
arguing
over
it
two
of
them
wore
coats
that
were
well
spattered
with
mud
the
third
was
a
man
better
dressed
who
seemed
above
his
company
but
wore
a
plausible
persistent
look
on
his
sallow
countenance
this
was
dickson
who
had
been
set
ashore
in
a
fishing
boat
and
was
now
industriously
plying
his
new
acquaintances
with
brandy
beside
drinking
with
eagerness
himself
at
every
round
of
the
bottle
he
forced
his
hospitality
upon
the
better
looking
of
his
two
companions
who
could
not
be
made
to
charge
his
glass
to
any
depth
or
to
empty
it
so
quickly
as
his
mate
now
and
then
they
put
their
heads
together
to
hear
a
tale
which
dickson
was
telling
and
once
burst
into
a
roar
of
incredulous
laughter
which
made
the
landlady
command
them
to
keep
silence
she
was
busy
now
with
trying
to
bring
out
of
the
confusion
an
orderly
supper
for
her
patient
guests
of
the
parlor
and
sent
disapproving
glances
toward
the
three
men
near
the
fire
as
if
she
were
ready
to
speed
their
going
they
had
drunk
hard
but
the
man
called
for
another
bottle
and
joked
with
the
poor
slatternly
girl
who
went
and
came
serving
their
table
they
were
so
busy
with
their
own
affairs
that
they
did
not
notice
a
man
who
slipped
into
the
kitchen
behind
them
as
the
welshmen
went
out
as
the
three
drank
a
toast
together
he
crossed
to
the
fireside
and
seated
himself
in
the
corner
of
the
great
settle
where
the
high
back
easily
concealed
his
slight
figure
from
their
sight
both
the
women
saw
him
there
but
he
made
them
a
warning
gesture
he
was
not
a
yard
away
from
dickson
the
talk
was
freer
than
ever
the
giver
of
the
feast
in
an
unwonted
outburst
of
generosity
flung
a
shilling
on
the
flagged
floor
and
bade
the
poor
maid
scramble
for
it
and
keep
it
for
herself
then
dickson
let
his
tongue
run
away
with
all
his
discretion
he
began
to
brag
to
these
business
acquaintances
of
the
clever
ways
in
which
he
had
gained
his
own
ends
on
board
the
ranger
and
outwitted
those
who
had
too
much
confidence
in
themselves
he
even
bragged
that
captain
john
paul
jones
was
in
his
power
after
a
bold
fashion
that
made
his
admiring
audience
open
their
heavy
eyes
we
re
safe
enough
here
from
that
mistaken
ferret
he
insisted
after
briefly
describing
the
ease
with
which
he
had
carried
out
their
evening
plans
you
might
have
been
cooling
your
heels
here
waiting
for
me
the
whole
week
long
and
i
waiting
for
my
money
too
but
for
such
a
turn
of
luck
if
i
did
n
t
want
to
get
to
france
and
get
my
discharge
and
go
back
to
america
as
quick
as
possible
without
suspicion
i
d
tell
you
just
where
he
landed
and
put
him
into
your
hands
like
a
cat
in
a
bag
to
be
easy
drowned
he
s
in
bristol
if
you
must
know
dickson
went
on
after
again
refreshing
himself
with
the
brandy
we
set
him
ashore
to
ride
there
over
clifton
downs
yes
i
might
have
missed
ye
he
s
a
bold
devil
but
the
three
of
us
here
could
bag
him
easy
i
ve
put
many
a
spoke
in
his
wheel
there
was
a
young
fellow
aboard
us
too
that
had
done
me
a
wrong
at
home
that
i
never
forgave
and
that
night
at
whitehaven
i
ve
already
told
ye
of
when
i
fixed
the
candles
after
i
got
these
papers
that
you
ve
come
for
i
dropped
some
pieces
of
em
and
things
that
was
with
em
in
my
pretty
gentleman
s
locker
so
good
friends
were
parted
after
that
and
the
whole
whitehaven
matter
laid
to
his
door
i
could
tell
ye
the
whole
story
his
name
s
wallingford
curse
him
and
they
say
he
s
got
a
taste
o
your
mill
prison
by
this
time
that
s
paid
off
all
our
old
scores
i
hope
he
s
dead
and
damned
who
s
your
man
wallingford
i
ve
heard
the
name
myself
there
s
a
reward
out
for
him
or
did
i
hear
he
was
pardoned
asked
one
of
the
men
t
was
a
scurvy
sort
o
way
to
make
him
pay
his
debts
i
d
rather
ended
it
man
fashion
if
i
had
such
a
grudge
said
the
other
listener
the
man
who
had
been
drinking
least
dickson
s
wits
were
now
overcome
by
the
brandy
as
he
might
boast
himself
if
you
knew
all
i
had
suffered
at
his
hands
he
protested
he
robbed
me
of
a
good
living
at
home
and
made
me
fail
in
my
plans
i
was
like
to
be
a
laughingstock
the
two
men
shrugged
their
shoulders
when
he
next
pushed
the
bottle
toward
them
and
said
that
they
had
had
enough
come
now
said
one
of
them
let
s
finish
our
business
you
have
this
document
o
one
yankee
privateersman
called
paul
jones
that
our
principal
s
bound
for
to
get
you
ve
set
your
own
thieves
price
on
it
and
we
re
sent
here
to
pay
it
i
m
to
see
it
first
to
be
sure
there
s
no
cheat
and
then
make
a
finish
the
paper
s
worth
more
than
t
was
a
month
ago
said
dickson
shrewdly
his
face
was
paler
than
ever
and
in
strange
contrast
to
the
red
faces
of
his
companions
the
time
is
come
pretty
near
for
carrying
out
the
north
sea
scheme
he
may
have
varied
from
this
paper
when
he
found
the
writing
gone
but
i
know
for
a
fact
he
has
the
cruise
still
in
mind
and
t
would
be
a
hard
blow
to
england
t
is
all
rot
you
should
ask
for
more
money
answered
the
first
speaker
doggedly
we
have
no
more
money
with
us
t
is
enough
too
the
weight
of
it
has
gallded
me
with
every
jolt
of
the
horse
say
will
you
take
it
or
leave
it
let
me
but
have
a
look
at
the
paper
i
ve
a
sample
of
their
cipher
here
to
gauge
it
by
come
work
smart
i
tell
ye
you
ll
be
too
drunk
to
deal
with
soon
and
we
must
quick
begone
dickson
swearing
roundly
at
them
got
some
papers
out
of
his
pocket
and
held
one
of
them
in
his
hand
give
me
the
money
first
he
growled
give
us
the
paper
said
the
other
t
is
our
honest
right
there
was
a
heavy
tramping
in
the
room
above
as
if
some
one
had
risen
from
sleep
and
there
was
a
grumble
of
voices
a
door
was
opened
and
shut
and
steady
footsteps
came
down
the
creaking
stair
and
through
the
dark
entry
a
moment
more
and
the
tall
figure
of
a
young
man
stood
within
the
room
well
then
and
is
my
supper
ready
asked
wallingford
looking
about
him
cheerfully
but
a
little
dazed
by
the
light
there
was
a
smothered
outcry
the
table
was
overset
and
one
of
the
three
men
sprang
to
his
feet
as
if
to
make
his
escape
stand
where
you
are
till
i
have
done
with
you
cried
the
lieutenant
instantly
facing
him
you
have
a
reckoning
to
pay
by
heaven
i
shall
kill
you
if
you
move
and
he
set
his
back
against
the
door
by
which
he
had
just
entered
tell
me
first
for
heaven
s
sake
you
murderer
is
the
ranger
within
our
reach
she
is
lying
in
the
port
of
brest
answered
the
trapped
adventurer
with
much
effort
he
was
looking
about
him
to
see
if
there
were
any
way
to
get
out
of
the
kitchen
and
his
face
was
like
a
handful
of
dirty
wool
outside
the
nearest
window
there
were
two
honest
faces
from
the
roscoff
boat
s
crew
pressed
close
against
the
glass
and
looking
in
delightedly
at
the
play
dickson
saw
them
and
his
heart
sank
he
had
been
sure
they
were
waiting
for
paul
jones
half
a
dozen
miles
down
shore
who
are
these
men
with
you
and
what
is
your
errand
here
demanded
wallingford
who
saw
no
one
but
the
two
strangers
and
his
enemy
none
of
your
damned
business
yelled
dickson
like
a
man
suddenly
crazed
his
eyes
were
starting
from
his
head
the
landlady
came
scolding
across
the
kitchen
to
bid
him
pay
and
begone
with
his
company
and
dickson
turned
again
to
wallingford
with
a
sneer
you
ll
excuse
us
then
at
this
lady
s
request
he
said
grinning
the
brandy
had
come
to
his
aid
again
now
the
first
shock
of
their
meeting
was
past
and
made
him
overbold
i
ll
bid
you
my
hero
less
you
ll
come
with
us
there
s
five
pounds
bounty
on
his
head
sirs
he
told
the
messengers
who
stood
by
the
table
they
looked
at
each
other
and
at
dickson
it
was
a
pretty
encounter
but
they
were
not
themselves
they
were
both
men
moreover
and
wallingford
was
a
strapping
great
fellow
to
tackle
in
a
fight
there
he
stood
with
his
hack
against
the
door
an
easy
mark
for
a
bullet
and
dickson
s
hand
went
in
desperation
a
second
time
to
his
empty
pocket
the
woman
seeing
this
cried
that
there
should
be
no
shooting
and
stepping
forward
stood
close
before
wallingford
she
had
parted
men
in
a
quarrel
many
a
time
before
and
the
newcomer
was
a
fine
upstanding
young
gentleman
of
a
different
sort
from
the
rest
you
have
no
proof
against
me
anyway
railed
dickson
he
could
not
bear
wallingford
s
eyes
upon
him
his
dutch
courage
began
to
ebb
and
the
other
men
took
no
part
with
him
it
was
nothing
they
saw
fit
to
meddle
with
so
far
as
the
game
had
gone
he
still
held
the
paper
in
his
hand
you
have
n
t
a
chance
against
us
he
now
bellowed
in
despair
we
are
three
to
your
one
here
take
him
my
boys
and
tie
him
down
he
s
worth
five
pounds
to
you
and
you
may
have
it
all
between
ye
at
this
moment
there
was
a
little
stir
behind
the
settle
and
some
one
else
stepped
out
before
them
as
if
he
were
amused
by
such
bungling
play
i
have
got
proof
enough
myself
now
said
captain
paul
jones
quietly
standing
there
like
the
master
of
them
all
and
if
hanging
s
enough
proof
for
you
dickson
i
must
say
you
ve
a
fair
chance
of
it
when
you
ve
got
such
business
on
hand
as
this
let
brandy
alone
till
you
ve
got
it
done
the
lieutenant
was
pardoned
weeks
ago
the
papers
wait
for
him
in
bristol
he
is
safer
than
we
are
in
england
wallingford
leaped
toward
his
friend
with
a
cry
of
joy
they
were
in
each
other
s
arms
like
a
pair
of
frenchmen
as
for
dickson
he
sank
to
the
floor
like
a
melted
candle
his
legs
would
not
hold
him
up
he
gathered
strength
enough
to
crawl
toward
wallingford
and
clutch
him
by
the
knees
oh
have
pity
on
my
sick
wife
and
little
family
he
wailed
aloud
there
and
blubbered
for
mercy
till
the
lieutenant
shook
him
off
and
he
lay
still
groaning
on
the
flagstones
the
captain
had
beckoned
to
his
men
and
they
were
within
the
room
give
me
my
papers
dickson
and
begone
he
said
and
you
two
fellows
may
get
you
gone
too
with
your
money
stay
let
me
see
it
first
he
said
they
glanced
at
each
other
in
dismay
they
had
no
choice
they
had
left
their
pistols
in
their
holsters
the
business
had
seemed
easy
and
the
house
so
decent
they
could
not
tell
what
made
them
so
afraid
of
this
stern
commander
the
whole
thing
was
swift
and
irresistible
they
meekly
did
his
bidding
and
gave
the
money
up
it
was
in
a
leather
bag
and
the
captain
held
it
with
both
hands
and
looked
gravely
down
at
dickson
the
other
men
stared
at
him
and
wondered
what
he
was
going
to
do
but
he
only
set
the
bag
on
the
table
and
poured
some
of
the
yellow
gold
into
his
hand
look
there
my
lads
he
said
there
must
be
some
infernal
magic
in
the
stuff
that
makes
a
man
sell
his
soul
for
it
look
at
it
dickson
if
you
can
wallingford
you
have
suffered
too
much
i
fear
through
this
man
s
infamy
i
have
doubted
you
myself
by
reason
of
his
deviltries
and
i
am
heartily
ashamed
of
it
forgive
me
if
you
can
but
i
shall
never
forgive
myself
put
this
man
out
said
the
captain
loudly
turning
to
his
sailors
and
they
stepped
forward
with
amusing
willingness
take
him
down
to
the
boat
and
put
off
i
shall
join
you
directly
if
he
jumps
overboard
don
t
try
to
save
him
t
were
the
best
thing
he
could
do
dickson
wretched
and
defeated
was
at
last
made
to
stand
and
then
took
his
poor
revenge
he
sent
the
crumpled
paper
that
was
in
his
hand
flying
into
the
fire
and
paul
jones
only
laughed
as
he
saw
it
blaze
the
game
was
up
dickson
had
lost
it
and
missed
all
the
fancied
peace
and
prosperity
of
the
future
by
less
than
a
brief
half
hour
the
sailors
kicked
him
before
them
out
of
the
door
it
was
not
a
noble
exit
for
a
man
of
some
natural
gifts
who
had
undervalued
the
worth
of
character
the
captain
took
up
the
bag
of
gold
and
gave
it
back
to
the
men
this
is
in
my
power
but
it
is
spies
money
and
i
don
t
want
such
he
said
scornfully
you
may
take
it
to
your
masters
and
say
that
captain
john
paul
jones
of
the
united
states
frigate
ranger
sent
it
back
they
gave
each
other
an
astonished
look
as
they
departed
from
the
room
there
s
a
man
for
my
money
said
one
of
the
men
to
the
other
when
they
were
outside
i
d
ship
with
him
and
i
d
sail
with
him
round
the
world
and
back
again
so
that
s
paul
jones
the
pirate
well
i
say
here
s
his
health
and
good
luck
to
him
englishman
though
i
be
they
stood
amazed
in
the
dark
outside
with
their
bag
of
money
before
they
stole
away
there
was
nothing
they
could
do
even
if
they
had
wished
him
harm
and
they
could
brag
that
they
had
seen
a
hero
the
mistress
of
the
inn
had
betaken
herself
to
the
parlor
to
lay
the
table
for
supper
alderman
davis
had
just
waked
hearing
a
fresh
noise
in
the
house
and
the
lady
was
bidding
him
to
go
and
look
if
the
captain
were
not
already
come
but
he
first
stopped
to
give
some
orders
to
the
landlady
the
two
officers
of
the
ranger
were
now
alone
in
the
kitchen
they
stood
looking
at
each
other
poor
wallingford
s
face
was
aged
and
worn
by
his
distresses
and
the
captain
read
it
like
an
open
book
i
thank
god
i
have
it
in
my
power
to
make
you
some
amends
he
exclaimed
i
believe
that
i
can
make
you
as
happy
as
you
have
been
miserable
god
bless
you
wallingford
wait
here
for
me
one
moment
my
dear
fellow
he
said
with
affection
and
disappeared
wallingford
still
possessed
by
his
astonishment
sat
down
on
the
great
settle
by
the
fire
this
whole
scene
had
been
like
a
play
all
the
dreary
weeks
and
days
that
had
seemed
so
endless
and
hopeless
had
come
to
this
sudden
end
with
as
easy
a
conclusion
as
when
the
sun
comes
out
and
shines
quietly
after
a
long
storm
that
has
wrecked
the
growing
fields
he
thought
of
the
past
weeks
when
he
had
been
but
a
hunted
creature
on
the
moors
with
his
hurt
comrade
and
the
tread
of
their
pursuers
had
more
than
once
jarred
the
earth
where
their
heads
were
lying
he
remembered
the
dull
happiness
of
succeeding
peace
and
safety
when
he
had
come
to
be
wagoner
in
the
harvest
time
for
a
good
old
farmer
by
taunton
and
earned
the
little
money
and
the
unquestioned
liberty
that
had
brought
him
on
his
way
to
chippenham
market
and
this
happy
freedom
he
was
free
again
and
with
his
captain
he
was
a
free
unchallenged
man
please
god
he
should
some
day
see
home
again
and
those
he
loved
there
was
a
light
footstep
without
and
the
cheerful
voice
of
an
elderly
man
across
the
passage
the
kitchen
door
opened
and
shut
again
and
there
was
a
flutter
of
a
woman
s
dress
in
the
room
the
lieutenant
was
gazing
at
the
fire
he
was
thinking
of
his
mother
and
of
mary
what
was
the
captain
about
so
long
in
the
other
room
there
was
a
cry
that
made
his
heart
stand
still
that
made
him
catch
his
breath
as
he
sprang
to
his
feet
a
man
tall
and
masterful
but
worn
with
hardships
and
robbed
of
all
his
youth
there
was
some
one
in
the
room
with
him
some
one
looking
at
him
in
tenderness
and
pity
with
the
light
of
heaven
on
her
lovely
face
grown
older
too
and
struck
motionless
with
the
sudden
fright
of
his
presence
there
stood
the
woman
he
loved
there
stood
mary
hamilton
herself
come
to
his
alone
knew
the
other
side
of
the
world
the
flood
swift
are
the
currents
setting
all
one
way
no
modern
inventions
of
signals
of
any
kind
or
fleet
couriers
could
rival
in
swiftness
the
old
natural
methods
of
spreading
a
piece
of
welcome
news
through
a
new
england
countryside
men
called
to
each
other
from
field
to
field
and
shouted
to
strangers
outward
bound
on
the
road
women
ran
smiling
from
house
to
house
among
the
berwick
farms
it
was
known
by
of
a
day
late
in
october
that
madam
wallingford
s
brig
the
golden
dolphin
had
got
into
portsmouth
lower
harbor
the
night
before
madam
wallingford
herself
was
on
board
and
well
with
her
son
and
miss
mary
hamilton
they
were
all
coming
up
the
river
early
that
very
evening
with
the
flood
tide
the
story
flew
through
the
old
piscataqua
plantations
on
both
sides
of
the
river
that
major
langdon
himself
had
taken
boat
at
once
and
gone
down
to
newcastle
to
meet
the
brig
accompanied
by
many
friends
who
were
eager
to
welcome
the
there
were
tales
told
of
a
great
wedding
at
hamilton
s
within
a
month
s
time
though
word
went
with
these
tales
of
the
lieutenant
s
forced
leave
of
absence
some
said
his
discharge
by
reason
of
his
wounds
and
broken
health
roger
wallingford
was
bringing
dispatches
to
congress
from
the
commissioners
in
france
it
was
all
a
mistake
that
he
had
tried
to
betray
his
ship
and
now
there
could
be
no
one
found
who
had
ever
really
believed
such
a
story
or
even
thought
well
of
others
who
were
so
foolish
as
to
repeat
it
they
all
knew
that
it
was
dickson
who
was
openly
disgraced
instead
and
had
now
escaped
from
justice
and
those
who
had
once
inclined
to
excuse
him
and
to
admire
his
shrewdness
willingly
consented
to
applaud
such
a
downfall
the
evening
shadows
had
begun
to
gather
at
the
day
s
end
when
they
saw
the
boat
come
past
the
high
pines
into
the
river
bay
below
hamilton
s
the
great
house
was
ready
and
waiting
the
light
of
the
western
sky
shone
upon
its
walls
and
a
cheerful
warmth
and
brightness
shone
everywhere
within
there
was
a
feast
made
ready
that
might
befit
the
wedding
itself
and
eager
hands
were
waiting
to
serve
it
on
the
terrace
by
the
southern
door
stood
colonel
hamilton
who
was
now
at
home
from
the
army
and
had
ridden
in
haste
from
portsmouth
that
day
at
noon
to
see
that
everything
was
ready
for
his
sister
s
coming
there
were
others
with
him
watching
for
the
boat
the
minister
all
in
silver
and
black
major
haggens
with
his
red
cloak
and
joyful
countenance
the
good
old
judge
and
master
sullivan
with
his
stately
white
head
within
the
house
were
many
ladies
old
and
young
miss
nancy
haggens
had
braved
the
evening
air
for
friendship
s
sake
and
sat
at
a
riverward
window
with
other
turbaned
heads
of
the
berwick
houses
to
wait
for
madam
wallingford
there
was
a
pretty
flock
of
mary
hamilton
s
friends
miss
betsey
wyat
and
the
lords
of
the
upper
landing
lymans
and
saywards
of
old
york
and
even
the
pretty
blunts
from
newcastle
who
were
guests
at
the
parsonage
near
by
it
was
many
a
month
since
there
had
been
anything
so
gay
and
happy
as
this
night
of
mary
s
coming
home
major
langdon
s
great
pleasure
boat
with
its
six
oarsmen
was
moving
steadily
on
the
flood
and
yet
both
current
and
tide
seemed
hindering
to
such
impatient
hearts
all
the
way
from
portsmouth
there
had
been
people
standing
on
the
shores
to
wave
at
them
and
welcome
them
as
they
passed
the
light
was
fast
fading
in
the
sky
the
evening
chill
and
thin
autumn
fog
began
to
fall
on
the
river
at
last
roger
and
mary
could
see
the
great
house
standing
high
and
safe
in
its
place
and
point
it
out
to
madam
wallingford
whose
face
wore
a
touching
look
of
gratitude
and
peace
at
last
they
could
see
a
crowd
of
people
on
the
lower
shore
the
rowers
did
their
best
the
boat
sped
through
the
water
it
was
only
half
dark
but
some
impatient
hand
had
lit
the
bonfires
the
company
of
gentlemen
were
coming
down
already
through
the
terraced
garden
to
the
oh
mary
mary
roger
wallingford
was
whispering
i
have
done
nothing
that
i
hoped
to
do
but
she
hushed
him
and
her
hand
stole
into
his
we
did
not
think
that
night
when
we
parted
we
should
be
coming
home
together
we
did
not
know
what
lay
before
us
he
said
with
sorrow
no
dear
i
have
done
nothing
but
thank
god
i
am
alive
to
love
you
and
to
serve
my
country
to
my
life
s
end
mary
could
not
speak
she
was
too
happy
and
too
thankful
all
her
own
great
love
and
perfect
happiness
were
shining
in
her
face
i
am
thinking
of
the
captain
she
said
gently
after
a
little
silence
you
know
how
he
left
us
when
we
were
so
happy
and
slipped
away
alone
into
the
dark
without
a
word
oh
look
madam
she
cried
then
our
friends
are
all
there
they
are
all
waiting
for
us
i

her
white
apron

and

god

rose
and
stood
together

the
