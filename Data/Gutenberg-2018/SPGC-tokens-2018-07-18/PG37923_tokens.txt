that
prettiest

a

can
fancy
in

working
praying

sometimes
i

oh
is
a
delightful
state
when
every
man
one
sees
instead
of
tempting
us
to
sin
is
to
rebuke
us
for

such
sentiments
as
these
would
indeed
make
you
very
uneasy
but
believe
me
child
you
would
soon
bring
yourself
to
hate
mankind
fasting
and
praying
are
the
best
cures
in
the
world
for
these
violent
passions
on

should
want
neither

they

like
elephants

as

i
have
my

run
down
a

afterwards
for

but
come
where
is
my
old

my
old

i
suppose
this
is
the
hour
he
generally
employs
in

this
hour
ay
all
hours
i
dare
swear
he
spends
more
time
in
them
than
all
the
priests
in

give
him
his
due
he
was
wicked
as
long
as
he
could
be
so
and
when
he
could
sin
no
longer
why
he
began
to
repent
that
he
had
sinned
at
all
oh
there
is
nothing
so
devout
as
an
old
whoremaster
i
fancy
then
it
will
be
shortly
time
for
you
to
think
of
it
sir
ay
madam
about
some
thirty
or
forty
years
hence
it
may
odsheart
i
am
but
in
the
prime
of
my
years
yet
and
if
it
was
not
for
a
saucy
young
rascal
who
looks
me
in
the
face
and
calls
me
father
might
make
a
very
good
figure
among
the

but
tho
i
am
not
so
young
in
years
i
am
in
constitution
as
any
of
them

i
question
but
to
live
to
see
a
son
and
a
great
grandson
both
born
on
the

day
you
will
excuse
this

who
is
going

much
earlier
retire
then
it
is
with

you
a

why
madam
if
you
have
a
mind
to
hang
your
self
at
the

end
would
it
not
be
better
to
spend
your
time
in
matrimony
than
in
a

do
let
a
set
of
rascally
priests
put
strange
notions
in
your
head
take
my
word
for
it
and
i
am
a
very
honest
fellow

are
no
raptures
worth
a

but
those
in
the
arms
of
a
brisk
young
cavalier
of
all
the
actions
of
my

there
are
none

reflect
on
with
so
much
pleasure
as
having
burnt
half
a

delivered
several
hundred
virgins
out

oh
villany

i
must
reprove
you
for

within

i
shall
bring
this
haughtiness
to
a
penance

my

i
hope
your
account
is
not
long
you
have
not
many
articles
since

you

done
last

cheated
at

three
of
my
acquaintance
went
to
bed
without
saying
my
prayers
and
dreamt
of
oh
tell
me
the
particulars
of
that
dream
nay
father
that
i
must
be
excus
modesty
at
confession
is
as
unseasonable
as
in
bed
and
your
mind
should
appear
as
naked
to
your
confessor
as
your
person
to
your
husband
i
thought
he
embraced
me
with
the
utmost
tenderness
but
were
you
pleased
therewith
you
know
father
a
lye
now
would
be
the
greatest
of
sins
i
was
not
displeased
i
assure
you
but
i
have
often
heard
you
say
there
is
no
sin
in
love
no
in
love
it
self
there
is
not
love
is
not
in
nor
in
the
excess
is
there
sometimes
any
but
then
it
must
be
rightly
placed
must
be
directed
to
a
proper
object
the
love
a
daughter
bears
her
confessor
is
no
doubt
not
only
innocent
but
extremely
laudable
yes
but
that
that
is
another
sort
of
love
you
know
you
are
deceived
there
is
but
one
sort
of
love
which
is
justifiable
or
indeed
desirable
i
hope
my
love
for
is
that
that
i
know
not
i
wish
it
may
however
i
have
some
dispute
as
yet
remaining
with
me
concerning
it
that
be
satisfied
it
will
be
improper
for
you
to
proceed
any
farther
in
the
affair
all
the
penance
therefore
i
shall
enjoin
you
on
this
confession
is
to
defer
your
marriage
one
week
by
which
time
i
shall
have
resolved
within
my
self
whether
you
shall
marry
him
at
all
not
marry
him
at
all
sure
father
you
are
not
in
earnest
i
never
jest
on
these
occasions
what
reason
can
you
have
my
reasons
may
not
be
so
ripe
for
your
ears
at
present
but
perhaps
better
things
are
designed
for
you
a
fidlestick
i
tell
you
father
better
things
can
not
be
designed
for
me
i
suppose
you
have
found
out
some
old
fellow
with
twenty
livres
a
year
more
in
his
power
but
i
can
assure
you
if
i
marry
not
i
not
marry
any
perhaps
you
are
not
designed
to
marry
any

me
feel
your

to
put
any
one
in

i
was

have
been
married
to
a
pretty
fellow
and
now
i
must
defer
my
marriage
you
have
consider
whether
i
shall
marry
at
all
or
no
have
you
any
more
sins
to
confess
sins
you
have
put
all
my
sins
out

my
head
i

benedicite

you
shall
see
me
soon
again
for
great
things
are

at

i
leave
you
to
your

you
are
like
to
count
many
more
tedious
hours
than
you
imagine
ha
what
means
my

i
would
not
have
your
wishes
too
impatient
that
all
but
if
you
will
wait
a
week
you
shall
know
whether
i
intend
to
marry
you
or
not
and
is
this
possible
can
words
like
these
fall
from
sweet
lips
can
she
be
false
inconstant
perjured
oh
do
not
discharge
such
a
volley
of
terrible
names
upon
me
before
you
are
certain
i
deserve
them
doubt
only
whether
i
can
be
obedient
to
my

guess
the
rest
can
he
have
enjoined
you
to
be
perjured
by

it
would
be
sinful
to
obey
him
be

if
i
prevail
with
my

to
obey
him
in

more

can
afford
well
adieu

you
quite
full
with

since
you

here
promise
you
that
the

not
force
me
to
marry
another

i
will
either
marry
you

die
a

and
i
have
no
violent
inclination

the

a

it
is
the
former

there
been

rely
on
what
a
woman
says
out
of
a
church
than
on
what
a
priest
says
in
it
pardon
me
sir
but
i
should
have
very
little
appetite
to
marry
the
woman
whom
i
had
such
an
opinion
of
you
had
an
opinion
of
what
business
have
you
to
have
any
opinion
is
it
not
enough
that
i
have
an
opinion
of
her
that
is
of
her
fortune
but
i
suppose
you
are
one
of
those
romantick
whining
coxcombs
that
are
in
love
with
a
woman
behind
her
back
sirrah
i
have
had
two
women
lawfully
and
two
thousand
unlawfully
and
never
was
in
love
in
my
life
well
sir
then
i
am
happy
that
we
both
agree
in
the
same
person
i
like
the
woman
and
you
her
fortune
yes
you
dog
and
i
have
you
secure
her
as
soon
as
you
can
for
if
a
greater
fortune
should
be
found
out
in
i
make
you
marry
her
so
go
find
out
your
mistress
and
stick
close
to
her
and
i
go
seek
the
priest
whom
if
i
can
find
i
will
stick
close
to
with
a
vengeance
scene

jourdain
martin
alas
father
there
is
one
sin
sticks
by
me
more
than
any
i
have
confessed
to
you
it
is
so
enormous
a
one
my
shame
hath
prevented
me
discovering
it
i
have
often
concealed
my
crimes
from
my
confessor
that
is
a
damnable
sin
indeed
it
seemeth
to
argue
a
distrust
of
the
church
the
greatest
of
all
crimes
a
sin
i
fear
the
church
can
not
forgive
oh
say
not
so
father
i
should
have
said
will
not
or
not
without
difficulty
for
the
church
can
do
all
things
that
is
some
comfort
again
i
hope
however
tho
you
have
not
confessed
them
you
have
not
forgotten
them
for
they
must
be
confessed
before
they
can
be
forgiven
i
hope
i
shall
recollect
them
they
are
a
black
roll
i
remember
i
once
was
the
occasion
of
ruining
a
woman
reputation
by
shewing
a
letter
from
her
if
you
had
shewn
it
to
the
priest
it
had
been
no
fault
alas
sir
i
wrote
the
letter
to
my
self
and
thus
traduced
the
innocent
i
afterwards
commanded
a
company
of
granadiers
at
the
taking
of
a
town
where
i
knocked
a
poor
old
gentleman
in
the
head
for
the
sake
of
his
money
and
ravished
his
daughter

seldom
hear
any

what
does
he
mean

the
thoughts
of
a
nunnery
now
give
you
no
uneasiness
no
no
she
is
perfectly
reconciled
to
it
and
i
am
confident
would
not
quit
the

for
the
bed
of

ha
would
not
quit

marry
my

immediately
oh
folly
to
marry
her
immediately
why
ay
to
marry
her
to
the

means
you
see
into
what
errors
the
laity
run
when
they
go
without
the
of
the
church
and
would
interpret
for
themselves
what
they
know
nothing
of
i
take
this
opportunity
to
steal
off
and
communicate
a
design
of
mine
to
young
which
may
draw
this
priest
into
a
snare
he
little
dreams
of

can
not
see
how
that
should
be

for
tho
my

came
to
me
about
an
hour

and
swore
heartily
if
you
were
not
married
within

he
lead
you
to
purgatory
in

i
have
had
an
intimate
familiarity
with
the

i
know
them
all
there
is
not
one
of
them
cou
be
capable
of
saying
such
a
thing
oh
sir
i
saw

the

can
contradict

an

burning
a

really
a

great
service
done
to
himself
a

is
a
purge
for
a

observe
my
directions
in

you
commanded
me
this

well
and
did
you
perceive
any

alterations
in
your

any
extraordinary
emotion
i
can
not

i

he
wo
appear
in
any
horrible

that
is
to
be
averted
by
as
this
is
a
friendly

i
dare
say
you
may
prevail
on
him
to
take
what
shape
you
please
perhaps
your
father
or
if
you
can
not
prevail
for
a

you
may
at

pray
him
into

on
