chapter
i
a
warning
penny
nichols
flung
open
the
office
door
of
the
nichols
detective
agency
descending
upon
a
dignified
man
who
was
busy
at
his
desk
dad
she
announced
i
come
to
report
a
mysterious
disappearance
christopher
nichols
dropped
the
correspondence
upon
which
he
was
working
and
regarded
his
daughter
for
a
moment
his
gray
eyes
flashing
an
indulgent
welcome
what
sort
of
disappearance
he
inquired
cautiously
penny
laughed
as
she
opened
her
purse
disclosing
an
empty
coin
container
it
seems
to
be
my
allowance
again
yesterday
i
had
two
dollars
now
the
old
pocketbook
is
as
bare
as
mother
hubbard
cupboard
nichols
chief
interest
in
life
centered
about
his
charming
young
daughter
and
he
found
it
hard
at
times
to
keep
from
pampering
her
it
was
especially
difficult
at
this
very
moment
as
penny
stood
there
her
blue
eyes
twinkling
mischievously
her
full
red
lips
parted
in
an
enticing
smile
and
a
few
unruly
ringlets
of
curly
golden
hair
framing
her
forehead
in
an
artistry
both
casual
and
becoming
now
that
is
a
most
bewildering
case
he
agreed
with
mock
seriousness
i
do
suppose
that
roadster
of
yours
might
offer
a
clue
to
the
mystery
i
afraid
it
does
penny
admitted
only
this
time
i
indulged
in
seat
covers
instead
of
spare
parts
as
a
result
i
flat
broke
and
i
to
meet
susan
altman
at
the
tennis
courts
in
ten
minutes
nichols
smiled
indulgently
as
he
reached
into
his
pocket
for
a
roll
of
bills
i
come
to
the
rescue
this
time
young
lady
but
mind
i
charging
it
up
to
next
week
allowance
that
fair
enough
carelessly
penny
picked
up
several
papers
from
the
desk
studying
them
curiously
what
this
a
new
case
her
father
nodded
as
he
quickly
retrieved
the
documents
i
been
hired
by
the
reliance
insurance
company
to
track
down
a
gang
of
auto
thieves
sounds
interesting
unless
i
miss
my
guess
it
will
prove
a
baffling
case
i
am
afraid
we
may
have
to
postpone
our
vacation
trip
to
the
mountains
penny
ca
you
arrange
to
capture
the
bold
bad
men
a
little
ahead
of
schedule
penny
bantered
i
wish
it
would
prove
as
simple
as
that
it
seems
a
shame
to
give
up
the
vacation
because
you
worked
so
hard
lately
you
really
need
a
long
rest
we
both
take
it
when
this
case
is
solved
nichols
promised
run
along
now
for
i
particularly
busy
not
in
the
least
offended
by
the
abrupt
dismissal
penny
blew
her
father
an
impudent
kiss
as
she
went
out
the
door
since
the
death
of
nichols
many
years
before
penelope
and
her
father
had
lived
together
in
a
large
white
house
on
hilburn
street
with
only
gallup
an
elderly
housekeeper
to
see
that
the
establishment
ran
smoothly
it
was
not
surprising
that
under
such
an
arrangement
the
girl
enjoyed
rare
freedom
yet
penny
never
abused
her
privileges
and
she
enjoyed
the
complete
confidence
of
her
father
penny
owned
her
own
roadster
and
drove
it
well
to
be
sure
the
car
was
a
model
but
one
of
which
she
was
very
proud
for
she
had
paid
for
it
herself
by
teaching
swimming
at
the
automobiles
penny
discovered
to
her
chagrin
had
an
unpleasant
way
of
breaking
down
at
odd
moments
and
for
that
reason
her
expense
account
usually
was
far
ahead
of
her
allowance
occasionally
nichols
came
to
her
rescue
with
very
acceptable
gifts
of
tires
and
spare
parts
reaching
the
tennis
court
penny
parked
her
car
on
a
street
she
found
susan
altman
her
chum
already
awaiting
her
it
almost
too
hot
today
for
tennis
the
girl
complained
as
she
took
her
position
at
the
baseline
of
the
cement
court
preparing
to
serve
the
first
ball
for
two
long
hours
the
girls
battled
back
and
forth
although
usually
they
were
well
matched
upon
this
particular
day
susan
found
herself
unable
to
cope
with
her
companion
sizzling
service
and
drives
finally
after
completely
missing
a
ball
which
penny
had
sent
over
the
net
with
speed
she
threw
down
her
racquet
in
disgust
i
had
enough
punishment
that
makes
the
third
straight
set
won
it
getting
almost
too
dark
to
see
the
ball
penny
said
generously
shall
we
call
it
an
evening
and
finish
off
with
something
to
eat
they
crossed
over
to
eby
café
a
favorite
haunt
of
belton
younger
set
the
booths
were
quite
deserted
everyone
seems
to
have
gone
away
for
the
summer
susan
mourned
as
she
pondered
over
the
menu
i
suppose
you
be
leaving
soon
too
penny
no
chance
of
it
i
afraid
dad
has
become
involved
in
a
new
case
which
may
keep
us
in
town
indefinitely
i
wish
my
father
were
a
detective
susan
commented
a
trifle
enviously
it
too
bad
about
the
vacation
of
course
but
your
life
is
exciting
at
least
it
seemed
to
her
that
penny
always
led
an
unhampered
adventurous
existence
at
any
rate
the
girl
was
well
acquainted
with
interesting
happenings
at
the
belton
city
police
court
and
had
more
than
a
nodding
acquaintance
with
fascinating
personages
of
the
city
i
never
had
any
real
adventures
penny
declared
gloomily
unfortunately
dad
is
a
little
secretive
about
his
sleuthing
activities
i
give
anything
to
know
about
this
latest
case
her
voice
trailed
off
for
the
two
girls
had
heard
a
shrill
warning
whistle
which
they
instantly
recognized
as
the
fire
siren
although
they
had
not
even
begun
their
suppers
they
rushed
to
the
plateglass
window
to
watch
the
red
engine
clatter
by
why
it
turning
down
our
street
susan
exclaimed
oh
i
hope
our
house
is
afire
let
jump
in
my
car
and
follow
penny
proposed
they
hurriedly
left
the
café
penny
had
parked
her
roadster
just
out
of
sight
around
the
corner
but
as
they
viewed
the
car
they
both
stopped
short
in
amazement
the
rear
wheel
is
gone
susan
gasped
surely
that
ca
be
your
roadster
penny
it
had
grown
quite
dark
outside
and
for
an
instant
both
girls
believed
they
had
made
a
mistake
in
identifying
the
car
yet
one
glance
at
the
license
number
assured
them
that
they
had
made
no
error
a
daring
thief
had
jacked
up
the
rear
axle
stealing
an
almost
new
wheel
which
penny
father
had
purchased
for
her
only
the
previous
week
an
inspection
disclosed
that
the
spare
wheel
also
had
been
taken
i
never
heard
of
such
an
outrage
penny
stormed
why
we
have
been
in
that
café
fifteen
minutes
the
theft
was
accomplished
almost
under
our
eyes
i
hope
the
loss
is
covered
by
insurance
susan
said
anxiously
i
do
know
whether
it
is
or
not
dad
looks
after
everything
like
that
oh
dear
unless
i
can
get
in
touch
with
him
we
practically
stranded
here
although
the
girls
were
only
a
short
distance
from
nichols
office
they
were
nearly
a
mile
from
their
homes
the
roadster
had
been
parked
several
blocks
from
a
street
car
line
we
wo
be
able
to
learn
about
the
fire
either
susan
worried
i
wonder
if
it
could
have
been
at
our
house
it
is
likely
but
let
telephone
and
make
certain
even
as
she
spoke
they
heard
the
fire
engine
returning
from
its
recent
run
it
could
have
been
much
of
a
fire
susan
commented
in
relief
at
least
it
out
now
i
see
if
i
can
get
in
touch
with
dad
penny
offered
she
was
relieved
to
find
nichols
still
at
his
office
after
listening
to
an
excited
account
of
all
that
had
befallen
he
promised
to
come
over
immediately
and
take
charge
of
the
stripped
roadster
ten
minutes
later
he
drove
up
in
his
sedan
this
is
as
unfortunate
as
it
appears
he
told
the
downcast
penny
the
loss
is
completely
covered
by
insurance
besides
i
have
a
dark
suspicion
that
this
little
job
was
handled
by
the
same
gang
of
men
i
am
after
i
may
glean
a
few
valuable
clues
after
making
a
brief
inspection
of
the
car
nichols
turned
his
own
sedan
over
to
penny
directing
her
to
take
it
home
while
he
attended
to
the
stripped
roadster
and
reported
to
the
police
susan
had
promised
to
spend
the
night
at
the
nichols
home
so
the
girls
drove
directly
toward
the
house
on
hilburn
street
despite
nichols
attitude
regarding
the
theft
they
considered
it
an
event
of
major
importance
they
were
so
absorbed
in
an
animated
discussion
of
the
affair
that
they
were
taken
completely
by
surprise
when
a
policeman
held
up
his
hand
for
penny
to
stop
now
what
have
i
done
she
murmured
in
alarm
bringing
the
sedan
to
a
sudden
halt
at
the
curbing
i
hope
i
have
crashed
a
light
the
officer
stepped
up
to
the
car
window
are
you
miss
nichols
he
questioned
why
yes
i
am
penny
was
slightly
relieved
at
his
tone
i
recognized
your
car
and
knew
you
lived
in
the
neighborhood
i
thought
i
give
you
a
friendly
warning
a
warning
i
do
understand
we
on
the
lookout
for
a
crook
who
vanished
somewhere
in
this
vicinity
the
officer
explained
in
fact
he
ran
through
the
hedge
which
borders
your
place
did
you
search
the
grounds
penny
asked
with
interest
yes
but
he
made
his
i
just
thought
i
tip
you
off
to
be
careful
we
be
on
the
lookout
penny
promised
thanks
for
telling
us
the
officer
moved
aside
and
she
drove
on
again
i
had
almost
enough
excitement
for
one
evening
without
encountering
a
desperado
susan
declared
with
a
little
shiver
as
they
approached
the
nichols
residence
i
wonder
why
they
after
the
man
he
probably
a
jail
breaker
penny
returned
carelessly
susan
studied
her
chum
admiringly
you
the
most
casual
person
i
ever
knew
penelope
nichols
that
warning
give
you
the
creeps
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
did
think
much
about
it
the
man
would
be
miles
from
here
by
this
time
nevertheless
as
she
turned
the
car
into
the
gravel
driveway
keen
gaze
swept
the
dark
grounds
susan
likewise
surveyed
the
yard
anxiously
suddenly
she
uttered
a
low
cry
nervously
clutching
her
companion
arm
i
saw
a
shadow
just
then
she
whispered
tensely
i
do
believe
someone
is
hiding
in
the
lilac
bushes
chapter
ii
inside
the
trunk
penny
instantly
halted
the
car
on
the
driveway
peering
in
the
direction
which
her
chum
indicated
i
do
see
anyone
she
insisted
perhaps
the
shadow
you
saw
was
caused
by
that
big
tree
she
pointed
to
a
large
oak
which
shaded
the
rear
porch
of
the
home
its
swaying
boughs
did
produce
grotesque
silhouettes
upon
the
path
near
the
lilac
bushes
you
may
be
right
susan
admitted
reluctantly
only
i
was
almost
positive
i
saw
someone
i
think
your
nerves
are
a
tiny
bit
on
edge
penny
laughed
even
so
she
was
not
quite
sure
susan
was
mistaken
she
drove
the
sedan
into
the
dark
garage
as
she
was
preparing
to
close
the
heavy
double
doors
she
thought
she
heard
a
step
on
the
gravel
path
is
that
you
mrs
gallup
she
called
there
was
no
answer
i
right
susan
whispered
tensely
someone
is
prowling
about
the
grounds
there
no
one
about
penny
maintained
after
peering
carefully
around
probably
i
imagined
that
i
heard
footsteps
come
on
go
to
the
house
it
was
reassuring
to
see
a
light
burning
in
the
kitchen
the
window
shades
had
not
been
drawn
and
from
the
outside
gallup
could
be
observed
washing
dishes
as
the
girls
came
in
she
greeted
them
in
obvious
relief
i
so
glad
you
back
penny
i
was
beginning
to
be
afraid
that
something
had
happened
to
you
quite
a
bit
did
happen
penny
laughed
by
the
way
you
have
seen
anyone
prowling
about
the
yard
this
evening
have
you
why
no
i
been
so
busy
that
i
scarcely
glanced
out
the
window
early
this
afternoon
a
tramp
stopped
at
the
door
for
food
after
i
gave
him
a
sandwich
he
went
off
i
hope
he
has
come
back
to
make
trouble
oh
no
penny
assured
her
quickly
i
sure
there
no
need
for
alarm
then
why
did
you
ask
penny
was
forced
to
relate
what
the
policeman
had
told
her
although
she
realized
that
the
warning
would
worry
the
housekeeper
dear
me
i
do
feel
safe
with
your
father
gone
to
think
that
so
much
has
been
going
on
around
here
and
i
did
know
a
thing
about
it
why
i
have
even
locked
the
doors
i
doubt
that
it
will
be
necessary
now
penny
said
peering
into
the
refrigerator
to
see
what
she
could
find
for
a
belated
supper
dad
will
soon
be
home
anyway
i
going
to
lock
all
the
doors
and
windows
this
minute
gallup
insisted
firmly
with
so
much
silverware
in
the
house
it
is
wise
to
take
any
chance
lowering
the
window
blinds
in
the
dining
room
the
housekeeper
went
directly
to
the
buffet
removing
a
quantity
of
choice
silverware
which
had
been
in
the
nichols
family
for
several
generations
leaving
the
girls
to
forage
their
own
supper
she
carried
the
box
upstairs
intending
to
lock
it
in
her
own
bureau
drawer
returning
again
to
the
lower
floor
she
scurried
about
closing
doors
and
slamming
down
windows
since
she
bent
upon
doing
such
a
thorough
job
i
suppose
i
should
help
penny
remarked
to
her
chum
finish
your
supper
while
i
lock
the
back
door
do
forget
to
set
out
the
milk
bottle
before
you
barricade
us
in
susan
laughed
penny
picked
the
bottle
up
from
the
kitchen
table
and
crossed
the
porch
to
place
it
on
the
step
it
took
her
so
long
outside
that
susan
came
to
the
door
to
learn
what
detained
her
she
was
astonished
to
behold
penny
standing
as
rigid
as
a
statue
her
eyes
riveted
upon
the
garage
door
what
wrong
susan
inquired
did
i
close
that
door
when
i
put
the
car
away
penny
demanded
in
a
low
tone
why
yes
i
sure
you
did
the
wind
must
have
blown
it
open
penny
shook
her
head
the
door
has
a
special
catch
so
i
know
it
could
have
opened
by
itself
susan
i
believe
someone
has
sneaked
into
the
garage
since
we
left
it
susan
eyes
dilated
with
fear
involuntarily
she
took
a
step
backwards
turning
toward
the
kitchen
door
penny
caught
her
by
the
hand
do
tell
gallup
or
she
go
into
hysterics
let
find
out
if
there
really
is
anyone
in
the
garage
before
we
call
the
police
at
first
susan
hung
back
but
when
she
found
that
penny
was
determined
to
investigate
the
garage
alone
she
reluctantly
followed
her
chum
down
the
path
cautiously
they
peeped
into
the
garage
it
appeared
to
be
deserted
i
get
dad
flashlight
from
the
sedan
pocket
penny
whispered
she
tiptoed
across
the
cement
floor
groping
about
inside
the
car
she
found
the
light
but
before
she
could
turn
it
on
she
was
startled
to
hear
a
slight
sound
overhead
penny
heart
began
to
beat
a
trifle
faster
she
was
almost
certain
that
someone
was
hiding
in
the
little
room
above
the
garage
in
former
years
it
had
been
occupied
by
a
chauffeur
whom
nichols
employed
but
now
that
the
detective
drove
his
own
car
it
was
used
only
for
the
storage
of
a
few
old
boxes
and
trunks
do
you
dare
go
up
there
susan
whispered
tensely
sensing
the
thought
in
her
chum
mind
it
is
safe
it
safe
enough
if
you
stand
guard
here
at
the
door
penny
insisted
if
anything
goes
wrong
scream
for
mrs
gallup
before
susan
could
stop
her
she
tiptoed
across
the
cement
floor
and
quietly
crept
up
the
stairway
leading
to
the
storage
room
reaching
the
top
step
penny
paused
to
listen
she
could
hear
no
unusual
sound
yet
a
certain
intuition
warned
her
that
someone
was
in
the
room
systematically
she
flashed
the
beam
of
her
light
over
the
walls
nothing
appeared
amiss
my
imagination
is
running
riot
tonight
she
thought
in
disgust
there
no
one
here
she
started
toward
the
stairway
but
paused
unable
to
rid
herself
of
the
conviction
that
all
was
not
as
it
should
be
then
her
light
chanced
to
focus
for
an
instant
upon
an
old
trunk
in
one
corner
of
the
room
beside
it
in
a
crumpled
heap
lay
an
old
rug
from
her
father
penny
had
learned
to
be
an
unusually
keen
observer
she
was
positive
that
upon
her
last
visit
to
the
storeroom
the
carpet
had
covered
the
trunk
protecting
it
from
dust
summoning
her
courage
she
cautiously
approached
the
trunk
she
paused
to
listen
again
distinctly
she
could
hear
the
sound
of
soft
breathing
suddenly
she
flung
back
the
lid
a
man
cowered
inside
do
make
a
move
penny
warned
coolly
blinding
him
with
the
light
protected
as
she
was
by
the
darkness
he
could
not
know
that
she
had
no
weapon
do
shoot
he
pleaded
stepping
from
the
trunk
with
hands
held
above
his
head
it
was
then
that
penny
observed
that
her
prisoner
was
a
mere
boy
he
did
not
appear
to
be
more
than
a
year
or
two
older
than
herself
march
down
the
stairs
in
front
of
me
and
do
try
any
tricks
she
ordered
trying
to
keep
her
voice
steady
she
had
grown
a
little
frightened
at
her
own
daring
it
appeared
reasonable
to
suppose
that
the
youth
she
had
captured
was
the
same
crook
whom
the
police
had
warned
her
against
and
yet
the
boy
seemed
too
young
to
be
a
hardened
criminal
penny
decided
upon
a
bold
move
susan
stand
guard
at
the
outside
door
she
directed
as
her
chum
took
the
position
penny
reached
up
and
switched
on
the
garage
light
i
have
no
weapon
she
admitted
knowing
that
the
youth
had
perceived
the
fact
instantly
but
it
will
do
you
no
good
to
try
to
escape
for
the
police
are
combing
the
neighborhood
her
words
had
the
desired
effect
blinking
in
the
unexpected
glare
of
the
light
the
young
fugitive
shrank
back
against
the
wall
his
face
twisted
by
fear
do
they
suspect
i
here
he
questioned
have
they
surrounded
the
district
i
talked
with
an
officer
only
a
few
minutes
ago
penny
answered
truthfully
he
advised
me
that
our
property
was
being
watched
she
was
studying
the
boy
with
increasing
interest
he
was
exceedingly
well
dressed
and
while
his
garments
were
in
need
of
pressing
they
fitted
him
perfectly
disclosing
a
fine
physique
he
had
broad
shoulders
and
powerful
muscles
it
struck
penny
that
he
looked
more
like
a
football
player
than
a
crook
yet
as
she
studied
his
face
she
realized
that
it
lacked
character
do
turn
me
over
to
the
police
the
boy
begged
i
done
nothing
wrong
then
why
were
you
hiding
in
my
garage
it
true
the
police
were
chasing
me
he
admitted
reluctantly
but
they
mistook
me
for
someone
else
if
you
were
guilty
why
did
you
run
penny
demanded
suspiciously
why
did
you
wait
and
explain
you
ca
explain
to
a
cop
the
boy
told
her
with
a
scornful
curl
of
his
lip
you
see
i
have
a
juvenile
court
record
it
does
amount
to
much
but
the
police
wo
give
me
a
chance
i
been
trying
to
go
straight
but
every
move
i
make
they
watch
me
tell
me
your
name
the
boy
hesitated
then
said
quietly
jerry
barrows
i
mean
your
real
name
penny
smiled
a
telltale
flush
crept
over
the
youth
face
but
he
threw
back
his
head
a
trifle
defiantly
it
is
my
real
name
i
no
thief
either
i
admit
i
been
in
a
little
trouble
before
this
but
today
it
was
my
fault
another
fellow
and
myself
were
standing
in
a
crowd
when
an
old
lady
let
out
a
holler
that
someone
had
picked
her
pocketbook
the
police
came
running
they
spotted
me
right
off
i
had
been
near
the
old
lady
but
she
was
so
excited
she
was
ready
to
identify
anyone
when
the
cops
tried
to
arrest
me
on
suspicion
i
took
to
my
heels
what
sort
of
juvenile
court
record
do
you
have
penny
asked
nothing
of
consequence
once
i
was
in
a
gang
that
took
some
apples
from
a
pushcart
it
was
done
in
fun
but
the
judge
put
me
on
probation
on
account
of
it
penny
occasionally
had
visited
juvenile
court
sessions
and
in
many
respects
the
stories
she
had
heard
there
corresponded
to
jerry
account
of
his
difficulties
yet
in
some
ways
his
tale
did
not
ring
true
obviously
he
was
trying
to
convey
the
impression
that
he
had
never
had
a
chance
and
yet
he
wore
expensive
clothing
she
suspected
too
that
he
had
been
educated
in
a
school
fully
as
good
as
the
one
she
attended
i
am
sorry
but
i
must
turn
you
over
to
the
police
she
told
him
i
do
believe
your
story
it
does
hang
together
a
strange
change
came
over
the
boy
face
the
last
trace
of
arrogance
left
him
as
he
turned
pleading
eyes
upon
the
two
girls
i
lied
about
my
name
he
admitted
but
i
did
it
because
i
want
to
protect
my
mother
if
she
learns
that
i
am
in
trouble
again
it
will
kill
her
please
wo
you
let
me
go
free
even
as
the
boy
spoke
his
eyes
were
roving
to
the
door
it
would
not
be
difficult
for
him
to
overpower
the
two
girls
and
escape
if
he
really
chose
if
i
should
let
you
go
will
you
promise
not
to
get
into
any
more
trouble
penny
asked
suddenly
the
boy
nodded
i
find
a
job
and
keep
straight
would
you
really
work
if
you
had
a
position
penny
questioned
would
i
just
try
me
then
i
going
to
turn
you
loose
she
decided
come
to
my
office
tomorrow
at
nine
i
ask
him
to
help
you
find
a
position
where
is
his
office
the
boy
inquired
in
room
of
the
leader
building
you
see
his
name
on
the
door
christopher
nichols
nichols
the
detective
the
boy
questioned
uneasily
yes
but
you
need
be
afraid
he
turn
you
over
to
the
police
wait
now
and
i
see
if
the
coast
is
clear
opening
the
garage
door
a
tiny
crack
penny
peered
out
as
she
had
expected
there
were
no
officers
lingering
about
the
neighborhood
it
safe
to
leave
she
informed
he
started
away
then
paused
and
offered
his
hand
to
penny
thanks
for
giving
me
a
break
he
told
her
gratefully
i
really
meant
what
i
said
about
going
straight
with
that
he
darted
through
the
open
door
and
was
lost
in
the
night
chapter
iii
an
impulsive
act
i
do
know
why
i
let
him
escape
penny
said
as
she
closed
the
garage
doors
i
simply
did
it
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
one
could
help
liking
the
boy
susan
declared
optimistically
do
you
suppose
he
keep
his
promise
and
come
to
see
your
father
if
he
does
i
know
i
made
a
silly
mistake
i
hope
they
ca
put
me
in
jail
for
permitting
criminals
to
escape
you
might
look
very
well
in
stripes
susan
teased
they
would
never
become
me
because
i
too
plump
penny
was
in
no
mood
to
respond
to
the
attempted
banter
i
wonder
what
dad
will
say
when
he
learns
about
it
she
mused
uncomfortably
she
did
not
have
long
to
speculate
for
as
the
girls
turned
toward
the
house
nichols
came
down
the
walk
i
ca
get
in
at
the
front
door
he
complained
good
naturedly
has
gallup
locked
up
the
place
for
the
summer
penny
explained
what
had
happened
but
as
she
repeated
jerry
story
it
sounded
flat
and
a
trifle
ridiculous
she
was
not
surprised
that
her
father
listened
incredulously
why
were
the
police
searching
for
the
boy
he
questioned
i
did
learn
penny
confessed
i
have
only
the
boy
word
and
yet
you
expect
me
to
find
him
a
job
nichols
demanded
gruffly
if
he
ever
shows
up
which
he
wo
i
turn
him
over
to
the
authorities
oh
dad
you
would
not
after
i
gave
my
promise
that
you
help
him
why
should
i
assist
you
in
thwarting
justice
nichols
questioned
severely
penny
could
not
see
that
his
eyes
were
twinkling
are
you
trying
to
ruin
my
reputation
as
a
detective
i
did
mean
to
do
anything
that
might
embarrass
you
only
i
bear
the
thought
of
turning
the
boy
over
to
the
police
he
was
so
young
i
was
only
teasing
nichols
told
her
kindly
if
the
boy
does
come
to
my
office
i
have
a
talk
with
him
but
you
do
really
think
he
come
i
have
no
way
of
knowing
penny
i
must
admit
i
be
rather
surprised
if
he
appears
penny
relapsed
into
moody
silence
as
she
walked
toward
the
house
with
nichols
and
her
chum
she
had
begun
to
regret
her
hasty
action
i
left
your
roadster
at
a
downtown
garage
nichols
commented
switching
to
a
different
subject
i
notified
the
police
that
the
wheels
had
been
stolen
but
i
did
not
have
time
to
see
the
insurance
company
i
can
attend
to
it
in
the
morning
unless
you
care
to
do
it
yourself
i
may
as
well
penny
agreed
listlessly
she
was
feeling
very
gloomy
indeed
although
her
father
had
refrained
from
blaming
her
she
knew
that
he
was
amused
if
not
annoyed
at
her
behavior
above
all
else
she
coveted
his
admiration
cheer
up
he
said
lightly
as
the
three
entered
the
house
what
if
you
did
make
a
slight
blunder
all
detectives
must
learn
by
experience
a
fine
detective
i
make
penny
sniffed
i
fail
at
the
very
first
test
i
just
soft
hearted
i
guess
part
of
the
blame
should
fall
on
me
susan
declared
jerry
barrows
did
seem
in
the
least
like
a
criminal
nichols
i
was
impressed
with
his
story
too
i
feel
sure
he
must
have
been
a
very
persuasive
talker
the
detective
smiled
however
i
do
consider
that
either
of
you
committed
any
great
crime
in
permitting
the
boy
to
escape
so
i
should
worry
about
it
now
that
the
deed
is
done
nichols
regarded
the
incident
as
closed
but
gallup
had
heard
enough
of
the
conversation
to
surmise
a
little
of
what
had
happened
in
response
to
her
questions
the
girls
were
forced
to
relate
the
entire
story
penelope
nichols
i
never
thought
you
do
such
a
silly
foolhardy
thing
the
housekeeper
said
severely
she
felt
it
her
privilege
to
be
outspoken
for
she
regarded
the
girl
almost
as
a
daughter
why
that
young
criminal
might
have
killed
you
and
to
think
you
let
him
get
away
without
even
making
an
effort
to
call
the
police
i
sorry
about
it
now
gallup
but
i
thought
i
was
acting
for
the
best
please
let
not
talk
about
it
any
more
this
evening
the
subject
had
grown
very
painful
to
both
susan
and
penny
they
interested
themselves
in
backgammon
and
as
soon
as
they
could
do
so
gracefully
went
to
their
bedroom
i
never
hear
the
last
of
it
unless
that
boy
shows
up
at
office
tomorrow
penny
groaned
as
she
tumbled
into
bed
i
feel
positively
ill
over
the
affair
at
breakfast
the
next
morning
she
was
her
usual
cheerful
self
she
even
dared
to
hope
that
jerry
barrows
would
keep
his
promise
you
be
at
your
office
all
morning
wo
you
dad
she
questioned
anxiously
all
morning
he
repeated
smiling
quizzically
at
her
over
his
newspaper
if
your
young
friend
calls
upon
me
i
telephone
you
directly
after
breakfast
susan
insisted
that
she
must
return
home
as
her
mother
would
be
expecting
her
i
walk
along
with
you
penny
offered
i
promised
father
i
stop
at
the
insurance
office
this
morning
at
the
altman
residence
the
girls
parted
penny
continued
downtown
alone
nichols
had
furnished
her
with
the
address
of
the
reliance
insurance
company
and
she
experienced
no
difficulty
in
locating
the
office
after
stating
her
mission
she
was
ushered
immediately
into
the
presence
of
a
portly
gentleman
who
adjusted
insurance
claims
she
was
not
surprised
to
learn
that
her
name
already
was
known
to
him
so
you
are
christopher
nichols
daughter
the
man
remarked
with
interest
we
think
very
highly
of
your
father
here
in
fact
his
work
has
so
impressed
us
that
we
have
engaged
him
to
assist
us
in
stamping
out
this
gang
of
auto
accessory
thieves
but
of
course
you
already
know
that
my
father
did
mention
something
about
it
penny
murmured
of
late
the
gang
has
been
extending
its
activities
the
adjuster
went
on
warming
to
his
subject
why
last
night
alone
over
thirty
thefts
of
car
wheels
were
reported
to
the
police
thirty
penny
gasped
and
i
imagined
i
was
the
only
one
to
have
such
bad
luck
quite
the
contrary
you
merely
chanced
to
be
one
of
the
victims
of
a
systematic
combing
of
the
city
nearly
all
of
the
wheels
were
taken
in
a
relatively
small
downtown
area
now
in
all
probability
there
will
be
a
lull
in
the
activities
for
a
few
weeks
then
the
gang
will
make
another
large
haul
but
when
the
wheels
are
taken
in
such
numbers
i
should
think
it
would
be
easy
to
trace
them
penny
ventured
the
adjuster
shook
his
head
for
the
most
part
the
wheels
are
trucked
to
other
cities
for
disposal
the
serial
numbers
are
altered
and
the
stolen
goods
is
sold
and
distributed
to
dishonest
dealers
almost
before
the
authorities
are
aware
of
the
thefts
the
police
have
been
unable
to
cope
with
the
situation
the
adjuster
smiled
broadly
adding
now
that
your
father
is
on
the
case
we
expecting
a
little
action
i
sure
he
provide
it
penny
declared
loyally
the
adjuster
reached
for
a
form
book
and
after
asking
a
few
routine
questions
concerning
the
stolen
wheels
wrote
out
an
order
which
permitted
her
to
have
them
replaced
free
of
charge
at
the
garage
where
her
roadster
had
been
towed
penny
thanked
him
for
the
prompt
service
and
left
the
office
since
she
was
eager
to
have
her
car
in
operating
condition
with
the
least
possible
delay
she
carried
the
order
directly
to
the
hamilton
garage
a
courteous
attendant
promised
that
he
would
have
the
roadster
equipped
and
ready
for
the
road
within
a
few
minutes
you
need
a
new
standard
for
the
spare
too
he
advised
as
she
stood
viewing
the
crippled
car
when
the
wheel
was
stolen
the
thief
bother
to
take
it
off
instead
he
cut
the
standard
with
some
sharp
instrument
probably
with
a
little
hand
power
saw
is
that
a
new
method
penny
inquired
with
interest
walking
around
the
car
to
view
the
severed
pieces
of
metal
we
getting
quite
a
few
cars
in
here
that
way
the
attendant
returned
as
he
unbolted
the
ruined
tire
standard
and
tossed
it
into
a
corner
while
the
man
fastened
a
new
wheel
upon
the
rack
penny
went
over
and
curiously
picked
up
the
discarded
scraps
of
metal
she
noted
the
jagged
marks
which
the
saw
had
left
i
wonder
if
dad
might
not
make
use
of
this
she
thought
i
take
it
along
anyway
somewhat
to
the
amusement
of
the
garage
man
she
carefully
placed
the
pieces
of
steel
in
the
rear
compartment
of
the
car
penny
had
heard
her
father
remark
that
many
times
it
was
possible
to
trace
a
crook
by
the
tools
he
used
once
nichols
had
apprehended
a
kidnapper
by
means
of
a
ransom
note
which
had
been
written
upon
a
typewriter
with
a
characteristic
imprint
penny
hoped
that
the
scraps
of
metal
might
upon
scientific
analysis
disclose
the
type
of
instrument
which
had
been
employed
by
the
thief
to
sever
the
tire
standard
i
drive
directly
to
dad
office
and
see
if
he
can
make
use
of
any
of
these
old
pieces
she
decided
although
the
errand
provided
an
excellent
excuse
the
real
purpose
of
her
call
was
to
learn
if
jerry
barrows
had
kept
his
appointment
nichols
was
busy
in
the
inner
office
when
penny
arrived
but
miss
arrow
the
efficient
secretary
told
her
that
she
might
go
in
she
found
the
detective
engrossed
in
studying
a
group
of
photographs
and
their
accompanying
bertillon
records
trying
to
brush
up
on
who
out
and
why
penny
asked
banteringly
nichols
nodded
as
he
offered
a
photograph
for
her
inspection
this
is
one
of
the
men
who
i
think
may
be
involved
in
the
automobile
accessory
thefts
not
a
very
pretty
face
penny
commented
no
and
molberg
has
a
very
pretty
record
either
he
served
several
terms
in
the
pen
though
usually
he
a
little
too
smart
to
have
anything
proven
against
him
rap
is
the
ringleader
of
the
well
known
molberg
gang
it
begins
to
look
as
if
the
outfit
had
extended
its
activities
to
belton
city
is
this
rap
description
penny
inquired
indicating
the
bertillon
record
which
lay
upon
the
desk
it
consisted
of
a
bewildering
array
of
figures
hgt
oa
tr
hl
hw
can
you
decipher
it
nichols
smiled
i
know
the
hgt
stands
for
height
and
tr
for
trunk
but
what
are
the
other
abbreviations
oa
means
outer
arm
the
detective
explained
hl
represents
head
length
and
hw
indicates
the
head
width
of
course
all
the
measurements
are
reduced
to
meters
centimeters
and
millimeters
it
looks
complicated
not
after
you
become
accustomed
to
it
for
instance
i
can
see
at
a
glance
that
rap
molberg
is
five
feet
and
inches
tall
or
as
it
appears
in
bertillon
one
meter
centimeters
and
six
millimeters
i
do
believe
i
ever
care
to
be
a
detective
penny
smiled
it
too
much
like
studying
the
multiplication
table
crime
detection
is
a
scientific
profession
nichols
began
but
penny
cut
him
short
tell
me
did
jerry
barrows
come
to
interview
you
this
morning
no
and
i
very
much
fear
we
never
see
the
young
man
i
made
a
point
of
looking
up
his
juvenile
court
record
and
find
he
has
none
then
he
must
have
given
me
a
false
name
i
suspect
he
did
penny
i
guess
it
was
silly
of
me
to
trust
him
i
did
exactly
believe
his
story
at
the
time
and
yet
he
seemed
like
a
rather
decent
sort
too
i
not
worry
about
it
any
more
nichols
said
kindly
i
afraid
i
just
done
another
foolish
thing
too
penny
declared
she
then
told
him
about
the
severed
wheel
rack
why
i
like
to
examine
those
pieces
of
metal
the
detective
said
with
interest
what
did
you
do
with
them
they
in
the
roadster
i
parked
the
car
in
front
of
the
office
then
i
just
go
down
and
get
them
nichols
decided
i
should
have
inspected
the
car
more
carefully
last
night
but
i
was
in
a
hurry
wait
here
and
i
be
back
in
a
minute
during
her
father
absence
penny
amused
herself
by
looking
through
some
of
the
books
on
his
desk
there
were
several
weighty
volumes
devoted
to
criminology
and
law
she
found
them
dull
and
turned
with
more
interest
to
the
photograph
of
rap
molberg
he
had
the
appearance
of
a
typical
man
from
the
underworld
his
eyes
were
hard
and
glaring
there
were
sullen
cruel
lines
about
his
mouth
the
only
unusual
mark
of
identification
was
a
long
jagged
scar
across
his
left
cheek
in
the
outside
office
a
telephone
rang
penny
heard
miss
arrow
answer
the
call
apparently
the
secretary
was
unaware
that
nichols
had
stepped
from
the
office
for
she
said
just
a
minute
please
i
will
connect
you
with
him
an
instant
later
the
telephone
at
penny
elbow
jangled
she
took
the
receiver
from
its
hook
intending
to
explain
to
the
caller
that
nichols
had
left
the
office
before
she
could
speak
a
cold
precise
masculine
voice
came
to
her
over
the
wire
just
a
little
warning
mr
nichols
the
words
clipped
into
her
ear
lay
off
the
molberg
gang
or
else
penny
heard
a
receiver
click
the
wire
had
gone
dead
chapter
iv
the
molberg
gang
penny
signaled
frantically
for
the
operator
attention
it
seemed
minutes
before
the
telephone
girl
responded
mechanically
number
please
i
was
disconnected
with
my
party
penny
informed
tensely
see
if
you
can
trace
the
call
it
is
very
important
just
a
minute
please
there
was
another
long
wait
then
the
telephone
operator
informed
penny
that
the
call
could
not
be
traced
it
had
been
made
from
a
pay
station
nichols
entered
the
office
just
as
penny
hung
up
the
phone
anything
wrong
he
asked
quickly
noticing
the
expression
on
her
face
penny
repeated
the
warning
message
well
it
looks
as
if
i
on
the
right
trail
nichols
declared
not
in
the
least
disturbed
i
have
preferred
that
the
molberg
gang
had
learned
i
was
shadowing
them
but
such
news
travels
fast
through
underground
channels
i
afraid
some
of
those
dreadful
men
may
harm
you
penny
said
anxiously
promise
me
you
be
careful
i
am
always
careful
my
dear
but
i
refuse
to
go
around
wearing
a
bullet
proof
vest
this
is
the
first
warning
telephone
call
received
i
suppose
not
penny
sighed
but
i
should
think
that
if
the
members
of
the
molberg
gang
know
you
have
been
assigned
to
the
case
it
would
be
hard
to
secure
evidence
against
them
it
wo
be
easy
the
detective
agreed
however
i
flatter
myself
that
i
have
a
few
trained
investigators
whose
activities
will
never
be
suspected
you
mean
they
mingle
with
underworld
characters
and
try
to
gain
their
confidence
yes
that
the
usual
plan
when
i
locate
rap
molberg
i
have
him
constantly
shadowed
i
never
seen
many
of
your
assistants
around
the
office
penny
remarked
naturally
not
nichols
smiled
if
they
came
here
to
report
every
crook
in
belton
city
would
be
aware
of
it
within
an
hour
then
how
do
you
keep
in
touch
with
your
men
penny
asked
curiously
there
are
a
few
secrets
which
i
must
keep
to
myself
are
you
taking
a
rather
sudden
interest
in
my
work
penny
perhaps
i
am
since
my
car
wheels
were
stolen
i
feel
personally
concerned
in
the
case
i
wish
i
could
do
something
to
help
nichols
became
grave
there
is
nothing
you
can
do
penny
the
last
thing
in
the
world
that
i
could
wish
would
be
to
have
you
involved
in
the
case
in
fact
i
been
worried
for
fear
for
fear
of
what
penny
demanded
as
her
father
checked
himself
i
been
afraid
that
the
molberg
gang
might
attempt
to
strike
at
me
through
you
until
this
case
is
finished
you
must
be
very
careful
i
be
careful
although
even
for
you
i
refuse
to
go
around
wearing
a
bullet
proof
vest
penny
grinned
paraphrasing
his
previous
words
anyway
it
might
be
exciting
to
be
kidnapped
if
you
talk
like
that
i
see
i
must
assign
someone
to
keep
watch
over
you
it
wo
be
necessary
penny
assured
him
hastily
i
promise
to
stop
look
and
listen
before
i
make
any
rash
moves
as
if
to
demonstrate
she
tiptoed
to
the
door
opened
it
cautiously
peered
forth
at
miss
arrow
who
was
busy
at
her
typewriter
and
then
with
a
casual
goodbye
flung
over
her
shoulder
was
gone
the
following
week
was
an
uneventful
one
in
the
nichols
household
as
was
usually
the
way
when
nichols
became
involved
in
an
important
case
meals
were
served
at
odd
hours
and
often
the
detective
did
not
come
home
at
all
for
lunch
or
dinner
penny
complained
that
she
never
saw
her
father
certainly
she
heard
very
little
concerning
the
work
he
was
doing
for
the
insurance
company
on
a
wednesday
afternoon
she
was
in
the
back
yard
washing
her
roadster
with
the
garden
hose
when
susan
altman
came
running
up
to
relate
a
bit
of
news
penny
the
most
wonderful
thing
has
happened
what
i
to
have
a
car
for
my
birthday
present
not
really
yes
i
am
i
been
saving
money
for
two
years
but
i
never
made
much
headway
father
always
thought
i
was
too
young
to
have
a
car
too
until
this
summer
what
made
him
change
his
mind
mother
i
guess
you
see
she
has
to
have
the
family
car
a
great
deal
but
nothing
would
induce
her
to
drive
it
herself
i
to
have
the
new
automobile
as
my
very
own
providing
i
take
mother
wherever
she
wishes
to
go
that
should
be
an
easy
condition
to
meet
penny
smiled
what
kind
of
car
are
you
going
to
get
i
do
know
yet
i
thought
perhaps
you
help
me
select
it
i
love
to
after
running
this
old
bus
for
nearly
three
years
i
consider
myself
quite
an
authority
on
cars
i
can
buy
any
low
priced
model
i
wish
susan
went
on
enthusiastically
what
color
shall
i
get
one
that
does
show
the
dirt
penny
advised
promptly
as
she
coiled
up
the
hose
and
put
it
away
it
seems
to
me
that
i
spend
half
my
time
trying
to
keep
this
animal
of
mine
presentable
i
thought
i
might
like
blue
susan
ventured
i
do
suppose
have
time
to
go
with
me
now
and
look
at
a
few
models
would
you
of
course
i
go
wait
until
i
change
into
more
presentable
clothes
penny
darted
into
the
house
returning
in
a
few
minutes
where
are
you
going
to
buy
your
car
she
questioned
father
told
me
to
go
to
the
brunner
garage
on
second
street
i
drive
you
there
in
the
roadster
penny
offered
at
the
brunner
salesrooms
a
few
minutes
later
the
girls
were
greeted
by
the
manager
george
brunner
he
was
a
tall
thin
man
with
sharp
black
eyes
when
he
spoke
to
his
employees
his
manner
was
overbearing
and
haughty
but
in
the
presence
of
the
two
girls
he
beamed
and
smiled
and
hung
upon
their
words
he
talked
glibly
as
he
piloted
them
from
one
shiny
new
car
to
another
presently
susan
found
herself
hypnotized
by
a
blue
coupé
after
brunner
had
taken
the
girls
a
ride
in
a
similar
model
she
whispered
to
penny
that
she
thought
she
would
buy
the
car
why
do
you
look
around
at
a
few
other
places
first
penny
suggested
you
might
make
a
better
deal
i
afraid
to
wait
for
fear
father
will
change
his
mind
besides
this
is
exactly
the
type
of
car
i
like
penny
refrained
from
saying
more
but
she
was
sorry
that
her
chum
seemed
determined
to
make
such
a
hasty
transaction
for
some
reason
she
had
taken
an
instant
dislike
to
george
brunner
susan
however
noticed
nothing
amiss
in
his
manner
and
listened
spellbound
as
he
talked
glowingly
of
the
little
blue
coupé
i
think
i
take
it
susan
decided
hesitatingly
could
i
drive
it
away
certainly
the
manager
beamed
steering
her
gently
toward
the
inner
office
just
step
inside
and
we
fill
out
the
necessary
papers
almost
before
she
was
fully
aware
of
what
she
was
doing
susan
had
written
a
check
in
payment
for
the
car
and
had
signed
the
usual
legal
papers
do
you
think
i
made
an
awful
mistake
she
asked
penny
nervously
while
they
sat
waiting
for
the
car
to
be
serviced
it
a
beautiful
model
susan
and
if
it
operates
even
half
as
well
as
brunner
claimed
it
should
be
a
wonderful
bargain
you
did
like
that
man
very
well
did
you
no
penny
responded
shortly
the
brunner
garage
is
supposed
to
be
one
of
the
best
in
belton
city
i
know
it
is
i
have
a
thing
against
brunner
except
that
i
do
care
for
his
manners
the
discussion
ended
for
the
manager
had
returned
to
announce
that
the
new
car
was
ready
to
leave
the
garage
i
am
sure
you
will
find
it
perfectly
satisfactory
miss
altman
he
beamed
but
in
the
event
that
anything
go
wrong
hesitate
to
call
upon
us
i
remember
that
susan
said
with
penny
beside
her
to
offer
advice
she
drove
the
coupé
from
the
garage
turning
out
into
second
street
she
narrowly
missed
being
struck
by
a
truck
which
was
traveling
at
a
high
rate
of
speed
better
get
out
into
the
country
until
you
had
an
opportunity
to
become
accustomed
to
handling
the
car
penny
suggested
that
a
good
idea
susan
agreed
i
do
want
to
wreck
the
thing
before
i
drive
it
home
after
an
hour
of
straight
driving
on
a
deserted
road
she
became
quite
dexterous
at
operating
the
gears
when
she
felt
entirely
confident
of
her
ability
to
handle
the
car
in
any
emergency
the
girls
drove
back
into
the
city
they
parted
at
the
brunner
garage
where
penny
had
left
her
own
roadster
thanks
for
helping
me
select
the
car
susan
told
her
chum
gratefully
i
did
have
much
to
do
with
it
penny
smiled
but
it
a
fine
looking
automobile
i
wish
i
had
one
half
as
nice
i
let
you
drive
mine
whenever
you
like
susan
offered
generously
when
penny
reached
home
it
was
nearly
dinner
time
gallup
was
busy
in
the
immaculate
green
and
white
kitchen
frosting
an
angel
food
cake
any
mail
for
me
this
afternoon
penny
inquired
pausing
to
scrape
up
a
generous
spoonful
of
fudge
from
the
frosting
pan
i
declare
i
been
too
busy
all
day
to
even
think
of
the
mail
i
look
penny
went
to
the
box
at
the
front
door
there
were
three
letters
two
for
nichols
and
one
for
herself
the
latter
was
addressed
in
pencil
on
a
cheap
yellow
envelope
wonder
who
it
from
she
thought
with
interest
quickly
she
ripped
open
the
envelope
glancing
at
the
signature
which
had
been
signed
at
the
bottom
of
the
brief
note
jerry
barrows
she
exclaimed
eagerly
she
read
the
message
sorry
i
could
keep
the
appointment
with
nichols
the
boy
had
written
tell
your
father
to
be
on
guard
his
life
is
in
danger
chapter
v
penny
turns
sleuth
nichols
did
not
have
a
great
deal
to
say
regarding
the
note
which
penny
read
to
him
later
that
evening
at
the
dinner
table
do
let
it
worry
you
he
advised
just
put
it
away
for
future
reference
and
forget
about
it
future
reference
yes
it
always
wise
to
keep
such
communications
one
never
knows
when
a
sample
of
handwriting
might
prove
useful
i
sure
jerry
barrows
must
have
some
good
qualities
or
he
never
have
sent
the
message
do
you
think
so
dad
perhaps
it
obvious
the
boy
was
afraid
to
talk
with
me
but
why
should
he
warn
you
that
your
life
is
in
danger
do
you
think
he
could
know
anything
concerning
the
molberg
gang
it
is
likely
but
he
may
have
some
underworld
connection
i
getting
more
nervous
every
day
penny
declared
i
never
feel
very
easy
until
all
the
members
of
that
gang
are
captured
it
may
be
a
more
difficult
task
than
i
at
first
believed
her
father
remarked
frowning
i
know
that
rap
molberg
is
hiding
somewhere
in
the
city
but
so
far
none
of
my
investigators
have
been
able
to
trace
him
perhaps
he
through
causing
trouble
penny
said
hopefully
he
make
enough
when
the
time
comes
i
not
heard
of
any
automobile
thefts
or
anything
of
the
sort
for
several
days
that
just
it
things
have
been
altogether
too
quiet
it
like
a
lull
before
the
storm
a
bad
sign
nichols
abruptly
left
the
table
he
walked
to
the
door
then
came
back
i
must
go
downtown
again
this
evening
penny
he
said
regretfully
i
leave
the
telephone
number
of
my
new
office
in
the
event
you
should
need
to
reach
me
it
is
listed
in
the
book
of
course
your
new
office
penny
demanded
what
became
of
your
old
one
may
i
ask
it
still
there
nichols
smiled
miss
arrow
has
assumed
charge
and
i
taken
up
temporary
quarters
on
the
tenth
floor
of
the
atler
building
is
that
almost
directly
across
from
the
brunner
garage
yes
it
located
in
the
downtown
theater
district
the
bulk
of
the
auto
accessory
thefts
have
taken
place
in
this
relatively
small
area
from
the
window
of
my
new
office
i
secure
a
bird
eye
view
of
all
that
goes
on
in
nearby
streets
surely
you
do
expect
to
catch
the
thieves
in
the
act
of
stealing
automobile
wheels
penny
marveled
it
will
be
the
surest
way
of
gaining
a
conviction
if
a
professional
crook
is
captured
at
the
scene
of
his
crime
he
usually
is
clever
enough
to
cover
his
tracks
completely
an
amateur
is
seldom
so
skillful
in
obliterating
clues
may
i
visit
this
new
office
of
yours
penny
asked
yes
if
you
use
discretion
and
do
come
too
often
i
have
taken
the
office
under
an
assumed
name
john
bradford
i
should
care
to
have
my
real
name
known
for
awhile
i
be
very
discreet
if
i
come
penny
promised
her
father
turned
to
leave
it
must
be
dull
for
you
here
alone
at
night
he
said
apologetically
why
do
you
take
susan
to
a
picture
show
i
think
i
do
that
penny
agreed
after
nichols
had
left
the
house
she
telephoned
susan
altman
answered
the
call
informing
her
that
her
daughter
was
spending
the
evening
at
the
home
of
an
aunt
i
may
as
well
go
to
the
show
alone
penny
decided
one
of
her
favorite
movie
stars
was
showing
at
a
neighborhood
theater
only
a
few
blocks
from
the
nichols
home
penny
walked
the
short
distance
she
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
picture
remaining
to
see
part
of
it
twice
it
was
a
little
after
nine
when
she
left
the
theater
recalling
that
gallup
had
requested
her
to
bring
home
a
pint
of
ice
cream
she
crossed
the
street
to
the
nearest
drug
store
while
she
was
waiting
to
be
served
a
man
in
grimy
workman
clothes
slouched
into
the
store
he
pretended
to
interest
himself
in
a
cigarette
slot
machine
but
penny
noticed
that
he
darted
furtive
glances
at
the
waiting
customers
something
about
the
man
appearance
struck
penny
as
peculiar
she
conceded
that
he
looked
like
a
day
laborer
yet
his
actions
and
mannerisms
were
not
in
keeping
i
seen
him
before
she
thought
suddenly
the
picture
of
rap
molberg
flashed
into
her
mind
yet
as
she
scrutinized
the
man
a
second
time
she
could
see
only
a
slight
resemblance
to
the
photo
her
father
had
shown
her
however
as
the
man
moved
swiftly
to
the
nearest
telephone
booth
suspicion
began
to
take
root
in
identifying
underworld
characters
photographs
were
never
a
certain
guide
that
penny
knew
too
often
a
criminal
disguised
his
appearance
not
by
false
wigs
and
beards
which
even
a
novice
detective
might
note
at
a
glance
rather
by
altering
his
features
or
by
adopting
costumes
commonly
seen
upon
the
street
impulsively
penny
stepped
into
a
telephone
booth
adjoining
the
one
which
the
workman
had
entered
by
leaning
close
to
the
wooden
panel
she
could
hear
part
of
the
conversation
that
you
jake
he
asked
gruffly
everything
set
for
the
big
haul
we
all
ready
to
go
ahead
whenever
the
boss
gives
the
word
by
this
time
penny
was
almost
certain
that
she
was
listening
to
the
voice
of
rap
molberg
although
in
general
the
man
did
not
resemble
the
photo
which
she
had
seen
the
color
of
his
eyes
and
the
expression
of
his
mouth
were
identical
his
build
seemed
to
correspond
to
the
figures
of
the
bertillon
record
a
minute
later
the
man
slammed
down
the
telephone
receiver
and
left
the
booth
penny
waited
until
he
was
out
of
the
store
then
dropped
a
nickle
in
the
slot
she
called
the
number
which
her
father
had
given
her
there
was
no
response
at
the
other
end
of
the
line
i
suppose
he
left
the
office
she
thought
frantically
oh
i
ca
let
that
man
get
away
she
rushed
from
the
drug
store
and
reached
the
street
just
in
time
to
see
the
workman
disappear
around
a
corner
i
wonder
if
i
dare
attempt
to
shadow
him
penny
debated
she
was
a
little
afraid
yet
the
streets
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
theater
were
well
lighted
and
it
did
not
seem
too
dangerous
turning
the
corner
she
caught
sight
of
the
man
far
ahead
he
was
walking
rapidly
she
too
quickened
her
step
but
took
care
not
to
approach
close
enough
to
arouse
his
suspicion
presently
the
man
paused
beside
a
fine
looking
automobile
which
had
been
parked
at
the
curbing
as
he
glanced
sharply
up
and
down
the
street
penny
pretended
to
be
looking
into
the
window
of
a
jewelry
store
actually
she
was
watching
the
man
reflection
in
the
glass
she
saw
him
step
into
the
car
take
a
key
from
his
pocket
and
turn
on
the
ignition
as
he
drove
away
penny
quickly
noted
down
the
license
number
she
glanced
hopefully
up
the
street
but
there
was
no
policeman
within
sight
a
taxi
cab
driver
noticing
her
agitated
expression
cruised
close
to
the
curb
penny
hailed
him
follow
that
green
car
ahead
she
directed
tersely
climbing
in
do
let
it
get
out
of
your
sight
at
the
first
corner
they
were
held
up
by
a
light
which
was
changing
from
caution
yellow
to
red
risking
arrest
the
taxi
driver
crashed
it
the
green
car
ahead
had
picked
up
speed
it
weaved
in
and
out
of
traffic
in
a
dangerous
manner
driven
by
a
man
who
was
both
skillful
and
reckless
the
pursuit
led
into
the
hilly
crooked
streets
upon
which
the
older
section
of
belton
city
had
been
built
as
they
raced
down
first
one
narrow
street
and
then
another
turning
corners
at
a
breathless
speed
penny
suspected
that
the
man
had
become
aware
that
he
was
being
followed
her
driver
had
increasing
difficulty
in
keeping
him
in
sight
the
right
hand
turn
penny
cried
as
the
hesitated
at
an
intersection
they
tore
down
a
dark
twisting
street
at
a
speed
suddenly
the
driver
slammed
on
his
brakes
the
thoroughfare
had
come
to
an
abrupt
end
it
a
the
taximan
said
in
disgust
turning
the
cab
around
he
could
have
come
this
way
i
sure
he
did
penny
insisted
the
street
was
short
and
she
could
see
its
entire
length
the
green
car
had
vanished
there
were
no
houses
or
garages
into
which
the
automobile
might
have
turned
on
either
side
of
the
street
stood
factory
and
manufacturing
buildings
shall
i
try
another
road
the
driver
questioned
it
no
use
now
i
guess
we
lost
him
but
i
was
positive
that
man
came
this
way
i
do
see
how
i
lost
him
she
gave
her
home
address
to
the
driver
and
sank
back
against
the
cushions
completely
disgusted
with
the
turn
of
events
as
penny
alighted
at
her
own
door
she
cast
a
speculative
glance
toward
the
lighted
window
if
her
father
had
not
returned
gallup
was
almost
certain
to
ask
embarrassing
questions
concerning
her
arrival
in
a
taxicab
and
i
forgot
the
ice
cream
too
she
thought
i
have
a
nice
time
explaining
however
it
was
not
necessary
to
give
an
account
of
her
activities
gallup
met
her
at
the
door
you
came
just
in
time
penny
you
wanted
on
the
telephone
it
is
father
no
the
housekeeper
assured
her
i
think
it
your
chum
susan
yes
gallup
pushed
her
gently
toward
the
telephone
the
girl
seems
to
be
greatly
excited
over
something
do
hurry
and
answer
for
she
been
waiting
several
minutes
now
chapter
vi
susan
misfortune
when
penny
answered
the
telephone
she
heard
her
chum
agitated
voice
i
know
i
should
bother
you
so
late
in
the
evening
susan
began
excitedly
but
i
had
the
worst
luck
with
my
new
car
you
have
been
in
a
collision
no
it
is
quite
that
bad
but
i
stranded
on
eighth
avenue
and
i
ca
reach
my
folks
by
telephone
i
drive
over
and
get
you
penny
offered
what
the
matter
anyway
has
the
engine
balked
already
the
car
has
been
stripped
by
thieves
i
so
furious
i
ca
even
talk
about
it
i
come
right
over
and
see
for
myself
penny
declared
pausing
only
long
enough
to
tell
gallup
where
she
was
going
penny
backed
her
roadster
from
the
garage
she
located
susan
not
far
from
eighth
avenue
and
clark
sitting
gloomily
behind
the
wheel
of
her
new
coupé
as
penny
drove
up
she
saw
that
the
spare
wheel
was
missing
a
spotlight
was
gone
and
likewise
a
reflecting
mirror
the
thieves
very
obligingly
left
me
the
steering
wheel
susan
greeted
her
friend
when
a
person
ca
park
fifteen
minutes
without
having
everything
stolen
i
think
it
time
for
the
police
to
get
busy
how
did
you
happen
to
be
parked
downtown
penny
inquired
your
mother
said
you
had
gone
to
visit
an
aunt
i
did
but
on
the
way
home
i
stopped
at
the
y
for
a
swim
i
should
have
left
the
car
on
a
lot
but
i
thought
i
save
the
quarter
now
witness
the
result
you
still
have
four
tires
penny
pointed
out
that
more
than
they
left
me
yes
but
they
done
something
to
the
engine
it
wo
start
that
why
i
called
you
penny
lifted
the
hood
to
look
at
the
motor
susan
peered
anxiously
over
her
shoulder
can
you
tell
what
wrong
it
looks
to
me
as
if
some
of
the
vital
parts
are
missing
offhand
say
it
was
the
generator
what
a
generator
susan
asked
blankly
are
they
very
expensive
i
do
know
but
i
imagine
they
are
is
your
car
covered
by
insurance
susan
no
it
is
we
intended
to
take
it
out
but
we
did
think
a
few
days
delay
would
make
any
difference
thieves
seem
to
favor
new
cars
i
realize
that
now
susan
said
ruefully
you
know
i
noticed
a
rather
queer
thing
as
i
came
out
of
the
y
a
garage
service
car
was
standing
beside
my
coupé
it
drove
away
as
i
came
toward
it
a
service
car
penny
demanded
alertly
did
you
see
what
garage
it
was
from
no
i
did
in
fact
i
scarcely
paid
any
attention
at
the
time
for
it
was
until
i
had
reached
my
car
that
i
realized
it
had
been
stripped
you
must
have
surprised
the
thieves
in
the
act
penny
said
excitedly
undoubtedly
they
are
using
the
service
truck
as
a
front
to
escape
detection
how
do
you
mean
why
they
drive
up
in
the
truck
and
pretend
to
be
changing
a
tire
or
repairing
the
engine
passersby
notice
nothing
amiss
but
what
if
the
owner
appears
they
drive
away
or
if
actually
caught
claim
that
they
have
made
a
mistake
in
identifying
the
car
of
a
customer
the
driver
of
the
garage
truck
did
act
suspiciously
susan
admitted
i
was
stupid
not
to
jot
down
the
license
number
the
girls
were
talking
so
earnestly
that
they
failed
to
note
the
approach
of
a
policeman
he
paused
to
see
what
was
wrong
wheel
stolen
he
asked
surveying
the
car
critically
the
wheel
the
generator
and
almost
everything
detachable
susan
informed
i
was
only
gone
a
few
minutes
too
have
you
reported
to
headquarters
susan
shook
her
head
what
the
use
you
might
recover
your
stolen
property
the
policeman
said
optimistically
taking
a
notebook
from
his
pocket
your
name
and
address
susan
gave
it
and
furnished
such
information
as
she
could
regarding
the
theft
your
car
was
the
only
one
that
was
stripped
in
this
neighborhood
tonight
the
officer
told
her
not
fifteen
minutes
ago
i
ran
into
a
similar
case
i
think
it
time
the
police
did
something
about
it
susan
said
somewhat
crossly
we
up
against
a
tough
gang
miss
our
force
is
small
and
we
place
a
man
on
every
street
corner
as
the
officer
continued
to
make
out
his
report
a
girl
came
running
toward
the
little
group
she
was
about
penny
age
though
much
thinner
her
black
hair
blew
in
the
wind
unrestrained
by
hat
or
beret
oh
father
she
cried
in
agitation
the
policeman
turned
quickly
around
why
betty
what
brings
you
here
he
questioned
in
surprise
i
been
following
you
for
two
blocks
the
girl
said
breathlessly
i
wanted
to
her
voice
trailed
off
she
had
noticed
susan
and
penny
slowly
her
eyes
swept
over
the
dismantled
car
then
they
roved
to
her
father
with
an
expression
which
was
akin
to
panic
what
was
it
you
wanted
betty
he
asked
it
does
matter
now
she
stammered
she
added
tensely
father
you
not
making
out
a
report
certainly
i
am
do
do
it
the
girl
pleaded
gripping
his
arm
you
know
what
it
may
mean
please
for
my
sake
penny
and
susan
exchanged
a
quick
glance
they
were
at
a
loss
to
understand
the
girl
strange
attitude
why
should
she
be
so
troubled
because
her
father
was
writing
out
a
routine
report
of
a
theft
to
their
relief
the
policeman
laughed
carelessly
and
went
on
making
out
the
report
you
hysterical
betty
he
accused
come
get
a
grip
upon
yourself
i
sorry
the
girl
murmured
glancing
nervously
at
penny
and
susan
i
should
have
made
such
a
request
my
daughter
is
very
excitable
the
officer
said
apologetically
she
did
really
mean
what
she
said
there
was
an
awkward
pause
penny
turned
to
the
girl
and
questioned
kindly
have
i
seen
you
somewhere
your
face
is
familiar
i
watched
you
swim
at
the
pool
you
dive
beautifully
too
oh
i
remember
you
now
but
i
do
know
your
name
i
am
betty
davis
you
already
met
my
father
jerome
davis
the
officer
added
just
a
sidewalk
pounder
the
girls
smiled
at
the
disparaging
remark
penny
mentioned
her
own
name
you
not
related
to
christopher
nichols
the
officer
asked
yes
i
am
his
daughter
you
do
say
well
i
am
glad
to
make
your
acquaintance
down
at
the
station
they
think
a
lot
of
your
father
he
was
on
the
force
many
years
ago
i
believe
penny
said
politely
that
was
before
my
time
but
i
always
hearing
about
him
solved
some
difficult
cases
that
have
baffled
our
best
detectives
penny
made
a
perfunctory
response
and
the
officer
turned
to
his
daughter
betty
you
should
be
out
alone
so
late
at
night
you
must
go
back
home
at
once
if
you
live
nearby
i
be
glad
to
take
you
in
my
car
penny
offered
i
should
like
to
trouble
you
the
girl
said
hastily
my
home
is
only
a
few
blocks
away
it
will
be
no
trouble
at
all
penny
insisted
opening
the
door
of
her
roadster
do
let
me
give
you
a
lift
the
girl
flashed
her
father
an
appealing
glance
it
was
obvious
to
both
penny
and
susan
that
she
was
greatly
upset
about
something
yet
the
officer
appeared
not
to
notice
he
did
not
seem
to
realize
that
she
wished
to
speak
with
him
privately
it
very
kind
of
you
to
take
my
daughter
home
miss
nichols
he
said
quietly
do
keep
them
waiting
betty
reluctantly
the
girl
crowded
into
the
seat
beside
penny
and
susan
i
live
at
clair
avenue
she
informed
briefly
as
they
drove
slowly
along
penny
had
an
opportunity
to
study
the
girl
she
was
an
odd
type
serious
and
certainly
not
talkative
when
drawn
into
conversation
her
answers
were
given
in
monosyllables
she
worrying
over
something
penny
thought
the
car
halted
before
a
modest
brown
cottage
on
clair
avenue
betty
davis
alighted
thank
you
so
much
for
bringing
me
home
she
told
penny
gratefully
she
hesitated
then
added
earnestly
i
know
you
thought
it
queer
because
i
asked
my
father
not
to
make
that
report
i
sure
you
must
have
had
a
very
good
reason
penny
returned
i
was
overwrought
or
i
should
have
made
the
request
you
see
my
father
is
in
great
danger
i
do
quite
understand
already
betty
davis
felt
that
she
was
revealing
too
much
i
wish
i
could
tell
you
about
it
but
i
do
dare
she
murmured
with
that
she
turned
and
ran
into
the
house
chapter
vii
an
awkward
situation
now
just
what
did
she
mean
by
that
remark
susan
demanded
of
her
chum
as
they
saw
betty
davis
disappear
inside
the
cottage
i
not
a
mind
reader
penny
returned
with
a
shrug
the
air
seems
to
be
filled
with
mysteries
this
evening
she
then
told
of
her
experience
in
shadowing
the
man
whom
she
had
believed
to
be
rap
molberg
susan
listened
in
amazement
you
must
have
lost
your
senses
penny
nichols
if
you
turn
up
missing
some
morning
it
will
be
easy
to
guess
the
reason
why
perhaps
it
was
a
foolish
thing
to
do
but
i
thought
if
i
could
learn
rap
molberg
hideout
it
would
be
a
big
help
to
dad
investigators
from
the
agency
have
been
searching
days
for
that
man
you
should
leave
the
job
to
them
then
susan
advised
severely
i
guess
i
will
penny
said
ruefully
at
any
rate
i
failed
at
it
after
dropping
susan
off
at
the
altman
residence
she
drove
on
to
her
own
home
nichols
was
nervously
pacing
the
living
room
floor
when
penny
entered
i
glad
you
here
he
said
in
relief
gallup
told
me
you
had
gone
off
after
receiving
a
telephone
call
i
was
afraid
it
might
have
been
a
i
went
to
meet
susan
did
gallup
explain
no
but
it
does
matter
now
i
should
have
worried
only
things
have
been
popping
in
the
city
tonight
the
tire
theft
gang
is
at
work
again
yes
they
made
a
big
haul
when
the
story
gets
out
the
nichols
detective
agency
is
going
to
appear
in
a
very
good
light
you
have
been
working
long
on
the
case
dad
true
but
to
date
the
result
of
our
investigation
has
been
disappointing
this
haul
tonight
has
all
the
earmarks
of
rap
hand
yet
my
men
can
find
no
trace
of
him
in
the
city
penny
could
not
restrain
her
news
an
instant
longer
she
half
expected
that
her
father
would
scold
her
for
the
taxicab
escapade
but
to
her
surprise
he
became
mildly
excited
can
you
give
me
an
accurate
description
of
the
man
penny
he
was
about
five
and
a
half
feet
in
height
and
wore
clothes
undoubtedly
a
disguise
the
detective
interposed
his
eyes
were
dark
the
expression
of
his
mouth
was
sullen
his
teeth
were
uneven
did
you
notice
a
scar
on
his
cheek
no
the
mark
is
really
significant
for
rap
molberg
would
be
clever
enough
to
hide
it
did
you
observe
anything
more
he
seemed
extremely
nervous
and
the
telephone
conversation
made
me
suspicious
oh
yes
when
he
drove
away
i
copied
down
the
license
number
let
me
see
it
nichols
said
eagerly
she
handed
it
to
him
penny
you
done
a
fine
piece
of
work
he
praised
but
i
let
him
get
away
you
could
help
that
this
license
number
may
make
it
possible
for
us
to
trace
him
i
telephone
police
headquarters
right
now
and
see
if
they
know
anything
about
the
car
he
sought
a
telephone
in
an
adjoining
room
penny
lingered
by
his
elbow
while
he
made
the
call
after
talking
for
some
minutes
he
hung
up
the
receiver
i
was
afraid
we
might
run
into
this
penny
the
license
number
which
you
noted
down
belongs
to
a
stolen
car
then
it
wo
be
of
any
use
to
you
probably
not
a
great
deal
but
do
feel
disappointed
it
your
fault
that
the
man
got
away
he
has
eluded
some
very
clever
investigators
i
had
another
queer
experience
when
i
went
to
meet
susan
penny
related
did
you
ever
hear
of
a
policeman
by
the
name
of
jerome
davis
yes
why
briefly
penny
told
of
her
meeting
with
the
officer
and
his
daughter
i
ca
comprehend
why
betty
tried
to
prevent
her
father
from
writing
out
a
report
of
the
theft
dad
if
such
information
leaked
out
it
might
cost
him
his
position
on
the
force
i
can
readily
understand
that
nichols
returned
jerome
davis
is
in
a
bad
spot
already
just
how
do
you
mean
in
the
first
place
he
has
never
stooped
to
play
politics
some
of
his
superiors
dislike
him
on
that
account
although
until
recently
they
never
questioned
his
honesty
has
anything
ever
been
proven
against
him
no
but
he
has
been
subjected
to
severe
criticism
because
so
many
auto
accessory
thefts
have
occurred
in
his
district
the
situation
gives
his
enemies
a
fine
opportunity
to
shoot
at
him
i
suppose
that
explains
why
betty
did
want
him
to
report
another
theft
she
was
afraid
it
might
cost
him
his
job
that
might
be
the
reason
it
wo
be
fair
if
they
discharge
him
on
account
of
something
he
ca
prevent
life
is
always
fair
penny
what
do
you
think
about
jerome
davis
dad
is
it
your
opinion
that
he
is
honest
yes
i
think
he
is
nichols
abruptly
arose
what
you
have
told
me
is
very
interesting
penny
i
believe
i
call
davis
to
the
house
and
have
a
talk
with
him
he
should
be
off
duty
soon
telephoning
the
davis
home
the
detective
left
a
message
that
the
policeman
was
to
call
back
at
his
earliest
convenience
it
too
late
to
get
him
here
tonight
nichols
remarked
to
his
daughter
if
he
does
telephone
i
ask
him
to
come
to
my
office
then
i
wo
hear
what
he
has
to
say
penny
complained
i
afraid
you
would
anyway
my
dear
davis
would
never
talk
freely
if
you
were
present
at
the
interview
i
suppose
not
if
he
knew
it
but
i
might
hide
in
the
closet
that
would
be
a
trifle
too
theatrical
for
my
taste
penny
the
doorbell
rang
sharply
gallup
came
from
another
room
to
answer
it
a
moment
later
she
returned
to
the
study
where
nichols
and
penny
were
sitting
davis
to
see
you
she
told
the
detective
davis
strange
he
did
telephone
before
coming
at
such
a
late
hour
but
of
course
i
see
him
reluctantly
penny
arose
i
suppose
i
have
to
go
no
wait
you
really
want
to
hear
the
interview
i
most
certainly
do
you
earned
the
right
nichols
smiled
sit
over
there
in
the
wing
chair
deftly
he
turned
it
so
that
the
tall
back
faced
the
door
as
penny
sat
down
he
placed
a
book
in
her
hands
and
advised
her
to
curl
her
feet
up
under
her
as
she
often
did
when
she
read
in
such
a
position
she
was
completely
screened
from
the
gaze
of
the
caller
as
he
entered
the
room
no
sooner
had
penny
settled
herself
comfortably
than
gallup
ushered
the
officer
into
the
study
she
then
quietly
withdrew
have
a
chair
nichols
invited
cordially
he
offered
one
which
would
not
reveal
penny
hiding
place
my
daughter
told
me
you
had
telephoned
jerome
davis
began
a
trifle
uneasily
i
thought
i
might
as
well
walk
on
over
and
see
you
i
hope
i
did
come
too
late
not
at
all
i
seldom
retire
before
midnight
davis
i
suppose
you
wonder
why
i
wanted
to
talk
with
you
a
grim
look
had
come
over
the
officer
face
i
judge
it
about
the
stolen
wheel
and
generator
i
met
your
daughter
this
evening
so
she
told
me
however
what
i
really
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
was
the
molberg
gang
the
officer
offered
no
response
i
do
need
to
tell
you
that
they
are
at
the
bottom
of
this
recent
outburst
of
thievery
the
detective
went
on
eyeing
his
caller
shrewdly
unless
they
captured
soon
you
be
in
a
bad
spot
davis
i
in
one
now
i
always
tried
to
be
honest
and
do
my
duty
as
i
saw
it
because
of
that
i
probably
end
up
without
a
job
not
if
you
team
along
with
me
and
help
me
to
capture
this
gang
say
frankly
that
since
i
took
this
case
for
the
insurance
company
i
have
had
much
cooperation
from
the
police
i
be
glad
to
help
you
all
i
can
nichols
but
i
must
act
cautiously
you
mean
for
fear
of
antagonizing
your
superiors
yes
that
the
chief
reason
jerome
davis
admitted
hesitatingly
have
you
another
nichols
probed
it
this
way
the
officer
informed
growing
confidential
the
commissioner
seems
to
think
that
i
sold
out
to
rap
molberg
at
least
he
appears
to
suspect
that
i
serve
as
a
stool
pigeon
for
the
gang
and
tip
them
off
as
to
the
best
time
to
pull
a
job
i
been
demoted
twice
a
man
would
have
resigned
long
ago
unless
he
wanted
to
prove
the
truth
nichols
suggested
softly
that
it
the
officer
agreed
i
mean
to
hang
on
until
i
fired
from
the
force
i
been
unlucky
because
so
many
jobs
have
been
pulled
in
my
district
i
working
on
the
case
when
i
off
duty
and
one
of
these
days
i
may
get
a
break
you
spoke
of
working
cautiously
are
you
afraid
to
have
your
superiors
know
what
you
are
about
not
exactly
you
see
nichols
lately
i
been
running
down
a
few
tips
regarding
the
whereabouts
of
rap
molberg
some
of
his
henchmen
have
given
me
a
polite
warning
to
mind
my
own
affairs
their
threats
have
terrified
my
daughter
and
my
son
jimmie
then
you
do
feel
that
you
can
push
the
search
the
detective
inquired
pointedly
i
intend
to
go
on
just
as
i
have
jerome
davis
maintained
firmly
i
expect
to
do
everything
in
my
power
to
capture
rap
molberg
good
nichols
exclaimed
i
am
satisfied
that
you
are
the
sort
of
man
i
can
use
if
you
will
work
secretly
with
my
investigators
i
am
confident
we
shall
produce
results
i
be
glad
to
cooperate
in
every
way
i
can
the
officer
promised
they
shook
hands
to
seal
the
agreement
jerome
davis
turned
to
leave
thank
you
for
coming
here
tonight
the
detective
said
as
he
escorted
the
officer
to
the
door
you
will
receive
instructions
from
me
within
a
short
while
a
day
or
two
at
the
latest
after
the
door
had
closed
behind
the
caller
penny
arose
from
her
chair
did
you
enjoy
the
interview
her
father
asked
smiling
it
was
vastly
exciting
i
thought
surely
i
be
seen
davis
was
too
engrossed
in
our
talk
to
be
very
observing
i
do
wonder
that
betty
davis
worries
about
her
father
i
heard
him
say
that
he
had
been
threatened
by
the
molberg
gang
yes
davis
is
in
an
awkward
situation
however
he
seems
to
be
a
man
of
courage
i
can
use
him
i
be
glad
when
you
through
with
this
case
penny
sighed
worried
sick
for
fear
something
may
happen
to
you
all
these
threats
forget
them
nichols
advised
i
received
plenty
of
them
before
this
and
i
still
alive
but
rap
molberg
forget
him
too
the
detective
smiled
unless
you
do
i
be
sorry
i
ever
told
you
about
the
case
run
along
to
bed
now
and
pleasant
dreams
nightmares
to
you
penny
retorted
she
slowly
mounted
the
stairs
and
disappeared
into
her
own
room
chapter
viii
a
revealing
clue
for
the
next
few
days
penny
saw
very
little
of
her
father
he
left
the
house
early
in
the
morning
and
often
did
not
return
at
night
until
after
she
had
retired
meals
became
something
of
an
ordeal
for
either
nichols
buried
himself
in
a
newspaper
or
allowed
the
conversation
to
lapse
you
as
talkative
as
the
sphinx
penny
accused
is
the
case
going
badly
not
to
my
knowledge
is
it
going
well
then
not
especially
have
you
found
any
clue
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
rap
molberg
not
yet
you
impossible
penny
cried
furiously
it
no
use
trying
to
learn
a
thing
from
you
unless
you
in
exactly
the
right
mood
in
desperation
she
sought
solace
in
the
companionship
of
her
chum
susan
they
attended
a
great
many
moving
picture
shows
and
developed
an
enviable
tan
by
swimming
outdoors
and
playing
tennis
for
hours
at
a
time
although
penny
was
permitted
complete
freedom
nichols
had
warned
her
to
use
caution
whenever
she
left
the
house
at
night
on
more
than
one
occasion
in
going
downtown
or
to
the
home
of
a
friend
she
half
suspected
that
she
was
being
followed
she
refrained
from
mentioning
her
fear
to
nichols
lest
he
curtail
her
freedom
but
she
became
more
alert
and
watchful
one
afternoon
while
penny
was
mowing
the
yard
susan
drove
up
in
her
coupé
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
used
it
since
the
unfortunate
night
of
the
theft
she
hailed
penny
joyously
the
old
bus
is
traveling
again
it
has
a
new
generator
and
a
fine
new
wheel
penny
inspected
the
new
purchases
see
anything
wrong
with
the
wheel
susan
demanded
not
a
thing
why
i
bought
it
for
about
half
the
regular
price
i
was
a
little
afraid
i
might
have
been
gipped
penny
examined
the
spare
wheel
more
critically
it
looks
exactly
like
the
one
dad
bought
me
some
time
ago
for
nine
in
fact
i
think
it
was
the
same
tire
the
one
that
was
stolen
from
me
if
i
did
know
better
i
only
paid
four
dollars
susan
informed
proudly
was
it
a
bargain
it
looks
like
it
where
did
you
buy
the
tire
oh
at
a
little
place
on
south
lake
street
i
do
remember
the
name
south
lake
is
such
a
good
location
penny
said
thoughtfully
heard
father
say
that
a
great
many
disreputable
firms
operate
there
i
know
once
he
traced
stolen
furniture
to
a
dealer
on
that
street
i
hope
i
did
buy
a
stolen
wheel
susan
declared
was
that
what
you
had
in
mind
penny
i
thought
of
it
right
off
but
i
have
any
reason
for
saying
it
for
all
i
know
your
tire
may
be
a
legitimate
bargain
i
wish
there
was
some
way
of
finding
out
for
certain
susan
said
anxiously
let
look
for
the
serial
number
the
wheel
should
have
one
penny
moved
closer
to
inspect
the
new
purchase
the
number
is
here
all
right
she
acknowledged
then
the
tire
was
stolen
susan
said
in
relief
penny
shook
her
head
i
not
so
sure
of
that
sue
it
looks
to
me
as
if
these
numbers
have
been
changed
wait
a
minute
she
darted
into
the
house
returning
with
her
father
magnifying
glass
using
it
to
study
the
figures
upon
the
wheel
the
girls
could
plainly
see
that
the
numbers
had
been
altered
to
think
i
buy
a
stolen
wheel
susan
exclaimed
indignantly
going
right
back
and
tell
that
dealer
a
thing
or
two
you
ca
very
well
do
that
we
would
be
in
no
position
to
prove
anything
i
suppose
you
right
susan
admitted
i
like
to
see
the
establishment
where
you
bought
the
tire
penny
said
after
a
moment
pause
could
you
point
it
out
to
me
yes
i
take
you
there
now
if
you
like
penny
rolled
the
lawn
mower
into
the
garage
and
climbed
into
the
coupé
beside
her
chum
how
do
you
like
your
car
by
this
time
she
inquired
as
they
drove
toward
south
lake
street
not
so
well
it
starts
hard
and
has
a
funny
sound
in
the
engine
in
a
few
days
i
mean
to
take
it
back
to
the
brunner
garage
for
a
complete
overhaul
south
lake
street
was
located
in
the
poorer
section
of
belton
city
the
neighborhood
was
noted
for
its
stores
and
it
was
said
that
sooner
or
later
stolen
merchandise
found
its
way
into
the
crowded
little
shops
which
lined
the
narrow
thoroughfare
often
wares
were
piled
upon
the
sidewalks
to
attract
an
unwary
buyer
stoves
cheap
tables
and
all
manner
of
hardware
rubbed
elbows
with
clever
brass
jugs
imported
vases
and
oriental
rugs
presently
susan
halted
her
car
in
front
of
a
tire
shop
which
was
located
at
the
outskirts
of
second
hand
row
this
is
the
place
she
announced
the
owner
of
the
shop
a
short
squat
little
man
with
beady
black
eyes
stood
at
the
window
he
eyed
the
girls
sharply
shall
we
go
in
susan
asked
let
but
we
must
act
as
if
we
suspect
anything
assuming
a
casual
attitude
they
sauntered
into
the
shop
the
dealer
recognized
susan
instantly
on
her
first
visit
he
had
been
a
trifle
too
cordial
but
now
he
regarded
her
shrewdly
something
he
inquired
my
friend
wishes
to
buy
a
new
wheel
susan
informed
she
like
to
see
one
like
i
bought
yesterday
again
the
dealer
cast
a
sharp
glance
at
penny
have
i
seen
you
in
here
before
he
asked
penny
shook
her
head
no
this
is
the
first
time
i
ever
came
into
your
store
i
seen
you
somewhere
the
man
muttered
now
i
know
christopher
nichols
daughter
he
pronounced
the
name
of
the
detective
with
a
slight
sneer
yes
i
am
penny
acknowledged
reluctantly
but
i
sure
i
never
seen
you
before
that
quite
likely
then
how
did
you
know
me
that
my
business
the
dealer
retorted
shortly
i
am
sorry
but
i
ca
do
business
with
you
good
day
penny
stood
her
ground
have
you
any
tires
for
sale
not
for
you
i
have
you
a
snooper
just
like
your
father
get
out
of
here
penny
would
have
carried
the
argument
further
but
susan
tugged
at
her
sleeve
they
hastily
left
the
shop
as
they
drove
away
they
saw
the
dealer
standing
at
the
plate
glass
window
watching
such
a
horrible
man
susan
gasped
i
was
actually
afraid
of
him
what
made
him
act
like
that
i
think
he
must
have
guessed
why
we
came
penny
told
her
as
a
sleuth
i
seem
to
be
a
walking
advertisement
of
my
calling
he
recognized
you
the
minute
you
stepped
into
the
store
did
that
strike
you
as
queer
yes
it
did
susan
i
almost
certain
that
man
is
dealing
in
stolen
tires
he
probably
afraid
of
the
law
it
to
his
advantage
to
recognize
plain
clothesmen
and
persons
who
might
cause
him
trouble
i
imagine
i
been
seen
with
my
father
i
should
think
the
police
could
arrest
him
it
is
as
easy
as
one
might
believe
susan
if
a
fence
is
caught
with
stolen
merchandise
he
claims
to
have
purchased
it
in
good
faith
actually
he
has
taken
it
off
the
hands
of
some
thief
an
arrest
is
hard
to
make
then
there
nothing
we
can
do
i
do
know
i
ask
father
when
he
comes
home
tonight
i
think
a
fence
is
even
more
contemptible
than
a
thief
susan
said
scornfully
i
give
anything
if
i
had
bought
that
tire
i
glad
you
did
penny
smiled
for
the
clue
we
gained
may
prove
useful
to
father
the
girls
were
relieved
when
they
reached
the
end
of
south
lake
and
turned
into
a
more
pleasant
street
driving
toward
their
homes
they
relapsed
into
a
long
silence
each
absorbed
in
her
own
thoughts
there
were
occasions
when
the
two
friends
talked
frantically
for
hours
there
were
other
times
when
they
would
speak
scarcely
a
word
yet
enjoy
perfect
understanding
penny
had
slumped
in
her
seat
suddenly
she
straightened
her
eyes
riveted
upon
a
pedestrian
who
was
crossing
the
street
in
front
of
the
coupé
susan
is
that
jerry
barrows
she
demanded
excitedly
the
car
swerved
wildly
as
susan
turned
to
look
it
is
she
exclaimed
stop
the
car
penny
pleaded
i
want
to
talk
with
him
susan
brought
the
coupé
to
a
halt
at
the
curbing
penny
sprang
out
jerry
barrows
she
called
the
boy
wheeled
and
saw
her
he
hesitated
an
instant
then
turned
and
ran
chapter
ix
a
trap
wait
i
want
to
talk
with
you
penny
called
the
boy
paid
no
heed
as
she
ran
after
him
he
darted
into
the
nearest
alley
provoked
penny
hastened
back
to
the
car
where
susan
was
waiting
let
try
to
catch
him
she
proposed
springing
in
beside
her
chum
susan
turned
the
coupé
in
the
narrow
street
and
drove
into
the
alley
they
could
see
the
boy
only
a
short
distance
ahead
we
overtake
him
penny
cried
jubilantly
aware
that
he
was
being
pursued
the
boy
ran
faster
then
noticing
an
opening
between
two
buildings
he
squeezed
through
it
and
was
lost
to
view
penny
tried
to
follow
afoot
but
soon
gave
it
up
she
returned
to
the
coupé
disheartened
he
eluded
us
this
time
sue
i
suppose
that
boy
thought
i
meant
to
have
him
arrested
actually
i
only
wanted
to
question
him
for
some
minutes
the
girls
cruised
around
the
block
hoping
to
sight
jerry
barrows
again
although
they
kept
close
watch
of
the
alleys
he
did
not
reappear
did
you
notice
anything
peculiar
about
that
boy
appearance
penny
inquired
as
they
turned
toward
home
no
why
he
was
dressed
much
better
than
on
that
night
when
we
caught
him
in
our
garage
he
does
look
as
if
he
had
ever
had
much
hard
luck
i
imagine
his
entire
story
was
a
lie
susan
declared
he
keep
his
promise
to
call
at
your
father
office
and
now
he
runs
like
a
coward
when
we
try
to
talk
with
him
i
do
see
how
i
was
taken
in
so
easily
penny
confessed
ruefully
i
could
help
liking
the
boy
i
hoped
he
would
turn
over
a
new
leaf
alighting
at
the
nichols
home
she
invited
her
chum
to
remain
for
dinner
i
ca
tonight
susan
told
her
regretfully
we
having
guests
i
suppose
i
have
to
eat
alone
then
no
use
expecting
dad
home
in
this
she
was
mistaken
entering
the
house
she
discovered
nichols
submerged
in
his
favorite
easy
chair
i
did
look
for
you
home
so
early
dad
nor
did
i
expect
to
make
it
when
i
left
the
house
this
morning
however
i
must
return
to
the
office
immediately
after
dinner
is
it
so
very
important
penny
demanded
her
father
smiled
lonesome
not
exactly
only
the
evenings
seem
so
long
why
do
you
go
to
a
moving
picture
show
i
seen
every
good
one
in
town
besides
i
tired
of
movies
i
realize
i
am
being
a
very
poor
father
nichols
acknowledged
reaching
over
to
squeeze
her
hand
you
might
come
back
to
the
office
with
me
i
like
that
penny
said
instantly
it
will
be
very
dull
her
father
warned
directly
after
dinner
they
motored
to
nichols
new
office
opposite
the
brunner
garage
since
the
detective
expected
to
occupy
it
only
a
few
weeks
at
the
most
it
was
equipped
with
the
barest
of
necessities
there
was
a
battered
desk
three
chairs
and
two
telephones
nothing
more
what
in
the
world
do
you
do
here
penny
questioned
mostly
sit
and
wait
the
detective
admitted
i
receive
reports
from
some
of
my
men
here
during
the
day
i
watch
the
street
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
he
indicated
a
powerful
field
glass
which
lay
upon
the
desk
penny
picked
it
up
training
it
upon
the
brunner
garage
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
why
it
brings
everything
remarkably
close
do
you
sit
here
at
the
window
and
watch
for
the
auto
thieves
something
like
that
we
set
a
trap
a
trap
penny
was
all
interest
yes
we
planted
several
expensive
new
cars
in
key
positions
on
the
street
our
men
are
secretly
watching
them
of
course
we
hope
that
the
auto
thieves
will
select
one
of
our
models
to
strip
it
must
be
tedious
waiting
it
is
but
if
we
catch
the
gang
our
patience
will
have
been
rewarded
but
what
of
rap
molberg
penny
questioned
doubtfully
surely
he
must
delegate
the
actual
thievery
to
others
i
not
so
sure
nichols
said
slowly
it
would
surprise
me
to
learn
that
molberg
acts
upon
orders
from
someone
higher
up
however
that
may
be
if
we
capture
some
of
the
lesser
fry
they
can
be
made
to
talk
the
detective
busied
himself
at
his
desk
for
a
time
penny
amused
herself
by
watching
pedestrians
through
the
field
glass
growing
tired
of
that
she
buried
herself
in
a
magazine
it
was
not
very
interesting
by
nine
she
was
thoroughly
bored
i
think
i
go
home
she
announced
i
do
believe
anything
exciting
will
happen
tonight
so
that
why
you
came
her
father
chided
and
i
thought
it
was
because
you
craved
my
company
i
did
but
this
bare
office
is
too
depressing
then
i
excuse
you
nichols
smiled
take
a
taxi
home
if
you
like
no
i
think
i
walk
it
was
a
pleasant
mellow
evening
and
penny
was
in
the
mood
for
a
long
stroll
she
chose
a
roundabout
route
home
she
was
crossing
a
street
thinking
of
nothing
in
particular
when
an
automobile
without
headlights
shot
past
her
at
a
high
rate
of
speed
frightened
penny
sprang
backwards
the
nerve
of
that
driver
she
thought
he
missed
me
by
inches
she
watched
the
car
swerve
around
a
corner
and
race
up
a
street
why
this
is
the
very
place
where
i
lost
track
of
rap
molberg
she
told
herself
she
rushed
to
the
corner
her
fascinated
gaze
followed
the
retreating
automobile
it
tore
madly
to
the
end
of
the
street
where
it
abruptly
halted
penny
lost
sight
of
it
for
an
instant
then
to
her
surprise
the
headlights
were
flashed
on
in
the
reflected
light
she
saw
the
tall
walls
of
a
large
manufacturing
plant
the
beam
was
turned
off
again
darkness
swallowed
up
the
car
while
she
was
straining
to
see
penny
heard
the
shrill
blast
of
a
warning
siren
from
far
up
the
street
the
next
instant
a
police
radio
cruiser
shot
past
with
a
loud
screaming
of
brakes
the
police
car
came
to
a
stop
not
far
from
penny
did
you
see
an
automobile
without
headlights
come
this
way
the
driver
asked
tersely
penny
was
only
too
glad
to
offer
information
it
turned
into
this
she
began
the
officers
did
not
wait
to
hear
more
with
a
roar
the
cruiser
was
off
again
it
reached
the
end
of
the
street
and
halted
because
it
could
go
no
farther
penny
bent
upon
missing
nothing
followed
as
fast
as
she
could
by
the
time
she
reached
the
radio
cruiser
one
of
the
officers
had
alighted
he
was
looking
carefully
about
sighting
penny
he
walked
over
to
her
say
you
i
thought
you
told
us
that
car
came
this
way
it
did
penny
maintained
staunchly
i
saw
it
go
to
the
very
end
of
this
street
the
lights
flashed
on
for
an
instant
then
the
car
seemed
to
vanish
i
think
it
must
have
gone
into
that
building
she
indicated
the
hamilton
manufacturing
plant
the
officer
surveyed
it
briefly
do
kid
me
he
snapped
only
a
houdini
ever
went
through
solid
walls
he
climbed
back
into
the
police
car
saying
gruffly
to
the
driver
get
going
philips
it
was
a
wrong
steer
we
must
have
missed
that
car
at
the
turn
penny
waited
until
the
cruiser
disappeared
around
the
corner
then
she
crossed
the
street
and
stood
staring
meditatively
at
the
tall
walls
of
the
hamilton
plant
there
was
no
doorway
leading
into
the
building
it
uncanny
she
murmured
yet
i
know
very
well
that
car
went
in
there
some
way
the
building
was
entirely
dark
there
were
no
windows
on
the
street
side
only
a
vast
expanse
of
unbroken
wall
it
too
dark
to
see
anything
tonight
penny
decided
after
a
brief
hesitation
tomorrow
i
come
back
and
perhaps
make
a
few
interesting
discoveries
and
with
that
resolution
she
turned
and
walked
rapidly
toward
home
chapter
x
the
vanishing
car
penny
fully
intended
to
tell
her
father
of
her
experience
but
she
retired
before
he
came
home
she
overslept
the
next
morning
when
she
descended
to
the
breakfast
room
at
nine
gallup
told
her
that
the
detective
had
been
gone
for
nearly
an
hour
your
father
was
in
a
very
good
mood
this
morning
the
housekeeper
informed
as
she
served
penny
with
a
steaming
hot
waffle
he
complained
about
the
coffee
when
he
does
that
it
always
because
something
gone
wrong
with
his
work
you
must
mind
dad
penny
smiled
we
could
get
along
without
you
gallup
sniffed
i
do
the
best
i
can
the
coffee
does
taste
all
right
does
it
it
perfect
when
your
father
working
on
a
hard
case
he
always
likes
it
strong
as
lye
the
housekeeper
complained
but
i
know
he
was
worried
about
something
this
morning
what
makes
you
think
so
i
heard
him
muttering
to
himself
something
about
the
stupidity
of
the
police
it
seems
they
let
some
crook
get
away
last
night
after
your
father
had
laid
careful
plans
to
catch
him
not
rap
molberg
i
think
that
was
the
name
nichols
did
tell
me
anything
i
just
heard
him
talking
it
over
with
himself
it
the
only
person
he
will
discuss
his
business
with
penny
chuckled
after
gallup
had
gone
back
into
the
kitchen
she
mulled
over
the
information
which
the
housekeeper
had
given
her
it
struck
her
as
probable
that
the
car
which
she
had
seen
vanish
down
the
street
had
been
driven
by
rap
molberg
or
one
of
his
confederates
i
wish
i
could
have
talked
with
dad
about
it
before
he
left
the
house
she
thought
penny
had
not
forgotten
her
resolution
to
visit
the
hamilton
plant
by
daylight
as
soon
as
she
had
helped
gallup
with
the
dishes
she
left
the
house
walking
directly
to
the
scene
of
the
previous
adventure
the
street
was
deserted
no
one
questioned
her
actions
as
she
made
a
careful
inspection
of
the
old
building
which
had
housed
the
hamilton
manufacturing
company
until
its
failure
she
examined
the
walls
inch
by
inch
but
although
she
was
convinced
it
was
there
she
could
find
no
hidden
entrance
regardless
of
her
failure
to
find
evidence
penny
was
unwilling
to
give
up
her
original
theory
she
remained
unshaken
in
her
belief
that
the
mysterious
automobile
had
disappeared
into
the
hamilton
building
there
no
other
place
it
could
have
gone
she
reasoned
i
talk
it
over
with
dad
and
see
what
he
thinks
when
she
stopped
at
his
office
nichols
was
not
there
nor
could
miss
arrow
tell
her
when
he
might
return
the
detective
did
not
come
home
for
luncheon
and
late
in
the
afternoon
telephoned
to
say
that
he
would
take
dinner
downtown
rather
than
spend
an
evening
alone
penny
called
susan
arranging
that
they
should
go
to
the
library
together
the
girls
spent
an
hour
in
the
reading
room
but
for
some
reason
penny
could
not
interest
herself
in
the
magazines
she
kept
turning
through
them
and
laying
them
aside
she
felt
unusually
restless
presently
an
electrical
magazine
attracted
her
attention
she
glanced
over
it
carelessly
until
she
came
to
a
particular
article
which
dealt
with
cells
and
the
clever
purposes
for
which
they
were
used
why
these
are
almost
human
she
commented
in
an
undertone
to
susan
they
turn
lights
on
and
off
cook
meals
and
open
doors
when
a
beam
of
light
strikes
the
cell
i
heard
of
them
before
susan
interrupted
in
a
tone
which
clearly
implied
that
she
was
not
in
the
least
interested
penny
took
the
hint
and
dropped
the
subject
but
she
became
absorbed
in
the
article
when
she
closed
the
magazine
a
half
hour
later
her
face
was
flushed
with
excitement
susan
let
get
away
from
here
she
proposed
in
a
whisper
just
had
an
inspiration
grumbling
a
little
at
being
forced
to
leave
a
fascinating
story
before
she
had
finished
it
susan
followed
her
friend
from
the
building
what
about
this
inspiration
of
yours
she
demanded
as
they
walked
to
penny
parked
roadster
it
this
way
susan
i
knew
there
was
a
logical
explanation
for
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
that
car
rap
molberg
was
driving
let
go
over
to
the
hamilton
factory
this
minute
and
test
out
my
new
theory
you
may
know
what
you
talking
about
but
i
sure
i
do
penny
nichols
that
because
you
would
let
me
tell
you
about
that
article
i
was
reading
penny
laughed
but
i
explain
everything
as
we
go
along
without
pausing
to
consider
that
it
might
not
be
safe
to
investigate
the
abandoned
manufacturing
plant
at
such
a
late
hour
the
girls
drove
directly
into
the
hilly
section
of
belton
city
penny
turned
into
the
familiar
street
and
was
relieved
to
find
no
sign
of
other
vehicles
she
halted
her
roadster
at
the
very
end
of
the
pavement
in
such
a
position
that
the
bright
headlights
played
upon
the
massive
walls
of
the
hamilton
building
it
must
be
located
higher
up
penny
murmured
to
herself
what
is
susan
demanded
i
do
see
what
you
about
anyway
without
answering
penny
directed
the
beam
of
her
spotlight
upon
the
stone
structure
inch
by
inch
she
moved
it
systematically
over
the
high
wall
perhaps
it
only
a
silly
idea
she
acknowledged
at
last
but
i
believe
that
somewhere
in
the
wall
there
must
be
a
secret
door
one
mechanically
operated
no
doubt
the
outline
of
the
opening
is
disguised
by
the
many
irregular
cracks
in
the
masonry
if
you
looking
for
a
secret
opening
why
not
come
in
the
daytime
when
you
can
see
much
better
i
been
here
in
the
daytime
and
the
door
ca
be
detected
at
least
not
by
the
eye
i
hoping
to
have
better
luck
this
time
i
ca
for
the
life
of
me
see
how
susan
began
but
ended
with
a
startled
gasp
a
portion
of
the
massive
wall
was
slowly
moving
backward
just
as
i
thought
penny
chuckled
in
delight
now
we
know
how
rap
molberg
escaped
from
the
police
the
other
night
in
fascination
the
girls
watched
the
widening
gap
in
the
wall
soon
it
was
large
enough
for
an
automobile
to
easily
drive
through
into
the
empty
building
how
did
you
open
it
susan
asked
in
awe
the
beam
of
my
spotlight
struck
a
cell
which
was
secreted
near
the
eaves
penny
explained
briefly
you
should
have
read
about
it
at
the
library
i
wish
i
had
now
it
almost
uncanny
let
drive
in
and
have
a
look
at
the
inside
penny
suggested
daringly
wo
it
be
dangerous
susan
demurred
the
place
seems
to
be
deserted
but
probably
it
would
be
wiser
if
you
waited
here
and
i
went
in
alone
no
if
you
going
to
risk
it
so
am
i
then
here
goes
penny
said
she
drove
the
roadster
through
the
opening
into
what
appeared
to
be
an
empty
room
curiously
the
girls
glanced
about
suddenly
susan
uttered
a
stifled
scream
the
door
it
closing
already
the
opening
had
narrowed
to
a
mere
slit
it
was
too
late
to
retreat
do
lose
your
nerve
penny
advised
although
her
own
heart
was
beating
at
a
furious
rate
we
find
some
way
to
open
that
door
someone
may
have
seen
us
drive
in
and
closed
it
deliberately
i
do
think
so
susan
it
must
have
closed
automatically
anyway
we
prisoners
inside
this
horrible
place
we
starve
to
death
before
anyone
will
suspect
we
here
i
got
you
into
this
and
i
get
you
out
penny
announced
firmly
there
must
be
some
button
or
lever
that
opens
the
door
from
the
inside
although
the
headlights
of
the
roadster
illuminated
a
portion
of
the
large
room
many
of
the
corners
and
crannies
remained
dark
taking
her
flashlight
from
the
pocket
of
the
car
penny
moved
cautiously
about
searching
for
some
means
of
escape
susan
remained
huddled
in
her
seat
too
terrified
to
move
penny
examined
the
door
but
it
would
not
budge
when
she
threw
her
weight
against
it
she
could
find
no
lock
or
catch
there
were
several
windows
high
overhead
but
without
a
ladder
she
could
not
hope
to
reach
them
she
was
growing
more
disturbed
than
she
cared
to
admit
when
susan
called
to
her
penny
i
think
there
some
sort
of
lever
over
here
by
the
car
penny
flashed
her
beam
in
that
direction
and
was
relieved
to
see
that
her
chum
was
right
it
must
operate
the
door
susan
we
should
be
out
of
here
in
a
jiffy
confidently
she
grasped
the
long
handle
and
pulled
with
all
her
strength
upon
the
iron
lever
from
below
came
the
low
rumble
of
moving
machinery
penny
and
susan
riveted
their
eyes
hopefully
upon
the
door
it
did
not
open
instead
a
square
of
floor
upon
which
the
roadster
was
resting
slowly
began
to
sink
uttering
a
frightened
scream
susan
tried
to
open
the
car
door
save
me
she
cried
frantically
penny
leaped
nimbly
down
upon
the
running
board
it
all
right
she
laughed
shakily
we
only
descending
in
an
elevator
we
be
killed
before
we
ever
get
out
of
this
dreadful
place
the
elevator
struck
the
lower
floor
with
a
gentle
thud
penny
then
climbed
into
the
car
and
drove
it
a
few
feet
forward
relieved
of
its
weight
the
platform
slowly
rose
again
until
it
had
resumed
its
former
position
we
worse
off
now
than
we
were
before
susan
moaned
i
think
this
must
be
the
way
out
penny
comforted
she
indicated
a
opening
directly
ahead
susan
who
had
been
looking
in
the
opposite
direction
had
noticed
a
small
room
which
appeared
to
be
an
office
she
called
her
chum
attention
to
it
together
they
cautiously
peered
inside
save
for
a
battered
desk
and
several
chairs
the
tiny
room
was
empty
cigarette
ashes
and
old
papers
were
scattered
over
the
floor
giving
evidence
that
the
office
had
been
used
recently
penny
tried
the
desk
and
found
it
locked
she
picked
up
a
few
scraps
of
paper
from
the
floor
they
were
without
interest
a
folded
newspaper
lying
upon
one
of
the
chairs
drew
her
attention
opening
it
she
noticed
that
an
article
on
the
front
page
had
been
underscored
with
pencil
lines
the
headline
read
auto
accessory
thefts
on
steady
increase
here
the
story
hinted
that
belton
city
police
had
been
unable
to
cope
with
the
situation
and
that
local
insurance
companies
long
harassed
by
an
organized
gang
had
turned
the
case
over
to
private
detectives
above
the
latter
statement
someone
had
written
the
name
of
christopher
nichols
in
pencil
penny
carefully
folded
the
newspaper
replacing
it
upon
the
chair
exactly
as
she
had
found
it
let
get
away
from
here
before
we
caught
she
urged
i
suspect
we
in
a
molberg
hideout
nothing
would
please
me
better
than
to
leave
this
place
susan
retorted
grimly
just
lead
me
to
an
exit
i
think
the
tunnel
probably
will
take
us
out
come
on
let
see
returning
to
the
roadster
the
dark
passage
seemed
forbiddingly
dangerous
carefully
examining
the
concrete
floor
penny
discovered
tire
patterns
in
the
dirt
other
cars
had
used
the
tunnel
with
the
engine
at
idling
speed
they
drove
into
it
the
tunnel
led
downward
at
such
a
steep
angle
that
soon
penny
was
forced
to
use
her
brakes
to
keep
from
going
too
fast
where
will
this
thing
end
susan
asked
even
as
she
spoke
they
reached
level
ground
an
ordinary
double
garage
door
barred
the
way
susan
sprang
out
to
open
it
why
we
in
an
empty
garage
she
announced
as
she
swung
back
the
door
penny
drove
the
roadster
through
and
waited
until
susan
had
closed
the
door
behind
her
through
a
plateglass
window
the
girls
could
now
see
the
street
but
it
took
them
some
time
to
locate
another
unlocked
door
which
permitted
them
to
escape
once
safely
out
of
the
building
they
pulled
up
at
the
side
of
the
road
to
take
note
of
their
surroundings
at
first
they
could
not
imagine
where
they
were
why
this
must
be
arlington
avenue
penny
decided
we
several
hundred
feet
lower
than
we
were
when
we
left
that
street
on
the
hilltop
what
a
clever
means
for
a
crook
to
escape
a
police
chase
yes
is
it
i
almost
certain
the
place
has
been
used
by
the
molberg
gang
then
we
ca
get
away
from
here
too
quick
susan
declared
nervously
penny
laughed
we
safe
enough
now
besides
i
imagine
this
escape
is
never
used
except
in
an
emergency
probably
only
when
the
police
are
hot
on
the
trail
susan
glanced
at
her
watch
it
after
ten
and
i
promised
mother
i
be
back
at
nine
i
take
you
straight
home
penny
promised
i
do
suppose
i
need
to
mention
it
but
i
think
we
should
tell
anyone
about
what
we
discovered
tonight
at
least
not
until
the
police
have
been
notified
of
course
not
susan
agreed
instantly
why
do
you
have
your
father
make
the
report
for
us
i
like
to
handle
it
that
way
if
you
do
mind
penny
said
eagerly
then
let
leave
it
that
way
aside
from
nichols
we
not
tell
a
soul
about
our
discovery
tonight
a
few
minutes
later
the
girls
took
leave
of
each
other
penny
continued
alone
toward
her
own
home
turning
a
corner
in
one
of
the
outlying
neighborhood
business
sections
she
noticed
a
girl
in
blue
hurrying
along
the
street
recognizing
betty
davis
penny
halted
her
roadster
at
the
curbing
the
girl
did
not
notice
for
she
had
paused
to
stare
into
the
window
of
a
café
a
group
of
young
men
could
be
seen
within
laughing
and
talking
it
was
not
the
type
of
place
frequented
by
women
and
penny
was
astonished
when
the
girl
started
to
open
the
door
but
with
her
hand
on
the
knob
betty
davis
seemed
to
reconsider
for
she
turned
and
walked
rapidly
away
penny
drew
alongside
in
her
roadster
going
my
way
she
asked
cheerfully
i
be
glad
to
give
you
a
lift
chapter
xi
a
threat
betty
davis
wheeled
quickly
about
she
laughed
to
cover
her
confusion
why
miss
nichols
how
you
startled
me
i
did
mean
to
do
that
penny
smiled
if
you
on
your
way
home
ca
i
take
you
there
in
my
car
the
girl
hesitated
and
involuntarily
her
eyes
wandered
toward
the
café
then
she
stepped
into
the
car
it
very
kind
of
you
to
take
me
home
miss
nichols
i
not
out
alone
this
late
in
the
evening
as
a
rule
but
something
important
came
up
i
searching
for
my
brother
jimmie
yes
how
did
you
know
i
think
your
father
mentioned
his
name
he
did
say
anything
about
betty
broke
off
finishing
with
an
embarrassed
laugh
but
then
i
know
he
did
your
father
only
mentioned
that
he
had
a
son
by
that
name
penny
said
eyeing
her
companion
curiously
jimmie
is
a
good
boy
but
he
caused
father
a
great
deal
of
worry
betty
added
feeling
that
some
explanation
was
required
lately
fallen
in
with
bad
companions
that
is
a
pity
penny
murmured
you
mentioned
that
you
were
looking
for
him
ca
i
help
you
oh
no
betty
told
her
hastily
i
do
think
i
bother
after
all
penny
permitted
the
matter
to
drop
but
she
was
not
mistaken
in
suspecting
that
the
reason
her
companion
had
decided
to
give
up
the
search
was
because
she
already
had
located
her
brother
at
the
café
wo
you
come
in
for
a
few
minutes
betty
urged
when
the
car
stopped
at
her
door
father
is
due
home
until
late
tonight
and
i
all
alone
i
might
stop
a
little
while
penny
agreed
despite
betty
somewhat
queer
actions
she
had
liked
the
girl
from
the
very
first
and
was
eager
to
become
better
acquainted
the
davis
home
was
modestly
furnished
yet
with
excellent
taste
penny
could
not
refrain
from
referring
to
the
clever
color
scheme
which
had
been
carried
out
so
successfully
in
the
living
room
i
glad
you
like
it
betty
smiled
you
see
i
studying
to
be
an
interior
decorator
why
how
interesting
i
attend
night
school
betty
explained
or
rather
i
did
just
now
father
is
a
little
pressed
for
money
so
i
given
it
up
for
a
few
months
i
hope
you
be
able
to
go
on
with
it
again
yes
so
do
i
for
it
the
one
ambition
of
my
life
i
think
after
jimmie
is
a
little
older
it
will
be
easier
just
now
he
at
the
age
where
he
feels
he
must
have
fine
clothes
and
plenty
of
spending
money
perhaps
you
too
indulgent
a
sister
penny
smiled
jimmie
is
only
a
year
younger
than
i
betty
explained
but
since
mother
died
five
years
ago
i
always
felt
responsible
for
him
lately
i
been
terribly
worried
on
account
of
the
company
he
keeps
yes
that
and
other
things
betty
arose
and
nervously
crossed
over
to
the
fireplace
i
do
mean
to
unburden
myself
upon
you
but
lately
jimmie
has
been
doing
wild
things
father
does
half
suspect
the
truth
i
half
sick
with
trying
to
decide
if
i
should
tell
him
or
not
probably
it
would
relieve
your
mind
if
you
did
penny
advised
kindly
yes
but
father
has
always
taken
such
pride
in
jimmie
i
ca
bear
to
hurt
him
perhaps
he
could
bring
your
brother
to
his
senses
i
afraid
it
may
be
almost
too
late
jimmie
is
so
headstrong
he
wo
listen
to
anyone
he
changed
so
much
the
last
few
months
it
seems
to
me
that
your
father
should
know
the
truth
penny
said
quietly
betty
davis
face
had
grown
slightly
pale
i
realize
i
should
tell
him
she
acknowledged
but
i
ca
a
special
reason
why
do
ask
me
to
explain
abruptly
she
tried
to
change
the
subject
saying
lightly
my
brother
is
very
handsome
i
think
would
you
care
to
see
his
photograph
indeed
i
would
penny
returned
politely
she
waited
while
betty
went
into
an
adjoining
room
after
it
as
the
girl
returned
a
car
was
driving
slowly
past
the
house
that
must
be
father
betty
declared
moving
toward
the
window
penny
heard
the
automobile
halt
at
the
curbing
the
next
instant
a
hard
object
crashed
through
the
windowpane
dropping
with
a
thud
at
betty
feet
almost
by
a
miracle
she
had
escaped
being
struck
by
the
flying
splinters
of
glass
penny
sprang
to
her
feet
rushing
to
the
door
she
caught
only
a
fleeting
glimpse
of
the
retreating
car
betty
was
staring
at
a
piece
of
paper
which
lay
upon
the
carpet
it
had
been
wrapped
around
a
small
stone
you
read
it
she
begged
penny
i
afraid
penny
reached
down
and
picked
it
up
the
message
had
been
printed
on
cheap
brown
wrapping
paper
it
bore
the
warning
jerome
davis
this
is
the
last
warning
you
will
receive
from
us
we
give
you
hours
to
change
your
mind
it
a
threat
from
the
molberg
gang
betty
declared
tensely
as
penny
finished
reading
the
message
aloud
oh
i
never
feel
easy
again
until
every
member
of
that
outfit
has
been
placed
behind
bars
what
do
you
think
they
will
do
when
father
defies
them
probably
nothing
penny
comforted
most
anonymous
notes
are
sent
by
cowards
and
the
threats
seldom
carried
out
at
least
dad
regard
them
very
seriously
he
been
threatened
by
the
molberg
gang
too
and
have
they
made
no
attempt
to
harm
him
betty
asked
not
to
my
knowledge
dad
seems
more
than
able
to
look
after
himself
and
i
certain
your
father
knows
how
to
protect
himself
too
he
should
betty
admitted
he
one
of
the
best
marksmen
on
the
police
force
then
i
think
rap
molberg
is
the
one
who
should
be
on
his
guard
penny
smiled
by
making
light
of
the
threatening
note
she
tried
to
relieve
betty
of
anxiety
her
efforts
were
not
very
successful
when
she
left
the
house
a
half
hour
later
the
girl
was
still
excited
and
overwrought
not
until
penny
was
nearly
home
did
it
occur
to
her
that
she
had
forgotten
to
look
at
the
photograph
of
jimmie
davis
oh
well
it
does
matter
she
thought
as
she
drove
the
roadster
into
the
garage
gallup
came
down
the
path
to
meet
her
i
sorry
to
be
so
late
penny
said
quickly
before
the
housekeeper
could
take
her
to
task
a
million
and
one
things
detained
me
home
i
suppose
no
he
is
but
someone
has
been
trying
to
get
you
on
the
telephone
for
the
past
hour
probably
it
was
dad
it
may
have
been
but
it
did
sound
like
his
voice
listen
that
the
phone
now
they
could
hear
the
bell
ringing
inside
the
house
penny
ran
to
answer
it
as
she
took
down
the
receiver
she
was
greeted
by
a
masculine
voice
but
it
was
not
the
detective
who
had
telephoned
is
this
miss
nichols
she
was
asked
yes
penny
returned
quietly
aware
from
the
other
tone
that
she
must
prepare
herself
for
bad
news
do
be
alarmed
miss
nichols
but
your
father
has
been
hurt
oh
badly
we
not
sure
yet
he
is
still
unconscious
can
you
come
at
once
yes
yes
of
course
which
hospital
he
has
been
taken
to
a
private
home
then
tell
me
how
to
get
there
it
wo
be
necessary
a
taxi
has
already
been
sent
for
you
it
should
be
there
by
this
time
i
be
waiting
penny
promised
she
hung
up
the
receiver
and
turned
to
the
housekeeper
who
was
hovering
anxiously
at
her
elbow
dad
been
hurt
she
said
tersely
to
hide
her
emotion
i
do
know
how
badly
for
i
could
learn
the
details
i
must
go
to
him
at
once
oh
you
poor
thing
gallup
swept
the
trembling
girl
into
her
arms
they
clung
to
one
another
for
an
instant
then
penny
resolutely
brushed
away
her
tears
it
probably
is
as
bad
as
we
fear
she
said
hopefully
catching
up
her
pocketbook
from
the
table
she
hurried
out
upon
the
porch
to
wait
for
the
taxicab
chapter
xii
kidnapped
as
a
dark
colored
cab
stopped
in
front
of
the
nichols
residence
penny
ran
to
the
curbing
before
the
driver
could
alight
you
were
sent
here
to
take
me
to
my
father
she
asked
yes
miss
the
driver
kept
his
head
lowered
so
that
penny
could
not
see
his
face
clearly
but
she
was
too
troubled
to
notice
anything
wrong
is
father
badly
hurt
she
questioned
anxiously
i
ca
tell
you
miss
i
was
only
told
to
come
here
for
you
the
driver
opened
the
door
and
penny
stepped
into
the
car
they
sped
away
presently
penny
noticed
that
the
taxi
man
seemed
to
be
avoiding
the
main
streets
of
the
city
she
thought
little
of
it
until
she
chanced
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
driver
face
in
the
mirror
she
had
never
viewed
such
a
hardened
countenance
the
man
appeared
to
be
watching
her
every
move
it
gave
her
a
sudden
chill
where
is
my
father
she
questioned
abruptly
at
a
house
out
in
the
country
the
driver
returned
gruffly
i
did
even
know
that
he
had
left
the
city
penny
said
suspiciously
tell
me
how
was
he
injured
i
do
know
any
of
the
details
you
have
to
wait
until
you
get
there
penny
leaned
back
against
the
cushions
to
all
appearances
reassured
actually
she
was
terrified
the
conviction
was
steadily
growing
in
her
mind
that
she
had
been
the
victim
of
treachery
she
was
almost
certain
that
she
was
being
kidnapped
how
decidedly
stupid
she
had
been
to
walk
into
such
a
trap
penny
felt
actually
sick
as
she
considered
the
possible
consequence
of
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
molberg
gang
it
was
not
for
herself
that
she
feared
but
for
her
father
she
knew
him
well
enough
to
realize
that
he
would
sacrifice
everything
to
be
assured
of
her
safety
if
i
let
on
that
i
suspect
something
is
wrong
it
will
only
put
the
driver
on
his
guard
she
thought
my
best
chance
is
to
act
innocent
and
watch
for
an
opportunity
to
jump
out
of
the
car
already
they
were
speeding
along
a
dark
country
road
on
either
side
the
highway
was
lined
with
tall
maples
and
oak
trees
houses
were
few
and
far
between
penny
tried
to
make
careful
mental
note
of
the
route
they
were
taking
from
the
city
it
was
difficult
to
distinguish
objects
for
they
were
traveling
rapidly
as
they
turned
into
a
bumpy
winding
narrow
road
which
led
up
a
steep
hill
penny
uneasiness
increased
from
the
manner
in
which
the
driver
surveyed
the
roadside
she
guessed
that
the
wild
ride
was
nearly
ended
it
now
or
never
she
told
herself
grimly
the
car
had
slowed
down
for
the
hill
watching
her
chance
penny
made
a
sudden
dive
for
the
door
it
was
locked
she
located
the
catch
but
not
until
the
driver
had
managed
to
halt
the
car
with
an
enraged
snarl
he
caught
her
roughly
by
the
arm
just
as
she
flung
open
the
door
penny
wriggled
from
his
grasp
and
started
to
run
down
the
road
stop
or
i
shoot
the
driver
shouted
furiously
penny
paid
no
heed
she
raced
as
fast
as
she
could
go
down
the
hill
the
driver
an
agile
man
despite
his
heavy
build
took
up
the
pursuit
penny
could
hear
his
feet
pounding
on
the
hard
road
behind
her
he
was
gaining
her
breath
began
to
come
with
increasing
difficulty
she
could
run
no
faster
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
penny
noticed
an
automobile
without
headlights
she
was
sure
it
had
not
been
parked
there
a
few
minutes
earlier
when
the
cab
had
passed
had
some
of
rap
molberg
men
followed
the
taxi
in
that
event
she
was
running
straight
into
another
trap
penny
had
no
choice
but
to
continue
toward
the
waiting
automobile
but
as
three
men
sprang
from
behind
it
with
drawn
revolvers
her
heart
sank
within
her
her
brave
attempt
at
escape
must
end
in
failure
a
stone
lay
in
the
road
penny
did
not
see
it
she
stumbled
and
completely
exhausted
fell
face
downward
into
the
dirt
stay
where
you
are
a
cool
voice
ordered
do
move
she
remained
as
she
was
prone
upon
the
ground
a
revolver
barked
there
was
a
flash
of
fire
dangerously
close
by
an
answering
bullet
from
the
opposite
direction
whizzed
over
her
head
the
three
men
moved
cautiously
up
the
hill
they
had
their
quarry
covered
drop
your
gun
came
the
sharp
order
the
taxi
driver
mutely
obeyed
as
handcuffs
were
snapped
over
his
wrists
penny
hurried
forward
to
view
her
rescuers
one
of
the
men
she
instantly
recognized
as
a
detective
employed
by
her
father
the
other
two
she
had
never
before
seen
how
did
you
get
here
she
gasped
we
been
trailing
you
all
day
the
investigator
explained
as
he
deftly
searched
his
prisoner
for
concealed
weapons
the
entire
week
for
that
matter
your
father
orders
you
mean
he
had
me
shadowed
penny
demanded
indignantly
nichols
was
afraid
something
like
this
might
be
attempted
i
guess
it
was
lucky
for
me
that
i
was
trailed
penny
acknowledged
gratefully
otherwise
i
have
been
kidnapped
she
watched
as
the
prisoner
was
led
to
the
waiting
car
do
you
know
who
he
is
she
asked
a
detective
looks
like
angel
face
myers
one
of
molberg
boys
ca
be
sure
we
mugged
and
him
at
the
station
the
three
men
from
the
nichols
agency
plied
the
prisoner
with
sharp
questions
he
maintained
a
sullen
silence
i
guess
he
was
taking
miss
nichols
to
that
abandoned
house
at
the
top
of
the
hill
one
of
the
detectives
surmised
shrewdly
i
stay
here
and
guard
the
prisoner
while
you
fellows
investigate
the
place
do
let
anyone
get
away
from
you
the
other
two
detectives
disappeared
into
the
darkness
twenty
minutes
later
they
returned
to
report
that
they
had
found
no
one
at
the
old
house
although
there
was
evidence
of
a
hurried
departure
the
shots
previously
fired
by
the
detectives
had
served
as
a
warning
riding
back
to
the
city
with
the
handcuffed
prisoner
penny
wondered
how
faithfully
her
father
investigators
had
followed
her
movements
of
the
evening
had
they
noted
her
call
at
the
davis
home
or
the
visit
she
and
susan
had
paid
to
the
hamilton
building
i
suppose
i
been
trailed
everywhere
she
ventured
conversationally
you
almost
gave
us
the
slip
one
of
the
detectives
told
her
with
a
smile
in
fact
you
did
for
awhile
when
was
that
right
after
you
left
the
library
you
turned
off
somewhere
and
we
lost
you
for
a
time
did
locate
you
again
until
you
turned
up
at
your
own
home
penny
was
relieved
the
detectives
could
not
possibly
be
aware
of
the
secret
entrance
into
the
hamilton
plant
she
would
still
be
the
first
to
report
the
discovery
to
her
father
the
detectives
dropped
penny
at
her
own
home
after
explaining
that
it
might
be
necessary
for
her
to
appear
in
court
later
on
to
identify
the
prisoner
i
be
very
glad
to
do
it
penny
promised
as
she
ran
up
the
front
steps
the
door
was
flung
open
and
gallup
rushed
out
to
meet
her
she
flung
her
arms
about
the
girl
penny
she
cried
tremulously
how
thankful
i
am
that
you
are
safe
your
father
came
home
fifteen
minutes
ago
then
we
knew
that
the
telephone
call
was
a
fake
where
is
dad
now
he
started
for
the
police
station
then
i
guess
he
learn
the
truth
in
a
few
minutes
if
he
still
there
tell
me
what
happened
penny
in
the
midst
of
the
tale
a
car
was
heard
on
the
driveway
and
a
minute
later
nichols
entered
the
house
although
he
was
never
inclined
to
be
demonstrative
the
detective
clasped
his
daughter
in
his
arms
and
penny
noticed
that
his
hands
trembled
slightly
i
just
heard
the
entire
story
at
the
police
station
he
told
her
you
gave
me
a
terrific
scare
penny
i
gave
myself
one
too
if
it
had
been
for
your
men
who
shadowed
me
i
afraid
i
never
have
returned
to
tell
the
tale
i
doubt
that
the
gangsters
would
have
actually
harmed
you
but
they
would
have
used
you
as
a
weapon
to
strike
back
at
me
i
am
sorry
about
having
you
trailed
penny
but
you
understand
my
position
i
was
afraid
of
this
very
thing
it
all
right
penny
smiled
only
your
men
are
so
clever
at
keeping
me
in
sight
i
unintentionally
gave
them
the
slip
earlier
in
the
evening
gallup
had
gone
to
the
kitchen
to
prepare
sandwiches
and
an
iced
drink
taking
advantage
of
her
absence
penny
gave
a
detailed
report
of
her
visit
to
the
hamilton
plant
at
first
her
father
listened
almost
incredulously
it
sounds
fantastic
penny
and
yet
it
just
the
sort
of
trickery
which
would
appeal
to
rap
molberg
you
say
the
door
is
operated
by
means
of
a
cell
that
what
i
think
at
least
when
the
beam
of
my
light
struck
a
certain
spot
on
the
wall
the
door
opened
nichols
arose
and
paced
rapidly
back
and
forth
across
the
floor
i
going
to
take
you
into
my
confidence
penny
he
said
quietly
for
days
my
men
have
been
circling
in
on
rap
and
his
gang
located
one
of
their
hideouts
and
we
raiding
the
place
tomorrow
night
it
now
seems
advisable
to
surround
the
hamilton
building
simultaneously
then
there
will
be
no
chance
that
any
of
the
crooks
can
use
the
underground
ramp
to
make
a
will
the
police
make
the
raid
penny
inquired
curiously
yes
and
no
so
far
i
have
taken
only
one
man
into
my
confidence
and
who
is
that
jerome
davis
i
was
at
his
house
this
evening
penny
announced
a
threatening
note
was
thrown
through
the
window
while
i
was
there
she
repeated
the
contents
of
the
message
no
doubt
it
came
from
the
molberg
gang
her
father
said
they
are
doing
everything
in
their
power
to
intimidate
jerome
davis
but
i
believe
he
is
a
man
who
can
be
trusted
tomorrow
night
at
eleven
he
will
be
ready
with
a
picked
group
of
policemen
no
one
but
himself
will
know
any
of
the
details
of
the
raid
until
it
is
actually
on
in
that
way
there
will
be
almost
no
danger
of
the
information
leaking
out
where
is
this
other
hideout
which
is
to
be
raided
i
ca
tell
you
that
it
is
that
i
do
trust
you
but
sometimes
an
unguarded
word
will
destroy
the
work
of
weeks
i
guess
it
just
as
well
i
do
know
too
much
about
it
ahead
of
time
penny
agreed
the
conversation
was
checked
as
gallup
came
from
the
kitchen
with
a
tray
of
sandwiches
and
a
tall
pitcher
of
fruit
juice
for
a
time
penny
and
her
father
confined
their
talk
to
less
vital
subjects
but
when
the
housekeeper
had
gone
from
the
room
again
nichols
took
up
the
matter
where
it
had
been
dropped
if
my
raids
tomorrow
night
are
successful
it
will
end
the
case
we
may
need
you
penny
to
show
the
officers
how
to
get
into
the
hamilton
building
i
like
to
help
she
assured
him
eagerly
good
nichols
said
warmly
as
he
picked
up
the
evening
paper
until
the
appointed
hour
do
go
near
the
plant
and
mind
not
a
word
of
this
to
anyone
chapter
xiii
the
raid
at
exactly
ten
minutes
to
eleven
on
the
following
night
eight
police
cars
rolled
swiftly
down
the
boulevard
in
a
congested
portion
of
the
city
they
drew
up
to
the
curbing
waiting
for
christopher
nichols
who
rode
with
his
daughter
in
a
dark
sedan
jerome
davis
in
charge
of
the
raid
came
over
to
speak
to
the
detective
everything
is
all
set
nichols
we
have
the
entire
neighborhood
bottled
up
every
alley
and
street
guarded
good
and
the
hamilton
building
it
is
surrounded
at
exactly
eleven
my
men
will
raid
both
places
it
a
cinch
we
get
rap
molberg
and
his
gang
this
time
you
certain
no
hint
of
the
raid
has
leaked
out
jerome
davis
laughed
confidently
even
now
my
men
are
sure
what
coming
off
this
raid
ca
fail
nichols
we
had
a
straight
tip
where
molberg
could
be
found
and
we
get
him
then
go
ahead
exactly
as
we
planned
nichols
directed
on
to
the
blind
pig
café
jerome
davis
returned
to
the
waiting
cars
relaying
the
orders
in
single
file
the
police
automobiles
moved
forward
they
rounded
a
corner
and
bore
down
upon
a
brightly
illuminated
restaurant
with
a
start
penny
recognized
it
as
the
same
place
where
she
had
met
betty
davis
the
previous
evening
what
a
coincidence
she
thought
how
embarrassing
it
would
be
for
davis
if
his
son
should
be
found
in
there
tonight
the
appearance
of
the
first
officer
in
the
doorway
of
the
blind
pig
was
sufficient
to
give
warning
that
a
raid
was
under
way
the
few
persons
who
were
dining
inside
made
wild
dashes
for
the
doors
and
windows
they
were
quickly
captured
by
officers
stationed
at
all
the
exits
although
the
room
lights
had
been
snapped
out
no
shots
were
fired
something
is
wrong
nichols
exclaimed
abruptly
leaving
the
sedan
from
which
he
had
been
watching
it
looks
to
me
like
a
a
few
minutes
after
her
father
had
disappeared
into
the
café
penny
saw
the
policemen
load
perhaps
six
or
seven
prisoners
into
the
waiting
cars
but
it
was
apparent
even
to
her
that
the
raid
had
failed
the
persons
arrested
obviously
were
not
members
of
the
molberg
gang
nichol
face
was
dark
when
he
came
back
to
the
sedan
without
a
word
he
started
the
engine
and
drove
rapidly
off
what
happened
penny
asked
timidly
oh
the
usual
the
detective
snapped
it
was
a
only
a
few
persons
were
in
the
café
and
the
clubrooms
to
the
rear
were
completely
deserted
not
a
scrap
of
evidence
we
have
to
release
all
the
prisoners
where
are
we
going
now
dad
to
the
hamilton
plant
there
just
a
chance
that
the
raid
there
was
more
successful
though
i
doubt
it
who
could
have
carried
the
information
penny
inquired
i
do
know
that
what
bothers
me
penny
you
certain
you
never
dropped
a
word
of
this
why
of
course
not
i
do
mean
intentionally
of
course
you
sure
you
never
mentioned
the
raid
to
your
friend
susan
absolutely
not
penny
maintained
indignantly
for
that
matter
i
did
know
the
blind
pig
was
the
place
you
were
raiding
that
true
nichols
acknowledged
i
did
mean
to
offend
you
penny
i
was
only
seeking
information
i
ca
see
how
the
news
leaked
out
unless
unless
what
penny
probed
i
not
say
it
you
meant
unless
jerome
davis
had
betrayed
his
trust
well
yes
that
was
what
i
was
thinking
this
is
the
first
occasion
i
had
to
question
his
honesty
it
may
be
i
have
given
enough
consideration
to
the
stories
which
have
circulated
regarding
davis
you
said
you
believed
they
were
started
by
his
political
enemies
yes
and
i
still
inclined
to
think
that
although
the
failure
of
this
raid
looks
peculiar
to
say
the
least
i
have
to
be
more
careful
in
my
dealings
with
davis
if
the
molberg
outfit
did
regard
him
as
an
enemy
then
why
would
they
throw
a
warning
note
through
the
window
penny
demanded
that
could
have
been
faked
it
might
have
been
a
dodge
to
impress
you
i
do
see
how
it
could
have
been
dad
you
see
i
met
betty
davis
quite
by
accident
that
evening
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
i
accepted
her
invitation
to
stop
a
few
minutes
at
the
house
it
was
while
i
was
there
that
the
message
was
thrown
through
the
window
it
could
have
been
planned
not
very
well
nichols
admitted
davis
may
be
honest
enough
but
if
i
find
he
a
loose
talker
his
usefulness
for
me
will
be
ended
the
sedan
had
reached
the
street
which
led
to
the
vacant
hamilton
plant
an
officer
stepped
out
of
the
shadow
to
challenge
nichols
but
recognizing
him
saluted
instead
what
luck
the
detective
asked
i
ca
tell
you
sir
i
heard
nothing
since
i
was
stationed
here
penny
and
her
father
drove
on
between
the
rows
of
police
cars
which
lined
the
narrow
street
as
they
halted
at
the
far
end
of
the
thoroughfare
an
officer
came
to
speak
with
them
did
you
get
into
the
building
nichols
inquired
tersely
yes
your
daughter
instructions
were
very
clear
we
had
no
trouble
what
did
you
find
everything
was
exactly
as
miss
nichols
said
the
place
has
been
used
by
the
molberg
outfit
that
clear
but
there
was
a
sign
of
anyone
and
the
desk
which
miss
nichols
mentioned
as
being
in
the
little
office
was
gone
looks
like
they
got
wind
of
what
was
up
does
it
that
the
way
i
figure
it
the
officer
returned
not
much
we
can
do
except
wreck
the
place
so
it
ca
be
used
again
nichols
talked
with
several
other
policemen
and
then
satisfied
that
he
had
learned
all
the
details
of
the
unsuccessful
raid
took
penny
home
i
suppose
this
means
we
not
be
taking
that
vacation
into
the
mountains
very
soon
she
commented
when
they
were
alone
in
the
living
room
i
afraid
of
it
penny
would
you
care
to
go
by
yourself
no
i
prefer
to
wait
until
you
can
go
too
besides
i
become
deeply
absorbed
in
this
molberg
case
i
noticed
that
her
father
smiled
i
never
suspected
that
my
own
daughter
had
such
hidden
talents
for
sleuthing
now
you
teasing
penny
accused
no
your
discoveries
have
astonished
me
penny
perhaps
you
were
favored
a
little
by
luck
but
you
unearthed
information
which
even
my
most
skilled
investigators
were
unable
to
turn
up
my
clues
did
prove
of
much
value
after
all
it
was
your
fault
that
they
did
a
detective
must
learn
to
expect
disappointments
so
it
seems
penny
sighed
now
that
rap
molberg
escaped
the
police
net
what
will
be
your
next
move
i
do
know
yet
penny
perhaps
rap
molberg
will
leave
the
city
i
do
think
there
much
chance
of
that
he
remain
in
hiding
for
a
few
days
or
weeks
then
strike
again
you
must
have
a
constant
bodyguard
penny
oh
dad
if
you
knew
how
i
hated
it
i
could
feel
that
even
my
thoughts
were
my
own
sorry
penny
but
it
for
your
own
safety
oh
all
right
i
submit
penny
grumbled
only
if
i
must
have
someone
tagging
at
my
heels
all
the
time
please
make
him
tall
and
handsome
i
do
usually
select
my
men
for
their
beauty
nichols
smiled
but
i
do
the
best
i
can
for
you
although
penny
disliked
the
idea
of
being
closely
watched
actually
a
bodyguard
was
not
as
annoying
as
she
had
imagined
it
might
be
joe
franey
the
detective
assigned
by
nichols
to
the
service
was
young
and
while
not
handsome
distinguished
in
appearance
his
bearing
gave
no
hint
of
his
professional
calling
penny
found
joe
very
likeable
he
never
irritated
her
by
making
her
aware
of
his
presence
in
fact
for
hours
at
a
time
she
never
saw
him
at
all
yet
when
she
was
on
the
street
she
was
seldom
out
of
his
sight
for
the
next
few
days
following
joe
assignment
to
his
new
duties
penny
and
susan
slyly
amused
themselves
by
trying
to
see
if
they
could
outwit
him
they
led
the
detective
a
gay
chase
from
one
end
of
the
city
to
another
they
dropped
into
department
stores
dodging
in
one
door
and
out
another
but
when
they
were
confident
they
had
baffled
joe
they
were
very
apt
to
see
him
watching
them
from
a
doorway
across
the
street
or
if
they
entered
a
theatre
apparently
unobserved
by
the
faithful
sleuth
they
were
almost
certain
to
see
him
only
a
few
seats
behind
but
soon
joe
became
such
a
fixture
in
penny
life
that
she
accepted
him
without
much
thought
true
to
nichols
prediction
all
remained
quiet
on
the
rap
molberg
front
save
that
the
unsuccessful
raid
had
stirred
up
an
aftermath
of
bitter
criticism
the
local
newspapers
provided
considerable
unfavorable
publicity
editors
ran
scorching
editorials
blaming
nichols
and
the
police
for
the
failure
to
break
up
the
molberg
gang
infuriated
by
the
comments
of
the
press
the
police
commissioner
called
both
the
detective
and
jerome
davis
to
his
office
neither
could
explain
the
failure
of
the
raid
it
was
obvious
that
someone
had
allowed
information
to
leak
and
since
only
nichols
and
a
few
policemen
had
known
the
details
of
the
raid
suspicion
tended
to
center
upon
jerome
davis
it
only
a
matter
of
days
until
he
be
discharged
from
the
force
nichols
told
his
daughter
surely
you
do
think
he
be
guilty
of
helping
rap
molberg
penny
questioned
i
do
know
what
to
believe
davis
was
called
on
the
carpet
yesterday
and
given
an
opportunity
to
explain
a
number
of
things
he
would
talk
but
that
does
prove
necessarily
that
he
guilty
does
it
no
but
he
acted
strangely
of
late
the
fact
remains
that
someone
let
information
leak
either
by
accident
or
deliberately
davis
was
in
a
bad
spot
before
this
now
i
afraid
nothing
can
save
his
job
i
feel
so
sorry
for
betty
penny
murmured
she
take
it
hard
if
her
father
is
discharged
you
must
worry
about
it
nichols
advised
kindly
davis
had
his
chance
to
make
good
and
seemingly
failed
now
matters
must
take
their
own
course
could
you
do
anything
to
save
his
position
dad
i
doubt
it
penny
at
any
rate
i
should
care
to
interfere
for
i
not
convinced
that
the
commissioner
is
right
davis
is
a
queer
type
just
the
same
i
ca
help
feeling
he
honest
penny
maintained
firmly
could
there
have
been
another
reason
for
the
failure
of
the
raid
yes
but
davis
was
under
suspicion
before
this
and
since
the
raid
he
been
anything
but
cooperative
then
i
suppose
nothing
can
be
done
but
it
seems
a
pity
penny
did
not
speak
of
the
matter
again
to
her
father
but
in
secret
she
continued
to
mull
over
the
unfortunate
situation
she
had
developed
a
deep
liking
for
betty
davis
yet
she
readily
acknowledged
that
in
many
ways
the
girl
acted
queerly
it
too
much
for
me
to
figure
out
penny
confessed
to
susan
one
afternoon
everything
seems
to
be
such
a
hopeless
contradiction
betty
lets
on
that
she
is
desperately
afraid
her
father
will
be
harmed
by
rap
molberg
and
yet
the
police
claim
that
davis
is
really
abetting
the
criminals
have
you
ever
met
her
brother
jimmie
penny
asked
no
but
from
what
she
told
me
i
suspect
something
of
a
problem
i
have
seen
betty
in
days
susan
remarked
why
not
call
on
her
this
afternoon
penny
hesitated
an
instant
then
agreed
considering
her
association
with
davis
she
was
not
certain
that
the
visit
would
be
very
tactful
we
must
be
careful
and
not
say
anything
that
could
offend
her
she
warned
of
course
susan
agreed
shall
we
drive
over
in
my
car
at
the
davis
cottage
a
few
minutes
later
they
caught
a
glimpse
of
someone
moving
about
on
the
upper
floor
but
when
they
rapped
upon
the
door
there
was
no
response
i
know
i
saw
betty
looking
out
of
an
upstairs
window
just
as
we
drove
up
susan
whispered
perhaps
she
does
care
to
see
us
then
come
on
sue
let
not
knock
again
they
quietly
withdrew
to
the
car
where
to
now
susan
inquired
as
she
snapped
on
the
ignition
oh
anywhere
i
nothing
special
to
do
this
afternoon
susan
stepped
on
the
electric
starter
but
the
engine
refused
to
respond
she
readjusted
gasoline
and
spark
levers
to
no
avail
stalled
again
she
complained
bitterly
i
never
saw
such
a
car
we
had
nothing
but
trouble
since
we
bought
it
perhaps
it
only
flooded
penny
suggested
hopefully
susan
shook
her
head
it
done
this
before
nothing
to
do
but
call
the
garage
anyway
brunner
promised
he
give
the
car
a
free
overhaul
and
this
is
his
chance
to
make
good
the
girls
telephoned
the
brunner
garage
from
a
drug
store
located
directly
across
the
street
they
waited
nearly
half
an
hour
before
the
blue
service
car
arrived
to
tow
them
in
may
i
speak
to
mr
brunner
susan
politely
asked
one
of
the
garage
employees
sorry
but
he
busy
was
the
curt
reply
i
handle
any
complaint
you
have
to
make
susan
gave
a
somewhat
lengthy
account
of
her
car
troubles
the
employee
scarcely
bothered
to
listen
when
she
had
finished
he
said
briefly
i
check
the
car
over
and
have
it
ready
in
half
an
hour
let
wait
susan
proposed
they
found
chairs
nearby
in
fifteen
minutes
the
same
employee
returned
to
report
that
the
car
was
ready
so
soon
susan
said
in
surprise
why
i
sure
you
could
have
checked
over
everything
in
such
a
short
while
the
car
will
start
now
if
you
want
a
general
overhaul
you
have
to
pay
for
it
but
brunner
promised
me
when
i
bought
the
automobile
that
if
anything
went
wrong
he
make
it
right
susan
protested
indignantly
i
driven
the
car
less
than
five
hundred
miles
and
it
almost
falling
apart
may
i
see
mr
brunner
he
in
his
office
the
man
informed
reluctantly
and
where
is
that
down
the
hall
the
second
door
from
the
end
crossing
through
the
deserted
repair
shop
the
girls
made
their
way
down
the
dark
hallway
the
door
which
the
employee
had
indicated
stood
slightly
ajar
as
penny
and
susan
drew
near
they
heard
angry
voices
you
can
threaten
me
all
you
like
but
i
tell
you
i
through
never
do
any
more
work
for
you
brunner
you
do
exactly
as
i
say
or
the
manager
abruptly
broke
off
for
he
had
noticed
the
two
girls
standing
at
the
open
door
come
in
come
in
he
beamed
penny
keen
glance
traveled
beyond
george
brunner
to
the
person
whom
he
had
addressed
in
such
an
abusive
tone
it
was
jerry
barrows
chapter
xiv
brunner
explanation
jerry
barrows
had
recognized
penny
instantly
before
she
could
recover
from
her
surprise
at
seeing
him
he
wheeled
and
left
the
office
by
a
side
door
involuntarily
penny
started
to
follow
but
without
appearing
to
do
so
intentionally
the
manager
neatly
blocked
her
path
a
disgruntled
employee
of
mine
he
announced
blandly
i
had
a
great
deal
of
trouble
with
him
he
a
fine
workman
but
difficult
to
manage
what
sort
of
work
does
he
do
penny
inquired
alertly
the
manager
was
slightly
taken
aback
at
the
question
he
answered
evasively
oh
he
runs
my
tow
truck
and
does
odd
jobs
about
the
garage
i
seen
him
before
penny
remarked
but
his
name
has
slipped
my
mind
it
not
jerry
barrows
is
it
the
manager
scrutinized
her
intently
for
a
moment
his
eyes
held
a
fleeting
expression
of
annoyance
and
dislike
now
i
sorry
but
i
ca
tell
you
his
name
he
said
apologetically
i
do
know
that
i
ever
heard
it
although
it
must
be
on
our
pay
rolls
of
course
i
remember
very
few
of
my
employees
by
their
names
penny
and
susan
exchanged
a
quick
glance
which
the
manager
noted
they
were
both
firmly
convinced
that
brunner
knew
the
name
but
did
not
wish
to
reveal
it
since
the
boy
is
an
employee
of
yours
probably
i
could
get
his
name
and
address
from
the
pay
roll
penny
suggested
pointedly
brunner
hesitated
although
only
momentarily
why
certainly
he
said
genially
i
secure
it
for
you
myself
drop
in
any
time
next
week
and
i
have
it
for
you
could
i
get
it
today
penny
persisted
i
am
afraid
that
is
impossible
brunner
smiled
a
trifle
coldly
it
is
nearly
time
for
me
to
leave
the
office
now
did
you
young
ladies
wish
to
see
me
about
another
matter
susan
recounted
her
many
unpleasant
experiences
in
regard
to
the
newly
purchased
automobile
the
manager
listened
politely
but
with
increasing
frigidity
you
must
have
misunderstood
me
miss
altman
he
said
when
she
had
finished
we
ca
undertake
to
guarantee
every
car
which
leaves
our
shop
as
a
courtesy
to
our
customers
we
do
occasionally
make
a
few
minor
repairs
free
of
charge
we
have
found
it
impractical
to
go
further
than
this
but
in
my
case
the
car
has
run
less
than
five
hundred
miles
susan
protested
with
growing
anger
it
seems
to
me
i
entitled
to
service
you
must
see
my
repair
man
miss
altman
he
adjusts
all
such
matters
i
have
seen
him
and
i
had
no
satisfaction
at
all
then
i
afraid
there
nothing
more
we
can
do
for
you
your
guarantee
means
nothing
we
stand
behind
our
cars
miss
altman
but
you
must
have
misunderstood
my
promise
to
service
your
new
automobile
free
of
charge
you
said
that
at
the
end
of
five
hundred
miles
my
car
would
receive
a
complete
overhaul
but
my
dear
young
lady
you
have
just
received
this
service
your
workman
spent
less
than
twenty
minutes
going
over
my
car
have
you
driven
it
since
well
no
i
have
susan
admitted
reluctantly
then
i
know
you
will
find
everything
satisfactory
for
our
workmen
are
efficient
good
afternoon
miss
altman
the
manager
opened
the
door
in
pointed
suggestion
that
the
girls
leave
outside
in
the
hall
they
gave
vent
to
their
pent
up
feelings
you
were
right
penny
susan
declared
angrily
i
should
have
bought
my
car
at
another
garage
i
never
did
like
that
man
penny
added
he
such
a
smooth
talker
and
yet
down
under
he
mean
and
selfish
i
wonder
if
jerry
barrows
actually
does
work
for
him
he
was
threatening
him
when
we
surprised
them
in
the
office
i
know
and
it
annoyed
brunner
because
we
saw
him
talking
with
the
boy
at
all
i
am
as
sure
as
anything
that
he
never
give
me
his
real
name
or
address
that
why
he
suggested
that
you
come
back
later
for
it
susan
agreed
when
you
return
he
have
some
other
excuse
i
mean
to
go
back
and
annoy
him
just
the
same
does
it
strike
you
as
odd
that
jerry
would
be
working
for
him
well
perhaps
a
trifle
susan
said
thoughtfully
but
it
may
be
that
he
hired
the
boy
without
inquiring
too
carefully
into
his
past
the
fact
remains
that
brunner
was
threatening
him
penny
pointed
out
it
did
appear
to
me
that
it
was
about
any
casual
matter
either
the
girls
lowered
their
voices
for
they
had
come
within
earshot
of
a
garageman
who
was
working
in
the
repair
shop
susan
car
was
nearby
after
some
difficulty
she
managed
to
start
it
but
the
engine
knocked
as
badly
as
before
i
suppose
there
nothing
to
do
but
take
the
car
to
another
garage
susan
said
irritably
i
never
come
here
again
i
know
that
let
go
for
a
swim
and
drown
our
troubles
penny
suggested
the
big
dipper
will
be
open
since
the
day
had
been
sultry
the
proposal
appealed
to
susan
they
stopped
at
their
homes
only
long
enough
to
get
their
bathing
suits
and
a
few
minutes
later
arrived
at
the
picturesque
outdoor
pool
penny
found
several
of
her
school
friends
performing
at
the
diving
board
and
soon
they
were
all
rounded
up
for
a
vigorous
game
of
water
polo
after
a
fierce
battle
which
left
everyone
exhausted
side
conquered
the
opponents
the
girls
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
pool
to
rest
is
that
betty
davis
over
there
under
the
beach
umbrella
susan
presently
inquired
indicating
a
girl
in
a
black
bathing
suit
who
sat
alone
why
it
is
penny
agreed
shall
we
go
over
and
speak
to
her
after
the
way
she
treated
us
this
afternoon
we
ca
be
certain
she
was
in
the
house
when
we
called
i
think
she
was
susan
maintained
she
does
care
for
our
company
that
all
she
seemed
to
like
us
well
enough
at
first
betty
is
the
sensitive
type
sue
it
may
be
that
she
embarrassed
on
account
of
all
her
father
trouble
i
believe
i
swim
over
and
speak
to
her
at
any
rate
penny
arose
from
the
side
of
the
pool
without
having
appeared
to
notice
the
action
betty
davis
hastily
left
the
reclining
chair
under
the
umbrella
and
disappeared
into
the
dressing
room
i
guess
you
too
late
susan
laughed
she
saw
you
first
penny
sat
down
again
a
trifle
nettled
you
right
sue
she
deliberately
avoiding
us
she
a
queer
sort
anyway
susan
said
indifferently
let
ignore
her
from
now
on
penny
gazed
thoughtfully
toward
the
dressing
room
door
there
must
be
some
reason
for
the
way
she
acting
sue
i
have
a
notion
to
corner
her
in
the
dressing
room
so
that
she
have
to
say
something
to
me
you
inviting
a
snub
if
you
do
forget
her
penny
come
on
race
you
to
the
end
of
the
pool
she
plunged
in
and
penny
reluctantly
followed
they
swam
two
lengths
and
then
dived
a
few
times
from
the
high
board
oh
let
go
home
penny
proposed
presently
i
had
enough
they
stood
for
a
few
minutes
under
the
cold
shower
then
entered
the
dressing
room
to
their
surprise
they
observed
a
group
of
excited
girls
clustered
around
the
matron
desk
i
tell
you
it
my
ring
one
of
the
bathers
insisted
angrily
this
girl
stole
it
from
my
locker
it
is
true
the
ring
is
my
own
why
it
belonged
to
my
mother
penny
and
susan
pushed
their
way
into
the
little
group
they
had
recognized
betty
davis
low
pitched
voice
but
were
unacquainted
with
the
girl
who
was
accusing
her
of
the
theft
let
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
the
matron
said
severely
turning
to
the
first
girl
did
you
have
your
locker
fastened
securely
no
that
how
she
got
in
i
forgot
to
lock
it
she
had
the
locker
next
to
mine
and
she
must
have
snatched
the
ring
while
i
was
in
the
shower
betty
face
was
pale
but
with
an
effort
she
remained
calm
as
she
refuted
the
charge
i
do
know
anything
about
this
girl
ring
the
one
i
have
is
my
own
give
it
to
me
the
matron
ordered
reluctantly
betty
removed
the
ring
from
her
finger
it
was
a
white
gold
band
with
a
cluster
of
three
tiny
diamonds
in
the
act
of
handing
it
over
she
suddenly
changed
her
mind
i
not
give
up
my
own
property
this
was
my
mother
engagement
ring
and
she
dead
now
can
you
prove
your
story
the
matron
questioned
you
can
call
my
father
jerome
davis
he
is
on
the
police
force
yes
but
he
wo
be
there
long
the
first
girl
said
scornfully
everyone
knows
he
to
be
let
out
because
of
dishonesty
and
your
brother
do
you
dare
say
a
word
against
either
my
father
or
jimmie
betty
cried
girls
girls
the
matron
chided
severely
we
discuss
this
matter
calmly
please
penny
stepped
forward
i
think
i
may
be
able
to
help
she
said
quietly
i
happen
to
know
that
the
ring
belongs
to
betty
davis
for
i
have
seen
her
wearing
it
you
a
friend
of
hers
the
other
girl
accused
on
the
contrary
i
scarcely
know
miss
davis
but
i
believe
in
seeing
justice
done
if
you
actually
lost
a
similar
ring
you
may
find
it
on
the
floor
near
your
locker
have
you
looked
carefully
the
matron
questioned
of
course
i
have
the
ring
is
gone
and
this
davis
girl
stole
it
i
search
your
locker
myself
the
matron
decided
show
me
which
one
it
is
penny
and
the
others
followed
to
witness
the
inspection
article
by
article
the
matron
removed
everything
from
the
locker
but
the
ring
was
not
found
wait
and
i
sweep
the
floor
penny
offered
she
ran
to
find
a
broom
returning
with
it
a
minute
later
carefully
she
swept
the
space
in
the
vicinity
of
the
locker
you
see
it
gone
the
other
girl
insisted
eyeing
betty
davis
furiously
you
never
find
it
because
is
wearing
it
as
penny
broom
brushed
past
a
dark
corner
of
the
room
there
was
a
little
metallic
click
she
stooped
down
and
picked
up
a
ring
although
it
was
similar
in
appearance
to
the
one
which
betty
wore
the
resemblance
was
not
close
is
this
yours
she
inquired
offering
it
to
the
owner
of
the
locker
yes
it
is
the
girl
admitted
i
do
know
how
it
came
to
be
on
the
floor
it
was
there
because
you
dropped
it
the
matron
said
sternly
next
time
be
more
careful
about
accusing
persons
penny
and
susan
turned
to
go
to
their
own
lockers
but
before
they
could
leave
betty
came
toward
them
timidly
thank
you
so
much
she
said
in
a
low
tone
i
owe
you
a
great
deal
not
at
all
penny
returned
a
trifle
stiffly
i
feel
ashamed
of
the
way
i
have
acted
lately
the
girl
went
on
hurriedly
avoiding
penny
penetrating
gaze
i
been
so
upset
about
everything
i
wish
i
could
explain
but
i
ca
i
think
perhaps
i
understand
betty
stared
hard
at
penny
but
she
quickly
masked
the
fleeting
expression
of
alarm
after
thanking
her
friends
again
she
turned
and
disappeared
in
the
direction
of
the
hair
drying
room
just
what
is
it
that
upsets
that
girl
so
penny
said
in
an
undertone
to
susan
as
they
went
to
their
own
lockers
she
acts
as
if
afraid
we
discover
something
about
her
yes
she
does
i
ca
figure
it
out
at
all
the
girls
quickly
dressed
but
by
the
time
they
had
dried
their
hair
and
were
ready
for
the
street
it
was
long
past
supper
time
i
had
no
idea
it
was
so
late
susan
declared
as
they
hurried
toward
the
parked
automobile
mother
will
be
worried
for
fear
something
has
happened
to
us
you
might
telephone
it
would
take
me
ages
to
find
a
i
be
home
in
a
minute
or
two
now
anyway
it
had
grown
quite
dark
but
although
automobiles
had
been
parked
close
together
near
the
swimming
pool
the
girls
experienced
little
difficulty
in
locating
susan
car
as
they
came
up
to
it
they
observed
that
a
garage
service
truck
had
drawn
up
to
an
automobile
only
a
short
distance
away
the
uniformed
garage
man
was
busy
changing
a
wheel
some
poor
fellow
had
a
flat
susan
said
sympathetically
strange
i
did
pick
up
the
nail
instead
my
luck
must
be
changing
penny
had
paused
to
survey
the
service
car
more
critically
the
garage
man
aware
that
he
was
under
scrutiny
gave
her
a
sharp
glance
then
abruptly
he
threw
his
tools
into
a
bag
jumped
into
his
truck
and
drove
away
leaving
his
work
unfinished
quick
see
if
you
can
get
the
license
number
penny
cried
i
ca
the
car
is
too
far
away
i
got
the
last
three
numbers
penny
informed
with
i
want
to
write
it
down
before
i
forget
susan
supplied
pencil
and
paper
from
her
purse
penny
jotted
down
the
number
why
did
you
want
it
susan
asked
curiously
you
do
think
that
man
was
trying
to
steal
a
wheel
i
certainly
do
otherwise
why
would
he
have
left
so
hurriedly
when
we
came
up
see
the
wheel
is
only
half
changed
they
walked
over
to
the
nearby
automobile
to
look
the
wheel
obviously
was
a
new
one
and
apparently
had
not
been
damaged
that
man
was
a
tire
thief
all
right
penny
announced
it
means
that
the
molberg
gang
is
starting
activities
again
i
must
get
in
touch
with
father
immediately
i
take
you
straight
home
susan
offered
if
i
been
just
a
little
quicker
i
have
caught
the
entire
license
number
penny
said
regretfully
even
so
it
may
be
possible
to
trace
the
car
returning
to
their
own
automobile
they
drove
rapidly
toward
the
nichols
home
chapter
xv
incriminating
evidence
penny
found
her
father
occupied
at
his
desk
in
the
study
recounting
her
experience
at
the
big
dipper
she
offered
him
the
license
number
which
she
had
copied
i
do
suppose
it
will
be
of
any
use
to
you
since
i
failed
to
get
the
entire
number
i
may
be
able
to
trace
the
car
though
i
rather
doubt
it
nichols
told
her
at
any
rate
from
what
you
seen
tonight
i
feel
confident
that
rap
molberg
is
shipping
another
truck
load
of
stolen
wheels
out
of
town
i
tip
off
the
police
to
be
on
the
lookout
some
months
previously
the
detective
had
installed
a
private
wire
which
connected
him
directly
with
the
police
station
he
used
it
now
to
talk
confidentially
with
the
police
commissioner
i
must
go
downtown
at
once
he
informed
penny
regretfully
after
making
the
call
do
wait
up
for
me
i
probably
wo
return
until
late
at
midnight
nichols
had
not
come
home
penny
after
dozing
for
some
hours
in
the
big
easy
chair
went
off
to
bed
not
until
morning
at
the
breakfast
table
did
she
learn
of
the
night
activities
as
usual
we
failed
to
make
a
capture
the
detective
acknowledged
gloomily
the
police
bottled
up
all
the
main
highways
leading
from
the
city
all
suspicious
trucks
were
searched
we
thought
certain
we
catch
molberg
with
the
goods
but
he
was
just
a
little
too
smart
for
us
again
were
many
wheels
stolen
last
night
penny
inquired
curiously
a
good
truck
load
at
least
this
case
has
begun
to
make
me
look
like
an
amateur
if
i
do
begin
to
close
in
on
the
molberg
gang
soon
be
the
laughing
stock
of
the
city
you
solve
the
case
penny
smiled
confidently
i
not
so
sure
of
that
you
see
while
molberg
is
a
daring
crook
the
evidence
indicates
that
he
is
merely
a
for
a
far
more
clever
criminal
a
master
mind
plans
out
every
move
that
the
gang
makes
yet
doubtlessly
that
person
has
never
been
under
suspicion
such
a
man
always
takes
care
to
keep
within
the
law
himself
although
he
engineers
the
most
daring
crimes
by
means
of
his
henchmen
and
of
course
they
take
all
the
risk
yes
if
his
gang
is
broken
up
he
merely
organizes
another
have
you
no
clue
as
to
where
this
so
called
mind
may
be
none
whatsoever
he
has
kept
his
hand
well
hidden
we
have
made
a
few
arrests
but
the
men
ca
be
made
to
talk
it
may
be
that
they
are
even
aware
of
his
identity
i
do
suppose
you
ever
been
able
to
get
any
evidence
against
that
place
where
susan
bought
the
stolen
wheel
penny
ventured
no
nothing
of
value
the
owner
has
a
very
bad
name
no
doubt
he
is
receiving
stolen
goods
but
it
is
always
hard
to
prove
anything
penny
relapsed
into
a
thoughtful
silence
which
she
presently
ended
by
saying
you
know
dad
a
peculiar
thing
happened
yesterday
i
do
suppose
it
could
have
the
slightest
connection
with
the
case
and
yet
it
set
me
to
thinking
what
was
that
nichols
asked
smilingly
i
saw
george
brunner
talking
with
jerry
barrows
in
his
office
that
young
protégé
of
yours
he
is
any
longer
penny
retorted
i
realize
now
that
i
was
deceived
by
his
story
but
why
should
he
be
working
for
mr
brunner
that
can
be
explained
easily
i
suppose
brunner
did
take
the
trouble
to
check
up
his
record
he
was
threatening
the
boy
penny
reported
her
eyebrows
puckering
into
a
frown
i
distinctly
heard
him
say
do
as
i
tell
you
or
then
he
saw
me
and
broke
off
you
certain
that
was
what
he
said
of
course
i
am
you
do
think
i
imagined
it
i
hope
no
nichols
laughed
but
one
ears
often
distort
conversation
it
does
seem
a
little
odd
that
brunner
should
have
any
connection
with
this
boy
still
there
must
be
a
logical
explanation
reputation
is
above
reproach
you
know
i
do
think
he
so
very
honest
penny
declared
after
the
way
he
acted
about
susan
car
i
would
trust
him
an
inch
brunner
does
make
glib
promises
the
detective
admitted
in
general
however
he
seems
to
have
operated
his
business
honestly
he
has
made
a
great
deal
of
money
penny
and
is
considered
one
of
belton
city
leading
citizens
i
do
see
where
he
makes
all
his
money
penny
complained
whenever
you
go
into
his
garage
it
usually
deserted
although
he
keeps
a
horde
of
discourteous
workmen
brunner
has
been
doing
so
well
of
late
nichols
agreed
i
think
he
bear
watching
penny
said
darkly
i
turn
the
task
over
to
you
nichols
chuckled
i
care
for
it
myself
digging
up
the
black
history
of
influential
citizens
is
the
most
profitable
occupation
in
the
world
realizing
that
she
was
being
teased
penny
dropped
the
subject
however
no
sooner
had
her
father
buried
himself
in
his
newspaper
again
than
she
thought
of
another
question
which
she
could
not
resist
asking
what
did
you
learn
about
that
license
number
i
gave
you
last
night
dad
it
was
issued
in
this
county
without
the
complete
number
it
will
be
impossible
to
trace
the
car
nichols
again
turned
to
his
newspaper
and
penny
permitted
him
to
read
undisturbed
she
knew
that
he
regarded
her
interest
in
the
molberg
case
with
amusement
he
was
humoring
her
in
her
desire
to
play
at
being
a
detective
but
while
he
listened
politely
to
her
questions
and
suggestions
he
did
not
really
believe
that
her
contributions
were
of
great
value
i
wish
i
could
show
him
penny
thought
determinedly
maybe
i
shall
too
nichols
blissfully
unaware
of
what
his
daughter
was
thinking
left
the
breakfast
table
i
be
out
of
the
city
all
day
he
informed
i
may
get
back
late
tonight
but
i
ca
be
sure
of
it
i
guess
you
be
well
looked
after
by
mrs
gallup
and
by
joe
penny
added
must
he
always
trail
me
around
dad
getting
so
tired
of
it
nichols
smiled
broadly
from
joe
daily
reports
i
suspected
he
was
the
one
who
was
growing
tired
you
seem
to
have
led
him
a
chase
he
turned
in
a
bill
for
nearly
forty
gallons
of
gasoline
last
week
he
must
be
drinking
it
then
penny
retorted
i
sure
my
old
car
could
have
traveled
any
such
distance
but
seriously
ca
you
discharge
him
not
until
the
case
is
finished
penny
and
when
will
that
be
i
wish
i
knew
if
all
cases
were
as
annoying
as
this
one
i
soon
be
out
of
business
but
we
have
several
new
leads
i
hoping
something
will
develop
within
the
next
week
i
may
do
a
little
sleuthing
of
my
own
just
to
hurry
matters
along
penny
warned
with
a
laugh
go
as
far
as
you
like
nichols
said
undisturbed
i
depend
upon
joe
to
see
that
you
do
get
into
too
hot
water
after
her
father
had
left
the
house
penny
went
to
the
where
she
taught
a
friday
morning
swimming
class
by
eleven
she
was
through
her
work
and
had
the
entire
day
before
her
making
her
way
to
the
business
section
of
the
city
she
did
a
little
shopping
at
one
of
the
department
stores
as
she
was
buying
a
pair
of
gloves
she
heard
her
name
spoken
turning
she
found
betty
davis
standing
beside
her
i
saw
you
from
across
the
aisle
the
girl
smiled
i
was
just
starting
home
she
hesitated
then
said
hurriedly
i
do
suppose
you
care
to
take
luncheon
with
me
why
i
love
it
penny
responded
instantly
i
not
much
of
a
cook
betty
confessed
modestly
but
i
can
always
scare
up
a
sandwich
or
so
penny
welcomed
an
opportunity
to
visit
the
davis
home
again
for
despite
betty
peculiar
actions
she
felt
that
the
girl
really
liked
her
as
they
boarded
a
street
car
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
had
been
invited
for
a
particular
purpose
the
girl
grew
increasingly
ill
at
ease
conversation
became
difficult
although
penny
made
a
special
effort
to
be
agreeable
not
until
luncheon
had
been
served
and
the
dishes
washed
did
betty
bring
up
the
matter
which
had
been
troubling
her
i
worried
about
father
she
confessed
the
truth
is
he
in
danger
of
losing
his
position
and
through
no
fault
of
his
own
penny
remained
silent
and
the
girl
went
on
with
increasing
embarrassment
i
do
know
how
to
say
it
you
been
so
kind
to
me
but
i
was
wondering
do
you
think
nichols
might
be
induced
to
intercede
in
behalf
of
my
father
i
speak
to
him
about
it
penny
promised
but
i
think
perhaps
it
would
be
better
if
your
father
talked
with
him
personally
oh
no
betty
said
hastily
he
never
do
that
you
see
he
know
that
i
have
said
anything
to
you
i
sure
he
would
like
it
i
see
penny
responded
quietly
i
talk
with
father
but
i
am
afraid
it
will
do
no
good
betty
shoulders
slumped
although
she
tried
to
smile
bravely
i
should
have
made
the
request
please
forget
it
no
i
mean
to
talk
to
father
about
it
penny
insisted
it
very
kind
of
you
i
never
have
mentioned
the
matter
at
all
only
i
realize
my
father
will
never
turn
a
hand
to
defend
himself
against
unjust
accusations
the
conversation
shifted
to
less
personal
subjects
as
penny
arose
to
leave
a
half
hour
later
she
spoke
casually
of
betty
brother
and
was
surprised
to
notice
a
strained
expression
pass
over
the
girl
face
you
were
going
to
show
me
his
picture
the
other
day
when
i
was
here
she
reminded
betty
oh
yes
so
i
was
the
other
agreed
but
with
out
enthusiasm
jimmie
is
very
good
looking
i
guess
i
told
you
he
was
a
football
player
at
waltham
high
last
year
i
like
to
meet
him
penny
remarked
jimmie
is
home
very
much
of
the
time
betty
returned
hastily
but
at
least
i
can
see
his
picture
penny
said
watching
the
girl
closely
why
yes
betty
stammered
ill
at
ease
i
get
it
she
went
into
an
adjoining
room
and
did
not
return
for
some
minutes
she
did
not
bring
the
photograph
avoiding
penny
gaze
she
said
apologetically
i
ca
seem
to
find
it
anywhere
i
must
have
misplaced
the
photo
it
does
matter
penny
returned
politely
she
had
guessed
instantly
that
betty
had
made
no
real
effort
to
find
the
photograph
for
some
reason
the
girl
no
longer
wished
her
to
see
it
after
chatting
for
a
short
while
longer
penny
took
her
leave
now
i
wonder
why
betty
was
so
reluctant
to
have
me
see
the
picture
she
reflected
as
she
walked
slowly
toward
the
street
car
line
more
interested
in
it
now
than
i
was
before
it
occurred
to
penny
that
if
only
she
could
find
a
copy
of
the
previous
year
waltham
high
school
annual
jimmie
davis
picture
was
almost
certain
to
appear
in
it
margery
barclay
brother
attended
that
school
she
recalled
i
might
be
able
to
get
an
annual
from
him
it
wo
be
out
of
my
way
to
stop
at
their
house
on
my
way
home
when
she
called
at
the
barclay
residence
barclay
answered
the
door
upon
learning
that
neither
margery
nor
her
brother
were
at
home
penny
mentioned
the
purpose
of
her
call
why
yes
we
have
one
of
the
annuals
barclay
told
her
i
am
sure
you
are
very
welcome
to
have
it
for
a
few
days
i
find
it
for
you
she
went
to
the
bookcase
and
after
searching
through
several
shelves
found
a
thick
dusty
volume
which
she
gave
to
penny
i
bring
it
back
tomorrow
mrs
barclay
keep
it
as
long
as
you
like
no
one
ever
looks
at
it
any
more
penny
thanked
barclay
and
tucking
the
book
under
her
arm
walked
slowly
toward
the
street
car
line
while
she
stood
at
the
corner
waiting
she
turned
a
few
of
the
pages
after
i
get
home
i
go
through
the
annual
systematically
she
decided
a
street
car
stopped
at
the
corner
and
she
boarded
it
seating
herself
near
the
rear
she
again
interested
herself
in
the
book
although
she
found
many
photographs
of
football
stars
she
did
not
immediately
locate
the
one
for
which
she
searched
then
she
turned
a
page
and
a
face
stood
out
beneath
it
a
caption
gave
the
name
of
jimmie
davis
and
a
list
of
his
scholastical
achievements
penny
stared
at
the
picture
in
disbelief
no
wonder
betty
acted
as
she
did
she
told
herself
excitedly
now
i
understand
perfectly
why
she
did
want
me
to
see
the
photograph
chapter
xvi
a
valuable
photograph
convinced
that
she
had
made
an
important
discovery
penny
hastily
left
the
street
car
catching
one
which
was
going
in
the
opposite
direction
she
went
directly
to
her
father
main
downtown
office
has
dad
left
town
yet
she
inquired
of
miss
arrow
yes
i
think
he
has
the
secretary
informed
at
least
he
left
here
nearly
an
hour
ago
and
said
he
likely
would
return
today
thinking
that
possibly
nichols
might
have
stopped
for
a
few
minutes
at
his
temporary
office
opposite
the
brunner
garage
penny
went
there
she
found
the
room
closed
though
not
locked
i
do
know
what
to
do
now
penny
thought
slightly
bewildered
it
seems
to
me
i
have
a
valuable
clue
which
should
be
acted
upon
at
once
she
considered
taking
miss
arrow
or
one
of
her
father
detectives
into
her
confidence
yet
hesitated
to
do
so
lest
she
make
herself
appear
ridiculous
after
all
she
had
no
real
evidence
upon
which
to
base
her
theory
even
though
the
photograph
of
jimmie
davis
had
given
her
a
start
she
could
not
be
certain
that
she
knew
anything
damaging
concerning
the
boy
past
it
would
be
wise
to
move
cautiously
i
say
nothing
about
the
photograph
until
i
had
an
opportunity
to
do
a
little
investigating
of
my
own
she
decided
i
may
as
well
start
by
asking
jerome
davis
a
few
questions
penny
was
familiar
with
the
policeman
regular
beat
but
before
trying
to
locate
him
she
went
home
for
her
car
it
was
afternoon
off
so
there
was
no
need
to
explain
to
the
housekeeper
where
she
was
going
i
might
leave
a
note
where
she
find
it
when
she
returns
penny
thought
still
i
should
be
back
by
supper
time
as
penny
backed
from
the
garage
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
joe
familiar
black
coupé
parked
across
the
street
i
afraid
dad
gasoline
bill
will
take
a
big
jump
upward
today
she
chuckled
penny
dismissed
the
detective
from
her
mind
and
became
intent
upon
the
problem
which
faced
her
she
must
be
very
cautious
if
she
questioned
jerome
davis
for
it
might
ruin
all
her
plans
if
he
suspected
what
she
was
about
approaching
the
policeman
usual
haunts
penny
slowed
down
presently
she
caught
sight
of
the
officer
at
a
street
corner
he
was
talking
with
someone
why
it
jerry
barrows
she
exclaimed
pulling
up
at
the
curbing
to
watch
the
plot
thickens
penny
made
no
attempt
to
interrupt
the
two
the
policeman
was
talking
so
earnestly
with
the
boy
that
he
had
not
even
glanced
in
her
direction
she
was
too
far
away
to
hear
what
they
were
saying
but
she
observed
jerome
davis
take
a
small
roll
of
bills
from
his
pocket
he
peeled
off
three
and
gave
them
to
the
youth
the
latter
thanked
him
and
moved
quickly
away
i
ca
question
davis
now
or
he
would
be
suspicious
penny
thought
i
come
back
a
little
later
recalling
that
she
had
never
visited
the
brunner
garage
to
request
jerry
barrows
address
from
the
manager
she
made
that
her
next
stop
as
she
parked
outside
the
building
she
noticed
that
joe
franey
faithful
to
his
trust
was
still
following
poor
man
he
must
think
i
am
completely
crazy
penny
laughed
perhaps
i
am
too
upon
requesting
to
see
brunner
she
was
informed
that
he
was
busy
she
was
forced
to
wait
nearly
of
an
hour
before
he
would
see
her
what
can
i
do
for
you
miss
nichols
he
inquired
with
forced
politeness
as
she
entered
penny
reminded
him
of
his
promise
oh
yes
he
laughed
apologetically
you
know
the
matter
completely
slipped
my
mind
until
this
minute
indeed
penny
inquired
she
had
not
been
surprised
at
the
answer
if
you
will
come
back
in
a
few
days
ca
you
get
the
address
for
me
now
it
is
rather
important
that
i
have
it
immediately
the
manager
frowned
i
see
what
i
can
do
wait
here
he
left
the
office
returning
a
few
minutes
later
i
ca
seem
to
find
it
on
our
records
at
all
miss
nichols
the
boy
never
worked
here
steadily
in
fact
he
has
been
discharged
so
you
refuse
to
give
me
the
address
it
is
that
miss
nichols
we
be
glad
to
provide
it
if
we
could
unfortunately
we
ca
i
see
penny
returned
coldly
she
left
the
garage
and
went
back
to
her
car
for
a
time
she
sat
thinking
she
could
not
make
up
her
mind
as
to
her
next
move
while
she
sat
debating
george
brunner
came
out
of
the
building
without
noticing
penny
he
climbed
into
his
automobile
one
of
the
latest
and
most
expensive
models
available
and
drove
away
i
wonder
where
he
going
in
such
a
hurry
penny
asked
herself
she
decided
that
it
might
be
worth
her
time
to
follow
quickly
she
shifted
gears
and
took
after
him
without
being
aware
that
anyone
was
trailing
him
the
garage
manager
weaved
from
one
street
to
another
gradually
traveling
toward
the
poorer
section
of
the
city
penny
had
difficulty
in
keeping
him
in
sight
what
a
silly
thing
i
am
doing
she
told
herself
i
think
i
sign
off
and
go
home
however
she
could
not
resist
following
the
car
a
few
more
blocks
her
patience
was
rewarded
presently
brunner
turned
into
south
lake
street
i
keep
on
a
little
farther
penny
decided
it
may
be
that
brunner
is
perfectly
honest
and
above
board
but
i
have
my
doubts
i
think
he
bear
watching
she
was
not
greatly
surprised
when
the
garage
manager
halted
his
car
only
a
short
distance
from
the
tire
shop
which
she
and
susan
had
visited
only
a
few
days
previously
penny
drew
up
to
the
curbing
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
as
brunner
alighted
and
looked
carefully
about
to
see
that
he
was
unobserved
penny
ducked
down
out
of
sight
pretending
to
be
fixing
something
on
the
floor
of
the
car
straightening
up
a
minute
later
she
saw
that
the
garage
manager
was
making
his
way
toward
the
tire
shop
now
what
does
he
want
there
she
asked
herself
i
must
say
he
keeping
very
good
company
brunner
entered
the
shop
and
penny
settled
herself
to
wait
an
hour
passed
it
began
to
grow
dark
i
really
should
telephone
gallup
that
i
be
late
for
supper
penny
reflected
either
that
or
i
should
give
up
this
silly
chase
and
go
home
in
her
heart
she
did
not
really
think
that
it
was
silly
the
conviction
had
steadily
grown
in
her
mind
that
in
some
way
the
garage
owner
was
involved
with
jerry
barrows
and
others
in
a
questionable
business
activity
noticing
a
drug
store
nearby
she
stepped
inside
to
telephone
her
home
after
several
rings
the
operator
informed
her
that
no
one
answered
gallup
must
have
been
detained
penny
thought
i
not
need
to
hurry
home
now
as
she
was
leaving
the
drug
store
the
door
of
the
tire
shop
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
opened
and
george
brunner
emerged
penny
hastily
dodged
back
into
the
doorway
to
avoid
being
seen
brunner
walked
directly
to
his
car
preparing
to
depart
before
he
could
start
the
motor
the
owner
of
the
shop
came
running
after
him
it
was
the
same
man
who
had
spoken
so
harshly
to
penny
upon
her
previous
visit
the
two
men
conversed
in
low
tones
for
several
minutes
but
as
they
became
more
excited
their
voices
grew
louder
it
too
dangerous
i
tell
you
she
heard
the
owner
of
the
tire
shop
say
the
police
are
getting
wise
and
only
a
day
or
so
ago
nichols
sent
his
daughter
around
here
to
spy
i
deal
with
her
brunner
promised
she
getting
too
curious
for
her
own
good
after
tonight
i
through
the
other
insisted
the
little
i
make
is
worth
the
risk
i
take
penny
could
not
hear
brunner
reply
he
seemed
to
be
arguing
with
the
tire
shop
owner
she
felt
elated
and
excited
at
the
information
she
had
gleaned
the
words
burned
into
her
mind
what
coup
were
the
two
men
planning
for
that
evening
if
only
she
might
learn
could
it
be
that
brunner
was
involved
in
the
auto
accessory
thefts
it
was
generally
believed
that
the
disreputable
owner
of
the
tire
shop
made
a
practice
of
receiving
stolen
goods
why
then
should
a
man
in
brunner
position
stoop
to
have
dealings
with
such
a
person
unless
he
too
were
guilty
the
evidence
against
the
two
was
purely
circumstantial
that
penny
plainly
realized
it
seemed
ridiculous
to
connect
brunner
with
the
underworld
and
yet
the
very
fact
that
no
suspicion
had
ever
been
attached
to
him
offered
a
measure
of
safety
for
his
dishonorable
activities
dad
warned
me
that
one
must
move
cautiously
in
trying
to
gather
evidence
against
influential
citizens
penny
reasoned
yet
if
i
wait
until
i
can
talk
it
over
with
him
it
may
be
too
late
brunner
automobile
was
moving
away
from
the
curbing
penny
did
not
have
a
minute
to
debate
the
instant
that
the
tire
shop
owner
vanished
inside
his
store
she
darted
to
her
own
car
already
brunner
was
far
up
the
street
but
by
speeding
she
managed
to
approach
close
enough
to
keep
him
within
sight
perhaps
i
better
take
joe
into
my
confidence
she
thought
a
trifle
uneasily
there
no
telling
where
this
chase
may
end
she
glanced
back
but
the
detective
familiar
black
coupé
was
not
in
view
nor
did
she
see
it
when
she
looked
again
a
few
blocks
farther
on
i
lost
him
somewhere
she
told
herself
in
annoyance
if
that
is
my
luck
just
when
i
might
have
used
him
to
advantage
penny
soon
discovered
that
george
brunner
was
returning
to
his
own
garage
as
he
drove
into
the
building
she
drew
up
at
the
curbing
puzzled
as
to
how
she
could
shadow
him
further
then
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
was
directly
opposite
her
office
from
there
it
would
be
a
simple
matter
to
keep
watch
of
the
brunner
garage
without
attracting
attention
to
her
own
actions
before
taking
up
her
station
in
the
little
room
high
above
the
street
penny
fortified
herself
with
several
sandwiches
and
a
bottle
of
milk
purchased
at
a
café
nearby
then
she
was
ready
for
her
vigil
an
hour
passed
and
nothing
happened
there
was
little
activity
at
the
brunner
garage
several
motorists
stopped
at
the
red
pump
for
gasoline
but
that
was
all
perhaps
my
hunch
was
wrong
penny
thought
as
she
grew
tired
of
waiting
i
really
have
much
reason
for
being
suspicious
of
brunner
after
a
time
she
used
her
father
telephone
to
call
home
no
one
answered
obviously
gallup
had
not
returned
i
wonder
what
detained
her
penny
mused
it
is
like
her
to
stay
away
she
remained
at
her
seat
by
the
window
several
times
she
was
tempted
to
pick
up
a
magazine
and
read
for
a
few
minutes
she
resisted
the
impulse
remembering
that
she
had
heard
her
father
say
that
a
good
investigator
never
took
his
eye
from
the
place
or
person
he
was
watching
another
hour
dragged
by
penny
grew
tired
and
bored
it
was
a
warm
night
and
the
tiny
room
had
become
oppressive
i
wait
a
little
while
longer
she
decided
penny
ate
the
last
of
her
sandwiches
and
wished
that
she
had
bought
coffee
instead
of
milk
it
would
have
helped
her
to
stay
awake
suddenly
she
became
alert
a
man
stood
in
the
doorway
of
the
brunner
garage
alley
entrance
she
did
not
need
her
father
field
glass
to
see
that
it
was
the
manager
he
looked
at
his
watch
then
cast
a
glance
up
and
down
the
street
penny
studied
her
own
wrist
watch
it
was
exactly
ten
a
garage
service
car
rolled
swiftly
down
the
street
it
swerved
into
the
alley
simultaneously
brunner
swung
wide
the
rear
doors
of
the
garage
the
truck
drove
in
but
not
before
penny
had
riveted
her
eyes
upon
the
license
number
at
sight
of
the
last
three
figures
her
heart
leaped
the
numbers
were
identical
with
those
she
had
noted
upon
the
license
of
the
service
car
at
the
big
dipper
chapter
xvii
under
the
canvas
it
begins
to
look
as
if
my
hunch
might
be
correct
penny
told
herself
unless
that
truck
merely
drove
into
the
garage
for
gasoline
or
service
things
look
suspicious
she
saw
brunner
follow
the
car
into
the
building
carefully
closing
the
doors
if
everything
is
honest
and
above
board
why
did
they
use
the
alley
entrance
when
the
other
one
is
far
more
convenient
she
reflected
obviously
brunner
knew
the
car
was
coming
at
exactly
ten
too
convinced
that
she
was
on
the
verge
of
important
discoveries
penny
settled
herself
for
a
long
wait
from
her
chair
by
the
window
she
could
watch
both
the
alley
and
the
main
entrance
a
half
hour
elapsed
then
another
at
length
penny
patience
was
rewarded
the
alley
doors
swung
open
and
a
heavy
truck
which
was
covered
over
with
a
canvas
top
emerged
the
driver
wore
a
cap
and
his
head
was
bent
low
in
the
of
the
dimly
lighted
street
penny
could
not
catch
even
a
glimpse
of
his
face
i
must
follow
that
truck
she
thought
tensely
if
dad
were
here
he
would
do
it
i
feel
sure
it
the
only
chance
to
gain
real
evidence
she
waited
at
the
window
only
long
enough
to
see
that
the
car
had
turned
down
center
avenue
scribbling
a
brief
message
to
her
father
explaining
what
she
intended
to
do
she
left
the
note
where
he
would
find
it
in
the
event
he
returned
to
the
office
that
night
then
she
raced
to
the
street
by
the
time
she
had
her
roadster
started
the
covered
truck
had
disappeared
however
turning
down
center
avenue
penny
caught
it
at
the
first
traffic
light
satisfied
that
she
would
have
no
trouble
in
keeping
it
in
view
she
slowed
down
falling
back
to
a
distance
which
was
not
likely
to
arouse
suspicion
penny
had
no
idea
where
the
chase
would
lead
although
the
truck
seemed
to
be
driving
directly
out
of
the
city
from
the
slow
rate
of
speed
at
which
it
traveled
she
thought
that
it
must
be
heavily
loaded
with
cargo
if
i
only
knew
what
was
hidden
under
that
canvas
cover
i
might
have
the
solution
to
the
mystery
she
reflected
i
think
i
have
it
anyway
but
i
must
secure
definite
evidence
penny
was
fully
aware
that
she
had
launched
herself
upon
a
dangerous
enterprise
in
some
manner
joe
franey
had
lost
track
of
her
completely
and
she
could
no
longer
count
upon
his
protection
in
an
emergency
she
must
depend
entirely
upon
her
own
resources
before
penny
had
traveled
many
miles
out
of
the
city
she
began
to
grow
alarmed
because
her
gasoline
gauge
showed
that
she
had
scarcely
a
gallon
left
although
she
had
her
purse
with
her
it
contained
only
a
dollar
she
could
buy
about
five
gallons
of
fuel
but
should
the
truck
lead
her
much
farther
into
the
country
she
easily
might
find
herself
stranded
apparently
the
driver
ahead
faced
a
similar
need
for
gasoline
at
the
next
filling
station
he
turned
in
penny
determined
upon
a
bold
move
at
the
risk
of
detection
she
too
drove
into
the
station
this
will
give
me
just
the
opportunity
i
need
to
get
a
good
look
at
that
driver
she
thought
the
truck
had
pulled
up
alongside
of
one
of
the
three
pumps
but
as
penny
stopped
in
the
shadow
where
the
light
from
the
filling
station
office
would
not
shine
fully
upon
her
she
was
disappointed
to
see
that
the
driver
seat
was
empty
he
gone
off
somewhere
she
told
herself
if
only
i
could
be
sure
he
be
away
for
a
minute
or
two
i
peep
under
that
canvas
cover
and
see
what
it
is
he
hauling
before
she
could
transfer
the
thought
into
action
a
filling
station
attendant
came
to
serve
her
how
many
he
inquired
three
gallons
penny
said
while
the
attendant
operated
the
pump
she
looked
searchingly
about
the
driver
of
the
truck
was
talking
with
someone
inside
the
office
but
his
back
was
turned
so
that
she
could
not
see
his
face
cents
the
attendant
informed
politely
shall
i
look
at
your
oil
it
all
right
i
think
penny
responded
offering
the
money
the
man
went
inside
for
change
this
is
my
only
chance
penny
told
herself
like
a
flash
she
was
out
of
the
roadster
she
moved
swiftly
to
the
back
of
the
truck
cast
a
quick
glance
toward
the
office
and
seeing
that
she
was
unobserved
lifted
a
corner
of
the
canvas
cover
the
truck
was
loaded
with
automobile
wheels
a
sound
from
the
direction
of
the
filling
station
office
caused
penny
to
wheel
the
driver
was
coming
back
she
dropped
the
canvas
flap
and
melted
back
into
the
shadow
she
pretended
to
busy
herself
with
the
radiator
cap
of
her
own
car
everything
okay
sir
the
station
attendant
asked
emerging
from
the
office
and
addressing
the
truck
driver
yes
what
do
i
owe
penny
started
as
she
heard
the
voice
it
was
strangely
familiar
if
only
she
could
see
the
driver
face
the
attendant
informed
the
trucker
in
response
to
his
question
the
driver
gave
him
a
bill
and
waited
for
his
change
for
the
first
time
he
turned
toward
penny
she
hastily
averted
her
face
yet
looked
over
her
shoulder
an
instant
later
to
view
his
it
jerry
barrows
she
recognized
now
i
understand
in
what
capacity
he
was
employed
by
brunner
the
attendant
had
returned
with
the
driver
change
and
likewise
her
own
he
noticed
that
she
had
removed
the
radiator
cap
from
the
roadster
need
water
he
questioned
pleasantly
please
penny
said
very
low
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
jerry
barrows
turned
but
he
saw
nothing
more
than
penny
back
apparently
satisfied
that
he
had
never
seen
the
girl
before
he
climbed
into
his
truck
the
attendant
had
peered
down
into
the
radiator
of
penny
car
it
full
to
the
top
he
reported
why
so
it
is
penny
acknowledged
with
a
laugh
i
guess
i
did
look
very
well
she
stepped
into
the
roadster
but
spent
several
minutes
putting
away
her
change
and
starting
the
motor
she
did
not
wish
to
pull
away
from
the
station
until
after
jerry
barrows
had
left
i
intend
to
find
out
where
he
taking
those
stolen
wheels
before
i
turn
back
she
decided
grimly
after
a
seemingly
interminable
delay
the
boy
started
his
truck
and
pulled
out
of
the
station
penny
waited
a
few
minutes
longer
and
then
followed
for
some
time
they
traveled
over
a
wide
national
highway
but
presently
the
truck
driver
turned
into
a
dirt
road
which
wound
in
and
out
through
the
low
hills
several
times
penny
was
forced
to
stop
her
car
and
wait
by
the
roadside
lest
she
draw
too
close
to
the
vehicle
ahead
the
trail
led
through
a
dense
forest
farm
houses
became
farther
and
farther
apart
after
awhile
they
crossed
a
river
and
directly
beyond
penny
noticed
an
odd
wooden
structure
which
appeared
to
be
a
rebuilt
sawmill
the
truck
turned
into
a
narrow
lane
which
led
to
the
old
building
penny
hesitated
to
follow
lest
the
driver
discover
that
he
was
being
shadowed
she
parked
her
car
in
a
clump
of
bushes
just
off
the
road
since
leaving
the
main
highway
she
had
traveled
without
headlights
the
truck
drew
up
near
the
sawmill
penny
could
hear
the
roar
of
the
powerful
engine
and
see
the
headlight
beam
then
the
lights
were
switched
off
and
the
sound
of
the
motor
became
muffled
he
driven
inside
the
building
she
decided
unless
i
get
in
there
somehow
i
never
discover
what
is
going
on
penny
debated
but
in
the
end
curiosity
conquered
fear
she
left
the
roadster
and
stealthily
made
her
way
toward
the
sawmill
chapter
xviii
at
the
old
sawmill
from
the
outside
penny
could
not
have
told
that
the
old
mill
was
in
use
it
was
surrounded
by
unkempt
trees
and
shrubs
which
hid
it
from
the
road
cracks
in
the
decaying
boards
had
been
carefully
patched
so
that
no
light
from
inside
could
show
through
keeping
behind
the
bushes
penny
made
a
complete
tour
of
the
building
she
could
find
no
means
of
entrance
other
than
the
main
double
doors
through
which
the
truck
had
driven
only
after
a
second
minute
inspection
did
she
notice
a
small
window
at
the
rear
well
above
the
level
of
her
head
if
i
can
get
up
there
i
might
be
able
to
see
what
is
going
on
inside
she
thought
even
on
tiptoe
she
could
not
reach
the
window
going
down
to
the
river
she
found
an
old
orange
crate
which
had
washed
up
on
the
bank
carrying
it
back
to
the
window
she
set
it
underneath
and
climbed
up
she
peered
into
the
building
the
window
opened
directly
into
a
dark
deserted
little
room
but
directly
beyond
she
could
observe
several
men
moving
about
it
was
impossible
to
see
what
they
were
doing
thinking
that
perhaps
she
might
overhear
their
conversation
she
pried
at
the
window
to
her
surprise
it
was
readily
raised
but
she
could
hear
only
a
low
murmur
of
voices
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
a
single
phrase
i
might
just
as
well
be
a
million
miles
away
as
here
she
told
herself
i
have
a
notion
to
climb
inside
penny
took
after
her
father
in
that
she
seldom
experienced
the
sensation
of
fear
she
knew
well
enough
that
she
was
taking
a
grave
risk
in
entering
the
building
yet
if
she
were
to
learn
anything
which
would
aid
nichols
in
his
case
against
the
automobile
accessory
thieves
she
must
be
courageous
naturally
agile
penny
raised
herself
to
the
ledge
by
sheer
strength
of
her
arms
she
hesitated
an
instant
then
dropped
lightly
down
inside
the
sawmill
she
moved
a
few
steps
forward
then
returned
to
quietly
close
the
window
while
it
cut
off
her
escape
she
realized
that
the
open
window
would
be
a
telltale
sign
should
anyone
notice
it
she
crept
toward
the
adjoining
main
room
from
whence
came
the
low
murmur
of
voices
secreting
herself
behind
a
tall
pile
of
old
sawed
boards
she
peered
through
the
doorway
the
truck
had
pulled
up
at
one
side
of
the
room
several
rough
looking
men
were
engaged
in
unloading
the
wheels
penny
eyes
fastened
upon
the
man
who
directed
the
others
it
was
rap
molberg
get
a
move
on
he
ordered
tersely
we
ca
stall
around
all
night
the
wheels
were
trundled
out
one
by
one
from
the
rear
end
of
the
truck
and
the
men
six
in
all
fell
to
work
with
their
tools
defacing
the
serial
numbers
and
substituting
others
penny
watched
in
fascination
her
gaze
wandered
to
jerry
barrows
who
had
driven
the
truck
to
the
sawmill
he
sat
apart
apparently
taking
no
interest
in
what
was
going
on
somewhere
in
the
building
a
telephone
rang
as
one
of
the
men
came
toward
her
penny
shrank
down
behind
the
pile
of
lumber
he
passed
so
close
that
she
could
have
reached
out
and
touched
him
had
she
chosen
the
man
went
into
a
small
anteroom
and
penny
heard
him
answer
the
telephone
she
could
not
distinguish
the
words
but
presently
he
returned
to
the
main
room
it
was
the
big
boss
he
reported
to
rap
molberg
he
called
from
somm
center
what
he
doing
there
rap
demanded
irritably
does
he
think
capable
of
handling
this
end
he
on
his
way
here
now
the
other
informed
he
says
he
has
a
hot
tip
that
christopher
nichols
is
wise
to
our
hideout
that
snooper
molberg
snarled
i
should
have
known
he
was
up
to
something
when
he
left
town
so
suddenly
the
cops
may
be
down
on
us
any
minute
then
we
getting
out
of
here
without
leaving
any
evidence
behind
molberg
snapped
get
busy
men
all
fell
to
work
with
a
will
save
jerry
barrows
you
rap
shouted
angrily
this
is
no
time
for
loafing
i
agreed
to
drive
a
truck
but
i
did
say
i
deface
tires
and
help
with
your
thieving
the
boy
retorted
bitterly
i
sick
and
tired
of
the
whole
deal
oh
so
you
sick
and
tired
of
it
are
you
the
other
echoed
sarcastically
you
in
this
the
same
as
the
rest
of
us
and
if
we
go
to
the
pen
you
go
with
us
now
get
to
work
or
i
he
left
the
threat
unsaid
for
just
then
an
automobile
engine
was
heard
outside
the
building
everyone
froze
in
an
attitude
of
listening
molberg
dropped
his
tools
and
ran
to
peer
out
through
a
tiny
in
the
wall
it
all
right
he
said
in
relief
it
the
boss
he
must
have
burned
up
the
road
getting
here
from
somm
center
the
wide
doors
were
flung
open
and
a
motor
car
drove
into
the
building
george
brunner
alighted
there
no
time
to
waste
he
informed
tersely
load
up
those
wheels
and
get
them
out
of
here
we
have
finished
defacing
the
numbers
molberg
told
him
we
ca
stop
for
that
the
important
thing
is
to
get
this
place
cleared
of
evidence
before
the
police
pounce
down
on
us
quickly
the
wheels
which
had
been
unloaded
were
stacked
back
into
the
truck
brunner
turned
sharply
upon
jerry
barrows
there
your
load
he
snapped
get
going
with
it
the
boy
made
no
move
to
obey
did
you
hear
brunner
snarled
i
heard
jerry
barrows
retorted
coldly
but
i
not
driving
that
truck
out
of
here
tonight
i
through
we
see
about
that
brunner
came
toward
him
menacingly
the
boy
cringed
in
terror
but
stood
his
ground
i
been
thinking
it
over
he
said
determinedly
i
rather
go
to
jail
than
keep
on
as
i
have
i
driven
my
last
truck
load
of
stolen
wheels
brunner
caught
him
roughly
by
the
shoulder
you
yellow
he
sneered
but
i
know
how
to
handle
your
kind
i
just
let
your
father
hear
that
his
son
has
become
a
thief
how
will
you
like
that
all
color
had
drained
from
the
boy
face
in
the
light
from
the
workmen
torches
it
appeared
almost
ghostly
you
know
it
will
just
about
kill
my
father
if
he
learns
the
truth
then
you
do
as
i
say
the
boy
hesitated
seemingly
almost
on
the
verge
of
giving
in
then
he
threw
back
his
head
defiantly
no
i
made
up
my
mind
i
through
for
good
that
your
final
decision
it
is
without
warning
brunner
fist
shot
out
he
struck
the
boy
squarely
under
the
chin
jerry
barrows
knees
crumpled
beneath
him
and
he
sagged
to
the
floor
brunner
turned
to
the
others
who
stood
watching
anyone
here
who
feels
the
same
way
no
one
spoke
then
back
to
your
work
brunner
commanded
clear
the
building
of
every
scrap
of
evidence
penny
was
horrified
at
the
scene
she
had
witnessed
jerry
barrows
lay
so
motionless
upon
the
floor
that
she
was
afraid
he
had
been
seriously
injured
she
longed
to
go
to
his
aid
yet
dared
not
make
a
move
lest
she
betray
her
presence
if
only
i
could
get
word
to
the
police
or
to
father
she
thought
tensely
by
the
time
i
drive
back
to
belton
city
for
help
it
will
be
too
late
the
telephone
if
she
could
but
reach
the
antechamber
it
might
be
possible
to
notify
the
authorities
watching
her
chance
she
tiptoed
across
the
open
space
to
the
little
room
the
men
were
so
occupied
with
their
work
that
they
did
not
glance
in
her
direction
no
sound
betrayed
her
penny
reached
the
chamber
in
safety
and
quietly
closed
the
door
it
was
dark
inside
and
at
first
she
could
not
locate
the
telephone
but
after
groping
about
she
found
it
on
the
wall
i
try
father
office
she
decided
there
just
a
chance
that
he
may
have
returned
her
hand
trembled
as
she
took
down
the
receiver
she
was
fully
aware
of
the
risk
she
was
taking
in
attempting
the
telephone
call
muffling
her
voice
and
speaking
very
low
she
gave
the
number
of
her
father
office
to
the
operator
there
was
a
long
wait
she
could
hear
a
rhythmical
buzz
on
the
wire
the
bell
was
ringing
but
no
one
answered
i
must
try
the
police
penny
thought
just
then
she
heard
a
click
at
the
other
end
of
the
line
a
receiver
had
been
taken
from
its
hook
hello
christopher
nichols
speaking
acknowledged
the
familiar
voice
of
her
father
in
her
excitement
penny
began
an
almost
incoherent
outpouring
of
what
she
had
witnessed
you
say
you
seen
the
tire
thieves
at
work
nichols
demanded
yes
bring
the
police
and
they
can
be
trapped
with
the
evidence
but
hurry
or
it
will
be
too
late
where
are
you
now
penny
her
father
questioned
tensely
at
the
old
sawmill
take
the
road
a
slight
sound
directly
behind
caused
penny
to
turn
her
head
rap
molberg
stood
in
the
doorway
chapter
xix
trapped
before
penny
could
utter
a
sound
the
man
sprang
toward
her
a
grimy
hand
was
clapped
roughly
against
her
mouth
and
the
telephone
receiver
jerked
from
her
hand
well
if
it
is
the
little
nichols
girl
the
man
leered
shoving
her
away
from
the
trying
to
bring
the
police
down
on
us
were
you
penny
could
make
no
retort
instead
she
savagely
bit
his
hand
with
a
cry
of
rage
and
pain
molberg
jerked
it
away
penny
sprang
for
the
door
the
man
leaped
after
her
catching
her
by
the
shoulder
he
pressed
her
back
against
the
wall
no
more
of
your
little
tricks
he
warned
from
his
pocket
he
drew
forth
a
stout
cord
although
penny
struggled
she
could
not
prevent
him
from
tying
her
hands
behind
her
back
he
took
out
a
large
handkerchief
not
a
gag
penny
pleaded
i
suppose
you
like
to
make
another
telephone
call
the
man
said
sarcastically
i
going
to
fix
you
so
you
wo
make
any
more
trouble
tonight
the
handkerchief
was
tied
tightly
across
her
mouth
and
her
feet
were
securely
trussed
then
molberg
placed
her
with
her
back
against
the
wall
and
left
her
alone
almost
immediately
he
returned
with
brunner
the
two
had
brought
a
light
this
is
luck
the
garage
manager
declared
his
eyes
sparkling
with
christopher
nichols
daughter
in
our
hands
i
guess
that
snooper
make
us
any
more
trouble
did
she
get
through
to
the
police
do
you
think
i
doubt
it
she
had
just
begun
to
talk
on
the
when
i
caught
her
rap
informed
we
take
no
chance
anyway
we
getting
out
of
here
as
quickly
as
we
can
the
two
men
went
away
taking
the
light
with
them
penny
was
left
alone
in
the
dark
she
twisted
and
turned
but
could
not
succeed
in
loosening
her
bonds
the
gag
became
uncomfortable
what
a
mess
i
made
of
things
now
she
told
herself
in
disgust
here
i
am
a
prisoner
and
there
is
a
chance
dad
or
the
police
will
get
to
me
in
time
if
only
i
could
have
explained
where
i
was
before
rap
molberg
caught
me
penny
tried
not
to
think
of
the
possible
fate
which
awaited
her
brunner
would
never
permit
her
to
go
free
she
had
gleaned
too
much
valuable
information
and
would
prove
a
damaging
witness
against
him
she
knew
now
that
he
alone
directed
the
activities
of
the
molberg
gang
brunner
was
the
arch
criminal
the
master
mind
which
had
baffled
police
and
private
investigators
rap
molberg
although
a
dangerous
crook
merely
carried
out
his
chief
orders
brunner
fooled
everyone
with
his
posing
as
a
substantial
citizen
penny
mused
all
the
time
he
was
using
his
business
as
a
front
to
hide
his
unlawful
activities
outside
in
the
main
part
of
the
sawmill
she
could
hear
men
working
feverishly
in
a
few
minutes
the
big
truck
would
depart
with
all
the
evidence
which
could
not
be
destroyed
penny
wondered
if
she
would
be
left
tied
up
in
the
little
room
or
taken
along
again
she
struggled
to
free
herself
but
only
succeeded
in
drawing
the
knots
tighter
the
gag
was
so
tight
across
her
mouth
that
she
could
utter
no
sound
spent
from
her
effort
to
escape
she
leaned
back
against
the
wall
presently
her
eyes
riveted
upon
the
closed
door
was
it
imagination
or
had
it
opened
a
tiny
crack
distinctly
she
could
notice
a
widening
streak
of
light
she
waited
expectantly
noiselessly
the
door
swung
back
on
its
hinges
at
first
penny
could
not
see
who
it
was
that
had
come
in
but
as
he
moved
toward
her
she
recognized
jerry
barrows
do
be
afraid
he
told
her
in
a
whisper
i
come
to
help
you
penny
was
relieved
to
know
that
the
boy
had
not
been
seriously
injured
by
the
blow
he
had
received
from
brunner
she
tried
to
speak
but
could
not
quickly
he
bent
and
untied
the
cloth
about
her
mouth
why
are
you
doing
this
penny
whispered
because
you
helped
me
once
when
i
was
in
trouble
the
boy
told
her
instantly
besides
i
hate
brunner
he
has
forced
you
to
continue
in
crime
against
your
will
yes
your
real
name
is
not
jerry
barrows
penny
stated
the
boy
paused
in
untying
the
cords
about
her
wrists
no
that
is
my
own
name
he
admitted
you
are
jimmie
davis
penny
accused
the
boy
stared
how
did
you
know
from
a
photograph
you
have
told
my
father
he
demanded
nervously
no
i
said
nothing
of
it
to
anyone
but
i
think
the
only
way
out
for
you
is
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
everything
i
mean
to
tell
the
truth
if
i
ever
get
away
from
here
alive
you
testify
against
brunner
and
molberg
penny
questioned
eagerly
yes
if
we
can
manage
to
escape
the
main
door
is
guarded
i
came
in
through
a
window
penny
told
him
perhaps
we
can
get
out
the
same
way
the
instant
her
bonds
had
been
cut
she
sprang
to
her
feet
they
moved
noiselessly
to
the
door
jimmie
opened
it
a
crack
then
closed
it
hastily
penny
could
hear
footsteps
it
brunner
the
boy
whispered
i
think
he
suspects
they
braced
themselves
against
the
door
the
knob
turned
slowly
then
a
man
weight
was
hurled
against
the
panel
open
that
door
brunner
shouted
furiously
open
or
i
break
it
down
there
was
no
escape
from
the
room
for
it
was
without
windows
penny
and
her
companion
held
the
door
as
long
as
they
could
but
when
rap
molberg
had
come
in
response
to
his
chief
call
the
result
was
inevitable
a
panel
splintered
and
then
the
door
gave
way
penny
and
her
companion
retreated
against
the
wall
so
you
thought
you
help
her
escape
brunner
sneered
confronting
the
boy
i
thought
i
find
you
here
but
you
pay
for
your
treachery
jimmie
davis
he
turned
to
molberg
tersely
ordering
him
to
tie
the
arms
of
the
prisoners
as
the
man
caught
her
by
the
wrist
penny
struggled
furiously
jimmie
was
too
battered
from
his
recent
encounter
to
put
up
a
fight
he
recognized
the
futility
of
struggling
against
impossible
odds
what
shall
we
do
with
now
molberg
asked
gruffly
when
he
had
succeeded
in
overpowering
penny
this
girl
is
a
little
wildcat
if
there
ever
was
one
we
take
them
along
with
us
brunner
ordered
tersely
the
important
thing
is
to
get
away
from
here
while
the
getting
is
good
we
can
decide
the
fate
of
these
two
later
on
penny
and
her
companion
were
forced
to
walk
into
the
main
room
of
the
sawmill
they
saw
that
everything
was
in
readiness
for
a
hurried
departure
the
truck
had
been
reloaded
and
stood
waiting
by
the
door
get
in
molberg
commanded
sharply
pushing
penny
toward
the
rear
of
the
van
how
can
i
with
my
hands
tied
she
demanded
indignantly
unfasten
the
cords
instead
molberg
lifted
her
off
her
feet
dropping
her
unceremoniously
among
the
neat
stacks
of
car
wheels
with
which
the
truck
was
filled
even
less
gently
jimmie
davis
was
tossed
in
beside
her
then
the
back
end
of
the
van
was
dropped
down
and
the
canvas
cover
thrown
over
it
penny
and
her
companion
were
enveloped
in
darkness
where
are
they
taking
us
she
asked
in
a
whisper
probably
to
a
hideout
in
another
state
jimmie
informed
our
jig
is
up
unless
we
can
escape
we
may
have
a
chance
after
the
truck
starts
i
doubt
it
the
boy
returned
gloomily
we
be
watched
every
second
if
we
make
a
move
they
shoot
penny
relapsed
into
a
moody
silence
it
was
hot
and
unpleasant
in
the
covered
truck
her
arms
hurt
where
the
cords
cut
deeply
into
the
flesh
her
head
had
begun
to
ache
and
she
could
think
of
no
way
to
escape
presently
the
truck
began
to
move
from
the
manner
in
which
it
bumped
about
penny
knew
they
were
traveling
down
the
rough
side
road
to
the
main
highway
once
there
the
van
would
be
absorbed
in
the
general
stream
of
traffic
i
guess
brunner
was
right
when
he
called
me
yellow
jimmie
presently
said
in
a
low
tone
i
betrayed
my
father
my
sister
and
my
friends
i
wanted
to
go
straight
but
brunner
had
me
in
a
strangle
hold
how
do
you
mean
penny
asked
he
threatened
to
tell
my
father
the
truth
i
have
quit
working
for
him
long
ago
if
i
had
been
such
a
coward
just
what
did
you
do
for
brunner
jimmie
i
drove
the
truck
at
first
i
thought
it
was
a
legitimate
job
when
i
discovered
that
i
was
hauling
stolen
tires
i
wanted
to
quit
brunner
would
let
you
no
he
made
me
keep
on
you
see
i
was
heavily
in
debt
father
know
that
either
i
needed
the
money
the
job
brought
in
i
kept
getting
in
deeper
and
deeper
i
hated
to
disgrace
my
father
and
my
sister
i
can
understand
that
jimmie
i
did
treat
you
right
either
miss
nichols
i
lied
to
you
about
why
the
police
were
after
me
i
suspected
that
penny
acknowledged
i
was
driving
a
truck
of
stolen
wheels
to
chicago
when
i
had
a
the
boy
went
on
a
policeman
came
over
to
investigate
i
ducked
out
and
hid
in
your
garage
why
did
you
come
to
talk
with
my
father
as
you
promised
jimmie
i
knew
he
had
been
assigned
to
catch
the
auto
accessory
thieves
i
could
afford
to
take
any
chance
before
penny
could
reply
there
came
a
screech
of
brakes
as
the
truck
abruptly
stopped
she
was
flung
hard
against
the
halt
a
voice
rang
out
halt
or
we
fire
chapter
xx
penny
triumph
with
a
thrill
of
joy
penny
recognized
her
father
voice
in
some
manner
he
had
traced
her
telephone
call
and
had
brought
help
two
shots
rang
out
to
be
followed
in
quick
succession
by
others
from
the
driver
seat
of
the
truck
then
silence
penny
huddling
against
the
wall
of
the
dark
van
decided
to
take
a
chance
she
screamed
loudly
for
help
a
moment
later
the
canvas
cover
was
jerked
from
the
rear
of
the
truck
nichols
face
loomed
up
behind
the
electric
lantern
which
he
carried
penny
are
you
hurt
not
a
bit
dad
but
i
tied
up
i
have
you
out
in
a
jiffy
courage
nichols
leaped
nimbly
upon
the
truck
and
with
his
pocket
knife
severed
the
cords
which
held
her
arms
what
happened
penny
questioned
eagerly
i
heard
the
shots
the
battle
did
amount
to
much
we
outnumbered
them
two
to
one
molberg
was
wounded
in
the
leg
when
he
leaped
off
the
truck
and
took
to
the
fields
and
brunner
he
handcuffed
to
one
of
the
officers
now
how
did
you
know
where
to
come
penny
questioned
i
was
overpowered
before
i
could
give
you
directions
i
suspected
that
in
fact
i
was
worried
sick
for
fear
i
would
get
to
you
in
time
your
note
gave
me
a
faint
clue
then
i
traced
the
telephone
call
to
the
somm
center
exchange
so
i
knew
you
were
somewhere
in
this
vicinity
yesterday
we
received
an
anonymous
tip
that
an
abandoned
sawmill
near
here
would
bear
investigation
putting
two
and
two
together
i
thought
perhaps
the
gangsters
might
be
captured
there
but
you
came
so
quickly
by
plane
to
somm
center
nichols
smiled
the
police
were
waiting
for
me
at
the
field
with
automobiles
we
lost
no
time
in
bottling
up
all
the
roads
approaching
the
old
sawmill
during
the
hurried
conversation
jimmie
davis
had
remained
quiet
now
nichols
bent
over
him
who
is
this
boy
penny
it
all
right
dad
set
him
free
i
explain
everything
the
detective
cut
the
bonds
and
jimmie
stepped
down
from
the
truck
hold
on
there
a
policeman
intervened
taking
the
boy
by
the
arm
you
wanted
at
headquarters
jimmie
offered
no
resistance
handcuffs
were
slipped
over
his
wrists
oh
dad
do
let
them
do
that
penny
pleaded
he
is
really
a
criminal
who
is
this
boy
penny
the
detective
asked
again
jimmie
davis
alias
jerry
barrows
davis
not
jerome
davis
son
yes
he
is
now
i
begin
to
understand
a
few
things
which
were
clear
to
me
before
why
our
raid
failed
for
instance
i
do
believe
jerome
davis
is
implicated
with
the
gang
penny
insisted
ca
you
let
this
boy
go
free
if
it
becomes
generally
known
that
he
is
the
son
of
a
policeman
it
will
do
so
much
harm
we
ca
favor
him
on
that
account
penny
i
realize
that
but
he
innocent
at
least
his
worst
crime
was
to
drive
the
truck
which
contained
the
stolen
tires
he
only
did
that
because
brunner
threatened
him
are
you
certain
yes
i
am
i
overheard
brunner
quarreling
with
him
penny
then
began
a
rapid
account
of
all
that
she
had
witnessed
at
the
old
sawmill
several
of
the
policemen
gathered
near
to
hear
the
story
brunner
handcuffed
to
an
officer
listened
intently
to
her
words
it
all
a
lie
he
interrupted
this
davis
boy
is
the
son
of
an
old
friend
of
mine
because
i
thought
so
much
of
his
father
i
came
here
tonight
to
try
to
save
the
boy
from
his
own
folly
i
pleaded
with
him
to
give
up
his
career
of
crime
and
why
were
you
found
in
the
company
of
rap
molberg
nichols
questioned
severely
i
was
trying
to
think
of
some
way
never
mind
the
detective
cut
him
short
you
can
explain
it
to
the
judge
while
brunner
molberg
and
the
men
who
had
been
captured
with
them
were
being
loaded
into
police
cars
an
automobile
was
observed
coming
toward
the
lane
which
led
to
the
sawmill
block
the
road
nichols
ordered
it
may
be
more
of
the
gang
a
police
car
was
turned
crosswise
in
the
highway
the
oncoming
automobile
stopped
just
in
time
to
avoid
a
crash
officers
instantly
surrounded
the
car
penny
crowding
near
recognized
the
driver
as
jerome
davis
beside
him
crouched
his
daughter
betty
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
davis
demanded
his
eyes
swept
the
group
and
came
to
rest
upon
his
own
son
who
was
in
the
custody
of
an
officer
jimmie
he
exclaimed
his
shoulders
sagged
his
hands
fell
from
the
steering
wheel
i
see
i
am
too
late
he
murmured
betty
sprang
from
the
car
and
ran
to
her
brother
oh
jimmie
how
could
you
do
it
she
cried
brokenly
how
could
you
penny
slipped
her
arm
about
the
weeping
girl
and
led
her
away
why
did
you
come
here
tonight
betty
she
asked
gently
we
came
because
we
knew
jimmie
was
in
danger
we
thought
we
might
get
here
ahead
of
the
police
and
save
him
from
arrest
then
your
father
knows
the
truth
yes
he
suspected
for
some
weeks
that
jimmie
was
implicated
with
the
dreadful
molberg
gang
tonight
he
forced
me
to
acknowledge
it
but
how
did
you
know
betty
once
i
saw
jimmie
with
rap
molberg
at
the
blind
pig
i
realized
too
that
my
brother
was
deeply
in
debt
i
made
him
tell
me
everything
no
wonder
you
were
worried
penny
said
sympathetically
i
did
know
what
to
do
betty
went
on
nervously
i
was
afraid
to
tell
father
the
truth
because
i
thought
it
would
just
about
kill
him
he
had
pledged
himself
to
the
task
of
tracing
down
the
molberg
gang
and
of
course
if
jimmie
name
were
linked
in
any
way
with
the
automobile
thefts
it
would
have
cost
your
father
his
position
yes
i
was
afraid
too
that
father
would
insist
upon
turning
jimmie
over
to
the
police
he
is
so
upright
and
honest
he
detests
a
criminal
how
did
your
father
learn
the
truth
betty
he
guessed
it
but
at
first
said
nothing
to
me
how
long
has
he
known
since
the
night
of
the
raid
at
least
that
was
when
he
first
became
suspicious
he
thought
jimmie
had
tipped
off
the
molberg
gang
that
their
hideouts
were
to
be
raided
but
how
did
jimmie
learn
that
father
unintentionally
mentioned
it
at
the
breakfast
table
it
was
immediately
after
the
raid
that
davis
seemed
to
lose
interest
in
the
case
penny
said
musingly
yes
he
was
bewildered
by
the
turn
of
events
i
did
know
it
until
tonight
but
he
quietly
set
about
watching
jimmie
in
a
short
while
he
had
learned
the
truth
and
how
did
you
know
that
jimmie
would
be
here
tonight
penny
questioned
he
told
me
betty
admitted
for
weeks
i
have
pleaded
with
him
to
give
up
this
dreadful
life
he
has
been
leading
he
promised
me
he
would
but
he
said
there
was
a
special
reason
why
he
must
drive
the
truck
one
more
time
that
was
because
the
leader
of
the
gang
had
threatened
to
tell
davis
penny
commented
anyway
tonight
father
forced
me
to
admit
everything
when
he
learned
that
jimmie
would
be
at
the
old
sawmill
he
determined
to
come
here
and
try
to
save
him
from
his
own
folly
oh
miss
nichols
do
you
think
they
keep
jimmie
in
jail
not
if
i
can
prevent
it
penny
returned
firmly
come
on
i
want
you
to
repeat
to
father
what
you
just
told
me
the
girls
found
nichols
and
a
group
of
policemen
talking
with
jerome
davis
the
latter
looked
completely
discouraged
i
not
asking
you
to
believe
my
story
or
to
let
jimmie
go
free
he
said
quietly
my
son
has
broken
the
law
and
he
must
be
punished
the
same
as
any
other
offender
of
course
i
shall
resign
my
position
on
the
force
immediately
that
may
not
be
necessary
nichols
told
him
kindly
in
my
opinion
you
already
proven
that
you
had
no
hand
in
the
affair
it
was
my
fault
that
the
raid
failed
the
policeman
accused
himself
he
turned
to
his
son
jimmie
you
were
the
one
who
tipped
off
the
gang
that
it
was
to
be
staged
yes
father
the
boy
admitted
i
dropped
it
out
before
i
thought
i
did
mean
to
do
it
i
take
all
the
blame
jerome
davis
said
quietly
i
should
never
have
mentioned
the
affair
at
home
he
moved
over
to
his
son
placing
his
hand
upon
his
shoulder
for
an
instant
then
he
turned
sternly
back
to
the
group
of
officers
do
your
duty
men
he
directed
no
one
moved
it
is
right
to
arrest
this
boy
penny
declared
he
was
trying
to
go
straight
and
he
ought
to
have
a
chance
he
get
it
too
nichols
added
with
you
as
a
witness
in
his
favor
penny
i
confident
he
be
released
brunner
molberg
and
other
members
of
the
captured
gang
were
loaded
into
police
cars
and
taken
back
to
belton
city
although
technically
under
custody
jimmie
davis
rode
with
nichols
and
was
not
handcuffed
betty
and
her
father
took
penny
home
since
nichols
found
it
necessary
to
go
to
the
police
station
i
ca
thank
you
enough
for
all
you
done
betty
said
gratefully
as
penny
alighted
at
her
own
doorstep
if
jimmie
does
go
free
it
will
be
entirely
through
your
efforts
and
your
father
i
think
everything
will
come
out
right
penny
told
her
encouragingly
if
there
any
news
i
let
you
know
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
as
the
car
drove
away
gallup
rushed
out
of
the
house
to
embrace
the
girl
penny
what
has
happened
she
cried
your
clothes
are
dirty
and
mussed
you
a
sight
i
do
doubt
it
penny
laughed
i
had
a
wild
night
i
did
get
home
until
an
hour
ago
gallup
explained
when
i
found
you
were
here
i
was
frantic
i
was
afraid
you
might
have
been
kidnapped
again
rap
molberg
wo
trouble
me
after
this
gallup
he
spending
the
night
in
jail
she
then
gave
a
glowing
account
of
the
capture
at
the
somm
center
sawmill
the
details
left
the
housekeeper
dumbfounded
penny
nichols
it
plain
to
see
you
going
to
take
after
your
father
she
sighed
one
detective
in
the
family
is
bad
enough
it
was
the
most
exciting
experience
of
my
life
penny
declared
her
eyes
gleaming
i
suppose
i
shall
never
have
another
like
it
in
such
a
prediction
she
was
entirely
mistaken
without
the
power
to
look
into
the
future
she
could
not
know
that
an
adventure
of
far
different
character
though
even
more
thrilling
awaited
her
mystery
of
the
lost
the
second
volume
in
the
penny
nichols
series
relates
her
escapades
at
raven
ridge
events
had
moved
with
such
rapidity
that
until
gallup
brought
a
tray
of
steaming
food
from
the
kitchen
and
set
it
before
her
penny
had
not
realized
how
very
hungry
she
was
she
had
just
finished
the
supper
when
nichols
came
home
what
news
penny
asked
eagerly
brunner
and
molberg
are
both
behind
bars
where
they
belong
her
father
reported
brunner
is
trying
to
raise
bail
and
may
get
out
by
morning
oh
then
he
may
escape
the
law
after
all
no
danger
of
that
penny
he
be
watched
from
the
instant
he
leaves
the
jail
and
kept
in
sight
until
he
appears
for
trial
do
you
think
he
will
be
convicted
i
feel
sure
of
it
if
you
testify
against
him
he
has
a
chance
will
you
mind
going
to
court
i
love
it
penny
returned
instantly
nothing
would
give
me
greater
satisfaction
than
to
serve
as
a
witness
against
both
of
those
men
brunner
was
the
real
brains
behind
the
gang
nichols
went
on
he
had
everyone
fooled
including
myself
you
did
a
fine
piece
of
work
my
dear
penny
flushed
at
the
praise
if
it
had
been
for
your
arrival
at
the
critical
moment
all
my
information
would
have
been
worthless
i
guess
i
was
very
foolhardy
perhaps
you
were
a
trifle
the
detective
smiled
but
an
investigator
must
take
certain
chances
not
that
i
want
you
to
do
the
same
thing
again
he
added
hastily
you
did
tell
me
what
the
police
did
about
jimmie
davis
penny
reminded
him
i
hope
he
was
sent
to
jail
too
no
he
been
placed
in
the
custody
of
his
father
for
a
year
if
he
straightens
up
and
does
violate
his
parole
nothing
more
will
ever
be
said
regarding
his
part
in
the
affair
oh
i
so
glad
i
knew
you
arrange
it
that
way
it
was
entirely
due
to
my
efforts
the
detective
insisted
the
boy
really
is
bad
at
heart
the
way
he
came
to
your
rescue
proved
that
this
will
mean
so
much
to
betty
and
her
father
penny
declared
happily
her
face
clouded
i
suppose
nothing
can
save
position
on
the
force
quite
the
contrary
nichols
smiled
it
is
already
arranged
that
he
shall
keep
his
job
but
the
newspaper
publicity
there
will
be
none
at
least
not
regarding
davis
and
his
son
it
was
long
after
midnight
when
penny
went
to
bed
she
was
so
tired
and
worn
that
she
did
not
awaken
until
gallup
rapped
several
times
upon
her
door
what
time
is
it
penny
inquired
drowsily
nearly
noon
the
housekeeper
reported
i
should
have
awakened
you
only
the
telephone
has
been
ringing
all
morning
and
the
yard
is
cluttered
with
newspaper
men
i
be
right
down
penny
laughed
springing
out
of
bed
it
was
a
new
experience
for
her
to
find
herself
occupying
the
limelight
she
enjoyed
talking
with
the
reporters
but
took
care
to
reveal
nothing
which
involved
either
davis
or
his
son
the
morning
papers
played
up
the
story
of
the
capture
and
penny
photograph
dug
up
from
the
morgue
appeared
upon
the
front
page
she
was
studying
it
with
mingled
feelings
of
pleasure
and
disappointment
when
susan
altman
burst
in
upon
her
congratulations
she
beamed
i
see
by
the
morning
paper
that
you
are
famous
did
you
ever
see
such
a
horrible
picture
penny
complained
three
years
old
at
least
why
i
look
positively
juvenile
where
the
editor
found
it
i
do
know
you
should
worry
about
such
a
trifle
as
that
susan
scoffed
tell
me
the
entire
story
there
nothing
to
report
except
what
in
the
paper
penny
replied
although
she
longed
to
relate
the
part
which
jimmie
had
played
she
wisely
refrained
from
mentioning
his
name
if
he
were
to
have
his
opportunity
to
begin
life
anew
the
past
must
be
forgotten
for
days
penny
found
herself
besieged
by
friends
and
acquaintances
who
were
eager
to
learn
all
the
details
of
her
adventure
when
she
walked
downtown
she
was
gazed
upon
with
awe
and
admiration
at
the
trial
of
rap
molberg
and
george
brunner
she
appeared
as
the
state
star
witness
the
garage
owner
well
fortified
with
dishonestly
acquired
money
had
employed
one
of
the
best
criminal
lawyers
in
the
state
to
defend
him
penny
was
put
through
a
severe
test
when
she
took
the
stand
but
although
nervous
she
answered
all
questions
calmly
and
clearly
her
testimony
was
largely
responsible
for
the
conviction
of
both
rap
molberg
and
brunner
the
two
were
ordered
confined
to
the
state
penitentiary
for
a
long
term
of
years
nichols
was
jubilant
at
the
result
of
the
trial
this
definitely
clears
up
the
case
he
declared
and
i
think
it
calls
for
a
big
celebration
the
victory
event
took
the
form
of
a
gala
dinner
at
belton
leading
hotel
penny
invited
susan
and
many
of
her
high
school
friends
in
addition
policemen
detectives
and
all
persons
who
had
aided
in
the
capture
of
the
thieves
were
present
we
will
have
no
speeches
nichols
had
promised
only
good
food
and
plenty
of
fun
penny
therefore
was
surprised
when
her
father
who
occupied
the
chair
at
the
head
of
the
table
arose
and
faced
the
expectant
group
i
do
mean
to
break
my
promise
about
speech
making
he
smiled
for
that
reason
without
any
formality
i
shall
present
to
my
daughter
penny
this
token
of
merit
from
the
officials
of
the
reliance
insurance
company
for
her
splendid
work
in
connection
with
the
molberg
case
penny
gasped
as
her
father
held
up
a
tiny
bejeweled
wrist
watch
and
placed
it
in
her
hand
it
was
the
daintiest
and
most
exquisite
timepiece
she
had
ever
seen
oh
is
it
wonderful
chorused
a
bevy
of
friends
as
they
gathered
about
it
the
nicest
thing
that
ever
happened
to
me
penny
declared
i
ca
begin
to
say
how
grateful
i
am
are
you
going
to
look
at
the
inscription
her
father
inquired
his
eyes
twinkling
in
surprise
she
glanced
down
at
the
case
her
face
flushed
read
it
aloud
commanded
her
friends
penny
was
too
confused
to
obey
for
engraved
on
the
watch
case
in
the
tiniest
of
letters
were
the
words
to
penny
nichols
for
distinguished
services
as
an
agent
of
justice
the
end
