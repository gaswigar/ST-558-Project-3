says
a
chinese
manuscript
which
my
friend
was
obliging
enough
to
read
and
explain
to
me
for
the
first
seventy
thousand
ages
ate
their
meat
raw
clawing
or
biting
it
from
the
living
animal
just
as
they
do
in
abyssinia
to
this
day
this
period
is
not
obscurely
hinted
at
by
their
great
confucius
in
the
second
chapter
of
his
mundane
mutations
where
he
designates
a
kind
of
golden
age
by
the
term
literally
the
cooks
holiday
the
manuscript
goes
on
to
say
that
the
art
of
roasting
or
rather
broiling
which
i
take
to
be
the
elder
brother
was
accidentally
discovered
in
the
manner
following
the
swineherd
having
gone
out
in
the
woods
one
morning
as
his
manner
was
to
collect
masts
for
his
hogs
left
his
cottage
in
the
care
of
his
eldest
son
a
great
lubberly
boy
who
being
fond
of
playing
with
fire
as
younkers
of
his
age
commonly
are
let
some
sparks
escape
into
a
bundle
of
straw
which
kindling
quickly
spread
the
conflagration
over
every
part
of
their
poor
mansion
till
it
was
reduced
to
ashes
together
with
the
cottage
a
sorry
antediluvian
makeshift
of
a
building
you
may
think
it
what
was
of
much
more
importance
a
fine
litter
of
pigs
no
less
than
nine
in
number
perished
china
pigs
had
been
esteemed
a
luxury
all
over
the
east
from
the
remotest
periods
that
we
read
of
was
in
the
utmost
consternation
as
you
may
think
not
so
much
for
the
sake
of
the
tenement
which
his
father
and
he
could
easily
build
up
again
with
a
few
dry
branches
and
the
labour
of
an
hour
or
two
at
any
time
as
for
the
loss
of
the
pigs
while
he
was
thinking
what
he
should
say
to
his
father
and
wringing
his
hands
over
the
smoking
remnants
of
one
of
those
untimely
sufferers
an
odour
assailed
his
nostrils
unlike
any
scent
which
he
had
before
experienced
what
could
it
proceed
from
not
from
the
burnt
cottage
he
had
smelt
that
smell
before
indeed
this
was
by
no
means
the
first
accident
of
the
kind
which
had
occured
through
the
negligence
of
this
unlucky
young
firebrand
much
less
did
it
resemble
that
of
any
known
herb
weed
or
flower
a
premonitory
moistening
at
the
same
time
overflowed
his
nether
lip
he
knew
not
what
to
think
he
next
stooped
down
to
feel
the
pig
if
there
were
any
signs
of
life
in
it
he
burnt
his
fingers
and
to
cool
them
he
applied
them
in
his
booby
fashion
to
his
mouth
some
of
the
crumbs
of
the
scorched
skin
had
come
away
with
his
fingers
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
in
the
world
life
indeed
for
before
him
no
man
had
known
it
he
tasted
again
he
felt
and
fumbled
at
the
pig
it
did
not
burn
him
so
much
now
still
he
licked
his
finger
from
a
sort
of
habit
the
truth
at
length
broke
into
his
slow
understanding
that
it
was
the
pig
that
smelt
so
and
the
pig
that
tasted
so
delicious
and
surrendering
himself
up
to
the
newborn
pleasure
he
fell
to
tearing
up
whole
handfuls
of
the
scorched
skin
with
the
flesh
next
it
and
was
cramming
it
down
his
throat
in
his
beastly
fashion
when
his
sire
entered
amid
the
smoking
rafters
armed
with
retributory
cudgel
and
finding
how
affairs
stood
began
to
rain
blows
upon
the
young
shoulders
as
thick
as
hailstones
which
heeded
not
any
more
than
if
they
had
been
flies
the
tickling
pleasure
which
he
experienced
in
his
lower
regions
had
rendered
him
quite
callous
to
any
inconveniences
he
might
feel
in
those
remote
quarters
his
father
might
lay
on
but
he
could
not
beat
him
from
his
pig
till
he
had
fairly
made
an
end
of
it
when
becoming
a
little
more
sensible
of
his
situation
something
like
the
following
dialogue
ensued

is
it
not

with
horror
he
cursed
his
son
and
he
cursed
himself
that
ever
he
should
beget
a
son
that
should
eat
burnt
pig
whose
scent
was
wonderfully
sharpened
since
morning
soon
raked
out
another
pig

rending
it

trembled
every
joint
while
he
grasped
the
abominable
things
wavering
whether
he
should
not
put
his
son
to
death
for
an
unnatural
young
monster
when
the
crackling
scorching
his
fingers
as
it
had
done
his
son
and
applying
the
same
remedy
to
them
he
in
his
turn
tasted
some
of
its
flavour

make
what
sour
mouths
he
would

a
pretence
proved
not
altogether
displeasing
to
him
in
conclusion
for
the
manuscript
here
is
a
little
tedious
both
father
and
son
fairly
sat
down
to
the
mess
and
never
left
off
till
they
had
despatched
all
that
remained
of
the
litter
was
strictly
enjoined
not
to
let
the
secret
escape
for
the
neighbors
would
certainly
have
stoned
them
for
a
couple
of
abominable
wretches

could
think
of
improving
upon
the
good
meat
which
god
had
sent
them

strange
stories
got
about

was
observed
that
cottage
was
burnt
down
now
more
frequently
than
ever
nothing

fires
from
this
time
forward
some
would
break
out

the

was
the
more
remarkable

of
chastising
his
son
seemed
to
grow
more
indulgent
to
him

ever

terrible

produced
in

and
verdict
about
to
be
pronounced
when
the
foreman
of
the
jury
begged
that
some
of
the
burnt
pig
of
which
the
culprits
stood
accused
might
be
handed
into
the
box
he
handled
it

clearest
charge

had
ever
given
to
the
surprise
of
the
whole
court

and
all
present
without
leaving

they

not
guilty

was
a
shrewd
fellow
winked
at
the
manifest
iniquity
of
the
decision
and
when
the
court
was
dismissed
went
privily
and
bought
up
all
the
pigs
that
could
be
had
for
love
or
money
in
a
few
days
his
lordship
town
house
was
observed
to
be
on
fire
the
thing
took
wing
and
now
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
but
fires
in
every
direction

pigs
grew
enormously

it
was
feared
that
the
very
science
of
architecture
would
in
no
long
time
be
lost
to
the
world
thus
this
custom
of
firing
houses
continued
till
in
process
of
time
says
my
manuscript
a
sage
arose
like
our
locke
who
made
a
discovery
that
the
flesh
of
swine
or
indeed
of
any
other
animal
might
be
cooked
as
they
call
it
without
the
necessity
of
consuming
a
whole
house
to
dress
it

rude

of

the

mystery

solved

placing
too
implicit
faith
in
the
account
above
given
it
must
be
agreed
that
if
a
worthy
pretext
for
so
dangerous
an
experiment
as
setting
houses
on
fire
especially
in
these
days
could
be
assigned
in
favour
of
any
culinary
object
that
pretext
and
excuse
might
be
found
in
roast

all
the
delicacies

be

illustration
ye

i
remember
a
touch
of
conscience
in
this
kind
at
school
my
good
old
aunt
who
never
parted
from
me
at
the
end
of
a
holiday
without
stuffing
a
sweetmeat
or
some
nice
thing
into
my
pocket
had
dismissed
me
one
evening
with
a
smoking
fresh
from
the
oven
in
my
way
to
school
it
was
over
london
bridge
a
old
beggar
saluted
me
i
have
no
doubt
at
this
time
of
day
that
he
was
a
counterfeit
i
had
no
pence
to
console
him
with
and
in
the
vanity
of
and
the
very
coxcombry
of
charity
i
made
him
a
present
of
the
whole
cake
i
walked
on
a
little
buoyed
up
as
one
is
on
such
occasions
with
a
sweet
soothing
of
but
before
i
had
got
to
the
end
of
the
bridge
my
better
feelings
returned
and
i
burst
into
tears
thinking
how
ungrateful
i
had
been
to
my
good
aunt
to
go
and
give
her
good
gift
away
to
a
stranger
that
i
had
never
seen
before
and
who
might
be
a
bad
man
for
aught
i
knew
and
then
i
thought
of
the
pleasure
my
aunt
would
be
taking
in
thinking
that
i
i
myself
and
not
another
would
eat
her
nice
cake
and
what
should
i
say
to
her
the
next
time
i
saw
her
how
naughty
i
was
to
part
with
her
pretty
present
and
the
odour
of
that
spicy
cake
came
back
upon
my
recollection
and
the
pleasure
and
the
curiosity
i
had
taken
in
seeing
her
make
it
and
her
joy
when
she
sent
it
to
the
oven
and
how
disappointed
she
would
feel
that
i
had
never
had
a
bit
of
it
in
my
mouth
at
last
and
i
blamed
my
impertinent
spirit
of
almsgiving
and
hypocrisy
of
goodness
and
above
all
i
wished
never
to
see
the
face
again
of
that
insiduous
old
gray
impostor
our
ancestors
were
nice
in
their
method
of
sacrificing
these
tender
victims
we
read
of
pigs
whipt
to
death
with
something
of
a
shock
as
we
hear
of
any
other
obsolete
custom
the
age
of
discipline
is
gone
by
or
it
would
be
curious
to
inquire
in
a
philosophical
light
merely
what
effect
this
process
might
have
towards
intenerating
and
dulcifying
a
substance
naturally
so
mild
and
dulcet
as
the
flesh
of
young
pigs
it
looks
like
refining
a
violet
yet
we
should
be
cautious
while
we
condemn
the
inhumanity
how
we
censure
the
wisdom
of
the
practice
it
might
impart
a
gusto

pig
i
remember
an
hypothesis
argued
upon
by
the
young
students
when
i
was
at
omer
and
maintained
with
much
learning
and
pleasantry
on
both
sides
whether
supposing
that
the
flavor
of
a
pig
who
obtained
his
death
by
whipping
flagellationem
superadded
a
pleasure
upon
the
palate
of
a
man
more
intense
than
any
possible
suffering
we
can
conceive
in
the
animal
is
man
justified
in
using
that
method
of
putting
the
animal
to
death
i
forget
the
decision
his
sauce
should
be
considered
decidedly
a
few
bread
crumbs
done
up
with
his
liver
and
brains
and
a
dash
of
mild
sage
but
banish
dear
cook
i
beseech
you
the
whole
onion
tribe
barbecue
your
whole
hogs
to
your
palate
steep
them
in
shalots
stuff
them
out
with
plantations
of
the
rank
and
guilty
garlic
you
can
not
poison
them
or
make
them
stronger
than
they
are
but
consider
he
is
a
weakling
a
flower
