the
city
of
dreadful
night
by

per
me
si
va
nella
citta
dolente
dante
poi
di
tanto
adoprar
di
tanti
moti
celeste
ogni
terrena
cosa
girando
senza
posa
per
tornar
sempre
la
donde
son
mosse
uso
alcuno
alcun
frutto
indovinar
non
so
sola
nel
mondo
eterna
a
cui
si
volve
ogni
creata
cosa
in
te
morte
si
posa
nostra
ignuda
natura
lieta
no
ma
sicura
dell
antico
dolor
pero
ch
esser
beato
nega
ai
mortali
e
nega
a
morti
il
fato
leopardi
proem
lo
thus
as
prostrate
in
the
dust
i
write
my
heart
deep
languor
and
my
soul
sad
tears
yet
why
evoke
the
spectres
of
black
night
to
blot
the
sunshine
of
exultant
years
why
disinter
dead
faith
from
mouldering
hidden
why
break
the
seals
of
mute
despair
unbidden
and
wail
life
discords
into
careless
ears
because
a
cold
rage
seizes
one
at
whiles
to
show
the
bitter
old
and
wrinkled
truth
stripped
naked
of
all
vesture
that
beguiles
false
dreams
false
hopes
false
masks
and
modes
of
youth
because
it
gives
some
sense
of
power
and
passion
in
helpless
innocence
to
try
to
fashion
our
woe
in
living
words
uncouth
surely
i
write
not
for
the
hopeful
young
or
those
who
deem
their
happiness
of
worth
or
such
as
pasture
and
grow
fat
among
the
shows
of
life
and
feel
nor
doubt
nor
dearth
or
pious
spirits
with
a
god
above
them
to
sanctify
and
glorify
and
love
them
or
sages
who
foresee
a
heaven
on
earth
for
none
of
these
i
write
and
none
of
these
could
read
the
writing
if
they
deigned
to
try
so
may
they
flourish
in
their
due
degrees
on
our
sweet
earth
and
in
their
unplaced
sky
if
any
cares
for
the
weak
words
here
written
it
must
be
some
one
desolate
whose
faith
and
hopes
are
dead
and
who
would
die
yes
here
and
there
some
weary
wanderer
in
that
same
city
of
tremendous
night
will
understand
the
speech
and
feel
a
stir
of
fellowship
in
fight
i
suffer
mute
and
lonely
yet
another
uplifts
his
voice
to
let
me
know
a
brother
travels
the
same
wild
paths
though
out
of
sight
o
sad
fraternity
do
i
unfold
your
dolorous
mysteries
shrouded
from
of
yore
nay
be
assured
no
secret
can
be
told
to
any
who
divined
it
not
before
none
uninitiate
by
many
a
presage
will
comprehend
the
language
of
the
message
although
proclaimed
aloud
for
evermore
i
the
city
is
of
night
perchance
of
death
but
certainly
of
night
for
never
there
can
come
the
lucid
morning
fragrant
breath
after
the
dewy
dawning
cold
grey
air
the
moon
and
stars
may
shine
with
scorn
or
pity
the
sun
has
never
visited
that
city
for
it
dissolveth
in
the
daylight
fair
dissolveth
like
a
dream
of
night
away
though
present
in
distempered
gloom
of
thought
and
deadly
weariness
of
heart
all
day
but
when
a
dream
night
after
night
is
brought
throughout
a
week
and
such
weeks
few
or
many
recur
each
year
for
several
years
can
any
discern
that
dream
from
real
life
in
aught
for
life
is
but
a
dream
whose
shapes
return
some
frequently
some
seldom
some
by
night
and
some
by
day
some
night
and
day
we
learn
the
while
all
change
and
many
vanish
quite
in
their
recurrence
with
recurrent
changes
a
certain
seeming
order
where
this
ranges
we
count
things
real
such
is
memory
might
a
river
girds
the
city
west
and
south
the
main
north
channel
of
a
broad
lagoon
regurging
with
the
salt
tides
from
the
mouth
waste
marshes
shine
and
glister
to
the
moon
for
leagues
then
moorland
black
then
stony
ridges
great
piers
and
causeways
many
noble
bridges
connect
the
town
and
islet
suburbs
strewn
upon
an
easy
slope
it
lies
at
large
and
scarcely
overlaps
the
long
curved
crest
which
swells
out
two
leagues
from
the
river
marge
a
trackless
wilderness
rolls
north
and
west
savannahs
savage
woods
enormous
mountains
bleak
uplands
black
ravines
with
torrent
fountains
and
eastward
rolls
the
shipless
sea
unrest
the
city
is
not
ruinous
although
great
ruins
of
an
unremembered
past
with
others
of
a
few
short
years
ago
more
sad
are
found
within
its
precincts
vast
the
always
burn
but
scarce
a
casement
in
house
or
palace
front
from
roof
to
basement
doth
glow
or
gleam
athwart
the
mirk
air
cast
the
burn
amid
the
baleful
glooms
amidst
the
soundless
solitudes
immense
of
ranged
mansions
dark
and
still
as
tombs
the
silence
which
benumbs
or
strains
the
sense
fulfils
with
awe
the
soul
despair
unweeping
myriads
of
habitants
are
ever
sleeping
or
dead
or
fled
from
nameless
pestilence
yet
as
in
some
necropolis
you
find
perchance
one
mourner
to
a
thousand
dead
so
there
worn
faces
that
look
deaf
and
blind
like
tragic
masks
of
stone
with
weary
tread
each
wrapt
in
his
own
doom
they
wander
wander
or
sit
foredone
and
desolately
ponder
through
sleepless
hours
with
heavy
drooping
head
mature
men
chiefly
few
in
age
or
youth
a
woman
rarely
now
and
then
a
child
a
child
if
here
the
heart
turns
sick
with
ruth
to
see
a
little
one
from
birth
defiled
or
lame
or
blind
as
preordained
to
languish
through
youthless
life
think
how
it
bleeds
with
anguish
to
meet
one
erring
in
that
homeless
wild
they
often
murmur
to
themselves
they
speak
to
one
another
seldom
for
their
woe
broods
maddening
inwardly
and
scorns
to
wreak
itself
abroad
and
if
at
whiles
it
grow
to
frenzy
which
must
rave
none
heeds
the
clamour
unless
there
waits
some
victim
of
like
glamour
to
rave
in
turn
who
lends
attentive
show
the
city
is
of
night
but
not
of
sleep
there
sweet
sleep
is
not
for
the
weary
brain
the
pitiless
hours
like
years
and
ages
creep
a
night
seems
termless
hell
this
dreadful
strain
of
thought
and
consciousness
which
never
ceases
or
which
some
moments
stupor
but
increases
this
worse
than
woe
makes
wretches
there
insane
they
leave
all
hope
behind
who
enter
there
one
certitude
while
sane
they
can
not
leave
one
anodyne
for
torture
and
despair
the
certitude
of
death
which
no
reprieve
can
put
off
long
and
which
divinely
tender
but
waits
the
outstretched
hand
to
promptly
render
that
draught
whose
slumber
nothing
can
bereave
though
the
garden
of
thy
life
be
wholly
waste
the
sweet
flowers
withered
the
barren
over
its
wall
hang
ever
the
rich
dark
clusters
of
the
vine
of
death
within
easy
reach
of
thy
hand
which
may
pluck
of
them
when
it
will
ii
because
he
seemed
to
walk
with
an
intent
i
followed
him
who
shadowlike
and
frail
unswervingly
though
slowly
onward
went
regardless
wrapt
in
thought
as
in
a
veil
thus
step
for
step
with
lonely
sounding
feet
we
travelled
many
a
long
dim
silent
street
at
length
he
paused
a
black
mass
in
the
gloom
a
tower
that
merged
into
the
heavy
sky
around
the
huddled
stones
of
grave
and
tomb
some
old
now
corruption
sty
he
murmured
to
himself
with
dull
despair
here
faith
died
poisoned
by
this
charnel
air
then
turning
to
the
right
went
on
once
more
and
travelled
weary
roads
without
suspense
and
reached
at
last
a
low
wall
open
door
whose
villa
gleamed
beyond
the
foliage
dense
he
gazed
and
muttered
with
a
hard
despair
here
love
died
stabbed
by
its
own
worshipped
pair
then
turning
to
the
right
resumed
his
march
and
travelled
street
and
lanes
with
wondrous
strength
until
on
stooping
through
a
narrow
arch
we
stood
before
a
squalid
house
at
length
he
gazed
and
whispered
with
a
cold
despair
here
hope
died
starved
out
in
its
utmost
lair
when
he
had
spoken
thus
before
he
stirred
i
spoke
perplexed
by
something
in
the
signs
of
desolation
i
had
seen
and
heard
in
this
drear
pilgrimage
to
ruined
shrines
where
faith
and
love
and
hope
are
dead
indeed
can
life
still
live
by
what
doth
it
proceed
as
whom
his
one
intense
thought
overpowers
he
answered
coldly
take
a
watch
erase
the
signs
and
figures
of
the
circling
hours
detach
the
hands
remove
the
the
works
proceed
until
run
down
although
bereft
of
purpose
void
of
use
still
go
then
turning
to
the
right
paced
on
again
and
traversed
squares
and
travelled
streets
whose
glooms
seemed
more
and
more
familiar
to
my
ken
and
reached
that
sullen
temple
of
the
tombs
and
paused
to
murmur
with
the
old
despair
hear
faith
died
poisoned
by
this
charnel
air
i
ceased
to
follow
for
the
knot
of
doubt
was
severed
sharply
with
a
cruel
knife
he
circled
thus
forever
tracing
out
the
series
of
the
fraction
left
of
life
perpetual
recurrence
in
the
scope
of
but
three
terms
dead
faith
dead
love
dead
hope
lxx
life
divided
by
that
persistent
three
iii
although
lamps
burn
along
the
silent
streets
even
when
moonlight
silvers
empty
squares
the
dark
holds
countless
lanes
and
close
retreats
but
when
the
night
its
sphereless
mantle
wears
the
open
spaces
yawn
with
gloom
abysmal
the
sombre
mansions
loom
immense
and
dismal
the
lanes
are
black
as
subterranean
lairs
and
soon
the
eye
a
strange
new
vision
learns
the
night
remains
for
it
as
dark
and
dense
yet
clearly
in
this
darkness
it
discerns
as
in
the
daylight
with
its
natural
sense
perceives
a
shade
in
shadow
not
obscurely
pursues
a
stir
of
black
in
blackness
surely
sees
spectres
also
in
the
gloom
intense
the
ear
too
with
the
silence
vast
and
deep
becomes
familiar
though
unreconciled
hears
breathings
as
of
hidden
life
asleep
and
muffled
throbs
as
of
pent
passions
wild
far
murmurs
speech
of
pity
or
derision
but
all
more
dubious
than
the
things
of
vision
so
that
it
knows
not
when
it
is
beguiled
no
time
abates
the
first
despair
and
awe
but
wonder
ceases
soon
the
weirdest
thing
is
felt
least
strange
beneath
the
lawless
law
where
is
the
eternal
king
crushed
impotent
beneath
this
reign
of
terror
dazed
with
mysteries
of
woe
and
error
the
soul
is
too
outworn
for
wondering
iv
he
stood
alone
within
the
spacious
square
declaiming
from
the
central
grassy
mound
with
head
uncovered
and
with
streaming
hair
as
if
large
multitudes
were
gathered
round
a
stalwart
shape
the
gestures
full
of
might
the
glances
burning
with
unnatural
light
as
i
came
through
the
desert
thus
it
was
as
i
came
through
the
desert
all
was
black
in
heaven
no
single
star
on
earth
no
track
a
brooding
hush
without
a
stir
or
note
the
air
so
thick
it
clotted
in
my
throat
and
thus
for
hours
then
some
enormous
things
swooped
past
with
savage
cries
and
clanking
wings
but
i
strode
on
austere
no
hope
could
have
no
fear
as
i
came
through
the
desert
thus
it
was
as
i
came
through
the
desert
eyes
of
fire
glared
at
me
throbbing
with
a
starved
desire
the
hoarse
and
heavy
and
carnivorous
breath
was
hot
upon
me
from
deep
jaws
of
death
sharp
claws
swift
talons
fleshless
fingers
cold
plucked
at
me
from
the
bushes
tried
to
hold
but
i
strode
on
austere
no
hope
could
have
no
fear
as
i
came
through
the
desert
thus
it
was
as
i
came
through
the
desert
lo
you
there
that
hillock
burning
with
a
brazen
glare
those
myriad
dusky
flames
with
points
which
writhed
and
hissed
and
darted
to
and
fro
a
sabbath
of
the
serpents
heaped
for
devil
and
some
fete
of
hell
yet
i
strode
on
austere
no
hope
could
have
no
fear
as
i
came
through
the
desert
thus
it
was
as
i
came
through
the
desert
meteors
ran
and
crossed
their
javelins
on
the
black
the
zenith
opened
to
a
gulf
of
flame
the
dreadful
thunderbolts
jarred
earth
fixed
frame
the
ground
all
heaved
in
waves
of
fire
that
surged
and
weltered
round
me
sole
there
unsubmerged
yet
i
strode
on
austere
no
hope
could
have
no
fear
as
i
came
through
the
desert
thus
it
was
as
i
came
through
the
desert
air
once
more
and
i
was
close
upon
a
wild
enormous
cliffs
arose
on
either
hand
the
deep
tide
thundered
up
a
strand
white
foambelts
seethed
there
wan
spray
swept
and
flew
the
sky
broke
moon
and
stars
and
clouds
and
blue
yet
i
strode
on
austere
no
hope
could
have
no
fear
as
i
came
through
the
desert
thus
it
was
as
i
came
through
the
desert
on
the
left
the
sun
arose
and
crowned
a
broad
there
stopped
and
burned
out
black
except
a
rim
a
bleeding
eyeless
socket
red
and
dim
whereon
the
moon
fell
suddenly
and
stood
above
the
cliffs
at
rest
yet
i
strode
on
austere
no
hope
could
have
no
fear
as
i
came
through
the
desert
thus
it
was
as
i
came
through
the
desert
from
the
right
a
shape
came
slowly
with
a
ruddy
light
a
woman
with
a
red
lamp
in
her
hand
bareheaded
and
barefooted
on
that
strand
o
desolation
moving
with
such
grace
o
anguish
with
such
beauty
in
thy
face
i
fell
as
on
my
bier
hope
travailed
with
such
fear
as
i
came
through
the
desert
thus
it
was
as
i
came
through
the
desert
i
was
twain
two
selves
distinct
that
can
not
join
again
one
stood
apart
and
knew
but
could
not
stir
and
watched
the
other
stark
in
swoon
and
her
and
she
came
on
and
never
turned
aside
between
such
sun
and
moon
and
roaring
tide
and
as
she
came
more
near
my
soul
grew
mad
with
fear
as
i
came
through
the
desert
thus
it
was
as
i
came
through
the
desert
hell
is
mild
and
piteous
matched
with
that
accursed
wild
a
large
black
sign
was
on
her
breast
that
bowed
a
broad
black
band
ran
down
her
shroud
that
lamp
she
held
was
her
own
burning
heart
whose
trickled
step
by
step
apart
the
mystery
was
clear
mad
rage
had
swallowed
fear
as
i
came
through
the
desert
thus
it
was
as
i
came
through
the
desert
by
the
sea
she
knelt
and
bent
above
that
senseless
me
those
fell
upon
my
white
brow
there
she
tried
to
cleanse
them
with
her
tears
and
hair
she
murmured
words
of
pity
love
and
woe
shee
heeded
not
the
level
rushing
flow
and
mad
with
rage
and
fear
i
stood
stonebound
so
near
as
i
came
through
the
desert
thus
it
was
as
i
came
through
the
desert
when
the
tide
swept
up
to
her
there
kneeling
by
my
side
she
clasped
that
me
and
they
were
borne
away
and
this
vile
me
was
left
forlorn
i
know
the
whole
sea
can
not
quench
that
heart
or
cleanse
that
brow
or
wash
those
two
apart
they
love
their
doom
is
drear
yet
they
nor
hope
nor
fear
but
i
what
do
i
here
v
how
he
arrives
there
none
can
clearly
know
athwart
the
mountains
and
immense
wild
tracts
or
flung
a
waif
upon
that
vast
or
down
the
river
boiling
cataracts
to
reach
it
is
as
dying
to
leave
it
slow
faint
birth
intense
pangs
quicken
and
memory
swoons
in
both
the
tragic
acts
but
being
there
one
feels
a
citizen
escape
seems
hopeless
to
the
heart
forlorn
can
be
brought
to
life
again
and
yet
release
does
come
there
comes
a
morn
when
he
awakes
from
slumbering
so
sweetly
that
all
the
world
is
changed
for
him
completely
and
he
is
verily
as
if
he
scarcely
can
believe
the
blissful
change
he
weeps
perchance
who
wept
not
while
accurst
never
again
will
he
approach
the
range
infected
by
that
evil
spell
now
burst
poor
wretch
who
once
hath
paced
that
dolent
city
shall
pace
it
often
doomed
beyond
all
pity
with
horror
ever
deepening
from
the
first
though
he
possess
sweet
babes
and
loving
wife
a
home
of
peace
by
loyal
friendships
cheered
and
love
them
more
than
death
or
happy
life
they
shall
avail
not
he
must
dree
his
weird
renounce
all
blessings
for
that
imprecation
steal
forth
and
haunt
that
builded
desolation
of
woe
and
terrors
and
thick
darkness
reared
vi
i
sat
forlornly
by
the
and
watched
the
glow
like
golden
stars
above
the
blackness
of
the
swelling
tide
down
which
they
struck
rough
gold
in
ruddier
bars
and
heard
the
heave
and
plashing
of
the
flow
against
the
wall
a
dozen
feet
below
large
stood
along
that
and
under
one
a
few
steps
from
my
seat
i
heard
strange
voices
join
in
stranger
talk
although
i
had
not
heard
approaching
feet
these
bodiless
voices
in
my
waking
dream
flowed
dark
words
blending
with
sombre
stream
and
you
have
after
all
come
back
come
back
i
was
about
to
follow
on
your
track
and
you
have
failed
our
spark
of
hope
is
black
that
i
have
failed
is
proved
by
my
return
the
spark
is
quenched
nor
ever
more
will
burn
but
listen
and
the
story
you
shall
learn
i
reached
the
portal
common
spirits
fear
and
read
the
words
above
it
dark
yet
clear
leave
hope
behind
all
ye
who
enter
here
and
would
have
passed
in
gratified
to
gain
that
positive
eternity
of
pain
instead
of
this
insufferable
inane
a
demon
warder
clutched
me
not
so
fast
first
leave
your
hopes
behind
but
years
have
passed
since
i
left
all
behind
me
to
the
last
you
can
not
count
for
hope
with
all
your
wit
this
bleak
despair
that
drives
me
to
the
pit
how
could
i
seek
to
enter
void
of
it
he
snarled
what
thing
is
this
which
apes
a
soul
and
would
find
entrance
to
our
gulf
of
dole
without
the
payment
of
the
settled
toll
outside
the
gate
he
showed
an
open
chest
here
pay
their
entrance
fees
the
souls
unblest
cast
in
some
hope
you
enter
with
the
rest
this
is
pandora
box
whose
lid
shall
shut
and
too
when
hopes
have
filled
it
but
they
are
so
thin
that
it
will
never
glut
i
stood
a
few
steps
backwards
desolate
and
watched
the
spirits
pass
me
to
their
fate
and
fling
off
hope
and
enter
at
the
gate
when
one
casts
off
a
load
he
springs
upright
squares
back
his
shoulders
breathes
will
all
his
might
and
briskly
paces
forward
strong
and
light
but
these
as
if
they
took
some
burden
bowed
the
whole
frame
sank
however
strong
and
proud
before
they
crept
in
quite
infirm
and
cowed
and
as
they
passed
me
earnestly
from
each
a
morsel
of
his
hope
i
did
beseech
to
pay
my
entrance
but
all
mocked
my
speech
no
one
would
cede
a
little
of
his
store
though
knowing
that
in
instants
three
or
four
he
must
resign
the
whole
for
evermore
so
i
returned
our
destiny
is
fell
for
in
this
limbo
we
must
ever
dwell
shut
out
alike
from
heaven
and
earth
and
hell
the
other
sighed
back
yea
but
if
we
grope
with
care
through
all
this
limbo
dreary
scope
we
yet
may
pick
up
some
minute
lost
hope
and
sharing
it
between
us
entrance
win
in
spite
of
fiends
so
jealous
for
gross
sin
let
us
without
delay
our
search
begin
vii
some
say
that
phantoms
haunt
those
shadowy
streets
and
mingle
freely
there
with
sparse
mankind
and
tell
of
ancient
woes
and
black
defeats
and
murmur
mysteries
in
the
grave
enshrined
but
others
think
them
visions
of
illusion
or
even
men
gone
far
in
no
man
there
being
wholly
sane
in
mind
and
yet
a
man
who
raves
however
mad
who
bares
his
heart
and
tells
of
his
own
fall
reserves
some
inmost
secret
good
or
bad
the
phantoms
have
no
reticence
at
all
the
nudity
of
flesh
will
blush
though
tameless
the
extreme
nudity
of
bone
grins
shameless
the
unsexed
skeleton
mocks
shroud
and
pall
i
have
seen
phantoms
there
that
were
as
men
and
men
that
were
as
phantoms
flit
and
roam
marked
shapes
that
were
not
living
to
my
ken
caught
breathings
acrid
as
with
dead
sea
foam
the
city
rests
for
man
so
weird
and
awful
that
his
intrusion
there
might
seem
unlawful
and
phantoms
there
may
have
their
proper
home
viii
while
i
still
lingered
on
that
and
watched
the
tide
as
black
as
our
black
doom
i
heard
another
couple
join
in
talk
and
saw
them
to
the
left
hand
in
the
gloom
seated
against
an
elm
bole
on
the
ground
their
eyes
intent
upon
the
stream
profound
i
never
knew
another
man
on
earth
but
had
some
joy
and
solace
in
his
life
some
chance
of
triumph
in
the
dreadful
strife
my
doom
has
been
unmitigated
dearth
we
gaze
upon
the
river
and
we
note
the
various
vessels
large
and
small
that
float
ignoring
every
wrecked
and
sunken
boat
and
yet
i
asked
no
splendid
dower
no
spoil
of
sway
or
fame
or
rank
or
even
wealth
but
homely
love
with
common
food
and
health
and
nightly
sleep
to
balance
daily
toil
this
soul
would
arrogate
unto
itself
some
signalising
hate
from
the
supreme
indifference
of
fate
who
is
most
wretched
in
this
dolorous
place
i
think
myself
yet
i
would
rather
be
my
miserable
self
than
he
than
he
who
formed
such
creatures
to
his
own
disgrace
the
vilest
thing
must
be
less
vile
than
thou
from
whom
it
had
its
being
god
and
lord
creator
of
all
woe
and
sin
abhorred
malignant
and
implacable
i
vow
that
not
for
all
thy
power
furled
and
unfurled
for
all
the
temples
to
thy
glory
built
would
i
assume
the
ignominious
guilt
of
having
made
such
men
in
such
a
world
as
if
a
being
god
or
fiend
could
reign
at
once
so
wicked
foolish
and
insane
as
to
produce
men
when
he
might
refrain
the
world
rolls
round
for
ever
like
a
mill
it
grinds
out
death
and
life
and
good
and
ill
it
has
no
purpose
heart
or
mind
or
will
while
air
of
space
and
time
full
river
flow
the
mill
must
blindly
whirl
unresting
so
it
may
be
wearing
out
but
who
can
know
man
might
know
one
thing
were
his
sight
less
dim
that
it
whirls
not
to
suit
his
petty
whim
that
it
is
quite
indifferent
to
him
nay
does
it
treat
him
harshly
as
he
saith
it
grinds
him
some
slow
years
of
bitter
breath
then
grinds
him
back
into
eternal
death
ix
it
is
full
strange
to
him
who
hears
and
feels
when
wandering
there
in
some
deserted
street
the
booming
and
the
jar
of
ponderous
wheels
the
trampling
clash
of
heavy
ironshod
feet
who
in
this
venice
of
the
black
sea
rideth
who
in
this
city
of
the
stars
abideth
to
buy
or
sell
as
those
in
daylight
sweet
the
rolling
thunder
seems
to
fill
the
sky
as
it
comes
on
the
horses
snort
and
strain
the
harness
jingles
as
it
passes
by
the
hugeness
of
an
overburthened
wain
a
man
sits
nodding
on
the
shaft
or
trudges
three
parts
asleep
beside
his
and
so
it
rolls
into
the
night
again
what
merchandise
whence
whither
and
for
whom
perchance
it
is
a
hearse
bearing
away
to
some
mysterious
tomb
or
limbo
of
the
scornful
universe
the
joy
the
peace
the
the
abortions
of
all
things
good
which
should
have
been
our
portions
but
have
been
strangled
by
that
city
curse
x
the
mansion

apart
in
its
own
ground
in
front
thereof
a
fragrant
high

about
it
and
the
whole
walled
round
the
massy
iron
gates
were
both
withdrawn
and
every
window
of
its
front
shed
light
portentous
in
that
city
of
the
night
but
though
thus
lighted
it
was
deadly
still
as
all
the
countless
bulks
of
solid
gloom
perchance
a
congregation
to
fulfil
solemnities
of
silence
in
this
doom
mysterious
rites
of
dolour

despair

steps

to
a
terrace
broad
whereon
lay
still
light
from
the
open
door
the
hall
was
noble
and
its
aspect
awed
hung
round
with
heavy
black
from
dome
to
floor
and
ample
stairways
rose
to
left
and
right
whose
balustrades
were
also
draped
with
night
i
paced
from
room
to
room
from
hall
to
hall
nor
any
life
throughout
the
maze
discerned
but
each
was
hung
with
its
funereal
pall
and
held
a
shrine
around
which
tapers
burned
with
picture
or
with
statue
or
with
bust
all
copied
from
the
same
fair
form
of
dust
a
woman
very
young
and
very
fair
beloved
by
bounteous
life
and
joy
and
youth
and
loving
these
sweet
lovers
so
that
care
and
age
and
death
seemed
not
for
her
in
sooth
alike
as
stars
all
beautiful
and
bright
these
shapes
lit
up
that
mausolean
night
at
length
i
heard
a
murmur
as
of
lips
and
reached
an
open
oratory
hung
with
heaviest
blackness
of
the
whole
eclipse
beneath
the
dome
a
fuming
censer
swung
and
one
lay
there
upon
a
low
white
bed
with
tapers
burning
at
the
foot
and
head
the
lady
of
the
images
supine
deathstill
lifesweet
with
folded
palms
she
lay
and
kneeling
there
as
at
a
sacred
shrine
a
young
man
wan
and
worn
who
seemed
to
pray
a
crucifix
of
dim
and
ghostly
white
surmounted

large
altar
left
in
night
the
chambers
of
the
mansion
of
my
heart
in
every
one
whereof
thine
image
dwells
are
black
with
grief
eternal
for
thy
sake
the
inmost
oratory
of
my
soul
wherein
thou
ever
dwellest
quick
or
dead
is
black
with
grief
eternal
for
thy
sake
i
kneel
beside
thee
and
i
clasp
the
cross
with
eyes
forever
fixed
upon
that
face
so
beautiful
and
dreadful
in
its
calm
i
kneel
here
patient
as
thou
liest
there
as
patient
as
a
statue
carved
in
stone
of
adoration
and
eternal
grief
while
thou
dost
not
awake
i
can
not
move
and
something
tells
me
thou
wilt
never
wake
and
i
alive
feel
turning
into
stone
most
beautiful
were
death
to
end
my
grief
most
hateful
to
destroy
the
sight
of
thee
dear
vision
better
than
all
death
or
life
but
i
renounce
all
choice
of
life
or
death
for
either
shall
be
ever
at
thy
side
and
thus
in
bliss
or
woe
be
ever
he
murmured
thus
and
thus
in
monotone
intent
upon
that
uncorrupted
face
entranced
except
his
moving
lips
alone
i
glided
with
hushed
footsteps
from
the
place
this
was
the
festival
that
filled
with
light
that
palace
in
the
city

the
night
xi
what
men
are
they
who
haunt
these
fatal
glooms
and
fill
their
living
mouths
with
dust
of
death
and
make
their
habitations
in
the
tombs
and
breathe
eternal
sighs
with
mortal
breath
and
pierce
life
pleasant
veil
of
various
error
to
reach
that
void
of
darkness
and
old
terror
wherein
expire
the
lamps

hope
and
faith

have
much
wisdom

they
are
not
wise
they
have

goodness
yet
they
do
not
well
the
fools

know
have
their
own
paradise
the
wicked
also
have
their
proper
hell
they
have
much
strength
but
still
their
doom
is
stronger
much
patience
but
their
time
endureth
longer
much
valour
but
life
mocks
it
with
some
spell
they
are
most
rational
and
yet
insane
and
outward
madness
not
to
be
controlled
a
perfect
reason
in
the
central
brain
which
has
no
power
but
sitteth
wan
and
cold
and
sees
the
madness
and
foresees
as
plainly
the
ruin
in
its
path
and
trieth
vainly
to
cheat
itself
refusing
to
behold
and
some
are
great
in
rank
and
wealth
and
power
and
some
renowned
for
genius

for
worth

some
are
poor

brood
and
cower

shrink
from
notice

accept
all
dearth

body
heart

soul

challenged
by

sad

responded
with

entered
the

in

i

of

the
wildest

strange

showeth
man
most
utterly
beguiled
to
those
who
haunt
that
sunless
city

he
bemoans
himself

is
deadly
swift
how
life
is
fleeting
how
naught
is
constant
on
the
earth
but
change
the
hours
are
heavy
on
him
and
the
days
the
burden
of
the
months
he
scarce
can
bear
and
often
in
his
secret
soul
he
prays
to
sleep
through
barren
periods
unaware
arousing
at
some
date
of
pleasure
which
having
passed
and
yielded
him
small
treasure
he
would
outsleep
another
term
of
care
yet
in
his
marvellous
fancy
he
must
make
quick
wings
for
time
and
see
it
fly
from
us
this
time
which
crawleth
like
a
monstrous
snake
wounded
and
slow
and
very
venomous
which
creeps
blindwormlike
round
the
earth
and
ocean
distilling
poison
at
each
painful
motion
and
seems
condemned
to
circle
ever
thus
and
since
he
can
not
spend
and
use
aright
the
little
time
here
given
him
in
trust

wasteth
it
in
weary
undelight
of
foolish
toil

trouble
strife

lust

naturally
claimeth

inherit
the

hours

too
ample

large
glooms
were
gathered
in
the
mighty
fane
with
tinted
moongleams
slanting
here
and
there
and
all
was
hush
no
swelling
no
chant
no
voice
or
murmuring
of
prayer
no
priests
came
forth
no
tinkling
censers
fumed
and
the
high
altar
space
was
unillumed
around
the
pillars
and
against
the
walls
leaned
men
and
shadows
others
seemed
to
brood
bent
or
recumbent
in
secluded
stalls
perchance
they
were
not
a
great
multitude
save
in
that
city
of
so
lonely
streets
where
one
may
count
up
every
face
he
meets
all
patiently
awaited
the
event
without
a
stir
or
sound
as
if
no
less
doomstricken
while
attent
and
then
we
heard
a
voice
of
solemn
stress
from
the
dark
pulpit
and
our
gaze
there
met
two
eyes
which
burned
as
never
eyes
burned
yet
two
steadfast
and
intolerable
eyes
burning
beneath
a
broad
and
rugged
brow
the
head
behind
it
of
enormous
size
and
as
black
in
a
large
wind
bow
our
rooted
congregation
by
that
great
sad
voice
deep
and
full
were
swayed
o
melancholy
brothers
dark
dark
dark
o
battling
in
black
floods
without
an
ark
o
spectral
wanderers
of
unholy
night
my
soul
hath
bled
for
you
these
sunless
years
with
bitter
running
down
like
tears
oh
dark
dark
dark
withdrawn
from
joy
and
light
my
heart
is
sick
with
anguish
for
your
bale
your
woe
hath
been
my
anguish
yea
i
quail
and
perish
in
your
perishing
unblest
and
i
have
searched
the
highths
and
depths
the
scope
of
all
our
universe
with
desperate
hope
to
find
some
solace
for
your
wild
unrest

i
bring
witnessed
by
every

you

there

no

made
us
and
tortures
us
if
we
must
pine
it
is
to
satiate
no
being

it
was
the
dark
delusion
of
a
dream
that
living
person
conscious
and
supreme
whom
we
must
curse
for
cursing
us
with
life
whom
we
must
curse
because
the
life
he
gave
could
not
be
buried
in
the
quiet
grave
could
not
be
killed
by
poison
or
the
knife
this
little
life
is
all
we
must
endure
the
grave
most
holy
peace
is
ever
sure
we
fall
asleep

never
wake

the

dissolve

afresh
in
earth

finish
thus

finish

it

thus
this

nothing

their

around
the

obdurate
as

regard
with

tremulous

xviii
i
wandered
in
a
suburb
of
the
north
and
reached
a
spot
whence
three
close
lanes
led
down
beneath
thick
trees
and
hedgerows
winding
forth
like
deep
brook
channels
deep
and
dark
and
lown
the
air
above
was
wan
with
misty
light
the
dull
grey
south
showed
one
vague
blur
of
white
i
took
the
path
and
slowly
trod
its
earthen
footpath
brushing
as
i
went
the
humid
leafage
and
my
feet
were
shod
with
heavy
languor
and
my
frame
downbent
with
infinite
sleepless
weariness
outworn
so
many
nights
i
thus
had
paced
forlorn
after
a
hundred
steps
i
grew
aware
of
something
crawling
in
the
lane
below
it
seemed
a
wounded
creature
prostrate
there
that
sobbed
with
pangs
in
making
progress
slow
the
hind
limbs
stretched
to
push
the
fore
limbs
then
to
drag
for
it
would
die
in
its
own
den
but
coming
level
with
it
i
discerned
that
it
had
been
a
man
for
at
my
tread
it
stopped
in
its
sore
travail
and
leaning
upon
its
right
and
raised
its
head
and
with
the
left
hand
twitched
back
as
in
ire
long
grey
unreverend
locks
befouled
with
mire
a
haggard
filthy
face
with
bloodshot
eyes
an
infamy
for
manhood
to
behold
he
gasped
all
trembling
what
you
want
my
prize
you
leave
to
rob
me
wine
and
lust
and
gold
and
all
that
men
go
mad
upon
since
you
have
traced
my
sacred
secret
of
the
clue
you
think
that
i
am
weak
and
must
submit
yet
i
but
scratch
you
with
this
poisoned
blade
and
you
are
dead
as
if
i
clove
with
it
that
false
fierce
greedy
heart
betrayed
betrayed
i
fling
this
phial
if
you
seek
to
pass
and
you
are
forthwith
shrivelled
up
like
grass
and
then
with
sudden
change
take
thought
take
thought
have
pity
on
me
it
is
mine
alone
if
you
could
find
it
would
avail
you
naught
seek
elsewhere
on
the
pathway
of
your
own
for
who
of
mortal
or
immortal
race
the
lifetrack
of
another
can
retrace
did
you
but
know
my
agony
and
toil
two
lanes
diverge
up
yonder
from
this
lane
my
thin
blood
marks
the
long
length
of
their
soil
such
clue
i
left
who
sought
my
clue
in
vain
my
hands
and
knees
are
worn
both
flesh
and
bone
i
can
not
move
but
with
continual
moan
but
i
am
in
the
very
way
at
last
to
find
the
broken
golden
thread
which
unites
my
present
with
my
past
if
you
but
go
your
own
way
and
i
said
i
will
retire
as
soon
as
you
have
told
whereunto
leadeth
this
lost
thread
of
gold
and
so
you
know
it
not
he
hissed
with
scorn
i
feared
you
imbecile
it
leads
me
back
from
this
accursed
night
without
a
morn
and
through
the
deserts
which
have
else
no
track
and
through
vast
wastes
of
time
to
eden
innocence
in
eden
clime
and
i
become
a
nursling
soft
and
pure
an
infant
cradled
on
its
mother
knee
without
a
past
and
secure
which
if
it
saw
this
loathsome
present
me
would
plunge
its
face
into
the
pillowing
breast
and
scream
abhorrence
hard
to
lull
to
rest
he
turned
to
grope
and
i
retiring
brushed
thin
shreds
of
gossamer
from
off
my
face
and
mused
his
life
would
grow
the
germ
uncrushed
he
should
to
antenatal
night
retrace
and
hide
his
elements
in
that
large
womb
beyond
the
reach
of
doom
and
even
thus
what
weary
way
were
planned
to
seek
oblivion
through
the
gate
of
birth
when
that
of
death
is
close
at
hand
for
this
is
law
if
law
there
be
in
fate
what
never
has
been
yet
may
have
its
when
the
thing
which
has
been
never
is
again

with

how
blest

matters
one
brief
night

the

fall
upon

wasted

all
sad

ever
banish

one

sleep

xx
i
sat
me
weary
on
a
pillar
base
and
leaned
against
the
shaft
for
broad
moonlight
the
peacefulness
of
cloistered
space
a
shore
of
shadow
slanting
from
the
right
the
great
cathedral
western
front
stood
there
a
rock
in
that
calm
sea
of
air
before
it
opposite
my
place
of
rest
two
figures
faced
each
other
large
austere
a
couchant
sphinx
in
shadow
to
the
breast
an
angel
standing
in
the
moonlight
clear
so
mighty
by
magnificence
of
form
they
were
not
dwarfed
beneath
that
mass
enorm
upon
the
of
the
naked
sword
the
angel
hands
as
prompt
to
smite
were
held
his
vigilant
intense
regard
was
poured
upon
the
creature
placidly
unquelled
whose
front
was
set
at
level
gaze
which
took
no
heed
of
aught
a
solemn
look
and
as
i
pondered
these
opposed
shapes
my
eyelids
sank
in
stupor
that
dull
swoon
which
drugs
and
with
a
leaden
mantle
drapes
the
outworn
to
worse
weariness
but
soon
a
sharp
and
clashing
noise
the
stillness
broke
and
from
the
evil
lethargy
i
woke
the
angel
wings
had
fallen
stone
on
stone
and
lay
there
shattered
hence
the
sudden
sound
a
warrior
leaning
on
his
sword
alone
now
watched
the
sphinx
with
that
regard
profound
the
sphinx
unchanged
looked
forthright
as
aware
of
nothing
in
the
vast
abyss
of
air
again
i
sank
in
that
repose
unsweet
again
a
clashing
noise
my
slumber
rent
the
warrior
sword
lay
broken
at
his
feet
an
unarmed
man
with
raised
hands
impotent
now
stood
before
the
sphinx
which
ever
kept
such
mien
as
if
open
eyes
it
slept
my
eyelids
sank
in
spite
of
wonder
grown
a
louder
crash
upstartled
me
in
dread
the
man
had
fallen
forward
stone
on
stone
and
lay
there
shattered
with
his
trunkless
head
between
the
monster
large
quiescent
paws
beneath
its
grand
front
changeless
as
life
laws
the
moon
had
circled
westward
full
and
bright
and
made
the
a
mystic
dream
and
bathed
the
whole
enclosure
with
its
light
the
sworded
angel
wrecks
the
sphinx
supreme
i
pondered
long
that
cold
majestic
face
whose
vision
seemed
of
infinite
void
space
xxi
anear
the
centre
of
that
northern
crest
stands
out
a
level
upland
bleak
and
bare
from
which
the
city
east
and
south
and
west
sinks
gently
in
long
waves
and
throned
there
an
image
sits
stupendous
superhuman
the
bronze
colossus
of
a
winged
woman
upon
a
graded
granite
base
foursquare
she
leans
forward
massively
with
cheek
on
clenched
left
hand
the
forearm
might
erect
its
elbow
on
her
rounded
knee
across
a
clasped
book
in
her
lap
the
right
upholds
a
pair
of
compasses
she
gazes
with
full
set
eyes
but
wandering
in
thick
mazes
of
sombre
thought
beholds
no
outward
sight
words
can
not
picture
her
but
all
men
know
that
solemn
sketch
the
pure
sad
artist
wrought
three
centuries
and
threescore
years
ago
with
phantasies
of
his
peculiar
thought
the
instruments
of
carpentry
and
science
scattered
about
her
feet
in
strange
alliance
with
the
keen
sleeping
undistraught
scales
bell
and
above
the
grave
and
solid
infant
perched
beside
with
open
winglets
that
might
bear
a
dove
intent
upon
its
tablets
her
folded
wings
as
of
a
mighty
eagle
but
all
too
impotent
to
lift
the
regal
robustness
of
her
strength
and
pride
and
with
those
wings
and
that
light
wreath
which
seems
to
mock
her
grand
head
and
the
knotted
frown
of
forehead
charged
with
baleful
thoughts
and
dreams
the
household
bunch
of
keys
the
housewife
gown
voluminous
indented
and
yet
rigid
as
if
a
shell
of
burnished
metal
frigid
the
feet
to
tread
all
weakness
down
the
comet
hanging
the
waste
dark
seas
the
massy
rainbow
curved
in
front
of
it
beyond
the
village
with
the
masts
and
trees
the
snaky
imp
from
the
pit
bearing
upon
its
batlike
leathern
pinions
her
name
unfolded
in
the
sun
dominions
the
melencolia
that
transcends
all
wit
thus
has
the
artist
copied
her
and
thus
surrounded
to
expound
her
form
sublime
her
fate
heroic
and
calamitous
fronting
the
dreadful
mysteries
of
time
unvanquished
in
defeat
and
desolation
undaunted
in
the
hopeless
conflagration
of
the
day
setting
on
her
baffled
prime
baffled
and
beaten
back
she
works
on
still
weary
and
sick
of
soul
she
works
the
more
sustained
by
her
indomitable
will
the
hands
shall
fashion
and
the
brain
shall
pore
and
all
her
sorrow
shall
be
turned
to
labour
till
death
the
piercing
with
his
sabre
that
mighty
heart
of
hearts
ends
bitter
war
but
as
if
blacker
night
could
dawn
on
night
with
tenfold
gloom
on
moonless
night
unstarred
a
sense
more
tragic
than
defeat
and
blight
more
desperate
than
strife
with
hope
debarred
more
fatal
than
the
adamantine
never
encompassing
her
passionate
endeavour
dawns
glooming
in
her
tenebrous
regard
to
sense
that
every
struggle
brings
defeat
because
fate
holds
no
prize
to
crown
success
that
all
the
oracles
are
dumb
or
cheat
because
they
have
no
secret
to
express
that
none
can
pierce
the
vast
black
veil
uncertain
because
there
is
no
light
beyond
the
curtain
that
all
is
vanity
and
nothingness
titanic
from
her
high
throne
in
the
north
that
city
sombre
patroness
and
queen
in
bronze
sublimity
she
gazes
forth
over
her
capital
of
teen
and
threne
over
the
river
with
its
isles
and
bridges
the
marsh
and
moorland
to
the
stern
confronting
them
with
a
coeval
mien
the
moving
moon
and
stars
from
east
to
west
circle
before
her
in
the
sea
of
air
shadows
and
gleams
glide
round
her
solemn
rest
her
subjects
often
gaze
up
to
her
there
the
strong
to
drink
new
strength
of
iron
endurance
the
weak
new
terrors
all
renewed
assurance
and
confirmation
of
the
old
despair
