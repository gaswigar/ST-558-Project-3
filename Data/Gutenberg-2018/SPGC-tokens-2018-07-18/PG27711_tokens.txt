preface
to
first
edition
we
must
ask
pardon
of
the
public
for
offering
it
this
book
and
give
it
due
warning
of
what
it
will
find
therein
the
public
loves
fictitious
novels
this
is
a
true
novel
it
loves
books
which
make
a
pretence
of
introducing
their
readers
to
fashionable
society
this
book
deals
with
the
life
of
the
street
it
loves
little
indecent
books
memoirs
of
courtesans
alcove
confessions
erotic
obscenity
the
scandal
tucked
away
in
pictures
in
a
bookseller
shop
window
that
which
is
contained
in
the
following
pages
is
rigidly
clean
and
pure
do
not
expect
the
photograph
of
pleasure
the
following
study
is
the
clinic
of
love
again
the
public
loves
to
read
pleasant
soothing
stories
adventures
that
end
happily
imaginative
works
that
disturb
neither
its
digestion
nor
its
peace
of
mind
this
book
furnishes
entertainment
of
a
melancholy
violent
sort
calculated
to
disarrange
the
habits
and
injure
the
health
of
the
public
why
then
have
we
written
it
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
annoy
the
public
and
offend
its
tastes
by
no
means
living
as
we
do
in
the
nineteenth
century
in
an
age
of
universal
suffrage
of
democracy
of
liberalism
we
asked
ourselves
the
question
whether
what
are
called
the
lower
classes
had
no
rights
in
the
novel
if
that
world
beneath
a
world
the
common
people
must
needs
remain
subject
to
the
literary
interdict
and
helpless
against
the
contempt
of
authors
who
have
hitherto
said
no
word
to
imply
that
the
common
people
possess
a
heart
and
soul
we
asked
ourselves
whether
in
these
days
of
equality
in
which
we
live
there
are
classes
unworthy
the
notice
of
the
author
and
the
reader
misfortunes
too
lowly
dramas
too
catastrophes
too
commonplace
in
the
terror
they
inspire
we
were
curious
to
know
if
that
conventional
symbol
of
a
forgotten
literature
of
a
vanished
society
tragedy
is
definitely
dead
if
in
a
country
where
castes
no
longer
exist
and
aristocracy
has
no
legal
status
the
miseries
of
the
lowly
and
the
poor
would
appeal
to
public
interest
emotion
compassion
as
forcibly
as
the
miseries
of
the
great
and
the
rich
if
in
a
word
the
tears
that
are
shed
in
low
life
have
the
same
power
to
cause
tears
to
flow
as
the
tears
shed
in
high
life
these
thoughts
led
us
to
venture
upon
the
humble
tale
in
they
lead
us
to
put
forth
now
let
the
book
be
spoken
slightingly
of
it
matters
little
at
this
day
when
the
sphere
of
the
novel
is
broadening
and
expanding
when
it
is
beginning
to
be
the
serious
impassioned
living
form
of
literary
study
and
social
investigation
when
it
is
becoming
by
virtue
of
analysis
and
psychological
research
the
true
history
of
contemporary
morals
when
the
novel
has
taken
its
place
among
the
necessary
elements
of
knowledge
it
may
properly
demand
its
liberty
and
freedom
of
speech
and
to
encourage
it
in
the
search
for
art
and
truth
to
authorize
it
to
disclose
misery
and
suffering
which
it
is
not
well
for
the
fortunate
people
of
paris
to
forget
and
to
show
to
people
of
fashion
what
the
sisters
of
charity
have
the
courage
to
see
for
themselves
what
the
queens
of
old
compelled
their
children
to
touch
with
their
eyes
in
the
hospitals
the
visible
palpitating
human
suffering
that
teaches
charity
to
confirm
the
novel
in
the
practice
of
that
religion
which
the
last
century
called
by
the
vast
and
name
it
needs
no
other
warrant
than
the
consciousness
that
that
is
its
right
october
second
preface
prepared
for
a
posthumous
edition
of
germinie
lacerteux
the
disease
is
gradually
doing
its
work
of
destruction
in
our
poor
rose
it
is
as
if
the
immaterial
manifestations
of
life
that
formerly
emanated
from
her
body
were
dying
one
by
one
her
face
is
entirely
changed
her
expression
is
not
the
same
her
gestures
are
not
the
same
and
she
seems
to
me
as
if
she
were
putting
off
every
day
more
and
more
of
that
something
humanly
speaking
indefinable
which
makes
the
personality
of
a
living
being
disease
before
making
an
end
of
its
victim
introduces
into
his
body
something
strange
unfamiliar
something
that
is
makes
of
him
a
new
being
so
to
speak
in
whom
we
must
seek
to
find
the
former
being
he
whose
joyous
affectionate
features
have
already
ceased
to
exist
doctor
simon
is
to
tell
me
very
soon
whether
our
dear
old
rose
will
live
or
die
i
am
waiting
to
hear
his
ring
which
to
me
is
equivalent
to
that
of
a
jury
at
the
assizes
announcing
their
return
to
the
court
room
with
their
verdict
it
is
all
over
there
is
no
hope
it
is
simply
a
question
of
time
the
disease
has
progressed
very
rapidly
one
lung
is
entirely
gone
and
the
other
substantially
and
we
must
return
to
the
invalid
restore
her
serenity
with
a
smile
give
her
reason
to
hope
for
convalescence
in
every
line
of
our
faces
then
we
feel
an
unconquerable
longing
to
rush
from
the
room
and
from
the
poor
creature
we
leave
the
house
we
wander
at
random
through
the
streets
at
last
overdone
with
fatigue
we
sit
down
at
a
table
in
a
café
we
mechanically
take
up
a
copy
of
and
our
eyes
fall
at
once
upon
the
solution
of
its
last
riddle
death
there
is
no
appeal
august
the
disease
of
the
lungs
is
complicated
with
peritonitis
she
has
terrible
pains
in
the
bowels
she
can
not
move
without
assistance
she
can
not
lie
on
her
back
or
her
left
side
in
god
name
is
not
death
enough
must
she
also
endure
suffering
aye
torture
as
the
final
implacable
of
the
human
organism
and
she
suffers
thus
poor
wretch
in
one
of
the
servant
rooms
where
the
sun
shining
in
through
a
window
in
the
sloping
roof
makes
the
air
as
stifling
as
in
a
hothouse
and
where
there
is
so
little
room
that
the
doctor
has
to
put
his
hat
on
the
bed
we
struggled
to
the
last
to
keep
her
but
finally
we
had
to
make
up
our
minds
to
let
her
go
away
she
was
unwilling
to
go
to
maison
dubois
where
we
proposed
to
take
her
it
seems
that
years
ago
when
she
first
came
to
us
she
went
there
to
see
the
nurse
in
charge
of
edmond
who
died
there
and
so
that
particular
hospital
represents
to
her
the
place
where
people
die
i
am
waiting
for
simon
who
is
to
bring
her
a
permit
to
go
to
lariboisière
she
passed
almost
a
good
night
she
is
all
ready
in
high
spirits
in
fact
we
have
covered
everything
up
from
her
as
well
as
we
could
she
longs
to
be
gone
she
is
in
a
great
hurry
she
feels
that
she
is
going
to
get
well
there
at
two
simon
arrives
here
it
is
all
right
she
refuses
to
have
a
litter
i
should
think
i
was
dead
she
says
she
is
dressed
as
soon
as
she
leaves
her
bed
all
the
signs
of
life
to
be
seen
upon
her
face
disappear
it
is
as
if
the
earth
had
risen
under
her
skin
she
comes
down
into
our
apartments
sitting
in
the
with
a
trembling
hand
the
knuckles
of
which
knock
against
one
another
she
draws
her
stockings
on
over
a
pair
of
legs
like
broomsticks
consumptive
legs
then
for
a
long
moment
she
looks
about
at
the
familiar
objects
with
dying
eyes
that
seem
desirous
to
take
away
with
them
the
memory
of
the
places
they
are
leaving
and
the
door
of
the
apartment
closes
upon
her
with
a
noise
as
of
farewell
she
reaches
the
foot
of
the
stairs
where
she
rests
for
an
instant
on
a
chair
the
concierge
in
a
bantering
tone
assures
her
that
she
will
be
well
in
six
weeks
she
bows
and
says
yes
an
inaudible
yes
the
cab
drives
up
to
the
door
she
rests
her
hand
on
the
concierge
wife
i
hold
her
against
the
pillow
she
has
behind
her
back
with
wide
open
vacant
eyes
she
vaguely
watches
the
houses
pass
but
she
does
not
speak
at
the
door
of
the
hospital
she
tries
to
alight
without
assistance
can
you
walk
so
far
the
concierge
asks
she
makes
an
affirmative
gesture
and
walks
on
really
i
can
not
imagine
where
she
procured
the
strength
to
walk
as
she
does
here
we
are
at
last
in
the
great
hall
a
high
cold
bare
clean
place
with
a
litter
standing
all
ready
for
use
in
the
centre
i
seat
her
in
a
straw
armchair
by
a
door
with
a
glazed
wicket
a
young
man
opens
the
wicket
asks
my
name
and
age
and
writes
busily
for
quarter
of
an
hour
covering
ten
or
more
sheets
of
paper
with
a
religious
figure
at
the
head
at
last
everything
is
ready
and
i
embrace
her
a
boy
takes
one
arm
the
housekeeper
the
after
that
i
saw
nothing
more
august
we
have
been
to
lariboisière
we
found
rose
quiet
hopeful
talking
of
her
approaching
discharge
in
three
weeks
at
most
and
so
free
from
all
thought
of
death
that
she
told
us
of
a
furious
love
scene
that
took
place
yesterday
between
a
woman
in
the
bed
next
hers
and
a
brother
of
the
christian
schools
who
was
there
again
poor
rose
is
death
but
death
engrossed
with
life
near
her
bed
was
a
young
woman
whose
husband
a
mechanic
had
come
to
see
her
you
see
as
soon
as
i
can
walk
i
shall
walk
about
the
garden
so
much
that
they
have
to
send
me
home
she
said
and
the
mother
in
her
added
does
the
child
ask
for
me
sometimes
sometimes
oh
yes
the
man
replied
august
this
morning
at
ten
someone
rings
the
bell
i
hear
a
colloquy
at
the
door
between
the
housekeeper
and
the
concierge
the
door
opens
the
concierge
enters
with
a
letter
i
take
the
letter
it
bears
the
stamp
of
lariboisière
rose
died
this
morning
at
seven
poor
girl
so
it
is
all
over
i
knew
that
she
was
doomed
but
she
was
so
animated
so
cheerful
almost
happy
when
we
saw
her
thursday
and
here
we
are
both
walking
up
and
down
the
salon
filled
with
the
thought
that
a
death
inspires
we
shall
never
see
her
again
an
instinctive
thought
that
recurs
incessantly
within
you
what
a
void
what
a
gap
in
our
household
a
habit
an
attachment
of
years
growth
a
girl
who
knew
our
whole
lives
and
opened
our
letters
in
our
absence
and
to
whom
we
told
all
our
business
when
i
was
a
bit
of
a
boy
i
trundled
my
hoop
with
her
and
she
bought
me
with
her
own
money
when
we
went
to
walk
she
would
sit
up
for
edmond
till
morning
to
open
the
door
for
him
when
he
went
to
the
bal
de
without
our
mother
knowledge
she
was
the
woman
the
excellent
nurse
whose
hands
mother
placed
in
ours
when
she
was
dying
she
had
the
keys
to
everything
she
managed
everything
she
did
everything
for
our
comfort
for
years
she
tucked
us
up
in
bed
every
night
and
every
night
there
were
the
same
jokes
about
her
ugliness
and
her
disgraceful
physique
sorrows
and
joys
alike
she
shared
with
us
she
was
one
of
those
devoted
creatures
upon
whose
solicitude
you
rely
to
close
your
eyes
our
bodies
when
we
were
ill
or
indisposed
were
accustomed
to
her
attentions
she
was
familiar
with
all
our
hobbies
she
had
known
all
our
mistresses
she
was
a
piece
of
our
life
part
of
the
furniture
of
our
apartment
a
stray
memory
of
our
youth
at
once
loving
and
scolding
and
like
a
watchdog
whom
we
were
accustomed
to
having
always
beside
us
and
about
us
and
who
ought
to
last
as
long
as
ourselves
and
we
shall
never
see
her
again
it
is
not
she
moving
about
the
rooms
she
will
never
again
come
to
our
rooms
to
bid
us
it
is
a
great
wrench
a
great
change
in
our
lives
which
seems
to
us
i
can
not
say
why
like
one
of
those
solemn
breaks
in
existence
when
as
byron
says
destiny
changes
horses
august
this
morning
we
are
to
perform
all
the
last
sad
duties
we
must
return
to
the
hospital
enter
once
more
the
reception
hall
where
i
seem
to
see
again
in
the
armchair
against
the
wicket
the
ghost
of
the
emaciated
creature
i
seated
there
less
than
a
week
ago
will
you
identify
the
body
the
attendant
hurls
the
question
at
me
in
a
harsh
voice
we
go
to
the
further
end
of
the
hospital
to
a
high
yellow
door
upon
which
is
written
in
great
black
letters
the
attendant
knocks
after
some
moments
the
door
is
partly
opened
and
a
head
like
a
butcher
boy
appears
with
a
short
pipe
in
its
mouth
a
head
which
suggests
the
gladiator
and
the
i
fancied
that
i
was
at
the
circus
and
that
he
was
the
slave
who
received
the
gladiators
bodies
and
he
does
receive
the
slain
in
that
great
circus
society
they
made
us
wait
a
long
while
before
opening
another
door
and
during
those
moments
of
suspense
all
our
courage
oozed
away
as
the
blood
of
a
wounded
man
who
is
forced
to
remain
standing
oozes
away
drop
by
drop
the
mystery
of
what
we
were
about
to
see
the
horror
of
a
sight
that
rends
your
heart
the
search
for
the
one
body
amid
other
bodies
the
scrutiny
and
recognition
of
that
poor
face
disfigured
doubtless
the
thought
of
all
this
made
us
as
timid
as
children
we
were
at
the
end
of
our
strength
at
the
end
of
our
at
the
end
of
our
nervous
tension
and
when
the
door
opened
we
said
we
will
send
some
one
and
fled
from
there
we
went
to
the
mayor
office
riding
in
a
cab
that
jolted
us
and
shook
our
heads
about
like
empty
things
and
an
indefinable
horror
seized
upon
us
of
death
in
a
hospital
which
seems
to
be
only
an
administrative
formality
one
would
say
that
in
that
abode
of
agony
everything
is
so
well
administered
regulated
reduced
to
system
that
death
opens
it
as
if
it
were
an
administrative
bureau
while
we
were
having
the
death
registered
dieu
the
paper
all
covered
with
writing
and
flourishes
for
a
poor
woman
death
a
man
rushed
out
of
an
adjoining
room
in
joyous
exultation
and
looked
at
the
almanac
hanging
on
the
wall
to
find
the
name
of
the
saint
of
the
day
and
give
it
to
his
child
as
he
passed
the
skirt
of
the
happy
father
coat
swept
the
sheet
on
which
the
death
was
registered
from
the
desk
to
the
floor
when
we
returned
home
we
must
look
through
her
papers
get
her
clothes
together
sort
out
the
clutter
of
phials
bandages
and
innumerable
things
that
sickness
collects
jostle
death
about
in
short
it
was
a
ghastly
thing
to
enter
that
attic
where
the
crumbs
of
bread
from
her
last
meal
were
still
lying
in
the
folds
of
the
bedclothes
i
threw
the
coverlid
up
over
the
bolster
like
a
sheet
over
the
ghost
of
a
dead
man
august
the
chapel
is
beside
the
amphitheatre
in
the
hospital
god
and
the
dead
body
are
neighbors
at
the
mass
said
for
the
poor
woman
beside
her
coffin
two
or
three
others
were
placed
near
by
to
reap
the
benefit
of
the
service
there
was
an
unpleasant
promiscuousness
of
salvation
in
that
performance
it
resembled
the
common
grave
in
the
prayer
behind
me
in
the
chapel
rose
niece
was
weeping
the
little
girl
she
had
at
our
house
for
a
short
time
who
is
now
a
young
woman
of
nineteen
a
pupil
at
the
convent
of
the
sisters
of
a
poor
weazened
pale
stunted
creature
rickety
from
starvation
with
a
head
too
heavy
for
her
body
back
bent
double
and
the
air
of
a
mayeux
the
last
sad
remnant
of
that
family
awaited
by
death
and
with
his
hand
even
now
heavy
upon
her
in
her
soft
eyes
there
is
already
a
gleam
of
the
life
beyond
then
from
the
chapel
to
the
extreme
end
of
the
montmartre
cemetery
vast
as
a
necropolis
and
occupying
a
whole
quarter
of
the
city
walking
at
slow
steps
through
mud
that
never
ends
lastly
the
intoning
of
the
priests
and
the
coffin
laboriously
lowered
by
the
gravediggers
arms
to
the
ends
of
the
ropes
as
a
cask
of
wine
is
lowered
into
a
cellar
august
once
more
i
must
return
to
the
hospital
for
since
the
visit
i
paid
rose
on
thursday
and
her
sudden
death
the
next
day
there
has
existed
for
me
a
mystery
which
i
force
from
my
thoughts
but
which
constantly
returns
the
mystery
of
that
agony
of
which
i
know
nothing
of
that
sudden
end
i
long
to
know
and
i
dread
to
learn
it
does
not
seem
to
me
as
if
she
were
dead
i
think
of
her
simply
as
of
a
person
who
has
disappeared
my
imagination
returns
to
her
last
hours
gropes
for
them
in
the
darkness
and
reconstructs
them
and
they
torture
me
with
their
veiled
horrors
i
need
to
have
my
doubts
resolved
at
last
this
morning
i
took
my
courage
in
both
hands
again
i
see
the
hospital
again
i
see
the
obese
concierge
reeking
with
life
as
one
reeks
with
wine
and
the
corridors
where
the
morning
light
falls
upon
the
pale
faces
of
smiling
convalescents
in
a
distant
corner
i
rang
at
a
door
with
little
white
curtains
it
was
opened
and
i
found
myself
in
a
parlor
where
a
virgin
stood
upon
a
sort
of
altar
between
two
windows
on
the
northern
wall
of
the
room
the
cold
bare
room
there
are
why
i
can
not
explain
two
framed
views
of
vesuvius
wretched
which
seem
to
shiver
and
to
be
entirely
expatriated
there
through
an
open
door
behind
me
from
a
small
room
in
which
the
sun
shines
brightly
i
hear
the
chattering
of
sisters
and
children
childish
joys
pretty
little
bursts
of
laughter
all
sorts
of
fresh
clear
vocal
notes
a
sound
as
from
a
dovecote
bathed
in
the
sun
sisters
in
white
with
black
caps
pass
and
repass
one
stops
in
front
of
my
chair
she
is
short
badly
developed
with
an
ugly
sweet
face
a
poor
face
by
the
grace
of
god
she
is
the
mother
of
the
salle
she
tells
me
how
rose
died
in
hardly
any
pain
feeling
that
she
was
improving
almost
well
overflowing
with
encouragement
and
hope
in
the
morning
after
her
bed
was
made
without
any
suspicion
that
death
was
near
suddenly
she
was
taken
with
a
hemorrhage
which
lasted
some
few
seconds
i
came
away
much
comforted
delivered
from
the
thought
that
she
had
had
the
anticipatory
taste
of
death
the
horror
of
its
approach
october
in
the
midst
of
our
dinner
which
was
rendered
melancholy
enough
by
the
constant
hovering
of
the
conversation
around
the
subject
of
death
maria
who
came
to
dinner
cried
out
after
two
or
three
nervous
blows
with
her
fingers
upon
her
fluffy
blonde
locks
my
friends
while
the
poor
girl
was
alive
i
kept
the
professional
secret
of
my
trade
but
now
that
she
is
under
ground
you
must
know
the
truth
and
thereupon
we
learned
things
concerning
the
unhappy
creature
that
took
away
our
appetites
leaving
in
our
mouths
the
bitter
taste
of
fruit
cut
with
a
steel
knife
and
a
whole
strange
hateful
repugnant
deplorable
existence
was
revealed
to
us
the
notes
she
signed
the
debts
she
has
left
behind
her
at
all
the
dealers
have
the
most
unforeseen
the
most
amazing
the
most
incredible
basis
she
kept
men
the
milkwoman
son
for
whom
she
furnished
a
chamber
another
to
whom
she
carried
our
wine
chickens
food
of
all
sorts
a
secret
life
of
nocturnal
orgies
of
nights
passed
abroad
of
fierce
nymphomania
that
made
her
lovers
say
either
she
or
i
will
stay
on
the
field
a
passion
passions
with
her
whole
head
and
heart
and
all
her
senses
at
once
and
complicated
by
all
the
wretched
creatures
diseases
consumption
which
adds
frenzy
to
pleasure
hysteria
the
beginning
of
insanity
she
had
two
children
by
the
milkwoman
son
one
of
whom
lived
six
months
some
years
ago
when
she
told
us
that
she
was
going
on
a
visit
to
her
province
it
was
to
lie
in
and
with
regard
to
these
men
her
passion
was
so
extravagant
so
unhealthy
so
insane
that
she
who
was
formerly
honesty
personified
actually
stole
from
us
took
twenty
franc
pieces
out
of
rolls
of
a
hundred
francs
so
that
the
lovers
she
paid
might
not
leave
her
now
after
these
involuntarily
dishonest
acts
these
petty
crimes
extorted
from
her
upright
nature
she
plunged
into
such
depths
of
remorse
melancholy
such
black
despair
that
in
that
hell
in
which
she
rolled
on
from
sin
to
sin
desperate
and
unsatisfied
she
had
taken
to
drinking
to
escape
herself
to
save
herself
from
the
present
to
drown
herself
and
founder
for
a
few
moments
in
the
heavy
slumber
the
lethargic
torpor
in
which
she
would
lie
wallowing
across
her
bed
for
a
whole
day
just
as
she
fell
when
she
tried
to
make
it
the
miserable
creature
how
great
an
incentive
how
many
motives
and
reasons
she
found
for
devouring
her
suffering
and
bleeding
internally
in
the
first
place
the
rejection
at
intervals
of
religious
ideas
by
the
terrors
of
a
hell
of
fire
and
brimstone
then
jealousy
that
characteristic
jealousy
of
everything
and
everybody
that
poisoned
her
life
then
then
then
the
disgust
which
these
men
after
a
time
brutally
expressed
for
her
ugliness
and
which
drove
her
deeper
and
deeper
into
sottishness
caused
her
one
day
to
have
a
miscarriage
and
she
fell
half
dead
on
the
floor
such
a
frightful
tearing
away
of
the
veil
we
have
worn
over
our
eyes
is
like
the
examination
of
a
pocketful
of
horrible
things
in
a
dead
body
suddenly
opened
from
what
we
have
heard
i
suddenly
seem
to
realize
what
she
must
have
suffered
for
ten
years
past
the
dread
of
an
anonymous
letter
to
us
or
of
a
denunciation
from
some
dealer
and
the
constant
trepidation
on
the
subject
of
the
money
that
was
demanded
of
her
and
that
she
could
not
pay
and
the
shame
felt
by
that
proud
creature
perverted
by
the
vile
quartier
because
of
her
intimacy
with
low
wretches
whom
she
despised
and
the
lamentable
consciousness
of
the
premature
senility
caused
by
drunkenness
and
the
inhuman
exactions
and
brutality
of
the
alphonses
of
the
gutter
and
the
temptations
to
suicide
which
caused
me
to
pull
her
away
from
a
window
one
day
when
i
found
her
leaning
far
out
and
lastly
all
the
tears
that
we
believed
to
be
without
cause
all
these
things
mingled
with
a
very
deep
and
heartfelt
affection
for
us
and
with
a
vehement
feverish
devotion
when
either
of
us
was
and
this
woman
possessed
an
energetic
character
a
force
of
will
a
skill
in
mystification
to
which
nothing
can
be
compared
yes
yes
all
those
frightful
secrets
kept
under
lock
and
key
hidden
buried
deep
in
her
own
heart
so
that
neither
our
eyes
nor
our
ears
nor
our
powers
of
observation
ever
detected
aught
amiss
even
in
her
hysterical
attacks
when
nothing
escaped
her
but
groans
a
mystery
preserved
until
her
death
and
which
she
must
have
believed
would
be
buried
with
her
and
of
what
did
she
die
she
died
because
all
through
one
rainy
night
eight
months
ago
at
montmartre
she
spied
upon
the
son
who
had
turned
her
away
in
order
to
find
out
with
what
woman
he
had
filled
her
place
a
whole
night
leaning
against
a
window
as
a
result
of
which
she
was
drenched
to
the
bones
with
deadly
pleurisy
poor
creature
we
forgive
her
indeed
a
vast
compassion
for
her
fills
our
hearts
as
we
reflect
upon
all
that
she
has
suffered
but
we
have
become
suspicious
for
our
lives
of
the
whole
female
sex
and
of
women
above
us
as
well
as
of
women
below
us
in
station
we
are
at
the
double
lining
of
their
hearts
at
the
marvelous
faculty
the
science
the
consummate
genius
of
falsehood
with
which
their
whole
being
is
instinct
the
above
extracts
are
from
our
journal
journal
des
goncourts
de
la
vie
they
are
the
documentary
foundation
upon
which
two
years
later
my
brother
and
i
composed
germinie
lacerteux
whom
we
made
a
study
of
and
taught
when
she
was
in
the
service
of
our
venerable
cousin
mademoiselle
de
c
t
of
whom
we
were
writing
a
veracious
biography
after
the
style
of
a
biography
of
modern
history
edmond
de
goncourt
april
i
saved
so
you
are
really
out
of
danger
mademoiselle
exclaimed
the
maid
with
a
cry
of
joy
as
she
closed
the
door
upon
the
doctor
and
rushing
to
the
bed
on
which
her
mistress
lay
she
began
in
a
frenzy
of
happiness
and
with
a
shower
of
kisses
to
embrace
together
with
the
bed
covers
the
old
woman
poor
emaciated
body
which
seemed
in
the
huge
bed
as
small
as
a
child
the
old
woman
took
her
head
silently
in
both
hands
pressed
it
against
her
heart
heaved
a
sigh
and
muttered
ah
well
so
i
must
live
on
this
took
place
in
a
small
room
through
the
window
of
which
could
be
seen
a
small
patch
of
sky
cut
by
three
black
iron
pipes
various
neighboring
roofs
and
in
the
distance
between
two
houses
that
almost
touched
the
leafless
branch
of
a
tree
whose
trunk
was
invisible
on
the
mantelpiece
in
a
mahogany
box
was
a
square
clock
with
a
large
dial
huge
figures
and
bulky
hands
beside
it
under
glass
covers
were
two
candlesticks
formed
by
three
silver
swans
twisting
their
necks
around
a
golden
quiver
near
the
fireplace
an
easy
chair
la
covered
with
one
of
the
pieces
of
tapestry
of
pattern
which
little
girls
and
old
women
make
extended
its
empty
arms
two
little
italian
landscapes
a
flower
piece
in
after
bertin
with
a
date
in
red
ink
at
the
bottom
and
a
few
miniatures
hung
on
the
walls
upon
the
mahogany
commode
of
an
empire
pattern
a
statue
of
time
in
black
bronze
running
with
his
scythe
in
rest
served
as
a
watch
stand
for
a
small
watch
with
a
monogram
in
diamonds
upon
blue
enamel
surrounded
with
pearls
the
floor
was
covered
with
a
bright
carpet
with
black
and
green
stripes
the
curtains
at
the
bed
and
the
window
were
of
chintz
with
red
figures
upon
a
chocolate
ground
at
the
head
of
the
bed
a
portrait
inclined
over
the
invalid
and
seemed
to
gaze
sternly
at
her
it
represented
a
man
with
harsh
features
whose
face
emerged
from
the
high
collar
of
a
green
satin
coat
and
a
muslin
cravat
with
waving
ends
tied
loosely
around
the
neck
in
the
style
of
the
early
years
of
the
revolution
the
old
woman
in
the
bed
resembled
the
portrait
she
had
the
same
bushy
commanding
black
eyebrows
the
same
aquiline
nose
the
same
clearly
marked
lines
of
will
resolution
and
energy
the
portrait
seemed
to
cast
a
reflection
upon
her
as
a
father
face
is
reflected
in
his
child
but
in
hers
the
harshness
of
the
features
was
softened
by
a
gleam
of
rough
kindliness
by
an
indefinable
flame
of
sturdy
devotion
and
masculine
charity
the
light
in
the
room
was
the
light
of
an
evening
in
early
spring
about
five
a
light
as
clear
as
crystal
and
as
white
as
silver
the
cold
chaste
soft
light
which
fades
away
in
the
flush
of
the
sunset
passing
into
twilight
the
sky
was
filled
with
that
light
of
a
new
life
adorably
melancholy
like
the
still
naked
earth
and
so
replete
with
pathos
that
it
moves
happy
souls
to
tears
well
well
my
silly
germinie
weeping
said
the
old
woman
a
moment
later
withdrawing
her
hands
which
were
moist
with
her
maid
kisses
oh
my
dear
kind
mademoiselle
i
would
like
to
weep
like
this
all
the
time
it
so
good
it
brings
my
poor
mother
back
before
my
eyes
and
everything
if
you
only
knew
go
on
go
on
said
her
mistress
closing
her
eyes
to
listen
tell
me
about
it
oh
my
poor
mother
the
maid
paused
a
moment
then
with
the
flood
of
words
that
gushes
forth
with
tears
of
joy
she
continued
as
if
in
the
emotion
and
outpouring
of
her
happiness
her
whole
childhood
flowed
back
into
her
heart
poor
woman
i
can
see
her
now
the
last
time
she
went
out
to
take
me
to
mass
one
of
january
i
remember
in
those
days
they
read
from
the
king
testament
ah
she
suffered
enough
on
my
account
did
mamma
she
was
years
old
when
i
was
born
papa
made
her
cry
a
good
deal
there
were
three
of
us
before
and
there
any
too
much
bread
in
the
house
and
then
he
was
proud
as
anything
if
we
had
only
a
handful
of
peas
in
the
house
he
would
never
have
gone
to
the
curé
for
help
ah
we
did
eat
bacon
every
day
at
our
house
never
mind
for
all
that
mamma
loved
me
a
little
more
and
she
always
found
a
little
fat
or
cheese
in
some
corner
to
put
on
my
bread
i
was
five
when
she
died
that
was
a
bad
thing
for
us
all
i
had
a
tall
brother
who
was
white
as
a
sheet
with
a
yellow
beard
and
good
you
have
no
idea
everybody
loved
him
they
gave
him
all
sorts
of
names
some
called
him
boda
why
i
do
know
others
called
him
jesus
christ
ah
he
was
a
worker
he
was
it
did
make
any
difference
to
him
that
his
health
was
good
for
nothing
at
daybreak
he
was
always
at
his
loom
for
we
were
weavers
you
must
know
and
he
never
put
his
shuttle
down
till
night
and
honest
too
if
you
knew
people
came
from
all
about
to
bring
him
their
yarn
and
without
weighing
it
too
he
was
a
great
friend
of
the
schoolmaster
and
he
used
to
write
the
for
the
carnival
my
father
he
was
a
different
sort
he
work
for
a
moment
or
an
hour
you
know
and
then
he
go
off
into
the
fields
and
when
he
came
home
beat
us
and
beat
us
hard
he
was
like
a
madman
they
said
it
was
because
he
was
consumptive
it
was
lucky
my
brother
was
there
he
used
to
prevent
my
second
sister
from
pulling
my
hair
and
hurting
me
because
she
was
jealous
he
always
took
me
by
the
hand
to
go
and
see
them
play
skittles
in
fact
he
supported
the
family
all
alone
for
my
first
communion
he
had
the
bells
rung
ah
he
did
a
heap
of
work
so
that
i
should
be
like
the
others
in
a
little
white
dress
with
flounces
and
a
little
bag
in
my
hand
such
as
they
used
to
carry
in
those
days
i
did
have
any
cap
i
remember
making
myself
a
pretty
little
wreath
of
ribbons
and
the
white
pith
you
pull
off
when
you
strip
reeds
there
was
lots
of
it
in
the
places
where
we
used
to
put
the
hemp
to
soak
that
was
one
of
my
great
days
that
and
the
drawing
lots
for
the
pigs
at
christmas
and
the
days
when
i
went
to
help
them
tie
up
the
vines
that
was
in
june
you
know
we
had
a
little
vineyard
near
saint
hilaire
there
was
one
very
hard
year
in
those
days
do
you
remember
it
mademoiselle
the
long
frost
of
that
ruined
everything
it
extended
as
far
as
dijon
and
farther
too
people
had
to
make
bread
from
bran
my
brother
nearly
killed
himself
with
work
father
who
was
always
out
of
doors
tramping
about
the
fields
sometimes
brought
home
a
few
mushrooms
it
was
pretty
bad
all
the
same
we
were
hungry
oftener
than
anything
else
when
i
was
out
in
the
fields
myself
i
look
around
to
see
if
anyone
could
see
me
and
then
i
crawl
along
softly
on
my
knees
and
when
i
was
under
a
cow
i
take
off
one
of
my
sabots
and
begin
to
milk
her
bless
me
i
came
near
being
caught
at
it
my
oldest
sister
was
out
at
service
with
the
mayor
of
lenclos
and
she
sent
home
her
wages
francs
it
was
always
as
much
as
that
the
second
worked
at
dressmaking
in
bourgeois
families
but
they
did
pay
the
prices
then
that
they
do
she
worked
from
six
in
the
morning
till
dark
for
eight
sous
out
of
that
she
wanted
to
put
some
by
for
a
dress
for
the
fête
on
ah
that
the
way
it
is
with
us
there
are
many
who
live
on
two
potatoes
a
day
for
six
months
so
as
to
have
a
new
dress
for
that
day
bad
luck
fell
on
us
on
all
sides
my
father
died
we
had
to
sell
a
small
field
and
a
bit
of
a
vineyard
that
yielded
a
cask
of
wine
every
year
the
notaries
do
work
for
nothing
when
my
brother
was
sick
there
was
nothing
to
give
him
to
drink
but
that
we
been
putting
water
to
for
a
year
and
there
was
any
change
of
linen
for
him
all
the
sheets
in
the
wardrobe
which
had
a
golden
cross
on
top
of
it
in
mother
time
had
gone
and
the
cross
too
more
than
that
before
he
was
sick
this
time
my
brother
goes
off
to
the
fête
at
clefmont
he
hears
someone
say
that
my
sister
had
gone
wrong
with
the
mayor
she
worked
for
he
falls
on
the
men
who
said
it
but
he
was
very
strong
they
were
though
and
they
threw
him
down
and
when
he
was
down
they
kicked
him
with
their
wooden
shoes
in
the
pit
of
the
stomach
he
was
brought
home
to
us
for
dead
the
doctor
put
him
on
his
feet
again
though
and
told
us
he
was
cured
but
he
could
just
drag
himself
along
i
could
see
that
he
was
going
when
he
kissed
me
when
he
was
dead
poor
dear
boy
cadet
ballard
had
to
use
all
his
strength
to
take
me
away
from
the
body
the
whole
village
mayor
and
all
went
to
his
funeral
as
my
sister
could
keep
her
place
with
the
mayor
on
account
of
the
things
he
said
to
her
and
had
gone
to
paris
to
find
a
place
my
other
sister
went
after
her
i
was
left
all
alone
one
of
my
mother
cousins
then
took
me
with
her
to
damblin
but
i
was
all
upset
there
i
cried
all
night
long
and
whenever
i
could
run
away
i
always
went
back
to
our
house
just
to
see
the
old
vine
at
our
door
from
the
end
of
the
street
did
me
good
it
put
strength
into
my
legs
the
good
people
who
had
bought
the
house
would
keep
me
till
someone
came
for
me
they
were
always
sure
to
find
me
there
at
last
they
wrote
to
my
sister
in
paris
that
if
she
did
send
for
me
to
come
and
live
with
her
i
was
likely
to
live
long
it
a
fact
that
i
was
just
like
wax
they
put
me
in
charge
of
the
driver
of
a
small
wagon
that
went
from
langres
to
paris
every
month
and
that
how
i
came
to
paris
i
was
fourteen
years
old
then
i
remember
that
i
went
to
bed
all
dressed
all
the
way
because
they
made
me
sleep
in
the
common
room
when
i
arrived
i
was
covered
with
lice
ii
the
old
woman
said
nothing
she
was
comparing
her
own
life
with
her
servant
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
was
born
in
she
first
saw
the
light
in
a
mansion
on
rue
royale
and
mesdames
de
france
were
her
sponsors
in
baptism
her
father
was
a
close
friend
of
the
comte
in
whose
household
he
held
an
important
post
he
joined
in
all
his
and
was
one
of
the
few
familiar
spirits
in
whose
presence
at
the
mass
preceding
the
hunt
he
who
was
one
day
to
be
king
charles
used
to
hurry
the
officiating
priest
by
saying
in
an
undertone
psit
psit
curé
swallow
your
quickly
monsieur
de
varandeuil
had
made
one
of
those
marriages
which
were
customary
enough
in
his
day
he
had
espoused
a
sort
of
actress
a
singer
who
although
she
had
no
great
talent
had
made
a
success
at
the
beside
madame
todi
madame
ponteuil
and
madame
the
little
girl
born
of
this
marriage
in
was
sickly
and
delicate
ugly
of
feature
with
a
nose
even
then
large
enough
to
be
absurd
her
father
nose
in
a
face
as
thin
as
a
man
wrist
she
had
nothing
of
what
her
parents
vanity
would
have
liked
her
to
have
after
making
a
fiasco
on
the
piano
at
the
age
of
five
at
a
concert
given
by
her
mother
in
her
salon
she
was
relegated
to
the
society
of
the
servants
except
for
a
moment
in
the
morning
she
never
went
near
her
mother
who
always
made
her
kiss
her
under
the
chin
so
that
she
might
not
disturb
her
rouge
when
the
revolution
arrived
monsieur
de
varandeuil
thanks
to
the
comte
patronage
was
disburser
of
pensions
madame
de
varandeuil
was
traveling
in
italy
whither
she
had
ordered
her
physician
to
send
her
on
the
pretext
of
ill
health
leaving
her
daughter
and
an
infant
son
in
her
husband
charge
the
absorbing
anxiety
of
the
times
the
tempests
threatening
wealth
and
the
families
that
handled
wealth
monsieur
de
varandeuil
brother
was
a
left
that
very
selfish
and
unloving
father
but
little
leisure
to
attend
to
the
wants
of
his
children
thereupon
he
began
to
be
somewhat
embarrassed
pecuniarily
he
left
rue
royale
and
took
up
his
abode
at
the
hôtel
du
belonging
to
his
mother
who
allowed
him
to
install
himself
there
events
moved
rapidly
one
evening
in
the
early
days
of
the
guillotine
as
he
was
walking
along
rue
he
heard
a
hawker
in
front
of
him
crying
the
journal
voleurs
aux
voleurs
according
to
the
usual
custom
of
those
days
he
gave
a
list
of
the
articles
contained
in
the
number
he
had
for
sale
monsieur
de
varandeuil
heard
his
own
name
mingled
with
oaths
and
obscenity
he
bought
the
paper
and
read
therein
a
revolutionary
denunciation
of
himself
some
time
after
his
brother
was
arrested
and
detained
at
hôtel
talaru
with
the
other
his
mother
in
a
paroxysm
of
terror
had
foolishly
sold
the
hôtel
du
where
he
was
living
for
the
value
of
the
mirrors
she
was
paid
in
and
died
of
despair
over
the
constant
depreciation
of
the
paper
luckily
monsieur
de
varandeuil
obtained
from
the
purchasers
who
could
find
no
tenants
leave
to
occupy
the
rooms
formerly
used
by
the
stableboys
he
took
refuge
there
among
the
outbuildings
of
the
mansion
stripped
himself
of
his
name
and
posted
at
the
door
as
he
was
ordered
to
do
his
family
name
of
roulot
under
which
he
buried
the
and
the
former
courtier
of
the
comte
he
lived
there
alone
buried
forgotten
hiding
his
head
never
going
out
cowering
in
his
hole
without
servants
waited
upon
by
his
daughter
to
whom
he
left
everything
the
terror
was
to
them
a
period
of
shuddering
suspense
the
breathless
excitement
of
impending
death
every
evening
the
little
girl
went
and
listened
at
a
grated
window
to
the
day
crop
of
condemnations
the
of
prize
winners
in
the
lottery
of
saint
she
answered
every
knock
at
the
door
thinking
that
they
had
come
to
take
her
father
to
the
place
de
la
révolution
whither
her
uncle
had
already
been
taken
the
moment
came
when
money
the
money
that
was
so
scarce
no
longer
procured
bread
it
was
necessary
to
go
and
get
it
almost
by
force
at
the
doors
of
the
bakeries
it
was
necessary
to
earn
it
by
standing
for
hours
in
the
cold
biting
night
air
in
the
crushing
pressure
of
crowds
of
people
to
stand
in
line
from
three
in
the
morning
the
father
did
not
care
to
venture
into
that
mass
of
humanity
he
was
afraid
of
being
recognized
of
compromising
himself
by
one
of
those
outbursts
to
which
his
impetuous
nature
would
have
given
vent
no
matter
where
he
might
be
then
too
he
recoiled
from
the
fatigue
and
severity
of
the
task
the
little
boy
was
still
too
small
he
would
have
been
crushed
so
the
duty
of
obtaining
bread
for
three
mouths
each
day
fell
to
the
daughter
she
obtained
it
with
her
little
thin
body
fairly
lost
in
her
father
knitted
jacket
a
cotton
cap
pulled
down
over
her
eyes
her
limbs
all
huddled
together
to
retain
a
little
warmth
she
would
wait
shivering
her
eyes
aching
with
cold
amid
the
pushing
and
buffeting
until
the
baker
wife
on
rue
des
placed
in
her
hands
a
loaf
which
her
little
fingers
stiff
with
cold
could
hardly
hold
at
last
this
poor
little
creature
who
returned
day
after
day
with
her
pinched
face
and
her
emaciated
trembling
body
moved
the
baker
wife
to
pity
with
the
kindness
of
heart
of
a
woman
of
the
people
she
would
send
the
coveted
loaf
to
the
little
one
by
her
boy
as
soon
as
she
appeared
in
the
long
line
but
one
day
just
as
she
put
out
her
hand
to
take
it
a
woman
whose
jealousy
was
aroused
by
this
mark
of
favor
and
preference
dealt
the
child
a
kick
with
her
wooden
shoe
which
kept
her
in
bed
almost
a
month
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
bore
the
marks
of
the
blow
all
her
life
during
that
month
the
whole
family
would
have
died
of
starvation
had
it
not
been
for
a
supply
of
rice
which
one
of
their
acquaintances
the
comtesse
had
had
the
forethought
to
lay
aside
and
which
she
consented
to
share
with
the
father
and
the
two
children
thus
monsieur
de
varandeuil
escaped
the
revolutionary
tribunal
by
burying
himself
in
obscurity
he
escaped
it
also
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
accounts
of
his
administration
of
his
office
were
still
unsettled
as
he
had
had
the
good
fortune
to
procure
the
postponement
of
the
settlement
from
month
to
month
then
too
he
kept
suspicion
at
bay
by
his
personal
animosity
toward
some
great
personages
at
court
and
by
the
hatred
of
the
queen
which
many
retainers
of
the
king
brothers
had
conceived
whenever
he
had
occasion
to
speak
of
that
wretched
woman
he
used
violent
bitter
insulting
words
uttered
in
such
a
passionate
sincere
tone
that
they
almost
made
him
appear
as
an
enemy
of
the
royal
family
so
that
those
to
whom
he
was
simply
citizen
roulot
looked
upon
him
as
a
good
patriot
and
those
who
knew
his
former
name
almost
excused
him
for
having
been
what
he
had
been
a
noble
the
friend
of
a
prince
of
the
blood
and
a
place
holder
the
republic
had
reached
the
epoch
of
patriotic
suppers
those
repasts
of
a
whole
street
in
the
street
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
in
her
confused
terrified
reminiscences
of
those
days
could
still
see
the
tables
on
rue
pavée
with
their
legs
in
the
streams
of
the
blood
of
september
flowing
from
la
force
it
was
at
one
of
these
suppers
that
monsieur
de
varandeuil
conceived
a
scheme
that
completely
assured
his
immunity
he
informed
two
of
his
neighbors
at
table
devoted
patriots
both
one
of
whom
was
on
intimate
terms
with
chaumette
that
he
was
in
great
embarrassment
because
his
daughter
had
been
privately
baptized
only
so
that
she
had
no
civil
status
and
said
that
he
would
be
very
happy
if
chaumette
would
have
her
entered
on
the
registers
of
the
municipality
and
honor
her
with
a
name
selected
by
him
from
the
republican
calendar
of
greece
or
rome
chaumette
at
once
arranged
a
meeting
with
this
father
had
reached
so
high
a
as
they
said
in
those
days
during
the
interview
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
was
taken
into
a
closet
where
she
found
two
women
who
were
instructed
to
satisfy
themselves
as
to
her
sex
and
she
showed
them
her
breast
they
then
escorted
her
to
the
great
salle
des
declarations
and
there
after
a
metaphorical
allocution
chaumette
baptized
her
a
name
which
habit
was
destined
to
fasten
upon
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
and
which
she
never
abandoned
somewhat
protected
and
reassured
by
that
episode
the
family
passed
through
the
terrible
days
preceding
the
fall
of
robespierre
at
last
came
the
ninth
thermidor
and
deliverance
but
poverty
was
none
the
less
a
pressing
fact
in
the
varandeuil
household
they
had
not
lived
through
the
bitter
days
of
the
revolution
they
were
not
to
live
through
the
wretched
days
of
the
directory
without
succor
money
sent
by
providence
by
the
hand
of
folly
the
father
and
the
two
children
could
hardly
have
existed
without
the
income
from
four
shares
in
the
an
investment
which
monsieur
de
varandeuil
was
happily
inspired
to
make
in
and
which
proved
to
be
the
best
of
all
possible
investments
in
those
years
of
death
when
people
felt
the
need
of
forgetting
death
every
evening
in
those
days
of
supreme
agony
when
everyone
wished
to
laugh
his
last
laugh
at
the
latest
song
soon
these
shares
added
to
the
amount
of
some
outstanding
claims
that
were
paid
provided
the
family
with
something
more
than
bread
they
thereupon
left
the
eaves
of
the
hôtel
du
and
took
a
small
suite
in
the
marais
on
rue
du
chaume
no
change
took
place
however
in
the
habits
of
the
household
the
daughter
continued
to
wait
upon
her
father
and
brother
monsieur
de
varandeuil
had
gradually
become
accustomed
to
see
in
her
only
the
woman
indicated
by
her
costume
and
by
the
work
that
she
did
the
father
eyes
did
not
care
to
recognize
a
daughter
in
that
servant
garb
and
in
her
performance
of
menial
occupations
she
was
no
longer
a
person
with
his
blood
in
her
veins
or
who
had
the
honor
to
belong
to
him
she
was
a
servant
and
his
selfishness
confirmed
him
so
fully
in
that
idea
and
in
his
harsh
treatment
of
her
he
found
that
filial
affectionate
respectful
service
which
cost
nothing
at
all
by
the
way
so
convenient
that
it
cost
him
a
bitter
pang
to
give
it
up
later
when
a
little
more
money
mended
the
family
fortunes
battles
had
to
be
fought
to
induce
him
to
take
a
maid
to
fill
his
child
place
and
to
relieve
the
girl
from
the
most
humiliating
domestic
labor
they
were
without
information
concerning
madame
de
varandeuil
who
had
refused
to
join
her
husband
at
paris
during
the
early
years
of
the
revolution
at
last
they
learned
that
she
had
married
again
in
germany
producing
as
a
certificate
of
her
husband
death
the
death
certificate
of
his
guillotined
brother
the
baptismal
name
having
been
changed
the
girl
grew
up
therefore
abandoned
without
affection
with
no
mother
except
a
woman
dead
to
her
family
whom
her
father
taught
her
to
despise
her
childhood
was
passed
in
constant
anxiety
in
the
privations
that
wear
life
away
in
the
fatigue
resulting
from
labor
that
exhausted
the
strength
of
a
sickly
child
in
an
expectation
of
death
that
became
at
last
an
impatient
longing
to
die
there
had
been
hours
when
that
girl
of
thirteen
was
tempted
to
do
as
many
women
did
in
those
days
to
open
the
door
and
rush
into
the
street
crying
le
roi
in
order
to
end
it
all
her
girlhood
was
a
continuation
of
her
childhood
with
less
tragic
motives
of
weariness
she
had
to
submit
to
the
ill
humor
the
exactions
the
bitter
moods
the
tempestuous
outbreaks
of
her
father
which
had
been
hitherto
somewhat
curbed
and
restrained
by
the
great
tempest
of
the
time
she
was
still
doomed
to
undergo
the
fatigues
and
humiliations
of
a
servant
she
remained
alone
with
her
father
kept
down
and
humbled
shut
out
from
his
arms
and
his
kisses
her
heart
heavy
with
grief
because
she
longed
to
love
and
had
nothing
to
love
she
was
beginning
to
suffer
from
the
cold
void
that
is
formed
about
a
woman
by
an
unattractive
unfascinating
girlhood
by
a
girlhood
devoid
of
beauty
and
sympathetic
charm
she
could
see
that
she
aroused
a
sort
of
compassion
with
her
long
nose
her
yellow
complexion
her
angular
figure
her
thin
body
she
felt
that
she
was
ugly
and
that
her
ugliness
was
made
repulsive
by
her
miserable
costumes
her
dismal
woolen
dresses
which
she
made
herself
her
father
paying
for
the
material
only
after
much
grumbling
she
could
not
induce
him
to
make
her
a
small
allowance
for
her
toilet
until
she
was
how
sad
and
bitter
and
lonely
for
her
was
her
life
with
that
morose
sour
old
man
who
was
always
scolding
and
complaining
at
home
affable
only
in
society
and
who
left
her
every
evening
to
go
to
the
great
houses
that
were
reopened
under
the
directory
and
at
the
beginning
of
the
empire
only
at
very
long
intervals
did
he
take
her
out
and
when
he
did
it
was
always
to
that
everlasting
where
he
had
boxes
even
on
those
rare
occasions
his
daughter
was
terrified
she
trembled
all
the
time
that
she
was
with
him
she
was
afraid
of
his
violent
disposition
of
the
tone
of
the
old
régime
that
his
outbreaks
of
wrath
had
retained
of
the
facility
with
which
he
would
raise
his
cane
at
an
insolent
remark
from
the
on
almost
every
occasion
there
were
scenes
with
the
manager
wordy
disputes
with
people
in
the
pit
and
threats
of
personal
violence
to
which
she
put
an
end
by
lowering
the
curtain
of
the
box
the
same
thing
was
kept
up
in
the
street
even
in
the
cab
with
the
driver
who
would
refuse
to
carry
them
at
monsieur
de
varandeuil
price
and
would
keep
them
waiting
one
hour
two
hours
without
moving
sometimes
would
unharness
his
horse
in
his
wrath
and
leave
him
in
the
vehicle
with
his
daughter
who
would
vainly
implore
him
to
submit
and
pay
the
price
demanded
considering
that
these
diversions
should
suffice
for
sempronie
and
having
moreover
a
jealous
desire
to
have
her
all
to
himself
and
always
under
his
hand
monsieur
de
varandeuil
allowed
her
to
form
no
intimacies
with
anybody
he
did
not
take
her
into
society
he
did
not
take
her
to
the
houses
of
their
kinsfolk
who
returned
after
the
emigration
except
on
days
of
formal
receptions
or
family
gatherings
he
kept
her
closely
confined
to
the
house
not
until
she
was
forty
did
he
consider
that
she
was
old
enough
to
be
allowed
to
go
out
alone
thus
the
girl
had
no
friendship
no
connection
of
any
sort
to
lean
upon
indeed
she
no
longer
had
her
younger
brother
with
her
as
he
had
gone
to
the
united
states
and
enlisted
in
the
american
navy
she
was
forbidden
by
her
father
to
marry
he
did
not
admit
that
she
would
allow
herself
even
to
think
of
marrying
and
deserting
him
all
the
suitors
who
might
have
come
forward
he
fought
and
rejected
in
advance
in
order
not
to
leave
his
daughter
the
courage
to
speak
to
him
on
the
subject
if
the
occasion
should
ever
arise
meanwhile
our
victories
were
stripping
italy
of
her
treasures
the
masterpieces
of
rome
florence
and
venice
were
hurrying
to
paris
italian
art
was
at
a
premium
collectors
no
longer
took
pride
in
any
paintings
but
those
of
the
italian
school
monsieur
de
varandeuil
saw
an
opening
for
a
fortune
in
this
change
of
taste
he
also
had
fallen
a
victim
to
the
artistic
dilettantism
which
was
one
of
the
refined
passions
of
the
nobility
before
the
revolution
he
had
lived
in
the
society
of
artists
and
collectors
he
admired
pictures
it
occurred
to
him
to
collect
a
gallery
of
italian
works
and
then
to
sell
them
paris
was
still
overrun
with
the
objects
of
art
sold
and
scattered
under
the
terror
monsieur
de
varandeuil
began
to
walk
back
and
forth
through
the
streets
they
were
the
markets
for
large
canvases
in
those
days
and
at
every
step
he
made
a
discovery
every
day
he
purchased
something
soon
the
small
apartment
was
crowded
with
old
black
paintings
so
large
for
the
most
part
that
the
walls
would
not
hold
them
with
their
frames
with
the
result
that
there
was
no
room
for
the
furniture
these
were
christened
raphael
vinci
or
andrea
del
sarto
there
were
none
but
and
the
father
would
keep
his
daughter
standing
in
front
of
them
hours
at
a
time
forcing
his
admiration
upon
her
wearying
her
with
his
ecstatic
flights
he
would
ascend
from
epithet
to
epithet
would
work
himself
into
a
state
of
intoxication
of
delirium
and
would
end
by
thinking
that
he
was
negotiating
with
an
imaginary
purchaser
would
dispute
with
him
over
the
price
of
a
masterpiece
and
would
cry
out
a
hundred
thousand
francs
for
my
rosso
yes
monsieur
a
hundred
thousand
francs
his
daughter
dismayed
by
the
large
amount
of
money
that
those
great
ugly
things
in
which
there
were
so
many
nude
men
deducted
from
the
housekeeping
supply
ventured
upon
remonstrance
and
tried
to
check
such
ruinous
extravagance
monsieur
de
varandeuil
lost
his
temper
waxed
wroth
like
a
man
who
was
ashamed
to
find
one
of
his
blood
so
deficient
in
taste
and
told
her
that
that
was
her
fortune
and
that
she
would
see
later
if
he
was
an
old
fool
at
last
she
induced
him
to
realize
the
sale
took
place
it
was
a
failure
one
of
the
most
complete
shipwrecks
of
illusions
that
the
glazed
hall
of
the
hôtel
bullion
has
ever
seen
stung
to
the
quick
furious
with
rage
at
this
blow
which
not
only
involved
pecuniary
loss
and
a
serious
inroad
upon
his
little
fortune
but
was
also
a
direct
denial
of
his
claims
to
connoisseurship
a
slap
at
his
knowledge
of
art
delivered
upon
the
cheek
of
his
raphaels
monsieur
de
varandeuil
informed
his
daughter
that
they
were
too
poor
to
remain
in
paris
and
that
they
must
go
into
the
provinces
to
live
having
been
cradled
and
reared
in
an
epoch
little
adapted
to
inspire
a
love
of
country
life
in
women
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
tried
vainly
to
combat
her
father
resolution
she
was
obliged
to
go
with
him
wherever
he
chose
to
go
and
by
leaving
paris
to
lose
the
society
and
friendship
of
two
young
kinswomen
to
whom
in
their
too
infrequent
interviews
she
had
partly
given
her
confidence
and
whose
hearts
she
had
felt
reaching
out
to
her
as
to
an
older
sister
monsieur
de
varandeuil
hired
a
small
house
at
there
he
was
near
familiar
scenes
in
the
atmosphere
of
what
was
formerly
a
little
court
close
at
hand
to
two
or
three
châteaux
whose
owners
he
knew
and
which
were
beginning
to
throw
open
their
doors
once
more
then
too
since
the
revolution
a
little
community
of
bourgeois
rich
shopkeepers
had
settled
upon
this
territory
which
once
belonged
to
the
contis
the
name
of
monsieur
de
varandeuil
sounded
very
grand
in
the
ears
of
all
those
good
people
they
bowed
very
low
to
him
they
contended
for
the
honor
of
entertaining
him
they
listened
respectfully
almost
devoutly
to
the
stories
he
told
of
society
as
it
was
and
thus
flattered
caressed
honored
as
a
relic
of
versailles
he
had
the
place
of
honor
and
the
prestige
of
a
lord
among
them
when
he
dined
with
madame
mutel
a
former
baker
who
had
forty
thousand
francs
a
year
the
hostess
left
the
table
silk
dress
and
all
to
go
and
fry
the
oyster
plants
herself
monsieur
de
varandeuil
did
not
like
them
except
as
she
cooked
them
but
monsieur
de
varandeuil
decision
to
go
into
retirement
at
was
mainly
due
not
to
the
pleasant
surroundings
there
but
to
a
project
that
he
had
formed
he
had
gone
thither
to
obtain
leisure
for
a
monumental
work
that
which
he
had
been
unable
to
do
for
the
honor
and
glory
of
italian
art
by
his
collection
he
proposed
to
do
by
his
pen
he
had
learned
a
little
italian
with
his
wife
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
present
vasari
of
the
to
the
french
public
to
translate
it
with
the
assistance
of
his
daughter
who
when
she
was
very
small
had
heard
her
mother
maid
speak
italian
and
had
retained
a
few
words
he
plunged
the
girl
into
vasari
he
locked
up
her
time
and
her
thoughts
in
grammars
dictionaries
commentaries
all
the
works
of
all
the
scholiasts
of
italian
art
kept
her
bending
double
over
the
ungrateful
toil
the
and
labor
of
translating
italian
words
groping
in
the
darkness
of
her
imperfect
knowledge
the
whole
burden
of
the
book
fell
upon
her
when
he
had
laid
out
her
task
he
would
leave
her
with
the
volumes
bound
in
white
vellum
to
go
and
ramble
about
the
neighborhood
paying
visits
gambling
at
some
château
or
dining
among
the
bourgeois
of
his
acquaintance
to
whom
he
would
complain
pathetically
of
the
laborious
effort
that
the
vast
undertaking
of
his
translation
entailed
upon
him
he
would
return
home
listen
to
the
reading
of
the
translation
made
during
the
day
make
comments
and
critical
remarks
and
upset
a
sentence
to
give
it
a
different
meaning
which
his
daughter
would
eliminate
again
when
he
had
gone
then
he
would
resume
his
walks
and
jaunts
like
a
man
who
has
well
earned
his
leisure
walking
very
erect
with
his
hat
under
his
arm
and
dainty
pumps
on
his
feet
enjoying
himself
the
sky
and
the
trees
and
rousseau
god
gentle
to
all
nature
and
loving
to
the
plants
from
time
to
time
fits
of
impatience
common
to
children
and
old
men
would
overtake
him
he
would
demand
a
certain
number
of
pages
for
the
next
day
and
would
compel
his
daughter
to
sit
up
half
the
night
two
or
three
years
passed
in
this
labor
in
which
sempronie
eyes
were
ruined
at
last
she
lived
entombed
in
her
father
vasari
more
entirely
alone
than
ever
holding
aloof
through
innate
haughty
repugnance
from
the
bourgeois
ladies
of
and
their
manners
la
madame
and
too
poorly
clad
to
visit
at
the
châteaux
for
her
there
was
no
pleasure
no
diversion
which
was
not
made
wretched
and
poisoned
by
her
father
eccentricities
and
fretful
humor
he
tore
up
the
flowers
that
she
planted
secretly
in
the
garden
he
would
have
nothing
there
but
vegetables
and
he
cultivated
them
himself
putting
forth
grand
utilitarian
theories
arguments
which
might
have
induced
the
convention
to
convert
the
tuileries
into
a
potato
field
her
only
enjoyment
was
when
her
father
at
very
long
intervals
allowed
her
to
entertain
one
of
her
two
young
friends
for
a
week
a
week
which
would
have
been
seven
days
of
paradise
to
sempronie
had
not
her
father
embittered
its
joys
its
diversions
its
fêtes
with
his
always
threatening
outbreaks
his
always
armed
and
alert
and
his
constant
about
trifles
a
bottle
of
eau
de
cologne
that
sempronie
asked
for
to
place
in
her
friend
room
a
dish
for
her
dinner
or
a
place
to
which
she
wished
to
take
her
at
monsieur
de
varandeuil
had
hired
a
servant
who
almost
immediately
became
his
mistress
a
child
was
born
of
this
connection
and
the
father
in
his
cynical
indifference
was
shameless
enough
to
have
it
brought
up
under
his
daughter
eyes
as
the
years
rolled
on
the
woman
acquired
a
firm
foothold
in
the
house
she
ended
by
ruling
the
household
father
and
daughter
alike
the
day
came
when
monsieur
de
varandeuil
chose
to
have
her
sit
at
his
table
and
be
served
by
sempronie
that
was
too
much
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
rebelled
under
the
insult
and
drew
herself
up
to
the
full
height
of
her
indignation
secretly
silently
in
misery
and
isolation
harshly
treated
by
the
people
and
the
things
about
her
the
girl
had
built
up
a
resolute
straightforward
character
tears
had
tempered
instead
of
softening
it
beneath
filial
docility
and
humility
beneath
passive
obedience
beneath
apparent
gentleness
of
disposition
she
concealed
a
character
of
iron
a
man
strength
of
will
one
of
those
hearts
which
nothing
bends
and
which
never
bend
themselves
when
her
father
demanded
that
she
lower
herself
to
that
extent
she
reminded
him
that
she
was
his
daughter
she
reviewed
her
whole
life
cast
in
a
flood
of
words
the
shame
and
the
reproach
of
it
in
his
face
and
concluded
by
informing
him
that
if
that
woman
did
not
leave
the
house
that
very
evening
she
would
leave
it
and
that
she
should
have
no
difficulty
in
living
thank
god
wherever
she
might
go
with
the
simple
tastes
he
had
forced
upon
her
the
father
thunderstruck
and
bewildered
by
this
revolt
yielded
and
dismissed
the
servant
but
he
retained
a
dastardly
sort
of
rancor
against
his
daughter
on
account
of
the
sacrifice
she
had
extorted
from
him
his
spleen
betrayed
itself
in
sharp
aggressive
words
ironical
thanks
and
bitter
smiles
sempronie
only
revenge
was
to
attend
to
his
wants
more
thoroughly
more
gently
more
patiently
than
ever
her
devotion
was
destined
to
be
subjected
to
one
final
test
the
old
man
had
a
stroke
of
apoplexy
which
left
him
with
one
whole
side
of
his
body
stiff
and
dead
lame
in
one
leg
and
asleep
so
far
as
his
intelligence
was
concerned
although
keenly
conscious
of
his
misfortune
and
of
his
dependence
upon
his
daughter
thereupon
all
the
evil
that
lay
dormant
in
the
depths
of
his
nature
was
aroused
and
let
loose
his
selfishness
amounted
to
ferocity
under
the
torment
of
his
suffering
and
his
weakness
he
became
a
sort
of
malevolent
madman
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
devoted
her
days
and
her
nights
to
the
invalid
who
seemed
to
hate
her
for
her
attentions
to
be
humiliated
by
her
care
as
if
it
implied
generosity
and
forgiveness
to
suffer
torments
at
seeing
always
by
his
side
indefatigable
and
kindly
that
image
of
duty
but
what
a
life
it
was
she
had
to
contend
against
the
miserable
man
incurable
to
be
always
ready
to
bear
him
company
to
lead
him
about
and
support
him
all
day
long
she
must
play
cards
with
him
when
he
was
at
home
and
not
let
him
win
or
lose
too
much
she
must
combat
his
wishes
his
gormandizing
tendencies
take
dishes
away
from
him
and
in
connection
with
everything
that
he
wanted
endure
complaints
reproaches
insults
tears
mad
despair
and
the
outbursts
of
childish
anger
in
which
helpless
old
men
indulge
and
this
lasted
ten
years
ten
years
during
which
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
had
no
other
recreation
no
other
consolation
than
to
pour
out
all
the
tenderness
and
warmth
of
a
maternal
affection
upon
one
of
her
two
young
friends
recently
married
her
as
she
called
her
it
was
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
delight
to
go
and
pass
a
short
time
every
fortnight
in
that
happy
household
she
would
kiss
the
pretty
child
already
in
its
cradle
and
asleep
for
the
night
when
she
arrived
she
would
dine
at
racing
speed
at
dessert
she
would
send
for
a
carriage
and
would
hasten
away
like
a
tardy
schoolboy
but
in
the
last
years
of
her
father
life
she
could
not
even
obtain
permission
to
dine
out
the
old
man
would
no
longer
sanction
such
a
long
absence
and
kept
her
almost
constantly
beside
him
repeating
again
and
again
that
he
was
well
aware
that
it
was
not
amusing
to
take
care
of
an
infirm
old
man
like
himself
but
that
she
would
soon
be
rid
of
him
he
died
in
and
before
his
death
could
find
no
words
but
these
for
her
who
had
been
his
daughter
nearly
forty
years
i
know
that
you
never
loved
me
two
years
before
her
father
death
sempronie
brother
had
returned
from
america
he
brought
with
him
a
colored
woman
who
had
nursed
him
through
the
yellow
fever
and
two
girls
already
grown
up
whom
he
had
had
by
the
woman
before
marrying
her
although
she
was
imbued
with
the
ideas
of
the
old
régime
as
to
the
blacks
and
although
she
looked
upon
that
ignorant
creature
with
her
negro
jargon
her
grin
like
a
wild
beast
and
her
skin
that
left
grease
stains
upon
her
clothing
as
no
better
than
a
monkey
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
combated
her
horror
and
unwillingness
to
receive
his
and
she
it
was
who
induced
him
in
the
last
days
of
his
life
to
allow
her
brother
to
present
his
wife
to
him
when
her
father
was
dead
she
reflected
that
her
brother
household
was
all
that
remained
of
the
family
monsieur
de
varandeuil
to
whom
the
comte
had
caused
the
arrears
of
salary
of
his
office
to
be
paid
at
the
return
of
the
bourbons
left
about
ten
thousand
francs
a
year
to
his
children
the
brother
had
before
that
inheritance
only
a
pension
of
fifteen
hundred
francs
from
the
united
states
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
considered
that
five
or
six
thousand
francs
a
year
would
hardly
suffice
for
the
comfortable
support
of
that
family
in
which
there
were
two
children
and
it
at
once
occurred
to
her
to
add
to
it
her
share
in
the
inheritance
she
suggested
this
contribution
in
the
most
natural
and
simple
way
imaginable
her
brother
accepted
it
and
she
went
with
him
to
live
in
a
pretty
little
apartment
at
the
upper
end
of
rue
de
clichy
on
the
fourth
floor
of
one
of
the
first
houses
built
in
that
neighborhood
then
hardly
known
where
the
fresh
country
air
blew
briskly
through
the
framework
of
the
white
buildings
she
continued
there
her
modest
life
her
humble
manner
of
dressing
her
economical
habits
content
with
the
least
desirable
room
in
the
suite
and
spending
upon
herself
no
more
than
eighteen
hundred
to
two
thousand
francs
a
year
but
soon
a
brooding
jealousy
slowly
gathering
strength
took
possession
of
the
mulattress
she
took
offence
at
the
fraternal
affection
which
seemed
to
be
taking
her
husband
from
her
arms
she
suffered
because
of
the
communion
of
speech
and
thought
and
reminiscences
between
them
she
suffered
because
of
the
conversations
in
which
she
could
take
no
part
because
of
what
she
heard
in
their
voices
but
could
not
understand
the
consciousness
of
her
inferiority
kindled
in
her
heart
the
fires
of
wrath
and
hatred
that
burn
fiercely
in
the
tropics
she
had
recourse
to
her
children
for
her
revenge
she
urged
them
on
excited
them
aroused
their
evil
passions
against
her
she
encouraged
them
to
laugh
at
her
to
make
sport
of
her
she
applauded
the
manifestations
of
the
mischievous
intelligence
characteristic
of
children
in
whom
observation
begins
with
naughtiness
once
she
had
let
them
loose
upon
their
aunt
she
allowed
them
to
laugh
at
all
her
absurdities
her
figure
her
nose
her
dresses
whose
meanness
nevertheless
provided
their
own
elegant
attire
thus
incited
and
upheld
the
little
ones
soon
arrived
at
insolence
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
had
the
quick
temper
that
accompanies
kindness
of
heart
with
her
the
hand
as
well
as
the
heart
had
a
part
in
the
first
impulse
and
then
she
shared
the
prevalent
opinion
of
her
time
as
to
the
proper
way
of
bringing
up
children
she
endured
two
or
three
impertinent
sallies
without
a
word
but
at
the
fourth
she
seized
the
mocking
child
took
down
her
skirts
and
administered
to
her
notwithstanding
her
twelve
years
the
soundest
whipping
she
had
ever
received
the
mulattress
made
a
great
outcry
and
told
her
that
she
had
always
detested
her
children
and
that
she
wanted
to
kill
them
the
brother
interposed
between
the
two
women
and
succeeded
in
reconciling
them
after
a
fashion
but
new
scenes
took
place
when
the
little
ones
inflamed
against
the
woman
who
made
their
mother
weep
assailed
their
aunt
with
the
refined
tortures
of
misbehaved
children
mingled
with
the
fiendish
cruelty
of
little
savages
after
several
truces
it
became
necessary
to
part
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
decided
to
leave
her
brother
for
she
saw
how
unhappy
he
was
amid
this
daily
wrenching
of
his
dearest
affections
she
left
him
to
his
wife
and
his
children
this
separation
was
one
of
the
great
sorrows
of
her
life
she
who
was
so
strong
against
emotion
and
so
and
who
seemed
to
take
pride
in
suffering
as
it
were
almost
broke
down
when
she
had
to
leave
the
apartment
where
she
had
dreamed
of
enjoying
a
little
happiness
in
her
corner
looking
on
at
the
happiness
of
others
her
last
tears
mounted
to
her
eyes
she
did
not
go
too
far
away
so
that
she
might
be
at
hand
to
nurse
her
brother
if
he
were
ill
and
to
see
him
and
meet
him
sometimes
but
there
was
a
great
void
in
her
heart
and
in
her
life
she
had
begun
to
visit
her
kinsfolk
since
her
father
death
she
drew
nearer
to
them
she
allowed
the
relatives
whom
the
restoration
had
placed
in
a
lofty
and
powerful
position
to
come
to
her
and
sought
out
those
whom
the
new
order
of
things
left
in
obscurity
and
poverty
but
she
returned
to
her
dear
first
of
all
and
to
another
distant
cousin
also
married
who
had
become
the
her
relations
with
her
kinsfolk
soon
assumed
remarkable
regularity
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
never
went
into
society
to
an
evening
party
or
to
the
play
it
required
mademoiselle
rachel
brilliant
success
to
persuade
her
to
step
inside
a
theatre
she
ventured
there
but
twice
she
never
accepted
an
invitation
to
a
large
but
there
were
two
or
three
houses
where
as
at
the
she
would
invite
herself
to
dine
unexpectedly
when
there
were
no
guests
my
love
she
would
say
without
ceremony
are
you
and
your
husband
doing
nothing
this
evening
then
i
will
stay
and
eat
some
of
your
ragoût
at
eight
regularly
she
rose
to
go
and
when
the
husband
took
his
hat
to
escort
her
home
she
would
knock
it
out
of
his
hands
with
a
nonsense
an
old
like
me
why
i
frighten
men
in
the
street
and
then
ten
days
or
a
fortnight
would
pass
during
which
they
would
not
see
her
but
if
anything
went
wrong
if
there
was
a
death
or
sickness
in
the
house
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
always
heard
of
it
at
once
no
one
knew
how
she
would
come
in
spite
of
everything
the
weather
or
the
hour
would
give
a
loud
ring
at
the
bell
in
her
own
way
they
finally
called
it
and
a
moment
later
relieved
of
her
umbrella
which
never
left
her
and
of
her
pattens
her
hat
tossed
upon
a
chair
she
was
at
the
service
of
those
who
needed
her
she
listened
talked
restored
their
courage
with
an
indescribable
martial
accent
with
language
as
energetic
as
a
soldier
might
use
to
console
a
wounded
comrade
and
stimulating
as
a
cordial
if
it
was
a
child
that
was
out
of
sorts
she
would
go
straight
to
the
bed
laugh
at
the
little
one
whose
fear
vanished
at
once
order
the
father
and
mother
about
run
hither
and
thither
assume
the
management
of
everything
apply
the
leeches
arrange
the
cataplasms
and
bring
back
hope
joy
and
health
at
the
double
quick
in
all
branches
of
the
family
the
old
maid
appeared
thus
providentially
without
warning
on
days
of
sorrow
and
suffering
she
was
never
seen
except
when
her
hands
were
needed
to
heal
her
devoted
friendship
to
console
she
was
so
to
speak
an
impersonal
creature
because
of
her
great
heart
a
woman
who
did
not
belong
to
herself
god
seemed
to
have
made
her
only
to
give
her
to
others
her
everlasting
black
dress
which
she
persisted
in
wearing
her
worn
dyed
shawl
her
absurd
hat
her
impoverished
appearance
were
in
her
eyes
the
means
of
being
rich
enough
to
help
others
with
her
little
fortune
she
was
extravagant
in
almsgiving
and
her
pockets
were
always
filled
with
gifts
for
the
poor
not
of
money
for
she
feared
the
wineshop
but
of
loaves
which
she
bought
for
them
at
the
baker
and
then
too
by
dint
of
living
in
poverty
she
was
able
to
give
herself
what
was
to
her
the
greatest
of
all
luxuries
the
joy
of
her
friends
children
whom
she
overwhelmed
with
new
year
and
other
gifts
with
surprises
and
pleasures
of
all
sorts
for
instance
suppose
that
one
of
them
had
been
left
by
his
mother
who
was
absent
from
paris
to
pass
a
lovely
summer
sunday
at
his
boarding
school
and
the
little
rascal
out
of
spite
had
misbehaved
so
that
he
was
not
allowed
to
go
out
how
surprised
he
would
be
as
the
clock
struck
nine
to
see
his
old
cousin
appear
in
the
courtyard
just
buttoning
the
last
button
of
her
dress
she
had
come
in
such
haste
and
what
a
feeling
of
desolation
at
the
sight
cousin
he
would
say
piteously
in
one
of
those
fits
of
passion
in
which
at
the
same
moment
you
long
to
cry
and
to
kill
your
i
i
am
kept
in
and
kept
in
oh
yes
kept
in
and
do
you
suppose
i
taken
all
this
trouble
is
your
schoolmaster
poking
fun
at
me
where
is
the
puppy
that
i
may
have
a
word
with
him
you
go
and
dress
yourself
meanwhile
off
with
you
and
the
child
not
daring
to
hope
that
a
woman
so
shabbily
dressed
would
have
the
power
to
raise
the
embargo
would
suddenly
feel
a
hand
upon
his
arm
and
the
cousin
would
carry
him
off
toss
him
into
a
cab
all
bewildered
and
dumfounded
with
joy
and
take
him
to
the
bois
de
boulogne
she
would
let
him
ride
a
donkey
all
day
long
urging
the
beast
on
with
a
broken
branch
and
crying
get
up
and
then
after
a
good
dinner
at
borne
she
would
take
him
back
to
school
and
under
the
as
she
kissed
him
she
would
slip
a
big
piece
into
his
hand
strange
old
maid
the
bitter
experiences
of
her
whole
existence
the
struggle
to
live
the
physical
suffering
the
bodily
and
mental
torture
had
as
it
were
cut
her
loose
from
life
and
placed
her
above
it
her
education
the
things
she
had
seen
the
spectacle
of
what
seemed
the
end
of
everything
the
revolution
had
so
formed
her
character
as
to
lead
her
to
disdain
human
suffering
and
this
old
woman
who
had
nothing
left
of
life
save
breath
had
risen
to
a
serene
philosophy
to
a
virile
haughty
almost
satirical
stoicism
sometimes
she
would
begin
to
declaim
against
a
sorrow
that
seemed
a
little
too
keen
but
in
the
midst
of
her
tirade
she
would
suddenly
hurl
an
angry
mocking
word
at
herself
upon
which
her
face
would
at
once
become
calm
she
was
cheerful
with
the
cheerfulness
of
a
deep
bubbling
spring
the
cheerfulness
of
devoted
hearts
that
have
seen
everything
of
the
old
soldier
or
the
old
hospital
nurse
to
admiration
she
was
and
yet
something
was
lacking
in
her
kindness
of
heart
forgiveness
hitherto
she
had
never
succeeded
in
moving
or
bending
her
character
a
slight
an
unkind
action
a
trifle
if
it
touched
her
heart
wounded
her
forever
she
forgot
nothing
time
death
itself
did
not
disarm
her
memory
of
religion
she
had
none
born
at
a
period
when
women
did
without
it
she
had
grown
to
womanhood
at
a
time
when
there
were
no
churches
mass
did
not
exist
when
she
was
a
young
maid
there
had
been
nothing
to
accustom
her
to
the
thought
of
god
or
to
make
her
feel
the
need
of
him
and
she
had
retained
a
sort
of
shrinking
hatred
for
priests
which
must
have
been
connected
with
some
family
secret
of
which
she
never
spoke
her
faith
her
strength
her
piety
all
consisted
in
the
pride
of
her
conscience
she
considered
that
if
she
retained
her
own
esteem
she
could
be
sure
of
acting
rightly
and
of
never
failing
in
her
duty
she
was
thus
singularly
constituted
by
the
two
epochs
in
which
she
had
lived
a
compound
of
the
two
dipped
in
the
opposing
currents
of
the
old
régime
and
the
revolution
after
louis
xvi
failed
to
take
horse
on
the
tenth
of
august
she
lost
her
regard
for
kings
but
she
detested
the
mob
she
desired
equality
and
she
held
parvenus
in
horror
she
was
a
republican
and
an
aristocrat
combined
scepticism
with
prejudice
the
horrors
of
which
she
saw
with
the
vague
and
noble
theories
of
humanity
which
surrounded
her
cradle
her
external
qualities
were
altogether
masculine
she
had
the
sharp
voice
the
freedom
of
speech
the
unruly
tongue
of
the
old
woman
of
the
eighteenth
century
heightened
by
an
accent
suggestive
of
the
common
people
a
mannish
highly
colored
style
of
elocution
peculiar
to
herself
rising
above
modesty
in
the
choice
of
words
and
fearless
in
calling
things
baldly
by
their
plain
names
meanwhile
the
years
rolled
on
sweeping
away
the
restoration
and
the
monarchy
of
she
saw
all
those
whom
she
had
loved
go
from
her
one
by
one
all
her
family
take
the
road
to
the
cemetery
she
was
left
quite
alone
and
she
marveled
and
was
grieved
that
death
should
forget
her
who
would
have
offered
so
little
resistance
for
she
was
already
leaning
over
the
grave
and
was
obliged
to
force
her
heart
down
to
the
level
of
the
little
children
brought
to
her
by
the
sons
and
daughters
of
the
friends
whom
she
had
lost
her
brother
was
dead
her
dear
was
no
more
the
alone
was
left
to
her
but
hers
was
a
life
that
hung
trembling
in
the
balance
ready
to
fly
away
crushed
by
the
death
of
a
child
for
whom
she
had
waited
for
years
the
poor
woman
was
dying
of
consumption
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
was
in
her
bedroom
every
day
from
noon
until
six
for
four
years
she
lived
by
her
side
all
that
time
in
the
close
atmosphere
and
the
odor
of
constant
fumigations
she
did
not
allow
herself
to
be
kept
away
for
one
hour
by
her
own
gout
and
rheumatism
but
gave
her
time
and
her
life
to
the
peaceful
last
hours
of
that
dying
woman
whose
eyes
were
fixed
upon
heaven
where
her
dead
children
awaited
her
and
when
in
the
cemetery
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
had
turned
aside
the
shroud
to
kiss
the
dead
face
for
the
last
time
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
there
were
no
one
near
to
her
as
if
she
were
all
alone
upon
the
earth
thenceforth
yielding
to
the
infirmities
which
she
had
no
further
reason
to
shake
off
she
began
to
live
the
narrow
confined
life
of
old
people
who
wear
out
their
carpet
in
one
spot
only
never
leaving
her
room
reading
but
little
because
it
tired
her
eyes
and
passing
most
of
her
time
buried
in
her
reviewing
the
past
and
living
it
over
again
she
would
sit
in
the
same
position
for
days
her
eyes
wide
open
and
dreaming
her
thoughts
far
from
herself
far
from
the
room
in
which
she
sat
journeying
whither
her
memories
led
her
to
distant
faces
dearly
loved
pallid
faces
to
vanished
regions
lost
in
a
profound
lethargy
which
germinie
was
careful
not
to
disturb
saying
to
herself
madame
is
in
her
meditations
one
day
in
every
week
however
she
went
abroad
indeed
it
was
with
that
weekly
excursion
in
view
in
order
to
be
nearer
the
spot
to
which
she
wished
to
go
on
that
one
day
that
she
left
her
apartments
on
rue
taitbout
and
took
up
her
abode
on
rue
de
laval
one
day
in
every
week
deterred
by
nothing
not
even
by
illness
she
repaired
to
the
montmartre
cemetery
where
her
father
and
her
brother
rested
and
the
women
whose
loss
she
regretted
all
those
whose
sufferings
had
come
to
an
end
before
hers
for
the
dead
and
for
death
she
displayed
a
veneration
almost
equal
to
that
of
the
ancients
to
her
the
grave
was
sacred
and
a
dear
friend
she
loved
to
visit
the
land
of
hope
and
deliverance
where
her
dear
ones
were
sleeping
there
to
await
death
and
to
be
ready
with
her
body
on
that
day
she
would
start
early
in
the
morning
leaning
on
the
arm
of
her
maid
who
carried
a
as
she
drew
near
the
cemetery
she
would
enter
the
shop
of
a
dealer
in
wreaths
who
had
known
her
for
many
years
and
who
in
winter
loaned
her
a
there
she
would
rest
a
few
moments
then
loading
germinie
down
with
wreaths
of
immortelles
she
would
pass
through
the
cemetery
gate
take
the
path
to
the
left
of
the
cedar
at
the
entrance
and
make
her
pilgrimage
slowly
from
tomb
to
tomb
she
would
throw
away
the
withered
flowers
sweep
up
the
dead
leaves
tie
the
wreaths
together
and
sitting
down
upon
her
would
gaze
and
dream
and
remove
a
bit
of
moss
from
the
flat
stone
with
the
end
of
her
umbrella
then
she
would
rise
turn
as
if
to
say
to
the
tomb
she
was
leaving
walk
away
stop
once
more
and
talk
in
an
undertone
as
she
had
done
before
with
that
part
of
her
that
was
sleeping
under
the
stone
and
having
thus
paid
a
visit
to
all
the
dead
who
lived
in
her
affections
she
would
return
home
slowly
and
reverentially
enveloping
herself
in
silence
as
if
she
were
afraid
to
speak
iii
in
the
course
of
her
reverie
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
had
closed
her
eyes
the
maid
story
ceased
and
the
remainder
of
the
history
of
her
life
which
was
upon
her
lips
that
evening
was
once
more
buried
in
her
heart
the
conclusion
of
her
story
was
as
follows
when
little
germinie
lacerteux
arrived
in
paris
being
then
less
than
fifteen
years
old
her
sister
desirous
to
have
her
begin
to
earn
her
living
at
once
and
to
help
to
put
bread
in
her
hand
obtained
a
place
for
her
in
a
small
café
on
the
boulevard
where
she
performed
the
double
duties
of
lady
maid
to
the
mistress
of
the
café
and
assistant
to
the
waiters
in
carrying
on
the
main
business
of
the
establishment
the
child
just
from
her
village
and
dropped
suddenly
in
that
place
was
completely
bewildered
and
terrified
by
her
surroundings
and
her
duties
she
had
the
first
instinctive
feeling
of
wounded
modesty
and
foreshadowing
the
woman
she
was
destined
to
become
she
shuddered
at
the
perpetual
contact
with
the
other
sex
working
eating
passing
her
whole
time
with
men
and
whenever
she
had
an
opportunity
to
go
out
and
went
to
her
sisters
there
were
tearful
despairing
scenes
when
without
actually
complaining
of
anything
she
manifested
a
sort
of
dread
to
return
saying
that
she
did
not
want
to
stay
there
that
they
were
not
satisfied
with
her
that
she
preferred
to
return
to
them
they
would
reply
that
it
had
already
cost
them
enough
to
bring
her
to
paris
that
it
was
a
silly
whim
on
her
part
and
that
she
was
very
well
off
where
she
was
and
they
would
send
her
back
to
the
café
in
tears
she
dared
not
tell
all
that
she
suffered
in
the
company
of
the
waiters
in
the
café
insolent
boasting
cynical
fellows
fed
on
the
remains
of
debauches
tainted
with
all
the
vices
to
which
they
ministered
and
corrupt
to
the
core
with
putrefying
odds
and
ends
of
obscenity
at
every
turn
she
had
to
submit
to
the
dastardly
jests
the
cruel
mystifications
the
malicious
tricks
of
these
scoundrels
who
were
only
too
happy
to
make
a
little
martyr
of
the
poor
unsophisticated
child
ignorant
of
everything
with
the
crushed
and
sickly
air
timid
and
sullen
thin
and
pale
and
pitiably
clad
in
her
wretched
countrified
gowns
bewildered
overwhelmed
so
to
speak
by
this
hourly
torture
she
became
their
drudge
they
made
sport
of
her
ignorance
they
deceived
her
and
abused
her
credulity
by
absurd
fables
they
overburdened
her
with
fatiguing
tasks
they
assailed
her
with
incessant
pitiless
ridicule
which
drove
her
benumbed
intellect
to
imbecility
in
addition
they
made
her
blush
at
the
things
they
said
to
her
which
made
her
feel
ashamed
although
she
did
not
understand
them
they
soiled
the
artlessness
of
her
fourteen
years
with
filthy
veiled
allusions
and
they
found
amusement
in
putting
the
eyes
of
her
childish
curiosity
to
the
keyholes
of
the
private
the
little
one
longed
to
confide
in
her
sisters
but
she
dared
not
when
with
nourishing
food
her
body
took
on
a
little
flesh
her
cheeks
a
little
color
and
she
began
to
have
something
of
the
aspect
of
a
woman
they
took
great
liberties
with
her
and
grew
bolder
there
were
attempts
at
familiarity
significant
gestures
advances
which
she
eluded
and
from
which
she
escaped
unscathed
but
which
assailed
her
purity
by
breathing
upon
her
innocence
roughly
treated
scolded
reviled
by
the
master
of
the
establishment
who
was
accustomed
to
abuse
his
maidservants
and
who
bore
her
a
grudge
because
she
was
not
old
enough
or
of
the
right
sort
for
a
mistress
she
found
no
support
no
touch
of
humanity
except
in
his
wife
she
began
to
love
that
woman
with
a
sort
of
animal
devotion
and
to
obey
her
with
the
docility
of
a
dog
she
did
all
her
errands
without
thought
or
reflection
she
carried
her
letters
to
her
lovers
and
was
very
clever
about
delivering
them
she
became
very
active
and
agile
and
ingenuously
sly
in
passing
in
and
out
evading
the
awakened
suspicions
of
the
husband
and
without
any
clear
idea
of
what
she
was
doing
or
of
what
she
was
concealing
she
felt
a
mischievous
delight
such
as
children
and
monkeys
feel
in
telling
herself
vaguely
that
she
was
causing
some
little
suffering
to
that
man
and
that
house
which
caused
her
so
much
there
was
among
her
comrades
an
old
waiter
named
joseph
who
defended
her
warned
her
of
the
cruel
plots
concocted
against
her
and
when
she
was
present
put
a
stop
to
conversation
that
was
too
free
with
the
authority
of
his
white
hairs
and
his
paternal
interest
in
the
girl
meanwhile
germinie
horror
of
the
house
increased
every
day
one
week
her
sisters
were
compelled
to
take
her
back
to
the
café
by
force
a
few
days
later
there
was
a
great
review
on
the
champ
de
mars
and
the
waiters
had
leave
of
absence
for
the
day
only
germinie
and
old
joseph
remained
in
the
house
joseph
was
at
work
sorting
soiled
linen
in
a
small
dark
room
he
told
germinie
to
come
and
help
him
she
entered
the
room
she
cried
out
fell
to
the
floor
wept
implored
struggled
called
desperately
for
help
the
empty
house
was
deaf
when
she
recovered
consciousness
germinie
ran
and
shut
herself
up
in
her
chamber
she
was
not
seen
again
that
day
on
the
following
day
when
joseph
walked
toward
her
and
attempted
to
speak
to
her
she
recoiled
from
him
in
dismay
with
the
gesture
of
a
woman
mad
with
fear
for
a
long
time
whenever
a
man
approached
her
her
first
involuntary
impulse
was
to
draw
back
suddenly
trembling
and
nervous
like
a
terrified
bewildered
beast
looking
about
for
means
of
flight
joseph
who
feared
that
she
would
denounce
him
allowed
her
to
keep
him
at
a
distance
and
respected
the
horrible
repugnance
she
exhibited
for
him
she
became
one
sunday
she
had
been
to
pass
the
evening
with
her
sister
the
concierge
she
had
an
attack
of
vomiting
followed
by
severe
pain
a
physician
who
occupied
an
apartment
in
the
house
came
to
the
lodge
for
his
key
and
the
sisters
learned
from
him
the
secret
of
their
younger
sister
condition
the
brutal
intractable
pride
of
the
common
people
in
their
honor
the
implacable
severity
of
rigid
piety
flew
to
arms
in
the
two
women
and
found
vent
in
fierce
indignation
their
bewilderment
changed
to
fury
germinie
recovered
consciousness
under
their
blows
their
insults
the
wounds
inflicted
by
their
hands
the
harsh
words
that
came
from
their
mouths
her
was
there
who
had
never
forgiven
her
the
cost
of
her
journey
he
glanced
at
her
with
a
bantering
expression
with
the
cunning
ferocious
joy
of
an
auvergnat
with
a
sneering
laugh
that
dyed
the
girl
cheeks
a
deeper
red
than
her
sisters
blows
she
received
the
blows
she
did
not
repel
the
insults
she
sought
neither
to
defend
nor
to
excuse
herself
she
did
not
tell
what
had
taken
place
and
how
little
her
own
desires
had
had
to
do
with
her
misfortune
she
was
dumb
she
had
a
vague
hope
that
they
would
kill
her
when
her
older
sister
asked
her
if
there
had
been
no
violence
and
reminded
her
that
there
were
police
officers
and
courts
she
closed
her
eyes
at
the
thought
of
publishing
her
shame
for
one
instant
only
when
her
mother
memory
was
cast
in
her
face
she
emitted
a
glance
a
lightning
flash
from
her
eyes
by
which
the
two
women
felt
their
consciences
pierced
they
remembered
that
they
were
the
ones
who
had
placed
her
and
kept
her
in
that
den
and
had
exposed
her
to
the
danger
nay
had
almost
forced
her
into
her
misfortune
that
same
evening
the
younger
of
germinie
sisters
took
her
to
the
rue
to
the
house
of
a
repairer
of
cashmere
shawls
with
whom
she
lodged
and
who
being
almost
daft
on
the
subject
of
religion
was
in
a
sisterhood
of
the
virgin
she
made
her
lie
beside
her
on
a
mattress
on
the
floor
and
having
her
there
under
her
hand
all
night
she
vented
upon
her
all
her
venomous
jealousy
her
bitter
resentment
at
the
preference
the
caresses
given
germinie
by
her
father
and
mother
it
was
a
long
succession
of
petty
tortures
brutal
or
hypocritical
exhibitions
of
spite
kicks
that
bruised
her
legs
and
progressive
movements
of
the
body
by
which
she
gradually
forced
her
companion
out
of
bed
it
was
a
cold
winter
night
to
the
floor
of
the
fireless
room
during
the
day
the
seamstress
took
germinie
in
hand
catechized
her
preached
at
her
and
by
detailing
the
tortures
of
the
other
life
inspired
in
her
mind
a
horrible
fear
of
the
hell
whose
flames
she
caused
her
to
feel
she
lived
there
four
months
in
close
confinement
and
was
never
allowed
to
leave
the
house
at
the
end
of
four
months
she
gave
birth
to
a
dead
child
when
her
health
was
restored
she
entered
the
service
of
a
depilator
on
rue
laffitte
and
for
the
first
few
days
she
had
the
joyful
feeling
of
having
been
released
from
prison
two
or
three
times
in
her
walks
she
met
old
joseph
who
ran
after
her
and
wanted
to
marry
her
but
she
escaped
him
and
the
old
man
never
knew
that
he
had
been
a
father
but
soon
germinie
began
to
pine
away
in
her
new
place
the
house
where
she
had
taken
service
as
a
maid
of
all
work
was
what
servants
call
a
barrack
a
spendthrift
and
glutton
devoid
of
order
as
of
money
as
is
often
the
case
with
women
engaged
in
the
occupations
that
depend
upon
chance
and
in
the
problematical
methods
of
gaining
a
livelihood
in
vogue
in
paris
the
depilator
who
was
almost
always
involved
in
a
lawsuit
of
some
sort
paid
but
little
heed
to
her
small
nourishment
she
often
went
away
for
the
whole
day
without
leaving
her
any
dinner
the
little
one
would
satisfy
her
appetite
as
well
as
she
could
with
some
kind
of
uncooked
food
salads
vinegary
things
that
deceive
a
young
woman
appetite
even
charcoal
which
she
would
nibble
with
the
depraved
taste
and
capricious
stomach
of
her
age
and
sex
this
diet
just
after
recovering
from
her
confinement
her
health
being
but
partially
restored
and
greatly
in
need
of
stimulants
exhausted
the
young
woman
strength
reduced
her
flesh
and
undermined
her
constitution
she
had
a
terrifying
aspect
her
complexion
changed
to
that
dead
white
that
looks
green
in
the
daylight
her
swollen
eyes
were
surrounded
with
a
great
bluish
shadow
her
discolored
lips
assumed
the
hue
of
faded
violets
her
breath
failed
her
at
the
slightest
ascent
and
the
incessant
vibrating
sound
that
came
from
the
arteries
of
her
throat
was
painful
to
those
near
her
with
heavy
feet
and
enfeebled
body
she
dragged
herself
along
as
if
life
were
too
heavy
a
burden
for
her
her
faculties
and
her
senses
were
so
torpid
that
she
swooned
for
no
cause
at
all
for
so
small
a
matter
as
the
fatigue
of
combing
her
hair
she
was
silently
drooping
there
when
her
sister
found
her
another
place
with
a
former
actor
a
retired
comedian
living
upon
the
money
that
the
laughter
of
all
paris
had
brought
him
the
good
man
was
old
and
had
never
had
any
children
he
took
pity
on
the
wretched
girl
interested
himself
in
her
welfare
took
care
of
her
and
made
much
of
her
he
took
her
into
the
country
he
walked
with
her
on
the
boulevards
in
the
sunlight
and
enjoyed
the
warmth
the
more
for
leaning
on
her
arm
it
delighted
him
to
see
her
in
good
spirits
often
to
amuse
her
he
would
take
down
a
costume
from
his
wardrobe
and
try
to
remember
a
fragment
of
some
part
that
had
gone
from
his
memory
the
mere
sight
of
this
little
maid
and
her
white
cap
was
like
a
ray
of
returning
youth
to
him
in
his
old
age
jocrisse
leaned
upon
her
with
the
the
pleasures
and
the
childish
fancies
of
a
grandfather
heart
but
he
died
after
a
few
months
and
germinie
had
fallen
back
into
the
service
of
kept
mistresses
keepers
and
passageway
tradesmen
when
the
sudden
death
of
a
maidservant
gave
her
an
opportunity
to
enter
the
service
of
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
then
living
on
rue
taitbout
in
the
house
of
which
her
sister
was
concierge
iv
those
people
who
look
for
the
death
of
the
catholic
religion
in
our
day
do
not
realize
by
what
an
infinite
number
of
sturdy
roots
it
still
retains
its
hold
upon
the
hearts
of
the
people
they
do
not
realize
the
secret
delicate
fascination
it
has
for
the
woman
of
the
people
they
do
not
realize
what
confession
and
the
confessor
are
to
the
impoverished
souls
of
those
poor
women
in
the
priest
who
listens
and
whose
voice
falls
softly
on
her
ear
the
woman
of
toil
and
suffering
sees
not
so
much
the
minister
of
god
the
judge
of
her
sins
the
arbiter
of
her
welfare
as
the
confidant
of
her
sorrows
and
the
friend
of
her
misery
however
coarse
she
may
be
there
is
always
a
little
of
the
true
woman
in
her
a
feverish
trembling
sensitive
wounded
something
a
restlessness
and
as
it
were
the
sighing
of
an
invalid
who
craves
caressing
words
even
as
a
child
trifling
ailments
require
the
nurse
droning
lullaby
she
as
well
as
the
woman
of
the
world
must
have
the
consolation
of
pouring
out
her
heart
of
confiding
her
troubles
to
a
sympathetic
ear
for
it
is
the
nature
of
her
sex
to
seek
an
outlet
for
the
emotions
and
an
arm
to
lean
upon
there
are
in
her
mind
things
that
she
must
tell
and
concerning
which
she
would
like
to
be
questioned
pitied
and
comforted
she
dreams
of
a
compassionate
interest
a
tender
sympathy
for
hidden
feelings
of
which
she
is
ashamed
her
masters
may
be
the
kindest
the
most
friendly
the
most
approachable
of
masters
to
the
woman
in
their
employ
their
kindness
to
her
will
still
be
of
the
same
sort
that
they
bestow
upon
a
domestic
animal
they
will
be
uneasy
concerning
her
appetite
and
her
health
they
will
look
carefully
after
the
animal
part
of
her
and
that
will
be
all
it
will
not
occur
to
them
that
she
can
suffer
elsewhere
than
in
her
body
and
they
will
not
dream
that
she
can
have
the
heartache
the
sadness
and
immaterial
pain
for
which
they
seek
relief
by
confiding
in
those
of
their
own
station
in
their
eyes
the
woman
who
sweeps
and
does
the
cooking
has
no
ideas
that
can
cause
her
to
be
sad
or
thoughtful
and
they
never
speak
to
her
of
her
thoughts
to
whom
then
shall
she
carry
them
to
the
priest
who
is
waiting
for
them
asks
for
them
welcomes
them
to
the
churchman
who
is
also
a
man
of
the
world
a
superior
creature
a
gentleman
who
knows
everything
speaks
well
is
always
accessible
gentle
patient
attentive
and
seems
to
feel
no
scorn
for
the
most
humble
soul
the
most
shabbily
dressed
penitent
the
priest
alone
listens
to
the
woman
in
a
cap
he
alone
takes
an
interest
in
her
secret
sufferings
in
the
things
that
disturb
and
agitate
her
and
that
bring
to
a
maid
as
well
as
to
her
mistress
the
sudden
longing
to
weep
or
excite
a
tempest
within
her
there
is
none
but
he
to
encourage
her
outpourings
to
draw
from
her
those
things
which
the
irony
of
her
daily
life
holds
back
to
look
to
the
state
of
her
moral
health
none
but
he
to
raise
her
above
her
material
life
none
but
he
to
cheer
her
with
moving
words
of
charity
and
hope
such
divine
words
as
she
has
never
heard
from
the
mouths
of
the
men
of
her
family
and
of
her
class
after
entering
the
service
of
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
germinie
became
profoundly
religious
and
cared
for
nothing
but
the
church
she
abandoned
herself
little
by
little
to
the
sweet
delight
of
confession
to
the
priest
smooth
tranquil
bass
voice
that
came
to
her
from
the
darkness
to
the
conversations
which
resembled
the
touch
of
soothing
words
and
from
which
she
went
forth
refreshed
light
of
heart
free
from
care
and
happy
with
a
delightful
sense
of
relief
as
if
a
balm
had
been
applied
to
all
the
tender
suffering
fettered
portions
of
her
being
she
did
not
could
not
open
her
heart
elsewhere
her
mistress
had
a
certain
masculine
roughness
of
demeanor
which
repelled
expansiveness
she
had
an
abrupt
exclamatory
way
of
speaking
that
forced
back
all
that
germinie
would
have
liked
to
confide
to
her
it
was
in
her
nature
to
be
brutal
in
her
treatment
of
all
lamentations
that
were
not
caused
by
pain
or
disappointment
her
virile
kindliness
had
no
pity
to
spare
for
diseases
of
the
imagination
for
the
suffering
that
is
created
by
the
thought
for
the
weariness
of
spirit
that
flows
from
a
woman
nerves
and
from
the
disordered
condition
of
her
mental
organism
germinie
often
found
her
unfeeling
the
old
woman
had
simply
been
hardened
by
the
times
in
which
she
had
lived
and
by
the
circumstances
of
her
life
the
shell
of
her
heart
was
as
hard
as
her
body
never
complaining
herself
she
did
not
like
to
hear
complaints
about
her
and
by
the
right
of
all
the
tears
she
had
not
shed
she
detested
childish
tears
in
grown
persons
soon
the
confessional
became
a
sort
of
sacred
idolized
rendezvous
for
germinie
thoughts
every
day
it
was
her
first
idea
the
theme
of
her
first
prayer
throughout
the
day
she
was
kneeling
there
as
in
a
dream
and
while
she
was
about
her
work
it
was
constantly
before
her
eyes
with
its
oaken
frame
with
fillets
of
gold
its
pediment
in
the
shape
of
a
winged
angel
head
its
green
curtain
with
the
motionless
folds
and
the
mysterious
darkness
on
both
sides
it
seemed
to
her
that
now
her
whole
life
centred
there
and
that
every
hour
tended
thither
she
lived
through
the
week
looking
forward
to
that
promised
day
on
thursday
she
began
to
be
impatient
she
felt
in
the
redoubling
of
her
blissful
agony
the
material
drawing
near
as
it
were
of
the
blessed
saturday
evening
and
when
saturday
came
and
mademoiselle
dinner
had
been
hastily
served
and
her
work
done
she
would
make
her
escape
and
run
to
de
lorette
hurrying
to
the
penitential
stool
as
to
a
lover
rendezvous
her
fingers
dipped
in
holy
water
and
a
genuflexion
duly
made
she
would
glide
over
the
flags
between
the
rows
of
chairs
as
softly
as
a
cat
steals
across
a
carpeted
floor
with
bent
head
almost
crawling
she
would
go
noiselessly
forward
in
the
shadow
of
the
side
aisles
until
she
reached
the
mysterious
veiled
confessional
where
she
would
pause
and
await
her
turn
absorbed
in
the
emotion
of
suspense
the
young
priest
who
confessed
her
encouraged
her
frequent
confessions
he
was
not
sparing
of
time
or
attention
or
charity
he
allowed
her
to
talk
at
great
length
and
tell
him
with
many
words
of
all
her
petty
troubles
he
was
indulgent
to
the
diffuseness
of
a
suffering
soul
and
permitted
her
to
pour
out
freely
her
most
trivial
afflictions
he
listened
while
she
set
forth
her
anxieties
her
longings
her
troubles
he
did
not
repel
or
treat
with
scorn
any
portion
of
the
confidences
of
a
servant
who
spoke
to
him
of
all
the
most
delicate
secret
concerns
of
her
existence
as
one
would
speak
to
a
mother
and
a
physician
this
priest
was
young
he
was
he
had
lived
in
the
world
a
great
sorrow
had
impelled
him
crushed
and
broken
to
assume
the
gown
wherein
he
wore
mourning
for
his
heart
there
remained
something
of
the
man
in
the
depths
of
his
being
and
he
listened
with
melancholy
compassion
to
the
outpouring
of
this
maidservant
suffering
heart
he
understood
that
germinie
needed
him
that
he
sustained
and
strengthened
her
that
he
saved
her
from
herself
and
removed
her
from
the
temptations
to
which
her
nature
exposed
her
he
was
conscious
of
a
sad
sympathy
for
that
heart
overflowing
with
affection
for
the
ardent
yet
tractable
girl
for
the
unhappy
creature
who
knew
nothing
of
her
own
nature
who
was
promised
to
passion
by
every
impulse
of
her
heart
by
her
whole
body
and
who
betrayed
in
every
detail
of
her
person
the
vocation
of
her
temperament
enlightened
by
his
past
experience
he
was
amazed
and
terrified
sometimes
by
the
gleams
that
emanated
from
her
by
the
flame
that
shot
from
her
eyes
at
the
outburst
of
love
in
a
prayer
by
the
evident
tendency
of
her
confessions
by
her
constantly
recurring
to
that
scene
of
violence
that
scene
in
which
her
perfectly
sincere
purpose
to
resist
seemed
to
the
priest
to
have
been
betrayed
by
a
convulsion
of
the
senses
that
was
stronger
than
she
this
fever
of
religion
lasted
several
years
during
which
germinie
lived
a
concentrated
silent
happy
life
entirely
devoted
to
service
at
least
she
thought
so
her
confessor
however
had
come
gradually
to
the
conclusion
that
all
her
adoration
tended
toward
himself
by
her
glances
by
her
blushes
by
the
words
she
no
longer
said
to
him
and
by
others
which
she
made
bold
to
say
to
him
for
the
first
time
he
realized
that
his
penitent
devotion
was
going
astray
and
becoming
unduly
fervent
deceiving
itself
as
to
its
object
she
watched
for
him
when
the
services
were
at
an
end
followed
him
into
the
sacristy
hung
on
his
skirts
ran
into
the
church
after
his
cassock
the
confessor
tried
to
warn
her
to
divert
her
amorous
fervor
from
himself
he
became
more
reserved
and
assumed
a
cold
demeanor
in
despair
at
this
change
at
his
apparent
indifference
germinie
feeling
bitter
and
hurt
confessed
to
him
one
day
in
the
confessional
the
hatred
that
had
taken
possession
of
her
for
two
young
girls
who
were
his
favorite
penitents
thereupon
the
priest
dismissed
her
without
discussion
and
sent
her
to
another
confessor
germinie
went
once
or
twice
to
confess
to
this
other
confessor
then
she
ceased
to
go
soon
she
ceased
even
to
think
of
going
and
of
all
her
religion
naught
remained
in
her
mind
but
a
certain
sweetness
like
the
faint
odor
of
incense
affairs
had
reached
that
point
when
mademoiselle
fell
ill
throughout
her
illness
as
germinie
did
not
want
to
leave
her
she
did
not
attend
mass
and
on
the
first
sunday
when
mademoiselle
being
fully
recovered
did
not
require
her
care
she
was
greatly
surprised
to
find
that
her
devotee
remained
at
home
and
did
not
run
away
to
church
oho
said
she
so
you
do
go
and
see
your
curés
nowadays
what
have
they
done
to
you
eh
nothing
said
germinie
v
there
mademoiselle
look
at
me
said
germinie
it
was
a
few
months
later
she
had
asked
her
mistress
permission
to
go
that
evening
to
the
wedding
ball
of
her
grocer
sister
who
had
chosen
her
for
her
and
she
had
come
to
exhibit
herself
grande
in
her
muslin
dress
mademoiselle
raised
her
eyes
from
the
old
volume
printed
in
large
type
which
she
was
reading
removed
her
spectacles
placed
them
in
the
book
to
mark
her
place
and
exclaimed
what
my
little
bigot
you
at
a
ball
do
you
know
my
girl
this
seems
to
me
downright
nonsense
you
and
the
hornpipe
faith
all
you
need
now
is
to
want
to
get
married
a
deuce
of
a
want
that
but
if
you
marry
i
warn
you
that
i
wo
keep
you
mind
that
i
no
desire
to
wait
on
your
brats
come
a
little
nearer
oho
why
bless
my
soul
mademoiselle
we
getting
to
be
a
bit
of
a
flirt
lately
i
find
why
no
mademoiselle
germinie
tried
to
say
and
then
continued
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
following
out
her
thought
among
you
people
the
men
are
such
sweet
creatures
spend
all
you
have
to
say
nothing
of
the
blows
but
marriage
i
am
sure
that
that
nonsensical
idea
of
getting
married
buzzes
around
in
your
head
when
you
see
the
others
that
what
gives
you
that
simper
i
wager
dieu
de
dieu
now
turn
a
bit
so
that
i
can
see
you
said
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
with
an
abrupt
change
of
tone
to
one
that
was
almost
caressing
and
placing
her
thin
hands
on
the
arms
of
her
crossing
her
legs
and
moving
her
foot
back
and
forth
she
set
about
inspecting
germinie
and
her
toilet
what
the
devil
said
she
after
a
few
moments
of
silent
scrutiny
what
is
it
really
you
then
i
have
never
used
my
eyes
to
look
at
good
god
yes
but
but
she
mumbled
more
vague
exclamations
between
her
where
the
deuce
did
you
get
that
mug
like
an
amorous
cat
she
said
at
last
and
continued
to
gaze
at
her
germinie
was
ugly
her
hair
of
so
dark
a
chestnut
that
it
seemed
black
curled
and
twisted
in
unruly
waves
in
little
stiff
rebellious
locks
which
escaped
and
stood
up
all
over
her
head
despite
the
pomade
upon
her
shiny
her
smooth
narrow
swelling
brow
protruded
above
the
shadow
of
the
deep
sockets
in
which
her
eyes
were
buried
and
sunken
to
such
a
depth
as
almost
to
denote
disease
small
bright
sparkling
eyes
they
were
made
to
seem
smaller
and
brighter
by
a
constant
girlish
twinkle
that
softened
and
lighted
up
their
laughter
they
were
neither
brown
eyes
nor
blue
eyes
but
were
of
an
undefinable
changing
gray
a
gray
that
was
not
a
color
but
a
light
emotion
found
expression
therein
in
the
flame
of
fever
pleasure
in
the
flashing
rays
of
a
sort
of
intoxication
passion
in
phosphorescence
her
short
nose
with
large
dilated
palpitating
nostrils
was
one
of
those
noses
of
which
the
common
people
say
that
it
rains
inside
upon
one
side
at
the
corner
of
the
eye
was
a
thick
swollen
blue
vein
the
square
head
of
the
lorraine
race
was
emphasized
in
her
broad
high
prominent
which
were
with
the
traces
of
the
most
noticeable
defect
in
her
face
was
the
too
great
distance
between
the
nose
and
mouth
this
lack
of
proportion
gave
an
almost
apish
character
to
the
lower
part
of
the
head
where
the
expansive
mouth
with
white
teeth
and
full
lips
that
looked
as
if
they
had
been
crushed
they
were
so
flat
smiled
at
you
with
a
strange
vaguely
irritating
smile
her
dress
disclosed
her
neck
the
upper
part
of
her
breast
her
shoulders
and
her
white
back
presenting
a
striking
contrast
to
her
swarthy
face
it
was
a
lymphatic
sort
of
whiteness
the
whiteness
at
once
unhealthy
and
angelic
of
flesh
in
which
there
is
no
life
she
had
let
her
arms
fall
by
her
sides
round
smooth
arms
with
a
pretty
dimple
at
the
elbow
her
wrists
were
delicate
her
hands
which
did
not
betray
the
servant
were
embellished
with
a
lady
fingernails
and
lazily
with
graceful
sloth
she
allowed
her
indolent
figure
to
curve
and
sway
a
figure
that
a
garter
might
span
and
that
was
made
even
more
slender
to
the
eye
by
the
projection
of
the
hips
and
the
curve
of
the
hoops
that
gave
the
roundness
to
her
skirt
an
impossible
waist
absurdly
small
but
adorable
like
everything
in
woman
that
offends
one
sense
of
proportion
by
its
diminutiveness
from
this
ugly
woman
emanated
a
piquant
mysterious
charm
light
and
shadow
jostling
and
intercepting
each
other
on
her
face
on
which
hollows
and
protuberances
abounded
imparted
to
it
that
suggestion
of
libertinism
which
the
painter
of
love
scenes
gives
to
the
rough
sketch
of
his
mistress
everything
about
her
her
mouth
her
eyes
her
very
plainness
was
instinct
with
allurement
and
solicitation
her
person
exhaled
an
aphrodisiac
charm
which
challenged
and
laid
fast
hold
of
the
other
sex
it
unloosed
desire
and
caused
an
electric
shock
sensual
thoughts
were
naturally
and
involuntarily
aroused
by
her
by
her
gestures
her
gait
her
slightest
movement
even
by
the
air
in
which
her
body
had
left
one
of
its
undulations
beside
her
one
felt
as
if
he
were
near
one
of
those
disturbing
disquieting
creatures
burning
with
the
love
disease
and
communicating
it
to
others
whose
face
appears
to
man
in
his
restless
hours
torments
his
listless
noonday
thoughts
haunts
his
nights
and
trespasses
upon
his
dreams
in
the
midst
of
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
scrutiny
germinie
stooped
over
her
and
covered
her
hand
with
hurried
kisses
there
there
enough
of
that
said
mademoiselle
you
would
soon
wear
out
the
skin
with
your
way
of
kissing
come
run
along
enjoy
yourself
and
try
not
to
stay
out
too
late
do
get
all
tired
out
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
was
left
alone
she
placed
her
elbows
on
her
knees
stared
at
the
fire
and
stirred
the
burning
wood
with
the
tongs
then
as
she
was
accustomed
to
do
when
deeply
preoccupied
she
struck
herself
two
or
three
sharp
little
blows
on
the
neck
with
the
flat
of
her
hand
and
thereby
set
her
black
cap
all
awry
vi
when
she
mentioned
the
subject
of
marriage
to
germinie
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
touched
upon
the
real
cause
of
her
trouble
she
placed
her
hand
upon
the
seat
of
her
her
maid
uneven
temper
her
distaste
for
life
the
languor
the
emptiness
the
discontent
of
her
existence
arose
from
that
disease
which
medical
science
calls
the
of
the
torment
of
her
years
was
the
ardent
excited
poignant
longing
for
marriage
for
that
state
which
was
too
holy
and
honorable
for
her
and
which
seemed
impossible
of
attainment
in
face
of
the
confession
her
womanly
probity
would
insist
upon
making
of
her
fall
and
her
unworthiness
family
losses
and
misfortunes
forcibly
diverted
her
mind
from
her
own
troubles
her
her
sister
the
concierge
husband
had
dreamed
the
dream
of
all
auvergnats
he
had
undertaken
to
increase
his
earnings
as
concierge
by
the
profits
of
a
dealer
in
he
had
begun
modestly
with
a
stall
in
the
street
at
the
doors
of
the
marts
where
executors
sales
are
held
and
there
you
could
see
set
out
upon
blue
paper
plated
candlesticks
ivory
napkin
rings
colored
lithographs
with
frames
of
gold
lace
on
a
black
ground
and
three
or
four
odd
volumes
of
buffon
his
profit
on
the
plated
candlesticks
intoxicated
him
he
hired
a
dark

opposite

began
to
trade
upon
the
credulity

out
of
the

sold

in
that
business
he
threw
away

he
had
made
and
ran
in
debt
to
the
amount
of
several
thousand
francs
his
wife
in
order
to
straighten
matters
out
a
little
and
to
try
and
get
out
of
debt
asked
for
and
obtained
a
place
as
at
the
she
hired
her
sister
the
dressmaker
to
watch
the
door
in
the
evening
went
to
bed
at
one
and
was
astir
again
at
five
after
a
few
months
she
caught
cold
in
the
corridors
of
the
theatre
and
an
attack
of
pleurisy
laid
her
low
and
carried
her
off
in
six
weeks
the
poor
woman
left
a
little
girl
three
years
old
who
was
taken
down
with
the
measles
the
disease
assumed
its
most
malignant
form
in
the
foul
stench
of
the
loft
where
the
child
had
breathed
for
more
than
a
month
air
poisoned
by
the
breath
of
her
dying
mother
the
father
had
gone
into
the
country
to
try
and
borrow
money
he
married
again
there
nothing
more
was
heard
of
him
when
returning
from
her
sister
burial
germinie
ran
to
the
house
of
an
old
woman
who
made
a
living
in
those
curious
industries
which
prevent
poverty
from
absolutely
starving
to
death
in
paris
this
old
woman
carried
on
several
trades
sometimes
she
cut
bristles
into
equal
lengths
for
brushes
sometimes
she
sorted
out
bits
of
gingerbread
when
those
industries
failed
she
did
cooking
and
washed
the
faces
of
children
in
lent
she
rose
at
four
in
the
morning
went
and
took
possession
of
a
chair
at
and
sold
it
for
ten
or
twelve
sous
when
the
crowd
arrived
in
order
to
procure
fuel
to
warm
herself
in
the
den
where
she
lived
on
rue
she
would
go
at
nightfall
to
the
luxembourg
and
peel
the
bark
off
the
trees
germinie
who
knew
her
from
having
given
her
the
crusts
from
the
kitchen
every
week
hired
a
servant
room
on
the
sixth
floor
of
the
house
and
took
up
her
abode
there
with
the
little
one
she
did
it
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
without
reflection
she
did
not
remember
her
sister
harsh
treatment
of
her
when
she
was
so
that
she
had
no
need
to
forgive
it
thenceforth
germinie
had
but
one
thought
her
niece
she
determined
to
rescue
her
from
death
and
restore
her
to
life
by
dint
of
careful
nursing
she
would
rush
away
from
mademoiselle
at
every
moment
run
up
the
stairs
to
the
sixth
floor
four
at
a
time
kiss
the
child
give
her
her
draught
arrange
her
comfortably
in
bed
look
at
her
and
rush
down
again
all
out
of
breath
and
red
with
pleasure
care
caresses
the
breath
from
the
heart
with
which
we
revive
a
tiny
flame
on
the
point
of
dying
out
consultations
doctor
visits
costly
medicines
the
remedies
of
the
wealthy
germinie
spared
nothing
for
the
little
one
and
gave
her
everything
her
wages
flowed
through
that
channel
for
almost
a
year
she
gave
her
beef
juice
every
morning
sleepyhead
that
she
was
she
left
her
bed
at
five
in
the
morning
to
prepare
it
and
awoke
without
being
called
as
mothers
do
the
child
was
out
of
danger
at
last
when
germinie
received
a
visit
one
morning
from
her
sister
the
dressmaker
who
had
been
married
two
or
three
years
to
a
machinist
and
who
came
now
to
bid
her
adieu
her
husband
was
going
to
accompany
some
who
had
been
hired
to
go
to
africa
she
was
going
with
him
and
she
proposed
to
germinie
that
they
should
take
the
little
one
with
them
as
a
playmate
for
their
own
child
they
offered
to
take
her
off
her
hands
germinie
they
said
would
have
to
pay
only
for
the
journey
it
was
a
separation
she
would
have
to
make
up
her
mind
to
sooner
or
later
on
account
of
her
mistress
and
then
said
the
sister
she
was
the
child
aunt
too
and
she
heaped
words
upon
words
to
induce
germinie
to
give
them
the
child
with
whom
she
and
her
husband
expected
after
their
arrival
in
africa
to
move
germinie
to
pity
to
get
possession
of
her
wages
to
play
upon
her
heart
and
her
purse
it
cost
germinie
very
dear
to
part
with
her
niece
she
had
staked
a
portion
of
her
existence
upon
the
child
she
was
attached
to
her
by
her
anxiety
and
her
sacrifices
she
had
disputed
possession
of
her
with
disease
and
had
won
the
day
the
girl
life
was
her
miracle
and
yet
she
realized
that
she
could
never
take
her
to
mademoiselle
apartments
that
mademoiselle
at
her
age
with
the
burden
of
her
years
and
an
aged
person
need
of
tranquillity
could
never
endure
the
constant
noise
and
movement
of
a
child
and
then
the
little
girl
presence
in
the
house
would
cause
idle
gossip
and
set
the
whole
street
agog
people
would
say
she
was
her
child
germinie
made
a
confidante
of
her
mistress
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
knew
the
whole
story
she
knew
that
she
had
taken
charge
of
her
niece
although
she
had
pretended
not
to
know
it
she
had
chosen
to
see
nothing
in
order
to
permit
everything
she
advised
germinie
to
entrust
her
niece
to
her
sister
pointing
out
to
her
all
the
difficulties
in
the
way
of
keeping
her
herself
and
she
gave
her
money
to
pay
for
the
journey
of
the
whole
family
the
parting
was
a
thing
to
germinie
she
found
herself
left
alone
and
without
occupation
not
having
the
child
she
knew
not
what
to
love
her
heart
was
weary
and
she
had
such
a
feeling
of
the
emptiness
of
life
without
the
little
one
that
she
turned
once
more
to
religion
and
transferred
her
affections
to
the
church
three
months
had
passed
when
she
received
news
of
her
sister
death
the
husband
who
was
one
of
the
whining
lachrymose
breed
of
mechanics
gave
her
in
his
letter
mingled
with
labored
moving
phrases
and
threads
of
pathos
a
despairing
picture
of
his
position
with
the
burial
to
pay
for
attacks
of
fever
that
prevented
him
from
working
two
young
children
without
counting
the
little
girl
and
a
household
with
no
wife
to
heat
the
soup
germinie
wept
over
the
letter
then
her
thoughts
turned
to
living
in
that
house
beside
that
poor
man
among
the
poor
children
in
that
horrible
africa
and
a
vague
longing
to
sacrifice
herself
began
to
awaken
within
her
other
letters
followed
in
which
while
thanking
her
for
her
assistance
her
gave
to
his
poverty
to
his
desolate
plight
to
the
misery
that
enveloped
him
a
still
more
dramatic
coloring
the
coloring
that
the
common
people
impart
to
trifles
with
its
memories
of
the
boulevard
du
crime
and
its
fragments
of
vile
books
once
caught
by
the
of
this
misery
germinie
could
not
cut
loose
from
it
she
fancied
she
could
hear
the
cries
of
the
children
calling
her
she
became
completely
absorbed
buried
in
the
project
and
resolution
of
going
to
them
she
was
haunted
by
the
idea
and
by
the
word
africa
which
she
turned
over
and
over
incessantly
in
the
depths
of
her
mind
without
a
word
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
noticing
her
thoughtfulness
and
melancholy
asked
her
what
the
matter
was
but
in
vain
germinie
did
not
speak
she
was
pulled
this
way
and
that
tormented
between
what
seemed
to
her
a
duty
and
what
seemed
to
her
ingratitude
between
her
mistress
and
her
sisters
blood
she
thought
that
she
could
not
leave
mademoiselle
and
again
she
said
to
herself
that
god
did
not
wish
her
to
abandon
her
family
she
would
look
about
the
apartment
and
mutter
and
yet
i
must
go
then
she
would
fear
that
mademoiselle
might
be
sick
when
she
was
not
there
another
maid
at
that
thought
she
was
seized
with
jealousy
and
fancied
that
she
could
already
see
someone
stealing
her
mistress
at
other
moments
when
her
religious
ideas
impelled
her
to
thoughts
of
she
was
all
ready
to
devote
her
existence
to
this
she
determined
to
go
and
live
with
this
man
whom
she
detested
with
whom
she
had
always
been
on
the
worst
of
terms
who
had
almost
killed
her
sister
with
grief
whom
she
knew
to
be
a
brutish
drunken
sot
and
all
that
she
anticipated
all
that
she
dreaded
the
certainty
of
all
she
would
have
to
suffer
and
her
shrinking
fear
of
it
served
to
exalt
and
inflame
her
imagination
to
urge
her
on
to
the
sacrifice
with
the
greater
impatience
and
ardor
often
the
whole
scheme
fell
to
the
ground
in
an
instant
at
a
word
at
a
gesture
from
mademoiselle
germinie
would
become
herself
once
more
and
would
fail
to
recognize
herself
she
felt
that
she
was
bound
to
her
mistress
absolutely
and
forever
and
she
had
a
thrill
of
horror
at
having
so
much
as
thought
of
detaching
her
own
life
from
hers
she
struggled
thus
for
two
years
then
she
learned
one
fine
day
by
chance
that
her
niece
had
died
a
few
weeks
after
her
sister
her
had
concealed
the
child
death
in
order
to
maintain
his
hold
upon
her
and
to
lure
her
to
him
in
africa
with
her
few
sous
illusions
being
wholly
dispelled
by
that
revelation
she
was
cured
on
the
spot
she
hardly
remembered
that
she
had
ever
thought
of
going
away
vii
about
this
time
a
small
creamery
at
the
end
of
the
street
with
few
customers
changed
hands
as
a
result
of
the
sale
of
the
real
estate
by
order
of
court
the
shop
was
renovated
and
repainted
the
front
windows
were
embellished
with
inscriptions
in
yellow
letters
pyramids
of
chocolate
from
the
compagnie
coloniale
and
filled
with
flowers
alternating
with
small
liqueur
glasses
were
displayed
upon
the
shelves
at
the
door
glistened
the
sign
a
copper
milk
jug
divided
in
the
middle
the
woman
who
thus
endeavored
to
the
concern
the
new
was
a
person
of
about
fifty
years
of
age
whose
corpulence
passed
all
bounds
and
who
still
retained
some
of
beauty
half
submerged
in
fat
it
was
said
in
the
quarter
that
she
had
set
herself
up
in
business
with
the
money
of
an
old
gentleman
whose
servant
she
had
been
until
his
death
in
her
native
province
near
langres
for
it
happened
that
she
was
a
countrywoman
of
germinie
not
from
the
same
village
but
from
a
small
place
near
by
and
although
she
and
mademoiselle
maid
had
never
met
nor
seen
each
other
in
the
country
they
knew
each
other
by
name
and
were
drawn
together
by
the
fact
that
they
had
acquaintances
in
common
and
could
compare
memories
of
the
same
places
the
stout
woman
was
a
flattering
affected
fawning
creature
she
said
my
love
to
everybody
talked
in
a
piping
voice
and
played
the
child
with
the
querulous
languor
of
corpulent
persons
she
detested
vulgar
remarks
and
would
blush
and
take
alarm
at
trifles
she
adored
secrets
twisted
everything
into
a
confidential
communication
invented
stories
and
always
whispered
in
your
ear
her
life
was
passed
in
gossiping
and
groaning
she
pitied
others
and
she
pitied
herself
she
lamented
her
ill
fortune
and
her
stomach
when
she
had
eaten
too
much
she
would
say
dramatically
i
am
dying
and
nothing
ever
was
so
pathetic
as
her
indigestion
she
was
constantly
moved
to
tears
she
wept
indiscriminately
for
a
maltreated
horse
for
someone
who
had
died
for
milk
that
had
curdled
she
wept
over
the
various
items
in
the
newspapers
she
wept
for
the
sake
of
weeping
germinie
was
very
soon
ensnared
and
moved
to
pity
by
this
wheedling
talkative
who
was
always
in
a
state
of
intense
emotion
calling
upon
others
to
open
their
hearts
to
her
and
apparently
so
affectionate
after
three
months
hardly
anything
passed
doors
that
did
not
come
from
mère
jupillon
germinie
procured
everything
or
almost
everything
there
she
passed
hours
in
the
shop
once
there
it
was
hard
work
for
her
to
leave
she
remained
there
unable
to
rise
from
her
chair
a
sort
of
instinctive
cowardice
detained
her
at
the
door
she
would
stop
and
talk
on
in
order
to
delay
her
departure
she
felt
bound
to
the
by
the
invisible
charm
of
familiar
places
to
which
you
constantly
return
and
which
end
by
embracing
you
like
things
that
would
love
you
and
then
too
in
her
eyes
the
shop
meant
madame
jupillon
three
dogs
three
wretched
curs
she
always
had
them
on
her
knees
she
scolded
them
and
kissed
them
and
talked
to
them
and
when
she
was
warm
with
their
warmth
she
would
feel
in
the
depths
of
her
heart
the
contentment
of
a
beast
rubbing
against
her
little
ones
again
the
shop
to
her
meant
all
the
gossip
of
the
quarter
the
rendezvous
of
all
the
scandals
how
this
one
had
failed
to
pay
her
note
and
that
one
had
received
a
carriage
load
of
flowers
it
meant
a
place
that
was
on
the
watch
for
everything
even
to
the
lace
going
to
town
on
the
maid
arm
in
a
word
everything
tended
to
attach
her
to
the
place
her
intimacy
with
the
was
strengthened
by
all
the
mysterious
bonds
of
friendship
between
women
of
the
people
by
the
continual
chatter
the
daily
exchange
of
the
trivial
affairs
of
life
the
conversation
for
the
sake
of
conversing
the
repetition
of
the
same
and
the
same
the
division
of
caresses
among
the
same
animals
the
naps
side
by
side
and
chair
against
chair
the
shop
at
last
became
her
regular
place
for
idling
away
her
time
a
place
where
her
thoughts
her
words
her
body
and
her
very
limbs
were
marvelously
at
ease
there
came
a
time
when
her
happiness
consisted
in
sitting
drowsily
of
an
evening
in
a
straw
beside
mère
jupillon
sound
asleep
with
her
spectacles
on
her
nose
and
holding
the
dogs
rolled
in
a
ball
in
the
skirt
of
her
dress
and
while
the
lamp
almost
dying
burned
pale
upon
the
counter
she
would
sit
idly
there
letting
her
glance
lose
itself
at
the
back
of
the
shop
and
gradually
grow
dim
with
her
ideas
as
her
eyes
rested
vaguely
upon
a
triumphal
arch
of
snail
shells
joined
together
with
old
moss
beneath
which
stood
a
little
copper
napoléon
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
viii
madame
jupillon
who
claimed
to
have
been
married
and
signed
herself
had
a
son
he
was
still
a
child
she
had
placed
him
at
the
great
religious
establishment
where
for
thirty
francs
a
month
rudimentary
instruction
and
a
trade
are
furnished
to
the
children
of
the
common
people
and
to
many
natural
children
germinie
fell
into
the
way
of
accompanying
madame
jupillon
when
she
went
to
see
on
thursdays
this
visit
became
a
means
of
distraction
to
her
something
to
look
forward
to
she
would
urge
the
mother
to
hurry
would
always
arrive
first
at
the
omnibus
office
and
was
content
to
sit
with
her
arms
resting
on
a
huge
basket
of
provisions
all
the
way
it
happened
that
mère
jupillon
had
trouble
with
her
leg
a
carbuncle
that
prevented
her
from
walking
for
nearly
eighteen
months
germinie
went
alone
to
and
as
she
was
promptly
and
easily
led
to
devote
herself
to
others
she
took
as
deep
an
interest
in
that
child
as
if
he
were
connected
with
her
in
some
way
she
did
not
miss
a
single
thursday
and
always
arrived
with
her
hands
full
of
the
last
desserts
and
with
cakes
and
fruit
and
sweetmeats
she
had
bought
she
would
kiss
the
urchin
inquire
for
his
health
and
feel
to
see
if
he
had
his
knitted
vest
under
his
blouse
she
would
notice
how
flushed
he
was
from
running
would
wipe
his
face
with
her
handkerchief
and
make
him
show
her
the
soles
of
his
shoes
so
that
she
could
see
if
there
were
any
holes
in
them
she
would
ask
if
his
teachers
were
satisfied
with
him
if
he
attended
to
his
duties
and
if
he
had
had
many
good
marks
she
would
talk
to
him
of
his
mother
and
bid
him
love
the
good
lord
and
until
the
clock
struck
two
she
would
walk
with
him
in
the
courtyard
the
child
would
offer
her
his
arm
as
proud
as
you
please
to
be
with
a
woman
much
better
dressed
than
the
majority
of
those
who
came
there
with
a
woman
in
silk
he
was
anxious
to
learn
the
flageolet
it
cost
only
five
francs
a
month
but
his
mother
would
not
give
them
germinie
carried
him
the
hundred
sous
every
month
on
the
sly
it
was
a
humiliating
thing
to
him
to
wear
the
little
uniform
blouse
when
he
went
out
to
walk
and
on
the
two
or
three
occasions
during
the
year
when
he
went
to
see
his
mother
on
his
birthday
one
year
germinie
unfolded
a
large
parcel
before
him
she
had
had
a
tunic
made
for
him
it
is
doubtful
if
twenty
of
his
comrades
in
the
whole
school
belonged
to
families
in
sufficiently
easy
circumstances
to
wear
such
garments
she
spoiled
him
thus
for
several
years
not
allowing
him
to
suffer
with
a
longing
for
anything
encouraging
the
caprices
and
the
pride
of
wealthy
children
in
the
poor
child
softening
for
him
the
privations
and
hardships
of
that
trade
school
where
children
were
formed
for
a
laboring
life
wore
blouses
and
ate
off
plates
of
brown
earthenware
a
school
that
by
its
toilsome
apprenticeship
hardened
the
children
of
the
people
to
lives
of
toil
meanwhile
the
boy
was
growing
fast
germinie
did
not
notice
it
in
her
eyes
he
was
still
the
child
he
had
always
been
from
habit
she
always
stooped
to
kiss
him
one
day
she
was
summoned
before
the
abbé
who
was
at
the
head
of
the
school
he
spoke
to
her
of
expelling
jupillon
obscene
books
had
been
found
in
his
possession
germinie
trembling
at
the
thought
of
the
blows
that
awaited
the
child
at
his
mother
hands
prayed
and
begged
and
implored
she
succeeded
at
last
in
inducing
the
abbé
to
forgive
the
culprit
when
she
went
down
into
the
courtyard
again
she
attempted
to
scold
him
but
at
the
first
word
of
her
moral
lecture
bibi
suddenly
cast
in
her
face
a
glance
and
smile
in
which
there
was
no
trace
of
the
child
that
he
was
the
day
before
she
lowered
her
eyes
and
she
was
the
one
to
blush
a
fortnight
passed
before
she
went
again
to
ix
about
the
time
that
young
jupillon
left
the
a
maid
in
the
service
of
a
kept
woman
who
lived
on
the
floor
below
mademoiselle
sometimes
passed
the
evening
with
germinie
at
madame
jupillon
a
native
of
the
grand
duchy
of
luxembourg
which
supplies
paris
with
coupé
drivers
and
lorettes
this
girl
was
what
is
called
in
vulgar
parlance
a
great
she
was
an
awkward
creature
with
the
eyebrows
of
a
water
carrier
she
soon
fell
into
the
habit
of
going
there
every
evening
she
treated
everybody
to
cakes
and
liquors
amused
herself
by
showing
off
little
jupillon
playing
with
him
sitting
on
his
knee
telling
him
to
his
face
that
he
was
a
beauty
treating
him
like
a
child
playing
the
wanton
with
him
and
joking
him
because
he
was
not
a
man
the
boy
happy
and
proud
of
these
attentions
from
the
first
woman
who
had
ever
taken
notice
of
him
manifested
before
long
his
preference
for
adèle
so
was
the
called
germinie
was
passionately
jealous
jealousy
was
the
foundation
of
her
nature
it
was
the
dregs
of
her
affection
and
gave
it
its
bitter
taste
those
whom
she
loved
she
wished
to
have
entirely
to
herself
to
possess
them
absolutely
she
demanded
that
they
should
love
no
one
but
her
she
could
not
permit
them
to
take
from
her
and
bestow
upon
others
the
slightest
fragment
of
their
affection
as
she
had
earned
it
it
no
longer
belonged
to
them
they
were
no
longer
entitled
to
dispose
of
it
she
detested
the
people
whom
her
mistress
seemed
to
welcome
more
cordially
than
others
and
with
whom
she
was
on
most
intimate
terms
by
her
and
her
sullen
manner
she
had
offended
had
almost
driven
from
the
house
two
or
three
of
mademoiselle
old
friends
whose
visits
wounded
her
as
if
the
old
ladies
came
there
for
the
purpose
of
abstracting
something
from
the
rooms
of
taking
a
little
of
her
mistress
from
her
people
of
whom
she
had
once
been
fond
became
odious
to
her
she
did
not
consider
that
they
were
fond
enough
of
her
she
hated
them
for
all
the
love
she
wanted
from
them
her
heart
was
despotic
and
exacting
in
everything
as
it
gave
all
it
demanded
all
in
return
at
the
least
sign
of
coldness
at
the
slightest
indication
that
she
had
a
rival
she
would
fly
into
a
rage
tear
her
hair
pass
her
nights
in
weeping
and
execrate
the
whole
world
seeing
that
other
woman
make
herself
at
home
in
the
shop
and
adopt
a
tone
of
familiarity
with
the
young
man
all
germinie
jealous
instincts
were
aroused
and
changed
to
furious
rage
her
hatred
flew
to
arms
and
rebelled
with
her
disgust
against
the
shameless
creature
who
could
be
seen
on
sunday
sitting
at
table
on
the
outer
boulevards
with
soldiers
and
who
had
blue
marks
on
her
face
on
monday
she
did
her
utmost
to
induce
madame
jupillon
to
turn
her
away
but
she
was
one
of
the
best
customers
of
the
creamery
and
the
mildly
refused
to
close
her
doors
upon
her
germinie
had
recourse
to
the
son
and
told
him
that
she
was
a
miserable
creature
but
that
only
served
to
attach
the
young
man
the
closer
to
the
vile
woman
whose
evil
reputation
delighted
him
moreover
he
had
the
cruel
mischievous
instinct
of
youth
and
he
redoubled
his
attentions
to
her
simply
to
see
the
nose
that
germinie
made
and
to
enjoy
her
despair
soon
germinie
discovered
that
the
woman
intentions
were
more
serious
than
she
had
at
first
supposed
she
began
to
understand
what
she
wanted
of
the
child
for
the
tall
youth
of
seventeen
was
still
a
child
in
her
eyes
thenceforward
she
hung
upon
their
steps
she
was
always
beside
them
never
left
them
alone
for
a
moment
made
one
at
all
their
parties
at
the
theatre
or
in
the
country
joined
them
in
all
their
walks
was
always
at
hand
and
in
the
way
seeking
to
hold
adèle
back
and
to
restore
her
sense
of
decency
by
a
word
in
an
undertone
a
mere
boy
ai
you
ashamed
she
would
say
to
her
and
the
other
would
laugh
aloud
as
if
it
were
a
good
joke
when
they
left
the
theatre
enlivened
and
heated
by
the
feverish
excitement
of
the
performance
and
the
place
when
they
returned
from
an
excursion
to
the
country
laden
with
a
long
day
sunshine
intoxicated
with
the
blue
sky
and
the
pure
air
excited
by
the
wine
imbibed
at
dinner
amid
the
sportive
liberties
in
which
the
woman
of
the
people
drunk
with
enjoyment
and
with
the
delights
of
unlimited
good
cheer
and
with
the
senses
keyed
up
to
the
highest
pitch
of
joviality
makes
bold
to
indulge
at
night
germinie
tried
to
be
always
between
the
maid
and
jupillon
she
never
relaxed
her
efforts
to
break
the
lovers
hold
upon
each
other
arms
to
unbind
them
to
uncouple
them
never
wearying
of
the
task
she
was
forever
separating
them
luring
them
away
from
each
other
she
placed
her
body
between
those
bodies
that
were
groping
for
each
other
she
glided
between
the
hands
outstretched
to
touch
each
other
she
glided
between
the
lips
that
were
put
forth
in
search
of
other
proffered
lips
but
of
all
this
that
she
prevented
she
felt
the
breath
and
the
shock
she
felt
the
pressure
of
the
hands
she
held
apart
the
caresses
that
she
caught
on
the
wing
and
that
missed
their
mark
and
went
astray
upon
her
the
hot
breath
of
the
kisses
she
intercepted
blew
upon
her
cheek
involuntarily
and
with
a
feeling
of
horror
she
became
a
party
to
the
embracing
she
was
infected
with
the
desires
aroused
by
this
constant
friction
and
struggling
which
diminished
day
by
day
the
young
man
restraint
and
respect
for
her
person
it
happened
one
day
that
she
was
less
strong
against
herself
than
she
had
previously
been
on
that
occasion
she
did
not
elude
his
advances
so
abruptly
as
usual
jupillon
felt
that
she
stopped
short
germinie
felt
it
even
more
keenly
than
he
but
she
was
at
the
end
of
her
efforts
exhausted
with
the
torture
she
had
undergone
the
love
which
coming
from
another
she
had
turned
aside
from
jupillon
had
slowly
taken
full
possession
of
her
own
heart
now
it
was
firmly
rooted
there
and
bleeding
with
jealousy
she
found
that
she
was
incapable
of
resistance
weak
and
fainting
like
a
person
fatally
wounded
in
presence
of
the
joy
that
had
come
to
her
she
repelled
the
young
man
audacious
attempts
however
without
a
word
she
did
not
dream
of
belonging
to
him
otherwise
than
as
a
friend
or
giving
way
farther
than
she
had
done
she
lived
upon
the
thought
of
love
believing
that
she
could
live
upon
it
always
and
in
the
ecstatic
exaltation
of
her
thoughts
she
put
aside
all
memory
of
her
fall
and
repressed
her
desires
she
remained
shuddering
and
pure
lost
and
suspended
in
abysses
of
affection
neither
enjoying
nor
wishing
for
aught
from
the
lover
but
a
caress
as
if
her
heart
were
made
only
for
the
joy
of
kissing
x
this
happy
though
unsatisfied
love
produced
a
strange
physiological
phenomenon
in
germinie
physical
being
one
would
have
said
that
the
passion
that
was
alive
within
her
renewed
and
transformed
her
lymphatic
temperament
she
did
not
seem
as
before
to
extract
her
life
drop
by
drop
from
a
penurious
spring
it
flowed
through
her
arteries
in
a
full
generous
stream
she
felt
the
tingling
sensation
of
rich
blood
over
her
whole
body
she
seemed
to
be
filled
with
the
warm
glow
of
health
and
the
joy
of
living
beat
its
wings
in
her
breast
like
a
bird
in
the
sunlight
a
marvelous
animation
had
come
to
her
the
miserable
nervous
energy
that
once
sustained
her
had
given
place
to
healthy
activity
to
bustling
restless
overflowing
gayety
she
had
no
trace
now
of
the
weakness
the
dejection
the
prostration
the
supineness
the
sluggishness
that
formerly
distinguished
her
the
heavy
drowsy
feeling
in
the
morning
was
a
thing
of
the
past
she
awoke
feeling
fresh
and
bright
and
alive
in
an
instant
to
the
cheer
of
the
new
day
she
dressed
in
haste
playfully
her
agile
fingers
moved
of
themselves
and
she
was
amazed
to
be
so
bright
and
full
of
activity
during
the
hours
of
faintness
before
breakfast
when
she
had
so
often
felt
her
heart
upon
her
lips
and
throughout
the
day
she
had
the
same
consciousness
of
physical
the
same
briskness
of
movement
she
must
be
always
on
the
move
walking
running
doing
something
expending
her
strength
at
times
all
that
she
had
lived
through
seemed
to
have
no
existence
the
sensations
of
living
that
she
had
hitherto
experienced
seemed
to
her
like
a
dream
or
as
if
dimly
seen
in
the
background
of
a
sleeping
memory
the
past
lay
behind
her
as
if
she
had
traversed
it
covered
with
a
veil
like
one
in
a
swoon
or
with
the
unconsciousness
of
a
somnambulist
it
was
the
first
time
that
she
had
experienced
the
feeling
the
impression
at
once
bitter
and
sweet
violent
and
celestial
of
the
game
of
life
brilliant
in
its
plenitude
its
regularity
and
its
power
she
ran
up
and
downstairs
for
a
nothing
at
a
word
from
mademoiselle
she
would
trip
down
the
whole
five
flights
when
she
was
seated
her
feet
danced
on
the
floor
she
brushed
and
scrubbed
and
beat
and
shook
and
washed
and
set
to
rights
without
rest
or
reprieve
always
at
work
filling
the
apartment
with
her
goings
and
comings
and
the
incessant
bustle
that
followed
her
mon
dieu
her
mistress
would
say
stunned
by
the
uproar
she
made
just
like
a
child
you
turning
things
upside
down
germinie
that
will
do
for
that
one
day
when
she
went
into
germinie
kitchen
mademoiselle
saw
a
little
earth
in
a
cigar
box
on
the
what
that
she
that
grass
that
i
planted
to
look
at
said
so
you
in
love
with
grass
now
eh
all
you
need
now
is
to
have
canaries
xi
in
the
course
of
a
few
months
germinie
life
her
whole
life
belonged
to
the
mademoiselle
service
was
not
exacting
and
took
but
little
time
a
whiting
or
a
cutlet
that
was
all
the
cooking
there
was
to
be
done
mademoiselle
might
have
kept
her
with
her
in
the
evening
for
company
she
preferred
however
to
send
her
away
to
drive
her
out
of
doors
to
force
her
to
take
a
little
air
and
diversion
she
asked
only
that
she
would
return
at
ten
to
help
her
to
bed
and
yet
when
germinie
was
a
little
late
mademoiselle
undressed
herself
and
went
to
bed
alone
very
comfortably
every
hour
that
her
mistress
left
her
at
leisure
germinie
passed
in
the
shop
she
fell
into
the
habit
of
going
down
to
the
creamery
in
the
morning
when
the
shutters
were
removed
and
generally
carried
them
inside
she
would
take
her
au
there
and
remain
until
nine
when
she
would
go
back
and
give
mademoiselle
her
chocolate
and
between
breakfast
and
dinner
she
found
excuses
for
returning
two
or
three
times
delaying
and
chattering
in
the
on
the
slightest
pretext
what
a
magpie
you
are
getting
to
be
mademoiselle
would
say
in
a
scolding
voice
but
with
a
smiling
face
at
half
past
five
when
her
mistress
little
dinner
was
cleared
away
she
would
run
down
the
stairs
four
at
a
time
install
herself
at
mère
jupillon
wait
until
ten
clamber
up
the
five
flights
and
in
five
minutes
undress
her
mistress
who
submitted
unresistingly
albeit
she
was
somewhat
astonished
that
germinie
should
be
in
such
haste
to
go
to
bed
she
remembered
the
time
when
she
had
a
mania
for
moving
her
sleepy
body
from
one
to
another
and
was
never
willing
to
go
up
to
her
room
while
the
candle
was
still
smoking
on
night
table
germinie
would
be
back
at
the
creamery
this
time
to
remain
until
midnight
until
one
often
she
did
not
go
until
a
policeman
noticing
the
light
tapped
on
the
shutters
and
made
them
close
up
in
order
to
be
always
there
and
to
have
the
right
to
be
always
there
to
make
herself
a
part
of
the
shop
to
keep
her
eyes
constantly
upon
the
man
she
loved
to
hover
about
him
to
keep
him
to
be
always
brushing
against
him
she
had
become
the
servant
of
the
establishment
she
swept
the
shop
she
prepared
the
old
woman
meals
and
the
food
for
the
dogs
she
waited
upon
the
son
she
made
his
bed
she
brushed
his
clothes
she
waxed
his
boots
happy
and
proud
to
touch
what
he
touched
thrilling
with
pleasure
when
she
placed
her
hand
where
he
placed
his
body
and
ready
to
kiss
the
mud
upon
the
leather
of
his
boots
because
it
was
his
she
did
the
menial
work
she
kept
the
shop
she
served
the
customers
madame
jupillon
rested
everything
upon
her
shoulders
and
while
the
girl
was
working
and
perspiring
the
bulky
matron
assuming
the
majestic
leisurely
air
of
an
annuitant
anchored
upon
a
chair
in
the
middle
of
the
sidewalk
and
inhaling
the
fresh
air
of
the
street
fingered
and
rattled
the
precious
coin
in
the
capacious
pocket
beneath
her
apron
the
coin
that
rings
so
sweetly
in
the
ears
of
the
petty
tradesmen
of
paris
that
the
retired
shopkeeper
is
melancholy
beyond
words
at
first
because
he
no
longer
has

when
the
spring
came
germinie
said
to
jupillon
almost
every
evening
suppose
we
go
as
far
as
the
beginning
of
the
fields
jupillon
would
put
on
his
flannel
shirt
with
red
and
black
squares
and
his
black
velvet
cap
and
they
would
start
for
what
the
people
of
the
quarter
call
the
beginning
of
the
fields
they
would
go
up
the
chaussée
clignancourt
and
with
the
flood
of
parisians
from
the
faubourg
hurrying
to
drink
a
little
fresh
air
would
walk
on
toward
the
great
patch
of
sky
that
rose
straight
from
the
pavements
at
the
top
of
the
ascent
between
the
two
lines
of
houses
unobstructed
except
by
an
occasional
omnibus
the
air
was
growing
cooler
and
the
sun
shone
only
upon
the
roofs
of
the
houses
and
the
chimneys
as
from
a
great
door
opening
into
the
country
there
came
from
the
end
of
the
street
and
from
the
sky
beyond
a
breath
of
boundless
space
and
liberty
at
the
they
found
the
first
tree
the
first
foliage
then
at
rue
du
château
the
horizon
opened
before
them
in
dazzling
beauty
the
fields
stretched
away
in
the
distance
glistening
vaguely
in
the
powdery
golden
haze
of
seven
all
nature
trembled
in
the
daylight
dust
that
the
day
leaves
in
its
wake
upon
the
verdure
it
blots
from
sight
and
the
houses
it
suffuses
with
pink
frequently
they
descended
the
footpath
covered
with
the
figures
of
the
game
of
marked
out
in
charcoal
by
long
walls
with
an
occasional
overhanging
branch
by
lines
of
detached
houses
with
gardens
between
at
their
left
rose
filled
with
light
clustering
foliage
pierced
by
the
beams
of
the
setting
sun
which
cast
lines
of
fire
across
the
bars
of
the
iron
gateways
after
the
gardens
came
hedgerows
estates
for
sale
unfinished
buildings
erected
upon
the
line
of
projected
streets
and
stretching
out
their
jagged
walls
into
empty
space
with
heaps
of
broken
bottles
at
their
feet
large
low
plastered
houses
with
windows
filled
with
and
cloths
and
with
the
y
of
the
at
every
floor
and
openings
into
enclosures
that
resembled
barnyards
studded
with
little
mounds
on
which
goats
were
browsing
they
would
stop
here
and
there
and
smell
the
flowers
inhale
the
perfume
of
a
meagre
lilac
growing
in
a
narrow
lane
germinie
would
pluck
a
leaf
in
passing
and
nibble
at
it
flocks
of
joyous
swallows
flew
wildly
about
in
circles
and
in
fantastic
figures
over
her
head
the
birds
called
the
sky
answered
the
cages
she
heard
everything
about
her
singing
and
glanced
with
a
glad
eye
at
the
women
in
chemisettes
at
the
windows
the
men
in
their
shirt
sleeves
in
the
little
gardens
the
mothers
on
the
doorsteps

their
little
ones

at
the
fortifications
her
pleasure
returned
she
would
go
with
jupillon
and
sit
upon
the
slope
of
the
embankment
beside
her
were
families
innumerable
workmen
lying
flat
upon
their
faces
small
annuitants
gazing
at
the
horizon
through
philosophers
of
want
bent
double
with
their
hands
upon
their
knees
the
greasy
coats
characteristic
of
old
men
and
black
hats
worn
as
red
as
their
red
at
the
foot
of
the
slope
the
pavement
came
to
an
end
the
street
was
succeeded
by
a
broad
white
chalky
dusty
road
made
of
débris
old
pieces
of
plaster
crumbs
of
lime
and
bricks
a
sunken
road
with
deep
ruts
polished
on
the
edges
made
by
the
iron
tires
of
the
huge
great
wheels
of
carts
laden
with
hewn
stone
at
that
point
began
the
things
that
collect
where
paris
ends
the
things
that
grow
where
grass
does
not
grow
one
of
those
arid
landscapes
that
large
cities
create
around
them
the
first
zone
of
suburbs
where
nature
is
exhausted
the
soil
used
up
the
fields
sown
with
oyster
shells
beyond
was
a
wilderness
of
yards
displaying
numbers
of
carts
and
trucks
with
their
shafts
in
the
air
against
the
sky
sheds
factories
built
of
boards
unfinished
workmen
houses
full
of
gaps
and
open
to
the
light
and
bearing
the
mason
flag
wastes
of
gray
and
white
sand
kitchen
gardens
marked
out
with
cords
and
on
the
lower
level
bogs
to
which
the
embankment
of
the
road
slopes
down
in
oceans
of
small
stones
soon
they
would
reach
the
last
lantern
hanging
on
a
green
post
people
were
still
coming
and
going
about
them
the
road
was
alive
and
amused
the
eyes
they
met
women
carrying
their
husband
canes
lorettes
in
silk
dresses
leaning
on
the
arms
of
their
brothers
old
women
in
ginghams
walking
about
with
folded
arms
enjoying
a
moment
rest
from
labor
workmen
were
drawing
their
children
in
little
wagons
urchins
returning
with
their
rods
from
fishing
at
and
men
and
women
dragging
branches
of
flowering
acacia
at
the
ends
of
sticks
sometimes
a
pregnant
woman
would
pass
holding
out
her
arms
to
a
yet
small
child
and
casting
the
shadow
of
her
pregnancy
upon
the
wall
and
everyone
moved
tranquilly
blissfully
at
a
pace
that
told
of
the
wish
to
delay
with
the
awkward
ease
and
the
happy
indolence
of
those
who
walk
for
pleasure
no
one
was
in
a
hurry
and
against
the
unbroken
horizon
line
crossed
from
time
to
time
by
the
white
smoke
of
a
railroad
train
the
groups
of
promenaders
were
like
black
spots
almost
motionless
in
the
distance
behind
montmartre
they
came
to
those
great
moats
as
it
were
those
sloping
squares
where
narrow
gray
paths
cross
and
recross
a
few
blades
of
shriveled
yellow
grass
grew
thereabout
softened
by
the
rays
of
the
setting
sun
which
they
could
see
all
ablaze
between
the
houses
and
germinie
loved
to
watch
the
at
work
there
the
quarry
horses
at
pasture
in
the
bare
fields
the
trousers
of
the
soldiers
who
were
playing
at
bowls
the
children
flying
kites
that
made
black
spots
in
the
clear
air
passing
all
these
they
turned
to
cross
the
bridge
over
the
railroad
by
the
wretched
settlement
of
ragpickers
the
stonemasons
quarter
at
the
foot
of
clignancourt
hill
they
would
walk
quickly
by
those
houses
built
of
materials
stolen
from
demolished
buildings
and
exuding
the
horrors
they
conceal
the
wretched
structures
half
cabin
half
burrow
caused
germinie
a
vague
feeling
of
terror
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
all
the
crimes
of
night
were
lurking
there
but
at
the
fortifications
her
pleasure
returned
she
would
go
with
jupillon
and
sit
upon
the
slope
of
the
embankment
beside

lying

upon

the
greasy
coats
characteristic
of
old

and
black
hats
worn
as
red
as
their
red
beards
the
air
was
full
of
rich
harmonies
below
her
in
the
moat
a
musical
society
was
playing
at
each
corner
before
her
eyes
was
a
crowd
white
blouses
children
in
blue
aprons
running
around
a
game
of
riding
at
the
ring
in
progress
wine
shops
cake
shops
fried
fish
stalls
and
shooting
galleries
half
hidden
in
clumps
of
verdure
from
which
arose
staves
bearing
the
tricolor
and
farther
away
in
a
bluish
haze
a
line
of
tree
tops
marked
the
location
of
a
road
to
the
right
she
could
see
and
the
towering
basilica
at
her
left
above
a
line
of
houses
that
were
becoming
indistinct
the
sun
was
setting
over
in
a
disk
of
flame
and
projecting
upon
the
gray
horizon
shafts
of
light
like
red
pillars
that
seemed
to
support
it
tremblingly
often
a
child
balloon
would
pass
swiftly
across
the
dazzling
expanse
of
sky
they
would
go
down
pass
through
the
gate
walk
along
by
the
lorraine
sausage
shops
the
dealers
in
honeycomb
the
board
the
verdureless
still
unpainted
arbors
where
a
noisy
multitude
of
men
and
women
and
children
were
eating
fried
potatoes
mussels
and
prawns
until
they
reached
the
first
field
the
first
living
grass
on
the
edge
of
the
grass
there
was
a
handcart
laden
with
gingerbread
and
peppermint
lozenges
and
a
woman
selling
hot
cocoa
on
a
table
in
the
furrow
a
strange
country
where
everything
was
mingled
the
smoke
from
the
and
the
evening
vapor
the
noise
of
quoits
on
the
head
of
a
cask
and
the
silence
shed
from
the
sky
the
city
barrier
and
the
idyllic
rural
scene
the
odor
of
manure
and
the
fresh
smell
of
green
wheat
the
great
human
fair
and
nature
germinie
enjoyed
it
however
and
urging
jupillon
to
go
farther
walking
on
the
very
edge
of
the
road
she
would
constantly
step
in
among
the
grain
to
enjoy
the
fresh
cool
sensation
of
the
stalks
against
her
stockings
when
they
returned
she
always
wanted
to
go
upon
the
slope
once
more
the
sun
had
by
that
time
disappeared
and
the
sky
was
gray
below
pink
in
the
centre
and
blue
above
the
horizon
grew
dark
from
green
the
trees
became
a
dark
brown
and
melted
into
the
sky
the
zinc
roofs
of
the
wine
shops
looked
as
if
the
moon
were
shining
upon
them
fires
began
to
appear
in
the
darkness
the
crowd
became
gray
and
the
white
linen
took
on
a
bluish
tinge
little
by
little
everything
would
fade
away
be
blotted
out
lose
its
form
and
color
in
a
dying
remnant
of
colorless
daylight
and
through
the
increasing
darkness
the
voices
of
a
class
whose
life
begins
at
night
and
the
voice
of
the
wine
beginning
to
sing
would
arise
mingled
with
the
din
of
the
rattles
upon
the
slope
the
tops
of
the
tall
grass
waved
to
and
fro
in
the
gentle
breeze
germinie
would
make
up
her
mind
to
go
she
would
wend
her
way
homeward
filled
with
the
influence
of
the
falling
night
abandoning
herself
to
the
uncertain
vision
of
things
passing
the
dark
houses
and
finding
that
everything
along
her
road
had
turned
paler
as
it
were
wearied
by
the
long
walk
over
rough
roads
and
content
to
be
weary
and
slow
and
and
with
a
feeling
of
peace
at
her
heart
at
the
first
lighted
lanterns
on
rue
du
château
she
would
fall
from
her
dream
to
the
pavement
xiii
madame
jupillon
face
always
wore
a
pleased
expression
when
germinie
appeared
when
she
kissed
her
she
was
very
effusive
when
she
spoke
to
her
her
voice
was
caressing
when
she
looked
at
her
her
glance
was
most
amiable
the
huge
creature
kind
heart
seemed
when
with
her
to
abandon
itself
to
the
emotion
the
affection
the
trustfulness
of
a
sort
of
maternal
tenderness
she
took
germinie
into
her
confidence
as
to
her
business
as
to
her
woman
secrets
as
to
the
most
private
affairs
of
her
life
she
seemed
to
open
her
heart
to
her
as
to
a
person
of
her
own
blood
whom
she
desired
to
make
familiar
with
matters
of
interest
to
the
family
when
she
spoke
of
the
future
she
always
referred
to
germinie
as
one
from
whom
she
was
never
to
be
separated
and
who
formed
a
part
of
the
household
often
she
allowed
certain
discreet
mysterious
smiles
to
escape
her
smiles
which
made
it
appear
that
she
saw
all
that
was
going
on
and
was
not
angry
sometimes
too
when
her
son
was
sitting
by
germinie
side
she
would
let
her
eyes
moist
with
a
mother
tears
rest
upon
them
and
would
embrace
them
with
a
glance
that
seemed
to
unite
her
two
children
and
call
down
a
blessing
on
their
heads
without
speaking
without
ever
uttering
a
word
that
could
be
construed
as
an
engagement
without
divulging
her
thoughts
or
binding
herself
in
any
way
and
all
the
time
repeating
that
her
son
was
still
very
young
to
think
of
being
married
she
encouraged
germinie
hopes
and
illusions
by
her
whole
bearing
her
airs
of
secret
indulgence
and
of
complicity
so
far
as
her
heart
was
concerned
by
those
meaning
silences
when
she
seemed
to
open
to
her
a
arms
and
displaying
all
her
talents
in
the
way
of
hypocrisy
drawing
upon
her
hidden
mines
of
sentiment
her
shrewdness
and
the
consummate
intricate
cunning
that
fat
people
possess
the
corpulent
matron
succeeded
in
vanquishing
germinie
last
resistance
by
dint
of
this
tacit
assurance
and
promise
of
marriage
and
she
finally
allowed
the
young
man
ardor
to
extort
from
her
what
she
believed
that
she
was
giving
in
advance
to
the
husband
xiv
as
germinie
was
going
down
the
servant
staircase
one
day
she
heard
adèle
voice
calling
her
over
the
banister
and
telling
her
to
bring
her
two
sous
worth
of
butter
and
ten
of
absinthe
oh
you
can
sit
down
a
minute

know

can
said
adèle
when
she
brought
her
the
absinthe
and
the
butter
i

of
time
to
be
with

old
woman

part

an
antichrist
face
like
hers
so

the
house
without
work
there
is
a
sou
abed
whenever

goes
to
bed

in
bed

day
reading
novels

of
this

she
offered
her
her
glass
of
no

line
for

must
rub
him
the
wrong
way
when
he
had
a
glass
of
blood
after
killing
his
beasts
like
a
madman
and
if
you

with
him
dame
why
then
he
thumps
you
but
what
would
you
have
he
does
that
to
make
him
strong
if
you
could
see
him
thump
himself
on
the
breast

that

kill
an
ox
and
say
a
wall
that
is

a
little
sad
he
adores
that
at
the
theatre
he
does
like
anything
that
does
make
him
cry
look
here
imagine
that
you
writing
to
a
lover
of
your
own
germinie
began
to
write
say
germinie
have
you
heard
madame
taken
a
strange
idea
into
her
head
it
a
funny
thing
about
women
like
her
who
can
hold
their
heads
up
with
the
greatest
of
who
can
have
everything
hobnob
with
kings
if
they
choose
and
there
nothing
to
be
said
when
one
is
like
madame
you
know
when
one
has
such
a
body
as
that
and
then
the
way
they
load
themselves
down
with
finery
with
their
tralala
of
dresses
and
lace
everywhere
and
everything
else
how
do
you
suppose
anyone
can
resist
them
and
if
it
is
a
gentleman
if
it
someone
like
us
you
can
see
how
much
more
all
that
will
catch
him
a
woman
in
velvet
goes
to
his
brain
yes
my
dear
just
fancy
here
madame
gone
daft
on
that
of
a
jupillon
that
all
we
needed
to
make
us
die
of
hunger
here
germinie
with
her
pen
in
the
air
over
the
letter
she
had
begun
looked
up
at
adèle
devouring
her
with
her
eyes
that
brings
you
to
a
standstill
does
it
said
adèle
sipping
her
absinthe
her
face
lighted
up
with
joy
at
sight
of
discomposed
features
oh
it
is
too
absurd
really
but
it
true
my
word
it
true
she
noticed
the
on
the
steps
of
the
shop
the
other
day
coming
home
from
the
races
she
been
there
two
or
three
times
on
the
pretence
of
buying
something
she
probably
have
some
perfumery
sent
from
there
i
bah
it
sickening
is
it
it
their
affair
well
what
about
my
letter
is
it
what
i
told
you
that
makes
you
so
stupid

played
the
prude
i
know
oh

now
i
remember
that
what
it
is
what
was
it
you
said
to
me
about
the
little
one
i
believe
you
did
want
anyone
to
touch
him
idiot
at
a
gesture
of
denial
from
germinie
she
continued
nonsense
nonsense
what
do
i
care
the
kind
of
a
child
that
if
you
blew
his
nose
milk

come
out
thanks

my
style
however
that
your
business

now
for
my
letter
eh
germinie
leaned
over
the
sheet
of
paper
but
she
was
burning
up
with
fever
the
quill
cracked
in
her
nervous
fingers
there
she
said
throwing
it
down
after
a
few
seconds
i
do
know
what
the
matter

have
a
good
laugh
at
her
and
when
the
door
was
closed
adèle
began
to
roar
with
laughter
it
had
cost
her
only
a
little
to
unearth
germinie
secret
xv
so
far
as
young
jupillon
was
concerned
love
was
simply
the
satisfaction
of
a
certain
evil
curiosity
which
sought
in
the
knowledge
and
possession
of
a
woman
the
privilege
and
the
pleasure
of
despising
her
just
emerging
from
boyhood
the
young
man
had
brought
to
his
first
no
other
ardor
no
other
flame
than
the
cold
instincts
of
rascality
awakened
in
boys
by
vile
books
the
confidences
of
their
comrades
conversation
the
first
breath
of
impurity
which
debauches
desire
the
sentiment
with
which
the
young
man
usually
regards
the
woman
who
yields
to
him
the
caresses
the
loving
words
the
affectionate
attentions
with
which
he
envelops
her
nothing
of
all
that
existed
in
jupillon
case
woman
was
to
him
simply
an
obscene
image
and
a
passion
for
a
woman
seemed
to
him
desirable
as
being
prohibited
illicit
vulgar
cynical
and
amusing
an
excellent
opportunity
for
trickery
and
sarcasm
sarcasm
the
low
cowardly
despicable
sarcasm
of
the
dregs
of
the
people
was
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
this
youth
he
was
a
perfect
type
of
those
parisians
who
bear
upon
their
faces
the
mocking
scepticism
of
the
great
city
of
in
which
they
are
born
the
smile
the
shrewdness
and
the
mischief
of
the
parisian
physiognomy
were
always
mocking
and
impertinent
in
him
jupillon
smile
had
the
jovial
expression
imparted
by
a
wicked
mouth
a
mouth
that
was
almost
cruel
at
the
corners
of
the
lips
which
curled
upward
and
were
always
twitching
nervously
his
face
was
pale
with
the
pallor
that
nitric
acid
strong
enough
to
eat
copper
gives
to
the
complexion
and
in
his
sharp
pert
bold
features
were
mingled
bravado
energy
recklessness
intelligence
impudence
and
all
sorts
of
rascally
expressions
softened
at
certain
times
by
a
wheedling
air
his
trade
of
he
had
taken
up
with
that
trade
after
two
or
three
unsuccessful
trials
as
an
apprentice
in
other
crafts
the
habit
of
working
in
the
of
being
on
exhibition
to
the
had
given
to
his
whole
person
the
and
the
dandified
airs
of
a
sitting
in
the
on
the
street
with
his
white
shirt
his
little
black
cravat
la
and
his
pantaloons
he
had
adopted
an
awkward
air
of
nonchalance
the
pretentious
carriage
and
affectations
of
the
workman
who
knows
he
is
being
stared
at
and
various
little
refinements
of
doubtful
taste
the
parting
of
the
hair
in
the
middle
and
brushing
it
down
over
the
temples
the
low
shirt
collars
that
left
the
whole
neck
bare
the
striving
after
the
coquettish
effects
that
properly
belong
to
the
other
sex
gave
him
an
uncertain
appearance
which
was
made
even
more
ambiguous
by
his
beardless
face
marred
only
by
a
faint
suggestion
of
a
moustache
and
his
sexless
features
to
which
passion
and
imparted
all
the
evil
quality
of
a
shrewish
woman
face
but
in
germinie
eyes
all
these
airs
and
this
jupillon
style
were
of
the
highest
distinction
thus
constituted
with
nothing
lovable
about
him
and
incapable
of
a
genuine
attachment
even
through
his
passions
jupillon
was
greatly
embarrassed
and
bored
by
this
adoration
which
became
intoxicated
with
itself
and
waxed
greater
day
by
day
germinie
wearied
him
to
death
she
seemed
to
him
absurd
in
her
humiliation
and
laughable
in
her
devotion
he
was
weary
disgusted
worn
out
with
her
he
had
had
enough
of
her
love
enough
of
her
person
and
he
had
no
hesitation
about
cutting
loose
from
her
without
charity
or
pity
he
ran
away
from
her
he
failed
to
keep
the
appointments
she
made
he
pretended
that
he
was
kept
away
by
accident
by
errands
to
be
done
by
a
pressure
of
work
at
night
she
waited
for
him
and
he
did
not
come
she
supposed
that
he
was
detained
by
business
in
fact
he
was
at
some
low
billiard
hall
or
at
some
ball
at
the
barrier
xvi
there
was
a
ball
at
the
one
thursday
the
dancing
was
in
full
blast
the
had
the
ordinary
appearance
of
modern
places
of
amusement
for
the
people
it
was
brilliant
with
false
richness
and
tawdry
splendor
there
were
paintings
there
and
tables
at
which
wine
was
sold
gilded
chandeliers
and
glasses
that
held
a
quartern
of
brandy
velvet
hangings
and
wooden
benches
the
shabbiness
and
rusticity
of
an
with
the
decorations
of
a
cardboard
palace
garnet
velvet
lambrequins
with
a
fringe
of
gold
lace
hung
at
the
windows
and
were
economically
copied
in
paint
beneath
the
mirrors
which
were
lighted
by
candelabra
on
the
walls
in
large
white
panels
pastoral
scenes
by
boucher
surrounded
with
painted
frames
alternated
with
which
were
much
astonished
to
find
themselves
in
such
a
place
and
above
the
windows
and
doors
dropsical
loves
gamboled
among
five
roses
protruding
from
a
pomade
jar
of
the
sort
used
by
suburban
square
pillars
embellished
with
meagre
arabesques
supported
the
ceiling
in
the
centre
of
the
hall
where
there
was
a
small
octagonal
stand
containing
the
orchestra
an
oaken
rail
waist
high
which
served
as
a
back
to
a
cheap
red
bench
enclosed
the
dancers
and
against
this
rail
on
the
outside
were
tables
painted
green
and
two
rows
of
benches
surrounding
the
dance
with
a
café
in
the
dancers
enclosure
beneath
the
fierce
glare
and
the
intense
heat
of
the
gas
were
women
of
all
sorts
dressed
in
dark
worn
rumpled
woolens
women
in
black
tulle
caps
women
in
black
women
in
worn
shiny
at
the
seams
women
in
fur
tippets
bought
of
dealers
and
in
shops
in
dark
alleys
and
in
the
whole
assemblage
not
one
of
the
youthful
faces
was
set
off
by
a
collar
not
a
glimpse
of
a
white
skirt
could
be
seen
among
the
whirling
dancers
not
a
glimmer
of
white
about
these
women
who
were
all
dressed
in
gloomy
colors
the
colors
of
want
to
the
ends
of
their
unpolished
shoes
this
absence
of
linen
gave
to
the
ball
an
aspect
as
of
poverty
in
mourning
it
imparted
to
all
the
faces
a
touch
of
gloom
and
uncleanness
of
lifelessness
and
earthiness
a
vaguely
forbidding
aspect
in
which
there
was
a
suggestion
of
the
and
the
an
old
woman
in
a
wig
with
the
hair
parted
at
the
side
passed
in
front
of
the
tables
with
a
basket
filled
with
pieces
of
savoy
cake
and
red
apples
from
time
to
time
the
dance
in
its
twisting
and
turning
disclosed
a
soiled
stocking
the
typical
jewish
features
of
a
street
pedlar
of
sponges
red
fingers
protruding
from
black
mitts
a
swarthy
moustached
face
an
soiled
with
the
mud
of
night
before
last
a
stiff
and
crumpled
of
flowered
calico
the
finery
of
some
kept
mistress
the
men
wore
small
soft
caps
pulled
down
over
their
ears
and
woolen
comforters
untied
and
hanging
down
their
backs
they
invited
the
women
to
dance
by
pulling
them
by
the
cap
ribbons
that
fluttered
behind
them
some
few
in
hats
and
frockcoats
and
colored
shirts
had
an
insolent
air
of
domesticity
and
a
swagger
befitting
grooms
in
some
great
family
everybody
was
jumping
and
bustling
about
the
women
frisked
and
capered
and
gamboled
excited
and
stimulated
by
the
spur
of
bestial
pleasure
and
in
the
evolutions
of
the
one
could
hear
brothel
addresses
given
du
germinie
entered
the
hall
just
at
the
conclusion
of
a
quadrille
to
the
air
of
casquette
du
père
in
which
the
cymbals
the
and
the
drum
had
infected
the
dancers
with
the
giddiness
and
madness
of
their
uproar
at
a
glance
she
embraced
the
whole
room
all
the
men
leading
their
partners
back
to
the
places
marked
by
their
caps
she
had
been
misled
was
not
there
she
could
not
see
him
however
she
waited
she
entered
the
dancers
enclosure
and
sat
down
on
the
end
of
a
bench
trying
not
to
seem
too
much
embarrassed
from
their
linen
caps
she
judged
that
the
women
seated
in
line
beside
her
were
servants
like
herself
comrades
of
her
own
class
alarmed
her
less
than
the
little
hussies
with
their
hair
in
nets
and
their
hands
in
the
pockets
of
their
who
strolled
humming
about
the
room
but
soon
she
aroused
hostile
attention
even
on
her
bench
her
hat
only
about
a
dozen
women
at
the
ball
wore
hats
her
flounced
skirt
the
white
hem
of
which
could
be
seen
under
her
dress
the
gold
brooch
that
secured
her
shawl
awakened
malevolent
curiosity
all
about
her
glances
and
smiles
were
bestowed
upon
her
that
boded
her
no
good
all
the
women
seemed
to
be
asking
one
another
where
this
new
arrival
had
come
from
and
to
be
saying
to
one
another
that
she
would
take
their
lovers
from
them
young
women
who
were
walking
about
the
hall
in
pairs
with
their
arms
about
one
another
waists
as
if
for
a
waltz
made
her
lower
her
eyes
as
they
passed
in
front
of
her
and
then
went
on
with
a
contemptuous
shrug
turning
their
heads
to
look
back
at
her
she
changed
her
place
she
was
met
with
the
same
smiles
the
same
whispering
the
same
hostility
she
went
to
the
further
end
of
the
hall
all
the
women
looked
after
her
she
felt
as
if
she
were
enveloped
in
malicious
envious
glances
from
the
hem
of
her
dress
to
the
flowers
on
her
hat
her
face
flushed
at
times
she
feared
that
she
should
weep
she
longed
to
leave
the
place
but
she
lacked
courage
to
walk
the
length
of
the
hall
all
alone
she
began
mechanically
to
watch
an
old
woman
who
was
slowly
making
the
circuit
of
the
hall
with
a
noiseless
step
like
a
bird
of
night
flying
in
a
circle
a
black
hat
of
the
hue
of
charred
paper
confined
her
of
grizzled
hair
from
her
square
high
masculine
shoulders
hung
a
scotch
tartan
when
she
reached
the
door
she
cast
a
last
glance
about
the
hall
that
embraced
everyone
therein
with
the
eye
of
a
vulture
seeking
in
vain
for
food
suddenly
there
was
an
outcry
a
police
officer
was
ejecting
a
diminutive
youth
who
tried
to
bite
his
hands
and
clung
to
the
tables
against
which
as
he
was
dragged
along
he
struck
with
a
noise
like
breaking
furniture
as
germinie
turned
her
head
she
spied
jupillon
he
was
sitting
between
two
women
at
a
green
table
in
a
smoking
one
of
the
two
was
a
tall
blonde
with
a
small
quantity
of
frizzled
flaxen
hair
a
flat
stupid
face
and
round
eyes
a
red
flannel
chemise
lay
in
folds
on
her
back
and
she
had
both
hands
in
the
pockets
of
a
black
apron
which
she
was
flapping
up
and
down
on
her
dark
red
skirt
the
other
a
short
dark
creature
whose
face
was
still
red
from
having
been
scrubbed
with
soap
was
enveloped
as
to
her
head
with
the
coquetry
of
a
fishwoman
in
a
white
knitted
hood
with
a
blue
border
jupillon
had
recognized
germinie
when
he
saw
her
rise
and
approach
him
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
his
face
he
whispered
something
to
the
woman
in
the
hood
rested
his
elbows
defiantly
on
the
table
and
waited
hallo
you
here
he
exclaimed
when
germinie
stood
before
him
erect
motionless
and
mute
this
is
a
surprise
waiter
another
bowl
and
emptying
the
bowl
of
sweetened
wine
into
the
two
women
glasses
he
continued
come
do
make
up
faces
sit
down
there
and
as
germinie
did
not
budge
go
on
these
ladies
are
friends
of
mine
ask
them
mélie
said
the
woman
in
the
hood
to
the
other
woman
in
a
voice
like
a
diseased
crow
do
you
see
she
monsieur
mother
make
room
for
the
lady
if
she
like
to
drink
with
us
germinie
cast
a
murderous
glance
at
the
woman
well
what
the
matter
the
woman
continued
that
do
suit
you
madame
eh
excuse
me
you
ought
to
have
told
me
beforehand
how
old
do
you
suppose
she
is
mélie
eh
you
select
young
ones
my
boy
you
do
put
yourself
out
jupillon
smiled
internally
and
simpered
and
sneered
externally
his
whole
manner
displayed
the
cowardly
delight
that
persons
take
in
watching
the
suffering
of
those
who
suffer
because
of
loving
them
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
to
you
not
here
outside
said
germinie
much
joy
to
you
coming
mélie
said
the
woman
in
the
hood
lighting
the
stub
of
a
cigar
that
jupillon
had
left
on
the
table
beside
a
piece
of
lemon
what
do
you
want
said
jupillon
impressed
in
spite
of
himself
by
germinie
tone
come
and
she
walked
on
ahead
of
him
as
she
passed
the
people
crowded
about
her
laughing
she
heard
voices
broken
sentences
subdued
hooting
xvii
jupillon
promised
germinie
not
to
go
to
the
ball
again
but
he
was
just
beginning
to
make
a
name
for
himself
at
la
brididi
among
the
low
haunts
near
the
barrier
the
the
and
the
he
had
become
one
of
the
dancers
who
make
the
guests
leave
their
seats
who
keep
a
whole
roomful
of
people
hanging
on
the
soles
of
their
boots
as
they
toss
them
two
inches
above
their
heads
and
whom
the
fair
dancers
of
the
locality
invite
to
dance
with
them
and
sometimes
pay
for
their
refreshment
to
that
end
the
ball
to
him
was
not
a
ball
simply
it
was
a
stage
an
audience
popularity
applause
the
flattering
murmur
of
his
name
among
the
groups
of
people
an
ovation
accorded
to
saltatory
glory
in
the
glare
of
the
reverberators
on
sunday
he
did
not
go
to
the
but
on
the
following
thursday
he
went
there
again
and
germinie
seeing
plainly
enough
that
she
could
not
prevent
him
from
going
decided
to
follow
him
and
to
stay
there
as
long
as
he
did
sitting
at
a
table
in
the
background
in
the
least
brilliantly
lighted
corner
of
the
she
would
follow
him
eagerly
with
her
eyes
throughout
the
whole
and
when
it
was
at
an
end
if
he
held
back
she
would
go
and
seize
him
take
him
almost
by
force
from
the
hands
and
caresses
of
the
women
who
persisted
in
trying
to
pull
him
back
to
detain
him
by
wicked
wiles
as
they
soon
came
to
know
her
the
insulting
remarks
in
her
neighborhood
ceased
to
be
vague
and
indistinct
and
muttered
under
the
breath
as
at
the
first
ball
the
words
were
thrown
in
her
face
the
laughter
spoke
aloud
she
was
obliged
to
pass
her
three
hours
amid
a
chorus
of
derision
that
pointed
its
finger
at
her
called
her
by
name
and
cast
her
age
in
her
face
at
every
turn
she
was
forced
to
submit
to
the
appellation
of
woman
which
the
young
hussies
spat
at
her
over
their
shoulders
as
they
passed
but
they
did
at
least
look
at
her
often
however
dancing
women
invited
by
jupillon
to
drink
and
brought
by
him
to
the
table
at
which
germinie
was
would
sit
with
their
elbows
on
the
table
and
their
cheeks
resting
on
their
hands
drinking
the
bowl
of
mulled
wine
for
which
she
paid
apparently
unaware
that
there
was
another
woman
there
crowding
into
her
place
as
if
it
were
unoccupied
and
making
no
reply
when
she
spoke
to
them
germinie
could
have
killed
these
creatures
whom
jupillon
forced
her
to
entertain
and
who
despised
her
so
utterly
that
they
did
not
even
notice
her
presence
the
time
arrived
when
having
endured
all
she
could
endure
and
being
sickened
by
the
humiliation
she
was
forced
to
swallow
she
conceived
the
idea
of
dancing
herself
she
saw
no
other
way
to
avoid
leaving
her
lover
to
others
to
keep
him
by
her
all
the
evening
and
perhaps
to
bind
him
more
closely
to
her
by
her
success
if
she
had
any
chance
of
succeeding
throughout
a
whole
month
she
worked
in
secret
to
learn
to
dance
she
rehearsed
the
figures
and
the
steps
she
forced
her
body
into
unnatural
attitudes
she
wore
herself
out
trying
to
master
the
contortions
and
the
manipulations
of
the
skirt
that
she
saw
were
applauded
at
the
end
of
the
month
she
made
the
venture
but
everything
tended
to
disconcert
her
and
added
to
her
awkwardness
the
hostility
that
she
could
feel
in
the
atmosphere
the
smiles
of
astonishment
and
pity
that
played
about
the
lips
of
the
spectators
when
she
took
her
place
in
the
dancers
enclosure
she
was
so
absurd
and
so
laughed
at
that
she
had
not
the
courage
to
make
a
second
attempt
she
buried
herself
gloomily
in
her
dark
corner
only
leaving
it
to
hunt
up
jupillon
and
carry
him
off
with
the
mute
violence
of
a
wife
dragging
her
husband
out
of
the
wineshop
and
leading
him
home
by
the
arm
it
was
soon
rumored
in
the
street
that
germinie
went
to
these
balls
that
she
never
missed
one
of
them
the
fruit
woman
at
whose
shop
adèle
had
already
held
forth
sent
her
son
to
see
he
returned
with
a
confirmation
of
the
rumor
and
told
of
all
the
petty
annoyances
to
which
germinie
was
subjected
but
which
did
not
keep
her
from
returning
thereafter
there
was
no
more
doubt
in
the
quarter
as
to
the
relations
between
mademoiselle
servant
and
jupillon
relations
which
some
charitable
souls
had
hitherto
persisted
in
denying
the
scandal
burst
out
and
in
a
week
the
poor
girl
berated
by
all
the
slanderous
tongues
in
the
quarter
baptized
and
saluted
by
the
vilest
names
in
the
language
of
the
streets
fell
at
a
blow
from
the
most
emphatically
expressed
esteem
to
the
most
brutally
advertised
contempt
thus
far
her
pride
and
it
was
very
great
had
procured
for
her
the
respect
and
consideration
which
is
bestowed
in
the
lorette
quarters
upon
a
servant
who
honestly
serves
a
virtuous
mistress
she
had
become
accustomed
to
respect
and
deference
and
attention
she
stood
apart
from
her
comrades
her
unassailable
probity
her
conduct
as
to
which
not
a
word
could
be
said
her
confidential
relations
with
mademoiselle
which
caused
her
mistress
honorable
character
to
be
reflected
upon
her
led
the
shopkeeper
to
treat
her
on
a
different
footing
from
the
other
maids
they
addressed
her
cap
in
hand
they
always
called
her
they
hurried
to
wait
upon
her
they
offered
her
the
only
chair
in
the
shop
when
she
had
to
wait
even
when
she
contended
over
prices
they
were
still
polite
with
her
and
never
called
her
jests
that
were
somewhat
too
broad
were
cut
short
when
she
appeared
she
was
invited
to
the
great
banquets
to
family
parties
and
consulted
upon
business
matters
everything
changed
as
soon
as
her
relations
with
jupillon
and
her
assiduous
attendance
at
the
were
known
the
quarter
took
its
revenge
for
having
respected
her
the
maids
in
the
house
accosted
her
as
one
of
their
own
kind
one
whose
lover
was
at
mazas
called
her
my
dear
the
men
accosted
her
familiarly
and
with
all
the
intimacy
of
thee
and
thou
in
glance
and
gesture
and
tone
and
touch
the
very
children
on
the
sidewalk
who
were
formerly
trained
to
courtesy
politely
to
her
ran
away
from
her
as
from
a
person
of
whom
they
had
been
told
to
be
afraid
she
felt
that
she
was
being
maligned
behind
her
back
handed
over
to
the
devil
she
could
not
take
a
step
without
walking
through
scorn
and
receiving
a
blow
from
her
shame
upon
the
cheek
it
was
a
horrible
affliction
to
her
she
suffered
as
if
her
honor
were
being
torn
from
her
shred
by
shred
and
dragged
in
the
gutter
but
the
more
she
suffered
the
closer
she
pressed
her
love
to
her
heart
and
clung
to
him
she
bore
him
no
she
uttered
no
word
of
reproach
to
him
she
attached
herself
to
him
by
all
the
tears
he
caused
her
pride
to
shed
and
now
in
the
street
through
which
she
passed
but
a
short
time
ago
proudly
and
with
head
erect
she
could
be
seen
bent
double
as
if
crouching
over
her
fault
hurrying
furtively
along
with
oblique
glances
dreading
to
be
recognized
quickening
her
pace
in
front
of
the
shops
that
swept
their
slanders
out
upon
her
heels
xviii
jupillon
was
constantly
complaining
that
he
was
tired
of
working
for
others
that
he
could
not
set
up
for
himself
that
he
could
not
find
fifteen
or
eighteen
hundred
francs
in
his
mother
purse
he
needed
no
more
than
that
he
said
to
hire
a
couple
of
rooms
on
the
ground
floor
and
set
up
as
a
glover
in
a
small
way
indeed
he
was
already
dreaming
of
what
he
might
do
and
laying
out
his
plans
he
would
open
a
shop
in
the
quarter
an
excellent
quarter
for
his
business
as
it
was
full
of
purchasers
and
of
makers
of
wretched
gloves
at
five
francs
he
would
soon
add
a
line
of
perfumery
and
cravats
to
his
gloves
and
then
when
he
had
made
a
tidy
sum
he
would
sell
out
and
take
a
fine
shop
on
rue
de
richelieu
whenever
he
mentioned
the
subject
germinie
asked
him
innumerable
questions
she
wanted
to
know
everything
that
was
necessary
to
start
in
business
she
made
him
tell
her
the
names
of
the
tools
and
appurtenances
give
her
an
idea
of
their
prices
and
where
they
could
be
bought
she
questioned
him
as
to
his
trade
and
the
details
of
his
work
so
inquisitively
and
persistently
that
jupillon
lost
his
patience
at
last
and
said
to
her
what
all
this
to
you
the
work
sickens
me
enough
now
do
mention
it
to
me
one
sunday
she
walked
toward
montmartre
with
him
instead
of
taking
rue
frochot
she
turned
into
rue
pigalle
why
this
ai
the
way
is
it
said
jupillon
i
know
what
i
about
said
she
come
on
she
had
taken
his
arm
and
she
walked
on
turning
her
head
slightly
away
from
him
so
that
he
could
not
see
what
was
taking
place
on
her
face
half
way
along
rue
fontaine
she
halted
abruptly
in
front
of
two
windows
on
the
ground
floor
of
a
house
and
said
to
him
look
she
was
trembling
with
joy
jupillon
looked
he
saw
between
the
two
windows
on
a
glistening
copper
plate
de
jupillon
he
saw
white
curtains
at
the
first
window
through
the
glass
in
the
other
he
saw
and
boxes
and
near
the
window
the
little
glover
cutting
board
with
the
great
shears
the
jar
for
clippings
and
the
knife
to
make
holes
in
the
skins
in
order
to
stretch
them
the
concierge
has
your
key
she
said
they
entered
the
first
room
the
shop
she
at
once
set
about
showing
him
everything
she
opened
the
boxes
and
laughed
then
she
pushed
open
the
door
into
the
other
room
there
you
wo
be
stifled
there
as
you
are
in
the
loft
at
your
mother
do
you
like
it
oh
it
is
handsome
but
it
clean
i
have
liked
to
give
you
mahogany
do
you
like
that
little
rug
by
the
bed
and
the
paper
i
did
think
of
that
she
put
a
receipt
for
the
rent
in
his
hand
see
this
is
for
six
months
dame
you
must
go
to
work
right
off
and
earn
some
money
the
few
sous
i
had
laid
by
are
all
gone
oh
let
me
sit
down
you
look
so
pleased
it
gives
me
a
turn
it
makes
my
head
spin
i
have
any
legs
and
she
sank
into
a
chair
jupillon
stooped
over
her
to
kiss
her
ah
yes
they
not
there
any
longer
she
said
seeing
that
he
was
looking
for
her
earrings
they
gone
like
my
rings
d
see
all
gone
and
she
showed
him
her
hands
bare
of
the
paltry
gems
she
had
worked
so
long
to
buy
they
all
went
for
the
you
see
but
it
all
horsehair
as
jupillon
stood
in
front
of
her
with
an
embarrassed
air
as
if
he
were
trying
to
find
words
with
which
to
thank
her
she
continued
why
you
a
funny
fellow
what
the
matter
with
you
ah
it
on
that
account
is
it
and
she
pointed
to
the
bedroom
you
a
stupid
i
love
you
do
i
well
then
germinie
said
the
words
simply
as
the
heart
says
sublime
things
xix
she
became
at
first
she
doubted
she
dared
not
believe
it
but
when
she
was
certain
of
the
fact
she
was
filled
with
immeasurable
joy
a
joy
that
overflowed
her
heart
her
happiness
was
so
great
and
so
overpowering
that
it
stifled
at
a
single
stroke
the
anguish
the
fear
the
inward
trembling
that
ordinarily
disturb
the
maternity
of
unmarried
women
and
poisons
their
anticipations
of
childbirth
the
divine
hope
that
lives
and
moves
within
them
the
thought
of
the
scandal
caused
by
the
discovery
of
her
of
the
outcry
in
the
quarter
the
idea
of
the
abominable
thing
that
had
always
made
her
think
of
suicide
dishonor
even
the
fear
of
being
detected
by
mademoiselle
and
dismissed
by
her
nothing
of
all
this
could
cast
a
shadow
on
her
felicity
the
child
that
she
expected
allowed
her
to
see
nothing
but
it
as
if
she
had
it
already
in
her
arms
before
her
and
hardly
attempting
to
conceal
her
condition
she
bore
her
woman
shame
almost
proudly
through
the
streets
exulting
and
radiant
in
the
thought
that
she
was
to
be
a
mother
she
was
unhappy
only
because
she
had
spent
all
her
savings
and
was
not
only
without
money
but
had
been
paid
several
months
wages
in
advance
by
her
mistress
she
bitterly
deplored
having
to
receive
her
child
in
a
poor
way
often
as
she
passed
through
rue
she
would
stop
in
front
of
a
in
whose
windows
were
displayed
stores
of
rich
she
would
devour
with
her
eyes
the
pretty
dainty
flowered
garments
the
piqué
bibs
the
long
dresses
trimmed
with
english
embroidery
the
whole
cherub
costume
a
terrible
longing
the
longing
of
a
pregnant
woman
to
break
the
glass
and
steal
it
all
would
come
upon
her
the
clerks
standing
behind
the
display
framework
became
accustomed
to
seeing
her
take
up
her
station
there
and
would
laughingly
point
her
out
to
one
another
again
at
intervals
amid
the
happiness
that
overflowed
her
heart
amid
the
ecstasy
that
exalted
her
being
another
disturbing
thought
passed
through
her
mind
she
would
ask
herself
how
the
father
would
welcome
his
child
two
or
three
times
she
had
attempted
to
tell
him
of
her
condition
but
had
not
dared
at
last
one
day
seeing
that
his
face
wore
the
expression
she
had
awaited
so
long
as
a
preliminary
to
telling
him
everything
an
expression
in
which
there
was
a
touch
of
affection
she
confessed
to
him
blushing
hotly
and
as
if
asking
his
forgiveness
what
it
was
that
made
her
so
happy
that
all
imagination
said
jupillon
and
when
she
had
assured
him
that
it
was
not
imagination
and
that
she
was
positively
five
months
advanced
in
pregnancy
just
my
luck
the
young
man
rejoined
thanks
and
he
swore
would
you
mind
telling
me
who
going
to
feed
the
sparrow
oh
never
you
fear
it
suffer
i
look
out
for
that
and
then
it
be
so
pretty
do
be
afraid
no
one
shall
know
anything
about
it
i
fix
myself
up
see
the
last
part
of
the
time
i
walk
like
this
with
my
head
back
i
wo
wear
any
petticoats
and
i
pull
myself
in
you
see
nobody
shall
notice
anything
i
tell
you
just
think
of
it
a
little
child
of
our
own
well
as
long
as
it
so
it
so
eh
said
the
young
man
say
ventured
germinie
timidly
suppose
you
should
tell
your
mother
ma
oh
no
i
rather
think
not
you
must
lie
in
first
after
that
take
the
brat
to
the
house
it
will
give
her
a
start
and
perhaps
consent
without
meaning
to
xx
twelfth
night
arrived
it
was
the
day
on
which
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
gave
a
grand
regularly
every
year
she
invited
all
the
children
of
her
own
family
or
her
old
friends
families
great
and
small
the
small
suite
would
hardly
hold
them
all
they
were
obliged
to
put
part
of
the
furniture
on
the
landing
and
a
table
was
set
in
each
of
the
two
rooms
which
formed
mademoiselle
whole
suite
for
the
children
that
day
was
a
great
festival
to
which
they
looked
forward
for
a
week
they
came
running
up
the
stairway
behind
the
men
at
table
they
ate
too
much
without
being
scolded
at
night
they
were
unwilling
to
go
to
bed
they
climbed
on
the
chairs
and
made
a
racket
that
always
gave
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
a
sick
headache
the
next
day
but
she
bore
them
no
grudge
therefor
she
had
had
the
full
enjoyment
of
a
genuine
grandmother
fête
in
listening
to
them
looking
at
them
tying
around
their
necks
the
white
napkins
that
made
them
look
so
rosy
and
not
for
anything
in
the
world
would
she
have
failed
to
give
this
which
filled
her
old
maid
apartments
with
the
little
imps
of
satan
and
brought
thither
in
a
single
day
an
atmosphere
of
activity
and
youth
and
laughter
that
lasted
a
whole
year
germinie
was
preparing
the
dinner
she
was
whipping
cream
in
an
earthen
bowl
on
her
knees
when
suddenly
she
felt
the
first
pains
she
looked
at
her
face
in
the
bit
of
a
broken
mirror
that
she
had
above
her
kitchen
dresser
and
saw
that
she
was
pale
she
went
down
to
adèle
give
me
your
mistress
rouge
she
said
and
she
put
some
on
her
cheeks
then
she
went
up
again
and
refusing
to
listen
to
the
voice
of
her
suffering
finished
cooking
the
dinner
it
had
to
be
served
and
she
served
it
at
dessert
she
leaned
against
the
furniture
and
grasped
the
backs
of
chairs
as
she
passed
the
plates
hiding
her
torture
with
the
ghastly
set
smile
of
people
whose
entrails
are
writhing
how
this
are
you
sick
said
her
mistress
looking
sharply
at
her

line

her
mistress

told
her
that
she
was
too
ill
to
work
that
she
had
gone
to
the
hospital
but
would
not
tell
her

francs

that
for
the
midwife

hard
luck

and
he
offered
his
arm
to
assist
her
i
going
to
have
hard
work
to
get
all
the
same
he
had
opened
the
carriage
door
where
do
you
want
him
to
take
you
to
la
bourbe
said
germinie
and
she
slipped
the
forty
francs
into
his
hand
no
no
said
jupillon
oh
nonsense
there
or
somewhere
else
besides
i
have
seven
francs
left
the
cab
started
away
jupillon
stood
for
a
moment
motionless
on
the
sidewalk
looking
at
the
two
napoleons
in
his
hand
then
he
ran
after
the
cab
stopped
it
and
said
to
germinie
through
the
window
at
least
i
can
go
with
you
no
i
am
in
too
much
pain
i
rather
be
alone
she
replied
writhing
on
the
cushions
of
the
cab
after
an
endless
half
hour
the
cab
stopped
on
rue
de
in
front
of
a
black
door
surmounted
by
a
violet
lantern
which
announced
to
such
medical
students
as
happened
to
pass
through
the
street
that
there
was
that
night
and
at
that
moment
the
curious
and
interesting
spectacle
of
a
difficult
labor
in
progress
at
la
maternité
the
driver
descended
from
his
box
and
rang
the
concierge
assisted
by
a
female
attendant
took
germinie
arms
and
led
her
to
one
of
the
four
beds
in
the
once
in
bed
her
pains
became
somewhat
less
excruciating
she
looked
about
her
saw
the
other
beds
all
empty
and
at
the
end
of
the
immense
room
a
huge
fireplace
in
which
a
bright
fire
was
blazing
and
in
front
of
which
hanging
upon
iron
bars
sheets
and
cloths
and
bandages
were
drying
half
an
hour
later
germinie
gave
birth
to
a
little
girl
her
bed
was
moved
into
another
room
she
had
been
there
several
hours
lost
in
the
blissful
weakness
which
follows
the
frightful
agony
of
childbirth
happy
and
amazed
to
find
that
she
was
still
alive
swimming
in
a
sea
of
blessed
relief
and
deeply
penetrated
with
the
joy
of
having
created
suddenly
a
loud
cry
i
am
dying
caused
her
to
turn
her
eyes
in
the
direction
from
which
it
came
she
saw
one
of
her
neighbors
throw
her
arms
around
the
neck
of
one
of
the
assistant
nurses
fall
back
almost
instantly
move
a
moment
under
the
clothes
then
lie
perfectly
still
almost
at
the
same
instant
another
shriek
arose
from
a
bed
on
the
other
side
a
horrible
piercing
terrified
shriek
as
of
one
who
sees
death
approaching
it
was
a
woman
calling
the
young
assistant
with
desperate
gestures
the
assistant
ran
to
her
leaned
over
her
and
fell
in
a
dead
faint
upon
the
floor
thereupon
silence
reigned
once
more
but
between
the
two
dead
bodies
and
the
assistant
whom
the
cold
floor
did
not
restore
to
consciousness
for
more
than
an
hour
germinie
and
the
other
women
who
were
still
alive
in
the
room
lay
quiet
not
daring
even
to
ring
the
bell
that
hung
beside
each
bed
to
call
for
help
thereafter
la
maternité
was
the
scene
of
one
of
those
terrible
puerperal
epidemics
which
breathe
death
upon
human
fecundity
of
one
of
those
cases
of
atmospheric
poisoning
which
empty
in
a
twinkling
and
by
whole
rows
the
beds
of
women
lately
delivered
and
which
once
caused
the
closing
of
la
clinique
they
believed
that
it
was
a
visitation
of
the
plague
a
plague
that
turns
the
face
black
in
a
few
hours
carries
all
before
it
and
snatches
up
the
youngest
and
the
strongest
a
plague
that
issues
from
the
cradle
the
black
plague
of
mothers
all
about
germinie
at
all
hours
especially
at
night
women
were
dying
such
deaths
as
the
causes
deaths
that
seemed
to
violate
all
nature
laws
agonizing
deaths
accompanied
by
wild
shrieks
and
troubled
by
hallucinations
and
delirium
death
agonies
that
compelled
the
application
of
the
death
agonies
that
caused
the
victims
to
leap
suddenly
from
their
beds
carrying
the
clothes
with
them
and
causing
the
whole
room
to
shudder
at
the
thought
that
they
were
dead
bodies
from
the
amphitheatre
life
departed
as
if
it
were
torn
from
the
body
the
very
disease
assumed
a
ghastly
shape
and
monstrous
aspect
the
bedclothes
were
lifted
in
the
centre
by
the
swelling
caused
by
peritonitis
producing
a
vague
horrifying
effect
in
the
lamplight
for
five
days
germinie
lying
swathed
and
bandaged
in
her
bed
closing
her
eyes
and
ears
as
best
she
could
had
the
strength
to
combat
all
these
horrors
and
yielded
to
them
only
at
long
intervals
she
was
determined
to
live
and
she
clung
to
her
strength
by
thinking
of
her
child
and
of
mademoiselle
but
on
the
sixth
day
her
energy
was
exhausted
her
courage
forsook
her
a
cold
wave
flowed
into
her
heart
she
said
to
herself
that
it
was
all
over
the
hand
that
death
lays
upon
one
shoulder
the
presentiment
of
death
was
already
touching
her
she
felt
the
first
breath
of
the
epidemic
the
belief
that
she
was
its
destined
victim
and
the
impression
that
she
was
already
by
it
although
unresigned
she
succumbed
her
life
vanquished
beforehand
hardly
made
an
effort
to
struggle
at
that
crisis
a
head
bent
over
her
pillow
like
a
ray
of
light
it
was
the
head
of
the
youngest
of
the
a
fair
head
with
long
golden
locks
and
blue
eyes
so
soft
and
sweet
that
the
dying
saw
heaven
opening
its
gates
therein
when
they
saw
her
delirious
women
said
look
the
blessed
virgin
my
child
she
said
to
germinie
you
must
ask
for
your
discharge
at
once
you
must
go
away
from
here
you
must
dress
warmly
you
must
wrap
up
well
as
soon
as
you
at
home
and
in
bed
you
must
take
a
hot
draught
of
something
or
other
you
must
try
to
take
a
sweat
then
it
wo
do
you
any
harm
but
go
away
from
here
it
would
be
healthy
for
you
here
she
said
glancing
around
at
the
beds
do
say
that
i
told
you
to
go
you
would
get
me
discharged
if
you
should
xxi
germinie
recovered
in
a
few
days
the
joy
and
pride
of
having
given
birth
to
a
tiny
creature
in
whom
her
flesh
was
mingled
with
the
flesh
of
the
man
she
loved
the
bliss
of
being
a
mother
saved
her
from
the
natural
results
of
a
confinement
in
which
she
did
not
receive
proper
care
she
was
restored
to
health
and
had
an
apparent
pleasure
in
living
that
her
mistress
had
never
before
seen
her
manifest
every
sunday
no
matter
what
the
weather
might
be
she
left
the
house
about
eleven
mademoiselle
believed
that
she
went
to
see
a
friend
in
the
country
and
was
delighted
that
her
maid
derived
so
much
benefit
from
these
days
passed
in
the
open
air
germinie
would
capture
jupillon
who
allowed
himself
to
be
taken
in
tow
without
too
much
resistance
and
they
would
start
for
pommeuse
where
the
child
was
and
where
a
good
breakfast
ordered
by
the
mother
awaited
them
once
in
the
carriage
on
the
mulhouse
railway
germinie
would
not
speak
or
reply
when
spoken
to
she
would
lean
out
of
the
window
and
all
her
thoughts
seemed
to
be
upon
what
lay
before
her
she
gazed
as
if
her
longing
were
striving
to
outrun
the
steam
the
train
would
hardly
have
stopped
before
she
had
leaped
out
tossed
her
ticket
to
the
and
started
at
a
run
on
the
pommeuse
road
leaving
jupillon
behind
she
drew
nearer
and
nearer
she
could
see
the
house
she
was
there
yes
there
was
the
child
she
would
pounce
upon
her
snatch
her
from
the
nurse
arms
with
jealous
hands
a
mother
hands
hug
her
strain
her
to
her
heart
kiss
her
devour
her
with
kisses
and
looks
and
smiles
she
would
gaze
admiringly
at
her
for
an
instant
and
then
distraught
with
joy
mad
with
love
would
cover
her
with
kisses
to
the
tips
of
her
little
bare
toes
breakfast
would
be
served
she
would
sit
at
the
table
with
the
child
on
her
knees
and
eat
nothing
she
had
kissed
her
so
much
that
she
had
not
yet
looked
at
her
and
she
would
begin
to
seek
out
points
of
resemblance
to
themselves
in
the
little
one
one
feature
was
his
another
hers
she
has
your
nose
and
my
eyes
her
hair
will
be
like
yours
in
time
it
will
curl
look
those
are
your
hands
she
is
all
you
and
for
hours
she
would
continue
the
inexhaustible
and
charming
prattle
of
a
woman
who
is
determined
to
give
a
man
his
share
of
their
daughter
jupillon
submitted
to
it
all
with
reasonably
good
grace
thanks
to
divers
cigars
germinie
always
produced
from
her
pocket
and
gave
to
him
one
by
one
then
he
had
found
a
means
of
diversion
the
morin
flowed
at
the
foot
of
the
garden
jupillon
was
a
true
parisian
he
loved
to
fish
with
a
pole
and
line
and
when
summer
came
they
stayed
there
all
day
at
the
foot
of
the
garden
on
the
bank
of
the
stream
jupillon
on
a
laundry
board
resting
on
two
stakes
pole
in
hand
and
germinie
sitting
with
the
child
in
her
skirts
under
the
medlar
tree
that
overhung
the
stream
on
pleasant
days
the
sun
poured
down
upon
the
broad
sparkling
current
from
which
beams
of
light
arose
as
from
a
mirror
it
was
like
a
display
of
fireworks
from
the
sky
and
the
stream
amid
which
germinie
would
hold
the
little
girl
upon
her
feet
and
let
her
trample
upon
her
with
her
little
bare
pink
legs
in
her
short
baby
dress
her
skin
shimmering
in
spots
in
the
sunlight
her
flesh
mottled
with
sunbeams
like
the
flesh
of
angels
germinie
had
seen
in
pictures
she
had
a
divinely
sweet
sensation
when
the
little
one
with
the
active
hands
of
children
that
can
not
talk
touched
her
chin
and
mouth
and
cheeks
persisted
in
putting
her
fingers
in
her
eyes
rested
them
playfully
on
the
lids
and
kept
them
moving
over
her
whole
face
tickling
and
tormenting
her
with
the
dear
little
digits
that
seem
to
grope
in
the
dark
for
a
mother
features
it
was
as
if
her
child
life
and
warmth
were
wandering
over
her
face
from
time
to
time
she
would
bestow
half
of
her
smile
on
jupillon
over
the
little
one
head
and
would
call
to
him
do
look
at
her
then
the
child
would
fall
asleep
with
the
open
mouth
that
laughs
in
sleep
germinie
would
lean
over
her
and
listen
to
her
breathing
in
repose
and
soothed
by
the
peaceful
respiration
she
would
gradually
forget
herself
as
she
gazed
dreamily
at
the
poor
abode
of
her
happiness
the
rustic
garden
the
with
their
leaves
covered
with
little
yellow
snails
and
the
apples
on
the
southern
limbs
the
poles
at
whose
feet
the
beanstalks
twisted
and
parched
were
beginning
to
climb
the
square
of
cabbages
the
four
sunflowers
in
the
little
circle
in
the
centre
of
the
path
and
close
beside
her
on
the
edge
of
the
stream
the
patches
of
grass
covered
with
dog
mercury
the
white
heads
of
the
nettles
against
the
wall
the
washerwomen
boxes
the
bottles
of
lye
and
the
bundle
of
straw
scattered
about
by
the
antics
of
a
puppy
just
out
of
the
water
she
gazed
and
dreamed
she
thought
of
the
past
having
her
future
on
her
knees
with
the
grass
and
the
trees
and
the
river
that
were
before
her
eyes
she
reconstructed
in
memory
the
rustic
garden
of
her
rustic
childhood
she
saw
again
the
two
stones
reaching
down
to
the
water
from
which
her
mother
when
she
was
a
little
child
used
to
wash
her
feet
before
putting
her
to
bed
in
summertime
look
you
père
remalard
said
jupillon
from
his
board
on
one
of
the
hottest
days
in
august
to
the
peasant
who
was
watching
him
do
you
know
they
wo
bite
at
the
red
worm
worth
a
sou
you
must
try
the
gentle
rejoined
the
peasant
sententiously
all
right
i
have
my
revenge
with
the
gentle
père
remalard
you
must
get
some
calf
lights
thursday
you
hang
up
in
that
tree
and
sunday
we
see
on
the
sunday
jupillon
had
miraculous
success
with
his
fishing
and
germinie
heard
the
first
syllable
issue
from
her
daughter
mouth
xxii
on
wednesday
morning
when
she
came
downstairs
germinie
found
a
letter
for
herself
in
that
letter
written
on
the
back
of
a
laundry
receipt
the
remalard
woman
informed
her
that
her
child
had
fallen
sick
almost
immediately
after
her
departure
that
she
had
grown
steadily
worse
that
she
had
consulted
the
doctor
that
he
said
some
insect
had
stung
the
child
that
she
had
been
to
him
a
second
time
that
she
did
not
know
what
more
to
do
that
she
had
had
pilgrimages
made
for
her
the
letter
concluded
thus
if
you
could
see
how
troubled
i
am
for
your
little
one
if
you
could
see
how
good
she
is
when
she
is
suffering
this
letter
produced
upon
germinie
the
effect
of
a
push
from
behind
she
went
out
and
instinctively
walked
toward
the
railroad
that
would
take
her
to
her
little
one
her
hair
was
uncombed
and
she
was
in
her
slippers
but
she
did
not
think
of
that
she
must
see
her
child
she
must
see
her
instantly
then
she
would
come
back
she
thought
of
mademoiselle
breakfast
for
a
moment
then
forgot
it
suddenly
to
the
station
she
saw
a
clock
at
a
cab
office
and
noticed
the
hour
she
remembered
that
there
was
no
train
at
that
time
she
retraced
her
steps
saying
to
herself
that
she
would
hurry
the
breakfast
and
then
make
some
excuse
to
be
given
her
liberty
for
the
rest
of
the
day
but
when
the
breakfast
was
served
she
could
find
none
her
mind
was
so
full
of
her
child
that
she
could
not
invent
a
falsehood
her
imagination
was
benumbed
and
then
if
she
had
spoken
if
she
had
made
the
request
she
would
have
betrayed
herself
she
could
feel
the
words
upon
her
lips
i
want
to
go
and
see
my
child
at
night
she
dared
not
make
her
escape
mademoiselle
had
been
a
little
indisposed
the
night
before
she
was
afraid
that
she
might
need
her
the
next
morning
when
she
entered
mademoiselle
room
with
a
fable
she
had
invented
during
the
night
all
ready
to
ask
for
leave
of
absence
mademoiselle
said
to
her
looking
up
from
a
letter
that
had
just
been
sent
up
to
her
from
the
lodge
ah
my
old
friend
de
belleuse
wants
you
for
the
whole
day
to
help
her
with
her
preserves
come
give
me
my
two
eggs
and
off
with
you
eh
what
does
that
suit
you
what
the
matter
with
me
why
nothing
at
all
germinie
found
strength
to
say
all
that
endless
day
she
passed
standing
over
hot
stewpans
and
sealing
up
jars
in
the
torture
known
only
to
those
whom
the
chances
of
life
detain
at
a
distance
from
the
sick
bed
of
those
dear
to
them
she
suffered
such
agony
as
those
unhappy
creatures
suffer
who
can
not
go
where
their
anxiety
calls
them
and
who
in
the
extremity
of
despair
caused
by
separation
and
uncertainty
constantly
imagine
that
death
will
come
in
their
absence
as
she
received
no
letter
thursday
evening
and
none
friday
morning
she
took
courage
if
the
little
one
were
growing
worse
the
nurse
would
have
written
her
the
little
one
was
better
she
imagined
her
saved
cured
children
are
forever
coming
near
dying
and
they
get
well
so
quickly
and
then
hers
was
strong
she
decided
to
wait
to
be
patient
until
sunday
which
was
only
hours
away
deceiving
the
remainder
of
her
fears
with
the
superstitions
that
say
yes
to
hope
persuading
herself
that
her
daughter
had
escaped
because
the
first
person
she
met
in
the
morning
was
a
man
because
she
had
seen
a
red
horse
in
the
street
because
she
had
guessed
that
a
certain
person
would
turn
into
a
certain
street
because
she
had
ascended
a
flight
of
stairs
in
so
many
strides
on
saturday
in
the
morning
when
she
entered
mère
jupillon
shop
she
found
her
weeping
hot
tears
over
a
lump
of
butter
that
she
was
covering
with
a
moist
cloth
ah
it
you
is
it
said
mère
jupillon
that
poor
charcoal
woman
see
i
actually
crying
over
her
she
just
went
away
from
here
you
do
know
they
ca
get
their
faces
clean
in
their
trade
with
anything
but
butter
and
here
her
love
of
a
daughter
she
at
death
door
you
know
the
dear
child
that
the
way
it
is
with
us
ah
yes
well
as
i
was
saying
she
said
to
her
just
now
like
this
i
want
you
to
wash
my
face
in
butter
right
away
for
the
good
god
and
mère
jupillon
began
to
sob
germinie
had
fled
all
that
day
she
was
unable
to
keep
still
again
and
again
she
went
up
to
her
chamber
to
prepare
the
few
things
she
proposed
to
take
to
her
little
one
the
next
day
to
dress
her
cleanly
to
make
a
little
special
toilet
for
her
in
honor
of
her
recovery
as
she
went
down
in
the
evening
to
put
mademoiselle
to
bed
adèle
handed
her
a
letter
that
she
had
found
for
her
below
xxiii
mademoiselle
had
begun
to
undress
when
germinie
entered
her
bedroom
walked
a
few
steps
dropped
upon
a
chair
and
almost
immediately
after
two
or
three
deep
sighs
mademoiselle
saw
her
throw
herself
backward
wringing
her
hands
and
at
last
roll
from
the
chair
to
the
floor
she
tried
to
lift
her
up
but
germinie
was
shaken
by
such
violent
convulsions
that
the
old
woman
was
obliged
to
let
the
frantic
body
fall
again
upon
the
floor
for
all
the
limbs
which
were
for
a
moment
contracted
and
rigid
lashed
out
to
right
and
left
at
random
with
the
sharp
report
of
the
trigger
of
a
rifle
and
threw
down
whatever
they
came
in
contact
with
at
mademoiselle
shrieks
on
the
landing
a
maid
ran
to
a
doctor
office
near
by
but
did
not
find
him
four
other
women
employed
in
the
house
assisted
mademoiselle
to
lift
germinie
up
and
carry
her
to
the
bed
in
her
mistress
room
on
which
they
laid
her
after
cutting
her
corset
lacings
the
terrible
convulsions
the
nervous
contortions
of
the
limbs
the
snapping
of
the
tendons
had
ceased
but
her
neck
and
her
breast
which
was
uncovered
where
her
dress
was
unbuttoned
moved
up
and
down
as
if
waves
were
rising
and
falling
under
the
skin
and
the
rustling
of
the
skirts
showed
that
the
movement
extended
to
her
feet
her
head
thrown
back
her
face
flushed
her
eyes
full
of
melancholy
tenderness
of
the
patient
agony
we
see
in
the
eyes
of
the
wounded
the
great
veins
clearly
marked
under
her
chin
germinie
breathing
hard
and
paying
no
heed
to
questions
raised
her
hands
to
her
neck
and
throat
and
clawed
at
them
she
seemed
to
be
trying
to
tear
out
the
sensation
of
something
rising
and
falling
within
her
in
vain
did
they
make
her
inhale
ether
and
drink
water
the
waves
of
grief
that
flowed
through
her
body
did
not
cease
their
action
and
her
face
continued
to
wear
the
same
expression
of
gentle
melancholy
and
sentimental
anxiety
which
seemed
to
place
the
suffering
of
the
heart
above
the
suffering
of
the
flesh
in
every
feature
for
a
long
time
everything
seemed
to
wound
her
senses
and
to
produce
a
painful
effect
upon
them
the
bright
light
the
sound
of
voices
the
odor
of
the
things
about
her
at
last
after
an
hour
or
more
a
deluge
of
tears
suddenly
poured
from
her
eyes
and
put
an
end
to
the
terrible
crisis
after
that
there
was
nothing
more
than
an
occasional
convulsive
shudder
in
the
overburdened
body
soon
quieted
by
weariness
and
by
general
prostration
it
was
possible
to
carry
germinie
to
her
own
room
the
letter
adèle
handed
her
contained
the
news
of
her
daughter
death
xxiv
as
a
result
of
this
crisis
germinie
fell
into
a
state
of
dumb
brutish
sorrow
for
months
she
was
insensible
to
everything
for
months
completely
possessed
and
absorbed
by
the
thought
of
the
little
creature
that
was
no
more
she
carried
her
child
death
in
her
entrails
as
she
had
carried
her
life
every
evening
when
she
went
up
to
her
chamber
she
took
the
poor
darling
little
cap
and
dress
from
the
trunk
at
the
foot
of
her
bed
she
would
gaze
at
them
and
touch
them
she
would
lay
them
out
on
the
bed
she
would
sit
for
hours
weeping
over
them
kissing
them
talking
to
them
saying
the
things
that
a
mother
bitter
sorrow
is
wont
to
say
to
a
little
daughter
ghost
while
weeping
for
her
daughter
the
unhappy
creature
wept
for
herself
as
well
a
voice
whispered
to
her
that
she
was
saved
had
the
child
lived
that
to
have
that
child
to
love
was
her
providence
that
all
that
she
dreaded
in
herself
would
be
expended
upon
that
dear
head
and
be
sanctified
there
her
affections
her
unreasoning
impulses
her
ardor
all
the
passions
of
her
nature
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
felt
her
mother
heart
soothing
and
purifying
her
woman
heart
in
her
daughter
she
saw
a
sort
of
celestial
vision
that
would
redeem
her
and
make
her
whole
a
little
angel
of
deliverance
as
it
were
issuing
from
her
errors
to
fight
for
her
and
rescue
her
from
the
evil
influences
which
pursued
her
and
by
which
she
sometimes
thought
that
she
was
possessed
when
she
began
to
recover
from
the
first
prostration
of
despair
when
as
the
consciousness
of
life
and
the
perception
of
objects
returned
to
her
she
looked
about
her
with
eyes
that
saw
she
was
aroused
from
her
grief
by
a
more
poignant
cause
of
bitterness
of
spirit
madame
jupillon
who
had
become
too
stout
and
too
heavy
to
do
what
it
was
necessary
for
her
to
do
at
the
creamery
notwithstanding
all
the
assistance
rendered
by
germinie
had
sent
to
her
province
for
a
niece
of
hers
she
was
the
embodiment
of
the
blooming
youth
of
the
country
a
woman
in
whom
there
was
still
something
of
the
child
active
and
vivacious
with
black
eyes
full
of
sunlight
lips
as
round
and
red
as
cherries
the
summer
heat
of
her
province
in
her
complexion
the
warmth
of
perfect
health
in
her
blood
impulsive
and
ingenuous
as
she
was
the
girl
had
at
first
drawn
near
to
her
cousin
simply
and
naturally
obeying
the
law
of
attraction
that
draws
the
young
toward
the
young
she
had
met
his
friendly
advances
with
the
immodesty
of
innocence
artless
effrontery
the
liberties
taught
by
life
in
the
country
the
happy
folly
of
a
nature
abounding
in
high
spirits
and
with
all
sorts
of
ignorant
hardihood
unblushing
ingenuousness
and
rustic
coquetry
against
which
her
cousin
vanity
was
without
means
of
defence
the
child
presence
deprived
germinie
of
all
hope
of
repose
mere
girl
as
she
was
she
wounded
her
every
minute
in
the
day
by
her
presence
her
touch
her
caresses
everything
in
her
amorous
body
that
spoke
of
love
her
preoccupation
with
jupillon
the
work
that
kept
them
constantly
together
the
provincial
wonderment
that
she
constantly
exhibited
the
she
allowed
to
come
to
her
lips
when
the
young
man
had
gone
her
gayety
her
jests
her
healthy
everything
helped
to
exasperate
germinie
and
to
arouse
a
sullen
wrath
within
her
everything
wounded
that
jealous
heart
so
jealous
that
the
very
animals
caused
it
a
bitter
pang
by
seeming
to
love
someone
whom
it
loved
she
dared
not
speak
to
mère
jupillon
and
denounce
the
little
one
to
her
for
fear
of
betraying
herself
but
whenever
she
found
herself
alone
with
jupillon
she
vented
her
feelings
in
recriminations
complaints
and
quarrels
she
would
remind
him
of
an
incident
a
word
something
he
had
done
or
said
some
answer
he
had
made
a
trifle
forgotten
by
him
but
still
bleeding
in
her
heart
are
you
mad
jupillon
would
say
to
her
a
slip
of
a
girl
a
slip
of
a
girl
eh
nonsense
when
she
has
such
eyes
that
all
the
men
stare
at
her
in
the
street
i
went
out
with
her
the
other
day
i
was
ashamed
i
do
know
how
she
did
it
but
we
were
followed
by
a
gentleman
all
the
time
well
what
if
you
were
she
a
pretty
girl
you
know
pretty
pretty
and
at
that
word
germinie
would
hurl
herself
figuratively
speaking
at
the
girl
face
and
claw
it
to
pieces
with
frantic
words
often
she
would
end
by
saying
to
jupillon
look
here
you
love
her
well
what
then
he
would
retort
highly
entertained
by
these
disputes
by
the
opportunity
to
watch
the
antics
of
this
fierce
wrath
which
he
fanned
with
pretended
sulkiness
and
by
the
excitement
of
trifling
with
the
woman
whom
he
saw
to
be
half
insane
under
his
sarcasms
and
his
indifference
stumbling
wildly
about
and
running
her
head
against
stone
walls
in
the
first
paroxysms
of
madness
as
a
result
of
these
scenes
repeated
almost
every
day
a
revolution
took
place
in
that
excitable
extreme
character
which
knew
no
middle
course
in
that
heart
in
which
the
most
violent
passions
were
constantly
clashing
love
in
which
poison
had
long
been
at
work
became
decomposed
and
changed
to
hate
germinie
began
to
detest
her
lover
and
to
seek
out
every
possible
pretext
for
hating
him
more
and
her
thoughts
recurred
to
her
daughter
to
the
loss
of
her
child
to
the
cause
of
her
death
and
she
persuaded
herself
that
he
had
killed
her
she
looked
upon
him
as
an
assassin
she
conceived
a
horror
of
him
she
avoided
him
fled
from
him
as
from
the
evil
genius
of
her
life
with
the
terror
that
one
has
of
a
person
who
is
one
bane
xxv
one
morning
after
a
night
passed
by
her
in
turning
over
and
over
in
her
mind
all
her
despairing
thoughts
germinie
went
to
the
creamery
for
her
four
sous
worth
of
milk
and
found
in
the
three
or
four
maids
from
the
neighborhood
engaged
in
taking
an
they
were
seated
at
a
table
gossiping
and
sipping
liqueurs
aha
said
adèle
striking
the
table
with
her
glass

mademoiselle
de
varandeuil

absinthe

soldier

know
he
never
drank
anything
else
it
a
little
stiff
eh
ah
yes
said
germinie
contracting
her
lips
and
winking
like
a
child
who
is
given
a
glass
of
liqueur
with
the
dessert
at
a
grand
it
good
all
the
same
her
spirits
rose
madame
jupillon
have
the
bottle

pay
and
she
tossed
money
on
the
table
after
the
third
glass
she
cried
i
am
and
she
roared
with
laughter
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
had
gone
out
that
morning
to
collect
her
income
when
she
returned
at
eleven
she
rang
once
twice
no
one
came
ah
she
said
to
herself
she
must
have
gone
down
she
opened
the
door
with
her
key
went
to
her
bedroom
and
looked
in
the
mattress
and
bedclothes
lay
in
a
heap
on
two
chairs
and
germinie
was
stretched
out
across
the
straw
sleeping
heavily
like
a
log
in
the
utterly
relaxed
condition
following
a
sudden
attack
of
lethargy
at
the
noise
made
by
mademoiselle
germinie
sprang
to
her
feet
and
passed
her
hand
over
her
yes
she
said
as
if
some
one
had
called
her
her
eyes
were
wandering
what
happened
said
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
in
alarm
did
you
fall
is
anything
the
matter
with
you
with
me
no
germinie
replied
i
fell
asleep
what
time
is
it
nothing
the
matter
ah
what
a
fool
and
she
began
to
shake
the
mattress
turning
her
back
to
her
mistress
to
hide
the
flush
of
intoxication
on
her
face
xxvi
one
sunday
morning
jupillon
was
dressing
in
the
room
germinie
had
furnished
for
him
his
mother
was
sitting
by
gazing
at
him
with
the
wondering
pride
expressed
in
the
eyes
of
mothers
among
the
common
people
in
presence
of
a
son
who
dresses
like
a
you
dressed
up
like
the
young
man
on
the
first
floor
she
said
i
should
think
it
was
his
coat

do
mean
to
say
fine
things

look
well
on
you
too
jupillon
intent
upon
tying
his
cravat
made
no
reply
you
play
the
deuce
with
the
poor
girls
continued
mère
jupillon
giving
to
her
voice
an
accent
of
insinuating
sweetness
look

bibi
let
me
tell
you
this
you

as

and
i
fixed
her
so
that
she
see
anything
yes
germinie
would
do
as
you
seemed
to
like
her
that
prevented
you
from
wasting
your
money
on
bad
women
and
then
i
see
anything
out
of
the
way
in
the
girl
till
now
but
now

heap
of
horrible
things
about

pack
of
vipers

when

an
honest
woman
all
her
life
thank

what
will

mademoiselle
would
only
have
to
put
the
end
of
her
nose
into
her
maid
affairs
why

the
law

bare
idea

a
turn

bottles
of

so
that

great
day

fine
gloves

make
you
look
more
dignified
germinie
arrived
at
seven
happy
and
bright
and
hopeful
her
head
filled
with
blissful
dreams
by
the
mysterious
air
with
which
jupillon
delivered
his
mother
invitation
they
dined
and
drank
and
made
merry
mère
jupillon
began
to
cast
glances
expressive
of
deep
emotion
drowned
in
tears
upon
the
couple
sitting
opposite
her
when
the
coffee
was
served
she
said
as
if
for
the
purpose
of
being
left
alone
with
germinie
bibi
you
know
you
have
an
errand
to
do
this
evening
jupillon
went
out
madame
jupillon
as
she
sipped
her
coffee
turned
to
germinie
the
face
of
a
mother
seeking
to
learn
her
daughter
secret
and
in
her
indulgence
forgiving
her
in
advance
of
her
confession
for
a
moment
the
two
women
sat
thus
silent
one
waiting
for
the
other
to
speak
the
other
with
the
cry
of
her
heart
on
her
lips
suddenly
germinie
rushed
from
her
chair
into
the
stout
woman
arms
if
you
knew
madame
jupillon
she
talked
and
wept
and
embraced
her
all
at
once
oh
you
wo
be
angry
with
me
well
yes
i
love
him
i
had
a
child
by
him
true
i
love
him
three
years
ago
at
every
word
madame
jupillon
face
became
sterner
and
more
icy
she
coldly
pushed
germinie
away
and
in
her
most
doleful
voice
with
an
accent
of
lamentation
and
hopeless
desolation
she
began
like
a
person
who
is
suffocating
oh
my
god
you
tell
me
such
things
as
that
me
his
mother
to
my
face
my
god

be
my
son

child
an
innocent
child

the
face
to
ruin
him
for
me
and
now

tell
me
that
you
did
it
no
it

possible

god
and
i
had
such
confidence
there

worth
living
for
there
no
trusting
anybody
in
this
world
all
the
same
mademoiselle
i
ever
believed
it
of
you
such
things
give
me
a
turn
ah
this
upsets
me
completely
i
know
myself
and
i
quite
likely
to
be
sick
after
this
madame
jupillon
madame
jupillon
germinie
murmured
in
an
imploring
tone
half
dead
with
shame
and
grief
on
the
chair
on
which
she
had
fallen
i
beg
you
to
forgive
me
it
was
stronger
than
i
was
and
then
i
thought
i
believed
you
believed
oh
my
god
you
believed
what
did
you
believe
that
you
be
my
son
wife
eh
ah
lord
god
is
it
possible
my
poor
child
and
adopting
a
more
and
more
plaintive
and
lamentable
tone
as
the
words
she
hurled
at
germinie
cut
deeper
and
deeper
mère
jupillon
continued
but
my
poor
girl
you
must
have
a
reason
let
hear
it
what
did
i
always
tell
you
that
it
would
be
all
right
if
you
been
born
ten
years
earlier
let
see
your
date
was
you
told
me
and
now
it
you
getting
on
toward
thirty
you
see
my
dear
child
i
say
it
makes
me
feel
bad
to
say
that
to
you
i
so
much
rather
not
hurt
you
but
a
body
only
has
to
look
at
you
my
poor
young
lady
what
can
i
do
your
age
your
hair
i
can
lay
my
finger
in
the
place
where
you
part
it
but
said
germinie
in
whose
heart
black
wrath
was
beginning
to
rumble
what
about
what
your
son
owes
me
my
money
the
money
i
took
out
of
the
savings
bank
the
money
i
borrowed
for
him
the
money
i
money
he
owes
you
money
oh
yes
what
you
lent
him
to
begin
business
with
well
what
about
it
do
you
think
we
thieves
does
anyone
want
to
cheat
you
out
of
your
old
money
although
there
was
any
paper
i
know
it
because
the
other
day
it
just
occurs
to
me
that
honest
man
of
a
child
of
mine
wanted
to
write
it
down
for
fear
he
might
die
but
the
next
minute
we
pickpockets
as
glib
as
you
please
oh
my
god
hardly
worth
while
living
in
such
times
as
these
ah
i
well
paid
for
getting
attached
to
you
but
i
see
through
it
now
you
a
politician
you
are
you
wanted
to
pay
yourself
with
my
son
for
his
whole
life
excuse
me
no
thank
you
it
costs
less
to
give
back
your
money
a
café
waiter
leavings
my
poor
dear
boy
god
preserve
him
from
it
germinie
had
snatched
her
shawl
and
hat
from
the
hook
and
was
out
of
doors
xxvii
mademoiselle
was
sitting
in
her
large
armchair
at
the
corner
of
the
fireplace
where
a
few
live
embers
were
still
sleeping
under
the
ashes
her
black
cap
was
pulled
down
over
her
wrinkled
forehead
almost
to
her
eyes
her
black
dress
cut
in
the
shape
of
a
child
frock
was
draped
in
scanty
folds
about
her
scanty
body
showing
the
location
of
every
bone
and
fell
straight
from
her
knees
to
the
floor
she
wore
a
small
black
shawl
crossed
on
her
breast
and
tied
behind
her
back
as
they
are
worn
by
little
girls
her
hands
were
resting
on
her
hips
with
the
palms
turned
outward
thin
old
woman
hands
awkward
and
stiff
and
swollen
with
gout
at
the
knuckles
and
finger
joints
sitting
in
the
huddled
crouching
posture
that
compels
old
people
to
raise
their
heads
to
look
at
you
and
speak
to
you
she
seemed
to
be
buried
in
all
that
mass
of
black
whence
nothing
emerged
but
her
face
to
which
preponderance
of
bile
had
imparted
the
yellow
hue
of
old
ivory
and
the
flashing
glance
of
her
brown
eyes
one
who
saw
her
thus
her
bright
sparkling
eyes
the
meagre
body
the
garb
of
poverty
and
the
noble
air
with
which
she
bore
all
the
burdens
of
age
might
well
have
fancied
that
he
was
looking
at
a
fairy
on
the
stage
of
the
germinie
was
by
her
side
the
old
lady
began
the
list
is
still
under
the
door
eh
germinie
yes
mademoiselle
do
you
know
my
girl
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
resumed
after
a
pause
do
you
know
that
when
one
is
born
in
one
of
the
finest
houses
on
rue
royale
when
one
has
been
in
a
fair
way
to
own
the
grand
and
when
one
has
almost
had
the
château
of
for
a
country
house
and
when
it
took
two
servants
to
carry
the
silver
platter
on
which
the
joint
was
served
at
your
grandmother
do
you
know
that
it
takes
no
small
amount
of
philosophy
and
mademoiselle
with
difficulty
raised
a
hand
to
her
shoulder
to
see
yourself
end
like
this
in
this
devilish
nest
of
rheumatism
where
in
spite
of
all
the
list
in
the
world
you
ca
keep
out
of
that
it
stir
up
the
fire
a
little
she
put
out
her
feet
toward
germinie
who
was
kneeling
in
front
of
the
fireplace
and
laughingly
placed
them
under
her
nose
do
you
know
that
that
takes
no
small
amount
of
philosophy
to
wear
stockings
out
at
heel
simpleton
i
not
scolding
you
i
know
well
enough
that
you
ca
do
everything
so
you
might
as
well
have
a
woman
come
to
do
the
mending
that
not
very
much
to
do
why
do
you
speak
to
that
little
girl
that
came
here
last
year
she
had
a
face
that
i
remember
oh
she
black
as
a
mole
mademoiselle
bah
i
knew
it
in
the
first
place
you
never
think
well
of
anybody
that
is
true
you
say
why
was
she
a
niece
of
mère
jupillon
we
might
take
her
for
one
or
two
days
a
week
that
hussy
shall
never
set
foot
here
nonsense
more
fables
you
a
most
astonishing
creature
to
adore
people
and
then
not
want
to
see
them
again
what
has
she
done
to
you
she
a
lost
creature
i
tell
you
bah
what
does
my
linen
care
for
that
but
mademoiselle
all
right
find
me
someone
else
then
i
do
care
about
her
particularly
but
find
me
someone
oh
the
women
that
come
in
like
that
do
do
any
work
i
mend
your
clothes
you
do
need
any
one
you
oh
if
we
have
to
rely
on
your
needle
said
mademoiselle
jocosely
and
then
will
mère
jupillon
ever
give
you
the
time
madame
jupillon
oh
for
all
the
dust
i
shall
ever
leave
in
her
house
again
what
that
she
too
so
she
on
your
black
books
is
she
oho
hurry
up
and
make
another
acquaintance
or
else
dieu
de
we
shall
have
some
bad
days
here
xxviii
the
winter
of
that
year
should
certainly
have
assured
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
a
share
of
paradise
hereafter
she
had
to
undergo
the
reflex
action
of
her
maid
chagrin
her
nervous
irritability
the
vengeance
of
her
embittered
contradictory
moods
which
the
approaching
spring
would
ere
long
infect
with
that
species
of
malignant
madness
which
the
critical
season
the
travail
of
nature
and
the
restless
disturbing
fructification
of
the
summer
cause
in
unhealthily
sensitive
organizations
germinie
was
forever
wiping
eyes
which
no
longer
wept
but
which
had
once
wept
copiously
she
was
always
ready
with
an
everlasting
nothing
the
matter
mademoiselle
uttered
in
the
tone
that
covers
a
secret
she
adopted
dumb
despairing
funereal
attitudes
the
airs
by
which
a
woman
body
diffuses
melancholy
and
makes
her
very
shadow
a
bore
with
her
face
her
glance
her
mouth
the
folds
of
her
dress
her
presence
the
noise
she
made
at
work
in
the
adjoining
room
even
with
her
silence
she
enveloped
mademoiselle
in
the
despair
that
exhaled
from
her
person
at
the
slightest
word
she
would
bristle
up
mademoiselle
could
not
address
an
observation
to
her
ask
her
the
most
trivial
question
give
her
an
order
or
express
a
wish
everything
was
taken
by
her
as
a
reproach
and
thereupon
she
would
act
like
a
madwoman
she
would
wipe
her
eyes
and
grumble
oh
i
am
very
unfortunate
i
can
see
that
mademoiselle
does
care
for
me
any
more
her
spite
against
various
people
vented
itself
in
sublimely
ingenious
complaints
that
woman
always
comes
when
it
rains
she
would
say
upon
discovering
a
bit
of
mud
that
madame
de
belleuse
had
left
on
the
carpet
during
the
week
following
new
year
day
the
week
when
all
of
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
remaining
relatives
and
friends
rich
and
poor
alike
climbed
the
five
flights
and
waited
on
the
landing
at
her
door
for
their
turns
to
occupy
the
six
chairs
in
her
bedroom
germinie
redoubled
her
her
impertinent
remarks
her
sulky
muttering
inventing
grievances
against
her
mistress
she
punished
her
constantly
by
a
persistent
silence
which
it
was
impossible
to
break
then
there
would
be
periods
of
frenzied
industry
mademoiselle
would
hear
through
the
partitions
on
all
sides
furious
manipulation
of
the
broom
and
duster
the
sharp
vicious
scrubbing
and
slamming
of
the
servant
whom
one
imagines
muttering
to
herself
as
she
maltreats
the
furniture
oh
yes
i
do
your
work
for
you
old
people
are
patient
with
servants
who
have
been
long
in
their
service
long
habit
the
weakening
the
horror
of
change
the
dread
of
new
faces
everything
disposes
them
to
weakness
and
cowardly
concessions
notwithstanding
her
quick
temper
her
promptness
to
lose
her
head
to
fly
into
a
rage
to
breathe
fire
and
flame
mademoiselle
said
nothing
she
acted
as
if
she
saw
nothing
she
pretended
to
be
reading
when
germinie
entered
the
room
she
waited
curled
up
in
her
until
the
maid
had
blown
over
or
burst
she
bent
her
back
before
the
storm
she
said
no
word
had
no
thought
of
bitterness
against
her
she
simply
pitied
her
for
causing
herself
so
much
suffering
in
truth
germinie
was
not
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
maid
she
was
devotion
waiting
to
close
her
eyes
the
solitary
old
woman
overlooked
by
death
alone
at
the
end
of
her
life
dragging
her
affections
from
grave
to
grave
had
found
her
last
friend
in
her
servant
she
had
rested
her
heart
upon
her
as
upon
an
adopted
daughter
and
she
was
especially
unhappy
because
she
was
powerless
to
comfort
her
moreover
at
intervals
germinie
returned
to
her
from
the
depths
of
her
brooding
melancholy
and
her
savage
humor
and
threw
herself
on
her
knees
before
her
kind
heart
suddenly
at
a
ray
of
sunlight
a
beggar
song
or
any
one
of
the
nothings
that
float
in
the
air
and
expand
the
heart
she
would
burst
into
tears
and
demonstrations
of
affection
her
heart
would
overflow
with
burning
emotions
she
would
seem
to
feel
a
pleasure
in
embracing
her
mistress
as
if
the
joy
of
living
again
had
effaced
everything
at
other
times
some
trifling
ailment
of
mademoiselle
would
bring
about
the
change
a
smile
would
come
to
the
old
servant
face
and
gentleness
to
her
hands
sometimes
at
such
moments
mademoiselle
would
say
come
my
girl
something
the
matter
tell
me
what
it
is
and
germinie
would
reply
no
mademoiselle
it
the
weather
the
weather
mademoiselle
would
repeat
with
a
doubtful
air
the
weather
xxix
one
evening
in
march
the
jupillons
mother
and
son
were
talking
together
by
the
stove
in
their
jupillon
had
been
drafted
the
money
his
mother
had
put
aside
to
purchase
his
release
had
been
used
up
as
a
result
of
six
months
of
poor
business
and
by
credits
given
to
certain
on
the
street
who
had
left
the
key
under
their
one
fine
morning
he
had
not
prospered
in
a
business
way
himself
and
his
stock
in
trade
had
been
taken
on
execution
he
had
been
that
day
to
ask
a
former
employer
to
advance
him
the
money
to
purchase
a
substitute
but
the
old
perfumer
had
not
forgiven
him
for
leaving
him
and
setting
up
for
himself
and
he
refused
mère
jupillon
in
despair
was
complaining
tearfully
she
repeated
the
number
drawn
by
her
son
and
she
said
and
yet
i
sewed
a
black
spider
into
your
with
his
web
a
fellow
he
was
oh
dear
i
ought
to
have
done
as
they
told
me
and
made
you
wear
the
cap
you
were
baptized
in
ah
the
good
god
ai
fair
there
the
fruit
woman
son
drew
a
lucky
number
that
comes
of
being
honest
and
those
two
sluts
at
number
eighteen
must
go
and
hook
it
with
my
money
i
might
have
known
they
meant
something
by
the
way
they
shook
hands
they
did
me
out
of
more
than
seven
hundred
francs
did
you
know
it
and
the
black
creature
opposite
and
that
infernal
girl
as
had
the
face
to
eat
pots
of
strawberries
at
twenty
francs
they
might
as
well
have
taken
me
too
the
hussies
but
you
have
gone
yet
all
the
same
i
rather
sell
the
creamery
i
go
out
to
work
again
do
cooking
or
housekeeping
anything
why
i
draw
money
from
a
stone
for
you
jupillon
smoked
and
let
his
mother
do
the
talking
when
she
had
finished
he
said
that
do
for
talk
mamma
all
that
nothing
but
words
you
spoil
your
digestion
and
it
ai
worth
while
you
sell
anything
you
need
strain
yourself
at
all
i
buy
my
substitute
and
it
cost
you
a
sou
do
you
want
to
bet
on
it
jesus
ejaculated
madame
jupillon
i
have
an
idea
after
a
pause
jupillon
continued
i
did
want
to
make
trouble
with
you
on
account
of
germinie
you
know
at
the
time
the
stories
about
us
were
going
round
you
thought
it
was
time
for
me
to
break
with
her
that
she
would
be
in
our
way
and
you
kicked
her
out
of
the
house
stiff
that
was
my
idea
i
did
think
she
was
so
bad
as
all
that
for
the
family
butter
but
however
you
thought
best
to
do
it
and
perhaps
after
all
you
did
the
best
thing
instead
of
cooling
her
off
you
warmed
her
up
for
me
yes
warmed
her
up
i
met
her
once
or
twice
and
she
changed
i
tell
you
gad
how
she
drying
up
but
you
know
very
well
she
has
got
a
sou
i
do
say
she
has
of
her
own
but
what
that
got
to
do
with
it
she
find
it
somewhere
she
good
for
hundred
shiners
yet
but
suppose
you
get
mixed
up
in
it
oh
she
wo
steal
the
deuce
she
wo
well
if
she
does
it
wo
be
from
anyone
but
her
mistress
do
you
suppose
her
mademoiselle
would
have
her
pinched
for
that
she
turn
her
off
and
that
be
the
end
of
it
we
advise
her
to
try
the
air
in
another
quarter
off
she
goes
and
we
see
her
again
but
it
would
be
too
stupid
for
her
to
steal
she
arrange
it
somehow
hunt
round
and
turn
things
over
i
do
know
how
not
i
but
that
her
affair
you
understand
this
is
the
time
for
her
to
show
her
talents
by
the
way
perhaps
you
do
know
they
say
her
old
woman
sick
if
the
dear
lady
should
happen
to
step
out
and
leave
her
all
the
stuff
as
the
story
goes
in
the
quarter
why
it
would
be
a
bad
thing
to
have
played
with
her
eh
mamma
we
must
put
on
gloves
you
see
mamma
when
we
dealing
with
people
who
may
have
four
or
five
thousand
a
year
come
tumbling
into
their
aprons
oh
my
god
what
are
you
talking
about
but
after
the
way
i
treated
her
oh
no
she
never
come
back
here
well
i
tell
you
i
bring
her
back
and
at
the
latest
said
jupillon
rising
and
rolling
a
cigarette
between
his
fingers
no
excuses
you
know
he
said
to
his
mother
they
wo
do
any
good
and
be
cold
to
her
act
as
if
you
received
her
only
on
my
account
because
you
are
weak
no
one
knows
what
may
happen
we
must
always
keep
an
anchor
to
windward
xxx
jupillon
was
walking
back
and
forth
on
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
germinie
house
when
she
came
out
germinie
he
said
behind
her
she
turned
as
if
she
had
been
struck
and
without
answering
his
greeting
instinctively
moved
on
a
few
steps
as
if
to
fly
from
him
germinie
jupillon
said
nothing
more
than
that
he
did
not
follow
her
he
did
not
move
she
came
back
to
him
like
a
trained
beast
when
his
rope
is
taken
off
what
is
it
said
she
do
you
want
more
money
or
do
you
want
to
tell
me
some
of
your
mother
foolish
remarks
no
but
i
am
going
away
said
jupillon
with
a
serious
face
i
am
drafted
and
i
am
going
away
you
are
going
away
said
she
she
seemed
as
if
her
mind
was
not
awake
look
here
germinie
jupillon
continued
i
have
made
you
unhappy
i
have
been
very
kind
to
you
i
know
my
cousin
been
a
little
to
blame
what
do
you
want
you
going
away
rejoined
germinie
taking
his
arm
do
lie
to
me
are
you
going
away
i
tell
you
yes
and
it
true
i
only
waiting
for
marching
orders
you
have
to
pay
more
than
two
thousand
francs
for
a
substitute
this
year
they
say
there
going
to
be
a
war
however
there
a
chance
as
he
spoke
he
was
leading
germinie
down
the
street
where
are
you
taking
me
said
she
to
mother
of
course
so
that
you
two
can
make
up
and
put
an
end
to
all
this
nonsense
after
what
she
said
to
me
never
and
germinie
pushed
jupillon
arm
away
well
if
that
the
way
it
is
and
jupillon
raised
his
cap
shall
i
write
to
you
from
the
regiment
germinie
was
silent
hesitating
for
a
moment
then
she
said
abruptly
come
on
and
motioning
to
jupillon
to
walk
beside
her
she
turned
back
up
the
street
and
so
they
walked
along
side
by
side
without
a
word
they
reached
a
paved
road
that
stretched
out
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
between
two
lines
of
lanterns
between
two
rows
of
gnarled
trees
that
held
aloft
handfuls
of
bare
branches
and
cast
their
slender
motionless
shadows
on
high
blank
walls
there
in
the
keen
air
chilled
by
the
evaporation
of
the
snow
they
walked
on
and
on
for
a
long
time
burying
themselves
in
the
vague
infinite
unfamiliar
depths
of
a
street
that
follows
the
same
wall
the
same
trees
the
same
lanterns
and
leads
on
to
the
same
darkness
beyond
the
damp
heavy
air
that
they
breathed
smelt
of
sugar
and
tallow
and
carrion
from
time
to
time
a
vivid
flash
passed
before
their
eyes
it
was
the
lantern
of
a
butcher
cart
that
shone
upon
slaughtered
cattle
and
huge
pieces
of
bleeding
meat
thrown
upon
the
back
of
a
white
horse
the
light
upon
the
flesh
amid
the
darkness
resembled
a
purple
conflagration
a
furnace
of
blood
well
have
you
reflected
said
jupillon
this
little
avenue
trudaine
is
a
very
cheerful
place
do
you
know
come
on
germinie
replied
and
without
another
word
she
set
out
again
at
the
same
fierce
jerky
gait
agitated
by
all
the
tumult
raging
in
her
heart
her
thoughts
were
expressed
in
her
gestures
her
feet
went
astray
madness
attacked
her
hands
at
times
her
shadow
seen
from
behind
reminded
one
of
a
woman
from
la
salpêtrière
two
or
three
stopped
for
a
moment
and
looked
after
her
then
remembering
that
they
were
in
paris
passed
on
suddenly
she
stopped
and
with
the
gesture
of
one
who
has
made
a
desperate
resolution
she
said
ah
my
god
another
pin
in
the
cushion
let
us
go
and
she
took
jupillon
arm
oh
i
know
very
well
said
jupillon
when
they
were
near
the
creamery
my
mother
was
fair
to
you
you
see
the
woman
has
been
too
virtuous
all
her
life
she
do
know
she
do
understand
and
then
d
see
i
tell
you
the
whole
secret
she
loves
me
so
much
she
jealous
of
any
woman
who
loves
me
so
go
in
do
and
he
pushed
her
into
the
arms
of
madame
jupillon
who
kissed
her
mumbled
a
few
words
of
regret
and
made
haste
to
weep
in
order
to
relieve
her
own
embarrassment
and
make
the
scene
more
affecting
throughout
the
evening
germinie
sat
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
jupillon
almost
terrifying
him
with
her
expression
come
come
he
said
as
he
walked
home
with
her
do
be
so
down
in
the
mouth
as
all
this
we
must
have
a
little
philosophy
in
this
world
well
here
i
am
a
soldier
that
all
to
be
sure
they
do
all
come
back
but
then
look
here
i
propose
that
we
enjoy
ourselves
for
the
fortnight
that
left
because
it
will
be
so
much
gained
and
if
i
come
back
well
at
all
events
i
shall
leave
you
a
pleasant
memory
of
me
germinie
made
no
reply
xxxi
for
a
whole
week
germinie
did
not
set
foot
in
the
shop
again
the
jupillons
when
she
did
not
return
began
to
despair
at
last
one
evening
about
half
past
ten
she
pushed
the
door
open
entered
the
shop
without
a
word
of
greeting
walked
up
to
the
little
table
where
the
mother
and
son
were
sitting
half
asleep
and
placed
upon
it
beneath
her
hand
which
was
closed
like
a
claw
an
old
piece
of
cloth
that
gave
forth
a
ringing
sound
there
it
is
said
she
and
letting
go
the
corners
of
the
cloth
she
emptied
its
contents
on
the
table
forth
came
greasy
patched
on
the
back
fastened
together
with
pins
old
tarnished
louis
black
pieces
pieces
pieces
the
money
of
the
poor
the
money
of
toil
money
from
money
soiled
by
dirty
hands
worn
out
in
leather
purses
rubbed
smooth
in
the
cash
drawer
filled
with
sous
money
with
a
flavor
of
perspiration
for
a
moment
she
gazed
at
the
display
as
if
to
assure
her
own
eyes
then
she
said
to
madame
jupillon
in
a
sad
voice
the
voice
of
her
sacrifice
there
it
is
there
the
two
thousand
three
hundred
francs
for
him
to
buy
a
substitute
oh
my
dear
germinie
said
the
stout
woman
almost
suffocated
by
emotion
and
she
threw
herself
upon
germinie
neck
who
submitted
to
be
embraced
oh
you
must
take
something
with
us
a
cup
of
coffee
no
thank
you
said
germinie
i
am
done
up
i
had
to
fly
around
you
know
to
get
them
i
going
to
bed
now
some
other
time
and
she
went
away
she
had
had
to
fly
around
as
she
said
to
scrape
together
such
a
sum
to
accomplish
that
impossibility
to
raise
two
thousand
three
hundred
francs
two
thousand
three
hundred
francs
of
which
she
had
not
the
first
five
she
had
collected
them
begged
them
extorted
them
piece
by
piece
almost
sou
by
sou
she
had
picked
them
up
scraped
them
together
here
and
there
from
this
one
and
from
that
one
by
loans
of
two
hundred
one
hundred
fifty
twenty
francs
or
whatever
sum
anyone
would
lend
she
had
borrowed
from
her
concierge
her
grocer
her
fruit
woman
her
poulterer
her
laundress
she
had
borrowed
from
all
the
dealers
in
the
quarter
and
from
the
dealers
in
the
quarters
where
she
had
previously
lived
with
mademoiselle
she
had
made
up
the
amount
with
money
drawn
from
every
source
even
from
her
poor
miserable
she
had
gone
everywhere
importuned
humbly
prayed
implored
invented
fables
swallowed
the
shame
of
lying
and
of
seeing
that
she
was
not
believed
the
humiliation
of
confessing
that
she
had
no
money
laid
by
as
was
supposed
and
as
through
pride
she
had
encouraged
people
to
suppose
the
sympathy
of
people
she
despised
the
refusals
the
alms
she
had
undergone
everything
endured
what
she
would
not
have
endured
to
procure
bread
for
herself
and
not
once
only
with
a
single
person
but
with
thirty
forty
all
those
who
had
given
her
something
or
from
whom
she
had
hoped
for
something

xxxi
last
one
evening
about
half
past
ten
she
pushed
the
door
open
entered
the
shop
without
a
word
of
greeting
walked
up
to
the
little
table
where
the
mother
and
son
were
sitting
half
asleep
and
placed
upon
it
beneath
her
hand
which
was
closed
like
a
claw
an
old
piece
of
cloth
that
gave
forth
a
ringing
there
it
is
said
at
last
she
had
succeeded
in
collecting
the
money
but
it
was
her
master
and
had
possession
of
her
forever
her
life
thenceforth
belonged
to
the
obligations
she
had
entered
into
with
all
these
people
to
the
service
her
dealers
had
rendered
her
knowing
very
well
what
they
were
doing
she
belonged
to
her
debt
to
the
sum
she
would
have
to
pay
every
year
she
knew
it
she
knew
that
all
her
wages
would
go
in
that
way
that
with
the
rates
of
interest
which
she
had
left
entirely
at
the
discretion
of
her
creditors
and
the
written
obligations
demanded
by
them
mademoiselle
three
hundred
francs
would
hardly
suffice
to
pay
the
interest
on
the
hundred
she
had
borrowed
she
knew
that
she
was
in
debt
that
she
should
be
in
debt
forever
that
she
was
doomed
forever
to
privation
and
embarrassment
to
the
strictest
economy
in
her
manner
of
living
and
her
dress
she
had
hardly
any
more
illusions
as
to
the
jupillons
than
as
to
her
own
future
she
had
a
presentiment
that
her
money
was
lost
so
far
as
they
were
concerned
she
had
not
even
based
any
hopes
on
the
possibility
that
this
sacrifice
would
touch
the
young
man
she
had
acted
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
if
she
had
been
told
to
die
to
prevent
his
going
she
would
have
died
the
idea
of
seeing
him
a
soldier
the
idea
of
the
battlefield
the
cannon
the
wounded
in
presence
of
which
a
woman
shuts
her
eyes
in
terror
had
led
her
to
do
something
more
than
die
to
sell
her
life
for
that
man
to
consign
herself
to
everlasting
poverty
xxxii
disorders
of
the
nervous
system
frequently
result
in
disarranging
the
natural
sequence
of
human
joys
and
sorrows
in
destroying
their
proportion
and
equilibrium
and
in
carrying
them
to
the
greatest
possible
excess
it
seems
that
under
the
influence
of
this
disease
of
sensitiveness
the
sharpened
refined
spiritualized
sensations
exceed
their
natural
measure
and
limits
reach
a
point
beyond
themselves
and
as
it
were
make
the
enjoyment
and
suffering
of
the
individual
infinite
so
the
infrequent
joys
that
germinie
still
knew
were
insane
joys
from
which
she
emerged
drunk
and
with
the
physical
symptoms
of
why
my
girl
mademoiselle
sometimes
could
not
forbear
saying
anyone
would
think
you
were
tipsy
mademoiselle
makes
you
pay
dear
for
a
little
amusement
once
in
a
while
germinie
would
reply
and
when
she
relapsed
into
her
sorrowful
disappointed
restless
condition
her
desolation
was
more
intense
more
frantic
and
delirious
than
her
gayety
the
moment
had
arrived
when
the
terrible
truth
which
she
had
suspected
before
at
last
became
clear
to
her
she
saw
that
she
had
failed
to
lay
hold
of
jupillon
by
the
devotion
her
love
had
manifested
by
stripping
herself
of
all
she
possessed
by
all
the
pecuniary
sacrifices
which
involved
her
life
in
the
toils
and
embarrassment
of
a
debt
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
pay
she
felt
that
he
gave
her
his
love
grudgingly
a
love
to
which
he
imparted
all
the
humiliation
of
an
act
of
charity
when
she
told
him
that
she
was
again
the
man
whom
she
was
about
to
make
a
father
once
more
said
to
her
well
women
like
you
are
amusing
creatures
always
full
or
just
empty
she
conceived
the
ideas
the
suspicions
that
come
to
genuine
love
when
it
is
betrayed
the
presentiments
of
the
heart
that
tell
women
they
are
no
longer
in
undisputed
possession
of
their
lovers
and
that
there
is
another
because
there
is
likely
to
be
another
she
complained
no
more
she
wept
no
more
she
indulged
no
more
in
recrimination
she
abandoned
the
struggle
with
this
man
armed
with
indifference
who
with
the
sarcasm
of
the
vulgar
cad
was
so
expert
in
insulting
her
passion
her
unreasoning
impulses
her
wild
outbursts
of
affection
and
so
in
agonizing
resignation
she
set
herself
the
task
of
waiting
for
what
she
did
not
know
perhaps
until
he
would
have
no
more
of
her
and
silent
she
kept
watch
upon
jupillon
she
followed
him
about
and
never
lost
sight
of
him
she
tried
to
make
him
speak
by
interjecting
remarks
in
his
fits
of
distraction
she
hovered
about
him
but
she
saw
nothing
wrong
she
could
lay
hold
of
nothing
detect
nothing
and
yet
she
was
convinced
that
there
was
something
and
that
what
she
feared
was
true
she
felt
a
woman
presence
in
the
air
one
morning
as
she
went
down
the
street
rather
earlier
than
usual
she
spied
him
a
few
yards
before
her
on
the
sidewalk
he
was
dressed
up
and
constantly
looked
himself
over
as
he
walked
along
from
time
to
time
he
raised
his
trouser
leg
a
little
to
see
the
polish
on
his
boots
she
followed
him
he
went
straight
on
without
looking
back
she
was
not
far
behind
him
when
he
reached
place
bréda
there
was
a
woman
walking
on
the
square
beside
the
cabstand
germinie
could
see
nothing
of
her
but
her
back
jupillon
went
up
to
her
and
she
turned
it
was
his
cousin
they
began
to
walk
side
by
side
up
and
down
the
square
then
they
started
through
rue
bréda
toward
rue
de
navarin
there
the
girl
took
arm
she
did
not
lean
on
it
at
first
but
little
by
little
as
they
proceeded
she
leaned
toward
him
with
the
movement
of
a
branch
when
it
is
bent
and
drew
closer
and
closer
they
walked
slowly
so
slowly
that
at
times
germinie
was
obliged
to
stop
in
order
to
keep
at
a
safe
distance
from
them
they
ascended
rue
des
martyrs
passed
through
rue
de
la
tour
and
went
down
rue
montholon
jupillon
was
talking
earnestly
the
cousin
said
nothing
but
listened
to
jupillon
and
walked
on
with
the
air
of
a
woman
smelling
of
a
bouquet
now
and
then
darting
a
little
vague
glance
on
one
side
or
the
other
the
glance
of
a
frightened
child
when
they
reached
rue
lamartine
opposite
the
passage
des
they
turned
germinie
had
barely
time
to
throw
herself
in
at
a
hall
door
they
passed
without
seeing
her
the
little
one
was
very
serious
and
walked
slowly
jupillon
was
talking
into
her
ear
they
stopped
for
a
moment
jupillon
gesticulated
earnestly
the
girl
stared
fixedly
at
the
pavement
germinie
thought
they
were
about
to
part
but
they
resumed
their
walk
together
and
made
four
or
five
turns
passing
back
and
forth
by
the
end
of
the
passage
at
last
they
turned
in
germinie
darted
from
her
and
rushed
after
them
from
the
gateway
of
the
passage
she
saw
the
skirt
of
a
dress
disappear
through
the
door
of
a
small
furnished
beside
a
wine
shop
she
ran
to
the
door
looked
into
the
hall
and
could
see
nothing
thereupon
all
her
blood
rushed
to
her
head
with
one
thought
a
single
thought
that
her
lips
kept
repeating
like
an
idiot
vitriol
vitriol
vitriol
and
as
her
thoughts
were
instantly
transformed
into
the
act
of
which
she
thought
and
her
delirium
transported
her
abruptly
to
the
crime
she
contemplated
she
said
to
herself
that
she
would
go
up
the
stairs
with
the
bottle
well
hidden
under
her
shawl
she
would
knock
at
the
door
very
loud
and
continuously
he
would
come
at
last
and
would
open
the
door
a
crack
she
would
say
nothing
to
him
not
her
name
even
she
would
go
in
without
heeding
him
she
was
strong
enough
to
kill
him
and
she
would
go
to
the
bed
to
she
would
take
her
by
the
arm
and
say
yes
it
me
this
is
for
your
life
and
over
her
face
her
throat
her
skin
over
everything
about
her
that
was
youthful
and
attractive
and
that
invited
love
germinie
watched
the
vitriol
sear
and
seam
and
burn
and
hiss
transforming
her
into
a
horrible
object
that
filled
germinie
heart
to
overflowing
with
joy
the
bottle
was
empty
and
she
laughed
and
in
her
frightful
dream
her
body
also
dreaming
her
feet
began
to
move
she
walked
unconsciously
down
the
passage
into
the
street
and
to
a
shop
ten
minutes
she
stood
motionless
at
the
counter
with
eyes
that
did
not
see
the
vacant
wandering
eyes
of
one
who
has
murder
in
his
heart
well
well
what
do
you
want
said
the
grocer
wife
testily
almost
frightened
by
the
bearing
of
this
woman
who
did
not
stir
what
do
i
want
said
germinie
she
was
so
filled
so
possessed
with
the
thought
of
what
she
wanted
that
she
believed
she
had
asked
for
vitriol
what
do
i
want
she
passed
her
hand
across
her
ah
i
do
know
now
and
she
left
the
shop
stumbling
as
she
went
xxxiii
in
the
torment
of
the
life
she
was
leading
in
which
she
suffered
the
horrors
of
death
and
of
unsatisfied
passion
germinie
seeking
to
deaden
her
ghastly
thoughts
had
remembered
the
glass
she
had
taken
from
adèle
hand
one
morning
which
gave
her
a
whole
day
of
oblivion
from
that
day
she
had
taken
to
drink
she
had
begun
with
the
little
morning
draughts
to
which
the
maids
of
kept
women
are
addicted
she
had
drunk
with
this
one
and
with
that
one
she
had
drunk
with
men
who
came
to
breakfast
at
the
creamery
she
had
drunk
with
adèle
who
drank
like
a
man
and
who
took
a
base
delight
in
seeing
this
virtuous
woman
maid
descend
as
low
as
herself
at
first
she
had
needed
excitement
company
the
clinking
of
glasses
the
encouragement
of
speech
the
inspiration
of
the
challenge
in
order
to
arouse
the
desire
to
drink
but
she
had
soon
reached
the
point
where
she
drank
alone
then
it
was
that
she
began
to
carry
home
a
glass
under
her
apron
and
hide
it
in
a
corner
of
the
kitchen
that
she
had
taken
to
drinking
those
mixtures
of
white
wine
and
brandy
of
which
she
would
take
draught
upon
draught
until
she
had
found
that
for
which
she
thirsted
sleep
for
what
she
craved
was
not
the
fevered
brain
the
happy
confusion
the
living
folly
the
delirious
waking
dream
of
drunkenness
what
she
needed
what
she
sought
was
the
negative
joy
of
sleep
lethean
dreamless
sleep
a
leaden
sleep
falling
upon
her
like
the
blow
of
the
sledge
upon
the
ox
head
and
she
found
it
in
those
compounds
which
struck
her
down
and
stretched
her
out
face
downward
on
the
waxed
cover
of
the
kitchen
table
to
sleep
that
overpowering
sleep
to
wallow
by
day
in
that
midnight
darkness
had
come
to
mean
to
her
a
truce
deliverance
from
an
existence
that
she
had
not
the
courage
to
continue
or
to
end
an
overwhelming
longing
for
oblivion
was
all
she
felt
when
she
awoke
the
hours
of
her
life
that
she
passed
in
possession
of
her
faculties
contemplating
herself
examining
her
conscience
looking
on
at
her
own
shame
seemed
to
her
so
execrable
she
preferred
to
kill
them
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
but
sleep
to
make
her
forget
everything
the
congested
sleep
of
intoxication
which
lulls
its
victim
with
the
arms
of
death
in
that
glass
from
which
she
forced
herself
to
drink
and
which
she
emptied
in
a
sort
of
frenzy
her
sufferings
her
sorrows
all
her
horrible
present
would
be
drowned
and
disappear
in
a
half
hour
her
mind
would
have
ceased
to
think
her
life
would
have
ceased
to
exist
nothing
of
her
surroundings
would
have
any
being
for
her
there
would
be
no
more
time
even
so
far
as
she
was
concerned
i
drink
away
my
troubles
she
said
to
a
woman
who
told
her
that
she
would
wreck
her
health
by
drinking
and
as
in
the
periods
of
reaction
that
followed
her
debauches
there
came
to
her
a
more
painful
feeling
of
her
own
shame
a
greater
sense
of
desolation
and
a
fiercer
detestation
of
her
mistakes
and
her
sins
she
sought
stronger
decoctions
of
alcohol
more
fiery
brandy
and
even
drank
pure
absinthe
in
order
to
produce
a
more
deathly
lethargy
and
to
make
her
more
utterly
oblivious
to
everything
she
ended
by
attaining
in
this
way
whole
half
days
of
unconsciousness
from
which
she
emerged
only
half
awake
with
benumbed
intelligence
blunted
perceptions
hands
that
did
things
by
force
of
habit
the
motions
of
a
somnambulist
a
body
and
a
mind
in
which
thought
will
memory
seemed
still
to
retain
the
drowsiness
and
vagueness
of
the
confused
waking
hours
of
the
morning
xxxiv
half
an
hour
after
the
horrible
meeting
when
her
mind
having
dabbled
in
crime
as
if
with
her
fingers
she
had
determined
to
disfigure
her
rival
with
vitriol
and
had
believed
that
she
had
done
so
germinie
returned
to
rue
de
laval
with
a
bottle
of
brandy
procured
at
the
grocer
for
two
weeks
she
had
been
mistress
of
the
apartment
free
to
indulge
her
brutish
appetite
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
who
as
a
general
rule
hardly
stirred
from
her
chair
had
gone
strangely
enough
to
pass
six
weeks
with
an
old
friend
in
the
country
and
she
decided
not
to
take
germinie
with
her
for
fear
of
setting
a
bad
example
to
the
other
servants
and
arousing
their
jealousy
of
a
maid
who
was
accustomed
to
very
light
duties
and
was
treated
on
a
different
footing
from
themselves
germinie
went
into
mademoiselle
bedroom
and
took
no
more
time
than
was
necessary
to
throw
her
shawl
and
hat
on
the
floor
before
she
began
to
drink
with
the
neck
of
the
bottle
between
her
teeth
pouring
down
the
liquid
hurriedly
until
everything
in
the
room
was
whirling
around
her
and
she
remembered
nothing
of
the
day
thereupon
staggering
feeling
that
she
was
about
to
fall
she
tried
to
throw
herself
on
her
bed
to
sleep
but
her
dizziness
threw
her
against
the
night
table
from
that
she
fell
to
the
floor
and
lay
without
moving
she
simply
snored
but
the
blow
was
so
violent
that
during
the
night
she
had
a
miscarriage
followed
by
one
of
those
hemorrhages
in
which
the
life
often
ebbs
away
she
tried
to
rise
and
go
out
on
the
landing
to
call
she
tried
to
stand
up
she
could
not
she
felt
that
she
was
gliding
on
to
death
entering
its
portals
and
descending
with
gentle
moderation
at
last
summoning
all
her
strength
for
a
final
effort
she
dragged
herself
as
far
as
the
hall
door
but
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
lift
her
head
to
the
keyhole
impossible
to
cry
out
and
she
would
have
died
where
she
lay
had
not
adèle
as
she
was
passing
in
the
morning
heard
a
groan
and
in
her
alarm
fetched
a
locksmith
to
open
the
door
and
afterward
a
midwife
to
attend
to
the
dying
woman
when
mademoiselle
returned
a
month
later
she
found
germinie
up
and
about
but
so
weak
that
she
was
constantly
obliged
to
sit
down
and
so
pale
that
she
seemed
to
have
no
blood
left
in
her
body
they
told
her
that
she
had
had
a
hemorrhage
of
which
she
nearly
died
mademoiselle
suspected
nothing
xxxv
germinie
welcomed
mademoiselle
return
with
melting
caresses
wet
with
tears
her
affectionate
manner
was
like
a
sick
child
she
had
the
same
clinging
gentleness
the
imploring
expression
the
melancholy
of
timid
frightened
suffering
she
sought
excuses
for
touching
her
mistress
with
her
white
hands
she
approached
her
with
a
sort
of
trembling
and
fervent
humility
very
often
as
she
sat
facing
her
upon
a
stool
and
looked
up
at
her
with
eyes
like
a
dog
she
would
rise
and
go
and
kiss
some
part
of
her
dress
then
resume
her
seat
and
in
a
moment
begin
again
there
was
entreaty
in
these
caresses
these
kisses
of
germinie
death
whose
footsteps
she
had
heard
approaching
her
as
if
it
were
a
living
person
the
hours
of
utter
prostration
when
as
she
lay
in
her
bed
alone
with
herself
she
had
reviewed
her
whole
past
life
the
consciousness
of
the
shame
of
all
she
had
concealed
from
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
the
fear
of
a
judgment
of
god
rising
from
the
depths
of
her
former
religious
ideas
all
the
reproaches
all
the
apprehensions
that
whisper
in
the
ear
of
a
dying
agony
had
aroused
a
horrible
dread
in
her
conscience
and
remorse
the
remorse
that
she
had
never
been
able
to
put
down
was
now
alive
and
crying
aloud
in
her
enfeebled
broken
body
as
yet
but
partially
restored
to
life
as
yet
scarcely
firm
in
the
persuasion
that
it
was
alive
germinie
was
not
one
of
those
fortunate
natures
that
do
wrong
and
leave
the
memory
of
it
behind
them
and
never
feel
a
twinge
of
regret
she
had
not
like
adèle
one
of
those
vulgar
material
organizations
which
never
allow
themselves
to
be
affected
by
any
but
animal
impulses
she
was
not
blessed
with
one
of
those
consciences
which
escape
suffering
by
virtue
of
mere
brutishness
or
of
that
dense
stupidity
in
which
a
woman
vegetates
sinning
because
she
knows
no
better
in
her
case
an
unhealthy
sensitiveness
a
sort
of
cerebral
excitement
a
disposition
on
the
part
of
the
brain
to
be
always
on
the
alert
to
work
itself
into
a
frenzy
of
bitterness
anxiety
and
discontent
with
itself
a
moral
sense
that
stood
erect
as
it
were
after
every
one
of
her
backslidings
all
the
characteristics
of
a
sensitive
mind
predestined
to
misfortune
united
to
torture
her
and
to
renew
day
after
day
more
openly
and
more
cruelly
in
her
despair
the
agony
due
to
acts
that
would
hardly
have
caused
such
suffering
in
many
women
in
her
station
germinie
yielded
to
the
impulse
of
passion
but
as
soon
as
she
had
yielded
to
it
she
despised
herself
even
in
the
excitement
of
pleasure
she
could
not
entirely
forget
and
lose
herself
the
image
of
mademoiselle
always
arose
before
her
with
her
stern
motherly
face
germinie
did
not
become
immodest
in
the
same
degree
that
she
abandoned
herself
to
her
passions
and
sank
lower
and
lower
in
vice
the
degrading
depths
to
which
she
descended
did
not
fortify
her
against
her
disgust
and
horror
of
herself
habit
did
not
harden
her
her
defiled
conscience
rejected
its
defilement
struggled
fiercely
in
its
shame
rent
itself
in
its
repentance
and
did
not
for
one
second
permit
itself
the
full
enjoyment
of
vice
was
never
completely
stunned
by
its
fall
and
so
when
mademoiselle
forgetting
that
she
was
a
servant
leaned
over
to
her
with
the
brusque
familiarity
of
tone
and
gesture
that
went
straight
to
her
heart
germinie
confused
and
overcome
with
blushing
timidity
was
speechless
and
seemed
bereft
of
sense
under
the
horrible
torture
caused
by
the
consciousness
of
her
own
unworthiness
she
would
fly
from
the
room
she
would
invent
some
pretext
to
escape
from
that
affection
which
she
so
shamefully
betrayed
and
which
when
it
touched
her
stirred
her
remorse
to
shuddering
activity
xxxvi
the
miraculous
part
of
this
disorderly
abandoned
life
this
life
of
shame
and
misery
was
that
it
did
not
become
known
germinie
allowed
no
trace
of
anything
to
appear
outside
she
allowed
nothing
to
rise
to
her
lips
nothing
to
be
seen
in
her
face
nothing
to
be
noticed
in
her
manner
and
the
accursed
background
of
her
existence
remained
hidden
from
her
mistress
it
had
indeed
sometimes
occurred
to
mademoiselle
in
a
vague
way
that
her
maid
had
some
secret
something
that
she
was
concealing
from
her
something
that
was
obscure
in
her
life
she
had
had
moments
of
doubt
of
suspicion
an
instinctive
feeling
of
uneasiness
confused
glimpses
of
something
wrong
a
faint
scent
that
eluded
her
and
vanished
in
the
gloom
she
had
thought
at
times
that
she
had
stumbled
upon
sealed
unresponsive
recesses
in
the
girl
heart
upon
a
mystery
upon
some
unlighted
passage
of
her
life
again
at
times
it
had
seemed
to
her
that
her
maid
eyes
did
not
say
what
her
mouth
said
involuntarily
she
had
remembered
a
phrase
that
germinie
often
repeated
a
sin
hidden
a
sin
half
forgiven
but
the
thing
that
filled
her
thoughts
above
all
else
was
amazement
that
germinie
despite
the
increase
in
her
wages
and
the
little
gifts
that
she
gave
her
almost
every
day
never
purchased
anything
for
her
toilet
had
no
new
dresses
or
linen
where
did
her
money
go
she
had
almost
admitted
having
withdrawn
her
eighteen
hundred
francs
from
the
savings
bank
mademoiselle
ruminated
over
it
then
said
to
herself
that
that
was
the
whole
of
her
maid
mystery
it
was
about
money
she
was
short
of
funds
doubtless
on
account
of
some
obligations
she
had
entered
into
long
ago
for
her
family
and
perhaps
she
had
been
sending
more
money
to
her
of
a
she
was
so
and
had
so
little
system
she
had
so
little
idea
of
the
value
of
a
piece
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
mademoiselle
was
sure
of
it
and
as
she
knew
the
girl
obstinate
nature
and
had
no
hope
of
inducing
her
to
change
her
mind
she
said
nothing
to
her
if
this
explanation
did
not
fully
satisfy
mademoiselle
she
attributed
what
there
was
strange
and
mysterious
in
her
maid
behavior
to
her
somewhat
secretive
nature
which
retained
something
of
the
characteristic
distrust
of
the
peasant
who
is
jealous
of
her
own
petty
affairs
and
takes
delight
in
burying
a
corner
of
her
life
away
down
in
her
heart
as
the
villager
hoards
his
sous
in
a
woolen
stocking
or
else
she
persuaded
herself
that
it
was
her
ill
health
her
state
of
continual
suffering
that
was
responsible
for
her
whims
and
her
habit
of
dissimulation
and
her
mind
in
its
interested
search
for
motives
stopped
at
that
point
with
the
indolence
and
a
little
of
the
selfishness
of
old
minds
who
having
an
instinctive
dread
of
final
results
and
of
the
real
characters
of
their
acquaintances
prefer
not
to
be
too
inquisitive
or
to
know
too
much
who
knows
perhaps
all
this
mystery
was
nothing
but
a
paltry
matter
unworthy
to
disturb
or
to
interest
her
some
petty
woman
quarrel
she
went
to
sleep
thereupon
reassured
and
ceased
to
cudgel
her
brains
in
truth
how
could
mademoiselle
have
guessed
germinie
degradation
and
the
horror
of
her
secret
in
her
most
poignant
suffering
in
her
wildest
intoxication
the
unhappy
creature
retained
the
incredible
strength
necessary
to
suppress
and
keep
back
everything
from
her
passionate
overcharged
nature
which
found
relief
so
naturally
in
expansion
never
a
word
escaped
or
a
syllable
that
cast
a
ray
of
light
upon
her
secret
mortification
contempt
disappointment
the
death
of
her
child
the
treachery
of
her
lover
the
dying
agony
of
her
love
all
remained
voiceless
within
her
as
if
she
stifled
their
cries
by
pressing
her
hands
upon
her
heart
her
rare
attacks
of
weakness
when
she
seemed
to
be
struggling
with
pains
that
strangled
her
the
fierce
feverish
caresses
lavished
upon
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
the
sudden
paroxysms
as
if
she
were
trying
to
give
birth
to
something
always
ended
without
words
and
found
relief
in
tears
even
illness
with
its
resulting
weakness
and
enervation
forced
nothing
from
her
it
could
make
no
impression
on
that
heroic
resolution
to
keep
silent
to
the
end
hysterical
attacks
extorted
shrieks
from
her
and
nothing
but
shrieks
when
she
was
a
girl
she
dreamed
aloud
she
forced
her
dreams
to
cease
speaking
she
closed
the
lips
of
her
sleep
as
mademoiselle
might
have
discovered
from
her
breath
that
she
had
been
drinking
she
ate
shallots
and
garlic
and
concealed
the
fumes
of
liquor
with
their
offensive
odors
she
even
trained
her
intoxication
her
drunken
torpor
to
awake
at
her
mistress
footstep
and
remain
awake
in
her
presence
thus
she
led
as
it
were
two
lives
she
was
like
two
women
and
by
dint
of
energy
adroitness
and
feminine
diplomacy
with
a
that
never
failed
her
even
in
the
mental
confusion
caused
by
drink
she
succeeded
in
separating
those
two
existences
in
living
them
both
without
mingling
them
in
never
allowing
the
two
women
that
lived
in
her
to
be
confounded
with
each
other
in
continuing
to
be
with
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
the
virtuous
respectable
girl
she
had
been
in
emerging
from
her
orgies
without
carrying
away
the
taste
of
them
in
displaying
when
she
left
her
lover
a
sort
of
modesty
shocked
by
the
scandalous
courses
of
other
maids
she
never
uttered
a
word
or
bore
herself
in
a
way
to
arouse
a
suspicion
of
her
clandestine
life
nothing
about
her
conveyed
a
hint
as
to
the
way
her
nights
were
passed
when
she
placed
her
foot
upon
the
outside
mademoiselle
de
apartments
when
she
approached
her
when
she
stood
before
her
she
adopted
the
tone
and
the
attitude
even
to
a
certain
way
of
holding
the
dress
which
relieve
a
woman
from
so
much
as
a
suspicion
of
having
aught
to
do
with
men
she
talked
freely
upon
all
subjects
as
if
she
had
nothing
to
blush
for
she
spoke
with
bitterness
of
the
misdoings
and
shame
of
others
as
if
she
were
herself
beyond
reproach
she
joked
with
her
mistress
about
love
in
a
jovial
unembarrassed
indifferent
tone
to
hear
her
you
would
have
thought
she
was
talking
of
an
old
acquaintance
of
whom
she
had
lost
sight
and
in
the
eyes
of
all
those
who
saw
her
only
as
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
did
and
at
her
home
there
was
a
certain
atmosphere
of
chastity
about
her
years
the
odor
of
stern
unimpeachable
virtue
peculiar
to
and
plain
women
and
yet
all
this
falsehood
in
the
matter
of
appearances
was
not
hypocrisy
in
germinie
it
did
not
arise
from
downright
duplicity
from
corrupt
striving
for
effect
it
was
her
affection
for
mademoiselle
that
made
her
what
she
was
with
her
she
was
determined
at
any
price
to
save
her
the
grief
of
seeing
her
as
she
was
of
going
to
the
bottom
of
her
character
she
deceived
her
solely
in
order
to
retain
her
affection
with
a
sort
of
respect
and
a
feeling
of
veneration
almost
of
piety
stole
into
the
ghastly
comedy
she
was
playing
like
the
feeling
a
girl
has
who
lies
to
her
mother
in
order
not
to
rend
her
heart
xxxvii
to
lie
nothing
was
left
for
her
but
that
she
felt
that
it
was
an
impossibility
to
draw
back
from
her
present
position
she
did
not
even
entertain
the
idea
of
an
attempt
to
escape
from
it
it
seemed
such
a
hopeless
task
she
was
so
cowardly
so
crushed
and
degraded
and
she
felt
that
she
was
still
so
firmly
bound
to
that
man
by
all
sorts
of
vile
degrading
chains
even
by
the
contempt
that
he
no
longer
tried
to
conceal
from
her
sometimes
as
she
reflected
upon
her
plight
she
was
dismayed
the
simple
ideas
and
terrors
of
the
peasantry
recurred
to
her
mind
and
the
superstitions
of
her
youth
whispered
to
her
that
the
man
had
cast
a
spell
upon
her
that
he
had
perhaps
given
her
enchanted
bread
to
eat
otherwise
would
she
have
been
what
she
was
would
she
have
felt
at
the
mere
sight
of
him
that
thrill
of
emotion
through
her
whole
frame
that
almost
sensation
of
the
approach
of
a
master
would
she
have
felt
her
whole
body
her
mouth
her
arms
her
loving
and
caressing
gestures
involuntarily
go
out
to
him
would
she
have
belonged
to
him
so
absolutely
long
and
bitterly
she
dwelt
upon
all
that
should
have
cured
her
rescued
her
the
man
disdain
his
insults
the
degrading
concessions
he
had
forced
from
her
and
she
was
compelled
to
admit
that
there
had
been
nothing
too
precious
for
her
to
sacrifice
to
him
and
that
for
him
she
had
swallowed
the
things
she
loathed
most
bitterly
she
tried
to
imagine
the
degree
of
degradation
to
which
her
love
would
refuse
to
descend
and
she
could
conceive
of
none
he
could
do
what
he
chose
with
her
insult
her
beat
her
and
she
would
remain
under
his
heel
she
could
not
think
of
herself
as
not
belonging
to
him
she
could
not
think
of
herself
without
him
to
have
that
man
to
love
was
necessary
to
her
existence
she
derived
warmth
from
him
she
lived
by
him
she
breathed
him
there
seemed
to
be
no
parallel
case
to
hers
among
the
women
of
her
condition
whom
she
knew
no
one
of
her
comrades
carried
into
a
the
intensity
the
bitterness
the
torture
the
enjoyment
of
suffering
that
she
found
in
hers
no
one
of
them
carried
into
it
that
which
was
killing
her
and
which
she
could
not
dispense
with
to
herself
she
appeared
an
extraordinary
creature
of
an
exceptional
nature
with
the
temperament
of
animals
whom
binds
the
closer
to
their
masters
there
were
days
when
she
did
not
know
herself
and
when
she
wondered
if
she
were
still
the
same
woman
as
she
went
over
in
her
mind
all
the
base
deeds
to
which
jupillon
had
induced
her
to
stoop
she
could
not
believe
that
it
was
really
she
who
had
submitted
to
it
had
she
violent
and
impulsive
as
she
knew
herself
to
be
boiling
over
with
fiery
passions
rebellious
and
hotheaded
exhibited
such
docility
and
resignation
she
had
repressed
her
wrath
forced
back
the
murderous
thoughts
that
had
crowded
to
her
brain
so
many
times
she
had
always
obeyed
always
possessed
her
soul
in
patience
always
hung
her
head
she
had
forced
her
nature
her
instincts
her
pride
her
vanity
and
more
than
all
else
her
jealousy
the
fierce
passions
of
her
heart
to
crawl
at
that
man
feet
for
the
sake
of
keeping
him
she
had
stooped
to
share
him
to
allow
him
to
have
mistresses
to
receive
him
from
the
hands
of
others
to
seek
a
part
of
his
cheek
on
which
his
cousin
had
not
kissed
him
and
now
after
all
these
sacrifices
with
which
she
had
wearied
him
she
retained
her
hold
upon
him
by
a
still
more
distasteful
sacrifice
she
drew
him
to
her
by
gifts
she
opened
her
purse
to
him
to
induce
him
to
keep
appointments
with
her
she
purchased
his
by
gratifying
his
whims
and
his
caprices
she
paid
this
brute
who
haggled
over
the
price
of
his
kisses
and
demanded
of
love
and
she
lived
from
day
to
day
in
constant
dread
of
what
the
miserable
villain
would
demand
of
her
on
the
morrow
xxxviii
he
must
have
twenty
francs
germinie
mechanically
repeated
the
sentence
to
herself
several
times
but
her
thoughts
did
not
go
beyond
the
words
she
uttered
the
walk
and
the
climb
up
five
flights
of
stairs
had
made
her
dizzy
she
fell
in
a
sitting
posture
on
the
greasy
couch
in
the
kitchen
hung
her
head
and
laid
her
arms
on
the
table
her
ears
were
ringing
her
ideas
went
and
came
in
a
disorderly
throng
stifling
one
another
in
her
brain
and
of
them
all
but
one
remained
more
and
more
distinct
and
persistent
he
must
have
twenty
francs
twenty
francs
twenty
francs
and
she
looked
as
if
she
expected
to
find
them
somewhere
there
in
the
fireplace
in
the
under
the
stove
then
she
thought
of
the
people
who
owed
her
of
a
german
maid
who
had
promised
to
repay
her
more
than
a
year
before
she
rose
and
tied
her
capstrings
she
no
longer
said
he
must
have
twenty
francs
she
said
i
will
get
them
she
went
down
to
adèle
you
have
twenty
francs
for
a
note
that
just
came
have
you
mademoiselle
has
gone
out
nothing
here
said
adèle
i
gave
madame
my
last
twenty
francs
last
night
to
get
her
supper
the
jade
has
come
back
yet
will
you
have
thirty
sous
she
ran
to
the
grocer
it
was
sunday
and
three
in
the
afternoon
the
grocer
had
closed
his
shop
there
were
a
number
of
people
at
the
fruitwoman
she
asked
for
four
sous
worth
of
herbs
i
have
any
money
said
she
she
hoped
that
the
woman
would
say
do
you
want
some
instead
of
that
she
said
what
an
idea
as
if
i
was
afraid
of
you
there
were
other
maids
there
so
she
went
out
without
saying
anything
more
is
there
anything
for
us
she
said
to
the
concierge
ah
by
the
way
my
pipelet
you
do
happen
to
have
twenty
francs
about
you
do
you
it
will
save
my
going
way
again
forty
if
you
want
she
breathed
freely
the
concierge
went
to
a
desk
at
the
back
of
the
lodge
my
wife
has
taken
the
key
why
how
pale
you
are
it
is
anything
and
she
rushed
out
into
the
courtyard
toward
the
door
of
the
servant
staircase
this
is
what
she
thought
as
she
went
there
are
people
who
find
pieces
he
needed
them
he
told
me
mademoiselle
gave
me
my
money
not
five
days
ago
and
i
ca
ask
her
after
all
what
are
twenty
francs
more
or
less
to
her
the
grocer
would
surely
have
lent
them
to
me
i
had
another
grocer
on
rue
taitbout
he
did
close
till
evening
sundays
she
was
in
front
of
her
own
door
she
leaned
over
the
rail
of
the
other
staircase
looked
to
see
if
anyone
was
coming
up
entered
her
room
went
straight
to
mademoiselle
bedchamber
opened
the
window
and
breathed
long
and
hard
with
her
elbows
on
the
sparrows
hastened
to
her
from
the
neighboring
chimneys
thinking
that
she
was
going
to
toss
bread
to
them
she
closed
the
window
and
glanced
at
the
top
of
the
commode
first
at
a
vein
of
marble
then
at
a
little
box
then
at
the
key
a
small
steel
key
left
in
the
lock
suddenly
there
was
a
ringing
in
her
ears
she
thought
that
the
bell
rang
she
ran
and
opened
the
door
there
was
no
one
there
she
returned
with
the
certainty
that
she
was
alone
went
to
the
kitchen
for
a
cloth
and
began
to
rub
a
mahogany
armchair
turning
her
back
to
the
commode
but
she
could
still
see
the
box
she
could
see
it
lying
open
she
could
see
the
coins
at
the
right
where
mademoiselle
kept
her
gold
the
papers
in
which
she
wrapped
it
a
hundred
francs
in
each
her
twenty
francs
were
there
she
closed
her
eyes
as
if
the
light
dazzled
them
she
felt
a
dizziness
in
her
conscience
but
immediately
her
whole
being
rose
in
revolt
against
her
and
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
her
heart
in
its
indignation
rose
to
her
throat
in
an
instant
the
honor
of
her
whole
life
stood
erect
between
her
hand
and
that
key
her
upright
unselfish
devoted
past
twenty
years
of
resistance
to
the
evil
counsels
and
the
corruption
of
that
foul
quarter
twenty
years
of
scorn
for
theft
twenty
years
in
which
her
pocket
had
not
held
back
a
sou
from
her
employers
twenty
years
of
indifference
to
gain
twenty
years
in
which
temptation
had
never
come
near
her
her
long
maintained
and
natural
virtue
confidence
in
her
all
these
things
came
to
her
mind
in
a
single
instant
her
youthful
years
clung
to
her
and
took
possession
of
her
from
her
family
from
the
memory
of
her
parents
from
the
unsullied
reputation
of
her
wretched
name
from
the
dead
from
whom
she
was
descended
there
arose
a
murmur
as
of
guardian
angels
hovering
about
her
for
one
second
she
was
saved
and
then
insensibly
evil
thoughts
glided
one
by
one
into
her
brain
she
sought
for
subjects
of
bitterness
for
excuses
for
ingratitude
to
her
mistress
she
compared
with
her
own
wages
the
wages
of
which
the
other
maids
in
the
house
boasted
vaingloriously
she
concluded
that
mademoiselle
was
very
fortunate
to
have
her
in
her
service
and
that
she
should
have
increased
her
wages
more
since
she
had
been
with
her
and
then
she
suddenly
asked
herself
why
does
she
leave
the
key
in
her
box
and
she
began
to
reflect
thereupon
that
the
money
in
the
box
was
not
used
for
living
expenses
but
had
been
laid
aside
by
mademoiselle
to
buy
a
velvet
dress
for
a
sleeping
money
she
said
to
herself
she
marshaled
her
reasons
with
precipitation
as
if
to
make
it
impossible
to
discuss
them
and
then
it
only
for
once
she
would
lend
them
to
me
if
i
asked
her
and
i
will
return
them
she
put
out
her
hand
and
turned
the
key
she
stopped
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
intense
silence
round
about
was
listening
to
her
and
looking
at
her
she
raised
her
eyes
the
mirror
threw
back
her
face
at
her
before
that
face
her
own
she
was
afraid
she
recoiled
in
terror
and
shame
as
if
before
the
face
of
her
crime
it
was
a
thief
head
that
she
had
upon
her
shoulders
she
fled
into
the
corridor
suddenly
she
turned
upon
her
heel
went
straight
to
the
box
turned
the
key
put
in
her
hand
fumbled
under
the
hair
trinkets
and
souvenirs
felt
in
a
roll
of
five
louis
and
took
out
one
piece
closed
the
box
and
rushed
into
the
kitchen
she
had
the
little
coin
in
her
hand
and
dared
not
look
at
it
xxxix
then
it
was
that
germinie
abasement
and
degradation
began
to
be
visible
in
her
personal
appearance
to
make
her
stupid
and
slovenly
a
sort
of
drowsiness
came
over
her
ideas
she
was
no
longer
keen
and
prompt
of
apprehension
what
she
had
read
and
what
she
had
learned
seemed
to
escape
her
her
memory
which
formerly
retained
everything
became
confused
and
unreliable
the
sharp
wit
of
the
parisian
gradually
vanished
from
her
conversation
her
retorts
her
laughter
her
face
once
so
animated
was
no
longer
lighted
up
by
gleams
of
intelligence
in
her
whole
person
you
would
have
said
that
she
had
become
once
more
the
stupid
peasant
girl
that
she
was
when
she
came
from
her
province
when
she
went
to
a
stationer
for
gingerbread
she
seemed
not
to
understand
as
mademoiselle
expressed
it
she
made
faces
like
an
idiot
she
was
obliged
to
explain
to
her
to
repeat
two
or
three
times
things
that
germinie
had
always
grasped
on
the
merest
hint
she
asked
herself
when
she
saw
how
slow
and
torpid
she
was
if
somebody
had
not
exchanged
her
maid
for
why
you
getting
to
be
a
perfect
imbecile
she
would
sometimes
say
to
her
testily
she
remembered
the
time
when
germinie
was
so
useful
about
finding
dates
writing
an
address
on
a
card
telling
her
what
day
they
had
put
in
the
wood
or
broached
the
cask
of
wine
all
of
which
were
things
that
her
old
brain
could
not
remember
now
germinie
remembered
nothing
in
the
evening
when
she
went
over
her
accounts
with
mademoiselle
she
could
not
think
what
she
had
bought
in
the
morning
she
would
say
wait
but
she
would
simply
pass
her
hand
vaguely
across
her
brow
nothing
would
come
to
her
mind
mademoiselle
to
save
her
tired
old
eyes
had
fallen
into
the
habit
of
having
germinie
read
the
newspaper
to
her
but
she
got
to
stumbling
so
and
reading
with
so
little
intelligence
that
mademoiselle
was
compelled
to
decline
her
services
with
thanks
as
her
faculties
failed
she
abandoned
and
neglected
her
body
in
a
like
degree
she
gave
no
thought
to
her
dress
nor
to
cleanliness
even
in
her
indifference
she
retained
nothing
of
a
woman
natural
solicitude
touching
her
personal
appearance
she
did
not
dress
decently
she
wore
dresses
spotted
with
grease
and
torn
under
the
arms
aprons
in
rags
worn
stockings
in
shoes
that
were
out
at
heel
she
allowed
the
cooking
the
smoke
the
coal
the
wax
to
soil
her
hands
and
face
and
simply
wiped
them
as
she
would
after
dusting
formerly
she
had
had
the
one
coquettish
and
luxurious
instinct
of
poor
women
a
love
for
clean
linen
no
one
in
the
house
had
fresher
caps
than
she
her
simple
little
collars
were
always
of
that
snowy
whiteness
that
lights
up
the
skin
so
prettily
and
makes
the
whole
person
clean
now
she
wore
frayed
dirty
caps
which
looked
as
if
she
had
slept
in
them
she
went
without
ruffles
her
collar
made
a
band
of
filth
against
the
skin
of
her
neck
and
you
felt
that
she
was
less
clean
beneath
than
above
an
odor
of
poverty
rank
and
musty
arose
from
her
sometimes
it
was
so
strong
that
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
could
not
refrain
from
saying
to
her
go
and
change
your
clothes
my
girl
you
smell
of
the
poor
in
the
street
she
no
longer
looked
as
if
she
belonged
to
any
respectable
person
she
had
not
the
appearance
of
a
virtuous
woman
maid
she
lost
the
aspect
of
a
servant
who
by
dint
of
displaying
her
and
even
in
her
garb
reflects
in
her
person
the
honor
and
the
pride
of
her
masters
from
day
to
day
she
sank
nearer
to
the
level
of
that
abject
shameless
creature
whose
dress
drags
in
the
gutter
a
dirty
slattern
as
she
neglected
herself
so
she
neglected
everything
about
her
she
kept
nothing
in
order
she
did
no
cleaning
or
washing
she
allowed
dirt
and
disorder
to
make
their
way
into
the
apartments
to
invade
mademoiselle
own
sanctum
with
whose
neatness
mademoiselle
was
formerly
so
well
pleased
and
so
proud
the
dust
collected
there
the
spiders
spun
their
webs
behind
the
frames
the
mirrors
were
as
if
covered
with
a
veil
the
marble
mantels
the
mahogany
furniture
lost
their
lustre
moths
flew
up
from
the
carpets
which
were
never
shaken
worms
ensconced
themselves
where
the
brush
and
broom
no
longer
came
to
disturb
them
neglect
spread
a
film
of
dust
over
all
the
sleeping
neglected
objects
that
were
formerly
awakened
and
enlivened
every
morning
by
the
maid
active
hand
a
dozen
times
mademoiselle
had
tried
to
spur
germinie
to
action
but
thereupon
for
a
whole
day
there
was
such
a
frantic
scrubbing
accompanied
by
such
gusts
of
that
mademoiselle
would
take
an
oath
never
to
try
again
one
day
however
she
made
bold
to
write
germinie
name
with
her
finger
in
the
dust
on
her
mirror
germinie
did
not
forgive
her
for
a
week
at
last
mademoiselle
became
resigned
she
hardly
ventured
to
remark
mildly
when
she
saw
that
her
maid
was
in
good
humor
confess
germinie
that
the
dust
is
very
well
treated
with
us
to
the
wondering
observations
of
the
friends
who
still
came
to
see
her
and
whom
germinie
was
forced
to
admit
mademoiselle
would
reply
in
a
compassionate
sympathetic
tone
yes
it
is
filthy
i
know
but
what
can
you
expect
germinie
sick
and
i
prefer
that
she
should
kill
herself
sometimes
when
germinie
had
gone
out
she
would
venture
to
rub
a
cloth
over
a
commode
or
touch
a
frame
with
the
duster
with
her
gouty
hands
she
would
do
it
hurriedly
afraid
of
being
scolded
of
having
a
scene
if
the
maid
should
return
and
detect
her
germinie
did
almost
no
work
she
barely
served
mademoiselle
meals
she
had
reduced
her
mistress
breakfast
and
dinner
to
the
simplest
dishes
those
which
she
could
cook
most
easily
and
quickly
she
made
her
bed
without
raising
the
mattress
the
servant
that
she
had
been
was
not
to
be
recognized
in
her
did
not
exist
in
her
except
on
the
days
when
mademoiselle
gave
a
small
dinner
party
the
number
of
covers
being
always
considerable
on
account
of
the
party
of
children
invited
on
those
days
germinie
emerged
as
if
by
enchantment
from
her
indolence
and
apathy
and
putting
forth
a
sort
of
feverish
strength
she
recovered
all
her
former
energy
in
face
of
her
ovens
and
the
lengthened
table
and
mademoiselle
was
dumfounded
to
see
her
all
by
herself
declining
assistance
and
capable
of
anything
prepare
in
a
few
hours
a
dinner
for
half
a
score
of
persons
serve
it
and
clear
the
table
afterwards
with
the
nimble
hands
and
all
the
quick
dexterity
of
her
youth
xl
no
not
this
time
no
said
germinie
rising
from
the
foot
of
jupillon
bed
where
she
was
sitting
there
no
way
why
you
know
perfectly
well
that
i
have
a
sou
anything
you
can
call
a
sou
seen
the
stockings
i
wear
have
you
she
lifted
her
skirt
and
showed
him
her
stockings
all
full
of
holes
and
tied
together
with
strings
i
have
a
change
of
anything
money
why
i
did
even
have
enough
to
give
mademoiselle
a
few
flowers
on
her
birthday
i
bought
her
a
bunch
of
violets
for
a
sou
oh
yes
money
indeed
that
last
twenty
francs
do
you
know
where
i
got
them
i
took
them
out
of
mademoiselle
box
i
put
them
back
but
that
done
with
i
do
want
any
more
of
that
kind
of
thing
it
will
do
for
once
where
do
you
expect
me
to
get
money
now
just
tell
me
that
will
you
you
ca
pawn
your
skin
at
the
unless
but
as
to

of
that
sort

in
my
life
whatever
else

choose
but
no
stealing
i
wo
do
it
again
oh
i
know
very
well
what
you
will
do
so
much
the
worse
well

worked
yourself
up
enough
said
jupillon
if
told
me
that
about
the
twenty
francs
do
you
suppose
i
have
taken
it
i
did
suppose
you
were
as
hard
up
as
all
that
i
saw
that
you
went
on
as
usual
i
fancied
it
would
put
you
out
to
lend
me
a
piece
and
i
have
returned
it
in
a
week
or
two
with
the
others
but

well
i
done
i
wo
ask
you
for
any
more
but
that
no
reason
we
should
quarrel
as
i
can
see
and
he
added
with
an
indefinable
glance
at
germinie
till
thursday
eh
till
thursday
said
germinie
desperately
she
longed
to
throw
herself
into
jupillon
arms
to
ask
his
pardon
for
her
poverty
to
say
to
him
you
see
i
ca
do
it
she
repeated
till
thursday
and
took
her
leave
when
on
thursday
she
knocked
at
the
door
of
jupillon
apartment
on
the
ground
floor
she
thought
she
heard
a
man
hurried
step
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
the
door
opened
before
her
stood
cousin
with
her
hair
in
a
net
wearing
a
red
jacket
and
slippers
and
with
the
costume
and
bearing
of
a
woman
who
is
at
home
in
a
man
house
her
belongings
were
tossed
about
here
and
there
germinie
saw
them
on
the
chairs
she
had
paid
for
whom
does
madame
wish
to
see
demanded
the
cousin
impudently
monsieur
jupillon
he
has
gone
out
i
wait
for
him
said
germinie
and
she
attempted
to
enter
the
other
room
you
wait
at
the
porter
lodge
then
and
the
cousin
barred
the
way
when
will
he
return
when
the
hens
have
teeth
said
the
girl
seriously
and
shut
the
door
in
her
face
well
this
is
just
what
i
expected
of
him
said
germinie
to
herself
as
she
walked
along
the
street
the
pavement
seemed
to
give
way
beneath
her
trembling
legs
xli
when
she
returned
that
evening
from
a
christening
dinner
which
she
had
been
unable
to
avoid
attending
mademoiselle
heard
talking
in
her
room
she
thought
that
there
was
someone
with
germinie
and
marveling
thereat
she
opened
the
door
in
the
dim
light
shed
by
an
untrimmed
smoking
candle
she
saw
nothing
at
first
but
upon
looking
more
closely
she
discovered
her
maid
lying
in
a
heap
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
germinie
was
talking
in
her
sleep
she
was
talking
with
a
strange
accent
that
caused
emotion
almost
fear
the
vague
solemnity
of
supernatural
things
a
breath
from
regions
beyond
this
life
arose
in
the
room
with
those
words
of
sleep
involuntary
fugitive
words
palpitating
as
if
a
soul
without
a
body
were
wandering
about
a
dead
man
lips
the
voice
was
slow
and
deep
and
had
a
sound
with
long
pauses
of
heavy
breathing
and
words
breathed
forth
like
sighs
with
now
and
then
a
vibrating
painful
note
that
went
to
the
heart
a
voice
laden
with
mystery
and
with
the
nervous
tremor
of
the
darkness
in
which
the
sleeper
seemed
to
be
groping
for
souvenirs
of
the
past
and
passing
her
hand
over
faces
oh
she
loved
me
dearly
mademoiselle
heard
her
say
and
if
he
had
not
died
we
should
be
very
happy
now
should
we
no
no
but
it
done
worse
luck
and
i
do
want
to
tell
of
it
the
words
were
followed
by
a
nervous
contraction
of
her
features
as
if
she
sought
to
seize
her
secret
on
the
edge
of
her
lips
and
force
it
back
mademoiselle
with
something
very
like
terror
leaned
over
the
poor
forlorn
body
powerless
to
direct
its
own
acts
to
which
the
past
returned
as
a
ghost
returns
to
a
deserted
house
she
listened
to
the
confessions
that
were
all
ready
to
rush
forth
but
were
instinctively
checked
to
the
unconscious
mind
that
spoke
without
restraint
to
the
voice
that
did
not
hear
itself
a
sensation
of
horror
came
over
her
she
felt
as
if
she
were
beside
a
dead
body
haunted
by
a
dream
after
a
pause
of
some
duration
and
what
seemed
to
be
a
sort
of
conflict
between
the
things
that
were
present
in
her
mind
germinie
apparently
turned
her
attention
to
the
circumstances
of
her
present
life
the
words
that
escaped
her
disjointed
incoherent
words
were
as
far
as
mademoiselle
could
understand
them
addressed
to
some
person
by
way
of
reproach
and
as
she
talked
on
her
language
became
as
unrecognizable
as
her
voice
which
had
taken
on
the
tone
and
accent
of
the
dreamer
it
rose
above
the
woman
above
her
ordinary
style
above
her
daily
expressions
it
was
the
language
of
the
people
purified
and
transfigured
by
passion
germinie
accentuated
words
according
to
their
orthography
she
uttered
them
with
all
their
eloquence
the
sentences
came
from
her
mouth
with
their
proper
rhythm
their
pathos
and
their
tears
as
from
the
mouth
of
an
admirable
actress
there
were
bursts
of
tenderness
interlarded
with
shrieks
then
there
were
outbreaks
of
rebellion
fierce
bursts
of
passion
and
the
most
extraordinary
biting
implacable
irony
always
merging
into
a
paroxysm
of
nervous
laughter
that
repeated
the
same
result
and
prolonged
it
from
echo
to
echo
mademoiselle
was
confounded
stupefied
and
listened
as
at
the
theatre
never
had
she
heard
disdain
hurled
down
from
so
lofty
a
height
contempt
so
tear
itself
to
tatters
and
gush
forth
in
laughter
a
woman
words
express
such
a
fierce
thirst
for
vengeance
against
a
man
she
ransacked
her
memory
such
play
of
feature
such
intonations
such
a
dramatic
and
voice
as
that
voice
of
a
consumptive
coughing
away
her
life
she
could
not
remember
since
the
days
of
mademoiselle
rachel
at
last
germinie
awoke
abruptly
her
eyes
filled
with
the
tears
of
her
dream
and
jumped
down
from
the
bed
seeing
that
her
mistress
had
returned
thanks
said
mademoiselle
do
disturb
yourself
wallow
about
on
my
bed
all
you
please
oh
mademoiselle
said
germinie
i
was
lying
where
you
put
your
head
i
have
made
it
nice
and
warm
for
your
feet
indeed
suppose
you
tell
me
what
you
been
dreaming
there
was
a
man
in
it
you
were
having
a
dispute
with
him
dream
said
germinie
i
do
remember
she
silently
set
about
undressing
her
mistress
trying
to
recall
her
dream
when
she
had
put
her
in
bed
she
said
drawing
near
to
her
ah
mademoiselle
wo
you
give
me
a
fortnight
for
once
to
go
home
i
remember
now
xlii
soon
after
this
mademoiselle
was
amazed
to
notice
an
entire
change
in
her
maid
manner
and
habits
germinie
no
longer
had
her
sullen
savage
moods
her
outbreaks
of
rebellion
her
fits
of
muttering
words
expressive
of
discontent
she
suddenly
threw
off
her
indolence
and
became
once
more
an
energetic
worker
she
no
longer
passed
hours
in
doing
her
marketing
she
seemed
to
avoid
the
street
she
ceased
to
go
out
in
the
evening
indeed
she
hardly
stirred
from
mademoiselle
side
hovering
about
her
and
watching
her
from
the
time
she
rose
in
the
morning
until
she
went
to
bed
at
night
lavishing
continuous
incessant
almost
irritating
attentions
upon
her
never
allowing
her
to
rise
or
even
to
put
out
her
hand
for
anything
waiting
upon
her
and
keeping
watch
of
her
as
if
she
were
a
child
at
times
mademoiselle
was
so
worn
out
with
her
so
weary
of
this
constant
fussing
about
her
person
that
she
would
open
her
mouth
to
say
come
come
are
you
almost
ready
to
clear
out
but
germinie
would
look
up
at
her
with
a
smile
a
smile
so
sad
and
sweet
that
it
checked
the
impatient
exclamation
on
the
old
maid
lips
and
so
she
stayed
on
with
her
going
about
with
a
sort
of
fascinated
divinely
stolid
air
in
the
impassibility
of
profound
adoration
buried
in
almost
idiotic
contemplation
at
that
period
all
the
poor
girl
affection
turned
to
mademoiselle
her
voice
her
gestures
her
eyes
her
silence
her
thoughts
went
out
to
her
mistress
with
the
fervor
of
expiation
with
the
contrition
of
a
prayer
the
rapt
intensity
of
a
cult
she
loved
her
with
all
the
loving
violence
of
her
nature
she
loved
her
with
all
the
deceptive
ardor
of
her
passion
she
strove
to
give
her
all
that
she
had
not
given
her
all
that
others
had
taken
from
her
every
day
her
love
clung
more
closely
more
devoutly
to
the
old
maid
who
was
conscious
of
being
enveloped
embraced
agreeably
warmed
by
the
heat
from
those
two
arms
that
were
thrown
about
her
old
age
xliii
but
the
past
and
its
debts
were
still
there
and
whispered
to
her
every
hour
if
mademoiselle
knew
she
lived
in
the
constant
panic
of
a
guilty
woman
trembling
with
dread
from
morning
till
night
there
was
never
a
ring
at
the
door
that
she
did
not
say
to
herself
it
has
come
at
last
letters
in
a
strange
handwriting
filled
her
with
anxiety
she
would
feel
of
the
wax
with
her
fingers
bury
the
letters
in
her
pocket
hesitate
about
delivering
them
and
the
moment
when
mademoiselle
unfolded
the
terrible
paper
and
scanned
its
contents
with
the
inexpressive
eye
of
elderly
people
was
as
full
of
suspense
to
her
as
if
she
were
awaiting
sentence
of
death
she
felt
that
her
secret
and
her
falsehood
were
in
everybody
hand
the
house
had
seen
her
and
might
speak
the
quarter
knew
her
as
she
was
of
all
about
her
there
was
no
one
but
her
mistress
whose
esteem
she
could
still
steal
as
she
went
in
and
out
the
concierge
looked
at
her
with
a
smile
and
a
glance
that
said
i
know
she
no
longer
dared
to
call
him
my
pipelet
when
she
returned
home
he
looked
into
her
basket
i
am
so
fond
of
that
his
wife
would
say
when
it
contained
some
tempting
morsel
at
night
she
would
take
down
what
was
left
she
ate
nothing
herself
she
ended
by
supplying
them
with
food
the
whole
street
frightened
her
no
less
than
the
hall
and
the
lodge
there
was
a
face
in
every
shop
that
reflected
her
shame
and
commented
on
her
sins
at
every
step
she
had
to
purchase
silence
by
groveling
humility
the
dealers
she
had
not
been
able
to
repay
had
her
in
their
clutches
if
she
said
that
anything
was
too
dear
she
was
reminded
in
a
bantering
way
that
they
were
her
masters
and
that
she
must
pay
the
price
unless
she
chose
to
be
denounced
a
jest
or
an
allusion
drove
the
color
from
her
cheeks
she
was
bound
to
them
compelled
to
trade
with
them
and
to
allow
them
to
empty
her
pockets
as
if
they
were
accomplices
the
successor
of
madame
jupillon
who
had
gone
into
the
grocery
business
at
aube
the
new
gave
her
bad
milk
and
when
she
suggested
that
mademoiselle
complained
about
it
and
that
she
was
found
fault
with
every
morning
the
woman
replied
much
you
care
for
your
mademoiselle
and
at
the
if
she
smelt
of
a
fish
and
said
this
has
been
frozen
the
reply
would
be
bah
tell
me
next
will
you
that
i
let
the
moon
shine
on
their
gills
so
to
make
look
fresh
so
these
are
hard
days
for
you
eh
my
duck
mademoiselle
wanted
her
to
go
to
the
one
day
for
her
dinner
and
she
mentioned
the
fact
in
the
presence
oho
yes
yes
to
the
i
like
to
see
you
go
to
the
and
she
bestowed
a
glance
upon
her
in
which
germinie
saw
a
threat
to
send
her
account
to
her
mistress
the
grocer
sold
her
coffee
that
smelt
of
snuff
rotten
prunes
dried
rice
and
old
biscuit
if
she
ventured
to
remonstrate
nonsense
he
would
say
an
old
customer
like
you
would
want
to
make
trouble
for
me
do
i
tell
you
i
give
you
good
weight
and
he
would
coolly
give
her
false
weight
of
the
goods
that
she
ordered
and
that
he
forced
her
to
order
xliv
it
was
a
very
great
trial
to
germinie
a
trial
that
she
sought
however
to
have
to
pass
through
a
street
where
there
was
a
school
for
young
girls
when
she
went
out
before
dinner
to
buy
an
evening
paper
for
mademoiselle
she
often
happened
to
be
at
the
door
when
the
school
was
dismissed
she
tried
to
run
away
and
stood
still
at
first
there
would
be
a
sound
like
that
made
by
a
swarm
of
bees
a
buzzing
and
humming
one
of
those
great
outbursts
of
childish
joy
that
wake
the
echoes
in
the
streets
of
paris
from
the
dark
and
narrow
passageway
leading
to
the
schoolroom
the
children
would
rush
forth
as
if
escaping
from
an
open
cage
and
run
about
and
frolic
in
the
sunlight
they
would
push
and
jostle
one
another
and
toss
their
empty
baskets
in
the
air
then
some
would
call
to
one
another
and
form
little
groups
tiny
hands
would
go
forth
to
meet
other
tiny
hands
friends
would
take
one
another
by
the
arm
or
put
their
arms
around
one
another
waists
or
necks
and
walk
along
nibbling
at
the
same
tart
soon
the
whole
band
would
be
in
motion
walking
slowly
up
the
filthy
street
with
loitering
step
the
larger
ones
ten
years
old
at
most
would
stop
and
talk
like
little
women
at
the
others
would
stop
to
drink
from
their
luncheon
bottles
the
smaller
ones
would
amuse
themselves
by
dipping
the
soles
of
their
shoes
in
the
gutter
and
there
were
some
who
made
a
headdress
of
a
cabbage
leaf
picked
up
from
the
ground
a
green
cap
sent
by
the
good
god
beneath
which
the
fresh
young
face
smiled
brightly
germinie
would
gaze
at
them
all
and
walk
along
with
them
she
would
go
in
among
them
in
order
to
feel
the
rustling
of
their
aprons
she
could
not
take
her
eyes
off
the
little
arms
under
which
the
school
satchels
leaped
about
the
little
dresses
the
little
black
leggings
the
little
legs
in
the
little
woolen
stockings
in
her
eyes
there
was
a
sort
of
divine
light
about
all
those
little
flaxen
heads
with
the
soft
hair
of
the
child
jesus
a
little
stray
lock
upon
a
little
neck
a
bit
of
baby
flesh
above
a
chemise
or
at
the
end
of
a
sleeve
at
times
she
saw
nothing
but
that
it
was
to
her
all
the
sunshine
of
the
street
and
the
sky
gradually
the
troop
dwindled
away
each
street
took
some
children
away
to
neighboring
streets
the
school
dispersed
along
the
road
the
gaiety
of
all
the
tiny
footsteps
died
away
little
by
little
the
little
dresses
disappeared
one
by
one
germinie
followed
the
last
she
attached
herself
to
those
who
went
the
farthest
on
one
occasion
as
she
was
walking
along
thus
devouring
with
her
eyes
the
memory
of
her
daughter
she
was
suddenly
seized
with
a
frenzied
longing
to
embrace
something
she
rushed
at
one
of
the
little
girls
and
grasped
her
arm
just
as
a
kidnapper
of
children
would
do
mamma
mamma
the
little
one
cried
and
wept
as
she
pulled
her
arm
away
germinie
fled
xlv
to
germinie
all
days
were
alike
equally
gloomy
and
desolate
she
had
reached
a
point
at
last
where
she
expected
nothing
from
chance
and
asked
nothing
from
the
unforeseen
her
life
seemed
to
her
to
be
forever
encaged
in
her
despair
it
would
always
be
the
same
implacable
thing
the
same
straight
monotonous
road
to
misfortune
the
same
dark
path
with
death
at
the
end
in
all
the
time
to
come
there
was
no
future
for
her
and
yet
in
the
depths
of
despair
in
which
she
was
crouching
thoughts
passed
through
her
mind
at
times
which
made
her
raise
her
head
and
look
before
her
to
a
point
beyond
the
present
at
times
the
illusion
of
a
last
hope
smiled
upon
her
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
might
even
yet
be
happy
and
that
if
certain
things
should
come
to
pass
she
would
be
thereupon
she
imagined
that
those
things
did
happen
she
arranged
incidents
and
catastrophes
she
linked
the
impossible
to
the
impossible
she
reconstructed
the
opportunities
of
her
life
and
her
fevered
hope
setting
about
the
task
of
creating
events
according
to
her
desire
on
the
horizon
of
the
future
soon
became
intoxicated
with
the
insane
vision
of
her
suppositions
then
the
delirious
hope
would
gradually
fade
away
she
would
tell
herself
that
it
was
impossible
that
nothing
of
what
she
dreamed
of
could
happen
and
she
would
sink
back
in
her
chair
and
think
after
a
moment
or
two
she
would
rise
and
walk
slowly
and
uncertainly
to
the
fireplace
toy
with
the
on
the
mantelpiece
and
at
last
decide
to
take
it
she
would
learn
what
the
rest
of
her
life
was
to
be
her
good
fortune
her
ill
fortune
everything
that
was
to
happen
to
her
was
there
in
that
device
of
the
woman
of
the
people
on
the
plate
on
which
she
was
about
to
pour
the
she
drained
the
water
from
the
grounds
waited
a
few
minutes
breathed
upon
them
with
the
religious
breath
with
which
her
lips
as
a
child
touched
the
paten
at
the
village
church
then
she
leaned
over
them
with
her
head
thrust
forward
terrifying
in
her
immobility
with
her
eyes
fixed
intently
upon
the
black
dust
scattered
in
patches
over
the
plate
she
sought
what
she
had
seen
find
in
the
granulations
and
the
almost
imperceptible
traces
left
by
the
coffee
as
it
trickled
away
she
fatigued
her
eyes
by
gazing
at
the
innumerable
little
spots
and
deciphered
shapes
and
letters
and
signs
therein
she
put
aside
some
grains
with
her
finger
in
order
to
see
them
more
clearly
and
more
sharply
defined
she
turned
the
plate
slowly
in
her
hands
this
way
and
that
questioned
its
mystery
on
all
sides
and
hunted
down
within
its
circular
rim
apparitions
images
rudiments
of
names
shadowy
initials
resemblances
to
different
people
rough
outlines
of
objects
omens
in
embryo
symbols
of
trifles
which
told
her
that
she
would
be
she
wanted
to
see
these
things
and
she
compelled
herself
to
discover
them
under
her
tense
gaze
the
porcelain
became
alive
with
the
visions
of
her
insomnia
her
disappointments
her
hatreds
the
faces
she
detested
arose
gradually
from
the
magic
plate
and
the
designs
drawn
thereon
by
chance
by
her
side
the
candle
which
she
forgot
to
snuff
gave
forth
an
intermittent
dying
light
it
sank
lower
and
lower
in
the
silence
night
came
on
apace
and
germinie
as
if
turned
to
stone
in
her
agony
always
remained
rooted
there
alone
and
face
to
face
with
her
fear
of
the
future
trying
to
decipher
in
the
dregs
of
the
coffee
the
confused
features
of
her
destiny
until
she
thought
she
could
detect
a
cross
beside
a
woman
who
resembled
jupillon
cousin
a
cross
that
is
to
say
speedy
xlvi
the
love
which
she
lacked
and
which
it
was
her
determination
to
deny
herself
became
the
torment
of
her
life
incessant
abominable
torture
she
had
to
defend
herself
against
the
fevers
of
her
body
and
the
irritations
from
without
against
the
easily
aroused
emotions
and
the
indolent
cowardice
of
her
flesh
against
all
the
solicitations
of
nature
by
which
she
was
assailed
she
had
to
contend
with
the
heat
of
the
day
with
the
suggestions
of
the
darkness
with
the
moist
warmth
of
stormy
weather
with
the
breath
of
her
past
and
her
memories
with
the
pictures
suddenly
thrown
upon
the
background
of
her
mind
with
the
voices
that
whispered
caressingly
in
her
ear
with
the
emotions
that
sent
a
thrill
of
tenderness
into
her
every
limb
weeks
months
years
the
frightful
temptation
endured
and
she
did
not
yield
or
take
another
lover
fearful
of
herself
she
avoided
man
and
fled
from
his
sight
she
continued
her
domestic
unsocial
habits
always
closeted
with
mademoiselle
or
else
above
in
her
own
room
on
sundays
she
did
not
leave
the
house
she
had
ceased
to
consort
with
the
other
maids
in
the
house
and
in
order
to
occupy
her
time
and
forget
herself
she
plunged
into
vast
undertakings
in
the
way
of
sewing
or
buried
herself
in
sleep
when
musicians
came
into
the
courtyard
she
closed
the
windows
in
order
not
to
hear
them
the
sensuousness
of
music
moved
her
very
soul
in
spite
of
everything
she
could
not
calm
or
cool
her
passions
her
evil
thoughts
rekindled
themselves
lived
and
flourished
upon
themselves
at
every
moment
the
fixed
idea
of
desire
arose
from
her
whole
being
became
throughout
her
body
the
fierce
torment
that
knows
no
end
that
delirium
of
the
senses
obsession
the
obsession
that
nothing
can
dispel
and
that
constantly
returns
the
shameless
implacable
obsession
swarming
with
images
the
obsession
that
brings
love
close
to
the
woman
every
sense
that
touches
with
it
her
closed
eyes
forces
it
smoking
into
her
brain
and
pours
it
hot
as
fire
into
her
arteries
at
length
the
nervous
exhaustion
caused
by
these
constant
assaults
the
irritation
of
this
painful
continence
began
to
disturb
faculties
she
fancied
that
she
could
see
her
temptations
a
ghastly
hallucination
brought
the
realization
of
her
dreams
near
to
her
senses
it
happened
that
at
certain
moments
the
things
she
saw
in
her
room
the
candlesticks
the
legs
of
the
chairs
everything
about
her
assumed
impure
appearances
and
shapes
obscenity
arose
from
everything
before
her
eyes
and
approached
her
at
such
times
she
would
look
at
her
kitchen
clock
and
would
say
like
a
condemned
man
whose
body
no
longer
belongs
to
himself
in
five
minutes
i
am
going
down
into
the
street
and
when
the
five
minutes
had
passed
she
would
stay
where
she
was
xlvii
the
time
came
at
last
in
this
life
of
torture
when
germinie
abandoned
the
conflict
her
conscience
yielded
her
will
succumbed
she
bowed
her
head
beneath
her
destiny
all
that
remained
to
her
of
resolution
energy
courage
vanished
before
the
feeling
the
despairing
conviction
of
her
powerlessness
to
save
herself
from
herself
she
felt
that
she
was
being
borne
along
on
a
resistless
current
that
it
was
useless
almost
impious
to
try
to
stop
that
great
power
of
the
world
that
causes
suffering
the
malevolent
power
that
bears
the
name
of
a
god
on
the
marble
of
the
antique
tragedies
and
is
called
on
the
tattooed
brow
of
the
fatality
was
trampling
upon
her
and
germinie
lowered
her
head
beneath
its
foot
when
in
her
hours
of
discouragement
the
bitter
experiences
of
her
past
recurred
to
her
memory
when
she
followed
from
her
infancy
the
links
in
the
chain
of
her
deplorable
existence
that
long
line
of
afflictions
that
had
followed
her
years
and
grown
heavier
with
them
all
the
incidents
that
had
succeeded
one
another
in
her
life
as
if
by
preconcerted
arrangement
on
the
part
of
misery
without
her
having
ever
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
hand
of
the
providence
of
which
she
had
heard
so
much
she
said
to
herself
that
she
was
one
of
those
miserable
creatures
who
are
destined
from
their
birth
to
an
eternity
of
misery
one
of
those
for
whom
happiness
was
not
made
and
who
know
it
only
because
they
envy
it
in
others
she
fed
and
nourished
herself
on
that
thought
and
by
dint
of
yielding
to
the
despair
it
tended
to
produce
by
dint
of
brooding
over
the
unbroken
chain
of
her
misfortunes
and
the
endless
succession
of
her
disappointments
she
reached
the
point
where
she
looked
upon
the
most
trifling
annoyances
of
her
life
and
her
service
as
a
part
of
the
persecution
of
her
evil
genius
a
little
money
that
she
loaned
and
that
was
not
repaid
a
counterfeit
coin
that
was
put
off
upon
her
in
a
shop
an
errand
that
she
failed
to
perform
satisfactorily
a
purchase
in
which
she
was
cheated
all
these
things
were
in
her
opinion
due
neither
to
her
own
fault
nor
to
chance
it
was
the
sequel
of
what
had
gone
before
life
was
in
a
conspiracy
against
her
and
persecuted
her
everywhere
in
everything
great
and
small
from
her
daughter
death
to
bad
groceries
there
were
days
when
she
broke
everything
she
touched
she
thereupon
imagined
that
she
was
accursed
to
her
accursed
almost
damned
she
persuaded
herself
that
she
was
so
in
very
truth
when
she
questioned
her
body
when
she
probed
her
feelings
did
she
not
feel
in
the
fire
in
her
blood
in
the
appetite
of
her
organs
in
her
passionate
weakness
the
spur
of
the
fatality
of
love
the
mystery
and
obsession
of
a
disease
stronger
than
her
modesty
and
her
reason
having
already
delivered
her
over
to
the
shameful
excesses
of
passion
and
destined
she
had
a
presentiment
that
it
was
so
to
deliver
her
again
in
the
same
way
and
so
she
had
one
sentence
always
in
her
mouth
a
sentence
that
was
the
refrain
of
her
thought
what
can
you
expect
i
am
unlucky
i
have
had
no
chance
from
the
beginning
nothing
ever
succeeded
with
me
she
said
it
in
the
tone
of
a
woman
who
has
abandoned
hope
with
the
persuasion
every
day
more
firm
that
she
was
born
under
an
unlucky
star
that
she
was
in
the
power
of
hatred
and
vengeance
that
were
more
powerful
than
she
germinie
had
come
to
be
afraid
of
everything
that
happens
in
ordinary
life
she
lived
in
that
state
of
cowardly
unrest
wherein
the
unexpected
is
dreaded
as
a
possible
calamity
wherein
a
ring
at
the
bell
causes
alarm
wherein
one
turns
a
letter
over
and
over
weighing
the
mystery
it
contains
not
daring
to
open
it
wherein
the
news
you
are
about
to
hear
the
mouth
that
opens
to
speak
to
you
cause
the
perspiration
to
start
upon
your
temples
she
was
in
that
state
of
suspicion
of
shuddering
fear
of
trembling
awe
in
face
of
destiny
wherein
misfortune
sees
naught
but
misfortune
and
wherein
one
would
like
to
check
the
current
of
his
life
so
that
it
should
not
go
forward
whither
all
the
endeavors
and
the
attacks
of
others
are
forcing
it
at
last
by
virtue
of
the
tears
she
shed
she
arrived
at
that
supreme
disdain
that
climax
of
suffering
where
the
excess
of
pain
seems
a
satire
where
chagrin
exceeding
the
utmost
limits
of
human
strength
exceeds
its
sensibility
as
well
and
the
stricken
heart
which
no
longer
feels
the
blows
says
to
the
heaven
it
defies
go

xlviii

in
that
rig
said
germinie
one
sunday
morning
to
adèle

she
passed
in
grand
array
along
the
corridor
on
the
sixth
floor
in
front
of
her
open
door

i
go
too
said
germinie
you
nonsense
you
do
go
to
parties
any
more
but
i
tell
you
i
go
said
germinie
in
a
sharp
decided
tone
just
give
me
time
to
tell
mademoiselle
and
put
on
a
dress
if
you
wait
i
go
and
get
half
a
lobster
half
an
hour
later
the
two
women
left
the
house
they
skirted
the
city
wall
and
found
the
rest
of
the
party
sitting
outside
a
café
on
boulevard
de
la
chopinette
after
taking
a
glass
of
currant
wine
they
entered
two
large
cabs
and
rode
away
when
they
arrived
at
the
fortress
at
vincennes
they
alighted
and
the
whole
party
walked
along
the
bank
of
the
moat
as
they
were
passing
under
the
wall
of
the
fort
the
friend
the
painter
shouted
to
an
artilleryman
who
was
doing
sentry
duty
beside
a
cannon
say
old
fellow
you
rather
drink
one
than
stand
guard
over
it
eh
is
he
funny
said
adèle
to
germinie
nudging
her
with
her
elbow
soon
they
were
fairly
in
the
forest
of
vincennes
narrow
paths
crossed
and
recrossed
in
every
direction
on
the
hard
uneven
ground
in
the
spaces
between
all
these
little
roads
there
was
here
and
there
a
little
grass
but
withered
yellow
dead
grass
strewn
about
like
bedding
for
cattle
its
blades
were
everywhere
mingled
with
briars
amid
the
dull
green
of
nettles
it
was
easily
recognizable
as
one
of
the
rural
spots
to
which
the
great
faubourgs
resort
on
sundays
to
loll
about
in
the
grass
and
which
resemble
a
lawn
trampled
by
a
crowd
after
a
display
of
fireworks
gnarled
misshapen
trees
were
scattered
here
and
there
dwarf
elms
with
gray
trunks
covered
with
yellow
spots
and
stripped
of
branches
to
a
point
higher
than
a
man
head
scraggy
oaks
eaten
by
caterpillars
so
that
their
leaves
were
like
lacework
the
verdure
was
scant
and
sickly
and
entirely
unshaded
the
leaves
above
had
a
very
unhealthy
look
the
stunted
ragged
parched
foliage
made
only
faint
green
lines
against
the
sky
clouds
of
dust
from
the
covered
the
bushes
with
a
gray
pall
everything
had
the
wretched
impoverished
aspect
of
trampled
vegetation
that
has
no
chance
to
breathe
the
melancholy
effect
of
the
grass
at
the
barriers
nature
seemed
to
sprout
from
beneath
the
pavements
no
birds
sang
in
the
trees
no
insects
hummed
about
the
dusty
ground
the
noise
of
the
stunned
the
birds
the
put
the
rustling
of
the
trees
to
silence
the
denizens
of
the
street
strolled
about
through
the
paths
singing
women
hats
fastened
with
four
pins
to
a
handkerchief
were
hanging
from
the
trees
the
red
plume
of
an
artilleryman
burst
upon
one
at
every
moment
through
the
scanty
leaves
dealers
in
honey
rose
from
the
thickets
on
the
trampled
greensward
children
in
blouses
were
cutting
twigs
workingmen
families
idling
their
time
away
nibbling
at
and
little
urchins
catching
butterflies
in
their
caps
it
was
a
forest
after
the
pattern
of
the
original
bois
de
boulogne
hot
and
dusty
a
and
promenade
one
of
those
spots
avaricious
of
shade
to
which
the
common
people
flock
to
disport
themselves
at
the
gates
of
great
capitals
burlesque
forests
filled
with
corks
where
you
find
slices
of
melon
and
skeletons
in
the
underbrush
the
heat
on
this
day
was
stifling
the
sun
was
swimming
in
clouds
shedding
a
veiled
diffuse
light
that
was
almost
blinding
to
the
eyes
and
that
seemed
to
portend
a
storm
the
air
was
heavy
and
dead
nothing
stirred
the
leaves
and
their
tiny
meagre
shadows
did
not
move
the
forest
seemed
weary
and
crushed
as
it
were
beneath
the
heavy
sky
at
rare
intervals
a
breath
of
air
from
the
south
passed
lazily
along
sweeping
the
ground
one
of
those
enervating
lifeless
winds
that
blow
upon
the
senses
and
fan
the
breath
of
desire
into
a
flame
with
no
knowledge
whence
it
came
germinie
felt
over
her
whole
body
a
sensation
like
the
tickling
of
the
down
on
a
ripe
peach
against
the
skin
they
went
gayly
along
with
the
somewhat
excited
activity
that
the
country
air
imparts
to
the
common
people
the
men
ran
the
women
tripped
after
them
and
caught
them
they
played
at
rolling
on
the
grass
there
was
a
manifest
longing
to
dance
and
climb
trees
the
painter
amused
himself
by
throwing
stones
at
the
in
the
gateways
of
the
fortress
and
he
never
missed
his
aim
at
last
they
all
sat
down
in
a
sort
of
clearing
under
a
clump
of
oaks
whose
shadows
were
lengthening
in
the
setting
sun
the
men
lighting
matches
on
the
seats
of
their
trousers
began
to
smoke
the
women
chattered
and
laughed
and
threw
themselves
backward
in
paroxysms
of
inane
hilarity
and
noisy
outbursts
of
delight
germinie
alone
did
not
speak
or
laugh
she
did
not
listen
or
look
her
eyes
beneath
their
lowered
lids
were
fixed
upon
the
toes
of
her
boots
so
engrossed
in
thought
was
she
that
you
would
have
said
she
was
totally
oblivious
to
time
and
place
lying
at
full
length
on
the
grass
her
head
slightly
raised
by
a
hammock
she
made
no
other
movement
than
to
lay
her
hands
palm
downwards
on
the
grass
beside
her
in
a
short
time
she
would
turn
them
on
their
backs
and
let
them
lie
in
that
position
seeking
the
coolness
of
the
earth
to
allay
the
fever
of
her
flesh
there
a
lazybones
going
to
sleep
said
adèle
germinie
opened
wide
her
blazing
eyes
without
answering
and
until
dinner
maintained
the
same
position
the
same
silence
the
same
air
of
torpor
feeling
about
her
for
places
where
her
burning
hands
had
not
rested
come
old
girl
said
a
woman
voice
sing
us
something
oh
no
adèle
replied
i
have
got
wind
enough
before
eating
suddenly
a
great
stone
came
hurtling
through
the
air
and
struck
the
ground
near
germinie
head
at
the
same
moment
she
heard
the
voice
shouting
do
be
afraid
that
your
chair
one
and
all
laid
their
handkerchiefs
on
the
ground
by
way
of
tablecloth
eatables
were
produced
from
greasy
papers
bottles
were
uncorked
and
the
wine
went
round
the
glasses
were
rested
against
tufts
of
grass
and
they
fell
to
upon
bits
of
pork
and
sausages
with
slices
of
bread
for
plates
the
painter
cut
boats
out
of
paper
to
hold
the
salt
and
imitated
the
orders
shouted
out
by
waiters
in
a
café
pavillon
servez
he
cried
the
company
gradually
became
animated
the
open
air
the
patches
of
blue
sky
the
food
and
drink
started
the
gayety
of
the
table
in
full
blast
hands
approached
one
another
mouths
met
coarse
remarks
were
whispered
from
one
to
another
shirt
sleeves
crept
around
waists
and
now
and
then
energetic
embraces
were
attended
by
greedy
resounding
kisses
germinie
drank
and
said
nothing
the
painter
who
had
taken
his
place
by
her
side
felt
decidedly
chilly
and
embarrassed
beside
his
extraordinary
neighbor
who
amused
herself
so
entirely
inside
suddenly
he
began
to
beat
a
tattoo
with
his
knife
against
his
glass
drowning
the
uproar
of
the
party
and
rose
to
his
knees
mesdames
said
he
with
the
voice
of
a
paroquet
that
has
sung
too
much
here
the
health
of
a
man
in
hard
luck
myself
perhaps
it
will
bring
me
good
luck
deserted
yes
mesdames
yes

been
deserted
i
a
widower
you
know
the
kind
of
widower
i
was
struck
all
of
a
heap
not
that
i
cared
much
for
her
but
habit
that
old
villain
habit
the
fact
is
i
as
bored
as
a
in
a
watch
spring
for
two
weeks
my
life
has
been
like
a
restaurant
without
a
and
when
i
love
love
as
if
it
had
made
me
no
wife
that
what
i
call
weaning
a
grown
man
that
is
to
say
since
i
known
what
it
is
i
take
off
my
hat
to
the
curés
i
feel
very
sorry
for
them
my
word

there
are
so
many
of
but
i
ca
walk
about
with
a
sign
man
to
let
inquire
in
the
first
place
it
would
have
to
be
stamped
by
le
préfet
and
then
people
are
such
fools
it
would
draw
a
crowd
all
of
which
mesdames
is
intended
to
inform
you
that
if
among
the
people
you
have
the
honor
of
knowing
there

happen

be
one
who
like
to
make
an
acquaintance

pretty
little
marriage

farther

just
drowned
his
wife
gautruche
called

a
pretty
fellow
who
knows
what
what
who
does
beat
about
the
bush
a
good
old
body
who
takes
things
easy
and
who
wo
give
himself
the
colic
with
that
grog
with
that
he
took
a
bottle
of
water
that
stood
beside
him
and
hurled
it
twenty
yards
away
long
live
the
walls

the
same
to

that
the
sky
is
to
the
good
god
paints
them
through
the
week
and
beats
them
on
monday
and
with
all
that
not
jealous
not
ugly
not
a
but
a
real
love
of
a
man
who
never
harmed
one
of
the
fair
sex
in
his
life
if
you
want
physique
i
your
man
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
drawing
up
his
wavering
body
clad
in
an
old
blue
coat
with
gilt
buttons
to
its
full
height
removing
his
gray
hat
so
as
to
show
his
perspiring
polished
bald
skull
and
tossing
his
old
plucked
head
he
continued
you
see
what
it
is
it
is
a
very
attractive
piece
of
property
it
does
help
it
to
exhibit
it
but
it
yields
well
it
a
little
dilapidated
but
well
put
together
dame
here
i
am
with
my
little
forty
no
more
hair
than
a
billiard
ball
a
witchgrass
beard
that
would
make
good
foundations
not
too
solid
feet
as
long
as
la
villette
and
with
all
the
rest
thin
enough
to
take
a
bath
in
a
there
the
bill
of
lading
pass
the
prospectus
along
if
any
woman
wants
all
that
in
a
lump
any
respectable
person
not
too
young
who
wo
amuse
herself
by
painting
me
too
yellow
you
understand
i
do
ask
for
a
princess
of
batignolles
why
sure
as
you
born
i
her
man
germinie
seized
gautruche
glass
half
emptied
it
at
a
draught
and
held
out
the
side
from
which
she
had
drunk
to
him
at
nightfall
the
party
returned
on
foot
when
they
reached
the
fortifications
gautruche
drew
a
large
heart
with
the
point
of
his
knife
on
the
stone
and
all
the
names
with
the
date
were
carved
inside
in
the
evening
gautruche
and
germinie
were
upon
the
outer
boulevards
near
barrière
rochechouart
beside
a
low
house
with
these
words
in
a
plaster
panel
cut
and
tried
on
two
they
stopped
at
a
stone
staircase
of
three
steps
leading
into
a
dark
passage
at
the
end
of
which
shone
the
red
light
of
an
argand
lamp
at
the
entrance
to
the
passage
these
words
were
printed
in
black
on
a
wooden
sign
of
the
little
blue
xlix
médérie
gautruche
was
one
of
the
wenching
idling
vagabond
workmen
who
make
their
whole
life
a
monday
filled
with
the
love
of
wine
his
lips
forever
wet
with
the
last
drop
his
insides
as
thoroughly
lined
with
tartar
as
an
old
wine
cask
he
was
one
of
those
whom
the
burgundians
graphically
call
always
a
little
tipsy
tipsy
from
yesterday
when
he
had
drunk
nothing
he
looked
at
life
through
the
sunbeam
in
his
head
he
smiled
at
his
fate
he
yielded
to
it
with
the
easy
indifference
of
the
drunkard
smiling
vaguely
from
the
steps
of
the
wineshop
at
things
in
general
at
life
and
the
road
that
stretched
away
into
the
darkness
care
want
had
gained
no
hold
upon
him
and
if
by
chance
a
grave
or
gloomy
thought
did
come
into
his
mind
he
turned
his
head
away
uttered
an
exclamation
that
sounded
like
which
was
his
way
of
saying
and
raising
his
right
arm
caricaturing
the
gesture
of
a
spanish
dancer
he
would
toss
his
melancholy
over
his
shoulder
to
the
devil
he
had
the
superb
philosophy
the
jovial
serenity
of
the
bottle
he
knew
neither
envy
nor
longing
his
dreams
served
him
as
a
cashbox
for
three
sous
he
was
sure
of
a
small
glass
of
happiness
for
twelve
of
a
bottle
of
ideal
bliss
being
content
with
everything
he
liked
everything
and
found
food
for
laughter
and
entertainment
in
everything
nothing
in
the
world
seemed
sad
to
him
except
a
glass
of
water
with
this
drunkard
expansiveness
with
the
gayety
of
his
excellent
health
and
his
temperament
gautruche
combined
the
characteristic
gayety
of
his
profession
the
good
humor
and
the
of
that
free
unfatiguing
life
in
the
open
air
between
heaven
and
earth
which
seeks
distraction
in
singing
and
flings
the
workmen
at
from
its
lofty
perch
upon
a
ladder
he
was
a
and
did
lettering
he
was
the
one
man
in
paris
who
would
attack
a
sign
without
a
measure
with
no
other
guide
than
a
cord
without
outlining
the
letters
in
white
he
was
the
only
one
who
could
place
each
of
the
letters
in
position
inside
of
the
frame
of
a
placard
and
without
losing
an
instant
in
aligning
them
dash
off
capitals
he
was
also
renowned
for
fantastic
letters
capricious
letters
letters
shaded
in
bronze
or
gold
to
imitate
those
cut
in
stone
thus
he
made
fifteen
to
twenty
francs
on
some
days
but
as
he
drank
it
all
up
he
was
not
wealthy
and
he
always
had
unpaid
scores
on
the
slate
at
the
he
was
a
man
brought
up
in
the
street
the
street
had
been
his
mother
his
nurse
and
his
school
the
street
had
given
him
his
his
ready
tongue
and
his
wit
all
that
the
keen
mind
of
a
man
of
the
people
can
pick
up
upon
the
pavements
of
paris
he
had
picked
up
all
that
falls
from
the
upper
to
the
lower
strata
of
a
great
city
the
strainings
and
drippings
the
crumbs
of
ideas
and
information
the
things
that
float
in
the
sensitive
atmosphere
and
the
brimming
gutters
the
contact
with
the
covers
of
books
bits
of
swallowed
between
two
glasses
odds
and
ends
of
plays
heard
on
the
boulevard
had
endowed
him
with
that
accidental
intelligence
which
though
without
education
learns
everything
he
possessed
an
inexhaustible
imperturbable
store
of
talk
his
words
gushed
forth
abundantly
in
original
remarks
laughable
images
the
metaphors
that
flow
from
the
comic
genius
of
crowds
he
had
the
natural
picturesqueness
of
the
unadulterated
farce
he
was
brimming
over
with
amusing
stories
and
buffoonery
rich
in
the
possession
of
the
richest
of
all
repertories
of
nonsense
being
a
member
of
divers
of
the
low
haunts
called
he
knew
all
the
new
tunes
and
ballads
and
he
was
never
tired
of
singing
he
was
amusing
in
short
from
head
to
foot
and
if
you
merely
looked
at
him
you
laughed
at
him
as
at
a
comic
actor
a
man
of
his
cheerful
hearty
temperament
suited
germinie
germinie
was
not
a
mere
beast
of
burden
with
nothing
but
her
work
in
her
head
she
was
not
the
servant
who
stands
like
a
post
with
the
frightened
face
and
doltish
air
of
utter
stupidity
when
masters
and
mistresses
are
talking
in
her
presence
she
too
had
cast
off
her
shell
fashioned
herself
and
opened
her
mind
to
the
education
of
paris
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
having
no
occupation
and
being
interested
after
the
manner
of
old
maids
in
what
was
going
on
in
the
quarter
had
long
been
in
the
habit
of
making
germinie
tell
her
what
news
she
had
gleaned
what
she
knew
of
the
tenants
all
the
gossip
of
the
house
and
the
street
and
this
habit
of
narration
of
talking
with
her
mistress
like
a
sort
of
companion
of
describing
people
and
drawing
silhouettes
of
them
had
eventually
developed
in
her
a
facility
of
animated
description
of
happy
unconscious
characterization
a
piquancy
and
sometimes
an
acrimony
in
her
remarks
that
were
most
remarkable
in
the
mouth
of
a
servant
she
had
progressed
so
far
that
she
often
surprised
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
by
her
quickness
of
comprehension
her
promptness
at
grasping
things
only
half
said
her
good
fortune
and
facility
in
selecting
such
words
as
good
talkers
use
she
knew
how
to
jest
she
understood
a
play
upon
words
she
expressed
herself
without
and
when
there
was
a
discussion
concerning
orthography
at
the
creamery
her
opinion
was
listened
to
with
as
much
deference
as
that
of
the
clerk
in
the
registry
of
deaths
at
the
mayoralty
who
came
there
to
breakfast
she
had
also
that
background
of
indiscriminate
reading
which
women
of
her
class
have
when
they
read
at
all
with
the
two
or
three
kept
women
in
whose
service
she
had
been
she
had
passed
her
nights
devouring
novels
since
then
she
had
continued
to
read
the
cut
by
her
acquaintances
from
the
bottom
of
newspapers
and
she
had
gathered
from
them
a
vague
idea
of
many
things
and
of
some
of
the
kings
of
france
she
had
retained
enough
of
such
subjects
to
make
her
desire
to
talk
of
them
with
others
through
a
woman
in
the
house
who
worked
for
an
author
on
the
street
she
often
had
tickets
to
the
play
when
she
came
away
she
could
remember
the
whole
play
and
the
names
of
the
actors
she
had
seen
on
the
programme
she
loved
to
buy
ballads
and
one
sou
novels
and
read
them
the
air
the
keen
breath
of
quartier
bréda
full
of
the
of
the
artist
and
the
studio
of
art
and
vice
had
sharpened
these
tastes
of
germinie
mind
and
had
created
in
her
new
needs
and
demands
long
before
her
disorderly
life
began
she
had
cut
loose
from
the
virtuous
companionship
of
decent
women
of
her
rank
and
station
from
the
worthy
creatures
who
were
so
uninteresting
and
stupid
she
had
quitted
the
circle
of
orderly
dull
uprightness
of
conversations
around
the
under
the
auspices
of
the
old
servants
of
mademoiselle
elderly
acquaintances
she
had
shunned
the
wearisome
society
of
maids
whom
their
absorption
in
their
employment
and
the
fascination
of
the
savings
bank
rendered
unendurably
stupid
she
had
reached
the
point
where
before
accepting
the
companionship
of
people
she
must
satisfy
herself
that
they
possessed
a
degree
of
intelligence
corresponding
to
her
own
and
were
capable
of
understanding
her
and
now
when
she
emerged
from
her
fits
of
brutishness
when
she
found
her
old
self
and
was
born
again
in
diversion
and
pleasure
she
must
for
her
enjoyment
have
kindred
spirits
of
her
own
she
wanted
men
about
her
who
would
make
her
laugh
noisy
gayety
the
spirituous
wit
that
intoxicated
her
with
the
wine
that
was
poured
into
her
glass
and
thus
it
was
that
she
sank
to
the
level
of
the
rascally
bohemia
of
the
common
people
uproarious
maddening
intoxicating
like
all
bohemias
thus
it
was
that
she
fell
to
the
lot
of
a
gautruche
l
as
germinie
was
returning
to
the
house
one
morning
at
daybreak
she
heard
from
the
shadows
of
the
as
it
closed
behind
her
a
voice
cry
who
that
she
ran
to
the
servants
staircase
but
found
that
she
was
pursued
and
as
she
turned
a
corner
on
the
landing
the
concierge
seized
her
as
soon
as
he
recognized
her
he
said
oh
is
it
you
excuse
me
do
be
frightened
what
a
giddy
creature
you
are
it
surprises
you
to
see
me
up
so
early
eh
it
on
account
of
the
thieving
that
going
on
these
days
in
the
cook
bedroom
on
the
second
to
you
it
lucky
for
you
i
do
tell
all
i
know
a
few
days
later
germinie
learned
through
adèle
that
the
husband
of
the
cook
who
had
been
robbed
said
that
there
was
no
need
to
look
very
far
that
the
thief
was
in
the
house
and
that
he
knew
what
he
knew
adèle
added
that
it
was
making
a
good
deal
of
talk
in
the
street
and
that
there
were
plenty
of
people
who
would
believe
it
and
repeat
it
germinie
became
very
indignant
and
told
her
mistress
all
about
it
mademoiselle
was
even
more
indignant
than
she
and
feeling
personally
outraged
by
the
insult
wrote
instantly
to
the
cook
mistress
that
she
must
put
a
stop
at
once
to
the
slanderous
statements
concerning
a
girl
who
had
been
in
her
service
twenty
years
and
for
whom
she
would
answer
as
for
herself
the
cook
was
reprimanded
her
husband
in
his
wrath
talked
louder
than
ever
he
made
a
great
outcry
and
for
several
days
filled
the
house
with
his
project
of
going
to
the
commissioner
of
police
and
calling
upon
him
to
question
germinie
as
to
where
she
procured
the
money
to
start
the
son
in
business
as
to
where
she
procured
the
money
to
purchase
a
substitute
for
him
and
how
she
paid
the
expenses
of
the
men
she
kept
for
a
whole
week
the
terrible
threat
hung
over
germinie
head
at
last
the
thief
was
discovered
and
the
threat
fell
to
the
ground
but
it
had
had
its
effect
on
the
poor
girl
it
had
done
all
the
injury
it
could
do
in
that
confused
brain
where
under
the
sudden
overpowering
rush
of
the
blood
her
reason
was
wavering
and
became
overcast
at
the
slightest
shock
it
had
overturned
that
brain
which
was
so
prompt
to
go
astray
in
fear
or
vexation
which
lost
so
quickly
the
faculty
of
good
judgment
of
discernment
and
appreciation
of
its
surroundings
which
exaggerated
its
troubles
which
plunged
into
foolish
alarms
previsions
of
evil
despairing
presentiments
which
looked
upon
its
terrors
as
realities
and
was
constantly
lost
in
the
pessimism
of
that
species
of
delirium
at
the
end
of
which
it
could
find
nothing
but
this
ejaculation
and
this
phrase
bah
i
will
kill
myself
throughout
the
week
the
fever
in
her
brain
caused
her
to
experience
all
the
effects
of
the
things
she
thought
might
happen
by
day
and
night
she
saw
her
shame
laid
bare
and
made
public
she
saw
her
secret
her
cowardice
her
all
that
she
carried
about
with
her
concealed
and
sewn
in
her
heart
she
saw
it
all
uncovered
noised
abroad
disclosed
disclosed
to
mademoiselle
her
debts
on
account
augmented
by
her
debts
for
drink
and
for
food
for
gautruche
by
all
that
she
purchased
now
on
credit
her
debt
to
the
concierge
and
the
shopkeepers
would
soon
become
known
and
ruin
her
a
cold
shiver
ran
down
her
back
at
the
thought
she
could
feel
mademoiselle
turning
her
away
throughout
the
week
she
constantly
imagined
herself
standing
before
the
commissioner
of
police
seven
long
days
she
brooded
over
that
word
and
that
idea
the
law
the
law
as
it
appears
to
the
imagination
of
the
lower
classes
something
terrible
indefinable
inevitable
which
is
everywhere
and
lurks
in
everyone
shadow
an
omnipotent
source
of
calamity
which
appears
vaguely
in
the
judge
black
gown
between
the
police
sergeant
and
the
executioner
with
the
hands
of
the
gendarme
and
the
arms
of
the
guillotine
she
who
was
subject
to
all
the
instinctive
terrors
of
the
common
people
and
who
often
repeated
that
she
would
much
rather
die
than
appear
before
the
court
she
imagined
herself
seated
in
the
dock
between
two
gendarmes
in
a
surrounded
by
all
the
unfamiliar
paraphernalia
of
the
law
her
ignorance
of
which
made
them
objects
of
terror
to
her
throughout
the
week
her
ears
heard
footsteps
on
the
stairs
coming
to
arrest
her
the
shock
was
too
violent
for
nerves
as
weak
as
hers
the
mental
upheaval
of
that
week
of
agony
possessed
her
with
an
idea
that
hitherto
had
only
hovered
about
her
the
idea
of
suicide
she
began
to
listen
with
her
head
in
her
hands
to
the
voice
that
spoke
to
her
of
deliverance
she
opened
her
ears
to
the
sweet
music
of
death
that
we
hear
in
the
background
of
life
like
the
fall
of
mighty
waters
in
the
distance
dying
away
in
space
the
temptations
that
speak
to
the
discouraged
heart
of
the
things
that
put
an
end
to
life
so
quickly
and
so
easily
of
the
means
of
quelling
suffering
with
the
hand
pursued
and
solicited
her
her
glance
rested
wistfully
upon
all
the
things
about
her
that
could
cure
the
disease
called
life
she
accustomed
her
fingers
and
her
lips
to
them
she
touched
them
handled
them
drew
them
near
to
her
she
sought
to
test
her
courage
upon
them
and
to
obtain
a
foretaste
of
death
she
would
remain
for
hours
at
her
kitchen
window
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
pavements
in
the
courtyard
down
at
the
foot
of
the
five
flights
pavements
that
she
knew
and
could
have
distinguished
from
others
as
the
daylight
faded
she
would
lean
farther
out
bending
almost
double
over
the
hoping
always
that
it
would
give
way
and
drag
her
down
with
it
praying
that
she
might
die
without
having
to
make
the
desperate
voluntary
leap
into
space
to
which
she
no
longer
felt
equal
why
you
fall
out
said
mademoiselle
one
day
grasping
her
skirt
impulsively
in
her
alarm
what
are
you
looking
at
down
there
in
the
courtyard
oh
nothing
the
pavements
in
heaven
name
are
you
crazy
how
you
frightened
me
oh
people
do
fall
that
way
said
germinie
in
a
strange
tone
i
tell
you
mademoiselle
in
order
to
fall
one
must
have
a
mighty
longing
to
do
it
li
germinie
had
not
been
able
to
induce
gautruche
who
was
haunted
by
a
former
mistress
to
give
her
the
key
to
his
room
when
he
had
not
returned
she
was
obliged
to
await
his
coming
outside
in
the
cold
dark
street
at
first
she
would
walk
back
and
forth
in
front
of
the
house
she
would
take
twenty
steps
in
one
direction
and
twenty
in
the
other
then
as
if
to
prolong
her
period
of
waiting
she
would
take
a
longer
turn
and
going
farther
and
farther
every
time
would
end
by
extending
her
walk
to
both
ends
of
the
boulevard
frequently
she
walked
thus
for
hours
shamefaced
and
in
the
fog
and
darkness
amid
the
iniquitous
and
horrible
surroundings
of
an
avenue
near
the
barriers
where
darkness
reigned
she
followed
the
line
of
shops
the
naked
arbors
the
trellises
supported
by
dead
trees
such
as
we
see
in
low
flat
hovels
with
curtainless
windows
cut
at
random
in
the
walls
cap
factories
where
shirts
are
sold
and
hotels
where
a
night
lodging
may
be
had
she
passed
by
closed
shops
black
with
bankruptcy
by
fragments
of
condemned
walls
by
dark
passageways
with
iron
gratings
by
windows
by
doors
that
seemed
to
give
admission
to
those
abodes
of
murder
the
plan
of
which
is
handed
to
the
jury
at
the
assizes
as
she
went
on
there
were
gloomy
little
gardens
crooked
buildings
architecture
in
its
most
degraded
form
tall
mouldy
within
which
could
be
vaguely
seen
the
uncanny
whiteness
of
stones
in
the
darkness
corners
of
unfinished
buildings
from
which
arose
the
stench
of
nitrification
walls
disfigured
by
disgusting
placards
and
fragments
of
torn
advertisements
by
which
they
were
spotted
with
loathsome
publications
as
by
leprosy
from
time
to
time
at
a
sharp
turn
in
the
street
she
would
come
upon
lanes
that
seemed
to
plunge
into
dark
holes
a
few
steps
from
their
beginning
and
from
which
a
blast
of
damp
air
came
forth
as
from
a
cellar
dark
stood
out
against
the
sky
with
the
rigidity
of
a
great
wall
streets
stretched
vaguely
away
in
the
distance
with
the
feeble
gleam
of
a
lantern
twinkling
here
and
there
at
long
intervals
upon
the
ghostly
plaster
fronts
of
the
houses
germinie
would
walk
on
and
on
she
would
cover
all
the
territory
where
low
debauchery
fills
its
crop
on
mondays
and
finds
its
loves
between
a
hospital
a
and
a
cemetery
lariboisière
the
abattoir
and
montmartre
the
people
who
passed
that
way
the
workman
returning
from
paris
whistling
the
workingwoman
her
day
work
ended
hurrying
on
with
her
hands
under
her
armpits
to
keep
herself
warm
the
in
her
black
cap
would
stare
at
her
as
they
passed
strange
men
acted
as
if
they
recognized
her
the
light
made
her
ashamed
she
would
turn
and
run
toward
the
other
end
of
the
boulevard
and
follow
the
dark
deserted
footway
along
the
city
wall
but
she
was
soon
driven
away
by
horrible
shadows
of
men
and
by
brutally
familiar
hands
she
tried
to
go
away
she
insulted
herself
inwardly
she
called
herself
a
cowardly
wretch
she
swore
to
herself
that
each
turn
should
be
the
last
that
she
would
go
as
far
as
a
certain
tree
and
that
was
all
if
he
had
not
returned
she
would
go
away
and
put
an
end
to
the
whole
thing
but
she
did
not
go
she
walked
on
and
on
she
waited
more
consumed
than
ever
the
longer
he
delayed
with
the
mad
desire
to
see
him
at
last
as
the
hours
flew
by
and
the
boulevard
became
empty
germinie
exhausted
overdone
with
weariness
would
approach
the
houses
she
would
loiter
from
shop
to
shop
she
would
go
mechanically
where
gas
was
still
burning
and
stand
stupidly
in
the
bright
glare
from
the
shop
windows
she
welcomed
the
dazzling
light
in
her
eyes
she
tried
to
allay
her
impatience
by
benumbing
it
the
objects
to
be
seen
through
the
perspiring
windows
of
the
the
cooking
utensils
the
bowls
of
punch
flanked
by
two
empty
bottles
with
sprigs
of
laurel
protruding
from
their
necks
the
in
which
the
liquors
combined
their
varied
colors
in
a
single
beam
a
cup
filled
with
plated
spoons
these
things
would
hold
her
attention
for
a
long
while
she
would
read
the
old
announcements
of
lottery
drawings
placarded
on
the
walls
of
a
saloon
the
advertisements
of
coffee
with
brandy
the
inscriptions
in
yellow
letters
wine
pure
blood
for
a
whole
quarter
of
an
hour
she
would
stand
staring
into
a
back
room
containing
a
man
in
a
blouse
sitting
on
a
stool
by
a
table
a
a
slate
and
two
black
against
the
wall
her
fixed
vacant
stare
would
rest
through
the
reddish
mist
upon
the
dark
forms
of
shoemakers
leaning
over
their
benches
it
fell
and
lingered
heedlessly
upon
a
counter
that
was
being
washed
upon
hands
that
were
counting
the
receipts
of
the
day
upon
a
tunnel
or
jug
that
was
being
scoured
with
sandstone
she
had
ceased
to
think
she
would
simply
stand
there
nailed
to
the
spot
and
growing
weaker
and
weaker
feeling
her
courage
vanish
from
the
mere
weariness
of
standing
on
her
feet
seeing
things
only
through
a
sort
of
film
as
in
a
swoon
hearing
the
noise
made
by
the
muddy
cabs
rolling
over
the
wet
pavements
only
as
a
buzzing
in
her
ears
ready
to
fall
and
compelled
again
and
again
to
lean
against
the
wall
for
support
in
her
then
condition
of
prostration
and
illness
with
that
of
vertigo
that
made
her
so
timid
of
crossing
the
seine
and
impelled
her
to
cling
to
the
bridge
railings
it
happened
that
on
certain
evenings
when
it
rained
these
fits
of
weakness
that
she
had
upon
the
outer
boulevard
assumed
the
terrors
of
a
nightmare
when
the
light
from
the
lanterns
trembling
in
misty
vapor
cast
its
varying
flickering
reflection
on
the
damp
ground
when
the
pavements
the
sidewalks
the
earth
seemed
to
melt
away
and
disappear
under
the
rain
and
there
was
no
appearance
of
solidity
anywhere
in
the
aqueous
darkness
the
wretched
creature
almost
mad
with
fatigue
would
fancy
that
she
could
see
a
flood
rising
in
the
gutter
a
mirage
of
terror
would
show
her
suddenly
the
water
all
about
her
and
creeping
constantly
nearer
to
her
she
would
close
her
eyes
not
daring
to
move
fearing
to
feel
her
feet
slip
from
under
her
she
would
begin
to
weep
and
would
weep
on
until
someone
passed
by
and
offered
to
escort
her
to
the
of
the
little
blue
lii
she
would
then
ascend
the
stairs
that
was
her
last
place
of
refuge
she
would
fly
from
the
rain
and
snow
and
cold
from
fear
despair
and
fatigue
she
would
go
up
and
sit
on
the
top
step
against
closed
doors
she
would
draw
her
shawl
and
skirts
closely
about
her
in
order
to
leave
room
for
those
who
went
and
came
up
that
long
steep
ladder
and
would
draw
back
as
far
as
possible
into
the
corner
in
order
that
her
shame
might
fill
but
little
space
on
the
narrow
landing
from
the
open
doors
the
odor
of
unventilated
closets
of
families
heaped
together
in
a
single
room
the
exhalations
of
unhealthy
trades
the
dense
greasy
fumes
of
cooking
done
in
on
the
floor
the
stench
of
rags
and
the
faint
damp
smell
of
clothes
drying
in
the
house
came
forth
and
filled
the
hall
the
window
behind
germinie
wafted
to
her
nostrils
the
fetid
stench
of
a
leaden
pipe
in
which
the
whole
house
emptied
its
refuse
and
its
filth
her
stomach
rose
in
revolt
every
moment
at
a
puff
of
infection
she
was
obliged
to
take
from
her
pocket
a
phial
of
melissa
water
that
she
always
carried
and
swallow
a
mouthful
of
it
to
avoid
being
ill
but
the
staircase
had
its
passers
too
honest
workmen
wives
went
up
with
a
bushel
of
charcoal
or
a
pint
of
wine
for
supper
their
feet
would
rub
against
her
as
they
passed
and
as
they
went
farther
up
germinie
would
feel
their
scornful
glances
resting
upon
her
and
falling
upon
her
with
more
crushing
force
at
every
floor
the
children
little
girls
in
who
flitted
up
the
dark
stairway
and
brightened
it
as
if
with
flowers
little
girls
in
whom
she
saw
as
she
so
often
saw
in
dreams
her
own
little
one
living
and
grown
to
girlhood
she
saw
them
stop
and
look
at
her
with
wide
open
eyes
that
seemed
to
recoil
from
her
then
the
little
creatures
would
turn
and
run
breathlessly
and
when
they
were
well
out
of
reach
would
lean
over
the
rail
until
they
almost
fell
and
hurl
impure
jests
at
her
the
insults
of
the
children
of
the
common
people
insulting
words
poured
out
upon
her
by
those
rosebud
mouths
wounded
germinie
more
deeply
than
all
else
she
would
half
rise
for
an
instant
then
overwhelmed
by
shame
resigning
herself
to
her
fate
she
would
fall
back
into
her
corner
and
pulling
her
shawl
over
her
head
in
order
to
bury
herself
therein
out
of
sight
she
would
sit
like
a
dead
woman
crushed
inert
insensible
cowering
over
her
own
shadow
like
a
bundle
tossed
on
the
floor
which
everyone
might
tread
upon
having
no
control
of
her
faculties
dead
to
everything
except
the
footsteps
that
she
was
listening
for
and
that
did
not
come
at
last
after
long
hours
hours
that
she
could
not
count
she
would
fancy
that
she
heard
a
stumbling
walk
in
the
street
then
a
vinous
voice
would
mount
the
stairs
stammering
of
a
you
sold
me
the
kind
of
wine
that
goes
to
my
head
it
was
he
and
almost
every
day
the
same
scene
was
enacted
ah
there
my
germinie
he
would
say
as
his
eyes
fell
upon
her
it
like
this
i
tell
you
all
about
it
i
a
little
bit
under
water
and
as
he
put
the
key
in
the
lock
i
tell
you
all
about
it
it
is
my
fault
he
would
enter
the
room
kick
aside
a
with
mangy
wings
that
limped
forward
to
greet
him
and
close
the
door
it
was
me
d
see
it
was
paillon
you
know
paillon
that
little
round
fellow
fat
as
a
mad
dog
well
it
was
him
my
honor
he
insisted
on
paying
for
a
bottle
for
me
he
offered
to
treat
me
and
i
him
thanks
thereupon
we
naturally
our
coffee
when
consoled
you
console
and
as
one
thing
led
to
another
we
fell
upon
each
other
there
was
a
very
devil
of
a
carnage
the
proof
of
it
is
that
that
of
a
threw
us
like
lobster
shells
germinie
during
the
explanation
would
have
lighted
the
candle
stuck
in
a
yellow
copper
candlestick
by
its
flickering
light
the
dirty
paper
on
the
walls
could
be
seen
covered
with
caricatures
from
torn
from
the
paper
and
pasted
on
the
wall
well
you
a
love
gautruche
would
exclaim
as
he
saw
her
place
a
cold
fowl
and
two
bottles
of
wine
on
the
table
for
i
must
tell
you
all
i
had
in
my
stomach
a
plate
of
wretched
soup
that
all
ah
it
must
have
taken
a
stout
to
put
that
fellow
eyes
out
and
he
would
begin
to
eat
germinie
would
sit
with
her
elbows
on
the
table
watching
him
and
drinking
and
her
glance
would
grow
dark
pshaw
all
the
négresses
are
dead
gautruche
would
say
at
last
as
he
drained
the
bottles
one
by
one
put
the
children
to
bed
thereupon
terrible
fierce
abhorrent
outbursts
of
passion
would
ensue
between
those
two
strange
creatures
savage
ardor
followed
by
savage
satiety
frantic
storms
of
lust
caresses
that
were
impregnated
with
the
fierce
brutality
of
wine
kisses
that
seemed
to
seek
the
blood
beneath
the
skin
like
the
tongue
of
a
wild
beast
and
at
the
end
utter
exhaustion
that
swallowed
them
up
and
left
their
bodies
like
corpses
germinie
plunged
into
these
debauches
with
what
shall
i
say
delirium
madness
desperation
a
sort
of
supreme
frenzy
her
ungovernable
passions
turned
against
themselves
and
going
beyond
their
natural
appetites
forced
themselves
to
suffer
satiety
exhausted
them
without
extinguishing
them
and
overpassing
the
widest
limits
of
excess
they
excited
themselves
to
in
the
poor
creature
paroxysms
of
excitement
her
brain
her
nerves
the
imagination
of
her
maddened
body
no
longer
sought
pleasure
in
pleasure
but
something
sharper
keener
and
more
violent
pain
in
pleasure
and
the
words
to
die
constantly
escaped
from
her
compressed
lips
as
if
she
were
invoking
death
in
an
undertone
and
seeking
to
embrace
it
in
the
agonies
of
love
sometimes
in
the
night
she
would
suddenly
sit
up
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
rest
her
bare
feet
on
the
cold
floor
and
remain
there
listening
to
the
things
that
breathe
in
a
and
little
by
little
the
obscurity
of
the
place
and
hour
seemed
to
envelop
her
she
seemed
to
herself
to
fall
and
writhe
helplessly
in
the
blind
unconsciousness
of
the
night
her
will
became
as
naught
all
sorts
of
black
things
that
seemed
to
have
wings
and
voices
beat
against
her
temples
the
ghastly
temptations
that
afford
madness
a
vague
glimpse
of
crime
caused
a
red
light
the
flash
of
murder
to
pass
before
her
eyes
close
at
hand
and
hands
placed
against
her
back
pushed
her
toward
the
table
where
the
knives
lay
she
would
close
her
eyes
and
move
one
foot
then
fear
would
lay
hold
of
her
and
she
would
cling
to
the
bedclothes
and
at
last
she
would
turn
around
fall
back
upon
the
bed
and
go
to
sleep
beside
the
man
she
had
been
tempted
to
murder
why
she
had
no
idea
for
nothing
for
the
sake
of
killing
and
so
until
daybreak
in
that
wretched
furnished
lodging
the
fierce
struggle
of
those
fatal
passions
would
continue
while
the
poor
maimed
limping
dove
the
infirm
bird
of
venus
nesting
in
one
of
old
shoes
would
utter
now
and
then
awakened
by
the
noise
a
frightened
coo
illustration
chapter
lii
in
the
night
she
would
suddenly
sit
up
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
rest
her
bare
feet
on
the
cold
floor
and
remain
there
listening
to
the
things
that
breathe
in
a
the
ghastly
temptations
that
afford
madness
a
vague
glimpse
of
crime
caused
a
red
light
the
flash
of
murder
to
pass
before
her
eyes
close
at
hand
and
hands
placed
against
her
back
pushed
her
toward
the
table
where
the
knives
liii
in
those
days
gautruche
became
a
little
disgusted
with
drinking
he
felt
the
first
pangs
of
the
disease
of
the
liver
that
had
long
been
lurking
in
his
heated
alcoholized
blood
under
his
cheek
bones
the
horrible
pains
that
gnawed
at
his
side
and
twisted
the
cords
of
his
stomach
for
a
whole
week
caused
him
to
reflect
there
came
to
his
mind
together
with
divers
resolutions
inspired
by
prudence
certain
almost
sentimental
ideas
of
the
future
he
said
to
himself
that
he
must
put
a
little
more
water
into
his
life
if
he
wanted
to
live
to
old
age
while
he
lay
writhing
in
bed
and
tying
himself
into
knots
with
his
knees
up
to
his
chin
to
lessen
the
pain
he
looked
about
at
his
den
the
four
walls
within
which
he
passed
his
nights
to
which
he
brought
his
drunken
body
home
in
the
evening
and
from
which
he
fled
into
the
daylight
in
the
morning
and
he
thought
about
making
a
real
home
for
himself
he
dreamed
of
a
room
where
he
could
keep
a
wife
a
wife
who
would
make
him
a
good
stew
look
after
him
if
he
were
ill
straighten
out
his
affairs
keep
his
linen
in
order
prevent
him
from
beginning
a
new
score
at
the
a
wife
in
short
who
would
combine
all
the
useful
qualities
of
a
housekeeper
and
who
in
addition
would
not
be
a
stupid
fool
but
would
understand
him
and
laugh
with
him
such
a
wife
was
all
found
germinie
was
the
very
one
she
probably
had
a
little
hoard
a
few
sous
laid
by
during
the
time
she
had
been
in
her
old
mistress
service
and
with
what
he
earned
they
could
grub
along
in
comfort
he
had
no
doubt
of
her
consent
he
was
sure
beforehand
that
she
would
accept
his
proposition
more
than
that
her
scruples
if
she
had
any
would
not
hold
out
against
the
prospect
of
marriage
which
he
proposed
to
exhibit
to
her
at
the
end
of
their
one
monday
she
had
come
to
his
room
as
usual
say
germinie
he
began
what
would
you
say
to
this
eh
a
good
room
not
like
this
box
a
real
room
with
a
closet
at
montmartre
and
two
windows
no
less
rue
de
with
a
view
an
englishman
would
give
five
thousand
francs
to
carry
away
with
him
something
bright
and
cheerful
you
know
a
place
where
you
could
stay
all
day
without
hating
yourself
because
i
tell
you
i
beginning
to
have
enough
of
moving
about
here
and
there
just
to
change
fleas
and
that
is
all
either
i
tired
of
being
cooped
up
in
furnished
lodgings
i
tired
of
being
all
alone
friends
do
make
society
they
fall
on
you
like
flies
in
your
glass
when
you
to
pay
and
then
there
you
are
in
the
first
place
i
do
propose
to
drink
any
more
honor
bright
no
more
for
me
you
see
you
understand
i
do
intend
to
use
myself
up
in
this
life
not
if
i
know
myself
not
by
any
means
attention
we
must
let
drink
get
the
better
of
us
it
seemed
to
me
those
days
as
if
i
been
swallowing
corkscrews
and
i
no
desire
to
knock
at
the
monument
just
yet
well
to
go
from
the
thread
to
the
needle
this
is
what
i
thought
i
make
the
proposition
to
germinie
i
treat
myself
to
a
little
furniture
you
got
what
you
have
in
your
room
you
know
i
not
much
of
a
shirker
i
have
a
lazy
bone
in
my
body
where
work
concerned
and
then
we
might
look
to
not
always
be
working
for
others
we
might
take
a
for
country
thieves
if
you
had
a
little
something
put
aside
that
would
help
we
would
join
forces
in
genteel
fashion
and
have
ourselves
straightened
out
some
day
before
the
mayor
that
not
such
a
bad
scheme
is
it
old
girl
eh
and
you
leave
your
old
lady
this
time
wo
you
for
your
dear
old
gautruche
germinie
who
had
listened
to
him
with
her
head
thrust
forward
and
her
chin
resting
on
the
palm
of
her
hand
threw
herself
back
with
a
burst
of
strident
laughter
ha
ha
ha
you
thought
and
you
have
the
face
to
tell
me
so
you
thought
i
leave
her
mademoiselle
did
you
really
think
so
you
a
fool
you
know
why
you
might
have
thousands
and
hundred
thousands
you
might
be
stuffed
with
gold
do
you
hear
all
stuffed
with
it
joking
are
you
mademoiselle
why
do
you
know
have
i
ever
told
you
i
would
like
to
see
her
die
and
these
hands
not
be
there
to
close
her
eyes
i
like
to
see
it
come
now
really
did
you
think
so
damnation
i
imagined
from
the
way
you
acted
with
me
i
thought
you
cared
more
for
me
than
that
that
you
loved
me
in
fact
exclaimed
the
painter
disconcerted
by
the
terrible
stinging
irony
of
words
ah
you
thought
that
too
that
i
loved
you
and
as
if
she
were
suddenly
uprooting
from
the
depths
of
her
heart
the
remorse
and
suffering
of
her
passions
she
continued
well
yes
i
do
love
you
i
love
you
as
you
love
me
just
as
much
and
that
all
i
love
you
as
one
loves
something
that
is
close
at
hand
that
one
makes
use
of
because
it
is
there
i
am
used
to
you
as
one
gets
used
to
an
old
dress
and
wears
it
again
and
again
that
how
i
love
you
how
do
you
suppose
i
should
care
for
you
i
like
you
to
tell
me
what
difference
it
can
make
to
me
whether
it
you
or
another
for
after
all
what
have
you
been
to
me
more
than
any
other
man
would
be
in
the
first
place
you
took
me
well
is
that
enough
to
make
me
love
you
what
have
you
done
then
to
attach
me
to
you
will
you
be
kind
enough
to
tell
me
have
you
ever
sacrificed
a
glass
of
wine
to
me
have
you
even
so
much
as
taken
pity
on
me
when
i
was
tramping
about
in
the
mud
and
snow
at
the
risk
of
my
life
oh
yes
and
what
did
people
say
to
me
and
spit
out
in
my
face
so
that
my
blood
boiled
from
one
end
of
my
body
to
the
other
you
never
troubled
your
head
about
all
the
insults
i
swallowed
waiting
for
you
look
you
i
been
wanting
to
tell
you
all
this
for
a
long
time
it
been
choking
me
tell
me
she
continued
with
a
ghastly
smile
do
you
flatter
yourself
you
driven
me
wild
with
your
physical
beauty
with
your
hair
which
you
lost
with
that
head
of
yours
hardly
i
took
you
i
have
taken
anyone
it
did
matter
who
it
was
one
of
the
times
when
i
had
to
have
someone
at
those
times
i
do
know
anything
or
see
anything
i
not
myself
at
all
i
took
you
because
it
was
a
hot
day
she
paused
an
instant
go
on
said
gautruche
iron
me
on
all
the
seams
do
mind
me
as
long
as
your
hand
in
so
continued
germinie
how
enchanted
you
imagined
i
was
going
to
be
to
take
up
with
you
you
said
to
yourself
fool
she
be
glad
of
the
chance
and
all
i
shall
have
to
do
will
be
to
promise
to
marry
her
she
throw
up
her
place
she
leave
her
mistress
in
the
lurch
the
idea
mademoiselle
mademoiselle
who
has
no
one
but
me
ah
you
do
know
anything
about
such
things

understand
if
i
should
tell
you
mademoiselle
who
is
everything
to
me
why
since
my
mother
died
i
had
nobody
but
her
never
been
treated
kindly
by
anybody
but
her
who
beside
her
ever
said
to
me
when
i
was
unhappy

unhappy
and
when
i
was
sick

feel
well

one

no
one
but
her
to
take
care
of
me

care
what
became
of
me

talk
of
loving
on
account
of
what
there
is
between
us

loved
me

me
and
i
dying
of
it
do
you
know
of
having
become
such
a
miserable
creature
as
i
am
a
she
said
the
word
and
of
deceiving
her
of
stealing
her
affection
of
allowing
her
still
to
love
me
as
her
daughter
ah
if
she
should
ever
learn
anything
but
no
fear
of
that
it
wo
be
long
there
one
woman
who
would
make
a
pretty
leap
out
of
a
window
as
true
as
god
is
my
master
but
fancy
you
are
not
my
heart
you
are
not
my
life
you
are
only
my
pleasure
but
i
did
have
a
man
ah
i
do
know
whether
i
loved
him
but
you
could
have
torn
me
to
pieces
for
him
without
a
word
from
me
in
short
he
was
the
man
that
made
me
what
i
am
well
d
see
when
my
passion
for
him
was
at
its
hottest
when
i
breathed
only
as
he
wished
me
to
when
i
was
mad
over
him
and
would
have
let
him
walk
on
my
stomach
if
he
wanted
to
even
then
if
mademoiselle
had
been
sick
if
she
had
motioned
to
me
with
her
little
finger
i
have
gone
back
to
her
yes
i
would
have
left
him
for
her
i
tell
you
i
would
have
left
him
in
that
case
if
that
the
way
things
stand
my
dear
if
you
so
fond
of
your
old
lady
as
that
i
have
only
one
piece
of
advice
to
give
you
you
better
not
leave
your
good
lady
d
see
that
my
dismissal
is
it
said
germinie
rising
faith
it
very
like
it
well
adieu
that
suits
me
she
went
straight
to
the
door
and
left
the
room
without
a
word
liv
after
this
rupture
germinie
fell
where
she
was
sure
to
fall
below
shame
below
nature
itself
lower
and
lower
the
unhappy
passionate
creature
fell
until
she
wallowed
in
the
gutter
she
took
up
the
lovers
whose
passions
are
exhausted
in
one
night
those
whom
she
passed
or
met
on
the
street
those
whom
chance
throws
in
the
way
of
a
wandering
woman
she
had
no
need
to
give
herself
time
for
the
growth
of
desire
her
caprice
was
fierce
and
sudden
kindled
instantly
pouncing
greedily
upon
the
first
comer
she
hardly
looked
at
him
and
could
not
have
recognized
him
beauty
youth
the
physical
qualities
of
a
lover
in
which
the
passion
of
the
most
degraded
woman
seeks
to
realize
a
base
ideal
as
it
were
none
of
those
things
tempted
her
now
or
touched
her
in
all
men
her
eyes
saw
nothing
but
man
the
individual
mattered
naught
to
her
the
last
indication
of
decency
and
of
human
feeling
in
debauchery
preference
selection
and
even
that
which
represents
all
that
prostitutes
retain
of
conscience
and
personality
disgust
even
disgust
she
had
lost
and
she
wandered
about
the
streets
at
night
with
the
furtive
stealthy
gait
of
wild
beasts
prowling
in
the
shadow
in
quest
of
food
as
if
unsexed
she
made
the
advances
she
solicited
brutes
she
took
advantage
of
drunkenness
and
men
yielded
to
her
she
walked
along
peering
on
every
side
approaching
every
shadowy
corner
where
impurity
might
lurk
under
cover
of
the
darkness
and
solitude
where
hands
were
waiting
to
swoop
down
upon
a
shawl
belated
pedestrians
saw
her
by
the
light
of
the
street
lanterns
an
shuddering
phantom
gliding
along
almost
crawling
bent
double
slinking
by
in
the
shadow
with
that
appearance
of
illness
and
insanity
and
of
utter
aberration
which
sets
the
thoughtful
man
heart
and
the
physician
mind
at
work
on
the
brink
of
deep
abysses
of
melancholy
lv
one
evening
when
she
was
prowling
about
rue
du
rocher
as
she
passed
a
at
the
corner
of
rue
de
labarde
she
noticed
the
back
of
a
man
who
was
drinking
at
the
bar
it
was
jupillon
she
stopped
short
turned
toward
the
street
with
her
back
against
the
door
of
the
and
waited
the
light
in
the
shop
was
behind
her
her
shoulders
against
the
bars
and
there
she
stood
motionless
her
skirt
gathered
up
in
one
hand
in
front
and
her
other
hand
falling
listlessly
at
her
side
she
resembled
a
statue
of
darkness
seated
on
a
milestone
in
her
attitude
there
was
an
air
of
stern
determination
and
the
necessary
patience
to
wait
there
forever
the
the
carriages
the
street
she
saw
them
all
indistinctly
and
as
if
they
were
far
away
the
waiting
to
assist
in
drawing
the
omnibuses
up
the
hill
a
white
horse
he
was
stood
in
front
of
her
worn
out
and
motionless
sleeping
on
his
feet
with
his
head
and
forefeet
in
the
bright
light
from
the
door
she
did
not
see
him
there
was
a
dense
fog
it
was
one
of
those
vile
detestable
parisian
nights
when
it
seems
as
if
the
water
that
falls
had
become
mud
before
falling
the
gutter
rose
and
flowed
about
her
feet
she
remained
thus
half
an
hour
without
moving
with
her
back
to
the
light
and
her
face
in
the
shadow
a
threatening
desperate
forbidding
creature
like
a
statue
of
fatality
erected
by
darkness
at
a
door
at
last
jupillon
came
out
she
stood
before
him
with
folded
arms
my
money
she
said
her
face
was
that
of
a
woman
who
has
ceased
to
possess
a
conscience
for
whom
there
is
no
god
no
police
no
assizes
no
scaffold
nothing
jupillon
felt
that
his
customary
was
arrested
in
his
throat
your
money
he
repeated
your
money
ai
lost
but
i
must
have
time
just
now
you
see
work
ai
very
plenty
that
shop
business
of
mine
came
to
grief
a
long
while
ago
you
know
but
in
three
months
time
i
promise
are
you
pretty
well
ah
i
got
you
now
ah
you
sneak
away
would
you
but
it
was
you
my
curse
it
was
you
who
made
me
what
i
am
brigand
robber
sneak
it
was
you
germinie
hurled
these
words
in
his
face
pushing
against
him
forcing
him
back
pressing
her
body
against
his
she
seemed
to
be
rubbing
against
the
blows
that
she
invited
and
provoked
and
as
she
leaned
toward
him
thus
she
cried
come
strike
me
what
then
must
i
say
to
you
to
make
you
strike
me
she
had
ceased
to
think
she
did
not
know
what
she
wanted
she
simply
felt
that
she
needed
to
be
struck
there
had
come
upon
her
an
instinctive
irrational
desire
to
be
maltreated
bruised
made
to
suffer
in
her
flesh
to
experience
a
violent
shock
a
sharp
pain
that
would
put
a
stop
to
what
was
going
on
in
her
brain
she
could
think
of
nothing
but
blows
to
bring
matters
to
a
crisis
after
the
blows
she
saw
with
the
lucidity
of
an
hallucination
all
sorts
of
things
come
to
pass
the
guard
arriving
the
gendarmes
from
the
post
the
commissioner
the
commissioner
to
whom
she
could
tell
everything
her
story
her
misfortunes
how
the
man
before
her
had
abused
her
and
what
he
had
cost
her
her
heart
collapsed
in
anticipation
at
the
thought
of
emptying
itself
with
shrieks
and
tears
of
everything
with
which
it
was
bursting
come
strike
me
she
repeated
still
advancing
upon
jupillon
who
tried
to
slink
away
and
as
he
retreated
tossed
caressing
words
to
her
as
you
do
to
a
dog
that
does
not
recognize
you
and
seems
inclined
to
bite
a
crowd
was
beginning
to
collect
about
them
come
old
harridan
do
bother
monsieur
exclaimed
a
police
officer
grasping
germinie
by
the
arm
and
swinging
her
around
roughly
under
that
brutal
insult
from
the
hand
of
the
law
germinie
knees
wavered
she
thought
she
should
faint
then
she
was
afraid
and
fled
in
the
middle
of
the
street
lvi
passion
is
subject
to
the
most
insensate
reactions
the
most
inexplicable
revivals
the
accursed
love
that
germinie
believed
to
have
been
killed
by
all
the
wounds
and
blows
jupillon
had
inflicted
upon
it
came
to
life
once
more
she
was
dismayed
to
find
it
in
her
heart
when
she
returned
home
the
mere
sight
of
the
man
his
proximity
for
those
few
moments
the
sound
of
his
voice
the
act
of
breathing
the
air
that
he
breathed
were
enough
to
turn
her
heart
back
to
him
and
relegate
her
to
the
past
notwithstanding
all
that
had
happened
she
had
never
been
able
to
tear
jupillon
image
altogether
from
her
heart
its
roots
were
still
imbedded
there
he
was
her
first
love
she
belonged
to
him
against
her
own
will
by
all
the
weaknesses
of
memory
by
all
the
cowardice
of
habit
between
them
there
were
all
the
bonds
of
torture
that
hold
a
woman
fast
forever
sacrifice
suffering
degradation
he
owned
her
body
and
soul
because
he
had
outraged
her
conscience
trampled
upon
her
illusions
made
her
life
a
martyrdom
she
belonged
to
him
belonged
to
him
forever
as
to
the
author
of
all
her
sorrows
and
that
shock
that
scene
which
should
have
caused
her
to
think
with
horror
of
ever
meeting
him
again
rekindled
in
her
the
frenzied
desire
to
meet
him
again
her
passion
seized
her
again
in
its
full
force
the
thought
of
jupillon
filled
her
mind
so
completely
that
it
purified
her
she
abruptly
called
a
halt
in
the
vagabondage
of
her
passions
she
determined
to
belong
thenceforth
to
no
one
as
that
was
the
only
method
by
which
she
could
still
belong
to
him
she
began
to
spy
upon
him
to
make
a
study
of
his
usual
hours
for
going
out
the
streets
he
passed
through
the
places
that
he
visited
she
followed
him
to
batignolles
to
his
new
quarters
walked
behind
him
content
to
put
her
foot
where
he
had
put
his
to
be
guided
by
his
steps
to
see
him
now
and
then
to
notice
a
gesture
that
he
made
to
snatch
one
of
his
glances
that
was
all
she
dared
not
speak
to
him
she
kept
at
some
distance
behind
like
a
lost
dog
happy
not
to
be
driven
away
with
kicks
for
weeks
and
weeks
she
made
herself
thus
the
man
shadow
a
humble
timid
shadow
that
shrank
back
and
moved
away
a
few
steps
when
it
thought
it
was
in
danger
of
being
seen
then
drew
nearer
again
with
faltering
steps
and
at
an
impatient
movement
from
the
man
stopped
once
more
as
if
asking
pardon
sometimes
she
waited
at
the
door
of
a
house
which
he
entered
caught
him
up
again
when
he
came
out
and
escorted
him
home
always
at
a
distance
without
speaking
to
him
with
the
air
of
a
beggar
begging
for
crumbs
and
thankful
for
what
she
was
allowed
to
pick
up
then
she
would
listen
at
the
shutters
of
the
apartment
in
which
he
lived
to
ascertain
if
he
was
alone
if
there
was
anybody
there
when
he
had
a
woman
on
his
arm
although
she
suffered
keenly
she
was
the
more
persistent
in
following
him
she
went
where
they
went
to
the
end
she
entered
the
public
gardens
and
ballrooms
behind
them
she
walked
within
sound
of
their
laughter
and
their
words
tore
her
heart
to
tatters
looking
at
them
and
listening
to
them
and
stood
at
their
backs
with
every
jealous
instinct
of
her
nature
bleeding
lvii
it
was
november
for
three
or
four
days
germinie
had
not
fallen
in
with
jupillon
she
went
to
hover
about
his
lodgings
watching
for
him
when
she
reached
the
street
on
which
he
lived
she
saw
a
broad
beam
of
light
struggling
out
through
the
closed
shutters
she
approached
and
heard
bursts
of
laughter
the
clinking
of
glasses
women
voices
then
a
song
and
one
voice
that
of
the
woman
whom
she
hated
with
all
the
hatred
of
her
heart
whom
she
would
have
liked
to
see
lying
dead
before
her
and
whose
death
she
had
so
often
sought
to
discover
in
the
the
cousin
she
glued
her
ear
to
the
shutter
breathing
in
what
they
said
absorbed
in
the
torture
of
listening
to
them
pasturing
her
famished
heart
upon
suffering
it
was
a
cold
rainy
winter
night
she
did
not
feel
the
cold
or
rain
all
her
senses
were
engaged
in
listening
the
voice
she
detested
seemed
at
times
to
grow
faint
and
die
away
beneath
kisses
and
the
notes
it
sang
died
in
her
throat
as
if
stifled
by
lips
placed
upon
the
song
the
hours
passed
germinie
was
still
at
her
post
she
did
not
think
of
going
away
she
waited
with
no
knowledge
of
what
she
was
waiting
for
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
must
remain
there
always
until
the
end
the
rain
fell
faster
the
water
from
a
broken
gutter
overhead
beat
down
upon
her
shoulders
great
drops
glided
down
her
neck
an
icy
shiver
ran
up
and
down
her
back
the
water
dripped
from
her
dress
to
the
ground
she
did
not
notice
it
she
was
conscious
of
no
pain
in
any
of
her
limbs
except
the
pain
that
flowed
from
her
heart
well
on
toward
morning
there
was
a
movement
in
the
house
and
footsteps
approached
the
door
germinie
ran
and
hid
in
a
recess
in
the
wall
some
steps
away
and
from
there
saw
a
woman
come
out
escorted
by
a
young
man
as
she
watched
them
walk
away
she
felt
something
soft
and
warm
on
her
hands
that
frightened
her
at
first
it
was
a
dog
licking
her
a
great
dog
that
she
had
held
in
her
lap
many
an
evening
when
he
was
a
puppy
in
the
back
shop
come
here
molosse
jupillon
shouted
impatiently
twice
or
thrice
in
the
darkness
the
dog
barked
ran
back
returned
and
gamboled
about
her
and
at
last
entered
the
house
the
door
closed
the
voices
and
singing
lured
germinie
back
to
her
former
position
against
the
shutter
and
there
she
remained
drenched
by
the
rain
allowing
herself
to
be
drenched
as
she
listened
and
listened
till
morning
till
daybreak
till
the
hour
when
the
masons
on
their
way
to
work
with
their
dinner
loaf
under
their
arms
began
to
laugh
at
her
as
they
passed
lviii
two
or
three
days
after
that
night
in
the
rain
germinie
features
were
distorted
with
pain
her
skin
was
like
marble
and
her
eyes
blazing
she
said
nothing
made
no
complaints
but
went
about
her
work
as
usual
here
girl
look
at
me
a
moment
said
mademoiselle
and
she
led
her
abruptly
to
the
window
what
does
all
this
mean
this
look
of
a
dead
woman
risen
from
the
grave
come
tell
me
honestly
are
you
sick
my
god
how
hot
your
hands
are
she
grasped
her
wrist
and
in
a
moment
threw
it
down
what
a
silly
slut
you
in
a
burning
fever
and
you
keep
it
to
yourself
why
no
mademoiselle
germinie
stammered
i
think
it
nothing
but
a
bad
cold
i
went
to
sleep
the
other
evening
with
my
kitchen
window
open
oh
you
a
good
one
retorted
mademoiselle
you
might
be
dying
and
you
never
as
much
as
say
wait
she
put
on
her
spectacles
and
hastily
moving
her
to
a
small
table
by
the
fireplace
she
wrote
a
few
lines
in
her
bold
hand
here
said
she
folding
the
note
you
will
do
me
the
favor
to
give
this
to
your
friend
adèle
and
have
her
send
the
concierge
with
it
and
now
to
bed
you
go
but
germinie
refused
to
go
to
bed
it
was
not
worth
while
she
would
not
tire
herself
she
would
sit
down
all
day
besides
the
worst
of
her
sickness
was
over
she
was
getting
better
already
and
then
it
always
killed
her
to
stay
in
bed
the
doctor
summoned
by
mademoiselle
note
came
in
the
evening
he
examined
germinie
and
ordered
the
application
of
croton
oil
the
trouble
in
the
chest
was
of
such
a
nature
that
he
could
say
nothing
about
it
until
he
had
observed
the
effect
of
his
remedies
he
returned
a
few
days
later
sent
germinie
to
bed
and
sounded
her
chest
for
a
long
while
it
a
most
extraordinary
thing
he
said
to
mademoiselle
when
he
went
downstairs
she
has
had
pleurisy
upon
her
and
has
kept
her
bed
for
a
moment
is
she
made
of
iron
in
heaven
name
oh
the
energy
of
some
women
how
old
is
she
oh
it
not
possible
are
you
sure
she
looks
fully
fifty
ah
as
to
that
she
looks
as
old
as
you
please
what
can
you
expect
never
in
good
health
always
sick
disappointment
sorrow
and
a
disposition
that
ca
help
tormenting
itself
years
old
it
amazing
the
physician
repeated
after
a
moment
reflection
he
continued
so
far
as
you
know
is
there
any
hereditary
lung
trouble
in
her
family
has
she
had
any
relatives
who
have
died
young
she
lost
a
sister
by
pleurisy
but
she
was
older
she
was
i
think
the
doctor
had
become
very
grave
however
the
lung
is
getting
freer
he
said
in
an
encouraging
tone
but
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
she
should
have
rest
and
send
her
to
me
once
a
week
let
her
come
and
see
me
and
let
her
take
a
pleasant
day
for
it
a
bright
sunny
day
lix
mademoiselle
talked
and
prayed
and
implored
and
scolded
to
no
purpose
she
could
not
induce
germinie
to
lay
aside
her
work
for
a
few
days
germinie
would
not
even
listen
to
the
suggestion
that
she
should
have
an
assistant
to
do
the
heavier
work
she
declared
that
it
was
useless
impossible
that
she
could
never
endure
the
thought
of
another
woman
approaching
her
waiting
upon
her
attending
to
her
wants
that
it
would
give
her
a
fever
simply
to
think
of
such
a
thing
as
she
lay
in
bed
that
she
was
not
dead
yet
and
she
begged
that
she
might
be
allowed
to
go
on
as
usual
so
long
as
she
could
put
one
foot
before
the
other
she
said
it
in
such
an
affectionate
tone
her
eyes
were
so
beseeching
her
feeble
voice
was
so
humble
and
so
passionate
in
making
the
request
that
mademoiselle
had
not
the
courage
to
force
her
to
accept
an
assistant
she
simply
called
her
a
blockhead
who
believed
like
all
that
a
few
days
in
bed
means
death
keeping
on
her
feet
with
an
apparent
improvement
due
to
the
energetic
treatment
germinie
continued
to
make
mademoiselle
bed
accepting
her
assistance
to
turn
the
mattresses
she
also
continued
to
prepare
her
food
and
that
was
an
especially
distasteful
task
to
her
when
she
was
preparing
mademoiselle
breakfast
and
dinner
she
felt
as
if
she
should
die
in
her
kitchen
one
of
the
wretched
little
kitchens
common
in
great
cities
which
are
the
cause
of
so
much
pulmonary
trouble
in
women
the
embers
that
she
kindled
and
from
which
a
thread
of
suffocating
smoke
slowly
arose
began
to
stir
her
stomach
to
revolt
soon
the
charcoal
that
she
bought
from
the
charcoal
dealer
next
door
strong
paris
charcoal
full
of
wood
enveloped
her
in
its
stifling
odor
the
dirty
smoking
funnel
the
low
poured
back
into
her
lungs
the
corroding
heat
of
the
oven
she
suffocated
she
felt
the
fiery
heat
of
all
her
blood
surge
upward
to
her
face
and
cause
red
blotches
to
appear
on
her
forehead
her
head
whirled
in
the
condition
of
laundresses
who
pass
back
and
forth
through
the
vapor
of
their
charcoal
stoves
she
would
rush
to
the
window
and
draw
a
few
breaths
of
the
icy
outside
air
she
had
other
motives
for
suffering
on
her
feet
for
keeping
constantly
about
her
work
despite
her
increasing
weakness
than
the
repugnance
of
to
take
to
their
beds
or
her
fierce
jealous
determination
that
no
one
but
herself
should
attend
to
needs
she
had
a
constant
terror
of
denunciation
which
might
accompany
the
installation
of
a
new
servant
it
was
absolutely
necessary
that
she
should
be
there
to
keep
watch
on
mademoiselle
and
prevent
anyone
from
coming
near
her
it
was
necessary
too
that
she
should
show
herself
that
the
quarter
should
see
her
and
that
she
should
not
appear
to
her
creditors
with
the
aspect
of
a
dead
woman
she
must
make
a
pretence
of
being
strong
she
must
assume
a
cheerful
lively
demeanor
she
must
impart
confidence
to
the
whole
street
with
the
doctor
studied
words
with
a
hopeful
air
and
with
the
promise
not
to
die
she
must
appear
at
her
best
in
order
to
reassure
her
debtors
and
to
prevent
apprehensions
on
the
subject
of
money
from
ascending
the
stairs
and
applying
to
mademoiselle
she
acted
up
to
her
part
in
this
horrible
but
necessary
comedy
she
was
absolutely
heroic
in
the
way
she
made
her
whole
body
lie
in
drawing
up
her
enfeebled
form
to
its
full
height
as
she
passed
the
shops
whose
proprietors
eyes
were
upon
her
in
quickening
her
trailing
footsteps
in
rubbing
her
cheeks
with
a
rough
towel
before
going
out
in
order
to
bring
back
the
color
of
blood
to
them
in
covering
the
pallor
of
her
disease
and
her
with
rouge
despite
the
terrible
cough
that
racked
her
sleepless
nights
despite
her
stomach
loathing
for
food
she
passed
the
whole
winter
conquering
and
overcoming
her
own
weakness
and
struggling
with
the
ups
and
downs
of
her
disease
at
every
visit
that
he
made
the
doctor
told
mademoiselle
that
he
was
unable
to
find
that
any
of
her
maid
vital
organs
were
seriously
diseased
the
lungs
were
a
little
ulcerated
near
the
top
but
people
recovered
from
that
but
her
body
seems
worn
out
thoroughly
worn
out
he
said
again
and
again
in
a
sad
tone
with
an
almost
embarrassed
manner
that
impressed
mademoiselle
and
he
always
had
something
to
say
at
the
end
of
his
visit
about
a
change
of
air
about
the
country
lx
when
august
arrived
the
doctor
had
nothing
but
that
to
advise
or
prescribe
the
country
notwithstanding
the
repugnance
of
elderly
people
to
move
to
change
their
abode
and
the
habits
and
regular
hours
of
their
life
despite
her
domestic
nature
and
the
sort
of
pang
that
she
felt
at
being
torn
from
her
hearthstone
mademoiselle
decided
to
take
germinie
into
the
country
she
wrote
to
the
daughter
who
lived
with
a
brood
of
children
on
a
small
estate
in
a
village
of
brie
and
who
had
been
for
many
years
begging
her
to
pay
her
a
long
visit
she
requested
her
hospitality
for
a
month
or
six
weeks
for
herself
and
her
sick
maid
they
set
out
germinie
was
delighted
on
their
arrival
she
felt
decidedly
better
for
some
days
her
disease
seemed
to
be
diverted
by
the
change
but
the
weather
that
summer
was
very
uncertain
with
much
rain
sudden
changes
and
high
winds
germinie
had
a
chill
and
mademoiselle
soon
heard
again
overhead
just
above
the
room
in
which
she
slept
the
frightful
cough
that
had
been
so
painful
and
hard
to
bear
at
paris
there
were
hurried
paroxysms
of
coughing
that
seemed
almost
to
strangle
her
spasms
that
would
break
off
for
a
moment
then
begin
again
and
the
pauses
caused
the
ear
and
the
heart
to
experience
a
nervous
anxious
anticipation
of
what
was
certain
to
come
next
and
always
did
come
racking
and
tearing
dying
away
again
but
still
vibrating
in
the
ear
even
when
it
had
ceased
never
silent
never
willing
to
have
done
and
yet
germinie
rose
from
those
horrible
nights
with
an
energy
and
activity
that
amazed
mademoiselle
and
at
times
reassured
her
she
was
out
of
bed
as
early
as
anybody
in
the
house
one
morning
at
five
she
went
with
the
in
a
to
a
three
leagues
away
for
fish
at
another
time
she
dragged
herself
to
the
saint
day
ball
with
the
maids
from
the
house
and
did
not
return
until
they
did
at
daybreak
she
worked
all
the
time
assisted
the
servants
she
was
always
sitting
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
in
a
corner
of
the
kitchen
doing
something
with
her
fingers
mademoiselle
was
obliged
to
force
her
to
go
out
to
drive
her
into
the
garden
to
sit
then
germinie
would
sit
on
the
green
bench
with
her
umbrella
over
her
head
and
the
sun
in
her
skirts
and
on
her
feet
hardly
moving
she
would
forget
herself
utterly
as
she
inhaled
the
light
and
air
and
warmth
passionately
and
with
a
sort
of
feverish
joy
her
distended
lips
would
part
to
admit
the
fresh
clear
air
her
eyes
burned
but
did
not
move
and
in
the
light
shadow
of
the
silk
umbrella
her
gaunt
wasted
haggard
face
stared
vacantly
into
space
like
an
amorous
death
head
weary
as
she
was
at
night
no
persuasion
could
induce
her
to
retire
before
her
mistress
she
insisted
upon
being
at
hand
to
undress
her
seated
by
her
side
she
would
rise
from
time
to
time
to
wait
upon
her
as
best
she
could
assist
her
to
take
off
a
petticoat
then
sit
down
again
collect
her
strength
for
a
moment
rise
again
and
insist
upon
doing
something
for
her
mademoiselle
had
to
force
her
to
sit
down
and
order
her
to
keep
quiet
and
all
the
time
that
the
evening
toilet
lasted
she
had
always
upon
her
lips
the
same
tiresome
chatter
about
the
servants
of
the
house
why
mademoiselle
you
have
an
idea
of
the
eyes
they
make
at
each
other
when
they
think
no
one
sees
them
the
cook
and
the
man
i
mean
they
keep
quiet
when
i
am
by
but
the
other
day
i
surprised
them
in
the
bakery
they
were
kissing
fancy
luckily
madame
here
do
suspect
it
ah
there
you
are
again
with
your
why
good
god
mademoiselle
would
exclaim
what
difference
does
it
make
to
you
whether
they
or
do
they
kind
to
you
are
they
that
all
that
necessary
oh
very
kind
mademoiselle
as
far
as
that
concerned
i
have
a
word
to
say
marie
got
up
in
the
night
last
night
to
give
me
some
water
and
as
for
him
when
there
any
dessert
left
it
always
for
me
oh
he
very
polite
to
me
in
fact
marie
do
like
it
very
well
that
he
thinks
so
much
about
me
you
understand
mademoiselle
come
come
go
to
bed
with
all
your
nonsense
said
her
mistress
sharply
sad
and
annoyed
as
well
to
find
such
a
keen
interest
in
others
in
one
so
lxi
when
they
returned
from
the
country
the
doctor
after
examining
germinie
said
to
mademoiselle
it
has
been
very
rapid
very
rapid
the
left
lung
is
entirely
gone
the
right
has
begun
to
be
affected
at
the
top
and
i
fear
that
there
is
more
or
less
difficulty
all
through
it
she
a
dead
woman
she
may
live
six
weeks
two
months
at
most
great
heaven
said
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
everyone
i
have
ever
loved
will
go
before
me
tell
me
must
i
wait
until
everybody
has
gone
have
you
thought
of
placing
her
in
some
institution
said
the
doctor
after
a
moment
silence
you
ca
keep
her
here
it
too
great
a
burden
too
great
a
grief
for
you
to
have
her
with
you
he
added
at
a
gesture
from
mademoiselle
no
monsieur
no
i
have
thought
of
it
oh
yes
i
am
likely
to
send
her
away
why
you
must
have
seen
monsieur
that
girl
is
a
maid
she
is
a
servant
in
my
eyes
she
like
the
family
i
never
had
what
would
you
have
me
say
to
her
off
with
you
now
ah
i
never
suffered
so
much
before
on
account
of
not
being
rich
and
having
a
wretched
apartment
like
this
i
mention
such
a
thing
to
her
why
it
impossible
and
where
could
she
go
to
the
maison
dubois
oh
yes
to
the
dubois
she
went
there
once
to
see
the
maid
i
had
before
who
died
there
you
might
as
well
kill
her
the
hospital
then
no
not
there
i
do
choose
to
have
her
die
in
that
place
good
god
mademoiselle
she
be
a
hundred
times
better
off
there
than
here
i
would
get
her
admitted
at
lariboisière
during
the
term
of
service
of
a
doctor
who
is
a
friend
of
mine
i
would
recommend
her
to
an
intern
who
is
under
great
obligations
to
me
she
would
have
a
very
excellent
sister
to
nurse
her
in
the
hall
to
which
i
would
have
her
sent
if
necessary
she
could
have
a
private
room
but
i
am
sure
she
would
prefer
to
be
in
a
common
room
it
the
essential
thing
to
do
you
see
mademoiselle
she
ca
stay
in
that
chamber
up
there
you
know
what
these
horrible
servants
quarters
are
indeed
it
my
opinion
that
the
health
authorities
ought
to
compel
the
landlords
to
show
common
humanity
in
that
direction
it
an
outrage
the
cold
weather
is
coming
there
no
fireplace
with
the
window
and
the
roof
it
will
be
like
an
you
see
she
still
keeps
about
she
has
a
marvelous
stock
of
courage
prodigious
nervous
vitality
but
in
spite
of
everything
the
bed
will
claim
her
in
a
few
days
she
wo
get
up
again
come
listen
to
reason
mademoiselle
let
me
speak
to
her
will
you
no
not
yet
i
must
get
used
to
the
idea
and
then
when
i
see
her
around
me
i
imagine
she
is
going
to
die
so
quickly
as
all
that
there
time
enough
later
we
see
about
it
yes
later
excuse
me
mademoiselle
if
i
venture
to
say
to
you
that
you
are
quite
capable
of
making
yourself
sick
nursing
her
i
oh
as
for
me
and
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
made
a
gesture
indicating
that
her
life
was
of
no
consequence
lxii
amid
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
desperate
anxiety
concerning
her
maid
health
she
became
conscious
of
a
strange
feeling
a
sort
of
fear
in
the
presence
of
the
new
unfamiliar
mysterious
creature
that
sickness
had
made
of
germinie
mademoiselle
had
a
sense
of
discomfort
beside
that
hollow
ghostly
face
which
was
almost
unrecognizable
in
its
implacable
rigidity
and
which
seemed
to
return
to
itself
to
recover
consciousness
only
furtively
by
fits
and
starts
in
the
effort
to
produce
a
pallid
smile
the
old
woman
had
seen
many
people
die
her
memories
of
many
painful
years
recalled
the
expressions
of
many
dear
doomed
faces
of
many
faces
that
were
sad
and
desolate
and
in
death
but
no
face
of
all
those
she
remembered
had
ever
assumed
as
the
end
drew
near
that
distressing
expression
of
a
face
retiring
within
itself
and
closing
the
doors
enveloped
in
her
suffering
germinie
maintained
her
savage
rigid
impenetrable
demeanor
she
was
as
immovable
as
bronze
mademoiselle
as
she
looked
at
her
asked
herself
what
it
could
be
that
she
brooded
over
thus
without
moving
whether
it
was
her
life
rising
in
revolt
the
dread
of
death
or
a
secret
remorse
for
something
in
her
past
nothing
external
seemed
to
affect
the
sick
woman
she
was
no
longer
conscious
of
things
about
her
her
body
became
indifferent
to
everything
did
not
ask
to
be
relieved
seemed
not
to
desire
to
be
cured
she
complained
of
nothing
found
no
pleasure
or
diversion
in
anything
even
her
longing
for
affection
had
left
her
she
no
longer
made
any
motion
to
bestow
or
invite
a
caress
and
every
day
something
human
left
her
body
which
seemed
to
be
turning
to
stone
often
she
would
bury
herself
in
profound
silence
that
made
one
expect
a
shriek
or
word
but
after
glancing
about
the
room
she
would
say
nothing
and
begin
again
to
stare
fixedly
vacantly
at
the
same
spot
in
space
when
mademoiselle
returned
from
the
friend
house
with
whom
she
dined
she
would
find
germinie
in
the
dark
sunk
in
an
with
her
legs
stretched
out
upon
a
chair
her
head
hanging
forward
on
her
breast
and
so
profoundly
absorbed
that
sometimes
she
did
not
hear
the
door
open
as
she
walked
forward
into
the
room
it
seemed
to
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
as
if
she
were
breaking
in
upon
a
ghastly
between
disease
and
the
shadow
of
death
wherein
germinie
was
already
seeking
in
the
terror
of
the
invisible
the
blindness
of
the
grave
and
the
darkness
of
death
lxiii
throughout
the
month
of
october
germinie
obstinately
refused
to
take
to
her
bed
each
day
however
she
was
weaker
and
more
helpless
than
the
day
before
she
was
hardly
able
to
ascend
the
flight
of
stairs
that
led
to
her
sixth
floor
dragging
herself
along
by
the
railing
one
day
she
fell
on
the
stairs
the
other
servants
picked
her
up
and
carried
her
to
her
chamber
but
that
did
not
stop
her
the
next
day
she
went
downstairs
again
with
the
fitful
gleam
of
strength
that
invalids
commonly
have
in
the
morning
she
prepared
mademoiselle
breakfast
made
a
pretence
of
working
and
kept
moving
about
the
apartment
clinging
to
the
chairs
and
dragging
herself
along
mademoiselle
took
pity
on
her
she
forced
her
to
lie
down
on
her
own
bed
germinie
lay
there
half
an
hour
an
hour
wide
awake
not
speaking
but
with
her
eyes
open
fixed
and
staring
into
vacancy
like
the
eyes
of
a
person
in
severe
pain
one
morning
she
did
not
come
down
mademoiselle
climbed
to
the
sixth
floor
turned
into
a
narrow
corridor
in
which
the
air
was
heavy
with
the
odors
from
servants
and
at
last
reached
germinie
door
no
germinie
apologized
for
having
compelled
her
to
come
up
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
put
her
feet
out
of
the
bed
she
had
terrible
pains
in
her
bowels
and
they
were
badly
swollen
she
begged
mademoiselle
to
sit
down
a
moment
and
to
make
room
for
her
removed
the
candlestick
that
stood
on
the
chair
at
the
head
of
her
bed
mademoiselle
sat
down
and
remained
a
few
moments
looking
about
the
wretched
room
one
of
those
where
the
doctor
has
to
lay
his
hat
on
the
bed
and
where
there
is
barely
room
to
die
it
was
a
small
attic
room
without
a
chimney
with
a
scuttle
window
in
the
sloping
roof
which
admitted
the
heat
of
summer
and
the
cold
of
winter
old
trunks
clothes
bags
a
and
the
little
iron
bedstead
on
which
niece
had
slept
were
heaped
up
in
a
corner
under
the
sloping
roof
the
bed
one
chair
a
little
disabled
washstand
with
a
broken
pitcher
comprised
the
whole
of
the
furniture
above
the
bed
in
an
imitation
frame
hung
a
daguerreotype
of
a
man
the
doctor
came
during
the
day
aha
peritonitis
he
said
when
mademoiselle
described
germinie
condition
he
went
up
to
see
the
sick
woman
i
am
afraid
he
said
when
he
came
down
that
there
an
abscess
in
the
intestine
communicating
with
an
abscess
in
the
bladder
it
a
serious
case
very
serious
you
must
tell
her
not
to
move
about
much
in
her
bed
to
turn
over
with
great
care
she
might
die
suddenly
in
horrible
agony
i
suggested
to
her
to
go
to
lariboisière
she
agreed
at
once
she
seemed
to
have
no
repugnance
at
all
but
i
do
know
how
she
will
bear
the
journey
however
she
has
such
an
unlimited
stock
of
energy
i
have
never
seen
anything
like
it
morning
you
shall
have
the
order
of
admission
when
mademoiselle
went
up
to
germinie
room
again
she
found
her
smiling
in
her
bed
gay
as
a
lark
at
the
idea
of
going
away
it
a
matter
of
six
weeks
at
most
mademoiselle
said
she
lxiv
at
two
the
next
day
the
doctor
brought
the
order
for
her
admission
to
lariboisière
the
invalid
was
ready
to
start
mademoiselle
suggested
that
they
should
send
to
the
hospital
for
a
litter
oh
no
said
germinie
hastily
i
should
think
i
was
dead
she
was
thinking
of
her
debts
she
must
show
herself
to
her
creditors
on
the
street
alive
and
on
her
feet
to
the
last
she
got
out
of
bed
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
assisted
her
to
put
on
her
petticoat
and
her
dress
as
soon
as
she
left
her
bed
all
signs
of
life
disappeared
from
her
face
the
flush
from
her
complexion
it
seemed
as
if
earth
suddenly
took
the
place
of
blood
under
her
skin
she
went
down
the
steep
servants
stairway
clinging
to
the
baluster
and
reached
her
mistress
apartments
she
sat
down
in
an
near
the
window
in
the
she
insisted
upon
putting
on
her
stockings
without
assistance
and
as
she
pulled
them
on
with
her
poor
trembling
hands
the
fingers
striking
against
one
another
she
afforded
a
glimpse
of
her
legs
which
were
so
thin
as
to
make
one
shudder
the
housekeeper
meanwhile
was
putting
together
in
a
bundle
a
little
linen
a
glass
a
cup
and
a
pewter
plate
which
she
wished
to
carry
with
her
when
that
was
done
germinie
looked
about
her
for
a
moment
she
cast
one
last
glance
around
the
room
a
glance
that
seemed
to
long
to
take
everything
away
with
her
then
as
her
eyes
rested
on
the
door
through
which
the
housekeeper
had
just
gone
out
she
said
to
mademoiselle
at
all
events
i
leave
a
good
woman
with
you
she
rose
the
door
closed
noisily
behind
her
as
if
to
say
adieu
and
supported
by
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
who
almost
carried
her
she
went
down
the
five
flights
of
the
main
stairway
at
every
landing
she
paused
to
take
breath
in
the
vestibule
she
found
the
concierge
who
had
brought
her
a
chair
she
fell
into
it
the
vulgar
fellow
laughingly
promised
her
that
she
would
be
well
in
six
weeks
she
moved
her
head
slightly
as
she
said
a
muffled
she
was
in
the
cab
beside
her
mistress
it
was
an
uncomfortable
cab
and
jolted
over
the
pavements
she
sat
forward
on
the
seat
to
avoid
the
concussion
of
the
jolting
and
clung
to
the
door
with
her
hand
she
watched
the
houses
pass
but
did
not
speak
when
they
reached
the
hospital
gate
she
refused
to
be
carried
can
you
walk
as
far
as
that
said
the
concierge
pointing
to
the
some
sixty
feet
distant
she
made
an
affirmative
sign
and
walked
it
was
a
dead
woman
walking
because
she
was
determined
to
walk
at
last
she
reached
the
great
hall
cold
and
stiff
and
clean
and
bare
and
horrible
with
a
circle
of
wooden
benches
around
the
waiting
litter
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
led
her
to
a
straw
chair
near
a
glazed
door
a
clerk
opened
the
door
asked
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
name
and
age
and
wrote
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
covering
ten
or
more
sheets
of
paper
with
a
religious
emblem
at
the
top
that
done
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
kissed
her
and
turned
to
go
she
saw
an
attendant
take
her
under
the
arms
then
she
saw
no
more
but
turned
and
fled
and
throwing
herself
upon
the
cushions
of
the
cab
she
burst
into
sobs
and
gave
vent
to
all
the
tears
with
which
her
heart
had
been
suffocated
for
an
hour
past
the
driver
on
his
box
was
amazed
to
hear
such
violent
weeping
lxv
on
the
visiting
day
thursday
mademoiselle
started
at
twelve
to
go
and
see
germinie
it
was
her
purpose
to
be
at
her
bedside
at
the
moment
the
doors
were
thrown
open
at
one
precisely
as
she
rode
through
the
streets
she
had
passed
through
four
days
before
she
remembered
the
ghastly
ride
of
monday
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
she
were
incommoding
a
sick
person
in
the
cab
of
which
she
was
the
only
occupant
and
she
sat
close
in
the
corner
in
order
to
make
room
for
the
memory
of
germinie
in
what
condition
should
she
find
her
should
she
find
her
at
all
suppose
her
bed
should
be
empty
the
cab
passed
through
a
narrow
street
filled
with
orange
carts
and
with
women
sitting
on
the
sidewalk
offering
biscuit
for
sale
in
baskets
there
was
something
unspeakably
wretched
and
dismal
in
this
display
of
fruit
and
cakes
the
delicacies
of
the
dying
the
of
invalids
craved
by
feverish
mouths
longed
for
by
the
which
workingmen
hands
black
with
toil
purchase
as
they
pass
to
carry
to
the
hospital
and
offer
death
a
tempting
morsel
children
carried
them
with
sober
faces
almost
reverentially
and
without
touching
them
as
if
they
understood
the
cab
stopped
before
the
gate
of
the
courtyard
it
was
five
minutes
to
one
there
was
a
long
line
of
women
crowding
about
the
gate
women
with
their
working
clothes
on
sorrowful
depressed
and
silent
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
took
her
place
in
the
line
went
forward
with
the
others
and
was
admitted
they
searched
her
she
inquired
for
salle
and
was
directed
to
the
second
wing
on
the
second
floor
she
found
the
hall
and
the
bed
no
which
was
as
she
had
been
told
one
of
the
last
at
the
right
indeed
she
was
guided
thither
as
it
were
from
the
farther
end
of
the
hall
by
germinie
smile
the
smile
of
a
sick
person
in
a
hospital
at
an
unexpected
visit
which
says
so
gently
as
soon
as
you
enter
the
room
here
i
am
she
leaned
over
the
bed
germinie
tried
to
push
her
away
with
a
gesture
of
humility
and
the
shamefacedness
of
a
servant
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
kissed
her
ah
said
germinie
the
time
dragged
terribly
yesterday
i
imagined
it
was
thursday
and
i
longed
so
for
you
my
poor
girl
how
are
you
oh
i
getting
on
finely
now
the
swelling
in
my
bowels
has
all
gone
i
have
only
three
weeks
to
stay
here
mademoiselle
you
see
they
talk
about
a
month
or
six
weeks
but
i
know
better
and
i
very
comfortable
here
i
do
mind
it
at
all
i
sleep
all
night
now
my
but
i
was
thirsty
when
you
brought
me
here
monday
they
would
give
me
wine
and
water
illustration
chapter
lxv
and
all
after
a
moment
conversation
leaned
over
germinie
to
kiss
her
and
with
every
kiss
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
could
hear
an
indistinct
murmur
as
of
words
exchanged
a
whispered
question
from
those
who
kissed
a
hasty
reply
from
her
who
was
what
have
you
there
to
drink
oh
what
i
had
at
home
would
you
mind
pouring
me
out
some
mademoiselle
their
pewter
things
are
so
heavy
she
raised
herself
with
one
arm
by
the
aid
of
the
little
stick
that
hung
over
the
middle
of
the
bed
and
putting
out
the
other
thin
trembling
arm
left
bare
by
the
sleeve
falling
back
from
it
she
took
the
glass
mademoiselle
held
out
to
her
and
drank
there
said
she
when
she
had
done
and
she
placed
both
her
arms
outside
the
bed
on
the
coverlid
what
a
pity
that
i
have
to
put
you
out
in
this
way
my
poor
demoiselle
she
continued
things
must
be
in
a
horribly
dirty
state
at
home
do
worry
about
that
there
was
a
moment
silence
a
faint
smile
came
to
germinie
lips
i
am
sailing
under
false
colors
she
said
lowering
her
voice
i
have
confessed
so
as
to
get
well
then
she
moved
her
head
on
the
pillow
in
order
to
bring
her
mouth
nearer
to
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
ear
there
are
tales
to
tell
here
i
have
a
funny
neighbor
yonder
she
indicated
with
a
glance
and
a
movement
of
her
shoulder
the
patient
to
whom
her
back
was
turned
there
a
man
who
comes
here
to
see
her
he
talked
to
her
an
hour
yesterday
i
heard
them
say
they
had
a
child
she
has
left
her
husband
he
was
like
a
madman
the
man
was
when
he
was
talking
to
her
as
she
spoke
germinie
face
lighted
up
as
if
she
were
still
full
of
the
scene
of
the
day
before
still
stirred
up
and
feverish
with
jealousy
so
near
death
as
she
was
because
she
had
heard
love
spoken
of
beside
her
suddenly
her
expression
changed
a
woman
came
toward
her
bed
she
seemed
embarrassed
when
she
saw
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
after
a
few
moments
she
kissed
germinie
and
hurriedly
withdrew
as
another
woman
came
up
the
did
the
same
kissed
germinie
and
at
once
took
her
leave
after
the
women
a
man
came
then
another
woman
one
and
all
after
a
moment
conversation
leaned
over
germinie
to
kiss
her
and
with
every
kiss
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
could
hear
an
indistinct
murmur
as
of
words
exchanged
a
whispered
question
from
those
who
kissed
a
hasty
reply
from
her
who
was
kissed
well
she
said
to
germinie
i
hope
you
are
well
taken
care
of
oh
yes
germinie
answered
in
a
peculiar
tone
they
take
excellent
care
of
me
she
had
lost
the
animation
that
she
displayed
at
the
beginning
of
the
visit
the
little
blood
that
had
mounted
to
her
cheeks
remained
there
in
one
spot
only
her
face
seemed
closed
it
was
cold
and
deaf
like
a
wall
her
lips
were
sealed
as
it
were
her
features
were
concealed
beneath
the
veil
of
infinite
dumb
agony
there
was
nothing
caressing
or
eloquent
in
her
staring
eyes
absorbed
as
they
were
and
filled
with
one
fixed
thought
you
would
have
said
that
all
exterior
signs
of
her
ideas
were
drawn
within
her
by
an
irresistible
power
of
concentration
by
a
last
supreme
effort
of
her
will
and
that
her
whole
being
was
clinging
in
desperation
to
a
sorrow
that
drew
everything
to
itself
the
visitors
she
had
just
received
were
the
grocer
the
the
butter
woman
and
the
laundress
all
her
debts
incarnate
the
kisses
were
the
kisses
of
her
creditors
who
came
to
keep
on
the
scent
of
their
claims
and
to
extort
money
from
her
lxvi
mademoiselle
had
just
risen
on
saturday
morning
she
was
making
a
little
package
of
four
jars
of
bar
preserves
which
she
intended
to
carry
to
germinie
the
next
day
when
she
heard
low
voices
a
colloquy
between
the
housekeeper
and
the
concierge
in
the
reception
room
almost
immediately
the
door
opened
and
the
concierge
came
in
sad
news
mademoiselle
he
said
and
he
handed
her
a
letter
he
had
in
his
hand
it
bore
the
stamp
of
the
lariboisière
hospital
germinie
was
dead
she
died
at
seven
that
morning
mademoiselle
took
the
letter
she
saw
only
the
letters
that
said
dead
dead
and
they
repeated
the
word
dead
dead
to
no
purpose
for
she
could
not
believe
it
as
is
always
the
case
with
a
person
of
whose
death
one
learns
abruptly
germinie
appeared
to
her
instinct
with
life
and
her
body
which
was
no
more
seemed
to
stand
before
her
with
the
presence
of
a
ghost
dead
she
should
never
see
her
more
so
there
was
no
longer
a
germinie
on
earth
dead
she
was
dead
and
the
person
she
should
hear
henceforth
moving
about
in
the
kitchen
would
not
be
she
somebody
else
would
open
the
door
for
her
somebody
else
would
potter
about
her
room
in
the
morning
germinie
she
cried
at
last
in
the
tone
with
which
she
was
accustomed
to
call
her
then
collecting
her
thoughts
machine
creature
what
your
name
she
cried
savagely
to
the
bewildered
housekeeper
my
dress
i
must
go
there
she
was
so
taken
by
surprise
by
this
sudden
fatal
termination
of
the
disease
that
she
could
not
accustom
her
mind
to
the
thought
she
could
hardly
realize
that
sudden
secret
vague
death
of
which
her
only
knowledge
was
derived
from
a
scrap
of
paper
was
germinie
really
dead
mademoiselle
asked
herself
the
question
with
the
doubt
of
persons
who
have
lost
a
dear
one
far
away
and
not
having
seen
her
die
do
not
admit
that
she
is
dead
was
she
not
still
alive
the
last
time
she
saw
her
how
could
it
have
happened
how
could
she
so
suddenly
have
become
a
thing
good
for
nothing
except
to
be
put
under
ground
mademoiselle
dared
not
think
about
it
and
yet
she
kept
on
thinking
the
mystery
of
the
of
which
she
knew
nothing
attracted
and
terrified
her
the
anxious
interest
of
her
affection
turned
to
her
maid
last
hours
and
she
tried
gropingly
to
take
away
the
veil
and
repel
the
feeling
of
horror
then
she
was
seized
with
an
irresistible
longing
to
know
everything
to
witness
with
the
help
of
what
might
be
told
her
what
she
had
not
seen
she
felt
that
she
must
know
if
germinie
had
spoken
before
she
died
if
she
had
expressed
any
desire
spoken
of
any
last
wishes
uttered
one
of
those
sentences
which
are
the
final
outcry
of
life
when
she
reached
lariboisière
she
passed
the
concierge
a
stout
man
reeking
with
life
as
one
reeks
with
wine
passed
through
the
corridors
where
pallid
convalescents
were
gliding
hither
and
thither
and
rang
at
a
door
veiled
with
white
curtains
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
hospital
the
door
was
opened
she
found
herself
in
a
parlor
lighted
by
two
windows
where
a
plaster
cast
of
the
virgin
stood
upon
an
altar
between
two
views
of
vesuvius
which
seemed
to
shiver
against
the
bare
wall
behind
her
through
an
open
door
came
the
voices
of
sisters
and
little
girls
chattering
together
a
clamor
of
youthful
voices
and
fresh
laughter
the
natural
gayety
of
a
cheery
room
where
the
sun
frolics
with
children
at
play
mademoiselle
asked
to
speak
with
the
of
salle
a
short
sister
with
a
kind
homely
face
a
face
alight
with
the
grace
of
god
came
in
answer
to
her
request
germinie
had
died
in
her
arms
she
hardly
suffered
at
all
the
sister
told
mademoiselle
she
was
sure
that
she
was
better
she
felt
relieved
she
was
full
of
hope
about
seven
this
morning
just
as
her
bed
was
being
made
she
suddenly
began
vomiting
blood
and
passed
away
without
knowing
that
she
was
dying
the
sister
added
that
she
had
said
nothing
asked
for
nothing
expressed
no
wish
mademoiselle
rose
delivered
from
the
horrible
thoughts
she
had
had
germinie
had
been
spared
all
the
tortures
of
the
that
she
had
dreamed
of
mademoiselle
was
grateful
for
that
death
by
the
hand
of
god
which
gathers
in
the
soul
at
a
single
stroke
as
she
was
going
away
an
attendant
came
to
her
and
said
will
you
be
kind
enough
to
identify
the
body
body
the
words
gave
mademoiselle
a
terrible
shock
without
awaiting
her
reply
the
attendant
led
the
way
to
a
high
yellow
door
over
which
was
written
he
knocked
a
man
in
shirt
sleeves
with
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
opened
the
door
and
bade
them
wait
a
moment
mademoiselle
waited
her
thoughts
terrified
her
her
imagination
was
on
the
other
side
of
that
awful
door
she
tried
to
anticipate
what
she
was
about
to
see
and
her
mind
was
so
filled
with
confused
images
with
fanciful
alarms
that
she
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
entering
the
room
of
recognizing
that
disfigured
face
among
a
number
of
others
if
indeed
she
could
recognize
it
and
yet
she
could
not
tear
herself
away
she
said
to
herself
that
she
should
never
see
her
again
the
man
with
the
pipe
opened
the
door
mademoiselle
saw
nothing
but
a
coffin
the
lid
of
which
extended
only
to
the
neck
leaving
face
uncovered
with
the
eyes
open
and
the
hair
erect
upon
her
head
lxvii
prostrated
by
the
excitement
and
by
this
last
spectacle
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
took
to
her
bed
on
returning
home
after
she
had
given
the
concierge
the
money
for
the
purchase
of
a
burial
lot
and
for
the
burial
and
when
she
was
in
bed
the
things
she
had
seen
arose
before
her
the
horrible
dead
body
was
still
beside
her
the
ghastly
face
framed
by
the
coffin
that
face
was
engraved
upon
her
mind
beneath
her
closed
eyelids
she
saw
it
and
was
afraid
of
it
germinie
was
there
with
the
distorted
features
of
one
who
has
been
murdered
with
sunken
orbits
and
eyes
that
seemed
to
have
withdrawn
into
their
holes
she
was
there
with
her
mouth
still
distorted
by
the
vomiting
that
accompanied
her
last
breath
she
was
there
with
her
hair
her
terrible
hair
brushed
back
and
standing
erect
upon
her
head
her
hair
that
haunted
mademoiselle
more
persistently
than
all
the
rest
the
old
maid
thought
involuntarily
of
things
that
had
come
to
her
ears
when
she
was
a
child
of
superstitions
of
the
common
people
stored
away
in
the
background
of
her
memory
she
asked
herself
if
she
had
not
been
told
that
dead
people
whose
hair
is
like
that
carry
a
crime
with
them
to
the
grave
and
at
times
it
was
such
hair
as
that
that
she
saw
upon
that
head
the
hair
of
crime
standing
on
end
with
terror
and
stiffened
with
horror
before
the
justice
of
heaven
like
the
hair
of
the
condemned
man
before
the
scaffold
in
la
grève
on
sunday
mademoiselle
was
too
ill
to
leave
her
bed
on
monday
she
tried
to
rise
and
dress
in
order
to
attend
the
funeral
but
she
was
attacked
with
faintness
and
was
obliged
to
return
to
her
bed
lxviii
well
is
it
all
over
said
mademoiselle
from
her
bed
as
the
concierge
entered
her
room
about
eleven
on
his
return
from
the
cemetery
with
the
black
coat
and
the
sanctimonious
manner
suited
to
the
occasion
yes
mademoiselle
thank
god
the
poor
girl
is
out
of
pain
stay
i
have
no
head
put
the
receipts
and
the
rest
of
the
money
on
my
table
we
will
settle
our
accounts
some
other
day
the
concierge
stood
before
her
without
moving
or
evincing
any
purpose
to
go
shifting
from
one
hand
to
the
other
a
blue
velvet
cap
made
from
the
dress
of
one
of
his
daughters
after
a
moment
reflection
he
decided
to
speak
this
burying
is
an
expensive
business
mademoiselle
in
the
first
place
there
who
asked
you
to
give
the
figures
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
interrupted
with
the
haughty
air
of
superb
charity
the
concierge
continued
and
as
i
was
saying
a
lot
in
the
cemetery
which
you
told
me
to
get
ai
given
away
it
no
use
for
you
to
have
a
kind
heart
mademoiselle
you
ai
any
too
rich
everyone
knows
that
and
i
says
to
myself
going
to
have
no
small
amount
to
pay
out
and
i
know
mademoiselle
she
pay
so
it
do
no
harm
to
economize
on
that
eh
it
be
just
so
much
saved
the
be
just
as
safe
under
ground
and
then
what
will
give
her
the
most
pleasure
up
yonder
why
to
know
that
she
is
making
things
hard
for
anybody
the
excellent
girl
pay
what
said
mademoiselle
out
of
patience
with
the
circumlocution
oh
that
of
no
account
he
replied
she
was
very
fond
of
you
all
the
same
and
then
when
she
was
very
sick
it
was
the
time
oh
you
need
put
yourself
out
there
no
hurry
about
it
money
she
owed
a
long
while
see
this
is
it
he
took
a
stamped
paper
from
the
inside
pocket
of
his
coat
i
did
want
her
to
make
a
note
she
insisted
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
seized
the
stamped
paper
and
saw
at
the
foot
i
acknowledge
the
receipt
of
the
above
germinie
lacerteux
it
was
a
promise
to
pay
three
hundred
francs
in
monthly
installments
which
were
to
be
endorsed
on
the
back
there
nothing
there
you
see
said
the
concierge
turning
the
paper
over
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
took
off
her
spectacles
i
will
pay
she
said
the
concierge
bowed
she
glanced
at
him
he
did
not
move
that
is
all
i
hope
she
said
sharply
the
concierge
had
his
eyes
fixed
on
a
leaf
in
the
carpet
all
unless
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
had
the
same
feeling
of
terror
as
at
the
moment
she
passed
through
the
door
on
whose
other
side
she
was
to
see
her
maid
dead
body
but
how
does
she
owe
all
this
she
cried
i
paid
her
good
wages
i
almost
clothed
her
where
did
her
money
go
eh
ah
there
you
are
mademoiselle
i
should
rather
not
have
told
you
but
as
well
as
and
then
too
it
better
that
you
should
be
warned
when
you
know
beforehand
you
can
arrange
matters
there
an
account
with
the
poultry
woman
the
poor
girl
owed
a
little
everywhere
she
did
keep
things
in
very
good
shape
these
last
few
years
the
laundress
left
her
book
the
last
time
she
came
it
amounts
to
quite
a
little
i
do
know
just
how
much
it
seems
there
a
note
at
the
grocer
an
old
note
it
goes
back
years
he
bring
you
his
book
how
much
at
the
grocer
something
like
two
hundred
and
fifty
all
these
disclosures
falling
upon
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
one
after
another
extorted
exclamations
of
stupefied
surprise
from
her
resting
her
elbow
on
her
pillow
she
said
nothing
as
the
veil
was
torn
away
bit
by
bit
from
this
life
as
its
shameful
features
were
brought
to
light
one
by
one
yes
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
there
a
good
deal
of
wine
he
tells
me
i
have
always
had
wine
in
the
cellar
the
continued
the
concierge
without
heeding
her
remark
that
no
great
matter
some
francs
it
for
absinthe
and
brandy
she
drank
cried
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
everything
made
clear
to
her
by
those
words
the
concierge
did
not
seem
to
hear
you
see
mademoiselle
knowing
the
jupillons
was
the
death
of
her
the
young
man
especially
it
was
for
herself
that
she
did
what
she
did
and
the
disappointment
you
see
she
took
to
drink
she
hoped
to
marry
him
i
ought
to
say
she
fitted
up
a
room
for
him
when
they
get
to
buying
furniture
the
money
goes
fast
she
ruined
herself
think
of
it
it
was
no
use
for
me
to
tell
her
not
to
throw
herself
away
by
drinking
as
she
did
you
do
suppose
i
was
going
to
tell
you
when
she
came
in
at
six
in
the
morning
it
was
the
same
with
her
child
oh
the
concierge
added
in
reply
to
mademoiselle
gesture
it
was
a
lucky
thing
the
little
one
died
never
mind
you
can
say
she
led
a
gay
life
and
a
hard
one
that
why
i
say
the
common
ditch
if
i
was
you
she
cost
you
enough
mademoiselle
all
the
time
she
been
living
on
you
and
you
can
leave
her
where
she
is
with
everybody
else
ah
that
how
it
is
that
what
she
was
she
stole
for
men
she
ran
in
debt
ah
she
did
well
to
die
the
hussy
and
i
must
pay
a
child
think
of
that
the
slut
yes
indeed
she
can
rot
where
she
will
you
have
done
well
monsieur
henri
steal
she
stole
from
me
in
the
ditch
parbleu
that
quite
good
enough
for
her
to
think
that
i
let
her
keep
all
my
keys
i
never
kept
any
account
my
god
that
what
comes
of
confidence
well
here
we
are
i
pay
not
on
her
account
but
on
my
own
and
i
gave
her
my
best
pair
of
sheets
to
be
buried
in
ah
if
i
known
i
have
given
you
the
kitchen
how
i
am
and
mademoiselle
continued
in
this
strain
for
some
moments
until
the
words
choked
one
another
in
her
throat
and
strangled
her
lxix
as
a
result
of
this
scene
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
kept
her
bed
a
week
ill
and
raging
filled
with
indignation
that
shook
her
whole
body
overflowed
through
her
mouth
and
tore
from
her
now
and
again
some
coarse
insult
which
she
would
hurl
with
a
shriek
of
rage
at
her
vile
memory
night
and
day
she
was
possessed
by
the
same
fever
of
malediction
and
even
in
her
dreams
her
attenuated
limbs
were
convulsed
with
wrath
was
it
possible
germinie
her
germinie
she
could
think
of
nothing
else
debts
a
child
all
sorts
of
shame
the
degraded
creature
she
abhorred
her
she
detested
her
if
she
had
lived
she
would
have
denounced
her
to
the
police
she
would
have
liked
to
believe
in
hell
so
that
she
might
be
consigned
to
the
torments
that
await
the
dead
her
maid
was
such
a
creature
as
that
a
girl
who
had
been
in
her
service
twenty
years
whom
she
had
loaded
down
with
benefits
drunkenness
she
had
sunk
so
low
as
that
the
horror
that
succeeds
a
bad
dream
came
to
mademoiselle
and
all
the
waves
of
loathing
that
flowed
from
her
heart
said
out
upon
the
dead
woman
whose
life
the
grave
vomited
forth
and
whose
filth
it
cast
out
how
she
had
deceived
her
how
the
wretch
had
pretended
to
love
her
and
to
make
her
appear
more
ungrateful
and
more
despicable
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
recalled
her
manifestations
of
affection
her
attentions
her
jealousies
which
seemed
a
part
of
her
adoration
she
saw
her
bending
over
her
when
she
was
she
thought
of
her
caresses
it
was
all
a
lie
her
devotion
was
a
lie
the
delight
with
which
she
kissed
her
the
love
upon
her
lips
were
lies
mademoiselle
told
herself
over
and
over
again
she
persuaded
herself
that
it
was
so
and
yet
little
by
little
from
these
reminiscences
from
these
evocations
of
the
past
whose
bitterness
she
sought
to
make
more
bitter
from
the
sweetness
of
days
gone
by
there
arose
within
her
a
first
sensation
of
pity
she
drove
away
the
thoughts
that
tended
to
allay
her
wrath
but
reflection
brought
them
back
thereupon
there
came
to
her
mind
some
things
to
which
she
had
paid
no
heed
during
germinie
lifetime
trifles
of
which
the
grave
makes
us
take
thought
and
upon
which
death
sheds
light
she
had
a
vague
remembrance
of
certain
strange
performances
on
the
part
of
her
maid
of
feverish
effusions
and
frantic
embraces
of
her
throwing
herself
on
her
knees
as
if
she
were
about
to
make
a
confession
of
movements
of
the
lips
as
if
a
secret
were
trembling
on
their
verge
she
saw
with
the
eyes
we
have
for
those
who
are
no
more
wistful
glances
her
gestures
and
attitudes
the
despairing
expression
of
her
face
and
now
she
realized
that
there
were
deep
wounds
beneath
pain
the
torment
of
her
anguish
and
her
repentance
the
tears
of
blood
of
her
remorse
all
sorts
of
suffering
forced
out
of
sight
throughout
her
life
and
in
her
whole
being
a
passion
of
shame
that
dared
not
ask
forgiveness
except
with
silence
then
she
would
scold
herself
for
the
thought
and
call
herself
an
old
fool
her
instinct
of
rigid
uprightness
the
stern
conscience
and
harsh
judgment
of
a
stainless
life
the
things
which
cause
a
virtuous
woman
to
condemn
a
harlot
and
should
have
caused
a
saint
like
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
to
be
without
pity
for
her
servant
everything
within
her
rebelled
against
a
pardon
the
voice
of
justice
stifling
her
kindness
of
heart
cried
never
never
and
she
would
expel
germinie
infamous
phantom
with
a
pitiless
gesture
there
were
times
indeed
when
in
order
to
make
her
condemnation
and
execration
of
her
memory
more
irrevocable
she
would
heap
charges
upon
her
and
slander
her
she
would
add
to
the
dead
woman
horrible
list
of
sins
she
would
reproach
germinie
for
more
than
was
justly
chargeable
to
her
she
would
attribute
crimes
to
her
dark
thoughts
murderous
desires
to
her
impatient
dreams
she
would
strive
to
think
she
would
force
herself
to
think
that
she
had
desired
her
mistress
death
and
had
been
awaiting
it
but
at
that
very
moment
amid
the
blackest
of
her
thoughts
and
suppositions
a
vision
arose
and
stood
in
a
bright
light
before
her
a
figure
approached
that
seemed
to
come
to
meet
her
glance
a
figure
against
which
she
could
not
defend
herself
and
which
passed
through
the
hands
with
which
she
sought
to
force
it
back
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
saw
her
dead
maid
once
more
she
saw
once
more
the
face
of
which
she
had
caught
a
glimpse
in
the
amphitheatre
the
crucified
face
the
tortured
face
to
which
the
blood
and
agony
of
a
heart
had
mounted
together
she
saw
it
once
more
with
the
faculty
which
the
second
sight
of
memory
separates
from
its
surroundings
and
that
face
as
it
became
clearer
to
her
caused
her
less
terror
it
appeared
to
her
divesting
itself
as
it
were
of
its
horrifying
qualities
suffering
alone
remained
but
it
was
the
suffering
of
expiation
almost
of
prayer
the
suffering
of
a
dead
face
that
would
like
to
weep
and
as
its
expression
grew
ever
milder
mademoiselle
came
at
last
to
see
in
it
a
glance
of
supplication
of
supplication
that
at
last
compelled
her
pity
insensibly
there
glided
into
her
reflections
indulgent
thoughts
suggestions
of
apology
that
surprised
herself
she
asked
herself
if
the
poor
girl
was
as
guilty
as
others
if
she
had
deliberately
chosen
the
path
of
evil
if
life
circumstances
the
misfortune
of
her
body
and
her
destiny
had
not
made
her
the
creature
she
had
been
a
creature
of
love
and
sorrow
suddenly
she
stopped
she
was
on
the
point
of
forgiving
her
one
morning
she
leaped
out
of
bed
here
you
you
other
she
cried
to
her
housekeeper
the
devil
take
your
name
i
ca
remember
it
give
me
my
clothes
quick
i
have
to
go
out
the
idea
mademoiselle
just
look
at
the
roofs
they
all
white
well
it
snows
that
all
ten
minutes
later
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
said
to
the
driver
of
the
cab
she
had
sent
for
montmartre
cemetery
lxx
in
the
distance
an
enclosure
wall
extended
perfectly
straight
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
the
thread
of
snow
that
marked
the
outline
of
its
coping
gave
it
a
dirty
rusty
color
in
a
corner
at
the
left
three
leafless
trees
reared
their
bare
black
branches
against
the
sky
they
rustled
sadly
with
the
sound
of
pieces
of
dead
wood
stirred
by
the
south
wind
above
these
trees
behind
the
wall
and
close
against
it
arose
the
two
arms
from
which
hung
one
of
the
last
in
paris
a
few
roofs
were
scattered
here
and
there
beyond
the
hill
of
montmartre
rose
sharply
its
white
shroud
broken
by
oases
of
brown
earth
and
sandy
patches
low
gray
walls
followed
the
slope
surmounted
by
gaunt
stunted
trees
whose
branches
had
a
bluish
tint
in
the
mist
as
far
as
two
black
windmills
the
sky
was
of
a
leaden
hue
with
occasional
cold
bluish
streaks
as
if
ink
had
been
applied
with
a
brush
over
montmartre
there
was
a
light
streak
of
a
yellow
color
like
the
seine
water
after
heavy
rains
above
that
wintry
beam
the
wings
of
an
invisible
windmill
turned
and
turned
wings
unvarying
in
their
movement
which
seemed
to
be
turning
for
eternity
in
front
of
the
wall
against
which
was
planted
a
thicket
of
dead
cypresses
turned
red
by
the
frost
was
a
vast
tract
of
land
upon
which
were
two
rows
of
crowded
jostling
overturned
crosses
like
two
great
funeral
processions
the
crosses
touched
and
pushed
one
another
and
trod
on
one
another
heels
they
bent
and
fell
and
collapsed
in
the
ranks
in
the
middle
there
was
a
sort
of
congestion
which
had
caused
them
to
bulge
out
on
both
sides
you
could
see
them
lying
covered
by
the
snow
and
raising
it
into
mounds
with
the
thick
wood
of
which
they
were
made
upon
the
paths
somewhat
trampled
in
the
centre
that
skirted
the
two
long
files
the
broken
ranks
undulated
with
the
fluctuation
of
a
multitude
the
disorder
and
wavering
course
of
a
long
march
the
black
crosses
with
their
arms
outstretched
assumed
the
appearance
of
ghosts
and
persons
in
distress
the
two
disorderly
columns
made
one
think
of
a
human
panic
a
desperate
frightened
army
it
was
as
if
one
were
looking
on
at
a
terrible
rout
all
the
crosses
were
laden
with
wreaths
wreaths
of
immortelles
wreaths
of
white
paper
with
silver
thread
black
wreaths
with
gold
thread
but
you
could
see
them
beneath
the
snow
worn
out
withered
ghastly
things
souvenirs
as
it
were
which
the
other
dead
would
not
accept
and
which
had
been
picked
up
in
order
to
make
a
little
toilet
for
the
crosses
with
gleanings
from
the
graves
all
the
crosses
had
a
name
written
in
white
but
there
were
other
names
that
were
not
even
written
on
a
piece
of
wood
a
broken
branch
of
a
tree
stuck
in
the
ground
with
an
envelope
tied
around
it
such
tombstones
as
that
were
to
be
seen
there
on
the
left
where
they
were
digging
a
trench
for
a
third
row
of
crosses
the
workman
shovel
threw
black
dirt
into
the
air
which
fell
upon
the
white
earth
around
profound
silence
the
deaf
silence
of
the
snow
enveloped
everything
and
but
two
sounds
could
be
heard
the
dull
sound
made
by
the
clods
of
earth
and
the
heavy
sound
of
regular
footsteps
an
old
priest
who
was
waiting
there
his
head
enveloped
in
a
black
cowl
dressed
in
a
black
gown
and
stole
and
with
a
dirty
yellow
surplice
was
trying
to
keep
himself
warm
by
stamping
his
great
galoches
on
the
pavement
of
the
high
road
in
front
of
the
crosses
such
was
the
common
ditch
in
those
days
that
tract
of
land
those
crosses
and
that
priest
said
this
here
sleeps
the
death
of
the
common
people
this
is
the
poor
man
end
o
paris
thou
art
the
heart
of
the
world
thou
art
the
great
city
of
humanity
the
great
city
of
charity
and
brotherly
love
thou
hast
kindly
intentions
habits
of
compassion
theatres
that
give
alms
the
poor
man
is
thy
citizen
as
well
as
the
rich
man
thy
churches
speak
of
jesus
christ
thy
laws
speak
of
equality
thy
newspapers
speak
of
progress
all
thy
governments
speak
of
the
common
people
and
this
is
where
thou
castest
those
who
die
in
thy
service
those
who
kill
themselves
ministering
to
thy
luxury
those
who
perish
in
the
noisome
odors
of
thy
factories
those
who
have
sweated
their
lives
away
working
for
thee
giving
thee
thy
prosperity
thy
pleasures
thy
splendors
those
who
have
furnished
thy
animation
and
thy
noise
those
who
have
lengthened
with
the
links
of
their
lives
the
chain
of
thy
duration
as
a
capital
those
who
have
been
the
crowd
in
thy
streets
and
the
common
people
of
thy
grandeur
each
of
thy
cemeteries
has
a
like
shameful
corner
hidden
in
the
angle
of
a
wall
where
thou
makest
haste
to
bury
them
and
where
thou
castest
dirt
upon
them
in
such
stingy
clods
that
one
can
see
the
ends
of
their
coffins
protruding
one
would
say
that
thy
charity
stops
with
their
last
breath
that
thy
only
free
gift
is
the
bed
whereon
they
suffer
and
that
when
the
hospital
can
do
no
more
for
them
thou
who
art
so
vast
and
so
superb
hast
no
place
for
them
thou
dost
heap
them
up
crowd
them
together
and
mingle
them
in
death
as
thou
didst
mingle
them
in
the
beneath
the
sheets
of
thy
hospitals
a
hundred
years
since
as
late
as
yesterday
thou
hadst
only
that
priest
on
sentry
duty
to
throw
a
drop
of
paltry
holy
water
on
every
comer
not
the
briefest
prayer
even
that
symbol
of
decency
was
lacking
god
could
not
be
disturbed
for
so
small
a
matter
and
what
the
priest
blesses
is
always
the
same
thing
a
trench
in
which
the
pine
boxes
strike
against
one
another
where
the
dead
enjoy
no
privacy
corruption
there
is
common
to
all
no
one
has
his
own
but
each
one
has
that
of
all
the
rest
the
worms
are
owned
promiscuously
in
the
devouring
soil
a
montfaucon
hastens
to
make
way
for
the
catacombs
for
the
dead
here
have
no
more
time
than
room
to
rot
in
the
earth
is
taken
from
them
before
it
has
finished
with
them
before
their
bones
have
assumed
the
color
and
the
ancient
appearance
so
to
speak
of
stone
before
the
passing
years
have
effaced
the
last
trace
of
humanity
and
the
memory
of
a
body
the
excavation
is
renewed
when
the
earth
is
still
themselves
when
they
are
the
damp
soil
in
which
the
mattock
is
buried
the
earth
is
loaned
to
them
you
say
but
it
does
not
even
confine
the
odor
of
death
in
summer
the
wind
that
passes
over
this
human
wafts
the
unholy
miasma
to
the
city
of
the
living
in
the
scorching
days
of
august
the
keepers
deny
admission
to
the
place
there
are
flies
that
bear
upon
them
the
poison
of
the
carrion
pestilential
flies
whose
sting
is
deadly
mademoiselle
arrived
at
this
spot
after
passing
the
wall
that
separates
the
lots
sold
in
perpetuity
from
those
sold
temporarily
only
following
the
directions
given
her
by
a
keeper
she
walked
along
between
the
further
line
of
crosses
and
the
trench
and
there
she
made
her
way
over
buried
wreaths
over
the
snowy
pall
to
a
hole
where
the
trench
began
it
was
covered
over
with
old
rotten
planks
and
a
sheet
of
oxidized
zinc
on
which
a
workman
had
thrown
his
blue
blouse
the
earth
sloped
away
behind
them
to
the
bottom
of
the
trench
where
could
be
seen
the
sinister
outlines
of
three
wooden
coffins
there
were
one
large
one
and
two
smaller
ones
just
behind
the
crosses
of
the
past
week
of
the
day
before
of
two
days
before
extended
in
a
line
down
the
slope
they
glided
along
plunged
suddenly
downward
and
seemed
to
be
taking
long
strides
as
if
they
were
in
danger
of
being
carried
over
a
precipice
mademoiselle
began
to
ascend
the
path
by
these
crosses
spelling
out
the
dates
and
searching
for
the
names
with
her
wretched
eyes
she
reached
the
crosses
of
the
of
november
that
was
the
day
before
her
death
and
germinie
should
be
close
by
there
were
five
crosses
of
the
of
november
five
crosses
huddled
close
together
germinie
was
not
in
the
crush
mademoiselle
de
varandeuil
went
a
little
farther
on
to
the
crosses
of
the
then
to
those
of
the
then
to
those
of
the
she
returned
to
the
and
looked
carefully
around
in
all
directions
there
was
nothing
absolutely
nothing
germinie
had
been
buried
without
a
cross
not
even
a
bit
of
wood
had
been
placed
in
the
ground
by
which
to
identify
her
grave
at
last
the
old
lady
dropped
on
her
knees
in
the
snow
between
two
crosses
one
of
which
bore
the
date
of
the
and
the
other
of
the
of
november
all
that
remained
of
germinie
should
be
almost
in
that
spot
that
space
was
her
grave
to
pray
over
her
body
it
was
necessary
to
pray
at
random
between
two
dates
as
if
the
poor
girl
destiny
had
decreed
that
there
should
be
no
more
room
on

for
her
body
than
for
her
