hale
peterkin
puts
salt
into
her
coffee
dedicated
to
meggie
the
daughter
of
the
lady
from
philadelphia
to
whom
these
stories
were
first
told
preface
to
the
second
edition
of
the
peterkin
papers
the
first
of
these
stories
was
accepted
by
howard
ticknor
for
the
young
they
were
afterwards
continued
in
numbers
of
the
st
a
second
edition
is
now
printed
containing
a
new
paper
which
has
never
before
been
published
the
peterkins
at
the
it
may
be
remembered
that
the
peterkins
originally
hesitated
about
publishing
their
family
papers
and
were
decided
by
referring
the
matter
to
the
lady
from
philadelphia
a
little
uncertain
of
whether
she
might
happen
to
be
at
philadelphia
they
determined
to
write
and
ask
her
solomon
john
suggested
a
everybody
reads
a
postal
and
everybody
would
read
it
as
it
came
along
and
see
its
importance
and
help
it
on
if
the
lady
from
philadelphia
were
away
her
family
and
all
her
servants
would
read
it
and
send
it
after
her
for
answer
elizabeth
eliza
thought
the
postal
a
bright
idea
it
would
not
take
so
long
to
write
as
a
letter
and
would
not
be
so
expensive
but
could
they
get
the
whole
subject
on
a
postal
peterkin
believed
there
could
be
no
difficulty
there
was
but
one
question
shall
the
adventures
of
the
peterkin
family
be
published
this
was
decided
upon
and
there
was
room
for
each
of
the
family
to
sign
the
little
boys
contenting
themselves
with
rough
sketches
of
their
boots
peterkin
agamemnon
and
solomon
john
took
the
to
the
early
one
morning
and
by
the
afternoon
of
that
very
day
and
all
the
next
day
and
for
many
days
came
streaming
in
answers
on
postals
and
on
letters
their
card
had
been
addressed
to
the
lady
from
philadelphia
with
the
number
of
her
street
but
it
must
have
been
read
by
their
neighbors
in
their
own
town
before
leaving
it
must
have
been
read
along
its
way
for
by
each
mail
came
piles
of
postals
and
letters
from
town
after
town
in
answer
to
the
question
and
all
in
the
same
tone
yes
yes
publish
the
adventures
of
the
peterkin
publish
them
of
and
in
time
came
the
answer
of
the
lady
from
philadelphia
yes
of
course
publish
this
is
why
they
were
published
the
lady
who
put
salt
in
her
coffee
this
was
peterkin
it
was
a
mistake
she
had
poured
out
a
delicious
cup
of
coffee
and
just
as
she
was
helping
herself
to
cream
she
found
she
had
put
in
salt
instead
of
sugar
it
tasted
bad
what
should
she
do
of
course
she
couldn
t
drink
the
coffee
so
she
called
in
the
family
for
she
was
sitting
at
a
late
breakfast
all
alone
the
family
came
in
they
all
tasted
and
looked
and
wondered
what
should
be
done
and
all
sat
down
to
think
at
last
agamemnon
who
had
been
to
college
said
why
don
t
we
go
over
and
ask
the
advice
of
the
chemist
for
the
chemist
lived
over
the
way
and
was
a
very
wise
man
peterkin
said
yes
and
peterkin
said
very
well
and
all
the
children
said
they
would
go
too
so
the
little
boys
put
on
their
boots
and
over
they
went
now
the
chemist
was
just
trying
to
find
out
something
which
should
turn
everything
it
touched
into
gold
and
he
had
a
large
glass
bottle
into
which
he
put
all
kinds
of
gold
and
silver
and
many
other
valuable
things
and
melted
them
all
up
over
the
fire
till
he
had
almost
found
what
he
wanted
he
could
turn
things
into
almost
gold
but
just
now
he
had
used
up
all
the
gold
that
he
had
round
the
house
and
gold
was
high
he
had
used
up
his
wife
s
gold
thimble
and
his
s
spectacles
and
he
had
melted
up
the
gold
head
of
his
s
cane
and
just
as
the
peterkin
family
came
in
he
was
down
on
his
knees
before
his
wife
asking
her
to
let
him
have
her
to
melt
up
with
an
the
rest
because
this
time
he
knew
he
should
succeed
and
should
be
able
to
turn
everything
into
gold
and
then
she
could
have
a
new
of
diamonds
all
set
in
emeralds
and
rubies
and
topazes
and
all
the
furniture
could
be
turned
into
the
finest
of
gold
now
his
wife
was
just
consenting
when
the
peterkin
family
burst
in
you
can
imagine
how
mad
the
chemist
was
he
came
near
throwing
his
crucible
that
was
the
name
of
his
at
their
heads
but
he
didn
t
he
listened
as
calmly
as
he
could
to
the
story
of
how
peterkin
had
put
salt
in
her
coffee
at
first
he
said
he
couldn
t
do
anything
about
it
but
when
agamemnon
said
they
would
pay
in
gold
if
he
would
only
go
he
packed
up
his
bottles
in
a
leather
case
and
went
back
with
them
all
first
he
looked
at
the
coffee
and
then
stirred
it
then
he
put
in
a
little
chlorate
of
potassium
and
the
family
tried
it
all
round
but
it
tasted
no
better
then
he
stirred
in
a
little
bichlorate
of
magnesia
but
peterkin
didn
t
like
that
then
he
added
some
tartaric
acid
and
some
hypersulphate
of
lime
but
no
it
was
no
better
i
have
it
exclaimed
the
chemist
a
little
ammonia
is
just
the
thing
no
it
wasn
t
the
thing
at
all
then
he
tried
each
in
turn
some
oxalic
cyanic
acetic
phosphoric
chloric
hyperchloric
sulphuric
boracic
silicic
nitric
formic
nitrous
nitric
and
carbonic
acids
peterkin
tasted
each
and
said
the
flavor
was
pleasant
but
not
precisely
that
of
coffee
so
then
he
tried
a
little
calcium
aluminum
barium
and
strontium
a
little
clear
bitumen
and
a
half
of
a
third
of
a
sixteenth
of
a
grain
of
arsenic
this
gave
rather
a
pretty
color
but
still
peterkin
ungratefully
said
it
tasted
of
anything
but
coffee
the
chemist
was
not
discouraged
he
put
in
a
little
belladonna
and
atropine
some
granulated
hydrogen
some
potash
and
a
very
little
antimony
finishing
off
with
a
little
pure
carbon
but
still
peterkin
was
not
satisfied
the
chemist
said
that
all
he
had
done
ought
to
have
taken
out
the
salt
the
theory
remained
the
same
although
the
experiment
had
failed
perhaps
a
little
starch
would
have
some
effect
if
not
that
was
all
the
time
he
could
give
he
should
like
to
be
paid
and
go
they
were
all
much
obliged
to
him
and
willing
to
give
him
in
gold
gold
was
now
so
peterkin
found
in
the
newspaper
this
gave
agamemnon
a
pretty
little
sum
he
sat
himself
down
to
do
it
but
there
was
the
coffee
all
sat
and
thought
awhile
till
elizabeth
eliza
said
why
don
t
we
go
to
the
elizabeth
eliza
was
the
only
daughter
she
was
named
after
her
two
aunts
elizabeth
from
the
sister
of
her
father
eliza
from
her
mother
s
sister
now
the
was
an
old
woman
who
came
round
to
sell
herbs
and
knew
a
great
deal
they
all
shouted
with
joy
at
the
idea
of
asking
her
and
solomon
john
and
the
younger
children
agreed
to
go
and
find
her
too
the
lived
down
at
the
very
end
of
the
street
so
the
boys
put
on
their
boots
again
and
they
set
off
it
was
a
long
walk
through
the
village
but
they
came
at
last
to
the
s
house
at
the
foot
of
a
high
hill
they
went
through
her
little
garden
here
she
had
marigolds
and
hollyhocks
and
old
maids
and
tall
sunflowers
and
all
kinds
of
herbs
so
that
the
air
was
full
of
and
over
the
porch
grew
a
and
a
tree
shaded
the
door
and
a
luxuriant
flung
its
delicious
fruit
across
the
window
they
went
into
a
small
parlor
which
smelt
very
spicy
all
around
hung
little
bags
full
of
catnip
and
peppermint
and
all
kinds
of
herbs
and
dried
stalks
hung
from
the
ceiling
and
on
the
shelves
were
jars
of
rhubarb
senna
manna
and
the
like
but
there
was
no
little
old
woman
she
had
gone
up
into
the
woods
to
get
some
more
wild
herbs
so
they
all
thought
they
would
follow
her
elizabeth
eliza
solomon
john
and
the
little
boys
they
had
to
climb
up
over
high
rocks
and
in
among
and
black
but
the
little
boys
had
their
boots
at
last
they
discovered
the
little
old
woman
they
knew
her
by
her
hat
it
was
without
any
vane
they
saw
her
digging
with
her
trowel
round
a
sassafras
bush
they
told
her
their
story
their
mother
had
put
salt
in
her
coffee
and
how
the
chemist
had
made
it
worse
instead
of
better
and
how
their
mother
couldn
t
drink
it
and
wouldn
t
she
come
and
see
what
she
could
do
and
she
said
she
would
and
took
up
her
little
old
apron
with
pockets
all
round
all
filled
with
everlasting
and
pennyroyal
and
went
back
to
her
house
there
she
stopped
and
stuffed
her
huge
pockets
with
some
of
all
the
kinds
of
herbs
she
took
some
tansy
and
peppermint
and
and
dill
spearmint
and
cloves
pennyroyal
and
sweet
marjoram
basil
and
rosemary
wild
thyme
and
some
of
the
other
time
as
you
have
in
clocks
sappermint
and
oppermint
catnip
valerian
and
hop
indeed
there
isn
t
a
kind
of
herb
you
can
think
of
that
the
little
old
woman
didn
t
have
done
up
in
her
little
paper
bags
that
had
all
been
dried
in
her
little
she
packed
these
all
up
and
then
went
back
with
the
children
taking
her
stick
meanwhile
peterkin
was
getting
quite
impatient
for
her
coffee
as
soon
as
the
little
old
woman
came
she
had
it
set
over
the
fire
and
began
to
stir
in
the
different
herbs
first
she
put
in
a
little
hop
for
the
bitter
peterkin
said
it
tasted
like
and
not
at
all
like
coffee
then
she
tried
a
little
flagroot
and
snakeroot
then
some
spruce
gum
and
some
caraway
and
some
dill
some
rue
and
rosemary
some
sweet
marjoram
and
sour
some
oppermint
and
sappermint
a
little
spearmint
and
peppermint
some
wild
thyme
and
some
of
the
other
tame
time
some
tansy
and
basil
and
catnip
and
valerian
and
sassafras
ginger
and
pennyroyal
the
children
tasted
after
each
mixture
but
made
up
dreadful
faces
peterkin
tasted
and
did
the
same
the
more
the
old
woman
stirred
and
the
more
she
put
in
the
worse
it
all
seemed
to
taste
so
the
old
woman
shook
her
head
and
muttered
a
few
words
and
said
she
must
go
she
believed
the
coffee
was
bewitched
she
bundled
up
her
packets
of
herbs
and
took
her
trowel
and
her
basket
and
her
stick
and
went
back
to
her
root
of
sassafras
that
she
had
left
half
in
the
air
and
half
out
and
all
she
would
take
for
pay
was
five
cents
in
currency
then
the
family
were
in
despair
and
all
sat
and
thought
a
great
while
it
was
growing
late
in
the
day
and
peterkin
hadn
t
had
her
cup
of
coffee
at
last
elizabeth
eliza
said
they
say
that
the
lady
from
philadelphia
who
is
staying
in
town
is
very
wise
suppose
i
go
and
ask
her
what
is
best
to
be
to
this
they
all
agreed
it
was
a
great
thought
and
off
elizabeth
eliza
went
she
told
the
lady
from
philadelphia
the
whole
story
how
her
mother
had
put
salt
in
the
coffee
how
the
chemist
had
been
called
in
how
he
tried
everything
but
could
make
it
no
better
and
how
they
went
for
the
little
old
and
how
she
had
tried
in
vain
for
her
mother
couldn
t
drink
the
coffee
the
lady
from
philadelphia
listened
very
attentively
and
then
said
why
doesn
t
your
mother
make
a
fresh
cup
of
coffee
elizabeth
eliza
started
with
surprise
solomon
john
shouted
with
joy
so
did
agamemnon
who
had
just
finished
his
sum
so
did
the
little
boys
who
had
followed
on
why
didn
t
we
think
of
that
said
elizabeth
eliza
and
they
all
went
back
to
their
mother
and
she
had
her
cup
of
coffee
about
elizabeth
eliza
s
piano
elizabeth
eliza
had
a
present
of
a
piano
and
she
was
to
take
lessons
of
the
postmaster
s
daughter
they
decided
to
have
the
piano
set
across
the
window
in
the
parlor
and
the
carters
brought
it
in
and
went
away
after
they
had
gone
the
family
all
came
in
to
look
at
the
piano
but
they
found
the
carters
had
placed
it
with
its
back
turned
towards
the
middle
of
the
room
standing
close
against
the
window
how
could
elizabeth
eliza
open
it
how
could
she
reach
the
keys
to
play
upon
it
solomon
john
proposed
that
they
should
open
the
window
which
agamemnon
could
do
with
his
long
arms
then
elizabeth
eliza
should
go
round
upon
the
piazza
and
open
the
piano
then
she
could
have
her
on
the
piazza
and
play
upon
the
piano
there
so
they
tried
this
and
they
all
thought
it
was
a
very
pretty
sight
to
see
elizabeth
eliza
playing
on
the
piano
while
she
sat
on
the
piazza
with
the
honeysuckle
vines
behind
her
it
was
very
pleasant
too
moonlight
evenings
peterkin
liked
to
take
a
doze
on
his
sofa
in
the
room
but
the
rest
of
the
family
liked
to
sit
on
the
piazza
so
did
elizabeth
eliza
only
she
had
to
have
her
back
to
the
moon
all
this
did
very
well
through
the
summer
but
when
the
fall
came
peterkin
thought
the
air
was
too
cold
from
the
open
window
and
the
family
did
not
want
to
sit
out
on
the
piazza
elizabeth
eliza
practiced
in
the
mornings
with
her
cloak
on
but
she
was
obliged
to
give
up
her
music
in
the
evenings
the
family
shivered
so
one
day
when
she
was
talking
with
the
lady
from
philadelphia
she
spoke
of
this
trouble
the
lady
from
philadelphia
looked
surprised
and
then
said
but
why
don
t
you
turn
the
piano
round
one
of
the
little
boys
pertly
said
it
is
a
square
but
elizabeth
eliza
went
home
directly
and
with
the
help
of
agamemnon
and
solomon
john
turned
the
piano
round
why
did
we
not
think
of
that
before
said
peterkin
what
shall
we
do
when
the
lady
from
philadelphia
goes
home
again
the
peterkins
try
to
become
wise
they
were
sitting
round
the
and
wondering
what
they
should
do
because
the
lady
from
philadelphia
had
gone
away
if
said
peterkin
we
could
only
be
more
wise
as
a
family
how
could
they
manage
it
agamemnon
had
been
to
college
and
the
children
all
went
to
school
but
still
as
a
family
they
were
not
wise
it
comes
from
books
said
one
of
the
family
people
who
have
a
great
many
books
are
very
then
they
counted
up
that
there
were
very
few
books
in
the
house
a
few
and
peterkin
s
were
all
that
s
the
thing
said
agamemnon
we
want
a
we
want
a
library
said
solomon
john
and
all
of
them
exclaimed
we
want
a
library
let
us
think
how
we
shall
get
one
said
peterkin
i
have
observed
that
other
people
think
a
great
deal
of
so
they
all
sat
and
thought
a
great
while
then
said
agamemnon
i
will
make
a
library
there
are
some
boards
in
the
and
i
have
a
hammer
and
some
nails
and
perhaps
we
can
borrow
some
hinges
and
there
we
have
our
library
they
were
all
very
much
pleased
at
the
idea
that
s
the
part
said
elizabeth
eliza
but
where
are
the
books
so
they
sat
and
thought
a
little
while
when
solomon
john
exclaimed
i
will
make
a
book
they
all
looked
at
him
in
wonder
yes
said
solomon
john
books
will
make
us
wise
but
first
i
must
make
a
so
they
went
into
the
parlor
and
sat
down
to
make
a
book
but
there
was
no
ink
what
should
he
do
for
ink
elizabeth
eliza
said
she
had
heard
that
nutgalls
and
vinegar
made
very
good
ink
so
they
decided
to
make
some
the
little
boys
said
they
could
find
some
nutgalls
up
in
the
woods
so
they
all
agreed
to
set
out
and
pick
some
peterkins
put
on
her
and
the
little
boys
got
into
their
boots
and
off
they
went
the
nutgalls
were
hard
to
find
there
was
almost
everything
else
in
the
woods
chestnuts
and
walnuts
and
small
and
a
great
many
squirrels
and
they
had
to
walk
a
great
way
before
they
found
any
nutgalls
at
last
they
came
home
with
a
large
basket
and
two
nutgalls
in
it
then
came
the
question
of
the
vinegar
peterkin
had
used
her
very
last
on
some
beets
they
had
the
day
before
suppose
we
go
and
ask
the
minister
s
wife
said
elizabeth
eliza
so
they
all
went
to
the
minister
s
wife
she
said
if
they
wanted
some
good
vinegar
they
had
better
set
a
barrel
of
cider
down
in
the
cellar
and
in
a
year
or
two
it
would
make
very
nice
vinegar
but
they
said
they
wanted
it
that
very
afternoon
when
the
minister
s
wife
heard
this
she
said
she
should
be
very
glad
to
let
them
have
some
vinegar
and
gave
them
a
cupful
to
carry
home
so
they
stirred
in
the
nutgalls
and
by
the
time
evening
came
they
had
very
good
ink
then
solomon
john
wanted
a
pen
agamemnon
had
a
steel
one
but
solomon
john
said
poets
always
used
elizabeth
eliza
suggested
that
they
should
go
out
to
the
and
get
a
quill
but
it
was
already
dark
they
had
however
two
lanterns
and
the
little
boys
borrowed
the
neighbors
they
set
out
in
procession
for
the
when
they
got
there
the
fowls
were
all
at
roost
so
they
could
look
at
them
quietly
solomon
john
s
book
but
there
were
no
geese
there
were
shanghais
and
and
guinea
hens
and
barbary
hens
and
speckled
hens
and
poland
roosters
and
bantams
and
ducks
and
turkeys
but
not
one
goose
no
geese
but
ourselves
said
peterkin
wittily
as
they
returned
to
the
house
the
sight
of
this
procession
roused
up
the
village
a
torchlight
procession
cried
all
the
boys
of
the
town
and
they
gathered
round
the
house
shouting
for
the
flag
and
peterkin
had
to
invite
them
in
and
give
them
cider
and
gingerbread
before
he
could
explain
to
them
that
it
was
only
his
family
visiting
his
hens
after
the
crowd
had
dispersed
solomon
john
sat
down
to
think
of
his
writing
again
agamemnon
agreed
to
go
over
to
the
bookstore
to
get
a
quill
they
all
went
over
with
him
the
bookseller
was
just
shutting
up
his
shop
however
he
agreed
to
go
in
and
get
a
quill
which
he
did
and
they
hurried
home
so
solomon
john
sat
down
again
but
there
was
no
paper
and
now
the
bookstore
was
shut
up
peterkin
suggested
that
the
mail
was
about
in
and
perhaps
he
should
have
a
letter
and
then
they
could
use
the
envelope
to
write
upon
so
they
all
went
to
the
and
the
little
boys
had
their
boots
on
and
they
all
shouted
when
they
found
peterkin
had
a
letter
the
postmaster
inquired
what
they
were
shouting
about
and
when
they
told
him
he
said
he
would
give
solomon
john
a
whole
sheet
of
paper
for
his
book
and
they
all
went
back
rejoicing
so
solomon
john
sat
down
and
the
family
all
sat
round
the
table
looking
at
him
he
had
his
pen
his
ink
and
his
paper
he
dipped
his
pen
into
the
ink
and
held
it
over
the
paper
and
thought
a
minute
and
then
said
but
i
haven
t
got
anything
to
peterkin
wishes
to
go
to
drive
one
morning
peterkin
was
feeling
very
tired
as
she
had
been
having
a
great
many
things
to
think
of
and
she
said
to
peterkin
i
believe
i
shall
take
a
ride
this
morning
and
the
little
boys
cried
out
oh
may
we
go
too
peterkin
said
that
elizabeth
eliza
and
the
little
boys
might
go
so
peterkin
had
the
horse
put
into
the
carryall
and
he
and
agamemnon
went
off
to
their
business
and
solomon
john
to
school
and
peterkin
began
to
get
ready
for
her
ride
she
had
some
currants
she
wanted
to
carry
to
old
twomly
and
some
gooseberries
for
somebody
else
and
elizabeth
eliza
wanted
to
pick
some
flowers
to
take
to
the
minister
s
wife
so
it
took
them
a
long
time
to
prepare
the
little
boys
went
out
to
pick
the
currants
and
the
gooseberries
and
elizabeth
eliza
went
out
for
her
flowers
and
peterkin
put
on
her
and
in
time
they
were
all
ready
the
little
boys
were
in
their
boots
and
they
got
into
the
carriage
elizabeth
eliza
was
to
drive
so
she
sat
on
the
front
seat
and
took
up
the
reins
and
the
horse
started
off
merrily
and
then
suddenly
stopped
and
would
not
go
any
farther
elizabeth
eliza
shook
the
reins
and
pulled
them
and
then
she
clucked
to
the
horse
and
peterkin
clucked
and
the
little
boys
whistled
and
shouted
but
still
the
horse
would
not
go
we
shall
have
to
whip
him
said
elizabeth
eliza
now
peterkin
never
liked
to
use
the
whip
but
as
the
horse
would
not
go
she
said
she
would
get
out
and
turn
her
head
the
other
way
while
elizabeth
eliza
whipped
the
horse
and
when
he
began
to
go
she
would
hurry
and
get
in
so
they
tried
this
but
the
horse
would
not
stir
perhaps
we
have
too
heavy
a
load
said
peterkin
as
she
got
in
so
they
took
out
the
currants
and
the
gooseberries
and
the
flowers
but
still
the
horse
would
not
go
one
of
the
neighbors
from
the
opposite
house
looking
out
just
then
called
out
to
them
to
try
the
whip
there
was
a
high
wind
and
they
could
not
hear
exactly
what
she
said
i
have
tried
the
whip
said
elizabeth
eliza
she
says
whips
such
as
you
eat
said
one
of
the
little
boys
we
might
make
those
said
peterkin
thoughtfully
we
have
got
plenty
of
cream
said
elizabeth
eliza
yes
let
us
have
some
whips
cried
the
little
boys
getting
out
and
the
opposite
neighbor
cried
out
something
about
whips
and
the
wind
was
very
high
so
they
went
into
the
kitchen
and
whipped
up
the
cream
and
made
some
very
delicious
whips
and
the
little
boys
tasted
all
round
and
they
all
thought
they
were
very
nice
they
carried
some
out
to
the
horse
who
swallowed
it
down
very
quickly
that
is
just
what
he
wanted
said
peterkin
now
he
will
certainly
go
so
they
all
got
into
the
carriage
again
and
put
in
the
currants
and
the
gooseberries
and
the
flowers
and
elizabeth
eliza
shook
the
reins
and
they
all
clucked
but
still
the
horse
would
not
go
we
must
either
give
up
our
ride
said
peterkin
mournfully
or
else
send
over
to
the
lady
from
philadelphia
and
see
what
she
will
the
little
boys
jumped
out
as
quickly
as
they
could
they
were
eager
to
go
and
ask
the
lady
from
philadelphia
elizabeth
eliza
went
with
them
while
her
mother
took
the
reins
they
found
that
the
lady
from
philadelphia
was
very
ill
that
day
and
was
in
her
bed
but
when
she
was
told
what
the
trouble
was
she
very
kindly
said
they
might
draw
up
the
curtain
from
the
window
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
open
the
blinds
and
she
would
see
then
she
asked
for
her
and
looked
through
it
across
the
way
up
the
street
to
peterkin
s
door
after
she
had
looked
through
the
glass
she
laid
it
down
leaned
her
head
back
against
the
pillow
for
she
was
very
tired
and
then
said
why
don
t
you
unchain
the
horse
from
the
elizabeth
eliza
and
the
little
boys
looked
at
one
another
and
then
hurried
back
to
the
house
and
told
their
mother
the
horse
was
untied
and
they
all
went
to
ride
the
peterkins
at
home
at
dinner
another
little
incident
occurred
in
the
peterkin
family
this
was
at
they
sat
down
to
a
dish
of
boiled
ham
now
it
was
a
peculiarity
of
the
children
of
the
family
that
half
of
them
liked
fat
and
half
liked
lean
peterkin
sat
down
to
cut
the
ham
but
the
ham
turned
out
to
be
a
very
remarkable
one
the
fat
and
the
lean
came
in
separate
slices
first
one
of
lean
than
one
of
fat
then
two
slices
of
lean
and
so
on
peterkin
began
as
usual
by
helping
the
children
first
according
to
their
age
now
agamemnon
who
liked
lean
got
a
fat
slice
and
elizabeth
eliza
who
preferred
fat
had
a
lean
slice
solomon
john
who
could
eat
nothing
but
lean
was
helped
to
fat
and
so
on
nobody
had
what
he
could
eat
it
was
a
rule
of
the
peterkin
family
that
no
one
should
eat
any
of
the
vegetables
without
some
of
the
meat
so
now
although
the
children
saw
upon
their
plates
and
squash
and
tomato
and
sweet
potato
and
sour
potato
not
one
of
them
could
eat
a
mouthful
because
not
one
was
satisfied
with
the
meat
and
peterkin
however
liked
both
fat
and
lean
and
were
making
a
very
good
meal
when
they
looked
up
and
saw
the
children
all
sitting
eating
nothing
and
looking
dissatisfied
into
their
plates
what
is
the
matter
now
said
peterkin
but
the
children
were
taught
not
to
speak
at
table
agamemnon
however
made
a
sign
of
disgust
at
his
fat
and
elizabeth
eliza
at
her
lean
and
so
on
and
they
presently
discovered
what
was
the
difficulty
what
shall
be
done
now
said
peterkin
they
all
sat
and
thought
for
a
little
while
at
last
said
peterkin
rather
uncertainly
suppose
we
ask
the
lady
from
philadelphia
what
is
best
to
be
but
peterkin
said
he
didn
t
like
to
go
to
her
for
everything
let
the
children
try
and
eat
their
dinner
as
it
was
and
they
all
tried
but
they
couldn
t
very
well
said
peterkin
let
them
go
and
ask
the
lady
from
all
of
us
cried
one
of
the
little
boys
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
yes
said
peterkin
only
put
on
your
and
they
hurried
out
of
the
house
the
lady
from
philadelphia
was
just
going
in
to
her
dinner
but
she
kindly
stopped
in
the
entry
to
hear
what
the
trouble
was
agamemnon
and
elizabeth
eliza
told
her
all
the
difficulty
and
the
lady
from
philadelphia
said
but
why
don
t
you
give
the
slices
of
fat
to
those
who
like
the
fat
and
the
slices
of
lean
to
those
who
like
the
lean
they
looked
at
one
another
agamemnon
looked
at
elizabeth
eliza
and
solomon
john
looked
at
the
little
boys
why
didn
t
we
think
of
that
said
they
and
ran
home
to
tell
their
mother
why
the
peterkins
had
a
late
dinner
the
trouble
was
in
the
all
had
seated
themselves
at
the
and
amanda
had
gone
to
take
out
the
dinner
she
had
sent
up
from
the
kitchen
on
the
but
something
was
the
matter
she
could
not
pull
it
up
there
was
the
dinner
but
she
could
not
reach
it
all
the
family
in
turn
went
and
tried
all
pulled
together
in
vain
the
dinner
could
not
be
stirred
no
dinner
exclaimed
agamemnon
i
am
quite
hungry
said
solomon
john
at
last
peterkin
said
i
am
not
proud
i
am
willing
to
dine
in
the
this
room
was
below
the
all
consented
to
this
each
one
went
down
taking
a
napkin
the
cook
laid
the
kitchen
table
put
on
it
her
best
and
the
family
sat
down
amanda
went
to
the
for
the
dinner
but
she
could
not
move
it
down
the
family
were
all
in
dismay
there
was
the
dinner
between
the
kitchen
and
and
there
were
they
all
hungry
to
eat
it
what
is
there
for
dinner
asked
peterkin
roast
turkey
said
peterkin
peterkin
lifted
his
eyes
to
the
ceiling
squash
tomato
potato
and
sweet
potato
peterkin
continued
sweet
potato
exclaimed
both
the
little
boys
i
am
very
glad
now
that
i
did
not
have
cranberry
said
peterkin
anxious
to
find
a
bright
point
let
us
sit
down
and
think
about
it
said
peterkin
i
have
an
idea
said
agamemnon
after
a
while
let
us
hear
it
said
peterkin
let
each
one
speak
his
the
turkey
said
agamemnon
must
be
just
above
the
kitchen
door
if
i
had
a
ladder
and
an
axe
i
could
cut
away
the
plastering
and
reach
that
is
a
great
idea
said
peterkin
if
you
think
you
could
do
it
said
peterkin
would
it
not
be
better
to
have
a
carpenter
asked
elizabeth
eliza
a
carpenter
might
have
a
ladder
and
an
axe
and
i
think
we
have
neither
said
peterkin
a
carpenter
a
carpenter
exclaimed
the
rest
it
was
decided
that
peterkin
solomon
john
and
the
little
boys
should
go
in
search
of
a
carpenter
agamemnon
proposed
that
meanwhile
he
should
go
and
borrow
a
book
for
he
had
another
idea
this
affair
of
the
turkey
he
said
reminds
me
of
those
buried
cities
that
have
been
dug
out
herculaneum
for
oh
yes
interrupted
elizabeth
eliza
and
yes
said
agamemnon
they
found
there
pots
and
kettles
now
i
should
like
to
know
how
they
did
it
and
i
mean
to
borrow
a
book
and
read
i
think
it
was
done
with
a
so
the
party
set
out
but
when
peterkin
reached
the
carpenter
s
shop
there
was
no
carpenter
to
be
found
there
he
must
be
at
his
house
eating
his
dinner
suggested
solomon
john
happy
man
exclaimed
peterkin
he
has
a
dinner
to
eat
they
went
to
the
carpenter
s
house
but
found
he
had
gone
out
of
town
for
a
day
s
job
but
his
wife
told
them
that
he
always
came
back
at
night
to
ring
the
clock
bell
we
must
wait
till
then
said
peterkin
with
an
effort
at
cheerfulness
at
home
he
found
agamemnon
reading
his
book
and
all
sat
down
to
hear
of
herculaneum
and
pompeii
time
passed
on
and
the
question
arose
about
tea
would
it
do
to
have
tea
when
they
had
had
no
dinner
a
part
of
the
family
thought
it
would
not
do
the
rest
wanted
tea
i
suppose
you
remember
the
wise
lady
of
philadelphia
who
was
here
not
long
ago
said
peterkin
oh
yes
said
peterkin
let
us
try
to
think
what
she
would
advise
us
said
peterkin
i
wish
she
were
here
said
elizabeth
eliza
i
think
said
peterkin
she
would
say
let
them
that
want
tea
have
it
the
rest
can
go
so
they
had
tea
and
as
it
proved
all
sat
down
to
it
but
not
much
was
eaten
as
there
had
been
no
dinner
when
the
clock
bell
was
heard
agamemnon
solomon
john
and
the
little
boys
rushed
to
the
church
and
found
the
carpenter
they
asked
him
to
bring
a
ladder
axes
and
pickaxe
as
he
felt
it
might
be
a
case
of
fire
he
brought
also
his
when
the
matter
was
explained
to
him
he
went
into
the
looked
into
the
untwisted
a
cord
and
arranged
the
weight
and
pulled
up
the
dinner
there
was
a
family
shout
the
trouble
was
in
the
weight
said
the
carpenter
that
is
why
it
is
called
a
solomon
john
explained
to
the
little
boys
the
dinner
was
put
upon
the
table
peterkin
frugally
suggested
that
they
might
now
keep
it
for
the
next
day
as
was
almost
gone
and
they
had
had
tea
but
nobody
listened
all
sat
down
to
the
roast
turkey
and
amanda
warmed
over
the
vegetables
patient
waiters
are
no
losers
said
agamemnon
the
peterkins
summer
journey
in
fact
it
was
their
last
summer
s
journey
for
it
had
been
planned
then
but
there
had
been
so
many
difficulties
it
had
been
delayed
the
first
trouble
had
been
about
trunks
the
family
did
not
own
a
trunk
suitable
for
travelling
agamemnon
had
his
valise
that
he
had
used
when
he
stayed
a
week
at
a
time
at
the
academy
and
a
trunk
had
been
bought
for
elizabeth
eliza
when
she
went
to
the
seminary
solomon
john
and
peterkin
each
had
his
but
all
these
were
too
small
for
the
family
and
the
little
boys
wanted
to
carry
their
kite
peterkin
suggested
her
grandmother
s
trunk
this
was
a
very
large
and
capacious
it
would
hold
everything
they
would
want
to
carry
except
what
would
go
in
elizabeth
eliza
s
trunk
or
the
valise
and
bags
everybody
was
delighted
at
this
idea
it
was
agreed
that
the
next
day
the
things
should
be
brought
into
peterkin
s
room
for
her
to
see
if
they
could
all
be
packed
if
we
can
get
along
said
elizabeth
eliza
without
having
to
ask
advice
i
shall
be
glad
yes
said
peterkin
it
is
time
now
for
people
to
be
coming
to
ask
advice
of
the
next
morning
peterkin
began
by
taking
out
the
things
that
were
already
in
the
trunk
here
were
last
year
s
winter
things
and
not
only
these
but
old
clothes
that
had
been
put
away
peterkin
s
the
skirts
the
little
boys
used
to
wear
before
they
put
on
jackets
and
trousers
all
day
peterkin
worked
over
the
trunk
putting
away
the
old
things
putting
in
the
new
she
packed
up
all
the
clothes
she
could
think
of
both
summer
and
winter
ones
because
you
never
can
tell
what
sort
of
weather
you
will
have
agamemnon
fetched
his
books
and
solomon
john
his
there
were
her
own
and
elizabeth
eliza
s
best
bonnets
in
a
bandbox
also
solomon
john
s
hats
for
he
had
an
old
one
and
a
new
one
he
bought
a
new
hat
for
fishing
with
a
very
wide
brim
and
deep
crown
all
of
heavy
straw
agamemnon
brought
down
a
large
heavy
dictionary
and
an
atlas
still
larger
this
contained
maps
of
all
the
countries
in
the
world
i
have
never
had
a
chance
to
look
at
them
he
said
but
when
one
travels
then
is
the
time
to
study
peterkin
wanted
to
take
his
so
peterkin
packed
his
it
gave
her
some
trouble
for
it
came
to
her
just
as
she
had
packed
her
summer
dresses
at
first
she
thought
it
would
help
to
smooth
the
dresses
and
placed
it
on
top
but
she
was
forced
to
take
all
out
and
set
it
at
the
bottom
this
was
not
so
much
matter
as
she
had
not
yet
the
right
dresses
to
put
in
both
peterkin
and
elizabeth
eliza
would
need
new
dresses
for
this
occasion
the
little
boys
hoops
went
in
so
did
their
boots
in
case
it
should
not
rain
when
they
started
they
each
had
a
hoe
and
shovel
and
some
baskets
that
were
packed
peterkin
called
in
all
the
family
on
the
evening
of
the
second
day
to
see
how
she
had
succeeded
everything
was
packed
even
the
little
boys
kite
lay
smoothly
on
the
top
i
like
to
see
a
thing
so
nicely
done
said
peterkin
the
next
thing
was
to
cord
up
the
trunk
and
peterkin
tried
to
move
it
but
neither
he
nor
agamemnon
nor
solomon
john
could
lift
it
alone
or
all
together
here
was
a
serious
difficulty
solomon
john
tried
to
make
light
of
it
expressmen
could
lift
it
expressmen
were
used
to
such
but
we
did
not
plan
expressing
it
said
peterkin
in
a
discouraged
tone
we
can
take
a
carriage
said
solomon
john
i
am
afraid
the
trunk
would
not
go
on
the
back
of
a
carriage
said
peterkin
the
hackman
could
not
lift
it
either
said
peterkin
people
do
travel
with
a
great
deal
of
baggage
said
elizabeth
eliza
and
with
very
large
trunks
said
agamemnon
still
they
are
trunks
that
can
be
moved
said
peterkin
giving
another
try
at
the
trunk
in
vain
i
am
afraid
we
must
give
it
up
he
said
it
would
be
such
a
trouble
in
going
from
place
to
we
would
not
mind
if
we
got
it
to
the
place
said
elizabeth
eliza
but
how
to
get
it
there
peterkin
asked
with
a
sigh
this
is
our
first
obstacle
said
agamemnon
we
must
do
our
best
to
conquer
what
is
an
obstacle
asked
the
little
boys
it
is
the
trunk
said
solomon
john
suppose
we
look
out
the
word
in
the
dictionary
said
agamemnon
taking
the
large
volume
from
the
trunk
ah
here
it
is
and
he
read
obstacle
an
that
is
a
worse
word
than
the
other
said
one
of
the
little
boys
but
listen
to
this
and
agamemnon
continued
impediment
is
something
that
entangles
the
feet
obstacle
something
that
stands
in
the
way
obstruction
something
that
blocks
up
the
passage
hinderance
something
that
holds
the
trunk
is
all
these
said
peterkin
gloomily
it
does
not
entangle
the
feet
said
solomon
john
for
it
can
t
i
wish
it
could
said
the
little
boys
together
peterkin
spent
a
day
or
two
in
taking
the
things
out
of
the
trunk
and
putting
them
away
at
least
she
said
this
has
given
me
some
experience
in
and
the
little
boys
felt
as
if
they
had
quite
been
a
journey
but
the
family
did
not
like
to
give
up
their
plan
it
was
suggested
that
they
might
take
the
things
out
of
the
trunk
and
pack
it
at
the
station
the
little
boys
could
go
and
come
with
the
things
but
elizabeth
eliza
thought
the
place
too
public
gradually
the
old
contents
of
the
great
trunk
went
back
again
to
it
at
length
a
friend
unexpectedly
offered
to
lend
peterkin
a
family
trunk
but
it
was
late
in
the
season
and
so
the
journey
was
put
off
from
that
summer
but
now
the
trunk
was
sent
round
to
the
house
and
a
family
consultation
was
held
about
packing
it
many
things
would
have
to
be
left
at
home
it
was
so
much
smaller
than
the
grandmother
s
but
agamemnon
had
been
studying
the
atlas
through
the
winter
and
felt
familiar
with
the
more
important
places
so
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
take
it
and
peterkin
decided
to
leave
his
at
home
and
his
again
peterkin
spent
two
days
in
accommodating
the
things
with
great
care
and
discretion
and
by
borrowing
two
more
leather
bags
it
could
be
accomplished
everything
of
importance
could
be
packed
except
the
little
boys
kite
what
should
they
do
about
that
the
little
boys
proposed
carrying
it
in
their
hands
but
solomon
john
and
elizabeth
eliza
would
not
consent
to
this
i
do
think
it
is
one
of
the
cases
where
we
might
ask
the
advice
of
the
lady
from
philadelphia
said
peterkin
at
last
she
has
come
on
here
said
agamemnon
and
we
have
not
been
to
see
her
this
she
may
think
we
have
been
neglecting
her
suggested
peterkin
the
little
boys
begged
to
be
allowed
to
go
and
ask
her
opinion
about
the
kite
they
came
back
in
high
spirits
she
says
we
might
leave
this
one
at
home
and
make
a
new
kite
when
we
get
there
they
cried
what
a
sensible
idea
exclaimed
peterkin
and
i
may
have
leisure
to
help
we
ll
take
plenty
of
newspapers
said
solomon
john
and
twine
said
the
little
boys
and
this
matter
was
settled
the
question
then
was
when
should
they
go
the
peterkins
peterkin
awoke
one
morning
to
find
a
heavy
raging
the
wind
had
flung
the
snow
against
the
windows
had
heaped
it
up
around
the
house
and
thrown
it
into
huge
white
drifts
over
the
fields
covering
hedges
and
fences
peterkin
went
from
one
window
to
the
other
to
look
out
but
nothing
could
be
seen
but
the
driving
storm
and
the
deep
white
snow
even
bromwick
s
house
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
was
hidden
by
the
flakes
what
shall
i
do
about
it
thought
peterkin
no
roads
cleared
out
of
course
there
ll
be
no
butcher
and
no
milkman
the
first
thing
to
be
done
was
to
wake
up
all
the
family
early
for
there
was
enough
in
the
house
for
breakfast
and
there
was
no
knowing
when
they
would
have
anything
more
to
eat
it
was
best
to
secure
the
breakfast
first
so
she
went
from
one
room
to
the
other
as
soon
as
it
was
light
waking
the
family
and
before
long
all
were
dressed
and
downstairs
and
then
all
went
round
the
house
to
see
what
had
happened
all
the
that
there
were
were
frozen
the
milk
was
frozen
they
could
open
the
door
into
the
but
the
door
into
the
yard
was
banked
up
with
snow
and
the
front
door
and
the
piazza
door
and
the
side
door
stuck
nobody
could
get
in
or
out
meanwhile
amanda
the
cook
had
succeeded
in
making
the
kitchen
fire
but
had
discovered
there
was
no
furnace
coal
the
furnace
coal
was
to
have
come
said
peterkin
apologetically
nothing
will
come
said
peterkin
shivering
but
a
fire
could
be
made
in
a
stove
in
the
all
were
glad
to
sit
down
to
breakfast
and
hot
coffee
the
little
boys
were
much
pleased
to
have
for
breakfast
when
we
get
a
little
warm
said
peterkin
we
will
consider
what
is
to
be
i
am
thankful
i
ordered
the
sausages
yesterday
said
peterkin
i
was
to
have
had
a
leg
of
mutton
nothing
will
come
said
agamemnon
gloomily
are
these
sausages
the
last
meat
in
the
house
asked
peterkin
yes
said
peterkin
the
potatoes
also
were
gone
the
barrel
of
apples
empty
and
she
had
meant
to
order
more
flour
that
very
day
then
we
are
eating
our
last
provisions
said
solomon
john
helping
himself
to
another
sausage
i
almost
wish
we
had
stayed
in
bed
said
agamemnon
i
thought
it
best
to
make
sure
of
our
breakfast
first
repeated
peterkin
shall
we
literally
have
nothing
left
to
eat
asked
peterkin
there
s
the
pig
suggested
solomon
john
yes
happily
the
pigsty
was
at
the
end
of
the
and
could
be
reached
under
cover
but
some
of
the
family
could
not
eat
fresh
pork
we
should
have
to
corn
part
of
him
said
agamemnon
my
butcher
has
always
told
me
said
peterkin
that
if
i
wanted
a
ham
i
must
keep
a
pig
now
we
have
the
pig
but
have
not
the
ham
perhaps
we
could
corn
one
or
two
of
his
legs
suggested
one
of
the
little
boys
we
need
not
settle
that
now
said
peterkin
at
least
the
pig
will
keep
us
from
the
little
boys
looked
serious
they
were
fond
of
their
pig
if
we
had
only
decided
to
keep
a
cow
said
peterkin
alas
yes
said
peterkin
one
learns
a
great
many
things
too
late
then
we
might
have
had
all
the
time
exclaimed
the
little
boys
indeed
the
little
boys
in
spite
of
the
prospect
of
starving
were
quite
pleasantly
excited
at
the
idea
of
being
and
hurried
through
their
breakfasts
that
they
might
go
and
try
to
shovel
out
a
path
from
one
of
the
doors
i
ought
to
know
more
about
the
said
peterkin
now
i
shut
off
the
water
last
night
in
the
or
else
i
forgot
to
and
i
ought
to
have
shut
it
off
in
the
the
little
boys
came
back
such
a
wind
at
the
front
door
they
were
going
to
try
the
side
door
another
thing
i
have
learned
said
peterkin
is
not
to
have
all
the
doors
on
one
side
of
the
house
because
the
storm
blows
the
snow
against
all
the
solomon
john
started
up
let
us
see
if
we
are
blocked
up
on
the
east
side
of
the
house
he
exclaimed
of
what
use
asked
peterkin
since
we
have
no
door
on
the
east
side
we
could
cut
one
said
solomon
john
yes
we
could
cut
a
door
exclaimed
agamemnon
but
how
can
we
tell
whether
there
is
any
snow
there
asked
elizabeth
eliza
for
there
is
no
in
fact
the
east
side
of
the
peterkins
house
formed
a
blank
wall
the
owner
had
originally
planned
a
little
block
of
houses
he
had
completed
only
one
very
semi
and
very
detached
it
is
not
necessary
to
see
said
agamemnon
profoundly
of
course
if
the
storm
blows
against
this
side
of
the
house
the
house
itself
must
keep
the
snow
from
the
other
yes
said
solomon
john
there
must
be
a
space
clear
of
snow
on
the
east
side
of
the
house
and
if
we
could
open
a
way
to
that
we
could
open
a
way
to
the
butcher
said
peterkin
promptly
agamemnon
went
for
his
he
had
kept
one
in
the
house
ever
since
the
adventure
of
the
what
part
of
the
wall
had
we
better
attack
asked
peterkin
peterkin
was
alarmed
what
will
mudge
the
owner
of
the
house
think
of
it
she
exclaimed
have
we
a
right
to
injure
the
wall
of
the
house
it
is
right
to
preserve
ourselves
from
starving
said
peterkin
the
drowning
man
must
snatch
at
a
straw
it
is
better
that
he
should
find
his
house
chopped
a
little
when
the
thaw
comes
said
elizabeth
eliza
than
that
he
should
find
us
lying
about
the
house
dead
of
hunger
upon
the
peterkin
was
partially
convinced
the
little
boys
came
in
to
warm
their
hands
they
had
not
succeeded
in
opening
the
side
door
and
were
planning
trying
to
open
the
door
from
the
to
the
garden
that
would
be
of
no
use
said
peterkin
the
butcher
can
not
get
into
the
but
we
might
shovel
off
the
snow
suggested
one
of
the
little
boys
and
dig
down
to
some
of
last
year
s
meanwhile
peterkin
agamemnon
and
solomon
john
had
been
bringing
together
their
carpenter
s
tools
and
elizabeth
eliza
proposed
using
a
gouge
if
they
would
choose
the
right
spot
to
begin
the
little
boys
were
delighted
with
the
plan
and
hastened
to
find
one
a
little
hatchet
and
the
other
a
gimlet
even
amanda
armed
herself
with
a
poker
it
would
be
better
to
begin
on
the
ground
floor
said
peterkin
except
that
we
may
meet
with
a
stone
foundation
said
solomon
john
if
the
wall
is
thinner
upstairs
said
agamemnon
it
will
do
as
well
to
cut
a
window
as
a
door
and
haul
up
anything
the
butcher
may
bring
below
in
his
everybody
began
to
pound
a
little
on
the
wall
to
find
a
favorable
place
and
there
was
a
great
deal
of
noise
the
little
boys
actually
cut
a
bit
out
of
the
plastering
with
their
hatchet
and
gimlet
solomon
john
confided
to
elizabeth
eliza
that
it
reminded
him
of
stories
of
prisoners
who
cut
themselves
free
through
stone
walls
after
days
and
days
of
secret
labor
peterkin
even
had
come
with
a
pair
of
tongs
in
her
hand
she
was
interrupted
by
a
voice
behind
her
here
s
your
leg
of
mutton
marm
it
was
the
butcher
how
had
he
got
in
excuse
me
marm
for
coming
in
at
the
side
door
but
the
back
gate
is
kinder
blocked
up
you
were
making
such
a
pounding
i
could
not
make
anybody
hear
me
knock
at
the
side
but
how
did
you
make
a
path
to
the
door
asked
peterkin
you
must
have
been
working
at
it
a
long
time
it
must
be
near
noon
i
m
about
on
regular
time
answered
the
butcher
the
town
team
has
cleared
out
the
high
road
and
the
wind
has
been
down
the
last
the
storm
is
true
enough
the
peterkins
had
been
so
busy
inside
the
house
they
had
not
noticed
the
ceasing
of
the
storm
outside
and
we
were
all
up
an
hour
earlier
than
usual
said
peterkin
when
the
butcher
left
he
had
not
explained
to
the
butcher
why
he
had
a
pickaxe
in
his
hand
if
we
had
lain
abed
till
the
usual
time
said
solomon
john
we
should
have
been
all
for
here
is
the
milkman
said
elizabeth
eliza
as
a
knock
was
now
heard
at
the
side
door
it
is
a
good
thing
to
learn
said
peterkin
not
to
get
up
any
earlier
than
is
the
peterkins
decide
to
keep
a
cow
not
that
they
were
fond
of
drinking
milk
nor
that
they
drank
very
much
but
for
that
reason
peterkin
thought
it
would
be
well
to
have
a
cow
to
encourage
the
family
to
drink
more
as
he
felt
it
would
be
so
healthy
peterkin
recalled
the
troubles
of
the
last
cold
winter
and
how
near
they
came
to
starving
when
they
were
shut
up
in
a
severe
and
the
burst
and
the
milk
was
frozen
if
the
could
open
out
of
the
such
trouble
might
be
prevented
tony
larkin
was
to
come
over
and
milk
the
cow
every
morning
and
agamemnon
and
solomon
john
agreed
to
learn
how
to
milk
in
case
tony
should
be
snowed
up
or
have
the
in
the
course
of
the
winter
the
little
boys
thought
they
knew
how
already
but
if
they
were
to
have
three
or
four
pailfuls
of
milk
every
day
it
was
important
to
know
where
to
keep
it
one
way
will
be
said
peterkin
to
use
a
great
deal
every
day
we
will
make
that
will
be
admirable
thought
peterkin
and
custards
suggested
solomon
john
and
syllabub
said
elizabeth
eliza
and
cakes
exclaimed
the
little
boys
we
don
t
need
the
milk
for
cakes
said
peterkin
the
little
boys
thought
they
might
have
a
tree
instead
of
a
cow
you
could
have
the
milk
from
the
and
it
would
be
pleasant
climbing
the
tree
and
you
would
not
have
to
feed
it
yes
said
peterkin
we
shall
have
to
feed
the
where
shall
we
pasture
her
asked
agamemnon
up
on
the
hills
up
on
the
hills
exclaimed
the
little
boys
where
there
are
a
great
many
bars
to
take
down
and
peterkin
had
been
thinking
of
their
own
little
lot
behind
the
house
but
i
don
t
know
he
said
but
the
cow
might
eat
off
all
the
grass
in
one
day
and
there
would
not
be
any
left
for
unless
the
grass
grew
fast
enough
every
agamemnon
said
it
would
depend
upon
the
season
in
a
rainy
season
the
grass
would
come
up
very
fast
in
a
drought
it
might
not
grow
at
all
i
suppose
said
peterkin
that
is
the
worst
of
having
a
cow
there
might
be
a
peterkin
thought
they
might
make
some
calculation
from
the
quantity
of
grass
in
the
lot
solomon
john
suggested
that
measurements
might
be
made
by
seeing
how
much
grass
the
bromwicks
cow
opposite
them
eat
up
in
a
day
the
little
boys
agreed
to
go
over
and
spend
the
day
on
the
bromwicks
fence
and
take
an
observation
the
trouble
would
be
said
elizabeth
eliza
that
cows
walk
about
so
and
the
bromwicks
yard
is
very
large
now
she
would
be
eating
in
one
place
and
then
she
would
walk
to
another
she
would
not
be
eating
all
the
time
a
part
of
the
time
she
would
be
the
little
boys
thought
they
should
like
nothing
better
than
to
have
some
sticks
and
keep
the
cow
in
one
corner
of
the
yard
till
the
calculations
were
made
but
elizabeth
eliza
was
afraid
the
bromwicks
would
not
like
it
of
course
it
would
bring
all
the
boys
in
the
school
about
the
place
and
very
likely
they
would
make
the
cow
agamemnon
recalled
that
bromwick
once
wanted
to
hire
peterkin
s
lot
for
his
cow
peterkin
started
up
that
is
true
and
of
course
bromwick
must
have
known
there
was
feed
enough
for
one
and
the
reason
you
didn
t
let
him
have
it
said
solomon
john
was
that
elizabeth
eliza
was
afraid
of
i
did
not
like
the
idea
said
elizabeth
eliza
of
their
cow
s
looking
at
me
over
the
top
of
the
fence
perhaps
when
i
should
be
planting
the
sweet
peas
in
the
garden
i
hope
our
cow
would
be
a
quiet
one
i
should
not
like
her
jumping
over
the
fence
into
the
peterkin
declared
that
he
should
buy
a
cow
of
the
quietest
kind
i
should
think
something
might
be
done
about
covering
her
horns
said
peterkin
that
seems
the
most
dangerous
part
perhaps
they
might
be
padded
with
elizabeth
eliza
said
cows
were
built
so
large
and
clumsy
that
if
they
came
at
you
they
could
not
help
knocking
you
over
the
little
boys
would
prefer
having
the
pasture
a
great
way
off
half
the
fun
of
having
a
cow
would
be
going
up
on
the
hills
after
her
agamemnon
thought
the
feed
was
not
so
good
on
the
hills
the
cow
would
like
it
ever
so
much
better
the
little
boys
declared
on
account
of
the
variety
if
she
did
not
like
the
rocks
and
the
bushes
she
could
walk
round
and
find
the
grassy
i
am
not
sure
said
elizabeth
eliza
but
it
would
be
less
dangerous
to
keep
the
cow
in
the
lot
behind
the
house
because
she
would
not
be
coming
and
going
morning
and
night
in
that
jerky
way
the
larkins
cows
come
home
they
don
t
mind
which
gate
they
rush
in
at
i
should
hate
to
have
our
cow
dash
into
our
front
yard
just
as
i
was
coming
home
of
an
that
is
true
said
peterkin
we
can
have
the
door
of
the
open
directly
into
the
pasture
and
save
the
coming
and
the
little
boys
were
quite
disappointed
the
cow
would
miss
the
exercise
and
they
would
lose
a
great
pleasure
solomon
john
suggested
that
they
might
sit
on
the
fence
and
watch
the
cow
it
was
decided
to
keep
the
cow
in
their
own
pasture
and
as
they
were
to
put
on
an
end
kitchen
it
would
be
perfectly
easy
to
build
a
dairy
the
cow
proved
a
quiet
one
she
was
a
little
excited
when
all
the
family
stood
round
at
the
first
milking
and
watched
her
slowly
walking
into
the
shed
elizabeth
eliza
had
her
scarlet
sack
dyed
brown
a
fortnight
before
it
was
the
one
she
did
her
gardening
in
and
it
might
have
infuriated
the
cow
and
she
kept
out
of
the
garden
the
first
day
or
two
peterkin
and
elizabeth
eliza
bought
the
best
kind
of
of
every
size
but
there
was
a
little
disappointment
about
the
taste
of
the
milk
the
little
boys
liked
it
and
drank
large
mugs
of
it
elizabeth
eliza
said
she
could
never
learn
to
love
milk
warm
from
the
cow
though
she
would
like
to
do
her
best
to
patronize
the
cow
peterkin
was
afraid
amanda
did
not
under
stand
about
taking
care
of
the
milk
yet
she
had
been
down
to
overlook
her
and
she
was
sure
the
pans
and
the
closet
were
all
clean
suppose
we
send
a
pitcher
of
cream
over
to
the
lady
from
philadelphia
to
try
said
elizabeth
eliza
it
will
be
a
pretty
attention
before
she
it
might
be
awkward
if
she
didn
t
like
it
said
solomon
john
perhaps
something
is
the
matter
with
the
i
gave
the
cow
an
apple
to
eat
yesterday
said
one
of
the
little
boys
remorsefully
elizabeth
eliza
went
over
and
peterkin
too
and
explained
all
to
the
lady
from
philadelphia
asking
her
to
taste
the
milk
the
lady
from
philadelphia
tasted
and
said
the
truth
was
that
the
milk
was
sour
i
was
afraid
it
was
so
said
peterkin
but
i
didn
t
know
what
to
expect
from
these
new
kinds
of
the
lady
from
philadelphia
asked
where
the
milk
was
kept
in
the
new
dairy
answered
elizabeth
eliza
is
that
in
a
cool
place
asked
the
lady
from
philadelphia
elizabeth
eliza
explained
it
was
close
by
the
new
kitchen
is
it
near
the
chimney
inquired
the
lady
from
philadelphia
it
is
directly
back
of
the
chimney
and
the
new
replied
elizabeth
eliza
i
suppose
it
is
too
hot
well
well
said
peterkin
that
is
it
last
winter
the
milk
froze
and
now
we
have
gone
to
the
other
extreme
where
shall
we
put
our
dairy
the
peterkins
early
in
the
autumn
the
peterkins
began
to
prepare
for
their
everything
was
done
in
great
privacy
as
it
was
to
be
a
surprise
to
the
neighbors
as
well
as
to
the
rest
of
the
family
peterkin
had
been
up
to
bromwick
s
and
with
his
consent
selected
the
tree
agamemnon
went
to
look
at
it
occasionally
after
dark
and
solomon
john
made
frequent
visits
to
it
mornings
just
after
sunrise
peterkin
drove
elizabeth
eliza
and
her
mother
that
way
and
pointed
furtively
to
it
with
his
whip
but
none
of
them
ever
spoke
of
it
aloud
to
each
other
it
was
suspected
that
the
little
boys
had
been
to
see
it
wednesday
and
saturday
afternoons
but
they
came
home
with
their
pockets
full
of
chestnuts
and
said
nothing
about
it
at
length
peterkin
had
it
cut
down
and
brought
secretly
into
the
larkin
s
barn
a
week
or
two
before
christmas
a
measurement
was
made
of
it
with
elizabeth
eliza
s
to
peterkin
s
great
dismay
it
was
discovered
that
it
was
too
high
to
stand
in
the
back
parlor
this
fact
was
brought
out
at
a
secret
council
of
and
peterkin
elizabeth
eliza
and
agamemnon
agamemnon
suggested
that
it
might
be
set
up
slanting
but
peterkin
was
very
sure
it
would
make
her
dizzy
and
the
candles
would
drip
but
a
brilliant
idea
came
to
peterkin
he
proposed
that
the
ceiling
of
the
parlor
should
be
raised
to
make
room
for
the
top
of
the
tree
elizabeth
eliza
thought
the
space
would
need
to
be
quite
large
it
must
not
be
like
a
small
box
or
you
could
not
see
the
tree
yes
said
peterkin
i
should
have
the
ceiling
lifted
all
across
the
room
the
effect
would
be
elizabeth
eliza
objected
to
having
the
whole
ceiling
raised
because
her
room
was
over
the
back
parlor
and
she
would
have
no
floor
while
the
alteration
was
going
on
which
would
be
very
awkward
besides
her
room
was
not
very
high
now
and
if
the
floor
were
raised
perhaps
she
could
not
walk
in
it
upright
peterkin
explained
that
he
didn
t
propose
altering
the
whole
ceiling
but
to
life
up
a
ridge
across
the
room
at
the
back
part
where
the
tree
was
to
stand
this
would
make
a
hump
to
be
sure
in
elizabeth
eliza
s
room
but
it
would
go
across
the
whole
room
elizabeth
eliza
said
she
would
not
mind
that
it
would
be
like
the
cuddy
thing
that
comes
up
on
the
deck
of
a
ship
that
you
sit
against
only
here
you
would
not
have
the
she
thought
she
should
like
it
for
a
rarity
she
might
use
it
for
a
divan
peterkin
thought
it
would
come
in
the
worn
place
of
the
carpet
and
might
be
a
convenience
in
making
the
carpet
over
agamemnon
was
afraid
there
would
be
trouble
in
keeping
the
matter
secret
for
it
would
be
a
long
piece
of
work
for
a
carpenter
but
peterkin
proposed
having
the
carpenter
for
a
day
or
two
for
a
number
of
other
jobs
one
of
them
was
to
make
all
the
chairs
in
the
house
of
the
same
height
for
peterkin
had
nearly
broken
her
spine
by
sitting
down
in
a
chair
that
she
had
supposed
was
her
own
and
it
had
proved
to
be
two
inches
lower
the
little
boys
were
now
large
enough
to
sit
in
any
chair
so
a
medium
was
fixed
upon
to
satisfy
all
the
family
and
the
chairs
were
made
uniformly
of
the
same
height
on
consulting
the
carpenter
however
he
insisted
that
the
tree
could
be
cut
off
at
the
lower
end
to
suit
the
height
of
the
parlor
and
demurred
at
so
great
a
change
as
altering
the
ceiling
but
peterkin
had
set
his
mind
upon
the
improvement
and
elizabeth
eliza
had
cut
her
carpet
in
preparation
for
it
so
the
into
the
back
parlor
were
closed
and
for
nearly
a
fortnight
before
christmas
there
was
great
litter
of
fallen
plastering
and
laths
and
chips
and
shavings
and
elizabeth
eliza
s
carpet
was
taken
up
and
the
furniture
had
to
be
changed
and
one
night
she
had
to
sleep
at
the
bromwicks
for
there
was
a
long
hole
in
her
floor
that
might
be
dangerous
all
this
delighted
the
little
boys
they
could
not
understand
what
was
going
on
perhaps
they
suspected
a
but
they
did
not
know
why
a
should
have
so
many
chips
and
were
still
more
astonished
at
the
hump
that
appeared
in
elizabeth
eliza
s
room
it
must
be
a
christmas
present
or
else
the
tree
in
a
box
some
aunts
and
uncles
too
arrived
a
day
or
two
before
christmas
with
some
small
cousins
these
cousins
occupied
the
attention
of
the
little
boys
and
there
was
a
great
deal
of
whispering
and
mystery
behind
doors
and
under
the
stairs
and
in
the
corners
of
the
entry
solomon
john
was
busy
privately
making
some
candles
for
the
tree
he
had
been
collecting
some
bayberries
as
he
understood
they
made
very
nice
candles
so
that
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
buy
any
the
elders
of
the
family
never
all
went
into
the
back
parlor
together
and
all
tried
not
to
see
what
was
going
on
peterkin
would
go
in
with
solomon
john
or
peterkin
with
elizabeth
eliza
or
elizabeth
eliza
and
agamemnon
and
solomon
john
the
little
boys
and
the
small
cousins
were
never
allowed
even
to
look
inside
the
room
elizabeth
eliza
meanwhile
went
into
town
a
number
of
times
she
wanted
to
consult
amanda
as
to
how
much
they
should
need
and
whether
they
could
make
it
at
home
as
they
had
cream
and
ice
she
was
pretty
busy
in
her
own
room
the
furniture
had
to
be
changed
and
the
carpet
altered
the
hump
was
higher
than
she
expected
there
was
danger
of
bumping
her
own
head
whenever
she
crossed
it
she
had
to
nail
some
padding
on
the
ceiling
for
fear
of
accidents
the
afternoon
before
christmas
elizabeth
eliza
solomon
john
and
their
father
collected
in
the
back
parlor
for
a
council
the
carpenters
had
done
their
work
and
the
tree
stood
at
its
full
height
at
the
back
of
the
room
the
top
stretching
up
into
the
space
arranged
for
it
all
the
chips
and
shavings
were
cleared
away
and
it
stood
on
a
neat
box
but
what
were
they
to
put
upon
the
tree
solomon
john
had
brought
in
his
supply
of
candles
but
they
proved
to
be
very
stringy
and
very
few
of
them
it
was
strange
how
many
bayberries
it
took
to
make
a
few
candles
the
little
boys
had
helped
him
and
he
had
gathered
as
much
as
a
bushel
of
bayberries
he
had
put
them
in
water
and
skimmed
off
the
wax
according
to
the
directions
but
there
was
so
little
wax
solomon
john
had
given
the
little
boys
some
of
the
bits
sawed
off
from
the
legs
of
the
chairs
he
had
suggested
that
they
should
cover
them
with
gilt
paper
to
answer
for
gilt
apples
without
telling
them
what
they
were
for
these
apples
a
little
blunt
at
the
end
and
the
candles
were
all
they
had
for
the
tree
after
all
her
trips
into
town
elizabeth
eliza
had
forgotten
to
bring
anything
for
it
i
thought
of
candies
and
she
said
but
i
concluded
if
we
made
caramels
ourselves
we
should
not
need
them
but
then
we
have
not
made
caramels
the
fact
is
that
day
my
head
was
full
of
my
carpet
i
had
bumped
it
pretty
badly
peterkin
wished
he
had
taken
instead
of
a
an
he
had
seen
in
october
full
of
red
fruit
but
the
leaves
would
have
fallen
off
by
this
time
said
elizabeth
eliza
and
the
apples
too
said
solomon
john
it
is
odd
i
should
have
forgotten
that
day
i
went
in
on
purpose
to
get
the
things
said
elizabeth
eliza
musingly
but
i
went
from
shop
to
shop
and
didn
t
know
exactly
what
to
get
i
saw
a
great
many
gilt
things
for
but
i
knew
the
little
boys
were
making
the
gilt
apples
there
were
plenty
of
candles
in
the
shops
but
i
knew
solomon
john
was
making
the
peterkin
thought
it
was
quite
natural
solomon
john
wondered
if
it
were
too
late
for
them
to
go
into
town
now
elizabeth
eliza
could
not
go
in
the
next
morning
for
there
was
to
be
a
grand
christmas
dinner
and
peterkin
could
not
be
spared
and
solomon
john
was
sure
he
and
agamemnon
would
not
know
what
to
buy
besides
they
would
want
to
try
the
candles
peterkin
asked
if
the
presents
everybody
had
been
preparing
would
not
answer
but
elizabeth
eliza
knew
they
would
be
too
heavy
a
gloom
came
over
the
room
there
was
only
a
flickering
gleam
from
one
of
solomon
john
s
candles
that
he
had
lighted
by
way
of
trial
solomon
john
again
proposed
going
into
town
he
lighted
a
match
to
examine
the
newspaper
about
the
trains
there
were
plenty
of
trains
coming
out
at
that
hour
but
none
going
in
except
a
very
late
one
that
would
not
leave
time
to
do
anything
and
come
back
we
could
go
in
elizabeth
eliza
and
i
said
solomon
john
but
we
should
not
have
time
to
buy
agamemnon
was
summoned
in
peterkin
was
entertaining
the
uncles
and
aunts
in
the
front
parlor
agamemnon
wished
there
was
time
to
study
up
something
about
electric
lights
if
they
could
only
have
a
calcium
light
solomon
john
s
candle
sputtered
and
went
out
at
this
moment
there
was
a
loud
knocking
at
the
front
door
the
little
boys
and
the
small
cousins
and
the
uncles
and
aunts
and
peterkin
hastened
to
see
what
was
the
matter
the
uncles
and
aunts
thought
somebody
s
house
must
be
on
fire
the
door
was
opened
and
there
was
a
man
white
with
flakes
for
it
was
beginning
to
snow
and
he
was
pulling
in
a
large
box
peterkin
supposed
it
contained
some
of
elizabeth
eliza
s
purchases
so
she
ordered
it
to
be
pushed
into
the
back
parlor
and
hastily
called
back
her
guests
and
the
little
boys
into
the
other
room
the
little
boys
and
the
small
cousins
were
sure
they
had
seen
santa
claus
himself
peterkin
lighted
the
gas
the
box
was
addressed
to
elizabeth
eliza
it
was
from
the
lady
from
philadelphia
she
had
gathered
a
hint
from
elizabeth
eliza
s
letters
that
there
was
to
be
a
and
had
filled
this
box
with
all
that
would
be
needed
it
was
opened
directly
there
was
every
kind
of
gilt
from
gilt
to
butterflies
on
springs
there
were
shining
flags
and
lanterns
and
birdcages
and
nests
with
birds
sitting
on
them
baskets
of
fruit
gilt
apples
and
bunches
of
grapes
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
whole
a
large
box
of
candles
and
a
box
of
philadelphia
bonbons
elizabeth
eliza
and
solomon
john
could
scarcely
keep
from
screaming
the
little
boys
and
the
small
cousins
knocked
on
the
to
ask
what
was
the
matter
hastily
peterkin
and
the
rest
took
out
the
things
and
hung
them
on
the
tree
and
put
on
the
candles
when
all
was
done
it
looked
so
well
that
peterkin
exclaimed
let
us
light
the
candles
now
and
send
to
invite
all
the
neighbors
and
have
the
tree
on
christmas
eve
and
so
it
was
that
the
peterkins
had
their
the
day
before
and
on
christmas
night
could
go
and
visit
their
neighbors
peterkin
s
twas
important
to
have
a
as
they
had
all
been
invited
by
everybody
the
bromwicks
the
tremletts
and
the
gibbonses
it
would
be
such
a
good
chance
to
pay
off
some
of
their
old
debts
now
that
the
lady
from
philadelphia
was
back
again
and
her
two
daughters
who
would
be
sure
to
make
it
all
go
off
well
but
as
soon
as
they
began
to
make
out
the
list
they
saw
there
were
too
many
to
have
at
once
for
there
were
but
twelve
cups
and
saucers
in
the
best
set
there
are
seven
of
us
to
begin
with
said
peterkin
we
need
not
all
drink
tea
said
peterkin
i
never
do
said
solomon
john
the
little
boys
never
did
and
we
could
have
coffee
too
suggested
elizabeth
eliza
that
would
take
as
many
cups
objected
agamemnon
we
could
use
the
set
for
the
coffee
answered
elizabeth
eliza
they
are
the
right
shape
besides
she
went
on
they
would
not
all
come
and
bromwick
for
instance
they
never
go
there
are
but
six
cups
in
the
set
said
peterkin
the
little
boys
said
there
were
plenty
of
saucers
and
peterkin
agreed
with
elizabeth
eliza
that
all
would
not
come
old
jeffers
never
went
out
there
are
three
of
the
tremletts
said
elizabeth
eliza
they
never
go
out
together
one
of
them
if
not
two
will
be
sure
to
have
the
headache
ann
maria
bromwick
would
come
and
the
three
gibbons
boys
and
their
sister
juliana
but
the
other
sisters
are
out
west
and
there
is
but
one
it
really
did
seem
safe
to
ask
they
would
be
sorry
after
it
was
over
that
they
had
not
asked
more
we
have
the
cow
said
peterkin
so
there
will
be
as
much
cream
and
milk
as
we
shall
and
our
own
pig
said
agamemnon
i
am
glad
we
had
it
salted
so
we
can
have
plenty
of
i
will
buy
a
chest
of
tea
exclaimed
peterkin
i
have
been
thinking
of
a
chest
for
some
peterkin
thought
a
whole
chest
would
not
be
needed
it
was
as
well
to
buy
the
tea
and
coffee
by
the
pound
but
peterkin
determined
on
a
chest
of
tea
and
a
bag
of
coffee
so
they
decided
to
give
the
invitations
to
all
it
might
be
a
stormy
evening
and
some
would
be
prevented
the
lady
from
philadelphia
and
her
daughters
accepted
and
it
turned
out
a
fair
day
and
more
came
than
were
expected
ann
maria
bromwick
had
a
friend
staying
with
her
and
brought
her
over
for
the
bromwicks
were
opposite
neighbors
and
the
tremletts
had
a
niece
and
mary
osborne
an
aunt
that
they
took
the
liberty
to
bring
the
little
boys
were
at
the
door
to
show
in
the
guests
and
as
each
set
came
to
the
front
gate
they
ran
back
to
tell
their
mother
that
more
were
coming
peterkin
had
grown
dizzy
with
counting
those
who
had
come
and
trying
to
calculate
how
many
were
to
come
and
wondering
why
there
were
always
more
and
never
less
and
whether
the
cups
would
go
round
the
three
tremletts
all
came
with
their
niece
they
all
had
had
their
headaches
the
day
before
and
were
having
that
banged
feeling
you
always
have
after
a
headache
so
they
all
sat
at
the
same
side
of
the
room
on
the
long
sofa
all
the
jefferses
came
though
they
had
sent
uncertain
answers
old
jeffers
had
to
be
helped
in
with
his
cane
by
peterkin
the
gibbons
boys
came
and
would
stand
just
outside
the
parlor
door
and
juliana
appeared
afterward
with
the
two
other
sisters
unexpectedly
home
from
the
west
got
home
this
morning
they
said
and
so
glad
to
be
in
time
to
see
everybody
a
little
tired
to
be
sure
after
hours
in
a
repeated
peterkin
and
wondered
if
there
were
people
and
why
they
were
all
so
glad
to
come
and
whether
all
could
sit
down
old
and
bromwick
came
they
thought
it
would
not
be
neighborly
to
stay
away
they
insisted
on
getting
into
the
most
uncomfortable
seats
yet
there
seemed
to
be
seats
enough
while
the
gibbons
boys
preferred
to
stand
but
they
never
could
sit
round
a
elizabeth
eliza
had
thought
they
all
might
have
room
at
the
table
and
solomon
john
and
the
little
boys
could
help
in
the
waiting
it
was
a
great
moment
when
the
lady
from
philadelphia
arrived
with
her
daughters
peterkin
was
talking
to
bromwick
who
was
a
little
deaf
the
gibbons
boys
retreated
a
little
farther
behind
the
parlor
door
peterkin
hastened
forward
to
shake
hands
with
the
lady
from
philadelphia
saying
four
gibbons
girls
and
mary
osborne
s
aunt
that
makes
nineteen
and
now
it
made
no
difference
what
she
said
for
there
was
such
a
murmuring
of
talk
that
any
words
suited
and
the
lady
from
philadelphia
wanted
to
be
introduced
to
the
bromwicks
it
was
delightful
for
the
little
boys
they
came
to
elizabeth
eliza
and
asked
can
t
we
go
and
ask
more
can
t
we
fetch
the
larkins
oh
dear
no
answered
elizabeth
eliza
i
can
t
even
count
peterkin
found
time
to
meet
elizabeth
eliza
in
the
side
entry
to
ask
if
there
were
going
to
be
cups
enough
i
have
set
agamemnon
in
the
front
entry
to
count
said
elizabeth
eliza
putting
her
hand
to
her
head
the
little
boys
came
to
say
that
the
maberlys
were
coming
the
maberlys
exclaimed
elizabeth
eliza
i
never
asked
it
is
your
father
s
doing
cried
peterkin
i
do
believe
he
asked
everybody
he
saw
and
she
hurried
back
to
her
guests
what
if
father
really
has
asked
everybody
elizabeth
eliza
said
to
herself
pressing
her
head
again
with
her
hand
there
were
the
cow
and
the
pig
but
if
they
all
took
tea
or
coffee
or
both
the
cups
could
not
go
round
agamemnon
returned
in
the
midst
of
her
agony
he
had
not
been
able
to
count
the
guests
they
moved
about
so
they
talked
so
and
it
would
not
look
well
to
appear
to
count
what
shall
we
do
exclaimed
elizabeth
eliza
we
are
not
a
family
for
an
emergency
said
agamemnon
what
do
you
suppose
they
did
in
philadelphia
at
the
exhibition
when
there
were
more
people
than
cups
and
saucers
asked
elizabeth
eliza
could
not
you
go
and
inquire
i
know
the
lady
from
philadelphia
is
talking
about
the
exhibition
and
telling
how
she
stayed
at
home
to
receive
friends
and
they
must
have
had
trouble
there
could
not
you
go
in
and
ask
just
as
if
you
wanted
to
know
agamemnon
looked
into
the
room
but
there
were
too
many
talking
with
the
lady
from
philadelphia
if
we
could
only
look
into
some
book
he
said
the
encyclopaedia
or
the
dictionary
they
are
such
a
help
sometimes
at
this
moment
he
thought
of
his
great
triumphs
of
great
men
that
he
was
reading
just
now
he
had
not
reached
the
lives
of
the
stephensons
or
any
of
the
men
of
modern
times
he
might
skip
over
to
them
he
knew
they
were
men
for
emergencies
he
ran
up
to
his
room
and
met
solomon
john
coming
down
with
chairs
that
is
a
good
thought
said
agamemnon
i
will
bring
down
more
upstairs
no
said
solomon
john
here
are
all
that
can
come
down
the
rest
of
the
bedroom
chairs
match
bureaus
and
they
never
will
do
agamemnon
kept
on
to
his
own
room
to
consult
his
books
if
only
he
could
invent
something
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
a
set
of
bedroom
furniture
that
in
an
emergency
could
be
turned
into
parlor
chairs
it
seemed
an
idea
and
he
sat
himself
down
to
his
table
and
pencils
when
he
was
interrupted
by
the
little
boys
who
came
to
tell
him
that
elizabeth
eliza
wanted
him
the
little
boys
had
been
busy
thinking
they
proposed
that
the
with
all
the
things
on
should
be
pushed
into
the
front
room
where
the
company
were
and
those
could
take
cups
who
could
find
cups
but
elizabeth
eliza
feared
it
would
not
be
safe
to
push
so
large
a
table
it
might
upset
and
break
what
china
they
had
agamemnon
came
down
to
find
her
pouring
out
tea
in
the
back
room
she
called
to
him
agamemnon
you
must
bring
mary
osborne
to
help
and
perhaps
one
of
the
gibbons
boys
would
carry
round
some
of
the
and
so
she
began
to
pour
out
and
to
send
round
the
sandwiches
and
the
tea
and
the
coffee
let
things
go
as
far
as
they
would
the
little
boys
took
the
sugar
and
cream
as
soon
as
they
have
done
drinking
bring
back
the
cups
and
saucers
to
be
washed
she
said
to
the
gibbons
boys
and
the
little
boys
this
was
an
idea
of
mary
osborne
s
but
what
was
their
surprise
that
the
more
they
poured
out
the
more
cups
they
seemed
to
have
elizabeth
eliza
took
the
coffee
and
mary
osborne
the
tea
amanda
brought
fresh
cups
from
the
kitchen
i
can
t
understand
it
elizabeth
eliza
said
to
amanda
do
they
come
back
to
you
round
through
the
piazza
surely
there
are
more
cups
than
there
were
her
surprise
was
greater
when
some
of
them
proved
to
be
that
matched
the
set
and
they
never
had
had
solomon
john
came
in
at
this
moment
breathless
with
triumph
solomon
john
elizabeth
eliza
exclaimed
i
can
not
understand
the
cups
it
is
my
doing
said
solomon
john
with
an
elevated
air
i
went
to
the
lady
from
philadelphia
in
the
midst
of
her
talk
what
do
you
do
in
philadelphia
when
you
haven
t
enough
cups
borrow
of
my
neighbors
she
answered
as
quick
as
she
she
must
have
guessed
interrupted
elizabeth
eliza
that
may
be
said
solomon
john
but
i
whispered
to
ann
maria
bromwick
she
was
standing
by
and
she
took
me
straight
over
into
their
closet
and
old
bromwick
bought
this
set
just
where
we
bought
ours
and
they
had
a
too
you
mean
where
our
father
and
mother
bought
them
we
were
not
born
said
elizabeth
eliza
it
is
all
the
same
said
solomon
john
they
match
so
they
did
and
more
and
more
came
in
elizabeth
eliza
exclaimed
and
agamemnon
says
we
are
not
a
family
for
emergencies
ann
maria
was
very
good
about
it
said
solomon
john
and
quick
too
and
old
bromwick
has
kept
all
her
set
of
two
dozen
coffee
and
tea
cups
elizabeth
eliza
was
ready
to
faint
with
delight
and
relief
she
told
the
gibbons
boys
by
mistake
instead
of
agamemnon
and
the
little
boys
she
almost
let
fall
the
cups
and
saucers
she
took
in
her
hand
no
trouble
now
she
thought
of
the
cow
and
she
thought
of
the
pig
and
she
poured
on
no
trouble
except
about
the
chairs
she
looked
into
the
room
all
seemed
to
be
sitting
down
even
her
mother
no
her
father
was
standing
talking
to
jeffers
but
he
was
drinking
coffee
and
the
gibbons
boys
were
handing
things
around
the
daughters
of
the
lady
from
philadelphia
were
sitting
on
shawls
on
the
edge
of
the
window
that
opened
upon
the
piazza
it
was
a
soft
warm
evening
and
some
of
the
young
people
were
on
the
piazza
everybody
was
talking
and
laughing
except
those
who
were
listening
peterkin
broke
away
to
bring
back
his
cup
and
another
for
more
coffee
it
s
a
great
success
elizabeth
eliza
he
whispered
the
coffee
is
admirable
and
plenty
of
cups
we
asked
none
too
many
i
should
not
mind
having
a
every
elizabeth
eliza
sighed
with
relief
as
she
filled
his
cup
it
was
going
off
well
there
were
cups
enough
but
she
was
not
sure
she
could
live
over
another
such
hour
of
anxiety
and
what
was
to
be
done
after
tea

peterkins

our
best

you
miss
the
train

t
you

my
mrs

with
the
train
you
don
t
mean
you
walked
mrs
o
no
indeed
elizabeth
we
came
in
a
horse
and
carryall
i
always
wondered
how
anybody
could
come
in
a
horse
you
are
too
foolish
julia
they
came
in
the
carryall
part
but
didn
t
you
start
in
time
mrs
it
all
comes
from
the
carryall
being
so
hard
to
turn
i
told
peterkin
we
should
get
into
trouble
with
one
of
those
carryalls
that
don
t
turn
easy
elizabeth
they
turn
easy
enough
in
the
stable
so
you
can
t
tell
mrs
yes
we
started
with
the
little
boys
and
solomon
john
on
the
back
seat
and
elizabeth
eliza
on
the
front
she
was
to
drive
and
i
was
to
see
to
the
driving
but
the
horse
was
not
faced
toward
boston
and
you
tipped
over
in
turning
round
oh
what
an
accident
and
the
little
boys
where
are
they
are
they
killed
elizabeth
the
little
boys
are
all
safe
we
left
them
at
the
pringles
with
solomon
john
but
what
did
happen
mrs
we
started
the
wrong
way
you
lost
your
way
after
all
elizabeth
no
we
knew
the
way
well
enough
it
s
as
plain
as
a
pikestaff
mrs
no
we
had
the
horse
faced
in
the
wrong
direction
toward
providence
elizabeth
and
mother
was
afraid
to
have
me
turn
and
we
kept
on
and
on
till
we
should
reach
a
wide
place
mrs
i
thought
we
should
come
to
a
road
that
would
veer
off
to
the
right
or
left
and
bring
us
back
to
the
right
direction
could
not
you
all
get
out
and
turn
the
thing
round
mrs
why
no
if
it
had
broken
down
we
should
not
have
been
in
anything
and
could
not
have
gone
anywhere
elizabeth
yes
i
have
always
heard
it
was
best
to
stay
in
the
carriage
whatever
happens
but
nothing
seemed
to
happen
mrs
o
yes
we
met
one
man
after
another
and
we
asked
the
way
to
boston
elizabeth
and
all
they
would
say
was
turn
right
round
you
are
on
the
road
to
mrs
as
if
we
could
turn
right
round
that
was
just
what
we
couldn
t
you
don
t
mean
you
kept
on
all
the
way
to
providence
elizabeth
o
dear
no
we
kept
on
and
on
till
we
met
a
man
with
a
black
black
leather
i
should
say
he
must
have
been
a
mrs
i
dare
say
he
was
his
bag
seemed
heavy
he
set
it
on
a
stone
i
dare
say
it
was
the
same
one
that
came
here
the
other
day
he
wanted
me
to
buy
the
history
of
the
aborigines
brought
up
from
earliest
times
to
the
present
date
in
four
volumes
i
told
him
i
hadn
t
time
to
read
so
much
he
said
that
was
no
matter
few
did
and
it
wasn
t
much
worth
it
they
bought
books
for
the
look
of
the
thing
now
that
was
illiterate
he
never
could
have
graduated
i
hope
elizabeth
eliza
you
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
man
elizabeth
very
likely
it
was
not
the
same
one
did
he
have
a
kind
of
suit
with
one
of
the
buttons
worn
mrs
i
noticed
one
of
the
buttons
was
off
we
re
off
the
subject
did
you
buy
his
book
elizabeth
he
never
offered
us
his
book
mrs
he
told
us
the
same
story
we
were
going
to
providence
if
we
wanted
to
go
to
boston
we
must
turn
directly
round
elizabeth
i
told
him
i
couldn
t
but
he
took
the
horse
s
head
and
the
first
thing
i
knew
he
had
yanked
you
round
mrs
i
screamed
i
couldn
t
help
it
elizabeth
i
was
glad
when
it
was
over
well
well
it
shows
the
disadvantage
of
starting
wrong
mrs
yes
we
came
straight
enough
when
the
horse
was
headed
right
but
we
lost
time
elizabeth
i
am
sorry
enough
i
lost
the
exhibition
and
seeing
you
take
the
diploma
amanda
i
never
got
the
diploma
myself
i
came
near
it
mrs
somehow
elizabeth
eliza
never
succeeded
i
think
there
was
partiality
about
the
promotions
elizabeth
i
never
was
good
about
remembering
things
i
studied
well
enough
but
when
i
came
to
say
off
my
lesson
i
couldn
t
think
what
it
was
yet
i
could
have
answered
some
of
the
other
girls
questions
it
s
odd
how
the
other
girls
always
have
the
easiest
questions
elizabeth
i
never
could
remember
poetry
there
was
only
one
thing
i
could
repeat
oh
do
let
us
have
it
now
and
then
we
ll
recite
to
you
some
of
our
exhibition
pieces
elizabeth
i
ll
try
mrs
yes
elizabeth
eliza
do
what
you
can
to
help
entertain
amanda
s
friends
all
stand
looking
at
elizabeth
eliza
who
remains
silent
and
thoughtful
elizabeth
i
m
trying
to
think
what
it
is
about
you
all
know
it
you
remember
amanda
the
name
is
rather
long
it
can
t
be
nebuchadnezzar
can
it
that
is
one
of
the
longest
names
i
know
elizabeth
o
dear
no
perhaps
it
s
cleopatra
elizabeth
it
does
begin
with
a
c
only
he
was
a
boy
that
s
a
pity
for
it
might
be
we
are
seven
only
that
is
a
girl
some
of
them
were
boys
elizabeth
it
begins
about
a
boy
if
i
could
only
think
where
he
was
i
can
t
remember
perhaps
he
stood
upon
the
burning
deck
elizabeth
that
s
just
it
i
knew
he
stood
somewhere
casablanca
now
begin
go
ahead
elizabeth
the
boy
stood
on
the
burning
deck
when
when
i
can
t
think
who
stood
there
with
him
if
the
deck
was
burning
it
must
have
been
on
fire
i
guess
the
rest
ran
away
or
jumped
into
boats
that
s
just
it
whence
all
but
him
had
elizabeth
i
think
i
can
say
it
now
the
boy
stood
on
the
burning
deck
whence
all
but
him
had
fled
she
hesitates
then
i
think
he
went
of
course
he
fled
after
the
rest
dear
no
that
s
the
point
he
didn
t
the
flames
rolled
on
he
would
not
go
without
his
father
s
elizabeth
o
yes
now
i
can
say
it
the
boy
stood
on
the
burning
deck
whence
all
but
him
had
fled
the
flames
rolled
on
he
would
not
go
without
his
father
s
but
it
used
to
rhyme
i
don
t
know
what
has
happened
to
it
mrs
elizabeth
eliza
is
very
particular
about
the
rhymes
elizabeth
it
must
be
without
his
father
s
head
or
perhaps
without
his
father
said
he
should
i
think
you
must
have
omitted
something
she
has
left
out
ever
so
much
perhaps
it
s
as
well
to
omit
some
for
the
has
come
and
you
must
all
come
down
and
here
are
the
rest
of
the
girls
and
let
us
all
unite
in
a
song
exeunt
omnes
singing
the
peterkins
celebrate
the
fourth
of
july
the
day
began
early
a
compact
had
been
made
with
the
little
boys
the
evening
before
they
were
to
be
allowed
to
usher
in
the
glorious
day
by
the
blowing
of
horns
exactly
at
sunrise
but
they
were
to
blow
them
for
precisely
five
minutes
only
and
no
sound
of
the
horns
should
be
heard
afterward
till
the
family
were
downstairs
it
was
thought
that
a
peace
might
thus
be
bought
by
a
short
though
crowded
period
of
noise
the
morning
came
even
before
the
morning
at
three
o
clock
a
terrible
blast
of
the
horns
aroused
the
whole
family
peterkin
clasped
her
hands
to
her
head
and
exclaimed
i
am
thankful
the
lady
from
philadelphia
is
not
here
for
she
had
been
invited
to
stay
a
week
but
had
declined
to
come
before
the
fourth
of
july
as
she
was
not
well
and
her
doctor
had
prescribed
quiet
and
the
number
of
the
horns
was
most
remarkable
it
was
as
though
every
cow
in
the
place
had
arisen
and
was
blowing
through
both
her
own
horns
how
many
little
boys
are
there
how
many
have
we
exclaimed
peterkin
going
over
their
names
one
by
one
mechanically
thinking
he
would
do
it
as
he
might
count
imaginary
sheep
jumping
over
a
fence
to
put
himself
to
sleep
alas
the
counting
could
not
put
him
to
sleep
now
in
such
a
din
and
how
unexpectedly
long
the
five
minutes
seemed
elizabeth
eliza
was
to
take
out
her
watch
and
give
the
signal
for
the
end
of
the
five
minutes
and
the
ceasing
of
the
horns
why
did
not
the
signal
come
why
did
not
elizabeth
eliza
stop
them
and
certainly
it
was
long
before
sunrise
there
was
no
dawn
to
be
seen
we
will
not
try
this
plan
again
said
peterkin
if
we
live
to
another
fourth
added
peterkin
hastening
to
the
door
to
inquire
into
the
state
of
affairs
alas
amanda
by
mistake
had
waked
up
the
little
boys
an
hour
too
early
and
by
another
mistake
the
little
boys
had
invited
three
or
four
of
their
friends
to
spend
the
night
with
them
peterkin
had
given
them
permission
to
have
the
boys
for
the
whole
day
and
they
understood
the
day
as
beginning
when
they
went
to
bed
the
night
before
this
accounted
for
the
number
of
horns
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
hear
any
explanation
but
the
five
minutes
were
over
and
the
horns
had
ceased
and
there
remained
only
the
noise
of
a
singular
leaping
of
feet
explained
perhaps
by
a
possible
that
kept
the
family
below
partially
awake
until
the
bells
and
cannon
made
known
the
dawning
of
the
glorious
day
the
sunrise
or
the
rising
of
the
sons
as
peterkin
jocosely
called
it
when
they
heard
the
little
boys
and
their
friends
clattering
down
the
stairs
to
begin
the
outside
festivities
they
were
bound
first
for
the
swamp
for
elizabeth
eliza
at
the
suggestion
of
the
lady
from
philadelphia
had
advised
them
to
hang
some
flags
around
the
pillars
of
the
piazza
now
the
little
boys
knew
of
a
place
in
the
swamp
where
they
had
been
in
the
habit
of
digging
for
and
where
they
might
find
plenty
of
flag
flowers
they
did
bring
away
all
they
could
but
they
were
a
little
out
of
bloom
the
boys
were
in
the
midst
of
nailing
up
all
they
had
on
the
pillars
of
the
piazza
when
the
procession
of
the
antiques
and
horribles
passed
along
as
the
procession
saw
the
festive
arrangements
on
the
piazza
and
the
crowd
of
boys
who
cheered
them
loudly
it
stopped
to
salute
the
house
with
some
especial
strains
of
greeting
poor
peterkin
they
were
directly
under
her
windows
in
a
few
moments
of
quiet
during
the
boys
absence
from
the
house
on
their
visit
to
the
swamp
she
had
been
trying
to
find
out
whether
she
had
a
or
whether
it
was
all
the
noise
and
she
was
just
deciding
it
was
the
sick
headache
but
was
falling
into
a
light
slumber
when
the
fresh
noise
outside
began
there
were
the
imitations
of
the
crowing
of
cocks
and
braying
of
donkeys
and
the
sound
of
horns
encored
and
increased
by
the
cheers
of
the
boys
then
began
the
torpedoes
and
the
antiques
and
horribles
had
chinese
crackers
also
and
in
despair
of
sleep
the
family
came
down
to
breakfast
peterkin
had
always
been
much
afraid
of
and
had
never
allowed
the
boys
to
bring
gunpowder
into
the
house
she
was
even
afraid
of
torpedoes
they
looked
so
much
like
she
was
sure
some
the
children
would
swallow
them
and
explode
before
anybody
knew
it
she
was
very
timid
about
other
things
she
was
not
sure
even
about
everybody
exclaimed
over
this
surely
there
was
no
danger
in
but
peterkin
declared
she
had
been
very
much
alarmed
at
the
centennial
exhibition
and
in
the
crowded
corners
of
the
streets
in
boston
at
the
stands
where
they
had
machines
to
roast
the
she
did
not
think
it
was
safe
they
might
go
off
any
time
in
the
midst
of
a
crowd
of
people
too
peterkin
thought
there
actually
was
no
danger
and
he
should
be
sorry
to
give
up
the
he
thought
it
an
american
institution
something
really
belonging
to
the
fourth
of
july
he
even
confessed
to
a
quiet
pleasure
in
crushing
the
empty
shells
with
his
feet
on
the
sidewalks
as
he
went
along
the
streets
agamemnon
thought
it
a
simple
joy
in
consideration
however
of
the
fact
that
they
had
had
no
real
celebration
of
the
fourth
the
last
year
peterkin
had
consented
to
give
over
the
day
this
year
to
the
amusement
of
the
family
as
a
centennial
celebration
she
would
prepare
herself
for
a
terrible
noise
only
she
did
not
want
any
gunpowder
brought
into
the
house
the
little
boys
had
begun
by
firing
some
torpedoes
a
few
days
beforehand
that
their
mother
might
be
used
to
the
sound
and
had
selected
their
horns
some
weeks
before
solomon
john
had
been
very
busy
in
inventing
some
fireworks
as
peterkin
objected
to
the
use
of
gunpowder
he
found
out
from
the
dictionary
what
the
different
parts
of
gunpowder
are
saltpetre
charcoal
and
sulphur
charcoal
he
discovered
they
had
in
the
saltpetre
they
would
find
in
the
cellar
in
the
beef
barrel
and
sulphur
they
could
buy
at
the
apothecary
s
he
explained
to
his
mother
that
these
materials
had
never
yet
exploded
in
the
house
and
she
was
quieted
agamemnon
meanwhile
remembered
a
recipe
he
had
read
somewhere
for
making
a
fulminating
paste
of
and
powder
of
brimstone
he
had
written
it
down
on
a
piece
of
paper
in
his
but
the
iron
filings
must
be
finely
powdered
this
they
began
upon
a
day
or
two
before
and
the
very
afternoon
before
laid
out
some
of
the
paste
on
the
piazza
and
rockets
were
contributed
by
peterkin
for
the
evening
according
to
a
programme
drawn
up
by
agamemnon
and
solomon
john
the
reading
of
the
declaration
of
independence
was
to
take
place
in
the
morning
on
the
piazza
under
the
flags
the
bromwicks
brought
over
their
flag
to
hang
over
the
door
that
is
what
the
lady
from
philadelphia
meant
explained
elizabeth
eliza
she
said
the
flags
of
our
country
said
the
little
boys
we
thought
she
meant
in
the
quite
a
company
assembled
but
it
seemed
nobody
had
a
copy
of
the
declaration
of
independence
elizabeth
eliza
said
she
could
say
one
line
if
they
each
could
add
as
much
but
it
proved
they
all
knew
the
same
line
that
she
did
as
they
began
when
in
the
course
of
when
in
the
course
of
when
in
the
course
of
human
when
in
the
course
of
human
events
when
in
the
course
of
human
events
it
becomes
when
in
the
course
of
human
events
it
becomes
necessary
when
in
the
course
of
human
events
it
becomes
necessary
for
one
people
they
could
not
get
any
farther
some
of
the
party
decided
that
one
people
was
a
good
place
to
stop
and
the
little
boys
sent
off
some
fresh
torpedoes
in
honor
of
the
people
but
peterkin
was
not
satisfied
he
invited
the
assembled
party
to
stay
until
sunset
and
meanwhile
he
would
find
a
copy
and
torpedoes
were
to
be
saved
to
be
fired
off
at
the
close
of
every
sentence
and
now
the
noon
bells
rang
and
the
noon
bells
ceased
peterkin
wanted
to
ask
everybody
to
dinner
she
should
have
some
cold
beef
she
had
let
amanda
go
because
it
was
the
fourth
and
everybody
ought
to
be
free
that
one
day
so
she
could
not
have
much
of
a
dinner
but
when
she
went
to
cut
her
beef
she
found
solomon
had
taken
it
to
soak
on
account
of
the
saltpetre
for
the
fireworks
well
they
had
a
pig
so
she
took
a
ham
and
the
boys
had
bought
tamarinds
and
buns
and
a
so
the
company
stayed
on
and
when
the
antiques
and
horribles
passed
again
they
were
treated
to
and
lemonade
they
sung
patriotic
songs
they
told
stories
they
fired
torpedoes
they
frightened
the
cats
with
them
it
was
a
warm
afternoon
the
red
poppies
were
out
wide
and
the
hot
sun
poured
down
on
the
in
the
garden
there
was
a
seething
sound
of
a
hot
day
in
the
buzzing
of
insects
in
the
steaming
heat
that
came
up
from
the
ground
some
neighboring
boys
were
firing
a
toy
cannon
every
time
it
went
off
peterkin
started
and
looked
to
see
if
one
of
the
little
boys
was
gone
peterkin
had
set
out
to
find
a
copy
of
the
agamemnon
had
disappeared
she
had
not
a
moment
to
decide
about
her
headache
she
asked
ann
maria
if
she
were
not
anxious
about
the
fireworks
and
if
rockets
were
not
dangerous
they
went
up
but
you
were
never
sure
where
they
came
down
and
then
came
a
fresh
tumult
all
the
in
town
rushed
toward
them
clanging
with
bells
men
and
boys
yelling
they
were
out
for
a
practice
and
for
a
show
peterkin
thought
the
house
was
on
fire
and
so
did
some
of
the
guests
there
was
great
rushing
hither
and
thither
some
thought
they
would
better
go
home
some
thought
they
would
better
stay
peterkin
hastened
into
the
house
to
save
herself
or
see
what
she
could
save
elizabeth
eliza
followed
her
first
proceeding
to
collect
all
the
pokers
and
tongs
she
could
find
because
they
could
be
thrown
out
of
the
window
without
breaking
she
had
read
of
people
who
had
flung
out
of
the
window
by
mistake
in
the
excitement
of
the
house
being
on
fire
and
had
carried
the
pokers
and
tongs
carefully
into
the
garden
there
was
nothing
like
being
prepared
she
had
always
determined
to
do
the
reverse
so
with
calmness
she
told
solomon
john
to
take
down
the
but
she
met
with
a
difficulty
there
were
no
pokers
and
tongs
as
they
did
not
use
them
they
had
no
open
fires
peterkin
had
been
afraid
of
them
so
elizabeth
eliza
took
all
the
pots
and
kettles
up
to
the
upper
windows
ready
to
be
thrown
out
but
where
was
peterkin
solomon
john
found
she
had
fled
to
the
attic
in
terror
he
persuaded
her
to
come
down
assuring
her
it
was
the
most
unsafe
place
but
she
insisted
upon
stopping
to
collect
some
bags
of
old
pieces
that
nobody
would
think
of
saving
from
the
general
wreck
she
said
unless
she
did
alas
this
was
the
result
of
fireworks
on
fourth
of
july
as
they
came
downstairs
they
heard
the
voices
of
all
the
company
declaring
there
was
no
fire
the
danger
was
past
it
was
long
before
peterkin
could
believe
it
they
told
her
the
fire
company
was
only
out
for
show
and
to
celebrate
the
fourth
of
july
she
thought
it
already
too
much
celebrated
elizabeth
eliza
s
kettles
and
pans
had
come
down
through
the
windows
with
a
crash
that
had
only
added
to
the
festivities
the
little
boys
thought
peterkin
had
been
roaming
about
all
this
time
in
search
of
a
copy
of
the
declaration
of
independence
the
public
library
was
shut
and
he
had
to
go
from
house
to
house
but
now
as
the
sunset
bells
and
cannon
began
he
returned
with
a
copy
and
read
it
to
the
pealing
of
the
bells
and
sounding
of
the
cannon
torpedoes
and
crackers
were
fired
at
every
pause
some
pots
tin
cans
filled
with
crackers
which
were
lighted
went
off
with
great
explosions
at
the
most
exciting
moment
near
the
close
of
the
reading
agamemnon
with
an
expression
of
terror
pulled
solomon
john
aside
i
have
suddenly
remembered
where
i
read
about
the
fulminating
paste
we
made
it
was
in
the
preface
to
woodstock
and
i
have
been
round
to
borrow
the
book
to
read
the
directions
over
again
because
i
was
afraid
about
the
paste
going
off
read
this
quickly
and
tell
me
where
is
the
fulminating
paste
solomon
john
was
busy
winding
some
covers
of
paper
over
a
little
parcel
it
contained
chlorate
of
potash
and
sulphur
mixed
a
friend
had
told
him
of
the
composition
the
more
thicknesses
of
paper
you
put
round
it
the
louder
it
would
go
off
you
must
pound
it
with
a
hammer
solomon
john
felt
it
must
be
perfectly
safe
as
his
mother
had
taken
potash
for
a
medicine
he
still
held
the
parcel
as
he
read
from
agamemnon
s
book
this
paste
when
it
has
lain
together
about
hours
will
of
itself
take
fire
and
burn
all
the
sulphur
away
with
a
blue
flame
and
a
bad
where
is
the
paste
repeated
solomon
john
in
terror
we
made
it
just
hours
ago
said
agamemnon
we
put
it
on
the
piazza
exclaimed
solomon
john
rapidly
recalling
the
facts
and
it
is
in
front
of
our
mother
s
feet
he
hastened
to
snatch
the
paste
away
before
it
should
take
fire
flinging
aside
the
packet
in
his
hurry
agamemnon
jumping
upon
the
piazza
at
the
same
moment
trod
upon
the
paper
parcel
which
exploded
at
once
with
the
shock
and
he
fell
to
the
ground
while
at
the
same
moment
the
paste
fulminated
into
a
blue
flame
directly
in
front
of
peterkin
it
was
a
moment
of
great
confusion
there
were
cries
and
screams
the
bells
were
still
ringing
the
cannon
firing
and
peterkin
had
just
reached
the
closing
words
our
lives
our
fortunes
and
our
sacred
we
are
all
blown
up
as
i
feared
we
should
be
peterkin
at
length
ventured
to
say
finding
herself
in
a
by
the
side
of
the
piazza
she
scarcely
dared
to
open
her
eyes
to
see
the
scattered
limbs
about
her
it
was
so
with
all
even
ann
maria
bromwick
clutched
a
pillar
of
the
piazza
with
closed
eyes
at
length
peterkin
said
calmly
is
anybody
killed
there
was
no
reply
nobody
could
tell
whether
it
was
because
everybody
was
killed
or
because
they
were
too
wounded
to
answer
it
was
a
great
while
before
peterkin
ventured
to
move
but
the
little
boys
soon
shouted
with
joy
and
cheered
the
success
of
solomon
john
s
fireworks
and
hoped
he
had
some
more
one
of
them
had
his
face
blackened
by
an
unexpected
cracker
and
elizabeth
eliza
s
muslin
dress
was
burned
here
and
there
but
no
one
was
hurt
no
one
had
lost
any
limbs
though
peterkin
was
sure
she
had
seen
some
flying
in
the
air
nobody
could
understand
how
as
she
had
kept
her
eyes
firmly
shut
no
greater
accident
had
occurred
than
the
singeing
of
the
tip
of
solomon
john
s
nose
but
there
was
an
unpleasant
and
terrible
odor
from
the
fulminating
peterkin
was
extricated
from
the
no
one
knew
how
she
got
there
indeed
the
thundering
noise
had
stunned
everybody
it
had
roused
the
neighborhood
even
more
than
before
answering
explosions
came
on
every
side
and
though
the
sunset
light
had
not
faded
away
the
little
boys
hastened
to
send
off
rockets
under
cover
of
the
confusion
solomon
john
s
other
fireworks
would
not
go
but
all
felt
he
had
done
enough
peterkin
retreated
into
the
parlor
deciding
she
really
did
have
a
headache
at
times
she
had
to
come
out
when
a
rocket
went
off
to
see
if
it
was
one
of
the
little
boys
she
was
exhausted
by
the
adventures
of
the
day
and
almost
thought
it
could
not
have
been
worse
if
the
boys
had
been
allowed
gunpowder
the
distracted
lady
was
thankful
there
was
likely
to
be
but
one
centennial
fourth
in
her
lifetime
and
declared
she
should
never
more
keep
anything
in
the
house
as
dangerous
as
saltpetred
beef
and
she
should
never
venture
to
take
another
spoonful
of
potash
the
peterkins
picnic
there
was
some
doubt
about
the
weather
solomon
john
looked
at
the
probabilities
there
were
to
be
areas
of
rain
in
the
new
england
states
agamemnon
thought
if
they
could
only
know
where
the
areas
of
rain
were
to
be
they
might
go
to
the
others
peterkin
proposed
walking
round
the
house
in
a
procession
to
examine
the
sky
as
they
returned
they
met
ann
maria
bromwick
who
was
to
go
much
surprised
not
to
find
them
ready
and
peterkin
were
to
go
in
the
carryall
and
take
up
the
lady
from
philadelphia
and
ann
maria
with
the
rest
was
to
follow
in
a
wagon
and
to
stop
for
the
daughters
of
the
lady
from
philadelphia
the
wagon
arrived
and
so
peterkin
had
the
horse
put
into
the
carryall
a
basket
had
been
kept
on
the
back
piazza
for
some
days
where
anybody
could
put
anything
that
would
be
needed
for
the
picnic
as
soon
as
it
was
thought
of
agamemnon
had
already
decided
to
take
a
thermometer
somebody
was
always
complaining
of
being
too
hot
or
too
cold
at
a
picnic
and
it
would
be
a
great
convenience
to
see
if
she
really
were
so
he
thought
now
he
might
take
a
barometer
as
probabilities
was
so
uncertain
then
if
it
went
down
in
a
threatening
way
they
could
all
come
back
the
little
boys
had
tied
their
kites
to
the
basket
they
had
never
tried
them
at
home
it
might
be
a
good
chance
on
the
hills
solomon
john
had
put
in
some
elizabeth
eliza
a
book
of
poetry
peterkin
did
not
like
sitting
on
the
ground
and
proposed
taking
two
chairs
one
for
himself
and
one
for
anybody
else
the
little
boys
were
perfectly
happy
they
jumped
in
and
out
of
the
wagon
a
dozen
times
with
new
boots
bought
for
the
occasion
before
they
started
peterkin
began
to
think
she
had
already
had
enough
of
the
picnic
what
with
going
and
coming
and
trying
to
remember
things
so
many
mistakes
were
made
the
things
that
were
to
go
in
the
wagon
were
put
in
the
carryall
and
the
things
in
the
carryall
had
to
be
taken
out
for
the
wagon
elizabeth
eliza
forgot
her
and
had
to
go
back
for
her
veil
and
peterkin
came
near
forgetting
his
umbrella
peterkin
sat
on
the
piazza
and
tried
to
think
she
felt
as
if
she
must
have
forgotten
something
she
knew
she
must
why
could
not
she
think
of
it
now
before
it
was
too
late
it
seems
hard
any
day
to
think
what
to
have
for
dinner
but
how
much
easier
now
it
would
be
to
stay
at
home
quietly
and
order
the
dinner
and
there
was
the
butcher
s
cart
but
now
they
must
think
of
everything
at
last
she
was
put
into
the
carryall
and
peterkin
in
front
to
drive
twice
they
started
and
twice
they
found
something
was
left
behind
the
loaf
of
fresh
brown
bread
on
the
back
piazza
and
a
basket
of
sandwiches
on
the
front
porch
and
just
as
the
wagon
was
leaving
the
little
boys
shrieked
the
basket
of
things
was
left
behind
everybody
got
out
of
the
wagon
agamemnon
went
back
into
the
house
to
see
if
anything
else
were
left
he
looked
into
the
closets
he
shut
the
front
door
and
was
so
busy
that
he
forgot
to
get
into
the
wagon
himself
it
started
off
and
went
down
the
street
without
him
he
was
wondering
what
he
should
do
if
he
were
left
behind
why
had
they
not
thought
to
arrange
a
telegraph
wire
to
the
back
wheel
of
the
wagon
so
that
he
might
have
sent
a
message
in
such
a
case
when
the
bromwicks
drove
out
of
their
yard
in
their
buggy
and
took
him
in
they
joined
the
rest
of
the
party
at
tatham
corners
where
they
were
all
to
meet
and
consult
where
they
were
to
go
peterkin
called
to
agamemnon
as
soon
as
he
appeared
she
had
been
holding
the
barometer
and
the
thermometer
and
they
waggled
so
that
it
troubled
her
it
was
hard
keeping
the
thermometer
out
of
the
sun
which
would
make
it
so
warm
it
really
took
away
her
pleasure
holding
the
things
agamemnon
decided
to
get
into
the
carryall
on
the
seat
with
his
father
and
take
the
barometer
and
thermometer
the
consultation
went
on
should
they
go
to
cherry
swamp
or
lonetown
hill
you
had
the
view
if
you
went
to
lonetown
hill
but
maybe
the
drive
to
cherry
swamp
was
prettier
somebody
suggested
asking
the
lady
from
philadelphia
as
the
picnic
was
got
up
for
her
but
where
was
she
i
declare
said
peterkin
i
forgot
to
stop
for
her
the
whole
picnic
there
and
no
lady
from
philadelphia
it
seemed
the
horse
had
twitched
his
head
in
a
threatening
manner
as
they
passed
the
house
and
peterkin
had
forgotten
to
stop
and
peterkin
had
been
so
busy
managing
the
thermometers
that
she
had
not
noticed
and
the
wagon
had
followed
on
behind
peterkin
was
in
despair
she
knew
they
had
forgotten
something
she
did
not
like
to
have
peterkin
make
a
short
turn
and
it
was
getting
late
and
what
would
the
lady
from
philadelphia
think
of
it
and
had
they
not
better
give
it
all
up
but
everybody
said
no
and
peterkin
said
he
could
make
a
wide
turn
round
the
lovejoy
barn
so
they
made
the
turn
and
took
up
the
lady
from
philadelphia
and
the
wagon
followed
behind
and
took
up
their
daughters
for
there
was
a
driver
in
the
wagon
besides
solomon
john
ann
maria
bromwick
said
it
was
so
late
by
this
time
they
might
as
well
stop
and
have
the
picnic
on
the
common
but
the
question
was
put
again
where
should
they
go
the
lady
from
philadelphia
decided
for
strawberry
nook
it
sounded
inviting
there
were
no
strawberries
and
there
was
no
nook
it
was
said
but
there
was
a
good
place
to
tie
the
horses
peterkin
was
feeling
a
little
nervous
for
she
did
not
know
what
the
lady
from
philadelphia
would
think
of
their
having
forgotten
her
and
the
more
she
tried
to
explain
it
the
worse
it
seemed
to
make
it
she
supposed
they
never
did
such
things
in
philadelphia
she
knew
they
had
invited
all
the
world
to
a
party
but
she
was
sure
she
would
never
want
to
invite
anybody
again
there
was
no
fun
about
it
till
it
was
all
over
such
a
mistake
to
have
a
party
for
a
person
and
then
go
without
her
but
she
knew
they
would
forget
something
she
wished
they
had
not
called
it
their
picnic
there
was
another
bother
peterkin
stopped
was
anything
broke
exclaimed
peterkin
was
something
forgotten
asked
the
lady
from
philadelphia
no
but
peterkin
didn
t
know
the
way
and
here
he
was
leading
all
the
party
and
a
long
row
of
carriages
following
they
stopped
and
it
seemed
nobody
knew
the
way
to
strawberry
nook
unless
it
was
the
gibbons
boys
who
were
far
behind
they
were
made
to
drive
up
and
said
that
strawberry
nook
was
in
quite
a
different
direction
but
they
could
bring
the
party
round
to
it
through
the
meadows
the
lady
from
philadelphia
thought
they
might
stop
anywhere
such
a
pleasant
day
but
peterkin
said
they
were
started
for
strawberry
nook
and
had
better
keep
on
so
they
kept
on
it
proved
to
be
an
excellent
place
where
they
could
tie
the
horses
to
a
fence
peterkin
did
not
like
their
all
heading
different
ways
it
seemed
as
if
any
of
them
might
come
at
her
and
tear
up
the
fence
especially
as
the
little
boys
had
their
kites
flapping
round
the
tremletts
insisted
upon
the
whole
party
going
up
the
hill
it
was
too
damp
below
so
the
gibbons
boys
and
the
little
boys
and
agamemnon
and
solomon
john
and
all
the
party
had
to
carry
everything
up
to
the
rocks
the
large
basket
of
things
was
very
heavy
it
had
been
difficult
to
lift
it
into
the
wagon
and
it
was
harder
to
take
it
out
but
with
the
help
of
the
driver
and
peterkin
and
old
bromwick
it
was
got
up
the
hill
and
at
last
all
was
arranged
peterkin
was
seated
in
his
chair
the
other
was
offered
to
the
lady
from
philadelphia
but
she
preferred
the
carriage
cushions
so
did
old
bromwick
and
the
was
spread
for
they
did
bring
a
and
the
baskets
were
opened
and
the
picnic
really
began
the
pickles
had
tumbled
into
the
butter
and
the
spoons
had
been
forgotten
and
the
tremletts
basket
had
been
left
on
their
front
but
nobody
seemed
to
mind
everybody
was
hungry
and
everything
they
ate
seemed
of
the
best
the
little
boys
were
perfectly
happy
and
ate
of
all
the
kinds
of
cake
two
of
the
tremletts
would
stand
while
they
were
eating
because
they
were
afraid
of
the
ants
and
the
spiders
that
seemed
to
be
crawling
round
and
elizabeth
eliza
had
to
keep
poking
with
a
fern
leaf
to
drive
the
insects
out
of
the
plates
the
lady
from
philadelphia
was
made
comfortable
with
the
cushions
and
shawls
leaning
against
a
rock
peterkin
wondered
if
she
forgot
she
had
been
forgotten
john
osborne
said
it
was
time
for
conundrums
and
asked
why
is
a
pastoral
musical
play
better
than
the
music
we
have
here
because
one
is
a
grasshopper
and
the
other
is
a
elizabeth
eliza
said
she
knew
a
conundrum
a
very
funny
one
one
of
her
friends
in
boston
had
told
her
it
was
why
is
it
began
why
is
something
like
no
why
are
they
different
it
was
something
about
an
old
woman
or
else
it
was
something
about
a
young
one
it
was
very
funny
if
she
could
only
think
what
it
was
about
or
whether
it
was
alike
or
different
the
lady
from
philadelphia
was
proposing
they
should
guess
elizabeth
eliza
s
conundrum
first
the
question
and
then
the
answer
when
one
of
the
tremletts
came
running
down
the
hill
and
declared
she
had
just
discovered
a
very
threatening
cloud
and
she
was
sure
it
was
going
to
rain
down
directly
everybody
started
up
though
no
cloud
was
to
be
seen
there
was
a
great
looking
for
umbrellas
and
then
it
appeared
that
elizabeth
eliza
had
left
hers
after
all
though
she
had
gone
back
for
it
twice
peterkin
knew
he
had
not
forgotten
his
umbrella
because
he
had
put
the
whole
into
the
wagon
and
it
had
been
brought
up
the
hill
but
it
proved
to
hold
only
the
family
canes
there
was
a
great
cry
for
the
emergency
basket
that
had
not
been
opened
yet
peterkin
explained
how
for
days
the
family
had
been
putting
into
it
what
might
be
needed
as
soon
as
anything
was
thought
of
everybody
stopped
to
see
its
contents
it
was
carefully
covered
with
newspapers
first
came
out
a
that
would
be
useful
said
ann
maria
if
we
have
to
spend
the
afternoon
in
anybody
s
next
a
pair
of
andirons
what
were
they
for
in
case
of
needing
a
fire
in
the
woods
explained
solomon
john
then
came
a
volume
of
the
encyclopædia
but
it
was
the
first
volume
agamemnon
now
regretted
and
contained
only
a
and
a
part
of
b
and
nothing
about
rain
or
showers
next
a
bag
of
put
in
by
the
little
boys
and
elizabeth
eliza
s
book
of
poetry
and
a
change
of
boots
for
peterkin
a
small
in
case
the
ground
should
be
damp
some
of
the
little
boys
a
box
of
for
solomon
john
an
carefully
done
up
in
a
great
deal
of
newspaper
which
was
fortunate
as
the
ink
was
oozing
out
some
old
magazines
and
a
and
at
the
bottom
a
it
was
all
very
entertaining
and
there
seemed
to
be
something
for
every
occasion
but
the
present
old
bromwick
did
not
wonder
the
basket
was
so
heavy
it
was
all
so
interesting
that
nobody
but
the
tremletts
went
down
to
the
carriages
the
sun
was
shining
brighter
than
ever
and
ann
maria
insisted
on
setting
up
the
certainly
there
was
no
danger
of
a
shower
and
they
might
as
well
go
on
with
the
picnic
but
when
solomon
john
and
ann
maria
had
arranged
the
they
asked
everybody
to
look
at
their
watches
so
that
they
might
see
if
it
was
right
and
then
came
a
great
exclamation
at
the
hour
it
was
time
they
were
all
going
home
the
lady
from
philadelphia
had
been
wrapping
her
shawl
about
her
as
she
felt
the
sun
was
low
but
nobody
had
any
idea
it
was
so
late
well
they
had
left
late
and
went
back
a
great
many
times
had
stopped
sometimes
to
consult
and
had
been
long
on
the
road
and
it
had
taken
a
long
time
to
fetch
up
the
things
so
it
was
no
wonder
it
was
time
to
go
away
but
it
had
been
a
delightful
picnic
after
all
the
peterkins
charades
ever
since
the
picnic
the
peterkins
had
been
wanting
to
have
something
at
their
house
in
the
way
of
entertainment
the
little
boys
wanted
to
get
up
a
great
exposition
to
show
to
the
people
of
the
place
but
peterkin
thought
it
too
great
an
effort
to
send
to
foreign
countries
for
exhibits
and
it
was
given
up
there
was
however
a
new
needed
on
the
town
common
and
the
ladies
of
the
place
thought
it
ought
to
be
something
handsome
something
more
than
a
common
trough
and
they
ought
to
work
for
it
elizabeth
eliza
had
heard
at
philadelphia
how
much
women
had
done
and
she
felt
they
ought
to
contribute
to
such
a
cause
she
had
an
idea
but
she
would
not
speak
of
it
at
first
not
until
after
she
had
written
to
the
lady
from
philadelphia
she
had
often
thought
in
many
cases
if
they
had
asked
her
advice
first
they
might
have
saved
trouble
still
how
could
they
ask
advice
before
they
themselves
knew
what
they
wanted
it
was
very
easy
to
ask
advice
but
you
must
first
know
what
to
ask
about
and
again
elizabeth
eliza
felt
you
might
have
ideas
but
you
could
not
always
put
them
together
there
was
this
idea
of
the
and
then
this
idea
of
getting
some
money
for
it
so
she
began
with
writing
to
the
lady
from
philadelphia
the
little
boys
believed
she
spent
enough
for
it
in
before
it
all
came
out
but
it
did
come
out
at
last
that
the
peterkins
were
to
have
some
charades
at
their
own
house
for
the
benefit
of
the
needed
tickets
sold
only
to
especial
friends
ann
maria
bromwick
was
to
help
act
because
she
could
bring
some
old
bonnets
and
gowns
that
had
been
worn
by
an
aged
aunt
years
ago
and
which
they
had
always
kept
elizabeth
eliza
said
that
solomon
john
would
have
to
be
a
turk
and
they
must
borrow
all
the
red
things
and
cashmere
scarfs
in
the
place
she
knew
people
would
be
willing
to
lend
things
agamemnon
thought
you
ought
to
get
in
something
about
the
hindoos
they
were
such
an
odd
people
elizabeth
eliza
said
you
must
not
have
it
too
odd
or
people
would
not
understand
it
and
she
did
not
want
anything
to
frighten
her
mother
she
had
one
word
suggested
by
the
lady
from
philadelphia
in
her
letters
the
one
that
had
turk
in
it
but
they
ought
to
have
two
words
oh
yes
ann
maria
said
you
must
have
two
words
if
the
people
paid
for
their
tickets
they
would
want
to
get
their
money
s
solomon
john
thought
you
might
have
hindoos
the
little
boys
could
color
their
faces
brown
to
look
like
hindoos
you
could
have
the
first
scene
an
irishman
catching
a
hen
and
then
paying
the
for
dues
and
then
have
the
little
boys
for
hindoos
a
great
many
other
words
were
talked
of
but
nothing
seemed
to
suit
there
was
a
curtain
too
to
be
thought
of
because
the
stuck
when
you
tried
to
open
and
shut
them
agamemnon
said
that
the
had
a
curtain
they
would
probably
lend
john
osborne
and
so
it
was
decided
to
ask
john
osborne
to
help
if
they
had
a
curtain
they
ought
to
have
a
stage
solomon
john
said
he
was
sure
he
had
boards
and
nails
enough
and
it
would
be
easy
to
make
a
stage
if
john
osborne
would
help
put
it
up
all
this
talk
was
the
day
before
the
charades
in
the
midst
of
it
ann
maria
went
over
for
her
old
bonnets
and
dresses
and
umbrellas
and
they
spent
the
evening
in
trying
on
the
various
things
such
odd
caps
and
remarkable
bonnets
solomon
john
said
they
ought
to
have
plenty
of
bandboxes
if
you
only
had
bandboxes
enough
a
charade
was
sure
to
go
off
well
he
had
seen
charades
in
boston
peterkin
said
there
were
plenty
in
their
attic
and
the
little
boys
brought
down
piles
of
them
and
the
back
parlor
was
filled
with
costumes
ann
maria
said
she
could
bring
over
more
things
if
she
only
knew
what
they
were
going
to
act
elizabeth
eliza
told
her
to
bring
anything
she
had
it
would
all
come
of
use
the
morning
came
and
the
boards
were
collected
for
the
stage
agamemnon
and
solomon
john
gave
themselves
to
the
work
and
john
osborne
helped
zealously
he
said
the
would
lend
a
scene
also
there
was
a
great
clatter
of
bandboxes
and
piles
of
shawls
in
corners
and
such
a
piece
of
work
in
getting
up
the
curtain
in
the
midst
of
it
came
in
the
little
boys
shouting
all
the
tickets
are
sold
at
ten
cents
each
seventy
tickets
sold
exclaimed
agamemnon
seven
dollars
for
the
said
elizabeth
eliza
and
we
do
not
know
yet
what
we
are
going
to
act
exclaimed
ann
maria
but
everybody
s
attention
had
to
be
given
to
the
scene
that
was
going
up
in
the
background
borrowed
from
the
it
was
magnificent
and
represented
a
forest
where
are
we
going
to
put
seventy
people
exclaimed
peterkin
venturing
dismayed
into
the
heaps
of
shavings
and
boards
and
litter
the
little
boys
exclaimed
that
a
large
part
of
the
audience
consisted
of
boys
who
would
not
take
up
much
room
but
how
much
clearing
and
sweeping
and
moving
of
chairs
was
necessary
before
all
could
be
made
ready
it
was
late
and
some
of
the
people
had
already
come
to
secure
good
seats
even
before
the
actors
had
assembled
what
are
we
going
to
act
asked
ann
maria
i
have
been
so
torn
with
one
thing
and
another
said
elizabeth
eliza
i
haven
t
had
time
to
think
haven
t
you
the
word
yet
asked
john
osborne
for
the
audience
was
flocking
in
and
the
seats
were
filling
up
rapidly
i
have
got
one
word
in
my
pocket
said
elizabeth
eliza
in
the
letter
from
the
lady
from
philadelphia
she
sent
me
the
parts
of
the
word
solomon
john
is
to
be
a
turk
but
i
don
t
yet
understand
the
whole
of
the
you
don
t
know
the
word
and
the
people
are
all
here
said
john
osborne
impatiently
elizabeth
eliza
exclaimed
ann
maria
solomon
john
says
i
m
to
be
a
turkish
slave
and
i
ll
have
to
wear
a
veil
do
you

where
the
veils

you
know
i
brought
them
over
last
elizabeth
eliza
solomon
john
wants
you
to
send
him
the
large
cashmere
scarf
exclaimed
one
of
the
little
boys
coming
in
elizabeth
eliza
you
must
tell
us
what
kind
of
faces
to
make
up
cried
another
of
the
boys
and
the
audience
were
heard
meanwhile
taking
the
seats
on
the
other
side
of
the
thin
curtain
you
sit
in
front
bromwick
you
are
a
little
hard
of
hearing
sit
where
you
can
and
let
julia
fitch
come
where
she
can
see
said
another
voice
and
we
have
not
any
words
for
them
to
hear
or
see
exclaimed
john
osborne
behind
the
curtain
oh
i
wish
we
d
never
determined
to
have
charades
exclaimed
elizabeth
eliza
can
t
we
return
the
money
they
are
all
here
we
must
give
them
something
said
john
osborne
heroically
and
solomon
john
is
almost
dressed
reported
ann
maria
winding
a
veil
around
her
head
why
don
t
we
take
solomon
john
s
word
hindoos
for
the
first
said
agamemnon
john
osborne
agreed
to
go
in
the
first
hunting
the
hin
or
anything
and
one
of
the
little
boys
took
the
part
of
the
hen
with
the
help
of
a
feather
duster
the
bell
rang
and
the
first
scene
began
it
was
a
great
success
john
osborne
s
irish
was
perfect
nobody
guessed
the
word
for
the
hen
crowed
by
mistake
but
it
received
great
applause
peterkin
came
on
in
the
second
scene
to
receive
the
and
made
a
long
speech
on
taxation
he
was
interrupted
by
ann
maria
as
an
old
woman
in
a
huge
bonnet
she
persisted
in
turning
her
back
to
the
audience
speaking
so
low
nobody
heard
her
and
elizabeth
eliza
who
appeared
in
a
more
remarkable
bonnet
was
so
alarmed
she
went
directly
back
saying
she
had
forgotten
something
but
this
was
supposed
to
be
the
effect
intended
and
it
was
loudly
cheered
then
came
a
long
delay
for
the
little
boys
brought
out
a
number
of
their
friends
to
be
browned
for
hindoos
ann
maria
played
on
the
piano
till
the
scene
was
ready
the
curtain
rose
upon
five
brown
boys
done
up
in
blankets
and
turbans
i
am
thankful
that
is
over
said
elizabeth
eliza
for
now
we
can
act
my
word
only
i
don
t
myself
know
the
never
mind
let
us
act
it
said
john
osborne
and
the
audience
can
guess
the
the
first
syllable
must
be
the
letter
p
said
elizabeth
eliza
and
we
must
have
a
agamemnon
was
master
and
the
little
boys
and
their
friends
went
on
as
scholars
all
the
boys
talked
and
shouted
at
once
acting
their
idea
of
a
school
by
flinging
about
and
scoffing
at
the
master
they
ll
guess
that
to
be
row
said
john
osborne
in
despair
they
ll
never
guess
p
the
next
scene
was
gorgeous
solomon
john
as
a
turk
reclined
on
john
osborne
s
he
had
on
a
turban
and
a
long
beard
and
all
the
family
shawls
ann
maria
and
elizabeth
eliza
were
brought
in
to
him
veiled
by
the
little
boys
in
their
hindoo
costumes
this
was
considered
the
great
scene
of
the
evening
though
elizabeth
eliza
was
sure
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
whether
to
kneel
or
sit
down
she
did
not
know
whether
turkish
women
did
sit
down
and
she
could
not
help
laughing
whenever
she
looked
at
solomon
john
he
however
kept
his
solemnity
i
suppose
i
need
not
say
much
he
had
said
for
i
shall
be
the
turk
who
was
dreaming
of
the
but
he
did
order
the
little
boys
to
bring
sherbet
and
when
they
brought
it
without
ice
insisted
they
must
have
their
heads
cut
off
and
ann
maria
fainted
and
the
scene
closed
what
are
we
to
do
now
asked
john
osborne
warming
up
to
the
occasion
we
must
have
an
inn
scene
said
elizabeth
eliza
consulting
her
letter
two
inns
if
we
we
will
have
some
travellers
disgusted
with
one
inn
and
going
to
another
said
john
osborne
now
is
the
time
for
the
bandboxes
said
solomon
john
who
since
his
turk
scene
was
over
could
give
his
attention
to
the
rest
of
the
charade
elizabeth
eliza
and
ann
maria
went
on
as
rival
hostesses
trying
to
draw
solomon
john
agamemnon
and
john
osborne
into
their
several
inns
the
little
boys
carried
valises
umbrellas
and
bandboxes
bandbox
after
bandbox
appeared
and
when
agamemnon
sat
down
upon
his
the
applause
was
immense
at
last
the
curtain
fell
now
for
the
whole
said
john
osborne
as
he
made
his
way
off
the
stage
over
a
heap
of
umbrellas
i
can
t
think
why
the
lady
from
philadelphia
did
not
send
me
the
whole
said
elizabeth
eliza
musing
over
the
letter
listen
they
are
guessing
said
john
osborne
i
don
t
wonder
they
get
it
but
we
know
it
can
t
be
that
exclaimed
elizabeth
eliza
in
agony
how
can
we
act
the
whole
if
we
don
t
know
it
ourselves
oh
i
see
it
said
ann
maria
clapping
her
hands
get
your
whole
family
in
for
the
last
and
peterkin
were
summoned
to
the
stage
and
formed
the
background
standing
on
stools
in
front
were
agamemnon
and
solomon
john
leaving
room
for
elizabeth
eliza
between
a
little
in
advance
and
in
front
of
all
half
kneeling
were
the
little
boys
in
their
boots
the
audience
rose
to
an
exclamation
of
delight
the
peterkins
it
was
not
until
this
moment
that
elizabeth
eliza
guessed
the
whole
what
a
tableau
exclaimed
bromwick
the
peterkin
family
guessing
their
own
the
peterkins
are
obliged
to
move
agamemnon
had
long
felt
it
an
impropriety
to
live
in
a
house
that
was
called
a
house
when
there
was
no
other
semi
to
it
it
had
always
remained
wholly
detached
as
the
owner
had
never
built
the
other
half
peterkin
felt
this
was
not
a
sufficient
reason
for
undertaking
the
terrible
process
of
a
move
to
another
house
when
they
were
fully
satisfied
with
the
one
they
were
in
but
a
more
powerful
reason
forced
them
to
go
the
track
of
a
new
railroad
had
to
be
carried
directly
through
the
place
and
a
station
was
to
be
built
on
that
very
spot
peterkin
so
much
dreaded
moving
that
she
questioned
whether
they
could
not
continue
to
live
in
the
upper
part
of
the
house
and
give
up
the
lower
part
to
the
station
they
could
then
dine
at
the
restaurant
and
it
would
be
very
convenient
about
travelling
as
there
would
be
no
danger
of
missing
the
train
if
one
were
sure
of
the
direction
but
when
the
track
was
actually
laid
by
the
side
of
the
house
and
the
of
the
construction
train
puffed
and
screamed
under
the
windows
and
the
engineer
calmly
looked
in
to
see
what
the
family
had
for
dinner
she
felt
indeed
that
they
must
move
but
where
should
they
go
it
was
difficult
to
find
a
house
that
satisfied
the
whole
family
one
was
too
far
off
and
looked
into
a
another
was
too
much
in
the
middle
of
the
town
next
door
to
a
elizabeth
eliza
wanted
a
porch
covered
with
vines
that
should
face
the
sunset
while
peterkin
thought
it
would
not
be
convenient
to
sit
there
looking
towards
the
west
in
the
late
afternoon
which
was
his
only
leisure
time
for
the
sun
would
shine
in
his
face
the
little
boys
wanted
a
house
with
a
great
many
doors
so
that
they
could
go
in
and
out
often
but
peterkin
did
not
like
so
much
slamming
and
felt
there
was
more
danger
of
burglars
with
so
many
doors
agamemnon
wanted
an
observatory
and
solomon
john
a
shed
for
a
workshop
if
he
could
have
carpenters
tools
and
a
workbench
he
could
build
an
observatory
if
it
were
wanted
but
it
was
necessary
to
decide
upon
something
for
they
must
leave
their
house
directly
so
they
were
obliged
to
take
finch
s
at
the
corners
it
satisfied
none
of
the
family
the
porch
was
a
piazza
and
was
opposite
a
barn
there
were
three
other
doors
too
many
to
please
peterkin
and
not
enough
for
the
little
boys
there
was
no
observatory
and
nothing
to
observe
if
there
were
one
as
the
house
was
too
low
and
some
high
trees
shut
out
any
view
elizabeth
eliza
had
hoped
for
a
view
but
peterkin
con
soled
her
by
deciding
it
was
more
healthy
to
have
to
walk
for
a
view
and
peterkin
agreed
that
they
might
get
tired
of
the
same
every
day
and
everybody
was
glad
a
selection
was
made
and
the
little
boys
carried
their
boots
the
very
first
afternoon
elizabeth
eliza
wanted
to
have
some
system
in
the
moving
and
spent
the
evening
in
drawing
up
a
plan
it
would
be
easy
to
arrange
everything
beforehand
so
that
there
should
not
be
the
confusion
that
her
mother
dreaded
and
the
discomfort
they
had
in
their
last
move
peterkin
shook
her
head
she
did
not
think
it
possible
to
move
with
any
comfort
agamemnon
said
a
great
deal
could
be
done
with
a
list
and
a
programme
elizabeth
eliza
declared
if
all
were
well
arranged
a
programme
would
make
it
perfectly
easy
they
were
to
have
new
parlor
carpets
which
could
be
put
down
in
the
new
house
the
first
thing
then
the
parlor
furniture
could
be
moved
in
and
there
would
be
two
comfortable
rooms
in
which
and
peterkin
could
sit
while
the
rest
of
the
move
went
on
then
the
old
parlor
carpets
could
be
taken
up
for
the
new
and
the
downstairs
bedroom
and
the
family
could
meanwhile
dine
at
the
old
house
peterkin
did
not
object
to
this
though
the
distance
was
considerable
as
he
felt
exercise
would
be
good
for
them
all
elizabeth
eliza
s
programme
then
arranged
that
the
furniture
should
be
moved
the
third
day
by
which
time
one
of
the
old
parlor
carpets
would
be
down
in
the
new
and
they
could
still
sleep
in
the
old
house
thus
there
would
always
be
a
quiet
comfortable
place
in
one
house
or
the
other
each
night
when
peterkin
came
home
he
would
find
some
place
for
quiet
thought
and
rest
and
each
day
there
should
be
moved
only
the
furniture
needed
for
a
certain
room
great
confusion
would
be
avoided
and
nothing
misplaced
elizabeth
eliza
wrote
these
last
words
at
the
head
of
her
programme
misplace
and
agamemnon
made
a
copy
of
the
programme
for
each
member
of
the
family
the
peterkins
are
page
the
first
thing
to
be
done
was
to
buy
the
parlor
carpets
elizabeth
eliza
had
already
looked
at
some
in
boston
and
the
next
morning
she
went
by
an
early
train
with
her
father
agamemnon
and
solomon
john
to
decide
upon
them
they
got
home
about
eleven
o
clock
and
when
they
reached
the
house
were
dismayed
to
find
two
furniture
wagons
in
front
of
the
gate
already
partly
filled
peterkin
was
walking
in
and
out
of
the
open
door
a
large
book
in
one
hand
and
a
duster
in
the
other
and
she
came
to
meet
them
in
an
agony
of
anxiety
what
should
they
do
the
furniture
carts
had
appeared
soon
after
the
rest
had
left
for
boston
and
the
men
had
insisted
upon
beginning
to
move
the
things
in
vain
had
she
shown
elizabeth
eliza
s
programme
in
vain
had
she
insisted
they
must
take
only
the
parlor
furniture
they
had
declared
they
must
put
the
heavy
pieces
in
the
bottom
of
the
cart
and
the
lighter
furniture
on
top
so
she
had
seen
them
go
into
every
room
in
the
house
and
select
one
piece
of
furniture
after
another
without
even
looking
at
elizabeth
eliza
s
programme
she
doubted
if
they
could
have
read
it
if
they
had
looked
at
it
peterkin
had
ordered
the
carters
to
come
but
he
had
no
idea
they
would
come
so
early
and
supposed
it
would
take
them
a
long
time
to
fill
the
carts
but
they
had
taken
the
sideboard
first
a
heavy
piece
of
furniture
and
all
its
contents
were
now
on
the
tables
then
indeed
they
selected
the
parlor
but
had
set
every
book
on
the
floor
the
men
had
told
peterkin
they
would
put
the
books
in
the
bottom
of
the
cart
very
much
in
the
order
they
were
taken
from
the
shelves
but
by
this
time
peterkin
was
considering
the
carters
as
natural
enemies
and
dared
not
trust
them
besides
the
books
ought
all
to
be
dusted
so
she
was
now
holding
one
of
the
volumes
of
agamemnon
s
encyclopædia
with
difficulty
in
one
hand
while
she
was
dusting
it
with
the
other
elizabeth
eliza
was
in
dismay
at
this
moment
four
men
were
bringing
down
a
large
chest
of
drawers
from
her
father
s
room
and
they
called
to
her
to
stand
out
of
the
way
the
parlors
were
a
scene
of
confusion
in
dusting
the
books
peterkin
neglected
to
restore
them
to
the
careful
rows
in
which
they
were
left
by
the
men
and
they
lay
in
hopeless
masses
in
different
parts
of
the
room
elizabeth
eliza
sunk
in
despair
upon
the
end
of
a
sofa
it
would
have
been
better
to
buy
the
red
and
blue
carpet
said
solomon
john
is
not
the
carpet
bought
exclaimed
peterkin
and
then
they
were
obliged
to
confess
they
had
been
unable
to
decide
upon
one
and
had
come
back
to
consult
peterkin
what
shall
we
do
asked
peterkin
elizabeth
eliza
rose
from
the
sofa
and
went
to
the
door
saying
i
shall
be
back
in
a
agamemnon
slowly
passed
round
the
room
collecting
the
scattered
volumes
of
his
encyclopædia
peterkin
offered
a
helping
hand
to
a
man
lifting
a
wardrobe
elizabeth
eliza
soon
returned
i
did
not
like
to
go
and
ask
her
but
i
felt
that
i
must
in
such
an
emergency
i
explained
to
her
the
whole
matter
and
she
thinks
we
should
take
the
carpet
at
makillan
makillan
s
was
a
store
in
the
village
and
the
carpet
was
the
only
one
all
the
family
had
liked
without
any
doubt
but
they
had
supposed
they
might
prefer
one
from
boston
the
moment
was
a
critical
one
solomon
john
was
sent
directly
to
makillan
s
to
order
the
carpet
to
be
put
down
that
very
day
but
where
should
they
dine
where
should
they
have
their
supper
and
where
was
peterkin
s
quiet
hour
elizabeth
eliza
was
frantic
the
floor
and
table
were
covered
with
things
it
was
decided
that
and
peterkin
should
dine
at
the
bromwicks
who
had
been
most
neighborly
in
their
offers
and
the
rest
should
get
something
to
eat
at
the
baker
s
agamemnon
and
elizabeth
eliza
hastened
away
to
be
ready
to
receive
the
carts
at
the
other
house
and
direct
the
furniture
as
they
could
after
all
there
was
something
exhilarating
in
this
opening
of
the
new
house
and
in
deciding
where
things
should
go
gayly
elizabeth
eliza
stepped
down
the
front
garden
of
the
new
home
and
across
the
piazza
and
to
the
door
but
it
was
locked
and
she
had
no
keys
agamemnon
did
you
bring
the
keys
she
exclaimed
no
he
had
not
seen
them
since
the
morning
when
ah
yes
the
little
boys
were
allowed
to
go
to
the
house
for
their
boots
as
there
was
a
threatening
of
rain
perhaps
they
had
left
some
door
unfastened
perhaps
they
had
put
the
keys
under
the
no
each
door
each
window
was
solidly
closed
and
there
was
no
mat
i
shall
have
to
go
to
the
school
to
see
if
they
took
the
keys
with
them
said
agamemnon
or
else
go
home
to
see
if
they
left
them
the
school
was
in
a
different
direction
from
the
house
and
far
at
the
other
end
of
the
town
for
peterkin
had
not
yet
changed
the
boys
school
as
he
proposed
to
do
after
their
move
that
will
be
the
only
way
said
elizabeth
eliza
for
it
had
been
arranged
that
the
little
boys
should
take
their
lunch
to
school
and
not
come
home
at
noon
she
sat
down
on
the
steps
to
wait
but
only
for
a
moment
for
the
carts
soon
appeared
turning
the
corner
what
should
be
done
with
the
furniture
of
course
the
carters
must
wait
for
the
keys
as
she
should
need
them
to
set
the
furniture
up
in
the
right
places
but
they
could
not
stop
for
this
they
put
it
down
upon
the
piazza
on
the
steps
in
the
garden
and
elizabeth
eliza
saw
how
incongruous
it
was
there
was
something
from
every
room
in
the
house
even
the
large
family
chest
which
had
proved
too
heavy
for
them
to
travel
with
had
come
down
from
the
attic
and
stood
against
the
front
door
and
solomon
john
appeared
with
the
carpet
woman
and
a
boy
with
a
wheelbarrow
bringing
the
new
carpet
and
all
stood
and
waited
some
opposite
neighbors
appeared
to
offer
advice
and
look
on
and
elizabeth
eliza
groaned
inwardly
that
only
the
shabbiest
of
their
furniture
appeared
to
be
standing
full
in
view
it
seemed
ages
before
agamemnon
returned
and
no
wonder
for
he
had
been
to
the
house
then
to
the
school
then
back
to
the
house
for
one
of
the
little
boys
had
left
the
keys
at
home
in
the
pocket
of
his
clothes
meanwhile
the
had
waited
and
the
boy
with
the
wheelbarrow
had
waited
and
when
they
got
in
they
found
the
parlor
must
be
swept
and
cleaned
so
the
went
off
in
dudgeon
for
she
was
sure
there
would
not
be
time
enough
to
do
anything
and
one
of
the
carts
came
again
and
in
their
hurry
the
men
set
the
furniture
down
anywhere
elizabeth
eliza
was
hoping
to
make
a
little
place
in
the
where
they
might
have
their
supper
and
go
home
to
sleep
but
she
looked
out
and
there
were
the
carters
bringing
the
bedsteads
and
proceeding
to
carry
them
upstairs
in
despair
elizabeth
eliza
went
back
to
the
old
house
if
she
had
been
there
she
might
have
prevented
this
she
found
peterkin
in
an
agony
about
the
entry
it
had
been
made
in
the
house
and
how
could
it
be
taken
out
of
the
house
agamemnon
made
measurements
it
certainly
could
not
go
out
of
the
front
door
he
suggested
it
might
be
left
till
the
house
was
pulled
down
when
it
could
easily
be
moved
out
of
one
side
but
elizabeth
eliza
reminded
him
that
the
whole
house
was
to
be
moved
without
being
taken
apart
perhaps
it
could
be
cut
in
strips
narrow
enough
to
go
out
one
of
the
men
loading
the
remaining
cart
disposed
of
the
question
by
coming
in
and
rolling
up
the
and
carrying
it
on
on
top
of
his
wagon
elizabeth
eliza
felt
she
must
hurry
back
to
the
new
house
but
what
should
they
do
no
beds
here
no
carpets
there
the
table
and
sideboard
were
at
the
other
house
the
plates
and
forks
and
spoons
here
in
vain
she
looked
at
her
programme
it
was
all
reversed
everything
was
misplaced
peterkin
would
suppose
they
were
to
eat
here
and
sleep
here
and
what
had
become
of
the
little
boys
meanwhile
the
man
with
the
first
cart
had
returned
they
fell
to
packing
the
china
they
were
up
in
the
attic
they
were
down
in
the
cellar
even
one
suggested
to
take
the
tacks
out
of
the
parlor
carpets
as
they
should
want
to
take
them
next
peterkin
sunk
upon
a
kitchen
chair
oh
i
wish
we
had
decided
to
stay
and
be
moved
in
the
house
she
exclaimed
solomon
john
urged
his
mother
to
go
to
the
new
house
for
peterkin
would
be
there
for
his
quiet
and
when
the
carters
at
last
appeared
carrying
the
parlor
carpets
on
their
shoulders
she
sighed
and
said
there
is
nothing
left
and
meekly
consented
to
be
led
away
they
reached
the
new
house
to
find
peterkin
sitting
calmly
in
a
on
the
piazza
watching
the
oxen
coming
into
the
opposite
barn
he
was
waiting
for
the
keys
which
solomon
john
had
taken
back
with
him
the
little
boys
were
in
a
tree
at
the
side
of
the
house
agamemnon
opened
the
door
the
passages
were
crowded
with
furniture
the
floors
were
strewn
with
books
the
bureau
was
upstairs
that
was
to
stand
in
a
lower
bedroom
there
was
not
a
place
to
lay
a
table
there
was
nothing
to
lay
upon
it
for
the
knives
and
plates
and
spoons
had
not
come
and
although
the
tables
were
there
they
were
covered
with
chairs
and
boxes
at
this
moment
came
a
covered
basket
from
the
lady
from
philadelphia
it
contained
a
choice
supper
and
forks
and
spoons
and
at
the
same
moment
appeared
a
pot
of
hot
tea
from
an
opposite
neighbor
they
placed
all
this
on
the
back
of
a
bookcase
lying
upset
and
sat
around
it
solomon
john
came
rushing
in
from
the
gate
the
last
load
is
coming
we
are
all
moved
he
exclaimed
and
the
little
boys
joined
in
a
chorus
we
are
moved
we
are
moved
peterkin
looked
sadly
round
the
kitchen
utensils
were
lying
on
the
parlor
lounge
and
an
old
family
gun
on
elizabeth
eliza
s
the
parlor
clock
stood
on
a
barrel
some
had
been
placed
on
the
parlor
table
a
bust
of
washington
stood
in
the
and
the
leaned
against
the
pillars
of
the
piazza
but
they
were
moved
peterkin
felt
indeed
that
they
were
very
much
moved
the
peterkins
decide
to
learn
the
languages
certainly
now
was
the
time
to
study
the
languages
the
peterkins
had
moved
into
a
new
house
far
more
convenient
than
their
old
one
where
they
would
have
a
place
for
everything
and
everything
in
its
place
of
course
they
would
then
have
more
time
elizabeth
eliza
recalled
the
troubles
of
the
old
house
how
for
a
long
time
she
was
obliged
to
sit
outside
of
the
window
upon
the
piazza
when
she
wanted
to
play
on
her
piano
peterkin
reminded
them
of
the
difficulty
about
the
the
upper
was
kept
in
a
trunk
that
had
to
stand
in
front
of
the
door
to
the
closet
under
the
stairs
but
the
under
was
kept
in
a
drawer
in
the
closet
so
whenever
the
cloths
were
changed
the
trunk
had
to
be
pushed
away
under
some
projecting
shelves
to
make
room
for
opening
the
as
the
under
must
be
taken
out
first
then
the
trunk
was
pushed
back
to
make
room
for
it
to
be
opened
for
the
upper
and
after
all
it
was
necessary
to
push
the
trunk
away
again
to
open
the
for
the
this
always
consumed
a
great
deal
of
time
now
that
the
was
large
enough
everything
could
find
a
place
in
it
agamemnon
especially
enjoyed
the
new
library
in
the
old
house
there
was
no
separate
room
for
books
the
dictionaries
were
kept
upstairs
which
was
very
inconvenient
and
the
volumes
of
the
encyclopædia
could
not
be
together
there
was
not
room
for
all
in
one
place
so
from
a
to
p
were
to
be
found
downstairs
and
from
q
to
z
were
scattered
in
different
rooms
upstairs
and
the
worst
of
it
was
you
could
never
remember
whether
from
a
to
p
included
i
always
went
upstairs
after
p
said
agamemnon
and
then
always
found
it
downstairs
or
else
it
was
the
other
of
course
now
there
were
more
conveniences
for
study
with
the
books
all
in
one
room
there
would
be
no
time
wasted
in
looking
for
them
peterkin
suggested
they
should
each
take
a
separate
language
if
they
went
abroad
this
would
prove
a
great
convenience
elizabeth
eliza
could
talk
french
with
the
parisians
agamemnon
german
with
the
germans
solomon
john
italian
with
the
italians
peterkin
spanish
in
spain
and
perhaps
he
could
himself
master
all
the
eastern
languages
and
russian
peterkin
was
uncertain
about
undertaking
the
spanish
but
all
the
family
felt
very
sure
they
should
not
go
to
spain
as
elizabeth
eliza
dreaded
the
inquisition
and
peterkin
felt
more
willing
still
she
had
quite
an
objection
to
going
abroad
she
had
always
said
she
would
not
go
till
a
bridge
was
made
across
the
atlantic
and
she
was
sure
it
did
not
look
like
it
now
agamemnon
said
there
was
no
knowing
there
was
something
new
every
day
and
a
bridge
was
surely
not
harder
to
invent
than
a
telephone
for
they
had
bridges
in
the
very
earliest
days
then
came
up
the
question
of
the
teachers
probably
these
could
be
found
in
boston
if
they
could
all
come
the
same
day
three
could
be
brought
out
in
the
carryall
agamemnon
could
go
in
for
them
and
could
learn
a
little
on
the
way
out
and
in
peterkin
made
some
inquiries
about
the
oriental
languages
he
was
told
that
sanscrit
was
at
the
root
of
all
so
he
proposed
they
should
all
begin
with
sanscrit
they
would
thus
require
but
one
teacher
and
could
branch
out
into
the
other
languages
afterward
but
the
family
preferred
learning
the
separate
languages
elizabeth
eliza
already
knew
something
of
the
french
she
had
tried
to
talk
it
without
much
success
at
the
centennial
exhibition
at
one
of
the
but
she
found
she
had
been
talking
with
a
moorish
gentleman
who
did
not
understand
french
peterkin
feared
they
might
need
more
libraries
if
all
the
teachers
came
at
the
same
hour
but
agamemnon
reminded
him
that
they
would
be
using
different
dictionaries
and
peterkin
thought
something
might
be
learned
by
having
them
all
at
once
each
one
might
pick
up
something
beside
the
language
he
was
studying
and
it
was
a
great
thing
to
learn
to
talk
a
foreign
language
while
others
were
talking
about
you
peterkin
was
afraid
it
would
be
like
the
tower
of
babel
and
hoped
it
was
all
right
agamemnon
brought
forward
another
difficulty
of
course
they
ought
to
have
foreign
teachers
who
spoke
only
their
native
languages
but
in
this
case
how
could
they
engage
them
to
come
or
explain
to
them
about
the
carryall
or
arrange
the
proposed
hours
he
did
not
understand
how
anybody
ever
began
with
a
foreigner
because
he
could
not
even
tell
him
what
he
wanted
elizabeth
eliza
thought
a
great
deal
might
be
done
by
signs
and
pantomime
solomon
john
and
the
little
boys
began
to
show
how
it
might
be
done
elizabeth
eliza
explained
how
langues
meant
both
languages
and
tongues
and
they
could
point
to
their
tongues
for
practice
the
little
boys
represented
the
foreign
teachers
talking
in
their
different
languages
and
agamemnon
and
solomon
john
went
to
invite
them
to
come
out
and
teach
the
family
by
a
series
of
signs
peterkin
thought
their
success
was
admirable
and
that
they
might
almost
go
abroad
without
any
study
of
the
languages
and
trust
to
explaining
themselves
by
signs
still
as
the
bridge
was
not
yet
made
it
might
be
as
well
to
wait
and
cultivate
the
languages
peterkin
was
afraid
the
foreign
teachers
might
imagine
they
were
invited
out
to
lunch
solomon
john
had
constantly
pointed
to
his
mouth
as
he
opened
it
and
shut
it
putting
out
his
tongue
and
it
looked
a
great
deal
more
as
if
he
were
inviting
them
to
eat
than
asking
them
to
teach
agamemnon
suggested
that
they
might
carry
the
separate
dictionaries
when
they
went
to
see
the
teachers
and
that
would
show
that
they
meant
lessons
and
not
lunch
peterkin
was
not
sure
but
she
ought
to
prepare
a
lunch
for
them
if
they
had
come
all
that
way
but
she
certainly
did
not
know
what
they
were
accustomed
to
eat
peterkin
thought
this
would
be
a
good
thing
to
learn
of
the
foreigners
it
would
be
a
good
preparation
for
going
abroad
and
they
might
get
used
to
the
dishes
before
starting
the
little
boys
were
delighted
at
the
idea
of
having
new
things
cooked
agamemnon
had
heard
that
was
a
favorite
dish
with
the
germans
and
he
would
inquire
how
it
was
made
in
the
first
lesson
solomon
john
had
heard
they
were
all
very
fond
of
garlic
and
thought
it
would
be
a
pretty
attention
to
have
some
in
the
house
the
first
day
that
they
might
be
cheered
by
the
odor
elizabeth
eliza
wanted
to
surprise
the
lady
from
philadelphia
by
her
knowledge
of
french
and
hoped
to
begin
on
her
lessons
before
the
philadelphia
family
arrived
for
their
annual
visit
there
were
still
some
delays
peterkin
was
very
anxious
to
obtain
teachers
who
had
been
but
a
short
time
in
this
country
he
did
not
want
to
be
tempted
to
talk
any
english
with
them
he
wanted
the
latest
and
freshest
languages
and
at
last
came
home
one
day
with
a
list
of
they
decided
to
borrow
the
bromwicks
carryall
to
use
beside
their
own
for
the
first
day
and
peterkin
and
agamemnon
drove
into
town
to
bring
all
the
teachers
out
one
was
a
russian
gentleman
travelling
who
came
with
no
idea
of
giving
lessons
but
perhaps
he
would
consent
to
do
so
he
could
not
yet
speak
english
peterkin
had
his
and
the
cards
of
the
several
gentlemen
who
had
recommended
the
different
teachers
and
he
went
with
agamemnon
from
hotel
to
hotel
collecting
them
he
found
them
all
very
polite
and
ready
to
come
after
the
explanation
by
signs
agreed
upon
the
dictionaries
had
been
forgotten
but
agamemnon
had
a
directory
which
looked
the
same
and
seemed
to
satisfy
the
foreigners
peterkin
was
obliged
to
content
himself
with
the
russian
instead
of
one
who
could
teach
sanscrit
as
there
was
no
new
teacher
of
that
language
lately
arrived
but
there
was
an
unexpected
difficulty
in
getting
the
russian
gentleman
into
the
same
carriage
with
the
teacher
of
arabic
for
he
was
a
turk
sitting
with
a
fez
on
his
head
on
the
back
seat
they
glared
at
each
other
and
began
to
assail
each
other
in
every
language
they
knew
none
of
which
peterkin
could
understand
it
might
be
russian
it
might
be
arabic
it
was
easy
to
understand
that
they
would
never
consent
to
sit
in
the
same
carriage
peterkin
was
in
despair
he
had
forgotten
about
the
russian
war
what
a
mistake
to
have
invited
the
turk
quite
a
crowd
collected
on
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
the
hotel
but
the
french
gentleman
politely
but
stiffly
invited
the
russian
to
go
with
him
in
the
first
carryall
here
was
another
difficulty
for
the
german
professor
was
quietly
ensconced
on
the
back
seat
as
soon
as
the
french
gentleman
put
his
foot
on
the
step
and
saw
him
he
addressed
him
in
such
forcible
language
that
the
german
professor
got
out
of
the
door
the
other
side
and
came
round
on
the
sidewalk
and
took
him
by
the
collar
certainly
the
german
and
french
gentlemen
could
not
be
put
together
and
more
crowd
collected
agamemnon
however
had
happily
studied
up
the
german
word
herr
and
he
applied
it
to
the
german
inviting
him
by
signs
to
take
a
seat
in
the
other
carryall
the
german
consented
to
sit
by
the
turk
as
they
neither
of
them
could
understand
the
other
and
at
last
they
started
peterkin
with
the
italian
by
his
side
and
the
french
and
russian
teachers
behind
vociferating
to
each
other
in
languages
unknown
to
peterkin
while
he
feared
they
were
not
perfectly
in
harmony
so
he
drove
home
as
fast
as
possible
agamemnon
had
a
silent
party
the
spaniard
by
his
side
was
a
little
moody
while
the
turk
and
the
german
behind
did
not
utter
a
word
at
last
they
reached
the
house
and
were
greeted
by
peterkin
and
elizabeth
eliza
peterkin
with
her
llama
lace
shawl
over
her
shoulders
as
a
tribute
to
the
spanish
teacher
peterkin
was
careful
to
take
his
party
in
first
and
deposit
them
in
a
distant
part
of
the
library
far
from
the
turk
or
the
german
even
putting
the
frenchman
and
russian
apart
solomon
john
found
the
italian
dictionary
and
seated
himself
by
his
italian
agamemnon
with
the
german
dictionary
by
the
german
the
little
boys
took
their
copy
of
the
arabian
nights
to
the
turk
peterkin
attempted
to
explain
to
the
russian
that
he
had
no
russian
dictionary
as
he
had
hoped
to
learn
sanscrit
of
him
while
peterkin
was
trying
to
inform
her
teacher
that
she
had
no
books
in
spanish
she
got
over
all
fears
of
the
inquisition
he
looked
so
sad
and
she
tried
to
talk
a
little
using
english
words
but
very
slowly
and
altering
the
accent
as
far
as
she
knew
how
the
spaniard
bowed
looked
gravely
interested
and
was
very
polite
elizabeth
eliza
meanwhile
was
trying
her
grammar
phrases
with
the
parisian
she
found
it
easier
to
talk
french
than
to
understand
him
but
he
understood
perfectly
her
sentences
she
repeated
one
of
her
vocabularies
and
went
on
with
j
ai
le
le
pain
l
enfant
a
une
he
listened
with
great
attention
and
replied
slowly
suddenly
she
started
after
making
out
one
of
his
sentences
and
went
to
her
mother
to
whisper
they
have
made
the
mistake
you
feared
they
think
they
are
invited
to
lunch
he
has
just
been
thanking
me
for
our
politeness
in
inviting
them
to
déjeûner
that
means
breakfast
they
have
not
had
their
breakfast
exclaimed
peterkin
looking
at
her
spaniard
he
does
look
hungry
what
shall
we
do
elizabeth
eliza
was
consulting
her
father
what
should
they
do
how
should
they
make
them
understand
that
they
invited
them
to
teach
not
lunch
elizabeth
eliza
begged
agamemnon
to
look
out
apprendre
in
the
dictionary
it
must
mean
to
teach
alas
they
found
it
means
both
to
teach
and
to
learn
what
should
they
do
the
foreigners
were
now
sitting
silent
in
their
different
corners
the
spaniard
grew
more
and
more
sallow
what
if
he
should
faint
the
frenchman
was
rolling
up
each
of
his
mustaches
to
a
point
as
he
gazed
at
the
german
what
if
the
russian
should
fight
the
turk
what
if
the
german
should
be
exasperated
by
the
airs
of
the
parisian
we
must
give
them
something
to
eat
said
peterkin
in
a
low
tone
it
would
calm
if
i
only
knew
what
they
were
used
to
eating
said
peterkin
solomon
john
suggested
that
none
of
them
knew
what
the
others
were
used
to
eating
and
they
might
bring
in
anything
peterkin
hastened
out
with
hospitable
intents
amanda
could
make
good
coffee
peterkin
had
suggested
some
american
dish
solomon
john
sent
a
little
boy
for
some
olives
it
was
not
long
before
the
coffee
came
in
and
a
dish
of
baked
beans
next
some
olives
and
a
loaf
of
bread
and
some
boiled
eggs
and
some
bottles
of
beer
the
effect
was
astonishing
every
man
spoke
his
own
tongue
and
fluently
peterkin
poured
out
coffee
for
the
spaniard
while
he
bowed
to
her
they
all
liked
beer
they
all
liked
olives
the
frenchman
was
fluent
about
les
moeurs
elizabeth
eliza
supposed
he
alluded
to
their
not
having
set
any
table
the
turk
smiled
the
russian
was
voluble
in
the
midst
of
the
clang
of
the
different
languages
just
as
peterkin
was
again
repeating
under
cover
of
the
noise
of
many
tongues
how
shall
we
make
them
understand
that
we
want
them
to
teach
at
this
very
moment
the
door
was
flung
open
and
there
came
in
the
lady
from
philadelphia
that
day
arrived
her
first
call
of
the
season
she
started
back
in
terror
at
the
tumult
of
so
many
different
languages
the
family
with
joy
rushed
to
meet
her
all
together
they
called
upon
her
to
explain
for
them
could
she
help
them
could
she
tell
the
foreigners
they
wanted
to
take
lessons
lessons
they
had
no
sooner
uttered
the
word
than
their
guests
all
started
up
with
faces
beaming
with
joy
it
was
the
one
english
word
they
all
knew
they
had
come
to
boston
to
give
lessons
the
russian
traveller
had
hoped
to
learn
english
in
this
way
the
thought
pleased
them
more
than
the
déjeûner
yes
gladly
would
they
give
lessons
the
turk
smiled
at
the
idea
the
first
step
was
taken
the
teachers
knew
they
were
expected
to
teach
modern
improvements
at
the
peterkins
agamemnon
felt
that
it
became
necessary
for
him
to
choose
a
profession
it
was
important
on
account
of
the
little
boys
if
he
should
make
a
trial
of
several
different
professions
he
could
find
out
which
would
be
the
most
likely
to
be
successful
and
it
would
then
be
easy
to
bring
up
the
little
boys
in
the
right
direction
elizabeth
eliza
agreed
with
this
she
thought
the
family
occasionally
made
mistakes
and
had
come
near
disgracing
themselves
now
was
their
chance
to
avoid
this
in
future
by
giving
the
little
boys
a
proper
education
solomon
john
was
almost
determined
to
become
a
doctor
from
earliest
childhood
he
had
practiced
writing
recipes
on
little
slips
of
paper
peterkin
to
be
sure
was
afraid
of
infection
she
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
his
bringing
one
disease
after
the
other
into
the
family
circle
solomon
john
too
did
not
like
sick
people
he
thought
he
might
manage
it
if
he
should
not
have
to
see
his
patients
while
they
were
sick
if
he
could
only
visit
them
when
they
were
recovering
and
when
the
danger
of
infection
was
over
he
would
really
enjoy
making
calls
he
should
have
a
comfortable
doctor
s
chaise
and
take
one
of
the
little
boys
to
hold
his
horse
while
he
went
in
and
he
thought
he
could
get
through
the
conversational
part
very
well
and
feeling
the
pulse
perhaps
looking
at
the
tongue
he
should
take
and
read
all
the
newspapers
and
so
be
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
news
of
the
day
to
talk
of
but
he
should
not
like
to
be
waked
up
at
night
to
visit
peterkin
thought
that
would
not
be
necessary
he
had
seen
signs
on
doors
of
night
doctor
and
certainly
it
would
be
as
convenient
to
have
a
sign
of
not
a
night
solomon
john
thought
he
might
write
his
advice
to
those
of
his
patients
who
were
dangerously
ill
from
whom
there
was
danger
of
infection
and
then
elizabeth
eliza
agreed
that
his
prescriptions
would
probably
be
so
satisfactory
that
they
would
keep
his
patients
well
not
too
well
to
do
without
a
doctor
but
needing
his
recipes
agamemnon
was
delayed
however
in
his
choice
of
a
profession
by
a
desire
he
had
to
become
a
famous
inventor
if
he
could
only
invent
something
important
and
get
out
a
patent
he
would
make
himself
known
all
over
the
country
if
he
could
get
out
a
patent
he
would
be
set
up
for
life
or
at
least
as
long
as
the
patent
lasted
and
it
would
be
well
to
be
sure
to
arrange
it
to
last
through
his
natural
life
indeed
he
had
gone
so
far
as
to
make
his
invention
it
had
been
suggested
by
their
trouble
with
a
key
in
their
late
moving
to
their
new
house
he
had
studied
the
matter
over
a
great
deal
he
looked
it
up
in
the
encyclopædia
and
had
spent
a
day
or
two
in
the
public
library
in
reading
about
chubb
s
lock
and
other
patent
locks
but
his
plan
was
more
simple
it
was
this
that
all
keys
should
be
made
alike
he
wondered
it
had
not
been
thought
of
before
but
so
it
was
solomon
john
said
with
all
inventions
with
christopher
columbus
and
everybody
nobody
knew
the
invention
till
it
was
invented
and
then
it
looked
very
simple
with
agamemnon
s
plan
you
need
have
but
one
key
that
should
fit
everything
it
should
be
a
key
not
too
large
to
carry
it
ought
to
answer
for
a
house
door
but
you
might
open
a
portmanteau
with
it
how
much
less
danger
there
would
be
of
losing
one
s
keys
if
there
were
only
one
to
lose
peterkin
thought
it
would
be
inconvenient
if
their
father
were
out
and
she
wanted
to
open
the
for
the
little
boys
but
agamemnon
explained
that
he
did
not
mean
there
should
be
but
one
key
in
the
family
or
in
a
town
you
might
have
as
many
as
you
pleased
only
they
should
all
be
alike
elizabeth
eliza
felt
it
would
be
a
great
convenience
they
could
keep
the
front
door
always
locked
yet
she
could
open
it
with
the
key
of
her
upper
drawer
that
she
was
sure
to
have
with
her
and
peterkin
felt
it
might
be
a
convenience
if
they
had
one
on
each
story
so
that
they
need
not
go
up
and
down
for
it
peterkin
studied
all
the
papers
and
advertisements
to
decide
about
the
lawyer
whom
they
should
consult
and
at
last
one
morning
they
went
into
town
to
visit
a
elizabeth
eliza
took
the
occasion
to
make
a
call
upon
the
lady
from
philadelphia
but
she
came
back
hurriedly
to
her
mother
i
have
had
a
delightful
call
she
said
but
perhaps
i
was
wrong
i
could
not
help
in
conversation
speaking
of
agamemnon
s
proposed
patent
i
ought
not
to
have
mentioned
it
as
such
things
are
kept
profound
secrets
they
say
women
always
do
tell
things
i
suppose
that
is
the
but
where
is
the
harm
asked
peterkin
i
m
sure
you
can
trust
the
lady
from
elizabeth
eliza
then
explained
that
the
lady
from
philadelphia
had
questioned
the
plan
a
little
when
it
was
told
her
and
had
suggested
that
if
everybody
had
the
same
key
there
would
be
no
particular
use
in
a
did
you
explain
to
her
said
peterkin
that
we
were
not
all
to
have
the
same
keys
i
couldn
t
quite
understand
her
said
elizabeth
eliza
but
she
seemed
to
think
that
burglars
and
other
people
might
come
in
if
the
keys
were
the
agamemnon
would
not
sell
his
patent
to
burglars
said
peterkin
indignantly
but
about
other
people
said
elizabeth
eliza
there
is
my
upper
drawer
the
little
boys
might
open
it
at
and
their
presents
in
it
and
i
am
not
sure
that
i
could
trust
amanda
said
peterkin
considering
both
she
and
elizabeth
eliza
felt
that
peterkin
ought
to
know
what
the
lady
from
philadelphia
had
suggested
elizabeth
eliza
then
proposed
going
into
town
but
it
would
take
so
long
she
might
not
reach
them
in
time
a
telegram
would
be
better
and
she
ventured
to
suggest
using
the
telegraph
alarm
for
on
moving
into
their
new
house
they
had
discovered
it
was
provided
with
all
the
modern
improvements
this
had
been
a
disappointment
to
peterkin
for
she
was
afraid
of
them
since
their
experience
the
last
winter
when
their
were
frozen
up
she
had
been
originally
attracted
to
the
house
by
an
old
pump
at
the
side
which
had
led
her
to
believe
there
were
no
modern
improvements
it
had
pleased
the
little
boys
too
they
liked
to
pump
the
handle
up
and
down
and
agreed
to
pump
all
the
water
needed
and
bring
it
into
the
house
there
was
an
old
well
with
a
picturesque
in
a
corner
by
the
barn
peterkin
was
frightened
by
this
at
first
she
was
afraid
the
little
boys
would
be
falling
in
every
day
and
they
showed
great
fondness
for
pulling
the
bucket
up
and
down
it
proved
however
that
the
well
was
dry
there
was
no
water
in
it
so
she
had
some
moss
thrown
down
and
an
old
for
safety
and
the
old
well
was
a
favorite
place
of
amusement
the
house
it
had
proved
was
well
furnished
with
and
waters
everywhere
and
all
over
the
house
and
a
and
with
a
little
knob
for
each
peterkin
was
very
anxious
she
feared
the
little
boys
would
be
summoning
somebody
all
the
time
and
it
was
decided
to
conceal
from
them
the
use
of
the
knobs
and
the
card
of
directions
at
the
side
was
destroyed
agamemnon
had
made
one
of
his
first
inventions
to
help
this
he
had
arranged
a
number
of
similar
knobs
to
be
put
in
rows
in
different
parts
of
the
house
to
appear
as
if
they
were
intended
for
ornament
and
had
added
some
to
the
original
knobs
peterkin
felt
more
secure
and
agamemnon
thought
of
taking
out
a
patent
for
this
invention
it
was
therefore
with
some
doubt
that
elizabeth
eliza
proposed
sending
a
telegram
to
her
father
peterkin
however
was
pleased
with
the
idea
solomon
john
was
out
and
the
little
boys
were
at
school
and
she
herself
would
touch
the
knob
while
elizabeth
eliza
should
write
the
telegram
i
think
it
is
the
fourth
knob
from
the
beginning
she
said
looking
at
one
of
the
rows
of
knobs
elizabeth
eliza
was
sure
of
this
agamemnon
she
believed
had
put
three
extra
knobs
at
each
end
but
which
is
the
end
and
which
is
the
beginning
the
top
or
the
bottom
peterkin
asked
hopelessly
still
she
bravely
selected
a
knob
and
elizabeth
eliza
hastened
with
her
to
look
out
for
the
messenger
how
soon
should
they
see
the
telegraph
boy
they
seemed
to
have
scarcely
reached
the
window
when
a
terrible
noise
was
heard
and
down
the
shady
street
the
white
horses
of
the
were
seen
rushing
at
a
fatal
speed
it
was
a
terrific
moment
i
have
touched
the
peterkin
exclaimed
both
rushed
to
open
the
front
door
in
agony
by
this
time
the
were
approaching
do
not
be
alarmed
said
the
chief
engineer
the
furniture
shall
be
carefully
covered
and
we
will
move
all
that
is
move
again
exclaimed
peterkin
in
agony
elizabeth
eliza
strove
to
explain
that
she
was
only
sending
a
telegram
to
her
father
who
was
in
boston
it
is
not
important
said
the
head
engineer
the
fire
will
all
be
out
before
it
could
reach
and
he
ran
upstairs
for
the
engines
were
beginning
to
play
upon
the
roof
peterkin
rushed
to
the
knobs
again
hurriedly
there
was
more
necessity
for
summoning
peterkin
home
write
a
telegram
to
your
father
she
said
to
elizabeth
eliza
to
come
home
that
will
take
but
three
words
said
elizabeth
eliza
with
presence
of
mind
and
we
need
ten
i
was
just
trying
to
make
them
what
has
come
now
exclaimed
peterkin
and
they
hurried
again
to
the
window
to
see
a
row
of
carriages
coming
down
the
street
i
must
have
touched
the
cried
peterkin
and
i
pushed
it
times
i
felt
so
anxious
six
hacks
stood
before
the
door
all
the
village
boys
were
assembling
even
their
own
little
boys
had
returned
from
school
and
were
showing
the
firemen
the
way
to
the
well
again
peterkin
rushed
to
the
knobs
and
a
fearful
sound
arose
she
had
touched
the
the
former
owner
of
the
house
who
had
a
great
fear
of
burglars
had
invented
a
machine
of
his
own
which
he
had
connected
with
a
knob
a
wire
attached
to
the
knob
moved
a
spring
that
could
put
in
motion
a
number
of
watchmen
s
rattles
hidden
under
the
eaves
of
the
piazza
all
these
were
now
set
and
their
terrible
din
roused
those
of
the
neighborhood
who
had
not
before
assembled
around
the
house
at
this
moment
elizabeth
eliza
met
the
chief
engineer
you
need
not
send
for
more
help
he
said
we
have
all
the
engines
in
town
here
and
have
stirred
up
all
the
towns
in
the
neighborhood
there
s
no
use
in
springing
any
more
alarms
i
can
t
find
the
fire
yet
but
we
have
water
pouring
all
over
the
elizabeth
eliza
waved
her
telegram
in
the
air
we
are
only
trying
to
send
a
telegram
to
my
father
and
brother
who
are
in
town
she
endeavored
to
explain
if
it
is
necessary
said
the
chief
engineer
you
might
send
it
down
in
one
of
the
hackney
carriages
i
see
a
number
standing
before
the
door
we
d
better
begin
to
move
the
heavier
furniture
and
some
of
you
women
might
fill
the
carriages
with
smaller
peterkin
was
ready
to
fall
into
hysterics
she
controlled
herself
with
a
supreme
power
and
hastened
to
touch
another
knob
elizabeth
eliza
corrected
her
telegram
and
decided
to
take
the
advice
of
the
chief
engineer
and
went
to
the
door
to
give
her
message
to
one
of
the
hackmen
when
she
saw
a
telegraph
boy
appear
her
mother
had
touched
the
right
knob
it
was
the
fourth
from
the
beginning
but
the
beginning
was
at
the
other
end
she
went
out
to
meet
the
boy
when
to
her
joy
she
saw
behind
him
her
father
and
agamemnon
she
clutched
her
telegram
and
hurried
toward
them
peterkin
was
bewildered
was
the
house
on
fire
if
so
where
were
the
flames
he
saw
the
row
of
carriages
was
there
a
funeral
or
a
wedding
who
was
dead
who
was
to
be
married
he
seized
the
telegram
that
elizabeth
eliza
reached
to
him
and
read
it
aloud
come
to
us
directly
the
house
is
not
on
fire
the
chief
engineer
was
standing
on
the
steps
the
house
not
on
fire
he
exclaimed
what
are
we
all
summoned
for
it
is
a
mistake
cried
elizabeth
eliza
wringing
her
hands
we
touched
the
wrong
knob
we
wanted
the
telegraph
boy
we
touched
all
the
wrong
knobs
exclaimed
peterkin
from
the
house
the
chief
engineer
turned
directly
to
give
with
a
few
exclamations
of
disgust
as
the
bells
of
distant
were
heard
approaching
solomon
john
appeared
at
this
moment
and
proposed
taking
one
of
the
carriages
and
going
for
a
doctor
for
his
mother
for
she
was
now
nearly
ready
to
fall
into
hysterics
and
agamemnon
thought
to
send
a
telegram
down
by
the
boy
for
the
evening
papers
to
announce
that
the
peterkins
house
had
not
been
on
fire
the
crisis
of
the
commotion
had
reached
its
height
the
beds
of
flowers
bordered
with
leaves
were
trodden
down
by
the
feet
of
the
crowd
that
had
assembled
the
chief
engineer
grew
more
and
more
indignant
as
he
sent
his
men
to
order
back
the
from
the
neighboring
towns
the
collection
of
boys
followed
the
procession
as
it
went
away
the
hastily
removed
covers
from
some
of
the
furniture
restored
the
rest
to
their
places
and
took
away
their
ladders
many
neighbors
remained
but
peterkin
hastened
into
the
house
to
attend
to
peterkin
elizabeth
eliza
took
an
opportunity
to
question
her
father
before
he
went
in
as
to
the
success
of
their
visit
to
town
we
saw
all
the
answered
peterkin
in
a
hollow
whisper
not
one
of
them
will
touch
the
patent
or
have
anything
to
do
with
elizabeth
eliza
looked
at
agamemnon
as
he
walked
silently
into
the
house
she
would
not
now
speak
to
him
of
the
patent
but
she
recalled
some
words
of
solomon
john
when
they
were
discussing
the
patent
he
had
said
that
many
an
inventor
had
grown
gray
before
his
discovery
was
acknowledged
by
the
public
others
might
reap
the
harvest
but
it
came
perhaps
only
when
he
was
going
to
his
grave
elizabeth
eliza
looked
at
agamemnon
reverently
and
followed
him
silently
into
the
house
agamemnon
s
career
there
had
apparently
been
some
mistake
in
agamemnon
s
education
he
had
been
to
a
number
of
colleges
indeed
but
he
had
never
completed
his
course
in
any
one
he
had
continually
fallen
into
some
difficulty
with
the
authorities
it
was
singular
for
he
was
of
an
inquiring
mind
and
had
always
tried
to
find
out
what
would
be
expected
of
him
but
had
never
hit
upon
the
right
thing
solomon
john
thought
the
trouble
might
be
in
what
they
called
the
elective
system
where
you
were
to
choose
what
study
you
might
take
this
had
always
bewildered
agamemnon
a
good
deal
and
how
was
a
feller
to
tell
solomon
john
had
asked
whether
he
wanted
to
study
a
thing
before
he
tried
it
it
might
turn
out
awful
hard
agamemnon
had
always
been
fond
of
reading
from
his
childhood
up
he
was
at
his
book
all
day
long
mrs
peterkin
had
imagined
he
would
come
out
a
great
scholar
because
she
could
never
get
him
away
from
his
books
and
so
it
was
in
his
colleges
he
was
always
to
be
found
in
the
library
reading
and
reading
but
they
were
always
the
wrong
books
for
instance
the
class
were
required
to
prepare
themselves
on
the
spartan
war
this
turned
agamemnon
s
attention
to
the
fenians
and
to
study
the
subject
he
read
up
on
charles
o
malley
and
harry
lorrequer
and
some
later
novels
of
that
sort
which
did
not
help
him
on
the
subject
required
yet
took
up
all
his
time
so
that
he
found
himself
unfitted
for
anything
else
when
the
examinations
came
in
consequence
he
was
requested
to
leave
agamemnon
always
missed
in
his
recitations
for
the
same
reason
that
elizabeth
eliza
did
not
get
on
in
school
because
he
was
always
asked
the
questions
he
did
not
know
it
seemed
provoking
if
the
professors
had
only
asked
something
else
but
they
always
hit
upon
the
very
things
he
had
not
studied
up
peterkin
felt
this
was
encouraging
for
agamemnon
knew
the
things
they
did
not
know
in
colleges
in
colleges
they
were
willing
to
take
for
students
only
those
who
already
knew
certain
things
she
thought
agamemnon
might
be
a
professor
in
a
college
for
those
students
who
didn
t
know
those
things
i
suppose
these
professors
could
not
have
known
a
great
deal
she
added
or
they
would
not
have
asked
you
so
many
questions
they
would
have
told
you
agamemnon
had
left
another
college
on
account
of
a
mistake
he
had
made
with
some
of
his
classmates
they
had
taken
a
great
deal
of
trouble
to
bring
some
wood
from
a
distant
to
make
a
bonfire
with
under
one
of
the
professors
windows
agamemnon
had
felt
it
would
be
a
compliment
to
the
professor
it
was
with
bonfires
that
heroes
had
been
greeted
on
their
return
from
successful
wars
in
this
way
had
been
kindled
upon
lofty
heights
that
had
inspired
mariners
seeking
their
homes
after
distant
adventures
as
he
plodded
back
and
forward
he
imagined
himself
some
hero
of
antiquity
he
was
reading
plutarch
s
lives
with
deep
interest
this
had
been
recommended
at
a
former
college
and
he
was
now
taking
it
up
in
the
midst
of
his
french
course
he
fancied
even
that
some
future
plutarch
was
growing
up
in
lynn
perhaps
who
would
write
of
this
night
of
suffering
and
glorify
its
heroes
for
himself
he
took
a
severe
cold
and
suffered
from
chilblains
in
consequence
of
going
back
and
forward
through
the
snow
carrying
the
wood
but
the
flames
of
the
bonfire
caught
the
blinds
of
the
professor
s
room
and
set
fire
to
the
building
and
came
near
burning
up
the
whole
institution
agamemnon
regretted
the
result
as
much
as
his
predecessor
who
gave
him
his
name
must
have
regretted
that
other
bonfire
on
the
shores
of
aulis
that
deprived
him
of
a
daughter
the
result
for
agamemnon
was
that
he
was
requested
to
leave
after
having
been
in
the
institution
but
a
few
months
he
left
another
college
in
consequence
of
a
misunderstanding
about
the
hour
for
morning
prayers
he
went
every
day
regularly
at
ten
o
clock
but
found
afterward
that
he
should
have
gone
at
six
this
hour
seemed
to
him
and
to
peterkin
unseasonable
at
a
time
of
year
when
the
sun
was
not
up
and
he
would
have
been
obliged
to
go
to
the
expense
of
candles
agamemnon
was
always
willing
to
try
another
college
wherever
he
could
be
admitted
he
wanted
to
attain
knowledge
however
it
might
be
found
but
after
going
to
five
and
leaving
each
before
the
year
was
out
he
gave
it
up
he
determined
to
lay
out
the
money
that
would
have
been
expended
in
a
collegiate
education
in
buying
an
encyclopædia
the
most
complete
that
he
could
find
and
to
spend
his
life
studying
it
systematically
he
would
not
content
himself
with
merely
reading
it
but
he
would
study
into
each
subject
as
it
came
up
and
perfect
himself
in
that
subject
by
the
time
then
that
he
had
finished
the
encyclopædia
he
should
have
embraced
all
knowledge
and
have
experienced
much
of
it
the
family
were
much
interested
in
this
plan
of
making
practice
of
every
subject
that
came
up
he
did
not
of
course
get
on
very
fast
in
this
way
in
the
second
column
of
the
very
first
page
he
met
with
a
as
a
note
in
music
this
led
him
to
the
study
of
music
he
bought
a
flute
and
took
some
lessons
and
attempted
to
accompany
elizabeth
eliza
on
the
piano
this
of
course
distracted
him
from
his
work
on
the
encyclopædia
but
he
did
not
wish
to
return
to
a
until
he
felt
perfect
in
music
this
required
a
long
time
then
in
this
same
paragraph
a
reference
was
made
in
it
he
was
requested
to
see
it
was
necessary
then
to
turn
to
this
was
about
the
time
the
family
were
moving
which
we
have
mentioned
when
the
difficult
subject
of
keys
came
up
that
suggested
to
him
his
own
simple
invention
and
the
hope
of
getting
a
patent
for
it
this
led
him
astray
as
inventions
before
have
done
with
so
that
he
was
drawn
aside
from
his
regular
study
the
family
however
were
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
career
agamemnon
had
chosen
it
would
help
them
all
in
any
path
of
life
if
he
should
master
the
encyclopædia
in
a
thorough
way
peterkin
agreed
it
would
in
the
end
be
not
as
expensive
as
a
college
course
even
if
agamemnon
should
buy
all
the
different
encyclopædias
that
appeared
there
would
be
no
spreads
involved
no
expense
of
receiving
friends
at
entertainments
in
college
he
could
live
at
home
so
that
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
fit
up
another
room
as
at
college
at
all
the
times
of
his
leaving
he
had
sold
out
favorably
to
other
occupants
solomon
john
s
destiny
was
more
uncertain
he
was
looking
forward
to
being
a
doctor
some
time
but
he
had
not
decided
whether
to
be
allopathic
or
homeopathic
or
whether
he
could
not
better
invent
his
own
pills
and
he
could
not
understand
how
to
obtain
his
doctor
s
degree
for
a
few
weeks
he
acted
as
clerk
in
a
druggist
s
store
but
he
could
serve
only
in
the
toothbrush
and
soap
department
because
it
was
found
he
was
not
familiar
enough
with
the
latin
language
to
compound
the
drugs
he
agreed
to
spend
his
evenings
in
studying
the
latin
grammar
but
his
course
was
interrupted
by
his
being
dismissed
for
treating
the
little
boys
too
frequently
to
soda
the
little
boys
were
going
through
the
schools
regularly
the
family
had
been
much
exercised
with
regard
to
their
education
elizabeth
eliza
felt
that
everything
should
be
expected
from
them
they
ought
to
take
advantage
from
the
family
mistakes
every
new
method
that
came
up
was
tried
upon
the
little
boys
they
had
been
taught
spelling
by
all
the
different
systems
and
were
just
able
to
read
when
peterkin
learned
that
it
was
now
considered
best
that
children
should
not
be
taught
to
read
till
they
were
ten
years
old
peterkin
was
in
despair
perhaps
if
their
books
were
taken
from
them
even
then
they
might
forget
what
they
had
learned
but
no
the
evil
was
done
the
brain
had
received
certain
impressions
that
could
not
be
blurred
over
this
was
long
ago
however
the
little
boys
had
since
entered
the
public
schools
they
went
also
to
a
gymnasium
and
a
whittling
school
and
joined
a
class
in
music
and
another
in
dancing
they
went
to
some
afternoon
lectures
for
children
when
there
was
no
other
school
and
belonged
to
a
still
peterkin
was
dissatisfied
by
the
slowness
of
their
progress
he
visited
the
schools
himself
and
found
that
they
did
not
lead
their
classes
it
seemed
to
him
a
great
deal
of
time
was
spent
in
things
that
were
not
instructive
such
as
putting
on
and
taking
off
their
boots
elizabeth
eliza
proposed
that
they
should
be
taken
from
school
and
taught
by
agamemnon
from
the
encyclopædia
the
rest
of
the
family
might
help
in
the
education
at
all
hours
of
the
day
solomon
john
could
take
up
the
latin
grammar
and
she
could
give
lessons
in
french
the
little
boys
were
enchanted
with
the
plan
only
they
did
not
want
to
have
the
all
the
time
peterkin
however
had
a
magnificent
idea
that
they
should
make
their
life
one
grand
object
lesson
they
should
begin
at
breakfast
and
study
everything
put
upon
the
table
the
material
of
which
it
was
made
and
where
it
came
from
in
the
study
of
the
letter
a
agamemnon
had
embraced
the
study
of
music
and
from
one
meal
they
might
gain
instruction
enough
for
a
day
we
shall
have
the
assistance
said
peterkin
of
agamemnon
with
his
agamemnon
modestly
suggested
that
he
had
not
yet
got
out
of
a
and
in
their
first
breakfast
everything
would
therefore
have
to
begin
with
a
that
would
not
be
impossible
said
peterkin
there
is
amanda
who
will
wait
on
table
to
start
with
we
could
have
suggested
solomon
john
peterkin
was
distressed
it
was
hard
enough
to
think
of
anything
for
breakfast
and
impossible
if
it
all
had
to
begin
with
one
letter
elizabeth
eliza
thought
it
would
not
be
necessary
all
they
were
to
do
was
to
ask
questions
as
in
examination
papers
and
find
their
answers
as
they
could
they
could
still
apply
to
the
encyclopædia
even
if
it
were
not
in
agamemnon
s
alphabetical
course
peterkin
suggested
a
great
variety
one
day
they
would
study
the
botany
of
the
another
day
its
natural
history
the
study
of
butter
would
include
that
of
the
cow
even
that
of
the
would
bring
in
geology
the
little
boys
were
charmed
at
the
idea
of
learning
pottery
from
the
and
they
were
promised
a
potter
s
wheel
directly
you
see
my
dear
said
peterkin
to
his
wife
before
many
weeks
we
shall
be
drinking
our
milk
from
jugs
made
by
our
elizabeth
eliza
hoped
for
a
thorough
study
yes
said
peterkin
we
might
begin
with
botany
that
would
be
near
to
agamemnon
alphabetically
we
ought
to
find
out
the
botany
of
butter
on
what
does
the
cow
feed
the
little
boys
were
eager
to
go
out
and
see
if
she
eats
clover
said
peterkin
we
shall
expect
the
botany
of
the
little
boys
insisted
that
they
were
to
begin
the
next
day
that
very
evening
they
should
go
out
and
study
the
cow
peterkin
sighed
and
decided
she
would
order
a
simple
breakfast
the
little
boys
took
their
and
pencils
and
clambered
upon
the
fence
where
they
seated
themselves
in
a
row
for
there
were
three
little
boys
so
it
was
now
supposed
they
were
always
coming
in
or
going
out
and
it
had
been
difficult
to
count
them
and
nobody
was
very
sure
how
many
there
were
there
they
sat
however
on
the
fence
looking
at
the
cow
she
looked
at
them
with
large
eyes
she
won
t
eat
they
cried
while
we
are
looking
at
her
so
they
turned
about
and
pretended
to
look
into
the
street
and
seated
themselves
that
way
turning
their
heads
back
from
time
to
time
to
see
the
cow
now
she
is
nibbling
a
no
that
is
a
bit
of
it
s
a
whole
handful
of
what
kind
of
grass
they
exclaimed
it
was
very
hard
sitting
with
their
backs
to
the
cow
and
pretending
to
the
cow
that
they
were
looking
into
the
street
and
yet
to
be
looking
at
the
cow
all
the
time
and
finding
out
what
she
was
eating
and
the
upper
rail
of
the
fence
was
narrow
and
a
little
sharp
it
was
very
high
too
for
some
additional
rails
had
been
put
on
to
prevent
the
cow
from
jumping
into
the
garden
or
street
suddenly
looking
out
into
the
hazy
twilight
elizabeth
eliza
saw
six
legs
and
six
boots
in
the
air
and
the
little
boys
disappeared
they
are
tossed
by
the
cow
the
little
boys
are
tossed
by
the
cow
peterkin
rushed
for
the
window
but
fainted
on
the
way
solomon
john
and
elizabeth
eliza
were
hurrying
to
the
door
but
stopped
not
knowing
what
to
do
next
peterkin
recovered
herself
with
a
supreme
effort
and
sent
them
out
to
the
rescue
but
what
could
they
do
the
fence
had
been
made
so
high
to
keep
the
cow
out
that
nobody
could
get
in
the
boy
that
did
the
milking
had
gone
off
with
the
key
of
the
outer
gate
and
perhaps
with
the
key
of
the
shed
door
even
if
that
were
not
locked
before
agamemnon
could
get
round
by
the
and
the
little
boys
might
be
gored
through
and
through
elizabeth
eliza
ran
to
the
neighbors
solomon
john
to
the
druggist
s
for
plasters
while
agamemnon
made
his
way
through
the
to
the
and
door
peterkin
mounted
the
outside
of
the
fence
while
peterkin
begged
him
not
to
put
himself
in
danger
he
climbed
high
enough
to
view
the
scene
he
held
to
the
corner
post
and
reported
what
he
saw
they
were
not
gored
the
cow
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
lot
one
of
the
little
boys
were
lying
in
a
bunch
of
dark
leaves
he
was
moving
the
cow
glared
but
did
not
stir
another
little
boy
was
pulling
his
boots
out
of
the
mud
the
cow
still
looked
at
him
another
was
feeling
the
top
of
his
head
the
cow
began
to
crop
the
grass
still
looking
at
him
agamemnon
had
reached
and
opened
the
the
little
boys
were
next
seen
running
toward
it
a
crowd
of
neighbors
with
pitchforks
had
returned
meanwhile
with
elizabeth
eliza
solomon
john
had
brought
four
druggists
but
by
the
time
they
had
reached
the
house
the
three
little
boys
were
safe
in
the
arms
of
their
mother
this
is
too
dangerous
a
form
of
education
she
cried
i
had
rather
they
went
to
no
they
bravely
cried
they
were
still
willing
to
try
the
other
way
the
educational
breakfast
peterkin
s
nerves
were
so
shaken
by
the
excitement
of
the
fall
of
the
three
little
boys
into
the
enclosure
where
the
cow
was
kept
that
the
educational
breakfast
was
long
postponed
the
little
boys
continued
at
school
as
before
and
the
conversation
dwelt
as
little
as
possible
upon
the
subject
of
education
peterkin
s
spirits
however
gradually
recovered
the
little
boys
were
allowed
to
watch
the
cow
at
her
feed
a
series
of
strings
were
arranged
by
agamemnon
and
solomon
john
by
which
the
little
boys
could
be
pulled
up
if
they
should
again
fall
down
into
the
enclosure
these
were
planned
something
like
and
solomon
john
frequently
amused
himself
by
pulling
one
of
the
little
boys
up
or
letting
him
down
some
conversation
did
again
fall
upon
the
old
difficulty
of
questions
elizabeth
eliza
declared
that
it
was
not
always
necessary
to
answer
that
many
who
could
did
not
answer
questions
the
conductors
of
the
railroads
for
instance
who
probably
knew
the
names
of
all
the
stations
on
a
road
but
were
seldom
able
to
tell
them
yes
said
agamemnon
one
might
be
a
conductor
without
even
knowing
the
names
of
the
stations
because
you
can
t
understand
them
when
they
do
tell
them
i
never
know
said
elizabeth
eliza
whether
it
is
ignorance
in
them
or
unwillingness
that
prevents
them
from
telling
you
how
soon
one
station
is
coming
or
how
long
you
are
to
stop
even
if
one
asks
ever
so
many
times
it
would
be
useful
if
they
would
peterkin
thought
this
was
carried
too
far
in
the
in
boston
the
conductors
had
always
left
you
as
far
as
possible
from
the
place
where
you
wanted
to
stop
but
it
seemed
a
little
too
much
to
have
the
aldermen
take
it
up
and
put
a
notice
in
the
cars
ordering
the
conductors
to
stop
at
the
farthest
peterkin
was
indeed
recovering
her
spirits
she
had
been
carrying
on
a
brisk
correspondence
with
philadelphia
that
she
had
imparted
to
no
one
and
at
last
she
announced
as
its
result
that
she
was
ready
for
a
breakfast
on
educational
principles
a
breakfast
indeed
when
it
appeared
peterkin
had
mistaken
the
alphabetical
suggestion
and
had
grasped
the
idea
that
the
whole
alphabet
must
be
represented
in
one
breakfast
this
therefore
was
the
bill
of
fare
bread
butter
coffee
cream
doughnuts
eggs
griddles
ham
ice
on
butter
jam
krout
sour
morning
newspapers
oatmeal
pepper
rolls
salt
tea
urn
waffles
peterkin
was
proud
and
astonished
excellent
he
cried
every
letter
represented
except
peterkin
drew
from
her
pocket
a
letter
from
the
lady
from
philadelphia
she
thought
you
would
call
it
for
x
and
she
tells
us
she
read
that
if
you
come
with
a
zest
you
will
bring
the
peterkin
was
enchanted
he
only
felt
that
he
ought
to
invite
the
children
in
the
primary
schools
to
such
a
breakfast
what
a
zest
indeed
it
would
give
to
the
study
of
their
letters
it
was
decided
to
begin
with
how
happy
exclaimed
peterkin
that
this
should
come
first
of
all
a
child
might
be
brought
up
on
till
he
had
mastered
the
first
letter
of
the
alphabet
and
could
go
on
to
the
more
involved
subjects
hidden
in
bread
butter
baked
beans
agamemnon
thought
his
father
hardly
knew
how
much
was
hidden
in
the
apple
there
was
all
the
story
of
william
tell
and
the
swiss
independence
the
little
boys
were
wild
to
act
william
tell
but
peterkin
was
afraid
of
the
arrows
peterkin
proposed
they
should
begin
by
eating
the
then
discussing
it
first
botanically
next
historically
or
perhaps
first
historically
beginning
with
adam
and
eve
and
the
first
apple
peterkin
feared
the
coffee
would
be
getting
cold
and
the
griddles
were
waiting
for
herself
she
declared
she
felt
more
at
home
on
the
marmalade
because
the
quinces
came
from
grandfather
s
and
she
had
seen
them
planted
she
remembered
all
about
it
and
now
the
bush
came
up
to
the
window
she
seemed
to
have
heard
him
tell
that
the
town
of
quincy
where
the
granite
came
from
was
named
from
them
and
she
never
quite
recollected
why
except
they
were
so
hard
as
hard
as
stone
and
it
took
you
almost
the
whole
day
to
stew
them
and
then
you
might
as
well
set
them
on
again
peterkin
was
glad
to
be
reminded
of
the
old
place
at
grandfather
s
in
order
to
know
thoroughly
about
apples
they
ought
to
understand
the
making
of
cider
now
they
might
some
time
drive
up
to
grandfather
s
scarcely
twelve
miles
away
and
see
the
cider
made
why
indeed
should
not
the
family
go
this
very
day
up
to
grandfather
s
and
continue
the
education
of
the
breakfast
why
not
indeed
exclaimed
the
little
boys
a
day
at
grandfather
s
would
give
them
the
whole
process
of
the
apple
from
the
orchard
to
the
in
this
way
they
could
widen
the
field
of
study
even
to
follow
in
time
the
cup
of
coffee
to
java
it
was
suggested
too
that
at
grandfather
s
they
might
study
the
processes
of
as
involved
in
the
agamemnon
pointed
out
the
connection
between
the
two
subjects
they
were
both
the
products
of
trees
the
and
the
maple
peterkin
proposed
that
the
lesson
for
the
day
should
be
considered
the
study
of
trees
and
on
the
way
they
could
look
at
other
trees
why
not
indeed
go
this
very
day
there
was
no
time
like
the
present
their
breakfast
had
been
so
copious
they
would
scarcely
be
in
a
hurry
for
dinner
and
would
therefore
have
the
whole
day
before
them
peterkin
could
put
up
the
remains
of
the
breakfast
for
luncheon
but
how
should
they
go
the
carryall
in
spite
of
its
name
could
hardly
take
the
whole
family
though
they
might
squeeze
in
six
as
the
little
boys
did
not
take
up
much
room
elizabeth
eliza
suggested
that
she
could
spend
the
night
at
grandfather
s
indeed
she
had
been
planning
a
visit
there
and
would
not
object
to
staying
some
days
this
would
make
it
easier
about
coming
home
but
it
did
not
settle
the
difficulty
in
getting
there
why
not
ride
and
tie
the
little
boys
were
fond
of
walking
so
was
peterkin
and
agamemnon
and
solomon
john
did
not
object
to
their
turn
peterkin
could
sit
in
the
carriage
when
it
was
waiting
for
the
pedestrians
to
come
up
or
she
said
she
did
not
object
to
a
little
turn
of
walking
peterkin
would
start
with
solomon
john
and
the
little
boys
before
the
rest
and
agamemnon
should
drive
his
mother
and
elizabeth
eliza
to
the
first
then
came
up
another
question
of
elizabeth
eliza
s
trunk
if
she
stayed
a
few
days
she
would
need
to
carry
something
it
might
be
hot
and
it
might
be
cold
just
as
soon
as
she
carried
her
thin
things
she
would
need
her
heaviest
wraps
you
never
could
depend
upon
the
weather
even
probabilities
got
you
no
farther
than
in
an
inspired
moment
elizabeth
eliza
bethought
herself
of
the
expressman
she
would
send
her
trunk
by
the
express
and
she
left
the
table
directly
to
go
and
pack
it
peterkin
busied
herself
with
amanda
over
the
remains
of
the
breakfast
peterkin
and
agamemnon
went
to
order
the
horse
and
the
expressman
and
solomon
john
and
the
little
boys
prepared
themselves
for
a
pedestrian
excursion
elizabeth
eliza
found
it
difficult
to
pack
in
a
hurry
there
were
so
many
things
she
might
want
and
then
again
she
might
not
she
must
put
up
her
music
because
her
grandfather
had
a
piano
and
then
she
bethought
herself
of
agamemnon
s
flute
and
decided
to
pick
out
a
volume
or
two
of
the
encyclopædia
but
it
was
hard
to
decide
all
by
herself
whether
to
take
g
for
or
m
for
or
t
for
tree
she
would
take
as
many
as
she
could
make
room
for
she
put
up
her
and
two
extra
and
she
must
take
some
french
books
she
had
never
yet
found
time
to
read
this
involved
taking
her
french
dictionary
as
she
doubted
if
her
grandfather
had
one
she
ought
to
put
in
a
botany
if
they
were
to
study
trees
but
she
could
not
tell
which
so
she
would
take
all
there
were
she
might
as
well
take
all
her
dresses
and
it
was
no
harm
if
one
had
too
many
wraps
when
she
had
her
trunk
packed
she
found
it
it
was
difficult
to
shut
it
she
had
heard
solomon
john
set
out
from
the
front
door
with
his
father
and
the
little
boys
and
agamemnon
was
busy
holding
the
horse
at
the
side
door
so
there
was
no
use
in
calling
for
help
she
got
upon
the
trunk
she
jumped
upon
it
she
sat
down
upon
it
and
leaning
over
found
she
could
lock
it
yes
it
was
really
locked
but
on
getting
down
from
the
trunk
she
found
her
dress
had
been
caught
in
the
lid
she
could
not
move
away
from
it
what
was
worse
she
was
so
fastened
to
the
trunk
that
she
could
not
lean
forward
far
enough
to
turn
the
key
back
to
unlock
the
trunk
and
release
herself
the
lock
had
slipped
easily
but
she
could
not
now
get
hold
of
the
key
in
the
right
way
to
turn
it
back
she
tried
to
pull
her
dress
away
no
it
was
caught
too
firmly
she
called
for
help
to
her
mother
or
amanda
to
come
and
open
the
trunk
but
her
door
was
shut
nobody
near
enough
to
hear
she
tried
to
pull
the
trunk
toward
the
door
to
open
it
and
make
herself
heard
but
it
was
so
heavy
that
in
her
constrained
position
she
could
not
stir
it
in
her
agony
she
would
have
been
willing
to
have
torn
her
dress
but
it
was
her
and
too
stout
to
tear
she
might
cut
it
carefully
alas
she
had
packed
her
scissors
and
her
knife
she
had
lent
to
the
little
boys
the
day
before
she
called
again
what
silence
there
was
in
the
house
her
voice
seemed
to
echo
through
the
room
at
length
as
she
listened
she
heard
the
sound
of
wheels
was
it
the
carriage
rolling
away
from
the
side
door
did
she
hear
the
front
door
shut
she
remembered
then
that
amanda
was
to
have
the
but
she
elizabeth
eliza
was
to
have
spoken
to
amanda
to
explain
to
her
to
wait
for
the
expressman
she
was
to
have
told
her
as
she
went
downstairs
but
she
had
not
been
able
to
go
downstairs
and
amanda
must
have
supposed
that
all
the
family
had
left
and
she
too
must
have
gone
knowing
of
the
expressman
yes
she
heard
the
wheels
she
heard
the
front
door
shut
but
could
they
have
gone
without
her
then
she
recalled
that
she
had
proposed
walking
on
a
little
way
with
solomon
john
and
her
father
to
be
picked
up
by
peterkin
if
she
should
have
finished
her
packing
in
time
her
mother
must
have
supposed
that
she
had
done
so
that
she
had
spoken
to
amanda
and
started
with
the
rest
well
she
would
soon
discover
her
mistake
she
would
overtake
the
walking
party
and
not
finding
elizabeth
eliza
would
return
for
her
patience
only
was
needed
she
had
looked
around
for
something
to
read
but
she
had
packed
up
all
her
books
she
had
packed
her
knitting
how
quiet
and
still
it
was
she
tried
to
imagine
where
her
mother
would
meet
the
rest
of
the
family
they
were
good
walkers
and
they
might
have
reached
the
bridge
but
suppose
they
should
stop
for
water
beneath
the
arch
of
the
bridge
as
they
often
did
and
the
carryall
pass
over
it
without
seeing
them
her
mother
would
not
know
but
she
was
with
them
and
suppose
her
mother
should
decide
to
leave
the
horse
at
the
place
proposed
for
stopping
and
waiting
for
the
first
pedestrian
party
and
herself
walk
on
no
one
would
be
left
to
tell
the
rest
when
they
should
come
up
to
the
carryall
they
might
go
on
so
through
the
whole
journey
without
meeting
and
she
might
not
be
missed
till
they
should
reach
her
grandfather
s
horrible
thought
she
would
be
left
here
alone
all
day
the
expressman
would
come
but
the
expressman
would
go
for
he
would
not
be
able
to
get
into
the
house
she
thought
of
the
terrible
story
of
ginevra
of
the
bride
who
was
shut
up
in
her
trunk
and
forever
she
was
shut
up
on
hers
and
knew
not
when
she
should
be
released
she
had
acted
once
in
the
ballad
of
the
mistletoe
she
had
been
one
of
the
guests
who
had
sung
oh
the
mistletoe
bough
and
had
looked
up
at
it
and
she
had
seen
at
the
how
the
bride
had
laughingly
stepped
into
the
trunk
but
the
trunk
then
was
only
a
of
some
boards
in
front
of
a
sofa
and
this
was
a
stern
reality
it
would
be
late
now
before
her
family
would
reach
her
grandfather
s
perhaps
they
would
decide
to
spend
the
night
perhaps
they
would
fancy
she
was
coming
by
express
she
gave
another
tremendous
effort
to
move
the
trunk
toward
the
door
in
vain
all
was
still
meanwhile
peterkin
sat
some
time
at
the
door
wondering
why
elizabeth
eliza
did
not
come
down
peterkin
had
started
on
with
solomon
john
and
all
the
little
boys
agamemnon
had
packed
the
things
into
the
carriage
a
basket
of
lunch
a
change
of
shoes
for
peterkin
some
extra
wraps
everything
peterkin
could
think
of
for
the
family
comfort
still
elizabeth
eliza
did
not
come
i
think
she
must
have
walked
on
with
your
father
she
said
at
last
you
had
better
get
agamemnon
now
got
in
i
should
think
she
would
have
mentioned
it
she
continued
but
we
may
as
well
start
on
and
pick
her
up
they
started
off
i
hope
elizabeth
eliza
thought
to
speak
to
amanda
but
we
must
ask
her
when
we
come
up
with
but
they
did
not
come
up
with
elizabeth
eliza
at
the
turn
beyond
the
village
they
found
an
envelope
struck
up
in
an
inviting
manner
against
a
tree
in
this
way
they
had
agreed
to
leave
missives
for
each
other
as
they
passed
on
this
note
informed
them
that
the
walking
party
was
going
to
take
the
short
cut
across
the
meadows
and
would
still
be
in
front
of
them
they
saw
the
party
at
last
just
beyond
the
short
cut
but
peterkin
was
explaining
the
character
of
the
to
his
children
as
they
stood
around
a
large
specimen
i
suppose
he
is
telling
them
that
it
is
some
kind
of
a
quercus
said
agamemnon
thoughtfully
peterkin
thought
peterkin
would
scarcely
use
such
an
expression
but
she
could
see
nothing
of
elizabeth
eliza
some
of
the
party
however
were
behind
the
tree
some
were
in
front
and
elizabeth
eliza
might
be
behind
the
tree
they
were
too
far
off
to
be
shouted
at
peterkin
was
calmed
and
went
on
to
the
agreed
upon
which
they
reached
before
long
this
had
been
appointed
near
farmer
gordon
s
barn
that
there
might
be
somebody
at
hand
whom
they
knew
in
case
there
should
be
any
difficulty
in
untying
the
horse
the
plan
had
been
that
peterkin
should
always
sit
in
the
carriage
while
the
others
should
take
turns
for
walking
and
agamemnon
tied
the
horse
to
a
fence
and
left
her
comfortably
arranged
with
her
knitting
indeed
she
had
risen
so
early
to
prepare
for
the
alphabetical
breakfast
and
had
since
been
so
tired
with
preparations
that
she
was
quite
sleepy
and
would
not
object
to
a
nape
in
the
shade
by
the
soothing
sound
of
the
buzzing
of
the
flies
but
she
called
agamemnon
back
as
he
started
off
for
his
solitary
walk
with
a
perplexing
question
suppose
the
rest
all
should
arrive
how
could
they
now
be
accommodated
in
the
carryall
it
would
be
too
much
for
the
horse
why
had
elizabeth
eliza
gone
with
the
rest
without
counting
up
of
course
they
must
have
expected
that
she
peterkin
would
walk
on
to
the
next
place
she
decided
there
was
no
way
but
for
her
to
walk
on
when
the
rest
passed
her
they
might
make
a
change
so
she
put
up
knitting
cheerfully
it
was
a
little
joggly
in
the
carriage
she
had
already
found
for
the
horse
was
restless
from
the
flies
and
she
did
not
like
being
left
alone
she
walked
on
then
with
agamemnon
it
was
very
pleasant
at
first
but
the
sun
became
hot
and
it
was
not
long
before
she
was
fatigued
when
they
reached
a
she
proposed
going
in
to
rest
upon
one
of
the
the
largest
and
most
shady
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
field
and
they
were
seated
there
when
the
carryall
passed
them
in
the
road
peterkin
waved
parasol
and
hat
and
the
party
in
the
carryall
returned
their
greetings
but
they
were
too
far
apart
to
hear
each
other
peterkin
and
agamemnon
slowly
resumed
their
walk
well
we
shall
find
elizabeth
eliza
in
the
carryall
she
said
and
that
will
explain
but
it
took
them
an
hour
or
two
to
reach
the
carryall
with
frequent
stoppings
for
rest
and
when
they
reached
it
no
one
was
in
it
a
note
was
pinned
up
in
the
vehicle
to
say
they
had
all
walked
on
it
was
prime
in
this
way
the
parties
continued
to
dodge
each
other
for
peterkin
felt
that
she
must
walk
on
from
the
next
station
and
the
carryall
missed
her
again
while
she
and
agamemnon
stopped
in
a
house
to
rest
and
for
a
glass
of
water
she
reached
the
carryall
to
find
again
that
no
one
was
in
it
the
party
had
passed
on
for
the
last
station
where
it
had
been
decided
all
should
meet
at
the
foot
of
grandfather
s
hill
that
they
might
all
arrive
at
the
house
together
peterkin
and
agamemnon
looked
out
eagerly
for
the
party
all
the
way
as
elizabeth
eliza
must
be
tired
by
this
time
but
peterkin
s
last
walk
had
been
so
slow
that
the
other
party
was
far
in
advance
and
reached
the
before
them
the
little
boys
were
all
rowed
out
on
the
stone
fence
awaiting
them
full
of
delight
at
having
reached
grandfather
s
peterkin
came
forward
to
meet
them
and
at
the
same
moment
with
peterkin
exclaimed
where
is
elizabeth
eliza
each
party
looked
eagerly
at
the
other
no
elizabeth
eliza
was
to
be
seen
where
was
she
what
was
to
be
done
was
she
left
behind
peterkin
was
convinced
she
must
have
somehow
got
to
grandfather
s
they
hurried
up
the
hill
grandfather
and
all
the
family
came
out
to
greet
them
for
they
had
been
seen
approaching
there
was
great
questioning
but
no
elizabeth
eliza
it
was
sunset
the
view
was
wide
and
fine
and
peterkin
stood
and
looked
out
from
the
north
to
the
south
was
it
too
late
to
send
back
for
elizabeth
eliza
where
was
she
meanwhile
the
little
boys
had
been
informing
the
family
of
the
object
of
their
visit
and
while
and
peterkin
were
looking
up
and
down
the
road
and
agamemnon
and
solomon
john
were
explaining
to
each
other
the
details
of
their
journeys
they
had
discovered
some
facts
we
shall
have
to
go
back
they
exclaimed
we
are
too
late
the
was
all
made
last
we
are
too
early
we
shall
have
to
stay
two
or
three
months
the
cider
is
not
made
till
the
expedition
was
a
failure
they
could
study
the
making
of
neither
nor
cider
and
elizabeth
eliza
was
lost
perhaps
forever
the
sun
went
down
and
and
peterkin
still
stood
to
look
up
and
down
the
road
elizabeth
eliza
meanwhile
had
sat
upon
her
trunk
as
it
seemed
for
ages
she
recalled
all
the
terrible
stories
of
prisoners
how
they
had
watched
the
growth
of
flowers
through
cracks
in
the
pavement
she
wondered
how
long
she
could
live
without
eating
how
thankful
she
was
for
her
abundant
breakfast
at
length
she
heard
the
but
who
could
go
to
the
door
to
answer
it
in
vain
did
she
make
another
effort
to
escape
it
was
impossible
how
singular
there
were
footsteps
some
one
was
going
to
the
door
some
one
had
opened
it
they
must
be
well
perhaps
that
was
a
better
fate
to
be
gagged
by
burglars
and
the
neighbors
informed
than
to
be
forever
locked
on
her
trunk
the
steps
approached
the
door
it
opened
and
amanda
ushered
in
the
expressman
amanda
had
not
gone
she
had
gathered
while
waiting
at
the
that
there
was
to
be
an
expressman
whom
she
must
receive
elizabeth
eliza
explained
the
situation
the
expressman
turned
the
key
of
her
trunk
and
she
was
released
what
should
she
do
next
so
long
a
time
had
elapsed
she
had
given
up
all
hope
of
her
family
returning
for
her
but
how
could
she
reach
them
she
hastily
prevailed
upon
the
expressman
to
take
her
along
until
she
should
come
up
with
some
of
the
family
at
least
she
would
fall
in
with
either
the
walking
party
or
the
carryall
or
she
would
meet
them
if
they
were
on
their
return
she
mounted
the
seat
with
the
expressman
and
slowly
they
took
their
way
stopping
for
occasional
parcels
as
they
left
the
village
but
much
to
elizabeth
eliza
s
dismay
they
turned
off
from
the
main
road
on
leaving
the
village
she
remonstrated
but
the
driver
insisted
he
must
go
round
by
millikin
s
to
leave
a
bedstead
they
went
round
by
millikin
s
and
then
had
further
turns
to
make
elizabeth
eliza
explained
that
in
this
way
it
would
be
impossible
for
her
to
find
her
parents
and
family
and
at
last
he
proposed
to
take
her
all
the
way
with
her
trunk
she
remembered
with
a
shudder
that
when
she
had
first
asked
about
her
trunk
he
had
promised
it
should
certainly
be
delivered
the
next
morning
suppose
they
should
have
to
be
out
all
night
where
did
spend
the
night
she
thought
of
herself
in
a
lone
wood
in
an
she
could
hardly
bring
herself
to
ask
before
assenting
when
he
should
arrive
he
guessed
he
could
bring
up
before
and
so
it
happened
that
as
and
peterkin
in
the
late
sunset
were
looking
down
the
hill
wondering
what
they
should
do
about
the
lost
elizabeth
eliza
they
saw
an
express
wagon
approaching
a
female
form
sat
upon
the
front
seat
she
has
decided
to
come
by
express
said
peterkin
it
is
it
is
elizabeth
eliza
the
peterkins
at
the
carnival
of
authors
in
boston
the
peterkins
were
in
quite
a
muddle
for
them
about
the
carnival
of
authors
to
be
given
in
boston
as
soon
as
it
was
announced
their
interests
were
excited
and
they
determined
that
all
the
family
should
go
but
they
conceived
a
wrong
idea
of
the
entertainment
as
they
supposed
that
every
one
must
go
in
costume
elizabeth
eliza
thought
their
lessons
in
the
foreign
languages
would
help
them
much
in
conversing
in
character
as
the
carnival
was
announced
early
solomon
john
thought
there
would
be
time
to
read
up
everything
written
by
all
the
authors
in
order
to
be
acquainted
with
the
characters
they
introduced
peterkin
did
not
wish
to
begin
too
early
upon
the
reading
for
she
was
sure
she
should
forget
all
that
the
different
authors
had
written
before
the
day
came
but
elizabeth
eliza
declared
that
she
should
hardly
have
time
enough
as
it
was
to
be
acquainted
with
all
the
authors
she
had
given
up
her
french
lessons
after
taking
six
for
want
of
time
and
had
indeed
concluded
she
had
learned
in
them
all
she
should
need
to
know
of
that
language
she
could
repeat
one
or
two
pages
of
phrases
and
she
was
astonished
to
find
how
much
she
could
understand
already
of
what
the
french
teacher
said
to
her
and
he
assured
her
that
when
she
went
to
paris
she
could
at
least
ask
the
price
of
gloves
or
of
some
other
things
she
would
need
and
he
taught
her
too
how
to
pronounce
garçon
in
calling
for
more
agamemnon
thought
that
different
members
of
the
family
might
make
themselves
familiar
with
different
authors
the
little
boys
were
already
acquainted
with
mother
peterkin
had
read
the
pickwick
papers
and
solomon
john
had
actually
seen
longfellow
getting
into
a
elizabeth
eliza
suggested
that
they
might
ask
the
turk
to
give
lectures
upon
the
arabian
everybody
else
was
planning
something
of
the
sort
to
raise
funds
for
some
purpose
and
she
was
sure
they
ought
not
to
be
behindhand
peterkin
approved
of
this
it
would
be
excellent
if
they
could
raise
funds
enough
to
pay
for
their
own
tickets
to
the
carnival
then
they
could
go
every
night
elizabeth
eliza
was
uncertain
she
thought
it
was
usual
to
use
the
funds
for
some
object
peterkin
said
that
if
they
gained
funds
enough
they
might
arrange
a
booth
of
their
own
and
sit
in
it
and
take
the
carnival
comfortably
but
agamemnon
reminded
him
that
none
of
the
family
were
authors
and
only
authors
had
booths
solomon
john
indeed
had
once
started
upon
writing
a
book
but
he
was
not
able
to
think
of
anything
to
put
in
it
and
nothing
had
occurred
to
him
yet
peterkin
urged
him
to
make
one
more
effort
if
his
book
could
come
out
before
the
carnival
he
could
go
as
an
author
and
might
have
a
booth
of
his
own
and
take
his
family
but
agamemnon
declared
it
would
take
years
to
become
an
author
you
might
indeed
publish
something
but
you
had
to
make
sure
that
it
would
be
read
peterkin
on
the
other
hand
was
certain
that
libraries
were
filled
with
books
that
never
were
read
yet
authors
had
written
them
for
herself
she
had
not
read
half
the
books
in
their
own
library
and
she
was
glad
there
was
to
be
a
carnival
of
authors
that
she
might
know
who
they
were
peterkin
did
not
understand
why
they
called
them
a
carnival
but
he
supposed
they
should
find
out
when
they
went
to
it
peterkin
still
felt
uncertain
about
costumes
she
proposed
looking
over
the
old
trunks
in
the
garret
they
would
find
some
suitable
dresses
there
and
these
would
suggest
what
characters
they
should
take
elizabeth
eliza
was
pleased
with
this
thought
she
remembered
an
old
turban
of
white
mull
muslin
in
an
old
bandbox
and
why
should
not
her
mother
wear
it
peterkin
supposed
that
she
should
then
go
as
her
own
grandmother
agamemnon
did
not
approve
of
this
turbans
are
now
worn
in
the
east
and
peterkin
could
go
in
some
eastern
character
solomon
john
thought
she
might
be
cleopatra
and
this
was
determined
on
among
the
treasures
found
were
some
old
bonnets
of
large
size
with
waving
plumes
elizabeth
eliza
decided
upon
the
largest
of
these
she
was
tempted
to
appear
as
columbus
as
solomon
john
was
to
take
the
character
of
christopher
columbus
but
he
was
planning
to
enter
upon
the
stage
in
a
boat
and
elizabeth
eliza
was
a
little
afraid
of
as
he
had
arranged
to
be
a
great
while
finding
the
shore
solomon
john
had
been
led
to
take
this
character
by
discovering
a
that
would
answer
for
a
helmet
then
as
christopher
columbus
was
born
in
genoa
he
could
use
the
phrases
in
italian
he
had
lately
learned
of
his
teacher
as
the
day
approached
the
family
had
their
costumes
prepared
peterkin
decided
to
be
peter
the
great
it
seemed
to
him
a
happy
thought
for
the
few
words
of
russian
he
had
learned
would
come
in
play
and
he
was
quite
sure
that
his
own
family
name
made
him
kin
to
that
of
the
great
czar
he
studied
up
the
life
in
the
encyclopædia
and
decided
to
take
the
costume
of
a
he
visited
the
and
some
of
the
docks
but
none
of
them
gave
him
the
true
idea
of
dress
for
in
holland
or
petersburg
but
he
found
a
picture
of
peter
the
great
representing
him
in
a
hat
so
he
assumed
one
that
he
found
at
a
costumer
s
and
with
elizabeth
eliza
s
black
waterproof
was
satisfied
with
his
own
appearance
elizabeth
eliza
wondered
if
she
could
not
go
with
her
father
in
some
russian
character
she
would
have
to
lay
aside
her
large
bonnet
but
she
had
seen
pictures
of
russian
ladies
with
fur
muffs
on
their
heads
and
she
might
wear
her
own
muff
peterkin
as
cleopatra
wore
the
turban
with
a
little
row
of
false
curls
in
front
and
a
white
embroidered
muslin
shawl
crossed
over
her
black
silk
dress
the
little
boys
thought
she
looked
much
like
the
picture
of
their
but
doubtless
cleopatra
resembled
this
picture
as
it
was
all
so
long
ago
so
the
rest
of
the
family
decided
agamemnon
determined
to
go
as
noah
the
costume
as
represented
in
one
of
the
little
boys
arks
was
simple
his
father
s
dressing
gown
turned
inside
out
permitted
it
easily
elizabeth
eliza
was
now
anxious
to
be
shem
and
make
a
long
dress
of
yellow
flannel
and
appear
with
agamemnon
and
the
little
boys
for
the
little
boys
were
to
represent
two
doves
and
a
raven
there
were
enough
in
the
family
for
their
costumes
which
would
be
then
complete
with
their
boots
solomon
john
carried
out
in
detail
his
idea
of
christopher
columbus
he
had
a
number
of
eggs
boiled
hard
to
take
in
his
pocket
proposing
to
repeat
through
the
evening
the
scene
of
setting
the
egg
on
its
end
he
gave
up
the
plan
of
a
boat
as
it
must
be
difficult
to
carry
one
into
town
so
he
contented
himself
by
practising
the
motion
of
landing
by
stepping
up
on
a
chair
but
what
scene
could
elizabeth
eliza
carry
out
if
they
had
an
ark
as
shem
she
might
crawl
in
and
out
of
the
roof
constantly
if
it
were
not
too
high
but
peterkin
thought
it
as
difficult
to
take
an
ark
into
town
as
solomon
john
s
boat
the
evening
came
but
with
all
their
preparations
they
got
to
the
hall
late
the
entrance
was
filled
with
a
crowd
of
people
and
as
they
stopped
at
the
cloakroom
to
leave
their
wraps
they
found
themselves
entangled
with
a
number
of
people
in
costume
coming
out
from
a
below
peterkin
was
much
encouraged
they
were
thus
joining
the
performers
the
band
was
playing
the
wedding
march
as
they
went
upstairs
to
a
door
of
the
hall
which
opened
upon
one
side
of
the
stage
here
a
procession
was
marching
up
the
steps
of
the
stage
all
in
costume
and
entering
behind
the
scenes
we
are
just
in
the
right
time
whispered
peterkin
to
his
family
they
are
going
upon
the
stage
we
must
fall
into
the
little
boys
had
their
ready
some
words
from
one
of
the
managers
made
peterkin
understand
the
situation
we
are
going
to
be
introduced
to
dickens
he
said
i
thought
he
was
dead
exclaimed
peterkin
trembling
authors
live
forever
said
agamemnon
in
her
ear
at
this
moment
they
were
ushered
upon
the
stage
the
stage
manager
glared
at
them
as
he
awaited
their
names
for
introduction
while
they
came
up
all
unannounced
a
part
of
the
programme
not
expected
but
he
uttered
the
words
upon
his
lips
great
expectations
and
the
peterkin
family
swept
across
the
stage
with
the
rest
peterkin
costumed
as
peter
the
great
peterkin
as
cleopatra
agamemnon
as
noah
solomon
john
as
christopher
columbus
elizabeth
eliza
in
yellow
flannel
as
shem
with
a
large
bonnet
on
her
head
as
columbus
and
the
little
boys
behind
as
two
doves
and
a
raven
across
the
stage
in
face
of
all
the
assembled
people
then
following
the
rest
down
the
stairs
on
the
other
side
in
among
the
audience
they
went
but
into
an
audience
not
dressed
in
costume
there
were
ann
maria
bromwick
and
the
osbornes
all
the
neighbors
all
as
natural
as
though
they
were
walking
the
streets
at
home
though
ann
maria
did
wear
white
gloves
i
had
no
idea
you
were
to
appear
in
character
said
ann
maria
to
elizabeth
eliza
to
what
booth
do
you
belong
we
are
no
particular
author
said
peterkin
ah
i
see
a
sort
of
varieties
booth
said
osborne
what
is
your
character
asked
ann
maria
of
elizabeth
eliza
i
have
not
quite
decided
said
elizabeth
eliza
i
thought
i
should
find
out
after
i
came
here
the
marshal
called
us
great
peterkin
was
at
the
summit
of
bliss
i
have
shaken
hands
with
dickens
she
exclaimed
but
she
looked
round
to
ask
the
little
boys
if
they
too
had
shaken
hands
with
the
great
man
but
not
a
little
boy
could
she
find
they
had
been
swept
off
in
mother
goose
s
train
which
had
lingered
on
the
steps
to
see
the
dickens
reception
with
which
the
procession
of
characters
in
costume
had
closed
at
this
moment
they
were
dancing
round
the
barberry
bush
in
a
corner
of
the
balcony
in
mother
goose
s
quarters
their
gayly
waving
in
the
air
but
peterkin
far
below
could
not
see
this
and
consoled
herself
with
the
thought
they
should
all
meet
on
the
stage
in
the
grand
closing
tableau
she
was
bewildered
by
the
crowds
which
swept
her
hither
and
thither
at
last
she
found
herself
in
the
whittier
booth
and
sat
a
long
time
calmly
there
as
cleopatra
she
seemed
out
of
place
but
as
her
own
grandmother
she
answered
well
with
its
new
england
scenery
solomon
john
wandered
about
landing
in
america
whenever
he
found
a
chance
to
enter
a
booth
once
before
an
admiring
audience
he
set
up
his
egg
in
the
centre
of
the
goethe
booth
which
had
been
deserted
by
its
committee
for
the
larger
stage
agamemnon
frequently
stood
in
the
background
of
scenes
in
the
arabian
nights
it
was
with
difficulty
that
the
family
could
be
repressed
from
going
on
the
stage
whenever
the
bugle
sounded
for
the
different
groups
represented
there
elizabeth
eliza
came
near
appearing
in
the
dream
of
fair
women
at
its
most
culminating
point
peterkin
found
himself
with
the
cricket
on
the
hearth
in
the
dickens
booth
he
explained
that
he
was
peter
the
great
but
always
in
the
russian
language
which
was
never
understood
elizabeth
eliza
found
herself
in
turn
in
all
the
booths
every
manager
was
puzzled
by
her
appearance
and
would
send
her
to
some
other
and
she
passed
along
always
trying
to
explain
that
she
had
not
yet
decided
upon
her
character
peterkin
came
and
took
cleopatra
from
the
whittier
booth
i
can
not
understand
he
said
why
none
of
our
friends
are
dressed
in
costume
and
why
we
i
rather
like
it
said
elizabeth
eliza
though
i
should
be
better
pleased
if
i
could
form
a
group
with
some
the
strains
of
the
minuet
began
peterkin
was
anxious
to
join
the
performers
it
was
the
dance
of
her
youth
but
she
was
delayed
by
one
of
the
managers
on
the
steps
that
led
to
the
stage
i
can
not
understand
this
company
he
said
distractedly
they
can
not
find
their
booth
said
another
that
is
the
case
said
peterkin
relieved
to
have
it
stated
perhaps
you
had
better
pass
into
the
corridor
said
a
polite
marshal
they
did
this
and
walking
across
found
themselves
in
the
this
is
the
booth
for
us
said
peterkin
indeed
it
is
said
peterkin
sinking
into
a
chair
exhausted
at
this
moment
two
doves
and
a
raven
appeared
the
little
boys
who
had
been
dancing
eagerly
in
mother
goose
s
establishment
and
now
came
down
for
i
hardly
know
how
to
sit
down
said
elizabeth
eliza
for
i
am
sure
shem
never
could
still
as
i
do
not
know
if
i
am
shem
i
will
venture
happily
seats
were
to
be
found
for
all
and
they
were
soon
arranged
in
a
row
calmly
eating
i
think
the
truth
is
said
peterkin
that
we
represent
historical
people
and
we
ought
to
have
been
fictitious
characters
in
books
that
is
i
observe
what
the
others
are
we
shall
know
better
another
if
we
only
ever
get
home
said
peterkin
i
shall
not
wish
to
come
again
it
seems
like
being
on
the
stage
sitting
in
a
booth
and
it
is
so
bewildering
elizabeth
eliza
not
knowing
who
she
is
and
going
round
and
round
in
this
i
am
afraid
we
shall
never
reach
home
said
agamemnon
who
had
been
silent
for
some
time
we
may
have
to
spend
the
night
here
i
find
i
have
lost
our
checks
for
our
clothes
in
the
spend
the
night
in
a
booth
in
cleopatra
s
turban
exclaimed
peterkin
we
should
like
to
come
every
night
cried
the
little
boys
but
to
spend
the
night
repeated
peterkin
i
conclude
the
carnival
keeps
up
all
night
said
peterkin
but
never
to
recover
our
cloaks
said
peterkin
could
not
the
little
boys
look
round
for
the
checks
on
the
floors
she
began
to
enumerate
the
many
valuable
things
that
they
might
never
see
again
she
had
worn
her
large
fur
cape
of
her
grandmother
s
that
elizabeth
eliza
had
been
urging
her
to
have
made
into
a
now
how
she
wished
she
had
and
there
were
peterkin
s
new
overshoes
and
agamemnon
had
brought
an
umbrella
and
the
little
boys
had
their
mittens
their
boots
fortunately
they
had
on
in
the
character
of
birds
but
solomon
john
had
worn
a
fur
cap
and
elizabeth
eliza
a
muff
should
they
lose
all
these
valuables
entirely
and
go
home
in
the
cold
without
them
no
it
would
be
better
to
wait
till
everybody
had
gone
and
then
look
carefully
over
the
floors
for
the
checks
if
only
the
little
boys
could
know
where
agamemnon
had
been
they
were
willing
to
look
peterkin
was
not
sure
as
they
would
have
time
to
reach
the
train
still
they
would
need
something
to
wear
and
he
could
not
tell
the
time
he
had
not
brought
his
watch
it
was
a
waltham
watch
and
he
thought
it
would
not
be
in
character
for
peter
the
great
to
wear
it
at
this
moment
the
strains
of
home
sweet
home
were
heard
from
the
band
and
people
were
seen
preparing
to
go
all
can
go
home
but
we
must
stay
said
peterkin
gloomily
as
the
strains
floated
in
from
the
larger
hall
a
number
of
marshals
came
to
the
looked
at
them
whispered
to
each
other
as
the
peterkins
sat
in
a
row
can
we
do
anything
for
you
asked
one
at
last
would
you
not
like
to
go
he
seemed
eager
they
should
leave
the
room
peterkin
explained
that
they
could
not
go
as
they
had
lost
the
checks
for
their
wraps
and
hoped
to
find
their
checks
on
the
floor
when
everybody
was
gone
the
marshal
asked
if
they
could
not
describe
what
they
had
worn
in
which
case
the
loss
of
the
checks
was
not
so
important
as
the
crowds
had
now
almost
left
and
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
identify
their
wraps
peterkin
eagerly
declared
she
could
describe
every
article
it
was
astonishing
how
the
marshals
hurried
them
through
the
quickly
deserted
corridors
how
gladly
they
recovered
their
garments
peterkin
indeed
was
disturbed
by
the
eagerness
of
the
marshals
she
feared
they
had
some
pretext
for
getting
the
family
out
of
the
hall
peterkin
was
one
of
those
who
never
consent
to
be
forced
to
anything
she
would
not
be
compelled
to
go
home
even
with
strains
of
music
she
whispered
her
suspicions
to
peterkin
but
agamemnon
came
hastily
up
to
announce
the
time
which
he
had
learned
from
the
clock
in
the
large
hall
they
must
leave
directly
if
they
wished
to
catch
the
latest
train
as
there
was
barely
time
to
reach
it
then
indeed
was
peterkin
ready
to
leave
if
they
should
miss
the
train
if
she
should
have
to
pass
the
night
in
the
streets
in
her
turban
she
was
the
first
to
lead
the
way
and
panting
the
family
followed
her
just
in
time
to
take
the
train
as
it
was
leaving
the
station
the
excitement
was
not
yet
over
they
found
in
the
train
many
of
their
friends
and
neighbors
returning
also
from
the
carnival
so
they
had
many
questions
put
to
them
which
they
were
unable
to
answer
still
peterkin
s
turban
was
much
admired
and
indeed
the
whole
appearance
of
the
family
so
that
they
felt
themselves
much
repaid
for
their
exertions
but
more
adventures
awaited
them
they
left
the
train
with
their
friends
but
as
peterkin
and
elizabeth
eliza
were
very
tired
they
walked
very
slowly
and
solomon
john
and
the
little
boys
were
sent
on
with
the
to
open
the
door
they
soon
returned
with
the
startling
intelligence
that
it
was
not
the
right
key
and
they
could
not
get
in
it
was
peterkin
s
he
had
taken
it
by
mistake
or
he
might
have
dropped
the
in
the
of
the
carnival
must
we
go
back
sighed
peterkin
in
an
exhausted
voice
more
than
ever
did
elizabeth
eliza
regret
that
agamemnon
s
invention
in
keys
had
failed
to
secure
a
patent
it
was
impossible
to
get
into
the
house
for
amanda
had
been
allowed
to
go
and
spend
the
night
with
a
friend
so
there
was
no
use
in
ringing
though
the
little
boys
had
tried
it
we
can
return
to
the
station
said
peterkin
the
rooms
will
be
warm
on
account
of
the
midnight
train
we
can
at
least
think
what
we
shall
do
at
the
station
was
one
of
their
neighbors
proposing
to
take
the
new
york
midnight
train
for
it
was
now
after
eleven
and
the
train
went
through
at
i
saw
lights
at
the
locksmith
s
over
the
way
as
i
passed
he
said
why
do
not
you
send
over
to
the
young
man
there
he
can
get
your
door
open
for
you
i
never
would
spend
the
night
solomon
john
went
over
to
the
young
man
who
agreed
to
go
up
to
the
house
as
soon
as
he
had
closed
the
shop
fit
a
key
and
open
the
door
and
come
back
to
them
on
his
way
home
solomon
john
came
back
to
the
station
for
it
was
now
cold
and
windy
in
the
deserted
streets
the
family
made
themselves
as
comfortable
as
possible
by
the
stove
sending
solomon
john
out
occasionally
to
look
for
the
young
man
but
somehow
solomon
john
missed
him
the
lights
were
out
in
the
locksmith
s
shop
so
he
followed
along
to
the
house
hoping
to
find
him
there
but
he
was
not
there
he
came
back
to
report
perhaps
the
young
man
had
opened
the
door
and
gone
on
home
solomon
john
and
agamemnon
went
back
together
but
they
could
not
get
in
where
was
the
young
man
he
had
lately
come
to
town
and
nobody
knew
where
he
lived
for
on
the
return
of
solomon
john
and
agamemnon
it
had
been
proposed
to
go
to
the
house
of
the
young
man
the
night
was
wearing
on
the
midnight
train
had
come
and
gone
the
passengers
who
came
and
went
looked
with
wonder
at
peterkin
nodding
in
her
turban
as
she
sat
by
the
stove
on
a
corner
of
a
long
bench
at
last
the
had
to
leave
for
a
short
rest
he
felt
obliged
to
lock
up
the
station
but
he
promised
to
return
at
an
early
hour
to
release
them
of
what
use
said
elizabeth
eliza
if
we
can
not
even
then
get
into
our
own
house
peterkin
thought
the
matter
appeared
bad
if
the
locksmith
had
left
town
he
feared
the
young
man
might
have
gone
in
and
helped
himself
to
spoons
and
left
only
they
should
have
seen
him
if
he
had
taken
the
midnight
train
solomon
john
thought
he
appeared
honest
peterkin
only
ventured
to
whisper
his
suspicions
as
he
did
not
wish
to
arouse
peterkin
who
still
was
nodding
in
the
corner
of
the
long
bench
morning
did
come
at
last
the
family
decided
to
go
to
their
home
perhaps
by
some
effort
in
the
early
daylight
they
might
make
an
entrance
on
the
way
they
met
with
the
returning
from
his
beat
he
stopped
when
he
saw
the
family
ah
that
accounts
he
said
you
were
all
out
last
night
and
the
burglars
took
occasion
to
make
a
raid
on
your
house
i
caught
a
lively
young
man
in
the
very
act
box
of
tools
in
his
hand
if
i
had
been
a
minute
late
he
would
have
made
his
way
in
the
family
then
tried
to
interrupt
to
explain
where
is
he
exclaimed
peterkin
safe
in
the
answered
the
policeman
but
he
is
the
locksmith
interrupted
solomon
john
we
have
no
key
said
elizabeth
eliza
if
you
have
locked
up
the
locksmith
we
can
never
get
the
policeman
looked
from
one
to
the
other
smiling
slightly
when
he
understood
the
case
the
locksmith
he
exclaimed
he
is
a
new
fellow
and
i
did
not
recognize
him
and
arrested
him
very
well
i
will
go
and
let
him
out
that
he
may
let
you
in
and
he
hurried
away
surprising
the
peterkin
family
with
what
seemed
like
insulting
screams
of
laughter
it
seems
to
me
a
more
serious
case
than
it
appears
to
him
said
peterkin
peterkin
did
not
understand
it
at
all
had
burglars
entered
the
house
did
the
policeman
say
they
had
taken
spoons
and
why
did
he
appear
so
pleased
she
was
sure
the
old
silver
teapot
was
locked
up
in
the
closet
of
their
room
slowly
the
family
walked
towards
the
house
and
almost
as
soon
as
they
the
policeman
appeared
with
the
released
locksmith
and
a
few
boys
from
the
street
who
happened
to
be
out
early
the
locksmith
was
not
in
very
good
humor
and
took
ill
the
jokes
of
the
policeman
peterkin
fearing
he
might
not
consent
to
open
the
door
pressed
into
his
hand
a
large
sum
of
money
the
door
flew
open
the
family
could
go
in
amanda
arrived
at
the
same
moment
there
was
hope
of
breakfast
peterkin
staggered
towards
the
stairs
i
shall
never
go
to
another
carnival
she
exclaimed
the
peterkins
at
the
farm
yes
at
last
they
had
reached
the
seaside
after
much
talking
and
deliberation
and
summer
after
summer
the
journey
had
been
constantly
postponed
but
here
they
were
at
last
at
the
old
farm
so
called
where
seaside
attractions
had
been
praised
in
all
the
advertisements
and
here
they
were
to
meet
the
sylvesters
who
knew
all
about
the
place
cousins
of
ann
maria
bromwick
elizabeth
eliza
was
astonished
not
to
find
them
there
though
she
had
not
expected
ann
maria
to
join
them
till
the
very
next
day
their
preparations
had
been
so
elaborate
that
at
one
time
the
whole
thing
had
seemed
hopeless
yet
here
they
all
were
their
trunks
to
be
sure
had
not
arrived
but
the
wagon
was
to
be
sent
back
for
them
and
wonderful
to
tell
they
had
all
their
safe
agamemnon
had
brought
his
portable
electrical
machine
and
apparatus
and
the
volumes
of
the
encyclopædia
that
might
tell
him
how
to
manage
it
and
solomon
john
had
his
photograph
camera
the
little
boys
had
used
their
boots
as
portmanteaux
filling
them
to
the
brim
and
carrying
one
in
each
hand
a
very
convenient
way
for
travelling
they
considered
it
but
they
found
on
arriving
when
they
wanted
to
put
their
boots
directly
on
for
exploration
round
the
house
that
it
was
somewhat
inconvenient
to
have
to
begin
to
unpack
directly
and
scarcely
room
enough
could
be
found
for
all
the
contents
in
the
small
chamber
allotted
to
them
there
was
no
room
in
the
house
for
the
electrical
machine
and
camera
elizabeth
eliza
thought
the
other
boarders
were
afraid
of
the
machine
going
off
so
an
was
found
for
them
where
agamemnon
and
solomon
john
could
arrange
them
peterkin
was
much
pleased
with
the
porch
and
rooms
though
the
seemed
a
little
stuffy
at
first
peterkin
was
delighted
with
the
admirable
order
in
which
the
farm
was
evidently
kept
from
the
first
moment
he
arrived
he
gave
himself
to
examining
the
stables
and
barns
and
the
fields
and
vegetable
gardens
which
were
shown
to
him
by
a
highly
intelligent
person
a
atwood
who
devoted
himself
to
explaining
to
peterkin
all
the
details
of
methods
in
the
farming
the
rest
of
the
family
were
disturbed
at
being
so
far
from
the
sea
when
they
found
it
would
take
nearly
all
the
afternoon
to
reach
the
beach
the
advertisements
had
surely
stated
that
the
old
farm
was
directly
on
the
shore
and
that
would
be
exceedingly
convenient
which
was
hardly
the
case
if
it
took
you
an
hour
and
a
half
to
walk
to
it
peterkin
declared
there
were
always
such
discrepancies
between
the
advertisements
of
seaside
places
and
the
actual
facts
but
he
was
more
than
satisfied
with
the
farm
part
and
was
glad
to
remain
and
admire
it
while
the
rest
of
the
family
went
to
find
the
beach
starting
off
in
a
wagon
large
enough
to
accommodate
them
agamemnon
driving
the
one
horse
solomon
john
had
depended
upon
taking
the
photographs
of
the
family
in
a
row
on
the
beach
but
he
decided
not
to
take
his
camera
out
the
first
afternoon
this
was
well
as
the
sun
was
already
setting
when
they
reached
the
beach
if
this
wagon
were
not
so
shaky
said
peterkin
we
might
drive
over
every
morning
for
our
bath
the
road
is
very
straight
and
i
suppose
agamemnon
can
turn
on
the
we
should
have
to
spend
the
whole
day
about
it
said
solomon
john
in
a
discouraged
tone
unless
we
can
have
a
quicker
perhaps
we
should
prefer
that
said
elizabeth
eliza
a
little
gloomily
to
staying
at
the
she
had
been
a
little
disturbed
to
find
there
were
not
more
elegant
and
boarders
at
the
farm
and
she
was
disappointed
that
the
sylvesters
had
not
arrived
who
would
understand
the
ways
of
the
place
yet
again
she
was
somewhat
relieved
for
if
their
trunks
did
not
come
till
the
next
day
as
was
feared
she
should
have
nothing
but
her
travelling
dress
to
wear
which
would
certainly
answer
for
she
had
been
busy
all
the
early
summer
in
preparing
her
dresses
for
this
very
and
as
far
as
appeared
she
would
hardly
need
them
and
was
disappointed
to
have
no
chance
to
display
them
but
of
course
when
the
sylvesters
and
ann
maria
came
all
would
be
different
but
they
would
surely
be
wasted
on
the
two
old
ladies
she
had
seen
and
on
the
old
men
who
had
lounged
about
the
porch
there
surely
was
not
a
gentleman
among
them
agamemnon
assured
her
she
could
not
tell
at
the
seaside
as
gentlemen
wore
their
exercise
dress
and
took
a
pride
in
going
around
in
shocking
hats
and
flannel
suits
doubtless
they
would
be
dressed
for
dinner
on
their
return
on
their
arrival
they
had
been
shown
to
a
room
to
have
their
meals
by
themselves
and
could
not
decide
whether
they
were
eating
dinner
or
lunch
there
was
a
variety
of
meat
vegetables
and
pie
that
might
come
under
either
name
but
and
peterkin
were
well
pleased
i
had
no
idea
we
should
have
really
peterkin
said
i
have
not
drunk
such
a
tumbler
of
milk
since
i
was
elizabeth
eliza
concluded
they
ought
not
to
judge
from
a
first
meal
as
evidently
their
arrival
had
not
been
fully
prepared
for
in
spite
of
the
numerous
letters
that
had
been
exchanged
the
little
boys
were
however
perfectly
satisfied
from
the
moment
of
their
arrival
and
one
of
them
had
stayed
at
the
farm
declining
to
go
to
the
beach
as
he
wished
to
admire
the
pigs
cows
and
horses
and
all
the
way
over
to
the
beach
the
other
little
boys
were
hopping
in
and
out
of
the
wagon
which
never
went
too
fast
to
pick
long
for
whips
to
urge
on
the
reluctant
horse
with
or
to
gather
huckleberries
with
which
they
were
rejoiced
to
find
the
fields
were
filled
although
as
yet
the
berries
were
very
green
they
wanted
to
stay
longer
on
the
beach
when
they
finally
reached
it
but
peterkin
and
elizabeth
eliza
insisted
upon
turning
directly
back
as
it
was
not
fair
to
be
late
to
dinner
the
very
first
night
on
the
whole
the
party
came
back
cheerful
yet
hungry
they
found
the
same
old
men
in
the
same
costume
standing
against
the
porch
a
little
seedy
i
should
say
said
solomon
john
smoking
pipes
said
agamemnon
i
believe
that
is
the
latest
the
smell
of
their
tobacco
is
not
very
agreeable
peterkin
was
forced
to
say
there
seemed
the
same
uncertainty
on
their
arrival
as
to
where
they
were
to
be
put
and
as
to
their
meals
elizabeth
eliza
tried
to
get
into
conversation
with
the
old
ladies
who
were
wandering
in
and
out
of
a
small
but
one
of
them
was
very
deaf
and
the
other
seemed
to
be
a
foreigner
she
discovered
from
a
moderately
tidy
maid
by
the
name
of
martha
who
seemed
a
sort
of
factotum
that
there
were
other
ladies
in
their
rooms
too
much
of
invalids
to
appear
regular
martha
had
described
them
which
elizabeth
eliza
did
not
consider
respectful
peterkin
appeared
coming
down
the
slope
of
the
hill
behind
the
house
very
cheerful
he
had
made
the
tour
of
the
farm
and
found
it
in
admirable
order
elizabeth
eliza
felt
it
time
to
ask
martha
about
the
next
meal
and
ventured
to
call
it
supper
as
a
sort
of
compromise
between
dinner
and
tea
if
dinner
were
expected
she
might
offend
by
taking
it
for
granted
that
it
was
to
be
tea
and
if
they
were
unused
to
a
late
dinner
they
might
be
disturbed
if
they
had
only
provided
a
so
she
asked
what
was
the
usual
hour
for
supper
and
was
surprised
when
martha
replied
the
lady
must
say
nodding
to
peterkin
she
can
have
it
just
when
she
wants
and
just
what
she
wants
this
was
an
unexpected
courtesy
elizabeth
eliza
asked
when
the
others
had
their
supper
oh
they
took
it
a
long
time
ago
martha
answered
if
the
lady
will
go
out
into
the
kitchen
she
can
tell
what
she
bring
us
in
what
you
have
said
peterkin
himself
quite
hungry
if
you
could
cook
us
a
fresh
slice
of
beefsteak
that
would
be
perhaps
some
eggs
murmured
peterkin
scrambled
cried
one
of
the
little
boys
fried
potatoes
would
not
be
bad
suggested
agamemnon
couldn
t
we
have
some
onions
asked
the
little
boy
who
had
stayed
at
home
and
had
noticed
the
odor
of
onions
when
the
others
had
their
supper
a
pie
would
come
in
well
said
solomon
john
and
some
stewed
cherries
said
the
other
little
boy
martha
fell
to
laying
the
table
and
the
family
was
much
pleased
when
in
the
course
of
time
all
the
dishes
they
had
recommended
appeared
their
appetites
were
admirable
and
they
pronounced
the
food
the
same
this
is
true
arab
hospitality
said
peterkin
as
he
cut
his
juicy
beefsteak
i
know
it
said
elizabeth
eliza
whose
spirits
began
to
rise
we
have
not
even
seen
the
host
and
she
would
indeed
have
been
glad
to
find
some
one
to
tell
her
when
the
sylvesters
were
expected
and
why
they
had
not
arrived
her
room
was
in
the
wing
far
from
that
of
and
peterkin
and
near
the
aged
deaf
and
foreign
ladies
and
she
was
kept
awake
for
some
time
by
perplexed
thoughts
she
was
sure
the
lady
from
philadelphia
under
such
circumstances
would
have
written
to
somebody
but
ought
she
to
write
to
ann
maria
or
the
sylvesters
and
if
she
did
write
which
had
she
better
write
to
she
fully
determined
to
write
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
to
both
parties
but
how
should
she
address
her
letters
would
there
be
any
use
in
sending
to
the
sylvesters
usual
address
which
she
knew
well
by
this
time
merely
to
say
they
had
not
come
of
course
the
sylvesters
would
know
they
had
not
come
it
would
be
the
same
with
ann
maria
she
might
indeed
inclose
her
letters
to
their
several
postmasters
postmasters
were
always
so
obliging
and
always
knew
where
people
were
going
to
and
where
to
send
their
letters
she
might
at
least
write
two
letters
to
say
that
they
the
peterkins
had
arrived
and
were
disappointed
not
to
find
the
sylvesters
and
she
could
add
that
their
trunks
had
not
arrived
and
perhaps
their
friends
might
look
out
for
them
on
their
way
it
really
seemed
a
good
plan
to
write
yet
another
question
came
up
as
to
how
she
would
get
her
letters
to
the
as
she
had
already
learned
it
was
at
quite
a
distance
and
in
a
different
direction
from
the
station
where
they
were
to
send
the
next
day
for
their
trunks
she
went
over
and
over
these
same
questions
kept
awake
by
the
coughing
and
talking
of
her
neighbors
the
other
side
of
the
thin
partition
she
was
scarcely
sorry
to
be
aroused
from
her
uncomfortable
sleep
by
the
morning
sounds
of
peacocks
and
every
other
kind
of
fowl
peterkin
expressed
her
satisfaction
at
the
early
breakfast
and
declared
she
was
delighted
with
such
genuine
farm
sounds
they
passed
the
day
much
as
the
afternoon
before
reaching
the
beach
only
in
time
to
turn
round
to
come
back
for
their
dinner
which
was
appointed
at
noon
peterkin
was
quite
satisfied
such
a
straight
road
and
the
beach
such
a
safe
place
to
turn
round
upon
elizabeth
eliza
was
not
so
well
pleased
a
wagon
had
been
sent
to
the
station
for
their
trunks
which
could
not
be
found
they
were
probably
left
at
the
boston
station
or
atwood
suggested
might
have
been
switched
off
upon
one
of
the
white
mountain
trains
there
was
no
use
to
write
any
letters
as
there
was
no
way
to
send
them
elizabeth
eliza
now
almost
hoped
the
sylvesters
would
not
come
for
what
should
she
do
if
the
trunks
did
not
come
and
all
her
new
dresses
on
her
way
over
to
the
beach
she
had
been
thinking
what
she
should
do
with
her
new
foulard
and
surah
if
the
sylvesters
did
not
come
and
if
their
time
was
spent
in
only
driving
to
the
beach
and
back
but
now
she
would
prefer
that
the
sylvesters
would
not
come
till
the
dresses
and
the
trunks
did
all
she
could
find
out
from
inquiry
on
returning
was
that
another
lot
was
expected
on
the
next
day
she
suggested
suppose
we
take
our
dinner
with
us
to
the
beach
and
spend
the
the
sylvesters
and
ann
maria
then
would
find
them
on
the
beach
where
her
would
be
quite
appropriate
i
am
a
little
tired
she
added
of
going
back
and
forward
over
the
same
road
but
when
the
rest
come
we
can
vary
the
plan
was
agreed
to
but
peterkin
and
the
little
boys
remained
to
go
over
the
farm
again
they
had
an
excellent
picnic
on
the
beach
under
the
shadow
of
a
ledge
of
sand
they
were
just
putting
up
their
things
when
they
saw
a
party
of
people
approaching
from
the
other
end
of
the
beach
i
am
glad
to
see
some
people
at
last
said
elizabeth
eliza
and
they
all
turned
to
walk
toward
them
as
the
other
party
drew
near
she
recognized
ann
maria
bromwick
and
with
her
were
the
sylvesters
so
they
proved
to
be
for
she
had
never
seen
them
before
what
you
have
come
in
our
absence
exclaimed
elizabeth
eliza
and
we
have
been
wondering
what
had
become
of
you
cried
ann
maria
i
thought
you
would
be
at
the
farm
before
us
said
elizabeth
eliza
to
sylvester
to
whom
she
was
introduced
we
have
been
looking
for
you
at
the
farm
he
was
saying
to
her
but
we
are
at
the
farm
said
elizabeth
eliza
and
so
are
we
said
ann
maria
we
have
been
there
two
days
said
peterkin
and
so
have
we
at
the
old
farm
just
at
the
end
of
the
beach
said
ann
maria
our
farm
is
old
enough
said
solomon
john
whereabouts
are
you
asked
sylvester
elizabeth
eliza
pointed
to
the
road
they
had
come
a
smile
came
over
sylvester
s
face
he
knew
the
country
well
you
mean
the
behind
the
hill
at
the
end
of
the
road
he
asked
the
peterkins
all
nodded
affirmatively
ann
maria
could
not
restrain
herself
as
broad
smiles
came
over
the
faces
of
all
the
party
why
that
is
the
she
exclaimed
the
town
farm
sylvester
explained
deprecatingly
the
peterkins
were
silent
for
a
while
the
sylvesters
tried
not
to
laugh
there
certainly
were
some
disagreeable
old
men
and
women
there
said
elizabeth
eliza
at
last
but
we
have
surely
been
made
very
comfortable
peterkin
declared
a
very
simple
mistake
said
sylvester
continuing
his
amusement
your
trunks
arrived
all
right
at
the
old
farm
two
days
let
us
go
back
directly
said
elizabeth
eliza
as
directly
as
our
horse
will
allow
said
agamemnon
sylvester
helped
them
into
the
wagon
your
rooms
are
awaiting
you
he
said
why
not
come
with
us
we
want
to
find
peterkin
before
we
do
anything
else
said
peterkin
they
rode
back
in
silence
till
elizabeth
eliza
said
do
you
suppose
they
took
us
for
paupers
we
have
not
seen
any
they
said
solomon
john
except
at
the
entrance
of
the
peterkin
met
them
i
have
been
looking
for
you
he
said
i
have
just
made
a
we
have
made
it
too
said
elizabeth
eliza
we
are
in
the
how
did
you
find
it
out
peterkin
asked
of
peterkin
mr
atwood
came
to
me
puzzled
with
a
telegram
that
had
been
brought
to
him
from
the
station
which
he
ought
to
have
got
two
days
ago
it
came
from
a
peters
whom
they
were
expecting
here
this
week
with
his
wife
and
boys
to
take
charge
of
the
establishment
he
telegraphed
to
say
he
can
not
come
till
friday
now
atwood
had
supposed
we
were
the
peterses
whom
he
had
sent
for
the
day
we
arrived
not
having
received
this
oh
i
see
i
see
said
peterkin
and
we
did
get
into
a
muddle
at
the
station
atwood
met
them
at
the
porch
i
beg
pardon
he
said
i
hope
you
have
found
it
comfortable
here
and
shall
be
glad
to
have
you
stay
till
peters
family
at
this
moment
wheels
were
heard
sylvester
had
arrived
with
an
open
wagon
to
take
the
peterkins
to
the
old
martha
was
waiting
within
the
door
and
said
to
elizabeth
eliza
beg
pardon
miss
for
thinking
you
was
one
of
the
inmates
and
putting
you
in
that
room
we
thought
it
so
kind
of
peters
to
take
you
off
every
day
with
the
other
gentlemen
that
looked
so
elizabeth
eliza
did
not
know
whether
to
laugh
or
to
cry
peterkin
and
the
little
boys
decided
to
stay
at
the
farm
till
friday
but
agamemnon
and
solomon
john
preferred
to
leave
with
sylvester
and
to
take
their
electrical
machine
and
camera
when
they
came
for
peterkin
peterkin
was
tempted
to
stay
another
night
to
be
wakened
once
more
by
the
but
elizabeth
eliza
bore
her
off
there
was
not
much
packing
to
be
done
she
shouted
into
the
ears
of
the
deaf
old
lady
and
waved
her
hand
to
the
foreign
one
and
glad
to
bid
farewell
to
the
old
men
with
their
pipes
leaning
against
the
porch
this
time
she
said
it
is
not
our
trunks
that
were
lost
but
we
as
a
family
said
peterkin
