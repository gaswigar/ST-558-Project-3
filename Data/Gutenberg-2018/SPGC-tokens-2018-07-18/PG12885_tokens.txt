whose
jealous
love
of
his

led
him
in
defense
of
her
good
fame
to
make
some
strictures
upon
a
statement
relative
to
in
my
and
genealogies
of
ancient
windsor
which
strictures
made
and
taken
in
the
kindest
spirit
of
personal
friendship
set
me
upon
the
further
investigation
of
this
interesting
subject
this
essay
the
result
of
that
investigation
and
the
justification
as
i
claim
of
my
original
statement
is
most
respectfully
dedicated
by
the
author
prefatory
in
the
and
genealogies
of
ancient
windsor
published
in
speaking
of
the
influence
of
the
old
french
wars
upon
the
religious
moral
and
social
life
of
new
england
i
used
this
language
then
came
war
and
young
new
england
brought
from
the
long
canadian
campaigns
stores
of
loose
camp
vices
and
recklessness
which
soon
flooded
the
land
with
immorality
and
infidelity
the
church
was
neglected
drunkenness
fearfully
increased
and
social
life
was
sadly
corrupted
that
ridiculous
and
pernicious
custom
which
prevailed
among
the
young
to
a
degree
which
we
can
scarcely
credit
sapped
the
fountain
of
morality
and
tarnished
the
escutcheons
of
thousands
of
families
hereupon
there
came
a
buzzing
around
my
ears
divers
good
sons
of
connecticut
winced
under
the
soft
impeachment
of
having
a
bundling
ancestry
and
intimated
that
my
sketch
of
society
in
the
olden
times
was
somewhat
overdrawn
in
an
esteemed
antiquarian
friend
in
connecticut
wrote
me
as
follows
some
of
your
friends
feel
that
in
your
of
you
showed
too
much
inclination
to
malign
or
at
least
ridicule
connecticut
institutions
though
i
think
none
of
them
accuse
you
of
malice
in
the
matter
and
they
fear
that
this
subject
of
bundling
can
not
be
ventilated
without
endangering
the
fair
fame
of
old
connecticut
upon
that
hint
i
speak
although
born
in
the
city
of
new
york
i
am
the
son
of
connecticut
parents
and
proud
to
trace
my
descent
through
six
generations
of
honest
connecticut
yeomanry
by
the
mere
accident
of
birth
i
can
not
feel
myself
absolved
from
that
allegiance
to
the
wooden
nutmeg
state
which
is
imposed
upon
me
by
the
ties
of
ancestry
of
relationship
of
youthful
associations
and
last
not
least
by
the
deep
interest
which
i
have
taken
in
the
history
of
one
of
its
towns
i
am
indeed
at
this
day
to
all
intents
and
purposes
as
wholly
and
truly
a
connecticut
man
as
if
born
within
her
borders
and
as
proud
of
her
past
as
hopeful
of
her
future
and
as
jealous
of
her
reputation
as
any
one
could
desire
i
trust
therefore
that
i
may
be
allowed
to
disclaim
any
inclination
to
malign
or
at
least
ridicule
connecticut
institutions
a
task
which
in
my
case
would
savor
of
ingratitude
and
which
i
should
consider
unworthy
of
my
humble
pen
i
can
not
but
think
also
that
those
who
have
found
or
think
that
they
have
found
an
inimical
design
in
any
pleasantries
in
which
i
may
have
indulged
while
describing
the
customs
and
manners
of
days
have
betrayed
a
and
an
ignorance
of
the
true
glory
of
connecticut
history
when
they
imagine
that
her
fair
fame
can
be
seriously
tarnished
by
the
of
certain
customs
at
no
time
without
their
vigorous
opponents
and
long
since
rendered
obsolete
by
the
march
of
improvement
the
fun
of
the
thing
however
is
that
the
sentence
which
has
thus
called
forth
the
animadversions
of
the
critics
will
be
found
with
its
context
on
closer
examination
to
have
applied
to
the
england
and
not
to
connecticut
alone
in
their
haste
to
vindicate
the
land
of
steady
habits
they
seem
to
have
assumed
more
than
their
share
of
the
reproach
involved
in
my
simple
historical
statement
as
for
myself
i
am
no
believer
in
the
theory
that
the
objectionable
portions
of
history
should
be
kept
in
the
background
and
that
only
the
bright
side
should
be
turned
towards
the
world
if
as
one
has
happily
said
history
is
experience
teaching
by
example
we
most
surely
need
to
have
both
sides
fairly
presented
to
us
before
we
can
properly
extract
therefrom
the
lesson
of
good
or
of
evil
which
is
therein
taught
it
is
unnecessary
to
pursue
the
argument
further
suffice
it
to
say
that
perfection
is
as
little
to
be
expected
in
the
history
of
a
state
or
a
community
as
in
the
life
of
an
individual
as
to
our
ancestors
we
must
take
them
as
history
shows
them
to
us
men
of
like
passions
with
ourselves
and
in
all
respects
tempted
as
we
are
yet
neither
worse
nor
again
very
much
purer
or
better
than
ourselves
in
this
spirit
i
have
undertaken
to
trace
in
the
following
pages
the
origin
progress
and
decline
of
the
custom
of
bundling
in
america
together
with
such
facts
as
clearly
prove
that
it
was
not
confined
to
this
continent
but
prevalent
in
various
countries
of
the
world

bundling
bundling
a
man
and
a
woman
lying
on
the
same
bed
with
their
clothes
on
an
expedient
practiced
in
america
on
a
scarcity
of
beds
where
on
such
occasions
husbands
and
parents
frequently
permitted
travellers
to
with
their
wives
and
daughters
dictionary
of
the
vulgar
bundle
to
sleep
on
the
same
bed
without
undressing
applied
to
the
custom
of
a
man
and
woman
especially
lovers
thus
sleeping
bundle
to
sleep
together
with
the
clothes
on
bundling
as
may
be
seen
from
the
above
quoted
definitions
was
practiced
in
two
forms
first
between
as
a
simple
domestic
arrangement
often
arising
from
the
necessities
of
a
new
country
and
by
no
means
peculiar
to
america
and
secondly
between
who
shared
the
same
couch
with
the
mutual
understanding
that
innocent
endearments
should
not
be
exceeded
it
was
however
in
either
case
a
custom
of
convenience
we
may
notice
in
this
connection
that
it
is
very
common
even
at
the
present
day
in
new
england
to
speak
of
one
as
having
bundled
in
with
his
clothes
on
if
he
goes
to
bed
without
undressing
as
for
instance
if
he
came
home
drunk
or
feeling
slightly
ill
lay
down
in
the
daytime
or
in
a
cold
night
found
the
blankets
too
scanty
the
point
which
first
claims
our
attention
in
the
discussion
of
this
custom
is
its
probable
and
its
in
the
british
isles
for
though
british
travelers
have
uniformly
endeavored
to
fix
the
odium
of
this
custom
upon
us
their
transatlantic
cousins
as
being
peculiarly
an
american
institution
it
is
nevertheless
an
indisputable
fact
that
bundling
has
for
centuries
flourished
within
their
own
kingdom
for
what
else
in
fact
was
that
universal
custom
of
promiscuous
sleeping
together
which
prevailed
among
the
ancient
britons
at
the
time
of
the
roman
conquest
and
which
led
cæsar
to
consider
them
as
polyandrous
polygamists
and
other
ancient
writers
to
give
them
an
unenviable
character
for
morality
bundling
of
course
in
its
rudest
aboriginal
form
as
to
its
moral
aspects
being
more
charitably
inclined
towards
our
british
friends
than
they
oftentimes
are
to
us
we
are
willing
to
accept
logan
defense
of
their
ancestors
the
custom
he
says
which
continued
until
lately
in
some
parts
and
yet
exists
among
a
few
of
the
rudest
who
sleep
altogether
on
straw
or
rushes
according
to
the
general
ancient
practice
there
is
reason
to
believe
led
to
the
aspersion
cast
on
the
british
and
irish
tribes
how
natural
it
must
have
been
for
a
casual
observer
to
suppose
from
seeing
men
and
women
reposing
in
the
same
place
that
the
marriage
rites
were
not
in
force
to
judge
of
the
ancient
inhabitants
by
the
rudest
of
the
present
highlanders
and
irish
who
often
sleep
in
the
same
apartment
and
are
sometimes
exposed
to
each
other
in
a
state
of
we
should
not
come
to
a
conclusion
unfavorable
to
their
morality
for
this
mode
of
life
is
not
productive
of
that
conjugal
infidelity
which
jerome
and
others
insinuate
as
prevalent
among
the
old
scots
nations
that
are
even
in
a
savage
state
are
sometimes
found
more
sensitive
on
that
point
of
honor
than
nations
more
advanced
in
civilization
and
all
perhaps
that
can
be
admitted
is
that
certain
formalities
may
have
been
practiced
by
the
britons
from
which
the
of
the
welsh
and
the
in
some
parts
of
scotland
are
derived
the
conversation
which
took
place
between
the
empress
julia
and
the
wife
of
a
caledonian
chief
as
related
by
xiphilin
certainly
evinces
a
grossness
and
indelicacy
in
the
amours
of
the
british
ladies
if
true
but
it
appears
to
be
a
reply
where
wit
and
reproof
were
more
aimed
at
than
truth
the
case
of
the
empress
cartismandua
shows
the
nice
feeling
of
the
britons
as
to
the
propriety
of
female
conduct
the
respect
of
the
germans
for
their
females
and
the
severity
with
which
they
visited
a
deviation
from
virtue
have
been
described
and
the
further
testimony
of
tacitus
may
be
adduced
who
says
that
but
very
few
of
the
greatest
dignity
chose
to
have
more
than
one
wife
and
when
they
did
it
was
merely
for
the
honor
of
alliance
it
may
be
here
stated
that
the
gaëls
have
no
word
to
express
cuckold
and
that
prostitutes
were
by
law
like
that
of
the
ancient
germans
thrown
into
deep
wells
and
a
woman
was
not
permitted
to
complain
of
an
assault
if
she
allowed
more
than
one
night
to
elapse
before
the
accusation
scottish
am
edition
p
indeed
whatever
may
have
been
the
real
state
of
morality
among
the
ancient
scotch
and
irish
and
it
is
quite
probable
that
it
has
been
unfairly
depicted
by
casual
and
prejudiced
observers
the
ancient
custom
of
bundling
which
has
been
handed
down
from
earliest
times
has
not
greatly
contaminated
their
descendants
of
the
present
day
for
whatever
their
national
vices
the
scotch
and
irish
of
our
day
maintain
a
character
for
chastity
superior
to
that
of
many
of
their
more
fortunate
and
more
civilized
neighbors
bundling
as
now
practiced
in
these
kingdoms
is
merely
a
matter
arising
from
the
ignorance
or
the
poverty
of
the
inhabitants
and
while
not
salutary
in
its
moral
or
physical
influence
is
at
all
events
less
abused
than
we
might
reasonably
expect
in
regard
to
wales
we
learn
from
woodward
admirable
history
of
that
kingdom
the
following
facts
concerning
the
domestic
habits
of
its
people
in
the
twelfth
century
at
night
a
bed
of
rushes
was
laid
down
along
one
side
of
the
room
covered
with
a
coarse
kind
of
cloth
made
in
the
country
called
and
all
the
household
lay
down
on
this
bed
in
common
without
changing
their
dresses
the
fire
was
kept
burning
through
the
night
and
the
sleepers
maintained
their
warmth
by
lying
closely
and
when
by
the
hardness
of
their
couch
one
side
was
wearied
they
would
get
up
and
sit
by
the
fire
awhile
and
then
lie
down
again
on
the
other
side
it
is
to
this
custom
of
promiscuous
sleeping
that
some
of
the
worst
habits
of
the
welsh
at
the
present
day
may
be
ascribed
and
from
the
same
custom
which
their
forefathers
the
ancient
britons
practiced
arose
supposition
that
they
were
polyandrous
polygamists
these
habits
which
were
a
matter
of
necessity
with
the
ancient
welsh
have
become
converted
by
the
lapse
of
time
among
their
descendants
of
the
present
day
into
an
amatory
custom
precisely
similar
to
that
practiced
formerly
in
new
england
a
tourist
through
wales
in
the
year
thus
speaks
of
the
welsh
and
here
amongst
the
usages
and
customs
i
must
not
omit
to
inform
you
that
what
you
have
perhaps
often
heard
without
believing
respecting
the
of
amongst
the
welsh
peasants
is
true
the
lower
order
of
people
do
actually
carry
on
their
love
affairs
in
bed
and
what
would
extremely
astonish
more
polished
lovers
they
are
carried
on
honorably
it
being
at
least
as
usual
for
the
pastoras
of
the
mountains
to
go
from
the
bed
of
courtship
to
the
bed
of
marriage
as
unpolluted
and
maidenly
as
the
chloes
of
fashion
and
yet
you
are
not
to
conclude
that
this
proceeds
from
their
being
less
susceptible
of
the
than
their
betters
or
that
the
cold
air
which
they
breathe
has
the
genial
current
of
their
souls
by
no
means
if
they
can
not
boast
the
voluptuous
languor
of
an
italian
sky
they
glow
with
the
bracing
spirit
of
a
more
invigorating
atmosphere
i
really
took
some
pains
to
investigate
this
curious
custom
and
after
being
assured
by
many
of
its
veracity
had
an
opportunity
of
attesting
its
existence
with
my
own
eyes
the
servant
maid
of
the
family
i
visited
in
caernarvonshire
happened
to
be
the
object
of
a
young
peasant
who
walked
eleven
long
miles
every
sunday
morning
to
favor
his
suit
and
regularly
returned
the
same
night
through
all
weathers
to
be
ready
for
monday
employment
in
the
fields
being
simply
a
day
laborer
he
usually
arrived
in
time
for
morning
service
which
he
constantly
attended
after
which
he
escorted
his
dulcinea
home
to
the
house
of
her
master
by
whose
permission
they
as
constantly
passed
the
succeeding
hour
in
bed
according
to
the
custom
of
the
country
these
tender
sabbatical
preliminaries
continued
without
interruption
near
two
years
when
the
treaty
of
alliance
was
solemnized
and
so
far
from
any
breach
of
articles
happening
in
the
meantime
it
is
most
likely
that
it
was
considered
by
both
parties
as
a
matter
of
course
without
exciting
any
other
idea
on
speaking
to
my
friend
on
the
subject
he
observed
that
though
it
certainly
appeared
a
dangerous
mode
of
making
love
he
had
seen
so
few
abuses
of
it
during
six
and
thirty
residence
in
that
country
where
it
nevertheless
had
always
more
or
less
prevailed
he
must
conclude
it
was
as
innocent
as
any
other
one
proof
of
its
being
so
by
the
parties
is
the
perfect
ease
and
freedom
with
which
it
is
done
no
awkwardness
or
confusion
appearing
on
either
side
the
most
and
decent
young
woman
going
into
it
without
a
blush
and
they
are
by
no
means
deficient
in
modesty
what
is
pure
in
idea
is
always
so
in
conduct
since
bad
actions
are
the
common
consequence
of
bad
thoughts
and
though
the
better
sort
of
people
treat
this
ceremony
as
a
barbarism
it
is
very
much
to
be
doubted
whether
more
have
been
committed
by
the
cambrian
boors
in
this
to
the
bed
chambers
of
their
mistresses
than
by
more
fashionable
strephons
and
their
nymphs
in
groves
and
shady
bowers
the
power
of
habit
is
perhaps
stronger
than
the
power
of
passion
or
even
of
the
charms
which
inspire
it
and
it
is
sufficient
almost
to
say
a
thing
is
the
of
a
to
clear
it
from
any
reproach
that
would
attach
to
an
innovation
were
it
the
practice
of
a
few
only
and
to
be
gratified
by
stealth
there
would
from
the
strange
construction
of
human
nature
be
more
cause
of
suspicion
but
being
ancient
general
and
carried
on
without
difficulty
it
is
probably
as
little
dangerous
as
a
a
in
a
or
in
any
other
full
dress
place
where
young
people
meet
to
say
soft
things
to
each
other
in
an
antiquarian
tour
by
the
rev
bingley
in
we
also
find
the
following
description
of
this
custom
the
peasantry
of
part
of
caernarvonshire
anglesea
and
merionethshire
adopt
a
mode
of
which
till
within
the
last
few
years
was
scarcely
even
heard
of
in
england
it
is
the
same
that
is
common
in
many
parts
of
america
and
termed
by
the
inhabitants
of
that
country
the
lover
steals
under
the
shadow
of
the
night
to
the
bed
of
the
fair
one
into
which
retaining
an
essential
part
of
his
dress
he
is
admitted
without
any
shyness
or
reserve
saturday
or
sunday
nights
are
the
principal
times
when
this
courtship
takes
place
and
on
these
nights
the
men
sometimes
walk
from
a
distance
of
ten
miles
or
more
to
visit
their
favorite
damsels
this
strange
custom
seems
to
have
originated
in
the
scarcity
of
fuel
and
in
the
unpleasantness
of
sitting
together
in
the
colder
part
of
the
year
without
a
fire
much
has
been
said
of
the
innocence
with
which
these
meetings
are
conducted
but
it
is
a
very
common
thing
for
the
consequence
of
the
interview
to
make
its
appearance
in
the
world
within
two
or
three
months
after
the
marriage
ceremony
has
taken
place
the
subject
excites
no
particular
attention
among
the
neighbors
provided
the
marriage
be
made
good
before
the
living
witness
is
brought
to
light
since
this
custom
is
entirely
confined
to
the
laboring
classes
of
the
community
it
is
not
so
pregnant
with
danger
as
on
a
first
supposition
it
might
seem
both
parties
are
so
poor
that
they
are
necessarily
constrained
to
render
their
issue
legitimate
in
order
to
secure
their
reputation
and
with
a
mode
of
obtaining
a
livelihood
another
traveller
also
mentions
a
singular
custom
that
is
said
to
prevail
in
wales
relating
to
their
mode
of
courtship
which
is
declared
to
be
carried
on
in
bed
and
what
is
more
extraordinary
it
is
averred
that
the
moving
tale
of
love
is
agitated
in
that
situation
without
endangering
a
breach
in
the
preliminaries
referring
to
account
of
the
custom
before
quoted
he
proceeds
to
remark
our
companion
like
every
one
else
that
we
spoke
with
in
wales
on
the
subject
at
once
denied
the
existence
of
this
custom
that
maids
in
many
instances
admitted
male
he
did
not
doubt
but
that
the
procedure
was
sanctioned
by
he
considered
a
gross
misrepresentation
yet
in
anglesea
and
some
parts
of
north
wales
where
the
original
simplicity
of
manners
and
high
sense
of
chastity
of
the
natives
is
retained
he
admitted
of
the
might
appear
in
those
thinly
inhabited
districts
a
peasant
often
has
several
miles
to
walk
after
the
hours
of
labor
to
visit
his
mistress
those
who
have
reciprocally
entertained
the
will
easily
imagine
that
before
the
lovers
grow
tired
of
each
other
company
the
night
will
be
far
enough
advanced
nor
is
it
surprising
that
a
damsel
should
be
disinclined
to
turn
her
lover
out
over
bogs
and
mountains
until
the
dawn
of
day
the
fact
is
that
under
such
circumstances
she
admits
a
but
not
in
in
a
lonely
welsh
hut
this
bedding
has
not
the
alarm
of
ceremony
from
sitting
or
perhaps
lying
on
the
hearth
they
have
only
to
shift
their
quarters
to
a
heap
of
straw
or
fern
covered
with
two
or
three
blankets
in
a
neighboring
corner
the
practice
only
takes
place
with
view
of
still
another
glimpse
of
this
favorite
welsh
custom
is
presented
by
a
tourist
in
he
says
one
evening
at
an
inn
where
we
halted
we
heard
a
considerable
bustle
in
the
kitchen
and
upon
enquiry
i
was
let
into
a
secret
worth
knowing
the
landlord
had
been
scolding
one
of
his
maids
a
very
pretty
plump
little
girl
for
not
having
done
her
work
and
the
reason
which
she
alleged
for
her
idleness
was
that
her
master
having
locked
the
street
door
at
night
had
prevented
her
lover
enjoying
the
rights
and
delights
of
an
amatory
indulgence
which
considering
that
it
is
sanctioned
by
custom
may
be
regarded
as
somewhat
singular
although
it
is
not
exclusively
of
welsh
growth
the
process
is
very
simple
the
gay
lothario
when
all
is
silent
steals
to
the
chamber
of
his
mistress
who
receives
him
in
bed
but
with
the
modest
precaution
of
wearing
her
under
petticoat
which
is
always
fastened
at
the
bottom
not
unfrequently
i
am
told
by
a
sliding
knot
it
may
astonish
a
london
gallant
to
be
told
that
this
extraordinary
experiment
often
ends
in
downright
wedlock
the
knot
which
can
not
slide
a
gentleman
of
respectability
also
assured
me
that
he
was
obliged
to
indulge
his
female
servants
in
these
nocturnal
interviews
and
that
too
at
all
hours
of
the
night
otherwise
his
whole
family
would
be
thrown
into
disorder
by
their
neglect
the
carpet
would
not
be
dusted
nor
would
the
kettle
boil
i
think
this
custom
should
share
the
fate
of
the
northern
welsh
goats
habit
has
so
reconciled
the
mind
to
the
comforts
of
that
a
young
lady
who
entered
the
coach
soon
after
we
left
shrewsbury
about
eighteen
years
of
age
with
a
serene
and
modest
countenance
displayed
considerable
historical
knowledge
of
the
custom
without
one
touch
of
bashfulness
thus
much
for
wales
where
the
custom
seems
to
have
been
entirely
confined
to
the
lower
classes
of
society
and
where
we
have
reason
to
think
it
still
prevails
to
some
extent
to
this
day
the
same
author
whom
we
last
quoted
also
speaks
of
a
courtship
similar
to
carried
on
in
the
islands
of
vlie
and
wieringen
in
holland
under
the
name
of
at
night
the
lover
has
access
to
his
mistress
after
she
is
in
bed
and
upon
an
application
to
be
admitted
upon
the
bed
which
of
course
is
granted
he
raises
the
quilt
or
rug
and
in
this
state
or
enjoys
a
harmless
with
her
and
then
retires
this
custom
meets
with
the
perfect
sanction
of
the
most
circumspect
parents
and
the
freedom
is
seldom
abused
the
author
traces
its
origin
to
the
parsimony
of
the
people
whose
economy
considers
fire
and
candles
as
superfluous
luxuries
in
the
long
winter
evenings
the
hon
henry
murphy
of
brooklyn
late
united
states
minister
at
the
hague
has
furnished
us
with
the
following
note
in
relation
to
this
nederduitsche
custom
as
to
its
being
a
dutch
custom
it
was
so
to
a
limited
extent
in
holland
in
former
times
and
may
yet
be
though
i
did
not
hear
of
it
when
i
was
there
sewell
gives
the
word
or
in
his
dictionary
printed
over
a
century
ago
the
word
is
defined
in
the
dictionary
of
wieland
the
principal
lexicographer
in
that
country
as
follows
upon
the
islands
of
texel
and
vlieland
they
use
this
word
for
a
singular
custom
of
wooing
by
which
the
doors
and
windows
are
left
open
and
the
lover
lying
or
sitting
outside
the
covering
woos
the
girl
who
is
underneath
sewell
confines
the
custom
to
certain
islands
or
lands
near
the
sea
love
and
courtship
in
the
century
in
feudal
times
in
the
last
part
of
the
fourteenth
century
it
became
the
practice
for
the
vassals
or
feudatories
to
send
their
sons
to
be
educated
in
the
family
of
the
suzerain
while
the
daughters
were
similarly
placed
with
the
lady
of
the
castle
these
formed
a
very
important
part
of
the
household
and
were
of
gentle
blood
claiming
the
honorary
title
of
or
the
demoiselles
of
this
period
were
very
susceptible
to
the
passion
of
love
which
was
the
ruling
spirit
of
the
inmates
of
the
castle
feudal
society
was
in
comparison
to
the
previous
times
polished
and
even
brilliant
but
it
was
not
under
the
surface
pure
many
good
maxims
were
taught
but
they
were
not
all
practiced
there
was
an
extreme
intimacy
between
the
two
sexes
who
commonly
visited
each
other
in
their
chambers
or
bedrooms
thus
in
the
poem
of
guatier
the
hero
is
represented
as
visiting
in
her
chamber
the
demoiselle
of
whom
he
is
enamored
numerous
similar
examples
might
be
quoted
at
times
one
of
the
parties
is
described
as
being
actually
in
bed
as
is
the
case
in
the
romance
of
of
where
blonde
visits
jehan
in
his
chamber
when
he
is
in
bed
and
stays
all
night
with
him
in
perfect
innocence
as
we
are
told
in
the
romance
we
must
remember
that
it
was
the
custom
in
those
times
for
both
sexes
to
go
to
bed
perfectly
naked
in
switzerland
according
to
an
english
observer
analogous
modes
of
courtship
still
exist
in
speaking
of
the
canton
he
says
in
the
story
of
the
destruction
of
the
castles
we
read
that
the
surprise
was
effected
by
a
young
girl
admitting
her
lover
to
her
room
by
a
ladder
and
an
english
remarks
that
this
is
still
the
fashion
of
receiving
lovers
in
switzerland
reference
is
had
to
the
manner
of
wooing
which
in
some
cantons
is
called
in
others
and
and
answers
to
the
in
england
the
customs
connected
with
it
vary
in
different
cantons
but
exist
in
some
form
in
all
except
two
or
three
in
the
canon
the
is
the
universal
mode
of
wooing
the
lover
visiting
his
betrothed
in
the
evening
to
be
pelted
on
the
way
by
all
mischievous
urchins
or
if
he
is
seated
quietly
with
her
by
the
winter
fire
they
are
sure
to
be
serenaded
by
all
manner
of
under
the
window
which
are
continued
till
he
issues
forth
perhaps
at
dawn
in
the
morning
and
however
long
may
be
a
courtship
these
are
the
invariable
attendants
and
not
the
most
lamentable
consequences
of
these
nightly
visits
recognized
however
as
entirely
respectable
and
conventional
in
every
canton
and
again
in
the
canton
he
says
the
or
nightly
wooings
are
the
universal
custom
with
the
universal
consequences
but
in
general
the
wife
is
treated
with
marked
respect
is
made
keeper
of
the
treasury
and
consulted
as
the
oracle
of
the
family
among
the
amatory
customs
of
various
savage
nations
and
tribes
there
are
certain
which
somewhat
resemble
except
in
the
greater
degree
of
freedom
allowed
a
freedom
which
in
the
eyes
of
civilized
nations
is
absolute
immorality
of
this
description
is
the
manner
of
wooing
described
by
la
hontan
as
prevalent
among
the
indians
of
north
america
yet
in
many
of
these
instances
if
we
were
to
carefully
examine
the
social
system
and
customs
of
our
savage
friends
and
were
willing
to
judge
them
rather
by
the
results
of
our
own
observation
than
by
our
preconceived
opinions
we
should
probably
find
that
the
absolute
of
these
was
quite
equal
if
not
superior
to
that
of
the
educated
and
civilized
whites
among
these
de
however
to
which
we
have
alluded
as
existing
among
different
savage
tribes
there
are
none
which
bear
so
perfect
a
resemblance
to
as
that
described
by
masson
in
his
in
central
asia
belochistan
afghanistan
etc
iii
he
says
many
of
the
afghan
tribes
have
a
custom
of
wooing
similar
to
what
in
wales
is
known
as
and
which
they
term
the
lover
presents
himself
at
the
house
of
his
betrothed
with
a
suitable
gift
and
in
return
is
allowed
to
pass
the
night
with
her
on
the
understanding
that
innocent
endearments
are
not
to
be
exceeded
spencer
john
tells
us
in
speaking
of
the
piratical
and
ferocious
sea
dayaks
of
borneo
that
besides
the
ordinary
attention
which
a
young
man
is
able
to
pay
to
the
girl
he
desires
to
make
his
wife
as
helping
her
in
her
farm
work
and
in
carrying
home
her
load
of
vegetables
or
wood
as
well
as
in
making
her
little
presents
as
a
ring
or
some
brass
with
which
the
women
adorn
their
waists
or
even
a
petticoat
there
is
a
very
peculiar
testimony
of
regard
which
is
worthy
of
note
about
nine
or
ten
at
night
when
the
family
is
supposed
to
be
fast
asleep
within
the
musquito
curtains
in
the
private
apartments
the
young
man
quietly
slips
back
the
bolt
by
which
the
door
is
fastened
on
the
inside
and
enters
the
room
on
tiptoe
on
hearing
who
it
is
she
rises
at
once
and
they
sit
conversing
together
and
making
arrangements
for
the
future
in
the
dark
over
a
plentiful
supply
of
and
which
it
is
the
gentleman
duty
to
provide
for
his
suit
is
in
a
fair
way
to
prosper
but
if
on
the
other
hand
she
rises
and
says
good
enough
to
blow
up
the
fire
or
the
lamp
a
bamboo
filled
with
resin
then
his
hopes
are
at
an
end
as
that
is
the
usual
form
of
dismissal
of
course
if
this
kind
of
nocturnal
visit
is
frequently
repeated
the
parents
do
not
fail
to
discover
it
although
it
is
a
point
of
honor
among
them
to
take
no
notice
of
their
visitor
and
if
they
approve
of
him
matters
then
take
their
course
but
if
not
they
use
their
influence
with
their
daughter
to
ensure
the
utterance
of
the
fatal
blow
up
the
fire
and
now
having
discussed
the
custom
of
bundling
as
it
formerly
existed
in
great
britain
and
having
proved
its
identity
with
the
of
holland
and
the
of
central
asia
we
propose
to
follow
our
investigations
to
the
continent
of
america
and
to
trace
if
we
can
its
origin
and
progress
in
the
united
states
of
america
in
doing
which
it
is
quite
likely
that
we
follow
the
identical
line
of
travel
and
colonization
viz
from
old
to
new
england
and
from
netherlands
the
to
new
netherlands
by
which
the
custom
of
bundling
was
really
transplanted
to
these
western
shores
for
although
the
grave
and
sometimes
veracious
historian
of
new
york
diedrich
knickerbocker
hath
endeavored
to
fasten
upon
the
connecticut
settlers
the
odium
of
having
introduced
the
custom
into
new
netherland
to
the
great
offense
of
all
properly
disposed
people
yet
we
may
reasonably
doubt
whether
the
young
mynheers
and
frauliens
of
new
amsterdam
in
that
day
were
any
more
innocent
of
this
lover
pastime
than
their
vivacious
connecticut
neighbors
indeed
can
it
be
for
one
moment
supposed
that
the
good
hollanders
a
most
unchanging
and
conservative
race
should
have
been
so
far
false
to
the
traditions
of
their
fathers
and
the
honor
of
the
fatherland
as
to
leave
behind
them
when
they
crossed
the
seas
the
good
old
custom
of
with
its
associations
and
delights
or
can
it
be
imagined
that
those
astute
lawgivers
and
political
economists
the
early
governors
and
burgomasters
were
so
blind
to
the
necessities
and
interests
of
a
new
and
sparsely
populated
country
as
to
forbid
bundling
within
their
borders
indeed
it
would
be
but
a
sorry
compliment
to
the
wisdom
of
that
sagacious
and
body
of
merchants
comprised
in
the
high
and
mighty
west
india
company
to
believe
that
they
were
unwilling
to
introduce
under
their
benign
auspices
a
custom
so
intimately
connected
with
their
own
national
social
habits
and
so
promising
to
the
prospective
interests
and
enlargement
of
their
as
this
and
truly
diedrich
himself
doth
in
another
part
of
his
book
inadvertently
betray
the
fact
that
bundling
was
by
no
means
a
purely
yankee
trick
for
he
speaks
of
the
redoubtable
anthony
van
corlaer
purest
of
dutchmen
as
passing
through
hartford
and
pyquag
and
middletown
and
all
the
other
border
towns
twanging
his
trumpet
like
a
very
devil
so
that
the
sweet
valleys
and
banks
of
the
connecticut
resounded
with
the
warlike
melody
and
stopping
occasionally
to
eat
pumpkin
pies
dance
at
country
frolics
and
with
the
beauteous
lasses
of
those
parts
whom
he
rejoiced
exceedingly
with
his
instrument
which
passage
while
it
proves
that
the
practice
of
bundling
prevailed
in
connecticut
proves
equally
well
that
anthony
the
trumpeter
was
by
no
means
inexperienced
in
its
delights
nor
unwilling
to
enjoy
its
comforts
whether
under
the
name
of
or
indeed
we
do
most
truly
believe
that
the
cunning
knickerbocker
in
his
desire
to
vindicate
as
he
thought
the
character
of
his
race
against
the
accusation
of
immorality
hath
by
his
denial
not
only
committed
a
grievous
sin
against
the
truth
of
history
but
hath
greatly
added
thereto
by
attempting
to
foist
off
the
opprobrium
of
the
same
on
to
the
shoulders
of
the
connecticut
folks
but
history
will
not
remain
forever
falsified
and
the
day
has
at
length
arrived
when
every
historical
tub
must
stand
on
its
own
bottom
and
the
world
will
henceforth
know
that
the
new
netherlanders
did
not
take
bundling
by
inoculation
from
the
yankees
but
that
they
brought
it
with
them
to
the
new
world
as
an
ancestral
heirloom
this
point
being
thus
satisfactorily
settled
to
the
honor
of
the
dutchman
and
the
extreme
satisfaction
of
all
future
historians
we
next
proceed
to
investigate
the
bundling
prevalent
in
the
new
england
states
where
as
we
have
already
shown
it
was
as
with
the
dutchmen
an
custom
its
comparatively
innocent
and
harmless
character
has
however
been
fearfully
distorted
and
maligned
by
irresponsible
satirists
and
prejudiced
historians
take
for
example
the
following
passage
from
knickerbocker
of
new
wherein
he
pretends
to
describe
the
curious
device
among
these
sturdy
barbarians
the
connecticut
colonists
to
keep
up
a
harmony
of
interests
and
promote
population
they
multiplied
to
a
degree
which
would
be
incredible
to
any
man
unacquainted
with
the
marvellous
fecundity
of
this
growing
country
this
amazing
increase
may
indeed
be
partly
ascribed
to
a
singular
custom
prevalent
among
them
commonly
known
by
the
name
of
a
superstitious
rite
observed
by
the
young
people
of
both
sexes
with
which
they
usually
terminated
their
festivities
and
which
was
kept
up
with
religious
strictness
by
the
more
bigoted
and
vulgar
part
of
the
community
this
ceremony
was
likewise
in
those
primitive
times
considered
as
an
indispensable
preliminary
to
matrimony
their
courtships
commencing
where
ours
usually
finish
by
which
means
they
acquired
that
intimate
acquaintance
with
each
other
good
qualities
before
marriage
which
has
been
pronounced
by
philosophers
the
sure
basis
of
a
happy
union
thus
early
did
this
cunning
and
ingenious
people
display
a
shrewdness
at
making
a
bargain
which
has
ever
since
distinguished
them
and
a
strict
adherence
to
the
good
old
vulgar
maxim
about
a
pig
in
a
poke
to
this
sagacious
custom
therefore
do
i
chiefly
attribute
the
unparalleled
increase
of
the
yanokie
or
yankee
tribe
for
it
is
a
certain
fact
well
authenticated
by
court
records
and
parish
registers
that
wherever
the
practice
of
bundling
prevailed
there
was
an
amazing
number
of
sturdy
brats
annually
born
unto
the
state
without
the
license
of
the
law
or
the
benefit
of
clergy
neither
did
the
irregularity
of
their
birth
operate
in
the
least
to
their
disparagement
on
the
contrary
they
grew
up
a
hardy
race
of
whoreson
whalers
wood
cutters
fishermen
and
peddlers
and
strapping
wenches
who
by
their
united
efforts
tended
marvellously
towards
populating
those
notable
tracts
of
country
called
nantucket
piscataway
and
cape
cod
hear
also
that
learned
but
audacious
and
unscrupulous
divine
the
rev
samuel
peters
who
thus
discourseth
at
length
upon
the
custom
of
bundling
in
connecticut
and
other
parts
of
new
england
after
admitting
that
the
women
of
connecticut
are
strictly
virtuous
and
to
be
compared
to
the
prude
rather
than
the
european
polite
lady
he
says
notwithstanding
the
modesty
of
the
females
is
such
that
it
would
be
accounted
the
greatest
rudeness
for
a
gentleman
to
speak
before
a
lady
of
a
garter
knee
or
leg
yet
it
is
thought
but
a
piece
of
civility
to
ask
her
to
a
custom
as
old
as
the
first
settlement
in
it
is
certainly
innocent
virtuous
and
prudent
or
the
puritans
would
not
have
permitted
it
to
prevail
among
their
offspring
for
whom
in
general
they
would
suffer
crucifixion
children
brought
up
with
the
chastest
ideas
with
so
much
religion
as
to
believe
that
the
omniscient
god
sees
them
in
the
dark
and
that
angels
guard
them
when
absent
from
their
parents
will
not
nay
can
not
act
a
wicked
thing
people
who
are
influenced
more
by
lust
than
a
serious
faith
in
god
who
is
too
pure
to
behold
iniquity
with
approbation
ought
never
to
if
any
man
thus
a
stranger
to
the
love
of
virtue
of
god
and
the
christian
religion
should
with
a
young
lady
in
new
england
and
behave
himself
unseemly
towards
her
he
must
first
melt
her
into
passion
and
expel
heaven
death
and
hell
from
her
mind
or
he
will
undergo
the
chastisement
of
negroes
turned
mad
if
he
escape
with
life
it
will
be
owing
to
the
parents
flying
from
their
bed
to
protect
him
the
indians
who
had
this
method
of
courtship
when
the
english
arrived
among
them
in
are
the
most
chaste
set
of
people
in
the
world
concubinage
and
fornication
are
vices
none
of
them
are
addicted
to
except
such
as
forsake
the
laws
of
hobbamockow
and
turn
christians
the
savages
have
taken
many
female
prisoners
carried
them
back
three
hundred
miles
into
their
country
and
kept
them
several
years
and
yet
not
a
single
instance
of
their
violating
the
laws
of
chastity
has
ever
been
known
this
can
not
be
said
of
the
french
or
of
the
english
whenever
indian
or
other
women
have
fallen
into
their
hands
i
am
no
advocate
for
temptation
yet
must
say
that
has
prevailed
years
in
new
england
and
i
verily
believe
with
ten
times
more
chastity
than
the
sitting
on
a
sofa
i
had
daughters
and
speak
from
near
forty
experience
takes
place
only
in
cold
seasons
of
the
year
the
sofa
in
summer
is
more
dangerous
than
the
bed
in
winter
about
the
year
boston
salem
newport
and
new
york
resolving
to
be
more
polite
than
their
ancestors
forbade
their
daughters
on
the
bed
with
any
young
man
whatever
and
introduced
a
sofa
to
render
courtship
more
palatable
and
turkish
whatever
it
was
owing
to
whether
to
the
sofa
or
any
uncommon
excess
of
the
there
went
abroad
a
report
that
this
produced
more
then
all
the
among
the
boors
with
their
through
every
village
in
new
england
besides
in
a
clergyman
from
one
of
the
polite
towns
went
into
the
country
and
preached
against
the
unchristian
custom
of
young
men
and
maidens
lying
together
on
a
bed
he
was
no
sooner
out
of
the
church
then
attacked
by
a
shoal
of
good
old
women
with
do
you
think
we
and
our
daughters
are
naughty
because
we
allow
lead
yourselves
into
temptation
by
it
they
all
replied
at
once
have
you
been
told
thus
or
has
experience
taught
it
you
the
levite
began
to
lift
up
his
eyes
and
to
consider
of
his
situation
and
bowing
said
have
been
told
so
the
ladies
bawled
out
informants
sir
we
conclude
are
those
city
ladies
who
prefer
a
sofa
to
a
bed
we
advise
you
to
alter
your
sermon
by
substituting
the
word
for
and
on
your
return
home
preach
it
to
them
for
experience
has
told
us
that
city
folks
send
more
children
into
the
country
without
fathers
or
mothers
to
own
them
than
are
born
among
us
therefore
you
see
a
sofa
is
more
dangerous
than
a
bed
the
poor
priest
seemingly
convinced
of
his
blunder
exclaimed
vitia
nostra
neo
remedia
pati
hoping
thereby
to
get
rid
of
his
guests
but
an
old
matron
pulled
off
her
spectacles
and
looking
the
priest
in
the
face
like
a
roman
heroine
said
putare
me
hæc
auribus
tuis
others
cried
out
to
the

to
explain
his
latin

said
he
this

that
i
sojourn
in
meseck
and
dwell
in
the
tents
of
kedar
one
pertly
retorted
decussati

the
priest
confessed
his
error
begged
pardon
and
promised
never
more
to
preach
against
bundling
or
to
think
amiss
of
the
custom
the
ladies
generously
forgave
him
and
went
away
it
may
seem
very
strange
to
find
this
custom
of
bundling
in
bed
attended
with
so
much
innocence
in
new
england
while
in
europe
it
is
thought
not
safe
or
scarcely
decent
to
permit
a
young
man
and
maid
to
be
together
in
private
anywhere
but
in
this
quarter
of
the
old
world
the
viciousness
of
the
one
and
the
simplicity
of
the
other
are
the
result
merely
of
education
and
habit
it
seems
to
be
a
part
of
heroism
among
the
polished
nations
of
it
to
sacrifice
the
virtuous
fair
one
whenever
an
opportunity
offers
and
thence
it
is
concluded
that
the
same
principles
actuate
those
of
the
new
world
it
is
egregiously
absurd
to
judge
all
of
all
countries
by

the
most
amiable
she
sees
no

persecution
and
is
the
cause
of
her
seeing
that
my
insular
readers
will
i
hope
believe
me
when
i
tell
them
that
i
have
seen
in
the
west
indies
naked
boys
and
girls
some
fifteen
or
sixteen
years
of
age
waiting
at
table
and
at
tea
even
when
twenty
or
thirty
virtuous
english
ladies
were
in
the
room
who
were
under
no
more
embarrassment
at
such
an
awful
sight
in
the
eyes
of
english
people
that
have
not
traveled
abroad
than
they
would
have
been
at
the
sight
of
so
many
servants
in
livery
shall
we
censure
the
ladies
of
the
west
indies
as
vicious
above
all
their
sex
on
account
of
this
local
custom
by
no
means
for
long
experience
has
taught
the
world
that
the
west
indian
white
ladies
are
virtuous
prudes
where
superstition
reigns
fanaticism
will
be
minister
of
state
and
the
people
under
the
taxation
of
zeal
will
shun
what
is
commonly
called
vice
with
ten
times
more
care
than
the
polite
and
civilized
christians
who
know
what
is
right
and
what
is
wrong
from
reason
and
revelation
happy
would
it
be
for
the
world
if
reason
and
revelation
were
suffered
to
control
the
mind
and
passions
of
the
great
and
wise
men
of
the
earth
as
superstition
does
that
of
the
simple
and
less
polished
when
america
shall
erect
societies
for
the
promotion
of
chastity
in
europe
in
return
for
the
establishment
of
european
arts
in
the
american
capitals
then
europe
will
discover
that
there
is
more
christian
philosophy
in
american
bundling
than
can
be
found
in
the
customs
of
nations
more
polite
i
should
not
have
said
so
much
about
bundling
had
not
a
learned
divine
of
the
english
church
published
his
travels
through
some
parts
of
america
wherein
this
remarkable
custom
is
represented
in
an
unfavorable
light
and
as
prevailing
among
the
of
people
the
truth
is
the
custom
prevails
among
all
classes
to
the
great
honor
of
the
country
its
religion
and
ladies
the
virtuous
may
be
tempted
but
the
tempter
is
despised
why
it
should
be
thought
incredible
for
a
young
man
and
young
woman
innocently
and
virtuously
to
lie
down
together
in
a
bed
with
a
great
part
of
their
clothes
on
i
can
not
conceive
human
passions
may
be
alike
in
every
region
but
religion
diversified
as
it
is
operates
differently
in
different
countries
upon
the
whole
had
i
daughters
now
i
would
venture
to
let
them
on
the
bed
or
even
on
the
sofa
after
a
proper
education
sooner
than
adopt
the
spanish
mode
of
forcing
young
people
to
prattle
only
before
the
lady
mother
the
chitchat
of
artless
lovers
could
the
four
quarters
of
the
world
produce
a
more
chaste
exemplary
and
beautiful
company
of
wives
and
daughters
than
are
in
connecticut
i
should
not
have
remaining
one
favorable
sentiment
for
the
province
but
the
soil
the
rivers
the
ponds
the
ten
thousand
landscapes
together
with
the
virtuous
and
lovely
women
which
now
adorn
the
ancient
kingdoms
of
connecticote
sassacus
and
quinnipiog
would
tempt
me
into
the
highest
wonder
and
admiration
of
them
could
they
once
be
freed
ofthe
skunk
the
rattlesnake
and
fanatic
christian
or
to
take
another
example
of
the
abuse
heaped
by
our
english
cousins
upon
this
american
custom
of
bundling
we
extract
the
following
from
an
article
entitled
abuse
of
american
published
in
it
seems
that
it
had
long
been
a
custom
in
the
westminster
school
in
the
city
of
london
for
the
senior
students
who
were
about
to
leave
that
seminary
for
the
university
at
the
age
of
sixteen
to
eighteen
to
have
an
annual
dramatic
performance
which
was
generally
a
play
of
terence
to
this
as
annually
performed
there
was
usually
a
latin
prologue
and
also
an
epilogue
composed
for
the
occasion
and
this
epilogue
turned
for
the
most
part
on
the
manners
of
the
day
that
would
bear
the
gentle
correction
of
good
humored
satire
in
elegant
latinity
in
the
epilogue
presented
at
one
of
these
exhibitions
about
in
connection
with
the
performance
of
terence
the
following
balderdash
with
much
else
as
applied
to
american
life
and
manners
was
introduced
and
spoken
by
these
ingenuous
and
virtuous
british
youth
before
a
large
and
enlightened
audience

a

too
we
hear
of
the
practice

without
any

of
female
modesty

the
chaste
maiden
without
any
deception

with
right
good

chaste

oh
what
nights

worthy
of
the

what
delightful
customs
among
these
pious
people

this
spirit
of
misrepresentation
and
ridicule
so
glaringly
apparent
in
the
foregoing
extracts
and
which
has
so
universally
characterized
all
those
british
travelers
and
authors
who
have
attempted
to
describe

social

manners
is
fitly
rebuked
even
as
long
ago
as
by
an
anonymous
writer
whose
trenchant
pen
reminds
our
british
cousins
of
the
old

concerning

is
a
littleness
in
noticing
in

work

heretofore
has
been
distinguished
for
its
taste
chasteness
and
celebrity
the
observation
of

mean

mention

they
were

of
the
united
states
without
enjoying
the
luxury
of
a
soft
couch
and
clean
sheets
where
he
can
ruminate
on
the
injustice
he
attempts
on
our
national
character
badinage
ridicule
and
misrepresentation
aside
however
there
can
be
no
reasonable
doubt
that
did
prevail
to
a
very
great
extent
in
the
new
england
colonies
from
a
very
early
date
it
is
equally
evident
that
it
was
originally
confined
almost
entirely
to
the
lower
classes
of
the
community
or
to
those
whose
limited
means
compelled
them
to
economize
strictly
in
their
expenditure
of
firewood
and
candlelight
many
perhaps
the
majority
of
the
dwellings
of
the
early
settlers
consisted
of
but
one
room
in
which
the
whole
family
lived
and
slept
yet
their
innocent
and
generous
hospitality
forbade
that
the
stranger
or
the
friend
whom
night
overtook
on
their
threshold
should
be
turned
shelterless
and
couchless
away
so
long
as
they
could
offer
him
even
half
of
a
bed
as
an
example
of
this
we
may
cite
the
case
of
lieut
anbury
a
british
officer
who
served
in
america
during
the
revolutionary
war
and
whose
letters
preserve
many
sprightly
and
interesting
pictures
of
the
manners
and
customs
of
that
period
in
a
letter
dated
at
cambridge
new
england
november
he
thus
speaks
the
night
before
we
came
to
this
town
williamstown
mass
being
quartered
at
a
small
log
hut
i
was
convinced
in
how
innocent
a
view
the
americans
look
upon
that
indelicate
custom
they
call
though
they
have
remarkable
good
feather
beds
and
are
extremely
neat
and
clean
still
i
preferred
my
hard
mattress
as
being
accustomed
to
it
this
evening
however
owing
to
the
badness
of
the
roads
and
the
weakness
of
my
mare
my
servant
had
not
arrived
with
my
baggage
at
the
time
for
retiring
to
rest
there
being
only
two
beds
in
the
house
i
inquired
which
i
was
to
sleep
in
when
the
old
woman
replied
ensign
here
i
should
observe
to
you
that
the
new
england
people
are
very
inquisitive
as
to
the
rank
you
have
in
the
army
ensign
says
she
jonathan
and
i
will
sleep
in
this
and
our
jemima
and
you
shall
sleep
in
that
i
was
much
astonished
at
such
a
proposal
and
offered
to
sit
up
all
night
when
jonathan
immediately
replied
la
ensign
you
wont
be
the
first
man
our
jemima
has
bundled
with
will
it
jemima
when
little
jemima
who
by
the
bye
was
a
very
pretty
girl
of
about
sixteen
or
seventeen
archly
replied
father
not
by
many
but
it
will
be
with
the
first
britainer
the
name
they
give
to
englishmen
in
this
dilemma
what
could
i
do
the
smiling
invitation
of
pretty
jemima
the
eye
the
lip
the
lord
ha
mercy
where
am
i
going
to
but
wherever
i
may
be
going
now
i
did
not
go
to
bundle
with
her
in
the
same
room
with
her
father
and
mother
my
kind
and
too
i
thought
of
that
i
thought
of
more
besides
to
struggle
with
the
passions
of
nature
to
clasp
jemima
in
my
arms
to
do
what
you
ask
why
to
do
nothing
for
if
amid
all
these
temptations
the
lovely
jemima
had
melted
into
kindness
she
had
been
an
outcast
from
the
world
treated
with
contempt
abused
by
violence
and
left
perhaps
to
perish
no
jemima
i
could
have
endured
all
this
to
have
been
blest
with
you
but
it
was
too
vast
a
sacrifice
when
you
was
to
be
the
victim
suppose
how
great
the
test
of
virtue
must
be
or
how
cold
the
american
constitution
when
this
unaccountable
custom
is
in
hospitable
repute
and
perpetual
practice
again
in
a
subsequent
letter
the
lieutenant
after
describing
a
new
england
sleighing
frolic
says
in
england
this
would
be
esteemed
extremely
imprudent
and
attended
with
dangerous
consequences
but
after
what
i
have
related
respecting
i
need
not
say
in
how
innocent
a
view
this
is
looked
upon
apropos
as
to
that
custom
along
the
sea
coast
by
a
continual
intercourse
among
europeans
it
is
in
some
measure
abolished
but
they
still
retain
one
something
similar
which
is
termed
when
a
young
man
is
enamored
of
a
woman
and
wishes
to
marry
her
he
proposes
the
affair
to
her
parents
without
whose
consent
no
marriage
in
this
colony
can
take
place
if
they
have
no
objections
he
is
allowed
to
tarry
with
her
one
night
in
order
to
make
his
court
at
the
usual
time
the
old
couple
retire
to
bed
leaving
the
young
ones
to
settle
matters
as
they
can
who
having
sat
up
as
long
as
they
think
proper
get
into
bed
together
also
but
without
putting
off
their
under
garments
to
prevent
scandal
if
the
parties
agree
it
is
all
very
well
the
banns
are
published
and
they
married
without
delay
if
not
they
part
and
possibly
never
see
each
other
again
unless
which
is
an
accident
that
seldom
happens
the
forsaken
fair
proves
pregnant
in
which
case
the
man
unless
he
absconds
is
obliged
to
marry
her
on
pain
of
excommunication
the
word
in
the
sense
of
or
was
more
used
by
our
ancestors
than
by
the
present
generation
yet
we
think
that
lieut
anbury
was
mistaken
in
his
idea
that
the
was
but
for
a
single
night
it
is
true
that
marriages
were
early
and
probably
the
courtships
were
short
but
we
all
know
enough
of
new
england
to
know
that
a
single
night
was
cutting
it
rather
short
and
yet
it
is
easy
to
see
how
anbury
should
get
his
erroneous
idea
true
if
the
lover
was
so
unlucky
as
to
get
his
final
dismissal
the
first
night
there
was
an
end
of
the
matter
and
well
might
they
fail
to
meet
again
but
in
that
case
it
is
not
likely
that
the
favors
of
which
he
could
boast
would
be
such
as
to
seriously
affect
the
reputation
of
the
girl
with
whom
he
tarried
the
fact
that
in
the
custom
of
the
parties
also
does
not
authorize
the
synonymous
use
of
the
two
words
which
have
nothing
in
common
for
doubtless
many
young
men
with
their
sweethearts
who
did
not
with
them
again
when
on
a
sabbath
night
the
faithful
swain
arrived
having
perhaps
walked
ten
or
more
weary
miles
to
enjoy
the
company
of
his
favorite
lass
in
the
few
brief
hours
which
would
elapse
before
the
morning
light
should
call
him
again
to
his
homeward
walk
and
his
week
of
toil
was
it
not
the
dictate
of
humanity
as
well
as
of
economy
which
prompted
the
to
allow
the
approved
and
accepted
suitor
of
their
daughter
to
pursue
his
wooing
under
the
downy
coverlid
of
a
good
feather
bed
oftentimes
too
in
the
very
same
room
in
which
they
themselves
slept
rather
than
to
have
them
and
out
firewood
and
to
say
nothing
of
the
risk
of
catching
their
a
indeed
was
not
the
sanction
of
bundling
in
such
cases
a
tacit
admission
on
the
part
of
the
parents
of
their
perfect
confidence
in
the
young
folks
which
necessarily
acted
upon
the
latter
as
at
once
a
strong
restraint
from
wrong
and
a
strong
incentive
to
right
doing
the
influence
of
early
religious
training
the
powerful
control
which
the
church
had
obtained
upon
the
social
and
domestic
life
of
the
people
and
the
superstitious
aspect
which
in
those
days
the
gospel
was
made
to
wear
must
also
be
taken
into
the
account
and
moreover
is
it
not
probable
that
the
universality
of
the
custom
which
certainly
cleared
it
from
anything
like
odium
or
reproach
would
naturally
tend
to
preclude
in
a
degree
any
improper
ideas
in
the
minds
of
those
who
practiced
it
such
then
we
consider
the
of
the
custom
in
the
earlier
history
of
the
colonies
and
among
the
of
settlers
but
if
the
reader
will
allow
us
to
quote
from
a
previous
work
the
emigration
from
a
civilized
to
a
new
country
is
necessarily
a
step
backward
into
barbarism
the
did
not
fill
the
place
of
the
fathers
reared
amid
the
trials
and
dangers
of
a
new
settlement
they
were
in
a
great
measure
deprived
of
the
advantages
both
social
and
educational
which
their
parents
had
enjoyed
nearly
all
of
the
former
could
write
which
can
not
be
said
of
their
children
neither
did
the
latter
possess
that
depth
of
religious
feeling
or
earnest
practical
piety
which
distinguished
the
first
comers
religion
was
to
them
less
a
matter
of
the
heart
than
of
social
privilege
and
in
the
way
controversy
we
behold
the
gradual
down
of
between
a
pure
church
and
a
grasping
world
the
generation
followed
in
the
footsteps
of
their
predecessors
then
came
war
and
young
new
england
brought
from
the
long
canadian
campaigns
stores
of
loose
camp
vices
and
recklessness
which
soon
flooded
the
land
with
immorality
and
infidelity
the
church
was
neglected
drunkenness
fearfully
increased
and
social
life
was
sadly
corrupted
it
is
not
therefore
a
matter
of
surprise
that
bundling
should
in
the
increased
laxity
of
public
morals
become
more
frequently
abused
its
pernicious
effects
became
constantly
more
apparent
and
more
decidedly
challenged
the
attention
of
the
comparatively
few
godly
men
who
endeavored
to
stem
and
to
control
the
rapidly
widening
current
of
immorality
which
threatened
to
overwhelm
the
land
the
powerful
intellect
of
jonathan
edwards
thundered
its
anathemas
upon
it
pious
divines
prayed
against
it
in
their
closets
and
wrestled
with
it
in
their
pulpits
while
many
attempted
by
a
revision
of
their
church
polity
by
greater
carefulness
in
the
admission
of
members
by
rules
more
stringently
framed
and
enforced
to
preserve
as
best
they
might
the
purity
of
the
churches
committed
to
their
charge
and
to
make
them
if
it
were
possible
beacon
lights
amid
the
surrounding
darkness
of
the
times
the
task
however
was
well
nigh
hopeless
the
french
wars
were
succeeded
by
that
of
the
american
revolution
and
not
before
the
close
of
that
struggle
may
the
custom
of
bundling
be
said
to
have
received
its
deathblow
and
even
then
it
its
final
disuse
was
brought
about
by
a
variety
of
causes
among
which
may
be
named
the
improved
condition
of
the
people
after
the
revolution
enabling
many
to
live
in
larger
and
better
warmed
houses
and
in
the
very
few
places
where
the
ministers
dared
to
touch
the
subject
in
the
pulpit
as
in
dedham
already
referred
to
a
decided
effect
was
produced
but
it
was
confined
to
the
neighborhood
having
very
little
effect
on
the
general
custom
probably
no
single
thing
tended
so
much
to
break
up
the
practice
as
the
publication
of
a
song
or
ballad
in
an
almanac
about
this
ballad
described
in
a
free
and
easy
style
the
various
plans
adopted
by
those
who
bundled
and
rather
more
than
hinted
at
the
results
in
certain
cases
being
published
in
an
almanac
it
had
a
much
larger
circulation
than
could
have
been
obtained
for
it
in
any
other
way
tract
societies
not
being
then
in
vogue
and
the
descriptions
were
so
that
each
one
who
saw
them
was
disposed
to
apply
them
in
a
joking
way
to
any
other
who
was
known
to
practice
bundling
and
the
result
was
such
a
general
storm
of
banter
and
ridicule
that
no
girl
had
the
courage
to
stand
against
it
and
continue
to
admit
her
lovers
to
her
bed
we
have
found
many
persons
who
distinctly
remember
the
publication
of
this
song
and
the
effect
which
it
had
on
the
public
mind
but
all
our
efforts
to
find
the
almanac
containing
it
have
proved
of
no
avail
we
have
however
been
favored
with
the
use
of
a
broadside
copy
of
a
ballad
preserved
among
the
treasures
of
the
american
antiquarian
society
at
worcester
massachusetts
which
several
of
our
ancient
friends
have
recognized
as
identical
with
that
in
the
almanac
one
of
them
proving
it
by
repeating
from
memory
several
lines
from
the
almanac
version
which
were
precisely
like
that
of
the
broadside
a
copy
of
which
we
give
herewith
a
new
bundling
song
a
reproof
to
those
young
country
women
who
follow
that
reproachful
practice
and
to
their
mothers
for
upholding
them
since
bundling
very
much
abounds
in
many
parts
in
country
towns
no
doubt
but
some
will
spurn
my
song
and
say
i
better
hold
my
tongue
but
none
i
sure
will
take
offence
or
deem
my
song
impertinence
but
only
those
who
guilty
be
and
plainly
here
their
pictures
see
some
maidens
say
if
through
the
nation
bundling
should
quite
go
out
of
fashion
courtship
would
lose
its
sweets
and
they
could
have
no
fun
till
wedding
day
it
shant
be
so
they
rage
and
storm
and
country
girls
in
clusters
swarm
and
fly
and
buz
like
angry
bees
and
vow
they
bundle
when
they
please
some
mothers
too
will
plead
their
cause
and
give
their
daughters
great
applause
and
tell
them
is
no
sin
nor
shame
for
we
your
mothers
did
the
same
we
hope
the
custom
will
alter
but
wish
its
enemies
a
halter
dissatisfaction
great
appear
in
several
places
where
they
heard
their
preacher
bold
aloud
disclaim
that
bundling
is
a
burning
shame
this
too
was
cause
of
direful
rout
and
talk
and
told
of
all
about
that
ministers
should
disapprove
sparks
courting
in
a
bed
of
love
so
justified
the
custom
more
than
was
heard
or
known
before
the
pulpit
then
it
seems
must
yield
and
female
valor
take
the
field
in
places
where
their
custom
long
increasing
strength
has
grown
so
strong
when
mothers
herein
bear
a
sway
and
daughters
joyfully
obey
and
young
men
highly
pleased
too
good
lord
what
ca
the
devil
do
can
this
vile
practice
be
broke
is
there
no
way
to
give
a
stroke
to
wound
it
or
to
strike
it
dead
and
girls
with
sparks
not
go
to
bed
strike
them
more
than
preacher
tongue
to
let
the
world
know
what
they
done
and
let
it
be
in
common
fame
held
up
to
view
a
noted
shame
young
miss
if
this
your
practice
be
i
teach
you
now
yourself
to
see
you
plead
you
honest
modest
too
but
such
a
plea
will
never
do
for
how
can
modesty
consist
with
shameful
practice
such
as
this
i
give
your
answer
to
the
life
you
do
undress
like
man
wife
that
is
your
plea
i
freely
own
but
whose
your
bondsmen
when
alone
that
further
rules
you
will
not
break
and
marriage
liberties
partake
some
really
do
as
i
suppose
upon
design
keep
on
some
clothes
and
yet
in
truth
i
not
afraid
for
to
describe
a
bundling
maid
she
sometimes
say
when
she
lies
down
she
ca
be
cumber
with
a
gown
and
that
the
weather
is
so
warm
to
take
it
off
can
be
no
harm
the
girl
it
seems
had
been
at
strift
for
widest
bosom
to
her
shift
she
gownless
when
the
bed
they
in
the
spark
nought
feels
but
naked
skin
but
she
is
modest
also
chaste
while
only
bare
from
neck
to
waist
and
he
of
boasted
freedom
sings
of
all
above
her
apron
strings
and
where
such
freedoms
great
are
and
further
freedoms
feebly
bar
i
leave
for
others
to
relate
how
long
she
keep
her
virgin
state
another
pretty
lass
we
scan
that
loves
to
bundle
with
a
man
for
many
different
ways
they
take
through
modest
rules
they
all
will
break
some
clothes
i
keep
on
she
will
say
for
that
has
always
been
my
way
nor
would
i
be
quite
naked
found
with
spark
in
bed
for
thousand
pound
but
petticoats
i
always
said
were
never
made
to
wear
in
bed
i
take
them
off
keep
on
my
gown
and
then
i
dare
defy
the
town
to
charge
me
with
immodesty
while
i
so
ever
cautious
be
the
spark
was
pleased
with
his
maid
of
apprehension
quick
he
said
her
witty
scheme
was
keen
he
swore
lying
in
gown
open
before
another
maid
when
in
the
dark
going
to
bed
with
her
dear
spark
she
tell
him
that
is
rather
shocking
to
bundle
in
with
shoes
and
stockings
nor
scrupling
but
she
quite
discreet
lying
with
naked
legs
and
feet
with
petticoat
so
thin
and
short
that
she
is
scarce
the
better
but
you
will
say
that
i
unfair
that
some
who
bundle
take
more
care
for
some
we
may
with
truth
suppose
bundle
in
bed
with
all
their
clothes
but
bundler
clothes
are
no
defence
unly
horses
push
the
fence
a
certain
fact
i
now
relate
that
true
indeed
without
debate
a
bundling
couple
went
to
bed
with
all
their
clothes
from
foot
to
head
that
the
defence
might
seem
complete
each
one
was
wrapped
in
a
sheet
but
o
this
bundling
such
a
witch
the
man
of
her
did
catch
the
itch
and
so
provoked
was
the
wretch
that
she
of
him
a
bastard
catch
ye
bundle
misses
do
you
blush
you
hang
your
heads
and
bid
me
hush
if
you
wont
tell
me
how
you
feel
i
ask
your
sparks
they
best
can
tell
but
it
is
custom
you
will
say
and
custom
always
bears
the
sway
if
i
wont
take
my
sparks
to
bed
a
laughing
stock
i
shall
be
made
a
vulgar
custom
is
i
own
admir
by
many
a
slut
and
clown
but
is
a
method
of
proceeding
as
much
abhorr
by
those
of
breeding
you
welcome
to
the
lines
i
penn
for
they
were
written
by
a
friend
who
think
himself
quite
well
rewarded
if
this
vile
practice
is
discarded
the
party
in
favor
of
bundling
were
able
too
to
a
as
is
shown
by
the
following
ballad
which
we
transcribe
from
a
printed
copy
preserved
by
the
american
antiquarian
society
a
new
song
in
favour
of
courting
adam
at
first
was
form
of
dust
as
scripture
doth
record
and
did
receive
a
wife
call
eve
from
his
creator
lord
from
adam
side
a
crooked
bride
the
lord
was
pleas
to
form
ordain
that
they
in
bed
might
lay
to
keep
each
other
warm
to
court
indeed
they
had
no
need
she
was
his
wife
at
first
and
she
was
made
to
be
his
aid
whose
origin
was
dust
this
new
made
pair
full
happy
were
and
happy
might
remain
if
his
help
mate
had
never
ate
the
fruit
that
was
restrain
tho
adam
wife
destroy
his
life
in
manner
that
was
awful
yet
marriage
now
we
all
allow
to
be
both
just
and
lawful
but
women
must
be
courted
first
because
it
is
the
fashion
and
so
at
times
commit
great
crimes
caus
by
a
lustful
passion
and
now
a
days
there
are
two
ways
which
of
the
two
is
right
to
lie
between
sheets
sweet
and
clean
or
sit
up
all
the
night
but
some
suppose
bundling
in
clothes
do
heaven
sorely
vex
then
let
me
know
which
way
to
go
to
court
the
female
sex
whether
they
must
be
hugg
or
when
sitting
by
the
fire
or
whether
they
in
bed
may
lay
which
doth
the
lord
require
but
some
pretend
to
recommend
the
sitting
up
all
night
courting
in
chairs
as
doth
appear
to
them
to
be
most
right
nature
request
is
grant
me
rest
our
bodies
seek
repose
night
is
the
time
and
is
no
crime
to
bundle
in
your
clothes
since
in
a
bed
a
man
and
maid
may
bundle
and
be
chaste
it
does
no
good
to
burn
out
wood
it
is
a
needless
waste
let
coats
and
gowns
be
laid
aside
and
breeches
take
their
flight
an
honest
man
and
woman
can
lay
quiet
all
the
night
in
genesis
no
knowledge
is
of
this
thing
to
be
got
whether
young
men
did
bundle
then
or
whether
they
did
not
the
sacred
book
says
wives
they
took
it
do
say
how
they
courted
whether
that
they
in
bed
did
lay
or
by
the
fire
sported
but
some
do
hold
in
times
of
old
that
those
about
to
wed
spent
not
the
night
nor
yet
the
light
by
fire
or
in
the
bed
they
only
meant
to
say
they
sent
a
man
to
chuse
a
bride
isaac
did
so
but
let
me
know
of
any
one
beside
man
do
pretend
to
trust
a
friend
to
choose
him
sheep
and
cows
much
less
a
wife
which
all
his
life
he
doth
expect
to
house
since
it
doth
stand
each
man
in
hand
to
happify
his
life
i
would
advise
each
to
be
wise
and
chuse
a
prudent
wife
since
bundling
is
not
the
thing
that
judgments
will
procure
go
on
young
men
and
bundle
then
but
keep
your
bodies
pure

the
foregoing
version
is
evidently
not
complete
several
verses
having
been
left
out
on
account
of
their
containing
truth
than
but
these
may
be
supplied
from
a
manuscript
copy
evidently
made
from
memory
with
considerable
variations
from
the

copy
which
by
no
means
improve
it
though
the
schoolmaster
did
his
best
and
probably
saved
for
us
a
very
complete
version
of
the
ballad
as
it
passed
from
mouth
to
mouth
before
the
printed
copy
was
made
it
was
transcribed
from
a
volume
of
manuscript
ballads
in
the

of
israel
perkins
of
connecticut
written
in
when
he
was
eighteen
years
old
and
teaching
school
the
whore
on
the
snow
crust
adam
at
first
was
formed
of
dust
as
we
find
on
record
and
did
receive
a
wife
cal
eve
by
a
creative
word
from
adam
side
a
crooked
bride
we
find
complete
in
form
ordained
that
they
in

might
lay
and
keep
each
other
warm
to
court
indeed
they
had
no
need
she
was
his

at

and
she
was
made

whose

tho

destroyed
his

in

that

now
we
all
allow
to

and
now
a

to

the
fairer

whether

when

or
whether

doth

an

can
lie

but
if
there

breeches
nor

the
rage
of

tho

did

be

a

bastards
are
not
at
all

got
in

beds
we
know
the
strumpet
oath
convinces
both
oft
times
it
is
not
so
one
whorish
dame
i
fear
to
name
lest
i
should
give
offence
but
in
this
town
she
was
took
down
not
more
than
eight
months
sence
she
was
the
first
that
on
snow
crust
i
ever
knew
to

i
hint
no
more
about
this
whore
for
fear
i
should
offend
her
was
on
the
snow
when
sol
was
low
and
was
in
capricorn
a
child
was
got
and
it
will
not
be
long
ere
it
is
born
now
unto
those
that
do
oppose
the
bundling
traid
i
say
perhaps
there
more
got
on
the
floor
than
any
other
way
in
ancient
books
no
knowledge
is
of
these
things
to
be
got
whether
young
men
did
bundle
then
or
whether
they
did
not
sence
ancient
book
says
wife
they
took
it
dont
say
how
they
courted
whether
young
men
did
bundle
then
or
by
the

sported
but
some
do
hold
in

let
me
know
if
any

beside

do
pretend
to
trust
a

to
choose

sheep
or

much
more
a

all
his

sence
bundling
is
not
a

that
judgment
will
procure
go
on
young
men
and
bundle
then
but
keep
your
bodies
pure
since
this
work
went
to
press
we
have
been
favored
by
one
of
our
antiquarian
friends
in
massachusetts
with
a
copy
of
another
poetical
blast
against
the
practice
of
bundling
it
was
written
in
the
latter
part
of
the
last
or
the
first
decade
of
the
present
century
by
a
learned
and
distinguished
clergyman
settled
in
bristol
county
massachusetts
who
was
a
graduate
of
harvard
university
and
a
doctor
of
divinity
the
original
manuscript
from
which
our
copy
is
made
is
very
carefully
written
out
with
corrections
apparently
of
a
later
date
and
now
undoubtedly
appears
for
the
first
time
in
printed
form
a
poem
against
to
ye
youth
of
both
hail
giddy
youth
inclined
to
mirth
to
guilty
amours
prone
come
blush
with
me
to
think
and
see
how
shameless
you
are
grown
is
not
amiss
to
court
and
kiss
nor
friendship
do
we
blame
but
bundling
in
women
with
men
upon
the
bed
of
shame
and
there
to
lay
till
break
of
day
and
think
it
is
no
sin
because
a
smock
and
petticoat
have
chance
to
lie
between
such
rank
disgrace
and
scandal
base
all
modest
youth
will
shun
for
infest
like
plague
or
pest
and
you
will
be
undone
let
boars
and
swine
lie
down
and
twine
and
grunt
and
sleep
and
snore
but
modest
girls
should
not
wear
tails
nor
bristles
any
more
let
rams
the
sheep
mount
up
and
leap
without
restraint
or
blame
but
will
young
men
act
just
like
them
oh
is
a
burning
shame
it
is
not
strange
that
horses
range
unfettered
to
the
last
but
youthful
lusts
in
fetters
must
be
chained
to
virtue
fast
dogs
and
bitches
wear
no
breeches
clothing
for
man
was
made
yet
men
and
women
strip
to
their
linen
and
tumble
into
bed
yes
brutal
youth
it
is
the
truth
your
modesty
is
gone
and
could
you
blush
you
think
as
much
and
curse
what
you
have
done
to
have
done
so
some
years
ago
was
counted
more
disgrace
than
is
of
late
to
propagate
a
spurious
bastard
race
quit
human
kind
and
herd
with
swine
confess
yourself
an
whore
go
fill
the
stye
there
live
and
die
or
never
bundle
more
shall
gentlemen
with
ladies
join
to
practice
like
the
brutes
then
let
them
keep
with
cattle
and
sheep
and
fodder
on
their
fruits
this
cursed
course
is
one
great
source
of
matches
undesigned
quarrels
and
strife
twixt
man
and
wife
and
bastards
of
their
kind
but
in
excuse
of
this
abuse
it
oftentimes
is
said
father
and
mother
did
no
other
than
strip
and
go
to
bed
but
grant
some
did
as
you
have
said
yet
do
they
not
repent
and
wish
that
you
may
never
do
what
they
so
much
lament
a
stupid
ass
ca
be
more
base
than
are
those
guilty
youth
who
fill
with
smart
a
parent
heart
and
turn
it
into
mirth
others
do
plead
hard
for
the
bed
their
health
and
weariness
so
drunkards
will
drink
down
their
swill
and
call
it
no
excess
under
pretense
of
self
defense
others
will
scold
and
say
an
honest
maid
is
chaste
abed
as
any
other
way
but
where
the
man
that
fire
can
into
his
bosom
take
or
go
through
coals
on
his
foot
soles
and
not
a
blister
make
temptation
way
has
led
astray
the
likeliest
of
you
all
and
yet
found
on
slippery
ground
and
think
you
can
not
fall
a
female
meek
with
blushing
cheek
seized
in
some
lover
arms
has
oft
grown
weak
with
cupid
heat
and
lost
her
virgin
charms
but
last
of
all
up
speaks
romp
moll
and
pleads
to
be
excused
for
how
can
she
married
be
if
bundling
be
refused
what
strange
mistake
young
women
to
hope
for
sparks
this
way
your
fond
bold
acts
ca
lay
a
tax
that
men
will
ever
pay
so
cheap
and
free
some
women
be
that
men
are
cloyed
with
sweet
as
horse
or
cow
starve
at
the
mow
with
fodder
under
feet
is
therefore
vain
yourselves
to
screen
the
practice
is
accurst
it
is
condemned
by
god
and
man
the
pious
and
the
just
should
you
go
on
the
day
will
come
when
christ
your
judge
will
say
in
bind
each
of
this
kind
and
cast
them
all
away
down
deep
in
hell
there
let
them
dwell
and
bundle
on
that
bed
there
burn
and
roll
without
control
all
their
lusts
are
fed
the
evidence
presented
in
the
preceding
pages
establishes
as
we
think
the
following
facts
that
the
custom
so
far
as
it
pertained
to
the
american
states
had
its
origin
as
a
matter
of
convenience
and
necessity
that
in
all
stages
of
its
history
it
was
chiefly
confined
to
the
humbler
classes
of
society
that
its
prevalence
may
be
said
to
have
closed
with
the
eighteenth
century
it
is
our
opinion
that
it
came
nearest
to
being
a
universal
custom
from
to
and
that
it
was
at
all
times
regarded
by
the
better
classes
as
a
serious
evil
and
was
no
more
countenanced
by
them
then
the
frequenting
of
grog
shops
is
by
the
better
class
of
the
present
day
this
opinion
is
corroborated
by
the
remarks
of
several
old
persons
whom
we
have
consulted
as
to
their
recollections
of
the
custom
among
these
of
east
haddam
now
in
his
year
says
that
he
well
remembers
it
that
it
could
not
be
called
general
though
frequent
it
was
not
practiced
among
the
more
intelligent
educated
classes
nor
among
those
who
lived
in
large
well
warmed
houses
he
says
it
was
not
the
fashion
to
bundle
with
any
chap
who
might
call
on
a
girl
but
that
it
was
a
special
favor
granted
only
to
a
favorite
lover
who
might
consider
it
a
proof
of
the
high
regard
which
the
damsel
had
for
him
in
short
it
was
accepted
who
were
thus
admitted
to
the
bed
of
the
fair
one
and
as
he
expresses
it
only
after
long
continued
urging
in
most
cases
he
thinks
the
fashion
ceased
about
to
and
in
consequence
of
education
and
refinement
and
that
more
mischief
was
done
then
than
there
is
in
the
same
strain
also
spoke
the
genial
colonel
a
native
of
berlin
born
in
he
was
perfectly
conversant
with
the
custom
had
known
the
old
ladies
in
some
cases
to
go
up
stairs
before
retiring
to
see
that
the
bundling
couple
were
comfortable
and
put
on
more
bedclothes
and
stoutly
asseverated
his
belief
that
there
was
any
more
mischief
done
in
those
days
than
there
is
now
indeed
all
the
old
people
with
whom
we
have
conversed
on
the
matter
although
in
some
cases
a
little
unwilling
to
own
that
they
had
ever
practiced
it
themselves
were
unanimous
in
their
belief
that
the
abuse
of
chastity
under
the
bundling
regime
was
no
more
frequent
than
it
is
now
one
old
gentleman
of
whom
we
have
heard
in
reply
to
the
half
reproachful
half
joking
question
of
his
grandson
whether
he
ashamed
replied
why
no
what
is
the
use
of
sitting
up
all
night
and
burning
out
fire
and
lights
when
you
could
just
as
well
get
under
kiver
and
keep
warm
and
when
you
get
tired
take
a
nap
and
wake
up
fresh
and
go
at
it
again
why
d
n
it
there
was
half
as
many
bastards
then
as
there
are
now
even
within
the
present
century
we
have
found
traces
of
the
continuance
of
the
practice
of
bundling
though
the
instances
are
perhaps
few
and
in
some
measure
exceptional
until
a
very
late
day
the
custom
as
a
matter
of
convenience
was
prevalent
among
the
dutch
settlers
of
pennsylvania
and
it
is
not
improbable
that
traces
may
still
continue
to
exist
in
some
of
the
more
remote
counties
of
that
state
an
old
schoolmaster
who
flourished
in
glastenbury
some
twenty
years
ago
when
relating
his
experiences
in
teaching
in
southern
pennsylvania
and
speaking
of
informed
us
that
when
for
any
reason
he
did
not
choose
to
go
to
his
boarding
place
for
the
time
being
he
was
accustomed
to
stop
at
a
tavern
kept
by
an
honest
old
dutchman
on
one
occasion
having
asked
the
landlord
if
he
could
stay
over
night
he
was
told
that
he
could
and
after
chatting
with
his
host
through
the
evening
was
shown
to
bed
the
landlord
set
down
the
candle
and
had
gone
out
of
the
room
when
our
friend
noticed
the
only
bed
in
the
room
was
already
occupied
and
calling
to
the
host
notified
him
of
the
fact
when
he
cried
back
oh
dat
ish
only
mine
taughter
she
wo
hurt
nopoty
and
coolly
went
his
way
and
our
friend
affirmed
that
he
found
the
daughter
not
only
harmless
but
also
quite
competent
to
take
care
of
herself
in
new
england
we
believe
that
cape
cod
has
the
dubious
honor
of
holding
out
the
longest
against
the
advance
of
civilization
bundling
as
we
have
it
on
good
authority
having
been
practiced
there
as
late
as
in
greenwich
new
jersey
it
was
in
vogue
in
in
the
state
of
new
york
this
custom
came
under
judicial
cognizance
in
the
year
when
the
supreme
court
held
that
although
bundling
was
admitted
to
be
the
custom
in
some
parts
of
the
state
it
being
proven
that
the
parents
of
the
girl
for
whose
seduction
the
suit
was
brought
countenanced
her
practicing
it
they
had
no
right
to
complain
or
ask
satisfaction
for
the
consequences
which
the
court
say
followed
appendix
bundling
from
of
august
published
at
portland
maine
and
edited
by
john
neal
by
rochefoucault
in
accounting
for
the
populousness
of
massachusetts
the
new
englanders
are
charged
with
bundling
by
chastelleux
whose
book
i
am
not
able
to
refer
to
now
the
charge
is
repeated
and
by
half
a
score
of
other
honest
good
natured
people
who
have
made
books
about
the
new
world
but
if
you
enquire
into
the
business
you
are
pretty
sure
to
be
told
inquire
where
you
may
that
bundling
is
not
known
but
somewhere
further
back
in
the
woods
or
further
nay
while
in
every
part
of
the
united
states
the
multitude
speak
of
bundling
as
the
habit
of
their
neighbors
either
east
west
north
or
south
where
the
witches
of
the
country
were
about
a
century
ago
by
the
grandfathers
of
this
generation
i
myself
though
i
have
taken
trouble
enough
to
learn
the
truth
have
never
yet
been
able
to
meet
with
a
case
of
bundling
of
bundling
proper
i
should
say
in
the
united
states
nor
with
but
one
trustworthy
individual
who
had
ever
met
with
so
much
as
one
case
and
he
had
met
with
one
for
which
he
would
give
his
word
these
things
are
trifles
but
when
they
are
told
in
books
that
are
read
and
trusted
to
throughout
europe
such
books
too
as
that
of
the
marquis
de
chastelleux
or
that
of
de
rouchefoucault
it
becomes
a
matter
of
serious
inquiry
the
truth
must
be
told
whatever
it
is
for
the
truth
can
not
be
so
bad
whatever
it
may
be
as
the
untruth
which
is
now
repeated
of
us
the
travels
of
chastelleux
are
translated
by
an
englishman
who
had
been
a
long
while
in
this
country
the
book
was
undoubtedly
written
with
great
care
by
a
very
honest
able
man
who
had
very
good
opportunities
of
knowing
the
truth
and
is
now
set
off
by
another
very
honest
able
man
who
was
if
anything
rather
partial
to
america
enough
to
make
one
wary
of
trusting
the
report
of
any
traveler
who
does
not
say
in
so
many
words
after
establishing
a
character
for
himself
i
saw
this
i
heard
this
i
take
nobody
word
for
what
i
now
say
etc
it
would
be
easy
to
enumerate
a
multitude
of
other
stories
which
are
now
believed
in
about
the
people
of
the
united
states
not
only
by
the
people
of
europe
and
of
great
britain
particularly
but
by
the
people
of
the
united
states
themselves
but
a
dry
catalogue
of
such
things
would
be
of
little
use
here
he
refers
to
the
charge
reported
of
new
englanders
that
that
they
pork
and
molasses
pork
and
together
which
is
here
denied
as
a
ridiculous
story
they
bundle
in
wales
bundling
there
is
a
serious
matter
a
lady
a
welsh
woman
whose
word
is
truth
itself
assured
me
not
long
ago
that
in
her
country
they
do
not
think
a
bit
the
worse
of
a
girl
for
anticipating
her
duties
in
other
words
for
being
a
mother
before
she
has
been
a
wife
they
have
discovered
perhaps
that
cause
and
effect
may
be
convertible
terms
that
in
such
a
serious
matter
none
but
a
fool
would
buy
a
pig
in
the
poke
and
that
after
all
maternity
may
lead
to
marriage
there
as
marriage
leads
to
maternity
here
and
why
not
for
after
the
establishment
of
the
hospitals
of
russia
the
unmarried
who
bore
to
the
were
proud
of
the
duty
and
were
looked
upon
we
are
told
with
great
favor
by
the
public
she
added
also
that
she
was
once
at
a
party
made
up
of
sixteen
or
eighteen
females
and
females
of
good
characters
all
but
one
or
two
of
whom
were
mothers
or
had
been
so
before
they
were
married
by
chastelleux
and
his
english
translator
it
would
appear
to
have
been
very
much
the
same
in
america
about
the
years
it
is
not
so
now
to
have
had
a
child
before
marriage
would
now
be
fatal
to
a
woman
here
whatever
might
be
her
condition
or
beauty
fatal
in
every
shape
no
man
would
have
courage
to
marry
her
no
woman
of
character
would
associate
with
her
ask
the
first
individual
you
meet
above
the
age
of
twelve
or
thirteen
here
and
you
may
have
the
name
and
history
of
every
poor
girl
in
the
neighborhood
who
has
been
so
unlucky
as
to
have
a
child
of
her
own
without
leave
perhaps
within
a
period
of
six
or
eight
years
in
a
populous
neighborhood
of
twenty
or
thirty
miles
about
a
widow
with
half
a
score
of
children
forty
years
ago
if
we
may
believe
franklin
was
an
object
for
the
fortune
hunters
of
america
it
is
not
so
now
the
demand
for
widows
and
for
every
sort
of
ready
made
family
is
beginning
to
be
over
that
which
is
called
bundling
here
though
bad
enough
is
not
a
twentieth
part
so
bad
here
it
is
only
a
mode
of
courtship
the
parties
instead
of
sitting
up
together
go
to
bed
together
but
go
to
bed
with
their
clothes
on
this
would
appear
to
be
a
perilous
fashion
but
i
have
been
assured
by
the
individual
above
that
he
had
proof
to
the
contrary
for
in
the
particular
case
alluded
to
the
only
case
i
ever
heard
of
on
good
authority
although
he
was
invited
by
the
parents
of
a
pretty
girl
who
stood
near
him
to
bundle
with
her
and
although
he
bundle
with
her
he
had
every
reason
to
believe
that
if
he
had
been
very
free
or
more
free
than
he
might
have
been
at
a
country
frolick
after
they
had
invited
him
to
escort
her
to
sit
up
with
her
to
dance
with
her
he
would
have
been
treated
as
a
traitor
by
all
parties
he
had
a
fair
opportunity
of
knowing
the
truth
and
he
spoke
of
the
matter
as
if
he
would
prefer
the
etiquette
of
sitting
up
to
the
etiquette
of
going
to
bed
with
a
girl
who
had
been
so
brought
up
he
complained
of
her
as
a
prude
the
following
communication
appears
however
to
be
one
that
may
be
depended
on
neal
if
you
wish
to
know
the
truth
about
bundling
i
think
your
correspondent
could
tell
you
all
about
it
it
seems
by
his
confession
that
he
has
practiced
it
on
a
large
scale
i
never
heard
of
the
thing
till
about
three
years
ago
an
acquaintance
of
mine
had
gone
to
spend
the
summer
with
an
aunt
who
lived
somewhere
near
sandy
river
the
following
is
a
copy
of
one
of
her
letters
while
there
should
have
written
sooner
so
do
think
me
unkind
for
i
have
been
waiting
for
something
to
write
about
you
requested
me
to
give
you
a
faithful
description
of
the
country
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
inhabitants
etc
i
have
not
been
here
quite
three
months
but
i
have
been
everywhere
seen
everything
and
got
acquainted
with
everybody
i
shall
certainly
inform
you
of
everything
i
have
seen
or
heard
that
is
worth
relating
remember
how
you
told
me
before
i
left
home
that
i
was
so
well
looking
that
if
i
went
so
far
back
in
the
country
i
should
be
very
much
admired
and
flattered
and
have
as
many
lovers
as
i
could
wish
for
i
find
it
all
true
the
people
here
are
remarkably
kind
and
attentive
to
me
they
seem
to
think
that
i
must
be
something
more
than
common
because
i
have
always
lived
so
near
portland
i
must
tell
you
that
since
i
have
been
here
i
have
had
a
beau
you
must
know
that
the
young
men
are
very
attentive
to
me
well
among
these
is
who
is
considered
the
finest
young
man
in
the
place
and
well
he
may
be
he
owns
a
good
farm
which
has
a
large
barn
upon
it
and
a
neat
two
story
house
all
finished
these
are
the
fruits
of
his
own
industry
besides
he
is
remarkably
good
looking
is
very
large
but
and
has
a
good
share
of
what
i
call
real
manly
beauty
soon
after
my
arrival
here
i
was
introduced
to
this
man
no
not
neither
for
they
never
think
of
such
a
thing
here
they
all
know
me
of
course
because
i
am
a
some
days
three
four
or
half
a
dozen
call
to
see
me
whom
i
never
before
saw
or
heard
of
they
come
and
speak
to
me
as
if
i
were
an
old
acquaintance
and
i
converse
with
them
as
freely
as
if
i
had
always
known
them
from
childhood
in
this
kind
of
a
way
i
got
acquainted
with
my
beau
that
he
was
very
attentive
to
me
from
our
first
meeting
if
we
happened
to
be
going
anywhere
in
company
he
was
sure
to
offer
me
his
arm
no
i
am
wrong
again
he
never
offered
me
his
arm
in
his
life
if
you
go
to
walk
with
a
young
man
here
instead
of
offering
you
his
arm
as
the
young
men
do
up
our
way
he
either
takes
your
hand
in
his
or
passes
one
arm
around
your
waist
and
this
he
does
with
such
a
provoking
careless
honesty
that
you
can
not
for
your
life
be
offended
with
him
well
i
had
walked
with
my
jonathan
several
times
in
this
kind
of
style
i
confess
there
was
something
in
him
i
could
not
but
like
he
does
not
lack
for
wit
and
has
a
good
share
of
common
sense
his
language
is
never
studied
he
always
seems
to
speak
from
the
heart
so
when
he
asked
what
sort
of
a
companion
he
would
make
i
very
candidly
answered
that
i
thought
he
would
make
a
very
agreeable
one
i
think
just
so
of
you
said
he
and
it
shall
not
be
my
fault
he
continued
if
we
are
not
companions
for
life
we
shall
surely
make
a
bargain
said
he
after
sitting
silent
a
few
moments
so
we
what
i
asked
will
bundle
together
said
he
you
surely
know
what
i
mean
i
know
that
our
farmers
bundle
and
do
you
mean
that
you
want
me
to
help
you
bundle
any
of
these
inquired
i
i
mean
that
i
want
you
to
stay
with
me
it
is
the
custom
in
this
place
when
a
man
stays
with
a
girl
if
it
is
warm
weather
for
them
to
throw
themselves
on
the
bed
outside
the
bed
clothes
if
the
weather
is
cold
they
crawl
under
the
clothes
then
if
they
have
anything
to
they
say
it
when
they
get
tired
of
talking
they
go
to
sleep
this
is
what
we
call
bundling
now
what
do
you
call
it
in
your
part
of
the
world
we
have
no
such
works
answered
i
not
amongst
respectable
people
nor
do
i
think
that
any
people
would
that
either
thought
themselves
respectable
or
wished
to
be
thought
so
be
too
severe
upon
us
miss
i
have
always
observed
that
those
who
so
much
modesty
have
in
reality
but
little
i
always
act
as
i
feel
and
speak
as
i
think
i
wish
you
to
do
the
same
but
have
none
of
your
with
me
you
smile
you
begin
to
think
you
have
been
a
little
too
scrupulous
you
have
no
objection
to
bundling
have
you
indeed
i
have
i
am
not
to
be
trifled
with
so
if
you
refuse
i
have
done
with
you
forever
then
be
done
as
quick
as
you
please
for
i
not
bundle
with
you
nor
with
any
other
man
then
farewell
proud
girl
said
he
farewell
honest
man
said
i
and
off
he
went
sure
enough
have
since
made
inquiries
about
and
find
that
it
is
the
custom
here
and
that
they
think
no
more
harm
of
it
than
we
do
our
way
of
a
young
couple
sitting
up
together
i
have
known
an
instance
since
i
have
been
here
of
a
girl
taking
her
sweetheart
to
a
neighbor
house
and
asking
for
a
bed
or
two
to
lodge
in
or
rather
to
in
they
had
company
at
her
father
so
that
their
beds
were
occupied
she
thought
no
harm
of
it
she
and
her
family
are
respectable
says
bundling
was
a
very
common
thing
in
our
part
of
the
country
in
old
times
that
most
of
the
first
settlers
lived
in
log
houses
which
seldom
had
more
than
one
room
with
a
fire
place
in
this
room
the
old
people
slept
so
if
one
of
their
girls
had
a
sweetheart
in
the
winter
she
must
either
sit
with
him
in
the
room
where
her
father
and
mother
slept
or
take
him
into
her
sleeping
room
she
would
choose
the
latter
for
the
sake
of
being
alone
with
him
but
sometimes
when
the
cold
was
very
severe
rather
than
freeze
to
death
they
would
crawl
under
the
and
this
after
a
while
became
a
habit
a
custom
or
a
fashion
the
man
that
i
am
going
to
send
this
by
is
just
ready
to
start
so
i
can
not
stop
to
write
more
now
in
my
next
i
give
you
a
more
particular
account
of
the
people
here
adieu
you
may
be
sure
that
what
is
related
in
the
foregoing
letter
is
the
truth
i
know
that
there
is
considerable
information
in
it
mixed
up
with
about
which
you
wished
to
be
informed
but
i
could
not
very
well
separate
it
so
after
all
that
has
been
said
of
the
practice
of
bundling
in
our
country
by
foreign
writers
travelers
and
reviewers
after
all
the
reproach
that
has
been
heaped
upon
us
now
that
we
are
able
to
get
at
the
plain
truth
it
appears
to
be
though
certainly
a
bad
practice
not
half
so
bad
as
the
junketing
and
sitting
up
courtships
that
are
known
elsewhere
nay
more
though
in
the
present
state
of
society
it
is
a
practice
that
should
be
utterly
discountenanced
everywhere
still
it
would
seem
to
have
grown
up
out
of
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
our
first
settlers
to
be
confined
to
remote
and
small
districts
for
i
have
heard
of
only
three
instances
after
all
my
inquiry
and
to
be
rapidly
going
out
of
practice
yet
more
there
can
be
no
bad
intentions
there
can
be
no
evil
consequences
where
respectable
and
modest
women
are
not
ashamed
to
acknowledge
that
they
bundle
i
am
anxious
to
know
the
truth
for
the
purpose
of
correcting
both
the
that
are
abroad
and
the
that
prevail
here
bundling
however
is
known
in
other
countries
where
they
have
less
excuse
and
in
wales
where
they
do
bundle
as
i
have
said
before
it
is
no
reproach
for
a
woman
to
have
had
a
child
before
marriage
it
was
so
in
russia
after
catharine
established
her
hospitals
in
the
next
number
of
august
there
is
the
following
editorial
paragraph
bundling
there
is
a
great
outcry
just
now
about
the
paper
on
bundling
which
was
in
the
last
now
this
very
outcry
proves
the
want
of
the
very
paper
alluded
to
the
article
is
about
bundling
and
people
who
imagine
bundling
to
be
what
it
is
not
a
highly
improper
and
unchaste
familiarity
are
offended
with
it
but
the
very
purpose
of
that
paper
is
to
show
that
bundling
is
not
what
it
is
believed
to
be
that
it
is
neither
so
common
nor
so
bad
not
a
fiftieth
part
so
bad
as
people
have
imagined
appendix
ii
that
the
customs
of
courtship
in
many
parts
of
the
united
kingdom
at
the
present
day
are
precisely
what
they
were
in
some
parts
of
new
england
new
jersey
and
pennsylvania
fifty
years
ago
is
evident
from
the
revelations
of
the
commission
on
the
marriage
in
the
year
strahan
a
physician
and
surgeon
who
for
nearly
forty
years
has
practiced
in
the
scottish
county
of
stirling
testifies
before
the
commission
that
his
attention
was
first
drawn
to
the
subject
in
consequence
of
observing
the
very
great
extent
of
immorality
among
the
working
classes
not
only
as
evidenced
by
the
large
number
of
illegitimate
children
but
also
by
the
still
larger
number
of
marriages
after
the
woman
was
with
child
and
the
number
of
children
born
within
eight
months
of
wedlock
he
found
to
his
astonishment
that
among
the
working
classes
the
agricultural
laborers
nine
out
of
ten
women
when
married
either
had
had
illegitimate
children
or
were
pregnant
at
the
time
of
marriage
i
have
he
says
a
large
midwifery
practice
and
i
very
rarely
attend
a
woman
with
her
first
child
where
the
child
is
not
born
within
a
few
months
of
wedlock
or
else
she
has
had
an
illegitimate
child
before
he
believes
it
is
very
common
for
women
to
allow
themselves
to
be
seduced
in
the
hope
of
being
married
they
go
on
until
they
are
and
then
if
the
young
man
is
at
all
a
decent
fellow
the
friends
interfere
and
the
marriage
is
hurried
on
the
sketch
which
strahan
supplies
of
scotch
courtships
explains
all
this
part
of
his
observation
young
men
and
women
meet
together
at
night
and
the
ordinary
time
is
the
middle
of
the
night
when
every
one
else
is
in
bed
it
is
universal
says
strahan
to
the
commission
among
the
working
classes
to
have
this
manner
of
courtship
of
which
i
speak
there
is
no
other
courtship
in
any
other
form
the
fathers
and
mothers
will
not
allow
their
daughters
to
meet
a
young
man
in
the
the
young
man
never
visits
the
family
but
the
parents
quite
allow
this
they
have
done
it
themselves
before
and
there
is
no
objection
to
it
the
young
man
comes
makes
a
noise
at
the
window
the
young
woman
goes
out
they
go
to
some
outhouse
or
perhaps
the
young
man
is
admitted
to
the
young
woman
bedroom
after
all
are
in
bed
and
there
is
an
hour
or
two
of
what
is
called
courtship
but
which
would
more
properly
be
called
flirtation
because
it
is
not
necessary
that
there
should
be
any
engagement
to
marry
in
these
cases
lord
lyveden
inquired
do
these
meetings
take
place
at
particular
periods
such
as
harvest
time
or
is
it
over
the
whole
of
the
year
the
whole
of
the
year
very
commonly
the
young
man
visits
the
young
woman
once
a
week
lord
chelmsford
said
in
england
that
would
be
called
it
is
a
very
extraordinary
way
of
keeping
company
when
the
parents
allow
their
daughter
to
go
out
with
the
young
man
at
midnight
or
the
young
man
to
come
into
her
bedroom
yes
the
parents
know
no
other
way
of
doing
it
i
have
reasoned
with
the
parents
often
when
attending
a
case
of
illegitimate
birth
pointing
out
to
the
parents
how
it
is
they
have
been
led
on
but
they
can
not
imagine
any
other
way
of
doing
it
their
daughters
must
have
husbands
and
there
is
no
other
way
of
courting
justice
asking
does
it
prevail
generally
in
scotland
was
answered
universally
among
the
agricultural
laborers
in
reply
to
an
inquiry
by
dunlop
whether
these
young
men
lived
under
any
kind
of
supervision
and
knowledge
of
their
masters
or
whether
they
could
go
out
and
in
as
they
pleased
strahan
stated
that
plowmen
for
instance
very
often
live
in
or
in
the
farm
house
they
get
out
after
all
are
in
bed
out
of
the
window
or
if
they
live
in
a
bothie
without
any
trouble
they
go
to
the
neighboring
they
knock
at
the
window
the
girl
comes
to
the
window
and
if
she
know
the
young
man
or
after
a
little
parley
if
she
does
not
know
him
she
either
comes
out
and
goes
with
him
to
an
outhouse
or
he
comes
into
her
bedroom
you
must
remember
that
they
have
no
other
means
of
intercourse
that
is
the
point
you
press
so
much
yes
a
young
woman
can
not
see
either
a
sweetheart
or
an
acquaintance
in
any
other
way
i
believe
if
it
was
not
for
fear
of
being
out
at
night
the
girls
would
visit
one
another
in
the
same
way
they
have
no
other
means
of
visiting
the
customs
of
the
country
are
such
that
a
young
man
could
not
be
seen
going
in
to
visit
his
sweetheart
justice
if
the
father
knew
that
the
young
man
was
coming
into
the
house
and
knew
that
he
was
with
his
daughter
would
he
not
interfere
he
would
lie
comfortably
in
his
bed
knowing
that
his
daughter
was
in
an
or
barn
with
a
young
man
for
perhaps
two
hours
shutting
his
eyes
to
it
in
the
same
way
that
a
person
in
the
higher
ranks
would
shut
his
eyes
to
his
daughter
going
out
for
a
walk
with
a
young
man
strahan
said
also
when
you
come
to
the
middle
class
a
young
man
would
not
marry
a
girl
that
had
had
a
child
to
another
man
and
very
probably
he
would
not
marry
a
girl
that
had
had
a
child
to
himself
but
in
the
lower
classes
it
is
not
so
it
is
almost
universal
to
marry
a
woman
that
has
had
a
child
or
that
is
with
child
to
himself
but
it
is
very
frequent
to
marry
a
woman
that
has
had
a
child
to
another
man
the
only
objection
is
the
burden
of
the
child
the
burden
of
the
child
might
be
an
obstacle
but
the
disgrace
would
be
none
is
it
supposed
asked
a
commissioner
that
the
woman
by
marrying
this
other
man
wipes
off
her
disgrace
with
the
former
yes
but
it
is
so
common
that
the
disgrace
is
not
so
much
as
to
prevent
the
young
man
marrying
her
the
it
is
hardly
within
our
inquiry
but
still
it
is
interesting
to
know
can
you
tell
me
whether
in
these
cases
where
the
woman
marries
a
man
who
is
not
the
father
of
her
child
any
confusion
as
to
the
parent
of
the
previously
born
child
arises
are
they
apt
in
law
to
pass
as
the
children
of
the
subsequent
husband
no
i
do
not
think
so
the
distinction
is
always
kept
up
the
distinction
is
always
kept
up
very
often
the
illegitimate
child
goes
by
his
own
father
name
even
among
the
other
children
and
i
do
not
think
there
is
apt
to
be
any
confusion
of
that
kind
still
it
seems
that
in
severely
calvinistic
scotia
the
church
does
not
wholly
wink
at
this
state
of
things
the
sinning
couple
after
marriage
have
to
go
through
a
certain
whitewashing
at
church
before
they
are
admitted
to
what
are
called
church
privileges
they
have
to
go
before
a
kirk
session
consisting
of
the
minister
and
perhaps
half
a
dozen
elders
when
they
are
if
the
parties
are
married
they
appear
but
once
if
not
married
generally
three
times
they
tender
themselves
for
rebuke
without
invitation
as
without
it
the
child
can
not
be
baptized
or
admission
given
to
the
sacrament
they
apply
to
the
minister
in
private
and
confess
their
fault
and

them
to
be

iv
the
law
of

observed
in
the
highlands
has
frequently
been
as
little
understood
as
that
of
succession
and
similar
misconceptions
have
prevailed
regarding
it
this
was
perhaps
to
be
expected
in
a
country
where
a
bastard
son
was
often
found
in
undisturbed
possession
of
the
chiefship
or
property
of
a
clan
and
where
such
bastard
generally
received
the
support
of
the
clansmen
against
the
claims
of
the
feudal
heir
it
was
natural
to
suppose
that
very
loose
notions
of
succession
were
entertained
by
the
people
that
legitimacy
conferred
no
exclusive
rights
and
that
the
title
founded
on
birth
alone
might
be
set
aside
in
favor
of
one
having
no
other
claim
than
that
of
election
but
this
although
a
plausible
would
nevertheless
be
an
erroneous
supposition
the
person
here
considered
as
a
bastard
and
described
as
such
was
by
no
means
viewed
in
the
same
light
by
the
highlanders
because
according
to
their
law
of
marriage
which
was
originally
very
different
from
the
feudal
system
in
this
matter
his
claim
to
legitimacy
was
as
undoubted
as
that
of
the
feudal
heir
afterward
became
it
is
well
known
that
the
notions
of
the
highlanders
were
peculiarly
strict
in
regard
to
matters
of
hereditary
succession
and
that
no
people
on
earth
was
less
likely
to
sanction
any
flagrant
deviation
from
what
they
believed
to
be
the
right
and
true
line
of
descent
all
their
peculiar
habits
feelings
and
prejudices
were
in
direct
opposition
to
a
practice
which
had
it
been
really
acted
upon
must
have
introduced
endless
disorder
and
confusion
and
hence
the
natural
explanation
of
this
apparent
anomaly
seems
to
be
what
skene
has
stated
namely
that
a
person
who
was
feudally
a
bastard
might
in
their
view
be
considered
as
legitimate
and
therefore
entitled
to
be
supported
in
accordance
with
their
strict
ideas
of
hereditary
right
and
their
habitual
tenacity
of
whatever
belonged
to
their
ancient
usages
nor
is
this
mere
conjecture
or
hypothesis
a
singular
custom
regarding
marriage
retained
till
a
late
period
amongst
the
highlanders
and
clearly
indicating
that
their
law
of
marriage
originally
differed
in
some
essential
points
from
that
established
under
the
feudal
system
seems
to
afford
a
simple
and
natural
explanation
of
the
difficulty
by
which
genealogists
have
been
so
much
puzzled
this
custom
was
termed
and
consisted
in
a
species
of
contract
between
two
chiefs
by
which
it
was
agreed
that
the
heir
of
one
should
live
with
the
daughter
of
the
other
as
her
husband
for
twelve
months
and
a
day
if
in
that
time
the
lady
became
a
mother
or
proved
to
be
with
child
the
marriage
became
good
in
law
even
although
no
priest
had
performed
the
marriage
ceremony
in
due
form
but
should
there
not
have
occurred
any
appearance
of
issue
the
contract
was
considered
at
an
end
and
each
party
was
at
liberty
to
marry
or
with
any
other
it
is
manifest
that
the
practice
of
so
peculiar
a
species
of
marriage
must
have
been
in
terms
of
original
law
among
the
highlanders
otherwise
it
would
be
difficult
to
conceive
how
such
a
custom
could
have
originated
and
it
is
in
fact
one
which
seems
naturally
to
have
arisen
from
the
form
of
their
society
which
rendered
it
a
matter
of
such
vital
importance
to
secure
the
lineal
succession
of
their
chiefs
it
is
perhaps
not
improbable
that
it
was
this
peculiar
custom
which
gave
rise
to
the
report
handed
down
by
the
roman
and
other
historians
that
the
ancient
inhabitants
of
great
britain
had
their
wives
in
common
or
that
it
was
the
foundation
of
that
law
of
scotland
by
which
natural
children
became
legitimatized
by
subsequent
marriage
and
as
this
custom
remained
in
the
highlands
until
a
very
late
period
the
sanction
of
ancient
custom
was
sufficient
to
induce
them
to
persist
in
regarding
the
offspring
of
such
marriages
as
legitimate
it
appears
indeed
that
as
late
as
the
sixteenth
century
the
issue
of
a
marriage
claimed
the
earldom
of
sutherland
the
claimant
according
to
sir
robert
gordon
described
himself
as
one
lawfully
descended
from
his
father
john
the
third
earl
because
as
he
alleged
his
mother
was
and
fianced
to
his
father
and
his
claim
was
bought
off
which
shows
that
it
was
not
considered
as
altogether
incapable
of
being
maintained
by
sir
adam
gordon
who
had
married
the
heiress
of
earl
john
such
then
was
the
nature
of
the
peculiar
and
temporary
connection
which
gave
rise
to
the
apparent
anomalies
which
we
have
been
considering
it
was
a
custom
which
had
for
its
object
not
to
interrupt
but
to
preserve
the
lineal
succession
of
the
chiefs
and
to
obviate
the
very
evil
of
which
it
is
conceived
to
afford
a
glaring
example
but
after
the
introduction
of
the
feudal
law
which
in
this
respect
was
directly
opposed
to
the
ancient
highland
law
the
lineal
and
legitimate
heir
according
to
highland
principles
came
to
be
regarded
as
a
bastard
by
the
government
which
accordingly
considered
him
as
thereby
incapacitated
for
succeeding
to
the
honors
and
property
of
his
race
and
hence
originated
many
of
those
disputes
concerning
succession
and
chiefship
which
embroiled
families
with
one
another
as
well
as
with
the
government
and
were
productive
of
incredible
disorder
mischief
and
bloodshed
no
allowance
was
made
for
the
ancient
usages
of
the
people
which
were
probably
but
ill
understood
and
the
rights
of
rival
claimants
were
decided
according
to
the
principles
of
a
foreign
system
of
law
which
was
long
resisted
and
never
admitted
except
from
necessity
it
is
to
be
observed
however
that
the
highlanders
themselves
drew
a
broad
distinction
between
bastard
sons
and
the
issue
of
the
unions
above
described
the
former
were
rigorously
excluded
from
every
sort
of
succession
but
the
latter
were
considered
as
legitimate
as
the
offspring
of
the
most
regularly
solemnized
marriage
this
practice
obtained
not
only
among
chiefs
but
common
people
walter
scott
in
the
xxv
chapter
of
the
in
a
note
says
this
custom
of
actually
prevailed
in
the
upland
days
it
arose
partly
from
the
want
of
priests
while
the
convents
subsisted
monks
were
detached
on
regular
circuits
through
the
wilder
districts
to
marry
those
who
had
lived
in
this
species
of
connexion
a
practice
of
the
same
kind
existed
in
the
isle
of
portland
this
is
a
mistake
in
point
of
law
the
principle
of
legitimation
by
subsequent
marriage
was
first
explicitly
announced
in
an
imperial
constitution
of
constantine
and
being
wisely
recognized
by
the
church
it
was
adopted
by
the
canonists
through
whom
it
passed
into
our
law
the
attempt
to
introduce
it
into
england
failed
in
consequence
of
the
attachment
of
the
people
to
their
ancient
saxon
constitutions
and
hence
although
it
was
recognized
in
the
statutes
of
merton
it
was
subsequently
discarded
and
never
afterwards
found
admission
into
the
municipal
system
of
the
neighboring
kingdom
there
can
be
no
doubt
whatever
that
the
principle
is
one
which
reason
morality
and
religion
must
equally
approve

almost
any
one
of

older

we
have
before
us
while
writing
a
copy
made
some
years
since
by
ourselves
of
the
records
of
the
first
church
of
woodstock
covering
the
period

in
which
are
a
large
number
of
entries
mostly
the
names
of
parties
who
made
of
this
sort
before
that
church
these
cases
occur
most
frequently
between
the
years
and
our
own
observation
among
the
records
of
the
old
churches
in
windsor
and
east
windsor
is
in
effect
the
same
and
we
have
occasionally
happened
upon
the
original
manuscript
confessions
of
individuals
read
to
the
church
before
they
were
formally
admitted
to

government
haven
caused
the
mode
of
admission
into
the
church
to
be
altered
this
was
done
in
the
new
method
required
the
candidate
to
be
propounded
to
the
congregation
by
the
minister
if
no
objections
within
fourteen
days
were
made
he
was
then
of
course
admitted
at
the
same
time
the
church
covenant
and
creed
was
altered
and
made
very
general
in
its
expressions
this
creed
had
so
few
articles
that
all
persons
professing
and
calling
themselves
christians
would
assent
to
it
without
any
objections
the
church
had
ever
in
this
place
required
of
its
members
guilty
of
unlawful
cohabitation
before
marriage
a
public
confession
of
that
crime
before
the
whole
congregation
the
offending
female
stood
in
the
broad
aisle
beside
the
partner
of
her
guilt
if
they
had
been
married
the
declaration
of
the
man
was
silently
assented
to
by
the
woman
this
had
always
been
a
delicate
and
difficult
subject
for
church
discipline
the
public
confession
if
it
operated
as
a
corrective
likewise
produced
merriment
with
the
profane
i
have
seen
no
instance
of
a
public
confession
for
this
fault
until
the
ministry
of
dexter
and
then
they
were
extremely
rare
in
the
church
gave
the
confessing
parties
the
privilege
of
making
a
private
confession
to
the
church
in
the
room
of
a
public
confession
in
havens
ministry
the
number
of
cases
of
unlawful
cohabitation
increased
to
an
alarming
degree
for
years
before
cases
had
been
publicly
acknowledged
before
the
congregation
and
fourteen
cases
within
the
last
ten
years
this
brought
out
the
minister
to
preach
on
the
subject
from
the
pulpit
haven
in
a
long
and
memorable
discourse
sought
out
the
cause
of
the
growing
sin
and
suggested
the
proper
remedy
he
attributed
the
frequent
recurrence
of
the
fault
to
the
custom
then
prevalent
of
females
admitting
young
men
to
their
beds
who
sought
their
company
with
intentions
of
marriage
and
he
exhorted
all
to
abandon
that
custom
and
no
longer
expose
themselves
to
temptations
which
so
many
were
found
unable
to
resist
the
immediate
effect
of
this
discourse
on
the
congregation
has
been
described
to
me
and
was
such
as
we
must
naturally
suppose
it
would
be
a
grave
man
the
beloved
and
revered
pastor
of
the
congregation
comes
out
suddenly
on
his
audience
and
discusses
a
subject
on
which
mirth
and
merriment
only
had
been
heard
and
denounces
a
favorite
custom
the
females
blushed
and
hung
down
their
heads
the
men
too
hung
down
their
heads
and
now
and
then
looked
out
from
under
their
fallen
eyebrows
to
observe
how
others
supported
the
attack
if
the
outward
appearance
of
the
assembly
was
somewhat
composed
there
was
a
violent
internal
agitation
in
many
minds
and
now
when
years
have
expired
the
persons
who
were
present
at
the
delivery
of
that
sermon
express
its
effects
by
saying
queerly
i
felt
a
time
it
was

close
preaching
indeed
the
custom
was
abandoned
the
sexes
learned
to
cultivate
the
proper
degree
of
delicacy
in
their
intercourse
and
instances
of
unlawful
cohabitation
in
this
town
since
that
time
have
been
extremely
rare
history
of
pepperell
shirley
page
at
a
church
meeting
the
subject
of
compelling
persons
to
confess
themselves
guilty
of
an
offense
of
which
they
said
if
not
absolutely
yet
next
to
impossible
to
convict
them
was
acted
upon
and
some
relaxation
made
in
the
rule
before
adopted
but
a
part
of
the
record
is
so
worn
as
to
be
illegible

june
the
church

at
this
meeting
voted
in

a
proportion
not
indicative
of
good
customs
and
morals
a
typographical
mistake
for
but
this
was
as
late
as
to
when
the
custom
was
very
near
its
end
another
when
in
his
year
in
speaking
of
his
knowledge
of
the
custom
after

and
his
voice
trembled
more
from
emotion

a
very
appropriate

secure
