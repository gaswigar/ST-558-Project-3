i
miss

slowbridge
had
been
shaken
to
its
foundations
it
may
as
well
be
explained
however
at
the
outset
that
it
would
not
take
much
of
a
sensation
to
give
slowbridge
a
great
shock
in
the
first
place
slowbridge
was
not
used
to
sensations
and
was
used
to
going
on
the
even
and
respectable
tenor
of
its
way
regarding
the
outside
world
with
private
distrust
if
not
with
open
disfavor
the
new
mills
had
been
a
trial
to
slowbridge
a
sore
trial
on
being
told
of
the
owners
plan
of
building
them
old
lady
theobald
who
was
the
of
the
social
edifice
of
slowbridge
was
said
by
a
spectator
to
have
turned
deathly
pale
with
rage
and
on
the
first
day
of
their
being
opened
in
working
order
she
had
taken
to
her
bed
and
remained
shut
up
in
her
darkened
room
for
a
week
refusing
to
see
anybody
and
even
going
so
far
as
to
send
a
scathing
message
to
the
curate
of
james
who
called
in
fear
and
trembling
because
he
was
afraid
to
stay
away
with
mills
and
her
ladyship
announced
to
laurence
the
when
chance
first
threw
them
together
with
mills
and
come
murder
massacre
and
mob
law
and
she
said
it
so
loud
and
with
so
stern
an
air
of
conviction
that
the
two
misses
briarton
who
were
of
a
timorous
and
fearful
nature
dropped
their
buttered
muffins
it
was
at
one
of
the
which
were
slowbridge
only
dissipation
and
shuddered
hysterically
feeling
that
their
fate
was
sealed
and
that
they
might
any
night
find
three
masculine
secreted
under
their
beds
with
bludgeons
but
as
no
massacres
took
place
and
the
were
pretty
regular
in
their
habits
and
even
went
so
far
as
to
send
their
children
to
lady
theobald
free
school
and
accepted
the
tracts
left
weekly
at
their
doors
whether
they
could
read
or
not
slowbridge
gradually
recovered
from
the
shock
of
finding
itself
forced
to
exist
in
close
proximity
to
mills
and
was
just
settling
itself
to
sleep
the
sleep
of
the
just
again
when
as
i
have
said
it
was
shaken
to
its
foundations
it
was
miss
belinda
bassett
who
received
the
first
shock
miss
belinda
bassett
was
a
decorous
little
maiden
lady
who
lived
in
a
decorous
little
house
on
high
street
which
was
considered
a
very
genteel
street
in
slowbridge
she
had
lived
in
the
same
house
all
her
life
her
father
had
lived
in
it
and
so
also
had
her
grandfather
she
had
gone
out
to
take
tea
from
its
doors
two
or
three
times
a
week
ever
since
she
had
been
twenty
and
she
had
had
her
little
in
its
front
parlor
as
often
as
any
other
genteel
slowbridge
entertainer
she
had
risen
at
seven
breakfasted
at
eight
dined
at
two
taken
tea
at
five
and
gone
to
bed
at
ten
with
such
regularity
for
fifty
years
that
to
rise
at
eight
breakfast
at
nine
dine
at
three
and
take
tea
at
six
and
go
to
bed
at
eleven
would
she
was
firmly
convinced
be
but
to
fly
in
the
face
of
providence
as
she
put
it
and
sign
her
own
consequently
it
is
easy
to
imagine
what
a
tremor
and
excitement
seized
her
when
one
afternoon
as
she
sat
waiting
for
her
tea
a
coach
from
the
blue
lion
dashed
or
at
least
dashed
up
to
the
front
door
a
young
lady
got
out
and
the
next
minute
the
handmaiden
mary
anne
threw
open
the
door
of
the
parlor
announcing
without
the
least
preface
your
niece
mum
from
miss
belinda
got
up
feeling
that
her
knees
really
trembled
beneath
her
in
slowbridge
america
was
not
approved
of
in
fact
was
almost
entirely
ignored
as
a
country
where
to
quote
lady
theobald
the
laws
were
loose
and
the
prevailing
sentiments
revolutionary
it
was
not
considered
good
taste
to
know
americans
which
was
not
unfortunate
as
there
were
none
to
know
and
miss
belinda
bassett
had
always
felt
a
delicacy
in
mentioning
her
only
brother
who
had
emigrated
to
the
united
states
in
his
youth
having
first
disgraced
himself
by
the
utterance
of
the
blasphemous
remark
that
he
wanted
to
get
to
a
place
where
a
fellow
could
stretch
himself
and
not
be
bullied
by
a
lot
of
old
tabbies
from
the
day
of
his
departure
when
he
had
left
miss
belinda
bathed
in
tears
of
anguish
she
had
heard
nothing
of
him
and
here
upon
the
threshold
stood
mary
anne
with
delighted
eagerness
in
her
countenance
repeating
your
niece
mum
from
and
with
the
words
her
niece
entered
miss
belinda
put
her
hand
to
her
heart
the
young
lady
thus
announced
was
the
prettiest
and
at
the
same
time
the
most
young
lady
she
had
ever
seen
in
her
life
slowbridge
contained
nothing
approaching
this
niece
her
dress
was
so
very
stylish
that
it
was
quite
startling
in
its
effect
her
forehead
was
covered
down
to
her
large
pretty
eyes
themselves
with
curls
of
hair
and
her
slender
throat
was
swathed
round
and
round
with
a
grand
scarf
of
black
lace
she
made
a
step
forward
and
then
stopped
looking
at
miss
belinda
her
eyes
suddenly
to
miss
belinda
amazement
filled
with
tears
did
you
she
said
oh
dear
you
get
the
letter
the
the
letter
faltered
miss
belinda
what
letter
my
my
dear
pa
was
the
answer
oh
i
see
you
did
and
she
sank
into
the
nearest
chair
putting
her
hands
up
to
her
face
and
beginning
to
cry
outright
i
am
octavia
she
said
we
were
coming
to
you
and
travel
in
europe
but
the
mines
went
wrong
and
was
obliged
to
go
back
to
nevada
the
mines
gasped
miss
belinda
wept
octavia
and
we
had
scarcely
landed
when
piper
cabled
and
pa
had
to
turn
back
it
was
something
about
shares
and
he
may
have
lost
his
last
dollar
miss
belinda
sank
into
a
chair
herself
mary
anne
she
said
faintly
bring
me
a
glass
of
water
her
tone
was
such
that
octavia
removed
her
handkerchief
from
her
eyes
and
sat
up
to
examine
her
are
you
frightened
she
asked
in
some
alarm
miss
belinda
took
a
sip
of
the
water
brought
by
her
handmaiden
replaced
the
glass
upon
the
salver
and
shook
her
head
deprecatingly
not
exactly
frightened
my
dear
she
said
but
so
amazed
that
i
find
it
difficult
to
to
collect
myself
octavia
put
up
her
handkerchief
again
to
wipe
away
a
sudden
new
gush
of
tears
if
shares
intended
to
go
down
she
said
i
do
see
why
they
go
down
before
we
started
instead
of
waiting
until
we
got
over
here
and
then
spoiling
every
thing
providence
my
dear
began
miss
belinda
but
she
was
interrupted
by
the
of
mary
anne
the
man
from
the
lion
mum
wants
to
know
what
to
be
done
with
the
trunks
there
six
of
an
they
all
that
as
he
says
he
would
lift
one
alone
for
ten
shilling
six
exclaimed
miss
belinda
whose
are
they
mine
replied
octavia
wait
a
minute
i
go
out
to
him
miss
belinda
was
astounded
afresh
by
the
alacrity
with
which
her
niece
seemed
to
forget
her
troubles
and
rise
to
the
occasion
the
girl
ran
to
the
front
door
as
if
she
was
quite
used
to
directing
her
own
affairs
and
began
to
issue
her
orders
you
will
have
to
get
another
man
she
said
you
might
have
known
that
go
and
get
one
somewhere
and
when
the
man
went
off
grumbling
a
little
and
evidently
rather
at
a
loss
before
such
peremptory
coolness
she
turned
to
miss
belinda
where
must
he
put
them
she
asked
it
did
not
seem
to
have
occurred
to
her
once
that
her
identity
might
be
doubted
and
some
slight
obstacles
arise
before
her
i
am
afraid
faltered
miss
belinda
that
five
of
them
will
have
to
be
put
in
the
attic
and
in
fifteen
minutes
five
of
them
put
into
the
attic
and
the
sixth
the
biggest
of
all
stood
in
the
trim
little
spare
chamber
and
pretty
miss
octavia
had
sunk
into
a
puffy
little
while
her
newly
found
relative
stood
before
her
making
the
most
laudable
efforts
to
recover
her
equilibrium
and
not
to
feel
as
if
her
head
were
spinning
round
and
round
chapter
ii
an
investment
anyway
the
natural
result
of
these
efforts
was
that
miss
belinda
was
moved
to
shed
a
few
tears
i
hope
you
will
excuse
my
being
too
startled
to
say
i
was
glad
to
see
you
she
said
i
have
not
seen
my
brother
for
thirty
years
and
i
was
very
fond
of
him
he
said
you
were
answered
octavia
and
he
was
very
fond
of
you
too
he
did
write
to
you
because
he
made
up
his
mind
not
to
let
you
hear
from
him
until
he
was
a
rich
man
and
then
he
thought
he
would
wait
until
he
could
come
home
and
surprise
you
he
was
awfully
disappointed
when
he
had
to
go
back
without
seeing
you
poor
dear
martin
wept
miss
belinda
gently
such
a
journey
octavia
opened
her
charming
eyes
in
surprise
oh
he
come
back
again
she
said
and
he
does
mind
the
journey
the
journey
is
nothing
you
know
nothing
echoed
miss
belinda
a
voyage
across
the
atlantic
nothing
when
one
thinks
of
the
danger
my
dear
octavia
eyes
opened
a
shade
wider
we
have
made
the
trip
to
the
states
across
the
isthmus
twelve
times
and
that
takes
a
month
she
remarked
so
we
do
think
ten
days
much
twelve
times
said
miss
belinda
quite
appalled
dear
dear
dear
and
for
some
moments
she
could
do
nothing
but
look
at
her
young
relative
in
doubtful
wonder
shaking
her
head
with
actual
sadness
but
she
finally
recovered
herself
with
a
little
start
what
am
i
thinking
of
she
exclaimed
remorsefully
to
let
you
sit
here
in
this
way
pray
excuse
me
my
dear
you
see
i
am
so
upset
she
left
her
chair
in
a
great
hurry
and
proceeded
to
embrace
her
young
guest
tenderly
though
with
a
little
timorousness
the
young
lady
submitted
to
the
caress
with
much
composure
did
i
upset
you
she
inquired
calmly
the
fact
was
that
she
could
not
see
why
the
simple
advent
of
a
relative
from
nevada
should
seem
to
have
the
effect
of
an
earthquake
and
result
in
tremor
confusion
and
tears
it
was
true
she
herself
had
shed
a
tear
or
so
but
then
her
troubles
had
been
accumulating
for
several
days
and
she
had
not
felt
confused
yet
when
miss
belinda
went
to
superintend
mary
anne
in
the
and
left
her
guest
alone
that
young
person
glanced
about
her
with
a
rather
dubious
expression
it
is
a
queer
nice
little
place
she
said
but
i
do
wonder
that
pa
emigrated
if
they
always
get
into
such
a
flurry
about
little
things
i
might
have
been
a
ghost
then
she
proceeded
to
unlock
the
big
trunk
and
attire
herself
miss
belinda
was
wavering
between
the
kitchen
and
the
parlor
in
a
kindly
flutter
toast
some
muffins
mary
anne
and
bring
in
the
cold
roast
fowl
she
said
and
i
will
put
out
some
and
some
of
the
preserved
ginger
dear
me
just
to
think
how
fond
of
preserved
ginger
poor
martin
was
and
how
little
of
it
he
was
allowed
to
eat
there
really
seems
a
special
providence
in
my
having
such
a
nice
stock
of
it
in
the
house
when
his
daughter
comes
home
in
the
course
of
half
an
hour
every
thing
was
in
readiness
and
then
mary
anne
who
had
been
sent
to
announce
the
fact
came
down
in
a
most
remarkable
state
of
delighted
agitation
suppressed
ecstasy
and
amazement
exclaiming
aloud
in
every
feature
she
dressed
mum
she
announced
an
be
down
immediate
and
retired
to
a
shadowy
corner
of
the
kitchen
passage
that
she
might
lie
in
wait
unobserved
miss
belinda
sitting
behind
the
heard
a
soft
flowing
silken
rustle
sweeping
down
the
staircase
and
across
the
hall
and
then
her
niece
entered
do
you
think
i
dressed
pretty
quick
she
said
and
swept
across
the
little
parlor
and
sat
down
in
her
place
with
the
calmest
and
most
unconscious
air
in
the
world
there
was
in
slowbridge
but
one
dressmaking
establishment
the
head
of
the
establishment
miss
letitia
chickie
designed
the
costumes
of
every
woman
in
slowbridge
from
lady
theobald
down
there
were
legends
that
she
received
her
patterns
from
london
and
modified
them
to
suit
the
slowbridge
taste
possibly
this
was
true
but
in
that
case
her
labors
as
modifier
must
have
been
severe
indeed
since
they
were
so
far
modified
as
to
be
altogether
unrecognizable
when
they
left
miss
establishment
and
were
borne
home
in
triumph
to
the
houses
of
her
patrons
the
taste
of
slowbridge
was
quiet
upon
this
slowbridge
prided
itself
especially
and
at
the
same
time
tended
toward
economy
when
gores
came
into
fashion
slowbridge
clung
firmly
and
with
some
pride
to
substantial
breadths
which
did
not
cut
good
silk
into
useless
strips
which
could
not
be
utilized
in
and
it
was
only
when
after
a
visit
to
london
lady
theobald
walked
into
james
one
sunday
with
two
gores
on
each
side
that
miss
chickie
regretfully
put
scissors
into
her
first
breadth
each
matronly
member
of
good
society
possessed
a
substantial
silk
gown
of
some
sober
color
which
gown
having
done
duty
at
two
years
descended
to
the
grade
of
and
so
descended
year
by
year
until
it
disappeared
into
the
dim
distance
of
the
past
the
young
ladies
had
their
white
muslins
and
natural
flowers
which
latter
decorations
invariably
collapsed
in
the
course
of
the
evening
and
were
worn
during
the
latter
half
of
any
festive
occasion
in
a
flabby
and
hopeless
condition
miss
chickie
made
the
muslins
festooning
and
adorning
them
after
designs
emanating
from
her
fertile
imagination
if
they
were
a
little
short
in
the
body
and
not
very
generously
proportioned
in
the
matter
of
train
there
was
no
rival
establishment
to
sneer
and
miss
chickie
had
it
all
her
own
way
and
at
least
it
could
never
be
said
that
slowbridge
was
vulgar
or
overdressed
judge
then
of
miss
belinda
bassett
condition
of
mind
when
her
fair
relative
took
her
seat
before
her
what
the
material
of
her
niece
dress
was
miss
belinda
could
not
have
told
it
was
a
silken
and
soft
fabric
of
a
pale
blue
color
it
clung
to
the
slender
lissome
young
figure
like
a
glove
a
train
of
great
length
almost
covered
the
there
were
plaitings
and
frillings
all
over
it
and
yards
of
delicate
satin
ribbon
cut
into
loops
in
the
most
recklessly
extravagant
manner
miss
belinda
saw
all
this
at
the
first
glance
as
mary
anne
had
seen
it
and
like
mary
anne
lost
her
breath
but
on
her
second
glance
she
saw
something
more
on
the
pretty
slight
hands
were
three
wonderful
sparkling
rings
composed
of
diamonds
set
in
clusters
there
were
great
solitaires
in
the
neat
little
ears
and
the
lace
at
the
throat
was
fastened
by
a
diamond
clasp
my
dear
said
miss
belinda
clutching
helplessly
at
the
teapot
are
you
surely
it
is
a
a
little
dangerous
to
wear
such
such
priceless
ornaments
on
ordinary
occasions
octavia
stared
at
her
for
a
moment
uncomprehendingly
your
jewels
i
mean
my
love
fluttered
miss
belinda
surely
you
wear
them
often
i
declare
it
quite
frightens
me
to
think
of
having
such
things
in
the
house
does
it
said
octavia
that
queer
and
she
looked
puzzled
for
a
moment
again
then
she
glanced
down
at
her
rings
i
nearly
always
wear
these
she
remarked
father
gave
them
to
me
he
gave
me
one
each
birthday
for
three
years
he
says
diamonds
are
an
investment
anyway
and
i
might
as
well
have
them
these
touching
the
and
clasp
were
given
to
my
mother
when
she
was
on
the
stage
a
lot
of
people
clubbed
together
and
bought
them
for
her
she
was
a
great
favorite
miss
belinda
made
another
clutch
at
the
handle
of
the
teapot
your
mother
she
exclaimed
faintly
on
the
did
you
say
on
the
stage
answered
octavia
san
francisco
father
married
her
there
she
was
awfully
pretty
i
do
remember
her
she
died
when
i
was
born
she
was
only
nineteen
the
utter
calmness
and
freedom
from
embarrassment
with
which
these
announcements
were
made
almost
shook
miss
belinda
faith
in
her
own
identity
strange
to
say
until
this
moment
she
had
scarcely
given
a
thought
to
her
brother
wife
and
to
find
herself
sitting
in
her
own
genteel
little
parlor
behind
her
own
with
her
hand
upon
her
own
teapot
hearing
that
this
wife
had
been
a
young
person
who
had
been
a
great
favorite
upon
the
stage
in
a
region
peopled
as
she
had
been
led
to
suppose
by
and
escaped
convicts
was
almost
too
much
for
her
to
support
herself
under
but
she
did
support
herself
bravely
when
she
had
time
to
rally
help
yourself
to
some
fowl
my
dear
she
said
hospitably
even
though
very
faintly
indeed
and
take
a
muffin
octavia
did
so
her
hands
flashing
in
the
light
as
she
moved
them
american
girls
always
have
more
things
than
english
girls
she
observed
with
admirable
coolness
they
dress
more
i
have
been
told
so
by
girls
who
have
been
in
europe
and
i
have
more
things
than
most
american
girls
father
had
more
money
than
most
people
that
was
one
reason
and
he
spoiled
me
i
suppose
he
had
no
one
else
to
give
things
to
and
he
said
i
should
have
every
thing
i
took
a
fancy
to
he
often
laughed
at
me
for
buying
things
but
he
never
said
i
should
buy
them
he
was
always
generous
sighed
miss
belinda
poor
dear
martin
octavia
scarcely
entered
into
the
spirit
of
this
mournful
sympathy
she
was
fond
of
her
father
but
her
recollections
of
him
were
not
pathetic
or
sentimental
he
took
me
with
him
wherever
he
went
she
proceeded
and
we
had
a
teacher
from
the
states
who
travelled
with
us
sometimes
he
never
sent
me
away
from
him
i
would
have
gone
if
he
had
wanted
to
send
me
and
he
did
want
to
she
added
with
a
satisfied
little
laugh
chapter
iii
miss
belinda
sat
looking
at
her
niece
with
a
sense
of
being
at
once
stunned
and
fascinated
to
see
a
creature
so
young
so
pretty
so
luxuriously
splendid
and
at
the
same
time
so
simply
and
completely
at
ease
with
herself
and
her
surroundings
was
a
revelation
quite
beyond
her
comprehension
the
and
nicest
girls
slowbridge
could
produce
were
apt
to
look
a
trifle
conscious
and
timid
when
they
found
themselves
attired
in
the
white
muslin
and
floral
decorations
but
this
slender
creature
sat
in
her
gorgeous
attire
her
train
flowing
over
the
modest
carpet
her
rings
flashing
her
twinkling
apparently
entirely
oblivious
of
or
indifferent
to
the
fact
that
all
her
belongings
were
sufficiently
out
of
place
to
be
startling
beyond
measure
her
chief
characteristic
however
seemed
to
be
her
excessive
frankness
she
did
not
hesitate
at
all
to
make
the
most
remarkable
statements
concerning
her
own
and
her
father
past
career
she
made
them
too
as
if
there
was
nothing
unusual
about
them
twice
in
her
childhood
a
luckless
speculation
had
left
her
father
penniless
and
once
he
had
taken
her
to
a
californian
camp
where
she
had
been
the
only
female
member
of
the
somewhat
reckless
community
but
they
were
pretty
and
made
a
pet
of
me
she
said
and
we
did
not
stay
very
long
father
had
a
stroke
of
luck
and
we
went
away
i
was
sorry
when
we
had
to
go
and
so
were
the
men
they
made
me
a
present
of
a
set
of
jewelry
made
out
of
the
gold
they
had
got
themselves
there
is
a
breastpin
like
a
breastplate
and
a
necklace
like
a
the
bracelets
tire
my
arms
and
the
pull
my
ears
but
i
wear
them
sometimes
gold
girdle
and
all
did
i
inquired
miss
belinda
timidly
did
i
understand
you
to
say
my
dear
that
your
father
business
was
in
some
way
connected
with
it
was
the
response
he
owns
some
mines
you
know
owns
said
miss
belinda
much
fluttered
owns
some
he
must
be
a
very
rich
man
a
very
rich
man
i
declare
it
quite
takes
my
breath
away
oh
he
is
rich
said
octavia
awfully
rich
sometimes
and
then
again
he
is
shares
go
up
you
know
and
then
they
go
down
and
you
seem
to
have
any
thing
but
father
generally
comes
out
right
because
he
is
lucky
and
knows
how
to
manage
but
but
how
uncertain
gasped
miss
belinda
i
should
be
perfectly
miserable
poor
dear
mar
oh
no
you
would
said
octavia
you
get
used
to
it
and
mind
much
particularly
if
you
were
lucky
as
father
is
there
is
every
thing
in
being
lucky
and
knowing
how
to
manage
when
we
first
went
to
bloody
gulch
my
dear
cried
miss
belinda
aghast
i
i
beg
of
you
octavia
stopped
short
she
gazed
at
miss
belinda
in
bewilderment
as
she
had
done
several
times
before
is
any
thing
the
matter
she
inquired
placidly
my
dear
love
explained
miss
belinda
innocently
determined
at
least
to
do
her
duty
it
is
not
customary
in
in
slowbridge
in
fact
i
think
i
may
say
in
england
to
use
such
such
exceedingly
i
do
want
to
wound
your
feelings
my
dear
but
such
exceedingly
strong
expressions
i
refer
my
dear
to
the
one
which
began
with
a
b
it
is
really
considered
profane
as
well
as
dreadful
beyond
measure
one
which
began
with
a
b
repeated
octavia
still
staring
at
her
that
is
the
name
of
a
place
but
i
did
name
it
you
know
it
was
called
that
in
the
first
place
because
a
party
of
men
were
surprised
and
murdered
there
while
they
were
asleep
in
their
camp
at
night
it
is
a
very
nice
name
of
course
but
i
not
responsible
for
it
and
besides
now
the
place
is
growing
they
are
going
to
call
it
athens
or
magnolia
vale
they
tried
for
a
while
but
people
would
call
it
lodginville
and
nobody
liked
it
i
trust
you
never
lived
there
said
miss
belinda
i
beg
your
pardon
for
being
so
horrified
but
i
really
could
not
refrain
from
starting
when
you
spoke
and
i
can
not
help
hoping
you
never
lived
there
i
live
there
now
when
i
am
at
home
octavia
replied
the
mines
are
there
and
father
has
built
a
house
and
had
the
furniture
brought
on
from
new
york
miss
belinda
tried
not
to
shudder
but
almost
failed
wo
you
take
another
muffin
my
love
she
said
with
a
sigh
do
take
another
muffin
no
thank
you
answered
octavia
and
it
must
be
confessed
that
she
looked
a
little
bored
as
she
leaned
back
in
her
chair
and
glanced
down
at
the
train
of
her
dress
it
seemed
to
her
that
her
simplest
statement
or
remark
created
a
sensation
having
at
last
risen
from
the
she
wandered
to
the
window
and
stood
there
looking
out
at
miss
belinda
it
was
quite
a
pretty
and
a
one
considering
the
dimensions
of
the
house
there
were
an
oval
divers
gravel
paths
heart
and
diamond
shaped
beds
aglow
with
brilliant
annuals
a
great
many
several
laburnums
and
lilacs
and
a
trim
hedge
of
holly
surrounding
it
i
think
i
should
like
to
go
out
and
walk
around
there
remarked
octavia
smothering
a
little
yawn
behind
her
hand
suppose
we
go
if
you
do
care
certainly
my
dear
assented
miss
belinda
but
perhaps
with
a
delicately
dubious
glance
at
her
attire
you
would
like
to
make
some
little
alteration
in
your
dress
to
put
something
a
little
dark
over
it
octavia
glanced
down
also
oh
no
she
replied
it
will
do
well
enough
i
will
throw
a
scarf
over
my
head
though
not
because
i
need
it
unblushingly
but
because
i
have
a
lace
one
that
is
very
becoming
she
went
up
to
her
room
for
the
article
in
question
and
in
three
minutes
was
down
again
when
she
first
caught
sight
of
her
miss
belinda
found
herself
obliged
to
clear
her
throat
quite
suddenly
what
slowbridge
would
think
of
seeing
such
a
toilet
in
her
front
garden
upon
an
ordinary
occasion
she
could
not
imagine
the
scarf
truly
was
becoming
it
was
a
long
affair
of
rich
white
lace
and
was
thrown
over
the
girl
head
wound
around
her
throat
and
the
ends
tossed
over
her
shoulders
with
the
most
picturesque
air
of
carelessness
in
the
world
you
look
quite
like
a
bride
my
dear
octavia
said
miss
belinda
we
are
scarcely
used
to
such
things
in
slowbridge
but
octavia
only
laughed
a
little
i
am
going
to
get
some
pink
roses
and
fasten
the
ends
with
them
when
we
get
into
the
garden
she
said
she
stopped
for
this
purpose
at
the
first
they
reached
she
gathered
half
a
dozen
buds
and
having
fastened
the
lace
with
some
was
carelessly
placing
the
rest
at
her
waist
when
miss
belinda
started
violently
chapter
iv
lady
theobald
oh
dear
she
exclaimed
nervously
there
is
lady
theobald
lady
theobald
having
been
making
calls
of
state
was
returning
home
rather
later
than
usual
when
in
driving
up
high
street
her
eye
fell
upon
miss
bassett
garden
she
put
up
her
eyeglasses
and
gazed
through
them
severely
then
she
issued
a
mandate
to
her
coachman
dobson
she
said
drive
more
slowly
she
could
not
believe
the
evidence
of
her
own
eyeglasses
in
miss
bassett
garden
she
saw
a
tall
girl
dressed
as
she
put
it
like
an
actress
her
delicate
dress
trailing
upon
the
grass
a
white
lace
scarf
about
her
head
and
shoulders
roses
in
that
scarf
roses
at
her
waist
good
heavens
she
exclaimed
is
belinda
bassett
giving
a
party
without
so
much
as
mentioning
it
to
then
she
issued
another
mandate
dobson
she
said
drive
faster
and
drive
me
to
miss
bassett
miss
belinda
came
out
to
the
gate
to
meet
her
quaking
inwardly
octavia
simply
turned
slightly
where
she
stood
and
looked
at
her
ladyship
without
any
pretence
of
concealing
her
curiosity
lady
theobald
bent
forward
in
her
landau
belinda
she
said
how
do
you
do
i
did
not
know
you
intended
to
introduce
into
slowbridge
dear
lady
theobald
began
miss
belinda
who
is
that
young
person
demanded
her
ladyship
she
is
poor
dear
martin
daughter
answered
miss
belinda
she
arrived
from
nevada
where
where
it
appears
martin
has
been
very
fortunate
and
owns
a
great
many
a
many
cried
lady
theobald
are
you
mad
belinda
bassett
i
am
ashamed
of
you
at
your
time
of
life
too
miss
belinda
almost
shed
tears
she
said
i
am
sure
she
faltered
for
i
remember
how
astonished
and
bewildered
i
was
the
fact
is
that
she
is
such
a
very
singular
girl
and
has
told
me
so
many
wonderful
things
in
the
strangest
cool
way
that
i
am
quite
uncertain
of
myself
murderers
and
and
and
camps
full
of
men
without
women
making
presents
of
gold
girdles
and
and
that
drag
your
ears
down
it
is
enough
to
upset
any
one
i
should
think
so
responded
her
ladyship
open
the
belinda
and
let
me
get
out
she
felt
that
this
matter
must
be
inquired
into
at
once
and
not
allowed
to
go
too
far
she
had
ruled
slowbridge
too
long
to
allow
such
innovations
to
remain
uninvestigated
she
would
not
be
likely
to
be
upset
at
least
she
descended
from
her
landau
with
her
most
rigorous
air
her
stout
rich
black
gown
rustled
severely
the
yellow
ostrich
feather
in
her
bonnet
waved
majestically
being
a
brunette
and
lady
theobald
she
wore
yellow
as
she
tramped
up
the
gravel
walk
she
held
up
her
dress
with
both
hands
as
an
example
to
vulgar
and
reckless
young
people
who
wore
trains
and
left
them
to
take
care
of
themselves
octavia
was
arranging
afresh
the
bunch
of
swaying
buds
at
her
waist
and
she
was
giving
all
her
attention
to
her
task
when
her
visitor
first
addressed
her
how
do
you
do
remarked
her
ladyship
in
a
fine
deep
voice
miss
belinda
followed
her
meekly
octavia
she
explained
this
is
lady
theobald
whom
you
will
be
very
glad
to
know
she
knew
your
father
yes
returned
my
lady
years
ago
he
has
had
time
to
improve
since
then
how
do
you
do
octavia
limpid
eyes
rested
serenely
upon
her
how
do
you
do
she
said
rather
indifferently
you
are
from
nevada
asked
lady
theobald
yes
it
is
not
long
since
you
left
there
octavia
smiled
faintly
do
i
look
like
that
she
inquired
like
what
said
my
lady
as
if
i
had
not
long
lived
in
a
civilized
place
i
dare
say
i
do
because
it
is
true
that
i
have
you
do
look
like
an
english
girl
remarked
her
ladyship
octavia
smiled
again
she
looked
at
the
yellow
feather
and
stout
dress
but
quite
as
if
by
accident
and
without
any
mental
deduction
then
she
glanced
at
the
rosebuds
in
her
hand
i
suppose
i
ought
to
be
sorry
for
that
she
observed
i
dare
say
i
shall
be
in
time
when
i
have
been
longer
away
from
nevada
i
must
confess
admitted
her
ladyship
and
evidently
without
the
least
regret
or
embarrassment
i
must
confess
that
i
do
know
where
nevada
is
it
is
in
europe
replied
octavia
with
a
soft
light
laugh
you
know
that
do
you
the
words
themselves
sounded
to
lady
theobald
like
the
most
outrageous
impudence
but
when
she
looked
at
the
pretty
face
she
was
staggered
the
look
it
wore
was
such
a
very
innocent
and
undisturbed
one
at
the
moment
the
only
solution
to
be
reached
seemed
to
be
that
this
was
the
style
of
young
people
in
nevada
and
that
it
was
ignorance
and
not
insolence
she
had
to
do
battle
with
which
indeed
was
partially
true
i
have
not
had
any
occasion
to
inquire
where
it
is
situated
so
far
she
responded
firmly
it
is
not
so
necessary
for
english
people
to
know
america
as
it
is
for
americans
to
know
england
is
it
said
octavia
without
any
great
show
of
interest
why
not
for
for
a
great
many
reasons
it
would
be
fatiguing
to
explain
she
answered
courageously
how
is
your
father
he
is
very
now
was
the
smiling
answer
deadly
he
has
been
out
just
hours
out
what
does
that
mean
out
on
the
atlantic
he
was
called
back
suddenly
and
obliged
to
leave
me
that
is
why
i
came
here
alone
pray
do
come
into
the
parlor
and
sit
down
dear
lady
theobald
ventured
miss
belinda
octavia
do
you
think
it
is
nicer
out
here
said
octavia
my
dear
answered
miss
belinda
lady
theobald
she
was
really
quite
shocked
ah
interposed
octavia
i
only
thought
it
was
cooler
she
preceded
them
without
seeming
to
be
at
all
conscious
that
she
was
taking
the
lead
you
had
better
pick
up
your
dress
miss
octavia
said
lady
theobald
rather
acidly
the
girl
glanced
over
her
shoulder
at
the
length
of
train
sweeping
the
path
but
she
made
no
movement
toward
picking
it
up
it
is
too
much
trouble
and
one
has
to
duck
down
so
she
said
it
is
bad
enough
to
have
to
keep
doing
it
when
one
is
on
the
street
besides
they
would
never
wear
out
if
one
took
too
much
care
of
them
when
they
went
into
the
parlor
and
sat
down
lady
theobald
made
excellent
use
of
her
time
and
managed
to
hear
again
all
that
had
tried
and
bewildered
miss
belinda
she
had
no
hesitation
in
asking
questions
boldly
she
considered
it
her
privilege
to
do
so
she
had
catechised
slowbridge
for
forty
years
and
meant
to
maintain
her
rights
until
time
played
her
the
knave
trick
of
disabling
her
in
half
an
hour
she
had
heard
about
the
the
and
she
knew
that
martin
bassett
was
a
millionnaire
if
the
news
he
had
heard
had
not
left
him
penniless
that
he
would
return
to
england
and
visit
slowbridge
as
soon
as
his
affairs
were
settled
the
precarious
condition
of
his
finances
did
not
seem
to
cause
octavia
much
concern
she
had
asked
no
questions
when
he
went
away
and
seemed
quite
at
ease
regarding
the
future
people
will
always
lend
him
money
and
then
he
is
lucky
with
it
she
said
she
bore
the
catechising
very
well
her
replies
were
frequently
rather
trying
to
her
interlocutor
but
she
never
seemed
troubled
or
ashamed
of
any
thing
she
had
to
say
and
she
wore
from
first
to
last
that
inscrutably
innocent
and
indifferent
little
air
she
did
not
even
show
confusion
when
lady
theobald
on
going
away
made
her
farewell
comment
you
are
a
very
fortunate
girl
to
own
such
jewels
she
said
glancing
critically
at
the
diamonds
in
her
ears
but
if
you
take
my
advice
my
dear
you
will
put
them
away
and
save
them
until
you
are
a
married
woman
it
is
not
customary
on
this
side
of
the
water
for
young
girls
to
wear
such
things
particularly
on
ordinary
occasions
people
will
think
you
are
odd
it
is
not
exactly
customary
in
america
replied
octavia
with
her
undisturbed
smile
there
are
not
many
girls
who
have
such
things
perhaps
they
would
wear
them
if
they
had
them
i
do
care
a
very
great
deal
about
them
but
i
mean
to
wear
them
lady
theobald
went
away
in
a
dudgeon
you
will
have
to
exercise
your
authority
belinda
and
her
put
them
away
she
said
to
miss
bassett
it
is
absurd
besides
being
atrocious
make
her
faltered
miss
bassett
yes
her
though
i
see
you
will
have
your
hands
full
i
never
heard
such
romancing
stories
in
my
life
it
is
just
what
one
might
expect
from
your
brother
martin
when
miss
bassett
returned
octavia
was
standing
before
the
window
watching
the
carriage
drive
away
and
playing
absently
with
one
of
her
as
she
did
so
what
an
old
fright
she
is
was
her
first
guileless
remark
miss
belinda
quite
bridled
my
dear
she
said
with
dignity
no
one
in
slowbridge
would
think
of
applying
such
a
phrase
to
lady
theobald
octavia
turned
around
and
looked
at
her
but
do
you
think
she
is
one
she
exclaimed
perhaps
i
ought
to
have
said
it
but
you
know
we
have
any
thing
as
bad
as
that
even
out
in
nevada
really
my
dear
said
miss
belinda
different
countries
contain
different
people
and
in
slowbridge
have
our
standards
her
best
cap
trembling
a
little
with
her
repressed
excitement
but
octavia
did
not
appear
overwhelmed
by
the
existence
of
the
standards
in
question
she
turned
to
the
window
again
well
anyway
she
said
i
think
it
was
pretty
cool
in
her
to
order
me
to
take
off
my
diamonds
and
save
them
until
i
was
married
how
does
she
know
whether
i
mean
to
be
married
or
not
i
do
know
that
i
care
about
it
chapter
lucia
in
this
manner
slowbridge
received
the
shock
which
shook
it
to
its
foundations
and
it
was
a
shock
from
which
it
did
not
recover
for
some
time
before
ten
the
next
morning
everybody
knew
of
the
arrival
of
martin
bassett
daughter
the
very
miss
pilcher
select
seminary
for
young
ladies
combining
the
comforts
of
a
home
as
the
circular
said
with
all
the
advantages
of
genteel
education
was
on
fire
with
it
highly
colored
versions
of
the
stories
told
being
circulated
from
the
first
class
downward
even
taking
the
form
of
an
indian
princess
tattooed
blue
and
with
difficulty
restrained
from
indulging
in
which
last
feature
so
alarmed
little
miss
bigbee
aged
seven
that
she
retired
in
fear
and
trembling
and
shed
tears
under
the
bedclothes
her
terror
and
anguish
being
much
increased
by
the
stirring
recitals
of
by
pretty
miss
phipps
of
the
first
class
a
young
person
who
possessed
a
vivid
imagination
and
delighted
in
romances
of
a
tragic
turn
i
have
not
the
slightest
doubt
said
miss
phipps
that
when
she
is
at
home
she
lives
in
a
wampum
what
is
a
wampum
inquired
one
of
her
admiring
audience
a
tent
replied
miss
phipps
with
some
impatience
i
should
think
any
goose
would
know
that
it
is
a
kind
of
tent
hung
with
scalps
and
and
moccasins
and
lariats
and
things
of
that
sort
i
do
believe
that
is
the
right
name
for
it
put
in
miss
smith
who
was
a
pert
member
of
the
third
class
ah
commented
miss
phipps
that
was
miss
smith
who
spoke
of
course
we
may
always
expect
information
from
miss
smith
i
trust
that
i
may
be
allowed
to
say
that
i
i
a
brother
he
does
know
much
about
it
if
he
calls
a
wigwam
a
wampum
interposed
miss
smith
with
still
greater
pertness
i
have
a
brother
who
knows
better
than
that
if
i
am
only
in
the
third
class
for
a
moment
miss
phipps
appeared
to
be
meditating
perhaps
she
was
a
trifle
discomfited
but
she
recovered
herself
after
a
brief
pause
and
returned
to
the
charge
well
she
remarked
perhaps
it
is
a
wigwam
who
cares
if
it
is
and
at
any
rate
whatever
it
is
i
have
the
slightest
doubt
that
she
lives
in
one
this
comparatively
tame
version
was
however
entirely
discarded
when
the
diamonds
and
began
to
figure
more
largely
in
the
reports
certainly
pretty
overdressed
octavia
gave
slowbridge
abundant
cause
for
excitement
after
leaving
her
lady
theobald
drove
home
to
oldclough
hall
rather
out
of
humor
she
had
been
rather
out
of
humor
for
some
time
having
never
quite
recovered
from
her
anger
at
the
daring
of
that
cheerful
builder
of
mills
john
burmistone
burmistone
had
been
one
innovation
and
octavia
bassett
was
another
she
had
not
been
able
to
manage
burmistone
and
she
was
not
at
all
sure
that
she
had
managed
octavia
bassett
she
entered
the
with
an
ominous
frown
on
her
forehead
at
the
end
of
the
table
opposite
her
own
seat
was
a
vacant
chair
and
her
frown
deepened
when
she
saw
it
where
is
miss
gaston
she
demanded
of
the
servant
before
the
man
had
time
to
reply
the
door
opened
and
a
girl
came
in
hurriedly
with
a
somewhat
frightened
air
i
beg
pardon
grandmamma
dear
she
said
going
to
her
seat
quickly
i
did
not
know
you
had
come
home
we
have
a
announced
her
ladyship
and
do
not
disregard
it
i
am
very
sorry
faltered
the
culprit
that
is
enough
lucia
interrupted
lady
theobald
and
lucia
dropped
her
eyes
and
began
to
eat
her
soup
with
nervous
haste
in
fact
she
was
glad
to
escape
so
easily
she
was
a
very
pretty
creature
with
brown
eyes
a
soft
white
skin
and
a
slight
figure
with
a
grace
a
great
quantity
of
brown
hair
was
twisted
into
an
ugly
coil
on
the
top
of
her
delicate
little
head
and
she
wore
an
ugly
muslin
gown
of
miss
chickie
make
for
some
time
the
meal
progressed
in
dead
silence
but
at
length
lucia
ventured
to
raise
her
eyes
i
have
been
walking
in
slowbridge
grandmamma
she
said
and
i
met
burmistone
who
told
me
that
miss
bassett
has
a
visitor
a
young
lady
from
america
lady
theobald
laid
her
knife
and
fork
down
deliberately
mr
burmistone
she
said
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
you
stopped
on
the
roadside
to
converse
with
mr
burmistone
lucia
colored
up
to
her
delicate
eyebrows
and
above
them
i
was
trying
to
reach
a
flower
growing
on
the
bank
she
said
and
he
was
so
kind
as
to
stop
to
get
it
for
me
i
did
not
know
he
was
near
at
first
and
then
he
inquired
how
you
were
and
told
me
he
had
just
heard
about
the
young
lady
naturally
remarked
her
ladyship
sardonically
it
is
as
i
anticipated
it
would
be
we
shall
find
burmistone
at
our
elbows
upon
all
occasions
and
he
will
not
allow
himself
to
be
easily
driven
away
he
is
as
determined
as
persons
of
his
class
usually
are
o
grandmamma
protested
lucia
with
innocent
fervor
i
really
do
not
think
he
is
like
that
at
all
i
could
not
help
thinking
he
was
very
gentlemanly
and
kind
he
is
so
much
interested
in
your
school
and
so
anxious
that
it
should
prosper
may
i
ask
inquired
lady
theobald
how
long
a
time
this
generous
expression
of
his
sentiments
occupied
was
this
the
reason
of
your
forgetting
the
we
did
not
said
lucia
guiltily
it
did
not
take
many
minutes
i
i
do
not
think
that
made
me
late
lady
theobald
dismissed
this
paltry
excuse
with
one
remark
a
remark
made
in
the
deep
tones
referred
to
once
before
i
should
scarcely
have
expected
she
observed
that
a
granddaughter
of
mine
would
have
spent
half
an
hour
conversing
on
the
public
road
with
the
proprietor
of
slowbridge
mills
o
grandmamma
exclaimed
lucia
the
tears
rising
in
her
eyes
it
was
not
half
an
hour
i
should
scarcely
have
expected
replied
her
ladyship
that
a
granddaughter
of
mine
would
have
spent
five
minutes
conversing
on
the
public
road
with
the
proprietor
of
slowbridge
mills
to
this
assault
there
seemed
to
be
no
reply
to
make
lady
theobald
had
her
granddaughter
under
excellent
control
under
her
rigorous
rule
the
girl
whose
mother
had
died
at
her
birth
had
been
brought
up
at
nineteen
she
was
simple
sensitive
shy
she
had
been
permitted
to
have
no
companions
and
the
greatest
excitements
of
her
life
had
been
the
slowbridge
of
the
late
sir
gilbert
theobald
the
less
said
the
better
he
had
spent
very
little
of
his
married
life
at
oldclough
hall
and
upon
his
death
his
widow
had
found
herself
possessed
of
a
substantial
gloomy
mansion
an
exalted
position
in
slowbridge
society
and
a
small
upon
which
she
might
make
all
the
efforts
she
chose
to
sustain
her
state
so
lucia
wore
her
dresses
a
much
longer
time
than
any
other
slowbridge
young
lady
she
was
obliged
to
mend
her
little
gloves
again
and
again
and
her
hats
were
retrimmed
so
often
that
even
slowbridge
thought
them
but
she
was
too
simple
and
to
be
much
troubled
and
indeed
thought
very
little
about
the
matter
she
was
only
troubled
when
lady
theobald
scolded
her
which
was
by
no
means
infrequently
perhaps
the
straits
to
which
at
times
her
ladyship
was
put
to
maintain
her
dignity
imbittered
her
somewhat
lucia
is
neither
a
theobald
nor
a
barold
she
had
been
heard
to
say
once
and
she
had
said
it
with
much
rigor
a
subject
of
much
conversation
in
private
circles
had
been
future
it
had
been
discussed
in
whispers
since
her
seventeenth
year
but
no
one
had
seemed
to
approach
any
solution
of
the
difficulty
upon
the
subject
of
her
plans
for
her
granddaughter
lady
theobald
had
preserved
stern
silence
once
and
once
only
she
had
allowed
herself
to
be
betrayed
into
the
expression
of
a
sentiment
connected
with
the
matter
if
miss
lucia
marries
a
matron
of
reckless
proclivities
had
remarked
lady
theobald
turned
upon
her
slowly
and
majestically
miss
gaston
marries
she
repeated
does
it
seem
likely
that
miss
gaston
will
marry
this
settled
the
matter
finally
lucia
was
to
be
married
when
lady
theobald
thought
fit
so
far
however
she
had
not
thought
fit
indeed
there
had
been
nobody
for
lucia
to
marry
nobody
whom
her
grandmother
would
have
allowed
her
to
marry
at
least
there
were
very
few
young
men
in
slowbridge
and
the
very
few
were
scarcely
eligible
according
to
lady
theobald
standard
and
if
such
a
thing
should
be
mentioned
to
lucia
if
she
had
known
she
had
one
which
she
certainly
did
not
chapter
vi
accidental
when
dinner
was
over
lady
theobald
rose
and
proceeded
to
the
lucia
following
in
her
wake
from
her
very
babyhood
lucia
had
disliked
the
which
was
an
imposing
apartment
of
great
length
and
height
containing
much
massive
furniture
upholstered
in
faded
blue
satin
all
the
girl
evenings
since
her
fifth
year
had
been
spent
sitting
opposite
her
grandmother
in
one
of
the
straightest
of
the
blue
chairs
all
the
most
scathing
reproofs
she
had
received
had
been
administered
to
her
at
such
times
she
had
a
secret
theory
indeed
that
all
unpleasant
things
occurred
in
the
after
dinner
just
as
they
had
seated
themselves
and
lady
theobald
was
on
the
point
of
drawing
toward
her
the
little
basket
containing
the
gray
woollen
mittens
she
made
a
duty
of
employing
herself
by
knitting
each
evening
dobson
the
coachman
in
his
character
of
footman
threw
open
the
door
and
announced
a
visitor
capt
barold
lady
theobald
dropped
her
gray
mitten
the
steel
needles
falling
upon
the
table
with
a
clink
she
rose
to
her
feet
at
once
and
met
the
young
man
who
had
entered
my
dear
francis
she
remarked
i
am
exceedingly
glad
to
see
you
at
last
with
a
slight
emphasis
upon
the
at
last
said
capt
barold
rather
languidly
you
very
good
sure
then
he
glanced
at
lucia
and
lady
theobald
addressed
her
lucia
she
said
this
is
francis
barold
who
is
your
cousin
capt
barold
shook
hands
feebly
i
have
been
trying
to
find
out
whether
it
is
third
or
fourth
he
said
it
is
third
said
my
lady
lucia
had
never
seen
her
display
such
cordiality
to
anybody
but
capt
francis
barold
did
not
seem
much
impressed
by
it
it
struck
lucia
that
he
would
not
be
likely
to
be
impressed
by
any
thing
he
seated
himself
near
her
grandmother
chair
and
proceeded
to
explain
his
presence
on
the
spot
without
exhibiting
much
interest
even
in
his
own
relation
of
facts
i
promised
the
rathburns
that
i
would
spend
a
week
at
their
place
and
slowbridge
was
on
the
way
so
it
occurred
to
me
i
would
drop
off
in
passing
the
rathburns
place
broadoaks
is
about
ten
miles
farther
on
not
far
you
see
then
said
lady
theobald
i
am
to
understand
that
your
visit
is
accidental
capt
barold
was
not
embarrassed
he
did
not
attempt
to
avoid
her
ladyship
rather
stern
eye
as
he
made
his
cool
reply
well
yes
he
said
i
beg
pardon
but
it
is
accidental
rather
lucia
gave
him
a
pretty
frightened
look
as
if
she
felt
that
after
such
an
audacious
confession
something
very
serious
must
happen
but
nothing
serious
happened
at
all
singularly
enough
it
was
lady
theobald
herself
who
looked
ill
at
ease
and
as
though
she
had
not
been
prepared
for
such
a
contingency
during
the
whole
of
the
evening
in
fact
it
was
always
lady
theobald
who
was
placed
at
a
disadvantage
lucia
discovered
she
could
hardly
realize
the
fact
at
first
but
before
an
hour
had
passed
its
truth
was
forced
upon
her
capt
barold
was
a
very
man
upon
the
whole
he
was
large
gracefully
built
and
fair
his
eyes
were
gray
and
noticeable
for
the
coldness
of
their
expression
his
features
regular
and
aquiline
his
movements
leisurely
as
he
conversed
with
her
grandmother
lucia
wondered
at
him
privately
it
seemed
to
her
innocent
mind
that
he
had
been
everywhere
and
seen
every
thing
and
everybody
without
caring
for
or
enjoying
his
privileges
the
truth
was
that
he
had
seen
and
experienced
a
great
deal
too
much
as
an
only
child
the
heir
to
a
large
property
and
heir
prospective
to
one
of
the
oldest
titles
in
the
country
he
had
exhausted
life
early
he
saw
in
lady
theobald
not
the
imposing
head
and
social
front
of
slowbridge
social
life
the
power
who
rewarded
with
approval
and
punished
with
a
frown
but
a
tiresome
pretentious
old
woman
whom
his
mother
had
asked
him
for
some
feminine
reason
to
visit
she
feels
she
has
a
claim
upon
us
francis
she
had
said
appealingly
well
he
had
remarked
that
is
rather
deuced
cool
is
it
we
have
people
enough
on
our
hands
without
cultivating
slowbridge
you
know
his
mother
sighed
faintly
it
is
true
we
have
a
great
many
people
to
consider
but
i
wish
you
would
do
it
my
dear
she
did
not
say
any
thing
at
all
about
lucia
above
all
she
did
not
mention
that
a
year
ago
she
herself
had
spent
two
or
three
days
at
slowbridge
and
had
been
charmed
beyond
measure
by
the
girl
innocent
freshness
and
that
she
had
said
rather
absently
to
lady
theobald
what
a
charming
wife
lucia
would
make
for
a
man
to
whom
gentleness
and
a
yielding
disposition
were
necessary
we
do
not
find
such
girls
in
society
nowadays
my
dear
lady
theobald
it
is
very
difficult
of
late
years
to
find
a
girl
who
is
not
spoken
of
as
and
who
is
not
disposed
to
take
the
reins
in
her
own
hands
our
young
men
are
flattered
and
courted
until
they
become
a
little
dictatorial
and
our
girls
are
spoiled
at
home
and
the
result
is
a
great
deal
of
domestic
unhappiness
afterward
and
even
a
great
deal
of
scandal
which
is
dreadful
to
contemplate
i
can
not
help
feeling
the
greatest
anxiety
in
secret
concerning
francis
young
men
so
seldom
consider
these
matters
until
it
is
too
late
girls
are
not
trained
as
they
were
in
my
young
days
or
even
in
yours
said
lady
theobald
they
are
allowed
too
much
liberty
lucia
has
been
brought
up
immediately
under
my
own
eye
i
feel
that
it
is
fortunate
remarked
barold
quite
incidentally
that
francis
need
not
make
a
point
of
money
for
a
few
moments
lady
theobald
did
not
respond
but
afterward
in
the
course
of
the
conversation
which
followed
she
made
an
observation
which
was
of
course
purely
incidental
if
lucia
makes
a
marriage
which
pleases
her
old
dugald
binnie
of
glasgow
she
will
be
a
very
fortunate
girl
he
has
intimated
in
his
eccentric
fashion
that
his
immense
fortune
will
either
be
hers
or
will
be
spent
in
building
charitable
asylums
of
various
kinds
he
is
a
remarkable
and
singular
man
when
capt
barold
had
entered
his
distinguished
relative
he
had
not
regarded
his
third
cousin
with
a
very
great
deal
of
interest
he
had
seen
too
many
beauties
in
his
thirty
years
to
be
greatly
moved
by
the
sight
of
one
and
here
was
only
a
girl
who
had
soft
eyes
and
looked
young
for
her
age
and
who
wore
an
ugly
muslin
gown
that
most
girls
could
not
have
carried
off
at
all
you
have
spent
the
greater
part
of
your
life
in
slowbridge
he
condescended
to
say
in
the
course
of
the
evening
i
have
lived
here
always
lucia
answered
i
have
never
been
away
more
than
a
week
at
a
time
ah
interrogatively
i
hope
you
have
not
found
it
dull
no
smiling
a
little
not
very
you
see
i
have
known
nothing
gayer
there
is
society
enough
of
a
harmless
kind
here
spoke
up
lady
theobald
virtuously
i
do
not
approve
of
a
round
of
gayeties
for
young
people
it
unfits
them
for
the
duties
of
life
but
capt
barold
was
not
as
favorably
impressed
by
these
remarks
as
might
have
been
anticipated
what
an
old
fool
she
is
was
his
polite
inward
comment
and
he
resolved
at
once
to
make
his
visit
as
brief
as
possible
and
not
to
be
induced
to
run
down
again
during
his
stay
at
broadoaks
he
did
not
even
take
the
trouble
to
appear
to
enjoy
his
evening
from
his
earliest
infancy
he
had
always
found
it
easier
to
please
himself
than
to
please
other
people
in
fact
the
world
had
devoted
itself
to
endeavoring
to
please
him
and
win
his
toleration
we
may
say
instead
of
admiration
since
it
could
not
hope
for
the
latter
at
home
he
had
been
adored
rapturously
by
a
large
circle
of
affectionate
male
and
female
relatives
at
school
his
tutors
had
been
singularly
indulgent
of
his
faults
and
admiring
of
his
talents
even
among
his
he
had
been
a
sort
of
autocrat
why
not
indeed
with
such
birthrights
and
such
prospects
when
he
had
entered
society
he
had
met
with
even
more
amiable
treatment
from
affectionate
mothers
from
innocent
daughters
from
cordial
paternal
parents
who
voted
him
an
exceedingly
fine
fellow
why
should
he
bore
himself
by
taking
the
trouble
to
seem
pleased
by
a
stupid
evening
with
an
old
grenadier
in
petticoats
and
a
badly
dressed
country
girl
lucia
was
very
glad
when
in
answer
to
a
timidly
appealing
glance
lady
theobald
said
it
is
ten
you
may
wish
us
lucia
lucia
obeyed
as
if
she
had
been
ten
herself
instead
of
nearly
twenty
and
barold
was
not
long
in
following
her
example
dobson
led
him
to
a
stately
chamber
at
the
top
of
the
staircase
and
left
him
there
the
captain
chose
the
largest
and
most
luxurious
chair
sat
down
in
it
and
lighted
a
cigar
at
his
leisure
confoundedly
stupid
hole
he
said
with
a
refined
vigor
one
would
scarcely
have
expected
from
an
individual
of
his
birth
and
breeding
i
shall
leave
of
course
what
was
my
mother
thinking
of
stupid
business
from
first
to
last
chapter
vii
i
should
like
to
see
more
of
slowbridge
when
he
announced
at
breakfast
his
intention
of
taking
his
departure
on
the
midday
train
lucia
wondered
again
what
would
happen
and
again
to
her
relief
lady
theobald
was
astonishingly
lenient
as
your
friends
expect
you
of
course
we
can
not
overrule
them
she
said
we
will
however
hope
to
see
something
of
you
during
your
stay
at
broadoaks
it
will
be
very
easy
for
you
to
run
down
and
give
us
a
few
hours
now
and
then
said
capt
barold
he
was
decently
civil
if
not
enthusiastic
during
the
few
remaining
hours
of
his
stay
he
sauntered
through
the
grounds
with
lucia
who
took
charge
of
him
in
obedience
to
her
grandmother
wish
he
did
not
find
her
particularly
troublesome
when
she
was
away
from
her
ladyship
side
when
she
came
out
to
him
in
her
simple
cotton
gown
and
straw
hat
it
occurred
to
him
that
she
was
much
prettier
than
he
had
thought
her
at
first
for
economical
reasons
she
had
made
the
little
herself
without
the
slightest
regard
for
the
designs
of
miss
chickie
and
as
it
was
not
trimmed
at
all
and
had
only
a
ribbon
at
the
waist
there
was
nothing
to
place
her
charming
figure
at
a
disadvantage
it
could
not
be
said
that
her
shyness
and
simplicity
delighted
capt
barold
but
at
least
they
did
not
displease
him
and
this
was
really
as
much
as
could
be
expected
she
does
not
expect
a
fellow
to
exert
himself
at
all
events
was
his
inward
comment
and
he
did
not
exert
himself
but
when
on
the
point
of
taking
his
departure
he
went
so
far
as
to
make
a
very
gracious
remark
to
her
i
hope
we
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
in
london
for
a
season
before
very
long
he
said
my
mother
will
have
great
pleasure
in
taking
charge
of
you
if
lady
theobald
can
not
be
induced
to
leave
slowbridge
lucia
never
goes
from
home
alone
said
lady
theobald
but
i
should
certainly
be
obliged
to
call
upon
your
mother
for
her
good
offices
in
the
case
of
our
spending
a
season
in
london
i
am
too
old
a
woman
to
alter
my
mode
of
life
altogether
in
obedience
to
her
ladyship
orders
the
venerable
landau
was
brought
to
the
door
and
the
two
ladies
drove
to
the
station
with
him
it
was
during
this
drive
that
a
very
curious
incident
occurred
an
incident
to
which
perhaps
this
story
owes
its
existence
since
if
it
had
not
taken
place
there
might
very
possibly
have
been
no
events
of
a
stirring
nature
to
chronicle
just
as
dobson
drove
rather
slowly
up
the
part
of
high
street
distinguished
by
the
presence
of
miss
belinda
bassett
house
capt
barold
suddenly
appeared
to
be
attracted
by
some
figure
he
discovered
in
the
garden
appertaining
to
that
modest
structure
by
jove
he
exclaimed
in
an
undertone
there
is
miss
octavia
for
the
moment
he
was
almost
roused
to
a
display
of
interest
a
faint
smile
lighted
his
face
and
his
cold
handsome
eyes
slightly
brightened
lady
theobald
sat
bolt
upright
that
is
miss
bassett
niece
from
america
she
said
do
i
understand
you
know
her
capt
barold
turned
to
confront
her
evidently
annoyed
at
having
allowed
a
surprise
to
get
the
better
of
him
all
expression
died
out
of
his
face
i
travelled
with
her
from
framwich
to
stamford
he
said
i
suppose
we
should
have
reached
slowbridge
together
but
that
i
dropped
off
at
stamford
to
get
a
newspaper
and
the
train
left
me
behind
o
grandmamma
exclaimed
lucia
who
had
turned
to
look
how
very
pretty
she
is
miss
octavia
certainly
was
amazingly
so
this
morning
she
was
standing
by
a
rosebush
again
and
was
dressed
in
a
cashmere
of
the
finest
texture
and
the
faintest
pink
it
had
a
watteau
plait
down
the
back
of
lace
down
the
front
and
the
close
high
frills
of
lace
around
the
throat
which
seemed
to
be
a
weakness
with
her
her
hair
was
dressed
high
upon
her
head
and
showed
to
advantage
her
little
ears
and
as
much
of
her
slim
white
neck
as
the
frills
did
not
conceal
but
lady
theobald
did
not
share
lucia
enthusiasm
she
looks
like
an
actress
she
said
if
the
trees
were
painted
canvas
and
the
roses
artificial
one
might
have
some
patience
with
her
that
kind
of
thing
is
scarcely
what
we
expect
in
slowbridge
then
she
turned
to
barold
i
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
her
yesterday
not
long
after
she
arrived
she
said
she
had
diamonds
in
her
ears
as
big
as
peas
and
rings
to
match
her
manner
is
just
what
one
might
expect
from
a
young
woman
brought
up
among
and
it
struck
me
as
being
a
very
unique
and
interesting
manner
said
capt
barold
it
is
chiefly
noticeable
for
a
which
might
be
regarded
as
rather
enviable
she
was
good
enough
to
tell
me
all
about
her
papa
and
the
and
i
really
found
the
conversation
entertaining
it
is
scarcely
customary
for
english
young
women
to
confide
in
their
masculine
travelling
companions
to
such
an
extent
remarked
my
lady
grimly
she
did
not
confide
in
me
at
all
said
barold
therein
lay
her
attraction
one
can
not
submit
to
being
in
by
a
strange
young
woman
however
charming
this
young
lady
remarks
were
flavored
solely
with
an
adorably
cool
candor
she
evidently
did
not
desire
to
appeal
to
any
emotion
whatever
and
as
he
leaned
back
in
his
seat
he
still
looked
at
the
picturesque
figure
which
they
had
passed
as
if
he
would
not
have
been
sorry
to
see
it
turn
its
head
toward
him
in
fact
it
seemed
that
notwithstanding
his
usual
good
fortune
capt
barold
was
doomed
this
morning
to
make
remarks
of
a
nature
objectionable
to
his
revered
relation
on
their
way
they
passed
burmistone
mill
which
was
at
work
in
all
its
vigor
with
a
whir
and
buzz
of
machinery
and
a
slight
odor
of
oil
in
its
surrounding
atmosphere
ah
said
barold
putting
his
single
eyeglass
into
his
eye
and
scanning
it
after
the
manner
of
experts
i
did
not
think
you
had
any
thing
of
that
sort
here
who
put
it
up
the
man
name
replied
lady
theobald
severely
is
burmistone
pretty
good
idea
is
it
remarked
barold
good
for
the
place
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
to
my
mind
answered
my
lady
it
is
the
worst
possible
thing
which
could
have
happened
francis
barold
dropped
his
eyeglass
dexterously
and
at
once
lapsed
into
his
normal
condition
which
was
a
condition
by
no
means
favorable
to
argument
think
so
he
said
slowly
pity
is
it
under
the
circumstances
and
really
there
was
nothing
at
all
for
her
ladyship
to
do
but
preserve
a
lofty
silence
she
had
scarcely
recovered
herself
when
they
reached
the
station
and
it
was
necessary
to
say
farewell
as
complacently
as
possible
we
will
hope
to
see
you
again
before
many
days
she
said
with
dignity
if
not
with
warmth
francis
barold
was
silent
for
a
second
and
a
slightly
reflective
expression
flitted
across
his
face
thanks
yes
he
said
at
last
certainly
it
is
easy
to
come
down
and
i
should
like
to
see
more
of
slowbridge
when
the
train
had
puffed
in
and
out
of
the
station
and
dobson
was
driving
down
high
street
again
her
ladyship
feelings
rather
got
the
better
of
her
if
belinda
bassett
is
a
wise
woman
she
remarked
she
will
take
my
advice
and
get
rid
of
this
young
lady
as
soon
as
possible
it
appears
to
me
she
continued
with
exalted
piety
that
every
english
girl
has
reason
to
thank
her
maker
that
she
was
born
in
a
civilized
land
perhaps
suggested
lucia
softly
miss
octavia
bassett
has
had
no
one
to
train
her
at
all
and
it
may
be
that
that
she
even
feels
it
deeply
the
feathers
in
her
ladyship
bonnet
trembled
she
does
not
feel
it
at
all
she
announced
she
is
an
impertinent
minx
chapter
viii
shares
looking
up
there
were
others
who
echoed
her
ladyship
words
afterward
though
they
echoed
them
privately
and
with
more
caution
than
my
lady
felt
necessary
it
is
certain
that
miss
octavia
bassett
did
not
improve
as
time
progressed
and
she
had
enlarged
opportunities
for
studying
the
noble
example
set
before
her
by
slowbridge
on
his
arrival
in
new
york
martin
bassett
telegraphed
to
his
daughter
and
sister
per
atlantic
cable
informing
them
that
he
might
be
detained
a
couple
of
months
and
bidding
them
to
be
of
good
cheer
the
arrival
of
the
message
in
its
official
envelope
so
alarmed
miss
belinda
that
she
was
supported
by
mary
anne
while
it
was
read
to
her
by
octavia
who
received
it
without
any
surprise
whatever
for
some
time
after
its
completion
slowbridge
had
privately
disbelieved
in
the
atlantic
cable
and
until
this
occasion
had
certainly
disbelieved
in
the
existence
of
people
who
received
messages
through
it
in
fact
on
first
finding
that
she
was
the
recipient
of
such
a
message
miss
belinda
had
made
immediate
preparations
for
fainting
quietly
away
being
fully
convinced
that
a
shipwreck
had
occurred
which
had
resulted
in
her
brother
death
and
that
his
executors
had
chosen
this
delicate
method
of
breaking
the
news
a
message
by
atlantic
cable
she
had
gasped
do
do
read
it
my
love
some
one
else
do
that
poor
poor
child
trust
in
providence
my
love
and
and
bear
up
ah
how
i
wish
i
had
a
stronger
mind
and
could
be
of
more
service
to
you
it
a
message
from
father
said
octavia
nothing
is
the
matter
all
right
he
got
in
on
saturday
ah
panted
miss
belinda
are
you
sure
my
dear
are
you
quite
sure
that
what
he
says
listen
got
in
saturday
piper
met
me
shares
looking
up
may
be
kept
here
two
months
will
write
keep
up
your
spirits
martin
bassett
thank
heaven
sighed
miss
belinda
thank
heaven
why
said
octavia
why
echoed
miss
belinda
ah
my
dear
if
you
knew
how
terrified
i
was
i
felt
sure
that
something
had
happened
a
message
my
dear
i
never
received
a
telegram
in
my
life
before
and
to
receive
a
message
was
really
a
well
i
do
see
why
said
octavia
it
seems
to
me
it
is
pretty
much
like
any
other
message
miss
belinda
regarded
her
timidly
does
your
papa
send
them
she
inquired
surely
it
must
be
expensive
i
do
suppose
it
cheap
octavia
replied
but
it
saves
time
and
worry
i
should
have
had
to
wait
twelve
days
for
a
letter
very
true
said
miss
belinda
but
she
broke
off
with
rather
a
distressed
shake
of
the
head
her
simple
ideas
of
economy
and
quiet
living
were
frequently
upset
in
these
times
she
had
begun
to
regard
her
niece
with
a
slight
feeling
of
awe
and
yet
octavia
had
not
been
doing
any
thing
at
all
remarkable
in
her
own
eyes
and
considered
her
life
pretty
dull
if
the
elder
miss
bassett
her
parents
and
grandparents
had
not
been
so
thoroughly
well
known
and
so
universally
respected
if
their
social
position
had
not
been
so
firmly
established
and
their
quiet
lives
not
quite
so
highly
respectable
there
is
an
awful
possibility
that
slowbridge
might
even
have
gone
so
far
as
not
to
ask
octavia
out
to
tea
at
all
but
even
lady
theobald
felt
that
it
would
not
do
to
slight
belinda
bassett
niece
and
guest
to
omit
the
customary
state
teas
would
have
been
to
crush
innocent
miss
belinda
at
a
blow
and
place
her
through
the
medium
of
this
young
lady
who
alone
deserved
condemnation
beyond
the
pale
of
all
social
law
it
is
only
to
be
regretted
said
her
ladyship
that
belinda
bassett
has
not
arranged
things
better
relatives
of
such
an
order
are
certainly
to
be
deplored
in
secret
lucia
felt
much
sympathy
for
both
miss
bassett
and
her
guest
she
could
not
help
wondering
how
miss
belinda
became
responsible
for
the
calamity
which
had
fallen
upon
her
it
really
did
not
seem
probable
that
she
had
been
previously
consulted
as
to
the
kind
of
niece
she
desired
or
that
she
had
in
a
distinct
manner
evinced
a
preference
for
a
niece
of
this
description
perhaps
dear
grandmamma
the
girl
ventured
it
is
because
miss
octavia
bassett
is
so
young
that
may
i
ask
inquired
lady
theobald
in
fell
tones
how
old
you
are
i
was
nineteen
in
in
december
miss
octavia
bassett
said
her
ladyship
was
nineteen
last
october
and
it
is
now
june
i
have
not
yet
found
it
necessary
to
apologize
for
you
on
the
score
of
youth
but
it
was
her
ladyship
who
took
the
initiative
and
set
an
evening
for
entertaining
miss
belinda
and
her
niece
in
company
with
several
other
ladies
with
the
best
bohea
thin
bread
and
butter
and
various
other
delicacies
what
do
they
do
at
such
places
asked
octavia
five
is
pretty
early
we
spend
some
time
at
the
my
dear
explained
miss
belinda
and
afterward
we
we
converse
a
few
of
us
play
whist
i
do
not
i
feel
as
if
i
were
not
clever
enough
and
i
get
flurried
too
easily
by
by
differences
of
opinion
i
should
think
it
was
very
exciting
said
octavia
i
do
fancy
i
ever
went
to
an
entertainment
where
they
did
nothing
but
drink
tea
and
talk
it
is
not
our
intention
or
desire
to
be
exciting
my
dear
miss
belinda
replied
with
mild
dignity
and
an
improving
conversation
is
frequently
most
beneficial
to
the
parties
engaged
in
it
i
afraid
octavia
observed
that
i
never
heard
much
improving
conversation
she
was
really
no
fonder
of
masculine
society
than
the
generality
of
girls
but
she
could
not
help
wondering
if
there
would
be
any
young
men
present
and
if
indeed
there
were
any
young
men
in
slowbridge
who
might
possibly
be
produced
upon
festive
occasions
even
though
ordinarily
kept
in
the
background
she
had
not
heard
miss
belinda
mention
any
masculine
name
so
far
but
that
of
the
curate
of
james
and
when
she
had
seen
him
pass
the
house
she
had
not
found
his
slim
black
figure
and
faint
ecclesiastic
whiskers
especially
interesting
it
must
be
confessed
that
miss
belinda
suffered
many
pangs
of
anxiety
in
looking
forward
to
her
young
kinswoman
first
appearance
in
society
a
tea
at
lady
theobald
house
constituted
formal
presentation
to
the
slowbridge
world
each
young
lady
within
the
pale
of
genteel
society
having
arrived
at
years
of
discretion
on
returning
home
from
was
invited
to
tea
at
oldclough
hall
during
an
entire
evening
she
was
the
subject
of
watchful
criticism
her
deportment
was
remarked
her
accomplishments
displayed
she
performed
her
last
new
pieces
upon
the
piano
she
was
drawn
into
conversation
by
her
hostess
and
upon
the
timid
modesty
of
her
replies
and
the
reverence
of
her
listening
attitudes
depended
her
future
social
status
so
it
was
very
natural
indeed
that
miss
belinda
should
be
anxious
i
would
wear
something
rather
quiet
and
and
simple
my
dear
octavia
she
said
a
white
muslin
perhaps
with
blue
ribbons
would
you
answered
octavia
then
after
appearing
to
reflect
upon
the
matter
a
few
seconds
i
got
one
that
would
do
if
it
warm
enough
to
wear
it
i
bought
it
in
new
york
but
it
came
from
paris
i
never
worn
it
yet
it
would
be
nicer
than
any
thing
else
my
love
said
miss
belinda
delighted
to
find
her
difficulty
so
easily
disposed
of
nothing
is
so
charming
in
the
dress
of
a
young
girl
as
pure
simplicity
our
slowbridge
young
ladies
rarely
wear
any
thing
but
white
for
evening
miss
chickie
assured
me
a
few
weeks
ago
that
she
had
made
fifteen
dresses
all
after
one
simple
design
of
her
own
i
should
think
that
was
particularly
nice
myself
remarked
octavia
impartially
i
should
be
glad
one
of
the
fifteen
did
belong
to
me
i
should
feel
as
if
people
might
say
when
i
came
into
a
room
gracious
there
another
the
first
was
made
for
miss
lucia
gaston
who
is
lady
theobald
niece
replied
miss
belinda
mildly
and
there
are
few
young
ladies
in
slowbridge
who
would
not
emulate
her
example
oh
said
octavia
i
dare
say
she
is
very
nice
and
all
that
but
i
do
believe
i
should
care
to
copy
her
dresses
i
think
i
should
draw
the
line
there
but
she
said
it
without
any
and
sensitive
as
miss
belinda
was
upon
the
subject
of
her
cherished
ideals
she
could
not
take
offence
when
the
eventful
evening
arrived
there
was
excitement
in
more
than
one
establishment
upon
high
street
and
the
streets
in
its
vicinity
the
stories
of
the
diamonds
the
and
the
had
been
added
to
and
embellished
in
the
most
ornate
and
startling
manner
it
was
well
known
that
only
lady
theobald
fine
appreciation
of
miss
belinda
bassett
feelings
had
induced
her
to
extend
her
hospitalities
to
that
lady
niece
i
would
prefer
my
dear
said
more
than
one
discreet
matron
to
her
daughter
as
they
attired
themselves
i
would
much
prefer
that
you
would
remain
near
me
during
the
earlier
part
of
the
evening
before
we
know
how
this
young
lady
may
turn
out
let
your
manner
toward
her
be
kind
but
not
familiar
it
is
well
to
be
upon
the
safe
side
what
precise
line
of
conduct
it
was
generally
anticipated
that
this
and
young
person
would
adopt
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
it
is
sufficient
that
the
general
sentiments
regarding
her
were
of
a
distrustful
if
not
timorous
nature
to
miss
bassett
who
felt
all
this
in
the
very
air
she
breathed
the
girl
innocence
of
the
condition
of
affairs
was
even
a
little
touching
with
all
her
splendor
she
was
not
at
all
hard
to
please
and
had
quite
awakened
to
an
interest
in
the
impending
social
event
she
seemed
in
good
spirits
and
talked
more
than
was
her
custom
giving
miss
belinda
graphic
descriptions
of
various
festal
gatherings
she
had
attended
in
new
york
when
she
seemed
to
have
been
very
gay
indeed
and
to
have
worn
very
beautiful
dresses
and
also
to
have
had
rather
more
than
her
share
of
partners
the
phrases
she
used
and
the
dances
she
described
were
all
strange
to
miss
belinda
and
tended
to
reducing
her
to
a
bewildered
condition
in
which
she
felt
much
timid
amazement
at
the
intrepidity
of
the
young
ladies
and
no
slight
suspicion
of
the
german
as
a
theatrical
kind
of
dance
involving
extraordinary
figures
and
an
extraordinary
amount
of
attention
from
partners
of
the
stronger
sex
it
must
be
admitted
however
that
by
this
time
notwithstanding
the
various
shocks
she
had
received
miss
belinda
had
begun
to
discover
in
her
young
guest
divers
good
qualities
which
appealed
to
her
affectionate
and
susceptible
old
heart
in
the
first
place
the
girl
had
no
small
affectations
indeed
if
she
had
been
less
unaffected
she
might
have
been
less
subject
to
severe
comment
she
was
and
generous
to
extravagance
her
manner
toward
mary
anne
never
ceased
to
arouse
miss
belinda
to
interest
there
was
not
any
condescension
whatever
in
it
and
yet
it
could
not
be
called
a
vulgarly
familiar
manner
it
was
rather
an
astonishingly
simple
manner
somehow
suggestive
of
a
subtile
recognition
of
mary
anne
youth
and
in
not
having
before
her
more
lively
prospects
she
gave
mary
anne
presents
in
the
shape
of
articles
of
clothing
at
which
slowbridge
would
have
exclaimed
in
horror
if
the
recipient
had
dared
to
wear
them
but
when
miss
belinda
expressed
her
regret
at
these
indiscretions
octavia
was
quite
willing
to
rectify
her
mistakes
ah
well
she
said
i
can
give
her
some
money
and
she
can
buy
some
things
for
herself
which
she
proceeded
to
do
and
when
under
her
mistress
direction
mary
anne
purchased
a
stout
brown
merino
she
took
quite
an
interest
in
her
struggles
at
making
it
i
would
make
it
so
short
in
the
waist
and
so
full
in
the
skirt
if
i
were
you
she
said
there
no
reason
why
it
should
fit
you
know
thereby
winning
the
undying
adoration
and
adding
much
to
the
shapeliness
of
the
garment
i
am
sure
she
has
a
good
heart
miss
belinda
said
to
herself
as
the
days
went
by
she
is
like
martin
in
that
i
dare
say
she
finds
me
very
ignorant
and
silly
i
often
see
in
her
face
that
she
is
unable
to
understand
my
feeling
about
things
but
she
never
seems
to
laugh
at
me
nor
think
of
me
unkindly
and
she
is
very
very
pretty
though
perhaps
i
ought
not
to
think
of
that
at
all
chapter
ix
white
muslin
as
the
good
little
spinster
was
arraying
herself
on
this
particular
evening
having
laid
upon
the
bed
the
greater
portion
of
her
modest
splendor
she
went
to
her
wardrobe
and
took
therefrom
the
scored
bandbox
containing
her
best
cap
all
the
ladies
of
slowbridge
wore
caps
and
all
being
respectfully
plagiarized
from
lady
theobald
without
any
reference
to
age
size
complexion
or
demeanor
the
result
was
sometimes
a
little
trying
lady
theobald
were
of
a
severe
and
bristling
order
the
lace
of
which
they
were
composed
was
induced
by
some
ingenious
device
to
form
itself
into
aggressive
quillings
the
bows
seemed
lined
with
buckram
the
strings
neither
floated
nor
fluttered
to
a
majestic
person
the
style
is
very
appropriate
miss
belinda
had
said
to
octavia
that
very
day
but
to
one
who
is
not
so
it
is
rather
trying
sometimes
indeed
i
have
wished
that
miss
chickie
would
vary
a
more
in
her
designs
perhaps
the
sight
of
the
various
articles
contained
in
two
of
the
five
trunks
had
inspired
these
doubts
in
the
dear
old
lady
breast
it
is
certain
at
least
that
as
she
took
the
best
cap
up
a
faint
sigh
fluttered
upon
her
lips
it
is
very
large
for
a
small
person
she
said
and
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
amber
is
becoming
to
me
and
just
at
that
moment
there
came
a
tap
at
the
door
which
she
knew
was
from
octavia
she
laid
the
cap
back
in
some
confusion
at
being
surprised
in
a
moment
of
weakness
come
in
my
love
she
said
octavia
pushed
the
door
open
and
came
in
she
had
not
dressed
yet
and
had
on
her
wrapper
and
slippers
which
were
both
of
quilted
gray
silk
gayly
embroidered
with
carnations
but
miss
belinda
had
seen
both
wrapper
and
slippers
before
and
had
become
used
to
their
sumptuousness
what
she
had
not
seen
was
the
trifle
the
girl
held
in
her
hand
see
here
she
said
see
what
i
have
been
making
for
you
she
looked
quite
elated
and
laughed
triumphantly
i
did
not
know
i
could
do
it
until
i
tried
she
said
i
had
seen
some
in
new
york
and
i
had
the
lace
by
me
and
i
have
enough
left
to
make
ruffles
for
your
neck
and
wrists
it
mechlin
my
dear
exclaimed
miss
belinda
my
dear
octavia
laughed
again
do
you
know
what
it
is
she
said
it
is
like
a
slowbridge
cap
but
it
a
cap
nevertheless
they
wear
them
like
this
in
new
york
and
i
think
they
are
ever
so
much
prettier
it
was
true
that
it
was
not
like
a
slowbridge
cap
and
was
also
true
that
it
was
prettier
it
was
a
delicate
affair
of
softly
quilled
lace
adorned
here
and
there
with
loops
of
pale
satin
ribbon
let
me
try
it
on
said
octavia
advancing
and
in
a
minute
she
had
done
so
and
turned
miss
bassett
about
to
face
herself
in
the
glass
there
she
said
is
that
better
than
well
than
emulating
lady
theobald
it
was
so
pretty
and
so
becoming
and
miss
belinda
was
so
touched
by
the
girl
innocent
enjoyment
that
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
my
my
love
she
faltered
it
is
so
beautiful
and
so
expensive
that
though
indeed
i
do
know
how
to
thank
you
i
am
afraid
i
should
not
dare
to
wear
it
oh
answered
octavia
that
nonsense
you
know
i
sure
there
no
reason
why
people
should
wear
becoming
things
besides
i
should
be
awfully
disappointed
i
did
think
i
could
make
it
and
i
real
proud
of
it
you
do
know
how
becoming
it
is
miss
belinda
looked
at
her
reflection
and
faltered
it
was
becoming
my
love
she
protested
faintly
real
mechlin
there
is
really
no
such
lace
in
slowbridge
all
the
better
said
octavia
cheerfully
i
glad
to
hear
that
it
is
one
bit
too
nice
for
you
to
miss
belinda
astonishment
she
drew
a
step
nearer
to
her
and
gave
one
of
the
satin
loops
a
queer
caressing
little
touch
which
actually
seemed
to
mean
something
and
then
suddenly
the
girl
stooped
with
a
little
laugh
and
gave
her
aunt
a
light
kiss
on
her
cheek
there
she
said
you
must
take
it
from
me
for
a
present
i
go
and
make
the
ruffles
this
minute
and
you
must
wear
those
too
and
let
people
see
how
stylish
you
can
be
and
without
giving
miss
bassett
time
to
speak
she
ran
out
of
the
room
and
left
the
dear
old
lady
warmed
to
the
heart
tearful
delighted
frightened
a
coach
from
the
blue
lion
had
been
ordered
to
present
itself
at
a
quarter
past
five
promptly
and
at
the
time
specified
it
rattled
up
to
the
door
with
much
spirit
with
so
much
spirit
indeed
that
miss
belinda
was
a
little
alarmed
dear
dear
she
said
i
hope
the
driver
will
be
able
to
control
the
horse
and
will
not
allow
him
to
go
too
fast
one
hears
of
such
terrible
accidents
then
mary
anne
was
sent
to
announce
the
arrival
of
the
equipage
to
miss
octavia
and
having
performed
the
errand
came
back
beaming
with
smiles
oh
mum
she
exclaimed
you
never
see
nothin
like
her
her
gownd
is
an
lor
how
you
do
look
yourself
to
be
sure
indeed
the
lace
ruffles
on
her
best
black
silk
and
the
little
cap
on
her
smooth
hair
had
done
a
great
deal
for
miss
bassett
and
she
had
only
just
been
reproaching
herself
for
her
vanity
in
recognizing
this
fact
but
mary
anne
words
awakened
a
new
train
of
thought
is
is
miss
octavia
dress
a
showy
one
mary
anne
she
inquired
dear
me
i
do
hope
it
is
not
a
showy
dress
i
never
see
nothin
no
eleganter
mum
said

she
wants
nothin
but
a
veil
to
make
a
bride
out
of
her
an
a
becominer
thing
she
never
has
wore
they
heard
the
soft
sweep
of
skirts
at
that
moment
and
octavia
came
in
there
she
said
stopping
when
she
had
reached
the
middle
of
the
room
is
that
simple
enough
miss
belinda
could
only
look
at
her
helplessly
the
white
muslin
was
composed
almost
entirely
of
valenciennes
lace
the
blue
ribbons
were
embroidered
with
the
air
of
delicate
elaborateness
about
the
whole
was
something
which
her
innocent
mind
could
not
have
believed
possible
in
orthodox
white
and
blue
i
do
think
i
should
call
it
exactly
simple
she
said
my
love
what
a
quantity
of
lace
octavia
glanced
down
at
her
and
frills
complacently
there
a
good
deal
of
it
she
remarked
but
then
it
is
nice
and
one
can
stand
a
good
deal
of
nice
valenciennes
on
white
they
said
worth
made
the
dress
i
hope
he
did
it
cost
enough
the
ribbon
was
embroidered
by
hand
i
suppose
and
there
is
plenty
of
it
cut
up
into
these
bows
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
miss
belinda
led
the
way
to
the
coach
which
they
entered
under
the
admiring
or
critical
eyes
of
several
most
respectable
families
who
had
been
lying
in
wait
behind
their
since
they
had
been
summoned
there
by
the
sound
of
the
wheels
as
the
vehicle
rattled
past
the
all
the
young
ladies
in
the
first
class
rushed
to
the
window
they
were
rewarded
for
their
zeal
by
a
glimpse
of
a
cloud
of
muslin
and
lace
a
charmingly
dressed
head
and
a
pretty
face
whose
eyes
favored
them
with
a
frank
stare
of
interest
she
had
diamonds
in
her
ears
cried
miss
phipps
wildly
excited
i
saw
them
flash
ah
how
i
should
like
to
see
her
without
her
wraps
i
have
no
doubt
she
is
a
perfect
blaze
chapter
x
announcing
barold
lady
theobald
invited
guests
sat
in
the
faded
blue
waiting
everybody
had
been
unusually
prompt
perhaps
because
everybody
wished
to
be
on
the
ground
in
time
to
see
miss
octavia
bassett
make
her
entrance
i
should
think
it
would
be
rather
a
trial
even
to
such
a
girl
as
she
is
said
to
be
remarked
one
matron
it
is
but
natural
that
she
should
feel
that
lady
theobald
will
regard
her
rather
critically
and
that
she
should
know
that
american
manners
will
hardly
be
the
thing
for
a
genteel
and
conservative
english
country
town
we
saw
her
a
few
days
ago
said
lucia
who
chanced
to
hear
this
speech
and
she
is
very
pretty
i
think
i
never
saw
any
one
so
very
pretty
before
but
in
quite
a
theatrical
way
i
think
my
dear
the
matron
replied
in
a
tone
of
gentle
correction
i
have
seen
so
very
few
theatrical
people
lucia
answered
sweetly
that
i
scarcely
know
what
the
theatrical
way
is
dear
burnham
her
dress
was
very
beautiful
and
not
like
what
we
wear
in
slowbridge
but
she
seemed
to
me
to
be
very
bright
and
pretty
in
a
way
quite
new
to
me
and
so
just
a
little
odd
i
have
heard
that
her
dress
is
most
extravagant
and
wasteful
put
in
miss
pilcher
whose
educational
position
entitled
her
to
the
condescending
respect
of
her
patronesses
she
has
lace
on
her
morning
gowns
which
miss
bassett
and
miss
octavia
bassett
announced
dobson
throwing
open
the
door
lady
theobald
rose
from
her
seat
a
slight
rustle
made
itself
heard
through
the
company
as
the
ladies
all
turned
toward
the
entrance
and
after
they
had
so
turned
there
were
evidences
of
a
positive
thrill
before
the
eyes
of
all
belinda
bassett
advanced
with
rich
ruffles
of
mechlin
at
her
neck
and
wrists
with
a
delicate
and
distinctly
novel
cap
upon
her
head
her
niece
following
her
with
an
unabashed
face
twenty
pounds
worth
of
lace
on
her
dress
and
unmistakable
diamonds
in
her
little
ears
there
is
not
a
of
timidity
about
her
cried
burnham
under
her
breath
this
is
actual
boldness
but
this
was
a
very
severe
term
to
use
notwithstanding
that
it
was
born
of
righteous
indignation
it
was
not
boldness
at
all
it
was
only
the
serenity
of
a
young
person
who
was
quite
unconscious
that
there
was
any
thing
to
fear
in
the
rather
unimposing
party
before
her
octavia
was
accustomed
to
entering
rooms
full
of
strangers
she
had
spent
several
years
of
her
life
in
hotels
where
she
had
been
stared
out
of
countenance
by
a
few
score
new
people
every
day
she
was
even
used
to
being
in
some
sort
a
young
person
of
note
it
was
nothing
unusual
for
her
to
know
that
she
was
being
pointed
out
that
pretty
blonde
she
often
heard
it
said
is
martin
bassett
daughter
sharp
fellow
bassett
and
lucky
fellow
too
more
money
than
he
can
count
so
she
was
not
at
all
frightened
when
she
walked
in
behind
miss
belinda
she
glanced
about
her
cheerfully
and
catching
sight
of
lucia
smiled
at
her
as
she
advanced
up
the
room
the
call
of
state
lady
theobald
had
made
with
her
had
been
a
very
brief
one
but
octavia
had
taken
a
decided
fancy
to
lucia
and
was
glad
to
see
her
again
i
am
glad
to
see
you
belinda
said
her
ladyship
shaking
hands
and
you
also
miss
octavia
thank
you
responded
octavia
you
are
very
kind
miss
belinda
murmured
gratefully
i
hope
you
are
both
well
said
lady
theobald
with
majestic
condescension
and
in
tones
to
be
heard
all
over
the
room
quite
well
thank
you
murmured
miss
belinda
again
well
indeed
rather
as
if
this
fortunate
state
of
affairs
was
the
result
of
her
ladyship
kind
intervention
with
the
fates
she
felt
terribly
conscious
of
being
the
centre
of
observation
and
rather
overpowered
by
the
novelty
of
her
attire
which
was
plainly
creating
a
sensation
octavia
however
who
was
far
more
looked
at
was
entirely
oblivious
of
the
painful
prominence
of
her
position
she
remained
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
talking
to
lucia
who
had
approached
to
greet
her
she
was
so
much
taller
than
lucia
that
she
looked
very
tall
indeed
by
contrast
and
also
very
wonderfully
dressed
lucia
white
muslin
was
one
of
miss
chickie
fifteen
and
was
in
a
genteel
way
very
suggestive
of
slowbridge
suspended
from
waist
by
a
long
loop
of
the
embroidered
ribbon
was
a
little
round
fan
of
downy
feathers
and
with
this
she
played
as
she
talked
but
lucia
having
nothing
to
play
with
could
only
stand
with
her
little
hands
hanging
at
her
sides
i
have
never
been
to
an
afternoon
tea
like
this
before
octavia
said
it
is
nothing
like
a
i
am
not
sure
that
i
know
what
a
is
lucia
answered
they
have
them
in
london
i
think
but
i
have
never
been
to
london
they
have
them
in
new
york
said
octavia
and
they
are
a
crowded
sort
of
afternoon
parties
where
ladies
go
in
not
evening
dress
people
are
rushing
in
and
out
all
the
time
lucia
glanced
around
the
room
and
smiled
that
is
very
unlike
this
she
remarked
well
said
octavia
i
should
think
that
after
all
this
might
be
nicer
which
was
very
civil
lucia
glanced
around
again
this
time
rather
stealthily
at
lady
theobald
then
she
glanced
back
at
octavia
but
it
is
she
said
in
an
undertone
octavia
began
to
laugh
they
were
on
a
new
and
familiar
footing
from
that
moment
i
said
might
she
answered
she
was
not
afraid
any
longer
of
finding
the
evening
stupid
if
there
were
no
young
men
there
was
at
least
a
young
woman
who
was
in
sympathy
with
her
she
said
i
hope
that
i
shall
behave
myself
pretty
well
and
do
the
things
i
am
expected
to
do
oh
said
lucia
with
a
rather
alarmed
expression
i
hope
so
i
i
am
afraid
you
would
not
be
comfortable
if
you
did
octavia
opened
her
eyes
as
she
often
did
at
miss
belinda
remarks
and
then
suddenly
she
began
to
laugh
again
what
would
they
do
she
said
disrespectfully
would
they
turn
me
out
without
giving
me
any
tea
lucia
looked
still
more
frightened
do
let
them
see
you
laughing
she
said
they
they
will
say
you
are
giddy
giddy
replied
octavia
i
do
think
there
is
any
thing
to
make
me
giddy
here
if
they
say
you
are
giddy
said
lucia
your
fate
will
be
sealed
and
if
you
are
to
stay
here
it
really
will
be
better
to
try
to
please
them
a
little
octavia
reflected
a
moment
i
do
mean
to
them
she
said
unless
they
are
very
easily
displeased
i
suppose
i
do
think
very
much
about
what
people
are
saying
of
me
i
do
seem
to
notice
will
you
come
now
and
let
me
introduce
miss
egerton
and
her
sister
suggested
lucia
hurriedly
grandmamma
is
looking
at
us
in
the
innocence
of
her
heart
octavia
glanced
at
lady
theobald
and
saw
that
she
was
looking
at
them
and
with
a
disapproving
air
i
wonder
what
that
for
she
said
to
herself
but
she
followed
lucia
across
the
room
she
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
misses
egerton
who
seemed
rather
fluttered
and
after
the
first
exchange
of
civilities
subsided
into
monosyllables
and
attentive
stares
they
were
indeed
very
anxious
to
hear
octavia
converse
but
had
not
the
courage
to
attempt
to
draw
her
out
unless
a
sudden
query
of
miss
lydia
could
be
considered
such
an
attempt
do
you
like
england
she
asked
is
this
england
inquired
octavia
it
is
a
part
of
england
of
course
replied
the
young
lady
with
calm
literalness
then
of
course
i
like
it
very
much
said
octavia
slightly
waving
her
fan
and
smiling
miss
lydia
egerton
and
miss
violet
egerton
each
regarded
her
in
dubious
silence
for
a
moment
they
did
not
think
she
looked
as
if
she
were
clever
but
the
speech
sounded
to
both
as
if
she
were
and
as
if
she
meant
to
be
clever
a
little
at
their
expense
naturally
after
that
they
felt
slightly
uncomfortable
and
said
less
than
before
and
conversation
lagged
to
such
an
extent
that
octavia
was
not
sorry
when
tea
was
announced
and
it
so
happened
that
tea
was
not
the
only
thing
announced
the
ladies
had
all
just
risen
from
their
seats
with
a
gentle
rustle
and
lady
theobald
was
moving
forward
to
marshal
her
procession
into
the
when
dobson
appeared
at
the
door
again
barold
my
lady
he
said
and
mr
burmistone
everybody
glanced
first
at
the
door
and
then
at
lady
theobald
francis
barold
crossed
the
threshold
followed
by
the
tall
builder
of
mills
who
was
a
strong
handsome
man
and
bore
himself
very
well
not
seeming
to
mind
at
all
the
numerous
eyes
fixed
upon
him
i
did
not
know
said
barold
that
we
should
find
you
had
guests
beg
pardon
i
sure
and
so
does
burmistone
whom
i
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
at
broadoaks
and
who
was
good
enough
to
invite
me
to
return
with
him
lady
theobald
extended
her
hand
to
the
gentleman
specified
i
am
glad
she
said
rigidly
to
see
mr
burmistone
then
she
turned
to
barold
this
is
very
fortunate
she
announced
we
are
just
going
in
to
take
tea
in
which
i
hope
you
will
join
us
lucia
francis
barold
naturally
turned
as
her
ladyship
uttered
her
granddaughter
name
in
a
tone
of
command
it
may
be
supposed
that
his
first
intention
in
turning
was
to
look
at
lucia
but
he
had
scarcely
done
so
when
his
attention
was
attracted
by
the
figure
nearest
to
her
the
figure
of
a
young
lady
who
was
playing
with
a
little
blue
fan
and
smiling
at
him
brilliantly
and
unmistakably
the
next
moment
he
was
standing
at
octavia
bassett
side
looking
rather
pleased
and
the
blood
of
slowbridge
was
congealing
as
the
significance
of
the
situation
was
realized
one
instant
of
breathless
of
awful
suspense
and
her
ladyship
recovered
herself
we
will
go
in
to
tea
she
said
may
i
ask
you
burmistone
to
accompany
miss
pilcher
chapter
xi
a
slight
indiscretion
during
the
remainder
of
the
evening
miss
belinda
was
a
prey
to
wretchedness
and
despair
when
she
raised
her
eyes
to
her
hostess
she
met
with
a
glance
full
of
icy
significance
when
she
looked
across
the
she
saw
octavia
seated
next
to
francis
barold
monopolizing
his
attention
and
apparently
in
the
very
best
possible
spirits
it
only
made
matters
worse
that
francis
barold
seemed
to
find
her
remarks
worthy
of
his
attention
he
drank
very
little
tea
and
now
and
then
appeared
much
interested
and
amused
in
fact
he
found
miss
octavia
even
more
entertaining
than
he
had
found
her
during
their
journey
she
did
not
hesitate
at
all
to
tell
him
that
she
was
delighted
to
see
him
again
at
this
particular
juncture
you
do
know
how
glad
i
was
to
see
you
come
in
she
said
she
met
his
rather
startled
glance
with
the
most
open
candor
as
she
spoke
it
is
very
civil
of
you
to
say
so
he
said
but
you
can
hardly
expect
me
to
believe
it
you
know
it
is
too
good
to
be
true
i
thought
it
was
too
good
to
be
true
when
the
door
opened
she
answered
cheerfully
i
should
have
been
glad
to
see
almost
well
that
he
interposed
is
quite
so
civil
it
is
not
quite
so
civil
to
but
there
she
checked
herself
and
asked
him
a
question
with
the
most
seriousness
are
you
a
great
friend
of
lady
theobald
she
said
no
he
answered
i
am
a
relative
that
worse
she
remarked
it
is
he
replied
very
much
worse
i
asked
you
she
proceeded
with
an
entrancing
little
smile
of
irreverent
approval
because
i
was
going
to
say
that
my
last
speech
was
not
quite
so
civil
to
lady
theobald
that
is
perfectly
true
he
responded
it
was
civil
to
her
at
all
he
was
passing
his
time
very
comfortably
and
was
really
surprised
to
feel
that
he
was
more
interested
in
these
simple
audacities
than
he
had
been
in
any
conversation
for
some
time
perhaps
it
was
because
his
companion
was
so
wonderfully
pretty
but
it
is
not
unlikely
that
there
were
also
other
reasons
she
looked
him
straight
in
the
eyes
she
comported
herself
after
the
manner
of
a
young
lady
who
was
enjoying
herself
and
yet
he
felt
vaguely
that
she
might
have
enjoyed
herself
quite
as
much
with
burmistone
and
that
it
was
probable
that
she
would
not
think
a
second
time
of
him
or
of
what
she
said
to
him
after
tea
when
they
returned
to
the
the
opportunities
afforded
for
conversation
were
not
numerous
the
piano
was
opened
and
one
after
another
of
the
young
ladies
were
invited
to
exhibit
their
prowess
upon
its
musical
education
slowbridge
prided
itself
few
towns
miss
pilcher
frequently
remarked
could
be
congratulated
upon
the
possession
of
talent
and
cultivation
the
misses
egerton
played
a
duet
the
misses
loftus
sang
miss
abercrombie
executed
a
sonata
with
such
effect
as
to
melt
miss
pilcher
to
tears
and
still
octavia
had
not
been
called
upon
there
might
have
been
a
reason
for
this
or
there
might
not
but
the
moment
arrived
at
length
when
lady
theobald
moved
toward
miss
belinda
with
evidently
fell
intent
perhaps
she
said
perhaps
your
niece
miss
octavia
will
favor
us
miss
belinda
replied
in
a
deprecatory
and
uncertain
murmur
i
am
not
sure
i
really
do
know
perhaps
octavia
my
dear
octavia
raised
a
smiling
face
i
do
play
she
said
i
never
learned
you
do
not
play
exclaimed
lady
theobald
you
do
not
play
at
all
no
answered
octavia
not
a
note
and
i
think
i
am
rather
glad
of
it
because
if
i
tried
i
should
be
sure
to
do
it
worse
than
other
people
i
would
rather
with
unimpaired
cheerfulness
let
some
one
else
do
it
there
were
a
few
seconds
of
dead
silence
a
dozen
people
seated
around
her
had
heard
miss
pilcher
shuddered
miss
belinda
looked
down
francis
barold
preserved
an
entirely
unmoved
countenance
the
general
impression
being
that
he
was
very
much
shocked
and
concealed
his
disgust
with
an
effort
my
dear
said
lady
theobald
with
an
air
of
much
condescension
and
some
grave
pity
i
should
advise
you
to
try
to
learn
i
can
assure
you
that
you
would
find
it
a
great
source
of
pleasure
if
you
could
assure
me
that
my
friends
would
find
it
a
great
source
of
pleasure
i
might
begin
answered
the
mistaken
young
person
still
cheerfully
but
i
am
afraid
they
would
it
seemed
that
fate
had
marked
her
for
disgrace
in
half
an
hour
from
that
time
she
capped
the
climax
of
her
indiscretions
the
evening
being
warm
the
french
windows
had
been
left
open
and
in
passing
one
of
them
she
stopped
a
moment
to
look
out
at
the
brightly
moonlit
grounds
barold
who
was
with
her
paused
too
looks
rather
nice
does
it
he
said
yes
she
replied
suppose
we
go
out
on
the
terrace
he
laughed
in
an
amused
fashion
she
did
not
understand
suppose
we
do
he
said
by
jove
that
a
good
idea
he
laughed
as
he
followed
her
what
amuses
you
so
she
inquired
oh
he
replied
i
am
merely
thinking
of
lady
theobald
well
she
commented
i
think
it
rather
disrespectful
in
you
to
laugh
is
it
a
lovely
night
i
did
think
you
had
such
moonlight
nights
in
england
what
a
night
for
a
drive
is
that
one
of
the
things
you
do
in
america
drive
by
moonlight
yes
do
you
mean
to
say
you
do
do
it
in
england
not
often
is
it
young
ladies
who
drive
by
moonlight
in
america
well
you
do
suppose
they
go
alone
do
you
quite
ironically
of
course
they
have
some
one
with
them
ah
their
papas
no
their
mammas
no
their
governesses
their
uncles
their
aunts
no
with
a
little
smile
he
smiled
also
that
is
another
good
idea
he
said
you
have
a
great
many
nice
ideas
in
america
she
was
silent
a
moment
or
so
swinging
her
fan
slowly
to
and
fro
by
its
ribbon
and
appearing
to
reflect
does
that
mean
she
said
at
length
that
it
would
be
considered
proper
in
england
i
hope
you
wo
hold
me
responsible
for
english
fallacies
was
his
sole
answer
i
do
hold
anybody
responsible
for
them
she
returned
with
some
spirit
i
do
care
one
thing
about
them
that
is
fortunate
he
commented
i
am
happy
to
say
i
do
either
i
take
the
liberty
of
pleasing
myself
i
find
it
pays
best
perhaps
she
said
returning
to
the
charge
perhaps
lady
theobald
will
think
is
improper
he
put
his
hand
up
and
stroked
his
mustache
lightly
without
replying
but
it
is
she
added
emphatically
it
is
no
he
admitted
with
a
touch
of
irony
it
is
not
are
any
the
worse
for
it
she
demanded
well
really
i
think
not
as
yet
he
replied
then
we
wo
go
in
she
said
the
smile
returning
to
her
lips
again
chapter
xii
an
invitation
in
the
mean
time
burmistone
was
improving
his
opportunities
within
doors
he
had
listened
to
the
music
with
the
most
serious
attention
and
on
its
conclusion
he
had
turned
to
burnham
and
made
himself
very
agreeable
indeed
at
length
however
he
arose
and
sauntered
across
the
room
to
a
table
at
which
lucia
gaston
chanced
to
be
standing
alone
having
just
been
deserted
by
a
young
lady
whose
mamma
had
summoned
her
she
wore
burmistone
regretted
to
see
as
he
advanced
a
troubled
and
anxious
expression
the
truth
being
that
she
had
a
moment
before
remarked
the
exit
of
miss
belinda
niece
and
her
companion
it
happened
oddly
that
burmistone
first
words
touched
upon
the
subject
of
her
thought
he
began
quite
abruptly
with
it
it
seems
to
me
he
said
that
miss
octavia
bassett
lucia
stopped
him
with
a
courage
which
surprised
herself
oh
if
you
please
she
implored
do
say
any
thing
unkind
about
her
burmistone
looked
down
into
her
soft
eyes
with
a
good
deal
of
feeling
i
was
not
going
to
say
any
thing
unkind
he
answered
why
should
i
everybody
seems
to
find
a
reason
for
speaking
severely
of
her
lucia
faltered
i
have
heard
so
many
unkind
things
tonight
that
i
am
quite
unhappy
i
am
sure
i
am
she
is
very
candid
and
simple
yes
answered
burmistone
i
am
sure
she
is
very
candid
and
simple
why
should
we
expect
her
to
be
exactly
like
ourselves
lucia
went
on
how
can
we
be
sure
that
our
way
is
better
than
any
other
why
should
they
be
angry
because
her
dress
is
so
expensive
and
pretty
indeed
i
only
wish
i
had
such
a
dress
it
is
a
thousand
times
prettier
than
any
we
ever
wear
look
around
the
room
and
see
if
it
is
not
and
as
to
her
not
having
learned
to
play
on
the
piano
or
to
speak
french
why
should
she
be
obliged
to
do
things
she
feels
she
would
not
be
clever
at
i
am
not
clever
and
have
been
a
sort
of
slave
all
my
life
and
have
been
scolded
and
blamed
for
what
i
could
not
help
at
all
until
i
have
felt
as
if
i
must
be
a
criminal
how
happy
she
must
have
been
to
be
let
alone
she
had
clasped
her
little
hands
and
though
she
spoke
in
a
low
voice
was
quite
impassioned
in
an
unconscious
way
her
brief
girlish
life
had
not
been
a
very
happy
one
as
may
be
easily
imagined
and
a
glimpse
of
the
liberty
for
which
she
had
suffered
roused
her
to
a
sense
of
her
own
wrongs
we
are
all
cut
out
after
the
same
pattern
she
said
we
learn
the
same
things
and
wear
the
same
dresses
one
might
say
what
lydia
egerton
has
been
taught
i
have
been
taught
yet
what
two
creatures
could
be
more
unlike
each
other
by
nature
than
we
are
burmistone
glanced
across
the
room
at
miss
egerton
she
was
a
fine
robust
young
woman
with
a
high
nose
and
a
stolid
expression
of
countenance
that
is
true
he
remarked
we
are
afraid
of
every
thing
said
lucia
bitterly
lydia
egerton
is
afraid
though
you
might
not
think
so
and
as
for
me
nobody
knows
what
a
coward
i
am
but
myself
yes
i
am
a
coward
when
grandmamma
looks
at
me
i
tremble
i
dare
not
speak
my
mind
and
differ
with
her
when
i
know
she
is
unjust
and
in
the
wrong
no
one
could
say
that
of
miss
octavia
bassett
that
is
perfectly
true
said
burmistone
and
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
laugh
as
he
thought
of
miss
octavia
trembling
in
the
august
presence
of
lady
theobald
the
laugh
checked
lucia
at
once
in
her
little
outburst
of
eloquence
she
began
to
blush
the
color
mounting
to
her
forehead
oh
she
began
i
did
not
mean
to
to
say
so
much
i
there
was
something
so
innocent
and
touching
in
her
sudden
timidity
and
confusion
that
burmistone
forgot
altogether
that
they
were
not
very
old
friends
and
that
lady
theobald
might
be
looking
he
bent
slightly
forward
and
looked
into
her
upraised
alarmed
eyes
do
be
afraid
of
he
said
do
for
pity
sake
he
could
not
have
hit
upon
a
luckier
speech
and
also
he
could
not
have
uttered
it
more
feelingly
than
he
did
it
helped
her
to
recover
herself
and
gave
her
courage
there
she
said
with
a
slight
catch
of
the
breath
does
not
that
prove
what
i
said
to
be
true
i
was
afraid
the
very
moment
i
ceased
to
forget
myself
i
was
afraid
of
you
and
of
myself
i
have
no
courage
at
all
you
will
gain
it
in
time
he
said
i
shall
try
to
gain
it
she
answered
i
am
nearly
twenty
and
it
is
time
that
i
should
learn
to
respect
myself
i
think
it
must
be
because
i
have
no
that
i
am
such
a
coward
it
seemed
that
her
resolution
was
to
be
tried
immediately
for
at
that
very
moment
lady
theobald
turned
and
on
recognizing
the
full
significance
of
lucia
position
was
apparently
struck
temporarily
dumb
and
motionless
when
she
recovered
from
the
shock
she
made
a
majestic
gesture
of
command
burmistone
glanced
at
the
girl
face
and
saw
that
it
changed
color
a
little
lady
theobald
appears
to
wish
to
speak
to
you
he
said
lucia
left
her
seat
and
walked
across
the
room
with
a
steady
air
lady
theobald
did
not
remove
her
eye
from
her
until
she
stopped
within
three
feet
of
her
then
she
asked
a
rather
unnecessary
question
with
whom
have
you
been
conversing
with
mr
burmistone
upon
what
subject
we
were
speaking
of
miss
octavia
bassett
her
ladyship
glanced
around
the
room
as
if
a
new
idea
had
occurred
to
her
and
said
where
miss
octavia
bassett
here
it
must
be
confessed
that
lucia
faltered
she
is
on
the
terrace
with
mr
barold
she
is
on
her
ladyship
stopped
short
in
the
middle
of
her
sentence
this
was
too
much
for
her
she
left
lucia
and
crossed
the
room
to
miss
belinda
belinda
she
said
in
an
awful
undertone
your
niece
is
out
upon
the
terrace
with
barold
perhaps
it
would
be
as
well
for
you
to
intimate
to
her
that
in
england
it
is
not
customary
that
belinda
go
and
bring
her
in
miss
belinda
arose
actually
looking
pale
she
had
been
making
such
strenuous
efforts
to
converse
with
miss
pilcher
and
burnham
that
she
had
been
betrayed
into
forgetting
her
charge
she
could
scarcely
believe
her
ears
she
went
to
the
open
window
and
looked
out
and
then
turned
paler
than
before
octavia
my
dear
she
said
faintly
francis
said
lady
theobald
over
her
shoulder
francis
barold
turned
a
rather
bored
countenance
toward
them
but
it
was
evidently
not
octavia
who
had
bored
him
octavia
said
miss
belinda
how
imprudent
in
that
thin
dress
the
night
air
how
could
you
my
dear
how
could
you
oh
i
shall
not
catch
cold
octavia
answered
i
am
used
to
it
i
have
been
out
hours
and
hours
on
moonlight
nights
at
home
but
she
moved
toward
them
you
must
remember
said
lady
theobald
that
there
are
many
things
which
may
be
done
in
america
which
would
not
be
safe
in
england
and
she
made
the
remark
in
an
almost
sepulchral
tone
of
warning
how
miss
belinda
would
have
supported
herself
if
the
coach
had
not
been
announced
at
this
juncture
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
the
coach
was
announced
and
they
took
their
departure
barold
happening
to
make
his
adieus
at
the
same
time
they
were
escorted
by
him
down
to
the
vehicle
from
the
blue
lion
when
he
had
assisted
them
in
and
closed
the
door
octavia
bent
forward
so
that
the
moonlight
fell
full
on
her
pretty
head
and
the
sparkling
drops
in
her
ears
oh
she
exclaimed
if
you
stay
here
at
all
you
must
come
and
see
aunt
belinda
ask
him
to
come
and
see
us
miss
belinda
could
scarcely
speak
i
shall
be
most
most
happy
she
fluttered
any
friend
of
dear
lady
theobald
of
course
do
forget
said
octavia
waving
her
hand
the
coach
moved
off
and
miss
belinda
sank
back
into
a
dark
corner
my
dear
she
gasped
what
will
he
think
octavia
was
winding
her
lace
scarf
around
her
throat
he
think
i
want
him
to
call
she
said
serenely
and
i

chapter
xiii
intentions
the
position
in
which
lady
theobald
found
herself
placed
after
these
occurrences
was
certainly
a
difficult
and
unpleasant
one
it
was
francis
barold
caprice
for
the
time
being
to
develop
an
intimacy
with
burmistone
he
had
it
seemed
chosen
to
become
interested
in
him
during
their
sojourn
at
broadoaks
he
had
discovered
him
to
be
a
desirable
companion
and
a
clever
amiable
fellow
this
much
he
condescended
to
explain
incidentally
to
her
ladyship
self
i
ca
say
i
expected
to
meet
a
nice
fellow
or
a
companionable
fellow
he
remarked
and
i
was
agreeably
surprised
to
find
him
both
never
says
too
much
or
too
little
never
bores
a
man
to
this
lady
theobald
could
make
no
reply
singularly
enough
she
had
discovered
early
in
their
acquaintance
that
her
wonted
weapons
were
likely
to
dull
their
edges
upon
the
steely
coldness
of
francis
barold
impassibility
in
the
presence
of
this
fortunate
young
man
before
whom
his
world
had
bowed
the
knee
from
his
tenderest
infancy
she
lost
the
majesty
of
her
demeanor
he
refused
to
be
affected
by
it
he
was
even
implacable
enough
to
show
openly
that
it
bored
him
and
to
insinuate
by
his
manner
that
he
did
not
intend
to
submit
to
it
he
entirely
ignored
the
claim
of
relationship
and
acted
according
to
the
promptings
of
his
own
moods
he
did
not
feel
it
at
all
incumbent
upon
him
to
remain
at
oldclough
hall
and
subject
himself
to
the
customs
there
in
vogue
he
preferred
to
accept
burmistone
invitation
to
become
his
guest
at
the
handsome
house
he
had
just
completed
in
which
he
lived
in
bachelor
splendor
accordingly
he
installed
himself
there
and
thereby
complicated
matters
greatly
slowbridge
found
itself
in
a
position
as
difficult
as
and
far
more
delicate
than
lady
theobald
the
in
honor
of
that
troublesome
young
person
miss
octavia
bassett
having
been
inaugurated
by
her
ladyship
must
go
the
social
rounds
according
to
ancient
custom
but
what
in
discretion
name
was
to
be
done
concerning
francis
barold
there
was
no
doubt
whatever
that
he
must
not
be
ignored
and
in
that
case
what
difficulties
presented
themselves
the
mamma
of
the
two
misses
egerton
who
was
a
nervous
and
easily
subjugated
person
was
so
excited
and
overwrought
by
the
prospect
before
her
that
in
contemplating
it
when
she
wrote
her
invitations
she
was
affected
to
tears
i
can
assure
you
lydia
she
said
that
i
have
not
slept
for
three
nights
i
have
been
so
harassed
here
on
one
hand
is
francis
barold
who
must
be
invited
and
on
the
other
is
burmistone
whom
we
can
not
pass
over
and
here
is
lady
theobald
who
will
turn
to
stone
the
moment
she
sees
him
though
goodness
knows
i
am
sure
he
seems
a
very
quiet
respectable
man
and
said
some
of
the
most
complimentary
things
about
your
playing
and
here
is
that
dreadful
girl
who
is
enough
to
give
one
cold
chills
and
who
may
do
all
sorts
of
dreadful
things
and
is
certainly
a
living
example
to
all
respectable
girls
and
the
blindest
of
the
blind
could
see
that
nothing
would
offend
lady
theobald
more
fatally
than
to
let
her
be
thrown
with
francis
barold
and
how
one
is
to
invite
them
into
the
same
room
and
keep
them
apart
i
sure
i
do
know
how
lady
theobald
herself
could
not
do
it
and
how
can
we
be
expected
to
and
the
refreshments
on
my
mind
too
and
forbes
failing
on
her
and
bringing
up
sally
lunns
like
lead
that
these
misgivings
were
equally
shared
by
each
entertainer
in
prospective
might
be
adduced
from
the
fact
that
the
same
afternoon
burnham
and
miss
pilcher
appeared
upon
the
scene
to
consult
with
egerton
upon
the
subject
miss
lydia
and
miss
violet
being
dismissed
to
their
practising
the
three
ladies
sat
in
the
darkened
parlor
and
talked
the
matter
over
in
solemn
conclave
i
have
consulted
miss
pilcher
and
mentioned
the
affair
to
gibson
announced
burnham
and
really
we
have
not
yet
been
able
to
arrive
at
any
conclusion
egerton
shook
her
head
tearfully
pray
do
come
to
me
my
dears
she
said
do
i
beg
of
you
i
have
thought
about
it
until
my
circulation
has
all
gone
wrong
and
lydia
has
been
applying
bottles
to
my
feet
all
the
morning
i
gave
it
up
at
two
and
set
violet
to
writing
invitations
to
one
and
all
let
the
consequences
be
what
they
may
miss
pilcher
glanced
at
burnham
and
burnham
glanced
at
miss
pilcher
perhaps
miss
pilcher
suggested
to
her
companion
it
would
be
as
well
for
you
to
mention
your
impressions
burnham
manner
became
additionally
cautious
she
bent
forward
slightly
my
dear
she
said
has
it
struck
you
that
lady
theobald
has
any
intentions
so
to
speak
intentions
repeated
egerton
yes
with
deep
significance
so
to
speak
with
regard
to
lucia
egerton
looked
utterly
helpless
dear
me
she
ejaculated
plaintively
i
have
never
had
time
to
think
of
it
dear
me
with
regard
to
lucia
burnham
became
more
significant
still
she
added
francis
barold
egerton
turned
to
miss
pilcher
and
saw
confirmation
of
the
fact
in
her
countenance
dear
dear
she
said
that
makes
it
worse
than
ever
it
is
certain
put
in
miss
pilcher
that
the
union
would
be
a
desirable
one
and
we
have
reason
to
remark
that
a
deep
interest
in
francis
barold
has
been
shown
by
lady
theobald
he
has
been
invited
to
make
her
house
his
home
during
his
stay
in
slowbridge
and
though
he
has
not
done
so
the
fact
that
he
has
not
is
due
only
to
some
inexplicable
reluctance
upon
his
own
part
and
we
all
remember
that
lady
theobald
once
plainly
intimated
that
she
anticipated
lucia
forming
in
the
future
a
matrimonial
alliance
oh
commented
egerton
with
some
slight
impatience
it
is
all
very
well
for
lady
theobald
to
have
intentions
for
lucia
but
if
the
young
man
has
none
i
really
do
see
that
her
intentions
will
be
likely
to
result
in
any
thing
particular
and
i
am
sure
francis
barold
is
not
in
the
mood
to
be
influenced
in
that
way
now
he
is
more
likely
to
entertain
himself
with
miss
octavia
bassett
who
will
take
him
out
in
the
moonlight
and
make
herself
agreeable
to
him
in
her
american
style
miss
pilcher
and
burnham
exchanged
glances
again
my
dear
said
burnham
he
has
called
upon
her
twice
since
lady
theobald
tea
they
say
she
invites
him
herself
and
flirts
with
him
openly
in
the
garden
her
conduct
is
such
said
miss
pilcher
with
a
shudder
that
the
blinds
upon
the
side
of
the
seminary
which
faces
miss
bassett
garden
are
kept
closed
by
my
orders
i
have
young
ladies
under
my
care
whose
characters
are
in
process
of
formation
and
whose
parents
repose
confidence
in
me
nothing
but
my
friendship
for
belinda
bassett
remarked
burnham
would
induce
me
to
invite
the
girl
to
my
house
then
she
turned
to
egerton
but
ahem
have
you
included
them
in
your
invitations
she
observed
egerton
became
plaintive
again
i
do
see
how
i
could
be
expected
to
do
any
thing
else
she
said
lady
theobald
herself
could
not
invite
francis
barold
from
burmistone
house
and
leave
burmistone
at
home
and
after
all
i
must
say
it
is
my
opinion
nobody
would
have
objected
to
burmistone
in
the
first
place
if
lady
theobald
had
not
insisted
upon
it
burnham
reflected
perhaps
that
is
true
she
admitted
cautiously
at
length
and
it
must
be
confessed
that
a
man
in
his
position
is
not
entirely
without
his
advantages
particularly
in
a
place
where
there
are
but
few
gentlemen
and
those
scarcely
desirable
as
she
paused
there
discreetly
but
egerton
was
not
so
discreet
there
are
a
great
many
young
ladies
in
slowbridge
she
said
shaking
her
head
a
great
many
and
with
five
in
a
family
all
old
enough
to
be
out
of
school
i
am
sure
it
is
flying
in
the
face
of
providence
to
neglect
one
opportunities
when
the
two
ladies
took
their
departure
burnham
seemed
reflective
finally
she
said
poor
egerton
mind
is
not
what
it
was
and
it
never
was
remarkably
strong
it
must
be
admitted
too
that
there
is
a
lack
of
of
delicacy
those
great
plain
girls
of
hers
must
be
a
trial
to
her
as
she
spoke
they
were
passing
the
privet
hedge
which
surrounded
miss
bassett
house
and
garden
and
a
sound
caused
both
to
glance
around
the
front
door
had
just
been
opened
and
a
gentleman
was
descending
the
steps
a
young
gentleman
in
neat
clerical
garb
his
guileless
ecclesiastical
countenance
suffused
with
mantling
blushes
of
confusion
and
delight
he
stopped
on
the
gravel
path
to
receive
the
last
words
of
miss
octavia
bassett
who
stood
on
the
threshold
smiling
down
upon
him
in
the
prettiest
way
in
the
world
tuesday
afternoon
she
said
now
do
forget
because
i
shall
ask
barold
and
miss
gaston
on
purpose
to
play
against
us
even
james
ca
object
to
croquet
i
indeed
i
shall
be
happy
and
and
delighted
stammered
her
departing
guest
if
you
will
be
so
kind
as
to
to
instruct
me
and
forgive
my
awkwardness
oh
i
instruct
you
said
octavia
i
have
instructed
people
before
and
i
know
how
burnham
clutched
miss
pilcher
arm
do
you
see
who
is
she
demanded
would
you
have
believed
it
miss
pilcher
preserved
a
stony
demeanor
i
would
believe
any
thing
of
miss
octavia
bassett
she
replied
there
would
be
nothing
at
all
remarkable
to
my
mind
in
her
flirting
with
the
bishop
himself
why
should
she
hesitate
to
endeavor
to
entangle
the
curate
of
st
james
chapter
xiv
a
clerical
visit
it
was
indeed
true
that
the
rev
arthur
poppleton
had
spent
the
greater
part
of
his
afternoon
in
miss
belinda
bassett
front
parlor
and
that
octavia
had
entertained
him
in
such
a
manner
that
he
had
been
beguiled
into
forgetting
the
clerical
visits
he
had
intended
to
make
and
had
finally
committed
himself
by
a
promise
to
return
a
day
or
two
later
to
play
croquet
his
object
in
calling
had
been
to
request
miss
assistance
in
a
parochial
matter
his
natural
timorousness
of
nature
had
indeed
led
him
to
put
off
making
the
visit
for
as
long
a
time
as
possible
the
reports
he
had
heard
of
miss
octavia
bassett
had
inspired
him
with
great
dread
consequently
he
had
presented
himself
at
miss
belinda
front
door
with
secret
anguish
will
you
say
he
had
faltered
to
mary
anne
that
it
is
poppleton
to
see
bassett
miss
bassett
and
then
he
had
been
handed
into
the
parlor
the
door
had
been
closed
behind
him
and
he
had
found
himself
shut
up
entirely
alone
in
the
room
with
miss
octavia
bassett
herself
his
first
impulse
was
to
turn
and
flee
precipitately
indeed
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
turn
and
clutch
the
handle
of
the
door
but
somehow
a
second
thought
arrived
in
time
to
lead
him
to
control
himself
this
second
thought
came
with
his
second
glance
at
octavia
she
was
not
at
all
what
he
had
pictured
her
singularly
enough
no
one
had
told
him
that
she
was
pretty
and
he
had
thought
of
her
as
a
gaunt
young
person
with
a
determined
and
manly
air
she
struck
him
on
the
contrary
as
being
extremely
girlish
and
charming
to
look
upon
she
wore
the
pale
pink
gown
and
as
he
entered
he
saw
her
give
a
furtive
little
dab
to
her
eyes
with
a
lace
handkerchief
and
hurriedly
crush
an
open
letter
into
her
pocket
then
seeming
to
dismiss
her
emotion
with
enviable
facility
she
rose
to
greet
him
if
you
want
to
see
aunt
belinda
she
said
perhaps
you
had
better
sit
down
she
will
be
here
directly
he
plucked
up
spirit
to
take
a
seat
suddenly
feeling
his
terror
take
wing
he
was
amazed
at
his
own
courage
you
he
said
i
have
the
pleasure
of
there
it
is
true
he
stopped
looked
at
her
blushed
and
finished
somewhat
disjointedly
miss
octavia
bassett
i
believe
yes
she
answered
and
sat
down
near
him
when
miss
belinda
descended
the
stairs
a
short
time
afterward
her
ears
were
greeted
by
the
sound
of
brisk
conversation
in
which
the
rev
arthur
poppleton
appeared
to
be
taking
part
with
spirit
when
he
arose
at
her
entrance
there
was
in
his
manner
an
air
of
mild
buoyancy
which
astonished
her
beyond
measure
when
he
himself
he
seemed
quite
to
forget
the
object
of
his
visit
for
some
minutes
and
was
thus
placed
in
the
embarrassing
position
of
having
to
refer
to
his
having
done
so
and
found
that
he
had
called
to
ask
assistance
for
the
family
of
one
of
his
parishioners
he
recovered
himself
somewhat
as
he
explained
the
exigencies
of
the
case
octavia
listened
well
she
said
i
should
think
it
would
make
you
quite
uncomfortable
if
you
see
things
like
that
often
i
regret
to
say
i
do
see
such
things
only
too
frequently
he
answered
gracious
she
said
but
that
was
all
he
was
conscious
of
being
slightly
disappointed
at
her
apathy
and
perhaps
it
is
to
be
deplored
that
he
forgot
it
afterward
when
miss
belinda
had
bestowed
her
mite
and
the
case
was
dismissed
for
the
time
being
he
really
did
forget
it
and
was
beguiled
into
making
a
very
long
call
and
enjoying
himself
as
he
had
never
enjoyed
himself
before
when
at
length
he
was
recalled
to
a
sense
of
duty
by
a
glance
at
the
clock
he
had
already
before
his
eyes
an
opening
vista
of
delights
taking
the
form
of
future
calls
and
games
of
croquet
played
upon
miss
belinda
he
had
bidden
the
ladies
adieu
in
the
parlor
and
having
stepped
into
the
hall
was
fumbling
rather
excitedly
in
the
for
his
own
especially
slender
clerical
umbrella
when
he
was
awakened
to
new
rapture
by
hearing
miss
octavia
tone
again
he
turned
and
saw
her
standing
quite
near
him
looking
at
him
with
rather
an
odd
expression
and
holding
something
in
her
hand
oh
she
said
see
here
those
people
i
beg
pardon
he
hesitated
i
do
quite
understand
oh
yes
she
answered
those
desperately
poor
wretches
you
know
with
fever
and
leaks
in
their
house
and
all
sorts
of
disagreeable
things
the
matter
with
them
give
them
this
wo
you
this
was
a
pretty
silk
purse
through
whose
meshes
he
saw
the
gleam
of
gold
coin
that
he
said
you
do
mean
is
there
a
good
deal
i
beg
pardon
but
really
well
if
they
are
as
poor
as
you
say
they
are
it
wo
be
too
much
she
replied
i
do
suppose
they
object
to
it
do
you
she
extended
it
to
him
as
if
she
rather
wished
to
get
it
out
of
her
hands
you
better
take
it
she
said
i
shall
spend
it
on
something
i
need
if
you
do
i
always
spending
money
on
things
i
do
care
for
afterward
he
was
filled
with
remorse
remembering
that
he
had
thought
her
apathetic
i
i
really
thought
you
were
not
interested
at
all
he
burst
forth
pray
forgive
me
this
is
generous
indeed
she
looked
down
at
some
particularly
brilliant
rings
on
her
hand
instead
of
looking
at
him
oh
well
she
said
i
think
it
must
be
simply
horrid
to
have
to
do
without
things
i
ca
see
how
people
live
besides
i
have
denied
myself
any
thing
it
would
be
worth
talking
about
if
i
had
i
suppose
oh
by
the
by
never
mind
telling
any
one
will
you
then
without
giving
him
time
to
reply
she
raised
her
eyes
to
his
face
and
plunged
into
the
subject
of
the
croquet
again
pursuing
it
until
the
final
moment
of
his
exit
and
departure
which
was
when
burnham
and
miss
pilcher
had
been
scandalized
at
the
easy
freedom
of
her
adieus
chapter
xv
superior
advantages
when
francis
barold
called
to
pay
his
respects
to
lady
theobald
after
partaking
of
her
hospitality
burmistone
accompanied
him
and
upon
almost
every
other
occasion
of
his
presenting
himself
to
her
ladyship
burmistone
was
his
companion
it
may
as
well
be
explained
at
the
outset
that
the
of
burmistone
mills
was
a
man
of
decided
determination
of
character
and
that
upon
the
evening
of
lady
theobald
tea
he
had
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
he
would
spare
no
effort
to
gain
a
certain
end
he
felt
it
would
add
to
his
happiness
to
accomplish
i
stand
rather
in
awe
of
lady
theobald
as
any
ordinary
man
would
he
had
said
dryly
to
barold
on
their
return
to
his
house
but
my
awe
of
her
is
not
so
great
yet
that
i
shall
allow
it
to
interfere
with
any
of
my
plans
have
you
any
especial
plan
inquired
barold
carelessly
after
a
pause
yes
answered
burmistone
several
i
should
like
to
go
to
oldclough
rather
often
i
feel
it
the
civil
thing
to
go
to
oldclough
oftener
than
i
like
go
with
me
i
should
like
to
be
included
in
all
the
invitations
to
tea
for
the
next
six
months
i
shall
be
included
in
all
the
invitations
so
long
as
i
remain
here
and
it
is
not
likely
you
will
be
left
out
in
the
cold
after
you
have
gone
the
rounds
once
you
wo
be
dropped
upon
the
whole
it
appears
so
said
burmistone
thanks
so
at
each
of
the
following
lady
theobald
the
two
men
appeared
together
the
small
end
of
the
wedge
being
inserted
into
the
social
stratum
the
rest
was
not
so
difficult
burnham
was
at
once
surprised
and
overjoyed
by
her
discoveries
of
the
many
excellences
of
the
man
they
had
so
hastily
determined
to
ignore
abercrombie
found
burmistone
manner
all
that
could
be
desired
miss
pilcher
expressed
the
highest
appreciation
of
his
views
upon
feminine
education
and
our
duty
to
the
young
in
our
charge
indeed
after
egerton
evening
the
tide
of
public
opinion
turned
suddenly
in
his
favor
public
opinion
did
not
change
however
as
far
as
octavia
was
concerned
having
had
her
anxiety
set
at
rest
by
several
encouraging
paternal
letters
from
nevada
she
began
to
make
up
her
mind
to
enjoy
herself
and
was
it
is
to
be
regretted
betrayed
by
her
youthful
high
spirits
into
the
committing
of
numerous
indiscretions
upon
each
festal
occasion
she
appeared
in
a
new
and
elaborate
costume
she
accepted
the
attentions
of
francis
barold
as
if
it
were
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
that
they
should
be
offered
she
joked
in
what
burnham
designated
her
nevada
way
with
the
rev
arthur
poppleton
who
appeared
more
frequently
than
had
been
his
habit
at
the
high
teas
she
played
croquet
with
that
gentleman
and
barold
day
after
day
upon
the
before
all
the
eyes
gazing
down
upon
her
from
the
neighboring
windows
she
managed
to
coerce
burmistone
into
joining
these
innocent
orgies
and
in
fact
to
quote
miss
pilcher
there
was
no
limit
to
the
shamelessness
of
her
unfeminine
conduct
several
times
much
comment
had
been
aroused
by
the
fact
that
lucia
gaston
had
been
observed
to
form
one
of
the
party
of
players
she
had
indeed
played
with
barold
against
octavia
and
poppleton
on
the
memorable
day
upon
which
that
gentleman
had
taken
his
first
lesson
barold
had
availed
himself
of
the
invitation
extended
to
him
by
octavia
upon
several
occasions
greatly
to
miss
belinda
embarrassment
he
had
dropped
in
the
evening
after
the
curate
first
call
is
lady
theobald
very
fond
of
you
octavia
had
asked
in
the
course
of
this
visit
it
is
very
kind
of
her
if
she
is
he
replied
with
languid
irony
is
she
fond
enough
of
you
to
do
any
thing
you
ask
her
octavia
inquired
really
i
think
not
he
replied
imagine
the
degree
of
affection
it
requires
i
am
not
fond
enough
of
any
one
to
do
any
thing
they
ask
me
octavia
bestowed
a
long
look
upon
him
well
she
remarked
after
a
pause
i
believe
you
are
not
i
think
so
barold
colored
very
faintly
i
say
he
said
is
that
an
imputation
or
something
of
that
character
it
sounds
like
it
you
know
octavia
did
not
reply
directly
she
laughed
a
little
i
want
you
to
ask
lady
theobald
to
do
something
she
said
i
am
afraid
i
am
not
in
such
favor
as
you
imagine
he
said
looking
slightly
annoyed
well
i
think
she
wo
refuse
you
this
thing
she
went
on
if
she
did
loathe
me
so
i
would
ask
her
myself
he
deigned
to
smile
does
she
loathe
you
he
inquired
yes
nodding
she
would
not
speak
to
me
if
it
were
for
aunt
belinda
she
thinks
i
am
fast
and
loud
do
think
i
am
fast
and
loud
he
was
taken
aback
and
not
for
the
first
time
either
she
had
startled
and
discomposed
him
several
times
in
the
course
of
their
brief
acquaintance
and
he
always
resented
it
priding
himself
in
private
as
he
did
upon
his
coolness
and
immobility
he
could
not
think
of
the
right
thing
to
say
just
now
so
he
was
silent
for
a
second
tell
me
the
truth
she
persisted
i
shall
not
care
much
i
do
not
think
you
would
care
at
all
well
perhaps
i
should
go
on
do
you
think
i
am
fast
i
am
happy
to
say
i
do
not
find
you
slow
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
him
smiling
faintly
that
means
i
am
fast
she
said
well
no
matter
will
you
ask
lady
theobald
what
i
want
you
to
ask
her
i
should
not
say
you
were
fast
at
all
he
said
rather
stiffly
you
have
not
been
educated
as
as
lady
theobald
has
educated
miss
gaston
for
instance
i
should
rather
think
not
she
replied
then
she
added
very
deliberately
she
has
had
what
you
might
call
very
superior
advantages
i
suppose
her
expression
was
totally
incomprehensible
to
him
she
spoke
with
the
utmost
seriousness
and
looked
down
at
the
table
that
is
derision
i
suppose
he
remarked
restively
she
glanced
up
again
at
all
events
she
said
there
is
nothing
to
laugh
at
in
lucia
gaston
will
you
ask
lady
theobald
i
want
you
to
ask
her
to
let
lucia
gaston
come
and
play
croquet
with
us
on
tuesday
she
is
to
play
with
you
against
poppleton
and
me
who
is
mr
poppleton
he
asked
with
some
reserve
he
did
not
exactly
fancy
sharing
his
entertainment
with
any
ordinary
outsider
after
all
there
was
no
knowing
what
this
little
american
might
do
he
is
the
curate
of
the
church
she
replied
undisturbed
he
is
very
nice
and
little
and
neat
and
blushes
all
over
to
the
toes
of
his
boots
he
came
to
see
aunt
belinda
and
i
asked
him
to
come
and
be
taught
to
play
who
is
to
teach
him
i
am
i
have
taught
at
least
twenty
men
in
new
york
and
san
francisco
i
hope
he
appreciates
your
kindness
i
mean
to
try
if
i
can
make
him
forget
to
be
frightened
she
said
with
a
gay
laugh
it
was
certainly
nettling
to
find
his
air
of
reserve
and
displeasure
met
with
such
inconsequent
lightness
she
never
seemed
to
recognize
the
subtle
changes
of
temperature
expressed
in
his
manner
only
his
sense
of
what
was
due
to
himself
prevented
his
being
very
chilly
indeed
but
as
she
went
on
with
her
gay
chat
in
utter
ignorance
of
his
mood
and
indulged
in
some
very
pretty
airy
nonsense
he
soon
recovered
himself
and
almost
forgot
his
private
grievance
before
going
away
he
promised
to
ask
lady
theobald
indulgence
in
the
matter
of
lucia
joining
them
in
their
game
one
speech
of
octavia
connected
with
the
subject
he
had
thought
very
pretty
as
well
as
kind
i
like
miss
gaston
she
said
i
think
we
might
be
friends
if
lady
theobald
would
let
us
her
superior
advantages
might
do
me
good
they
might
improve
me
she
went
on
with
a
little
laugh
and
i
suppose
i
need
improving
very
much
all
my
advantages
have
been
of
one
kind
when
he
had
left
her
she
startled
miss
belinda
by
saying
i
have
been
asking
barold
if
he
thought
i
was
fast
and
i
believe
he
does
in
fact
i
am
sure
he
does
ah
my
dear
my
dear
ejaculated
miss
belinda
what
a
terrible
thing
to
say
to
a
gentleman
what
will
he
think
octavia
smiled
one
of
her
calmest
smiles
is
it
queer
how
often
you
say
that
she
remarked
i
think
i
should
perish
if
i
had
to
pull
myself
up
that
way
as
you
do
i
just
go
right
on
and
never
worry
i
do
mean
to
do
any
thing
queer
and
i
do
see
why
any
one
should
think
i
do
chapter
xvi
croquet
lucia
was
permitted
to
form
one
of
the
players
in
the
game
of
croquet
being
escorted
to
and
from
the
scene
by
francis
barold
perhaps
it
occurred
to
lady
theobald
that
the
contrast
of
english
reserve
and
maidenliness
with
the
manners
of
young
women
from
nevada
might
lead
to
some
good
result
i
trust
your
conduct
will
be
such
as
to
show
that
you
at
least
have
resided
in
a
civilized
land
she
said
the
men
of
the
present
day
may
permit
themselves
to
be
amused
by
young
persons
whose
demeanor
might
bring
a
blush
to
the
cheek
of
a
woman
of
forty
but
it
is
not
their
habit
to
regard
them
with
serious
intentions
lucia
reddened
she
did
not
speak
though
she
wished
very
much
for
the
courage
to
utter
the
words
which
rose
to
her
lips
lately
she
had
found
that
now
and
then
at
times
when
she
was
roused
to
anger
speeches
of
quite
a
clever
and
sarcastic
nature
presented
themselves
to
her
mind
she
was
never
equal
to
uttering
them
aloud
but
she
felt
that
in
time
she
might
because
of
course
it
was
quite
an
advance
in
spirit
to
think
them
and
face
even
in
imagination
the
probability
of
astounding
and
striking
lady
theobald
dumb
with
their
audacity
it
ought
to
make
me
behave
very
well
she
was
saying
now
to
herself
to
have
before
me
the
alternative
of
not
being
regarded
with
serious
intentions
i
wonder
if
it
is
poppleton
or
francis
barold
who
might
not
regard
me
seriously
and
i
wonder
if
they
are
any
coarser
in
america
than
we
can
be
in
england
when
we
try
she
enjoyed
the
afternoon
very
much
particularly
the
latter
part
of
it
when
burmistone
who
was
passing
came
in
being
invited
by
octavia
across
the
privet
hedge
having
paid
his
respects
to
miss
belinda
who
sat
playing
propriety
under
a
burmistone
crossed
the
to
lucia
herself
she
was
awaiting
her
turn
and
laughing
at
the
ardent
enthusiasm
of
poppleton
who
under
octavia
direction
was
devoting
all
his
energies
to
the
game
her
eyes
were
bright
and
she
had
lost
for
the
time
being
her
timid
air
of
feeling
herself
somehow
in
the
wrong
i
am
glad
to
see
you
here
said
burmistone
i
am
glad
to
be
here
she
answered
it
has
been
such
a
happy
afternoon
every
thing
has
seemed
so
bright
and
and
different
is
a
very
good
word
he
said
laughing
it
is
a
very
bad
one
she
returned
and
it
expresses
a
good
deal
it
does
indeed
he
commented
look
at
poppleton
and
octavia
she
began
have
you
got
to
he
inquired
she
looked
down
and
blushed
i
shall
not
say
to
grandmamma
then
suddenly
she
glanced
up
at
him
that
is
sly
is
it
she
said
sometimes
i
think
i
am
very
sly
though
i
am
sure
it
is
not
my
nature
to
be
so
i
would
rather
be
open
and
candid
it
would
be
better
he
remarked
you
think
so
she
asked
eagerly
he
could
not
help
smiling
do
you
ever
tell
untruths
to
lady
theobald
he
inquired
if
you
do
i
shall
begin
to
be
alarmed
i
act
them
she
said
blushing
more
deeply
i
really
do
paltry
sorts
of
untruths
you
know
pretending
to
agree
with
her
when
i
do
pretending
to
like
things
a
little
when
i
hate
them
i
have
been
trying
to
improve
myself
lately
and
once
or
twice
it
has
made
her
very
angry
she
says
i
am
disobedient
and
disrespectful
she
asked
me
one
day
if
it
was
my
intention
to
emulate
miss
octavia
bassett
that
was
when
i
said
i
could
not
help
feeling
that
i
had
wasted
time
in
practising
she
sighed
softly
as
she
ended
in
the
mean
time
octavia
had
poppleton
and
francis
barold
upon
her
hands
and
was
endeavoring
to
do
her
duty
as
hostess
by
both
of
them
if
it
had
been
her
intention
to
captivate
these
gentlemen
she
could
not
have
complained
that
poppleton
was
wary
or
difficult
game
his
first
fears
allayed
his
downward
path
was
smooth
and
rapid
in
proportion
when
he
had
taken
his
departure
with
the
little
silk
purse
in
his
keeping
he
had
carried
under
his
clerical
vest
a
warmed
and
thrilled
heart
it
was
a
heart
which
it
must
be
confessed
was
of
the
most
inexperienced
and
susceptible
nature
a
little
man
of
affectionate
and
gentle
disposition
he
had
been
given
from
his
earliest
youth
to
indulging
in
timid
dreams
of
mild
future
bliss
of
bliss
represented
by
some
lovely
being
whose
ideals
were
similar
to
his
own
and
who
preferred
the
wealth
of
a
true
affection
to
the
glitter
of
the
giddy
throng
upon
one
or
two
occasions
he
had
even
worshipped
from
afar
but
as
on
each
of
these
occasions
his
hopes
had
been
nipped
in
the
bud
by
the
union
of
their
object
with
some
hollow
worldling
his
dream
had
so
far
never
attained
very
serious
proportions
since
he
had
taken
up
his
abode
in
slowbridge
he
had
felt
himself
a
little
overpowered
by
circumstances
it
had
been
a
source
of
painful
embarrassment
to
him
to
find
his
innocent
presence
capable
of
producing
confusion
in
the
breasts
of
young
ladies
who
were
certainly
not
more
guileless
than
himself
he
had
been
conscious
that
the
misses
egerton
did
not
continue
their
conversation
with
freedom
when
he
chanced
to
approach
the
group
they
graced
and
he
had
observed
the
same
thing
in
their
companions
an
additional
circumspection
of
demeanor
so
to
speak
a
touch
of
new
decorum
whose
object
seemed
to
be
to
protect
them
from
any
appearance
of
imprudence
it
is
almost
as
if
they
were
afraid
of
me
he
had
said
to
himself
once
or
twice
dear
me
i
hope
there
is
nothing
in
my
appearance
to
lead
them
to
he
was
so
much
alarmed
by
this
dreadful
thought
that
he
had
ever
afterward
approached
any
of
these
young
ladies
with
a
fear
and
trembling
which
had
not
added
either
to
his
comfort
or
their
own
consequently
his
path
had
not
been
a
very
smooth
one
i
respect
the
young
ladies
of
slowbridge
he
remarked
to
octavia
that
very
afternoon
there
are
some
very
remarkable
young
ladies
here
very
remarkable
indeed
they
are
interested
in
the
church
and
the
poor
and
the
schools
and
indeed
in
every
thing
which
is
most
unselfish
and
amiable
young
ladies
have
usually
so
much
to
distract
their
attention
from
such
matters
if
i
stay
long
enough
in
slowbridge
said
octavia
i
shall
be
interested
in
the
church
and
the
poor
and
the
schools
it
seemed
to
the
curate
that
there
had
never
been
any
thing
so
delightful
in
the
world
as
her
laugh
and
her
unusual
remarks
she
seemed
to
him
so
beautiful
and
so
exhilarating
that
he
forgot
all
else
but
his
admiration
for
her
he
enjoyed
himself
so
much
this
afternoon
that
he
was
almost
brilliant
and
excited
the
sarcastic
comment
of
francis
barold
who
was
not
enjoying
himself
at
all
confound
it
said
that
gentleman
to
himself
as
he
looked
on
what
did
i
come
here
for
this
style
of
thing
is
just
what
i
might
have
expected
she
is
amusing
herself
with
that
poor
little
cad
now
and
i
am
left
in
the
cold
i
suppose
that
is
her
habit
with
the
young
men
in
nevada
he
had
no
intention
of
entering
the
lists
with
the
rev
arthur
poppleton
or
of
concealing
the
fact
that
he
felt
that
this
little
nevada
flirt
was
making
a
blunder
the
sooner
she
knew
it
the
better
for
herself
so
he
played
his
game
as
badly
as
possible
and
with
much
dignity
but
octavia
was
so
deeply
interested
in
poppleton
ardent
efforts
to
do
credit
to
her
teaching
that
she
was
apparently
unconscious
of
all
else
she
played
with
great
cleverness
and
carried
her
partner
to
the
terminus
with
an
eager
enjoyment
of
her
skill
quite
pleasant
to
behold
she
made
little
darts
here
and
there
advised
directed
and
controlled
his
movements
and
was
quite
dramatic
in
a
small
way
when
he
made
a
failure
burnham
who
was
superintending
the
proceeding
seated
in
her
own
behind
her
was
roused
to
virtuous
indignation
by
her
energy
there
is
no
repose
whatever
in
her
manner
she
said
no
dignity
is
a
game
of
croquet
a
matter
of
deep
moment
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
almost
impious
to
devote
one
mind
so
wholly
to
a
mere
means
of
recreation
she
seems
to
be
enjoying
it
mamma
said
miss
laura
burnham
with
a
faint
sigh
miss
laura
had
been
looking
on
over
her
parent
shoulder
they
all
seem
to
be
enjoying
it
see
how
lucia
gaston
and
burmistone
are
laughing
i
never
saw
lucia
look
like
that
before
the
only
one
who
seems
a
little
dull
is
mr
barold
he
is
probably
disgusted
by
a
freedom
of
manner
to
which
he
is
not
accustomed
replied
burnham
the
only
wonder
is
that
he
has
not
been
disgusted
by
it
before
chapter
xvii
advantages
the
game
over
octavia
deserted
her
partner
she
walked
lightly
and
with
the
air
of
a
victor
to
where
barold
was
standing
she
was
smiling
and
slightly
flushed
and
for
a
moment
or
so
stood
fanning
herself
with
a
gay
japanese
fan
do
you
think
i
am
a
good
teacher
she
asked
at
length
i
should
say
so
replied
barold
without
enthusiasm
i
am
afraid
i
am
not
a
judge
she
waved
her
fan
airily
i
had
a
good
pupil
she
said
then
she
held
her
fan
still
for
a
moment
and
turned
fully
toward
him
i
have
done
something
you
do
like
she
said
i
knew
i
had
francis
barold
retired
within
himself
at
once
in
his
present
mood
it
really
appeared
that
she
was
assuming
that
he
was
very
much
interested
indeed
i
should
scarcely
take
the
liberty
upon
a
limited
acquaintance
he
began
she
looked
at
him
steadily
fanning
herself
with
slow
regular
movements
yes
she
remarked
you
mad
i
knew
you
were
he
was
so
evidently
disgusted
by
this
observation
that
she
caught
at
the
meaning
of
his
look
and
laughed
a
little
ah
she
said
that
an
american
word
ai
it
it
sounds
queer
to
you
you
say
instead
of
well
then
you
are
vexed
if
i
have
been
so
clumsy
as
to
appear
he
said
i
beg
pardon
certainly
i
have
no
right
to
exhibit
such
unusual
interest
in
your
conduct
he
felt
that
this
was
rather
decidedly
to
the
point
but
she
did
not
seem
overpowered
at
all
she
smiled
anew
anybody
has
a
right
to
be
mad
i
mean
vexed
she
observed
i
should
like
to
know
how
people
would
live
if
they
had
i
am
mad
i
mean
vexed
twenty
times
a
day
indeed
was
his
sole
reply
well
she
said
i
think
it
real
mean
in
you
to
be
so
cool
about
it
when
you
remember
what
i
told
you
the
other
day
i
regret
to
say
i
do
remember
just
now
i
hope
it
was
nothing
very
serious
to
his
astonishment
she
looked
down
at
her
fan
and
spoke
in
a
slightly
lowered
voice
i
told
you
that
i
wanted
to
be
improved
it
must
be
confessed
that
he
was
mollified
there
was
a
softness
in
her
manner
which
amazed
him
he
was
at
once
embarrassed
and
delighted
but
at
the
same
time
it
would
not
do
to
commit
himself
to
too
great
a
seriousness
oh
he
answered
that
was
a
rather
good
joke
i
thought
no
it
was
she
said
perhaps
even
half
a
tone
lower
i
was
in
earnest
then
she
raised
her
eyes
if
you
told
me
when
i
did
any
thing
wrong
i
think
it
might
be
a
good
thing
she
said
he
felt
that
this
was
quite
possible
and
was
also
struck
with
the
idea
that
he
might
find
the
task
of
mentor
so
long
as
he
remained
entirely
rather
interesting
still
he
could
not
afford
to
descend
at
once
from
the
elevated
stand
he
had
taken
i
am
afraid
you
would
find
it
rather
tiresome
he
remarked
i
am
afraid
would
she
answered
you
would
have
to
tell
me
of
things
so
often
do
you
mean
seriously
to
tell
me
that
you
would
take
my
advice
he
inquired
i
might
take
all
of
it
was
her
reply
but
i
should
take
some
perhaps
a
great
deal
thanks
he
remarked
i
scarcely
think
i
should
give
you
a
great
deal
she
simply
smiled
i
have
never
had
any
advice
at
all
she
said
i
do
know
that
i
should
have
taken
it
if
i
had
just
as
likely
as
not
i
should
but
i
have
never
had
any
father
spoiled
me
he
gave
me
all
my
own
way
he
said
he
did
care
so
long
as
i
had
a
good
time
and
i
must
say
i
have
generally
had
a
good
time
i
do
see
how
i
could
help
it
with
all
my
own
way
and
no
one
to
worry
i
was
sick
and
i
could
buy
any
thing
i
liked
and
all
that
so
i
had
a
good
time
i
read
of
girls
in
books
wishing
they
had
mothers
to
take
care
of
them
i
do
know
that
i
ever
wished
for
one
particularly
i
can
take
care
of
myself
i
must
say
too
that
i
do
think
some
mothers
are
much
of
an
institution
i
know
girls
who
have
them
and
they
are
always
worrying
he
laughed
in
spite
of
himself
and
though
she
had
been
speaking
with
the
utmost
seriousness
and
she
joined
him
when
they
ceased
she
returned
suddenly
to
the
charge
now
tell
me
what
i
have
done
this
afternoon
that
is
right
she
said
that
lucia
gaston
would
have
done
for
instance
i
say
that
because
i
should
mind
being
a
little
like
lucia
gaston
in
some
things
lucia
ought
to
feel
gratified
he
commented
she
does
she
answered
we
had
a
little
talk
about
it
and
she
was
as
pleased
as
could
be
i
did
think
of
it
in
that
way
until
i
saw
her
begin
to
blush
guess
what
she
said
i
am
afraid
i
ca
she
said
she
saw
so
many
things
to
envy
in
me
that
she
could
scarcely
believe
i
wanted
to
be
at
all
like
her
it
was
a
very
civil
speech
said
barold
ironically
i
scarcely
thought
lady
theobald
had
trained
her
so
well
she
meant
it
said
octavia
you
may
believe
it
but
she
did
i
know
when
people
mean
things
and
when
they
do
i
wish
i
did
said
barold
octavia
turned
her
attention
to
her
fan
well
i
am
waiting
she
said
waiting
he
repeated
to
be
told
of
my
faults
but
i
scarcely
see
of
what
importance
my
opinion
can
be
it
is
of
some
importance
to
me
just
now
the
last
two
words
rendered
him
really
impatient
and
it
may
be
spurred
him
up
if
we
are
to
take
lucia
gaston
as
a
model
he
said
lucia
gaston
would
possibly
not
have
been
so
complaisant
in
her
demeanor
toward
our
clerical
friend
complaisant
she
exclaimed
opening
her
lovely
eyes
when
i
was
actually
plunging
about
the
garden
trying
to
teach
him
to
play
well
i
should
call
that
being
complaisant
lucia
gaston
he
replied
would
not
say
that
she
had
been
about
the
garden
she
gave
herself
a
moment
for
reflection
that
true
she
remarked
when
it
was
over
she
would
when
i
compare
myself
with
the
slowbridge
girls
i
begin
to
think
i
must
say
some
pretty
awful
things
barold
made
no
reply
which
caused
her
to
laugh
a
little
again
you
dare
tell
me
she
said
now
do
i
well
i
do
think
i
want
to
know
very
particularly
what
lady
theobald
thinks
will
last
quite
a
good
while
complaisant
i
am
sorry
you
object
to
the
word
he
said
oh
i
do
she
answered
i
like
it
it
sounds
so
much
more
polite
than
to
say
i
was
flirting
and
being
fast
were
you
flirting
he
inquired
coldly
he
objected
to
her
ready
serenity
very
much
she
looked
a
little
puzzled
you
are
very
like
aunt
belinda
she
said
he
drew
himself
up
he
did
not
think
there
was
any
point
of
resemblance
at
all
between
miss
belinda
and
himself
she
went
on
without
observing
his
movement
you
think
every
thing
means
something
or
is
of
some
importance
you
said
that
just
as
aunt
belinda
says
will
they
think
it
never
occurs
to
me
that
they
think
at
all
gracious
why
should
they
you
will
find
they
do
he
said
well
she
said
glancing
at
the
group
gathered
under
the
just
now
aunt
belinda
thinks
we
had
better
go
over
to
her
so
suppose
we
do
it
at
any
rate
i
found
out
that
i
was
too
complaisant
to
mr
poppleton
when
the
party
separated
for
the
afternoon
barold
took
lucia
home
and
burmistone
and
the
curate
walked
down
the
street
together
poppleton
was
indeed
most
agreeably
exhilarated
his
expressive
little
countenance
beamed
with
delight
what
a
very
charming
person
miss
bassett
is
he
exclaimed
after
they
had
left
the
gate
what
a
very
charming
person
indeed
very
charming
said
burmistone
with
much
seriousness
a
prettier
young
person
i
certainly
have
never
seen
and
those
wonderful
gowns
of
hers
oh
interrupted
poppleton
with
natural
confusion
i
referred
to
miss
belinda
bassett
though
really
what
you
say
is
very
true
miss
octavia
bassett
indeed
i
think
in
fact
miss
octavia
bassett
is
one
might
almost
say
even
charming
than
her
aunt
yes
admitted
burmistone
perhaps
one
might
she
is
less
ripe
it
is
true
but
that
is
an
objection
time
will
remove
there
is
such
a
delightful
gayety
in
her
manner
said
poppleton
such
an
ingenuous
frankness
such
a
a
such
spirit
it
quite
carries
me
away
with
it
quite
he
walked
a
few
steps
thinking
over
this
delightful
gayety
and
ingenuous
frankness
and
then
burst
out
afresh
and
what
a
remarkable
life
she
has
had
too
she
actually
told
me
that
once
in
her
childhood
she
lived
for
months
in
a
camp
the
only
woman
there
she
says
the
men
were
kind
to
her
and
made
a
pet
of
her
she
has
known
the
most
extraordinary
people
in
the
mean
time
francis
barold
returned
lucia
to
lady
theobald
safe
keeping
having
done
so
he
made
his
adieus
and
left
the
two
to
themselves
her
ladyship
was
it
must
be
confessed
a
little
at
a
loss
to
explain
to
herself
what
she
saw
or
fancied
she
saw
in
the
manner
and
appearance
of
her
young
relative
she
was
persuaded
that
she
had
never
seen
lucia
look
as
she
looked
this
afternoon
she
had
a
brighter
color
in
her
cheeks
than
usual
her
pretty
figure
seemed
more
erect
her
eyes
had
a
spirit
in
them
which
was
quite
new
she
had
chatted
and
laughed
gayly
with
francis
barold
as
she
approached
the
house
and
after
his
departure
she
moved
to
and
fro
with
a
freedom
not
habitual
to
her
he
has
been
making
himself
agreeable
to
her
said
my
lady
with
grim
pleasure
he
can
do
it
if
he
chooses
and
he
is
just
the
man
to
please
a
girl
and
with
a
fine
domineering
air
how
did
you
enjoy
yourself
she
asked
very
much
said
lucia
never
more
thank
you
oh
ejaculated
my
lady
and
which
of
her
smart
new
york
gowns
did
miss
octavia
bassett
wear
they
were
at
the
and
instead
of
looking
down
at
her
soup
lucia
looked
quietly
and
steadily
across
the
table
at
her
grandmother
she
wore
a
very
pretty
one
she
said
it
was
pale
and
fitted
her
like
a
glove
she
made
me
feel
very
and
badly
dressed
lady
theobald
laid
down
her
spoon
she
made
you
feel
and
badly
dressed
you
yes
responded
lucia
she
always
does
i
wonder
what
she
thinks
of
the
things
we
wear
in
slowbridge
and
she
even
went
to
the
length
of
smiling
a
little
what
thinks
of
what
is
worn
in
slowbridge
lady
theobald
ejaculated
she
may
i
ask
what
weight
the
opinion
of
a
young
woman
from
america
from
nevada
is
supposed
to
have
in
slowbridge
lucia
took
a
spoonful
of
soup
in
a
leisurely
manner
i
do
think
it
is
supposed
to
have
any
but
but
i
do
think
she
minds
that
i
feel
as
if
i
should
if
i
were
in
her
place
i
have
always
thought
her
very
lucky
you
have
thought
her
lucky
cried
my
lady
you
have
envied
a
nevada
young
woman
who
dresses
like
an
actress
and
loads
herself
with
jewels
like
a
barbarian
a
girl
whose
conduct
toward
men
is
of
a
character
to
to
chill
one
blood
they
admire
her
said
lucia
simply
more
than
they
admire
lydia
egerton
and
more
than
they
admire
me
do
admire
her
demanded
my
lady
yes
grandmamma
replied
lucia
courageously
i
think
i
do
never
had
my
lady
been
so
astounded
in
her
life
for
a
moment
she
could
scarcely
speak
when
she
recovered
herself
she
pointed
to
the
door
go
to
your
room
she
commanded
this
is
american
freedom
of
speech
i
suppose
go
to
your
room
lucia
rose
obediently
she
could
not
help
wondering
what
her
course
would
be
if
she
had
the
hardihood
to
disregard
her
order
she
really
looked
quite
capable
of
carrying
it
out
forcibly
herself
when
the
girl
stood
at
her
bedroom
window
a
few
minutes
later
her
cheeks
were
burning
and
her
hands
trembling
i
am
afraid
it
was
very
badly
done
she
said
to
herself
i
am
sure
it
was
but
but
it
will
be
a
kind
of
practice
i
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
try
if
i
were
equal
to
it
that
i
did
seem
to
balance
things
quite
rightly
i
ought
to
have
waited
until
i
had
more
reason
to
speak
out
perhaps
there
was
enough
reason
then
and
i
was
more
aggressive
than
i
ought
to
have
been
octavia
is
never
aggressive
i
wonder
if
i
was
at
all
pert
i
do
think
octavia
ever
means
to
be
pert
i
felt
a
little
as
if
i
meant
to
be
pert
i
must
learn
to
balance
myself
and
only
be
cool
and
frank
then
she
looked
out
of
the
window
and
reflected
a
little
i
was
not
so
very
brave
after
all
she
said
rather
reluctantly
i
did
tell
her
burmistone
was
there
i
dare
have
done
that
i
am
afraid
i
sly
that
sounds
sly
i
am
sure
chapter
xviii
contrast
lady
theobald
will
put
a
stop
to
it
was
the
general
remark
it
will
certainly
not
occur
again
this
was
said
upon
the
evening
of
the
first
gathering
upon
miss
and
at
the
same
time
it
was
prophesied
that
francis
barold
would
soon
go
away
but
neither
of
the
prophecies
proved
true
francis
barold
did
return
to
london
and
strange
to
say
lucia
was
seen
again
and
again
playing
croquet
with
octavia
bassett
and
was
even
known
to
spend
evenings
with
her
perhaps
it
might
be
that
an
appeal
made
by
miss
belinda
to
her
ladyship
had
caused
her
to
allow
of
these
things
miss
belinda
had
in
fact
made
a
private
call
upon
my
lady
to
lay
her
case
before
her
i
feel
so
very
timid
about
every
thing
she
said
almost
with
tears
and
so
fearful
of
trusting
myself
that
i
really
find
it
quite
a
trial
the
dear
child
has
such
a
kind
heart
i
assure
you
she
has
a
kind
heart
dear
lady
theobald
and
is
so
innocent
of
any
intention
to
do
wrong
i
am
sure
she
is
innocent
that
it
seems
cruel
to
judge
her
severely
if
she
had
had
the
benefit
of
such
training
as
dear
lucia
i
am
convinced
that
her
conduct
would
have
been
most
exemplary
she
sees
herself
that
she
has
faults
i
am
sure
she
does
she
said
to
me
only
last
night
in
that
odd
way
of
hers
she
had
been
sitting
evidently
thinking
deeply
for
some
minutes
and
she
said
wonder
if
i
should
be
nicer
if
i
were
more
like
lucia
gaston
you
see
what
turn
her
mind
must
have
taken
she
admires
lucia
so
much
yesterday
evening
at
dinner
said
lady
theobald
severely
lucia
informed
me
that
admired
your
niece
the
feeling
seems
to
be
mutual
miss
belinda
colored
and
brightened
visibly
did
she
indeed
she
exclaimed
how
pleased
octavia
will
be
to
hear
it
did
she
indeed
then
warned
by
a
chilliness
and
lack
of
response
in
her
ladyship
manner
she
modified
her
delight
and
became
apologetic
again
these
young
people
are
more
are
less
critical
than
we
are
she
sighed
octavia
great
prettiness
i
think
lady
theobald
interposed
that
lucia
has
been
taught
to
feel
that
the
body
is
corruptible
and
subject
to
decay
and
that
mere
beauty
is
of
small
moment
miss
belinda
sighed
again
that
is
very
true
she
admitted
deprecatingly
very
true
indeed
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
octavia
stay
in
slowbridge
will
prove
beneficial
to
her
said
her
ladyship
in
her
most
judicial
manner
the
atmosphere
is
wholly
unlike
that
which
has
surrounded
her
during
her
previous
life
i
am
sure
it
will
prove
beneficial
to
her
said
miss
belinda
eagerly
the
companionship
of
and
refined
young
people
can
not
fail
to
be
of
use
to
her
such
a
companion
as
lucia
would
be
if
you
would
kindly
permit
her
to
spend
an
evening
with
us
now
and
then
would
certainly
improve
and
modify
her
greatly
francis
barold
is
is
i
think
of
the
same
opinion
at
least
i
fancied
i
gathered
as
much
from
a
few
words
he
let
fall
francis
barold
repeated
lady
theobald
and
what
did
francis
barold
say
of
course
it
was
but
very
little
hesitated
miss
belinda
but
but
i
could
not
help
seeing
that
he
was
drawing
comparisons
as
it
were
octavia
was
teaching
poppleton
to
play
croquet
and
she
was
rather
exhilarated
and
perhaps
exhibited
more
freedom
of
manner
in
an
innocent
way
quite
in
an
innocent
thoughtless
way
than
is
exactly
customary
and
i
saw
barold
glance
from
her
to
lucia
who
stood
near
and
when
i
said
are
thinking
of
the
contrast
between
them
he
answered
they
differ
very
greatly
it
is
true
and
of
course
i
knew
that
my
poor
octavia
could
not
have
the
advantage
in
his
eyes
she
feels
this
herself
i
know
she
shocked
me
the
other
day
beyond
expression
by
telling
me
that
she
had
asked
him
if
he
thought
she
was
really
fast
and
that
she
was
sure
he
did
poor
child
she
evidently
did
not
comprehend
the
dreadful
significance
of
such
terms
a
man
like
francis
barold
does
understand
their
significance
said
lady
theobald
and
it
is
to
be
deplored
that
your
niece
can
not
be
taught
what
her
position
in
society
will
be
if
such
a
reputation
attaches
itself
to
her
the
men
of
the
present
day
fight
shy
of
such
characters
this
dread
clause
so
impressed
poor
miss
belinda
by
its
solemnity
that
she
could
not
forbear
repeating
it
to
octavia
afterward
though
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
it
did
not
produce
the
effect
she
had
hoped
well
i
must
say
she
observed
that
if
some
men
fought
a
little
shyer
than
they
do
i
should
mind
it
you
always
have
about
half
a
dozen
dangling
around
who
only
bore
you
and
who
will
keep
asking
you
to
go
to
places
and
sending
you
bouquets
and
asking
you
to
dance
when
they
ca
dance
at
all
and
only
tear
your
dress
and
stand
on
your
feet
if
they
would
shy
it
would
be
splendid
to
miss
belinda
who
certainly
had
never
been
guilty
of
the
indecorum
of
having
any
member
of
the
stronger
sex
dangling
about
at
all
this
was
very
trying
my
dear
she
said
do
say
always
have
it
it
really
seems
to
make
it
so
personal
octavia
turned
around
and
fixed
her
eyes
wonderingly
upon
her
blushing
countenance
for
a
moment
she
made
no
remark
a
marvellous
thought
shaping
itself
slowly
in
her
mind
aunt
belinda
she
said
at
length
did
nobody
ever
ah
no
my
dear
no
no
i
assure
you
cried
miss
belinda
in
the
greatest
possible
trepidation
ah
dear
no
such
such
things
rarely
very
rarely
happen
in
slowbridge
and
besides
i
possibly
have
thought
of
it
i
could
indeed
she
was
so
overwhelmed
with
maidenly
confusion
at
the
appalling
thought
that
she
did
not
recover
herself
for
half
an
hour
at
least
octavia
feeling
that
it
would
not
be
safe
to
pursue
the
subject
only
uttered
one
word
of
comment
gracious
chapter
xix
an
experiment
much
to
her
own
astonishment
lucia
found
herself
allowed
new
liberty
she
was
permitted
to
spend
the
afternoon
frequently
with
octavia
and
on
several
occasions
that
young
lady
and
miss
bassett
were
invited
to
partake
of
tea
at
oldclough
in
company
with
no
other
guest
than
francis
barold
i
do
know
what
it
means
and
i
think
it
must
mean
something
said
lucia
to
octavia
but
it
is
very
pleasant
i
never
was
allowed
to
be
so
intimate
with
any
one
before
perhaps
suggested
octavia
sagely
she
thinks
that
if
you
see
me
often
enough
you
will
get
sick
of
me
and
it
will
be
a
lesson
to
you
the
more
i
see
of
you
answered
lucia
with
a
serious
little
air
the
fonder
i
am
of
you
i
understand
you
better
you
are
not
at
all
like
what
i
thought
you
at
first
octavia
but
i
do
know
that
there
much
to
understand
in
me
there
is
a
great
deal
to
understand
in
you
she
replied
you
are
a
puzzle
to
me
often
you
seem
so
frank
and
yet
one
knows
so
little
about
you
after
all
for
instance
lucia
went
on
who
would
imagine
that
you
are
so
affectionate
am
i
affectionate
she
asked
yes
answered
lucia
i
am
sure
you
are
very
affectionate
i
have
found
it
out
gradually
you
would
suffer
things
for
any
one
you
loved
octavia
thought
the
matter
over
yes
she
said
at
length
i
would
you
are
very
fond
of
miss
bassett
proceeded
lucia
as
if
arraigning
her
at
the
bar
of
justice
you
are
fond
of
your
father
and
i
am
sure
there
are
other
people
you
are
very
fond
of
fond
of
indeed
octavia
pondered
seriously
again
yes
there
are
she
remarked
but
no
one
would
care
about
them
here
and
so
i
not
going
to
make
a
fuss
you
do
want
to
make
a
fuss
over
people
you
do
said
lucia
you
are
like
francis
barold
in
one
way
but
you
are
altogether
different
in
another
francis
barold
does
not
wish
to
show
emotion
and
he
is
so
determined
to
hedge
himself
around
that
one
ca
help
suspecting
that
he
is
always
guarding
himself
against
one
he
seems
always
to
be
resenting
any
interference
but
you
do
not
appear
to
care
at
all
and
so
it
is
not
natural
that
one
should
suspect
you
i
did
not
suspect
you
what
do
you
suspect
me
of
now
of
thinking
a
great
deal
answered
lucia
affectionately
and
of
being
very
clever
and
very
good
octavia
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
i
think
she
said
after
the
pause
i
think
you
find
out
that
a
mistake
no
i
shall
not
returned
lucia
quite
glowing
with
enthusiasm
and
i
know
i
shall
learn
a
great
deal
from
you
this
was
such
a
startling
proposition
that
octavia
felt
decidedly
uncomfortable
she
flushed
rosy
red
i
the
one
who
ought
to
learn
things
i
think
she
said
i
always
doing
things
that
frighten
aunt
belinda
and
you
know
how
the
rest
regard
me
octavia
said
lucia
very
naively
indeed
suppose
we
try
to
help
each
other
if
you
will
tell
me
when
i
am
wrong
i
will
try
to
to
have
the
courage
to
tell
you
that
will
be
good
practice
for
me
what
i
want
most
is
courage
and
frankness
and
i
am
sure
it
will
take
courage
to
make
up
my
mind
to
tell
you
of
your
of
your
mistakes
octavia
regarded
her
with
mingled
admiration
and
respect
i
think
that
a
splendid
idea
she
said
are
you
sure
faltered
lucia
are
you
sure
you
wo
mind
the
things
i
may
have
to
say
really
they
are
quite
little
things
in
themselves
hardly
worth
mentioning
tell
me
one
of
them
right
now
said
octavia
oh
no
exclaimed
lucia
starting
i
rather
not
just
now
well
commented
octavia
that
sounds
as
if
they
must
be
pretty
unpleasant
why
do
you
want
to
they
will
be
quite
as
bad
and
to
refuse
to
tell
me
one
is
a
bad
beginning
it
looks
as
if
you
were
frightened
and
it
is
good
practice
for
you
to
be
frightened
at
such
a
little
thing
lucia
felt
convicted
she
made
an
effort
to
regain
her
composure
no
it
is
not
she
said
but
that
is
always
the
way
i
am
continually
telling
myself
that
i
be
courageous
and
candid
and
the
first
time
any
thing
happens
i
fail
i
tell
you
one
thing
she
stopped
short
here
and
looked
at
octavia
guiltily
it
is
something
i
think
i
would
do
if
if
i
were
in
your
place
lucia
stammered
a
very
little
thing
indeed
well
remarked
octavia
anxiously
lucia
lost
her
breath
caught
it
again
and
proceeded
cautiously
and
with
blushes
at
her
own
daring
if
i
were
in
your
place
she
said
i
think
that
perhaps
only
perhaps
you
know
i
would
not
wear
my
hair
so
low
down
over
my
forehead
octavia
sprang
from
her
seat
and
ran
to
the
over
the
mantle
she
glanced
at
the
reflection
of
her
own
startled
pretty
face
and
then
putting
her
hand
up
to
the
soft
blonde
bang
which
met
her
brows
turned
to
lucia
is
it
becoming
she
asked
breathlessly
oh
yes
lucia
answered
very
octavia
started
then
why
would
you
wear
it
she
cried
what
do
you
mean
lucia
felt
her
position
truly
a
delicate
one
she
locked
her
hands
and
braced
herself
but
she
blushed
vividly
it
may
sound
rather
silly
when
i
tell
you
why
octavia
she
said
but
i
really
do
think
it
is
a
sort
of
reason
you
know
in
those
absurd
pictures
of
actresses
bangs
always
seem
to
be
the
principal
feature
i
saw
some
in
the
when
i
went
to
harriford
with
grandmamma
and
they
were
such
dreadful
women
some
of
them
and
had
so
very
few
clothes
on
that
i
ca
help
thinking
i
should
like
to
look
like
them
and
does
it
make
me
look
like
them
oh
very
little
answered
lucia
very
little
indeed
of
course
but
but
it
the
same
thing
after
all
put
in
octavia
that
what
you
mean
it
is
so
very
little
faltered
lucia
that
that
perhaps
it
a
reason
octavia
looked
at
herself
in
the
glass
again
it
is
a
very
good
reason
she
remarked
but
i
suppose
it
will
do
she
paused
and
looked
lucia
in
the
face
i
do
think
that
a
little
thing
she
said
to
be
told
you
look
like
an
actress
i
did
not
mean
to
say
so
cried
lucia
filled
with
the
most
poignant
distress
i
beg
your
pardon
indeed
i
oh
dear
i
was
afraid
you
would
like
it
i
felt
that
it
was
taking
a
great
liberty
i
do
like
it
answered
octavia
but
that
ca
be
helped
i
exactly
suppose
i
should
but
i
was
going
to
say
any
thing
about
hair
when
began
glancing
at
poor
lucia
coiffure
though
i
suppose
i
might
you
might
say
a
thousand
things
about
it
cried
lucia
piteously
i
know
that
mine
is
not
only
in
bad
taste
but
it
is
ugly
and
unbecoming
yes
said
octavia
cruelly
it
is
and
yours
is
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
protested
lucia
you
know
i
told
you
it
was
pretty
octavia
octavia
walked
over
to
the
table
upon
which
stood
miss
and
took
therefrom
a
small
and
gleaming
pair
of
scissors
returning
to
the
with
them
how
short
shall
i
cut
it
she
demanded
oh
exclaimed
lucia
do
do
for
answer
octavia
raised
the
scissors
and
gave
a
snip
it
was
a
savage
snip
and
half
the
length
and
width
of
her
fell
on
the
mantle
then
she
gave
another
snip
and
the
other
half
fell
lucia
scarcely
dared
to
breathe
for
a
moment
octavia
stood
gazing
at
herself
with
pale
face
and
dilated
eyes
then
suddenly
the
folly
of
the
deed
she
had
done
seemed
to
reveal
itself
to
her
oh
she
cried
out
oh
how
diabolical
it
looks
she
turned
upon
lucia
why
did
you
make
me
do
it
she
exclaimed
it
all
your
fault
every
bit
of
it
and
flinging
the
scissors
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
she
threw
herself
into
a
chair
and
burst
into
tears
lucia
anguish
of
mind
was
almost
more
than
she
could
bear
for
at
least
three
minutes
she
felt
herself
a
criminal
of
the
deepest
dye
after
the
three
minutes
had
elapsed
however
she
began
to
reason
and
called
to
mind
the
fact
that
she
was
failing
as
usual
under
her
crisis
this
is
being
a
coward
again
she
said
to
herself
it
is
worse
than
to
have
said
nothing
it
is
true
that
she
will
look
more
refined
now
one
can
see
a
little
of
her
forehead
and
it
is
cowardly
to
be
afraid
to
stand
firm
when
i
really
think
so
i
yes
i
will
say
something
to
her
octavia
she
began
aloud
i
am
sure
you
are
making
a
mistake
again
this
as
decidedly
as
possible
which
was
not
very
decidedly
you
you
look
very
much
nicer
i
look
said
octavia
who
began
to
feel
rather
absurd
you
do
not
your
forehead
you
have
the
prettiest
forehead
i
ever
saw
octavia
said
lucia
eagerly
and
your
eyebrows
are
perfect
i
wish
you
would
look
at
yourself
again
rather
to
her
surprise
octavia
began
to
laugh
under
cover
of
her
handkerchief
reaction
had
set
in
and
though
the
laugh
was
a
trifle
hysterical
it
was
still
a
laugh
next
she
gave
her
eyes
a
final
little
dab
and
rose
to
go
to
the
glass
again
she
looked
at
herself
touched
up
the
short
waving
fringe
left
on
her
forehead
and
turned
to
lucia
with
a
resigned
expression
do
you
think
that
any
one
who
was
used
to
seeing
it
the
other
way
would
would
think
i
looked
horrid
she
inquired
anxiously
they
would
think
you
prettier
a
great
deal
lucia
answered
earnestly
do
you
know
octavia
that
nothing
could
be
really
unbecoming
to
you
you
have
that
kind
of
face
for
a
few
seconds
octavia
seemed
to
lose
herself
in
thought
of
a
speculative
nature
jack
always
said
so
she
remarked
at
length
jack
repeated
lucia
timidly
octavia
roused
herself
and
smiled
with
candid
sweetness
he
is
some
one
i
knew
in
nevada
she
explained
he
worked
in
mine
once
you
must
have
known
him
very
well
suggested
lucia
somewhat
awed
i
did
she
replied
calmly
very
well
she
tucked
away
her
in
the
jaunty
pocket
at
the
back
of
her
basque
and
returned
to
her
chair
then
she
turned
again
to
lucia
well
she
said
i
think
you
have
found
out
that
you
mistaken
have
you
dear
suppose
you
tell
me
of
something
else
lucia
colored
no
she
answered
that
is
enough
for
chapter
xx
peculiar
to
nevada
whether
or
not
lucia
was
right
in
accusing
octavia
bassett
of
being
clever
and
thinking
a
great
deal
is
a
riddle
which
those
who
are
interested
in
her
must
unravel
as
they
read
but
whether
the
surmise
was
correct
or
incorrect
it
seemed
possible
that
she
had
thought
a
little
after
the
interview
when
barold
saw
her
next
he
was
struck
by
a
slight
but
distinctly
definable
change
he
recognized
in
her
dress
and
coiffure
her
pretty
hair
had
a
rather
less
professional
appearance
he
had
the
pleasure
of
observing
for
the
first
time
how
very
white
her
forehead
was
and
how
delicate
the
arch
of
her
eyebrows
her
dress
had
a
novel
air
of
simplicity
and
the
diamond
rings
were
nowhere
to
be
seen
she
better
dressed
than
usual
he
said
to
himself
and
she
always
well
dressed
rather
too
well
dressed
fact
is
for
a
place
like
this
this
sort
of
thing
is
in
better
form
under
the
circumstances
it
was
so
much
better
form
and
he
so
far
approved
of
it
that
he
quite
thawed
and
was
very
amiable
and
very
entertaining
indeed
octavia
was
entertaining
too
she
asked
several
most
interesting
questions
do
you
think
she
inquired
that
it
is
bad
taste
to
wear
diamonds
my
mother
wears
them
occasionally
have
you
any
sisters
no
any
cousins
as
young
as
i
am
do
they
wear
them
i
must
admit
he
replied
that
they
do
in
the
first
place
you
know
they
have
any
and
in
the
second
i
am
under
the
impression
that
lady
beauchamp
their
mamma
you
know
would
permit
it
if
they
had
would
permit
it
said
octavia
i
suppose
they
always
do
as
she
tells
them
he
smiled
a
little
they
would
be
very
courageous
young
women
if
they
did
he
remarked
what
would
she
do
if
they
tried
it
she
inquired
she
could
beat
them
they
will
never
try
it
he
answered
dryly
and
though
i
have
never
seen
her
beat
them
or
heard
their
lamentations
under
chastisement
i
should
not
like
to
say
that
lady
beauchamp
could
not
do
any
thing
she
is
a
very
determined
person
for
a
gentlewoman
octavia
laughed
you
are
joking
she
said
lady
beauchamp
is
a
serious
subject
for
jokes
he
responded
my
cousins
think
so
at
least
i
wonder
if
she
is
as
bad
as
lady
theobald
octavia
reflected
aloud
she
says
i
have
no
right
to
wear
diamonds
at
all
until
i
am
married
but
i
do
mind
lady
theobald
she
added
as
a
cheerful
afterthought
i
am
not
fond
enough
of
her
to
care
about
what
she
says
are
you
fond
of
any
one
barold
inquired
speaking
with
a
languid
air
but
at
the
same
time
glancing
at
her
with
some
slight
interest
from
under
his
eyelids
lucia
says
i
am
she
returned
with
the
calmness
of
a
young
person
who
wished
to
regard
the
matter
from
an
unembarrassed
point
of
view
lucia
says
i
am
affectionate
ah
deliberately
are
you
she
turned
and
looked
at
him
serenely
should
think
so
she
asked
this
was
making
such
a
personal
matter
of
the
question
that
he
did
not
exactly
enjoy
it
it
was
certainly
not
good
form
to
pull
a
man
up
in
such
cool
style
really
he
replied
i
ah
have
had
no
opportunity
of
judging
he
had
not
the
slightest
intention
of
being
amusing
but
to
his
infinite
disgust
he
discovered
as
soon
as
he
spoke
that
she
was
amused
she
laughed
outright
and
evidently
only
checked
herself
because
he
looked
so
furious
in
consideration
for
his
feelings
she
assumed
an
air
of
mild
but
preternatural
seriousness
no
she
remarked
that
is
true
you
have
of
course
he
was
silent
he
did
not
enjoy
being
amusing
at
all
and
he
made
no
pretence
of
appearing
to
submit
to
the
indignity
calmly
she
bent
forward
a
little
ah
she
exclaimed
you
are
mad
again
i
mean
you
are
vexed
i
am
always
vexing
you
there
was
a
hint
of
appeal
in
her
voice
which
rather
pleased
him
but
he
had
no
intention
of
relenting
at
once
i
confess
i
am
at
a
loss
to
know
why
you
laughed
he
said
are
you
she
asked
really
letting
her
eyes
rest
upon
him
anxiously
for
a
moment
then
she
actually
gave
vent
to
a
little
sigh
we
look
at
things
so
differently
that
it
she
said
i
suppose
it
is
he
responded
still
chillingly
in
spite
of
this
she
suddenly
assumed
a
comparatively
cheerful
aspect
a
happy
thought
occurred
to
her
lucia
would
beg
your
pardon
she
said
i
am
learning
good
manners
from
lucia
suppose
i
beg
your
pardon
it
is
quite
unnecessary
he
replied
lucia
would
think
so
she
said
and
why
should
i
be
as
as
lucia
i
beg
your
pardon
he
felt
rather
absurd
and
yet
somewhat
mollified
she
had
a
way
of
looking
at
him
sometimes
when
she
had
been
unpleasant
which
rather
soothed
him
in
fact
he
had
found
of
late
a
little
to
his
private
annoyance
that
it
was
very
easy
for
her
either
to
soothe
or
disturb
him
and
now
just
as
octavia
had
settled
down
into
one
of
the
prettiest
and
least
difficult
of
her
moods
there
came
a
knock
at
the
front
door
which
being
answered
by
mary
anne
was
found
to
announce
the
curate
of
james
enter
consequently
the
rev
arthur
poppleton
blushing
a
trifle
timorous
perhaps
but
happy
beyond
measure
to
find
himself
in
miss
belinda
parlor
again
with
miss
belinda
niece
perhaps
the
least
possible
shade
of
his
joyousness
died
out
when
he
caught
sight
of
francis
barold
and
certainly
francis
barold
was
not
at
all
delighted
to
see
him
what
does
the
fellow
want
that
gentleman
was
saying
inwardly
what
does
he
come
simpering
and
turning
pink
here
for
why
does
he
go
and
see
some
of
his
old
women
and
read
tracts
to
them
that
business
octavia
manner
toward
her
visitor
formed
a
fresh
grievance
for
barold
she
treated
the
curate
very
well
indeed
she
seemed
glad
to
see
him
she
was
wholly
at
her
ease
with
him
she
made
no
trying
remarks
to
him
she
never
stopped
to
fix
her
eyes
upon
him
in
that
inexplicable
style
and
she
did
not
laugh
when
there
seemed
nothing
to
laugh
at
she
was
so
gay
and
that
the
rev
arthur
poppleton
beamed
and
flourished
under
her
treatment
and
forgot
to
change
color
and
even
ventured
to
talk
a
good
deal
and
make
divers
quite
presentable
little
jokes
i
should
like
to
know
thought
barold
growing
sulkier
as
the
others
grew
merrier
i
should
like
to
know
what
she
finds
so
interesting
in
him
and
why
she
chooses
to
treat
him
better
than
she
treats
me
for
she
certainly
does
treat
him
better
it
was
hardly
fair
however
that
he
should
complain
for
at
times
he
was
treated
extremely
well
and
his
intimacy
with
octavia
progressed
quite
rapidly
perhaps
if
the
truth
were
told
it
was
always
himself
who
was
the
first
means
of
checking
it
by
some
suddenly
prudent
instinct
which
led
him
to
feel
that
perhaps
he
was
in
rather
a
delicate
position
and
had
better
not
indulge
in
too
much
of
a
good
thing
he
had
not
been
an
eligible
and
unimpeachable
desirable
for
ten
years
without
acquiring
some
of
that
discretion
which
is
said
to
be
the
better
part
of
valor
the
air
with
which
octavia
accepted
his
attentions
caused
him
to
pull
himself
up
sometimes
if
he
had
been
brown
or
jones
or
even
robinson
she
could
not
have
appeared
to
regard
them
as
more
entirely
natural
when
he
had
gone
so
far
once
or
twice
he
had
deigned
to
make
a
more
than
usually
agreeable
speech
to
her
it
was
received
with
none
of
that
charming
sensitive
tremor
to
which
he
was
accustomed
octavia
neither
blushed
nor
dropped
her
eyes
it
did
not
add
to
barold
satisfaction
to
find
her
as
cheerful
and
ready
to
be
amused
by
a
mild
little
curate
who
blushed
and
stammered
and
was
neither
brilliant
graceful
nor
distinguished
could
not
octavia
see
the
wide
difference
between
the
two
regarding
the
matter
in
this
light
and
watching
octavia
as
she
encouraged
her
visitor
and
laughed
at
his
jokes
and
never
once
tripped
him
up
by
asking
him
a
startling
question
did
not
as
already
has
been
said
improve
francis
barold
temper
and
by
the
time
his
visit
was
over
he
had
lapsed
into
his
coldest
and
most
haughty
manner
as
soon
as
miss
belinda
entered
and
engaged
poppleton
for
a
moment
he
rose
and
crossed
the
little
room
to
side
i
must
bid
you
he
said
octavia
did
not
rise
sit
down
a
minute
while
aunt
belinda
is
talking
about
nightcaps
and
lumbago
she
said
i
wanted
to
ask
you
something
by
the
way
what
lumbago
is
that
what
you
wished
to
ask
me
he
inquired
stiffly
no
i
just
thought
of
that
have
you
ever
had
it
and
what
is
it
like
all
the
old
people
in
slowbridge
have
it
and
they
tell
you
all
about
it
when
you
go
to
see
them
aunt
belinda
says
so
what
i
wanted
to
ask
you
was
different
possibly
miss
bassett
might
be
able
to
tell
you
he
remarked
about
the
lumbago
well
perhaps
she
might
i
ask
her
do
you
think
it
bad
taste
in
to
wear
diamonds
she
said
this
with
the
most
delightful
seriousness
fixing
her
eyes
upon
him
with
her
very
prettiest
look
of
candid
appeal
as
if
it
were
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
that
she
should
apply
to
him
for
information
he
felt
himself
faltering
again
how
white
that
bit
of
forehead
was
how
soft
that
blonde
waving
fringe
of
hair
what
a
lovely
shape
her
eyes
were
and
how
large
and
clear
as
she
raised
them
why
do
you
ask
he
inquired
because
i
think
you
are
an
unprejudiced
person
lady
theobald
is
not
i
have
confidence
in
you
tell
me
there
was
a
slight
pause
really
he
said
after
it
i
can
scarcely
believe
that
my
opinion
can
be
of
any
value
in
your
eyes
i
am
can
only
tell
you
that
it
is
hardly
customary
in
an
in
england
for
young
people
to
wear
a
profusion
of
ornament
i
wonder
if
i
wear
a
profusion
you
do
need
any
he
condescended
you
are
too
young
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
she
glanced
down
at
her
slim
unringed
hands
for
a
moment
her
expression
quite
thoughtful
lucia
and
i
almost
quarrelled
the
other
day
she
said
at
least
i
almost
quarrelled
it
is
so
nice
to
be
told
of
things
after
all
i
must
say
i
do
like
it
as
much
as
i
thought
i
should
he
kept
his
seat
longer
than
he
had
intended
and
when
he
rose
to
go
the
rev
arthur
poppleton
was
shaking
hands
with
miss
belinda
and
so
it
fell
out
that
they
left
the
house
together
you
know
miss
octavia
bassett
well
i
suppose
remarked
barold
with
condescension
as
they
passed
through
the
gate
you
clergymen
are
fortunate
fellows
i
wish
that
others
knew
her
as
well
sir
said
the
little
gentleman
kindling
i
wish
they
knew
her
her
generosity
and
kindness
of
heart
and
ready
sympathy
with
misfortune
ah
commented
barold
twisting
his
mustache
with
somewhat
of
an
incredulous
air
this
was
not
at
all
the
sort
of
thing
he
had
expected
to
hear
for
his
own
part
it
would
not
have
occurred
to
him
to
suspect
her
of
the
possession
of
such
desirable
and
orthodox
qualities
there
are
those
who
misunderstand
her
cried
the
curate
warming
with
his
subject
who
misunderstand
and
yes
and
apply
harsh
terms
to
her
innocent
gayety
and
freedom
of
speech
if
they
knew
her
as
i
do
they
would
cease
to
do
so
i
should
scarcely
have
thought
began
barold
there
are
many
who
scarcely
think
it
if
you
will
pardon
my
interrupting
you
said
the
curate
i
think
they
would
scarcely
believe
it
if
i
felt
at
liberty
to
tell
them
which
i
regret
to
say
i
do
not
i
am
almost
breaking
my
word
in
saying
what
i
can
not
help
saying
to
yourself
the
poor
under
my
care
are
better
off
since
she
came
and
there
are
some
who
have
seen
her
more
than
once
though
she
did
not
go
as
a
teacher
or
to
reprove
them
for
faults
and
her
way
of
doing
what
she
did
was
new
to
them
and
perhaps
much
less
serious
than
they
were
accustomed
to
and
they
liked
it
all
the
better
ah
commented
barold
again
flannel
and
that
sort
of
thing
no
with
much
spirit
not
at
all
sir
but
what
as
i
said
they
liked
much
better
it
is
not
often
they
meet
a
beautiful
creature
who
comes
among
them
with
open
hands
and
the
natural
ungrudging
way
of
giving
which
she
has
sometimes
they
are
at
a
loss
to
understand
as
well
as
the
rest
they
have
been
used
to
what
is
narrower
and
more
more
exacting
they
have
been
used
to
lady
theobald
observed
barold
with
a
faint
smile
it
would
not
become
me
to
to
mention
lady
theobald
in
any
disparaging
manner
replied
the
curate
but
the
best
and
most
charitable
among
us
do
not
always
carry
out
our
good
intentions
in
the
best
way
i
dare
say
lady
theobald
would
consider
miss
octavia
bassett
too
readily
influenced
and
too
lavish
she
is
as
generous
with
her
money
as
with
her
diamonds
perhaps
said
barold
possibly
the
quality
is
peculiar
to
nevada
we
part
here
poppleton
i
believe
chapter
xxi
lord
lansdowne
one
morning
in
the
following
week
burnham
attired
herself
in
her
black
silk
and
leaving
the
misses
burnham
practising
diligently
turned
her
steps
toward
oldclough
hall
arriving
there
she
was
ushered
into
the
blue
by
dobson
in
his
character
of
footman
and
in
a
few
minutes
lucia
appeared
when
burnham
saw
her
she
assumed
a
slight
air
of
surprise
why
my
dear
she
said
as
she
shook
hands
i
should
scarcely
have
known
you
and
though
this
was
something
of
an
exaggeration
there
was
some
excuse
for
the
exclamation
lucia
was
looking
very
charming
and
several
changes
might
be
noted
in
her
attire
and
appearance
the
ugly
twist
had
disappeared
from
her
delicate
head
and
in
its
place
were
soft
loose
waves
and
light
puffs
she
had
even
ventured
on
allowing
a
few
ringed
locks
to
stray
on
to
her
forehead
her
white
no
longer
wore
the
of
miss
chickie
but
had
been
remodelled
by
some
one
of
more
taste
what
a
pretty
gown
my
dear
said
burnham
glancing
at
it
curiously
a
watteau
plait
down
the
back
is
it
a
watteau
plait
and
little
ruffles
down
the
front
and
pale
pink
bows
it
is
quite
like
some
of
miss
octavia
bassett
dresses
only
not
so
i
do
not
think
octavia
dresses
would
seem
if
she
wore
them
in
london
or
paris
said
lucia
bravely
it
is
only
because
we
are
so
very
quiet
and
dress
so
little
in
slowbridge
that
they
seem
so
and
your
hair
remarked
burnham
you
drew
your
idea
of
that
from
some
style
of
hers
i
suppose
very
becoming
indeed
well
well
and
how
does
lady
theobald
like
all
this
my
dear
i
am
not
sure
that
lucia
was
beginning
when
her
ladyship
interrupted
her
by
entering
my
dear
lady
theobald
cried
her
visitor
rising
i
hope
you
are
well
i
have
just
been
complimenting
lucia
upon
her
pretty
dress
and
her
new
style
of
dressing
her
hair
miss
octavia
bassett
has
been
giving
her
the
benefit
of
her
experience
it
appears
we
have
not
been
doing
her
justice
who
would
have
believed
that
she
had
come
from
nevada
to
improve
us
miss
octavia
bassett
said
my
lady
sonorously
has
come
from
nevada
to
teach
our
young
people
a
great
many
things
new
fashions
in
duty
and
demeanor
and
respect
for
their
elders
let
us
hope
they
will
be
benefited
if
you
will
excuse
me
grandmamma
said
lucia
speaking
in
a
soft
steady
voice
i
will
go
and
write
the
letters
you
wished
written
go
said
my
lady
with
majesty
and
having
bidden
burnham
lucia
went
if
burnham
had
expected
any
explanation
of
her
ladyship
evident
displeasure
she
was
doomed
to
disappointment
that
excellent
and
rigorous
gentlewoman
had
a
stern
sense
of
dignity
which
forbade
her
condescending
to
the
confidential
weakness
of
mere
ordinary
mortals
instead
of
referring
to
lucia
she
broached
a
more
commonplace
topic
i
hope
your
rheumatism
does
not
threaten
you
again
burnham
she
remarked
i
am
very
well
thank
you
my
dear
said
burnham
so
well
that
i
am
thinking
quite
seriously
of
taking
the
dear
girls
to
the
when
it
comes
off
to
the
repeated
her
ladyship
may
i
ask
who
thinks
of
giving
a
in
slowbridge
it
is
no
one
in
slowbridge
replied
this
lady
cheerfully
some
one
who
lives
a
little
out
of
slowbridge
burmistone
my
dear
lady
theobald
at
his
new
place
mr
burmistone
yes
my
dear
and
a
most
charming
affair
it
is
to
be
if
we
are
to
believe
all
we
hear
surely
you
have
heard
something
of
it
from
mr
barold
barold
has
not
been
to
oldclough
for
several
days
then
he
will
tell
you
when
he
comes
for
i
suppose
he
has
as
much
to
do
with
it
as
mr
burmistone
i
have
heard
before
announced
my
lady
of
men
of
class
securing
the
services
of
persons
of
established
position
in
society
when
they
wished
to
spend
their
money
upon
entertainments
but
i
should
scarcely
have
imagined
that
francis
barold
would
have
allowed
himself
to
be
made
a
party
to
such
a
transaction
but
put
in
burnham
rather
eagerly
it
appears
that
burmistone
is
not
such
an
obscure
person
after
all
he
is
an
oxford
man
and
came
off
with
honors
he
is
quite
a
man
and
gives
this
entertainment
in
honor
of
his
friend
and
relation
lord
lansdowne
lord
lansdowne
echoed
her
ladyship
sternly
son
of
the
marquis
of
lauderdale
whose
wife
was
lady
honora
erroll
did
burmistone
give
you
this
information
asked
lady
theobald
with
ironic
calmness
burnham
colored
never
so
faintly
i
that
is
to
say
there
is
a
sort
of
acquaintance
between
one
of
my
maids
and
the
butler
at
the
burmistone
place
and
when
the
girl
was
doing
lydia
hair
she
told
her
the
story
lord
lansdowne
and
his
father
are
quite
fond
of
burmistone
it
is
said
it
seems
rather
singular
to
my
mind
that
we
should
not
have
known
of
this
before
but
how
should
we
learn
we
none
of
us
know
lord
lansdowne
or
even
the
marquis
i
think
he
is
only
a
second
or
third
cousin
we
are
a
little
just
a
little
in
slowbridge
you
know
my
dear
at
least
i
have
thought
so
sometimes
lately
i
must
confess
remarked
my
lady
that
have
not
regarded
the
matter
in
that
light
that
is
because
you
have
a
better
right
to
to
be
a
little
set
than
the
rest
of
us
was
the
amiable
response
lady
theobald
did
not
disclaim
the
privilege
she
felt
the
sentiment
an
extremely
correct
one
but
she
was
not
very
warm
in
her
manner
during
the
remainder
of
the
call
and
incongruous
as
such
a
statement
may
appear
it
must
be
confessed
that
she
felt
that
miss
octavia
bassett
must
have
something
to
do
with
these
defections
on
all
sides
and
that
and
all
such
swervings
from
established
slowbridge
custom
were
the
natural
result
of
nevada
frivolity
and
freedom
of
manners
it
may
be
that
she
felt
remotely
that
even
lord
lansdowne
and
the
marquis
of
lauderdale
were
to
be
referred
to
the
same
reprehensible
cause
and
that
but
for
octavia
bassett
burmistone
would
not
have
been
educated
at
oxford
and
have
come
off
with
honors
and
have
turned
out
to
be
related
to
respectable
people
but
would
have
remained
in
appropriate
obscurity
i
suppose
she
said
afterward
to
lucia
that
your
friend
miss
octavia
bassett
is
in
burmistone
confidence
if
no
one
else
has
been
permitted
to
have
that
honor
i
have
no
doubt
has
known
of
this
approaching
entertainment
for
some
weeks
i
do
not
know
grandmamma
replied
lucia
putting
her
letters
together
and
gaining
color
as
she
bent
over
them
she
was
wondering
with
inward
trepidation
what
her
ladyship
would
say
if
she
knew
the
whole
truth
if
she
knew
that
it
was
her
granddaughter
and
not
octavia
bassett
who
enjoyed
burmistone
confidence
ah
she
thought
how
could
i
ever
dare
to
tell
her
the
same
day
francis
barold
sauntered
up
to
pay
them
a
visit
and
then
as
burnham
had
prophesied
lady
theobald
heard
all
she
wished
to
hear
and
indeed
a
great
deal
more
what
is
this
i
am
told
of
burmistone
francis
she
inquired
that
he
intends
to
give
a
and
that
lord
lansdowne
is
to
be
one
of
the
guests
and
that
he
has
caused
it
to
be
circulated
that
they
are
cousins
that
lansdowne
has
caused
it
to
be
circulated
or
burmistone
it
is
scarcely
likely
that
lord
lansdowne
beg
pardon
he
interrupted
fixing
his
single
glass
dexterously
in
his
right
eye
and
gazing
at
her
ladyship
through
it
ca
see
why
lansdowne
should
object
fact
is
he
is
a
great
deal
fonder
of
burmistone
than
relations
usually
are
of
each
other
now
i
often
find
that
kind
of
thing
a
bore
but
lansdowne
does
seem
to
they
were
at
school
together
it
seems
and
at
oxford
too
and
burmistone
is
supposed
to
have
behaved
pretty
well
towards
lansdowne
at
one
time
when
he
was
rather
a
wild
fellow
so
the
father
and
mother
say
as
to
burmistone
it
to
be
circulated
that
sort
of
thing
is
rather
absurd
the
man
is
a
cad
you
know
pray
do
say
know
francis
said
her
ladyship
i
know
very
little
but
what
i
have
chanced
to
see
and
i
must
confess
i
have
not
been
prepossessed
in
burmistone
favor
why
did
he
not
choose
to
inform
us
that
he
was
lord
lansdowne
second
cousin
and
knew
the
marquis
of
lauderdale
grandmamma
broke
in
lucia
with
very
pretty
spirit
would
that
have
prepossessed
you
in
his
favor
would
you
have
forgiven
him
for
building
the
mills
on
lord
lansdowne
account
i
i
wish
i
was
related
to
a
marquis
which
was
very
bold
indeed
may
i
ask
said
her
ladyship
in
her
most
monumental
manner
when
became
burmistone
champion
chapter
xxii
you
have
made
it
livelier
when
she
had
become
burmistone
champion
indeed
she
could
scarcely
have
told
when
unless
perhaps
she
had
fixed
the
date
at
the
first
time
she
had
heard
his
name
introduced
at
a
high
tea
with
every
politely
opprobrious
epithet
affixed
she
had
defended
him
in
her
own
mind
then
and
felt
sure
that
he
deserved
very
little
that
was
said
against
him
and
very
likely
nothing
at
all
and
the
first
time
she
had
seen
and
spoken
to
him
she
had
been
convinced
that
she
had
not
made
a
mistake
and
that
he
had
been
treated
with
cruel
injustice
how
kind
he
was
how
manly
how
clever
and
how
well
he
bore
himself
under
the
popular
adverse
criticism
she
only
wondered
that
anybody
could
be
so
blind
and
stupid
and
wilful
as
to
assail
him
and
if
this
had
been
the
case
in
those
early
days
imagine
what
she
felt
now
when
ah
well
when
her
friendship
had
had
time
and
opportunity
to
become
a
much
deeper
sentiment
must
it
be
confessed
that
she
had
seen
burmistone
even
oftener
than
octavia
and
miss
belinda
knew
of
of
course
it
had
all
been
quite
accidental
but
it
had
happened
that
now
and
then
when
she
had
been
taking
a
quiet
walk
in
the
lanes
about
oldclough
she
had
encountered
a
gentleman
who
had
dismounted
and
led
his
horse
by
the
bridle
as
he
sauntered
by
her
side
she
had
always
been
very
timid
at
such
times
and
had
felt
rather
like
a
criminal
but
burmistone
had
not
been
timid
at
all
and
would
indeed
as
soon
have
met
lady
theobald
as
not
for
which
courage
his
companion
admired
him
more
than
ever
it
was
not
very
long
before
to
be
with
this
hero
her
and
made
her
feel
stronger
and
more
she
was
never
afraid
to
open
her
soft
little
heart
to
him
and
show
him
innocently
all
its
goodness
and
ignorance
of
worldliness
she
warmed
and
brightened
under
his
kindly
influence
and
was
often
surprised
in
secret
at
her
own
simple
readiness
of
wit
and
speech
it
is
odd
that
i
am
such
a
different
girl
when
when
i
am
with
you
she
said
to
him
one
day
i
even
make
little
jokes
i
never
should
think
of
making
even
the
tiniest
joke
before
grandmamma
somehow
she
never
seems
quite
to
understand
jokes
she
never
laughs
at
them
you
always
laugh
and
i
am
sure
it
is
very
kind
of
you
to
encourage
me
so
but
you
must
not
encourage
me
too
much
or
i
might
forget
and
make
a
little
joke
at
dinner
and
i
think
if
i
did
she
would
choke
over
her
soup
perhaps
when
she
dressed
her
hair
and
adorned
herself
with
pale
pink
bows
and
like
appurtenances
this
artful
young
person
had
privately
in
mind
other
beholders
than
burnham
and
other
commendation
than
that
to
be
bestowed
by
that
most
excellent
matron
do
you
mind
my
telling
you
that
you
have
put
on
an
enchanted
garment
said
burmistone
the
first
time
they
met
when
she
wore
one
of
the
gowns
i
thought
i
knew
before
how
i
do
mind
it
at
all
said
lucia
blushing
brilliantly
i
rather
like
it
it
rewards
me
for
my
industry
my
hair
is
dressed
in
a
new
way
i
hope
you
like
that
too
grandmamma
does
not
it
had
been
lady
theobald
habit
to
treat
lucia
severely
from
a
sense
of
duty
her
manner
toward
her
had
always
rather
the
tone
of
implying
that
she
was
naturally
at
fault
and
yet
her
ladyship
could
not
have
told
wherein
she
wished
the
girl
changed
in
the
good
old
school
in
which
my
lady
had
been
trained
it
was
customary
to
regard
young
people
as
weak
foolish
and
if
left
to
their
own
desires
frequently
sinful
lucia
had
not
been
left
to
her
own
desires
she
had
been
taught
to
view
herself
as
rather
a
bad
case
and
to
feel
that
she
was
far
from
being
what
her
relatives
had
a
right
to
expect
to
be
thrown
with
a
person
who
did
not
find
her
silly
or
dull
or
commonplace
was
a
new
experience
if
i
had
been
clever
lucia
said
once
to
burmistone
if
i
had
been
clever
perhaps
grandmamma
would
have
been
more
satisfied
with
me
i
have
often
wished
i
had
been
clever
if
you
had
been
a
boy
replied
burmistone
rather
grimly
and
had
squandered
her
money
and
run
into
debt
and
bullied
her
you
would
have
been
her
idol
and
she
would
have
pinched
and
starved
herself
to
supply
your
highness
extravagance
when
the
rumor
began
to
take
definite
form
and
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
burmistone
intentions
a
discussion
arose
at
once
and
went
on
in
every
genteel
parlor
would
lady
theobald
allow
lucia
to
go
and
if
she
did
not
allow
her
would
not
such
a
course
appear
very
pointed
indeed
it
was
universally
decided
that
it
would
appear
pointed
but
that
lady
theobald
would
not
mind
that
in
the
least
and
perhaps
would
rather
enjoy
it
than
otherwise
and
it
was
thought
lucia
would
not
go
and
it
is
very
likely
that
lucia
would
have
remained
at
home
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
influence
of
francis
barold
making
a
call
at
oldclough
he
found
his
august
relative
in
a
very
majestic
mood
and
she
applied
to
him
again
for
information
perhaps
she
said
you
may
be
able
to
tell
me
whether
it
is
true
that
belinda
bassett
with
emphasis
has
been
invited
by
burmistone
to
assist
him
to
receive
his
guests
yes
it
is
true
was
the
reply
i
think
i
advised
it
myself
burmistone
is
fond
of
her
they
are
great
friends
man
needs
a
woman
at
such
times
and
he
chose
belinda
bassett
in
the
first
place
he
is
on
friendly
terms
with
her
as
i
said
before
replied
barold
in
the
second
she
just
what
he
wants
not
likely
to
make
rows
there
was
a
slight
pause
before
he
finished
adding
quietly
he
not
the
man
to
submit
to
being
refused
burmistone
lady
theobald
did
not
reply
or
raise
her
eyes
from
her
work
she
knew
he
was
looking
at
her
with
calm
fixedness
through
the
glass
he
held
in
its
place
so
cleverly
and
she
detested
this
more
than
any
thing
else
perhaps
because
she
was
invariably
quelled
by
it
and
found
she
had
nothing
to
say
he
did
not
address
her
again
immediately
but
turned
to
lucia
dropping
the
eyeglass
and
resuming
his
normal
condition
you
will
go
of
course
he
said
lucia
glanced
across
at
my
lady
i
do
not
know
grandmamma
oh
interposed
barold
you
must
go
there
is
no
reason
for
your
refusing
the
invitation
unless
you
wish
to
imply
something
unpleasant
which
is
of
course
out
of
the
question
but
there
may
be
reasons
began
her
ladyship
burmistone
is
my
friend
put
in
barold
in
his
coolest
tone
and
i
am
your
relative
which
would
make
my
position
in
his
house
a
delicate
one
if
he
has
offended
you
when
lucia
saw
octavia
again
she
was
able
to
tell
her
that
they
had
received
invitations
to
the
and
that
lady
theobald
had
accepted
them
she
has
not
spoken
a
word
to
me
about
it
but
she
has
accepted
them
said
lucia
i
do
quite
understand
her
lately
octavia
she
must
be
very
fond
of
francis
barold
he
never
gives
way
to
her
in
the
least
and
she
always
seems
to
submit
to
him
i
know
she
would
not
have
let
me
go
if
he
had
not
insisted
on
it
in
that
way
of
his
naturally
burmistone
caused
great
excitement
miss
chickie
was
never
so
busy
in
her
life
and
there
were
rumors
that
her
feelings
had
been
outraged
by
the
discovery
that
burnham
had
sent
to
harriford
for
costumes
for
her
daughters
slowbridge
is
changing
mem
said
miss
chickie
with
brilliant
sarcasm
our
ladies
is
led
in
their
fashions
by
a
nevada
young
person
improving
most
rapid
more
rapid
than
i
ever
have
dared
to
hope
do
you
prefer
a
frill
or
a
flounce
mem
octavia
was
in
great
good
spirits
at
the
prospect
of
the
gayeties
in
question
she
had
been
in
remarkably
good
spirits
for
some
weeks
she
had
received
letters
from
nevada
containing
good
news
she
said
shares
had
gone
up
again
and
her
father
had
almost
settled
his
affairs
and
it
would
not
be
long
before
he
would
come
to
england
she
looked
so
exhilarated
over
the
matter
that
lucia
felt
a
little
aggrieved
will
you
be
so
glad
to
leave
us
octavia
she
asked
we
shall
not
be
so
glad
to
let
you
go
we
have
grown
very
fond
of
you
i
shall
be
sorry
to
leave
you
and
aunt
belinda
is
going
with
us
you
do
expect
me
to
be
very
fond
of
slowbridge
do
you
and
to
be
sorry
i
ca
take
burnham
and
the
rest
barold
was
present
when
she
made
this
speech
and
it
rather
rankled
am
i
one
of
rest
he
inquired
the
first
time
he
found
himself
alone
with
her
he
was
sufficiently
piqued
to
forget
his
usual
and
discretion
would
you
like
to
be
she
said
oh
very
much
very
much
naturally
he
replied
severely
they
were
standing
near
a
in
the
garden
and
she
plucked
a
rose
and
regarded
it
with
deep
interest
well
she
said
next
i
must
say
i
think
i
should
have
had
such
a
good
time
if
you
had
been
here
you
have
made
it
livelier
he
remarked
you
are
most
kind
oh
she
answered
it
true
if
it
was
i
should
say
it
you
and
burmistone
and
poppleton
have
certainly
made
it
livelier
he
went
home
in
such
a
bad
humor
that
his
host
who
was
rather
happier
than
usual
commented
upon
his
grave
aspect
at
dinner
you
look
as
if
you
had
heard
ill
news
old
fellow
he
said
up
oh
nothing
he
was
answered
sardonically
nothing
whatever
unless
that
i
have
been
rather
snubbed
by
a
young
lady
from
nevada
ah
with
great
seriousness
that
rather
cool
is
it
it
her
little
way
said
barold
it
seems
to
be
one
of
the
customs
of
nevada
in
fact
he
was
very
savage
indeed
he
felt
that
he
had
condescended
a
good
deal
lately
he
seldom
bestowed
his
time
on
women
and
when
he
did
so
at
rare
intervals
he
chose
those
who
would
do
the
most
honor
to
his
taste
at
the
least
cost
of
trouble
and
he
was
obliged
to
confess
to
himself
that
he
had
broken
his
rule
in
this
case
upon
analyzing
his
motives
and
necessities
he
found
that
after
all
he
must
have
extended
his
visit
simply
because
he
chose
to
see
more
of
this
young
woman
from
nevada
and
that
really
upon
the
whole
he
had
borne
a
good
deal
from
her
sometimes
he
had
been
much
pleased
with
her
and
very
well
entertained
but
often
enough
in
fact
rather
too
often
she
had
made
him
exceedingly
uncomfortable
her
manners
were
not
what
he
was
accustomed
to
she
did
not
consider
that
all
men
were
not
to
be
regarded
from
the
same
point
of
view
perhaps
he
did
not
put
into
definite
words
the
noble
and
patriotic
sentiment
that
an
englishman
was
not
to
be
regarded
from
the
same
point
of
view
as
an
american
and
that
though
all
this
sort
of
thing
might
do
with
fellows
in
new
york
it
was
scarcely
what
an
englishman
would
stand
perhaps
as
i
say
he
had
not
put
this
sentiment
into
words
but
it
is
quite
certain
that
it
had
been
uppermost
in
his
mind
upon
more
occasions
than
one
as
he
thought
their
acquaintance
over
this
evening
he
was
rather
severe
upon
octavia
he
even
was
roused
so
far
as
to
condescend
to
talk
her
over
with
burmistone
if
she
had
been
well
brought
up
he
said
she
would
have
been
a
different
creature
very
different
i
have
no
doubt
said
burmistone
thoughtfully
when
you
say
well
brought
up
by
the
way
do
you
mean
brought
up
like
your
cousin
miss
gaston
there
is
a
medium
said
barold
loftily
i
regret
to
say
lady
theobald
has
not
hit
upon
it
well
as
you
say
commented
burmistone
i
suppose
there
is
a
medium
a
charming
wife
she
would
make
for
a
man
with
a
position
to
maintain
remarked
barold
with
a
short
and
somewhat
savage
laugh
octavia
bassett
queried
burmistone
that
true
but
i
am
afraid
she
would
enjoy
it
if
you
are
supposing
the
man
to
be
an
englishman
brought
up
in
the
regulation
groove
ah
exclaimed
barold
impatiently
i
was
not
looking
at
it
from
her
point
of
view
but
from
his
burmistone
slipped
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
jingled
his
keys
slightly
as
he
did
once
before
in
an
earlier
part
of
this
narrative
ah
from
his
he
repeated
not
from
hers
his
point
of
view
would
differ
from
hers
naturally
barold
flashed
a
little
and
took
his
cigar
from
his
mouth
to
knock
off
the
ashes
a
man
is
not
necessarily
a
snob
he
said
because
he
is
cool
enough
not
to
lose
his
head
where
a
woman
is
concerned
you
ca
marry
a
woman
who
will
make
mistakes
and
attract
universal
attention
by
her
conduct
has
it
struck
you
that
octavia
bassett
would
inquired
burmistone
she
would
do
as
she
chose
said
barold
petulantly
she
would
do
things
which
were
unusual
but
i
was
not
referring
to
her
in
particular
why
should
i
ah
said
burmistone
i
only
thought
of
her
because
it
did
not
strike
me
that
one
would
ever
feel
she
had
exactly
blundered
she
is
not
easily
embarrassed
there
is
a
about
her
which
carries
things
off
ah
deigned
barold
she
has
enough
and
to
spare
he
was
silent
for
some
time
afterward
and
sat
smoking
later
than
usual
when
he
was
about
to
leave
the
room
for
the
night
he
made
an
announcement
for
which
his
host
was
not
altogether
prepared
when
the
is
over
my
dear
fellow
he
said
i
must
go
back
to
london
and
i
shall
be
deucedly
sorry
to
do
it
look
here
said
burmistone
that
a
new
idea
is
it
no
an
old
one
but
i
have
been
putting
the
thing
off
from
day
to
day
by
jove
i
did
not
think
it
likely
that
i
should
put
it
off
the
day
i
landed
here
and
he
laughed
rather
uneasily
chapter
xxiii
may
i
go
the
very
day
after
this
octavia
opened
the
fourth
trunk
she
had
had
it
brought
down
from
the
garret
when
there
came
a
summons
on
the
door
and
lucia
gaston
appeared
lucia
was
very
pale
and
her
large
soft
eyes
wore
a
decidedly
frightened
look
she
seemed
to
have
walked
fast
and
was
out
of
breath
evidently
something
had
happened
octavia
she
said
dugald
binnie
is
at
oldclough
who
is
he
he
is
my
explained
lucia
tremulously
he
has
a
great
deal
of
money
grandmamma
she
stopped
short
and
colored
and
drew
her
slight
figure
up
i
do
not
quite
understand
grandmamma
octavia
she
said
last
night
she
came
to
my
room
to
talk
to
me
and
this
morning
she
came
again
and
oh
she
broke
out
indignantly
how
could
she
speak
to
me
in
such
a
manner
what
did
she
say
inquired
octavia
she
said
a
great
many
things
with
great
spirit
it
took
her
a
long
time
to
say
them
and
i
do
not
wonder
at
it
it
would
have
taken
me
a
hundred
years
if
i
had
been
in
her
place
i
i
was
wrong
to
say
i
did
not
understand
her
i
did
before
she
had
finished
what
did
you
understand
she
was
afraid
to
tell
me
in
plain
i
never
saw
her
afraid
before
but
she
was
afraid
she
has
been
arranging
my
future
for
me
and
it
does
not
occur
to
her
that
i
dare
object
that
is
because
she
knows
i
am
a
coward
and
despises
me
for
it
and
it
is
what
i
deserve
if
i
make
the
marriage
she
chooses
she
thinks
binnie
will
leave
me
his
money
i
am
to
run
after
a
man
who
does
not
care
for
me
and
make
myself
attractive
in
the
hope
that
he
will
condescend
to
marry
me
because
binnie
may
leave
me
his
money
do
you
wonder
that
it
took
even
lady
theobald
a
long
time
to
say
that
well
remarked
octavia
you
wo
do
it
i
suppose
i
would
worry
she
wants
you
to
marry
barold
i
suppose
lucia
started
how
did
you
guess
she
exclaimed
oh
i
always
knew
it
i
did
guess
and
she
smiled
ever
so
faintly
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
she
loathes
me
so
she
added
lucia
thought
deeply
for
a
moment
she
recognized
all
at
once
several
things
she
had
been
mystified
by
before
oh
it
is
it
is
she
said
and
she
has
thought
of
it
all
the
time
when
i
never
suspected
her
octavia
smiled
a
little
again
lucia
sat
thinking
her
hands
clasped
tightly
i
am
glad
i
came
here
she
said
at
length
i
angry
now
and
i
see
things
more
clearly
if
she
had
only
thought
of
it
because
binnie
came
i
could
have
forgiven
her
more
easily
but
she
has
been
making
coarse
plans
all
the
time
and
treating
me
with
contempt
octavia
she
added
turning
upon
her
with
flushing
cheeks
and
sparkling
eyes
i
think
that
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
am
in
a
passion
a
real
passion
i
think
i
shall
never
be
afraid
of
her
any
more
her
delicate
nostrils
were
dilated
she
held
her
head
up
her
breath
came
fast
there
was
a
hint
of
exultation
in
her
tone
yes
she
said
i
am
in
a
passion
and
i
am
not
afraid
of
her
at
all
i
will
go
home
and
tell
her
what
i
think
and
it
is
quite
probable
that
she
would
have
done
so
but
for
a
trifling
incident
which
occurred
before
she
reached
her
ladyship
she
walked
very
fast
after
she
left
the
house
she
wanted
to
reach
oldclough
before
one
whit
of
her
anger
cooled
down
though
somehow
she
felt
quite
sure
that
even
when
her
anger
died
out
her
courage
would
not
take
flight
with
it
dugald
binnie
had
not
proved
to
be
a
very
fascinating
person
he
was
an
acrid
dictatorial
old
man
he
contradicted
lady
theobald
flatly
every
five
minutes
and
bullied
his
but
it
was
not
against
him
that
lucia
indignation
was
aroused
she
felt
that
lady
theobald
was
quite
capable
of
suggesting
to
him
that
francis
barold
would
be
a
good
match
for
her
and
if
she
had
done
so
it
was
scarcely
his
fault
if
he
had
accepted
the
idea
she
understood
now
why
she
had
been
allowed
to
visit
octavia
and
why
divers
other
things
had
happened
she
had
been
sent
to
walk
with
francis
barold
he
had
been
almost
reproached
when
he
had
not
called
perhaps
her
ladyship
had
been
good
enough
to
suggest
to
him
that
it
was
his
duty
to
further
her
plans
she
was
as
capable
of
that
as
of
any
thing
else
which
would
assist
her
to
gain
her
point
the
girl
cheeks
grew
hotter
and
hotter
her
eyes
brighter
at
every
step
because
every
step
brought
some
new
thought
her
hands
trembled
and
her
heart
beat
i
shall
never
be
afraid
of
her
again
she
said
as
she
turned
the
corner
into
the
road
never
never
and
at
that
very
moment
a
gentleman
stepped
out
of
the
wood
at
her
right
and
stopped
before
her
she
started
back
with
a
cry
mr
burmistone
she
said
mr
burmistone
she
wondered
if
he
had
heard
her
last
words
she
fancied
he
had
he
took
hold
of
her
shaking
little
hand
and
looked
down
at
her
excited
face
i
am
glad
i
waited
for
you
he
said
in
the
quietest
possible
tone
something
is
the
matter
she
knew
there
would
be
no
use
in
trying
to
conceal
the
truth
and
she
was
not
in
the
mood
to
make
the
effort
she
scarcely
knew
herself
she
gave
quite
a
fierce
little
laugh
i
am
angry
she
said
you
have
never
seen
me
angry
before
i
am
on
my
way
to
my
to
lady
theobald
he
held
her
hand
as
calmly
as
before
he
understood
a
great
deal
more
than
she
could
have
imagined
what
are
you
going
to
say
to
her
he
asked
she
laughed
again
i
am
going
to
ask
her
what
she
means
i
am
going
to
tell
her
she
has
made
a
mistake
i
am
going
to
prove
to
her
that
i
am
not
such
a
coward
after
all
i
am
going
to
tell
her
that
i
dare
disobey
her
is
what
i
am
going
to
say
to
her
she
concluded
decisively
he
held
her
hand
rather
closer
let
us
take
a
stroll
in
the
copse
and
talk
it
over
he
said
it
is
deliciously
cool
there
i
do
want
to
be
cool
she
said
but
he
drew
her
gently
with
him
and
a
few
steps
took
them
into
the
shade
of
the
young
oaks
and
pines
and
there
he
paused
she
has
made
you
very
angry
he
said
and
then
almost
before
she
knew
what
she
was
doing
she
was
pouring
forth
the
whole
of
her
story
even
more
of
it
than
she
had
told
octavia
she
had
not
at
all
intended
to
do
it
but
she
did
it
nevertheless
i
am
to
marry
francis
barold
if
he
will
take
me
she
said
with
a
bitter
little
smile
francis
barold
who
is
so
much
in
love
with
me
as
you
know
his
mother
approves
of
the
match
and
sent
him
here
to
make
love
to
me
which
he
has
done
as
you
have
seen
i
have
no
money
of
my
own
but
if
i
make
a
marriage
which
pleases
him
dugald
binnie
will
probably
leave
me
his
which
it
is
thought
will
be
an
inducement
to
my
cousin
who
needs
one
if
i
marry
him
or
rather
he
marries
me
lady
theobald
thinks
binnie
will
be
pleased
it
does
not
even
matter
whether
francis
is
pleased
or
not
and
of
course
i
am
out
of
the
question
but
it
is
hoped
that
it
will
please
binnie
the
two
ladies
have
talked
it
over
and
decided
the
matter
i
dare
say
they
have
offered
me
to
francis
who
has
very
likely
refused
me
though
perhaps
he
may
be
persuaded
to
relent
in
time
if
i
am
very
humble
and
he
is
shown
the
advantage
of
having
binnie
money
added
to
his
own
but
i
have
no
doubt
i
shall
have
to
be
very
humble
indeed
that
is
what
i
learned
from
lady
theobald
last
night
and
it
is
what
i
am
going
to
talk
to
her
about
is
it
enough
to
make
one
angry
do
you
think
is
it
enough
he
did
not
tell
her
whether
he
thought
it
enough
or
not
he
looked
at
her
with
steady
eyes
lucia
he
said
i
wish
you
would
let
me
go
and
talk
with
lady
theobald
you
she
said
with
a
little
start
yes
he
answered
let
me
go
to
her
let
me
tell
her
that
instead
of
marrying
francis
barold
you
will
marry
if
you
will
say
yes
to
that
i
think
i
can
promise
that
you
need
never
be
afraid
of
her
any
more
the
fierce
color
died
out
of
her
cheeks
and
the
tears
rushed
to
her
eyes
she
raised
her
face
with
a
pathetic
look
oh
she
whispered
you
must
be
very
sorry
for
me
i
think
you
have
been
sorry
for
me
from
the
first
i
am
desperately
in
love
with
you
he
answered
in
his
quietest
way
i
have
been
desperately
in
love
with
you
from
the
first
may
i
go
she
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
incredulously
then
she
faltered
yes
she
still
looked
up
at
him
and
then
in
spite
of
her
happiness
or
perhaps
because
of
it
she
suddenly
began
to
cry
softly
and
forgot
she
had
been
angry
at
all
as
he
took
her
into
his
strong
kind
arms
chapter
xxiv
the
the
morning
of
the
arose
bright
and
clear
and
slowbridge
awakened
in
a
great
state
of
excitement
miss
chickie
having
worked
until
midnight
that
all
her
orders
might
be
completed
was
so
overpowered
by
her
labors
as
to
have
to
take
her
tea
and
toast
in
bed
at
oldclough
varied
sentiments
prevailed
lady
theobald
manner
was
chiefly
distinguished
by
an
implacable
rigidity
she
had
chosen
as
an
appropriate
festal
costume
a
enlivened
by
massive
fringes
and
ornaments
of
jet
her
jewelry
being
chains
and
manacles
of
the
latter
which
rattled
as
she
moved
with
a
sound
somewhat
suggestive
of
bones
dugald
binnie
who
had
received
an
invitation
had
as
yet
amiably
forborne
to
say
whether
he
would
accept
it
or
not
he
had
been
out
when
burmistone
called
and
had
not
seen
him
when
lady
theobald
descended
to
breakfast
she
found
him
growling
over
his
newspaper
and
he
glanced
up
at
her
with
a
polite
scowl
going
to
a
funeral
he
demanded
i
accompany
my
granddaughter
to
this
this
entertainment
her
ladyship
responded
it
is
scarcely
a
joyous
occasion
to
my
mind
no
need
to
dress
yourself
like
that
if
it
is
ejaculated
binnie
why
do
you
stay
at
home
if
you
do
want
to
go
man
all
right
is
he
once
knew
a
man
by
the
name
of
burmistone
myself
one
of
the
few
decent
fellows
i
met
if
i
were
sure
this
was
the
same
man
i
go
myself
when
i
find
a
fellow
who
neither
knave
nor
fool
i
stick
to
him
believe
i
send
to
find
out
where
lucia
what
his
opinion
of
lucia
was
it
was
difficult
to
discover
he
had
an
agreeable
habit
of
staring
at
her
over
the
top
of
his
paper
and
over
his
dinner
the
only
time
he
had
made
any
comment
upon
her
was
the
first
time
he
saw
her
in
the
dress
she
had
copied
from
octavia
nice
gown
that
he
blurted
out
did
get
it
here
i
wager
it
an
old
dress
i
remodelled
answered
lucia
somewhat
alarmed
i
made
it
myself
does
look
like
it
he
said
gruffly
lucia
had
touched
up
another
dress
and
was
very
happy
in
the
prospect
of
wearing
it
at
the
do
call
on
grandmamma
until
after
wednesday
she
had
said
to
burmistone
perhaps
she
would
let
me
go
she
will
be
very
angry
i
am
sure
and
you
are
not
afraid
no
she
answered
i
am
not
afraid
at
all
i
shall
not
be
afraid
again
in
fact
she
had
perfectly
confounded
her
ladyship
by
her
demeanor
she
bore
her
fiercest
glance
without
quailing
in
the
least
or
making
any
effort
to
evade
it
under
her
most
scathing
comments
she
was
composed
and
unmoved
on
the
first
occasion
of
my
lady
referring
to
her
plans
for
her
future
she
received
a
blow
which
fairly
stunned
her
the
girl
rose
from
her
chair
and
looked
her
straight
in
the
face
unflinchingly
and
with
a
suggestion
of
not
easy
to
confront
i
beg
you
will
not
speak
to
me
of
that
again
she
said
i
will
not
listen
and
turning
about
she
walked
out
of
the
room
this
her
ladyship
had
said
in
sepulchral
tones
when
she
recovered
her
breath
this
is
one
of
the
results
of
miss
octavia
bassett
and
nothing
more
had
been
said
on
the
subject
since
no
one
in
slowbridge
was
in
more
brilliant
spirits
than
octavia
herself
on
the
morning
of
the
before
breakfast
miss
belinda
was
startled
by
the
arrival
of
another
telegram
which
ran
as
follows
arrived
per
be
with
you
tomorrow
evening
friend
with
me
martin
bassett
on
reading
this
communication
miss
belinda
burst
into
floods
of
delighted
tears
dear
dear
martin
she
wept
to
think
that
we
should
meet
again
did
he
let
us
know
he
was
on
the
way
i
should
have
been
so
anxious
that
i
should
not
have
slept
at
all
well
remarked
octavia
i
suppose
that
would
have
been
an
advantage
suddenly
she
approached
miss
belinda
kissed
her
and
disappeared
out
of
the
room
as
if
by
magic
not
returning
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
looking
rather
soft
and
moist
and
brilliant
about
the
eyes
when
she
did
return
octavia
was
a
marked
figure
upon
the
grounds
at
that
another
dress
my
dear
remarked
burnham
and
what
a
charming
color
she
has
i
declare
she
is
usually
paler
perhaps
we
owe
this
to
lord
lansdowne
her
dress
is
becoming
at
all
events
privately
remarked
miss
lydia
burnham
whose
tastes
had
not
been
consulted
about
her
own
it
is
she
who
is
becoming
said
her
sister
it
is
not
the
dress
so
much
though
her
clothes
always
have
a
some
way
she
prettier
than
ever
and
is
enjoying
herself
she
was
enjoying
herself
francis
barold
observed
it
rather
gloomily
as
he
stood
apart
she
was
enjoying
herself
so
much
that
she
did
not
seem
to
notice
that
he
had
avoided
her
instead
of
going
up
to
claim
her
attention
half
a
dozen
men
were
standing
about
her
and
making
themselves
agreeable
and
she
was
apparently
quite
equal
to
the
emergencies
of
the
occasion
the
young
men
from
broadoaks
had
at
once
attached
themselves
to
her
train
i
say
barold
they
had
said
to
him
why
did
you
tell
us
about
this
jolly
good
fellow
you
are
to
come
mooning
here
for
a
couple
of
months
and
keep
it
all
to
yourself
and
then
had
come
lord
lansdowne
who
in
crossing
the
lawn
to
shake
hands
with
his
host
had
been
observed
to
keep
his
eye
fixed
upon
one
particular
point
burmistone
he
said
after
having
spoken
his
first
words
who
is
that
tall
girl
in
white
and
in
ten
minutes
lady
theobald
burnham
barold
and
divers
others
too
numerous
to
mention
saw
him
standing
at
octavia
side
evidently
with
no
intention
of
leaving
it
not
long
after
this
francis
barold
found
his
way
to
miss
belinda
who
was
very
busy
and
rather
nervous
your
niece
is
evidently
enjoying
herself
he
remarked
octavia
is
most
happy
answered
miss
belinda
her
father
will
reach
slowbridge
this
evening
she
has
been
looking
forward
to
his
coming
with
great
anxiety
ah
commented
barold
very
few
people
understand
octavia
said
miss
belinda
i
not
sure
that
i
follow
all
her
moods
myself
she
is
more
affectionate
than
people
fancy
she
she
has
very
pretty
ways
i
am
very
fond
of
her
she
is
not
as
frivolous
as
she
appears
to
those
who
do
know
her
well
barold
stood
gnawing
his
mustache
and
made
no
reply
he
was
not
very
comfortable
he
felt
himself
by
fate
and
rather
wished
he
had
returned
to
london
from
broadoaks
instead
of
loitering
in
slowbridge
he
had
amused
himself
at
first
but
in
time
he
had
been
surprised
to
find
his
amusement
lose
something
of
its
zest
he
glowered
across
the
lawn
at
the
group
under
a
certain
and
as
he
did
so
octavia
turned
her
face
a
little
and
saw
him
she
stood
waving
her
fan
slowly
and
smiling
at
him
in
a
calm
way
which
reminded
him
very
much
of
the
time
he
had
first
caught
sight
of
her
at
lady
theobald
high
tea
he
condescended
to
saunter
over
the
grass
to
where
she
stood
once
there
he
proceeded
to
make
himself
as
disagreeable
as
possible
in
a
silent
and
lofty
way
he
felt
it
only
due
to
himself
that
he
should
he
did
not
approve
at
all
of
the
manner
in
which
lansdowne
kept
by
her
it
deucedly
bad
form
on
his
part
he
said
mentally
what
does
he
mean
by
it
octavia
on
the
contrary
did
not
ask
what
he
meant
by
it
she
chose
to
seem
rather
well
entertained
and
did
not
notice
that
she
was
being
frowned
down
there
was
no
reason
why
she
should
not
find
lord
lansdowne
entertaining
he
was
an
agreeable
young
fellow
with
an
inexhaustible
fund
of
good
spirits
and
no
nonsense
about
him
he
was
fond
of
all
pleasant
novelty
and
octavia
was
a
pleasant
novelty
he
had
been
thinking
of
paying
a
visit
to
america
and
he
asked
innumerable
questions
concerning
that
country
all
of
which
octavia
answered
i
know
half
a
dozen
fellows
who
have
been
there
he
said
and
they
all
enjoyed
it
tremendously
if
you
go
to
nevada
you
must
visit
the
mines
at
bloody
gulch
she
said
where
he
ejaculated
i
say
what
a
name
do
deride
my
youth
and
ignorance
miss
bassett
you
can
call
it
if
you
would
rather
she
replied
i
would
rather
try
the
other
thank
you
he
laughed
it
has
a
more
hilarious
sound
will
they
despise
me
at
bloody
gulch
miss
bassett
i
never
killed
a
man
in
my
life
barold
turned
and
walked
away
angry
and
more
melancholy
than
he
could
have
believed
it
is
time
i
went
back
to
london
he
chose
to
put
it
the
place
begins
to
be
deucedly
dull
francis
barold
seems
rather
out
of
spirits
said
burnham
to
lady
theobald
lord
lansdowne
interferes
with
his
pleasure
i
had
not
observed
it
answered
her
ladyship
and
it
is
scarcely
likely
that
francis
barold
would
permit
his
pleasure
to
be
interfered
with
even
by
the
son
of
the
marquis
of
lauderdale
but
she
glared
at
barold
as
he
passed
and
beckoned
to
him
where
is
lucia
she
i
saw
her
with
burmistone
half
an
hour
ago
he
answered
coldly
have
you
any
message
for
my
mother
i
shall
return
to
london
leaving
here
early
she
turned
quite
pale
she
had
not
counted
upon
this
at
all
and
it
was
extremely
inopportune
what
has
happened
she
asked
rigidly
he
looked
slightly
surprised
nothing
whatever
he
replied
i
have
remained
here
longer
than
i
intended
she
began
to
move
the
manacles
on
her
right
wrist
he
made
not
the
smallest
profession
of
reluctance
to
go
she
said
at
last
if
you
will
find
lucia
you
will
oblige
me
she
was
almost
uncivil
to
miss
pilcher
who
chanced
to
join
her
after
he
was
gone
she
had
not
the
slightest
intention
of
allowing
her
plans
to
be
frustrated
and
was
only
roused
to
fresh
obstinacy
by
encountering
indifference
on
one
side
and
rebellion
on
the
other
she
had
not
brought
lucia
up
under
her
own
eye
for
nothing
she
had
been
disturbed
of
late
but
by
no
means
considered
herself
baffled
with
the
assistance
of
dugald
binnie
she
could
certainly
subdue
lucia
though
dugald
binnie
had
been
of
no
great
help
so
far
she
would
do
her
duty
unflinchingly
in
fact
she
chose
to
persuade
herself
that
if
lucia
was
brought
to
a
proper
frame
of
mind
there
could
be
no
real
trouble
with
francis
barold
chapter
xxv
somebody
else
but
barold
did
not
make
any
very
ardent
search
for
lucia
he
stopped
to
watch
a
game
of
in
which
octavia
and
lord
lansdowne
had
joined
and
finally
forgot
lady
theobald
errand
altogether
for
some
time
octavia
did
not
see
him
she
was
playing
with
great
spirit
and
lord
lansdowne
was
following
her
delightedly
finally
a
chance
of
the
game
bringing
her
to
him
she
turned
suddenly
and
found
barold
eyes
fixed
upon
her
how
long
have
you
been
there
she
asked
some
time
he
answered
when
you
are
at
liberty
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
do
you
she
said
she
seemed
a
little
unprepared
for
the
repressed
energy
of
his
manner
which
he
strove
to
cover
by
a
greater
amount
of
coldness
than
usual
well
she
said
after
thinking
a
moment
the
game
will
soon
be
ended
i
am
going
through
the
conservatories
with
lord
lansdowne
in
course
of
time
but
i
dare
say
he
can
wait
she
went
back
and
finished
her
game
apparently
enjoying
it
as
much
as
ever
when
it
was
over
barold
made
his
way
to
her
he
had
resented
her
remaining
oblivious
of
his
presence
when
he
stood
near
her
and
he
had
resented
her
enjoyment
of
her
surroundings
and
now
as
he
led
her
away
leaving
lord
lansdowne
rather
disconsolate
he
resented
the
fact
that
she
did
not
seem
nervous
or
at
all
impressed
by
his
silence
what
do
you
want
to
say
to
me
she
asked
let
us
go
and
sit
down
in
one
of
the
arbors
i
believe
i
am
a
little
tired
not
that
i
mind
it
though
i
been
having
a
lovely
time
then
she
began
to
talk
about
lord
lansdowne
i
like
him
ever
so
much
she
said
do
you
think
he
will
really
go
to
america
i
wish
he
would
but
if
he
does
i
hope
it
wo
be
for
a
year
or
so
i
mean
until
we
go
back
from
europe
still
it
rather
uncertain
when
we
go
back
did
i
tell
you
i
had
persuaded
aunt
belinda
to
travel
with
us
she
horribly
frightened
but
i
mean
to
make
her
go
she
get
over
being
frightened
after
a
little
while
suddenly
she
turned
and
looked
at
him
why
do
you
say
something
she
demanded
what
the
matter
it
is
not
necessary
for
me
to
say
any
thing
she
laughed
do
you
mean
because
i
am
saying
every
thing
myself
well
i
suppose
i
am
i
am
awfully
happy
and
ca
help
talking
it
seems
to
make
the
time
go
her
face
had
lighted
up
curiously
there
was
a
delighted
excitement
in
her
eyes
puzzling
him
are
you
so
fond
of
your
father
as
all
that
she
laughed
again
a
clear
exultant
laugh
yes
she
answered
of
course
i
am
as
fond
of
him
as
all
that
quite
natural
is
it
i
have
observed
the
same
degree
of
enthusiasm
in
all
the
young
ladies
of
my
acquaintance
he
returned
dryly
he
thought
such
rapture
disproportionate
to
the
cause
and
regarded
it
grudgingly
they
turned
into
an
arbor
and
octavia
sat
down
and
leaned
forward
on
the
rustic
table
then
she
turned
her
face
up
to
look
at
the
vines
covering
the
roof
it
looks
rather
spidery
does
it
she
remarked
i
hope
it
is
do
you
the
light
fell
bewitchingly
on
her
round
little
chin
and
white
throat
and
a
bar
of
sunlight
struck
on
her
upturned
eyes
and
the
blonde
rings
on
her
forehead
there
is
nothing
i
hate
more
than
spiders
she
said
with
a
little
shiver
unless
seriously
it
caterpillars
and
caterpillars
i
loathe
then
she
lowered
her
gaze
and
gave
her
hat
a
large
white
rubens
all
soft
curling
feathers
and
satin
bows
a
charming
tip
over
her
eyes
the
brim
is
broad
she
said
if
any
thing
drops
i
hope
it
will
drop
on
it
instead
of
on
me
now
what
did
you
want
to
say
he
had
not
sat
down
but
stood
leaning
against
the
rustic
he
looked
pale
and
was
evidently
trying
to
be
cooler
than
usual
i
brought
you
here
to
ask
you
a
question
well
she
remarked
i
hope
it
an
important
one
you
look
serious
enough
it
is
important
rather
he
responded
with
a
tone
of
sarcasm
you
will
probably
go
away
soon
that
is
exactly
a
question
she
commented
and
it
not
as
important
to
you
as
to
me
he
paused
a
moment
annoyed
because
he
found
it
difficult
to
go
on
annoyed
because
she
waited
with
such
undisturbed
serenity
but
at
length
he
managed
to
begin
again
i
do
not
think
you
are
expecting
the
question
i
am
going
to
ask
he
said
i
do
not
think
i
expected
to
ask
it
myself
until
i
do
not
know
why
why
i
should
ask
it
so
awkwardly
and
feel
at
such
a
disadvantage
i
brought
you
here
to
ask
you
to
marry
me
he
had
scarcely
spoken
four
words
before
all
her
airy
manner
had
taken
flight
and
she
had
settled
herself
down
to
listen
he
had
noticed
this
and
had
felt
it
quite
natural
when
he
stopped
she
was
looking
straight
into
his
face
her
eyes
were
singularly
large
and
bright
and
clear
you
did
not
expect
to
ask
me
to
marry
you
she
said
why
did
you
it
was
not
at
all
what
he
had
expected
he
did
not
understand
her
manner
at
all
i
must
confess
he
said
stiffly
that
i
felt
at
first
that
there
were
obstacles
in
the
way
of
my
doing
so
what
were
the
obstacles
he
flushed
and
drew
himself
up
i
have
been
unfortunate
in
my
mode
of
expressing
myself
he
said
i
told
you
i
was
conscious
of
my
own
awkwardness
yes
she
said
quietly
you
have
been
unfortunate
that
is
a
good
way
of
putting
it
then
she
let
her
eyes
rest
on
the
table
a
few
seconds
and
thought
a
little
after
all
she
said
i
have
the
consolation
of
knowing
that
you
must
have
been
very
much
in
love
with
me
if
you
had
not
been
very
much
in
love
with
me
you
would
never
have
asked
me
to
marry
you
you
would
have
considered
the
obstacles
i
am
very
much
in
love
with
you
he
said
vehemently
his
feelings
getting
the
better
of
his
pride
for
once
however
badly
i
may
have
expressed
myself
i
am
very
much
in
love
with
you
i
have
been
wretched
for
days
was
it
because
you
felt
obliged
to
ask
me
to
marry
you
she
inquired
the
delicate
touch
of
spirit
in
her
tone
and
words
fired
him
to
fresh
admiration
strange
to
say
it
suggested
to
him
possibilities
he
had
not
suspected
hitherto
he
drew
nearer
to
her
do
be
too
severe
on
me
he
said
quite
humbly
considering
all
things
and
he
stretched
out
his
hand
as
if
to
take
hers
but
she
drew
it
back
smiling
ever
so
faintly
do
you
think
i
do
know
what
the
obstacles
are
she
said
i
will
tell
you
my
affection
was
strong
enough
to
sweep
them
away
he
said
or
i
should
not
be
here
she
smiled
slightly
again
i
know
all
about
them
as
well
as
you
do
she
said
i
rather
laughed
at
them
at
first
but
i
do
now
i
suppose
i
by
their
seriousness
as
aunt
belinda
says
i
suppose
they
pretty
serious
to
you
nothing
would
be
so
serious
to
me
as
that
you
should
let
them
interfere
with
my
happiness
he
answered
thrown
back
upon
himself
and
bewildered
by
her
logical
manner
let
us
forget
them
i
was
a
fool
to
speak
as
i
did
wo
you
answer
my
question
she
paused
a
second
and
then
answered
you
did
expect
to
ask
me
to
marry
you
she
said
and
i
expect
you
to
but
now
he
broke
in
impatiently
now
i
wish
you
had
done
it
you
wish
you
do
want
she
said
you
want
somebody
meeker
somebody
who
would
respect
you
very
much
and
obey
you
i
not
used
to
obeying
people
do
you
mean
also
that
you
would
not
respect
me
he
inquired
bitterly
oh
she
replied
you
have
respected
me
much
excuse
me
he
began
in
his
loftiest
manner
you
did
respect
me
enough
to
think
me
worth
marrying
she
said
i
was
not
the
kind
of
girl
you
would
have
chosen
of
your
own
will
you
are
treating
me
unfairly
he
cried
you
were
going
to
give
me
a
great
deal
i
suppose
looking
at
it
in
your
way
she
went
on
but
if
i
exactly
what
you
wanted
i
had
something
to
give
too
i
young
enough
to
have
a
good
many
years
to
live
and
i
should
have
to
live
them
with
you
if
i
married
you
something
you
know
he
rose
from
his
seat
pale
with
wrath
and
wounded
feeling
does
this
mean
that
you
refuse
me
he
demanded
that
your
answer
is
she
rose
too
not
exultant
not
confused
neither
pale
nor
flushed
he
had
never
seen
her
prettier
more
charming
or
more
natural
it
would
have
been
even
if
there
had
been
any
obstacle
she
answered
then
he
said
i
need
say
no
more
i
see
that
i
have
humiliated
myself
in
vain
and
it
is
rather
bitter
i
must
confess
it
was
my
fault
she
remarked
he
stepped
back
with
a
haughty
wave
of
the
hand
signifying
that
she
should
pass
out
of
the
arbor
before
him
she
did
so
but
just
as
she
reached
the
entrance
she
turned
and
stood
for
a
second
framed
in
by
the
swinging
vines
and
their
blossoms
there
another
reason
why
it
should
be
she
said
i
suppose
i
may
as
well
tell
you
of
it
i
engaged
to
somebody
else
chapter
xxvi
jack
the
first
person
they
saw
when
they
reached
the
lawn
was
dugald
binnie
who
had
deigned
to
present
himself
and
was
talking
to
burmistone
lucia
and
miss
belinda
i
go
to
them
said
octavia
aunt
belinda
will
wonder
where
i
have
been
but
before
they
reached
the
group
they
were
intercepted
by
lord
lansdowne
and
barold
had
the
pleasure
of
surrendering
his
charge
and
watching
her
with
some
rather
sharp
pangs
as
she
was
borne
off
to
the
conservatories
what
is
the
matter
with
mr
barold
exclaimed
miss
pilcher
pray
look
at
him
he
has
been
talking
to
miss
octavia
bassett
in
one
of
the
arbors
put
in
miss
lydia
burnham
emily
and
i
passed
them
a
few
minutes
ago
and
they
were
so
absorbed
that
they
did
not
see
us
there
is
no
knowing
what
has
happened
lydia
exclaimed
burnham
in
stern
reproof
of
such
flippancy
but
the
next
moment
she
exchanged
a
glance
with
miss
pilcher
do
you
think
she
suggested
is
it
possible
it
really
looks
very
like
it
said
miss
pilcher
though
it
is
scarcely
to
be
credited
see
how
pale
and
angry
he
looks
burnham
glanced
toward
him
and
then
a
slight
smile
illuminated
her
countenance
how
furious
she
remarked
cheerfully
how
furious
lady
theobald
will
be
naturally
it
was
not
very
long
before
the
attention
of
numerous
other
ladies
was
directed
to
francis
barold
it
was
observed
that
he
took
no
share
in
the
festivities
that
he
did
not
regain
his
natural
air
of
enviable
indifference
to
his
surroundings
that
he
did
not
approach
octavia
bassett
until
all
was
over
and
she
was
on
the
point
of
going
home
what
he
said
to
her
then
no
one
heard
i
am
going
to
london
she
answered
holding
out
her
hand
to
him
then
she
added
quickly
in
an
you
ought
to
think
badly
of
me
you
wo
after
a
while
as
they
drove
homeward
she
was
rather
silent
and
miss
belinda
remarked
it
i
am
afraid
you
are
tired
octavia
she
said
it
is
a
pity
that
martin
should
come
and
find
you
tired
oh
i
not
tired
i
was
only
thinking
it
has
been
a
queer
day
a
queer
day
my
dear
ejaculated
miss
belinda
i
thought
it
a
charming
day
so
it
has
been
said
octavia
which
miss
belinda
thought
rather
inconsistent
both
of
them
grew
rather
restless
as
they
neared
the
house
to
think
said
miss
belinda
of
my
seeing
poor
martin
again
suppose
said
octavia
nervously
as
they
drew
up
suppose
they
are
here
already
they
exclaimed
miss
belinda
who
but
she
got
no
farther
a
cry
burst
from
octavia
a
queer
soft
little
cry
they
are
here
she
said
they
are
jack
jack
and
she
was
out
of
the
carriage
and
miss
belinda
following
her
closely
was
horrified
to
see
her
caught
at
once
in
the
embrace
of
a
tall
bronzed
young
man
who
a
moment
after
drew
her
into
the
little
parlor
and
shut
the
door
martin
bassett
who
was
big
and
sunburned
and
stood
in
the
passage
smiling
triumphantly
m
m
martin
gasped
miss
belinda
what
oh
what
does
this
mean
martin
bassett
led
her
to
a
seat
and
smiled
more
triumphantly
still
never
mind
belinda
he
said
do
be
frightened
it
jack
belasys
and
he
the
finest
fellow
in
the
west
and
she
has
seen
him
for
two
years
martin
miss
belinda
fluttered
it
is
not
proper
it
really
is
yes
it
is
answered
bassett
for
he
going
to
marry
her
before
we
go
abroad
it
was
an
eventful
day
for
all
parties
concerned
at
its
close
lady
theobald
found
herself
in
an
utterly
bewildered
and
thunderstruck
condition
and
to
dugald
binnie
more
than
to
any
one
else
her
demoralization
was
due
that
gentleman
got
into
the
carriage
in
rather
a
better
humor
than
usual
same
man
i
used
to
know
he
remarked
glad
to
see
him
i
knew
him
as
soon
as
i
set
eyes
on
him
do
you
allude
to
mr
burmistone
yes
had
a
long
talk
with
him
he
coming
to
see
you
told
him
he
might
come
myself
appears
he
taken
a
fancy
to
lucia
wants
to
talk
it
over
suits
me
exactly
and
suppose
it
suits
her
looks
as
if
it
does
glad
she
has
taken
a
fancy
to
some
fellow
like
that
fool
barold
girls
generally
do
burmistone
worth
ten
of
him
lucia
who
had
been
looking
steadily
out
of
the
turned
with
an
amazed
expression
lady
theobald
had
received
a
shock
which
made
all
her
manacles
rattle
she
could
scarcely
support
herself
under
it
do
i
she
said
am
i
to
understand
that
francis
barold
does
not
meet
with
your
approval
binnie
struck
his
stick
sharply
upon
the
floor
of
the
carriage
yes
by
george
he
said
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
chaps
like
that
if
she
taken
up
with
him
she
never
have
heard
from
again
make
sure
of
that
when
they
reached
oldclough
her
ladyship
followed
lucia
to
her
room
she
stood
before
her
arranging
the
manacles
on
her
wrists
nervously
i
begin
to
understand
now
she
said
i
find
i
was
mistaken
in
my
impressions
of
dugald
binnie
tastes
and
in
my
impressions
of
you
are
to
marry
burmistone
my
rule
is
over
permit
me
to
congratulate
you
the
tears
rose
to
lucia
eyes
grandmamma
she
said
her
voice
soft
and
broken
i
think
i
should
have
been
more
frank
if
if
you
had
been
kinder
sometimes
i
have
done
my
duty
by
you
said
my
lady
lucia
looked
at
her
pathetically
i
have
been
ashamed
to
keep
things
from
you
she
hesitated
and
i
have
often
told
myself
that
that
it
was
sly
to
do
it
but
i
could
not
help
it
i
trust
said
my
lady
that
you
will
be
more
candid
with
mr
burmistone
lucia
blushed
guiltily
i
think
i
shall
grandmamma
she
said
it
was
the
rev
alfred
poppleton
who
assisted
the
rector
of
james
to
marry
jack
belasys
and
octavia
bassett
and
it
was
observed
that
he
was
almost
as
pale
as
his
surplice
slowbridge
had
never
seen
such
a
wedding
or
such
a
bride
as
octavia
it
was
even
admitted
that
jack
belasys
was
a
singularly
handsome
fellow
and
had
a
dashing
adventurous
air
which
carried
all
before
it
there
was
a
rumor
that
he
owned
himself
and
had
even
done
something
in
diamonds
in
brazil
where
he
had
spent
the
last
two
years
at
all
events
it
was
ascertained
beyond
doubt
that
being
at
last
a
married
woman
and
entitled
to
splendors
of
the
kind
octavia
would
not
lack
them
her
present
to
lucia
who
was
one
of
her
bridesmaids
dazzled
all
beholders
when
she
was
borne
away
by
the
train
with
her
father
and
husband
and
miss
belinda
whose
were
bedewed
with
tears
the
rev
alfred
poppleton
was
the
last
man
who
shook
hands
with
her
he
held
in
his
hand
a
large
bouquet
which
octavia
herself
had
given
him
out
of
her
abundance
slowbridge
will
miss
you
miss
belasys
he
faltered
i
i
shall
miss
you
perhaps
we
may
even
meet
again
i
have
thought
that
perhaps
i
should
like
to
go
to
america
and
as
the
train
puffed
out
of
the
station
and
disappeared
he
stood
motionless
for
several
seconds
and
a
large
and
brilliant
drop
of
moisture
appeared
on
the
calyx
of
the
lily
which
formed
the
of
his
bouquet
