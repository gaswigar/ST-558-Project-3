edition
december
to
my
beloved
uncle
tokitoshi
ota
who
taught
me
to
revere
the
past
and
to
admire
the
deeds
of
the
samurai
i
dedicate
this
little
book
that
way
over
the
mountain
which
who
stands
upon
is
apt
to
doubt
if
it
be
indeed
a
road
while
if
he
views
it
from
the
waste
itself
up
goes
the
line
there
plain
from
base
to
brow
not
vague
mistakable
what
a
break
or
two
seen
from
the
unbroken
desert
either
side
and
then
to
bring
in
fresh
philosophy
what
if
the
breaks
themselves
should
prove
at
last
the
most
consummate
of
contrivances
to
train
a
man

teach
him

is

there
are
if
i
may
so
say
three
powerful
spirits
which
have
from
time
to
time
moved
on
the
face
of
the
waters
and
given
a
predominant
impulse
to
the
moral
sentiments
and
energies
of
mankind
these
are
the
spirits
of
liberty
of
religion
and
of
honor

schlegel
of
preface
about
ten
years
ago
while
spending
a
few
days
under
the
hospitable
roof
of
the
distinguished
belgian
jurist
the
lamented
de
laveleye
our
conversation
turned
during
one
of
our
rambles
to
the
subject
of
religion
do
you
mean
to
say
asked
the
venerable
professor
that
you
have
no
religious
instruction
in
your
schools
on
my
replying
in
the
negative
he
suddenly
halted
in
astonishment
and
in
a
voice
which
i
shall
not
easily
forget
he
repeated
no
religion
how
do
you
impart
moral
education
the
question
stunned
me
at
the
time
i
could
give
no
ready
answer
for
the
moral
precepts
i
learned
in
my
childhood
days
were
not
given
in
schools
and
not
until
i
began
to
analyze
the
different
elements
that
formed
my
notions
of
right
and
wrong
did
i
find
that
it
was
bushido
that
breathed
them
into
my
nostrils
the
direct
inception
of
this
little
book
is
due
to
the
frequent
queries
put
by
my
wife
as
to
the
reasons
why
such
and
such
ideas
and
customs
prevail
in
japan
in
my
attempts
to
give
satisfactory
replies
to
de
laveleye
and
to
my
wife
i
found
that
without
understanding
feudalism
and
bushido
the
moral
ideas
of
present
japan
are
a
sealed
volume
footnote
pronounced
in
putting
japanese
words
and
names
into
english
hepburn
rule
is
followed
that
the
vowels
should
be
used
as
in
european
languages
and
the
consonants
as
in
english
taking
advantage
of
enforced
idleness
on
account
of
long
illness
i
put
down
in
the
order
now
presented
to
the
public
some
of
the
answers
given
in
our
household
conversation
they
consist
mainly
of
what
i
was
taught
and
told
in
my
youthful
days
when
feudalism
was
still
in
force
between
lafcadio
hearn
and
hugh
fraser
on
one
side
and
sir
ernest
satow
and
professor
chamberlain
on
the
other
it
is
indeed
discouraging
to
write
anything
japanese
in
english
the
only
advantage
i
have
over
them
is
that
i
can
assume
the
attitude
of
a
personal
defendant
while
these
distinguished
writers
are
at
best
solicitors
and
attorneys
i
have
often
thought
had
i
their
gift
of
language
i
would
present
the
cause
of
japan
in
more
eloquent
terms
but
one
who
speaks
in
a
borrowed
tongue
should
be
thankful
if
he
can
just
make
himself
intelligible
all
through
the
discourse
i
have
tried
to
illustrate
whatever
points
i
have
made
with
parallel
examples
from
european
history
and
literature
believing
that
these
will
aid
in
bringing
the
subject
nearer
to
the
comprehension
of
foreign
readers
should
any
of
my
allusions
to
religious
subjects
and
to
religious
workers
be
thought
slighting
i
trust
my
attitude
towards
christianity
itself
will
not
be
questioned
it
is
with
ecclesiastical
methods
and
with
the
forms
which
obscure
the
teachings
of
christ
and
not
with
the
teachings
themselves
that
i
have
little
sympathy
i
believe
in
the
religion
taught
by
him
and
handed
down
to
us
in
the
new
testament
as
well
as
in
the
law
written
in
the
heart
further
i
believe
that
god
hath
made
a
testament
which
maybe
called
old
with
every
people
and
nation
gentile
or
jew
christian
or
heathen
as
to
the
rest
of
my
theology
i
need
not
impose
upon
the
patience
of
the
public
in
concluding
this
preface
i
wish
to
express
my
thanks
to
my
friend
anna
hartshorne
for
many
valuable
suggestions
and
for
the
characteristically

design
made
by
her

preface
to
the
tenth
and
revised
edition
since
its
first
publication
in
philadelphia
more
than
six
years
ago
this
little
book
has
had
an
unexpected
history
the
japanese
reprint
has
passed
through
eight
editions
the
present
thus
being
its
tenth
appearance
in
the
english
language
simultaneously
with
this
will
be
issued
an
american
and
english
edition
through
the
of
george
putnam
sons
of

in
the
meantime
has
been
translated
into

by

into

by

into

although
this
polish
edition
has
been
censured
by
the
russian
government
it
is
now
being
rendered
into
norwegian
and
into

a

is
under
contemplation
a
russian
officer
now
a
prisoner
in
japan
has
a
manuscript
in
russian
ready
for
the
press
a
part
of
the
volume
has
been
brought
before
the
hungarian
public
and
a
detailed
review
almost
amounting
to
a
commentary
has
been
published
in
japanese
full
scholarly
notes
for
the
help
of
younger
students
have
been
compiled
by
my
friend
sakurai
to
whom
i
also
owe
much
for
his
aid
in
other
ways
i
have
been
more
than
gratified
to
feel
that
my
humble
work
has
found
sympathetic
readers
in
widely
separated
circles
showing
that
the
subject
matter
is
of
some
interest
to
the
world
at
large
exceedingly
flattering
is
the
news
that
has
reached
me
from
official
sources
that
president
roosevelt
has
done
it
undeserved
honor
by
reading
it
and
distributing
several
dozens
of
copies
among
his
friends
in
making
emendations
and
additions
for
the
present
edition
i
have
largely
confined
them
to
concrete
examples
i
still
continue
to
regret
as
i
indeed
have
never
ceased
to
do
my
inability
to
add
a
chapter
on
filial
piety
which
is
considered
one
of
the
two
wheels
of
the
chariot
of
japanese
ethics
loyalty
being
the
other
my
inability
is
due
rather
to
my
ignorance
of
the
western
sentiment
in
regard
to
this
particular
virtue
than
to
ignorance
of
our
own
attitude
towards
it
and
i
can
not
draw
comparisons
satisfying
to
my
own
mind
i
hope
one
day
to
enlarge
upon
this
and
other
topics
at
some
length
all
the
subjects
that
are
touched
upon
in
these
pages
are
capable
of
further
amplification
and
discussion
but
i
do
not
now
see
my
way
clear
to
make
this
volume
larger
than
it
is
this
preface
would
be
incomplete
and
unjust
if
i
were
to
omit
the
debt
i
owe
to
my
wife
for
her
reading
of
the
for
helpful
suggestions
and
above
all
for
her
constant
encouragement

bushido
as

chivalry
is
a
flower
no
less
indigenous
to
the
soil
of
japan
than
its
emblem
the
cherry
blossom
nor
is
it
a
specimen
of
an
antique
virtue
preserved
in
the
herbarium
of
our
history
it
is
still
a
living
object
of
power
and
beauty
among
us
and
if
it
assumes
no
tangible
shape
or
form
it
not
the
less
scents
the
moral
atmosphere
and
makes
us
aware
that
we
are
still
under
its
potent
spell
the
conditions
of
society
which
brought
it
forth
and
nourished
it
have
long
disappeared
but
as
those
stars
which
once
were
and
are
not
still
continue
to
shed
their
rays
upon
us
so
the
light
of
chivalry
which
was
a
child
of
feudalism
still
illuminates
our
moral
path
surviving
its
mother
institution
it
is
a
pleasure
to
me
to
reflect
upon
this
subject
in
the
language
of
burke
who
uttered
the
touching
eulogy
over
the
neglected
bier
of
its
european
prototype
it
argues
a
sad
defect
of
information
concerning
the
far
east
when
so
erudite
a
scholar
as
george
miller
did
not
hesitate
to
affirm
that
chivalry
or
any
other
similar
institution
has
never
existed
either
among
the
nations
of
antiquity
or
among
the
modern
orientals
such
ignorance
however
is
amply
excusable
as
the
third
edition
of
the
good
doctor
work
appeared
the
same
year
that
commodore
perry
was
knocking
at
the
portals
of
our
exclusivism
more
than
a
decade
later
about
the
time
that
our
feudalism
was
in
the
last
throes
of
existence
carl
marx
writing
his
capital
called
the
attention
of
his
readers
to
the
peculiar
advantage
of
studying
the
social
and
political
institutions
of
feudalism
as
then
to
be
seen
in
living
form
only
in
japan
i
would
likewise
invite
the
western
historical
and
ethical
student
to
the
study
of
chivalry
in
the
japan
of
the
present
footnote
philosophically
ed
vol
ii
p
enticing
as
is
a
historical
disquisition
on
the
comparison
between
european
and
japanese
feudalism
and
chivalry
it
is
not
the
purpose
of
this
paper
to
enter
into
it
at
length
my
attempt
is
rather
to
relate
the
origin
and
sources
of
our
chivalry
its
character
and
teaching
its
influence
among
the
masses
and
the
continuity
and
permanence
of
its
influence
of
these
several
points
the
first
will
be
only
brief
and
cursory
or
else
i
should
have
to
take
my
readers
into
the
devious
paths
of
our
national
history
the
second
will
be
dwelt
upon
at
greater
length
as
being
most
likely
to
interest
students
of
international
ethics
and
comparative
ethology
in
our
ways
of
thought
and
action
and
the
rest
will
be
dealt
with
as
corollaries
the
japanese
word
which
i
have
roughly
rendered
chivalry
is
in
the
original
more
expressive
than
horsemanship
means
literally
the
ways
which
fighting
nobles
should
observe
in
their
daily
life
as
well
as
in
their
vocation
in
a
word
the
precepts
of
knighthood
the
of
the
warrior
class
having
thus
given
its
literal
significance
i
may
be
allowed
henceforth
to
use
the
word
in
the
original
the
use
of
the
original
term
is
also
advisable
for
this
reason
that
a
teaching
so
circumscribed
and
unique
engendering
a
cast
of
mind
and
character
so
peculiar
so
local
must
wear
the
badge
of
its
singularity
on
its
face
then
some
words
have
a
national
so
expressive
of
race
characteristics
that
the
best
of
translators
can
do
them
but
scant
justice
not
to
say
positive
injustice
and
grievance
who
can
improve
by
translation
what
the
german
signifies
or
who
does
not
feel
the
difference
between
the
two
words
verbally
so
closely
allied
as
the
english
and
the
french
bushido
then
is
the
code
of
moral
principles
which
the
knights
were
required
or
instructed
to
observe
it
is
not
a
written
code
at
best
it
consists
of
a
few
maxims
handed
down
from
mouth
to
mouth
or
coming
from
the
pen
of
some
warrior
or
savant
more
frequently
it
is
a
code
unuttered
and
unwritten
possessing
all
the
more
the
powerful
sanction
of
veritable
deed
and
of
a
law
written
on
the
fleshly
tablets
of
the
heart
it
was
founded
not
on
the
creation
of
one
brain
however
able
or
on
the
life
of
a
single
personage
however
renowned
it
was
an
organic
growth
of
decades
and
centuries
of
military
career
it
perhaps
fills
the
same
position
in
the
history
of
ethics
that
the
english
constitution
does
in
political
history
yet
it
has
had
nothing
to
compare
with
the
magna
charta
or
the
habeas
corpus
act
true
early
in
the
seventeenth
century
military
statutes
were
promulgated
but
their
thirteen
short
articles
were
taken
up
mostly
with
marriages
castles
leagues
and
didactic
regulations
were
but
meagerly
touched
upon
we
can
not
therefore
point
out
any
definite
time
and
place
and
say
here
is
its
fountain
head
only
as
it
attains
consciousness
in
the
feudal
age
its
origin
in
respect
to
time
may
be
identified
with
feudalism
but
feudalism
itself
is
woven
of
many
threads
and
bushido
shares
its
intricate
nature
as
in
england
the
political
institutions
of
feudalism
may
be
said
to
date
from
the
norman
conquest
so
we
may
say
that
in
japan
its
rise
was
simultaneous
with
the
ascendency
of
yoritomo
late
in
the
twelfth
century
as
however
in
england
we
find
the
social
elements
of
feudalism
far
back
in
the
period
previous
to
william
the
conqueror
so
too
the
germs
of
feudalism
in
japan
had
been
long
existent
before
the
period
i
have
mentioned
again
in
japan
as
in
europe
when
feudalism
was
formally
inaugurated
the
professional
class
of
warriors
naturally
came
into
prominence
these
were
known
as
meaning
literally
like
the
old
english
knecht
knight
guards
or
attendants
resembling
in
character
the
whom
caesar
mentioned
as
existing
in
aquitania
or
the
who
according
to
tacitus
followed
germanic
chiefs
in
his
time
or
to
take
a
still
later
parallel
the
that
one
reads
about
in
the
history
of
mediaeval
europe
a
word
or
fighting
knights
was
also
adopted
in
common
use
they
were
a
privileged
class
and
must
originally
have
been
a
rough
breed
who
made
fighting
their
vocation
this
class
was
naturally
recruited
in
a
long
period
of
constant
warfare
from
the
manliest
and
the
most
adventurous
and
all
the
while
the
process
of
elimination
went
on
the
timid
and
the
feeble
being
sorted
out
and
only
a
rude
race
all
masculine
with
brutish
strength
to
borrow
emerson
phrase
surviving
to
form
families
and
the
ranks
of
the
coming
to
profess
great
honor
and
great
privileges
and
correspondingly
great
responsibilities
they
soon
felt
the
need
of
a
common
standard
of
behavior
especially
as
they
were
always
on
a
belligerent
footing
and
belonged
to
different
clans
just
as
physicians
limit
competition
among
themselves
by
professional
courtesy
just
as
lawyers
sit
in
courts
of
honor
in
cases
of
violated
etiquette
so
must
also
warriors
possess
some
resort
for
final
judgment
on
their
misdemeanors
fair
play
in
fight
what
fertile
germs
of
morality
lie
in
this
primitive
sense
of
savagery
and
childhood
is
it
not
the
root
of
all
military
and
civic
virtues
we
smile
as
if
we
had
outgrown
it
at
the
boyish
desire
of
the
small
britisher
tom
brown
to
leave
behind
him
the
name
of
a
fellow
who
never
bullied
a
little
boy
or
turned
his
back
on
a
big
one
and
yet
who
does
not
know
that
this
desire
is
the
on
which
moral
structures
of
mighty
dimensions
can
be
reared
may
i
not
go
even
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
gentlest
and
most
of
religions
endorses
this
aspiration
this
desire
of
tom
is
the
basis
on
which
the
greatness
of
england
is
largely
built
and
it
will
not
take
us
long
to
discover
that
does
not
stand
on
a
lesser
pedestal
if
fighting
in
itself
be
it
offensive
or
defensive
is
as
quakers
rightly
testify
brutal
and
wrong
we
can
still
say
with
lessing
we
know
from
what
failings
our
virtue
springs
sneaks
and
cowards
are
epithets
of
the
worst
opprobrium
to
healthy
simple
natures
childhood
begins
life
with
these
notions
and
knighthood
also
but
as
life
grows
larger
and
its
relations
the
early
faith
seeks
sanction
from
higher
authority
and
more
rational
sources
for
its
own
justification
satisfaction
and
development
if
military
interests
had
operated
alone
without
higher
moral
support
how
far
short

contemplation

it
to
be
convinced
of
a

that

all

thus
to
put
oneself
in

with

defined

was
more

the
calm
benignant
and
character
of
his
precepts
was
particularly
well
suited
to
the
samurai

formed
the
ruling

tone
was
well
adapted

the
requirements
of
these

exercised
an
immense
authority
over

his
forcible
and

quite
democratic
theories
were
exceedingly
taking
to
sympathetic
natures
and
they
were
even
thought
dangerous
to
and
subversive
of
the
existing

order
hence
his
works
were
for
a
long
time
under
censure
still
the
words
of
this
master
mind
found
permanent
lodgment
in
the
heart
of
the
samurai

of
confucius

formed
the
principal
for
youths
and
the
highest
authority

discussion

acquaintance
with
the

of
these
two

however
in
no

conceived
to

spiritual
and
ethical
bushido
could
not
accept
the
judgment
of
huxley
that
the
cosmic
process
was
unmoral
bushido
made
light
of
knowledge
as
such
it
was
not
pursued
as
an
end
in
itself
but
as
a
means
to
the
attainment
of
wisdom
hence
he
who
stopped
short
of
this
end
was
regarded
no
higher
than
a
convenient
machine
which
could
turn
out
poems
and
maxims
at

thus
knowledge
was
conceived
as
identical
with
its
practical
application
in
life
and
this
socratic
doctrine
found
its
greatest
exponent
in

do
these

some
passages
from

mystics
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
japanese
mind
as
expressed
in
the
simple
tenets
of
the
shinto
religion
was
particularly
open
to
the
reception
of
yang
precepts
he
carried
his
doctrine
of
the
infallibility
of
conscience
to
extreme
transcendentalism
attributing
to
it
the
faculty
to
perceive
not
only
the
distinction
between
right
and
wrong
but
also
the
nature
of
psychical
facts
and
physical
phenomena
he
went
as
far
as
if
not
farther
than
berkeley

fichte

the
existence
of
things
outside
of
human
ken
if
his

all

errors
charged

all
the
efficacy

is
to
speak

plains

pervading
characteristics
of
the
men
of
whom
de

mazelière
writes
let
us
now
address
ourselves
i
shall
begin
with
rectitude
or
justice
the
most
cogent
precept
in
the
code
of
the
samurai
nothing
is
more
loathsome
to
him
than
underhand
dealings
and
crooked
undertakings
the
conception
of
rectitude
may
be
erroneous
it
may
be
narrow
a
bushi
defines
it
as
a
power
of
resolution
rectitude
is
the
power
of
deciding
upon
a
certain
course
of
conduct
in
accordance
with
reason
without
wavering
to
die
when
it
is
right
to
die
to
strike
when
to
strike
is
right
another
speaks
of
it
in
the
following
terms
rectitude
is
the
bone
that
gives
firmness
and
stature
as
without
bones
the
head
can
not
rest
on
the
top
of
the
spine
nor
hands
move
nor
feet
stand
so
without
rectitude
neither
talent
nor
learning
can
make

a
human
frame
a

it
the
lack
of
accomplishments
is
as
nothing

calls

man

and
rectitude
or
righteousness
his
path
how
lamentable
he
exclaims
is
it
to
neglect
the
path
and
not
pursue
it
to
lose
the
mind
and
not
know
to
seek
it
again
when
men
fowls
and
dogs
are
lost
they
know
to
seek
for
them
again
but
they
lose
their
mind
and
do
not
know
to
seek
for
it
have
we
not
here
as
in
a
glass
darkly
a
parable
propounded
three
hundred
years
later
in
another
clime
and
by
a
greater
teacher
who
called
himself
of
righteousness
through
whom
the
lost
could
be
found
but
i
stray
from
my
point
righteousness
according
to
mencius
is
a
straight
and
narrow
path
which
a
man
ought
to
take
to
regain
the
lost
paradise
even
in
the
latter
days
of
feudalism
when
the
long
continuance
of
peace
brought
leisure
into
the
life
of
the
warrior
class
and
with
it
dissipations
of
all
kinds
and
gentle
accomplishments
the
epithet
a
man
of
rectitude
was
considered
superior
to
any
name
that
signified
mastery
of
learning
or
art
the
faithfuls
of
whom
so
much
is
made
in
our
popular
education
are
known
in
common
parlance
as
the
in
times

cunning

was
liable
to

tact

downright
falsehood
for
de
this
manly
virtue
frank
and
honest
was
a
jewel
that
shone
the
brightest
and
was
most
highly
praised
rectitude
is
a
twin
brother
to
valor
another
martial
virtue
but
before
proceeding
to
speak
of
valor
let
me
linger
a
little
while
on
what
i
may
term
a
derivation
from
rectitude
which
at
first
deviating
slightly
from
its
original
became
more
and
more
removed
from
it
until
its
meaning
was
perverted
in
the
popular
acceptance
i
speak
of
literally
the
right
reason
but
which
came
in
time
to
mean
a
vague
sense
of
duty
which
public
opinion
expected
an
incumbent
to
fulfil
in
its
original
and
unalloyed
sense
it
meant
duty
pure
and
simple
hence
we
speak
of
the
we
owe
to
parents
to
superiors
to
inferiors
to
society
at
large
and
so
forth
in
these
instances
is
duty
for
what
else
is
duty
than
what
right
reason
demands
and
commands
us
to
do
should
not
right
reason
be
our
categorical
imperative
primarily
meant
no
more
than
duty
and
i
dare
say
its
etymology
was
derived
from
the
fact
that
in
our
conduct
say
to
our
parents
though
love
should
be
the
only
motive
lacking
that
there
must
be
some
other
authority
to
enforce
filial
piety
and
they
formulated
this
authority
in
very
rightly
did
they
formulate
this
authority
since
if
love
does
not
rush
to
deeds
of
virtue
recourse
must
be
had
to
man
intellect
and
his
reason
must
be
quickened
to
convince
him
of
the
necessity
of
acting
aright
the
same
is
true
of
any
other
moral
obligation
the
instant
duty
becomes
onerous

reason

in

shirking

make
sluggards
perform
their
part
it
is
a
secondary
power
in
ethics
as
a
motive
it
is
infinitely
inferior
to
the
christian
doctrine
of
love
which
should
be
law
i
deem
it
a
product
of
the
conditions
of
an
artificial
society
of
a
society
in
which
accident
of
birth
and
unmerited
favour
instituted
class
distinctions
in
which
the
family
was
the
social
unit
in
which
seniority
of
age
was
of
more
account
than
superiority
of
talents
in
which
natural
affections
had
often
to
succumb
before
arbitrary
customs
because
of
this
very
artificiality
in
time
degenerated
into
a
vague
sense
of
propriety
called
up
to
explain
this
and
sanction
that
as
for
example
why
a
mother
must
if
need
be
sacrifice
all
her
other
children
in
order
to
save
the
or
why
a
daughter
must
sell
her
chastity
to
get
funds
to
pay
for
the
dissipation
and
the
like
starting
as
right
reason
has
in
my
opinion
often
stooped
to
casuistry
it
has
even
degenerated
into
cowardly
fear
of
censure
i
might
say
of
what
scott
wrote
of
patriotism
that
as
it
is
the
fairest
so
it
is
often
the
most
suspicious
mask
of
other
feelings
carried
beyond
or
below
right
reason
became
a
monstrous
misnomer
it
harbored
under
its
wings
every
sort
of
sophistry
and
hypocrisy
it
might
easily
have
been
turned
into
a
nest
of
cowardice
if
bushido
had
not
a
keen
and
correct
sense
of
courage
the
spirit
of
daring
and
bearing
to
the
consideration
of
which
we
shall
now
return
courage
was
scarcely
deemed
worthy
to
be
counted
among
virtues
unless
it
was
exercised
in
the
cause
of
righteousness
in
his
analects
confucius
defines
courage
by
explaining
as
is
often
his
wont
what
its
negative
is
perceiving
what
is
right
he
says
and
doing
it
not
argues
lack
of
courage
put
this
epigram
into
a
positive
statement
and
it
runs
courage
is
doing
what
is
right
to
run
all
kinds
of
hazards
to
jeopardize
one
self
to
rush
into
the
jaws
of
death
these
are
too
often
identified
with
valor
and
in
the
profession
of
arms
such
rashness
of
conduct
what
shakespeare
calls
valor
misbegot
is
unjustly
applauded
but
not
so
in
the
precepts
of
knighthood
death
for
a
cause
unworthy
of
dying
for
was
called
a
dog
death
to
rush
into
the
thick
of
battle
and
to
be
slain
in
it
says
a
prince
of
mito
is
easy
enough
and
the
merest
churl
is
equal
to
the
task
but
he
continues
it
is
true
courage
to
live
when
it
is
right
to
live
and
to
die
only
when
it
is
right
to
die
and
yet
the
prince
had
not
even
heard
of
the
name
of
plato
who
defines
courage
as
the
knowledge
of
things
that
a
man
should
fear
and
that
he
should
not
fear
a
distinction
which
is
made
in
the
west
between
moral
and
physical
courage
has
long
been
recognized
among
us
what
samurai
youth
has
not
heard
of
great
valor
and
the
valor
of
a
villein
valor
fortitude
bravery
fearlessness
courage
being
the
qualities
of
soul
which
appeal
most
easily
to
juvenile
minds
and
which
can
be
trained
by
exercise
and
example
were
so
to
speak
the
most
popular
virtues
early
emulated
among
the
youth
stories
of
military
exploits
were
repeated
almost
before
boys
left
their
mother
breast
does
a
little
booby
cry
for
any
ache
the
mother
scolds
him
in
this
fashion
what
a
coward
to
cry
for
a
trifling
pain
what
will
you
do
when
your
arm
is
cut
off
in
battle
what
when
you
are
called
upon
to
commit
we
all
know
the
pathetic
fortitude
of
a
famished
little
of
sendai
who
in
the
drama
is
made
to
say
to
his
little
page
seest
thou
those
tiny
sparrows
in
the
nest
how
their
yellow
bills
are
opened
wide
and
now
see
there
comes
their
mother
with
worms
to
feed
them
how
eagerly
and
happily
the
little
ones
eat
but
for
a
samurai
when
his
stomach
is
empty
it
is
a
disgrace
to
feel
hunger
anecdotes
of
fortitude
and
bravery
abound
in
nursery
tales
though
stories
of
this
kind
are
not
by
any
means
the
only
method
of
early
imbuing
the
spirit
with
daring
and
fearlessness
parents
with
sternness
sometimes
verging
on
cruelty
set
their
children
to
tasks
that
called
forth
all
the
pluck
that
was
in
them
bears
hurl
their
cubs
down
the
gorge
they
said
samurai
sons
were
let
down
the
steep
valleys
of
hardship
and
spurred
to
tasks
occasional
deprivation
of
food
or
exposure
to
cold
was
considered
a
highly
efficacious
test
for
inuring
them
to
endurance
children
of
tender
age
were
sent
among
utter
strangers
with
some
message
to
deliver
were
made
to
rise
before
the
sun
and
before
breakfast
attend
to
their
reading
exercises
walking
to
their
teacher
with
bare
feet
in
the
cold
of
winter
they
frequently
once
or
twice
a
month
as
on
the
festival
of
a
god
of
learning
came
together
in
small
groups
and
passed
the
night
without
sleep
in
reading
aloud
by
turns
pilgrimages
to
all
sorts
of
uncanny
places
to
execution
grounds
to
graveyards
to
houses
reputed
to
be
haunted
were
favorite
pastimes
of
the
young
in
the
days
when
decapitation
was
public
not
only
were
small
boys
sent
to
witness
the
ghastly
scene
but
they
were
made
to
visit
alone
the
place
in
the
darkness
of
night
and
there
to
leave
a
mark
of
their
visit
on
the
trunkless
head
does
this
system
of
drilling
the
nerves
strike
the
modern
pedagogist
with
horror
and
doubt
doubt
whether
the
tendency
would
not
be
brutalizing
nipping
in
the
bud
the
tender
emotions
of
the
heart
let
us
see
what
other
concepts
bushido
had
of
valor
the
spiritual
aspect
of
valor
is
evidenced
by
composure
calm
presence
of
mind
tranquillity
is
courage
in
repose
it
is
a
statical
manifestation
of
valor
as
daring
deeds
are
a
dynamical
a
truly
brave
man
is
ever
serene
he
is
never
taken
by
surprise
nothing
ruffles
the
equanimity
of
his
spirit
in
the
heat
of
battle
he
remains
cool
in
the
midst
of
catastrophes
he
keeps
level
his
mind
earthquakes
do
not
shake
him
he
laughs
at
storms
we
admire
him
as
truly
great
who
in
the
menacing
presence
of
danger
or
death
retains
his
who
for
instance
can
compose
a
poem
under
impending
peril
or
hum
a
strain
in
the
face
of
death
such
indulgence
betraying
no
tremor
in
the
writing
or
in
the
voice
is
taken
as
an
infallible
index
of
a
large
nature
of
what
we
call
a
capacious
mind
which
for
from
being
pressed
or
crowded
has
always
room
for
something
more
it
passes
current
among
us
as
a
piece
of
authentic
history
that
as
ōta
dokan
the
great
builder
of
the
castle
of
tokyo
was
pierced
through
with
a
spear
his
assassin
knowing
the
poetical
predilection
of
his
victim
accompanied
his
thrust
with
this
couplet
ah
how
in
moments
like
these
our
heart
doth
grudge
the
light
of
life
whereupon
the
expiring
hero
not
one
whit
daunted
by
the
mortal
wound
in
his
side
added
the
lines
had
not
in
hours
of
peace
it
learned
to
lightly
look
on
life
there
is
even
a
sportive
element
in
a
courageous
nature
things
which
are
serious
to
ordinary
people
may
be
but
play
to
the
valiant
hence
in
old
warfare
it
was
not
at
all
rare
for
the
parties
to
a
conflict
to
exchange
repartee
or
to
begin
a
rhetorical
contest
combat
was
not
solely
a
matter
of
brute
force
it
was
as
well
an
intellectual
engagement
of
such
character
was
the
battle
fought
on
the
bank
of
the
koromo
river
late
in
the
eleventh
century
the
eastern
army
routed
its
leader
sadato
took
to
flight
when
the
pursuing
general
pressed
him
hard
and
called
aloud
it
is
a
disgrace
for
a
warrior
to
show
his
back
to
the
enemy
sadato
reined
his
horse
upon
this
the
conquering
chief
shouted
an
impromptu
verse
torn
into
shreds
is
the
warp
of
the
cloth
scarcely
had
the
words
escaped
his
lips
when
the
defeated
warrior
undismayed
completed
the
couplet
since
age
has
worn
its
threads
by
use
yoshiie
whose
bow
had
all
the
while
been
bent
suddenly
unstrung
it
and
turned
away
leaving
his
prospective
victim
to
do
as
he
pleased
when
asked
the
reason
of
his
strange
behavior
he
replied
that
he
could
not
bear
to
put
to
shame
one
who
had
kept
his
presence
of
mind
while
hotly
pursued
by
his
enemy
the
sorrow
which
overtook
antony
and
octavius
at
the
death
of
brutus
has
been
the
general
experience
of
brave
men
kenshin
who
fought
for
fourteen
years
with
shingen
when
he
heard
of
the
latter
death
wept
aloud
at
the
loss
of
the
best
of
enemies
it
was
this
same
kenshin
who
had
set
a
noble
example
for
all
time
in
his
treatment
of
shingen
whose
provinces
lay
in
a
mountainous
region
quite
away
from
the
sea
and
who
had
consequently
depended
upon
the
hōjō
provinces
of
the
tokaido
for
salt
the
hōjō
prince
wishing
to
weaken
him
although
not
openly
at
war
with
him
had
cut
off
from
shingen
all
traffic
in
this
important
article
kenshin
hearing
of
his
enemy
dilemma
and
able
to
obtain
his
salt
from
the
coast
of
his
own
dominions
wrote
shingen
that
in
his
opinion
the
hōjō
lord
had
committed
a
very
mean
act
and
that
although
he
kenshin
was
at
war
with
him
shingen
he
had
ordered
his
subjects
to
furnish
him
with
plenty
of
salt
adding
i
do
not
fight
with
salt
but
with
the
sword
affording
more
than
a
parallel
to
the
words
of
camillus
we
romans
do
not
fight
with
gold
but
with
iron
nietzsche
spoke
for
the
samurai
heart
when
he
wrote
you
are
to
be
proud
of
your
enemy
then
the
success
of
your
enemy
is
your
success
also
indeed
valor
and
honor
alike
required
that
we
should
own
as
enemies
in
war
only
such
as
prove
worthy
of
being
friends
in
peace
when
valor
attains
this
height
it
becomes
akin
to
benevolence
the
feeling
of
distress
love
magnanimity
affection
for
others
sympathy
and
pity
which
were
ever
recognized
to
be
supreme
virtues
the
highest
of
all
the
attributes
of
the
human
soul
benevolence
was
deemed
a
princely
virtue
in
a
twofold
sense
princely
among
the
manifold
attributes
of
a
noble
spirit
princely
as
particularly
befitting
a
princely
profession
we
needed
no
shakespeare
to
feel
though
perhaps
like
the
rest
of
the
world
we
needed
him
to
express
it
that
mercy
became
a
monarch
better
than
his
crown
that
it
was
above
his
sceptered
sway
how
often
both
confucius
and
mencius
repeat
the
highest
requirement
of
a
ruler
of
men
to
consist
in
benevolence
confucius
would
say
let
but
a
prince
cultivate
virtue
people
will
flock
to
him
with
people
will
come
to
him
lands
lands
will
bring
forth
for
him
wealth
wealth
will
give
him
the
benefit
of
right
uses
virtue
is
the
root
and
wealth
an
outcome
again
never
has
there
been
a
case
of
a
sovereign
loving
benevolence
and
the
people
not
loving
righteousness
mencius
follows
close
at
his
heels
and
says
instances
are
on
record
where
individuals
attained
to
supreme
power
in
a
single
state
without
benevolence
but
never
have
i
heard
of
a
whole
empire
falling
into
the
hands
of
one
who
lacked
this
virtue
also
it
is
impossible
that
any
one
should
become
ruler
of
the
people
to
whom
they
have
not
yielded
the
subjection
of
their
hearts
both
defined
this
indispensable
requirement
in
a
ruler
by
saying
benevolence
benevolence
is
man
under
the
régime
of
feudalism
which
could
easily
be
perverted
into
militarism
it
was
to
benevolence
that
we
owed
our
deliverance
from
despotism
of
the
worst
kind
an
utter
surrender
of
life
and
limb
on
the
part
of
the
governed
would
have
left
nothing
for
the
governing
but
and
this
has
for
its
natural
consequence
the
growth
of
that
absolutism
so
often
called
oriental
despotism
as
though
there
were
no
despots
of
occidental
history
let
it
be
far
from
me
to
uphold
despotism
of
any
sort
but
it
is
a
mistake
to
identify
feudalism
with
it
when
frederick
the
great
wrote
that
kings
are
the
first
servants
of
the
state
jurists
thought
rightly
that
a
new
era
was
reached
in
the
development
of
freedom
strangely
coinciding
in
time
in
the
backwoods
of
japan
yozan
of
yonézawa
made
exactly
the
same
declaration
showing
that
feudalism
was
not
all
tyranny
and
oppression
a
feudal
prince
although
unmindful
of
owing
reciprocal
obligations
to
his
vassals
felt
a
higher
sense
of
responsibility
to
his
ancestors
and
to
heaven
he
was
a
father
to
his
subjects
whom
heaven
entrusted
to
his
care
in
a
sense
not
usually
assigned
to
the
term
bushido
accepted
and
corroborated
paternal
government
paternal
also
as
opposed
to
the
less
interested
avuncular
government
uncle
sam
to
wit
the
difference
between
a
despotic
and
a
paternal
government
lies
in
this
that
in
the
one
the
people
obey
reluctantly
while
in
the
other
they
do
so
with
that
proud
submission
that
dignified
obedience
that
subordination
of
heart
which
kept
alive
even
in
servitude
itself
the
spirit
of
exalted
freedom
the
old
saying
is
not
entirely
false
which
called
the
king
of
england
the
king
of
devils
because
of
his
subjects
often
insurrections
against
and
depositions
of
their
princes
and
which
made
the
french
monarch
the
king
of
asses
because
of
their
infinite
taxes
and
impositions
but
which
gave
the
title
of
the
king
of
men
to
the
sovereign
of
spain
because
of
his
subjects
willing
obedience
but
enough
footnote
burke
virtue
and
absolute
power
may
strike
the
mind
as
terms
which
it
is
impossible
to
harmonize
pobyedonostseff
has
clearly
set
before
us
the
contrast
in
the
foundations
of
english
and
other
european
communities
namely
that
these
were
organized
on
the
basis
of
common
interest
while
that
was
distinguished
by
a
strongly
developed
independent
personality
what
this
russian
statesman
says
of
the
personal
dependence
of
individuals
on
some
social
alliance
and
in
the
end
of
ends
of
the
state
among
the
continental
nations
of
europe
and
particularly
among
slavonic
peoples
is
doubly
true
of
the
japanese
hence
not
only
is
a
free
exercise
of
monarchical
power
not
felt
as
heavily
by
us
as
in
europe
but
it
is
generally
moderated
by
parental
consideration
for
the
feelings
of
the
people
absolutism
says
bismarck
primarily
demands
in
the
ruler
impartiality
honesty
devotion
to
duty
energy
and
inward
humility
if
i
may
be
allowed
to
make
one
more
quotation
on
this
subject
i
will
cite
from
the
speech
of
the
german
emperor
at
coblenz
in
which
he
spoke
of
kingship
by
the
grace
of
god
with
its
heavy
duties
its
tremendous
responsibility
to
the
creator
alone
from
which
no
man
no
minister
no
parliament
can
release
the
monarch
we
knew
benevolence
was
a
tender
virtue
and
if
upright
rectitude
and
stern
justice
were
peculiarly
masculine
mercy
had
the
gentleness
and
the
persuasiveness
of
a
feminine
nature
we
were
warned
against
indulging
in
indiscriminate
charity
without
seasoning
it
with
justice
and
rectitude
masamuné
expressed
it
well
in
his
aphorism
rectitude
carried
to
excess
hardens
into
stiffness
benevolence
indulged
beyond
measure
sinks
into
weakness
fortunately
mercy
was
not
so
rare
as
it
was
beautiful
for
it
is
universally
true
that
the
bravest
are
the
tenderest
the
loving
are
the
daring
no
the
tenderness
of
a
warrior
had
a
sound
which
appealed
at
once
to
whatever
was
noble
in
us
not
that
the
mercy
of
a
samurai
was
generically
different
from
the
mercy
of
any
other
being
but
because
it
implied
mercy
where
mercy
was
not
a
blind
impulse
but
where
it
recognized
due
regard
to
justice
and
where
mercy
did
not
remain
merely
a
certain
state
of
mind
but
where
it
was
backed
with
power
to
save
or
kill
as
economists
speak
of
demand
as
being
effectual
or
ineffectual
similarly
we
may
call
the
mercy
of
bushi
effectual
since
it
implied
the
power
of
acting
for
the
good
or
detriment
of
the
recipient
priding
themselves
as
they
did
in
their
brute
strength
and
privileges
to
turn
it
into
account
the
samurai
gave
full
consent
to
what
mencius
taught
concerning
the
power
of
love
benevolence
he
says
brings
under
its
sway
whatever
hinders
its
power
just
as
water
subdues
fire
they
only
doubt
the
power
of
water
to
quench
flames
who
try
to
extinguish
with
a
cupful
a
whole
burning
of
fagots
he
also
says
that
the
feeling
of
distress
is
the
root
of
benevolence
therefore
a
benevolent
man
is
ever
mindful
of
those
who
are
suffering
and
in
distress
thus
did
mencius
long
anticipate
adam
smith
who
founds
his
ethical
philosophy
on
sympathy
it
is
indeed
striking
how
closely
the
code
of
knightly
honor
of
one
country
coincides
with
that
of
others
in
other
words
how
the
much
abused
oriental
ideas
of
morals
find
their
counterparts
in
the
noblest
maxims
of
european
literature
if
the
lines

were
shown
a
japanese
gentleman
he
might
readily
accuse
the
mantuan
bard
of
plagiarizing
from
the
literature
of
his
own
country
benevolence
to
the
weak
the
downtrodden
or
the
vanquished
was
ever
extolled
as
peculiarly
becoming
to
a
samurai
lovers
of
japanese
art
must
be
familiar
with
the
representation
of
a
priest
riding
backwards
on
a
cow
the
rider
was
once
a
warrior
who
in
his
day
made
his
name
a
of
terror
in
that
terrible
battle
of
which
was
one
of
the
most
decisive
in
our
history
he
overtook
an
enemy
and
in
single
combat
had
him
in
the
clutch
of
his
gigantic
arms
now
the
etiquette
of
war
required
that
on
such
occasions
no
blood
should
be
spilt
unless
the
weaker
party
proved
to
be
a
man
of
rank
or
ability
equal
to
that
of
the
stronger
the
grim
combatant
would
have
the
name
of
the
man
under
him
but
he
refusing
to
make
it
known
his
helmet
was
ruthlessly
torn
off
when
the
sight
of
a
juvenile
face
fair
and
beardless
made
the
astonished
knight
relax
his
hold
helping
the
youth
to
his
feet
in
paternal
tones
he
bade
the
stripling
go
off
young
prince
to
thy
mother
side
the
sword
of
kumagaye
shall
never
be
tarnished
by
a
drop
of
thy
blood
haste
and
flee
yon
pass
before
thy
enemies
come
in
sight
the
young
warrior
refused
to
go
and
begged
kumagaye
for
the
honor
of
both
to
despatch
him
on
the
spot
above
the
hoary
head
of
the
veteran
gleams
the
cold
blade
which
many
a
time
before
has
sundered
the
chords
of
life
but
his
stout
heart
quails
there
flashes
athwart
his
mental
eye
the
vision
of
his
own
boy
who
this
day
marched
to
the
sound
of
bugle
to
try
his
maiden
arms
the
strong
hand
of
the
warrior
quivers
again
he
begs
his
victim
to
flee
for
his
life
finding
all
his
entreaties
vain
and
hearing
the
approaching
steps
of
his
comrades
he
exclaims
if
thou
art
overtaken
thou
mayest
fall
at
a
more
ignoble
hand
than
mine
o
thou
infinite
receive
his
soul
in
an
instant
the
sword
flashes
in
the
air
and
when
it
falls
it
is
red
with
adolescent
blood
when
the
war
is
ended
we
find
our
soldier
returning
in
triumph
but
little
cares
he
now
for
honor
or
fame
he
renounces
his
warlike
career
shaves
his
head
dons
a
priestly
garb
devotes
the
rest
of
his
days
to
holy
pilgrimage
never
turning
his
back
to
the
west
where
lies
the
paradise
whence
salvation
comes
and
whither
the
sun
hastes
daily
for
his
rest
critics
may
point
out
flaws
in
this
story
which
is
casuistically
vulnerable
let
it
be
all
the
same
it
shows
that
tenderness
pity
and
love
were
traits
which
adorned
the
most
sanguinary
exploits
of
the
samurai
it
was
an
old
maxim
among
them
that
it
becometh
not
the
fowler
to
slay
the
bird
which
takes
refuge
in
his
bosom
this
in
a
large
measure
explains
why
the
red
cross
movement
considered
peculiarly
christian
so
readily
found
a
firm
footing
among
us
for
decades
before
we
heard
of
the
geneva
convention

greatest
novelist

familiarized
us

for
its
martial
spirit

to
practice
music
not

blast
of
trumpets
or
the
beat
of
drums

clamorous
harbingers
of
blood
and
death
stirring
us
to
imitate
the
actions
of
a
tiger
but
sad
and
tender
melodies
on
the
soothing
our
fiery
spirits
drawing
our
thoughts
away
from
scent
of
blood
and
scenes
of
carnage
polybius
tells
us
of
the
constitution
of
arcadia
which
required
all
youths
under
thirty
to
practice
music
in
order
that
this
gentle
art
might
alleviate
the
rigors
of
that
inclement
region
it
is
to
its
influence
that
he
attributes
the
absence
of
cruelty
in
that
part

footnote
of
the
leisure
p
i
have
heard
slighting
remarks
made
by
europeans
upon
our
elaborate
discipline
of
politeness
it
has
been
criticized
as
absorbing
too
much
of
our
thought
and
in
so
far
a
folly
to
observe
strict
obedience
to
it
i
admit
that
there
may
be
unnecessary
niceties
in
ceremonious
etiquette
but
whether
it
partakes
as
much
of
folly
as
the
adherence
to
fashions
of
the
west
is
a
question
not
very
clear
to
my
mind
even
fashions
i
do
not
consider
solely
as
freaks
of
vanity
on
the
contrary
i
look
upon
these
as
a
ceaseless
search
of
the
human
mind
for
the
beautiful
much
less
do
i
consider
elaborate
ceremony
as
altogether
trivial
for
it
denotes
the
result
of
long
observation
as
to
the
most
appropriate
method
of
achieving
a
certain
result
if
there
is
anything
to
do
there
is
certainly
a
best
way
to
do
it
and
the
best
way
is
both
the
most
economical
and
the
most
graceful
spencer
defines
grace
as
the
most
economical
manner
of
motion
the
tea
ceremony
presents
certain
definite
ways
of
manipulating
a
bowl
a
spoon
a
napkin
etc
to
a
novice
it
looks
tedious
but
one
soon
discovers
that
the
way
prescribed
is
after
all
the
most
saving
of
time
and
labor
in
other
words
the
most
economical
use
of
force
hence
according
to
spencer
dictum
the
most
graceful
the
spiritual
significance
of
social
decorum
or
i
might
say
to
borrow
from
the
vocabulary
of
the
philosophy
of
clothes
the
spiritual
discipline
of
which
etiquette
and
ceremony
are
mere
outward
garments
is
out
of
all
proportion
to
what
their
appearance
warrants
us
in
believing
i
might
follow
the
example
of
spencer
and
trace
in
our
ceremonial
institutions
their
origins
and
the
moral
motives
that
gave
rise
to
them
but
that
is
not
what
i
shall
endeavor
to
do
in
this
book
it
is
the
moral
training
involved
in
strict
observance
of
propriety
that
i
wish
to
emphasize
i
have
said
that
etiquette
was
elaborated
into
the
finest
niceties
so
much
so
that
different
schools
advocating
different
systems
came
into
existence
but
they
all
united
in
the
ultimate
essential
and
this
was
put
by
a
great
exponent
of
the
best
known
school
of
etiquette
the
ogasawara
in
the
following
terms
the
end
of
all
etiquette
is
to
so
cultivate
your
mind
that
even
when
you
are
quietly
seated
not
the
roughest
ruffian
can
dare
make
onset
on
your
person
it
means
in
other
words
that
by
constant
exercise
in
correct
manners
one
brings
all
the
parts
and
faculties
of
his
body
into
perfect
order
and
into
such
harmony
with
itself
and
its
environment
as
to
express
the
mastery
of
spirit
over
the
flesh
what
a
new
and
deep
significance
the
french
word
comes
thus
to
contain
footnote
etymologically
if
the
premise
is
true
that
gracefulness
means
economy
of
force
then
it
follows
as
a
logical
sequence
that
a
constant
practice
of
graceful
deportment
must
bring
with
it
a
reserve
and
storage
of
force
fine
manners
therefore
mean
power

repose
when
the
barbarian

during
the
sack
of

burst
into
the
assembled
senate
and
dared
pull
the
beards
of
the
venerable
fathers

think
the
old
gentlemen
were
to
blame
inasmuch
as
they
lacked
dignity
and
strength
of
manners

lofty
spiritual
attainment
really
possible

why
not
all
roads
lead
to
rome
as
an
example
of
how
the
simplest
thing
can
be
made
into
an
art
and
then
become
spiritual
culture
i
may
take
the
tea
ceremony
as
a
fine
art
why
should
it
not
be
in
the
children
drawing
pictures
on
the
sand

in

savage
carving

rock

the
promise
of
a
raphael

a
michael

how
much
more
is
the
drinking
of
a
beverage
which
began
with
the
transcendental
contemplation
of
a
hindoo
anchorite

to
develop
into
a
handmaid
of
religion

that
calmness

serenity

our
attention
more

the
utmost
refinement
of
taste
is
the
object
aimed
at
whereas
anything
like
display
is
banished
with
religious
horror
the
very
fact
that
it
was
invented
by
a
contemplative
recluse
in
a
time
when
wars
and
the
rumors
of
wars
were
incessant

well
calculated
to
show
that
this
institution
was
more
than
a
pastime

him

instantly
his

is
down
and
he
stands
in
the
glaring
sun
also
how
foolish
yes
exactly
so
provided
the
motive
were
less
than
this
you
are
in
the
sun
i
sympathize
with
you
i
would
willingly
take
you
under
my
parasol
if
it
were
large
enough
or
if
we
were
familiarly
acquainted
as
i
can
not
shade
you
i
will
share
your
discomforts
little
acts
of
this
kind
equally
or
more
amusing
are
not
mere
gestures
or
conventionalities
they
are
the
bodying
forth
of
thoughtful
feelings
for
the
comfort
of
others
another
awfully
funny
custom
is
dictated
by
our
canons
of
politeness
but
many
superficial
writers
on
japan
have
dismissed
it
by
simply
attributing
it
to
the
general
of
the
nation
every
foreigner
who
has
observed
it
will
confess
the
awkwardness
he
felt
in
making
proper
reply
upon
the
occasion
in
america
when
you
make
a
gift
you
sing
its
praises
to
the
recipient
in
japan
we
depreciate
or
slander
it
the
underlying
idea
with
you
is
this
is
a
nice
gift
if
it
were
not
nice
i
would
not
dare
give
it
to
you
for
it
will
be
an
insult
to
give
you
anything
but
what
is
nice
in
contrast
to
this
our
logic
runs
you
are
a
nice
person
and
no
gift
is
nice
enough
for
you
you
will
not
accept
anything
i
can
lay
at
your
feet
except
as
a
token
of
my
good
will
so
accept
this
not
for
its
intrinsic
value
but
as
a
token
it
will
be
an
insult
to
your
worth
to
call
the
best
gift
good
enough
for
you
place
the
two
ideas
side
by
side
and
we
see
that
the
ultimate
idea
is
one
and
the
same
neither
is
awfully
funny
the
american
speaks
of
the
material
which
makes
the
gift
the
japanese
speaks
of
the
spirit
which
prompts
the
gift
it
is
perverse
reasoning
to
conclude
because
our
sense
of
propriety
shows
itself
in
all
the
smallest
ramifications
of
our
deportment
to
take
the
least
important
of
them
and
uphold
it
as
the
type
and
pass
judgment
upon
the
principle
itself
which
is
more
important
to
eat
or
to
observe
rules
of
propriety
about
eating
a
chinese
sage
answers
if
you
take
a
case
where
the
eating
is
and
the
observing
the
rules
of
propriety
is
of
little
importance
and
compare
them
together
why
merely
say
that
the
eating
is
of
the
more
importance
metal
is
heavier
than
feathers
but
does
that
saying
have
reference
to
a
single
clasp
of
metal
and
a
of
feathers
take
a
piece
of
wood
a
foot
thick
and
raise
it
above
the
pinnacle
of
a
temple
none
would
call
it
taller
than
the
temple
to
the
question
which
is
the
more
important
to
tell
the
truth
or
to
be
polite
the
japanese
are
said
to
give
an
answer
diametrically
opposite
to
what
the
american
will
say
but
i
forbear
any
comment
until
i
come
to
speak
of
veracity
or
truthfulness
without
which
politeness
is
a
farce
and
a
show
propriety
carried
beyond
right
bounds
says
masamuné
becomes
a
lie
an
ancient
poet
has
outdone
polonius
in
the
advice
he
gives
to
thyself
be
faithful
if
in
thy
heart
thou
strayest
not
from
truth
without
prayer
of
thine
the
gods
will
keep
thee
whole
the
apotheosis
of
sincerity
to
which
gives
expression
in
the
of
the
attributes
to
it
transcendental
powers
almost
identifying
them
with
the
divine
sincerity
is
the
end
and
the
beginning
of
all
things
without
sincerity
there
would
be
nothing
he
then
dwells
with
eloquence
on
its
and
long
enduring
nature
its
power
to
produce
changes
without
movement
and
by
its
mere
presence
to
accomplish
its
purpose
without
effort
from
the
chinese
ideogram
for
sincerity
which
is
a
combination
of
word
and
perfect
one
is
tempted
to
draw
a
parallel
between
it
and
the
doctrine
of
to
such
height
does
the
sage
soar
in
his
unwonted
mystic
flight
lying
or
equivocation
were
deemed
equally
cowardly
the
bushi
held
that
his
high
social
position
demanded
a
loftier
standard
of
veracity
than
that
of
the
tradesman
and
peasant
no
the
word
of
a
samurai
or
in
exact
german
equivalent
was
sufficient
guaranty
of
the
truthfulness
of
an
assertion
his
word
carried
such
weight
with
it
that
promises
were
generally
made
and
fulfilled
without
a
written
pledge
which
would
have
been
deemed
quite
beneath
his
dignity
many
thrilling
anecdotes
were
told
of
those
who
atoned
by
death
for
a
double
tongue
the
regard
for
veracity
was
so
high
that
unlike
the
generality
of
christians
who
persistently
violate
the
plain
commands
of
the
teacher
not
to
swear
the
best
of
samurai
looked
upon
an
oath
as
derogatory
to
their
honor
i
am
well
aware
that
they
did
swear
by
different
deities
or
upon
their
swords
but
never
has
swearing
degenerated
into
wanton
form
and
irreverent
interjection
to
emphasize
our
words
a
practice
of
literally
sealing
with
blood
was
sometimes
resorted
to
for
the
explanation
of
such
a
practice
i
need
only
refer
my
readers
to
faust
a
recent
american
writer
is
responsible
for
this
statement
that
if
you
ask
an
ordinary
japanese
which
is
better
to
tell
a
falsehood
or
be
impolite
he
will
not
hesitate
to
answer
to
tell
a
falsehood
peery
is
partly
right
and
partly
wrong
right
in
that
an
ordinary
japanese
even
a
samurai
may
answer
in
the
way
ascribed
to
him
but
wrong
in
attributing
too
much
weight
to
the
term
he
translates
falsehood
this
word
in
japanese
is
employed
to
denote
anything
which
is
not
a
truth
or
fact
lowell
tells
us
that
wordsworth
could
not
distinguish
between
truth
and
fact
and
an
ordinary
japanese
is
in
this
respect
as
good
as
wordsworth
ask
a
japanese
or
even
an
american
of
any
refinement
to
tell
you
whether
he
dislikes
you
or
whether
he
is
sick
at
his
stomach
and
he
will
not
hesitate
long
to
tell
falsehoods
and
answer
i
like
you
much
or
i
am
quite
well
thank
you
to
sacrifice
truth
merely
for
the
sake
of
politeness
was
regarded
as
an
empty
form
and
deception
by
sweet
words
and
was
never
justified
footnote
peery
gist
of
p
i
own
i
am
speaking
now
of
the
bushido
idea
of
veracity
but
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
devote
a
few
words
to
our
commercial
integrity
of
which
i
have
heard
much
complaint
in
foreign
books
and
journals
a
loose
business
morality
has
indeed
been
the
worst
blot
on
our
national
reputation
but
before
abusing
it
or
hastily
condemning
the
whole
race
for
it
let
us
calmly
study
it
and
we
shall
be
rewarded
with
consolation
for
the
future
of
all
the
great
occupations
of
life
none
was
farther
removed
from
the
profession
of
arms
than
commerce
the
merchant
was
placed
lowest
in
the
category
of
vocations
the
knight
the
tiller
of
the
soil
the
mechanic
the
merchant
the
samurai
derived
his
income
from
land
and
could
even
indulge
if
he
had
a
mind
to
in
amateur
farming
but
the
counter
and
abacus
were
abhorred
we
knew
the
wisdom
of
this
social
arrangement
montesquieu
has
made
it
clear
that
the
debarring
of
the
nobility
from
mercantile
pursuits
was
an
admirable
social
policy
in
that
it
prevented
wealth
from
accumulating
in
the
hands
of
the
powerful
the
separation
of
power
and
riches
kept
the
distribution
of
the
latter
more
nearly
equable
professor
dill
the
author
of
roman
society
in
the
last
century
of
the
western
empire
has
brought
afresh
to
our
mind
that
one
cause
of
the
decadence
of
the
roman
empire
was
the
permission
given
to
the
nobility
to
engage
in
trade
and
the
consequent
monopoly
of
wealth
and
power
by
a
minority
of
the
senatorial
families
commerce
therefore
in
feudal
japan
did
not
reach
that
degree
of
development
which
it
would
have
attained
under
freer
conditions
the
obloquy
attached
to
the
calling
naturally
brought
within
its
pale
such
as
cared
little
for
social
repute
call
one
a
thief
and
he
will
steal
put
a
stigma
on
a
calling
and
its
followers
adjust
their
morals
to
it
for
it
is
natural
that
the
normal
conscience
as
hugh
black
says
rises
to
the
demands
made
on
it
and
easily
falls
to
the
limit
of
the
standard
expected
from
it
it
is
unnecessary
to
add
that
no
business
commercial
or
otherwise
can
be
transacted
without
a
code
of
morals
our
merchants
of
the
feudal
period
had
one
among
themselves
without
which
they
could
never
have
developed
as
they
did
such
fundamental
mercantile
institutions
as
the
guild
the
bank
the
bourse
insurance
checks
bills
of
exchange
etc
but
in
their
relations
with
people
outside
their
vocation
the
tradesmen
lived
too
true
to
the
reputation
of
their
order
this
being
the
case
when
the
country
was
opened
to
foreign
trade
only
the
most
adventurous
and
unscrupulous
rushed
to
the
ports
while
the
respectable
business
houses
declined
for
some
time
the
repeated
requests
of
the
authorities
to
establish
branch
houses
was
bushido
powerless
to
stay
the
current
of
commercial
dishonor
let
us
see
those
who
are
well
acquainted
with
our
history
will
remember
that
only
a
few
years
after
our
treaty
ports
were
opened
to
foreign
trade
feudalism
was
abolished
and
when
with
it
the
samurai
fiefs
were
taken
and
bonds
issued
to
them
in
compensation
they
were
given
liberty
to
invest
them
in
mercantile
transactions
now
you
may
ask
why
could
they
not
bring
their
much
boasted
veracity
into
their
new
business
relations
and
so
reform
the
old
abuses
those
who
had
eyes
to
see
could
not
weep
enough
those
who
had
hearts
to
feel
could
not
sympathize
enough
with
the
fate
of
many
a
noble
and
honest
samurai
who
signally
and
irrevocably
failed
in
his
new
and
unfamiliar
field
of
trade
and
industry
through
sheer
lack
of
shrewdness
in
coping
with
his
artful
plebeian
rival
when
we
know
that
eighty
per
cent
of
the
business
houses
fail
in
so
industrial
a
country
as
america
is
it
any
wonder
that
scarcely
one
among
a
hundred
samurai
who
went
into
trade
could
succeed
in
his
new
vocation
it
will
be
long
before
it
will
be
recognized
how
many
fortunes
were
wrecked
in
the
attempt
to
apply
bushido
ethics
to
business
methods
but
it
was
soon
patent
to
every
observing
mind
that
the
ways
of
wealth
were
not
the
ways
of
honor
in
what
respects
then
were
they
different
of
the
three
incentives
to
veracity
that
lecky
enumerates
viz
the
industrial
the
political
and
the
philosophical
the
first
was
altogether
lacking
in
bushido
as
to
the
second
it
could
develop
little
in
a
political
community
under
a
feudal
system
it
is
in
its
philosophical
and
as
lecky
says
in
its
highest
aspect
that
honesty
attained
elevated
rank
in
our
catalogue
of
virtues
with
all
my
sincere
regard
for
the
high
commercial
integrity
of
the
race
when
i
ask
for
the
ultimate
ground
i
am
told
that
honesty
is
the
best
policy
that
it
to
be
honest
is
not
this
virtue
then
its
own
reward
if
it
is
followed
because
it
brings
in
more
cash
than
falsehood
i
am
afraid
bushido
would
rather
indulge
in
lies
if
bushido
rejects
a
doctrine
of
pro
rewards
the
shrewder
tradesman
will
readily
accept
it
lecky
has
very
truly
remarked
that
veracity
owes
its
growth
largely
to
commerce
and
manufacture
as
nietzsche
puts
it
honesty
is
the
youngest
of
virtues
in
other
words
it
is
the
of
industry
of
modern
industry
without
this
mother
veracity
was
like
a
orphan
whom
only
the
most
cultivated
mind
could
adopt
and
nourish
such
minds
were
general
among
the
samurai
but
for
want
of
a
more
democratic
and
utilitarian
the
tender
child
failed
to
thrive
industries
advancing
veracity
will
prove
an
easy
nay
a
profitable
virtue
to
practice
just
think
as
late
as
november
bismarck
sent
a
circular
to
the
professional
consuls
of
the
german
empire
warning
them
of
a
lamentable
lack
of
reliability
with
regard
to
german
shipments
apparent
both
as
to
quality
and
quantity
we
hear
comparatively
little
of
german
carelessness
and
dishonesty
in
trade
in
twenty
years
her
merchants
learned
that
in
the
end
honesty
pays
already
our
merchants
are
finding
that
out
for
the
rest
i
recommend
the
reader
to
two
recent
writers
for
judgment
on
this
point
it
is
interesting
to
remark
in
this
connection
that
integrity
and
honor
were
the
surest
guaranties
which
even
a
merchant
debtor
could
present
in
the
form
of
promissory
notes
it
was
quite
a
usual
thing
to
insert
such
clauses
as
these
in
default
of
the
repayment
of
the
sum
lent
to
me
i
shall
say
nothing
against
being
ridiculed
in
public
or
in
case
i
fail
to
pay
you
back
you
may
call
me
a
fool
and
the
like
footnote
knapp
and
modern
vol
i
ch
iv
ransome
in
ch
viii
often
have
i
wondered
whether
the
veracity
of
bushido
had
any
motive
higher
than
courage
in
the
absence
of
any
positive
commandment
against
bearing
false
witness
lying
was
not
condemned
as
sin
but
simply
denounced
as
weakness
and
as
such
highly
dishonorable
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
idea
of
honesty
is
so
intimately
blended
and
its
latin
and
its
german
etymology
so
identified
with
honor
that
it
is
high
time
i
should
pause
a
few
moments
for
the
consideration
of
this
feature
of
the
precepts
of
knighthood
the
sense
of
honor
implying
a
vivid
consciousness
of
personal
dignity
and
worth
could
not
fail
to
characterize
the
samurai
born
and
bred
to
value
the
duties
and
privileges
of
their
profession
though
the
word
ordinarily
given
as
the
translation
of
honor
was
not
used
freely
yet
the
idea
was
conveyed
by
such
terms
as
name
countenance
outside
hearing
reminding
us
respectively
of
the
biblical
use
of
name
of
the
evolution
of
the
term
personality
from
the
greek
mask
and
of
fame
a
good
name
reputation
the
immortal
part
of
one
self
what
remains
being
bestial
assumed
as
a
matter
of
course
any
infringement
upon
its
integrity
was
felt
as
shame
and
the
sense
of
shame
was
one
of
the
earliest
to
be
cherished
in
juvenile
education
you
will
be
laughed
at
it
will
disgrace
you
are
you
not
ashamed
were
the
last
appeal
to
correct
behavior
on
the
part
of
a
youthful
delinquent
such
a
recourse
to
his
honor
touched
the
most
sensitive
spot
in
the
child
heart
as
though
it
had
been
nursed
on
honor
while
it
was
in
its
mother
womb
for
most
truly
is
honor
a
prenatal
influence
being
closely
bound
up
with
strong
family
consciousness
in
losing
the
solidarity
of
families
says
balzac
society
has
lost
the
fundamental
force
which
montesquieu
named
honor
indeed
the
sense
of
shame
seems
to
me
to
be
the
earliest
indication
of
the
moral
consciousness
of
our
race
the
first
and
worst
punishment
which
befell
humanity
in
consequence
of
tasting
the
fruit
of
that
forbidden
tree
was
to
my
mind
not
the
sorrow
of
childbirth
nor
the
thorns
and
thistles
but
the
awakening
of
the
sense
of
shame
few
incidents
in
history
excel
in
pathos
the
scene
of
the
first
mother
plying
with
heaving
breast
and
tremulous
fingers
her
crude
needle
on
the
few
fig
leaves
which
her
dejected
husband
plucked
for
her
this
first
fruit
of
disobedience
clings
to
us
with
a
tenacity
that
nothing
else
does
all
the
sartorial
ingenuity
of
mankind
has
not
yet
succeeded
in
sewing
an
apron
that
will
efficaciously
hide
our
sense
of
shame
that
samurai
was
right
who
refused
to
compromise
his
character
by
a
slight
humiliation
in
his
youth
because
he
said
dishonor
is
like
a
scar
on
a
tree
which
time
instead
of
effacing
only
helps
to
enlarge
mencius
had
taught
centuries
before
in
almost
the
identical
phrase
what
carlyle
has
latterly
expressed
namely
that
shame
is
the
soil
of
all
virtue
of
good
manners
and
good
morals
the
fear
of
disgrace
was
so
great
that
if
our
literature
lacks
such
eloquence
as
shakespeare
puts
into
the
mouth
of
norfolk
it
nevertheless
hung
like
damocles
sword
over
the
head
of
every
samurai
and
often
assumed
a
morbid
character
in
the
name
of
honor
deeds
were
perpetrated
which
can
find
no
justification
in
the
code
of
bushido
at
the
slightest
nay
imaginary
insult
the
braggart
took
offense
resorted
to
the
use
of
the
sword
and
many
an
unnecessary
strife
was
raised
and
many
an
innocent
life
lost
the
story
of
a
citizen
who
called
the
attention
of
a
bushi
to
a
flea
jumping
on
his
back
and
who
was
forthwith
cut
in
two
for
the
simple
and
questionable
reason
that
inasmuch
as
fleas
are
parasites
which
feed
on
animals
it
was
an
unpardonable
insult
to
identify
a
noble
warrior
with
a
beast
i
say
stories
like
these
are
too
frivolous
to
believe
yet
the
circulation
of
such
stories
implies
three
things
that
they
were
invented
to
overawe
common
people
that
abuses
were
really
made
of
the
samurai
profession
of
honor
and
that
a
very
strong
sense
of
shame
was
developed
among
them
it
is
plainly
unfair
to
take
an
abnormal
case
to
cast
blame
upon
the
precepts
any
more
than
to
judge
of
the
true
teaching
of
christ
from
the
fruits
of
religious
fanaticism
and
extravagance
inquisitions
and
hypocrisy
but
as
in
religious
monomania
there
is
something
touchingly
noble
as
compared
with
the
delirium
tremens
of
a
drunkard
so
in
that
extreme
sensitiveness
of
the
samurai
about
their
honor
do
we
not
recognize
the
substratum
of
a
genuine
virtue
the
morbid
excess
into
which
the
delicate
code
of
honor
was
inclined
to
run
was
strongly
counterbalanced
by
preaching
magnanimity
and
patience
to
take
offense
at
slight
provocation
was
ridiculed
as
the
popular
adage
said
to
bear
what
you
think
you
can
not
bear
is
really
to
bear
the
great
iyéyasu
left
to
posterity
a
few
maxims
among
which
are
the
following
the
life
of
man
is
like
going
a
long
distance
with
a
heavy
load
upon
the
shoulders
haste
not
reproach
none
but
be
forever
watchful
of
thine
own
forbearance
is
the
basis
of
length
of
days
he
proved
in
his
life
what
he
preached
a
literary
wit
put
a
characteristic
epigram
into
the
mouths
of
three
personages
in
our
history
to
nobunaga
he
attributed
i
will
kill
her
if
the
nightingale
sings
not
in
time
to
hidéyoshi
i
will
force
her
to
sing
for
me
and
to
iyéyasu
i
will
wait
till
she
opens
her
lips
patience
and
long
suffering
were
also
highly
commended
by
mencius
in
one
place
he
writes
to
this
effect
though
you
denude
yourself
and
insult
me
what
is
that
to
me
you
can
not
defile
my
soul
by
your
outrage
elsewhere
he
teaches
that
anger
at
a
petty
offense
is
unworthy
a
superior
man
but
indignation
for
a
great
cause
is
righteous
wrath
to
what
height
of
unmartial
and
unresisting
meekness
bushido
could
reach
in
some
of
its
votaries
may
be
seen
in
their
utterances
take
for
instance
this
saying
of
ogawa
when
others
speak
all
manner
of
evil
things
against
thee
return
not
evil
for
evil
but
rather
reflect
that
thou
wast
not
more
faithful
in
the
discharge
of
thy
duties
take
another
of
kumazawa
when
others
blame
thee
blame
them
not
when
others
are
angry
at
thee
return
not
anger
joy
cometh
only
as
passion
and
desire
part
still
another
instance
i
may
cite
from
saigo
upon
whose
overhanging
brows
shame
is
ashamed
to
sit
the
way
is
the
way
of
heaven
and
earth
man
place
is
to
follow
it
therefore
make
it
the
object
of
thy
life
to
reverence
heaven
heaven
loves
me
and
others
with
equal
love
therefore
with
the
love
wherewith
thou
lovest
thyself
love
others
make
not
man
thy
partner
but
heaven
and
making
heaven
thy
partner
do
thy
best
never
condemn
others
but
see
to
it
that
thou
comest
not
short
of
thine
own
mark
some
of
those
sayings
remind
us
of
christian
expostulations
and
show
us
how
far
in
practical
morality
natural
religion
can
approach
the
revealed
not
only
did
these
sayings
remain
as
utterances
but
they
were
really
embodied
in
acts
it
must
be
admitted
that
very
few
attained
this
sublime
height
of
magnanimity
patience
and
forgiveness
it
was
a
great
pity
that
nothing
clear
and
general
was
expressed
as
to
what
constitutes
honor
only
a
few
enlightened
minds
being
aware
that
it
from
no
condition
rises
but
that
it
lies
in
each
acting
well
his
part
for
nothing
was
easier
than
for
youths
to
forget
in
the
heat
of
action
what
they
had
learned
in
mencius
in
their
calmer
moments
said
this
sage
is
in
every
mind
to
love
honor
but
little
doth
he
dream
that
what
is
truly
honorable
lies
within
himself
and
not
anywhere
else
the
honor
which
men
confer
is
not
good
honor
those
whom
châo
the
great
ennobles
he
can
make
mean
again
for
the
most
part
an
insult
was
quickly
resented
and
repaid
by
death
as
we
shall
see
later
while
honor
too
often
nothing
higher
than
vain
glory
or
worldly
approbation
was
prized
as
the
of
earthly
existence
fame
and
not
wealth
or
knowledge
was
the
goal
toward
which
youths
had
to
strive
many
a
lad
swore
within
himself
as
he
crossed
the
threshold
of
his
paternal
home
that
he
would
not
recross
it
until
he
had
made
a
name
in
the
world
and
many
an
ambitious
mother
refused
to
see
her
sons
again
unless
they
could
return
home
as
the
expression
is
caparisoned
in
brocade
to
shun
shame
or
win
a
name
samurai
boys
would
submit
to
any
privations
and
undergo
severest
ordeals
of
bodily
or
mental
suffering
they
knew
that
honor
won
in
youth
grows
with
age
in
the
memorable
siege
of
osaka
a
young
son
of
iyéyasu
in
spite
of
his
earnest
entreaties
to
be
put
in
the
vanguard
was
placed
at
the
rear
of
the
army
when
the
castle
fell
he
was
so
chagrined
and
wept
so
bitterly
that
an
old
councillor
tried
to
console
him
with
all
the
resources
at
his
command
take
comfort
sire
said
he
at
thought
of
the
long
future
before
you
in
the
many
years
that
you
may
live
there
will
come
divers
occasions
to
distinguish
yourself
the
boy
fixed
his
indignant
gaze
upon
the
man
and
said
how
foolishly
you
talk
can
ever
my
fourteenth
year
come
round
again
life
itself
was
thought
cheap
if
honor
and
fame
could
be
attained
therewith
hence
whenever
a
cause
presented
itself
which
was
considered
dearer
than
life
with
utmost
serenity
and
celerity
was
life
laid
down
of
the
causes
in
comparison
with
which
no
life
was
too
dear
to
sacrifice
was
the
duty
of
loyalty
which
was
the
making
feudal
virtues
a
symmetrical
arch
other
virtues
feudal
morality
shares
in
common
with
other
systems
of
ethics
with
other
classes
of
people
but
this
virtue
homage
and
fealty
to
a
superior
is
its
distinctive
feature
i
am
aware
that
personal
fidelity
is
a
moral
adhesion
existing
among
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
men
a
gang
of
pickpockets
owe
allegiance
to
a
fagin
but
it
is
only
in
the
code
of
chivalrous
honor
that
loyalty
assumes
paramount
importance
in
spite
of
hegel
criticism
that
the
fidelity
of
feudal
vassals
being
an
obligation
to
an
individual
and
not
to
a
commonwealth
is
a
bond
established
on
totally
unjust
principles
a
great
compatriot
of
his
made
it
his
boast
that
personal
loyalty
was
a
german
virtue
bismarck
had
good
reason
to
do
so
not
because
the
he
boasts
of
was
the
monopoly
of
his
fatherland
or
of
any
single
nation
or
race
but
because
this
favored
fruit
of
chivalry
lingers
latest
among
the
people
where
feudalism
has
lasted
longest
in
america
where
everybody
is
as
good
as
anybody
else
and
as
the
irishman
added
better
too
such
exalted
ideas
of
loyalty
as
we
feel
for
our
sovereign
may
be
deemed
excellent
within
certain
bounds
but
preposterous
as
encouraged
among
us
montesquieu
complained
long
ago
that
right
on
one
side
of
the
pyrenees
was
wrong
on
the
other
and
the
recent
dreyfus
trial
proved
the
truth
of
his
remark
save
that
the
pyrenees
were
not
the
sole
boundary
beyond
which
french
justice
finds
no
accord
similarly
loyalty
as
we
conceive
it
may
find
few
admirers
elsewhere
not
because
our
conception
is
wrong
but
because
it
is
i
am
afraid
forgotten
and
also
because
we
carry
it
to
a
degree
not
reached
in
any
other
country
griffis
was
quite
right
in
stating
that
whereas
in
china
confucian
ethics
made
obedience
to
parents
the
primary
human
duty
in
japan
precedence
was
given
to
loyalty
at
the
risk
of
shocking
some
of
my
good
readers
i
will
relate
of
one
who
could
endure
to
follow
a
lord
and
who
thus
as

assures
earned
a
place
i
the

footnote
of
the
story
is
of
one
of
the
purest
characters
in
our
history
michizané
who
falling
a
victim
to
jealousy
and
calumny
is
exiled
from
the
capital
not
content
with
this
his
unrelenting
enemies
are
now
bent
upon
the
extinction
of
his
family
strict
search
for
his
son
not
yet
grown
reveals
the
fact
of
his
being
secreted
in
a
village
school
kept
by
one
genzo
a
former
vassal
of
michizané
when
orders
are
dispatched
to
the
schoolmaster
to
deliver
the
head
of
the
juvenile
offender
on
a
certain
day
his
first
idea
is
to
find
a
suitable
substitute
for
it
he
ponders
over
his
scrutinizes
with
careful
eyes
all
the
boys
as
they
stroll
into
the
but
none
among
the
children
born
of
the
soil
bears
the
least
resemblance
to
his
protégé
his
despair
however
is
but
for
a
moment
for
behold
a
new
scholar
is
announced
a
comely
boy
of
the
same
age
as
his
master
son
escorted
by
a
mother
of
noble
mien
no
less
conscious
of
the
resemblance
between
infant
lord
and
infant
retainer
were
the
mother
and
the
boy
himself
in
the
privacy
of
home
both
had
laid
themselves
upon
the
altar
the
one
his
life
the
other
her
heart
yet
without
sign
to
the
outer
world
unwitting
of
what
had
passed
between
them
it
is
the
teacher
from
whom
comes
the
suggestion
here
then
is
the
the
rest
of
the
narrative
may
be
briefly
on
the
day
appointed
arrives
the
officer
commissioned
to
identify
and
receive
the
head
of
the
youth
will
he
be
deceived
by
the
false
head
the
poor
genzo
hand
is
on
the
hilt
of
the
sword
ready
to
strike
a
blow
either
at
the
man
or
at
himself
should
the
examination
defeat
his
scheme
the
officer
takes
up
the
gruesome
object
before
him
goes
calmly
over
each
feature
and
in
a
deliberate
tone
pronounces
it
that
evening
in
a
lonely
home
awaits
the
mother
we
saw
in
the
school
does
she
know
the
fate
of
her
child
it
is
not
for
his
return
that
she
watches
with
eagerness
for
the
opening
of
the
wicket
her
has
been
for
a
long
time
a
recipient
of
michizané
bounties
but
since
his
banishment
circumstances
have
forced
her
husband
to
follow
the
service
of
the
enemy
of
his
benefactor
he
himself
could
not
be
untrue
to
his
own
cruel
master
but
his
son
could
serve
the
cause
of
the
grandsire
lord
as
one
acquainted
with
the
exile
family
it
was
he
who
had
been
entrusted
with
the
task
of
identifying
the
boy
head
now
the
day
yea
the
life
hard
work
is
done
he
returns
home
and
as
he
crosses
its
threshold
he
accosts
his
wife
saying
rejoice
my
wife
our
darling
son
has
proved
of
service
to
his
lord
what
an
atrocious
story
i
hear
my
readers
exclaim
parents
deliberately
sacrificing
their
own
innocent
child
to
save
the
life
of
another
man
but
this
child
was
a
conscious
and
willing
victim
it
is
a
story
of
vicarious
death
as
significant
as
and
not
more
revolting
than
the
story
of
abraham
intended
sacrifice
of
isaac
in
both
cases
it
was
obedience
to
the
call
of
duty
utter
submission
to
the
command
of
a
higher
voice
whether
given
by
a
visible
or
an
invisible
angel
or
heard
by
an
outward
or
an
inward
ear
but
i
abstain
from
preaching
the
individualism
of
the
west
which
recognizes
separate
interests
for
father
and
son
husband
and
wife
necessarily
brings
into
strong
relief
the
duties
owed
by
one
to
the
other
but
bushido
held
that
the
interest
of
the
family
and
of
the
members
thereof
is
intact
one
and
inseparable
this
interest
it
bound
up
with
affection
natural
instinctive
irresistible
hence
if
we
die
for
one
we
love
with
natural
love
which
animals
themselves
possess
what
is
that
for
if
ye
love
them
that
love
you
what
reward
have
ye
do
not
even
the
publicans
the
same
in
his
great
history
sanyo
relates
in
touching
language
the
heart
struggle
of
shigemori
concerning
his
father
rebellious
conduct
if
i
be
loyal
my
father
must
be
undone
if
i
obey
my
father
my
duty
to
my
sovereign
must
go
amiss
poor
shigemori
we
see
him
afterward
praying
with
all
his
soul
that
kind
heaven
may
visit
him
with
death
that
he
may
be
released
from
this
world
where
it
is
hard
for
purity
and
righteousness
to
dwell
many
a
shigemori
has
his
heart
torn
by
the
conflict
between
duty
and
affection
indeed
neither
shakespeare
nor
the
old
testament
itself
contains
an
adequate
rendering
of
our
conception
of
filial
piety
and
yet
in
such
conflicts
bushido
never
wavered
in
its
choice
of
loyalty
women
too
encouraged
their
offspring
to
sacrifice
all
for
the
king
ever
as
resolute
as
widow
windham
and
her
illustrious
consort
the
samurai
matron
stood
ready
to
give
up
her
boys
for
the
cause
of
loyalty
since
bushido
like
aristotle
and
some
modern
sociologists
conceived
the
state
as
antedating
the
individual
the
latter
being
born
into
the
former
as
part
and
parcel
thereof
he
must
live
and
die
for
it
or
for
the
incumbent
of
its
legitimate
authority
readers
of
crito
will
remember
the
argument
with
which
socrates
represents
the
laws
of
the
city
as
pleading
with
him
on
the
subject
of
his
escape
among
others
he
makes
them
the
laws
or
the
state
say
since
you
were
begotten
and
nurtured
and
educated
under
us
dare
you
once
to
say
you
are
not
our
offspring
and
servant
you
and
your
fathers
before
you
these
are
words
which
do
not
impress
us
as
any
thing
extraordinary
for
the
same
thing
has
long
been
on
the
lips
of
bushido
with
this
modification
that
the
laws
and
the
state
were
represented
with
us
by
a
personal
being
loyalty
is
an
ethical
outcome
of
this
political
theory
i
am
not
entirely
ignorant
of
spencer
view
according
to
which
political
obedience
loyalty
is
accredited
with
only
a
transitional
function
it
may
be
so
sufficient
unto
the
day
is
the
virtue
thereof
we
may
complacently
repeat
it
especially
as
we
believe
day
to
be
a
long
space
of
time
during
which
so
our
national
anthem
says
tiny
pebbles
grow
into
mighty
rocks
draped
with
moss
we
may
remember
at
this
juncture
that
even
among
so
democratic
a
people
as
the
english
the
sentiment
of
personal
fidelity
to
a
man
and
his
posterity
which
their
germanic
ancestors
felt
for
their
chiefs
has
as
monsieur
boutmy
recently
said
only
passed
more
or
less
into
their
profound
loyalty
to
the
race
and
blood
of
their
princes
as
evidenced
in
their
extraordinary
attachment
to
the
dynasty

loyalty
and
its
concomitant

disappear
forever
we
transfer
our
allegiance
from

master
to
another
without
being
unfaithful

a
few
years
ago
a
very
stupid
controversy
started
by
the
misguided
disciples
of
spencer
made
havoc
among
the
reading
class
of
japan
in
their
zeal
to
uphold
the
claim
of
the
throne
to
undivided
loyalty
they
charged
christians
with
treasonable
propensities
in
that
they
avow
fidelity
to
their
lord
and
master
they
arrayed
forth
sophistical
arguments
without
the
wit
of
sophists
and
scholastic
tortuosities
minus
the
niceties
of
the
schoolmen
little
did
they
know
that
we
can
in
a
sense
serve
two
masters
without
holding
to
the
one
or
despising
the
other
rendering
unto
caesar
the
things
that
are
caesar
and
unto
god
the
things
that
are
god
did
not
socrates
all
the
while
he
unflinchingly
refused
to
concede
one
iota
of
loyalty
to
his
obey
with
equal
fidelity
and
equanimity
the
command
of
his
earthly
master
the
state
his
conscience
he
followed
alive
his
country
he
served
dying
alack
the
day
when
a
state
grows
so
powerful
as
to
demand
of
its
citizens
the
dictates
of
their
conscience
bushido
did
not
require
us
to
make
our
conscience
the
slave
of
any
lord
or
king
thomas
mowbray
was
a
veritable
spokesman
for
us
when
he
said
myself
i
throw
dread
sovereign
at
thy
foot
my
life
thou
shalt
command
but
not
my
shame
the
one
my
duty
owes
but
my
fair
name
despite
of
death
that
lives
upon
my
grave
to
dark
dishonor
use
thou
shalt
not
have
a
man
who
sacrificed
his
own
conscience
to
the
capricious
will
or
freak
or
fancy
of
a
sovereign
was
accorded
a
low
place
in
the
estimate
of
the
precepts
such
an
one
was
despised
as
a
cringeling
who
makes
court
by
unscrupulous
fawning
or
as
a
favorite
who
steals
his
master
affections
by
means
of
servile
compliance
these
two
species
of
subjects
corresponding
exactly
to
those
which
iago
describes
the
one
a
duteous
and
knave
doting
on
his
own
obsequious
bondage
wearing
out
his
time
much
like
his
master
ass
the
other
trimm
in
forms
and
visages
of
duty
keeping
yet
his
heart
attending
on
himself
when
a
subject
differed
from
his
master
the
loyal
path
for
him
to
pursue
was
to
use
every
available
means
to
persuade
him
of
his
error
as
kent
did
to
king
lear
failing
in
this
let
the
master
deal
with
him
as
he
wills
in
cases
of
this
kind
it
was
quite
a
usual
course
for
the
samurai
to
make
the
last
appeal
to
the
intelligence
and
conscience
of
his
lord
by
demonstrating
the
sincerity
of
his
words
with
the
shedding
of
his
own
blood
life
being
regarded
as
the
means
whereby
to
serve
his
master
and
its
ideal
being
set
upon
honor
the
whole
education
and
training
of
a
samurai
were
conducted
accordingly
the
first
point
to
observe
in
knightly
pedagogics
was
to
build
up
character
leaving
in
the
shade
the
subtler
faculties
of
prudence
intelligence
and
dialectics
we
have
seen
the
important
part
aesthetic
accomplishments
played
in
his
education
indispensable
as
they
were
to
a
man
of
culture
they
were
accessories
rather
than
essentials
of
samurai
training
intellectual
superiority
was
of
course
esteemed
but
the
word
which
was
employed
to
denote
intellectuality
meant
wisdom
in
the
first
instance
and
placed
knowledge
only
in
a
very
subordinate
place
the
tripod
that
supported
the
framework
of
bushido
was
said
to
be
respectively
wisdom
benevolence
and
courage
a
samurai
was
essentially
a
man
of
action
science
was
without
the
pale
of
his
activity
he
took
advantage
of
it
in
so
far
as
it
concerned
his
profession
of
arms
religion
and
theology
were
relegated
to
the
priests
he
concerned
himself
with
them
in
so
far
as
they
helped
to
nourish
courage
like
an
english
poet
the
samurai
believed
is
not
the
creed
that
saves
the
man
but
it
is
the
man
that
justifies
the
creed
philosophy
and
literature
formed
the
chief
part
of
his
intellectual
training
but
even
in
the
pursuit
of
these
it
was
not
objective
truth
that
he
strove
after
literature
was
pursued
mainly
as
a
pastime
and
philosophy
as
a
practical
aid
in
the
formation
of
character
if
not
for
the
exposition
of
some
military
or
political
problem
from
what
has
been
said
it
will
not
be
surprising
to
note
that
the
curriculum
of
studies
according
to
the
pedagogics
of
bushido
consisted
mainly
of
the
following
fencing
archery
or
horsemanship
the
use
of
the
spear
tactics
caligraphy
ethics
literature
and
history
of
these
and
caligraphy
may
require
a
few
words
of
explanation
great
stress
was
laid
on
good
writing
probably
because
our
logograms
partaking
as
they
do
of
the
nature
of
pictures
possess
artistic
value
and
also
because
chirography
was
accepted
as
indicative
of
one
personal
character
may
be
briefly
defined
as
an
application
of
anatomical
knowledge
to
the
purpose
of
offense
or
defense
it
differs
from
wrestling
in
that
it
does
not
depend
upon
muscular
strength
it
differs
from
other
forms
of
attack
in
that
it
uses
no
weapon
its
feat
consists
in
clutching
or
striking
such
part
of
the
enemy
body
as
will
make
him
numb
and
incapable
of
resistance
its
object
is
not
to
kill
but
to
incapacitate
one
for
action
for
the
time
being
a
subject
of
study
which
one
would
expect
to
find
in
military
education
and
which
is
rather
conspicuous
by
its
absence
in
the
bushido
course
of
instruction
is
mathematics
this
however
can
be
readily
explained
in
part
by
the
fact
that
feudal
warfare
was
not
carried
on
with
scientific
precision
not
only
that
but
the
whole
training
of
the
samurai
was
unfavorable
to
fostering
numerical
notions
chivalry
is
uneconomical
it
boasts
of
penury
it
says
with
ventidius
that
ambition
the
soldier
virtue
rather
makes
choice
of
loss
than
gain
which
darkens
him
don
quixote
takes
more
pride
in
his
rusty
spear
and
horse
than
in
gold
and
lands
and
a
samurai
is
in
hearty
sympathy
with
his
exaggerated
confrère
of
la
mancha
he
disdains
money
itself
the
art
of
making
or
hoarding
it
it
is
to
him
veritably
filthy
lucre
the
hackneyed
expression
to
describe
the
decadence
of
an
age
is
that
the
civilians
loved
money
and
the
soldiers
feared
death
niggardliness
of
gold
and
of
life
excites
as
much
disapprobation
as
their
lavish
use
is
panegyrized
less
than
all
things
says
a
current
precept
men
must
grudge
money
it
is
by
riches
that
wisdom
is
hindered
hence
children
were
brought
up
with
utter
disregard
of
economy
it
was
considered
bad
taste
to
speak
of
it
and
ignorance
of
the
value
of
different
coins
was
a
token
of
good
breeding
knowledge
of
numbers
was
indispensable
in
the
mustering
of
forces
as
well
as
in
the
distribution
of
benefices
and
fiefs
but
the
counting
of
money
was
left
to
meaner
hands
in
many
feudatories
public
finance
was
administered
by
a
lower
kind
of
samurai
or
by
priests
every
thinking
bushi
knew
well
enough
that
money
formed
the
sinews
of
war
but
he
did
not
think
of
raising
the
appreciation
of
money
to
a
virtue
it
is
true
that
thrift
was
enjoined
by
bushido
but
not
for
economical
reasons
so
much
as
for
the
exercise
of
abstinence
luxury
was
thought
the
greatest
menace
to
manhood
and
severest
simplicity
was
required
of
the
warrior
class
sumptuary
laws
being
enforced
in
many
of
the
clans
we
read
that
in
ancient
rome
the
farmers
of
revenue
and
other
financial
agents
were
gradually
raised
to
the
rank
of
knights
the
state
thereby
showing
its
appreciation
of
their
service
and
of
the
importance
of
money
itself
how
closely
this
was
connected
with
the
luxury
and
avarice
of
the
romans
may
be
imagined
not
so
with
the
precepts
of
knighthood
these
persisted
in
systematically
regarding
finance
as
something
low
low
as
compared
with
moral
and
intellectual
vocations
money
and
the
love
of
it
being
thus
diligently
ignored
bushido
itself
could
long
remain
free
from
a
thousand
and
one
evils
of
which
money
is
the
root
this
is
sufficient
reason
for
the
fact
that
our
public
men
have
long
been
free
from
corruption
but
alas
how
fast
plutocracy
is
making
its
way
in
our
time
and
generation
the
mental
discipline
which
would
be
chiefly
aided
by
the
study
of
mathematics
was
supplied
by
literary
exegesis
and
deontological
discussions
very
few
abstract
subjects
troubled
the
mind
of
the
young
the
chief
aim
of
their
education
being
as
i
have
said
decision
of
character
people
whose
minds
were
simply
stored
with
information
found
no
great
admirers
of
the
three
services
of
studies
that
bacon
gives
for
delight
ornament
and
ability
bushido
had
decided
preference
for
the
last
where
their
use
was
in
judgment
and
the
disposition
of
business
whether
it
was
for
the
disposition
of
public
business
or
for
the
exercise
of
it
was
with
a
practical
end
in
view
that
education
was
conducted
learning
without
thought
said
confucius
is
labor
lost
thought
without
learning
is
perilous
when
character
and
not
intelligence
when
the
soul
and
not
the
head
is
chosen
by
a
teacher
for
the
material
to
work
upon
and
to
develop
his
vocation
partakes
of
a
sacred
character
it
is
the
parent
who
has
borne
me
it
is
the
teacher
who
makes
me
man
with
this
idea
therefore
the
esteem
in
which
one
preceptor
was
held
was
very
high
a
man
to
evoke
such
confidence
and
respect
from
the
young
must
necessarily
be
endowed
with
superior
personality
without
lacking
erudition
he
was
a
father
to
the
fatherless
and
an
adviser
to
the
erring
thy
father
and
thy
mother
so
runs
our
maxim
are
like
heaven
and
earth
thy
teacher
and
thy
lord
are
like
the
sun
and
moon
the
present
system
of
paying
for
every
sort
of
service
was
not
in
vogue
among
the
adherents
of
bushido
it
believed
in
a
service
which
can
be
rendered
only
without
money
and
without
price
spiritual
service
be
it
of
priest
or
teacher
was
not
to
be
repaid
in
gold
or
silver
not
because
it
was
valueless
but
because
it
was
invaluable
here
the
of
bushido
taught
a
truer
lesson
than
modern
political
economy
for
wages
and
salaries
can
be
paid
only
for
services
whose
results
are
definite
tangible
and
measurable
whereas
the
best
service
done
in
education
namely
in
soul
development
and
this
includes
the
services
of
a
pastor
is
not
definite
tangible
or
measurable
being
immeasurable
money
the
ostensible
measure
of
value
is
of
inadequate
use
usage
sanctioned
that
pupils
brought
to
their
teachers
money
or
goods
at
different
seasons
of
the
year
but
these
were
not
payments
but
offerings
which
indeed
were
welcome
to
the
recipients
as
they
were
usually
men
of
stern
calibre
boasting
of
honorable
penury
too
dignified
to
work
with
their
hands
and
too
proud
to
beg
they
were
grave
personifications
of
high
spirits
undaunted
by
adversity
they
were
an
embodiment
of
what
was
considered
as
an
end
of
all
learning
and
were
thus
a
living
example
of
that
discipline
of
disciplines
which
was
universally
required
of
samurai
the
discipline
of
fortitude
on
the
one
hand
inculcating
endurance
without
a
groan
and
the
teaching
of
politeness
on
the
other
requiring
us
not
to
mar
the
pleasure
or
serenity
of
another
by
manifestations
of
our
own
sorrow
or
pain
combined
to
engender
a
stoical
turn
of
mind
and
eventually
to
confirm
it
into
a
national
trait
of
apparent
stoicism
i
say
apparent
stoicism
because
i
do
not
believe
that
true
stoicism
can
ever
become
the
characteristic
of
a
whole
nation
and
also
because
some
of
our
national
manners
and
customs
may
seem
to
a
foreign
observer
yet
we
are
really
as
susceptible
to
tender
emotion
as
any
race
under
the
sky
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
in
one
sense
we
have
to
feel
more
than
others
yes
doubly
more
since
the
very
attempt
to
restrain
natural
promptings
entails
suffering
imagine
boys
and
girls
too
brought
up
not
to
resort
to
the
shedding
of
a
tear
or
the
uttering
of
a
groan
for
the
relief
of
their
feelings
and
there
is
a
physiological
problem
whether
such
effort
steels
their
nerves
or
makes
them
more
sensitive
it
was
considered
unmanly
for
a
samurai
to
betray
his
emotions
on
his
face
he
shows
no
sign
of
joy
or
anger
was
a
phrase
used
in
describing
a
strong
character
the
most
natural
affections
were
kept
under
control
a
father
could
embrace
his
son
only
at
the
expense
of
his
dignity
a
husband
would
not
kiss
his
wife
no
not
in
the
presence
of
other
people
whatever
he
might
do
in
private
there
may
be
some
truth
in
the
remark
of
a
witty
youth
when
he
said
american
husbands
kiss
their
wives
in
public
and
beat
them
in
private
japanese
husbands
beat
theirs
in
public
and
kiss
them
in
private
calmness
of
behavior
composure
of
mind
should
not
be
disturbed
by
passion
of
any
kind
i
remember
when
during
the
late
war
with
china
a
regiment
left
a
certain
town
a
large
concourse
of
people
flocked
to
the
station
to
bid
farewell
to
the
general
and
his
army
on
this
occasion
an
american
resident
resorted
to
the
place
expecting
to
witness
loud
demonstrations
as
the
nation
itself
was
highly
excited
and
there
were
fathers
mothers
and
sweethearts
of
the
soldiers
in
the
crowd
the
american
was
strangely
disappointed
for
as
the
whistle
blew
and
the
train
began
to
move
the
hats
of
thousands
of
people
were
silently
taken
off
and
their
heads
bowed
in
reverential
farewell
no
waving
of
handkerchiefs
no
word
uttered
but
deep
silence
in
which
only
an
attentive
ear
could
catch
a
few
broken
sobs
in
domestic
life
too
i
know
of
a
father
who
spent
whole
nights
listening
to
the
breathing
of
a
sick
child
standing
behind
the
door
that
he
might
not
be
caught
in
such
an
act
of
parental
weakness
i
know
of
a
mother
who
in
her
last
moments
refrained
from
sending
for
her
son
that
he
might
not
be
disturbed
in
his
studies
our
history
and
everyday
life
are
replete
with
examples
of
heroic
matrons
who
can
well
bear
comparison
with
some
of
the
most
touching
pages
of
plutarch
among
our
peasantry
an
ian
maclaren
would
be
sure
to
find
many
a
marget
howe
it
is
the
same
discipline
of
which
is
accountable
for
the
absence
of
more
frequent
revivals
in
the
christian
churches
of
japan
when
a
man
or
woman
feels
his
or
her
soul
stirred
the
first
instinct
is
to
quietly
suppress
any
indication
of
it
in
rare
instances
is
the
tongue
set
free
by
an
irresistible
spirit
when
we
have
eloquence
of
sincerity
and
fervor
it
is
putting
a
premium
upon
a
breach
of
the
third
commandment
to
encourage
speaking
lightly
of
spiritual
experience
it
is
truly
jarring
to
japanese
ears
to
hear
the
most
sacred
words
the
most
secret
heart
experiences
thrown
out
in
promiscuous
audiences
dost
thou
feel
the
soil
of
thy
soul
stirred
with
tender
thoughts
it
is
time
for
seeds
to
sprout
disturb
it
not
with
speech
but
let
it
work
alone
in
quietness
and
secrecy
writes
a
young
samurai
in
his
diary
to
give
in
so
many
articulate
words
one
inmost
thoughts
and
feelings
notably
the
religious
is
taken
among
us
as
an
unmistakable
sign
that
they
are
neither
very
profound
nor
very
sincere
only
a
pomegranate
is
he
so
runs
a
popular
saying
who
when
he
gapes
his
mouth
displays
the
contents
of
his
heart
it
is
not
altogether
perverseness
of
oriental
minds
that
the
instant
our
emotions
are
moved
we
try
to
guard
our
lips
in
order
to
hide
them
speech
is
very
often
with
us
as
the
frenchman
defined
it
the
art
of
concealing
thought
call
upon
a
japanese
friend
in
time
of
deepest
affliction
and
he
will
invariably
receive
you
laughing
with
red
eyes
or
moist
cheeks
at
first
you
may
think
him
hysterical
press
him
for
explanation
and
you
will
get
a
few
broken
commonplaces
human
life
has
sorrow
they
who
meet
must
part
he
that
is
born
must
die
it
is
foolish
to
count
the
years
of
a
child
that
is
gone
but
a
woman
heart
will
indulge
in
follies
and
the
like
so
the
noble
words
of
a
noble
hohenzollern
lerne
zu
leiden
ohne
klagen
had
found
many
responsive
minds
among
us
long
before
they
were
uttered
indeed
the
japanese
have
recourse
to
risibility
whenever
the
frailties
of
human
nature
are
put
to
severest
test
i
think
we
possess
a
better
reason
than
democritus
himself
for
our
abderian
tendency
for
laughter
with
us
oftenest
veils
an
effort
to
regain
balance
of
temper
when
disturbed
by
any
untoward
circumstance
it
is
a
counterpoise
of
sorrow
or
rage
the
suppression
of
feelings
being
thus
steadily
insisted
upon
they
find
their
in
poetical
aphorism
a
poet
of
the
tenth
century
writes
in
japan
and
china
as
well
humanity
when
moved
by
sorrow
tells
its
bitter
grief
in
verse
a
mother
who
tries
to
console
her
broken
heart
by
fancying
her
departed
child
absent
on
his
wonted
chase
after
the
hums
how
far
in
chase
i
wonder
has
gone
my
hunter
of
the
i
refrain
from
quoting
other
examples
for
i
know
i
could
do
only
scant
justice
to
the
pearly
gems
of
our
literature
were
i
to
render
into
a
foreign
tongue
the
thoughts
which
were
wrung
drop
by
drop
from
bleeding
hearts
and
threaded
into
beads
of
rarest
value
i
hope
i
have
in
a
measure
shown
that
inner
working
of
our
minds
which
often
presents
an
appearance
of
callousness
or
of
an
hysterical
mixture
of
laughter
and
dejection
and
whose
sanity
is
sometimes
called
in
question
it
has
also
been
suggested
that
our
endurance
of
pain
and
indifference
to
death
are
due
to
less
sensitive
nerves
this
is
plausible
as
far
as
it
goes
the
next
question
is
why
are
our
nerves
less
tightly
strung
it
may
be
our
climate
is
not
so
stimulating
as
the
american
it
may
be
our
monarchical
form
of
government
does
not
excite
us
as
much
as
the
republic
does
the
frenchman
it
may
be
that
we
do
not
read
as
zealously
as
the
englishman
personally
i
believe
it
was
our
very
excitability
and
sensitiveness
which
made
it
a
necessity
to
recognize
and
enforce
constant
but
whatever
may
be
the
explanation
without
taking
into
account
long
years
of
discipline
in
none
can
be
correct
discipline
in
can
easily
go
too
far
it
can
well
repress
the
genial
current
of
the
soul
it
can
force
pliant
natures
into
distortions
and
monstrosities
it
can
beget
bigotry
breed
hypocrisy
or
hebetate
affections
be
a
virtue
never
so
noble
it
has
its
counterpart
and
counterfeit
we
must
recognize
in
each
virtue
its
own
positive
excellence
and
follow
its
positive
ideal
and
the
ideal
of
is
to
keep
our
mind
as
our
expression
is
or
to
borrow
a
greek
term
attain
the
state
of
which
democritus
called
the
highest
good
the
acme
of
is
reached
and
best
illustrated
in
the
first
of
the
two
institutions
which
we
shall
now
bring
to
view
namely
the
institutions
of
suicide
and
redress
of
which
the
former
known
as
and
the
latter
as
many
foreign
writers
have
treated
more
or
less
fully
to
begin
with
suicide
let
me
state
that
i
confine
my
observations
only
to
or
popularly
known
as
which
means
by
disembowelment
ripping
the
abdomen
how
absurd
so
cry
those
to
whom
the
name
is
new
absurdly
odd
as
it
may
sound
at
first
to
foreign
ears
it
can
not
be
so
very
foreign
to
students
of
shakespeare
who
puts
these
words
in
brutus
mouth
thy
caesar
spirit
walks
abroad
and
turns
our
swords
into
our
proper
entrails
listen
to
a
modern
english
poet
who
in
his
of
speaks
of
a
sword
piercing
the
bowels
of
a
queen
none
blames
him
for
bad
english
or
breach
of
modesty
or
to
take
still
another
example
look
at
guercino
painting
of
cato
death
in
the
palazzo
rossa
in
genoa
whoever
has
read
the
which
addison
makes
cato
sing
will
not
jeer
at
the
sword
in
his
abdomen
in
our
minds
this
mode
of
death
is
associated
with
instances
of
noblest
deeds
and
of
most
touching
pathos
so
that
nothing
repugnant
much
less
ludicrous
mars
our
conception
of
it
so
wonderful
is
the
transforming
power
of
virtue
of
greatness
of
tenderness
that
the
vilest
form
of
death
assumes
a
sublimity
and
becomes
a
symbol
of
new
life
or
else
the
sign
which
constantine
beheld
would
not
conquer
the
world
not
for
extraneous
associations
only
does
lose
in
our
mind
any
taint
of
absurdity
for
the
choice
of
this
particular
part
of
the
body
to
operate
upon
was
based
on
an
old
anatomical
belief
as
to
the
seat
of
the
soul
and
of
the
affections
when
moses
wrote
of
joseph
bowels
yearning
upon
his
brother
or
david
prayed
the
lord
not
to
forget
his
bowels
or
when
isaiah
jeremiah
and
other
inspired
men
of
old
spoke
of
the
sounding
or
the
troubling
of
bowels
they
all
and
each
endorsed
the
belief
prevalent
among
the
japanese
that
in
the
abdomen
was
enshrined
the
soul
the
semites
habitually
spoke
of
the
liver
and
kidneys
and
surrounding
fat
as
the
seat
of
emotion
and
of
life
the
term
was
more
comprehensive
than
the
greek
or
and
the
japanese
and
hellenese
alike
thought
the
spirit
of
man
to
dwell
somewhere
in
that
region
such
a
notion
is
by
no
means
confined
to
the
peoples
of
antiquity
the
french
in
spite
of
the
theory
propounded
by
one
of
their
most
distinguished
philosophers
descartes
that
the
soul
is
located
in
the
pineal
gland
still
insist
in
using
the
term
in
a
sense
which
if
anatomically
too
vague
is
nevertheless
physiologically
significant
similarly
stands
in
their
language
for
affection
and
compassion
nor
is
such
belief
mere
superstition
being
more
scientific
than
the
general
idea
of
making
the
heart
the
centre
of
the
feelings
without
asking
a
friar
the
japanese
knew
better
than
romeo
in
what
vile
part
of
this
anatomy
one
name
did
lodge
modern
neurologists
speak
of
the
abdominal
and
pelvic
brains
denoting
thereby
sympathetic
in
those
parts
which
are
strongly
affected
by
any
psychical
action
this
view
of
mental
physiology
once
admitted
the
syllogism
of
is
easy
to
construct
i
will
open
the
seat
of
my
soul
and
show
you
how
it
fares
with
it
see
for
yourself
whether
it
is
polluted
or
clean
i
do
not
wish
to
be
understood
as
asserting
religious
or
even
moral
justification
of
suicide
but
the
high
estimate
placed
upon
honor
was
ample
excuse
with
many
for
taking
one
own
life
how
many
acquiesced
in
the
sentiment
expressed
by
garth
when
honor
lost
is
a
relief
to
die
death
but
a
sure
retreat
from
infamy
and
have
smilingly
surrendered
their
souls
to
oblivion
death
when
honor
was
involved
was
accepted
in
bushido
as
a
key
to
the
solution
of
many
complex
problems
so
that
to
an
ambitious
samurai
a
natural
departure
from
life
seemed
a
rather
tame
affair
and
a
consummation
not
devoutly
to
be
wished
for
i
dare
say
that
many
good
christians
if
only
they
are
honest
enough
will
confess
the
fascination
of
if
not
positive
admiration
for
the
sublime
composure
with
which
cato
brutus
petronius
and
a
host
of
other
ancient
worthies
terminated
their
own
earthly
existence
is
it
too
bold
to
hint
that
the
death
of
the
first
of
the
philosophers
was
partly
suicidal
when
we
are
told
so
minutely
by
his
pupils
how
their
master
willingly
submitted
to
the
mandate
of
the
state
which
he
knew
was
morally
mistaken
in
spite
of
the
possibilities
of
escape
and
how
he
took
up
the
cup
of
hemlock
in
his
own
hand
even
offering
libation
from
its
deadly
contents
do
we
not
discern
in
his
whole
proceeding
and
demeanor
an
act
of
no
physical
compulsion
here
as
in
ordinary
cases
of
execution
true
the
verdict
of
the
judges
was
compulsory
it
said
thou
shalt
die
and
that
by
thy
own
hand
if
suicide
meant
no
more
than
dying
by
one
own
hand
socrates
was
a
clear
case
of
suicide
but
nobody
would
charge
him
with
the
crime
plato
who
was
averse
to
it
would
not
call
his
master
a
suicide
now
my
readers
will
understand
that
was
not
a
mere
suicidal
process
it
was
an
institution
legal
and
ceremonial
an
invention
of
the
middle
ages
it
was
a
process
by
which
warriors
could
expiate
their
crimes
apologize
for
errors
escape
from
disgrace
redeem
their
friends
or
prove
their
sincerity
when
enforced
as
a
legal
punishment
it
was
practiced
with
due
ceremony
it
was
a
refinement
of
and
none
could
perform
it
without
the
utmost
coolness
of
temper
and
composure
of
demeanor
and
for
these
reasons
it
was
particularly
befitting
the
profession
of
bushi
antiquarian
curiosity
if
nothing
else
would
tempt
me
to
give
here
a
description
of
this
obsolete
ceremonial
but
seeing
that
such
a
description
was
made
by
a
far
abler
writer
whose
book
is
not
much
read
i
am
tempted
to
make
a
somewhat
lengthy
quotation
mitford
in
his
tales
of
old
japan
after
giving
a
translation
of
a
treatise
on
from
a
rare
japanese
manuscript
goes
on
to
describe
an
instance
of
such
an
execution
of
which
he
was
an
we
seven
foreign
representatives
were
invited
to
follow
the
japanese
witness
into
the
or
main
hall
of
the
temple
where
the
ceremony
was
to
be
performed
it
was
an
imposing
scene
a
large
hall
with
a
high
roof
supported
by
dark
pillars
of
wood
from
the
ceiling
hung
a
profusion
of
those
huge
gilt
lamps
and
ornaments
peculiar
to
buddhist
temples
in
front
of
the
high
altar
where
the
floor
covered
with
beautiful
white
mats
is
raised
some
three
or
four
inches
from
the
ground
was
laid
a
rug
of
scarlet
felt
tall
candles
placed
at
regular
intervals
gave
out
a
dim
mysterious
light
just
sufficient
to
let
all
the
proceedings
be
seen
the
seven
japanese
took
their
places
on
the
left
of
the
raised
floor
the
seven
foreigners
on
the
right
no
other
person
was
present
after
the
interval
of
a
few
minutes
of
anxious
suspense
taki
zenzaburo
a
stalwart
man
years
of
age
with
a
noble
air
walked
into
the
hall
attired
in
his
dress
of
ceremony
with
the
peculiar
wings
which
are
worn
on
great
occasions
he
was
accompanied
by
a
and
three
officers
who
wore
the
or
war
surcoat
with
gold
tissue
facings
the
word
it
should
be
observed
is
one
to
which
our
word
executioner
is
no
equivalent
term
the
office
is
that
of
a
gentleman
in
many
cases
it
is
performed
by
a
kinsman
or
friend
of
the
condemned
and
the
relation
between
them
is
rather
that
of
principal
and
second
than
that
of
victim
and
executioner
in
this
instance
the
was
a
pupil
of
taki
zenzaburo
and
was
selected
by
friends
of
the
latter
from
among
their
own
number
for
his
skill
in
swordsmanship
with
the
on
his
left
hand
taki
zenzaburo
advanced
slowly
towards
the
japanese
witnesses
and
the
two
bowed
before
them
then
drawing
near
to
the
foreigners
they
saluted
us
in
the
same
way
perhaps
even
with
more
deference
in
each
case
the
salutation
was
ceremoniously
returned
slowly
and
with
great
dignity
the
condemned
man
mounted
on
to
the
raised
floor
prostrated
himself
before
the
high
altar
twice
and
seated
himself
on
the
felt
carpet
with
his
back
to
the
high
altar
the
crouching
on
his
left
hand
side
one
of
the
three
attendant
officers
then
came
forward
bearing
a
stand
of
the
kind
used
in
the
temple
for
offerings
on
which
wrapped
in
paper
lay
the
the
short
sword
or
dirk
of
the
japanese
nine
inches
and
a
half
in
length
with
a
point
and
an
edge
as
sharp
as
a
razor
this
he
handed
prostrating
himself
to
the
condemned
man
who
received
it
reverently
raising
it
to
his
head
with
both
hands
and
placed
it
in
front
of
himself
footnote
seated
himself
that
is
in
the
japanese
fashion
his
knees
and
toes
touching
the
ground
and
his
body
resting
on
his
heels
in
this
position
which
is
one
of
respect
he
remained
until
his
death
after
another
profound
obeisance
taki
zenzaburo
in
a
voice
which
betrayed
just
so
much
emotion
and
hesitation
as
might
be
expected
from
a
man
who
is
making
a
painful
confession
but
with
no
sign
of
either
in
his
face
or
manner
spoke
as
follows
and
i
alone
unwarrantably
gave
the
order
to
fire
on
the
foreigners
at
kobe
and
again
as
they
tried
to
escape
for
this
crime
i
disembowel
myself
and
i
beg
you
who
are
present
to
do
me
the
honor
of
witnessing
the
act
bowing
once
more
the
speaker
allowed
his
upper
garments
to
slip
down
to
his
girdle
and
remained
naked
to
the
waist
carefully
according
to
custom
he
tucked
his
sleeves
under
his
knees
to
prevent
himself
from
falling
backward
for
a
noble
japanese
gentleman
should
die
falling
forwards
deliberately
with
a
steady
hand
he
took
the
dirk
that
lay
before
him
he
looked
at
it
wistfully
almost
affectionately
for
a
moment
he
seemed
to
collect
his
thoughts
for
the
last
time
and
then
stabbing
himself
deeply
below
the
waist
in
the
side
he
drew
the
dirk
slowly
across
to
his
right
side
and
turning
it
in
the
wound
gave
a
slight
cut
upwards
during
this
sickeningly
painful
operation
he
never
moved
a
muscle
of
his
face
when
he
drew
out
the
dirk
he
leaned
forward
and
stretched
out
his
neck
an
expression
of
pain
for
the
first
time
crossed
his
face
but
he
uttered
no
sound
at
that
moment
the
who
still
crouching
by
his
side
had
been
keenly
watching
his
every
movement
sprang
to
his
feet
poised
his
sword
for
a
second
in
the
air
there
was
a
flash
a
heavy
ugly
thud
a
crashing
fall
with
one
blow
the
head
had
been
severed
from
the
body
a
dead
silence
followed
broken
only
by
the
hideous
noise
of
the
blood
throbbing
out
of
the
inert
head
before
us
which
but
a
moment
before
had
been
a
brave
and
chivalrous
man
it
was
horrible
the
made
a
low
bow
wiped
his
sword
with
a
piece
of
paper
which
he
had
ready
for
the
purpose
and
retired
from
the
raised
floor
and
the
stained
dirk
was
solemnly
borne
away
a
bloody
proof
of
the
execution
the
two
representatives
of
the
mikado
then
left
their
places
and
crossing
over
to
where
the
foreign
witnesses
sat
called
to
us
to
witness
that
the
sentence
of
death
upon
taki
zenzaburo
had
been
faithfully
carried
out
the
ceremony
being
at
an
end
we
left
the
temple
i
might
multiply
any
number
of
descriptions
of
from
literature
or
from
the
relation
of
but
one
more
instance
will
suffice
two
brothers
sakon
and
naiki
respectively
and
seventeen
years
of
age
made
an
effort
to
kill
iyéyasu
in
order
to
avenge
their
father
wrongs
but
before
they
could
enter
the
camp
they
were
made
prisoners
the
old
general
admired
the
pluck
of
the
youths
who
dared
an
attempt
on
his
life
and
ordered
that
they
should
be
allowed
to
die
an
honorable
death
their
little
brother
hachimaro
a
mere
infant
of
eight
summers
was
condemned
to
a
similar
fate
as
the
sentence
was
pronounced
on
all
the
male
members
of
the
family
and
the
three
were
taken
to
a
monastery
where
it
was
to
be
executed
a
physician
who
was
present
on
the
occasion
has
left
us
a
diary
from
which
the
following
scene
is
translated
when
they
were
all
seated
in
a
row
for
final
despatch
sakon
turned
to
the
youngest
and
said
thou
first
for
i
wish
to
be
sure
that
thou
doest
it
aright
upon
the
little
one
replying
that
as
he
had
never
seen
performed
he
would
like
to
see
his
brothers
do
it
and
then
he
could
follow
them
the
older
brothers
smiled
between
their
tears
said
little
fellow
so
canst
thou
well
boast
of
being
our
father
child
when
they
had
placed
him
between
them
sakon
thrust
the
dagger
into
the
left
side
of
his
own
abdomen
and
asked
brother
dost
understand
now
only
do
push
the
dagger
too
far
lest
thou
fall
back
lean
forward
rather
and
keep
thy
knees
well
composed
naiki
did
likewise
and
said
to
the
boy
thy
eyes
open
or
else
thou
mayst
look
like
a
dying
woman

hot

youths
rushed
into

as

mixed
and
dubious
motives
drove
more
samurai
to
this
deed
than

life
was
cheap
cheap
as
reckoned
by
the
popular
standard
of
honor
the
saddest
feature
was
that
honor
which
was

was

alloyed

the

which
dante
consigns
all
victims
of
and
yet
for
a
true
samurai
to
hasten
death
or
to
court
it
was
alike
cowardice
a
typical
fighter
when
he
lost
battle
after
battle
and
was
pursued
from
plain
to
hill
and
from
bush
to
cavern
found
himself
hungry
and
alone
in
the
dark
hollow
of
a
tree
his
sword
blunt
with
use
his
bow
broken
and
arrows
exhausted
did
not
the
noblest
of
the
romans
fall
upon
his
own
sword
in
phillippi
under
like
circumstances
deemed
it
cowardly
to
die
but
with
a
fortitude
approaching
a
christian
martyr
cheered
himself
with
an
impromptu
verse
come
evermore
come
ye
dread
sorrows
and
pains
and
heap
on
my
burden
back
that
i
not
one
test
may
lack
of
what
strength
in
me
remains
this
then
was
the
bushido
teaching
bear
and
face
all
calamities
and
adversities
with
patience
and
a
pure
conscience
for
as
mencius
taught
when
heaven
is
about
to
confer
a
great
office
on
anyone
it
first
exercises
his
mind
with
suffering
and
his
sinews
and
bones
with
toil
it
exposes
his
body
to
hunger
and
subjects
him
to
extreme
poverty
and
it
confounds
his
undertakings
in
all
these
ways
it
stimulates
his
mind
hardens
his
nature
and
supplies
his
incompetencies
true
honor
lies
in
fulfilling
heaven
decree
and
no
death
incurred
in
so
doing
is
ignominious
whereas
death
to
avoid
what
heaven
has
in
store
is
cowardly
indeed
in
that
quaint
book
of
sir
thomas
browne
there
is
an
exact
english
equivalent
for
what
is
repeatedly
taught
in
our
precepts
let
me
quote
it
it
is
a
brave
act
of
valor
to
contemn
death
but
where
life
is
more
terrible
than
death
it
is
then
the
truest
valor
to
dare
to
live
a
renowned
priest
of
the
seventeenth
century
satirically
observed
talk
as
he
may
a
samurai
who
has
died
is
apt
in
decisive
moments
to
flee
or
hide
again
him
who
once
has
died
in
the
bottom
of
his
breast
no
spears
of
sanada
nor
all
the
arrows
of
tametomo
can
pierce
how
near
we
come
to
the
portals
of
the
temple
whose
builder
taught
he
that
loseth
his
life
for
my
sake
shall
find
it
these
are
but
a
few
of
the
numerous
examples
which
tend
to
confirm
the
moral
identity
of
the
human
species
notwithstanding
an
attempt
so
assiduously
made
to
render
the
distinction
between
christian
and
pagan
as
great
as
possible
footnote

we
have
thus
seen
that
the
bushido
institution
of
suicide
was
neither
so
irrational
nor
barbarous
as
its
abuse
strikes
us
at
first
sight
we
will
now
see
whether
its
sister
institution
of
redress
or
call
it
revenge
if
you
will
has
its
mitigating
features
i
hope
i
can
dispose
of
this
question
in
a
few
words
since
a
similar
institution
or
call
it
custom
if
that
suits
you
better
has
at
some
time
prevailed
among
all
peoples
and
has
not
yet
become
entirely
obsolete
as
attested
by
the
continuance
of
duelling
and
lynching
why
has
not
an
american
captain
recently
challenged
esterhazy
that
the
wrongs
of
dreyfus
be
avenged
among
a
savage
tribe
which
has
no
marriage
adultery
is
not
a
sin
and
only
the
jealousy
of
a
lover
protects
a
woman
from
abuse
so
in
a
time
which
has
no
criminal
court
murder
is
not
a
crime
and
only
the
vigilant
vengeance
of
the
victim
people
preserves
social
order
what
is
the
most
beautiful
thing
on
earth
said
osiris
to
horus
the
reply
was
to
avenge
a
parent
wrongs
to
which
a
japanese
would
have
added
and
a
master
in
revenge
there
is
something
which
satisfies
one
sense
of
justice
the
avenger
reasons
my
good
father
did
not
deserve
death
he
who
killed
him
did
great
evil
my
father
if
he
were
alive
would
not
tolerate
a
deed
like
this
heaven
itself
hates
it
is
the
will
of
my
father
it
is
the
will
of
heaven
that
the
cease
from
his
work
he
must
perish
by
my
hand
because
he
shed
my
blood
i
who
am
his
flesh
and
blood
must
shed
the
murderer
the
same
heaven
shall
not
shelter
him
and
me
the
ratiocination
is
simple
and
childish
though
we
know
hamlet
did
not
reason
much
more
deeply
nevertheless
it
shows
an
innate
sense
of
exact
balance
and
equal
justice
an
eye
for
an
eye
a
tooth
for
a

our
sense
of
revenge
is
as
exact
as
our
mathematical
faculty
and
until
both
terms
of
the
equation
are
satisfied
we
can
not
get
over
the
sense
of
something
left
undone
in
judaism
which
believed
in
a
jealous
god
or
in
greek
mythology
which
provided
a
nemesis
vengeance
may
be
left
to
superhuman
agencies
but
common
sense
furnished
bushido
with
the
institution
of
redress
as
a
kind
of
ethical
court
of
equity
where
people
could
take
cases
not
to
be
judged
in
accordance
with
ordinary
law
the
master
of
the
ronins
was
condemned
to
death
he
had
no
court
of
higher
instance
to
appeal
to
his
faithful
retainers
addressed
themselves
to
vengeance
the
only
supreme
court
existing
they
in
their
turn
were
condemned
by
common
law
but
the
popular
instinct
passed
a
different
judgment
and
hence
their
memory
is
still
kept
as
green
and
fragrant
as
are
their
graves
at
sengakuji
to
this
day
though
taught
to
recompense
injury
with
kindness
the
voice
of
confucius
was
very
much
louder
which
counselled
that
injury
must
be
recompensed
with
justice
and
yet
revenge
was
justified
only
when
it
was
undertaken
in
behalf
of
our
superiors
and
benefactors
one
own
wrongs
including
injuries
done
to
wife
and
children
were
to
be
borne
and
forgiven
a
samurai
could
therefore
fully
sympathize
with
oath
to
avenge
his
country
wrongs
but
he
scorns
james
hamilton
for
wearing
in
his
girdle
a
handful
of
earth
from
his
wife

as
an
eternal
incentive
to
avenge
her
wrongs
on

both

to
an

by
very
painful
means
or
at
the
cost

agony
in

out
of

may
be
assigned
as

the
two

and

irrational

is
the
best

former

and
from
these
bloody
institutions
as
well
as
from
the
general
tenor
of
bushido
it
is
easy
to
infer
that
the
sword
played
an
important
part
in
social
discipline
and
life
the
saying
passed
as
an
axiom
which
called
the
sword
the
soul
of
the
samurai
and
made
it
the
emblem
of
power
and
prowess
when
mahomet
proclaimed
that
the
sword
is
the
key
of
heaven
and
of
hell
he
only
echoed
a
japanese
sentiment
very
early
the
samurai
boy
learned
to
wield
it
it
was
a
momentous
occasion
for
him
when
at
the
age
of
five
he
was
apparelled
in
the
paraphernalia
of
samurai
costume
placed
upon
a

initiated
into
the
rights
of
the
military
profession
by
having
thrust
into
his
girdle
a
real
sword
instead
of
the
toy
dirk
with
which
he
had
been
playing
after
this
first
ceremony
of
per
he
was
no
more
to
be
seen
outside
his
father
gates
without
this
badge
of
his
status
even
if
it
was
usually
substituted
for
wear
by
a
gilded
wooden
dirk
not
many
years
pass
before
he
wears
constantly
the
genuine
steel
though
blunt
and
then
the
sham
arms
are
thrown
aside
and
with
enjoyment
keener
than
his
newly
acquired
blades
he
marches
out
to
try
their
edge
on

when
be

estate
at
the
age
of
fifteen
being
given
independence
of
action
he
can
now
pride
himself
upon
the
possession
of
arms
sharp
enough
for
any
work
the
very
possession
of
the
dangerous
instrument
imparts
to
him
a
feeling
and
an
air
of
and
responsibility
he
beareth
not
his
sword
in

what
he
carries
in

the

an

and

a
sanctuary
daily
he

as

remained
a

it
presented
no

forth
from

the
abuse
sometimes
went
so
far
as
to
try
the
acquired
steel
on
some
harmless
neck
the
question
that
concerns
us
most
is
however
did
bushido
justify
the
promiscuous
use
of
the
weapon
the
answer
is
unequivocally
no
as
it
laid
great
stress
on
its
proper
use
so
did
it
denounce
and
abhor
its
misuse
a
dastard
or
a
braggart
was
he
who
brandished
his
weapon
on
undeserved
occasions
a
man
knows
the
right
time
to
use
it
and
such
times
come
but
rarely
let
us
listen
to
the
late
count
katsu
who
passed
through
one
of
the
most
turbulent
times
of
our
history
when
assassinations
suicides
and
other
sanguinary
practices
were
the
order
of
the
day
endowed
as
he
once
was
with
almost
dictatorial
powers
repeatedly
marked
out
as
an
object
for
assassination
he
never
tarnished
his
sword
with
blood
in
relating
some
of
his
reminiscences
to
a
friend
he
says
in
a
quaint
plebeian
way
peculiar
to
him
i
have
a
great
dislike
for
killing
people
and
so
i
have
killed
one
single
man
i
have
released
those
whose
heads
should
have
been
chopped
off
a
friend
said
to
me
one
day
do
kill
enough
do
you
eat
pepper
and
well
some
people
are
no
better
but
you
see
that
fellow
was
slain
himself
my
escape
may
be
due
to
my
dislike
of
killing
i
had
the
hilt
of
my
sword
so
tightly
fastened
to
the
scabbard
that
it
was
hard
to
draw
the
blade
i
made
up
my
mind
that
though
they
cut
me
i
will
not
cut
yes
yes
some
people
are
truly
like
fleas
and
mosquitoes
and
they
bite
but
what
does
their
biting
amount
to
it
itches
a
little
that
all
it
wo
endanger
life
these
are
the
words
of
one
whose
bushido
training
was
tried
in
the
fiery
furnace
of
adversity
and
triumph
the
popular
apothegm
to
be
beaten
is
to
conquer
meaning
true
conquest
consists
in
not
opposing
a
riotous
foe
and
the
best
won
victory
is
that
obtained
without
shedding
of
blood
and
others
of
similar
import
will
show
that
after
all
the
ultimate
ideal
of
knighthood
was
peace
it
was
a
great
pity
that
this
high
ideal
was
left
exclusively
to
priests
and
moralists
to
preach
while
the
samurai
went
on
practicing
and
extolling
martial
traits
in
this
they
went
so
far
as
to
tinge
the
ideals
of
womanhood
with
amazonian
character
here
we
may
profitably
devote
a
few
paragraphs
to
the
subject
of
the
training
and
position
of
woman
the
female
half
of
our
species
has
sometimes
been
called
the
paragon
of
paradoxes
because
the
intuitive
working
of
its
mind
is
beyond
the
comprehension
of
men
arithmetical
understanding
the
chinese
ideogram
denoting
the
mysterious
the
unknowable
consists
of
two
parts
one
meaning
young
and
the
other
woman
because
the
physical
charms
and
delicate
thoughts
of
the
fair
sex
are
above
the
coarse
mental
calibre
of
our
sex
to
explain
in
the
bushido
ideal
of
woman
however
there
is
little
mystery
and
only
a
seeming
paradox
i
have
said
that
it
was
amazonian
but
that
is
only
half
the
truth
ideographically
the
chinese
represent
wife
by
a
woman
holding
a
broom
certainly
not
to
brandish
it
offensively
or
defensively
against
her
conjugal
ally
neither
for
witchcraft
but
for
the
more
harmless
uses
for
which
the
besom
was
first
invented
the
idea
involved
being
thus
not
less
homely
than
the
etymological
derivation
of
the
english
wife
weaver
and
daughter
milkmaid
without
confining
the
sphere
of
woman
activity
to
kirche
as
the
present
german
kaiser
is
said
to
do
the
bushido
ideal
of
womanhood
was
preeminently
domestic
these
seeming
contradictions
domesticity
and
amazonian
traits
are
not
inconsistent
with
the
precepts
of
knighthood
as
we
shall
see
bushido
being
a
teaching
primarily
intended
for
the
masculine
sex
the
virtues
it
prized
in
woman
were
naturally
far
from
being
distinctly
feminine
winckelmann
remarks
that
the
supreme
beauty
of
greek
art
is
rather
male
than
female
and
lecky
adds
that
it
was
true
in
the
moral
conception
of
the
greeks
as
in
their
art
bushido
similarly
praised
those
women
most
who
emancipated
themselves
from
the
frailty
of
their
sex
and
displayed
an
heroic
fortitude
worthy
of
the
strongest
and
the
bravest
of
men
young
girls
therefore
were
trained
to
repress
their
feelings
to
indurate
their
nerves
to
manipulate
weapons
especially
the
sword
called
so
as
to
be
able
to
hold
their
own
against
unexpected
odds
yet
the
primary
motive
for
exercises
of
this
martial
character
was
not
for
use
in
the
field
it
was
twofold
personal
and
domestic
woman
owning
no

her
own

with
her

she
guarded
her
personal
sanctity
with
as
much
zeal
as
her

did
his

the
domestic
utility
of
her
warlike
training
was

of

it
would
be
unfair
to
give
my
readers
an
idea
that
masculinity
alone
was
our
highest
ideal
for
woman
far
from
it
accomplishments
and
the
gentler
graces
of
life
were
required
of
them
music
dancing
and
literature
were
not
neglected
some
of
the
finest
verses
in
our
literature
were
expressions
of
feminine
sentiments
in
fact
women
played
an
important
role
in
the
history
of
japanese
dancing
was
taught
i
am
speaking
of
samurai
girls
and
not
of
only
to
smooth
the
angularity
of
their
movements
music
was
to
regale
the
weary
hours
of
their
fathers
and
husbands
hence
it
was
not
for
the
technique
the
art
as
such
that
music
was
learned
for
the
ultimate
object
was
purification
of
heart
since
it
was
said
that
no
harmony
of
sound
is
attainable
without
the
player
heart
being
in
harmony
with
herself
here
again
we
see
the
same
idea
prevailing
which
we
notice
in
the
training
of
youths
that
accomplishments
were
ever
kept
subservient
to
moral
worth
just
enough
of
music
and
dancing
to
add
grace
and
brightness
to
life
but
never
to
foster
vanity
and
extravagance
i
sympathize
with
the
persian
prince
who
when
taken
into
a
in
london
and
asked
to
take
part
in
the
merriment
bluntly
remarked
that
in
his
country
they
provided
a
particular
set
of
girls
to
do
that
kind
of
business
for
them
the
accomplishments
of
our
women
were
not
acquired
for
show
or
social
ascendency
they
were
a
home
diversion
and
if
they
shone
in
social
parties
it
was
as
the
attributes
of
a
hostess
in
other
words
as
a
part
of
the
household
contrivance
for
hospitality
domesticity
guided
their
education
it
may
be
said
that
the
accomplishments
of
the
women
of
old
japan
be
they
martial
or
pacific
in
character
were
mainly
intended
for
the
home
and
however
far
they
might
roam
they
never
lost
sight
of
the
hearth
as
the
center
it
was
to
maintain
its
honor
and
integrity
that
they
slaved
drudged
and
gave
up
their
lives
night
and
day
in
tones
at
once
firm
and
tender
brave
and
plaintive
they
sang
to
their
little
nests
as
daughter
woman
sacrificed
herself
for
her
father
as
wife
for
her
husband
and
as
mother
for
her
son
thus
from
earliest
youth
she
was
taught
to
deny
herself
her
life
was
not
one
of
independence
but
of
dependent
service
man
helpmeet
if
her
presence
is
helpful
she
stays
on
the
stage
with
him
if
it
hinders
his
work
she
retires
behind
the
curtain
not
infrequently
does
it
happen
that
a
youth
becomes
enamored
of
a
maiden
who
returns
his
love
with
equal
ardor
but
when
she
realizes
his
interest
in
her
makes
him
forgetful
of
his
duties
disfigures
her
person
that
her
attractions
may
cease
adzuma
the
ideal
wife
in
the
minds
of
samurai
girls
finds
herself
loved
by
a
man
who
in
order
to
win
her
affection
conspires
against
her
husband
upon
pretence
of
joining
in
the
guilty
plot
she
manages
in
the
dark
to
take
her
husband
place
and
the
sword
of
the
lover
assassin
descends
upon
her
own
devoted
head
the
following
epistle
written
by
the
wife
of
a
young
daimio
before
taking
her
own
life
needs
no
comment
oft
have
i
heard
that
no
accident
or
chance
ever
mars
the
march
of
events
here
below
and
that
all
moves
in
accordance
with
a
plan
to
take
shelter
under
a
common
bough
or
a
drink
of
the
same
river
is
alike
ordained
from
ages
prior
to
our
birth
since
we
were
joined
in
ties
of
eternal
wedlock
now
two
short
years
ago
my
heart
hath
followed
thee
even
as
its
shadow
followeth
an
object
inseparably
bound
heart
to
heart
loving
and
being
loved
learning
but
recently
however
that
the
coming
battle
is
to
be
the
last
of
thy
labor
and
life
take
the
farewell
greeting
of
thy
loving
partner
i
have
heard
that
the
mighty
warrior
of
ancient
china
lost
a
battle
loth
to
part
with
his
favorite
gu
yoshinaka
too
brave
as
he
was
brought
disaster
to
his
cause
too
weak
to
bid
prompt
farewell
to
his
wife
why
should
i
to
whom
earth
no
longer
offers
hope
or
joy
why
should
i
detain
thee
or
thy
thoughts
by
living
why
should
i
not
rather
await
thee
on
the
road
which
all
mortal
kind
must
sometime
tread
never
prithee
never
forget
the
many
benefits
which
our
good
master
hideyori
hath
heaped
upon
thee
the
gratitude
we
owe
him
is
as
deep
as
the
sea
and
as
high
as
the
hills
woman
surrender
of
herself
to
the
good
of
her
husband
home
and
family
was
as
willing
and
honorable
as
the
man
to
the
good
of
his
lord
and
country
without
which
no
can
be
solved
was
the
keynote
of
the
loyalty
of
man
as
well
as
of
the
domesticity
of
woman
she
was
no
more
the
slave
of
man
than
was
her
husband
of
his
and
the
part
she
played
was
recognized
as
the
inner
help
in
the
ascending
scale
of
service
stood
woman
who
annihilated
herself
for
man
that
he
might
annihilate
himself
for
the
master
that
he
in
turn
might
obey
heaven
i
know
the
weakness
of
this
teaching
and
that
the
superiority
of
christianity
is
nowhere
more
manifest
than
here
in
that
it
requires
of
each
and
every
living
soul
direct
responsibility
to
its
creator
nevertheless
as
far
as
the
doctrine
of
service
the
serving
of
a
cause
higher
than
one
own
self
even
at
the
sacrifice
of
individuality
i
say
the
doctrine
of
service
which
is
the
greatest
that
christ
preached
and
is
the
sacred
keynote
of
his
mission
as
far
as
that
is
concerned
bushido
is
based
on
eternal
truth
my
readers
will
not
accuse
me
of
undue
prejudice
in
favor
of
slavish
surrender
of
volition
i
accept
in
a
large
measure
the
view
advanced
with
breadth
of
learning
and
defended
with
profundity
of
thought
by
hegel
that
history
is
the
unfolding
and
realization
of
freedom
the
point
i
wish
to
make
is
that
the
whole
teaching
of
bushido
was
so
thoroughly
imbued
with
the
spirit
of
that
it
was
required
not
only
of
woman
but
of
man
hence
until
the
influence
of
its
precepts
is
entirely
done
away
with
our
society
will
not
realize
the
view
rashly
expressed
by
an
american
exponent
of
woman
rights
who
exclaimed
may
all
the
daughters
of
japan
rise
in
revolt
against
ancient
customs
can
such
a
revolt
succeed
will
it
improve
the
female
status
will
the
rights
they
gain
by
such
a
summary
process
repay
the
loss
of
that
sweetness
of
disposition
that
gentleness
of
manner
which
are
their
present
heritage
was
not
the
loss
of
domesticity
on
the
part
of
roman
matrons
followed
by
moral
corruption
too
gross
to
mention
can
the
american
reformer
assure
us
that
a
revolt
of
our
daughters
is
the
true
course
for
their
historical
development
to
take
these
are
grave
questions
changes
must
and
will
come
without
revolts
in
the
meantime
let
us
see
whether
the
status
of
the
fair
sex
under
the
bushido
regimen
was
really
so
bad
as
to
justify
a
revolt
we
hear
much
of
the
outward
respect
european
knights
paid
to
god
and
the
ladies
the
incongruity
of
the
two
terms
making
gibbon
blush
we
are
also
told
by
hallam
that
the
morality
of
chivalry
was
coarse
that
gallantry
implied
illicit
love
the
effect
of
chivalry
on
the
weaker
vessel
was
food
for
reflection
on
the
part
of
philosophers
guizot
contending
that
feudalism
and
chivalry
wrought
wholesome
influences
while
spencer
tells
us
that
in
a
militant
society
and
what
is
feudal
society
if
not
militant
the
position
of
woman
is
necessarily
low
improving
only
as
society
becomes
more
industrial
now
is
guizot
theory
true
of
japan
or
is
spencer
in
reply
i
might
aver
that
both
are
right
the
military
class
in
japan
was
restricted
to
the
samurai
comprising
nearly
souls
above
them
were
the
military
nobles
the
and
the
court
nobles
the
these
higher
sybaritical
nobles
being
fighters
only
in
name
below
them
were
masses
of
the
common
people
mechanics
tradesmen
and
peasants
whose
life
was
devoted
to
arts
of
peace
thus
what
herbert
spencer
gives
as
the
characteristics
of
a
militant
type
of
society
may
be
said
to
have
been
exclusively
confined
to
the
samurai
class
while
those
of
the
industrial
type
were
applicable
to
the
classes
above
and
below
it
this
is
well
illustrated
by
the
position
of
woman
for
in
no
class
did
she
experience
less
freedom
than
among
the
samurai
strange
to
say
the
lower
the
social
class
as
for
instance
among
small
artisans
the
more
equal
was
the
position
of
husband
and
wife
among
the
higher
nobility
too
the
difference
in
the
relations
of
the
sexes
was
less
marked
chiefly
because
there
were
few
occasions
to
bring
the
differences
of
sex
into
prominence
the
leisurely
nobleman
having
become
literally
effeminate
thus
spencer
dictum
was
fully
exemplified
in
old
japan
as
to
guizot
those
who
read
his
presentation
of
a
feudal
community
will
remember
that
he
had
the
higher
nobility
especially
under
consideration
so
that
his
generalization
applies
to
the
and
the
i
shall
be
guilty
of
gross
injustice
to
historical
truth
if
my
words
give
one
a
very
low
opinion
of
the
status
of
woman
under
bushido
i
do
not
hesitate
to
state
that
she
was
not
treated
as
man
equal
but
until
we
learn
to
discriminate
between
difference
and
inequalities
there
will
always
be
misunderstandings
upon
this
subject
when
we
think
in
how
few
respects
men
are
equal
among
themselves
before
law
courts
or
voting
polls
it
seems
idle
to
trouble
ourselves
with
a
discussion
on
the
equality
of
sexes
when
the
american
declaration
of
independence
said
that
all
men
were
created
equal
it
had
no
reference
to
their
mental
or
physical
gifts
it
simply
repeated
what
ulpian
long
ago
announced
that
before
the
law
all
men
are
equal
legal
rights
were
in
this
case
the
measure
of
their
equality
were
the
law
the
only
scale
by
which
to
measure
the
position
of
woman
in
a
community
it
would
be
as
easy
to
tell
where
she
stands
as
to
give
her
avoirdupois
in
pounds
and
ounces
but
the
question
is
is
there
a
correct
standard
in
comparing
the
relative
social
position
of
the
sexes
is
it
right
is
it
enough
to
compare
woman
status
to
man
as
the
value
of
silver
is
compared
with
that
of
gold
and
give
the
ratio
numerically
such
a
method
of
calculation
excludes
from
consideration
the
most
important
kind
of
value
which
a
human
being
possesses
namely
the
intrinsic
in
view
of
the
manifold
variety
of
requisites
for
making
each
sex
fulfil
its
earthly
mission
the
standard
to
be
adopted
in
measuring
its
relative
position
must
be
of
a
composite
character
or
to
borrow
from
economic
language
it
must
be
a
multiple
standard
bushido
had
a
standard
of
its
own
and
it
was
binomial
it
tried
to
guage
the
value
of
woman
on
the
and
by
the
hearth
there
she
counted
for
very
little
here
for
all
the
treatment
accorded
her
corresponded
to
this
double
measurement
as
a
unit
not
much
while
as
wife
and
mother
she
received
highest
respect
and
deepest
affection
why
among
so
military
a
nation
as
the
romans
were
their
matrons
so
highly
venerated
was
it
not
because
they
were
mothers
not
as
fighters
or
but
as
their
mothers
did
men
bow
before
them
so
with
us
while
fathers
and
husbands
were
absent
in
field
or
camp
the
government
of
the
household
was
left
entirely
in
the
hands
of
mothers
and
wives
the
education
of
the
young
even
their
defence
was
entrusted
to
them
the
warlike
exercises
of
women
of
which
i
have
spoken
were
primarily
to
enable
them
intelligently
to
direct
and
follow
the
education
of
their
children
i
have
noticed
a
rather
superficial
notion
prevailing
among
foreigners
that
because
the
common
japanese
expression
for
one
wife
is
my
rustic
wife
and
the
like
she
is
despised
and
held
in
little
esteem
when
it
is
told
that
such
phrases
as
my
foolish
father
my
swinish
son
my
awkward
self
are
in
current
use
is
not
the
answer
clear
enough
to
me
it
seems
that
our
idea
of
marital
union
goes
in
some
ways
further
than
the
christian
man
and
woman
shall
be
one
flesh
the
individualism
of
the
can
not
let
go
of
the
idea
that
husband
and
wife
are
two
persons
hence
when
they
disagree
their
separate
are
recognized
and
when
they
agree
they
exhaust
their
vocabulary
in
all
sorts
of
silly
and
nonsensical
blandishments
it
sounds
highly
irrational
to
our
ears
when
a
husband
or
wife
speaks
to
a
third
party
of
his
other
half
better
or
worse
as
being
lovely
bright
kind
and
what
not
is
it
good
taste
to
speak
of
one
self
as
my
bright
self
my
lovely
disposition
and
so
forth
we
think
praising
one
own
wife
or
one
own
husband
is
praising
a
part
of
one
own
self
and
is
regarded
to
say
the
least
as
bad
taste
among
us
and
i
hope
among
christian
nations
too
i
have
diverged
at
some
length
because
the
polite
debasement
of
one
consort
was
a
usage
most
in
vogue
among
the
samurai
the
teutonic
races
beginning
their
tribal
life
with
a
superstitious
awe
of
the
fair
sex
though
this
is
really
wearing
off
in
germany
and
the
americans
beginning
their
social
life
under
the
painful
consciousness
of
the
numerical
insufficiency
of
women
who
now
increasing
are
i
am
afraid
fast
losing
the
prestige
their
colonial
mothers
enjoyed
the
respect
man
pays
to
woman
has
in
western
civilization
become
the
chief
standard
of
morality
but
in
the
martial
ethics
of
bushido
the
main
dividing
the
good
and
the
bad
was
sought
elsewhere
it
was
located
along
the
line
of
duty
which
bound
man
to
his
own
divine
soul
and
then
to
other
souls
in
the
five
relations
i
have
mentioned
in
the
early
part
of
this
paper
of
these
we
have
brought
to
our
notice
loyalty
the
relation
between
one
man
as
vassal
and
another
as
lord
upon
the
rest
i
have
only
dwelt
incidentally
as
occasion
presented
itself
because
they
were
not
peculiar
to
bushido
being
founded
on
natural
affections
they
could
but
be
common
to
all
mankind
though
in
some
particulars
they
may
have
been
accentuated
by
conditions
which
its
teachings
induced
in
this
connection
there
comes
before
me
the
peculiar
strength
and
tenderness
of
friendship
between
man
and
man
which
often
added
to
the
bond
of
brotherhood
a
romantic
attachment
doubtless
intensified
by
the
separation
of
the
sexes
in
youth
a
separation
which
denied
to
affection
the
natural
channel
open
to
it
in
western
chivalry
or
in
the
free
intercourse
of
lands
i
might
fill
pages
with
japanese
versions
of
the
story
of
damon
and
pythias
or
achilles
and
patroclos
or
tell
in
bushido
parlance
of
ties
as
sympathetic
as
those
which
bound
david
and
jonathan
footnote
i
refer
to
those
days
when
girls
were
imported
from
england
and
given
in
marriage
for
so
many
pounds
of
tobacco
etc
it
is
not
surprising
however
that
the
virtues
and
teachings
unique
in
the
precepts
of
knighthood
did
not
remain
circumscribed
to
the
military
class
this
makes
us
hasten
to
the
consideration
of
the
influence
of
bushido
on
the
nation
at
large
we
have
brought
into
view
only
a
few
of
the
more
prominent
peaks
which
rise
above
the
range
of
knightly
virtues
in
themselves
so
much
more
elevated
than
the
general
level
of
our
national
life
as
the
sun
in
its
rising
first
tips
the
highest
peaks
with
russet
hue
and
then
gradually
casts
its
rays
on
the
valley
below
so
the
ethical
system
which
first
enlightened
the
military
order
drew
in
course
of
time
followers
from
amongst
the
masses
democracy
raises
up
a
natural
prince
for
its
leader
and
aristocracy
infuses
a
princely
spirit
among
the
people
virtues
are
no
less
contagious
than
vices
there
needs
but
one
wise
man
in
a
company
and
all
are
wise
so
rapid
is
the
contagion
says
emerson
no
social
class
or
caste
can
resist
the
diffusive
power
of
moral
influence
prate
as
we
may
of
the
triumphant
march
of
liberty
rarely
has
it
received
impetus
from
the
masses
was
it
not
rather
the
work
of
the
squires
and
very
truly
does
taine
say
these
three
syllables
as
used
across
the
channel
summarize
the
history
of
english
society
democracy
may
make
retorts
to
such
a
statement
and
fling
back
the
question
when
adam
delved
and
eve
span
where
then
was
the
gentleman
all
the
more
pity
that
a
gentleman
was
not
present
in
eden
the
first
parents
missed
him
sorely
and
paid
a
high
price
for
his
absence
had
he
been
there
not
only
would
the
garden
have
been
more
tastefully
dressed
but
they
would
have
learned
without
painful
experience
that
disobedience
to
jehovah
was
disloyalty
and
dishonor
treason
and
rebellion
what
japan
was
she
owed
to
the
samurai
they
were
not
only
the
flower
of
the
nation
but
its
root
as
well
all
the
gracious
gifts
of
heaven
flowed
through
them
though
they
kept
themselves
socially
aloof
from
the
populace
they
set
a
moral
standard
for
them
and
guided
them
by
their
example
i
admit
bushido
had
its
esoteric
and
exoteric
teachings
these
were
eudemonistic
looking
after
the
welfare
and
happiness
of
the
commonalty
while
those
were
aretaic
emphasizing
the
practice
of
virtues
for
their
own
sake
in
the
most
chivalrous
days
of
europe
knights
formed
numerically
but
a
small
fraction
of
the
population
but
as

instruction
the
theatres

booths
the
preacher
dais

musical

novels
have
taken
for
their
chief
theme
the
stories
of
the
samurai
the
peasants
round
the
open
fire
in
their
huts
never
tire
of
repeating
the
achievements
of
yoshitsuné

his
faithful

the
dusky
urchins

the
last
stick
burns
out
and
the
fire
dies
in
its
embers
still
leaving
their
hearts
aglow
with
the
tale
that
is
told
the
clerks
and
the
after
their
day
work
is
over
and
the
of
the
store
are
closed
gather
together
to
relate
the
story
of
nobunaga
and
hidéyoshi
far
into
the
night

slumber
overtakes
their
weary
eyes
and
transports
them
from
the
drudgery
of
the
counter
to
the
exploits

so
imbued
with
the
love
of
knightly
deeds
and
virtues
that
like
desdemona
they
would
seriously
incline
to
devour
with
greedy
ear
the
romance
of
the
samurai
footnote
outside

the
samurai
grew
to
be
the
of
the
whole
race
as
among
flowers
the
cherry
is
queen
so
among
men
the
samurai
is
lord
so
sang
the
populace
debarred
from
commercial
pursuits
the
military
class
itself
did
not
aid
commerce
but
there
was
no
channel
of
human
activity
no
avenue
of
thought
which
did
not
receive
in
some
measure
an
impetus
from
bushido
intellectual
and
moral
japan
was
directly
or
indirectly
the
work
of
knighthood
mallock
in
his
exceedingly
suggestive
book
aristocracy
and
evolution
has
eloquently
told
us
that
social
evolution
in
so
far
as
it
is
other
than
biological
may
be
defined
as
the
unintended
result
of
the
intentions
of
great
men
further
that
historical
progress
is
produced
by
a
struggle
not
among
the
community
generally
to
live
but
a
struggle
amongst
a
small
section
of
the
community
to
lead
to
direct
to
employ
the
majority
in
the
best
way
whatever
may
be
said
about
the
soundness
of
his
argument
these
statements
are
amply
verified
in
the
part
played
by
bushi
in
the
social
progress
as
far
as
it
went
of
our
empire
how
the
spirit
of
bushido
permeated
all
social
classes
is
also
shown
in
the
development
of
a
certain
order
of
men
known
as
the
natural
leaders
of
democracy
staunch
fellows
were
they
every
inch
of
them
strong
with
the
strength
of
massive
manhood
at
once
the
spokesmen
and
the
guardians
of
popular
rights
they
had
each
a
following
of
hundreds
and
thousands
of
souls
who
proffered
in
the
same
fashion
that
samurai
did
to
daimio
the
willing
service
of
limb
and
life
of
body
chattels
and
earthly
honor
backed
by
a
vast
multitude
of
rash
and
impetuous
those
born
bosses
formed
a
formidable
check
to
the
rampancy
of
the
order
in
manifold
ways
has
bushido
filtered
down
from
the
social
class
where
it
originated
and
acted
as
leaven
among
the
masses
furnishing
a
moral
standard
for
the
whole
people
the
precepts
of
knighthood
begun
at
first
as
the
glory
of
the
elite
became
in
time
an
aspiration
and
inspiration
to
the
nation
at
large
and
though
the
populace
could
not
attain
the
moral
height
of
those
loftier
souls
yet
the
soul
of
japan
ultimately
came
to
express

lindley
the
yamato
spirit
is
not
a
tame
tender
plant
but
a
wild
in
the
sense
of
natural
growth
it
is
indigenous
to
the
soil
its
accidental
qualities
it
may
share
with
the
flowers
of
other
lands
but
in
its
essence
it
remains
the
original
spontaneous
outgrowth
of
our
clime
but
its
nativity
is
not
its
sole
claim
to
our
affection
the
refinement
and
grace
of
its
beauty
appeal
to
aesthetic
sense
as
no
other
flower
can
we
can
not
share
the
admiration
of
the
europeans
for
their
roses
which
lack
the
simplicity
of
our
flower
then
too
the
thorns
that
are
hidden
beneath
the
sweetness
of
the
rose
the
tenacity
with
which
she
clings
to
life
as
though
loth
or
afraid
to
die
rather
than
drop
untimely
preferring
to
rot
on
her
stem
her
showy
colors
and
heavy
odors
all
these
are
traits
so
unlike
our
flower
which
carries
no
dagger
or
poison
under
its
beauty
which
is
ever
ready
to
depart
life
at
the
call
of
nature
whose
colors
are
never
gorgeous
and
whose
light
fragrance
never
palls
beauty
of
color
and
of
form
is
limited
in
its
showing
it
is
a
fixed
quality
of
existence

fragrance
is
volatile
ethereal
as
the

so
in
all

it
any
wonder
that
the

call
forth
the

asperities
these
are

would

worth
pondering
over

there
were
qualities

defects
of
character
which
the
exclusive

been

long
before

they
were
exploded
long
ago
by
theodor
waitz

hugh
murray
in
studying
the
various
virtues

by
bushido
we
have
drawn
upon
european

we
have
seen
that
no

character

it

true
the

it

the
character

bushido
stamped
on
our

on
the

in
particular
can
not

to
form
an
irreducible
element
of
species
but
nevertheless
as
to
the
vitality
which
it
retains
there
is
no

were
bushido
a

physical

the
momentum
it
has
gained
in
the
last
seven
hundred
years
could
not

so
abruptly

its
influence

as
cheysson

calculated
that

honest
confession

notions
requires
some
modification
for
bushido
the
maker
and
product
of
old
japan
is
still
the
guiding
principle
of
the
transition
and
will
prove
the
formative
force
of
the
new

the
great
statesmen
who
steered
the
ship
of
our
state
through
the
hurricane
of
the
restoration
and
the
whirlpool
of
national
rejuvenation
were
men
who
knew
no
other
moral
teaching
than
the
precepts
of
knighthood
some
writers
have
lately
tried
to
prove
that
the
christian
missionaries
contributed
an
appreciable
quota
to
the
making
of
new
japan
i
would
fain
render
honor
to
whom
honor
is
due
but
this
honor
can
hardly
be
accorded
to
the
good
missionaries
more
fitting
it
will
be
to
their
profession
to
stick
to
the
scriptural
injunction
of
preferring
one
another
in
honor
than
to
advance
a
claim
in
which
they
have
no
proofs
to
back
them
for
myself
i
believe
that
christian
missionaries
are
doing
great
things
for
japan
in
the
domain
of
education
and
especially
of
moral
education
only
the
mysterious
though
not
the
less
certain
working
of
the
spirit
is
still
hidden
in
divine
secrecy
whatever
they
do
is
still
of
indirect
effect
no
as
yet
christian
missions
have
effected
but
little

moulding
the

that
only
the

the
change

on

hand
it
is
fair
to
recognize
that
for
the
very
faults
and
defects
of
our
character
bushido
is
largely
responsible
our
lack
of
abstruse
philosophy
while
some
of
our
young
men
have
already
gained
international
reputation
in
scientific
researches
not
one
has
achieved
anything
in
philosophical
lines
is
traceable
to
the
neglect
of
metaphysical
training
under
bushido
regimen
of
education
our
sense
of
honor
is
responsible
for
our
exaggerated
sensitiveness
and
touchiness
and
if
there
is
the
conceit
in
us
with
which
some
foreigners
charge
us
that
too
is
a
pathological
outcome
of
honor
have
you
seen
in

a

shabbiest
garb
carrying
in
his
hand
a
large
cane
or
a
book
stalking
about
the
streets
with
an
air
of
utter
indifference
to
mundane
things
he
is
the
student
to
whom
the
earth
is
too
small
and
the
heavens
are
not
high
enough
he
has
his
own
theories
of
the
universe

he
dwells
in
castles
of

feeds
on
ethereal
words

the
fire
of
ambition
his
mind

athirst
for

penury
is
only
a

drive
him
onward
worldly
goods
are
in
his
sight
shackles
to
his
character
he
is
the
repository
of
loyalty
and
patriotism
he
is
the
guardian
of
national
honor
with
all
his
virtues
and
his
faults
he
is
the
last
fragment
of
bushido
and
powerful
as
is
still
the
effect
of
bushido
i
have
said
that
it
is
an
unconscious
and
mute
influence
the
heart
of
the
people
responds
without
knowing
the
reason
why
to
any
appeal
made
to
what
it
has
inherited
and
hence
the
same
moral
idea
expressed
in
a
newly
translated
term
and
in
an
old
bushido
term
has
a
vastly
different
degree
of
efficacy
a
backsliding
christian
whom
no
pastoral
persuasion
could
help
from
downward
tendency

reverted
from
his
course
by
an
appeal
made

his

the
fidelity

once
swore
to

loyalty
revived
all
the
noble

that
were

moral
renovation

one
cause
of
the
failure
of
mission
work
is
that
most
of
the

are
grossly
ignorant

what
do
we
care
for
heathen

some
say
and
consequently
estrange
their

from
the
habits
of

our

have
been
accustomed
to
for
centuries
past
mocking
a

as
though
the
career
of

the

the

ignoring
the
past
career
of
a
people
missionaries
claim
that
christianity
is
a
new
religion
whereas
to
my
mind
it
is
an
old
old
story
which
if
presented
in
intelligible
words
that
is
to
say
if
expressed
in
the
vocabulary
familiar
in
the
moral
development
of
a
people
will
find
easy
lodgment
in
their
hearts

christianity

its
american
or
english
form
with
more
of
freaks
and
fancies
than
grace
and
purity
of
its
founder
is
a
poor
scion
to
graft
on
bushido
stock

the
propagator

the
new

uproot
the
entire
stock
root
and
branches
and
plant
the
seeds
of
the
gospel
on
the
ravaged

such
a
heroic
process
may
be
possible
in
hawaii
where
it
is
alleged
the
church
militant
had
complete
success
in
amassing
spoils
of
wealth
itself
and
in
annihilating
the
aboriginal
race
such
a
process
is
most
decidedly
impossible
in
japan
nay
it
is
a
process
which
jesus
himself
would
never
have
employed
in
founding
his
kingdom
on

behooves
us
to
take
more
to
heart
the
following
words

divided
the

much
good
may
have
been
hidden
in
the
one
or
how
much
evil
may
have
been

part
of
themselves
with
the
worst

their
neighbors
the
ideal
of
christianity
with
the
corruption
of
greece
or
the
east
they
have
not
aimed
at
impartiality

have
been
contented
to
accumulate
all
that

said
in

but
whatever
may
be
the
error
committed
by
individuals
there
is
little
doubt
that
the
fundamental
principle
of
the
religion
they
profess
is
a
power
which
we
must
take
into
account
in
reckoning
the
future

days
seem

be
already

ominous
signs
are
in
the

that
betoken
its

it
few
historical
comparisons
can
be
more
judiciously
made
than
between
the
chivalry
of
europe
and
the
bushido
of
japan

if
history
repeats
itself
it
certainly
will
do
with
the
fate
of
the

the
larger
and
more
general
causes
that
helped
to
undermine
knighthood
and
chivalry
in
and
after
the
middle
ages
are
as
surely
working
for
the
decline
of
bushido
one
remarkable
difference
between
the
experience
of
europe
and
of
japan
is
that
whereas
in
europe
when
chivalry
was
weaned
from
feudalism
and
was
adopted
by
the
church
it
obtained
a
fresh
lease
of
life
in
japan
no
religion
was
large
enough
to
nourish
it
hence
when
the
mother
institution
feudalism
was
gone
bushido
left
an
orphan
had
to
shift
for
itself
the
present
elaborate
military
organization
might
take
it
under
its
patronage
but
we
know
that
modern
warfare
can
afford
little
room
for
its
continuous
growth
shintoism
which
fostered
it
in
its
infancy
is
itself
superannuated
the
hoary
sages
of
ancient
china
are
being
supplanted
by
the
intellectual
parvenu
of
the
type
of
bentham

mill
moral
theories
of

kind

to
the
chauvinistic
tendencies
of
the

therefore

to
the
need
of
this
day
have
been
invented
and
propounded
but
as
yet
we
hear
only
their
shrill
voices
echoing
through
the
columns
of
yellow
journalism
principalities
and
powers
are
arrayed
against
the
precepts
of
knighthood
already
as
veblen
says
the
decay
of
the
ceremonial
code
or
as
it
is
otherwise
called
the
vulgarization
of
life
among
the
industrial
classes
proper
has
become
one
of
the
chief
enormities
of
civilization
in
the
eyes
of
all
persons
of
delicate
sensibilities
the
irresistible
tide
of
triumphant
democracy
which
can
tolerate
no
form
or
shape
of
trust
and
bushido
was
a
trust
organized
by
those
who
monopolized
reserve
capital
of
intellect
and
culture
fixing
the
grades
and
value
of
moral
qualities
is
alone
powerful
enough
to
engulf
the
remnant
of
bushido
the
present
societary
forces
are
antagonistic
to
petty
class
spirit
and
chivalry
is
as
freeman
severely
criticizes
a
class
spirit
modern
society
if
it
pretends
to
any
unity
can
not
admit
purely
personal
obligations
devised
in
the
interests
of
an
exclusive
class
add
to
this
the
progress
of
popular
instruction
of
industrial
arts
and
habits
of
wealth
and
then
we
can
easily
see
that
neither
the
keenest
cuts

it
has
been
said
that
japan
won
her
late
war
with
china
by
means
of
murata
guns
and
krupp
cannon
it
has
been
said
the
victory
was
the
work
of
a
modern
school
system
but
these
are
less
than
does
ever
a
piano
be
it
of
the
choicest
workmanship
of
ehrbar
or
steinway
burst
forth
into
the
rhapsodies
of
liszt
or
the
sonatas
of
beethoven
without
a
master
hand
or
if
guns
win
battles
why
did
not
louis
napoleon
beat
the
prussians
with
his
or
the
spaniards
with
their
mausers
the
filipinos
whose
arms
were
no
better
than
the
remingtons
needless
to
repeat
what
has
grown
a
trite
saying
that
it
is
the
spirit
that
quickeneth
without
which
the
best
of
implements
profiteth
but
little
the
most
improved
guns
and
cannon
do
not
shoot
of
their
own
accord
the
most
modern
educational
system
does
not
make
a
coward
a
hero
no
what
won
the
battles
on
the
yalu
in
corea
and
manchuria
was
the
ghosts
of
our
fathers
guiding
our
hands
and
beating
in
our
hearts
they
are
not

those
ghosts
the
spirits
of

warlike
ancestors
to
those
who
have
eyes
to

they
are

scratch
a
japanese
of
the
most
advanced
ideas
and
he
will
show
a
samurai
the
great
inheritance
of
honor
of
valor
and
of
all
martial
virtues
is
as
professor
cramb
very
fitly
expresses
it
but
ours
on
trust
the
fief
inalienable
of
the
dead
and
of
the
generation
to
come
and
the
summons
of
the
present
is
to
guard
this
heritage
nor
to
bate
one
jot
of
the
ancient
spirit
the
summons
of
the
future
will
be
so
to
widen
its
scope
as
to
apply
it
in
all
walks
and
relations
of
life
it
has
been
predicted
and
predictions
have
been
corroborated
by
the
events
of
the
last
half
century
that
the
moral
system
of
feudal
japan
like
its
castles
and
its
armories
will
crumble
into
dust
and
new
ethics
rise
to
lead
new
japan
in
her
path
of
progress
desirable
and
probable
as
the
fulfilment
of
such
a
prophecy
is
we
must
not
forget
that
a
phoenix
rises
only
from
its
own
ashes
and
that
it
is
not
a
bird
of
passage
neither
does
it
fly
on
pinions
borrowed
from
other
birds
the
kingdom
of
god
is
within
you
it
does
not
come
rolling
down
the
mountains
however
lofty
it
does
not
come
sailing
across
the
seas
however
broad
god
has
granted
says
the
koran
to
every
people
a
prophet
in
its
own
tongue
the
seeds
of
the
kingdom
as
vouched
for
and
apprehended
by
the
japanese
mind
blossomed
in
bushido
now
its
days
are
closing
sad
to
say
before
its
full
fruition
and
we
turn
in
every
direction
for
other
sources
of
sweetness
and
light
of
strength
and
comfort
but
among
them
there
is
as
yet
nothing
found
to
take
its
place
the
profit
and
loss
philosophy
of
utilitarians
and
materialists
finds
favor
among
with
half
a
soul
the
only
other
ethical
system
which
is
powerful
enough
to
cope
with
utilitarianism
and
materialism
is
christianity
in
comparison
with
which
bushido
it
must
be
confessed
is
like
a
dimly
burning
wick
which
the
messiah
was
proclaimed
not
to
quench
but
to
fan
into
a
flame
like
his
hebrew
precursors
the
prophets
notably
isaiah
jeremiah
amos
and
habakkuk
bushido
laid
particular
stress
on
the
moral
conduct
of
rulers
and
public
men
and
of
nations
whereas
the
ethics
of
christ
which
deal
almost
solely
with
individuals
and
his
personal
followers
will
find
more
and
more
practical
application
as
individualism
in
its
capacity
of
a
moral
factor
grows
in
potency
the
domineering
of
nietzsche
itself
akin
in
some
respects
to
bushido
is
if
i
am
not
greatly
mistaken
a
passing
phase
or
temporary
reaction
against
what
he
terms
by
morbid
distortion
the
humble
of
the
nazarene
christianity
and
materialism
including
utilitarianism
or
will
the
future
reduce
them
to
still
more
archaic
forms
of
hebraism
and
hellenism
will
divide
the
world
between
them
lesser
systems
of
morals
will
ally
themselves
on
either
side
for
their
preservation
on
which
side
will
bushido
enlist
having
no
set
dogma
or
formula
to
defend
it
can
afford
to
disappear
as
an
entity
like
the
cherry
blossom
it
is
willing
to
die
at
the
first
gust
of
the
morning
breeze
but
a
total
extinction
will
never
be
its
lot
who
can
say
that
stoicism
is
dead
it
is
dead
as
a
system
but
it
is
alive
as
a
virtue
its
energy
and
vitality
are
still
felt
through
many
channels
of
life
in
the
philosophy
of
western
nations
in
the
jurisprudence
of
all
the
civilized
world
nay
wherever
man
struggles
to
raise
himself
above
himself
wherever
his
spirit
masters
his
flesh
by
his
own
exertions
there
we
see
the
immortal
discipline
of
zeno
at
work
bushido
as
an
independent
code
of
ethics
may
vanish
but
its
power
will
not
perish
from
the
earth
its
schools
of
martial
prowess
or
civic
honor
may
be
demolished
but
its
light
and
its
glory
will
long
survive
their
ruins
like
its
symbolic
flower
after
it
is
blown
to
the
four
winds
it
will
still
bless
mankind
with
the
perfume
with
which
it
will
enrich
life
ages
after
when
its
customaries
shall
have
been
buried
and
its
very
name
forgotten
its
odors
will
come
floating
in
the
air
as
from
a
unseen
hill
the
wayside
gaze
beyond
then
in
the
beautiful
language
of
the
quaker
poet
the
traveler
owns
the
grateful
sense
of
sweetness
near
he
knows
not
whence
and
pausing
takes
with
forehead
bare
the
benediction
of
the
air
