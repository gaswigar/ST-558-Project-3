chapter
i
the
outer
development
of
the
moving
pictures
it
is
arbitrary
to
say
where
the
development
of
the
moving
pictures
began
and
it
is
impossible
to
foresee
where
it
will
lead
what
invention
marked
the
beginning
was
it
the
first
device
to
introduce
movement
into
the
pictures
on
a
screen
or
did
the
development
begin
with
the
first
photographing
of
various
phases
of
moving
objects
or
did
it
start
with
the
first
presentation
of
successive
pictures
at
such
a
speed
that
the
impression
of
movement
resulted
or
was
the
birthday
of
the
new
art
when
the
experimenters
for
the
first
time
succeeded
in
projecting
such
rapidly
passing
pictures
on
a
wall
if
we
think
of
the
moving
pictures
as
a
source
of
entertainment
and
esthetic
enjoyment
we
may
see
the
germ
in
that
camera
obscura
which
allowed
one
glass
slide
to
pass
before
another
and
thus
showed
the
railway
train
on
one
slide
moving
over
the
bridge
on
the
other
glass
plate
they
were
popular
half
a
century
ago
on
the
other
hand
if
the
essential
feature
of
the
moving
pictures
is
the
combination
of
various
views
into
one
connected
impression
we
must
look
back
to
the
days
of
the
phenakistoscope
which
had
scientific
interest
only
it
is
more
than
eighty
years
since
it
was
invented
in
america
which
in
most
recent
times
has
become
the
classical
land
of
the
moving
picture
production
the
history
may
be
said
to
begin
with
the
days
of
the
chicago
exposition
when
edison
exhibited
his
kinetoscope
the
visitor
dropped
his
nickel
into
a
slot
the
little
motor
started
and
for
half
a
minute
he
saw
through
the
magnifying
glass
a
girl
dancing
or
some
street
boys
fighting
less
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
later
twenty
thousand
theaters
for
moving
pictures
are
open
daily
in
the
united
states
and
the
millions
get
for
their
nickel
long
hours
of
enjoyment
in
edison
small
box
into
which
only
one
at
a
time
could
peep
through
the
hole
nothing
but
a
few
trite
scenes
were
exhibited
in
those
twenty
thousand
theaters
which
grew
from
it
all
human
passions
and
emotions
find
their
stage
and
whatever
history
reports
or
science
demonstrates
or
imagination
invents
comes
to
life
on
the
screen
of
the
picture
palace
yet
this
development
from
edison
show
to
the
birth
of
a
nation
did
not
proceed
on
american
soil
that
slot
box
after
all
had
little
chance
for
popular
success
the
decisive
step
was
taken
when
pictures
of
the
edison
type
were
for
the
first
time
thrown
on
a
screen
and
thus
made
visible
to
a
large
audience
that
step
was
taken
in
london
the
moving
picture
theater
certainly
began
in
england
but
there
was
one
source
of
the
stream
springing
up
in
america
which
long
preceded
edison
the
photographic
efforts
of
the
englishman
muybridge
who
made
his
experiments
in
california
as
early
as
his
aim
was
to
have
photographs
of
various
phases
of
a
continuous
movement
for
instance
of
the
different
positions
which
a
trotting
horse
is
passing
through
his
purpose
was
the
analysis
of
the
movement
into
its
component
parts
not
the
synthesis
of
a
moving
picture
from
such
parts
yet
it
is
evident
that
this
too
was
a
necessary
step
which
made
the
later
triumphs
possible
if
we
combine
the
scientific
and
the
artistic
efforts
of
the
new
and
the
old
world
we
may
tell
the
history
of
the
moving
pictures
by
the
following
dates
and
achievements
in
the
year
a
doctor
roget
described
in
the
philosophical
transactions
an
interesting
optical
illusion
of
movement
resulting
for
instance
when
a
wheel
is
moving
along
behind
a
fence
of
upright
bars
the
discussion
was
carried
much
further
when
it
was
taken
up
a
few
years
later
by
a
master
of
the
craft
by
faraday
in
the
of
the
royal
institute
of
great
he
writes
in
on
a
peculiar
class
of
optical
deceptions
he
describes
there
a
large
number
of
subtle
experiments
in
which
cogwheels
of
different
forms
and
sizes
were
revolving
with
different
degrees
of
rapidity
and
in
different
directions
the
eye
saw
the
cogs
of
the
moving
rear
wheel
through
the
passing
cogs
of
the
front
wheel
the
result
is
the
appearance
of
movement
effects
which
do
not
correspond
to
an
objective
motion
the
impression
of
backward
movement
can
arise
from
forward
motions
quick
movement
from
slow
complete
rest
from
combinations
of
movements
for
the
first
time
the
impression
of
movement
was
synthetically
produced
from
different
elements
for
those
who
fancy
that
the
new
psychology
with
its
experimental
analysis
of
psychological
experiences
began
only
in
the
second
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
or
perhaps
even
with
the
foundation
of
the
psychological
laboratories
it
might
be
enlightening
to
study
those
discussions
of
the
early
thirties
the
next
step
leads
us
much
further
in
the
fall
of
stampfer
in
germany
and
plateau
in
france
independent
of
each
other
at
the
same
time
designed
a
device
by
which
pictures
of
objects
in
various
phases
of
movement
give
the
impression
of
continued
motion
both
secured
the
effect
by
cutting
fine
slits
in
a
black
disk
in
the
direction
of
the
radius
when
the
disk
is
revolved
around
its
center
these
slits
pass
the
eye
of
the
observer
if
he
holds
it
before
a
mirror
and
on
the
rear
side
of
the
disk
pictures
are
drawn
corresponding
to
the
various
slits
the
eye
will
see
one
picture
after
another
in
rapid
succession
at
the
same
place
if
these
little
pictures
give
us
the
various
stages
of
a
movement
for
instance
a
wheel
with
its
spokes
in
different
positions
the
whole
series
of
impressions
will
be
combined
into
the
perception
of
a
revolving
wheel
stampfer
called
them
the
stroboscopic
disks
plateau
the
phenakistoscope
the
smaller
the
slits
the
sharper
the
pictures
uchatius
in
vienna
constructed
an
apparatus
as
early
as
to
throw
these
pictures
of
the
stroboscopic
disks
on
the
wall
horner
followed
with
the
daedaleum
in
which
the
disk
was
replaced
by
a
hollow
cylinder
which
had
the
pictures
on
the
inside
and
holes
to
watch
them
from
without
while
the
cylinder
was
in
rotation
from
this
was
developed
the
popular
toy
which
as
the
zoötrope
or
bioscope
became
familiar
everywhere
it
was
a
revolving
black
cylinder
with
vertical
slits
on
the
inside
of
which
paper
strips
with
pictures
of
moving
objects
in
successive
phases
were
placed
the
clowns
sprang
through
the
hoop
and
repeated
this
whole
movement
with
every
new
revolution
of
the
cylinder
in
more
complex
instruments
three
sets
of
slits
were
arranged
above
one
another
one
set
corresponded
exactly
to
the
distances
of
the
pictures
and
the
result
was
that
the
moving
object
appeared
to
remain
on
the
same
spot
the
second
brought
the
slits
nearer
together
then
the
pictures
necessarily
produced
an
effect
as
if
the
man
were
really
moving
forward
while
he
performed
his
tricks
in
the
third
set
the
slits
were
further
distant
from
one
another
than
the
pictures
and
the
result
was
that
the
picture
moved
backward
the
scientific
principle
which
controls
the
moving
picture
world
of
today
was
established
with
these
early
devices
isolated
pictures
presented
to
the
eye
in
rapid
succession
but
separated
by
interruptions
are
perceived
not
as
single
impressions
of
different
positions
but
as
a
continuous
movement
but
the
pictures
of
movements
used
so
far
were
drawn
by
the
pen
of
the
artist
life
showed
to
him
everywhere
continuous
movements
his
imagination
had
to
resolve
them
into
various
instantaneous
positions
he
drew
the
horse
race
for
the
zoötrope
but
while
the
horses
moved
forward
nobody
was
able
to
say
whether
the
various
pictures
of
their
legs
really
corresponded
to
the
stages
of
the
actual
movements
thus
a
true
development
of
the
stroboscopic
effects
appeared
dependent
upon
the
fixation
of
the
successive
stages
this
was
secured
in
the
early
seventies
but
to
make
this
progress
possible
the
whole
wonderful
unfolding
of
the
photographer
art
was
needed
from
the
early
daguerreotype
which
presupposed
hours
of
exposure
to
the
instantaneous
photograph
which
fixes
the
picture
of
the
outer
world
in
a
small
fraction
of
a
second
we
are
not
concerned
here
with
this
technical
advance
with
the
perfection
of
the
sensitive
surface
of
the
photographic
plate
in
the
photographer
camera
had
reached
a
stage
at
which
it
was
possible
to
take
snapshot
pictures
but
this
alone
would
not
have
allowed
the
photographing
of
a
real
movement
with
one
camera
as
the
plates
could
not
have
been
exchanged
quickly
enough
to
catch
the
various
phases
of
a
short
motion
here
the
work
of
muybridge
sets
in
he
had
a
black
horse
trot
or
gallop
or
walk
before
a
white
wall
passing
cameras
on
the
path
of
the
horse
were
threads
which
the
horse
broke
one
after
another
and
each
one
released
the
spring
which
opened
the
shutter
of
an
instrument
the
movement
of
the
horse
was
thus
analyzed
into
pictures
of
successive
phases
and
for
the
first
time
the
human
eye
saw
the
actual
positions
of
a
horse
legs
during
the
gallop
or
trot
it
is
not
surprising
that
these
pictures
of
muybridge
interested
the
french
painters
when
he
came
to
paris
but
fascinated
still
more
the
great
student
of
animal
movements
the
physiologist
marey
he
had
contributed
to
science
many
an
intricate
apparatus
for
the
registration
of
movement
processes
marey
tambour
is
still
the
most
useful
instrument
in
every
physiological
and
psychological
laboratory
whenever
slight
delicate
movements
are
to
be
recorded
the
movement
of
a
bird
wings
interested
him
especially
and
at
his
suggestion
muybridge
turned
to
the
study
of
the
flight
of
birds
flying
pigeons
were
photographed
in
different
positions
each
picture
taken
in
a
part
of
a
second
but
marey
himself
improved
the
method
he
made
use
of
an
idea
which
the
astronomer
jannsen
had
applied
to
the
photographing
of
astronomical
processes
jannsen
photographed
for
instance
the
transit
of
the
planet
venus
across
the
sun
in
december
on
a
circular
sensitized
plate
which
revolved
in
the
camera
the
plate
moved
forward
a
few
degrees
every
minute
there
was
room
in
this
way
to
have
eighteen
pictures
of
different
phases
of
the
transit
on
the
marginal
part
of
the
one
plate
marey
constructed
the
apparatus
for
the
revolving
disk
so
that
the
intervals
instead
of
a
full
minute
became
only
of
a
second
on
the
one
revolving
disk
views
of
the
bird
in
motion
could
be
taken
this
brings
us
to
the
time
of
the
early
eighties
marey
remained
indefatigable
in
improving
the
means
for
quick
successive
snapshots
with
the
same
camera
human
beings
were
photographed
by
him
in
white
clothes
on
a
black
background
when
ten
pictures
were
taken
in
a
second
the
subtlest
motions
in
their
jumping
or
running
could
be
disentangled
the
leading
aim
was
still
decidedly
a
scientific
understanding
of
the
motions
and
the
combination
of
the
pictures
into
a
unified
impression
of
movement
was
not
the
purpose
least
of
all
was
mere
amusement
intended
about
that
time
anschütz
in
germany
followed
the
muybridge
suggestions
with
much
success
and
gave
to
this
art
of
photographing
the
movement
of
animals
and
men
a
new
turn
he
not
only
photographed
the
successive
stages
but
printed
them
on
a
long
strip
which
was
laid
around
a
horizontal
wheel
this
wheel
is
in
a
dark
box
and
the
eye
can
see
the
pictures
on
the
paper
strip
only
at
the
moment
when
the
light
of
a
geissler
tube
flashes
up
the
wheel
itself
has
such
electric
contacts
that
the
intervals
between
two
flashes
correspond
to
the
time
which
is
necessary
to
move
the
wheel
from
one
picture
to
the
next
however
quickly
the
wheel
may
be
revolved
the
lights
follow
one
another
with
the
same
rapidity
with
which
the
pictures
replace
one
another
during
the
movement
when
one
picture
moves
away
and
another
approaches
the
center
of
vision
all
is
dark
hence
the
eye
does
not
see
the
changes
but
gets
an
impression
as
if
the
picture
remained
at
the
same
spot
only
moving
the
bird
flaps
its
wings
and
the
horse
trots
it
was
really
a
perfect
kinetoscopic
instrument
yet
its
limitations
were
evident
no
movements
could
be
presented
but
simple
rhythmical
ones
inasmuch
as
after
one
revolution
of
the
wheel
the
old
pictures
returned
the
marching
men
appeared
very
lifelike
yet
they
could
not
do
anything
but
march
on
and
on
the
circumference
of
the
wheel
not
allowing
more
room
than
was
needed
for
about
forty
stages
of
the
moving
legs
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
the
step
if
the
picture
of
a
motion
was
to
go
beyond
these
simplest
rhythmical
movements
if
persons
in
action
were
really
to
be
shown
it
would
be
necessary
to
have
a
much
larger
number
of
pictures
in
instantaneous
illumination
the
wheel
principle
would
have
to
be
given
up
and
a
long
strip
with
pictures
would
be
needed
that
presupposed
a
correspondingly
long
set
of
exposures
and
this
demand
could
not
be
realized
as
long
as
the
pictures
were
taken
on
glass
plates
but
in
that
period
experiments
were
undertaken
on
many
sides
to
substitute
a
more
flexible
transparent
material
for
the
glass
translucent
papers
gelatine
celluloid
and
other
substances
were
tried
it
is
well
known
that
the
invention
which
was
decisive
was
the
film
which
eastman
in
rochester
produced
with
it
came
the
great
mechanical
improvement
the
use
of
the
two
rollers
one
roller
holds
the
long
strip
of
film
which
is
slowly
wound
over
the
second
the
device
familiar
to
every
amateur
photographer
today
with
film
photography
was
gained
the
possibility
not
only
of
securing
a
much
larger
number
of
pictures
than
marey
or
anschütz
made
with
their
circular
arrangements
but
of
having
these
pictures
pass
before
the
eye
illumined
by
quickly
succeeding
flashlights
for
any
length
of
time
moreover
instead
of
the
quick
illumination
the
passing
pictures
might
be
constantly
lighted
in
that
case
slits
must
pass
by
in
the
opposite
direction
so
that
each
picture
is
seen
for
a
moment
only
as
if
it
were
at
rest
this
idea
is
perfectly
realized
in
edison
machine
in
edison
kinetoscope
a
strip
of
celluloid
film
feet
in
length
with
a
series
of
pictures
each
of
an
inch
long
moved
continuously
over
a
series
of
rolls
the
pictures
passed
a
magnifying
lens
but
between
the
lens
and
the
picture
was
a
revolving
shutter
which
moved
with
a
speed
carefully
adjusted
to
the
film
the
opening
in
the
shutter
was
opposite
the
lens
at
the
moment
when
the
film
had
moved
on
of
an
inch
hence
the
eye
saw
not
the
passing
of
the
pictures
but
one
picture
after
another
at
the
same
spot
pretty
little
scenes
could
now
be
acted
in
half
a
minute
time
as
more
than
six
hundred
pictures
could
be
used
the
first
instrument
was
built
in
and
soon
after
the
chicago
world
fair
it
was
used
for
entertainment
all
over
the
world
the
wheel
of
anschütz
had
been
widespread
too
yet
it
was
considered
only
as
a
apparatus
with
edison
kinetoscope
the
moving
pictures
had
become
a
means
for
popular
amusement
and
entertainment
and
the
appetite
of
commercialism
was
whetted
at
once
efforts
to
improve
on
the
edison
machine
were
starting
everywhere
and
the
adjustment
to
the
needs
of
the
wide
public
was
in
the
foreground
crowning
success
came
almost
at
the
same
time
to
lumière
and
son
in
paris
and
to
paul
in
london
they
recognized
clearly
that
the
new
scheme
could
not
become
really
profitable
on
a
large
scale
as
long
as
only
one
person
at
a
time
could
see
the
pictures
both
the
french
manufacturers
of
photographic
supplies
and
the
english
engineer
considered
the
next
step
necessary
to
be
the
projection
of
the
films
upon
a
large
screen
yet
this
involved
another
fundamental
change
in
the
kinetoscope
the
films
passed
by
continuously
the
time
of
the
exposure
through
the
opening
in
the
revolving
shutter
had
to
be
extremely
short
in
order
to
give
distinct
pictures
the
slightest
lengthening
would
make
the
movement
of
the
film
itself
visible
and
produce
a
blurring
effect
this
time
was
sufficient
for
the
seeing
of
the
picture
it
could
not
be
sufficient
for
the
greatly
enlarged
view
on
the
wall
too
little
light
passed
through
to
give
a
distinct
image
hence
it
became
essential
to
transform
the
continuous
movement
of
the
film
into
an
intermittent
one
the
strip
of
film
must
be
drawn
before
the
lens
by
jerking
movements
so
that
the
real
motion
of
the
strip
would
occur
in
the
periods
in
which
the
shutter
was
closed
while
it
was
at
rest
for
the
fraction
of
time
in
which
the
light
of
the
projection
apparatus
passed
through
both
lumière
and
paul
overcame
this
difficulty
and
secured
an
intermittent
pushing
forward
of
the
pictures
for
of
an
inch
that
is
for
the
length
of
the
single
photograph
in
the
spring
of
paul
theatrograph
or
animatograph
was
completed
and
in
the
following
year
he
began
his
engagement
at
the
alhambra
theater
where
the
novelty
was
planned
as
a
vaudeville
show
for
a
few
days
but
stayed
for
many
a
year
since
it
proved
at
once
an
unprecedented
success
the
american
field
was
conquered
by
the
lumière
camera
the
eden
musée
was
the
first
place
where
this
french
kinematograph
was
installed
the
enjoyment
which
today
one
hundred
and
thousand
moving
picture
theaters
all
over
the
globe
bring
to
thirty
million
people
daily
is
dependent
upon
lumière
and
paul
invention
the
improvements
in
the
technique
of
taking
the
pictures
and
of
projecting
them
on
the
screen
are
legion
but
the
fundamental
features
have
not
been
changed
yes
on
the
whole
the
development
of
the
last
two
decades
has
been
a
conservative
one
the
fact
that
every
producer
tries
to
distribute
his
films
to
every
country
forces
a
standardization
on
the
entire
moving
picture
world
the
little
pictures
on
the
film
are
still
today
exactly
the
same
size
as
those
which
edison
used
for
his
kinetoscope
and
the
long
strips
of
film
are
still
gauged
by
four
round
perforations
at
the
side
of
each
to
catch
the
sprockets
which
guide
the
film
as
soon
as
the
moving
picture
show
had
become
a
feature
of
the
vaudeville
theater
the
longing
of
the
crowd
for
ever
new
entertainments
and
sensations
had
to
be
satisfied
if
the
success
was
to
last
the
mere
enjoyment
of
the
technical
wonder
as
such
necessarily
faded
away
and
the
interest
could
be
kept
up
only
if
the
scenes
presented
on
the
screen
became
themselves
more
and
more
enthralling
the
trivial
acts
played
in
less
than
a
minute
without
any
artistic
setting
and
without
any
rehearsal
or
preparation
soon
became
unsatisfactory
the
grandmother
who
washes
the
baby
and
even
the
street
boy
who
plays
a
prank
had
to
be
replaced
by
quick
little
comedies
stages
were
set
up
more
and
more
elaborate
scenes
were
created
the
film
grew
and
grew
in
length
competing
companies
in
france
and
later
in
the
united
states
england
germany
and
notably
in
italy
developed
more
and
more
ambitious
productions
as
early
as
the
eden
musée
in
new
york
produced
an
elaborate
setting
of
the
passion
play
in
nearly
fifty
thousand
pictures
which
needed
almost
an
hour
for
production
the
personnel
on
the
stage
increased
rapidly
huge
establishments
in
which
any
scenery
could
be
built
up
sprang
into
being
but
the
inclosed
scene
was
often
not
a
sufficient
background
the
kinematographic
camera
was
brought
to
mountains
and
seashore
and
soon
to
the
jungles
of
africa
or
to
central
asia
if
the
photoplay
demanded
exciting
scenes
on
picturesque
backgrounds
thousands
of
people
entered
into
the
battle
scenes
which
the
historical
drama
demanded
we
stand
today
in
the
midst
of
this
external
growth
of
which
no
one
dreamed
in
the
days
of
the
kinetoscope
yet
this
technical
progress
and
this
tremendous
increase
of
the
mechanical
devices
for
production
have
their
true
meaning
in
the
inner
growth
which
led
from
trite
episodes
to
the
height
of
tremendous
action
from
trivial
routine
to
a
new
and
most
promising
art
chapter
ii
the
inner
development
of
the
moving
pictures
it
was
indeed
not
an
external
technical
advance
only
which
led
from
edison
half
a
minute
show
of
the
little
boy
who
turns
on
the
hose
to
the
daughter
of
neptune
or
quo
vadis
or
cabiria
and
many
another
performance
which
fills
an
evening
the
advance
was
first
of
all
internal
it
was
an
esthetic
idea
yet
even
this
does
not
tell
the
whole
story
of
the
inner
growth
of
the
moving
pictures
as
it
points
only
to
the
progress
of
the
photoplay
it
leaves
out
of
account
the
fact
that
the
moving
pictures
appeal
not
merely
to
the
imagination
but
that
they
bring
their
message
also
to
the
intellect
they
aim
toward
instruction
and
information
just
as
between
the
two
covers
of
a
magazine
artistic
stories
stand
side
by
side
with
instructive
essays
scientific
articles
or
discussions
of
the
events
of
the
day
the
photoplay
is
accompanied
by
a
kinematoscopic
rendering
of
reality
in
all
its
aspects
whatever
in
nature
or
in
social
life
interests
the
human
understanding
or
human
curiosity
comes
to
the
mind
of
the
spectator
with
an
incomparable
intensity
when
not
a
lifeless
photograph
but
a
moving
picture
brings
it
to
the
screen
the
happenings
of
the
day
afford
the
most
convenient
material
as
they
offer
the
chance
for
constantly
changing
programmes
and
hence
the
ideal
conditions
for
a
novelty
seeking
public
no
actors
are
needed
the
dramatic
interest
is
furnished
by
the
political
and
social
importance
of
the
events
in
the
early
days
when
the
great
stages
for
the
production
of
photoplays
had
not
been
built
the
moving
picture
industry
relied
in
a
much
higher
degree
than
today
on
this
supply
from
the
surrounding
public
life
but
while
the
material
was
abundant
it
soon
became
rather
insipid
to
see
parades
and
processions
and
orators
and
even
where
the
immediate
interest
seemed
to
give
value
to
the
pictures
it
was
for
the
most
part
only
a
local
interest
and
faded
away
after
a
time
the
coronation
of
the
king
or
the
inauguration
of
the
president
the
earthquake
in
sicily
the
great
derby
come
after
all
too
seldom
moreover
through
the
strong
competition
only
the
first
comer
gained
the
profits
and
only
the
most
sensational
dashes
of
kinematographers
with
the
reporter
instinct
could
lead
to
success
in
the
eyes
of
the
spoiled
moving
picture
audiences
certainly
the
history
of
these
enterprises
is
full
of
adventures
worthy
to
rank
with
the
most
daring
feats
in
the
newspaper
world
we
hear
that
when
the
investiture
of
the
prince
of
wales
was
performed
at
carnarvon
at
four
in
the
afternoon
the
public
of
london
at
ten
of
the
same
day
saw
the
ceremony
on
the
screen
in
a
moving
picture
twelve
minutes
in
length
the
distance
between
the
two
places
is
two
hundred
miles
the
film
was
seven
hundred
and
fifty
feet
long
it
had
been
developed
and
printed
in
a
special
express
train
made
up
of
long
freight
cars
transformed
into
dark
rooms
and
fitted
with
tanks
for
the
developing
and
washing
and
with
a
machine
for
printing
and
drying
yet
on
the
whole
the
current
events
were
slowly
losing
ground
even
in
europe
while
america
had
never
given
such
a
large
share
of
interest
to
this
rival
of
the
newspaper
it
is
claimed
that
the
producers
in
america
disliked
these
topical
pictures
because
the
accidental
character
of
the
events
makes
the
production
irregular
and
interferes
too
much
with
the
steady
preparation
of
the
photoplays
only
when
the
war
broke
out
the
great
wave
of
excitement
swept
away
this
apathy
the
pictures
from
the
trenches
the
marches
of
the
troops
the
life
of
the
prisoners
the
movements
of
the
leaders
the
busy
life
behind
the
front
and
the
action
of
the
big
guns
absorbed
the
popular
interest
in
every
corner
of
the
world
while
the
picturesque
war
reporter
has
almost
disappeared
the
moving
picture
man
has
inherited
all
his
courage
patience
sensationalism
and
spirit
of
adventure
a
greater
photographic
achievement
however
than
the
picturing
of
the
social
and
historic
events
was
the
marvelous
success
of
the
kinematograph
with
the
life
of
nature
no
explorer
in
recent
years
has
crossed
distant
lands
and
seas
without
a
kinematographic
outfit
we
suddenly
looked
into
the
most
intimate
life
of
the
african
wilderness
there
the
elephants
and
giraffes
and
monkeys
passed
to
the
waterhole
not
knowing
that
the
moving
picture
man
was
turning
his
crank
in
the
top
of
a
tree
we
followed
scott
and
shackleton
into
the
regions
of
eternal
ice
we
climbed
the
himalayas
we
saw
the
world
from
the
height
of
the
aëroplane
and
every
child
in
europe
knows
now
the
wonders
of
niagara
but
the
kinematographer
has
not
sought
nature
only
where
it
is
gigantic
or
strange
he
follows
its
path
with
no
less
admirable
effect
when
it
is
idyllic
the
brook
in
the
woods
the
birds
in
their
nest
the
flowers
trembling
in
the
wind
have
brought
their
charm
to
the
delighted
eye
more
and
more
with
the
progress
of
the
new
art
but
the
wonders
of
nature
which
the
camera
unveils
to
us
are
not
limited
to
those
which
the
naked
eye
can
follow
the
technical
progress
led
to
the
attachment
of
the
microscope
after
overcoming
tremendous
difficulties
the
scientists
succeeded
in
developing
a
microscope
kinematography
which
multiplies
the
dimensions
a
hundred
thousand
times
we
may
see
on
the
screen
the
fight
of
the
bacteria
with
the
microscopically
small
blood
corpuscles
in
the
blood
stream
of
a
diseased
animal
yes
by
the
miracles
of
the
camera
we
may
trace
the
life
of
nature
even
in
forms
which
no
human
observation
really
finds
in
the
outer
world
out
there
it
may
take
weeks
for
the
orchid
to
bud
and
blossom
and
fade
in
the
picture
the
process
passes
before
us
in
a
few
seconds
we
see
how
the
caterpillar
spins
its
cocoon
and
how
it
breaks
it
and
how
the
butterfly
unfolds
its
wings
and
all
which
needed
days
and
months
goes
on
in
a
fraction
of
a
minute
new
interest
for
geography
and
botany
and
zoölogy
has
thus
been
aroused
by
these
developments
undreamed
of
in
the
early
days
of
the
kinematograph
and
the
scientists
themselves
have
through
this
new
means
of
technique
gained
unexpected
help
for
their
labors
the
last
achievement
in
this
universe
of
photoknowledge
is
the
magazine
on
the
screen
it
is
a
bold
step
which
yet
seemed
necessary
in
our
day
of
rapid
kinematoscopic
progress
the
popular
printed
magazines
in
america
had
their
heydey
in
the
muckraking
period
about
ten
years
ago
their
hold
on
the
imagination
of
the
public
which
wants
to
be
informed
and
entertained
at
the
same
time
has
steadily
decreased
while
the
power
of
the
moving
picture
houses
has
increased
the
picture
house
ought
therefore
to
take
up
the
task
of
the
magazines
which
it
has
partly
displaced
the
magazines
give
only
a
small
place
to
the
news
of
the
day
a
larger
place
to
articles
in
which
scholars
and
men
of
public
life
discuss
significant
problems
much
american
history
in
the
last
two
decades
was
deeply
influenced
by
the
columns
of
the
illustrated
magazines
those
men
who
reached
the
millions
by
such
articles
can
not
overlook
the
fact
they
may
approve
or
condemn
it
that
the
masses
of
today
prefer
to
be
taught
by
pictures
rather
than
by
words
the
audiences
are
assembled
anyhow
instead
of
feeding
them
with
mere
entertainment
why
not
give
them
food
for
serious
thought
it
seemed
therefore
a
most
fertile
idea
when
the
paramount
pictograph
was
founded
to
carry
intellectual
messages
and
ambitious
discussions
into
the
film
houses
political
and
economic
social
and
hygienic
technical
and
industrial
esthetic
and
scientific
questions
can
in
no
way
be
brought
nearer
to
the
grasp
of
millions
the
editors
will
have
to
take
care
that
the
discussions
do
not
degenerate
into
propaganda
but
so
must
the
editors
of
a
printed
magazine
among
the
scientists
the
psychologist
may
have
a
particular
interest
in
this
latest
venture
of
the
film
world
the
screen
ought
to
offer
a
unique
opportunity
to
interest
wide
circles
in
psychological
experiments
and
mental
tests
and
in
this
way
to
spread
the
knowledge
of
their
importance
for
vocational
guidance
and
the
practical
affairs
of
life
yet
that
power
of
the
moving
pictures
to
supplement
the
school
room
and
the
newspaper
and
the
library
by
spreading
information
and
knowledge
is
after
all
secondary
to
their
general
task
to
bring
entertainment
and
amusement
to
the
masses
this
is
the
chief
road
on
which
the
forward
march
of
the
last
twenty
years
has
been
most
rapid
the
theater
and
the
vaudeville
and
the
novel
had
to
yield
room
and
ample
room
to
the
play
of
the
flitting
pictures
what
was
the
real
principle
of
the
inner
development
on
this
artistic
side
the
little
scenes
which
the
first
pictures
offered
could
hardly
have
been
called
plays
they
would
have
been
unable
to
hold
the
attention
by
their
own
contents
their
only
charm
was
really
the
pleasure
in
the
perfection
with
which
the
apparatus
rendered
the
actual
movements
but
soon
touching
episodes
were
staged
little
humorous
scenes
or
melodramatic
actions
were
played
before
the
camera
and
the
same
emotions
stirred
which
up
to
that
time
only
the
true
theater
play
had
awakened
the
aim
seemed
to
be
to
have
a
real
substitute
for
the
stage
the
most
evident
gain
of
this
new
scheme
was
the
reduction
of
expenses
one
actor
is
now
able
to
entertain
many
thousand
audiences
at
the
same
time
one
stage
setting
is
sufficient
to
give
pleasure
to
millions
the
theater
can
thus
be
democratized
everybody
purse
allows
him
to
see
the
greatest
artists
and
in
every
village
a
stage
can
be
set
up
and
the
joy
of
a
true
theater
performance
can
be
spread
to
the
remotest
corner
of
the
lands
just
as
the
graphophone
can
multiply
without
limit
the
music
of
the
concert
hall
the
singer
and
the
orchestra
so
it
seemed
would
the
photoplay
reproduce
the
theater
performance
without
end
of
course
the
substitute
could
not
be
equal
to
the
original
the
color
was
lacking
the
real
depth
of
the
objective
stage
was
missing
and
above
all
the
spoken
word
had
been
silenced
the
few
interspersed
descriptive
texts
the
leaders
had
to
hint
at
that
which
in
the
real
drama
the
speeches
of
the
actors
explain
and
elaborate
it
was
thus
surely
only
the
shadow
of
a
true
theater
different
not
only
as
a
photograph
is
compared
with
a
painting
but
different
as
a
photograph
is
compared
with
the
original
man
and
yet
however
meager
and
shadowlike
the
moving
picture
play
appeared
compared
with
the
performance
of
living
actors
the
advantage
of
the
cheap
multiplication
was
so
great
that
the
ambition
of
the
producers
was
natural
to
go
forward
from
the
little
playlets
to
great
dramas
which
held
the
attention
for
hours
the
kinematographic
theater
soon
had
its
shakespeare
repertoire
ibsen
has
been
played
and
the
dramatized
novels
on
the
screen
became
legion
victor
hugo
and
dickens
scored
new
triumphs
in
a
few
years
the
way
from
the
silly
trite
practical
joke
to
hamlet
and
peer
gynt
was
covered
with
such
thoroughness
that
the
possibility
of
giving
a
photographic
rendering
of
any
thinkable
theater
performance
was
proven
for
all
time
but
while
this
movement
to
reproduce
stage
performances
went
on
elements
were
superadded
which
the
technique
of
the
camera
allowed
but
which
would
hardly
be
possible
in
a
theater
hence
the
development
led
slowly
to
a
certain
deviation
from
the
path
of
the
drama
the
difference
which
strikes
the
observer
first
results
from
the
chance
of
the
camera
man
to
set
his
scene
in
the
real
backgrounds
of
nature
and
culture
the
stage
manager
of
the
theater
can
paint
the
ocean
and
if
need
be
can
move
some
colored
cloth
to
look
like
rolling
waves
and
yet
how
far
is
his
effect
surpassed
by
the
superb
ocean
pictures
when
the
scene
is
played
on
the
real
cliffs
and
the
waves
are
thundering
at
their
foot
and
the
surf
is
foaming
about
the
actors
the
theater
has
its
painted
villages
and
vistas
its
city
streets
and
its
foreign
landscape
backgrounds
but
here
the
theater
in
spite
of
the
reality
of
the
actors
appears
thoroughly
unreal
compared
with
the
throbbing
life
of
the
street
scenes
and
of
the
foreign
crowds
in
which
the
camera
man
finds
his
local
color
but
still
more
characteristic
is
the
rapidity
with
which
the
whole
background
can
be
changed
in
the
moving
pictures
reinhardt
revolving
stage
had
brought
wonderful
surprises
to
the
and
had
shifted
the
scene
with
a
quickness
which
was
unknown
before
yet
how
slow
and
clumsy
does
it
remain
compared
with
the
routine
changes
of
the
photoplays
this
changing
of
background
is
so
easy
for
the
camera
that
at
a
very
early
date
this
new
feature
of
the
plays
was
introduced
at
first
it
served
mostly
humorous
purposes
the
public
of
the
crude
early
shows
enjoyed
the
flashlike
quickness
with
which
it
could
follow
the
eloper
over
the
roofs
of
the
town
upstairs
and
down
into
cellar
and
attic
and
jump
into
the
auto
and
race
over
the
country
roads
until
the
culprit
fell
over
a
bridge
into
the
water
and
was
caught
by
the
police
this
slapstick
humor
has
by
no
means
disappeared
but
the
rapid
change
of
scenes
has
meanwhile
been
put
into
the
service
of
much
higher
aims
the
development
of
an
artistic
plot
has
been
brought
to
possibilities
which
the
real
drama
does
not
know
by
allowing
the
eye
to
follow
the
hero
and
heroine
continuously
from
place
to
place
now
he
leaves
his
room
now
we
see
him
passing
along
the
street
now
he
enters
the
house
of
his
beloved
now
he
is
led
into
the
parlor
now
she
is
hurrying
to
the
library
of
her
father
now
they
all
go
to
the
garden
ever
new
stage
settings
sliding
into
one
another
technical
difficulties
do
not
stand
in
the
way
a
set
of
pictures
taken
by
the
camera
man
a
thousand
miles
away
can
be
inserted
for
a
few
feet
in
the
film
and
the
audience
sees
now
the
clubroom
in
new
york
and
now
the
snows
of
alaska
and
now
the
tropics
near
each
other
in
the
same
reel
moreover
the
ease
with
which
the
scenes
are
altered
allows
us
not
only
to
hurry
on
to
ever
new
spots
but
to
be
at
the
same
time
in
two
or
three
places
the
scenes
become
intertwined
we
see
the
soldier
on
the
battlefield
and
his
beloved
one
at
home
in
such
steady
alternation
that
we
are
simultaneously
here
and
there
we
see
the
man
speaking
into
the
telephone
in
new
york
and
at
the
same
time
the
woman
who
receives
his
message
in
washington
it
is
no
difficulty
at
all
for
the
photoplay
to
have
the
two
alternate
a
score
of
times
in
the
few
minutes
of
the
long
distance
conversation
but
with
the
quick
change
of
background
the
photoartists
also
gained
a
rapidity
of
motion
which
leaves
actual
men
behind
he
needs
only
to
turn
the
crank
of
the
apparatus
more
quickly
and
the
whole
rhythm
of
the
performance
can
be
brought
to
a
speed
which
may
strikingly
aid
the
farcical
humor
of
the
scene
and
from
here
it
was
only
a
step
to
the
performance
of
actions
which
could
not
be
carried
out
in
nature
at
all
at
first
this
idea
was
made
serviceable
to
rather
rough
comic
effects
the
policeman
climbed
up
the
solid
stone
front
of
a
high
building
the
camera
man
had
no
difficulty
in
securing
the
effects
as
it
was
only
necessary
to
have
the
actor
creep
over
a
flat
picture
of
the
building
spread
on
the
floor
every
day
brought
us
new
tricks
we
see
how
the
magician
breaks
one
egg
after
another
and
takes
out
of
each
egg
a
little
fairy
and
puts
one
after
another
on
his
hand
where
they
begin
to
dance
a
minuet
no
theater
could
ever
try
to
match
such
wonders
but
for
the
camera
they
are
not
difficult
the
little
dancers
were
simply
at
a
much
further
distance
from
the
camera
and
therefore
appeared
in
their
lilliputian
size
rich
artistic
effects
have
been
secured
and
while
on
the
stage
every
fairy
play
is
clumsy
and
hardly
able
to
create
an
illusion
in
the
film
we
really
see
the
man
transformed
into
a
beast
and
the
flower
into
a
girl
there
is
no
limit
to
the
trick
pictures
which
the
skill
of
the
experts
invent
the
divers
jump
feet
first
out
of
the
water
to
the
springboard
it
looks
magical
and
yet
the
camera
man
has
simply
to
reverse
his
film
and
to
run
it
from
the
end
to
the
beginning
of
the
action
every
dream
becomes
real
uncanny
ghosts
appear
from
nothing
and
disappear
into
nothing
mermaids
swim
through
the
waves
and
little
elves
climb
out
of
the
easter
lilies
as
the
crank
of
the
camera
which
takes
the
pictures
can
be
stopped
at
any
moment
and
the
turning
renewed
only
after
some
complete
change
has
been
made
on
the
stage
any
substitution
can
be
carried
out
without
the
public
knowing
of
the
break
in
the
events
we
see
a
man
walking
to
the
edge
of
a
steep
rock
leaving
no
doubt
that
it
is
a
real
person
and
then
by
a
slip
he
is
hurled
down
into
the
abyss
below
the
film
does
not
indicate
that
at
the
instant
before
the
fall
the
camera
has
been
stopped
and
the
actor
replaced
by
a
stuffed
dummy
which
begins
to
tumble
when
the
movement
of
the
film
is
started
again
but
not
only
dummies
of
the
same
size
can
be
introduced
a
little
model
brought
quite
near
to
the
camera
may
take
the
place
of
the
large
real
object
at
a
far
distance
we
see
at
first
the
real
big
ship
and
can
convince
ourselves
of
its
reality
by
seeing
actual
men
climbing
up
the
rigging
but
when
it
comes
to
the
final
shipwreck
the
movement
of
the
film
is
stopped
and
the
camera
brought
near
to
a
little
tank
where
a
miniature
model
of
the
ship
takes
up
the
rôle
of
the
original
and
explodes
and
really
sinks
to
its
watery
grave
while
through
this
power
to
make
impossible
actions
possible
unheard
of
effects
could
be
reached
all
still
remained
in
the
outer
framework
of
the
stage
the
photoplay
showed
a
performance
however
rapid
or
unusual
as
it
would
go
on
in
the
outer
world
an
entirely
new
perspective
was
opened
when
the
managers
of
the
film
play
introduced
the
and
similar
new
methods
as
every
friend
of
the
film
knows
the
is
a
scheme
by
which
a
particular
part
of
the
picture
perhaps
only
the
face
of
the
hero
or
his
hand
or
only
a
ring
on
his
finger
is
greatly
enlarged
and
replaces
for
an
instant
the
whole
stage
even
the
most
wonderful
creations
the
great
historical
plays
where
thousands
fill
the
battlefields
or
the
most
fantastic
caprices
where
fairies
fly
over
the
stage
could
perhaps
be
performed
in
a
theater
but
this
leaves
all
stagecraft
behind
suddenly
we
see
not
booth
himself
as
he
seeks
to
assassinate
the
president
but
only
his
hand
holding
the
revolver
and
the
play
of
his
excited
fingers
filling
the
whole
field
of
vision
we
no
longer
see
at
his
desk
the
banker
who
opens
the
telegram
but
the
opened
telegraphic
message
itself
takes
his
place
on
the
screen
for
a
few
seconds
and
we
read
it
over
his
shoulder
it
is
not
necessary
to
enumerate
still
more
changes
which
the
development
of
the
art
of
the
film
has
brought
since
the
days
of
the
kinetoscope
the
use
of
natural
backgrounds
the
rapid
change
of
scenes
the
intertwining
of
the
actions
in
different
scenes
the
changes
of
the
rhythms
of
action
the
passing
through
physically
impossible
experiences
the
linking
of
disconnected
movements
the
realization
of
supernatural
effects
the
gigantic
enlargement
of
small
details
these
may
be
sufficient
as
characteristic
illustrations
of
the
essential
trend
they
show
that
the
progress
of
the
photoplay
did
not
lead
to
a
more
and
more
perfect
photographic
reproduction
of
the
theater
stage
but
led
away
from
the
theater
altogether
superficial
impressions
suggest
the
opposite
and
still
leave
the
esthetically
careless
observer
in
the
belief
that
the
photoplay
is
a
cheap
substitute
for
the
real
drama
a
theater
performance
as
good
or
as
bad
as
a
photographic
reproduction
allows
but
this
traditional
idea
has
become
utterly
untrue
art
of
the
photoplay
has
developed
so
many
new
features
of
its
own
features
which
have
not
even
any
similarity
to
the
technique
of
the
stage
that
the
question
arises
is
it
not
really
a
new
art
which
long
since
left
behind
the
mere
film
reproduction
of
the
theater
and
which
ought
to
be
acknowledged
in
its
own
esthetic
independence
this
right
to
independent
recognition
has
so
far
been
ignored
practically
everybody
who
judged
the
photoplays
from
the
esthetic
point
of
view
remained
at
the
old
comparison
between
the
film
and
the
graphophone
the
photoplay
is
still
something
which
simply
imitates
the
true
art
of
the
drama
on
the
stage
may
it
not
be
on
the
contrary
that
it
does
not
imitate
or
replace
anything
but
is
in
itself
an
art
as
different
from
that
of
the
theater
as
the
painter
art
is
different
from
that
of
the
sculptor
and
may
it
not
be
high
time
in
the
interest
of
theory
and
of
practice
to
examine
the
esthetic
conditions
which
would
give
independent
rights
to
the
new
art
if
this
is
really
the
situation
it
must
be
a
truly
fascinating
problem
as
it
would
give
the
chance
to
watch
the
art
in
its
first
unfolding
a
new
esthetic
cocoon
is
broken
where
will
the
butterfly
wings
carry
him
we
have
at
last
reached
the
real
problem
of
this
little
book
we
want
to
study
the
right
of
the
photoplay
hitherto
ignored
by
esthetics
to
be
classed
as
an
art
in
itself
under
entirely
new
mental
life
conditions
what
we
need
for
this
study
is
evidently
first
an
insight
into
the
means
by
which
the
moving
pictures
impress
us
and
appeal
to
us
not
the
physical
means
and
technical
devices
are
in
question
but
the
mental
means
what
psychological
factors
are
involved
when
we
watch
the
happenings
on
the
screen
but
secondly
we
must
ask
what
characterizes
the
independence
of
an
art
what
constitutes
the
conditions
under
which
the
works
of
a
special
art
stand
the
first
inquiry
is
psychological
the
second
esthetic
the
two
belong
intimately
together
hence
we
turn
first
to
the
psychological
aspect
of
the
moving
pictures
and
later
to
the
artistic
one
part
i
the
psychology
of
the
photoplay
chapter
iii
depth
and
movement
readers
who
have
no
technical
interest
in
physiological
psychology
may
omit
chapter
iii
and
turn
directly
to
chapter
iv
on
attention
the
problem
is
now
quite
clear
before
us
do
the
photoplays
furnish
us
only
a
photographic
reproduction
of
a
stage
performance
is
their
aim
thus
simply
to
be
an
inexpensive
substitute
for
the
real
theater
and
is
their
esthetic
standing
accordingly
far
below
that
of
the
true
dramatic
art
related
to
it
as
the
photograph
of
a
painting
to
the
original
canvas
of
the
master
or
do
the
moving
pictures
bring
us
an
independent
art
controlled
by
esthetic
laws
of
its
own
working
with
mental
appeals
which
are
fundamentally
different
from
those
of
the
theater
with
a
sphere
of
its
own
and
with
ideal
aims
of
its
own
if
this
so
far
neglected
problem
is
ours
we
evidently
need
not
ask
in
our
further
discussions
about
all
which
books
on
moving
pictures
have
so
far
put
into
the
foreground
namely
the
physical
technique
of
producing
the
pictures
on
the
film
or
of
projecting
the
pictures
on
the
screen
or
anything
else
which
belongs
to
the
technical
or
physical
or
economic
aspect
of
the
photoplay
industry
moreover
it
is
then
evidently
not
our
concern
to
deal
with
those
moving
pictures
which
serve
mere
curiosity
or
the
higher
desires
for
information
and
instruction
those
educational
pictures
may
give
us
delight
and
certainly
much
esthetic
enjoyment
may
be
combined
with
the
intellectual
satisfaction
when
the
wonders
of
distant
lands
are
unveiled
to
us
the
landscape
setting
of
such
a
travel
film
may
be
a
thing
of
beauty
but
the
pictures
are
not
taken
for
sake
the
aim
is
to
serve
the
spread
of
knowledge
our
esthetic
interest
turns
to
the
means
by
which
the
photoplay
influences
the
mind
of
the
spectator
if
we
try
to
understand
and
to
explain
the
means
by
which
music
exerts
its
powerful
effects
we
do
not
reach
our
goal
by
describing
the
structure
of
the
piano
and
of
the
violin
or
by
explaining
the
physical
laws
of
sound
we
must
proceed
to
the
psychology
and
ask
for
the
mental
processes
of
the
hearing
of
tones
and
of
chords
of
harmonies
and
disharmonies
of
tone
qualities
and
tone
intensities
of
rhythms
and
phrases
and
must
trace
how
these
elements
are
combined
in
the
melodies
and
compositions
in
this
way
we
turn
to
the
photoplay
at
first
with
a
purely
psychological
interest
and
ask
for
the
elementary
excitements
of
the
mind
which
enter
into
our
experience
of
the
moving
pictures
we
now
disregard
entirely
the
idea
of
the
theater
performance
we
should
block
our
way
if
we
were
to
start
from
the
theater
and
were
to
ask
how
much
is
left
out
in
the
mere
photographic
substitute
we
approach
the
art
of
the
film
theater
as
if
it
stood
entirely
on
its
own
ground
and
extinguish
all
memory
of
the
world
of
actors
we
analyze
the
mental
processes
which
this
specific
form
of
artistic
endeavor
produces
in
us
to
begin
at
the
beginning
the
photoplay
consists
of
a
series
of
flat
pictures
in
contrast
to
the
plastic
objects
of
the
real
world
which
surrounds
us
but
we
may
stop
at
once
what
does
it
mean
to
say
that
the
surroundings
appear
to
the
mind
plastic
and
the
moving
pictures
flat
the
psychology
of
this
difference
is
easily
misunderstood
of
course
when
we
are
sitting
in
the
picture
palace
we
know
that
we
see
a
flat
screen
and
that
the
object
which
we
see
has
only
two
dimensions
and
but
not
the
third
dimension
of
depth
of
distance
toward
us
or
away
from
us
it
is
flat
like
a
picture
and
never
plastic
like
a
work
of
sculpture
or
architecture
or
like
a
stage
yet
this
is
knowledge
and
not
immediate
impression
we
have
no
right
whatever
to
say
that
the
scenes
which
we
see
on
the
screen
appear
to
us
as
flat
pictures
we
may
become
more
strongly
conscious
of
this
difference
between
an
object
of
our
knowledge
and
an
object
of
our
impression
if
we
remember
a
instrument
the
stereoscope
the
stereoscope
which
was
quite
familiar
to
the
parlor
of
a
former
generation
consists
of
two
prisms
through
which
the
two
eyes
look
toward
two
photographic
views
of
a
landscape
but
the
two
photographic
views
are
not
identical
the
landscape
is
taken
from
two
different
points
of
view
once
from
the
right
and
once
from
the
left
as
soon
as
these
two
views
are
put
into
the
stereoscope
the
right
eye
sees
through
the
prism
only
the
view
from
the
right
the
left
eye
only
the
view
from
the
left
we
know
very
well
that
only
two
flat
pictures
are
before
us
yet
we
can
not
help
seeing
the
landscape
in
strongly
plastic
forms
the
two
different
views
are
combined
in
one
presentation
of
the
landscape
in
which
the
distant
objects
appear
much
further
away
from
us
than
the
foreground
we
feel
immediately
the
depth
of
things
it
is
as
if
we
were
looking
at
a
small
plastic
model
of
the
landscape
and
in
spite
of
our
objective
knowledge
can
not
recognize
the
flat
pictures
in
the
solid
forms
which
we
perceive
it
can
not
be
otherwise
because
whenever
in
practical
life
we
see
an
object
a
vase
on
our
table
as
a
solid
body
we
get
the
impression
of
its
plastic
character
first
of
all
by
seeing
it
with
our
two
eyes
from
two
different
points
of
view
the
perspective
in
which
our
right
eye
sees
the
things
on
our
table
is
different
from
the
perspective
for
the
left
eye
our
plastic
seeing
therefore
depends
upon
this
combination
of
two
different
perspective
views
and
whenever
we
offer
to
the
two
eyes
two
such
views
they
must
be
combined
into
the
impression
of
the
substantial
thing
the
stereoscope
thus
illustrates
clearly
that
the
knowledge
of
the
flat
character
of
pictures
by
no
means
excludes
the
actual
perception
of
depth
and
the
question
arises
whether
the
moving
pictures
of
the
photoplay
in
spite
of
our
knowledge
concerning
the
flatness
of
the
screen
do
not
give
us
after
all
the
impression
of
actual
depth
it
may
be
said
offhand
that
even
the
complete
appearance
of
depth
such
as
the
stereoscope
offers
would
be
in
no
way
contradictory
to
the
idea
of
moving
pictures
then
the
photoplay
would
give
the
same
plastic
impression
which
the
real
stage
offers
all
that
would
be
needed
is
this
when
the
actors
play
the
scenes
not
a
single
but
a
double
camera
would
have
to
take
the
pictures
such
a
double
camera
focuses
the
scene
from
two
different
points
of
view
corresponding
to
the
position
of
the
two
eyes
both
films
are
then
to
be
projected
on
the
screen
at
the
same
time
by
a
double
projection
apparatus
which
secures
complete
correspondence
of
the
two
pictures
so
that
in
every
instance
the
left
and
the
right
view
are
overlapping
on
the
screen
this
would
give
of
course
a
chaotic
blurring
image
but
if
the
apparatus
which
projects
the
left
side
view
has
a
green
glass
in
front
of
the
lens
and
the
one
which
projects
the
right
side
view
a
red
glass
and
every
person
in
the
audience
has
a
pair
of
spectacles
with
the
left
glass
green
and
the
right
glass
red
a
cardboard
lorgnette
with
red
and
green
gelatine
paper
would
do
the
same
service
and
costs
only
a
few
cents
the
left
eye
would
see
only
the
left
view
the
right
eye
only
the
right
view
we
could
not
see
the
red
lines
through
the
green
glass
nor
the
green
lines
through
the
red
glass
in
the
moment
the
left
eye
gets
the
left
side
view
only
and
the
right
eye
the
right
side
view
the
whole
chaos
of
lines
on
the
screen
is
organized
and
we
see
the
pictured
room
on
the
screen
with
the
same
depth
as
if
it
were
really
a
solid
room
set
on
the
stage
and
as
if
the
rear
wall
in
the
room
were
actually
ten
or
twenty
feet
behind
the
furniture
in
the
front
the
effect
is
so
striking
that
no
one
can
overcome
the
feeling
of
depth
under
these
conditions
but
while
the
regular
motion
pictures
certainly
do
not
offer
us
this
complete
plastic
impression
it
would
simply
be
the
usual
confusion
between
knowledge
about
the
picture
and
its
real
appearance
if
we
were
to
deny
that
we
get
a
certain
impression
of
depth
if
several
persons
move
in
a
room
we
gain
distinctly
the
feeling
that
one
moves
behind
another
in
the
film
picture
they
move
toward
us
and
from
us
just
as
much
as
they
move
to
the
right
and
left
we
actually
perceive
the
chairs
or
the
rear
wall
of
the
room
as
further
away
from
us
than
the
persons
in
the
foreground
this
is
not
surprising
if
we
stop
to
think
how
we
perceive
the
depth
for
instance
of
a
real
stage
let
us
fancy
that
we
sit
in
the
orchestra
of
a
real
theater
and
see
before
us
the
stage
set
as
a
room
with
furniture
and
persons
in
it
we
now
see
the
different
objects
on
the
stage
at
different
distances
some
near
some
far
one
of
the
causes
was
just
mentioned
we
see
everything
with
our
right
or
our
left
eye
from
different
points
of
view
but
if
now
we
close
one
eye
and
look
at
the
stage
with
the
right
eye
only
the
plastic
effect
does
not
disappear
the
psychological
causes
for
this
perception
of
depth
with
one
eye
are
essentially
the
differences
of
apparent
size
the
perspective
relations
the
shadows
and
the
actions
performed
in
the
space
now
all
these
factors
which
help
us
to
grasp
the
furniture
on
the
stage
as
solid
and
substantial
play
their
rôle
no
less
in
the
room
which
is
projected
on
the
screen
we
are
too
readily
inclined
to
imagine
that
our
eye
can
directly
grasp
the
different
distances
in
our
surroundings
yet
we
need
only
imagine
that
a
large
glass
plate
is
put
in
the
place
of
the
curtain
covering
the
whole
stage
now
we
see
the
stage
through
the
glass
and
if
we
look
at
it
with
one
eye
only
it
is
evident
that
every
single
spot
on
the
stage
must
throw
its
light
to
our
eye
by
light
rays
which
cross
the
glass
plate
at
a
particular
point
for
our
seeing
it
would
make
no
difference
whether
the
stage
is
actually
behind
that
glass
plate
or
whether
all
the
light
rays
which
pass
through
the
plate
come
from
the
plate
itself
if
those
rays
with
all
their
different
shades
of
light
and
dark
started
from
the
surface
of
the
glass
plate
the
effect
on
the
one
eye
would
necessarily
be
the
same
as
if
they
originated
at
different
distances
behind
the
glass
this
is
exactly
the
case
of
the
screen
if
the
pictures
are
well
taken
and
the
projection
is
sharp
and
we
sit
at
the
right
distance
from
the
picture
we
must
have
the
same
impression
as
if
we
looked
through
a
glass
plate
into
a
real
space
the
photoplay
is
therefore
poorly
characterized
if
the
flatness
of
the
pictorial
view
is
presented
as
an
essential
feature
that
flatness
is
an
objective
part
of
the
technical
physical
arrangements
but
not
a
feature
of
that
which
we
really
see
in
the
performance
of
the
photoplay
we
are
there
in
the
midst
of
a
world
and
the
movements
of
the
persons
or
of
the
animals
or
even
of
the
lifeless
things
like
the
streaming
of
the
water
in
the
brook
or
the
movements
of
the
leaves
in
the
wind
strongly
maintain
our
immediate
impression
of
depth
many
secondary
features
characteristic
of
the
motion
picture
may
help
for
instance
by
a
optical
illusion
the
feeling
of
depth
is
strengthened
if
the
foreground
is
at
rest
and
the
background
moving
thus
the
ship
passing
in
front
of
the
motionless
background
of
the
harbor
by
no
means
suggests
depth
to
the
same
degree
as
the
picture
taken
on
the
gliding
ship
itself
so
that
the
ship
appears
to
be
at
rest
and
the
harbor
itself
passing
by
the
depth
effect
is
so
undeniable
that
some
minds
are
struck
by
it
as
the
chief
power
in
the
impressions
from
the
screen
vachel
lindsay
the
poet
feels
the
plastic
character
of
the
persons
in
the
foreground
so
fully
that
he
interprets
those
plays
with
much
individual
action
as
a
kind
of
sculpture
in
motion
he
says
the
little
far
off
people
on
the
oldfashioned
speaking
stage
do
not
appeal
to
the
plastic
sense
in
this
way
they
are
by
comparison
mere
bits
of
pasteboard
with
sweet
voices
while
on
the
other
hand
the
photoplay
foreground
is
full
of
dumb
giants
the
bodies
of
these
giants
are
in
high
sculptural
relief
others
have
emphasized
that
this
strong
feeling
of
depth
touches
them
most
when
persons
in
the
foreground
stand
with
a
far
distant
landscape
as
background
much
more
than
when
they
are
seen
in
a
room
psychologically
this
is
not
surprising
either
if
the
scene
were
a
real
room
every
detail
in
it
would
appear
differently
to
the
two
eyes
in
the
room
on
the
screen
both
eyes
receive
the
same
impression
and
the
result
is
that
the
consciousness
of
depth
is
inhibited
but
when
a
far
distant
landscape
is
the
only
background
the
impression
from
the
picture
and
life
is
indeed
the
same
the
trees
or
mountains
which
are
several
hundred
feet
distant
from
the
eye
give
to
both
eyes
exactly
the
same
impression
inasmuch
as
the
small
difference
of
position
between
the
two
eyeballs
has
no
influence
compared
with
the
distance
of
the
objects
from
our
face
we
would
see
the
mountains
with
both
eyes
alike
in
reality
and
therefore
we
feel
unhampered
in
our
subjective
interpretation
of
far
distant
vision
when
the
screen
offers
exactly
the
same
picture
of
the
mountains
to
our
two
eyes
hence
in
such
cases
we
believe
that
we
see
the
persons
really
in
the
foreground
and
the
landscape
far
away
we
are
never
deceived
we
are
fully
conscious
of
the
depth
and
yet
we
do
not
take
it
for
real
too
much
stands
in
the
way
some
unfavorable
conditions
are
still
deficiencies
of
the
technique
for
instance
the
camera
picture
in
some
respects
exaggerates
the
distances
if
we
see
through
the
open
door
of
the
rear
wall
into
one
or
two
other
rooms
they
appear
like
a
distant
corridor
moreover
we
have
ideal
conditions
for
vision
in
the
right
perspective
only
when
we
sit
in
front
of
the
screen
at
a
definite
distance
we
ought
to
sit
where
we
see
the
objects
in
the
picture
at
the
same
angle
at
which
the
camera
photographed
the
originals
if
we
are
too
near
or
too
far
or
too
much
to
one
side
we
perceive
the
plastic
scene
from
a
viewpoint
which
would
demand
an
entirely
different
perspective
than
that
which
the
camera
fixated
in
motionless
pictures
this
is
less
disturbing
in
moving
pictures
every
new
movement
to
or
from
the
background
must
remind
us
of
the
apparent
distortion
moreover
the
size
and
the
frame
and
the
whole
setting
strongly
remind
us
of
the
unreality
of
the
perceived
space
but
the
chief
point
remains
that
we
see
the
whole
picture
with
both
eyes
and
not
with
only
one
and
that
we
are
constantly
reminded
of
the
flatness
of
the
picture
because
the
two
eyes
receive
identical
impressions
and
we
may
add
an
argument
nearly
related
to
it
namely
that
the
screen
as
such
is
an
object
of
our
perception
and
demands
an
adaptation
of
the
eye
and
an
independent
localization
we
are
drawn
into
this
conflict
of
perception
even
when
we
look
into
a
mirror
if
we
stand
three
feet
from
a
large
mirror
on
the
wall
we
see
our
reflection
three
feet
from
our
eyes
in
the
plate
glass
and
we
see
it
at
the
same
time
six
feet
from
our
eye
behind
the
glass
both
localizations
take
hold
of
our
mind
and
produce
a
peculiar
interference
we
all
have
learned
to
ignore
it
but
characteristic
illusions
remain
which
indicate
the
reality
of
this
doubleness
in
the
case
of
the
picture
on
the
screen
this
conflict
is
much
stronger
certainly
see
the
depth
and
yet
we
can
not
accept
there
is
too
much
which
inhibits
belief
and
interferes
with
the
interpretation
of
the
people
and
landscape
before
us
as
truly
plastic
they
are
surely
not
simply
pictures
the
persons
can
move
toward
us
and
away
from
us
and
the
river
flows
into
a
distant
valley
and
yet
the
distance
in
which
the
people
move
is
not
the
distance
of
our
real
space
such
as
the
theater
shows
and
the
persons
themselves
are
not
flesh
and
blood
it
is
a
unique
inner
experience
which
is
characteristic
of
the
perception
of
the
photoplays
have
reality
with
all
its
true
dimensions
and
yet
it
keeps
the
fleeting
passing
surface
suggestion
without
true
depth
and
fullness
as
different
from
a
mere
picture
as
from
a
mere
stage
it
brings
our
mind
into
a
peculiar
complex
state
and
we
shall
see
that
this
plays
a
not
unimportant
part
in
the
mental
of
the
whole
photoplay
while
the
problem
of
depth
in
the
film
picture
is
easily
ignored
the
problem
of
movement
forces
itself
on
every
spectator
it
seems
as
if
here
the
really
essential
trait
of
the
film
performance
is
to
be
found
and
that
the
explanation
of
the
motion
in
the
pictures
is
the
chief
task
which
the
psychologist
must
meet
we
know
that
any
single
picture
which
the
film
of
the
photographer
has
fixed
is
immovable
we
know
furthermore
that
we
do
not
see
the
passing
by
of
the
long
strip
of
film
we
know
that
it
is
rolled
from
one
roll
and
rolled
up
on
another
but
that
this
movement
from
picture
to
picture
is
not
visible
it
goes
on
while
the
field
is
darkened
what
objectively
reaches
our
eye
is
one
motionless
picture
after
another
but
the
replacing
of
one
by
another
through
a
forward
movement
of
the
film
can
not
reach
our
eye
at
all
why
do
we
nevertheless
see
a
continuous
movement
the
problem
did
not
arise
with
the
kinetoscope
only
but
had
interested
the
preceding
generations
who
amused
themselves
with
the
phenakistoscope
and
the
stroboscopic
disks
or
the
magic
cylinder
of
the
zoötrope
and
bioscope
the
child
who
made
his
zoötrope
revolve
and
looked
through
the
slits
of
the
black
cover
in
the
drum
saw
through
every
slit
the
drawing
of
a
dog
in
one
particular
position
yet
as
the
slits
passed
the
eye
the
different
positions
blended
into
one
continuous
jumping
movement
of
the
poodle
but
this
stroboscopic
phenomenon
however
interesting
it
was
seemed
to
offer
hardly
any
difficulty
the
friends
of
the
zoötrope
surely
knew
another
little
plaything
the
thaumatrope
paris
had
invented
it
in
it
shows
two
pictures
one
on
the
front
one
on
the
rear
side
of
a
card
as
soon
as
the
card
is
quickly
revolved
about
a
central
axis
the
two
pictures
fuse
into
one
if
a
horse
is
on
one
side
and
a
rider
on
the
other
if
a
cage
is
on
one
and
a
bird
on
the
other
we
see
the
rider
on
the
horse
and
the
bird
in
the
cage
it
can
not
be
otherwise
it
is
simply
the
result
of
the
positive
afterimages
if
at
dark
we
twirl
a
glowing
joss
stick
in
a
circle
we
do
not
see
one
point
moving
from
place
to
place
but
we
see
a
continuous
circular
line
it
is
nowhere
broken
because
if
the
movement
is
quick
the
positive
afterimage
of
the
light
in
its
first
position
is
still
effective
in
our
eye
when
the
glowing
point
has
passed
through
the
whole
circle
and
has
reached
the
first
position
again
we
speak
of
this
effect
as
a
positive
afterimage
because
it
is
a
real
continuation
of
the
first
impression
and
stands
in
contrast
to
the
negative
afterimage
in
which
the
aftereffect
is
opposite
to
the
original
stimulus
in
the
case
of
a
negative
afterimage
the
light
impression
leaves
a
dark
spot
the
dark
impression
gives
a
light
afterimage
black
becomes
white
and
white
becomes
black
in
the
world
of
colors
red
leaves
a
green
and
green
a
red
afterimage
yellow
a
blue
and
blue
a
yellow
afterimage
if
we
look
at
the
crimson
sinking
sun
and
then
at
a
white
wall
we
do
not
see
red
light
spots
but
green
dark
spots
compared
with
these
negative
pictures
the
positive
afterimages
are
short
and
they
last
through
any
noticeable
time
only
with
rather
intense
illumination
yet
they
are
evidently
sufficient
to
bridge
the
interval
between
the
two
slits
in
the
stroboscopic
disk
or
in
the
zoötrope
the
interval
in
which
the
black
paper
passes
the
eye
and
in
which
accordingly
no
new
stimulus
reaches
the
nerves
the
routine
explanation
of
the
appearance
of
movement
was
accordingly
that
every
picture
of
a
particular
position
left
in
the
eye
an
afterimage
until
the
next
picture
with
the
slightly
changed
position
of
the
jumping
animal
or
of
the
marching
men
was
in
sight
and
the
afterimage
of
this
again
lasted
until
the
third
came
the
afterimages
were
responsible
for
the
fact
that
no
interruptions
were
noticeable
while
the
movement
itself
resulted
simply
from
the
passing
of
one
position
into
another
what
else
is
the
perception
of
movement
but
the
seeing
of
a
long
series
of
different
positions
if
instead
of
looking
through
the
zoötrope
we
watch
a
real
trotting
horse
on
a
real
street
we
see
its
whole
body
in
ever
new
progressing
positions
and
its
legs
in
all
phases
of
motion
and
this
continuous
series
is
our
perception
of
the
movement
itself
this
seems
very
simple
yet
it
was
slowly
discovered
that
the
explanation
is
far
too
simple
and
that
it
does
not
in
the
least
do
justice
to
the
true
experiences
with
the
advance
of
modern
laboratory
psychology
the
experimental
investigations
frequently
turned
to
the
analysis
of
our
perception
of
movement
in
the
last
thirty
years
many
researches
notably
those
of
stricker
exner
hall
james
fischer
stern
marbe
lincke
wertheimer
and
korte
have
thrown
new
light
on
the
problem
by
carefully
devised
experiments
one
result
of
them
came
quickly
into
the
foreground
of
the
newer
view
the
perception
of
movement
is
an
independent
experience
which
can
not
be
reduced
to
a
simple
seeing
of
a
series
of
different
positions
a
characteristic
content
of
consciousness
must
be
added
to
such
a
series
of
visual
impressions
the
mere
idea
of
succeeding
phases
of
movement
is
not
at
all
the
original
movement
idea
this
is
suggested
first
by
the
various
illusions
of
movement
we
may
believe
that
we
perceive
a
movement
where
no
actual
changes
of
visual
impressions
occur
this
to
be
sure
may
result
from
a
mere
misinterpretation
of
the
impression
for
instance
when
in
the
railway
train
at
the
station
we
look
out
of
the
window
and
believe
suddenly
that
our
train
is
moving
while
in
reality
the
train
on
the
neighboring
track
has
started
it
is
the
same
when
we
see
the
moon
floating
quickly
through
the
motionless
clouds
we
are
inclined
to
consider
as
being
at
rest
that
which
we
fixate
and
to
interpret
the
relative
changes
in
the
field
of
vision
as
movements
of
those
parts
which
we
do
not
fixate
but
it
is
different
when
we
come
for
instance
to
those
illusions
in
which
movement
is
forced
on
our
perception
by
contrast
and
aftereffect
we
look
from
a
bridge
into
the
flowing
water
and
if
we
turn
our
eyes
toward
the
land
the
motionless
shore
seems
to
swim
in
the
opposite
direction
it
is
not
sufficient
in
such
cases
to
refer
to
contrasting
eye
movements
it
can
easily
be
shown
by
experiments
that
these
movements
and
in
the
field
of
vision
can
proceed
in
opposite
directions
at
the
same
time
and
no
eye
of
course
is
able
to
move
upward
and
downward
or
right
and
left
in
the
same
moment
a
very
characteristic
experiment
can
be
performed
with
a
black
spiral
line
on
a
white
disk
if
we
revolve
such
a
disk
slowly
around
its
center
the
spiral
line
produces
the
impression
of
a
continuous
enlargement
of
concentric
curves
the
lines
start
at
the
center
and
expand
until
they
disappear
in
the
periphery
if
we
look
for
a
minute
or
two
into
this
play
of
the
expanding
curves
and
then
turn
our
eyes
to
the
face
of
a
neighbor
we
see
at
once
how
the
features
of
the
face
begin
to
shrink
it
looks
as
if
the
whole
face
were
elastically
drawn
toward
its
center
if
we
revolve
the
disk
in
the
opposite
direction
the
curves
seem
to
move
from
the
edge
of
the
disk
toward
the
center
becoming
smaller
and
smaller
and
if
then
we
look
toward
a
face
the
person
seems
to
swell
up
and
every
point
in
the
face
seems
to
move
from
the
nose
toward
the
chin
or
forehead
or
ears
our
eye
which
watches
such
an
aftereffect
can
not
really
move
at
the
same
time
from
the
center
of
the
face
toward
both
ears
and
the
hair
and
the
chin
the
impression
of
movement
must
therefore
have
other
conditions
than
the
actual
performance
of
the
movements
and
above
all
it
is
clear
from
such
tests
that
the
seeing
of
the
movements
is
a
unique
experience
which
can
be
entirely
independent
from
the
actual
seeing
of
successive
positions
the
eye
itself
gets
the
impression
of
a
face
at
rest
and
yet
we
see
the
face
in
the
one
case
shrinking
in
the
other
case
swelling
in
the
one
case
every
point
apparently
moving
toward
the
center
in
the
other
case
apparently
moving
away
from
the
center
the
experience
of
movement
is
here
evidently
produced
by
the
spectator
mind
and
not
excited
from
without
we
may
approach
the
same
result
also
from
experiments
of
very
different
kind
if
a
flash
of
light
at
one
point
is
followed
by
a
flash
at
another
point
after
a
very
short
time
about
a
twentieth
of
a
second
the
two
lights
appear
to
us
simultaneous
the
first
light
is
still
fully
visible
when
the
second
flashes
and
it
can
not
be
noticed
that
the
second
comes
later
than
the
first
if
now
in
the
same
short
time
interval
the
first
light
moves
toward
the
second
point
we
should
expect
that
we
would
see
the
whole
process
as
a
lighted
line
at
rest
inasmuch
as
the
beginning
and
the
end
point
appear
simultaneous
if
the
end
is
reached
less
than
a
twentieth
of
a
second
after
the
starting
point
but
the
experiment
shows
the
opposite
result
instead
of
the
expected
lighted
line
we
see
in
this
case
an
actual
movement
from
one
point
to
the
other
again
we
must
conclude
that
the
movement
is
more
than
the
mere
seeing
of
successive
positions
as
in
this
case
we
see
the
movement
while
the
isolated
positions
do
not
appear
as
successive
but
as
simultaneous
another
group
of
interesting
phenomena
of
movement
may
be
formed
from
those
cases
in
which
the
moving
object
is
more
easily
noticed
than
the
impressions
of
the
whole
field
through
which
the
movement
is
carried
out
we
may
overlook
an
area
in
our
visual
field
especially
when
it
lies
far
to
one
side
from
our
fixation
point
but
as
soon
as
anything
moves
in
that
area
our
attention
is
drawn
we
notice
the
movement
more
quickly
than
the
whole
background
in
which
the
movement
is
executed
the
fluttering
of
kerchiefs
at
a
far
distance
or
the
waving
of
flags
for
signaling
is
characteristic
all
indicate
that
the
movement
is
to
us
something
different
from
merely
seeing
an
object
first
at
one
and
afterward
at
another
place
we
can
easily
find
the
analogy
in
other
senses
if
we
touch
our
forehead
or
the
back
of
our
hand
with
two
blunt
compass
points
so
that
the
two
points
are
about
a
third
of
an
inch
distant
from
each
other
we
do
not
discriminate
the
two
points
as
two
but
we
perceive
the
impression
as
that
of
one
point
we
can
not
discriminate
the
one
pressure
point
from
the
other
but
if
we
move
the
point
of
a
pencil
to
and
fro
from
one
point
to
the
other
we
perceive
distinctly
the
movement
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
is
a
movement
between
two
end
points
which
could
not
be
discriminated
it
is
wholly
characteristic
that
the
experimenter
in
every
field
of
sensations
visual
or
acoustical
or
tactual
often
finds
himself
before
the
experience
of
having
noticed
a
movement
while
he
is
unable
to
say
in
which
direction
the
movement
occurred
we
are
familiar
with
the
illusions
in
which
we
believe
that
we
see
something
which
only
our
imagination
supplies
if
an
unfamiliar
printed
word
is
exposed
to
our
eye
for
the
twentieth
part
of
a
second
we
readily
substitute
a
familiar
word
with
similar
letters
everybody
knows
how
difficult
it
is
to
read
proofs
we
overlook
the
misprints
that
is
we
replace
the
wrong
letters
which
are
actually
in
our
field
of
vision
by
imaginary
right
letters
which
correspond
to
our
expectations
are
we
not
also
familiar
with
the
experience
of
supplying
by
our
fancy
the
associative
image
of
a
movement
when
only
the
starting
point
and
the
end
point
are
given
if
a
skillful
suggestion
influences
our
mind
the
prestidigitator
stands
on
one
side
of
the
stage
when
he
apparently
throws
the
costly
watch
against
the
mirror
on
the
other
side
of
the
stage
the
audience
sees
his
suggestive
hand
movement
and
the
disappearance
of
the
watch
and
sees
twenty
feet
away
the
shattering
of
the
mirror
the
suggestible
spectator
can
not
help
seeing
the
flight
of
the
watch
across
the
stage
the
recent
experiments
by
wertheimer
and
korte
have
gone
into
still
subtler
details
both
experimenters
worked
with
a
delicate
instrument
in
which
two
light
lines
on
a
dark
ground
could
be
exposed
in
very
quick
succession
and
in
which
it
was
possible
to
vary
the
position
of
the
lines
the
distance
of
the
lines
the
intensity
of
their
light
the
time
exposure
of
each
and
the
time
between
the
appearance
of
the
first
and
of
the
second
they
studied
all
these
factors
and
moreover
the
influence
of
differently
directed
attention
and
suggestive
attitude
if
a
vertical
line
is
immediately
followed
by
a
horizontal
the
two
together
may
give
the
impression
of
one
right
angle
if
the
time
between
the
vertical
and
the
horizontal
line
is
long
first
one
and
then
the
other
is
seen
but
at
a
certain
length
of
the
time
interval
a
new
effect
is
reached
we
see
the
vertical
line
falling
over
and
lying
flat
like
the
horizontal
line
if
the
eyes
are
fixed
on
the
point
in
the
midst
of
the
angle
we
might
expect
that
this
movement
phenomenon
would
stop
but
the
opposite
is
the
case
the
apparent
movement
from
the
vertical
to
the
horizontal
has
to
pass
our
fixation
point
and
it
seems
that
we
ought
now
to
recognize
clearly
that
there
is
nothing
between
those
two
positions
that
the
intermediate
phases
of
the
movement
are
lacking
and
yet
the
experiment
shows
that
under
these
circumstances
we
frequently
get
the
strongest
impression
of
motion
if
we
use
two
horizontal
lines
the
one
above
the
other
we
see
if
the
right
time
interval
is
chosen
that
the
upper
one
moves
downward
toward
the
lower
but
we
can
introduce
there
a
very
interesting
variation
if
we
make
the
lower
line
which
appears
objectively
after
the
upper
one
more
intense
the
total
impression
is
one
which
begins
with
the
lower
we
see
first
the
lower
line
moving
toward
the
upper
one
which
also
approaches
the
lower
and
then
follows
the
second
phase
in
which
both
appear
to
fall
down
to
the
position
of
the
lower
one
it
is
not
necessary
to
go
further
into
details
in
order
to
demonstrate
that
the
apparent
movement
is
in
no
way
the
mere
result
of
an
afterimage
and
that
the
impression
of
motion
is
surely
more
than
the
mere
perception
of
successive
phases
of
movement
the
movement
is
in
these
cases
not
really
seen
from
without
but
is
superadded
by
the
action
of
the
mind
to
motionless
pictures
the
statement
that
our
impression
of
movement
does
not
result
simply
from
the
seeing
of
successive
stages
but
includes
a
higher
mental
act
into
which
the
successive
visual
impressions
enter
merely
as
factors
is
in
itself
not
really
an
explanation
we
have
not
settled
by
it
the
nature
of
that
higher
central
process
but
it
is
enough
for
us
to
see
that
the
impression
of
the
continuity
of
the
motion
results
from
a
complex
mental
process
by
which
the
various
pictures
are
held
together
in
the
unity
of
a
higher
act
nothing
can
characterize
the
situation
more
clearly
than
the
fact
which
has
been
demonstrated
by
many
experiments
namely
that
this
feeling
of
movement
is
in
no
way
interfered
with
by
the
distinct
consciousness
that
important
phases
of
the
movement
are
lacking
on
the
contrary
under
certain
circumstances
we
become
still
more
fully
aware
of
this
apparent
motion
created
by
our
inner
activity
when
we
are
conscious
of
the
interruptions
between
the
various
phases
of
movement
we
come
to
the
consequences
what
is
then
the
difference
between
seeing
motion
in
the
photoplay
and
seeing
it
on
the
real
stage
there
on
the
stage
where
the
actors
move
the
eye
really
receives
a
continuous
series
each
position
goes
over
into
the
next
without
any
interruption
the
spectator
receives
everything
from
without
and
the
whole
movement
which
he
sees
is
actually
going
on
in
the
world
of
space
without
and
accordingly
in
his
eye
but
if
he
faces
the
film
world
motion
which
he
sees
appears
to
be
a
true
motion
and
yet
is
created
by
his
own
the
afterimages
of
the
successive
pictures
are
not
sufficient
to
produce
a
substitute
for
the
continuous
outer
stimulation
the
essential
condition
is
rather
the
inner
mental
activity
which
unites
the
separate
phases
in
the
idea
of
connected
action
thus
we
have
reached
the
exact
counterpart
of
our
results
when
we
analyzed
the
perception
of
depth
we
see
actual
depth
in
the
pictures
and
yet
we
are
every
instant
aware
that
it
is
not
real
depth
and
that
the
persons
are
not
really
plastic
it
is
only
a
suggestion
of
depth
a
depth
created
by
our
own
activity
but
not
actually
seen
because
essential
conditions
for
the
true
perception
of
depth
are
lacking
now
we
find
that
the
movement
too
is
perceived
but
that
the
eye
does
not
receive
the
impressions
of
true
movement
it
is
only
a
suggestion
of
movement
and
the
idea
of
motion
is
to
a
high
degree
the
product
of
our
own
reaction
and
movement
alike
come
to
us
in
the
moving
picture
world
not
as
hard
facts
but
as
a
mixture
of
fact
and
symbol
they
are
present
and
yet
they
are
not
in
the
things
we
invest
the
impressions
with
the
theater
has
both
depth
and
motion
without
any
subjective
help
the
screen
has
them
and
yet
lacks
them
we
see
things
distant
and
moving
but
we
furnish
to
them
more
than
we
receive
we
create
the
depth
and
the
continuity
through
our
mental
mechanism
chapter
iv
attention
the
mere
perception
of
the
men
and
women
and
of
the
background
with
all
their
depth
and
their
motion
furnishes
only
the
material
the
scene
which
keeps
our
interest
alive
certainly
involves
much
more
than
the
simple
impression
of
moving
and
distant
objects
we
must
accompany
those
sights
with
a
wealth
of
ideas
they
must
have
a
meaning
for
us
they
must
be
enriched
by
our
own
imagination
they
must
awaken
the
remnants
of
earlier
experiences
they
must
stir
up
our
feelings
and
emotions
they
must
play
on
our
suggestibility
they
must
start
ideas
and
thoughts
they
must
be
linked
in
our
mind
with
the
continuous
chain
of
the
play
and
they
must
draw
our
attention
constantly
to
the
important
and
essential
element
of
the
action
an
abundance
of
such
inner
processes
must
meet
the
world
of
impressions
and
the
psychological
analysis
has
only
started
when
perception
of
depth
and
movement
alone
are
considered
if
we
hear
chinese
we
perceive
the
sounds
but
there
is
no
inner
response
to
the
words
they
are
meaningless
and
dead
for
us
we
have
no
interest
in
them
if
we
hear
the
same
thoughts
expressed
in
our
mother
tongue
every
syllable
carries
its
meaning
and
message
then
we
are
readily
inclined
to
fancy
that
this
additional
significance
which
belongs
to
the
familiar
language
and
which
is
absent
from
the
foreign
one
is
something
which
comes
to
us
in
the
perception
itself
as
if
the
meaning
too
were
passing
through
the
channels
of
our
ears
but
psychologically
the
meaning
is
ours
in
learning
the
language
we
have
learned
to
add
associations
and
reactions
of
our
own
to
the
sounds
which
we
perceive
it
is
not
different
with
the
optical
perceptions
the
best
does
not
come
from
without
of
all
internal
functions
which
create
the
meaning
of
the
world
around
us
the
most
central
is
the
attention
the
chaos
of
the
surrounding
impressions
is
organized
into
a
real
cosmos
of
experience
by
our
selection
of
that
which
is
significant
and
of
consequence
this
is
true
for
life
and
stage
alike
our
attention
must
be
drawn
now
here
now
there
if
we
want
to
bind
together
that
which
is
scattered
in
the
space
before
us
everything
must
be
shaded
by
attention
and
inattention
whatever
is
focused
by
our
attention
wins
emphasis
and
irradiates
meaning
over
the
course
of
events
in
practical
life
we
discriminate
between
voluntary
and
involuntary
attention
we
call
it
voluntary
if
we
approach
the
impressions
with
an
idea
in
our
mind
as
to
what
we
want
to
focus
our
attention
on
we
carry
our
personal
interest
our
own
idea
into
the
observation
of
the
objects
our
attention
has
chosen
its
aim
beforehand
and
we
ignore
all
that
does
not
fulfil
this
specific
interest
all
our
working
is
controlled
by
such
voluntary
attention
we
have
the
idea
of
the
goal
which
we
want
to
reach
in
our
mind
beforehand
and
subordinate
all
which
we
meet
to
this
selective
energy
through
our
voluntary
attention
we
seek
something
and
accept
the
offering
of
the
surroundings
only
in
so
far
as
it
brings
us
what
we
are
seeking
it
is
quite
different
with
the
involuntary
attention
the
guiding
influence
here
comes
from
without
the
cue
for
the
focusing
of
our
attention
lies
in
the
events
which
we
perceive
what
is
loud
and
shining
and
unusual
attracts
our
involuntary
attention
we
must
turn
our
mind
to
a
place
where
an
explosion
occurs
we
must
read
the
glaring
electric
signs
which
flash
up
to
be
sure
the
perceptions
which
force
themselves
on
our
involuntary
attention
may
get
their
motive
power
from
our
own
reactions
everything
which
appeals
to
our
natural
instincts
everything
which
stirs
up
hope
or
fear
enthusiasm
or
indignation
or
any
strong
emotional
excitement
will
get
control
of
our
attention
but
in
spite
of
this
circuit
through
our
emotional
responses
the
starting
point
lies
without
and
our
attention
is
accordingly
of
the
involuntary
type
in
our
daily
activity
voluntary
and
involuntary
attention
are
always
intertwined
our
life
is
a
great
compromise
between
that
which
our
voluntary
attention
aims
at
and
that
which
the
aims
of
the
surrounding
world
force
on
our
involuntary
attention
how
does
the
theater
performance
differ
in
this
respect
from
life
might
we
not
say
that
voluntary
attention
is
eliminated
from
the
sphere
of
art
and
that
the
audience
is
necessarily
following
the
lead
of
an
attention
which
receives
all
its
cues
from
the
work
of
art
itself
and
which
therefore
acts
involuntarily
to
be
sure
we
may
approach
a
theater
performance
with
a
voluntary
purpose
of
our
own
for
instance
we
may
be
interested
in
a
particular
actor
and
may
watch
him
with
our
opera
glass
all
the
time
whenever
he
is
on
the
stage
even
in
scenes
in
which
his
rôle
is
insignificant
and
in
which
the
artistic
interest
ought
to
belong
to
the
other
actors
but
such
voluntary
selection
has
evidently
nothing
to
do
with
the
theater
performance
as
such
by
such
behavior
we
break
the
spell
in
which
the
artistic
drama
ought
to
hold
us
we
disregard
the
real
shadings
of
the
play
and
by
mere
personal
side
interests
put
emphasis
where
it
does
not
belong
if
we
really
enter
into
the
spirit
of
the
play
our
attention
is
constantly
drawn
in
accordance
with
the
intentions
of
the
producers
surely
the
theater
has
no
lack
of
means
to
draw
this
involuntary
attention
to
any
important
point
to
begin
with
the
actor
who
speaks
holds
our
attention
more
strongly
than
the
actors
who
at
that
time
are
silent
yet
the
contents
of
the
words
may
direct
our
interest
to
anybody
else
on
the
stage
we
watch
him
whom
the
words
accuse
or
betray
or
delight
but
the
mere
interest
springing
from
words
can
not
in
the
least
explain
that
constantly
shifting
action
of
our
involuntary
attention
during
a
theater
performance
the
movements
of
the
actors
are
essential
the
pantomime
without
words
can
take
the
place
of
the
drama
and
still
appeal
to
us
with
overwhelming
power
the
actor
who
comes
to
the
foreground
of
the
stage
is
at
once
in
the
foreground
of
our
consciousness
he
who
lifts
his
arm
while
the
others
stand
quiet
has
gained
our
attention
above
all
every
gesture
every
play
of
the
features
brings
order
and
rhythm
into
the
manifoldness
of
the
impressions
and
organizes
them
for
our
mind
again
the
quick
action
the
unusual
action
the
repeated
action
the
unexpected
action
the
action
with
strong
outer
effect
will
force
itself
on
our
mind
and
unbalance
the
mental
equilibrium
the
question
arises
how
does
the
photoplay
secure
the
needed
shifting
of
attention
here
too
involuntary
attention
alone
can
be
expected
an
attention
which
undertakes
its
explorations
guided
by
preconceived
ideas
instead
of
yielding
to
the
demands
of
the
play
would
lack
adjustment
to
its
task
we
might
sit
through
the
photoplay
with
the
voluntary
intention
of
watching
the
pictures
with
a
scientific
interest
in
order
to
detect
some
mechanical
traits
of
the
camera
or
with
a
practical
interest
in
order
to
look
up
some
new
fashions
or
with
a
professional
interest
in
order
to
find
out
in
what
new
england
scenery
these
pictures
of
palestine
might
have
been
photographed
but
none
of
these
aspects
has
anything
to
do
with
the
photoplay
if
we
follow
the
play
in
a
genuine
attitude
of
theatrical
interest
we
must
accept
those
cues
for
our
attention
which
the
playwright
and
the
producers
have
prepared
for
us
but
there
is
surely
no
lack
of
means
by
which
our
mind
can
be
influenced
and
directed
in
the
rapid
play
of
the
pictures
of
course
the
spoken
word
is
lacking
we
know
how
often
the
words
on
the
screen
serve
as
substitutes
for
the
speech
of
the
actors
they
appear
sometimes
as
leaders
between
the
pictures
sometimes
even
thrown
into
the
picture
itself
sometimes
as
content
of
a
written
letter
or
of
a
telegram
or
of
a
newspaper
clipping
which
is
projected
like
a
picture
strongly
enlarged
on
the
screen
in
all
these
cases
the
words
themselves
prescribe
the
line
in
which
the
attention
must
move
and
force
the
interest
of
the
spectator
toward
the
new
goal
but
such
help
by
the
writing
on
the
wall
is
after
all
extraneous
to
the
original
character
of
the
photoplay
as
long
as
we
study
the
psychological
effect
of
the
moving
pictures
themselves
we
must
concentrate
our
inquiry
on
the
moving
pictures
as
such
and
not
on
that
which
the
playwright
does
for
the
interpretation
of
the
pictures
it
may
be
granted
that
the
letters
and
newspaper
articles
take
a
middle
place
they
are
a
part
of
the
picture
but
their
influence
on
the
spectator
is
nevertheless
very
similar
to
that
of
the
leaders
we
are
here
concerned
only
with
what
the
pictorial
offering
contains
we
must
therefore
also
disregard
the
accompanying
music
or
the
imitative
noises
which
belong
to
the
technique
of
the
photoplay
nowadays
they
do
not
a
little
to
push
the
attention
hither
and
thither
yet
they
are
accessory
while
the
primary
power
must
lie
in
the
content
of
the
pictures
themselves
but
it
is
evident
that
with
the
exception
of
the
words
no
means
for
drawing
attention
which
is
effective
on
the
theater
stage
is
lost
in
the
photoplay
all
the
directing
influences
which
the
movements
of
the
actors
exert
can
be
felt
no
less
when
they
are
pictured
in
the
films
more
than
that
the
absence
of
the
words
brings
the
movements
which
we
see
to
still
greater
prominence
in
our
mind
our
whole
attention
can
now
be
focused
on
the
play
of
the
face
and
of
the
hands
every
gesture
and
every
mimic
excitement
stirs
us
now
much
more
than
if
it
were
only
the
accompaniment
of
speech
moreover
the
technical
conditions
of
the
kinematograph
show
favor
the
importance
of
the
movement
first
the
play
on
the
screen
is
acted
more
rapidly
than
that
on
the
stage
by
the
absence
of
speech
everything
is
condensed
the
whole
rhythm
is
quickened
a
greater
pressure
of
time
is
applied
and
through
that
the
accents
become
sharper
and
the
emphasis
more
powerful
for
the
attention
but
secondly
the
form
of
the
stage
intensifies
the
impression
made
by
those
who
move
toward
the
foreground
the
theater
stage
is
broadest
near
the
footlights
and
becomes
narrower
toward
the
background
the
moving
picture
stage
is
narrowest
in
front
and
becomes
wider
toward
the
background
this
is
necessary
because
its
width
is
controlled
by
the
angle
at
which
the
camera
takes
the
picture
the
camera
is
the
apex
of
an
angle
which
encloses
a
breadth
of
only
a
few
feet
in
the
nearest
photographic
distance
while
it
may
include
a
width
of
miles
in
the
far
distant
landscape
whatever
comes
to
the
foreground
therefore
gains
strongly
in
relative
importance
over
its
surroundings
moving
away
from
the
camera
means
a
reduction
much
greater
than
a
mere
stepping
to
the
background
on
the
theater
stage
furthermore
lifeless
things
have
much
more
chance
for
movements
in
the
moving
pictures
than
on
the
stage
and
their
motions
too
can
contribute
toward
the
right
setting
of
the
attention
but
we
know
from
the
theater
that
movement
is
not
the
only
condition
which
makes
us
focus
our
interest
on
a
particular
element
of
the
play
an
unusual
face
a
queer
dress
a
gorgeous
costume
or
a
surprising
lack
of
costume
a
quaint
piece
of
decoration
may
attract
our
mind
and
even
hold
it
spellbound
for
a
while
such
means
can
not
only
be
used
but
can
be
carried
to
a
much
stronger
climax
of
efficiency
by
the
unlimited
means
of
the
moving
pictures
this
is
still
more
true
of
the
power
of
setting
or
background
the
painted
landscape
of
the
stage
can
hardly
compete
with
the
wonders
of
nature
and
culture
when
the
scene
of
the
photoplay
is
laid
in
the
supreme
landscapes
of
the
world
wide
vistas
are
opened
the
woods
and
the
streams
the
mountain
valleys
and
the
ocean
are
before
us
with
the
whole
strength
of
reality
and
yet
in
rapid
change
which
does
not
allow
the
attention
to
become
fatigued
finally
the
mere
formal
arrangement
of
the
succeeding
pictures
may
keep
our
attention
in
control
and
here
again
are
possibilities
which
are
superior
to
those
of
the
solid
theater
stage
at
the
theater
no
effect
of
formal
arrangement
can
give
exactly
the
same
impression
to
the
spectators
in
every
part
of
the
house
the
perspective
of
the
wings
and
the
other
settings
and
their
relation
to
the
persons
and
to
the
background
can
never
appear
alike
from
the
front
and
from
the
rear
from
the
left
and
from
the
right
side
from
the
orchestra
and
from
the
balcony
while
the
picture
which
the
camera
has
fixated
is
the
same
from
every
corner
of
the
picture
palace
the
greatest
skill
and
refinement
can
be
applied
to
make
the
composition
serviceable
to
the
needs
of
attention
the
spectator
may
not
and
ought
not
to
be
aware
that
the
lines
of
the
background
the
hangings
of
the
room
the
curves
of
the
furniture
the
branches
of
the
trees
the
forms
of
the
mountains
help
to
point
toward
the
figure
of
the
woman
who
is
to
hold
his
mind
the
shading
of
the
lights
the
patches
of
dark
shadows
the
vagueness
of
some
parts
the
sharp
outlines
of
others
the
quietness
of
some
parts
of
the
picture
as
against
the
vehement
movement
of
others
all
play
on
the
keyboard
of
our
mind
and
secure
the
desired
effect
on
our
involuntary
attention
but
if
all
is
admitted
we
still
have
not
touched
on
the
most
important
and
most
characteristic
relation
of
the
photoplay
pictures
to
the
attention
of
the
audience
and
here
we
reach
a
sphere
in
which
any
comparison
with
the
stage
of
the
theater
would
be
in
vain
what
is
attention
what
are
the
essential
processes
in
the
mind
when
we
turn
our
attention
to
one
face
in
the
crowd
to
one
little
flower
in
the
wide
landscape
it
would
be
wrong
to
describe
the
process
in
the
mind
by
reference
to
one
change
alone
if
we
have
to
give
an
account
of
the
act
of
attention
as
seen
by
the
modern
psychologist
we
ought
to
point
to
several
coördinated
features
they
are
not
independent
of
one
another
but
are
closely
interrelated
we
may
say
that
whatever
attracts
our
attention
in
the
sphere
of
any
sense
sight
or
sound
touch
or
smell
surely
becomes
more
vivid
and
more
clear
in
our
consciousness
this
does
not
at
all
mean
that
it
becomes
more
intense
a
faint
light
to
which
we
turn
our
attention
does
not
become
the
strong
light
of
an
incandescent
lamp
no
it
remains
the
faint
just
perceptible
streak
of
lightness
but
it
has
grown
more
impressive
more
distinct
more
clear
in
its
details
more
vivid
it
has
taken
a
stronger
hold
of
us
or
as
we
may
say
by
a
metaphor
it
has
come
into
the
center
of
our
consciousness
but
this
involves
a
second
aspect
which
is
surely
no
less
important
while
the
attended
impression
becomes
more
vivid
all
the
other
impressions
become
less
vivid
less
clear
less
distinct
less
detailed
they
fade
away
we
no
longer
notice
them
they
have
no
hold
on
our
mind
they
disappear
if
we
are
fully
absorbed
in
our
book
we
do
not
hear
at
all
what
is
said
around
us
and
we
do
not
see
the
room
we
forget
everything
our
attention
to
the
page
of
the
book
brings
with
it
our
lack
of
attention
to
everything
else
we
may
add
a
third
factor
we
feel
that
our
body
adjusts
itself
to
the
perception
our
head
enters
into
the
movement
of
listening
for
the
sound
our
eyes
are
fixating
the
point
in
the
outer
world
we
hold
all
our
muscles
in
tension
in
order
to
receive
the
fullest
possible
impression
with
our
sense
organs
the
lens
in
our
eye
is
accommodated
exactly
to
the
correct
distance
in
short
our
bodily
personality
works
toward
the
fullest
possible
impression
but
this
is
supplemented
by
a
fourth
factor
our
ideas
and
feelings
and
impulses
group
themselves
around
the
attended
object
it
becomes
the
starting
point
for
our
actions
while
all
the
other
objects
in
the
sphere
of
our
senses
lose
their
grip
on
our
ideas
and
feelings
these
four
factors
are
intimately
related
to
one
another
as
we
are
passing
along
the
street
we
see
something
in
the
shop
window
and
as
soon
as
it
stirs
up
our
interest
our
body
adjusts
itself
we
stop
we
fixate
it
we
get
more
of
the
detail
in
it
the
lines
become
sharper
and
while
it
impresses
us
more
vividly
than
before
the
street
around
us
has
lost
its
vividness
and
clearness
if
on
the
stage
the
hand
movements
of
the
actor
catch
our
interest
we
no
longer
look
at
the
whole
large
scene
we
see
only
the
fingers
of
the
hero
clutching
the
revolver
with
which
he
is
to
commit
his
crime
our
attention
is
entirely
given
up
to
the
passionate
play
of
his
hand
it
becomes
the
central
point
for
all
our
emotional
responses
we
do
not
see
the
hands
of
any
other
actor
in
the
scene
everything
else
sinks
into
a
general
vague
background
while
that
one
hand
shows
more
and
more
details
the
more
we
fixate
it
the
more
its
clearness
and
distinctness
increase
from
this
one
point
wells
our
emotion
and
our
emotion
again
concentrates
our
senses
on
this
one
point
it
is
as
if
this
one
hand
were
during
this
pulse
beat
of
events
the
whole
scene
and
everything
else
had
faded
away
on
the
stage
this
is
impossible
there
nothing
can
really
fade
away
that
dramatic
hand
must
remain
after
all
only
the
ten
thousandth
part
of
the
space
of
the
whole
stage
it
must
remain
a
little
detail
the
whole
body
of
the
hero
and
the
other
men
and
the
whole
room
and
every
indifferent
chair
and
table
in
it
must
go
on
obtruding
themselves
on
our
senses
what
we
do
not
attend
can
not
be
suddenly
removed
from
the
stage
every
change
which
is
needed
must
be
secured
by
our
own
mind
in
our
consciousness
the
attended
hand
must
grow
and
the
surrounding
room
must
blur
but
the
stage
can
not
help
us
the
art
of
the
theater
has
there
its
limits
here
begins
the
art
of
the
photoplay
that
one
nervous
hand
which
feverishly
grasps
the
deadly
weapon
can
suddenly
for
the
space
of
a
breath
or
two
become
enlarged
and
be
alone
visible
on
the
screen
while
everything
else
has
really
faded
into
darkness
the
act
of
attention
which
goes
on
in
our
mind
has
remodeled
the
surrounding
itself
the
detail
which
is
being
watched
has
suddenly
become
the
whole
content
of
the
performance
and
everything
which
our
mind
wants
to
disregard
has
been
suddenly
banished
from
our
sight
and
has
disappeared
the
events
without
have
become
obedient
to
the
demands
of
our
consciousness
in
the
language
of
the
photoplay
producers
it
is
a
has
objectified
in
our
world
of
perception
our
mental
act
of
attention
and
by
it
has
furnished
art
with
a
means
which
far
transcends
the
power
of
any
theater
the
scheme
of
the
was
introduced
into
the
technique
of
the
film
play
rather
late
but
it
has
quickly
gained
a
secure
position
the
more
elaborate
the
production
the
more
frequent
and
the
more
skillful
the
use
of
this
new
and
artistic
means
the
melodrama
can
hardly
be
played
without
it
unless
a
most
inartistic
use
of
printed
words
is
made
the
has
to
furnish
the
explanations
if
a
little
locket
is
hung
on
the
neck
of
the
stolen
or
exchanged
infant
it
is
not
necessary
to
tell
us
in
words
that
everything
will
hinge
on
this
locket
twenty
years
later
when
the
girl
is
grown
up
if
the
ornament
at
the
child
throat
is
at
once
shown
in
a
where
everything
has
disappeared
and
only
its
quaint
form
appears
much
enlarged
on
the
screen
we
fix
it
in
our
imagination
and
know
that
we
must
give
our
fullest
attention
to
it
as
it
will
play
a
decisive
part
in
the
next
reel
the
gentleman
criminal
who
draws
his
handkerchief
from
his
pocket
and
with
it
a
little
bit
of
paper
which
falls
down
on
the
rug
unnoticed
by
him
has
no
power
to
draw
our
attention
to
that
incriminating
scrap
the
device
hardly
belongs
in
the
theater
because
the
audience
would
not
notice
it
any
more
than
would
the
scoundrel
himself
it
would
not
be
able
to
draw
the
attention
but
in
the
film
it
is
a
favorite
trick
at
the
moment
the
bit
of
paper
falls
we
see
it
greatly
enlarged
on
the
rug
while
everything
else
has
faded
away
and
we
read
on
it
that
it
is
a
ticket
from
the
railway
station
at
which
the
great
crime
was
committed
our
attention
is
focused
on
it
and
we
know
that
it
will
be
decisive
for
the
development
of
the
action
a
clerk
buys
a
newspaper
on
the
street
glances
at
it
and
is
shocked
suddenly
we
see
that
piece
of
news
with
our
own
eyes
the
magnifies
the
headlines
of
the
paper
so
that
they
fill
the
whole
screen
but
it
is
not
necessary
that
this
focusing
of
the
attention
should
refer
to
levers
in
the
plot
any
subtle
detail
any
significant
gesture
which
heightens
the
meaning
of
the
action
may
enter
into
the
center
of
our
consciousness
by
monopolizing
the
stage
for
a
few
seconds
there
is
love
in
her
smiling
face
and
yet
we
overlook
it
as
they
stand
in
a
crowded
room
but
suddenly
only
for
three
seconds
all
the
others
in
the
room
have
disappeared
the
bodies
of
the
lovers
themselves
have
faded
away
and
only
his
look
of
longing
and
her
smile
of
yielding
reach
out
to
us
the
has
done
what
no
theater
could
have
offered
by
its
own
means
though
we
might
have
approached
the
effect
in
the
theater
performance
if
we
had
taken
our
opera
glass
and
had
directed
it
only
to
those
two
heads
but
by
doing
so
we
should
have
emancipated
ourselves
from
the
offering
of
the
stage
picture
that
is
the
concentration
and
focusing
were
secured
by
us
and
not
by
the
performance
in
the
photoplay
it
is
the
opposite
have
we
not
reached
by
this
analysis
of
the
a
point
very
near
to
that
to
which
the
study
of
depth
perception
and
movement
perception
was
leading
we
saw
that
the
moving
pictures
give
us
the
plastic
world
and
the
moving
world
and
that
nevertheless
the
depth
and
the
motion
in
it
are
not
real
unlike
the
depth
and
motion
of
the
stage
we
find
now
that
the
reality
of
the
action
in
the
photoplay
in
still
another
respect
lacks
objective
independence
because
it
yields
to
our
subjective
play
of
attention
wherever
our
attention
becomes
focused
on
a
special
feature
the
surrounding
adjusts
itself
eliminates
everything
in
which
we
are
not
interested
and
by
the
heightens
the
vividness
of
that
on
which
our
mind
is
concentrated
it
is
as
if
that
outer
world
were
woven
into
our
mind
and
were
shaped
not
through
its
own
laws
but
by
the
acts
of
our
attention
chapter
v
memory
and
imagination
when
we
sit
in
a
real
theater
and
see
the
stage
with
its
depth
and
watch
the
actors
moving
and
turn
our
attention
hither
and
thither
we
feel
that
those
impressions
from
behind
the
footlights
have
objective
character
while
the
action
of
our
attention
is
subjective
those
men
and
things
come
from
without
but
the
play
of
the
attention
starts
from
within
yet
our
attention
as
we
have
seen
does
not
really
add
anything
to
the
impressions
of
the
stage
it
makes
some
more
vivid
and
clear
while
others
become
vague
or
fade
away
but
through
the
attention
alone
no
content
enters
our
consciousness
wherever
our
attention
may
wander
on
the
stage
whatever
we
experience
comes
to
us
through
the
channels
of
our
senses
the
spectator
in
the
audience
however
does
experience
more
than
merely
the
light
and
sound
sensations
which
fall
on
the
eye
and
ear
at
that
moment
he
may
be
entirely
fascinated
by
the
actions
on
the
stage
and
yet
his
mind
may
be
overflooded
with
other
ideas
only
one
of
their
sources
but
not
the
least
important
one
is
the
memory
indeed
the
action
of
the
memory
brings
to
the
mind
of
the
audience
ever
so
much
which
gives
fuller
meaning
and
ampler
setting
to
every
scene
yes
to
every
word
and
movement
on
the
stage
to
think
of
the
most
trivial
case
at
every
point
of
the
drama
we
must
remember
what
happened
in
the
previous
scenes
the
first
act
is
no
longer
on
the
stage
when
we
see
the
second
the
second
alone
is
now
our
sense
impression
yet
this
second
act
is
in
itself
meaningless
if
it
is
not
supported
by
the
first
hence
the
first
must
somehow
be
in
our
consciousness
at
least
in
every
important
scene
we
must
remember
those
situations
of
the
preceding
act
which
can
throw
light
on
the
new
developments
we
see
the
young
missionary
in
his
adventures
on
his
perilous
journey
and
we
remember
how
in
the
preceding
act
we
saw
him
in
his
peaceful
cottage
surrounded
by
the
love
of
his
parents
and
sisters
and
how
they
mourned
when
he
left
them
behind
the
more
exciting
the
dangers
he
passes
through
in
the
far
distant
land
the
more
strongly
does
our
memory
carry
us
back
to
the
home
scenes
which
we
witnessed
before
the
theater
can
not
do
more
than
suggest
to
our
memory
this
looking
backward
the
young
hero
may
call
this
reminiscence
back
to
our
consciousness
by
his
speech
and
his
prayer
and
when
he
fights
his
way
through
the
jungles
of
africa
and
the
savages
attack
him
the
melodrama
may
put
words
into
his
mouth
which
force
us
to
think
fervently
of
those
whom
he
has
left
behind
but
after
all
it
is
our
own
material
of
memory
ideas
which
supplies
the
picture
the
theater
can
not
go
further
the
photoplay
can
we
see
the
jungle
we
see
the
hero
at
the
height
of
his
danger
and
suddenly
there
flashes
upon
the
screen
a
picture
of
the
past
for
not
more
than
two
seconds
does
the
idyllic
new
england
scene
slip
into
the
exciting
african
events
when
one
deep
breath
is
over
we
are
stirred
again
by
the
event
of
the
present
that
home
scene
of
the
past
flitted
by
just
as
a
hasty
thought
of
bygone
days
darts
through
the
mind
the
modern
photoartist
makes
use
of
this
technical
device
in
an
abundance
of
forms
in
his
slang
any
going
back
to
an
earlier
scene
is
called
a
the
may
have
many
variations
and
serve
many
purposes
but
the
one
which
we
face
here
is
psychologically
the
most
interesting
we
have
really
an
objectivation
of
our
memory
function
the
case
of
the
is
there
quite
parallel
to
that
of
the
in
the
one
we
recognize
the
mental
act
of
attending
in
the
other
we
must
recognize
the
mental
act
of
remembering
both
cases
the
act
which
in
the
ordinary
theater
would
go
on
in
our
mind
alone
is
here
in
the
photoplay
projected
into
the
pictures
themselves
it
is
as
if
reality
has
lost
its
own
continuous
connection
and
become
shaped
by
the
demands
of
our
it
is
as
if
the
outer
world
itself
became
molded
in
accordance
with
our
fleeting
turns
of
attention
or
with
our
passing
memory
ideas
it
is
only
another
version
of
the
same
principle
when
the
course
of
events
is
interrupted
by
forward
glances
the
mental
function
involved
is
that
of
expectation
or
when
the
expectation
is
controlled
by
our
feelings
we
may
class
it
under
the
mental
function
of
imagination
the
melodrama
shows
us
how
the
young
millionaire
wastes
his
nights
in
a
dissipated
life
and
when
he
drinks
his
blasphemous
toast
at
a
champagne
feast
with
shameless
women
we
suddenly
see
on
the
screen
the
vision
of
twenty
years
later
when
the
bartender
of
a
most
miserable
saloon
pushes
the
penniless
tramp
out
into
the
gutter
the
last
act
in
the
theater
may
bring
us
to
such
an
ending
but
there
it
can
come
only
in
the
regular
succession
of
events
that
pitiful
ending
can
not
be
shown
to
us
when
life
is
still
blooming
and
when
a
twenty
years
downward
course
is
still
to
be
interpreted
there
only
our
own
imagination
can
anticipate
how
the
mill
of
life
may
grind
in
the
photoplay
our
imagination
is
projected
on
the
screen
with
an
uncanny
contrast
that
ultimate
picture
of
defeat
breaks
in
where
victory
seems
most
glorious
and
five
seconds
later
the
story
of
youth
and
rapture
streams
on
again
we
see
the
course
of
the
natural
events
remolded
by
the
power
of
the
mind
the
theater
can
picture
only
how
the
real
occurrences
might
follow
one
another
the
photoplay
can
overcome
the
interval
of
the
future
as
well
as
the
interval
of
the
past
and
slip
the
day
twenty
years
hence
between
this
minute
and
the
next
in
short
it
can
act
as
our
imagination
acts
it
has
the
mobility
of
our
ideas
which
are
not
controlled
by
the
physical
necessity
of
outer
events
but
by
the
psychological
laws
for
the
association
of
ideas
in
our
mind
past
and
future
become
intertwined
with
the
present
the
photoplay
obeys
the
laws
of
the
mind
rather
than
those
of
the
outer
world
but
the
play
of
memory
and
imagination
can
have
a
still
richer
significance
in
the
art
of
the
film
the
screen
may
produce
not
only
what
we
remember
or
imagine
but
what
the
persons
in
the
play
see
in
their
own
minds
the
technique
of
the
camera
stage
has
successfully
introduced
a
distinct
form
for
this
kind
of
picturing
if
a
person
in
the
scene
remembers
the
past
a
past
which
may
be
entirely
unknown
to
the
spectator
but
which
is
living
in
the
memory
of
the
hero
or
heroine
then
the
former
events
are
not
thrown
on
the
screen
as
an
entirely
new
set
of
pictures
but
they
are
connected
with
the
present
scene
by
a
slow
transition
he
sits
at
the
fireplace
in
his
study
and
receives
the
letter
with
the
news
of
her
wedding
the
picture
which
shows
us
the
enlargement
of
the
engraved
wedding
announcement
appears
as
an
entirely
new
picture
the
room
suddenly
disappears
and
the
hand
which
holds
the
card
flashes
up
again
when
we
have
read
the
card
it
suddenly
disappears
and
we
are
in
the
room
again
but
when
he
has
dreamily
stirred
the
fire
and
sits
down
and
gazes
into
the
flames
then
the
room
seems
to
dissolve
the
lines
blur
the
details
fade
away
and
while
the
walls
and
the
whole
room
slowly
melt
with
the
same
slow
transition
the
flower
garden
blossoms
out
the
flower
garden
where
he
and
she
sat
together
under
the
lilac
bush
and
he
confessed
to
her
his
boyish
love
and
then
the
garden
slowly
vanishes
and
through
the
flowers
we
see
once
more
the
dim
outlines
of
the
room
and
they
become
sharper
and
sharper
until
we
are
in
the
midst
of
the
study
again
and
nothing
is
left
of
the
vision
of
the
past
the
technique
of
manufacturing
such
gradual
transitions
from
one
picture
into
another
and
back
again
demands
much
patience
and
is
more
difficult
than
the
sudden
change
as
two
exactly
corresponding
sets
of
views
have
to
be
produced
and
finally
combined
but
this
cumbersome
method
has
been
fully
accepted
in
moving
picture
making
and
the
effect
indeed
somewhat
symbolizes
the
appearance
and
disappearance
of
a
reminiscence
this
scheme
naturally
opens
wide
perspectives
the
skilful
photoplaywright
can
communicate
to
us
long
scenes
and
complicated
developments
of
the
past
in
the
form
of
such
retrospective
pictures
the
man
who
shot
his
best
friend
has
not
offered
an
explanation
in
the
court
trial
which
we
witness
it
remains
a
perfect
secret
to
the
town
and
a
mystery
to
the
spectator
and
now
as
the
jail
door
closes
behind
him
the
walls
of
the
prison
fuse
and
melt
away
and
we
witness
the
scene
in
the
little
cottage
where
his
friend
secretly
met
his
wife
and
how
he
broke
in
and
how
it
all
came
about
and
how
he
rejected
every
excuse
which
would
dishonor
his
home
the
whole
murder
story
becomes
embedded
in
the
reappearance
of
his
memory
ideas
the
effect
is
much
less
artistic
when
the
photoplay
as
not
seldom
happens
uses
this
pattern
as
a
mere
substitute
for
words
in
the
picturization
of
a
gaboriau
story
the
woman
declines
to
tell
before
the
court
her
life
story
which
ended
in
a
crime
she
finally
yields
she
begins
under
oath
to
describe
her
whole
past
and
at
the
moment
when
she
opens
her
mouth
the
courtroom
disappears
and
fades
into
the
scene
in
which
the
love
adventure
began
then
we
pass
through
a
long
set
of
scenes
which
lead
to
the
critical
point
and
at
that
moment
we
slide
back
into
the
courtroom
and
the
woman
finishes
her
confession
that
is
an
external
substitution
of
the
pictures
for
the
words
esthetically
on
a
much
lower
level
than
the
other
case
where
the
past
was
living
only
in
the
memory
of
the
witness
yet
it
is
again
an
embodiment
of
past
events
which
the
genuine
theater
could
offer
to
the
ear
but
never
to
the
eye
just
as
we
can
follow
the
reminiscences
of
the
hero
we
may
share
the
fancies
of
his
imagination
once
more
the
case
is
distinctly
different
from
the
one
in
which
we
the
spectators
had
our
imaginative
ideas
realized
on
the
screen
here
we
are
passive
witnesses
to
the
wonders
which
are
unveiled
through
the
imagination
of
the
persons
in
the
play
we
see
the
boy
who
is
to
enter
the
navy
and
who
sleeps
on
shipboard
the
first
night
the
walls
disappear
and
his
imagination
flutters
from
port
to
port
all
he
has
seen
in
the
pictures
of
foreign
lands
and
has
heard
from
his
comrades
becomes
the
background
of
his
jubilant
adventures
now
he
stands
in
the
rigging
while
the
proud
vessel
sails
into
the
harbor
of
rio
de
janeiro
and
now
into
manila
bay
now
he
enjoys
himself
in
japanese
ports
and
now
by
the
shores
of
india
now
he
glides
through
the
suez
canal
and
now
he
returns
to
the
skyscrapers
of
new
york
not
more
than
one
minute
was
needed
for
his
world
travel
in
beautiful
fantastic
pictures
and
yet
we
lived
through
all
the
boy
hopes
and
ecstasies
with
him
if
we
had
seen
the
young
sailor
in
his
hammock
on
the
theater
stage
he
might
have
hinted
to
us
whatever
passed
through
his
mind
by
a
kind
of
monologue
or
by
some
enthusiastic
speech
to
a
friend
but
then
we
should
have
seen
before
our
inner
eye
only
that
which
the
names
of
foreign
places
awake
in
ourselves
we
should
not
really
have
seen
the
wonders
of
the
world
through
the
eyes
of
his
soul
and
with
the
glow
of
his
hope
the
drama
would
have
given
dead
names
to
our
ear
the
photoplay
gives
ravishing
scenery
to
our
eye
and
shows
the
fancy
of
the
young
fellow
in
the
scene
really
living
from
here
we
see
the
perspective
to
the
fantastic
dreams
which
the
camera
can
fixate
whenever
the
theater
introduces
an
imagined
setting
and
the
stage
clouds
sink
over
the
sleeper
and
the
angels
fill
the
stage
the
beauty
of
the
verses
must
excuse
the
shortcomings
of
the
visual
appeal
the
photoplay
artist
can
gain
his
triumphs
here
even
the
vulgar
effects
become
softened
by
this
setting
the
ragged
tramp
who
climbs
a
tree
and
falls
asleep
in
the
shady
branches
and
then
lives
through
a
reversed
world
in
which
he
and
his
kind
feast
and
glory
and
live
in
palaces
and
sail
in
yachts
and
when
the
boiler
of
the
yacht
explodes
falls
from
the
tree
to
the
ground
becomes
a
tolerable
spectacle
because
all
is
merged
in
the
unreal
pictures
or
to
think
of
the
other
extreme
gigantic
visions
of
mankind
crushed
by
the
juggernaut
of
war
and
then
blessed
by
the
angel
of
peace
may
arise
before
our
eyes
with
all
their
spiritual
meaning
even
the
whole
play
may
find
its
frame
in
a
setting
which
offers
a
performance
as
one
great
imaginative
dream
in
the
pretty
play
when
broadway
was
a
trail
the
hero
and
heroine
stand
on
the
metropolitan
tower
and
bend
over
its
railing
they
see
the
turmoil
of
new
york
of
the
present
day
and
ships
passing
the
statue
of
liberty
he
begins
to
tell
her
of
the
past
when
in
the
seventeenth
century
broadway
was
a
trail
and
suddenly
the
time
which
his
imagination
awakens
is
with
us
through
two
hours
we
follow
the
happenings
of
three
hundred
years
ago
from
new
amsterdam
it
leads
to
the
new
england
shores
all
the
early
colonial
life
shows
us
its
intimate
charm
and
when
the
hero
has
found
his
way
back
over
the
broadway
trail
we
awake
and
see
the
last
gestures
with
which
the
young
narrator
shows
to
the
girl
the
broadway
buildings
of
today
memory
looks
toward
the
past
expectation
and
imagination
toward
the
future
but
in
the
midst
of
the
perception
of
our
surroundings
our
mind
turns
not
only
to
that
which
has
happened
before
and
which
may
happen
later
it
is
interested
in
happenings
at
the
same
time
in
other
places
the
theater
can
show
us
only
the
events
at
one
spot
our
mind
craves
more
life
does
not
move
forward
on
one
single
pathway
the
whole
manifoldness
of
parallel
currents
with
their
endless
interconnections
is
the
true
substance
of
our
understanding
it
may
be
the
task
of
a
particular
art
to
force
all
into
one
steady
development
between
the
walls
of
one
room
but
every
letter
and
every
telephone
call
to
the
room
remind
us
even
then
that
other
developments
with
other
settings
are
proceeding
in
the
same
instant
the
soul
longs
for
this
whole
interplay
and
the
richer
it
is
in
contrasts
the
more
satisfaction
may
be
drawn
from
our
simultaneous
presence
in
many
quarters
the
photoplay
alone
gives
us
our
chance
for
such
omnipresence
we
see
the
banker
who
had
told
his
young
wife
that
he
has
a
directors
meeting
at
a
late
hour
in
a
cabaret
feasting
with
a
stenographer
from
his
office
she
had
promised
her
poor
old
parents
to
be
home
early
we
see
the
gorgeous
roof
garden
and
the
tango
dances
but
our
dramatic
interest
is
divided
among
the
frivolous
pair
the
jealous
young
woman
in
the
suburban
cottage
and
the
anxious
old
people
in
the
attic
our
mind
wavers
among
the
three
scenes
the
photoplay
shows
one
after
another
yet
it
can
hardly
be
said
that
we
think
of
them
as
successive
it
is
as
if
we
were
really
at
all
three
places
at
once
we
see
the
joyous
dance
which
is
of
central
dramatic
interest
for
twenty
seconds
then
for
three
seconds
the
wife
in
her
luxurious
boudoir
looking
at
the
dial
of
the
clock
for
three
seconds
again
the
grieved
parents
eagerly
listening
for
any
sound
on
the
stairs
and
anew
for
twenty
seconds
the
turbulent
festival
the
frenzy
reaches
a
climax
and
in
that
moment
we
are
suddenly
again
with
his
unhappy
wife
it
is
only
a
flash
and
the
next
instant
we
see
the
tears
of
the
poor
mother
the
three
scenes
proceed
almost
as
if
no
one
were
interrupted
at
all
it
is
as
if
we
saw
one
through
another
as
if
three
tones
blended
into
one
chord
there
is
no
limit
to
the
number
of
threads
which
may
be
interwoven
a
complex
intrigue
may
demand
coöperation
at
half
a
dozen
spots
and
we
look
now
into
one
now
into
another
and
never
have
the
impression
that
they
come
one
after
another
the
temporal
element
has
disappeared
the
one
action
irradiates
in
all
directions
of
course
this
can
easily
be
exaggerated
and
the
result
must
be
a
certain
restlessness
if
the
scene
changes
too
often
and
no
movement
is
carried
on
without
a
break
the
play
may
irritate
us
by
its
nervous
jerking
from
place
to
place
near
the
end
of
the
theda
bara
edition
of
carmen
the
scene
changes
one
hundred
and
seventy
times
in
ten
minutes
an
average
of
a
little
more
than
three
seconds
for
each
scene
we
follow
don
jose
and
carmen
and
the
toreador
in
ever
new
phases
of
the
dramatic
action
and
are
constantly
carried
back
to
don
jose
home
village
where
his
mother
waits
for
him
there
indeed
the
dramatic
tension
has
an
element
of
nervousness
in
contrast
to
the
geraldine
farrar
version
of
carmen
which
allows
a
more
unbroken
development
of
the
single
action
but
whether
it
is
used
with
artistic
reserve
or
with
a
certain
dangerous
exaggeration
in
any
case
its
psychological
meaning
is
obvious
it
demonstrates
to
us
in
a
new
form
the
same
principle
which
the
perception
of
depth
and
of
movement
the
acts
of
attention
and
of
memory
and
of
imagination
have
shown
objective
world
is
molded
by
the
interests
of
the
mind
events
which
are
far
distant
from
one
another
so
that
we
could
not
be
physically
present
at
all
of
them
at
the
same
time
are
fusing
in
our
field
of
vision
just
as
they
are
brought
together
in
our
own
psychologists
are
still
debating
whether
the
mind
can
ever
devote
itself
to
several
groups
of
ideas
at
the
same
time
some
claim
that
any
division
of
attention
is
really
a
rapid
alteration
yet
in
any
case
subjectively
we
experience
it
as
an
actual
division
our
mind
is
split
and
can
be
here
and
there
apparently
in
one
mental
act
this
inner
division
this
awareness
of
contrasting
situations
this
interchange
of
diverging
experiences
in
the
soul
can
never
be
embodied
except
in
the
photoplay
an
interesting
side
light
falls
on
this
relation
between
the
mind
and
the
pictured
scenes
if
we
turn
to
a
mental
process
which
is
quite
nearly
related
to
those
which
we
have
considered
namely
suggestion
it
is
similar
in
that
a
suggested
idea
which
awakes
in
our
consciousness
is
built
up
from
the
same
material
as
the
memory
ideas
or
the
imaginative
ideas
the
play
of
associations
controls
the
suggestions
as
it
does
the
reminiscences
and
fancies
yet
in
an
essential
point
it
is
quite
different
all
the
other
associative
ideas
find
merely
their
starting
point
in
those
outer
impressions
we
see
a
landscape
on
the
stage
or
on
the
screen
or
in
life
and
this
visual
perception
is
the
cue
which
stirs
up
in
our
memory
or
imagination
any
fitting
ideas
the
choice
of
them
however
is
completely
controlled
by
our
own
interest
and
attitude
and
by
our
previous
experiences
those
memories
and
fancies
are
therefore
felt
as
our
subjective
supplements
we
do
not
believe
in
their
objective
reality
a
suggestion
on
the
other
hand
is
forced
on
us
the
outer
perception
is
not
only
a
starting
point
but
a
controlling
influence
the
associated
idea
is
not
felt
as
our
creation
but
as
something
to
which
we
have
to
submit
the
extreme
case
is
of
course
that
of
the
hypnotizer
whose
word
awakens
in
the
mind
of
the
hypnotized
person
ideas
which
he
can
not
resist
he
must
accept
them
as
real
he
must
believe
that
the
dreary
room
is
a
beautiful
garden
in
which
he
picks
flowers
the
spellbound
audience
in
a
theater
or
in
a
picture
house
is
certainly
in
a
state
of
heightened
suggestibility
and
is
ready
to
receive
suggestions
one
great
and
fundamental
suggestion
is
working
in
both
cases
inasmuch
as
the
drama
as
well
as
the
photoplay
suggests
to
the
mind
of
the
spectator
that
this
is
more
than
mere
play
that
it
is
life
which
we
witness
but
if
we
go
further
and
ask
for
the
application
of
suggestions
in
the
detailed
action
we
can
not
overlook
the
fact
that
the
theater
is
extremely
limited
in
its
means
a
series
of
events
on
the
stage
may
strongly
force
on
the
mind
the
prediction
of
something
which
must
follow
but
inasmuch
as
the
stage
has
to
do
with
real
physical
beings
who
must
behave
according
to
the
laws
of
nature
it
can
not
avoid
offering
us
the
actual
events
for
which
we
were
waiting
to
be
sure
even
on
the
stage
the
hero
may
talk
the
revolver
in
his
hand
until
it
is
fully
suggested
to
us
that
the
suicidal
shot
will
end
his
life
in
the
next
instant
and
yet
just
then
the
curtain
may
fall
and
only
the
suggestion
of
his
death
may
work
in
our
mind
but
this
is
evidently
a
very
exceptional
case
as
a
fall
of
the
curtain
means
the
ending
of
the
scene
in
the
act
itself
every
series
of
events
must
come
to
its
natural
ending
if
two
men
begin
to
fight
on
the
stage
nothing
remains
to
be
suggested
we
must
simply
witness
the
fight
and
if
two
lovers
embrace
each
other
we
have
to
see
their
caresses
the
photoplay
can
not
only
cut
back
in
the
service
of
memories
but
it
can
cut
off
in
the
service
of
suggestion
even
if
the
police
did
not
demand
that
actual
crimes
and
suicides
should
never
be
shown
on
the
screen
for
mere
artistic
reasons
it
would
be
wiser
to
leave
the
climax
to
the
suggestion
to
which
the
whole
scene
has
led
there
is
no
need
of
bringing
the
series
of
pictures
to
its
logical
end
because
they
are
pictures
only
and
not
the
real
objects
at
any
instant
the
man
may
disappear
from
the
scene
and
no
automobile
can
race
over
the
ground
so
rapidly
that
it
can
not
be
stopped
just
as
it
is
to
crash
into
the
rushing
express
train
the
horseback
rider
jumps
into
the
abyss
we
see
him
fall
and
yet
at
the
moment
when
he
crashes
to
the
ground
we
are
already
in
the
midst
of
a
far
distant
scene
again
and
again
with
doubtful
taste
the
sensuality
of
the
nickel
audiences
has
been
stirred
up
by
suggestive
pictures
of
a
girl
undressing
and
when
in
the
intimate
chamber
the
last
garment
was
touched
the
spectators
were
suddenly
in
the
marketplace
among
crowds
of
people
or
in
a
sailing
vessel
on
the
river
the
whole
technique
of
the
rapid
changes
of
scenes
which
we
have
recognized
as
so
characteristic
of
the
photoplay
involves
at
every
end
point
elements
of
suggestion
which
to
a
certain
degree
link
the
separate
scenes
as
the
afterimages
link
the
separate
pictures
chapter
vi
emotions
to
picture
emotions
must
be
the
central
aim
of
the
photoplay
in
the
drama
words
of
wisdom
may
be
spoken
and
we
may
listen
to
the
conversations
with
interest
even
if
they
have
only
intellectual
and
not
emotional
character
but
the
actor
whom
we
see
on
the
screen
can
hold
our
attention
only
by
what
he
is
doing
and
his
actions
gain
meaning
and
unity
for
us
through
the
feelings
and
emotions
which
control
them
more
than
in
the
drama
the
persons
in
the
photoplay
are
to
us
first
of
all
subjects
of
emotional
experiences
their
joy
and
pain
their
hope
and
fear
their
love
and
hate
their
gratitude
and
envy
their
sympathy
and
malice
give
meaning
and
value
to
the
play
what
are
the
chances
of
the
photoartist
to
bring
these
feelings
to
a
convincing
expression
no
doubt
an
emotion
which
is
deprived
of
its
discharge
by
words
has
lost
a
strong
element
and
yet
gestures
actions
and
facial
play
are
so
interwoven
with
the
psychical
process
of
an
intense
emotion
that
every
shade
can
find
its
characteristic
delivery
the
face
alone
with
its
tensions
around
the
mouth
with
its
play
of
the
eye
with
its
cast
of
the
forehead
and
even
with
the
motions
of
the
nostrils
and
the
setting
of
the
jaw
may
bring
numberless
shades
into
the
feeling
tone
here
again
the
can
strongly
heighten
the
impression
it
is
at
the
climax
of
emotion
on
the
stage
that
the
theatergoer
likes
to
use
his
opera
glass
in
order
not
to
overlook
the
subtle
excitement
of
the
lips
and
the
passion
of
the
eyeballs
and
the
ghastly
pupil
and
the
quivering
cheeks
the
enlargement
by
the
on
the
screen
brings
this
emotional
action
of
the
face
to
sharpest
relief
or
it
may
show
us
enlarged
a
play
of
the
hands
in
which
anger
and
rage
or
tender
love
or
jealousy
speak
in
unmistakable
language
in
humorous
scenes
even
the
flirting
of
amorous
feet
may
in
the
tell
the
story
of
their
possessors
hearts
nevertheless
there
are
narrow
limits
many
emotional
symptoms
like
blushing
or
growing
pale
would
be
lost
in
the
mere
photographic
rendering
and
above
all
these
and
many
other
signs
of
feeling
are
not
under
voluntary
control
the
photoactors
may
carefully
go
through
the
movements
and
imitate
the
contractions
and
relaxations
of
the
muscles
and
yet
may
be
unable
to
produce
those
processes
which
are
most
essential
for
the
true
life
emotion
namely
those
in
the
glands
blood
vessels
and
involuntary
muscles
certainly
the
going
through
the
motions
will
shade
consciousness
sufficiently
so
that
some
of
these
involuntary
and
instinctive
responses
may
set
in
the
actor
really
experiences
something
of
the
inner
excitement
which
he
imitates
and
with
the
excitement
the
automatic
reactions
appear
yet
only
a
few
can
actually
shed
tears
however
much
they
move
the
muscles
of
the
face
into
the
semblance
of
crying
the
pupil
of
the
eye
is
somewhat
more
obedient
as
the
involuntary
muscles
of
the
iris
respond
to
the
cue
which
a
strong
imagination
can
give
and
the
mimic
presentation
of
terror
or
astonishment
or
hatred
may
actually
lead
to
the
enlargement
or
contraction
of
the
pupil
which
the
may
show
yet
there
remains
too
much
which
mere
art
can
not
render
and
which
life
alone
produces
because
the
consciousness
of
the
unreality
of
the
situation
works
as
a
psychological
inhibition
on
the
automatic
instinctive
responses
the
actor
may
artificially
tremble
or
breathe
heavily
but
the
strong
pulsation
of
the
carotid
artery
or
the
moistness
of
the
skin
from
perspiration
will
not
come
with
an
imitated
emotion
of
course
that
is
true
of
the
actor
on
the
stage
too
but
the
content
of
the
words
and
the
modulation
of
the
voice
can
help
so
much
that
the
shortcomings
of
the
visual
impression
are
forgotten
to
the
actor
of
the
moving
pictures
on
the
other
hand
the
temptation
offers
itself
to
overcome
the
deficiency
by
a
heightening
of
the
gestures
and
of
the
facial
play
with
the
result
that
the
emotional
expression
becomes
exaggerated
no
friend
of
the
photoplay
can
deny
that
much
of
the
photoart
suffers
from
this
almost
unavoidable
tendency
the
quick
marchlike
rhythm
of
the
drama
of
the
reel
favors
this
artificial
overdoing
too
the
rapid
alternation
of
the
scenes
often
seems
to
demand
a
jumping
from
one
emotional
climax
to
another
or
rather
the
appearance
of
such
extreme
expressions
where
the
content
of
the
play
hardly
suggests
such
heights
and
depths
of
emotion
the
soft
lights
are
lost
and
the
mental
eye
becomes
adjusted
to
glaring
flashes
this
undeniable
defect
is
felt
with
the
american
actors
still
more
than
with
the
european
especially
with
the
french
and
italian
ones
with
whom
excited
gestures
and
highly
accentuated
expressions
of
the
face
are
natural
a
new
england
temperament
forced
into
neapolitan
expressions
of
hatred
or
jealousy
or
adoration
too
easily
appears
a
caricature
it
is
not
by
chance
that
so
many
strong
actors
of
the
stage
are
such
more
or
less
decided
failures
on
the
screen
they
have
been
dragged
into
an
art
which
is
foreign
to
them
and
their
achievement
has
not
seldom
remained
far
below
that
of
the
specializing
photoactor
the
habitual
reliance
on
the
magic
of
the
voice
deprives
them
of
the
natural
means
of
expression
when
they
are
to
render
emotions
without
words
they
give
too
little
or
too
much
they
are
not
expressive
or
they
become
grotesque
of
course
the
photoartist
profits
from
one
advantage
he
is
not
obliged
to
find
the
most
expressive
gesture
in
one
decisive
moment
of
the
stage
performance
he
can
not
only
rehearse
but
he
can
repeat
the
scene
before
the
camera
until
exactly
the
right
inspiration
comes
and
the
manager
who
takes
the
visage
may
discard
many
a
poor
pose
before
he
strikes
that
one
expression
in
which
the
whole
content
of
the
feeling
of
the
scene
is
concentrated
in
one
other
respect
the
producer
of
the
photoplay
has
a
technical
advantage
more
easily
than
the
stage
manager
of
the
real
theater
he
can
choose
actors
whose
natural
build
and
physiognomy
fit
the
rôle
and
predispose
them
for
the
desired
expression
the
drama
depends
upon
professional
actors
the
photoplay
can
pick
players
among
any
group
of
people
for
specific
rôles
they
need
no
art
of
speaking
and
no
training
in
delivery
the
artificial
of
the
stage
actors
in
order
to
give
them
special
character
is
therefore
less
needed
for
the
screen
the
expression
of
the
faces
and
the
gestures
must
gain
through
such
natural
fitness
of
the
man
for
the
particular
rôle
if
the
photoplay
needs
a
brutal
boxer
in
a
mining
camp
the
producer
will
not
like
the
stage
manager
try
to
transform
a
clean
neat
professional
actor
into
a
vulgar
brute
but
he
will
sift
the
bowery
until
he
has
found
some
creature
who
looks
as
if
he
came
from
that
mining
camp
and
who
has
at
least
the
prizefighter
cauliflower
ear
which
results
from
the
smashing
of
the
ear
cartilage
if
he
needs
the
fat
bartender
with
his
smug
smile
or
the
humble
jewish
peddler
or
the
italian
organ
grinder
he
does
not
rely
on
wigs
and
paint
he
finds
them
all
on
the
east
side
with
the
right
body
and
countenance
the
emotion
is
distinctly
more
credible
the
emotional
expression
in
the
photoplays
is
therefore
often
more
natural
in
the
small
rôles
which
the
outsiders
play
than
in
the
chief
parts
of
the
professionals
who
feel
that
they
must
outdo
nature
but
our
whole
consideration
so
far
has
been
onesided
and
narrow
we
have
asked
only
about
the
means
by
which
the
photoactor
expresses
his
emotion
and
we
were
naturally
confined
to
the
analysis
of
his
bodily
reactions
but
while
the
human
individual
in
our
surroundings
has
hardly
any
other
means
than
the
bodily
expressions
to
show
his
emotions
and
moods
the
photoplaywright
is
certainly
not
bound
by
these
limits
yet
even
in
life
the
emotional
tone
may
radiate
beyond
the
body
a
person
expresses
his
mourning
by
his
black
clothes
and
his
joy
by
gay
attire
or
he
may
make
the
piano
or
violin
ring
forth
in
happiness
or
moan
in
sadness
even
his
whole
room
or
house
may
be
penetrated
by
his
spirit
of
welcoming
cordiality
or
his
emotional
setting
of
forbidding
harshness
the
feeling
of
the
soul
emanates
into
the
surroundings
and
the
impression
which
we
get
of
our
neighbor
emotional
attitude
may
be
derived
from
this
external
frame
of
the
personality
as
much
as
from
the
gestures
and
the
face
this
effect
of
the
surrounding
surely
can
and
must
be
much
heightened
in
the
artistic
theater
play
all
the
stage
settings
of
the
scene
ought
to
be
in
harmony
with
the
fundamental
emotions
of
the
play
and
many
an
act
owes
its
success
to
the
unity
of
emotional
impression
which
results
from
the
perfect
painting
of
the
background
it
reverberates
to
the
passions
of
the
mind
from
the
highest
artistic
color
and
form
effects
of
the
stage
in
the
reinhardt
style
down
to
the
cheapest
melodrama
with
soft
blue
lights
and
tender
music
for
the
closing
scene
the
stage
arrangements
tell
the
story
of
the
intimate
emotion
but
just
this
additional
expression
of
the
feeling
through
the
medium
of
the
surrounding
scene
through
background
and
setting
through
lines
and
forms
and
movements
is
very
much
more
at
the
disposal
of
the
photoartist
he
alone
can
change
the
background
and
all
the
surroundings
of
the
acting
person
from
instant
to
instant
he
is
not
bound
to
one
setting
he
has
no
technical
difficulty
in
altering
the
whole
scene
with
every
smile
and
every
frown
to
be
sure
the
theater
can
give
us
changing
sunshine
and
thunderclouds
too
but
it
must
go
on
at
the
slow
pace
and
with
the
clumsiness
with
which
the
events
in
nature
pass
the
photoplay
can
flit
from
one
to
the
other
not
more
than
one
sixteenth
of
a
second
is
needed
to
carry
us
from
one
corner
of
the
globe
to
the
other
from
a
jubilant
setting
to
a
mourning
scene
the
whole
keyboard
of
the
imagination
may
be
used
to
serve
this
emotionalizing
of
nature
there
is
a
girl
in
her
little
room
and
she
opens
a
letter
and
reads
it
there
is
no
need
of
showing
us
in
a
the
letter
page
with
the
male
handwriting
and
the
words
of
love
and
the
request
for
her
hand
we
see
it
in
her
radiant
visage
we
read
it
from
her
fascinated
arms
and
hands
and
yet
how
much
more
can
the
photoartist
tell
us
about
the
storm
of
emotions
in
her
soul
the
walls
of
her
little
room
fade
away
beautiful
hedges
of
hawthorn
blossom
around
her
rose
bushes
in
wonderful
glory
arise
and
the
whole
ground
is
alive
with
exotic
flowers
or
the
young
artist
sits
in
his
attic
playing
his
violin
we
see
the
bow
moving
over
the
strings
but
the
dreamy
face
of
the
player
does
not
change
with
his
music
under
the
spell
of
his
tones
his
features
are
immovable
as
if
they
were
staring
at
a
vision
they
do
not
speak
of
the
changing
emotions
which
his
melodies
awake
we
can
not
hear
those
tones
and
yet
we
do
hear
them
a
lovely
spring
landscape
widens
behind
his
head
we
see
the
valleys
of
may
and
the
bubbling
brooks
and
the
young
wild
beeches
and
slowly
it
changes
into
the
sadness
of
the
autumn
the
sere
leaves
are
falling
around
the
player
heavy
clouds
hang
low
over
his
head
suddenly
at
a
sharp
accent
of
his
bow
the
storm
breaks
we
are
carried
to
the
wildness
of
rugged
rocks
or
to
the
raging
sea
and
again
comes
tranquillity
over
the
world
the
little
country
village
of
his
youth
fills
the
background
the
harvest
is
brought
from
the
fields
the
sun
sets
upon
a
scene
of
happiness
and
while
the
bow
slowly
sinks
the
walls
and
ceiling
of
his
attic
close
in
again
no
shade
no
tint
no
hue
of
his
emotions
has
escaped
us
we
followed
them
as
if
we
had
heard
the
rejoicing
and
the
sadness
the
storm
and
the
peace
of
his
melodious
tones
such
imaginative
settings
can
be
only
the
extreme
they
would
not
be
fit
for
the
routine
play
but
however
much
weaker
and
fainter
the
echo
of
the
surroundings
may
be
in
the
realistic
pictures
of
the
standard
photoplay
the
chances
are
abundant
everywhere
and
no
skillful
playwright
will
ever
disregard
them
entirely
not
the
portrait
of
the
man
but
the
picture
as
a
whole
has
to
be
filled
with
emotional
exuberance
everything
so
far
has
referred
to
the
emotions
of
the
persons
in
the
play
but
this
can
not
be
sufficient
when
we
were
interested
in
attention
and
memory
we
did
not
ask
about
the
act
of
attention
and
memory
in
the
persons
of
the
play
but
in
the
spectator
and
we
recognized
that
these
mental
activities
and
excitements
in
the
audience
were
projected
into
the
moving
pictures
just
here
was
the
center
of
our
interest
because
it
showed
that
uniqueness
of
the
means
with
which
the
photoplaywright
can
work
if
we
want
to
shape
the
question
now
in
the
same
way
we
ought
to
ask
how
it
is
with
the
emotions
of
the
spectator
but
then
two
different
groups
of
cases
must
be
distinguished
on
the
one
side
we
have
those
emotions
in
which
the
feelings
of
the
persons
in
the
play
are
transmitted
to
our
own
soul
on
the
other
side
we
find
those
feelings
with
which
we
respond
to
the
scenes
in
the
play
feelings
which
may
be
entirely
different
perhaps
exactly
opposite
to
those
which
the
figures
in
the
play
express
the
first
group
is
by
far
the
larger
one
our
imitation
of
the
emotions
which
we
see
expressed
brings
vividness
and
affective
tone
into
our
grasping
of
the
play
action
we
sympathize
with
the
sufferer
and
that
means
that
the
pain
which
he
expresses
becomes
our
own
pain
we
share
the
joy
of
the
happy
lover
and
the
grief
of
the
despondent
mourner
we
feel
the
indignation
of
the
betrayed
wife
and
the
fear
of
the
man
in
danger
the
visual
perception
of
the
various
forms
of
expression
of
these
emotions
fuses
in
our
mind
with
the
conscious
awareness
of
the
emotion
expressed
we
feel
as
if
we
were
directly
seeing
and
observing
the
emotion
itself
moreover
the
idea
awakens
in
us
the
appropriate
reactions
the
horror
which
we
see
makes
us
really
shrink
the
happiness
which
we
witness
makes
us
relax
the
pain
which
we
observe
brings
contractions
in
our
muscles
and
all
the
resulting
sensations
from
muscles
joints
tendons
from
skin
and
viscera
from
blood
circulation
and
breathing
give
the
color
of
living
experience
to
the
emotional
reflection
in
our
mind
it
is
obvious
that
for
this
leading
group
of
emotions
the
relation
of
the
pictures
to
the
feelings
of
the
persons
in
the
play
and
to
the
feelings
of
the
spectator
is
exactly
the
same
if
we
start
from
the
emotions
of
the
audience
we
can
say
that
the
pain
and
the
joy
which
the
spectator
feels
are
really
projected
to
the
screen
projected
both
into
the
portraits
of
the
persons
and
into
the
pictures
of
the
scenery
and
background
into
which
the
personal
emotions
radiate
the
fundamental
principle
which
we
recognized
for
all
the
other
mental
states
is
accordingly
no
less
efficient
in
the
case
of
the
emotions
the
analysis
of
the
mind
of
the
audience
must
lead
however
to
that
second
group
of
emotions
those
in
which
the
spectator
responds
to
the
scenes
on
the
film
from
the
standpoint
of
his
independent
affective
life
we
see
an
overbearing
pompous
person
who
is
filled
with
the
emotion
of
solemnity
and
yet
he
awakens
in
us
the
emotion
of
humor
we
answer
by
our
ridicule
we
see
the
scoundrel
who
in
the
melodramatic
photoplay
is
filled
with
fiendish
malice
and
yet
we
do
not
respond
by
imitating
his
emotion
we
feel
moral
indignation
toward
his
personality
we
see
the
laughing
rejoicing
child
who
while
he
picks
the
berries
from
the
edge
of
the
precipice
is
not
aware
that
he
must
fall
down
if
the
hero
does
not
snatch
him
back
at
the
last
moment
of
course
we
feel
the
child
joy
with
him
otherwise
we
should
not
even
understand
his
behaviour
but
we
feel
more
strongly
the
fear
and
the
horror
of
which
the
child
himself
does
not
know
anything
the
photoplaywrights
have
so
far
hardly
ventured
to
project
this
second
class
of
emotion
which
the
spectator
superadds
to
the
events
into
the
show
on
the
screen
only
tentative
suggestions
can
be
found
the
enthusiasm
or
the
disapproval
or
indignation
of
the
spectator
is
sometimes
released
in
the
lights
and
shades
and
in
the
setting
of
the
landscape
there
are
still
rich
possibilities
along
this
line
the
photoplay
has
hardly
come
to
its
own
with
regard
to
these
secondary
emotions
here
it
has
not
emancipated
itself
sufficiently
from
the
model
of
the
stage
those
emotions
arise
of
course
in
the
audience
of
a
theater
too
but
the
dramatic
stage
can
not
embody
them
in
the
opera
the
orchestra
may
symbolize
them
for
the
photoplay
which
is
not
bound
to
the
physical
succession
of
events
but
gives
us
only
the
pictorial
reflection
there
is
an
unlimited
field
for
the
expression
of
these
attitudes
in
ourselves
but
the
wide
expansion
of
this
field
and
of
the
whole
manifoldness
of
emotional
possibilities
in
the
moving
pictures
is
not
sufficiently
characterized
as
long
as
we
think
only
of
the
optical
representation
in
the
actual
outer
world
the
camera
men
of
the
moving
pictures
have
photographed
the
happenings
of
the
world
and
all
its
wonders
have
gone
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
up
to
the
clouds
they
have
surprised
the
beasts
in
the
jungles
and
in
the
arctic
ice
they
have
dwelt
with
the
lowest
races
and
have
captured
the
greatest
men
of
our
time
and
they
are
always
haunted
by
the
fear
that
the
supply
of
new
sensations
may
be
exhausted
curiously
enough
they
have
so
far
ignored
the
fact
that
an
inexhaustible
wealth
of
new
impressions
is
at
their
disposal
which
has
hardly
been
touched
as
yet
there
is
a
material
and
a
formal
side
to
the
pictures
which
we
see
in
their
rapid
succession
the
material
side
is
controlled
by
the
content
of
what
is
shown
to
us
but
the
formal
side
depends
upon
the
outer
conditions
under
which
this
content
is
exhibited
even
with
ordinary
photographs
we
are
accustomed
to
discriminate
between
those
in
which
every
detail
is
very
sharp
and
others
often
much
more
artistic
in
which
everything
looks
somewhat
misty
and
blurring
and
in
which
sharp
outlines
are
avoided
we
have
this
formal
aspect
of
course
still
more
prominently
if
we
see
the
same
landscape
or
the
same
person
painted
by
a
dozen
different
artists
each
one
has
his
own
style
or
to
point
to
another
elementary
factor
the
same
series
of
moving
pictures
may
be
given
to
us
with
a
very
slow
or
with
a
rapid
turning
of
the
crank
it
is
the
same
street
scene
and
yet
in
the
one
case
everyone
on
the
street
seems
leisurely
to
saunter
along
while
in
the
other
case
there
is
a
general
rush
and
hurry
nothing
is
changed
but
the
temporal
form
and
in
going
over
from
the
sharp
image
to
the
blurring
one
nothing
is
changed
but
a
certain
spatial
form
the
content
remains
the
same
as
soon
as
we
give
any
interest
to
this
formal
aspect
of
the
presentation
we
must
recognize
that
the
photoplaywright
has
here
possibilities
to
which
nothing
corresponds
in
the
world
of
the
stage
take
the
case
that
we
want
to
produce
an
effect
of
trembling
we
might
use
the
pictures
as
the
camera
has
taken
them
sixteen
in
a
second
but
in
reproducing
them
on
the
screen
we
change
their
order
after
giving
the
first
four
pictures
we
go
back
to
picture
then
give
and
return
to
then
and
go
back
to
and
so
on
any
other
rhythm
of
course
is
equally
possible
the
effect
is
one
which
never
occurs
in
nature
and
which
could
not
be
produced
on
the
stage
the
events
for
a
moment
go
backward
a
certain
vibration
goes
through
the
world
like
the
tremolo
of
the
orchestra
or
we
demand
from
our
camera
a
still
more
complex
service
we
put
the
camera
itself
on
a
slightly
rocking
support
and
then
every
point
must
move
in
strange
curves
and
every
motion
takes
an
uncanny
whirling
character
the
content
still
remains
the
same
as
under
normal
conditions
but
the
changes
in
the
formal
presentation
give
to
the
mind
of
the
spectator
unusual
sensations
which
produce
a
new
shading
of
the
emotional
background
of
course
impressions
which
come
to
our
eye
can
at
first
awaken
only
sensations
and
a
sensation
is
not
an
emotion
but
it
is
well
known
that
in
the
view
of
modern
physiological
psychology
our
consciousness
of
the
emotion
itself
is
shaped
and
marked
by
the
sensations
which
arise
from
our
bodily
organs
as
soon
as
such
abnormal
visual
impressions
stream
into
our
consciousness
our
whole
background
of
fusing
bodily
sensations
becomes
altered
and
new
emotions
seem
to
take
hold
of
us
if
we
see
on
the
screen
a
man
hypnotized
in
the
doctor
office
the
patient
himself
may
lie
there
with
closed
eyes
nothing
in
his
features
expressing
his
emotional
setting
and
nothing
radiating
to
us
but
if
now
only
the
doctor
and
the
patient
remain
unchanged
and
steady
while
everything
in
the
whole
room
begins
at
first
to
tremble
and
then
to
wave
and
to
change
its
form
more
and
more
rapidly
so
that
a
feeling
of
dizziness
comes
over
us
and
an
uncanny
ghastly
unnaturalness
overcomes
the
whole
surrounding
of
the
hypnotized
person
we
ourselves
become
seized
by
the
strange
emotion
it
is
not
worth
while
to
go
into
further
illustrations
here
as
this
possibility
of
the
camera
work
still
belongs
entirely
to
the
future
it
could
not
be
otherwise
as
we
remember
that
the
whole
moving
picture
play
arose
from
the
slavish
imitation
of
the
drama
and
began
only
slowly
to
find
its
own
artistic
methods
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
formal
changes
of
the
pictorial
presentation
will
be
legion
as
soon
as
the
photoartists
give
their
attention
to
this
neglected
aspect
the
value
of
these
formal
changes
for
the
expression
of
the
emotions
may
become
remarkable
the
characteristic
features
of
many
an
attitude
and
feeling
which
can
not
be
expressed
without
words
today
will
then
be
aroused
in
the
mind
of
the
spectator
through
the
subtle
art
of
the
camera
part
ii
the
esthetics
of
the
photoplay
chapter
vii
the
purpose
of
art
we
have
analyzed
the
mental
functions
which
are
most
powerful
in
the
audience
of
the
photoplay
we
studied
the
mere
act
of
perceiving
the
pictures
on
the
screen
of
perceiving
their
apparently
plastic
character
their
depth
and
their
apparent
movements
we
turned
then
to
those
psychical
acts
by
which
we
respond
to
the
perceived
impressions
in
the
foreground
stood
the
act
of
attention
but
then
we
followed
the
play
of
associations
of
memory
of
imagination
of
suggestion
and
most
important
of
all
we
traced
the
distribution
of
interest
finally
we
spoke
of
the
feelings
and
emotions
with
which
we
accompany
the
play
certainly
all
this
does
not
exhaust
the
mental
reactions
which
arise
in
our
mind
when
we
witness
a
drama
of
the
film
we
have
not
spoken
for
instance
of
the
action
which
the
plot
of
the
story
or
its
social
background
may
start
in
our
soul
the
suffering
of
the
poor
the
injustice
by
which
the
weak
may
be
forced
into
the
path
of
crime
and
a
hundred
other
social
motives
may
be
impressed
on
us
by
the
photoplay
thoughts
about
human
society
about
laws
and
reforms
about
human
differences
and
human
fates
may
fill
our
mind
yet
this
is
not
one
of
the
characteristic
functions
of
the
moving
pictures
it
is
a
side
effect
which
may
set
in
just
as
it
may
result
from
reading
the
newspapers
or
from
hearing
of
practical
affairs
in
life
but
in
all
our
discussions
we
have
also
left
out
another
mental
process
namely
esthetic
emotion
we
did
speak
about
the
emotions
which
the
plot
of
the
play
stirs
up
we
discussed
the
feelings
in
which
we
sympathize
with
the
characters
of
the
scene
in
which
we
share
their
suffering
and
their
joy
and
we
also
spoke
about
that
other
group
of
emotions
by
which
we
take
a
mental
attitude
toward
the
behaviour
of
the
persons
in
the
play
but
there
is
surely
a
third
group
of
feelings
and
emotions
which
we
have
not
yet
considered
namely
those
of
our
joy
in
the
play
our
esthetic
satisfaction
or
dissatisfaction
we
have
omitted
them
intentionally
because
the
study
of
this
group
of
feelings
involves
a
discussion
of
the
esthetic
process
as
such
and
we
have
left
all
the
esthetic
problems
for
this
second
part
of
our
investigation
if
we
disregard
this
pleasure
or
displeasure
in
the
beauty
of
the
photoplay
and
reflect
only
on
the
processes
of
perception
attention
interest
memory
imagination
suggestion
and
emotion
which
we
have
analyzed
we
see
that
we
everywhere
come
to
the
same
result
one
general
principle
seemed
to
control
the
whole
mental
mechanism
of
the
spectator
or
rather
the
relation
between
the
mental
mechanism
and
the
pictures
on
the
screen
we
recognized
that
in
every
case
the
objective
world
of
outer
events
had
been
shaped
and
molded
until
it
became
adjusted
to
the
subjective
movements
of
the
mind
the
mind
develops
memory
ideas
and
imaginative
ideas
in
the
moving
pictures
they
become
reality
the
mind
concentrates
itself
on
a
special
detail
in
its
act
of
attention
and
in
the
of
the
moving
pictures
this
inner
state
is
objectified
the
mind
is
filled
with
emotions
and
by
means
of
the
camera
the
whole
scenery
echoes
them
even
in
the
most
objective
factor
of
the
mind
the
perception
we
find
this
peculiar
oscillation
we
perceive
the
movement
and
yet
we
perceive
it
as
something
which
has
not
its
independent
character
as
an
outer
world
process
because
our
mind
has
built
it
up
from
single
pictures
rapidly
following
one
another
we
perceive
things
in
their
plastic
depth
and
yet
again
the
depth
is
not
that
of
the
outer
world
we
are
aware
of
its
unreality
and
of
the
pictorial
flatness
of
the
impressions
in
every
one
of
these
features
the
contrast
to
the
mental
impressions
from
the
real
stage
is
obvious
there
in
the
theater
we
know
at
every
moment
that
we
see
real
plastic
men
before
us
that
they
are
really
in
motion
when
they
walk
and
talk
and
that
on
the
other
hand
it
is
our
own
doing
and
not
a
part
of
the
play
when
our
attention
turns
to
this
or
that
detail
when
our
memory
brings
back
events
of
the
past
when
our
imagination
surrounds
them
with
fancies
and
emotions
and
here
it
seems
we
have
a
definite
starting
point
for
an
esthetic
comparison
if
we
raise
the
unavoidable
question
how
does
the
photoplay
compare
with
the
drama
we
seem
to
have
sufficient
material
on
hand
to
form
an
esthetic
judgment
the
verdict
it
appears
can
hardly
be
doubtful
must
we
not
say
art
is
imitation
of
nature
the
drama
can
show
us
on
the
stage
a
true
imitation
of
real
life
the
scenes
proceed
just
as
they
would
happen
anywhere
in
the
outer
world
men
of
flesh
and
blood
with
really
plastic
bodies
stand
before
us
they
move
like
any
moving
body
in
our
surroundings
moreover
those
happenings
on
the
stage
just
like
the
events
in
life
are
independent
of
our
subjective
attention
and
memory
and
imagination
they
go
their
objective
course
thus
the
theater
comes
so
near
to
its
purpose
of
imitating
the
world
of
men
that
the
comparison
with
the
photoplay
suggests
almost
a
disastrous
failure
of
the
art
of
the
film
the
color
of
the
world
has
disappeared
the
persons
are
dumb
no
sound
reaches
our
ear
the
depth
of
the
scene
appears
unreal
the
motion
has
lost
its
natural
character
worst
of
all
the
objective
course
of
events
is
falsified
our
own
attention
and
memory
and
imagination
have
shifted
and
remodeled
the
events
until
they
look
as
nature
could
never
show
them
what
we
really
see
can
hardly
be
called
any
longer
an
imitation
of
the
world
such
as
the
theater
gives
us
when
the
graphophone
repeats
a
beethoven
symphony
the
voluminousness
of
the
orchestra
is
reduced
to
a
thin
feeble
surface
sound
and
no
one
would
accept
this
product
of
the
disk
and
the
diaphragm
as
a
full
substitute
for
the
performance
of
the
real
orchestra
but
after
all
every
instrument
is
actually
represented
and
we
can
still
discriminate
the
violins
and
the
celli
and
the
flutes
in
exactly
the
same
order
and
tonal
and
rhythmic
relation
in
which
they
appear
in
the
original
the
graphophone
music
appears
therefore
much
better
fitted
for
replacing
the
orchestra
than
the
moving
pictures
are
to
be
a
substitute
for
the
theater
there
all
the
essential
elements
seem
conserved
here
just
the
essentials
seem
to
be
lost
and
the
aim
of
the
drama
to
imitate
life
with
the
greatest
possible
reality
seems
hopelessly
beyond
the
flat
colorless
pictures
of
the
photoplay
still
more
might
we
say
that
the
plaster
of
paris
cast
is
a
fair
substitute
for
the
marble
statue
it
shares
with
the
beautiful
marble
work
the
same
form
and
imitates
the
body
of
the
living
man
just
as
well
as
the
marble
statue
moreover
this
product
of
the
mechanical
process
has
the
same
white
color
which
the
original
work
of
the
sculptor
possesses
hence
we
must
acknowledge
it
as
a
fair
approach
to
the
plastic
work
of
art
in
the
same
way
the
chromo
print
gives
the
essentials
of
the
oil
painting
everywhere
the
technical
process
has
secured
a
reproduction
of
the
work
of
art
which
sounds
or
looks
almost
like
the
work
of
the
great
artist
and
only
the
technique
of
the
moving
pictures
which
so
clearly
tries
to
reproduce
the
theater
performance
stands
so
utterly
far
behind
the
art
of
the
actor
is
not
an
esthetic
judgment
of
rejection
demanded
by
good
taste
and
sober
criticism
we
may
tolerate
the
photoplay
because
by
the
inexpensive
technical
method
which
allows
an
unlimited
multiplication
of
the
performances
it
brings
at
least
a
shadow
of
the
theater
to
the
masses
who
can
not
afford
to
see
real
actors
but
the
cultivated
mind
might
better
enjoy
plaster
of
paris
casts
and
chromo
prints
and
graphophone
music
than
the
moving
pictures
with
their
complete
failure
to
give
us
the
essentials
of
the
real
stage
we
have
heard
this
message
or
if
it
was
not
expressed
in
clear
words
it
surely
lingered
for
a
long
while
in
the
minds
of
all
those
who
had
a
serious
relation
to
art
it
probably
still
prevails
today
among
many
even
if
they
appreciate
the
more
ambitious
efforts
of
the
photoplaywrights
in
the
most
recent
years
the
philanthropic
pleasure
in
the
furnishing
of
cheap
entertainment
and
the
recognition
that
a
certain
advance
has
recently
been
made
seem
to
alleviate
the
esthetic
situation
but
the
core
of
public
opinion
remains
the
same
the
moving
pictures
are
no
real
art
and
yet
all
this
arguing
and
all
this
hasty
settling
of
a
most
complex
problem
is
fundamentally
wrong
it
is
based
on
entirely
mistaken
ideas
concerning
the
aims
and
purposes
of
art
if
those
errors
were
given
up
and
if
the
right
understanding
of
the
moving
pictures
were
to
take
hold
of
the
community
nobody
would
doubt
that
the
chromo
print
and
the
graphophone
and
the
plaster
cast
are
indeed
nothing
but
inexpensive
substitutes
for
art
with
many
essential
artistic
elements
left
out
and
therefore
ultimately
unsatisfactory
to
a
truly
artistic
taste
but
everybody
would
recognize
at
the
same
time
that
the
relation
of
the
photoplay
to
the
theater
is
a
completely
different
one
and
that
the
difference
counts
entirely
in
favor
of
the
moving
pictures
are
not
and
ought
never
to
be
imitations
of
the
theater
they
can
never
give
the
esthetic
values
of
the
theater
but
no
more
can
the
theater
give
the
esthetic
values
of
the
with
the
rise
of
the
moving
pictures
has
come
an
entirely
new
independent
art
which
must
develop
its
own
life
conditions
the
moving
pictures
would
indeed
be
a
complete
failure
if
that
popular
theory
of
art
which
we
suggested
were
right
but
that
theory
is
wrong
from
beginning
to
end
and
it
must
not
obstruct
the
way
to
a
better
insight
which
recognizes
that
the
stage
and
the
screen
are
as
fundamentally
different
as
sculpture
and
painting
or
as
lyrics
and
music
drama
and
the
photoplay
are
two
coördinated
arts
each
perfectly
valuable
in
the
one
can
not
replace
the
other
and
the
shortcomings
of
the
one
as
against
the
other
reflect
only
the
fact
that
the
one
has
a
history
of
fifteen
years
while
the
other
has
one
of
five
thousand
this
is
the
thesis
which
we
want
to
prove
and
the
first
step
to
it
must
be
to
ask
what
is
the
aim
of
art
if
not
the
imitation
of
reality
but
can
the
claim
that
art
imitates
nature
or
rather
that
imitation
is
the
essence
of
art
be
upheld
if
we
seriously
look
over
the
field
of
artistic
creations
would
it
not
involve
the
expectation
that
the
artistic
value
would
be
the
greater
the
more
the
ideal
of
imitation
is
approached
a
perfect
imitation
which
looks
exactly
like
the
original
would
give
us
the
highest
art
yet
every
page
in
the
history
of
art
tells
us
the
opposite
we
admire
the
marble
statue
and
we
despise
as
inartistic
the
colored
wax
figures
there
is
no
difficulty
in
producing
colored
wax
figures
which
look
so
completely
like
real
persons
that
the
visitor
at
an
exhibit
may
easily
be
deceived
and
may
ask
information
from
the
wax
man
leaning
over
the
railing
on
the
other
hand
what
a
tremendous
distance
between
reality
and
the
marble
statue
with
its
uniform
white
surface
it
could
never
deceive
us
and
as
an
imitation
it
would
certainly
be
a
failure
is
it
different
with
a
painting
here
the
color
may
be
quite
similar
to
the
original
but
unlike
the
marble
it
has
lost
its
depth
and
shows
us
nature
on
a
flat
surface
again
we
could
never
be
deceived
and
it
is
not
the
painter
ambition
to
make
us
believe
for
a
moment
that
reality
is
before
us
moreover
neither
the
sculptor
nor
the
painter
gives
us
less
valuable
work
when
they
offer
us
a
bust
or
a
painted
head
only
instead
of
the
whole
figure
and
yet
we
have
never
seen
in
reality
a
human
body
ending
at
the
chest
we
admire
a
fine
etching
hardly
less
than
a
painting
here
we
have
neither
the
plastic
effect
of
the
sculpture
nor
the
color
of
the
painting
the
essential
features
of
the
real
model
are
left
out
as
an
imitation
it
would
fail
disastrously
what
is
imitated
in
a
lyric
poem
through
more
than
two
thousand
years
we
have
appreciated
the
works
of
the
great
dramatists
who
had
their
personages
speak
in
the
rhythms
of
metrical
language
every
iambic
verse
is
a
deviation
from
reality
if
they
had
tried
to
imitate
nature
antigone
and
hamlet
would
have
spoken
the
prose
of
daily
life
does
a
beautiful
arch
or
dome
or
tower
of
a
building
imitate
any
part
of
reality
is
its
architectural
value
dependent
upon
the
similarity
to
nature
or
does
the
melody
or
harmony
in
music
offer
an
imitation
of
the
surrounding
world
wherever
we
examine
without
prejudice
the
mental
effects
of
true
works
of
art
in
literature
or
music
in
painting
or
sculpture
in
decorative
arts
or
architecture
we
find
that
the
central
esthetic
value
is
directly
opposed
to
the
spirit
of
imitation
a
work
of
art
may
and
must
start
from
something
which
awakens
in
us
the
interests
of
reality
and
which
contains
traits
of
reality
and
to
that
extent
it
can
not
avoid
some
imitation
but
becomes
art
just
in
so
far
as
it
overcomes
reality
stops
imitating
and
leaves
the
imitated
reality
behind
it
is
artistic
just
in
so
far
as
it
does
not
imitate
reality
but
changes
the
world
selects
from
it
special
features
for
new
purposes
remodels
the
world
and
is
through
this
truly
creative
to
imitate
the
world
is
a
mechanical
process
to
transform
the
world
so
that
it
becomes
a
thing
of
beauty
is
the
purpose
of
art
the
highest
art
may
be
furthest
removed
from
reality
we
have
not
even
the
right
to
say
that
this
process
of
selection
from
reality
means
that
we
keep
the
beautiful
elements
of
it
and
simply
omit
and
eliminate
the
ugly
ones
this
again
is
not
in
the
least
characteristic
of
art
however
often
the
popular
mind
may
couple
this
superficial
idea
with
that
other
one
that
art
consists
of
imitation
it
is
not
true
that
the
esthetic
value
depends
upon
the
beauty
of
the
selected
material
the
men
and
women
whom
rembrandt
painted
were
not
beautiful
persons
the
ugliest
woman
may
be
the
subject
of
a
most
beautiful
painting
the
beautiful
landscape
may
of
course
be
material
for
a
beautiful
landscape
painting
but
the
chances
are
great
that
such
a
pretty
vista
will
attract
the
dilettante
and
not
the
real
artist
who
knows
that
the
true
value
of
his
painting
is
independent
of
the
prettiness
of
the
model
he
knows
that
a
muddy
country
road
or
a
dirty
city
street
or
a
trivial
little
pond
may
be
the
material
for
immortal
pictures
he
who
writes
literature
does
not
select
scenes
of
life
which
are
beautiful
in
themselves
scenes
which
we
would
have
liked
to
live
through
full
of
radiant
happiness
and
joy
he
does
not
eliminate
from
his
picture
of
life
that
which
is
disturbing
to
the
peace
of
the
soul
repellant
and
ugly
and
immoral
on
the
contrary
all
the
great
works
of
literature
have
shown
us
dark
shades
of
life
beside
the
light
ones
they
have
spoken
of
unhappiness
and
pain
as
often
as
of
joy
we
have
suffered
with
our
poets
and
in
so
far
as
the
musical
composer
expresses
the
emotions
of
life
the
great
symphonies
have
been
full
of
pathos
and
tragedy
true
art
has
always
been
selection
but
never
selection
of
the
beautiful
elements
in
outer
reality
but
if
the
esthetic
value
is
independent
of
the
imitative
approach
to
reality
and
independent
of
the
elimination
of
unpleasant
elements
or
of
the
collection
and
addition
of
pleasant
traits
what
does
the
artist
really
select
and
combine
in
his
creation
how
does
he
shape
the
world
how
does
nature
look
when
it
has
been
remolded
by
the
artistic
temperament
and
imagination
what
is
left
of
the
real
landscape
when
the
engraver
needle
has
sketched
it
what
is
left
of
the
tragic
events
in
real
life
when
the
lyric
poet
has
reshaped
them
in
a
few
rhymed
stanzas
perhaps
we
may
bring
the
characteristic
features
of
the
process
most
easily
to
recognition
if
we
contrast
them
with
another
kind
of
reshaping
process
the
same
landscape
which
the
artist
sketches
the
same
historic
event
which
the
lyric
poet
interprets
in
his
verses
may
be
grasped
by
the
human
mind
in
a
wholly
different
way
we
need
only
think
of
the
scientific
work
of
the
scholar
he
too
may
have
the
greatest
interest
in
the
landscape
which
the
engraver
has
rendered
the
tree
on
the
edge
of
the
rock
torn
by
the
storm
and
at
the
foot
of
the
cliff
the
sea
with
its
whitecapped
waves
he
too
is
absorbed
by
the
tragic
death
of
a
lincoln
but
what
is
the
scholar
attitude
is
it
his
aim
to
reproduce
the
landscape
or
the
historic
event
certainly
not
the
meaning
of
science
and
scholarship
and
of
knowledge
in
general
would
be
completely
misunderstood
if
their
aim
were
thought
to
be
simply
the
repeating
of
the
special
facts
in
reality
the
scientist
tries
to
explain
the
facts
and
even
his
description
is
meant
to
serve
his
explanation
he
turns
to
that
tree
on
the
cliff
with
the
interest
of
studying
its
anatomical
structure
he
examines
with
a
microscope
the
cells
of
those
tissues
in
the
branches
and
leaves
in
order
that
he
may
explain
the
growth
of
the
tree
and
its
development
from
the
germ
the
storm
which
whips
its
branches
is
to
him
a
physical
process
for
which
he
seeks
the
causes
far
removed
the
sea
is
to
him
a
substance
which
he
resolves
in
his
laboratory
into
its
chemical
elements
and
which
he
explains
by
tracing
the
geological
changes
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
in
short
the
scientist
is
not
interested
in
that
particular
object
only
but
in
its
connections
with
the
total
universe
he
explains
the
event
by
a
reference
to
general
laws
which
are
effective
everywhere
every
single
growth
and
movement
is
linked
by
him
with
the
endless
chain
of
causes
and
effects
he
surely
reshapes
the
experience
in
connecting
every
single
impression
with
the
totality
of
events
in
finding
the
general
in
the
particular
in
transforming
the
given
facts
into
the
scientific
scheme
of
an
atomistic
universe
it
is
not
different
from
the
historical
event
to
the
scholarly
historian
the
death
of
lincoln
is
meaningless
if
it
is
not
seen
in
its
relation
to
and
connection
with
the
whole
history
of
the
civil
war
and
if
this
again
is
not
understood
as
the
result
of
the
total
development
of
the
united
states
and
who
can
understand
the
growth
of
the
united
states
unless
the
whole
of
modern
history
is
seen
as
a
background
and
unless
the
ideas
of
state
philosophy
which
have
built
up
the
american
democracy
are
grasped
in
their
connection
with
the
whole
story
of
european
political
thought
in
preceding
centuries
the
scholar
may
turn
to
natural
or
to
social
events
to
waves
or
trees
or
men
every
process
and
action
in
the
world
gains
interest
for
him
only
by
being
connected
with
other
things
and
events
every
point
which
he
marks
is
the
nodal
point
for
numberless
relations
to
grasp
a
fact
in
the
sense
of
scholarly
knowledge
means
to
see
it
in
all
its
connections
and
the
work
of
the
scholar
is
not
simply
to
hold
the
fact
as
he
becomes
aware
of
it
but
to
trace
the
connections
and
to
supplement
them
by
his
thought
until
a
completed
system
of
interrelated
facts
in
science
or
in
history
is
established
now
we
are
better
prepared
to
recognize
the
characteristic
function
of
the
artist
he
is
doing
exactly
the
opposite
of
what
the
scholar
is
aiming
at
both
are
changing
and
remolding
the
given
thing
or
event
in
the
interest
of
their
ideal
aims
but
the
ideal
aim
of
beauty
and
art
is
in
complete
contrast
to
the
ideal
aim
of
scholarly
knowledge
the
scholar
we
see
establishes
connections
by
which
the
special
thing
loses
all
character
of
separateness
he
binds
it
to
all
the
remainder
of
the
physical
and
social
universe
the
artist
on
the
contrary
cuts
off
every
possible
connection
he
puts
his
landscape
into
a
frame
so
that
every
possible
link
with
the
surrounding
world
is
severed
he
places
his
statue
on
a
pedestal
so
that
it
can
not
possibly
step
into
the
room
around
it
he
makes
his
persons
speak
in
verse
so
that
they
can
not
possibly
be
connected
with
the
intercourse
of
the
day
he
tells
his
story
so
that
nothing
can
happen
after
the
last
chapter
work
of
art
shows
us
the
things
and
events
perfectly
complete
in
themselves
freed
from
all
connections
which
lead
beyond
their
own
limits
that
is
in
perfect
both
the
truth
which
the
scholar
discovers
and
the
beauty
which
the
artist
creates
are
valuable
but
it
is
now
clear
that
the
value
in
both
cases
lies
not
in
the
mere
repetition
of
the
offerings
of
reality
there
is
no
reason
whatever
for
appreciating
a
mere
imitation
or
repetition
of
that
which
exists
in
the
world
neither
the
scholar
nor
the
artist
could
do
better
than
nature
or
history
the
value
in
both
cases
lies
just
in
the
deviation
from
reality
in
the
service
of
human
desires
and
ideals
the
desire
and
ideal
of
the
scholar
is
to
give
us
an
interconnected
world
in
which
we
understand
everything
by
its
being
linked
with
everything
else
and
the
desire
and
ideal
of
the
artist
in
every
possible
art
is
to
give
us
things
which
are
freed
from
the
connection
of
the
world
and
which
stand
before
us
complete
in
themselves
the
things
of
the
outer
world
have
thousandfold
ties
with
nature
and
history
an
object
becomes
beautiful
when
it
is
delivered
from
these
ties
and
in
order
to
secure
this
result
we
must
take
it
away
from
the
background
of
reality
and
reproduce
it
in
such
a
form
that
it
is
unmistakably
different
from
the
real
things
which
are
enchained
by
the
causes
and
effects
of
nature
why
does
this
satisfy
us
why
is
it
valuable
to
have
a
part
of
nature
or
life
liberated
from
all
connection
with
the
world
why
does
it
make
us
happy
to
see
anything
in
its
perfect
isolation
an
isolation
which
real
life
seldom
offers
and
which
only
art
can
give
in
complete
perfection
the
motives
which
lead
us
to
value
the
product
of
the
scholar
are
easily
recognized
he
aims
toward
connection
he
reshapes
the
world
until
it
appears
connected
because
that
helps
us
to
foresee
the
effects
of
every
event
and
teaches
us
to
master
nature
so
that
we
can
use
it
for
our
practical
achievements
but
why
do
we
appreciate
no
less
the
opposite
work
which
the
artist
is
doing
might
we
not
answer
that
this
enjoyment
of
the
artistic
work
results
from
the
fact
that
only
in
contact
with
an
isolated
experience
can
we
feel
perfectly
happy
whatever
we
meet
in
life
or
nature
awakes
in
us
desires
impulses
to
action
suggestions
and
questions
which
must
be
answered
life
is
a
continuous
striving
nothing
is
an
end
in
itself
and
therefore
nothing
is
a
source
of
complete
rest
everything
is
a
stimulus
to
new
wishes
a
source
of
new
uneasiness
which
longs
for
new
satisfaction
in
the
next
and
again
the
next
thing
life
pushes
us
forward
yet
sometimes
a
touch
of
nature
comes
to
us
we
are
stirred
by
a
thrill
of
life
which
awakens
plenty
of
impulses
but
which
offers
satisfaction
to
all
these
impulses
in
itself
it
does
not
lead
beyond
itself
but
contains
in
its
own
midst
everything
which
answers
the
questions
which
brings
the
desires
to
rest
wherever
we
meet
such
an
offering
of
nature
we
call
it
beautiful
we
speak
of
the
beautiful
landscape
of
the
beautiful
face
and
wherever
we
meet
it
in
life
we
speak
of
love
of
friendship
of
peace
of
harmony
the
word
harmony
may
even
cover
both
nature
and
life
wherever
it
happens
that
every
line
and
every
curve
and
every
color
and
every
movement
in
the
landscape
is
so
harmonious
with
all
the
others
that
every
suggestion
which
one
stirs
up
is
satisfied
by
another
there
it
is
perfect
and
we
are
completely
happy
in
it
in
the
life
relations
of
love
and
friendship
and
peace
there
is
again
this
complete
harmony
of
thought
and
feeling
and
will
in
which
every
desire
is
satisfied
if
our
own
mind
is
in
such
flawless
harmony
we
feel
the
true
happiness
which
crowns
our
life
such
harmony
in
which
every
part
is
the
complete
fulfillment
of
that
which
the
other
parts
demand
when
nothing
is
suggested
which
is
not
fulfilled
in
the
midst
of
the
same
experience
where
nothing
points
beyond
and
everything
is
complete
in
the
offering
itself
must
be
a
source
of
inexhaustible
happiness
to
remold
nature
and
life
so
that
it
offers
such
complete
harmony
in
itself
that
it
does
not
point
beyond
its
own
limits
but
is
an
ultimate
unity
through
the
harmony
of
its
parts
this
is
the
aim
of
the
isolation
which
the
artist
alone
achieves
that
restful
happiness
which
the
beautiful
landscape
or
the
harmonious
life
relation
can
furnish
us
in
blessed
instants
of
our
struggling
life
is
secured
as
a
joy
forever
when
the
painter
or
the
sculptor
the
dramatist
or
the
poet
the
composer
or
the
photoplaywright
recomposes
nature
and
life
and
shows
us
a
unity
which
does
not
lead
beyond
itself
but
is
in
itself
perfectly
harmonious
chapter
viii
the
means
of
the
various
arts
we
have
sought
the
aim
which
underlies
all
artistic
creation
and
were
led
in
this
search
to
paths
which
seem
far
away
from
our
special
problem
the
art
of
the
photoplay
yet
we
have
steadily
come
nearer
to
it
we
had
to
go
the
longer
way
because
there
can
be
no
other
method
to
reach
a
decision
concerning
the
esthetic
value
and
significance
of
the
photoplay
we
must
clearly
see
what
art
in
general
aims
at
if
we
want
to
recognize
the
relative
standing
of
the
film
art
and
the
art
of
the
theater
if
we
superficially
accept
the
popular
idea
that
the
value
of
the
photoplay
is
to
be
measured
by
the
nearness
with
which
it
approaches
the
standards
of
the
real
theater
and
that
the
task
of
the
theater
is
to
imitate
life
as
closely
as
possible
the
esthetic
condemnation
of
the
photoplay
is
necessary
the
pictures
on
the
screen
then
stand
far
behind
the
actual
playing
on
the
stage
in
every
respect
but
if
we
find
that
the
aim
of
art
including
the
dramatic
art
is
not
to
imitate
life
but
to
reset
it
in
a
way
which
is
totally
different
from
reality
then
an
entirely
new
perspective
is
opened
the
dramatic
way
may
then
be
only
one
of
the
artistic
possibilities
the
kinematoscopic
way
may
be
another
which
may
have
entirely
different
methods
and
yet
may
be
just
as
valuable
and
esthetically
pure
as
the
art
of
the
theater
the
drama
and
the
photoplay
may
serve
the
purpose
of
art
with
equal
sincerity
and
perfection
and
may
reach
the
same
goal
with
sharply
contrasting
means
our
next
step
which
brings
us
directly
to
the
threshold
of
the
photoplayhouse
is
accordingly
to
study
the
difference
of
the
various
methods
which
the
different
arts
use
for
their
common
purpose
what
characterizes
a
particular
art
as
such
when
we
have
recognized
the
special
traits
of
the
traditional
arts
we
shall
be
better
prepared
to
ask
whether
the
methods
of
the
photoplay
do
not
characterize
this
film
creation
also
as
a
art
coördinated
with
the
older
forms
of
beauty
we
saw
that
the
aim
of
every
art
is
to
isolate
some
object
of
experience
in
nature
or
social
life
in
such
a
way
that
it
becomes
complete
in
itself
and
satisfies
by
itself
every
demand
which
it
awakens
if
every
desire
which
it
stimulates
is
completely
fulfilled
by
its
own
parts
that
is
if
it
is
a
complete
harmony
we
the
spectators
the
listeners
the
readers
are
perfectly
satisfied
and
this
complete
satisfaction
is
the
characteristic
esthetic
joy
the
first
demand
which
is
involved
in
this
characterization
of
art
is
that
the
offering
of
the
artist
shall
really
awaken
interests
as
only
a
constant
stirring
up
of
desires
together
with
their
constant
fulfillment
keeps
the
flame
of
esthetic
enjoyment
alive
when
nothing
stirs
us
when
nothing
interests
us
we
are
in
a
state
of
indifference
outside
the
realm
of
art
this
also
separates
the
esthetic
pleasure
from
the
ordinary
selfish
pleasures
of
life
they
are
based
on
the
satisfaction
of
desires
too
but
a
kind
of
satisfaction
through
which
the
desire
itself
disappears
the
pleasure
in
a
meal
to
be
sure
can
have
its
esthetic
side
as
often
the
harmony
of
the
tastes
and
odors
and
sights
of
a
rich
feast
may
be
brought
to
a
certain
artistic
perfection
but
mere
pleasure
in
eating
has
no
esthetic
value
as
the
object
is
destroyed
by
the
partaking
and
not
only
the
cake
disappears
but
also
our
desire
for
the
cake
when
the
desire
is
fulfilled
and
we
are
satiated
the
work
of
art
aims
to
keep
both
the
demand
and
its
fulfillment
forever
awake
but
then
this
stirring
up
of
interests
demands
more
than
anything
else
a
careful
selection
of
those
features
in
reality
which
ought
to
be
admitted
into
the
work
of
art
a
thousand
traits
of
the
landscape
are
trivial
and
insignificant
and
most
of
what
happens
in
the
social
life
around
us
even
where
a
great
action
is
going
on
is
in
itself
commonplace
and
dull
and
without
consequences
for
the
event
which
stirs
us
the
very
first
requirement
for
the
artistic
creation
is
therefore
the
elimination
of
the
indifferent
the
selection
of
those
features
of
the
complex
offering
of
nature
or
social
life
which
tell
the
real
story
which
express
the
true
emotional
values
and
which
suggest
the
interest
for
everything
which
is
involved
in
this
particular
episode
of
the
world
but
this
leads
on
to
the
natural
consequence
that
the
artist
must
not
only
select
the
important
traits
but
must
artificially
heighten
their
power
and
increase
their
strength
we
spoke
of
the
landscape
with
the
tree
on
the
rock
and
the
roaring
surf
and
we
saw
how
the
scientist
studies
its
smallest
elements
the
cells
of
the
tree
the
molecules
of
the
seawater
and
of
the
rock
how
differently
does
the
artist
proceed
he
does
not
care
even
for
the
single
leaves
which
the
photographer
might
reproduce
if
a
painter
renders
such
a
landscape
with
his
masterly
brush
he
gives
us
only
the
leading
movements
of
those
branches
which
the
storm
tears
and
the
great
swing
in
the
curve
of
the
wave
but
those
forceful
lines
of
the
billows
those
sharp
contours
of
the
rock
contain
everything
which
expresses
their
spirit
it
is
not
different
with
the
author
who
writes
a
historical
novel
or
drama
every
man
life
is
crowded
with
the
trivialities
of
the
day
the
scholarly
historian
may
have
to
look
into
them
the
artist
selects
those
events
in
his
hero
life
which
truly
express
his
personality
and
which
are
fit
to
sustain
the
significant
plot
the
more
he
brings
those
few
elements
out
of
the
many
into
sharp
relief
the
more
he
stimulates
our
interest
and
makes
us
really
feel
with
the
persons
of
his
novel
or
drama
the
sculptor
even
selects
one
single
position
he
can
not
like
the
painter
give
us
any
background
he
can
not
make
his
hero
move
as
on
the
theater
stage
the
marble
statue
makes
the
one
position
of
the
hero
everlasting
but
this
is
so
selected
that
all
the
chance
aspects
and
fleeting
gestures
of
the
real
man
appear
insignificant
compared
with
the
one
most
expressive
and
most
characteristic
position
which
is
chosen
however
far
this
selection
of
the
essential
traits
removes
the
artistic
creation
from
the
mere
imitative
reproduction
of
the
world
a
much
greater
distance
from
reality
results
from
a
second
need
if
the
work
is
to
fulfill
the
purposes
of
art
we
saw
that
we
have
art
only
when
the
work
is
isolated
that
is
when
it
fulfills
every
demand
in
itself
and
does
not
point
beyond
itself
this
can
be
done
only
if
it
is
sharply
set
off
from
the
sphere
of
our
practical
interests
whatever
enters
into
our
practical
sphere
links
itself
with
our
impulses
to
real
action
and
the
action
would
involve
a
change
an
intrusion
an
influence
from
without
as
long
as
we
have
the
desire
to
change
anything
the
work
is
not
complete
in
itself
the
relation
of
the
work
to
us
as
persons
must
not
enter
into
our
awareness
of
it
at
all
as
soon
as
it
does
that
complete
restfulness
of
the
esthetic
enjoyment
is
lost
then
the
object
becomes
simply
a
part
of
our
practical
surroundings
the
fundamental
condition
of
art
therefore
is
that
we
shall
be
distinctly
conscious
of
the
unreality
of
the
artistic
production
and
that
means
that
it
must
be
absolutely
separated
from
the
real
things
and
men
that
it
must
be
isolated
and
kept
in
its
own
sphere
as
soon
as
a
work
of
art
tempts
us
to
take
it
as
a
piece
of
reality
it
has
been
dragged
into
the
sphere
of
our
practical
action
which
means
our
desire
to
put
ourselves
into
connection
with
it
its
completeness
in
itself
is
lost
and
its
value
for
our
esthetic
enjoyment
has
faded
away
now
we
understand
why
it
is
necessary
that
each
art
should
have
its
particular
method
for
fundamentally
changing
reality
now
we
recognize
that
it
is
by
no
means
a
weakness
of
sculpture
that
the
marble
statue
has
not
the
colors
of
life
but
a
whiteness
unlike
any
human
being
nor
does
it
appear
a
deficiency
in
the
painting
or
the
drawing
that
it
can
offer
two
dimensions
only
and
has
no
means
to
show
us
the
depth
of
real
nature
now
we
grasp
why
the
poet
expresses
his
feelings
and
thoughts
in
the
entirely
unnatural
language
of
rhythms
and
rhymes
now
we
see
why
every
work
of
art
has
its
frame
or
its
base
or
its
stage
everything
serves
that
central
purpose
the
separation
of
the
offered
experience
from
the
background
of
our
real
life
when
we
have
a
painted
garden
before
us
we
do
not
want
to
pick
the
flowers
from
the
beds
and
break
the
fruit
from
the
branches
the
flatness
of
the
picture
tells
us
that
this
is
no
reality
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
size
of
the
painting
may
not
be
different
from
that
of
the
windowpane
through
which
we
see
a
real
garden
we
have
no
thought
of
bringing
a
chair
or
a
warm
coat
for
the
woman
in
marble
the
work
which
the
sculptor
created
stands
before
us
in
a
space
into
which
we
can
not
enter
and
because
it
is
entirely
removed
from
the
reality
toward
which
our
actions
are
directed
we
become
esthetic
spectators
only
the
smile
of
the
marble
girl
wins
us
as
if
it
came
from
a
living
one
but
we
do
not
respond
to
her
welcome
just
as
she
appears
in
her
marble
form
she
is
complete
in
herself
without
any
relation
to
us
or
to
anyone
else
the
very
difference
from
reality
has
given
her
that
perfect
life
if
we
read
in
a
police
report
about
burglaries
we
may
lock
our
house
more
securely
if
we
read
about
a
flood
we
may
send
our
mite
if
we
read
about
an
elopement
we
may
try
to
find
out
what
happened
later
but
if
we
read
about
all
these
in
a
short
story
we
have
esthetic
enjoyment
only
if
the
author
somehow
makes
it
perfectly
clear
to
us
by
the
form
of
the
description
that
this
burglary
and
flood
and
elopement
do
not
belong
to
our
real
surroundings
and
exist
only
in
the
world
of
imagination
the
extreme
case
comes
to
us
in
the
theater
performance
we
see
there
real
human
beings
a
few
feet
from
us
we
see
in
the
melodrama
how
the
villain
approaches
his
victim
from
behind
with
a
dagger
we
feel
indignation
and
anger
and
yet
we
have
not
the
slightest
desire
to
jump
up
on
the
stage
and
stay
his
arm
the
artificial
setting
of
the
stage
the
lighted
proscenium
before
the
dark
house
have
removed
the
whole
action
from
the
world
which
is
connected
with
our
own
deeds
the
consciousness
of
unreality
which
the
theater
has
forced
on
us
is
the
condition
for
our
dramatic
interest
in
the
events
presented
if
we
were
really
deceived
and
only
for
a
moment
took
the
stage
quarrel
and
stage
crime
to
be
real
we
would
at
once
be
removed
from
the
height
of
esthetic
joy
to
the
level
of
common
experience
we
must
take
one
step
more
we
need
not
only
the
complete
separation
from
reality
by
the
changed
forms
of
experience
but
we
must
demand
also
that
this
unreal
thing
or
event
shall
be
complete
in
itself
the
artist
therefore
must
do
whatever
is
needed
to
satisfy
the
demands
which
any
part
awakens
if
one
line
in
the
painting
suggests
a
certain
mood
and
movement
the
other
lines
must
take
it
up
and
the
colors
must
sympathize
with
it
and
they
all
must
agree
with
the
pictured
content
the
tension
which
one
scene
in
the
drama
awakens
must
be
relieved
by
another
nothing
must
remain
unexplained
and
nothing
unfinished
we
do
not
want
to
know
what
is
going
on
behind
the
hills
of
the
landscape
painting
or
what
the
couple
in
the
comedy
will
do
after
the
engagement
in
the
last
act
on
the
other
hand
if
the
artist
adds
elements
which
are
in
harmony
with
the
demands
of
the
other
parts
they
are
esthetically
valuable
however
much
they
may
differ
from
the
actual
happenings
in
the
outer
world
in
the
painting
the
mermaid
may
have
her
tail
and
the
sculptured
child
may
have
his
angel
wings
and
fairies
may
appear
on
the
stage
in
short
every
demand
which
is
made
by
the
purpose
of
true
art
removes
us
from
reality
and
is
contrary
to
the
superficial
claim
that
art
ought
to
rest
on
skillful
imitation
the
true
victory
of
art
lies
in
the
overcoming
of
the
real
appearance
and
every
art
is
genuine
which
fulfills
this
esthetic
desire
for
history
or
for
nature
in
its
own
way
the
number
of
ways
can
not
be
determined
beforehand
by
the
study
of
painting
and
etching
and
drawing
merely
we
could
not
foresee
that
there
is
also
possible
an
art
like
sculpture
and
by
studying
epic
and
lyric
poetry
we
could
not
construct
beforehand
the
forms
of
the
drama
the
genius
of
mankind
had
to
discover
ever
new
forms
in
which
the
interest
in
reality
is
conserved
and
yet
the
things
and
events
are
so
completely
changed
that
they
are
separated
from
all
possible
reality
isolated
from
all
connections
and
made
complete
in
themselves
we
have
not
yet
spoken
about
the
one
art
which
gives
us
this
perfect
satisfaction
in
the
isolated
material
satisfies
every
demand
which
it
awakens
and
yet
which
is
further
removed
from
the
reality
we
know
than
any
other
artistic
creation
music
those
tones
with
which
the
composer
builds
up
his
melodies
and
harmonies
are
not
parts
of
the
world
in
which
we
live
at
all
none
of
our
actions
in
practical
life
is
related
to
tones
from
musical
instruments
and
yet
the
tones
of
a
symphony
may
arouse
in
us
the
deepest
emotions
the
most
solemn
feelings
and
the
most
joyful
ones
they
are
symbols
of
our
world
which
bring
with
them
its
sadness
and
its
happiness
we
feel
the
rhythm
of
the
tones
fugitive
light
and
joyful
or
quiet
heavy
and
sustained
and
they
impress
us
as
energies
which
awaken
our
own
impulses
our
own
tensions
and
relaxations
we
enter
into
the
play
of
those
tones
which
with
their
intervals
and
their
instrumental
tone
color
appear
like
a
wonderful
mosaic
of
agreements
and
disagreements
yet
each
disagreement
resolves
itself
into
a
new
agreement
those
tones
seek
one
another
they
have
a
life
of
their
own
complete
in
itself
we
do
not
want
to
change
it
our
mind
simply
echoes
their
desires
and
their
satisfaction
we
feel
with
them
and
are
happy
in
their
ultimate
agreement
without
which
no
musical
melody
would
be
beautiful
bound
by
the
inner
law
which
is
proclaimed
by
the
first
tones
every
coming
tone
is
prepared
the
whole
tone
movement
points
toward
the
next
one
it
is
a
world
of
inner
like
that
of
the
colors
in
a
painting
of
the
curves
in
a
work
of
sculpture
like
the
rhythms
and
rhymes
in
a
stanza
but
beyond
the
mere
of
the
tones
and
rhythms
as
such
the
musical
piece
as
a
whole
unveils
to
us
a
world
of
emotion
music
does
not
depict
the
physical
nature
which
fine
arts
bring
to
us
nor
the
social
world
which
literature
embraces
but
the
inner
world
with
its
abundance
of
feelings
and
excitements
it
isolates
our
inner
experience
and
within
its
limits
brings
it
to
that
perfect
which
is
the
characteristic
of
every
art
we
might
easily
trace
further
the
various
means
by
which
each
particular
art
overcomes
the
chaos
of
the
world
and
renders
a
part
of
it
in
a
perfectly
isolated
form
in
which
all
elements
are
in
mutual
agreement
we
might
develop
out
of
this
fundamental
demand
of
art
all
the
special
forms
which
are
characteristic
in
its
various
fields
we
might
also
turn
to
the
applied
arts
to
architecture
to
arts
and
crafts
and
so
on
and
see
how
new
rules
must
arise
from
the
combination
of
purely
artistic
demands
and
those
of
practical
utility
but
this
would
lead
us
too
far
into
esthetic
theory
while
our
aim
is
to
push
forward
toward
the
problem
of
the
photoplay
of
painting
of
drama
and
of
music
we
had
to
speak
because
with
them
the
photoplay
does
share
certain
important
conditions
and
accordingly
certain
essential
forms
of
rendering
the
world
each
element
of
the
photoplay
is
a
picture
flat
like
that
which
the
painter
creates
and
the
pictorial
character
is
fundamental
for
the
art
of
the
film
but
surely
the
photoplay
shares
many
conditions
with
the
drama
on
the
stage
the
presentation
of
conflicting
action
among
men
in
dramatic
scenes
is
the
content
on
the
stage
as
on
the
screen
our
chief
claim
however
was
that
we
falsify
the
meaning
of
the
photoplay
if
we
simply
subordinate
it
to
the
esthetic
conditions
of
the
drama
it
is
different
from
mere
pictures
and
it
is
different
from
the
drama
too
however
much
relation
it
has
to
both
but
we
come
nearer
to
the
understanding
of
its
true
position
in
the
esthetic
world
if
we
think
at
the
same
time
of
that
other
art
upon
which
we
touched
the
art
of
the
musical
tones
they
have
overcome
the
outer
world
and
the
social
world
entirely
they
unfold
our
inner
life
our
mental
play
with
its
feelings
and
emotions
its
memories
and
fancies
in
a
material
which
seems
exempt
from
the
laws
of
the
world
of
substance
and
material
tones
which
are
fluttering
and
fleeting
like
our
own
mental
states
of
course
a
photoplay
is
not
a
piece
of
music
its
material
is
not
sound
but
light
but
the
photoplay
is
not
music
in
the
same
sense
in
which
it
is
not
drama
and
not
pictures
it
shares
something
with
all
of
them
it
stands
somewhere
among
and
apart
from
them
and
just
for
this
reason
it
is
an
art
of
a
particular
type
which
must
be
understood
through
its
own
conditions
and
for
which
its
own
esthetic
rules
must
be
traced
instead
of
drawing
them
simply
from
the
rules
of
the
theater
chapter
ix
the
means
of
the
photoplay
we
have
now
reached
the
point
at
which
we
can
knot
together
all
our
threads
the
psychological
and
the
esthetic
ones
if
we
do
so
we
come
to
the
true
thesis
of
this
whole
book
our
esthetic
discussion
showed
us
that
it
is
the
aim
of
art
to
isolate
a
significant
part
of
our
experience
in
such
a
way
that
it
is
separate
from
our
practical
life
and
is
in
complete
agreement
within
itself
our
esthetic
satisfaction
results
from
this
inner
agreement
and
harmony
but
in
order
that
we
may
feel
such
agreement
of
the
parts
we
must
enter
with
our
own
impulses
into
the
will
of
every
element
into
the
meaning
of
every
line
and
color
and
form
every
word
and
tone
and
note
only
if
everything
is
full
of
such
inner
movement
can
we
really
enjoy
the
harmonious
coöperation
of
the
parts
the
means
of
the
various
arts
we
saw
are
the
forms
and
methods
by
which
this
aim
is
fulfilled
they
must
be
different
for
every
material
moreover
the
same
material
may
allow
very
different
methods
of
isolation
and
elimination
of
the
insignificant
and
reënforcement
of
that
which
contributes
to
the
harmony
if
we
ask
now
what
are
the
characteristic
means
by
which
the
photoplay
succeeds
in
overcoming
reality
in
isolating
a
significant
dramatic
story
and
in
presenting
it
so
that
we
enter
into
it
and
yet
keep
it
away
from
our
practical
life
and
enjoy
the
harmony
of
the
parts
we
must
remember
all
the
results
to
which
our
psychological
discussion
in
the
first
part
of
the
book
has
led
us
we
recognized
there
that
the
photoplay
incomparable
in
this
respect
with
the
drama
gave
us
a
view
of
dramatic
events
which
was
completely
shaped
by
the
inner
movements
of
the
mind
to
be
sure
the
events
in
the
photoplay
happen
in
the
real
space
with
its
depth
but
the
spectator
feels
that
they
are
not
presented
in
the
three
dimensions
of
the
outer
world
that
they
are
flat
pictures
which
only
the
mind
molds
into
plastic
things
again
the
events
are
seen
in
continuous
movement
and
yet
the
pictures
break
up
the
movement
into
a
rapid
succession
of
instantaneous
impressions
we
do
not
see
the
objective
reality
but
a
product
of
our
own
mind
which
binds
the
pictures
together
but
much
stronger
differences
came
to
light
when
we
turned
to
the
processes
of
attention
of
memory
of
imagination
of
suggestion
of
division
of
interest
and
of
emotion
the
attention
turns
to
detailed
points
in
the
outer
world
and
ignores
everything
else
the
photoplay
is
doing
exactly
this
when
in
the
a
detail
is
enlarged
and
everything
else
disappears
memory
breaks
into
present
events
by
bringing
up
pictures
of
the
past
the
photoplay
is
doing
this
by
its
frequent
when
pictures
of
events
long
past
flit
between
those
of
the
present
the
imagination
anticipates
the
future
or
overcomes
reality
by
fancies
and
dreams
the
photoplay
is
doing
all
this
more
richly
than
any
chance
imagination
would
succeed
in
doing
but
chiefly
through
our
division
of
interest
our
mind
is
drawn
hither
and
thither
we
think
of
events
which
run
parallel
in
different
places
the
photoplay
can
show
in
intertwined
scenes
everything
which
our
mind
embraces
events
in
three
or
four
or
five
regions
of
the
world
can
be
woven
together
into
one
complex
action
finally
we
saw
that
every
shade
of
feeling
and
emotion
which
fills
the
spectator
mind
can
mold
the
scenes
in
the
photoplay
until
they
appear
the
embodiment
of
our
feelings
in
every
one
of
these
aspects
the
photoplay
succeeds
in
doing
what
the
drama
of
the
theater
does
not
attempt
if
this
is
the
outcome
of
esthetic
analysis
on
the
one
side
of
psychological
research
on
the
other
we
need
only
combine
the
results
of
both
into
a
unified
principle
photoplay
tells
us
the
human
story
by
overcoming
the
forms
of
the
outer
world
namely
space
time
and
causality
and
by
adjusting
the
events
to
the
forms
of
the
inner
world
namely
attention
memory
imagination
and
we
shall
gain
our
orientation
most
directly
if
once
more
under
this
point
of
view
we
compare
the
photoplay
with
the
performance
on
the
theater
stage
we
shall
not
enter
into
a
discussion
of
the
character
of
the
regular
theater
and
its
drama
we
take
this
for
granted
everybody
knows
that
highest
art
form
which
the
greeks
created
and
which
from
greece
has
spread
over
asia
europe
and
america
in
tragedy
and
in
comedy
from
ancient
times
to
ibsen
rostand
hauptmann
and
shaw
we
recognize
one
common
purpose
and
one
common
form
for
which
no
further
commentary
is
needed
how
does
the
photoplay
differ
from
a
theater
performance
we
insisted
that
every
work
of
art
must
be
somehow
separated
from
our
sphere
of
practical
interests
the
theater
is
no
exception
the
structure
of
the
theater
itself
the
framelike
form
of
the
stage
the
difference
of
light
between
stage
and
house
the
stage
setting
and
costuming
all
inhibit
in
the
audience
the
possibility
of
taking
the
action
on
the
stage
to
be
real
life
stage
managers
have
sometimes
tried
the
experiment
of
reducing
those
differences
for
instance
keeping
the
audience
also
in
a
fully
lighted
hall
and
they
always
had
to
discover
how
much
the
dramatic
effect
was
reduced
because
the
feeling
of
distance
from
reality
was
weakened
the
photoplay
and
the
theater
in
this
respect
are
evidently
alike
the
screen
too
suggests
from
the
very
start
the
complete
unreality
of
the
events
but
each
further
step
leads
us
to
remarkable
differences
between
the
stage
play
and
the
film
play
in
every
respect
the
film
play
is
further
away
from
the
physical
reality
than
the
drama
and
in
every
respect
this
greater
distance
from
the
physical
world
brings
it
nearer
to
the
mental
world
the
stage
shows
us
living
men
it
is
not
the
real
romeo
and
not
the
real
juliet
and
yet
the
actor
and
the
actress
have
the
ringing
voices
of
true
people
breathe
like
them
have
living
colors
like
them
and
fill
physical
space
like
them
what
is
left
in
the
photoplay
the
voice
has
been
stilled
the
photoplay
is
a
dumb
show
yet
we
must
not
forget
that
this
alone
is
a
step
away
from
reality
which
has
often
been
taken
in
the
midst
of
the
dramatic
world
whoever
knows
the
history
of
the
theater
is
aware
of
the
tremendous
rôle
which
the
pantomime
has
played
in
the
development
of
mankind
from
the
old
pantomimic
and
suggestive
dances
out
of
which
the
beginnings
of
the
real
drama
grew
to
the
fully
religious
pantomimes
of
medieval
ages
and
further
on
to
many
silent
mimic
elements
in
modern
performances
we
find
a
continuity
of
conventions
which
make
the
pantomime
almost
the
real
background
of
all
dramatic
development
we
know
how
popular
the
pantomimes
were
among
the
greeks
and
how
they
stood
in
the
foreground
in
the
imperial
period
of
rome
old
rome
cherished
the
mimic
clowns
but
still
more
the
tragic
pantomimics
their
very
nod
speaks
their
hands
talk
and
their
fingers
have
a
voice
after
the
fall
of
the
roman
empire
the
church
used
the
pantomime
for
the
portrayal
of
sacred
history
and
later
centuries
enjoyed
very
unsacred
histories
in
the
pantomimes
of
their
ballets
even
complex
artistic
tragedies
without
words
have
triumphed
on
our
stage
prodigue
which
came
from
paris
sumurun
which
came
from
berlin
petroushka
which
came
from
petrograd
conquered
the
american
stage
and
surely
the
loss
of
speech
while
it
increased
the
remoteness
from
reality
by
no
means
destroyed
the
continuous
consciousness
of
the
bodily
existence
of
the
actors
moreover
the
student
of
a
modern
pantomime
can
not
overlook
a
characteristic
difference
between
the
speechless
performance
on
the
stage
and
that
of
the
actors
of
a
photoplay
the
expression
of
the
inner
states
the
whole
system
of
gestures
is
decidedly
different
and
here
we
might
say
that
the
photoplay
stands
nearer
to
life
than
the
pantomime
of
course
the
photoplayer
must
somewhat
exaggerate
the
natural
expression
the
whole
rhythm
and
intensity
of
his
gestures
must
be
more
marked
than
it
would
be
with
actors
who
accompany
their
movements
by
spoken
words
and
who
express
the
meaning
of
their
thoughts
and
feelings
by
the
content
of
what
they
say
nevertheless
the
photoplayer
uses
the
regular
channels
of
mental
discharge
he
acts
simply
as
a
very
emotional
person
might
act
but
the
actor
who
plays
in
a
pantomime
can
not
be
satisfied
with
that
he
is
expected
to
add
something
which
is
entirely
unnatural
namely
a
kind
of
artificial
demonstration
of
his
emotions
he
must
not
only
behave
like
an
angry
man
but
he
must
behave
like
a
man
who
is
consciously
interested
in
his
anger
and
wants
to
demonstrate
it
to
others
he
exhibits
his
emotions
for
the
spectators
he
really
acts
theatrically
for
the
benefit
of
the
bystanders
if
he
did
not
try
to
do
so
his
means
of
conveying
a
rich
story
and
a
real
conflict
of
human
passions
would
be
too
meager
the
photoplayer
with
the
rapid
changes
of
scenes
has
other
possibilities
of
conveying
his
intentions
he
must
not
yield
to
the
temptation
to
play
a
pantomime
on
the
screen
or
he
will
seriously
injure
the
artistic
quality
of
the
reel
the
really
decisive
distance
from
bodily
reality
however
is
created
by
the
substitution
of
the
actor
picture
for
the
actor
himself
lights
and
shades
replace
the
manifoldness
of
color
effects
and
mere
perspective
must
furnish
the
suggestion
of
depth
we
traced
it
when
we
discussed
the
psychology
of
kinematoscopic
perception
but
we
must
not
put
the
emphasis
on
the
wrong
point
the
natural
tendency
might
be
to
lay
the
chief
stress
on
the
fact
that
those
people
in
the
photoplay
do
not
stand
before
us
in
flesh
and
blood
the
essential
point
is
rather
that
we
are
conscious
of
the
flatness
of
the
picture
if
we
were
to
see
the
actors
of
the
stage
in
a
mirror
it
would
also
be
a
reflected
image
which
we
perceive
we
should
not
really
have
the
actors
themselves
in
our
straight
line
of
vision
and
yet
this
image
would
appear
to
us
equivalent
to
the
actors
themselves
because
it
would
contain
all
the
depth
of
the
real
stage
the
film
picture
is
such
a
reflected
rendering
of
the
actors
the
process
which
leads
from
the
living
men
to
the
screen
is
more
complex
than
a
mere
reflection
in
a
mirror
but
in
spite
of
the
complexity
in
the
transmission
we
do
after
all
see
the
real
actor
in
the
picture
the
photograph
is
absolutely
different
from
those
pictures
which
a
clever
draughtsman
has
sketched
in
the
photoplay
we
see
the
actors
themselves
and
the
decisive
factor
which
makes
the
impression
different
from
seeing
real
men
is
not
that
we
see
the
living
persons
through
the
medium
of
photographic
reproduction
but
that
this
reproduction
shows
them
in
a
flat
form
the
bodily
space
has
been
eliminated
we
said
once
before
that
stereoscopic
arrangements
could
reproduce
somewhat
this
plastic
form
also
yet
this
would
seriously
interfere
with
the
character
of
the
photoplay
we
need
there
this
overcoming
of
the
depth
we
want
to
have
it
as
a
picture
only
and
yet
as
a
picture
which
strongly
suggests
to
us
the
actual
depth
of
the
real
world
we
want
to
keep
the
interest
in
the
plastic
world
and
want
to
be
aware
of
the
depth
in
which
the
persons
move
but
our
direct
object
of
perception
must
be
without
the
depth
that
idea
of
space
which
forces
on
us
most
strongly
the
idea
of
heaviness
solidity
and
substantiality
must
be
replaced
by
the
light
flitting
immateriality
but
the
photoplay
sacrifices
not
only
the
space
values
of
the
real
theater
it
disregards
no
less
its
order
of
time
the
theater
presents
its
plot
in
the
time
order
of
reality
it
may
interrupt
the
continuous
flow
of
time
without
neglecting
the
conditions
of
the
dramatic
art
there
may
be
twenty
years
between
the
third
and
the
fourth
act
inasmuch
as
the
dramatic
writer
must
select
those
elements
spread
over
space
and
time
which
are
significant
for
the
development
of
his
story
but
he
is
bound
by
the
fundamental
principle
of
real
time
that
it
can
move
only
forward
and
not
backward
whatever
the
theater
shows
us
now
must
come
later
in
the
story
than
that
which
it
showed
us
in
any
previous
moment
the
strict
classical
demand
for
complete
unity
of
time
does
not
fit
every
drama
but
a
drama
would
give
up
its
mission
if
it
told
us
in
the
third
act
something
which
happened
before
the
second
act
of
course
there
may
be
a
play
within
a
play
and
the
players
on
the
stage
which
is
set
on
the
stage
may
play
events
of
old
roman
history
before
the
king
of
france
but
this
is
an
enclosure
of
the
past
in
the
present
which
corresponds
exactly
to
the
actual
order
of
events
the
photoplay
on
the
other
hand
does
not
and
must
not
respect
this
temporal
structure
of
the
physical
universe
at
any
point
the
photoplay
interrupts
the
series
and
brings
us
back
to
the
past
we
studied
this
unique
feature
of
the
film
art
when
we
spoke
of
the
psychology
of
memory
and
imagination
with
the
full
freedom
of
our
fancy
with
the
whole
mobility
of
our
association
of
ideas
pictures
of
the
past
flit
through
the
scenes
of
the
present
time
is
left
behind
man
becomes
boy
today
is
interwoven
with
the
day
before
yesterday
the
freedom
of
the
mind
has
triumphed
over
the
unalterable
law
of
the
outer
world
it
is
interesting
to
watch
how
playwrights
nowadays
try
to
steal
the
thunder
of
the
photoplay
and
experiment
with
time
reversals
on
the
legitimate
stage
we
are
esthetically
on
the
borderland
when
a
grandfather
tells
his
grandchild
the
story
of
his
own
youth
as
a
warning
and
instead
of
the
spoken
words
the
events
of
his
early
years
come
before
our
eyes
this
is
after
all
quite
similar
to
a
play
within
a
play
a
very
different
experiment
is
tried
in
under
cover
the
third
act
which
plays
on
the
second
floor
of
the
house
ends
with
an
explosion
the
fourth
act
which
plays
downstairs
begins
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
the
explosion
here
we
have
a
real
denial
of
a
fundamental
condition
of
the
theater
or
if
we
stick
to
recent
products
of
the
american
stage
we
may
think
of
on
trial
a
play
which
perhaps
comes
nearest
to
a
dramatic
usurpation
of
the
rights
of
the
photoplay
we
see
the
court
scene
and
as
one
witness
after
another
begins
to
give
his
testimony
the
courtroom
is
replaced
by
the
scenes
of
the
actions
about
which
the
witness
is
to
report
another
clever
play
between
the
lines
ends
the
first
act
with
a
postman
bringing
three
letters
from
the
three
children
of
the
house
the
second
third
and
fourth
acts
lead
us
to
the
three
different
homes
from
which
the
letters
came
and
the
action
in
the
three
places
not
only
precedes
the
writing
of
the
letters
but
goes
on
at
the
same
time
the
last
act
finally
begins
with
the
arrival
of
the
letters
which
tell
the
ending
of
those
events
in
the
three
homes
such
experiments
are
very
suggestive
but
they
are
not
any
longer
pure
dramatic
art
it
is
always
possible
to
mix
arts
an
italian
painter
produces
very
striking
effects
by
putting
pieces
of
glass
and
stone
and
rope
into
his
paintings
but
they
are
no
longer
pure
paintings
the
drama
in
which
the
later
event
comes
before
the
earlier
is
an
esthetic
barbarism
which
is
entertaining
as
a
clever
trick
in
a
graceful
superficial
play
but
intolerable
in
ambitious
dramatic
art
it
is
not
only
tolerable
but
perfectly
natural
in
any
photoplay
the
pictorial
reflection
of
the
world
is
not
bound
by
the
rigid
mechanism
of
time
our
mind
is
here
and
there
our
mind
turns
to
the
present
and
then
to
the
past
the
photoplay
can
equal
it
in
its
freedom
from
the
bondage
of
the
material
world
but
the
theater
is
bound
not
only
by
space
and
time
whatever
it
shows
is
controlled
by
the
same
laws
of
causality
which
govern
nature
this
involves
a
complete
continuity
of
the
physical
events
no
cause
without
following
effect
no
effect
without
preceding
cause
this
whole
natural
course
is
left
behind
in
the
play
on
the
screen
the
deviation
from
reality
begins
with
that
resolution
of
the
continuous
movement
which
we
studied
in
our
psychological
discussions
we
saw
that
the
impression
of
movement
results
from
an
activity
of
the
mind
which
binds
the
separate
pictures
together
what
we
actually
see
is
a
composite
it
is
like
the
movement
of
a
fountain
in
which
every
jet
is
resolved
into
numberless
drops
we
feel
the
play
of
those
drops
in
their
sparkling
haste
as
one
continuous
stream
of
water
and
yet
are
conscious
of
the
myriads
of
drops
each
one
separate
from
the
others
this
fountainlike
spray
of
pictures
has
completely
overcome
the
causal
world
in
an
entirely
different
form
this
triumph
over
causality
appears
in
the
interruption
of
the
events
by
pictures
which
belong
to
another
series
we
find
this
whenever
the
scene
suddenly
changes
the
processes
are
not
carried
to
their
natural
consequences
a
movement
is
started
but
before
the
cause
brings
its
results
another
scene
has
taken
its
place
what
this
new
scene
brings
may
be
an
effect
for
which
we
saw
no
causes
but
not
only
the
processes
are
interrupted
the
intertwining
of
the
scenes
which
we
have
traced
in
detail
is
itself
such
a
contrast
to
causality
it
is
as
if
different
objects
could
fill
the
same
space
at
the
same
time
it
is
as
if
the
resistance
of
the
material
world
had
disappeared
and
the
substances
could
penetrate
one
another
in
the
interlacing
of
our
ideas
we
experience
this
superiority
to
all
physical
laws
the
theater
would
not
have
even
the
technical
means
to
give
us
such
impressions
but
if
it
had
it
would
have
no
right
to
make
use
of
them
as
it
would
destroy
the
basis
on
which
the
drama
is
built
we
have
only
another
case
of
the
same
type
in
those
series
of
pictures
which
aim
to
force
a
suggestion
on
our
mind
we
have
spoken
of
them
a
certain
effect
is
prepared
by
a
chain
of
causes
and
yet
when
the
causal
result
is
to
appear
the
film
is
cut
off
we
have
the
causes
without
the
effect
the
villain
thrusts
with
his
dagger
but
a
miracle
has
snatched
away
his
victim
the
moving
pictures
are
lifted
above
the
world
of
space
and
time
and
causality
and
are
freed
from
its
bounds
they
are
certainly
not
without
we
said
before
that
the
freedom
with
which
the
pictures
replace
one
another
is
to
a
large
degree
comparable
to
the
sparkling
and
streaming
of
the
musical
tones
the
yielding
to
the
play
of
the
mental
energies
to
the
attention
and
emotion
which
is
felt
in
the
film
pictures
is
still
more
complete
in
the
musical
melodies
and
harmonies
in
which
the
tones
themselves
are
merely
the
expressions
of
the
ideas
and
feelings
and
will
impulses
of
the
mind
their
harmonies
and
disharmonies
their
fusing
and
blending
is
not
controlled
by
any
outer
necessity
but
by
the
inner
agreement
and
disagreement
of
our
free
impulses
and
yet
in
this
world
of
musical
freedom
everything
is
completely
controlled
by
esthetic
necessities
no
sphere
of
practical
life
stands
under
such
rigid
rules
as
the
realm
of
the
composer
however
bold
the
musical
genius
may
be
he
can
not
emancipate
himself
from
the
iron
rule
that
his
work
must
show
complete
unity
in
itself
all
the
separate
prescriptions
which
the
musical
student
has
to
learn
are
ultimately
only
the
consequences
of
this
central
demand
which
music
the
freest
of
the
arts
shares
with
all
the
others
in
the
case
of
the
film
too
the
freedom
from
the
physical
forms
of
space
time
and
causality
does
not
mean
any
liberation
from
this
esthetic
bondage
either
on
the
contrary
just
as
music
is
surrounded
by
more
technical
rules
than
literature
the
photoplay
must
be
held
together
by
the
esthetic
demands
still
more
firmly
than
is
the
drama
the
arts
which
are
subordinated
to
the
conditions
of
space
time
and
causality
find
a
certain
firmness
of
structure
in
these
material
forms
which
contain
an
element
of
outer
connectedness
but
where
these
forms
are
given
up
and
where
the
freedom
of
mental
play
replaces
their
outer
necessity
everything
would
fall
asunder
if
the
esthetic
unity
were
disregarded
this
unity
is
first
of
all
the
unity
of
action
the
demand
for
it
is
the
same
which
we
know
from
the
drama
the
temptation
to
neglect
it
is
nowhere
greater
than
in
the
photoplay
where
outside
matter
can
so
easily
be
introduced
or
independent
interests
developed
it
is
certainly
true
for
the
photoplay
as
for
every
work
of
art
that
nothing
has
the
right
to
existence
in
its
midst
which
is
not
internally
needed
for
the
unfolding
of
the
unified
action
wherever
two
plots
are
given
to
us
we
receive
less
by
far
than
if
we
had
only
one
plot
we
leave
the
sphere
of
valuable
art
entirely
when
a
unified
action
is
ruined
by
mixing
it
with
declamation
and
propaganda
which
is
not
organically
interwoven
with
the
action
itself
it
may
be
still
fresh
in
memory
what
an
esthetically
intolerable
performance
was
offered
to
the
public
in
the
battlecry
of
peace
nothing
can
be
more
injurious
to
the
esthetic
cultivation
of
the
people
than
such
performances
which
hold
the
attention
of
the
spectators
by
ambitious
detail
and
yet
destroy
their
esthetic
sensibility
by
a
complete
disregard
of
the
fundamental
principle
of
art
the
demand
for
unity
but
we
recognized
also
that
this
unity
involves
complete
isolation
we
annihilate
beauty
when
we
link
the
artistic
creation
with
practical
interests
and
transform
the
spectator
into
a
selfishly
interested
bystander
the
scenic
background
of
the
play
is
not
presented
in
order
that
we
decide
whether
we
want
to
spend
our
next
vacation
there
the
interior
decoration
of
the
rooms
is
not
exhibited
as
a
display
for
a
department
store
the
men
and
women
who
carry
out
the
action
of
the
plot
must
not
be
people
whom
we
may
meet
tomorrow
on
the
street
all
the
threads
of
the
play
must
be
knotted
together
in
the
play
itself
and
none
should
be
connected
with
our
outside
interests
a
good
photoplay
must
be
isolated
and
complete
in
itself
like
a
beautiful
melody
it
is
not
an
advertisement
for
the
newest
fashions
this
unity
of
action
involves
unity
of
characters
it
has
too
often
been
maintained
by
those
who
theorize
on
the
photoplay
that
the
development
of
character
is
the
special
task
of
the
drama
while
the
photoplay
which
lacks
words
must
be
satisfied
with
types
probably
this
is
only
a
reflection
of
the
crude
state
which
most
photoplays
of
today
have
not
outgrown
internally
there
is
no
reason
why
the
means
of
the
photoplay
should
not
allow
a
rather
subtle
depicting
of
complex
character
but
the
chief
demand
is
that
the
characters
remain
consistent
that
the
action
be
developed
according
to
inner
necessity
and
that
the
characters
themselves
be
in
harmony
with
the
central
idea
of
the
plot
however
as
soon
as
we
insist
on
unity
we
have
no
right
to
think
only
of
the
action
which
gives
the
content
of
the
play
we
can
not
make
light
of
the
form
as
in
music
the
melody
and
rhythms
belong
together
as
in
painting
not
every
color
combination
suits
every
subject
and
as
in
poetry
not
every
stanza
would
agree
with
every
idea
so
the
photoplay
must
bring
action
and
pictorial
expression
into
perfect
harmony
but
this
demand
repeats
itself
in
every
single
picture
we
take
it
for
granted
that
the
painter
balances
perfectly
the
forms
in
his
painting
groups
them
so
that
an
internal
symmetry
can
be
felt
and
that
the
lines
and
curves
and
colors
blend
into
a
unity
every
single
picture
of
the
sixteen
thousand
which
are
shown
to
us
in
one
reel
ought
to
be
treated
with
this
respect
of
the
pictorial
artist
for
the
unity
of
the
forms
photoplay
shows
us
a
significant
conflict
of
human
actions
in
moving
pictures
which
freed
from
the
physical
forms
of
space
time
and
causality
are
adjusted
to
the
free
play
of
our
mental
experiences
and
which
reach
complete
isolation
from
the
practical
world
through
the
perfect
unity
of
plot
and
pictorial
chapter
x
the
demands
of
the
photoplay
we
have
found
the
general
formula
for
the
new
art
of
the
photoplay
we
may
turn
our
attention
to
some
consequences
which
are
involved
in
this
general
principle
and
to
some
esthetic
demands
which
result
from
it
naturally
the
greatest
of
all
of
them
is
the
one
for
which
no
specific
prescription
can
be
given
namely
the
imaginative
talent
of
the
scenario
writer
and
the
producer
the
new
art
is
in
that
respect
not
different
from
all
the
old
arts
a
beethoven
writes
immortal
symphonies
a
thousand
conductors
are
writing
symphonies
after
the
same
pattern
and
after
the
same
technical
rules
and
yet
not
one
survives
the
next
day
what
the
great
painter
or
sculptor
composer
or
poet
novelist
or
dramatist
gives
from
the
depth
of
his
artistic
personality
is
interesting
and
significant
and
the
unity
of
form
and
content
is
natural
and
perfect
what
untalented
amateurs
produce
is
trivial
and
flat
the
relation
of
form
and
content
is
forced
the
unity
of
the
whole
is
incomplete
between
these
two
extremes
any
possible
degree
of
approach
to
the
ideal
is
shown
in
the
history
of
human
arts
it
can
not
be
otherwise
with
the
art
of
the
film
even
the
clearest
recognition
of
the
specific
demands
of
the
photoplay
can
not
be
sufficient
to
replace
original
talent
or
genius
the
most
slavish
obedience
to
esthetic
demands
can
not
make
a
tiresome
plot
interesting
and
a
trivial
action
significant
if
there
is
anything
which
introduces
a
characteristic
element
into
the
creation
of
the
photoplay
as
against
all
other
arts
it
may
be
found
in
the
undeniable
fact
that
the
photoplay
always
demands
the
coöperation
of
two
inventive
personalities
the
scenario
writer
and
the
producer
some
collaboration
exists
in
other
arts
too
the
opera
demands
the
poet
and
the
composer
and
yet
the
text
of
the
opera
is
a
work
of
literature
independent
and
complete
in
itself
and
the
music
of
the
opera
has
its
own
life
again
every
musical
work
demands
the
performer
the
orchestra
must
play
the
symphonies
the
pianist
or
the
singer
must
make
the
melodies
living
the
actors
must
play
the
drama
but
the
music
is
a
perfect
work
of
art
even
before
it
is
sung
or
played
on
an
instrument
just
as
a
drama
is
complete
as
a
work
of
literature
even
if
it
never
reaches
the
stage
moreover
it
is
evident
that
the
realization
by
actors
is
needed
for
the
photoplay
too
but
we
may
disregard
that
what
we
have
in
mind
is
that
the
work
which
the
scenario
writer
creates
is
in
itself
still
entirely
imperfect
and
becomes
a
complete
work
of
art
only
through
the
action
of
the
producer
he
plays
a
rôle
entirely
different
from
that
of
the
mere
stage
manager
in
the
drama
the
stage
manager
carries
out
what
the
writer
of
the
drama
prescribes
however
much
his
own
skill
and
visual
imagination
and
insight
into
the
demands
of
the
characters
may
add
to
the
embodiment
of
the
dramatic
action
but
the
producer
of
the
photoplay
really
must
show
himself
a
creative
artist
inasmuch
as
he
is
the
one
who
actually
transforms
the
plays
into
pictures
the
emphasis
in
the
drama
lies
on
the
spoken
word
to
which
the
stage
manager
does
not
add
anything
it
is
all
contained
in
the
lines
in
the
photoplay
the
whole
emphasis
lies
on
the
picture
and
its
composition
is
left
entirely
to
the
producing
artist
but
the
scenario
writer
must
not
only
have
talent
for
dramatic
invention
and
construction
he
must
be
wide
awake
to
the
uniqueness
of
his
task
that
is
he
must
feel
at
every
moment
that
he
is
writing
for
the
screen
and
not
for
the
stage
or
for
a
book
and
this
brings
us
back
to
our
central
argument
he
must
understand
that
the
photoplay
is
not
a
photographed
drama
but
that
it
is
controlled
by
psychological
conditions
of
its
own
as
soon
as
it
is
grasped
that
the
film
play
is
not
simply
a
mechanical
reproduction
of
another
art
but
is
an
art
of
a
special
kind
it
follows
that
talents
of
a
special
kind
must
be
devoted
to
it
and
that
nobody
ought
to
feel
it
beneath
his
artistic
dignity
to
write
scenarios
in
the
service
of
this
new
art
no
doubt
the
moving
picture
performances
today
still
stand
on
a
low
artistic
level
nine
tenths
of
the
plays
are
cheap
melodramas
or
vulgar
farces
the
question
is
not
how
much
larger
a
percentage
of
really
valuable
dramas
can
be
found
in
our
theaters
many
of
their
plays
are
just
as
much
an
appeal
to
the
lowest
instincts
but
at
least
the
theater
is
not
forced
to
be
satisfied
with
such
degrading
comedies
and
pseudotragedies
the
world
literature
of
the
stage
contains
an
abundance
of
works
of
eternal
value
it
is
a
purely
social
and
not
an
esthetic
question
why
the
theaters
around
the
white
way
yield
to
the
vulgar
taste
instead
of
using
the
truly
beautiful
drama
for
the
raising
of
the
public
mind
the
moving
picture
theaters
face
an
entirely
different
situation
their
managers
may
have
the
best
intentions
to
give
better
plays
and
yet
they
are
unable
to
do
so
because
the
scenario
literature
has
so
far
nothing
which
can
be
compared
with
the
master
works
of
the
drama
and
nothing
of
this
higher
type
can
be
expected
or
hoped
for
until
the
creation
of
photoplays
is
recognized
as
worthy
of
the
highest
ideal
endeavor
nobody
denies
that
the
photoplay
shares
the
characteristic
features
of
the
drama
both
depend
upon
the
conflict
of
interests
and
of
acts
these
conflicts
tragic
or
comic
demand
a
similar
development
and
solution
on
the
stage
and
on
the
screen
a
mere
showing
of
human
activity
without
will
conflict
might
give
very
pleasant
moving
pictures
of
idyllic
or
romantic
character
or
perhaps
of
practical
interest
the
result
would
be
a
kind
of
lyric
or
epic
poem
on
the
screen
or
a
travelogue
or
what
not
but
it
would
never
shape
itself
into
a
photoplay
as
long
as
that
conflict
of
human
interests
which
the
drama
demands
was
lacking
yet
as
this
conflict
of
will
is
expressed
in
the
one
case
by
living
speaking
men
in
the
other
by
moving
pictures
the
difference
in
the
artistic
conception
must
surely
be
as
great
as
the
similarity
hence
one
of
the
supreme
demands
must
be
for
an
original
literature
of
real
power
and
significance
in
which
every
thought
is
generated
by
the
idea
of
the
screen
as
long
as
the
photoplays
are
fed
by
the
literature
of
the
stage
the
new
art
can
never
come
to
its
own
and
can
never
reach
its
real
goal
it
is
surely
no
fault
of
shakespeare
that
hamlet
and
king
lear
are
very
poor
photoplays
if
ever
a
shakespeare
arises
for
the
screen
his
work
would
be
equally
unsatisfactory
if
it
were
dragged
to
the
stage
peer
gynt
is
no
longer
ibsen
if
the
actors
are
dumb
the
novel
in
certain
respects
fares
still
worse
but
in
other
respects
some
degrees
better
it
is
true
that
in
the
superficial
literature
written
for
the
hour
the
demarcation
line
between
dramatic
and
narrative
works
is
often
ignored
the
best
sellers
of
the
novel
counter
are
often
warmed
over
into
successful
theater
plays
and
no
society
play
with
a
long
run
on
broadway
escapes
its
transformation
into
a
serial
novel
for
the
newspapers
but
where
literature
is
at
its
height
the
deep
difference
can
be
felt
distinctly
the
epic
art
including
the
novel
traces
the
experiences
and
the
development
of
a
character
while
the
drama
is
dependent
upon
the
conflict
of
character
mere
adventures
of
a
personality
are
never
sufficient
for
a
good
drama
and
are
not
less
unsatisfactory
for
the
plot
of
a
photoplay
in
the
novel
the
opposing
characters
are
only
a
part
of
the
social
background
which
is
needed
to
show
the
life
story
of
the
hero
or
heroine
they
have
not
the
independent
significance
which
is
essential
for
the
dramatic
conflict
the
novel
on
the
screen
if
it
is
a
true
novel
and
not
the
novelistic
rendering
of
what
is
really
a
dramatic
plot
must
be
lifeless
and
uninspiring
but
on
the
other
hand
the
photoplay
much
more
than
the
drama
emphasizes
the
background
of
human
action
and
it
shares
this
trait
with
the
novel
both
the
social
and
the
natural
backgrounds
are
the
real
setting
for
the
development
of
the
chief
character
in
the
story
these
features
can
easily
be
transferred
to
the
photoplay
and
for
this
reason
some
picturized
novels
have
had
the
advantage
over
the
photoplay
cut
from
the
drama
the
only
true
conclusion
must
remain
however
that
neither
drama
nor
novel
is
sufficient
for
the
film
scenarios
the
photopoet
must
turn
to
life
itself
and
must
remodel
life
in
the
artistic
forms
which
are
characteristic
of
his
particular
art
if
he
has
truly
grasped
the
fundamental
meaning
of
the
screen
world
his
imagination
will
guide
him
more
safely
than
his
reminiscences
of
dramas
which
he
has
seen
on
the
stage
and
of
novels
which
he
has
read
if
we
turn
to
a
few
special
demands
which
are
contained
in
such
a
general
postulate
for
a
new
artistic
method
we
naturally
think
at
once
of
the
rôle
of
words
the
drama
and
novel
live
by
words
how
much
of
this
noblest
vehicle
of
thought
can
the
photoplay
conserve
in
its
domain
we
all
know
what
a
large
part
of
the
photoplay
today
is
told
us
by
the
medium
of
words
and
phrases
how
little
would
we
know
what
those
people
are
talking
about
if
we
saw
them
only
acting
and
had
not
beforehand
the
information
which
the
leader
supplies
the
technique
differs
with
different
companies
some
experiment
with
projecting
the
spoken
words
into
the
picture
itself
bringing
the
phrase
in
glaring
white
letters
near
the
head
of
the
person
who
is
speaking
in
a
way
similar
to
the
methods
of
the
newspaper
cartoonists
but
mostly
the
series
of
the
pictures
is
interrupted
and
the
decisive
word
taken
directly
from
the
lips
of
the
hero
or
an
explanatory
statement
which
gives
meaning
to
the
whole
is
thrown
on
the
screen
sometimes
this
may
be
a
concession
to
the
mentally
less
trained
members
of
the
audience
but
usually
these
printed
comments
are
indispensable
for
understanding
the
plot
and
even
the
most
intelligent
spectator
would
feel
helpless
without
these
frequent
guideposts
but
this
habit
of
the
picture
houses
today
is
certainly
not
an
esthetic
argument
they
are
obliged
to
yield
to
the
scheme
simply
because
the
scenario
writers
are
still
untrained
and
clumsy
in
using
the
technique
of
the
new
art
some
religious
painters
of
medieval
times
put
in
the
picture
itself
phrases
which
the
persons
were
supposed
to
speak
as
if
the
words
were
leaving
their
mouths
but
we
could
not
imagine
raphael
and
michelangelo
making
use
of
a
method
of
communication
which
is
so
entirely
foreign
to
the
real
spirit
of
painting
every
art
grows
slowly
to
the
point
where
the
artist
relies
on
its
characteristic
and
genuine
forms
of
expression
elements
which
do
not
belong
to
it
are
at
first
mingled
in
it
and
must
be
slowly
eliminated
the
photoplay
of
the
day
after
tomorrow
will
surely
be
freed
from
all
elements
which
are
not
really
pictures
the
beginning
of
the
photoplay
as
a
mere
imitation
of
the
theater
is
nowhere
so
evident
as
in
this
inorganic
combination
with
bits
of
dialogue
or
explanatory
phrases
the
art
of
words
and
the
art
of
pictures
are
there
forcibly
yoked
together
whoever
writes
his
scenarios
so
that
the
pictures
can
not
be
understood
without
these
linguistic
crutches
is
an
esthetic
failure
in
the
new
art
the
next
step
toward
the
emancipation
of
the
photoplay
decidedly
must
be
the
creation
of
plays
which
speak
the
language
of
pictures
only
two
apparent
exceptions
seem
justified
it
is
not
contrary
to
the
internal
demands
of
the
film
art
if
a
complete
scene
has
a
title
a
leader
like
the
next
morning
or
after
three
years
or
in
south
africa
or
the
first
step
or
the
awakening
or
among
friends
has
the
same
character
as
the
title
of
a
painting
in
a
picture
gallery
if
we
read
in
our
catalogue
of
paintings
that
a
picture
is
called
landscape
or
portrait
we
feel
the
words
to
be
superfluous
if
we
read
that
its
title
is
london
bridge
in
mist
or
portrait
of
the
pope
we
receive
a
valuable
suggestion
which
is
surely
not
without
influence
on
our
appreciation
of
the
picture
and
yet
it
is
not
an
organic
part
of
the
painting
itself
in
this
sense
a
leader
as
title
for
a
scene
or
still
better
for
a
whole
reel
may
be
applied
without
any
esthetic
objection
the
other
case
which
is
not
only
possible
but
perfectly
justified
is
the
introduction
of
letters
telegrams
posters
newspaper
clippings
and
similar
printed
or
written
communications
in
a
pictorial
the
enlargement
of
which
makes
every
word
readable
this
scheme
is
more
and
more
introduced
into
the
plays
today
and
the
movement
is
in
a
proper
direction
the
words
of
the
telegram
or
of
the
signboard
and
even
of
the
cutting
from
the
newspaper
are
parts
of
the
reality
which
the
pictures
are
to
show
us
and
their
meaning
does
not
stand
outside
but
within
the
pictorial
story
the
true
artist
will
make
sparing
use
of
this
method
in
order
that
the
spectator
may
not
change
his
attitude
he
must
remain
in
an
inner
adjustment
to
pictorial
forms
and
must
not
switch
over
into
an
adaptation
to
sentences
but
if
its
use
is
not
exaggerated
the
method
is
legitimate
in
striking
contrast
to
the
inartistic
use
of
the
same
words
as
leaders
between
the
pictures
the
condemnation
of
guiding
words
in
the
interest
of
the
purity
of
the
picture
play
as
such
also
leads
to
earnest
objection
to
phonographic
accompaniments
those
who
like
edison
had
a
technical
scientific
and
social
interest
but
not
a
genuine
esthetic
point
of
view
in
the
development
of
the
moving
pictures
naturally
asked
themselves
whether
this
optical
imitation
of
the
drama
might
not
be
improved
by
an
acoustical
imitation
too
then
the
idea
would
be
to
connect
the
kinematoscope
with
the
phonograph
and
to
synchronize
them
so
completely
that
with
every
visible
movement
of
the
lips
the
audible
sound
of
the
words
would
leave
the
diaphragm
of
the
apparatus
all
who
devoted
themselves
to
this
problem
had
considerable
difficulties
and
when
their
ventures
proved
practical
failures
with
the
theater
audiences
they
were
inclined
to
blame
their
inability
to
solve
the
technical
problem
perfectly
they
were
not
aware
that
the
real
difficulty
was
an
esthetic
and
internal
one
even
if
the
voices
were
heard
with
ideal
perfection
and
exactly
in
time
with
the
movements
on
the
screen
the
effect
on
an
esthetically
conscientious
audience
would
have
been
disappointing
a
photoplay
can
not
gain
but
only
lose
if
its
visual
purity
is
destroyed
if
we
see
and
hear
at
the
same
time
we
do
indeed
come
nearer
to
the
real
theater
but
this
is
desirable
only
if
it
is
our
goal
to
imitate
the
stage
yet
if
that
were
the
goal
even
the
best
imitation
would
remain
far
inferior
to
an
actual
theater
performance
as
soon
as
we
have
clearly
understood
that
the
photoplay
is
an
art
in
itself
the
conservation
of
the
spoken
word
is
as
disturbing
as
color
would
be
on
the
clothing
of
a
marble
statue
it
is
quite
different
with
accompanying
music
even
if
the
music
in
the
overwhelming
majority
of
cases
were
not
so
pitifully
bad
as
it
is
in
most
of
the
picture
theaters
of
today
no
one
would
consider
it
an
organic
part
of
the
photoplay
itself
like
the
singing
in
the
opera
yet
the
need
of
such
a
more
or
less
melodious
and
even
more
or
less
harmonious
accompaniment
has
always
been
felt
and
even
the
poorest
substitute
for
decent
music
has
been
tolerated
as
seeing
long
reels
in
a
darkened
house
without
any
tonal
accompaniment
fatigues
and
ultimately
irritates
an
average
audience
the
music
relieves
the
tension
and
keeps
the
attention
awake
it
must
be
entirely
subordinated
and
it
is
a
fact
that
most
people
are
hardly
aware
of
the
special
pieces
which
are
played
while
they
would
feel
uncomfortable
without
them
but
it
is
not
at
all
necessary
for
the
music
to
be
limited
to
such
harmonious
smoothing
of
the
mind
by
rhythmical
tones
the
music
can
and
ought
to
be
adjusted
to
the
play
on
the
screen
the
more
ambitious
picture
corporations
have
clearly
recognized
this
demand
and
show
their
new
plays
with
exact
suggestions
for
the
choice
of
musical
pieces
to
be
played
as
accompaniment
the
music
does
not
tell
a
part
of
the
plot
and
does
not
replace
the
picture
as
words
would
do
but
simply
reënforces
the
emotional
setting
it
is
quite
probable
when
the
photoplay
art
has
found
its
esthetic
recognition
that
composers
will
begin
to
write
the
musical
score
for
a
beautiful
photoplay
with
the
same
enthusiasm
with
which
they
write
in
other
musical
forms
just
between
the
intolerable
accompaniment
by
printed
or
spoken
words
on
the
one
side
and
the
perfectly
welcome
rendering
of
emotionally
fitting
music
on
the
other
we
find
the
noises
with
which
the
photoplay
managers
like
to
accompany
their
performances
when
the
horses
gallop
we
must
hear
the
hoofbeats
if
rain
or
hail
is
falling
if
the
lightning
flashes
we
hear
the
splashing
or
the
thunderstorm
we
hear
the
firing
of
a
gun
the
whistling
of
a
locomotive
ships
bells
or
the
ambulance
gong
or
the
barking
dog
or
the
noise
when
charlie
chaplin
falls
downstairs
they
even
have
a
complicated
machine
the
allefex
which
can
produce
over
fifty
distinctive
noises
fit
for
any
photoplay
emergency
it
will
probably
take
longer
to
rid
the
photoplay
of
these
appeals
to
the
imagination
than
the
explanations
of
the
leaders
but
ultimately
they
will
have
to
disappear
too
they
have
no
right
to
existence
in
a
work
of
art
which
is
composed
of
pictures
in
so
far
as
they
are
simply
heightening
the
emotional
tension
they
may
enter
into
the
music
itself
but
in
so
far
as
they
tell
a
part
of
the
story
they
ought
to
be
ruled
out
as
intrusions
from
another
sphere
we
might
just
as
well
improve
the
painting
of
a
rose
garden
by
bathing
it
in
rose
perfume
in
order
that
the
spectators
might
get
the
odor
of
the
roses
together
with
the
sight
of
them
the
limitations
of
an
art
are
in
reality
its
strength
and
to
overstep
its
boundaries
means
to
weaken
it
it
may
be
more
open
to
discussion
whether
this
same
negative
attitude
ought
to
be
taken
toward
color
in
the
photoplay
it
is
what
wonderful
technical
progress
has
been
secured
by
those
who
wanted
to
catch
the
color
hues
and
tints
of
nature
in
their
moving
pictures
to
be
sure
many
of
the
prettiest
effects
in
color
are
even
today
produced
by
artificial
stencil
methods
photographs
are
simply
printed
in
three
colors
like
any
ordinary
color
print
the
task
of
cutting
those
many
stencils
for
the
thousands
of
pictures
on
a
reel
is
tremendous
and
yet
these
difficulties
have
been
overcome
any
desired
color
effect
can
be
obtained
by
this
method
and
the
beauty
of
the
best
specimens
is
unsurpassed
but
the
difficulty
is
so
great
that
it
can
hardly
become
a
popular
method
the
direct
photographing
of
the
colors
themselves
will
be
much
simpler
as
soon
as
the
method
is
completely
perfected
it
can
hardly
be
said
that
this
ideal
has
been
reached
today
the
successive
photographing
through
three
red
green
and
violet
screens
and
the
later
projection
of
the
pictures
through
screens
of
these
colors
seemed
scientifically
the
best
approach
yet
it
needed
a
multiplication
of
pictures
per
second
which
offered
extreme
difficulty
besides
an
extraordinary
increase
of
expense
the
practical
advance
seems
more
secure
along
the
line
of
the
kinemacolor
its
effects
are
secured
by
the
use
of
two
screens
only
not
quite
satisfactory
as
true
blue
impressions
have
to
suffer
and
the
reddish
and
greenish
ones
are
emphasized
moreover
the
eye
is
sometimes
disturbed
by
big
flashes
of
red
or
green
light
yet
the
beginnings
are
so
excellent
that
the
perfect
solution
of
the
technical
problem
may
be
expected
in
the
near
future
would
it
be
at
the
same
time
a
solution
of
the
esthetic
problem
it
has
been
claimed
by
friends
of
color
photography
that
at
the
present
stage
of
development
natural
color
photography
is
unsatisfactory
for
a
rendering
of
outer
events
because
any
scientific
or
historical
happening
which
is
reproduced
demands
exactly
the
same
colors
which
reality
shows
but
on
the
other
hand
the
process
seems
perfectly
sufficient
for
the
photoplay
because
there
no
objective
colors
are
expected
and
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
gowns
of
the
women
or
the
rugs
on
the
floor
show
the
red
and
green
too
vividly
and
the
blue
too
faintly
from
an
esthetic
point
of
view
we
ought
to
come
to
exactly
the
opposite
verdict
for
the
historical
events
even
the
present
technical
methods
are
on
the
whole
satisfactory
the
famous
british
coronation
pictures
were
superb
and
they
gained
immensely
by
the
rich
color
effects
they
gave
much
more
than
a
mere
photograph
in
black
and
white
and
the
splendor
and
glory
of
those
radiant
colors
suffered
little
from
the
suppression
of
the
bluish
tones
they
were
not
shown
in
order
to
match
the
colors
in
a
ribbon
store
for
the
news
pictures
of
the
day
the
kinemacolor
and
similar
schemes
are
excellent
but
when
we
come
to
photoplays
the
question
is
no
longer
one
of
technique
first
of
all
we
stand
before
the
problem
how
far
does
the
coloring
subordinate
itself
to
the
aim
of
the
photoplay
no
doubt
the
effect
of
the
individual
picture
would
be
heightened
by
the
beauty
of
the
colors
but
would
it
heighten
the
beauty
of
the
photoplay
would
not
this
color
be
again
an
addition
which
oversteps
the
essential
limits
of
this
particular
art
we
do
not
want
to
paint
the
cheeks
of
the
venus
of
milo
neither
do
we
want
to
see
the
coloring
of
mary
pickford
or
anita
stewart
we
became
aware
that
the
unique
task
of
the
photoplay
art
can
be
fulfilled
only
by
a
disregard
of
reality
the
real
human
persons
and
the
real
landscapes
must
be
left
behind
and
as
we
saw
must
be
transformed
into
pictorial
suggestions
only
we
must
be
strongly
conscious
of
their
pictorial
unreality
in
order
that
that
wonderful
play
of
our
inner
experiences
may
be
realized
on
the
screen
this
consciousness
of
unreality
must
seriously
suffer
from
the
addition
of
color
we
are
once
more
brought
too
near
to
the
world
which
really
surrounds
us
with
the
richness
of
its
colors
and
the
more
we
approach
it
the
less
we
gain
that
inner
freedom
that
victory
of
the
mind
over
nature
which
remains
the
ideal
of
the
photoplay
the
colors
are
almost
as
detrimental
as
the
voices
on
the
other
hand
the
producer
must
be
careful
to
keep
sufficiently
in
contact
with
reality
as
otherwise
the
emotional
interests
upon
which
the
whole
play
depends
would
be
destroyed
we
must
not
take
the
people
to
be
real
but
we
must
link
with
them
all
the
feelings
and
associations
which
we
would
connect
with
real
men
this
is
possible
only
if
in
their
flat
colorless
pictorial
setting
they
share
the
real
features
of
men
for
this
reason
it
is
important
to
suggest
to
the
spectator
the
impression
of
natural
size
the
demand
of
the
imagination
for
the
normal
size
of
the
persons
and
things
in
the
picture
is
so
strong
that
it
easily
and
constantly
overcomes
great
enlargements
or
reductions
we
see
at
first
a
man
in
his
normal
size
and
then
by
a
an
excessive
enlargement
of
his
head
yet
we
do
not
feel
it
as
if
the
person
himself
were
enlarged
by
a
characteristic
psychical
substitution
we
feel
rather
that
we
have
come
nearer
to
him
and
that
the
size
of
the
visual
image
was
increased
by
the
decreasing
of
the
distance
if
the
whole
picture
is
so
much
enlarged
that
the
persons
are
continually
given
much
above
normal
size
by
a
psychical
inhibition
we
deceive
ourselves
about
the
distance
and
believe
that
we
are
much
nearer
to
the
screen
than
we
actually
are
thus
we
instinctively
remain
under
the
impression
of
normal
appearances
but
this
spell
can
easily
be
broken
and
the
esthetic
effect
is
then
greatly
diminished
in
the
large
picture
houses
in
which
the
projecting
camera
is
often
very
far
from
the
screen
the
dimensions
of
the
persons
in
the
pictures
may
be
three
or
four
times
larger
than
human
beings
the
illusion
is
nevertheless
perfect
because
the
spectator
misjudges
the
distances
as
long
as
he
does
not
see
anything
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
screen
but
if
the
eye
falls
upon
a
woman
playing
the
piano
directly
below
the
picture
the
illusion
is
destroyed
he
sees
on
the
screen
enormous
giants
whose
hands
are
as
large
as
half
the
piano
player
and
the
normal
reactions
which
are
the
spring
for
the
enjoyment
of
the
play
are
suppressed
the
further
we
go
into
details
the
more
we
might
add
such
special
psychological
demands
which
result
from
the
fundamental
principles
of
the
new
art
but
it
would
be
misleading
if
we
were
also
to
raise
demands
concerning
a
point
which
has
often
played
the
chief
rôle
in
the
discussion
namely
the
selection
of
suitable
topics
writers
who
have
the
unlimited
possibilities
of
trick
pictures
and
film
illusions
in
mind
have
proclaimed
that
the
fairy
tale
with
its
magic
wonders
ought
to
be
its
chief
domain
as
no
theater
stage
could
enter
into
rivalry
how
many
have
enjoyed
neptune
daughter
the
mermaids
in
the
surf
and
the
sudden
change
of
the
witch
into
the
octopus
on
the
shore
and
the
joyful
play
of
the
watersprites
how
many
have
been
bewitched
by
princess
nicotina
when
she
trips
from
the
little
cigar
box
along
the
table
no
theater
could
dare
to
imitate
such
raptures
of
imagination
other
writers
have
insisted
on
the
superb
chances
for
gorgeous

the
surging
splendor
of
multitudes
we
see
thousands
in
sherman
march
to
the
sea
how
hopeless
would
be
any
attempt
to
imitate
it
on
the
stage
when
the
toreador
fights
the
bull
and
the
crowds
in
the
spanish
arena
enter
into
enthusiastic
frenzy
who
would
compare
it
with
those
painted
people
in
the
arena
when
the
opera
carmen
is
sung
again
others
emphasize
the
opportunity
for
historical
plays
or
especially
for
plays
with
unusual
scenic
setting
where
the
beauties
of
the
tropics
or
of
the
mountains
of
the
ocean
or
of
the
jungle
are
brought
into
living
contact
with
the
spectator
biblical
dramas
with
pictures
of
real
palestine
classical
plots
with
real
greece
or
rome
as
a
background
have
stirred
millions
all
over
the
globe
yet
the
majority
of
authors
claim
that
the
true
field
for
the
photoplay
is
the
practical
life
which
surrounds
us
as
no
artistic
means
of
literature
or
drama
can
render
the
details
of
life
with
such
convincing
sincerity
and
with
such
realistic
power
these
are
the
slums
not
seen
through
the
spectacles
of
a
littérateur
or
the
fancy
of
an
outsider
but
in
their
whole
abhorrent
nakedness
these
are
the
dark
corners
of
the
metropolis
where
crime
is
hidden
and
where
vice
is
growing
rankly
they
all
are
right
and
at
the
same
time
they
all
are
wrong
when
they
praise
one
at
the
expense
of
another
realistic
and
idealistic
practical
and
romantic
historical
and
modern
topics
are
fit
material
for
the
art
of
the
photoplay
its
world
is
as
unlimited
as
that
of
literature
and
the
same
is
true
of
the
style
of
treatment
the
humorous
if
it
is
true
humor
the
tragic
if
it
is
true
tragedy
the
gay
and
the
solemn
the
merry
and

pathetic

and

all
can
fulfill
the
demands
of
the
new
art
chapter
xi
the
function
of
the
photoplay
enthusiasts
claim
that
in
the
united
states
ten
million
people
daily
are
attending
picture
houses
sceptics
believe
that
only
two
or
three
millions
form
the
daily
attendance
but
in
any
case
the
movies
have
become
the
most
popular
entertainment
of
the
country
nay
of
the
world
and
their
influence
is
one
of
the
strongest
social
energies
of
our
time
signs
indicate
that
this
popularity
and
this
influence
are
increasing
from
day
to
day
what
are
the
causes
and
what
are
the
effects
of
this
movement
which
was
undreamed
of
only
a
short
time
ago
the
economists
are
certainly
right
when
they
see
the
chief
reason
for
this
crowding
of
picture
houses
in
the
low
price
of
admission
for
five
or
ten
cents
long
hours
of
thrilling
entertainment
in
the
best
seats
of
the
house
this
is
the
magnet
which
must
be
more
powerful
than
any
theater
or
concert
yet
the
rush
to
the
moving
pictures
is
steadily
increasing
while
the
prices
climb
up
the
dime
became
a
quarter
and
in
the
last
two
seasons
ambitious
plays
were
given
before
audiences
who
paid
the
full
theater
rates
the
character
of
the
audiences
too
suggests
that
inexpensiveness
alone
can
not
be
decisive
six
years
ago
a
keen
sociological
observer
characterized
the
patrons
of
the
picture
palaces
as
the
lower
middle
class
and
the
massive
public
youths
and
shopgirls
between
adolescence
and
maturity
small
dealers
pedlars
laborers
charwomen
besides
the
small
quota
of
children
this
would
be
hardly
a
correct
description
today
this
lower
middle
class
has
long
been
joined
by
the
upper
middle
class
to
be
sure
our
observer
of
that
long
forgotten
past
added
meekly
then
there
emerges
a
superior
person
or
two
like
yourself
attracted
by
mere
curiosity
and
kept
in
his
seat
by
interest
until
the
very
end
of
the
performance
this
type
sneers
aloud
to
proclaim
its
superiority
and
preserve
its
but
it
never
leaves
the
theater
until
it
must
today
you
and
i
are
seen
there
quite
often
and
we
find
that
our
friends
have
been
there
that
they
have
given
up
the
sneering
pose
and
talk
about
the
new
photoplay
as
a
matter
of
course
above
all
even
those
who
are
drawn
by
the
cheapness
of
the
performance
would
hardly
push
their
dimes
under
the
little
window
so
often
if
they
did
not
really
enjoy
the
plays
and
were
not
stirred
by
a
pleasure
which
holds
them
for
hours
after
all
it
must
be
the
content
of
the
performances
which
is
decisive
of
the
incomparable
triumph
we
have
no
right
to
conclude
from
this
that
only
the
merits
and
excellences
are
the
true
causes
of
their
success
a
caustic
critic
would
probably
suggest
that
just
the
opposite
traits
are
responsible
he
would
say
that
the
average
american
is
a
mixture
of
business
ragtime
and
sentimentality
he
satisfies
his
business
instinct
by
getting
so
much
for
his
nickel
he
enjoys
his
ragtime
in
the
slapstick
humor
and
gratifies
his
sentimentality
with
the
preposterous
melodramas
which
fill
the
program
this
is
quite
true
and
yet
it
is
not
true
at
all
success
has
crowned
every
effort
to
improve
the
photostage
the
better
the
plays
are
the
more
the
audience
approves
them
the
most
ambitious
companies
are
the
most
flourishing
ones
there
must
be
inner
values
which
make
the
photoplay
so
extremely
attractive
and
even
fascinating
to
a
certain
degree
the
mere
technical
cleverness
of
the
pictures
even
today
holds
the
interest
spellbound
as
in
those
early
days
when
nothing
but
this
technical
skill
could
claim
the
attention
we
are
still
startled
by
every
original
effect
even
if
the
mere
showing
of
movement
has
today
lost
its
impressiveness
moreover
we
are
captivated
by
the
undeniable
beauty
of
many
settings
the
melodrama
may
be
cheap
yet
it
does
not
disturb
the
cultured
mind
as
grossly
as
a
similar
tragic
vulgarity
would
on
the
real
stage
because
it
may
have
the
snowfields
of
alaska
or
the
palm
trees
of
florida
as
radiant
background
an
intellectual
interest
too
finds
its
satisfaction
we
get
an
insight
into
spheres
which
were
strange
to
us
where
outlying
regions
of
human
interest
are
shown
on
the
theater
stage
we
must
usually
be
satisfied
with
some
standardized
suggestion
here
in
the
moving
pictures
the
play
may
really
bring
us
to
mills
and
factories
to
farms
and
mines
to
courtrooms
and
hospitals
to
castles
and
palaces
in
any
land
on
earth
yet
a
stronger
power
of
the
photoplay
probably
lies
in
its
own
dramatic
qualities
the
rhythm
of
the
play
is
marked
by
unnatural
rapidity
as
the
words
are
absent
which
in
the
drama
as
in
life
fill
the
gaps
between
the
actions
the
gestures
and
deeds
themselves
can
follow
one
another
much
more
quickly
happenings
which
would
fill
an
hour
on
the
stage
can
hardly
fill
more
than
twenty
minutes
on
the
screen
this
heightens
the
feeling
of
vitality
in
the
spectator
he
feels
as
if
he
were
passing
through
life
with
a
sharper
accent
which
stirs
his
personal
energies
the
usual
of
the
photoplay
must
strengthen
this
effect
inasmuch
as
the
wordlessness
of
the
picture
drama
favors
a
certain
simplification
of
the
social
conflicts
the
subtler
shades
of
the
motives
naturally
demand
speech
the
later
plays
of
ibsen
could
hardly
be
transformed
into
photoplays
where
words
are
missing
the
characters
tend
to
become
stereotyped
and
the
motives
to
be
deprived
of
their
complexity
the
plot
of
the
photoplay
is
usually
based
on
the
fundamental
emotions
which
are
common
to
all
and
which
are
understood
by
everybody
love
and
hate
gratitude
and
envy
hope
and
fear
pity
and
jealousy
repentance
and
sinfulness
and
all
the
similar
crude
emotions
have
been
sufficient
for
the
construction
of
most
scenarios
the
more
mature
development
of
the
photoplay
will
certainly
overcome
this
primitive
character
as
while
such
an
effort
to
reduce
human
life
to
simple
instincts
is
very
convenient
for
the
photoplay
it
is
not
at
all
necessary
in
any
case
where
this
tendency
prevails
it
must
help
greatly
to
excite
and
to
intensify
the
personal
feeling
of
life
and
to
stir
the
depths
of
the
human
mind
but
the
richest
source
of
the
unique
satisfaction
in
the
photoplay
is
probably
that
esthetic
feeling
which
is
significant
for
the
new
art
and
which
we
have
understood
from
its
psychological
conditions
massive
outer
world
has
lost
its
weight
it
has
been
freed
from
space
time
and
causality
and
it
has
been
clothed
in
the
forms
of
our
own
consciousness
the
mind
has
triumphed
over
matter
and
the
pictures
roll
on
with
the
ease
of
musical
tones
it
is
a
superb
enjoyment
which
no
other
art
can
furnish
no
wonder
that
temples
for
the
new
goddess
are
built
in
every
little
hamlet
the
intensity
with
which
the
plays
take
hold
of
the
audience
can
not
remain
without
strong
social
effects
it
has
even
been
reported
that
sensory
hallucinations
and
illusions
have
crept
in
neurasthenic
persons
are
especially
inclined
to
experience
touch
or
temperature
or
smell
or
sound
impressions
from
what
they
see
on
the
screen
the
associations
become
as
vivid
as
realities
because
the
mind
is
so
completely
given
up
to
the
moving
pictures
the
applause
into
which
the
audiences
especially
of
rural
communities
break
out
at
a
happy
turn
of
the
melodramatic
pictures
is
another
symptom
of
the
strange
fascination
but
it
is
evident
that
such
a
penetrating
influence
must
be
fraught
with
dangers
the
more
vividly
the
impressions
force
themselves
on
the
mind
the
more
easily
must
they
become
starting
points
for
imitation
and
other
motor
responses
the
sight
of
crime
and
of
vice
may
force
itself
on
the
consciousness
with
disastrous
results
the
normal
resistance
breaks
down
and
the
moral
balance
which
would
have
been
kept
under
the
habitual
stimuli
of
the
narrow
routine
life
may
be
lost
under
the
pressure
of
the
realistic
suggestions
at
the
same
time
the
subtle
sensitiveness
of
the
young
mind
may
suffer
from
the
rude
contrasts
between
the
farces
and
the
passionate
romances
which
follow
with
benumbing
speed
in
the
darkened
house
the
possibilities
of
psychical
infection
and
destruction
can
not
be
overlooked
those
may
have
been
exceptional
cases
only
when
grave
crimes
have
been
traced
directly
back
to
the
impulses
from
unwholesome
photoplays
but
no
psychologist
can
determine
exactly
how
much
the
general
spirit
of
righteousness
of
honesty
of
sexual
cleanliness
and
modesty
may
be
weakened
by
the
unbridled
influence
of
plays
of
low
moral
standard
all
countries
seem
to
have
been
awakened
to
this
social
danger
the
time
when
unsavory
french
comedies
poisoned
youth
lies
behind
us
a
strong
reaction
has
set
in
and
the
leading
companies
among
the
photoplay
producers
fight
everywhere
in
the
first
rank
for
suppression
of
the
unclean
some
companies
even
welcome
censorship
provided
that
it
is
and
liberal
and
does
not
confuse
artistic
freedom
with
moral
licentiousness
most
to
be
sure
seem
doubtful
whether
the
new
movement
toward
federal
censorship
is
in
harmony
with
american
ideas
on
the
freedom
of
public
expression
but
while
the
sources
of
danger
can
not
be
overlooked
the
social
reformer
ought
to
focus
his
interest
still
more
on
the
tremendous
influences
for
good
which
may
be
exerted
by
the
moving
pictures
the
fact
that
millions
are
daily
under
the
spell
of
the
performances
on
the
screen
is
established
the
high
degree
of
their
suggestibility
during
those
hours
in
the
dark
house
may
be
taken
for
granted
hence
any
wholesome
influence
emanating
from
the
photoplay
must
have
an
incomparable
power
for
the
remolding
and
upbuilding
of
the
national
soul
from
this
point
of
view
the
boundary
lines
between
the
photoplay
and
the
merely
instructive
moving
pictures
with
the
news
of
the
day
or
the
magazine
articles
on
the
screen
become
effaced
the
intellectual
the
moral
the
social
and
the
esthetic
culture
of
the
community
may
be
served
by
all
of
them
leading
educators
have
joined
in
endorsing
the
foundation
of
a
universal
culture
lyceum
the
plan
is
to
make
and
circulate
moving
pictures
for
the
education
of
the
youth
of
the
land
picture
studies
in
science
history
religion
literature
geography
biography
art
architecture
social
science
economics
and
industry
from
this
lyceum
schools
churches
and
colleges
will
be
furnished
with
motion
pictures
giving
the
latest
results
and
activities
in
every
sphere
capable
of
being
pictured
but
however
much
may
be
achieved
by
such
conscious
efforts
toward
education
the
far
larger
contribution
must
be
made
by
the
regular
picture
houses
which
the
public
seeks
without
being
conscious
of
the
educational
significance
the
teaching
of
the
moving
pictures
must
not
be
forced
on
a
more
or
less
indifferent
audience
but
ought
to
be
absorbed
by
those
who
seek
entertainment
and
enjoyment
from
the
films
and
are
ready
to
make
their
little
economic
sacrifice
the
purely
intellectual
part
of
this
uplift
is
the
easiest
not
only
the
news
pictures
and
the
scientific
demonstrations
but
also
the
photoplays
can
lead
young
and
old
to
ever
new
regions
of
knowledge
the
curiosity
and
the
imagination
of
the
spectators
will
follow
gladly
yet
even
in
the
intellectual
sphere
the
dangers
must
not
be
overlooked
they
are
not
positive
it
is
not
as
in
the
moral
sphere
where
the
healthy
moral
impulse
is
checked
by
the
sight
of
crimes
which
stir
up
antisocial
desires
the
danger
is
not
that
the
pictures
open
insight
into
facts
which
ought
not
to
be
known
it
is
not
the
dangerous
knowledge
which
must
be
avoided
but
it
is
the
trivializing
influence
of
a
steady
contact
with
things
which
are
not
worth
knowing
the
larger
part
of
the
film
literature
of
today
is
certainly
harmful
in
this
sense
the
intellectual
background
of
most
photoplays
is
insipid
by
telling
the
plot
without
the
subtle
motivation
which
the
spoken
word
of
the
drama
may
bring
not
only
do
the
characters
lose
color
but
all
the
scenes
and
situations
are
simplified
to
a
degree
which
adjusts
them
to
a
thoughtless
public
and
soon
becomes
intolerable
to
an
intellectually
trained
spectator
they
force
on
the
cultivated
mind
that
feeling
which
musical
persons
experience
in
the
musical
comedies
of
the
day
we
hear
the
melodies
constantly
with
the
feeling
of
having
heard
them
ever
so
often
before
this
lack
of
originality
and
inspiration
is
not
necessary
it
does
not
lie
in
the
art
form
offenbach
and
strauss
and
others
have
written
musical
comedies
which
are
classical
neither
does
it
lie
in
the
form
of
the
photoplay
that
the
story
must
be
told
in
that
insipid
flat
uninspired
fashion
nor
is
it
necessary
in
order
to
reach
the
millions
to
appeal
to
the
intelligence
does
not
mean
to
presuppose
college
education
moreover
the
differentiation
has
already
begun
just
as
the
plays
of
shaw
or
ibsen
address
a
different
audience
from
that
reached
by
the
old
homestead
or
ben
hur
we
have
already
photoplays
adapted
to
different
types
and
there
is
not
the
slightest
reason
to
connect
with
the
art
of
the
screen
an
intellectual
flabbiness
it
would
be
no
gain
for
intellectual
culture
if
all
the
reasoning
were
confined
to
the
instructive
pictures
and
the
photoplays
were
served
without
any
intellectual
salt
on
the
contrary
the
appeal
of
those
strictly
educational
lessons
may
be
less
deep
than
the
producers
hope
because
the
untrained
minds
especially
of
youth
and
of
the
uneducated
audiences
have
considerable
difficulty
in
following
the
rapid
flight
of
events
when
they
occur
in
unfamiliar
surroundings
the
child
grasps
very
little
in
seeing
the
happenings
in
a
factory
the
psychological
and
economic
lesson
may
be
rather
wasted
because
the
power
of
observation
is
not
sufficiently
developed
and
the
assimilation
proceeds
too
slowly
but
it
is
quite
different
when
a
human
interest
stands
behind
it
and
connects
the
events
in
the
photoplay
the
difficulties
in
the
way
of
the
right
moral
influence
are
still
greater
than
in
the
intellectual
field
certainly
it
is
not
enough
to
have
the
villain
punished
in
the
last
few
pictures
of
the
reel
if
scenes
of
vice
or
crime
are
shown
with
all
their
lure
and
glamour
the
moral
devastation
of
such
a
suggestive
show
is
not
undone
by
the
appended
social
reaction
the
misguided
boys
or
girls
feel
sure
that
they
would
be
successful
enough
not
to
be
trapped
the
mind
through
a
mechanism
which
has
been
understood
better
and
better
by
the
psychologists
in
recent
years
suppresses
the
ideas
which
are
contrary
to
the
secret
wishes
and
makes
those
ideas
flourish
by
which
those
subconscious
impulses
are
fulfilled
it
is
probably
a
strong
exaggeration
when
a
prominent
criminologist
recently
claimed
that
per
cent
of
the
juvenile
crime
which
has
been
investigated
has
been
found
traceable
either
directly
or
indirectly
to
motion
pictures
which
have
shown
on
the
screen
how
crimes
could
be
committed
but
certainly
as
far
as
these
demonstrations
have
worked
havoc
their
influence
would
not
have
been
annihilated
by
a
picturesque
court
scene
in
which
the
burglar
is
unsuccessful
in
misleading
the
jury
the
true
moral
influence
must
come
from
the
positive
spirit
of
the
play
itself
even
the
photodramatic
lessons
in
temperance
and
piety
will
not
rebuild
a
frivolous
or
corrupt
or
perverse
community
the
truly
upbuilding
play
is
not
a
dramatized
sermon
on
morality
and
religion
there
must
be
a
moral
wholesomeness
in
the
whole
setting
a
moral
atmosphere
which
is
taken
as
a
matter
of
course
like
fresh
air
and
sunlight
an
enthusiasm
for
the
noble
and
uplifting
a
belief
in
duty
and
discipline
of
the
mind
a
faith
in
ideals
and
eternal
values
must
permeate
the
world
of
the
screen
if
it
does
there
is
no
crime
and
no
heinous
deed
which
the
photoplay
may
not
tell
with
frankness
and
sincerity
it
is
not
necessary
to
deny
evil
and
sin
in
order
to
strengthen
the
consciousness
of
eternal
justice
but
the
greatest
mission
which
the
photoplay
may
have
in
our
community
is
that
of
esthetic
cultivation
no
art
reaches
a
larger
audience
daily
no
esthetic
influence
finds
spectators
in
a
more
receptive
frame
of
mind
on
the
other
hand
no
training
demands
a
more
persistent
and
planful
arousing
of
the
mind
than
the
esthetic
training
and
never
is
progress
more
difficult
than
when
the
teacher
adjusts
himself
to
the
mere
liking
of
the
pupils
the
country
today
would
still
be
without
any
symphony
concerts
and
operas
if
it
had
only
received
what
the
audiences
believed
at
the
moment
that
they
liked
best
the
esthetically
commonplace
will
always
triumph
over
the
significant
unless
systematic
efforts
are
made
to
reënforce
the
work
of
true
beauty
communities
at
first
always
prefer
sousa
to
beethoven
the
moving
picture
audience
could
only
by
slow
steps
be
brought
from
the
tasteless
and
vulgar
eccentricities
of
the
first
period
to
the
best
plays
of
today
and
the
best
plays
of
today
can
be
nothing
but
the
beginning
of
the
great
upward
movement
which
we
hope
for
in
the
photoplay
hardly
any
teaching
can
mean
more
for
our
community
than
the
teaching
of
beauty
where
it
reaches
the
masses
the
moral
impulse
and
the
desire
for
knowledge
are
after
all
deeply
implanted
in
the
american
crowd
but
the
longing
for
beauty
is
rudimentary
and
yet
it
means
harmony
unity
true
satisfaction
and
happiness
in
life
the
people
still
has
to
learn
the
great
difference
between
true
enjoyment
and
fleeting
pleasure
between
real
beauty
and
the
mere
tickling
of
the
senses
of
course
there
are
those
and
they
may
be
legion
today
who
would
deride
every
plan
to
make
the
moving
pictures
the
vehicle
of
esthetic
education
how
can
we
teach
the
spirit
of
true
art
by
a
medium
which
is
in
itself
the
opposite
of
art
how
can
we
implant
the
idea
of
harmony
by
that
which
is
in
itself
a
parody
on
art
we
hear
the
contempt
for
canned
drama
and
the
theater
nobody
stops
to
think
whether
other
arts
despise
the
help
of
technique
the
printed
book
of
lyric
poems
is
also
the
marble
bust
has
also
preserved
for
two
thousand
years
the
beauty
of
the
living
woman
who
was
the
model
for
the
greek
sculptor
they
tell
us
that
the
actor
on
the
stage
gives
the
human
beings
as
they
are
in
reality
but
the
moving
pictures
are
unreal
and
therefore
of
incomparably
inferior
value
they
do
not
consider
that
the
roses
of
the
summer
which
we
enjoy
in
the
stanzas
of
the
poet
do
not
exist
in
reality
in
the
forms
of
iambic
verse
and
of
rhymes
they
live
in
color
and
odor
but
their
color
and
odor
fade
away
while
the
roses
in
the
stanzas
live
on
forever
they
fancy
that
the
value
of
an
art
depends
upon
its
nearness
to
the
reality
of
physical
nature
it
has
been
the
chief
task
of
our
whole
discussion
to
prove
the
shallowness
of
such
arguments
and
objections
we
recognized
that
art
is
a
way
to
overcome
nature
and
to
create
out
of
the
chaotic
material
of
the
world
something
entirely
new
entirely
unreal
which
embodies
perfect
unity
and
harmony
the
different
arts
are
different
ways
of
abstracting
from
reality
and
when
we
began
to
analyze
the
psychology
of
the
moving
pictures
we
soon
became
aware
that
the
photoplay
has
a
way
to
perform
this
task
of
art
with
entire
originality
independent
of
the
art
of
the
theater
as
much
as
poetry
is
independent
of
music
or
sculpture
of
painting
it
is
an
art
in
itself
only
the
future
can
teach
us
whether
it
will
become
a
great
art
whether
a
leonardo
a
shakespeare
a
mozart
will
ever
be
born
for
it
nobody
can
foresee
the
directions
which
the
new
art
may
take
mere
esthetic
insight
into
the
principles
can
never
foreshadow
the
development
in
the
unfolding
of
civilization
who
would
have
been
bold
enough
four
centuries
ago
to
foresee
the
musical
means
and
effects
of
the
modern
orchestra
just
the
history
of
music
shows
how
the
inventive
genius
has
always
had
to
blaze
the
path
in
which
the
routine
work
of
the
art
followed
tone
combinations
which
appeared
intolerable
dissonances
to
one
generation
were
again
and
again
assimilated
and
welcomed
and
finally
accepted
as
a
matter
of
course
by
later
times
nobody
can
foresee
the
ways
which
the
new
art
of
the
photoplay
will
open
but
everybody
ought
to
recognize
even
today
that
it
is
worth
while
to
help
this
advance
and
to
make
the
art
of
the
film
a
medium
for
an
original
creative
expression
of
our
time
and
to
mold
by
it
the
esthetic
instincts
of
the
millions
yes
it
is
a
new
art
and
this
is
why
it
has
such
fascination
for
the
psychologist
who
in
a
world
of
arts
each
with
a
history
of
many
centuries
suddenly
finds
a
new
form
still
undeveloped
and
hardly
understood
for
the
first
time
the
psychologist
can
observe
the
starting
of
an
entirely
new
esthetic
development
a
new
form
of
true
beauty
in
the
turmoil
of
a
technical
age
created
by
its
very
technique
and
yet
more
than
any
other
art
destined
to
overcome
outer
nature
by
the
free
and
joyful
play
of
the
mind
