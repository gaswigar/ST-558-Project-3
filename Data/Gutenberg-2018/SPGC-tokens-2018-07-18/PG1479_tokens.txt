i
dedicate
this
short
account
of
a
vanished
arcadia
to
the
author
of
teresa
her
life
and
times
being
certain
that
the
life
of
all
saints
is
to
them
and
us
an
arcadia
unknown
to
them
and
to
us
vanished
with
their
lives
yet
still
remembered
fitfully
as
are
the
jesuits
in
paraguay
by
a
few
faithful
when
the
angelus
wakes
recollection
in
the
indians
hearts
but
then
the
angelus
even
of
memory
is
to
the
most
part

only
a
jangling

antiquated

preface
nascitur
non
fit
i
am
painfully
aware
that
neither
my
calling
nor
election
in
this
matter
are
the
least
sure
certain
it
is
that
in
youth
when
alone
the
historian
or
the
horseman
may
be
formed
i
did
little
to
fit
myself
for
writing
history
wandering
about
the
countries
of
which
now
i
treat
i
had
almost
as
little
object
in
my
travels
as
a
gaucho
of
the
outside
i
never
took
a
note
on
any
subject
under
heaven
nor
kept
a
diary
by
means
of
which
my
youth
departed
and
the
countries
i
once
knew
so
well
transmogrified
i
could
sitting
beside
the
fire
read
and
enjoy
the
sadness
of
revisiting
in
my
mind
eye
scenes
that
i
now
remember
indistinctly
as
in
a
dream
i
take
it
that
he
who
keeps
a
journal
of
his
doings
setting
down
day
by
day
all
that
he
does
with
dates
and
names
of
places
their
longitude
and
latitude
duly
recorded
makes
for
himself
a
meal
of
and
that
your
truest
dulcamara
is
to
read
with
glasses
the
faded
notes
jotted
down
hurriedly
in
rain
in
sun
in
wind
in
camps
by
flooded
rivers
and
in
the
long
and
listless
hours
of
heat
in
fact
to
see
again
your
life
as
it
were
acted
for
you
in
some
camera
obscura
with
the
chief
actor
changed
but
diaries
unless
they
be
mere
records
of
bare
facts
must
of
necessity
as
in
their
nature
they
are
autobiographical
be
false
guides
so
that
perhaps
i
in
my
carelessness
was
not
quite
so
unwise
as
i
have
often
thought
myself
although
i
made
no
notes
of
anything
caring
most
chiefly
for
the
condition
of
my
horse
yet
when
i
think
on
them
pampa
and
cordillera
virgin
forest
the
of
the
rivers
approached
by
sandy
paths
bordered
by
flowering
and
trees
and
most
of
all
the
deserted
jesuit
missions
half
buried
by
the
vigorous
vegetation
and
peopled
but
by
a
few
indians
rise
up
so
clearly
that
without
the
smallest
faculty
for
dealing
with
that
which
i
have
undertaken
i
am
forced
to
write
flowers
scents
the
herds
of
horses
the
ostriches
and
the
whole
charm
of
that
new
world
which
those
who
saw
it
even
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
saw
little
altered
from
the
remotest
times
have
remained
clear
and
sharp
and
will
remain
so
with
me
to
the
end
so
to
the
readers
if
i
chance
to
have
them
of
this
short
attempt
to
give
some
faint
idea
of
the
great
christian
commonwealth
of
the
jesuit
missions
between
the
parana
and
uruguay
i
now
address
myself
he
who
attacks
a
subject
quite
fallen
out
of
date
and
still
not
old
enough
to
give
a
man
authority
to
speak
upon
it
without
the
fear
of
contradiction
runs
grave
risk
gentle
indulgent
reader
if
so
be
that
you
exist
in
these
the
days
of
universal
knowledge
and
criticism
i
do
not
ask
for
your
indulgence
for
the
many
errors
which
no
doubt
have
slipped
into
this
work
these
if
you
care
to
take
the
trouble
you
can
verify
and
hold
me
up
to
shame
what
i
do
crave
is
that
you
will
approach
the
subject
with
an
open
mind
your
jesuit
is
as
we
know
the
most
tremendous
that
the
world
has
known
guardia
nera
of
the
pope
the
order
which
has
wrought
so
much
destruction
the
inventors
of
media
cradle
from
which
has
issued
forth
molina
suarez
and
all
those
villains
who
in
the
days
in
which
the
doctrine
was
unfashionable
decried
mere
faith
and
took
their
stand
on
works
who
in
this
land
of
preconceived
opinion
can
spare
it
a
good
word
but
notwithstanding
even
a
jansenist
if
such
be
left
must
yet
admit
the
claim
of
francis
xavier
as
a
true
humble
saint
and
if
the
sectary
of
port
royale
should
refuse
all
men
of
letters
must
perforce
revere
the
writer
of
the
hymn
the
doctrine
of
the
media
occurs
in
the
celebrated
gratiae
et
liberi
arbitrii
by
luis
de
molina
the
concilium
de
auxiliis
was
held
to
determine
whether
or
not
was
possible
between
freewill
and
grace
as
the
jesuits
stuck
by
molina
and
his
doctrines
in
despite
of
councils
and
of
popes
the
common
saying
arose
in
spain
en
la
pasteleria
y
ciencia
media
en
la
but
into
the
whole
question
of
the
jesuits
i
can
not
enter
as
it
entails
command
of
far
more
foot
and
words
than
i
can
muster
up
still
in
america
and
most
of
all
in
paraguay
i
hope
to
show
the
order
did
much
good
and
worked
amongst
the
indians
like
apostles
receiving
an
apostle
true
reward
of
calumny
of
stripes
of
blows
and
journeying
hungry
athirst
on
foot
in
perils
oft
from
the
great
cataract
of
the
parana
to
the
recesses
of
the
tarumensian
woods
little
enough
i
personally
care
for
the
political
aspect
of
their
commonwealth
or
how
it
acted
on
the
spanish
settlements
of
whether
or
not
it
turned
out
profitable
to
the
court
of
spain
or
if
the
crimes
and
charges
of
ambition
laid
to
the
jesuits
account
were
false
or
true
my
only
interest
in
the
matter
is
how
the
jesuits
rule
acted
upon
the
indians
themselves
and
if
it
made
them
happy
more
happy
or
less
happy
than
those
indians
who
were
directly
ruled
from
spain
or
through
the
spanish
governors
of
the
viceroyalties
for
theories
of
advancement
and
as
to
whether
certain
arbitrary
ideas
of
the
rights
of
man
evolved
in
general
by
those
who
in
their
persons
and
their
lives
are
the
negation
of
all
rights
i
give
a
fico
yes
your
fig
of
spain
caring
as
little
as
did
ancient
pistol
for
and
holding
that
the
best
right
that
a
man
can
have
is
to
be
happy
after
the
way
that
pleases
him
the
most
and
that
the
jesuits
rendered
the
indians
happy
is
certain
though
to
those
men
who
fudge
a
theory
of
mankind
thinking
that
everyone
is
forged
upon
their
anvil
or
run
out
of
their
own
mould
after
the
fashion
of
a
tallow
dip
a
theory
which
indeed
the
sameness
of
mankind
renders
at
times
not
quite
untenable
it
seems
absurd
because
the
progress
of
the
world
has
gone
on
other
lines
lines
which
prolonged
indefinitely
would
never
meet
those
which
the
jesuits
drew
all
that
i
know
is
i
myself
in
the
deserted
missions
years
ago
often
have
met
old
men
who
spoke
regretfully
of
jesuit
times
who
cherished
all
the
customs
left
by
the
company
and
though
they
spoke
at
secondhand
repeating
but
the
stories
they
had
heard
in
youth
kept
the
illusion
that
the
missions
in
the
jesuits
time
had
been
a
paradise
into
the
matter
of
the
jesuits
motives
i
do
not
propose
to
enter
holding
that
the
origin
of
motives
is
too
deeply
seated
to
be
worth
inquiry
until
one
has
more
information
about
the
human
mind
than
even
modern
seem
able
to
impart
yet
it
is
certain
the
jesuits
in
paraguay
had
faith
fit
to
remove
all
mountains
as
the
brief
stories
of
their
lives
so
often
ending
with
a
rude
by
the
corner
of
some
forest
and
the
inscription
occissus
survive
to
show
some
men
such
is
the
complexity
of
human
nature
have
undergone
trials
and
persecutions
for
base
motives
and
it
is
open
for
anyone
to
say
the
jesuits
as
they
were
jesuits
could
do
nothing
good
still
i
believe
that
father
ruiz
montoya
whose
story
i
have
told
how
falteringly
and
with
how
little
justice
to
his
greatness
none
knows
better
than
myself
was
a
good
man
that
is
a
man
without
ulterior
motives
and
actuated
but
by
his
love
to
the
poor
indians
with
whom
he
passed
his
life
when
no
one
can
see
good
in
anything
or
anybody
outside
the
somewhat
beefy
pale
of
the
race
i
do
not
hope
that
such
a
mere
dabbler
in
the
great
mystery
of
history
as
i
am
myself
will
for
an
instant
change
one
preconceived
opinion
for
i
am
well
aware
that
speeches
based
on
facts
are
impotent
in
popular
assemblies
to
change
a
single
vote
it
is
an
article
of
faith
that
all
the
spanish
colonies
were
and
all
the
spanish
conquerors
bloodthirsty
butchers
whose
sole
delight
was
blood
this
too
from
the
members
of
a
race
who
but
the
multitude
of
the
greyhounds
is
the
undoing
of
the
hare
therefore
i
ask
those
who
imagine
that
all
spaniards
at
the
conquest
of
america
were
ruffians
to
consider
the
career
of
alvar
nunez
who
also
struts
through
his
brief
chapter
in
the
pages
of
my
most
imperfect
book
still
i
admit
men
of
the
stamp
of
alvar
nunez
are
most
rare
and
were
still
rarer
in
the
sixteenth
century
and
to
find
many
of
the
ruiz
montoya
brand
diogenes
would
have
needed
a
lantern
fitted
with
electric
light
in
the
great
controversy
which
engaged
the
pens
of
many
of
the
best
writers
of
the
world
last
century
after
the
jesuits
were
expelled
from
spain
and
her
colonial
possessions
then
almost
half
the
world
it
will
be
found
that
amongst
all
the
mud
so
freely
flung
about
the
insults
given
and
received
hardly
anyone
but
a
few
had
any
harm
to
say
of
the
doings
of
the
order
during
its
long
rule
in
paraguay
none
of
the
jesuits
were
ever
tried
no
crimes
were
charged
against
them
even
the
reasons
for
their
expulsion
were
never
given
to
the
world
at
large
certain
it
is
that
but
a
few
years
after
their
final
exit
from
the
missions
between
the
uruguay
and
parana
all
was
confusion
in
twenty
years
most
of
the
missions
were
deserted
and
before
thirty
years
had
passed
no
vestige
of
their
old
prosperity
remained
the
which
the
jesuits
had
introduced
was
swept
away
and
the
keen
light
of
free
and
vivifying
competition
which
beats
so
fiercely
upon
the
bagman
paradise
of
the
economists
reigned
in
its
stead
the
revenues
declined
all
was
corruption
and
as
the
governor
don
juan
jose
vertiz
writes
to
the
viceroy
the
secular
priests
sent
by
the
government
were
brawlers
drunkards
and
strikers
carrying
arms
beneath
their
cloaks
that
robbery
was
rife
and
that
the
indians
daily
deserted
and
returned
by
hundreds
to
the
woods
dean
funes
de
la
historia
civil
del
paraguay
buenos
aires
idem
the
letter
is
dated
and
the
jesuits
were
expelled
in
as
the
writer
of
the
letter
was
on
the
spot
in
an
official
position
and
nominated
by
the
very
viceroy
who
had
been
the
expeller
of
the
jesuits
his
testimony
would
seem
to
be
as
valuable
as
that
of
the
ablest
theorist
on
government
catholic
or
protestant
who
ever
wrote
all
the
reports
of
riches
amassed
in
paraguay
by
the
jesuits
after
the
expulsion
of
their
order
proved
to
be
untrue
nothing
of
any
consequence
was
found
in
any
of
the
towns
although
the
jesuits
had
had
no
warning
of
their
expulsion
and
had
no
time
for
preparation
or
for
concealment
of
their
gold
although
they
stood
to
the
indians
almost
in
the
light
of
gods
and
had
control
of
an
armed
force
larger
by
far
than
any
which
the
temporal
power
could
have
disposed
of
they
did
not
resist
but
silently
departed
from
the
rich
territories
which
their
care
and
industry
had
formed
rightly
or
wrongly
but
according
to
their
lights
they
strove
to
teach
the
indian
population
all
the
best
part
of
the
european
progress
of
the
times
in
which
they
lived
shielding
them
sedulously
from
all
contact
with
commercialism
and
standing
between
them
and
the
spanish
settlers
who
would
have
treated
them
as
slaves
these
were
their
crimes
for
their
ambitions
who
shall
search
the
human
heart
or
say
what
their
superiors
in
europe
may
or
perhaps
may
not
have
had
in
view
when
all
is
said
and
done
and
now
their
work
is
over
and
all
they
worked
for
lost
as
happens
usually
with
the
efforts
of
disinterested
men
what
crime
so
terrible
can
men
commit
as
to
stand
up
for
near
upon
two
centuries
against
that
slavery
which
disgraced
every
american
possession
of
the
crown
nothing
is
bad
enough
for
those
who
dare
to
speak
the
truth
and
those
who
put
their
theories
into
practice
are
a
disgrace
to
progressive
and
adequately
taxed
communities
nearly
two
hundred
years
they
strove
and
now
their
territories
once
so
populous
and
so
well
cultivated
remain
if
not
a
desert
yet
delivered
up
to
that
subtropical
american
plant
life
which
seems
as
if
it
fights
with
man
for
the
possession
of
the
land
in
which
it
grows
for
a
brief
period
those
guaranis
gathered
together
in
the
missions
ruled
over
by
their
priests
treated
like
children
yet
with
a
kindness
which
attached
them
to
their
rulers
enjoyed
a
life
reaching
to
just
so
much
of
what
the
world
calls
civilization
as
they
could
profit
by
and
use
with
pleasure
to
themselves
a
commonwealth
where
money
was
unknown
to
the
majority
of
the
citizens
a
curious
experiment
by
men
a
sort
of
dropping
down
a
in
the
flood
of
progress
to
keep
alive
a
population
which
would
otherwise
soon
have
been
suffocated
in
its
muddy
waves
was
doomed
to
failure
by
the
very
nature
of
mankind
foredoomed
to
failure
it
has
disappeared
leaving
nothing
of
a
like
nature
now
upon
the
earth
the
indians
too
have
vanished
gone
to
that
limbo
which
no
doubt
is
fitted
for
them
gentle
indulgent
reader
if
you
read
this
book
doubt
not
an
instant
that
everything
that
happens
happens
for
the
best
doubt
not
for
in
so
doing
you
would
doubt
of
all
you
see
our
life
our
progress
and
your
own
infallibility
which
at
all
hazards
must
be
kept
inviolate
therefore
in
my
imperfect
sketch
i
have
not
dwelt
entirely
on
the
strict
concatenation
after
the
bradshaw
fashion
of
the
hard
facts
of
the
history
of
the
jesuits
i
have
not
set
down
too
many
dates
for
the
setting
down
of
dates
in
much
profusion
is
after
all
an
ad
captandum
appeal
to
the
suffrages
of
those
creatures
who
are
styled
serious
men
this
of
course
applies
to
the
possessions
of
all
european
states
in
america
equally
with
spain
wandering
along
the
of
the

the

man
in

to
the

from
the

of

till
a
relatively
short
time
ago
all
the
really
great
work
done
by

seemed
to
have
been
forgotten
and
every
vulgar
fable
which
it

to

pascal
confesses
in

postscript
to
the
ninth
provincial
letter
that
having
written
my
letter
i
read
the
works
of
fathers
barry
and
binet
if
such
a
man
as
pascal
could
be
so
grossly
unfair
as
to
write
a
criticism
on
works
which
he
had
not
read
what
can
be
expected
from
the
and
uncritical
public
which
takes
all
upon
trust
from
japan
to
the
interior
of
bolivia
there
is
scarcely
a
country
in
which
the
jesuits
have
not
laboured
assiduously
and
in
which
they
have
not
shed
their
blood
freely
without
hope
of
reward
yet
it
would
require
much
time
and
a
lengthy
catalogue
to
enumerate
the
list
of
satirical
and
calumnious
works
which
have
appeared
against
them
in
almost
every
language
in
europe
of
these
perhaps
the
most
celebrated
is
the
de
los
solipsos
by
padre
melchior
inshoffer
an
who
describes
the
company
in
the
worst
possible
terms
it
is
interesting
chiefly
on
account
of
the
portraits
of
people
of
the
time
to
as
pope
clement
francisco
suarez
claudio
aquaviva
and
others
veiled
under
easily
distinguishable
pseudonyms
the
object
of
the
writer
as
the
title
indicates
is
to
show
that
the
jesuits
endeavoured
to
turn
all
to
their
own
profit
in
this
if
it
was
the
case
they
do
not
seem
to
have
been
greatly
different
from
every
other
associated
body
of
men
whether
lay
or
clerical
the
celebrated
spanish
proverb
y
se
ahorca
cuenta
le
hace
meaning
even
if
a
jesuit
is
hung
he
gets
some
good
out
of
it
may
just
as
well
be
applied
to
members
of
other
learned
professions
as
to
the
jesuits
madrid
the
world
has
rarely
persecuted
any
body
of
men
conspicuous
by
its
poverty
or
if
it
has
done
so
has

the

but
then

and
is
a
common
saying
in
spain
as
in
the
case
of
the
templars
persecution

began
against
the
jesuits
when
it
became
worth

to
persecute
them
ignatius
loyola
francisco
xavier
and
diego
lainez
as
long
as
they
confined
themselves
to

and
to
teaching
were
safe
enough
even
the
annals
of
theological
strife
bloodthirsty
and
discreditable
to
humanity
as
they
are
contain
few
examples
of
persecutors
such
as
calvin
or
torquemada
to
whom
ruthless
as
they
were
in
their
savage
and
narrow
malignity
and
zeal
for
what
they
thought
the
truth
no
suspicion
of
venal
motives
is
attributed
of
the
jesuits
intrigues
adventures
rise
and
fall
in
europe
much
may
be
said
in
attack
or
in
extenuation
but
it
is
not
the
intention
of
the
present
work
to
deal
with
this
aspect
of
the
question
it
was
in
spanish
america
and
especially
in
paraguay
and
bolivia
where
the
policy
of
the
company
in
regard
to
savage
nations
was
most
fully
developed
as
it
was
only
the
jesuits
who
ever
succeeded
in
reclaiming
any
large
number
of
the
nomad
or
tribes
of
those
countries
many
excellent
works
in
french
and
the
celebrated
felice
nel
paraguay
of
the
abbate
muratori
in
italian
certainly
exist
but
neither
father
charlevoix
the
french
historian
of
the
missions
nor
muratori
was
ever
in
paraguay
and
both
their
books
contain
the
faults
and
mistakes
of
men
however
excellent
and
well
intentioned
writing
of
countries
of
which
they
were
personally
ignorant
both
give
a
good
account
of
the
customs
and
regimen
of
the
missions
but
both
seem
to
have
believed
too
readily
fabulous
accounts
of
the
flora
and
fauna
of
paraguay
the
fact
of
having
listened
too
readily
to
a
fable
about
an
unknown
animal
in
no
way
detracts
from
the
general
veracity
of
an
author
of
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
for
in
all
other
respects
except
natural
history
charlevoix
keeps
within
the
bounds
of
probability
though
of
course
as
a
jesuit
he
holds
a
brief
for
the
doings
of
the
company
in
paraguay
muratori
is
more
rarely
led
into
extravagances
but
is
concerned
in
the
main
with
the
religious
side
of
the
jesuits
as
the
title
of
his
book
indicates
though
in
this
respect
charlevoix
is
not
so
credulous
as
padre
ruiz
de
montoya
and
the
older
writers
he
yet
repeats
the
story
of
the
bird
that
cleans
the
alligator
teeth
the
magic
virtues
of
the
tapir
nails
and
many
others
see
charlevoix
vol
bk
paris
the
story
of
the
bird
that
cleans
the
teeth
of
alligators
is
very
nearly
true
aegyptius
has
a
symbiotic
relationship
with
crocodiles
in
parts
of
africa
and
similar
relationships
exist
throughout
the
natural
world
many
other
french
writers
as
raynal
montesquieu
and
voltaire
have
treated
of
paraguay
under
jesuit
rule
but
their
writings
are
founded
on
hearsay
evidence
a
german
father
dobrizhoffer
stands
alone
his
delightful
of
the
abipones
an
equestrian
people
of
paraguay
is
perhaps
the
most
charming
book
dealing
with
the
subject
a
simple
and
easy
style
a
keen
habit
of
observation
long
acquaintance
with
the
country
a
zeal
for
the
conversion
of
the
infidel
not
only
to
christianity
but
to
a
more
comfortable
mode
of
life
to
which
he
adds
a
faith
sufficient
to
move
the
cordillera
of
the
andes
but
at
the
same
time
restricted
by
a
and
veracity
not
always
observable
in
religious
writers
render

personal
friend
after
the
perusal
of
his
writings

title
of

by

at

in

is
singularly
barren
in

to
the
jesuits
in

father
falconer
an
english
jesuit
has
left
a
curious
and
interesting
book
printed
at
hereford
in
but
he
treats
exclusively
of
what
is
now
the
province
of
buenos
ayres
the
falkland
islands
and
of
patagonia
as
an
englishman
and
a
jesuit
a
somewhat
rare
combination
in
the
eighteenth
century
and
as
one
who
doubtless
knew
many
of
the
paraguayan
priests
his
testimony
would
have
been
most
important
especially
as
he
was
a
man
of
great
information
much
education
an
intrepid
traveller
and
moreover
only
entered
the
company
of
jesus
at
a
comparatively
advanced
age
it
is
in
spanish
or
in
latin
by
spanish
authors
that
the
greater
portion
of
the
contemporary
histories
and
accounts
are
to
be
found
literatures
like
other
things
have
their
times
of
fashion
at
one
time
a
knowledge
of
spanish
was
as
requisite
as
some
tincture
of
french
is
at
present
and
almost
as
universal

in
the

portion
of
the
century
ticknor
prescott
and
washington
irving
rendered
spanish
literature
fashionable
to
some
degree
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
the
spanish
colonists
were
as
a
rule
antagonistic
to
the
jesuits
and
that
therefore
spanish
writers
do
not
of
necessity
hold

brief
for

later
the

drew
some
attention
to
it
hardly
any
literature
of
europe
is
so
little
studied
in
england
still
leaving
apart
the
purely
literary
treasures
of
the
language
it
is
in
spanish
and
almost
alone
in
spanish
that
the
early
history
of
america
is
to
be
found
after
the
struggle
for
independence
which
finished
about
some
interest
was
excited
in
the
countries
stimulated
by
the
writings
of
humboldt
but
when
it
became
apparent
that
on
the
whole
those
countries
could
never
be
occupied
by
northern
europeans
interest
in
them
died
out
except
for
purposes
connected
with
the
stock
exchange
yet
there
is
a
charm
which
attaches
to
them
which
attaches
to
no
other
countries
in
the
world
it
was
there
that
one
of
the
greatest
dramas
and
certainly
the
greatest
adventure
in
which
the
human
race
has
engaged
took
place
what
africa
has
been
for
the
last
twenty
years
spanish
america
was
three
hundred
years
ago
the
difference
being
that
whereas
modern
adventure
in
africa
goes
on
under
full
observation
and
deals
in
the
main
with
absolutely
uncivilized
peoples
the
conquest
of
south
america
was
invested
with
all
the
charm
of
novelty
and
brought
the
conquerors
into
contact
with
at
least
two
peoples
almost
as
advanced
in
most
of
the
arts
of
civilization
as
they
were
themselves
when
first
sebastian
cabot
and
solis
ascended
the
parana
they
found
that
the
guaranis
of
paraguay
had
extended
in
no
instance
to
the
western
shore
of
either
of
those
rivers
the
western
banks
were

as
now

after

second
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
certain
it
is
that
at
various
places
in
the
chaco
in
the
quaint
old
maps
the
jesuits
have
left
us
one
reads
de
santa
cruz
de
los
vilelas
de
la
concepcion
de
los
frontones
and
others
but
much
more
frequently
their
maps
are
studded
with
crosses
and
some
such
legend
as
occisi
sunt
pp
antonius
salinus
et
petrus
ortiz
zarate
it
was
only
when
the
jesuits
encountered
the
more
peaceful
guaranis
that
they
met
with
real
success
see
the
curious
map
contained
in
the
now
rare
work
of
pedro
lozano
entitled
chorographica
del
gran
chaco
gualamba
etc
also
in
the
interesting
collection
of
old
maps
published
in
at
madrid
by
francisco
javier
brabo
what
was
the
nature
of
their
success
how
durable
it
was
what
were
the
reasons
which
caused
the
expulsion
of
the
order
from
america
and
especially
from
paraguay
and
what
has
been
the
result
upon
the
remainder
of
the
indians
it
is
my
object
to
endeavour
to
explain
a
long
residence
in
the
river
plate
together
with
two
visits
to
paraguay
in
one
of
which
i
saw
almost
all
the
remnants
of
the
paraguayan
missions
and
a
few
of
those
situated
in
the
province
of
corrientes
and
in
the
brazilian
province
of
rio
grande
do
sul
have
given
me
some
personal
acquaintance
with
the
subject
it
is
of
course
to
be
taken
into
consideration
that
my
two
journeys
in
paraguay
were
made
after
the
great
war
which
terminated
in
after
lasting
four
years
but
the
writings
of
demersay
du
paraguay
et
des
des
paris
those
of
brabo
and
of
azara
show
the
deserted
state
of
the
district
of
misiones
in
the
period
from
the
date
of
the
expulsion
of
the
jesuits
to
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
actual
condition
of
the
rich
district
of
misiones
paraguay
at
the
time
i
visited
it
shortly
after
the
conclusion
of
the
great
war
between
paraguay
and
brazil
in
does
not
enable
me
to
speak
with
authority
on
the
condition
of
communities
the
guiding
spirits
of
which
were
expelled
as
far
back
as
the
year
the
actual
buildings
of
the
missions
the
churches
in
a
dismantled
state
have
indeed
survived
in
many
instances
the
tall
the
jesuits
planted
still
wave
over
them
generally
the
college
was
occupied
by
the
indian
alcalde
who
came
out
to
meet
the
visitor
on
a
horse
if
he
possessed
one
with
as
much
silver
about
the
bridle
and
stirrups
as
he
could
afford
clothed
in
white
with
a
cloak
of
red
baize
a
large
hat
and
silver
spurs
buckled
on
his
naked
feet
if
he
had
never
left
the
mission
he
talked
with
wonder
and
respect
of
the
times
of
the
jesuits
and
at
the
knelt
down
to
pray
wherever
the
sound
of
the
angelus
might
catch
him
his
children
before
bedtime
knelt
all
in
a
row
to
ask
his
blessing
if
he
had
been
to
asuncion
he
probably
remarked
that
the
people
under
those
accursed
priests
were
naught
but
animals
and
slaves
and
launched
into
some
disquisition
he
had
heard
in
the
solitary
cafe
which
asuncion
then
boasted
in
the
latter
case
after
much
of
the
rights
of
man
and
the
duties
of
hospitality
he
generally
presented
you
with
a
heavy
bill
for
indian
corn
and
which
your
horse
had
eaten
in
the
former
usually
he
bade
you
go
with
god
and
if
you
spoke
of
payment
said
send
me
a
book
of
hours
when
you
get
to
asuncion
australis
of
indians
hardly
any
were
left
to
judge
of
for
in
the
villages
in
which
according
to
the
reports
furnished
to
bucareli
the
viceroy
of
buenos
ayres
at
the
time
of
the
expulsion
of
the
jesuits
the
population
numbered
in
the
thirty
towns
of
the
missions
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
a
population
of
at
most
twenty
thousand
was
to
be
found
on
every
side
the
powerful
vegetation
had
covered
up
the
fields
on
ruined
church
and
chapel
and
on
broken
tower
the
lianas
climbed
as
if
on
trees
creeping
up
the
belfries
and
throwing
great
masses
of
scarlet
and
purple
flowers
out
of
the
apertures
where
once
were
hung
the
bells
in
the
thick
jungles
a
few
cattle
still
were
to
be
found
the
vast
where
once
the
jesuits
branded
two
and
three
thousand
calves
a
year
and
from
whence
thousands
of
mules
went
forth
to
chile
and
bolivia
were
all
neglected
horses
were
scarce
and
poor
crops
few
and
indifferent
and
the
plantations
made
by
the
jesuits
of
the
tree
paraguayensis
from
which
is
made
the
mate
were
all
destroyed
see
the
reports
of
the
marques
de
valdelirios
and
others
in
the
publications
of
francisco
javier
brabo
madrid
and
in
the
de
la
historia
civil
de
paraguay
y
tucuman
por
don
gregorio
funes
buenos
ayres
in
the
vast
forests
stretching
to
the
salto
de
guayra
a
few
scattered
tribes
known
as
caaguas
roamed
through
the
thickets
or
encamped
upon
the
streams
in
the
thirty
towns
once
full
of
life
and
stir
in
every
one
of
which
there
was
a
church
finer
as
an
old
spanish
writer
says
than
any
in
buenos
ayres
there
was
naught
but
desolation
and
despair
the
indians
either
had
returned
into
the
woods
been
killed
in
the
ceaseless
revolutionary
wars
or
had
been
absorbed
into
the
gaucho
populations
of
corrientes
rio
grande
entre
rios
and
of
santa
fe
it
may
be
that
all
indian
races
are
destined
to
disappear
if
they
come
into
contact
with
europeans
certainly
experience
would
seem
to
confirm
the
supposition
the
policy
of
the
jesuits
however
was
based
on
isolation
of
their
missions
and
how
this
might
have
worked
is
matter
at
least
for
speculation
it
was
on
account
of
the
isolation
which
they
practised
that
it
was
possible
for
the
extravagant
calumnies
which
were
circulated
as
to
their
rule
and
riches
to
gain
belief
it
was
on
account
of
isolation
that
the
first
conflicts
arose
betwixt
them
and
the
authorities
both
clerical
and
lay
that
the
jesuits
were
more
highly
esteemed
than
the
other
religious
orders
in
spanish
america
in
the
seventeenth
century
the
saying
current
in
those
days
demas
van
los
jesuitas
una
the
others
get
all
they
can
but
the
jesuits
have
one
aim
the
conversion
of
the
indians
seems
to
show
it
is
not
my
purpose
to
deal
with
the
probable
reasons
which
induced
their
expulsion
in
europe
suffice
it
to
say
that
whatever
crimes
or
misdemeanours
they
were
guilty
of
they
were
never
called
on
to
answer
before
any
tribunals
and
that
in
many
instances
they
were
treated
especially
in
portugal
with
great
cruelty
and
injustice
the
burning
at
the
age
of
eighty
of
the
unfortunate
malagrida
in
lisbon
under
the
auspices
of
pombal
for
a
book
which
it
seems
improbable
he
could
have
written
in
prison
at
so
great
an
age
and
which
moreover
was
never
brought
into
court
only
supposed
extracts
from
it
being
read
may
serve
as
an
example
in
order
clearly
to
understand
the
position
of
the
jesuits
in
america
and
especially
in
paraguay
and
bolivia
it
is
necessary
to
glance
briefly
at
the
history
of
the
first
conquest
of
the
river
plate
the
discovery
of
america
opened
up
to
europe
and
especially
to
spain
opportunities
for
expansion
of
national
territory
and
individual
advancement
which
no
epoch
either
before
or
since
has
equalled
from
a
cluster
of
small
states
struggling
for
existence
against
a
powerful
enemy
on
their
own
soil
in
a
few
years
spain
became
the
greatest
empire
of
the
world
the
result
was
that
a
spirit
of
adventure
and
a
desire
to
grow
rich
speedily
possessed
all
classes
in
addition
to
this
every
spaniard
in
america
during
the
first
few
years
of
the
conquest
seemed
to
consider
himself
to
some
extent
not
only
as
a
conqueror
but
also
as
a
missionary
now
missionaries
and
conquerors
are
men
on
the
whole
more
imbued
with
their
own
importance
and
sanctity
and
less
disposed
to
consider
consequences
than
almost
any
other
classes
of
mankind
the
conjunction
of
the
two
in
one
disposed
the
of
america
to
imagine
that
no
matter
how
cruel
or
outrageous
their
treatment
of
the
indians
was
they
atoned
for
all
by
the
introduction
of
what
they
considered
the
blessing
of
the
knowledge
of
the
true
faith
it
will
be
seen
at
once
that
if
one
can
determine
with
accuracy
which
of
the
many
preached
about
the
world
is
actually
the
true
faith
a
man
who
is
in
possession
of
it
is
acting
properly
in
endeavouring
to
diffuse
it
the
meanest
soldier
in
the
various
armies
which
left
spain
to
conquer
america
seems
to
have
had
no
doubt
about
the
matter
bernal
diaz
del
castillo
who
as
he
himself
relates
came
to
america
at
the
age
of
eighteen
and
therefore
could
have
had
little
previous
opportunity
of
studying
theology
and
who
moreover
was
unfitted
to
do
so
by
the
want
of
knowledge
of
latin
to
which
he
himself
confesses
yet
at
the
end
of
his
history
of
the
conquest
of
mexico
one
of
the
most
interesting
books
ever
written
has
the
following
passage
it
is
to
be
noted
that
after
god
it
was
we
the
real
conquerors
who
discovered
them
the
indians
and
conquered
them
and
from
the
first
we
took
away
their
idols
and
taught
them
our
holy
doctrine
and
to
us
is
due
the
reward
and
credit
of
it
all
before
any
other
people
even
though
they
be
churchmen
for
when
the
beginning
is
good
the
middle
and
ending
is
good
which
the
curious
attentive
reader
may
see
in
the
christian
polity
and
justice
which
we
showed
them
in
new
spain
i
will
leave
the
matter
and
tell
the
other
benefits
which
after
god
by
our
agency
came
to
the
natives
of
new
spain
bernal
diaz
de
la
conquista
de
la
nueva
vol
cap
madrid
one
would
imagine
on
reading
the
above
extract
bernal
diaz
had
never
killed
an
indian
in
his
life
and
that
he
had
sacrificed
his
prospects
in
coming
to
mexico
solely
to
introduce
christian
polity
and
amongst
the
inhabitants
yet
he
was
no
hypocrite
but
a
stout
sagacious
soldier
even
kindly
according
to
his
lights
and
with
a
love
of
animals
uncommon
in
a
spaniard
for
he
has
preserved
the
names
and
qualities
of
all
the
horses
and
mares
which
came
over
in
the
fleet
from
the
havana
with
cortes
the
phrase
de
after
god
occurs
repeatedly
in
the
writings
of
almost
all
the
of
america
having
after
god
conquered
america
the
first
action
of
the
conquerors
was
to
set
about
making
their
fortunes
in
those
countries
which
produced
gold
and
silver
as
mexico
and
peru
they
worked
the
mines
by
the
labour
of
the
indians
the
cruelties
and
hardships
being
so
great
that
in
a
letter
of
philip
ii
to
the
come
de
chinchon
the
viceroy
of
peru
dated
madrid
april
written
fifty
years
after
the
discovery
he
says
indians
flee
become
ill
and
die
and
have
begun
to
diminish
greatly
in
number
and
they
will
be
finished
soon
unless
an
efficient
remedy
is
provided
shortly
especially
noting
down
the
appearance
and
qualities
of

horse
of

in

there
were
no
mines
but
there
were
other
methods
of
extracting
money
from
the
indians
at
the
first
conquest
paraguay
was
not
the
little
country
bounded
on
the
west
by
the
paraguay
on
the
south
by
the
parana
on
the
north
by
the
aquidaban
and
on
the
east
by
sierra
of
mbaracavu
as
it
is
at
present
on
the
contrary
it
embraced
almost
all
that
immense
territory
known
as
the
argentine
confederation
some
of
the
republic
of
uruguay
and
a
great
portion
of
brazil
embracing
much
of
the
provinces
of
misiones
rio
grande
do
sul
parana
and
matto
grosso
as
well
as
paraguay
itself
how
the
little
country
twelve
hundred
miles
from
the
sea
came
to
give
its
name
to
such
an
enormous
territory
and
to
have
the
seat
of
government
at
asuncion
demands
some
explanation
peru
and
chile
were
discovered
and
occupied
some
time
before
the
eastern
side
of
south
america
their
riches
naturally
drew
great
attention
to
them
but
the
voyage
first
to
cartagena
de
indias
and
then
across
the
isthmus
and
the
again
on
the
pacific
were
both
costly
and
arduous
it
had
been
the
ambition
of
all
explorers
to
discover
some
river
which
would
lead
from
the
atlantic
to
the
mines
of
peru
and
what
is
now
bolivia
then
known
as
alta
peru
of
course
this
might
have
been
achieved
by
ascending
the
amazon
especially
after
the
adventurous
descent
of
it
by
orellana
of
which
fray
gaspar
de
carbajal
has
left
so
curious
a
description
but
whether
on
account
of
the
distance
or
for
some
other
reason
it
never
seems
to
have
been
attempted
in
sebastian
cabot
left
spain
with
three
small
vessels
and
a
caravel
for
the
object
of
reaching
the
moluccas
or
spice
islands
it
was
his
purpose
to
reach
them
through
the
straits
of
magellan
being
compelled
by
want
of
supplies
to
abandon
his
route
he
entered
a
broad
estuary
and
ascended
it
under
the
impression
that
he
had
discovered
another
channel
to
the
pacific
he
soon
found
his
mistake
and
began
to
explore
the
surrounding
country
fifteen
years
before
with
the
same
object
juan
de
solis
had
entered
the
same
estuary
on
the
island
of
martin
garcia
he
was
killed
by
a
chana
indian
and
his
expedition
returned
home
hearing
that
there
was
much
silver
at
the
he
had
called
it
the
rio
de
la
plata
if
we
take
the
of
the
river
plate
to
be
situated
in
bolivia
there
certainly
was
much
silver
there
but
cabot
was
unaware
that
the
were
above
two
thousand
miles
from
the
estuary
and
he
was
not
destined
to
come
near
them
he
did
go
as
far
as
a
point
on
the
river
caracara
in
what
is
now
the
province
of
santa
fe
and
there
he
built
a
fort
which
he
named
espiritu
santo
the
first
spanish
settlement
in
that
part
of
america
whilst
at
espiritu
santo
several
exploring
parties
were
sent
to
scour
the
country
one
of
them
under
a
soldier
of
the
name
of
cesar
never
returned
tradition
always
eager
to
make
up
to
history
for
its
want
of
interest
asserted
that
after
marching
for
years
they
reached
a
city
perhaps
it
was
the
mystic
trapalanda
of
which
the
gauchos
used
to
discourse
at
night
when
seated
round
a
fire
of
bones
upon
the
pampa
perhaps
some
other
for
enchanted
cities
and
eldorados
were
plentiful
in
those
days
in
america
alternating
with
occasional
empires
as
that
of
puytita
near
the
laguna
de
los
xarayes
manoa
and
the
ciudad
de
los
cesares
supposed
to
be
situated
near
arauco
in
the
chilian
andes
however
one
of
the
party
actually
returned
after
years
and
related
his
adventures
to
ruy
diaz
de
guzman
the
first
historian
of
paraguay
thus
it
was
that
the
stream
of
adventurers
was
ever
seeking
for
a
channel
to
the
mines
of
peru
from
the
atlantic
coast
cabot
appears
to
have
ascended
the
parana
to
the
island
of
apipe
and
then
returning
entered
the
river
paraguay
having
ascended
past
what
is
now
asuncion
the
capital
of
paraguay
cabot
encountered
indians
from
the
north
who
told
him
of
the
mines
in
peru
and
in
bolivia
probably
unaware
that
cabot
knew
of
them
already
at
this
point
encouraged
by
what
he
heard
he
gave
the
name
of
rio
de
la
plata
to
what
had
previously
been
known

years
after

having
failed

essential
in

for
as

has
it
in
his

loved

to
be
loved
by
the

was
the
only
chance
a
spanish
officer
had
in
those
times
of
holding
his
own
both

had
both
been

curiously
both
wrote

no

hardly
it
is
true
that
bernal
diaz
who
unlike
schmidel
was
a
man
of
genius
does
so
with
some
discretion
and
always
apparently
with
reason
schmidel
on
the
other
hand
seems
to
have
considered
that
any
officer
who
interfered
between
the

and
the
indians
was
a
tyrant

with
his

want
of
judgment
pitched
upon
what
is
now
the
site
of
buenos

as
the
spot
on
which
to
found
his
colony
it
would
be
difficult
to
select
a
more
inconvenient
place
in
which
to
found
a
town
the
site
of
buenos

is
almost
level
with
the
waters
of
the

which
there
are
shallow
so
shallow
that
large
vessels
could
not
approach
nearer
than
ten
to
fifteen
miles
without

was
exposed
to
the
full
fury
of
the
gales
known
as
however
if
the
site
was
bad
the
air
was
good
at
least
it
seems
so
for
a
captain
of

exclaimed
on

and
hence
the
name
here
every
sort
of
evil
chance
came
on
the
newborn
colony
the
pampa
indians
whom
the
historian
schmidel
seems
to
have
only
known
by
their
guarani
name
of
querandis
at
first
were
friendly
after
a
little
while
they
ceased
to
bring
provisions
and
the
general
sent
out
an
expedition
to
compel
them
under
his
brother
don
diego
de
mendoza
it
does
not
seem
to
have
occurred
to
don
pedro
de
mendoza
that
had
the
of
the
querandis
landed
in
spain
no
one
would
have
brought
him
provisions
for
a
single
day
without
receiving
payment
however
don
had
come
to
america
to
introduce
civilization
and
christianity
and
therefore
knowing
like
bernal
diaz
and
the
other
conquerors
his
own
moral
worth
was
justly
indignant
that
after
a
day
or
two
the
indians
refused
him
more
supplies
in
the
encounter
which
took
place
between
the
spaniards
and
the
indians
don
diego
de

was
slain
and
with
him
several
others
here
for

with
which
as
hulderico

tells
us
the
indians
caught
the
horses
by
the
legs
and
threw
them
down
after
this
foretaste
of
european
justice
the
indians
besieged
the
town
and
brought
it
to
great
straits
so
much
so
that
after
three
men
had
been
hung
for
stealing
a
horse
in

morning

was
discovered
they
had
been

from

occupied

of
the
parana
extending
up
to
latitude
degrees
on
the
paraguay
but
without
crossing
either
that
river
or
the
river
plate
they
had
also
a
few
towns
in
the
province
of
chiquitos
and
the
nation
of
the
chiriguanas
was
an
offshoot
from
them
in
brazil
they
were
soon
all
either
rendered
slaves
or
so
crossed
with
the
african
negro
that
the
pure
race
has
been
almost
entirely
lost
though
the
language
remains
under
the
name
of
the
lingoa
geral
and
many
words
from
it
have
been
introduced
into
portuguese
spoken
by
the
brazilians
as
grass
etc
in
fact
so
great
is
the
number
of
these
words
idioms
phrases
and
terms
of
speech
derived
from
guarani
that
baptista
de
almeida
in
his
preface
to
his
grammar
published
at
rio
janeiro
computes
that
there
are
more
words
derived
from
guarani
than
even
from
arabic
in
the
portuguese
spoken
in
brazil
the
guaranis
in
brazil
were
known
either
as
tupis
from
the
word
savage
or
tupinambas
from
literally
the
savage
or
indigenous
men
perhaps
the
two
most
important
works
upon
the
language
are
the
de

guarani
by
ruiz
de

madrid
it
is
dedicated
to
the

by

madrid
de
he
also
wrote
a
y
arte
de
la
lengua
guarani
guevara
in
his
del
paraguay
relates
a
curious
story
which
he
said
was
current
amongst
the
indians
two
brothers
tupi
and
guarani
lived
with
their
families
upon
the
of
brazil
in
those
days
the
world
was
quite
unpopulated
but
by
themselves
they
quarrelled
about
a
parrot
and
tupi
with
his
family
went
north
and
populated
all
brazil
whilst
guarani
went
west
and
was
the
ancestor
of
all
the
indians
of
the
race
of
guaranis
jean
de
lery
the
huguenot
pastor
and
friend
of
calvin
passed
a
year
on
the
coast
of
brazil
about
having
accompanied
the
expedition
of
the
famous
villegagnau
in
his
book
voyage
faict
en
la
terre
du
brezil
he
always
refers
to
the
indians
as
toupinaubaoults
and
has
preserved
many
curious
details
of
them
before
they
had
had
much
contact
with
europeans
he
appears
to
have
had
a
considerable
acquaintance
with
the
language
and
has
left
some
curious
conversations
langage
sauvage
et
franc
ais
in
which
he
gives
some
grammatical
rules
the
language
of
conversation
is
almost
identical
with
that
of
paraguay
though
some
words
are
used
which
are
either
peculiar
to
the
tupis
or
obsolete
in
paraguay
his
account
of
their
customs
tallies
with
that
of
the
various
spanish
writers
and
explorers
who
have
written
on
the
subject
tobacco
which
seems
to
have
been
known
under
the
name
of
to
lery
he
finds
in
brazil
under
the
name
of
the
same
name
by
which
it
is
called
in
paraguay
at
present
he
believed
that
and
were
two
different
plants
but
the
only
reason
he
adduces
for
his
belief
is
that
was
brought
in
his
time
from
florida
which
as
he
observes
is
more
than
a
thousand
leagues
from
terre
du
brezil
his
experience
of
savages
was
the
same
as
that
of
azara
and
almost
all
early
travellers
for
he
says
toupinambaoults
rec
oivent
fort
humainement
les
estrangers

qui
les
vont
visiter
lery
however
seemed
to
think
that
in
spite
of
their
pacific
inclination
it
was
not
prudent
to
put
too
much
power
in
their
hands
for
he
remarks
reste
chargeyent
et
remplisseyent
leurs
mousquets
jusques
au
bout
nous

la
poudre
de
charbon
this
may
have
been
a
wise
precaution
but
he
omits
to
state
if
the
broye
was
at
the
same
price
as
good
powder
according
to
azara
who
takes
his
facts
partly
from
the
contemporary
writers
schmidel
alvar
nunez
ruy
diaz
de
guzman
and
barco
de
la
centenera
the
guaranis
were
divided
into
numerous
tribes
as
imbeguas
caracaras
tembues
colistines
and
many
others
these
tribes
though
apparently
of
a
common
origin
never
united
but
each
lived
separately
under
its
own
chief
their
towns
were
generally
either
close
to
or
in
the
middle
of
forests
or
at
the
edge
of
rivers
where
there
is
wood
they
all
cultivated
pumpkins
beans
maize
mani
ground
nuts
sweet
potatoes
and
mandioca
but
they
lived
largely
by
the
chase
and
ate
much
wild
honey
diaz
in
his
lib
chap
i
makes
them
cannibals
azara
believes
this
to
have
been
untrue
as
no
traditions
of
cannibalism
were
current
amongst
the
guaranis
in
his
time
in
liberal
as
azara
was
and
careful
observer
of
what
he
saw
himself
i
am
disposed
to
believe
the
testimony
of
so
many
of
the
customs
of
the
primitive
guaranis
though
none
of
them
had
the
advantage
enjoyed
by
azara
of
living
three
hundred
years
after
the
conquest
it
may
be
of
course
that
the
powers
of
observation
were
not
so
well
developed
in
mankind
in
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
as
at
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
but
this
point
i
leave
to
those
whose
business
it
is
to
prove
that
the
human
mind
is
in
a
progressive
state
however
father
montoya
in
his
espiritual
del
paraguay
affirms
most
positively
that
they
used
to
eat
their
prisoners
taken
in
war
azara
in
his
y
historia
del
paraguay
has
a
similar
passage

para

their
general
characteristics
seem
to
have
been
much
the
same
as
those
of
other
indians
of
america
for
instance
they
kept
their
hair
and
teeth
to
an
extreme
old
age
their
sight
was
keen
they
seldom
looked
you
in
the
face
whilst
speaking
and
their
disposition
was
cold
and
reserved
the
tone
of
their
voices
was
low
so
low
that
as
azara
says
voz
nunca
es
gruesa
ni
sonora
y
hablan
siempre
muy
bajo
sin
gritar
aun
para
quejarse
si
los
matan
de
manera
que
si
camina
uno
diez
pasos
delante
no
le
llama
el
que
le
necesita
sino
que
va
alcanzarle
this
i
have
myself
observed
when
travelling
with
indians
even
on
horseback
there
was
one
characteristic
of
the
guaranis
in
which
they
differed
greatly
from
most
of
the
indian
tribes
in
their
vicinity
as
the
indians
of
the
chaco
and
the
pampas
for
all
historians
alike
agree
that
they
were
most
unwarlike
it
is
from
this
characteristic
that
the
jesuits
were
able
to
make
such
a
complete
conquest
of
them
for
notwithstanding
all
their
efforts
they
never
really
succeeded
in
permanently
establishing
themselves
amongst
any
of
the
tribes
in
the
chaco
or
upon
the
pampas
the
name
guarani
is
variously
derived
pedro
de
angelis
in
his
de
obras
y
documentos
derives
it
from
paint
and
sign
of
the
plural
making
the
signification
of
the
word
ones
or
men
demersay
in
his
du
paraguay
thinks
it
probable
that
the
word
is
an
alteration
of
the
word
numerous
barco
de
la
book
canto
i
says
the
word
means
and
was
applied
on
account
of
their
savageness
be
that
as
it
may
it
is
certain

the

did
not
at

of

not
now
apply
the

themselves
except
when
talking
spanish
or
to
a

the

indian

how
they
speak

a

chronicle
contained
in
the
collection
of
primitivos

of

barcia

in
the
same
way
the

is
variously
derived
from
a
corruption
of
the
word
the
name
of
an
indian
tribe
and
the
guarani
word
for
water
meaning
river
of
the
payaguas
others
again
derive
it
from
a
guarani
word
meaning
and
water
and
make
it
the
crowned
river
either
from
the
which
crown
its
banks
or
the
feather

which
the
indians
wore
at

again
derive
it
from

called

again
angelis
in
his
work

derives
it
from
paragua
the
name
of
a
celebrated
indian
chief
at
the
time
of
the
conquest
what
is
certain
is
that
is
the
guarani
for
water
and
this
is
something
in
a
derivation
is
perhaps
as
hard
to
pronounce
as
the
gaelic
a
calf
the
nasal
in
arabic
or
the
kaffir
clicks
having
both
a
guttural
and
a
nasal
aspiration
it
is
rarely
attempted
with
success
by
foreigners
even
when
long
resident
in
the
country
though
paraguay
was
so
completely
the
country
of
the
jesuits
in
they
were
not
the
first
religious
order
to
go
there
almost
in
every
instance
the
ecclesiastics
who
accompanied
the
first
conquerors
of
america
were
franciscans
the
jesuits
are
said
to
have
sent
two
priests
to
bahia
in
brazil
ten
years
after
their
order
was
founded
but
both
in
brazil
and
paraguay
the
franciscans
were
before
them
in

of
time
lozano
in
his

paraguay
compares
it
to
greek
but
in
my
opinion
fails
to
establish
his
case
but
then
so
few
people
know
both
greek
and
guarani
san
francisco
solano
the
first
ecclesiastic
who
rose
to
much
note
as
a
missionary
and
who
made
his
celebrated
journey
through
the
chaco
in
from
peru
to
paraguay
was
a
franciscan
thus
the
franciscans
had
the
honour
of
having
the
first
american
saint
in
their
ranks
it
is
noteworthy
though
that
he
was
recalled
from
paraguay
by
his
superiors
who
seem
to
have
had
no
very
exalted
opinion
of
him
he
passed
through
the
whole
chaco
descending
the
pilcomayo
to
its
junction
with
the
paraguay
through
territories
but
little
explored
even
perhaps
the
most
complete

of

it
seems
as
if
providence
in
granting
him
miraculous
powers
had
forgotten
the
other
necessary
steps
to
make
them
effective
that
he
really
had
these
powers
seems
strange
but
san
francisco
solano
narrates
of
himself
that
in
passing
through
the
chaco
he
learned
the
languages
of
several
of
the
tribes
and
to
them
in
their
own
tongues
of
the
birth
death
and
transfiguration
of
christ
the
mysteries
of
the
trinity
transubstantiation
and
atonement
that
he
explained
to
them
the
symbols
of
the
church
the
papal
succession
from
peter
downwards
and
that
he
catechized
the
indians
by
thousands
tens
and
hundreds
of
thousands
and
that
they
came
in
tears
and
penitence
to
acknowledge
their
belief
of
course
it
is
difficult
to
controvert
these
statements
even
if
inclined
to
do
so
but
the
languages
spoken
by
the
chaco
indians
are
amongst
the
most
difficult
to
learn
of
any
spoken
by
the
human
race
so
much
so
that
father
dobrizhoffer
in
his
of
the
abipones
says
the
sounds
produced
by
the
indians
of
the
chaco
resembled
nothing
human
so
do
they
sneeze
and
stutter
and
cough
in
such
a
language
the
athanasian
creed
itself
would
be
puzzling
to
a
neophyte
he
also
says
that
several
of
the
jesuits
who
had
laboured
for
years
amongst
the
indians
could
never
master
their
dialects
and
when
they
preached
the
indians
received
their
words
with
shouts
of
laughter
this
the
good
priest
attributed
to
the
presence
of
a
devil
who
possessed
them
it
may
be
that
the
mocking
devil
was
but
a
sense
of
humour
the
possession
of
which
even
amongst
good
christians
has
been
known
to
give
offence
but
be
this
as
it
may
san
francisco
de
solano
remained
two
years
at
asuncion
though
whilst
he
lived
there
his
powers
of
speech
according
to
the
jesuits
seem
to
have
been
diminished
and
he
held
no
communication
with
the
indians
in
their
own
languages
it
may
be
that
like
paul
he
preferred
to
speak
when
not
with
indians
five
words
with
his
understanding
rather
than
ten
thousand
in
an
unknown
tongue
at
the
time
of
the
first
conquest
paraguay
was
almost
entirely
peopled
by
the
guarani
race
it
does
not
appear
that
their
number
was
ever
very
great
perhaps
not
exceeding
a
million
in
the
whole
country
from
the
writings
of
montoya
guevara
lozano
and
the
other
missionaries
of
the
time
it
is
certain
that
they
had
attained
to
no
very
high
degree
of
civilization
though
they
were
certainly
more
advanced
than
their
neighbours
in
the
gran
chaco
it
is
most
probable
that
they
had
not
a
single
town
or
even
a
house
or
that
such
a
thing
existed
south
of
new
granada
to
the
eastward
of
the
andes
for
we
may
take
the
description
in
of
the
casa
del

either
as
a
mistake
or
as
a
story
which
he
had
heard
from
some
peruvian
indian
of
the
palaces
of
the
incas
at
any
rate
no
remains
of
houses
still
less
of
palaces
are
known
to
have
been
found
in
brazil
or

this
race
at
one

from

all

in

their
limits
to
the
south
extend
to
near
the
ruined

by
preference
they
seem
to
dwell
about
the

affluent
of
the
parana
and
in
the
chain
of
mountains
known
either
as

or
mbaracayu
the
paraguayans
generally
refer
to
them
as
monteses
dwellers
in
the
woods
and
sometimes
as
caaguas
they
present
almost
the
same
characteristics
as
they
did
at
the
discovery
of
the
country
and
wander
in
the
woods

the
jesuits
describe
them
as

their

the
difference
in

amongst
the
guaranis
is
less
noticeable
than
amongst
europeans
their
language
is
poorer
than
the
guarani
spoken
by
the
paraguayans
and
the
pronunciation
both
more
nasal
and
guttural
their

only
extend
to

was
the

at

time
of

their
numerals
are
four
in
number
after
this
they
are
said
to
count
in

in
the

way
as
do
the
paraguayans
much
has
been

exist

see

like
their

they
seldom
unite
in
large
numbers
and
pay
little
honour
or
obedience
to
their
chiefs
who
differ
in
no
respect
either
in
arms
dress
or
position
from
the
ordinary
tribesmen
in
brazil
they
are
confined
to
the
southern
portion
of
the
province
of
san
paulo
and
are
called
by
the
brazilians
bugres
that
is
slaves
a
more
unfitting
name
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
hit
upon
as
all
efforts
to
civilize
them
have
proved
abortive
and
they
still
range
the
forests
attacking
small
parties
of
travellers
and
burning
isolated
the
brazilians
assert
that
they
are
cannibals
but
little
is
known
positively
as
to
this
what
has
altered
them
so
entirely
from
the
original
guaranis
of
the
time
of
the
conquest
who
were
so
easily
subdued
it
is
hard
to
conjecture
one
thing
is
certain
that
the
example
given
them
by
the
christian
settlers
has
evidently
not
been
such
as
to
induce
them
to
leave
their
wild
life
and
enter
into
the
bonds
of
civilization
diaz
in
the
thinks
the
caribs
of
the
west
indies
were
guaranis
and
the
jesuits
often
refer
to
them
under
that
name
this
point
would
be
easily
set
at
rest
by
examining
if
any
guarani
words
remain
in
the
dialect
of
the
caribs
of
the
mosquito
coast
as
to
their
relative
numbers
at
the
time
of
the
foundation
of

missions
it
is
most
difficult
to

the
numbers
given

over
the
door
every
inhabitant
claimed
to
be
a
nobleman
and
in
the
reign
of
charles
they
furnished
many
soldiers
of
repute
in
the
wars
of
europe
and
america
the
system
of
irala
was
to
conciliate
rather
than
subdue
the
natives
isolated
from
help
of
every
kind
the
length
of
the
voyage
from
spain
precluding
all
idea
of
speedy
succour
in
a
rebellion
it
was
the
only
course
he
could
pursue
from
the
very
first
he
encouraged
the
soldiers
to
marry
women
of
the
country
thus
creating
ties
which
bound
them
to
the
land
two
franciscan
set
about
at
once
to
learn
the
language
and
preach
to
the
people
they
also
seem
to
have
endeavoured
to
reduce
the
guarani
language
to
writing
so
from
several
circumstances
the
early
history
of
paraguay
was
very
different
from
that
of
every
other
spanish
possession
in
america
to
all
the
others
spanish
women
seem
to
have
gone
in
greater
or
in
smaller
numbers
to
paraguay
at
the
foundation
of
asuncion
it
seems
that
hardly
any
women
went
thus
it
will
be
seen
that
the
franciscans
were
at
work
in
the
country
long
before
the
arrival
of
the
jesuits
it
may
be
on
this
account
that
they
became
such
bitter
enemies
of
the
later
comers
so
there
a
different
state
of
society
arose
to
that
for
example
in
chile
or
in
mexico
in
both
those
countries
few
spaniards
ever
married
native
women
those
who
did
so
were
either
members
of
the
highest
class
who
sometimes
but
rarely
married
indian
women
of
position
from
motives
of
policy
or
else
the
lowest
class
of
spaniards
in
this
case
after
a
generation
their
children
became
practically
indians
in
paraguay
it
was
quite
the
contrary
and
the
grandchildren
of
indian
mothers
and
spanish
fathers
were
almost
reckoned
spaniards
and
the
next
generation
always
so
washburne
in
his
of
paraguay
cap
vol
i
points
out
the
contrast
between
the
effects
of
the
treatment
meted
out
by
penn
to
the
indians
in
pennsylvania
and
that
by
irala
in
paraguay
where
he
asks
are
the
indian
tribes
with
whom
the
celebrated
quaker
treated
in
paraguay
on
the
other
hand
at
least
in
the
time
when
washburne
was
minister
from
the
united
states
to
lopez
from
to
the
few
remaining
paraguayans
of
the
upper
class
were
almost
all
descended
from
the
intermarriages
of
the
followers
of
irala
with
the
natives
the
tyranny
of
lopez
and
the
effects
of
the
disastrous
war
with
brazil
and
the
argentine
republic
have
almost
extirpated
every
paraguayan
of
the
old
stock
with
the
least
pretensions
to
white
descent
ruiz
diaz
de
guzman
speaking
of
the
mixed
race
in
paraguay
and
buenos
ayres
says
are
generally
good
soldiers
of
great
spirit
and
valour
expert
in
the
use
of
arms
especially
in
that
of
the
musquet
so
much
so
that
when
they
go
on
long
journeys
they
are
accustomed
to
live
on
the
game
which
they
kill
with
it
it
is
common
for
them
to
kill
birds
on
the
wing
and
he
is
accounted
unfit
for
a
soldier
who
can
not
bring
down
a
pigeon
they
are
such
excellent
horsemen
that
there
is
no
one
who
is
not
able
to
tame
and
ride
an
unbroken
colt
women
generally
are
virtuous
beautiful
and
of
a
gentle
disposition
if
the
inhabitants
of
paraguay
and
the
river
plate
of
those
days
were
good
marksmen
it
is
more
than
can
be
said
of
the
gauchos
of
the
argentine
provinces
and
the
paraguayans
of
twenty
years
ago
without
military
training
so
far
from
being
able
to
bring
down
a
pigeon
on
the
wing
few
could
hit
the
trunk
of
a
tree
at
fifty
paces
the
usual
method
of
shooting
used
to
be
to
cram
as
much
ammunition
into
the
gun
as
the
hand
would
contain
and
then
looking
carefully
away
from
the
object
aimed
at
to
close
both
eyes
and
pull
the
trigger
accuracy
of
aim
was
not
so
much
considered
as
loudness
of
report
as
regards
their
powers
of
riding
they
are
still
unchanged
and
as
to
the
virtue
of
their
women
virtue
is
so
largely
a
matter
of
convention
that
it
is
generally
wisest
to
leave
such
matters
uncommented
on
as
it
is
so
easy
not
to
understand
the
conventions
of
the
people
of
whom
one
writes
whilst
irala
was
conciliating
the
guaranis
in
paraguay
charles
had
not
forgotten
that
the
new
settlement
of
buenos
ayres
had
been
abandoned
after
much
search
he
selected
alvar
nunez
cabeza
de
vaca
to
be
the
new
governor
and
as
alvar
nunez
was
perhaps
the
most
remarkable
of
all
the
spanish
of
the
new
world
it
may
not
be
out
of
place
to
give
some
facts
of
his
career
as
his
policy
in
regard
to
the
indians
was
almost
that
of
the
jesuits
in
as
he
himself
informs
us
in
his
commentaries
his
was
that
pedro
de
vera
who
won
canaria
and
his
mother
teresa
cabeza
de
vaca
a
noble
lady
of
jerez
de
la
frontera
after
the
spanish
fashion
of
the
time
he
used
the
names
of
both
his
parents
de
alvar
nunez
cabeza
de
vaca
published
by
don
andres
gonzalez
barcia
in
his
collection
of
historians
of
the
indies
madrid
in
he
sailed
with
the
expedition
of
panfilo
de
narvaez
to
apalache
in
florida
was
shipwrecked
tried
to
regain
the
spanish
settlements
in
boats
and
then
cast
by
a
storm
absolutely
naked
and
with
only
three
companions
upon
an
unknown
land
taken
by
the
indians
he
was
made
a
slave
then
rose
to
be
a
pedlar
then
a
doctor
and
finally
a
chief
held
sacred
for
his
mysterious
powers
at
last
he
made
his
way
on
foot
into
the
territory
of
new
spain
not
as
a
captive
but
as
the
leader
of
several
hundred
indians
who
followed
him
and
did
his
bidding
as
if
he
had
been
born
their
chief
rambling
about
for
months
but
always
followed
by
his
indians
he
at
length
encountered
a
spanish
and
accosting
him
found
he
had
almost
forgotten
spanish
during
his
ten
years
sojourn
with
the
indians
his
first
entreaty
when
he
found
spanish
gradually
returning
to
him
was
to
the
spaniards
not
to
harass
his
indian
following
then
he
besought
the
indians
themselves
to
cease
their
nomad
life
and
cultivate
the
soil
in
neither
case
was
he
successful
as
the
spaniards
like
all
other
europeans
held
indians
little
removed
from
dogs
and
for
the
indians
the
few
remaining
are
as
much
attached
to
their
old
wandering
life
as
in
the
days
of
the
discovery
of
the
new
world
in
all
that
alvar
nunez
writes
he
shows
a
grandeur
of
soul
and
spirit
far
different
from
the
writings
not
only
of
the
conquerors
of
the
new
world
but
of
the
conquerors
of
africa
of
for
him
no
bragging
of
his
exploits
all
that
he
says
he
sets
down
modestly
and
with
excuses
as
every
now
and
then
pesa
hablar
de
mis
trabajos
and
as
befits
a
gentleman
lastly
he
leaves
the
reader
when
describing
his
captivity
in
florida
by
telling
him
quite
quietly
and
without
comment
that
god
was
pleased
to
save
from
all
these
perils
himself
alonso
del
castillo
maldonado
andres
dorantes
and
that
the
fourth
was
a
negro
called
estevanico
a
native
of
azimur
but
not
contented
with
his
ten
years
captivity
after
three
years
at
home
he
entered
into
a
certain
and
with
the
king
to
sail
at
his
own
charges
with
an
expedition
to
succour
don
pedro
de
mendoza
who
was
hard
pressed
by
famine
and
the
indians
at
buenos
ayres
he
agreed
to
furnish
eight
thousand
ducats
horses
arms
men
and
provisions
at
his
own
expense
upon
condition
that
he
was
made
governor
and
adelantado
of
the
rio
de
la
plata
and
general
both
of
its
armies
and
its
fleets
it
must
be
allowed
however
that
in
their
writings
few
of
the
spanish
of
america
bragged
much
they
mostly
gave
the
credit
of
all
their
doings
to
the
god
of
battles
the
boasting
has
been
reserved
for
the
conquerors
of
africa
in
our
own
time
is
a
contract
the
contract
which
charles
at
the
but
unfortunate
instigation
of
las
casas
made
with
the
genoese
to
supply
negroes
for
america
is
known
as
asiento
de
los
negros
in
the
made
by
alvar
nunez
with
the
king
occurs
the
celebrated
clause
no
pasasen
procuradores
ni
abogados
a
las
indias
that
neither
solicitors
nor
barristers
should
go
to
the
indies
it
is
unfortunate
it
was
not
held
to
stringently
as
in
paraguay
at
least
the
reptilia
were
already
well
represented
upon
november
he
embarked
at
cadiz
with
his
fleet
consisting
of
a
caravel
and
two
ships
all
went
well
up
to
the
cape
de
verdes
on
nearing
the
equator
it
occurred
to
the
del
agua
to
examine
his
stock
of
water
and
out
of
one
hundred
pipes
which
had
been
put
aboard
he
found
but
three
remaining
and
from
these
the
thirty
horses
and
four
hundred
men
who
were
on
board
all
had
to
drink
seeing
the
greatness
of
the
necessity
the
governor
for
alvar
nunez
almost
always
speaks
of
himself
in
the
third
person
gave
orders
that
the
fleet
should
make
for
land
days
he
says
in
his
commentaries
sailed
in
search
of
it
and
on
the
fourth
just
before
sunrise
occurred
a
very
notable
affair
and
as
it
is
not
altogether
de
proposito
i
set
it
down
and
it
is
this
going
towards
the
land
the
ships
had
almost
touched
on
some
sharp
rocks
we
had
not
seen
then
as
now
i
take
it
vigilance
was
not
a
noticeable
quality
in
spanish
sailors
just
as
the
vessels
were
almost
on
the
rocks
cricket
commenced
to
sing
which
cricket
a
sick
soldier
had
put
into
the
ship
at
cadiz
being
anxious
to
hear
its
music
and
for
the
two
months
which
our
navigation
had
endured
no
one
had
heard
it
whereat
the
soldier
was
much
enraged
and
as
on
that
morning
it
felt
the
land
la
tierra
it
commenced
to
sing
and
its
music
wakened
all
the
people
of
the
ship
who
saw
the
cliffs
which
were
distant
almost
a
from
where
we
were
so
we
cast
out
anchors
and
saved
the
ship
and
it
is
certain
that
if
the
cricket
had
not
sung
all
of
us
four
hundred
soldiers
and
thirty
horses
had
been
lost
some
of
the
crew
accepted
the
occurrence
as
a
miracle
from
god
but
nunez
himself
is
silent
on
that
head
being
a
better
observer
of
natural
history
than
a
theologian
but
there
and
sailing
more
than
a
hundred
leagues
along
the
coast
the
cricket
every
evening
gave
us
his
music
and
thus
with
it
we
arrived
at
a
little
port
beyond
cape
frio
where
the
adelantado
landed
and
unfurled
his
flag
and
took
possession
for
his
majesty
the
expedition
disembarked
at
santa
catalina
in
brazil
the
governor
landed
his
men
and
of
the
horses
which
had
escaped
the
sea
all
that
remained
of
embarked
in
spain
the
theologicum
gave
the
governor
some
work
at
once
two
friars
fray
bernardo
de
armenta
and
fray
alonso
lebron
franciscans
had
burnt
the
houses
of
some
indians
who
had
retaliated
in
the
heathen
fashion
by
slaughtering
two
christians
the
being
scandalized
the
governor
sent
for
the
friars
admonished
them
and
told
them
to
restrain
their
zeal
this
was
the
first
false
step
he
made
and
set
all
friars
and
priests
throughout
america
against
him
hearing
at
santa
catalina
that
buenos
ayres
was
almost
abandoned
and
that
the
inhabitants
had
founded
the
town
of
asuncion
del
paraguay
alvar
determined
to
march
thither
by
land
and
send
his
ship
into
the
river
plate
and
up
the
paraguay
the
two
franciscan
friars
he
told
to
remain
and
the
indians
this
they
refused
to
do
saying
they
wished
to
reside
amongst
the
spaniards
in
asuncion
had
they
been
jesuits
it
is
ten
to
one
they
had
remained
and
spent
their
lives
for
the
jesuits
alone
of
all
the
religious
orders
were
ever
ready
to
take
every
risk
upon
his
march
the
governor
contrary
to
all
good
policy
and
precedent
ordered
that
nothing
should
be
taken
from
the
indians
without
due
payment
being
made
to
insure
this
being
done
he
paid
for
all
provisions
himself
and
served
them
out
to
the
soldiery
this
made
him
as
unpopular
with
his
soldiers
as
his
dealings
with
the
two
franciscans
had
made
him
amongst
the
friars
surely
he
might
have
known
that
pizarro
cortes
almagro
and
the
rest
were
men
who
never
paid
for
anything
still
he
persisted
in
his
conduct
to
the
end
and
so
brought
ruin
on
himself
the
indians
seemed
to
appreciate
his
method
for
he
says
that
the
news
was
spread
abroad
of
the
good
treatment
the
governor
gave
to
all
they
came
to
meet
the
army
decked
with
flowers
and
bringing
provisions
in
great
abundance
it
was
he
also
says
thing
to
see
how
frightened
the
indians
were
of
the
horses
and
how
they
brought
them
food
chickens
and
honey
to
keep
them
quiet
and
in
good
humour
and
they
asked
the
governor
to
tell
the
horses
not
to
hurt
them
after
passing
the
river
iguazu
he
sent
the
two
friars
ahead
to
collect
provisions
and
the
governor
arrived
the
indians
had
no
more
to
give
this
is
perhaps
the
first
account
of
the
levying
of
the
tithe
in
the
new
world
so
having
started
from
the
coast
upon
november
he
arrived
at
asuncion
on
march
having
accomplished
a
march
of
more
than
two
thousand
miles
with
but
the
loss
of
a
single
man
and
without
the
slaughter
of
a
single
indian
hardly
had
he
arrived
at
asuncion
before
he
found
himself
embroiled
on
every
side
the
indians
were
in
full
rebellion
the
settlement
of
buenos
ayres
almost
in
ruins
and
the
officers
appointed
by
the
king
to
collect
the
royal
dues
all
hostile
to
him
to
a
man
after
having
consulted
with
the
clergy
to
find
if
they
thought
it
lawful
to
attack
the
guaycurus
who
had
assailed
the
town
he
received
the
opinion
it
was
not
only
lawful
but
expedient
therefore
he
sent
off
an
expedition
against
them
to
which
was
joined
a
priest
to
require
the
guaycurus
to
become
christians
and
to
acknowledge
the
king
of
spain
the
propositions
not
unnaturally
did
not
seem
reasonable
to
the
indians
who
most
likely
were
unaware
of
the
benefits
which
christianity
confers
and
probably
heard
for
the
first
time
of
the
king
of
spain
the
governor
who
seems
to
have
doubted
of
the
humanity
of
the
clergy
called
another
council
which
confirmed
the
previous
opinion
strangely
enough
this
seems
to
have
surprised
him
for
he
probably
did
not
reflect
that
the
clergy
would
not
have
to
fight
themselves
and
that
the
first
blood
ever
spilt
on
earth
was
on
account
of
a
religious
difference
just
before
the
expedition
started
it
was
found
that
the
two
franciscan
friars
who
had
come
with
him
from
santa
catalina
could
not
be
found
it
then
appeared
they
had
started
back
to
the
coast
accompanied
by
a
bevy
of
indian
damsels
in
all
they
were
followed
and
brought
back
and
then
explained
that
they
were
on
their
way
to
spain
to
complain
against
the
governor
the
dusky
catechumens
remained
without
an
explanation
and
the
people
were
once
more
the
governor
then
started
out
against
the
guaycurus
only
those
who
know
the
chaco
or
western
bank
of
the
river
paraguay
can
form
the
least
idea
of
what
such
an
expedition
must
have
been
even
in
the
chaco
the
change
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
can
be
but
slight
as
a
steamer
slips
along
the
bank
nothing
for
miles
and
miles
is
seen
but
swamp
intersected
with
backwaters
in
which
lie
alligators
electric
eels
and
stinging
rays
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
are
swamps
swamps
and
more
swamps
a
sea
of
waving
after
the
swamps
thickets
of
tacuaras
canes
forests
of
thorny

alvar
nunez
as
he
tells
us
in
his
commentaries
started
with
four
hundred
men
and
with
one
thousand
friendly
indians
all
well
armed
and
painted
and
with
plates
of
metal
on
their
heads
to
reflect
the
sun
and
so
strike
terror
to
their
enemies
to
save
the
horses
they
were
put
on
board
whilst
the
indians
marched
along
the
bank
keeping
up
with
the
ships
horses
at
that
time
in
paraguay
and
in
peru
often
were
worth
one
thousand
crowns
of
gold
though
azara
tells
us
that
in
the
last
century
in
buenos
ayres
you
could
often
buy
a
good
horse
for
two
needles
so
cheap
had
they
become
then
as
at
present
time
was
of
no
account
in
paraguay
so
almost
every
day
they
landed
the
horses
to
keep
them
in
condition
and
to
chase
the
ostriches
and

azara
in

del

tells
us
that
in
domingo
de
irala
at
asuncion
bought
a
fine
black
horse
for
five
thousand
gold
crowns
he
bound
himself
to
pay
for
him
out
of
the
proceeds
of
his
first
conquest
just
the
kind
of
army
that
a
thinking
man
would
like
to
march
with
not
too
much
to
eat
but
still
a
pleasant
feeling
of
marching
to
spread
religion
and
to
make
one
fortune
with
but
the
solitary
unpleasant
feature
to
the
soldier
the
system
of
payment
for
provisions
which
the
governor
prescribed
all
was
new
and
strange
the
world
was
relatively
young
each
night
the
governor
religiously
wrote
up
his
diary
now
chronicling
the
death
of
some
good
horse
or
of
an
indian
or
commenting
upon
the
fruits
the
fish
the
animals
the
trees
and
the
other
things
of
god
which
differ
from
those
in
the
castiles
occasionally
a
fight
took
place
with
guasarapos
or
with
pagayuas
but
nothing
of
much
account
mucha
monta
always
the
tales
of
to
be
met
with
further
on
eventually
the
expedition
came
to
a
point
not
far
from
where
is
now
the
town
of
corumba
there
alvar
nunez
founded
a
town
to
which
he
gave
the
name
of
reyes
which
has
long
fallen
into
decay
he
also
sent
two
captains
to
explore
and
search
for
gold
waiting
two
or
three
months
for
their
return
and
suffering
from
a
quartan
ague
which
confined
him
to
his
bed
then
having
failed
to
find
the
he
set
his
face
again
towards
asuncion
just
before
starting
he
gave
the
final
blow
to
his
waning
popularity
some
of
his
followers
having
taken
indian
girls
had
hidden
them
on
board
the
ships
this
when
he
knew
it
nunez
at
once
forbade
and
sending
for
the
fathers
of
the
girls
restored
their
children
to
them
this
he
says
natives
were
much
pleased
but
the
spaniards
rendered
angry
and
desperate
and
for
this
cause
they
hated
me
nothing
more
natural
and
for
the
same
cause
the
spanish
paraguayans
hated
the
jesuits
who
carried
out
the
policy
which
the
wise
governor
began
on
april
the
governor
returned
to
asuncion
worn
out
and
ill
with
ague
there
he
found
all
confusion
domingo
de
irala
a
clever
ambitious
biscayan
soldier
who
had
been
interim
governor
before
nunez
had
arrived
had
worked
upon
the
people
saying
that
nunez
wished
to
take
away
their
property
as
their
chief
property
was
in
indians
whom
they
had
enslaved
this
rendered
nunez
most
unpopular
and
the
same
kind
of
allegations
were
laid
against
him
as
were
laid
against
the
jesuits
when
in
their
turn
they
denounced
slavery
in
paraguay
all
the
complaints
were
in
the
name
of
liberty
as
generally
is
the
case
when
tyranny
or
villainy
of
any
sort
is
to
be
done
so
alvar
tells
us
in
his
commentaries
that
at
the
hour
of
the
ave
maria
ten
or
twelve
of
the
entered
his
house
where
he
lay
ill
in
bed
all
shouting
and
to
prove
they
were
all
good
patriots
one
jaime
resquin
put
a
bent
crossbow
to
his
side
and
forced
him
to
get
out
of
bed
and
took
him
off
to
prison
amid
a
crowd
all
shouting
the
friends
of
liberty
upon
the
other
side
attempted
a
rescue
but
the
were
too
strong
so
the
unpatriotic
governor
was
thrown
heavily
ironed
into
a
cell
out
of
which
to
make
room
they
let
a
murderer
who
was
awaiting
death
alvar
nunez
grimly
remarks
haste
to
take
my
cloak
and
then
set
off
down
the
street
at
once
calling
out
liberty
that
everything
should
be
in
order
the
patriots
confiscated
all
the
governor
goods
and
took
his
papers
publishing
a
proclamation
that
they
did
so
because
he
was
a
tyrant
unluckily
the
indians
have
not
left
us
any
commentaries
or
it
would
be
curious
to
learn
what
they
thought
as
to
the
tyranny
of
alvar
nunez
most
probably
they
thought
as
the
indians
of
the
jesuit
missions
thought
at
the
expulsion
of
the
jesuits
from
paraguay
as
is
set
forth
in
the
curious
memorial
addressed
in
by
the
people
of
the
mission
of
san
luis
to
the
governor
of
buenos
ayres
praying
that
the
jesuits
might
be
suffered
to
remain
instead
of
the
friars
who
had
been
sent
to
replace
them
against
the
people
will
having
got
the
governor
into
prison
the
patriots
had
to
elect
another
chief
and
the
choice
naturally
upon
domingo
de
irala
who
having
been
interim
governor
had
never
ceased
intriguing
from
the
first
he
promptly
put
his
friends
in
office
after
the
fashion
of
all
governors
whether
they
enter
office
to
the
cry
of
or
not
the
friends
of
alvar
nunez
in
the
usual
spanish
fashion
long
sanctified
by
use
and
wont
declared
themselves
in
opposition
that
is
they
roamed
about
the
land
proving
by
theft
and
murder
that
their
love
of
liberty
was
just
as
strong
as
that
of
those
in
power
things
shortly
came
to
such
a
pass
that
no
one
could
leave
his
house
by
night
the
marauding
guaycurus
burnt
all
the
suburbs
and
threatened
to
attack
the
town
nunez
himself
was
guarded
day
and
night
by
four
men
armed
with
daggers
in
a
close
prison
as
he
says
himself
his
prison
was
not
for
his
health
for
day
and
night
he
had
to
keep
a
candle
burning
to
see
to
read
and
the
grass
grew
underneath
his
bed
whilst
for
the
sake
of
he
had
a
pair
of
fetters
on
his
feet
for
his
chief
gaoler
they
procured
one
hernando
de
sosa
whom
nunez
had
put
in
gaol
for
striking
an
indian
chief
a
guard
watched
constantly
at
the
prison
gate
but
still
in
spite
of
this
he
managed
to
communicate
almost
uninterruptedly
with
his
friends
outside
his
method
was
certainly
ingenious
his
food
was
brought
to
him
by
an
indian
girl
whom
so
great
was
the
fear
of
the
patriots
that
he
should
write
to
the
king
they
made
walk
naked
into
the
prison
carrying
the
dishes
and
with
her
head
shaved
notwithstanding
this
she
managed
to
bring
a
piece
of
paper
hidden
between
her
toes
the
party
of
liberty
suspecting
that
nunez
was
communicating
with
his
friends
procured
an
indian
youth
to
make
love
to
the
girl
and
learn
the
secret
this
he
failed
to
do
owing
perhaps
to
his
being
wanting
in
conviction
on
account
of
her
shaved
head
at
last
irala
and
his
friends
determined
to
send
the
governor
a
prisoner
to
spain
taking
care
of
course
to
despatch
a
messenger
beforehand
to
distort
the
facts
and
prejudice
the
king
the
friends
of
nunez
however
managed
to
secrete
a
box
of
papers
stating
the
true
facts
on
board
the
ship
at
dead
of
night
a
band
of
harquebusiers
dragged
him
from
his
bed
after
a
captivity
of
eleven
months
as
he
says
with
the
candle
in
his
hand
in
a
dying
state
as
he
left
the
prison
he
fell
upon
his
knees
and
thanked
god
for
having
let
him
once
more
feel
the
air
of
heaven
and
then
in
a
loud
voice
exclaimed
name
as
my
successor
captain
juan
de
salazar
de
espinosa
at
this
one
garci
vargas
rushed
at
him
with
a
knife
and
told
him
to
recall
his
words
or
he
would
kill
him
instantly
this
he
was
stopped
from
doing
and
nunez
was
hurried
to
the
ship
and
chained
securely
to
a
beam
on
board
the
vessel
he
says
they
tried
to
poison
him
but
this
seems
doubtful
as
there
was
nothing
on
earth
to
prevent
their
doing
so
had
they
been
so
inclined
still
as
a
prudent
man
he
took
the
precaution
to
provide
some
oil
and
a
piece
of
unicorn
de
unicornio
with
which
he
tried
the
food
unicorns
he
could
not
have
seen
in
paraguay
nor
yet
in
florida
and
he
does
not
explain
how
he
became
so
luckily

the

and

in
their
love
for
us
have
written
to
us
of
certain
birds
which
they
desire
we
will
send
them
for
the
king
we
are
sorry
not
to
have
them
to
send
inasmuch
as
they
live
where
god
made
them
in
the
forests
and
fly
far
away
from
us
so
that
we
can
not
catch
them
withal
we
are
the
vassals
of
god
and
of
the
king
and
always
desirous
to
fulfil
the
wishes
of
his
minister
so
we
pray
to
god
that
that
best
of
birds
the
holy
ghost
may
descend
upon
the
king
furthermore
we
desire
to
say
that
the
spanish
custom
is
not
to
our
liking
for
everyone
to
take
care
of
himself
instead
of
helping
one
another
in
their
daily
toil
this
quaint
and
touching
letter
was
written
originally
in
guarani
and
is
preserved
at
buenos
ayres
best
of
birds
the
holy
ghost
shows
faith
grounded
at
least
on
ornithology
and
the
whole
spirit
of
the
simple
document
is
as
pathetic
as
its
unconscious
philosophy
is
true
none
the
less
of
all
the
discoverers
of
america
he
is
the
man
of
least
imaginative
power
that
is
in
matters
appertaining
to
natural
history
so
one
must
conclude
he
had
his
piece
of
unicorn
from
spain
where
he
most
probably
had
bought
it
from
some
dealer
in
necessaries
for
travellers
to
the
new
world
after
a
stormy
voyage
he
arrived
in
spain
to
find
his
accusers
just
before
him
with
truly
eastern
justice
both
accusers
and
accused
were
put
in
gaol
a
custom
worthy
of
adoption
in
other
lands
nunez
was
soon
released
on
bail
and
his
accusers
having
all
died
in
eight
years
time
he
was
triumphantly
acquitted
of
all
the
charges
brought
against
him
to
prove
however
that
justice
is
and
always
has
been
blind
the
king
never
restored
him
to
his
government
in
paraguay
and
as
nunez
says
forgot
to
repay
him
what
he
had
expended
in
his
service
with
alvar
nunez
was
lost
the
only
chance
of
liberal
treatment
to
the
indians
for
from
his
time
the
governors
instead
of
being
men
of
the
world
above
the
petty
spite
of
party
differences
were
chosen
either
from
officers
who
having
served
in
the
frontier
wars
quite
naturally
looked
on
the
indians
as
enemies
or
were
appointed
by
intriguing
ministers
at
court
from
the
death
of
alvar
nunez
to
the
inauguration
of
the
missions
by
the
jesuits
no
one
arose
to
take
the
indians
side
and
it
may
be
that
had
his
policy
prevailed
there
would
have
been
an
indian
population
left
in
the
mission
territory
of
paraguay
for
had
the
civil
governors
with
the
jesuits
the
dispersion
of
the
indians
which
took
place
at
the
expulsion
of
the
jesuits
had
not
occurred

y

alvar

died
holding
the
office
of

de
sevilla
according
to
del
techo
del
paraguay
or
as
a
member
of
the
consejo
de
indias
according
to
charlevoix
thus
was
domingo
martinez
de
irala
left
in
sole
command
in
paraguay
he
naturally
had
all
to
gain
by
not
communicating
with
spain
had
he
done
so
the
part
he
played
in
reference
to
alvar
nunez
must
have
been
known
he
had
however
certain
good
qualities
courage
in
abundance
herculean
strength
and
great
endurance
and
the
power
of
making
himself
obeyed
but
he
had
to
justify
himself
to
spain
for
his
position
and
the
surest
way
to
do
so
was
to
discover
so
naming
francisco
de
mendoza
his
lieutenant
he
started
up
the
paraguay
taking
with
him
three
hundred
and
fifty
soldiers
and
two
thousand
guaranis
after
many
hardships
he
reached
the
frontiers
of
peru
only
to
find
the
country
already
conquered
from
the
pacific
side
and
to
be
met
by
the
messengers
of
the
wise
president
la
gasca
who
told
him
to
return
and
named
one
diego
centeno
governor
of
paraguay
instead
of
him
centeno
died
before
he
could
assume
the
governorship
so
it
seemed
that
fate
determined
that
irala
was
to
continue
in
command
after
a
year
and
a
half
he
returned
to
paraguay
having
found
no
gold
or
riches
but
bringing
many
thousand
indians
as
slaves
it
is
important
to
remember
that
irala
who
was
remarkable
for
his
relatively
kind
treatment
of
the
indians
on
this
occasion
led
so
many
of
them
captive
on
arriving
at
asuncion
he
found
a
rebellion
going
on
as
not
infrequently
occurred
when
a
spanish
governor
left
his
domains
his
lieutenant
mendoza
had
been
killed
by
one
diego
de
abreu
after
quieting
matters
in
asuncion
he
despatched
nuflo
de
chaves
one
of
his
captains
to
found
a
town
on
the
higher
waters
of
the
paraguay
like
many
other
captains
of
those
days
the
idea
of
chaves
was
to
make
himself
quite
independent
of
authority
so
striking
into
the
interior
he
founded
the
town
of
santa
cruz
de
la
sierra
in
bolivia
after
many
adventures
he
was
killed
by
an
indian
who
struck
him
with
a
club
whilst
he
was
sitting
eating
without
his
helmet
irala
died
at
the
little
village
of
ita
in
and
was
buried
in
the
cathedral
at
asuncion
which
he
was
building
at
the
time
with
him
expired
the
generation
of
the
conquering
soldiers
of
fortune
who
schooled
in
the
wars
of
italy
brought
to
america
some
of
the
virtues
and
all
the
vices
of
the
old
world
after
him
began

who
had
appealed
for

to

they
reached
the

and
began
their
labours
shortly
afterwards
they
were
joined
by

shortly

then

penetrated
into
the

to

seeing
the

called
all
the
scattered
jesuits

at

to
deliberate
as
to
their
future
policy
in
father
diego
torres
was
named
provincial
of
the
jesuits
of
paraguay
and
chile
thus
proving
both
the
paucity
of
jesuits
in
south
america
at
the
time
and
the
little
idea
the
general
in
rome
had
of
the
immensity
of
the
countries
he
was
dealing
with
before
this
date
the
jesuits
in
paraguay
had
been
under
the
ecclesiastical
jurisdiction
of
the
bishops
of
peru
torres
arrived
in
lima
with
fifteen
priests
and
almost
at
the
same
time
some
others
arrived
at
buenos
ayres
both
parties
proceeded
to
paraguay
already
the
jesuits
found
themselves
a
prey
to
calumny
both
in
tucuman
and
paraguay
they
were
expected
to
lend
themselves
to
the
enslavement
of
the
indians
in
chile
father
valdivia
was
expelled
from
santiago
and
took
refuge
at
tucuman
there
he
found
the
condition
of
affairs
so
intolerable
that
he
went
to
madrid
to
solicit
the
protection
of
the
king
philip
for
his
indian
subjects
in
philip
issued
his
royal
letters

to
the

for
the

of

in
the
province
of
guayra
the
bishop
and
the
governor
arias
de
saavedra
himself
a
paraguayan
by
birth
offered
no
objection
and
the
scheme
of
colonization
was
agreed
upon
at
once
thus
the
jesuits
obtained
their
first
official
status
in

fathers

the

or
according
to
others
the
parana
without

there
they
met
the
indians
amongst
whom
fields
and
ortega
had
begun
to
labour
and
there
they
founded
the
of

the
first

establishment
instituted
by
the
jesuits
amongst
the
guaranis
thus
in
the
woods
of
paraguay
upon
a
tributary
of
the

but
little
known
even
did
the

lay
the
first
foundation
of
their
famous
missions
but
little
more
than
fifty
years
from
the
foundation

thus
had
they
penetrated
to
what
was
then
and
is
perchance
after
their
missions
all
are
ruined
one

the
remotest
corners

the
spanish

for

which
their

for
ever
the
system
which
for
two
hundred
years
was
able
to
hold
together
wandering
indian
tribes
restless
as
arabs
suspicious
above
every
other
race

perhaps
not
quite

the

but
when

and
cataldino
arrived
at
guayra
and
founded
the
reduction

their
success
at
first
was
of
a
nature
that
almost
justified
the
epithet
an
epithet
which
indeed
all
men
apply
to
any
enterprise
of
theirs
which
meets
success
almost
from
the
first
inception
of
the
missions
the
jesuits
found
themselves
in
the
strange
position
of
though
being
hated
by
the
spanish
settlers
yet
recurred
to
as
mediators
when
any
of
the
wild
tribes
proved
too
powerful
for
the
spanish
arms
thus
far
from
cities
far
from
even
such
elementary
civilization
as
paraguay
should
show
almost
upon
the
edge
of
the
great
cataract
of
the
parana
the
jesuits
founded
their
first
reduction
to
which
the
indians
flocked
in
such
numbers
that
a
second
was
soon
necessary
to
which
they
gave
the
name
of
san
ignacio
in
memory
of
the
founder
of
their
rule
some
of
the
spanish
writers
refer
to
filds
as
padre
tom
filds
his
real
name
was
fields
and
he
was
a
scotchman
for
the
first
few
years
all
went
well
with
the
jesuits
the
indians
happy
to
escape
the
persecutions
of
the
spaniards
on
the
one
hand
and
the
incursions
of
the
on
the
other
flocked
to
the
reductions
mission
after
mission
was
soon
formed
and
the
wild
indians
gathered
up
into
townships
and
taught
the
arts
of
peace
but
though
the
guaranis
at
first
entered
into
the
jesuit
reductions
as
a
refuge
against
their
persecutors
the
portuguese
and
spaniards
soon
as
was
only
natural
to
men
accustomed
to
a
wild
forest
life
they
found
the
jesuit
discipline
too
irksome
and
often
fled
back
to
the
woods
then
the
poor
priest
left
without
his
flock
had
to
take
up
the
trail
of
the
flying
neophytes
follow
them
to
the
recesses
of
the
forests
and
persuade
them
to
come
back
the
paulistas
were
the
inhabitants
of
the
portuguese
now
brazilian
town
of
sao
paulo
azara
who
hated
the
jesuits
his
brother
don
nicolas
de
azara
having
been
concerned
in
their
expulsion
says
that
fear
of
the
paulistas
contributed
to
the
success
of
the
jesuits
with
the
indians
dean
funes
del
paraguay
etc
says
just
as
reasonably
that
it
was
fear
of
the
spanish
settlers
as
a
means
to
secure
the
confidence
of
the
indians
the
jesuits
found
themselves
obliged
to
communicate
as
rarely
as
possible
with
the
spanish
settlements
thus
from
the
first
the
policy
of
isolation
which
was
one
of
the
chief
charges
brought
against
the
order
in
later
years
was
of
necessity
begun
voltaire
no
lover
of
religious
orders
says
of
the
jesuits
in
the
missions
of
paraguay
left
the
hands
of
the
jesuits
they
had
arrived
at
perhaps
the
highest
degree
of
civilization
to
which
it
is
possible
to
conduct
a
young
people
and
certainly
at
a
far
superior
state
than
that
which
existed
in
the
rest
of
the
new
hemisphere
the
laws
were
respected
there
morals
were
pure
a
happy
brotherhood
united
every
heart
all
the
useful
arts
were
in
a
flourishing
state
and
even
some
of
the
more
agreeable
sciences
plenty
was
universal
there
was
however
a
royal
order
real
which
applied
to
all
america
which
especially
prohibited
spaniards
from
living
in
the
indian
towns
and
moreover
provided
that
even
for
purposes
of
trade
no
spaniard
should
remain
for
more
than
three
days
in
an
indian
town

it
is
however
to
be
remembered
that
voltaire
wrote
as
a
philosopher
and
not
as
an
economist
and
that
his
statement
most
probably
would
be
traversed
by
those
who
see
advancement
rather
in
material
improvement
than
in
moral
happiness
for
without
doubt
in
lima
and
in
mexico
upon
the
whole
society
must
have
made
amongst
the
spanish
and
citizens
greater
advances
than
in
the
jesuit
reductions
of
paraguay
in
some
respects
their
almost
inaccessible
situation
close
to
the
cataract
of
the
parana
was
favourable
to
the
early
jesuits
and
in
quick
succession
the
villages
of
loreto
san
francisco
xavier
san
jose
san
ignacio
san
pedro
and
others
of
less
importance
were
founded
containing
in
all
about
forty

so
in
the
jesuit
reductions
of
the
province
of
guayra
was
first
begun
the
system
of
treating
the
indians
kindly
and
standing
between
them
and
the
spanish
settlers
which
made
the
company
of
jesus
so
hated
afterwards
in
paraguay
little
by
little
their
influence
grew
so
that
when
in
padre
antonio
ruiz
de
montoya
arrived
he
found
that
there
were
already
one
hundred
and
nineteen
jesuits
in
guayra
and
in
paraguay
of
all
the
jesuits
who
during
the
long
period
of
their
labours
appeared
in
paraguay
he
was
the
most
remarkable
one
of
the
most
learned
men
of
the
age
in
which
he
lived
he
yet
united
in
himself
the
qualities
of
a
man
of
action
to
those
of
scholar
and
of
missionary
without
his
presence
most
likely
not
a
tenth
part
of
the
indians
would
have
escaped
after
the
destruction
of
the
missions
of
guayra
in
and
at
the
hands
of
the
hordes
known
as
paulistas
or
mamalucos
who
from
the
city
of
san
paulo
carried
fire
and
sword
amongst
the
guaranis
it
is
easy
to
understand
that
the
spanish
colonists
who
had
looked
on
all
the
indians
as
slaves
were
rendered
furious
by
the
advent
of
the
jesuits
who
treated
them
as
men
the
european
colonist
in
africa
labours
less
to
enslave
than
to
exterminate
the
natives
but
if
a
body
of
clergy
of
any
sect
having
the
abnegation
and
disregard
of
consequences
of
the
jesuits
of
old
should
arise
fancy
the
fury
that
would
be
evoked
if
they
insisted
that
it
were
as
truly
murder
to
slay
a
black
man
as
it
is
to
kill
a
man
whose
skin
is
white
most
fortunately
our
clergy
of
especially
those
of
the
various
churches
militant
in
uganda
think
otherwise
and
hold
that
christ
was
the
first
inventor
of
the
at
the
first
settlement
of
south
america
great
fiefs
called
were
granted
to
the
conquerors
one
of
the
conditions
of
their
tenure
was
that
the
the
owners
of
the
fiefs
see
to
the
religious
education
of
the
indians
much
the
same
kind
of
thing
as
to
enjoin
kindness
and
christian
forbearance
upon
the
directors
of
a
modern
chartered
company
but
in
addition
to
the
two
other
systems
were
in
vogue
called
and
which
were
in
fact
designed
to
reduce
the
indians
to
the
condition
of
mere
slaves
says
that
the
yanaconas
were
men
destined
from
birth
to
perpetual
slavery
and
captivity
and
in
their
clothing
treatment
and
the
conditions
of

were

so

was
the

be
fatal

the

upon
being
drawn

disposed

not

divorced

the
were
at
the
beginning

who
had
not

had

by
the
abuses

so
diminished
the
number

that

was
named
by
the

report
upon

to

declared
that

should
not

of
and
it
abolished
in
their
favour
the
forced

which
they
had
previously
endured
the
european
settlers
in

thought
that
this
was
owing
to
the
influence
of
the
jesuits
and
therefore
they
expelled
them
from
the
town
recalled
to
santiago
they
founded
there
a

those
who
remained
in

pushed
on
the
points
out
that
the
first
twenty
reductions
founded
by
the
company
of

were
settled
in

twenty

in

at

on

in

upon

on

excellent

fighters
they
subsisted
chiefly
by
procuring
indians
as

for
the
plantations
in
brazil
in
a
short
time
they
exhausted
all
the
indians
near
san
paulo
and
were
forced
to
search
far
in
the
depths
of
the
unknown
interior
little
by
little
following
the
course
of
the
great
rivers
in
their
canoes
they
reached
the
jesuit
settlements
upon
the
upper
waters
of
the
parana
where
they
burned
the
towns
and
the
churches
made
captives
of
the
converts
and
killed
the
priests
montoya
relates
that
a
jesuit
having
clasped
an
indian
in
his
arms
to
save
him
was
deluged
with
his
blood
a
mameluco
having
crept
up
behind
him
and
plunged
his
lance
into
the
indian
behind
the
jesuit
back
the
mameluco
on
being
as
montoya
says
by
the
jesuit
dogmatically
remarked
shall
be
saved
in
spite
of
god
for
to
be
saved
a
man
has
only
to
believe
a
remark
which
showed
him
clearly
an
honest
opponent
of
the
jesuits
as
they
insisted
greatly
on
the
doctrine
of
good
works
the
word
in
brazil
is
used
to
designate
a
but
the
etymology
seems
unknown

and
others
tell
us
that
the
plan
of
action
of
the
paulistas
was
either
to
attack
the
jesuit
reductions
on
sunday
when
the
sheep
were
gathered
in
the
fold
listening
to
mass
surround
the
church
murder
the
priest
and
carry
off
the
neophytes
as
slaves
or
else
disguised
as
jesuits
enter
a
mission
gain
the
confidence
of
the
indians
and
then
communicate
with
their
soldiers
who
were
waiting
in
the
woods
but
not
content
with
this
it
seems
so
often
did
they
practise
singing
mass
to
pass
as
jesuits
that
on
returning
to
san
paulo
in
their
orgies
their
great
diversion
was
to
masquerade
as
priests
so
that
the
rascals
not
only
profited
by
their
villainy
but
extracted
much
amusement
from
their
wicked
deeds
this
in
montoya
opinion
was
even
more
damnable
than
the
actual
crime
and
so
no
doubt
it
was
and
we
in
england
by
having
made
our
vice
as
dull
as
virtue
is
in
other
lands
have
gone
some
way
towards
morality
for
vice
and
virtue
both
deprived
of
humour
become
not
so
far
separated
as
some
virtuous
dull
folk
may
think
the
mamelucos
sometimes
pushed
their
forays
right
through
paraguay
into
the
district
of
the
moxos
and
padre
patricio
fernandez
in
his
curious
de
los
indios
chiquitos
madrid
relates
their
adventures
in
that
district
and
the
conflicts
which
the
indians
led
by
their
priests
and
helped
by
the
spanish
settlers
sustained
quite
naturally
these
redoubtable
land
and
river
pirates
saw
in
the
jesuit
reductions
upon
the
paranapane
and
generally
throughout
the
district
of
guayra
merely
an
opportunity
of
capturing
more
indians
than
usual
at
a
haul
in
they
first
appeared
before
the
mission
of
san
antonio
and
destroyed
it
utterly
burning
the
church
and
houses
and
driving
off
the
indians
to
sell
as
slaves
san

and
shortly
suffered
the
same
fate
in
concepcion
padre
salazar
was
regularly
besieged
and
he
and
all
the
people
reduced
to
eating
dogs
cats
rats
mice
and
even
snakes
at
the
last
moment
when
about
to
surrender
father
cataldino
hastily
arming
some
indians
with
any
rude
weapons
at
his
command
marched
on
the
place
and
raised
the
siege

this

the

honour
for
to
him
perhaps
as
much
as
to
any
of
these
first
explorers
of
the
upper
parana
is
credit
due
but
still
the
mamelucos
ran
their
course
destroying
town
after
town
so
that
in
the
short
space
of
a
year
they
destroyed
partially
the
reductions
of
san
francisco
xavier
san
jose
san
pedro
and
la
concepcion
and
the
two
first
founded
san
ignacio
and
loreto
were
ruined
utterly
the
wretched
indians
to
whom
by
law
the
jesuits
were
forbidden
to
serve
out
firearms
stood
no
chance
against
the
paulistas
with
their
horses
guns
and
bloodhounds
assisted
as
they
were
by
troops
of
savage
indians
who
discharged
poisoned
arrows
from
blowpipes
and
from
bows
small
wonder
that
as
montoya
charlevoix
lahier
and
filiberto
all
agree
despair
took
hold
of
them
so
that
in
many
instances
they
cursed
the
jesuits
and
fled
back
to
the
woods
when
one
reflects
that
many
of
the
indian
tribes
looked
upon
baptism
as
a
poison
it
is
not
strange
that
they
should
have
associated
effect
with
cause
and
set
down
all
their
sufferings
to
the
influence
of
the
malignant
rite
to
which
the
jesuits
had
subjected
them
the
isolated
jesuits
ran
considerable
risk
from
their
own
sheep
and
padre
mola
after
the
ruin
of
san
antonio
was
suspected
by
them
of
being
in
league
with
the
paulistas
and
had
to
flee
for
safety
to
another
town
and
as
a
touch
of
comedy
is
seldom
wanting
to
make
things
bitterer
to
those
in
misfortune
a
troop
of
savage
indians
having
arrived
to
attack
the
reduction
of
san
antonio
and
finding
it
already
burning
instantly
thought
poor
padre
mola
had
been
the
instigator
and
starting
on
his

almost
surprised
him

been

gathering
the

and
then
again
catching
sight
of
a

it
slunk
beside

all
the

convinced
that
all
their
efforts
like
the
efforts
of

of
those
who
strive
would
be
in

so
stumbling
through
the
woods
crossing
the
rivers
on
inflated
baked
by
the
sun
upon
the
open
plains
at
length
the
jesuits
reached
san

where
they
had
a
college
and
without
resting
set
at
once
to
work
in

and
what
in
cases
of
the
kind
is
ten
times
more
important

from

they
started
for

to

the
of

they
were
told
that
the
right
person
to
address
was
the
of
the
colony
who
had
his
residence
in

five
or
six
hundred
miles
away

daunted
they
set

more
or
less
friendly
but
as
usual
fearful
of
giving
offence
to
those
who
had
a
vested
interest
in
the
trade
then
the
two
jesuits
hearing
that
another
invasion
of
the
paulistas
was
expected
in
guayra
started
back
on
their
long
journey
through
the
woods
over
the
plains
across
the
mountain
ranges
and
through
the
dank
which
lay
between
them
and
their
missions
on
the
parana

seems
to
have
been
roused
to
a
sense
of
the
position

their
words

on
his
annual
visitation

he
spoke
in
public
to
the
colonists
against
their
slave
raids
when
a
shot
fired
from
the
meeting
ended
his
speech
the
inhabitants
then

to
him
that
sooner
than
give
up
what
seemed
to
them
a
justifiable
and
honest
means
of
life
they
would
be
debaptized
how
they
proposed
to
debaptize
themselves

not
related

perhaps
after

of
the
guaranis

scraping
with
a

though
why
the
tongue
should
be
thus

doubtful
for
no
sect
of
christians
that
is
known
exacts
that
people
at
that
sacrament
should
put
out
their
tongues

even

does
little

nothing

set
out
upon

by

enough
to
appal
the
boldest
traveller
walking
along
he
found
himself
about
the
middle
of
his
way
alone
his
indians
having
loitered
in
the
rear
night
caught
him
in
the
forests
and
a
storm
came
on
he
passed
the
night
at
the
foot
of
a
large
tree
hungry
and
wet
and
waking
in
the
morning
found
himself
so
crippled
with
arthritic
pains
as
to
be
obliged
to
continue
his
journey
on
his
hands
and
knees
alone
and
helpless
he
dragged
himself
to
a
place
called
maracayu
and
failing
to
obtain
a
canoe
went
on
another
league
and
there
lay
down
to
die
his
leg
being
swelled
enormously
with
the
rheumatic
pains
then
as
he
says
himself
he
prayed
to
san
ignacio
telling
him
that
from
a
sentiment
of
obedience
he
had
set
out
upon
the
journey
through
the
waste
nothing
could
have
been
better
for
the
saint
who
must
have
seen
him
all
the
time
flattered
perhaps
that
his
own
chief
virtue
had
been
the
cause
of
so
much
pain
promptly
healed
him
and
restored
his
leg
to
its
usual
size
and
montoya
went
on
his
way
rejoicing
to
asuncion
the
provincial
heard
and
was
disabused
but
was
unable
to
send
a
single
man
to
help
and
poor
montoya
set
off
again
back
to

alone
having
gained
nothing
but
his
sufferings
on
the
road
again

him

calumnies
spread
by

a
strange
circumstance
indian
he
says
intelligence
and
pious
conduct
called
me
to
administer
the
last
sacraments
and
to
confess
him
before
he
died
and
this
i
did
as
there
seemed
little
hope
of
his
recovery
and
pressing
business
called
me
away
i
quitted
him
after
having
given
orders
for
his
burial
he
died
in
a
short
time
at
least
all
those
who
were
with
him
had
no
doubt
of
this
on
my
return
i
found
the
man
whom
i
had
charged
to
stay
beside
the
indian
till
his
death
preparing
for
his
funeral
toward
they
came
to
tell
me
that
the
dead
man
had
come
to
life
and
wished
to
speak
to
me
i
ran
there
and
found
him
with
a
cheerful
face
in
the
middle
of
a
crowd
of
indians
i
asked
him
what
had
happened
since
i
last
saw
him
and
he
answered
me
that
the
instant
that
i
quitted
him
his
soul
had
taken
its
departure
from
his
body
then
at
a
point
which
he
thought
near
to
his
hammock
a
devil
had
appeared
who
said
to
him
you
are
my
prey
and
that
he
answered
it
could
not
be
for
he
had
confessed
himself
to
the
best
of
his
ability
and
had
received
the
holy
viaticum
before
his
death
that
the
devil
had
sustained
that
his
confession
had
been
incomplete
and
that
he
had
forgotten
to
confess
that
twice
he
had
been
drunk
to
which
he
answered
that
it
was
an
oversight
and
he
hoped
that
god
would
not
remember
it
then
on
the
devil
sustaining
that
he
had
committed
a
sacrilege
peter
had
appeared
followed
by
angels
and
driven
off
the
fiend
i
asked
him
how
he
had
known
peter
and
he
replied
by
describing
him
though
he
had
never
seen
an
image
of
the
saint
the
saint
he
said
covered
me
with
his
mantle
and
i
felt
myself
instantly
carried
through
the
air
first
i
perceived
a
lovely
landscape
and
further
on
a
great
city
from
which
a
shining
light
appeared
then
the
apostle
and
the
angels
stopped
and
the
first
said
to
me
is
the
city
of
the
lord
we
live
here
with
him
but
the
time
of
your
entry
is
not
yet
it
is
written
that
your
soul
shall
once
more
join
your
body
and
in
three
days
you
must
appear
in
church
then
all
was
dark
and
in
an
instant
i
woke
up
alive
and
well
espiritual
says
montoya
by
the
last
words
of
peter
that
the
man
had
to
die
in
three
days
and
i
asked
what
he
thought
himself
i
think
said
he
that
next
sunday
they
will
carry
my
body
to
the
church
and
i
am
certain
that
i
only
returned
to
life
in
order
to
exhort
my
relatives
and
my
friends
to
listen
to
your
instructions
when
sunday
came
he
made
his
general
confession
admitted
the
two
sins
the
devil
had
reproached
him
with
exhorted
all
to
live
a
christian
life
and
a
few
moments
afterwards
quietly
gave
up
the
ghost
this
time
it
is
to
be
hoped
without
omissions
this
is
the
sole
occasion
on
which
padre
ruiz
montoya
even
remotely
touches
the
field
of
miracles
as
he
in
general
relies
upon
himself
his
knowledge
of
the
world
and
on
his
patience
which
must
have
been
almost
north
british
in
its
quality
if
he
acted
up
to
his
own
favourite
maxim
of
returning
thanks
for
injuries
is
how
wise
men
conduct
their
business
gracias
por
agravios
negocian
los
hombres
sabios
in
we
find
him
praying
father
cataldino
to
let
him
accompany
the
expedition
to
itiranbaru
a
mountain
wooded
to
the
summit
in
which
lived
several
wild
tribes
there
he
so
worked
upon
the
indians
as
to
establish
them
in
a
reduction
under
the
title
of
francis
xavier
and
left
the
mountain
which
had
been
a
haunt
of
savages
as
padre
del
techo
says
in
his
curious
work
on
paraguay
at
the
service
of
the
lord
soon
afterwards
ruined
by
the
paulistas
in
whilst
preaching
he
was
suddenly
assailed
by
hostile
indians
and
seven
of
his
indians
pierced
with
arrows
at
his
feet
undoubtedly
he
must
have
been
killed
had
not
an
indian
taken
his
hat
and
cloak
and
run
into
the
middle
of
the
enemy
to
distract
the
fire
in
the
confusion
both
the
heroic
indian
and
montoya
managed
to
escape
the
latter
getting
into
a
canoe
which
fortunately
was
ready
at
the
but
in
the
midst
of
all
his
occupations
he
had
time
to
study
natural
history
in
the
spirit
of
the
time
as
the
following
description
clearly
shows
the
other
rarities
of
the
land
is
an
amphibious
animal
it
is
like
a
sheep
with
but
the
difference
that
its
teeth
and
nails
are
like
a
tiger
which
animal
it
equals
in
ferocity
the
indians
never
look
on
it
without
terror
and
when
it
sallies
from
the
marshes
where
it
lives
which
it
does
ordinarily
in
troops
they
have
no
other
chance
of
escape
but
to
climb
up
a
tree
and
even
then
sometimes
are
not
in
safety
for
this
terrible
creature
sometimes
uproots
the
tree
or
sometimes
stays
on
guard
until
the
indian
falls
into
its
jaws
thus
far
montoya
but
charlevoix
informs
us
that
langue
guaranie
it
is
known
as
the
and
rather
tamely
adds
one
of
these
animals
is
slain
the
people
make
a
jacket
of
its
skin
again
montoya
tells
us
of
the
horse
on
which
the
venerable
padre
roque
used
to
ride
which
when
he
died
refused
all
food
and
wept
perpetually
two
streams
of
water
running
from
its
eyes
it
never
allowed
an
indian
to
mount
it
after
its
master
death
and
finally
expired
close
to
his
grave
of
grief
a
kindly
scholarly
intrepid
priest
well
skilled
in
knowledge
of
the
world
and
not
without
some
tincture
of
studies
in
science
as
the
anecdotes
reveal
to
us
no
doubt
the
indians
loved
him
far
and
wide
and
his
superiors
stood
in
some
little
awe
of
him
as
those
in
office
often
do
of
their
subordinates
when
they
show
that
capacity
for
action
which
is
a
sure
bar
to
advancement
either
in
church
or
state
in
montoya
was
made
head
of
the
missions
in
guayra
which
opened
up
to
him
the
opportunity
of
showing
what
kind
of
man
he
was
in
this
year
the
spaniards
of
villa
rica
the
nearest
town
in
paraguay
to
the
reductions
in
guayra
sent
out
an
expedition
to
chastize
some
indians
who
had
insulted
a
chief
called
tayaoba
whom
montoya
had
baptized
this
was
the
pretext
for
the
expedition
but
montoya
knew
well
that
the
real
object
was
to
hunt
for
slaves
he
brought
before
the
governor
the
edict
of
the
king
of
spain
forbidding
any
war
to
be
made
upon
the
indians
without
sufficient
cause
all
was
in
vain
and
the
expedition
left
villa
rica
and
plunged
into
the
wilds
montoya
sore
against
the
governor
desire
went
with
the
expedition
taking
with
him
padre
salazar
and
some
indians
it
was
lucky
for
the
spaniards
that
he
was
there
for
on
the
second
day
a
flight
of
arrows
burst
from
a
wood
and
wounded
many
of
them
the
captain
of
the
expedition
ordered
a
retreat
which
situated
as
they
were
exposed
on
all
sides
to
the
fire
of
an
enemy
whom
they
could
not
see
must
have
proved
fatal
montoya
counselled
throwing
up
earthworks
before
some
huts
which
stood
upon
the
edge
of
the
woods
in
which
the
indians
were
this
done
he
sent
a
messenger
to
villa
rica
for
reinforcements
even
behind
the
earthworks
the
spaniards
were
hard
pressed
no
one
could
show
himself
without
being
pierced
by
an
arrow
the
number
of
the
indians
daily
increased
till
on
the
third
day
they
numbered
about
four
thousand
and
seemed
likely
to
advance
upon
the
huts
the
spanish
captain
ordered
a
rally
and
the
neophytes
wished
to
decamp
taking
montoya
with
them
and
then
gain
the
shelter
of
the
woods
this
he
would
not
allow
and
charging
with
the
soldiers
put
the
indians
to
flight
the
spaniards
far
from
being
grateful
for
their
lives
seeing
their
hopes
of
making
prisoners
had
vanished
wished
to
lay
hands
upon
the
indians
whom
montoya
had
brought
and
who
had
fought
beside
them
in
the
recent
fray
hearing
that
in
the
morning
the
spanish
soldiers
would
attack
his
neophytes
montoya
sent
them
off
by
night
and
in
the
morning
when
the
spanish
captain
found
him
and
the
other
priest
alone
he
said
you
had
no
other
use
for
the
indians
i
advised
them
to
return
the
captain
had
the
grace
to
say
nothing
but
you
gave
them
good
advice
my
father
the
two
priests
waited
patiently
till
the
soldiers
had
retired
and
then
sent
for
their
indians
and
quietly
went
home
thus
it
appears
that
at
necessity
padre
montoya
was
a
true
son
of
san
ignacio
in
montoya
seems
to
have
met
for
the
first
time
padre
diaz
tano
who
afterwards
was
his
companion
both
in
the
retreat
from
guayra
down
the
parana
and
in
his
mission
to
the
king
no
matter
whether
a
man
make
his
career
with
indians
in
the
wilds
of
paraguay
or
amongst
the
reasoning
people
in
more
sophisticated
lands
if
he
once
show
himself
superior
to
the
ordinary
run
of
men
there
is
something
of
an
invidious
character
certain
to
be
attributed
to
him
by
those
who
think
that
genius
is
the
worst
attribute
that
man
can
have
this
montoya
did
not
escape
from
amongst
the
spaniards
but
the
indians
at
least
were
less
envious
being
perhaps
less
educated
for
they
believed
that
the
soul
of
one
of
their
known
in
his
life
as
quaratici
had
entered
into
him
the
rumour
reached
at
last
a
chief
called
guiravera
known
to
the
spaniards
as
the
from
his
cruelty
who
hearing
that
the
soul
of
his
late
rival
had
entered
into
montoya
came
to
see
him
at
the
head
of
a
large
retinue
of
people
of
his
tribe
montoya
and
maceta
were
at
villa
rica
and
on
the
chief
approach
they
happened
to
be
seated
in
the
plaza
of
the
town
as
he
approached
them
followed
by
his
men
and
with
a
threatening
air
they
remained
seated
merely
motioning
him
to
take
a
seat
upon
a
bench
this
he
did
after
making
one
of
his
men
cover
the
seat
with
a
and
stand
behind
on
guard
what
passed
between
them
most
unluckily
montoya
has
not
set
down
what
he
has
told
us
only
makes
us
wish
for
more
for
it
appears
that
after
the
usual
salutations
guiravera
refused
to
speak
and
getting
up
walked
about
the
town
silently
looking
at
everything
but
as
it
ever
happens
even
montoya
was
no
exception
to
the
general
run
of
who
usually
are
occupied
alone
with
facts
which
seem
to
them
important
at
the
time
forgetting
that
posterity
for
whom
they
write
can
judge
of
the
result
as
well
as
they
themselves
but
thirst
for
details
to
complete
the
chain
betwixt
them
and
their
predecessors
one
thing
is
set
down
not
by
montoya
but
by
another
jesuit
that
is
the
sermon
which
montoya
preached
to
bring
the
chief
into
the
fold
considered
as
a
sermon
it
does
not
seem
out
of
the
common
way
and
judged
by
its
results
was
futile
at
the
time
for
the
chief
answered
coldly
that
he
would
think
the
matter
over
and
then
retired
into
the
woods
but
the
seed
thus
sown
in
villa
rica
was
to
bear
fruit
for
in
a
year
the
chief
either
tired
of
his
ancestral
gods
or
having
pondered
on
the
sermon
came
into
the
fold
and
was
baptized
as
paul
chief
an
of
the
mamelucos
called
father
montoya
from
baptizing
indians
and
recovering
their
souls
to
the
more
prosaic
if
as
useful
task
of
saving
their
bodies
which
he
did
at
the
immediate
peril
of
his
own
the
mamelucos
had
appeared
before
the
reduction
of
encarnacion
and
many
of
the
indians
had
already
taken
refuge
in
the
woods
those
who
remained
were
like
a
flock
of
sheep
without
a
shepherd
and
knew
not
what
to
do
padre
montoya
hastened
to
the
spot
and
called
on
every
christian
to
take
up
arms
under
the
circumstances
he
undoubtedly
was
right
still
in
reading
history
one
is
puzzled
to
observe
how
often
and
in
how
many
different
countries
christians
have
to
resort
to
arms
but
before
proceeding
to
extremities
montoya
sent
out
fathers
mendoza
and
domenecchi
with
some
of
the
principal
inhabitants
of
the
reduction
to
parley
with
the
mamelucos
who
under
their
celebrated
leader
antonio
raposo
were
encamped
outside
the
place
upon
arriving
within
range
of
the
paulista
camp
they
were
greeted
with
a
shower
of
balls
and
arrows
which
killed
several
of
the
indians
and
wounded
father
mendoza
in
the
foot
but
when
in
spite
of
his
wound
the
jesuit
advanced
towards
the
camp
and
insisted
on
speaking
with
the
leader
the
mamelucos
were
so
struck
with
his
courage
that
they
gave
up
to
him
several
of
the
indians
whom
they
had
taken
prisoners
upon
the
previous
day
next
day
father
montoya
encouraged
by
the
success
of
father
mendoza
went
out
himself
and
facing
the
paulistas
somewhat
imprudently
threatened
them
with
the
wrath
of
heaven
and
the
king
if
they
did
not
retire
the
wrath
of
heaven
is
often
somewhat
capricious
in
its
action
and
the
king
of
spain
although
as
wrathful
as
he
had
been
an
emperor
was
too
far
away
to
inspire
much
terror
in
his
subjects
on
the
parana
so
that
the
paulista
treated
the
wrath
of
both
their
majesties
as
qualities
which
he
could
well
neglect
and
for
sole
answer
ordered
his
men
to
march
upon
the
town
but
whether
owing
to
their
hard
hearts
having
been
touched
by
the
good
father
eloquence
or
the
fact
that
the
neophytes
were
under
arms
when
the
paulistas
arrived
close
to
the
town
they
altered
their
intentions
and
filed
off
into
the
woods
profiting
by
the
respite
from
hostilities
montoya
in
conjunction
with
padre
diaz
tano
and
a
father
bearing
the
somewhat
curious
name
of
padre
justo
vansurk
mansilla
devoted
all
his
attention
for
the
time
to
the
mission
of
santa
maria
la
mayor
which
was
the
most
flourishing
of
all
the
missions
of
the
time
and
which
still
shows
the
greatest
remnants
of
the
jesuits
work
both
in
regard
to
architecture
and
the
remains
of
indian
population
still
settled
on
the
old
mission
lands
but
even
there
the
jesuits
did
not
escape
without
their
trials
for
it
that
a
quantity
of
new
proselytes
arrived
with
women
whom
the
good
fathers
stigmatized
as
and
whom
the
ignorant
indians
in
the
innocence
of
their
hearts
looked
on
as
wives
the
order
being
given
to
dismiss
these
concubines
or
wives
a
few
submitted
but
the
rest
leaving
the
mission
started
cultivating
a
tract
of
land
in
the
vicinity
these
raids
were
known
as
in
paraguay
it
was
not
unusual
for
foreign
jesuits
to
hispaniolize
their
names
thus
smith
became
esmid
but
it
was
more
usual
to
add
a
spanish
name
as
appears
to
have
been
the
case
with
vansurk
mansilla
father
manuel
querini
in
his
report
to
the
king
of
spain
in
mentions
the
names
of
boxer
keiner
and
limp
with
many
other
french
english
and
german
names
amongst
those
of
priests
at
the
various
missions
montoya
espiritual
also
charlevoix
then
the
good
fathers
with
montoya
at
their
head
hit
on
a
stroke
of
genius
taking
the
opportunity
when
the
seceding
indians
were
away
gathering
their
crops
they
set
fire
to
their
houses
and
carried
off
the
children
and
the
women
back
to
the
mission
the
recalcitrants
appeared
next
day
at
santa
maria
la
mayor
and
were
received
again
into
the
bosom
of
the
church
heresy
also
now
and
then
made
its
appearance
for
two
rascals
having
built
two
temples
upon
two
hills
transported
to
them
the
skeletons
of
two
magicians
long
since
dead
and
the
fickle
people
left
the
churches
empty
and
went
to
worship
at
the
magicians
shrines
but
in
this
season
of
sorrow
and
of
care
and
whilst
the
churches
in
the
mission
of
encarnacion
were
left
deserted
montoya
once
again
showed
his
determination
and
put
things
right
not
being
able
to
cope
alone
with
the
heathen
father
diaz
tano
went
to
guayra
and
induced
montoya
still
the
superior
of
the
reductions
in
that
province
to
give
his
aid
he
came
and
having
armed
some
of
the
faithful
at
dead
of
night
attacked
the
temples
and
razed
them
to
the
ground
it
is
certain
that
the
guaranis
like
many
other
indians
were
polygamists
and
xarque
in
his
apostolica
del
joseph
cataldino
thus
explains
the
matter
tener
tanto
numero
de
concubinas
no
solamente
lo
ocasiona
su
natural
lascivo
sino
tambien
el
vicio
de
la
embriaguez
pues
teniendo
tantas
criadas
tenian
con
mas
abundancia
su
cerveza
y
vino
thus
xarque
seems
to
agree
with
the
late
miss
mary
kingsley
who
in
one
of
her
books
though
she
says
nothing
about
the
lascivo
of
the
negroes
of
the
west
coast
of
africa
seems
to
attribute
the
polygamy
of
the
negroes
to
the
difficulty
a
man
experiences
in
the
countries
in
which
she
travelled
in
getting
his
food
prepared
by
one
wife
in
montoya
and
others
came
in
the
forests
of
guayra
upon
the
wild
caaguas
these
they
strove
hard
to
civilize
but
after
labouring
long
with
all
their
eloquence
were
able
to
induce
only
eighteen
to
return
with
them
to
the
encarnacion
it
was
difficulty
that
they
were
able
to
give
them
a
sufficient
knowledge
of
the
mysteries
of
our
faith
to
be
able
to
bestow
the
rite
of
baptism
it
may
be
that
the
caaguas
not
having
much
to
occupy
their
minds
approached
the
mysteries
of
our
faith
in
more
receptive
attitudes
than
is
attained
by
those
whose
minds
are
full
but
anyhow
montoya
with
true
prudence
deferred
their
baptism
till
just
before
their
death
for
a
few
months
of
life
outside
the
forests
proved
fatal
to
them
all
faith
is
a
wondrous
thing
and
able
to
move
most
things
even
one
wonders
though
why
when
the
jesuits
learned
from
experience
that
the
poor
indians
invariably
died
when
exposed
to
the
burning
sun
upon
the
plains
they
continued
in
their
fatal
efforts
to
inflict
baptism
on
the
unoffending
people
of
the
woods
if
it
were
necessary
it
surely
might
have
taken
place
in
their
own
homes
and
the
patients
then
might
have
been
left
to
chance
to
see
how
the
reception
of
the
holy
rite
acted
upon
their
lives
in
the
mamelucos
broke
into
the
province
of
guayra
all
was
confusion
and
montoya
sent
father
diaz
tano
to
asuncion
to
beg
the
governor
don
luis
de
cespedes
to
send
them
help
he
answered
that
he
could
do
nothing
and
thus
by
leaving
the
whole
territory
of
guayra
without
defence
lost
a
rich
province
to
the
crown
of
spain
though
at
the
time
portugal
and
spain
were
united
yet
in
the
indies
their
subjects
were
at
war
and
though
in
europe
spain
was
the
stronger
of
the
two
in
america
the
portuguese
conquered
about
that
time
rich
provinces
which
form
part
of
the
quondam
empire
of
brazil
upon
the
failure
of
don
luis
de
cespedes
to
render
help
padre
diaz
tano
was
despatched
to
to
lay
the
matter
before
the
audiencia
real
the
high
court
of
the
indies
the
frequent
journeys
and
diplomatic
negotiations
in
which
the
jesuits
of
paraguay
were
engaged
rendered
them
far
more
apt
to
manage
business
than
members
of
the
other
orders
in
america
whilst
in
guayra
all
was
confusion
and
the
paulistas
swept
through
the
land
ruining
everything
upon
the
uruguay
things
prospered
and
padre
romero
founded
two
new
reductions
known
as
san
carlos
and
apostoles
he
also
laid
the
foundation
of
that
territory
in
which
the
persecuted
neophytes
of
guayra
were
soon
to
find
a
safe
retreat
father
diaz
tano
by
this
time
had
returned
from
charcas
with
a
decree
of
the
high
court
declaring
the
action
of
don
luis
de
cespedes
in
failing
to
protect
guayra
against
the
mamelucos
prejudicial
to
the
interests
of
the
king
but
as
neither
he
nor
the
high
court
of
charcas
possessed
any
power
by
means
of
which
to
stimulate
the
governor
to
greater
zeal
the
decree
was
useless
and
tano
and
ruiz
montoya
found
themselves
summoned
hastily
to
meet
a
new
attack
but
before
they
arrived
the
missions
both
of
san
francisco
xavier
and
of
san
jose
had
been
destroyed
as
there
were
still
three
reductions
undestroyed
montoya
as
provincial
of
guayra
called
all
the
jesuits
of
the
province
to
deliberate
as
to
their
chance
of
making
a
defence
the
debate
ran
high
some
of
the
priests
wished
that
the
neophytes
should
fight
to
the
end
others
more
sensible
pointed
out
that
the
and
quite
untrained
militia
of
the
missions
could
do
nothing
with
their
bows
and
arrows
against
the
and
paulistas
all
armed
with
guns
padre
truxillo
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
it
would
be
more
prudent
to
transport
the
indians
to
a
place
of
safety
and
pointed
out
that
near
the
cataract
of
guayra
they
would
be
able
to
cross
the
river
and
place
it
between
themselves
and
the
paulistas
in
case
of
an
attack
this
advice
seemed
prudent
to
the
rest
and
father
truxillo
set
out
to
make
his
preparation
for
the
march
few
european
travellers
even
have
visited
the
great
cataract
known
as
el
salto
de
guayra
or
in
portuguese
as
sete
quedas
bourgade
la
has
described
it
in
his
book
on
paraguay
situated
as
it
is
in
the
midst
of
almost
impenetrable
forests
it
has
not
even
now
been
properly
placed
upon
the
map
bourgade
la
dardye
inclines
to
think
he
was
the
first
to
visit
it
since
the
expedition
sent
by
the
elder
lopez
president
of
paraguay
under
lieutenant
patino
in
before
that
time
it
had
been
left
unvisited
since
when
the
boundary
commissioners
sent
to
determine
the
dividing
line
between
the
spanish
and
portuguese
possessions
camped
near
it
for
a
week
felix
de
azara
writes
about
it
in
his
del
paraguay
but
he
does
little
more
than
reproduce
the
account
given
by
the
boundary
commissioners
he
places
it
in
and
refers
to
it
as
tremendous
precipice
of
worthy
of
homer
or
of
virgil
pen
he
says
the
waters
do
not
fall
vertically
as
from
a
balcony
or
window
por
un
balcon
ventana
but
by
an
inclined
plane
at
an
inclination
of
about
fifty
degrees
the
river
close
to
the
top
of
the
falls
is
about
four
thousand
nine
hundred
castilian
yards
in
breadth
and
suddenly
narrows
to
about
seventy
yards
and
rushes
over
the
fall
with
such
terrific
violence
as
if
it
wished
to
the
centre
of
the
earth
and
cause
thus
the
nutation
which
astronomers
have
observed
in
the
earth
axis
the
dew
or
vapour
which
rises
from
the
fall
is
seen
in
the
shape
of
a
column
from
many
miles
away
and
on
it
hangs
a
perpetual
rainbow
which
trembles
as
the
earth
seems
to
tremble
under
one
feet
noise
he
says
heard
full
six
leagues
off
and
in
the
neighbourhood
neither
bird
nor
beast
is
found
in
azara
time
the
journey
was
not
too
pleasant
for
he
says
who
wishes
to
see
this
fall
must
cross
the
desert
for
thirty
leagues
from
the
town
of
curuguaty
to
the
river
guatimi
there
he
must
choose
trees
to
construct
canoes
in
these
he
must
embark
all
those
who
go
with
him
arms
and
provisions
and
besides
where
he
embarks
leave
an
armed
escort
to
secure
his
base
of
supplies
from
the
wild
indians
attack
in
the
canoes
he
then
must
navigate
the
guatimi
for
thirty
leagues
until
it
joins
the
parana
and
always
with
much
care
for
in
the
woods
upon
its
banks
are
indians
who
give
no
quarter
then
there
remain
three
leagues
to
sail
upon
the
parana
then
one
can
reach
the
falls
either
in
the
canoes
or
struggling
along
the
woods
which
fringe
the
river
bank
charcas
is
situated
in
what
is
now
bolivia
and
was
extremely
inconvenient
for
all
dwellers
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
andes
to
reach
whether
this
was
a
masterpiece
of
policy
calculated
to
discourage
lawsuits
or
whether
it
was
merely
due
to
spanish
incuriousness
and
maladministration
is
a
moot
point
the
indians
of
the
missions
were
not
allowed
to
possess
firearms
at
this
period

the

according
to

was
the
name
of
a
whom

was
perhaps
of
all
the
travellers
of
the
last
century
the
man
who
above
all
things
shines
in
accuracy
and
in
point
of
fact
his
description
of
the
cataract
is
the
best
we
have
up
to
the
present
time
bourgade
la
dardye
tells
us
that
not
far
above
the
cataract
the
parana
expands
into
a
lake
almost
five
miles
in
breadth
and
from
the
lake
the
river
issues
in
two
great
arms
which
have
forced
their
way
through
the
mountains
known
as
the
sierra
de
mbaracyu
bourgade
la
dardye
seems
to
think
the
circular
eddies
found
in
the
whirls
are
the
most
curious
features
of
the
falls
he
describes
them
thus
flow
in
falls
varying
from
fifty
to
sixty
feet
in
depth
these
circular
eddies
which
are
quite
independent
of
one
another
range
along
an
arc
of
about
two
miles
in
its
stretch
they
are
detached
like
giant
caldrons
yawning
unexpectedly
at
one
feet
in
which
the
flood
seethes
with
incredible
fury
every
one
of
these
has
opened
for
itself
a
narrow
orifice
in
the
rock
through
which
like
a
stone
from
a
sling
the
water
is
hurled
into
the
central
whirlpool
the
width
of
these
outlets
rarely
exceeds
fifteen
yards
but
their
depth
can
not
be
estimated
they
all
empty
themselves
into
one
immense
central
chamber
about
two
hundred
feet
wide
rushing
into
it
with
astounding
velocity
a
more
imposing
spectacle
can
scarcely
be
conceived
and
i
doubt
whether
abysses
such
as
these
exist
elsewhere
in
the
world
he
places
the
falls
in
latitude
but
corrects
the
longitude
given
by
azara
as
west
of
paris
to
that
is
west
from
greenwich
which
certainly
has
some
importance
in
fixing
the
breadth
of
the
territory
of
paraguay
but
neither
azara
nor
the
french
traveller
with
their
yards
and
feet
their
longitude
and
latitude
and
the
rest
give
an
idea
of
the
grandeur
of
the
place
buried
in
the
primeval
forests
forgotten
by
the
world
known
to
the
wandering
indians
who
give
no
quarter
any
more
than
in
azara
time
the
giant
cataract
is
a
lost
wonder
of
the
world
in
the
ruined
missions
on
the
parana
two
hundred
miles
away
i
have
heard
the
indians
talk
of
it
with
awe
they
told
how
through
the
woods
tangled
with
undergrowth
matted
together
with
lianas
they
had
hewed
a
path
monkeys
and
parrots
chattered
at
them
and
a
white
miasmatic
vapour
hung
over
trees
and
lakes
burying
the
clearings
in
its
wreaths
and
lifting
only
at
to
close
again
upon
the
woods
at
night
they
talked
of
alligators
jaguars
the
giant
and
the
mysterious
bird
known
to
them
as
the
which
in
its
tail
carries
a
burning
fire
in
the
recesses
of
the
thickets
demons
lurked
and
wild
caaguas
who
with
a
blowpipe
and
a
poisoned
arrow
slew
you
and
your
horse
themselves
unseen
pools
covered
with
victoria
regia
masses
of
red
and
yellow
flowers
upon
the
trees
the
trees
themselves
gigantic
and
the
moss
which
floated
from
their
branches
long
as
a
spear
the
voyage
in
canoes
whirled
like
a
cork
upon
the
rapids
lastly
the
falls
themselves
and
how
they
awestricken
at
the
sight
fell
prostrate
and
promised
many
candles
to
the
virgin
and
the
saints
on
their
return
they
talked
of
into
the
watches
of
the
night
somehow
i
like
those
countries
which
as
the
province
of
guayra
and
paraguay
appear
to
have
no
future
and
of
which
the
charm
is
in
the
past
it
pleases
me
to
think
that
the
sharp
business
men
of
times
gone
by
patting
their
stomachs
the
prison
of
their
brain
predicted
great
advancement
and
were
all
deceived
for
then
it
seems
as
if
the
prognostications
of
schemes
may
also
fail
and
countries
which
they
have
doomed
to
progress
still
remain
as
is
guayra
their
towns
deserted
with
but
the
broken
spire
of
some
old
church
emerging
from
the
verdure
of
the
tropics
as
the
paul
rocks
rise
sheer
out
of
the
sea
if
there
is
charm
in
the
unknown
there
is
at
least
as
great
a
charm
in
the
forgotten
and
the
salto
de
guayra
is
one
of
the
most
forgotten
corners
of
the
earth
to
this
wild
place
father
mendoza
proposed
to
lead
the
indians
from
the
reductions
of
san
jose
and
san
francisco
xavier
and
then
unite
with
them
any
of
the
fugitives
he
could
assemble
from
those
reductions
which
had
been
destroyed
but
even
the
doglike
patience
of
the
indians
was
at
an
end
and
they
preferred
to
die
or
be
led
captives
rather
than
run
the
chances
of
escape
in
such
a
solitary
place
in
their
despair
and
placed
between
the
paulistas
and
the
fear
of
emigration
the
neophytes
turned
as
even
more
civilized
people
than
themselves
will
turn
on
their
best
friends
and
held
the
jesuits
responsible
for
all
their
woes
two
indian
women
wives
of
having
been
taken
by
the
paulistas
the
indians
broke
into
the
church
where
a
jesuit
padre
salazar
was
officiating
and
interrupted
him
during
the
mass
with
the
most
bitter
insults
one
of
the
indians
menaced
him
with
a
lance
another
with
an
arrow
whilst
a
third
tried
to
snatch
the
chalice
from
his
hands
he
escaped
and
ran
holding
the
chalice
out
into
the
woods
followed
by
two
little
indian
boys
wandering
about
he
fell
in
with
the
other
jesuits
all
like
himself
outcasts
without
a
church
and
almost
deserted
by
the
indians
padre
ruiz
montoya
alone
possessed
a
shadow
of
authority
and
he
advised
the
outcasts
with
the
remnant
of
their
flocks
to
retire
into
the
woods
and
sow
a
crop
of
maize
for
food
whilst
he
endeavoured
to
get
help
from
paraguay
hardly
was
this
done
when
news
was
brought
him
which
made
him
alter
all
his
plans
two
messengers
came
to
inform
him
that
an
army
of
paulistas
was
marching
on
villa
rica
and
that
a
strong
detachment
of
them
was
advancing
from
the
south
then
padre
montoya
took
a
supreme
resolve
and
ordered
the
evacuation
of
the
two
principal
reductions
san
ignacio
and
loreto
which
yet
remained
intact
they
were
the
first
which
had
been
founded
in
guayra
and
were
as
important
as
any
of
the
spanish
towns
in
paraguay
the
churches
all
the
jesuit
writers
as
montoya
charlevoix
mastrilli
and
lozano
are
agreed
were
finer
than
any
in
the
land
the
indians
were
according
to
montoya
far
better
christians
than
the
inhabitants
of
the
spanish
settlements
and
their
faith
and
innocence
were
above
all
praise
they
cultivated
cotton
and
had
large
herds
of
cattle
so
that
the
most
bitter
enemies
of
the
jesuits
must
allow
that
much
had
been
accomplished
in
the
short
space
of
years
in
the
jesuits
came
to
guayra
and
found
it
absolutely
untouched
and
when
in
they
left
it
it
was
upon
the
road
to
become
one
of
the
most
flourishing
american
provinces
of
the
spanish
throne
the
other
missionaries
imagined
that
nothing
would
persuade
the
indians
to
depart
from
their
homes
where
for
so
many
years
they
had
been
happy
but
after
montoya
explained
to
them
his
plans
they
all
assented
to
them
as
with
a
single
voice
the
plan
by
means
of
which
the

of

during

and
thousands
had
dispersed
into

still
assembled
on

was
a
multitude
of
indians
of
every
sex
and
age
fortunately
or
unfortunately
no
record
by
an
exists
except
that
written
by
montoya
and
he
is
modest
to
a
fault
about
all
details
and
absolutely
silent
as
to
the
part
he
played
himself
he
tells
us
that
at
the
were
gathered
two
thousand
five
hundred
families
and
this
in
spite
of
the
dispersions
and
the
efforts
made
by

spanish
settlers
in
the
town
of
ciudad
real
who
feared
with
cause
to
be
exposed
to
the
full
fury
of
the
paulistas
without
allies
it
appears
the
indians
were
in
a
state
of
spiritual
exaltation
for
some
young
men
having
remarked
the
jesuits
were
packing
up
a
christ
and
an
image
of
the
blessed
virgin
which
in
happier
times
had
been
miraculous
they
declared
that
to
affront
exile
and
even
death
in
such
good
company
was
a
foretaste
of
heaven

indians

shift
the
burden
of
the
praise
on
to
the
shoulders
of
the
provincial

truxillo
but
with
indifferent
success
this
matter
of
bearing
your
own
praise
will
require
regulation
in
the
future
when
an
advance
of
civilization
has
opened
people
eyes
to
the
perception
that
praise
is
just
as
disagreeable
to
the
sufferer
as
is

gave
the
alarm
montoya
sent
at
once
to
ciudad
real
for
help
but
the
spanish
settlers
were
too
hard
pressed
themselves
to
give
assistance
nothing
remained
but
to
make
a
portage
of
all
their
rafts
boats
and
canoes
and
then
to
and
sail
down
the
parana
out
of
the
reach
of
the
paulistas
montoya
passed
in
review
his
boats
and
found
he
had
seven
hundred
and
that
twelve
thousand
people
had
embarked
with
him
on
leaving
the
paranapane
when
the
paulistas
found
the
jesuits
had
evacuated
all
their
towns
they
burnt
the
churches
on
the
principle
perhaps
that
the
nests
once
pulled
down
the
rooks
would
not
return
they
turned
the
jesuit
cells
into
barracks
for
themselves
taking
as
montoya
says
with
horror
into
those
chaste
abodes
where
never
woman
had
passed
through
the
doors
the
paulistas
then
entered
into
a
rigorous
of
the
private
lives
hoping
to
find
some
scandal
to
bring
against
them
especially
they
questioned
the
indian
women
giving
them
presents
to
discover
everything
they
knew
all
was
in
vain
the
discipline
of
the
order
or
the
strict
conscientiousness
of
the
individual
members
of
it
not
having
given
scandal
any
hold
the
most
difficult
part
of
the
great
exodus
was
now
to
come
the
rapids
and
the
cataracts
of
the
parana
extend
to
nearly
ninety
miles
and
the
whole
country
is
a
maze
of
tangled
forest
interspersed
with
rocks
no
paths
exist
the
place
is
desert
and
over
the
dank
mass
of
vegetation
the
moisture
from
the
clouds
of
vapour
thrown
up
by
the
falling
water
descends
in
rain
in
order
to
endeavour
to
save
the
trouble
of
reconstructing
new
rafts
and
canoes
at
the
bottom
of
the
cataract
montoya
launched
three
hundred
empty
boats
sending
an
indian
in
advance
to
see
if
any
of
them
would
arrive
safely
at
the
bottom
of
the
falls
not
one
escaped
and
so
the
pilgrimage
began
almost
without
provisions
and
without
arms
in
the
middle
of
a
country
quite
uncultivated
and
where
game
was
scarce
to
make
things
worse
intelligence
was
brought
that
a
few
miles
below
the
beginning
of
the
falls
the
spaniards
of
guayra
had
built
a
wooden
fort
surrounded
with
a
strong
stockade
hoping
to
intercept
the
retreating
indians
and
make
slaves
of
any
who
might
fall
into
their
hands
montoya
himself
dressed
as
an
indian
went
out
to
observe
the
enemy
and
on
his
return
the
whole
immense
assemblage
silently
plunged
into
the
woods
leaving
so
little
traces
of
its
passage
that
the
spaniards
in
the
fort
were
still
expecting
them
when
they
were
far
beyond
their
reach

opened
the
way
through

dense

jungle
of

bank
and
as
they
marched
along
montoya
says
they
sang
hymns
which
the
jesuits
had
taught
them
and
at
the
sound
of
them
fugitives
who
had
been
hiding
in
the
woods
came
out
and
joined
their

says

after

second
day
the
hymns
no
longer
sounded
through

woods
nor
did
they
play
upon
the
harps
and
other
instruments
whose
strings
being
all
broken
and

unglued
left
them
on
the
rocks
being
too
sad
to
look
at
them
all
through
the
weary
journey
montoya
seems
never
once
to
have
despaired
and
sets
down
in
his
book
the
adventures
of
each
separate
day
never
forgetting
to
chronicle
anything
strange
or
pathetic
as
it
occurred
to
him
on
the
fourth
day
he
sent
off
fathers
diego
nicolas
hennerio
and
mansilla
into
the
province
of
itatines
to
found
a
mission
there
acting
upon
orders
which
had
just
reached
him
from
the
provincial
of
the
order
shortly
before
he
had
started
from
guayra
they
took
with
them
images
and
everything
suitable
for
the
foundation
of
a
mission
but
the
first
two
were
martyred
by
the
wild
indians
and
the
third
just
fled
in
time
to
save
his
life
it
took
the
fugitive
indians
eight
weary
days
of
marching
to
reach
the
lower
end
of
the
cataract
where
once
again
the
parana
was
navigable
on
their
arrival
they
hoped
to
find
provisions
and
more
boats
but
none
were
there
their
own
stores
were
almost
done
and
the
people
too
exhausted
to
march
on
fever
broke
out
and
many
of
them
died
and
others
lost
in
the
forests
without
a
guide
wandered
about
till
death
released
them
from
their
march
a
weaker
man
than
padre
montoya
might
have
despaired
of
ever
issuing
from
the
woods
however
he
set
the
indians
to
work
to
make
canoes
and
to
cultivate
patches
of
maize
for
food
working
himself
alternately
with
axe
and
hoe
to
give
example
to
the
neophytes
others
again
cut
down
the
enormous
canes
which
in
that
region
grew
to
fifty
feet
in
height

make
them

fathers
suarez

were

in
this
memorable
retreat
it
is
difficult
to
give
the
palm
to
the
energy
and
courage
of
the
four
priests
or
to
the
resignation
and
faith
of
the
immense
multitude
of
indians
who
were
saved
by
them
so
after
a
considerable
time
all
was
in
readiness
for
a
new
start
and
luckily
provisions
from
the
reductions
on
the
parana
arrived
so
they
embarked
again
and
on
the
journey
a
raft
in
which
a
woman
and
two
children
were
sitting
upset
to
montoya
agony
as
he
knew
that
that
river
there
are
fish
that
the
people
call
culebras
which
have
been
seen
to
swallow
men
entire
and
throw
them
out
again
with
all
their
bones
broken
as
if
it
had
been
done
with
stones
he
says
confess
i
suffered
infinitely
and
turning
my
eyes
to
heaven
i
blamed
my
sins
as
having
been
the
cause
of
so
much
misery
and
said
o
lord
is
it
possible
that
for
this
thou
hast
brought
these
people
out
of
their
country
that
my
eyes
should
endure
the
spectacle
of
so
much
misery
and
my
heart
break
at
so
much
suffering
and
then
to
let
them
die
devoured
by
savage
fish
as
the
good
man
was
praying
the
indian
woman
head
appeared
above
the
water
and
montoya
himself
aided
by
indians
drew
her
and
the
children
in
safety
to
the
land
but
his
trials
were
not
at
an
end
for
many
of
the
hastily
constructed
rafts
and
canoes
sank
before
his
eyes
and
the
mortality
of
indians
was
great
eventually
they
found
a
temporary
refuge
in
the
reduction
of
the
nativity
upon
the
acaray
and
at
santa
maria
la
mayor
upon
the
iguazu
then
famine
raged
and
the
arrival
of
so
many
people
increased
the
scarcity
so
that
six
hundred
of
the
new
arrivals
died
in
one
reduction
and
five
hundred
in
the
next
at
last
the
scarcity
became
so
great
that
the
poor
indians
had
to
roam
about
the
forests
to
gather
fruit
and
many
of
them
died
in
the
recesses
of
the
woods
is
the
spanish

a
serpent
these
fish
may
have
been
waterboas
or
again
as
seems
probable
by
their
digestive
powers
some
kind
of
hypothetical
fish
not
yet
catalogued
seeing
no
hopes
of
saving
the
remainder
montoya
led
them
further
on
to
the
banks
of
a
little
river
called
the
jubaburrus
and
there
he
once
again
founded
two
reductions
which
he
named
loreto
and
san
ignacio
after
the
two
the
mamelucos
had
destroyed
he
bought
ten
thousand
head
of
cattle
out
of
the
money
the
king
allowed
to
the
jesuits
of
guayra
and
from
the
sale
of
some
few
objects
saved
from
the
general
destruction
of
the
towns
and
settled
down
his
indians
who
in
guayra
had
been
all
agriculturists
to
a
pastoral
life
thus
did
he
bring
successfully
nearly
twelve
thousand
people
a
distance
of
about
five
hundred
miles
through
desert
country
and
down
a
river
broken
in
all
its
course
by
rapids
landing
them
far
from
their
enemies
in
a
safe
haven
at
the
last
most
commonly
the
world
forgets
or
never
knows
its
greatest
men
while
its
fools
who
in
their
lives
perhaps
have
been
the
toys
of
fortune
sleep
in
their
honoured
graves
their
memory
living
in
the
page
of
history
preserved
like
grapes
in
aspic
by
writers
as
themselves
but
though
this
hegira
was
the
most
stirring
episode
of
montoya
life
he
yet
had
work
to
do
and
in
the
province
of
diplomacy
rendered
as
great
or
even
greater
services
to
the
indians
whom
he
loved
better
than
himself
as
in
the
memorable
journey
when
he
led
them
down
the
parana
the
name
of
this
river
seems
to
have
passed
through
the
machine
of
some
medieval
typewriter
for
it
is
like
no
name
in

so
much

to

perhaps
the

of

the

the

their
most
inveterate
enemies
the
marquis
de
valdelirios
in
his
curious
despatches
touches
much
upon
this
war
but
perhaps
the
best
account
is
to
be
found
in
the
curious
memoir
of
the
irish
jesuit
father
tadeo
hennis
who
was
the
backbone
of
the
resisting
guaranis
even
so
late
as
the

in
which
the
last

of

for
some
time
enjoyed
a
period
of
peace
and
of
repose
and
the
strange
policy
of
the
jesuits
was
developed
and
township
after
township
arose
amongst
the
guaranis
but
there
was
still
no
rest
for
ruiz
montoya
who
was
of
those
who
rest
but
in
the
grave
in
at
the
instance
of
the
governor
and
magistrates
of
the
township
of
jerez
montoya
sent
fathers
jean
ranconier
and
mansilla
to
the
north
of
paraguay
to
found
a
mission
amongst
the
itatines
a
tribe
their
territory
was
marshy
and
the
climate
bad
and
woods
of
covered
all
the
land
fathers
del

and
charlevoix
both
speak
of
the
balls
with
which
they
played
which
thrown
upon
the
ground
start
up
again
as
if
they
were
filled

this
is
perhaps
one
of
the
first
times
that
indiarubber

mentioned

in

places

to
indicate
he
was
acquainted
with

the
jesuits
found
that
to
make
progress
was
not
easy
with
these
indians
who
willingly
enough
listened
to
their
preaching
but
refused
to
alter
their
social
habits
to
which
the
jesuits
ascribe
the
fact
that
even
then
their
numbers
were
diminishing
like
most
of
the
indians
of
america
they
were
polygamists
which
custom
in
their
race
operates
differently
to
polygamy
amongst
the
negroes
for
whereas
they
seem
to
increase
and
thrive
the
indians
even
at
the
conquest
often
tended
to
become
extinct
when
a
headman
amongst
the
itatines
died
a
number
of
his
followers
jumped
down
precipices
to
accompany
him
upon
his
journey
to
a
better
world
this
custom
and
polygamy
gave
much
trouble
to
the
jesuits
but
their
most
admirable
patience
and
knowledge
of
mankind
helped
them
to
overcome
them
by
degrees
all
was
about
to
flourish
in
the
mission
when
one
acosta
a
brazilian
priest
appeared
perhaps
he
was
in
league
with
the
paulistas
or
perhaps
was
jealous
of
the
jesuits
for
he
tried
hard
to
lead
a
number
of
the
indians
to
san
paulo
to
show
them
as
he
said
how
they
should
follow
the
true
law
of
god
the
way
of
the
neophyte
even
is
hard
so
many
priests
of
different
jarring
sects
disputing
for
his
soul
as
hotly
as
if
it
were
a
preference
stock
which
they
had
private
intimation
was
just
about
to
rise
the
itatines
either
suspecting
that
acosta
true
law
was
false
or
tired
of
his
preaching
rose
and
killed
him
but
the
effect
was
bad
and
there
grew
up
amongst
those
infidels
a
coldness
even
towards
the
jesuits
themselves
had
it
not
been
for
two
miraculous
events
which
happened
opportunely
as
such
things
should
happen
if
they
are
to
be
turned
to
good
account
much
harm
might
have
been
done
a
chief
having
cursed
a
priest
was
seized
at
once
with
a
malignant
ulcer
in
the
throat
which
shortly
killed
him
the
itatines
did
not
apparently
think
anything
of
the
influence
of
the
unhealthy
climate
in
which
they
lived
and
set
the
occurrence
down
to
the
act
of
god
but
more
was
still
to
come
another
chief
having
so
far
forgotten
himself
as
to
jeer
at
a
priest
a
thunderbolt
fell
so
close
to
him
that
he
was
knocked
senseless
and
lay
as
dead
these
two
events
confirmed
the
jesuits
power
and
things
began
to
flourish
in
their
four
new
missions
but
the
great
power
so
careful
of
the
individual
effort
of
his
priests
seems
to
have
been
most
unaccountably
remiss
of
their
success
considered
as
a
whole
in
the
same
year
the
mamelucos
appeared
and
ruined
all
the
four
missions
so
that
the
efforts
of
the
jesuits
and
the
miracles
were
lost
in
the
first
skirmish
took
place
between
the
bishop
of
paraguay
and
the
jesuits
this
skirmish
little
by
little
grew
into
a
war
kept
up
for
more
than
a
hundred
years
and
ended
finally
in
the
expulsion
of
the
jesuits
from
paraguay
the
governor
don
luis
de
cespedes
having
called
upon
the
indians
of
the
jesuit
missions
for
personal
service
a
proceeding
quite
against
both
the
king
orders
and
the
papal
bulls
the
bishop
thought
the
moment
opportune
to
press
for
tithes
this
too
was
equally
forbidden
both
by
a
bull
and
by
an
order
of
the
council
of
the
indies
padre
romero
went
to
asuncion
and
displayed
his
bulls
and
his
orders
of
the
council
and
the
governor
withdrew
his
claims
the
bishop
after
some
opposition
withdrew
likewise
and
the
provincial
of
the
order
arrived
at
asuncion
bringing
with
him
an
order
from
the
king
signifying
that
the
indians
of
the
reductions
were
to
be
left
entirely
to
the
jesuits
so
for
the
present
the
jesuits
scored
a
victory
though
in
the
future
it
was
to
cost
them
dear
but
the
governor
of
paraguay
having
returned
apparently
to
his
design
of
exacting
personal
service
from
the
indians
of
the
missions
the
provincial
checkmated
him
with
a
royal
order
from
philip
iv
the
order
was
addressed
to
the
viceroy
of
peru
the
fourth
count
of
chinchon
the
missive
dated
at
madrid
in
condemned
in
the
strongest
terms
all
personal
service
that
is
forced
labour
amongst
the
indians
not
only
of
the
jesuit
missions
but
of
peru
and
mexico
with
a
touching
confidence
in
his
own
powers
and
absolute
right
divine
the
king
added
to
his
orders
a
paragraph
commanding
all
to
be
done
as
he
had
ordered
within
six
months
strange
to
find
philip
whom
velasquez
has
immortalized
and
shown
us
as
he
sat
upon
his
horse
ineffable
so
far
away
from
the
museo
del
prado
where
alone
he
ever
seems
really
to
have
lived
but
foolish
governors
and
bishops
were
not
the
jesuits
worst
enemies
in
paraguay
in
the
provincial
father
boroa
was
shipwrecked
in
a
voyage
up
the
uruguay
and
only
saved
by
the
devotion
of
his
neophytes
sometimes
the
cruel
treatment
of
the
natives
by
the
spanish
settlers
was
avenged
upon
the
jesuits
this
was
the
case
with
a
band
of
guapalaches
who
coming
on
father
espinosa
in
a
wood
attacked
and
massacred
him
and
all
his
indians
and
having
cut
his
body
into
pieces
left
it
for
the
wild
beasts
to
eat
upon
another
occasion
father
mendoza
fell
into
an
ambuscade
from
which
he
might
have
escaped
had
not
his
horse
sunk
in
a
miry
stream
long
he
defended
himself
with
an
indian
shield
but
at
length
was
stretched
upon
the
ground
and
left
for
dead
during
the
night
he
revived
and
dragged
himself
up
to
some
rocks
but
the
indians
in
the
morning
following
up
his
trail
came
on
him
praying
in
a
loud
voice
they
told
him
that
he
served
a
blind
god
or
at
best
a
powerless
god
as
he
did
nothing
to
defend
his
servant
then
after
torturing
him
cruelly
they
despatched
him
and
taking
out
his
heart
said
us
see
if
his
soul
will
take
the
road
to
heaven
these
savages
do
not
seem
to
have
been
genuinely
interested
in
finding
out
what
became
of
the
soul
after
the
dissolution
of
the
body
for
they
sat
down
and
made
a
hearty
meal
of
two
young
indians
who
accompanied
the
unlucky
priest
but
they
had
heard
their
victim
say
that
when
he
baptized
them
it
purified
their
souls
and
the
last
words
of
father
mendoza
had
been
to
recommend
his
soul
to
god
i
often
wonder
if
the
christians
of
their
creed
so
firmly
fixed
by
the
martyrdoms
of
simple
folk
who
held
their
faith
without
perhaps
much
reasoning
on
it
know
what
they
owe
to
men
like
father
christopher
mendoza
slain
by
the
indians
in
the
paraguayan
woods
your
ancient
martyr
fallen
out
of
fashion
and
forgotten
by
the
christians
of
should
have
his
homage
done
to
him
if
only
by
the
chance
writer
who
in
his
studies
for
some
subject
of
no
interest
to
the
general
world
comes
on
his
trail
of
blood
for
martyrdom
no
matter
how
obscure
forgotten
by
the
people
of
the
faith
for
which
the
martyr
suffered
is
a
slur
not
only
on
the
faithful
but
on
the
faith
itself
in
occurred
the
second
invasion
of
the
paulistas
which
induced
father
montoya
accompanied
by
father
diaz
tano
to
go
to
europe
to
seek
protection
for
the
indians
both
from
the
king
of
spain
and
from
the
pope
the
mamelucos
burst
into
the
province
of
tape
and
as
the
mission
of
one
of
the
few
left
undestroyed
at
the
former
invasion
was
most
exposed
father
romero
asked
permission
of
the
governor
of
the
river
to
make
some
trenches
to
defend
the
place
the
governor
consented
but
the
storm
burst
on
the
mission
before
the
defences
were
in
a
fit
state
to
defend
the
mission
priests
antonio
bernal
and
juan
cardenas
were
in
the
front
ranks
encouraging
the
indians
and
both
were
badly
wounded
fathers
mola
and
romero
went
about
ministering
to
the
wounded
but
escaped
themselves
at
last
the
mamelucos
having
set
fire
to
the
church
capitulation
became
inevitable
and
the
chief
part
of
the
indians
were
led
away
in
chains
the
same
fate
would
have
overtaken
the
mission
of
san
cristobal
where
father
romero
had
retreated
with
some
fugitives
from
had
not
the
people
and
their
priest
retreated
hastily
upon
the
mission
of
santa
ana
but
even
there
they
were
not
long
in
safety
and
had
to
undertake
another
perilous
journey
down
the
river
iguai
here
a
party
of
passing
mamelucos
fell
into
an
ambuscade
and
were
hewn
in
pieces
presumably
before
the
lord
the
mamelucos
pushed
their
advance
so
far
that
father
montoya
had
given
orders
that
all
the
missions
of
that
province
should
be
burned
the
inhabitants
who
trusted
him
quite
blindly
were
just
about
to
begin
to
burn
their
houses
when
an
order
from
the
provincial
stopped
them
from
doing
so
till
he
himself
appeared
upon
the
scene
he
arrived
and
gathering
up
the
scattered
indians
as
far
as
he
was
able
left
them
for
safety
in
some
of
the
missions
which
had
not
been
destroyed
and
set
off
himself
to
ask
for
help
from
the
governor
of
paraguay
this
province
was
sometimes
called
guayra
and
sometimes
la
provincia
de
vera
vera
being
the
family
name
of
alvar
nunez
cabeza
de
vaca
its
position
may
be
determined
by
reference
to
the
curious
volume
of
maps
published
at
madrid
by
don
francisco
javier
brabo
in
that
a
mission
could
be
so
undefended
as
to
need
trenches
that
a
jesuit
should
ask
leave
to
make
such
elementary
defences
even
in
the
face
of
imminent
danger
seems
to
prove
that
the
jesuits
at
least
in
had
no
intention
of
defying
the
sovereign
power
as
was
so
often
alleged
against
them
finding
no
help
either
from
him
or
from
the
governor
of
the
river
plate
he
went
to
corrientes
and
was
received
almost
with
contumely
then
desperate
he
equipped
an
army
of
the
mission
indians
and
advanced
to
fight
the
mamelucos
but
they
had
retreated
into
brazil
and
were
beyond
his
reach
seeing
that
nothing
was
to
be
hoped
from
the
spanish
governors
he
sent
a
box
of
papers
in
a
ship
going
to
portugal
and
laid
his
case
before
the
council
of
the
indies
montoya
and
charlevoix
relate
that
the
box
was
thrown
into
the
sea
near
lisbon
by
some
enemy
of
the
jesuits
but
providentially
was
washed
up
by
the
tide
and
being
found
miraculously
was
taken
to
the
king
of
spain
whether
this
happened
as
it
is
written
who
shall
say
but
in
distress
when
have
good
men
before
the
time
of
the
encyclopaedists
been
without
a
miracle
to
sustain
their
cause
in
the
next
year
father
montoya
and
tano
started
upon
their
mission
to
europe
and
a
new
field
was
opened
to
montoya
in
which
to
show
his
talents
on
the
indians
behalf
whilst
father
montoya
was
in
spain
the
provincial
appointed
father
alfaro
to
take
his
place
he
fell
on
troublous
times
for
the
mamelucos
were
preparing
to
attack
the
three
remaining
missions
in
the
province
of
guayra
as
they
were
not
defensible
it
was
agreed
to
evacuate
them
and
to
retreat
into
the
provinces
upon
the
uruguay
when
they
were
just
about
to
start
from
santa
teresa
where
the
inhabitants
of
the
other
missions
had
been
collected
the
mamelucos
appeared
just
before
christmas
the
indians
were
driven
off
as
slaves
and
the
mamelucos
with
their
usual
sense
of
humour
attended
mass
as
penitents
on
christmas
day
with
candles
in
their
hands
and
listened
to
the
sermon
in
an
edifying
way
the
priest
reproached
them
for
their
cruelty
and
they
after
listening
devoutly
gave
him
the
liberty
of
two
choir
boys
and
quietly
left
the
church
san
joaquin
santa
teresa
santa
ana
at
length
the
jesuits
rendered
desperate
by
the
perils
to
which
the
mission
indians
were
exposed
armed
several
bands
of
indians
and
attacked
the
mamelucos
but
as
was
to
be
expected
the
indians
were
always
worsted
by
the
and
disciplined
paulista
bands
and
then
the
jesuits
took
the
supreme
resolve
to
evacuate
guayra
entirely
and
place
the
indians
in
safety
between
the
rivers
parana
and
uruguay
formed
into
three
great
companies
the
indians
started
on
their
second
exodus
although
the
difficulties
were
less
than
in
the
voyage
down
the
parana
still
to
march
several
thousand
indians
just
emerged
from
savagery
accompanied
by
their
women
and
children
and
charged
with
all
their
possessions
through
a
wild
country
where
they
were
exposed
to
the
attack
of
a
enemy
upon
the
way
was
not
an
easy
task
father
christobal
arenas
formed
them
into
three
divisions
leading
the
first
himself
but
the
provincial
seems
to
have
done
most
of
the
organizing
for
charlevoix
says
that
his
courage
prudence
and
inalterable
kindness
the
success
was
due
du

liv
courage
and
prudence
and
inalterable
kindness
are
the
three
virtues
which
have
most
moved
the
world
perhaps
the
last
has
been
most
efficacious
and
one
would
hope
that
in
the
future
it
would
be
the
only
one
of
the
whole
three
required
twelve
thousand
indians
not
counting
women
and
children
were
thus
led
into
a
between
the
rivers
uruguay
and
parana
rich
fertile
and
as
the
distance
between
the
rivers
is
not
above
some
miles
defended
in
some
measure
and
easily
rendered
almost
impregnable
this
territory
is
now
the
argentine
province
of
misiones
no
one
can
see
the
heart
of
man
and
even
if
god
sees
it
he
never
tells
us
what
is
there
so
that
we
are
obliged
to
judge
of
actions
as
we
find
them
and
leave
the
search
for
motives
to
omniscients
on
the
face
of
it
the
jesuits
both
those
who
led
the
indians
down
the
parana
and
those
who
headed
them
in
this
migration
to
the
mesopotamia
between
the
uruguay
and
parana
were
not
impelled
by
thought
of
gain
and
if
a
jesuit
must
of
necessity
have
some
dark
scheme
behind
the
smallest
action
of
his
life
these
men
concealed
it
so
deep
down
within
their
souls
that
all
the
researches
of
their
keenest
enemies
have
not
been
able
to
throw
light
on
it
but
even
settled
in
their
new
homes
the
indians
were
defenceless
against
the
mamelucos
as
it
was
a
state
maxim
of
the
spanish
court
that
the
indians
should
never
be
allowed
the
use
of
guns
this
was
a
wise
enough
precaution
without
doubt
for
the
indians
of
the
encomiendas
who
lived
amongst
the
spaniards
and
owed
them
personal
services
but
arms
for
the
indians
of
the
missions
were
a
necessity
of
life
therefore
before
he
started
for
madrid
the
provincial
impressed
upon
montoya
to
approach
the
council
of
the
indies
and
the
king
and
represent
to
them
that
it
was
impossible
to
guarantee
the
existence
of
the
reductions
against
the
mamelucos
unless
the
indians
were
allowed
to
provide
themselves
with
arms
so
father
montoya
though
he
was
charged
to
press
for
various
reforms
was
most
especially
impressed
upon
this
point
he
was
to
tell
the
king
that
the
indians
were
not
to
be
allowed
to
keep
their
arms
themselves
but
that
they
would
be
kept
by
the
jesuits
and
served
out
to
the
indians
in
case
of
an
attack
then
that
the
arms
would
not
cost
a
penny
to
the
treasury
but
be
all
paid
out
of
the
alms
collected
for
the
purpose
by
the
company
lastly
and
this
was
a
true
stroke
of
jesuit
policy
that
to
instruct
the
indians
how
to
shoot
they
would
bring
from
chile
certain
jesuits
who
in
the
world
had
served
as
soldiers
one
sees
them
brought
from
the
frontiers
of
araucania
and
from
the
outposts
of
the
towns
half
sacristan
half
sergeant
instant
in
prayer
and
yet
with
a
look
about
them
like
a
serious
bull
terrier
a
fitting
kind
of
priest
for
a
frontier
town
and
such
as
could
alone
be
found
amongst
the
jesuits
about
this
time
the
third
invasion
of
the
mamelucos
took
place
and
father
alfaro
who
had
been
left
in
charge
of
the
missions
on
the
uruguay
and
parana
was
shot
by
a
mameluco
with
a
crossbow
and
fell
dead
from
his
horse
the
governor
of
paraguay
on
hearing
of
it
marched
with
an
army
and
having
killed
two
or
three
hundred
of
the
mamelucos
took
the
rest
prisoners
and
carried
them
back
to
asuncion
there
to
the
disgust
of
all
the
jesuit
historians
he
menaced
them
with
the
wrath
of
heaven
and
let
them
go
the
feelings
of
a
churchman
when
his
own
privilege
is
thus
usurped
may
be
compared
to
those
of
a
strict
who
sees
his
coverts
poached
it
is
not
so
much
the
damage
that
is
done
as
the
personal
insult
and
the
humiliation
which
he
suffers
in
his
pride
in
this
year
too
the
indians
of
the
missions
rendered
their
first
armed
service
to
the
state
which
afterwards
so
often
drew
on
them
in
its
necessity
and
treated
them
so
ill
the
governor
of
buenos
ayres
don
pedro
estevan
davila
was
setting
out
upon
an
expedition
against
a
tribe
of
indians
who
had
taken
refuge
in
the
islands
of
the
lake
ybera
eighty
of
the
indians
were
sent
and
being
well
led
and
armed
contributed
considerably
towards
success
next
year
a
second
contingent
was
required
by
the
governor
of
tucuman
and
duly
sent
to
his
assistance
history
seems
to
repeat
itself
and
foolish
soldiers
and
others
never
to
gain
experience
for
the
governor
padre
del
techo
in
his
paraquaiae
tells
us
having
made
war
in
flanders
could
never
be
dissuaded
that
the
same
system
was
not
suitable
for
warfare
in
america
accordingly
he
set
out
in
good
order
but
neglected
to
send
out
scouts
and
consequently
fell
into
the
middle
of
the
calchaquis
strongly
entrenched
within
a
marsh
attacked
them
with
a
rush
lost
heavily
and
had
to
retire
to
tucuman
but
all
this
time
father
montoya
and
diaz
tano
were
striving
in
rome
and
at
madrid
with
the
pope
and
with
the
king
urban
at
that
time
god
vicegerent
for
the
christian
portion
of
the
world
received
diaz
tano
kindly
listened
to
all
he
had
to
say
with
interest
promised
him
his
help
and
gave
him
a
papal
letter
menacing
the
mamelucos
with
the
wrath
of
god
from
rome
father
tano
went
to
madrid
and
thence
to
lisbon
whence
he
sailed
armed
with
the
protection
of
the
pope
and
accompanied
by
a
fresh
band
of
zealous
priests
arrived
in
rio
de
janeiro
he
published
the
papal
letter
and
fixed
it
on
the
doors
of
the
jesuit
college
and
on
those
of
their
church
he
seems
on
this
occasion
to
have
been
wanting
in
the
chief
jesuit
virtue
prudence
or
at
the
least
he
seems
to
have
mistaken
the
character
of
the
people
amongst
whom
he
was
most
of
the
colonists
having
relations
with
the
mamelucos
were
indignant
and
a
mob
broke
in
the
doors
both
of
the
college
and
of
the
church
the
riot
grew
so
serious
that
the
governor
convoked
a
council
and
cited
father
tano
to
appear
he
came
and
spoke
and
in
the
eyes
of
the
chief
people
of
the
place
made
out
his
case
but
the
multitude
caring
not
much
for
reason
and
nothing
for
philanthropy
became
more
furious
but
was
appeased
at
last
by
a
petition
being
sent
in
protest
to
the
pope
but
if
these
things
passed
in
rio
de
janeiro
which
del
techo
refers
to
as
sanctorum
what
was
the
fury
of
the
people
in
san
paulo
the
very
centre
of
the
mamelucos
when
the
published
the
brief
by
order
of
don
pedro
albornoz
the
people
rose
immediately
and
menaced
the
with
instant
death
unless
he
instantly
withdrew
the
brief
this
he
refused
to
do
although
forced
on
his
knees
and
with
a
naked
sword
held
at
his
throat
his
courage
quieted
them
and
they
drew
up
an
appeal
which
they
tried
hard
to
make
him
sign
but
he
again
refused
the
mob
having
demanded
the
brief
was
told
it
was
in
the
college
of
the
jesuits
thither
they
went
and
were
met
upon
the
steps
by
the
superior
dressed
in
canonicals
and
holding
the
holy
wafer
in
his
hand
he
spoke
and
most
of
them
fell
prostrate
on
the
ground
before
the
body
of
our
lord
others
stood
upright
and
said
that
whilst
they
adored
the
holy
sacrament
with
their
whole
souls
they
would
not
suffer
that
their
slaves
who
were
their
chiefest
property
should
be
set
free
an
atheist
or
some
kind
of
protestant
cried
out
to
fire
upon
the
priest
but
he
had
no
support
the
superior
then
gave
them
a
copy
of
the
brief
and
they
returned
to
the
to
ask
for
absolution
for
any
censure
of
the
church
they
might
have
incurred
but
he
for
the
third
time
was
obdurate
and
let
them
welter
in
their
sin
the
news
of
the
revolution
which
liberated
portugal
from
spain
having
just
reached
the
town
the
jesuits
had
to
retreat
from
it
leaving
the
inhabitants
enraged
against
them
and
more
determined
than
before
to
push
their
forays
into
paraguay
but
the
time
was
past
for
their
incursions
for
father
ruiz
montoya
had
prospered
at
madrid
and
secured
even
more
than
he
had
hoped
for
when
he
started
on
his
quest
on
arriving
at
madrid
which
he
did
after
a
prosperous
journey
of
four
months
he
waited
on
the
king
philip
iv
and
laid
before
him
and
commissaries
chosen
from
the
indies
and
castile
the
following
points
that
the
law
of
which
provided
that
no
indians
unless
taken
in
a
just
war
should
be
reduced
to
slavery
should
be
put
into
effect
that
the
pope
should
be
approached
to
confirm
the
briefs
of
paul
iii
and
clement
which
contained
the
same
provisions
that
those
who
did
not
conform
to
these
instructions
should
be
handed
over
to
the
inquisition
to
be
judged
that
the
indians
who
had
been
enslaved
by
the
paulistas
should
be
at
once
set
free
and
the
aggressors
punished
the
king
after
deliberation
granted
every
point
and
further
regulated
the
tribute
which
the
indians
were
to
pay
all
this
was
easy
to
enact
but
like
most
other
laws
not
quite
so
easy
to
put
into
effect
moreover
as
the
revolution
which
separated
portugal
from
spain
had
just
occurred
all
spanish
thunder
against
the
mamelucos
was
of
but
small
account
montoya
then
pressed
the
demand
for
license
to
use
firearms
in
against
the
mamelucos
the
king
after
deliberation
granted
this
last
point
and
from
that
time
the
incursions
of
the
mamelucos
ceased
in
paraguay
and
generally
throughout
the
mission
territory
then
also
there
was
set
on
foot
that
jesuit
militia
which
rendered
such
good
service
to
the
crown
but
was
the
cause
of
so
much
murmuring
as
it
protected
the
mission
indians
both
from
the
paulistas
and
from
the
inroads
of
the
spanish
colonists
this
seems
to
prove
the
malice
of
those
who
set
about
that
the
indians
of
the
missions
paid
no
taxes
to
the
crown
father
montoya
never
returned
to
paraguay
where
he
had
fought
so
long
and
done
so
much
for
the
poor
indians
apparently
it
was
not
written
that
he
should
see
the
results
of
all
his
efforts
for
having
embarked
at
seville
for
peru
he
was
detained
at
lima
on
business
of
the
order
from
thence
he
went
to
tucuman
and
having
returned
to
lima
died
aged
seventy
the
viceroy
and
the
chief
members
of
the
audiencia
with
whom
he
had
struggled
all
his
life
accompanied
his
body
to
the
grave
and
it
is
said
that
several
miracles
showed
forth
the
glory
he
enjoyed
in
heaven
that
may
be
so
and
if
they
happened
as
they
well
may
have
done
for
after
all
a
really
exists
for
those
who
credit
it
if
heaven
has
honoured
him
is
more
than
man
has
done
for
even
in
paraguay
his
name
is
not
remembered
though
it
remains
enshrined
in
the
neglected
pages
of
many
a
dusty
latin
or
a
spanish
book
vieyra
the
great
portuguese
jesuit
said
that
all
miracles
were
possible
to
god
but
yet
that
he
had
never
heard
that
our
lord
had
ever
cured
anyone
of
folly
but
all
the
time
that
fathers
montoya
and
diaz
tano
were
in
europe
a
serious
danger
to
the
jesuits
was
growing
up
at
the
discovery
of
the
new
world
the
franciscans
had
been
the
first
of
all
the
orders
to
go
out
some
had
accompanied
columbus
some
were
with
cortes
in
mexico
almagro
and
pizarro
hosts
had
their
franciscan
chaplains
in
his
commentaries
alvar
nunez
relates
how
he
met
some
of
the
order
in
brazil
lastly
the
first
of
all
the
saints
of
the
new
world
was
a
franciscan
in
the
franciscans
in
the
province
of
disputed
with
the
jesuits
the
right
to
certain
missions
accusing
them
as
padre
del
techo
says
putting
their
sickle
into
their
ripening
corn
what
could
be
more
annoying
if
it
were
true
as
if
a
wesleyan
mission
in
the
paumotus
group
should
after
having
shed
its
bibles
and
its
blankets
like
dry
leaves
suddenly
find
an
emissary
from
babylon
itself
arrive
and
mark
the
sheep
now
a
province
of
the
argentine
republic
paraquariae
book
cap
xii
but
from
jujuy
the
dissensions
spread
to
paraguay
where
the
franciscans
had
several
missions
extending
from
yuti
to
cazapa
thus
being
almost
within
touch
of
the
jesuit
gospellers
in
santa
maria
upon
the
eastern
bank
of
the
tebicuari
which
bounds
their
territory
these
jealousies
might
have
gone
smouldering
on
and
never
burst
out
into
fire
had
not
the
appointment
of
a
franciscan
to
the
see
of
paraguay
caused
the
flames
to
flare
out
fiercely
had
a
firebrand
been
wanted
to
stir
up
strife
none
better
could
have
been
found
than
don
bernardino
de
cardenas
who
was
just
then
appointed
to
the
bishopric
of
paraguay
chapter
iv
don
bernardino
de
cardenas
bishop
of
paraguay
his
labours
as
apostolic
missionary
his
ambitions
and
cunning
pretensions
to
saintliness
his
attempts
to
acquire
supreme
power
quarrels
between
cardenas
and
don
gregorio
the
temporal
governor
don
bernardino
de
cardenas
first
saw
the
light
in
the
town
of
la
plata
capital
of
the
province
of
charcas
in
bolivia
or
as
it
was
then
called
alta
peru
the
date
of
his
birth
is
uncertain
but
it
would
appear
to
have
been
in
the
early
years
of
the
seventeenth
century
at
an
early
age
he
entered
the
franciscan
order
la
plata
was
sometimes
called
chuquisaca
and
is
known
as
sucre
as
the
franciscans
had
had
the
honour
of
having
furnished
to
the
calendar
the
first
saint
canonized
in
the
new
world
it
seems
to
have
been
the
dream
of
cardenas
from
his
earliest
youth
to
emulate
him
in
this
desire
he
seems
to
have
acted
in
good
faith
and
all
his
life
the
dream
of
saintship
haunted
him
says
made
a
rather
superficial
study
of
theology
and
then
engaged
in
preaching
in
which
with
memory
assurance
and
facility
he
found
it
easy
to
succeed
in
a
country
where
brilliant
gifts
are
more
esteemed
than
solid
learning
certainly
a
preacher
without
assurance
memory
and
facility
would
scarcely
have
succeeded
in
any
country
and
in
what
country
in
the
world
is
brilliancy
not
far
esteemed
above
the
deepest
scholarship
besides
was
a
man
of
visions
visions
and
revelations
which
he
took
good
care
to
publish
visions
are
generally
in
the
case
of
saints
confined
to
the
soul
eye
and
revelation
to
the
inward
ear
if
therefore
the
recipient
of
them
does
not
make
them
known
they
run
the
risk
of
being
lost
in
a
word
according
to
charlevoix
he
was
of
the
most
complete
and
dangerous
ecstatics
that
ever
lived
first
successes
whether
as
preacher
or
ecstatic
are
not
specified
caused
his
superiors
to
name
him
guardian
of
their
college
of
la
plata
they
soon
repented
of
their
choice
no
sooner
was
he
named
superior
than
he
sought
to
qualify
himself
for
saintship
by
a
sort
of
royal
road
saints
are
of
several
classes
and
in
looking
through
the
calendars
it
strikes
one
how
different
seem
to
have
been
the
methods
by
which
they
severally
attained

this

he

profited
by

retreat
to
study
holy

and
to
such
good
effect
that
the
next

he
preached
he
charmed
his

by
his

soon
after
this
the

held
a
provincial
council
with
the
object
of
reforming
the
morals
of
the
indians
in

cardenas
being
a
fluent
speaker
was
chosen
for
the
post
of
apostolic
missionary
from
this
time
dates
the
beginning
of
his
fame
in
those
days
all
the
indians
of
the
charcas
and
generally
of
all
peru
were
sunk
in
misery
but
little
removed
from
slaves
and
their
religion
was
a
mixture
of
christianity
and
paganism
just
the
kind
of
folk
a
fluent
preacher
of
the
style
of
cardenas
could
work
upon
all
through
the
province
he
made
his
apostolic
progress
preaching
converting
and
confessing
everywhere
preceded
by
his
fame
as
seer
of
visions
and
recipient
of
celestial
light
he
took
his
way
dressed
like
a
pilgrim
on

carrying
a
wooden
cross
and
followed
by
a
multitude
of
indians
from
town

which
no
doubt
it
sprung
the
influence
of
the
vast
plains
and
forests
and
the
great
distances
to
travel
have
introduced
the
system
of
camp
meetings
amongst
the
protestants
whereas
the
catholics
have
often
held
a
sort
of
ambulatory
mission
the
people
of
one
village
following
the
preacher
to
the
next
and
so
on
in
the
same
fashion
as
in
palestine
the
people
seem
to
have
followed
john
the
baptist
soon
the
news
was
spread
about
that
the
indians
who
followed
cardenas
had
told
him
of
rich
mines
on
the
condition
that
he
would
not
divulge
the
secret
to
the
spaniards
at
that
time
the
search
for
mines
was
carried
almost
to
madness
in
peru
even
in
almost
every
mining
town
a
mysterious
man
sometimes
approaches
you
with
great
precaution
and
drawing
from
his
pocket
an
object
wrapped
in
greasy
paper
declares
with
oaths
that
it
is
red
silver
ore
and
that
he
knows
where
there
are
tons
and
tons
of
it
in
mexico
the
curious
class
of
miners
known
as
rove
through
the
valleys
of
the
sierra
madre
armed
with
pick
and
pan
passing
their
lives
in
hunting
mines
as
pigs
hunt
truffles
if
they
come
upon
a
mine
they
never
try
to
work
it
but
sell
the
secret
for
a
trifling
sum
and
drinking
out
the
money
start
on
again
to
find
the
mines
worked
by
the
aztecs
till
an
apache
bullet
or
arrow
stops
them
their
el
dorado
still
ahead
or
they
are
found
beside
their
pick
and
shovel
dead
of
thirst
neither
in
mexico
nor
in
peru
do
things
grow
less
in
telling
and
we
may
well
suppose
the
stories
of
the
mines
the
indians
told
to
cardenas
became
colossal
for
at
last
the
alcalde
of
cochabamba
wrote
on
the
subject
to
the
count
of
salvatierra
the
viceroy
of
peru
as
charlevoix
says
seemed
as
if
it
all
worked
to
the
advantage
of
the
holy
missionary
who
not
content
with
saving
souls
did
not
forget
the
interests
of
his
native
land
in
the
middle
of
his
triumphs
being
recalled
to
lima
no
one
doubted
that
it
was
in
order
to
confer
with
the
viceroy
about
the
supposititious
mines
others
again
imagined
that
a
mitre
was
destined
for
the
successful
evangelist
and
therefore
many
even
quite
poor
people
pressed
forward
to
offer
funds
to
help
him
on
his
way
with
quite
apostolic
assurance
he
took
all
that
was
offered
to
him
being
certain
as
some
think
that
the
mines
being
real
he
could
some
day
repay
with
usury
all
he
had
borrowed
or
as
others
said
being
indifferent
about
the
matter
and
trusting
to
repay
in
that
better
country
where
no
usury
exists
and
where
no
gold
corrupts
the
viceroy
being
a
man
of
little
faith
sent
to
investigate
the
supposititious
mines
but
found
them
the
superiors
of
cardenas
as
judicious
as
the
higher
officers
of
the
franciscan
order
often
proved
themselves
throughout
america
informed
him
that
he
had
given
offence
to
many
by
his
public
scourgings
and
processions
carrying
a
cross
and
most
of
all
that
in
his
sermons
propositions
had
escaped
him
of
a
nature
likely
to
bring
him
under
the
censure
of
the
holy
office
a
convent
in
lima
was
assigned
to
him
as
a
retreat
and
place
of
meditation
on
the
virtues
of
submission
and
obedience
as
we
may
well
believe
no
man
who
felt
he
had
the
stuff
within
himself
to
make
a
saint
ever
cared
much
for
obedience
or
submission
except
in
others
so
in
his
convent
instead
of
meditating
on
his
faults
he
passed
his
time
in
writing
a
memorial
to
the
council
of
the
indies
setting
forth
his
views
on
the
way
in
which
to
spread
the
gospel
amongst
the
indians
nothing
was
better
calculated
to
win
him
favour
every
indian
baptized
was
so
much
yearly
gain
to
the
spanish
government
conversion
and
taxation
always
went
and
therefore
indians
who
unbaptized
brought
nothing
to
the
treasury
having
received
the
gospel
truths
were
taxed
so
much
a
head
to
show
them
that
from
thenceforth
they
were
christians
thus
we
find
that
in
the
paraguayan
missions
each
indian
paid
a
dollar
every
year
as
a
sort
of
and
most
of
the
disputes
between
the
viceroys
of
paraguay
and
the
jesuits
arose
from
the
number
of
the
indians
taxable
the
viceroys
always
alleged
that
the
population
of
the
missions
never
increased
on
account
of
the
jesuits
returning
false
numbers
to
avoid
the
tax
cardenas
specially
inculcated
in
his
memorial
to
the
council
of
the
indies
that
it
was
not
expedient
to
place
the
indians
under
the
regular
clergy
a
theory
of
which
he
himself
was
destined
to
become
a
great
antagonist
promotion
as
we
know
cometh
neither
from
the
east
nor
from
the
west
so
it
fell
out
that
during
his
retreat
through
the
influence
of
his
friend
don
juan
de
solorzano
a
celebrated
lawyer
who
had
heard
him
preach
when
governor
of
guancavelico
he
found
himself
named
bishop
of
asuncion
del
paraguay
this
piece
of
luck
opened
the
doors
of
his
convent
to
him
and
he
repaired
at
once
to
potosi
to
wait
the
arrival
of
the
papal
bull
authorizing
him
to
take
possession
of
his
bishopric
there
he
appeared
in
the
habit
of
his
order
a
little
wooden
cross
upon
his
breast
and
a
green
hat
upon
his
head
a
costume
which
if
not
quite
fitting
to
his
new
dignity
was
at
least
suited
to
the
indian
taste
his
biographer
informs
us
that
without
a
word
to
anyone
he
began
to
preach
and
hear
confessions
being
absolutely
without
resources
he
was
reduced
to
distribute
indulgences
and
little
objects
of
piety
and
at
the
end
of
every
sermon
to
send
his
green
hat
round
the
audience
his
talent
for
preaching
stood
him
in
good
stead
and
after
every
sermon
gifts
were
showered
upon
him
and
a
crowd
accompanied
him
home
the
priest
of
potosi
being
just
dead
don
bernardino
took
his
place
without
permission
and
set
himself
up
in
the
double
character
of
parish
priest
and
bishop
to
hold
a
visitation
throughout
the
diocese
some
people
took
this
conduct
as
evidence
of
his
humility
in
condescending
though
a
bishop
to
officiate
as
a
mere
priest
the
archbishop
had
a
different
opinion
but
as
don
bernardino
had
a
great
following
he
thought
it
best
to
dissemble
his
resentment
cardenas
himself
by
his
imprudence
furnished
the
archbishop
with
an
excuse
to
get
him
out
of
the
bishopric
a
rich
indian
whom
cardenas
confessed
upon
his
left
him
ten
thousand
crowns
not
content
with
that
he
influenced
one
diego
vargas
to
change
his
will
and
leave
him
money
on
this
the
archbishop
wrote
to
him
requesting
that
he
would
go
and
govern
his
own
see
he
had
to
go
but
left
the
town
which
he
had
entered
without
a
farthing
with
a
long
train
of
mules
carrying
his
money
plate
and
furniture
why
he
did
not
instantly
go
to
asuncion
is
not
quite
clear
for
in
america
it
was
the
custom
owing
to
the
great
distance
from
rome
that
bishops
on
receipt
of
the
royal
order
of
appointment
got
themselves
chosen
by
the
chapter
of
their
diocese
to
govern
provisionally
instead
of
doing
that
he
went
to
tucuman
and
thence
to
salta
where
he
arrived
in
in
salta
his
first
visit
was
to
the
jesuit
college
where
he
laid
his
case
before
the
jesuit
fathers
and
showed
them
several
letters
one
from
the
cardinal
antonio
barberini
dated
in
and
another
from
the
king
without
a
date
naming
him
bishop
of
asuncion
on
the
strength
of
these
two
letters
he
asked
the
jesuits
if
he
could
get
himself
consecrated
without
the
papal
bulls
charlevoix
alleges
that
they
dared
not
refuse
to
answer
in
the
way
he
wished
why
this
was
so
is
not
so
easy
to
make
out
as
even
with
his
green
hat
and
wooden
cross
he
could
not
at
that
time
have
been
a
formidable
personage
their
written
opinion
he
sent
at
once
to
the
rector
of
the
jesuit
college
at
cordova
asking
for
his
opinion
and
that
of
the
doctors
of
the
university
the
answer
reached
him
in
santiago
del
estero
and
was
unfavourable
on
reading
the
letter
cardenas
fell
into
a
most
fury
and
tore
it
up
without
communicating
it
to
anyone
not
even
to
the
bishop
of
tucuman
don
melchior
maldonado
this
was
not
strange
as
he
had
counted
on
this
bishop
to
consecrate
him
notwithstanding
what
was
at
stake
he
went
on
in
the
diocese
of
tucuman
just
as
he
had
done
in
that
of
charcas
preaching
confessing
and
celebrating
mass
don
melchior
maldonado
a
quiet
man
of
no
pretensions
wrote
him
a
letter
in
which
he
said
came
into
my
diocese
like
a
bernard
such
is
the
reputation
you
have
for
holiness
and
preaching
that
my
people
pay
me
no
respect
and
only
look
on
me
as
a
man
of
common
virtue
and
mediocre
talents
although
i
hope
i
am
not
jealous
still
i
must
remind
you
that
you
act
as
if
you
were
st
paul
a
bishop
of
common
virtue
and
of
mediocre
talents
is
of
course
a
bishop
lost
and
one
can
well
conceive
that
poor
don
melchior
maldonado
was
placed
in
an
unpleasant
position
during
the
stay
of
cardenas
in
his
diocese
such
were
don
bernardino
powers
of
persuasion
that
at
last
the
bishop
consecrated
him
the
ceremony
was
hardly
over
when
a
letter
arrived
from
the
rector
of
the
university
of
cordova
advising
bishop
maldonado
against
the
consecration
unluckily
for
paraguay
it
was
too
late
to
undo
the
action
and
cardenas
was
now
in
a
position
to
take
possession
of
his
see
poor
melchior
maldonado
bishop
of
tucuman
had
as
it
happened
laid
hands
a
little
hastily
upon
the
candidate
the
council
of
trent
pronounced
upon
the
case
and
found
the
consecration
of
the
bishop
of
paraguay
had
been
a
valid
one
as
touching
the
sacrament
ordination
and
the
impression
of
the
character
but
that
it
had
been
void
as
regards
the
power
of
discharging
the
functions
attaching
to
the
dignity
and
that
the
bishop
and
his
consecrator
had
need
of
absolution
which
the
same
holy
congregation
thinks
ought
to
be
accorded
with
the
good
pleasure
of
the
pope
as
the
same
holy
congregation
had
previously
declared
the
taking
possession
of
the
diocese
by
cardenas
had
been
illegal
it
is
difficult
for
ordinary
minds
to
grasp
their
real
opinion
of
the
case
finding
that
he
had
failed
with
the
university
of
cordova
don
bernardino
took
his
way
to
santa
fe
from
whence
he
wrote
an
insulting
letter
to
the
poor
rector
the
letter
was
conceived
in
such
outrageous
terms
that
the
bishop
of
tucuman
wrote
in
expostulation
saying
he
expected
to
see
something
extraordinary
happen
in
paraguay
if
he
gave
way
to
such
excess
of
passion
don
bernardino
usual
luck
attended
him
in
santa
fe
this
town
then
formed
part
of
the
diocese
of
buenos
ayres
though
situated
about
four
hundred
miles
from
the
metropolis
it
happened
that
the
see
of
buenos
ayres
was
vacant
and
the
chapter
of
the
cathedral
invited
cardenas
to
visit
that
portion
of
the
diocese
through
which
he
had
to
pass
cardenas
was
of
course
delighted
to
show
his
talents
for
preaching
as
he
had
done
before
in
charcas
and
in
potosi
when
he
arrived
at
corrientes
the
enthusiasm
for
his
holiness
and
talents
was
extraordinary
in
corrientes
don
bernardino
seems
to
have
felt
for
the
first
time
his
calling
and
election
really
sure
at
the
time
he
landed
the
land
was
sunk
in
ignorance
and
superstition
even
in
corrientes
the
city
of
the
seven
currents
situated
just
at
the
junction
of
the
rivers
parana
and
paraguay
close
to
the
celebrated
missions
of
the
jesuits
the
inhabitants
living
in
a
country
almost
tropical
are
half
indians
in
type
what
corrientes
looked
like
in
don
bernardino
time
is
matter
of
conjecture
perhaps
it
was
not
greatly
different
from
some
remote
frontier
towns
some
years
ago
save
for
the
groups
of
spanish
soldiery
with
their
steel
morions
trunk
hose
and
heavy
arquebuses
lounging
about
and
in
the
matter
of
the
scarcity
of
horses
in
the
streets
no
doubt
the
listless
air
hung
over
everything
and
in
the
place
of
the
modern
blue
and
white
barred
flags
with
a
rising
sun
or
cap
of
liberty
stuck
like
a
in
the
corner
the
blood
and
orange
spanish
colours
with
the
quarterings
of
castles
and
of
lions
flapped
heavily
against
the
flagstaff
of
the
fort
the
indian
women
dressed
all
in
white
their
hair
cut
square
across
the
forehead
and
hanging
down
their
backs
sat
with
their
baskets
of
fruit
and
flowers
in
the
the
town
as
now
built
chiefly
of
adobes
with
a
few
wooden
huts
dotted
about
was
in
design
on
every
church
were
cupolas
after
the
eastern
fashion
flat
roofs
on
every
house
and
everything
shone
dazzling
white
against
the
dark
foliage
of
the
trees
the
streets
as
now
were
sandy
crossed
here
and
there
with
traverses
of
stone
to
break
the
force
of
the
water
in
the
season
of
the
rains
at
night
the
fireflies
glistened
amongst
the
heavy
leaves
of
the
mamayes
and
the
whilst
from
the
chaco
rose
the
mysterious
voices
of
the
desert
night
and
from
the
outskirts
of
the
town
the
wailing
indian
jarabis
and
cielitos
sung
in
a
high
falsetto
key
to
the
tinkling
of
a
cracked
guitar
but
broken
now
and
then
by
the
sharp
warning
cry
centinela
of
the
soldiers
on
the
walls
could
one
have
landed
there
one
would
have
felt
much
as
a
sailor
feels
dropped
on
the
beach
of
eromango
or
on
some
yet
unbemissionaried
island
of
the
paumotus
group
embarking
from
corrientes
up
the
river
paraguay
the
bishop
met
two
vessels
sent
from
asuncion
to
do
him
honour
when
night
approached
he
put
in
practice
one
of
the
manoeuvres
which
in
peru
had
stood
him
in
good
stead
on
every
side
a
swarm
of
launches
and
canoes
accompanied
the
ship
to
see
the
bishop
whom
already
many
believed
a
saint
he
asked
them
all
to
retire
a
little
from
his
ship
all
did
so
but
the
guard
of
honour
sent
from
asuncion
towards
the
middle
of
the
night
the
sound
of
scourging
wakened
them
it
was
their
bishop
trying
to
prepare
himself
for
the
duties
that
awaited
him
every
succeeding
night
the
same
thing
happened
during
the
day
he
celebrated
mass
pontifically
upon
the
deck
voyages
upon
the
river
paraguay
before
the
days
of
steamers
took
a
considerable
time
especially
as
every
night
the
custom
was
to
anchor
or
to
make
fast
the
vessel
to
a
tree
soon
the
rumour
reached
asuncion
that
a
second
thomas
was
on
his
way
to
visit
them
thomas
as
is
said
once
visited
paraguay
and
a
cave
in
the
vicinity
of
a
town
called
paraguari
where
he
once
lived
exists
to
prove
the
passage
of
the
saint
fate
seemed
determined
that
the
bishop
should
always
meet
the
jesuits
no
matter
where
he
went
becoming
weary
of
the
slow
progress
of
the
ships
he
disembarked
four
leagues
below
asuncion
at
a
farm
belonging
to
the
company
he
managed
to
dissemble
his
resentment
so
perfectly
that
no
one
knew
he
had
a
grudge
against
them
arrived
at
the
capital
he
went
at
once
to
the
church
of
san
blas
then
to
the
cathedral
where
he
celebrated
mass
and
preached
his
mitre
on
his
head
after
service
he
dismissed
the
people
to
their
homes
to
dine
saying
however
that
he
himself
was
nourished
by
an
invisible
food
and
by
a
beverage
which
men
could
not
perceive
food
he
said
but
to
do
the
work
and
will
of
him
who
sent
me
therefore
he
remained
in
prayer
and
meditation
until
vespers
and
that
office
finished
he
retired
to
the
palace
accompanied
by
a
shouting
crowd
in
his
position
his
conduct
was
most
adroit
for
as
his
bulls
had
not
arrived
he
must
have
known
he
had
no
legal
status
and
that
in
default
of
that
he
had
to
conquer
public
sympathy
the
chapter
never
doubted
that
don
bernardino
would
place
himself
entirely
in
their
hands
as
his
bulls
had
not
arrived
he
however
seems
to
have
thought
that
the
act
of
celebrating
mass
pontifically
in
the
cathedral
had
put
him
in
possession
of
his
powers
so
he
named
one
cristobal
sanchez
as
his
two
of
the
members
of
the
chapter
don
diego
ponce
de
leon
and
don
fernando
sanchez
remonstrated
but
a
considerable
portion
of
the
chapter
sided
with
cardenas
the
stronger
party
left
the
cathedral
and
celebrated
mass
in
the
church
belonging
to
the
jesuits
thus
giving
cardenas
a
second
cause
of
offence
against
the
company
the
bishop
not
being
secure
of
his
position
had
recourse
to
every
to
catch
the
public
eye
fasting
and
scourging
prayers
before
the
altar
two
masses
every
day
barefoot
processions
himself
the
central
figure
carrying
a
cross
each
had
their
turn
along
the
deep
red
roads
between
the
which
lead
from
asuncion
towards
the
recoleta
and
the
campo
grande
he
used
to
take
his
way
accompanied
by
indians
crowned
with
flowers
giving
his
benediction
as
he
passed
to
turn
away
according
to
himself
the
plague
and
to
insure
a
fertile
harvest
not
being
content
with
the
opportunities
which
life
afforded
he
instituted
an
evening
service
in
a
church
in
order
to
prepare
for
death
but
besides
putting
into
execution
all
his
histrionic
talents
he
had
the
adroitness
to
address
himself
to
those
feelings
of
which
he
knew
were
perhaps
more
powerful
than
those
of
admiration
and
respect
for
his
own
saintly
proceedings
in
his
new
diocese
cretineau
joly
in
his
de
la

les
vieux
levain
de

et

soon
as
was
to
be
expected
in
such
a
country
this
service
proved
the
occasion
of
much
scandal
and
instead
of
showing
people
how
to
leave
the
world
became
the
means
of
introducing
many
into
life
in
a
clandestine
way
the
rector
of
the
jesuit
college
thought
it
his
duty
to
inform
the
bishop
but
he
like
all
good
men
thought
nothing
bad
could
spring
from
anything
that
he
himself
originated
no
doubt
he
put
it
down
to
malice
as
good
people
will
when
worldlings
put
the
finger
on
the
weak
spot
of
a
religious
institution
but
anyhow
regardless
of
the
scandals
he
continued
his
nocturnal
rites
the
governor
of
paraguay
at
that
time
was
one
gregorio
de
hinostrosa
an
officer
born
in
chile
an
honest
pious
man
and
much
beloved
by
the
inhabitants
of
paraguay
on
his
arrival
don
bernardino
tried
to
conciliate
him
unluckily
a
friendship
with
the
bishop
was
impossible
without
a
blind
submission
to
his
will
in
the
beginning
all
was
flattery
when
don
gregorio
attended
mass
the
bishop
used
to
meet
him
at
the
church
door
not
to
be
outdone
the
governor
returned
the
bishop
politeness
in
a
similar
way
but
went
so
far
in
his
complaisance
that
don
bernardino
ceased
to
respect
him
soon
there
arose
bickerings
and
jealousies
and
at
length
they
hated
one
another
fervently
nor
was
the
bishop
more
successful
with
his
clergy
some
of
them
laughed
at
his
pretensions
to
be
a
saint
and
called
him
an
ambitious
schemer
again
amongst
the
laity
many
did
not
quite
understand
his
habit
of
celebrating
two
masses
every
day
he
answered
that
he
never
celebrated
without
releasing
a
soul
from
purgatory
and
that
there
had
been
saints
who
celebrated
nine
masses
every
day
and
moreover
that
he
was
pope
in
his
own
diocese
this
cut
the
ground
from
under
the
feet
of
his
detractors
for
in
a
town
of
the
calibre
of
asuncion
the
people
looked
on
a
service
in
a
church
as
a
welcome
means
of
getting
through
the
day
and
had
he
celebrated
a
dozen
masses
they
would
but
have
been
more
delighted
with
their
new
bishop
under
the
pretext
that
there
were
not
enough
priests
to
serve
the
churches
he
by
degrees
took
several
parishes
into
his
own
hands
and
went
from
church
to
church
to
celebrate
his
mass
in
each
whilst
not
forgetting
to
draw
the
various
stipends
for
his
work
but
not
content
with
this
he
began
to
ordain
young
men
who
knew
no
latin
and
even
criminals
setting
forth
the
view
that
ordination
was
a
sort
of
second
baptism
which
purged
all
crimes
a
most
convenient
theory
and
one
which
is
not
half
enough
insisted
on
in
these
degenerate
days
the
position
of
asuncion
gave
him
an
opportunity
of
an
almost
unique
kind
to
show
his
talents
in
another
sphere
across
the
river
paraguay
there
about
one
mile
broad
extends
the
country
called
the
chaco
a
vast
domain
of
swamp
and
forest
inhabited
in
those
days
as
at
present
by
tribes
of
wandering
indians
from
the
city
walls
whilst
listening
to
the
one
can
see
the
smoke
of
indian
encampments
across
the
river
only
a
mile
away
of
all
the
indian
tribes
in
the
time
of
cardenas
the
most
ferocious
were
the
guaycurus
the
jesuits
had
laboured
almost
in
vain
amongst
them
missions
had
been
founded
and
all
gone
well
for
months
and
even
years
when
on
a
sudden
and
without
reason
the
guaycurus
had
burned
the
houses
killed
the
priests
and
gone
back
to
the
wilds
from
santa
fe
up
to
the
province
of
matto
grosso
they
kept
the
frontier
in
a
turmoil
crossing
the
river
and
feeding
like
locusts
on
the
settlements
in
paraguay
not
long
before
his
arrival
the
guaycurus
had
intimated
their
intention
of
holding
a
conference
with
don
gregorio
hinostrosa
don
bernardino
thought
the
chance
too
good
to
lose
and
at
once
declared
that
as
a
bishop
it
was
his
place
to
carry
on
negotiations
with
the
barbarians
dressed
in
his
robes
and
with
an
escort
furnished
by
the
governor
he
met
the
chiefs
who
no
doubt
looked
on
him
as
a
new
kind
of
preached
to
them
through
an
interpreter
curiously
being
without
the
gift
of
tongues
but
notwithstanding
that
a
reasonable
number
of
them
were
baptized
on
his
return
he
wrote
to
the
king
that
by
his
efforts
he
had
appeased
the
most
ferocious
indians
within
his
majesty
domains
within
a
week
the
guaycurus
surprised
and
burned
a
settlement
a
little
higher
up
the
stream
not
content
with
this
caligulesque
apostolate
to
the
guaycurus
the
bishop
longed
for
serious
occupation
and
caused
it
to
be
rumoured
about
the
city
that
he
did
nothing
except
by
the
direct
authority
of
the
holy
ghost
an
allegation
hard
to
confute
and
if
allowed
likely
to
lead
to
difficulties
even
in
paraguay
some
years
before
the
advent
of
don
bernardino
the
dominicans
had
built
a
convent
in
asuncion
as
they
had
no
license
to
build
they
were
in
the
position
of
religious
squatters
on
the
domain
of
god
the
citizens
had
applied
to
the
audiencia
of
charcas
the
supreme
court
on
all
such
matters
in
south
america
situated
with
true
spanish
unpracticality
in
one
of
the
most
secluded
districts
of
the
continent
the
audiencia
had
refused
the
license
but
had
taken
the
matter
for
ten
years
to
take
a
matter
into
consideration
for
ten
years
even
in
spain
or
south
america
where
the
law
delay
is
generally
more
mortal
than
in
any
other
country
was
as
good
as
giving
a
permission
so
the
dominicans
construed
it
and
no
one
dreamed
of
now
molesting
them
one
day
the
bishop
dressed
in
his
robes
proceeded
from
his
palace
to
the
convent
informing
the
governor
that
he
wanted
him
to
meet
him
there
entering
the
convent
church
he
took
the
sacrament
from
off
the
altar
and
stripped
the
church
of
all
its
ornaments
setting
a
gang
of
workmen
to
demolish
both
the
convent
and
the
church
when
the
work
was
over
he
went
to
a
neighbouring
church
and
then
and
there
without
confession
celebrated
mass
remarking
to
the
faithful
that
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
make
confession
as
he
was
satisfied
of
the
condition
of
his
conscience
some
murmured
but
the
greater
portion
of
the
people
always
ready
to
take
a
saint
at
his
own
valuation
were
delighted
with
his
act
doubts
must
have
crossed
his
mind
as
shortly
afterwards
he
wrote
to
don
melchior
maldonado
bishop
of
tucuman
for
his
opinion
that
bishop
answered
rather
tartly
that
his
zeal
appeared
to
him
to
savour
more
of
the
zeal
of
elias
than
of
jesus
christ
and
that
in
a
country
where
churches
were
so
few
it
seemed
imprudent
to
pull
down
rather
than
to
build
he
added
light
is
not
so
brilliant
as
the
light
your
lordship
is
illumined
by
when
once
a
man
is
well
convinced
that
all
he
does
comes
from
the
holy
ghost
there
is
but
little
that
he
can
not
do
with
satisfaction
to
himself
according
to
the
custom
of
those
times
were
not
allowed
admission
into
holy
ground
as
if
the
fact
of
having
found
their
life
unbearable
debarred
them
from
the
right
to
be
considered
men
such
a
man
a
few
years
previously
had
been
buried
at
a
it
now
occurred
to
cardenas
to
have
a
special
revelation
on
the
subject
and
curiously
enough
this
special
revelation
was
on
the
side
of
body
said
the
bishop
that
of
a
christian
and
i
feel
pretty
sure
his
soul
is
now
in
bliss
he
gave
no
reason
for
his
opinion
as
is
the
way
of
most
religious
folk
but
as
he
had
special
means
of
communication
with
heaven
most
people
were
contented
incontinently
he
had
the
corpse
dug
up
and
buried
in
the
church
of
the
incarnation
himself
performing
all
the
funeral
rites
although
a
miracle
or
two
would
have
shocked
nobody
still
in
the
matter
of
the
suicide
he
had
gone
too
far
for
the
simple
people
of
the
place
they
murmured
and
for
a
moment
the
bishop
prestige
was
in
jeopardy
but
in
the
nick
of
time
his
bulls
arrived
brought
by
his
nephew
pedro
de
cardenas
who
like
himself
was
a
franciscan
friar
this
saved
him
and
gave
the
people
something
new
to
think
of
though
at
the
same
time
he
incurred
a
new
anxiety
in
the
bulls
there
was
a
passage
to
the
effect
that
if
at
his
consecration
any
irregularity
had
been
incurred
he
was
liable
to
suspension
from
all
his
functions
this
the
jesuit
who
translated
the
documents
into
spanish
for
the
purpose
of
publication
drew
his
attention
to
however
cardenas
was
not
a
man
to
be
intimidated
by
so
small
a
matter
but
read
the
translation
to
the
people
in
the
cathedral
and
intimated
to
them
that
the
pope
had
given
him
unlimited
power
in
paraguay
both
in
matters
spiritual
and
temporal
though
don
gregorio
the
governor
was
present
at
the
ceremony
he
made
no
protest
at
the
assumption
of
temporal
power
by
cardenas
he
had
remarked
it
though
and
secretly
determined
to
show
him
that
his
pretensions
were
unfounded
his
nephew
don
pedro
de
cardenas
furnished
the
occasion
this
young
man
had
been
despatched
to
spain
to
get
the
bulls
upon
the
voyage
he
seems
to
have
conducted
himself
with
scant
propriety
on
his
return
when
passing
corrientes
he
took
on
board
a
lady
whom
charlevoix
quite
in
the
spirit
of
the
author
of
the
book
of
proverbs
describes
as
jeune
femme
bien
faite
having
some
qualms
of
conscience
he
put
on
a
secular
dress
and
on
nearing
asuncion
put
his
religious
habit
over
it
in
such
a
climate
this
double
costume
must
have
been
inconvenient
and
why
he
should
have
worn
one
dress
above
the
other
does
not
appear
his
uncle
in
his
delight
at
the
forthcoming
of
the
bulls
most
probably
paid
little
attention
to
his
appearance
he
lodged
him
in
the
palace
and
assigned
him
a
prebendary
which
was
vacant
where
the
femme
bien
faite
was
lodged
is
not
set
down
and
the
people
of
asuncion
no
doubt
looked
leniently
on
such
affairs
as
does
society
in
england
after
his
usual
fashion
the
bishop
set
all
down
to
calumny
about
this
time
the
governor
had
put
in
prison
one
ambrosio
morales
a
of
the
inquisition
who
had
had
a
quarrel
with
an
officer
cardenas
being
informed
of
this
could
not
lose
so
good
a
chance
of
exercising
the
power
he
arrogated
in
temporal
affairs
holding
a
monstrance
in
his
hands
he
went
to
the
prison
and
asked
for
the
prisoner
placing
the
monstrance
on
a
table
at
the
prison
gate
the
rector
of
the
jesuit
college
came
and
expostulated
with
him
saying
that
it
was
not
fitting
to
expose
the
body
of
jesus
christ
in
such
a
place
and
that
it
was
not
decent
that
the
bishop
himself
should
stay
there
considering
his
position
and
the
times
in
which
he
lived
it
seems
the
rector
was
judicious
in
his
expostulation
cardenas
replied
that
he
would
stay
there
till
the
prisoner
was
released
the
rector
knowing
him
to
be
as
obstinate
as
a
male
mule
went
and
begged
the
governor
to
let
morales
out
this
he
did
at
once
and
then
the
bishop
cross
in
hand
returned
in
triumph
to
the
palace
with
the
rescued
inquisitor
following
amongst
his
train
the
people
whose
lives
were
dull
snatched
at
the
opportunity
for
some
amusement
and
said
that
it
was
good
luck
the
governor
and
bishop
were
not
always
of
one
mind
for
that
their
agreement
had
caused
the
demolition
of
a
church
and
convent
and
their
quarrel
the
setting
of
a
prisoner
free
this
little
triumph
emboldened
the
bishop
to
go
further
he
admitted
morales
into
minor
orders
gave
him
the
tonsure
and
thus
having
placed
him
above
the
temporal
power
enabled
him
to
brave
the
governor
openly
the
bishop
nephew
taking
the
governor
kindness
for
weakness
broke
publicly
into
insulting
terms
about
him
the
governor
brother
father
hinostrosa
pressed
him
to
vindicate
his
dignity
but
he
refused
saying
he
wanted
peace
at
any
price
this
policy
the
bishop
did
not
understand
for
all
concessions
he
set
down
as
weakness
and
they
encouraged
him
to
fresh
exactions
and
more
violence
dining
with
the
governor
the
bishop
chanced
to
see
upon
the
table
a
fine
pair
of
silver
candlesticks
to
see
and
to
desire
with
cardenas
was
to
ask
and
so
he
intimated
to
the
governor
his
wish
to
have
them
the
governor
thinking
perhaps
to
wipe
out
the
remembrance
of
the
difficulty
about
morales
sent
them
to
the
palace
with
his
compliments
the
bishop
took
the
present
and
turning
to
the
man
who
brought
them
said
should
now
be
quite
content
if
i
only
had
the
silver
ewer
and
flagon
which
i
noticed
in
your
master
house
the
governor
we
may
suppose
on
hearing
this
made
what
the
spaniards
call
risa
del
conejo
but
sent
the
plate
and
a
message
saying
all
his
house
contained
was
at
the
bishop
service
don
bernardino
who
though
he
may
have
been
a
saint
as
his
friends
proclaimed
was
certainly
far
from
a
gentleman
sent
for
the
flagon
and
the
ewer
which
he
received
at
once
together
with
a
friendly
message
from
the
governor
but
even
this
offering
brought
no
quiet
for
a
new
quarrel
soon
arose
between
the
bishop
and
the
unlucky
wielder
of
the
temporal
power
the
society
of
the
holy
sacrament
enjoyed
an
at
or
near
asuncion
the
bishop
no
doubt
thinking
he
was
most
fitted
to
indoctrinate
the
indians
endeavoured
to
persuade
the
governor
to
get
the
society
of
the
holy
sacrament
to
make
their
indians
over
to
himself
the
governor
who
knew
his
flatly
refused
and
upon
this
don
bernardino
fell
into
a
fury
and
reproached
him
with
such
bitterness
that
don
gregorio
too
overstepped
the
bounds
of
prudence
and
threw
the
conduct
of
his
nephew
with
the
femme
bien
into
the
bishop
teeth
hell
has
been
said
to
have
no
fury
equal
to
a
woman
scorned
but
a
bishop
thwarted
makes
a
very
tolerable
show
don
bernardino
was
one
of
those
who
think
an
insult
to
themselves
carries
with
it
a
challenge
to
god
an
outrage
on
religion
and
generally
conceive
the
honour
of
heaven
is
attacked
by
any
contradiction
of
themselves
to
animadvert
upon
the
actions
of
a
bishop
nephew
is
as
bad
as
heresy
far
worse
than
simony
and
the
man
who
does
it
can
not
but
be
a
heretic
at
heart
so
at
least
don
bernardino
thought
for
with
candle
bell
and
book
and
what
was
requisite
he
excommunicated
the
poor
governor
and
declared
him
incompetent
to
bear
the
royal
standard
in
a
religious
festival
which
was
shortly
to
take
place
excommunication
was
at
least
as
serious
then
as
bankruptcy
is
now
though
in
spanish
america
it
did
not
carry
with
it
such
direful
consequences
as
in
european
states
not
wishing
to
use
force
the
governor
yielded
the
point
and
did
not
trouble
the
procession
his
moderate
conduct
gained
him
many
partisans
and
put
many
people
against
the
cardenas
the
nephew
pedro
de
cardenas
thought
it
a
good
occasion
to
insult
the
governor
in
public
so
one
day
in
the
street
he
followed
him
casting
reflections
on
his
mother
and
his
female
relatives
don
gregorio
who
was
a
man
of
tried
courage
having
served
for
years
against
the
indians
of
arauco
the
bravest
race
of
all
the
indians
of
america
controlled
his
temper
and
turning
to
the
young
franciscan
said
with
god
my
father
but
do
not
try
me
any
more
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
in
those
times
and
such
a
place
a
man
like
don
gregorio
de
hinostrosa
who
had
passed
his
life
upon
the
frontiers
and
who
held
supreme
authority
would
quietly
submit
to
such
a
public
insult
so
one
night
he
appeared
at
the
bishop
palace
accompanied
by
soldiers
to
arrest
don
pedro
out
came
cardenas
and
excommunicated
the
governor
and
all
his
soldiers
on
the
spot
and
don
pedro
pointed
a
pistol
at
his
head
he
seeing
himself
obliged
either
to
make
a
public
scandal
or
retire
being
for
peace
at
any
price
retired
and
the
triumphant
bishop
published
his
edict
of
excommunication
which
he
extended
with
a
fine
of
fifty
crowns
to
every
soldier
who
had
been
present
at
the
scene
on
reflection
thinking
perhaps
it
was
unwise
to
excommunicate
so
many
soldiers
who
might
be
needed
to
repel
an
indian
attack
he
sent
and
told
the
governor
he
was
ready
to
absolve
him
upon
easy
terms
the
governor
who
had
made
light
of
the
first
excommunication
was
rather
staggered
when
he
found
the
second
posted
at
the
cathedral
door
and
now
a
comedy
ensued
for
don
gregorio
went
to
the
bishop
and
on
his
knees
asked
for
forgiveness
he
taken
unawares
also
knelt
down
and
when
the
governor
kissed
his
hand
wished
to
return
the
compliment
and
would
have
done
so
had
the
rector
of
the
jesuit
college
not
prevented
him
as
charlevoix
says
see
them
on
their
knees
no
one
could
have
imagined
which
one
it
was
who
asked
the
other
grace
the
bishop
granted
absolution
to
the
governor
but
the
soldiers
action
had
been
flat
sacrilege
at
least
for
every
one
of
them
was
forced
to
pay
the
fine
two
excommunications
in
a
week
were
almost
one
would
think
enough
to
satisfy
a
pope
but
having
nominated
one
diego
hernandez
a
portuguese
to
the
post
of
alguacil
mayor
of
the
inquisition
and
given
him
the
right
to
wear
a
sword
in
virtue
of
his
office
the
governor
meeting
the
man
in
the
street
wearing
a
sword
against
his
regulations
made
him
a
prisoner
at
once
don
bernardino
launched
another
excommunication
but
this
time
he
had
gone
too
far
the
governor
laughed
at
his
thunder
and
condemned
the
prisoner
to
be
hanged
at
his
wits
end
the
bishop
sent
a
servant
to
the
man
and
told
him
to
fear
nothing
for
that
if
he
suffered
death
he
was
a
martyr
and
that
he
himself
would
preach
his
funeral
sermon
the
governor
who
was
perhaps
a
humorist
laughed
at
the
message
which
he
said
was
not
consoling
and
then
himself
let
hernandez
out
of
prison
under
heavy
bail
the
excommunication
was
then
taken
off
and
peace
once
more
reigned
in
asuncion
as
well
as
being
not
given
to
wine
it
is
essential
that
a
bishop
shall
know
how
to
keep
his
own
counsel
as
lorenzo
gracian
expresses
it
to
lie
but
not
for
that
to
speak
out
always
the
whole
truth
everyone
who
knew
the
bishop
and
his
hasty
temper
was
astonished
at
his
behaviour
to
the
jesuits
no
one
imagined
he
had
forgotten
the
attitude
the
rector
of
the
university
of
cordova
had
assumed
towards
his
consecration
and
still
the
bishop
seemed
to
show
more
favour
to
the
jesuits
in
asuncion
than
to
the
members
of
the
other
religious
communities
perhaps
he
felt
the
want
of
partisans
amongst
the
educated
classes
for
his
quarrel
with
the
governor
had
lost
him
many
friends
certainly
in
asuncion
it
was
of
great
importance
that
the
jesuits
should
not
declare
against
him
openly
manual
y
arte
de
prudencia
amsterdam
en
casa
de
juan
blau
he
praised
them
fulsomely
both
in
the
pulpit
and
in
conversation
went
in
procession
to
their
church
and
treated
them
in
public
with
marked
consideration
as
a
contemporaneous
jesuit
has
left
a
record
they
were
not
his
dupes
but
still
endeavoured
to
live
up
to
the
praises
he
dispensed
to
them
he
went
so
far
as
in
a
letter
to
the
king
philip
to
say
that
the
jesuits
only
in
all
paraguay
were
really
fitted
to
have
the
care
of
indians
and
he
advised
the
king
to
transfer
the
indians
who
were
under
other
religious
bodies
as
well
as
those
under
the
secular
clergy
to
the
care
and
guidance
of
that
order
no
doubt
in
this
the
bishop
was
right
even
if
not
sincere
one
of
the
qualifications
the
jesuits
had
for
the
care
of
indians
was
that
the
indians
did
not
look
on
them
as
spaniards
as
in
the
same
way
that
in
matabeleland
perhaps
a
german
frenchman
or
italian
is
less
hateful
to
the
natives
than
an
englishman
so
in
paraguay
the
indians
liked
the
jesuits
better
than
the
other
orders
for
there
were
many
foreigners
amongst
their
ranks
the
jesuits
soon
comprehended
that
the
bishop
wished
to
make
them
odious
to
the
public
by
overpraise
to
set
to
work
in
such
a
manner
almost
requires
an
early
training
in
a
seminary
and
that
such
tactics
should
have
been
put
in
force
against
such
skilled
diplomatists
as
were
the
jesuits
argues
no
ordinary
capacity
for
diplomatic
work
in
cardenas
with
him
however
the
spanish
proverb
the
word
and
deed
the
space
is
great
had
little
application
the
vicar
of
a
place
called
arecaya
close
to
asuncion
had
fallen
into
disgrace
the
bishop
removed
him
from
his
parish
and
asked
the
rector
of
the
jesuit
college
to
send
a
priest
to
take
his
place
the
answer
he
received
was
politic
and
to
the
effect
that
there
was
no
jesuit
who
could
be
spared
and
even
if
there
was
it
any
jesuit
to
infringe
upon
the
duties
of
the
secular
clergy
but
that
if
cardenas
intended
to
found
a
new
reduction
with
all
the
privileges
that
the
king
had
always
given
to
that
kind
of
establishment
the
rector
himself
would
ask
permission
from
his
provincial
to
undertake
the
work
a
splendid
answer
and
one
which
proved
that
the
man
who
gave
it
was
a
man
wasted
in
paraguay
and
that
his
place
by
rights
was
rome
or
at
the
least
some
court
don
bernardino
who
in
matters
such
as
these
was
quite
as
cunning
as
the
rector
thanked
him
and
said
he
did
not
want
a
saint
but
a
priest
to
take
the
duty
of
another
priest
for
a
short
time
the
rector
seeing
his
diplomacy
had
failed
told
father
mansilla
who
was
at
itatines
to
transfer
himself
to
arecaya
and
writing
to
the
bishop
told
him
that
he
had
no
doubt
mansilla
would
do
all
that
was
fitting
in
the
case
the
bishop
who
had
gained
his
point
and
saw
no
further
use
for
diplomacy
said
that
i
am
quite
sure
and
if
he
does
not
i
shall
excommunicate
him
and
lay
the
district
of
the
itatines
under
an
interdict
nothing
appeared
to
give
don
bernardino
such
unmitigated
pleasure
as
an
excommunication
on
the
slightest
protest
he
was
ready
so
that
during
his
episcopate
someone
or
other
in
asuncion
must
have
always
been
under
the
ban
of
holy
mother
church
the
rector
felt
instinctively
that
don
bernardino
had
not
done
with
him
this
was
the
case
for
soon
another
order
came
to
send
two
jesuits
to
undertake
the
guidance
of
a
mission
near
villa
rica
as
at
the
time
the
jesuits
had
no
missions
near
villa
rica
the
order
was
most
unpleasant
to
him
firstly
the
two
who
went
fathers
gomez
and
domenecchi
had
to
leave
their
missions
and
undertake
a
lengthy
journey
in
the
wilds
on
reaching
villa
rica
they
found
not
only
that
the
inhabitants
looked
on
them
with
great
disfavour
as
interlopers
but
that
the
indians
whom
they
were
sent
to
guide
were
under
the
system
thus
forcing
them
to
wink
at
that
which
they
disapproved
the
resolution
that
they
took
did
them
great
honour
it
was
to
leave
the
town
of
villa
rica
and
live
out
in
the
forests
with
the
indians
the
jesuits
of
the
college
at
asuncion
felt
the
situation
keenly
people
began
to
murmur
at
them
for
their
invasion
of
the
spiritual
domains
of
others
and
the
rector
in
despair
sent
to
the
bishop
and
begged
him
not
to
praise
them
in
his
sermons
nothing
cost
cardenas
so
little
as
to
promise
so
he
promised
not
to
mention
them
again
and
next
time
that
he
preached
he
spent
an
hour
in
telling
of
the
wonders
that
the
jesuits
had
done
in
saving
souls
not
only
amongst
catholics
but
also
amongst
the
infidels
and
turks
the
tactics
of
the
bishop
were
so
marked
that
at
last
a
rumour
reached
don
melchior
maldonado
the
bishop
of
tucuman
of
whom
don
bernardino
always
stood
in
dread
his
letter
somehow
became
public
and
as
in
it
he
spoke
most
warmly
of
the
jesuits
and
praised
the
rector
the
public
turned
again
upon
their
side
just
at
this
time
however
the
sleeping
feud
between
the
bishop
and
the
governor
broke
out
anew
with
so
much
fury
that
attention
was
directed
from
the
jesuits
for
the
time
being
but
on
them
the
situation
still
was
hung
and
both
sides
made
advances
to
them
for
support

prudent

time

yet
strong
enough

not

openly

still
following
up
his
evil
courses
poor
don
gregorio
hinostrosa
accustomed
all
his
life
to
deal
with
and
gentlemen
thought
fit
to
bring
this
under
his
uncle
notice
the
bishop
spoke
to
his
nephew
in
a
paternal
fashion
enjoining
certain
penances
upon
him
and
amongst
others
that
he
was
to
kiss
the
earth
although
don
pedro
cardenas
was
not
a
man
accustomed
to
lavish
kisses
on
things
inanimate
he
complied
but
though
complying
still
pursued
his
vicious
course
quite
in
the
manner
of
king
charles
of
pious
memory
the
governor
determined
to
arrest
the
recalcitrant
with
his
own
hand
armed
to
the
teeth
and
with
a
band
of
musketeers
accompanying
him
he
appeared
before
the
convent
of
francis
where
father
cardenas
had
taken
refuge
and
dragging
him
from
his
bed
haled
him
incontinently
to
the
river
bank
and
left
him
gagged
and
bound
a
prey
to
flies
and
sun
for
two
whole
days
dressed
in
his
drawers
and
shirt
on
the
third
day
he
was
embarked
in
a
canoe
for
corrientes
with
a
small
quantity
of
jerked
beef
for
all
provision
and
a
woman
cloak
wrapped
round
his
shoulders
to
shield
him
from
the
cold
not
quite
the
guise
in
which
a
clergyman
would
care
to
appear
before
the
eyes
of
his
superiors
even
in
paraguay
naturally
the
bishop
having
nothing
else
to
do
got
out
his
excommunication
in
his
usual
style
but
no
man
marked
him
meantime
asuncion
was
in
confusion
the
bishop
and
the
governor
keeping
no
measure
with
the
other
man
of
sin
one
tried
to
obtain
possession
of
the
other
person
to
throw
him
into
prison
the
other
strove
to
animate
the
preachers
in
the
various
churches
to
consign
his
rival
soul
to
hell
in
the
deserted
streets
drums
thundered
whilst
in
the
air
bells
jangled
and
the
quiet
sleepy
town
was
rent
in
twain
by
the
dissensions
of
the
opposing
powers
the
churches
closed
their
doors
and
the
consolations
of
religion
were
withdrawn
from
those
who
wanted
them
to
add
to
the
confusion
don
pedro
cardenas
escaped
from
corrientes
and
having
taken
to
himself
a
companion
one
francisco
sanchez
de
carreras
raged
through
the
city
like
a
devil
unchained
in
his
extremity
the
poor
bishop
went
to
the
jesuits
for
advice
informing
them
he
could
not
stand
the
scandals
that
were
taking
place
and
that
he
intended
to
leave
the
city
after
launching
an
interdict
of
excommunication
upon
all
placed
in
the
position
of
declaring
openly
either
for
bishop
or
for
governor
the
jesuits
refused
an
answer
knowing
that
anything
they
said
would
be
brought
up
against
them
all
their
advice
to
him
was
trust
in
god
to
persevere
in
his
good
efforts
to
resign
himself
to
divine
will
which
will
as
the
bishop
knew
full
well
worked
sometimes
in
a
mysterious
fashion
for
the
welfare
of
the
soul
the
bishop
answered
this
advice
sechement
taking
it
for
a
reproach
and
as
a
sort
of
thing
not
to
be
tolerated
amongst
professionals
as
if
one
lawyer
having
gone
to
another
for
his
advice
upon
a
private
matter
had
received
for
answer
a
lecture
on
conveyancing
or
a
short
treatise
upon
roman
law
charlevoix
still
the
occasion
called
for
something
to
be
done
so
calling
an
indian
servant
he
stripped
to
the
waist
and
to
the
horror
and
amazement
of
the
public
appeared
with
naked
feet
and
shoulders
dressed
in
a
sack
and
armed
with
a
heavy
scourge
at
the
first
blow
he
gave
himself
some
canons
of
the
cathedral
begged
him
to
desist
but
he
after
prayer
replied
that
he
intended
so
to
speak
to
act
as
his
own
pascal
lamb
and
wipe
out
the
affront
done
to
francis
in
his
unworthy
blood
a
naked
bishop
in
a
sack
is
almost
sure
to
attract
some
observation
even
in
paraguay
religious
women
not
unfrequently
have
been
attracted
by
such
a
spectacle
and
so
it
proved
on
this
occasion
although
the
jesuits
and
the
saner
portion
of
the
population
blamed
the
bishop
action
he
made
himself
a
host
of
partisans
amongst
the
women
of
all
classes
who
followed
him
as
they
have
often
followed
other
thaumaturgists
in
times
present
and
gone
by
his
friend
don
melchior
maldonado
hearing
what
had
passed
wrote
to
reprove
him
for
his
inconsiderate
zeal
in
his
epistle
he
observed
that
though
some
of
the
apostles
had
scourged
themselves
it
was
not
their
habit
to
appear
half
naked
before
a
crowd
of
women
that
our
lord
himself
had
not
of
his
own
accord
taken
off
his
garments
for
the
scourger
that
saints
who
scourged
themselves
had
as
a
general
rule
chosen
a
private
place
for
their
this
was
quite
reasonable
but
the
advice
was
little
to
the
taste
of
the
recipient
who
hated
criticism
when
levelled
at
himself
if
crosses
make
a
saint
about
this
time
don
bernardino
had
his
full
share
of
them
news
came
from
itatines
where
the
two
jesuits
had
been
marooned
that
both
of
them
were
cardenas
who
we
may
remember
was
a
visions
called
in
the
rector
of
the
jesuit
college
to
inform
him
that
the
company
of
jesus
had
a
new
martyr
in
their
ranks
though
martyrs
even
enter
the
ranks
of
general
loyola
army
pretty
frequently
it
still
seemed
strange
that
the
bishop
should
know
of
this
particular
recruit
before
the
rector
pressed
for
an
explanation
he
replied
that
a
pious
person
who
was
vouchsafed
communication
with
the
lord
in
prayer
had
seen
father
domenecchi
in
heaven
shining
in
glory
and
with
a
halo
round
his
head
nothing
could
be
more
satisfactory
all
the
essentials
of
a
miracle
had
been
complied
with
a
man
was
dead
another
man
had
seen
the
dead
man
in
an
ecstasy
of
prayer
and
to
make
all
complete
refused
to
testify
himself
sending
the
bishop
as
a
sort
of
pious
phonograph
no
true
believer
in
such
a
case
could
doubt
and
all
went
well
till
it
appeared
a
man
from
itatines
charged
with
a
message
to
the
jesuit
college
had
passed
the
night
before
he
gave
his
message
at
the
bishop
house
in
holy
writ
we
read
the
wicked
man
shall
have
no
rest
if
this
is
so
it
is
as
it
should
be
though
generally
the
good
seem
just
as
troubled
in
their
lives
as
the
most
erring
of
their
brethren
he
who
would
be
a
saint
must
be
year
in
year
out
just
like
a
common
workman
and
cardenas
was
no
exception
to
the
rule
the
not
having
been
quite
a
success
he
turned
to
other
fields
and
summoned
all
the
inhabitants
of
paraguay
to
attend
at
the
cathedral
upon
a
certain
day
the
governor
thinking
there
was
a
revolution
likely
to
break
out
fixed
a
review
of
all
the
troops
for
the
same
date
a
jesuit
priest
waited
upon
the
bishop
to
persuade
him
that
the
crowds
which
would
assemble
might
break
the
peace
the
bishop
reassured
him
and
sent
him
to
the
governor
to
say
that
his
intention
was
to
preach
to
the
people
and
explain
to
them
the
faith
further
that
he
intended
on
that
day
to
raise
his
excommunication
and
be
reconciled
only
he
asked
him
to
allow
the
troops
to
attend
and
hear
his
sermon
the
crowd
was
great
the
bishop
mounted
the
pulpit
and
extending
his
forefinger
in
the
attitude
of
malediction
so
dear
to
bishops
straight
began
to
preach
for
a
time
all
went
well
the
governor
presumably
was
waiting
for
the
circulation
of
the
hat
that
awful
mystery
which
makes
all
sects
kin
when
to
his
horror
cardenas
began
to
enumerate
all
his
offences
he
was
anathema
was
excommunicated
a
disbeliever
and
had
endeavoured
to
cast
down
that
which
the
lord
himself
had
set
on
high
the
bishop
then
informed
the
crowd
that
god
was
angry
with
the
governor
talked
about
moses
and
dwelt
with
unction
on
the
fact
that
the
great
lawgiver
had
been
swift
to
slay
in
a
peroration
which
no
doubt
went
home
to
all
he
called
upon
his
hearers
under
penalty
of
a
heavy
fine
and
his
displeasure
to
seize
the
governor
adding
that
if
there
was
resistance
should
kill
his
brother
his
friend
or
his
nearest
relative
after
these
words
he
seized
a
banner
from
the
hands
of
the
astonished
officer
who
stood
nearest
to
him
and
stood
forth
like
another
phineas
surrounded
by
his
clergy
all
of
whom
had
arms
beneath
their
cloaks
exod
a
most
dramatic
scene
and
probably
almost
successful
had
but
the
bishop
only
reckoned
with
two
things
firstly
he
had
forgotten
that
the
governor
was
an
old
indian
fighter
and
ready
for
surprises
and
secondly
he
had
not
taken
into
account
the
usual
apathy
of
the
common
people
when
their
leaders
fight
dumbly
and
quite
unmoved
the
people
stood
staring
like
armadillos
at
a
snake
and
made
no
sign
then
word
was
brought
that
the
governor
had
left
the
church
and
was
assembling
a
force
of
arquebusiers
surrounded
only
by
clergymen
don
bernardino
had
to
yield
and
yielded
like
a
levite
with
a
subterfuge
he
sent
a
priest
to
beg
the
magistrates
to
come
to
the
cathedral
and
reason
with
him
after
a
consultation
this
was
done
and
cardenas
consented
to
abate
his
fury
and
exhale
his
wrath
he
said
that
holy
writ
itself
gave
leave
to
recur
to
force
in
but
did
not
quote
the
text
and
that
the
governor
had
meditated
a
like
enterprise
against
himself
moreover
that
he
being
an
excommunicated
man
it
became
lawful
for
god
vicegerent
to
lay
hold
on
him
after
the
scene
was
over
and
the
bishop
was
escorted
back
to
his
palace
by
the
magistrates
a
second
letter
came
from
tucuman
making
plain
his
conduct
to
him
after
the
manner
of
a
friend
the
rector
of
the
jesuits
also
thought
fit
to
remonstrate
and
say
that
cardenas
had
gone
too
far
in
attempting
to
assume
the
temporal
power
this
sufficed
to
further
strain
the
relations
between
the
bishop
and
the
jesuits
as
even
in
asuncion
in
it
was
unusual
that
the
governor
should
remain
for
ever
under
the
ban
of
holy
mother
church
arbiters
were
chosen
to
discuss
the
matter
and
provide
means
whereby
the
bishop
could
conveniently
climb
down
the
arbiters
absolved
the
governor
on
the
condition
that
he
paid
a
fine
of
four
thousand
of
mate
which
in
money
amounted
to
eight
thousand
crowns
quite
naturally
the
bishop
refused
to
abide
by
the
decision
replaced
his
adversary
under
the
ban
and
recommenced
to
preach
against
him
with
considerable
force
the
arroba
is
about
pounds
weight
the
higgling
of
the
market
not
having
proved
effectual
in
the
adjustment
of
the
sum
to
be
paid
by
the
governor
a
priest
one
juan
lozano
who
had
been
condemned
to
imprisonment
by
his
superiors
for
his
loose
life
and
who
had
taken
refuge
with
the
bishop
hit
on
a
stroke
of
veritable
genius
at
a
conference
which
took
place
between
the
bishop
and
several
notables
of
the
place
including
the
rector
of
the
jesuits
lozano
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
if
the
governor
refused
to
pay
a
general
interdict
should
be
proclaimed
the
rector
of
the
jesuits
retired
indignantly
and
lozano
retroussant
sa
robe
le
poursuivit
en
criant
pleine
et
en
des
termes
peu
seans
sa
profession
by
this
time
asuncion
must
have
been
like
a
madhouse
for
no
one
seems
to
have
been
astonished
or
even
to
have
thought
his
conduct
singular
the
bishop
always
ready
to
take
the
worst
advice
got
ready
for
his
task
and
on
easter
eve
embarked
upon
the
river
leaving
his
under
orders
to
proclaim
the
general
ban
this
was
done
and
the
edict
so
contrived
as
to
catch
the
luckless
governor
in
every
church
the
practical
effect
was
to
close
all
the
churches
for
to
whatever
church
the
governor
went
the
priest
refused
to
celebrate
the
mass
several
other
persons
were
mentioned
in
the
ban
which
was
posted
up
below
a
crucifix
in
the
choir
of
the
cathedral
as
don
bernardino
had
omitted
to
state
the
particular
offences
for
which
they
were
condemned
the
general
confusion
became
intense
and
no
one
attended
mass
so
that
the
churches
were
deserted
after
a
little
some
of
the
churches
opened
in
a
clandestine
manner
others
remained
closed
and
the
followers
of
the
bishop
and
the
governor
alternately
assembled
in
a
rabble
and
threw
stones
at
all
the
churches
dispensing
their
favours
quite
impartially
the
various
religious
orders
not
to
be
behindhand
also
took
sides
the
jesuits
giving
as
their
opinion
that
the
governor
not
having
a
war
upon
his
back
was
really
excommunicated
the
dominicans
holding
that
the
bishop
in
the
general
interest
ought
to
absolve
him
he
armed
with
the
opinion
of
the
latter
order
marched
to
the
dwelling
of
the
bishop
and
having
nailed
up
both
doors
and
windows
sent
a
trumpeter
to
tell
him
he
should
not
leave
his
house
till
absolution
had
been
granted
still
nothing
came
of
it
and
then
the
governor
did
what
he
should
have
done
at
first
he
sent
a
statement
of
the
whole
proceedings
to
the
high
court
at
charcas
this
high
court
audiencia
was
situated
right
in
the
middle
of
what
is
now
bolivia
miles
away
from
lima
half
a
world
from
paraguay
at
least
two
thousand
miles
from
buenos
ayres
and
separated
from
chile
by
the
whole
cordillera
of
the
andes
even
the
journey
from
paraguay
often
exceeds
a
month
charlevoix
the
bishop
not
to
be
outdone
also
prepared
a
statement
in
which
he
accused
his
adversary
of
all
the
crimes
that
he
could
think
of
and
confirmed
his
statement
with
an
oath
the
chapter
thinking
things
were
in
an
impossible
condition
besought
that
the
fine
laid
on
the
excommunicated
folk
should
be
raised
or
lessened
as
it
appeared
to
them
there
was
not
money
in
the
town
to
satisfy
it
cardenas
refused
and
thus
four
months
elapsed
soon
after
this
arrived
one
father
truxillo
of
the
order
of
francis
who
came
from
tucuman
as
cardenas
thinking
as
they
were
both
franciscans
that
truxillo
must
needs
be
favourable
to
his
cause
made
him
his
with
power
to
bind
and
to
unloose
that
is
to
free
the
excommunicated
folk
from
all
their
disabilities
if
on
examination
it
seemed
good
to
him
truxillo
who
was
quite
unbiassed
as
to
matters
in
asuncion
looked
into
everything
and
declared
the
governor
and
everybody
ought
to
be
absolved
he
further
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
the
affair
having
gone
to
the
high
court
at
charcas
he
could
do
nothing
but
give
an
interim
decree
don
bernardino
heard
the
news
at
itati
an
indian
village
a
few
miles
outside
asuncion
from
thence
he
went
to
a
somewhat
larger
village
called
yaguaron
and
shut
himself
up
in
a
convent
after
declaring
everyone
except
the
superior
clergy
under
the
severest
censure
of
the
church
if
they
should
dare
approach
not
a
bad
place
for
prayer
and
meditation
is
yaguaron
a
score
or
two
of
little
houses
built
of
straw
and
wood
and
thatched
with
straggle
on
the
hillside
above
the
shores
of
a
great
lake
parrots
scream
noisily
amongst
the
trees
and
red
macaws
hover
like
hawks
over
the
little
patches
of
maize
and
mandioca
planted
amongst
the
palms
round
every
house
is
set
a
grove
of
mingled
with
lemons
sweet
limes
and
guayabas
inside
the
houses
all
is
so
clean
that
you
could
eat
from
any
floor
with
less
repulsion
than
from
the
plates
at
a
hotel
a
place
where
life
slips
on
as
listless
and
luxuriant
as
the
growth
of
a
banana
and
where
at
evening
time
when
the
women
of
the
place
go
to
fetch
water
in
a
long
line
with
earthen
jars
balanced
upon
their
heads
the
golden
age
seems
less
improbable
even
than
in
theocritus
to
yaguaron
the
higher
clergy
flocked
to
intercede
for
the
good
people
of
asuncion
all
except
father
truxillo
who
knowing
something
of
his
bishop
did
not
go
that
he
was
wise
events
proved
shortly
two
canons
diego
ponce
de
leon
and
fernando
sanchez
he
imprisoned
in
their
rooms
calling
them
traitors
to
their
bishop
and
their
church
deputations
came
from
the
capital
to
beg
for
their
release
but
all
in
vain
the
bishop
answered
them
that
he
had
set
his
mind
to
purge
his
diocese
of
traitors
and
the
two
canons
remained
in
prison
after
a
detention
which
lasted
forty
days
they
escaped
and
fled
to
corrientes
which
must
have
looked
upon
asuncion
as
a
vast
madhouse
truxillo
who
seems
to
have
been
a
man
not
quite
so
absolutely
devoid
of
sense
as
the
other
clergy
endeavoured
to
organize
a
religious
but
most
unfortunately
a
letter
he
had
written
to
some
of
the
saner
clergy
fell
into
the
bishop
hands
excommunications
now
positively
rained
upon
the
land
the
governor
the
jesuits
the
dominicans
each
had
their
turn
but
curiously
enough
the
poorer
people
still
stood
firm
to
cardenas
thinking
no
doubt
a
man
who
treated
all
the
richer
sort
so
harshly
must
do
something
for
the
poor
nothing
however
was
further
from
the
thoughts
of
cardenas
who
thought
the
whole
world
circled
round
himself
the
bishop
nephew
having
returned
to
corrientes
and
his
former
naughty
life
don
bernardino
casting
about
for
another
secretary
came
on
one
francisco
nieto
an
apostate
from
the
order
of
francis
and
living
openly
with
an
indian
woman
by
whom
he
had
a
son
him
the
bishop
made
his
chaplain
then
his
confessor
and
poor
nieto
found
himself
obliged
to
send
his
indian
wife
away
in
spite
of
all
his
protests
and
his
wish
to
live
obscurely
as
he
had
been
living
before
his
elevation
to
the
post
of
secretary
a
veritable
beachcomber
father
francisco
nieto
seems
to
have
been
and
the
type
of
many
a
european
in
paraguay
who
asks
no
better
than
to
forget
the
tedium
of
our
modern
life
and
pass
his
days
in
a
little
hut
lost
in
a
clearing
of
a
wood
or
near
some
lake
camalote
is
a
species
of
which
forms
a
thick
covering
on
stagnant
rivers
and
lakes
in
paraguay
and
in
the
argentine
republic
so
in
asuncion
things
went
from
bad
to
worse
such
trade
as
then
existed
was
at
a
standstill
and
bands
of
starving
people
swarmed
in
the
streets
whilst
the
incursions
of
the
savage
indians
daily
became
more
frequent
in
fact
asuncion
was
but
a
type
of
what
the
world
would
be
under
the
domination
of
any
of
the
sects
without
the
counterpoise
of
any
civil
power
the
governor
seeing
the
misery
on
every
side
determined
like
an
honest
man
to
pocket
up
his
pride
and
reconcile
himself
with
cardenas
at
any
price
so
setting
forth
with
all
his
staff
he
came
to
yaguaron
there
like
a
penitent
he
had
to
bear
a
reprimand
before
the
assembled
village
and
engage
to
pay
a
fine
before
the
rancorous
churchman
would
relieve
him
from
the
ban
the
weakness
of
the
governor
had
the
effect
that
might
have
been
expected
and
heavy
fines
were
laid
on
all
and
sundry
who
had
in
any
manner
displeased
the
bishop
or
leaned
to
the
other
side
in
the
course
of
the
dispute
right
in
the
middle
of
the
struggle
between
the
clerical
and
lay
authorities
a
band
of
over
three
hundred
guaycurus
appeared
before
the
town
unluckily
all
the
chief
officers
of
the
garrison
were
excommunicated
and
thus
incapable
of
doing
anything
to
defend
the
place
foolish
as
cardenas
most
indubitably
was
his
folly
did
not
carry
him
so
far
as
to
leave
the
capital
of
his
diocese
quite
undefended
still
he
would
not
give
way
first
and
only
at
the
moment
when
the
indians
seemed
prepared
to
attack
the
town
at
the
entreaty
of
a
virgin
he
raised
the
excommunication
on
the
governor
and
his
officers
for
fifteen
days
the
governor
instead
of
like
a
sensible
man
seizing
the
bishop
and
giving
him
to
the
of
the
guaycurus
led
out
his
troops
and
drove
the
indians
off
that
very
night
he
found
himself
once
more
under
the
censure
of
the
church
and
the
conflict
with
his
opponent
more
bitter
than
at
first
the
viceroy
of
peru
the
marquis
of
mancera
indignant
at
the
weakness
of
the
governor
wrote
sharply
to
him
reprimanding
him
and
telling
him
at
once
to
assert
himself
and
force
the
bishop
to
confine
himself
to
matters
spiritual
on
the
governor
attempt
to
reassert
himself
the
answer
was
a
general
interdict
laying
the
entire
capital
under
the
church
ban
on
this
he
marched
to
yaguaron
with
all
his
troops
resolved
to
take
the
bishop
prisoner
but
he
seeing
the
troops
approach
went
out
at
once
fell
on
the
governor
neck
and
straightway
absolved
him
after
the
absolution
came
a
banquet
which
must
have
been
a
little
constrained
one
might
imagine
and
even
less
amusing
than
the
regulation
of
the
london
season
where
one
sits
between
two
and
perspiring
women
eating
meat
and
drinking
fiery
wines
with
the
thermometer
at
eighty
in
the
shade
thus
disembarrassed
from
the
governor
don
bernardino
turned
his
attention
to
the
jesuits
and
signified
to
them
that
he
intended
to
take
the
education
of
the
young
out
of
their
hands
this
was
a
mortal
affront
to
the
jesuits
as
they
have
always
understood
that
men
just
as
the
other
animals
can
only
learn
whilst
young
hard
upon
this
new
step
cardenas
issued
an
edict
forbidding
them
to
preach
or
hear
confessions
as
for
the
governor
the
bishop
did
not
fear
him
and
the
poorer
people
of
asuncion
had
always
inclined
to
the
bishop
party
either
through
terror
of
the
church
ban
or
from
their
natural
instinct
that
the
bishop
was
against
the
government
but
cardenas
saw
clearly
that
to
deal
as
he
wished
with
the
jesuits
he
must
entirely
gain
the
governor
confidence
this
he
tried
to
do
by
sending
to
him
one
father
lopez
provincial
of
the
dominicans
this
lopez
was
an
able
and
apparently
quite
honest
man
for
he
told
the
governor
that
the
wish
of
cardenas
was
to
expel
the
jesuits
from
paraguay
and
from
their
missions
warning
him
at
the
same
time
not
to
allow
himself
to
be
made
use
of
by
the
bishop
in
his
design
from
that
moment
the
two
adversaries
seemed
to
have
changed
characters
and
don
gregorio
became
as
cautious
as
a
churchman
whereas
the
bishop
seemed
to
lose
all
his
diplomacy
to
all
the
protestations
of
friendship
which
were
addressed
to
him
the
governor
answered
so
adroitly
that
the
bishop
fell
into
the
trap
and
thought
he
had
secured
a
partner
to
help
him
in
the
expulsion
of
the
jesuits
finally
at
yaguaron
during
a
sermon
he
formulated
his
celebrated
charges
against
the
jesuits
which
set
on
foot
by
him
in
eventually
caused
the
expulsion
of
the
whole
order
from
america
and
though
refuted
a
thousand
times
still
linger
in
the
writing
of
all
those
who
treat
the
question
down
to
the
present
day
the
charges
were
seven
in
number
and
so
ingeniously
contrived
that
royal
national
and
domestic
indignation
were
all
aroused
by
them
the
first
was
that
the
jesuits
prevented
the
indians
from
their
annual
taxes
to
the
crown
secondly
that
the
jesuits
kept
back
the
tithes
from
bishops
and
archbishops
thirdly
he
said
the
jesuits
had
rich
mines
in
their
possession
and
that
the
product
of
these
mines
was
all
sent
out
of
the
country
to
the
general
fund
at
rome
this
the
jesuits
disproved
on
several
occasions
but
as
often
happens
in
such
cases
proof
was
of
no
avail
against
the
folly
of
mankind
to
whom
it
seemed
incredible
that
the
jesuits
should
bury
themselves
in
deserts
to
preach
to
savages
unless
there
was
some
countervailing
advantage
to
be
gained
even
the
fact
that
at
the
expulsion
of
the
company
of
jesus
from
america
no
treasure
at
all
was
found
at
any
of
their
colleges
or
missions
did
not
dispel
the
conviction
that
they
owned
rich
mines
the
fourth
charge
was
that
the
jesuits
were
not
particular
about
the
secrets
of
the
confessional
and
that
they
used
the
information
thus
acquired
for
their
own
selfish
ends
further
that
father
ruiz
de
montoya
had
acquired
from
the
king
under
a
misapprehension
a
royal
edict
giving
the
territory
of
the
missions
to
the
jesuits
thus
taking
the
fruits
of
their
conquest
from
the
spanish
colonists
fifthly
that
the
jesuits
entered
paraguay
possessed
but
of
the
clothes
upon
their
backs
that
they
had
made
themselves
into
the
sovereign
rulers
of
a
great
territory
but
that
he
was
going
to
expel
them
as
the
venetians
had
expelled
them
from
venetia
sixthly
that
even
the
portuguese
of
san
paulo
de
piritinanga
had
expelled
them
his
last
assertion
was
that
he
himself
together
with
the
bishop
of
tucuman
and
others
had
secret
orders
from
the
king
to
expel
the
jesuits
from
their
dioceses
but
that
the
other
bishops
lacked
the
courage
which
he
cardenas
was
then
about
to
show
he
wound
up
all
by
saying
that
once
the
jesuits
were
gone
the
king
would
once
again
enjoy
his
rights
the
church
be
once
again
restored
to
freedom
and
lastly
that
there
would
be
plenty
of
indians
for
the
settlers
to
enslave
quite
possibly
enough
the
public
ever
generous
to
a
fault
with
other
people
goods
cared
little
for
the
rights
of
a
king
who
lived
ten
thousand
miles
away
and
as
for
the
church
it
seems
most
probable
they
failed
to
see
the
peril
that
she
ran
but
when
the
bishop
spoke
of
enslaving
the
indians
they
saw
the
jesuits
must
go
for
from
the
conquest
the
jesuits
had
stood
between
the
settlers
and
their
prey
all
things
considered
don
bernardino
made
a
remarkable
discourse
that
sunday
morning
in
the
village
by
the
lake
for
the
echo
of
it
still
resounds
in
the
religious
world
against
the
jesuits
this
was
untrue
as
the
jesuit
missions
were
not
at
that
time
apportioned
into
parishes
under
the
authority
of
the
jesuits
and
such
tribute
as
then
was
customary
was
all
collected
by
government
officials
this
was
also
untrue
as
the
tithes
were
never
regulated
in
paraguay
till
this
accusation
was
quite
untrue
for
the
edict
referred
to
was
not
obtained
under
misapprehension
but
after
a
complete
exposition
of
all
the
facts
moreover
it
was
subsequently
renewed
on
several
occasions
by
the
spanish
kings
the
venetians
did
not
expel
the
jesuits
they
left
venetia
of
their
own
accord
fathers
montoya
and
tano
went
respectively
to
rome
and
to
madrid
to
lay
the
sorrows
of
the
indians
before
the
king
and
pope
having
obtained
the
edict
from
the
king
that
cardenas
referred
to
and
a
brief
from
the
pope
urban
viii
forbidding
slavery
they
had
the
hardihood
to
appear
within
the
city
of
san
paulo
and
affix
both
edicts
to
the
church
door
as
was
to
be
expected
the
paulistas
immediately
expelled
them
from
their
territories
and
hence
the
of
the
sixth
charge
made
by
bishop
cardenas
like
other
men
after
a
notable
pronouncement
it
is
most
probable
that
cardenas
was
unaware
of
the
full
import
of
his
words
perhaps
he
thought
as
speakers
will
that
all
the
best
portions
of
his
sermon
had
been
left
unsaid
be
that
as
it
may
he
shortly
turned
his
thoughts
to
other
matters
of
more
direct
importance
to
himself
in
judging
of
his
life
it
should
not
be
forgotten
that
by
his
sermon
at
yaguaron
he
placed
himself
upon
the
side
of
those
who
wanted
to
enslave
the
indians
perhaps
he
did
not
know
this
and
certainly
his
popularity
amongst
the
indians
outside
the
missions
was
enormous
his
next
adventure
was
to
try
and
eject
the
jesuits
from
a
farm
they
had
called
san
isidro
the
governor
having
forbidden
him
to
do
so
he
armed
an
army
of
his
partisans
to
expel
the
jesuits
from
their
college
in
the
capital
outside
asuncion
the
don
francisco
florez
met
the
bishop
secretary
father
nieto
who
informed
him
of
the
enterprise
exhorting
him
to
enlist
the
sympathies
of
the
governor
in
so
good
a
cause
florez
a
better
diplomatist
than
his
commanding
officer
seemed
to
approve
and
naturally
deceived
poor
father
nieto
who
like
most
hypocrites
became
an
easy
prey
to
his
own
tactics
when
used
against
himself
florez
informed
the
governor
at
once
and
he
sent
to
the
jesuits
and
put
them
on
their
guard
next
day
he
met
the
bishop
and
told
him
that
his
enterprise
could
not
succeed
as
the
jesuits
were
under
arms
no
doubt
he
learned
these
artifices
in
his
campaigns
against
the
indians
of
arauco
or
it
may
have
been
that
like
others
who
have
had
to
strive
with
churchmen
he
learned
to
beat
them
with
their
own
controversial
arms
the
bishop
fell
completely
into
the
snare
and
thinking
the
governor
was
a
fast
friend
confided
all
his
plans
to
him
for
the
expulsion
of
the
jesuits
and
the
conquest
of
the
mission
territory
just
then
captain
don
pedro
diaz
del
valle
came
from
la
plata
and
gave
don
bernardino
a
new
decision
of
the
high
court
of
charcas
telling
him
to
live
in
peace
with
all
men
and
govern
his
diocese
with
zeal
he
certainly
was
zealous
to
an
extraordinary
degree
if
not
judicious
therefore
the
very
mention
of
the
word
must
have
been
peculiarly
offensive
to
such
a
zealous
man
the
letter
went
on
to
say
that
all
the
fines
he
had
exacted
were
illegal
and
commanded
him
to
give
back
the
which
he
had
extorted
from
his
involuntary
penitents
and
in
the
future
live
on
better
terms
with
all
around
him
to
all
of
this
he
paid
no
notice
as
was
to
be
expected
but
to
avoid
returning
the
sent
a
letter
to
his
officers
to
have
it
burned
this
letter
which
he
denied
was
subsequently
produced
against
him
in
the
high
court
at
charcas
seeing
the
governor
was
bent
on
frustrating
or
on
deceiving
him
he
tried
to
get
from
don
sebastian
leon
who
held
an
office
under
the
governor
an
edict
of
the
emperor
charles
which
he
had
heard
was
in
the
archives
and
which
provided
that
in
case
a
governor
should
die
or
be
deposed
the
notables
of
the
place
had
power
to
appoint
an
interim
governor
to
fill
his
place
if
such
a
paper
ever
existed
it
must
have
been
a
very
early
document
given
by
charles
at
the
foundation
of
the
colony
for
nothing
was
more
opposed
to
the
traditions
of
spanish
policy
throughout
america
don
sebastian
leon
having
informed
the
governor
the
latter
saw
that
things
were
coming
to
a
crisis
and
that
either
he
or
the
bishop
would
have
to
leave
the
place
not
being
sure
of
all
his
troops
and
the
bishop
having
the
populace
upon
his
side
he
sent
to
the
jesuit
missions
for
six
hundred
indians
thus
the
supremacy
of
the
royal
government
fell
to
be
supported
by
men
but
just
emerging
from
a
life
who
owed
the
tincture
of
civilization
they
possessed
to
the
calumniated
jesuits
on
many
occasions
armies
of
indians
from
the
jesuit
missions
rendered
important
services
to
the
crown
of
spain
not
only
against
the
portuguese
but
against
english
corsairs
and
in
rebellions
as
in
the
case
of
cardenas
or
as
when
in
the
year
philip
wrote
to
the
governor
of
buenos
ayres
to
garrison
the
port
with
a
contingent
of
indians
from
the
jesuit
reductions
in
when
the
french
attacked
the
port
with
a
squadron
of
ships
and
at
the
first
siege
of
the
colonia
in
when
three
thousand
indians
marched
to
the
attack
accompanied
by
their
jesuit
pastors
but
under
the
command
of
spanish
officers
funes
civil

an
army
from
the
jesuit
missions
consisted
almost
entirely
of
cavalry
it
marched
much
like
a
south
american
army

twenty
years

and

a
troop
of
cattle
for
the
men
to
eat
when
jesuits
accompanied
the
army
they
did
not
enter
into
action
but
were
most
intrepid
in
succouring
the
wounded
under
fire
as

when
speaking
of
their
conduct
at
the
siege
of
the

for
arms

carried

slings

and
bolas
and
had

them
certain
very
long
english
guns
with
rests
to
fire
from
not
very
heavy
and
of
a
good
range
each
day
the
accompanying
jesuits
said
mass
and
each
town
carried
its
particular
banner
before
the
troop
they
generally
camped
if
possible
in
the
open
plain
both
to
avoid
surprises
and
for
convenience
in
guarding
the
cattle
and
the
in
all
the
territories
of
south
america
no
such
quiet
and
soldiery
was
to
be
found
for
in
chile
peru
mexico
and
guatemala
the
passage
of
an
army
was
similar
to
the
passing
of
a
swarm
of
locusts
in
its
effect
the
testimony
of
funes
is
as
follows

on
his
side
was
occupied
in
animating
the
populace
against
the
jesuits
with
all
the
fervour
of
an
apostle
naturally
he
first
commenced
by
launching
his
usual
sentence
of
excommunication
against
them
and
having
done
so
returned
again
to

this

which
in
times
gone
by
have
been

but
little
to
distinguish
it
nature
has
proved
too
powerful
in
the
for

to
fight
against

or

upon

him
exhausted
in
the
morning
with
the
loss
of
blood
when
cardenas
used
the
place
as
a
sort
of
avignon
from
which
to
safely
utter
his
anathemas
it
must
have
worn
a
different
aspect
no
doubt
processions
and
ceremonies
were
continual
with
carrying
about
the
saints
in
public
a
custom
which
the
paraguayans
irreverently
refer
to
as
luz
los
bultos
messengers
no
doubt
came
and
went
perpetually
as
is
the
custom
in
countries
such
as
paraguay
where
news
is
valuable
and
horseflesh
cheap
thereto
flocked
to
a
moral
certainty
all
the
broken
soldiers
who
swarmed
in
countries
like
peru
and
paraguay
with
indian
looking
out
for
work
to
do
when
white
men
quarrelled
and
throats
were
to
be
cut
priests
went
and
came
friars
and
missionaries
and
cardenas
most
certainly
who
loved
effect
gave
all
his
emerald
ring
to
kiss
and
made
those
promises
which
leaders
of
revolt
lavish
on
everyone
in
times
of
difficulty
literally
out
the
blocks
to
air
the
effigies
are
made
of
hard
and
heavy
wood
and
i
remember
once
in
concepcion
de
paraguay
assisting
on
a
sweltering
day
to
carry
a
madonna
weighing
about
five
hundredweight
when
the
indian
contingent
arrived
the
governor
marched
upon
yaguaron
although
the
air
was
positively
lurid
with
excommunications
the
bishop
rushing
to
the
church
was
intercepted
by
the
governor
who
seized
his
arm
and
tried
to
stop
him
cardenas
struggled
with
him
and
declared
him
excommunicated
for
laying
his
hand
upon
the
anointed
of
the
lord
but
most
unfortunately
there
was
no
at
hand
to
rid
the
governor
of
so
turbulent
a
priest
a
woman
rushed
to
the
bishop
aid
together
with
some
priests
this
gave
him
time
to
gain
the
altar
and
seize
the
host
which
he
exposed
at
once
to
the
public
gaze
and
for
the
moment
all
present
fell
upon
their
knees
turning
to
the
governor
he
asked
what
he
wanted
with
armed
men
in
a
church
the
governor
replied
he
had
come
to
banish
him
from
paraguay
by
order
of
the
viceroy
for
having
infringed
upon
the
temporal
power
cardenas
taken
aback
replied
he
would
obey
and
turning
to
the
people
took
them
all
for
witnesses
the
governor
no
doubt
thinking
he
was
dealing
with
an
honest
araucan
chief
retired
the
bishop
immediately
denounced
the
governor
in
a
furious
sermon
after
which
he
left
the
church
carrying
the
host
in
full
procession
accompanied
by
the
choir
singing
the
lingua
followed
by
a
band
of
indian
women
with
their
hair
dishevelled
and
carrying
green
branches
in
their
hands
he
then
returned
to
the
church
and
from
the
pulpit
denounced
the
governor
who
standing
at
the
door
surrounded
by
a
group
of
arquebusiers
blowing
their
matches
answered
him
furiously
the
proverb
says
in
paraguay
se
fia
de
mula
ni
mulata
the
honours
so
to
speak
being
thus
equally
divided
it
remained
for
one
side
or
the
other
to
negotiate
cardenas
knowing
himself
much
abler
in
negotiations
than
his
adversary
proposed
a
conference
in
which
he
bore
himself
so
skilfully
that
he
made
the
governor
consent
to
dismiss
his
indians
and
allow
him
six
days
to
make
his
preparations
for
the
road
this
settled
at
dead
of
night
he
set
out
for
the
capital
arrived
there
he
showed
himself
in
public
in
his
green
hat
having
upon
his
breast
a
little
box
of
glass
in
which
he
bore
the
host
a
band
of
priests
escorted
him
all
with
arms
concealed
beneath
their
cloaks
in
the
true
spirit
of
the
church
militant
the
bells
were
rung
and
every
effort
strained
to
raise
a
tumult
but
all
in
vain
he
had
to
throw
himself
for
refuge
into
the
convent
of
the
franciscans
at
once
he
set
about
to
fortify
the
place
to
stand
a
siege
in
several
places
he
constructed
embrasures
for
guns
and
pierced
the
walls
for
musketry
but
thinking
that
his
best
defence
lay
in
the
folly
of
the
people
as
public
men
always
have
done
and
do
he
sent
to
the
cathedral
for
a
statue
of
the
blessed
virgin
and
another
of
san
blas
and
placed
them
at
the
gate
then
remembering
that
calumny
was
a
most
serviceable
weapon
he
put
about
the
town
a
report
that
the
indians
from
the
missions
had
pillaged
yaguaron
and
that
they
even
then
were
marching
on
the
place
again
recurring
to
the
edict
of
charles
which
he
pretended
to
have
found
he
issued
a
proclamation
that
as
the
present
governor
was
excommunicated
and
therefore
could
not
govern
the
office
being
vacant
he
intended
to
nominate
another
in
his
stead
his
subsequent
behaviour
shows
most
clearly
that
he
wished
to
nominate
himself
again
both
sides
sent
off
a
relation
of
their
doings
to
the
high
court
of
charcas
don
bernardino
wrote
in
his
that
the
jesuits
had
offered
the
governor
thirty
thousand
crowns
and
placed
a
thousand
men
at
his
command
if
he
would
expel
the
bishop
from
the
country
under
the
belief
that
he
don
bernardino
knew
of
their
hidden
mines
in
the
mission
territory
his
witnesses
were
students
and
priests
and
one
of
these
proving
recalcitrant
the
bishop
had
him
heavily
chained
and
then
suspended
outside
the
convent
of
the
franciscans
this
drastic
treatment
had
the
desired
effect
as
torture
always
has
with
reasonable
men
and
the
poor
witness
signed
but
afterwards
protested
thus
giving
a
good
example
in
himself
of
the
truth
of
the
spanish
saying
and
pay
y
apelar
by
this
time
the
patience
and
of
the
governor
were
quite
exhausted
he
therefore
sent
to
the
bishop
to
say
a
ship
was
ready
to
take
him
down
the
river
and
at
the
same
time
reminded
him
of
his
promise
at
yaguaron
to
obey
the
order
of
the
viceroy
of
peru
he
sent
the
message
by
the
royal
notary
gomez
de
coyeso
who
accordingly
repaired
to
the
convent
of
san
francisco
at
the
door
a
priest
appeared
armed
with
a
javelin
who
three
times
tried
to
wound
the
notary
on
which
the
governor
stationed
a
band
of
fifty
soldiers
at
the
convent
gate
in
spite
of
the
presence
of
the
statues
of
the
blessed
virgin
and
san
blas
then
having
published
an
edict
that
the
bishop
was
deposed
he
proceeded
to
elect
another
in
his
stead
one
of
the
canons
don
cristobal
sanchez
who
had
governed
the
diocese
during
the
interregnum
before
the
advent
of
don
bernardino
still
lived
in
retirement
near
the
town
the
governor
approached
him
with
the
request
that
he
would
once
more
take
the
interim
charge
until
the
king
should
send
another
bishop
to
replace
cardenas
sanchez
consented
on
the
understanding
that
the
governor
would
guarantee
his
personal
safety
this
being
done
sanchez
was
taken
to
the
jesuit
college
as
the
securest
place
so
it
fell
out
that
everything
concurred
to
strengthen
the
hatred
of
the
bishop
to
the
jesuits
to
the
jesuit
college
came
the
governor
and
all
the
notables
and
having
taken
sanchez
in
procession
through
the
streets
they
placed
him
on
the
bishop
throne
in
the
cathedral
and
invested
him
with
all
the
power
that
he
had
held
before
the
coming
of
don
bernardino
cardenas
the
proclamation
set
forth
by
the
governor
alluded
to
the
informality
of
the
consecration
of
don
bernardino
and
to
his
actions
during
his
time
of
power
at
last
the
bishop
saw
that
he
must
go
so
after
launching
a
supreme
anathema
and
after
having
expressed
his
great
unwillingness
to
tarry
longer
in
a
city
where
half
the
population
had
incurred
the
censure
of
the
church
and
marked
with
a
cross
those
churches
where
he
permitted
mass
to
be
celebrated
he
went
on
board
the
ship
before
embarking
he
drew
a
silver
bell
from
underneath
his
cloak
and
to
the
sound
of
it
he
solemnly
proclaimed
the
town
accursed
the
bells
of
the
franciscan
convent
and
the
bishop
palace
according
to
his
orders
all
tolled
loudly
this
caused
so
much
confusion
that
in
order
to
appease
the
tumult
the
authorities
ordered
the
bells
of
all
the
churches
in
the
town
to
ring
entering
the
vessel
don
bernardino
sat
himself
upon
the
poop
on
a
low
stool
with
all
the
clergy
who
were
faithful
to
him
grouped
about
the
deck
with
him
he
had
the
sacred
wafer
in
a
glass
box
and
not
far
off
a
group
of
sailors
on
the
forecastle
lounged
about
smoking
and
drinking
whilst
they
played
at
cards
someone
reminded
him
it
was
not
fitting
that
god
body
should
thus
be
seen
so
near
to
sailors
and
therefore
the
bishop
according
to
the
custom
of
the
church
in
cases
of
accident
or
desecration
consumed
the
offended
wafer
and
peace
descended
on
the
ship
thus
in
he
took
his
first
departure
from
the
place
where
for
the
last
two
years
he
had
brought
certainly
rather
a
sword
than
peace
his
friends
assured
the
public
that
at
the
moment
he
stepped
on
board
the
ship
stars
were
seen
to
fall
from
heaven
towards
the
church
of
luke
and
passed
from
thence
to
the
episcopal
palace
and
disappeared
that
at
the
same
time
a
slight
shock
of
earthquake
had
been
experienced
that
stones
had
danced
about
and
several
hills
had
trembled
the
sun
quite
naturally
had
appeared
trouble
and
desolation
had
entered
every
heart
and
animals
had
prophesied
woe
and
destruction
predicting
ruin
and
misfortune
to
the
town
till
the
good
bishop
should
return
once
more
the
events
of
the
past
two
years
in
paraguay
had
not
been
favourable
to
the
conversion
of
the
indians
not
only
in
the
missions
where
the
neophytes
had
seen
themselves
obliged
to
furnish
troops
against
their
bishop
but
in
the
territory
of
paraguay
itself
the
indians
had
not
had
a
good
example
of
how
christians
carry
out
the
duties
of
their
faith
as
a
general
rule
the
indian
unlike
the
negro
cares
little
for
dogma
but
places
his
belief
entirely
in
good
works
perhaps
on
this
account
the
jesuits
also
believers
in
good
works
have
had
the
most
success
amongst
them
be
that
as
it
may
the
jesuits
after
the
departure
of
the
bishop
found
that
many
of
their
recent
converts
had
fallen
away
and
gone
back
to
the
woods
whilst
jesuits
in
paraguay
were
seeking
to
convert
the
indians
and
whilst
the
governor
no
doubt
was
thanking
his
stars
for
the
absence
of
his
rival
in
rome
the
question
of
the
bishop
consecration
filled
all
minds
from
may
to
october
of
the
same
year
no
less
than
four
congregations
of
the
propaganda
had
been
held
about
the
case
the
pope
himself
was
present
at
one
of
them
nothing
was
arrived
at
till
when
finally
the
consecration
was
declared
in
order
but
not
until
don
bernardino
was
appointed
to
another
see
just
about
this
time
a
rumour
was
set
on
foot
that
the
jesuits
had
discovered
mines
near
their
reductions
on
the
parana
these
rumours
were
always
set
about
when
there
was
nothing
else
by
means
of
which
to
attack
the
jesuits
an
indian
by
the
name
of
buenaventura
who
had
been
a
servant
in
a
convent
in
buenos
ayres
on
this
occasion
was
the
instrument
used
by
their
enemies
for
a
short
time
everyone
believed
him
and
excitement
was
intense
but
most
unluckily
buenaventura
happened
at
the
zenith
of
his
notoriety
to
run
away
with
a
married
woman
and
being
pursued
was
brought
to
buenos
ayres
and
then
in
public
incontinently
whipped
in
any
other
country
buenaventura
after
his
public
whipping
would
have
been
discredited
but
a
letter
arrived
from
the
bishop
of
paraguay
telling
the
governor
of
buenos
ayres
that
the
mines
really
existed
at
that
time
a
new
governor
one
don
jacinto
de
lara
had
just
arrived
being
new
to
america
and
its
ways
he
started
out
himself
to
try
the
question
and
with
fifty
soldiers
taking
buenaventura
as
his
guide
went
to
the
missions
as
might
have
been
expected
on
the
journey
buenaventura
disappeared
this
time
alone
fuite
lui
donna
beaucoup
penser
says
charlevoix
but
having
gone
so
far
the
governor
determined
to
try
the
question
thoroughly
father
diaz
tano
one
of
the
best
and
missionaries
who
ever
entered
paraguay
besought
the
governor
to
satisfy
himself
and
search
their
territory
for
gold
and
silver
and
requested
him
to
call
upon
the
bishop
for
confirmation
of
the
statements
he
had
made
this
he
did
and
then
accompanied
by
his
soldiers
began
his
search
he
gave
out
that
the
first
man
to
find
a
mine
should
be
at
once
promoted
to
be
captain
and
have
a
large
reward
after
several
days
march
and
having
found
no
mines
letters
were
brought
him
from
the
governor
of
paraguay
and
from
the
bishop
the
first
informed
him
that
he
had
heard
rumours
of
mines
but
nothing
certain
the
second
declined
to
specify
the
mines
which
thus
were
destined
to
remain
for
ever
so
to
speak
partibus
but
he
gave
advice
and
good
advice
is
better
than
any
mine
whether
of
silver
or
of
gold
he
told
the
governor
to
start
by
turning
out
the
jesuits
and
he
would
find
the
profits
of
their
expulsion
just
as
valuable
as
mines
whether
this
also
made
the
governor
pensive
i
do
not
know
but
luckily
the
jesuits
who
were
concerned
in
exposing
the
imposture
had
come
on
buenaventura
and
brought
him
ironed
to
the
governor
he
after
having
tried
to
make
him
confess
his
imposture
without
success
condemned
him
to
be
hung
the
jesuits
with
their
accustomed
humanity
or
ingenuity
begged
for
his
life
this
was
accorded
to
them
and
once
again
buenaventura
received
a
good
sound
whipping
for
his
pains
thus
ended
the
journey
of
don
jacinto
without
profit
to
himself
except
so
far
as
the
experience
gained
no
doubt
he
saw
and
marked
the
jesuit
towns
the
churches
built
of
massive
timber
or
of
stone
and
the
contented
air
of
indians
and
priests
which
always
struck
all
travellers
in
those
times
he
saw
the
countless
herds
of
cattle
the
cultivated
fields
enjoyed
no
doubt
for
the
first
time
since
arriving
in
south
america
the
sense
of
perfect
safety
at
that
time
to
be
experienced
alone
in
misiones
but
in
despite
of
his
exposure
of
the
imposture
the
rumour
as
to
the
existence
of
the
mines
never
died
out
and
lingers
even
in
spite
of
geological
research
in
paraguay
whilst
this
was
going
on
in
misiones
in
the
remote
and
district
of
the
itatines
in
the
north
of
paraguay
the
example
set
by
the
bishop
had
borne
its
fruit
the
indians
became
unmanageable
one
of
the
chiefs
broke
into
open
rebellion
and
wounded
a
jesuit
father
called
arenas
at
the
very
soon
the
general
corruption
of
manners
became
almost
universal
throughout
the
district
this
i
fancy
must
be
taken
to
mean
that
the
indians
reverted
to
polygamy
for
the
jesuits
always
had
trouble
in
this
matter
being
unable
to
persuade
the
indians
of
the
advantage
of
monogamy
but
most
fortuitously
just
as
the
general
corruption
gained
all
hearts
a
tiger
rushed
into
the
town
and
after
killing
fourteen
people
and
some
horses
disappeared
again
into
the
woods
the
jesuits
ever
ready
to
take
advantage
of
events
like
these
called
on
the
indians
to
see
in
the
visitation
of
the
tiger
the
wrath
of
heaven
and
to
leave
their
wicked
ways
the
indians
always
as
willing
to
submit
as
to
revolt
submitted
and
the
good
fathers
le
parti
de
faire
un
coup
qui
leur
as
charlevoix
relates
they
decoyed
the
chief
his
nephew
and
son
into
another
district
where
they
seized
and
shipped
them
off
two
hundred
leagues
to
a
remote
reduction
across
the
uruguay
the
spaniards
used
to
say
of
ferdinand
when
he
had
committed
any
great
barbarity
is
quite
a
king
mucho
rey
and
the
indians
of
the
itatines
esteemed
the
jesuits
for
their
in
the
same
manner
as
the
spaniards
their
king
his
usual
luck
attended
cardenas
in
his
exile
in
corrientes
this
town
formed
part
of
the
diocese
of
buenos
ayres
which
happened
to
be
vacant
at
the
time
he
therefore
took
upon
himself
to
act
just
as
he
had
acted
in
paraguay
appointed
officers
of
justice
held
ordinations
and
instituted
a
campaign
against
the
jesuits
of
the
town
whilst
he
was
thus
occupied
in
his
favourite
pastime
of
usurping
other
people
functions
two
citations
were
sent
him
to
appear
before
the
high
court
of
charcas
he
disregarded
them
and
sent
a
statement
of
his
case
by
the
hands
of
his
nephew
to
the
bishop
of
tucuman
in
the
letter
he
set
forth
all
his
complaints
against
the
governor
of
paraguay
calling
him
a
violator
of
the
church
a
heretic
and
generally
applying
to
him
all
those
terms
in
which
a
thwarted
churchman
usually
exhales
his
rage
mixed
up
with
this
was
a
detailed
accusation
of
the
jesuits
to
whose
account
he
laid
all
his
misfortunes
whilst
in
paraguay
lastly
he
called
upon
the
bishop
of
tucuman
to
summon
a
provincial
council
to
condemn
the
monstrous
heresies
which
he
attributed
to
the
jesuits
reminding
him
that
the
council
of
trent
had
recommended
the
holding
of
frequent
provincial
councils
and
stating
his
opinion
that
unless
a
council
were
called
at
once
the
bishop
would
incur
a
mortal
sin
the
answer
cardenas
received
from
tucuman
was
most
ironically
couched
in
the
best
style
that
his
friend
was
able
to
command
after
addressing
cardenas
as
illustrious
lordship
he
proceeded
to
demolish
all
his
statements
in
such
a
manner
as
to
argue
that
he
had
had
much
practice
with
refractory
priests
in
his
own
diocese
he
told
him
that
the
jesuits
were
the
only
order
in
paraguay
that
really
worked
amongst
the
indians
he
reminded
him
that
from
that
order
the
paul
francis
xavier
had
himself
issued
he
asked
him
whether
as
a
churchman
he
thought
the
yearly
sum
of
twelve
thousand
crowns
given
by
the
king
out
of
the
treasury
of
buenos
ayres
towards
the
jesuits
work
was
better
saved
or
that
the
thousands
of
indians
whom
the
jesuits
had
converted
should
be
lost
to
god
and
as
to
heresy
he
said
he
was
no
judge
leaving
such
matters
to
the
pope
but
that
no
one
accused
the
jesuits
of
corruption
in
their
morals
or
of
any
of
the
greater
crimes
to
which
the
great
fragility
of
human
nature
renders
us
liable
he
reminded
him
the
jesuits
had
made
no
accusation
on
their
part
but
always
spoke
of
him
with
moderation
and
respect
and
as
to
a
provincial
council
he
said
that
it
was
impossible
for
the
following
good
cause
the
bishop
of
was
too
infirm
to
travel
the
bishop
of
la
paz
was
lately
dead
and
the
see
still
vacant
the
bishop
of
buenos
ayres
only
just
arrived
and
too
much
occupied
to
leave
his
diocese
therefore
the
only
bishops
available
were
himself
and
cardenas
and
that
they
never
would
agree
misque
is
at
least
fifteen
hundred
miles
from
tucuman
he
remarked
is
it
that
your
illustrious
lordship
wishes
me
to
do
advise
a
bishop
has
only
given
me
the
charge
of
my
own
sheep
your
lordship
knows
as
well
as
i
do
how
a
bishop
should
comport
himself
he
finished
with
a
quotation
saying
that
a
bishop
state
was
not
to
lie
splendore
vestium
sed
morum
non
ad
iram
sed
ut
omnimodum
patientium
what
cardenas
replied
is
not
set
down
in
any
history
which
has
come
under
my
observation
but
what
he
must
have
thought
is
easy
to
divine
the
governor
of
paraguay
not
content
with
having
put
his
case
before
the
supreme
court
of
charcas
sent
also
to
the
council
general
of
the
indies
in
seville
detailing
all
the
vagaries
of
the
bishop
the
jesuits
also
empowered
an
officer
to
represent
them
there
during
these
preparations
and
whilst
everyone
was
off
his
guard
the
guaycurus
endeavoured
to
surprise
the
capital
and
would
have
done
so
had
not
some
regiments
of
guaranis
arrived
in
time
from
the
mission
territory
this
should
have
been
an
to
those
who
always
tried
to
show
the
jesuits
in
the
light
of
enemies
to
the
authority
of
the
king
of
spain
nothing
however
proved
of
the
least
avail
and
though
on
several
occasions
the
spanish
power
in
paraguay
was
only
saved
by
the
exertions
of
the
jesuits
and
their
indians
the
calumnies
of
cardenas
had
taken
too
deep
root
to
be
dispelled
meanwhile
in
corrientes
cardenas
schemed
night
and
day
to
return
to
paraguay
in
his
own
city
of
la
plata
naturally
he
had
some
friends
and
these
did
all
they
could
to
get
him
reinstated
in
spite
of
all
their
efforts
an
order
came
from
charcas
for
him
to
leave
the
city
under
pain
of
banishment
anyone
but
cardenas
would
have
been
disconcerted
he
though
pretended
as
in
the
order
he
was
still
styled
bishop
of
paraguay
that
before
leaving
for
charcas
to
present
himself
before
the
court
he
had
to
go
to
asuncion
to
name
a
and
towards
the
end
of
he
embarked
upon
the
river
for
paraguay
lo
hagan
salir
de
nuestros
reynos
y
como
ageno
y
por
importar
assi
para
la
quietud
de
aquellas
provincias
y
al
servicio
de
su
majestad
the
governor
was
on
the
alert
and
sent
a
vessel
with
orders
to
turn
him
back
which
order
was
carried
out
in
spite
of
his
remonstrances
and
he
returned
to
corrientes
in
a
miserable
state
then
came
another
citation
to
appear
at
charcas
and
an
intimation
that
he
was
appointed
bishop
of
popayan
as
popayan
in
new
granada
was
at
least
three
thousand
miles
from
asuncion
his
joy
at
the
appointment
must
have
been
extreme
his
fortunes
now
seemed
desperate
as
he
said
himself
in
a
letter
to
the
king
an
advanced
age
he
could
not
undertake
so
great
a
journey
and
on
every
side
his
enemies
seemed
to
have
got
the
upper
hand
in
a
change
came
over
everything
don
gregorio
hinestrosa
was
removed
from
paraguay
and
a
new
governor
don
diego
escobar
de
osorio
appointed
in
his
place
immediately
the
news
reached
cardenas
he
set
out
for
paraguay
arriving
at
asuncion
his
friends
all
met
him
and
took
him
in
procession
to
the
cathedral
his
first
thought
was
to
renew
his
persecution
of
the
jesuits
most
unfortunately
for
them
don
juan
de
palafox
bishop
of
puebla
de
los
angeles
in
mexico
who
had
himself
in
mexico
had
many
quarrels
with
the
jesuits
wrote
begging
cardenas
and
all
the
bishops
of
south
america
to
join
against
them
this
palafox
was
afterwards
beatified
and
even
in
his
lifetime
enjoyed
the
reputation
of
a
saint
so
that
his
letter
greatly
strengthened
cardenas
notwithstanding
this
palafox
in
subsequent
works
of
his
during
the
time
that
he
was
bishop
of
osma
in
spain
said
many
things
in
praise
of
the
work
done
by
the
jesuits
in
paraguay
the
new
governor
himself
a
member
of
the
supreme
court
of
charcas
had
never
been
before
in
paraguay
and
therefore
resolved
to
treat
the
bishop
as
don
gregorio
had
done
with
every
respect
due
to
his
station
the
bishop
wanted
nothing
better
and
saw
at
once
he
had
another
fool
to
deal
with
therefore
he
made
no
secret
of
his
intention
of
not
complying
with
the
citation
of
the
court
at
charcas
and
set
himself
at
once
to
preach
against
the
jesuits
and
stir
up
popular
resentment
against
them
unluckily
proof
was
wanting
of
the
crimes
he
alleged
they
had
committed
so
he
resorted
to
the
device
of
getting
a
petition
signed
by
all
and
sundry
asking
for
the
expulsion
of
the
order
from
paraguay
like
all
petitions
it
was
largely
signed
by
women
and
by
children
and
by
those
who
had
never
thought
before
about
the
matter
but
liked
the
opportunity
to
write
their
names
after
the
names
of
others
as
sheep
go
through
a
gap
or
members
give
their
votes
out
of
mere
sympathy
in
the
high
court
of
parliament
this
device
having
taken
too
much
time
blank
documents
were
passed
about
for
all
to
write
upon
whatever
they
imagined
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
jesuits
by
an
untoward
chance
a
bundle
of
these
sent
to
the
agent
of
the
bishop
in
spain
was
taken
on
the
voyage
by
an
english
corsair
the
worthy
pirate
no
doubt
a
protestant
was
if
we
can
believe
the
jesuits
extremely
scandalized
at
the
bad
faith
of
those
who
used
such
means
of
wreaking
their
malevolence
so
all
seemed
once
again
to
smile
upon
don
bernardino
who
no
doubt
resumed
his
flagellations
his
midnight
services
and
his
saying
of
two
masses
and
once
again
became
the
idol
of
the
people
of
asuncion
but
in
the
north
in
the
wild
district
of
caaguayu
hard
by
the
mountains
of
mbaracaya
close
to
the
great
the
jesuits
had
formed
two
towns
amongst
the
indians
these
two
towns
were
destined
to
be
the
outposts
of
the
country
against
the
incursions
of
the
wild
indians
from
the
chaco
a
is
a
forest
chiefly
composed
of
the
paraguayensis
from
the
leaves
of
which
the
mate
or
tea
is
made
the
bishop
prevailed
upon
the
governor
to
let
him
turn
out
the
jesuits
and
replace
them
by
priests
of
another
order
this
being
done
the
indians
all
deserted
leaving
the
district
quite
uninhabited
the
court
at
charcas
hearing
of
this
folly
sent
an
order
to
the
governor
to
send
the
jesuits
back
a
year
was
passed
in
ceaseless
searching
of
the
woods
and
deserts
for
the
indians
but
only
half
of
the
population
could
ever
be
persuaded
to
return
and
father
mansilla
the
died
of
the
hardships
that
he
underwent
from
that
date
down
to
the
time
of
francia
circa
the
district
remained
a
desert
francia
used
it
as
a
penal
settlement
and
save
for
a
few
wild
wandering
indians
known
as
caaguas
and
a
sparse
population
of
it
still
remains
almost
unpopulated
meanwhile
the
general
indignation
against
the
jesuits
seemed
to
infect
all
classes
of
the
population
certainly
the
citizens
of
asuncion
had
good
and
sufficient
causes
of
complaint
against
the
jesuits
on
several
occasions
the
efforts
of
the
jesuits
and
their
indians
alone
had
saved
the
capital
from
the
wild
indians
and
benefits
are
hard
to
bear
if
only
from
their
rarity
popular
hatred
to
the
full
as
idiotic
as
is
popular
applause
fell
chiefly
upon
father
diaz
tano
he
who
had
saved
ten
thousand
indians
for
the
king
of
spain
in
his
celebrated
retreat
before
the
mamelucos
down
the
parana
and
he
was
frequently
insulted
in
the
streets
father
antonio
manquiano
a
quiet
and
learned
man
was
almost
murdered
in
open
day
by
a
furious
fanatic
who
fell
upon
him
with
the
openly
expressed
intent
eat
his
heart
this
was
the
moment
cardenas
pitched
on
to
declare
the
entire
order
of
the
jesuits
excommunicated
as
he
had
been
a
year
away
from
the
scene
of
his
former
exploits
people
were
not
so
used
to
excommunications
and
therefore
took
them
seriously
at
this
eventful
juncture
the
governor
don
diego
died
so
suddenly
that
suspicions
of
his
having
been
poisoned
were
aroused
scarce
was
he
dead
than
all
the
population
assembled
at
the
palace
to
elect
an
interim
successor
this
was
a
most
important
thing
as
to
communicate
with
spain
took
at
the
very
shortest
time
about
eight
months
by
acclamation
the
choice
fell
on
the
bishop
who
thus
found
himself
head
of
the
spiritual
and
the
temporal
power
at
once
the
election
was
absolutely
illegal
as
the
spanish
law
provided
that
if
a
governor
of
paraguay
should
chance
to
die
the
nomination
of
an
interim
successor
should
rest
first
with
the
viceroy
of
peru
and
failing
him
with
the
high
court
of
charcas
cardenas
based
his
election
on
the
pretended
edict
of
the
emperor
charles
but
if
he
had
a
copy
of
the
edict
never
produced
it
as
usual
men
daring
not
and
wise
men
caring
not
but
only
fools
and
schemers
taking
part
in
the
election
no
serious
opposition
to
his
usurpation
was
encountered
cardenas
never
doubted
for
a
moment
that
the
function
of
a
governor
was
to
govern
and
he
began
at
once
to
do
so
with
a
will
xarque
a
spanish
writer
gives
the
following
curious
description
of
how

to

on

expel

my
brethren
that
jesus

all
being

answered
as
one
man
that
such
was
their
belief
in
the
same
way
as
at
a
scientific
lecture
when
the
lecturer
holds
up
some
substance
and
says
all
know
well
that
calcium

hearers
nod
assent
like
sheep
being
afraid
to
contradict
so
glib
a
statement
from
so
eminent
a
man
then
said
cardenas
as
firmly
that
i
have
an
order
from
the
king
to
expel
the
jesuits
the
people
all
believed
and
cardenas
forgot
to
tell
them
that
by
the
expulsion
of
the
jesuits
twenty
thousand
indians
would
pass
into
his
power
whom
he
could
then
distribute
amongst
his
friends
as
slaves
as
he
proposed
to
divide
the
indians
of
the
missions
amongst
the
paraguayan
notables
to
win
them
to
his
side
being
at
the
head
of
everything
in
asuncion
cardenas
no
longer
hesitated
but
ordered
an
officer
don
juan
de
vallejo
villasanti
with
a
troop
of
soldiers
to
march
to
the
college
of
the
jesuits
this
he
did
and
finding
the
gates
all
barred
he
burst
them
open
and
entering
the
college
signified
to
the
rector
an
order
from
the
governor
duly
countersigned
by
the
bishop
to
leave
the
city
with
all
his
priests
and
to
evacuate
all
the
missions
on
the
parana
the
rector
answered
that
the
jesuits
had
a
permission
from
philip
renewed
by
his
successors
to
found
a
college
and
father
tano
exhibited
the
documents
villasanti
who
had
but
little
love
for
documents
snatched
the
parchments
from
his
hand
and
the
soldiers
forced
the
jesuits
in
a
body
to
the
port
like
sheep
there
they
were
tied
and
thrown
into
canoes
almost
without
provisions
and
sent
off
down
the
river
to
corrientes
the
certain
haven
of
the
party
in
paraguay
which
has
got
the
worst
of
an
election
or
a
revolution
and
wishes
to
gain
time
arrived
in
corrientes
don
manuel
cabral
a
pious
officer
received
them
in
his
house
and
curiously
enough
the
population
welcomed
the
jesuits
with
enthusiasm
and
pressed
them
earnestly
to
build
a
college
in
the
town
their
college
at
asuncion
was
treated
like
a
town
taken
by
storm
pulpit
and
font
confessionals
and
doors
all
were
torn
down
and
burnt
and
with
a
view
of
justifying
what
was
done
the
bishop
partisans
spread
a
report
that
as
the
jesuits
were
heretics
their
temple
was
unclean
the
population
more
artistic
in
its
instincts
than
the
bishop
refused
to
allow
the
altar
which
had
been
brought
from
spain
to
be
destroyed
besides
the
altar
there
were
also
statues
of
san
ignacio
and
san
francisco
xavier
these
the
bishop
wished
to
turn
into
peter
and
paul
with
this
design
he
gave
them
to
an
indian
carpenter
to
work
upon
the
poor
man
did
his
best
but
only
managed
to
turn
out
two
monstrous
blocks
which
looked
like
nothing
human
a
statue
of
the
blessed
virgin
which
had
the
eyes
turned
up
to
heaven
the
bishop
wished
to
alter
and
replace
the
head
by
another
with
the
eyes
turned
down
to
earth
as
being
more
befitting
to
the
statue
sex
the
people
less
mad
or
superstitious
than
the
bishop
refused
to
allow
it
and
the
image
too
was
placed
in
the
cathedral
in
the
expulsion
of
an
order
so
powerful
as
were
the
jesuits
caused
some
commotion
through
the
world
at
large
miracles
happened
opportunely
to
strengthen
waning
faith
a
fire
placed
round
their
church
though
it
destroyed
refused
to
blacken
and
ropes
fixed
to
the
tower
of
the
church
although
attached
to
windlasses
refused
to
pull
it
down
so
that
the
tower
and
church
though
gutted
still
remained
almost
intact
and
on
the
jesuits
return
were
easily
repaired
and
served
as
a
monument
of
victory
uneasy
lies
the
head
that
wears
a
mitre
as
poor
cardenas
found
out
his
popularity
suffered
some
decrease
by
the
lack
of
treasure
found
in
the
jesuits
college
for
he
had
always
dangled
millions
in
prospective
before
the
people
eyes
to
engage
them
on
his
side
and
most
unluckily
he
had
no
millions
to
bestow
so
to
make
all
things
right
he
sent
fray
diego
to
madrid
to
represent
his
interests
this
villalon
has
left
some
curious
memoirs
in
the
case
which
he
submitted
to
the
council
of
the
indies
which
sat
in
seville
the
jesuits
upon
their
side
were
not
inactive
by
virtue
of
a
brief
of
gregory
xiii
they
had
the
privilege
of
appointing
an
official
called
a
judge
conservator
in
cases
where
their
honour
or
their
possessions
were
attacked
therefore
father
alfonso
de
ojeda
was
sent
to
charcas
to
arrange
about
the
case
at
charcas
they
found
that
cardenas
had
been
before
them
and
had
instituted
proceedings
against
their
order
in
the
high
court
father
pedro
nolasco
superior
of
the
order
of
mercy
was
appointed
judge
conservator
he
at
once
summoned
the
bishop
to
appear
before
him
and
arranged
to
try
the
case
and
hear
the
evidence
cardenas
having
refused
to
appear
sentence
went
by
default
against
him
the
high
court
being
convinced
that
the
pretended
edict
of
the
emperor
charles
did
not
exist
appointed
don
andres
garabito
de
leon
to
be
interim
of
paraguay
and
gave
him
power
if
necessary
to
restore
order
by
force
of
arms
the
court
then
issued
a
decree
summoning
cardenas
to
appear
at
once
at
charcas
and
give
his
reasons
why
he
had
had
himself
made
governor
and
had
expulsed
the
jesuits
from
paraguay
it
then
communicated
with
the
marquis
of
mancera
viceroy
of
peru
who
quite
concurred
in
its
decision
as
to
cardenas
apparently
upon
the
principle
which
prevails
amongst
mohammedans
of
always
appointing
first
an
officer
and
then
a
caliph
to
that
officer
to
do
the
work
the
high
court
of
charcas
also
appointed
a
commander
to
proceed
to
paraguay
pending
the
time
that
don
andres
should
feel
inclined
to
start
himself
as
the
caliph
name
was
sebastian
de
leon
it
is
not
improbable
that
he
was
a
relation
of
the
man
don
sebastian
de
leon
seems
to
have
been
in
paraguay
already
for
both
charlevoix
and
xarque
agree
that
he
and
his
brothers
after
the
expulsion
of
the
jesuits
by
cardenas
had
retired
to
an
estate
some
distance
from
asuncion
at
the
estate
the
news
of
his
appointment
reached
him
and
must
have
placed
him
in
a
most
difficult
position
as
to
what
to
do
on
several
occasions
in
the
various
rebellions
which
occurred
in
south
america
during
the
spanish
rule
men
were
appointed
to
quell
rebellions
pacify
countries
and
restore
order
and
all
without
an
army
or
any
forces
being
placed
at
their
command
this
was
the
case
with
the
celebrated
la
gasca
who
was
sent
from
spain
to
put
down
the
rebellion
of
gonzalo
pizarro
and
succeeded
in
so
doing
though
he
left
spain
without
a
single
soldier
in
his
train
in
this
connection
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
none
of
the
rebellions
in
spanish
america
from
the
days
of
charles
i
the
emperor
charles
to
those
of
charles
iii
were
for
the
object
of
separation
from
the
metropolis
but
merely
risings
against
governors
sent
out
from
spain
it
seems
that
both
in
peru
and
paraguay
the
very
name
of
the
imperial
power
was
able
to
draw
hundreds
of
men
to
the
standard
of
whatever
officer
held
a
commission
from
madrid
such
as
that
held
by
garabito
de
leon
or
by
la
gasca
on
the
parana
at
first
don
sebastian
did
not
show
himself
in
asuncion
but
sent
out
messengers
on
every
side
to
summon
soldiers
requisition
horses
and
collect
provisions
he
also
sent
to
corrientes
to
tell
the
jesuits
he
was
ready
to
reinstate
them
in
their
possessions
don
bernardino
meanwhile
was
preparing
for
the
great
adventure
of
his
life
he
seems
to
have
believed
most
firmly
that
no
power
on
earth
had
any
right
to
remove
him
from
the
governorship
of
paraguay
in
a
letter
which
he
addressed
to
don
juan
romero
de
la
he
says
he
is
on
the
point
of
distinguishing
himself
by
heroic
exploits
and
great
victories
that
he
had
on
his
side
justice
and
force
a
most
uncommon
combination
that
the
entire
capital
was
favourable
to
him
and
that
he
was
resolved
neither
to
readmit
the
jesuits
nor
to
recognise
don
sebastian
de
leon
as
governor
charlevoix
book
asuncion
was
once
again
convulsed
and
all
was
preparation
for
the
holy
war
the
bishop
had
given
out
that
angels
were
to
help
him
and
this
so
reassured
his
soldiers
that
they
provided
themselves
with
cords
to
bind
the
indians
in
the
army
of
don
sebastian
leon
thinking
they
would
fall
an
easy
prey
to
them
this
matter
of
the
cords
explains
perhaps
why
the
population
of
asuncion
was
almost
unanimous
in
favour
of
the
bishop
in
the
army
of
don
sebastian
as
well
as
the
militia
of
the
province
marched
three
thousand
indians
from
the
jesuit
reductions
on
the
parana
the
spaniards
of
the
capital
were
all
determined
not
to
kill
any
of
them
but
keep
them
alive
for
slaves
and
hence
the
cords
with
which
they
armed
themselves
the
sacred
generalissimo
led
out
his
army
from
asuncion
in
person
celebrating
mass
himself
and
then
heading
his
troops
like
many
another
spanish
ecclesiastic
has
done
before
and
after
him
and
continued
doing
even
to
the
latest
carlist
war
the
armies
met
not
far
from
luque
in
a
little
plain
known
as
the
campo
grande
an
open
plain
with
sandy
soil
which
gave
the
horses
a
good
footing
with
several
little
stagnant
pools
in
the
centre
where
the
wounded
men
could
drink
and
wash
their
wounds
with
a
most
convenient
forest
on
all
sides
for
the
deserters
and
the
cowards
to
hide
in
made
a
good
battlefield
the
village
of
luque
grouped
round
its
church
and
with
a
little
plaza
in
the
middle
in
which
sat
paraguayan
women
selling
mandioca
chipa
and
rapadura
with
sacks
of
maize
and
of
mani
stood
on
the
summit
of
a
little
hill
upon
the
plain
the
earth
is
red
and
looks
as
if
a
battle
had
been
fought
upon
it
and
much
blood
spilt
in
all
directions
run
little
paths
worn
deep
by
the
feet
of
mules
and
horses
and
in
which
the
rider
has
to
lift
his
feet
as
if
he
were
going
through
a
stream
to
asuncion
there
leads
one
of
the
roads
planted
with

and
trees
constructed

side
hardly
a
soldier
but
thought
himself
an
emissary
of
god
or
doubted
of
the
victory
for
a
moment
in
his
heart
angels
themselves
had
promised
victory
to
their
leader
who
to
make
all
things
safe
had
issued
a
proclamation
punishing
surrender
with
the
pain
of
death
so
they
stood
quietly
in
array
of
battle
waiting
to
be
attacked
upon
his
side
don
sebastian
leon
seeing
the
attitude
of
the
enemy
immediately
ordered
an
advance
and
charged
himself
with
all
his
cavalry
upon
the
bishop
men
they
with
the
firmness
that
fanatics
so
often
show
stood
firmly
in
their
ranks
thinking
themselves
invulnerable
their
valour
proved
but
momentary
for
at
the
second
charge
they
broke
their
ranks
and
fled
flight
turned
to
rout
and
don
sebastian
having
commanded
that
they
should
not
be
pursued
they
still
fled
on
no

pursuing
them
the
governor
then
entered
the
capital
without
resistance
on
the
plaza
he
stopped
and
having
gathered
up
the
wounded
without
respect
of
party
he
sent
them
to
the
hospital
then
having
seen
to
the
safety
of
the
town
he
rode
to
the
cathedral
to
give
thanks
to
god
for
having
preserved
him
from
the
dangers
of
the
fight
dressed
in
his
robes
and
seated
on
his
throne
was
cardenas
don
sebastian
entered
the
church
dismounted
and
kissed
his
hand
respectfully
like
a
true
spaniard
and
asked
him
ceremoniously
to
deign
to
give
him
the
baton
of
the
civil
power
cardenas
answered
not
a
word
but
handed
him
the
baton
and
then
retired
accompanied
by
all
his
priests
the
victory
did
not
terminate
the
work
of
don
sebastian
after
a
reasonable
interval
and
before
witnesses
he
cited
the
bishop
to
appear
before
the
court
of
charcas
the
bishop
promised
to
obey
thinking
he
had
another
don
gregorio
hinostrosa
to
deal
with
but
quite
determined
never
to
comply
acting
according
to
the
custom
of
governors
in
south
america
who
when
an
order
reached
them
from
madrid
either
absurd
or
quite
impossible
to
execute
solemnly
answered
obey
but
i
do
not
comply
saving
by
the
phrase
the
honour
of
their
sovereigns
and
themselves
upon
their
side
the
jesuits
pressed
the
judge
conservator
father
nolasco
to
issue
his
sentence
and
free
them
from
the
charges
under
which
they
lay
this
he
did
and
gave
as
his
opinion
they
were
quite
innocent
of
all
that
cardenas
had
laid
to
their
account
pero
no
cumplo
as
in
a
palace
things
go
slow
in
spain
and
it
was
not
till
that
a
royal
decision
confirmed
the
judgment
of
nolasco
and
freed
the
jesuits
from
all
the
charges
raised
against
them
de

cardenas
deprived
of
his
usurped
authority
and
the
jesuits
reinstated
the
temporary
commission
of
sebastian
leon
was
at
an
end
therefore
he
retired
again
to
plant
his
mandioca
under
his
own
yet
feeling
ran
so
high
that
he
was
hardly
safe
from
the
vengeance
of
the
partisans
of
cardenas
so
that
he
found
himself
once
more
obliged
to
summon
the
militia
of
the
province
and
lead
them
to
a
perfunctory
campaign
against
the
payaguas
these
indians
the
earlier
historians
of
the
conquest
barco
de
la
centenera
and
rui
diaz
de
guzman
describe
as
almost
living
in
canoes
and
dashing
out
on
any
passing
spanish
vessel
that
they
thought
weak
enough
the
jesuits
montoya
and
dobrizhoffer
tell
us
that
they
went
naked
painted
in
many
colours
with
a
hawk
or
parrot
wing
passed
through
the
cartilage
of
their
left
ear
and
that
they
were
of
all
the
indians
of
paraguay
the
most
indomitable
a
few
when
i
knew
paraguay
some
twenty
years
ago
hung
round
asuncion
squalid
and
miserable
passing
their
time
in
fishing
in
canoes
and
as
attached
to
their
own
mode
of
life
as
when
the
first
discoverers
called
them
pirates
and
the
pestilent
of
all
the
indians
on
the

paraguay
the
payaguas
chastised
don
sebastian
upon
one
pretext
or
another
did
not
disband
his
troops
keeping
them
always
by
him
and
thus
making
the
position
of
the
bishop
quite
untenable
till
by
degrees
his
followers
fell
away
and
left
him
almost
deserted
and
his
party
all
dissolved
seeing
the
game
was
up
the
bishop
after
having
named
one
don
adrian
cornejo
as
his
suffragan
took
his
departure
for
charcas
to
appear
before
the
court
for
eight
tumultuous
years
he
had
kept
his
bishopric
in
a
perpetual
turmoil
having
been
the
evil
genius
of
the
land
what
sort
of
man
he
really
was
is
hard
to
judge
for
xarque
villalon
charlevoix
and
dean
funes
who
chronicle
his
doings
were
all
on
one
side
or
the
other
partisans
the
jesuits
condemn
him
as
a
spoliator
the
franciscans
hold
him
up
as
one
who
fought
throughout
his
life
for
the
honour
of
the
founder
of
their
rule
tracts
books
and
pamphlets
for
and
against
him
have
been
written
in
numbers
and
in
the
history
of
the
times
in
paraguay
his
name
bulks
large
one
thing
is
certain
that
the
indians
loved
and
revered
him
and
followed
him
up
to
the
end
even
in
charcas
where
he
lived
for
years
upon
a
pension
of
two
thousand
crowns
allowed
him
by
the
king
whilst
his
case
dragged
its
weary
course
to
rome
madrid
back
to
peru
and
then
to
rome
again
the
indians
when
he
appeared
in
public
greeted
him
with
flowers
he
may
have
been
a
saint
so
many
men
are
saints
and
the
world
knows
them
not
he
may
have
been
a
schemer
but
he
made
nothing
by
his
schemes
except
the
barren
honour
of
his
consecration
to
the
see
of
paraguay
a
preacher
certainly
he
was
able
and
willing
to
draw
crowds
after
the
fashion
of
all
those
who
have
the
gift
of
words
dean
funes

no

thinking
all
those
who
differed
from
him
were
accursed
of

a
strenuous
member
of
the
church
militant
on

he
was
at
least
a
personality
and
those
who
read
the
history
of
his
time
must
reckon
with
and
take
sides
for
or
against
him
after
the
fashion
of
the
men
with
whom
he
passed
his
life
who
to
a
man
revered
him
as
a
saint
or
looked
upon
him
as
a
devil
sent
to
plague
mankind
arrived
in
charcas
he
soon
fell
on
evil
times
although
at
first
he
made
some
partisans
still
looking
back
to
paraguay
he
passed
his
time
in
drawing
out
petitions
to
the
king
then
one
by
one
all
his
friends
fell
from
him
except
some
faithful
indians
who
considered
him
a
saint
his
dreams
of
saintship
were
not
fulfilled
for
his
name
never
figured
in
the
calendar
years
did
not
tame
nor
yet
did
hope
ever

resuscitate

that

therefore
the
charges
against

first
started
are

warp
our
judgment
as
to
the
doings
of

in
the
missions

even
until
but
neither
calumny
nor
the

nor

the
jealousy
of
the
spanish

in

deterred
the

natural
that

it
must
have
been
annoying
to
a
society
composed
as
were
the
greater
portion
of
the
spanish
settlements
in

of
adventurers
who
treated
the
indians
as
brute
beasts
to
see
a
preserve
of
indians
separated
from

by
no

barrier

and
of
all
those
who
have
ever
visited
the
missions
of

it
was
from
those
mountains
that
the
jesuits
procured
the

reductions

and
by

from
which
the
jesuits
derived
a
handsome
revenue
after
the
expulsion
of
the
order
all
the
in

was
procured
till
a
few
years
ago
from

in
the
north
of

in
which
the

grew

it
was
by
the
bull
of
paul

given
at
the
demand
of
two
monks
fray
domingo
de
betanzos
and
fray
domingo

that
the
indians
were
first
considered

a

opponent
of

says
that
european
offenders
and
recalcitrant
indians
in
the
missions
were
sent
as
a
last
resource
to
the
spanish
settlements
this
is
not
astonishing
when
we
remember
the
curious
letter
of
don
pedro
faxardo
bishop
of
buenos
ayres
preserved
by
charlevoix
written
in
to
the
king
of
spain
in
which
he
says
he
thinks
not
a
mortal
crime
is
committed
in
the
missions
in
a
year
he
adds
that
the
jesuits
were
so
rich
why
are
their
colleges
so
poor
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
of
the
thirty
jesuit
missions
only
eight
were
in
paraguay
the
rest
were
in
what
is
brazil
and
the
argentine
provinces
of
entre
rios
corrientes
and
misiones
in
this
rich
territory
the
jesuits
when
after
infinite
trouble
they
had
united
a
quantity
of
indians
formed
them
into
townships
almost
all
of
which
were
built
upon
one
plan
in
paraguay
itself
only
some
three
or
four
remain
but
they
remain
so
well
preserved
that
by
the
help
of
contemporary
accounts
it
is
easy
to
reconstruct
almost
exactly
what
the
missions
must
have
been
like
during
the
jesuits
rule
sometimes
when
they
had
been
assembled
they
all
deserted
suddenly
as
did
the
tobatines
who
in
suddenly
left
the
reduction
of
santa
fe
and
for
eleven
years
were
lost
in
the
forests
till
father
yegros
found
them
and
as
they
would
not
return
established
himself
amongst
them

were
beyond
all
description
splendid
taking
into
consideration
the
remoteness
of
the
jesuit
towns
from
the
outside
world
frequently
as
for
instance
in
the
mission
of
los
apostoles
the
churches
had
three
aisles
and
were
adorned
with
lofty
towers
rich
altars
and
statuary
brought
at
great
expense
from
italy
and
spain
though
the
churches
were
often
built
of
stone
it
was
not
usual
for
the
houses
of
the
indians
to
be
so
built
but
in
situations
where
stone
was
plentiful
as
at
the
mission
of
san
borja
the
houses
of
the
jesuits
were
of
masonry
with
verandas
held
up
by
columns
and
with
staircases
with
balustrades
of
sculptured
stone
the
ordinary
of
the

house
was
that
of
the
spanish
moorish
dwelling
so
like
in
all
its
details
to
a
roman
house
at
pompeii
or
at
herculaneum
built
round
a
square
courtyard
with
a
fountain
in
the
middle
the
jesuits
house
formed
but
a
portion
of
a
sort
of
inner
town
which
was
surrounded
by
a
wall
in
which
a
gate
closed
by
a
porter
lodge
communicated
with
the
outside
world
within
the
wall
was
situated

although
it
had
an
entrance
to
the

the
rooms
of

a
garden
a

the

and

and
the
provisions
necessary
for
life
in

remote
and
often
dangerous
place
in

case
the
houses
were
of

the

was

the
greatest
difficulty
which
the
jesuits
had
to
face
was
the
natural
indolence
of
their
neophytes
quite
unaccustomed
as
they
were
to
regular
work
of
any
kind
the
ordinary
european
system
as
practised
in
the
spanish
settlements
promptly
reduced
them
to
despair
and
often
killed
them
off
in
hundreds
therefore
the
jesuits
instituted
the
system
of
agriculture
and
of
public
works
with
which
their
name
will
be
associated
for
ever
in
america
in
their
extensive
missions
in
the
provinces
of
chiquitos
and
moxos
they
pursued
the
same
system
as
they
were
much
more
isolated
in
those
provinces
than
in
paraguay
and
consequently
much
less
interfered
with
it
was
there
that
their
peculiar
system
most
flourished
after
the
expulsion
of
the
jesuits
from
america
in
the
spaniards
in
alta
peru
and
subsequently
the
bolivians
had
the
sense
to
follow
the
jesuit
plan
in
its
entirety
whereas
bucareli
the
viceroy
of
buenos
ayres
entirely
changed
the
jesuits
rule
in
paraguay
the
consequence
was
that
in
bolivia
the
indians
instead
of
dispersing
as
they
did
in
paraguay
remained
in
the
missions

ten
missions
in

and

in
moxos
at
the
present
time
the
franciscans
have
some
small
establishments
in
bolivia
the
celebrated
francia
dictator
of
paraguay
used
to
refer
to
the
jesuits
as
rogues
and
as
he
certainly
himself
was
versed
in
every
phase
of
cunningness
perhaps
his
estimate
to
some
extent
at
least
was
just
a
rogue
in
politics
is
but
a
man
who
disagrees
with
you
but
still
it
wanted
no
little
knowledge
of
mankind
to
present
a
daily
task
to
men
unversed
in
any
kind
of
labour
as
of
the
nature
of
a
pleasure
in
itself
the
difficulty
was
enormous
as
the
indians
seemed
never
to
have
come
under
the
primeval
curse
but
passed
their
lives
in
wandering
about
occasionally
cultivating
just
sufficient
for
their
needs
whether
a
missionary
jesuit
or
jansenist
protestant
catholic
or
mohammedan
does
well
in
forcing
his
own
mode
of
life
and
faith
on
those
who
live
a
happier
freer
life
than
any
his
instructor
can
hold
out
to
them
is
a
moot
point
only
the
future
can
resolve
the
question
and
judge
of
what
we
do
no
doubt
with
good
intentions
but
with

born

our
much
of
the
misery
of
the
world
has
been
brought
about
with
good
intentions
but
of
the
jesuits
at
least
it
can
be
said
that
what
they
did
in
paraguay
did
not
spread
death
and
extinction
to
the
tribes
with
whom
they
dealt
so
to
the
task
of
agriculture
the
jesuits
marshalled
their
neophytes
to
the
sound
of
music
and
in
procession
to
the
fields
with
a
saint
borne
high
aloft
the
community
each
day
at
sunrise
took
its
way
along
the
paths
at
stated
intervals
were
shrines
of
saints
and
before
each
of
them
they
prayed
and
between
each
shrine
sang
hymns
as
the
procession
advanced
it
became
gradually
smaller
as
groups
of
indians
dropped
off
to
work
the
various
fields
and
finally
the
priest
and
acolyte
with
the
musicians
returned
alone
at
before
eating
they
all
united
and
sang
hymns
and
then
after
their
meal
and
siesta
returned
to
work
till
sundown
when
the
procession
again
and
the
labourers
singing
returned
to
their
abodes
a
pleasing
and
arcadian
style
of
tillage
and
different
from
the
system
of
the
labourer
in
more
northern
climes
but
even
then
the
hymnal
day
was
not
concluded
for
after
a
brief
rest
they
all
repaired
to
church
to
sing
the
and
then
to
sup
and
bed
on
rainy
days
they
worked
at
other
industries
in
the
same
manner
only
they
sang
their
hymns
in
church
instead
of
in
the
fields
the
system
was
so
different
to
that
under
which
the
indians
endured
their
lives
in
the
and
the
of
the
spanish
settlements
that
the
fact
alone
is
sufficient
to

imagine
a

set
close
to
the

of

in
which
thousands
of
kaffirs
passed
a
life
analogous
to
that
passed
by
the
indians
of
the
missions
cared
for
and
fed
by
the
community
looked
after
in
every
smallest
particular
of
their
lives
and
what
a
flood
of
calumny
would
be
let
loose
upon
the
unfortunate
devisers
of
the
scheme
firstly
to
withdraw
thousands
of
from
the
labour
market
would
be
a
crime
against
all
progress
and
then
to
treat
them
kindly
would
be
heresy
and
to
seclude
them
from
the
contamination
of
the
scum
of
europe
in
the
settlements
would
be
termed
unnatural
for
we
know
that
native
races
derive
most
benefit
from
free
competition
with
the
least
fitted
of
our
population
to
instruct
but
besides
agriculture
the
enormous
of
the
mission
territory
gave
occupation
to
many
of
the
neophytes
the
life
on
gave
less
scope
for
supervision
and
we
may
suppose
that
the
herders
and
the
cattlemen
were
more
like
gauchos
but
gauchos
under
religious
discipline
in
the
field
sitting
a
plunging
colt
as
if
they
were
part
of
him
and
when
on

at
home
submissive
to
the
jesuits
constant
in

but
not
so
fierce
and
bloodthirsty
as
their
descendants
soon
became
after

withdrawal
of

rule
dean

in

during

of
the
jesuits
there
were
head
of
cattle
as
well
as
agriculture
and
life
the
jesuits
had
introduced
amongst
the
indians
most
of
the
arts
and
trades
of
europe
by
the
inventories
taken
by
bucareli
viceroy
of
buenos
ayres
at
the
expulsion
of
the
order
we
find
that
they
wove
cotton
largely
sometimes
they
made
as
much
as
eight
thousand
five
hundred
yards
of
cloth
in
a
single
town
in
the
space
of
two
or
three
months
and
in
addition
to
weaving
they
had
tanneries
carpenters
shops
tailors
coopers
cartwrights
joiners
and
almost
every
industry
useful
and
necessary
to
life
they
also
made
arms
and
powder
musical
instruments
and
had
silversmiths
musicians
painters
turners
and
printers
to
work
their
for
many
books
were
printed
at
the
missions
and
they
produced
manuscripts
as
finely
executed
as

is
to

the

was

maintained
by
their

the
whole
under
the
direction
of
the
two
jesuits

lived
in

a

the

with

of

also
used
in

the

to

from

each

held
in
its

the
pauline
dictum
that
if
a

will
not
work
then
neither
shall
he
eat
but
as
they
held
it
so
they
practised
it
themselves
for
their

were
most
laborious
teaching

preaching
and
acting
as
overseers
to
the
indians
in
their
labours
continually
from
the
first
moment
of
their
arrival
at
the
missions
till
their
death
thus
if
the
mayor
of
the
township
complained
of
any
man
for
remissness
at
his

he
received
no
rations
till
he
had

to
inculcate
habits
of
providence
amongst
the
indians
always
inclined
to
consume
whatever
was
given
to
them
and
go
fasting
afterwards
they
issued
the
provisions
but
once
a
week
and
when
they
killed
their
oxen
forced
the
indians
to
a
certain
quantity
of
beef
to
last
throughout
the
week
vegetables
each
family
was
obliged
to
plant
both
in
their
gardens
and
in
the
common
fields
and
all
that
were
not
actually
consumed
were
dealt
out
to
the
workers
in
the
common
workshops
or
preserved
for
sale
this
jerked
beef
is
called
in
south
america
certain
of
the
indians
owned
their
own
cows
and
horses
and
had
gardens
in
which
they
worked
but
all
the
product
was
obliged
to
be
disposed
of
to
the
jesuits
for
the
common
good
and
in
exchange
for
them
they
gave
knives
scissors
cloth
and
and
other
articles
made
in
the
outside
world
clothes
were
served
out
to
every
indian
and
consisted
for
the
men
of
trousers
coarse
straw
hats
or
caps
and
shirts
but
neither
men
nor
women
ever
wore
shoes
and
the
sole
costume
of
the
latter
was
the
guarani
a
long
and
sleeveless
shift
cut
rather
high
and
with
coarse
embroidery
round
the
shoulders
and
made
of
a
rough
cotton
cloth
for
ornaments
they
had
glass
beads
and
rosaries
of
brass
or
silver
with
silver
rings
and
necklaces
of
glass
or
horn
from
which
hung
crucifixes
thus
food
and
clothing
cost
the
or
the
community
but
little
and
a
rude
plenty
was
the
order
of
the
land
the
greatest
luxury
of
the
indians
was
and
to
produce
it
they
worked
in
the
in
the
same
way
in
which
they
worked
their
fields
in
bands
and
with
processions
to
the
sound
of
hymns
and
headed
by
a
priest
the
poorer
classes

used
to
wear
the
they
covered
themselves
when
it
was

this
then
was
the
system
by

of
which
the
jesuits
succeeded
without
employing
force
of
any
kind
which
in
their
case
would
have
been
quite
impossible
lost
as
they
were
amongst
the
crowd
of
indians
in
making
the
guaranis
endure
the
yoke
of
toil
the
character
of
their
rule
accounts
for
the
hostility
of
liberals
who
like
azara
saw
in
competition
the
best
road
to
progress
but
who
like
him
in
their
consuming
thirst
for
progress
lost
sight
of
happiness
in
addition
to
the
means
described
the
jesuits
had
recourse
to
frequent
religious
feasts
for
which
the
calendar
gave
them
full
scope
so
that
the
life
in
a
jesuit
mission
was
much
diversified
and
rendered
pleasant
to
the
indians
who
have
a
rooted
love
of
show
each
mission
had
of
course
its
patron
saint
and
on
his
day
nobody
worked
whilst
all
was
joyfulness

simple
mirth
at
break
of
day
a
discharge
of
rockets
and
of
firearms
and
peals
upon
the
bells
announced
the
joyful
morn
then
the
whole
population
flocked
to
church
to
listen
to
an
early
mass
those
who
could
find
no
room
inside
the
church
stood
in
long
lines
outside
the
door
which
remained
open
during
the
ceremony
mass
over
each
one
ran
to
prepare
himself
for
his
part
in
the
function
the
jesuits
having
taken
care
by
multiplying
offices
and
employments
to
leave
no
man
without
a
direct
share
in
all
the
others
did
the
humblest
and
the
highest
had
their
part
and
the
heaviest
burden
no
doubt
fell
upon
the
two
jesuits
who
were
answerable
for
all
the
foremost
duty
was
to
get
the
procession
ready

the

that

rode

fastened
by
strips

round
their

and
hanging
down
below
their

not

was

no

almost
obscured
the

right
and
left
hand
of
the
choir
which
as
is
usual
in
spain
was
in
the
middle
of
the
church
the
younger
indians
were
seated
all
in
rows
the
boys
and
girls
being
separated
as
was
the
custom
in
all
the
missions
of
the
jesuits
who
no
doubt
were
convinced
of
the
advisability
of
the
saying
that
santa
y

the
indians
who
had
some
office
and
who
wore
the
i
have
described
were
seated
or
knelt
in
rows
and
at
the
outside
stood
the
people
of
the
town
dressed
in
white
cotton
their
simple
clothes
no
doubt
forming
an
effective
background
to
their
more
brethren
kneeling
in
the
front
throughout
the
church
the
men
and
women
were
separated
and
if
a
rumour
of
an
incursion
of
paulistas
was
in
the
air
the

such
were
the
outward
arts
with
which
the
jesuits
sought
to
attach
the
simple
people
to
whom
they
stood
in
the
position
not
only
of
pastors
and
masters
both
in
one
but
also
as
protectors
from
the
paulistas
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
from
the
spaniards
of
the
settlements
who
with
their
and
their
european
system
of
free
competition
between
man
and
man
were
perhaps
unknowingly
the
direst
enemies
of
the
whole
indian
race
there
is
as
it
would
seem
implanted
in
the
minds
of
almost
all
primitive
peoples
such
as
the
guaranis
a
solidarity
a
clinging
kinship
which
if
once
broken
down
by
competition
unrestrained
after
our
modern
fashion
inevitably
leads
to
their
decay
hence
the
keen
hatred
to
the
chinese
in
california
and
in
australia
naturally
those
whom
we
hate
and
in
a
measure
fear
we
also
vilify
and
this
has
given
rise
to
all
those
accusations
of
oriental
vice
as
if
the
vice
of
any
oriental
however
much
depraved
was
comparable
to
that
of
citizens
of
paris
or
of
london
of
barbarism
and
the
like
so
freely
levelled
against
the
unfortunate
chinese
in
paraguay
nothing
is
more
remarkable
in
a
market
in
the
country
than
the
way
in
which
the
people
will
not
undersell
each
other
even
refusing
to
part
with
goods
a
fraction
lower
than
the
price
which
they
consider
fair
it
may
be
that
the
jesuits
would
have
done
better
to
endeavour
to
equip
their
neophytes
more
fully
so
as
to
take
their
place
in
the
battle
of
the
world
it
may
be
that
the
simple
happy
lives
they
led
were
too
opposed
to
the
general
scheme
of
outside
human
life
to
find
acceptance
or
a
place
in
our
cosmogony
but
one
thing
i
am
sure
of
that
the
innocent
delight
of
the
poor
indian
alferez
real
mounted
upon
his
horse
dressed
in
his
motley
barefooted
and
overshadowed
by
his
hat
was
as
entire
as
if
he
had
eaten
of
all
the
fruits
of
all
the
trees
of
knowledge
of
his
time
and
so
perhaps
the
jesuits
were
wise
a
recent
writer
in
the
little
journal
published
on
yellow
in
the
socialist
colony
of
cosme
in
paraguay
monthly
november
has
a
curious
passage
corroborating
what
i
have
so
often
observed
myself
under
the
heading
of
paraguayan
market
he
says
guarani
clings
stubbornly
to
the
guarani
customs
this
is
irritating
to
the
european
but
who
shall
say
that
the
guarani
is
not
right
european
settlement
can
not
but
be
fatal
to
the
guarani
however
profitable
it
may
be
to
and
mercantile
classes
the
paraguayan
market
is
a
woman
club
they
will
come
thirty
or
forty
miles
with
a
clothful
of
the
white
of
the
country
contentedly
journeying
on
foot
along
the
narrow
paths
they
will
cut
a
cabbage
into
sixteenths
and
eat
their
cheese
themselves
rather
than
sell
it
under
market
price
long
may
they
do
so
for
so
long
will
they
be
free
and
perhaps
poor
but
then
in
countries
such
as
paraguay
freedom
and
poverty
are
identical
strangely
enough
but
then
how
strangely
all
extremes
meet
in
humanity
the
jesuits
alone
at
least
in
paraguay
seem
to
have
apprehended
as
the
arabs
certainly
have
done
from
immemorial
time
that
the
first
duty
of
a
man
is
to
enjoy
his
life
art
science
literature
ambition
all
the
frivolities
with
which
men
occupy
themselves
have
their
due
place
but
life
is
first
and
in
some
strange
mysterious
way
the
jesuits
felt
it
though
no
doubt
they
would
have
been
the
first
to
deny
it
with
a
thousand
oaths
but
in
a
jesuit
mission
all
was
not
feasting
or
processioning
for
with
such
neighbours
as
the
mamelucos
they
had
to
keep
themselves
prepared
as
for
their
better
government
in
home
affairs
each
mission
had
its
police
with
chosen
by
the
jesuits
amongst
the
indians
so
for
exterior
defence
they
had
militia
and
in
it
the
of
the
different
tribes
held
principal
command
most
likely
over
them
or
at
their
elbows
were
set
priests
who
before
entering
the
company
of
jesus
had
been
soldiers
for
there
were
many
such
amongst
the
jesuits
as
their
own
founder
once
had
been
a
soldier
so
the
company
was
popular
amongst
those
soldiers
who
from
some
cause
or
other
had
changed
their
swords
to
crucifixes
and
taken
service
in
the
ranks
of
christ
as
it
was
most
important
both
for
defence
and
policy
to
keep
the
content
they
were
distinguished
by
better
treatment
than
the
others
in
many
different
ways
their
food
was
more
abundant
and
a
guard
of
indians
was
on
perpetual
duty
round
the
houses
where
they
lived
these
they
employed
as
servants
and
as
messengers
to
summon
distant
companies
of
indians
to
the
field
their
method
of
organization
must
have
been
like
that
of
the
boers
or
of
the
arabs
for
every
indian
belonged
to
a
company
which
now
and
then
was
brought
together
for
evolutions
in
the
field
or
for
a
period
of
training
after
the
fashion
of
our
militia
or
the
german
landwehr
perhaps
this
system
of
an
armed
militia
always
ready
for
the
field
was
what
above
all
other
reasons
enabled
their
detractors
to
represent
the
jesuits
as
feared
and
unpopular
why
it
was
asked
does
this
community
of
priests
maintain
an
army
in
its
territories
no
one
remembered
that
if
such
were
not
the
case
the
missions
could
not
have
existed
for
a
year
without
a
force
to
defend
their
borders
from
the
paulistas
everyone
forgot
that
fathers
montoya
and
del
tano
had
obtained
special
permission
from
the
king
for
the
indians
of
the
missions
to
bear
arms
and
as
no
human
being
is
grateful
for
anything
but
contumelious
treatment
the
spanish
settlers
conveniently
forgot
how
many
times
a
jesuit
army
had
saved
their
territories
the
body
of
three
thousand
guaranis
sent
at
the
expense
of
the
company
to
assist
the
spaniards
against
the
portuguese
at
the
attack
upon
the
colonia
del
on
the
river
plate
in
was
quite
forgotten
together
with
the
innumerable
contingents
sent
by
the
jesuits
at
the
demand
of
spanish
governors
against
the
chaco
indians
the
payaguas
and
even
against
the
distant
calchaquis
in
what
is
now
the
province
of
jujuy
even
when
an
english
pirate
called
in
the
spanish
histories
roque
barloque
explained
by
some
to
be
plain
richard
barlow
appeared
off
buenos
ayres
the
undaunted
neophytes
shrank
not
a
moment
from
going
to
the
assistance
of
their
against
the
dog
lastly
all
spanish
governors
and
writers
both
contemporaneous
and
at
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
seem
to
forget
that
if
the
jesuits
had
an
army
of
neophytes
within
their
territory
the
fact
was
known
and
approved
of
at
the
court
of
spain
but
it
appears
that
calvin
had
many
coadjutors
in
his
policy
of
aut
necandi
aut
calumniis
opponendi
sunt
when
a
jesuit
army
took
the
field
driving
before
it
sufficient
cattle
to
subsist
upon
and
with
its
of
spare
horses
upon
its
flank
it
must
have
resembled
many
a
gaucho
army
i
have
seen
in
entre
rios
years
ago
the
only
difference
seems
to
have
been
that
the
gauchos
of
yesterday
did
not
use
bows
and
arrows
although
they
might
have
done
so
with
as
much
benefit
to
themselves
and
no
more
danger
to
their
enemies
than
was
occasioned
by
the
rusty
guns
they
used
to
bear
the
indians
were
armed
with
bows
and
in
their
expeditions
each
indian
carried
one
hundred
and
fifty
arrows
tipped
with
iron
others
had
firearms
but
all
bore
bolas
on
their
saddles
and
carried
lazos
and
long
lances
which
like
the
pampa
indians
they
used
in
mounting
their
horses
placing
one
hand
upon
the
mane
and
vaulting
into
the
saddles
with
the
other
leaning
on
the
lance
the
infantry
were
armed
with
lances
and
a
few
guns
they
also
carried
bolas
but
they
trusted
most
to
slings
for
which
they
carried
bags
of
hide
with
a
provision
of
smooth
round
stones
and
used
them
dexterously
on
several
occasions
their
rude
militia
gave
proofs
of
stubborn
valour
and
as
they
fought
under
the
jesuits
eyes
no
doubt
acquitted
themselves
as
men
would
who
looked
upon
their
priests
almost
in
the
light
of
gods
but
agriculture
and
were
not
all
the
resources
of
the
missions
for
the
jesuits
engaged
in
commerce
largely
both
with
the
outer
world
and
by
the
intricate
and
curious
barter
system
which
they
had
set
on
foot
for
the
mutual
convenience
of
the
different
mission
towns
in
many
of
the
inventories
printed
by
brabo
one
comes
across
the
entry
showing
a
sort
of
account
current
between
the
towns
for
various
articles
thus
they
exchanged
cattle
for
cotton
sugar
for
rice
wheat
for
or
tools
from
europe
as
no
account
of
interest
ever
appears
in
any
inventory
as
between
town
and
town
it
seems
the
jesuits
anticipated
socialism
at
least
so
far
as
that
they
bought
and
sold
for
use
and
not
for
gain
although
between
the
towns
of
their
own
territory
all
was
arranged
for
mutual
convenience
yet
in
their
dealings
with
the
outside
world
the
jesuits
adhered
to
what
are
known
as
principles
these
principles
if
i
mistake
not
have
been
deified
by
politicians
with
their
in
the
cheapest
sell
in
the
dearest
tag
and
therefore
even
the
sternest
protestant
or
jansenist
if
such
there
still
exist
can
have
no
stone
to
throw
at
the
company
of
jesus
for
its
participation
in
that
system
which
has
made
the
whole
world
glad
as

to
prove

thus
it
will
be
seen
that
the
missions
were
organized
both
agriculturally
and
commercially
so
as
to
be
almost
and
that
of
the
mere
necessaries
of
life
they
had
sufficient
for
exportation
no
small
achievement
when
we
consider
how
averse
from
labour
were
the
indians
with
whom
they
had
to
deal
but
that
nothing
should
be
wanting
that
a
civilized
community
could
possibly
desire
they
had
their
prisons
with
good
store
of
chains
fetters
whips
and
all
the
other
instruments
with
which
the
moral
code
is
generally
enforced
the
most
usual
punishment
was
whipping
and
the
crimes
most
frequent
were
drunkenness
neglect
of
work
and
bigamy
which
latter
lapse

the

chastised

the
on
the
other
side
in
a

of
an
eye
the
scene
is
changed
for
quite
in
hogarth
vein
he
paints
the
missions
as
a
perpetual
march
to
finchley
and
tells
us
that
the
indians
were
savages
and
quite
unchanged
in
all
their
primitive
propensities
under
the
jesuit
rule
and
for
the
jesuits
themselves
he
has

after
the
fashion
of
the
renegade
the
whole
world
over
who
sees
nothing
good
in
the
society
that
has
turned
him
out
he
roundly
says
the
jesuits
were
loafers
accuses
them
of
keeping
the
indians
ignorant
for
their
own
purposes
and
paints
them
quite
as
black
as
the
abbe
muratori
painted
them
rose
colour
and
with
as
little
art
so
that
as
usually
happens
in
the
writings
of
all
polemists
no
matter
upon
which
side
they
may
write
but
little
information
and
that
distorted
to
an
incredible

is
all
that

in
general
curious
as
it
may
appear
the
bitterest
opponents
of
the

catholics

protestants
have
often
written
as

buffon

which
it
produced
no
other
names
of
equal
authority
can
be
quoted
on
the
other
side
but
yet
the
fact
remains
that
the
jesuits
in
paraguay
were
exposed
to
constant
calumny
from
the
first
day
they
went
there
till
the
last
member
of

left
the
land
it
is
my
object
first
to
try
to
show
what
the
conditions
of
their
government
really
were
and
then
to
try
and
clear
up
what
was
the
cause
of
unpopularity
and
why
so
many
and
such
persistent
calumnies
were
laid
to
their
account
stretching

the

had
his
official

from
thence
he

the

only
the
ecclesiastical
but
the
temporal

the
latter
from
the

in
which
he
was

many

from

by

gradually
come
into

the
little

when
i

it
in
a
most
neglected

the
buildings
of
the

was

much
quieter

in

two
chosen
jesuits
lived
the

selected
for
his
experience
of
the

knowledge
of
the
tongue
from
amongst
those
who
had
been

of
colleges
or
provincials
of
the

was
vested
with
the
civil

and
was

the
superior
the
second
generally
styled
companion

acted
as

had

of
all
things
spiritual
so
that
they
were
a
check
on
one
another
and
their
duties
did
not
clash
in
difficulties
the
superior
transmitted
orders
like
a
general
in
the
field
by
mounted
messengers
who
frequently
rode
over
a
hundred
miles
a
day
relays
of
horses
always
being
kept
ready
for
emergencies
every
three
leagues
upon
the
road
from
la
candelaria
roads
branched
off
to
every
portion
of
the
territory
most
of
them
fit
for
carts
and
all
superior
to
those
tracks
which
were
the
only
thoroughfares
but
twenty
years
ago
roads
ran
to
corrientes
to
asuncion
others
from
yapeyu
to
the
salto
grande
on
the
parana
upon
the
upper
uruguay
were
about
eighty
posts
all
guarded
and
with
horses
ready
to
equip
the
messengers
but
there
were
also
roads
in
the
district
of
the
upper
parana
which
i
myself
remember
as
a
wilderness
uncrossed
uncrossable
where
tigers
roamed
about
and
indians
shot
at
the
rare
traveller
with
poisoned
arrows
out
of
a
whilst
they
remained
unseen
in
the
recesses
of
the
woods
in
the
districts
of
the
upper
uruguay
and
parana
besides
the
roads
and
relays
of
they
had
a
fleet
both
of
canoes
and
boats
in
which
they
carried
and
the
other
products
of
the
land
thus
with
their
fleet
of
boats
and
of
canoes
their
highroads
branching
out
on
every
side
and
their
relays
of
at
intervals
most
probably
no
state
of
america
at
the
time
had
such
interior
means
of
communication
with
the
seat
of
government
the
incas
and
the
aztecs
certainly
had
posts
who
carried
messages
and
brought
up
fish
from
the
coast
with
great
rapidity
but
all
the
spanish
colonies
contemporaneous
with
the
jesuits
settlements
in
paraguay
had
fallen
into
a
state
of
lethargy
and
of
interior
decay
the
roads
the
incas
used
in
peru
were
falling
fast
into
disuse
and
it
took
several
weeks
to
send
a
letter
from
buenos
ayres
to
the
pacific
coast
a
letter
of
a
certain
jesuit
name
lost
but
dated
says
that
there
were
at
least
two
thousand
canoes
in
constant
use
on
the
parana
and
almost
as
many
more
on
the
uruguay
brabo
the
system
of
interior
government
in
the
missions
was
in
appearance
democratic
that
is
to
say
there
were
officials
as
and
councillors
but
most
of
them
were
named
by
the
jesuits
and
all
of
them
even
although
elected
owed
their
election
entirely
to
their
priests
this
sort
of
representation
was
the
most
fitting
for
the
indians
at
the
time
and
those
who
look
into
the
workings
of
a
county
council
of
can
not
but
think
at
times
that
the
majority
of
the
councillors
would
have
been
better
chosen
had
the
electorate
had
the
benefit
of
some
controlling
hand
though
from
what
quarter
it
is
difficult
to
see
the
problem
which
most
writers
on
the
jesuits
have
quite
misunderstood
is
how
two
jesuits
were
able
to
keep
a
mission
of
several
thousand
indians
in
order
and
to
rule
supreme
without
armed
forces
or
any
means
of
making
their
power
felt
or
of
enforcing
obedience
to
their
decrees
undoubtedly
the
dangerous
position
in
which
the
indians
stood
exposed
on
one
side
to
the
paulistas
and
on
the
other
to
the
spanish
settlers
both
of
whom
wished
to
take
them
as
their
slaves
placed
power
in
the
jesuits
hands
for
the
indians
clearly
perceived
that
the
jesuits
alone
stood
between
them
and
instant
slavery
most
controversialists
who
have
opposed
the
jesuits
assert
that
the
indians
of
the
missions
were
in
reality
half
slaves
nothing
is
further
from
the
truth
if
one
consults
the
contemporary
records
and
remembers
the
small
number
of
the
jesuits
the
work
the
indians
did
was
inconsiderable
and
under
such
conditions
as
to
deprive
it
of
much
of
the
toilsomeness
which
is
incident
to
any
kind
of
work
the
very
essence
of
a
slave
estate
is
being
obliged
to
work
without
remuneration
for
another
man
nothing
was
farther
from
the
indians
than
such
a
state
of
things
their
work
was
done
for
the
community
and
though
the
jesuits
without
doubt
had
the
full
disposition
of
all
the
money
earned
in
commerce
and
of
the
distribution
of
the
goods
neither
the
money
nor
the
goods
were
used
for
but
were
laid
out
for
the
benefit
of
the
community
at
large
the
total
population
of
the
thirty
towns
is
variously
estimated
from
one
hundred
and
forty
to
one
hundred
and
eighty
thousand
and
curiously
enough
it
remained
almost
at
the
same
figure
during
the
whole
period
of
the
jesuit
rule
this
fact
has
been
adduced
against
the
jesuits
and
it
has
been
said
that
they
could
not
have
been
good
rulers
or
the
population
must
have
increased
but
those
who
say
so
forget
that
the
indians
of
paraguay
were
never
in
great
numbers
and
that
most
writers
on
the
wild
tribes
as
and
azara
remark
their
tendency
never
to
increase
corregidores

alcaldes
etc
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
however
that
the
indians
were
kept
in
ignorance
cardiel
de
la
verdad
quoting
from
the
cedula
real
of
says
that
every
one
of
the
towns
there
is
a
school
established
to
teach
reading
and
writing
in
spanish
and
that
on
that
account
a
great
number
of
indians
are
to
be
met
who
write
well

puts

of

towns
at
a
hundred
thousand

and
informs
us
that
after
taxation
to
the
crown
had
been
deducted
from
it
it
was
applied
to
the
maintenance
of
the
churches
and
other
necessary
expenses

by

little
of
it
remained

all
this
relatively
large
population
of
indians
was
ruled
as
has
been
seen
by
a
quite
inconsiderable
number
of
priests
who
not
disposing
of
any
european

and
being
almost
always
on
bad
terms
with
the
spanish

in

on

of
the
firm
stand
they
made
against
the
enslaving
of
the
indians
had
no
means
of
coercion
at
their
command
hence
the
indians
must
have
been
contented
with
their
rule
for
if
they
had
not
been
so
the
jesuits
possessed
no
power
to
stop
them
from
returning

their
savage
life

significant
passage

enumerating
the
amount
of
taxes

by
the

he
says

seldom
enough
does
such
a
result
take
place
when
the
balance
is
struck
in
any
country
between
the
rulers
and
their
following
their
system
of
perfect
isolation
from
the
world
to
its
logical
sequence
the
jesuits
surrounded
all
the
territories
of
their
different
towns
with
walls
and
ditches
and
at
the
gates
planted
a
guard
to
prevent
egress
or
ingress
between
the
missions
and
the
outer
world
much
capital
has
been
made
out
of
this
as
it
is
attempted
to
be
shown
that
the
indians
were
thereby
treated
as
prisoners
in
their
own
territories
nothing
however
has
been
said
of
the
fact
that
if
the
ditches
palisades
and
kept
in
the
indians
they
also
had
the
effect
of
keeping
the
spaniards
out
when
men
who
looked
upon
the
indians
as
without
reason
and
captured
them
for
slaves
when
it
was
possible
began
to
talk
of
liberty
it
looks
as
if
the
name
of
liberty
was
used
but
as
a
as
greasy
testaments
are
used
to
swear
upon
in
when
the
witness
with
his
tongue
in
his
cheek
raises
his
eyes
to
heaven
and

it
will
be
seen
that
the
communism
of
the
missions
was
of
a
limited
character
and
though
the
land
was
cultivated
by
the
labour
of
the
community
that
the
products
were
administered
by
the
jesuits
alone
though
it
has
been
stated
by
many
polemical
writers
such
as
ibanez
and
azara
and
more
recently
by
washburne
who
was
american
minister
in
paraguay
during
the
war
with
brazil
and
the
argentine
republic
that
the
jesuits
had
amassed
great
wealth
in
paraguay
no
proof
has
ever
been
advanced
for
such
a
charge
certainly
cardenas
made
the
same
statement
but
it
was
never
in
his
power
to
bring
any
confirmation
of
what
he
said
this
power
alone
was
in
the
hands
of
bucareli
the
viceroy
of
buenos
ayres
under
whose
auspices
the
expulsion
of
the
jesuits
was
carried
out
by
several
extracts
from
brabo
inventories
and
by
the
statement
of
the
receivers
sent
by
bucareli
i
hope
to
show
that
there
was
no
great
wealth
at
any
time
in
the
mission
territory
and
that
the
income
was
expended
in
the
territory
itself
it
may
be
that
the
expenditure
on
churches
was
excessive
and
also
that
the
money
laid
out
on
religious
ceremonies
was
not
productive
but
the
jesuits
strange
as
it
may
appear
did
not
conduct
the
missions
after
the
fashion
of
a
business
concern
but
rather
as
the
rulers
of
some
utopia
those
foolish
beings
who
think
happiness
is
preferable
to
wealth
nothing

manner
of
living
of
the
father
is
to
shut
all
the
doors
and
remain
alone
with
his
servant
and
his
cook
who
are
indians
of
a
considerable
age
and
these
only
wait
on
him
but
by
day
only
and
at
twelve
they
go
out
and
an
old
man
has
care
of
the
porter
lodge
and
it
is
he
who
shuts
the
gate
when
the
father
is
asleep
or
when
he
goes
out
to
see
his
cultivated
ground
and
even
then
they
go
alone
except
it
be
with
an
old
indian
who
guides
them
and
attends
to
the
father
horse
and
after
that
he
goes
to
mass
and
in
the
evening
to
the
rosary
of
the
blessed
virgin
calling
us
together
by
the
sound
of
the
bell
and
before
that
he
calls
the
boys
and
girls
with
a
small
bell
and
after
that
the
good
father
begins
to
teach
them
doctrine
and
how
to
cross
themselves
in
the
same
way
on
every
feast
day
he
preaches
to
us
the
word
of
god
in
the
same
way
the
holy
sacrament
of
penitence
and
of
the
communion
in
these
things
does
the
good
father
employ
himself
and
every
night
the
porter
lodge
is
closed
and
the
key
taken
to
the
father
room
which
is
only
opened
in
the
morning
in
order
that
the
sacristan
and
the
cooks
may
enter
fathers
every
morning
say
mass
for
us
and
after
mass
they
go
to
their
rooms
and
then
they
take
some
hot
water
and
and
nothing
more
after
that
he
comes
to
the
door
of
his
apartment
and
then
all
those
who
heard
mass
come
to
kiss
his
hand
and
after
that
he
goes
out
to
see
if
the
indians
are
diligent
at
their
tasks
and
afterwards
they
go
to
their
room
to
read
the
divine
service
for
the
day
in
his
book
and
to
pray
that
god
may
prosper
him
in
all
his
affairs
at
eleven
they
go
to
eat
a
little
not
to
eat
much
for
he
only
has
five
dishes
and
only
drinks
wine
once
not
filling
a
little
glass
and
spirits
they
never
drink
and
there
is
no
wine
in
our
town
except
that
which
is
brought
from
candelaria
according
to
that
which
the
superior
sends
and
they
bring
it
from
somewhere
near
buenos
aires
after
he
has
finished
eating
to
rest
a
little
he
goes
into
the
church
afterwards
yes
he
retires
to
rest
a
little
and
whilst
he
is
resting
those
who
work
in
the
father
house
go
out
and
those
who
do
any
kind
of
indoor
work
and
also
the
sacristan
and
the
cook
all
these
go
out
and
as
long
as
the
bell
does
not
ring
the
doors
are
shut
and
only
an
old
man
guards
the
gate
and
when
they
ring
the
bell
again
he
opens
the
doors
so
that
those
who
work
indoors
may
go
inside
and
the
father
takes
his
breviary
and
goes
nowhere
in
the
evening
they
ring
the
bell
so
that
the
children
may
come
home
and
the
father
comes
in
to
teach
them
christian
doctrine
perhaps
the
foregoing
simple
description
written
by
an
indian
in
guarani
and
translated
by
someone
who
has
preserved
in
spanish
all
the
curious
inversions
of
the
guarani
presents
as
good
a
picture
of
the
daily
life
of
a
mission
priest
in
paraguay
as
any
that
has
ever
been
given
to
the
public
by
writers
much
more
ambitious
than
myself
or
neenguiru
nicolas
neenguiru
the
writer
of
the
letter
afterwards
figured
in
the
war
against
the
portuguese
and
several
of
his
letters
are
preserved
in
the
archives
of
simancas
though
none
so
interesting
and
simple
as
that
i
have
transcribed
dobrizhoffer
in
his
history
of
the
abipones
says
of
him
that
he
was
a
simple
indian
whom
often
he
had
seen
put
in
the
stocks
for
petty
faults
at
any
rate
he
seems
to
have
been
one
of
those
indians
whom
the
jesuits
had
at
least
favourably
impressed
by
the
system
they
employed
after
the
manner
in
which
he
wrote
hundreds
of
indians
must
have
thought
or
else
the
missions
placed
as
they
were
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
enemies
could
not
have
endured
a
single
day
what
was
it
then
which
raised
the
jesuits
up
so
many
and
so
powerful
enemies
in
paraguay
when
in
the
districts
of
the
and
the
chiquitos
where
their
power
was
to
the
full
as
great
amongst
the
indians
they
never
had
a
quarrel
with
the
spaniards
till
the
day
they
were
expelled
many
and
various
causes
contributed
to
all
they
underwent
but
most
undoubtedly
two
reasons
must
have
brought
about
their
fall
perhaps
the
entire
isolation
of
the
jesuits
in
these
two
provinces
accounts
for
their
absolute
quiet
and
if
this
is
so
it
goes
far
to
prove
that
they
were
right
to
attempt
the
same
isolation
in
paraguay
the
comparative
nearness
of
the
spanish
settlements
frustrated
their
attempts
in
this
instance
since
the
time
of
cardenas
the
report
that
the
jesuits
had
rich
mines
which
they
worked
on
the
sly
had
been
persistently
on
the
increase
although
disproved
a
thousand
times
it
still
remained
even
in
spite
of
and
its
wonderful
discoveries
there
are
many
in
paraguay
who
cherish
dreams
of
discovering
jesuit
mines
humanity
loves
to
deceive
itself
although
there
are
plenty
ready
to
deceive
it
and
if
men
can
both
forge
for
themselves
fables
and
at
the
same
time
damage
their
neighbours
in
so
doing
their
pleasure
is
intense
i
take
it
that
many
really
believed
the
stories
of
the
mines
being
unable
to
credit
that
anyone
would
live
far
from
the
world
surrounded
but
by
indians
for
any
other
reason
than
to
be
rich
but
let
a
country
have
rich
minerals
even
if
they
exist
but
in
imagination
and
it
becomes
a
crime
against
humanity
to
shut
it
up
so
that
it
would
appear
one
of
the
reasons
which
induced
hatred
against
the
jesuits
was
the
idea
that
they
had
enormous
mineral
wealth
which
either
they
did
not
work
or
else
worked
in
secret
for
the
benefit
of
their
society
the
other
reason
was
the
question
of
slavery
once
get
it
well
into
your
head
that
you
and
yours
are
de
razon
and
that
all
coloured
people
are
irrational
and
slavery
follows
as
a
natural
sequence
for
men
have
wit
to
make
a
gun
and
on
the
gun
all
reason
takes
it
stand
from
the
first
instant
of
their
arrival
in
america
the
jesuits
had
maintained
a
firm
front
against
the
enslavement
of
the
indians
they
may
have
had
their
faults
in
europe
and
in
the
larger
centres
of
population
in
america
but
where
they
came
in
contact
with
the
indians
theirs
was
the
sole
voice
raised
upon
their
side
for
men
and
how
this
monstrous
superstition
still
prevails
in
venezuela
see

a
really
interesting
book
of
travels
without
cant
and
without
an
eye
on
the
public
strange
to
relate
the
author
seems
to
have
killed
nothing
during
his
journey
in
padre
juan
romero
sent
from
peru
as
superior
to
paraguay
on
his
arrival
gave
up
an
estate
with
indians
in
which
his
predecessors
had
enjoyed
alleging
that
he
did
not
wish
to
give
the
example
of
making
profit
out
of
the
unpaid
labour
of
the
indians
and
that
without
their
work
the
estate
was
valueless
charlevoix
book
iv
on
many
occasions
notably
in
the
time
of
cardenas
the
jesuits
openly
withstood
all
slavery
and
amongst
the
concessions
that
ruiz
montoya
obtained
from
the
king
of
spain
was
one
declaring
all
the
indians
to
be
free
if
more
examples
of
the
hatred
that
their
attitude
on
slavery
called
forth
were
wanting
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
in
when
montoya
and
tano
returned
from
spain
and
affixed
the
edict
of
the
pope
on
the
church
doors
in
piritinanga
threatening
with
excommunication
all
a
cry
of
robbery
went
forth
and
the
jesuits
were
banished
from
the
town
but
in
this
matter
of
slavery
there
is
no
saying
what
view
any
one
given
man
will
take
upon
it
when
he
finds
himself
in
such
a
country
as
america
was
during
the
time
the
jesuits
were
in
paraguay
don
felix
de
azara
a
liberal
and
a
philosopher
a
man
of
science
and
who
has
left
us
perhaps
the
best
description
both
of
paraguay
and
of
the
river
plate
written
in
the
eighteenth
century
yet
was
a
partisan
of
slavery
in
a
most
curious
passage
for
a
liberal
philosopher
he
says
court
ordered
don
francisco
judge
of
the
high
court
of
charcas
to
go
to
peru
in
the
character
of
visitor
the
first
measure
which
he
took
in
was
to
order
that
in
future
no
one
should
go
to
the
indians
houses
with
the
pretext
of
reducing
them
to
civilization
and
that
no
fiefs
should
be
given
of
the
kind
we
have
explained
that
is
to
say
with
personal
service
of
the
indians
i
can
not
understand
on
what
he
could
have
founded
a
measure
so
politically
absurd
but
as
that
judge
favoured
the
of
the
jesuits
it
is
suspected
that
they
dictated
his
conduct

que
por

what
stronger
testimony

could
possibly
be
found
both
that
the
jesuits
were
opposed
to
the
enslaving
of
the
indians
and
that
their
opposition
rendered
them
unpopular
in
the

way
no
doubt
some
modern
unwise
philosopher
writing
in

would
uphold
the
slavery
and
massacres
in

as
evidences
of

wise
policy

condones

and
every
will
be
forced
to
supply
himself
at
but
a
trifle
above
the
cost
in
belgium
with
a
sufficiency
of
comfortable
and
thoroughly
wooden
shoes
so
it
appears
that
the
aforesaid
were
the
two
chief
reasons
which
made
the
jesuits
unpopular
with
the
spanish
settlers
in
paraguay
but
in
addition
it
should
be
remembered
that
there
were
in
that
country
members
of
almost
all
the
other
religious
orders
and
that
as
nearly
every
one
of
them
had
quarrelled
with
the
jesuits
in
europe
or
at
the
best
were
jealous
of
their
power
the
enmities
begun
in
europe
were
transmitted
to
the
new
world
and
constantly
fanned
by
reports
of
the
quarrels
which
went
on
between
the
various
orders
all
through
europe
and
especially
in
rome
but
if
it
were
the
case
that
the
jesuits
excited
feelings
of
hatred
in
their
neighbours
yet
they
certainly
had
the
gift
of
attaching
to
themselves
the
indians
hearts
no
institution
condemned
with
contumely
and
thrust
out
of
a
country
where
it
had
worked
for
long
its
supposed
crimes
kept
secret
and
its
members
all
condemned
unheard
could
have
preserved
its
popularity
amongst
the
descendants
of
the
men
with
whom
it
worked
after
more
than
one
hundred
years
have
passed
had
this
not
been
the
case
i
care
not
in
the
least
for
theories
for
this
or
that
dogma
of
politicians
or
theologists
but
take
my
stand
on
what
i
heard
myself
during
my
visits
to
the
now
ruined
jesuit
missions
in
paraguay
horsemen
say
horses
can
go
in
any
shape
and
wonderful
as
it
may
seem
men
can
be
happy
under
conditions
which
no
writer
on
political
economy
would
recognise
as
fit
for
human
beings
not
once
but
many
times
have
aged
indians
told
me
of
what
their
fathers
used
to
say
about
the
jesuits
and
they
themselves
always
spoke
of
them
with
respect
and
kindness
and
endeavoured
to
keep
up
to
the
best
of
their
ability
all
the
traditions
of
the
church
ceremonies
and
hours
of
prayer
which
the
jesuits
had
instilled
that
the
interior
system
of
their
government
was
perfect
or
such
as
would
be
suitable
for
men
called
is
not
the
case
that
it
was
not
only
suitable
but
perhaps
the
best
that
under
all
the
circumstances
could
have
been
devised
for
indian
tribes
two
hundred
years
ago
and
then
but
just
emerged
from
is
i
think
clear
when
one
remembers
in
what
a
state
of
misery
and
despair
the
indians
of
the
and
the
passed
their
lives
that
with
a
controlling
hand
in
administrative
affairs
produced
many
superior
men
or
such
as
rise
to
the
top
in
modern
times
i
do
not
think
but
then
who
are
the
men
and
by
the
exercise
of
what
kind
of
virtues
do
they
rise
in
the
societies
of
modern
times
the
jesuits
aim
was
to
make
the
great
bulk
of
the
indians
under
their
control
contented
and
that
they
gained
their
end
the
complaints
against
them
by
the
surrounding
population
of
and
hunters
after
slaves
go
far
to
prove
for
and
see
foregoing
chapters
leaving
upon
one
side
their
system
of
administration
and
discounting
their
unalterable
perseverance
there
were
two
things
on
which
the
jesuits
appealed
to
the
indians
and
those
two
things
by
the
very
nature
of
their
knowledge
of
mankind
they
knew
appealed
as
much
to
indians
as
to
any
other
race
of
men
firstly
and
in
this
writers
opposed
to
them
as
and
azara
both
agree
they
instilled
into
the
indians
that
the
land
on
which
they
lived
with
missions
churches
herds
flocks
and
the
rest
was
their
own
property
and
in
the
second
place
they
told
them
they
were
free
and
that
they
had
the
king
of
spain
own
edict
in
confirmation
of
their
freedom
so
that
they
never
could
be
slaves
neither
of
these
two
propositions
commends
itself
to
many
writers
on
the
jesuits
in
paraguay
but
for
all
that
it
seems
to
me
that
in
themselves
they
were
sufficient
to
account
for
the
firm
hold
the
jesuits
had
on
their
neophytes

the
freedom
which
the
indians
enjoyed
under

might
not
have
seemed
excessive
to
modern
minds
and
those
attuned
to
the
mild
rule
of
the
europeans
of

such
as
it
was
it
seemed
sufficient
to
the
guaranis

even
in

degree
placed
them
above
the

in
that
year
don
jose
de
antequera
was
appointed
to
succeed
the
governor
of
paraguay
don
diego
de
los
reyes
balmaceda
when
his
term
of
office
had
expired
the
situation
was
as
often
happened
in
the
spanish
colonies
complicated
by
an
inquiry
into
the
conduct
of
the
governor
balmaceda
in
progress
at
the
high
court
of
charcas
which
court
as
in
the
case
of
cardenas
acted
most
cautiously
both
on
account
of
its
position
so
far
from
paraguay
and
on
account
of
the
inordinate
procrastination
of
everything
connected
with
the
spanish
law
if
balmaceda
were
condemned
then
antequera
would
step
into
his
shoes
at
once
if
on
the
other
hand
he
were
acquitted
antequera
would
have
to
wait
until
the
legal
time
of
office
had
run
its
course
so
far
all
was
in
order
but
the
high
court
either
in
doubt
of
its
own
wisdom
or
of
its
power
to
pronounce
judgment
definitely
had
issued
a
decree
suspending
balmaceda
from
his
functions
but
without
either
condemning
or
acquitting
him
this
too
they
did
after
having
taken
more
than
three
years
to
sift
the
evidence
and
summon
witnesses
who
either
had
to
cross
the
country
on
a
mule
at
the
imminent
risk
of
death
by
famine
or
by
indians
or
having
descended
the
river
plate
to
buenos
ayres
which
journey
often
took
a
month
wait
for
a
ship
to
take
them
round

to
lima
and
from
thence
travel
to
charcas
on

following
one
of
the
incas
roads
don
jose
de
antequera
y
castro
was
born
at
lima
and
being
as
father
says
an
able
eloquent
but
vain
and
most
ambitious
man
endowed
with
plenty
of
imagination
some
talent
and
but
little
ballast
was
not
content
to
wait
till
time
should
place
him
in
his
governorship
so
hearing
that
a
judge
inquisitor
was
to
be
sent
to
paraguay
to
inquire
into
the
case
and
having
graduated
himself
and
held
the
position
of
procurator
fiscal
in
the
charcas
he
solicited
the
post
and
by
some
error
was
appointed
charlevoix
vol
livre
xvii
no
sooner
was
the
appointment
signed
than
straight
he
posted
off
to
paraguay
as
he
had
studied
in
the
college
of
the
jesuits
at
la
plata
his
first
visit
was
to
the
reductions
of
the
jesuits
the
missionaries
received
him
well
and
sent
a
troop
of
indians
to
escort
him
to
the
boundary
of
their
territories
never
suspecting
what
antequera
was
about
to
do
having
heard
that
the
governor
balmaceda
was
at
a
distant
port
upon
the
parana
antequera
hastened
to
asuncion
arrived
there
the
same
madness
of
authority
seems
to
have
come
on
him
which
came
fifty
or
sixty
years
before
his
time
on
cardenas
finding
no
special
seat
reserved
for
him
in
the
cathedral
he
publicly
reproved
the
dean
to
the
great
scandal
of
the
worshippers
this
seems
not
to
have
lost
him
the
respect
of
the
citizens
of
asuncion
who
were
accustomed
to
all
kinds
of
vagaries
both
of
their
rulers
and
their
spiritual
guides
no
sort
of
violence
to
laws
and
customs
seems
ever
to
affect
a
people
unless
the
violence
is
done
to
benefit
them
when
instantly
they
rise
against
the
breaker
of
the
law
however
heavily
it
may
bear
upon
themselves
but
the
devoted
citizens
of
asuncion
were
so
accustomed
to
perpetual
turmoil
that
as
dean
says
only
stopped
when
it
was
absolutely
necessary
for
them
to
breathe
even
the
overpraised
citizens
of
athens
at
the
time
of
pericles
who
must
have
been
in
all
their
ways
so
like
the
athenians
of
were
not
more
instant
in
the
agora
or
diligent
in
writing
patriots
names
on
than
the
noisy
mob
of
patriots
who
in
the
sandy
streets
of
asuncion
were
ever
agitating
always
assembling
and
doing
everything
within
their
power
to
show
the
world
the
perfect
picture
of
a
democratic
state
strange
that
such
turbulent
and
patriotic
people
should
have
been
ancestors
of
those
whom
i
after
the
termination
of
the
war
with
buenos
ayres
and
brazil
in
knew
as
lethargic
and
downtrodden
as
if
the
great
dictator
francia
whom
the
country
people
speaking
in
bated
breath
called
difunto
had
still
oppressed
the
land
into
the
turbulent
hotbed
of
asuncion
fell
antequera
one
of
those
creoles
of
peru
who
born
with
talent
and
well
educated
seemed
either
from
the
circumstances
of
their
birth
or
the
surroundings
amongst
which
they
passed
their
youth
to
differ
as
entirely
from
the
spaniards
as
if
they
had
been
indians
and
not
creoles
of
white
blood
like
cardenas
antequera
was
endowed
with
eloquence
but
unlike
cardenas
he
set
no
store
on
eloquence
upon
its
own
account
but
only
used
it
for
his
own
advancement
in
the
world
finding
the
governor
absent
from
asuncion
and
lying
under
a
decree
suspending
him
from
all
his
functions
it
seems
at
once
to
have
occurred
to
antequera
to
seize
his
place
on
this
account
having
ingratiated
himself
with
some
of
those
opposed
to
balmaceda
he
raised
an
army
and
sent
to
seize
him
but
the
governor
having
notice
of
the
plot
escaped
to
corrientes
and
antequera
instantly
assumed
his
post
this
was
too
much
for
the
viceroy
of
peru
who
though
he
had
befriended
antequera
in
the
past
had
some
respect
for
law
immediately
he
issued
a
decree
replacing
balmaceda
in
the
governorship
and
ordering
antequera
to
give
him
back
the
power
he
had
usurped
this
antequera
had
no
thought
of
doing
and
he
embarked
on
a
career
of
violence
which
induced
some
to
believe
he
intended
to
proclaim
himself
an
independent
king
whether
this
was
or
was
not
the
case
a
state
of
things
arose
in
paraguay
more
pandemonic
even
than
in
the
good
old
times
of
cardenas
the
jesuits
not
having
seen
their
way
to
sustain
the
cause
of
their
were
expelled
once
more
and
as
before
took
ship
for
corrientes
amongst
the
tears
of
the
people
their
historians
say
and
as
ibanez
and
those
who
have
written
against
them
affirm
as
strongly
amongst
universal
joy
certain
it
is
that
in
asuncion
they
played
a
different
part
from
that
played
by
them
in
the
mission
territory
and
no
doubt
mixed
as
did
the
other
orders
of
religion
in
the
intrigues
which
never
seemed
to
cease

restless

having

in

and
carried
him
back
to

under

close
guard
the
usual
reign

terror
then
began
and
everything
fell
into
confusion
till
at
last
the
king
philip
in
commanded
that
the
jesuits
should
be
reinstated
in
their
college
in
asuncion
and
that
the
missions
should
be
taken
from
the
jurisdiction
of
the
governors
of

and
placed
under
the
control
of
the
governor
of
the

as
had
been
previously
done
in
the
case
of
the
other
jesuit
missions
beyond
the
uruguay
but
spain
was
far
away
and
on
one
pretext
or
another
so
much
delay
occurred
that
it
was
not
till
march
that
the
jesuits
were
reinstated
in
the
college
in
asuncion
which
they
were
now
fated
to
hold
but
for
a
little
space
at
last
the
viceroy
of
peru
the
marquess
of
castel
fuerte
sent
don
bruno
de
zavala
with
a
sufficient
army
and
six
thousand
indians
from
the
missions
against
the
usurper
antequera
who
fled
for
refuge
to
the
franciscan
convent
in
cordoba
where
he
remained
till
finding
his
position
quite
untenable
he
fled
to
charcas
where
he
was
arrested
and
sent
to
lima
to
await
his
trial
four
years
he
waited
in
perfect
liberty
going
and
coming
about
the
town
as
it
best
pleased
him
whilst
the
high
court
heard
evidence
wrote
to
madrid
received
instructions
from
the
king
and
generally
displayed
the
incapacity
which
in
all
ages
has
been
the
chief
distinctive
features
of
every
court
of
law
in
an
order
came
from
madrid
to
execute
him
and
without
loss
of
time
he
was
placed
on
a
horse
draped
all
in
black
and
preceded
by
a
herald
and
guarded
by
a
troop
of
guards
taken
out
to
the
public
square
to
be
beheaded
but
the
good
people
of
the
capital
who
in
the
fashion
of
the
world
would
not
most
probably
have
stirred
a
step
to
save
a
saint
were
mightily
concerned
to
see
a
rogue
receive
his
due
deserts
the
streets
were
filled
with
thousands
crying
out
stones
flew
and
the
affair
looked
so
threatening
that
the
viceroy
had
to
get
on
horseback
and
ride
amongst
the
crowd
to
calm
the
tumult
the
people
met
him
with
a
shower
of
stones
and
he
fearing
the
prisoner
would
escape
called
on
his
guards
to
fire
upon
him
four
balls
pierced
antequera
who
fell
dying
from
his
horse
into
the
arms
of
two
accompanying
priests
thus
the
most
turbulent
of
all
the
governors
of
paraguay
ceased
troubling
and
the
executioner
after
having
cut
off
his
head
exhibited
it
to
the
people
from
the
scaffold
with
the
usual
moral
aphorism
as
to
the
traitor
fate
the
triumph
of
the
jesuits
in
asuncion
was
but
momentary
following
the
general
rule
of
triumphs
which
take
their
way
along
the
street
with
trumpets
and
with
drums
amid
the
acclamations
of
the

and
then
the
pageant
over
the
chief
actors
fall
back
again
into
the
struggles
and
the
commonplace
of
ordinary
life
between
the
years
and
the
people
of
asuncion
had
been
more
eager
in
pursuit
of
than
was
their
usual
wont
the
citizens
were
divided
into
camps
and
daily
fought
amongst
the
sandy
streets
and
shady
lanes
which
radiate
from
almost
every
quarter
of
the
town
the
rival
bands
of
madmen
were
styled
respectively
the
and
the
and
to
the
first
antequera
throughout
his
residence
in
lima
gave
all
the
assistance
in
his
power
neither
of
the
two
seems
to
have
had
the
most
elementary
idea
of
real
patriotism
or
any
wish
for
anything
beyond
the
momentary
triumph
of
the
miserable
party
to
which
each
belonged
one
doctrine
they
held
in
common
a
hatred
of
the
jesuits
and
of
the
influence
they
exercised
against
the
enslaving
of
the
indians
which
was
the
aim
of
and
of
alike
one
of
the
rival
chieftains
of
the
factions
having
fled
for
refuge
to
the
missions
the
people
of
asuncion
assembled
troops
to
take
him
from
his
sanctuary
by
force
arrived
upon
the
frontier
of
the
jesuit
territory
they
found
themselves
opposed
by
an
army
of
the
indians
who
looked
so
formidable
that
the
troops
retired
to
asuncion
and
the
leaders
foiled
in
the
field
and
not
having
force
to
attack
the
jesuits
in
their
own
territory
set
vigorously
to
inflame
the
minds
of
the
people
against
them
liberty
is
commonly
only
attained
by
blood
it
is
i
think
quite
legitimate
in
playing
the
liberty
game
to
kill
all
who
disagree
with
your
party
or
to
banish
them
in
these
degenerate
times
lovers
of
liberty
have
to
stop
short
at
calumny
just
as
if
they
were
mere
tyrants
they
worked
with
such
success
that
when
in
the
news
of
antequera
death
reached
paraguay
the
people
inflamed
with
the
idea
that
he
was
sacrificed
to
the
hatred
of
the
jesuits
rose
and
expelled
them
once
again
the
constant
expulsions
of
the
jesuits
from
asuncion
the
turmoils
in
the
state
and
the
fact
that
every
now
and
then
the
indians
had
to
take
arms
to
defend
their
territory

most
mischievously

found
himself
at

the

the

notwithstanding
this
the

incessantly
and
not
without
success

of

perhaps
displays
the

their
best
more
than
their
efforts
in

the
enormous
territory
was
sparsely
peopled
by
about
seventy
tribes
whereof
there
were
fifteen
or
sixteen
of
considerable
size
hardly
two
tribes
spoke
dialects
by
which
they
could
communicate
with
one
another
and
almost
every
one
of
them
lived
in
a
state
of
warfare
not
only
with
the
spaniards
but
with
the
neighbouring
tribes

the

its
rough

without

with

narrow
openings

the

crept

inside
of

contained
five
or
six
rough
rooms
almost
unfurnished
but
for
a
few
religious
books
and
a
plentiful
supply
of
guns
their
beds
were
of
unvarnished
wood
with
curtains
of
rough
cotton
spun
by

they
had
a

of
leather
slung
between

stakes
a

your

something
more

the

they
all

crafty

for

hidden
purpose
of
a
machiavelian
nature
even
a
dominican
will
scarcely
urge
that
they
did
good
more
or
less
good
than
protestant
fanatics
of
the
same
kidney
might
have
achieved
it
were
invidious
to
inquire
that
which
is
certain
is
that
they
were
men
faithful
unto
the
end
to
what
they
thought
was
right
faithful
even
to
the
shedding
of
their
own
blood
which
is
one
may
believe
the
way
in
which
the
scriptural
injunction
should
be
rightly
read
in
the
dim
future
when
some
shadow
of
dawns
on
the
world
and
when
men
recognise
that
it
is
better
to
let
others
follow
their
destiny
as
it
best
pleases
them
without
the
officious
interference
of
their
fellows
it
may
be
that
they
will
say
all
missionaries
of
whatsoever
sect
or
congregation
should
have
stayed
at
home
and
not
gone
gadding
to
the
desert
places
of
the
earth
seeking
to
remedy
the
errors
of
their
god
by
their
exertions
but
whilst
the
ideal
still
remains
of
sacrifice
which
may
for
all
i
know
be
useless
in
itself
or
even
harmful
they
must
perforce
allow
the
jesuits
in
paraguay
high
rank
or
else
be
stultified
but
in
the
chaco
the
jesuits
found
conditions
most
different
from
those
prevailing
in
their
missions
between
the
uruguay
and
parana
instead
of
open
plains
vast
swamps
instead
of
docile
like
the
guaranis
who
almost
worshipped
them
fierce
nomad
horsemen
broken
into
a
hundred
little
tribes
always
at
war
and
caring
little
for
religion
of
any
sort
or
kind
again
there
seems
in
the
chaco
to
have
been
no
means
of
amassing
any
kind
of
wealth
as
all
the
territory
was
quite
uncultivated
and
in
a
virgin
state
but
still
the
settlements
had
existed
long
enough
for
cattle
to
increase
lastly
the
incursions
of
the
barbarous
tribes
were
a
constant
menace
both
to
the
jesuits
and
their
neophytes
yet
in
their
indefatigable
way
the
jesuits
made
considerable
progress
amongst
the
chaco
tribes
as
both
the
curious
of
the
abipones
by
father
dobrizhoffer
and
the
inventories

certainly
he
was
one
of
the
jesuits
who
understood
the
indians
best
and
his
descriptions
of
them
and
their
life
are
among
the
most
delightful
which
have
been
preserved
he
tells
of
the
romantic
but
fruitless
search
during
eighteen
months
throughout
the
forests
of
the
taruma
by
fathers
yegros
escandon
villagarcia
and
rodriguez
for
the
itatines
who
had
left
the
reduction
of
nuestra
senora
de
santa
fe
and
had
hidden
in
the
woods
though
was
the
date
of
the
final
founding
of
these
reductions
as
early
as
about
four
hundred
indians
were
discovered
in
the
woods
of
the
taruma
by
fathers
robles
and
ximenes
and
established
in
the
mission
of
nuestra
senora
de
fe
but
in
the
year
they
all
returned
to
the
woods
a
famine
and
an
outbreak
of
the
having
frightened
them
after
being
again
established
in
a
mission
and
again
having
left
it
in
they
were
established
definitely
at
san
joaquin
dobrizhoffer
calls
the
tobatines
by
the
name
of
itatines
charlevoix
and
others
refer
to
them
as
tobatines
then
commenting
upon
the
strangeness
of
all
affairs
sublunary
he
relates
that
accident
at
length
effected
what
labour
could
not
do
in
father
sebastian
de
yegros
after
a
search
of
forty
days
came
on
the
indians
as
it
were
directed
by
providence
or
as
we
now
say
accident
he
built
a
town
for
them
and
as
dobrizhoffer
says
them
in
christian
polity
to
the
village
cattle
of
every
kind
were
sent
with
clothes
useful
of
course
to
those
who
had
never
worn
them
axes
and
furniture
and
lastly
a
few
music
masters
without
whose
help
those
who
build
cities
spend
their
toil
in
vain
of
the
abipones
to
the
new
town
in
which
the
priest
remained
eight
years
in
came
don
carlos
morphi
an
irishman
and
governor
of
paraguay
and
having
stayed
five
days
with
dobrizhoffer
departed
marvelling
at
the
accuracy
with
which
the
christians
nuevos
managed
their
their
flageolets
their
violins
and
in
general
all
their
instruments
whether
of
music
or
of
war
modestly
but
with
prolixity
as
befits
a
virtuous
man
the
simple
jesuit
relates
a
special
instance
of
the
way
in
which
he
was
enabled
to
work
both
for
his
own
glory
and
for
the
profit
of
the
lord
not
far
from
san
estanislao
was
situate
the
forest
of
in
which
grew
quantities
of
trees
from
which
the
paraguayan
tea
was
made
to
reach
it
was
a
work
of
pain
and
trouble
for
through
the
woods
a
track
called
a
had
to
be
cut
the
rivers
were
deep
bridgeless
and
had
to
have
branches
strewed
along
the
track
to
give
a
footing
to
the
struggling
mules
in
when
i
visited
the
outskirts
of
this
forest
the
conditions
were
similar
to
those
which
dobrizhoffer
describes
with
the
addition
that
the
depopulation
of
the
country
owing
to
the
recent
long
war
had
allowed
the
tigers
to
multiply
to
an
extraordinary
degree
and
my
guide
and
myself
after
feeding
our
horses
had
to
sleep
alternately
the
waker
holding
the
two
horses
hobbled
and
bridled
an
expedition
having
been
sent
under
a
certain
spaniard
called
villalba
to
collect
came
suddenly
upon
a
deserted
indian
hut
as
they
had
started
quite
unarmed
except
with
knives
and
axes
to
cut
down
the
boughs
a
panic
seized
them
and
instead
of
collecting
any
leaves
they
hurried
back
to
san
estanislao
no
sooner
did
dobrizhoffer
hear
the
news
than
he
set
out
to
find
the
indians
with
a
few
neophytes
upon
his
own
account
having
travelled
the
solitudes
for
eighteen
days
they
came
upon
no
sign
of
indians
and
returned
footsore
and
hungry
improvement
of
our
patience
being
our
sole
recompense
the
whole
operation
of
collecting
and
preparing
the
leaves
of
the
paraguayensis
to
make
the
was
most
curious
bands
of
men
used
to
sally
out
for
a
expedition
either
by
land
with
or
up
one
of
the
rivers
in
boats
which
were
poled
along
against
the
rapid
current
by
crews
of
six
to
twelve
men
arrived
at
the
as
the
forest
was
called
they
built
shelters
after
the
fashion
of
those
in
use
amongst
the
larger
of
the
anthropoid
apes
some
roamed
the
woods
in
search
of
the
proper
trees
the
boughs
of
which
they
cut
down
with
machetes
whilst
others
remained
and
built
a
large
shed
of
canes
called
a
on
this
shed
were
laid
the
bundles
of
boughs
brought
from
the
woods
and
a
large
fire
was
lighted
underneath
during
hours
if
i
remember
rightly
the
toasting
went
on
then
when
sufficiently
dry
the
leaves
were
stripped
from
the
twigs
and
placed
on
a
sort
of
open
space
of
hard
clay
something
like
a
spanish
on
this
they
were
pounded
fine
and
the
powder
rammed
into
bags
this
concluded
the
operations
and
the
was
then
ready
for
the
of
the
market
he
himself
walked
all
the
way
and
barefoot
suffering
neither
i
can
describe
nor
yet
my
reader
credit
the
missionary
calling
has
undergone
considerable
change
since
hardships
which
the
greater
faith
or
stronger
constitutions
of
the
missionaries
of
the
last
century
rendered
endurable
are
now
largely
fallen
out
of
fashion
and
your
missionary
seldom
walks
barefoot
even
in
a
wood
because
to
do
so
would
give
offence
and
bring
discredit
on
the
society
for
which
he
works
though
unsuccessful
in
his
search
that
year
dobrizhoffer
not
daunted
by
his
barefoot
marching
set
out
again
upon
the
gospel
trail
next
spring
after
another
journey
of
some
twenty
days
during
the
whole
course
of
which
it
rained
incessantly
he
came
on
a
community
of
seemingly
quite
happy
sylvans
whom
he
proceeded
to
convert
in
the
first
hut
he
met
with
there
were
eight
doors
and
in
it
dwelt
some
sixty
indians
a
phalanstery
with
hammocks
slung
from
the
rude
beams
in
which
heathen
used
to
sleep
each
separate
family
had
its
own
fire
on
the
hearth
of
which
stood
mugs
and
gourds
and
pots
of
earthenware
naked
and
not
ashamed
savages
and
the
men
wore
upon
their
heads
high
crowns
of
parrot
feathers
for
arms
they
carried
bows
and
arrows
and
the
first
man
dobrizhoffer
saw
was
holding
a
dead
pheasant
in
one
hand
and
in
the
other
a
short
bow
in
the
woods
around
the
phalanstery
was
an
quantity
of
maize
of
fruits
of
divers
sorts
and
of
tobacco
from
the
hives
which
the
wild
bees
make
in
hollow
trees
they
collected
honey
in
large
quantities
which
served
them
at
least
so
dobrizhoffer
says
for
meat
and
drink
alike
their
name
for
the
god
they
worshipped
was
tupa
but
that
god
and
his
commandments
they
care
to
know
but
little
this
sounds
ambiguous
and
would
appear
at
first
sight
as
if
the
confidence
betwixt
the
creators
and
their
god
had
been
but
slight
perhaps
the
ambiguity
may
be
set
down
to
the
who
turned
the
latin
in
which
the
memoirs
first
were
formed
into
the
vulgar
tongue
traditore
as
the
proverb
says
a
thing
remarkable
enough
when
one
considers
how
prone
mankind
is
to
act
differently
was
that
although
the
itatines
knew
an
evil
spirit
under
the
name
of
ana
yet
they
paid
little
adoration
to
him
apparently
content
to
know
as
little
of
him
and
his
laws
as
they
did
of
their
god
those
hapless
harmless
folk
as
innocent
of
god
and
devil
right
and
wrong
and
all
the
other
things
which
by
all
rights
they
should
have
known
as
they
are
said
to
be
implanted
in
the
mind
of
man
no
matter
what
his
state
seem
to
have
lived
quite
happily
in
their
involuntary
sin
but
dobrizhoffer
in
his
simple
faith
and
zeal
for
what
he
thought
was
right
wept
bitter
tears
when
he
thought
upon
their
unregenerate
state
charlevoix
says
in
his
de
la
nouvelle
france
speaking
of
the
indians
in

a

more
people
thought
with
charlevoix
and
not
been
too
anxious
to
draw
savages
incontrovertibly
to
our
sic
and
on
and
left
more
to
time
tems
how
much
misery
might
have
been
saved
and
how
many
interesting
peoples
preserved
for
in
spite
of
the
domination
of
the
race
it
might
have
been
wise
to
leave
other
types
if
only
to
remind
us
of
our
superiority
a
sycophantic
guarani
from
the
reductions
then
took
up
his
parable
and
said
save
ye
brothers
we
are
come
to
visit
you
as
friends
this
is
god
own
minister
and
comes
to
visit
you
and
pray
for
your
estate
an
aged
indian
interrupted
him
saying
he
did
not
want
a
and
that
thomas
in
the
past
had
prayed
sufficiently
as
fruits
of
every
sort
abounded
in
the
land
the
indian
in
his
unsophisticated
way
seems
to
have
thought
the
presence
of
a
priest
acted
but
as
manure
on
the
ground
where
he
abode
but
the
jesuit
almost
as
as
himself
took
it
in
kindliness
and
journeyed
with
the
indian
to
a
large
village
about
three
days
away
arrived
there
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
place
sat
in
a
circle
round
the
missionary
they
appeared
he
says
in
so
much
modesty
and
silence
i
seemed
to
behold
statues
and
not
live
indians
to
awaken
their
attention
he
played
upon
the
viol
and
having
thus
captured
their
ears
began
to
preach
to
them
the
good
priest
probably
believed
all
that
he
said
for
after
dwelling
on
the
perils
of
the
road
he
said
friends
my
errand
is
to
make
you
happy
it
did
not
seem
to
him
that
their
free
life
in
woods
in
which
abounded
maize
fruits
and
tobacco
with
game
of
every
kind
could
possibly
have
induced
content
content
as
christians
know
comes
but
with
faith
and
a
true
knowledge
of
the
dogma
is
above
liberty
kindly
but
he
deplored
their
lot
their
want
of
clothes
their
want
of
interest
in
their
god
their
lack
of
knowledge
of
that
god
commands
then
coming
to
the
point
he
spoke
of
hell
and
told
the
astonished
indians
that
it
was
quite
impossible
for
them
to
avoid
its
flames
unless
taught
by
a
priest
they
came
to
know
god
law
he
then
briefly
as
he
says
explained
the
mysteries
of
our
faith
they
listened
rapt
except
that
boys
laughed
a
little
when
he
spoke
of
hell
nothing
more
painful
than
to
see
a
child
laughing
unconscious
of
its
peril
in
the
traffic
of
a
crowded
street
and
we
may
well
believe
that
the
dobrizhoffer
shuddered
at
the
laughter
of
these
children
when
he
reflected
that
had
he
taken
the
wrong
path
crossing
the
marshes
or
in
the
woods
the
laughers
had
been
damned
much
more
he
said
to
them
after
exhausting
hell
and
to
to
his
oration
presented
each
of
them
with
scissors
knives
glass
beads
axes
small
and
for
he
knew
well
that
sermons
which
end
in
me
have
but
a
small
effect
hell
not
infrequently
seems
to
have
struck
the
indians
as
a
joke
for
charlevoix
relates
that
when
the
first
missionaries
expatiated
on
its
flames
to
the
chirignanos
they
said
there
is
fire
in
hell
we
could
soon
get
enough
water
to
put
it
out
this
answer
scandalized
the
good
priest
who
could
not
foresee
that
the
flames
of
tophet
would
be
extinguished
without
the
necessity
of
any
other
waters
than
those
of
indifference
he
says
himself
quite
frankly
seemed
to
have
borne
down
all
before
me
because
i
had
mingled
my
oration
with
a
copious
largess
glass
beads
and
have
from
the
time
when
the
first
christian
missionary
preached
to
the
indians
been
potent
factors
in
conversion
and
still
do
yeoman
service
in
the
great
work
of
bringing
souls
to
god
of
the
abipones
seated
around
the
fire
tobacco
through
a
reed
and
pondering
perchance
over
the
mysteries
of
the
new
expounded
faith
the
of
the
itatines
took
up
his
parable
have
said
he
an
affection
for
the
and
hope
to
enjoy
his
company
throughout
my
life
my
daughter
is
the
prettiest
girl
in
the
whole
world
and
i
am
now
resolved
to
give
her
to
the
that
he
may
always
stay
with
me
and
with
my
family
here
in
the
woods
the
indians
from
the
missions
broke
into
laughter
after
the
fashion
of
all
those
who
knowing
but
a
little
think
that
they
are
wise
the
who
knew
nothing
was
astounded
that
any
man
no
matter
what
his
calling
could
live
without
a
wife
and
asked
the
jesuit
if
the
strange
thing
was
true
his
doubts
being
satisfied
they
fell
discoursing
on
the
nature
of
the
deity
a
subject
not
easy
of
exhaustion
and
difficult
to
treat
of
through
the
medium
of
an
interpreter
know
the
said
there
is
someone
who
dwells
in
heaven
this
vagueness
put
the
missionary
upon
his
mettle
and
he
set
out
at
once
to
expatiate
upon
the
attributes
of
god
they
seemed
to
please
the
who
inquired
is
it
that
displeases
then
the
dweller
in
the
skies
lies
calumnies
adulteries
thefts
all
were
enumerated
and
received
the
indian
assent
but
the
injunction
not
to
kill
provoked
a
bystander
to
ask
if
it
was
not
permitted
to
a
man
to
slay
those
who
attacked
his
life
he
added
have
endeavoured
so
to
do
since
the
first
day
i
carried
arms
casuist
is
a
stout
argument
in
the
mouth
of
a
man
nurtured
upon
suarez
and
molina
but
no
doubt
it
did
good
service
and
dobrizhoffer
uses
it
when
speaking
of
the
chief
but
dobrizhoffer
did
better
work
than
mere
theological
disputation
for
he
prevailed
upon
eighteen
of
the
indians
to
accompany
him
to
the
settlement
of
san
joaquin
and
after
having
some
months
tried
the
constancy
of
a
youth
called
arapotiyu
he
admitted
him
to
the
sacrament
of
baptism
and
long
afterwards
united
him
in
marriage
according
to
the
christian
rites
it
is
evident
that
baptism
should
precede
marriage
but
it
is
an
open
question
as
to
the
duration
of
the
interval
between
the
two
ceremonies
and
we
may
be
permitted
to
wonder
whether
after
all
both
might
not
be
advantageously
dispensed
at
the
same
time
in
the
case
of
arapotiyu
the
system
worked
satisfactorily
for
he
in
every
kind
of
virtue
and
might
have
been
taken
for
an
old
disciple
of
christianity
even
christians
occasionally
despite
their
more
laborious
induction
into
the
rites
and
customs
of
their
faith
have
fallen
from
grace
perhaps
from
the
undue
prolongation
of
the
term
between
the
ceremonies
in
the
case
of
another
youth
one
gato
things
did
not
go
so
smoothly
for
though
he
too
by
his
conduct
obtained
both
baptism
and
christian
wedlock
dobrizhoffer
adds
without
comment
many
months
after
he
died
of
a
slow
disease
the
slow
disease
was
not
improbably
the
nostalgia
of
the
woods
from
which
the
efforts
of
the
good
missionary
had
so
successfully
withdrawn
him
padre
del
techo
in
his
of
paraguay
says
of
the
wood
indians
that
died
like
plants
which
grown
in
the
shade
will
not
bear
the
sun
the
labours
of
the
jesuits
in
the
three
isolated
missions
in
the
north
of
seem
to
have
been
as
successful
as
those
in
the
chaco
were
unfortunate
in
dealing
with
the
wild
equestrian
tribes
of
the
gran
chaco
the
system
of
the
jesuits
was
not
so
likely
to
achieve
success
as
amongst
the
peaceful
guaranis
that
of
the
spanish
settlers
was
entirely
ineffectual
and
has
remained
so
down
to
the
present
day
when
still
the
shattered
remnants
of
the
lules
lenguas
mocobios
and
the
rest
roam
on
their
horses
or
in
their
canoes
about
the
chaco
and
its
rivers
having
received
no
other
benefits
from

although

those
together
with

his

for

of

thus
at

to
secure
a
country
rich
in

and
to
adjust
the
frontier
at
the
river

nothing
appears
so
simple
to
a
statesman
as
to
exchange
one
piece
of
territory
for
another
a
parchment
signed
after
some
international
negotiations
and
the
whole
thing
is
done
if
though
as
happened
in
this
case
one
of
the
territories
contains
a
population
such
as
that
which
inhabited
the
seven
towns
upon
the
uruguay
and
which
has
conquered
the
country
in
which
it
lives
from
virgin
forest
and
defended
it
against
all
comers
it
sometimes
happens
that
the
unreasonable
inhabitants
by
clinging
to
their
homes
defeat
the
statesmen
plans
yet
statesmen
once
embarked
in
any
plan
do
not
stick
at
such
trifles
as
the
affection
of
a
people
for
its
home
but
quietly
pursue
their
path
knowing
that
that
which
is
conceived
by
ministers
of
state
must
in
the
end
be
beneficial
to
mankind
without
this
patriotic
abnegation
of
their
feelings
no
statesmen
would
be
worthy
of
the
name
indifference
to
the
feelings
of
others
is
perhaps
the
greatest
proof
a
public
man
can
give
of
his
attachment
to
the
state
after
negotiations
lasting
many
years
in
a
treaty
was
signed
between
portugal
and
spain
agreeing
that
the
former
should
give
up
the

to

according
to
the
edition
of
the
catholic
encyclopedia
in
the
article
titled
reductions
of
paraguay
this
treaty
signed
in
secret
on
january
was
a
deliberate
assault
on
the
jesuit
order
by
the
ministers
of
spain
and
portugal
the
latter
of
whom
pombal
is
said
to
have
been
responsible
also
for
the
false
and
libelous
de
nicolas
roy
du
paraguai
et
empereur
des
mamalus
referred
to
in
this
chapter
which
was
distributed
throughout
europe
as
another
attack
on
the
jesuits
as
anyone
familiar
with
the
situation
could
see
that
the
indians
would
not
be
happy
about
the
treaty
requirement
to
abandon
their
homes
it
was
a
though
detestable
move
at
that
date
francois
retz
was
general
of
the
jesuits
and
on
him
devolved
the
duty
of
communicating
the
orders
of
the
courts
of
spain
and
portugal
to
the
jesuits
in
the
missions
of
the
uruguay
father
bernard
neyderdorffer
was
the
man
on
whom
the
provincial
of
paraguay
father
barreda
imposed
the
task
of
communicating
to
the
indians
the
wishes
of
the
two
courts
though
he
had
lived
already
years
in
the
missions
and
knew
the
indians
well
and
was
respected
by
them
as
a
father
he
seems
at
first
to
have
shrunk
from
such
a
task
when
the
news
was
brought
to
the
towns
upon
the
uruguay
none
of
the
indians
at
first
would
credit
it
the
chiefs
of
the
seven
towns
declared
that
they
would
rather
die
than
leave
their
native
place
nothing
was
heard
but
lamentations
and
expressions
of
hatred
of
the
portuguese
mingled
with
denunciations
of
the
jesuits
themselves
who
the
poor
indians
not
unnaturally
believed
were
in
league
with
spain
to
sell
them
to
the
portuguese
but
in
a
little
the
clamours
turned
to
action
and
not
content
with
refusing
to
obey
the
edict
of
the
two
courts
the
indians
broke
into
revolt
two
most
important
narratives
of
this
revolt
exist
one
by
father
cardiel
and
one
by
father
ennis
both
of
whom
were
witnesses
of
the
events
after
considerable
negotiations
which
lasted
till
the
united
troops
of
portugal
and
spain
advanced
into
the
mission
territory
to
arrange
the
occupation
of
the
ceded
towns
the
commissioners
of
the
two
nations
were
for
spain
the
marques
de
valdelirios
and
for
portugal
general
gomez
freyre
de
andrade
and
both
of
them
appear
to
have
come
to
america
already
prejudiced
against
the
jesuits
on
march
andrade
wrote
to
valdelirios
almost
before
he
could
have
heard
anything
definite
about
the
mission
territory
to
which
they
both
were
strangers
telling
him
that
opposition
was
to
be
expected
and
that
the
jesuits
were
urging
the
indians
to
revolt
the
opposition
that
the
two
commissioners
so
confidently
hoped
to
find
and
which
contemporary
writers
have
set
forth
in
its
true
colours
as
but
the
revolt
of
ignorant
indians
rendered
desperate
by
being
arbitrarily
dispossessed
of
lands
which
they
themselves
had
settled
and
held
for
almost
a
hundred
years
was
fraught
with
serious
consequences
not
only
to
the
jesuits
in
paraguay
but
to
the
order
throughout
the
world
at
large
for
years
their
enemies
had
said
the
jesuits
were
endeavouring
to
set
up
in
the
missions
a
state
quite
independent
of
the
spanish
crown
by
their
own
conduct
the
jesuits
to
some
extent
had
given
colour
to
the
report
for
by
excluding
in
the
interest
of
the
indians
all
spaniards
from
the
mission
territories
it
looked
as
if
they
were
at
work
at
something
which
they
wished
to
keep
a
secret
as
no
one
at
that
time
deemed
it
a
serious
plea
to
enter
into
any
line
of
conduct
for
the
good
of
indians
whom
in
general
the
spanish
settlers
looked
upon
as
beasts
that
it
was
the
best
policy
they
could
have
possibly
pursued
under
the
circumstances
is
proved
abundantly
by
the
code
of
instructions
laid
down
by
don
francisco
bucareli
the
viceroy
of
buenos
ayres
under
whose
auspices
the
expulsion
of
the
jesuits
in
was
carried
out
in
that
code
occurs

following

any

or

may
be

even
if
they

also
if
any
portuguese

come
to

you
will
instantly
conduct
them
to
this

no
proof
has
ever
been
brought
forward
that
the
jesuits
as
a
body
ever
incited
the
revolt
of
the
indians
though
undoubtedly
father
tadeo
ennis
a
priest
stirred
up
his
own
particular
reduction
to
resist
it
does
not
seem
likely
that
the
jesuits
could
have
thought
it
possible
to
wage
a
successful
war
against
spain
and
portugal
the
dates
taken
from

tally
with
original

from

this
being
so
it
was
evident
that
the
marquis
at
the
date
of
writing
was
of
opinion
that
the
jesuits
were
not
going
to
oppose
the
execution
of

goes

this
refers
to
the
same
subject
and
prohibits
any
spaniard
from
settling
in
an
indian
town
in
any
part
of
america
still
though
their
policy
was
pursued
it
did
not
stop
the
opponents
of
the
jesuits
from
denouncing
that
very
policy
both
at
the
cession
of
the
seven
towns
and
at
the
expulsion
of
the
order
from
america
the
commissioners
after
innumerable
delays
having
found
themselves
in
at
santa
tecla
a
village
near
the
uruguay
it
becomes
necessary
to
cast
a
glance
at
what
the
jesuits
themselves
were
doing
and
how
they
tried
to
do
their
duty
as
they
saw
it
both
to
their
sovereign
their
order
and
the
indians
over
whom
they
ruled
it
seems
as
if
whilst
the
superiors
of
the
order
recognised
at
once
the
futility
of
striving
against
portugal
and
spain
some
of
the
inferior
members
secretly
set
on
the
indians
to
armed
resistance
to
the
impolitic
decree
the
council
of
the
province
paraguay
assembled
at
the
jesuit
college
in
cordoba
composed
of
fathers
masala
horos
caballero
lopez
and
lozano
sent
a
both
to
the
viceroy
of
peru
and
to
the
high
court
of
charcas
in
the
memorial
they
first
set
forth
their
loyalty
and
then
exposed
the
deceit
to
which
the
ministers
of
spain
and
portugal
had
been
subjected
by
their
advisers
in
america
they
pointed
out
most
justly
that
the
treaty
was
damaging
to
both
the
countries
concerned
and
that
in
regard
to
the
indians
of
the
seven
towns
peculiarly
unjust
both
at
charcas
and
at
lima
their
memorial
though
diffuse
was
favourably
received
and
a
copy
remitted
to
the
king
and
council
at
madrid
ibanez
in
his
jesuitica
qualifies
the
action
of
the
jesuits
in
this
matter
as
a
crime
dean
funes
only
sees
duplicity
of
language
but
seems
to
excuse
it
in
the
circumstances
in
which
the
jesuits
were
placed
certainly
after
efforts
extending
over
almost
two
hundred
years
it
was
hard
on
them
to
see
seven
of
their
most
flourishing
missions
arbitrarily
broken
up
the
indians
driven
from
their
homes
and
their
territory
occupied
by
those
very
portuguese
who
for
a
hundred
years
had
been
their
persecutors
there
was
much
to
say
in
extenuation
even
for
of
language
when
one
remembers
that
the
jesuits
alone
no
matter
how
mistaken
their
views
of
treatment
may
seem
to
modern
eyes
stood
out
against
the
assumption
that
the
indians
were
a
mere
flock
of
sheep
who
might
be
driven
from
their
homes
on
any
pretext
or
at
the
exigencies
of
ministers
at
courts
who
lived
ten
thousand
miles
away
and
were
completely
ignorant
of
the
local
circumstances
whether
the
memorial
influenced
the
court
of
spain
is
hard
to
say
but
it
is
certain
that
when
in
the
marques
de
valdelirios
arrived
in
buenos
ayres
with
him
came
as
a
commissioner
to
fix
the
boundary
between
the
two
nations
of
the
uruguay
father
luis
de
altamirano
accompanied
by
his
secretary
rafael
de

both
members
of
the
order
and
that
the
marquis
took
up
his
lodging
in
the
college
of
the
jesuits
there
papers
and
memorials
rained
on
him
one
came
from
the
bishop
of
tucuman
and
one
from

the
governor
of

with
many

inferior
note
all
in
the
interest
of
the
company
it
appears
as
if
valdelirios
thought
that
these
memorials
were
inspired
for
his
first
action
was
to
publish
to
the
priests
of
the
seven
towns
the
wishes
of
his
government
as
to
evacuation
by
the
indians
of
the
territory
this
he
did
through
the
prefect
of
the
missions
who
seems
to
have
acted
in
good
faith
in
his
endeavours
to
carry
out
the
wishes
of
the
spanish
court
just
at
that
moment
barreda
the
provincial
of
paraguay
arrived
in
buenos
ayres
and
valdelirios
asked
him
his
opinion
as
to
the
measures
best
calculated
to
insure
the
treaty
being
quietly
carried
out
barreda
though
all
his
interests
were
against
the
execution
of
the
treaty
seems
to
have
acted
in
good
faith
he
gave
the
sensible
advice
that
as
the
treaty
had
been
made
entirely
without
taking
into
consideration
the
difficulties
of
carrying
it
out
it
could
not
be
held
a
crime
to
ask
the
king
for
some
delay
he
advised
consulting
three
of
paraguay
who
happened
to
be
in
buenos
ayres
and
lastly
that
all
hurry
or
anything
likely
to
excite
the
indians
should
be
avoided
for
it
was
possible
that
they
relying
on
their
numbers
and
local
knowledge
might
be
able
to
give
much
trouble
even
to
the
joint
forces
of
both
crowns
he
laid
before
valdelirios
the
condition
of
the
reductions
telling
him
that
they
were
fertile
and
well
cultivated
and
that
this
of
itself
would
incline
the
indians
against
migrating
from
their
lands
lastly
he
said
it
was
the
opinion
of
the
most
experienced
of
the
priests
that
the
indians
would
yield
neither
to
arguments
nor
reason
for
the
hatred
of
the
portuguese
had
put
them
quite
beside
themselves
with
fury
at
the
idea
of
giving
up
their
lands
valdelirios
must
have
found
himself
not
in
too
comfortable
a
state
lodged
as
he
was
in
the
college
of
the
jesuits
he
must
have
felt
that
most
of
the
advice
which
was
so
freely
tendered
him
was
biassed
and
to
relieve
his
mind
he
called
a
council
at
which
the
provincial
barreda
juan
escadon
his
secretary
altamirano
and
rafael
de
cordoba
appeared
the
council
recommended
prudence
and
as
the
majority
were
jesuits
pushed
their
prudence
even
beyond
lowland
scotch
or
north
of
ireland
limits
for
they
proposed
to
institute
a
commission
which
after
three
years

should
report
at

they

it
is
most
likely
that
if
altamirano
had
no
secret
understanding
with
his
brother
jesuits
his
letters
must
have
considerably
amazed
them
and
certainly
they
gave
offence
to
the
indians
who
declared
he
could
not
be
a
jesuit
at
all
six
hundred
indians
under
a
chief
called
sepe
tyaragu
marched
upon

altamirano
had
taken
up
his
residence
with
the
avowed
purpose
of
discussing
whether
he
was
a
jesuit
or
not
and
if
the
latter
supposition
proved
correct
of
throwing
him
into

did
not

that

the

seem
to
have
been
as
bad
as
those
which
produced
the
historical
exclamation
dura
tellus

it
is
certainly
the
case
that
ibanez
in
his
jesuitica
madrid
gives
a
very
different
version
of
the
doings
of
altamirano
for
he
says
that
rafael
de
cordoba
altamirano
secretary
in
a
schooner
called
a
great
quantity
of
guns
and
lead
for
balls
packing
them
all
in
boxes
which
he
said
were
full
of
objects
of
a
pious
nature
this
says
ibanez
told
me
by
the
master
of
the
schooner
el
ingles
a
man
worthy
of
credence
this
is
pleasing
to
national
pride
but
still
one
seems
to
want
a
little
better
authority
even
than
that
of
the
englishman

curious

tell
him
that
michael

showed
their
poor

where
to
plant
a
cross
and
afterwards
to
march
due
south
from
the
cross
and
they
would
find
a
holy
father
of
the
company
this
of
course
turned
out
as
the
saint
had
foretold
and
after
a
long
day
march
they
encountered
the
jesuit
and
became
christians
this
account
seems
to
have
been
lost
and
a
careful
search
has
not
disinterred
it
from
the
maelstrom
of
simancas
that
of
so
many
documents
without
whose
aid
so
much
of
spanish
history
can
not
be
written
historians
like
lawyers
in
conveyancing
catch
errors
one
from
another
and
transmit
them
as
truths
or
titles
to
posterity
certain
it
is
that
echevarria
sent
for
the
nearest
jesuit
priest
to
mediate
and
he
luckily
or
unluckily
proved
to
be
that
father
thadeus
ennis
who
played
so
prominent
a
part
in
the
futile
rising
which
the
enemies
of
the
jesuits
have
chosen
to
dignify
with
the
title
of
the
war
if
father
ennis
really
thought
the
indians
could
hold
head
to
both
the
spaniards
and
the
portuguese
or
if
he
thought
that
the
rising
would
draw
attention
to
the
injustice
of
the
treaty
is
difficult
to
say
whether
indeed
he
headed
it
himself
or
if
he
merely
accompanied
the
indians
as
their
spiritual
guide
giving
them
now
and
then
the
benefit
of
his
advice
on
matters
temporal
after
the
fashion
of
the
ambitious
churchman
of
all
time
is
now
unknown
whatever
his
opinions
were
upon
this
matter
father
ennis
showed
himself
almost
from
the
first
irreconcilable
he
refused
to
meet
the
commissioners
and
in
his
place
sent
a
chief
of
the
indians
one
sepe
tyaragu
an
official
of
the
reduction
of
san
miguel
this
chief
seeing
the
escort
of
the
commission
was
but
small
on
his
boots
and
took
high
ground
daring
to
talk
about
the
rights
of
man
of
the
love
of
country
and
said
that
liberty
consisted
in
being
allowed
to
enjoy
his
property
in
peace
sentiments
which
though
admirable
enough
in
a
white

offensive
tone

the
had
such

on
the
commissioners
that
after
having
threatened
him
with
vengeance
which
at
the
time
they
had
no
power
to
carry
out
they
both
withdrew
out
of
the
territory
as
well
observes
the
spaniards
had
established
themselves
in
these
parts
the
river
plate
and
paraguay
to
obtain
a
limitless
submission
from
the
indians
any
resistance
drove
them
to
fury
and
excited
them
to
take
revenge
as
all
the
indians
crime
was
their
unwillingness
to
quit
the
lands
on
which
they
had
been
born
it
seemed
a
little
hard
to
slaughter
them
even
before
their

what
took
place
after

skirmishes

at

were
favourable
to
the

took
great
courage
from
them

a

nature

on

quite
naturally
the
victory
was
on

side

ago
were
to
the
full
as
interminable
as
that
of
troy
father
thadeus
ennis
kept
his
journal
faithfully
chronicling
all
that
he
saw
occasionally
in
a
perfunctory
way
he
says
his
mission
with
the
revolted
indians
was
as
a
priest
and
physician
to
the
souls
and
bodies
of
his
flock
but
now
and
then
he
sets
down
the
capture
of
a
convoy
of
some
thirty
carts
or
the
cutting
off
some
messenger
carrying
despatches
from
the
generals
in
this
he
sees
the
hand
of
god
put
forth
to
help
his
although
he
now
and
then
complains
the
indians
were
remiss
in
following
up
any
success
they
had
after
the
first
encounter
the
indians
seem
to
have
employed
the
immemorial
guerilla
tactics
which
so
often
waste
all
the
strength
of
an
army
which
has
conquered
in
the
field
father
describes
the
indian
army
quoting
from
the
writing
of
a
spanish
officer
who
served
against
them
as
quite
contemptible
their
cannon
were
but
hollow
reeds
bound
round
with
hide
which
could
only
be
fired
two
or
three
times
and
carried
balls
a
pound
in
weight
some
lances
and
bows
and
arrows
which
they
had
appeared
to
him
more
formidable
most
of
them
carried
banners
with
the
painted
figure
of
a
saint
under
whose
aegis
they
deemed
themselves
secure
from
their
trenches
were
but
shallow
ditches
with
a
few
deeper
holes
to
shelter
in
but
which
as
cardiel
observes
served
many
of
them
for
graves
as
they
were
open
to
artillery
having
been
constructed
without
ounce
of
military
art
the
officer
adds
that
no
sooner
had
the
indians
heard
the
cannon
than
they
fled
leaving
almost
nine
hundred
on
the
field
and
losing
prisoners
finally
the
officer
remarks
with
disgust
that
the
official
chronicler
of
the
affair
from
first
to
when
he
declares
that
the
indians
could
make
any
resistance
against
disciplined
troops
with
varying
fortune
the
campaign
dragged
on
until
in
the
diary
of
father
ennis
bad
latinity
and
all
comes
to
an
abrupt
conclusion
at
the
taking
of
san
lorenzo
where
the
priest
was
taken
prisoner
his
papers
fell
into
unfriendly
hands
and
were
made
use
of
by
ibanez
with
the
context
duly
distorted
in
various
passages
and
served
as
one
of
the
most
formidable
indictments
against
the
jesuits
in
the
expulsion
under
charles

about

sprang

one

the

the
bitterest
enemies
of
everything
paraguayan
so
that
a

had
as
well
been

of

if
this

it
is
not

one
of
the
few

published
there
in

if
not
the
only
one
happy
is

naturally

to
look
on

promising
to
give

more
of

against
the

in
paraguay
father
dobrizhoffer
who
knew
nicolas
from
his
youth
up
has
left
a
very
different
version
of
his
history
in
which
no
donna
della
cupidita
or
de
la
victoria
even
remotely
flourishes
nicolas
neenguiru
was
born
in
the
township
of
la
concepcion
of
which
in
he
rose
to
be
the
mayor
he
married
an
indian
woman
not
belle
andalouse
and
dobrizhoffer
says
a
friend
of
his
one
father
zierheim
had
him
whipped
publicly
for
petty
theft
when
a
young
man
at
the
time
when
in
company
with
another
indian
one
jose
mayor
of
san
miguel
he
headed
the
indian
revolt
he
was
a
man
of
middle
age
tall
taciturn
and
grave
and
not
though
marked
across
the
cheek
with
a
disfiguring
scar
at
no
time
was
he
even
a
lay
brother
of
the
jesuit
order
as
by
their
rules
in
paraguay
no
indians
were
ever
taken
either
as
lay
brothers
or
as
priests
so
little
was
the
man
feared
by
the
authorities
that
once
the
indians
resistance
was
over
nicolas
went
to
the
spanish
camp
was
quietly
heard
dismissed
and
then
continued
in
his
office
as
the
mayor
of
his
native
place
the
legend
sprang
from
a
mistake
in
guarani
to
which
perhaps
a
little
malice
gave
its
artful
charm
in
guarani
the
word
signifies
a
chief
whereas
means
king
the
two
pronounced
by
one
but
ill
acquainted
with
the
language
sound
identical
nothing
was
more
likely
than
that
the
indians
should
call
their
general
their
chief
had
they
thought
really
of
settling
upon
a
king
it
is
certain
that
they
would
have
chosen
one
of
the
family
of
some
chief
and
not
an
indian
merely
appointed
mayor
by
the
jesuits
but
be
that
as
it
may
general
neenguiru
though
he
has
left
some
interesting
letters
which
are
preserved
in
the
archives
of
simancas
showed
no
capacity
for
generalship
throughout
the
course
of
the
campaign
he
endeavoured
to
replace
his
want
of
skill
by
tricks
and
by
intrigues
but
of
so
futile
a
nature
that
they
were
frustrated
and
rendered
useless
at
once
his
first
endeavour
was
to
gain
time
when
he
found
himself
with
seventeen
hundred
men
opposed
to
andonaegui
governor
of
buenos
ayres
who
had
an
army
well
equipped
with
guns
of
about
two
thousand
men
neenguiru
wrote
to
andonaegui
telling
him
that
the
indians
were
ready
to
submit
and
then
whilst
waiting
for
an
answer
set
about
fortifying
the
position
which
he
held
warned
by
a
spy
andonaegui
attacked
at
once
and
drove
the
indians
from
their
trenches
like
a
flock
of
sheep
taking
their
wooden
cannon
lances
and
banners
and
killing
thirteen
hundred
of
them
of
the
abipones
vol
the
only
man
the
indians
produced
who
showed
any
aptitude
as
a
leader
was
a
chief
called
sepe
tyaragu
at
his
death
in
action
in
nicolas
neenguiru
succeeded
to
his
post
a
glorious
victory
and
as
father
ennis
says
be
expected
and
which
had
it
chanced
otherwise
must
have
covered
the
spaniards
and
the
portuguese
with
shame
in
fact
a
victory
of
the
same
kind
as
those
which
since
that
time
have
been
most
usual
when
european
troops
have
faced
savages
but
which
of
course
reflect
no
credit
on
the
victor
or
at
best
just
as
much
credit
as
a
butcher
rightfully
receives
when
he
defeats
a
calf
but
even
after
the
victory
over
the
indians
of
nicolas
neenguiru
the
troubles
of
the
allies
were
not
quite
at
an
end
the
usual
dissensions
between
allies
who
mutually
detest
each
other
soon
broke
out
and
gomez

the
general
of
the
portuguese
only
prevented
a
collision
with
the
spaniards
by
considerable
tact
after
a
short
campaign
of
a
few
months
the
allies
entered
the
rebellious
towns
and
took
possession
of
them
all
with
the
exception
of
san
lorenzo
which
continued
to
hold
out
a
month
or
two
served
to
reduce
it
too
and
the
whole

of
the
seven
towns

to

it
thus
the

has
received
its
present

name
most
of
the
seven
towns
were
half
deserted
the
indians
having
fled
for
refuge
to
the
woods
and
the

set
to

sent

telling

to
burn

destroy

pull
down

even

would
not

they
go
on
to

they

that
it

take
the

their
knowledge

the
country

the
vast
influence
that
they
had
upon

would
have
made
the

perilous
enough
even
for
the
united

portugal

as
it
was
the
miserable

dragged
on

long

result

were

this
dangerous
state
of
calm
without
an
apparent
enemy
in
sight
was
the
position
of
the
jesuits
in
paraguay
in
by
desperate
efforts
and
intrigues
in
spain
they
had
kept
their
thirty
missions
from
being
mutilated
their
influence
amongst
the
indians
had
never
been
more
absolute
the
governors
of
buenos
ayres
and
of
paraguay
had
tried
a
fall
with
them
and
the
honours
of
the
struggle
were
with

they
had
succeeded
in
getting

into

the
clauses
of
the
of
the

kept
spaniards
out

been
forced
to
testify
to
their
in
paraguay
but
throughout
spain
and
her
enormous
empire
in
america
and
in
the
east
perpetual
hostility
between
the
jesuits
and
the
regular
clergy
had
been
going
on
for
years
in
every
portion
of
america
the
jesuits
were
unpopular
the
excuse
alleged
being
their
wealth
and
power
but
the
real
reason
was
their
attitude
on
slavery
after
repeated
grumblings
of
distant
thunder
at
length
the
storm
broke
and
the
decree
for
the
expulsion
of
the
jesuits
in
spain
and
her
dominions
was
signed
and
the
order
sent
to
bucareli

put
it
into

reasons
which
induced
king
charles
iii
to
expel
the
jesuits
mysterious
as
they
were
and
locked
up
a
dead
secret
in
the
royal
breast
may
or
may
not
have
been
sufficient
in
spain
but
could
in
no
respect
have
held
good
for
paraguay
where
there
existed
little
scope
for
court
intrigue
and
where
the
jesuits
were
far
removed
from
their
fellow
spanish
subjects
and
occupied
entirely
with
their
mission
work
many
and
various
have
been
the
explanations
which
historians
have
set
forth
for
this
decree
certain
it
is
in
spain
this
order
had
attained
to
considerable
power
and
that
in
rome
the
abler
of
their
generals
occasionally
kept
the
popes
in
mental
servitude

himself

a

he
says

the
figures
in

serve
to
show
that
in
paraguay
at
least
they
were
not
exactly
millionaires
in

palafox
the

of

had
set

no
doubt
carlos
iii
satisfied
his
conscience
with
this
dictum
but
it
is
permissible
to
doubt
whether
the
power
alluded
to
in
such
a
manner
by
the
king
was
equally
satisfied
some
have
accounted
for
the
act
of
charles
iii
as
being
but
revenge
for
the
tumult
of
aranjuez
under
the
ministry
of
esquilace
arguing
that
the
jesuits
were
in
fact
the
authors
of
it
and
that
it
was
but
the
precursor
of
a
plot
to
dethrone
the
king
and
place
his
brother
don
luis
upon
the
throne
as
being
not
so
liberal
in
his
ideas
others
again
have
that
the
jesuits
set
about
a
calumny
that
charles
iii
was
not
the
queen
son
by
her
husband
but
by
a
lover
whom
they
said
she
had
the
only
reason
which
seems
feasible
is
that
the
king
was
worked
on
by
the
fear
that
the
order
had
risen
to
too
much
power
and
that
if
he
did
not
at
once
take
steps
the
monarchy
would
be
rendered
but
a
mere
appendage
of
the
general
of
the
jesuits
this
celebrated
tumult
generally
known
in
spain
as
motin
de
aranjuez
and
sometimes
as
motin
de
esquilace
occurred
on
palm
sunday
the
ostensible
reason
was
an
edict
of
the
king
charles
iii
prohibiting
the
use
of
long
cloaks
and
hats
which
had
been
for
long
popular
in
spain
the
tumult
assumed
such
formidable
dimensions
that
the
walloon
guards
were
unable
to
quell
it
but
two
friars
padre
osma
and
padre
cueva
in
some
manner
were
able
to
stem
the
confusion
the
king
and
the
court
were
so
much
disturbed
that
they
quitted
madrid
and
went
to
aranjuez
there
is
no
proof
that
the
jesuits
had
any
hand
at
all
in
the
affair
ferrer
del
rio
in
his
history
of
the
reign
of
charles
iii
such
at
least
several
of
his
letters
to
the
pope
clement
would
seem
to
indicate
it
is
not
impossible
that
the
strenuous
opposition
which
the
jesuits
gave
to
the
inquisition
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
their
expulsion
some
of
them
went
great
lengths
in
their
attacks

asserting
that

by
such
a

its
roots
in

and
that

whether
it
is

of

race
or
sect
or

from
its

no
matter
what

to

effect

they
took

first
expected

their
instigators

the
jesuits

much
of
their
influence
so
that
it
seems
that
persecution

be
effectual

not
stop
on
this
side
of
extermination
and
this

to
whom
the
task
of
the
expulsion
of
the
order
in
the

of
paraguay
was
entrusted
was
no
ordinary
man
appointed
viceroy
of
buenos

after
a
distinguished
career
of
public
service
he
found
himself
almost
without
warning
and
without
any
adequate
forces
at
his
command
obliged
to
execute
by
far
the
most
important
and
task
that
had
ever
fallen
to
the
lot
of
any
spanish
governor
in
america
to
carry
out
but
as
his
services
had
not
been
chiefly
in
america
he
held
the
idea
which
at
the
time
was
generally
received
in
europe
that
the
jesuits
possessed
great
wealth
had
bodies
of
trained
troops
and
so
would
resist
all
efforts

says

he
considered
the

was

have

on

as
all

of

knew
what
had

in

concealment
of
his
plan
became
no

thus
had
the
jesuits
possessed
either
the
wish
or
the
means
to
make
an
armed
resistance
they
had
ample
time
to
stand
on
their
defence
nothing
was
further
from
their
minds

they

a

march
upon

a
suspicion

him
to

precautions

proved
quite
ridiculous
he
sent

to
have

thought

of

having
expelled
the
jesuits
bucareli
was
bound
by
the
exigencies
of
his
position
to
calumniate
them
perhaps
as
an
official
hidebound
in
his
belief
in
the
inalterable
right
of
governments
to
commit
injustices
he
believed
all
that
he
wrote
for
the
welfare
of
humanity
one
could
hope
he
knew
all
that
he
wrote
was
false

quite
unaware

this
war
undertaken
by
a
fool
lopez
against
enormous
odds
served
to
show
what
a
people
even
when
in
the
wrong
and
in
a
bad
cause
can
do
when
it
believes
itself
to
be
fighting
for
national
liberty
as
a
matter
of
fact
paraguayan
liberty
was
not
threatened
for
an
instant
and
lopez
declared
war
against
both
brazil
and
the
argentine
republic
out
of
mere
ambition
to
be
a
second
napoleon
his
solitary
qualifications
for
the
character
were
that
like
his
prototype
he
was
fat
and
loved
women
the
war
commenced
in
and
finished
in
and
left
the
country
almost
a
desert
so
lonely
was
it
that
i
have
often
in
those
days
seen
tigers

the
name

to

being
more
important

el
jose
pignatelli
in
his

jesus
en
su
extincion
y

says
that
the
paraguayan
jesuits
were
all
sent
to
faenza
but
still
he
had
to
justify
himself
either
upon
his
own
account
or
for
the
benefit
of
that
posterity
to
conciliate
which
so
many
public
men
have
paltered
with
the
truth
so
his
first
care
was
to
extract
a
letter
from
thirty
indians
whom
he
chose
to
dignify
with
the
title
of
the
mayors
of
the
thirty
towns
first
having
as
he
says
himself
in
a
letter
to
the
conde

the
minister
of
charles
dressed
them
in
the
spanish
fashion
and
treated
them
in
such
a
way
that
they
might
know
how
much
their
lot
had
been
improved
the
letter
written
originally
in
guarani
bears
upon
every
line
of
it
the
dictation
of
the
governor
after
a
fine
paragraph
of
salutations
it
goes
on
to
give
the

many
and
repeated

your

all
the
just
orders
which
your
majesty
laid
to
his
charge
aiding
our
poverty
and
clothing
us
like
gentlemen
most
people
even
the
heathen
like
those
who
help
their
poverty
and
clothe
them
in
the
garb
of
gentlemen
it
had
not
occurred
to
the
poor
indians
that
the
fine
clothes
might
turn
out
liveries
the
mayors
all
sign
their
indian
names
which
seems
to
give
the
lie
to
the
accusation
that
the
jesuits
kept
them
ignorant
the
letter
dated
buenos
ayres
march
seems
to
show
that
the
indians

who
they
might
have
been

not

at
the
time
they
wrote

in
which
he
fairly
and
with

reiterates
all
the
old
charges
against
the
jesuits
in
paraguay
which
the
inventive
brain
of
cardenas
had
first
conceived
but
to
them
he
adds
several
little
touches
of
his
own
which

he

of
small
account

so

relates
with
some
prolixity
all
that
he
did
with
comments
movements
of
troops
regrettable
occurrences
as
when
his
soldiers
let
themselves
be
surprised
and
lost
their
horses
and
now
and
then
scraps
of
morality
and
theology
which
shows
quite
plainly
that
the
art
of
writing
maundering
despatches
is
not
so
new
as
optimists
may
have
supposed
quite
in
the
manner
of
a
modern
special
correspondent
he
sets
down
all
that
he
suffered
from
the
weather
that
it
rained
incessantly
and
marvellous
to
tell
that
after
rain
the
rivers
rose
and
gave
him
difficulty
to
cross
the
roads
were
bad
provisions
scarce
and
dear
and
now
and
then
wild
indians
an
outpost
of
his
men
whilst
his
brave
fellows
when
god
willed
it
occasionally
the
infidel
and
by
the
grace
of
heaven
slew
no
small
number
of
them
still
in
the
monstrous
farrago
of
words
extending
to
some
sixteen
pages
of
close
print
he
lets
us
see
he
was
a
man
of
some
capacity
but
leaves
it
doubtful
whether
he
really
thought
he
was
engaged
upon
a
noble
work
or
if
he
wrote
ironically
or
if
his
only
object
was
to
satisfy
his
conscience
and
his
king
but
making
much
of
little
difficulties
is
but
to
be
expected
from
a
leader
of
an
expedition
or
from
a
general
in
the
field
without
it
how
could
they
justify
their
existence
or
prove
to
the
world
at
large
that
they
were
needed
or
but
more
important
than
a
mere
ceremony
brabo

ceremonies
no
doubt
have
their
uses
in
enslaving
mankind
a
courtier
once
said
to
a
spanish
king
majesty
is
but
a
ceremony
yourself
when
the
land
troubles
were
got
over
and
bucareli
having
arrived
at
yapeyu
embarked
upon
the
river
the
very
winds
proved
contrary
so
that
it
took
him
many
days
to
arrive
at
candelaria
which
port
he
reached
upon
august
but
before
quitting
yapeyu
the
governor
made
a
solemn
feast
riding
himself
before
his
grenadiers
whose
caps
he
says
caused
much
amazement
the
indians
never
having
seen
such
headgear
in
their
lives

difficulties
of
his
journey
over
the
jesuits
dispossessed
and
sent
to
be
remitted

bucareli
in
his
letter
next
deals
with
questions
of
religion
about
which
he
shows
himself
as
well
informed
as
all
the
spanish
conquerors
seem
to
have
been
in
the
new
world
if
for
the
dogma
of
the
faith
he
was
a
bar
of
iron
for
morality
as
scottish
preachers
of
the
perfervid
type
used
to
refer
to
it
he
was
most
keen
the
indians
clothes
especially
the
graceful
worn
by
the
women
shocked
him
exceedingly
it
was
impossible
to
touch
upon
it
without
an
outrage
upon
modesty
masculine
virtue
is
a
most
precarious
thing
but
little
if
at
all
more
stable
than
its
female
counterpart
therefore
perhaps
the
governor
was
right
not
to
expose
his
soldiers
to
temptation
so
he
did
well
as
he
informs
us
in
serving
out
clothes
which
obscured
their
charms
or
perhaps
hid
them
quite
from
view

to

the

having

having

light

that

could
not
with
modesty
even
describe

it
might
have
seemed
but
natural
that
he
should
have
evolved
some
system
of
government
differing
in
all
respects
from
that
he
had
destroyed
so
far
from
that
in
his
instructions
to
his
interim
successor
dated
at
candelaria
august
he
practically
followed
slavishly
all
the
policy
which
the
jesuits
had
pursued
he
ordered
captains
riva

and
bruno
de
zavala
to
whom
the
arrangements
were
committed
to
see
that
the
indians
were
instructed
the
true
knowledge
of
our
holy
faith
a
work
which
the
jesuits
whatever
might
be
their
faults
had
not
neglected
to
insure
after
some
platitudes
as
to
the
vivifying
effects
of
free
and
open
trade
and
an
injunction
to
his
captains
to
take
care
the
indian
girls
were
decorously
and
virtuously
dressed
he
launched
into
a
sermon
about
honest
work
which
as
he
said
would
make
the
indians
rich
happy
and
virtuous
and
alone
could
ever
make
a
kingdom
prosper
in
fact
he
used
almost
precisely
similar
language
to
that
used
by
a
european
governor
in
africa
when
about
to
make
a
people
slaves
on
the
whole
however
his
instructions
were
wise
and
liberal
and
had
they
been
carried
out
in
the
same
spirit
and
with
fidelity
the
indians
might
have
long
continued
in
the
same
state
in
which
the
jesuits
left
them
and
to
which
it
seems
they
could
attain
but
not
go
farther
without
exposure
to
that
vivifying
commerce
without
which
nations
can
not
prosper
but
with
which
the
greater
portion
of
their
citizens
must
remain

the
instructions
given
he
left
the
missions
never
to
return
leaving
behind
him
the
reputation
of
an
honest
man
having
made
as
it
would
appear
no
money
during
his
sojourn
in
their
territories
on
october
he
wrote
from
buenos
ayres
to
aranda
telling
him
that
his
work
was
done
and
asking
him
as
a
particular
favour
to
implore
the
king
to
give
him
some
employment
of
america
and
particularly
not
under
either
the
secretaryship
or
the
council
of
the
indies
thus
it
appears
that
either
the
work
in
which
he
had
been
engaged
was
uncongenial
to
him
or
he
mistrusted
the
future
and
the
indians
when
the
jesuits
sheltering
hands
had
been
withdrawn
and
thought
the
king
might
blame
him
for
what
was
sure
to
come
one
passage
in
his
letter
of
instructions
shows
that
the
antique
but
still
current
fashion
of
going
to
any
length
to
obtain
a
country
in
which
are
situated
even
supposititious
had
its
influence
even
with
such
an
honest
man
as
bucareli
was
he
specially
enjoins
upon
the
officials
left
in
charge
find
out
from
what
quarter
the
indians
of
those
towns
extract
those
pieces
of
the
precious
metals
which
they
sometimes
bring
to
their

cardenas
although
a
thousand
times
disproved
still
lingered
in
the
minds
of
those
who
could
not
understand
what
motive
except
that
of
growing
rich
could
cause
the
jesuits
to
bury
themselves
in
the
recesses
of
the
paraguayan
woods
the
release
from
things
american
and
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
council
of
the
indies
did
not
come
to
bucareli
for
almost
two
more
years
during
which
time
he
struggled
manfully
with
the
affairs
of
the
jesuit
missions
repelled
the
chaco
indians
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
implored
for
troops
to
defend
the
island
of
chiloe
against
the
heretic
english
who
at
that
time
appear
to
have
been
meditating
the
advancement
of
their
empire
in
the
extremest

one
curious
letter
was
reserved
for
bucareli
to
indite
before
he
quitted
buenos
ayres
for
the
last
time
on
january
he
sent
a
long
declaration
signed
by
the
celebrated
nicolas
neenguiru
and
other
indians
giving
an
account
of
the
part
played
by
him
in
the
abortive
resistance
which
he
made
against
the
cession
of
the
seven
towns
this
is
the
last
time
that
nicolas
the
of
paraguay
and
of
the
mamelucos
appears
in
any
document
as
far
as
i
can
find
his
name
at
one
time
was
well
known
in
paraguay
the
river
plate
and
spain
and
served
to
father
many
lies
upon
and
at
the
last
the
jesuits
gone
he
seems
to
have
turned
against
them
and
said
all
that
was
required
by
bucareli
to
get
up
his
case
it
appears
from
bucareli
letter
that
the
family
of
the
neenguiru
had
been
well
known
in
the
missions
from
the
time
of
cardenas
in
we
find
him
shorn
of
his
kingly
and
imperial
dignities
the
mayor
of
concepcion
in
paraguay
tall
taciturn
with
long
lank
hair
and
much
respected
by
his
brother
indians
who
held
his
stirrup
for
him
when
he
got
upon
his
horse
to
find
him
in
the
humour
to
give
tongue
about
the
jesuits
was
a
in
bucareli
hand
for
if
it
could
be
proved
that
in
they
had
resisted
the
forces
of
the
crown
of
spain
the
public
always
anxious
to
believe
a
lie
would
naturally
applaud
the
action
of
the
king
in
their
expulsion
from
his
territories
nicolas
who
seems
to
have
been
but
a
poor
creature
at
the
best
testified
that
everything
which
he
had
done
as
general
of
the
indians
was
by
the
order
of
fathers
limp
and
ennis
and
that
he
was
a
poor
indian
who
did
but
that
which
he
was
told
he
finished
up
his
testimony
with
thanks
to
the
good
king
for
having
taken
him
out
of
the
power
of
the
jesuits
and
kept
him
in
his
post
of
mayor
at
concepcion
in
fact
all
was
the
same
to
him
as
long
as
he

those

of

in

i
have

them
with

a

hat
upon
their
heads
a
linen
jacket
and
trousers
and
barefooted
riding

that
they

was
left

in

bucareli
who
seemed
fated
never
to
escape
from
the
affairs
of

sends
a
long
constitution
for
the
thirty
towns
which
follows
all
the
rules
of

to
the
last
tittle
of
their
policy
brabo
has
preserved
the
document
which
runs
to
pages
of
close

in
its
entirety
a
carefully
and
digest
of
a
constitution
it
most
certainly
is
and
yet
it
follows
to
the
most
minute
particular
the
policy
the
jesuits
laid
down
dean
seemed
to
see
that
the
flattering
of
nicolas
neenguiru
and
the
other
indian
chiefs
was
an
entire
affair
of
artifice
and
that
it
was
but
a
mere
crowning
of
the
victims
who
were
destined
to
be
sacrificed
it
may
be
that
the
constitution
made
by
bucareli
at
the
escorial
was
similarly
but
a
blind
to
keep
the
indians
quiet
till
the
government
had
time
to
exploit
them
at
its
ease
still
bucareli
in
all
his
actions
seems
to
have
been
an
honest
man
one
of
those
honest
men
who
have
sown
more
misery
in
the
world
than
all
the
rogues
and
scoundrels
since
the
flood
be
all
that
as
it
may
his
constitution
in
a
thousand
ways
recalled
the
jesuits
polity
in
their
days
of
rule
in
a
former
i
have
pointed
out
a
curious
instance
in
which
this
constitution
traverses
entirely
statements
made
by
the
jesuits
enemies
that
their
exclusive
policy
was
for
their
own
ends
and
not
as
they
alleged
for
the
protection
of
the
indians
but
there
are
other
instances
quite
as
remarkable
which
show
that
the
jesuits
not
only
had
grasped
perfectly
what
the
best
course
of
treatment
was
for
their
subjects
but
that
the
official
mind
of
bucareli
trained
as
he
was
so
to
speak
in
the
strictest
sect
of
pharisees
and
prejudiced
against
the
jesuits
in
every
way
yet
discerned
clearly
as
an
honest
man
that
the
plan
they
had
laid
down
was
the
most
suitable
for
future

chapter
ix
at
the
time
of
forming
his
constitution
he
had
been
gone
but
scarce
a
year
from
buenos
ayres
and
yet
he
complaining
bitterly
of
what
was
happening
in
the
missions
of
paraguay
he
points
out
that
all
his
trouble
will
have
been
in
vain
the
governor
and
his
lieutenants
are
not
stimulated
to
address
themselves
to
the
service
of
god
and
of
the
king
with
that
zeal
which
everyone
should
impart
to
his
duty
then
after
a
puff
preliminary
of
the
beauty
of
freedom
human
and
divine
he
sets
forth
how
the
indians
are
in
future
to
be
ruled
first
as
in
duty
bound
he
points
out
that
anything
savouring
of
communism
is
against
the
laws
of
heaven
and
of
man
that
the
indians
in
their
were
really
slaves
the
industrious
working
for
the
idle
and
so
forth
that
their
clothes
were
scanty
that
they
were
not
allowed
to
freely
mix
with
spaniards
and
were
kept
a
race
apart
then
like
a
prudent
statesman
having
made
his
apologia
existentia
sua
and
blown
off
much
virtuous
steam
he
comes
to
business
and
business
as
we
know
is
the
great
soberer
of
theorists
no
matter
on
what
side
they
theorize
brabo
after
the
article
to
which
i
have
referred
in
chapter
ix
comes
this
most
curious
paragraph
taken
in
connection
with
the
inalienable
right
which
according
to
himself
the
indians
had
of
free
communication
with
the
outer
world
because
i
am
informed
that
many
indians
who
have
been
absent
in
the
army
of
the
portuguese
and
have
resided
for
lengthened
periods
in
rio
pardo
viamont
and
other
parts
have
returned
to
their
towns
you
will
take
care
that
all
these
with
their
families
shall
be
removed
to
those
towns
either
in
the
interior
or
distant
from
those
frontiers
as
it
is
not
convenient
that
they
should
remain
on
them
the
frontiers
or
close
to
them
and
thus
you
will
proceed
successively
with
the
indians
who
return
without
leaving
one
in
order
to
avoid
any
chance
of
communication
which
might
be
most
prejudicial
surely
a
satire
on
his
own
abuse
of
the
jesuits
for
keeping
the
indians
mewed
up
from
intercourse
with
the
outside
world
it
may
be
that
he
had
perceived
the
indians
were
not
fit
to
hold
their
own
indeed
it
is
certain
he
had
done
so
for
on
he
writes
is
not
convenient
to
leave
them
the
indians
entire
liberty
for
it
would
be
in
the
extreme
fatal
and
prejudicial
to
their
interests
because
the
astuteness
and
sagacity
of
the
spaniards
would
triumph
easily
over
their
rusticity
is
an
ingenious
euphuism
and
might
well
be
used
with
good
effect
in
the
like
circumstances
when
occasion
serves
but
as
no
single
article
of
any
document
set
forth
by
any
government
can
be
straightforward
and
single
in
its
purpose
and
as
all
laws
are
made
with
an
eye
upon
some
party
presently
in
power
after
the
paragraph
just
quoted
on
the
next
page
occurs
the
following
sentence
under
the
head
of
with
the
spaniards
is
to
be
free
is
laid
down
that
between
the
indians
and
the
spaniards
commerce
should
be
free
in
order
that
mutual
dealings
should
unite
them
in
friendship
therefore
to
the
ordinary
mind
it
is
impossible
to
make
out
what
really
was
intended
and
whether
commerce
was
to
be
free
or
not
those
little
differences
apart
the
constitution
ran
entirely
upon
jesuit
lines
that
which
was
so
prejudicial
during
the
jesuits
rule
was
formally
in
chapter
iv
of
the
constitution
the
instant
that
their
power
was
placed
in
other
hands
even
the
prohibition
to
the
spaniards
to
enter
the
jesuit
towns
and
reside
there
was
formally
kept
up
in
chapter
with
the
sole
alteration
that
for
three
months
of
the
year
they
might
reside
amongst
the
indians
on
certain
conditions
most
prolixly
set
forth
so
that
it
will
be
seen
that
if
the
jesuits
did
ill
as
usual
any
ill
they
did
was
carefully
perpetuated
by
their
successors
and
quite
as
naturally
all
that
they
strove
to
do
in
favour
of
the
indians
was
most
carefully
undone

conclusion
it
is
the
fashion
of
some
to
say
that
history
of
whatever
nature
can
but
be
written
dispassionately
at
a
period
sufficiently
removed
from
the
events
of
which
it
treats
to
have
allowed
the
heat
of
passion
to
evaporate
this
is
as
false
as
almost
every
other
dictum
which
men
take
on
trust
forgetting
that
to
have
passed
into
the
proverbial
stage
a
saying
must
have
been
foolish
at
the
start
in
order
that
it
should
have
got
itself
commended
by
the
majority
of
mankind
the
heat
of
passion
never
evaporates
in
regard
to
events
which
at
the
epoch
of
their
acting
caused
great
controversies
from
writings
of
contemporaries
the
take
a
bias
in
the
same
way
that
men
unconsciously
pass
on
the
microbes
of
disease
to
their
best
friends
only
from
inventories
and
rolls
of
court
state
papers
and
the
like
is
it
possible
to
get
unbiassed
matter
and
even
then
figures
those
chief
deceivers
of
mankind
can
be
well
cooked
for
or
against
according
to
the
bias
of
the
man
who
draws
them
up
still
when
they
are
drawn
up
by
enemies
they
often
quite
unwittingly
show
out
the
truth
in
a
letter
dated
october
bucareli
sends
a
list
to
aranda
of
the
effects
of
many
of
the
jesuits
taken
from
paraguay
and
sent
by
him
to
spain
the
list
itself
speaks
volumes
in
defence
of
the
jesuits
in
paraguay
whatever
may
have
been
their
faults
the
governor
himself
or
even
charles
iii
could
not
have
charged
upon
the
captured
priests
that
they
had
got
together
a
large
stock
of
property
during
their
mission
life
the
first
upon
the
list
pedro
zabaleta
took
ten
shirts
two
two
sheets
three
two
pairs
of
shoes
two
pairs
of
socks
and
a
pound
and
a
half
of
snuff
the
others
were
in
general
less
well
set
up
with
shirts
some
few
had
cloaks
and
one
sigismundo

a

but
all
of
them
had
their
snuff
the
only
relic
of
their
luxurious
mission
life
manuel

their
provincial
testifies
in
a
paper
sent
with
the
list
that
most
of
the
clothes
were
taken
from

common
stock
and
all
the
snuff
what
sort
of
treatment
they
endured
upon
their
passage
in
the
two
frigates
fernando
and
nicolas
is
quite
unknown
but
certainly
their
luggage
could
not
have
been
in
the
way
and
for
their
snuff
no
doubt
they
husbanded
it
with
care
during
the
long
two
months
which
in
those
days
was
thought
a
record
run
in
the
missions
which
they
had
so
long
tended
with
such
care
giving
their
love
to
the
indians
in
their
machiavelian
way
all
was

dean

are
the
only
two
contemporary
writers
who
treat
of

from

outside

official
world
the
dean
a
man
of
the
old
school
was
kindly
and
humane
well
educated
and
having
been
brought
up
in
tucuman
amongst
an
indian
population
looked
on
the
indians
in
a
kindly
way
as
though
differing
in
essential
points
from
races
which
had
been
for
centuries
exposed
to
civilization
and
its
effects
his
description
of
the
indians
has
for
veracity
and
observation
not
often
been
surpassed
he
says
are
of
a
pale
colour
well
made
and
well
set
up
their
talent
and
capacity
are
capable
of
much
advancement
though
they
lack
invention
in
themselves
yet
are
they
excellent
in
imitation
idleness
seems
natural
to
them
although
it
may
be
more
the
effect
of
habit
than
of
temperament
their
inclination
towards
acquiring
knowledge
is
decided
and
novelty
has
its
full
effect
upon
their
minds
ambitious
of
command
they
acquit
themselves
with
honour
in
the
positions
to
which
they
may
attain
eloquence
is
held
amongst
them
in
the
first
place
and
avarice
in
no
respect
degrades
their
minds
an
injurious
word
offends
them
more
than
punishments
which
they
solicit
rather
than
undergo
the
former
outrage
incontinency
in
their
women
they
look
upon
but
with
indifference
and
even
husbands
are
little
sensible
to
acts
of
infidelity
conjugal
love
has
but
slight
influence
upon
the
treatment
which
they
give
their
wives
fathers
of
families
care
for
their
sons
but
little
the
serenity
of
mind
of
all
these
indians
in
the
midst
of
the
greatest
troubles
is
without
equal
in
the
world
never
a
sigh
with
them
takes
off
the
bitterness
of
suffering
the
paraguayan
jesuits
were
allowed
to
take
away
all
their
personal
property

it

no
one
who
knows
the
indians
but
must
confess
that
dean
funes
had
made
a
study
of
their
character
deeper
than
is
his
own
azara
on
the
other
hand
was
a
man
of
science
his
books
upon
the
birds
and
quadrupeds
of
paraguay
still
hold
the
field
and
are
esteemed
for
curious
and
minute
observation
and
accuracy
as
to
scientific
facts
the
man
himself
was
an
extremely
able
writer
a
captain
in
the
spanish
navy
and
well
educated
for
twenty
years
he
served
in
paraguay
and
in
the
river
plate
with
credit
to
himself
and
profit
to
the
country
which
he
served
educated
as
he
was
in
the
school
of
the
encyclopaedists
amongst
the
strictest
of
the
pharisees
of
liberalism
to
him
the
very
name
of
jesuit
was
anathema
after
the
fashion
of
his
kind
he
seemed
unable
to
distinguish
between
the
scheming
jesuits
at
european
courts
and
the
simple
and
missionaries
in
paraguay
all
were
anathema
and
therefore
all
their
system
was
repugnant
to
him
and
though
a
kindly
man
as
is
set
forth
abundantly
in
all
his
works
he
never
paused
to
think
that
there
could
be
a
difference
between
his
ideal
free
liberal
citizen
voting
and
exercising
all
his
right
of
citizenship
in
a
free
commonwealth
after
the
fashion
of
a
dormouse
freely
exercising
his
natural
functions
in
the
receiver
of
an
and
a
simple
indian
of
the
paraguayan
woods
freedom
to
him
as
it
has
been
to
many
theorists
was
an
abstract
thing
possessing
which
a
man
even
though
starving
must
in
its
mere
possession
find
true
happiness
he
never
paused
to
inquire
as
even
bucareli
did
if
the
mission
indians
could
hold
their
own
under
free
competition
with
the
of
the
surrounding
spanish
settlers
therefore
he
is
the
authority
whom
liberals
always
quote
against
the
system
of
the
jesuits
when
he
inveighs
against
their
the
modern
liberal
claps
his
hands
and
sees
a
kindred
daniel
come
to
judgment
as
he
would
do
if
in
damaraland
the
germans
set
up
a
socialistic
settlement
amongst
the
negro
tribes
and
some
liberal
economist
denounced
it
with
an
oath
azara
quite
forgets
that
as
dean
funes
says
the
of
property
was
very
weak
amongst
the
indians
and
that
their
minds
were
degraded
by
the
vice
of
avarice
still
azara
was
an
honest
man
a
keen
observer
and
impartial
as
far
as
his
upbringing
and
the
tenets
he
had
imbibed
in
youth
permitted
him
to
be
upon
the
question
of
the
jesuits
he
was
entirely
prejudiced
although
few
have
stood
up
more
stoutly
to
condemn
the
faulty
system
which
the
spaniards
pursued
towards
the
indians
in
both
americas
but
on
account
of
his
political
proclivities
azara
is
quite
silent
as
to
the
state
into
which
the
missions
fell
after
the
jesuits
had
been
expelled
no
doubt
he
thought
that
once
their
faulty
system
was
removed
the
indians
would
soon
become
what
he
judged
civilized
and
hold
their
own
with
those
around
them
though
of
another
race
and
blood
funes
upon
the
contrary
fully
exposes
all
the
rapacity
and
incompetence
of
the
new
shepherds
left
by
bucareli
to
guard
the
jesuits
sheep
of
guarani
and
without
patience
to
acquire
it
confusion
reigned
in
the
missions
as
in
a
tower
of
babel
and
he
goes
on
to
say
imperious
tone
of
order
was
substituted
for
the
paternal
manner
of
the
jesuits
and
as
a
deaf
man
who
can
not
hear
has
to
be
taught
by
blows
that
was
the
teaching
they
the
indians
had
to
bear
shortly
he
says
wall
of
hatred
and
contempt
began
to
rise
between
the
indians
and
their
masters
and
the
priests
who
by
the
virtue
of
their
office
ought
to
have
been
the
ministers
of
peace
being
without
influence
to
command
and
not
entirely
irreproachable
in
their
ministry
added
themselves
to
the
discord
and
dissension
which
arose
funes
de
la
historia
civil
book
cap
bucareli
as
soon
as
he
knew
what
was
going
on
advised
that
all
the
priests
appointed
by
himself
should
be
replaced
by
others
this
accordingly
was
done
but
it
was
even
then
too
late
the
missions
went
from
bad
to
worse
of
the
vast
quantities
of
cattle
few
were
left
the
priests
followed
the
example
of
their
prototypes
hofni
and
phineas
went
about
armed
took
indian
mistresses
and
neglected
all
religious
duties
treating
the
indians
after
the
fashion
of
the
spaniards
in
the
settlements
thus
the
arcadian
life
which
had
subsisted
more
than
two
hundred
years
in
the
brief
space
of
two
short
years
was
lost

vast
estancias
in
which
at

more

as

preserved
sheltering
them
from

of

cold
northern

and
its

are
those
no

who
think
that

should
be
planted
out
at

to
take
its
chance
of
life
in
the
keen

of
the
north

enough
with

of

they
may
be
right
but
after
all
that
which
has
felt
the
tropic
sun
is
for
the
tropics

grow
under

tantalizing
sunshine
of
the
north
which
lights

warm
it
must
have

of

to
deliberately
transplant

chilling
atmosphere

so
to
nip

kill

which
crave
only
the

is
a
crime
against

a
crime
posterity

taunt

up

we
in

piously
curse

a
quiet
life

is
scant
truce

that
my

have
to
take
their
choice
whether
to
side
with
funes

azara
in
judging
of
the
jesuits

there
is
no
middle

the
old
and
new
no
no
chink
in
which
imagination

drive

to
stop

therefore
no
doubt
the

was
doomed
to
disappear

for
myself
i
am
glad
that
