i
am
a
little
tired
of
all
things
mortal
i
see
through
eyelids
languorous
the
old
monotonous
gold
sun
set
slowly
through
the
western
portal
where
i
recline
upon
my
deep
dîwân
in
ispahân
i
am
a
little
weary
of
the
persian
girl
that
i
lov
i
am
quite
tir
of
love
and
i
am
weary
of
the
smoking
censers
and
the
sweet
diversion
of
stroking
leila
hair
i
thought
so
fair
at
last
i
think
i
am
quite
tired
of
beauty
why
do
the
stars
shine
always
in
the
sky
i
think
if
i
might
die
something
more
sweet
less
tiring
than
the
duty
of
kissing
her
might
be
i
am
tired
of
myrrh
and
kissing
her
khaled
come
come
and
slowly
move
the
scented
gold
narghilé
away
let
the
lyres
cease
and
now
a
little
peace
for
see
leila
hath
repented
of
singing
hafiz
songs
melodiously
and
languidly
surely
all
things
are
vain
and
great
thanksgiving
is
due
not
surely
all
things
now
are
vain
and
all
my
heart
is
fain
of
something
something
far
too
great
for
living
nothing
is
very
sad
nor
wonderful
nor
beautiful
well
now
since
all
things
are
not
worth
the
winning
goodbye
with
these
i
have
a
little
play
and
once
alas
i
that
gorgeous
golden
sins
be
mine
for
sinning
but
now
i
would
not
leave
my
palanquin
for
any
sin
and
long
ago
i
prov
in
great
compassion
for
man
that
brahm
is
not
nor
ever
was
but
now
alas
alas
i
would
he
were
that
in
the
olden
fashion
i
might
laugh
once
again
ere
all
is
said
but
brahm
is
dead
then
with
philosophy
i
bor
me
duly
and
since
i
could
not
slumber
all
the
time
i
in
sweet
golden
rhyme
on
white
papyrus
scented
with
patchouli
wrote
masterpieces
the
earth
was
full
so
beauty
wearied
me
in
order
slowly
love
joy
and
victory
came
unto
me
i
kiss
them
languidly
and
virtue
came
and
duty
stiff
and
holy
to
these
i
said
pray
come
another
day
and
turn
away
now
since
of
all
i
am
a
little
weary
and
since
on
earth
i
must
a
while
sojourn
and
since
a
while
must
burn
the
censer
of
my
long
existence
dreary
all
things
shall
walk
that
own
my
mastery
in
luxury
my
ennui
shall
in
vestments
falling
lowly
stiff
purple
trailing
long
episcopal
sweep
through
her
palace
hall
like
to
a
consecrated
bishop
holy
my
sin
from
golden
goblets
of
byzant
shall
drink
absinthe
and
my
wanton
goddess
pleasure
my
candles
are
all
burning
at
her
shrine
shall
be
made
drunk
with
wine
and
walk
unto
the
measure
of
shawms
no
rhyme
for
shawms
all
they
that
wait
upon
me
in
my
glory
my
purple
pride
and
my
luxuriousness
and
my
voluptuousness
shall
show
within
their
faces
transitory
something
more
subtile
than
all
life
can
give
while
i
shall
live
ah
all
is
liv
all
eaten
all
is
drunken
soul
is
there
anything
now
left
for
thee
excepting
sanctity
nay
we
too

we
have
confess
said

have
drunk
out
of
heavy
goblets
golden
as
from
some
hellish
tabernaculum

i
know
quite
all
the
poisons
all
the
olden
sins
all
the
ténébreux

again
land
of
cocagne
the
book
of
jade
part
one
ashtoreth
in
thy
blue
pallid
gown
that
shimmereth
so
pale
thou
standest
in
the
wan
moonlight
where
the
gold
censer
near
thy
body
white
wraps
thee
around
with
its
perfumed
breath
so
wan
thy
high
tiara
glimmereth
above
thy
mystical
far
eyes
of
light
thou
seemest
some
dead
goddess
of
the
night
o
starry
love
o
changeless
ashtoreth
pallid
thou
standest
in
thy
divinity
like
some
of
the
buried
time
before
whose
face
priests
sing
in
solemn
chime
so
i
prostrate
before
thy
deity
unto
thy
face
have
solemn
praises
sung
and
in
my
hands
a
golden
censer
swung
parfait
amour
it
is
not
that
thy
face
is
fair
as
dying
sunsets
are
nor
that
thy
lovely
eyelids
wear
the
splendour
of
a
star
tis
the
deep
sadness
of
thine
eyes
hath
my
heart
captive
led
and
that
within
thy
soul
i
prize
the
calmness
of
the
dead
o
holy
love
o
fair
white
face
o
sweet
lost
soul
of
thine
thy
bosom
is
an
thy
kisses
holy
wine
sweet
incense
offer
for
my
bliss
is
thy
corrupted
breath
and
on
thy
stained
lips
i
kiss
the
holy
lips
of
death
wherefore
because
thy
heart
is
all
fill
full
of
mournfulness
and
thy
gold
head
as
with
a
pall
hung
with
sinfulness
because
thy
soul
is
utterly
sinful
unto
the
core
therefore
my
heart
is
bound
to
thee
dear
love
forevermore
opium
naught
is
more
sweet
than
gently
to
let
dream
the
pallid
flower
of
life
asleep
alway
where
the
dim
censer
sends
up
far
from
day
unceasingly
its
stream
o
where
the
air
winds
its
steam
about
thy
naked
body
disarray
shall
not
today
gold
to
thy
shut
eyes
seem
born
and
forgot
in
the
dead
ages
gray
sunk
from
life
mournful
loud
processional
for
thee
shall
not
with
high
uplifted
urn
the
night
pour
out
dreams
that
awake
and
say
we
were
o
pallid
maiden
vesperal
before
the
world
we
also
in
our
turn
by
the
vain
morning
gold
scatter
away
sombre
sonnet
i
love
all
sombre
and
autumnal
things
regal
and
mournful
and
funereal
things
strange
and
curious
and
majestical
whereto
a
solemn
savor
of
death
clings
coerulian
serpents
mark
with
azure
rings
awful
cathedrals
where
rich
shadows
fall
hoarse
symphonies
sepulchral
as
a
pall
mad
crimes
adorn
with
bestial
blazonings
therefore
i
love
thee
more
than
aught
that
dies
within
whose
subtile
beauty
slumbereth
the
twain
solemnity
of
life
and
death
therefore
i
sit
beside
thee
far
from
day
and
look
into
thy
holy
eyes
alway
thy
desolate
eyes
thine
unillumin
eyes
languor
although
thy
face
be
whiter
than
the
dawn
fairer
than
aught
the
dawning
hath
descried
hast
thou
not
now
o
dear
love
deified
enough
of
kisses
upon
thy
forehead
wan
the
days
and
nights
like
beads
to
pray
upon
pass
by
before
our
eyes
and
not
abide
and
so
these
things
shall
be
till
we
have
died
until
our
bodies
to
the
earth
are
gone
i
think
how
pleasant
such
a
thing
must
be
that
all
thy
lovely
limbs
should
fall
away
and
drop
to
nothing
in
their
soft
decay
then
may
thy
buried
body
turn
to
me
with
new
love
on
thy
changed
lips
like
fire
and
kiss
me
with
a
kiss
that
shall
not
tire
ennui
i
sat
in
tall
gomorrah
on
a
day
boring
myself
with
solitude
and
dreams
when
like
strange
priests
with
sacerdotal
tread
the
seven
mortal
sins
in
rich
array
came
in
and
knelt
one
old
and
weak
and
gray
one
that
was
shrouded
like
a
person
dead
and
one
whose
robes
cast
gleams
upon
her
scornful
face
at
peace
alway
they
swung
before
me
amschirs
of
strange
gold
and
one
most
beautiful
began
to
pray
dreamily
garmented
in
pallid
blue
but
i
said
only

have
dream
of
you

spot
to
see
with
waving
palms
and
towers
gleaming
great
deserts
round
that
isle
of
blissful
seeming

stretching
endlessly
sonnet
when
i
contemplate
how
my
state
is
low
and
how
my
pride
that
had
the
earth
for
throne
in
this
dark
city
sitteth
all
alone
my
heart
is
fain
for
death
to
end
its
woe
then
when
i
think
how
all
the
great
below
had
only
sorrow
and
grief
through
all
their
days
i
that
with
these
shall
some
time
stand
in
place
my
fortune
like
their
bitter
fortune

among
whom
also
holy
baudelaire
though
unto
him
the
loftiest
lot
was
given
to
hear
the
blessed
muses
sing
in
heaven
past
his
few
days
in
anguish
and
despair
yet
did
he
not
bow
down
his
mournful
head
until
peace
found
him
in
his
glory
dead
so
thou
in
this
low
lair
although
in
sorrow
and
grief
thou
dost
remain
though
of
all
things
whereof
thy
soul
was
fain
remaineth
only
pain
yet
be
not
thou
o
soul
disconsolate
forget
not
thou
thy
state
sonnet
be
not
cast
down
my
heart
and
be
not
sad
that
thou
like
common
men
must
sorrow
know
not
only
they
that
live
and
die
below
but
the
gods
thy
supreme
sorrow
had
not
unto
tammuz
was
this
fortune
given
not
to
know
grief
whom
starry
ashtoreth
sought
through
the
realm
of
death
far
from
the
great

and
the
stars
of

osiris
also
could
not
but
to
die

reigneth

among

when
his
long
grief
was
finished
hid
his
great
glory
in
the

all
these

sorrow

ballad
the
lady
rode
the
strange
sky
pall
through
the
leafy
woods
funereal
and
all
the
length
of
her
moonlit
way
was
wanly
white
as
the
light
of
day
solemnly
rob
she
rode
along
unmindful
of
their
droning
throng
that
throng
her
shadowy
path
alas
as
though
to
see
her
funeral
pass
so
through
the
mournful
forest
slow
her
palfrey
silken
feet
did
go
bearing
her
solemnly
like
a
god
over
the
sod
she
laught
to
see
the
dead
desire
that
even
now
her
life
should
tire
she
laught
to
think
that
to
the
earth
they
call
her
that
was
full
of
mirth
and
though
before
her
horse
head
throng
the
wan
legions
of
the
dead
wanly
attempting
to
stop
her
way
she
halted
not
for
their
legions
gray
but
rode
through
the
midnight
mystic
noon
under
the
far
gaze
of
the
moon
then
out
from
the
dying
woods
at
last
into
the
moonlit
plain
she
passt
the
misty
stars
were
almost
dead
sunk
in
the
heavens
overhead
while
low
down
in
the
solemn
skies
the
white
moon
wan
as
one
that
dies
solemnly
through
the
misty
air
she
rode
with
gold
gems
in
her
hair
bright
were
her
holy
eyes
divine
and
red
her
lips
as
the
red
red
wine
at
last
in
the
unceasing
night
down
from
her
palfrey
she
doth
alight
by
the
strange
murmuring
of
the
sea
she
climbs
the
tall
stair
fearlessly
and
cometh
at
last
to
her
chamber
high
beneath
the
wide
face
of
the
sky
at
last
her
journey
being
done
she
hath
her
golden
stays
undone
and
being
a
little
wearied
hath
laid
her
naked
on
her
bed
thinking
to
slumber
like
the
dead
changelessness
when
death
shall
touch
thy
body
beautiful
and
thou
that
art
of
all
the
earth
most
fair
shalt
close
thine
eyes
upon
the
shining
air
an
unadorned
gold
urn
to
make
full
when
that
thou
liest
quietly
in
the
dark
bosom
of
the
earth
divine
being
turned
unto
a
heap
of
ashes
fine
for
love
of
whose
white
face
all
men
have
burn
then
in
the
earth
o
beautiful
white
love
thy
beauty
shall
not
wholly
end
and
cease
when
that
thou
art
gone
to
endless
peace
though
all
things
beneath
the
sky
above
fade
away
it
knoweth
not
to
die
but
abideth
changeless

as
gold
to
her
she
weareth

upon

on

go
by

shrouded
in

empty

piteous
even
as

sailor
on

tossing
deep

dolorous
vow
that
sears
not
to
be
lesser
than
the
great
of
old

me
forget
the
heavy
old
dead
years
and
all
that
lives
from
out
the
writhing
past
old
struggles
dead
ambitions
buried
tears
and
that
white
face
that
i
shall
see
the
last
sweet
is
forgetfulness
most
sweet
to
lie
sunken
from
sorrow
in
our
pleasant
vale
where
but
the
sun
shines
and
the
clouds
go
by
even
as
to
them
that
through
deep
waters
sail
the
toiling
shore
fades
and
becomes
a
sky
and
evermore
behind
the
billows
fail
sweet
to
forget
the
things
that
were
green
pastures
where
the
clouds
sail
by
on
high
dead
sundawns
over
pathless
prairies
fair
and
suns
long
sunk
beneath
the
wall
of
the
sky
under
the
sun
my
spirit
lies
alone
drunken
with
slumber
and
mild
exstasy
sleep
sweet
sleep
long
unto
mine
eyes
unknown
drops
on
me
as
ripe
fruit
drops
from
a
tree
my
dim
eyes
see
the
valley
the
clouds
fade
and
the
gold
sun
over
me
and
the
world
murmur
sounds
within
my
lair
like
the
far
tossing
of
some
infinite
sea
within
the
heavy
air
all
fades
all
fades
and
grows
afar
afar
leaving
my
soul
alone
empty
of
care
even
as
happy
bodies
are
even
so
i
slumber
in
my
tireless
close
while
the
whole
world
fades
like
a
fading
star
dies
like
the
perfume
of
a
dying
rose
consolation
among
all
sorrows
that
my
heart
hath
known
among
all
sorrows
that
my
spirit
keep
forever
buried
their
mountains
steep
standeth
one
consolation
one
alone

know
that
earth
shall
be
for
death
a
throne
and
evermore
within
their
burials
deep
the
banded
nations
of
the
earth
shall
sleep
sunken
in

then
all

shall
be
a
quietness

women
beautiful
with
their
delights
all
they
that
had
such
striving
and
distress
and
endless
weariness
in
all
the
lands

thy
coming
on
is
like
a
conqueror
before
thy
footsteps
the
world
glory
dies
within
mine
ears
thy
voice
doth
ever
rise
like

ocean
beating
on

art
made
kindred
with

daughter
of
glory
daughter
of
consolations
thy
face

of
death
o

i
made
one
with
thee
that
on

thereof
ii
lo
now
my
life
is
gone
unto
eclipse
upon
thy
perilous
bosom
lo
i
die
faint
with
the
utter
whole
of
exstasy
with
unassuaged
lips
against
thy
lips
that
can
give
no
more
joy
lo
at
the
place
of
utter
joy
lo
at
joy
throne
which
none
shall
reach
with
eyes
now
weary
grown
i
lie
slain
at
its
utmost
golden
base
yea
we
have
call
the
white
stars
to
behold
our
pale
and
fainting
faces
sick
with
joy
oregal
lips
that
shall
death
sting
destroy
i
have
suck
bare
life
cup
upon
thy
breath

me
to
death
lo
now
our
lips
are
cold
wilt
thou
not
bring
new
joy
o
death
o
death
evening
song
lo
all
the
passionate
pale
evening
i
lay
between
the
breasts
of
my
beloved
among
the
lilies
in
the
lily
garden
the
sky
was
pale
and
all
the
sunset
faded
and
all
the
stars
i
saw
not
in
the
heaven
because
the
glory
of
her
face
above
me
i
saw
alone
wrapt
in
a
dream
of
slumber
and
lo
she
was
more
fair
than
all
the
lilies
among
the
lilies
in
the
lily
garden
and
all
her
hair
was
golden
chains
to
bind
me
and
all
her
mouth
was
crimson
fire
to
burn
me
and
all
the
world
became
as
wind
before
me
but
as
the
wind
before
her
face
that
passes
among
the
lilies
in
the
lily
garden
and
lo
her
face
was
fairer
than
the
stars
are
and
lo
her
breasts
were
whiter
than
the
moon
is
whiter
than
the
moon
and
tipp
with
crimson
coral
and
low
she
bow
her
body
low
before
me
and
gave
me
of
her
joy
unto
fulfilling
she
bow
her
head
whereto
the
stars
do
homage
before
whose
face
the
years
wax
dim
and
fading
before
whose
eyes
the
ages
pass
and
vanish
bow
her
low
down
before
me
like
a
lily
among
the
lilies
in
the
lily
garden
and
now
at
last
i
care
not
if
the
morning
come
at
all
or
the
pale
stars
have
setting
nay
i
care
not
if
the
whole
world
perish
perish
and
die
or
if
the
white
stars
falter
nay
i
care
not
if
the
night
forever
hold
me
by
her
and
all
things
have
ceasing
yea
because
her
lips
are
more
than
roses
yea
because
her
breasts
are
more
than
heaven
yea
because
her
face
is
more
than
god
is
among
the
lilies
in
the
lily
garden
song
of
the
stars
in
praise
of
her
o
starry
light
of
the
dim
universe
the
night
adoreth
thee
the
planets
high
that
reign
far
off
within
the
desert
sky
praise
thee
as
with
the
sound
of
dulcimers
and
all
the
temples
of
the
night
rehearse
thy
solemn
glory
everlastingly
o
thou
for
whom
the
moon
star
and
all
the
planets
and
the
milky
gleam
but
as
a
little
of
thy
praising
seem
and
the
great
lights
that
swim
through
heaven
afar
but
the
reflection
of
thy
glory
are
thou
only
art
these
are
but
shine
and
dream
thou
art
that
light
that
doth
the
stars
illume
thou
art
the
glimmer
of
the
moon
divine
all
these
are
but
the
garment
that
is
thine
thou
art
the
wonder
and
the
glow
the
bloom
thou
art
the
lonely
lamp
in
night
great
gloom
thou
art
the
skyey
light
the
starry
shine
starlight
is
but
the
glory
of
thy
face
the
shimmer
of
the
silver
planets
pale
is
but
the
dim
effulgence
of
thy
veil
and
the
great
passing
of
the
nights
and
days
is
all
but
as
the
perfume
of
thy
praise
o
holy
holy
holy
hail
o
hail
aubade
the
lady
awoke
before
the
cold
gray
dawn
and
had
no
joy
thereof
what
joy
is
mine
of
all
the
joy
of
love
when
love
is
gone
lo
all
the
air
is
strange
unto
mine
eyes
lo
all
the
stars
are
dead
only
the
moon
appeareth
overhead
as
one
that
dies
lo
all
the
garden
lieth
desolate
and
very
strange
to
see
wherein
the
roses
and
the
grass
for
me
blossom
of
late
o
wherein
my
roses
grew
o
odorous
dim
ways
why
are
ye
strange
to
me
as
perish
days
and
cold
with
dew
through
the
wide
window
creeps
the
cold
sweet
air
faint
with
sweet
it
stealeth
my
body
in
the
gloom
and
my
hair
surely
i
have
drunk
full
of
love
delight
but
now
my
lips
are
cold
while
the
pale
day
in
silence
doth
behold
the
dying
night
remember
remember
ye
whom
the
skies
delight
whose
faces
flame
with
the
falling
sun
that
after
sunset
cometh
the
night
that
sorrow
followeth
all
delight
when
love
and
lover
and
lov
are
one
o
ye
whose
days
are
as
sands
that
run
one
house
there
is
unknown
of
delight
one
garden
is
there
belov
of
none
one
place
there
is
unseen
of
the
sun
remember
ye
whom
the
skies
delight
song
she
hath
liv
the
life
of
a
rose
she
that
was
fair
blown
on
by
the
summer
air
grown
tall
in
a
golden
close
an
ending
is
set
to
delight
now
thou
art
as
grass
as
the
leaves
as
the
blossoms
that
pass
made
pale
at
the
touch
of
the
night
song
cometh
a
day
and
a
night
when
the
lamps
of
life
burn
dim
when
peace
is
secur
for
delight
and
poppies
for
the
flower
when
the
lamps
of
life
burn
dim
cometh
a
day
and
a
night
a
day
and
a
night
and
an
hour
cometh
the
end
of
the
years
when
the
cheeks
have
the
lilies
bloom
when
slumber
is
given
for
tears
and
the
breasts
to
the
worm
belong
when
the
cheeks
have
the
lilies
bloom
cometh
the
end
of
the
years
as
silence
after
the
song
cometh
a
day
and
a
night
for
him
to
whom
all
is
thrown
whose
own
is
the
bosom
white
whose
own
are
the
lips
of
gold
for
him
to
whom
all
is
thrown
cometh
a
day
and
a
night
to
have
and
to
own
and
to
hold
constancy
surely
thy
face
love
is
a
little
pale
and
somewhat
wan
thy
lips
that
were
so
red
and
though
my
kisses
might
raise
up
the
dead
to
waken
thy
deep
sleep
they
naught
avail
before
thy
stillness
some
poor
men
might
quail
but
i
shall
not
desert
thy
holy
bed
although
thy
passionate
lips
have
no
word
said
and
thine
adored
breasts
are
cold
like
hail
thou
art
gone
down
to
death
thou
art
gone
down
and
the
dead
things
shall
nestle
in
thy
hair
and
the
dust
shall
profane
thy
golden
crown
and
the
worms
shall
consume
thy
perfect
face
even
so
but
death
shall
bring
thee
no
disgrace
and
to
the
stars
i
cry
thou
art
most
fair
requiem
perfume
go
with
thee
on
thy
way
unto
thy
shaded
tomb
low
music
fall
lightly
as
autumn
leaves
about
thy
solemn
pall
faint
incense
rise
from
many
a
censer
swung
above
thy
closed
eyes
and
the
sounds
of
them

weary
of
seeing
shapeless
things
that
fly
and
flap
into
my
face
in
their
vile
flight
i
am
weary
of

into

horrible

down

the
house

far
in
the
melancholy

it
stands
far
off
and
through
the
vista
of
the
years
down
which
my
soul
its
helpless
journey
steers
it
flames
a
fire
to
lighten
all
the
lands
a
fire
that
burns
me
and
a
flame
that
brands
me
whose
dead
days
pass
slow
as
heavy

the
road
my
footsteps
tread
is
dim
and
still
there
darkness
abides
and
silence
endlessly
and
the

mine
eyes
can
scarcely
see
and
yet
the
light
and
sound
from
that
far
hill
like
the

my
weary
pathway
fill
so
that
it
seems
a
place
of
life
to
be
the
world
is
but
a
background
for
it
there
there
where
it
stands
loud
like
a
beaten
lyre
and
flames
like
some
vast
whereat
my
heart
to
fail
doth
not
forbear
of
all
the
things
that
have
been
made
only
the
house
remains
a
quenchless
fire
ah
god
that
this
thing
were
not
in
the
world
the
hateful
house
that
flames
with
light
and
song
and
weary
singing
all
the
ages
long
ah
that
this
might
in
the
dust
be
hurl
and
crush
and
slain
even
as
my
heart
where
the
kindly
armies
of
the
worm
do
throng
yea
surely
i
have
seen
it
long
ago
far
sunken
in
the
weary
dust
of
time
yea
surely
even
that
stair
so
hard
to
climb
i
climb

strode
its

which

with

me
through
the
bitter
gloom
all
them
whom
life
with
deepest
grief
hath
fed
whom
also
here
among
the
hopeless
dead
through
hell
pursueth
maniac
gnashing
doom
me
there
forever
crusht
to
hopeless
stone
they
passt
by
all
the
damn
they
shall
not
know
through
all
eternity
but
only
woe
now
hear
no
sound
but
sound
of
them
that
groan
and
unto
me
that
sat
than
these
more
low
these
seem
like
happy
gods
that
heaven
own
they
past
away
and
there
in
hell
alone
my
heart
took
up
again
its
ancient
woe
scorn
dead
am
i
and
ye
triumph
me
dead
ye
that
within
mine
eyes
have
found
your
home
ye
that
are
soft
and
blind
and
white
like
foam
ye
that
have
made
of
me
your
meat
and
bread
unto
the
worms
i
am
abandoned
over
my
flesh
their
loathed
cohorts
roam
upon
my
heart
whereto
their
hosts
have
clomb
their
hungry
lips
shall
evermore
be
fed
here
am
i
but
a
dead
corpse
in
a
tomb
i
shall
not
out
from
my
accurs
abode
inhabited
by
the
dull
worm
and
the
toad
ye
vile
sojourners
in
my
rotten
room
torment
me
with
your
everlasting
goad
i
scorn
you
till
the
end
shall
come
of
doom
the
grave
the
loathed
worms
are
crawling
over
me
all
the
dead
hours
about
my
buried
head
their
soft
intolerable
mouths
are
gathered
and
in
my
dead
eyes
that
have
ceas
to
see
i
am
full
of
worms
and
rotten
utterly
dead
dead
dead
dead
dead
dead
dead
dead
dead
dead
the
lifeless
earth
lies
close
against
mine
eyes
i
know
that
i
have
rotted
long
ago
my
limbs
are
made
one
with
the
worms
i
know
where
all
my
head
and
body
putrifies
so
in
the
earth
my
coffin
ordure
lies
within
my
loathed
shambles
strait
and
low
there
is
no
thing
now
where
my
face
hath
been
and
all
my
flesh
lies
soft
upon
the
floor
unto
my
heart
the
worms
have
found
a
door
and
all
my
body
is
to
the
worms
akin
they
long
time
since
their
feasting
did
begin
and
they
shall
part
not
from
me
evermore
here
lie
i
stretch
out
through
the
rotting
years
and
i
am
surely
weary
of
the
grave
and
i
have
sometimes
thought
that
i
might
rave
and
my
two
perish
eyes
almost
shed
tears
there
is
no
one
that
sees
and
none
that
hears
i
shall
not
out
from
my
corrupted
cave
here
now
forever
with
the
lustful
worms
i
lie
within
my
putrid
sunken
sty
and
through
eternity
my
soul
shall
die
o
thou
toward
whom
all
my
dead
spirit
squirms
forevermore
i
love
thee
through
all
terms
until
the
dead
stars
rot
in
the
black
sky

thou
art
at

perfect
from
the

thee
petrified

and
the
putrified
that
made
thee
up

by
that
artist
great
now
crystalliz
unto
a
changeless
state
that
thing
thou
walkedst
nos
and

and

eternally
severely
doth
abide
sunk
from
the
bands
of
them
that
drank

green
mummies

above
thy

unripen
mummies
they
intemperate
seek
in

their
doom
in

thee
no

doth
illume

darkness
of
the
tomb

all

a
corpse
in

clay
the

secrets
read
even
as
a
corpse
upon
whose

the

vast
sepulchre
our
fainting
souls
their

whisper
strange

a

with

i
saw
a

feet
planted
on

the

stand
round
with

not
out

thou
dreamest
of
splendour
that
shall
never
die
and
in
thy
heart
the

iv
i
saw
a
dead
corpse
lying
on
the
floor
of
a
tomb
worms
were
in
its
woman
head
its
black
flesh
lay
about
it
shred
on
shred
and
the
dead
things
slept
in
its
bosom
hoar
and
evermore
inside
that
loathed
door
it
turn
itself
as
one
upon
a
bed
it
turn
itself
as
one
whom
sleep
hath
fled
as
one
that
the
sweet
pangs
of
passion
bore
and
from
its
passionate
mouth
corrupted
sore
and
from
its
lips
that
are
no
longer
red
came
forth
love
accents
and
it
spake
and
said
the
pleiades
and
night
are
and
i
am
left
alone
in
wearyhead
and
in
its
heart
the
worms
lie
evermore

would
now
that
the
sweet
light
of
the

might
once
again
shine
down
upon

weary
am
i
of
my
rottenness

that

thou
art
done
with

nevermore

my
body
is
aweary
of
the

is
a
hundred
years
since
in
the
grave

have
lain
down
between
four
narrow
walls
shut
up
with
putrid
darkness

the

there
is
no
flesh
upon
my
body
now
that
was
so
long
on
my
shelf

had
life

face
of
the

not
yet
utterly
putrified
and
the
worms
yet
within
my
flesh
abound
i
do
repent
me
that
i
did
not
learn
what
life
was
while
i
liv
beneath
the
sun
at
least
then
i
might
think
of
what
i
had
done
but
i
am
rotten
and
i
have
not
liv
corpse
i
would
that
i
might
leave
this
place
of
ordure
and
look
once
more
upon
the
face
of
the
world
where
the
sun
is
corpse
o
foolish
wouldst
thou
show
forth
thy
dripping
excrements
and
shredded
rottenness
to
the
face
of
day
stink
and
be
still
and
leave
us
here
in
peace

me
not
o

my
bones
are
clean
and
dry
as
the

art
a

me
not
thou
that
i

both
ye
dead

lo
i
that

unburied
yesterday

over
thee
where
the

not

been

ha
ha
i
know
wherefore
thou
speakest
so
because
thy
torture
is
too
great
for
thee
and
the

gnawing
and
thy

in
thy

thou

ye

ye
will
learn
to
be

when
here
for
a
long
time
ye
always
spout
and
roar
at
first
before
the
time
of
rottenness
but
so
i
suppose
it
must
be
not
the
first
and
ye
shall
not
be
the

so
fast
i
the

so
eagerly
they
are

and
they

and
they
are

again
just
for
this
end
hideously
propagated
evermore
a
voice
above
singing
golden
is
the
sunlight
when
the
daylight
closes
golden
blow
the
roses
ere
the
spring
is
old
all
thy
hair
is
golden
falling
long
and
lowly
round
thy
bosom
holy
and
thy
heart
is
of
fine
gold
fragments
i
and
since
i
understood
not
what
so
strong
driveth
all
these
at
such
exstatic
pace
i
too
went
down
and
joined
in
the
throng
and
many
sitting
in
a
lowly
place
i
saw
where
sense
and
vision
darkness
clogs
with
one
wife
with
munched
face
and
bestial
litter
as
of
rats
or
hogs
these
are
all
they
that
eat
and
multiply
in
the
same
manner
with
low
apes
and
dogs
like
these
they
live
and
like
these
they
shall
die
pass
thou
from
these
said
then
to
me
that
voice
and
heed
not
thou
the
stinking
of
that
sty
then
saw
i
them
that
did
with
wine
rejoice
crowning
their
heads
with
roses
of
the
earth
i
too
sat
down
and
joined
in
that
noise
but
ask
me
soon
why
do
all
these
have
mirth
from
these
i
past
weary
of
myrrh
and
wine
others
apart
whose
spirits
had
more
dearth
sat
solitary
as
who
would
fain
divine
of
seeing
and
of
hearing
ill
content
with
these
i
sat
half
drunken
with
the
vine
and
sick
of
visions
that
aye
came
and
went
but
all
the
knowledge
that
their
striving
found
was
but
one
vision
more
than
wine
had
sent
all
these
also
shall
moulder
in
the
ground
from
these
i
past
as
from
dead
flesh
and
bones
then
came
i
where
the
kings
of
earth
sat
neath
purple
canopies
on
golden
thrones
these
offer
me
part
in
that
changeless
state
until
my
soul
wearied
of
brass
and
bronze
others
whose
sweating
nothing
could
abate
kingdoms
and
cities
build
and
overthrow
till
my
soul
wonder
at
the
striving
great
of
all
the
puppets
in
that
doth
the
string
move
them
with
such
urgency
that
all
their
limbs
such
strange
grimaces
show
these
are
all
they
that
do
one
made
reply
in
all
their
actions
never
could
i
find
what
they
were
doing
these
things
for
nor
why
from
these
i
past
as
from
the
deaf
and
blind
and
ever
as
i
went
the
solemn
brawl
of
all
these
mad
and
idiot
howl
behind
i
came
to
those
that
ceased
not
to
call
the
world
unto
them
shouting
and
my
heart
knew
not
why
these
so
loudly
bawl
and
some
stood
round
with
faces
that
implore
asking
for
peace
and
ever
those
that
gave
did
but
like
these
delude
themselves
the
more
but
rottenness
shall
stop
all
these
that
rave
last
some
there
were
that
did
with
vanity
toil
ever
with
unwearied
hands
to
save
and
to
eternize
all
things
great
and
high
with
these
i
stay
till
my
heart
questioned
what
are
the
things
thou
doëst
here
and
why
whereat
all
these
became
as
persons
dead
then
i
arose
from
among
these
the
last
and
follow
then
my
footsteps
led
and
among
them
that
reigned
then
i
past
and
among
them
that
ever
fain
would
know
and
among
them
whose
lot
with
wine
was
cast
i
past
the
prophets
and
the
and
among
them
that
joy
in
marble
and
in
song
and
all
that
seven
tir
of
long
ago
and
is
this
all
the
meaning
of
that
throng
this
all
o
heart
that
wast
of
seeing
fain
but
like
a
circle
that
still
seemeth
long
because
it
goeth
round
and
round
again
not
in
all
these
doth
any
reason
hide
no
more
than
in
the
words
of
the
insane
there
is
no
ground
for
sorrow
nor
in
pride
for
pride
nor
in
them
that
in
gladness
sate
wherefore
with
none
of
these
shall
i
abide
the
sought
is
vanity
the
seeking
great
vanity
the
vanity
for
none
of
these
change
i
my
solemn
state
ii
then
since
no
one
could
answer
unto
me
the
question
and
since
no
one
could
me
tell
the
wherefore
of
this
endless
vanity
of
all
the
spirits
that
on
earth
did
dwell
i
said
i
go
unto
the
absolute
he
will
perchance
release
me
from
this
hell
him
that
made
noisy
what
before
was
mute
i
found
upon
a
heap
of
filthy
dung
in
the
fashion
of
the
brute
in
strange
grimaces
still
his
face
he
wrung
up
to
the
chin
within
that
filth
immerst
which
still
his
busy
hands
about
him
flung
do
thou
those
clothes
wherein
he
is
inhearst
take
off
said
i
to
one
and
do
not
shirk
he
did
while
still
that
being
howl
and
curst
for
there
so
thick
and
muddy
was
the
murk
and
he
still
bore
of
clothes
so
thick
a
weight
i
knew
not
well
what
thing
therein
did
lurk
three
coverings
then
that
one
removed
straight
omniscience
omnipresence
omnipotence
from
off
the
thing
that
in
the
ordure
sate
then
did
his
truth
show
clear
to
every
sense
a
filthy
idiot
so
foul
and
low
that
decency
the
perfect
tale
prevents
and
i
o
thou
whose
nakedness
doth
show
like
one
not
in
the
womb
to
fulness
brought
why
are
all
things
that
are
if
thou
dost
know
then
he
replied
from
out
the
ordure
hot
brahma
great
brahma
everlasting
i
and
i
not
such
reply
my
question
sought
answer
thou
me
and
he
still
made
reply
brahma
great
brahma
repetition
vain
i
asked
again
and
brahma
he
did
cry
then
one
thereby
to
me
why
art
thou
fain
knowledge
to
have
from
it
it
knows
not
it
why
seek
for
truth
among
the
low
insane
then
he
that
did
within
the
ordure
sit
out
of
the
filth
that
lay
about
his
feet
such
things
as
children
make
with
little
wit
made
and
then
broke
and
did
the
act
repeat
i
have
made
all
the
worlds
he
gibbered
and
i
his
labour
with
these
words
did
greet
why
dost
thou
these
things
why
o
why
i
said
no
word
vouchsaf
the
mouth
of
him
that
stank
but
giggling
sounds
and
idiot
uttered
then
seated
in
that
place
of
ordure
rank
with
his
two
lips
he
made
a
cackling
sound
and
back
within
the
friendly
ordure
sank
then
i
with
a
great
sad
and
awful
voice
cried
out
o
thou
that
rottest
in
this
sty
o
thou
whose
soul
in
ordure
doth
rejoice
what
art
thou
doing
these
things
for
and
why
then
one
to
me
his
bliss
is
not
to
know
the
infiniteness
of
his
own
vanity
therefore
the
soul
of
him
that
stinketh
so
because
his
sense
is
blind
and
deaf
and
mad
forever
knoweth
not
eternal
woe
lo
from
the
first
his
soul
no
reason
had
he
thinketh
he
himself
is
everything
and
nothing
is
but
him
he
is
not
sad
ignorance
ignorance
shrouds
him
like
a
pall
therefore
thus
low
upon
the
fetid
floor
he
sits
and
knoweth
naught
outside
his
stall
and
i
he
maketh
naught
outside
his
store
why
doth
he
this
and
in
this
fetid
tomb
sitteth
he
here
in
madness
evermore
how
long
shall
iron
awful
gnashing
doom
leave
him
thus
naked
old
and
idiot
blind
deaf
and
stinking
in
the
loathed
gloom
how
long
shall
this
within
the
ordure
squat
how
long
shall
this
cease
not
to
beck
and
nod
how
long
shall
this
cease
not
to
rot
and
rot
and
he
this
rottenness
that
seemeth
god
more
woe
than
this
nor
any
other
mode
shall
know
not
till
it
ceaseth
in
the
sod
and
as
a
gnat
a
viper
or
a
toad
because
its
nature
is
not
infinite
it
too
shall
perish
in
the
worm
abode
till
then
it
suppurateth
in
the
night
iii
then
from
the
world
i
turn
my
steps
afar
i
came
there
where
the
holy
trinity
and
all
the
blessed
saints
in
glory
are
and
did
the
beatific
vision
see
and
how
those
happy
are
that
once
did
mourn
but
my
heart
said
all
this
is
naught
to
me
nor
knew
i
why
all
these
should
be
reborn
where
houris
wanton
arms
do
fling
round
mahmud
blessed
i
past
by
in
scorn
for
my
heart
dream
a
deeper
revelling
then
came
i
to
that
banquet
more
divine
that
jayadeva
and
that
jami
sing
and
the
fair
goblet
fill
full
of
the
wine
brought
the
clad
with
wantonness
and
there
with
the
beloved
and
the
vine
my
heart
grew
weary
of
that
blessedness
from
life
i
past
finding
no
joy
therein
the
vision
and
the
vine
and
drunkenness
still
like
a
circle
ever
closing
in
then
i
departed
to
the
final
peace
sick
of
what
is
and
shall
be
and
hath
been
of
brahma
as
the
drop
sinks
in
the
seas
i
past
out
from
the
bonds
of
lost
in
that
infinite
whose
being
is
glory
in
all
things
and
reality
but
therein
i
that
was
not
i
alas
in
that
deliverance
from
where
all
illusion
fadeth
like
to
grass
found
naught
that
equall
my
undimm
desire
if
that
reality
then
real
was
what
is
that
real
more
than
trodden
mire
then
from
all
being
did
my
spirit
pass
sick
of
all
being
whether
low
or
higher
out
of
that
circle
unto
nothingness
i
came
unto
nirvana
the
far
goal
of
many
a
holy
saint
where
visions
cease
but
nothingness
did
not
my
heart
console
ah
not
in
nothingness
is
any
peace
nor
in
peace
any
peace
nor
in
the
whole
nor
in
the
vine
nor
in
the
vision
nor
in
being
nor
nor
in
all
that
man
hath
dream
of
and
hath
anguisht
for
nay
not
in
joy
nor
the
vine
jovial
nor
in
the
perfume
of
the
lov
one
breath
nay
nor
in
anything
anywhere
at
all
nor
in
illusion
nor
what
sundereth
illusion
in
the
sundering
of
that
chain
there
is
no
joy
and
not
alas
in
death
find
i
that
thing
whereof
my
soul
is
fain
all
these
things
also
are
all
vanity
no
less
than
sun
and
stars
that
wax
and
wane
forever
in
the
everlasting
sky
envoi
at
the
end
of
the
century
now
i
am
come
to
the
nadir
at
last
to
the
absolute
sorrow
now
all
the
stars
are
gone
out
of
my
sky
night
everlasting
is
mine
without
hope
or
desire
of
the
morrow
all
my
life
hopes
are
gone
tombwards
to
die
all
my
life
glories
lie
perisht
around
me
and
lo
with
great
laughing
laugh
i
out
loud
and
i
care
not
at
all
here
with
mine
anguish
my
sorrow
my
madness
my
grief
i
sit
quaffing
wine
in
high
state
in
my
echoing
hall
this
is
the
last
night
i
drink
with
you
maniac
wassailers
dreary

up
your
goblets
and
drink
ere
i
go
lo
i
am
easily

i
am
easily
tired
and
made
weary
now
at
the
last
i
am
weary
of
woe
lo
i
that
walk
in
the
flower
crown
season
of
youthfulness
golden
think
ye
that
all
things
my
gladness
can
slay
sorrow
is
fitting
for
dotards
and
them
that
are
loathsome
and
olden
am
as
one
that
goes
ever
away
lo
i
laugh
out
at
grief
lo
i
laugh
in
unending
rejoicing
i
that
have
nightshade
entwin
in
my
hair
heart
of
me
what
dost
thou
here
in
the
wearisome
darkness
revoicing
yesterday
stale
and
forgotten
despair
now
it
is
midnight
but
soon
shall
the
wakening
glory
of
morning
shine
in
the
east
when
the
darkness
is
gone
now
in
my
spirit
that
sat
for
a
time
in
the
darkness
of
mourning
waketh
in
gladness
the
mystical
dawn
new
spring
laugheth
without
to
thy
heart
it
is
calling
and
thee
soon
shall
the
banners
of
dawn
be
unfurl

no
longer
o
heart
o
heart
that
art
strong
for
before
thee

the
pomp
of
the
great
high
world
now
it
is
midnight
my
anguish

mourning
my
sadness
my
sorrow
crown
you
with
nightshade
and
once
more
with
me
drink
and
make
merry
farewell
i
am
here
with
you
now
on
the
morrow
sail
i
over
the
mighty
sea
postlude
song
of
india
now
at
the
last
zulaikha
all
my
sorrows
olden
are
farther
off
than
europe
or
than
china
seem
and
like
an
idle
dream
the
north
is
faded
far
off
in
the
distance
golden
and
here
with
thee
i
sit
in
perfect
peace
enfolden
beside
the
full
well
i
knew
that
those
northern
promontories
could
give
to
me
the
dream
that
did
my
soul
desire
for
there
my
heart
did
tire
for
always
me
allur
the
strangely
whisper
stories
of
skies
that
burn
with
more
consuming
languid
glories
and
suns
of
mightier
fire
i
dream
of
heavier
suns
than
burn
in
skies
of
ours
and
heavier
airs
that
through
the
long
long
evening
swoon
under
a
larger
moon
and
gardens
fill
with
stranger
flowers
and
tropic
palms
that
wave
through
all
the
long
long
hours
of
endless
afternoon
at
last
now
from
that
northern
dream
am
i
awoken
at
last
i
am
come
home
over
the
watery
main
long
long
i
sigh
in
vain
now
under
tropic
palms
i
lie
in
peace
unbroken
and
mine
own
land
i
see
beloved
and
hear
spoken
my
natal
tongue
again
zulaikha
past
is
all
the
longing
and
endeavour
the
sleep
and
sleeping
move
not
any
leaf
perisht
is
woe
and
grief
stilly
the
padmas
float
upon
the
holy
river
among
all

with
languid

thy
prize
the
caravans
that
in

endless

slumber

there

afar
