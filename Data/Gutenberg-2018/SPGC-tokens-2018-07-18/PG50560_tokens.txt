preface
i
have
been
requested
to
write
a
preface
to
this
sad
story
of
a
century
of
dishonor
i
can
not
refuse
the
request
of
one
whose
woman
heart
has
pleaded
so
eloquently
for
the
poor
red
men
the
materials
for
her
book
have
been
taken
from
official
documents
the
sad
revelation
of
broken
faith
of
violated
treaties
and
of
inhuman
deeds
of
violence
will
bring
a
flush
of
shame
to
the
cheeks
of
those
who
love
their
country
they
will
wonder
how
our
rulers
have
dared
to
so
trifle
with
justice
and
provoke
the
anger
of
god
many
of
the
stories
will
be
new
to
the
reader
the
indian
owns
no
telegraph
employs
no
press
reporter
and
his
side
of
the
story
is
unknown
to
the
people
nations
like
individuals
reap
exactly
what
they
sow
they
who
sow
robbery
reap
robbery
the
of
iniquity
replies
in
a
harvest
of
blood
the
american
people
have
accepted
as
truth
the
teaching
that
the
indians
were
a
degraded
brutal
race
of
savages
whom
it
was
the
will
of
god
should
perish
at
the
approach
of
civilization
if
they
do
not
say
with
our
puritan
fathers
that
these
are
the
hittites
who
are
to
be
driven
out
before
the
saints
of
the
lord
they
do
accept
the
teaching
that
manifest
destiny
will
drive
the
indians
from
the
earth
the
inexorable
has
no
tears
or
pity
at
the
cries
of
anguish
of
the
doomed
race
ahab
never
speaks
kindly
of
naboth
whom
he
has
robbed
of
his
vineyard
it
soothes
conscience
to
cast
mud
on
the
character
of
the
one
whom
we
have
wronged
the
people
have
laid
the
causes
of
indian
wars
at
the
door
of
the
indian
trader
the
people
on
the
border
the
indian
agents
the
army
and
the
department
of
the
interior
none
of
these
are
responsible
for
the
indian
wars
which
have
cost
the
united
states
five
hundred
millions
of
dollars
and
tens
of
thousands
of
valuable
lives
in
the
olden
time
the
indian
trader
was
the
indian
friend
the
relation
was
one
of
mutual
dependence
if
the
trader
oppressed
the
indian
he
was
in
danger
of
losing
his
debt
if
the
indian
refused
to
pay
his
debts
the
trader
must
leave
the
country
the
factors
and
agents
of
the
old
fur
companies
tell
us
that
their
goods
were
as
safe
in
the
unguarded
as
in
the
civilized
village
the
pioneer
settlers
have
had
too
much
at
stake
to
excite
an
indian
massacre
which
would
overwhelm
their
loved
ones
in
ruin
the
army
are
not
responsible
for
indian
wars
they
are
men
under
authority
who
go
where
they
are
sent
the
men
who
represent
the
honor
of
the
nation
have
a
tradition
that
lying
is
a
disgrace
and
that
theft
forfeits
character
general
crook
expressed
the
feeling
of
the
army
when
he
replied
to
a
friend
who
said
it
is
hard
to
go
on
such
a
campaign
yes
it
is
hard
but
sir
the
hardest
thing
is
to
go
and
fight
those
whom
you
know
are
in
the
right
the
indian
bureau
is
often
unable
to
fulfil
the
treaties
because
congress
has
failed
to
make
the
appropriations
if
its
agents
are
not
men
of
the
highest
character
it
is
largely
due
to
the
fact
that
we
send
a
man
to
execute
this
difficult
trust
at
a
remote
agency
and
expect
him
to
support
himself
and
family
on
a
year
the
indian
bureau
represents
a
system
which
is
a
blunder
and
a
crime
the
indian
is
the
only
human
being
within
our
territory
who
has
no
individual
right
in
the
soil
he
is
not
amenable
to
or
protected
by
law
the
executive
the
legislative
and
judicial
departments
of
the
government
recognize
that
he
has
a
possessory
right
in
the
soil
but
his
title
is
merged
in
the
man
has
no
standing
before
the
law
a
chinese
or
a
hottentot
would
have
but
the
native
american
is
left
pitiably
helpless
this
system
grew
out
of
our
relations
at
the
first
settlement
of
the
country
the
isolated
settlements
along
the
atlantic
coast
could
not
ask
the
indians
who
outnumbered
them
ten
to
one
to
accept
the
position
of
wards
no
wise
policy
was
adopted
with
altered
circumstances
to
train
the
indians
for
citizenship
treaties
were
made
of
the
same
binding
force
of
the
constitution
but
these
treaties
were
unfilled
it
may
be
doubted
whether
one
single
treaty
has
ever
been
fulfilled
as
it
would
have
been
if
it
had
been
made
with
a
foreign
power
the
treaty
has
been
made
as
between
two
independent
sovereigns
sometimes
each
party
has
been
ignorant
of
the
wishes
of
the
other
for
the
heads
of
both
parties
to
the
treaty
have
been
on
the
shoulders
and
he
was
the
owned
creature
of
corrupt
men
who
desired
to
use
the
indians
as
a
key
to
unlock
the
nation
treasury
pledges
solemnly
made
have
been
shamelessly
violated
the
indian
has
had
no
redress
but
war
in
these
wars
ten
white
men
were
killed
to
one
indian
and
the
indians
who
were
killed
have
cost
the
government
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
each
then
came
a
new
treaty
more
violated
faith
another
war
until
we
have
not
a
hundred
miles
between
the
atlantic
and
pacific
which
has
not
been
the
scene
of
an
indian
massacre
all
this
while
canada
has
had
no
indian
wars
our
government
has
expended
for
the
indians
a
hundred
dollars
to
their
one
they
recognize
as
we
do
that
the
indian
has
a
possessory
right
to
the
soil
they
purchase
this
right
as
we
do
by
treaty
but
their
treaties
are
made
with
indian
of
her
majesty
they
set
apart
a
reservation
for
them
they
seldom
remove
indians
they
select
agents
of
high
character
who
receive
their
appointments
for
life
they
make
fewer
promises
but
they
fulfil
them
they
give
the
indians
christian
missions
which
have
the
hearty
support
of
christian
people
and
all
their
efforts
are
toward
and
civilization
an
incident
will
illustrate
the
two
systems
the
officer
of
the
united
states
army
who
was
sent
to
receive
alaska
from
the
russian
government
stopped
in
british
columbia
governor
douglas
had
heard
that
an
indian
had
been
murdered
by
another
indian
he
visited
the
indian
tribe
he
explained
to
them
that
the
murdered
man
was
a
subject
of
her
majesty
he
demanded
the
culprit
the
murderer
was
surrendered
was
tried
was
found
guilty
and
was
hanged
on
reaching
alaska
the
officer
happened
to
enter
the
greek
church
and
saw
on
the
altar
a
beautiful
copy
of
the
gospels
in
a
costly
binding
studded
with
jewels
he
called
upon
the
greek
bishop
and
said
your
grace
i
called
to
say
you
had
better
remove
that
copy
of
the
gospels
from
the
church
for
it
may
be
stolen
the
bishop
replied
why
should
i
remove
it
it
was
the
gift
of
the
mother
of
the
emperor
and
has
lain
on
the
altar
seventy
years
the
officer
blushed
and
said
there
is
no
law
in
the
indian
country
and
i
was
afraid
it
might
be
stolen
the
bishop
said
the
book
is
in
god
house
and
it
is
his
book
and
i
shall
not
take
it
away
the
book
remained
the
country
became
ours
and
the
next
day
the
gospel
was
stolen
our
indian
wars
are
needless
and
wicked
the
north
american
indian
is
the
noblest
type
of
a
heathen
man
on
the
earth
he
recognizes
a
great
spirit
he
believes
in
immortality
he
has
a
quick
intellect
he
is
a
clear
thinker
he
is
brave
and
fearless
and
until
betrayed
he
is
true
to
his
plighted
faith
he
has
a
passionate
love
for
his
children
and
counts
it
joy
to
die
for
his
people
our
most
terrible
wars
have
been
with
the
noblest
types
of
the
indians
and
with
men
who
had
been
the
white
man
friend
nicolet
said
the
sioux
were
the
finest
type
of
wild
men
he
had
ever
seen
old
traders
say
that
it
used
to
be
the
boast
of
the
sioux
that
they
had
never
taken
the
life
of
a
white
man
lewis
and
clarke
governor
stevens
and

steptoe
bore
testimony
to
the
devoted
friendship
of
the

the
white

colonel
boone
colonel
bent
general
harney
and
others
speak
in
the
highest
praise
of
the
cheyennes
the
navahoes
were
a
people
our
best
friends
have
suffered
more
deeply
from
our
neglect
and
violated
faith
than
our
most
bitter
foes
peaceable
indians
often
say
you
leave
us
to
suffer
if
we
killed
your
people
then
you
would
take
care
of
us
our
indian
wars
have
not
come
wholly
from
violated
faith
in
time
of
peace
it
has
been
our
policy
to
establish
almshouses
to
train
and
educate
savage
paupers
we
have
purchased
paint
beads
to
deck
warriors
and
have
fed
them
in
idleness
at
the
agency
around
this
agency
and
along
the
border
were
gathered
influences
to
degrade
the
savage
and
sink
him
to
a
depth
his
fathers
had
never
known
it
has
only
needed
a
real
or
a
fancied
wrong
to
have
this
pauperized
savagery
break
out
in
deeds
of
blood
under
president
grant
a
new
departure
was
taken
the
peace
policy
was
little
more
than
a
name
no
change
was
made
in
the
indian
system
no
rights
of
property
were
given
no
laws
were
passed
to
protect
the
indians
the
president
did
take
the
nomination
of
indian
agents
from
politicians
who
had
made
the
office
a
reward
for
political
service
he
gave
the
nomination
of
indian
agents
to
the
executive
committees
of
the
missionary
societies
of
the
different
churches
where
these
christian
bodies
established
schools
and
missions
and
the
government
cast
its
influence
on
the
side
of
labor
it
was
a
success
more
has
been
done
to
civilize
the
indians
in
the
past
twelve
years
than
in
any
period
of
our
history
the
indian
ring
has
fought
the
new
policy
at
every
step
and
yet
notwithstanding
our
indian
wars
our
violated
treaties
and
our
wretched
system
thousands
of
indians
who
were
poor
degraded
savages
are
now
living
as
christian
civilized
men
there
was
a
time
when
it
seemed
impossible
to
secure
the
attention
of
the
government
to
any
wrongs
done
to
the
indians
it
is
not
so
the
government
does
listen
to
the
friends
of
the
indians
and
many
of
the
grosser
forms
of
robbery
are
stopped
no
permanent
reform
can
be
secured
until
the
heart
of
the
people
is
touched
in
i
visited
washington
to
lay
before
the
administration
the
causes
which
had
desolated
our
fair
state
with
the
blood
of
those
slain
by
indian
massacre
after
pleading
in
vain
and
finding
no
redress
secretary
stanton
said
to
a
friend
what
does
the
bishop
want
if
he
came
here
to
tell
us
that
our
indian
system
is
a
sink
of
iniquity
tell
him
we
all
know
it
tell
him
the
united
states
never
cures
a
wrong
until
the
people
demand
it
and
when
the
hearts
of
the
people
are
reached
the
indian
will
be
saved
in
this
book
the
reader
will
find
the
sad
story
of
a
not
the
whole
story
but
the
fragmentary
story
of
isolated
tribes
the
author
will
have
her
reward
if
it
shall
aid
in
securing
justice
to
a
noble
and
a
wronged
race
even
with
the
sad
experiences
of
the
past
we
have
not
learned
justice
the
cherokees
and
other
tribes
received
the
indian
territory
as
a
compensation
and
atonement
for
one
of
the
darkest
crimes
ever
committed
by
a
christian
nation
that
territory
was
conveyed
to
them
by
legislation
as
strong
as
the
wit
of
statesmen
could
devise
the
fathers
who
conveyed
this
territory
to
the
cherokees
are
dead
greedy
eyes
covet
the
land
the
plans
are
laid
to
wrest
it
from
its
rightful
owners
if
this
great
iniquity
is
consummated
these
indians
declare
that
all
hope
in
our
justice
will
die
out
of
their
hearts
and
that
they
will
defend
their
country
with
their
lives
the
work
of
reform
is
a
difficult
one
it
will
cost
us
time
effort
and
money
it
will
demand
the
best
thoughts
of
the
best
men
in
the
country
we
shall
have
to
regain
the
confidence
of
our
indian
wards
by
honest
dealing
and
the
fulfilment
of
our
promises

the

of

does

three
hundred
thousand

is
possibly
as
large
now

when
the

began

to
believe
that
the
vast
territory
now
occupied
by
the
united
states
if
not
then
a
howling
wilderness
was
largely
an
unpeopled
solitude
the
roaming
wild
men
who
met
the
new
discoverers
were
however
numerous
enough
to
make
the
indian
problem
at
the
outset
a
serious
one
while
neither
its
gravity
nor
its
difficulty
yet
shows
signs
of
diminution
the
difficulty
is
not
because
the
indians
are
wild
and
savage
men
for
such
men
have
in
the
past
history
of
the
human
race
been
subdued
and
civilized
in
unnumbered
instances
while
the
changes
which
in
our
time
have
been
wrought
among
the
cannibals
of
the
south
sea
and
the
barbarians
of
south
africa
and
among
the
wildest
and
most
savage
of
the
north
american
indians
themselves
show
abundantly
that
the
agencies
of
civilization
ready
to
our
hand
are
neither
wanting
nor
weak
the
great
difficulty
with
the
indian
problem
is
not
with
the
indian
but
with
the
government
and
people
of
the
united
states
instead
of
a
liberal
and
policy
looking
to
the
education
and
civilization
and
possible
citizenship
of
the
indian
tribes
we
have
suffered
these
people
to
remain
as
savages
for
whose
future
we
have
had
no
adequate
care
and
to
the
consideration
of
whose
present
state
the
government
has
only
been
moved
when
pressed
by
some
present
danger
we
have
encroached
upon
their
means
of
subsistence
without
furnishing
them
any
proper
return
we
have
shut
them
up
on
reservations
often
notoriously
unfit
for
them
or
if
fit
we
have
not
hesitated
to
drive
them
off
for
our
profit
without
regard
to
theirs
we
have
treated
them
sometimes
as
foreign
nations
with
whom
we
have
had
treaties
sometimes
as
wards
who
are
entitled
to
no
voice
in
the
management
of
their
affairs
and
sometimes
as
subjects
from
whom
we
have
required
obedience
but
to
whom
we
have
recognized
no
obligations
that
the
government
of
the
united
states
which
has
often
plighted
its
faith
to
the
indian
and
has
broken
it
as
often
and
while
punishing
him
for
his
crimes
has
given
him
no
status
in
the
courts
except
as
a
criminal
has
been
sadly
derelict
in
its
duty
toward
him
and
has
reaped
the
whirlwind
only
because
it
has
sown
the
wind
is
set
forth
in
no
exaggerated
terms
in
the
following
pages
and
ought
to
be
acknowledged
with
shame
by
every
american
citizen
it
will
be
admitted
now
on
every
hand
that
the
only
solution
of
the
indian
problem
involves
the
entire
change
of
these
people
from
a
savage
to
a
civilized
life
they
are
not
likely
to
be
exterminated
unless
we
ourselves
withdraw
from
all
contact
with
them
and
leave
them
to
roam
untrammeled
over
their
wilds
or
until
the
power
of
a
christian
civilization
shall
make
them
consciously
one
with
us
they
will
not
cease
to
vex
us
but
how
shall
they
become
civilized
civilization
is
in
a
most
important
sense
a
gift
rather
than
an
acquisition
men
do
not
gain
it
for
themselves
except
as
stimulated
thereto
by
some
incitement
from
above
themselves
the
savage
does
not
labor
for
the
gratifications
of
civilized
life
since
he
does
not
desire
these
his
labors
and
his
desires
are
both
dependent
upon
some
spiritual
gift
which
having
kindled
him
quickens
his
desires
and
calls
forth
his
toil
unless
he
has
some
help
from
without
some
light
and
life
from
above
to
illumine
and
inspire
him
the
savage
remains
a
savage
and
without
this
all
the
blandishments
of
the
civilization
with
which
he
might
be
brought
into
contact
could
no
more
win
him
into
a
better
state
than
could
all
the
light
and
warmth
of
the
sun
woo
a
desert
into
a
fruitful
field
when
english
missionaries
went
to
the
indians
in
canada
they
took
with
them
skilled
laborers
who
should
teach
the
indians
how
to
labor
and
who
by
providing
them
at
first
with
comfortable
houses
and
clothing
and
food
should
awaken
their
desires
and
evoke
their
efforts
to
perpetuate
and
increase
these
comforts
but
the
indian
would
not
work
and
preferred
his
wigwam
and
skins
and
raw
flesh
and
filth
to
the
cleanliness
and
conveniences
of
a
civilized
home
and
it
was
only
as
christian
influences
taught
him
his
inner
need
and
how
this
could
be
supplied
that
he
was
led
to
wish
and
work
for
the
improvement
of
his
outer
condition
and
habits
of
life
the
same
is
true
everywhere
civilization
does
not
reproduce
itself
it
must
first
be
kindled
and
can
then
only
be
kept
alive
by
a
power
genuinely
christian
but
it
is
idle
to
attempt
to
carry
christian
influences
to
any
one
unless
we
are
christian
the
first
step
therefore
toward
the
desired
transformation
of
the
indian
is
a
transformed
treatment
of
him
by
ourselves
in
sober
earnest
our
government
needs
first
of
all
to
be
christian
and
to
treat
the
indian
question
as
christian
principles
require
this
means
at
the
outset
that
we
should
be
honest
and
not
talk
about
maintaining
our
rights
until
we
are
willing
to
fulfil
our
obligations
it
means
that
we
should
be
kind
and
quite
as
eager
to
give
the
indian
what
is
ours
as
to
get
what
is
his
it
means
that
we
should
be
wise
and
patient
and
persevering
abandoning
all
makeshifts
and
temporary
expedients
and
setting
it
before
us
as
our
fixed
aim
to
act
toward
him
as
a
brother
until
he
shall
act
as
a
brother
toward
us
there
is
no
use
to
attempt
to
teach
christian
duty
to
him
in
words
till
he
has
first
seen
it
exemplified
in
our
own
deeds
the
true
christian
principle
of
honesty
and
kindness
clearly
and
continuously
exhibited
is
the
first
requisite
of
true
statesmanship
in
the
treatment
of
the
indian
question
this
would
not
require
however
the
immediate
entrance
of
the
indian
upon
all
the
privileges
of
citizenship
and
christianized
though
he
might
be
he
would
need
for
a
longer
or
shorter
time
guardianship
like
a
child
a
wise
care
for
his
own
interests
could
not
be
expected
of
him
at
the
outset
and
the
government
should
care
for
him
with
wise
forethought
obedience
to
the
law
should
be
required
of
him
and
the
protection
of
the
law
afforded
him
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
and
the
presence
of
the
government
should
be
felt
in
the
indian
territory
and
upon
every
indian
reservation
as
powerfully
as
in
the
most
enlightened
portions
of
the
land
the
court
should
go
as
early
as
the
school
if
not
before
and
is
itself
an
educational
agency
of
incalculable
importance
when
the
indian
through
wise
and
christian
treatment
becomes
invested
with
all
the
rights
and
duties
of
citizenship
his
special
tribal
relations
will
become
extinct
this
will
not
be
easily
nor
rapidly
done
but
all
our
policy
should
be
shaped
toward
the
gradual
loosening
of
the
tribal
bond
and
the
gradual
absorption
of
the
indian
families
among
the
masses
of
our
people
this
would
involve
the
bringing
to
an
end
of
the
whole
system
of
indian
reservations
and
would
forbid
the
continued
isolation
of
the
indian
territory
it
is
not
wise
statesmanship
to
create
impassable
barriers
between
any
parts
of
our
country
or
any
portions
of
our
people
very
difficult
questions
demanding
very
careful
treatment
arise
in
reference
to
just
this
point
certain
indian
tribes
now
own
certain
indian
reservations
and
the
indian
territory
and
this
right
of
property
ought
to
be
most
sacredly
guarded
but
it
does
not
therefore
follow
that
these
indians
in
their
present
state
ought
to
control
the
present
use
of
this
property
they
may
need
a
long
training
before
they
are
wise
enough
to
manage
rightfully
what
is
nevertheless
rightfully
their
own
this
training
to
which
their
property
might
fairly
contribute
means
should
assiduously
be
given
in
established
schools
with
required
attendance
if
the
results
thus
indicated
shall
gradually
come
to
pass
the
property
now
owned
by
the
tribes
should
be
ultimately
divided
and
held
in
severalty
by
the
individual
members
of
the
tribes
such
a
division
should
not
be
immediately
made
and
when
made
it
should
be
with
great
care
and
faithfulness
but
the
indian
himself
should
as
soon
as
may
be
feel
both
the
incentives
and
the
restraints
which
an
individual
ownership
of
property
is
fitted
to
excite
and
the
government
which
is
his
guardian
having
educated
him
for
this
ownership
should
endow
him
with
it
but
until
the
indian
becomes
as
able
as
is
the
average
white
man
to
manage
his
property
for
himself
the
government
should
manage
it
for
him
no
matter
whether
he
be
willing
or
unwilling
to
have
this
done
a
difficulty
arises
in
the
which
there
are
treaties
have
been
made
by
the
government
of
the
united
states
with
different
indian
tribes
wherein
the
two
parties
have
agreed
to
certain
definitely
named
stipulations
such
treaties
have
proceeded
upon
the
false
in
principle
and
equally
false
in
an
indian
tribe
roaming
in
the
wilderness
and
living
by
hunting
and
plunder
is
a
nation
in
order
to
be
a
nation
there
must
be
a
people
with
a
code
of
laws
which
they
practise
and
a
government
which
they
maintain
no
vague
sense
of
some
unwritten
law
to
which
human
nature
in
its
lowest
stages
doubtless
feels
some
obligation
and
no
regulations
instinctively
adopted
for
common
defence
which
the
rudest
people
herded
together
will
always
follow
are
enough
to
constitute
a
nation
these
indian
tribes
are
not
a
nation
and
nothing
either
in
their
history
or
their
condition
could
properly
invest
them
with
a
power
and
yet
when
exigencies
have
seemed
to
require
we
have
treated
them
as
nations
and
have
pledged
our
own
national
faith
in
solemn
covenant
with
them
it
were
the
baldest
truism
to
say
that
this
faith
and
covenant
should
be
fulfilled
of
course
it
should
be
fulfilled
it
is
to
our
own
unspeakable
disgrace
that
we
have
so
often
failed
therein
but
it
becomes
us
wisely
and
honestly
to
inquire
whether
the
spirit
of
these
agreements
might
not
be
falsified
by
their
letter
and
whether
in
order
to
give
the
indian
his
real
rights
it
may
not
be
necessary
to
set
aside
prerogatives
to
which
he
might
technically
and
formally
lay
claim
if
the
indian
territory
and
the
indian
reservations
have
been
given
to
certain
tribes
as
their
possession
forever
the
sacredness
of
this
guarantee
should
not
shut
our
eyes
to
the
sacredness
also
of
the
real
interests
of
the
people
in
whose
behalf
the
guarantee
was
given
we
ought
not
to
lose
the
substance
in
our
efforts
to
retain
the
shadow
we
ought
not
to
insist
upon
the
when
this
would
become
the
of
course
the
utmost
caution
is
needed
in
the
application
of
such
a
principle
to
admit
that
a
treaty
with
the
indians
may
be
set
aside
without
the
consent
of
the
indians
themselves
is
to
open
the
door
again
to
the
same
frauds
and
falsehoods
which
have
so
darkly
branded
a
century
of
dishonor
but
our
great
trouble
has
been
that
we
have
sought
to
exact
justice
from
the
indian
while
exhibiting
no
justice
to
him
and
when
we
shall
manifest
that
all
our
procedure
toward
him
is
in
truth
and
uprightness
we
need
have
no
fear
but
that
both
his
conscience
and
his
judgment
will
in
the
end
approve

introductory
the
question
of
the
honorableness
of
the
united
states
dealings
with
the
indians
turns
largely
on
a
much
disputed
and
little
understood
point
what
was
the
nature
of
the
indians
right
to
the
country
in
which
they
were
living
when
the
continent
of
north
america
was
discovered
between
the
theory
of
some
sentimentalists
that
the
indians
were
the
real
owners
of
the
soil
and
the
theory
of
some
politicians
that
they
had
no
right
of
ownership
whatever
in
it
there
are
innumerable
grades
and
confusions
of
opinion
the
only
authority
on
the
point
must
be
the
view
and
usage
as
accepted
by
the
great
discovering
powers
at
the
time
of
discovery
and
afterward
in
their
disposition
of
the
lands
discovered
fortunately
an
honest
examination
of
these
points
leaves
no
doubt
on
the
matter

of

the
indians
right

as
a
right
a
right
alienable
in
but
two
ways
either
by
purchase
or
by
conquest
all
their
discussions
as
to
boundaries
from
down
to
recognized
this
right
and
this
principle
they
reiterated
firstly
that
discoverers
had
the
right
of
right
in
so
far
absolute
that
the
discoverer
was
empowered
by
it
not
only
to
take
possession
of
but
to
grant
sell
and
convey
lands
still
occupied
by
that
for
any
nation
to
attempt
to
take
possession
of
grant
sell
or
convey
any
such
lands
while
said
lands
were
claimed
by
other
nations
under
the
right
of
discovery
was
an
infringement
of
rights
and
just
occasion
of
war
secondly
that
all
this
granting
selling
conveying
was
to
be
understood
to
be
subject
to
the
indians
right
of
occupancy
which
remained
to
be
extinguished
either
through
further
purchase
or
through
conquest
by
the
grantee
or
purchaser

in
his
preface
to
the
seventh
volume
of
the
united
states
statutes
at
large
says
the
history
of
america
from
its
discovery
to
the
present
day
proves
the
universal
recognition
of
these
principles
each
discovering
power
might
regulate
the
relations
between
herself
and
the
indians
but
as
to
the
existence
of
the
indians
right
of
occupancy
there
was
absolute
unanimity
among
them
that
there
should
have
been
unanimity
regarding
any
one
thing
between
them
is
remarkable
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
realize
what
a
sudden
invitation
to
greed
and
discord
lay
in
this
fair
beautiful
unclaimed
millions
of
square
miles
of
than
twice
the
size
of
all
europe
itself
what
a
lure
would
such
another
new
continent
prove
the
fighting
over
it
would
be
as
fierce
now
as
the
fighting
was
then
and
the
right
of
occupancy
of
the
natives
would
stand
small
chance
of
such
unanimous
recognition
as
the
four
great
powers
then
justly
gave
it
of
the
fairness
of
holding
that
ultimate
sovereignty
belonged
to
the
civilized
discoverer
as
against
the
savage
barbarian
there
is
no
manner
nor
ground
of
doubt
to
question
this
is
feeble
sentimentalism
but
to
affirm
and
uphold
this
is
not
in
any
wise
to
overlook
the
lesser
right
which
remained
as
good
of
its
kind
and
to
its
extent
as
was
the
greater
right
to
which
in
the
just
nature
of
things
it
was
bound
to
give
way
it
being
clear
then
that
the
indians
right
of
occupancy
was
a
right
recognized
by
all
the
great
discovering
powers
acted
upon
by
them
in
all
their
dispositions
of
lands
here
discovered
it
remains
next
to
inquire
whether
the
united
states
government
on
taking
its
place
among
the
nations
also

of

reiterates
the

has
been
recognized
in
countless
ways
among
others
by
many
decisions
of
courts
and
opinions
of
it
being
thus
established
that
the
indian
right
of
occupancy
in
his
lands
was
a
right
recognized
by
all
the
great
powers
discovering
this
continent
and
accepted
by
them
as
a
right
necessary
to
be
extinguished
either
by
purchase
or
conquest
and
that
the
united
states
as
a
nation
has
also
from
the
beginning
recognized
accepted
and
acted
upon
this
theory
it
is
next
in
order
to
inquire
whether
the
united
states
has
dealt
honorably
or
dishonorably
by
the
indians
in
this
matter
of
their
recognized
right
of
occupancy
in
regard
to
the
actions
of
individuals
there
is
rarely
much
room
for
discussion
whether
they
be
honorable
or
dishonorable
the
standard
of
honor
in
men
conduct
being
among
the
civilized
uniform
well
understood
and
undisputed
stealing
for
instance
is
everywhere
held
to
be
dishonorable
as
well
as
impolitic
lying
also
in
all
its
forms
breaking
of

and
betrayals
of

are
scorned
even
among

most
ignorant

but
when
it
comes
to
the
discussion

acts

there
seems
to
be
less
clearness
of
conception
less
uniformity
of
standard
of
right
and
wrong
honor
and
dishonor
it
is
necessary
therefore
in
charging
a
government

nation
with
dishonorable
conduct
to
show
that
its
moral
standard
ought
in
nowise
to
differ
from
the

in

do
this
it
is

look

and

founded
on
the
general
nature
of

nevertheless
of
these
two
forms
of
the
same
idea
the
first
ought
to
be
considered
as
predominant
since
it
as
well
as
the
civile
was
a
positive
law
the
origin
and

of
which
must
be
sought
for

being
simply
as

is
plain
that
if
there
be
such
a
thing
as

obey
that

men
under
whatever
relation
they
act
this
is
the
law
which
grotius
and
those
who
follow
him
call
the
internal
law
of
nations
on
account
of
its
being
obligatory
on
nations
in
the
point
of
conscience
vattel
says
again
nations
being
composed
of
men
naturally
free
and
independent
and
who
before
the
establishment
of
civil
societies
lived
together
in
the
state
of
nature
nations
or
sovereign
states
are
to
be
considered
as
so
many
free
persons
living
together
in
the
state
of
nature
and
again
since
men
are
naturally
equal
and
a
perfect
equality
prevails
in
their
right
and
obligations
as
equally
proceeding
from
nature
nations
composed
of
men
and
considered
as
so
many
free
persons
living
together
in
the
state
of
nature
are
naturally
equal
and
inherit
from
nature
the
same
obligations
and
rights
power
or
weakness
does
not
in
this
respect
produce
any
difference
a
dwarf
is
as
much
a
man
as
a
giant
a
small
republic
no
less
a
sovereign
state
than
the
most
powerful
kingdom
in
these
two
last
sentences
is
touched
the
of
the
true
law
of
nations
as
well
as
of
the
true
law
for
there
is
among
some
of
the
later
writers
on
jurisprudence
a
certain
fashion
of
condescending
speech
in
their
quotations
from
vattel
as
years
have
gone
on
and
states
have
grown
more
powerful
and
their
relations
more
complicated
by
reason
of
selfishness
and
riches
less
and
less
has
been
said
about
the
law
of
nature
as
a
component
and
unalterable
part
of
the
law
of
nations
fine
subtleties
of
definition
of
limitation
have
been
attempted
hundreds
of
pages
are
full
of
apparently
learned
discriminations
between
the
parts
of
that
law
which
are
based
on
the
law
of
nature
and
the
parts
which
are
based
on
the
consent
and
usage
of
nations
but
the
two
can
not
be
separated
no
amount
of
legality
of
phrase
can
do
away
with
the
inalienable
truth
underlying
it
wheaton
and
president
woolsey
say
in
effect
the
same
thing
which
grotius
said
in
and
vattel
in
says
wheaton
international
law
as
understood
among
civilized
nations
may
be
defined
as
consisting
of
those
rules
of
conduct
which
reason
deduces
as
consonant
to
justice
from
the
nature
of
the
society
existing
among
independent
nations
president
woolsey
says
international
law
in
a
wide
and
abstract
sense
would
embrace
those
rules
of
intercourse
between
nations
which
are
deduced
from
their
rights
and
moral
claims
or
in
other
words
it
is
the
expression
of
the
jural
and
moral
relations
of
states
to
one
another
if
international
law
were
not
made
up
of
rules
for
which
reasons
could
be
given
satisfactory
to
man
intellectual
and
moral
nature
if
it
were
not
built
on
principles
of
right
it
would
be
even
less
of
a
science
than
is
the
code
which
governs
the
actions
of
polite
society
it
is
evident
therefore
that
the
one
fundamental
right
of
which
the
law
of
nations
is
at
once
the
expression
and
the
guardian
is
the
right
of
every
nation
to
just
treatment
from
other
nations
the
right
of
even
the
smallest
republic
equally
with
the
most
powerful
kingdom
just
as
the
one
fundamental
right
of
which
civil
law
is
the
expression
and
guardian
is
the
right
of
each
individual
to
just
treatment
from
every
other
individual
a
right
indefeasible
inalienable
in
nowise
lessened
by
weakness
or
strengthened
by
majestic
in
the
person
of
the
dwarf
as
in
that
of
the
giant
of
justice
vattel
says
justice
is
the
basis
of
all
society
the
sure
bond
of
all
commerce
all
nations
are
under
a
strict
obligation
to
cultivate
justice
toward
each
other
to
observe
it
scrupulously
and
carefully
to
abstain
from
anything
that
may
violate
it
the
right
of
refusing
to
submit
to
injustice
of
resisting
injustice
by
force
if
necessary
is
part
of
the
law
of
nature
and
as
such
recognized
by
the
law
of
nations
in
vain
would
nature
give
us
a
right
to
refuse
submitting
to
injustice
in
vain
would
she
oblige
others
to
be
just
in
their
dealings
with
us
if
we
could
not
lawfully
make
use
of
force
when
they
refused
to
discharge
this
duty
the
just
would
lie
at
the
mercy
of
avarice
and
injustice
and
all
their
rights
would
soon
become
useless
from
the
foregoing
right
arise
as
two
distinct
branches
first
the
right
of
a
just
defence
which
belongs
to
every
nation
or
the
right
of
making
war
against
whoever
attacks
her
and
her
rights
and
this
is
the
foundation
of
defensive
war
secondly
the
right
to
obtain
justice
by
force
if
we
can
not
obtain
it
otherwise
or
to
pursue
our
right
by
force
of
arms
this
is
the
foundation
of
offensive
war
justice
is
pledged
by
men
to
each
other
by
means
of
promises
or
contracts
what
promises
and
contracts
are
between
men
treaties
are
between
nations
president
woolsey
says
a
contract
is
one
of
the
highest
acts
of
human
it
is
the
will
binding
itself
in
regard
to
the
future
and
surrendering
its
right
to
change
a
certain
expressed
intention
so
that
it
becomes
morally
and
jurally
a
wrong
to
act
otherwise
national
contracts
are
even
more
solemn
and
sacred
than
private
ones
on
account
of
the
great
interests
involved
of
the
deliberateness
with
which
the
obligations
are
assumed
of
the
permanence
and
generality
of
the
obligations
measured
by
the
national
life
and
including
thousands
of
particular
cases
and
of
each
nation
calling
under
god
to
be
a
teacher
of
right
to
all
within
and
without
its
borders
vattel
says
it
is
a
settled
point
in
natural
law
that
he
who
has
made
a
promise
to
any
one
has
conferred
upon
him
a
real
right
to
require
the
thing
promised
and
consequently
that
the
breach
of
a
perfect
promise
is
a
violation
of
another
person
right
and
as
evidently
an
act
of
injustice
as
it
would
be
to
rob
a
man
of
his
property
there
would
no
longer
be
any
security
no
longer
any
commerce
between
mankind
if
they
did
not
think
themselves
obliged
to
keep
faith
with
each
other
and
to
perform
their
promises
it
is
evident
that
the
whole
weight
of
the
recognized
and
accepted
law
of
nations
is
thrown
on
the
side
of
justice
between
nation
and
nation
and
is
the
recognized
and
accepted
standard
of
the
obligation
involved
in
compacts
between
nation
and
nation
we
must
look
then
among
the
accepted
declarations
of
the
law
of
nations
for
the
just
and
incontrovertible
measure
of
the
shame
of
breaking
national
compacts
and
of
the
wickedness
of
the
nations
that
dare
to
do
it
we
shall
go
back
to
the
earliest
days
of
the
world
and
find
no
dissent
from
no
qualification
of
the
verdict
of
the
infamy
of
such
acts
livy
says
of
leagues
leagues
are
such
agreements
as
are
made
by
the
command
of
the
supreme
power
and
whereby
the
whole
nation
is
made
liable
to
the
wrath
of
god
if
they
infringe
it
grotius
opens
his
admonition
in
conclusion
of
the
third
book
of
his
famous
rights
of
war
and
peace
as
follows
it
is
by
faith
saith
cicero
not
commonwealths
only
but
that
grand
society
of
nations
is
maintained
away
this
saith
aristotle
all
human
commerce
fails
it
is
therefore
an
execrable
thing
to
break
faith
on
which
so
many
lives
depend
is
saith
seneca
best
ornament
wherewith
god
hath
beautified
the
rational
soul
the
strongest
support
of
human
society
which
ought
so
much
the
more
inviolably
to
be
kept
by
sovereign
princes
by
how
much
they
may
sin
with
greater
license
and
impunity
than
other
men
wherefore
take
away
faith
and
men
are
more
fierce
and
cruel
than
savage
beasts
whose
rage
all
men
do
horribly
dread
justice
indeed
in
all
other
of
her
parts
hath
something
that
is
obscure
but
that
whereunto
we
engage
our
faith
is
of
itself
clear
and
evident
yea
and
to
this
very
end
do
men
pawn
their
faith
that
in
their
negotiations
one
with
another
all
doubts
may
be
taken
away
and
every
scruple
removed
how
much
more
then
doth
it
concern
kings
to
keep
their
faith
inviolate
as
well
for
conscience
sake
as
in
regard
to
their
honor
and
reputation
wherein
consists
the
authority
of
a
kingdom
vattel
says
treaties
are
no
better
than
empty
words
if
nations
do
not
consider
them
as
respectable
engagements
as
rules
which
are
to
be
inviolably
observed
by
sovereigns
and
held
sacred
throughout
the
whole
earth
the
faith
of
firm
and
sincere
resolution
that
invariable
constancy
in
fulfilling
our
engagements
of
which
we
make
profession
in
a
therefore
to
be
held
sacred
and
inviolable
between
the
nations
of
the
earth
whose
safety
and
repose
it
secures
and
if
mankind
be
not
wilfully
deficient
in
their
duty
to
themselves
infamy
must
ever
be
the
portion
of
him
who
violates
his
faith
he
who
violates
his
treaties
violates
at
the
same
time
the
law
of
nations
for
he
disregards
the
faith
of
treaties
that
faith
which
the
law
of
nations
declares
sacred
and
so
far
as
dependent
on
him
he
renders
it
vain
and
ineffectual
doubly
guilty
he
does
an
injury
to
his
ally
and
he
does
an
injury
to
all
nations
and
inflicts
a
wound
on
the
great
society
of
mankind
on
the
observance
and
execution
of
treaties
said
a
respectable
sovereign
depends
all
the
security
which
princes
and
states
have
with
respect
to
each
other
and
no
dependence
could
henceforward
be
placed
in
future
conventions
if
the
existing
ones
were
not
to
be
observed
it
is
sometimes
said
by
those
seeking
to
defend
or
at
least
palliate
the
united
states
government
repeated
disregard
of
its
treaties
with
the
indians
that
no
congress
can
be
held
responsible
for
the
acts
of
the
congress
preceding
it
or
can
bind
the
congress
following
it
or
in
other
words
that
each
congress
may
if
it
chooses
undo
all
that
has
been
done
by
previous
congresses
however
true
this
may
be
of
some
legislative
acts
it
is
clearly
not
true
according
to
the
principles
of
international
law
of
treaties
on
this
point
vattel
says
since
public
treaties
even
those
of
a
personal
nature
concluded
by
a
king
or
by
another
sovereign
who
is
invested
with
sufficient
power
are
treaties
of
state
and
obligatory
on
the
whole
nation
real
treaties
which
were
intended
to
subsist
independently
of
the
person
who
has
concluded
them
are
undoubtedly
binding
on
his
successors
and
the
obligation
which
such
treaties
impose
on
the
state
passes
successively
to
all
her
rulers
as
soon
as
they
assume
the
public
authority
the
case
is
the
same
with
respect
to
the
rights
acquired
by
those
treaties
they
are
acquired
for
the
state
and
successively
pass
to
her
conductors
von
martens
says
treaties
properly
so
called
are
either
personal
or
real
they
are
personal
when
their
continuation
in
force
depends
on
the
person
of
the
sovereign
or
his
family
with
whom
they
have
been
contracted
they
are
real
when
their
duration
depends
on
the
state
independently
of
the
person
who
contracts
consequently
all
treaties
between
republics
must
be
real
all
treaties
made
for
a
time
specified
or
forever
are
real
this
division
is
of
the
greatest
importance
because
real
treaties
never
cease
to
be
obligatory
except
in
cases
where
all
treaties
become
invalid
every
successor
to
the
sovereignty
in
virtue
of
whatever
title
he
may
succeed
is
obliged
to
observe
them
without
their
being
renewed
at
his
accession
wheaton
says
they
treaties
continue
to
bind
the
state
whatever
intervening
changes
may
take
place
in
its
internal
constitution
or
in
the
persons
of
its
rulers
the
state
continues
the
same
notwithstanding
such
change
and
consequently
the
treaty
relating
to
national
objects
remains
in
force
so
long
as
the
nation
exists
as
an
independent
state
there
is
no
disagreement
among
authorities
on
this
point
it
is
also
said
by
some
seeking
to
defend
or
palliate
the
united
states
government
continuous
violations
of
its
treaties
with
the
indians
that
the
practice
of
all
nations
has
been
and
is
to
abrogate
a
treaty
whenever
it
saw
good
reason
for
doing
so
this
is
true
but
the
treaties
have
been
done
away
with
in
one
of
two
ways
either
by
a
mutual
and
peaceful
agreement
to
that
effect
between
the
parties
who
had
made
treaty
being
considered
in
force
until
the
consent
of
both
parties
to
its
abrogation
had
been
by
a
distinct
avowal
on
the
part
of
one
nation
of
its
intention
no
longer
to
abide
by
it
and
to
take
therefore
its
chances
of
being
made
war
upon
in
consequence
neither
of
these
courses
has
been
pursued
by
the
united
states
government
in
its
with
the
indians
vattel
says
on
the
dissolution
of
treaties
treaties
may
be
dissolved
by
mutual
consent
at
the
of
the
contracting
powers
grotius
says
if
either
party
violate
the
league
the
other
party
is
freed
because
each
article
of
the
league
hath
the
form
and
virtue
of
a
condition
kent
says
the
violation
of
any
one
article
of
a
treaty
is
a
violation
of
the
whole
treaty
it
is
a
principle
of
universal
jurisprudence
that
a
compact
can
not
be
rescinded
by
one
party
only
if
the
other
party
does
not
consent
to
rescind
it
and
does
no
act
to
destroy
it
to
recommence
a
war
by
breach
of
the
articles
of
peace
is
deemed
much
more
odious
than
to
provoke
a
war
by
some
new
demand
or
aggression
for
the
latter
is
simply
injustice
but
in
the
former
case
the
party
is
guilty
both
of
perfidy
and
injustice
it
is
also
said
with
unanswerable
irrelevancy
by
some
who
seek
to
defend
or
palliate
the
united
states
government
continuous
violation
of
its
treaties
with
the
indians
that
it
was
in
the
first
place
absurd
to
make
treaties
with
them
at
all
to
consider
them
in
any
sense
as
powers
or
nations
the
logic
of
this
assertion
made
as
a
justification
for
the
breaking
of
several
hundred
treaties
concluded
at
different
times
during
the
last
hundred
years
and
broken
as
fast
as
concluded
seems
almost
equal
to
that
of
the
celebrated
defence
in
the
case
of
the
kettle
which
was
cracked
when
it
was
lent
whole
when
returned
and
in
fact
was
never
borrowed
at
all
it
would
be
a
waste
of
words
to
reason
with
minds
that
can
see
in
this
position
any
shelter
for
the
united
states
government
against
the
accusation
of
perfidy
in
its
treaty
relations
with
the
indians
the
statement
is
undoubtedly
a
true
one
that
the
indians
having
been
placed
in
the
anomalous
position
as
tribes
of
domestic
dependent
nations
and
as
individuals
in
the
still
more
anomalous
position
of
adult
wards
have
not
legally
possessed
the
power
our
right
to
put
them
or
to
consider
them
to
be
in
those
anomalous
positions
might
be
successfully
disputed
but
they
helpless
having
accepted
such
positions
did
no
doubt
thereby
lose
their
right
to
be
treated
with
as
nations
nevertheless
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
now
as
soon
as
our
government
was
established
it
proceeded
to
treat
with
them
as
nations
by
name
and
designation
and
with
precisely
the
same
forms
and
ratifications
that
it
used
in
treating
with
other
nations
and
it
continued
to
treat
with
them
as
nations
by
name
and
designation
and
with
continually
increasing
solemnity
of
asseveration
of
good
intent
and
good
faith
for
nearly
a
century
the
robbery
the
cruelty
which
were
done
under
the
cloak
of
this
hundred
years
of
and
are
greater
than
can
be
told
neither
mountains
nor
deserts
stayed
them
it
took
two
seas
to
set
their
bounds
in
congress
either
ashamed
of
making
treaties
only
to
break
them
or
grudging
the
time
money
and
paper
it
wasted
passed
an
act
to
the
effect
that
no
indian
tribe
should
hereafter
be
considered
as
a
foreign
nation
with
whom
the
united
states
might
contract
by
treaty
there
seems
to
have
been
at
the
time
in
the
minds
of
the
men
who
passed
this
act
a
certain
shadowy
sense
of
some
obligation
being
involved
in
treaties
for
they
added
to
the
act
a
proviso
that
it
should
not
be
construed
as
invalidating
any
treaties
already
made
but
this
sense
of
obligation
must
have
been
as
as
shadowy
and
could
have
had
no
element
of
shame
in
it
since
they
forthwith
proceeded
unabashed
to
negotiate
still
more
treaties
with
indians
and
break
them
for
instance
the
brunot
treaty
with
the
ute
indians
in
colorado
and
one
with
the
crow
indians
in
made
in
the
summer
of
they
were
called
at
the
time
conventions
or
agreements
and
not
treaties
but
the
difference
is
only
in
name
they
stated
in
a
succession
of
numbered
articles
promises
of
payment
of
moneys
and
surrenders
and
cessions
of
land
by
both
parties
were
to
be
ratified
by
congress
before
taking
effect
and
were
understood
by
the
indians
agreeing
to
them
to
be
as
binding
as
if
they
had
been
called
treaties
the
fact
that
no
man
sense
of
justice
openly
revolted
against
such
subterfuges
under
the
name
of
agreements
is
only
to
be
explained
by
the
deterioration
of
the
sense
of
honor
in
the
nation
in
the
days
of
grotius
there
were
men
who
failed
to
see
dishonor
in
a
trick
if
profit
came
of
it
and
of
such
he
wrote
in
words
whose
truth
might
sting
as
no
doubt
it
stung
then
whereas
there
are
many
that
think
it
superfluous
to
require
that
justice
from
a
free
people
or
their
governors
which
they
exact
daily
from
private
men
the
ground
of
this
error
is
this
because
these
men
respect
nothing
in
the
law
but
the
profit
that
ariseth
from
it
which
in
private
persons
being
single
and
unable
to
defend
themselves
is
plain
and
evident
but
for
great
cities
that
seem
to
have
within
themselves
all
things
necessary
for
their
own
it
doth
not
so
plainly
appear
that
they
have
any
need
of
that
virtue
called
justice
which
respects
strangers
these
extracts
from
unquestioned
authorities
on
international
law
prove
that
we
may
hold
nations
to
standards
of
justice
and
good
faith
as
we
hold
men
that
the
standards
are
the
same
in
each
case
and
that
a
nation
that
steals
and
lies
and
breaks
promises
will
no
more
be
respected
or
unpunished
than
a
man
who
steals
and
lies
and
breaks
promises
it
is
possible
to
go
still
farther
than
this
and
to
show
that
a
nation
habitually
guilty
of
such
conduct
might
properly
be
dealt
with
therefore
by
other
nations
by
nations
in
no
wise
suffering
on
account
of
her
bad
faith
except
as
all
nations
suffer
when
the
interests
of
human
society
are
injured
the
interest
of
human
society
says
vattel
would
authorize
all
the
other
nations
to
form
a
confederacy
in
order
to
humble
and
chastise
the
delinquent
when
a
nation
regards
no
right
as
sacred
the
safety
of
the
human
race
requires
that
she
should
be
repressed
to
form
and
support
an
unjust
pretension
is
not
only
doing
an
injury
to
the
party
whose
interests
are
affected
by
that
pretension
but
to
despise
justice
in
general
is
doing
an
injury
to
all
nations
the
history
of
the
united
states
government
repeated
violations
of
faith
with
the
indians
thus
convicts
us
as
a
nation
not
only
of
having
outraged
the
principles
of
justice
which
are
the
basis
of
international
law
and
of
having
laid
ourselves
open
to
the
accusation
of
both
cruelty
and
perfidy
but
of
having
made
ourselves
liable
to
all
punishments
which
follow
upon
such
arbitrary
punishment
at
the
hands
of
any
civilized
nation
who
might
see
fit
to
call
us
to
account
and
to
that
more
certain
natural
punishment
which
sooner
or
later
as
surely
comes
from
as
harvests
come
from
sown
seed
to
prove
all
this
it
is
only
necessary
to
study
the
history
of
any
one
of
the
indian
tribes
i
propose
to
give
in
the
following
chapters
merely
outline
sketches
of
the
history
of
a
few
of
them
not
entering
more
into
details
than
is
necessary
to
show
the
repeated
broken
faith
of
the
united
states
government
toward
them
a
full
history
of
the
wrongs
they
have
suffered
at
the
hands
of
the
authorities
military
and
civil
and
also
of
the
citizens
of
this
country
it
would
take
years
to
write
and
volumes
to
hold
there
is
but
one
hope
of
righting
this
wrong
it
lies
in
appeal
to
the
heart
and
the
conscience
of
the
american
people
what
the
people
demand
congress
will
do
it
has
our
shame
be
it
the
demand
of
part
of
the
people
that
all
these
wrongs
have
been
committed
these
treaties
broken
these
robberies
done
by
the
government
so
long
as
there
remains
on
our
frontier
one
square
mile
of
land
occupied
by
a
weak
and
helpless
owner
there
will
be
a
strong
and
unscrupulous
frontiersman
ready
to
seize
it
and
a
weak
and
unscrupulous
politician
who
can
be
hired
for
a
vote
or
for
money
to
back
him
the
only
thing
that
can
stay
this
is
a
mighty
outspoken
sentiment
and
purpose
of
the
great
body
of
the
people
right
sentiment
and
right
purpose
in
a
senator
here
and
there
and
a
representative
here
and
there
are
little
more
than
straws
which
make
momentary
eddies
but
do
not
obstruct
the
tide
the
precedents
of
a
century
unhindered
and
profitable
robbery
have
mounted
up
into
a
very
gibraltar
of
defence
and
shelter
to
those
who
care
for
nothing
but
safety
and
gain
that
such
precedents
should
be
held
and
openly
avowed
as
standards
is
only
one
more
infamy
added
to
the
list
were
such
logic
employed
in
the
case
of
an
individual
man
how
quick
would
all
men
see
its
enormity
suppose
that
a
man
had
had
the
misfortune
to
be
born
into
a
family
whose
name
had
been
blackened
by
generations
of
criminals
that
his
father
his
grandfather
and
his
before
them
had
lived
in
prisons
and
died
on
scaffolds
should
that
man
say
in
his
soul
go
to
what
is
the
use
i
also
will
commit
robbery
and
murder
and
get
the
same
gain
by
it
which
my
family
must
have
done
or
shall
he
say
in
his
soul
god
help
me
i
will
do
what
may
be
within
the
power
of
one
man
and
the
compass
of
one
generation
to
atone
for
the
wickedness
and
to
make
clean
the
name
of
my
dishonored
house
what
an
opportunity
for
the
congress
of
to
cover
itself
with
a
lustre
of
glory
as
the
first
to
cut
short
our
nation
record
of
cruelties
and
perjuries
the
first
to
attempt
to
redeem
the
name
of
the
united
states
from
the
stain
of
a
century
of
dishonor
chapter
ii
the
delawares
when
hendrik
hudson
anchored
his
ship
the
off
new
york
island
in
the
delawares
stood
in
great
numbers
on
the
shore
to
receive
him
exclaiming
in
their
innocence
behold
the
gods
have
come
to
visit
us
more
than
a
hundred
years
later
the
traditions
of
this
event
were
still
current
in
the
tribe
the
aged
moravian
missionary
heckewelder
writing
in
says
i
at
one
time
in
april
was
astonished
when
i
heard
one
of
their
orators
a
great
chief
of
the
delawares
by
name
go
over
this
ground
recapitulating
the
most
extraordinary
events
which
had
before
happened
and
concluding
in
these
words
admit
that
there
are
good
white
men
but
they
bear
no
proportion
to
the
bad
the
bad
must
be
the
strongest
for
they
rule
they
do
what
they
please
they
enslave
those
who
are
not
of
their
color
although
created
by
the
same
great
spirit
who
created
them
they
would
make
slaves
of
us
if
they
could
but
as
they
can
not
do
it
they
kill
us
there
is
no
faith
to
be
placed
in
their
words
they
are
not
like
the
indians
who
are
only
enemies
while
at
war
and
are
friends
in
peace
they
will
say
to
an
indian
my
friend
my
brother
they
will
take
him
by
the
hand
and
at
the
same
moment
destroy
him
and
so
you
he
was
addressing
himself
to
the
christian
indians
at
gnadenhütten
pennsylvania
also
be
treated
by
them
before
long
remember
that
this
day
i
have
warned
you
to
beware
of
such
friends
as
these
i
know
the
they
are
not
to
be
trusted
the
original
name
of
the
delawares
was
lenni
lenape
or
original
people
they
were
also
called
by
the
western
tribes
wapenachki
people
at
the
rising
of
the
sun
when
the
name
delawares
was
given
to
them
by
the
whites
they
at
first
resented
it
but
being
told
that
they
and
also
one
of
their
rivers
were
thus
named
after
a
great
english
de
la
were
much
pleased
and
willingly
took
the
name
their
lands
stretched
from
the
hudson
river
to
the
potomac
they
were
a
but
gentle
people
much
under
the
control
of
the
arrogant
and
iroquois
who
had
put
upon
them
the
degradation
of
being
called
women
and
being
forced
to
make
war
or
give
up
land
at
the
pleasure
of
their
masters
during
william
penn
humane
administration
of
the
affairs
of
pennsylvania
the
delawares
were
his
most
devoted
friends
they
called
him
mignon
or
elder
brother
from
his
first
arrival
in
their
country
says
heckewelder
a
friendship
was
formed
between
them
which
was
to
last
as
long
as
the
sun
should
shine
and
the
rivers
flow
with
water
that
friendship
would
undoubtedly
have
continued
to
the
end
of
time
had
their
good
brother
always
remained
among
them
in
the
french
and
indian
war
of
many
of
them
fought
on
the
side
of
the
french
against
the
english
and
in
the
beginning
of
our
revolutionary
war
the
majority
of
them
sided
with
the
english
against
us
most
of
the
memorable
indian
massacres
which
happened
during
this
period
were
the
result
of
either
french
or
english
influence
neither
nation
was
enough
to
scorn
availing
herself
of
savage
allies
to
do
bloody
work
which
she
would
not
have
dared
to
risk
national
reputation
by
doing
herself
this
fact
is
too
much
overlooked
in
the
habitual
estimates
of
the
barbarous
ferocity
of
the
indian
character
as
shown
by
those
early
massacres

x
the
united

first
treaty
with

delawares
was
made
in
at
fort
pitt
the
parties
to
it
were
said
to
be
the
united
states
and
the
delaware
nation
it
stipulates
that
there
shall
be
peace
and
that
the
troops
of
the
united
states
may
pass
through
the
country
of
the
delaware
nation
upon
paying
the
full
value
of
any
supplies
they
may
use
it
further
says
that
whereas
the
enemies
of
the
united
states
have
endeavored
by
every
artifice
to
possess
the
indians
with
an
opinion
that
it
is
our
design
to
extirpate
them
and
take
possession
of
their
country
to
obviate
such
false
suggestions
the
united
states
guarantee
to
said
nation
of
delawares
and
their
heirs
all
their
territorial
rights
in
the
fullest
and
most
ample
manner
as
bounded
by
former
treaties
the
treaty
also
provides
that
should
it
for
the
future
be
found
conducive
for
the
mutual
interest
of
both
parties
to
invite
any
other
tribes
who
have
been
friends
to
the
interests
of
the
united
states
to
join
the
present
confederation
and
form
a
state
whereof
the
delaware
nation
shall
be
the
head
it
shall
be
done
and
the
delawares
shall
be
entitled
to
send
a
representative
to
congress
footnote
it
is
superfluous
to
say
that
these
provisions
were
never
carried
out
the
delawares
agreed
to
send
all
the
warriors
they
could
spare
to
fight
for
us
and
that
there
should
be
peace
and
perpetual
friendship
at
this
time
the
rest
of
the
ohio
tribes
most
of
the
new
york
tribes
and
a
large
part
of
the
delawares
were
in
arms
on
the
british
side
when
the
war
of
the
revolution
was
concluded
they
were
all
forced
to
make
peace
as
best
they
could
with
us
and
in
our
first
treaty
we
provided
for
the
reinstating
in
the
delaware
nation
of
the
chiefs
and
headmen
who
had
made
that
old
alliance
with
us
they
having
lost
caste
in
their
tribe
for
having
fought
on
our
side
it
is
agreed
says
the
final
article
of
the
treaty
that
the
delaware
chiefs
kelelamand
or
henry
henque
pushees
or
the
big
cat
and
wicocalind
or
captain
white
eyes
who
took
up
the
hatchet
for
the
united
states
and
their
families
shall
be
received
into
the
delaware
nation
in
the
same
situation
and
rank
as
before
the
war
and
enjoy
their
due
portions
of
the
lands
given
to
the
wyandotte
and
delaware
nations
in
this
treaty
as
fully
as
if
they
had
not
taken
part
with
america
or
as
any
other
person
or
persons
in
the
said
nations
this
captain
white
eyes
had
adhered
to
our
cause
in
spite
of
great
opposition
from
the
hostile
part
of
the
tribe
at
one
time
he
was
threatened
with
a
violent
death
if
he
should
dare
to
say
one
word
for
the
american
cause
but
by
spirited
harangues
he
succeeded
in
keeping
the
enthusiasm
of
his
own
party
centred
around
himself
and
finally
carrying
them
over
to
the
side
of
the
united
states
some
of
his
speeches
are
on
record
and
are
worthy
to
be
remembered
if
you
will
go
out
in
this
war
he
said
to
them
at
one
time
when
the
band
were
inclined
to
join
the
british
you
shall
not
go
without
me
i
have
taken
peace
measures
it
is
true
with
the
view
of
saving
my
tribe
from
destruction
but
if
you
think
me
in
the
wrong
if
you
give
more
credit
to
runaway
vagabonds
than
to
your
own
a
man
to
a
warrior
to
a
you
insist
on
fighting
the
and
i
will
go
with
you
and
i
will
not
go
like
the
who
sets
his
dogs
on
the
animal
to
be
beaten
about
with
his
paws
while
he
keeps
himself
at
a
safe
distance
no
i
will
lead
you
on
i
will
place
myself
in
the
front
i
will
fall
with
the
first
of
you
you
can
do
as
you
choose
but
as
for
me
i
will
not
survive
my
nation
i
will
not
live
to
bewail
the
miserable
destruction
of
a
brave
people
who
deserved
as
you
do
a
better
fate
were
there
many
speeches
made
by
commanders
to
their
troops
in
those
revolutionary
days
with
which

treaties
which
have
been
ordered
or
which
may
be
ordered
to
be
held
in
the
present
year
with
the
several
indian
tribes
in
the
northern
department
and
for
extinguishing
the
indian
claims
the
whole
of
the
said
together
with
of
the
said
to
be
applied
solely
to
the
purpose
of
extinguishing
indian
claims
to
the
lands
they
have
already
ceded
to
the
united
states
by
obtaining
regular
conveyances
for
the
same
and
for
extending
a
purchase
beyond
the
limits
hitherto
fixed
by
treaty
here
is
one
of
the
earliest
records
of
the
principle
and
method
on
which
the
united
states
government
first
began
its
dealings
with
indians
regular
conveyances
extinguishing
claims
by
extending
purchase
these
are
all
the
strictest
of
legal
terms
and
admit
of
no
double
interpretations
the
indians
had
been
much
dissatisfied
ever
since
the
first
treaties
were
made
they
claimed
that
they
had
been
made
by
a
few
only
representing
a
part
of
the
tribe
and
in
they
had
held
a
great
council
on
the
banks
of
the
detroit
river
and
sent
a
message
to
congress
of
which
the
following
extracts
will
show
the
spirit
they
said
it
is
now
more
than
three
years
since
peace
was
made
between
the
king
of
great
britain
and
you
but
we
the
indians
were
disappointed
finding
ourselves
not
included
in
that
peace
according
to
our
expectations
for
we
thought
that
its
conclusion
would
have
promoted
a
friendship
between
the
united
states
and
the
indians
and
that
we
might
enjoy
that
happiness
that
formerly
subsisted
between
us
and
our
elder
brethren
we
have
received
two
very
agreeable
messages
from
the
thirteen
united
states
we
also
received
a
message
from
the
king
whose
war
we
were
engaged
in
desiring
us
to
remain
quiet
which
we
accordingly
complied
with
during
this
time
of
tranquillity
we
were
deliberating
the
best
method
we
could
to
form
a
lasting
reconciliation
with
the
thirteen
united
states
we
are
still
of
the
same
opinion
as
to
the
means
which
may
tend
to
reconcile
us
to
each
other
and
we
are
sorry
to
find
although
we
had
the
best
thoughts
in
our
minds
during
the
period
mischief
has
nevertheless
happened
between
you
and
us
we
are
still
anxious
of
putting
our
plan
of
accommodation
into
execution
and
we
shall
briefly
inform
you
of
the
means
that
seem
most
probable
to
us
of
effecting
a
firm
and
lasting
peace
and
reconciliation
the
first
step
toward
which
should
in
our
opinion
be
that
all
treaties
carried
on
with
the
united
states
on
our
parts
should
be
with
the
general
will
of
the
whole
confederacy
and
carried
on
in
the
most
open
manner
without
any
restraint
on
either
side
and
especially
as
landed
matters
are
often
the
subject
of
our
councils
with
matter
of
the
greatest
importance
and
of
general
concern
to
this
case
we
hold
it
indisputably
necessary
that
any
cession
of
our
lands
should
be
made
in
the
most
public
manner
and
by
the
united
voice
of
the
confederacy
holding
all
partial
treaties
as
void
and
of
no
effect
we
say
let
us
meet
and
let
us
pursue
such
steps
as
become
upright
and
honest
men
we
beg
that
you
will
prevent
your
surveyors
and
other
people
from
coming
upon
our
side
of
the
ohio
river
these
are
touching
words
when
we
remember
that
only
the
year
before
the
united
states
had
expressly
told
these
indians
that
if
any
white
citizens
attempted
to
settle
on
their
lands
they
might
punish
them
as
they
pleased
we
have
told
you
before
we
wished
to
pursue
just
steps
and
we
are
determined
they
shall
appear
just
and
reasonable
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
this
is
the
determination
of
all
the
chiefs
of
our
confederacy
now
assembled
here
notwithstanding
the
accidents
that
have
happened
in
our
villages
even
when
in
council
where
several
innocent
chiefs
were
killed
when
absolutely
engaged
in
promoting
a
peace
with
you
the
thirteen
united
states
the
next
year
the
president
instructed
the
governor
of
the
territory
northwest
of
the
ohio
to
examine
carefully
into
the
real
temper
of
the
indian
tribes
in
his
department
and
says
the
treaties
which
have
been
made
may
be
examined
but
must
not
be
departed
from
unless
a
change
of
boundary
beneficial
to
the
united
states
can
be
obtained
he
says
also
you
will
not
neglect
any
opportunity
that
may
offer
of
extinguishing
the
indian
rights
to
the
westward
far
as
the
beyond
that
river
even
the
wildest
dream
of
greed
did
not
at
that
time
look
the
president
adds
moreover
you
may
stipulate
that
any
white
persons
going
over
the
said
boundaries
without
a
license
from
the
proper
officers
of
the
united
states
may
be
treated
in
such
manner
as
the
indians
may
see
fit
i
have
not
yet
seen
in
any
accounts
of
the
indian
hostilities
on
the
frontier
during
this
period
any
reference
to
those
repeated
permissions
given
by
the
united
states
to
the
indians
to
defend
their
lands
as
they
saw
fit
probably
the
greater
number
of
the
pioneer
settlers
were
as
ignorant
of
these
provisions
in
indian
treaties
as
are
the
greater
number
of
american
citizens
who
are
honestly
being
unaware
are
therefore
the
indians
had
either
provocation
or
right
to
kill
intruders
on
their
lands
at
this
time
separate
treaties
were
made
with
the
six
nations
and
the
governor
says
that
these
treaties
were
made
separately
because
of
the
jealousy
and
hostility
existing
between
them
and
the
delawares
wyandottes
which
he
is
not
willing
to
lessen
because
it
weakens
their
power
indeed
he
frankly
adds
it
would
not
be
very
difficult
if
circumstances
required
it
to
set
them
at
deadly
variance
thus
early
in
our
history
was
the
ingenious
plan
evolved
of
first
maddening
the
indians
into
war
and
then
falling
upon
them
with
exterminating
punishment
the
gentleman
who
has
left
on
the
official
records
of
his
country
his
claim
to
the
first
suggestion
and
recommendation
of
this
method
is
arthur
clair
governor
of
the
territory
of
the
united
states
northwest
of
the
ohio
river
and
commissioner
plenipotentiary
of
the
united
states
of
america
for
removing
all
causes
of
controversy
regulating
trade
and
settling
boundaries
with
the
indian
nations
in
the
northern
department
under
all
these
conditions
it
is
not
a
matter
of
wonder
that
the
frontier
was
a
scene
of
perpetual
devastation
and
bloodshed
and
that
year
by
year
there
grew
stronger
in
the
minds
of
the
whites
a
terror
and
hatred
of
indians
and
in
the
minds
of
the
indians
a
stronger
and
stronger
distrust
and
hatred
of
the
whites
the
delawares
were
through
the
earlier
part
of
these
troubled
times
friendly
in
we
find
the
secretary
of
war
recommending
the
commissioners
sent
to
treat
with
the
hostile
miamis
and
wabash
indians
to
stop
by
the
way
with
the
friendly
delawares
and
take
some
of
their
leading
chiefs
with
them
as
allies
he
says
these
tribes
are
our
friends
and
as
far
as
is
known
the
treaties
have
been
well
observed
by
them
but
in
we
find
them
mentioned
among
the
hostile
tribes
to
whom
was
sent
a
message
from
the
united
states
government
containing
the
following
extraordinary
paragraphs
brethren
the
president
of
the
united
states
entertains
the
opinion
that
the
war
which
exists
is
an
error
and
mistake
on
your
parts
that
you
believe
the
united
states
want
to
deprive
you
of
your
lands
and
drive
you
out
of
the
country
assured
that
this
is
not
on
the
contrary
that
we
should
be
greatly
gratified
with
the
opportunity
of
imparting
to
you
all
the
blessings
of
civilized
life
of
teaching
you
to
cultivate
the
earth
and
raise
corn
to
raise
oxen
sheep
and
other
domestic
animals
to
build
comfortable
houses
and
to
educate
your
children
so
as
ever
to
dwell
upon
the
land
consult
therefore
upon
the
great
object
of
peace
call
in
your
parties
and
enjoin
a
cessation
of
all
further
depredations
and
as
many
of
the
principal
chiefs
as
shall
choose
repair
to
philadelphia
the
seat
of
the
great
government
and
there
make
a
peace
founded
on
the
principles
of
justice
and
humanity
that
no
additional
lands
will
be
required
of
you
or
any
other
tribe
to
those
that
have
been
ceded
by
former
it
was
in
this
same
year
also
that
general
putnam
said
to
them
in
a
speech
at
post
vincennes
the
united
states
do
mean
to
wrong
you
out
of
your
lands
they
do
want
to
take
away
your
lands
by
force
they
want
to
do
you
justice
and
the
venerable
missionary
heckewelder
who
had
journeyed
all
the
way
from
bethlehem
pennsylvania
to
try
to
help
bring
about
peace
said
to
them
the
great
chief
who
has
spoken
to
you
is
a
good
man
he
loves
you
and
will
always
speak
the
truth
to
you
i
wish
you
to
listen
to
his
words
and
do
as
he
desires
you
in
a
great
council
was
held
to
which
came
the
chiefs
and
headmen
of
the
delawares
and
of
twelve
other
tribes
to
meet
commissioners
of
the
united
states
for
one
last
effort
to
settle
the
vexed
boundary
question
the
records
of
this
council
are
profoundly
touching
the
indians
reiterated
over
and
over
the
provisions
of
the
old
treaties
which
had
established
the
ohio
river
as
one
of
their
boundaries
their
words
were
not
the
words
of
ignorant
barbarians
clumsily
and
doggedly
holding
to
a
point
they
were
the
words
of
rulers
insisting
on
the
rights
of
their
nations
as
the
days
went
on
and
it
became
more
and
more
clear
that
the
united
states
commissioners
would
not
agree
to
the
establishment
of
the
boundary
for
which
the
indians
contended
the
speeches
of
the
chiefs
grow
sadder
and
sadder
finally
in
desperation
as
a
last
hope
they
propose
to
the
commissioners
that
all
the
money
which
the
united
states
offers
to
pay
to
them
for
their
lands
shall
be
given
to
the
white
settlers
to
induce
them
to
move
away
they
say
money
to
us
is
of
no
value
and
to
most
of
us
unknown
and
as
no
consideration
whatever
can
induce
us
to
sell
the
lands
on
which
we
get
sustenance
for
our
women
and
children
we
hope
we
may
be
allowed
to
point
out
a
mode
by
which
your
settlers
may
be
easily
removed
and
peace
thereby
obtained
we
know
that
these
settlers
are
poor
or
they
would
never
have
ventured
to
live
in
a
country
which
has
been
in
continual
trouble
ever
since
they
crossed
the
ohio
divide
therefore
this
large
sum
of
money
which
you
have
offered
us
among
these
people
give
to
each
also
a
proportion
of
what
you
say
you
would
give
to
us
annually
over
and
above
this
very
large
sum
of
money
and
we
are
persuaded
they
would
most
readily
accept
of
it
in
lieu
of
the
lands
you
sold
them
if
you
add
also
the
great
sums
you
must
expend
in
raising
and
paying
armies
with
a
view
to
force
us
to
yield
you
our
country
you
will
certainly
have
more
than
sufficient
for
the
purpose
of
repaying
these
settlers
for
all
their
labor
and
their
improvements
you
have
talked
to
us
about
concessions
it
appears
strange
that
you
should
expect
any
from
us
who
have
only
been
defending
our
just
rights
against
your
invasions
we
want
peace
restore
to
us
our
country
and
we
shall
be
enemies
no
longer
we
desire
you
to
consider
brothers
that
our
only
demand
is
the
peaceable
possession
of
a
small
part
of
our
once
great
country
look
back
and
review
the
lands
from
whence
we
have
been
driven
to
this
spot
we
can
retreat
no
farther
because
the
country
behind
hardly
affords
food
for
its
present
inhabitants
and
we
have
therefore
resolved
to
leave
our
bones
in
this
small
space
to
which
we
are
now
confined
the
commissioners
replied
that
to
make
the
ohio
river
the
boundary
was
now
impossible
that
they
sincerely
regretted
that
peace
could
not
be
made
but
knowing
the
upright
and
liberal
views
of
the
united
states
they
trust
that
impartial
judges
will
not
attribute
the
continuance
of
the
war
to
them
notice
was
sent
to
the
governor
that
the
indians
refused
to
make
peace
and
general
anthony
wayne
a
few
weeks
later
wrote
to
the
secretary
of
war
the
safety
of
the
western
frontiers
the
reputation
of
the
legion
the
dignity
and
interest
of
the
forbid
a
retrograde
manœuvre
or
giving
up
one
inch
of
ground
we
now
possess
till
the
enemy
are
compelled
to
sue
for
peace
the
history
of
the
campaigns
that
followed
is
to
be
found
in
many
volumes
treating
of
the
pioneer
life
of
ohio
and
other
states
one
letter
of
general
wayne
to
the
secretary
of
war
in
august
contains
a
paragraph
which
is
interesting
as
showing
the
habits
and
method
of
life
of
the
people
whom
we
at
this
time
by
force
of
arms
drove
out
from
their
which
we
had
only
a
few
years
before
solemnly
guaranteed
to
them
even
giving
them
permission
to
punish
any
white
intruders
there
as
they
saw
fit
by
a
feint
of
approaching
grand
glaize
through
the
miami
villages
general
wayne
surprised
the
settlement
and
the
indians
being
warned
by
a
deserter
had
barely
time
to
flee
for
their
lives
what
general
wayne
had
intended
to
do
may
be
inferred
from
this
sentence
in
his
letter
i
have
good
grounds
to
conclude
that
the
defection
of
this
villain
prevented
the
enemy
from
receiving
a
fatal
blow
at
this
place
when
least
expected
however
he
consoles
himself
by
the
fact
that
he
has
gained
possession
of
the
grand
emporium
of
the
hostile
indians
of
the
west
without
loss
of
blood
the
very
extensive
and
highly
cultivated
fields
and
gardens
show
the
work
of
many
hands
the
margins
of
those
beautiful
miamis
of
the
lake
and
au
like
one
continued
village
for
a
number
of
miles
both
above
and
below
this
place
nor
have
i
ever
before
beheld
such
immense
fields
of
corn
in
any
part
of
america
from
canada
to
florida
all
these
villages
were
burnt
and
all
these
cornfields
destroyed
the
indians
were
followed
up
and
defeated
in
a
sharp
fight
the
british
agents
did
their
best
to
keep
them
hostile
and
no
inconsiderable
aid
was
furnished
to
them
from
canada
but
after
a
winter
of
suffering
and
hunger
and
great
vacillations
of
purpose
they
finally
decided
to
yield
to
the
inevitable
and
in
the
summer
of
they
are
to
be
found
once
more
assembled
in
council
for
the
purpose
of
making
a
treaty
once
more
to
be
told
by
the
representatives
of
the
united
states
government
that
the
heart
of
general
washington
the
great
chief
of
america
wishes
for
nothing
so
much
as
peace
and
brotherly
love
that
such
is
the
justice
and
liberality
of
the
united
states
that
they
will
now
a
third
time
pay
for
lands
and
that
they
are
acting
the
part
of
a
tender
father
to
them
and
their
children
in
thus
providing
for
them
not
only
at
present
but
forever
eleven
hundred
and
thirty
indians
eleven
tribes
besides
the
delawares
being
represented
were
parties
to
this
treaty
by
this
treaty
nearly
of
the
present
state
of
ohio
were
ceded
to
the
united
states
and
in
consideration
of
these
cessions
and
relinquishments
and
to
manifest
the
liberality
of
the
united
states
as
the
great
means
of
rendering
this
peace
strong
and
perpetual
the
united
states
relinquished
all
claims
to
all
other
indian
lands
northward
of
the
river
ohio
eastward
of
the
mississippi
and
westward
and
southward
of
the
great
lakes
and
the
waters
uniting
them
according
to
the
boundary
line
agreed
upon
by
the
united
states
and
the
king
of
great
britain
in
the
treaty
of
peace
made
between
them
in
the
year
with
the
exception
of
four
tracts
of
land
but
it
was
stated
to
the
indians
that
these
reservations
were
not
made
to
annoy
or
impose
the
smallest
degree
of
restraint
on
them
in
the
quiet
enjoyment
and
full
possession
of
their
lands
but
simply
to
connect
the
settlements
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
and
to
prove
convenient
and
advantageous
to
the
different
tribes
of
indians
residing
and
hunting
in
their
vicinity
the
fifth
article
of
the
treaty
is
to
prevent
any
misunderstanding
about
the
indian
lands
now
relinquished
by
the
united
states
it
is
explicitly
declared
that
the
meaning
of
that
relinquishment
is
this
that
the
indian
tribes
who
have
a
right
to
those
lands
are
quietly
to
enjoy
planting
and
dwelling
thereon
long
as
they
without
any
molestation
from
the
united
states
but
when
those
tribes
or
any
of
them
shall
be
disposed
to
sell
their
lands
or
any
part
of
them
they
are
to
be
sold
only
to
the
united
states
and
until
such
sale
the
united
states
will
protect
all
the
said
indian
tribes
in
the
quiet
enjoyment
of
their
lands
against
all
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
against
all
other
white
persons
who
intrude
on
the
same
the
sixth
article
reiterates
the
old
pledge
proved
by
the
last
three
years
to
be
so
if
any
citizen
of
the
united
states
or
any
other
white
person
or
persons
shall
presume
to
settle
upon
the
lands
now
relinquished
by
the
united
states
such
citizen
or
other
person
shall
be
out
of
the
protection
of
the
united
states
and
the
indian
tribe
on
whose
land
the
settlement
may
be
made
may
drive
off
the
settler
or
punish
him
in
such
manner
as
they
shall
think
fit
the
seventh
article
gives
the
indians
the
liberty
to
hunt
within
the
territory
and
lands
which
they
have
now
ceded
to
the
united
states
without
hinderance
or
molestation
so
long
as
they
demean
themselves
peaceably
the
united
states
agreed
to
pay
to
the
indians
twenty
thousand
worth
of
goods
at
once
and
henceforward
every
year
forever
useful
goods
to
the
value
of
nine
thousand
five
hundred
dollars
peace
was
declared
to
be
established
and
perpetual
general
wayne
told
the
indians
that
they
might
believe
him
for
he
had
never
in
a
public
capacity
told
a
lie
and
one
of
the
indians
said
with
much
more
dignity
the
great
spirit
above
hears
us
and
i
trust
we
shall
not
endeavor
to
deceive
each
other
in
by
a
treaty
at
vincennes
the
bounds
of
the
reservation
of
the
post
of
vincennes
were
defined
and
the
indians
as
a
mark
of
their
regard
and
attachment
to
the
united
states
relinquished
to
the
united
states
the
great
salt
spring
on
the
saline
creek
in
less
than
a
year
we
made
still
another
treaty
with
them
for
the
extinguishment
of
their
title
to
a
tract
of
land
between
the
ohio
and
the
wabash
rivers
which
they
sold
to
us
for
a
ten
years
annuity
of
three
hundred
dollars
which
was
to
be
exclusively
appropriated
to
ameliorating
their
condition
and
promoting
their
civilization
and
in
one
year
more
still
another
treaty
in
which
a
still
further
cession
of
land
was
made
for
a
permanent
annuity
of
one
thousand
dollars
in
august
of
this
year
general
harrison
writes
to
the
secretary
of
war
that
there
are
great
dissensions
between
the
delawares
and
miamis
in
regard
to
some
of
the
ceded
lands
the
miamis
claiming
that
they
had
never
consented
to
give
them
up
general
harrison
observes
the
most
exact
neutrality
in
this
matter
but
says
a
knowledge
of
the
value
of
land
is
fast
gaining
ground
among
the
indians
and
negotiations
are
becoming
in
consequence
much
more
difficult
in
the
course
of
this
controversy
one
of
the
chiefs
has
said
that
he
knew
a
great
part
of
the
land
was
worth
six
dollars
an
acre
it
is
only
ten
years
since
one
of
the
chiefs
of
these
same
tribes
had
said
money
is
to
us
of
no
value
however
they
must
be
yet
very
far
from
having
reached
any
true
estimate
of
real
values
as
general
harrison
adds
from
the
best
calculation
i
have
been
able
to
make
the
tract
now
ceded
contains
at
least
two
millions
of
acres
and
embraces
some
of
the
finest
lands
in
the
western
country
cheap
at
one
thousand
dollars
a
year
with
the
negro
man
thrown
in
which
general
harrison
tells
the
secretary
he
has
ordered
captain
wells
to
purchase
and
present
to
the
chief
the
turtle
and
to
draw
on
the
united
states
treasury
for
the
amount
paid
for
him
four
years
later
general
harrison
is
instructed
by
the
president
to
take
advantage
of
the
most
favorable
moment
for
extinguishing
the
indian
title
to
the
lands
lying
east
of
the
wabash
and
adjoining
south
and
the
title
was
extinguished
by
the
treaty
of
fort
little
more
money
paid
and
a
great
deal
of
land
given
up
in
we
made
a
treaty
simply
of
peace
and
friendship
with
the
delawares
and
several
other
tribes
they
agreeing
to
fight
faithfully
on
our
side
against
the
english
and
we
agreeing
to
confirm
and
establish
all
the
boundaries
as
they
had
existed
before
the
war
in
it
was
deemed
advisable
to
make
an
effort
to
extinguish
the
indian
title
to
all
the
lands
claimed
by
them
within
the
limits
of
the
state
of
ohio
two
commissioners
were
appointed
with
great
discretionary
powers
and
a
treaty
was
concluded
early
in
the
autumn
by
which
there
was
ceded
to
the
united
states
nearly
all
the
land
to
which
the
indians
had
claim
in
ohio
a
part
of
indiana
and
a
part
of
michigan
this
treaty
was
said
by
the
secretary
of
war
to
be
the
most
important
of
any
hitherto
made
with
the
indians
the
extent
of
the
cession
far
exceeded
his
most
sanguine
expectations
and
he
had
the
honesty
to
admit
that
there
can
be
no
real
or
objection
to
the
amount
of
the
compensation
given
for
it
except
that
it
is
not
an
adequate
one
the
commissioners
who
negotiated
the
treaty
were
apprehensive
that
they
would
be
accused
of
having
made
too
liberal
terms
with
the
indians
and
in
their
report
to
the
department
they
enumerate
apologetically
the
reasons
which
made
it
impossible
for
them
to
get
the
land
cheaper
cass
says
of
the
terms
under
any
circumstances
they
will
fall
infinitely
short
of
the
pecuniary
and
political
value
of
the
country
obtained
the
indians
parties
to
this
treaty
surrendered
by
it
almost
the
last
of
their
and
would
soon
be
driven
to
depending
wholly
upon
the
cultivation
of
the
soil
in
the
delawares
again
ceded
land
to
the
united
all
to
which
they
laid
claim
in
the
state
of
the
united
states
promised
to
provide
for
them
a
country
to
reside
in
on
the
west
side
of
the
mississippi
and
to
guarantee
to
them
the
peaceable
possession
of
the
same
they
were
to
have
four
thousand
dollars
a
year
in
addition
to
all
the
sums
promised
by
previous
treaties
and
they
were
to
be
allowed
to
remain
three
years
longer
by
sufferance
in
their
present
homes
the
government
also
agreed
to
pay
them
for
their
improvements
on
their
lands
to
give
them
a
hundred
and
twenty
horses
and
a
sufficient
number
of
pirogues
to
aid
in
transporting
them
to
the
west
side
of
the
mississippi
also
provisions
for
the
journey
in
a
supplementary
article
was
added
to
this
treaty
the
united
states
government
began
to
show
traces
of
compunction
and
pity
the
article
says
whereas
the
delaware
nation
are
now
willing
to
remove
it
is
agreed
upon
that
the
country
in
the
fork
of
the
kansas
and
missouri
rivers
selected
for
their
home
shall
be
conveyed
and
forever
secured
by
the
united
states
to
the
said
delaware
nation
as
their
permanent
residence
and
the
united
states
hereby
pledges
the
faith
of
the
government
to
guarantee
to
the
said
delaware
nation
forever
the
quiet
and
peaceable
and
undisturbed
enjoyment
of
the
same
against
the
claims
and
assaults
of
all
and
every
other
people
whatever
an
additional
permanent
annuity
of
one
thousand
dollars
is
promised
forty
horses
and
the
use
of
six
wagons
and
to
assist
in
removing
heavy
articles
provisions
for
the
journey
and
one
subsistence
after
they
reach
their
new
home
also
the
erection
of
a
grist
and
saw
mill
within
two
years
in
the
secretary
of
war
congratulated
the
country
on
the
fact
that
the
country
north
of
the
ohio
east
of
the
mississippi
including
the
states
of
ohio
indiana
illinois
and
the
territory
of
michigan
as
far
as
the
fox
and
wisconsin
rivers
has
been
practically
cleared
of
the
embarrassments
of
indian
relations
as
there
are
not
more
than
five
thousand
indians
all
told
left
in
this
whole
region
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
in
the
same
year
says
that
it
is
grateful
to
notice
how
much
the
indians
condition
is
ameliorated
under
the
policy
of
removal
he
says
that
they
protected
by
the
strong
arm
of
the
government
and
dwelling
on
lands
and
permanently
established
as
their
own
enjoying
a
delightful
climate
and
a
fertile
soil
turn
their
attention
to
the
cultivation
of
the
earth
and
abandon
the
chase
for
the
surer
supply
of
domestic
animals
this
commissioner
apparently
does
not
remember
perhaps
never
read
the
records
of
the
great
fields
of
corn
which
the
delawares
had
on
the
miami
river
in
and
how
they
returned
twice
that
summer
and
replanted
them
after
general
wayne
had
cut
down
and
burnt
the
young
crops
they
had
turned
their
attention
to
the
cultivation
of
the
soil
forty
years
ago
and
that
was
what
came
of
it
we
shall
see
how
much
better
worth
while
it
may
be
for
them
to
plant
corn
in
their
new
permanent
home
than
it
was
in
their
last
one
the
printed
records
of
indian
affairs
for
the
first
forty
years
of
this
century
are
meagre
and
unsatisfactory
had
the
practice
prevailed
then
as
at
the
present
time
of
printing
full
annual
reports
for
the
different
tribes
it
would
be
possible
to
know
much
which
is
now
forever
locked
up
in
the
traditions
and
the
memories
of
the
indians
themselves
for
ten
years
after
the
making
of
this
last
quoted
treaty
there
is
little
official
mention
of
the
delawares
by
name
beyond
the
mention
in
the
fiscal
reports
of
the
sums
paid
to
them
as
annuities
and
for
education
in
the
commissioner
says
the
agent
for
the
delawares
and
shawnees
states
that
he
was
shown
cloth
that
was
spun
and
wove
and
shirts
and
other
clothing
made
by
the
indian
girls
in
the
delawares
are
reported
as
cultivating
one
thousand
five
hundred
acres
of
land
in
grain
and
vegetables
and
raising
a
great
many
hogs
cattle
and
horses
they
are
a
brave
enterprising
people
and
at
peace
with
all
neighboring
indians
parties
of
them
frequently
make
excursions
into
the
rocky
mountains
after
beaver
and
return
with
a
rich
reward
sometimes
as
much
as
one
thousand
dollars
to
an
individual
but
their
money
is
soon
spent
chiefly
for
ardent
spirits
the
agent
says
the
only
hinderance
now
in
the
way
of
the
delawares
shawnees
and
kickapoos
is
ardent
spirits
these
whiskey
traffickers
who
seem
void
of
all
conscience
rob
and
murder
many
of
these
indians
i
say
will
get
them
drunk
and
then
take
their
horses
guns
or
blankets
off
their
backs
regardless
of
how
quick
they
may
freeze
to
death
i
say
they
not
directly
indirectly
they
furnish
the
make
them
drunk
and
when
drunk
they
kill
their
some
freeze
to
death
when
drunk
several
drunken
indians
have
been
drowned
in
the
missouri
river
this
season
aiming
to
cross
when
drunk
in
the
chiefs
of
the
delawares
met
together
and
prepared
a
remarkable
document
which
was
forwarded
to
the
secretary
of
war
in
this
paper
they
requested
that
all
the
school
funds
to
which
they
were
entitled
by
treaty
provisions
might
be
paid
to
the
indian
manual
labor
school
near
the
fort
leavenworth
agency
might
be
pledged
to
that
school
for
ten
years
to
come
and
that
they
might
therefor
be
guaranteed
the
education
and
subsistence
of
delaware
children
not
exceeding
fifty
at
any
one
time
it
came
out
in
course
of
this
negotiation
that
two
thousand
dollars
were
due
them
on
arrearages
of
their
school
fund
the
secretary
acceded
to
this
request
but
imposed
five
conditions
upon
it
of
which
the
fourth
seems
worth
chronicling
as
an
indication
of
the
helplessness
of
the
delawares
in
the
matter
of
the
disposition
of
their
own
money
the
interest
to
be
paid
annually
when
it
may
suit
the
treasury
and
this
ratification
to
be
subject
to
withdrawal
and
the
agreement
itself
to
rescission
and
to
be
annulled
at
the
pleasure
of
the
department
in
the
delawares
raise
a
sufficiency
to
subsist
on
the
women
do
a
large
portion
of
the
work
on
the
farms
in
many
families
however
the
women
do
not
work
on
the
farm
they
raise
corn
pumpkins
beans
pease
cabbages
potatoes
and
many
kinds
of
garden
vegetables
some
few
raise
wheat
and
oats
they
have
lately
had
built
out
of
their
own
means
a
good
saw
and
grist
mill
with
two
run
of
stones
one
for
corn
and
the
other
for
wheat
there
is
a
constant
stream
called
the
stranger
in
their
country
that
affords
excellent
water
privileges
on
this
stream
their
mills
are
built
at
this
time
they
are
waiting
with
much
anxiety
to
see
if
their
great
father
will
punish
the
sioux
who
have
at
two
different
times
attacked
them
and
murdered
in
all
some
thirty
men
they
say
they
do
not
wish
to
offend
and
disobey
their
great
father
and
before
they
attempt
to
revenge
themselves
they
will
wait
and
see
if
their
great
father
will
compel
the
sioux
to
make
reparation
in
almost
every
family
is
well
supplied
with
and
they
have
raised
abundance
of
corn
some
wheat
potatoes
oats
and
garden
vegetables
have
made
butter
and
cheese
and
raised
fruit
etc
they
dwell
in
good
and
some
have
extremely
neat
houses
well
furnished
they
have
their
outhouses
stables
lots
and
some
have
good
barns
there
are
seventy
scholars
in
one
school
alone
that
are
taught
by
the
friends
and
the
teacher
reports
it
is
truly
astonishing
to
see
the
rapidity
with
which
they
acquire
knowledge
the
boys
work
on
the
farm
part
of
the
time
and
soon
learn
how
to
do
what
they
are
set
at
the
girls
spend
a
part
of
their
time
in
doing
housework
sewing
etc
many
of
them
do
the
sewing
of
their
own
and
some
of
the
clothes
of
the
other
children
in
the
delawares
are
recorded
as
being
among
the
most
remarkable
of
our
colonized
tribes
by
their
intrepidity
and
varied
enterprise
they
are
distinguished
in
a
high
degree
besides
being
industrious
farmers
and
herdsmen
they
hunt
and
trade
all
over
the
interior
of
the
continent
carrying
their
traffic
beyond
the
great
salt
lake
and
exposing
themselves
to
a
thousand
perils
their
agent
gives
in
his
report
for
this
year
a
graphic
account
of
an
incident
such
as
has
only
too
often
occurred
on
our
frontier
a
small
party
of
delawares
consisting
of
a
man
his
squaw
and
a
lad
about
eighteen
years
of
age
recently
returning
from
the
mountains
with
the
avails
and
profits
of
a
successful
hunt
and
traffic
after
they
had
commenced
their
journey
homeward
the
second
day
the
man
sickened
and
died
before
he
died
he
directed
his
squaw
and
the
young
man
to
hasten
home
with
their
horses
and
in
money
four
hundred
and
dollars
besides
many
other
articles
of
value
after
a
few
days
travel
near
some
of
the
forts
on
the
arkansas
they
were
overtaken
by
four
white
men
deserters
from
the
united
states
on
foot
and
one
riding
a
mule
the
squaw
and
young
man
loaned
each
of
the
men
on
foot
a
horse
or
mule
to
ride
and
furnished
them
with
provisions
they
all
travelled
on
friendly
together
for
some
six
or
seven
days
till
they
arrived
at
cottonwood
creek
or
forty
miles
west
of
council
grove
one
evening
while
resting
the
young
man
was
killed
by
these
men
and
the
squaw
was
also
supposed
by
these
wretches
to
be
dead
having
had
her
throat
cut
badly
and
her
head
fractured
the
two
were
then
dragged
off
in
the
grass
supposed
to
be
dead
the
men
gathered
the
mules
horses
money
guns
that
they
supposed
of
made

jackson
county
missouri
where
they
disposed
of
the
stock
as
best
they
could
and
three
of
them
took
steamer
for
louis
the
squaw
on
the
day
after
resuscitated
and
soon
discovering
that
her
companion
had
been
killed
and
everything
they
possessed
had
disappeared
she
in
her
feeble
and
dangerous
condition
took
the
road
to
council
grove
the
fifth
day
she
says
she
was
overtaken
by
a
kaw
indian
and
brought
into
council
grove
where
the
traders
had
every
attention
paid
her
and
sent
a
runner
to
the
delaware
traders
and
myself
and
we
soon
succeeded
in
capturing
one
of
the
men
in
liberty
clay
county
missouri
where
he
confessed
the
whole
murder
robbing
etc
the
three
others
had
left
for
louis
a
telegraphic
despatch
to
louis
however
had
the
desired
effect
and
the
three
men
were
taken
and
brought
back
to
liberty
where
on
trial
before
two
justices
of
the
peace
they
were
committed
for
trial
in
the
district
court
of
the
united
states
for
the
state
of
missouri
as
feeble
as
the
squaw
was
i
was
under
the
necessity
of
having
her
taken
to
liberty
as
a
witness
she
readily
recognized
and
pointed
out
in
a
large
crowd
of
persons
three
of
the
prisoners
i
have
caused
four
of
the
recovered
mules
and
horses
to
be
turned
over
to
the
unfortunate
squaw
i
expect
to
recover
two
or
three
more
the
balance
i
am
of
opinion
will
never
be
obtained
in
the
report
of
the
indian
commissioner
for
this
year
there
is
also
a
paragraph
which
should
not
be
omitted
from
this
sketch
the
present
seems
to
be
an
appropriate
occasion
for
calling
the
attention
of
congress
to
certain
treaty
stipulations
with
various
indian
tribes
which
the
government
for
a
number
of
years
has
failed
to
execute
in
consideration
of
the
cession
of
their
lands
to
the
united
states
some
nine
tribes
of
the
mississippi
and
missouri
regions
among
whom
were
the
it
was
stipulated
on
the
part
of
the
government
that
certain
sums
should
be
paid
to
said
tribes
amounting
in
the
aggregate
to
and
that
the
same
should
be
invested
in
safe
and
profitable
stocks
yielding
an
interest
of
not
less
than
five
per
cent
per
annum
owing
however
to
the
embarrassed
condition
of
the
treasury
it
was
deemed
advisable
by
congress
in
lieu
of
making
the
investments
to
appropriate
from
year
to
year
a
sum
equal
to
the
annual
interest
at
five
per
cent
on
the
several
amounts
required
to
be
invested
on
this
amount
the
government
has
already
paid
from
its
treasury
sum
which
is
now
equal
to
of
the
principal
and
will
in
a
few
years
be
equal
to
the
whole
if
the
practice
of
appropriating
the
interest
be
continued
as
there
is
no
limitation
to
the
period
of
these
payments
such
a
policy
indefinitely
continued
would
prove
a
most
costly
one
to
the
government
at
the
end
of
every
twenty
years
it
will
have
paid
from
the
public
treasury
by
way
of
interest
the
full
amount
of
the
stipulated
investments
the
public
finances
are
in
a
prosperous
condition
instead
of
fiscal
embarrassment
there
is
now
a
redundancy
of
money
and
one
of
the
vexed
questions
of
the
day
is
what
shall
be
done
with
the
surplus
in
the
treasury
considering
the
premises
it
seems
to
be
quite
clear
that
so
much
thereof
as
may
be
necessary
for
the
purpose
should
be
promptly
applied
to
the
fulfilment
of
our
treaty
obligations
in
the
influx
of
white
settlers
into
kansas
was
so
great
it
became
evident
that
the
indian
reservations
there
could
not
be
kept
intact
and
the
delawares
made
a
large
cession
of
their
lands
back
to
the
united
states
to
be
restored
to
the
public
domain
for
this
they
were
to
receive
ten
thousand
dollars
the
sixth
article
of
this
treaty
provided
for
the
giving
of
annuities
to
their
chiefs
the
delawares
feel
now
as
heretofore
grateful
to
their
old
chiefs
for
their
long
and
faithful
services
in
former
treaties
when
their
means
were
scanty
they
provided
by
small
life
annuities
for
the
wants
of
the
chiefs
some
of
whom
are
now
receiving
them
these
chiefs
are
poor
and
the
delawares
believe
it
their
duty
to
keep
them
from
want
in
their
old
age
the
sum
of
ten
thousand
dollars
therefore
was
to
be
paid
to
their
five
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
a
year
each
article
second
provided
that
the
president
should
cause
the
land
now
reserved
for
their
permanent
home
to
be
surveyed
at
any
time
when
they
desired
it
in
the
same
manner
as
the
ceded
country
was
being
surveyed
for
the
white
settlers
in
the
following
year
their
agent
writes
thus
of
the
results
which
have
followed
the
opening
of
this
large
tract
to
white
settlers
the
indians
have
experienced
enough
to
shake
their
confidence
in
the
laws
which
govern
the
white
race
the
irruptions
of
intruders
on
their
trust
lands
their
bloody
dissensions
among
themselves
outbreaks
of
party
must
necessarily
to
these
unsophisticated
people
have
presented
our
system
of
government
in
an
unfavorable
light
numerous
wrongs
have
been
perpetrated
on
many
parts
of
the
reserve
the
white
men
have
wasted
their
most
valuable
timber
with
an
unsparing
hand
the
trust
lands
have
been
greatly
injured
in
consequence
of
the
settlements
made
thereon
the
indians
have
complained
but
to
no
purpose
i
have
found
it
useless
to
threaten
legal
proceedings
the
government
is
bound
in
good
faith
to
protect
this
people
the
agricultural
portion
of
this
tribe
have
done
well
this
season
abundant
crops
of
corn
promise
them
a
supply
of
food
for
the
ensuing
year
the
trustingness
of
these
people
is
astonishing
even
now
they
assent
to
an
article
in
this
treaty
which
says
that
as
the
means
arising
from
the
sale
of
all
this
land
they
had
given
up
would
be
more
than
they
could
use
the
remainder
should
be
from
time
to
time
invested
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
in
safe
and
profitable
stocks
the
principal
to
remain
unimpaired
and
the
interest
to
be
applied
annually
for
the
civilization
education
and
religious
culture
of
the
delaware
people
and
such
other
objects
of
a
beneficial
character
as
in
his
judgment
are
proper
and
necessary
another
article
stipulates
that
if
any
of
the
delawares
are
worthless
or
idle
the
president
can
withhold
their
share
of
the
moneys
article
fifteenth
says
gravely
the
primary
object
of
this
instrument
being
to
advance
the
interests
and
welfare
of
the
delaware
people
it
is
agreed
that
if
it
prove
insufficient
to
effect
these
ends
from
causes
which
can
not
now
be
foreseen
congress
may
hereafter
make
such
farther
provision
by
law
not
inconsistent
herewith
as
experience
may
prove
to
be
necessary
to
promote
the
interests
peace
and
happiness
of
the
delaware
people
in
the
united
states
made
its
next
treaty
with
the
delawares
in
which
they
consented
to
give
the
leavenworth
pawnee
and
western
railroad
company
right
of
way
and
certain
lands
in
their
reserve
in
another
treaty
in
which
as
the
railway
company
had
not
paid
and
was
not
able
to
pay
the
which
it
had
promised
to
pay
the
delawares
the
president
authorized
the
commissioners
of
indian
affairs
to
take
the
bonds
of
said
railroad
for
that
amount
and
a
mortgage
on
one
hundred
thousand
acres
of
the
land
which
the
indians
had
sold
to
the
railway
company
there
was
another
very
curious
bit
of
legislation
in
regard
to
the
delawares
this
year
an
act
of
congress
authorizing
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
enter
on
his
books
to
the
credit
of
the
delawares
being
the
amount
of
bonds
which
the
united
states
had
invested
for
the
delawares
in
state
bonds
of
missouri
tennessee
and
north
carolina
and
which
had
been
stolen
while
in
the
custody
of
jacob
thompson
late
secretary
of
the
interior
in
whose
department
they
had
been
deposited
for
at
the
same
time
there
were
stolen
belonging
to
the
iowas
and
belonging
to
the
confederated
bands
of
kaskaskias
peorias
piankeshaws
and
keas
in
this
year
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
visited
the
delawares
and
reported
them
well
advanced
in
civilization
in
possession
of
comfortable
dwellings
and
farms
with
personal
property
averaging
one
thousand
dollars
to
an
individual
many
of
them
were
traders
and
travelled
even
to
the
boundaries
of
california
in
two
regiments
of
delawares
and
osages
enlisted
as
soldiers
in
an
expedition
to
the
indian
territory
under
colonel
weer
who
says
of
them
the
indian
soldiers
have
far
exceeded
the
most
sanguine
expectations
they
bore
the
brunt
of
the
fighting
done
by
the
expedition
and
had
they
been
properly
sustained
would
have
effectually
ended
the
sway
of
the
rebels
in
the
indian
territory
there
was
during
this
year
a
terrible
condition
of
affairs
in
kansas
and
the
indian
territory
the
indians
were
largely
on
the
side
of
the
rebels
yet
as
the
indian
commissioner
said
in
his
report
for
this
paragraph
which
is
certainly
a
species
of
irish
while
the
rebelling
of
a
large
portion
of
most
of
the
tribes
abrogates
treaty
obligations
and
places
them
at
our
mercy
the
very
important
fact
should
not
be
forgotten
that
the
government
first
wholly
failed
to
keep
its
treaty
stipulations
with
them
in
protecting
them
by
withdrawing
all
the
troops
from
the
forts
in
the
indian
territory
it
left
them
at
the
mercy
of
the
rebels
that
is
we
first
broke
the
treaty
and
then
their
subsequent
failure
to
observe
it
placed
them
at
our
mercy
it
is
he
says
a
fact
that
in
many
instances
compelled
them
to
make
the
best
terms
they
could
with
the
rebels
and
that
this
is
the
case
has
been
proved
by
a
large
number
of
them
joining
our
army
as
soon
as
a
sufficient
force
had
penetrated
their
country
to
make
it
safe
for
them
to
do
so
the
delawares
enlisted
in
one
hundred
and
seventy
men
in
the
union
army
and
this
out
of
a
population
of
only
two
hundred
males
between
the
ages
of
eighteen
and
there
was
probably
no
instance
in
the
whole
country
of
such
a
ratio
of
volunteers
as
this
they
were
reported
as
being
in
the
army
tractable
sober
watchful
and
obedient
to
the
commands
of
their
superiors
they
officered
their
own
companies
and
the
use
of
spirituous
liquors
was
strictly
prohibited
among
fact
the
more
remarkable
as
drunkenness
was
one
of
their
chief
vices
at
home
already
however
the
interests
of
the
white
settlers
in
kansas
were
beginning
to
be
clearly
in
opposition
to
the
interests
of
the
indians
circumscribed
as
they
are
and
closely
surrounded
by
white
settlements
i
can
see
nothing
in
the
future
for
them
but
destruction
says
the
commissioner
i
think
it
is
for
the
interest
of
the
indians
that
they
be
removed
to
some
other
locality
as
soon
as
possible
several
of
them
have
from
fifty
to
one
hundred
acres
of
land
in
cultivation
with
comfortable
dwellings
barns
and
all
the
families
are
domiciled
in
houses
their
crops
of
corn
will
yield
largely
nearly
every
family
will
have
a
sufficiency
for
their
own
consumption
and
many
of
the
larger
farmers
a
surplus
there
are
but
few
delaware
children
of
the
age
of
twelve
or
fourteen
that
can
not
read
here
is
a
community
of
a
thousand
people
larger
than
many
of
the
farming
villages
in
new
england
for
instance
the
average
of
personal
property
amounting
to
one
thousand
dollars
all
living
in
their
own
houses
cultivating
from
fifty
to
one
hundred
acres
of
land
nearly
all
the
children
in
schools
and
yet
it
is
for
their
interest
to
be
moved
the
last
sentence
of
the
following
paragraph
tells
the
story
when
peace
is
restored
to
our
country
a
removal
of
all
the
indians
in
kansas
will
certainly
be
advantageous
to
them
as
well
as
to
the
state
in
their
agent
writes
since
the
question
of
the
removal
of
the
indians
from
kansas
has
been
agitated
improvements
have
been
much
retarded
among
the
delawares
and
other
indians
in
kansas
i
think
they
are
sufficiently
prepared
to
make
new
treaties
with
the
government
having
in
view
settlement
in
the
southern
country
of
those
who
elect
to
emigrate
compensation
for
the
homes
they
relinquish
and
a
permission
to
remain
in
their
present
homes
for
all
who
are
opposed
to
leaving
kansas
at
this
time
the
adult
population
are
in
the
volunteer
service
of
the
united
states
they
make
the
best
of
soldiers
and
are
highly
valued
by
their
officers
no
state
in
the
union
has
furnished
so
many
men
for
our
armies
from
the
same
ratio
of
population
as
has
the
delaware
tribe
the
tribe
has
acres
of
land
under
cultivation
in
corn
wheat
oats
and
potatoes
and
yet
the
adult
men
are
away
in
this
year
the
delawares
being
sufficiently
prepared
to
make
new
treaties
looking
to
their
removal
out
of
the
way
of
the
white
settlers
in
kansas
petitioned
the
united
states
government
to
permit
them
to
take
eight
hundred
dollars
of
their
annuity
funds
to
pay
the
expense
of
sending
a
delegation
of
their
chiefs
to
the
rocky
mountains
to
see
if
they
could
find
there
a
country
which
would
answer
for
their
new
home
the
commissioner
advises
that
they
should
not
be
allowed
to
go
there
but
to
the
indian
territory
of
which
he
says
the
geographical
situation
is
such
that
its
occupation
by
lawless
whites
can
be
more
easily
prevented
than
any
other
portion
of
the
country
by
common
consent
this
appears
to
be
recognized
as
the
indian
country
and
i
have
strong
hopes
that
it
will
eventually
prove
for
them
a
prosperous
and
happy
home
in
their
agent
writes
that
the
greater
part
of
the
personal
property
owned
by
the
delawares
is
in
stock
which
is
constantly
being
preyed
upon
by
the
whites
until
it
has
become
so
reduced
that
it
is
difficult
to
obtain
a
good
animal
in
the
nation
he
says
he
is
unable
for
the
want
of
proper
information
to
determine
what
amount
they
had
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
but
believes
from
observation
that
it
has
undergone
a
depletion
to
the
extent
of
twenty
thousand
dollars
in
the
past
year
what
a
picture
of
a
distressed
community
the
men
away
at
war
old
men
women
and
children
working
the
farms
and
twenty
thousand
dollars
of
stock
stolen
from
them
in
one
year
in
a
large
proportion
of
those
who
had
enlisted
in
the
united
states
army
were
mustered
out
and
returned
home
the
agent
says
it
affords
me
great
pleasure
to
chronicle
the
continued
loyalty
of
this
tribe
during
the
past
four
years
and
as
events
tend
westward
they
evince
every
disposition
to
aid
the
government
by
contributing
their
knowledge
of
the
country
to
the
officers
of
the
army
and
rendering
such
services
thereto
as
they
are
qualified
to
perform
they
have
distinguished
themselves
in
many
instances
in
the
conflicts
on
the
borders
nevertheless
in
this
same
year
these
discharged
soldiers
were
prohibited
by
the
government
from
carrying
revolvers
when
the
commissioner
instructed
the
agent
to
disarm
them
the
agent
very
properly
replied
stating
the
difficulties
in
the
case
firstly
what
disposition
is
to
be
made
of
weapons
taken
forcibly
from
these
indians
secondly
many
of
these
indians
are
intelligent
only
using
weapons
when
any
white
person
would
have
done
so
and
if
one
class
is
disarmed
all
must
be
on
which
the
commissioner
so
modified
his
order
as
to
say
that
peaceably
disposed
indians
might
keep
the
usual
weapons
used
by
them
in
hunting
but
whenever
they
visited
agencies
or
towns
they
must
deliver
up
all
weapons
to
the
agent
who
would
receipt
for
them
and
return
them
at
proper
times
this
order
is
to
be
enforced
if
possible
by
an
appeal
to
their
better
judgment
there
are
no
records
of
the
practical
working
of
this
order
very
possibly
it
fell
at
once
by
its
own
weight
into
the
already
large
category
of
laws
in
regard
to
indians
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
an
indian
who
had
served
four
years
as
an
officer
in
the
army
for
the
delawares
officered
their
own
companies
submitting
to
be
disarmed
by
an
agent
on
any
day
when
he
might
need
to
go
to
atchison
on
business
probably
even
that
appeal
to
his
better
judgment
which
the
commissioner
recommends
would
only
draw
from
him
a
very
forcible
statement
to
the
effect
that
any
man
who
went
about
in
kansas
at
that
time
unarmed
was
a
fool
in
the
indian
commissioner
reports
that
the
state
of
kansas
is
fast
being
filled
by
an
energetic
population
who
appreciate
good
land
and
as
the
indian
reservations
were
selected
as
being
the
best
in
the
state
but
result
can
be
expected
to
most
of
the
indians
are
anxious
to
move
to
the
indian
country
south
of
kansas
where
white
settlers
can
not
interfere
with
them
intermingled
as
the
kansas
reservations
are
with
the
public
lands
and
surrounded
in
most
cases
by
white
settlers
who
too
often
act
on
the
principle
that
an
indian
has
no
rights
that
a
white
man
is
bound
to
respect
they
are
injured
and
annoyed
in
many
ways
their
stock
are
stolen
their
fences
broken
down
their
timber
destroyed
their
young
men
plied
with
whiskey
their
women
debauched
so
that
while
the
uncivilized
are
kept
in
a
worse
than
savage
state
having
the
crimes
of
civilization
forced
upon
them
those
farther
advanced
and
disposed
to
honest
industry
are
discouraged
beyond
endurance
in
spite
of
all
this
the
delawares
raised
in
bushels
of
grain
bushels
of
potatoes
and
owned
head
of
cattle
in
july
of
this
year
a
treaty
was
made
with
them
providing
for
the
removal
to
the
indian
territory
of
all
who
should
not
decide
to
become
citizens
of
kansas
and
the
sale
of
their
lands
the
superintendent
of
the
fort
leavenworth
agency
writes
at
this
time
the
running
of
the
union
pacific
railroad
through
the
delawares
diminished
reserve
has
been
a
source
of
grievous
annoyance
and
damage
to
the
delawares
as
has
also
an
organization
styled
the
delaware
lumber
company
out
of
these
two
companies
grew
much
complaint
and
investigation
resulting
in
the
appointment
of
a
special
agent
to
sell
to
the
railroad
the
timber
required
for
the
construction
of
the
road
and
no
more
the
delaware
lumber
company
being
thus
restricted
being
prevented
from
helping
themselves
to
the
indians
timber
immediately
gave
up
their
business
and
stopped
their
mills
but
not
before
they
had
damaged
the
indians
property
to
the
amount
of
thousand
dollars
twenty
thousand
dollars
worth
of
stock
and
thousand
dollars
worth
of
timber
having
been
stolen
in
two
years
from
this
little
village
of
farmers
no
wonder
they
are
sufficiently
prepared
to
move
other
causes
have
conspired
also
to
render
them
in
haste
to
be
gone
the
perpetual
expectation
of
being
obliged
to
remove
had
unsettled
the
whole
community
and
made
them
indifferent
to
effort
and
improvement
the
return
of
their
young
men
from
the
war
had
also
had
a
demoralizing
effect
drunken
frays
were
not
uncommon
in
which
deadly
weapons
were
used
spite
of
the
department
regulations
for
disarming
all
indians
in
july
of
this
year
the
delaware
chiefs
distressed
by
this
state
of
affairs
drew
up
for
their
nation
a
code
of
laws
which
compare
favorably
with
the
laws
of
civilized
states
footnote
see
appendix
art
in
the
delawares
are
said
to
be
very
impatient
to
be
gone
from
their
reserve
in
order
to
build
houses
this
autumn
for
winter
use
and
to
be
fencing
fields
for
the
ensuing
year
at
their
new
reserve
the
annuities
due
them
in
april
of
this
year
have
not
been
paid
till
autumn
and
this
has
delayed
their
movements
many
of
the
young
men
are
still
away
acting
as
scouts
and
guides
in
the
army
in
the
course
of
this
year
and
the
next
the
whole
tribe
moved
by
detachments
to
their
new
home
those
who
removed
during
the
winter
went
to
work
in
a
laudable
manner
and
made
their
building
comfortable
houses
and
raising
respectable
crops
the
first
season
they
are
said
to
be
now
in
a
fair
way
to
be
better
off
than
ever
before
they
have
given
up
their
tribal
organization
and
become
cherokee
citizens
they
report
that
they
are
well
pleased
with
their
new
homes
and
being
separated
from
the
many
temptations
by
which
they
were
surrounded
in
their
old
reservation
are
learning
to
appreciate
the
many
benefits
to
be
derived
from
leading
a
temperate
industrious
and
consequently
a
prosperous
and
happy
life
in
it
is
said
that
as
soon
as
the
final
arrangement
relative
to
their
funds
is
perfected
they
will
lose
their
nationality
and
become
identified
with
the
cherokees
in
we
find
nearly
all
the
delawares
in
indian
territory
but
it
seems
that
owing
to
a
carelessly
surveyed
boundary
some
three
hundred
of
them
had
settled
down
on
lands
which
were
outside
the
cherokee
reservation
and
had
been
assigned
by
the
government
to
the
osages
this
unfortunate
three
hundred
therefore
are
removed
again
this
time
to
the
lands
of
the
peorias
where
they
ask
permission
to
establish
themselves
but
in
the
mean
time
as
they
had
made
previous
arrangements
with
the
cherokees
and
all
their
funds
had
been
transferred
to
the
cherokee
nation
it
is
thought
to
be
very
unfortunate
that
they
should
be
thus
obliged
to
seek
a
new
home
and
it
is
said
to
be
quite
desirable
that
the
parties
in
interest
should
reconcile
their
unsettled
affairs
to
mutual
advantage
we
are
too
much
inclined
to
read
these
records
carelessly
without
trying
to
picture
to
ourselves
the
condition
of
affairs
which
they
represent
it
has
come
to
be
such
an
accepted
thing
in
the
history
and
fate
of
the
indian
that
he
is
to
be
always
pushed
on
always
in
advance
of
what
is
called
the
march
of
civilization
that
to
the
average
mind
statements
of
these
repeated
removals
come
with
no
startling
force
and
suggest
no
vivid
picture
of
details
only
a
sort
of
reassertion
of
an
abstract
general
principle
but
pausing
to
consider
for
a
moment
what
such
statements
actually
mean
and
involve
imagining
such
processes
applied
to
some
particular
town
or
village
that
we
happen
to
be
intimately
acquainted
with
we
can
soon
come
to
a
new
realization
of
the
full
bearing
and
import
of
them
such
uprooting
such
perplexity
such
loss
such
confusion
and
uncertainty
inflicted
once
on
any
community
of
white
people
anywhere
in
our
land
would
be
considered
quite
enough
to
destroy
its
energies
and
blight
its
prospects
for
years
it
may
very
well
be
questioned
whether
any
of
our
small
communities
would
have
recovered
from
such
successive
shocks
changes
and
forced
migrations
as
soon
and
as
well
as
have
many
of
these
indian
tribes
it
is
very
certain
that
they
would
not
have
submitted
to
them
as
patiently
after
this
we
find
in
the
official
reports
no
distinctive
mention
of
the
delawares
by
name
except
of
a
few
who
had
been
for
some
time
living
in
the
indian
territory
and
were
not
included
in
the
treaty
provisions
at
the
time
of
the
removal
from
kansas
this
little
in
all
that
now
remain
to
bear
the
name
of
that
strong
and
friendly
people
to
whom
a
little
more
than
one
hundred
years
ago
we
promised
that
they
should
be
our
brothers
forever
and
be
entitled
to
a
representation
in
our
congress
this
band
of
delawares
is
associated
with
six
other
dwindled
remnants
of
caddoes
ionies
wichitas
towaconies
wacoes
keechies
and
the
wichita
agency
in
indian
territory
they
are
all
reported
as
being
peaceable
well
disposed
and
actively
engaged
in
agricultural
pursuits
of
the
delawares
it
is
said
in
that
they
were
not
able
to
cultivate
so
much
land
as
they
had
intended
to
during
that
year
on
account
of
loss
of
stock
by
even
here
it
seems
in
that
indian
country
south
of
kansas
where
as
they
were
told
white
settlers
could
not
interfere
with
them
enemies
lie
in
wait
for
them
as
of
old
to
rob
and
destroy
even
here
the
government
is
as
before
unable
to
protect
them
and
in
all
probability
the
tragedies
of
and
will
before
long
be
with
still
sadder
results
chapter
iii
the
cheyennes
our
first
treaty
with
the
cheyennes
was
made
in
at
the
mouth
of
the
teton
river
it
was
merely
a
treaty
of
amity
and
friendship
and
acknowledgment
on
the
part
of
the
cheyennes
of
the
supremacy
of
the
united
states
two
years
before
this
president
monroe
reported
the
chayenes
to
be
a
tribe
of
three
thousand
two
hundred
and
fifty
souls
dwelling
and
hunting
on
a
river
of
the
same
name

western
tributary
of
the
missouri
a
little
above
the
great
bend
ten
years
later
catlin
the
famous
painter
of
indians
met
a
shienne
chief
and
squaw
among
the
sioux
and
painted
their
portraits
he
says
the
shiennes
are
a
small
tribe
of
about
three
thousand
in
number
living
neighbors
to
the
sioux
on
the
west
of
them
between
the
black
hills
and
the
rocky
mountains
there
is
no
finer
race
of
men
than
these
in
north
america
and
none
superior
in
stature
except
the
osages
scarcely
a
man
in
the
tribe
full
grown
who
is
less
than
six
feet
in
height
they
are
the
richest
in
horses
of
any
tribe
on
the
continent
living
where
the
greatest
herds
of
wild
horses
are
grazing
on
the
prairies
which
they
catch
in
great
numbers
and
sell
to
the
sioux
mandans
and
other
tribes
as
well
as
to
the
these
people
are
the
most
desperate
set
of
warriors
and
horsemen
having
carried
on
almost
unceasing
wars
with
the
pawnees
and
blackfeet
the
chief
was
clothed
in
a
handsome
dress
of
very
neatly
garnished
with
broad
bands
of
work
down
the
sleeves
of
his
shirt
and
leggings
the
woman
was
comely
and
beautifully
dressed
her
dress
of
the
tastefully
ornamented
with
quills
and
beads
and
her
hair
plaited
in
large
braids
that
hung
down
on
her
breast
in
the
agent
for
the
sioux
cheyennes
and
poncas
reports
that
all
these
indians
live
exclusively
by
the
chase
and
that
seems
to
be
the
sum
and
substance
of
his
information
about
them
he
adds
also
that
these
remote
wandering
tribes
have
a
great
fear
of
the
border
tribes
and
wish
to
avoid
them
in
the
cheyennes
are
reported
as
carrying
on
trade
at
a
post
on
the
arkansas
river
near
the
santa
fe
road
but
still
depending
on
the
chase
in
they
are
spoken
of
as
a
wandering
tribe

the
platte
and
in
the
same
year
mitchell
supt
of
indian
affairs
with
his
at
louis
writes
generations
will
pass
away
before
this
territory
the
territory
in
which
the
wild
tribes
of
the
upper
mississippi
were
then
wandering
becomes
much
more
circumscribed
for
if
we
draw
a
line
running
north
and
south
so
as
to
cross
the
missouri
about
the
mouth
of
the
vermilion
river
we
shall
designate
the
limits
beyond
which
civilized
men
are
never
likely
to
settle
at
this
point
the
creator
seems
to
have
said
to
the
tides
of
emigration
that
are
annually
rolling
toward
the
west
far
shalt
thou
go
and
no
farther
at
all
events
if
they
go
beyond
this
they
will
never
stop
on
the
east
side
of
the
rocky
mountains
the
utter
destitution
of
timber
the
sterility
of
sandy
soil
together
with
the
coldness
and
dryness
of
the
climate
furnish
obstacles
which
not
even
yankee
enterprise
is
likely
to
overcome
a
beneficent
creator
seems
to
have
intended
this
dreary
region
as
an
asylum
for
the
indians
when
the
force
of
circumstances
shall
have
driven
them
from
the
last
acre
of
the
fertile
soil
which
they
once
possessed
here
no
inducements
are
offered
to
the
saxon
breed
to
erect
their
huts
the
time
may
arrive
when
the
whole
of
the
western
indians
will
be
forced
to
seek
a
in
this
great
american
desert
and
this
in
all
probability
will
form
a
new
era
in
the
history
of
this
singular
and
race
they
will
remain
a
wandering
half
civilized
though
happy
people
flocks
and
herds
will
cover
a
thousand
hills
and
will
furnish
beef
and
mutton
for
a
portion
of
the
dense
population
of
whites
that
will
swarm
in
the
more
fertile
sections
of
the
great
valley
of

remonstrances
with
one
of
the
sioux
chiefs
in
regard
to
their
perpetual
warring
with
each
other
the
chief
was
very
laconic
and
decided
remarking
if
their
desired
them
to
cease
to
war
with
their
enemies
why
did
he
not
send
each
of
them
a
petticoat
and
make
squaws
of
them
at
once
this
same
chief
refused
to
allow
the
boys
of
his
tribe
to
go
to
the
choctaw
schools
saying
they
would
return
as
the
few
did
who
went
to
louis
drunkards
or
die
on
the
way
the
cheyennes
and
other
indians
living
on
the
platte
complained
bitterly
of
the
passage
of
the
emigrants
through
their
country
they
said
they
ought
to
be
compensated
for
the
right
of
way
and
that
the
emigrants
should
be
restricted
by
law
and
the
presence
of
a
military
force
from
burning
the
grass
and
from
unnecessary
destruction
of
game
they
were
systematically
plundered
and
demoralized
by
traders

without
difficulty
sugar
and

were
sold
at

at

at

a

and
higher
in
a
law
was
passed
by
congress
forbidding
the
introduction
of
whiskey
into
the
indian
country
and
even
the
partial
enforcement
of
this
law
had
a
most
happy
effect
foremost
among
those
to
acknowledge
the
benefits
of
it
were
the
traders
themselves
who
said
that
the
indians
demand
for
substantial
articles
of
trade
was
augmented
two
hundred
per
cent
they
enjoy
much
better
health
look
much
better
and
are
better
people
you
now
rarely
ever
hear
of
a
murder
committed
whereas
when
whiskey
was
plenty
in
that
country
murder
was
a
daily
occurrence
these
indians
themselves
were
said
to
be
opposed
to
the
introduction
of
ardent
spirits
into
their
country
but
like
almost
all
other
indians
will
use
it
if
you
give
it
to
them
and
when
under
its
influence
are
dangerous
and
troublesome
there
were
at
this
time
nearly
thousand
of
these
upper
missouri
indians
five
bands
of
the
sioux
cheyennes
gros
ventres
mandans
and
poncas
excellent
indians
devotedly
attached
to
the
white
man
living
in
peace
and

entitled
to
the
special
favor
and
good
opinion
of
the
department
for
their
uniform
good
conduct
and
pacific
relations
in
it
was
estimated
from
the
returns
made
by
traders
that
the
trade
of
this
agency
amounted
to
among
the
items
were
buffalo
tongues
in
consequence
of
this
prosperity
on
the
part
of
the
indians
there
was
a
partial
cessation
of
hostilities
on
the
whites
but
it
was
still
a
perilous
journey
to
cross
the
plains
and
in
the
necessity
for
making
some
sort
of
treaty
stipulations
with
all
these
wild
tribes
begins
to
be
forced
emphatically
upon
the
attention
of
the
united
states
government
a
safe
highway
across
the
continent
must
be
opened
it
is
a
noticeable
thing
however
that
even
as
late
as
this
in
the
history
of
our
diplomatic
relations
with
the
indian
his
right
to
a
certain
control
as
well
as
occupancy
of
the
soil
was
instinctively
recognized
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
his
report
for
says
the
wild
tribes
of
indians
who
have
their
in
the
great
prairie
through
which
our
emigrants
to
california
pass
have
during
the
year
been
more
than
usually
pacific
they
have
suffered
our
people
to
pass
through
their
country
with
little
interruption
though
they
travelled
in
great
numbers
and
consumed
on
their
route
much
grass
and
game
for
these
the
indians
expect
compensation
and
their
claim
is
just
the
secretary
therefore
concurs
in
the
recommendation
of
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
that
treaties
be
negotiated
with
these
tribes
stipulating
for
the
right
of
way
through
their
country
and
the
use
of
grass
and
game
paying
them
therefor
small
annuities
in
useful
articles
of
merchandise
and
agricultural
implements
and
instruction
the
right
of
way
through
their
country
a
great
deal
is
conceded
covered
and
conveyed
by
such
phrases
as
these
if
they
mean
anything
they
mean
all
that
the
indians
ever
claimed
the
indians
were
supposed
to
be
influenced
to
this
peaceableness
and
more
by
a
hope
of
rewards
and
gifts
than
by
a
wholesome
fear
of
the
power
of
the
government
and
it
was
proposed
to
take
a
delegation
of
chiefs
to
washington
in
order
that
they
may
acquire
some
knowledge
of
our
greatness
and
strength
which
will
make
a
salutary
impression
on
them
and
through
them
on
their
brethren
and
will
tend
to
influence
them
to
continue
peaceful
relations
it
begins
to
dawn
upon
the
government
perception
that
peace
is
cheaper
as
well
as
kinder
than
war
we
never
can
whip
them
into
friendship
says
one
of
the
superintendents
of
the
upper
missouri
agency
a
treaty
can
do
no
harm
and
the
expense
would
be
less
than
that
of
a
six
months
war
justice
as
well
as
policy
requires
that
we
should
make
some
remuneration
for
the
damages
these
indians
sustain
in
consequence
of
the
destruction
of
their
game
timber
by
the
whites
passing
through
their
country
their
game
timber
their
country
again
the
perpetual
recurrence
of
this
possessive
pronoun
and
of
such
phrases
as
these
in
all
that
the
government
has
said
about
the
indians
and
in
all
that
it
has
said
to
them
is
very
significant
in
the
indian
commission
writes
that
it
is
much
to
be
regretted
that
no
appropriation
was
made
at
the
last
session
of
congress
for
negotiating
treaties
with
the
wild
tribes
of
the
plains
these
indians
have
long
held
undisputed
possession
of
this
extensive
region
and
regarding
it
as
their
own
they
consider
themselves
entitled
to
compensation
not
only
for
the
right
of
way
through
their
territory
but
for
the
great
and
injurious
destruction
of
game
grass
and
timber
committed
by
our
troops
and
emigrants
the
bill
providing
for
the
negotiation
of
these
treaties
was
passed
unanimously
by
the
senate
but
the
unhappy
difficulties
existing
on
the
subject
of
slavery
delayed
it
in
the
house
until
it
was
too
late
to
be
carried
into
effect
all
the
tribes
had
been
informed
of
this
pending
bill
and
were
looking
forward
to
it
with
great
interest
and
anxiety
in
they
had
all
expressed
themselves
as
very
anxious
to
be
instructed
in
agriculture
and
the
civilized
arts
already
the
buffalo
herds
were
thinning
and
disappearing
from
time
immemorial
the
buffalo
had
furnished
them
food
clothing
and
shelter
with
its
disappearance
starvation
stared
them
in
the
face
and
they
knew
it
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
at
this
time
all
the
wild
tribes
of
the
upper
missouri
sioux
cheyennes
ready
and
anxious
to
establish
friendly
relations
with
the
united
states
government
and
to
enter
into
some
arrangement
by
which
some
means
of
future
subsistence
and
some
certainty
of
lands
enough
to
live
on
could
be
secured
to
them
meantime
they
hunted
with
greater
diligence
than
ever
and
in
this
one
year
alone
had
sold
to
the
within
the
limits
of
one
agency
worth
of
and
furs
peltries
and
miscellaneous
goods
to
the
amount
of
what
they
thus
receive
for
their
furs
robes
would
be
ample
for
their
support
says
hatton
were
it
not
that
they
have
to
give
such
exorbitant
prices
for
what
they
purchase
from
the
whites
in
the
winter
and
spring
of
all
these
tribes
were
visited
by
an
agent
of
the
government
he
reported
them
as
friendly
disposed
but
very
impatient
to
come
to
some
understanding
about
the
right
of
way
this
is
what
the
indians
want
and
what
they
are
anxious
about
having
been
told
long
since
and
so
often
repeated
by
travellers
passing
who
care
little
about
the
consequences
of
promises
so
they
slip
through
safely
and
unmolested
themselves
that
their
father
would
soon
reward
them
liberally
for
the
right
of
way
the
destruction
of
timber
game
as
well
as
for
any
kindness
shown
americans
passing
through
their
country
in
the
summer
of
this
much
desired
treaty
was
made
seven
of
the
prairie
and
mountain
tribes
gathered
in
great
force
at
fort
laramie
the
report
of
this
council
contains
some
interesting
and
noticeable
points
we
were
eighteen
days
encamped
together
during
which
time
the
indians
conducted
themselves
in
a
manner
that
excited
the
admiration
and
surprise
of
every
one
the
different
tribes
although
hereditary
enemies
interchanged
daily
visits
both
in
their
individual
and
national
capacities
smoked
and
feasted
together
exchanged
presents
adopted
each
other
children
according
to
their
own
customs
and
did
all
that
was
held
sacred
or
solemn
in
the
eyes
of
these
indians
to
prove
the
sincerity
of
their
peaceful
and
friendly
intentions
both
among
themselves
and
with
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
lawfully
residing
among
them
or
passing
through
the
country
by
this
treaty
the
indians
formally
conceded
to
the
united
states
the
right
to
establish
roads
military
or
otherwise
throughout
the
indian
country
so
far
as
they
claim
or
exercise
ownership
over
it
they
agreed
to
maintain
peaceful
relations
among
themselves
and
to
abstain
from
all
depredations
upon
whites
passing
through
their
country
and
to
make
restitution
for
any
damages
or
loss
that
a
white
man
shall
sustain
by
the
acts
of
their
people
for
all
the
damages
which
they
had
suffered
up
to
that
time
in
consequence
of
the
passing
of
the
whites
through
their
country
they
accepted
the
presents
then
received
as
payment
in
full
an
annuity
of
a
year
for
fifty
years
to
come
was
promised
to
them
this
was
the
price
of
the
right
of
way
fifty
thousand
dollars
for
a
limited
period
of
years
is
a
small
amount
to
be
distributed
among
at
least
fifty
thousand
indians
especially
when
we
consider
that
we
have
taken
away
or
are
rapidly
taking
away
from
them
all
means
of
support
says
one
of
the
makers
of
this
treaty
there
would
probably
be
no
dissent
from
this
opinion
a
dollar
a
year
even
assured
to
one
for
fifty
years
seems
hardly
an
adequate
compensation
for
the
surrender
of
all
other
means
of
support
the
report
continues
viewing
the
treaty
in
all
its
provisions
i
am
clearly
of
opinion
that
it
is
the
best
that
could
have
been
made
for
both
parties
i
am
moreover
of
the
opinion
that
it
will
be
observed
and
carried
out
in
as
good
faith
on
the
part
of
the
indians
as
it
will
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
and
the
white
people
thereof
there
was
an
earnest
solemnity
and
a
deep
conviction
of
the
necessity
of
adopting
some
such
measures
evident
in
the
conduct
and
manners
of
the
indians
throughout
the
whole
council
on
leaving
for
their
respective
homes
and
bidding
each
other
adieu
they
gave
the
strongest
possible
evidence
of
their
friendly
intentions
for
the
future
and
the
mutual
confidence
and
good
faith
which
they
had
in
each
other
invitations
were
freely
given
and
as
freely
accepted
by
each
of
the
tribes
to
interchange
visits
talk
and
smoke
together
like
brothers
upon
ground
where
they
had
never
before
met
except
for
the
purpose
of
scalping
each
other
this
to
my
mind
was
conclusive
evidence
of
the
sincerity
of
the
indians
and
nothing
but
bad
management
or
some
untoward
misfortune
ever
can
break
it
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
his
report
for
this
year
speaks
with
satisfaction
of
the
treaties
negotiated
with
indians
during
the
year
and
says
it
can
not
be
denied
that
most
of
the
depredations
committed
by
the
indians
on
our
frontiers
are
the
offspring
of
dire
necessity
the
advance
of
our
population
compels
them
to
relinquish
their
fertile
lands
and
seek
refuge
in
sterile
regions
which
furnish
neither
corn
nor
game
impelled
by
hunger
they
seize
the
horses
mules
and
cattle
of
the
pioneers
to
relieve
their
wants
and
satisfy
the
cravings
of
nature
they
are
immediately
pursued
and
when
overtaken
severely
punished
this
creates
a
feeling
of
revenge
on
their
part
which
seeks
its
gratification
in
outrages
on
the
persons
and
property
of
peaceable
inhabitants
the
whole
country
then
becomes
excited
and
a
desolating
war
attended
with
a
vast
sacrifice
of
blood
and
treasure
ensues
this
it
is
believed
is
a
true
history
of
the
origin
of
most
of
our
indian
hostilities
all
history
admonishes
us
of
the
difficulty
of
civilizing
a
wandering
race
who
live
mainly
upon
game
to
tame
a
savage
you
must
tie
him
down
to
the
soil
you
must
make
him
understand
the
value
of
property
and
the
benefits
of
its
separate
ownership
you
must
appeal
to
those
selfish
principles
implanted
by
divine
providence
in
the
nature
of
man
for
the
wisest
purposes
and
make
them
minister
to
civilization
and
refinement
you
must
encourage
the
appropriation
of
lands
by
individuals
attach
them
to
their
homes
by
the
ties
of
interest
teach
them
the
uses
of
agriculture
and
the
arts
of
peace
and
they
should
be
taught
to
look
forward
to
the
day
when
they
may
be
elevated
to
the
dignity
of
american
citizenship
by
means
like
these
we
shall
soon
reap
our
reward
in
the
suppression
of
indian
depredations
in
the
diminution
of
the
expenses
of
the
department
of
war
in
a
valuable
addition
to
our
productive
population
in
the
increase
of
our
agriculture
and
commerce
and
in
the
proud
consciousness
that
we
have
removed
from
our
national
escutcheon
the
stain
left
on
it
by
our
acknowledged
injustice
to
the
indian
race
we
find
the
cheyennes
therefore
in
pledged
to
peace
and
toward
their
indian
neighbors
and
to
the
white
emigrants
pouring
through
their
country
for
this
conceded
right
of
way
they
are
to
have
a
dollar
a
year
apiece
in
goods
and
animals
and
it
is
supposed
that
they
will
be
able
to
eke
out
this
support
by
hunting
buffaloes
which
are
still
not
extinct
in
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
writes
notwithstanding
the
mountain
and
prairie
indians
continue
to
suffer
from
the
vast
number
of
emigrants
who
pass
through
their
country
destroying
their
means
of
support
and
scattering
disease
and
death
among
them
yet
those
who
were
parties
to
the
treaty
concluded
at
fort
laramie
in
the
fall
of
have
been
true
to
their
obligations
and
have
remained
at
peace
among
themselves
and
with
the
whites
and
the
superintendent
writes
congress
made
a
very
liberal
appropriation
of
to
make
a
treaty
with
the
prairie
and
mountain
tribes
a
very
satisfactory
treaty
was
made
with
them
last
fall
at
fort
laramie
the
conditions
of
which
on
their
part
have
been
faithfully
depredations
having
been
committed
during
the
past
season
by
any
of
the
tribes
parties
to
the
fort
laramie
treaty
the
senate
amended
the
treaty
substituting
instead
of
years
as
the
period
for
which
they
were
to
have
received
an
annual
supply
of
goods
animals
at
the
discretion
of
the
president
this
modification
of
the
treaty
i
think
very
proper
as
the
condition
of
these
wandering
hordes
will
be
entirely
changed
during
the
next
fifteen
years
the
treaty
however
should
have
been
sent
back
to
the
indians
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
their
sanction
to
the
modification
as
was
done
in
the
case
of
the
sioux
treaty
negotiated
by
commissioners
ramsey
and
lea
it
is
hoped
this
oversight
will
be
corrected
as
early
as
practicable
next
spring
otherwise
the
large
amounts
already
expended
will
have
been
uselessly
wasted
and
the
indians
far
more
dissatisfied
than
ever
to
comment
on
the
bad
faith
of
this
action
on
the
part
of
congress
would
be
a
waste
of
words
but
its
impolicy
is
so
glaring
that
astonishment
can
not
keep
impolicy
and
also
its
incredible
niggardliness
a
dollar
apiece
a
year
in
goods
animals
those
indians
had
been
promised
that
they
should
have
for
fifty
years
it
must
have
been
patent
to
the
meanest
intellect
that
this
was
little
to
pay
each
year
to
any
one
man
from
whom
we
were
taking
away
as
the
commissioner
said
his
means
of
support
but
unluckily
for
the
indians
there
were
fifty
thousand
of
them
it
entered
into
some
thrifty
congressman
head
to
multiply
fifty
by
fifty
and
the
aggregate
terrified
everybody
this
was
much
more
likely
to
have
been
the
cause
of
the
amendment
than
the
cause
assigned
by
the
superintendent
the
probable
change
of
localities
of
all
the
wandering
hordes
in
the
next
fifteen
years
no
doubt
it
would
be
troublesome
to
the
last
degree
to
distribute
fifty
thousand
dollars
in
goods
animals
to
fifty
thousand
indians
wandering
over
the
entire
upper
missouri
region
but
no
more
troublesome
surely
in
the
sixteenth
year
than
in
the
fifteenth
the
sophistry
is
too
transparent
it
does
not
in
the
least
gloss
over
the
fact
that
within
the
first
year
after
the
making
of
our
first
treaty
of
any
moment
with
these
they
to
a
man
the
whole
fifty
thousand
of
them
kept
their
faith
with
broke
ours
with
them
in
the
meanest
of
them
of
more
than
of
the
money
we
had
promised
to
pay
all
the
tribes
promptly
assented
to
this
amendment
however
so
says
the
annual
report
of
the
indian
commissioner
for
and
adds
that
with
a
single
exception
they
have
maintained
friendly
relations
among
themselves
and
manifested
an
increasing
confidence
in
and
kindness
toward
the
whites
some
of
them
have
begun
to
raise
corn
beans
pumpkins
but
depend
chiefly
on
the
hunt
for
their
support
but
the
agent
who
was
sent
to
distribute
to
them
their
annuities
and
to
secure
their
assent
to
the
amendment
to
the
treaty
reports
the
cheyennes
and
the
arapahoes
and
many
of
the
sioux
are
actually
in
a
starving
state
they
are
in
abject
want
of
food
half
the
year
and
their
reliance
for
that
scanty
supply
in
the
rapid
decrease
of
the
buffalo
is
fast
disappearing
the
travel
upon
the
roads
drives
them
off
or
else
confines
them
to
a
narrow
path
during
the
period
of
emigration
and
the
different
tribes
are
forced
to
contend
with
hostile
nations
in
seeking
support
for
their
villages
their
women
are
pinched
with
want
and
their
children
constantly
crying
with
hunger
their
arms
moreover
are
unfitted
to
the
pursuit
of
smaller
game
and
thus
the
lapse
of
a
few
years
presents
only
the
prospect
of
a
gradual
famine
and
in
spite
of
such
suffering
these
indians
commit
no
depredations
and
show
increasing
confidence
in
and
kindness
toward
the
whites
this
agent
who
has
passed
many
years
among
the
indians
speaks
with
great
feeling
of
the
sad
prospect
staring
them
in
the
face
he
says
but
one
course
remains
which
promises
any
permanent
relief
to
them
or
any
lasting
benefit
to
the
country
in
which
they
dwell
that
is
simply
to
make
such
modifications
in
the
laws
as
will
invite
the
residence
of
traders
among
them
and
open
the
whole
indian
territory
for
settlement
trade
is
the
only
civilizer
of
the
indian
it
has
been
the
precursor
of
all
civilization
heretofore
and
it
will
be
of
all
hereafter
it
teaches
the
indian
the
value
of
other
things
besides
the
spoils
of
the
chase
and
offers
to
him
other
pursuits
and
excitements
than
those
of
war
all
obstructions
to
its
freedom
therefore
only
operate
injuriously
the
indians
would
soon
lose
their
nomadic
character
and
forget
the
relations
of
tribes
and
this
while
it
would
avoid
the
cruel
necessity
of
our
present
wit
make
them
an
element
in
the
population
and
sharer
in
the
prosperity
of
the
country
he
says
of
the
system
of
removals
and
congregating
tribes
in
small
parcels
of
territory
that
it
has
eventuated
injuriously
on
those
who
have
been
subjected
to
it
it
is
the
legalized
murder
of
a
whole
nation
it
is
expensive
vicious
and
inhuman
and
producing
these
consequences
and
these
alone
the
custom
being
judged
by
its
fruits
should
not
be
persisted
in
it
is
in
the
face
of
such
statements
such
protests
as
these
that
the
united
states
government
has
gone
steadily
on
with
its
policy
so
called
in
regard
to
the
treatment
of
the
indian
in
the
report
from
the
upper
missouri
region
is
still
of
peace
and
fidelity
on
the
part
of
all
the
indians
who
joined
in
the
fort
laramie
treaty
not
a
single
instance
of
murder
robbery
or
other
depredation
has
been
committed
by
them
either
on
the
neighboring
tribes
parties
to
the
treaty
or
on
whites
this
is
the
more
remarkable
as
before
the
treaty
they
were
foremost
in
the
van
of
thieves
and
at
war
pillaging
whoever
they
met
and
annoying
their
own
traders
in
their
own
forts
in
the
summer
of
this
year
the
cheyennes
began
to
be
dissatisfied
and
impertinent
at
a
gathering
of
the
northern
band
at
fort
laramie
one
of
the
chiefs
demanded
that
the
travel
over
the
platte
road
should
be
stopped
he
also
if
the
interpreter
was
to
be
relied
on
said
that
next
year
the
government
must
send
them
out
one
thousand
white
women
for
wives
the
southern
cheyennes
had
given
up
to
their
agent
some
mexican
prisoners
whom
they
had
taken
in
the
spring
and
this
act
it
was
supposed
had
seemed
to
the
northern
band
a
needless
interference
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
moreover
it
was
a
matter
constantly
open
to
the
observation
of
all
friendly
indians
that
the
hostiles
who
were
continually
plundering
and
attacking
emigrant
trains
made
on
the
whole
more
profit
out
of
war
than
they
made
out
of
peace
on
the
north
platte
road
during
this
year
the
pawnees
alone
had
stolen
several
thousands
of
dollars
worth
of
goods
and
in
addition
to
this
there
was
the
pressure
of
public
thing
which
is
as
powerful
among
indians
as
among
whites
it
was
popular
to
be
on
the
the
whites
were
invaders
it
was
brave
and
creditable
to
slay
them
taking
all
these
things
into
account
it
was
only
to
be
wondered
at
that
these
cheyennes
arapahoes
and
sioux
kept
to
the
provisions
of
their
treaty
at
all
nevertheless
the
cheyennes
arapahoes
and
some
bands
of
the
sioux
continued
peaceable
and
friendly
and
in
they
begged
to
be
supplied
with
a
farmer
to
teach
them
how
to
farm
also
with
a
blacksmith
their
agent
strongly
recommends
that
this
be
done
saying
that
there
is
not
in
the
whole
indian
country
a
more
favorable
location
for
a
farm
for
grazing
stock
and
game
than
the
south
platte
in
a
very
short
period
of
time
the
arapahoes
and
cheyennes
would
become
fixed
and
settled
and
a
part
of
each
old
women
and
become
agriculturists
rude
it
is
true
yet
sufficiently
skilful
to
raise
corn
potatoes
and
beans
and
dwell
in
cabins
or
fixed
habitations
in
the
summer
of
the
cheyennes
were
by
a
disastrous
accident
forced
into
the
position
of
hostiles
a
small
went
out
to
attack
the
pawnees
they
were
in
camp
near
the
north
platte
road
as
the
was
passing
two
of
the
cheyennes
ran
toward
it
to
beg
tobacco
the
terrified
fired
on
them
and
the
indians
fired
back
wounding
him
the
chiefs
rushed
out
stopped
the
firing
explained
the
matter
and
then
severely
flogged
the
indians
who
had
returned
the
fire
but
the
mischief
had
been
done
the
reported
his
having
been
fired
at
by
a
cheyenne
indian
and
the
next
day
troops
from
fort
kearny
attacked
the
indians
and
killed
six
of
the
the
rest
refused
to
fight
and
ran
away
leaving
their
camp
and
all
it
contained
the
thoroughly
exasperated
attacked
an
emigrant
train
killed
two
men
and
a
child
and
took
one
woman
captive
the
next
day
they
killed
her
because
she
could
not
ride
on
horseback
and
keep
up
with
them
within
a
short
time
two
more
small
had
left
the
band
attacked
trains
and
killed
two
men
two
women
and
a
child
the
chiefs
at
first
could
not
restrain
them
but
in
september
they
sent
a
delegation
to
the
agency
to
ask
their
assistance
and
advice
they
said
that
the
was
now
completely
under
their
control
and
they
wished
to
know
what
they
could
do
they
implored
the
great
father
not
to
be
angry
with
them
for
they
could
not
control
the
when
they
saw
their
friends
killed
by
soldiers
after
they
had
thrown
down
their
bows
and
arrows
and
begged
for
life
in
october
the
agent
reported
that
the
cheyennes
were
perfectly
quiet
and
peaceable
and
entirely
within
control
and
obedient
to
authority
the
chiefs
had
organized
a
sort
of
police
whose
duty
was
to
kill
any
that
might
attempt
to
leave
the
camp
through
the
winter
the
cheyennes
remained
in
the
south
and
parts
of
the
agency
and
strictly
observed
the
conditions
which
their
agent
had
imposed
upon
them
in
the
following
august
however
a
military
force
under
general
sumner
was
sent
out
to
demand
from
the
tribe
the
perpetrators
of
their
late
outrages
on
the
whites
and
ample
security
for
their
good
conduct
the
cheyennes
were
reported
by
general
sumner
as
showing
no
disposition
to
yield
to
these
demands
he
therefore
attacked
them
burnt
their
village
to
the
ground
and
destroyed
their
winter
fifteen
or
twenty
thousand
pounds
of
buffalo
meat
of
how
they
lived
and
where
during
the
winter
following
this
fight
there
is
little
record
in
the
next
year
reports
the
cheyennes
are
said
to
be
very
anxious
for
a
new
treaty
which
will
assign
to
them
a
country
in
which
they
can
dwell
safely
they
said
they
had
learned
a
lesson
last
summer
in
their
fight
with
general
it
was
useless
to
contend
with
the
white
man
who
would
soon
with
his
villages
occupy
the
whole
prairie
they
wanted
peace
and
as
the
principal
dependence
for
food
and
clothing
which
even
now
they
were
compelled
to
seek
many
miles
from
home
where
their
natural
enemies
the
pawnee
and
osage
roamed
would
soon
disappear
entirely
they
hoped
their
great
father
the
white
chief
at
washington
would
listen
to
them
and
give
them
a
home
where
they
might
be
provided
for
and
protected
against
the
encroachments
of
their
white
brothers
until
at
least
they
had
been
taught
to
cultivate
the
soil
and
other
arts
of
civilized
life
they
have
often
desired
ploughs
and
hoes
and
to
be
taught
their
use
the
next
year
records
show
the
government
itself
aware
that
some
measures
must
be
taken
to
provide
for
these
troublesome
wild
tribes
of
the
prairie
almost
more
perplexing
in
time
of
peace
than
in
time
of
war
is
the
problem
of
the
disposition
to
be
made
of
them
agents
and
superintendents
alike
are
pressing
on
the
government
attention
the
facts
and
the
bearing
of
the
rapid
settling
of
the
indian
lands
by
the
whites
the
precariousness
of
peaceful
relations
the
dangers
of
indian
wars
the
indians
themselves
are
deeply
anxious
and
disturbed
they
have
heard
that
all
of
the
indian
tribes
to
the
eastward
of
them
have
ceded
their
lands
to
the
united
states
except
small
reservations
and
hence
by
an
indian
reasoning
in
a
few
years
these
tribes
will
emigrate
farther
west
and
as
a
matter
of
necessity
occupy
the
of
the
wild
tribes
when
the
agent
of
the
upper
platte
agency
tried
to
reason
on
this
subject
with
one
of
the
sioux
chiefs
the
chief
said
when
i
was
a
young
man
and
i
am
not
yet
fifty
i
travelled
with
my
people
through
the
country
of
the
sac
and
fox
tribe
to
the
great
water
minne
toukah
mississippi
where
i
saw
corn
growing
but
no
white
people
continuing
eastward
we
came
to
the
rock
river
valley
and
saw
the
winnebagoes
but
no
white
people
we
then
came
to
the
fox
river
valley
and
thence
to
the
great
lake
lake
michigan
where
we
found
a
few
white
people
in
the
pottawattomie
country
thence
we
returned
to
the
sioux
country
at
the
great
falls
of
irara
anthony
and
had
a
feast
of
green
corn
with
our
relations
who
resided
there
afterward
we
visited
the
quarry
in
the
country
of
the
yankton
sioux
and
made
a
feast
to
the
medicine
and
danced
the
dance
and
then
returned
to
our
on
the
prairie
and
now
our
father
tells
us
the
white
man
will
never
settle
on
our
lands
and
kill
our
game
but
see
the
whites
cover
all
of
those
lands
i
have
just
described
and
also
the
lands
of
the
poncas
omahas
and
pawnees
on
the
south
platte
the
white
people
are
finding
gold
and
the
cheyennes
and
arapahoes
have
no
longer
any
our
country
has
become
very
small
and
before
our
children
are
grown
up
we
shall
have
no
game
in
the
autumn
of
this
year
an
agent
was
sent
to
hold
a
council
with
the
cheyennes
and
arapahoes
and
tell
them
of
the
wish
of
the
government
that
they
should
assume
a
fixed
residence
and
occupy
themselves
in
agriculture
this
they
at
once
received
with
favor
and
declared
with
great
unanimity
to
be
acceptable
to
them
they
expected
and
asked
that
the
department
shall
supply
them
with
what
is
necessary
to
establish
themselves
permanently
both
these
tribes
had
scrupulously
maintained
peaceful
relations
with
the
whites
and
with
other
indian
tribes
notwithstanding
the
many
causes
of
irritation
growing
out
of
the
occupation
of
the
gold
region
and
the
emigration
to
it
through
their
which
are
no
longer
reliable
as
a
certain
source
of
food
to
them
it
was
estimated
that
during
the
summer
of
over
sixty
thousand
emigrants
crossed
these
plains
in
their
central
belt
the
trains
of
vehicles
and
cattle
were
frequent
and
valuable
in
proportion
and
post
lines
and
private
expresses
were
in
constant
motion
in
a
commissioner
was
sent
out
to
hold
a
council
with
the
cheyennes
and
arapahoes
at
bent
fort
on
the
upper
arkansas
and
make
a
treaty
with
them
the
arapahoes
were
fully
represented
but
there
were
present
only
two
prominent
chiefs
of
the
kettle
and
white
antelope
white
antelope
was
one
of
the
chiefs
brutally
murdered
five
years
later
in
the
chivington
massacre
in
colorado
as
it
was
impossible
for
the
rest
of
the
cheyennes
to
reach
the
fort
in
less
than
twenty
days
and
the
commissioner
could
not
wait
so
long
black
kettle
and
white
antelope
wished
it
to
be
distinctly
understood
that
they
pledged
only
themselves
and
their
own
bands
the
commissioner
says
i
informed
them
as
to
the
object
of
my
visit
and
gave
them
to
understand
that
their
great
father
had
heard
with
delight
of
their
peaceful
disposition
although
they
were
almost
in
the
midst
of
the
hostile
tribes
they
expressed
great
pleasure
on
learning
that
their
great
father
had
heard
of
their
good
conduct
and
requested
me
to
say
in
return
that
they
intended
in
every
respect
to
conform
to
the
wishes
of
the
government
i
then
presented
to
them
a
diagram
of
the
country
assigned
them
by
their
treaty
of
as
their
which
they
seemed
to
understand
perfectly
and
were
enabled
without
difficulty
to
give
each
initial
point
in
fact
they
exhibited
a
degree
of
intelligence
seldom
to
be
found
among
tribes
where
no
effort
has
been
made
to
civilize
them
i
stated
to
them
that
it
was
the
intention
of
their
great
father
to
reduce
the
area
of
their
present
reservation
and
that
they
should
settle
down
and
betake
themselves
to
agriculture
and
eventually
abandon
the
chase
as
a
means
of
support
they
informed
me
that
such
was
their
wish
and
that
they
had
been
aware
for
some
time
that
they
would
be
compelled
to
do
so
that
game
was
growing
more
scarce
every
year
and
that
they
had
also
noticed
the
approach
of
whites
and
felt
that
they
must
soon
in
a
great
measure
conform
to
their
habits
it
has
not
fallen
to
my
lot
to
visit
any
indians
who
seem
more
disposed
to
yield
to
the
wishes
of
the
government
than
the
cheyennes
and
arapahoes
notwithstanding
they
are
fully
aware
of
the
rich
mines
discovered
in
their
country
they
are
disposed
to
yield
up
their
claims
without
any
reluctance
they
certainly
deserve
the
fostering
hand
of
the
government
and
should
be
liberally
encouraged
in
their
new
sphere
of
life
this
treaty
was
concluded
in
february
of
the
next
year
at
fort
wise
the
chiefs
of
the
cheyennes
and
arapahoes
there
ceded
and
relinquished
all
the
lands
to
which
they
had
any
claim
wherever
situated
except
a
certain
tract
whose
boundaries
were
defined
the
land
relinquished
included
lands
in
kansas
and
nebraska
and
all
of
that
part
of
colorado
which
is
north
of
the
arkansas
and
east
of
the
rocky
mountains
the
cheyennes
and
arapahoes
in
consideration
of
their
kind
treatment
by
the
citizens
of
denver
and
the
adjoining
towns
respectfully
requested
in
the
eleventh
article
of
this
treaty
that
the
united
states
would
permit
the
proprietors
of
these
towns
to
enter
their
lands
at
the
minimum
price
of
one
dollar
and
cents
an
acre
this
article
was
struck
out
by
the
senate
and
the
indians
consented
to
the
amendment
but
the
proof
of
their
and
gratitude
remained
on
record
nevertheless
the
desire
of
the
government
to
make
farmers
of
these
indians
was
reiterated
in
this
treaty
and
evidenced
by
pledges
of
purchase
of
stock
agricultural
implements
etc
mills
also
and
mechanic
shops
they
were
to
have
and
an
annuity
of
a
year
for
fifteen
years
there
was
this
clause
however
in
an
article
of
the
treaty
their
annuities
may
at
the
discretion
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
be
discontinued
entirely
should
said
indians
fail
to
make
reasonable
and
satisfactory
efforts
to
improve
and
advance
their
condition
in
which
case
such
other
provision
shall
be
made
for
them
as
the
president
and
congress
may
judge
to
be
suitable
or
proper
could
there
be
a
more
complete
signing
away
than
this
of
all
benefits
provided
for
by
the
treaty
lands
were
to
be
assigned
to
them
in
severalty
and
certificates
were
to
be
issued
by
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
specifying
the
names
of
individuals
and
that
the
said
tracts
were
set
apart
for
the
exclusive
use
and
benefit
of
the
assignees
and
their
heirs
each
indian
was
to
have
forty
acres
of
land
to
include
in
every
case
as
far
as
practicable
a
reasonable
portion
of
timber
and
water
the
tenth
article
of
the
treaty
provided
that
the
annuities
now
paid
to
the
arapahoes
and
cheyennes
should
be
continued
to
them
until
the
stipulations
of
such
treaties
or
articles
of
agreement
should
be
fulfilled
and
the
seventh
article
provided
that
the
president
with
the
assent
of
congress
should
have
power
to
modify
or
change
any
of
the
provisions
of
former
treaties
in
such
manner
and
to
whatever
extent
he
might
judge
it
to
be
necessary
and
expedient
for
their
best
interests
could
a
community
of
people
be
delivered
up
more
completely
bound
and
at
the
mercy
of
a
government
some
of
the
bands
of
the
cheyennes
who
were
not
represented
at
this
council
were
much
dissatisfied
with
the
treaty
as
evidently
they
had
great
reason
to
be
and
as
time
went
on
all
the
bands
became
dissatisfied
two
years
later
we
find
that
instead
of
their
being
settled
on
those
farms
in
severalty
the
survey
of
their
lands
has
been
just
completed
and
that
a
contract
will
soon
be
made
for
the
construction
of
a
ditch
for
the
purpose
of
irrigating
their
arable
land
it
is
to
be
hoped
the
superintendent
of
the
colorado
agency
writes
that
when
suitable
preparations
for
their
subsistence
by
agriculture
and
grazing
are
made
these
tribes
will
gradually
cease
their
roaming
and
become
permanently
settled
it
would
seem
highly
probable
that
under
those
conditions
the
creatures
would
be
only
too
glad
to
cease
to
roam
it
is
now
ten
years
since
they
were
reported
to
be
in
a
condition
of
miserable
starvation
every
winter
trying
to
raise
a
little
corn
here
and
there
and
begging
to
have
a
farmer
and
a
blacksmith
sent
out
to
them
they
are
now
divided
and
subdivided

the
governor
of
colorado
says
in
his
report
for
that
these
extensive
subdivisions
of
the
tribes
caused
great
difficulty
in
ascertaining
the
really
guilty
parties
in
the
commission
of
offences
depredations
and
hostilities
are
being
frequently
committed
but
it
is
manifestly
unjust
to
hold
the
whole
tribe
responsible
for
the
acts
of
a
few
things
grew
rapidly
worse
in
colorado
those
preparations
for
their
subsistence
by
agriculture
and
grazing
it
took
so
much
room
to
tell
in
the

been
made
the

the
blacksmith
and
the
not
having

not
having

no

can
raise
any
crops
in

even

the

and
arapahoes
took
to
a
system
of
pilfering
reprisals
from
emigrant
trains
and
in
the
fights
resulting
from
this
effort
to
steal
they
committed
many
terrible
murders
all
the
tribes
on
the
plains
were
more
or
less
engaged
in
these
outrages
and
it
was
evident
before
midsummer
of
that
the
government
must
interfere
with
a
strong
hand
to
protect
the
emigrants
and
western
protect
them
from
the
consequences
of
its
own
bad
faith
with
the
indians
the
governor
of
colorado
called
for
military
aid
and
for
authority
to
make
a
campaign
against
the
indians
which
was
given
him
but
as
there
was
no
doubt
that
many
of
the
indians
were
still
peaceable
and
loyal
and
he
desired
to
avoid
every
possibility
of
their
sharing
in
the
punishment
of
the
guilty
he
issued
a
proclamation
in
june
requesting
all
who
were
friendly
to
come
to
places
which
he
designated
where
they
were
to
be
assured
of
safety
and
protection
this
proclamation
was
sent
to
all
the
indians
of
the
plains
in
consequence
of
it
several
bands
of
friendly
arapahoes
and
cheyennes
came
to
fort
lyon
and
were
there
received
by
the
officer
in
charge
rationed
and
assured
of
safety
here
there
occurred
on
the
of
november
one
of
the
foulest
massacres
which
the
world
has
seen
this
camp
of
friendly
indians
was
surprised
at
daybreak
and
men
women
and
children
were
butchered
in
cold
blood
most
of
those
who
escaped
fled
to
the
north
and
joining
other
bands
of
the
tribe
proceeded
at
once
to
take
most
fearful
and
it
must
be
said
natural
revenge
a
terrible
war
followed
some
of
them
confederated
with
the
sioux
and
waged
relentless
war
on
all
the
emigrant
routes
across
the
plains
these
hostilities
were
bitter
in
proportion
to
the
bitterness
of
resentment
felt
by
the
refugees
from
this
massacre
it
will
be
long
before
faith
in
the
honor
and
humanity
of
the
whites
can
be
in
the
minds
of
these
barbarians
says
an
official
report
and
the
last

who
escaped

to
which
they
probably
could
never
have

restored
to
the
public

of
that
territory
and
they
hoped
in
their
new
home
for
greater
safety
and
peace
the
apaches
who
had
heretofore
been
allied
with
the
kiowas
and

were
now
allied
with
them
and
to
have
the
benefits
of
the
new
treaty
a
small
portion
of
the
young
men
of

turbulent
held
aloof
and
refused
to
come
under
the
treaty
provisions
one
riotous
band
called
the

soldiers
were
especially
refractory
but
before
the
end
of
the
next
year
they
also
decided
to
go
southward
and
join
the
rest
of
the
tribe
on
the
new
reservation
occasional
hostilities
took
place
in
the
course
of
the
winter
one
of
which
it
is
worth
while
to
relate
the
incident
is
so
typical
a
one
on
the
of
february
a
son
of
one
boggs
was
killed
and
scalped
by
a
party
of
four
cheyenne
indians
about
six
miles
east
of
fort
dodge
on
the
arkansas
river
on
investigation
it
appeared
that
boggs
had
gone
to
the
indian
camp
without
any
authority
and
had
there
traded
off
eleven
bills
for
bills
the
indian
on
whom
this
trick
had
been
played
found
boggs
out
went
to
him
and
demanded
reparation
and
in
the
altercation
and
fight
which
ensued
son
was
killed
this
story
is
given
in
the
official
report
of
gordon
and
colonel
gordon
adds
i
think
this
case
needs
no
further
comment
the
cheyennes
did
not
long
remain
at
peace
in
the
summer
the
senate
had
added
to
this
last
treaty
an
amendment
requiring
their
new
reservation
to
be
entirely
outside
the
state
of
kansas
and
not
within
any
indian
territory
except
on
consent
of
the
tribes
interested
as
the
reservation
had
been
partly
in
kansas
and
partly
on
the
lands
of
the
cherokees
this
amendment
left
them
literally
without
any
home
whatever
under
these
circumstances
the
young
men
of
the
tribe
soon
began
to
join
again
with
other
hostile
indians
in
committing
depredations
and
hostilities
along
the
great
on
the
plains
again
they
were
visited
with
summary
and
apparently
deserved
vengeance
by
the
united
states
troops
and
in
the
summer
of
a
cheyenne
village
numbering
three
hundred
lodges
was
burnt
by
united
states
soldiers
under
general
hancock
fortunately
the
women
and
children
had
all
fled
on
the
first
news
of
the
approach
of
the
army
soon
after
this
another
council
was
held
with
them
and
once
more
the
precarious
peace
was
confirmed
by
treaty
but
was
almost
immediately
broken
again
in
consequence
of
the
failure
of
the
government
to
comply
with
the
treaty
provisions
that
some
members
of
these
tribes
had
also
failed
to
keep
to
the
treaty
provisions
is
undoubtedly
true
but
by
far
the
greater
part
of
them
were
loyal
and
peaceable
the
substantial
cause
of
this
war
however
was
acknowledged
by
the
indian
bureau
itself
to
be
the
fact
that
the
department
for
want
of
appropriations
was
compelled
to
stop
their
supplies
and
to
permit
them
to
recur
to
the
chase
for
subsistence
in
the
country
bounded
east
by
the
state
of
arkansas
south
by
texas
north
by
kansas
and
west
by
the
hundredth
meridian
of
longitude
was
set
apart
for
the
exclusive
use
of
the
cheyennes
arapahoes
kiowas
and
comanches
and
such
other
bands
as
might
be
located
there
by
proper
authority
and
the
whole
was
declared
to
constitute
a
military
district
under
command
of
hazen
in
october
of
the
same
year
major
wynkoop
who
had
been
the
faithful
friend
of
the
cheyennes
and
arapahoes
ever
since
the
days
of
sand
creek
published
his
last
protest
in
their
behalf
in
a
letter
to
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
he
says
that
the
failure
of
the
government
to
fulfil
treaty
provisions
in
the
matter
of
supplies
forced
them
to
resort
to
hunting
again
and
then
the
refusal
of
the
government
to
give
them
the
arms
and
ammunition
promised
in
the
treaty
left
them
without
any
means
of
securing
the
game
hence
the
depredations
the
chiefs
had
promised
to
deliver
up
the
guilty
ones
to
major
wynkoop
but
before
sufficient
time
had
elapsed
for
them
to
fulfil
their
promises
the
troops
were
in
the
field
and
the
indians
in
flight
even
after
the
majority
of
the
cheyennes
had
been
forced
to
take
the
in
consequence
of
the
bad
acts
of
some
of
their
nation

bands
of

cheyennes

arapahoe
tribe
could
have
been
kept
at
peace

proper
action
been
taken
at
the
time

now
all
the
indians
of
the
upper
arkansas
are
engaged
in
the
struggle

disposed
to
observe
the

were
earnestly

to
be

farther
to
the
north
where
they
might
hunt

very
strong
inducements
have
been
made
by
the
raiding
bands
of
kiowas
at
critical
times
in
the
past
two
years
to
join
them
in
hostile
alliance
in
raids
against
the
whites
but
all
such
appeals
have
been
rejected
and
as
a

they
have
remained
loyal

peaceful
thirty
lodges
of
the
northern
cheyennes
returned
this
year
and
joined
their
tribe
but
many
of
them
were
still
roaming

said
to
be
over
three
thousand
of
these
northern
cheyennes
and
arapahoes
at
the
red

agency
the
government
refused
any
longer
to
permit
them
to
stay
there
and
after
repeated
protests
and
expressions
of
unwillingness
to
move
they
at
last
consented
to
go
to
the
indian
territory
but
their
removal
was
deferred
on
account
of
the
unsettled
state
of
the

had
broken
out
among

this
was
sufficient
to
bring
on
a
general
war
against
white

in
the
whole

the
history

a

took
refuge

the
old
problem
returned
again
how
to
punish
the
guilty
without
harming
the
innocent
a
vigorous
military
campaign
was
carried
on
under

wretched
half

more
pitiable
sight
was
never
seen
than
this
band
of
indians
it
was
inconceivable
how
they
had
so
long
held
out
nothing
but
a
indomitable
pride
and
inextinguishable
hatred
of
the
whites
and
sense
of
wrongs
could
have
supported
them
it
was
decided
that
of
the
most
desperate
ones
should
be
sent
as
prisoners
to
augustine
florida
but
before
the
selection
was
completed
a
general
stampede
among
the
surrendered
braves
took
place

in
the
final
escape
of
some
four
hundred

held
their
ground
from

until
dark
against
three
companies
of

guns
and
under
cover
of
an
extremely
dark
and
stormy
night
escaped

of
the
condition
of
affairs
at

severest
test

comparing
their
own
condition
with
that
of

the
northern
cheyennes
who
have
visited
the

submit
to
a
count
in

of
the
hostilities
they
were
obliged
to
remain
close

in
hardship
that
could
hardly
be

and
resulted
in
serious
suffering
their
rations
were
not
enough
to

being
cut
off
from

reported
as
so
anxious
to
cultivate
the
ground
that
when
they
could
not
secure
the
use
of
a
plough
or
hoe
they
used
axes
sticks
of
wood
and
their
hands
in
preparing
the
ground
planting
and
cultivating
their
garden
spots
the
northern
cheyennes
are
still
on
the
red
cloud
agency
and
are
reported
as
restless
and
troublesome
in
they
were
all
removed
to
the
cheyenne
and
arapahoe
agency
in
indian
territory
the
reports
of
the
department
say
that
they
asked
to
be
taken
there
the
winter
of
and
the
summer
of
were
seasons
of
great
activity
and
interest
at
this
agency
in
the
autumn
they
went
off
on
a
grand
buffalo
hunt
accompanied
by
a
small
detail
of
troops
from
fort
reno
early
in
the
winter
white
began
to
make
raids
on
their
ponies
and
stole
so
many
that
many
of
the
indians
were
obliged
to
depend
on
their
friends
ponies
to
help
them
return
home
two
hundred
and
sixty
in
all
were
as
usual
to
dodge
city
and
sold
a
few
were
recovered
but
the
loss
to
the
indians
was
estimated
at
two
thousand
nine
hundred
dollars
such
losses
are
very
discouraging
to
the
indians
writes
their
agent
and
are
but
a
repetition
of
the
old
story
that
brought
on
the
war
of
in
midsummer
of
this
year
the
cheyenne
and
arapahoe
transportation
company
was
formed
forty
wagons
were
sent
out
with
harness
by
the
government
the
indians
furnished
the
horses
and
on
the
of
july
the
indians
set
out
in
their
new
of
freighters
of
their
own
supplies
they
went
to
wichita
hundred
and
six
days
with
their
ponies
loaded
thousand
pounds
of
supplies
into
the
wagons
and
made
the
return
trip
in
two
weeks
all
things
being
delivered
in
good
condition
this
experiment
was
thoroughly
tested
and
its
results
are
notable
among
the
many
unheeded
refutations
of
the
constantly
repeated
assertion
that
indians
will
not
work
the
agent
of
the
cheyennes
and
the
arapahoes
testifying
before
a
senate
committee
in
says
we
have
run
a
wagon
train
driven
by
indians
to
wichita
for
three
years
and
over
and
have
never
had
a
drunken
indian
yet
do
they
waste
their
money
or
bring
it
home
they
almost
invariably
spend
it
for
saddles
or
clothing
or
something
of
use
to
them
that
is
not
furnished
by
the
government
they
have
never
stolen
an
ounce
of
sugar
coffee
or
anything
else
they
have
been
careful
not
to
injure
or
waste
anything
and
have
delivered
everything
in
good
faith
the
agent
reports
not
a
single
case
of
drunkenness
during
the
year
the
manual
labor
and
has
one
hundred
and
thirteen
scholars
in
it
all
it
can
accommodate
the
children
earned
four
hundred
dollars
in
the
year
by
work
of
one
sort
and
another
and
have
expended
the
money
as
judiciously
as
would
white
children
of
their
ages
they
bought
calico
cotton
cloth
shoes
hats
several
head
of
cattle
and
one
horse
they
also
bought
many
delicacies
for
their
friends
in
camp
who
were
sick
and
in
need
one
cheyenne
woman
tanned
robes
traded
them
for
heifers
and
gave
them
to
her
daughter
in
the
school
the
boys
have
one
hundred
and
twenty
acres
of
corn
under
cultivation
ten
acres
of
potatoes
peanuts
melons
and
a
good
variety
of
vegetables
they
are
entitled
to
the
crop
for
cultivating
it
this
is
a
marvellous
report
of
the
change
wrought
in
a
people
in
only
two
years
time
it
proves
that
the
misdemeanors
the
hostilities
of
and
had
been
largely
forced
on
them
by
circumstances
the
winter
of
and
summer
of
were
terrible
seasons
for
the
cheyennes
their
fall
hunt
had
proved
unsuccessful
indians
from
other
reservations
had
hunted
the
ground
over
before
them
and
driven
the
buffalo
off
and
the
cheyennes
made
their
way
home
again
in
straggling
parties
destitute
and
hungry
their
agent
reports
that
the
result
of
this
hunt
has
clearly
proved
that
in
the
future
the
indian
must
rely
on
tilling
the
ground
as
the
principal
means
of
support
and
if
this
conviction
can
be
firmly
established
the
greatest
obstacle
to
advancement
in
agriculture
will
be
overcome
with
the
buffalo
gone
and
their
pony
herds
being
constantly
decimated
by
the
inroads
of
they
must
soon
adopt
in
all
its
varieties
the
way
of
the
white
man
the
usual
amount
of
has
prevailed
and
the
few
cases
of
successful
pursuit
have
only
increased
the
boldness
of
the
thieves
and
the
number
of
the
thefts
until
some
other
system
of
law
is
introduced
we
can
not
hope
for
a
cessation
of
this
grievance
the
ration
allowed
to
these
indians
is
reported
as
being
reduced
and
insufficient
and
the
small
sums
they
have
been
able
to
earn
by
selling
are
said
to
have
been
of
material
assistance
to
them
in
supplementing
this
ration
but
in
this
year
there
have
been
sold
only
worth
of
skins
by
the
cheyennes
and
arapahoes
together
in
they
sold
worth
here
is
a
falling
off
enough
to
cause
very
great
suffering
in
a
little
community
of
five
thousand
people
but
this
was
only
the
beginning
of
their
troubles
the
summer
proved
one
of
unusual
heat
extreme
heat
chills
and
fever
and
a
reduced
and
insufficient
ration
all
combined
resulted
in
an
amount
of
sickness
to
read
of
it
is
no
exaggerated
estimate
says
the
agent
to
place
the
number
of
sick
people
on
the
reservation
at
two
thousand
many
deaths
occurred
which
might
have
been
obviated
had
there
been
a
proper
supply
of
remedies
at
hand
hundreds
applying
for
treatment
have
been
refused
medicine
the
northern
cheyennes
grew
more
and
more
restless
and
unhappy
in
council
and
elsewhere
they
profess
an
intense
desire
to
be
sent
north
where
they
say
they
will
settle
down
as
the
others
have
done
says
the
report
adding
with
an
obtuseness
which
is
inexplicable
that
no
difference
has
been
made
in
the
treatment
of
the
indians
but
that
the
compliance
of
these
northern
cheyennes
has
been
of
an
entirely
different
nature
from
that
of
the
other
indians
and
that
it
may
be
necessary
in
the
future
to
compel
what
so
far
we
have
been
unable
to
effect
by
kindness
and
appeal
to
their
better
natures
if
it
is
an
appeal
to
men
better
natures
to
remove
them
by
force
from
a
healthful
northern
climate
which
they
love
and
thrive
in
to
a
malarial
southern
one
where
they
are
struck
down
by
chills
and
them
medicine
which
can
combat
chills
and
fever
and
finally
starve
indeed
might
be
said
to
have
been
most
forcible
appeals
made
to
the
better
natures
of
these
northern
cheyennes
what
might
have
been
predicted
followed
early
in
the
autumn
after
this
terrible
summer
a
band
of
some
three
hundred
of
these
northern
cheyennes
took
the
desperate
step
of
running
off
and
attempting
to
make
their
way
back
to
dakota
they
were
pursued
fought
desperately
but
were
finally
overpowered
and
surrendered
they
surrendered
however
only
on
the
condition
that
they
should
be
taken
to
dakota
they
were
unanimous
in
declaring
that
they
would
rather
die
than
go
back
to
the
indian
territory
this
was
nothing
more
in
fact
than
saying
that
they
would
rather
die
by
bullets
than
of
chills
and
fever
and
starvation
these
indians
were
taken
to
fort
robinson
nebraska
here
they
were
confined
as
prisoners
of
war
and
held
subject
to
the
orders
of
the
department
of
the
interior
the
department
was
informed
of
the
determination
never
to
be
taken
back
alive
to
indian
territory
the
army
officers
in
charge
reiterated
these
statements
and
implored
the
department
to
permit
them
to
remain
at
the
north
but
it
was
of
no
avail
orders
repeated
finally
on
the
return
of
these
indians
to
their
agency
the
commanding
officer
at
fort
robinson
has
been
censured
severely
for
the
course
he
pursued
in
his
effort
to
carry
out
those
orders
it
is
difficult
to
see
what
else
he
could
have
done
except
to
have
resigned
his
post
he
could
not
take
three
hundred
indians
by
sheer
brute
force
and
carry
them
hundreds
of
miles
especially
when
they
were
so
desperate
that
they
had
broken
up
the
iron
stoves
in
their
quarters
and
wrought
and
twisted
them
into
weapons
with
which
to
resist
he
thought
perhaps
he
could
starve
them
into
submission
he
stopped
the
issue
of
food
he
also
stopped
the
issue
of
fuel
to
them
it
was
midwinter
the
mercury
froze
in
that
month
at
fort
robinson
at
the
end
of
two
days
he
asked
the
indians
to
let
their
women
and
children
come
out
that
he
might
feed
them
not
a
woman
would
come
out
on
the
night
of
the
fourth
according
to
some
accounts
the
starving
freezing
indians
broke
prison
overpowered
the
guards
and
fled
carrying
their
women
and
children
with
them
they
held
the
pursuing
troops
at
bay
for
several
days
finally
made
a
last
stand
in
a
deep
ravine
and
were
shot
women
and
children
together
out
of
the
whole
band
there
were
left
alive
some
fifty
women
and
children
and
seven
men
who
having
been
confined
in
another
part
of
the
fort
had
not
had
the
good
fortune
to
share
in
this
outbreak
and
meet
their
death
in
the
ravine
these
with
their
wives
and
children
were
sent
to
fort
leavenworth
to
be
put
in
prison
the
men
to
be
tried
for
murders
committed
in
their
skirmishes
in
kansas
on
their
way
to
the
north
red
cloud
a
sioux
chief
came
to
fort
robinson
immediately
after
this
massacre
and
entreated
to
be
allowed
to
take
the
cheyenne
widows
and
orphans
into
his
tribe
to
be
cared
for
the
government
therefore
kindly
permitted
cheyenne
widows
and
cheyenne
of
them
be
received
into
the
band

ogallalla
sioux
an
attempt
was
made
by
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
in
his
report
for
to
show
by
tables
and
figures
that
these
indians
were
not
starving
at
the
time
of
their
flight
from
indian
territory
the
attempt
only
redounded
to
his
own
disgrace
it
being
proved
by
the
testimony
given
by
a
former
clerk
of
the
indian
bureau
before
the
senate
committee
appointed
to
investigate
the
case
of
the
northern
cheyennes
that
the
commissioner
had
been
guilty
of
absolute
dishonesty
in
his
estimates
and
that
the
quantity
of
beef
actually
issued
to
the
cheyenne
agency
was
hundreds
of
pounds
less
than
he
had
reported
it
and
that
the
indians
were
actually
as
they
had
claimed
starving
the
testimony
given
before
this
committee
by
some
of
the
cheyenne
prisoners
themselves
is
one
must
have
a
callous
heart
who
can
read
it
unmoved
when
asked
by
senator
morgan
did
you
ever
really
suffer
from
hunger
one
of
the
chiefs
replied
we
were
hungry
we
had
enough
when
they
that
were
sick
once
in
awhile
felt
as
though
they
could
eat
something
we
had
nothing
to
give
them
did
you
not
go
out
on
the
plains
sometimes
and
hunt
buffalo
with
the
consent
of
the
agent
we
went
out
on
a
and
nearly
starved
while
out
we
could
not
find
any
buffalo
hardly
we
could
hardly
get
back
with
our
ponies
we
had
to
kill
a
good
many
of
our
ponies
to
eat
to
save
ourselves
from
starving
how
many
children
got
sick
and
died
between
the
fall
of
and
we
lost
fifty
children
a
great
many
of
our
finest
young
men
died
as
well
as
many
women
old
crow
a
chief
who
served
faithfully
as
indian
scout
and
ally
under
general
crook
for
years
said
i
did
not
feel
like
doing
anything
for
awhile
because
i
had
no
heart
i
did
not
want
to
be
in
this
country
i
was
all
the
time
wanting
to
get
back
to
the
better
country
where
i
was
born
and
where
my
children
are
buried
and
where
my
mother
and
sister
yet
live
so
i
have
laid
in
my
lodge
most
of
the
time
with
nothing
to
think
about
but
that
and
the
affair
up
north
at
fort
robinson
and
my
relatives
and
friends
who
were
killed
there
but
now
i
feel
as
though
if
i
had
a
wagon
and
a
horse
or
two
and
some
land
i
would
try
to
work
if
i
had
something
so
that
i
could
do
something
i
might
not
think
so
much
about
these
other
things
as
it
is
now
i
feel
as
though
i
would
just
as
soon
be
asleep
with
the
rest
the
wife
of
one
of
the
chiefs
confined
at
fort
leavenworth
testified
before
the
committee
as
follows
the
main
thing
i
complained
of
was
that
we
did
get
enough
to
eat
my
children
nearly
starved
to
death
then
sickness
came
and
there
was
nothing
good
for
them
to
eat
for
a
long
time
the
most
they
had
to
eat
was
and
salt
three
or
four
children
died
every
day
for
awhile
and
that
frightened
us
this
testimony
was
taken
at
fort
reno
in
indian
territory
when
asked
if
there
were
anything
she
would
like
to
say
to
the
committee
the
poor
woman
replied
i
wish
you
would
do
what
you
can
to
get
my
husband
released
i
am
very
poor
here
and
do
not
know
what
is
to
become
of
me
if
he
were
released
he
would
come
down
here
and
we
would
live
together
quietly
and
do
no
harm
to
anybody
and
make
no
trouble
but
i
should
never
get
over
my
desire
to
get
back
north
i
should
always
want
to
get
back
where
my
children
were
born
and
died
and
were
buried
that
country
is
better
than
this
in
every
respect
there
is
plenty
of
good
cool
water
here
the
water
is
not
good
it
is
not
hot
there
nor
so
sickly
are
you
going
where
my
husband
is
can
you
tell
when
he
is
likely
to
be
released
the
senators
were
obliged
to
reply
to
her
that
they
were
not
going
where
her
husband
was
and
they
could
not
tell
when
he
would
be
released
in
view
of
the
accounts
of
the
sickness
and
suffering
of
these
indians
in
and
the
reports
made
in
of
the
industry
and
progress
at
the
cheyenne
and
arapahoe
agency
are
almost
incredible
the
school
children
have
by
their
earnings
bought
one
hundred
head
of
cattle
pounds
of
freight
have
been
transported
by
the
indians
during
the
year
they
have
also
worked
at
making
brick
chopping
wood
making
hay
hauling
wood
and
splitting
and
hauling
rails
and
have
earned
thereby
two
of
the
girls
of
the
school
have
been
promoted
to
the
position
of
assistant
teachers
and
the
united
states
mail
contractor
between
this
agency
and
fort
elliott
in
distance
of
one
hundred
and
operated
almost
exclusively
with
indians
there
has
been
no
report
of
breach
of
trust
on
the
part
of
any
indians
connected
with
this
trust
and
the
contractor
expresses
his
entire
approval
of
their
conduct
it
is
stated
also
that
there
was
not
sufficient
clothing
to
furnish
each
indian
with
a
warm
suit
of
clothing
as
promised
by
the
treaty
and
that
by
reference
to
official
correspondence
the
fact
is
established
that
the
cheyennes
and
arapahoes
are
judged
as
having
no
legal
rights
to
any
lands
having
forfeited
their
treaty
reservation
by
a
failure
to
settle
thereon
and
their
present
reservation
not
having
been
as
yet
confirmed
by
congress
inasmuch
as
the
indians
fully
understood
and
were
assured
that
this
reservation
was
given
to
them
in
lieu
of
their
treaty
reservation
and
have
commenced
farming
in
the
belief
that
there
was
no
uncertainty
about
the
matter
it
is
but
common
justice
that
definite
action
be
had
at
an
early
day
securing
to
them
what
is
their
right
it
would
seem
that
there
could
be
found
nowhere
in
the
melancholy
record
of
the
experiences
of
our
indians
a
more
glaring
instance
of
confused
multiplication
of
injustices
than
this
the
cheyennes
were
pursued
and
slain
for
venturing
to
leave
this
very
reservation
which
it
appears
is
not
their
reservation
at
all
and
they
have
no
legal
right
to
it
are
there
any
words
to
fitly
characterize
such
treatment
as
this
from
a
great
powerful
rich
nation
to
a
handful
of
helpless
people

nez
percés
bounded
on
the
north
south
and
east
by
mountains
and
on
the
west
by
shining
waters
holding
in
its
rocky
passes
the
sources
of
six
great
rivers
bearing
on
its
slopes
and
plains
measureless
forests
of
pine
and

its

gardens
of

bloom
and
fruit
and
of
fertility
oregon
wide
healthful
beautiful
abundant
and
inviting
no
wonder
it
was
coveted
and
fought
for
when
lewis
and
clarke
visited
it
eighty
years
ago
they
found
living
there
many
tribes
of
indians
numbering
in
all
at
the
lowest
estimates
between
twenty
and
thirty
thousand
of
all
these
tribes
the
nez
percés
were
the
richest
noblest
and
most
gentle
to
the
cayuses
one
of
the
most
warlike
of
these
tribes
lewis
and
clarke
presented
an
american
flag
telling
them
it
was
an
emblem
of
peace
the
gay
coloring
and
beauty
of
the
flag
allied
to
this
significance
made
a
deep
impression
on
the
poetic
minds
of
these
savages
they
set
the
flag
up
in
a
beautiful
valley
called
the
grande
fertile
basin
some
miles
in
diameter
surrounded
by
high
walls
of
basaltic
rock
and
watered
by
a
branch
of
the
snake
river
around
this
flag
they
met
their
old
enemies
the
shoshones
and
swore
to
keep
perpetual
peace
with
them
and
the
spot
became
consecrated
to
an
annual
meeting
of
the
sort
of
fair
where
the
cayuse
nez
percé
and
walla
walla
indians
came
every
summer
and
traded
their
roots
skins
elk
and
buffalo
meats
for
salmon
and
horses
with
the
shoshones
it
was
a
beautiful
spot
nearly
circular
luxuriantly
covered
with
grass
the
hill
wall
around
it
thick
grown
with
evergreen
trees
chiefly
larch
the
indians
called
it
karpkarp
which
being
translated
is
balm
of
gilead
the
life
of
these
indians
was
a
peculiar
one
most
of
them
had
several
homes
and
as
they
lived
only
a
part
of
the
year
in
each
were
frequently
spoken
of
by
travellers
as
nomadic
tribes
while
in
fact
they
were
as
wedded
to
their
homes
as
any
civilized
inhabitants
of
the
world
and
their
wanderings
were
as
systematic
as
the
removals
of
wealthy
city
people
from
town
homes
to
country
places
if
a
man
were
rich
enough
and
fond
enough
of
change
to
have
a
winter
house
in
new
york
a
house
for
the
summer
in
newport
and
one
for
autumn
in
the
white
mountains
nobody
would
think
of
calling
him
a
nomad
still
less
if
he
made
these
successive
changes
annually
with
perfect
regularity
owing
to
opportunities
which
were
offered
him
at
regularly
recurring
intervals
in
these
different
places
to
earn
his
living
which
was
the
case
with
the
oregon
indians
as
soon
as
the
snow
disappears
in
the
spring
there
is
in
certain
localities
ready
for
gathering
the
pohpoh
small
bulb
like
an
onion
this
is
succeeded
by
the
spatlam
and
the
spatlam
by
the
cammass
or
ithwa
a
root
like
a
parsnip
which
they
make
into
fine
meal
in
midsummer
come
the
salmon
in
countless
shoals
up
the
rivers
august
is
the
month
for
berries
of
which
they
dry
great
quantities
for
winter
use
in
september
salmon
down
stream
now
exhausted
and
ready
to
die
but
in
sufficiently
good
condition
to
be
dried
for
the
winter
in
october
comes
the
mesani
another
root
of
importance
in
the
indian
larder
after
this
they
must
depend
on
deer
bears
small
game
and
when
all
these
resources
fail
there
is
a
kind
of
lichen
growing
on
the
trees
of
which
they
can
eat
enough
to
keep
themselves
from
starving
though
its
nutritive
qualities
are
very
small
thus
each
season
had
its
duty
and
its
appointed
place
of
abode
and
year
after
year
the
same
month
found
them
in
the
same
spot
in
a
delegation
from
these
oregon
indians
went
to
louis
and
through
catlin
the
artist
made
known
their
object
which
was
to
inquire
for
the
truth
of
a
representation
which
they
said
some
white
men
had
made
among
them
that
our
religion
was
better
than
theirs
and
that
they
would
all
be
lost
if
they
did
not
embrace
it
two
members
of
this
delegation
were
nez
and
or
leggings
and
no
horns
on
his
head
their
portraits
are
to
be
found
in
catlin
american
indians
one
of
these
died
on
his
way
home
but
the
other
journeyed
his
thousands
of
miles
safely
back
and
bore
to
his
tribe
the
news
that
the
report
which
they
had
heard
was
well
founded
and
that
good
and
religious
men
would
soon
come
among
them
to
teach
this
religion
so
that
they
could
all
understand
and
have
the
benefits
of
it
two
years
later
the
methodist
episcopal
society
and
the
american
board
both
sent
missionaries
to
oregon
before
this
the
religion
of
the
was
the
only
white
man
religion
that
the
indians
had
had
the
opportunity
of
observing
eleven
different
companies
and
expeditions
besides
the
hudson
bay
and
the
companies
had
been
established
in
their
country
and
the
indians
had
become
only
too
familiar
with
their
standards
and
methods
it
was
not
many
years
after
the
arrival
of
the
missionaries
in
oregon
that
a
traveller
there
gave
the
following
account
of
his
experience
with
a
nez
percé
guide
creekie
so
he
was
named
was
a
very
kind
man
he
turned
my
animals
loose
and
loaded
my
packs
on
his
own
gave
me
a
splendid
horse
to
ride
and
intimated
by
significant
gestures
that
we
would
go
a
short
distance
that
afternoon
i
gave
my
assent
and
we
were
soon
on
our
way
having
ridden
about
ten
miles
we
camped
for
the
night
i
noticed
during
the
ride
a
degree
of
forbearance
toward
each
other
which
i
had
never
before
observed
in
that
race
when
we
halted
for
the
night
the
two
boys
were
behind
they
had
been
frolicking
with
their
horses
and
as
the
darkness
came
on
lost
the
trail
it
was
a
before
they
made
their
appearance
and
during
this
time
the
parents
manifested
the
most
anxious
solicitude
for
them
one
of
them
was
but
three
years
old
and
was
lashed
to
the
horse
he
rode
the
other
only
seven
years
of
pilots
in
the
wilderness
at
night
but
the
elder
true
to
the
sagacity
of
his
race
had
taken
his
course
and
struck
the
brook
on
which
we
were
encamped
within
three
hundred
yards
of
us
the
pride
of
the
parents
at
this
feat
and
their
ardent
attachment
to
the
children
were
perceptible
in
the
pleasure
with
which
they
received
them
at
their
evening
fire
and
heard
the
relation
of
their
childish
adventures
the
weather
was
so
pleasant
that
no
tent
was
spread
the
willows
were
bent
and
the
spread
over
them
underneath
were
laid
other
robes
on
which
my
indian
host
seated
himself
with
his
wife
and
children
on
one
side
and
myself
on
the
other
a
fire
burnt
brightly
in
front
water
was
brought
and
the
evening
ablutions
having
been
performed
the
wife
presented
a
dish
of
meat
to
her
husband
and
one
to
myself
there
was
a
pause
the
woman
seated
herself
between
her
children
the
indian
then
bowed
his
head
and
prayed
to
god
a
wandering
savage
in
oregon
calling
on
jehovah
in
the
name
of
jesus
christ
after
the
prayer
he
gave
meat
to
his
children
and
passed
the
dish
to
his
wife
while
eating
the
frequent
repetition
of
the
words
jehovah
and
jesus
christ
in
the
most
reverential
manner
led
me
to
suppose
that
they
were
conversing
on
religious
topics
and
thus
they
passed
an
hour
meanwhile
the
exceeding
weariness
of
a
long
day
travel
admonished
me
to
seek
rest
i
had
slumbered
i
know
not
how
long
when
a
strain
of
music
awoke
me
the
indian
family
was
engaged
in
its
evening
devotions
they
were
singing
a
hymn
in
the
nez
percés
language
having
finished
they
all
knelt
and
bowed
their
faces
on
the
and
creekie
prayed
long
and
fervently
afterward
they
sung
another
hymn
and
retired
to
hospitality
family
affection
and
devotion
creekie
added
honesty
and
cleanliness
to
a
great
degree
manifesting
by
these
fruits
so
contrary
to
the
nature
and
habits
of
his
race
the
beautiful
influence
of
the
work
of
grace
on
the
heart
the
earliest
mention
of
the
nez
percés
in
the
official
records
of
the
indian
bureau
is
in
the
year
in
that
year
an
agent
was
sent
out
to
investigate
the
condition
of
the
oregon
tribes
and
he
reports
as
follows
the
only
tribes
from
which
much
is
to
be
hoped
or
anything
to
be
feared
in
this
part
of
oregon
are
the
walla
wallas
cayuses
and
nez
percés
inhabiting
a
district
on
the
columbia
and
its
tributaries
commencing
two
hundred
and
forty
miles
from
its
mouth
and
stretching
four
hundred
and
eighty
miles
in
the
interior
the
nez
percés
living
farther
inland
inhabit
a
beautiful
grazing
district
not
surpassed
by
any
i
have
seen
for
verdure
water
privileges
climate
or
health
this
tribe
forms
an
honorable
exception
to
the
general
indian
more
noble
industrious
sensible
and
better
disposed
toward
the
whites
and
their
improvements
in
the
arts
and
sciences
and
though
brave
as
cæsar
the
whites
have
nothing
to
dread
at
their
hands
in
case
of
their
dealing
out
to
them
what
they
conceive
to
be
right
and
equitable
when
this
agent
arrived
at
the
missionary
station
among
the
nez
percés
he
was
met
there
by
a
large
body
of
the
indians
with
of
their
chiefs
the
missionaries
received
him
with
joyful
countenances
and
glad
hearts
the
indians
with
civility
gravity
and
dignified
reserve
he
addressed
them
at
length
explaining
to
them
the
kind
intentions
of
the
government
toward
them
they
listened
with
gravity
fixed
attention
and
decorum
finally
an
aged
chief
ninety
years
of
age
arose
and
said
i
speak
perhaps
i
die
i
am
the
oldest
chief
of
the
tribe
i
was
the
high
chief
when
your
great
brothers
lewis
and
clarke
visited
this
country
they
visited
me
and
honored
me
with
their
friendship
and
counsel
i
showed
them
my
numerous
wounds
received
in
bloody
battle
with
the
snakes
they
told
me
it
was
not
good
it
was
better
to
be
at
peace
gave
me
a
flag
of
truce
i
held
it
up
high
we
met
and
talked
but
never
fought
again
clarke
pointed
to
this
you
and
this
occasion
we
have
long
waited
in
expectation
sent
three
of
our
sons
to
red
river
school
to
prepare
for
it
two
of
them
sleep
with
their
fathers
the
other
is
here
and
can
be
ears
mouth
and
pen
for
us
i
can
say
no
more
i
am
quickly
tired
my
voice
and
limbs
tremble
i
am
glad
i
live
to
see
you
and
this
day
but
i
shall
soon
be
still
and
quiet
in
death
at
this
council
the
nez

by
his
chiefs
if
a
white
man
break
them
he
shall
be
reported
to
the
agent
and
punished
at
his
instance
these
laws
the
agent
says
he
proposed
one
by
one
leaving
them
as
free
to
reject
as
to
accept
they
were
greatly
pleased
with
all
proposed
but
wished
a
heavier
penalty
to
some
and
suggested
the
which
was
annexed
in
a
history
of
oregon
written
by
one
gray
of
astoria
we
find
this
indian
agent
spoken
of
as
a
notorious
blockhead
methods
of
mention
of
all
persons
toward
whom
he
has
antagonism
or
dislike
are
violent
and
undignified
and
do
not
redound
either
to
his
credit
as
a
writer
or
his
credibility
as
a
witness
but
it
is
impossible
to
avoid
the
impression
that
in
this
instance
he
was
not
far
from
the
truth
surely
one
can
not
read
without
mingled
horror
and
incredulity
this
programme
of
the
offered
as
one
of
the
first
instalments
of
the
united
states
government
kind
intentions
toward
these
indians
one
of
the
first
practical
illustrations
given
them
of
the
kind
of
civilization
the
united
states
government
would
recommend
and
introduce
we
are
not
surprised
to
read
in
another
narrative
of
affairs
in
oregon
a
little
later
that
the
indians
want
pay
for
being
whipped
the
same
as
they
did
for
please
the
the
great
revival
of
some
of
the
influential
men
in
the
tribe
desired
to
know
of
what
benefit
this
was
going
to
be
to
them
they
said
they
were
willing
it
should
continue
provided
they
were
to
receive
shirts
and
pants
and
blankets
as
a
reward
for
being
whipped
they
had
been
whipped
a
good
many
times
and
had
got
nothing
for
it
and
it
had
done
them
no
good
if
this
state
of
things
was
to
continue
it
was
all
good
for
nothing
and
they
would
throw
it
away
the
secretary
of
war
does
not
appear
to
have
seen
this
aspect
of
his
agent
original
efforts
in
the
line
of
jurisprudence
he
says
of
the
report
which
includes
this
astounding
code
merely
that
it
furnishes
some
deeply
interesting
and
curious
details
respecting
certain
of
the
indian
tribes
in
that
remote
part
of
our
territories
and
that
the
conduct
of
the
nez
percés
on
the
occasion
of
this
important
meeting
impresses
one
most
agreeably
a
report
submitted
at
the
same
time
by
the
rev
spaulding
who
had
lived
six
years
as
missionary
among
the
nez
percés
is
much
pleasanter
reading
he
says
that
nearly
all
the
principal
men
and
chiefs
are
members
of
the
school
that
they
are
as
industrious
in
their
schools
as
on
their
farms
they
cultivate
their
lands
with
much
skill
and
to
good
advantage
and
many
more
would
do
so
if
they
had
the
means
about
one
hundred
are
printing
their
own
books
with
the
pen
this
keeps
up
a
deep
interest
as
they
daily
have
new
lessons
to
print
and
what
they
print
must
be
committed
to
memory
as
soon
as
possible
a
good
number
are
now
so
far
advanced
in
reading
and
printing
as
to
render
much
assistance
in
teaching
their
books
are
taken
home
at
night
and
every
lodge
becomes
a
their
lessons
are
scripture
lessons
no
others
except
the
laws
seem
to
interest
them
even
this
missionary
seems
to
have
fallen
under
some
strange
glamour
on
the
subject
of
the
for
he
adds
the
laws
which
you
so
happily
prepared
and
which
were
unanimously
adopted
by
the
people
i
have
printed
in
the
form
of
a
small
a
great
number
of
the
school
now
read
them
fluently
in
the
next
year
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
we
read
that
the
nez
percé
tribe
have
adopted
a
few
simple
and
plain

as
their
code
which
will
teach
them
and
is
the
beginning
of
government
on
their
part
the
secretary
also
thinks
it
very
remarkable
that
there
should
so
soon
be
several
well
supported
well
attended
and
well
conducted
schools
in
oregon
not
at
all
remarkable
considering
that
the
congregationalists
the
methodist
episcopalians
and
the
roman
catholics
have
all
had
missionaries
at
work
there
for
eight
years
in
the
nez
percés
with
the
rest
of
the
oregon
tribes
disappear
from
the
official
records
of
the
indian
bureau
it
will
be
necessary
to
make
some
provision
for
conducting
our
relations
with
the
indian
tribes
west
of
the
rocky
mountains
it
is
said
but
the
whole
subject
having
been
laid
before
congress
it
was
not
deemed
advisable
to
continue
a
service
that
was
circumscribed
in
its
objects
and
originally
designed
to
be
temporary
the
founder
of
the
in
oregon
was
therefore
relieved
from
his
duties
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
his
laws
speedily
fell
into
disuse
the
next
year
all
the
protestant
missions
in
oregon
were
abandoned
in
consequence
of
the
frightful
massacre
by
the
cayuses
of
the
missionary
families
living
among
them
but
the
nez
percés
though
deprived
of
their
teaching
did
not
give
up
the
faith
and
the
practice
they
had
taught
them
six
years
later
general
benjamin
alvord
bore
the
following
testimony
to

in

who
had
passed
the
previous
winter
in

to
the
military
post
at
the
dalles
and
on
being
questioned
as
to
the
manners
and
customs
of
the

he
said
that
he
wintered
with
a

were
appointed
for

service
in
oregon
treaties
were
negotiated
with
some
of
the
tribes
but
they
were
not
ratified
and
in
there
was
in
consequence
a
dissatisfaction
among
all
the
indians
in
the
region
they
have
become
distrustful
of
all
promises
made
them
by
the
united
states
says
the
oregon
superintendent
and
believe
the
design
of
the
government
is
to
defer
doing
anything
for
them
till
they
have
wasted
away
the
settlement
of
the
whites
on
the
tracts
which
they
regarded
as
secured
to
them
by
solemn

the

in

the
greater
part
of
the
nez
percés
country
was
now
within
the
limits
of
washington
territory
only
a
few
bands
remaining
in
oregon
they
were
estimated
to
number
at
least
eighteen
hundred
and
were
said
to
be
a
rich
and
powerful
tribe
owning
many
horses
every
year
they
crossed
the
mountains
to
hunt
buffalo
on
the
plains
of
the
missouri
in
there
was
a
general
outbreak
of
hostilities
on
the
part
of
the
oregon
indians
tribe
after
tribe
even
among
those
who
had
been
considered
friendly
fell
into
the
ranks
of
the
hostiles
and
some
base
acts
of
treachery
were
committed
the
oregon
settlers
menaced
with
danger
on
all
sides
became
naturally
so
excited
and
terrified
that
their
actions
were
hasty
and
they
are
without
discipline
without
order
and
similar
to
madmen
says
one
official
report
every
day
they
run
off
the
horses
and
the
cattle
of
the
friendly
indians
i
will
soon
no
longer
be
able
to
restrain
the
friendly
indians
they
are
indignant
at
conduct
so
unworthy
of
the
whites
who
have
made
so
many
promises
to
respect
and
protect
them
if
they
remain
faithful
friends
i
am
very
sure
if
the
volunteers
are
not
arrested
in
their
brigand
actions
our
indians
will
save
themselves
by
flying
to
the
homes
of
their
relations
the
nez
percés
who
have
promised
them
help
and
then
all
these
indians
of
oregon
would
join
in
the
common
defence
until
they
be
entirely
exterminated
it
is
difficult
to
do
full
justice
to
the
moral
courage
which
is
shown
by
indians
who
remain
friendly
to
whites
under
such
circumstances
as
these
the
traditions
of
their
race
the
powerful
influence
of
public
sentiment
among
their
relatives
and
friends
and
in
addition
terror
for
their
own
combine
in
times
of
such
outbreaks
to
draw
even
the
friendliest
tribes
into
sympathy
and
with
those
who
are
making
war
on
whites
at
this
time
the
hostile
indians
in
oregon
sent
word
to
the
nez
percés
join
us
in
the
war
against
the
whites
or
we
will
wipe
you
out
they
said
we
have
made
the
whites
run
out
of
the
country
and
we
will
now
make
the
friendly
indians
do
the
same
what
can
the
friendly
indians
do
wrote
the
colonel
of
a
company
of
washington
territory
volunteers
they
have
no
ammunition
and
the
whites
will
give
them
none
and
the
hostiles
say
to
them
have
plenty
come
and
join
us
and
save
your
lives
the
nez
percés
are
very
much
alarmed
they
say
have
no
ammunition
to
defend
ourselves
with
if
we
are
attacked
the
oregon
superintendent
writes
to
general
wool
in
command
at
this
time
of
the
department
of
the
pacific
imploring
him
to
send
troops
to
oregon
to
protect
both
friendly
indians
and
white
settlers
and
to
enable
this
department
to
maintain
guarantees
secured
to
these
indians
by
treaty
stipulations
he
says
that
the
friendly
indians
are
willing
to
submit
to
almost
any
sacrifice
to
obtain
peace
but
there
may
be
a
point
beyond
which
they
could
not
be
induced
to
go
without
a
struggle
this
outbreak
terminated
after
some
sharp
fighting
and
about
equal
losses
on
both
sides
in
what
the
oregon
superintendent
calls
a
sort
of
armistice
which
left
the
indians
much
emboldened
with
the
impression
on
their
minds
that
they
have
the
ability
to
contend
successfully
against
the
entire
white
race
moreover
the
of
the
treaties
heretofore
made
to
extinguish
their
title
to
the
lands
necessary
for
the
occupancy
and
use
of
our
citizens
seems
to
have
produced
no
little
disappointment
and
the
continued
extension
of
our
settlements
into
their
territory
without
any
compensation
being
made
to
them
is
a
constant
source
of
dissatisfaction
and
hostile
feeling
it
can
not
be
expected
that
indians
situated
like
those
in
oregon
and
washington
territory
occupying
extensive
sections
of
country
where
from
the
game
and
otherwise
they
derive
a
comfortable
support
will
quietly
and
peaceably
submit
without
any
equivalent
to
be
deprived
of
their
homes
and
possessions
and
to
be
driven
off
to
some
other
locality
where
they
can
not
find
their
usual
means
of
subsistence
such
a
proceeding
is
not
only
contrary
to
our
policy
hitherto
but
is
repugnant
alike
to
the
dictates
of
humanity
and
the
principles
of
natural
justice
the
principle
of
recognizing
and
respecting
the
usufruct
right
of
the
indians
to
the
lands
occupied
by
them
has
not
been
so
strictly
adhered
to
in
the
case
of
the
tribes
in
the
territories
of
oregon
and
washington
when
a
territorial
government
was
first
provided
for
then
embraced
the
present
territory
of
inducements
were
held
out
to
our
people
to
emigrate
and
settle
there
without
the
usual
arrangements
being
made
in
advance
for
the
extinguishment
of
the
title
of
the
indians
who
occupied
and
claimed
the
lands
intruded
upon
ousted
of
their
homes
and
possessions
without
any
compensation
and
deprived
in
most
cases
of
their
accustomed
means
of
support
without
any
arrangement
having
been
made
to
enable
them
to
establish
and
maintain
themselves
in
other
locations
it
is
not
a
matter
of
surprise
that
they
have
committed
many
depredations
upon
our
citizens
and
been
exasperated
to
frequent
acts
of
hostility
as
was
to
be
expected
the
armistice
proved
of
no
avail
and
in
the
unfortunate
territories
had
another
indian
war
on
their
hands
in
this
war
we
find
the
nez
percés
fighting
on
the
side
of
the
united
states
against
the
hostile
indians
one
of
the
detachments
of
united
states
troops
was
saved
from
destruction
only
by
taking
refuge
with
them
nearly
destitute
of
ammunition
and
surrounded
by
hundreds
of
hostile
indians
the
little
company
escaped
by
night
and
after
a
ride
of
ninety
miles
mostly
at
a
gallop
and
without
a
rest
reached
snake
river
where
they
were
met
by
this
friendly
tribe
who
received
them
with
open
arms
succored
the
wounded
men
and
crossed
in
safety
the
whole
command
over
the
difficult
and
dangerous
river
the
officer
in
command
of
the
nez
percé
band
writes
as
follows
in
his
report
to
the
indian
commissioner
allow
me
my
dear
sir
while
this
general
war
is
going
on
to
point
you
to
at
least
a
few
green
spots
where
the
ravages
of
war
do
not
as
yet
extend
and
which
thus
far
are
untainted
and
unaffected
with
a
view
of
so
retaining
them
that
we
may
hereafter
point
to
them
as
oases
in
this
desert
of
war
these
green
spots
are
the
nez
percés
the
and
pend
in
this
connection
i
refer
with
grateful
pride
to
an
act
of
colonel
wright
which
embodies
views
and
motives
which
endorsed
and
carried
out
by
the
government
must
redound
to
his
credit
and
praise
and
be
the
means
of
building
up
at
no
distant
day
a
bold
brave
warlike
and
numerous
people
before
leaving
colonel
wright
assembled
the
nez
percé
people
told
them
his
object
was
to
war
with
and
punish
our
enemies
but
as
this
great
people
were
and
ever
had
been
our
friends
he
wanted
their
friendship
to
be
as
enduring
as
the
mountains
around
which
they
lived
and
in
order
that
no
difference
of
views
or
difficulty
might
arise
that
their
mutual
promises
should
be
recorded
with
this
view
he
there
made
a
treaty
of
friendship
with
them
and
thirty
of
the
bravest
warriors
and
chiefs
at
once
marshalled
themselves
to
accompany
him
against
the
enemy
when
colonel
wright
asked
these
indians
what
they
wanted
their
reply
was
worthy
of
a
noble
ploughs
and
schools
at
this
time
they
had
no
agent
appointed
to
attend
to
their
welfare
they
were
raising
wheat
corn
and
vegetables
with
the
rude
means
at
their
command
and
still
preserved
the
faith
and
many
of
the
practices
taught
them
by
the
missionaries
thirteen
years
before
in
peace
was
again
established
in
oregon
and
the
indians
considered
as
conquered
the
treaties
of
were
ratified
by
the
senate
and
this
fact
went
far
to
restore
tranquillity
in
the
territories
congress
was
implored
by
the
superintendents
to
realize
the
importance
of
making
the
appropriations
for
fulfilling
those
treaty
stipulations
at
the
earliest
practicable
moment
that
it
may
prevent
the
recurrence
of
another
savage
war
necessarily
bloody
and
devastating
to
our
settlements
extended
under
the
authority
and
sanction
of
our
government
with
marvellous
the
superintendents
do
not
enforce
their
appeals
by
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
if
the
treaties
had
been
fulfilled
in
the
outset
all
the
hostilities
of
the
last
four
years
might
probably
have
been
avoided
the
reservation
secured
to
the
nez
percés
was
a
fine
tract
of
country
one
hundred
miles
long
and
sixty
in
watered
timbered
and
of
great
natural
resources
already
the
indians
had
begun
to
practice
irrigation
in
their
fields
had
large
herds
of
horses
and
were
beginning
to
give
attention
to
improving
the
breed
some
of
them
could
read
and
write
their
own
language
and
many
of
them
professed
christianity
and
were
exemplary
in
their
most
remarkable
fact
proving
the
depth
of
the
impression
the
missionary
teachings
must
have
made
the
majority
of
them
wore
the
american
costume
and
showed
their
progress
in
civilization
by
attaching
little
value
to
the
gewgaws
and
trinkets
which
so
generally
captivate
the
savage
in
less
than
two
years
the
peace
of
this
noble
tribe
was
again
invaded
this
time
by
a
deadly
greed
of
gold
in
there
were
said
to
be
no
less
than
ten
thousand
miners
in
the
nez
percé
country
prospecting
for
gold
now
arose
the
question
what
will
the
government
do
will
it
protect
the
rights
of
the
indians
or
not
to
attempt
to
restrain
miners
would
be
like
attempting
to
restrain
the
whirlwind
writes
the
superintendent
of
washington
territory
and
he
confesses
that
seeing
the
utter
impossibility
of
preventing
miners
from
going
to
the
mines
he
has
refrained
from
taking
any
steps
which
by
a
certain
want
of
success
would
tend
to
weaken
the
force
of
the
law
for
the
next
few
years
the
nez
percés
saw
with
dismay
the
steady
stream
of
settlers
pouring
into
their
country
that
they
did
not
resist
it
by
force
is
marvellous
and
can
only
be
explained
by
the
power
of
a
truly
christian
spirit
their
reservation
was
overrun
by
the
enterprising
miners
treaty
stipulations
were
disregarded
and
trampled
under
foot
towns
were
established
thereon
and
all
the
means
that
cupidity
could
invent
or
disloyalty
achieve
were
resorted
to
to
shake
their
confidence
in
the
government
they
were
disturbed
in
the
peaceable
possession
of
what
they
regarded
as
their
vested
rights
sacredly
secured
by
treaty
they
were
informed
that
the
government
was
destroyed
and
that
whatever
treaties
were
made
would
never
be
carried
out
all
resistance
on
their
part
proved
unavailing
and
inquietude
and
discontent
predominated
among
them
says
the
governor
of
idaho
in
shortly
after
by
the
organization
of
that
new
territory
the
nez
percés
reservation
had
been
removed
from
the
jurisdiction
of
washington
territory
to
that
of
idaho
a
powerful
party
was
organized
in
the
tribe
advocating
the
forming
of
a
league
with
the
crows
and
blackfeet
against
the
whites
the
of
promised
supplies
the
of
promised
moneys
the
unchecked
influx
of
miners
throughout
the
reservation
put
strong
weapons
into
the
hands
of
these
disaffected
ones
but
the
chiefs
remained
firm
and
unwavering
in
their
devotion
to
the
government
and
the
laws
they
are
head
chief
sawyer
particularly
tell
their
people
to
still
wait
patiently
and
yet
at
this
very
time
there
was
due
from
the
united
states
government
to
this
chief
sawyer
six
hundred
and
dollars
he
had
for
six
months
been
suffering
for
the
commonest
necessaries
of
life
and
had
been
driven
to
disposing
of
his
vouchers
at
fifty
cents
on
the
dollar
to
purchase
necessaries
the
warriors
also
who
fought
for
us
so
well
in
were
still
unpaid
although
in
the
seventh
article
of
the
treaty
of
it
had
been
agreed
that
the
claims
of
certain
members
of
the
nez
percé
tribe
against
the
government
for
services
rendered
and
horses
furnished
by
them
to
the
oregon
mounted
volunteers
as
appears
by
certificates
issued
by
fauntleroy
acting
regimental
quartermaster
and
commanding
oregon
volunteers
on
the
of
march
at
camp
cornelius
and
amounting
to
shall
be
paid
to
them
in
full
in
gold
coin
how
many
communities
of
white
men
would
remain
peaceable
loyal
and
friendly
under
such
a
strain
as
this
in
the
indian
bureau
report
of
the
state
of
our
diplomatic
relations
with
the
nez
percés
is
that
the
treaty
concluded
with
them
in
was
ratified
by
the
senate
with
an
amendment
which
awaited
the
action
of
the
indians
the
ratification
of
this
treaty
has
been
delayed
for
several
years
for
various
reasons
partly
arising
from
successive
changes
in
the
superintendent
of
indian
affairs
in
idaho
whose
varying
opinions
on
the
subject
of
the
treaty
have
caused
doubts
in
the
minds
of
senators
a
later
treaty
had
been
made
but
on
careful
consideration
of
the
subject
it
was
deemed
advisable
to
carry
into
effect
that
of
the
nez
percés
claimed
title
to
a
very
large
district
of
country
comprised
in
what
are
now
organized
as
oregon
washington
and
idaho
but
principally
within
the
latter
territory
and
already
a
large
white
population
is
pressing
upon
them
in
the
search
for
gold
they
are
peaceable
industrious
and
friendly
and
altogether
one
of
the
most
promising
of
the
tribes
west
of
the
rocky
mountains
having
profited
largely
by
the
labors
of
missionaries
among
them
by
the
treaty
ratified
in
this
year
they
give
up
all
their
lands
except
a
reservation
defined
by
certain
natural
boundaries
and
agree
to
remove
to
this
reservation
within
one
year
where
they
have
improvements
on
lands
outside
of
it
such
improvements
are
to
be
appraised
and
paid
for
the
tillable
lands
are
to
be
surveyed
into
tracts
of
twenty
acres
each
and
allotted
to
such
indians
as
desire
to
hold
lands
in
severalty
the
government
is
to
continue
the
annuities
due
under
former
treaties
and
in
addition
pay
the
tribe
or
expend
for
them
for
certain
specific
purposes
having
their
improvement
in
view
the
sum
of
and
a
moderate
sum
is
devoted
to
homes
and
salaries
for
chiefs
the
right
of
way
is
secured
through
the
reservation
and
the
government
undertakes
to
reserve
all
important
springs
and
for
public
use
in
this
same
year
the
governor
of
idaho
writes
in
his
annual
report
to
the
department
of
the
interior
prominent
among
the
tribes
of
northern
idaho
stand
the
nez
percés
a
majority
of
whom
boast
that
they
have
ever
been
the
faithful
friends
of
the
white
man
but
a
few
over
half
of
the
entire
tribe
of
the
nez
percés
are
under
treaty
the
fidelity
of
those
under
treaty
even
under
the
most
discouraging
circumstances
must
commend
itself
to
the
favorable
consideration
of
the
department
the
of
their
annuities
has
had
its
natural
effect
on
the
minds
of
some
of
those
under
treaty
but
their
confiding
head
chief
sawyer
remains
unmoved
and
on
all
occasions
is
found
the
faithful
apologist
for
any
failure
of
the
government
could
this
tribe
have
been
kept
aloof
from
the
contaminating
vices
of
white
men
and
had
it
been
in
the
power
of
the
government
promptly
to
comply
with
the
stipulations
of
the
treaty
of
there
can
be
no
doubt
but
that
their
condition
at
this
time
would
have
been
a
most
prosperous
one
and
that
the
whole
of
the
nez
percé
nation
would
by
this
time
have
been
willing
to
come
under
treaty
and
settle
on
the
reservation
with
those
already
there
in
the
patience
of
the
nez
percés
is
beginning
to
show
signs
of
wearing
out
the
governor
of
idaho
writes
this
disaffection
is
great
and
serious
trouble
is
imminent
it
could
all
be
settled
by
prompt
payment
by
the
government
of
their
just
dues
but
if
delayed
too
long
i
greatly
fear
open
hostilities
they
have
been
patient
but
promises
and
explanations
are
losing
force
with
them
now
their
grievances
are
urged
with
such
earnestness
that
even
sawyer
who
has
always
been
our
apologist
has
in
a
measure
abandoned
his
pacific
policy
and
asks
boldly
that
we
do
them
justice
even
now
it
may
not
be
too
late
but
if
neglected
war
may
be
reasonably
expected
should
the
nez
percés
strike
a
blow
all
over
our
territory
and
around
our
boundaries
will
blaze
the
and
gleam
the
tomahawks
of
the
pen
cœur
blackfeet
spokanes
pelouses
bannocks
and
shoshones
will
be
involved
this
disaffection
says
the
agent
began
to
show
itself
soon
after
the
visit
of
george
haigh
special
agent
last
december
to
obtain
their
assent
to
the
amendments
to
the
treaty
of
june
of
that
treaty
had
gone
on
so
long
and
promises
made
them
by
governor
lyon
that
it
would
not
be
ratified
and
that
he
was
authorized
to
make
a
new
treaty
with
them
by
which
they
would
retain
all
of
their
country
as
given
them
under
the
treaty
of
except
the
site
of
the
town
of
lewiston
they
had
also
been
informed
in
march
that
governor
lyon
would
be
here
in
the
june
following
to
pay
them
due
under
the
treaty
of
the
failure
to
carry
out
these
promises
and
the
idea
they
have
that
the
stipulations
of
the
treaty
of
will
be
carried
out
in
the
same
manner
is
one
of
the
causes
of
their
bad
feeling
it
showed
itself
plainly
at
the
council
lately
held
and
is
on
the
increase
if
there
is
the
same
delay
in
carrying
out
the
stipulations
of
the
treaty
of
that
there
has
been
in
that
of
some
of
the
chiefs
with
their
bands
will
join
the
hostile
indians
there
are
many
things
it
is
impossible
to
explain
to
them
they
can
not
understand
why
the
that
was
promised
by
governor
lyon
to
the
indian
laborers
on
the
church
is
not
paid
he
told
them
when
the
walls
were
up
they
should
receive
their
pay
these
laborers
were
poor
men
and
such
inducements
were
held
out
to
them
that
they
commenced
the
work
in
good
faith
with
the
full
expectation
of
receiving
their
pay
when
their
labors
ceased
the
head
chief
sawyer
pay
is
still
in
arrears
for
the
last
quarter
of
and
the
first
and
second
of
he
has
received
no
pay
no
wonder
he
has
ceased
to
be
the
apologist
of
the
government
which
four
years
ago
promised
him
an
annuity
of
a
year
spite
of
this
increasing
disaffection
the
nez
percés
are
industrious
and
prosperous
they
raised
in
this
year
bushels
of
wheat
many
of
them
carried
their
wheat
to
be
ground
to
the
mills
while
many
sold
the
grain
to
packers
for
feed
while
much
of
it
is
boiled
whole
for
food
some
few
of
the
better
class
have
had
their
wheat
ground
and
sold
the
flour
in
the
at
lower
prices
than
packers
could
lay
it
down
in
the
camps
some
have
small
running
through
the
summer
one
in
particular
runs
some
fifteen
animals
he
sometimes
packs
for
whites
and
again
runs
on
his
own
account
a
clearwater
station
merchant
a
short
time
ago
informed
me
of
his
buying
some
oats
of
last
fall
after
the
grain
had
been
weighed
and
emptied
out
of
the
sacks
the
indian
brought
the
empty
sacks
to
the
scales
to
have
them
weighed
and
the
tare
deducted
saying
he
only
wanted
pay
for
the
oats
their
sales
of
melons
tomatoes
corn
potatoes
squashes
green
pease
during
the
summer
in
the
different
towns
and
bring
in
some
to
their
stock
of
horses
and
cattle
is
increasing
fast
and
with
the
benefits
to
be
derived
from
good
american
stallions
and
good
bulls
and
cows
to
be
distributed
to
them
under
the
stipulations
of
the
treaty
of
they
will
rapidly
increase
in
wealth
in
their
reservation
is
still
unsurveyed
and
when
the
indians
claim
that
white
settlers
are
establishing
themselves
inside
the
lines
there
is
no
way
of
proving
it
and
the
agent
says
all
he
can
do
is
to
promise
that
the
white
man
heart
shall
be
better
and
thus
the
matter
will
rest
until
another
disturbance
arises
when
the
same
complaints
are
made
and
the
same
answers
given
as
the
white
man
heart
shall
be
better
and
the
shall
be
surveyed
other
treaty
stipulations
are
still
unfulfilled
and
the
party
while
entirely
peaceable
is
very
strong
and
immovably
opposed
to
treaties
in
seven
years
after
it
was
promised
the
long
deferred
survey
of
the
reservation
was
made
the
superintendent
and
the
agent
both
remonstrated
but
in
vain
against
the
manner
in
which
it
was
done
and
three
years
later
a
board
of
special
commissioners
appointed
to
inquire
into
the
condition
of
the
indians
in
idaho
examined
the
fence
put
up
at
that
time
and
reported
that
it
was
a
most
scandalous
fraud
it
is
a
fence
the
posts
are
not
well
set
much
of
the
lumber
is
deficient
in
width
and
length
the
posts
are
not
dressed
the
lumber
laps
at
any
joint
where
it
may
chance
to
meet
whether
on
the
posts
or
between
them
and
the
boards
are
not
jointed
on
the
posts
where
they
meet
they
are
lapped
and
fastened
generally
with
one
nail
so
that
they
are
falling
down
rapidly
the
lumber
was
cut
on
the
reservation
the
contract
price
of
the
fence
was
very
high
the
fencing
done
in
places
of
no
value
to
any
one
for
the
reason
that
water
can
not
be
had
for
irrigation
the
government
can
not
be
a
party
to
such
frauds
on
the
people
who
intrust
it
with
their
property
in
this
year
a
commission
was
sent
to
oregon
to
hold
council
with
the
band
of
nez
percés
occupying
wallowa
valley
in
oregon
with
a
view
to
their
removal
if
practicable
to
the
nez
percé
reservation
in
idaho
they
reported
this
removal
to
be
impracticable
and
the
wallowa
valley
has
been
withdrawn
from
sale
and
set
apart
for
their
use
and
occupation
by
executive
order
footnote
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
for
this
commission
report
that
one
of
the
most
troublesome
questions
in
the
way
of
the
government
control
of
indian
affairs
in
idaho
is
the
contest
between
the
catholic
and
protestant
churches
this
strife
is
a
great
detriment
to
the
indians
to
illustrate
this
they
quote
chief
joseph
reason
for
not
wishing
schools
on
his
reservation
he
was
the
chief
of
the
band
of
nez
percés
occupying
the
wallowa
valley
in
oregon
do
you
want
schools
and
on
the
wallowa
reservation
asked
the
commissioners
no
we
do
not
want
schools
or
on
the
wallowa
reservation
why
do
you
not
want
schools
they
will
teach
us
to
have
churches
do
you
not
want
churches
no
we
do
not
want
churches
why
do
you
not
want
churches
they
will
teach
us
to
quarrel
about
god
as
the
catholics
and
protestants
do
on
the
nez
percé
reservation
and
at
other
places
we
do
not
want
to
learn
that
we
may
quarrel
with
men
sometimes
about
things
on
this
earth
but
we
never
quarrel
about
god
we
do
not
want
to
learn
that
great
excitement
prevailed
among
the
settlers
in
oregon
at
the
cession
of
the
wallowa
valley
to
the
indians
the
presence
of
united
states
soldiers
prevented
any
outbreak
but
the
resentment
of
the
whites
was
very
strong
and
threats
were
openly
made
that
the
indians
should
not
be
permitted
to
occupy
it
and
in
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
writes
the
settlements
made
in
the
wallowa
valley
which
has
for
years
been
the
of
the
large
herds
of
horses
owned
by
joseph
band
will
occasion
more
or
less
trouble
between
this
band
and
the
whites
until
joseph
is
induced
or
compelled
to
settle
on
his
reservation
it
is
only
two
years
since
this
valley
was
set
apart
by
executive
order
for
the
use
and
occupation
of
these
indians
already
the
department
is
contemplating
compelling
them
to
leave
it
and
go
to
the
reservation
in
idaho
there
were
stormy
scenes
there
also
during
this
year
suits
were
brought
against
all
the
employés
of
the
lapwai
agency
and
a
claim
set
up
for
all
the
lands
of
the
agency
and
for
many
of
the
indian
farms
by
one
langford
representing
the
old
claim
of
the
missionaries
to
whom
a
large
tract
of
ground
had
been
ceded
some
thirty
years
before
he
attempted
to
take
forcible
possession
of
the
place
and
was
ejected
finally
by
military
force
after
the
decision
of
the
had
been
given
that
his
claim
was
invalid
the
indian
bureau
recommended
a
revocation
of
the
executive
order
giving
the
wallowa
valley
to
joseph
and
his
band
in
june
of
this
year
president
grant
revoked
the
order
and
in
the
autumn
a
commission
was
sent
out
to
visit
these
indians
with
a
view
to
secure
their
permanent
settlement
on
the
reservation
their
early
entrance
on
a
civilized
life
and
to
adjust
the
difficulties
then
existing
between
them
and
the
settlers
it
is
worth
while
to
study
with
some
care
the
reasons
which
this
commission
gave
to
chief
joseph
why
the
wallowa
valley
which
had
been
given
to
him
by
executive
order
in
must
be
taken
away
from
him
by
executive
order
in
owing
to
the
coldness
of
the
climate
it
is
not
a
suitable
location
for
an
indian
reservation
it
is
now
in
part
settled
by
white
squatters
for
grazing
purposes
the
president
claimed
that
he
extinguished
the
indian
title
to
it
by
the
treaty
of
it
is
embraced
within
the
limits
of
the
state
of
oregon
the
state
of
oregon
could
not
probably
be
induced
to
cede
the
jurisdiction
of
the
valley
to
the
united
states
for
an
indian
reservation
in
the
conflicts
which
might
arise
in
the
future
as
in
the
past
between
him
and
the
whites
the
president
might
not
be
able
to
justify
or
defend
him
a
part
of
the
valley
had
already
been
surveyed
and
opened
to
settlement
if
by
some
arrangement
the
white
settlers
in
the
valley
could
be
induced
to
leave
it
others
would
come
to
all
these
statements
joseph
replied
that
he
asked
nothing
of
the
president
he
was
able
to
take
care
of
himself
he
did
not
desire
wallowa
valley
as
a
reservation
for
that
would
subject
him
and
his
band
to
the
will
of
and
dependence
on
another
and
to
laws
not
of
their
own
making
he
was
disposed
to
live
peaceably
he
and
his
band
had
suffered
wrong
rather
than
do
wrong
one
of
their
number
was
wickedly
slain
by
a
white
man
during
the
last
summer
but
he
would
not
avenge
his
death
the
serious
and
feeling
manner
in
which
he
uttered
these
sentiments
was
impressive
the
commissioners
say
and
they
proceeded
to
reply
to
him
that
the
president
was
not
disposed
to
deprive
him
of
any
just
right
or
govern
him
by
his
individual
will
but
merely
subject
him
to
the
same
just
and
equal
laws
by
which
he
himself
as
well
as
all
his
people
were
ruled
what
does
it
mean
when
commissioners
sent
by
the
president
to
induce
a
band
of
indians
to
go
on
a
reservation
to
live
tell
them
that
they
shall
be
subjected
on
that
reservation
merely
to
the
same
just
and
equal
laws
by
which
the
president
and
all
his
people
are
ruled
and
still
more
what
is
the
explanation
of
their
being
so
apparently
unaware
of
the
enormity
of
the
lie
that
they
leave
it
on
official
record
signed
by
their
names
in
full
it
is
only
explained
as
thousands
of
other
things
in
the
history
of
our
dealings
with
the
indians
are
only
to
be
explained
by
the
habitual
indifference
carelessness
and
inattention
with
which
questions
relative
to
indian
affairs
and
legislation
thereon
are
handled
and
disposed
of
in
whatever
way
seems
easiest
and
shortest
for
the
time
being
the
members
of
this
commission
knew
perfectly
well
that
the
instant
joseph
and
his
band
moved
on
to
the
reservation
they
became
subject
to
laws
totally
different
from
those
by
which
the
president
and
all
his
people
were
ruled
and
neither
just
nor
equal
laws
forbidding
them
to
go
beyond
certain
bounds
without
a
pass
from
the
agent
laws
making
them
really
just
as
much
prisoners
as
convicts
in
a
only
difference
being
that
the
reservation
is
an
unwalled
prison
laws
giving
that
agent
power
to
summon
military
power
at
any
moment
to
enforce
any
command
he
might
choose
to
lay
on
them
and
to
shoot
them
if
they
refused
to
obey
the
same
just
and
equal
laws
by
which
the
president
himself
and
all
his
people
are
ruled
truly
it
is
a
psychological
phenomenon
that
four
men
should
be
found
willing
to
leave
it
on
record
under
their
own
signatures
that
they
said
this
thing
footnote
witness
the
murder
of
big
snake
on
the
ponca
reservation
indian
territory
in
the
summer
of
farther
on
in
the
same
report
there
is
an
enumeration
of
some
of
the
experiences
which
the
nez
percés
who
are
on
the
idaho
reservation
have
had
of
the
advantages
of
living
there
and
of
the
manner
in
which
the
government
has
fulfilled
its
promises
by
which
it
induced
them
to
go
there
undoubtedly
these
were
all
as
well
known
to
chief
joseph
as
to
the
commissioners
for
years
he
had
had
an
opportunity
to
study
the
workings
of
the
reservation
policy
they
say
during
an
interview
held
with
the
agent
and
the
treaty
indians
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
whether
there
were
sufficient
unoccupied
tillable
lands
for
joseph
band
on
the
reservation
and
for
the
further
purpose
of
securing
their
to
aid
us
in
inducing
joseph
to
come
upon
the
reservation
facts
were
brought
to
our
attention
of
a
failure
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
fulfil
its
treaty
stipulations
with
these
indians
the
commission
therefore
deem
it
their
duty
to
call
the
attention
of
the
government
to
this
subject
article
second
of
the
treaty
of
june
provides
that
no
white
such
as
may
be
employed
by
the
indian
be
permitted
to
reside
upon
the
reservation
without
permission
of
the
tribe
and
the
superintendent
and
the
agent
nevertheless
four
white
men
are
occupying
or
claiming
large
tracts
on
the
reservation
it
is
clearly
the
duty
of
the
government
to
adjust
and
quiet
these
claims
and
remove
the
parties
from
the
reservation
each
day
delay
to
fulfil
this
treaty
stipulation
adds
to
the
distrust
of
the
indians
in
the
good
faith
of
the
government
article
third
of
the
same
treaty
of
provides
for
the
survey
of
the
land
suitable
for
cultivation
into
lots
of
twenty
acres
each
while
a
survey
is
reported
to
have
been
early
made
no
measures
were
then
or
have
been
since
taken
to
adjust
farm
limits
to
the
lines
of
the
surveyed
lots
rules
and
regulations
for
continuing
the
possession
of
these
lots
and
the
improvements
thereon
in
the
families
of
deceased
indians
have
not
been
prescribed
as
required
by
the
treaty
it
is
also
provided
that
certificates
or
deeds
for
such
tracts
shall
be
issued
to
individual
indians
the
failure
of
the
government
to
comply
with
this
important
provision
of
the
treaty
causes
much
uneasiness
among
the
indians
who
are
little
inclined
to
spend
their
labor
and
means
in
improving
ground
held
by
the
uncertain
tenure
of
the
pleasure
of
an
agent
article
seventh
of
the
treaty
provides
for
a
payment
of
four
thousand
six
hundred
and
dollars
in
gold
coin
to
them
for
services
and
horses
furnished
the
oregon
mounted
volunteers
in
it
is
asserted
by
the
indians
that
this
provision
of
the
treaty
has
hitherto
been
disregarded
by
the
government
the
commissioners
say
that
every
consideration
of
justice
and
equity
as
well
as
expediency
demands
from
the
government
a
faithful
and
literal
compliance
with
all
its
treaty
obligations
toward
the
indians
a
failure
to
do
this
is
looked
upon
as
bad
faith
and
can
be
productive
of
only
bad
results
at
last
chief
joseph
consented
to
remove
from
the
wallowa
valley
with
his
band
and
go
to
the
lapwai
reservation
the
incidents
of
the
council
in
which
this
consent
was
finally
wrung
from
him
are
left
on
record
in
chief
joseph
own
words
in
an
article
written
by
him
through
an
interpreter
and
published
in
the
american
in
it
is
a
remarkable
contribution
to
indian
history
it
drew
out
a
reply
from
general
howard
who
called
his
paper
the
true
history
of
the
wallowa
campaign
published
in
the
american
two
months
after
chief
joseph
paper
between
the
accounts
given
by
general
howard
and
by
chief
joseph
of
the
events
preceding
the
nez
percé
war
there
are
noticeable
discrepancies
general
howard
says
that
he
listened
to
the
dreamer
nonsense
of
the
chief
with
no
impatience
but
finally
said
to
him
times
over
i
hear
that
the
earth
is
your
mother
and
about
the
chieftainship
of
the
earth
i
want
to
hear
it
no
more
chief
joseph
says
general
howard
lost
his
temper
and
said
up
i
do
want
to
hear
any
more
of
such
talk
answered
are
you
that
you
ask
us
to
talk
and
then
tell
me
i
talk
are
you
the
great
spirit
did
you
make
the
world
general
howard
quoting
from
his
record
at
the
time
says
the
rough
old
fellow
in
his
most
provoking
tone
says
something
in
a
short
sentence
looking
fiercely
at
me
the
interpreter
quickly
says
demands
what
person
pretends
to
divide
this
land
and
put
me
on
it
in
the
most
decided
voice
i
said
am
the
man
i
stand
here
for
the
president
and
there
is
no
spirit
bad
or
good
that
will
hinder
me
my
orders
are
plain
and
will
be
executed
chief
joseph
says
general
howard
replied
are
an
impudent
fellow
and
i
will
put
you
in
the
and
then
ordered
a
soldier
to
arrest
him
general
howard
says
after
telling
the
indians
that
this
bad
advice
would
be
their
ruin
i
asked
the
chiefs
to
go
with
me
to
look
at
their
land
old
man
shall
not
go
i
will
leave
him
with
colonel
perry
he
says
you
want
to
scare
me
with
reference
to
my
body
i
said
will
leave
your
body
with
colonel
perry
i
then
arose
and
led
him
out
of
the
council
and
gave
him
into
the
charge
of
colonel
perry
chief
joseph
says
made
no
resistance
he
asked
general
howard
that
your
order
i
do
care
i
have
expressed
my
heart
to
you
i
have
nothing
to
take
back
i
have
spoken
for
my
country
you
can
arrest
me
but
you
can
not
change
me
or
make
me
take
back
what
i
have
said
the
soldiers
came
forward
and
seized
my
friend
and
took
him
to
the
my
men
whispered
among
themselves
whether
they
should
let
this
thing
be
done
i
counselled
them
to
submit
was
prisoner
for
five
days
before
he
was
released
general
howard
it
will
be
observed
does
not
use
the
word
arrested
but
as
he
says
later
was
released
on
the
pledge
of
and
white
bird
and
on
his
own
earnest
promise
to
behave
better
it
is
plain
that
chief
joseph
did
not
misstate
the
facts
this
indian
chief
therefore
was
put
under
military
arrest
and
confined
for
five
days
for
uttering
what
general
howard
calls
a
tirade
in
a
council
to
which
the
indians
had
been
asked
to
come
for
the
purpose
of
consultation
and
expression
of
sentiment
does
not
chief
joseph
speak
as
well
as
natural
feeling
in
saying
i
turned
to
my
people
and
said
arrest
of
was
wrong
but
we
will
not
resent
the
insult
we
were
invited
to
this
council
to
express
our
hearts
and
we
have
done
so
if
such
and
so
swift
penalty
as
this
for
tirades
in
council
were
the
law
of
our
land
especially
in
the
district
of
columbia
it
would
be
no
just
cause
of
complaint
when
indians
suffer
it
but
considering
the
frequency
length
and
safety
of
tirades
in
all
parts
of
america
it
seems
unjust
not
to
permit
indians
to
deliver
them
however
they
do
come
under
the
head
of
spontaneous
productions
of
the
soil
and
an
indian
on
a
reservation
is
invested
with
no
such
proprietorship
in
anything
which
comes
under
that
head
footnote
annual
report
of
the
indian
commissioner
for
chief
joseph
and
his
band
consented
to
move
chief
joseph
says
i
said
in
my
heart
that
rather
than
have
war
i
would
give
up
my
country
i
would
give
up
my
father
grave
i
would
give
up
everything
rather
than
have
the
blood
of
white
men
upon
the
hands
of
my
people
it
was
not
easy
for
joseph
to
bring
his
people
to
consent
to
move
the
young
men
wished
to
fight
it
has
been
told
that
at
this
time
chief
joseph
rode
one
day
through
his
village
with
a
revolver
in
each
hand
saying
he
would
shoot
the
first
one
of
his
warriors
that
resisted
the
government
finally
they
gathered
all
the
stock
they
could
find
and
began
the
move
a
storm
came
and
raised
the
river
so
high
that
some
of
the
cattle
could
not
be
taken
across
indian
guards
were
put
in
charge
of
the
cattle
left
behind
white
men
attacked
these
guards
and
took
the
cattle
after
this
joseph
could
no
longer
restrain
his
men
and
the
warfare
began
which
lasted
over
two
months
it
was
a
masterly
campaign
on
the
part
of
the
indians
they
were
followed
by
general
howard
they
had
general
crook
on
their
right
and
general
miles
in
front
but
they
were
not
once
hemmed
in
and
at
last
when
they
surrendered
at
bear
paw
mountain
in
the
montana
hills
it
was
not
because
they
were
beaten
but
because
as
joseph
says
i
could
not
bear
to
see
my
wounded
men
and
women
suffer
any
longer
we
had
lost
enough
already
we
could
have
escaped
from
bear
paw
mountain
if
we
had
left
our
wounded
old
women
and
children
behind
we
were
unwilling
to
do
this
we
had
never
heard
of
a
wounded
indian
recovering
while
in
the
hands
of
white
men
i
believed
general
miles
or
i
never
would
have
surrendered
i
have
heard
that
he
has
been
censured
for
making
the
promise
to
return
us
to
lapwai
he
could
not
have
made
any
other
terms
with
me
at
that
time
i
could
have
held
him
in
check
until
my
friends
came
to
my
assistance
and
then
neither
of
the
generals
nor
their
soldiers
would
ever
have
left
bear
paw
mountain
alive
on
the
fifth
day
i
went
to
general
miles
and
gave
up
my
gun
and
said
where
the
sun
now
stands
i
will
fight
no
more
my
people
needed
rest
we
wanted
peace
the
terms
of
this
surrender
were
shamefully
violated
joseph
and
his
band
were
taken
first
to
fort
leavenworth
and
then
to
the
indian
territory
at
leavenworth
they
were
placed
in
the
river
bottom
with
no
water
but
the
river
water
to
drink
many
of
my
people
sickened
and
died
and
we
buried
them
in
this
strange
land
says
joseph
i
can
not
tell
how
much
my
heart
suffered
for
my
people
while
at
leavenworth
the
great
spirit
chief
who
rules
above
seemed
to
be
looking
some
other
way
and
did
not
see
what
was
being
done
to
my
people
yet
with
a
marvellous
magnanimity
and
a
sense
of
justice
of
which
few
men
would
be
capable
under
the
circumstances
joseph
says
i
believe
general
miles
would
have
kept
his
word
if
he
could
have
done
so
i
do
not
blame
him
for
what
we
have
suffered
since
the
surrender
i
do
not
know
who
is
to
blame
we
gave
up
all
our
horses
over
eleven
hundred
and
all
our
saddles
over
one
hundred
and
we
have
not
heard
from
them
since
somebody
has
got
our
horses
this
narrative
of
chief
joseph
is
profoundly
touching
a
very
iliad
of
tragedy
of
dignified
and
hopeless
sorrow
and
it
stands
supported
by
the
official
records
of
the
indian
bureau
after
the
arrival
of
joseph
and
his
band
in
indian
territory
the
bad
effect
of
their

among
them
is
more
pathetic
than
the
accounts
of
their
simple
hospitality
their
unstinted
invitations
and
their
guileless
expressions
of
desire
for
a
greater
knowledge
of
the
white
men
ways
when
that
saintly
old
bigot
father
hennepin
sailed
up
the
illinois
river
in
carrying
his
portable
chapel
chalice
and
chasuble
and
a
few
holy
wafers
in
a
steel
box
shut
very
close
going
to
teach
the
savages
the
knowledge
of
the
captain
of
heaven
and
earth
and
to
use
and
several
other
things
relating
to
their
advantage
the
illinois
were
so
terrified
that
although
they
were
several
thousand
strong
they
took
to
flight
with
horrid
cries
and
howlings
on
being
reassured
by
signs
and
words
of
friendliness
they
slowly
however
not
until
three
or
four
days
had
passed
then
they
listened
to
the
good
man
discourses
with
great
attention
afterward
gave
a
great
shout
for
joy
and
expressed
a
great
gratitude
and
the
missionaries
being
footsore
from
long
travel
the
kindly
creatures
fell
to
rubbing
their
legs
and
feet
with
oil
of
bears
and
grease
of
wild
oxen
which
after
much
travel
is
an
incomparable
refreshment
and
presented
us
some
flesh
to
eat
putting
the
three
first
morsels
into
our
mouths
with
great
ceremonies
it
was
a
pity
that
father
hennepin
had
no
more
tangible
benefit
than
the
doctrine
of
the
efficacy
of
the
sacraments
to
communicate
to
the
hospitable
illinois
in
return
for
their
healing
ointments
naturally
they
did
not
appreciate
this
and
he
proceeded
on
his
way
disheartened
by
their
brutish
stupidity
but
consoling
himself
however
with
the
thought
of
the
infants
he
had
baptized
hearing
of
the
death
of
one
of
them
he
says
he
is
glad
it
had
pleased
god
to
take
this
little
christian
out
of
the
world
and
he
attributed
his
own
preservation
amidst
the
greatest
dangers
afterward
to
the
care
he
took
for
its
baptism
those
dangers
were
indeed
by
no
means
inconsiderable
as
he
and
his
party
were
taken
prisoners
by
a
roaming
party
of
these
indians
called
in
the
father
quaint
old
book
nadouwessians
he
was
forced
to
accompany
them
on
their
expeditions
and
was
in
daily
danger
of
being
murdered
by
the
more
riotous
and
hostile
members
of
the
band
he
found
these
savages
on
the
whole
men
affable
civil
and
obliging
and
he
was
indebted
for
his
life
to
the
of
one
of
the
chiefs
who
protected
him
again
and
again
at
no
inconsiderable
danger
to
himself
the
only
evidence
of
religion
among
the
nadouwessies
which
he
mentions
is
that
they
never
began
to
smoke
without
first
holding
the
pipe
up
to
the
sun
saying
smoke
sun
they
also
offered
to
the
sun
the
best
part
of
every
beast
they
killed
carrying
it
afterward
to
the
cabin
of
their
chief
from
which
father
hennepin
concluded
that
they
had
a
religious
veneration
for
the
sun
the
diplomatic
relations
between
the
united
states
government
and
the
sioux
began
in
the
year
in
that
year
and
the
year
following
we
made
sixteen
treaties
of
peace
and
friendship
with
different
tribes
of
demanding
no
cessions
of
land
beyond
the
original
grants
which
had
been
made
by
these
tribes
to
the
english
french
or
spanish
governments
but
confirming
those
to
the
united
states
promising
perpetual
peace
and
declaring
that
every
injury
or
act
of
hostility
committed
by
one
or
other
of
the
contracting
parties
shall
be
mutually
forgiven
and
forgot
three
of
these
treaties
were
made
with
bands
of
the
of
them
with
the
sioux
of
the
leaf
the
sioux
of
the
broad
leaf
and
the
sioux
who
shoot
in
the
in
four
more
treaties
were
made
with
separate
sioux
bands
by
one
of
those
of
prairie
du
were
defined
between
the
chippewas
and
the
sioux
and
it
was
hoped
that
their
incessant
feuds
might
be
brought
to
an
end
this
hostility
had
continued
unabated
from
the
time
of
the
earliest
travellers
in
the
country
and
the
sioux
had
been
slowly
but
steadily
driven
south
and
west
by
the
victorious
chippewas
a
treaty
could
not
avail
very
much
toward
keeping
peace
between
such
ancient
enemies
as
these
fighting
went
on
as
before
and
white
traders
being
exposed
to
the
attacks
of
all
suffered
almost
more
than
the
indians
themselves
the
government
consoled
itself
for
this
spectacle
of
bloody
war
which
it
was
powerless
to
prevent
by
the
thought
that
the
indians
would
probably
fight
on
until
some
one
or
other
of
the
tribes
shall
become
too
reduced
and
feeble
to
carry
on
the
war
when
it
will
be
lost
as
a
separate
power
equivocal
bit
of
philosophizing
which
was
unequivocally
stated
in
these
precise
words
in
one
of
the
annual
reports
of
the
war
department
in
the
third
article
of
the
next
treaty
also
at
prairie
du
chien
in
began
the
trouble
which
has
been
from
that
day
to
this
a
source
of
never
ending
misunderstanding
and
of
many
fierce
outbreaks
on
the
part
of
the
sioux
four
of
the
bands
by
this
article
ceded
and
relinquished
to
the
united
states
forever

certain
tract
of
country
between
the
mississippi
and
the
des
moines
river
in
this
and
in
a
still
further
cession
two
other
bands
of
sioux
who
were
not
fully
represented
at
the
council
must
join
also
some
four
or
five
other
tribes
landed
and
undivided
estate
owned
in
common
by
dozens
of
families
would
be
a
very
difficult
thing
to
parcel
out
and
transfer
among
white
men
with
the
best
that
fair
intentions
and
legal
skill
combined
could
do
how
much
more
so
in
those
days
of
unsurveyed
forests
unexplored
rivers
owned
and
occupied
in
common
by
dozens
of
bands
of
wild
and
ignorant
indians
to
be
communicated
with
only
by
interpreters
misconstructions
and
disputes
about
boundaries
would
have
been
inevitable
even
if
there
had
been
all
possible
fairmindedness
and
on
both
sides
but
in
this
case
there
was
only
unfairmindedness
on
one
side
and
unwillingness
on
the
other
all
the
early
makers
of

indians
congratulated
themselves
and
the
united
states
on
the
getting
of
acres
of
valuable
land
by
the
million
for
next
to
nothing
and
as
years
went
on
openly
lamented
that
the
indians
were
beginning
to
find
out
what
lands
were
worth

the
indians

increasing
sense
of
loss

than
impolitic
for

the
first
annuities
promised
to
the

were
promised
by
this
annually
for
ten
years
to
the
yankton

to

the
yankton
and

were

it
was
soon
after
these
treaties
that
the
artist
catlin
made
his
famous
journeys
among
the
north
american
indians
and
gave
to
the
world
an
invaluable
contribution
to
their
history
perpetuating
in
his
pictures
the
distinctive
traits
of
their
faces
and
their
dress
and
leaving
on
record
many
pages
of
unassailable
testimony
as
to
their
characteristics
in
their
native
state
he
spent
several
weeks
among
the
sioux
and
says
of
them
there
is
no
tribe
on
the
continent
of
finer
looking
men
and
few
tribes
who
are
better
and
more
comfortably
clad
and
supplied
with
the
necessaries
of
life
i
have
travelled
several
years
already
among
these
people
and
i
have
not
had
my
scalp
taken
nor
a
blow
struck
me
nor
had
occasion
to
raise
my
hand
against
an
indian
nor
has
my
property
been
stolen
as
yet
to
my
knowledge
to
the
value
of
a
shilling
and
that
in
a
country
where
no
man
is
punishable
by
law
for
the
crime
of
stealing
that
the
indians
in
their
native
state
are
drunken
is
false
for
they
are
the
only
temperance
people
literally
speaking
that
ever
i
saw
in
my
travels
or
expect
to
see
if
the
civilized
world
are
startled
at
this
it
is
the
fact
that
they
must
battle
with
not
with
me
these
people
manufacture
no
spirituous
liquor
themselves
and
know
nothing
of
it
until
it
is
brought
into
their
country
and
tendered
to
them
by
christians
that
these
people
are
naked
is
equally
untrue
and
as
easily
disproved
with
the
paintings
i
have
made
and
with
their
beautiful
costumes
which
i
shall
bring
home
i
shall
be
able
to
establish
the
fact
that
many
of
these
people
dress
not
only
with
clothes
comfortable
for
any
latitude
but
that
they
dress
also
with
some
considerable
taste
and
elegance
nor
am
i
quite
sure
that
they
are
entitled
to
the
name
of
who
live
in
a
country
of
boundless
green
fields
with
good
horses
to
ride
where
they
are
all
joint
tenants
of
the
soil
together

the
great
spirit
has
supplied
them
with
an
abundance

catlin
found
six
hundred
families
of
the
sioux
camped
at
one
time
around
fort
pierre
at
the
mouth
of
the
teton
river
on
the
west
bank
of
the
missouri
there
were
some
twenty
bands
each
with
their
chief
over
whom
was
one
superior
chief
called
the
one
horn
whose
portrait
is
one
of
the
finest
in
catlin
book
this
chief
took
his
name
one
horn
from
a
little
shell
which
he
wore
always
on
his
neck
this
shell
had
descended
to
him
from
his
father
and
he
said
he
valued
it
more
than
anything
which
he
possessed
affording
a
striking
instance
of
the
living
affection
which
these
people
often
cherish
for
the
dead
inasmuch
as
he
chose
to
carry
this
name
through
life
in
preference
to
many
others
and
more
honorable
ones
he
had
a
right
to
have
taken
from
different
battles
and
exploits
of
his
extraordinary
life
he
was
the
fleetest
man
in
the
tribe
could
run
down
a
buffalo
which
he
had
often
done
on
his
own
legs
and
drive
his
arrow
to
the
heart
this
chief
came
to
his
death
several
years
later
in
a
tragic
way
he
had
been
in
some
way
the
accidental
cause
of
the
death
of
his
only
very
fine
so
great
was
the
anguish
of
his
mind
at
times
that
he
became
insane
in
one
of
these
moods
he
mounted
his
favorite
with
his
bow
and
arrows
in
his
hand
and
dashed
off
at
full
speed
upon
the
prairies
repeating
the
most
solemn
oath
that
he
would
slay
the
first
living
thing
that
fell
in
his
way
be
it
man
or
beast
friend
or
foe
no
one
dared
follow
him
and
after
he
had
been
absent
an
hour
or
two
his
horse
came
back
to
the
village
with
two
arrows
in
its
body
covered
with
blood
fears
of
the
most
serious
kind
were
now
entertained
for
the
fate
of
the
chief
and
a
party
of
warriors
immediately
mounted
their
horses
and
retraced
the
animal
tracks
to
the
place
of
the
tragedy
where
they
found
the
body
of
their
chief
horribly
mangled
and
gored
by
a
whose
carcass
was
stretched
by
the
side
of
him
a
close
examination
of
the
ground
was
then
made
by
the
indians
who
ascertained
by
the
tracks
that
their
unfortunate
chief
under
his
unlucky
resolve
had
met
a
in
the
season
when
they
are
very
stubborn
and
unwilling
to
run
from
any
one
and
had
incensed
the
animal
by
shooting
a
number
of
arrows
into
him
which
had
brought
him
into
furious
combat
the
chief
had
then
dismounted
and
turned
his
horse
loose
having
given
it
a
couple
of
arrows
from
his
bow
which
sent
it
home
at
full
speed
and
then
had
thrown
away
his
bow
and
quiver
encountering
the
infuriated
animal
with
his
knife
alone
and
the
desperate
battle
had
resulted
in
the
death
of
both
many
of
the
bones
of
the
chief
were
broken
and
his
huge
antagonist
lay
dead
by
his
side
weltering
in
blood
from
a
hundred
wounds
made
by
the
chief
long
and
knife
had
the
provisions
of
these
first
treaties
been
fairly
and
promptly
carried
out
there
would
have
been
living
among
the
citizens
of
minnesota
thousands
of
sioux
families
good
and
prosperous
farmers
and
mechanics
whose
civilization
would
have
dated
back
to
the
treaty
of
prairie
du
chien
in
looking
through
the
records
of
the
expenditures
of
the
indian
bureau
for
the
six
years
following
this
treaty
we
find
no
mention
of
any
specific
provisions
for
the
sioux
in
the
matter
of
education
the
annually
which
the
treaty
promised
should
be
spent
on
account
of
the
children
of
the
said
tribes
and
bands
is
set
down
as
expended
on
the
choctaw
academy
which
was
in
kentucky
a
very
well
endowed
institution
that
must
have
been
if
we
may
trust
to
the
fiscal
reports
of
the
indian
bureau
in
the
year
there
were
set
down
as
expended
on
this
academy
on
account
of
the
miamis
the
pottawattomies
the
sacs
foxes
and
others
the
choctaws
the
creeks
east
the
cherokees
west
the
florida
indians
the
quapaws
the
chickasaws
the
creeks
being
a
total

were
in
this
year
one
hundred

pupils
at
the
choctaw
academy
sixteen
of
them
being

sioux
and
others
represented
in
the
treaty
of

du

the
education
of
these
sixteen
children
therefore
these
tribes
paid
a
year
the
miamis
paid
more
in
proportion
having
but
four
youths
at
school
and
a
year
charged
to
them
the
pottawattomies
on
a
treaty

of
educated
twenty

appropriated
for
the
purpose
of
extinguishing
the
indian
title
between
the
state
of
missouri
and
the
missouri
river
the
land
owned
here
by
the
indians
was
a
long
narrow
belt
of
country
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
indian
country
by
the
missouri
river
the
importance
of
it
to
the
state
of
missouri
was
obvious
convenience
and
necessity
the
citizens
of
missouri
made
representations
to
this
effect
and
though
the
president
is
said
to
have
been
unwilling
to
assent
as
it
would
be
in
disregard
of
the
guarantee
given
to
the
indians
in
the
treaty
of
prairie
du
chien
and
might
be
considered
by
them
as
the
first
step
in
a
series
of
efforts
to
obtain
possession
of
their
new
country
he
nevertheless
consented
that
the
question
of
such
a
cession
should
be
submitted
to
them
accordingly
negotiations
were
opened
and
nearly
all
the
indians
who
had
rights
in
these
lands
seeing
that
from
their
local
position
they
could
never
be
made
available
for
indian
purposes
relinquished
them
footnote
for
this
relinquishment
the
government
gave
to
the
lower
sioux
presents
to
the
amount
of
and
to
the
upper
bands
in
goods
in
the
government
invited
deputations
of
chiefs
from
many
of
the
principal
tribes
to
come
to
washington
it
was
believed
to
be
important

exhibit
to
them
the
strength
of
the
nation
they
would
have
to
contend
with
if
they
ventured
to
attack
our
borders
and
at
the
same
time
to
impress
upon
them
the
advantages
which
flow
from
civilization
among
these
chiefs
came
thirty
chiefs
and
headmen
of
the
sioux
and
being
duly
impressed
as
was
most
natural
concluded
treaties
by
which
they
ceded
to
the
united
states
all
their
land
east
of
the
mississippi
river
and
all
their

the
agent
writes
that
it

obvious
to
any
one
that

intercourse
on

part
is
impracticable
and
that
his
interviews
with
many
of
the
tribes
must
result
from
casualty
and
accident
this
was
undoubtedly
true
but
it
did
not
in
all
probability
occur
to
the
indians
that
it
was
a
good
and

for
their

of
turning

with

there
are
some
notable

is
estimated
to
contain
some

of

absurdity
of
the
statement
that
lands
which
are
absolutely
necessary
for
white
farmers
are
comparatively
valueless
to
indians
whom
the
government
is
theoretically
making
every
effort
to
train
into
farmers
and
who
have
for
the

ten
years
made
appreciable
progress
in

direction

adds
with
respect
to
its
being
valuable
to
the

it
is
more
so
for
the
purpose
of
making
room
for
our
emigrating
citizens
than
for
any
other
and
only
a
small
part
of
it
is
now
actually
necessary
for
that
object
the
extent
of
the
proposed
cession
should
be
no
criterion
of
the
amount
that
should
be
paid
for
it
on
a
full
consideration
of
the
whole
matter
it
is
the
opinion
of
this
office
that
from
two
to

half
cents
an
acre
would
be
an
ample
equivalent
for
it
some
discretion
is
left
to
the
commissioners
as
to
giving
more
than
this
if
the
indians
are
not
satisfied

any
such
increase
of
price
must
be
based
on

evidence

chrysostom

of
this
apparent
niggardliness
on
the
part
of
the

it
is
not
selfishness
at
all
it
is
the
purest
of
philanthropy
the
government
has
all
along
been
suffering
in
mind
from
two
conflicting
the
desire
to
give
these
indians
an
equivalent
for
their
possessions
and
on
the
other
hand
the
fact
that
no
greater
curse
can
be
inflicted
on
a
tribe
so
little
civilized
as
the
sioux
than
to
have
large
sums

says

matter
of
humanity
and
duty
toward
this
helpless
race
to
make
every
exertion
in
our
power
not
to
place
much
money
at

discretion
the
government
is
beginning
very
well

direction

must
be
admitted
when
it
proposes
to

for

hardly
do

that

can
not

philanthropy

the
withholding

which
the

be
expended
annually
as
the
president
might
direct
and
which
was
not
expended
at
all
because
president
after
president
directed
that
it
should
be
applied
to
educational
purposes
and
there
being
no
evident
and
easy
way
of

it
in

it
does
from

advantages
it
was
evidently
very
cheap
at
two
and
a
half
cents
an
acre
in
this
same
code
of
instructions
by
the
indian
bureau
there
is
a
record
of
another
instance
of
the
government
disregard
of
treaty
stipulations
at
the
time
of
the
treaty
of
prairie
du
chien
in
the
sioux
chiefs
had
requested
that
a
certain
tract
be
set
apart
and
bestowed
upon
the
of
their
nation
this
was
provided
for
in
the
ninth
article
of
that
treaty
but
the
government
refused
to
give
to
the
any
title
to
this
land
except
in
the
same
manner
as
other
indian
titles
are
held
it
was
agreed
however
that
the
president
might
assign
to
any
of
said
to
be
held
by
him
or
them
in
any
portion
of
said
tract
not
exceeding
a
section
of
six
hundred
and
forty
acres
to
an
individual
this
tract
of
land
was
known
as
the
reservation
on
lake
tepin
the
had
made
almost
unintermitting
efforts
to
have
these
assignments
made
but
the
government
had
as
constantly
refused
to
do
it
the
indian
bureau
now
assigns
two
reasons
why
this
treaty
stipulation
was
never
fulfilled
that
the
or
most
of
them
would
be
speculated
upon
by
designing
persons
and
cheated
out
of
their
reservations
that
on
account
of
the
quality
of
the
lands
some
would
necessarily
have
much
better
reservations
than
others
which
would
engender
dissatisfaction
and
among
themselves
as
well
as
against
the
united
states
the
bureau
felicitates
itself
that
the
only
title
they
now
have
to
this
land
therefore
is
that
by
which
other
indians
hold
their
lands
the
occupant
or
usufruct
right
and
this
they
enjoy
by
the
permission
of
the
united
states
such
being
the
case
and
as
the
government
would
probably
never
find
it
expedient
and
advisable
to
make
the
assignment
referred
to
this
tract
whatever
may
be
the
character
of
the
land
must
be
and
would
continue
comparatively
worthless
to
them
nevertheless
it
appears
that
in
one
of
the
three
treaties
made
with
the
sioux
but
not
ratified
was
with
these
very
for
this
same
valueless
tract
of
acres
of
land
that
they
were
to
be
paid
for
it
and
also
to
be
paid
for
all
the
improvements
they
had
made
on
it
and
that
the
treaty
commissioners
are
still
instructed
to
allow
them
for
it
now
whatever
sum
the
commissioners
deem
it
to
be
fairly
worth
under
no
circumstances
however
to
exceed
the
sum
stipulated
in
putting
this
all
into
plain
english
it
simply
means
that
in
the
government
promised
to
let
a
band
of
men
take
out
tracts
of
land
in
and
settle
down
like
other
men
on
their
homesteads
that
for
ten
years
the
men
begged
to
do
so
and
were
refused
that
at
the
end
of
ten
years
thinking
there
was
no
hope
of
anything
better
they
agreed
to
sell
the
whole
tract
back
to
the
government
for
that
this
bargain
also
the
government
did
not
fulfil
the
treaties
never
being
ratified
and
nine
years
later
was
found
congratulating
itself
on
the
fact
that
by
reason
of
all
these
unfulfilled
agreements
the
land
was
still
held
only
in
the
same
manner
as
other
indian
titles
are
held
not
held
at
used
on
sufferance
of
the
government
and
could
be
taken
possession
of
at
any
time
at
the
government
pleasure
this
matter
was
supposed
to
be
finally
settled
in
by
a
law
of
congress
but
in
the
thing
appears
to
have
been
still
unsettled
a
commission
had
been
sent
out
to
investigate
it
and
the
report
was
that
the
subject
has
been
one
of
some
difficulty
and
intricacy
but
the
final
report
of
the
commissioners
has
just
been
received
and
steps
will
be
taken
at
once
to
cause
the
scrip
to
issue
to
the
parties
entitled
thereto
a
little
farther

in
this
same
notable
document
is
a
mention
of
another
tract
of
which
it
is
now
desirable
to
extinguish
the
title

was
set
apart

tenth
article
of
that
same
old
treaty
for
the
of
the
omahas
otoes
iowas
and
yankton
and
santee
sioux
this
contains
about
acres
but
is
supposed
to
be
of
much
less
value
than
that
on
lake
tepin
much
less
value
than
but
the
amount
to
be
paid
for
it
is
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
commissioners
at
this
time
the
bands
of
the
medewakanton
sioux
were
occupying
a
tract
of
over
two
hundred
miles
along
the
west
shore
of
the
mississippi
reaching
also
some
miles
up
the
peter
the
yanktons
santees
and
other
bands
lived
high
up
the
peter
reaching
over
into
the
lands
west
of
the
missouri
out
of
reach
of
ordinary
facilities
of
intercourse
these
bands
were
often
in
great
distress
for
food
owing
to
the
failure
of
the
buffalo
they
never
lost
an
occasion
to
send
imploring
messages
to
the
great
father
urging
him
to
help
them

particularly
ask
for
hoes

they
may
plant

indians
says
the
views
of
most
of
those
who
have
lived
the
longest
among
the
indians
agree
in
one
is
that
no
great
or
beneficial
change
can
take
place
in
their
condition
until
the
general
government
has
made
them
amenable
to

and
secure

simple
and
necessary
step

their
farms
or
at
least
hoes
did
the
united
states
government
keep
on
and
on
in
its
obstinate
way
feeding
the
indian
in
gross
and
reckless
improvidence
with
one
hand
plundering
him
with
the
other
and
holding
him
steadily
down
at
the
level
of
his
own
barbarism
nay
forcing
him
below
it
by
the
newly
added
vices
of
gambling
and
drunkenness
and
yet
all
the
while
boasting
of
its
desire
to
enlighten
instruct

civilize

it
is
as
inexplicable
as
it
is

phenomenal
thing

the
history
of

were
made

upper
and
lower
bands
of
sioux
being
treated
with
separately
at
traverse
de
sioux
and
at
mendota
the
upper
bands
were
soon
disposed
of
though
some
few
of
them
having
been
taught
to
read
had
become
impressed
with
the
idea
that
their
country
was
of
immense
value
and
at
first
demanded
six
million
dollars
for
the
lands
to
be
ceded
the
treaty
with
the
lower
medawakantons
and
exceedingly
difficult
of
attainment
on
account
of
firstly
their
proximity
to
the
flourishing
settlements
on
the
east
side
of
the
mississippi
producing
necessarily
frequent
contact
with
the
whites
whose
ideas
of
the
great
value
of
the
country
had
been
imparted
to
these
indians
secondly
their
great
experience
in
indian
diplomacy
being
in
the
enjoyment
already
of
liberal
annuities
under
former
stipulations
these
things
rendered
them
as
indifferent
to
the
making
of
another
treaty
at
present
as
the
whites
on
their
borders
were
anxious
that
their
lands
should
be
acquired
in
consequence
of
this
indomitable
on
the
part
of
the
indians
the
sessions
of
the
commissioners
were
tedious
and
long
not
until
a
month
had
passed
did
they
prevail
on
these
indians
to
sign
away
the
coveted
lands
the
of
the
mississippi
valley
and
they
were
obliged
to
more
than
treble
the
number
of
cents
per
acre
which
they
had
been
instructed
to
pay
for
millions
of
acres
of
land
they
agreed
to
pay
nominally
which
would
be
between
eight
and
nine
cents
an
acre
but
as
was
to
be
held
in
trust
and
only
the
interest
at
five
per
cent
to
be
paid
to
the
indians
and
this
only
for
the
term
of
fifty
years
at
which
time
the
principal
was
to
revert
to
the
government
it
will
be
easily
reckoned
that
the
indians
would
receive
all
told
only
about
six
and
cents
an
acre
and
taking
into
account
the
great
value
of
the
relinquished
lands
and
the
price
the
government
would
undoubtedly
obtain
for
them
it
will
be
readily
conceded
that
governor
ramsey
was
not
too
sanguine
when
he
stated
in
his
report
to
the
interior
department
that
the
actual
cost
to
the
government
of
this
magnificent
purchase
is
only
the
sum
paid
in
hand
the
governor
says
that
it
was
by
no
means
the
purpose
of
the
commission
to
act
other
than
justly
and
generously
toward
the
indians
that
a
continuation
of
the
payment
of
large
sums
of
interest
annually
would
do
them
no
further
good
after
fifty
years
had
expired
and
would
be
inconsistent
with
sound
governmental
policy
he
says
that
the
dakota
nation
although
warlike
is
friendly
to
the
whites
and
that
it
may
be
reasonably
expected
that
by
a
judicious
expenditure
of
the
civilization
and
improvement
funds
provided
for
in
these
treaties
they
will
soon
take
the
lead
in
agriculture
and
other
industrial
pursuits
one
of
the
provisions
of
this
treaty
forbade
the
introduction
of
ardent
spirits
into
the
new
reservation
this
was
put
in
in
accordance
with
the
earnest
desire
of
the
chiefs
who
requested
that
some
stringent
measures
should
be
taken
by
the
government
to
exclude
all
kinds
of
liquors
from
their
new
home
by
this
treaty
the
four
great
bands
of
minnesota
sioux
were
all
to
be
consolidated
together
on
one
reservation
in
the
upper
part
of
the
mississippi
valley
this
region
was
thought
to
be
sufficiently
remote
to
guarantee
them
against
any
pressure
from
the
white
population
for
many
years
to
come
farms
were
to
be
opened
for
them
mills
and
schools
to
be
established
and
erected
they
were
to
have
now
a
chance
to
own
that
domestic
country
called
home
with
all
the
living
sympathies
and
all
the
future
hopes
and
projects
which
people
it
from
this
time
a
new
era
was
to
be
dated
in
the
history
of
the
dakotas
an
era
full
of
brilliant
promise
the
tract
of
territory
relinquished
by
them
was
larger
than
the
state
of
new
york
fertile
and
beautiful
beyond
description
far
the
best
part
of
minnesota
it
is
so
far
diversified
in
natural
advantages
that
its
productive
powers
may
be
considered
almost
inexhaustible
probably
no
tract
on
the
surface
of
the
globe
is
equally
well
watered
a
large
part
is
rich
arable
land
portions
are
of
unsurpassed
fertility
and
eminently
adapted
to
the
production
in
incalculable
quantities
of
the
cereal
grains
the
boundless
plains
present
inexhaustible
fields
of
pasturage
and
the
river
bottoms
are
richer
than
the
banks
of
the
nile
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
there
is
every
indication
of
extensive
mineral
fields
it
would
seem
that
the
assertion
made
only
a
few
lines
before
this
glowing
to
the
indians
themselves
the
broad
regions
which
have
been
ceded
are
of
inconsiderable
value
not
be
true
it
would
seem
that
for
eight
thousand
people
who
according
to
this
same
writer
have
outlived
in
a
great
degree
the
means
of
subsistence
of
the
hunter
state
and
must
very
soon
resort
to
the
pursuits
of
agriculture
nothing
could
have
been
more
fortunate
than
to
have
owned
and
occupied
millions
of
acres
of
just
such
land
as
this
they
appear
to
be
giving
already
some
evidence
of
a
disposition
to
turn
this
land
to
account
the
reports
from
the
different
farms
and
schools
show
progress
in
farming
industry
and
also
in
study
the
farming
is
carried
on
with
difficulty
because
there
are
only
a
few
carts
and
ploughs
which
must
be
used
in
turn
by
the
different
farmers
and
therefore
must
come
to
some
quite
too
late
to
be
of
use
and
there
is
much
quarrelling
among
them
owing
to
this
trouble
nevertheless
these
bands
have
raised
over
four
thousand
bushels
of
corn
in
the
year
there
is
also
a
great
opposition
to
the
schools
because
the
indians
have
been
told
that
the
accumulated
fifty
thousand
dollars
which
is
due
to
them
would
be
paid
to
them
in
cash
if
it
were
not
for
the
schools
nevertheless
education
is
slowly
progressing
in
this
year
fifty
copies
of
a
little
missionary
paper
called
dakota
were
subscribed
for
in
the
one
mission
station
of
lac
qui
parle
and
sixty
scholars
were
enrolled
at
the
school
the
blacksmith
at
peter
reports
that
he
has
made
during
the
year
pieces
of
one
sort
and
another
for
the
indians
and
repaired
more
evidently
a
community
keeping
blacksmiths
so
busy
as
this
are
by
no
means
wholly
idle
themselves
it
is
worth
while
to
dwell
upon
these
seemingly
trivial
details
at
this
point
in
the
history
of
the
minnesota
sioux
because
they
are
all
significant
to
mark
the
point
in
civilization
they
had
already
reached
and
the
disposition
they
had
already
shown
toward
industry
before
they
were
obliged
to
submit
to
their
first
great
removal
their
condition
at
the
end
of
two
years
from
the
ratification
of
these
treaties
is
curtly
told
in
the
official
reports
of
the
indian
bureau
the
present
situation
of
that
portion
of
the
sioux
indians
parties
to
the
treaties
of
july
and
august
is
peculiar
unfortunate
and
to
them
must
prove
extremely
injurious
by
these
treaties
they
reluctantly
parted
with
a
very
large
extent
of
valuable
country
which
it
was
of
the
greatest
importance
to
the
government
to
acquire
an
insignificant
portion
of
it
near
its
western
boundary
not
deemed
necessary
or
desirable
for
a
white
population
for
many
years
if
at
all
was
agreed
to
be
reserved
and
assigned
to
them
for
their
future
residence
the
senate
amended
the
treaties
striking
out
this
provision
allowing
ten
cents
an
acre
in
lieu
of
the
reservations
and
requiring
the
president
with
the
assent
of
the
indians
if
they
agreed
to
the
amendments
to
assign
them
such
tracts
of
country
beyond
the
limits
of
that
ceded
as
might
be
satisfactory
for
their
future
home
to
the
amendments
was
appended
a
proviso
the
president
may
by
the
consent
of
the
indians
vary
the
conditions
aforesaid
if
deemed
expedient
the
indians
were
induced
to
agree
to
the
amendments
in
the
justice
liberality
and
humanity
of
the
president
and
the
congress
of
the
united
states
that
such
tracts
of
country
will
be
set
apart
for
their
future
occupancy
and
home
as
will
be
to
them
acceptable
and
satisfactory
thus
not
only
was
the
assent
of
the
indians
made
necessary
to
a
country
being
assigned
to
them
without
the
limits
of
that
ceded
but
by
the
authority
given
to
the
president
to
vary
the
conditions
of
the
amendments
to
the
treaties
he
was
empowered
with
the
consent
of
the
indians
to
place
them
upon
the
designated
reservations
or
upon
any
other
portion
of
the
ceded
territory
deemed
expedient
to
avoid
collisions
and
difficulties
between
the
indians
and
the
white
population
which
rapidly
commenced
pouring
into
the
ceded
country
it
became
necessary
that
the
former
should
vacate
at
least
a
large
portion
of
it
without
delay
while
there
was
neither
the
time
nor
the
means
to
make
the
requisite
explorations
to
find
a
suitable
location
for
them
beyond
the
limits
of
the
cession
under
these
pressing
and
embarrassing
circumstances
the
late
president
determined
to
permit
them
to
remain
five
years
on
the
designated
reservations
if
they
were
willing
to
accept
this
alternative
they
assented
and
many
of
them
have
been
already
removed
however
unavoidable
this
arrangement
it
is
a
most
unfortunate
one
the
indians
are
fully
aware
of
its
temporary
character
and
of
the
uncertainty
as
to
their
future
position
and
will
consequently
be
disinclined
and
deterred
from
any
efforts
to
make
themselves
comfortable
and
improve
their
condition
the
inevitable
result
must
be
that
at
the
end
of
the
time
limited
they
will
be
in
a
far
worse
condition
than
now
and
the
efforts
and
expenditures
of
years
to
infuse
into
them
a
spirit
of
improvement
will
all
have
been
in
vain
the
large
investments
in
mills
farms
mechanic
shops
and
other
improvements
required
by
the
treaties
to
be
made
for
their
benefit
will
be
entirely
wasted
if
the
indians
are
to
remain
on
their
reservations
only
during
the
prescribed
five
years
at
the
very
period
when
they
would
begin
to
reap
the
full
advantage
of
these
beneficial
provisions
they
would
have
to
remove
another
unfortunate
feature
of
this
arrangement
if
temporary
is
that
the
indians
will
have
expended
the
considerable
sums
set
apart
in
the
treaties
for
the
expenses
of
their
removal
to
a
permanent
home
and
for
subsistence
until
they
could
otherwise
provide
it
leaving
nothing
for
these
important
and
necessary
purposes
in
the
event
of
another
emigration
in
view
of
these
facts
and
considerations
no
time
should
be
lost
in
determining
upon
some
final
and
permanent
arrangement
in
regard
to
them
the
governor
of
minnesota
also
writes
at
this
time
the
doubtful
tenure
by
which
this
tribe
hold
their
supposed
reservation
is
well
understood
by
their
chiefs
and
headmen
and
is
beginning
to
give
deep
dissatisfaction
and
throwing
daily
more
and
more
obstacles
in
the
way
of
their
removal
this
reservation
will
not
be
wanted
for
white
men
for
many
years
there
is
not
wood
or
timber
or
coal
sufficient
for
the
purposes
of
civilization
except
immediately
on
the
peter
and
its
tributaries
from
near
the
vicinity
of
the
new
agency
there
commences
a
vast
prairie
of
more
than
one
hundred
miles
in
extent
entirely
destitute
of
timber
and
i
feel
confident
that
we
never
shall
be
able
to
keep
any
very
large
number
of
them
at
their
new
agency
or
near
there
already
the
fund
set
apart
for
the
removal
and
subsistence
the
first
year
of
the
sissetons
and
has
been
expended
and
all
their
provisions
eaten
up
seventeen
thousand
dollars
and
upward
have
been
expended
by
governor
ramsey
and
one
year
in
advance
of
the
time
fixed
by
the
treaty
for
their
removal
this
expenditure
was
made
while
he
was
getting
them
to
sign
the
senate
amendments
to
the
treaty
of
which
they
were
very
reluctant
to
do
and
which
not
more
than
half
the
chiefs
have
signed
these
indians
want
the
government
to
confirm
this
reservation
to
them
i
would
recommend
that
this
be
done
as
the
only
means
to
satisfy
them
and
humanity
demands
it
here
is
a
picture
of
a
helpless
people
forced
to
give
up
the
of
the
state
and
accept
in
its
stead
an
insignificant
tract
on
the
greater
part
of
which
there
is
not
wood
or
timber
or
coal
sufficient
for
civilization
and
then
before
the
ink
of
this
treaty
is
dry
told
that
even
from
this
insignificant
tract
they
must
promise
to
move
at
the
end
of
five
years
what
words
could
characterize
such
a
transaction
between
man
and
man
there
is
not
a
country
a
people
a
community
in
which
it
would
be
even
attempted
was
it
less
base
or
more
being
between
a
strong
government
and
a
feeble
race
from
the
infamy
of
accomplishing
this
purpose
the
united
states
was
saved
remonstrances
and
still
more
the
resistance
of
the
indians
prevailed
and
in
we
find
the
poor
creatures
expressing
much
satisfaction
that
the
president
has
decreed
that
they
are
to
remain
permanently
on
their
insignificant
tract
the
upper
missouri
sioux
are
still
suffering
and
destitute
a
few
of
them
cultivating
little
patches
of
ground
depending
chiefly
on
the
chase
and
on
roots
and
wild
berries
when
these
resources
fail
there
is
nothing
left
for
them
but
to
starve
or
to
commit
depredations
on
white
settlers
some
of
the
bands
nevertheless
have
scrupulously
observed
the
stipulations
of
the
fort
laramie
treaty
in
show
a
strong
desire
for
improvement
and
are
on
the
most
friendly
terms
with
the
whites
these
peaceable
and
friendly
bands
are
much
distressed
as
well
they
may
be
at
the
reckless
course
pursued
by
others
of
their
tribe
they
welcome
the
presence
of
the
soldiers
sent
to
chastise
the
offenders
and
gladly
render
all
the
service
to
them
they
can
even
against
their
relatives
and
friends
in
it
is
stated
that
various
causes
have
combined
to
prevent
the
minnesota
sioux
from
deriving
heretofore
much
substantial
benefit
from
the
very
liberal
provisions
of
the
treaties
of
until
after
the
reservations
were
permanently
assured
to
the
indians
it
would
have
been
highly
improper
to
have
made
the
expenditures
for
permanent
improvements
and
since
then
the
affairs
of
the
agency
have
not
been
free
from
confusion
large
sums
of
money
have
been
expended
for
these
sioux
but
they
have
been
indolent
extravagant
intemperate
and
have
wasted
their
means
without
improving
or
seeming
to
desire
to
improve
their
condition
both
these
statements
are
made
in
grave
good
faith
certainly
without
any
consciousness
of
their
bearing
on
each
other
it
is
not
stated
however
what
specific
means
the
sioux
could
have
employed
to
improve
their
condition
had
they
desired
to
do
so
the
summer
of
was
one
which
will
long
be
remembered
by
the
citizens
of
minnesota
it
was
opened
by
terrible
massacres
which
were
all
the
work
of
a
strolling
outcast
band
of
sioux
not
more
than
fifteen
in
number
they
had
been
driven
out
of
their
tribe
some
sixteen
years
previous
and
had
been
ever
since
then
leading
a
wandering
and
marauding
life
the
beginning
of
the
trouble
was
a
trivial
difficulty
between
one
of
the
white
settlers
on
rock
river
and
an
indian
the
settler
dog
bit
the
indian
and
the
indian
shot
the
dog
for
this
the
white
settlers
beat
the
indian
severely
and
then
went
to
the
camp
and
by
force
took
away
all
the
guns
of
the
band
this
was
at
a
season
of
the
year
when
to
be
without
guns
meant
simply
to
be
without
food
and
the
indians
were
reduced
at
once
to
a
condition
of
great
suffering
by
some
means
they
either
repossessed
themselves
of
their
guns
or
procured
others
and
attacking
the
settlement
killed
all
the
inhabitants
except
four
women
whom
they
carried
away
with
them
and
treated
with
the
utmost
barbarity
the
inevitable
results
of
such
horrors
followed
the
thousands
of
peaceable
indians
in
minnesota
who
did
not
even
know
of
this
outrage
were
all
held
in
one
common
terror
and
hatred
by
the
general
public
only
the
very
great
firmness
and
discretion
of
the
military
officers
sent
to
deal
with
the
outbreak
saved
minnesota
from
a
general
uprising
and
attack
from
all
the
sioux
bands
who
were
already
in
a
state
of
smouldering
discontent
by
reason
of
the
of
their
annuities
however
they
obeyed
the
demands
of
the
government
that
they
themselves
should
pursue
this
offending
band
and
either
capture
or
exterminate
it
they
killed
four
and
took
three
prisoners
and
then
returned
much
jaded
and
worn
and
said
they
could
do
no
more
without
the
help
of
united
states
soldiers
and
that
they
thought
they
had
now
done
enough
to
show
their
loyalty
and
to
deserve
the
payment
of
their
annuities
one
of
the
chiefs
said
the
man
who
killed
white
people
did
not
belong
to
us
and
we
did
not
expect
to
be
called
to
account
for
the
people
of
another
band
we
have
always
tried
to
do
as
our
great
father
tells
us
another
said
i
am
going
to
speak
of
the
treaty
for
fifty
years
we
were
to
be
paid
per
annum
we
were
also
promised
that
we
have
not
seen
i
wish
to
say
to
my
great
father
we
were
promised
these
things
but
have
not
seen
them
yet
why
does
not
the
great
father
do
as
he
promised
these
hostilities
were
speedily
brought
to
an
end
yet
the
situation
was
by
no
means
reassuring
for
the
indians
but
one
sentiment
seemed
to
inspire
the
whole
white
population
and
this
was
the
desire
to
exterminate
the
entire
indian
race
for
the
present
writes
the
superintendent
it
is
equally
important
to
protect
the
indians
from
the
whites
as
the
whites
from
the
indians
and
this
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
all
the
leading
bands
of
the
treaty
sioux
had
contributed
warriors
to
go
in
pursuit
of
the
murderers
had
killed
or
captured
all
they
could
find
and
stood
ready
to
go
again
after
the
remaining
eight
if
the
united
states
troops
would
go
also
and
assist
them
spite
of
the
exertions
of
one
of
the
chiefs
of
the
lower
sioux
little
crow
who
the
superintendent
says
labored
with
him
night
and
day
in
organizing
the
party
riding
continually
between
the
lower
and
upper
agencies
so
that
they
scarcely
slept
till
the
had
set
out
on
the
track
of
the
murderers
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
whole
body
of
the
sioux
without
exception
received
the
intelligence
with
as
much
indignation
and
disapprobation
as
the
whites
themselves
and
did
their
best
to
stand
clear
of
any
suspicion
of
or
connection
with
the
of
all
this
they
were
in
continual
danger
of
being
shot
at
sight
by
the
terrified
and
unreasoning
settlers
one
band
under
the
chief
sleepy
eyes
were
returning
to
their
homes
from
a
hunt
and
while
they
were
wondering
what
the
panic
among
the
whites
meant
they
having
heard
nothing
of
the
massacre
were
fired
into
by
some
of
the
militia
volunteers
the
next
day
a
white
settler
was
found
killed
near
that
by
some
member
of
sleepy
eyes
band
this
excitement
slowly
abated
and
for
the
next
four
years
a
steady
improvement
was
visible
in
the
minnesota
sioux
hundreds
of
them
threw
aside
the
distinctive
badge
of
their
wild
state
schools
were
well
attended
and
farms
were
well
tilled
that
there
was
great
hostility
to
this
civilization
on
the
part
of
the
majority
of
the
tribe
can
not
be
denied
but
that
was
only
inevitable
protest
of
a
and
proud
race
against
abandoning
all
its
race
distinctions
when
we
see
the
men
of
lorraine
or
of
montenegro
ready
to
die
for
the
sake
merely
of
being
called
by
the
name
of
one
power
rather
than
by
that
of
another
we
find
it
heroic
and
give
them
our
sympathies
but
when
the
north
american
indian
is
ready
to
die
rather
than
wear
the
clothes
and
follow
the
ways
of
the
white
man
we
feel
for
him
only
unqualified
contempt
and
see
in
his
instinct
nothing
more
than
a
barbarian
incapacity
to
appreciate
civilization
is
this
just
in
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
visiting
these
sioux
reports
i
was
much
surprised
to
find
so
many
of
the
sioux
indians
wearing
the
garb
of
civilization
many
of
them
living
in
frame
or
brick
houses
some
of
them
with
stables
or
and
their
fields
indicating
considerable
knowledge
of
agriculture
their
condition
he
says
affords
abundant
evidence
of
what
may
be
accomplished
among
the
sioux
indians
by
steadily
adhering
to
a
uniform
undeviating
policy
the
number
that
live
by
agricultural
pursuits
is
yet
small
compared
with
the
whole
but
their
condition
is
so
much
better
than
that
of
the
wild
indian
that
they
too
are
becoming
convinced
that
it
is
the
better
way
to
live
and
many
are
coming
in
asking
to
have
their
hair
cut
and
for
a
suit
of
clothes
and
to
be
located
on
a
piece
of
land
where
they
can
build
a
house
and
fence
in
their
fields
many
more
of
them
would
have
entered
on
the
agricultural
life
had
the
government
provided
ways
and
means
for
them
to
do
so
in
this
same
report
is
a
mention
of
one
settlement
of
two
thousand
indians
at
big
stone
lake
who
have
been
hitherto
almost
entirely
neglected
these
people
complain
that
they
have
lived
upon
promises
for
the
last
ten
years
and
are
really
of
opinion
that
white
men
never
perform
what
they
promise
many
of
them
would
go
to
work
if
they
had
any
reasonable
encouragement
the
annuities
are
still
in
arrears
every
branch
of
the
industries
and
improvements
attempted
suffers
for
want
of
the
promised
funds
and
from
delays
in
payments
expected
the
worst
result
however
of
these
delays
in
the
fulfilment
of
treaty
stipulations
was
the
effect
on
the
indians
a
sense
of
wrong
in
the
past
and
distrust
for
the
future
was
ever
deepening
in
their
minds
and
preparing
them
to
be
suddenly
thrown
by
any
small
provocation
into
an
antagonism
and
hostility
grossly
disproportionate
to
the
apparent
cause
this
was
the
condition
of
the
minnesota
sioux
in
the
summer
of
footnote
see
appendix
art
vi
the
record
of
the
massacres
of
that
summer
is
scarcely
equalled
in
the
history
of
indian
wars
early
in
august
some
bands
of
the
upper
sioux
who
had
been
waiting
at
their
agency
nearly
two
months
for
their
annuity
payments
and
had
been
suffering
greatly
for
food
during
that
much
so
that
they
dug
up
roots
to
appease
their
hunger
and
when
corn
was
turned
out
to
them
they
devoured
it
uncooked
like
wild
animals
desperate
broke
into
the
government
warehouse
and
took
some
of
the
provisions
stored
there
this
was
the
real
beginning
of
the
outbreak
although
the
first
massacre
was
not
till
the
when
that
began
the
friendly
indians
were
powerless
to
fact
they
were
threatened
with
their
lives
if
they
did
not
join
nevertheless
some
of
them
rescued
whole
families
and
carried
them
to
places
of
safety
others
sheltered
and
fed
women
and
children
in
their
own
lodges
many
fled
leaving
all
their
possessions
much
victims
of
the
outbreak
as
the
minnesota
people
themselves
for
three
days
the
hostile
bands
continually
went
from
settlement
to
settlement
killing
and
plundering
a
belt
of
country
nearly
two
hundred
miles
in
length
and
about
fifty
in
width
was
entirely
abandoned
by
the
population
who
flocked
in
panic
to
the
towns
and
forts
nearly
a
thousand
were
women
and
nameless
outrages
were
committed
on
many
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
property
were
destroyed
the
outbreak
was
quickly
quelled
by
military
force
and
a
large
number
of
indians
captured
many
voluntarily
surrendered
bringing
with
them
over
two
hundred
whites
that
they
had
taken
prisoners
a
military
commission
tried
these
indians
and
sentenced
over
three
hundred
to
be
hung
all
but
were
reprieved
and
put
into
prison
the
remainder
were
moved
to
dakota
to
a
barren
desert
where
for
three
years
they
endured
sufferings
far
worse
than
death
the
remainder
escaped
to
the
upper
missouri
region
or
to
canada
footnote
all
the
winnebagoes

the

minnesota
at
a
terrible
cost
to
herself
and
to
the
united
states
government
was
at
last
free
from
the
presence
of
indians
within
her
who
were
her
enemies
only
because
they
had
been
treated
with
injustice

became

through
all
the
troubles
fifty
of
these
yankton
sioux
had
been
organized
by
general
sibley
into
a
company
of
scouts
and
had
proved
more
effective
than
twice
the
number
of
white
soldiers
the
only
cost
to
the
government
of
this
service
on
the
part
of
the
yanktons
had
been
fifty
suits
of
condemned
artillery
uniforms
arms
and
rations
in
part

the
scouts
themselves
in
the
government
having
spent
about
on
these
campaigns
began
to
cast
about
for
cheaper
if
not
more
humane
methods
and
partly
at
the
instance
of
the
governor
of
dakota
who
knew
very
well
that
the
indians
desired
peace
sent
out
a
commission
to
treat
with
them
there
were
now
all
told
some
sioux
in
this
region
nearly
being
the
refugees
from
minnesota
the
report
of
this
commission
is
full
of
significant
statements
there
seems
to
be
no
doubt
that
the
great
majority
of
the
indians
are
anxious
for
peace
but
they
are
afraid
to
meet
the
agents
of
the
government
lest
they
be
in
some
way
betrayed
such
bands
as
are
represented
however
gladly
assent
to
a
treaty
of
peace
and
the
commissioners
speak
with
great
feeling
of
the
condition
of
the
loyal
yanktons
no
improvements
have
been
made
on
their
lands
and
the
commissioners
were
obliged
to
issue
provisions
to
them
to
keep
them
from
starving
no
crops
met
the
eye
nor
is
there
the
semblance
of
a
yet
by
article
four
of
the
treaty
with
the
yankton
sioux
the
united
states
government
had
agreed
to
expend
in
erecting
a
suitable
building
or
buildings
and
to
establish
and
maintain
one
or
more
normal
labor
schools
and
it
is
to
be
read
in
the
united

statutes
at

that
in

of
the
years
and
congress
appropriated
as
per
treaty
for
the
benefit
of
the
yankton
sioux
with
the
exception
of
a
few
miserable
huts
a
and
a
small
amount
of
land
enclosed
there
are
few
vestiges
of
improvement
they
are
reduced
to
the
necessity
of
hunting
for
a
living
and
unless
soon
reassured
and
encouraged
they
will
be
driven
to
despair
and
the
great
discontent
existing
among
them
will
culminate
in
another
formidable
indian
war
nine
treaties
were
concluded
by
this
commission
with
as
many
different
bands
of
sioux
the
indians
pledging
themselves
to
abstain
from
all
hostilities
with
each
other
and
with
the
whites
and
the
government
agreeing
to
pay
to
the
indians
fifteen
dollars
a
head
per
annum
and
to
all
who
will
settle
down
to
farming
dollars
a
head
in
the
winter
following
these
treaties
all
these
indians
faithfully
kept
their
promises
in
spite
of
terrible
sufferings
from
cold
and
from
lack
of
food
some
of
them
were
at
the
old
crow
creek
reservation
in
dakota
where
they
were
kept
from
absolute
starvation
only
by
the
issue
to
them
of
such
scanty
supplies
as
could
be
spared
from
the
stores
at
fort
sully
and
from
the
agency
it
is
much
to
the
credit
of
these
indians
that
in
spite
of
their
manifold
sufferings
scarcely
a
case
of
stealing
occurred
among
them
they
being
determined
to
keep
their
faith
to
the
government
they
will
run
like
chickens
to
gather
the
offal
from
the
slop
buckets
that
are
carried
from
the
garrison
kitchens
while
they
pass
a
pile
of
corn
and
hundreds
of
loose
cattle
without
touching
a
thing
except
when
told
they
may
gather
up
the
grains
of
corn
from
the
ground
where
the
rats
in
their
depredations
have
let
it
fall
from
the
sacks
says
the
report
of
one
of
the
commissioners
in
the
summer
of
still
further
treaties
were
concluded
with
the
indians
of
the
plains
and
all
the
sioux
with
the
exception
of
those
in
the
british
possessions
were
now
pledged
to
peace
this
summer
also
saw
the
first
recognition
on
the
part
of
the
government
of
its
flagrant
injustice
toward
the
friendly
minnesota
sioux
who
were
moved
to
crow
creek
dakota
at
the
time
of
the
massacre
there
were
nearly
one
thousand
of
old
men
women
and
of
them
the
widows
and
children
of
those
who
had
been
hung
or
were
in
prison
at
davenport
for
three
years
they
had
been
quiet
and
patient
in
their
sufferings
the
two
hundred
prisoners
in
davenport
had
also
shown
an
excellent
disposition
and
entire
submission
although
many
of
them
were
known
and
proved
to
have
been
absolutely
guiltless
of
any
acts
of
hostility
and
not
only
this
but
deserving
of
reward
for
the
rescue
of
white
captives
certificates
petitions
and
letters
showing
these
facts
were
forwarded
from
iowa
to
the
department
but
the
commissioner
says
in
his
report
for
that
they
have
been
mislaid
in
their
passage
through
the
various
departments
and
can
not
be
found
there
was
still
another
class
of
these
indians
deserving
of
help
from
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
friendly
farmer
indians
who
were
living
in
quietly
on
their
farms
who
have
acted
as
scouts
for
the
government
who
never
committed
any
acts
of
hostility
nor
fled
with
those
who
did
commit
them
and
have
still
remained
friendly
through
these
four
years
while
compelled
to
a
vagabond
life
by
the
indiscriminate
confiscation
of
all
their
land
and
property
the
crops
belonging
to
these
farmer
indians
were
valued
at
and
they
had
large
herds
of
stock
of
all
kinds
fine
farms
and
improvements
the
united
states
troops
engaged
in
suppressing
the
massacre
also
the
prisoners
taken
by
all
some
for
fifty
days
on
this
property
strong
efforts
were
made
by
bishop
whipple
and
others
to
obtain
from
the
government
some
aid
for
these
friendly
indians
and
the
sum
of
was
appropriated
by
congress
for
that
purpose
the
letter
of
bishop
whipple
who
was
requested
to
report
on
the
division
of
this
sum
is
so
eloquent
a
summing
up
of
the
case
of
these
indians
that
it
ought
to
be
placed
on
permanent
record
in
the
history
of
our
country
he
writes
there
is
positive
injustice
in
the
appropriation
of
so
miserable
a
pittance
a
much
larger
sum
would
not
pay
the
amount
which
we
honestly
owe
these
men
the
government
was
the
trustee
of
the
upper
and
lower
sioux
it
held
several
millions
of
dollars
for
their
joint
property
of
the
tribes
these
friendly
sioux
had
abandoned
their
wild
life
and
adopted
the
dress
habits
and
customs
of
civilization
and
in
doing
this
which
placed
them
in
open
opposition
to
the
traditions
of
their
tribes
they
were
pledged
the
protection
of
the
government
by
a
mistaken
policy
by
positive
neglect
to
provide
a
government
by
the
perversion
of
funds
due
them
for
the
sale
of
their
reservations
by
withholding
their
annuities
until
two
months
after
they
were
due
which
was
caused
by
the
use
of
a
part
of
these
funds
for
claims
by
permitting
other
causes
of
dissatisfaction
to
go
on
unheeded
we
provoked
the
hostility
of
the
wild
indians
and
it
went
on
until
it
ripened
in
massacre
these
farmer
indians
had
been
pledged
a
patent
for
their
farms
unless
we
violated
our
solemn
pledge
these
lands
were
theirs
by
a
title
as
valid
as
any
title
could
be
they
had
large
crops
sufficient
to
support
general
sibley
army
for
a
number
of
weeks
they
lost
all
they
stock
clothing
furniture
in
addition
to
this
they
were
deprived
of
their
share
in
these
annuities
and
for
four
years
have
lived
in
very
great
suffering
you
can
judge
whether
shall
be
deemed
a
just
reward
for
the
bravery
and
fidelity
of
men
who
at
the
risk
of
their
own
lives
were
instrumental
in
saving
white
captives
and
maintained
their
friendship
to
the
whites
footnote
two
thousand
five
hundred
of
the
seven
thousand
five
hundred
dollars
had
been
especially
set
aside
by
the
government
unjust
in
its
rewards
as
in
its
punishments

submit
to
you
sir

through
you

to
reach
all
who
fear
god
and
love
justice
whether
the
very
least
we
can
do
for
all
the
friendly
sioux
is
not
to
fulfil
the
pledges
we
made
years
ago
and
give
to
each
of
them
a
patent
of
eighty
acres
of
land
build
them
a
house
and
provide
them
cattle
seeds
and
implements
of
husbandry
in
all
these
sioux
were
removed
and
in
spite
of
the
protestations
of
the
nebraska
citizens
settled
on
reservations
on
the
niobrara
river
in
northern
nebraska
it
soon
became
evident
that
this
place
was
undesirable
for
a
reservation
both
on
account
of
its
previous
occupancy
by
the
whites
and
scarcity
of
timber
in
the
fall
they
removed
again
to
the
mouth
of
bazile
creek
temporary
buildings
were
again
erected
and
here
they
spent
the
winters
of
and
in
february
they
were
cheered
by
the
invitation
sent
their
chiefs
and
headmen
to
visit
washington
they
went
feeling
sure
that
they
should
get
a
home
for
themselves
and
people
all
they
got
was
a
promise
that
a
commission
should
be
sent
out
to
visit
them
the
next
year
they
were
told
however
to
move
to
breckenridge
on
the
west
bank
of
the
missouri
plant
crops
there
and
were
promised
that
if
they
liked
the
place
they
should
have
it
secured
to
them
as
a
permanent
home
accordingly
the
agency
buildings
were
once
more
removed
and
two
hundred
acres
of
land
were
planted
before
the
crops
were
harvested
the
commission
arrived
and
urged
the
indians
to
move
farther
up
the
missouri
the
indians
being
averse
to
this
however
they
were
allowed
to
remain
and
told
that
if
they
would
cultivate
the
soil
like
white
lands
in
government
would
assist
them
the
indians
gladly
consented
to
this
and
signed
a
treaty
to
that
effect
but
in
their
agent
writes
that
treaty
is
not
yet
ratified
and
instead
of
assistance
to
open
farms
their
appropriation
has
been
cut
down
one
half
after
paying
for
supplies
purchased
on
credit
last
year
it
is
entirely
insufficient
for
clothing
and
subsistence
and
leaves
nothing
for
opening
farms
procuring
cattle
etc
these
indians
only
five
years
previous
had
been
living
on
good
farms
and
had
worth
of
stock
implements
etc
no
wonder
their
agent
writes
leave
them
without
a
home
a
few
years
longer
and
you
offer
strong
inducements
for
them
to
become
idle
and
worthless
it
is
an
intricate
and
perplexing
task
to
attempt
now
to
follow
the
history
of
the
different
bands
of
the
sioux
tribe
through
all
their
changes
of
location
and
in
dakota
some
in
nebraska
and
some
on
the
upper
arkansas
with
the
hostile
cheyennes
and
treaties
one
summer
and
on
the
the
a
home
in
spring
and
ordered
off
it
before
the
time
more
and
more
hemmed
in
by
white
settlers
and
more
and
more
driven
out
of
their
buffalo
ranges
by
at
any
time
to
have
bodies
of
united
states
soldiers
swoop
down
on
them
and
punish
whole
bands
for
depredations
committed
by
a
handful
of
men
perhaps
of
a
totally
distinct
wonder
is
not
that
some
of
them
were
hostile
and
vindictive
but
that
any
of
them
remained
peaceable
and
friendly
bandied
about
from
civil
authorities
to
war
department
recommending
that
all
indians
not
on
fixed
reservations
be
considered
at
war
and
proceeded
against
accordingly
and
the
interior
department
neglecting
to
provide
them
with
fixed
reservations
or
to
define
or
enforce
the
boundaries
of
even
their
temporary
cheated
on
all
half
the
is
not
a
tribe
of
all
the
persecuted
tribes
of
indians
that
has
a
more
piteous
record
than
the
sioux
nevertheless
we
find
many
of
the
bands
in
advancing
in
civilization
in
the
yankton
band
nearly
one
hundred
children
are
in
school
and
eight
hundred
acres
of
land
are
under
cultivation
the
lower
yanktons
are
peaceful
and
quiet
although
they
are
near
the
brulés
who
are
always
roving
and
hostile
the
sissetons
and
wahpetons
who
were
by
a
treaty
of
placed
on
reservations
in
dakota
are
industrious
and
fast
advancing
in
agricultural
pursuits
four
schools
are
in
operation
among
them
the
yanktons
are
anxious
to
farm
and
state
that
the
government
has
promised
to
assist
and
teach
them
to
farm
that
they
are
and
have
been
ready
for
some
time
but
as
yet
the
agent
has
not
received
any
instructions
or
funds
to
permit
of
their
accomplishing
their
desire
two
events
important
in
the
history
of
the
sioux
tribe
happened
in
and
one
was
the
visit
of
a
delegation
of
chiefs
and
headmen
from
several
of
the
bands
under
the
leadership
of
the
chief
red
cloud
to
washington
philadelphia
and
new
york
they
had
thus
an
opportunity
of
relating
all
their
grievances
and
of
receiving
the
declarations
of
good
intentions
toward
them
red
cloud
after
his
return
home
became
an
ardent
and
determined
advocate
of
peace
and
loyalty
the
other
was
the
withdrawal
of
a
portion
of
the
santee
sioux
from
their
band
for
the
purpose
of
taking
up
farms
under
the
homestead
act
and
becoming
independent
citizens
the
story
of
this
experiment
and
the
manner
in
which
it
was
met
by
the
united
states
government
is
best
told
in
the
words
of
williamson
a
missionary
who
had
lived
years
among
them
and
who
pleaded
thus
warmly
for
them
in
a
letter
addressed
to
the
department
in
the
summer
of
several
considerations
have
influenced
the
dakotas
in
going
to
the
big
sioux
river
the
soil
and
climate
are
more
similar
to
that
to
which
they
have
been
accustomed
in
minnesota
their
former
home
than
is
that
of
their
reservation
on
the
missouri
feeling
that
they
were
men
capable
of
sustaining
themselves
if
a
fair
opportunity
is
afforded
them
they
felt
that
it
was
degrading
to
live
as
sinecures
and
pensioners
dependent
on
government
for
food
and
clothing
and
chiefly
a
desire
to
make
homes
for
their
families
where
they
could
be
subjected
to
and
protected
by
the
laws
of
the
united
states
the
same
as
all
other
men
are
this
they
thought
could
not
be
the
case
on
their
reservation
these
sioux
were
parties
to
the
treaties
made
in
by
which
they
and
other
bands
ceded
to
the
united
states
all
the
best
settled
parts
of
minnesota
west
of
the
mississippi
for
less
than
part
of
its
present
value
and
much
less
than
the
lands
were
worth
to
them
as
and
while
as
hunters
they
needed
no
protection
of
the
law
they
knew
that
as
agriculturists
they
could
not
live
without
it
and
they
positively
refused
to
sell
their
till
the
commissioner
of
the
united
states
promised
that
they
should
be
protected
in
their
persons
and
property
the
same
as
white
men
government
never
accorded
to
them
this
protection
which
in
the
view
of
the
indians
was
a
very
important
consideration
in
selling
the
lands
this
neglect
on
the
part
of
the
government
led
to
yearly
complaints
and
the
massacres
of
these
sioux
were
most
of
them
previous
to
the
war
living
in
comfortable
homes
with
farms
and
teams
and
were
receiving
by
annuity
provisions
either
in
money
or
the
equivalent
about
a
head
annually
from
interest
on
their
money
invested
in
the
bonds
of
the
government
these
indians
in
taking
up
their
new
homesteads
were
required
by
the
department
to
renounce
on
oath
all
claims
on
the
united
states
for
annuities
without
doubt
citizenship
of
the
united
states
the
protection
of
our
laws
is
worth
a
great
sum
but
is
it
wise
or
right
in
our
government
to
require
these
natives
of
the
country
to
purchase
at
a
price
of
several
thousands
of
dollars
that
which
is
given
without
money
or
price
to
every
immigrant
from
asia
europe
or
africa
that
asks
for
it
besides
their
annuities
there
is
due
them
from
the
government
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
of
their
old
reservation
on
the
minnesota
river
which
is
more
than
forty
miles
long
and
ten
wide
which
after
paying
expenses
of
survey
and
sale
are
according
to
a
law
of
the
united
states
to
be
expended
in
assisting
them
to
make
homes
elsewhere
and
as
these
lands
were
valued
at
an
acre
and
upward
and
are
rapidly
selling
the
portion
which
will
be
due
each
of
the
indians
can
not
be
less
than
or
for
each
family
the
oath
required
of
them
is
supposed
to
bar
them
from
any
claim
to
this
also
now
i
can
not
see
how
this
decision
of
the
indian
department
is
consistent
either
with
justice
or
good
policy
and
it
is
certainly
inconsistent
with
both
the
spirit
and
letter
of
articles
six
and
ten
of
a
treaty
between
the
united
states
of
america
and
different
bands
of
sioux
indians
concluded
in
and
ratified
and
proclaimed
february
what
i
ask
for
them
is
that
our
government
restore
to
them
a
part
of
what
we
took
from
them
and
give
them
the
same
chance
to
live
and
thrive
which
we
give
to
all
the
other
inhabitants
of
our
country
whether
white
or
black
that
some
aid
is
very
necessary
must
be
obvious
to
you
who
know
how
difficult
it
is
for
even
white
men
trained
to
work
and
with
several
hundred
dollars
in
property
to
open
a
new
farm
in
this
western
wilderness
their
number
is
probably
greater
than
you
are
aware
of
when
i
administered
the
lord
supper
there
on
the
first
sabbath
of
this
month
there
were
present
communicants
of
our
church
besides
quite
a
number
of
other
persons
it
is
owing
to
the
santee
to
those
on
the
big
sioux
river
chiefly
to
those
near
fort
in
the
last
five
years
not
a
single
white
inhabitant
of
minnesota
or
iowa
has
been
murdered
by
the
wild
indians
while
many
have
been
cut
off
in
every
frontier
state
and
territory
of
the
missouri
so
long
as
the
christian
sioux
can
be
kept
on
the
frontier
the
white
settlements
are
safe
in
conclusion
i
wish
again
to
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
these
indians
on
the
big
sioux
purchase
citizenship
at
a
very
great
sum
and
to
entreat
you
to
do
all
in
your
power
to
secure
for
them
that
protection
of
person
or
property
for
which
they
bargain
and
without
which
nothing
our
government
can
do
will
make
them
prosperous
or
happy
no
attention
was
paid
to
this
appeal
and
the
next
year
the
indefatigable
missionary
sent
a
still
stronger
one
setting
forth
that
this
colony
now
numbered
fifty
families
had
been
under
the
instruction
of
the
american
board
of
commissioners
for
foreign
missions
for
many
years
had
a
church
of
one
hundred
members
a
native
preacher
partly
supported
by
them
had
built
on
their
claims
and
planted
farms
many
of
them
digging
up
the
ground
with
hoes
and
spades
williamson
reiterates
the
treaty
provisions
under
which
he
claims
that
these
indians
are
entitled
to
aid
the
sixth
article
of
the
treaty
of
closes
as
follows
any
indian
or
indians
receiving
a
patent
for
land
under
the
foregoing
provisions
shall
thereby
and
henceforth
become
and
be
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
and
be
entitled
to
all
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
such
citizenship
and
shall
at
the
same
time
retain
all
his
rights
and
benefits
accruing
to
indians
under
this
treaty
this
treaty
goes
on
to
provide
most
liberally
for
all
indians
adopting
the
civilized
mode
of
life
article
eighth
specially
provides
for
supplying
them
with
seed
and
agricultural
implements
and
this
is
what
they
most
of
all
need
the
encouragement
held
forth
in
this
treaty
was
one
great
motive
in
leading
these
people
to
break
tribal
influences
so
deleterious
to
improvement
and
adopt
our
democratic
civilization
is
it
not
base
tyranny
to
disappoint
them
they
are
the
first
sioux
if
not
the
first
indians
in
the
united
states
to
adopt
the
spirit
and
life
of
our
american
civilization
they
have
of
their
own
accord
done
just
what
the
government
has
been
for
generations
trying
to
get
the
indians
to
do
and
now
will
the
government
refuse
this
helping
hand
to
our
shame
it
has
for
two
years
refused
and
why
because
the
indians
said
if
we
become
civilized
it
is
necessary
for
us
to
break
up
tribal
relations
and
settle
down
like
white
men
in
the
government
at
last
yielded
to
this
request
and
sent
out
oxen
wagons
ploughs
enough
to
stock
thirty
farms
in
williamson
having
been
appointed
a
special
agent
for
them
reports
their
progress
they
all
live
in
and
wear
citizens
dress
one
hundred
and
nineteen
can
read
their
own
language
fluently
they
all
go
to
church
regularly
they
have
broken
one
hundred
and
acres
of
new
prairie
twenty
new
houses
have
been
built
they
have
cut
and
hauled
two
hundred
cords
of
wood
hauling
some
of
it
forty
miles
to
market
they
have
done
considerable
freighting
with
their
teams
going
sometimes
a
hundred
miles
away
they
have
earned
hundred
dollars
catching
small
furs
one
indian
has
the
contract
for
carrying
the
mail
through
flandreau
for
which
he
receives
one
thousand
dollars
a
year
it
is
but
a
few
miles
from
flandreau
to
the
quarry
and
these
indians
make
many
little
sums
by
selling
pipes
rings
made
of
this
beautiful
red
stone
they
are
anxious
to
be
taught
how
to
make
baskets
mats
cloth
and
the
young
men
ask
to
be
taught
the
blacksmith
and
carpenter
trades
this
is
a
community
that
only
five
years
before
had
pushed
out
into
an
unbroken
wilderness
without
a
dollar
of
money
without
a
plough
to
open
farms
without
ploughs
they
had
to
dig
the
sod
with
their
hoes
and
at
the
same
time
make
their
living
by
hunting
they
suffered
severe
hardships
and
a
number
of
their
best
men
perished
in
believing
they
were
carrying
out
the
wishes
of
the
great
father
as
expressed
in
the
treaty
of
to
which
they
were
parties
they
were
disappointed
when
for
three
years
no
notice
was
taken
of
them
there
is
something
pathetic
in
the
gratitude
they
are
said
now
to
feel
for
the
niggardly
gift
of
a
few
oxen
wagons
and
ploughs
they
have
apparently
given
over
all
hope
of
ever
obtaining
any
of
the
money
due
them
on
account
of
their
lands
sold
in
minnesota
no
further
allusion
is
made
to
it
by
williamson
from
the
yankton
sioux
this
year
comes
a
remarkable
report
we
have
no
jail
no
law
except
the
treaty
and
the
agent
word
yet
we
have
no
quarrels
no
fighting
and
with
one
or
two
exceptions
not
a
single
case
of
drunkenness
during
the
year
this
i
consider
remarkable
when
we
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
the
reservation
is
surrounded
by
ranches
where
liquors
of
all
kinds
can
be
obtained
is
there
another
village
of
two
thousand
inhabitants
in
the
united
states
of
which
this
can
be
said
in
this
year
a
commission
was
sent
to
treat
with
some
of
the
wilder
bands
of
sioux
for
the
relinquishment
of
their
right
to
hunt
and
roam
over
a
large
part
of
their
unneeded
territory
in
kansas
and
nebraska
some
of
the
chiefs
consented
red
cloud
band
refused
at
first
but
on
being
told
that
the
right
would
soon
be
taken
from
them
after
a
delay
of
two
days
they
agreed
to
accept
merely
stipulating
that
their
share
of
the
thousand
dollars
promised
should
be
paid
in
horses
and
guns
they
insisted
however
on
this
proviso
that
we
do
not
surrender
any
right
of
occupation
of
the
country
situated
in
nebraska
north
of
the
divide
which
is
south
of
and
near
to
the
niobrara
river
and
west
of
the
one
hundredth
meridian
it
was
a
significant
fact
that
when
these
sioux
gave
up
this
hunting
privilege
they
requested
that
nearly
all
the
they
received
in
compensation
for
this
relinquishment
should
be
expended
in
cows
horses
harness
and
wagons
says
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
in
there
are
still
some
thousand
or
more
of
hostile
sioux
roaming
about
under
the
famous
chief
sitting
by
the
chase
when
they
can
and
by
depredations
when
they
must
occasionally
also
appearing
at
agencies
and
drawing
rations
among
the
other
indians
unsuspected
the
remainder
of
the
bands
are
steadily
working
their
way
on
toward
civilization
the
santees
are
a
christian
community
they
have
their
and
they
publish
a
monthly
paper
in
the
dakota
tongue
which
prints
twelve
hundred
copies
the
yanktons
have
learned
to
weave
and
have
made
cloth
enough
to
give
every
indian
woman
in
the
tribe
one
good
dress
the
flandreau
citizen
sioux
have
a
presbyterian
church
of
one
hundred
and
members
and
pay
half
the
salary
of
the
native
preacher
on
the
occasion
of
an
anniversary
meeting
of
the
dakota
missionaries
there
these
people
raised
one
hundred
dollars
to
pay
for
their
entertainment
these
three
bands
are
far
the
most
advanced
but
all
the
others
are
making
steady
progress
in
the
news
from
the
sioux
on
the
agencies
is
that
owing
to
the
failure
of
appropriations
the
indian
bureau
had
been
unable
to
send
the
regular
supplies
and
the
indians
being
in
almost
a
starving
condition
had
been
induced
by
the
apparent
purpose
of
the
government
to
abandon
them
to
starvation
to
go
north

the
hostile
camps
of
sitting
bull
this
was
in
the
spring
again
in
midsummer
the
same
thing
happened
and
many
of
the
indians
growing
still
more
anxious
and
suspicious
left
their
agencies
to
join
in
the
war
congress
would
probably
have
paid
little
attention
at
this
time
to
the
reading
of
this
extract
from
kent
commentaries
treaties
of
peace
when
made
by
the
competent
power
are
obligatory
on
the
whole
nation
if
the
treaty
requires
the
payment
of
money
to
carry
it
into
effect
and
the
money
can
not
be
raised
but
by
an
act
of
the
legislature
the
treaty
is
morally
obligatory
upon
the
legislature
to
pass
the
law
and
to
repeal
it
would
be
a
breach
of
the
public
faith
a
disturbed
and
unsettled
condition
of
things
prevailed
at
all
the
sioux
agencies
consequent
on
this
state
of
things
companies
of
troops
were
stationed
at
all
of
them
to
guard
against
outbreaks
owing
to
lack
of
funds
the
yanktons
were
obliged
to
give
up
their
weaving
and
at
the
standing
rock
agency
after
the
indians
had
planted
eight
hundred
and
dollars
worth
of
corn
potatoes
and
other
grasshoppers
came
and
devoured
them
many
of
these
indians
with
their
whole
families
stood
all
day
in
their
fields
fighting
these
enemies
and
in
several
places
succeeded
so
far
as
to
save
a
considerable
part
of
their
crops
the
santees
were
made
very
anxious
and
unhappy
by
fresh
rumors
of
their
probable
removal
public
sentiment
at
the
east
knowing
no
difference
between
different
tribes
of
sioux
regarded
it
as
maudlin
sentimentalism
to
claim
for
the
santees
any
more
rights
than
for
the
hostiles
that
had
murdered
general
custer
one
of
the
agents
in
dakota
writes
the
recent
troubles
in
the
indian
country
and
the
existing
uncertainty
as
to
the
future
intentions
of
the
government
toward
the
indians
occasion
considerable
uneasiness
among
them
reports
are
circulated
that
no
further
assistance
will
be
rendered
by
the
government
as
the
great
council
in
washington
refuses
to
furnish
money
unless
the
indians
are
turned
over
to
the
war
department
every
inducement
is
held
out
to
encourage
secession
from
the
agencies
and
strengthen
the
forces
of
the
hostile
camp
it
is
not
surprising
that
in
view
of
the
of
supplies
and
the
recent
order
of
the
war
department
to
arrest
parties
leaving
and
arriving
that
people
less
credulous
than
indians
would
feel
undecided
and
uneasy
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
whole
sioux
nation
is
related
and
that
there
is
hardly
a
man
woman
or
child
in
the
hostile
camp
who
has
not
blood
relations
at
one
or
the
other
of
the
agencies
contrast
the
condition
into
which
all
these
friendly
indians
are
suddenly
plunged
now
with
their
condition
only
two
years
previous
martial
law
now
in
force
on
all
their
reservations
themselves
in
danger
of
starvation
and
constantly
exposed
to
the
influence
of
emissaries
from
their
friends
and
relations
urging
them
to
join
in
fighting
this
treacherous
government
that
had
kept
faith
with
with
friend
nor
with
foe
that
made
no
discriminations
in
its
warfare
between
friends
and
foes
burning
villages
occupied
only
by
women
and
children
butchering
bands
of
indians
living
peacefully
under
protection
of
its
flag
as
at
sand
creek
in
wonder
that
one
of
the
military
commander
official
reports
says
the
hostile
body
was
largely
by
accessions
from
the
various
agencies
where
the
malcontents
were
doubtless
in
many
cases
driven
to
desperation
by
starvation
and
the
heartless
frauds
perpetrated
on
them
and
that
the
interior
department
is
obliged
to
confess
that
such
desertions
were
largely
due
to
the
uneasiness
which
the
indians
had
long
felt
on
account
of
the
infraction
of
treaty
stipulations
by
the
white
invasion
of
the
black
hills
seriously
aggravated
at
the
most
critical
period
by
irregular
and
insufficient
issues
of
rations
necessitated
by
inadequate
and
delayed
appropriations
it
was
at
this
time
that
sitting
bull
made
his
famous
reply
tell
them
at
washington
if
they
have
one
man
who
speaks
the
truth
to
send
him
to
me
and
i
will
listen
to
what
he
has
to
say
the
story
of
the
military
campaign
against
these
hostile
sioux
in
and
is
to
be
read
in
the
official
records
of
the
war
department
so
far
as
statistics
can
tell
it
another
history
which
can
never
be
read
is
written
in
the
hearts
of
widowed
women
in
the
sioux
nation
and
in
the
nation
of
the
united
states
before
midsummer
the
sioux
war
was
over
the
indomitable
sitting
bull
had
escaped
to
sanctuary
of
refuge
for
the
indian
as
well
as
for
the
slave
here
he
was
visited
in
the
autumn
by
a
commission
from
the
united
states
empowered
by
the
president
to
invite
him
with
his
people
to
return
and
be
assigned
to
agencies
and
treated
in
as
friendly
a
spirit
as
other
indians
had
been
who
had
surrendered
it
was
explained
to
him
that
every
one
of
the
indians
who
had
surrendered
had
been
treated
in
the
same
manner
as
those
of
your
nation
who
during
all
the
past
troubles
remained
peaceably
at
their
agencies
as
a
great
part
of
those
who
had
fled
from
these
same
agencies
to
join
sitting
bull
had
done
so
because
they
were
starving
and
the
government
knew
this
had
printed
the
record
of
the
fact
in
the
reports
of
two
of
its
departments
this
was
certainly
a
strange
phraseology
of
invitation
for
it
to
address
to
sitting
bull
his
replies
and
those
of
his
chiefs
were
full
of
scathing
sarcasm
secure
on
british
soil
they
had
for
once
safe
freedom
of
speech
as
well
as
of
action
and
they
gave
the
united
states
commissioners
very
conclusive
reasons
why
they
chose
to
remain
in
canada
where
they
could
trade
with
the
traders
and
make
a
living
and
where
their
women
had
time
to
raise
their
children
footnote
see
appendix
art
the
commissioners
returned
from
their
bootless
errand
and
the
interior
department
simply
entered
on
its
records
the
statement
that
sitting
bull
and
his
adherents
are
no
longer
considered
wards
of
the
government
it
also
enters
on
the
same
record
the
statement
that
in
the
months
of
september
and
october
the
various
sioux
agencies
were
visited
by
a
commission
appointed
under
the
act
of
congress
august
of
that
year
to
negotiate
with
the
sioux
for
an
agreement
to
surrender
that
portion
of
the
sioux
reservation
which
included
the
black
hills
and
certain
hunting
privileges
outside
that
reserve
guaranteed
by
the
treaty
of
to
grant
a
right
of
way
across
their
reserve
and
to
provide
for
the
removal
of
the
red
cloud
and
spotted
tail
bands
to
new
agencies
on
the
missouri
river
the
commission
were
also
authorized
to
take
steps
to
gain
the
consent
of
the
sioux
to
their
removal
to
the
indian
territory
the
commission
were
successful
in
all
the
negotiations
with
which
they
were
charged
and
the
indians
made
every
concession
that
was
desired
by
the
government
although
we
were
engaged
at
that
very
time
in
fighting
their
relatives
and
friends
the
only
comment
needed
on
this
last
paragraph
is
to
suggest
that
a
proper
list
of
errata
for
that
page
should
contain
for
read
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
the
agreement
thus
entered
into
provided
for
subsisting
the
sioux
on
a
stated
ration
until
they
should
become
for
furnishing
schools
and
all
necessary
aid
and
instruction
in
agriculture
and
the
mechanical
arts
and
for
the
allotment
of
lands
in
severalty
in
accordance
with
this
act
a
commission
was
sent
to
select
a
location
on
the
missouri
river
for
the
two
new
sioux
agencies
the
red
cloud
and
spotted
tail
for
the
former
the
site
chosen
is
the
junction
of
yellow
medicine
and
missouri
rivers
and
at
that
point
agency
buildings
have
just
been
erected
says
the
report
of
the
indian
bureau
for
for
the
latter
the
old
ponca
reserve
was
decided
on
where
the
agency
buildings
storehouses
one
hundred
and
fifty
indian
houses
and
five
hundred
acres
of
cultivated
fields
left
vacant
by
the
poncas
offer
special
advantages
for
present
quarters
the
commissioner
says
the
removal
of
fourteen
thousand
sioux
indians
at
this
season
of
the
year
a
distance
of
three
hundred
miles
from
their
old
agencies
in
nebraska
to
their
new
quarters
near
the
missouri
river
is
not
a
pleasant
matter
to
contemplate
neither
the
present
secretary
of
the
interior
nor
the
present
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
is
responsible
for
the
movement
but
they
have
carried
out
the
law
faithfully
though
reluctantly
the
removal
is
being
made
in
accordance
with
the
act
of
august
it
is
proper
to
say
here
that
i
can
not
but
look
on
the
necessity
thus
imposed
by
law
on
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
as
an
unfortunate
one
and
the
consequences
ought
to
be
remedied
as
speedily
as
possible
let
us
for
a
moment
consider
that
the
spotted
tail
agency
was
in
on
the
west
bank
of
the
missouri
river
where
the
whites
became
exceedingly
troublesome
and
the
river
afforded
abundant
facilities
for
the
introduction
of
intoxicating
liquors
in
the
red
cloud
and
spotted
tail
agencies
were
removed
to
what
a
subsequent
survey
proved
to
be
the
state
of
former
agency
one
hundred
and
miles
from
cheyenne
and
the
latter
one
hundred
and
eight
miles
from
sidney
the
nearest
points
on
the
union
pacific
railroad
here
the
usual
attending
the
removal
of
these
indians
was
again
exemplified
in
placing
the
agencies
on
absolutely
barren
land
where
there
was
no
possibility
of
cultivating
the
soil
no
hope
of
their
being
enabled
to
become
and
where
they
have
of
necessity
been
kept
in
the
hopeless
condition
of
paupers
in
the
hope
of
placing
these
indians
upon
arable
land
where
they
might
become
civilized
and
the
determination
was
hastily
taken
to
remove
them
back
to
the
missouri
river
this
step
was
taken
without
a
proper
examination
of
other
points
on
their
reservation
where
it
is
stated
that
a
sufficient
quantity
of
excellent
wheat
lands
can
be
found
on
either
bank
of
the
white
river
and
where
there
is
also
timber
sufficient
in
quantity
and
quality
for
all
practical
purposes
the
indian
chiefs
in
their
interview
with
the
president
in
september
last
begged
that
they
might
not
be
sent
to
the
missouri
river
as
and
other
demoralization
would
be
the
consequence
this
was
the
judgment
of
the
best
men
of
the
tribe
but
the
necessity
was
one
that
the
president
could
not
control
the
provisions
and
supplies
for
the
ensuing
winter
had
been
placed
according
to
law
on
the
missouri
and
owing
to
the
lateness
of
the
season
it
was
impossible
to
remove
them
to
the
old
agencies
accordingly
the
necessities
of
the
case
compelled
the
removal
of
these
indians
in
the
midst
of
the
snows
and
storms
of
early
winter
which
have
already
set
in
if
there
were
absolutely
no
other
record
written
of
the
management
of
indian
affairs
by
the
interior
department
than
this
one
page
of
the
history
of
these
two
bands
of
the
sioux
tribe
this
alone
would
be
enough
to
show
the
urgent
need
of
an
entirely
new
system
so
many
and
such
hasty
uninformed
capricious
and
cruel
decisions
of
arbitrary
power
could
hardly
be
found
in
a
seven
years
record
of
any
known
tyrant
and
there
is
no
tyrant
whose
throne
would
not
have
been
rocked
if
not
upset
by
the
revolutions
which
would
have
followed
on
such
oppressions
there
is
a
sequel
to
this
story
of
the
removal
of
the
red
cloud
and
spotted
tail
sequel
not
recorded
in
the
official
reports
of
the
department
but
familiar
to
many
men
in
the
western
country
accounts
of
humorous
some
for
some
time
floating
about
in
western
newspapers
the
red
cloud
and
spotted
tail
bands
of
sioux
consented
to
go
to
the
old
ponca
reserve
only
after
being
told
that
all
their
supplies
had
been
sent
to
a
certain
point
on
the
missouri
river
with
a
view
to
this
move
and
it
being
too
late
to
take
all
this
freight
northward
again
they
would
starve
if
they
stayed
where
they
were
being
assured
that
they
would
be
allowed
to
go
back
in
the
spring
and
having
a
written
pledge
from
general
crook
in
whose
word
they
had
implicit
faith
that
the
government
would
fulfil
this
promise
they
at
last
very
reluctantly
consented
to
go
to
the
ponca
reserve
for
the
winter
in
the
spring
no
orders
came
for
the
removal
march
passed
april
orders
the
chiefs
sent
word
to
their
friend
general
crook
who
replied
to
them
with
messages
sent
by
a
swift
runner
begging
them
not
to
break
away
but
to
wait
a
little
longer
finally
in
may
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
went
himself
to
hold
a
council
with
them
when
he
rose
to
speak
the
chief
spotted
tail
sprung
up
walked
toward
him
waving
in
his
hand
the
paper
containing
the
promise
of
the
government
to
return
them
to
white
clay
creek
and
exclaimed
all
the
men
who
come
from
washington
are
liars
and
the
ones
are
the
worst
of
all
i
do
want
to
hear
one
word
from
are
a
old
liar
you
have
but
one
thing
to
do
here
and
that
is
to
give
an
order
for
us
to
return
to
white
clay
creek
here
are
your
written
words
and
if
you
do
give
this
order
and
everything
here
is
not
on
wheels
inside
of
ten
days
i
order
my
young
men
to
tear
down
and
burn
everything
in
this
part
of
the
country
i
do
want
to
hear
anything
more
from
you
and
i
got
nothing
more
to
say
to
you
and
he
turned
his
back
on
the
commissioner
and
walked
away
such
language
as
this
would
not
have
been
borne
from
unarmed
and
helpless
indians
but
when
it
came
from
a
chief
with
four
thousand
armed
warriors
at
his
back
it
was
another
affair
altogether
the
order
was
written
in
less
than
ten
days
everything
was
on
wheels
and
the
whole
body
of
these
sioux
on
the
move
to
the
country
they
had
indicated
and
the
secretary
of
the
interior
says
naïvely
in
his
report
for
the
indians
were
found
to
be
quite
determined
to
move
westward
and
the
promise
of
the
government
in
that
respect
was
faithfully
kept
the
reports
from
all
the
bands
of
sioux
for
the
past
two
years
have
been
full
of
indications
of
their
rapid
and
encouraging
improvement
the
most
decided
advance
in
civilization
has
been
made
by
the
ogallalla
and
brulé
sioux
says
the
report
of
the
indian
bureau
for
their
progress
during
the
last
year
and
a
half
has
been
simply
marvellous
and
yet
this
one
band
of
ogallalla
sioux
has
been
moved
since
eight
times
is
it
not
a
wonder
that
they
have
any
heart
to
work
any
hope
of
anything
in
the
future
it
is
no
longer
a
question
says
this
same
report
whether
indians
will
work
they
are
steadily
asking
for
opportunities
to
do
so
and
the
indians
who
are
willing
and
anxious
to
engage
in
civilized
labor
are
largely
in
the
majority
there
is
an
almost
universal
call
for
lands
in
severalty
there
is
a
growing
desire
to
live
in
houses
the
demand
for
agricultural
implements
and
appliances
and
for
wagons
and
harness
for
farming
and
freighting
purposes
is
constantly
increasing
that
all
this
should
be
true
of
these
wild
warlike
sioux
after
so
many
years
of
hardships
and
forced
wanderings
and
removals
is
incontrovertible
proof
that
there
is
in
them
a
native
strength
of
character
power
of
endurance
and
indomitable
courage
which
will
make
of
them
ultimately
a
noble
and
superior
race
of
people
if
civilization
will
only
give
them
time
to
become
civilized
and
christians
will
leave
them
time
and
peace
to
learn
christianity

the
poncars
as
the
remnant
of
a
nation
once
respectable
in
point
of
numbers
they
formerly
resided
on
a
branch
of
the
red
river
of
lake
winnipeg
being
oppressed
by
sioux
they
removed
to
the
west
side
of
the
missouri
on
poncar
river
where
they
built
and
fortified
a
village
and
remained
some
years
but
being
pursued
by
their
ancient
enemies
the
sioux
and
reduced
by
continual
wars
they
have
joined
and
now
live
with
the
mahas
omahas
whose
language
they
speak
their
numbers
are
estimated
by
lewis
and
clarke
as
being
only
about
two
hundred
all
told
but
this
small
estimate
is
probably
to
be
explained
by
the
fact
that
at
this
time
the
tribe
was
away
on
its
annual
and
their
village
had
been
so
long
empty
and
quiet
that
a
buffalo
was
found
grazing
there
a
few
years
later
the
tribe
is
reckoned
at
four
hundred
in
a
census
of
the
indian
tribes
taken
by
general
porter
in
they
are
set
down
at
six
hundred
the
artist
catlin
who
visited
them
a
few
years
later
rated
them
a
little
less
he
gives
an
interesting
account
of
the
chief
of
the
tribe
named
smoke
and
his
young
and
pretty
wife
the
pure
fountain
whose
portraits
he
painted
he
says
the
chief
who
was
wrapped
in
a
is
a
noble
specimen
of
native
dignity
and
philosophy
i
conversed
much
with
him
and
from
his
dignified
manners
as
well
as
from
the
soundness
of
his
reasoning
i
became
fully
convinced
that
he
deserved
to
be
the
sachem
of
a
more
numerous
and
prosperous
tribe
he
related
to
me
with
great
coolness
and
frankness
the
poverty
and
distress
of
his
with
the
method
of
a
philosopher
predicted
the
certain
and
rapid
extinction
of
his
tribe
which
he
had
not
the
power
to
avert
poor
noble
chief
who
was
equal
to
and
worthy
of
a
greater
empire
he
sat
on
the
deck
of
the
steamer
overlooking
the
little
cluster
of
his
wigwams
mingled
among
the
trees
and
like
caius
marius
weeping
over
the
ruins
of
carthage
shed
tears
as
he
was
descanting
on
the
poverty
of
his
little
community
which
he
told
me
had
been
powerful
and
happy
that
the
buffaloes
which
the
great
spirit
had
given
them
for
food
and
which
formerly
spread
all
over
their
green
prairies
had
all
been
killed
or
driven
out
by
the
approach
of
white
men
who
wanted
their
skins
that
their
country
was
now
entirely
destitute
of
game
and
even
of
roots
for
food
as
it
was
one
continuous
prairie
and
that
his
young
men
penetrating
the
countries
of
their
enemies
for
buffaloes
which
they
were
obliged
to
do
were
cut
to
pieces
and
destroyed
in
great
numbers
that
his
people
had
foolishly
become
fond
of
and
had
given
away
everything
in
their
country
for
it
that
it
had
destroyed
many
of
his
warriors
and
would
soon
destroy
the
rest
that
his
tribe
was
too
small
and
his
warriors
too
few
to
go
to
war
with
the
tribes
around
them
that
they
were
met
and
killed
by
the
sioux
on
the
north
by
the
pawnees
on
the
west
by
the
osages
and
konzas
on
the
south
and
still
more
alarmed
from
the
constant
advance
of
the
pale
enemies
from
the
whiskey
and
which
already
had
destroyed
of
his
tribe
and
would
soon
impoverish
and
at
last
destroy
the
remainder
of
them
in
this
way
did
this
shrewd
philosopher
lament
over
the
unlucky
destiny
of
his
tribe
and
i
pitied
him
with
all
my
heart
the
day
before
catlin
arrived
at
this
village
this
old
chief
young
created
a
great
sensation
in
the
community
by
accomplishing
a
most
startling
amount
of
bigamy
in
a
single
day
being
the
chief
son
and
having
just
been
presented
by
his
father
with
a
handsome
wigwam
and
nine
horses
he
had
no
difficulty
whatever
in
ingratiating
himself
with
the
fathers
of
marriageable
daughters
and
had
with
ingenious
slyness
offered
himself
to
and
been
accepted
by
four
successive
promising
to
each
of
them
two
on
them
profound
secrecy
until
a
certain
hour
when
he
would
announce
to
the
whole
tribe
that
he
was
to
be
married
at
the
time
appointed
he
appeared
followed
by
some
of
his
young
friends
leading
eight
horses
addressing
the
prospective
who
stood
nearest
him
with
his
daughter
by
his
side
he
said
you
promised
me
your
daughter
here
are
the
two
horses
a
great
hubbub
immediately
arose
the
three
others
all
springing
forward
angry
and
perplexed
claiming
his
promises
made
to
them
the
triumphant
young
turk
exclaimed
you
have
all
now
acknowledged
your
engagements
to
me
and
must
fulfil
them
here
are
your
horses
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
the
horses
were
delivered
and
leading
two
brides
in
each
hand
walked
off
with
great
dignity
to
his
wigwam
this
was
an
affair
totally
unprecedented
in
the
annals
of
the
tribe
and
produced
an
impression
as
profound
as
it
could
have
done
in
a
civilized
community
though
of
a
different
to
the
young
prince
credit
rather
than
to
his
him
out
as
one
daring
and
original
enough
to
be
a
big
medicine
catlin
says
that
he
visited
the
bridal
wigwam
soon
afterward
and
saw
the
four
modest
little
wives
seated
around
the
fire
seeming
to
harmonize
very
well
of
the
prettiest
the
bending
willow
took
a
portrait
and
a
very
young
woman
she
is
too
wrapped
in
a
beautifully
ornamented
fur
robe
much
handsomer
and
more
graceful
than
the
circulars
worn
by
civilized
women
the
united
states
first
treaty
with
this
handful
of
gentle
and
peaceable
indians
was
made
in
it
was
simply
a
treaty
of
peace
and
friendship
in
another
was
made
in
which
the
poncas
admit
that
they
reside
within
the
territorial
limits
of
the
united
states
acknowledge
their
supremacy
and
claim
their
protection
they
also
admit
the
right
of
the
united
states
to
regulate
all
trade
and
intercourse
with
them
the
united
states
on
their
part
agree
to
receive
the
poncar
tribe
of
indians
into
their
friendship
and
under
their
protection
and
to
extend
to
them
from
time
to
time
such
benefits
and
acts
of
kindness
as
may
be
convenient
and
seem
just
and
proper
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
after
this
there
is
little
mention
in
the
official
records
of
the
government
of
the
poncas
for
some
thirty
years
other
tribes
in
the
upper
missouri
region
were
so
troublesome
and
aggressive
that
the
peaceable
poncas
were
left
to
shift
for
themselves
as
they
best
could
amidst
all
the
warring
and
warring
interests
by
which
they
were
surrounded
in
the
agent
of
the
upper
platte
mentions
incidentally
that
their
lands
were
being
fast
intruded
upon
by
squatters
and
in
another
agent
reports
having
met
on
the
banks
of
the
missouri
a
large
band
of
poncas
who
made
complaint
that
all
the
indians
on
the
river
were
receiving
presents
and
they
were
overlooked
that
the
men
from
the
steamboats
cut
their
trees
down
and
that
white
settlers
were
taking
away
all
their
land
in
the
commissioner
for
indian
affairs
writes
treaties
were
entered
into
in
march
and
april
last
with
the
poncas
and
yankton
sioux
who
reside
west
of
iowa
for
the
purpose
of
extinguishing
their
title
to
all
the
lands
occupied
and
claimed
by
them
except
small
portions
on
which
to
colonize
and
domesticate
them
this
proceeding
was
deemed
necessary
in
order
to
obtain
such
control
over
these
indians
as
to
prevent
their
interference
with
our
settlements
which
are
rapidly
extending
in
that
direction
these
treaties
were
duly
laid
before
the
senate
at
its
last
regular
session
but
were
not
it
is
understood
finally
acted
on
by
that
body
relying
on
the
ratification
of
their
treaty
and
the
adoption
of
timely
measures
to
carry
out
its
provisions
in
their
favor
the
poncas
proceeded
in
good
faith
to
comply
with
its
stipulations
by
abandoning
their
settlements
and
and
withdrawing
to
the
small
tract
reserved
for
their
future
home
being
without
a
crop
to
rely
upon
and
having
been
unsuccessful
in
their
usual
summer
hunt
they
were
reduced
to
a
state
of
desperation
and
destitution
as
nothing
had
been
done
for
them
under
the
treaty
they
concluded
it
was
void
and
threatened
to
fall
back
upon
their
former
settlements
some
of
the
most
important
of
which
had
in
the
mean
time
been
taken
possession
of
by
numerous
white
persons
the
poncas
never
heard
of
grotius
or
vattel
but
in
assuming
that
the
treaty
was
void
because
it
was
not
fulfilled
they
only
acted
on
the
natural
principles
of
the
law
of
nations
and
of
treaties
as
laid
down
by
all
authorities
thucydides
said
they
are
not
the
first
breakers
of
a
league
who
being
deserted
seek
for
aid
to
others
but
they
that
perform
not
by
their
deeds
what
they
have
promised
to
do
upon
their
oaths
in
consequence
of
this
delay
to
fulfil
the
treaty
provisions
the
government
was
forced
to
step
in
at
the
last
moment
and
incur
a
heavy
expense
in
furnishing
the
poncas
with
food
enough
to
keep
them
from
starving
and
in
under
this
pressure
the
senate
ratified
the
treaty
by
it
the
poncas
ceded
and
relinquished
to
the
united
states
all
the
lands
they
had
ever
owned
or
claimed
wherever
situate
except
a
small
tract
between
the
ponca
and
niobrara
rivers
in
consideration
of
this
cession
the
united
states
government
agreed
to
protect
the
poncas
in
the
possession
of
this
tract
of
land
and
their
persons
and
property
thereon
during
good
behavior
on
their
part
to
pay
them
annuities
annually
for
thirty
for
the
first
five
years
then
for
ten
years
then
for
fifteen
years
to
expend
for
their
subsistence
during
the
first
year
for
building
houses
etc
to
establish
schools
and
to
build
mills
mechanics
shops
etc
to
give
for
the
payment
of
the
existing
obligations
of
the
tribe
two
years
later
the
agent
newly
appointed
to
take
charge
of
the
poncas
reports
to
the
department
the
amount
of
improvements
made
on
the
reservation
one
saw
and
two
agency
and
a
half
inside
lining
or
plastering
by
and
by
feet
in
size
six
small
round
three
with
a
small
shed
for
a
stable
a
light
for
cattle
and
a
canvas
shed
for
storing
under
and
about
sixty
acres
of
ground
broken
comprised
all
the
improvements
evidently
a
very
small
part
of
the
had
been
spent
as
yet
he
did
not
find
an
indian
on
the
reservation
from
fear
of
the
sioux
who
in
had
stolen
from
them
more
than
half
the
horses
they
owned
they
had
moved
down
the
niobrara
river
some
twenty
miles
nearer
the
missouri
it
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
the
agent
induced
them
to
return
and
after
they
did
so
they
huddled
their
tents
close
about
the
agency
buildings
and
could
not
be
induced
to
go
half
a
mile
away
unless
accompanied
by
some
of
the
white
employés
as
the
agent
had
no
food
to
feed
them
with
and
no
money
to
buy
any
spite
of
the
appropriation
of
for
subsistence
and
he
induced
them
to
go
off
on
a
hunt
but
in
less
than
a
month
they
came
straggling
back
begging
for
provisions
for
their
women
and
children
whom
they
had
left
on
the
plains
having
been
unable
to
find
any
game
or
any
food
except
some
of
them
went
to
visit
the
omahas
others
the
pawnees
where
they
remained
until
the
little
corn
they
had
planted
produced
in
the
mean
time
those
who
were
here
subsisted
mainly
on
and
plums
and
the
and
traded
away
most
of
their
blankets
and
annuity
goods
for
provisions
in
the
reports
are
still
more
pitiful
they
started
on
their
summer
hunt
toward
the
last
of
may
immediately
after
the
first
hoeing
of
their
corn
at
first
they
were
successful
and
found
buffaloes
but
afterward
the
ground
being
occupied
by
the
yanktons
who
were
sent
south
of
the
niobrara
by
the
general
commanding
the
district
and
who
were
about
double
the
number
and
with
four
times
as
many
horses
they
soon
consumed
what
meat
they
had
cured
and
were
compelled
to
abandon
the
chase
they
commenced
to
return
in
the
latter
part
of
july
they
went
away
with
very
high
hopes
and
reasonably
so
of
a
large
crop
but
returned
to
see
it
all
withered
and
dried
up
in
the
mean
time
the
plains
had
been
burnt
over
so
that
they
could
not
discover
the
roots
they
are
in
the
habit
of
digging
even
the
which
grow
on
bushes
down
in
ravines
and
gullies
are
withered
and
dried
on
the
limbs
the
building
i
occupy
was
constantly
surrounded
by
a
hungry
crowd
begging
for
food
i
am
warned
by
military
authority
to
keep
the
poncas
within
the
limits
of
the
reservation
but
this
is
an
impossibility
there
is
nothing
within
its
limits
nor
can
anything
be
obtained
in
sufficient
quantity
or
brought
here
soon
enough
to
keep
them
from
starving
the
poncas
have
behaved
as
well
if
not
better
than
under
like
circumstances
the
same
number
of
whites
would
have
done
i
have
known
whole
families
to
live
for
days
together
on
nothing
but
and
this
when
there
were
cattle
and
sheep
in
their
sight
at
this
time
martial
law
was
in
force
on
many
of
the
indian
reservations
owing
to
the
presence
of
roving
bands
of
hostile
sioux
driven
from
minnesota
after
their
outbreak
there
the
poncas
through
all
these
troubles
remained
loyal
and
peaceable
and
were
unwavering
in
their
fidelity
to
their
treaty
says
the
indian
commissioner
in
december
of
this
year
what
the
governmental
reports
call
a
very
unfortunate
occurrence
took
place
in
nebraska
a
party
of
poncas
consisting
of
four
men
six
women
three
boys
and
two
girls
returning
from
a
visit
to
the
omahas
had
camped
for
the
night
about
twelve
miles
from
their
own
reservation
in
the
night
a
party
of
soldiers
from
a
military
post
on
the
niobrara
river
came
to
their
camp
and
began
to
insult
the
squaws
offering
money
with
one
hand
and
presenting
a
revolver
with
the
other
the
indians
alarmed
pulled
up
their
lodge
and
escaped
to
a
copse
of
willows
near
by
the
soldiers
fired
at
them
as
they
ran
away
and
then
proceeded
to
destroy
all
their
effects
they
cut
the
lodge
covers
to
pieces
burnt
the
saddles
and
blankets
cut
open
sacks
of
beans
corn
and
dried
pumpkin
and
strewed
their
contents
on
the
ground
and
went
away
taking
with
them
a
skin
blankets
guns
and
all
the
small
articles
the
indians
ponies
were
hid
in
the
willows
early
in
the
morning
they
returned
with
these
picked
up
all
the
corn
which
had
not
been
destroyed
and
such
other
articles
as
they
could
find
packed
their
ponies
as
best
they
might
and
set
off
barefooted
for
home
after
they
had
gone
a
few
miles
they
stopped
and
built
a
fire
to
parch
some
corn
to
eat
some
of
the
women
and
children
went
to
look
for
leaving
three
women
and
a
child
at
the
camp
here
the
soldiers
came
on
them
again
as
soon
as
the
indians
saw
them
coming
they
fled
the
soldiers
fired
on
them
wounding
one
woman
by
a
ball
through
her
thigh
another
with
a
child
on
her
back
by
two
balls
through
the
child
thighs
one
of
which
passed
through
the
mother
side
these
women
were
fired
on
as
they
were
crossing
the
river
on
the
ice
the
soldiers
then
took
possession
of
the
six
ponies
and
all
the
articles
at
the
camp
and
left
the
squaws
and
children
who
were
looking
for
beans
were
half
a
mile
below
a
little
dog
belonging
to
them
barked
and
revealed
their
in
the
willows
the
soldiers
immediately
turned
on
them
dismounted
and
making
up
to
them
deliberately
shot
them
dead
as
they
huddled
helplessly
women
and
a
little
girl
one
of
the
boys
a
youth
ran
for
the
river
pursued
by
the
soldiers
on
reaching
the
river
he
dived
into
the
water
through
a
hole
in
the
ice
as
often
as
he
lifted
his
head
they
fired
at
him
after
they
went
away
he
crawled
out
and
escaped
to
the
agency
one
of
the
murdered
women
the
mother
of
this
boy
had
three
balls
in
her
head
and
cheek
her
throat
cut
and
her
head
by
a
another
the
youngest
woman
had
her
cloth
skirt
taken
off
and
carried
away
and
all
her
other
clothes
torn
from
her
body
leaving
it
naked
the
men
who
did
this
deed
belonged
to
company
b
of
the
seventh
iowa
cavalry
the
outrage
was
promptly
reported
to
the
department
and
the
general
commanding
the
nebraska
district
detailed
an
officer
to
examine
into
it
there
was
some
correspondence
between
the
military
authorities
relative
to
it
but
with
no
result
and
in
the
report
of
the
next
year
the
indian
commissioner
says
attention
was
called
last
year
to
the
fact
that
the
murderers
of
several
of
this
loyal
and
friendly
tribe
had
not
been
discovered
and
punished
i
trust
that
as
there
seems
to
be
no
probability
that
this
will
be
done
a
special
appropriation
may
be
made
for
presents
to
the
relatives
of
the
deceased
in
a
supplementary
treaty
was
made
with
the
poncas
extending
their
reservation
down
the
niobrara
to
the
missouri
river
and
the
government
agreed
to
pay
them
for
the
purpose
of
indemnifying
them
for
the
loss
they
had
sustained
in
this
outrage
and
in
others
for
the
ratification
of
this
treaty
also
they
waited
two
years
and
in
the
superintendent
of
the
dakota
territory
says
schools
would
have
been
in
operation
at
the
ponca
agency
before
this
time
but
for
the
long
delay
in
ratifying
the
supplementary
treaty
of
and
now
that
this
measure
has
fortunately
been
accomplished
there
can
be
no
further
necessity
for
delay
and
it
is
confidently
believed
another
year
will
witness
the
foundation
and
rapid
progress
of
an
english
school
at
this
agency
this
superintendent
having
been
in
office
only
one
year
was
probably
not
familiar
with
the
provisions
of
the
treaty
of
with
the
poncas
in
which
by
article
three
the
united
states
government
had
promised
to
establish
and
maintain
for
ten
years
at
an
annual
expense
not
to
exceed
one
or
more
manual
labor
schools
for
the
education
and
training
of
the
ponca
youth
in
letters
agriculture
mechanics
and
housewifery
this
educational
annuity
has
but
one
more
year
to
run
whatever
may
have
been
done
with
it
up
to
this
time
it
really
is
now
being
spent
on
schools
and
it
seems
a
great
pity
that
it
should
soon
cease
the
governor
of
dakota
in
evidently
thinks
so
too
for
he
writes
to
the
department
in
the
autumn
of
a
school
has
been
in
successful
operation
at
this
agency
the
ponca
for
the
past
nine
months
with
an
average
attendance
of
about
fifty
scholars
and
with
every
evidence
of
advancement
in
the
primary
department
of
an
english
education
but
just
at
this
interesting
period
of
its
existence
we
are
notified
by
the
agent
that
with
this
fiscal
year
all
funds
for
school
as
well
as
for
agricultural
purposes
cease
agreeably
to
the
terms
and
conditions
of
their
original
treaty
this
will
be
a
serious
and
irreparable
calamity
if
not
remedied
by
the
most
generous
action
of
the
government
if
funds
for
this
purpose
can
not
be
otherwise
procured
the
poncas
are
willing
and
anxious
to
transfer
their
old
reservation
to
the
government
for
a
moderate
extension
of
these
important
and
indispensable
benefits
the
governor
also
says
that
in
the
past
year
the
poncas
have
paid
out
of
their
annuity
money
for
all
the
improvements
which
had
been
made
on
lands
occupied
by
certain
white
settlers
who
were
ejected
from
their
new
reservation
by
the
terms
of
the
last
treaty
in
the
report
for
we
read
that
the
ponca
school
has
been
discontinued
for
want
of
funds
the
department
earnestly
recommends
an
appropriation
of
to
put
it
in
operation
again
the
new
governor
of
dakota
seconds
the
recommendation
and
regrets
to
say
that
for
the
enlightenment
of
the
indians
embraced
in
the
dakota
superintendency
there
is
not
one
school
in
operation
in
an
appropriation
of
was
made
by
the
department
from
a
general
educational
fund
for
the
purpose
of
resuming
this
school
the
condition
of
the
poncas
now
is
on
the
whole
encouraging
they
are
not
only
willing
but
extremely
anxious
to
learn
the
arts
by
which
they
may
become
and
conform
to
the
usages
of
white
men
with
the
comparatively
small
advantages
that
have
been
afforded
them
their
advancement
has
been
very
great
in
the
summer
of
they
built
for
themselves
sixteen
very
comfortable
in
the
summer
of
they
built
more
with
their
annuity
money
they
bought
cookstoves
cows
and
useful
implements
of
labor
they
worked
most
assiduously
in
putting
in
their
crops
but
lost
them
all
by
drought
and
are
in
real
danger
of
starvation
if
the
government
does
not
assist
them
all
this
while
they
see
herds
of
cattle
driven
across
their
reservation
to
feed
the
lately
hostile
coffee
sugar
tobacco
by
the
distributed
to
their
own
always
peaceable
always
loyal
tribe
is
digging
wild
roots
to
eat
and
in
actual
danger
of
starvation
nevertheless
they
are
not
discouraged
knowing
that
but
for
the
drought
they
would
have
had
ample
food
from
their
farms
and
they
make
no
attempts
to
retaliate
on
the
sioux
for
raiding
off
their
horses
and
stock
because
they
hope
that
the
government
will
keep
its
faith
with
them
and
that
suitable
remuneration
for
these
losses
will
be
made
them
according
to
the
treaty
stipulations
for
the
next
two
years
they
worked
industriously
and
well
three
schools
were
established
a
chapel
was
built
by
the
episcopal
mission
the
village
began
to
assume
the
appearance
of
permanence
and
thrift
but
misfortune
had
not
yet
parted
company
with
the
poncas
in
the
summer
of
the
missouri
river
suddenly
overflowed
washed
away
its
banks
hundreds
of
yards
back
and
entirely
ruined
the
ponca
village
by
working
night
and
day
for
two
weeks
the
indians
saved
most
of
the
buildings
carrying
them
half
a
mile
inland
to
be
sure
of
safety
the
site
of
their
village
became
the
bed
of
the
main
channel
of
the
river
their
cornfields
were
ruined
and
the
lands
for
miles
in
every
direction
washed
and
torn
up
by
the
floods
for
nearly
two
weeks
the
agent
writes
the
work
of
salvage
from
the
destruction
occupied
our
whole
available
force
night
and
day
we
succeeded
in
carrying
from
the
river
bank
to
near
half
a
mile
inland
the
whole
of
the
agency
buildings
mechanics
houses
stabling
and
than
twenty
every
panel
of
fencing
the
poncas
worked
well
and
long
often
through
the
night
and
the
fact
that
the
disaster
did
not
cost
us
ten
dollars
of
actual
loss
is
to
be
attributed
to
their
labor
continuous
and
sometimes
over
the
waters
terrible
and
turbid
on
the
edge
of
the
current
but
a
few
inches
below
them
and
into
which
a
fall
would
have
been
certain
death
even
for
an
indian
in
one
year
after
this
disaster
they
had
recovered
themselves
marvellously
built
twenty
new
houses
owned
over
a
hundred
head
of
cattle
and
fifty
wagons
and
put
three
hundred
acres
of
land
under
cultivation
about
three
acres
to
each
male
in
the
tribe
but
this
year
was
not
to
close
without
a
disaster
first
came
a
drought
then
three
visitations
of
locusts
one
after
the
other
which
so
completely
stripped
the
fields
that
nothing
was
left
but
a
few
prematurely
dry
stalks
and
straw
one
hundred
young
trees
which
had
been
set
soft
maple
and
and
died
in
the
locusts
came
again
destroyed
the
corn
and
oats
but
left
the
wheat
much
of
this
crop
however
was
lost
as
there
was
only
one
on
the
agency
and
it
could
not
do
all
of
the
work
many
of
the
indians
saved
a
part
of
their
crop
by
cutting
it
with
large
but
this
was
slow
and
much
of
the
wheat
dried
up
and
perished
before
it
could
be
harvested
by
this
tedious
process
this
year
was
also
marked
by
a
flagrant
instance
of
the
helplessness
of
indians
in
the
courts
two
poncas
were
waylaid
by
a
party
of
santees
one
of
the
poncas
murdered
and
the
other
seriously
wounded
this
occurred
at
the
yankton
agency
where
both
parties
were
visiting
when
the
case
was
brought
up
before
the
courts
a
motion
was
made
to
quash
the
indictment
for
want
of
jurisdiction
and
the
judge
was
obliged
to
sustain
the
motion
there
being
under
the
present
laws
no
jurisdiction
whatever
over
crimes
committed
by
one
indian
on
the
person
or
property
of
another
indian
in
the
indian
country
in
the
project
of
consolidating
all
the
indians
in
the
united
states
upon
a
few
reservations
began
to
be
discussed
and
urged
if
this
plan
were
carried
out
it
would
be
the
destiny
of
the
poncas
to
go
to
the
indian
territory
it
was
very
gratuitously
assumed
that
as
they
had
been
anxious
to
be
allowed
to
remove
to
nebraska
and
join
the
omahas
they
would
be
equally
ready
to
remove
to
indian
process
of
reasoning
whose
absurdity
would
be
very
plainly
seen
if
it
were
attempted
to
apply
it
in
the
case
of
white
men
after
a
series
of
negotiations
protestations
delays
and
bewilderments
the
tribe
at
last
gave
what
the
united
states
government
chose
to
call
a
consent
to
the
removal
the
story
of
the
influences
deceits
coercions
brought
to
bear
on
these
unfortunate
creatures
before
this
was
brought
about
is
one
of
the
most
harrowing
among
the
harrowing
records
of
our
dealings
with
the
indians
a
party
of
chiefs
were
induced
in
the
first
place
to
go
in
company
with
a
united
states
by
the
indian
territory
to
see
whether
the
country
would
suit
them
it
was
distinctly
promised
to
them
that
if
it
did
not
suit
them
they
should
then
be
permitted
to
go
to
washington
and
consult
with
the
president
as
to
some
further
plan
for
their
establishment
the
story
of
this
journey
and
of
its
results
is
best
told
in
the
words
of
one
of
the
ponca
chiefs
standing
bear
no
official
document
no
other
man
not
if
a
second
homer
should
arise
to
sing
tell
the
story
so
well
as
he
tells
it
we
lived
on
our
land
as
long
as
we
can
remember
no
one
knows
how
long
ago
we
came
there
the
land
was
owned
by
our
tribe
as
far
back
as
memory
of
men
goes
we
were
living
quietly
on
our
farms
all
of
a
sudden
one
white
man
came
we
had
no
idea
what
for
this
was
the
inspector
he
came
to
our
tribe
with
rev
hinman
these
two
with
the
agent
james
lawrence
they
made
our
trouble
they
said
the
president
told
us
to
pack
we
must
move
to
the
indian
territory
the
inspector
said
to
us
president
says
you
must
sell
this
land
he
will
buy
it
and
pay
you
the
money
and
give
you
new
land
in
the
indian
territory
we
said
to
him
do
not
know
your
authority
you
have
no
right
to
move
us
till
we
have
had
council
with
the
president
we
said
to
him
two
persons
wish
to
make
a
bargain
they
can
talk
together
and
find
out
what
each
wants
and
then
make
their
agreement
we
said
to
him
do
not
wish
to
go
when
a
man
owns
anything
he
does
not
let
it
go
till
he
has
received
payment
for
it
we
said
to
him
will
see
the
president
first
he
said
to
us
will
take
you
to
see
the
new
land
if
you
like
it
then
you
can
see
the
president
and
tell
him
so
if
not
then
you
can
see
him
and
tell
him
so
and
he
took
all
ten
of
our
chiefs
down
i
went
and
bright
eyes
uncle
went
he
took
us
to
look
at
three
different
pieces
of
land
he
said
we
must
take
one
of
the
three
pieces
so
the
president
said
after
he
took
us
down
there
he
said
pay
for
the
land
you
left
we
said
to
him
have
forgotten
what
you
said
before
we
started
you
said
we
should
have
pay
for
our
land
now
you
say
not
you
told
us
then
you
were
speaking
truth
all
these
three
men
took
us
down
there
the
man
got
very
angry
he
tried
to
compel
us
to
take
one
of
the
three
pieces
of
land
he
told
us
to
be
brave
he
said
to
us
you
do
not
accept
these
i
will
leave
you
here
alone
you
are
one
thousand
miles
from
home
you
have
no
money
you
have
no
interpreter
and
you
can
not
speak
the
language
and
he
went
out
and
slammed
the
door
the
man
talked
to
us
from
long
before
sundown
till
it
was
nine
at
night
we
said
to
him
do
not
like
this
land
we
could
not
support
ourselves
the
water
is
bad
how
send
us
to
washington
to
tell
the
president
as
you
promised
he
said
to
us
president
did
not
tell
me
to
take
you
to
washington
neither
did
he
tell
me
to
take
you
home
we
said
to
him
have
the
indian
money
you
took
to
bring
us
down
here
that
money
belongs
to
us
we
would
like
to
have
some
of
it
people
do
not
give
away
food
for
nothing
we
must
have
money
to
buy
food
on
the
road
he
said
to
us
will
not
give
you
a
cent
we
said
to
him
are
in
a
strange
country
we
can
not
find
our
way
home
give
us
a
pass
that
people
may
show
us
our
way
he
said
will
not
give
you
any
we
said
to
him
interpreter
is
ours
we
pay
him
let
him
go
with
us
he
said
shall
not
have
the
interpreter
he
is
mine
and
not
yours
we
said
to
him
us
at
least
to
the
railroad
show
us
the
way
to
that
and
he
would
not
he
left
us
right
there
it
was
winter
we
started
for
home
on
foot
at
night
we
slept
in
we
barely
lived
till
morning
it
was
so
cold
we
had
nothing
but
our
blankets
we
took
the
ears
of
corn
that
had
dried
in
the
fields
we
ate
it
raw
the
soles
of
our
moccasins
wore
out
we
were
barefoot
in
the
snow
we
were
nearly
dead
when
we
reached
the
otoe
reserve
it
had
been
fifty
days
we
stayed
there
ten
days
to
strengthen
up
and
the
otoes
gave
each
of
us
a
pony
the
agent
of
the
otoes
told
us
he
had
received
a
telegram
from
the
inspector
saying
that
the
indian
chiefs
had
run
away
not
to
give
us
food
or
shelter
or
help
in
any
way
the
agent
said
would
like
to
understand
tell
me
all
that
has
happened
tell
me
the
truth
this
otoe
agent
afterward
said
that
when
the
chiefs
entered
his
room
they
left
the
prints
of
their
feet
in
blood
on
the
floor
as
they
came
in
then
we
told
our
story
to
the
agent
and
to
the
otoe
we
had
been
left
down
there
to
find
our
way
the
agent
said
can
hardly
believe
it
possible
that
any
one
could
have
treated
you
so
that
inspector
was
a
poor
man
to
have
done
this
if
i
had
taken
chiefs
in
this
way
i
would
have
brought
them
home
i
could
not
have
left
them
there
in
seven
days
we
reached
the
omaha
reservation
then
we
sent
a
telegram
to
the
president
asked
him
if
he
had
authorized
this
thing
we
waited
three
days
for
the
answer
no
answer
came
in
four
days
we
reached
our
own
home
we
found
the
inspector
there
while
we
were
gone
he
had
come
to
our
people
and
told
them
to
move
our
people
said
are
our
chiefs
what
have
you
done
with
them
why
have
you
not
brought
them
back
we
will
not
move
till
our
chiefs
come
back
then
the
inspector
told
them
you
must
be
ready
to
move
if
you
are
not
ready
you
will
be
shot
then
the
soldiers
came
to
the
doors
with
their
bayonets
and
ten
families
were
frightened
the
soldiers
brought
wagons
they
put
their
things
in
and
were
carried
away
the
rest
of
the
tribe
would
not
move
when
we
got
there
we
asked
the
inspector
why
he
had
done
this
thing
and
he
got
very
angry
then
we
said
to
him
did
not
think
we
would
see
your
face
again
after
what
has
passed
we
thought
never
to
see
your
face
any
more
but
here
you
are
we
said
to
him
land
is
ours
it
belongs
to
us
you
have
no
right
to
take
it
from
us
the
land
is
crowded
with
people
and
only
this
is
left
to
us
we
said
to
him
us
alone
go
away
from
us
if
you
want
money
take
all
the
money
which
the
president
is
to
pay
us
for
twelve
years
to
come
you
may
have
it
all
if
you
will
go
and
leave
us
our
lands
then
when
he
found
that
we
would
not
go
he
wrote
for
more
soldiers
to
come
then
the
soldiers
came
and
we
locked
our
doors
and
the
women
and
children
hid
in
the
woods
then
the
soldiers
drove
all
the
people
the
other
side
of
the
river
all
but
my
brother
big
snake
and
i
we
did
not
go
and
the
soldiers
took
us
and
carried
us
away
to
a
fort
and
put
us
in
jail
there
were
eight
officers
who
held
council
with
us
after
we
got
there
the
commanding
officer
said
have
received
four
messages
telling
me
to
send
my
soldiers
after
you
now
what
have
you
done
then
we
told
him
the
whole
story
then
the
officer
said
have
done
no
wrong
the
land
is
yours
they
had
no
right
to
take
it
from
you
your
title
is
good
i
am
here
to
protect
the
weak
and
i
have
no
right
to
take
you
but
i
am
a
soldier
and
i
have
to
obey
orders
he
said
will
telegraph
to
the
president
and
ask
him
what
i
shall
do
we
do
not
think
these
three
men
had
any
authority
to
treat
you
as
they
have
done
when
we
own
a
piece
of
land
it
belongs
to
us
till
we
sell
it
and
pocket
the
money
then
he
brought
a
telegram
and
said
he
had
received
answer
from
the
president
the
president
said
he
knew
nothing
about
it
they
kept
us
in
jail
ten
days
then
they
carried
us
back
to
our
home
the
soldiers
collected
all
the
women
and
children
together
then
they
called
all
the
chiefs
together
in
council
and
then
they
took
wagons
and
went
round
and
broke
open
the
houses
when
we
came
back
from
the
council
we
found
the
women
and
children
surrounded
by
a
guard
of
soldiers
they
took
our
reapers
mowers
spades
ploughs
bedsteads
stoves
cupboards
everything
we
had
on
our
farms
and
put
them
in
one
large
building
then
they
put
into
the
wagons
such
things
as
they
could
carry
we
told
them
that
we
would
rather
die
than
leave
our
lands
but
we
could
not
help
ourselves
they
took
us
down
many
died
on
the
road
two
of
my
children
died
after
we
reached
the
new
land
all
my
horses
died
the
water
was
very
bad
all
our
cattle
died
not
one
was
left
i
stayed
till
one
hundred
and
of
my
people
had
died
then
i
ran
away
with
thirty
of
my
people
men
and
women
and
children
some
of
the
children
were
orphans
we
were
three
months
on
the
road
we
were
weak
and
sick
and
starved
when
we
reached
the
omaha
reserve
the
omahas
gave
us
a
piece
of
land
and
we
were
in
a
hurry
to
plough
it
and
put
in
wheat
while
we
were
working
the
soldiers
came
and
arrested
us
half
of
us
were
sick
we
would
rather
have
died
than
have
been
carried
back
but
we
could
not
help
ourselves
nevertheless
they
were
helped
the
news
of
their
arrest
and
the
intention
of
the
government
to
take
them
back
by
force
to
indian
territory
roused
excitement
in
omaha
an
omaha
editor
and
two
omaha
lawyers
determined
to
test
the
question
whether
the
government
had
a
legal
right
to
do
it
it
seemed
a
bold
thing
almost
a
hopeless
thing
to
undertake
it
has
passed
into
a
proverb
that
providence
is
on
the
side
of
the
heaviest
battalions
the
oppressed
and
enslaved
in
all
ages
have
felt
this
but
there
are
times
when
a
simple
writ
of
habeas
corpus
is
stronger
than
cannon
or
and
this
was
one
of
these
times
brought
into
the
district
court
of
the
united
states
for
the
district
of
nebraska
these
poncas
were
set
free
by
the
judge
of
that
court
will
not
the
name
of
judge
dundy
stand
side
by
side
with
that
of
abraham
lincoln
in
the
matter
of
emancipation
acts
the
government
attorney
the
hon
lambertson
made
an
argument
five
hours
long
said
to
have
been
both
ingenious
and
eloquent
to
prove
that
an
indian
was
not
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
being
a
person
or
citizen
under
the
law
judge
dundy
took
several
days
to
consider
the
case
and
gave
a
decision
which
strikes
straight
to
the
root
of
the
whole
decision
which
when
it
is
enforced
throughout
our
land
will
take
the
ground
out
from
under
the
feet
of
the
horde
of
unscrupulous
thieves
who
have
been
robbing
oppressing
and
maddening
the
indians
for
so
long
that
to
try
to
unmask
and
expose
their
processes
or
to
make
clean
their
methods
is
a
task
before
which
hundreds
of
good
whole
denominations
of
good
baffled
and
have
given
up
when
standing
bear
found
that
by
the
decision
of
judge
dundy
he
was
really
a
free
man
and
could
go
where
he
pleased
he
made
a
speech
which
should
never
be
forgotten
or
left
out
in
the
history
of
the
dealings
of
the
united
states
government
with
the
indians
after
a
touching
expression
of
gratitude
to
the
lawyers
who
had
pleaded
his
cause
he
said
hitherto
when
we
have
been
wronged
we
went
to
war
to
assert
our
rights
and
avenge
our
wrongs
we
took
the
tomahawk
we
had
no
law
to
punish
those
who
did
wrong
so
we
took
our
tomahawks
and
went
to
kill
if
they
had
guns
and
could
kill
us
first
it
was
the
fate
of
war
but
you
have
found
a
better
way
you
have
gone
into
the
court
for
us
and
i
find
that
our
wrongs
can
be
righted
there
now
i
have
no
more
use
for
the
tomahawk
i
want
to
lay
it
down
forever
uttering
these
words
with
eloquent
impressiveness
the
old
chief
stooping
down
placed
the
tomahawk
on
the
floor
at
his
feet
then
standing
erect
he
folded
his
arms
with
native
dignity
and
continued
i
lay
it
down
i
have
no
more
use
for
it
i
have
found
a
better
way
stooping
again
and
taking
up
the
weapon
he
placed
it
in
hands
and
said
i
present
it
to
you
as
a
token
of
my
gratitude
i
want
you
to
keep
it
in
remembrance
of
this
great
victory
which
you
have
gained
i
have
no
further
use
for
it
i
can
now
seek
the
ways
of
peace
the
first
use
that
standing
bear
made
of
his
freedom
was
to
endeavor
to
procure
the
freedom
of
his
tribe
and
establish
their
legal
right
to
their
old
home
in
dakota
accompanied
by
a
young
and
omaha
girl
and
her
brother
as
interpreters
and
by
tibbles
the
champion
and
friend
to
whom
he
owed
his
freedom
he
went
to
the
eastern
states
and
told
the
story
of
the
sufferings
and
wrongs
of
his
tribe
to
large
audiences
in
many
of
the
larger
cities
and
towns
money
was
generously
subscribed
everywhere
for
the
purpose
of
bringing
suits
to
test
the
question
of
the
poncas
legal
right
to
the
lands
which
the
united
states
government
had
by
treaty
ceded
to
them
in
specified
townships
thus
giving
to
them
the
same
sort
of
title
which
would
be
given
to
any
corporation
or
individual
very
soon
this
movement
of
standing
bear
and
his
companions
began
to
produce
on
the
community
a
strong
effect
shown
by
the
interest
in
their
public
meetings
and
by
expressions
of
strong
feeling
in
the
newspapers
this
attracted
the
attention
of
the
authorities
at
washington
letters
were
published
contradicting
many
of
standing
bear
assertions
statements
were
circulated
injurious
to
the
reputation
of
all
members
of
the
party
a
careful
observer
of
the
whole
course
of
the
department
of
the
interior
in
this
matter
could
not
fail
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
for
some
mysterious
unexplained
and
unexplainable
reason
the
department
did
not
fact
was
the
ponca
tribe
should
be
reinstated
on
its
lands
discussions
on
the
matter
grew
warm
the
inspector
who
had
been
concerned
in
their
removal
published
long
letters
reflecting
equally
on
the
veracity
of
standing
bear
and
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
standing
bear
replied
in
a
few
pithy
words
which
were
conclusive
in
their
proving
of
the
falsity
of
some
of
the
inspector
statements
the
secretary
also
did
not
think
it
beneath
his
dignity
to
reply
in
successive
newspaper
articles
to
the
reflections
upon
him
but
the
only
thing
that
was
made
clear
by
this
means
was
that
either
the
secretary
or
the
inspector
or
both
said
what
was
not
true
in
boston
the
interest
in
the
ponca
case
reached
such
a
height
that
a
committee
was
appointed
to
represent
the
case
in
washington
and
to
secure
legislation
upon
it
standing
bear
and
his
party
went
to
washington
and
in
spite
of
the
secret
hostility
of
the
interior
department
produced
a
powerful
impression
upon
congress
senator
dawes
of
massachusetts
and
senator
morgan
of
alabama
both
became
warm
advocates
of
their
cause
the
subject
once
started
case
after
case
came
up
for
investigation
and
the
congressional
committees
called
for
evidence
in
regard
to
several
of
the
more
striking
instances
of
injustice
to
indians
white
eagle
one
of
the
ponca
chiefs
who
had
lost
his
wife
and
four
children
and
who
was
himself
fast
sinking
under
disease
developed
by
the
malarial
indian
territory
came
to
washington
and
gave
eloquent
testimony
in
behalf
of
his
tribe
the
physicians
there
predicted
that
he
had
not
three
months
to
live
a
bill
was
introduced
into
congress
for
restoring
to
the
poncas
their
old
reservation
in
dakota
and
putting
their
houses
farms
in
the
same
good
condition
they
were
at
the
time
of
their
removal
the
story
of
that
removal
was
written
out
in
full
at
the
time
by
the
agent
who
superintended
it
that
he
should
forward
this
report
to
the
department
of
the
interior
was
natural
but
that
the
department
of
the
interior
should
have
been
willing
to
publish
it
to
the
country
to
have
it
on
the
official
record
of
its
management
of
indian
affairs
for
the
year
is
strange
it
will
make
a
fitting
conclusion
to
this
sketch
of
the
history
of
the
ponca
tribe
the
name
of
this
agent
was
howard
he
calls
the
report
journal
of
the
march
broke
camp
at
seven
and
marched
to
crayton
a
distance
of
thirteen
miles
roads
very
heavy
the
child
that
died
yesterday
was
here
buried
by
the
indians
they
preferring
to
bury
it
than
to
have
it
buried
by
the
white
people
broke
camp
at
seven
and
marched
to
neligh
a
distance
of
about
miles
the
day
was
cool
and
the
road
being
high
and
comparatively
good
the
travel
was
made
without
much
inconvenience
the
morning
opened
with
light
rain
but
at
eight
a
terrific
occurred
of
two
hours
duration
which
was
followed
by
steady
rain
throughout
the
day
in
consequence
of
which
we
remained
in
camp
during
the
day
a
child
died
and
several
women
and
children
were
reported
sick
and
medical
attendance
and
medicine
were
procured
for
them
buried
the
child
that
died
yesterday
in
the
cemetery
at
neligh
giving
it
a
christian
burial
broke
camp
at
ten
and
marched
about
eight
miles
crossing
the
river
about
two
miles
below
oakdale
village
were
unable
to
cross
at
neligh
the
road
being
about
two
feet
under
water
and
the
bridges
being
washed
away
the
road
was
fearfully
bad
and
much
time
and
labor
were
expended
in
making
the
road
and
bridges
at
all
passable
over
the
flats
where
the
crossing
was
effected
broke
camp
at
six
and
marched
twenty
miles
to
a
point
on
shell
creek
no
wood
at
this
place
and
none
to
be
had
except
what
little
had
been
picked
up
and
brought
in
by
the
trains
weather
cold
damp
and
dreary
the
indians
during
the
day
behaved
well
and
marched
splendidly
the
morning
opened
with
a
heavy
continuous
rain
which
prevailed
until
ten
broke
camp
at
eleven
and
marched
eight
miles
farther
down
shell
creek
when
it
again
commenced
raining
and
we
went
into
camp
the
evening
set
in
cold
and
rainy
and
no
wood
to
be
had
except
what
was
purchased
of
a
settler
the
morning
opened
cold
with
a
misty
rain
rain
ceased
at
seven
and
we
broke
camp
at
eight
and
marched
eight
miles
farther
down
shell
creek
when
a
heavy
coming
on
we
again
went
into
camp
several
of
the
indians
were
here
found
to
be
quite
sick
and
having
no
physician
and
none
being
attainable
they
gave
us
much
anxiety
and
no
little
trouble
the
daughter
of
standing
bear
one
of
the
chiefs
was
very
low
of
consumption
and
moving
her
with
any
degree
of
comfort
was
almost
impossible
and
the
same
trouble
existed
in
transporting
all
the
sick
last
evening
i
gave
orders
to
break
camp
at
five
this
morning
intending
if
practicable
to
reach
columbus
before
night
but
a
heavy
prevailed
at
that
time
broke
camp
at
seven
marched
seven
miles
when
we
came
to
a
slough
confluent
to
shell
creek
which
was
only
made
passable
after
two
hours
of
active
work
in
cutting
and
bringing
a
large
quantity
of
wheat
straw
from
a
distance
of
thirty
rods
with
which
we
covered
the
road
thickly
after
crossing
the
slough
we
marched
to
a
point
on
shell
creek
and
camped
having
made
about
fourteen
miles
during
the
day
broke
camp
at
seven
and
crossed
shell
creek
for
about
five
miles
the
road
led
over
a
divide
and
was
quite
good
but
in
coming
down
on
the
flats
which
extended
for
five
miles
between
the
bluffs
and
columbus
we
found
the
roads
for
the
entire
distance
almost
impassable
owing
to
the
many
deep
miry
sloughs
which
cross
the
road
and
the
generally
flooded
and
yielding
condition
of
the
soil
aside
from
the
sloughs
teams
had
to
be
frequently
doubled
in
order
to
get
the
wagons
through
the
difficulties
were
finally
overcome
and
the
train
marched
into
columbus
at
two
and
went
into
camp
at
soap
fork
having
made
a
march
of
about
ten
miles
the
march
of
five
miles
across
the
flats
occupying
about
seven
hours
major
walker
who
had
accompanied
us
from
the
niobrara
river
to
this
place
with
soldiers
under
orders
from
the
war
department
took
leave
of
us
and
returned
to
dakota
it
was
asserted
again
and
again
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
by
the
inspector
kemble
that
these
indians
were
not
removed
by
they
consented
to
go
in
another
part
of
this
same
report
this
agent
says
on
the
six
days
before
the
march
began
i
held
another
council
which
was
largely
attended
by
the
chiefs
headmen
and
soldiers
of
the
tribe
and
which
was
of
more
than
four
hours
duration
at
this
council
the
indians
maintained
that
the
government
had
no
right
to
move
them
from
the
reservation
and
demanded
as
an
inducement
or
equivalent
for
them
to
give
up
the
reservation
and
move
to
the
indian
the
payment
to
them
by
the
government
of
the
sum
of
and
second
that
before
starting
i
should
show
to
them
the
sum
of
which
they
had
been
told
had
been
appropriated
by
the
government
for
their
removal
to
all
of
which
i
replied
positively
in
the
negative
telling
them
that
i
would
not
accede
to
nor
consider
any
demands
that
they
might
make
but
that
i
would
take
under
my
consideration
reasonable
requests
that
they
might
submit
touching
their
removal
and
as
their
agent
do
what
i
could
for
them
in
promoting
their
welfare
that
i
demanded
that
they
should
at
all
times
listen
to
my
words
that
they
should
go
with
me
to
their
new
home
and
that
should
without
delay
give
me
their
final
answer
whether
they
would
go
peaceably
or
by
the
indians
refused
to
give
answer
at
this
time
the
council
closed
without
definite
results
and
the
indians
dispersed
with
a
sullen
look
and
determined
expression
this
evidently
was
not
the
consent
of
which
we
have
heard
we
come
to
it
presently
on
the
following
morning
however
may
they
sent
word
to
me
at
an
early
hour
that
they
had
considered
my
words
and
had
concluded
to
go
with
me
and
that
they
wanted
assistance
in
getting
the
old
and
infirm
together
with
their
property
over
the
niobrara
river
which
was
much
swollen
by
the
rains
and
at
a
low
temperature
what
a
night
must
these
helpless
creatures
have
passed
before
this
consent
was
given
seven
hundred
people
than
half
of
them
women
and
a
farming
people
not
armed
with
rifles
as
the
ogallalla
sioux
were
when
one
year
later
on
this
same
ground
the
chief
spotted
tail
told
commissioner
hayt
that
if
he
did
not
give
an
order
to
have
his
tribe
on
the
way
back
to
white
clay
creek
in
ten
days
his
young
men
would
go
on
the
at
once
and
the
commissioner
wrote
the
order
then
and
there
and
the
sioux
were
allowed
to
go
where
they
had
chosen
to
go
behold
the
difference
between
the
way
our
government
treats
the
powerful
and
treats
the
weak
what
could
these
ponca
farmers
do
they
must
without
delay
give
their
final
answer
whether
they
would
go
peaceably
or
what
did
mean
it
was
that
the
government
undertook
to
compel
the
cheyennes
to
go
to
indian
territory
and
in
that
cheyenne
massacre
the
cheyenne
men
women
children
and
babies
were
all
shot
down
together
what
could
these
ponca
farmers
do
what
would
any
father
brother
husband
have
done
under
the
circumstances
he
would
have
consented
to
go
the
agent
as
was
wise
took
them
at
their
word
quickly
and
that
very
day
at
five
had
the
entire
tribe
with
their
effects
across
the
river
off
the
reservation
and
in
camp
in
nebraska
the
agent
should
have
said
with
part
of
their
effects
for
it
was
only
a
part
and
a
very
small
part
that
this
helpless
party
were
allowed
to
take
with
them
all
their
agricultural
implements
and
most
of
their
furniture
were
left
behind
it
was
a
hard
day
work
the
getting
the
tribe
and
their
effects
across
the
river
the
agent
says
the
river
being
about
forty
rods
wide
and
the
current
so
swift
that
it
was
found
impossible
to
move
the
goods
across
in
any
other
way
than
by
packing
them
on
the
shoulders
of
the
men
the
quicksand
bottom
rendering
it
unsafe
to
trust
them
on
the
backs
of
animals
even
the
wagons
having
to
be
drawn
across
by
hand
let
us
dwell
for
a
moment
on
this
picture
seven
hundred
helpless
people
beginning
their
sad
journey
by
having
to
ford
this
icy
stream
with
quicksands
at
bottom
the
infirm
the
sick
the
old
the
infants
all
carried
by
packing
them
on
the
shoulders
of
the
men
what
a
scene
the
honorable
secretary
of
the
interior
said
in
one
of
the
letters
in
his
newspaper
controversy
with
the
inspector
in
regard
to
the
accounts
of
this
removal
that
the
stories
which
are
told
about
the
brutal
military
force
employed
in
compelling
their
the
poncas
removal
from
dakota
to
the
indian
territory
are
sensational
fabrications
at
least
the
official
record
which
is
very
full
and
goes
into
minute
details
does
not
in
the
least
bear
them
out
there
was
never
any
accusation
brought
against
the
military
force
of
brutality
in
this
removal
the
brutality
was
on
the
part
of
the
government
the
simple
presence
of
the
military
force
was
brutal
it
meant
but
one
thing
the
indians
understood
it
and
the
government
intended
that
they
should
understand
it
and
when
the
agent
of
the
government
said
to
these
indians
that
they
must
give
him
their
final
answer
whether
they
would
go
peaceably
or
by
force
he
intended
that
they
should
understand
it
has
anybody
any
doubt
what
were
the
orders
under
which
that
military
force
was
there
any
doubt
what
it
would
have
been
the
military
duty
of
major
walker
to
have
done
in
case
the
poncas
had
refused
to
consent
to
go
and
now
let
us
return
to
the
official
record
which
is
indeed
as
the
honorable
secretary
of
the
interior
says
very
full
and
goes
into
minute
details
and
let
us
see
in
how
much
it
will
bear
us
out
and
when
we
have
done
with
this
official
record
let
us
ask
ourselves
if
any
imagination
could
have
invented
so
a
story
as
it
tells

take
official
knowledge

recognition
of
the
noble
action
performed
by
the
ladies
of
milford
in
preparing
and
decorating
the
body
of
the
deceased
indian

for

in
a
style
becoming
the
highest
civilization
in
this
act
of
christian
kindness
they
did
more
to
ameliorate
the
grief
of
the
husband
and
father
than
they
could
have
done
by
adopting
the
usual
course
of
this
untutored

adopting
those
of
the

a
heavy

during

the
storm
most
disastrous
of
any
that
occurred
during

removal
of
the
poncas
under
my
charge
came
suddenly
upon
us
while
in
camp
on
the
evening
of
this
day
it
was
a
storm
such
as
i
never
before
experienced
and
of
which
i
am
unable
to
give
an
adequate
description
the
wind
blew
a
fearful
tornado
demolishing
every
tent
in
camp
and
rending
many
of
them
into
shreds
overturning
wagons
and
hurling
through
the
air
in
every
direction
like
straws
some
of
the
people
were
taken
up
by
the
wind
and
carried
as
much
as
three
hundred
yards
several
of
the
indians
were
quite
seriously
hurt
and
one
child
died
the
next
day
from
injuries
received

sensational

could
compete
with
this
the

head
chief
of
the

for
a
time
every
male
in

was
on
the
and
for
about
two
hours
the
most
intense
excitement
prevailed
heightened
by
continued
loud
crying
by
all
the
women
and
children
this
indian
who
is
reported
here
as
having
become
hostile
no
doubt
tried
to
kill
white
eagle
for
having
allowed
the
tribe
to
be
brought
into
all
this
trouble
it
is
the
general
feeling
among
the
less
intelligent
members
of
a
tribe
that
their
chiefs
are
bound
under
all
circumstances
to
see
that
they
come
to
no
harm
broke
camp
at
six
passing
through
baxter
springs
at
about
one
just
after
passing
baxter
springs
a
terrible
struck
us
the
wind
blew
a
heavy
gale
and
the
rain
fell
in
torrents
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
see
more
than
four
or
five
rods
distant
thoroughly
drenching
every
person
and
every
article
in
the
train
making
a
fitting
end
to
a
journey
commenced
by
wading
a
river
and
thereafter
encountering
innumerable
storms
during
the
last
few
days
of
the
journey
the
weather
was
exceedingly
hot
and
the
teams
terribly
annoyed
and
bitten
by
flies
which
attacked
them
in
great
numbers
many
of
the
teams
were
nearly
exhausted
and
had
the
distance
been
but
little
farther
they
must
have
given
out
the
people
were
all
nearly
worn
out
from
the
fatigue
of
the
march
and
were
heartily
glad
that
the
long
tedious
journey
was
at
an
end
that
they
might
take
that
rest
so
much
required
for
the
recuperation
of
their
physical
natures
now
let
us
see
what
provision
the
government
had
made
for
that
rest
and
recuperation
surely
much
required
and
fairly
earned
not
one
dollar
had
been
appropriated
for
establishing
them
in
their
new
home
not
one
building
had
been
put
up
this
people
was
set
down
in
a
wilderness
without
one
provision
of
any
kind
for
their
shelter
it
is
a
matter
of
astonishment
to
me
says
agent
howard
of
this
report
that
the
government
should
have
ordered
the
removal
of
the
ponca
indians
from
dakota
to
the
indian
territory
without
having
first
made
some
provision
for
their
settlement
and
comfort
before
their
removal
was
carried
into
effect
an
appropriation
should
have
been
made
by
congress
sufficient
to
have
located
them
in
their
new
home
by
building
a
comfortable
home
for
the
occupancy
of
every
family
of
the
tribe
as
the
case
now
is
no
appropriation
has
been
made
by
congress
except
of
a
sum
little
more
than
sufficient
to
remove
them
and
the
result
is
that
these
people
have
been
placed
on
an
uncultivated
reservation
to
live
in
their
tents
as
best
they
may
and
await
further
legislative
action
this
journal
of
howard
is
the
best
record
that
can
ever
be
written
of
the
sufferings
of
the
poncas
in
their
removal
from
their
homes
it
is
highly
colored
but
no
one
however
much
it
may
be
for
his
interest
to
do
so
can
call
it
a
sensational
fabrication
or
can
discredit
it
in
the
smallest
particular
for
it
is
an
official
record
authorized
and
endorsed
by
being
published
in
the
annual
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
the
remainder
of
the
ponca
tribe
is
still
in
indian
territory
awaiting
anxiously
the
result
of
the
efforts
to
restore
to
them
their
old
homes
and
to
establish
the
fact
of
their
indisputable
legal
right
to
them

the
winnebagoes
the
winnebagoes
belonged
to
the
dakota
family
but
so
far
as
can
be
known
were
naturally
a
people
and
had
no
sympathy
with
the
more
warlike
tribes
of
their
race
the
algonquins
gave
them
the
name
of
winnebagoes
or
people
of
the
and
as
the
algonquin
word
for
and
was
the
same
the
french
called
them
les
puants
or
stinkards
the
sioux
gave
them
a
more
melodious
and
pleasing
name
which
signified
the
large
strong
people
bancroft
in
his
account
of
the
north
american
tribes
says
one
little
community
of
the
dakota
sioux
family
had
penetrated
the
territories
of
the
algonquins
the
winnebagoes
dwelling
between
green
bay
and
the
lake
that
bears
their
name
preferred
to
be
environed
by
algonquins
than
to
stay
in
the
dangerous
vicinity
of
their
own
kindred
one
of
the
earliest
mentions
that
is
found
of
this
tribe
in
the
diplomatic
history
of
our
country
is
in
the
reports
given
of
a
council
held
in
july
at
portage
des
sioux
in
missouri
after
the
treaty
of
ghent
to
this
council
the
winnebagoes
refused
to
send
delegates
and
their
refusal
was
evidently
considered
a
matter
of
some
moment
the
commissioners
appointed
to
treat
with
the
indians
at
this
time
reported
that
they
found
the
indians
much
divided
among
themselves
in
regard
to
peace
with
the
united
states
some
of
them
spoke
without
disguise
of
their
opposition
to
military
establishments
on
the
mississippi
and
many
of
them
among
whom
were
the
winnebagoes
utterly
refused
to
send
deputies
to
the
council
this
disaffection
was
thought
by
the
commissioners
to
be
largely
due
to
the
influence
of
british
traders
who
plied
the
indians
with
gifts
and
assured
them
that
war
would
soon
break
out
again
between
the
united
states
and
great
britain
it
is
probable
however
that
the
winnebagoes
held
themselves
aloof
from
these
negotiations
more
from
a
general
distrust
of
white
men
than
from
any
partisan
or
selfish
leaning
to
the
side
of
great
britain
for
when
jedediah
morse
visited
them
only
seven
years
later
he
wrote
there
is
no
other
tribe
which
seems
to
possess
so
much
jealousy
of
the
whites
and
such
reluctance
to
have
intercourse
with
them
as
this
spite
of
this
reluctance
they
made
in
a
treaty
of
peace
and
friendship
with
the
united
states
agreeing
to
remain
distinct
and
separate
from
the
rest
of
their
nation
or
tribe
giving
them
no
assistance
whatever
until
peace
shall
be
concluded
between
the
united
states
and
their
tribe
or
nation
they
agreed
also
to
confirm
and
observe
all
the
lines
of
british
french
or
spanish
cessions
of
land
to
the
united
states
in
the
united
states
government
unable
to
endure
the
spectacle
of
indians
warring
among
themselves
and
massacring
each
other
appears
in
the
country
as
an
unselfish
pacificator
and
compels
the
sacs
foxes
chippewas
and
sioux
including
the
winnebagoes
to
make
a
treaty
of
peace
and
friendship
with
each
other
and
with
the
united
states
the
negotiations
for
this
treaty
occupied
one
month
which
does
not
seem
a
long
time
when
one
considers
that
the
boundaries
of
all
the
lands
to
be
occupied
by
these
respective
tribes
were
to
be
defined
and
that
in
those
days
and
regions
definitions
of
distance
were
stated
in
such
phrases
as
a
half
day
march
a
long
day
march
about
a
day
paddle
in
a
canoe
to
a
point
where
the
woods
come
out
into
the
meadows
to
a
point
on
buffalo
river
half
way
between
its
source
and
its
mouth
these
were
surely
precarious
terms
for
peace
to
rest
upon
especially
as
it
was
understood
by
all
parties
that
no
tribe
shall
hunt
within
the
actual
limits
of
any
other
without
their
consent
at
the
close
of
this
treaty
there
occurred
a
curious
incident
which
schoolcraft
calls
an
experiment
on
the
moral
sense
of
the
indians
with
regard
to
intoxicating
liquors
it
had
been
said
by
the
tribes
that
the
true
reason
for
the
commissioners
of
the
united
states
speaking
against
the
use
of
ardent
spirits
by
the
indians
and
refusing
to
give
it
to
them
was
the
fear
of
expense
and
not
a
sense
of
its
bad
effects
to
show
them
that
the
government
was
above
such
a
petty
motive
the
commissioners
had
a
long
row
of
tin
holding
several
gallons
each
placed
on
the
grass
and
then
after
some
suitable
remarks
each
kettle
was
spilled
out
in
their
presence
the
thing
was
by
the
indians
who
loved
the
whiskey
better
than
the
joke
at
this
time
the
lands
of
the
winnebagoes
lay
between
the
rock
and
the
wisconsin
rivers
along
the
shore
of
winnebago
lake
and
the
indians
claimed
that
the
whole
lake
belonged
to
them
it
was
here
that
president
morse
had
found
them
living
in
he
gives
the
following
graphic
picture
of
their
pleasant
home
they
have
five
villages
on
the
lake
and
fourteen
on
rock
river
the
country
has
abundance
of
springs
small
lakes
ponds
and
rivers
a
rich
soil
producing
corn
and
all
sorts
of
grain
the
lakes
abound
with
firm
fish
of
the
indians
themselves
he
says
they
are
industrious
frugal
and
temperate
they
cultivate
corn
potatoes
pumpkins
squashes
and
beans
and
are
remarkably
provident
they
numbered
five
hundred
and
eighty
souls
in
a
third
treaty
was
signed
by
the
winnebagoes
chippewas
and
menomonies
with
the
united
states
and
with
each
other
this
treaty
completed
the
system
of
boundaries
of
their
lands
which
had
been
only
partially
defined
by
the
two
previous
treaties
of
these
three
treaties
schoolcraft
says
these
three
conferences
embody
a
new
course
and
policy
for
keeping
the
tribes
in
peace
and
are
founded
on
the
most
enlarged
consideration
of
the
aboriginal
right
of
to
the
soil
they
have
been
held
exclusively
at
the
charge
and
expense
of
the
united
states
and
contain
no
cession
of
territory
they
were
the
last
treaties
of
their
kind
in
the
people
of
northern
illinois
were
beginning
to
covet
and
trespass
on
some
of
the
indian
lands
and
commissioners
were
sent
to
treat
with
the
indians
for
the
surrender
of
such
lands
the
indians
demurred
and
the
treaty
was
deferred
the
united
states
in
the
mean
time
agreeing
to
pay
to
the
four
tribes
in
full
compensation
for
all
the
injuries
and
damages
sustained
by
them
in
consequence
of
the
occupation
of
any
part
of
the
mining
country
in
a
benevolent
scheme
for
the
rescue
of
these
tribes
of
the
territory
was
proposed
by
stevens
a
missionary
at
mackinaw
he
suggested
the
formation
of
a
colony
of
them
in
the
lake
superior
region
he
his
words
are
as
true
in
as
they
were
fifty
years
ago
the
indian
is
in
every
view
entitled
to
sympathy
the
misfortune
of
the
race
is
that
seated
on
the
skirts
of
the
domain
of
a
popular
government
they
have
no
vote
to
give
they
are
politically
a
nonentity
the
whole
indian
race
is
not
worth
one
white
man
vote
if
the
indian
were
raised
to
the
right
of
giving
his
suffrage
a
plenty
of
politicians
on
the
frontiers
would
enter
into
plans
to
better
him
whereas
now
the
subject
drags
along
like
an
incubus
in
congress
it
did
indeed
appropriations
were
sadly
behindhand
the
promises
made
to
the
indians
could
not
be
fulfilled
simply
because
there
was
no
money
to
fulfil
them
with
in
a
washington
correspondent
writes
to
schoolcraft
there
is
a
screw
loose
in
the
public
machinery
somewhere
in
we
were
promised
for
the
indian
service
and
got
in
and
got
a
little
later
the
secretary
of
war
himself
writes
our
annual
appropriation
has
not
yet
passed
and
when
it
will
i
am
sure
i
can
not
tell
in
the
topic
of
congress
is
said
to
be
the
removal
of
the
indians
it
occupies
the
public
mind
throughout
the
union
and
petitions
and
remonstrances
are
pouring
in
without
number
meantime
the
indians
were
warring
among
themselves
and
also
retaliating
on
the
white
settlers
who
encroached
upon
their
lands
the
inevitable
conflict
had
begun
in
earnest
and
in
september
of
the
winnebagoes
were
compelled
to
make
their
first
great
cession
of
territory
to
the
united
states
in
exchange
for
it
they
accepted
a
tract
west
of
the
mississippi
and
before
the
of
june
most
of
those
who
were
living
on
the
ceded
lands
had
crossed
the
river
to
their
new
homes
their
title
to
this
new
country
was
not
so
good
as
they
probably
supposed
for
the
treaty
expressly
stated
that
it
was
granted
to
them
to
be
held
as
other
indian
lands
are
held
article
three
of
this
treaty
said
as
the
country
hereby
ceded
by
the
winnebagoes
is
more
extensive
and
valuable
than
that
given
by
the
united
states
in
exchange
the
united
states
would
pay
to
the
winnebagoes
annually
in
specie
for
years
the
government
also
promised
to
put
up
buildings
for
them
send
teachers
make
various
allowances
for
stock
implements
tobacco
and
to
furnish
them
with
a
doctor
the
winnebagoes
agreed
to
deliver
up
some
of
their
number
who
had
murdered
white
settlers
lands
were
granted
by
patent
to
four
winnebagoes
by
men
and
two
women
for
what
reason
does
not
appear
in
the
treaty
five
years
later
the
winnebagoes
ceded
to
the
united
states
all
their
lands
east
of
the
mississippi
and
also
relinquished
the
right
to
occupy
except
for
hunting
a
portion
of
that
which
they
owned
on
the
west
side
for
this
cession
and
relinquishment
they
were
to
receive
part
of
this
sum
to
be
expended
in
paying
their
debts
the
expense
of
their
removal
and
establishment
in
their
new
homes
and
the
rest
to
be
invested
by
the
united
states
government
for
their
benefit
in
the
winnebagoes
were
forced
to
make
another
treaty
by
which
they
finally
ceded
and
sold
to
the
united
states
all
right
title
interest
claim
and
privilege
to
all
lands
heretofore
occupied
by
them
and
accepted
as
their
home
to
be
held
as
other
indian
lands
are
held
a
tract
of
acres
north
of
peter
and
west
of
the
mississippi
for
this
third
removal
they
were
to
be
paid
for
the
lands
they
gave
up
and
for
relinquishing
the
hunting
privilege
on
lands
adjacent
to
their
own
part
of
this
was
to
be
expended
in
removing
them
and
the
balance
was
to
be
left
in
trust
with
the
government
at
five
per
cent
interest
this
reservation
proved
unsuited
to
them
the
tribe
were
restless
and
discontented
large
numbers
of
them
were
continually
roaming
back
to
their
old
homes
in
iowa
and
wisconsin
and
in
they
gladly
made
another
treaty
with
the
government
by
which
they
ceded
back
to
the
united
states
all
the
land
which
the
treaty
of
had
given
them
and
took
in
exchange
for
it
a
tract
eighteen
miles
square
on
the
blue
earth
river
the
improved
lands
on
which
they
had
been
living
their
mills
and
other
buildings
were
to
be
appraised
and
sold
to
the
highest
bidder
and
the
amount
expended
in
removing
them
subsisting
them
and
making
them
comfortable
in
their
new
home
this
reservation
the
treaty
said
should
be
their
permanent
home
and
as
this
phrase
had
never
before
been
used
in
any
of
their
treaties
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
the
winnebagoes
took
heart
at
hearing
it
they
are
said
to
have
settled
down
quietly
and
contentedly
and
have
gone
to
work
immediately
ploughing
planting
and
building
the
citizens
of
minnesota
did
not
take
kindly
to
their
new
neighbors
an
indignation
meeting
was
held
a
petition
to
the
president
signed
and
movements
made
the
object
of
all
which
was
to
oust
these
indians
from
their
homes
says
the
report
of
the
indian
commissioner
for
such
movements
and
such
a
public
sentiment
on
the
part
of
the
population
surrounding
them
certainly
did
not
tend
to
encourage
the
winnebagoes
to
industry
or
to
give
them
any
very
sanguine
hopes
of
being
long
permitted
to
remain
in
their
permanent
home
nevertheless
they
worked
on
doing
better
and
better
every
year
keeping
good
faith
with
the
whites
and
with
the
government
and
trusting
in
the
government
purpose
and
power
to
keep
faith
with
them
the
only
serious
faults
with
which
they
could
be
charged
were
drunkenness
and
gambling
and
both
of
these
they
had
learned
of
the
white
settlers
in
the
latter
they
had
proved
to
be
apt
scholars
often
beating
professional
gamblers
at
their
own
game
they
showed
the
bad
effects
of
their
repeated
removals
also
in
being
disposed
to
wander
back
to
their
old
homes
sometimes
several
hundred
of
them
would
be
roaming
about
in
wisconsin
but
the
tribe
as
a
whole
were
industrious
quiet
always
peaceable
and
loyal
and
steadily
improving
they
took
hold
in
earnest
of
the
hard
work
of
farming
some
of
them
who
could
not
get
either
horses
or
ploughs
actually
breaking
up
new
land
with
hoes
and
getting
fair
crops
out
of
it
very
soon
they
began
to
entreat
to
have
their
farms
settled
on
them
individually
and
guaranteed
to
them
for
their
own
and
the
government
taking
advantage
of
this
desire
on
their
part
made
a
treaty
with
them
in
by
which
part
of
their
lands
were
to
be
allotted
to
individuals
in
severalty
as
they
had
requested
and
the
rest
were
to
be
sold
the
proceeds
to
be
partly
expended
in
improvements
on
their
farms
and
partly
to
be
left
in
trust
with
the
government
this
measure
threw
open
hundreds
of
thousands
of
acres
of
land
to
white
settlers
and
drew
the
belt
of
greedy
civilization
much
tighter
around
the
indians
similar
treaties
to
this
had
been
already
made
with
some
of
the
sioux
tribes
and
with
others
it
was
evident
that
the
surplus
land
occupied
by
the
indians
was
required
for
the
use
of
the
increasing
white
population
and
that
it
was
necessary
to
reduce
the
reservations
there
is
in
this
treaty
of
one
extraordinary
provision
in
order
to
render
unnecessary
any
further
treaty
engagements
or
arrangements
with
the
united
states
it
is
hereby
agreed
and
stipulated
that
the
president
with
the
assent
of
congress
shall
have
full
power
to
modify
or
change
any
of
the
provisions
of
former
treaties
with
the
winnebagoes
in
such
manner
and
to
whatever
extent
he
may
judge
to
be
necessary
and
expedient
for
their
welfare
and
best
interest
it
is
impossible
to
avoid
having
a
doubt
whether
the
chiefs
and
headmen
of
the
winnebago
tribe
who
signed
this
treaty
ever
heard
that
proviso
it
is
incredible
that
they
could
have
been
so
simple
and
trustful
as
to
have
assented
to
it
prospects
now
brightened
for
the
winnebagoes
with
their
farms
given
to
them
for
their
own
and
a
sufficient
sum
of
money
realized
by
the
sale
of
surplus
lands
to
enable
them
to
thoroughly
improve
the
remainder
their
way
seemed
open
to
prosperity
and
comfort
they
entered
upon
farming
with
a
zeal
and
energy
which
gave
promise
of
a
prosperous
and
creditable
future
every
family
in
the
tribe
has
more
or
less
ground
under
cultivation
says
their
agent
he
reports
also
the
minutes
of
a
council
held
by
the
chiefs
which
tell
their
own
story
when
we
were
at
washington
last
winter
we
asked
our
great
father
to
take
out
of
the
so
that
we
could
commence
our
next
spring
work
we
do
not
want
all
of
the
only
sufficient
to
carry
on
our
improvements
this
money
we
ask
for
we
request
only
as
a
loan
and
when
our
treaty
is
ratified
we
want
it
replaced
we
want
to
buy
cattle
horses
ploughs
and
wagons
and
this
money
can
be
replaced
when
our
lands
are
sold
we
hope
you
will
get
this
money
we
want
good
farms
and
good
houses
many
have
already
put
on
white
man
clothes
and
more
of
us
will
when
our
treaty
is
ratified
father
we
do
not
want
to
make
you
tired
of
talk
but
hope
you
will
make
a
strong
paper
and
urgent
request
of
our
great
father
in
respect
to
our
wishes
in
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
writes
the
winnebagoes
continue
steadily
on
the
march
of
improvement
the
progress
of
the
winnebagoes
in
agricultural
growths
is
particularly
marked
with
success
there
have
been
raised
by
individuals
as
high
as
sixty
acres
of
wheat
on
a
single
farm
the
agent
efforts
have
been
directed
to
giving
to
each
indian
his
own
allotment
of
land
wigwams
are
becoming
as
scarce
as
houses
were
two
years
ago
all
indians
who
had
horses
ploughed
and
farmed
their
own
lands
the
indians
were
promised
that
new
and
comfortable
houses
should
be
built
for
them
the
treaty
not
yet
being
ratified
i
have
no
funds
in
my
hands
that
could
be
made
applicable
to
this
purpose
the
greater
part
of
the
indians
have
entreated
me
to
carry
out
the
meaning
of
the
commissioner
on
his
visit
here
and
the
reasons
for
my
not
doing
so
do
not
seem
comprehensible
to
them
the
school
is
in
a
flourishing
condition
in
the
commissioner
writes
that
the
allotment
of
lands
in
severalty
to
the
winnebagoes
has
been
substantially
accomplished
but
that
the
sales
of
the
remaining
lands
have
not
yet
been
made
owing
to
the
unsettled
condition
of
the
country
and
therefore
the
funds
on
which
the
indians
were
depending
for
the
improvements
of
their
farms
have
not
been
paid
to
them
they
complain
bitterly
that
the
provisions
of
the
treaty
of
have
not
been
fulfilled
it
has
been
two
years
and
a
half
since
this
treaty
was
concluded
says
the
agent
and
the
indians
have
been
told
from
one
season
to
another
that
something
would
be
done
under
it
for
their
benefit
and
as
often
disappointed
till
the
best
of
them
begin
to
doubt
whether
anything
will
be
done
the
indians
who
have
had
their
allotments
made
are
for
their
certificates
drunkenness
is
becoming
one
of
the
serious
vices
of
the
tribe
they
are
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
white
men
who
traffic
in
whiskey
and
who
are
moreover
anxious
to
reduce
the
indians
to
as
degraded
a
state
as
possible
there
are
some
circumstances
connected
with
the
location
of
this
tribe
which
make
it
more
difficult
to
protect
them
from
the
ravages
of
than
any
other
tribe
they
are
closely
surrounded
by
a
numerous
white
population
and
these
people
feel
very
indignant
because
the
indians
are
settled
in
their
midst
and
are
disposed
to
make
it
as
uncomfortable
for
them
to
remain
here
as
they
can
hoping
at
some
future
time
they
may
be
able
to
cause
their
removal
the
time
was
not
far
distant
in
we
find
the
winnebagoes
in
trouble
indeed
a
ferocious
massacre
of
white
settlers
by
the
sioux
had
so
exasperated
the
citizens
of
minnesota
that
they
demanded
the
removal
of
all
indians
from
the
state
the
people
were
so
excited
that
not
an
indian
could
step
outside
the
limits
of
the
reservation
without
the
risk
of
being
shot
at
sight
the
winnebagoes
had
utterly
refused
to
join
the
sioux
in
their
attack
on
the
whites
and
had
been
threatened
by
them
with
extermination
in
consequence
of
this
loyalty
thus
they
were
equally
in
danger
from
both
whites
and
indians
their
position
was
truly
pitiable
in
the
annual
report
of
the
interior
department
for
the
condition
of
things
is
thus
described
while
it
may
be
true
that
a
few
of
the
winnebagoes
were
engaged
in
the
atrocities
of
the
sioux
the
tribe
as
such
is
no
more
justly
responsible
for
their
acts
than
our
government
would
be
for
a
pirate
who
happened
to
have
been
born
on
our
territory
notwithstanding
this
the
exasperation
of
the
people
of
minnesota
appears
to
be
nearly
as
great
toward
the
winnebagoes
as
toward
the
sioux
they
demand
that
the
winnebagoes
as
well
as
the
sioux
shall
be
removed
from
the
limits
of
the
state
the
winnebagoes
are
unwilling
to
move
yet
the
minnesota
people
are
so
excited
that
not
a
winnebago
can
leave
his
reservation
without
risk
of
being
shot
and
as
they
have
never
received
their
promised
implements
of
agriculture
and
the
game
on
their
reservation
is
exhausted
and
their
arms
have
been
taken
from
them
they
are
starving
their
agent
writes
these
indians
have
been
remaining
here
in
a
continuous
state
of
suspense
waiting
for
the
government
to
cause
the
stipulations
of
the
treaty
of
to
be
carried
into
operation
such
has
been
their
condition
for
three
years
and
a
half
and
they
do
not
understand
why
it
is
so
the
fact
that
a
very
few
of
the
winnebagoes
were
present
and
witnessed
if
they
did
not
take
part
in
the
massacre
at
the
lower
sioux
agency
has
caused
the
winnebagoes
themselves
to
be
universally
suspected
of
disloyalty
the
hostile
feelings
of
the
white
people
are
so
intense
that
i
am
necessitated
to
use
extra
efforts
to
keep
the
indians
upon
their
own
lands
i
have
been
notified
by
the
whites
that
the
indians
will
be
massacred
if
they
go
out
of
their
own
country
and
it
is
but
a
few
days
since
an
indian
was
killed
while
crossing
the
mississippi
river
for
no
other
reason
than
that
he
was
an
indian
and
such
is
the
state
of
public
opinion
that
the
murderer
goes
unpunished
as
to
the
loyalty
of
the
tribe
the
agent
says
there
is
no
tribe
of
indians
more
so
there
is
no
doubt
of
their
loyalty
as
a
tribe
in
consequence
of
a
threat
made
by
the
sioux
immediately
upon
their
outbreak
that
they
the
sioux
would
exterminate
the
winnebagoes
unless
they
joined
them
in
a
raid
against
the
white
people
the
winnebagoes
have
lived
in
fear
of
an
attack
from
the
sioux
and
have
almost
daily
implored
me
for
protection
to
further
assure
them
i
requested
of
the
governor
of
the
state
that
two
companies
of
united
states
infantry
be
stationed
here
in
their
midst
which
has
allayed
their
fears
notwithstanding
the
nearness
of
the
belligerent
sioux
and
the
unfriendly
feelings
of
the
white
people
and
other
unfortunate
circumstances
i
am
confident
that
my
indians
will
remain
loyal
to
the
last
they
have
been
informed
that
notwithstanding
their
fidelity
to
the
government
and
the
people
the
people
of
this
state
are
memorializing
congress
to
remove
them
out
of
the
they
consider
very
unjust
under
the
circumstances
for
they
have
become
attached
to
this
location
and
would
not
leave
it
willingly
and
think
their
fidelity
ought
to
entitle
them
to
respect
and
kind
treatment
the
popular
demand
of
the
people
of
minnesota
triumphed
in
february
congress
passed
an
act
authorizing
the
peaceful
and
quiet
removal
of
the
winnebago
indians
from
the
state
of
minnesota
and
the
settling
of
them
on
a
new
reserve
it
was
determined
to
locate
them
on
the
missouri
river
somewhere
within
a
hundred
miles
of
fort
randall
where
it
is
not
doubted
they
will
be
secure
from
any
danger
of
intrusion
from
whites
all
their
guns
rifles
and
pistols
were
to
be
taken
from
them
securely
boxed
up
labelled
with
the
names
of
their
respective
owners
the
department
impressed
it
on
the
agent
in
charge
of
the
removal
that
it
was
absolutely
necessary
that
no
time
should
be
lost
in
the
emigrating
of
these
indians
the
hostile
sioux
were
to
be
removed
at
the
same
time
and
to
a
reservation
adjoining
the
reservation
of
the
winnebagoes
the
reports
of
the
indian
bureau
for
tell
the
story
of
this
removal
footnote
see
appendix
art
vi
the
commissioner
says
the
case
of
the
winnebagoes
is
one
of
peculiar
hardship
i
am
still
of
the
opinion
that
this
tribe
was
in
no
manner
implicated
in
or
responsible
for
the
cruel
and
wanton
outbreak
on
the
part
of
the
sioux
but
its
consequences
to
the
tribe
have
been
as
disastrous
as
unmerited
in
obedience
to
the
act
of
congress
and
the
popular
demand
of
the
people
of
minnesota
they
have
been
removed
to
a
new
location
upon
the
missouri
river
adjoining
that
selected
for
the
sioux
contrasting
the
happy
homes
and
the
abundant
supply
for
all
their
wants
which
they
have
left
behind
them
with
the
extreme
desolation
which
prevails
throughout
the
country
including
their
present
location
and
their
almost
defenceless
state
as
against
the
hostile
savages
in
their
vicinity
their
present
condition
is
truly
pitiable
and
it
is
not
surprising
that
they
have
become
to
some
extent
discouraged
and
are
dissatisfied
with
their
new
homes
it
can
not
be
disguised
that
their
removal
although
nominally
peaceable
and
with
their
consent
was
the
result
of
the
overwhelming
pressure
of
the
public
sentiment
of
the
community
in
which
they
resided
and
it
is
to
be
feared
that
it
will
be
many
years
before
their
confidence
in
the
good
faith
of
our
government
in
its
professed
desire
to
ameliorate
and
improve
their
condition
will
be
restored
their
misfortunes
and
good
conduct
deserve
our
sympathy
the
act
of
congress
above
mentioned
provides
for
the
peaceable
removal
of
the
indians
in
its
execution
some
of
the
members
of
the
tribe
were
found
unwilling
to
leave
their
homes
and
as
there
was
neither
the
disposition
nor
the
power
to
compel
them
to
accompany
their
brethren
they
remained
upon
their
old
reservation
the
most
of
them
are
represented
as
having
entirely
abandoned
the
indian
habits
and
customs
and
as
being
fully
qualified
by
good
conduct
and
otherwise
for
civilized
life
many
of
them
are
enlisted
in
the
military
service
and
all
are
desirous
of
retaining
possession
of
the
homes
allotted
to
them
under
the
provisions
of
their
treaty
the
trust
lands
belonging
to
the
tribe
have
been
placed
in
the
market
and
from
the
amount
already
sold
has
been
realized
an
appraisement
has
also
been
had
of
the
lands
of
the
diminished
reserve
and
the
same
will
soon
be
placed
in
the
market
in
the
report
of
the
superintendent
of
the
territory
for
the
same
year
is
the
following
summing
up
of
their
case
the
case
of
these
winnebago
indians
is
one
of
peculiar
hardship
hurried
from
their
comfortable
homes
in
minnesota
in
almost
without
previous
notice
huddled
together
on
steamboats
with
poor
accommodations
and
transported
to
the
crow
creek
agency
in
dakota
territory
at
an
expense
to
themselves
of
more
than
they
were
left
after
a
very
imperfect
and
hasty
preparation
of
their
new
agency
for
their
reception
upon
a
sandy
beach
on
the
west
bank
of
the
missouri
river
in
a
country
remarkable
only
for
the
rigors
of
its
winter
climate
and
the
sterility
of
its
soil
to
subsist
themselves
where
the
most
industrious
and
frugal
white
man
would
fail
five
years
out
of
six
to
raise
enough
grain
upon
which
to
subsist
a
family
the
stern
alternative
was
presented
to
this
unfortunate
people
thus
deprived
of
comfortable
homes
on
account
of
no
crime
or
misdemeanor
of
their
own
of
abandoning
this
agency
or
encountering
death
from
cold
or
starvation
they
wisely
chose
the
former
and
after
encountering
hardships
and
sufferings
too
terrible
to
relate
and
the
loss
of
several
hundred
of
their
tribe
by
starvation
and
freezing
they
arrived
at
their
present
place
of
residence
the
omaha
agency
in
a
condition
which
excited
the
active
sympathy
of
all
who
became
acquainted
with
the
story
of
their
wrongs
there
they
have
remained
trusting
that
the
government
would
redeem
its
solemn
promise
to
place
them
in
a
position
west
of
the
missouri
which
should
be
as
comfortable
as
the
one
which
they
occupied
in
minnesota
this
tribe
is
characterized
by
frugality
thrift
and
industry
to
an
extent
unequalled
by
any
other
tribe
of
indians
in
the
loyal
to
the
government
and
peaceable
toward
their
neighbors
they
are
entitled
to
the
fostering
care
of
the
general
government
the
improvement
of
the
homes
which
they
have
voluntarily
selected
for
their
future
residence
will
place
them
in
a
short
time
beyond
the
reach
of
want
and
take
from
the
government
the
burden
of
supplying
their
wants
at
an
actual
expense
of
it
was
in
may
that
the
winnebagoes
gathered
at
fort
snelling
ready
for
their
journey
the
chiefs
are
said
to
have
acquiesced
in
the
move
as
a
matter
of
necessity
for
the
protection
of
their
people
but
some
of
them
actually
shed
tears
on
taking
leave
colonel
mix
who
was
in
charge
of
this
removal
wrote
to
washington
urgently
entreating
that
tents
at
least
might
be
provided
for
them
on
their
arrival
at
their
new
homes
in
the
wilderness
he
also
suggests
that
it
is
a
question
whether
they
ought
to
be
settled
so
near
the
hostile
sioux
especially
as
just
before
leaving
minnesota
some
of
the
tribe
had
scalped
three
sioux
indians
thinking
it
would
propitiate
them
in
the
kind
regards
of
their
great
father
at
washington
and
as
a
consequence
they
would
perhaps
be
permitted
to
remain
in
minnesota
the
removal
was
accomplished
in
may
and
june
there
were
all
told
of
the
winnebagoes
they
arrived
to
find
themselves
in
an
almost
barren
dry
hard
soil
too
strong
for
ploughs
so
much
so
that
it
was
difficult
to
get
a
plough
to
run
a
whole
day
without
breaking
a
drought
had
parched
the
grass
so
that
in
many
places
where
the
previous
year
several
tons
of
good
hay
to
an
acre
had
been
raised
there
was
not
now
pasturage
for
a
horse
the
cottonwood
timber
all
which
could
be
procured
was
crooked
difficult
to
handle
full
of
rots
etc
the
channel
of
the
missouri
river
here
was
so
changeable
and
the
banks
so
low
that
it
was
dangerous
to
get
too
near
they
were
obliged
therefore
to
settle
half
a
mile
away
from
the
river
no
wonder
that
on
july
the
winnebagoes
are
reported
as
not
pleased
with
their
location
and
anxious
to
return
to
minnesota
or
to
some
other
place
among
the
whites
they
gathered
together
in
council
and
requested
superintendent
thompson
to
write
to
their
great
father
for
permission
to
move
among
the
whites
again
they
have
lived
so
long
among
the
whites
that
they
are
more
afraid
of
wild
indians
than
the
whites
are
the
superintendent
hopes
however
they
will
be
more
contented
as
soon
as
he
can
get
them
comfortable
buildings
but
on
july
we
find
sulley
commander
of
the
expedition
against
indians
writing
to
the
department
in
behalf
of
these
unfortunate
creatures
general
sulley
having
been
detained
in
camp
near
crow
creek
on
account
of
the
low
water
the
chiefs
had
gone
to
him
with
their
tale
of
misery
they
stated
that
nothing
would
grow
here
they
dare
not
go
out
to
hunt
for
fear
of
other
tribes
and
they
would
all
starve
to
death
this
i
believe
to
be
true
without
the
government
intends
to
ration
them
all
the
time
the
land
is
sandy
dry
and
parched
up
the
land
is
poor
a
low
sandy
soil
i
do
think
you
can
depend
on
a
crop
of
corn
even
once
in
five
years
as
it
seldom
rains
here
in
the
summer
i
find
them
hard
at
work
making
canoes
with
the
intention
of
quitting
the
agency
and
going
to
join
the
omahas
or
some
other
tribe
down
the
river
they
said
they
had
been
promised
to
be
settled
on
the
big
sioux
river
i
told
them
they
must
stay
here
till
they
get
permission
from
washington
to
move
that
if
they
attempted
it
they
would
be
fired
on
by
my
troops
stationed
down
the
river
this
is
a
graphic
picture
of
the
condition
of
a
band
of
two
thousand
human
beings
for
whose
benefit
had
just
been
realized
from
sale
of
their
lands
by
the
government
to
say
nothing
of
the
property
they
owned
in
lands
yet
unsold
and
in
annuity
provisions
of
previous
treaties
to
the
amount
of
over
capital
is
not
their
long
suffering
their
patience
incredible
spite
of
the
dread
of
being
fired
on
by
the
united
states
troops
they
continued
to
make
canoes
and
escape
in
them
from
this
new
home
in
the
desert
and
in
october
the
department
of
the
interior
began
to
receive
letters
containing
paragraphs
like
this
i
have
also
to
report
that
small
detachments
of
winnebagoes
are
constantly
arriving
in
canoes
locating
on
our
reserve
and
begging
for
food
to
keep
them
from
starving
for
omaha
these
are
the
men
who
only
one
year
before
had
been
living
in
comfortable
homes
with
several
hundred
acres
of
good
ground
under
cultivation
and
clamoring
for
certificates
of
their
allotted
shelterless
worse
than
homeless
escaping
by
under
fire
of
united
states
soldiers
from
a
barren
desert
and
clamoring
for
food
at
indian
agencies
the
department
of
the
interior
promptly
reports
to
the
superintendent
of
indian
affairs
in
minnesota
this
information
and
calls
it
astounding
the
department
had
presumed
that
agent
balcombe
would
adopt
such
measures
as
would
induce
the
winnebagoes
to
remain
upon
their
reservation
and
had
understood
that
ample
arrangements
had
been
made
for
their
subsistence
it
however
ordered
the
omaha
agent
to
feed
the
starving
refugees
till
spring
and
it
sent
word
to
those
still
remaining
on
the
reservation
that
they
must
not
undertake
to
remove
without
the
consent
of
their
great
father
as
it
is
his
determination
that
a
home
that
shall
be
healthy
pleasant
and
fertile
shall
be
furnished
to
them
at
the
earliest
practicable
moment
this
was
in
the
autumn
of
in
one
year
no
less
than
of
the
destitute
winnebagoes
had
escaped
and
made
their
way
to
the
omaha
reservation
in
nebraska
here
the
superintendent
of
the
northern
superintendency
held
a
council
with
them
they
expressed
he
says
a
strong
desire
to
have
some
arrangement
made
by
which
they
would
be
allowed
to
occupy
a
portion
of
that
reservation
it
was
represented
that
the
omahas
wished
it
also
i
found
that
i
could
not
gain
their
consent
to
go
back
to
their
reservation
and
i
had
no
means
within
my
reach
of
forcing
them
back
even
if
i
had
deemed
it
proper
to
do
so
the
superintendent
recommended
therefore
that
they
be
subsisted
where
they
were
until
some
arrangement
be
made
for
their
satisfaction
or
some
concert
of
action
agreed
upon
between
the
war
department
and
the
interior
department
by
which
they
can
be
kept
on
their
reservation
after
they
shall
have
been
moved
there
in
september
of
this
same
year
the
agent
for
the
winnebago
reserve
wrote
that
the
absence
of
a
protecting
force
had
been
one
of
the
reasons
of
the
indians
leaving
in
such
numbers
both
the
winnebagoes
and
sioux
who
have
stayed
here
have
lived
in
fear
and
trembling
close
to
the
stockade
and
have
refused
to
separate
and
live
upon
separate
tracts
of
land
he
gives
some
further
details
as
to
the
soil
and
climate
the
region
has
been
subject
as
a
general
rule
to
droughts
and
the
destructive
visits
of
grasshoppers
and
other
insects
the
soil
has
a
great
quantity
of
alkali
in
it
it
is
an
excessively
dry
climate
it
very
seldom
rains
and
dews
are
almost
unknown
here
almost
destitute
of
timber
it
is
generally
supposed
that
game
is
plenty
about
here
this
is
an
erroneous
impression
there
are
but
a
very
few
small
streams
an
entire
absence
of
lakes
and
an
almost
entire
destitution
of
whole
country
being
one
wilderness
of
dry
prairie
for
hundreds
of
miles
around
hence
there
is
but
a
very
little
small
game
fish
or
wild
fruit
to
be
found
in
former
times
the
buffalo
roamed
over
this
country
but
they
have
receded
and
very
seldom
come
here
in
any
numbers
the
indians
must
have
horses
to
hunt
them
horses
they
have
not
the
winnebagoes
had
some
when
they
first
arrived
but
they
were
soon
stolen
by
the
hostile
sioux
agent
balcombe
must
have
led
a
hard
life
on
this
reservation
exposed
to
all
the
inconveniences
of
a
remote
frontier
three
hundred
miles
from
any
country
receiving
letters
from
the
interior
department
expressing
itself
astounded
that
he
does
not
induce
the
indians
in
his
charge
to
remain
on
their
reservation
and
letters
from
citizens
and
petitions
from
towns
in
wisconsin
minnesota
iowa
and
nebraska
imploring
him
to
gather
up
all
the
wandering
winnebagoes
who
have
been
left
behind
unprovided
with
any
proper
military
protection
and
surrounded
by
hostile
wonder
that
he
recommends
to
the
government
to
remove
and
consolidate
the
different
tribes
of
indians
into
one
territory
as
soon
as
possible
the
effects
of
this
sojourn
in
the
wilderness
upon
the
winnebagoes
were
terrible
not
only
were
they
rendered
spiritless
and
desperate
by
sufferings
they
were
demoralized
by
being
brought
again
into
conflict
with
the
wild
sioux
they
had
more
than
one
skirmish
with
them
and
it
is
said
relapsed
so
far
into
the
old
methods
of
their
barbaric
life
that
at
one
of
their
dances
they
actually
roasted
and
ate
the
heart
of
a
sioux
prisoner
yet
in
less
than
a
year
after
they
were
gathered
together
once
more
on
the
omaha
reservation
and
began
again
to
have
hopes
of
a
permanent
home
we
find
their
chiefs
and
headmen
sending
the
following
petition
to
washington
our
great
father
at
washington
all
greeting
the
chiefs
braves
and
headmen
of
your
dutiful
children
the
winnebagoes
father
we
can
not
see
you
you
are
far
away
from
us
we
can
not
speak
to
you
we
will
write
to
you
and
father
we
hope
you
will
read
our
letter
and
answer
us
father
some
years
ago
when
we
had
our
homes
on
turkey
river
we
had
a
school
for
our
children
where
many
of
them
learned
to
read
and
write
and
work
like
white
people
and
we
were
happy
father
many
years
have
passed
away
since
our
school
was
broken
up
we
have
no
such
schools
among
us
and
our
children
are
growing
up
in
ignorance
of
those
things
that
should
render
them
industrious
prosperous
and
happy
and
we
are
sorry
father
it
is
our
earnest
wish
to
be
so
situated
no
longer
it
is
our
sincere
desire
to
have
again
established
among
us
such
a
school
as
we
see
in
operation
among
your
omaha
children
father
as
soon
as
you
find
a
permanent
home
for
us
will
you
not
do
this
for
us
and
father
as
we
would
like
our
children
taught
the
christian
religion
as
before
we
would
like
our
school
placed
under
the
care
of
the
presbyterian
board
of
foreign
missions
and
last
father
to
show
you
our
sincerity
we
desire
to
have
set
apart
for
its
establishment
erection
and
support
all
of
our
and
whatever
more
is
necessary
father
this
is
our
prayer
will
not
you
open
your
ears
and
heart
to
us
and
write
to
us
this
letter
was
signed
by
of
the
chiefs
and
headmen
of
the
winnebagoes
in
march
a
new
treaty
was
made
between
the
united
states
and
this
tribe
of
indians
by
which
in
consideration
of
their
ceding
selling
and
conveying
to
the
united
states
all
their
right
in
the
dakota
reserve
the
united
states
agreed
to
set
apart
for
the
occupation
and
future
home
of
the
winnebago
indians
forever
a
certain
tract
of
acres
in
part
of
the
omaha
reservation
which
the
omahas
were
willing
to
sell
the
united
states
also
agreed
to
erect
mills
break
land
furnish
certain
amounts
of
seeds
tools
guns
and
horses
oxen
and
wagons
and
to
subsist
the
tribe
for
one
year
as
some
small
reparation
for
the
terrible
losses
and
sufferings
they
had
experienced
from
this
word
forever
the
winnebagoes
perhaps
took
courage
at
the
time
of
their
removal
from
minnesota
among
the
fugitives
who
fled
back
to
wisconsin
was
the
chief
de
carry
he
died
there
two
years
later
in
great
poverty
he
was
very
old
but
remarkably
intelligent
he
was
the
grandson
of
or
glory
of
the
morning
who
was
the
queen
of
the
winnebagoes
in
when
captain
carver
visited
the
tribe
there
is
nothing
in
carver
quaint
and
fascinating
old
story
more
interesting
than
his
account
of
the
winnebago
country
he
stayed
with
them
four
days
and
was
entertained
by
them
in
a
very
distinguished
manner
indeed
if
we
may
depend
upon
captain
story
all
the
tribes
were
in
their
own
country
a
gracious
and
hospitable
people
he
says
i
received
from
every
tribe
of
them
the
most
hospitable
and
courteous
treatment
and
am
convinced
that
till
they
are
contaminated
by
the
example
and
spirituous
liquors
of
their
more
refined
neighbors
they
will
retain
this
friendly
and
inoffensive
conduct
toward
strangers
he
speaks
with
great
gusto
of
the
bread
that
the
winnebago
women
made
from
the
wild
maize
the
soft
young
kernels
while
full
of
milk
are
kneaded
into
a
paste
the
cakes
wrapped
in
leaves
and
baked
in
the
ashes
better
flavored
bread
i
never
ate
in
any
country
says
the
honest
captain
he
found
the
winnebagoes
home
truly
delightful
the
shores
of
the
lake
were
wooded
with
hickory
oak
and
hazel
grapes
plums
and
other
fruits
grew
in
abundance
the
lake
abounded
in
fish
and
in
the
fall
of
the
year
with
geese
ducks
and
teal
the
latter
much
better
flavored
than
those
found
nearer
the
sea
as
they
acquire
their
excessive
fatness
by
feeding
on
the
wild
rice
which
grows
so
plentifully
in
these
parts
how
can
we
bear
to
contrast
the
picture
of
this
peace
plenty
and
gracious
hospitality
among
the
ancient
winnebagoes
with
the
picture
of
their
two
generations
driven
starved
and
how
can
we
bear
to
contrast
the
picture
of
the
drunken
gambling
winnebago
of
minnesota
with
this
picture
which
captain
carver
gives
of
a
young
winnebago
chief
with
whom
he
journeyed
for
a
few
days
captain
carver
after
a
four
days
visit
with
the
winnebagoes
and
having
made
some
presents
to
the
good
old
queen
and
received
her
blessing
went
on
his
way
two
months
later
as
he
was
travelling
to
the
falls
of
anthony
he
encountered
a
young
winnebago
chief
going
on
an
embassy
to
some
of
the
bands
of
the
nadouwessies
sioux
this
young
chief
finding
that
captain
carver
was
about
to
visit
the
falls
agreed
to
accompany
him
his
curiosity
having
been
often
excited
by
the
accounts
he
had
received
from
some
of
his
chiefs
he
accordingly
left
his
family
for
the
indians
never
travel
without
their
households
at
this
place
under
charge
of
my
mohawk
servant
and
we
proceeded
together
by
land
attended
only
by
my
frenchman
to
this
celebrated
place
we
could
distinctly
hear
the
noise
of
the
water
full
fifty
miles
before
we
reached
the
falls
and
i
was
greatly
pleased
and
surprised
when
i
approached
this
astonishing
work
of
nature
but
i
was
not
long
at
liberty
to
indulge
these
emotions
my
attention
being
called
off
by
the
behavior
of
my
companion
the
prince
had
no
sooner
gained
the
point
that
overlooks
this
wonderful
cascade
than
he
began
with
an
audible
voice
to
address
the
great
spirit
one
of
whose
places
of
residence
he
imagined
this
to
be
he
told
him
that
he
had
come
a
long
way
to
pay
his
adorations
to
him
and
now
would
make
him
the
best
offerings
in
his
power
he
accordingly
threw
his
pipe
into
the
stream
then
the
roll
that
contained
his
tobacco
after
these
the
bracelets
he
wore
on
his
arms
and
wrists
next
an
ornament
that
encircled
his
neck
composed
of
beads
and
wires
and
at
last
the
from
his
ears
in
short
he
presented
to
his
god
every
part
of
his
dress
that
was
valuable
during
this
he
frequently
smote
his
breast
with
great
violence
threw
his
arms
about
and
appeared
to
be
much
agitated
all
this
while
he
continued
his
adorations
and
at
length
concluded
them
with
fervent
petitions
that
the
great
spirit
would
constantly
afford
us
his
protection
on
our
travels
giving
us
a
bright
sun
a
blue
sky
and
clear
untroubled
waters
nor
would
he
leave
the
place
till
we
had
smoked
together
with
my
pipe
in
honor
of
the
great
spirit
i
was
greatly
surprised
at
beholding
an
instance
of
such
elevated
devotion
in
so
young
an
indian
indeed
the
whole
conduct
of
this
young
prince
at
once
charmed
and
amazed
me
during
the
few
days
we
were
together
his
attention
seemed
to
be
totally
employed
in
yielding
me
every
assistance
in
his
power
and
even
in
so
short
a
time
he
gave
me
innumerable
proofs
of
the
most
generous
and
disinterested
friendship
so
that
on
our
return
i
parted
from
him
with
the
greatest
reluctance
in
the
report
from
the
winnebagoes
is
that
they
are
improving
manifest
a
good
degree
of
industry
that
the
health
of
the
tribe
is
generally
poor
but
as
good
as
can
be
expected
when
we
remember
their
exposures
and
sufferings
during
the
last
three
years
the
tribe
has
diminished
some
four
or
five
hundred
since
they
left
minnesota
one
hundred
soldiers
have
returned
who
have
served
with
credit
to
themselves
and
to
their
tribe
in
the
defence
of
their
country
no
school
has
yet
been
established
on
the
agency
and
this
is
said
to
be
their
greatest
want
the
superintendent
writes
the
appropriations
under
the
late
treaty
have
all
been
made
and
the
work
of
fitting
up
the
reservation
is
progressing
it
affords
me
the
highest
personal
satisfaction
to
assure
the
department
that
this
and
tribe
will
soon
be
in
all
respects
comfortable
and
they
entered
upon
their
new
reservation
late
last
may
and
during
the
present
year
they
have
raised
at
least
twenty
thousand
bushels
of
corn
in
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
says
the
winnebagoes
have
a
just
claim
against
the
government
on
account
of
their
removal
from
minnesota
the
expenses
of
which
borne
out
of
their
own
tribal
the
government
is
clearly
bound
in
all
honor
to
refund
to
them
moneys
thus
expended
it
would
seem
that
there
could
have
been
no
question
in
the
beginning
as
to
who
should
pay
the
costs
of
such
a
removal
as
that
it
should
not
even
have
been
a
tax
on
the
general
government
but
on
the
state
of
minnesota
which
demanded
as
there
was
no
shadow
of
doubt
that
the
demand
was
because
the
citizens
of
minnesota
had
any
real
fear
of
the
peaceable
and
kindly
winnebagoes
who
were
as
much
in
terror
of
the
sioux
as
they
were
themselves
but
because
they
coveted
the
splendid
country
the
winnebagoes
were
occupying
and
the
sioux
difficulties
furnished
the
pretext
to
get
rid
of
them
with
the
aid
of
congressional
legislation
some
members
of
the
tribe
who
remained
in
minnesota
still
claimed
their
allotted
lands
their
share
of
all
moneys
payable
to
the
winnebagoes
under
treaty
stipulations
and
that
their
share
of
the
funds
of
the
tribe
be
capitalized
and
paid
to
them
in
bulk
their
peculiar
relations
as
indians
be
dissolved
and
they
left
to
merge
themselves
in
the
community
where
they
have
cast
their
lot
the
commissioner
urges
upon
the
government
compliance
with
these
requests
in
a
school
was
opened
on
the
winnebago
agency
and
had
a
daily
attendance
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
scholars
the
tribe
adopted
a
code
of
laws
for
their
government
and
the
year
was
one
of
peace
and
quietness
with
the
exception
of
some
dissatisfaction
on
the
part
of
the
indians
in
regard
to
three
hundred
cows
which
having
been
sent
to
the
agency
in
fulfilment
of
one
of
the
provisions
of
the
treaty
were
nevertheless
ordered
by
the
indian
bureau
to
be
kept
as
department
stock
the
indians
very
naturally
held
that
they
had
a
right
to
these
cows
nevertheless
they
continued
peaceable
and
contented
in
the
feeling
that
they
had
at
last
found
a
home
where
they
might
hope
to
remain
and
cultivate
the
soil
with
the
feeling
that
it
is
theirs
and
that
their
children
will
not
in
a
few
days
be
driven
from
their
and
productive
lands
they
are
however
growing
exceedingly
anxious
for
the
allotment
of
their
lands
in
severalty
in
preparations
were
being
made
for
allotting
the
lands
to
heads
of
families
in
the
allotment
of
land
in
severalty
to
the
indians
has
been
nearly
completed
each
head
of
a
family
receiving
eighty
acres
the
indians
anxiously
look
for
the
patents
to
these
as
many
have
already
commenced
making
improvements
at
least
thirty
have
broken
four
acres
of
prairie
apiece
and
several
have
built
houses
three
schools
are
in
operation
and
four
hundred
acres
of
ground
under
cultivation
in
this
year
comes
also
an
interesting
report
from
the
stray
winnebagoes
left
behind
in
wisconsin
they
and
the
stray
pottawattomies
who
are
in
the
same
neighborhood
are
remarkably
quiet
and
inoffensive
giving
no
cause
of
complaint
on
the
contrary
the
towns
and
villages
where
they
trade
their
berries
are
deriving
considerable
benefit
from
them
a
number
have
been
employed
in
lumbering
harvesting
and
a
number
of
and
lumbermen
have
informed
me
that
the
indians
they
have
employed
in
their
business
have
been
steady
good
hands
there
are
nearly
one
thousand
of
these
winnebagoes
some
of
them
have
bought
land
others
are
renting
it
and
all
express
an
anxiety
that
the
father
should
give
them
a
reservation
in
this
region
and
allow
them
to
remain
in
the
nebraska
winnebagoes
deposed
their
old
chiefs
and
elected
twelve
new
ones
to
serve
one
year
these
were
mainly
from
the
younger
members
of
the
tribe
who
were
in
favor
of
civilization
and
progress
this
was
an
important
step
toward
breaking
up
the
old
style
of
tribal
relations
in
we
hear
again
from
the
strays
in
wisconsin
the
whites
having
complained
of
them
congress
has
appropriated
funds
to
move
them
to
their
respective
tribes
west
of
the
mississippi
but
the
removal
has
not
been
undertaken
for
various
reasons
and
the
commissioner
doubts
whether
it
can
be
accomplished
without
additional
and
severe
legislation
on
the
part
of
congress
as
the
indians
are
attached
to
the
country
and
express
great
repugnance
to
their
contemplated
removal
from
it
the
poor
creatures
are
not
wanted
anywhere
spite
of
their
being
steady
good
hands
for
hired
labor
and
useful
to
towns
and
villages
in
furnishing
fruits
and
fish
the
wisconsin
people
do
not
want
them
in
their
state
and
the
agent
of
the
winnebago
reservation
writes
earnestly
protesting
against
their
being
brought
there
he
thinks
they
are
in
moral
tone
far
below
the
indians
under
his
charge
moreover
he
says
the
prejudice
in
the
surrounding
country
is
such
that
he
believes
it
would
be
bad
policy
to
remove
any
more
indians
there
nebraska
does
not
like
indians
any
better
than
wisconsin
does
or
minnesota
did
he
adds
also
that
his
indians
would
be
greatly
stimulated
to
improve
their
claims
if
they
could
secure
the
titles
for
them
they
have
waited
three
years
since
the
first
allotments
were
made
it
is
difficult
to
make
them
believe
that
it
requires
so
long
a
time
to
prepare
the
patents
and
they
are
beginning
to
fear
that
they
are
not
coming
in
the
winnebagoes
are
cited
as
a
striking
example
of
what
can
be
accomplished
in
a
comparatively
short
time
in
the
way
of
civilizing
and
christianizing
indians
their
beautiful
tract
of
country
is
dotted
over
with
cottages
the
farmers
own
their
wagons
horses
harness
furniture

their

civilized

several
hundred
winnebago
men
assisted
the
farmers
in
adjoining
counties
during
the
late
harvest
in

their
grain
crop
and
proved
themselves
efficient
and
satisfactory
workmen

moved
down
to

reservation
they
were
discontented
fomented
dissatisfaction
in
the
tribe
and
in
less
than
a
year
more
than
half
of
them
had
wandered
back
to
wisconsin
again
a
striking
instance
of
the
differences
in
the
government
methods
of
handling
different
bands
of
indians
the
thirty
poncas
who
ran
away
from
indian
territory
were
pursued
and
arrested
as
if
they
had
been
thieves
escaping
with
stolen
property
but
more
than
five
hundred
winnebagoes
in
less
than
one
year
stroll
away
from
their
reserve
make
their
way
back
to
wisconsin
and
nothing
is
done
about
it
in
there
are
only
two
hundred
and
four
of
the
wisconsin
strays
left
on
the
nebraska
reservation
all
the
others
are
back
in
their
old
haunts
where
a
few
seem
to
be
making
a
sincere
effort
to
take
care
of
themselves
by
taking

under

the
nebraska
winnebagoes
are
reported
as
being
nearly
civilized
all
are
engaged
in
civilized
pursuits
the
men
working
with
their
own
hands
and
digging
out
of
the

of
their
subsistence
they
have
raised
in
this
year
bushels
of

well
the

in
their
turn
select
twelve
indians
to

for
the

they

in
maintaining

in
six
years
six
years
ago
there
were

homes
and
only

in

and

reported
again
as
fast
emerging
from

condition
of

upon
their
annual
appropriations

does
this

differ
from
the

an

in
which
just
such
a
class
of
worthless

persons
will
be
found
and
so
crowded
are
these
almshouses
and
so
appreciable
a
burden
is
their
support
on
the
of
state
and
county
that
there
are
perpetual
disputes
going
on
between
the
authorities
of
neighboring
districts
as
to
the
ownership
and
responsibility
of
individual
paupers
for
the
paupers
in

persons
who
have
had

invested
for

the
interest
to
be

annually
forever
it
is
for
nobody
interest
to
keep
them
paupers
or
to
take
care
of
them
as
such
we
now
find
the
winnebagoes
once
more
quietly
established
in
comfortable
they
were
in
their
own
primitive
fashion
in
when
morse
visited
them
on
the
shores
of
their
beautiful
lake
as
they
were
after
our
civilized
fashion
in
on
the
healthful
and
fertile
of
minnesota
in
their
present
home
they
seem
to
have
reason
at
last
to
feel
secure
to
anticipate
permanence
safety
and
success
their
lands
have
been
allotted
to
them
in
severalty
each
head
of
a
family
has
his
patent
for
eighty
acres
they
are
in
the
main
how
does
the
united
states
government
welcome
this
success
this
heroic
triumph
of
a
patient
people
over
disheartening
obstacles
and
sufferings
in
the
annual
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
for
the
secretary
says
as
a
matter
of
economy
the
greatest
saving
could
be
made
by
uniting
all
the
indians
upon
a
few
reservations
the
fewer
the
better
he
says
that
there
is
land
enough
in
the
indian
territory
to
give
every
woman
and
the
country
acres
apiece
he
says
the
arguments
are
all
in
favor
of
the
consolidation
he
then
goes
on
to
enumerate
those
arguments
expensive
agencies
would
be
abolished
the
indians
themselves
can
be
more
easily
watched
over
and
controlled
men
be
the
better
kept
away
from
them
and
illicit
trade
and
barter
in
arms
and
ammunition
and
whiskey
prevented
goods
could
be
supplied
at
a
greater
saving
the
military
service
relieved
the
indians
better
taught
and
friendly
rivalry
established
among
most
civilized
hastening
the
progress
of
those
below
them
and
of
the
land
now
occupied
as
reserves
reverting
to
the
general
government
would
be
open
to
entry
and
here
are
nine
reasons
given
for
removing
all
indians
to
indian
territory
five
of
these
reasons
ostensibly
point
to
benefits
likely
to
accrue
from
this
removal
to
the
indians
the
other
four
point
to
benefits
likely
to
accrue
to
the
government
the
first
three
of
these
last
are
simply
saving
the
fourth
is
the
significant
one
gain
most
of
the
land
reverting
to
the
general
government
would
be
open
to
entry
and
sale
it
was
before
this
necessity
of
opening
indian
lands
to
entry
and
sale
that
the
winnebagoes
had
been
fleeing
from
to
it
seems
they
are
no
safer
now
there
is
evidently
as
much
reason
for
moving
them
out
of
nebraska
as
there
was
for
moving
them
out
of
wisconsin
and
minnesota
the
secretary
goes
on
to
say
as
soon
as
the
indian
is
taught
to
toil
for
his
daily
bread
and
realize
the
sense
of
proprietorship
in
the
results
of
his
labor
it
can
not
but
be
further
to
his
advantage
to
be
able
to
appreciate
that
his
labor
is
expended
upon
his
individual
possessions
and
for
his
personal
benefit
the
indian
must
be
made
to
see
the
practical
advantage
to
himself
of
his
work
and
feel
that
he
reaps
the
full
benefit
of
it
everything
should
teach
him
that
he
has
a
home
a
of
his
own
around
which
he
can
gather
his
family
and
in
its
possession
be
entirely
secure
and
independent
the
logical
relation
of
these
paragraphs
to
the
preceding
one
is
striking
and
the
bearing
of
the
two
together
on
the
case
of
the
winnebagoes
is
still
more
striking
in
the
same
report
the
commissioner
for
indian
affairs
says
if
legislation
were
secured
giving
the
president
authority
to
remove
any
tribe
or
band
or
any
portion
of
a
tribe
or
band
whenever
in
his
judgment
it
was
practicable
to
any
one
of
the
reservations
named
and
if
congress
would
appropriate
from
year
to
year
a
sum
sufficient
to
enable
him
to
take
advantage
of
every
favorable
opportunity
to
make
such
removals
i
am
confident
that
a
few
years
trial
would
conclusively
demonstrate
the
entire
feasibility
of
the
plan
i
believe
that
all
the
indians
in
kansas
nebraska
and
dakota
and
a
part
at
least
of
those
in
wyoming
and
montana
could
be
induced
to
remove
to
the
indian
territory
he
adds
that
the
indian
sentiment
is
opposed
to
such
removal
is
true
but
he
thinks
that
with
a
fair
degree
of
persistence
the
removal
can
be
secured
no
doubt
it
can
later
in
the
same
report
under
the
head
of
allotments
in
severalty
he
says
it
is
doubtful
whether
any
high
degree
of
civilization
is
possible
without
individual
ownership
of
land
the
records
of
the
past
and
the
experience
of
the
present
testify
that
the
soil
should
be
made
secure
to
the
individual
by
all
the
guarantees
which
law
can
devise
and
that
nothing
less
will
induce
men
to
put
forth
their
best
exertions
it
is
essential
that
each
individual
should
feel
that
his
home
is
his
own
that
he
has
a
direct
personal
interest
in
the
soil
on
which
he
lives
and
that
that
interest
will
be
faithfully
protected
for
him
and
for
his
children
by
the
government
the
commissioner
and
the
secretary
who
wrote
these
clear
statements
of
evident
truths
and
these
eloquent
pleas
for
the
indians
rights
both
knew
perfectly
well
that
hundreds
of
indians
had
had
lands
allotted
to
them
in
precisely
this
way
and
had
gone
to
work
on
the
lands
so
allotted
trusting
that
that
interest
would
be
faithfully
protected
by
the
government
and
that
these
allotments
and
the
certificates
of
them
had
proved
to
be
good
for
nothing
as
soon
as
the
citizens
of
a
state
united
in
a
demand
that
the
indians
should
be
moved
the
commissioner
and
the
secretary
knew
perfectly
well
at
the
time
they
wrote
these
paragraphs
that
in
this
one
winnebago
tribe
in
nebraska
for
instance
every
head
of
a
family
owned
eighty
acres
of
land
and
was
hard
at
work
on
trying
to
establish
that
around
which
as
the
secretary
says
he
must
gather
his
family
and
in
its
possession
be
entirely
secure
and
independent
and
yet
the
secretary
and
the
commissioner
advise
the
moving
of
this
winnebago
tribe
to
indian
territory
with
the
rest
all
the
indians
in
kansas
nebraska
and
dakota
could
probably
be
induced
to
move
they
say
these
quotations
from
this
report
of
the
interior
department
are
but
a
fair
specimen
of
the
velvet
glove
of
phrase
of
philanthropic
and
humane
care
for
the
indian
by
which
has
been
most
effectually
hid
from
the
sight
of
the
american
people
the
iron
hand
of
injustice
and
cruelty
which
has
held
him
for
a
hundred
years
helpless
in
its
grasp
in
this
same
year
an
agent
on
one
of
the
nebraska
agencies
writes
feelingly
and
sensibly
nothing
has
tended
to
retard
the
progress
of
this
tribe
in
the
line
of
opening
farms
for
themselves
so
much
as
the
unsettlement
occasioned
by
a
continued
agitation
of
the
subject
of
selling
their
reservation
and
the
removal
of
the
tribe
the
improvement
that
has
been
made
at
this
agency
during
the
past
three
years
in
the
direction
of
developing
among
the
indians
the
means
of
seems
to
have
caused
an
uneasiness
that
has
been
prolific
of
a
great
deal
of
annoyance
inasmuch
as
it
has
alarmed
this
speculative
element
around
us
with
the
fear
that
the
same
continued
will
eventually
plant
the
indians
on
their
present
fertile
land
so
firmly
that
they
can
not
be
removed
and
thus
they
be
deprived
of
the
benefits
of
manipulating
the
sale
of
their
reservation
nevertheless
the
winnebagoes
keep
on
in
their
houses
many
of
them
of
brick
made
on
the
ground
in
this
year
they
experienced
a
great
injustice
in
the
passing
of
an
act
of
congress
fixing
the
total
amount
to
be
expended
for
pay
of
employés
at
any
one
agency
at
not
more
than
this
necessitated
the
closing
of
the
fine
building
they
had
built
at
a
cost
of
for
the
purpose
of
an
industrial
in
this
year
report
their
agent
gives
a
resumé
of
the
financial
condition
of
the
tribe
by
treaty
proclaimed
june
the
winnebagoes
ceded
to
the
united
states
all
their
land
east
of
the
mississippi
in
consideration
of
which
they
were
to
receive
the
balance
of
this
after
making
certain
payments
was
to
be
invested
for
their
benefit
on
which
the
united
states
guaranteed
to
pay
them
an
annual
interest
of
not
less
than
five
per
cent
the
winnebagoes
receive
no
support
from
the
government
other
than
from
the
interest
appropriated
annually
on
what
remains
of
these
funds
this
in
amounted
to
over
since
then
the
numbering
one
hundred
and
sixty
persons
members
of
the
tribe
remaining
in
minnesota
at
the
time
of
the
removal
of
the
indians
from
that
state
in
have
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
the
act
making
appropriations
for
the
indian
service
approved
march
been
paid
their
proportion
of
the
principal
of
all
winnebago
funds
as
shown
on
the
books
of
the
treasury
at
that
time
including
the
proportion
of
on
which
but
five
more
instalments
of
interest
were
to
be
paid
per
fourth
article
treaty
october
in
computing
this
proportion
the
whole
number
of
the
tribe
considered
as
being
entitled
to
participate
in
the
benefits
of
the
tribal
funds
was
which
number
included
only
those
located
on
the
winnebago
reservation
in
nebraska
at
that
time
in
addition
to
the
one
hundred
and
sixty
already
spoken
of
by
this
act
of
congress
the
nebraska
winnebagoes
who
comprise
only
that
portion
of
the
tribe
which
has
complied
with
treaty
stipulations
and
quietly
acquiesced
in
the
demands
of
the
government
were
deprived
of
nearly
part
of
their
accustomed
support
other
reductions
were
afterward
made
for
the
purchase
of
a
reservation
adjoining
the
old
one
in
this
state
and
for
removing
to
it
the
wandering
bands
of
winnebagoes
in
wisconsin
these
were
supposed
to
have
numbered
in
all
nearly
one
thousand
persons
they
had
not
been
in
the
habit
of
receiving
any
attention
or
acknowledgment
from
the
government
since
they
as
a
tribal
organization
had
declined
to
treat
with
it
nearly
all
of
them
objected
to
removing
from
wisconsin
to
their
new
reservation
in
nebraska
and
as
a
natural
consequence
soon
returned
after
being
compelled
to
do
so
at
the
present
time
there
are
probably
less
than
one
hundred
of
the
number
remaining
here
for
the
past
three
years
the
sum
to
which
the
wisconsin
winnebagoes
would
have
been
entitled
had
they
remained
on
their
reservation
amounting
in
all
to
has
been
set
apart
awaiting
such
act
of
congress
as
will
give
relief
in
the
premises
thus
reducing
the
total
amount
received
per
annum
by
that
portion
of
the
tribe
living
on
the
reservation
to
but
little
more
than
of
what
it
was
seven
years
ago
it
seems
needless
to
say
that
they
are
very
much
dissatisfied
at
this
and
that
when
they
refer
to
the
subject
i
have
some
difficulty
in
satisfying
them
as
to
the
justice
of
the
governmental
policy
in
setting
apart
funds
to
be
expended
at
some
future
time
for
the
benefit
of
certain
individuals
who
persist
in
absenting
themselves
from
their
reservation
while
others
who
are
absent
but
a
few
months
are
deprived
of
all
advantages
from
issues
of
supplies
or
payments
that
may
have
been
made
during
their
absence
this
case
is
a
good
illustration
of
the
working
of
the
trustee
relation
between
the
united
states
government
and
its
wards
in
we
find
the
secretary
of
the
interior
still
recommending
that
the
indians
be
gradually
gathered
together
on
smaller
reservations
to
the
end
that
greater
facilities
be
afforded
for
civilization
he
reiterates
that
the
enjoyment
and
pride
of
individual
ownership
of
property
is
one
of
the
most
effective
civilizing
agencies
and
recommends
that
allotments
of
small
tracts
of
land
should
be
made
to
the
heads
of
families
on
all
reservations
to
be
held
in
severalty
under
proper
restrictions
so
that
they
may
have
fixed
homes
the
commissioner
also
recommends
a
steady
concentration
of
the
smaller
bands
of
indians
on
the
larger
reservations
he
calls
attention
again
to
the
fact
that
there
are
square
miles
in
the
indian
territory
set
apart
for
the
use
of
indians
and
that
there
they
can
be
fed
and
clothed
at
a
greatly
diminished
expense
and
better
than
all
can
be
kept
in
obedience
and
taught
to
become
civilized
and
in
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
reports
that
a
bill
has
been
drawn
providing
for
the
removal
and
consolidation
of
certain
indians
in
the
states
of
oregon
colorado
iowa
kansas
nebraska
wisconsin
and
minnesota
and
the
territories
of
washington
and
dakota
a
reduction
of
reservations
and
eleven
agencies
will
thus
be
effected
there
will
be
restored
to
the
public
domain
acres
of
land
he
says
that
further
consolidations
of
like
character
are
not
only
possible
but
expedient
and
advisable
there
is
a
vast
area
of
land
in
the
indian
territory
not
yet
occupied
with
the
same
ludicrous
complacent
logic
as
before
he
proceeds
to
give
as
the
reason
for
uprooting
all
these
indians
from
the
homes
where
they
are
beginning
to
thrive
and
take
root
and
moving
them
the
third
fourth
fifth
sixth
or
seventh
time
as
it
may
fact
that
among
the
most
radical
defects
of
the
policy
formerly
pursued
with
the
indians
has
been
the
frequent
changes
in
their
location
which
have
been
made
permanent
homes
sufficient
aid
to
enable
them
to
build
houses
cultivate
the
soil
and
to
subsist
them
until
they
have
harvested
their
first
crops
will
wean
them
entirely
from
their
old
methods
of
life
and
in
the
course
of
a
few
years
enable
them
to
become
entirely
among
the
more
forcible
arguments
which
can
be
presented
in
connection
with
this
subject
is
the
fact
that
the
expenses
attending
the
removal
and
consolidation
of
the
indians
as
herein
proposed
be
more
than
met
from
the
sale
of
lands
much
of
the
land
now
owned
by
these
indians
is
valuable
only
for
its
timber
and
may
be
sold
at
an
appraised
value
for
an
amount
far
in
excess
of
the
price
fixed
by
law
and
yet
leave
a
large
margin
of
profit
to
the
purchaser
into
whose
hands
the
lands
will
fall
i
can
see
no
reason
why
the
government
should
not
avail
itself
of
these
facts
and
in
effecting
the
consolidation
of
the
indians
and
the
opening
of
the
lands
for
settlement
sell
the
same
for
an
amount
sufficient
to
support
the
indians
in
their
new
locations
without
any
actual
drain
on
the
treasury
in
the
future
the
lands
belong
to
the
indians
and
they
are
clearly
entitled
to
receive
the
full
value
of
the
same
when
sold
in
this
sentence
we
reach
the
mark
of
the
sophistry
and
dishonesty
of
the
department
position
the
lands
belong
to
the
indians
but
we
will
compel
them
to
restore
to
the
public
domain
to
give
up
to
white
settlers
acres
of
them
the
indians
are
clearly
entitled
to
receive
the
full
value
of
the
same
when
sold
but
we
will
compel
them
to
expend
that
full
value
in
removing
to
a
place
where
they
do
not
want
to
go
opening
new
lands
building
new
houses
buying
new
utensils
implements
furniture
and
stock
and
generally
establishing
themselves
without
any
actual
drain
on
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
and
the
department
of
the
interior
can
see
no
reason
why
the
government
should
not
avail
itself
of
these
facts
all
this
is
proposed
with
a
view
to
the
benefit
of
the
indians
the
report
goes
on
to
reiterate
the
same
old
story
that
the
indians
must
have
a
perfect
title
to
their
lands
that
they
have
come
to
feel
that
they
are
at
any
time
liable
to
be
moved
whenever
the
pressure
of
white
settlers
upon
them
may
create
a
demand
for
their
lands
and
that
they
decline
to
make
any
improvements
on
their
lands
even
after
an
allotment
in
severalty
has
been
made
until
they
have
received
their
patents
for
the
same
and
that
even
after
the
issue
of
patents
the
difficulties
surrounding
them
do
not
cease
evidently
not
since
as
we
have
seen
it
is
now
several
years
since
every
head
of
a
family
among
these
winnebagoes
whose
removal
the
commissioner
now
recommends
secured
his
patent
for
eighty
acres
of
land
finally
the
commissioner
says
every
means
that
human
ingenuity
can
devise
legal
or
illegal
has
been
resorted
to
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
possession
of
indian
lands
of
this
there
would
seem
to
be
left
no
doubt
in
the
mind
of
any
intelligent
person
after
reading
the
above
quotations
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
that
when
the
news
of
such
schemes
as
these
reaches
the
indians
on
their
reservations
great
alarm
and
discontent
are
the
result
we
find
in
the
reports
from
the
nebraska
agencies
for
this
year
unmistakable
indications
of
disheartenment
and
anxiety
the
winnebagoes
are
reported
to
be
very
anxious
to
be
made
citizens
a
majority
are
in
favor
of
it
provided
the
government
will
adopt
certain
measures
which
they
consider
necessary
for
the
care
and
protection
of
their
property
they
have
had
a
striking
illustration
of
the
disadvantage
of
not
being
citizens
in
an
instance
of
the
unpunished
murder
of
one
of
their
number
by
a
white
man
the
story
is
related
by
the
agent
tersely
and
well
and
is
one
of
the
notable
incidents
in
the
history
of
the
relation
between
the
united
states
government
and
its
wards
henry
harris
a
winnebago
in
good
standing
an
industrious
man
and
a
successful
farmer
was
employed
by
joseph
smith
a
white
man
to
cut
wood
on
his
land
in
dakota
county
a
short
distance
north
of
the
reservation
while
alone
and
thus
engaged
on
the
of
last
january
harris
was
shot
through
the
heart
with
a
i
had
his
dead
body
taken
before
the
coroner
of
the
county
and
at
the
inquest
held
before
that
officer
it
was
shown
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
jury
that
rendered
a
verdict
in
accordance
therewith
that
the
indian
came
to
his
death
at
the
hands
of
one
balinska
who
had
been
for
many
years
leading
a
hermit
life
on
a
tract
of
land
that
he
owned
adjoining
the
reservation
and
who
had
threatened
harris
life
a
few
months
before
when
they
quarrelled
about
damages
for
corn
destroyed
by
horse
there
being
snow
on
the
ground
at
the
time
of
the
murder
balinska
was
tracked
from
his
home
to
the
place
where
under
cover
he
did
the
shooting
and
his
containing
a
moulded
ball
of
the
same
weight
as
the
one
cut
from
the
body
of
the
indian
was
found
near
by
and
identified
notwithstanding
this
direct
evidence
which
was
laid
before
the
of
dakota
county
that
honorable
body
was
unwilling
to
find
a
bill
for
the
reason
as
i
understand
that
it
was
only
an
indian
that
was
killed
and
it
would
not
be
popular
to
incur
the
expense
of
bringing
the
case
to
trial
this
is
but
another
illustration
of
the
difficulty
of
punishing
a
white
man
for
a
wrong
committed
against
an
indian
i
need
hardly
say
that
the
indians
when
comparing
this
murder
with
that
of
a
white
man
committed
eight
years
ago
by
five
of
their
young
upon
less
direct
evidence
were
sentenced
to
imprisonment
in
the
state
penitentiary
for
struck
with
the
wonderful
difference
in
the
application
of
the
same
law
to
whites
and
indians
the
report
from
the
winnebago
agency
for
tells
the
story
of
the
sequel
to
this
unpunished
murder
of
henry
harris
the
agent
says
in
my
last
report
i
referred
to
the
murder
of
one
of
our
best
indian
farmers
by
a
white
man
who
was
afterward
arrested
and
discharged
without
trial
though
there
was
no
question
as
to
his
guilt
as
a
sequel
to
this
one
white
man
is
known
to
have
been
killed
last
may
by
holly
scott
a
nephew
of
the
murdered
indian
and
another
white
man
is
supposed
to
have
been
killed
by
eddy
priest
and
thomas
walker
two
young
indians
who
have
left
for
wisconsin
the
murdered
white
men
had
temporarily
stopped
with
the
indians
their
antecedents
are
unknown
and
they
are
supposed
to
have
belonged
to
the
fraternity
of
tramps
holly
scott
was
arrested
by
the
indian
police
and
turned
over
to
the
authorities
of
dakota
county
for
trial
the
state
legislature
having
at
its
last
session
extended
the
jurisdiction
of
that
county
over
this
reservation
by
what
authority
i
am
unable
to
say
the
effect
of
these
murders
was
to
unsettle
the
indians
nearly
all
industry
being
suspended
for
several
weeks
they
feared
that
the
white
people
would
do
as
they
did
in
minnesota
in
after
the
sioux
massacre
when
the
winnebagoes
were
driven
from
their
homes
in
minnesota
a
number
of
our
most
quiet
and
industrious
men
became
alarmed
and
moved
their
families
to
wisconsin
encouraged
in
so
doing
by
the
hope
of
receiving
from
the
government
a
share
of
the
funds
which
have
been
set
apart
from
the
annual
appropriations
during
the
past
four
years
for
the
benefit
of
the
wisconsin
winnebagoes
and
which
they
suppose
aggregate
a
large
amount
which
will
soon
be
paid
in
cash
this
brings
the
story
of
the
winnebagoes
down
to
the
present
time
what
its
next
chapter
may
be
is
saddening
to
think
it
is
said
by
those
familiar
with
the
nebraska
indians
that
civilized
though
they
be
they
will
all
make
war
to
the
knife
if
the
attempt
is
made
by
the
government
to
rob
them
of
their
present
lands
on
the
plea
again
of
offering
them
a
permanent
home
that
specious
pretence
has
done
its
last
duty
in
the
united
states
service
no
indian
is
left
now
so
imbecile
as
to
believe
it
once
more
whether
the
winnebagoes
patents
in
nebraska
would
in
such
a
case
prove
any
stronger
than
did
their
certificates
in
minnesota
and
whether
the
winnebagoes
themselves
peaceable
and
civilized
though
they
be
would
side
with
the
united
states
government
or
with
their
wronged
and
desperate
brethren
in
such
an
uprising
it
would
be
hard
to
predict
chapter
viii
the
cherokees
the
cherokees
were
the
eastern
mountaineers
of
america
their
country
lay
along
the
tennessee
river
and
in
the
highlands
of
georgia
carolina
and
loveliest
region
east
of
the
mississippi
river
beautiful
and
grand
with
lofty
mountains
and
rich
valleys
fragrant
with
flowers
and
forests
of
magnolia
and
pine
filled
with
the
singing
of
birds
and
the
melody
of
streams
rich
in
fruits
and
nuts
and
wild
grains
it
was
a
country
worth
loving
worth
fighting
worth
dying
for
as
thousands
of
its
lovers
have
fought
and
have
died
white
men
as
well
as
red
within
the
last
hundred
years
when
oglethorpe
came
with
his
cargo
of
madeira
wine
and
respectable
paupers
from
england
in
and
lived
in
tents
in
midwinter
on
the
shores
of
the
savannah
river
one
of
the
first
conditions
of
safety
for
his
colossal
almshouse
in
shape
of
a
new
colony
was
that
all
the
indians
in
the
region
should
become
its
friends
and
allies
the
reputation
of
his
goodness
and
benevolence
soon
penetrated
to
the
fastnesses
of
their
homes
and
tribe
after
tribe
sent
chiefs
and
headmen
to
greet
him
with
gifts
and
welcome
when
the
cherokee
chief
appeared
oglethorpe
said
to
him
fear
nothing
speak
freely
i
always
speak
freely
answered
the
mountaineer
why
should
i
fear
i
am
now
among
friends
i
never
feared
even
among
my
enemies
the
principal
intention
of
the
english
trustees
who
incorporated
the
georgia
colony
was
to
provide
a
home
for
worthy
persons
in
england
who
were
in
decayed
circumstances
among
other
great
ends
which
they
also
avowed
was
the
civilization
of
the
savages
in
one
of
first
reports
to
the
trustees
he
says
a
little
indian
only
one
within
fifty
not
only
in
amity
but
desirous
to
be
subjects
to
his
majesty
king
george
to
have
lands
given
to
them
among
us
and
to
breed
their
children
at
our
schools
their
chief
and
his
beloved
man
who
is
the
second
man
in
the
nation
desire
to
be
instructed
in
the
christian
religion
the
next
year
he
returned
to
england
carrying
with
him
eight
indian
chiefs
to
show
them
so
much
of
great
britain
and
her
institutions
as
might
enable
them
to
judge
of
her
power
and
dignity
nothing
was
neglected
we
are
told
that
was
likely
to
awaken
their
curiosity
or
impress
them
with
a
sense
of
the
power
and
grandeur
of
the
nation
they
were
received
by
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
and
by
the
fellows
of
eton
and
for
a
space
of
four
months
were
hospitably
entertained
and
shown
all
the
great
sights
of
london
and
its
vicinity
the
tribes
at
home
were
much
gratified
by
these
attentions
paid
to
their
representatives
and
sent
out
to
the
trustees
a
very
curious
missive
expressing
their
thanks
and
their
attachment
to
general
oglethorpe
this
letter
was
the
production
of
a
young
cherokee
chief
it
was
written
in
black
and
red
hieroglyphs
on
a
dressed
before
it
was
sent
to
england
it
was
exhibited
in
savannah
and
the
meaning
of
the
hieroglyphs
translated
by
an
interpreter
in
a
grand
gathering
of
fifty
indian
chiefs
and
all
the
principal
people
of
savannah
afterward
the
curious
document
was
framed
and
hung
up
in
the
georgia
office
in
westminster
when
the
wesleyan
missionaries
arrived
in
georgia
two
years
later
some
of
the
chiefs
who
had
made
this
visit
to
england
went
to
meet
them
carrying
large
jars
of
honey
and
of
milk
as
gifts
to
represent
their
inclinations
and
one
of
the
chiefs
said
to
wesley
i
am
glad
you
are
come
when
i
was
in
england
i
desired
that
some
one
would
speak
the
great
word
to
me
i
will
go
up
and
speak
to
the
wise
men
of
our
nation
and
i
hope
they
will
hear
but
we
would
not
be
made
christians
as
the
spaniards
make
christians
we
would
be
taught
before
we
are
baptized
in
those
early
days
wesley
was
an
intolerant
and
injudicious
enthusiast
his
missionary
work
in
the
georgia
colony
was
anything
but
successful
in
the
outset
either
among
the
whites
or
the
indians
and
there
was
ample
justification
for
the
reply
which
this
same
indian
chief
made
later
when
urged
to
embrace
the
doctrines
of
christianity
why
these
are
christians
at
savannah
those
are
christians
at
frederica
christians
get
drunk
christians
beat
men
christians
tell
lies
me
no
christian
on
another
occasion
wesley
asked
him
what
he
thought
he
was
made
for
he
that
is
above
answered
the
chief
knows
what
he
made
us
for
we
know
nothing
we
are
in
the
dark
but
white
men
know
much
and
yet
white
men
build
great
houses
as
if
they
were
to
live
forever
but
white
men
can
not
live
forever
in
a
little
time
white
men
will
be
dust
as
well
as
i
for
twenty
years
oglethorpe
colony
struggled
on
under
great
difficulties
and
discouragements
wars
with
france
and
with
spain
tiresome
squabbles
with
and
among
methodist
missionaries
all
combined
to
make
oglethorpe
position
hard
again
and
again
england
would
have
lost
her
colony
except
for
the
unswerving
fidelity
of
the
indian
allies
they
gathered
by
hundreds
to
fight
for
oglethorpe
in
one
expedition
against
the
frontier
four
hundred
creeks
and
six
hundred
cherokees
set
out
in
one
day
under
an
urgent
call
for
help
sent
by
indian
runners
to
their
towns
his
indian
friends
were
the
only
friends
oglethorpe
had
who
stood
by
him
past
everything
nothing
could
shake
their
fidelity
he
is
poor
he
can
give
you
nothing
said
the
augustine
spaniards
to
a
creek
chief
at
this
time
it
is
foolish
for
you
to
go
to
him
and
they
showed
to
the
indian
a
fine
suit
of
scarlet
clothes
and
a
sword
which
they
were
about
to
give
to
a
chief
of
the
tennessees
who
had
become
their
ally
but
the
creek
answered
we
love
him
it
is
true
he
does
not
give
us
silver
but
he
gives
us
everything
we
want
that
he
has
he
has
given
me
the
coat
off
his
back
and
the
blanket
from
under
him
at
last
the
trustees
of
the
georgia
colony
lost
patience
very
bitterly
they
had
learned
that
paupers
however
worthy
are
not
good
stuff
to
build
new
enterprises
of
in
eighteen
years
the
colony
had
not
once
furnished
a
sufficient
supply
of
subsistence
for
its
own
consumption
farms
which
had
been
cultivated
were
going
to
ruin
and
the
country
was
rapidly
degenerating
in
every
respect
dishonest
traders
had
tampered
with
and
exasperated
the
indians
so
that
their
friendliness
could
no
longer
be
implicitly
trusted
for
everything
that
went
wrong
the
english
company
was
held
responsible
and
probably
there
were
no
happier
men
in
all
england
on
the
of
june
than
were
the
georgia
trustees
who
on
that
day
formally
resigned
their
charter
and
washed
their
hands
of
the
colony
forever
the
province
was
now
formed
into
a
royal
government
and
very
soon
became
the
seat
of
frightful
indian
wars
the
new
authorities
neither
understood
nor
kept
faith
with
the
indians
their
old
friend
oglethorpe
had
left
them
forever
and
the
same
scenes
of
treachery
and
massacre
which
were
being
enacted
at
the
north
began
to
be
repeated
with
similarity
at
the
south
indians
fighting
as
allies
with
the
french
with
the
english
treaties
made
and
broken
as
soon
as
made
there
was
neither
peace
nor
safety
anywhere
at
last
in
a
treaty
was
concluded
with
the
chiefs
and
headmen
of
five
tribes
which
seemed
to
promise
better
things
the
cherokees
and
creeks
granted
to
the
king
of
england
a
large
tract
of
land
cleared
off
their
debts
with
the
sum
paid
for
it
and
observed
its
stipulations
faithfully
for
several
years
until
peace
was
again
destroyed
this
time
by
no
fault
of
the
indians
in
consequence
of
the
revolt
of
the
american
colonies
against
great
britain
the
english
loyalists
in
georgia
now
availed
themselves
of
the
indians
old
habit
of
allegiance
to
the
crown
one
of
their
leading
agents
took
a
cherokee
woman
as
his
mistress
placed
her
at
the
head
of
his
table
gave
her
the
richest
dress
and
equipage
that
the
country
could
afford
and
distributed
through
her
lavish
gifts
to
all
the
indians
he
could
reach
when
war
actually
broke
out
he
retreated
with
her
into
the
fastnesses
of
the
cherokee
nation
where
he
swayed
them
at
his
will
attempts
to
capture
him
were
repelled
by
the
cherokees
with
ferocity
prisoners
taken
by
them
at
this
time
were
tortured
with
great
cruelty
one
instance
is
recorded
in
a
journal
kept
by
another
prisoner
who
escaped
alive
of
a
boy
about
twelve
years
of
age
who
was
suspended
by
the
arms
between
two
posts
and
raised
about
three
feet
from
the
ground
the
mode
of
inflicting
the
torture
was
by
splints
of
about
eighteen
inches
long
made
sharp
at
one
end
and
fractured
at
the
other
so
that
the
torch
might
not
be
extinguished
by
throwing
it
after
these
weapons
of
death
were
prepared
and
a
fire
made
for
the
purpose
of
lighting
them
the
scene
of
horror
commenced
it
was
deemed
a
mark
of
dexterity
and
accompanied
by
shouts
of
applause
when
an
indian
threw
one
of
these
torches
so
as
to
make
the
sharp
end
stick
into
the
body
of
the
suffering
youth
without
extinguishing
the
torch
this
description
of
torture
was
continued
for
two
hours
before
the
innocent
victim
was
relieved
by
death
these
are
sickening
details
and
no
doubt
will
be
instinctively
set
down
by
most
readers
as
proof
of
innate
cruelty
peculiar
to
the
indian
race
let
us
therefore
set
side
by
side
with
them
the
record
that
in
this
same
war
white
men
british
officers
confined
white
men
rebels
in
starved
and
otherwise
maltreated
them
till
they
died
five
or
six
a
day
then
threw
their
dead
bodies
into
the
nearest
marsh
and
had
them
down
in
the
whence
they
were
soon
exposed
by
the
washing
of
the
tides
and
at
the
prisoners
beheld
the
picking
the
bones
of
their
departed
companions
also
that
white
men
british
officers
were
known
at
that
time
to
have
made
out
of
to
torture
georgia
women
wives
of
rebels
to
force
them
to
reveal
the
places
where
their
husbands
were
in
hiding
innate
cruelty
is
not
exclusively
an
indian
trait
the
cherokees
had
the
worst
of
the
fighting
on
the
british
side
during
the
revolution
again
and
again
their
towns
were
burnt
their
winter
stores
destroyed
and
whole
bands
reduced
to
the
verge
of
starvation
at
one
time
when
hard
pressed
by
the
american
forces
they
sent
to
the
creeks
for
help
but
the
shrewd
creeks
replied
you
have
taken
the
thorns
out
of
our
feet
you
are
welcome
to
them
the
creeks
having
given
only
limited
aid
to
the
british
had
suffered
much
less
severely
that
any
of
the
indians
should
have
joined
the
rebel
cause
seems
wonderful
as
they
had
evidently
nothing
to
gain
by
the
transfer
of
their
allegiance
to
what
must
have
appeared
to
them
for
a
long
time
to
be
the
losing
side
in
the
contest
for
three
years
and
a
half
savannah
was
in
the
possession
of
the
british
and
again
and
again
they
had
control
of
the
entire
state
and
to
show
that
they
had
no
compunction
about
inciting
the
indians
to
massacres
they
left
many
a
written
for
instance
as
this
which
is
in
a
letter
written
by
general
gage
from
boston
june
we
need
not
be
tender
of
calling
on
the
savages
to
attack
the
americans

the
first
diplomatic
relations
of
the
united
states
government
with
the
cherokees
were
in
the
making
of
the
treaty
of
hopewell
in
at
the
hopewell
council
the
united
states
commissioners
said
congress
is
now
the
sovereign
of
all
our
country
which
we
now
point
out
to
you
on
the
map
they
want
none
of
your
lands
nor
anything
else
which
belongs
to
you
and
as
an
earnest
of
their
regard
for
you
we
propose
to
enter
into
articles
of
a
treaty
perfectly
equal
and
conformable
to
what
we
now
tell
you
this
humane
and
generous
act
of
the
united
states
will
no
doubt
be
received
by
you
with
gladness
and
held
in
grateful
remembrance
and
the
more
so
as
many
of
your
young
men
and
the
greater
number
of
your
warriors
during
the
late
war
were
our
enemies
and
assisted
the
king
of
great
britain
in
his
endeavors
to
conquer
our
country
the
chiefs
complained
bitterly
of
the
encroachments
of
white
settlers
upon
lands
which
had
been
by
old
treaties
distinctly
reserved
to
the
cherokees
they
demanded
that
some
of
these
settlers
should
be
removed
and
when
the
commissioners
said
that
the
settlers
were
too
numerous
for
the
government
to
remove
one
of
the
chiefs
asked
satirically
are
congress
who
conquered
the
king
of
great
britain
unable
to
remove
those
people
finally
the
chiefs
agreed
to
accept
payment
for
the
lands
which
had
been
taken
new
boundaries
were
established
and
a
general
feeling
of
and
confidence
was
created
one
notable
feature
in
this
council
was
the
speech
of
an
indian
woman
called
the
of
chota
chota
was
the
cherokees
city
of
refuge
all
murderers
were
safe
so
long
as
they
lived
in
chota
even
englishmen
had
not
disdained
to
take
advantage
of
its
shelter
one
english
trader
who
had
killed
an
indian
having
fled
lived
there
for
many
months
his
own
house
being
but
a
short
distance
away
after
a
time
he
resolved
to
return
home
but
the
headmen
of
the
tribe
assured
him
that
though
he
was
entirely
safe
there
he
would
surely
be
killed
if
he
left
the
town
the
chief
who
brought
this
to
the
council
introduced
her
as
one
of
our
beloved
women
who
has
borne
and
raised
up
warriors
she
proceeded
to
say
i
am
fond
of
hearing
that
there
is
a
peace
and
i
hope
you
have
now
taken
us
by
the
hand
in
real
friendship
i
have
a
pipe
and
a
little
tobacco
to
give
the
commissioners
to
smoke
in
friendship
i
look
on
you
and
the
red
people
as
my
children
your
having
determined
on
peace
is
most
pleasing
to
me
for
i
have
seen
much
trouble
during
the
late
war
i
am
old
but
i
hope
yet
to
bear
children
who
will
grow
up
and
people
our
nation
as
we
are
now
to
be
under
the
protection
of
congress
and
shall
have
no
disturbance
a
brief
summary
of
the
events
which
followed
on
the
negotiation
of
this
treaty
may
be
best
given
in
the
words
of
a
report
made
by
the
secretary
of
war
to
the
president
four
years
later
in
july
general
knox
writes
as
follows
of
the
cherokees
this
nation
of
indians
consisting
of
separate
towns
or
villages
are
seated
principally
on
the
of
the
tennessee
which
runs
into
the
ohio
their
extend
from
the
cumberland
river
along
the
frontiers
of
virginia
north
and
south
carolina
and
part
of
georgia
the
frequent
wars
they
have
had
with
the
frontier
people
of
the
said
states
have
greatly
diminished
their
number
the
commissioners
estimated
them
in
november
at
warriors
but
they
were
estimated
in
at
yet
it
is
probable
they
may
be
lessened
since
by
the
depredations
committed
on
them
the
united
states
concluded
a
treaty
with
the
cherokees
at
hopewell
on
the
keowee
the
of
november
which
is
entered
on
the
printed
journals
of
congress
april
the
negotiations
of
the
commissioners
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
are
hereunto
annexed
marked
a
it
will
appear
by
the
papers
marked
that
the
state
of
north
carolina
by
their
agent
protested
against
the
said
treaty
as
infringing
and
violating
the
legislative
rights
of
that
state
by
a
variety
of
evidence
which
has
been
submitted
to
the
last
congress
it
has
been
proved
that
the
said
treaty
has
been
entirely
disregarded
by
the
white
people
inhabiting
the
frontiers
styling
themselves
the
state
of
franklin
the
proceedings
of
congress
on
the
of
september
and
the
proclamation
they
then
issued
on
this
subject
will
show
their
sense
of
the
many
unprovoked
outrages
committed
against
the
cherokees
the
information
contained
in
the
papers
marked
from
colonel
joseph
martin
the
late
agent
to
the
cherokees
and
richard
winn
will
further
evince
the
deplorable
situation
of
the
cherokees
and
the
indispensable
obligation
of
the
united
states
to
vindicate
their
faith
justice
and
national
dignity
the
letter
of
winn
the
late
superintendent
of
the
of
march
informs
that
a
treaty
will
be
held
with
the
cherokees
on
the
third
monday
of
may
at
the
upper
on
french
broad
river
but
it
is
to
be
observed
that
the
time
for
which
both
he
and
colonel
joseph
martin
the
agent
to
the
cherokees
and
chickasaws
were
elected
has
expired
and
therefore
they
are
not
authorized
to
act
on
the
part
of
the
union
if
the
commissioners
appointed
by
north
carolina
south
carolina
and
georgia
by
virtue
of
the
resolve
of
congress
of
the
of
october
should
attend
the
said
treaty
their
proceedings
thereon
may
soon
be
expected
but
as
part
of
the
cherokees
have
taken
refuge
within
the
limits
of
the
creeks
it
is
highly
probable
they
will
be
under
the
same
direction
and
therefore
as
the
fact
of
the
violation
of
the
treaty
can
not
be
disputed
and
as
the
commissioners
have
not
power
to
replace
the
cherokees
within
the
limits
established
in
it
is
not
probable
even
if
a
treaty
should
be
held
as
stated
by
winn
that
the
result
would
be
satisfactory
this
is
the
summing
up
of
the
situation
the
details
of
it
are
to
be
read
in
copious
volumes
of
the
early
history
of
tennessee
north
and
south
carolina
and
under
the
head
of
indian
atrocities
to
very
few
who
read
those
records
does
it
occur
that
the
indians
who
committed
these
atrocities
were
simply
ejecting
by
force
and
in
the
contests
arising
from
this
forcible
ejectment
killing
men
who
had
usurped
and
stolen
their
ceded
to
them
by
the
united
states
government
in
a
solemn
treaty
of
which
the
fifth
article
was
as
follows
if
any
citizen
of
the
united
states
or
other
person
not
being
an
indian
shall
attempt
to
settle
on
any
of
the
lands
westward
or
southward
of
the
said
boundaries
which
are
hereby
allotted
to
the
indians
for
their
or
having
already
settled
and
will
not
remove
from
the
same
within
six
months
after
the
ratification
of
this
treaty
such
person
shall
forfeit
the
protection
of
the
united
states
and
the
indians
punish
him
or
not
as
they
it
is
evident
that
it
is
necessary
to
go
back
to
the
days
of
the
first
treaties
with
our
indians
to
possess
ourselves
of
the
first
requisites
for
fair
judgment
of
their
conduct
toward
white
men
what
would
a
community
of
white
men
situated
precisely
as
these
cherokees
were
have
done
what
did
these
very
southern
colonists
themselves
do
to
spaniards
who
encroached
on
their
lands
fought
them
killed
them
burnt
their
houses
over
their
heads
and
drove
them
into
the
sea
in
a
later
communication
in
the
same
year
to
the
president
the
secretary
says
the
disgraceful
violation
of
the
treaty
of
hopewell
with
the
cherokees
requires
the
serious
consideration
of
congress
if
so
direct
and
manifest
contempt
of
the
authority
of
the
united
states
be
suffered
with
impunity
it
will
be
in
vain
to
attempt
to
extend
the
arm
of
the
government
to
the
frontiers
the
indian
tribes
can
have
no
faith
in
such
imbecile
promises
and
the
lawless
whites
will
ridicule
a
government
which
shall
on
paper
only
make
indian
treaties
and
regulate
indian
boundaries
the
president
thus
entreated
addressed
himself
to
the
senate
and
asked
their
advice
he
recapitulated
the
facts
as
set
forth
by
general
knox
that
upward
of
five
hundred
families
are
settled
on
the
cherokee
lands
and
asks
is
it
the
judgment
of
the
senate
that
overtures
shall
be
made
to
the
cherokees
to
arrange
a
new
boundary
so
as
to
embrace
the
settlements
made
by
the
white
people
since
the
treaty
of
hopewell
in
november
if
so
shall
compensation
to
the
amount
of
annually
or
of
in
gross
be
made
to
the
cherokees
for
the
land
they
shall
relinquish
holding
the
occupiers
of
the
land
accountable
to
the
united
states
for
its
value
shall
the
united
states
stipulate
solemnly
to
guarantee
the
new
boundary
which
may
be
arranged
the
senate
thereupon
resolved
that
the
president
should
at
his
discretion
cause
the
hopewell
treaty
to
be
carried
out
or
make
a
new
one
but
in
case
a
new
one
was
made
the
senate
do
advise
and
consent
solemnly
to
guarantee
the
same
accordingly
in
july
a
new
treaty
of
made
with
the
cherokees
new
boundaries
established
and
a
year
promised
to
the
tribe
for
the
lands
relinquished
by
the
seventh
article
of
this
treaty
the
united
states
solemnly
guarantee
to
the
cherokee
nation
all
their
lands
not
hereby
ceded
the
eighth
article
reiterates
the
old
permission
that
if
any
citizen
of
the
united
states
or
other
person
not
an
indian
shall
settle
on
the
cherokees
lands
the
cherokees
may
punish
him
as
they
please
article
ninth
says
that
no
citizen
or
inhabitant
of
the
united
states
shall
hunt
or
destroy
game
on
the
cherokee
lands
or
go
into
the
cherokee
country
without
a
passport
from
the
governor
or
some
other
authorized
person
the
next
year
the
cherokees
sent
an
embassy
to
philadelphia
to
ask
for
an
increase
of
in
their
annuity
one
of
the
chiefs
said
that
he
had
told
governor
blunt
the
year
before
that
he
would
not
consent
to
selling
the
lands
for
a
year
it
would
not
buy
a
for
each
of
my
nation
which
was
literally
true
to
this
additional
annuity
the
senate
consented
and
with
this
the
chiefs
said
they
were
perfectly
satisfied
but
they
begged
for
the
ploughs
hoes
cattle
which
had
been
promised
in
the
treaty
they
said
game
is
going
fast
away
from
among
us
we
must
plant
corn
and
raise
cattle
and
we
want
you
to
assist
us
in
it
was
necessary
to
make
another
treaty
chiefly
to
declare
that
the
holston
treaty
was
in
full
force
and
binding
it
had
not
been
fully
carried
into
execution
by
reason
of
misunderstandings
it
was
said
this
was
very
true
white
settlers
had
gone
where
they
pleased
as
if
it
did
not

cherokees
had
murdered
them
as
they
were
by
their
treaty
explicitly
permitted
to
do
the
whites
had
retaliated
by
unprovoked
attacks
on
friendly
indians
and
the
indians
had
retaliated
again
the
exasperated
indians
implored
congress
to
protect
them
the
still
more
exasperated
whites
demanded
of
congress
to
protect
them
the
secretary
of
war
writes
despairingly
that
the
desire
of
too
many
frontier
white
people
to
seize
by
force
or
fraud
on
the
neighboring
indian
lands
continues
to
be
an
unceasing
cause
of
jealousy
and
hatred
on
the
part
of
the
indians
and
it
would
appear
upon
a
calm
investigation
that
until
the
indians
can
be
quieted
on
this
point
and
rely
with
confidence
on
the
protection
of
their
lands
by
the
united
states
no
hope
of
tranquillity
can
be
entertained
in
this
miserable
manner
unjust
equally
to
the
white
men
and
to
the
indians
affairs
went
on
for
several
years
until
in
it
became
absolutely
necessary
that
in
some
way
a
definite
understanding
of
boundaries
and
an
authoritative
enforcement
of
rights
on
both
sides
should
be
brought
about
accordingly
commissioners
were
sent
by
the
president
to
obtain
the
consent
of
the
cherokees
to
new
grants
of
land
and
establishment
of
boundaries
the
instructions
given
to
these
commissioners
are
remarkable
for
their
reiterated
assertion
of
the
indians
unquestioned
right
to
do
as
they
please
about
ceding
these
lands
such
phrases
as
these
should
the
indians
refuse
to
cede
to
the
united
states
any
of
the
lands
and
you
will
endeavor
to
prevail
upon
them
to
cede
and
you
will
endeavor
to
procure
the
consent
of
the
indians
are
proof
of
the
fulness
of
the
recognition
the
united
states
government
at
that
time
gave
of
the
indians
right
of
occupancy
also
of
the
realization
on
the
part
of
the
government
that
these
indian
nations
were
powers
whose
it
was
of
importance
to
conciliate
it
is
of
importance
the
instructions
say
that
the
indian
nations
generally
should
be
convinced
of
the
certainty
in
which
they
may
at
all
times
rely
upon
the
friendship
of
the
united
states
and
that
the
president
will
never
abandon
them
or
their
children
and
it
will
be
incumbent
on
you
to
introduce
the
desires
of
the
government
in
such
a
manner
as
will
permit
you
to
drop
them
as
you
may
find
them
illy
received
without
giving
the
indians
an
opportunity
to
reply
with
a
decided
negative
or
raising
in
them
unfriendly
and
inimical
dispositions
you
will
state
none
of
them
in
the
tone
of
demands
but
in
the
first
instance
merely
mention
them
as
propositions
which
you
are
authorized
to
make
and
their
assent
to
which
the
government
would
consider
as
new
testimonials
of
their
friendship
nevertheless
the
cherokees
did
reply
with
a
decided
negative
they
utterly
refused
to
cede
any
more
lands
or
to
give
their
consent
to
the
opening
of
any
more
roads
through
their
territory
but
it
only
took
four
years
to
bring
them
to
the
point
where
they
were
ready
to
acquiesce
in
the
wishes
of
the
government
and
to
make
once
more
the
effort
to
secure
to
themselves
an
unmolested
region
by
giving
up
several
large
tracts
of
land
and
a
right
of
way
on
several
roads
in
they
concluded
another
treaty
ceding
territory
for
which
the
united
states
thought
it
worth
while
to
pay
immediately
and
an
annuity
of
ten
years
later
in
they
gave
up
all
their
lands
in
south
carolina
and
the
united
states
became
surety
that
south
carolina
should
pay
to
them
for
the
same
in
the
autumn
of
the
same
year
they
made
still
another
cession
of
lands
to
the
united
states
government
for
which
they
were
to
have
an
annuity
of
a
year
for
ten
years
and
as
compensation
for
the
improvements
they
surrendered
in
an
important
treaty
was
concluded
making
still
further
cessions
of
lands
and
defining
the
position
of
a
part
of
the
cherokee
nation
which
had
moved
away
with
the
president
permission
to
the
arkansas
river
in
the
eighth
article
of
this
treaty
promises
that
the
united
states
will
give
to
every
head
of
an
indian
family
residing
on
the
east
side
of
the
mississippi
who
may
wish
to
become
a
citizen
a
reservation
of
six
hundred
and
forty
acres
of
land
in
which
they
will
have
a
life
estate
with
a
reversion
in
to
their
children
what
imagination
could
have
foreseen
that
in
less
than
twenty
years
the
chiefs
of
this
cherokee
nation
would
be
found
piteously
pleading
to
be
allowed
to
remain
undisturbed
on
these
very
lands
in
the
whole
history
of
our
government
dealings
with
the
indian
tribes
there
is
no
record
so
black
as
the
record
of
its
perfidy
to
this
nation
there
will
come
a
time
in
the
remote
future
when
to
the
student
of
american
history
it
will
seem
incredible
from
the
beginning
of
the
century
they
had
been
steadily
advancing
in
civilization
as
far
back
as
they
had
begun
the
manufacture
of
cotton
cloth
and
in
there
was
scarcely
a
family
in
that
part
of
the
nation
living
east
of
the
mississippi
but
what
understood
the
use
of
the
card
and
every
family
had
its
farm
under
cultivation
the
territory
was
laid
off
into
districts
with
a
a
judge
and
a
marshal
in
each
district
a
national
committee
and
council
were
the
supreme
authority
in
the
nation
schools
were
flourishing
in
all
the
villages
were
at
work
their
territory
was
larger
than
the
three
states
of
massachusetts
rhode
island
and
connecticut
combined
it
embraced
the
part
of
georgia
the
of
alabama
a
corner
of
tennessee
and
of
north
carolina
they
were
enthusiastic
in
their
efforts
to
establish
and
perfect
their
own
system
of
jurisprudence
missions
of
several
sects
were
established
in
their
country
and
a
large
number
of
them
had
professed
christianity
and
were
living
exemplary
lives
there
is
no
instance
in
all
history
of
a
race
of
people
passing
in
so
short
a
space
of
time
from
the
barbarous
stage
to
the
agricultural
and
civilized
and
it
was
such
a
community
as
this
that
the
state
of
georgia
by
one
outrage
made
outlaws
on
the
of
december
a
law
to
annul
all
laws
and
ordinances
made
by
the
cherokee
nation
of
indians
declaring
all
laws
ordinances
orders
and
regulations
of
any
kind
whatever
made
passed
or
enacted
by
the
cherokee
indians
either
in
general
council
or
in
any
other
way
whatever
or
by
any
authority
whatever
null
and
void
and
of
no
effect
as
if
the
same
had
never
existed
also
that
no
indian
or
descendant
of
any
indian
residing
within
the
creek
or
cherokee
nations
of
indians
shall
be
deemed
a
competent
witness
in
any
court
of
this
state
to
which
a
white
man
may
be
a
party
what
had
so
changed
the
attitude
of
georgia
to
the
indians
within
her
borders
simply
the
fact
that
the
indians
finding
themselves
hemmed
in
on
all
sides
by
fast
thickening
white
settlements
had
taken
a
firm
stand
that
they
would
give
up
no
more
land
so
long
as
they
would
cede
and
cede
and
grant
and
grant
tract
after
tract
and
had
millions
of
acres
still
left
to
cede
and
grant
the
selfishness
of
white
men
took
no
alarm
but
once
consolidated
into
an
empire
with
fixed
and
inalienable
boundaries
powerful
recognized
and
determined
the
cherokee
nation
would
be
a
thorn
in
the
flesh
to
her
white
neighbors
the
doom
of
the
cherokees
was
sealed
on
the
day
when
they
declared
once
for
all
officially
as
a
nation
that
they
would
not
sell
another
foot
of
land
this
they
did
in
an
interesting
and
pathetic
message
to
the
united
states
senate
in
georgia
through
her
governor
and
her
delegates
to
congress
had
been
persistently
demanding
to
have
the
cherokees
compelled
to
give
up
their
lands
she
insisted
that
the
united
states
government
should
fulfil
a
provision
made
in
an
old
compact
of
to
extinguish
the
indian
titles
within
her
limits
as
soon
as
it
could
be
peaceably
done
this
she
demanded
should
be
done
now
either
peaceably
or
otherwise
we
can
not
but
view
the
design
of
those
letters
says
this
message
as
an
attempt
bordering
on
a
hostile
disposition
toward
the
cherokee
nation
to
wrest
from
them
by
arbitrary
means
their
just
rights
and
liberties
the
security
of
which
is
solemnly
guaranteed
to
them
by
these
united
states
we
assert
under
the
fullest
authority
that
all
the
sentiments
expressed
in
relation
to
the
disposition
and
determination
of
the
nation
never
to
cede
another
foot
of
land
are
positively
the
production
and
voice
of
the
nation
there
is
not
a
spot
out
of
the
limits
of
any
of
the
states
or
territories
thereof
and
within
the
limits
of
the
united
states
that
they
would
ever
consent
to
inhabit
because
they
have
unequivocally
determined
never
again
to
pursue
the
chase
as
heretofore
or
to
engage
in
wars
unless
by
the
common
call
of
the
government
to
defend
the
common
rights
of
the
united
states
the
cherokees
have
turned
their
attention
to
the
pursuits
of
the
civilized
man
agriculture
manufactures
and
the
mechanic
arts
and
education
are
all
in
successful
operation
in
the
nation
at
this
time
and
while
the
cherokees
are
peacefully
endeavoring
to
enjoy
the
blessings
of
civilization
and
christianity
on
the
soil
of
their
rightful
inheritance
and
while
the
exertions
and
labors
of
various
religious
societies
of
these
united
states
are
successfully
engaged
in
promulgating
to
them
the
words
of
truth
and
life
from
the
sacred
volume
of
holy
writ
and
under
the
patronage
of
the
general
government
they
are
threatened
with
removal
or
extinction
we
appeal
to
the
magnanimity
of
the
american
congress
for
justice
and
the
protection
of
the
rights
and
liberties
and
lives
of
the
cherokee
people
we
claim
it
from
the
united
states
by
the
strongest
obligation
which
imposes
it
on
treaties
and
we
expect
it
from
them
under
that
memorable
declaration
all
men
are
created
equal
that
they
are
endowed
by
their
creator
with
certain
inalienable
rights
that
among
these
are
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
the
dignified
and
pathetic
remonstrances
of
the
cherokee
chiefs
their
firm
reiterations
of
their
resolve
not
to
part
with
their
lands
were
called
by
the
angry
georgian
governor
tricks
of
vulgar
cunning
and
insults
from
the
polluted
lips
of
outcasts
and
vagabonds
and
he
is
not
afraid
in
an
official
letter
to
the
secretary
of
war
to
openly
threaten
the
president
that
if
he
upholds
the
indians
in
their
rejection
of
the
overtures
for
removal
the
consequences
are
inevitable
and
that
in
resisting
the
occupation
of
the
cherokee
lands
by
the
georgians
he
will
be
obliged
to
make
war
upon
and
shed
the
blood
of
brothers
and
friends
to
these
cherokees
jefferson
had
written
at
one
time
during
his
administration
i
sincerely
wish
you
may
succeed
in
your
laudable
endeavors
to
save
the
remnant
of
your
nation
by
adopting
industrious
occupations
and
a
government
of
regular
law
in
this
you
may
always
rely
on
the
counsel
and
assistance
of
the
united
states
in
he
had
written
to
general
knox
defining
the
united
position
in
the
matter
of
indian
lands
government
should
firmly
maintain
this
ground
that
the
indians
have
a
right
to
the
occupation
of
their
lands
independent
of
the
states
within
whose
chartered
lines
they
happen
to
be
that
until
they
cede
them
by
treaty
or
other
transaction
equivalent
to
treaty
no
act
of
a
state
can
give
a
right
to
such
lands
the
government
is
determined
to
exert
all
its
energy
for
the
patronage
and
protection
of
the
rights
of
the
indians
and
the
year
before
general
washington
had
said
to
the
six
nations
in
future
you
can
not
be
defrauded
of
your
lands
no
state
or
person
can
purchase
your
lands
unless
at
some
public
treaty
held
under
the
authority
of
the
united
states
the
general
government
will
never
consent
to
your
being
defrauded
but
it
will
protect
you
in
all
your
just
rights
you
possess
the
right
to
sell
and
the
right
of
refusing
to
sell
your
lands
the
united
states
will
be
true
and
faithful
to
their
engagements
what
could
cherokee
men
and
women
have
thought
when
only
thirty
years
later
they
found
this
united
states
government
upholding
the
state
of
georgia
in
her
monstrous
pretensions
of
right
to
the
whole
of
their
country
and
in
her
infamous
cruelties
of
oppression
toward
them
when
they
found
this
united
states
government
sending
its
agents
to
seduce
and
bribe
their
chiefs
to
bargain
away
their
country
even
stooping
to
leave
on
the
public
records
of
official
instructions
to
a
commissioner
such
phrases
as
these
appeal
to
the
chiefs
and
influential
together
but
apart
at
their
own
houses
make
offers
to
them
of
extensive
reservations
in
and
other
rewards
to
obtain
their
acquiescence
the
more
careful
you
are
to
secure
from
even
the
chiefs
the
official
character
you
bear
the
better
enlarge
on
the
advantage
of
their
condition
in

west

the

would
protect
them

of
this
people
to
the
government
of
the

to
fulfil
its
promises
to
them
and
their
cause

majority
the

jeremiah
evarts
published
a
series
of
papers
in
the
under
the
signature
of
william
penn
in
which
he
gave
a
masterly
analysis
and
summing
up
of
the
case
recapitulated
the
sixteen
treaties
which
the
government
had
made
with
the
cherokees
all
guaranteeing
to
them
their
lands
and
declared
that
the
government
had
arrived
at
the
bank
of
the
rubicon
where
it
must
decide
if
it
would
or
would
not
save
the
country
from
the
charge
of
bad
faith
many
of
his
eloquent
sentences
read
in
the
light
of
the
present
time
like
prophecies
he
says
in
a
quarter
of
a
century
the
pressure
upon
the
indians
will
be
much
greater
from
the
boundless
prairies
which
must
ultimately
be
subdued
and
inhabited
than
it
would
ever
have
been
from
the
borders
of
the
present
cherokee
country
and
asks
pertinently
to
what
confidence
would
such
an
engagement
be
entitled
done
at
the
very
moment
that
treaties
with
indians
are
declared
not
to
be
binding
and
for
the
very
reason
that
existing
treaties
are
not
strong
enough
to
bind
the
united
states
remonstrances
poured
in
upon
congress
petitions
and
memorials
from
religious
societies
from
little
country
villages
all
imploring
the
government
to
keep
its
faith
to
these
people
the
cherokees
own
newspaper
was
filled
at
this
time
with
the
records
of
the
nation
suffering
and
despair
the
state
of
georgia
has
taken
a
strong
stand
against
us
and
the
united
states
must
either
defend
us
and
our
rights
or
leave
us
to
our
foe
in
the
latter
case
she
will
violate
her
promise
of
protection
and
we
can
not
in
future
depend
upon
any
guarantee
to
us
either
here
or
beyond
the
mississippi
if
the
united
states
shall
withdraw
their
solemn
pledges
of
protection
utterly
disregard
their
plighted
faith
deprive
us
of
the
right
of
and
wrest
from
us
our
land
then
in
the
deep
anguish
of
our
misfortunes
we
may
justly
say
there
is
no
place
of
security
for
us
no
confidence
left
that
the
united
states
will
be
more
just
and
faithful
toward
us
in
the
barren
prairies
of
the
west
than
when
we
occupied
the
soil
inherited
from
the
great
author
of
our
existence
as
a
last
resort
the
cherokees
carried
their
case
before
the
supreme
court
and
implored
that
body
to
restrain
the
state
of
georgia
from
her
unjust
interference
with
their
rights
the
reports
of
the
case
of
the
cherokee
nation
the
state
of
georgia
fill
a
volume
by
themselves
and
are
of
vital
importance
to
the
history
of
indian
affairs
the
majority
of
the
judges
decided
that
an
indian
tribe
could
not
be
considered
as
a
foreign
nation
and
therefore
could
not
bring
the
suit
judge
thompson
and
judge
story
dissented
from
this
opinion
and
held
that
the
cherokee
tribe
did
constitute
a
foreign
nation
and
that
the
state
of
georgia
ought
to
be
enjoined
from
execution
of
its
unjust
laws
the
opinion
of
chancellor
kent
coincided
with
that
of
judges
thompson
and
story
chancellor
kent
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
the
cases
in
which
the
supreme
court
had
jurisdiction
would
reach
and
embrace
every
controversy
that
can
arise
between
the
cherokees
and
the
state
of
georgia
or
its
officers
under
the
execution
of
the
act
of
georgia
but
all
this
did
not
help
the
cherokees
neither
did
the
fact
of
the
manifest
sympathy
of
the
whole
court
with
their
wrongs
the
technical
legal
decision
had
been
rendered
against
them
and
this
delivered
them
over
to
the
tender
mercies
of
georgia
no
power
in
the
land
could
help
them
fierce
factions
now
began
to
be
formed
in
the
nation
one
for
and
one
against
the
surrender
of
their
lands
many
were
ready
still
to
remain
and
suffer
till
death
rather
than
give
them
up
but
wiser
counsels
prevailed
and
in
the
last
days
of
the
year
a
treaty
was
concluded
with
the
united
states
by
twenty
of
the
cherokee
chiefs
and
headmen
who
thereby
in
behalf
of
their
nation
relinquished
all
the
lands
claimed
or
possessed
by
them
east
of
the
mississippi
river
the
preamble
of
this
treaty
is
full
of
pathos
the
cherokees
are
anxious
to
make
some
arrangement
with
the
government
of
the
united
states
whereby
the
difficulties
they
have
experienced
by
a
residence
within
the
settled
parts
of
the
united
states
under
the
jurisdiction
and
laws
of
the
state
governments
may
be
terminated
and
adjusted
and
with
a
view
to
reuniting
their
people
in
one
body
and
securing
a
permanent
home
for
themselves
and
their
posterity
in
the
country
selected
by
their
forefathers
without
the
territorial
limits
of
the
state
sovereignties
and
where
they
can
establish
and
enjoy
a
government
of
their
choice
and
perpetuate
such
a
state
of
society
as
may
be
most
consonant
with
their
views
habits
and
condition
and
as
may
tend
to
their
individual
comfort
and
their
advancement
in
civilization
by
this
treaty
the
cherokees
gave
up
a
country
larger
than
the
three
states
of
massachusetts
rhode
island
and
connecticut
combined
and
received
therefor
five
millions
of
dollars
and
seven
millions
of
acres
of
land
west
of
the
mississippi
this
the
united
states
guaranteed
and
secured
to
be
conveyed
in
patent
and
defined
it
by
exact
boundaries
and
in
addition
to
the
seven
millions
of
acres
of
land
thus
provided
for
and
bounded
the
united
states
did
further
guarantee
to
the
cherokee
nation
a
perpetual
outlet
west
and
a
free
and
unmolested
use
of
all
the
country
west
of
the
western
boundary
of
said
seven
millions
of
acres
as
far
west
as
the
sovereignty
of
the
united
states
and
their
rights
of
soil
extend
the
fifth
article
of
this
treaty
is
the
united
states
hereby
covenant
and
agree
that
the
lands
ceded
to
the
cherokee
nation
in
the
foregoing
article
shall
in
no
future
time
without
their
consent
be
included
within
the
territorial
limits
or
jurisdiction
of
any
state
or
territory
in
the
sixth
article
is
this
promise
the
united
states
agree
to
protect
the
cherokee
nation
from
domestic
strife
and
foreign
enemies
and
against
intestine
wars
between
the
several
tribes
even
after
this
treaty
was
made
a
great
part
of
the
nation
refused
to
sanction
it
saying
that
it
did
not
represent
their
wish
they
would
never
carry
it
out
hundreds
refused
to
receive
any
longer
either
money
or
supplies
from
the
united
states
agents
lest
they
should
be
considered
to
have
thereby
committed
themselves
to
the
treaty
in
general
wool
wrote
from
the
cherokee
country
that
the
people
uniformly
declare
that
they
never
made
the
treaty
in
question
so
determined
are
they
in
their
opposition
that
not
one
of
all
those
who
were
present
and
voted
in
the
council

but
a
day
or
two
since
at
this
place
however
poor
or
destitute
would
receive
either
rations
or
clothing
from
the
united
states
lest
they
might
compromise
themselves
in
regard
to
the
treaty
these
same
people
as
well
as
those
in
the
mountains
of
north
carolina
during
the
summer
past
preferred
living
on
the
roots
and
sap
of
trees
rather
than
receive

thousands

been
informed

for

for

the
very

allowed
them
by
the

lands
and
at
last
were
removed
only
by
military
force

scott
was
ordered
to
go
with
a
sufficient
military
force
to
compel
the
removal
his
proclamation
to
the
cherokee
people
remaining
in
north
carolina
georgia
tennessee
and
alabama
opens
thus
cherokees
president
of
the
united
states
has
sent
me
with
a
powerful
army
to
cause
you
in
obedience
to
the
treaty
of
to
join
that
part
of
your
people
who
are
already
established
on
the
other
side
of
the
mississippi
unhappily
the
two
years
which
were
allowed
for
the
purpose
you
have
suffered
to
pass
away
without
following
and
without
making
any
preparation
to
follow
and
now
or
by
the
time
that
this
solemn
address
shall
reach
your
distant
settlements
the
emigration
must
be
commenced
in
haste
but
i
hope
without
disorder
i
have
no
power
by
granting
a
further
delay
to
correct
the
error
that
you
have
committed
the
of
may
is
already
on
the
wane
and
before
another
shall
have
passed
away
every
cherokee
man
woman
and
child
in
those
states
must
be
in
motion
to
join
their
brethren
in
the
west
the
tone
of
this
proclamation
at
once
firm
and
kindly
could
not
fail
to
profoundly
impress
the
unfortunate
people
to
whom
it
was
addressed
my
troops
said
the
humane
and
sympathizing
general
already
occupy
many
positions
in
the
country
that
you
are
to
abandon
and
thousands
and
thousands
are
approaching
from
every
quarter
to
render
resistance
and
escape
alike
hopeless
all
those
troops
regular
and
militia
are
your
friends
receive
them
and
confide
in
them
as
such
obey
them
when
they
tell
you
that
you
can
remain
no
longer
in
this
country
soldiers
are
as
as
brave
and
the
desire
of
every
one
of
us
is
to
execute
our
painful
duty
in
mercy
chiefs
headmen
and
warriors
will
you
then
by
resistance
compel
us
to
resort
to
arms
god
forbid
or
will
you
by
flight
seek
to
hide
yourselves
in
mountains
and
forests
and
thus
oblige
us
to
hunt
you
down
remember
that
in
pursuit
it
may
be
impossible
to
avoid
conflicts
the
blood
of
the
white
man
or
the
blood
of
the
red
man
may
be
spilt
and
if
spilt
however
accidentally
it
may
be
impossible
for
the
discreet
and
humane
among
you
or
among
us
to
prevent
a
general
war
and
carnage
think
of
this
my
cherokee
brethren
i
am
an
old
warrior
and
have
been
present
at
many
a
scene
of
slaughter
but
spare
me
i
beseech
you
the
horror
of
witnessing
the
destruction
of
the
cherokees
do
not
even
wait
for
the
close
approach
of
the
troops
but
make
such
preparations
for
emigration
as
you
can
and
hasten
to
this
place
to
ross
landing
or
to
guinter
landing
where
you
will
be
received
in
kindness
by
officers
selected
for
the
purpose
this
is
the
address
of
a
warrior
to
warriors
may
its
entreaties
be
kindly
received
and
may
the
god
of
both
prosper
the
americans
and
cherokees
and
preserve
them
long
in
peace
and
friendship
with
each
other
the
reply
of
the
council
of
the
cherokee
nation
to
this
proclamation
is
worthy
to
be
put
on
record
they
make
no
further
protest
against
going
they
simply
ask
the
privilege
of
undertaking
the
whole
charge
of
the
removal
themselves
they
say
the
present
condition
of
the
cherokee
people
is
such
that
all
dispute
as
to
the
time
of
emigration
is
set
at
rest
being
already
severed
from
their
homes
and
their
property
their
persons
being
under
the
absolute
control
of
the
commanding
general
and
being
altogether
dependent
on
the
benevolence
and
humanity
of
that
high
officer
for
the
suspension
of
their
transportation
to
the
west
at
a
season
and
under
circumstances
in
which
sickness
and
death
were
to
be
apprehended
to
an
alarming
extent
all
inducements
to
prolong
their
stay
in
this
country
are
taken
away
and
however
strong
their
attachment
to
the
homes
of
their
fathers
may
be
their
interests
and
their
wishes
are
now
to
depart
as
early
as
may
be
consistent
with
their
safety
the
council
therefore
submitted
to
general
scott
several
propositions
that
the
cherokee
nation
will
undertake
the
whole
business
of
removing
their
people
to
the
west
of
the
river
mississippi
their
estimates
of
cost
and
arrangement
as
to
time
intervals
were
wise
and
reasonable
to
their
estimate
of
as
the
cost
for
every
thousand
persons
transported
general
scott
objected
thinking
it
high
he
said
that
he
was
confident
that
it
would
be
found
that
out
of
every
thousand
there
would
be
at
least
five
hundred
strong
men
women
boys
and
girls
not
only
capable
of
marching
twelve
or
fifteen
miles
a
day
but
to
whom
the
exercise
would
be
beneficial
and
another
hundred
able
to
go
on
foot
half
that
distance
daily
he
also
objected
to
the
estimate
of
the
ration
at
sixteen
cents
as
too
high
the
council
replied
that
they
believed
the
estimate
reasonable
having
the
comfortable
removal
of
our
people
solely
in
view
and
endeavoring
to
be
governed
as
far
as
that
object
will
allow
by
the
rates
of
expenditure
fixed
by
the
officers
of
the
government
after
the
necessary
bedding
and
other
indispensable
articles
of
twenty
four
or
five
placed
in
a
wagon
with
subsistence
for
at
least
two
days
the
weight
already
will
be
enough
to
exclude
in
our
opinion
more
than
a
very
few
persons
being
hauled
the
great
distance
to
be
travelled
liability
to
sickness
on
the
way
of
grown
persons
and
the
desire
of
performing
the
trip
in
as
short
a
time
as
possible
induce
us
still
to
think
our
estimate
of
that
item
not
extravagant
whatever
may
be
necessary
in
the
emigration
of
our
people
to
their
comfort
on
the
way
and
as
conducive
to
their
health
we
desire
to
be
afforded
them
at
the
same
time
it
is
our
anxious
wish
in
the
management
of
this
business
to
be
free
at
all
times
from
the
imputation
of
extravagance
they
added
that
the
item
of
soap
had
been
forgotten
in
their
first
estimate
and
must
now
be
included
at
the
rate
of
three
pounds
to
every
hundred
pounds
of
rations
general
scott
replied
as
the
cherokee
people
are
exclusively
interested
in
the
cost
as
well
as
the
comfort
of
the
removal
he
did
not
feel
himself
at
liberty
to
withhold
his
sanction
from
these
estimates
in
the
report
of
the
indian
commissioner
also
it
is
stated
that
the
cost
of
removal
according
to
the
indian
estimate
is
high
but
the
commissioner
adds
as
their
own
fund
pays
it
and
it
was
insisted
on
by
their
own
confidential
agents
it
was
thought
it
could
not
be
rejected
noble
liberality
this
nation
of
eighteen
thousand
industrious
people
compelled
at
the
point
of
the
bayonet
to
leave
their
country
and
seek
new
homes
in
a
wilderness
are
to
be
permitted
as
a
favor
to
spend
on
their
journey
to
this
wilderness
as
much
of
their
own
money
as
they
think
necessary
and
have
all
the
soap
they
want
the
record
which
the
united
states
government
has
left
in
official
papers
of
its
in
the
matter
of
this
cherokee
removal
has
an
element
in
it
of
the
ludicrous
spite
of
the
tragedy
and
shame
says
the
secretary
of
war
the
generous
and
enlightened
policy
evinced
in
the
measures
adopted
by
congress
toward
that
people
during
the
last
session
was
ably
and
judiciously
carried
into
effect
by
the
general
appointed
to
conduct
their
removal
the
reluctance
of
the
indians
to
relinquish
the
land
of
their
birth
in
the
east
and
remove
to
their
new
homes
in
the
west
was
entirely
overcome
by
the
judicious
conduct
of
that
officer
and
they
departed
with
alacrity
under
the
guidance
of
their
own
chiefs
the
arrangements
for
this
purpose
made
by
general
scott
in
compliance
with
his
previous
instructions
although
somewhat
costly
to
the
indians
themselves
met
the
entire
approbation
of
the
department
as
it
was
deemed
of
the
last
importance
that
the
cherokees
should
remove
to
the
west
voluntarily
and
that
upon
their
arrival
at
the
place
of
their
ultimate
destination
they
should
recur
to
the
manner
in
which
they
had
been
treated
with
kind
and
grateful
feelings
humanity
no
less
than
good
policy
dictated
this
course
toward
these
children
of
the
forest
and
in
carrying
out
in
this
instance
with
an
unwavering
hand
the
measures
resolved
upon
by
the
government
in
the
hope
of
preserving
the
indians
and
of
maintaining
the
peace
and
tranquillity
of
the
whites
it
will
always
be
gratifying
to
reflect
that
this
has
been
effected
not
only
without
violence
but
with
every
proper
regard
for
the
feelings
and
interests
of
that
people
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
says
in
his
report
the
case
of
the
cherokees
is
a
striking
example
of
the
liberality
of
the
government
in
all
its
branches
a
retrospect
of
the
last
eight
months
in
reference
to
this
numerous
and
more
than
ordinarily
enlightened
tribe
can
not
fail
to
be
refreshing
to
minds
a
further
appropriation
had
been
asked
by
the
cherokee
chiefs
to
meet
the
expense
of
their
removal
they
not
thinking
a
very
munificent
payment
for
a
country
as
large
as
all
massachusetts
rhode
island
and
connecticut
together
and
congress
had
passed
a
law
giving
them
more
and
the
commissioner
says
of
this
when
it
is
considered
that
by
the
treaty
of
december
the
sum
of
was
stipulated
to
be
paid
them
as
the
full
value
of
their
lands
after
that
amount
was
declared
by
the
senate
of
the
united
states
to
be
an
ample
consideration
for
them
the
spirit
of
this
whole
proceeding
can
not
be
too
much
admired
by
some
the
measure
may
be
regarded
as
just
by
others
generous
it
perhaps
partook
of
both
attributes
if
it
went
farther
than
naked
justice
could
have
demanded
it
did
not
stop
short
of
what
liberality
approved
if
our
acts
have
been
generous
they
have
not
been
less
wise
and
politic
a
large
mass
of
men
have
been
conciliated
the
hazard
of
an
effusion
of
human
blood
has
been
put
by
good
feeling
has
been
preserved
and
we
have
quietly
and
gently
transported
eighteen
thousand
friends
to
the
west
bank
of
the
mississippi
to
dwell
on
the
picture
of
this
removal
is
needless
the
fact
by
itself
is
more
eloquent
than
pages
of
detail
and
description
could
make
it
no
imagination
so
dull
no
heart
so
hard
as
not
to
see
and
to
feel
at
the
bare
mention
of
such
an
emigration
what
horrors
and
what
anguish
it
must
have
involved
eighteen
thousand
friends
only
a
great
magnanimity
of
nature
strengthened
by
true
christian
principle
could
have
prevented
them
from
being
changed
into
eighteen
thousand
bitter
enemies
for
some
years
after
this
removal
fierce
dissensions
rent
the
cherokee
nation
the
party
who
held
that
the
treaty
of
had
been
unfair
and
that
the
nation
still
had
an
unextinguished
right
to
its
old
country
at
the
east
felt
as
was
natural
a
bitter
hatred
toward
the
party
which
they
claimed
had
wrongfully
signed
away
the
nation
lands
several
of
the
signers
of
the
treaty
influential
men
of
the
nation
were
murdered
ran
to
such
a
height
that
the
united
states
government
was
compelled
to
interfere
and
in
after
long
negotiations
and
dissensions
a
new
treaty
was
made
by
the
terms
and
concessions
of
which
the
party
were
appeased
a
general
amnesty
provided
for
and
comparative
harmony
restored
to
the
nation
the
progress
of
this
people
in
the
ten
years
following
this
removal
is
almost
past
belief
in
they
had
primary
schools
and
had
just
built
two
large
houses
for
a
male
and
female
seminary
in
which
the
higher
branches
of
education
were
to
be
taught
they
had
a
temperance
society
with
three
thousand
members
and
an
auxiliary
society
in
each
of
the
eight
districts
into
which
the
country
was
divided
they
had
a
bible
society
and
twelve
churches
a
weekly
newspaper
partly
in
english
partly
in
cherokee
eight
district
courts
two
circuit
courts
and
a
supreme
court
legislative
business
was
transacted
as
before
by
the
national
council
and
committee
elected
for
four
years
nearly
one
thousand
boys
and
girls
were
in
the
public
schools
in
the
agitation
on
the
subject
of
slavery
began
to
be
felt
a
strong
antislavery
party
being
organized
in
the
nation
there
were
stormy
scenes
also
in
that
part
of
the
country
nearest
the
kansas
line
for
several
years
white
settlers
had
persisted
in
taking
up
farms
there
and
the
cherokees
had
in
vain
implored
the
government
to
drive
them
away
the
officer
at
last
sent
to
enforce
the
cherokees
rights
and
dislodge
the
squatters
was
obliged
to
burn
their
cabins
over
their
heads
before
they
would
stir
so
persuaded
were
they
of
the
superior
right
of
the
white
man
over
the
indian
the
only
reason
the
settlers
gave
for
not
heeding
the
notices
was
that
they
had
been
often
notified
before
to
quit
the
reservation
and
no
steps
having
been
taken
to
enforce
obedience
they
supposed
they
would
be
allowed
to
remain
with
like
security
in
this
instance
it
is
surprising
says
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
to
see
the
growing
disposition
on
the
part
of
our
citizens
to
wholly
disregard
our
treaty
obligations
with
indian
tribes
within
our
borders
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
in
future
their
rights
will
be
held
more
sacred
or
that
the
government
will
in
every
instance
promptly
see
that
they
are
observed
and
respected
in
the
first
year
of
the
civil
war
a
large
number
of
the
cherokees
took
up
arms
on
the
rebel
side
that
this
was
not
from
any
love
or
liking
for
the
southern
cause
it
would
seem
must
be
evident
to
any
one
who
believed
that
they
were
possessed
of
memories
the
opportunity
of
fighting
against
georgians
could
not
but
have
been
welcome
to
the
soul
of
a
cherokee
even
if
he
bought
it
at
the
price
of
fighting
on
the
side
of
the
government
which
had
been
so
perfidious
to
his
nation
their
defection
was
no
doubt
largely
due
to
terror
the
forts
in
their
vicinity
were
surrendered
to
the
rebels
all
united
states
troops
were
withdrawn
from
that
part
of
the
country
they
had
no
prospect
of
protection
from
the
government
and
as
if
to
leave
them
without
one
incentive
to
loyalty
the
government
suspended
the
payment
of
their
annuities
the
confederate
government
stepped
in
artfully
promising
to
pay
what
the
northern
government
refused
it
would
have
taken
a
rare
loyalty
indeed
to
have
stood
unmoved
in
such
circumstances
as
these
yet
thousands
of
the
indians
in
indian
territory
did
remain
loyal
and
fled
for
their
lives
to
avoid
being
pressed
into
the
rebel
service
almost
half
of
the
creek
nation
many
seminoles
chickasaws
quapaws
cherokees
and
half
a
dozen
six
thousand
in
to
kansas
where
their
sufferings
in
the
winter
of
were
that
the
cherokees
did
not
lightly
abandon
their
allegiance
is
on
record
in
the
official
history
of
the
department
of
the
interior
the
report
of
the
indian
bureau
for
says
the
cherokees
prior
to
the
rebellion
were
the
most
numerous
intelligent
wealthy
and
influential
tribe
of
this
superintendency
the
southern
for
many
months
they
steadily
resisted
the
efforts
made
by
the
rebels
to
induce
them
to
abandon
their
allegiance
to
the
federal
government
but
being
wholly
unprotected
and
without
the
means
of
resistance
they
were
finally
compelled
to
enter
into
treaty
stipulations
with
the
rebel
authorities
this
connection
was
however
of
short
duration
for
upon
the
first
appearance
of
united
states
forces
in
their
country
an
entire
regiment
of
indian
troops
raised
ostensibly
for
service
in
the
rebel
army
deserted
and
came
over
to
us
and
have
ever
since
been
under
our
command
and
upon
all
occasions
have
proved
themselves
faithful
and
efficient
soldiers
in
the
course
of
the
next
year
however
many
more
joined
the
rebels
it
was
estimated
that
between
six
and
seven
thousand
of
the
wealthier
portion
of
the
nation
in
one
way
or
another
with
the
rebels
the
result
was
that
at
the
end
of
the
war
the
cherokee
country
was
ruined
in
the
cherokee
country
says
the
report
of
the
indian
bureau
for
where
the
contending
armies
have
moved
to
and
fro
where
their
foraging
parties
have
gone
at
will
sparing
neither
friend
nor
foe
where
the
disloyal
cherokees
in
the
service
of
the
rebel
government
were
determined
that
no
trace
of
the
homesteads
of
their
loyal
brethren
should
remain
for
their
return
and
where
the
swindling
have
made
their
gains
for
two
years
past
the
scene
is
one
of
utter
desolation
the
party
feeling
between
the
loyal
and
disloyal
cherokees
ran
as
high
as
it
did
between
the
loyal
and
disloyal
whites
and
it
looked
for
a
time
as
if
it
would
be
as
impossible
to
make
the
two
opposing
parties
in
the
cherokee
nation
agree
to
live
peaceably
side
by
side
with
each
other
as
it
would
to
make
discharged
soldiers
from
georgia
and
from
maine
settle
down
in
one
village
together
but
after
long
and
troublesome
negotiations
a
treaty
was
concluded
in
by
which
all
the
necessary
points
seemed
to
be
established
of
a
general
amnesty
and
peace
that
the
indians
were
at
a
great
disadvantage
in
the
making
of
these
new
treaties
it
is
unnecessary
to
state
the
peculiarity
of
the
view
of
their
situation
and
rights
is
most
näively
stated
in
one
of
the
reports
for
alluding
to
the
necessity
of
making
at
no
very
distant
time
new
treaties
with
all
these
southern
tribes
one
of
the
indian
superintendents
says
while
the
rebelling
of
a
large
portion
of
most
of
these
tribes
abrogates
treaty
obligations
and
places
them
at
our
mercy
the
very
important
fact
should
not
be
forgotten
that
the
government
first
wholly
failed
to
keep
its
treaty
stipulations
with
those
people
and
in
protecting
them
by
withdrawing
all
the
troops
from
the
forts
in
indian
territory
and
leaving
them
at
the
mercy
of
the
rebels
it
is
a
fact
that
in
many
instances
compelled
them
to
make
the
best
terms
they
could
with
the
rebels
nevertheless
they
are
at
our
mercy
because
their
making
the
best
terms
they
could
with
the
rebels
abrogates
treaty
obligations
the
trite
old
proverb
about
the
poorness
of
rules
that
do
not
work
both
ways
seems
to
be
applicable
here
with
a
recuperative
power
far
in
advance
of
that
shown
by
any
of
the
small
white
communities
at
the
south
the
cherokees
at
once
addressed
themselves
to
rebuilding
their
homes
and
reconstructing
their
national
life
in
one
year
they
established
fifteen
new
schools
set
all
their
old
industries
going
and
in
held
a
large
agricultural
fair
which
gave
a
creditable
exhibition
of
stock
and
farm
produce
thus
a
second
time
they
recovered
themselves
after
what
would
seem
to
be
their
destruction
as
a
people
but
the
indian
fate
of
perpetual
insecurity
alarm
and
unrest
does
not
abandon
them
in
they
are
said
to
be
extremely
uneasy
about
the
security
of
their
possession
of
the
lands
they
occupy
when
asked
why
their
are
not
reforms
introduced
into
the
administration
of
justice
desirable
improvements
undertaken
the
reply
inevitably
comes
we
expect
to
have
our
lands
taken
away
what
is
the
use
of
all
that
when
our
doom
as
a
nation
is
sealed
distrust
is
firmly
seated
in
their
minds
national
apathy
depresses
them
and
until
they
realize
a
feeling
of
assurance
that
their
title
to
their
lands
will
be
respected
and
that
treaties
are
an
inviolable
law
for
all
parties
the
cherokees
will
not
make
the
efforts
for
national
progress
of
which
they
are
capable
when
their
delegates
went
to
washington
in
to
make
the
new
treaty
they
were
alarmed
by
the
position
taken
by
the
government
that
the
nation
as
a
nation
had
forfeited
its
rights
they
were
given
to
understand
that
public
opinion
held
them
responsible
for
complicity
in
the
rebellion
and
although
they
could
point
to
the
fact
that
the
only
countenance
the
rebels
received
came
from
less
than
of
the
population
and
cite
the
services
of
two
cherokee
regiments
in
the
union
cause
it
was
urged
home
to
them
that
before
being
rehabilitated
in
their
former
rights
by
a
new
treaty
they
were
not
in
a
position
to
refuse
any
conditions
imposed
such
language
from
persons
they
believed
to
possess
the
power
of
injuring
their
people
intimidated
the
cherokee
delegates
they
sold
a
large
tract
in
kansas
at
a
dollar
an
acre
to
an
association
of
speculators
and
it
went
into
the
possession
of
a
railroad
company
they
also
acceded
against
the
wishes
of
the
cherokee
people
to
a
provision
in
the
treaty
granting
right
of
way
through
the
country
for
two
railroads
this
excited
great
uneasiness
among
the
indians
and
well
it
might
the
events
of
the
next
few
years
amply
justified
this
uneasiness
the
rapacity
of
railroad
corporations
is
as
insatiable
as
their
methods
are
unscrupulous
the
phrase
extinguishing
indian
titles
has
become
as
it
were
a
mere
technical
term
in
the
transfer
of
lands
the
expression
is
so
common
that
it
has
probably
been
one
of
the
agencies
in
fixing
in
the
minds
of
the
people
the
prevalent
impression
that
extinction
is
the
ultimate
and
inevitable
fate
of
the
indian
and
this
being
the
case
methods
and
times
are
not
after
all
of
so
much
consequence
they
are
merely
foreordained
conditions
of
the
great
foreordained
progression
of
events
this
is
the
only
explanation
of
the
unconscious
inhumanity
of
many
good
men
modes
of
thinking
and
speaking
in
regard
to
the
indians
being
driven
from
home
after
home
and
robbed
of
tract
after
tract
of
their
lands
in
the
report
of
the
indian
bureau
for
is
an
account
of
a
remnant
of
the
cherokee
tribe
in
north
carolina
they
number
not
far
from
seventeen
hundred
and
there
are
probably
in
other
parts
of
north
carolina
and
scattered
through
georgia
and
tennessee
between
three
and
four
hundred
more
these
cherokees
have
had
an
eventful
history
when
the
main
portion
of
the
tribe
was
compelled
to
remove
west
of
the
mississippi
they
fled
to
the
mountains
and
have
steadily
refused
to
leave
their
homes
the
proceeds
of
their
lands
which
were
sold
in
accordance
with
a
treaty
with
the
main
body
of
the
cherokees
have
been
mainly
expended
in
the
purchase
of
lands
and
providing
funds
for
the
western
cherokees
at
various
times
previous
to
the
year
the
agent
for
the
eastern
cherokees
at
their
request
purchased
lands
with
their
funds
upon
which
they
might
make
their
homes

purchases
though
probably
made
with
good
intent
carelessly
left
the
title
in
their
agent
personally
and
not
in
trust
by
this
neglect
when
subsequently
the
agent
became
insolvent
all
their
lands
were
seized
and
sold
for
his
debts
by
special
legislation
of
congress
their
case
has
been
brought
before
the
courts
of
north
carolina
and
their
rights
to
a
certain
extent
asserted
and
they
are
enabled
to
maintain
possession
of
their
lands
and
by
the
use
of
their
own
funds
in
extinguishing
liens
are
now
in
possession
of
above
seventy
thousand
acres
of
fair
arable
timber
and
grazing
lands
they
have
shown
themselves
capable
of
and
i
believe
have
demonstrated
the
unwisdom
of
removing
indians
from
a
country
which
offers
to
them
a
home
and
where
a
white
man
could
make
a
living
this
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
they
are
now
though
receiving
scarcely
any
government
aid
in
a
more
hopeful
condition
both
as
to
morals
and
industry
and
personal
property
than
the
cherokees
who
removed
west
the
report
of
the
indian
bureau
for
fully
bears
out
this
statement
the
north
carolina
cherokees
have
indeed
reason
to
be
in
a
more
hopeful
condition
for
they
have
their
lands
secured
to
them
by
patent
confirmed
by
a
decision
of
state
courts
but
this
is
what
the
department
of
the
interior
has
brought
itself
to
say
as
to
the
western
lands
and
those
of
all
other
civilized
tribes
in
the
indian
territory
by
treaty
the
government
has
ceded
to
the
civilized
cherokees
creeks
choctaws
chickasaws
and
section
of
country
altogether
disproportionate
in
amount
to
their
needs
the
amount
susceptible
of
cultivation
must
be
greater
than
can
ever
be
cultivated
by
the
labor
of
the
indians
but
the
indians
claim
it
is
understood
that
they
hold
their
lands
by
sanctions
so
solemn
that
it
would
be
a
gross
breach
of
faith
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
take
away
any
portion
thereof
without
their
consent
and
that
consent
they
apparently
propose
to
withhold
let
us
set
side
by
side
with
this
last
paragraph
a
quotation
from
the
treaty
by
virtue
of
which
the
indians
claim
it
is
understood
that
they
hold
these
lands
which
they
now
apparently
propose
to
withhold
we
will
not
copy
it
from
the
original
treaty
we
will
copy
it
and
a
few
other
sentences
with
it
from
an
earlier
report
of
this
same
department
of
the
interior
only
so
far
back
as
we
find
the
department
in
a
juster
frame
of
mind
toward
the
cherokees
a
large
part
of
the
indian
tribes
hold
lands
to
which
they
are
only
fixed
by
laws
that
define
the
reservations
to
which
they
shall
be
confined
it
can
not
be
denied
that
these
are
in
a
great
measure
dependent
on
the
humanity
of
the
american
people
but
the
cherokees
and
the
other
civilized
indian
nations
no
less
hold
lands
in
perpetuity
by
titles
defined
by
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
the
united
states
agreed
possess
the
cherokees
and
to
guarantee
it
to
them
forever
and
that
guarantee
solemnly
pledged
of
seven
million
acres
of
land
the
consideration
for
this
territory
was
the
same
number
of
acres
elsewhere
located
the
inducement
to
the
bargain
set
forth
in
the
treaty
was
anxious
desire
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
to
secure
to
the
cherokee
nation
of
indians
a
permanent
home
and
which
shall
under
the
most
solemn
guarantee
of
the
united
states
be
and
remain
theirs
home
that
shall
never
in
all
future
time
be
embarrassed
by
having
extended
around
it
the
lines
or
placed
over
it
the
jurisdiction
of
a
territory
or
state
or
be
pressed
upon
by
the
extension
in
any
way
of
the
limits
of
any
existing
state
to
assure
them
of
their
title
a
patent
for
the
territory
was
issued
this
was
the
view
of
the
department
of
the
interior
in
in
the
department
says
that
affairs
in
the
indian
territory
are
complicated
and
embarrassing
and
the
question
is
directly
raised
whether
an
extensive
section
of
country
is
to
be
allowed
to
remain
for
an
indefinite
period
practically
an
uncultivated
waste
or
whether
the
government
shall
determine
to
reduce
the
size
of
the
reservation
the
phrase
whether
the
government
shall
determine
to
reduce
the
size
of
the
reservation
sounds
much
better
than
whether
the
government
shall
rob
the
indians
of
a
few
millions
of
acres
of
land
but
the
latter
phrase
is
truth
and
the
other
is
the
spirit
of
lying
the
commissioner
says
that
the
question
is
a
difficult
one
and
should
be
considered
with
calmness
and
a
full
purpose
to
do
no
injustice
to
the
indians
he
gives
his
own
personal
opinion
on
it
with
hesitancy
but
gives
it
nevertheless
that
public
policy
will
soon
require
the
disposal
of
a
large
portion
of
these
lands
to
the
government
for
the
occupancy
either
of
other
tribes
of
indians
or
of
white
people
there
is
a
very
general
and
growing
opinion
that
observance
of
the
strict
letter
of
treaties
with
indians
is
in
many
cases
at
variance
with
their
own
best
interests
and
with
sound
public
policy
he
adds
however
that
it
must
not
be
understood
from
this
recommendation
that
it
is
the
policy
or
purpose
of
this
office
to
in
any
way
encourage
the
spirit
of
rapacity
which
demands
the
throwing
open
of
the
indian
territory
to
white
settlement
he
says
the
true
way
to
secure
its
perpetual
occupancy
by
indians
is
to
fill
it
up
with
other
indians
to
give
them
lands
in
severalty
and
to
provide
a
government
strong
and
intelligent
enough
to
protect
them
effectually
from
any
and
all
encroachments
on
the
part
of
the
whites
comment
on
these
preposterously
contradictory
sentences
would
be
idle
the
best
comment
on
them
and
the
most
fitting
close
to
this
sketch
of
the
cherokee
nation
is
in
a
few
more
quotations
from
the
official
reports
of
the
indian
bureau
of
this
people
from
whom
the
department
of
the
interior
proposes
for
public
policy
to
take
away
a
large
portion
of
their
country
it
has
published
within
the
last
three
years
these
records
it
has
been
but
a
few
years
since
the
cherokees
assembled
in
council
under
trees
or
in
a
rude
with
hewed
logs
for
seats
now
the
legislature
assembles
in
a
spacious
brick
provided
with
suitable
senate
chamber
representative
hall
library
and
executive
offices
which
cost
their
citizens
occupy
neat
hewed
double
frame
brick
or
stone
houses
according
to
the
means
or
taste
of
the
individual
with
ground
adorned
by
ornamental
trees
shrubbery
flowers
and
nearly
every
improvement
including
orchards
of
the
choicest
fruits
some
of
these
orchards
have
existed
for
nearly
twenty
years
and
are
now
in
a
good
fruitful
condition
their
women
are
usually
good
and
give
great
attention
to
spinning
and
weaving
yarns
jeans
and
linsey
and
make
most
of
the
pants
and
of
the
men
and
boys
the
farmers
raise
most
of
their
own
wool
and
cotton
and
it
is
not
an
uncommon
sight
in
a
cherokee
farmer
house
to
see
a
and
a
piano
they
have
ample
provision
for
the
education
of
all
their
children
to
a
degree
of
advancement
equal
to
that
furnished
by
an
ordinary
college
in
the
states
they
have
common
kept
open
ten
months
in
the
year
in
the
different
settlements
for
the
higher
education
of
their
young
men
and
women
they
have
two
commodious
and
seminaries
one
for
each
sex
and
in
addition
to
those
already
mentioned
they
have
a
manual
labor
school
and
an
orphan
asylum
the
cost
of
maintaining
these
schools
the
past
year
was
as
reported
by
the
superintendent
of
public
instruction
of
which
was
paid
as
salary
to
teachers
they
have
stores
mills
and
owned
and
conducted
by
their
own
citizens
their
constitution
and
laws
are
published
in
book
form
and
from
their
goes
forth
among
the
people
in
their
own

and
also
in
english
the
a
weekly

which
is
edited
with

and

they
have

this
is
true

out
of

are
derived
from

and
by
them

on
national
warrants
issued
by
the
principal

registered
by
the
auditors
they
are
an
intelligent
temperate
and
industrious
people
who
live
by
the
honest
fruits
of
their
labor

seem
ambitious
to
advance

development
of

lands
and

conveniences
of

homes
in
their
council
may
be
found
men
of
learning
and

and
it
is
doubtful
if
their
rapid
progress
from
a
state
of
wild
barbarism
to
that
of
civilization
and
enlightenment
has
any
parallel

chapter
ix
massacres
of
indians
by
whites
conestoga
when
the
english
first
entered
pennsylvania
messengers
from
the
conestoga
indians
met
them
bidding
them
welcome
and
bringing
gifts
of
corn
and
venison
and
skins
the
whole
tribe
entered
into
a
treaty
of
friendship
with
william
penn
which
was
to
last
as
long
as
the
sun
should
shine
or
the
waters
run
into
the
rivers
the
records
of
pennsylvania
history
in
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
contain
frequent
mention
of
the
tribe
in
the
governor
sent
the
secretary
of
his
council
with
a
delegation
of
ten
men
to
hold
an
interview
with
them
at
conestoga
for
purposes
of
mutual
understanding
and
confidence
and
in
that
same
year
thomas
chalkley
a
famous
quaker
preacher
while
sojourning
among
the
maryland
quakers
was
suddenly
seized
with
so
great
a
concern
to
visit
these
indians
that
he
laid
the
matter
before
the
elders
at
the
nottingham
meeting
and
the
idea
being
promoted
by
the
elders
he
set
off
with
an
interpreter
and
a
party
of
fourteen
to
make
the
journey
he
says
we
travelled
through
the
woods
about
fifty
miles
carrying
our
provisions
with
us
and
on
the
journey
sat
down
by
a
river
and
spread
our
food
on
the
grass
and
refreshed
ourselves
and
horses
and
then
went
on
cheerfully
and
with
and
much
love
to
the
poor
indians
and
when
we
came
they
received
us
kindly
treating
us
civilly
in
their
way
we
treated
about
having
a
meeting
with
them
in
a
religious
way
upon
which
they
called
a
council
in
which
they
were
very
grave
and
spoke
one
after
another
without
any
heat
or
jarring
some
of
the
most
esteemed
of
their
women
speak
in
their
councils
when
asked
why
they
suffered
the
women
to
speak
they
replied
that
some
women
were
wiser
than
some
men
it
was
said
that
they
had
not
for
many
years
done
anything
without
the
advice
of
a
certain
aged
and
grave
woman
who
was
always
present
at
their
councils
the
interpreter
said
that
she
was
an
empress
and
that
they
gave
much
heed
to
what
she
said
this
wise
queen
of
conestoga
looked
with
great
favor
on
the
quakers
the
interpreter
said
because
they
did
not
come
to
buy
or
sell
or
get
gain
but
came
in
love
and
respect
to
them
and
desired
their
both
here
and
hereafter
two
nations
at
this
time
were
represented
in
this
conestoga
senecas
and
the
shawanese
the
next
year
the
governor
himself
anxious
to
preserve
their
inalienable
and
to
prevent
their
being
seduced
by
emissaries
from
the
french
went
himself
to
visit
them
on
this
occasion
one
of
the
chiefs
made
a
speech
still
preserved
in
the
old
records
which
contains
this
passage
father
we
love
quiet
we
suffer
the
mouse
to
play
when
the
woods
are
rustled
by
the
wind
we
fear
not
when
the
leaves
are
disturbed
in
ambush
we
are
uneasy
when
a
cloud
obscures
your
brilliant
sun
our
eyes
feel
dim
but
when
the
rays
appear
they
give
great
heat
to
the
body
and
joy
to
the
heart
treachery
darkens
the
chain
of
friendship
but
truth
makes
it
brighter
than
ever
this
is
the
peace
we
desire
a
few
years
later
a
swedish
missionary
visited
them
and
preached
them
a
sermon
on
original
sin
and
the
necessity
of
a
mediator
when
he
had
finished
an
indian
chief
rose
and
replied
to
him
both
discourses
being
given
through
an
interpreter
the
swede
is
said
to
have
been
so
impressed
with
the
indian
reasoning
that
after
returning
to
sweden
he
wrote
out
his
own
sermon
and
the
indian
reply
in
the
best
latin
at
his
command
and
dedicated
the
documents
to
the
university
of
upsal
respectfully
requesting
them
to
furnish
him
with
some
arguments
strong
enough
to
confute
the
strong
reasonings
of
this
savage
our
forefathers
said
the
chief
were
under
a
strong
persuasion
as
we
are
that
those
who
act
well
in
this
life
will
be
rewarded
in
the
next
according
to
the
degrees
of
their
virtues
and
on
the
other
hand
that
those
who
behave
wickedly
here
will
undergo
such
punishments
hereafter
as
were
proportionate
to
the
crimes
they
were
guilty
of
this
has
been
constantly
and
invariably
received
and
acknowledged
for
a
truth
through
every
successive
generation
of
our
ancestors
it
could
not
then
have
taken
its
rise
from
fable
for
human
fiction
however
artfully
and
plausibly
contrived
can
never
gain
credit
long
among
people
where
free
inquiry
is
allowed
which
was
never
denied
by
our
ancestors
now
we
desire
to
propose
some
questions
does
he
believe
that
our
forefathers
men
eminent
for
their
piety
constant
and
warm
in
their
pursuit
of
virtue
hoping
thereby
to
merit
eternal
happiness
were
all
damned
does
he
think
that
we
who
are
zealous
imitators
in
good
works
and
influenced
by
the
same
motives
as
we
are
earnestly
endeavoring
with
the
greatest
circumspection
to
tread
the
path
of
integrity
are
in
a
state
of
damnation
if
that
be
his
sentiment
it
is
surely
as
impious
as
it
is
bold
and
daring
let
us
suppose
that
some
heinous
crimes
were
committed
by
some
of
our
ancestors
like
to
that
we
are
told
of
another
race
of
people
in
such
a
case
god
would
certainly
punish
the
criminal
but
would
never
involve
us
that
are
innocent
in
the
guilt
those
who
think
otherwise
must
make
the
almighty
a
very
whimsical
being
once
more
are
the
christians
more
virtuous
or
rather
are
they
not
more
vicious
than
we
are
if
so
how
came
it
to
pass
that
they
are
the
objects
of
god
beneficence
while
we
are
neglected
does
he
daily
confer
his
favors
without
reason
and
with
so
much
partiality
in
a
word
we
find
the
christians
much
more
depraved
in
their
morals
than
we
are
and
we
judge
from
their
doctrine
by
the
badness
of
their
lives
it
is
plain
that
this
indian
chief
speech
was
very
much
latinized
in
the
good
swede
hands
but
if
the
words
even
approached
being
a
true
presentation
of
what
he
said
it
is
wonderful
indeed
in
his
excellency
sir
william
keith
governor
of
the
province
of
pennsylvania
went
with
an
escort
of
eighty
horsemen
to
conestoga
and
spent
several
days
in
making
a
treaty
with
the
representatives
of
the
five
nations
the
indians
of
conestoga
and
their
friends
he
was
entertained
at
captain
civility
cabin
when
he
left
them
he
desired
them
to
give
his
very
kind
love
and
the
love
of
all
our
people
to
your
kings
and
to
all
their
people
he
invited
them
to
visit
him
in
philadelphia
saying
we
can
provide
better
for
you
and
make
you
more
welcome
people
always
receive
their
friends
best
at
their
own
homes
he
then
took
out
a
coronation
medal
of
the
king
and
presented
it
to
the
indian
in
these
words
that
our
children
when
we
are
dead
may
not
forget
these
things
but
keep
this
treaty
between
us
in
perpetual
remembrance
i
here
deliver
to
you
a
picture
in
gold
bearing
the
image
of
my
great
master
the
king
of
all
the
english
and
when
you
return
home
i
charge
you
to
deliver
this
piece
into
the
hands
of
the
first
man
or
greatest
chief
of
all
the
five
nations
whom
you
call
kannygoodk
to
be
laid
up
and
kept
as
a
token
to
our
children
children
that
an
entire
and
lasting
friendship
is
now
established
forever
between
the
english
in
this
country
and
the
great
five
nations
at
this
time
the
village
of
conestoga
was
described
as
lying
about
seventy
miles
west
of
philadelphia
the
land
thereabout
being
exceeding
rich
it
is
now
surrounded
with
divers
fine
plantations
and
farms
where
they
raise
quantities
of
wheat
barley
flax
and
hemp
without
the
help
of
any
dung
the
next
year
also
was
marked
by
a
council
of
great
significance
at
conestoga
in
the
spring
of
this
year
an
indian
called
saanteenee
had
been
killed
by
two
white
men
brothers
named
cartledge
at
this
time
it
was
not
only
politic
but
necessary
for
the
english
to
keep
on
good
terms
with
as
many
indians
as
possible
therefore
the
old
record
says
policy
and
justice
required
a
rigid
inquiry
into
this
affair
and
the
infliction
of
exemplary
punishment
accordingly
the
cartledges
were
arrested
and
confined
in
philadelphia
and
the
of
chester
county
went
with
two
influential
men
of
the
province
to
conestoga
to
confer
with
the
indians
as
to
what
should
be
done
with
them
the
indians
were
unwilling
to
decide
the
matter
without
advice
from
the
five
nations
to
whom
they
owed
allegiance
a
swift
runner
satcheecho
was
therefore
sent
northward
with
the
news
of
the
occurrence
and
the
governor
with
two
of
his
council
went
to
albany
to
hear
what
the
five
nations
had
to
say
about
it
what
an
inconceivable
spectacle
to
us
the
governments
of
pennsylvania
and
new
york
so
fully
recognizing
an
indian
to
be
a
person
and
his
murder
a
thing
to
be
anxiously
and
swiftly
atoned
for
if
possible
only
a
little
more
than
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
lie
between
this
murder
of
saanteenee
in
conestoga
and
the
murder
of
big
snake
on
the
ponca
reservation
in
verily
policy
has
kept
a
large
assortment
of
spectacles
for
justice
to
look
through
in
a
surprising
short
space
of
time
on
the
decision
of
the
king
and
chiefs
of
the
five
nations
hung
the
fate
of
the
murderers
doubtless
the
brothers
cartledge
made
up
their
minds
to
die
the
known
principles
of
the
indians
in
the
matter
of
avenging
injuries
certainly
left
them
little
room
for
hope
but
no
the
five
nations
took
a
different
view
they
desired
that
the
cartledges
should
not
suffer
death
and
the
affair
was
at
length
amicably
settled
says
the
old
record
one
life
said
the
indian
king
on
this
occasion
is
enough
to
be
lost
there
should
not
two
die
this
was
in
in
there
were
only
twenty
of
these
conestoga
indians
men
five
women
and
eight
children
they
were
still
living
in
their
village
on
the
shawanee
creek
their
lands
being
assured
to
them
by
manorial
gift
but
they
were
miserably
by
making
brooms
baskets
and
wooden
bowls
a
part
of
their
living
and
begged
the
rest
they
were
wholly
peaceable
and
unoffending
friendly
to
their
white
neighbors
and
pitifully
clinging
and
affectionate
naming
their
children
after
whites
who
were
kind
to
them
and
striving
in
every
way
to
show
their
gratitude
and
upon
this
little
community
a
band
of
white
men
said
by
some
of
the
old
records
to
be
presbyterians
from
paxton
made
an
attack
at
daybreak
on
the
of
december
they
found
only
six
of
the
indians
at
men
two
women
and
a
boy
the
rest
were
away
either
at
work
for
the
white
farmers
or
selling
their
little
wares
these
poor
defenceless
creatures
were
immediately
fired
upon
stabbed
and
hatcheted
to
death
the
good
shebaes
among
the
rest
cut
to
pieces
in
his
bed
all
of
them
were
scalped
and
otherwise
horribly
mangled
then
their
huts
were
set
on
fire
and
most
of
them
burnt
down
shebaes
was
a
very
old
man
having
assisted
at
the
second
treaty
held
with
penn
in
and
ever
since
continued
a
faithful
friend
to
the
english
he
is
said
to
have
been
an
exceeding
good
man
considering
his
education
being
naturally
of
a
most
kind
benevolent
temper
from
a
manuscript
journal
kept
at
this
time
and
belonging
to
the
of
robert
barber
the
first
settler
in
lancaster
county
are
gathered
the
few
details
known
of
this
massacre
some
of
the
murderers
went
directly
from
the
scene
of
their
crime
to
barber
house
they
were
strangers
to
him
but
with
the
hospitality
of
those
days
he
made
a
fire
for
them
and
set
refreshments
before
them
while
they
warmed
themselves
they
inquired
why
the
indians
were
suffered
to
live
peaceably
here
barber
said
they
were
entirely
inoffensive
living
on
their
own
lands
and
injuring
no
one
they
asked
what
would
be
the
consequence
if
they
were
all
destroyed
barber
said
he
thought
they
would
be
as
liable
to
punishment
as
if
they
had
destroyed
so
many
white
men
they
said
were
of
a
different
opinion
and
in
a
few
minutes
went
out
in
the
mean
time
two
sons
of
barber
about
ten
or
twelve
years
old
went
out
to
look
at
the
strangers
horses
which
were
hitched
at
a
little
distance
from
the
house
after
the
men
went
the
boys
came
in
and
said
that
they
had
tomahawks
tied
to
their
saddles
which
were
all
bloody
and
that
they
had
gun
christy
was
a
little
indian
boy
about
their
own
age
they
were
much
attached
to
him
as
he
was
their
playmate
and
made
bows
and
arrows
for
them
while
the
family
were
talking
over
this
and
wondering
what
it
could
mean
a
messenger
came
running
breathless
to
inform
them
of
what
had
happened
barber
went
at
once
to
the
spot
and
there
he
found
the
murdered
indians
lying
in
the
smouldering
ruins
of
their
homes
like
logs
he
with
some
trouble
procured
their
bodies
to
administer
to
them
the
rights
of
sepulture
it
was
said
that
at
the
beginning
of
the
slaughter
an
indian
mother
placed
her
little
child
under
a
barrel
charging
it
to
make
no
noise
and
that
a
shot
was
fired
through
the
barrel
which
broke
the
arm
and
still
it
kept
silent
the
magistrates
of
lancaster
shocked
as
well
they
might
be
at
this
frightful
barbarity
sent
messengers
out
immediately
and
took
the
remaining
indians
wherever
they
were
found
brought
them
into
the
town
for
protection
and
lodged
them
in
the
workhouse
or
jail
which
was
the
strongest
building
in
the
place
the
governor
of
pennsylvania
issued
a
proclamation
ordering
all
judges
sheriffs
and
all
his
majesty
liege
subjects
in
the
province
to
make
every
effort
to
apprehend
the
authors
and
perpetrators
of
this
crime
also
their
abettors
and
accomplices
but
the
paxton
boys
held
magistrates
and
governor
alike
in
derision
two
weeks
later
they
assembled
again
fifty
strong
rode
to
lancaster
dismounted
broke
open
the
doors
of
the
jail
and
killed
every
indian
there
when
the
poor
wretches
saw
they
had
no
protection
nigh
nor
could
possibly
escape
and
being
without
the
least
weapon
of
defence
they
divided
their
little
families
the
children
clinging
to
their
parents
they
fell
on
their
faces
protested
their
innocence
declared
their
love
to
the
english
and
that
in
their
whole
lives
they
had
never
done
them
injury
and
in
this
posture
they
all
received
the
hatchet
men
women
and
children
were
every
one
inhumanly
murdered
in
cold
blood
the
barbarous
men
who
committed
the
atrocious
act
in
defiance
of
government
of
all
laws
human
and
divine
and
to
the
eternal
disgrace
of
their
country
and
color
then
mounted
their
horses
huzzaed
in
triumph
as
if
they
had
gained
a
victory
and
rode
off
unmolested
the
bodies
of
the
murdered
were
then
brought
out
and
exposed
in
the
street
till
a
hole
could
be
made
in
the
earth
to
receive
and
cover
them
but
the
wickedness
can
not
be
covered
and
the
guilt
will
lie
on
the
whole
land
till
justice
is
done
on
the
murderers
the
blood
of
the
innocent
will
cry
to
heaven
for
vengeance
these
last
extracts
are
from
a
pamphlet
printed
in
philadelphia
at
the
time
of
the
massacre
printed
anonymously
because
so
much
had
fear
seized
the
minds
of
the
people
that
neither
the
writer
nor
the
printer
dared
to
give
name
or
place
of
abode
there
are
also
private
letters
still
preserved
which
give
accounts
of
the
affair
a
part
of
one
from
william
henry
of
lancaster
to
a
friend
in
philadelphia
is
given
in
rupp
history
of
lancaster
county
he
says
a
regiment
of
highlanders
were
at
that
time
quartered
at
the
barracks
in
the
town
and
yet
these
murderers
were
permitted
to
break
open
the
doors
of
the
city
jail
and
commit
the
horrid
deed
the
first
notice
i
had
of
the
affair
was
that
while
at
my
father
store
near
the
i
saw
a
number
of
people
running
toward
the
jail
which
enticed
me
and
other
lads
to
follow
them
at
about
six
or
eight
yards
from
the
jail
we
met
from
to
thirty
men
well
mounted
on
horses
and
with
rifles
tomahawks
and
equipped
for
murder
i
ran
into
the
and
there
oh
what
a
horrid
sight
presented
itself
to
my
view
near
the
back
door
of
the
prison
lay
an
old
indian
and
his
squaw
particularly
well
known
and
esteemed
by
the
people
of
the
town
on
account
of
his
placid
and
friendly
conduct
his
name
was
will
soc
around
him
and
his
squaw
lay
two
children
about
the
age
of
three
years
whose
heads
were
split
with
the
tomahawk
and
their
scalps
taken
off
toward
the
middle
of
the
along
the
west
side
of
the
wall
lay
a
stout
indian
whom
i
particularly
noticed
to
have
been
shot
in
his
breast
his
legs
were
chopped
with
the
tomahawk
his
hands
cut
off
and
finally
a
discharged
in
his
mouth
so
that
his
head
was
blown
to
atoms
and
the
brains
were
splashed
against
and
yet
hanging
to
the
wall
for
three
or
four
feet
around
this
man
hands
and
feet
had
been
chopped
off
with
a
tomahawk
in
this
manner
lay
the
whole
of
women
and
about
the
shot
scalped
hacked
and
cut
to
pieces
after
this
the
governor
of
pennsylvania
issued
a
second
proclamation
still
more
stringent
than
the
first
and
offering
a
reward
of
for
the
apprehension
of
any
three
of
the
ringleaders
but
the
paxton
boys
were
now
like
wild
beasts
that
had
tasted
blood
they
threatened
to
attack
the
quakers
and
all
persons
who
sympathized
with
or
protected
indians
they
openly
mocked
and
derided
the
governor
and
his
proclamations
and
set
off
at
once
for
philadelphia
announcing
their
intention
of
killing
all
the
moravian
indians
who
had
been
placed
under
the
protection
of
the
military
there
their
march
through
the
country
was
like
that
of
a
band
of
maniacs
in
a
private
letter
written
by
david
rittenhouse
at
this
time
he
says
about
fifty
of
these
scoundrels
marched
by
my
workshop
i
have
seen
hundreds
of
indians
travelling
the
country
and
can
with
truth
affirm
that
the
behavior
of
these
fellows
was
ten
times
more
savage
and
brutal
than
theirs
frightening
women
by
running
the
muzzles
of
guns
through
windows
hallooing
and
swearing
attacking
men
without
the
least
provocation
dragging
them
by
the
hair
to
the
ground
and
pretending
to
scalp
them
shooting
dogs
and
fowls
these
are
some
of
their
exploits
it
is
almost
past
belief
that
at
this
time
many
people
justified
these
acts
an
episcopalian
clergyman
in
lancaster
wrote
vindicating
them
bringing
scripture
to
prove
that
it
was
right
to
destroy
the
heathen
and
the
presbyterians
think
they
have
a
better
less
than
the
word
of
god
says
one
of
the
writers
on
the
massacre
with
the
scriptures
in
their
hands
and
mouths
they
can
set
at
naught
that
express
command
shalt
do
no
murder
and
justify
their
wickedness
by
the
command
given
to
joshua
to
destroy
the
heathen
horrid
perversion
of
scripture
and
religion
to
father
the
worst
of
crimes
on
the
god
of
love
and
peace
it
is
a
trite
saying
that
history
repeats
itself
but
it
is
impossible
to
read
now
these
accounts
of
the
massacres
of
defenceless
and
peaceable
indians
in
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
without
the
reflection
that
the
record
of
the
nineteenth
is
blackened
by
the
same
stains
what
pennsylvania
pioneers
did
in
to
helpless
and
peaceable
indians
of
conestoga
colorado
pioneers
did
in
to
helpless
and
peaceable
cheyennes
at
sand
creek
and
have
threatened
to
do
again
to
helpless
and
peaceable
utes
in
the
word
extermination
is
as
ready
on
the
frontiersman
tongue
as
it
was
a
hundred
years
ago
and
the
threat
is
more
portentous
now
seeing
that
we
are
by
a
whole
century
of
prosperity
stronger
and
more
numerous
and
the
indians
are
by
a
whole
century
of
suffering
and
oppression
fewer
and
weaker
but
our
crime
is
baser
and
our
infamy
deeper
in
the
same
proportion
close
upon
this
conestoga
massacre
followed
a
removal
of
friendly
earliest
on
record
and
one
whose
cruelty
and
cost
to
the
suffering
indians
well
entitle
it
to
a
place
in
a
narrative
of
massacres
everywhere
in
the
provinces
fanatics
began
to
renew
the
old
cry
that
the
indians
were
the
canaanites
whom
god
had
commanded
joshua
to
destroy
and
that
these
wars
were
a
token
of
god
displeasure
with
the
europeans
for
permitting
the
heathen
to
live
soon
it
became
dangerous
for
a
moravian
indian
to
be
seen
anywhere
in
vain
did
he
carry
one
of
the
pennsylvania
governor
passports
in
his
pocket
he
was
liable
to
be
shot
at
sight
with
no
time
to
pull
his
passport
out
even
in
the
villages
there
was
no
safety
the
devoted
congregations
watched
and
listened
night
and
day
not
knowing
at
what
hour
they
might
hear
the
fatal
warwhoop
of
hostile
members
of
their
own
race
coming
to
slay
them
or
the
sudden
shots
of
white
settlers
coming
to
avenge
on
them
outrages
committed
by
savages
hundreds
of
miles
away
with
every
report
that
arrived
of
indian
massacres
at
the
north
the
fury
of
the
white
people
all
over
the
country
rose
to
greater
height
including
even
christian
indians
in
its
unreasoning
hatred
but
in
the
pious
language
of
a
narrative
written
by
one
of
the
moravian
missionaries
god
inclined
the
hearts
of
the
chief
magistrates
to
protect
them
november
an
express
arrived
from
philadelphia
bringing
an
order
that
all
the
baptized
indians
from
nain
and
wechquetank
should
be
brought
to
philadelphia
and
be
protected
in
that
city
having
first
delivered
up
their
arms
two
days
later
both
these
congregations
set
out
on
their
sad
journey
weeping
as
they
left
their
homes
they
joined
forces
at
bethlehem
on
the
banks
of
the
lecha
and
entered
upon
their
pilgrimage
in
the
name
of
the
lord
the
congregation
of
bethlehem
standing
spectators
and
as
they
passed
commending
them
to
the
grace
and
protection
of
god
with
supplication
and
tears
four
of
the
moravian
missionaries
were
with
them
and
some
of
the
brethren
from
bethlehem
accompanied
them
all
the
way
the
sheriff
jennings
caring
for
them
as
a
father
the
aged
the
sick
and
the
little
children
were
carried
in
wagons
all
the
others
women
and
men
went
on
foot
the
november
rains
had
made
the
roads
very
heavy
as
the
weary
and
people
toiled
slowly
along
through
the
mud
they
were
saluted
with
curses
and
abuse
on
all
sides
as
they
passed
through
the
streets
of
germantown
a
mob
gathered
and
followed
them
taunting
them
with
violent
threats
of
burning
hanging
and
other
tortures
it
was
said
that
a
party
had
been
organized
to
make
a
serious
attack
on
them
but
was
deterred
by
the
darkness
and
the
storm
four
days
were
consumed
in
this
tedious
march
and
on
the
of
november
they
reached
philadelphia
here
spite
of
the
governor
positive
order
the
officers
in
command
at
the
barracks
refused
to
allow
them
to
enter
from
ten
in
the
forenoon
till
three
in
the
afternoon
there
the
helpless
creatures
stood
before
the
shut
going
back
and
forth
between
the
defiant
garrison
and
the
bewildered
and
impotent
governor
the
mob
thickening
and
growing
more
and
more
riotous
hour
by
hour
pressing
the
indians
on
every
side
jeering
them
reviling
them
charging
them
with
all
manner
of
outrages
and
threatening
to
kill
them
on
the
spot
the
missionaries
bravely
standing
beside
their
flock
in
vain
tried
to
stem
or
turn
the
torrent
of
insult
and
abuse
all
that
they
accomplished
was
to
draw
down
the
same
insult
and
abuse
on
their
own
heads
nothing
but
the
indians
marvellous
patience
and
silence
saved
them
from
being
murdered
by
this
exasperated
mob
to
the
worst
insults
they
made
no
reply
no
attempt
at
retaliation
or
defence
they
afterward
said
that
they
had
comforted
themselves
by
considering
what
insult
and
mockery
our
saviour
had
suffered
on
their
account
at
last
after
five
hours
of
this
the
governor
unable
to
compel
the
garrison
to
open
the
barracks
sent
an
order
that
the
indians
should
be
taken
to
province
island
an
island
in
the
delaware
river
joined
to
the
by
a
dam
six
miles
more
every
mile
in
risk
of
their
lives
the
poor
creatures
walked
as
they
passed
again
through
the
city
thousands
followed
them
the
old
record
says
and
with
such
tumultuous
clamor
that
they
might
truly
be
considered
as
sheep
among
wolves
long
after
dark
they
reached
the
island
and
were
lodged
in
some
unused
buildings
large
and
comfortless
there
they
kept
their
vesper
service
and
took
heart
from
the
fact
that
the
verse
for
the
day
was
that
verse
of
the
beautiful
psalm
which
has
comforted
so
many
perplexed
souls
i
will
teach
thee
in
the
way
thou
shalt
go
here
they
settled
themselves
as
best
they
could
the
missionaries
had
their
usual
meetings
with
them
and
humane
people
from
philadelphia
especially
some
of
the
people
called
quakers
sent
them
provisions
and
fuel
and
tried
in
various
ways
to
render
the
inconvenience
of
their
situation
less
grievous
before
they
had
been
here
a
month
some
of
the
villages
they
had
left
were
burnt
and
the
riotous
paxton
mob
which
had
murdered
all
the
peaceful
conestoga
indians
announced
its
intention
of
marching
on
province
island
and
killing
every
indian
there
the
governor
of
pennsylvania
launched
proclamation
after
proclamation
forbidding
any
one
under
severest
penalties
to
molest
the
indians
under
its
protection
and
offering
a
reward
of
two
hundred
pounds
for
the
apprehension
of
the
ringleaders
of
the
insurgents
but
public
sentiment
was
inflamed
to
such
a
degree
that
the
government
was
practically
powerless
the
known
ringleaders
and
their
sympathizers
paraded
contemptuously
in
front
of
the
governor
house
mocking
him
derisively
and
not
even
two
hundred
pounds
would
tempt
any
man
to
attack
them
in
many
parts
of
lancaster
county
parties
were
organized
with
the
avowed
intention
of
marching
on
philadelphia
and
slaughtering
all
the
indians
under
the
protection
of
the
government
late
on
the
of
december
rumors
reached
philadelphia
that
a
large
party
of
these
rioters
were
on
the
road
and
the
governor
at
daybreak
the
next
day
sent
large
boats
to
province
island
with
orders
to
the
missionaries
to
put
their
people
on
board
as
quickly
as
possible
row
to
leek
island
and
await
further
orders
in
confusion
and
terror
the
congregations
obeyed
and
fled
to
leek
island
later
in
the
day
came
a
second
letter
from
the
governor
telling
them
that
the
alarm
had
proved
a
false
one
they
might
return
to
province
island
where
he
would
send
them
a
guard
and
that
they
would
better
keep
the
boats
to
be
ready
in
case
of
a
similar
emergency
they
immediately
returned
with
joy
to
their
former
habitation
says
the
old
record
comforted
by
the
text
for
the
lord
is
my
strength
and
my
shield
my
heart
trusted
in
him
ps
closed
this
remarkable
year
with
prayer
and
thanksgiving
for
all
the
proofs
of
the
help
of
god
in
so
many
heavy
trials
four
days
later
the
missionaries
received
a
second
order
for
instant
departure
the
reports
of
the
murderous
intentions
of
the
rioters
being
confirmed
and
the
governor
seeing
only
too
clearly
his
own
powerlessness
to
contend
with
them
he
had
resolved
to
send
the
indians
northward
and
put
them
under
the
protection
of
the
english
army
and
especially
of
sir
william
johnson
agent
for
the
crown
among
the
northern
indians
no
time
was
to
be
lost
in
carrying
out
this
plan
for
at
any
moment
the
mob
might
attack
province
island
accordingly
at
midnight
of
january
the
fugitives
set
out
once
more
passed
through
philadelphia
undiscovered
to
the
of
the
moravian
brethren
where
a
breakfast
had
been
provided
for
them
here
they
were
met
by
the
commissary
fox
who
had
been
detailed
by
the
governor
to
take
charge
of
their
journey
fox
at
their
suffering
appearance
immediately
sent
out
and
bought
blankets
to
be
distributed
among
them
as
some
protection
against
the
cold
wagons
were
brought
for
the
aged
sick
blind
little
children
and
the
heavy
baggage
and
again
the
pitiful
procession
took
up
its
march
again
an
angry
mob
gathered
fast
on
its
steps
cursing
and
reviling
in
a
terrible
manner
only
restrained
by
fear
from
laying
violent
hands
on
them
except
for
the
protection
of
a
military
escort
they
would
scarcely
have
escaped
murderous
assault
at
amboy
two
sloops
lay
ready
to
transport
them
to
new
york
but
just
as
they
reached
this
place
and
were
preparing
to
go
on
shore
a
messenger
arrived
from
the
governor
of
new
york
with
angry
orders
that
not
an
indian
should
set
foot
in
that
territory
even
the
were
forbidden
under
heavy
penalties
to
ferry
one
across
the
river
the
commissioner
in
charge
of
them
in
great
perplexity
sent
to
the
governor
of
pennsylvania
for
further
orders
placing
the
indians
meantime
in
the
amboy
barracks
here
they
held
their
daily
meetings
singing
and
praying
with
great
unction
until
finally
many
of
their
enemies
were
won
to
a
hearty
respect
and
sympathy
for
them
even
soldiers
being
heard
to
say
would
to
god
all
the
white
people
were
as
good
christians
as
these
indians
the
pennsylvania
governor
had
nothing
left
him
to
do
but
to
order
the
indians
back
again
and
accordingly
says
the
record
the
indian
congregation
set
out
with
cheerfulness
on
their
return
in
full
confidence
that
the
lord
in
his
good
providence
for
wise
purposes
best
known
to
himself
had
ordained
their
travelling
thus
to
and
fro
this
belief
supported
them
under
all
the
difficulties
they
met
with
in
their
journeys
made
in
the
severest
part
of
winter
they
made
the
return
journey
under
a
large
military
escort
one
party
in
advance
and
one
bringing
up
the
rear
this
escort
was
composed
of
soldiers
who
having
just
come
from
niagara
where
they
had
been
engaged
in
many
fights
with
the
savages
were
at
first
disposed
to
treat
these
defenceless
indians
with
brutal
cruelty
but
they
were
soon
disarmed
by
the
indians
gentle
patience
and
became
cordial
and
friendly
the
return
journey
was
a
hard
one
the
aged
and
infirm
people
had
become
much
weakened
by
their
repeated
hardships
and
the
little
children
suffered
pitiably
in
crossing
some
of
the
frozen
rivers
the
feeble
ones
were
obliged
to
crawl
on
their
hands
and
feet
on
the
ice
on
the
of
january
they
reached
philadelphia
and
were
at
once
taken
to
the
barracks
where
almost
immediately
mobs
began
again
to
molest
and
threaten
them
the
governor
thoroughly
in
earnest
now
and
determined
to
sustain
his
own
honor
and
that
of
the
province
had
eight
heavy
pieces
of
cannon
mounted
and
a
rampart
thrown
up
in
front
of
the
barracks
the
citizens
were
called
to
arms
and
so
great
was
the
excitement
that
it
is
said
even
quakers
took
guns
and
hurried
to
the
barracks
to
defend
the
indians
and
the
governor
himself
went
at
midnight
to
visit
them
and
reassure
them
by
promises
of
protection
on
february
news
was
received
that
the
rioters
in
large
force
were
approaching
the
city
hearing
of
the
preparations
made
to
receive
them
they
did
not
venture
to
enter
on
the
night
of
the
however
they
drew
near
again
the
whole
city
was
roused
rung
bonfires
lighted
cannon
fired
the
inhabitants
waked
from
their
sleep
and
ordered
to
the
where
arms
were
given
to
all
four
more
cannon
were
mounted
at
the
barracks
and
all
that
day
was
spent
in
hourly
expectation
of
the
rebels
but
their
brave
boasts
were
not
followed
up
by
action
seeing
that
the
city
was
in
arms
against
them
they
halted
the
governor
then
sent
a
delegation
of
citizens
to
ask
them
what
they
wanted
they
asserted
insolently
that
there
were
among
the
indians
some
who
had
committed
murders
and
that
they
must
be
given
up
some
of
the
ringleaders
were
then
taken
into
the
barracks
and
asked
to
point
out
the
murderers
covered
with
confusion
they
were
obliged
to
admit
they
could
not
accuse
one
indian
there
they
then
charged
the
quakers
with
having
taken
away
six
and
concealed
them
this
also
was
disproved
and
finally
the
excitement
subsided
all
through
the
spring
and
summer
the
indians
remained
prisoners
in
the
barracks
their
situation
became
almost
insupportable
from
confinement
unwholesome
diet
and
the
mental
depression
inevitable
in
their
state
to
add
to
their
misery
broke
out
among
them
and
died
in
the
course
of
the
summer
from
this
loathsome
disease
we
can
not
describe
said
the
missionaries
the
joy
and
fervent
desire
which
most
of
them
showed
in
the
prospect
of
seeing
their
saviour
face
to
face
we
saw
with
amazement
the
power
of
the
blood
of
jesus
in
the
hearts
of
poor
sinners
this
was
no
doubt
true
but
there
might
well
have
entered
into
the
poor
dying
creatures
thoughts
an
ecstasy
at
the
mere
prospect
of
freedom
after
a
year
of
such
imprisonment
and
suffering
at
last
on
december
the
news
of
peace
reached
philadelphia
on
the
a
proclamation
was
published
in
all
the
newspapers
that
war
was
ended
and
hostilities
must
cease
the
joy
with
which
the
prisoned
indians
received
this
news
can
hardly
be
conceived
it
exceeded
all
descriptions
says
the
record
and
was
manifested
in
thanksgivings
and
praises
to
the
lord
it
was
still
unsafe
however
for
them
to
return
to
their
old
homes
which
were
thickly
surrounded
by
white
settlers
who
were
no
less
hostile
now
at
heart
than
they
had
been
before
the
proclamation
of
peace
it
was
decided
therefore
that
they
should
make
a
new
settlement
in
the
indian
country
on
the
susquehanna
river
after
a
touching
farewell
to
their
old
friends
of
the
bethlehem
congregation
and
a
grateful
of
the
governor
who
had
protected
and
supported
them
for
sixteen
months
they
set
out
on
the
of
april
for
their
new
home
in
the
wilderness
for
the
third
time
their
aged
sick
and
little
children
were
placed
in
overloaded
wagons
for
a
long
and
difficult
far
harder
one
than
any
they
had
yet
taken
the
inhospitalities
of
the
lonely
wilderness
were
worse
than
the
curses
and
revilings
of
riotous
mobs
they
were
overtaken
by
severe
they
camped
in
icy
swamps
shivering
all
night
around
smouldering
fires
of
wet
wood
to
avoid
still
hostile
whites
they
had
to
take
great
circuits
through
unbroken
forests
where
each
foot
of
their
path
had
to
be
cut
tree
by
tree
the
men
waded
streams
and
made
rafts
for
the
women
and
children
sometimes
when
the
streams
were
deep
they
had
to
go
into
camp
and
wait
till
canoes
could
be
built
they
carried
heavy
loads
of
goods
for
which
there
was
no
room
in
the
wagons
going
over
high
steep
hills
they
often
had
to
divide
their
loads
into
small
parcels
thus
doubling
and
trebling
the
road
their
provisions
gave
out
they
ate
the
bitter
wild
potatoes
when
the
children
cried
with
hunger
they
peeled
and
gave
them
the
inner
bark
to
suck
often
they
had
no
water
except
that
from
shallow
muddy
puddles
once
they
were
environed
by
blazing
woods
whose
fires
burnt
fiercely
for
hours
around
their
encampment
several
of
the
party
died
and
were
buried
by
the
way
but
all
these
trials
were
forgotten
in
their
daily
meetings
in
which
the
presence
of
the
lord
was
most
sensibly
and
comfortably
felt
these
were
always
held
in
the
evening
around
a
large
fire
in
the
open
air
they
celebrated
a
joyful
commemoration
of
easter
and
spent
the
in
blessed
contemplation
of
the
sufferings
of
jesus
whose
presence
supported
them
under
all
afflictions
insomuch
that
they
never
lost
their
cheerfulness
and
resignation
during
the
five
long
weeks
of
this
terrible
journey
on
the
of
may
they
arrived
at
machwihilusing
and
forgot
all
their
pain
and
trouble
for
joy
that
they
had
reached
the
place
of
their
future
abode
with
offers
of
praise
and
thanksgiving
they
devoted
themselves
anew
to
him
who
had
given
them
rest
for
the
soles
of
their
feet
with
renewed
courage
they
selected
their
home
on
the
banks
of
the
susquehanna
and
proceeded
to
build
houses
they
gave
to
the
settlement
the
name
of
name
full
of
significance
as
coming
from
the
hearts
of
these
persecuted
wanderers
tents
of
peace
if
all
this
persecution
had
fallen
upon
these
indians
because
they
were
christians
the
record
piteous
as
it
is
would
be
only
one
out
of
thousands
of
records
of
the
sufferings
of
christian
martyrs
and
would
stir
our
sympathies
less
than
many
another
but
this
was
not
the
case
it
was
simply
because
they
were
indians
that
the
people
demanded
their
lives
and
would
have
taken
them
again
and
again
except
that
all
the
power
of
the
government
was
enlisted
for
their
protection
the
fact
of
their
being
christians
did
not
enter
in
one
way
or
the
other
any
more
than
did
the
fact
that
they
were
peaceable
they
were
indians
and
the
frontiersmen
of
pennsylvania
intended
either
to
drive
all
indians
out
of
their
state
or
kill
them
just
as
the
frontiersmen
of
nebraska
and
of
colorado
now
intend
to
do
if
they
can
we
shall
see
whether
the
united
states
government
is
as
strong
as
the
government
of
the
province
of
pennsylvania
was
in
or
whether
it
will
try
first
and
fail
as
john
penn
did
to
push
the
helpless
hunted
creatures
off
somewhere
into
a
temporary
makeshift
of
shelter
for
a
temporary
deferring
of
the
trouble
of
protecting
them
sixteen
years
after
the
conestoga
massacre
came
that
of
gnadenhütten
the
blackest
crime
on
the
long
list
a
massacre
whose
equal
for
treachery
and
cruelty
can
not
be
pointed
out
in
the
record
of
massacres
of
whites
by
indians
gnadenhütten
in
the
year
the
congregations
of
moravian
indians
living
at
gnadenhütten
salem
and
schonbrun
on
the
muskingum
river
were
compelled
by
hostile
indians
to
forsake
their
villages
and
go
northward
to
the
sandusky
river
this
movement
was
instigated
by
the
english
who
had
become
suspicious
that
the
influence
of
the
moravian
missionaries
was
thrown
on
the
side
of
the
colonies
and
that
their
villages
were
safe
centres
of
information
and
supplies
these
indians
having
taken
no
part
whatever
in
the
war
there
was
no
pretext
for
open
interference
with
them
but
the
english
agents
found
it
no
difficult
matter
to
stir
up
the
hostile
tribes
to
carry
out
their
designs
and
when
the
harassed
congregations
finally
consented
to
move
the
savages
who
escorted
them
were
commanded
by
english
officers
the
savages
drove
them
forward
like
cattle
says
an
old
narrative
the
white
brethren
and
sisters
in
the
midst
surrounded
by
the
believing
indians
one
morning
when
the
latter
could
not
set
out
as
expeditiously
as
the
savages
thought
proper
they
attacked
the
white
brethren
and
forced
them
to
set
out
alone
whipping
their
horses
forward
till
they
grew
wild
and
not
even
allowing
mothers
time
to
suckle
their
children
the
road
was
exceeding
bad
leading
through
a
continuance
of
swamps
sister
zeisberger
fell
twice
from
her
horse
and
once
hanging
in
the
stirrup
was
dragged
for
some
time
but
assistance
was
soon
at
hand
and
the
lord
preserved
her
from
harm
some
of
the
believing
indians
followed
them
as
fast
as
possible
but
with
all
their
exertions
did
not
overtake
them
till
night
for
one
month
these
unfortunate
people
journeyed
through
the
wilds
in
this
way
when
they
reached
the
sandusky
creek
the
savages
left
them
to
take
care
of
themselves
as
best
they
might
they
were
over
a
hundred
miles
from
their
homes
in
a
wilderness
where
there
was
neither
game
nor
provisions
here
they
built
huts
of
logs
and
bark
they
had
neither
beds
nor
blankets
in
fact
the
only
things
which
the
savages
had
left
them
were
their
utensils
for
making
maple
sugar
it
was
the
middle
of
october
when
they
reached
sandusky
already
it
was
cold
and
the
winter
was
drawing
near
in
november
governor
de
peyster
the
english
commander
at
fort
detroit
summoned
the
missionaries
to
appear
before
him
and
refute
the
accusations
brought
against
their
congregations
of
having
aided
and
abetted
the
colonies
the
missionaries
answered
that
they
doubted
not
in
the
least
but
that
very
evil
reports
must
have
reached
his
ears
as
the
treatment
they
had
met
with
had
sufficiently
proved
that
they
were
considered
as
guilty
persons
but
that
these
reports
were
false
that
congress
indeed
knew
that
they
were
employed
as
missionaries
to
the
indians
and
did
not
disturb
them
in
their
labors
but
had
never
in
anything
given
them
directions
how
to
proceed
the
governor
convinced
of
the
innocence
and
of
these
noble
men
publicly
declared
that
he
felt
great
satisfaction
in
their
endeavors
to
civilize
and
christianize
the
indians
and
would
permit
them
to
return
to
their
congregations
he
then
gave
them
passports
for
their
journey
back
to
sandusky
and
appended
a
permission
that
they
should
perform
the
functions
of
their
office
among
the
christian
indians
without
molestation
this
left
them
at
rest
so
far
as
apprehensions
of
attack
from
hostile
indians
were
concerned
but
there
still
remained
the
terrible
apprehension
of
death
by
starvation
and
cold
deep
snows
lay
on
the
ground
their
huts
were
so
small
that
it
was
impossible
to
make
large
fires
in
them
their
floors
being
only
the
bare
earth
whenever
a
thaw
came
the
water
forced
itself
up
and
then
froze
again
cattle
died
for
lack
of
food
and
their
carcasses
were
greedily
devoured
nursing
children
died
for
want
of
nourishment
from
their
starving
mothers
breasts
the
daily
allowance
of
corn
to
each
adult
was
one
pint
and
even
this
pittance
it
was
found
would
not
last
till
spring
nevertheless
they
celebrated
the
christmas
holidays
with
cheerfulness
and
blessing
and
concluded
this
remarkable
year
with
thanks
and
praise
to
him
who
is
ever
the
saviour
of
his
people
but
having
neither
bread
nor
wine
they
could
not
keep
the
communion
meantime
the
corn
still
stood
ungathered
in
their
old
fields
on
the
muskingum
river
frozen
as
it
was
it
would
be
still
a
priceless
store
to
these
starving
people
the
project
of
going
back
there
after
it
began
to
be
discussed
it
was
one
hundred
and
miles
journey
but
food
in
abundance
lay
at
the
journey
end
finally
it
was
decided
that
the
attempt
should
be
made
their
first
plan
was
to
hide
their
families
in
the
woods
at
some
distance
from
the
settlements
lest
there
might
be
some
danger
from
hostile
whites
on
their
way
however
they
were
met
by
some
of
their
brethren
from
schonbrun
who
advised
them
to
go
back
openly
into
their
deserted
towns
assuring
them
that
the
americans
were
friendly
to
them
now
they
accordingly
did
so
and
remained
for
several
weeks
at
salem
and
gnadenhütten
working
day
and
night
gathering
and
husking
the
corn
and
burying
it
in
holes
in
the
ground
in
the
woods
for
future
supply
on
the
very
day
that
they
were
to
have
set
off
with
their
packs
of
corn
to
return
to
their
starving
friends
and
relatives
at
sandusky
a
party
of
between
one
and
two
hundred
whites
made
their
appearance
at
gnadenhütten
seeing
the
indians
scattered
all
through
the
cornfields
they
rode
up
to
them
expressing
pleasure
at
seeing
them
and
saying
that
they
would
take
them
into
pennsylvania
to
a
place
where
they
would
be
out
of
all
reach
of
persecution
from
the
hostile
savages
or
the
english
they
represented
themselves
as
friends
and
brothers
who
had
purposely
come
out
to
relieve
them
from
the
distress
brought
on
them
on
account
of
their
being
friends
to
the
american
people
the
christian
indians
not
in
the
least
doubting
their
sincerity
walked
up
to
them
and
thanked
them
for
being
so
kind
while
the
whites
again
gave
assurances
that
they
would
meet
with
good
treatment
from
them
they
then
advised
them
to
discontinue
their
work
and
cross
over
to
the
town
in
order
to
make
necessary
arrangements
for
the
journey
as
they
intended
to
take
them
out
of
the
reach
of
their
enemies
and
where
they
would
be
supplied
abundantly
with
all
they
stood
in
need
of
they
proposed
to
take
them
to
pittsburg
where
they
would
be
out
of
the
way
of
any
assault
made
by
the
english
or
the
savages
this
the
indians
heard
one
of
their
missionaries
writes
with
resignation
concluding
that
god
would
perhaps
choose
this
method
to
put
an
end
to
their
sufferings
prepossessed
with
this
idea
they
cheerfully
delivered
their
guns
hatchets
and
other
weapons
to
the
murderers
who
promised
to
take
good
care
of
them
and
in
pittsburg
to
return
every
article
to
its
rightful
owner
our
indians
even
showed
them
all
those
things
which
they
had
secreted
in
the
woods
assisted
in
packing
them
up
and
emptied
all
their
beehives
for
these
pretended
friends
in
the
mean
time
one
of
the
assistants
john
martin
by
name
went
to
salem
ten
miles
distant
and
carried
the
good
news
that
a
party
of
whites
had
come
from
the
settlements
to
carry
them
to
a
place
of
safety
and
give
them
protection
the
salem
indians
says
the
same
narrative
did
not
hesitate
to
accept
of
this
proposal
believing
unanimously
that
god
had
sent
the
americans
to
release
them
from
their
disagreeable
situation
at
sandusky
and
imagining
that
when
arrived
at
pittsburg
they
might
soon
find
a
safe
place
to
build
a
settlement
and
easily
procure
advice
and
assistance
from
bethlehem
some
of
the
whites
expressed
a
desire
to
see
the
village
of
salem
were
conducted
thither
and
received
with
much
friendship
by
the
indians
on
the
way
they
entered
into
spiritual
conversation
with
their
unsuspecting
companions
feigning
great
piety
and
discoursing
on
many
religious
and
scriptural
subjects
they
offered
also
to
assist
the
salem
indians
in
moving
their
effects
in
the
mean
time
the
defenceless
indians
at
gnadenhütten
were
suddenly
attacked
driven
together
bound
with
ropes
and
confined
as
soon
as
the
salem
indians
arrived
they
met
with
the
same
fate
the
murderers
then
held
a
council
to
decide
what
should
be
done
with
them
by
a
majority
of
votes
it
was
decided
to
kill
them
all
the
next
day
to
the
credit
of
humanity
be
it
recorded
that
there
were
in
this
band
a
few
who
remonstrated
declared
that
these
indians
were
innocent
and
harmless
and
should
be
set
at
liberty
or
at
least
given
up
to
the
government
as
prisoners
their
remonstrances
were
unavailing
and
finding
that
they
could
not
prevail
on
these
monsters
to
spare
the
indians
lives
they
wrung
their
hands
calling
god
to
witness
that
they
were
innocent
of
the
blood
of
these
christian
indians
they
then
withdrew
to
some
distance
from
the
scene
of
slaughter
the
majority
were
unmoved
and
only
disagreed
as
to
the
method
of
putting
their
victims
to
death
some
were
for
burning
them
alive
others
for
tomahawking
and
scalping
them
the
latter
method
was
determined
on
and
a
message
was
sent
to
the
indians
that
as
they
were
christian
indians
they
might
prepare
themselves
in
a
christian
manner
for
they
must
all
die
the
rest
of
the
narrative
is
best
told
in
the
words
of
the
moravian
missionaries
it
may
be
easily
conceived
how
great
their
terror
was
at
hearing
a
sentence
so
unexpected
however
they
soon
recollected
themselves
and
patiently
suffered
the
murderers
to
lead
them
into
two
houses
in
one
of
which
the
brethren
were
confined
and
in
the
other
the
sisters
and
children
finding
that
all
entreaties
to
save
their
lives
were
to
no
purpose
and
that
some
more
than
others
were
anxious
to
begin
upon
them
they
united
in
begging
a
short
delay
that
they
might
prepare
themselves
for
death
which
request
was
granted
them
then
asking
pardon
for
whatever
offence
they
had
given
or
grief
they
had
occasioned
to
each
other
they
knelt
down
offering
fervent
prayers
to
god
their
saviour
and
kissing
one
another
under
a
flood
of
tears
fully
resigned
to
his
will
they
sung
praises
unto
him
in
the
joyful
hope
that
they
would
soon
be
relieved
from
all
pains
and
join
their
redeemer
in
everlasting
bliss
the
murderers
impatient
to
make
a
beginning
came
again
to
them
while
they
were
singing
and
inquiring
whether
they
were
now
ready
for
dying
they
were
answered
in
the
affirmative
adding
that
they
had
commended
their
immortal
souls
to
god
who
had
given
them
the
assurance
in
their
hearts
that
he
would
receive
their
souls
one
of
the
party
now
taking
up
a
cooper
mallet
which
lay
in
the
house
saying
exactly
this
will
answer
for
the
purpose
began
with
abraham
and
continued
knocking
down
one
after
another
until
he
counted
fourteen
that
he
had
killed
with
his
own
hands
he
now
handed
the
instrument
to
one
of
his
saying
arm
fails
me
go
on
in
the
same
way
i
think
i
have
done
pretty
well
in
another
house
where
mostly
women
and
children
were
confined
judith
a
remarkably
pious
aged
widow
was
the
first
victim
after
they
had
finished
the
horrid
deed
they
retreated
to
a
small
distance
from
the
slaughterhouses
but
after
a
while
returning
again
to
view
the
dead
bodies
and
finding
one
of
them
abel
although
scalped
and
mangled
attempting
to
raise
himself
from
the
floor
they
so
renewed
their
blows
upon
him
that
he
never
rose
again
thus
persons
magnified
the
name
of
the
lord
by
patiently
meeting
a
cruel
death
were
grown
persons
and
children
many
of
them
were
born
of
christian
parents
in
the
society
and
were
among
those
who
in
the
year
were
taken
under
the
protection
of
the
pennsylvania
government
at
the
time
of
the
riots
of
the
paxton
boys
two
boys
about
fourteen
years
of
age
almost
miraculously
escaped
from
this
massacre
one
of
them
was
scalped
and
thrown
down
for
dead
recovering
himself
he
looked
around
but
with
great
presence
of
mind
lay
down
again
quickly
feigning
death
in
a
few
moments
he
saw
the
murderers
return
and
again
bury
their
hatchets
in
the
head
of
abel
who
was
attempting
to
rise
though
scalped
and
terribly
mangled
as
soon
as
it
was
dark
thomas
crept
over
the
dead
bodies
and
escaped
to
the
woods
where
he
hid
himself
till
night
the
other
lad
who
was
confined
in
the
house
with
the
women
contrived
unnoticed
to
slip
through
a
into
the
cellar
where
he
lay
concealed
through
the
day
the
blood
all
the
while
running
down
through
the
floor
in
streams
at
dark
he
escaped
through
a
small
window
and
crept
to
the
woods
where
he
encountered
thomas
and
the
two
made
their
way
together
after
incredible
hardships
to
sandusky
to
describe
the
grief
and
terror
of
the
indian
congregation
on
hearing
that
so
large
a
number
of
its
members
was
so
cruelly
massacred
is
impossible
parents
wept
and
mourned
for
the
loss
of
their
children
husbands
for
their
wives
and
wives
for
their
husbands
children
for
their
parents
sisters
for
brothers
and
brothers
for
sisters
but
they
murmured
not
nor
did
they
call
for
vengeance
on
the
murderers
but
prayed
for
them
and
their
greatest
consolation
was
a
full
assurance
that
all
their
beloved
relatives
were
now
at
home
in
the
presence
of
the
lord
and
in
full
possession
of
everlasting
happiness
an
account
of
this
massacre
was
given
in
the
of
april
it
runs
as
follows
the
people
being
greatly
alarmed
and
having
received
intelligence
that
the
indian
towns
on
the
muskingum
had
not
moved
as
reported
a
number
of
men
properly
provided
collected
and
rendezvoused
on
the
ohio
opposite
the
mingo
bottom
with
a
desire
to
surprise
the
above
towns
one
hundred
men
swam
the
river
and
proceeded
to
the
towns
on
the
muskingum
where
the
indians
had
collected
a
large
quantity
of
provisions
to
supply
their
they
arrived
at
the
town
in
the
night
undiscovered
attacked
the
indians
in
their
cabins
and
so
completely
surprised
them
that
they
killed
and
scalped
upward
of
a
few
making
their
forty
of
whom
were
warriors
the
rest
old
women
and
children
about
eighty
horses
fell
into
their
hands
which
they
loaded
with
the
plunder
the
greatest
part
furs
and
skins
and
returned
to
the
ohio
without
the
loss
of
a
man
of
in
less
than
one
hundred
years
from
this
gnadenhütten
massacre
an
officer
of
the
united
states
army
stationed
at
camp
grant
in
arizona
territory
writes
to
his
commanding
officer
the
following
letter
camp
grant
arizona
territory
may
dear
colonel
for
your
kind
letter
of
last
week
if
i
could
see
you
and
have
a
long
talk
and
answer
all
your
questions
i
could
come
nearer
giving
you
a
clear
idea
of
the
history
of
the
indians
at
this
post
than
by
any
written
account
having
had
them
constantly
under
my
observation
for
nearly
three
months
and
the
care
of
them
constantly
on
my
mind
certain
things
have
become
so
much
a
matter
of
certainty
to
me
that
i
am
liable
to
forget
the
amount
of
evidence
necessary
to
convince
even
the
most
unprejudiced
mind
that
has
not
been
brought
in
contact
with
them
i
will
however
try
and
give
you
a
connected
account
and
if
it
proves
not
sufficiently
full
in
detail
you
may
be
sure
all
its
positive
statements
will
be
sustained
by
the
testimony
of
all
competent
judges
who
have
been
at
this
post
and
cognizant
of
the
facts
sometime
in
february
a
party
of
five
old
women
came
in
under
a
flag
of
truce
with
a
letter
from
colonel
greene
saying
they
were
in
search
of
a
boy
the
son
of
one
of
the
number
taken
prisoner
near
salt
river
some
months
before
this
boy
had
been
well
cared
for
and
had
become
attached
to
his
new
mode
of
life
and
did
not
wish
to
return
the
party
were
kindly
treated
rationed
while
here
and
after
two
days
went
away
asking
permission
to
return
they
came
in
about
eight
days
i
think
with
a
still
larger
number
with
some
articles
for
sale
to
purchase
manta
as
they
were
nearly
naked
before
going
away
they
said
a
young
chief
would
like
to
come
in
with
a
party
and
have
a
talk
this
i
encouraged
and
in
a
few
days
he
came
with
about
of
his
band
he
stated
in
brief
that
he
was
chief
of
a
band
of
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
of
what
were
originally
the
aravapa
apaches
that
he
wanted
peace
that
he
and
his
people
had
no
home
and
could
make
none
as
they
were
at
all
times
apprehensive
of
the
approach
of
the
cavalry
i
told
him
he
should
go
to
the
white
mountains
he
said
is
not
our
country
neither
are
they
our
people
we
are
at
peace
with
them
but
never
have
mixed
with
them
our
fathers
and
their
fathers
before
them
have
lived
in
these
mountains
and
have
raised
corn
in
this
valley
we
are
taught
to
make
mescal
our
principal
article
of
food
and
in
summer
and
winter
here
we
have
a
supply
at
the
white
mountains
there
is
none
and
without
it
now
we
get
sick
some
of
our
people
have
been
in
at
goodwin
and
for
a
short
time
at
the
white
mountains
but
they
are
not
contented
and
they
all
say
let
us
go
to
the
aravapa
and
make
a
final
peace
and
never
break
it
i
told
him
i
had
no
authority
to
make
any
treaty
with
him
or
to
promise
him
that
he
would
be
allowed
a
permanent
home
here
but
that
he
could
bring
in
his
hand
and
i
would
feed
them
and
report
his
wishes
to
the
department
commander
in
the
mean
time
runners
had
been
in
from
two
other
small
bands
asking
the
same
privileges
and
giving
the
same
reasons
i
made
the
same
reply
to
all
and
by
about
the
of
march
i
had
over
three
hundred
here
i
wrote
a
detailed
account
of
the
whole
matter
and
sent
it
by
express
to
department
asking
for
instructions
having
only
the
general
policy
of
the
government
in
such
cases
for
my
guidance
after
waiting
more
than
six
weeks
my
letter
was
returned
to
me
without
comment
except
calling
my
attention
to
the
fact
that
it
was
not
briefed
properly
at
first
i
put
them
in
camp
about
half
a
mile
from
the
post
and
counted
them
and
issued
their
rations
every
second
day
the
number
steadily
increased
until
it
reached
the
number
of
five
hundred
and
ten
knowing
as
i
did
that
the
responsibility
of
the
whole
movement
rested
with
me
and
that
in
case
of
any
loss
to
the
government
coming
of
it
i
should
be
the
sufferer
i
kept
them
continually
under
my
observation
till
i
came
not
only
to
know
the
faces
of
the
men
but
of
the
women
and
children
they
were
nearly
naked
and
needed
everything
in
the
way
of
clothing
i
stopped
the
indians
from
bringing
hay
that
i
might
buy
of
these
i
arranged
a
system
of
tickets
with
which
to
pay
them
and
encourage
them
and
to
be
sure
that
they
were
properly
treated
i
personally
attended
to
the
weighing
i
also
made
inquiries
as
to
the
kind
of
goods
sold
them
and
prices
this
proved
a
perfect
success
not
only
the
women
and
children
engaged
in
the
work
but
the
men
the
amount
furnished
by
them
in
about
two
months
was
nearly
pounds
during
this
time
many
small
parties
had
been
out
with
passes
for
a
certain
number
of
days
to
burn
mescal
these
parties
were
always
mostly
women
and
i
made
myself
sure
by
noting
the
size
of
the
party
and
from
the
amount
of
mescal
brought
in
that
no
treachery
was
intended
from
the
first
i
was
determined
to
know
not
only
all
they
did
but
their
hopes
and
intentions
for
this
purpose
i
spent
hours
each
day
with
them
in
explaining
to
them
the
relations
they
should
sustain
to
the
government
and
their
prospects
for
the
future
in
case
of
either
obedience
or
disobedience
i
got
from
them
in
return
much
of
their
habits
of
thought
and
rules
of
action
i
made
it
a
point
to
tell
them
all
they
wished
to
know
and
in
the
plainest
and
most
positive
manner
they
were
readily
obedient
and
remarkably
quick
of
comprehension
they
were
happy
and
contented
and
took
every
opportunity
to
show
it
they
had
sent
out
runners
to
two
other
bands
which
were
connected
with
them
by
intermarriages
and
had
received
promises
from
them
that
they
would
come
in
and
join
them
i
am
confident
from
all
i
have
been
able
to
learn
that
but
for
this
butchery
by
this
time
we
would
have
had
one
thousand
persons
and
at
least
two
hundred
and
fifty
men
as
their
number
increased
and
the
weather
grew
warmer
they
asked
and
obtained
permission
to
move
farther
up
the
aravapa
to
higher
ground
and
plenty
of
water
and
opposite
to
the
ground
they
were
proposing
to
plant
they
were
rationed
every
third
day
captain
stanwood
arrived
about
the
first
of
april
and
took
command
of
the
post
he
had
received
while
verbal
instructions
from
general
stoneman
to
recognize
and
feed
any
indians
he
might
find
at
the
post
as
prisoners
of
war
after
he
had
carefully
inspected
all
things
pertaining
to
their
conduct
and
treatment
he
concluded
to
make
no
changes
but
had
become
so
well
satisfied
of
the
integrity
of
their
intentions
that
he
left
on
the
with
his
whole
troop
for
a
long
scout
in
the
lower
part
of
the
territory
the
ranchmen
in
this
vicinity
were
friendly
and
kind
to
them
and
felt
perfectly
secure
and
had
agreed
with
me
to
employ
them
at
a
fair
rate
of
pay
to
harvest
their
barley
the
indians
seemed
to
have
lost
their
characteristic
anxiety
to
purchase
ammunition
and
had
in
many
instances
sold
their
best
bows
and
arrows
i
made
frequent
visits
to
their
camp
and
if
any
were
absent
from
count
made
it
my
business
to
know
why
such
was
the
condition
of
things
up
to
the
morning
of
the
of
april
they
had
so
won
on
me
that
from
my
first
idea
of
treating
them
justly
and
honestly
as
an
officer
of
the
army
i
had
come
to
feel
a
strong
personal
interest
in
helping
to
show
them
the
way
to
a
higher
civilization
i
had
come
to
feel
respect
for
men
who
ignorant
and
naked
were
still
ashamed
to
lie
or
steal
and
for
women
who
would
work
cheerfully
like
slaves
to
clothe
themselves
and
children
but
untaught
held
their
virtue
above
price
aware
of
the
lies
industriously
circulated
by
the
puerile
press
of
the
country
i
was
content
to
know
i
had
positive
proof
they
were
so
i
had
ceased
to
have
any
fears
of
their
leaving
here
and
only
dreaded
for
them
that
they
might
be
at
any
time
ordered
to
do
so
they
frequently
expressed
anxiety
to
hear
from
the
general
that
they
might
have
confidence
to
build
for
themselves
better
houses
but
would
always
say
know
what
we
want
and
if
you
ca
see
him
you
can
write
and
do
for
us
what
you
can
it
is
possible
that
during
this
time
individuals
from
here
had
visited
other
bands
but
that
any
number
had
ever
been
out
to
assist
in
any
marauding
expedition
i
know
is
false
on
the
morning
of
april
i
was
at
breakfast
at
when
a
despatch
was
brought
to
me
by
a
sergeant
of
company
p
infantry
from
captain
penn
commanding
camp
lowell
informing
me
that
a
large
party
had
left
tucson
on
the
with
the
avowed
purpose
of
killing
all
the
indians
at
this
post
i
immediately
sent
the
two
interpreters
mounted
to
the
indian
camp
with
orders
to
tell
the
chiefs
the
exact
state
of
things
and
for
them
to
bring
their
entire
party
inside
the
post
as
i
had
no
cavalry
and
but
about
fifty
infantry
all
recruits
and
no
other
officer
i
could
not
leave
the
post
to
go
to
their
defence
my
messengers
returned
in
about
an
hour
with
intelligence
that
they
could
find
no
living
indians
their
camp
was
burning
and
the
ground
strewed
with
their
dead
and
mutilated
women
and
children
i
immediately
mounted
a
party
of
about
twenty
soldiers
and
citizens
and
sent
them
with
the
post
surgeon
with
a
wagon
to
bring
in
the
wounded
if
any
could
be
found
the
party
returned
late
in
the
afternoon
having
found
no
wounded
and
without
having
been
able
to
communicate
with
any
of
the
survivors
early
the
next
morning
i
took
a
similar
party
with
spades
and
shovels
and
went
out
and
buried
the
dead
immediately
in
and
about
the
camp
i
had
the
day
before
offered
the
interpreters
or
any
one
who
would
do
so
to
go
to
the
mountains
and
communicate
with
them
and
convince
them
that
no
officer
or
soldier
of
the
united
states
government
had
been
concerned
in
the
vile
transaction
and
failing
in
this
i
thought
the
act
of
caring
for
their
dead
would
be
an
evidence
to
them
of
our
sympathy
at
least
and
the
conjecture
proved
correct
for
while
we
were
at
the
work
many
of
them
came
to
the
spot
and
indulged
in
expressions
of
grief
too
wild
and
terrible
to
be
described
that
evening
they
began
to
come
in
from
all
directions
singly
and
in
small
parties
so
changed
as
hardly
to
be
recognizable
in
the
hours
during
which
they
had
neither
eaten
nor
slept
many
of
the
men
whose
families
had
all
been
killed
when
i
spoke
to
them
and
expressed
sympathy
for
them
were
obliged
to
turn
away
unable
to
speak
and
too
proud
to
show
their
grief
the
women
whose
children
had
been
killed
or
stolen
were
convulsed
with
grief
and
looked
to
me
appealingly
as
if
i
were
their
last
hope
on
earth
children
who
two
days
before
had
been
full
of
frolic
kept
at
a
distance
expressing
wondering
horror
i
did
what
i
could
i
fed
them
talked
to
them
and
listened
patiently
to
their
accounts
i
sent
horses
to
the
mountains
to
bring
in
two
badly
wounded
women
one
shot
through
the
left
leg
one
with
an
arm
shattered
these
were
attended
to
and
are
doing
well
and
will
recover
their
camp
was
surrounded
and
attacked
at
daybreak
so
sudden
and
unexpected
was
it
that
i
found
a
number
of
women
shot
while
asleep
beside
their
bundles
of
hay
which
they
had
collected
to
bring
in
on
that
morning
the
wounded
who
were
unable
to
get
away
had
their
brains
beaten
out
with
clubs
or
stones
while
some
were
shot
full
of
arrows
after
having
been
mortally
wounded
by
the
bodies
were
all
stripped
of
the
number
buried
one
was
an
old
man
and
one
was
a
boy
all
the
rest
women
and
children
of
the
whole
number
killed
and
one
hundred
and
eight
were
men
it
has
been
said
that
the
men
were
not
there
they
were
all
there
on
the
we
counted
one
hundred
and
men
a
small
number
being
absent
for
mescal
all
of
whom
have
since
been
in
i
have
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
with
them
since
the
affair
and
have
been
astonished
at
their
continued
unshaken
faith
in
me
and
their
perfectly
clear
understanding
of
their
misfortune
they
say
know
there
are
a
great
many
white
men
and
mexicans
who
do
not
wish
us
to
live
at
peace
we
know
that
the
papagos
would
never
have
come
out
against
us
at
this
time
unless
they
had
been
persuaded
to
do
so
what
they
do
not
understand
is
while
they
are
at
peace
and
are
conscious
of
no
wrong
intent
that
they
should
be
murdered
one
of
the
chiefs
said
no
longer
want
to
live
my
women
and
children
have
been
killed
before
my
face
and
i
have
been
unable
to
defend
them
most
indians
in
my
place
would
take
a
knife
and
cut
their
throats
but
i
will
live
to
show
these
people
that
all
they
have
done
and
all
they
can
do
shall
not
make
me
break
faith
with
you
so
long
as
you
will
stand
by
us
and
defend
us
in
a
language
we
know
nothing
of
to
a
great
governor
we
never
have
and
never
shall
see
about
their
captives
they
say
them
back
for
us
our
little
boys
will
grow
up
slaves
and
our
girls
as
soon
as
they
are
large
enough
will
be
diseased
prostitutes
to
get
money
for
whoever
owns
them
our
women
work
hard
and
are
good
women
and
they
and
our
children
have
no
diseases
our
dead
you
can
not
bring
to
life
but
those
that
are
living
we
gave
to
you
and
we
look
to
you
who
can
write
and
talk
and
have
soldiers
to
get
them
back
i
assure
you
it
is
no
easy
task
to
convince
them
of
my
zeal
when
they
see
so
little
being
done
i
have
pledged
my
word
to
them
that
i
never
would
rest
day
or
night
until
they
should
have
justice
and
just
now
i
would
as
soon
leave
the
army
as
to
be
ordered
away
from
them
or
be
obliged
to
order
them
away
from
here
but
you
well
know
the
difficulties
in
the
way
you
know
that
parties
who
would
engage
in
murder
like
this
could
and
would
make
statements
and
multiply
affidavits
without
end
in
their
justification
i
know
you
will
use
your
influence
on
the
right
side
i
believe
with
them
this
may
be
made
either
a
means
of
making
good
citizens
of
them
and
their
children
or
of
driving
them
out
to
a
hopeless
war
of
extermination
they
ask
to
be
allowed
to
live
here
in
their
old
homes
where
nature
supplies
nearly
all
their
wants
they
ask
for
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
of
their
faith
and
they
ask
that
all
their
captive
children
may
be
returned
to
them
is
their
demand
unreasonable
this
letter
was
written
to

it
is
published
in
the
report
of
the
board

commissioners
for
there
is

to
it
the
following
affidavit
of
the
post

at

of

surgeon
at
camp
grant
arizona
where
i
arrived
april
and
reported
to
the
commanding
officer
for
duty
as
medical
officer
some
four
hundred
apache
indians
were
at
that
time
held
as
prisoners
of
war
by
the
military
stationed
at
camp
grant
and
during
the
period
intervening
between
april
and
i
saw
the
indians
every
day
they
seemed
very
well
contented
and
were
busily
employed
in
bringing
in
hay
which
they
sold
for
manta
and
such
little
articles
as
they
desired
outside
the
government
ration
april
chiquita
and
some
of
the
other
chiefs
were
at
the
post
and
asked
for
seeds
and
for
some
hoes
stating
that
they
had
ground
cleared
and
ready
for
planting
they
were
told
that
the
had
been
sent
for
and
would
be
up
from
tucson
in
a
few
days
they
then
left
and
i
saw
nothing
more
of
them
until
after
the
killing
morning
i
heard
a
rumor
that
the
indians
had
been
attacked
and
learned
from
lieutenant
whitman
that
he
had
sent
the
two
interpreters
to
the
indian
camp
to
warn
the
indians
and
bring
them
down
where
they
could
be
protected
if
possible
the
interpreters
returned
and
stated
that
the
attack
had
already
been
made
and
the
indians
dispersed
and
that
the
attacking
party
were
returning
whitman
then
ordered
me
to
go
to
the
indian
camp
to
render
medical
assistance
and
bring
down
any
wounded
i
might
find
i
took
twelve
men
and
a
wagon
and
proceeded
without
delay
to
the
scene
of
the
murder
on
my
arrival
i
found
that
i
should
have
but
little
use
for
the
wagon
or
medicine
the
work
had
been
too
thoroughly
done
the
camp
had
been
fired
and
the
dead
bodies
of
women
and
children
were
lying
scattered
over
the
ground
those
who
had
been
wounded
in
the
first
instance
had
their
brains
beaten
out
with
stones
two
of
the
squaws
had
been
first
ravished
and
then
shot
dead
one
infant
of
some
two
months
was
shot
twice
and
one
leg
nearly
hacked
off
i
know
from
my
own
personal
observations
that
during
the
time
the
indians
were
in
after
my
arrival
they
were
rationed
every
three
days
and
indians
absent
had
to
be
accounted
for
their
faces
soon
became
familiar
to
me
and
i
could
at
once
tell
when
any
strange
indian
came
in
i
furthermore
state
that
i
have
been
among
nearly
all
the
tribes
on
the
pacific
coast
and
that
i
have
never
seen
any
indians
who
showed
the
intelligence
honesty
and
desire
to
learn
manifested
by
these
indians
i
came
among
them
greatly
prejudiced
against
them
but
after
being
with
them
i
was
compelled
to
admit
that
they
were
honest
in
their
intentions
and
really
desired
peace

this
is
not
the
only
instance
of
cruel
outrage
committed
by
white
men

the
apaches
in
the
report
of
the
board
of
indian
commissioners
for
is
the
following
letter
from
one
of
the
arizona
pioneers
lyman
of
northampton
mass
lyman
spent
the
years
of
among
the
apaches
and
thus
briefly
relates
an
occurrence
which
took
place
at
a
time
when
they
were
friendly
and
cordial
to
all
americans
going
among
them
the
indians
were
then
as
now
hostile
to
the
mexicans
of
sonora
and
they
were
constantly
making
raids
into
the
state
and
driving
off
the
cattle
the
mexicans
feared
them
and
were
unable
to
meet
them
man
to
man
at
that
time
american
trappers
found
the
beaver
very
abundant
about
the
of
the
gila
river
among
those
rich
mountain
valleys
where
the
apaches
had
and
still
have
their
secure
retreats
at
the
time
i
speak
of
there
were
two
companies
of
trappers
in
that
region
one
of
the
companies
about
seventeen
men
was
under
a
captain
named
johnson
the
other
company
consisted
of
thirty
men
i
think
i
was
trapping
on
another
head
of
the
gila
several
miles
north
the
valleys
were
full
of
apaches
but
all
peaceful
toward
the
white
men
both
indians
and
whites
visiting
each
other
camps
constantly
and
fearlessly
with
no
thought
of
treachery
or
evil
besides
the
mexicans
the
only
enemies
of
the
apaches
were
the
piutes
and
navajoes
in
the
but
here
in
their
fastnesses
they
felt
safe
from
all
foes
one
day
johnson
concluded
to
go
down
into
sonora
on
a
spree
as
was
occasionally
the
way
with
he
there
saw
the
governor
of
sonora
who
knowing
that
he
had
the
confidence
of
the
indians
offered
him
an
ounce
of
gold
for
every
apache
scalp
he
would
bring
him
the
bargain
was
struck
johnson
procured
a
small
mountain
howitzer
and
then
with
supplies
for
his
party
returned
to
his
camp
previous
to
entering
it
he
loaded
his
howitzer
with
a
quantity
of
bullets
on
approaching
the
valley
he
was
met
by
the
indians
who
joyfully
welcomed
him
back
and
proceeded
at
once
to
prepare
the
usual
feast
while
they
were
boiling
and
roasting
their
venison
and
bear
meat
and
were
gathered
in
a
small
group
around
the
fire
laughing
and
chatting
in
anticipation
of
the
pleasure
they
expected
in
entertaining
their
guests
johnson
told
those
of
his
party
who
had
remained
behind
of
the
offer
of
the
governor
and
with
such
details
of
temptation
as
easily
overcame
any
scruples
such
men
might
have
as
they
were
all
armed
with
rifles
which
were
always
in
hand
day
and
night
together
with
pistols
in
belt
they
needed
no
preparation
the
howitzer
which
the
indians
might
have
supposed
to
be
a
small
keg
of
whiskey
was
placed
on
the
ground
and
pointed
at
the
group
of
warriors
squaws
and
little
children
round
the
fire
watching
the
roasting
meal
while
they
were
thus
engaged
with
hearts
full
of
kindly
feelings
toward
their
white
friends
johnson
gave
the
signal
the
howitzer
was
discharged
sending
its
load
of
bullets
scattering
and
tearing
through
the
mass
of
miserable
human
beings
and
nearly
all
who
were
not
stricken
down
were
shot
by
the
rifles
a
very
few
succeeded
in
escaping
into
the
ravine
and
fled
over
the
dividing
ridge
into
the
northern
valleys
where
they
met
others
of
their
tribe
to
whom
they
told
the
horrible
story
the
apaches
at
once
showed
that
they
could
imitate
their
more
civilized
brothers
immediately
a
band
of
them
went
in
search
of
the
other
company
of
trappers
who
of
course
were
utterly
unconscious
of
infernal
work
they
were
attacked
unprepared
and
nearly
all
killed
and
then
the
story
that
the
apaches
were
treacherous
and
cruel
went
forth
into
all
the
land
but
nothing
of
the
wrongs
they
had
received
is
it
to
be
wondered
at
that
the
apaches
became
one
of
the
most
hostile
and
dangerous
tribes
on
the
pacific
coast
these
are
but
four
massacres
out
of
scores
whose
history
if
written
would
prove
as
clearly
as
do
these
that
in
the
long
contest
between
white
men
and
indians
the
indian
has
not
always
been
the
aggressor
and
that
treachery
and
cruelty
are
by
no
means
exclusively
indian
traits
chapter
x
conclusion
there
are
within
the
limits
of
the
united
states
between
two
hundred
and
fifty
and
three
hundred
thousand
indians
exclusive
of
those
in
alaska
the
names
of
the
different
tribes
and
bands
as
entered
in
the
statistical
tables
of
the
indian
office
reports
number
nearly
three
hundred
one
of
the
most
careful
estimates
which
have
been
made
of
their
numbers
and
localities
gives
them
as
follows
in
minnesota
and
states
east
of
the
mississippi
about
in
nebraska
kansas
and
the
indian
territory
in
the
territories
of
dakota
montana
wyoming
and
idaho
in
nevada
and
the
territories
of
colorado
new
mexico
utah
and
arizona
and
on
the
pacific
slope
of
these
are
on
their
own
reservations
receiving
nothing
from
the
government
except
interest
on
their
own
moneys
or
annuities
granted
them
in
consideration
of
the
cession
of
their
lands
to
the
united
states
footnote
a
annual
report
of
indian
commissioner
for
this
fact
alone
would
seem
sufficient
to
dispose
forever
of
the
accusation
so
persistently
brought
against
the
indian
that
he
will
not
work
of
the
remainder
are
partially
supported
by
the
interest
money
due
them
and
their
annuities
as
provided
by
treaty
being
inadequate
to
their
subsistence
on
the
reservations
where
they
are
confined
in
many
cases
however
these
indians
furnish
a
large
part
of
their
white
river
utes
for
instance
who
are
reported
by
the
indian
bureau
as
getting
per
cent
of
their
living
by
hunting
and
fishing
the
squaxin
band
in
washington
territory
as
earning
per
and
the
chippewas
of
lake
superior
as
earning
fifty
per
cent
in
the
same
way
these
facts
also
would
seem
to
dispose
of
the
accusation
that
the
indian
will
not
work
there
are
about
who
never
visit
an
agency
over
whom
the
government
does
not
pretend
to
have
either
control
or
care
these
subsist
by
hunting
fishing
on
roots
nuts
berries
and
by
begging
and
stealing
and
this
also
seems
to
dispose
of
the
accusation
that
the
indian
will
not
work
for
a
living
there
remains
a
small
portion
about
that
are
entirely
subsisted
by
the
government
there
is
not
among
these
three
hundred
bands
of
indians
one
which
has
not
suffered
cruelly
at
the
hands
either
of
the
government
or
of
white
settlers
the
poorer
the
more
insignificant
the
more
helpless
the
band
the
more
certain
the
cruelty
and
outrage
to
which
they
have
been
subjected
this
is
especially
true
of
the
bands
on
the
pacific
slope
these
indians
found
themselves
of
a
sudden
surrounded
by
and
caught
up
in
the
great
influx
of
settlers
as
helpless
creatures
on
a
shore
are
caught
up
in
a
tidal
wave
there
was
not
time
for
the
government
to
make
treaties
not
even
time
for
communities
to
make
laws
the
tale
of
the
wrongs
the
oppressions
the
murders
of
the
indians
in
the
last
thirty
years
would
be
a
volume
by
itself
and
is
too
monstrous
to
be
believed
it
makes
little
difference
however
where
one
opens
the
record
of
the
history
of
the
indians
every
page
and
every
year
has
its
dark
stain
the
story
of
one
tribe
is
the
story
of
all
varied
only
by
differences
of
time
and
place
but
neither
time
nor
place
makes
any
difference
in
the
main
facts
colorado
is
as
greedy
and
unjust
in
as
was
georgia
in
and
ohio
in
and
the
united
states
government
breaks
promises
now
as
deftly
as
then
and
with
an
added
ingenuity
from
long
practice
one
of
its
strongest
supports
in
so
doing
is
the
sentiment
among
the
people
of
dislike
to
the
indian
of
impatience
with
his
presence
as
a
barrier
to
civilization
and
distrust
of
it
as
a
possible
danger
the
old
tales
of
the
frontier
life
with
its
horrors
of
indian
warfare
have
gradually
by
two
or
three
generations
telling
produced
in
the
average
mind
something
like
an
hereditary
instinct
of
unquestioning
and
unreasoning
aversion
which
it
is
almost
impossible
to
dislodge
or
soften
there
are
hundreds
of
pages
of
unimpeachable
testimony
on
the
side
of
the
indian
but
it
goes
for
nothing
is
set
down
as
sentimentalism
or
partisanship
tossed
aside
and
forgotten
president
after
president
has
appointed
commission
after
commission
to
inquire
into
and
report
upon
indian
affairs
and
to
make
suggestions
as
to
the
best
methods
of
managing
them
the
reports
are
filled
with
eloquent
statements
of
wrongs
done
to
the
indians
of
perfidies
on
the
part
of
the
government
they
counsel
as
earnestly
as
words
can
a
trial
of
the
simple
and
unperplexing
expedients
of
telling
truth
keeping
promises
making
fair
bargains
dealing
justly
in
all
ways
and
all
things
these
reports
are
bound
up
with
the
government
annual
reports
and
that
is
the
end
of
them
it
would
probably
be
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
not
one
american
citizen
out
of
ten
thousand
ever
sees
them
or
knows
that
they
exist
and
yet
any
one
of
them
circulated
throughout
the
country
read
by
the
men
and
women
of
this
land
would
be
of
itself
a
campaign
document
that
would
initiate
a
revolution
which
would
not
subside
until
the
indians
wrongs
were
so
far
as
is
now
left
possible
righted
in
president
grant
appointed
a
commission
of
nine
men
representing
the
influence
and
philanthropy
of
six
leading
states
to
visit
the
different
indian
reservations
and
to
examine
all
matters
appertaining
to
indian
affairs
in
the
report
of
this
commission
are
such
paragraphs
as
the
following
to
assert
that
indian
will
not
work
is
as
true
as
it
would
be
to
say
that
the
white
man
will
not
work
why
should
the
indian
be
expected
to
plant
corn
fence
lands
build
houses
or
do
anything
but
get
food
from
day
to
day
when
experience
has
taught
him
that
the
product
of
his
labor
will
be
seized
by
the
white
man
the
most
industrious
white
man
would
become
a
drone
under
similar
circumstances
nevertheless
many
of
the
indians
the
commissioners
might
more
forcibly
have
said
of
the
indians
are
already
at
work
and
furnish
ample
refutation
of
the
assertion
that
indian
will
not
work
there
is
no
escape
from
the
inexorable
logic
of
facts
the
history
of
the
government
connections
with
the
indians
is
a
shameful
record
of
broken
treaties
and
unfulfilled
promises
the
history
of
the
border
white
man
connection
with
the
indians
is
a
sickening
record
of
murder
outrage
robbery
and
wrongs
committed
by
the
former
as
the
rule
and
occasional
savage
outbreaks
and
unspeakably
barbarous
deeds
of
retaliation
by
the
latter
as
the
exception
taught
by
the
government
that
they
had
rights
entitled
to
respect
when
those
rights
have
been
assailed
by
the
rapacity
of
the
white
man
the
arm
which
should
have
been
raised
to
protect
them
has
ever
been
ready
to
sustain
the
aggressor
the
testimony
of
some
of
the
highest
military
officers
of
the
united
states
is
on
record
to
the
effect
that
in
our
indian
wars
almost
without
exception
the
first
aggressions
have
been
made
by
the
white
man
and
the
assertion
is
supported
by
every
civilian
of
reputation
who
has
studied
the
subject
in
addition
to
the
class
of
robbers
and
outlaws
who
find
impunity
in
their
nefarious
pursuits
on
the
frontiers
there
is
a
large
class
of
professedly
reputable
men
who
use
every
means
in
their
power
to
bring
on
indian
wars
for
the
sake
of
the
profit
to
be
realized
from
the
presence
of
troops
and
the
expenditure
of
government
funds
in
their
midst
they
proclaim
death
to
the
indians
at
all
times
in
words
and
publications
making
no
distinction
between
the
innocent
and
the
guilty
they
irate
the
lowest
class
of
men
to
the
perpetration
of
the
darkest
deeds
against
their
victims
and
as
judges
and
jurymen
shield
them
from
the
justice
due
to
their
crimes
every
crime
committed
by
a
white
man
against
an
indian
is
concealed
or
palliated
every
offence
committed
by
an
indian
against
a
white
man
is
borne
on
the
wings
of
the
post
or
the
telegraph
to
the
remotest
corner
of
the
land
clothed
with
all
the
horrors
which
the
reality
or
imagination
can
throw
around
it
against
such
influences
as
these
the
people
of
the
united
states
need
to
be
warned
to
assume
that
it
would
be
easy
or
by
any
one
sudden
stroke
of
legislative
policy
possible
to
undo
the
mischief
and
hurt
of
the
long
past
set
the
indian
policy
of
the
country
right
for
the
future
and
make
the
indians
at
once
safe
and
happy
is
the
blunder
of
a
hasty
and
uninformed
judgment
the
notion
which
seems
to
be
growing
more
prevalent
that
simply
to
make
all
indians
at
once
citizens
of
the
united
states
would
be
a
sovereign
and
instantaneous
panacea
for
all
their
ills
and
all
the
government
perplexities
is
a
very
inconsiderate
one
to
administer
complete
citizenship
of
a
sudden
all
round
to
all
indians
barbarous
and
civilized
alike
would
be
as
grotesque
a
blunder
as
to
dose
them
all
round
with
any
one
medicine
irrespective
of
the
symptoms
and
needs
of
their
diseases
it
would
kill
more
than
it
would
cure
nevertheless
it
is
true
as
was
well
stated
by
one
of
the
superintendents
of
indian
affairs
in
that
so
long
as
they
are
not
citizens
of
the
united
states
their
rights
of
property
must
remain
insecure
against
invasion
the
doors
of
the
federal
tribunals
being
barred
against
them
while
wards
and
dependents
they
can
only
partially
exercise
the
rights
of
free
government
or
give
to
those
who
make
execute
and
construe
the
few
laws
they
are
allowed
to
enact
dignity
sufficient
to
make
them
respectable
while
they
continue
individually
to
gather
the
crumbs
that
fall
from
the
table
of
the
united
states
idleness
improvidence
and
indebtedness
will
be
the
rule
and
industry
thrift
and
freedom
from
debt
the
exception
the
utter
absence
of
individual
title
to
particular
lands
deprives
every
one
among
them
of
the
chief
incentive
to
labor
and
very
mainspring
on
which
the
prosperity
of
a
people
depends
all
judicious
plans
and
measures
for
their
safety
and
salvation
must
embody
provisions
for
their
becoming
citizens
as
fast
as
they
are
fit
and
must
protect
them
till
then
in
every
right
and
particular
in
which
our
laws
protect
other
persons
who
are
not
citizens
there
is
a
disposition
in
a
certain
class
of
minds
to
be
impatient
with
any
protestation
against
wrong
which
is
unaccompanied
or
unprepared
with
a
quick
and
exact
scheme
of
remedy
this
is
illogical
when
pioneers
in
a
new
country
find
a
tract
of
poisonous
and
swampy
wilderness
to
be
reclaimed
they
do
not
withhold
their
hands
from
fire
and
axe
till
they
see
clearly
which
way
roads
should
run
where
good
water
will
spring
and
what
crops
will
best
grow
on
the
redeemed
land
they
first
clear
the
swamp
so
with
this
poisonous
and
baffling
part
of
the
domain
of
our
national
us
first
clear
the
swamp
however
great
perplexity
and
difficulty
there
may
be
in
the
details
of
any
and
every
plan
possible
for
doing
at
this
late
day
anything
like
justice
to
the
indian
however
hard
it
may
be
for
good
statesmen
and
good
men
to
agree
upon
the
things
that
ought
to
be
done
there
certainly
is
or
ought
to
be
no
perplexity
whatever
no
difficulty
whatever
in
agreeing
upon
certain
things
that
ought
not
to
be
done
and
which
must
cease
to
be
done
before
the
first
steps
can
be
taken
toward
righting
the
wrongs
curing
the
ills
and
wiping
out
the
disgrace
to
us
of
the
present
condition
of
our
indians
cheating
robbing
breaking
three
are
clearly
things
which
must
cease
to
be
done
one
more
thing
also
and
that
is
the
refusal
of
the
protection
of
the
law
to
the
indian
rights
of
property
of
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
when
these
four
things
have
ceased
to
be
done
time
statesmanship
philanthropy
and
christianity
can
slowly
and
surely
do
the
rest
till
these
four
things
have
ceased
to
be

appendix
i
the
sand
creek
massacre
the
following
letters
were
printed
in
the
york
in
the
winter
of
they
are
of
interest
not
only
as
giving
a
minute
account
of
one
of
the
most
atrocious
massacres
ever
perpetrated
but
also
as
showing
the
sense
of
justice
which
is
to
be
found
in
the
frontiersman
mind
that
men
exasperated
by
atrocities
and
outrages
should
have
avenged
themselves
with
hot
haste
and
cruelty
was
perhaps
only
human
but
that
men
should
be
found
fifteen
years
later
apologizing
for
nay
justifying
the
cruel
deed
is
indeed
a
matter
of
marvel
letter
i
in
june
governor
evans

colorado
sent
out
a
circular
to
the

been
committed
by

about
to
make
war
upon
them
this
circular
says
in
some
instances
they
the
indians
have
attacked
and
killed
soldiers
and
murdered
peaceable
citizens
for
this
the
great
father
is
angry
and
will
certainly
hunt
them
out
and
punish
them
but
he
does
not
want
to
injure
those
who
remain
friendly
to
the
whites
he
desires
to
protect
and
take
care
of
them
for
this
purpose
i
direct
that
all
friendly
indians
keep
away
from
those
who
are
at
war

go
to

toward
the
soldiers
holding
up
his

crying

stop
in
english
when
he
saw
that

no
mistake

it
was
a
deliberate
attack

folded
his
arms

waited
till

the
most
horrible
manner

in
such
a
manner
that
the
recital
is
sickening
colonel
chivington
all
the
time
inciting
his
troops
to
their
diabolical
outrages

up
to
her
with
a
drawn
sabre

arm
to
protect
herself
he
struck
breaking

and
then

her
i

one
squaw

major
anthony
testified
there
was
one
little
child
probably
three
years
old
just
big
enough
to
walk
through
the
sand
the
indians
had
gone
ahead
and
this
little
child
was
behind
following
after
them
the
little
fellow
was
perfectly
naked
travelling
in
the
sand
i
saw
one
man
get
off
his
horse
at
a
distance
of
about
yards
and
draw
up
his
rifle
and
fire
he
missed

hit
him
he
got
down

his
horse
kneeled
down
and
fired
at
the
little
child
but
he
missed
him
a
third
man
came
up
and
made
a
similar
remark
and
fired
and
the
little
fellow
dropped
the
indians
were
not
able
to
make
much
resistance
as
only
a
part
of
them
were
armed
the
united
states
officers
having
required
them
to
give
up
their
guns
luckily
they
had
kept
a
few
when
this
colorado
regiment
of
demons
returned
to
denver
they
were
greeted
with
an
ovation
denver
said
all
acquitted
themselves
well
colorado
soldiers
have
again
covered
themselves
with
glory
and
at
a
theatrical
performance
given
in
the
city
these
scalps
taken
from
indians
were
held
up
and
exhibited
to
the
audience
which
applauded
rapturously
after
listening
day
after
day
to
such
testimonies
as
these
i
have
quoted
and
others
so
much
worse
that
i
may
not
write
and
could
not
print
the
words
needful
to
tell
them
the
committee
reported
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
beings
in
the
form
of
men
and
disgracing
the
uniform
of
united
states
soldiers
and
officers
could
commit
or
countenance
the
commission
of
such
acts
of
cruelty
and
barbarity
and
of
colonel
chivington
he
deliberately
planned
and
executed
a
foul
and
dastardly
massacre
which
would
have
disgraced
the
veriest
savage
among
those
who
were
the
victims
of
his
cruelty
this
was
just
fifteen
years
ago
no
more
shall
we
apply
the
same
rule
of
judgment
to
the
white
men
of
colorado
that
the
government
is
now
applying
to
the
utes
there
are
inhabitants
of
colorado
hundreds
of
them
had
a
hand
in
this
massacre
and
thousands
in
cool
blood
applauded
it
when
it
was
done
there
are
utes
in
colorado
twelve
of
them
desperate
guilty
men
have
committed
murder
and
rape
and
three
or
four
hundred
of
them
did
in
the
convenient
phrase
of
our
diplomacy
go
to
war
against
the
government
they
attempted
by
force
of
arms
to
restrain
the
entrance
upon
their
own
bought
owned
and
paid
soldiers
that
the
government
had
sent
there
to
be
ready
to
make
way
upon
them
in
case
the
agent
thought
it
best
to
do
so
this
is
the
plain
english
of
it
this
is
the
plain
naked
truth
of
it
and
now
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
stopped
the
issue
of
rations
to
of
these
helpless
creatures
rations
be
it
understood
which
are
not
and
never
were
a
charity
but
are
the
utes
rightful
dues
on
account
of
lands
by
them
sold
dues
which
the
government
promised
to
pay
annually
forever
will
the
american
people
justify
this
there
is
such
a
thing
as
the
conscience
of
a
a
nation
sense
of
justice
can
it
not
be
roused
to
speak
now
shall
we
sit
still
warm
and
well
fed
in
our
homes
while
five
hundred
women
and
little
children
are
being
slowly
starved
in
the
bleak
barren
wildernesses
of
colorado
starved
not
because
storm
or
blight
or
drouth
has
visited
their
country
and
cut
off
their
crops
not
because
pestilence
has
laid
its
hand
on
them
and
slain
the
hunters
who
brought
them
meat
but
because
it
lies
within
the
promise
of
one
man
by
one
word
to
deprive
them
of
their
necessary
food
for
as
long
a
term
of
years
as
he
may
please
and
the
secretary
of
the
interior
can
not
consistently
feed
a
tribe
that
has
gone
to
war
against
the
government
we
read
in
the
statutes
of
the
united
states
that
certain
things
may
be
done
by
executive
order
of
the
president
is
it
not
time
for
a
president
to
interfere
when
hundreds
of
women
and
children
are
being
starved
in
his
republic
by
the
order
of
one
man
colonel
chivington
method
was
less
inhuman
by
far
to
be
shot
dead
is
a
mercy
and
a
grace
for
which
we
would
all
sue
if
to
be
starved
to
death
were
our
only

this
letter
drew
from
the
former
editor
of
the
mountain
a
denver
newspaper
the
following
reply
letter
ii
the
editor
of
the
sir
your
edition
of
yesterday
appears
an
article
under
the
above
caption
which
arraigns
the
people
of
colorado
as
a
community
of
barbarous
murderers
and
finally
elevates
them
above
the
present
secretary
of
the
interior
thereby
placing
the
latter
gentleman
in
a
most
unenviable
light
if
the
charges
averred
be
true
the
sand
creek
massacre
of
is
made
the
text
and
burden
of
the
article
its
application
is
to
the
present
condition
of
the
white
river
band
of
utes
in
colorado
quotations
are
given
from
the
testimony
gathered
and
the
report
made
thereon
by
a
committee
of
congress
charged
with
a
investigation
of
the
sand
creek
affair
that
investigation
was
made
for
a
certain
selfish
purpose
it
was
to
break
down
and
ruin
certain
men
evidence
was
taken
upon
one
side
only
it
was
largely
false
and
infamously
partial
there
was
no
answer
for
the
defence
the
cheyenne
and
arapahoe
indians
assembled
at
sand
creek
were
not
under
the
protection
of
a
united
states
fort
a
few
of
them
had
been
encamped
about
fort
lyon
and
drawing
supplies
therefrom
but
they
had
gradually
disappeared
and
joined
the
main
camp
on
dry
sandy
forty
miles
from
the
fort
separated
from
it
by
a
waterless
desert
and
entirely
beyond
the
limit
of
its
control
or
observation
while
some
of
the
occupants
were
still
no
doubt
occasional
visitors
at
the
fort
and
applicants
for
supplies
and
ammunition
most
of
the
warriors
were
engaged
in
raiding
the
great
platte
river
road
miles
farther
north
robbing
and
burning
trains
stealing
cattle
and
horses
robbing
and
destroying
the
united
states
mails
and
killing
white
people
during
the
summer
and
fall
they
had
murdered
over
fifty
of
the
citizens
of
colorado
they
had
stolen
and
destroyed
provisions
and
merchandise
and
driven
away
stock
worth
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
they
had
interrupted
the
mails
and
for
consecutive
days
none
were
allowed
to
pass
their
lines
when
satiated
with
murder
and
arson
and
loaded
with
plunder
they
would
retire
to
their
sacred
refuge
on
sand
creek
to
rest
and
refresh
themselves
recruit
their
wasted
supplies
of
ammunition
from
fort
under
the
garb
of
gentle
peaceful
then
return
to
the
road
to
relieve
their
tired
comrades
and
riot
again
in
carnage
and
robbery
these
are
facts
and
when
the
robbers
roost
was
cleaned
out
on
that
sad
but
glorious
day
of
november
they
were
sufficiently
proven
scalps
of
white
men
not
yet
dried
letters
and
photographs
stolen
from
the
mails
bills
of
lading
and
invoices
of
goods
bales
and
bolts
of
the
goods
themselves
addressed
to
merchants
in
denver
clothing
of
white
women
and
children
and
many
other
articles
of
like
character
were
found
in
that
poetical
indian
camp
and
recovered
by
the
colorado
soldiers
they
were
brought
to
denver
and
those
were
the
scalps
exhibited
in
the
theatre
of
that
city
there
was
also
an
indian
entirely
fringed
around
the
edges
with
white
women
scalps
with
the
long
fair
hair
attached
there
was
an
indian
saddle
over
the
pommel
of
which
was
stretched
skin
stripped
from
the
body
of
a
white
woman
is
it
any
wonder
that
soldiers
flushed
with
victory
after
one
of
the
hardest
campaigns
ever
endured
by
men
should
of
unwarranted
atrocities
after
finding
such
evidence
of
barbarism
and
while
more
than
forty
of
their
comrades
were
weltering
in
their
own
blood
upon
the
field
if
had
been
in
denver
in
the
early
part
of
that
summer
when
the
bloated
festering
bodies
of
the
hungate
mother
and
two
drawn
through
the
streets
naked
in
an
cut
mutilated
and
work
of
those
same
red
fiends
who
were
so
justly
punished
at
sand
creek
if
later
had
seen
an
upright
and
most
estimable
business
man
go
crazy
over
the
news
of
his
being
tortured
to
death
a
hundred
miles
down
the
platte
as
i
did
if
had
seen
the
colorado
homes
made
desolate
that
fateful
season
and
a
tithe
of
the
tears
that
were
caused
to
flow
i
think
there
would
have
been
one
little
word
of
excuse
for
the
people
of
than
a
doubtful
comparison
with
an
inefficient
and
culpable
indian
policy
bear
in
mind
that
colorado
had
no
railroads
then
her
supplies
reached
her
by
only
one
the
wagons
drawn
by
oxen
mules
or
horses
that
line
was
in
full
possession
of
the
enemy
starvation
stared
us
in
the
face
hardly
a
party
went
or
came
without
some
persons
being
killed
in
some
instances
whole
trains
were
cut
off
and
destroyed
sand
creek
saved
colorado
and
taught
the
indians
the
most
salutary
lesson
they
had
ever
learned
and
now
after
fifteen
years
and
here
in
the
shadow
of
the
nation
capitol
with
the
spectre
of
condemnation
staring
me
in
the
face
i
am
neither
afraid
nor
ashamed
to
repeat
the
language
then
used
by
denver
all
acquitted
themselves
well
colorado
soldiers
have
again
covered
themselves
with
glory
thus
much
of
history
is
gone
over
by
to
present
in
true
dramatic
form
the
deplorable
condition
of
the
white
river
utes
in
number
who
are
now
suffering
the
pangs
of
hunger
and
the
discomfort
of
cold
in
the
wilds
of
western
colorado
without
any
kind
agent
to
issue
rations
provide
blankets
or
build
fires
for
them
it
is
really
too
bad
a
painful
dispensation
of
providence
has
deprived
them
of
their
best
friend
and
they
are
desolate
and
bereaved
he
placed
his
life
and
its
best
efforts
his
unbounded
enthusiasm
for
their
good
his
great
christian
at
their
service
but
an
accident
befell
him
and
he
is
no
more
the
coroner
jury
that
sat
upon
his
remains
found
that
his
dead
body
had
a
barrel
stave
driven
into
his
mouth
a
around
his
neck
by
which
it
had
been
dragged
about
like
a
dead
hog
and
sundry
through
his
body
the
presumption
was
that
from
the
effect
of
some
one
of
these
accidents
he
died
and
alas
he
is
no
longer
to
serve
out
weekly
rations
to
his
flock
of
gentle
utes
there
is
no
sorrow
over
his
death
or
the
desolation
it
wrought
but
there
is
pity
oceans
of
pity
for
the
indians
who
are
hungry
and
cold
true
at
the
time
he
died
they
took
the
flour
the
pork
and
salt
and
coffee
and
sugar
and
tobacco
and
blankets
and
all
the
other
supplies
that
he
would
have
issued
to
them
through
all
this
long
winter
had
he
lived
with
his
care
these
would
have
lasted
until
spring
and
been
sufficient
for
their
wants
but
without
it
is
suspicious
that
they
are
all
gone
and
yet
it
is
but
just
past
the
middle
of
winter
can
tell
why
this
is
thus
it
is
also
true
that
they
drove
away
the
large
herd
of
cattle
from
the
increase
of
which
that
same
unfortunate
agent
and
his
predecessors
had
supplied
them
with
beef
for
eleven
years
past
and
yet
the
consumption
did
not
keep
pace
with
the
natural
increase
they
took
them
all
and
are
presumed
to
have
them
now
true
again
they
had
at
the
beginning
of
winter
or
at
the
period
of
the
melancholy
loss
of
their
best
friend
about
horses
that
were
rolling
fat
and
three
acres
of
bad
food
in
an
emergency
or
for
an
indian
thanksgiving
of
which
should
still
remain
the
whole
white
river
band
guilty
but
intimates
that
there
is
an
alleged
excuse
for
withholding
rations
from
these
poor
persecuted
red
angels
twelve
of
them
have
been
bad
and
the
tyrant
at
the
head
of
the
interior
department
is
systematically
starving
all
of
the
who
constitute
the
band
and
their
horses
and
cattle
and
three
acres
of
dogs
and
six
months
supplies
because
those
twelve
bad
indians
can
not
conscientiously
pick
themselves
out
and
be
offered
up
as
a
and
a
sacrifice
to
appease
the
wrath
of
an
outraged
and
partly
civilized
nation
this
is
the
present
indictment
and
the
secretary
and
the
president
are
commanded
to
stand
up
and
plead
guilty
or
not
guilty
but
you
know
you
are
guilty
you
now
i
challenge
and
defy
or
any
other
person
living
to
pick
out
or
name
twelve
white
river
male
utes
over
sixteen
years
of
age
who
were
guilty
directly
or
indirectly
as
principals
or
accomplices
before
the
fact
in
the
thornburgh
attack
or
in
the
agency
massacre
i
know
these
indians
well
enough
to
know
that
these
attacks
were
perfectly
understood
and
deliberately
planned
i
can
not
be
made
to
believe
that
a
single
one
of
them
of
and
intelligence
was
ignorant
of
what
was
to
take
place
and
that
knowledge
extended
far
beyond
the
white
river
band
there
were
plenty
of
recruits
from
both
the
los
pinos
and
the
uintah
bands
in
withholding
supplies
from
the
white
river
utes
the
secretary
of
the
interior
is
simply
obeying
the
law
he
can
not
except
upon
his
own
personal
responsibility
issue
supplies
to
a
hostile
indian
tribe
and
the
country
will
hold
him
accountable
for
a
departure
from
his
line
of
duty
inferentially
the
indians
are
justified
by
in
their
attack
upon
thornburgh
command
their
object
was
to
defend
their
own
bought
owned
and
paid
for
bought
of
whom
pray
paid
for
by
whom
to
whom
was
payment
made
the
soldiers
were
making
no
attack
they
contemplated
none
the
agent
had
no
authority
to
order
an
attack
he
could
not
proclaim
war
he
could
have
no
control
whatever
over
the
troops
but
his
life
was
in
danger
the
honor
of
his
family
was
at
stake
he
asked
for
protection
says
he
had
no
right
to
it
his
life
and
the
honor
of
his
aged
wife
and
of
his
virgin
daughter
are
gone
and
is
the
champion
of
fiends
who
wrought
the
ruin

the
most
fitting
reply
to
the
assertions
in
this
extraordinary
document
was
by
still
further
citations
from
the
sworn
testimony
given
before
the
congressional
with
which
volumes
could
have
been
filled
letter
iii
the
editor
of
the
sir
reply
to
the
letter
in
sunday
headed
the
starving
utes
i
would
like
to
place
before
the
readers
of
some
extracts
from
sworn
testimony
taken
in
colorado
on
the
subject
of
the
sand
creek
massacre
the
writer
of
this
letter
says
the
cheyenne
and
arapahoe
indians
assembled
at
sand
creek
were
not
under
the
protection
of
a
united
states
fort
the
following
testimony
is
that
of
lieutenant
craven
senate
document
vol
i
had
some
conversation
with
major
downing
lieutenant
maynard
and
colonel
chivington
i
stated
to
them
my
feelings
in
regard
to
the
i
believed
it
to
be
stated
the
obligations
that
we
of
major
wynkoop
command
were
under
to
those
indians
to
colonel
chivington
i
know
i
stated
that
major
wynkoop
had
pledged
his
word
as
an
officer
and
man
to
those
indians
and
that
all
officers
under
him
were
indirectly
pledged
in
the
same
manner
that
he
was
and
that
i
felt
that
it
was
placing
us
in
very
embarrassing
circumstances
to
fight
the
same
indians
that
had
saved
our
lives
as
we
all
felt
that
they
had
colonel
chivington
reply
was
that
he
believed
it
to
be
right
and
honorable
to
use
any
means
under
god
heaven
to
kill
indians
that
would
kill
women
and
children
and
any
one
that
was
in
sympathy
with
indians
and
men
as
major
wynkoop
and
myself
had
better
get
out
of
the
united
states
service
this
conversation
was
testified
to
by
other
witnesses
major
wynkoop
it
will
be
remembered
was
the
officer
in
command
at
fort
lyon
when
this
band
of
cheyennes
and
arapahoes
came
in
there
to
claim
protection
in
consequence
of
the
governor
proclamation
saying
that
all
friendly
arapahoes
and
cheyennes
belonging
on
the
arkansas
river
will
go
to
major
colby
united
states
indian
agent
at
fort
lyon
who
will
give
them
provisions
and
show
them
a
place
of
safety
major
wynkoop
was
succeeded
in
the
command
of
fort
lyon
by
major
anthony
who
continued
for
a
time
to
issue
rations
to
these
indians
as
major
wynkoop
had
done
but
after
a
time
he
called
them
together
and
told
them
he
could
not
feed
them
any
longer
they
would
better
go
where
they
could
hunt
selected
the
place
to
which
they
were
to
move
on
sandy
they
obeyed
and
he
gave
back
to
them
some
of
the
arms
which
had
been
taken
away
they
were
moved
to
sandy
creek
about
forty
miles
from
fort
lyon
partly
for
fear
of
some
conflict
between
them
and
the
soldiers
or
emigrants
fort
lyon
being
on
a
thoroughfare
of
travel
one
of
the
hired
by
major
anthony
at
a
month
to
obtain
information
for
the
use
of
the
military
authorities
several
times
he
brought
news
to
the
fort
of
proposed
movements
of
hostile
indians
this
chief
was
killed
in
the
massacre
this

did
you
protest
against
attacking
those
indians
i
did
who
was
your
commanding

did
you
inform
major

of
the
relations
existing
with

i
did
he
knew
the
relations
i
frequently
talked
to
him
about
it
what
answer
did
major
anthony
make
to
your
protests
he
said
that
we
were
going
to
fight
the
hostile
indians
at
smoky
hill
he
also
said
that
he
was
in
for
killing
all
indians
and
that
he
had
only
been
acting
friendly
with
them
until
he
could
get
a
force
large
enough
to
go
out
and
kill
all
of
them
this
is
the
testimony
of
brown
colonel
chivington
in
a
public
speech
said
his
policy
was
to
kill
and
scalp
all
little
and
big
nits
made

one
of
the
earliest
settlers
in
colorado
he
was
united
states
marshal
delegate
to
congress
and
afterward
governor
of
the
territory
we
have
always
regarded
black
kettle
and
white
antelope
as
the
special
friends
of
the
white
man
ever
since
i
have
been
in
this
country
do
you

any
acts

committed
by

with
their
consent

commanding

in
conclusion
allow
me
to
say
that
from
the
time
i
held
the
consultation
with
the
indian
chiefs
on
the
of
smoky
hill
up
to
the
date
of
this
massacre
by
colonel
chivington
not
one
single
depredation
had
been
committed
by
the
cheyenne
and
arapahoe
indians
the
settlers
of
the
arkansas
valley
had
returned
to
their
ranches
from
which
they
had
fled
had
taken
in
their
crops
and
had
been
resting
in
perfect
security
under
assurances
from
myself
that
they
would
be
in
no
danger
for
the
present
since
this
last
horrible
murder
by
colonel
chivington
the
country
presents
a
scene
of
desolation
all
communication
is
cut
off
with
the
states
except
by
sending
large
bodies
of
troops
and
already
over
a
hundred
whites
have
fallen
victims
to
the
fearful
vengeance
of
these
betrayed
indians
january
the
writer
of
this
letter
says
in
regard
to
the
investigation
of
the
sand
creek
massacre
by
the
congressional
committee
that
evidence
was
taken
upon
one
side
only
and
there
was
no
answer
for
the
defence
a
large
part
of
the
testimony
is
sworn
evidence
given
by
the
governor
of
colorado
by
colonel
chivington
himself
who
planned
and
executed
the
massacre
and
by
major
anthony
who
accompanied
him
with
troops
from
fort
lyon
the
writer
of
this
article
says
that
the
investigation
was
made
for
a
certain
selfish
purpose
to
break
down
and
ruin
certain
men
the
names
of
senator
foster
senator
doolittle
and
honest
ben
wade
are
the
best
refutation
of
this
statement
it
will
be
hard
to
impeach
the
trustworthiness
of
reports
signed
by
these
names
and
one
of
these
reports
says
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
beings
in
the
form
of
men
and
disgracing
the
uniform
of
united
states
soldiers
and
officers
could
commit
or
countenance
the
commission
of
such
acts
of
cruelty
and
barbarity
of
colonel
chivington
it
says
he
deliberately
planned
and
executed
a
foul
and
dastardly
massacre
which
would
have
disgraced
the
veriest
savage
among
those
who
were
the
victims
of
his
cruelty
and
of
major
anthony
the
testimony
of
major
anthony
who
succeeded
an
officer
disposed
to
treat
these
indians
with
justice
and
humanity
is
sufficient
of
itself
to
show
how
unprovoked
and
unwarranted
was
this
massacre
he
testifies
that
he
found
these
indians
camped
near
fort
lyon
when
he
assumed
command
of
that
fort
that
they
professed
their
friendliness
to
the
whites
and
their
willingness
to
do
whatever
he
demanded
of
them
that
they
delivered
their
arms
up
to
him
that
they
went
to
and
encamped
on
the
place
designated
by
him
that
they
gave
him
information
from
time
to
time
of
acts
of
hostility
which
were
meditated
by
other
hostile
bands
and
in
every
way
conducted
themselves
properly
and
peaceably
and
yet
he
says
it
was
fear
and
not
principle
which
prevented
his
killing
them
while
they
were
completely
in
his
power
and
when
colonel
chivington
appeared
at
fort
lyon
on
his
mission
of
murder
and
barbarity
major
anthony
made
haste
to
accompany
him
with
men
and
artillery
the
writer
of
this
letter
says
that
the
evidence
given
in
this
investigation
was
largely
false
and
infamously
partial
if
this
were
the
case
why
did
not
all
persons
so
infamously
slandered
see
to
it
that
before
the
year
ended
their
own
version
of
the
affair
should
reach
if
not
the
general
public
at
least
the
department
of
the
interior
why
did
they
leave
it
possible
for
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
incorporate
in
his
annual
report
for
be
read
by
all
the
american
paragraphs
no
official
account
has
ever
reached
this
office
from
its
own
proper
sources
of
the
most
disastrous
and
shameful
occurrence
the
massacre
of
a
large
number
of
men
women
and
children
of
the
indians
of
this
agency
the
upper
arkansas
by
the
troops
under
the
command
of
colonel
chivington
of
the
united
states
volunteer
cavalry
of
colorado
when
several
hundred
of
them
had
come
into
a
place
designated
by
governor
evans
as
a
rendezvous
for
those
who
would
separate
themselves
from
the
hostile
parties
these
indians
were
set
upon
and
butchered
in
cold
blood
by
troops
in
the
service
of
the
united
states
the
few
who
escaped
to
the
northward
told
a
story
which
effectually
prevented
any
more
advances
toward
peace
by
such
of
the
bands
as
were
well
disposed
and
why
did
the
government
of
the
united
states
empower
general
sanborn
in
the
council
held
october
with
the
arapahoes
and
cheyennes
including
the
remnants
of
bands
that
had
escaped
from
the
sand
creek
massacre
to
formally
and
officially
repudiate
the
action
of
the
united
states
soldiers
in
that
massacre
general
sanborn
said
in
this
council
we
all
feel
disgraced
and
ashamed
when
we
see
our
officers
or
soldiers
oppressing
the
weak
or
making
war
on
those
who
are
at
peace
with
us
we
are
willing
as
representatives
of
the
president
to
restore
all
the
property
lost
at
sand
creek
or
its
value
he
has
sent
out
his
commissioners
to
make
reparation
as
far
as
we
can
so
heartily
do
we
repudiate
the
actions
of
our
soldiers
that
we
are
willing
to
give
to
the
chiefs
in
their
own
right
acres
of
land
each
to
hold
as
his
own
forever
and
to
each
of
the
children
and
squaws
who
lost
husbands
or
parents
we
are
also
willing
to
give
acres
of
land
as
their
own
to
keep
as
long
as
they
live
the
writer
of
this
letter
quoting
the
statement
from
a
previous
article
in
that
the
white
river
utes
in
their
attack
on
major
thornburgh
command
fought
to
defend
their
own
bought
owned
and
paid
for
asks
bought
of
whom
pray
paid
for
by
whom
to
whom
was
payment
made
bought
of
the
united
states
government
thereby
recognizing
the
united
states
government
right
to
the
sovereignty
of
the
soil
as
superior
to
the
indians
right
of
occupancy
paid
for
by
the
ute
indians
by
repeated
relinquishments
of
said
right
of
occupancy
in
large
tracts
of
valuable
lands
notably
by
the
relinquishment
according
to
the
brunot
treaty
of
of
acres
of
valuable
lands
unquestionably
rich
in
mineral
deposits
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
for
to
whom
was
payment
made
to
the
united
states
government
which
has
accepted
and
ratified
such
exchanges
of
right
of
occupancy
for
right
of
sovereignty
and
such
sales
of
right
of
occupancy
for
large
sums
of
money
by
repeated
and
reiterated
treaties
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
incorporated
in
his
annual
report
for
in
the
report
on
indian
affairs
the
following
paragraphs
let
it
be
fully
understood
that
the
ute
indians
have
a
good
and
sufficient
title
to
acres
of
land
in
colorado
and
that
these
indians
did
not
thrust
themselves
in
the
way
of
the
white
people
but
that
they
were
originally
and
rightfully
possessors
of
the
soil
and
that
the
land
they
occupy
has
been
acknowledged
to
be
theirs
by
solemn
treaties
made
with
them
by
the
united
states
it
will
not
do
to
say
that
a
treaty
with
an
indian
means
nothing
it
means
even
more
than
the
pledge
of
the
government
to
pay
a
bond
it
is
the
most
solemn
declaration
that
any
government
of
any
people
ever
enters
into
neither
will
it
do
to
say
that
treaties
never
ought
to
have
been
made
with
indians
that
question
is
now
not
in
order
as
the
treaties
have
been
made
and
must
be
lived
up
to
whether
convenient
or
otherwise
by
beginning
at
the
outset
with
the
full
acknowledgment
of
the
absolute
and
indefeasible
right
of
these
indians
to
acres
in
colorado
we
can
properly
consider
what
is
the
best
method
of
extinguishing
the
indian
title
thereto
without
injustice
to
the
indians
and
without
violating
the
plighted
faith
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
the
writer
of
this
letter
says
in
withholding
supplies
from
the
white
river
utes
the
secretary
of
the
interior
is
simply
obeying
the
law
he
can
not
except
upon
his
own
personal
responsibility
issue
supplies
to
a
hostile
indian
tribe
secretary
schurz
has
published
in
the
annual
report
of
the
department
of
the
interior
for
the
following
paragraph
in
regard
to
this
case
of
the
white
river
utes
the
atrocity
of
the
crimes
committed
should
not
prevent
those
individuals
who
are
innocent
from
being
treated
as
such
according
to
article
of
the
treaty
viz
that
if
any
chief

of
the
confederated
bands
make
war
against
the
united
states
or
in
any
manner
violate
this
treaty
in
any
essential
part
said
chief
shall
forfeit
his
position
as
chief
and
all
rights
to
any
of
the
benefits
of
this
treaty
but
any
indian
of
either
of
these
confederated
bands
who
shall
remain
at
peace
and
abide
by
the
terms
of
this
treaty
in
all
its
essentials
shall
be
entitled
to
its
benefits
and
provisions
notwithstanding
his
particular
chief
and

have
forfeited
their
rights
thereto
the
writer
of
this
letter
says
in

this

was
followed
by
a
card
from

reiterating
some
of
his
assertions
and
by
a
second
short
letter
which
closed
the
discussion
the
editor
of
the

ask
only
a
little
space
for
reference
to
the
communication
of
in
it
is
asked
if
the
investigation
of
the
sand
creek
affair
was
so
unfair
why
did
not
the
people
of
colorado
correct
the
false
impression
by
presenting
their
own
version
of
the
case
the
answer
is
that
the
case
was
prejudged
and
we
were
denied
a
hearing
in
our
defence
the
inference
is
conveyed
in
article
that
indian
hostilities
on
the
plains
were
provoked
by
and
followed
after
the
sand
creek
massacre
we
who
were
so
unfortunate
as
to
be
citizens
of
colorado
at
the
time
know
that
a
very
great
majority
of
the
savage
atrocities
of
that
period
occurred
before
the
battle
of
sand
creek
we
know
that
the
sand
creek
indian
camp
was
the
common
rendezvous
of
the
hostile
bands
who
were
committing
those
atrocities
we
know
that
comparatively
few
occurred
afterward
no
amount
of
special
pleading
no
reiteration
of
partial
statements
and
withholding
of
more
important
truths
will
change
the
facts
so
well
known
to
the
earlier
settlers
of
colorado
i
deny
that
the
utes
have
either
bought
or
paid
for
any
land
they
have
relinquished
for
a
consideration
a
certain
portion
of
the
land
they
formerly
claimed
and
still
retain
the
other
portion
i
deny
also
that
only
twelve
of
the
white
river
utes
are
guilty
and
the
great
mass
of
them
innocent
the
contrary
is
the
fact

reply
to
the
assertion
that
the
perpetrators
of
the
sand
creek
massacre
were
denied
a
hearing
in

defence
i
wish
to
state
to
the
readers
of
that
in
addition
to
the
congressional
committees
from
whose
reports
i
have
already
quoted
there
was
appointed

to

that
massacre
this
commission
sat
days
in

at

colonel

called
before
it
in
his
defence
all
the
witnesses
he
chose
and
gave
notice
on
the
day
of
the
commission
sitting
that
he
did
not
wish
to
introduce
any
more
witnesses
for
the
defence
he
also
had
and
used
the
privilege
of
every
witness
called
by
the
commission
the
evidence
given
before
this
commission
occupies
over
two
hundred
pages
of

for
in
reply
to
the
assertion
that
a
great
majority
of
the
savage

of

occurred

at

that
comparatively

occurred

will
give
to
the
readers
of
one
extract
from
the
report
of
the
indian
peace
commission
of
alluding
to
the
sand

the
report
says
it
scarcely
has
its
parallel
in
the
records
of
indian
barbarity
fleeing
women
holding
up
their

for
mercy

shot
down

killed

a
manner
that
would
put
to
shame
the

no
one
will
be
astonished
that
a

ensued

cost

carried
conflagration

in

of

to

i
will
relate
one
more
incident
of
that
terrible
day
it
has
not
been
recorded
in
any
of
the
reports
it
was
told
in
colorado
to
one
of
the
members
of
the
senate
committee
at
the
time
of
their
investigation
one
of
the
squaws
had
escaped
from
the
village
and
was
crouching
behind
some
low
sage
brush
a
frightened
horse
came
running
toward
her
its
owner
in
hot
pursuit
seeing
that
the
horse
was
making
directly
for
her
shelter
and
that
she
would
inevitably
be
seen
and
thinking
that
possibly
if
she
caught
the
horse
and
gave
him
back
to
the
owner
she
might
thus
save
her
life
she
ran
after
the
horse
caught
it
and
stood
holding
it
till
the
soldier
came
up
remembering
that
with
her
blanket
rolled
tight
around
her
she
might
possibly
be
taken
for
a
man
as
she
put
into
the
soldier
hand
the
horse
bridle
with
the
other
hand
she
threw
open
her
blanket
enough
to
show
her
bosom
that
he
might
see
that
she
was
a
woman
he
put
the
muzzle
of
his
pistol
between
her
breasts
and
shot
her
dead
and
afterward
was
not
ashamed
to
boast
of
the
act
it
was
by
such
deeds
as
this
that
the

soldiers
acquitted
themselves
well

a
correspondence
which
was
held
with
the
secretary
of

interior
in
the
winter
of
in
regard
to
the
poncas
is
so
excellent
an
illustration
of
the
methods
and
policy
of
the

department
that
it
is
worth
while
to
give
it
at
length
here
first
letter
jackson
to
secretary
schurz
new
york
friday
the
secretary
of
the
dear
sir
have
received
from
a
boston
lady
a
letter
which
has
so
important
a
bearing
on
the
interests
of
the
poncas
that
i
take
the
liberty
of
asking
you
to
read
and
reply
to
the
following
extracts
i
send
them
to
you
with
the
writer
permission
in
boston
most
of
those
who
are
likely
to
give
most
largely
and
feel
most
strongly
for
the
indians
have
confidence
in
secretary
schurz
they
think
that
so
far
he
has
shown
himself
their
friend
and
they
feel
unprepared
to
help
any
plan
with
regard
to
the
indians
which
he
opposes
the
greatest
service
which
could
be
rendered
to
the
indian
cause
at
present
would
be
given
therefore
by
some
one
sufficiently
interested
to
obtain
an
answer
who
would
write
to
secretary
schurz
and
request
him
on
the
part
of
the
indians
either
to
aid
them
by
publicly
and
cordially
endorsing
this
effort
of
the
poncas
to
secure
their
legal
rights
in
the
courts
or
else
to
give
his
reasons
against
this
attempt
in
so
clear
a
form
that
one
could
understand
them
if
there
are
good
reasons
there
can
be
no
ground
for
keeping
them
secret
and
the
public
has
a
right
to
know
them
if
not
no
man
can
call
himself
a
friend
of
the
indians
who
throws
cold
water
on
the
present
interest
of
the
public
in
this
matter
secretary
schurz
has
already
stated
that
it
was
not
worth
while
to
sue
for
the
ponca
lands
as
the
poncas
are
better
off
where
they
now
are
but
secretary
schurz
can
not
deny
that
it
is
worth
ten
times
to
prove
that
if
the
government
seizes
land
given
to
the
indians
forever
by
solemn
compact
the
latter
can
by
the
courts
recover
it
secretary
schurz
has
also
said
that
a
bill
to
give
the
indians
land
in
severalty
is
already
before
congress
if
he
wishes
that
bill
to
pass
he
must
know
that
it
is
only
by
help
of
the
people
that
the
ignorance
apathy
and
greed
which
are
accountable
for
the
shameful
record
of
the
past
can
be
overcome
and
that
whatever
his
sentiments
toward
these
particular
poncas
he
can
not
afford
to
throw
aside
the
interest
they
have
excited
for
a
hundred
years
the
indians
have
been
the
victims
of
fraud
and
oppression
on
the
part
of
the
government
will
anything
put
an
end
to
it
but
to
give
the
indians
the
legal
right
to
protect
themselves
promises
and
plans
will
not
do
it
for
who
can
assure
their
performance
secretary
schurz
position
is
a
strange
one
and
the
public
are
waiting
and
watching
to
see
what
it
means
is
it
possible
that
he
is
satisfied
to
have
human
beings
with
valuable
possessions
however
uncivilized
held
as
absolute
slaves
with
no
rights
and
at
the
mercy
of
a
government
like
ours
whose
constant
changes
to
say
the
least
render
most
improbable
the
wise
equitable
and
humane
treatment
he
recommends
in
his
when
the
distance
of
the
indian
from
the
personal
interests
of
all
but
those
states
which
have
a
personal
interest
in
possessing
his
lands
makes
the
assistance
of
congress
in
such
treatment
still
more
unlikely
i
can
not
but
believe
that
he
has
allowed
himself
to
be
driven
into
an
opposition
he
does
not
really
feel
and
that
he
will
yet
have
the
magnanimity
to
forget
any
criticism
on
his
own
acts
and
take
the
lead
with
those
who
would
try
to
give
the
indians
a
permanent
defence
against
the
vicissitudes
of
party
and
the
greed
of
men
i
will
not
forget
to
add
that
if
the
three
thousand
and
odd
hundreds
of
dollars
needed
to
complete
the
ten
thousand
required
to
pay
the
costs
of
the
ponca
suits
can
not
be
raised
in
the
great
city
of
new
york
i
will
myself
guarantee
to
raise
it
in
boston
in
hours
if
secretary
schurz
will
openly
endorse
the
plan
the
matter
stands
therefore
in
this
shape
if
you
can
say
that
you
approve
of
the
poncas
bringing
the
suits
they
wish
to
bring
for
the
recovery
of
their
lands
all
the
money
for
which
they
ask
can
be
placed
in
their
hands
immediately
the
writer
of
the
above
letter
assured
me
that
she
would
herself
give
the
entire
sum
if
there
were
any
difficulty
in
raising
it
if
you
do
not
approve
of
the
poncas
bringing
these
suits
or
making
an
effort
to
bring
them
are
you
willing
to
give
the
reasons
of
your
disapproval
it
would
be
a
great
satisfaction
to
those
boston
friends
of
yours
whose
action
in
this
matter
turns
solely
on
your
decision
if
these
reasons
could
be
stated
in
clear
and
explicit
form
yours
respectfully
helen
jackson
secretary
schurz
to
jackson
department
of
the
interior
office
of
the
secretary
dear
madam
should
certainly
have
answered
your
letter
of
the
instant
more
promptly
had
i
not
been
somewhat
overburdened
with
official
business
during
the
past
week
i
hope
you
will
kindly
pardon
the
involuntary
delay
as
i
understand
the
matter
money
is
being
collected
for
the
purpose
of
engaging
counsel
to
appear
for
the
poncas
in
the
courts
of
the
united
states
partly
to
represent
them
in
the
case
of
an
appeal
from
judge
dundy
decision
and
partly
to
procure
a
decision
for
the
recovery
of
their
old
reservation
on
the
missouri
river
i
believe
that
the
collection
of
money
for
these
purposes
is
useless
an
appeal
from
judge
dundy
decision
can
proceed
only
from
the
government
not
from
the
poncas
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
decision
was
in
favor
of
the
latter
an
appeal
was
indeed
entered
by
the
united
states
at
omaha
immediately
after
the
decision
had
been
announced
some
time
ago
his
brief
was
submitted
to
me
on
examining
it
i
concluded
at
once
to
advise
the
of
my
opinion
that
it
should
be
dropped
as
i
could
not
approve
the
principles
upon
which
the
argument
was
based
the
consented
to
instruct
the
accordingly
and
thus
judge
decision
stands
without
further
question
on
the
part
of
the
government
had
an
appeal
been
prosecuted
and
had
judge
dundy
decision
been
sustained
by
the
court
above
the
general
principles
involved
in
it
would
simply
have
been
affirmed
without
any
other
practical
effect
than
that
already
obtained
this
matter
is
therefore
ended
as
to
the
right
of
the
poncas
to
their
old
reservation
on
the
missouri
the
supreme
court
has
repeatedly
decided
that
an
indian
tribe
can
not
sue
the
united
states
or
a
state
in
the
federal
courts
the
decisions
are
clear
and
uniform
on
this
point
among
lawyers
with
whom
i
discussed
this
matter
i
have
not
found
a
single
one
who
entertained
a
different
view
but
i
did
find
among
them
serious
doubts
as
to
whether
a
decision
even
if
the
poncas
could
bring
suits
would
be
in
their
favor
considering
the
facts
in
the
case
but
inasmuch
as
such
a
suit
can
not
be
brought
at
all
this
is
not
the
question
it
is
evidently
idle
to
collect
money
and
to
fee
attorneys
for
the
purpose
of
doing
a
thing
which
can
not
be
done
had
the
disinterested
friends
of
the
indians
who
are
engaged
in
this
work
first
consulted
lawyers
on
the
question
of
possibility
they
would
no
doubt
have
come
to
the
same
conclusion
the
study
i
have
given
to
the
indian
question
in
its
various
aspects
past
and
present
has
produced
in
my
mind
the
firm
conviction
that
the
only
certain
way
to
secure
the
indians
in
their
possessions
and
to
prevent
them
from
becoming
forever
a
race
of
homeless
paupers
and
vagabonds
is
to
transform
their
tribal
title
into
individual
title
inalienable
for
a
certain
period
in
other
words
to
settle
them
in
severalty
and
give
them
by
patent
an
individual
in
their
lands
then
they
will
hold
their
lands
by
the
same
title
by
which
white
men
hold
theirs
and
they
will
as
a
matter
of
course
have
the
same
standing
in
the
courts
and
the
same
legal
protection
of
their
property
as
long
as
they
hold
large
tracts
in
the
shape
of
reservations
only
small
parts
of
which
they
can
make
useful
to
themselves
and
to
others
the
whole
being
held
by
the
tribe
in
common
their
tenure
will
always
be
insecure
it
will
grow
more
and
more
so
as
our
population
increases
and
the
quantity
of
available
land
diminishes
we
may
call
this
an
ugly
and
deplorable
fact
but
it
is
a
fact
for
all
that
long
experience
shows
that
the
protests
of
good
people
in
the
name
of
justice
and
humanity
have
availed
but
very
little
against
this
tendency
and
it
is
useless
to
disguise
and
unwise
to
overlook
it
if
we
mean
to
do
a
real
service
to
the
indians
for
this
reason
i
attach
much
more
importance
to
the
passage
of
legislation
providing
for
the
settlement
of
the
indians
in
severalty
and
giving
them
individual
title
in
the
residue
of
their
lands
not
occupied
by
them
to
be
disposed
of
for
their
benefit
than
to
all
the
efforts
however
well
intended
to
procure
judicial
decisions
which
as
i
have
shown
can
not
be
had
i
am
glad
to
say
that
the
conversations
i
have
had
with
senators
and
representatives
in
congress
on
the
policy
of
settling
the
indians
in
severalty
have
greatly
encouraged
my
hope
of
the
success
of
the
severalty
bill
during
the
present
session
i
need
not
repeat
here
what
i
said
in
a
letter
to
edward
atkinson
which
you
may
possibly
have
seen
some
time
ago
in
the
boston
papers
about
the
necessity
of
educating
indian
children
you
undoubtedly
understand
that
as
well
as
i
do
and
i
hope
you
will
concur
in
my
recommendation
that
the
money
collected
for
taking
the
ponca
case
into
the
courts
which
is
impossible
of
accomplishment
and
as
much
more
as
can
be
added
be
devoted
to
the
support
and
enlargement
of
our
indian
schools
such
as
those
at
hampton
and
carlisle
thus
a
movement
which
undoubtedly
has
the
hearty
sympathy
of
many
good
men
and
women
but
which
at
present
seems
in
danger
of
being
wasted
on
the
unattainable
may
be
directed
into
a
practical
channel
and
confer
a
real
and
lasting
benefit
on
the
indian
race

thursday
carl
dear
sir
letter
of
the
instant
is
at
hand
if
i
understand
this
letter
correctly
the
position
which
you
take
is
as
follows
that
there
is
in
your
opinion
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
lawyers
whom
you
have
consulted
on
the
subject
no
way
of
bringing
before
the
courts
the
suits
for
the
prosecution
of
which
money
has
been
and
is
being
contributed
by
the
friends
of
the
poncas
that
the
reason
you
do
not
approve
of
this
movement
is
that
it
is
evidently
idle
to
collect
money
and
to
fee
attorneys
for
the
purpose
of
doing
a
thing
which
can
not
be
done
this
is
the
sole
reason
which
i
understand
you
to
give
for
discountenancing
the
collection
of
money
for
these
suits
am
i
correct
in
this
and
are
we
to
infer
that
it
is
on
this
ground
and
no
other
that
you
oppose
the
collection
of
money
for
this
purpose
are
we
to
understand
that
you
would
be
in
favor
of
the
poncas
recovering
their
lands
by
process
of
law
provided
it
were
practicable
you
say
also
that
you
hope
i
will
concur
in
your
recommendation
that
the
money
collected
for
taking
the
ponca
case
into
the
courts
shall
be
devoted
to
the
support
and
enlargement
of
our
indian
schools
may
i
ask
how
it
would
be
in
your
opinion
possible
to
take
money
given
by
thousands
of
people
for
one
specific
purpose
and
use
it
for
another
different
purpose
you
say
had
the
friends
of
the
indians
who
are
engaged
in
this
work
first
consulted
lawyers
on
the
question
of
possibility
they
would
no
doubt
have
come
to
the
same
conclusion
had
the
friends
of
the
indians
engaged
in
this
work
and
initiated
this
movement
without
having
consulted
lawyers
it
would
have
been
indeed
foolish
but
this
was
not
the
case
lawyers
of
skill
and
standing
were
found
ready
to
undertake
the
case
and
the
matter
stands
therefore
precisely
as
it
stood
when
i
wrote
to
you
on
the
instant
all
the
money
which
is
thought
to
be
needed
for
carrying
the
ponca
case
before
the
courts
can
be
raised
in
hours
in
boston
if
you
can
say
that
you
approve
of
the
suits
being
brought
if
your
only
objection
to
the
movement
is
the
one
objection
which
you
have
stated
namely
that
it
would
be
futile
can
you
not
say
that
if
lawyers
of
standing
are
ready
to
undertake
the
case
you
would
be
glad
to
see
the
attempt
made
in
the
courts
and
the
question
settled
if
it
is
as
you
think
a
futile
effort
it
will
be
shown
to
be
so
if
it
is
as
the
friends
and
lawyers
of
the
poncas
think
a
practicable
thing
a
great
wrong
will
be
righted
you
say
that
to
settle
them
the
indians
in
severalty
and
give
them
by
patent
an
individual
in
their
lands
will
enable
them
to
hold
their
lands
by
the
same
title
by
which
white
men
hold
theirs
and
that
then
they
will
as
a
matter
of
course
have
the
same
standing
in
the
courts
and
the
same
legal
protection
of
their
property
may
i
ask
you
if
any
bill
has
been
brought
before
congress
which
is
so
worded
as
to
secure
these
ends
my
only
apology
for
troubling
you
again
is
my
deep
interest
in
the
indians
and
in
the
ponca
case
especially
yours
truly
helen
jackson
reply
of
secretary
schurz
to
the
second
letter
washington
dear
madam
reply
to
your
letter
of
the
instant
i
beg
leave
to
say
that
if
an
indian
tribe
could
maintain
an
action
in
the
courts
of
the
united
states
to
assert
its
rights
i
should
object
to
it
just
as
little
as
i
would
object
to
the
exercise
of
the
same
privilege
on
the
part
of
white
men
what
i
do
object
to
is
the
collection
of
money
from
philanthropic
and
persons
ostensibly
for
the
benefit
of
the
indians
but
in
fact
for
the
benefit
of
attorneys
and
others
who
are
to
be
paid
for
again
testing
a
question
which
has
been
tested
more
than
once
and
has
been
decided
by
the
supreme
court
so
clearly
and
comprehensively
that
further
testing
seems
utterly
futile
you
say
that
there
are
lawyers
of
skill
and
standing
ready
to
undertake
the
case
of
course
there
are
such
you
can
find
lawyers
of
skill
and
standing
to
undertake
for
a
good
fee
any
case
however
hopeless
that
is
their
business
but
i
am
by
no
means
of
your
opinion
that
whether
it
be
futile
or
not
the
experiment
should
be
tried
once
more
and
for
this
purpose
the
collection
of
money
should
be
further
encouraged
it
can
not
be
said
in
this
case
that
if
the
attempt
will
not
help
it
will
not
hurt
there
seems
to
be
now
a
genuine
and
active
interest
in
the
indian
question
springing
up
many
sincere
friends
of
the
indian
are
willing
to
spend
time
and
money
for
the
promotion
of
their
welfare
such
a
movement
can
do
great
good
if
wisely
guided
in
the
direction
of
attainable
objects
but
if
it
be
so
conducted
that
it
can
result
only
in
putting
money
into
the
pockets
of
private
individuals
without
any
benefit
to
the
indians
the
collapse
will
be
as
hurtful
as
it
seems
to
be
inevitable
it
will
not
only
be
apt
to
end
a
movement
which
if
well
directed
might
have
become
very
useful
but
it
will
also
deter
the
sincere
friends
of
the
indians
who
contributed
their
means
in
the
hope
of
accomplishing
something
from
further
efforts
of
that
kind
so
that
we
may
find
it
very
difficult
for
a
long
time
at
least
to
engage
this
active
sympathy
again
confidence
once
abused
does
not
revive
very
quickly
this
is
my
view
of
the
case
you
ask
me
how
it
would
be
possible
to
take
money
given
by
thousands
of
people
for
one
specific
purpose
and
use
it
for
another
and
different
purpose
meaning
the
support
of
indian
schools
it
would
in
my
opinion
be
far
better
to
lay
the
matter
in
its
true
aspect
frankly
before
the
contributors
and
to
ask
them
for
their
consent
to
the
change
of
purpose
than
to
throw
away
the
money
for
a
purpose
which
can
not
be
accomplished
in
reply
to
your
inquiry
whether
any
bill
has
been
brought
before
congress
providing
for
the
settlement
of
the
indians
in
severalty
and
for
conferring
upon
the
individual
title
in
to
the
lands
allotted
to
them
i
am
glad
to
say
that
several
bills
of
this
kind
have
been
introduced
in
both
the
senate
and
the
house
and
are
now
before
the
respective
committees
on
indian
affairs
for
consideration
if
such
a
bill
passes
of
which
there
is
great
hope
the
indian
having
a
fee
title
by
patent
to
the
piece
of
land
which
he
individually
not
as
a
member
of
a
tribe
holds
as
his
own
will
stand
in
the
eye
of
the
law
just
like
any
other
owner
of
property
in
his
individual
right
and
as
a
matter
of
course
will
have
the
same
standing
in
court
this
will
do
more
in
securing
the
indian
in
the
practical
enjoyment
of
his
property
than
anything
else
i
can
think
of
and
it
has
long
been
my
endeavor
to
bring
about
just
this
result
i
trust
we
shall
obtain
the
desired
legislation
during
the
present
session
of
congress
very
respectfully
yours
schurz
helen
jackson
new
york
the
evasive
and
inconclusive
character
of
these
replies
of
the
secretary
provoked
much
comment
and
gave
rise
to
a
very
and
natural
impression
that
he
was
for
some
reason
or
other
averse
to
the
restoration
to
the
poncas
of
their
old
homes
the
letters
were
reviewed
by
one
of
the
editors
of
the
york
in
a
paper
so
admirable
that
the
letters
ought
not
to
be
printed
without
it
civil
rights
in
acres
from
the
york
february
as
most
of
the
readers
of
the
already
know
friends
of
the
ponca
indians
are
endeavoring
to
have
the
tribe
restored
to
their
old
reservation
in
dakota
or
more
strictly
speaking
it
is
proposed
that
their
reservation
shall
be
restored
to
them
the
lands
occupied
by
the
poncas
were
ceded
to
them
by
the
united
states
by
solemn
treaty
by
a
cruel
and
wicked
blunder
which
no
man
has
attempted
to
explain
those
lands
were
ceded
to
the
sioux
but
the
sioux
did
not
want
the
lands
and
they
have
never
occupied
them
unto
this
day
to
this
robbery
of
the
tribe
was
added
the
destruction
of
their
houses
movable
property
and
farms
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
would
have
redress
in
the
courts
for
such
an
outrage
as
this
an
indian
has
no
legal
status
he
is
merely
a
live
and
particularly
troublesome
animal
in
the
eye
of
the
law
but
while
the
poncas
were
trying
to
get
back
on
their
lands
they
were
arrested
by
order
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
on
the
charge
of
running
away
from
the
agency
to
which
they
had
been
sent
by
the
government
when
their
lands
were
taken
from
them
it
is
not
necessary
to
add
words
to
intensify
this
accumulation
of
criminal
folly
and
wrong
certain
citizens
of
nebraska
hearing
of
the
injustice
which
was
being
perpetrated
on
the
poncas
raised
funds
and
had
the
chiefs
brought
before
united
states
district
judge
dundy
on
a
writ
of
to
inquire
why
they
were
thus
restrained
of
their
liberty
judge
dundy
decided
that
an
indian
was
person
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
and
that
these
persons
were
unlawfully
held
in
duress
it
was
thought
that
the
united
states
would
appeal
from
this
dictum
but
no
appeal
was
taken
much
to
the
disappointment
of
the
friends
of
the
indians
as
it
was
hoped
that
a
decision
could
be
reached
to
show
whether
the
indian
was
or
was
not
so
far
clothed
with
the
privilege
of
a
citizen
that
he
could
have
a
standing
in
the
courts
of
law
accordingly
the
and
philanthropic
persons
who
had
espoused
the
cause
of
the
poncas
resolved
to
make
up
a
case
which
carried
to
the
united
states
supreme
court
should
determine
once
and
forever
this
moot
point
to
this
end
money
has
been
raised
by
subscription
by
special
gift
and
by
contributions
taken
at
public
meetings
in
various
parts
of
the
country
a
lady
residing
in
boston
moved
by
the
pitiful
condition
of
the
indians
who
tried
to
struggle
toward
civilization
offered
to
supply
all
the
money
which
was
lacking
toward
the
expenses
of
the
suit
provided
secretary
schurz
would
give
some
public
assurances
that
he
favored
this
manner
of
determining
the
case
or
would
give
his
reasons
against
this
attempt
the
lady
proposition
was
sent
to
helen
hunt
jackson
whose
disinterested
and
efficient
labors
in
behalf
of
the
poncas
had
already
attracted
attention
jackson
forwarded
to
secretary
schurz
the
whole
statement
thereupon
an
interesting
correspondence
ensued
this
correspondence
has
been
printed
in
the
boston
papers
presumably
by
direction
of
secretary
schurz
in
reply
to
the
request
to
say
whether
he
approves
of
the
movement
to
carry
the
ponca
case
to
the
supreme
court
in
order
that
the
tribe
may
recover
their
old
reservation
the
secretary
says
that
this
would
be
useless
as
the
courts
have
repeatedly
decided
that
an
indian
tribe
can
not
sue
the
united
states
unfortunately
schurz
does
not
cite
these
cases
but
we
must
take
it
for
granted
that
he
knows
what
he
is
talking
about
he
adds
that
he
has
taken
the
advice
of
lawyers
who
coincide
with
him
in
this
opinion
as
a
suit
can
not
be
brought
at
all
according
to
the
secretary
and
his
legal
advisers
it
would
be
idle
to
collect
money
for
this
purpose
and
the
secretary
suggests
that
if
the
disinterested
friends
of
the
indians
had
consulted
lawyers
before
they
began
their
work
they
would
be
of
his
opinion
as
to
the
futility
of
the
attempt
this
of
course
leaves
the
impression
that
the
secretary
withholds
his
approval
of
the
movement
to
secure
legal
rights
for
the
poncas
though
he
does
not
say
so
in
express
terms
his
reason
for
not
approving
the
attempt
is
that
it
will
do
no
good
his
solution
to
the
indian
problem
as
it
is
vaguely
called
is
to
settle
the
indians
in
severalty
breaking
up
their
tribal
organization
and
giving
to
each
individual
his
lands
in
this
the
secretary
thinks
will
enable
them
to
hold
their
lands
by
the
same
title
as
that
by
which
white
men
hold
theirs
and
a
matter
of
course
they
will
have
the
same
standing
in
the
courts
as
white
men
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
the
secretary
did
not
pause
here
long
enough
to
show
how
the
giving
to
an
indian
of
acres
of
land
can
clothe
him
with
civil
rights
which
he
does
not
now
possess
and
which
the
secretary
thinks
that
the
courts
can
not
give
him
for
this
reason
however
schurz
is
greatly
in
favor
of
legislation
providing
for
the
settlement
of
the
indians
in
severalty
various
bills
to
accomplish
which
he
says
are
in
preparation
as
for
the
money
raised
already
the
secretary
suggests
that
since
in
his
opinion
it
would
be
misspent
in
obtaining
judicial
decision
it
might
be
used
in
the
education
of
indian
children
replying
to
this
jackson
asks
if
the
secretary
would
be
in
favor
of
the
poncas
recovering
their
lands
by
process
of
law
provided
that
could
be
done
to
this
direct
and
very
important
inquiry
we
regret
to
notice
that
the
secretary
finds
himself
unable
to
reply
although
in
a
letter
immediately
following
this
he
does
say
that
if
an
indian
tribe
could
maintain
an
action
at
law
in
the
courts
to
assert
its
rights
he
would
no
more
object
to
it
than
he
would
to
a
white
man
doing
the
same
thing
as
to
the
suggestion
that
the
money
collected
for
the
expenses
of
legal
proceedings
be
used
for
educational
purposes
jackson
asks
the
secretary
how
it
would
be
possible
to
take
money
given
for
one
specific
purpose
and
use
it
for
another
and
wholly
different
purpose
schurz
rejoins
that
the
consent
of
the
donors
may
first
be
obtained
but
he
forgets
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
canvass
the
country
to
ascertain
the
wishes
of
thousands
of
unknown
givers
to
this
fund
referring
to
the
intimation
that
the
friends
of
the
indians
had
not
taken
legal
counsel
in
this
matter
and
that
the
secretary
had
jackson
observes
that
they
did
take
such
counsel
and
that
an
omission
to
do
so
would
have
been
indeed
foolish
it
will
be
observed
that
the
secretary
objection
to
the
attempt
to
secure
civil
rights
is
its
futility
and
in
answer
to
statement
that
the
friends
of
the
indians
have
sought
the
opinions
of
lawyers
in
this
case
he
replies
that
one
find
lawyers
of
skill
and
standing
to
undertake
for
a
good
fee
any
case
however
hopeless
to
those
who
might
think
that
this
is
unjustly
severe
on
the
legal
profession
it
should
be
said
that
schurz
has
been
by
profession
a
lawyer
and
should
know
what
he
is
talking
about
and
we
must
presume
that
schurz
profound
knowledge
of
the
law
which
is
fortified
by
the
opinions
of
eminent
legal
men
induces
him
to
consider
the
whole
case
closed
in
advance
of
its
submission
to
the
courts
it
would
be
interesting
however
to
know
if
the
secretary
lawyers
of
skill
and
standing
are
less
easily
influenced
by
the
prospect
of
a
fee
than
the
lawyers
of
skill
and
standing
consulted
by
the
friends
of
the
poncas
the
exceedingly
able
opinion
of
secretary
schurz
we
find
is
that
it
is
useless
to
give
the
indian
a
standing
in
the
courts
through
judicial
decisions
as
he
can
readily
secure
this
by
accepting
from
the
government
of
the
united
states
a
deed
of
acres
of
land
condition
of
the
poncas
in
the
summer
of
standing
bear
and
his
party
after
their
release
by
the
decision
of
judge
dundy
settled
on
an
island
in
the
niobrara
river
which
was
a
part
of
their
old
reservation
and
had
fortunately
been
overlooked
when
the
united
states
government
took
forcible
possession
of
the
rest
of
their
land
and
presented
it
to
the
sioux
here
they
were
joined
by
other
fugitives
of
their
tribe
till
the
number
reached
about
one
hundred
and
thirty
a
committee
which
had
been
organized
in
omaha
for
their
relief
supplied
them
with
farming
implements
and
they
went
industriously
to
work
this
committee
published
in
july
a
report
containing
the
following
paragraphs
we
consider
the
treatment
of
the
ponca
indians
as
one
of
the
most
chapters
in
our
national
record
of
indian
wrongs
and
we
are
determined
to
spare
no
effort
to
restore
to
them
their
stolen
homes
and
rights
and
to
relieve
the
american
people
of
the
stigma
of
this
terrible
wrong
the
senate
of
the
united
states
during
the
past
winter
appointed
a
select
committee
ascertain
and
report
the
circumstances
of
the
removal
of
the
ponca
indians
from
their
reservation
and
whether
the
said
indians
are
not
entitled
to
be
restored
thereto
this
senate
committee
devoted
a
long
time
to
a
thorough
and
patient
investigation
of
this
whole
ponca
case
and
reported
that
the
poncas
had
been
without
authority
of
law
from
their
homes
to
the
indian
territory
and
reported
also
a
bill
for
their
restoration
to
their
former
reservation
and
recommending
be
appropriated
for
the
purpose
of
taking
the
poncas
back
and
restoring
their
now
dilapidated
homes
this
able
report
of
the
united
states
senate
says
that
dealing
with
one
of
the
most
peaceable
and
orderly
and
of
all
the
tribes
of
indians
the
government
has
violated
in
the
most
flagrant
manner
their
rights
of
property
and
disregarded
their
appeals
to
the
honor
and
justice
of
the
united
states
and
the
dictates
of
humanity
the
report
also
says
that
the
committee
can
find
no
language
sufficiently
strong
to
condemn
the
whole
proceeding
and
trace
to
it
all
the
troubles
which
have
come
upon
the
poncas
and
the
hardships
and
sufferings
which
have
followed
them
since
they
were
taken
from
their
old
reservation
and
placed
in
their
present
position
in
the
indian
territory
the
omaha
ponca
relief
committee
need
no
better
vindication
of
their
action
in
behalf
of
this
distressed
and
outraged
people
than
these
strong
and
weighty
words
of
a
committee
of
united
states
senators
composed
of
representative
men
of
both
political
parties
the
omaha
committee
consisted
of
bishop
clarkson
of
nebraska
chairman
rev
sherrill
rev
harsha
leavitt
burnham
yates
and
perine
at
the
request
of
this
committee
tibbles
in
june
went
to
the
indian
territory
to
visit
the
poncas
of
whom
only
about
were
left
alive
he
was
authorized
to
assure
them
of
the
interest
and
efforts
of
humane
people
all
over
the
country
in
their
behalf
and
to
notify
them
that
the
omaha
committee
were
ready
to
assist
them
in
any
practical
way
to
return
to
their
old
homes
from
which
they
had
been
unjustly
and
inhumanly
ejected
tibbles
succeeded
in
visiting
the
poncas
although
the
government
agent
interfered
with
him
in
many
ways
and
finally
arrested
him
by
authority
of
an
order
from
washington
to
arrest
any
member
of
the
omaha
committee
who
came
upon
the
reservation
he
was
insulted
by
the
agent
taken
by
force
out
of
the
reservation
and
threatened
with
much
more
severe
treatment
if
he
ever
returned
this
outrage
on
a
free
citizen
of
the
united
states
aroused
indignation
throughout
the
country
the
comments
of
the
press
on
the
occurrence
showed
that
people
were
at
last
waking
up
to
a
sense
of
the
tyrannical
injustice
of
the
indian
department
the
york
said
editorially
the
indian
department
may
as
well
understand
at
once
that
the
ponca
case
has
passed
out
of
their
control
it
is
a
matter
of
simple
justice
which
the
people
are
determined
to
see
righted
no
petty
indian
agent
has
the
legal
right
to
imprison
maltreat
and
threaten
the
life
of
any
citizen
totally
guiltless
of
offence
beyond
that
of
working
to
give
these
serfs
of
the
government
the
standing
of
human
beings
it
is
the
government
of
this
great
republic
where
all
men
are
free
and
equal
that
holds
these
poncas
prisoners
on
a
tract
where
to
remain
is
death
they
are
innocent
of
any
crime
except
that
they
have
been
robbed
of
their
land
and
that
they
ask
to
bring
suit
as
a
black
man
or
convict
could
do
in
the
courts
for
its
recovery
tibbles
reported
the
condition
of
the
poncas
in
indian
territory
as
deplorable
in
the
extreme
they
live
in
constant
dread
and
fear
and
are
as
much
imprisoned
as
if
they
were
in
a
penitentiary
they
seem
to
have
lost
all
hope
are
and
disconsolate
with
one
or
two
exceptions
they
are
making
no
effort
to
help
themselves
their
farms
are
miserable
little
patches
to
which
they
pay
very
little
attention
one
of
them
said
to
me
the
government
forces
me
to
stay
here
it
can
feed
me
i
had
a
good
farm
back
at
our
old
home
and
if
i
was
back
there
i
would
farm
again
i
have
no
heart
to
work
here
the
one
hundred
and
fifteen
who
are
back
on
the
old
reservation
have
a
much
larger
amount
of
land
under
cultivation
than
the
whole
four
hundred
who
are
in
indian
territory
they
have
kept
their
crops
in
good
condition
and
are
full
of
energy
and
hope
the
government
agency
for
the
poncas
having
been
transferred
to
the
indian
territory
the
annuities
due
the
tribe
were
of
course
paid
there
and
that
portion
of
the
tribe
which
had
fled
back
to
dakota
received
nothing
moreover
the
indian
bureau
issued
an
order
forbidding
any
ponca
who
should
leave
the
indian
territory
to
take
with
him
any
kind
of
property
whatsoever
under
penalty
of
being
arrested
for
stealing
as
they
could
not
take
their
families
on
the
long
hard
journey
to
dakota
without
food
or
means
of
transportation
this
order
kept
them
imprisoned
in
indian
territory
as
effectually
as
a
military
guard
could
have
done
the
government
employés
in
charge
of
them
reported
meanwhile
that
they
had
made
up
their
minds
to
live
and
die
where
they
are
there
exists
a
feeling
of
contentment
in
the
tribe
that
will
make
it
very
difficult
for
any
one
to
induce
them
to
leave
their
present
home
says
a
general
press
despatch
presumably
dictated
by
the
indian
bureau
and
sent
throughout
the
country
on
july
it
seems
an
insult
to
people
to
suppose
that
this
statement
would
be
believed
close
on
the
heels
of
the
general
order
for
the
arrest
of
all
fleeing
poncas
who
should
dare
to
take
with
them
out
of
the
indian
territory
one
dollar
worth
of
property
a
very
superfluous
piece
of
legislation
surely
for
a
community
so
contented
that
it
would
be
difficult
for
any
one
to
induce
them
to
leave
their
homes
the
legal
aspect
of
the
case
the
chivalric
and
disinterested
attorneys
who
had
had
the
charge
of
the
ponca
case
from
the
outset
were
not
to
be
intimidated
by
the
threats
nor
outwitted
by
the
expedients
of
the
indian
bureau
the
ingenious
devices
practised
by
the
department
of
the
interior
to
hinder
the
getting
service
of
summons
upon
the
defendants
in
the
suits
necessary
to
recover
the
poncas
lands
make
by
themselves
a
shameful
chapter
which
will
some
day
be
written
out
but
on
the
of
july
the
attorneys
were
able
to
report
to
the
omaha
committee

great
delay
was
made
necessary
in
the
commencement
of
these
cases
and
the
ones
subsequently
commenced
in

of
which
we
below
make
mention
owing

iii
testimonies
to
indian
character
early
in
the
governor
of
the
territory
in
his
message
to
the
assembly
invited
their
attention
to
the
condition
of
the
indians
he
observed
that
irrespective
of
the
principles
of
religion
and
justice
it
was
the
interest
and
should
be
the
policy
of
the
united
states
to
be
at
peace
with
them
but
that
could
not
continue
to
be
the
case
if
the
treaties
existing
between
them
and
the
government
were
broken
with
impunity
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
territory
he
referred
to
the
fact
that
while
the
white
men
loudly
complained
of
every
injury
committed
by
the
indians
however
trifling
and
demanded
immediate
reparation
they
were
daily
perpetrating
against
them
injuries
and
wrongs
of
the
most
provoking
and
atrocious
nature
for
which
the
perpetrators
had
not
been
brought
to
justice
he
stated
that
the
number
of
those
unfortunate
people
who
had
been
murdered
since
the
peace
of
greenville
was
sufficient
to
produce
serious
alarm
for
the
consequences
he
added
further
that
a
late
attempt
to
bring
to
punishment
a
white
man
who
was
clearly
proved
to
have
killed
two
adult
indians
and
wounded
two
of
their
children
had
proved
abortive
on
character
of
indians
among
other
falsehoods
it
has
been
asserted
confidently
but
without
a
shadow
of
argument
or
fact
to
sustain
the
assertion
that
they
can
not
be
brought
to
a
state
of
civilization
or
be
induced
to
form
communities
and
engage
in
the
pursuits
of
agriculture
and
the
arts
in
consequence
of
some
physical
difference
between
them
and
the
race
this
hypothesis
is
contradicted
by
experience
which
has
abundantly
shown
that
the
two
races
when
placed
in
the
same
situation
and
acted
upon
by
the
same
causes
have
invariably
resorted
to
the
same
expedients
and
pursued
the
same
policy
this
averment
is
sustained
by
a
reference
to
the
white
people
who
have
been
taken
prisoners
in
childhood
and
brought
up
among
the
indians
in
every
such
case
the
child
of
civilization
has
become
the
ferocious
adult
of
the
forest
manifesting
all
the
peculiarities
tastes
and
preferences
of
the
native
indian
his
manners
habits
propensities
and
pursuits
have
been
the
same
so
that
the
most
astute
philosophical
observer
has
not
been
able
to
discover
any
difference
between
them
except
in
the
color
of
the
skin
and
in
some
instances
even
this
has
been
removed
by
long
exposure
to
the
elements
and
the
free
use
of
oils
and
paints
the
many
instances
which
there
are
on
record
of
cases
in
which
persons
taken
captive
by
the
indians
while
young
have
utterly
refused
in
later
life
to
return
to
their
relatives
and
homes
go
to
confirm
this
statement
of
judge
burnet
on
the
other
hand
he
says
the
attempts
that
have
been
made
at
different
times
to
improve
the
minds
and
cultivate
the
morals
of
these
people
have
always
been
attended
by
success
on
an
unprejudiced
comparison
between
the
civilized
educated
white
man
and
the
civilized
educated
indian
all
this
theory
of
an
organic
constitutional
difference
between
the
european
and
the
native
indian
vanishes
in
what
respect
have
ross
boudinot
hicks
ridge
and
others
differed
from
the
educated
men
of
our
own
race
inasmuch
then
as
the
reclaimed
educated
indian
becomes
assimilated
to
the
white
man
and
the
european
brought
up
from
infancy
among
the
indians
becomes
identified
with
them
this
alleged
difference
can
not
be
real
it
must
be
imaginary
the
fact
is
the
difficulty
of
civilizing
the
natives
of
this
continent
is
neither
greater
nor
less
than
that
which
retarded
the
improvement
of
the
barbarous
nations
of
europe
two
thousand
years
ago
men
uncivilized
have
always
delighted
in
the
chase
and
had
a
propensity
to
roam
both
history
and
experience
prove
that
nothing
but
necessity
arising
from
such
an
increase
of
population
as
destroys
the
game
has
ever
induced
men
to
settle
in
communities
and
rely
on
the
cultivation
of
the
earth
for
subsistence
in
the
progress
of
civilization
the
chase
has
given
way
to
the
pastoral
state
and
that
has
yielded
to
agriculture
as
the
increase
of
numbers
has
rendered
it
necessary
as
soon
as
the
cherokees
and
the
wyandots
were
surrounded
by
a
white
population
and
their
territory
was
so
contracted
as
to
cut
off
their
dependence
on
hunting
and
fishing
they
became
farmers
and
manifested
a
strong
desire
to
cultivate
the
arts
and
this
would
have
been
the
choice
of
the
whole
indian
race
if
the
policy
of
the
government
had
permitted
it
it
is
not
just
to
consider
the
natives
of
this
country
as
a
distinct
and
inferior
race
because
they
do
not
generally
imitate
us
when
we
not
only
remove
every
consideration
that
could
induce
them
to
do
so
but
in
fact
render
it
impossible
what
motive
of
ambition
was
there
to
stimulate
them
to
effort
when
they
were
made
to
feel
that
they
held
their
country
as

the
covetous
eye
of
the
white
man
was
fixed
on

they
received
the
chilling
notice
that
they

at

of

they
ceded
to
the
american

large
and
valuable
portions
of
the
country
at
nominal
prices
those
lands
were
rapidly
settled
by
americans
in
whose
purity
and
friendship
the
unsuspecting
natives
had
great
confidence
nor
did
they
awake
from
that
delusion
till
their
habits
of
sobriety
and
morality
had
been
undermined
and
the
vices
engendered
by
intemperance
and
idleness
had
contaminated
every
tribe
their
subsistence
became
precarious
their
health
declined
their
their
dignity
of
character
and
the
heroism
inherited
from
their
ancestors
were
lost
they
became
in
their
own
estimation
a
degraded
dependent
race
the
government
availing
itself
of
their
weakness
and
want
of
energy
succeeded
by
bribes
and
menaces
in
obtaining
the
best
portions
of
their
country
and
eventually
in
driving
them
from
the
land
of
their
birth
to
a
distant
home
in
an
unknown
region
this
distressing
chapter
of
aboriginal
history
began
at

the

most
scrupulous
degree
in
their
intercourse
with
the
white

simply
to
call
these
people

would
convey
but
a
faint
idea
of
the
deep
hue
of
piety
and
devotion
which
pervades
the
whole
of
their
conduct
their
honesty
is
immaculate
and
their
purity
of

and
their
observance
of
the
rites
of
their
religion
are
most
uniform
and
remarkable
they
are
certainly
more

bonneville
irving
i
fearlessly
assert
to
the
world
and
i
defy
contradiction
that
the
north
american
indian
is
everywhere
in
his
native
state
a
highly
moral
and
religious
being
endowed
by
his
maker
with
an
intuitive
knowledge
of
some
great
author
of
his
being
and
the
dread
of
whose
displeasure
he
constantly
lives
with
the
apprehension
before
him
of
a
future
state
when
he
expects
to
be
rewarded
or
punished
according
to
the
merits
he
has
gained
or
forfeited
in
this
world
i
never
saw
any
other
people
who
spend
so
much
of
their
lives
in
humbling
themselves
before
and
worshipping
the
great
spirit
as
these
tribes
do
nor
any
whom
i
would
not
as
soon
suspect
of
insincerity
and
hypocrisy
and
and
almost
are
continual
modes
of
appealing
to
the
great
spirit
for
his
countenance
and
forgiveness
to
each
other
i
have
found
these
people
kind
and
honorable
and
endowed
with
every
feeling
of
parental
filial
and
conjugal
affection
that
is
met
with
in
more
enlightened
communities
american
catlin
spent
eight
years
among
the
indians
more
than
forty
years
ago
he
travelled
among
the
wildest
of
them
lived
with
them
in
the
freest
intimacy
and
this
is
his
verdict
as
to
their
native
traits
when
uncontaminated
by
white
men
and
whiskey
as
long
ago
as
the
jesuit
father
lafitau
wrote
of
the
indians
and
stated
that
to
his
own
experience
he
added
that
of
father
garnier
who
had
lived
sixty
years
among
them
they
are
possessed
says
he
of
sound
judgment
lively
imagination
ready
conception
and
wonderful
memory
all
the
tribes
retain
at
least
some
trace
of
an
ancient
religion
handed
down
to
them
from
their
ancestors
and
a
form
of
government
they
reflect
justly
upon
their
affairs
and
better
than
the
mass
of
the
people
among
ourselves
they
prosecute
their
ends
by
sure
means
they
evince
a
degree
of
coolness
and
composure
which
would
exceed
our
patience
they
never
permit
themselves
to
indulge
in
passion
but
always
from
a
sense
of
honor
and
greatness
of
soul
appear
masters
of
themselves
they
are
and
proud
possess
a
courage
equal
to
every
trial
an
intrepid
valor
the
most
heroic
constancy
under
torments
and
an
equanimity
which
neither
misfortunes
nor
reverses
can
shake
toward
each
other
they
behave
with
a
natural
politeness
and
attention
entertaining
a
high
respect
for
the
aged
and
a
consideration
for
their
equals
which
appears
scarcely
reconcilable
with
that
freedom
and
independence
of
which
they
are
so
jealous
they
make
few
professions
of
kindness
but
yet
are
affable
and
generous
toward
strangers
and
the
unfortunate
they
exercise
a
degree
of
hospitality
and
charity
which
might
put
the
inhabitants
of
europe
to
the
blush
father
lafitau
does
not
disguise
the
fact
that
the
indians
have
great
faults
he
says
they
are
suspicious
and
vindictive
cruel
to
their
enemies
père
lallemant
a
missionary
among
the
hurons
says
in
point
of
intellect
they
are
not
at
all
inferior
to
the
natives
of
europe
i
could
not
have
believed
that
without
instruction
nature
could
have
produced
such
ready
and
vigorous
eloquence
or
such
a
sound
judgment
in
their
affairs
as
that
which
i
have
so
much
admired
among
the
hurons
i
admit
that
their
habits
and
customs
are
barbarous
in
a
thousand
ways
but
after
all
in
matters
which
they
consider
as
wrong
and
which
their
public
condemns
we
observe
among
them
less
criminality
than
in
france
although
here
the
only
punishment
of
a
crime
is
the
shame
of
having
committed
it
in
a
history
of
new
france
published
in
it
is
stated
of
the
indians
that
they
are
valorous
faithful
generous
and
humane
their
hospitality
is
so
great
that
they
extend
it
to
every
one
who
is
not
their
enemy
they
speak
with
much
judgment
and
reason
and
when
they
have
any
important
enterprise
to
undertake
the
chief
is
attentively
listened
to
for
two
or
three
hours
together
and
he
is
answered
point
to
point
as
the
subject
may
require
in
the
jesuit
missionaries
among
the
iroquois
reported
among
many
faults
caused
by
their
blindness
and
barbarous
education
we
meet
with
virtues
enough
to
cause
shame
among
the
most
of
christians
hospitals
for
the
poor
would
be
useless
among
them
because
there
are
no
beggars
those
who
have
are
so
liberal
to
those
who
are
in
want
that
everything
is
enjoyed
in
common
the
whole
village
must
be
in
distress
before
any
individual
is
left
in
necessity
captain
carver
who
travelled
in
among
the
wildest
tribes
describes
them
as
cruel
barbarous
and
revengeful
in
war
persevering
and
inflexible
in
pursuit
of
an
enemy
sanguinary
in
their
treatment
of
prisoners
and
sparing
neither
age
nor
sex
on
the
other
hand
he
found
them
temperate
in
their
mode
of
living
patient
of
hunger
and
fatigue
sociable
and
humane
to
all
whom
they
looked
on
as
friends
and
ready
to
share
with
them
the
last
morsel
of
food
they
possessed
or
to
expose
their
lives
in
their
defence
in
their
public
character
he
describes
them
as
possessing
an
attachment
to
their
nation
unknown
to
the
inhabitants
of
any
other
country
combining
as
if
actuated
by
one
soul
against
a
common
enemy
never
swayed
in
their
councils
by
selfish
or
party
views
but
sacrificing
everything
to
the
honor
and
advantage
of
their
tribe
in
support
of
which
they
fear
no
danger
and
are
affected
by
no
sufferings
they
are
not
only
affectionately
attached
indeed
to
their
own
offspring
but
are
extremely
fond
of
children
in
general
they
instruct
them
carefully
in
their
own
principles
and
train
them
up
with
attention
in
the
maxims
and
habits
of
their
nation
their
system
consists
chiefly
in
the
influence
of
example
and
impressing
on
them
the
traditionary
histories
of
their
ancestors
when
the
children
act
wrong
their
parents
remonstrate
and
reprimand
but
never
chastise
them
hist
the
very
idea
of
corporal
punishment
of
little
children
seems
to
have
been
peculiarly
obnoxious
to
the
native
north
american
in
the
relation
de
nouvelle
france
published
in
there
is
a
curious
story
of
an
incident
which
took
place
at
quebec
a
party
of
indians
watching
a
french
beat
his
drum
pressed
more
closely
around
him
than
he
liked
and
he
struck
one
of
the
indians
in
the
face
with
his
so
sharply
that
the
blow
drew
blood
the
indians
much
offended
went
to
the
interpreter
and
demanded
apologies
and
a
present
according
to
their
custom
no
said
the
interpreter
our
custom
is
to
punish
the
offender
we
will
punish
the
boy
in
your
presence
when
the
indians
saw
the
child
stripped
for
the
flogging
they
began
immediately
to
beg
for
his
pardon
but
as
the
soldiers
continued
their
preparations
for
whipping
the
lad
one
of
the
indians
suddenly
stripped
himself
and
threw
his
robe
over
the
boy
crying
out
scourge
me
if
you
choose
but
do
not
strike
the
boy
the
good
father
le
jeune
who
tells
this
story
adds
that
this
unwillingness
of
the
indians
to
see
any
child
chastised
will
probably
occasion
trouble
to
us
in
the
design
we
have
to
instruct
their
youth
as
far
back
as
we
find
evidence
that
the
indians
were
not
without
religion
thomas
hariot
an
employé
of
sir
walter
raleigh
writing
from
the
virginia
colony
says
of
the
virginia
indians
theye
beleeve
that
there
are
many
gods
which
theye
call
mantaoc
but
of
different
sorts
and
degrees
one
onely
chief
and
great
god
which
hath
been
from
all
eternitie
who
as
theye
affirme
when
hee
proposed
to
make
the
world
made
first
other
gods
of
a
principall
order
to
bee
as
means
and
instruments
to
bee

folow
and
after
the
sunne
moone
and
starres
as
pettie
gods
and
the
instruments
of
the
other
order
more
principall
in
general
says
hunter
a
day
seldom
passes
with
an
elderly
indian
or
others
who
are
esteemed
wise
and
good
in
which
a
blessing
is
not
asked
or
thanks
returned
to
the
giver
of
life
sometimes
audibly
but
more
generally
in
the
devotional
language
of
the
heart
all
the
employés
of
the
fur
company
bear
the
same
testimony
to
the
fidelity
and
honesty
of
the
indians
general
sibley
once
said
to
bishop
whipple
that
for
thirty
years
it
had
been
the
uniform
boast
of
the
sioux
in
every
council
that
they
had
never
taken
the
life
of
a
white
man
iv
outrages
committed
on
indians
by
whites
in
captain
bonneville
narrative
of
five
years
spent
in
the
rocky
mountains
are
many
instances
of
cruel
outrages
committed
by
whites
upon
indians
one
morning
one
of
his
trappers
discovering
that
his
traps
had
been
carried
off
in
the
night
took
a
horrid
oath
that
he
would
kill
the
first
indian
he
should
meet
innocent
or
guilty
as
he
was
returning
with
his
comrades
to
camp
he
beheld
two
unfortunate
root
diggers
seated
on
the
bank
fishing
advancing
upon
them
he
levelled
his
rifle
shot
one
on
the
spot
and
flung
his
bleeding
body
into
the
stream
a
short
time
afterward
when
this
party
of
trappers
were
about
to
cross
ogden
river
a
great
number
of
shoshokies
or
root
diggers
were
posted
on
the
opposite
bank
when
they
imagined
they
were
there
with
hostile
intent
they
advanced
upon
them
levelled
their
rifles
and
killed
of
them
on
the
spot
the
rest
fled
to
a
short
distance
then
halted
and
turned
about
howling
and
whining
like
wolves
and
uttering
most
piteous
wailings
the
trappers
chased
them
in
every
direction
the
poor
wretches
made
no
defence
but
fled
in
terror
nor
does
it
appear
from
the
accounts
of
the
boasted
victors
that
a
weapon
had
been
wielded
by
the
indians
throughout
the
affair
there
seemed
to
be
an
emulation
among
these
trappers
which
could
inflict
the
greatest
outrages
on
the
natives
they
chased
them
at
full
speed
lassoed
them
like
cattle
and
dragged
them
till
they
were
dead
at
one
time
when
some
horses
had
been
stolen
by
the
riccarees
this
same
party
of
trappers
took
two
riccaree
indians
prisoners
and
declared
that
unless
the
tribe
restored
every
horse
that
had
been
stolen
these
two
indians
who
had
strayed
into
the
trappers
camp
without
any
knowledge
of
the
offence
committed
should
be
burnt
to
death
to
give
force
to
their
threat
a
pyre
of
logs
and
fagots
was
heaped
up
and
kindled
into
a
blaze
the
riccarees
released
one
horse
and
then
another
but
finding
that
nothing
but
the
relinquishment
of
all
their
spoils
would
purchase
the
lives
of
the
captives
they
abandoned
them
to
their
fate
moving
off
with
many
parting
words
and
howlings
when
the
prisoners
were
dragged
to
the
blazing
pyre
and
burnt
to
death
in
sight
of
their
retreating
comrades
such
are
the
acts
that
lead
to
terrible
recriminations
on
the
part
of
the
indians
individual
cases
of
the
kind
dwell
in
the
recollections
of
whole
tribes
and
it
is
a
point
of
honor
and
conscience
to
avenge
them
the
records
of
the
wars
between
the
early
settlers
of
virginia
and
new
england
and
the
natives
exhibit
cruelties
on
both
sides
that
make
one
shudder
when
the
indian
would
tear
the
scalp
from
the
crown
of
the
scarcely
yet
dead
victim
and
mutilate
the
body
could
he
be
expected
to
reform
those
cruelties
when
he
saw
the
white
man
in
his
turn
cut
off
the
heads
of
his
people
and
mutilate
and
quarter
their
bodies
as
was
done
with
king
philip
whose
head
after
being
cut
off
was
sent
to
plymouth
and
hung
up
there
on
a
gibbet
where
it
remained
twenty
years
while
one
of
his
hands
was
sent
to
boston
as
a
trophy
his
body
being
quartered
and
hung
upon

i
grieve
to
report
to
you
that
a
most
horrid
massacre
or
rather
an
barbarous
murder
was
perpetrated
on
a
portion
of
the
nason
tribe
residing
at
the

on

the

conclusions
i
will
give
you
the
reasons
which
that
party
assign
in
justification
of
their
acts
they
avow
that
for
some
time
past
the
indians
at
the
mouth
of
the
coquille
have
been
insolent
that
they
have
been
in
the
habit
of
riding
the
horses
of
white
men
without
permission
that
of
late
they
have
committed
many
thefts
such
as
stealing
paddles

many
other
articles

of
white

one
of
their
number
recently
discharged
his
gun
at

but
a
few
days
prior
to
the
attack
on
the
indians
the
chief
on
leaving
the
where
he
had
just
been
fed
fired
his
gun
at
a
party
of
four
white
men
standing
near
the
door
of
the
house
they
further
state
that
on
the
of
january
they
sent
for
the
chief
to
come
in
for
a
talk
that
he
not
only
refused
to
come
in
but
sent
back
word
that
he
would
kill
white
men
if
they
came
to
his
home
that
he
meant
to
kill
all
the
white
men
he
could
that
he
was
determined
to
drive
the
white
men
out
of
his
country
that
he
would
kill
the
men
at
the
ferry
and
burn
their
houses
immediately
after
this
conversation
with
the
chief
the
white
men
at
and
near
the
assembled
and
deliberated
on
the
necessity
of
an
immediate
attack
on
the
indians
the
result
of
their
deliberation
with
the
full
proceedings
of
their
meeting
is
herein
enclosed
at
the
conclusion
a
courier
was
despatched
to
the
upper
mines
for
assistance
a
party
of
about
twenty
responded
to
the
call
and
arrived
at
the
on
the
evening
preceding
the
morning
of
the
massacre
on
the
arrival
of
this
the
proceedings
of
the
meeting
first
held
were
reconsidered
and
unanimously
approved
at
the
dawn
of
day
on
the
morning
of
the
of
january
the
party
of
the
ferry
joined
by
about
twenty
men
from
the
upper
mines
organized
and
in
three
detachments
marched
upon
the
indian
ranches
and
consummated
a
most
inhuman
slaughter
a
full
account
of
what
they
term
fight
you
will
find
in
the
report
which
their
captain
george
abbott
forwarded
to
me
on
the
day
of
the
massacre
the
indians
were
roused
from
sleep
to
meet
their
death
with
but
feeble
show
of
resistance
they
were
shot
down
as
they
were
attempting
to
escape
from
their
houses
fifteen
men
and
one
squaw
killed
two
squaws
badly
wounded
on
the
part
of
the
white
men
not
even
the
slightest
wound
was
received
the
houses
of
the
indians
with
but
one
exception
were
fired
and
entirely
destroyed
thus
was
committed
a
massacre
too
inhuman
to
be
readily
believed
now
for
my
examination
of
this
horrid
affair
on
the
morning
of
the
of
january
i
left
port
orford
for
the
coquille
we
arrived
at
the
early
in
the
evening
of
that
day
early
in
the
morning
of
the
day
after
my
arrival
i
sent
for
the
chief
who
immediately
came
in
attended
by
about
thirty
of
his
people
the
chief
as
well
as
his
people
was
so
greatly
apprehensive
that
the
white
men
would
kill
them
even
in
my
it
was
with
a
good
deal
of
difficulty
that
i
could
induce
him
to
express
his
mind
freely
he
seemed
only
anxious
to
stipulate
for
peace
and
the
future
safety
of
his
people
and
to
procure
this
he
was
willing
to
accept
any
terms
that
i
might
dictate
the
chief
was
evidently
afraid
to
complain
of
or
censure
the
slaughterers
of
his
tribe
and
for
a
time
replied
to
all
the
charges
made
against
him
with
hesitancy
after
repeated
assurances
of
protection
he
finally
answered
to
the
point
every
interrogatory
i
asked
him
if
he
had
at
any
time
fired
at
the
man
at
the
was
his
prompt
reply
at
the
time
he
was
said
to
have
fired
at
the
white
man
he
declared
with
great
earnestness
that
he
shot
at
a
duck
in
the
river
at
a
distance
of
some
two
hundred
yards
from
the
when
on
his
way
home
and
possibly
the
ball
of
his
gun
might
have
bounded
from
the
water
my
subsequent
observation
of
the
course
of
the
river
and
the
point
from
which
he
was
said
to
have
fired
convinced
me
that
his
statement
was
entitled
to
the
fullest
credit
his
statement
is
confirmed
by
the
doubt
expressed
by
one
of
the
party
at
whom
he
was
said
to
have
fired
the
white
men
making
the
accusation
only
heard
the
whizzing
of
a
bullet
this
was
the
only
evidence
adduced
in
proof
of
the
chief
having
fired
at
them
i
asked
the
chief
if
he
or
if
to
his
knowledge
any
of
his
people
had
ever
fired
at
the
to
this
he
answered
he
most
emphatically
denied
ever
sending
threatening
language
to
the
men
at
the
ferry
but
admitted
that
some
of
his
people
had
he
also
admitted
that
some
of
his
tribe
had
stolen
from
white
men
and
that
they
had
used
their
horses
without
permission
he
did
not
deny
that
his
heart
had
been
bad
toward
white
men
and
that
he
had
hoped
they
would
leave
his
country
he
promised
to
do
all
i
required
of
him
if
i
desired
he
said
he
would
leave
the
home
of
his
fathers
and
take
his
people
to
the
mountains
but
with
my
permission
and
protection
he
would
prefer
remaining
in
the
present
home
of
his
people
everything
i
asked
or
required
of
him
he
readily
assented
to
promising
most
solemnly
to
maintain
on
his
part
permanent
friendly
relations
with
white
men
my
interview
with
the
tribe
occupied
about
two
hours
during
the
entire
council
they
listened
with
most
profound
attention
evidently
being
determined
to
fasten
on
their
minds
all
that
fell
from
my
lips
at
the
conclusion
of
the
council
i
requested
the
chief
to
send
for
all
the
guns
and
pistols
in
the
possession
of
his
men
you
will
be
surprised
when
i
tell
you
that
all
the
guns
and
pistols
in
the
hands
of
the
indians
at
the
ranches
amounted
to
just
five
pieces
two
of
which
were
unserviceable
as
to
powder
and
ball
i
do
not
believe
they
had
five
rounds
does
this
look
like
being
prepared
for
war
can
any
sane
man
believe
those
indians
numbering
not
over
all
told
including
women
and
children
had
concocted
a
plan
to
expel
from
their
country
some
three
hundred
whites
such
a
conclusion
is
too
preposterous
to
be
entertained
for
a
moment
there
was
no
necessity
for
resorting
to
such
extreme
measures
i
regard
the
murder
of
those
indians
as
one
of
the
most
barbarous
acts
ever
perpetrated
by
civilized
men
but
what
can
be
done
the
leaders
of
the
party
can
not
be
arrested
though
justice
loudly
demands
their
punishment
here
we
have
not
even
a
justice
of
the
peace
and
as
to
the
military
force
garrisoned
at
fort
orford
it
consists
of
four
men
if
such
murderous
assaults
are
to
be
continued
there
will
be
no
end
of
indian
war
in
smith
the
simon
kenton
referred
to
in
the
following
narrative
was
an
experienced
indian
fighter
and
commanded
a
regiment
in
the
war
of
in
the
course
of
the
war
of
a
plan
was
formed
by
some
of
the
militia
stationed
at
urbana
ohio
to
attack
an
encampment
of
friendly
indians
who
had
been
threatened
by
the
hostile
tribes
and
were
invited
to
remove
with
their
families
within
our
frontier
settlements
as
a
place
of
safety
under
an
assurance
that
they
should
be
protected
kenton
remonstrated
against
the
movement
as
being
not
only
mutinous
but
treacherous
and
cowardly
he
vindicated
the
indian
character
against
the
false
charges
which
were
alleged
in
justification
of
the
outrage
they
were
about
to
perpetrate
and
warned
them
against
the
infamy
they
would
incur
by
destroying
a
defenceless
band
of
men
women
and
children
who
had
been
induced
to
place
themselves
in
their
power
by
a
solemn
promise
of
protection
he
appealed
to
their
humanity
their
honor
and
their
duty
as
soldiers
he
contrasted
his
knowledge
of
the
character
of
those
unfortunate
people
with
their
ignorance
of
it
he
told
them
that
he
had
endured
suffering
and
torture
at
their
hands
again
and
again
but
that
it
was
in
time
of
war
when
they
were
defending
their
wives
and
children
and
when
he
was
seeking
to
destroy
and
exterminate
them
and
that
under
those
circumstances
he
had
no
right
to
complain
and
never
did
complain
but
said
he
in
time
of
peace
they
have
always
been
kind
faithful
friends
and
generous
trustworthy
men
having
exhausted
the
means
of
persuasion
without
effect
and
finding
them
still
resolved
on
executing
their
purpose
he
took
a
rifle
and
called
on
them
to
proceed
at
once
to
the
execution
of
the
foul
with
great
firmness
that
he
would
accompany
them
to
the
encampment
and
shoot
down
the
first
man
who
attempted
to
molest
it
life
said
he
drawing
to
a
close
what
remains
of
it
is
not
worth
much
but
much
or
little
he
was
resolved
that
if
they
entered
the
indian
camp
it
should
be
done
by
passing
over
his
corpse
knowing
that
the
old
veteran
would
fulfil
his
promise
their
hearts
failed
them
not
one
ventured
to
take
the
lead
their
purpose
was
abandoned
and
the
indians
were
saved
on
the
extracts
from
the
report
of
the
commission
sent
to
treat
with
the
sioux
chief
sitting
bull
in
canada
the
commission
consisted
of
terry
hon
lawrence
and
colonel
corbin
secretary
after
one
month
journey
omaha
nebraska
helena
montana
and
fort
benton
these
gentlemen
were
met
on
the
canadian
boundary
by
a
canadian
officer
with
a
mounted
escort
who
conducted
them
to
fort
walsh
when
they
were
met
by
sitting
bull
and
the
other
chiefs
general
terry
recapitulated
to
them
the
advantages
of
being
at
peace
with
the
united
states
the
kindly
treatment
that
all
surrendered
prisoners
had
received
and
said
the
president
invites
you
to
come
to
the
boundary
of
his
and
your
country
and
there
give
up
your
arms
and
ammunition
and
thence
to
go
to
the
agencies
to
which
he
will
assign
you
and
there
give
up
your
horses
excepting
those
which
are
required
for
peace
purposes
your
arms
and
horses
will
then
be
sold
and
with
all
the
money
obtained
for
them
cows
will
be
bought
and
sent
to
you
it
is
mortifying
to
think
that
representatives
of
the
united
states
should
have
been
compelled
gravely
to
submit
in
a
formal
council
proposals
so
ludicrous
as
these
the
indians
must
have
been
totally
without
sense
of
humor
if
they
could
have
listened
to
them
without
laughter
sitting
bull
reply
is
worthy
of
being
put
on
record
among
the
notable
protests
of
indian
chiefs
against
the
oppressions
of
their
race
he
said
for
years
you
have
kept
me
and
my
people
and
treated
us
bad
what
have
we
done
that
you
should
want
us
to
stop
we
have
done
nothing
it
is
all
the
people
on
your
side
that
have
started
us
to
do
all
these
depredations
we
could
not
go
anywhere
else
and
so
we
took
refuge
in
this
country
i
would
like
to
know
why
you
came
here
in
the
first
place
i
did
not
give
you
the
country
but
you
followed
me
from
one
place
to
another
so
i
had
to
leave
and
come
over
to
this
country
you
have
got
ears
and
you
have
got
eyes
to
see
with
them
and
you
see
how
i
live
with
these
people

see
me
here

am

a
fool

are
a
bigger
fool
than
i
am
this
house

a
medicine
house

come
here
to
tell
us
lies
but
we
want
to
hear
them

do
wish

such
language

to
is
to
tell
me
lies
in
my
great
mother
house
this
country
is
mine
and
i
intend
to
stay
here
and
to
raise
this
country

of
grown
people

these
people
here
we
were
raised
with
them
again
shaking
hands
with
the
british
officers
that
is
enough
so
no
more
the
part
of
the
country
you
gave
me
you
ran
me
out
of
i
wish
you
to
go
back
and
to
take
it
easy

back
a
santee
chief
said
you
did
treat
us
well
and
i
do
like
you
at
all
i
will
be
at
peace
with
these
people
as
long
as
i
live
this
country

ours
we
did
not
give
it
to
you
you
stole
it
away
from
us
you
have
come
over
here
to
tell
us
lies
and
i
do
propose
to
talk

have
to
say
i
want
you
to
take
it
easy

a
yankton
said
years
ago

country
and
you
promised
to
take
good
care
of
us
and
keep
us
you
ran
from
one
place
to
another
killing
us
and
fighting
us
you
did
not
treat
us
right
over
there
so
we
came
back
over
here
i
come
in
to
these
people
here
they
give
me
permission
to
trade
with
the
is
the
way
i
make
my
everything
i
get
i
buy
from
the
traders
i
do
steal
anything
i
am
going
to
live
with
these
people
here
so
profound
a
contempt
did
the
indians
feel
for
this
commission
that
they
allowed
a
squaw
to
address
it
a
squaw
named
wife
of
said
i
was
over
at
your
country
i
wanted
to
raise
my
children
there
but
you
did
not
give
me
any
time
i
came
over
to
this
country
to
raise
my
children
and
have
a
little
peace
shaking
hands
with
the
british
officers
that
is
all
i
have
to
say
to
you
i
want
you
to
go
back
where
you
came
from
these
are
the
people
that
i
am
going
to
stay
with
and
raise
my
children
with
the
indians
having
risen
being
apparently
about
to
leave
the
room
the
interpreter
was
directed
to
ask
the
following
questions
shall
i
say
to
the
president
that
you
refuse
the
offers
that
he
has
made
to
you
are
we
to
understand
that
you
refuse
those
offers
sitting
bull
answered
i
could
tell
you
more
but
that
is
all
i
have
to
tell
if
we
told
you
more
you
would
not
pay
any
attention
to
it
this
part
of
the
country
does
not
belong
to
your
people
you
belong
on
the
other
side
this
side
belongs
to
us
the
crow
shaking
hands
and
embracing
colonel
mcleod
and
shaking
hands
with
the
other
british
officers
said
this
is
the
way
i
will
live
in
this
part
of
the
country
people
that
do
hide
they
are
all
the
people
i
like
years
ago
i
shook
hands
with
the
soldiers
and
ever
since
that
i
have
had
hardships
i
made
peace
with
them
and
ever
since
then
i
have
been
running
from
one
place
to
another
to
keep
out
of
their
way
go
to
where
you
were
born
and
stay
there
i
came
over
to
this
country
and
my
great
mother
knows
all
about
it
she
knows
i
came
over
here
and
she
do
wish
anything
of
me
we
think
and
all
the
women
in
the
camp
think
we
are
going
to
have
the
country
full
of
people
i
have
come
back
in
this
part
of
the
country
again
to
have
plenty
more
people
to
live
in
peace
and
raise
children
the
indians
then
inquired
whether
the
commission
had
anything
more
to
say
and
the
commission
answered
that
they
had
nothing
more
to
say
and
the
conference
closed
the
commission
with
a
naïve
lack
of
comprehension
of
the
true
situation
of
the
case
go
on
to
say
that
they
are
convinced
that
sitting
bull
and
the
bands
under
him
will
not
seek
to
return
to
this
country
at
present
it
is
believed
that
they
are
restrained
from
returning
partly
by
their
recollection
of
the
severe
handling
they
had
by
the
military
forces
of
the
united
states
in
the
last
winter
and
spring
and
partly
by
their
belief
that
for
some
reason
which
they
can
not
fathom
the
government
of
the
united
states
earnestly
desires
that
they
shall
return
in
their
intense
hostility
to
our
government
they
are
determined
to
contravene
its
wishes
to
the
best
of
their
ability
it
would
seem
to
the
extent
of
foregoing
all
the
privileges
offered
them
on
their
giving
up
of
all
exchanging
of
their
horses
for
the
priceless
privilege
of
being
shut
up
on
reservations
off
which
they
could
not
go
without
being
pursued
arrested
and
brought
back
by
troops
what
a
depth
of
malignity
must
be
in
the
breasts
of
these
indians
that
to
gratify
it
they
will
voluntarily
relinquish
all
these
benefits
and
continue
to
remain
in
a
country
where
they
must
continue
to
hunt
and
make
their
own
living
on
the
unjust
plan
of
free
trade
in
open
markets
vi
account
of
some
of
the
old
grievances
of
the
sioux
interview
between
red
iron
chief
of
the
sisseton
sioux
and
governor
ramsey
in
december
claims
had
been
set
up
by
the
indian
traders
for
of
the
money
promised
to
the
sioux
by
the
treaties
of
and
the

not

so
much

endeavored
to
compel

receipt
for
it
he
refused

said

never
had

asked

governor

men
and
one
indian

was
refused

then
said
that
he
would
accept
three
white

as
arbitrators
if
they
were
honest
men
this
was
refused
an
has
sketched
the
appearance
of
the
chief
on
that
occasion
and
the
interview
between
him
and
the
governor
the
council
was
crowded
with
indians
and
white
men
when
red
iron
was
brought
in
guarded
by
soldiers
he
was
about
forty
years
old
tall
and
athletic
about
six
feet
high
in
his
moccasins
with
a
large
head
aquiline
nose
thin
compressed
lips
and
physiognomy
beaming
with
intelligence
and
resolution
he
was
clad
in
the
costume
of
the
dakota
chiefs
he
was
seated
in
the
without
greeting
or
salutation
from
any
one
in
a
few
minutes
the
governor
turning
to
the
chief
in
the
midst
of
a
breathless
silence
by
the
aid
of
an
interpreter
opened
the
council
governor
ramsey
asked
what
excuse
have
you
for
not
coming
to
the
council
when
i
sent
for
you
the
chief
rose
to
his
feet
with
native
grace
and
dignity
his
blanket
falling
from
his
shoulders
and
purposely
dropping
the
pipe
of
peace
he
stood
erect
before
the
governor
with
his
arms
folded
and
right
hand
pressed
on
the
sheath
of
his
with
firm
voice
he
replied
i
started
to
come
but
your
braves
drove
me
back
what
excuse
have
you
for
not
coming
the
second
time
i
sent
for
you
no
other
excuse
than
i
have
given
you
at
the
treaty
i
thought
you
a
good
man
but
since
you
have
acted
badly
and
i
am
disposed
to
break
you
i
do
break
you
you
break
me
my
people
made
me
a
chief
my
people
love
me
i
will
still
be
their
chief
i
have
done
nothing
wrong
why
did
you
get
your
braves
together
and
march
around
here
for
the
purpose
of
intimidating
other
chiefs
and
prevent
their
coming
to
the
council
i
did
not
get
my
braves
together
they
got
together
themselves
to
prevent
boys
going
to
council
to
be
made
chiefs
to
sign
papers
and
to
prevent
single
chiefs
going
to
council
at
night
to
be
bribed
to
sign
papers
for
money
we
have
never
got
we
have
heard
how
the
medewakantons
were
served
at
mendota
that
by
secret
councils
you
got
their
names
on
paper
and
took
away
their
money
we
do
want
to
be
served
so
my
braves
wanted
to
come
to
council
in
the
daytime
when
the
sun
shines
and
we
want
no
councils
in
the
dark
we
want
all
our
people
to
go
to
council
together
so
that
we
can
all
know
what
is
done
why
did
you
attempt
to
come
to
council
with
your
braves
when
i
had
forbidden
your
braves
coming
to
council
you
invited
the
chiefs
only
and
would
not
let
the
braves
come
too
this
is
not
the
way
we
have
been
treated
before
this
is
not
according
to
our
customs
for
among
dakotas
chiefs
and
braves
go
to
council
together
when
you
first
sent
for
us
there
were
two
or
three
chiefs
here
and
we
wanted
to
wait
till
the
rest
would
come
that
we
might
all
be
in
council
together
and
know
what
was
done
and
so
that
we
might
all
understand
the
papers
and
know
what
we
were
signing
when
we
signed
the
treaty
the
traders
threw
a
blanket
over
our
faces
and
darkened
our
eyes
and
made
us
sign
papers
which
we
did
not
understand
and
which
were
not
explained
or
read
to
us
we
want
our
great
father
at
washington
to
know
what
has
been
done
your
great
father
has
sent
me
to
represent
him
and
what
i
say
is
what
he
says
he
wants
you
to
pay
your
old
debts
in
accordance
with
the
paper
you
signed
when
the
treaty
was
made
and
to
leave
that
money
in
my
hands
to
pay
these
debts
if
you
refuse
to
do
that
i
will
take
the
money
back
you
can
take
the
money
back
we
sold
our
land
to
you
and
you
promised
to
pay
us
if
you
do
give
us
the
money
i
will
be
glad
and
all
our
people
will
be
glad
for
we
will
have
our
land
back
if
you
do
give
us
the
money
that
paper
was
not
interpreted
or
explained
to
us
we
are
told
it
gives
about
boxes
of
our
money
to
some
of
the
traders
we
do
think
we
owe
them
so
much
we
want
to
pay
all
our
debts
we
want
our
great
father
to
send
three
good
men
here
to
tell
us
how
much
we
do
owe
and
whatever
they
say
we
will
pay
and
what
all
these
braves
say
our
chiefs
and
all
our
people
say
this
all
the
indians
present
responded
ho

that
ca

done

owe
more
than
your
money

annuity

papers

long
time
for
our
moneys

of
our
people
are
sick
for
being
hungry
we
may
die
because

place
to

dead
and
you

not
pay
us
the
money
for
our
lands
the
council
was
broken
up
and
red
iron
was
sent
to
the
where
he
was
kept
till
next
day
between
thirty
and
forty
of
the
braves
of
red
iron
band
were
present
during
this
arrangement
before
the
governor
when
he
was
led
away
they
departed
in
sullen
silence
headed
by
lean
bear
to
a
spot
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
where
they
uttered
a
succession
of
gathering
signal
of
the
dakotas
ere
the
echoes
died
away
indians
were
hurrying
from
their
tepees
toward
them
prepared
for
battle
they
proceeded
to
the
eminence
near
the
camp
where
mouldered
the
bones
of
many
warriors
it
was
the
memorable
where
their
ancestors
had
fought
in
a
conflict
like
waterloo
the
warlike
sacs
and
foxes
thereby
preserving
their
lands
and
nationality
upon
this
field
stood
two
hundred
resolute
warriors
ready
to
do
battle
for
their
hereditary
chief
lean
bear
the
principal
brave
of
red
iron
band
was
a
large
resolute
man
about
years
of
age
and
had
great
influence
in
his
nation
here
on
their
old
lean
bear
recounted
the
brave
deeds
of
red
iron
the
long
list
of
wrongs
inflicted
on
the
indians
by
the
white
men
and
proposed
to
the
braves
that
they
should
make
a
general
attack
on
the
whites
by
the
influence
of
some
of
the
and
of
white
men
who
were
known
to
be
friendly
to
them
lean
bear
was
induced
to
abandon
his
scheme
and
finally
the
tribe
being
starving
consented
to
give
up
their
lands
and
accept
the
sum
of
money
offered
to
them
over
of
this
treaty
money

years
later
another

the
pretence
that
he
was
going
to
get
back
for
them
some
of
this
stolen
treaty

obtained
their
signature
to
vouchers
by
means
of
which
he
cheated
them

this
same
time

obtained
a
payment

for
goods

said
they
had
stolen
from

of
all
their

of
the
minnesota
river
under
which
as
ratified
by
the
senate
they
were
to
have
but
of
this
amount
they
never
received
one
penny
till
four
years
afterward
when
in
goods
were
sent
to
the
lower
sioux
and
these
were
deducted
out
of
what
was
due
them
under
former
treaties

the
causes
of
the
fearful
minnesota

which
eight
hundred
people
lost
their
lives
the
treaty
expressly
provided
that
no
claims
against
the
indians
should
be
paid
unless
approved
by
the
indians
in
open
council
no
such
council
was
held
a
secret
council
was
held
with
a
few
chiefs
but
the
body
of
the
indians
were
ignorant
of
it
there
was
a
clause
in
this
treaty
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
might
use
any
funds
of
the
indians
for
such
purposes
of
civilization
as
his
judgment
should
dictate
under
this
clause
the
avails
of
over
six
hundred
thousand
acres
of
land
were
taken
for
claims
against
the
indians
of
the
vast
amount
due
to
the
lower
sioux
only
a
little
over
was
left
to
their
credit
in
washington
at
the
time
of
the
outbreak
moreover
a
portion
of
their
annual
annuity
was
also
taken
for
claims
removal
of
the
sioux
and
winnebagoes
from
minnesota
in
the

these
indians
and
the
guard
there
was
paid
the
sum
of
the
number
of
winnebagoes
transported
was
nineteen
hundred
and
for
their
transportation
and
subsistence
there
was
paid
the
farther
sum
of
the
whole
amount
paid
the
contractors
the
sioux
were
transported
from
fort
snelling
to
hannibal
missouri
on
two
steamboats
one
of
the
boats
stopped
there
and
the
indians
on
it
crossed
over
to
joseph
on
the
missouri
river
by
rail
the
other
boat
continued
to
the
junction
of
the
mississippi
and
missouri
rivers
and
thence
up
the
latter
to
joseph
and
here
the
indians
that
crossed
over
by
rail
were
put
upon
the
boat
and
from
thence
to
crow
creek
all
of
them
were
on
one
boat
they
were
very
much
crowded
from
joseph
to
crow
creek
sixteen
died
on
the
way
being
without
attention
or
medical
supplies
all
the
indians
were
excluded
from
the
cabin
of
the
boat
and
confined
to
the
lower
and
upper
decks
it
was
in
may
and
to
go
among
them
on
the
lower
deck
was
suffocating
they
were
fed
on
hard
bread
and
mess
pork
much
of
it
not
cooked
there
being
no
opportunity
to
cook
it
only
at
night
when
the
boat
laid
up
they
had
no
sugar
coffee
or
vegetables
confinement
on
the
boat
in
such
a
mass
and
want
of
proper
food
created
much
sickness
such
as
diarrhœa
and
fevers
for
weeks
after
they
arrived
at
crow
creek
the
indians
died
at
the
rate
of
from
three
to
four
per
day
in
a
few
weeks
one
hundred
and
fifty
had
died
mainly
on
account
of
the
treatment
they
had
received
after
leaving
fort
snelling
our
indian
food
of
the
indians
at
crow
creek
dakota
in
the
winter
of
during
the
summer
the
indians
were
fed
on
flour
and
pork
they
got
no
beef
till
fall
they
suffered
for
want
of
fresh
beef
as
well
as
for
medical
supplies
in
the
fall
their
ration
began
to
fail
and
the
issue
was
gradually
reduced
and
the
indians
complained
bitterly
the
beef
furnished
was
from
the
cattle
that
hauled
the
supplies
from
minnesota
these
cattle
had
travelled
over
three
hundred
miles
hauling
the
train
with
nothing
to
eat
but
the
dry
prairie
grass
there
being
no
settlements
on
the
route
they
came
the
cattle
were
very
poor
some
died
or
gave
out
on
the
trip
and
such
were
slaughtered
and
the
meat
brought
in
on
the
train
for
food
for
the
indians
about
the
of
january
near
four
hundred
of
the
cattle
were
slaughtered
except
the
dry
prairie
grass
which
the
frost
had
killed
these
cattle
had
no
food
from
the
time
they
came
to
crow
creek
until
they
were
slaughtered
a
part
of
the
beef
thus
made
was
piled
up
in
the
warehouse
in
snow
and
the
remainder
in
like
manner
packed
in
snow
outside
this
beef
was
to
keep
the
indians
until
the
coming
june
the
beef
was
black
and
very
greater
part
only
skin
and
bone
shortly
after
the
arrival
of
the
train
from
minnesota
the
contractors
for
supplying
the
indians
with
flour
took
about
one
hundred
head
of
the
oxen
selecting
the
best
of
them
yoked
them
up
and
sent
them
with
wagons
to
sioux
city
some
two
hundred
and
forty
miles
to
haul
up
flour
this
train
returned
in
february
and
these
oxen
were
then
slaughtered
and
fed
to
the
indians
in
january
the
issue
of
soup
to
the
indians
commenced
it
was
made
in
a
large
vat
being
cooked
by
steam
carried
from
the
boiler
of
the
in
a
pipe
to
the
vat
the
vat
was
partly
filled
with
water
then
several
quarters
of
beef
chopped
up
were
thrown
into
it
and
a
few
sacks
of
flour
added
the
hearts
lights
and
entrails
were
added
to
the
compound
and
in
the
beginning
a
few
beans
were
put
into
the
vat
but
this
luxury
did
not
continue
long
this
soup
was
issued
every
other
the
santee
sioux
one
day
the
alternate
day
to
the
winnebagoes
it
was
very
unpalatable
on
the
day
the
indians
received
the
soup
they
had
no
other
food
issued
to
them
they
were
very
much
dissatisfied
and
said
they
could
not
live
on
the
soup
when
those
in
charge
told
them
if
they
could
live
elsewhere
they
had
better
go
but
that
they
must
not
go
to
the
white
settlements
many
of
them
did
leave
the
agency
some
going
to
fort
sully
others
to
fort
randall
in
search
of
food
from
a
description
of
this
nauseous
mess
called
soup
given
by
samuel
haynes
then
at
fort
randall
and
in
the
military
service
it
is
seen
that
the
indians
had
good
cause
to
leave
crow
creek
he
states
that
there
were
thrown
into
the
vat
entrails
of
the
beeves
some
beans
flour
and
pork
i
think
there
were
put
into
the
vat
two
barrels
of
flour
each
time
which
was
not
oftener
than
once
in
hours
this
mass
was
then
cooked
by
the
steam
from
the
boiler
passing
through
the
pipe
into
the
vat
when
that
was
done
all
the
indians
were
ordered
to
come
with
their
pails
and
get
it
it
was
dipped
out
to
the
indians
with
a
dipper
made
for
the
purpose
i
can
not
say
the
quantity
given
to
each
it
was
about
the
consistency
of
very
thin
gruel
the
indians
would
pour
off
the
thinner
portion
and
eat
that
which
settled
at
the
bottom
as
it
was
dipped
out
of
the
vat
some
of
the
indians
would
get
the
thinner
portions
and
some
would
get
some
meat
i
passed
there
frequently
when
it
was
cooking
and
was
often
there
when
it
was
being
issued
it
had
a
very
offensive
odor
it
had
the
odor
of
the
contents
of
the
entrails
of
the
beeves
i
have
seen
the
settlings
of
the
vat
after
they
were
through
issuing
it
to
the
indians
when
they
were
cleaning
the
vat
and
the
settlings
smelled
like
decomposed
meat
some
of
the
indians
refused
to
eat
it
saying
they
could
not
it
made
them
sick

winnemucca
an
educated
woman
major
douglas
sir
learn
from
the
commanding
officer
at
this
post
that
you
desire
full
information
in
regard
to
the
indians
around
this
place
with
a
view
if
possible
of
bettering
their
condition
by
sending
them
on
the
truckee
river
reservation
all
the
indians
from
here
to
carson
city
belong
to
the
tribe
my
father
whose
name
is
winnemucca
is
the
head
chief
of
the
whole
tribe
but
he
is
now
getting
too
old
and
has
not
energy
enough
to
command
nor
to
impress
on
their
minds
the
necessity
of
their
being
sent
on
the
reservation
in
fact
i
think
he
is
entirely
opposed
to
it
he
myself
and
most
of
the
humboldt
and
river
indians
were
on
the
truckee
reservation
at
one
time
but
if
we
had
stayed
there
it
would
be
only
to
starve
i
think
that
if
they
had
received
what
they
were
entitled
to
from
the
agents
they
would
never
have
left
them
so
far
as
their
knowledge
of
agriculture
extends
they
are
quite
ignorant
as
they
have
never
had
the
opportunity
of
learning
but
i
think
if
proper
pains
were
taken
that
they
would
willingly
make
the
effort
to
maintain
themselves
by
their
own
labor
providing
they
could
be
made
to
believe
that
the
products
were
their
own
for
their
own
use
and
comfort
it
is
needless
for
me
to
enter
into
details
as
to
how
we
were
treated
on
the
reservation
while
there
it
is
enough
to
say
that
we
were
confined
to
the
reserve
and
had
to
live
on
what
fish
we
might
be
able
to
catch
in
the
river
if
this
is
the
kind
of
civilization
awaiting
us
on
the
reserves
god
grant
that
we
may
never
be
compelled
to
go
on
one
as
it
is
much
preferable
to
live
in
the
mountains
and
drag
out
an
existence
in
our
native
manner
so
far
as
living
is
concerned
the
indians
at
all
military
posts
get
enough
to
eat
and
considerable
clothing
but
how
long
is
this
to
continue
what
is
the
object
of
the
government
in
regard
to
indians
is
it
enough
that
we
are
at
peace
remove
all
the
indians
from
the
military
posts
and
place
them
on
reservations
such
as
the
truckee
and
walker
river
reservations
as
they
were
conducted
and
it
will
require
a
greater
military
force
stationed
round
to
keep
them
within
the
limits
than
it
now
does
to
keep
them
in
subjection
on
the
other
hand
if
the
indians
have
any
guarantee
that
they
can
secure
a
permanent
home
on
their
own
native
soil
and
that
our
white
neighbors
can
be
kept
from
encroaching
on
our
rights
after
having
a
reasonable
share
of
ground
allotted
to
us
as
our
own
and
giving
us
the
required
advantages
of
learning
i
warrant
that
the
savage
as
he
is
called
will
be
a
thrifty
and
member
of
the
community
fifteen
or
twenty
years
hence
sir
if
at
any
future
time
you
should
require
information
regarding
the
indians
here
i
will
be
happy
to
furnish
the
same

ix
account
of
the
cherokee
who
invented
the
cherokee
alphabet
sequoyah
a
cherokee
indian
instead
of
joining
the
rude
sports
of
indian
boys
while
a
child
took
great
delight
in
exercising
his
ingenuity
by
various
mechanical
labors
he
also
assisted
in
the
management
of
his
mother
property
consisting
of
a
farm
and
cattle
and
horses
in
his
intercourse
with
the
whites
he
became
aware
that
they
possessed
an
art
by
which
a
name
impressed
upon
a
hard
substance
might
be
understood
at
a
glance
by
any
one
acquainted
with
the
art
he
requested
an
educated
named
charles
hicks
to
write
his
name
which
being
done
he
made
a
die
containing
a
of
the
word
which
he
stamped
upon
all
the
articles
fabricated
by
his
mechanical
ingenuity
from
this
he
proceeded
to
the
art
of
drawing
in
which
he
made
rapid
progress
before
he
had
the
opportunity
of
seeing
a
picture
or
engraving
these
accomplishments
made
the
young
man
very
popular
among
his
associates
and
particularly
among
the
red
ladies
but
it
was
long
before
incessant
adulation
produced
any
evil
effect
upon
his
character
at
length
however
he
was
prevailed
upon
to
join
his
companions
and
share
in
the
carouse
which
had
been
supplied
by
his
own
industry
but
he
soon
wearied
of
an
idle
and
dissipated
life
suddenly
resolved
to
give
up
drinking
and
learned
the
trade
of
a
blacksmith
by
his
own
unaided
efforts
in
the
year
while
on
a
visit
to
some
friends
in
a
cherokee
village
he
listened
to
a
conversation
on
the
art
of
writing
which
seems
always
to
have
been
the
subject
of
great
curiosity
among
the
indians
sequoyah
remarked
that
he
did
not
regard
the
art
as
so
very
extraordinary
and
believed
he
could
invent
a
plan
by
which
the
red
man
might
do
the
same
thing
the
company
were
incredulous
but
the
matter
had
long
been
the
subject
of
his
reflections
and
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
letters
represented
words
or
ideas
and
being
always
uniform
would
always
convey
the
same
meaning
his
first
plan
was
to
invent
signs
for
words
but
upon
trial
he
was
speedily
satisfied
that
this
would
be
too
cumbrous
and
laborious
and
he
soon
contrived
the
plan
of
an
alphabet
which
should
represent
sounds
each
character
standing
for
a
syllable
he
persevered
in
carrying
out
his
intention
and
attained
his
object
by
forming
characters
while
thus
employed
he
incurred
the
ridicule
of
his
neighbors
and
was
entreated
to
desist
by
his
friends
the
invention
however
was
completely
successful
and
the
cherokee
dialect
is
now
a
written
language
a
result
entirely
due
to
the
extraordinary
genius
of
sequoyah
after
teaching
many
to
read
and
write
he
left
the
cherokee
nation
in
on
a
visit
to
arkansas
and
introduced
the
art
among
the
cherokees
who
had
emigrated
to
that
country
and
after
his
return
home
a
correspondence
was
opened
in
the
cherokee
language
between
the
two
branches
of
the
nation
in
the
autumn
of
the
general
council
bestowed
upon
him
a
silver
medal
in
honor
of
his
genius
and
as
an
expression
of
gratitude
for
his
eminent
public
services
american
we
may
remark
with
reference
to
the
above
that
as
each
letter
of
this
alphabet
represents
one
of
sounds
of
which
in
various
transpositions
the
language
is
composed
a
cherokee
can
read
as
soon
as
he
has
learned
his
alphabet
it
is
said
that
a
clever
boy
may
thus
be
taught
to

by
indians
in
dakota
in
his
report
for
the
superintendent
of
indian
affairs
in
dakota
says
orders
have
been
received
to
stop
cutting
of
wood
by
indians
to
pay
them
for
what
they
have
already
cut
to
take
possession
of
it
and
sell
it
this
i
am
advised
is
under
a
recent
decision
which
deprives
indians
of
any
ownership
in
the
wood
until
the
land
is
taken
by
them
in
severalty
if
agents
do
not
enforce
these
orders
they
lay
themselves
liable
if
they
do
enforce
them
the
indians
are
deprived
of
what
little
motive
they
have
for
labor
in
the
mean
time
aliens
of
all
nations
cut
wood
on
indian
lands
sell
to
steamboats
fill
contracts
for
the
army
and
for
indian
agencies
at
high
prices
cutting
wood
is
one
of
the
very
few
things
an
indian
can
do
in
dakota

this

xiii
sequel
to
the
walla
walla
massacre
this
narrative
was
written
by
a
army
officer
correspondent
of
the
and
navy
and
appeared
in
that
paper
the
history
of
that
affair
the
walla
walla
massacre
was
never
written
we
believe
or
if
it
was
the
absolute
facts
in
the
case
were
never
given
by
any
unprejudiced
person
and
it
may
be
interesting
to
not
a
few
to
give
them
here
the
story
as
told
by
our
washington
correspondent
ebbitt
who
was
a
witness
of
the
scenes
narrated
is
as
follows
the
first
settlements
in
oregon
some
thirty
years
ago
were
made
by
a
colony
of
methodists
one
of
the
principal
men
among
them
was
the
late
or
governor
abernethy
as
he
was
called
as
he
was
for
a
short
time
the
prominent
governor
of
oregon
he
was
the
of
our
genial
deputy
henry
hodges
an
excellent
man
and
he
must
not
be
remembered
as
one
of
those
who
were
responsible
for
the
shocking
proceedings
which
we
are
about
to
relate
a
minister
by
the
name
of
whitman
we
believe
had
gone
up
to
the
walla
walla
region
where
he
was
kindly
received
by
the
cayuse
and
other
friendly
indians
who
while
they
did
not
particularly
desire
to
be
converted
to
the
christian
faith
as
expounded
by
one
of
wesley
followers
saw
no
special
objection
to
the
presence
of
the
missionary
so
they
lived
quietly
along
for
a
year
or
two
then
the
measles
broke
out
among
the
indians
and
a
large
number
of
them
were
carried
off
they
were
told
by
their
medicine
men
that
the
disease
was
owing
to
the
presence
of
the
whites
and
whitman
was
notified
that
he
must
leave
their
country
filled
with
zeal
for
the
cause
and
not
having
sense
enough
to
grasp
the
situation
he
refused
to
go
at
this
time
the
people
of
the
hudson
bay
company
had
great
influence
with
all
the
indians
in
that
region
and
the
good
old
governor
peter
skeen
ogden
was
the
chief
factor
of
the
company
at
fort
vancouver
he
was
apprised
of
the
state
of
feeling
among
the
indians
near
the
mission
by
the
indians
themselves
and
he
was
entreated
by
them
to
urge
whitman
to
go
away
for
if
he
did
not
he
would
surely
be
killed
the
governor
wrote
up
to
the
mission
advising
them
to
leave
for
a
while
at
least
until
the
indians
should
become
quiet
which
they
would
do
as
soon
as
the
measles
had
run
its
course
among
them
his
efforts
were
useless
and
sure
enough
one
day
in
we
believe
the
mission
was
cleaned
out
the
missionary
and
nearly
all
of
those
connected
with
it
being
killed
an
indian
war
follows
this
was
carried
on
for
some
months
and
with
little
damage
but
sufficient
for
a
claim
by
the
territory
upon
the
general
government
for
untold
amounts
of
money
two
or
three
years
later
when
the
country
had
commenced
to
fill
up
with
emigration
and
after
the
regiment
of
mounted
riflemen
and
two
companies
of
the
first
artillery
had
taken
post
in
oregon
the
people
began
to
think
that
it
would
be
well
to
stir
up
the
matter
of
the
murder
of
the
whitman
family
general
joseph
lane
had
been
sent
out
as
governor
in
and
he
doubtless
thought
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
him
politically
to
humor
the
people
of
the
territory
lane
was
a
vigorous
resolute
western
man
who
had
been
a
general
officer
during
the
mexican
war
and
he
then
had
presidential
aspirations
so
the
governor
came
to
fort
vancouver
where
the
of
the
department
were
established
under
colonel
loring
of
the
mounted
rifles
and
procured
a
small
escort
with
which
he
proceeded
to
hunt
up
the
indians
concerned
in
the
massacre
and
demand
their
surrender
by
this
time
the
indians
had
begun
to
comprehend
the
power
of
the
government
and
when
the
governor
found
them
and
explained
the
nature
of
his
mission
they
went
into
council
to
decide
what
was
to
be
done
after
due
deliberation
they
were
convinced
that
if
they
were
to
refuse
to
come
to
any
terms
they
would
be
attacked
by
the
soldiers
of
whom
they
then
had
deadly
fear
and
obliged
to
abandon
their
country
forever
so
they
met
the
governor
and
the
head
chief
said
that
they
had
heard
what
he
had
to
say
it
was
true
that
his
people
had
killed
the
whites
at
the
mission
but
that
they
did
so
for
the
reason
that
they
really
thought
that
a
terrible
disease
had
been
brought
among
them
by
the
whites
that
they
had
begged
them
to
go
away
from
them
for
they
did
not
wish
to
kill
them
and
that
they
only
killed
them
to
save
their
own
lives
as
they
thought
he
said
that
for
this
the
whites
from
down
the
columbia
had
made
war
upon
them
and
killed
many
more
of
their
people
than
had
been
killed
at
the
mission
and
they
thought
they
ought
to
be
satisfied
as
they
were
not
three
of
their
principal
men
had
volunteered
to
go
back
with
the
governor
to
oregon
city
to
be
tried
for
the
murder
this
satisfied
the
governor
and
the
men
bid
farewell
to
their
wives
and
little
ones
and
to
all
their
tribe
for
they
very
well
knew
that
they
would
never
see
them
again
they
knew
that
they
were
going
among
those
who
thirsted
for
their
blood
and
that
they
were
going
to
their
death
and
that
death
the
most
ignominious
that
can
be
accorded
to
the
red
man
as
they
were
to
be
hung
like
dogs
the
governor
and
his
party
left
the
victims
gave
one
long
last
look
at
the
shore
as
they
took
the
little
boat
on
the
columbia
but
no
word
of
complaint
ever
came
from
their
lips
when
they
arrived
at
fort
vancouver
we
had
charge
of
these
indians
they
were
not
restrained
in
any
guard
was
ever
kept
over
them
for
there
was
no
power
on
earth
that
could
have
made
them
falter
in
their
determination
to
go
down
to
oregon
city
and
die
like
men
for
the
salvation
of
their
tribe
at
oregon
city
these
men
walked
with
their
heads
erect
and
with
the
bearing
of
senators
from
the
little
boat
amidst
the
jibes
and
jeers
of
a
brutal
crowd
to
the
jail
which
was
to
be
the
last
covering
they
would
ever
have
over
their
heads
the
trial
came
on
the
jury
was
empanelled
and
captain
claiborne
of
the
mounted
rifles
volunteered
to
defend
the
indians
who
were
told
that
they
were
to
have
a
fair
trial
and
that
they
would
not
be
punished
unless
they
were
found
guilty
to
all
this
they
paid
no
heed
they
said
it
was
all
right
but
they
did
not
understand
a
word
of
what
they
were
compelled
to
listen
to
for
several
days
and
they
cared
nothing
for
the
forms
of
the
law
they
had
come
to
die
and
when
some
witnesses
swore
that
they
recognized
them
as
the
very
indians
who
killed
of
which
was
explained
to
a
muscle
of
their
faces
changed
although
it
was
more
than
suspected
that
the
witnesses
were
never
near
the
mission
at
the
time
of
the
massacre
the
trial
was
over
and
of
course
the
indians
were
condemned
to
be
hanged
without
a
murmur
or
sigh
of
regret
and
with
a
dignity
that
would
have
impressed
a
zulu
with
profound
pity
these
men
walked
to
the
gallows
and
were
hung
while
a
crowd
of
civilized
women
and
children
of
the
nineteenth
on
and
laughed
at
their
last
convulsive
twitches
we
have
read
of
heroes
of
all
times
but
never
did
we
read
of
or
believe
that
such
heroism
as
these
indians
exhibited
could
exist
they
knew
that
to
be
accused
was
to
be
condemned
and
they
would
be
executed
in
the
civilized
town
of
oregon
city
just
as
surely
as
would
a
poor
woman
accused
of
being
a

have
been
executed
in

civilized

christian
town
of
salem
in

was
the

of
a
as
great
as
any
of

we

there
were

perhaps
as
much
to

as
to
the
excess

these

have
of

most
unfortunately
fallen
short

the
greater
part
of

lead

somewhat
roving
life
finding

chiefly
in

hunted

little
is
done
in
the
way
of
cultivating

certain

have
of

been
greatly
demoralized

portions
of
this
people
however
especially
those
situated
at
the
bad

reservation
have
begun
to
evince
an
earnest
desire
for
many
live
in
houses
of
rude
construction
and
raise
small
crops
of
grain
and
vegetables
others
labor
among
the
whites
and
a
number
find
employment
in
cutting
rails
and
for
the
government
in
regard
to
the
efforts
made
to
instruct
the
children
in
letters
it
may
be
said
that
without
being
altogether
fruitless
the
results
have
been
thus
far
meagre
and
somewhat
discouraging
the
majority
of
the
parents
profess
to
wish
to
have
their
children
educated
and
ask
for
schools
but
when
the
means
are
provided
and
the
work
undertaken
the
difficulties
in
the
way
of
success
to
any
considerable
extent
appear
in
the
undisciplined
character
of
the
scholars
which
has
to
be
overcome
by
the
teacher
without
parental
and
in
the
great
irregularity
of
attendance
at
school
especially
on
the
part
of
those
who
are
obliged
to
accompany
their
parents
to
the
the

the
number
and
are
located
on

formerly
owned
most
of
the
eastern
portion
of
the

and
by

entered
into
with
the

on
the
of
october
ceded
the

a
home
in
minnesota
upon
lands
that
had
been
obtained
by
the
united

from
the
chippewas
but
becoming
dissatisfied
with
the
arrangement
as
not
having
accorded
them
what
they
claimed
to
be
rightfully
due
subsequently
protested
and
manifested
great
unwillingness
to
remove
in
view
of
this
condition
of
affairs
they
were
by
the
president
permitted
to
remain
in
wisconsin
and
temporarily
located
upon
the
lands
they
now
occupy
which
were
secured
to
them
by
a
subsequent
treaty
made
with
the

on
the

this

the

these
it
may
be
said
this
tribe
the
stockbridges
for
of
the

there
probably
remain
not
more
than
half
a
dozen
formerly
an
intelligent
prosperous

not
a

behind
the

advanced
of

possessed

unfortunately
for

though
much
to
the
advantage
of

acquired
thereby
a
valuable
tract
of
country
for
white
settlement
they
removed
in
to
their

the
change
has
proved
highly
detrimental
to

prospects
their
new
reservation
the
greater
part
poor
in
soil
and
seriously
affected
by
wet
seasons
and
frequent
frosts
has
never
yielded
them
more
than
a
meagre
subsistence
many
have
for
this
reason
left
the
tribe
and
have
been
for
years
endeavoring
to
obtain
a
livelihood
among
the
whites
maintaining
but
little
intercourse
with
those
remaining
on
the
reservation
yet
still
holding
their
rights
in
the
tribal
property
the
result
has
been
bickerings
and
faction
quarrels
prejudicial
to
the
peace
and
advancement
of
the
community
more
than
of
the
present
membership
of
the

from
both
the
citizen
and
the
indian
parties
into
which
it
has
been
long
divided
are

to

themselves
of

referred
to

they
will
finally
receive
their

about
souls

rather
it

they

ultimately
occupy

known
as
the
white

and
red

reservations
containing
altogether
about
portion
of

is
very
valuable
for
its
pine

indians
reside
in
different
localities
most
of
them
are
on
their
reservation
at

others
are
at
mille

gull
lake
and
some
at
white
oak
point
reservations
upon
the
reservation
operations
have
been
quite
extensive
in
the
erection
of
shops
and
mills
and
in
breaking
ground
at
one
time
during
the
past
summer
there
was
a
prospect
of
an
abundant
yield
from
acres
sown
in
cereals
but
unfortunately
the
grasshoppers
swept
away
the
entire
crop
and
a
second
crop
of
buckwheat
and
turnips
proved
a
failure
the
indians
on
this
reservation
are
and
inclined
to
be
industrious
many
of
them
are
engaged
in
tilling
the
soil
while
others
are
learning
the
mechanical
arts
and
they
may
as
a
body
be
said
to
be
making
considerable
progress
in
the
pursuits
of
civilized
life
about
of
the
indians
at
gull
lake
have
been
removed
to
white
earth
the
remainder
are
opposed
to
removal
and
will
in
their
present
feeling
rather
forfeit
their
annuities
than
change
their
location
the
mille

chippewas
who
continue
to
occupy
the
lands
ceded
by
them
in
with
reservation
of
the
right
to
live
thereon
during
good
behavior
are
indisposed
to
leave
their
old
home
for
the
new
one
designed
for
them
on
the
white

reservation
only
about
have
thus
far
been
induced
to
remove
their
present
reservation
is
rich
in
pine
lands
the
envy
of
lumber
dealers
and
there
is
a
strong
pressure
on
all
sides
for
their
early
removal
they
should
have
help
from
the
government
whether
they
remain
or
remove
and
this
could
be
afforded
to
a
sufficient
extent
by
the
sale
for
their
benefit
of
the
timber
upon
the
lands
now
occupied
by
them
probably
the
government
could
provide
for
them
in
no
better
way
white
oak
point
were
formerly
known
as
sandy
lake
indians
they
were
removed
in
from
sandy
lake
and
rabbit
lake
to
white
oak
point
on
the
mississippi
near
the
eastern
part
of
the
leech
lake
reservation
this
location
is
unfavorable
to
their
moral
improvement
and
material
progress
from
its
proximity
to
the
lumber
camps
of
the
whites
thus
far
the
effort
made
to
better
their
condition
by
placing
them
on
farming
land
has
proved
a
failure
the
ground
broken
for
them
has
gone
back
into
grass
and
their
are
in
ruins
the
former
occupants
betaking
themselves
to
their
wonted
haunts
it
would
be
well
if
these
indians
could
be
induced
to
remove
to
the
white
earth
reservation
at
red
lake
the
indians
have
had
a
prosperous
year
good
crops
of
corn
and
potatoes
have
been
raised
and
a
number
of
houses
built
this
band
would
be
in
much
better
circumstances
were
they
possessed
of
a
greater
quantity
of
arable
lands
that
to
which
they
are
at
present
limited
allows
but
five
acres
suitable
for
that
use
to
each
family
it
is
proposed
to
sell
their
timber
and
with
the
proceeds
clear

purchase
stock
and
establish
a
school
bands
reside
in
dakota
territory
but
are
here
noticed
in
connection
with
the
minnesota

because
of
their
being
attached
to

they
have
no

ceded
their

by
treaty
made
in

some

of

then
made

lead
a
somewhat
nomadic

depending

with
an

from
the

of
the

with
the

now
being

with
the
earnest
endeavors
that
are
now
being
put
forth
by
their
agent
and
the
teachers
employed
especially
at
white

it
is
expected
that
their
interests
in
this
regard
will
be
greatly
promoted
at
white

school
operations
have
been
quite
successful
so
much
so
that
it
will
require
additional
accommodations
to
meet
the
demands
of
the
indians
for
the
education
of
their
children
the
only
other
school
in
operation
is
that

no

this
interest

too
small
to
be
of
any
benefit

some
action
should
be
taken
by
congress
with
a
view
of
having
all
business

earnestly
expressed
desire

brought
under
the
immediate
charge
of
the

its
wards
congress
by

approved
july
directed
that
the
secretary
of

should
cause
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
to
take
the
same
supervisory
charge
of
them
as
of
other
tribes
of
indians
but
this
practically
amounts
to
nothing
in
the
absence
of
means
to
carry
out
the
intention
of
the
law
with
any
beneficial
result
to
the
indians
the
condition
of
this
people
is
represented
to
be
deplorable

were
living
in
good
circumstances
engaged
with
all
the
success
which
could
be
expected

still
follow

extent
under

steps
are
being
taken
to
sell
acres
of
the
western
part

the

of
the

whom
they
have
been
always
more

has
tended
to
retard

they
are
however
gradually
becoming
more
habituated

the
whites
are
giving
some
attention
to
agriculture
and
with
the
disappearance
of

from
their
section
of

will
doubtless
settle
down
to
farming
and
to
the
practice
of

also

taken
from
that
part
of

reservation
lying
south

these
lands
are
now
being
surveyed

it
is
believed
that
with
the
proceeds
of
this
sale
such
improvements
in
the
way
of
building
houses
and
opening
and
stocking
farms
can
be
made
for
the

as
will
at
an
early
day
induce
them
to
give
their
entire

attention
to
industrial
pursuits
there
are
two
schools
in
operation
on

emigrated
many
years

from

near
the
tribe
of
iowas
hereafter
to
be
mentioned
they
number
at
the

diminishing

they
have
a

about
acres

the
part
of

purchased
for
them
from

most
of
it
is
excellent
land
but
they
have
never
to
any
considerable
extent
made
use
of
it
for
tillage
being
almost
hopelessly
disinclined
to
engage
in
labor
of
any
kind

depending
principally
for
their
subsistence
a
very
poor

upon
their

which
is
secured
to
them
by
the

and
amounts
to

have
consented
to
the

now
have
a
reservation
adjoining

of

missouri
containing
about
acres
they
belong
to
a
much
better
class
of
indians
than
their
neighbors
the

foxes
being
temperate
frugal
industrious
and
interested
in
the
education
of
their
children
they
were
thoroughly
loyal
during
the
late
rebellion

furnished
a

of
soldiers
to

many
of

are
good
farmers

as
a
tribe
they
are
generally
extending
their
agricultural
operations
improving
their
dwellings
and
adding
to
their
comforts
a
large
majority
of
the
tribe
are
anxious
to
have
their
reservation
allotted
in
severalty
and
inasmuch
as
they
are
not
inclined
to
remove
to
another
locality
it
would
seem
desirable
that
their
wishes
in
this
respect
should
be
complied

evinced

cut
off

their
fear

these
indians
once
famous
for
their
prowess
in
war
have
not
for
some
years
made
any
marked
improvement
upon
their
former
condition
still
they
have
accomplished
a
little
under
highly
adverse
circumstances
and
influences
in
the
way
of
opening
small
farms
and
in
building
houses
and
are
beginning
to
show
some
regard
for
their
women
by
relieving
them
of
the
burdens
and
labors
heretofore
required
of
them
there
is
hope
of
their
further
improvement
although
they
are
still
but
one
degree
removed
from
the

have
one
school
in

about

and

these
indians
even
the
best
of

have
given
small
signs
of
improvement
in
the
arts
of
life
and
substantially
the
whole
dealing
of
the
government
with
them
thus
far
has
been
in
the
way
of
supplying
their
necessities
for
food
and
clothing
with
a
view
to
keeping
them
upon
their
reservation
and
preventing
their
raiding
into
texas
with
the
citizens
of
which
state
they
were
for
many
years
before
their
present
establishment
on
terms
of
mutual
hatred
and
injury
some
individuals
and
bands
have
remained
quiet
and
peaceable
upon
their
reservation
evincing
a
disposition
to
learn
the
arts
of
life
to
engage
in
agriculture
and
to
have
their
children
instructed
in
letters
to
these
every
inducement
is
being
held
out
to
take
up
land
and
actively
commence
tilling
it
thus
far
they
have
under
cultivation
but
acres
which
have
produced
the
past
year
a
good
crop
of
corn
and
potatoes
the
wealth
of
these
tribes
consists
in
horses
and
mules
of
which
they
own
to
the
number
as
reported
by
their
agent
of
a
great
proportion
of
the
animals
notoriously
having
been
stolen
in
texas
however
it
may
be
said
in
a
word
of
these
indians
that
their
civilization
must
follow
their
submission
to
the
government
and
that
the
first
necessity
in
respect
to
them
is
a
wholesome
example
which
shall
inspire
fear
and
command
obedience
so
long
as
of
these
tribes
take
turns
at
raiding
into
texas
openly
and
boastfully
bringing
back
scalps
and
spoils
to
their
reservation
efforts
to
inspire
very
high
ideas
of
social
and
industrial
life
among
the
communities
of
which
the
raiders
form
so
large
a
part
will
presumably
result
in
failure
and
cheyennes
of
the
tribes
are
native
to
the
section
of
country
now
inhabited
by
them
the
arapahoes
number
at
the
present
time
and
the
cheyennes
by
the
treaty
of
made
with
these
indians
a
large
reservation
was
provided
for
them
bounded
on
the
north
by
kansas
on
the
east
by
the
arkansas
river
and
on
the
south
and
west
by
the
red
fork
of
the
arkansas
they
have
however
persisted
in
a
refusal
to
locate
on
this
reservation
and
another
tract
containing
acres
north
of
and
adjoining
the
kiowa
and
comanche
reservation
was
set
apart
for
them
by
executive
order
of
august
by
act
of
may
the
secretary
of
the
interior
was
authorized
to
negotiate
with
these
indians
for
the
relinquishment
of
their
claim
to
the
lands
ceded
to
them
by
the
said
treaty
and
to
give
them
in
lieu
thereof
a
sufficient
and
permanent
location
upon
lands
ceded
to
the
united
states
by
the
creeks
and
seminoles
in
treaties
made
with
them
in
negotiations
to
the
end
proposed
were
duly
entered
into
with
these
tribes
unitedly
but
in
the
course
of
such
negotiations
it
has
become
the
view
of
this
office
that
the
tribes
should
no
longer
be
associated
in
the
occupation
of
a
reservation
the
arapahoes
are
manifesting
an
increasing
disinclination
to
follow
farther
the
fortunes
of
the
cheyennes
and
crave
a
location
of
their
own
inasmuch
as
the
conduct
of
the
arapahoes
is
uniformly
good
and
their
disposition
to
make
industrial
improvement
very
decided
it
is
thought
that
they
should
now
be
separated
from
the
more
turbulent
cheyennes
and
given
a
place
where
they
may
carry
out
their
better
intentions
without
interruption
and
without
the
access
of
influences
tending
to
draw
their
young
men
away
to
folly
and
mischief
with
this
view
a
contract
made
subject
to
the
action
of
congress
was
entered
into
between
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
and
the
delegation
of
the
arapahoe
tribe
which
visited
washington
during
the
present
season
the
delegation
being
fully
empowered
thereto
by
the
tribe
by
which
the
arapahoes
relinquish
all
their
interest
in
the
reservation
granted
them
by
the
treaty
of
in
consideration
of
the
grant
of
a
reservation
between
the
north
fork
of
the
canadian
river
and
the
red
fork
of
the
arkansas
river
and
extending
from
a
point
ten
miles
east
of
the
to
near
the
meridian
of
west
longitude
should
this
adjustment
of
the
question
so
far
as
the
arapahoes
are
concerned
meet
the
approval
of
congress
separate
negotiations
will
be
entered
into
with
the
cheyennes
with
a
view
to
obtaining
their
relinquishment
of
the
reservation
of
and
their
location
on
some
vacant
tract
within
the
same
general
section
of
the
indian
territory
a
considerable
number
of
the
arapahoes
are
already
engaged
in
agriculture
though
at
a
disadvantage
and
when
the
question
of
their
reservation
shall
have
been
settled
it
is
confidently
believed
that
substantially
the
whole
body
of
this
tribe
will
turn
their
attention
to
the
cultivation
of
the
soil
two
schools
are
conducted
for
their
benefit
at
the
agency
having
an
attendance
of
scholars
of
the
cheyennes
confederated
with
the
arapahoes
the
reports
are
less
favorable
as
to
progress
made
in
industry
or
disposition
to
improve
their
condition
until
both
these
tribes
in
common
with
the
kiowas
and
comanches
were
engaged
in
hostilities
against
the
white
settlers
in
western
kansas
but
since
the
treaty
made
with
them
in
that
year
they
have
with
the
exception
of
one
small

of

the
most
are
content
to
live
upon

the
caddoes
rank
among
the
best
indians
of
the
continent
and
set
an
example
to
the
other
bands
affiliated
with
them
worthy
of
being
more
generally
followed
than
it
is
in
physique
and
in
the
virtues
of
chastity
temperance
and
industry
they
are
the
equals
of
many
white
communities
a
permanent
reservation
should
be
set
aside
for
the
indians
of
this

and
with
proper
assistance
they
would
doubtless
in
a
few
years
become
entirely
but
one
school
is
in
operation

an
attendance
of
eighteen
scholars

their

maintained
between

the
sioux
of
the

like
most
warfare
confined
to

it
causes
wonderfully
little
loss
of
to
disturb
the
condition
of
these
agencies

to
retard
the
progress
of
all
the
parties
concerned

be
moved
to

territory
south
of

where
the
mildness
of
the
climate

the
fertility
of

repay

labors

where
it
is
thought

their
willingness

labor

docility

they

in

the
question
of
their
removal

been
submitted

they
seem
inclined
to
favor
the
project
but
have
expressed
a
desire
to
send
a
delegation
of
their
chiefs
to
the
indian
territory
with
a
view
of
satisfying
themselves
as
to
the
desirableness
of

their
wishes
in

should
be
granted
early

may
be
effected

these
indians
although
removed
against
their
will
were
at
first
pleased
with
the
change
but
after
a
short
experience
of
their
new
home
became
dissatisfied
and
no
small
portion
left
the
reservation
to
roam
outside
disregarding
the
system
of
passes
established
they
bitterly
object
to
the
location
as
unhealthy
the
climate
being
severe
and
the
water
bad
there
is
undoubtedly
much
truth
in
these
complaints
they
ask
to
be
taken
back
to

their
own
home
promising
there
to
be

remove

but
all
efforts
to
this
end
have
thus
far
proved
futile
the
discontinuance
of

have
the
effect
to
cause
the

to
remove
either
to

to
the

now
located

generally
been

friendly
to
the
whites
recently
however
some
of
them
have
shown
a
disposition
to
be
troublesome
but
no
serious
difficulty
is
apprehended
none
of

appear
disposed
to
work
for

preferring
to

still
clearly
distinguished

the

found
them

they
are
so
described
by
spanish
historians
as
far
back
as
they
early
revolted
though
without
success
against
spanish
rule
and
in
the
struggle
many
of
their
towns
were
burnt
and
much
loss
of
life
and
property
occasioned
it
would
seem
however
that
in
addition
to
the
villagers
there
were
others
at
that
time
living
dispersed
whose
reduction
to
pueblos
was
determined
upon
and
made
the
subject

a
decree
by
charles

this

is
of
sufficient
extent
to
maintain
all

some

show
a

are
considerably
advanced
according
to

in

are
nearly
the
relations
of
these
bands
with
the
neighboring
whites
are
however
very
unfavorable
to
their
interests
and
the
condition
of
affairs
is
fast
growing
worse
the
difficulty
arises
out
of
the
fact
of
the
use
and
probably
the
improvident
use
by
the
whites
above
them
of
the
water
of
the
gila
river
by
which
they
are
deprived
of
all
means
of
irrigating
their
lands
much
dissatisfaction
is
manifested
on
this
account
and
the
result
is
so
far
that
many
of
the
indians
have
left
the
reservation
and
gone
to
salt
river
valley
where
they
are
making
a
living
by
tilling
the
soil
not
however
without
getting
into
trouble
at
this
point
also
with

indians

some
respects
as

they

many

christianity
and
they

generally
quiet

peaceable
they
manifest
a
strong
desire
to
have
their

educated
and
steps
to
this
end
have
been
taken
by
the

these
indians
have
no
treaty
relations
with

and
receive
no

from

the
expediency
of
assigning
to

papagoes
a
reservation
and
concentrating
them
where
they
can
be
brought
within
the
direct
care
and
control
of
the

is
under
consideration
by
the

there
seems
to
be
no
reason
to
doubt
that
if
so
established

supplied
with

stock
they

become

the

numerous
bands
confederated
under
the
title
of
yakamas
many
of
them
under
the
able
management
of
their
present
agent
have
become
noticeably
advanced
in
civilization
and
are
good
farmers
or
skilled
mechanics
the
school
at
the
yakama
agency
has
been
a
complete
success
and
of
incalculable
benefit
in
imparting
to
the
children
a
practical
knowledge
of
farming
and
of
the
different
mechanical
arts
their
principal
wealth
is
in
horses
of
which
they
own
the
fact
that
the
reservation
for
these
indians
is
located
east
of
the
cascade
mountains
away
from
all
contact
with
the
whites
has
doubtless
tended
in
a
great
measure
to
make
this
what
it
model
agency
on
the
pacific
slope
though
to
this
result
the
energy
and
devotion
of
agent
wilbur
have
greatly
contributed
churches
have
been
built
on
the
reservation
which
are
well
attended
the
services
being
conducted
by
native
preachers
there
are
at
present
two
schools
with
an
attendance
of
scholars
and
others
remnants
of

to
no

with

number
about
and
have
a
reservation
of
acres
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
territory
set
apart
for
them
by
executive
order
of
july
a
considerable
portion
of
the
land
in
this
reservation
is
excellent
for
agricultural
purposes
and
quite
extensive
crops
are
being
raised
by
the
indians
of
the
chehalis
tribe
none
of
the
other
tribes
for
whom
the
reservation
was
intended
reside
upon
it
declining
to
do
so
for
the
reason
that
they
do
not
recognize
it
as
their
own
and
fear
to
prejudice
their
claims
to
other
lands
by
so
doing
all
these
indians
have
horses
and
cattle
in
abundance
they
are
industrious
and
being
good
those
of
them
who
do
not
farm
on
their
own
account
find
ready
employment
from
the
surrounding
farmers
their
services
always
commanding
the
highest
wages
having
no
treaty
relations
with
the
government
no
direct
appropriations
are
made
for
their
benefit
they
however
receive
some
assistance
from
the
general
incidental
fund
of
the
territory
the
indians
herein
referred
to
as
not
living
upon
the
reservation
are
of
the
cowlitz
chinook
shoalwater
bay
and
humboldt
tribes
they
profess
to
desire
a
home
at
the
mouth
of
the
humboldt
and
coinoose
rivers
where
they
originated
and
other
indians
numbering
occupy
the
portion
of
the
territory
they
have
no
treaty
relations
with
the
government
and
until
the
present
year
have
had
no
reservation
set
apart
for
them
they
are
now
however
to
be
established
under
an
order
of
the
president
of
july
in
the
general
section
of
the
territory
where
they
now
are
upon
a
tract
which
is
bounded
on
the
south
and
east
by
the
columbia
river
on
the
west
by
the
okinakane
river
and
on
the
north
by
british
columbia
the
tribes
for
whom
this
reservation
is
designed
are
known
as
colvilles
okinakanes
san
poels
lake
spokanes
cœur
calispells
and
methows
some
of
these
indians
however
have
settled
upon
valuable
tracts
of
land
and
have
made
extensive
improvements
while
others
to
a
considerable
number
have
begun
farming
in
a
small
way
at
various
points
within
the
district
from
which
it
is
proposed
to
remove
their
respective
tribes
it
is
doubtful
whether
these
individuals
will
voluntarily
remove
to
the
reservation
referred
to
which
is
some
distance
west
of
their
present
location
it
is
proposed
therefore
to
allow
such
as
are
engaged
in
farming
to
remain
where
they
are
if
they
so
desire
owing
to
the
influx
of
whites
into
the
country
thus
claimed
or
occupied
by
these
indians
many
of
them
have
been
crowded
out
and
some
of
them
have
had
their
own
unquestionable
improvements
forcibly
wrested
from
them
this
for
a
time
during
the
past
summer
caused
considerable
trouble
and
serious
difficulties
were
apprehended
but
thus
far
peace
has
been
preserved
by
a
liberal
distribution
among
them
of
agricultural
implements
seeds
blankets
etc
no
funds
are
appropriated
specially
for
these
indians
such
supplies
and
presents
as
are
given
them
being
furnished
from
the
general
incidental
fund
of
the

residing

scotans
coosas
alseas
klamath
modocs
and
snakes
besides
numerous
other
small
bands
they
are

of
the
great
number
of
small
tribes
and

in
this
number
of
tribes
and
bands
parties
to
the
same
treaty
being
in
some
cases
as
high
as
ten
or
indians
will
be
treated
of
and
the
remarks
concerning
them
will
be
made
under
the
heads
of
the
agencies
at
which
they
are
respectively
located
tribes
located
at
this
agency
are
the
umatillas
cayuses
and
a
portion
of
the
and
number
they
have
a
reservation
of
acres
situated
in
the
part
of
the
state
set
apart
for
them
by
treaty
of
june
this
reservation
is
very
fertile
and
as
usual
in
such
cases
has
attracted
the
cupidity
of
the
whites
a
proposition
was
made
last
year
under
the
authority
of
congress
to
have
the
indians
take
land
in
severalty
or
sell
and
remove
to
some
other
reservation
the
indians
however
in
the
exercise
of
their
treaty
rights
refused
to
accede
to
this
proposition
these
indians
are
successfully
engaged
in
agricultural
operations
are
nearly
and
may
be
considered
comparatively
speaking
wealthy
it
is
gratifying
to
state
that
the
introduction
of
whiskey
by
whites
upon
this
reservation
and
its
sale
to
the
indians
has
during
the
last
year
received
a
decided
check
through
the
vigilance
of
agent
cornoyer
in
causing
the
arrest
and
trial
of
four
citizens
for
a
violation
of
the
law
in
this
respect
all
the
parties
charged
were
convicted
and
are
now
in
prison
this
is
especially
worthy
of
note
from
the
fact
that
it
is
always
exceedingly
difficult
to
obtain
convictions
for
such
dealing
with
indians
in
any
section
of
the
country
there
is
one
school
in

though
there
is

little
really
good
land
in
this

many
of
the
indians
by
reason
of
their
industry
have
succeeded
measurably
in
their
farming
operations
and
may
be
considered
as
in
morals
they
have
greatly
improved
so
that
polygamy
the
buying
and
selling
of
wives
gambling
and
drunkenness
have
ceased
to
be
common
among
them
as
in
the
past
there
are
some
however
who
are
disposed
to
wander
off
the
reservation
and
lead
a
vagabond
life
but
little
advancement
has
been
made
in
education

an

to
the
gratification

averse

recently
they
have
shown
more
disposition
to
follow
agriculture

traditionally
accustomed

rely
chiefly
upon
fish
for
food
many
already
have
their

well
fenced

stocked
with
good
comfortable
dwellings
and
erected
thereon
there
is
no
reason
why
they
should
not
in

become
a
thoroughly
prosperous
people
the
failure
to
make
allotments
of
land
in
severalty
for
which
surveys
were
commenced
in
has
been
a
source
of
much
uneasiness
to
the

has
tended
to
weaken

report
on
the
condition
and
needs
of
the
mission
indians
of
california

agents

jackson
and

kinney
to
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
colorado
springs
july
sir
compliance
with
our
instructions
bearing
dates
november
and
january
we
have
the
honor
to
submit
to
you
the
following
report
on
the
subject
of
the
mission
indians
in
southern
california
the
term
mission
indians
dates
back
over
one
hundred
years
to
the
time
of
the
franciscan
missions
in
california
it
then
included
all
indians
who
lived
in
the
mission
establishments
or
were
under
the
care
of
the
franciscan
fathers
very
naturally
the
term
has
continued
to
be
applied
to
the
descendants
of
those
indians
in
the
classification
of
the
indian
bureau
however
it
is
now
used
in
a
somewhat
restricted
sense
embracing
only
those
indians
living
in
the
three
southernmost
counties
of
california
and
known
as
serranos
cahuillas
san
luisenos
and
dieguinos
the
last
two
names
having
evidently
come
from
the
names
of
the
southernmost
two
missions
san
luis
rey
and
san
diego
a
census
taken
in
of
these
bands
gives
their
number
as
follows
serranos
cahuillas
san
luisenos
dieguinos
total
this
estimate
probably
falls
considerably
short
of
the
real
numbers
as
there
are
no
doubt
in
hiding
so
to
speak
in
remote
and
inaccessible
spots
many
individuals
families
or
even
villages
that
have
never
been
counted
these
indians
are
living
for
the
most
part
in
small
and
isolated
villages
some
on
reservations
set
apart
for
them
by
executive
order
some
on
government
land
not
reserved
and
some
upon
lands
included
within
the
boundaries
of
confirmed
mexican
grants
considerable
numbers
of
these
indians
are
also
to
be
found
on
the
outskirts
of
white
settlements
as
at
riverside
san
bernardino
or
in
the
colonies
in
the
san
gabriel
valley
where
they
live
like
gypsies
in
brush
huts
here
gone
eking
out
a
miserable
existence
by
days
works
the
wages
of
which
are
too
often
spent
for
whiskey
in
the
village
saloons
travellers
in
southern
california
who
have
formed
their
impressions
of
the
mission
indians
from
these
wretched
wayside
creatures
would
be
greatly
surprised
at
the
sight
of
some
of
the
indian
villages
in
the
mountain
valleys
where
freer
from
the
contaminating
influence
of
the
white
race
are
industrious
peaceable
communities
cultivating
ground
keeping
stock
carrying
on
their
own
simple
manufactures
of
pottery
mats
baskets
and
making
their
living
very
poor
living
it
is
true
but
they
are
independent
and
in
it
and
ask
nothing
at
the
hands
of
the
united
states
government
now
except
that
it
will
protect
them
in
the
ownership
of
their
lands
which
in
many
instances
have
been
in
continuous
occupation
and
cultivation
by
their
ancestors
for
over
one
hundred
years
from
tract
after
tract
of
such
lands
they
have
been
driven
out
year
by
year
by
the
white
settlers
of
the
country
until
they
can
retreat
no
farther
some
of
their
villages
being
literally
in
the
last
tillable
spot
on
the
desert
edge
or
in
mountain
fastnesses
yet
there
are
in
southern
california
many
fertile
valleys
which
only
thirty
years
ago
were
like
garden
spots
with
these
same
indians
orchards
and
vineyards
now
there
is
left
in
these
valleys
no
trace
of
the
indians
occupation
except
the
ruins
of
their
adobe
houses
in
some
instances
these
houses
still
standing
are
occupied
by
the
robber
whites
who
drove
them
out
the
responsibility
for
this
wrong
rests
perhaps
equally
divided
between
the
united
states
government
which
permitted
lands
thus
occupied
by
peaceful
agricultural
communities
to
be
put
in
market
and
the
white
men
who
were
not
restrained
either
by
humanity
or
by
a
sense
of
justice
from
filing
homestead
claims
on
lands
which
had
been
fenced
irrigated
tilled
and
lived
on
by
indians
for
many
generations
the
government
can
not
justify
this
neglect
on
the
plea
of
ignorance
repeatedly
in
the
course
of
the
last
thirty
years
both
the
regular
agents
in
charge
of
the
mission
indians
and
special
agents
sent
out
to
investigate
their
condition
have
made
to
the
indian
bureau
full
reports
setting
forth
these
facts
in
one
of
these
special
agents
giving
an
account
of
the
san
pasquale
indians
mentioned
the
fact
that
a
white
man
had
just
the
land
on
which
the
greater
part
of
the
village
was
situated
he
had
paid
the
price
of
the
land
to
the
register
of
the
district
land
office
and
was
daily
expecting
his
patent
from
washington
he
owned
the
agent
says
that
it
was
hard
to
wrest
from
these
and
industrious
creatures
the
homes
they
had
built
up
but
said
he
if
i
had
not
done
it
somebody
else
would
for
all
agree
that
the
indian
has
no
right
to
public
lands
this
san
pasquale
village
was
a
regularly
organized
indian
pueblo
formed
by
about
one
hundred
neophytes
of
the
san
luis
rey
mission
under
and
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
the
secularization
act
in
the
record
of
its
founding
is
preserved
in
the
mexican
archives
at
san
francisco
these
indians
had
herds
of
cattle
horses
and
sheep
they
raised
grains
and
had
orchards
and
vineyards
the
whole
valley
in
which
this
village
lay
was
at
one
time
set
off
by
executive
order
as
a
reservation
but
by
the
efforts
of
designing
men
the
order
was
speedily
revoked
and
no
sooner
has
this
been
done
than
the
process
of
dispossessing
the
indians
began
there
is
now
on
the
site
of
that
old
indian
pueblo
a
white
settlement
numbering
voters
the
indians
are
all
gone
to
other
villages
some
living
near
by
in
cañons
and
nooks
in
the
hills
from
which
on
the
occasional
visits
of
the
priest
they
gather
and
hold
services
in
the
adobe
chapel
built
by
them
in
the
days
of
their
prosperity
this
story
of
the
san
pasquale
indians
is
only
a
fair
showing
of
the
experiences
of
the
mission
indians
during
the
past
fifty
years
almost
without
exception
they
have
been
submissive
and
peaceable
through
it
all
and
have
retreated
again
and
again
to
new
refuges
in
a
few
instances
there
have
been
slight
insurrections
among
them
and
threatenings
of
retaliation
but
in
the
main
their
history
has
been
one
of
almost
incredible
long
suffering
and
patience
under
wrongs
in
one
of
the
san
luiseno
bands
the
aqua
caliente
indians
in
the
north
part
of
san
diego
county
made
an
attack
on
the
house
of
a
white
settler
and
there
was
for
a
time
great
fear
of
a
general
uprising
of
all
the
indians
in
the
country
it
is
probable
that
this
was
instigated
by
the
mexicans
and
that
there
was
a
concerted
plan
for
driving
the
americans
out
of
the
country
the
outbreak
was
easily
quelled
however
four
of
the
chiefs
were
tried
by
and
shot
by
order
of
general
heintzelman
and
in
january
of
the
following
year
a
treaty
was
made
with
the
san
luiseno
and
dieguino
indians
setting
off
for
them
large
tracts
of
land
this
treaty
was
made
by
a
united
states
commissioner
wozencraft
and
lieutenant
hamilton
representing
the
army
and
warner
the
settler
whose
house
had
been
attacked
the
greater
part
of
the
lands
which
were
by
this
treaty
assigned
to
the
indians
are
now
within
the
boundaries
of
grants
confirmed
and
patented
since
that
time
but
there
are
many
indian
villages
still
remaining
on
them
and
all
indians
living
on
such
lands
are
supposed
to
be
there
solely
on
the
tolerance
and
at
the
mercy
of
the
owners
of
said
ranches
and
to
be
liable
to
ejectment
by
law
whether
this
be
so
or
not
is
a
point
which
it
would
seem
to
be
wise
to
test
before
the
courts
it
is
certain
that
in
the
case
of
all
these
mission
indians
the
rights
involved
are
quite
different
from
and
superior
to
the
mere
occupancy
right
of
the
wild
and
uncivilized
indian
at
the
time
of
the
surrender
of
california
to
the
united
states
these
mission
indians
had
been
for
over
seventy
years
the
subjects
first
of
the
spanish
government
secondly
of
the
mexican
they
came
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
by
treaty
provisions
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo
between
the
united
states
and
mexico
in
at
this
time
they
were
so
far
civilized
that
they
had
become
the
chief
dependence
of
the
mexican
and
white
settlers
for
all
service
indoors
and
out
in
the
admirable
report
upon
these
indians
made
to
the
interior
department
in
by
the
hon
wilson
of
los
angeles
are
the
following
statements
these
same
indians
had
built
all
the
houses
in
the
country
planted
all
the
fields
and
vineyards
under
the
missions
there
were
masons
carpenters
plasterers
tanners
blacksmiths
millers
bakers
cooks
carters
and
weavers
and
spinners
saddlers
shepherds
agriculturalists
horticulturalists
vineros
vaqueros
in
a
word
they
filled
all
the
laborious
occupations
known
to
civilized
society
the
intentions
of
the
mexican
government
toward
these
indians
were
wise
and
humane
at
this
distance
of
time
and
in
face
of
the
melancholy
facts
of
the
indians
subsequent
history
it
is
painful
to
go
over
the
details
of
the
plans
devised
one
short
ago
for
their
benefit
in
there
were
in
the
missions
in
california
some
or
indians
living
comfortable
and
industrious
lives
under
the
control
of
the
franciscan
fathers
the
spanish
colonization
plan
had
from
the
outset
contemplated
the
turning
of
these
mission
establishments
into
pueblos
as
soon
as
the
indians
should
have
become
sufficiently
civilized
to
make
this
feasible
the
mexican
government
carrying
out
the
same
general
plan
issued
in
an
act
called
the
secularization
act
decreeing
that
this
change
should
be
made
this
act
provided
that
the
indians
should
have
assigned
to
them
cattle
horses
and
sheep
from
the
mission
herds
also
lands
for
cultivation
one
article
of
governor
figueroa
regulations
for
the
carrying
out
of
the
secularization
act
provided
that
there
should
be
given
to
every
head
of
a
family
and
to
all
above
years
of
age
though
they
had
no
family
a
lot
of
land
not
exceeding
varas
square
nor
less
than
there
was
also
to
be
given
to
them
in
common
enough
land
for
pasturing
and
watering
their
cattle
another
article
provided
that
the
cattle
of
each
mission
school
should
be
divided
among
the
indians
of
that
mission
in
a
proportionable
and
equitable
manner
also
of
the
chattels
instruments
seeds
restrictions
were
to
be
placed
on
the
disposition
of
this
property
the
indians
were
forbidden
to
sell
burden
or
alienate
under
any
pretext
the
lands
given
them
neither
can
they
sell
the
cattle
the
commissioners
charged
with
the
carrying
out
of
these
provisions
were
ordered
to
explain
all
the
arrangements
to
the
indians
with
suavity
and
patience
to
tell
them
that
the
lands
and
property
will
be
divided
among
them
so
that
each
one
may
work
maintain
and
govern
himself
without
dependence
on
any
one
it
was
also
provided
that
the
rancherias
villages
situated
at
a
distance
from
the
missions
and
containing
over
families
might
if
they
chose
form
separate
pueblos
and
the
distribution
of
lands
and
property
to
them
should
take
place
in
the
same
manner
provided
for
those
living
near
the
missions
these
provisions
were
in
no
case
faithfully
carried
out
the
administration
of
the
missions
vast
estates
and
property
was
too
great
a
temptation
for
human
nature
especially
in
a
time
of
revolution
and
misrule
the
history
of
the
thirteen
years
between
the
passing
of
the
secularization
act
and
the
conquest
of
california
is
a
record
of
shameful
fraud
and
pillage
of
which
the
indians
were
the
most
hapless
victims
instead
of
being
permitted
each
one
to
work
maintain
and
govern
himself
without
dependence
on
any
one
as
they
had
been
promised
their
rights
to
their
plats
of
land
were
in
the
majority
of
cases
ignored
they
were
forced
to
labor
on
the
mission
lands
like
slaves
in
many
instances
they
were
hired
out
in
gangs
to
cruel
masters
from
these
cruelties
and
oppressions
they
fled
by
hundreds
returning
to
their
old
wilderness
homes
those
who
remained
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
pueblos
became
constantly
more
and
more
demoralized
and
were
subjected
to
every
form
of
outrage
by
a
decree
of
the
los
angeles
aqumiento
about
the
time
of
our
taking
possession
of
california
all
indians
found
without
passes
either
from
the
alcalde
of
the
pueblos
in
which
they
lived
or
from
their
masters
significant
phrase
were
to
be
treated
as
and
enemies
at
this
time
there
were
according
to
wilson
report
whole
streets
in
los
angeles
where
every
other
house
was
a
for
indians
and
every
saturday
night
the
town
was
filled
with
indians
in
every
stage
of
intoxication
those
who
were
helpless
and
insensible
were
carried
to
the
jail
locked
up
and
on
monday
morning
bound
out
to
the
highest
bidders
at
the
jail
gates
the
indian
has
a
quick
sense
of
justice
says
wilson
he
can
never
see
why
he
is
sold
out
to
service
for
an
indefinite
period
for
intemperance
while
the
white
man
goes
unpunished
for
the
same
thing
and
the
very
richest
and
best
men
to
his
eye
are
such
as
tempt
him
to
drink
and
sometimes
will
pay
him
for
his
labor
in
no
other
way
even
the
sober
and
industrious
and
best
skilled
among
them
could
earn
but
little
it
having
become
a
custom
to
pay
an
indian
only
half
the
wages
of
a
white
man
from
this
brief
and
necessarily
fragmentary
sketch
of
the
position
and
state
of
the
mission
indians
under
the
mexican
government
at
the
time
of
the
surrender
of
california
to
the
united
states
it
will
be
seen
that
our
government
received
by
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo
a
legacy
of
a
singularly
helpless
race
in
a
singularly
anomalous
position
it
would
have
been
very
difficult
even
at
the
outset
to
devise
practicable
methods
of
dealing
justly
with
these
people
and
preserving
to
them
their
rights
but
with
every
year
of
our
neglect
the
difficulties
have
increased
and
the
wrongs
have
been
multiplied
until
now
it
is
humanly
speaking
impossible
to
render
to
them
full
measure
of
justice
all
that
is
left
in
our
power
is
to
make
them
some
atonement
fortunately
for
them
their
numbers
have
greatly
diminished
suffering
hunger
disease
and
vice
have
cut
down
more
than
half
of
their
numbers
in
the
last
thirty
years
but
the
remnant
is
worth
saving
setting
aside
all
question
of
their
claim
as
a
matter
of
atonement
for
injustice
done
they
are
deserving
of
help
on
their
own
merits
no
one
can
visit
their
settlements
such
as
aqua
caliente
saboba
cahuilla
valley
santa
ysabel
without
having
a
sentiment
of
respect
and
profound
sympathy
for
men
who
friendless
poor
without
protection
from
the
law
have
still
continued
to
work
planting
fencing
irrigating
building
houses
on
lands
from
which
long
experience
has
taught
them
that
the
white
man
can
drive
them
off
any
day
he
chooses
that
drunkenness
gambling
and
other
immoralities
are
sadly
prevalent
among
them
can
not
be
denied
but
the
only
wonder
is
that
so
many
remain
honest
and
virtuous
under
conditions
which
make
practically
null
and
void
for
them
most
of
the
motives
which
keep
white
men
honest
and
virtuous
having
thus
given
as
brief
a
presentation
as
possible
of
the
general
situation
and
nature
of
these
indians
we
will
proceed
to
state
what
to
the
best
of
our
judgment
are
the
steps
which
ought
to
be
taken
by
the
united
states
government
in
their
behalf
the
descriptions
of
the
most
important
villages
we
visited
and
the
detailed
accounts
of
circumstances
and
situations
on
which
our
suggestions
are
based
are
given
for
convenience
of
reference
in
separate
exhibits
the
first
and
most
essential
step
without
which
there
is
no
possibility
of
protecting
these
indians
or
doing
anything
intelligently
for
them
is
the
determining
resurveying
rounding
out
and
distinctly
marking
their
reservations
already
existing
the
only
way
of
having
this
done
accurately
and
honestly
is
to
have
it
done
by
a
surveyor
who
is
under
the
orders
and
constant
supervision
of
an
intelligent
and
honest
commissioner
not
by
an
independent
surveyor
who
runs
or
floats
reservation
lines
where
he
and
his
friends
or
interested
parties
choose
instead
of
where
the
purpose
of
the
united
states
government
looking
to
the
indians
interests
had
intended
there
have
been
too
many
surveys
of
indian
reservations
in
southern
california
of
this
sort
see
exhibits
c
h
i
j
all
the
reservations
made
in
that
comprises
nearly
all
now
laid
off
by
guess
by
the
surveyor
in
san
diego
on
an
imperfect
county
map
these
sections
thus
guessed
at
by
the
surveyor
were
reported
by
the
commissioner
to
the
interior
department
set
aside
by
executive
order
and
ordered
to
be
surveyed
when
the
actual
survey
came
to
be
made
it
was
discovered
that
in
the
majority
of
cases
the
indian
villages
intended
to
be
provided
for
were
outside
the
reservation
lines
and
that
the
greater
part
of
the
lands
set
apart
were
wholly
worthless
the
plats
of
these
reservations
are
in
the
office
at
san
francisco
on
each
of
them
was
marked
by
the
surveyor
an
additional
line
in
color
showing
what
tracts
ought
to
be
added
to
take
in
the
indian
villages
and
fields
so
far
as
we
could
learn
no
action
was
taken
in
regard
to
these
proposed
additions
the
reservation
lines
when
thus
defined
should
be
marked
plainly
and
conspicuously
by
monuments
and
stakes
leaving
no
room
for
doubt
a
plat
of
each
reservation
should
then
be
given
to
the
indians
living
on
it
it
was
pathetic
in
our
visits
to
village
after
village
to
hear
the
indians
request
reiterated
for
this
thing
a
paper
to
show
to
the
white
men
where
their
lands
were
every
fragment
of
writing
they
had
ever
received
which
could
by
any
possibility
bear
on
their
title
to
their
lands
they
had
carefully
preserved
old
tattered
orders
from
army
officers
thirty
years
back
orders
from
justices
of
the
peace
all
worthless
of
course
but
brought
forward
with
touching
earnestness
to
show
us
in
no
single
instance
had
the
reservation
lines
ever
been
pointed
out
to
them
one
band
the
sequan
indians
who
had
never
seen
any
agent
said
they
had
been
told
that
they
were
on
a
reservation
but
they
did
not
know
if
it
were
true
or
not
they
had
been
obliged
to
give
up
keeping
stock
because
they
could
not
find
any
place
where
the
whites
would
let
them
pasture
cattle
see

j
there
are
some
settlements
of
indians
on
government
lands
not
set
off
as
reservations
in
some
instances
not
surveyed
these
tracts
should
all
be
surveyed
their
boundaries
marked
and
the
lands
withdrawn
from
market
to
be
permanently
set
aside
for
the
indians
use
we
use
the
term
rounding
out
in
regard
to
these
reservations
chiefly
on
account
of
the
complication
which
results
from
their
being
in
some
cases
within
the
limit
of
railroad
grants
and
made
subsequent
to
those
grants
some
are
actually
within
the
limits
of
the
southern
pacific
railroad
grant
others
will
be
within
the
limits
of
the
texas
pacific
grant
should
that
be
confirmed
the
odd
sections
thus
belonging
to
the
railroads
should
be
secured
to
the
indians
there
are
also
a
few
claims
to
lands
within
reservation
boundaries
which
are
legal
on
account
of
their
having
been
made
before
the
reservations
were
set
off
these
should
be
extinguished
see
exhibit
o
all
white
settlers
now
on
reservations
should
be
removed
for
the
last
four
years
stray
settlers
have
been
going
in
upon
reservation
tracts
this
is
owing
to
the
lack
of
boundary
definitions
and
marks
as
aforesaid
also
to
the
failure
of
the
surveys
to
locate
the
reservations
so
as
to
take
in
all
the
ground
actually
occupied
by
indian
villages
thus
in
many
instances
the
indians
fields
and
settlements
have
been
wrested
from
them
and
they
in
their
turn
have
not
known
where
they
could
or
could
not
go
there
is
not
a
single
reservation
of
any
size
which
is
free
from
white
settlers
it
would
seem
that
agents
in
charge
of
these
indians
should
have
been
authoritatively
instructed
in
no
case
to
allow
squatters
to
settle
on
lands
known
to
be
within
reservation
lines
whether
they
were
occupied
by
indians
or
not
see
exhibits
h
i
o
the
amount
of
land
set
off
in
indian
reservations
in
southern
california
appears
by
the
record
to
be
very
large
but
the
proportion
of
it
which
is
really
available
is
very
small
san
diego
county
itself
is
desert
and
mountain
and
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
the
proportion
of
desert
and
mountain
in
the
reservation
is
even
larger
than
this
by
thus
resurveying
rounding
out
and
freeing
from
white
settlers
the
present
reservations
adding
to
them
all
government
lands
now
actually
in
occupation
by
indians
there
will
be
according
to
the
best
of
our
judgment
nearly
land
enough
for
the
accommodation
of
all
the
mission
indians
except
those
whose
settlements
are
on
grants
in
regard
to
this
latter
class
those
whose
villages
are
now
within
the
boundaries
of
confirmed
grants
the
government
has
to
choose
between
two
courses
of
action
to
remove
them
and
make
other
provision
for
them
or
to
uphold
and
defend
their
right
to
remain
where
they
are
in
support
of
the
latter
course
we
believe
a
strong
case
could
be
made
out
and
we
have
secured
from
one
of
the
ablest
firms
in
southern
california
a
written
legal
opinion
on
this
point
see
exhibit
a
it
seems
clear
that
this
contest
should
be
made
by
the
government
itself
it
is
impossible
for
these
and
ignorant
people
to
undertake
on
their
own
account
and
at
their
own
expense
the
legal
settlement
of
this
matter
it
would
be
foolish
to
advise
it
inhuman
to
expect
it
a
test
case
could
be
made
which
would
settle
the
question
for
all
see
exhibit
b
in
case
the
decision
be
favorable
to
the
indians
remaining
the
ranch
owners
should
then
be
called
on
to
mark
off
the
boundaries
of
the
indians
lands
according
to
the
california
state
law
covering
such
cases
see
exhibit
whether
the
lands
thus
reverting
to
the
indians
could
properly
be
considered
as
government
lands
or
not
would
be
a
question
to
be
determined
probably
the
surest
way
of
securing
them
for
the
indians
permanent
use
would
be
to
consider
them
as
such
and
have
them
defined
as
reservations
by
act
of
congress
and
this
brings
us
to
our
fourth
recommendation
which
is
that
all
these
indians
reservations
those
already
set
off
by
executive
order
and
all
new
ones
made
for
them
whether
of
government
lands
now
in
their
occupation
or
of
lands
which
may
be
hereafter
by
legal
process
reclaimed
for
them
from
the
grant
lands
on
which
they
are
now
living
be
patented
to
the
several
bands
occupying
them
the
united
states
to
hold
the
patent
in
trust
for
the
period
of
years
at
the
expiration
of
that
time
the
united
states
to
convey
the
same
by
patent
to
said
indians
as
has
been
done
for
the
omaha
indians
the
insecurity
of
reservations
made
merely
by
executive
order
is
apparent
and
is
already
sadly
illustrated
in
southern
california
by
the
history
of
the
san
pasquale
reservation
that
of
aqua
caliente
and
others
the
insecurity
of
reservations
set
apart
by
act
of
congress
is
only
a
degree
less
the
moment
it
becomes
the
interest
and
purpose
of
white
men
in
any
section
of
the
country
to
have
such
reservation
tracts
restored
to
the
public
domain
the
question
of
its
being
done
is
only
a
question
of
influence
and
time
it
is
sure
to
be
done
the
future
of
these
industrious
peaceable
agricultural
communities
ought
not
to
be
left
a
single
day
longer
than
is
necessary
dependent
on
such
chances
chances
which
are
always
against
and
never
for
indians
interests
in
the
matter
of
holding
lands
the
best
way
and
time
of
allotting
these
lands
to
them
in
severalty
must
be
left
to
the
decision
of
the
government
a
provision
being
incorporated
in
their
patent
to
provide
for
such
allotments
from
time
to
time
as
may
seem
desirable
and
agents
and
commissioners
being
instructed
to
keep
the
advantages
of
this
system
constantly
before
the
indians
minds
some
of
them
are
fit
for
it
now
and
earnestly
desire
it
but
the
majority
are
not
ready
for
it
the
communal
system
on
which
those
now
living
in
villages
use
their
lands
satisfies
them
and
is
apparently
administered
without
difficulty
it
is
precisely
the
same
system
as
that
on
which
the
pueblo
lands
were
cultivated
by
the
early
spanish
settlers
in
southern
california
they
agree
among
themselves
to
respect
each
other
right
of
occupancy
a
man
right
to
a
field
this
year
depending
on
his
having
cultivated
it
last
year
and
so
on
it
seems
not
to
occur
to
these
indians
that
land
is
a
thing
to
be
quarrelled
over
in
the
village
of
aqua
caliente
one
of
the
most
intelligent
of
the
young
men
was
so
anxious
to
show
us
his
fields
that
we
went
with
him
a
little
distance
outside
the
village
limits
to
see
them
he
had
some
eight
acres
in
grain
vine
and
fruit
trees
pointing
first
in
one
direction
then
in
another
he
indicated
the
places
where
his
ground
joined
other
men
ground
there
was
no
line
of
demarcation
whatever
except
it
chanced
to
be
a
difference
of
crops
we
said
to
him
alessandro
how
do
you
know
which
is
your
land
and
which
is
theirs
he
seemed
perplexed
and
replied
this
was
my
mother
land
we
have
always
had
it
but
we
persisted
suppose
one
of
these
other
men
should
want
more
land
and
should
take
a
piece
of
yours
he
could
was
all
the
reply
we
could
get
from
alessandro
and
it
was
plain
that
he
was
greatly
puzzled
by
the
suggestion
of
the
possibility
of
neighbors
trespassing
on
each
other
cultivated
fields
we
recommend
the
establishment
of
more
schools
at
least
two
more
are
immediately
needed
one
at
the
rincon
and
one
at
santa
ysabel
see
exhibits
g
as
the
reservations
are
gradually
cleared
defined
and
assured
for
the
indians
occupancy
hundreds
of
indians
who
are
now
roving
from
place
to
place
without
fixed
homes
will
undoubtedly
settle
down
in
the
villages
and
more
schools
will
be
needed
it
is
to
be
hoped
also
that
some
of
the
smaller
bands
will
unite
with
the
larger
ones
for
the
sake
of
the
advantages
of
the
school
and
other
advantages
of
a
larger
community
the
isolated
situation
of
many
of
the
smaller
settlements
is
now
an
insuperable
difficulty
in
the
way
of
providing
education
for
all
the
children
these
indians
are
all
keenly
alive
to
the
value
of
education
in
every
village
that
we
visited
we
were
urged
to
ask
the
government
to
give
them
a
school
in
one
they
insisted
upon
ranging
the
children
all
in
rows
that
we
might
see
for
ourselves
that
there
were
children
enough
to
justify
the
establishing
of
a
school
in
this
connection
we
would
suggest
that
if
a
boarding
and
industrial
school
similar
to
those
at
hampton
and
carlisle
could
be
established
in
southern
california
it
would
be
of
inestimable
value
and
would
provide
opportunities
for
many
children
who
owing
to
the
isolation
of
their
homes
could
not
be
reached
in
any
other
way
we
would
further
suggest
that
in
our
judgment
only
women
teachers
should
be
employed
in
these
isolated
indian
villages
there
is
a
great
laxity
of
morals
among
these
indians
and
in
the
wild
regions
where
their
villages
lie
the
unwritten
law
of
public
sentiment
which
in
more
civilized
communities
does
so
much
to
keep
men
virtuous
hardly
exists
therefore
the
post
of
teacher
in
these
schools
is
one
full
of
temptations
and
danger
to
a
man
see
exhibit
moreover
women
have
more
courage
and
missionary
spirit
sufficient
to
undertake
such
a
life
and
have
an
invaluable
influence
outside
their
they
go
familiarly
into
the
homes
and
are
really
educating
the
parents
as
well
as
the
children
in
a
way
which
is
not
within
the
power
of
any
man
however
earnest
and
devoted
he
may
be
we
would
also
suggest
that
great
good
might
be
accomplished
among
these
indians
by
some
form
of
itinerary
religious
and
educational
labor
among
them
in
the
list
of
assignments
of
indian
agencies
to
different
religious
denominations
as
given
in
the
report
of
the
indian
bureau
for
the
mission
agency
is
assigned
to
the
evangelical
lutheran
but
we
could
not
learn
that
this
denomination
had
done
any
work
among
them
so
far
as
the
mission
indians
have
any
religion
at
all
they
are
catholics
in
many
of
the
villages
are
adobe
chapels
built
in
the
time
of
the
missions
where
are
still
preserved
many
relics
of
the
mission
days
such
as
saints
images
kettles
in
these
chapels
on
the
occasions
of
the
priest
visits
the
indians
gather
in
great
numbers
women
sometimes
walking
two
days
journey
bringing
their
babies
on
their
backs
to
have
them
baptized
there
are
also
in
several
of
the
villages
old
indians
formerly
trained
at
the
missions
who
officiate
with
catholic
rites
at
funerals
and
on
sundays
repeat
parts
of
the
mass
as
these
indians
are
now
situated
in
isolated
settlements
so
far
apart
and
so
remote
from
civilized
centres
the
only
practicable
method
of
reaching
them
all
would
be
by
some
form
of
itinerary
labor
a
fervent
religious
and
practical
teacher
who
should
spend
his
time
in
going
from
village
to
village
remaining
in
each
a
few
days
or
weeks
as
the
case
might
be
would
sow
seed
which
would
not
cease
to
grow
during
the
intervals
of
his
absence
if
he
were
a
man
of
sound
and
knowledge
of
laws
of
life
fitted
to
instruct
the
indians
in
matters
of
hygiene
cleanliness
ventilation
and
in
a
few
of
the
simple
mechanical
arts
as
well
as
in
the
doctrines
of
religion
and
morality
he
would
do
more
for
the
real
good
of
these
people
at
present
than
can
be
accomplished
by
schools
the
suggestion
of
the
value
of
itinerary
labor
among
the
indians
leads
to
our
next
recommendation
which
we
consider
of
great
importance
that
it
should
be
made
the
duty
of
any
government
agent
in
charge
of
the
mission
indians
to
make
a
round
of
inspection
at
least
twice
a
year
visiting
each
village
or
settlement
however
small
in
no
other
way
can
anything
like
a
proper
supervision
of
these
interests
be
attained
this
proof
of
the
government
intention
to
keep
a
sharp
eye
on
all
that
might
occur
in
relation
to
the
indians
would
have
a
salutary
moral
effect
not
only
on
the
indians
but
on
the
white
settlers
in
their
neighborhood
it
would
also
afford
the
means
of
dealing
with
comparative
promptitude
with
the
difficulties
and
troubles
continually
arising
as
it
is
now
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
the
indians
feel
themselves
unprotected
and
neglected
and
the
white
settlers
feel
themselves
safe
in
trespassing
on
indians
property
or
persons
in
some
of
the
villages
where
claims
have
been
located
within
the
last
four
years
no
agent
has
ever
been
it
is
safe
to
say
that
had
an
agent
been
on
the
ground
each
year
with
the
proper
authority
to
take
efficient
measures
much
of
the
present
suffering
and
confusion
would
have
been
prevented
in
the
case
for
instance
of
the
los
coyotes
village
filed
on
a
few
months
ago
see
exhibit
f
there
was
no
reason
why
those
lands
should
not
have
been
set
apart
for
the
indians
long
ago
had
their
situation
been
understood
so
in
the
san
ysidro
case
and
others
the
whole
situation
of
an
agent
in
regard
to
the
mission
indians
is
totally
different
from
that
of
ordinary
agency
on
a
reservation
the
duties
of
an
indian
agent
on
a
reservation
may
be
onerous
but
they
are
in
a
sense
simple
his
indians
are
all
together
within
comparatively
narrow
limits
and
so
to
speak
under
his
hand
and
dependent
largely
on
the
government
the
mission
indians
on
the
contrary
are
scattered
in
isolated
settlements
thirty
forty
a
hundred
miles
away
from
the
agency
headquarters
many
of
them
in
regions
difficult
of
access
moreover
the
indians
are
in
the
main
and
independent
protection
or
oversight
worth
anything
to
them
can
only
be
given
by
a
systematic
method
of
frequent
visitation
what
is
true
in
this
respect
of
the
agent
work
is
if
possible
still
truer
of
the
physician
if
there
is
to
be
an
agency
physician
for
the
mission
indians
at
all
he
should
be
a
young
strong
energetic
man
who
is
both
able
and
willing
to
make
at
least
four
circuits
a
year
through
the
villages
and
who
will
hold
himself
bound
to
go
when
called
in
all
cases
of
epidemics
serious
illness
or
accidents
occurring
among
indians
within
one
day
journey
of
the
agency
headquarters
whatever
salary
it
is
necessary
to
pay
to
secure
such
service
as
this
should
be
paid
or
else
the
office
of
agency
physician
to
the
mission
indians
should
be
abolished
anything
less
than
this
is
a
farce
and
a
fraud
we
recommend
that
there
be
secured
the
appointment
of
a
lawyer
or
a
law
firm
in
los
angeles
to
act
as
special
united
states
attorney
in
all
cases
affecting
the
interests
of
these
indians
they
have
been
so
long
without
any
protection
from
the
law
that
outrages
and
depredations
upon
them
have
become
the
practice
in
all
white
communities
near
which
they
live
indians
stock
is
seized
corraled
and
held
for
fines
sometimes
shot
even
on
the
indians
own
reservations
or
in
the
public
domain
in
seasons
of
dearth
roving
stockmen
and
shepherds
drive
their
herds
and
flocks
into
indians
destroying
their
subsistence
for
a
whole
year
lands
occupied
by
indians
or
by
indian
villages
are
filed
on
for
homestead
entry
precisely
as
if
they
were
vacant
lands
this
has
been
more
than
once
done
without
the
indians
receiving
any
warning
until
the
sheriff
arrived
with
the
writ
for
their
ejectment
the
indians
own
lives
are
in
continual
danger
it
being
a
safe
thing
to
shoot
an
indian
at
any
time
when
only
indian
witnesses
are
present
see
exhibits
c
it
is
plain
that
all
such
cases
as
these
should
be
promptly
dealt
with
by
equal
means
one
of
the
greatest
difficulties
in
the
position
of
the
mission
indians
agent
is
that
in
all
such
cases
he
is
powerless
to
act
except
through
the
at
best
slow
and
hitherto
unsatisfactory
channel
of
reporting
to
the
interior
department
he
is
in
the
embarrassing
position
of
a
guardian
of
wards
with
property
and
property
rights
for
the
defence
of
which
he
is
unable
to
call
in
prompt
legal
assistance
in
instances
in
which
the
indians
themselves
have
endeavored
to
get
redress
through
the
courts
they
have
in
the
majority
of
the
shame
of
the
southern
california
bar
be
it
egregiously
cheated
they
are
as
helpless
as
children
in
the
hands
of
dishonest
unscrupulous
men
we
believe
that
the
mere
fact
of
there
being
such
a
united
states
legal
authority
near
at
hand
to
act
for
the
indians
would
in
a
short
time
after
a
few
effective
illustrations
of
its
power
do
away
with
the
greater
proportion
of
the
troubles
demanding
legal
interference
the
question
of
the
rights
of
indians
living
on
grant
lands
to
remain
there
will
if
the
department
decides
to
test
it
by
law
involve
some
litigation
as
it
will
no
doubt
be
contested
by
the
ranch
owners
but
this
point
once
settled
and
the
indians
secured
in
the
ownership
of
their
lands
a
very
few
years
will
see
the
end
of
any
special
need
of
litigation
in
their
behalf
we
recommend
in
this
connection
and
for
this
office
the
firm
of
brunson
wells
of
los
angeles
we
have
obtained
from
this
firm
a
clear
and
admirable
opinion
on
these
indians
right
to
their
present
homes
see
exhibit
a
and
we
know
them
to
be
of
high
standing
at
the
bar
and
to
have
a
humane
sympathy
for
indians
we
recommend
that
there
should
be
a
judicious
distribution
of
agricultural
implements
among
these
indians
no
village
should
be
omitted
wagons
harness
ploughs
spades
and
hoes
are
greatly
needed
it
is
surprising
to
see
what
some
of
these
villages
have
accomplished
with
next
to
no
implements
in
the
santa
ysabel
village
the
indians
had
three
hundred
acres
in
wheat
there
were
but
three
old
broken
ploughs
in
the
village
no
harness
and
no
wagon
see
exhibit
there
is
at
present
much
and
not
unfounded
sore
feeling
in
some
of
the
villages
which
have
thus
far
received
no
help
of
this
kind
while
others
of
the
villages
have
been
supplied
with
all
that
was
needed
there
should
always
be
provided
for
the
mission
indians
agency
a
small
fund
for
the
purchase
of
food
and
clothing
for
the
very
old
and
sick
in
times
of
especial
destitution
the
mission
indians
as
a
class
do
not
beg
they
are
and
choose
to
earn
their
living
they
will
endure
a
great
deal
before
they
will
ask
for
help
but
in
seasons
of
drought
or
when
their
little
crops
have
for
any
cause
failed
there
is
sometimes
great
distress
in
the
villages
last
winter
the
cahuillas
in
the
cahuilla
valley
see
exhibit
c
were
for
many
weeks
without
sufficient
food
the
teacher
of
their
school
repeatedly
begged
them
to
let
her
write
to
the
agent
for
help
but
they
refused
at
last
one
night
the
captain
and
two
of
the
head
men
came
to
her
room
and
said
she
might
write
they
could
no
longer
subdue
the
hunger
she
wrote
the
letter
the
next
morning
at
daylight
the
indians
were
at
her
door
again
they
had
reconsidered
it
they
said
and
they
would
not
beg
they
would
rather
starve
and
they
would
not
permit
her
to
send
the
letter
the
second
and
third
special
points
on
which
we
were
instructed
to
report
to
the
department
were
whether
there
still
remains
in
southern
california
any
government
land
suitable
for
an
indian
reservation
and
if
not
in
case
lands
must
be
bought
for
that
purpose
what
lands
can
be
most
advantageously
purchased
there
is
no
government
land
remaining
in
southern
california
in
blocks
of
any
size
suitable
for
either
white
or
indian
occupancy
the
reason
that
the
isolated
little
settlements
of
indians
are
being
now
so
infringed
upon
and
seized
even
at
the
edge
and
in
stony
fastnesses
of
mountains
is
that
all
the
good
lands
with
water
or
upon
which
water
can
be
taken
up
we
recommend
two
purchases
of
land
positively
the
other
contingently
the
first
is
the
pauma
ranch
now
owned
by
bishop
mora
of
los
angeles
see
exhibit
this
ranch
lying
as
it
does
between
the
rincon
and
pala
reservations
on
the
north
and
south
and
adjoining
the
la
jolla
reservation
affords
an
admirable
opportunity
to
consolidate
a
large
block
of
land
for
indian
occupancy
it
is
now
in
our
opinion
a
desirable
tract
while
it
is
largely
hilly
and
mountainous
there
is
considerable
good
sheep
and
cattle
pasturing
on
it
and
a
fair
amount
of
bottom
land
for
cultivation
along
the
river
the
price
asked
for
it
is
as
lands
are
now
selling
in
southern
california
low
if
the
already
existing
reservations
are
cleared
of
whites
unified
and
made
ready
for
indian
occupancy
and
the
government
lands
now
in
actual
occupation
by
indians
be
assured
to
them
the
addition
of
this
pauma
ranch
will
be
in
our
opinion
all
that
will
be
required
to
make
comfortable
provision
for
all
the
indians
except
those
living
within
the
boundaries
of
confirmed
grants
should
the
department
decide
to
remove
all
these
and
provide
them
with
new
homes
we
recommend
the
purchase
of
the
santa
ysabel
ranch
see
exhibit
q
the
purchase
of
this
ranch
for
an
indian
reservation
was
recommended
to
the
government
some
years
ago
but
it
was
rejected
on
account
of
the
excessive
price
asked
for
it
it
is
now
offered
to
the
government
for
during
the
past
ten
years
the
value
of
lands
in
southern
california
has
in
many
places
quadrupled
in
some
it
is
worth
more
than
twenty
times
what
it
was
then
we
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
that
it
is
not
now
possible
to
buy
an
equally
suitable
tract
for
any
less
money
the
ranch
contains
acres
is
within
the
rain
belt
of
san
diego
county
is
well
watered
and
although
it
is
largely
mountainous
has
good
pasture
some
meadow
land
and
some
oak
timber
it
is
moreover
in
the
region
to
which
the
greater
proportion
of
these
indians
are
warmly
attached
and
in
the
vicinity
of
which
most
of
them
are
now
living
one
large
indian
village
is
on
the
ranch
see
exhibit
father
ubach
the
catholic
priest
of
san
diego
who
has
known
these
indians
for
seventeen
years
says
of
it
it
is
the
only
tract
to
which
human
power
can
force
these
indians
to
remove
we
recommend
this
purchase
only
as
a
last
resort
in
the
event
of
the
department
being
compelled
to
provide
new
homes
for
all
the
indians
now
living
within
the
boundaries
of
confirmed
grants
in
conclusion
we
would
make
the
suggestion
that
there
are
several
small
bands
of
mission
indians
north
of
the
boundaries
of
the
mission
indians
agency
for
whom
it
would
seem
to
be
the
duty
of
the
government
to
care
as
well
as
for
those
already
enumerated
one
of
these
is
the
san
carlos
indians
living
near
the
old
san
carlos
mission
at
monterey
there
are
nearly
one
hundred
of
these
and
they
are
living
on
lands
which
were
given
to
them
before
the
secularization
act
in
these
lands
are
close
to
the
boundaries
of
the
ranch
san
francisquito
of
monterey
these
boundaries
have
been
three
times
extended
each
time
taking
in
a
few
more
acres
of
the
indians
lands
until
now
they
have
only
ten
or
twelve
acres
left
there
are
also
some
very
destitute
indians
living
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
san
antonio
mission
some
sixty
miles
south
of
monterey
and
of
san
miguel
forty
miles
farther
south
and
of
santa
juez
near
santa
barbara
these
indians
should
not
be
overlooked
in
arrangements
made
for
the
final
establishing
of
the
mission
indians
in
southern
california
hoping
that
these
recommendations
may
be
approved
by
the
department

for

thereon
we
have
the
honor
to
submit
the

as
our
reply
and
answer
to
the
above
interrogatories
before
and
at
the
date
of

hidalgo
all
the
territory
now
known
as

a
part
of

under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
mexican
republic
we
do
not
regard
it
as
necessary
in

to
answer
the
questions
propounded
to
give
a
history
of
the
of

nor
the

on
august
the
mexican
congress
enacted
a
general
colonization
law
prescribing
the
mode
of

lands
throughout

this
law
was
limited
and
defined
by
a
series
of
regulations
ordained
by
the
mexican
government
november
by
these
laws
and
regulations
which
have
ever

without

out
in

question

are
contained

in

this
is
a
question
beset
and
surrounded
by
many
difficulties
nor
do
we
deem
it
necessary
to
do
more
than
refer
to
restrictions
and
limitations
contained
in
the
laws
of
mexico
concerning
private
grants
of
lands
upon
which
indians
were
residing
which
were
occupied
by
them
it
is
certain
that
if
such
lands
were
granted
by
a
mexican
official
and
the
authorities
omitted
to
recite
the
conditions
and
limitations
required
by

and
reserve
from
the
operation
of
such
grant
such
lands
as
the
law
conditioned
could
not
be
conveyed
by
such
grant
such
a
grant
would
and
could
not
take
it
out
of
the
operation
of
the
law
it
could
not
defeat
the
rights
of
those
whose
rights
attached
by
reason
of
law
if
the
officers
of
the
mexican
government
to
whom
was
confided
the
trust
exceeded
their
authority
as
regulated
by
the
solemnities
and
formalities
of
the
law
the
courts
are
bound
to
take
notice
of
it
and
can
not
shield
those
claiming
under
such
title
from
the
necessary
consequence
of
ignorance
carelessness
or
arbitrary
assumption

it
is
now
necessary
to
inquire
how
far
and
to
what
extent
will
the

change
or
modify
this

the

of

that
a

can
not
be
attached
collaterally

may
be
by

did
not
regard
these

in

the
question

not
affect

were
residing

occupying

within

which
grants
have
no
conditions

that

by
virtue

laws

this
evidence
with
such
other
evidence
as
we
understand
can
be
furnished
is
in
our
opinion
enough
to
establish
under
the
law
as
we
regard
it
a
right
in
the
indians
to
hold
and
occupy
such
lands
against
the
confirmee
or
patentee
if
however
no
such

has
been
made
we
are
of
the
opinion

conclusive
evidence
can

furnished
proving
that
these
indians
were
in
possession
of
these
lands
at
the
time
these
grants
were
made
by
the
mexican
authorities
that
they
continued
in
possession
and
were
in
possession
at
the
date
of
the
treaty
and
have
since
continued
in
possession
the
law
will
entitle
them
to
hold
such
land
against
all
persons
claiming

answer

second
question

the

it

provided

saboba
is
the
name
of
a
village
of
indians
of
the
serrano
tribe
one
hundred
and
in
number
living
in
the
san
jacinto
valley
at
the
base
of
the
san
jacinto
mountains
in
san
diego
county
the
village
is
within
the
boundaries
of
a
mexican
grant
patented
to
the
heirs
of
estudillo
january
the
greater
part
of
the
grant
has
been
sold
to
a
company
which
in
dividing
up
its
lands
allotted
the
tract
where
the
saboba
village
lies
to
one
byrnes
of
san
bernardino
who
proposes
to
eject
the
indians
unless
the
united
states
government
will
buy
his
whole
tract
of
seven
hundred
acres
at
an
exorbitant
price
the
saboba
village
occupies
about
two
hundred
acres
the
best
part
of
byrnes
tract
the
indians
have
lived
in
the
place
for
over
a
hundred
years
they
have
adobe
houses
fenced
fields
and
orchards
and
irrigating
ditches
there
is
in
the
village
a
spring
with
a
flow
of
about
miner
inches
it
is
claimed
by
the
indians
that
the
first
surveys
did
not
take
in
their
village
this
is
probably
true
the
resurveying
of
grants
and
floating
their
lines
so
as
to
take
in
lands
newly
discovered
to
be
of
value
and
leave
out
others
discovered
to
be
worthless
being
a
common
practice
in
california
in
a
country
where
water
is
gold
such
a
spring
as
these
saboba
indians
owned
could
not
long
escape
notice
or
be
left
long
in
the
undisturbed
possession
of
indians
these
indians
support
themselves
now
and
have
always
done
so
by
farming
and
by
going
out
in
organized
bands
as
and
vintagers
they
are
industrious
and
peaceable
and
make
in
good
seasons
a
fairly
comfortable
living
they
formerly
kept
stock
but
since
the
new
occupancy
allotting
and
fencing
of
the
valley
have
been
obliged
to
give
it
up
there
is
a
government
school
in
this
village
numbering
from
thirty
to
forty
pupils
who
have
made
remarkable
progress
in
their
studies
the
school
is
taught
by
a
pennsylvania
lady
formerly
a
teacher
of
the
freedmen
her
gentleness
and
refinement
have
exerted
an
influence
all
through
the
village
and
her
labors
among
the
people
in
times
of
sickness
and
suffering
have
been
the
work
of
a
missionary
rather
than
of
a

the
following
letters
were
written
by
two
of
the
children
in
this
school
both
under
fourteen
years
of
age
they
were
written
without

knowledge

dear

wish
to
write
a
letter
for
you
and
i
will
try
to
tell
you
some
things
the
white
people
call
san
jacinto
rancho
their
land
and
i
do
want
them
to
do
it
we
think
it
is
ours
for
god
gave
it
to
us
first
now
i
think
you
will
tell
me
what
is
right
for
you
have
been
so
good
to
us
giving
us
a
school
and
helping
us
will
you
not
come
to
san
jacinto
some
time
to
see
us
the
school
and
the
people
of
saboba
village
many
of
the
people
are
sick
and
some
have
died
we
are
so
poor
that
we
have
not
enough
good
food
for
the
sick
and
sometimes
i
am
afraid
that
we
are
all
going
to
die
will
you
please
tell
what
is
good
about
our
ranches
and
come
soon
to
see
us
your
friend
ramon
cavavi
my
dear
friend
wish
to
write
you
a
letter
about
the
american
people
that
want
to
drive
us
away
from
our
own
village
of
saboba
i
do
know
what
they
can
be
about
i
do
know
why
they
do
so
my
teacher
told
me
she
was
very
sorry
about
the
town
and
then
my
teacher
said
i
think
they
will
find
a
good
place
for
you
if
you
have
to
go
but
i
do
hope
they
will
not
drive
you
away
then
it
will
be
very
good
for
all
the
people
of
saboba
it
is
a
very
good
town
for
the
people
they
have
all
the
work
done
on
their
gardens
and
they
are
very
sorry
about
the
work
that
is
done
my
work
is
very
nicely
done
also
the
people
are
making
one
big
fence
to
keep
the
cows
and
the
horses
off
their
garden
your
true
friend
antonio
leon
these
saboba
indians
are
greatly
dispirited
and
disheartened
at
the
prospect
of
being
driven
out
of
their
homes
and
feel
that
the
government
ought
to
protect
them
the
captain
of
the
village
a
very
sensible
and
man
said
if
the
government
says
we
must
go
we
must
but
we
would
rather
die
right
here
than
move
the
right
of
these
indians
to
the
tract
they
have
so
long
occupied
and
cultivated
is
beyond
question
that
this
right
could
be
successfully
maintained
in
the
courts
is
the
opinion
of
the
law
firm
of
brunson
wells
whose
admirable
paper
covering
all
cases
of
this
kind
is
given
herewith
see
exhibit
we
found
three
miles
from
this
village
on
government
land
a
narrow
cañon
called
indian
cañon
in
which
half
a
dozen
indian
families
were
living
the
cañon
is
but
five
or
six
miles
long
and
very
narrow
but
it
has
a
small
brook
in
it
and
some
good
bottom
land
on
which
the
indians
had
excellent
wheat
crops
growing
the
sides
of
it
are
moderately
well
wooded
it
was
surprising
that
so
desirable
a
nook
had
been
overlooked
or
omitted
by
the
surveyors
of
the
san
jacinto
ranch
we
wrote
to
the
department
immediately
recommending
its
being
set
aside
for
indians
use
in
another
beautiful
cañon
also
with
a
stream
running
through
it
we
found
living
the
old
chief
victoriano
nearly
one
hundred
years
old
the
spot
was
an
oasis
of
green
oak
and
willow
trees
a
wheat
field
and
apricot
orchard
and
vineyard
the
latter
planted
by
victoriano
father
this
place
has
been
given
by
victoriano
to
his
grandson
who
we
were
told
is
taking
steps
to
secure
it
to
himself
under
the
indian
homestead
act
exhibit
the
cahuilla
reservation
the
cahuilla
valley
is
about
forty
miles
from
saboba
high
up
among
the
peaks
and
spurs
of
the
san
jacinto
mountains
a
wild
barren
inaccessible
spot
the
cahuilla
village
situated
here
was
one
of
the
most
interesting
that
we
visited
and
the
indians
seemed
a
more
individual
and
independent
people
than
any
other
we
saw
this
is
partly
due
to
their
native
qualities
the
tribe
having
been
originally
one
of
the
most
warlike
and
powerful
in
the
country
as
is
indicated
by
their
name
which
signifies
master
the
isolation
of
this
village
has
also
tended
to
keep
these
indians
and
independent
there
is
no
white
settlement
within
ten
miles
there
being
comparatively
little
to
tempt
white
men
into
these
the
population
of
the
village
numbers
from
one
hundred
and
fifty
to
two
hundred
the
houses
are
of
adobe
thatched
with
reeds
three
of
the
houses
have
shingled
roofs
and
one
has
the
luxury
of
a
floor
these
indians
make
the
greater
part
of
their
living
by
they
also
send
out
a
band
each
year
they
have
sixteen
fields
large
and
small
under
cultivation
and
said
they
would
have
had
many
more
except
for
the
lack
of
ploughs
there
being
but
one
plough
for
the
whole
village
they
raise
wheat
barley
corn
squashes
and
watermelons
sometimes
the
frost
kills
the
corn
and
occasionally
the
grasshoppers
descend
on
the
valley
but
aside
from
these
accidents
their
crops
do
well
all
through
the
village
were
to
be
seen
their
curious
outdoor
baskets
made
of
twisted
and
woven
twigs
and
set
up
on
poles
the
women
were
neatly
dressed
the
children
especially
so
and
the
faces
of
all
men
women
and
children
had
an
animation
and
look
of
intellectual
keenness
very
uncommon
among
the
southern
california
indians
on
the
outskirts
of
the
village
is
a
hot
spring
in
this
water
the
indians
old
and
young
are
said
to
be
continually
bathing
it
was
the
indians
impression
that
the
lines
of
their
reservation
ran
directly
through
the
centre
of
this
hot
spring
they
had
been
told
so
by
some
white
men
but
they
know
nothing
certainly
the
lines
had
never
been
shown
to
them
on
subsequent
examination
at
the
office
in
san
francisco
we
discovered
that
this
spring
and
the
village
itself
are
entirely
outside
the
reservation
lines
also
that
another
indian
settlement
called
duasno
a
few
miles
distant
and
intended
to
have
been
included
in
the
reservation
is
outside
the
lines
the
cahuilla
reservation
stands
recorded
as
containing
sections
of
land
so
far
as
we
could
judge
of
the
region
it
seemed
to
us
a
generous
estimate
to
say
that
there
might
be
possibly
five
hundred
acres
of
cultivatable
land
in
it
in
good
years
there
would
be
considerable
pasturage
on
the
sides
of
the
mountains
but
far
the
greater
part
of
the
tract
is
absolutely
worthless
being
bare
and
stony
mountains
the
cahuillas
however
are
satisfied
with
it
they
love
the
country
and
would
not
exchange
it
for
fertile
valleys
below
they
said
that
they
would
be
perfectly
contented
if
the
government
would
only
mark
their
land
off
for
them
and
set
up
boundaries
so
that
they
could
know
where
they
might
keep
their
own
stock
and
keep
the
white
men
stock
out
all
they
asked
for
in
addition
to
this
was
some
harnesses
wagons
and
agricultural
implements
especially
ploughs
of
these
last
the
captain
reiterated
and
was
not
satisfied
till
he
saw
the
figures
written
down
that
ten
was
the
smallest
number
that
would
be
sufficient
for
the
village
a
few
rods
from
the
hot
spring
there
stood
a
good
adobe
house
shut
up
unoccupied
the
history
of
this
house
is
worth
telling
as
an
illustration
of
the
sort
of
troubles
to
which
indians
in
these
remote
regions
unprotected
by
the
government
and
unable
to
protect
themselves
are
exposed
some
eight
years
ago
the
cahuillas
rented
a
tract
of
their
land
as
pasture
to
two
mexicans
named
machado
these
machados
by
permission
of
the
indians
built
this
adobe
house
and
lived
in
it
when
looking
after
their
stock
at
the
expiration
of
the
lease
the
house
was
to
be
the
property
of
the
indians
when
the
machados
left
they
said
to
the
cahuilla
captain
here
is
your
house
the
next
year
another
man
named
thomas
rented
a
pasture
tract
from
the
indians
and
also
rented
this
house
paying
for
the
use
of
it
for
two
years
six
bulls
and
putting
into
it
a
man
named
cushman
who
was
his
overseer
at
the
end
of
the
two
years
thomas
said
to
the
cahuillas
here
is
your
house
i
now
take
my
cattle
away
but
the
man
cushman
refused
to
move
out
of
the
house
said
it
was
on
railroad
land
which
he
had
bought
of
the
railroad
company
in
spite
of
the
indians
remonstrances
he
lived
on
there
for
three
or
four
years
finally
he
died
after
his
death
his
old
employer
thomas
who
had
once
rented
this
very
house
from
the
indians
came
forward
claimed
it
as
his
own
and
has
now
sold
it
to
a
man
named
parks
through
all
this
time
the
indians
committed
no
violence
on
the
trespassers
they
journeyed
to
los
angeles
to
find
out
from
the
railroad
company
whether
cushman
owned
the
land
as
he
said
and
were
told
that
he
did
not
they
laid
the
matter
before
their
agent
but
he
was
unable
to
do
anything
about
it
it
would
seem
of
the
greatest
importance
in
the
case
of
this
reservation
and
of
all
others
similarly
placed
that
the
odd
section
claimed
or
owned
by
the
railroad
companies
should
be
secured
and
added
to
the
permanent
reservation
much
further
trouble
will
in
this
way
be
saved
an
incident
which
had
occurred
on
the
boundaries
of
the
cahuilla
reservation
a
few
weeks
before
our
arrival
there
is
of
importance
as
an
illustration
of
the
need
of
some
legal
protection
for
the
indians
in
southern
california
a
cahuilla
indian
named
juan
diego
had
built
for
himself
a
house
and
cultivated
a
small
patch
of
ground
on
a
high
mountain
ledge
a
few
miles
north
of
the
village
here
he
lived
alone
with
his
wife
and
baby
he
had
been
for
some
years
what
the
indians
call
a
locoed
indian
being
at
times
crazy
never
dangerous
but
yet
certainly
insane
for
longer
or
shorter
periods
his
condition
was
known
to
the
agent
who
told
us
that
he
had
feared
he
would
be
obliged
to
shut
juan
up
if
he
did
not
get
better
it
was
also
well
known
throughout
the
neighboring
country
as
we
found
on
repeated
inquiry
everybody
knew
that
juan
diego
was
locoed
this
expression
comes
from
the
effect
a
weed
of
that
name
has
upon
horses
making
them
wild
and
unmanageable
juan
diego
had
been
off
to
find
work
at
he
came
home
at
night
riding
a
strange
horse
his
wife
exclaimed
why
whose
horse
is
that
juan
looked
at
the
horse
and
replied
confusedly
where
is
my
horse
then
the
woman
much
frightened
said
you
must
take
that
horse
right
back
they
will
say
you
stole
it
juan
replied
that
he
would
as
soon
as
he
had
rested
threw
himself
down
and
fell
asleep
from
this
sleep
he
was
awakened
by
the
barking
of
the
dogs
and
ran
out
of
the
house
to
see
what
it
meant
the
woman
followed
and
was
the
only
witness
of
what
then
occurred
a
white
man
named
temple
the
owner
of
the
horse
which
juan
had
ridden
home
rode
up
and
on
seeing
juan
poured
out
a
volley
of
oaths
levelled
his
gun
and
shot
him
dead
after
juan
had
fallen
on
the
ground
temple
rode
closer
and
fired
three
more
shots
in
the
body
one
in
the
forehead
one
in
the
cheek
and
one
in
the
wrist
the
woman
looking
on
he
then
took
his
horse
which
was
standing
tied
in
front
of
the
house
and
rode
away
the
woman
with
her
baby
on
her
back
ran
to
the
cahuilla
village
and
told
what
had
happened
this
was
in
the
night
at
dawn
the
indians
went
over
to
the
place
brought
the
murdered
man
body
to
the
village
and
buried
it
the
excitement
was
intense
the
teacher
in
giving
us
an
account
of
the
affair
said
that
for
a
few
days
she
feared
she
would
be
obliged
to
close
her
school
and
leave
the
village
the
murderer
went
to
the
nearest
justice
of
the
peace
and
gave
himself
up
saying
that
he
had
in
shot
an
indian
he
swore
that
the
indian
ran
towards
him
with
a
knife
a
jury
of
twelve
men
was
summoned
who
visited
the
spot
listened
to
story
pronounced
him
guiltless
and
the
judge
so
decided
the
testimony
was
not
taken
it
would
have
been
worthless
if
it
had
been
so
far
as
influencing
that
jury
minds
was
concerned
her
statement
was
positive
that
juan
had
no
knife
nor
weapon
of
any
kind
sprang
up
from
his
sleep
and
ran
out
hastily
to
see
what
had
happened
and
was
shot
almost
as
soon
as
he
had
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
door
the
district
attorney
in
san
diego
on
being
informed
by
us
of
the
facts
in
the
case
reluctantly
admitted
that
there
would
be
no
use
whatever
in
bringing
a
white
man
to
trial
for
murder
of
an
indian
under
such
circumstances
with
only
indian
testimony
to
convict
him
this
was
corroborated
and
the
general
animus
of
public
feeling
vividly
illustrated
to
us
by
a
conversation
we
had
later
with
one
of
the
jurors
in
the
case
a
fine
manly
young
fellow
far
superior
in
education
and
social
standing
to
the
average
southern
california
ranchman
he
not
only
justified
temple
killing
the
indian
but
said
he
would
have
done
the
same
thing
himself
i
do
care
whether
the
indian
had
a
knife
or
not
he
said
that
did
cut
any
figure
at
all
the
way
i
looked
at
it
any
man
that
take
a
horse
of
mine
and
ride
him
up
that
mountain
trail
i
shoot
him
whenever
i
found
him
stockmen
have
just
got
to
protect
themselves
in
this
country
the
fact
that
juan
had
left
his
own
horse
a
one
in
the
corral
from
which
he
had
taken
temple
that
he
had
ridden
the
straight
trail
to
his
own
door
and
left
the
horse
tied
in
front
of
it
thus
making
it
certain
that
he
would
be
tracked
and
caught
weighed
nothing
in
this
young
man
mind
the
utmost
concession
that
he
would
make
was
finally
to
say
well
i
agree
that
temple
was
to
blame
for
firin
into
him
after
he
was
dead
that
was
mean
i
allow
the
account
of
our
visit
to
the
cahuilla
reservation
would
be
incomplete
without
a
brief
description
of
the
school
there
it
numbers
from
forty
to
fifty
scholars
and
is
taught
by
a
widow
who
with
her
little
daughter
ten
years
of
age
lives
in
one
small
room
built
on
at
the
end
of
the
part
of
the
room
is
curtained
off
into
a
recess
holding
bed
washstand
and
bureau
the
rest
of
the
room
is
a
kitchen
and
barely
holds
the
table
and
chairs
here
alone
with
her
little
daughter
in
a
village
of
near
two
hundred
indians
ten
miles
from
any
white
man
home
this
brave
woman
has
lived
more
than
a
year
doing
a
work
of
which
the
hours
spent
in
the
are
the
smallest
part
the
indians
come
to
her
with
every
perplexity
and
trouble
call
on
her
for
nursing
when
they
are
ill
for
food
when
they
are
destitute
if
she
would
allow
it
her
little
room
could
always
be
crowded
with
women
and
men
also
eager
to
watch
and
learn
the
cahuillas
have
good
brains
are
keen
quick
and
persevering
the
progress
that
these
children
have
made
in
the
comparatively
short
time
since
their
school
was
opened
was
far
beyond
that
ordinarily
made
by
white
children
in
the
same
length
of
time
children
who
two
years
ago
did
not
know
a
letter
read
intelligently
in
the
second
and
third
readers
spelled
promptly
and
with
remarkable
accuracy
and
wrote
clear
and
legible
hands
their
being
absolutely
free
from
blots
or
erasures
some
of
the
older
pupils
went
creditably
through
a
mental
arithmetic
examination
in
which
the
questions
were
by
no
means
easy
to
follow
they
sang
songs
in
fair
tune
and
time
and
with
great
spirit
evidently
enjoying
this
part
of
the
exercises
more
than
all
the
rest
we
had
carried
to
them
a
parcel
of
illustrated
very
kindly
contributed
by
some
of
the
leading
publishers
in
new
york
and
boston
and
the
expression
of
the
rows
of
bright
dark
eyes
as
the
teacher
held
up
book
after
book
was
long
to
be
remembered
the
strain
on
the
nervous
system
of
teachers
in
such
positions
as
this
can
hardly
be
estimated
by
ordinary
standards
the
absolute
isolation
the
ceaseless
demand
the
lack
not
only
of
the
comforts
but
of
many
of
the
necessities
of
life
all
mount
up
into
a
burden
which
it
would
seem
no
woman
could
long
endure
last
winter
there
was
a
in
the
cahuilla
valley
lasting
two
days
and
nights
a
fierce
wind
drove
the
dry
snow
in
at
every
crevice
of
the
poorly
built
adobe
house
like
sand
in
a
the
first
day
of
the
storm
the
school
had
to
be
closed
early
in
the
day
as
the
snow
fell
so
fast
on
books
and
slates
nothing
could
be
done
the
last
night
of
the
storm
the
teacher
and
her
little
girl
spent
the
entire
night
in
shovelling
snow
out
of
the
room
they
would
pile
it
in
a
blanket
open
the
door
empty
the
blanket
and
then
resume
shovelling
they
worked
hard
all
night
to
keep
pace
with
the
storm
when
the
snowing
stopped
the
was
drifted
full
and
for
many
days
after
was
wet
and
damp
it
would
seem
as
if
the
school
term
in
such
places
as
this
ought
not
to
be
over
eight
months
in
the
year
the
salaries
however
should
not
be
reduced
for
they
are
barely
living
salaries
now
every
necessary
of
life
being
procured
at
a
great
disadvantage
in
these
wild
regions
one
of
these
teachers
told
us
she
had
been
obliged
to
give
an
indian
to
ride
to
the
nearest
store
and
bring
her
one
dollar
worth
of
sugar
it
was
the
opinion
of
the
cahuilla
teacher
a
teacher
of
experience
at
the
east
before
her
marriage
that
the
indians
would
accomplish
more
in
eight
months
than
in
the
nine
the
strain
upon
them
also
is
too
the
unwonted
confinement
and
continuous
brain
work
should
this
change
be
made
the
vacation
should
be
so
arranged
as
to
be
taken
at
the
season
at
which
times
all
the
schools
are
much
broken
up
by
the
absence
of
the
elder
boys
exhibit
the
warner
ranch
indians
the
tract
known
as
warner
ranch
lies
in
the
northern
part
of
san
diego
county
about
forty
miles
from
the
cahuilla
valley
it
contains
two
grants
the
san
josé
del
valle
and
the
valle
de
san
josé
the
first
containing
between
and
acres
confirmed
to
warner
patented
january
the
second
containing
between
and
acres
confirmed
to
one
portilla
patented
january
the
whole
property
is
now
in
the
possession
of
governor
downey
of
los
angeles
there
are
said
to
be
several
conflicting
claims
yet
unsettled
the
ranch
is
now
used
as
a
sheep
and
stock
ranch
and
is
of
great
value
it
is
a
beautiful
region
well
watered
and
wooded
there
are
within
its
boundaries
five
indian
villages
of
san
luisenos
and
caliente
puerta
de
la
cruz
puerta
de
san
josé
san
josé
and
mataguay
the
last
four
are
very
small
but
aqua
caliente
has
long
been
the
most
flourishing
and
influential
village
in
the
country
it
was
formerly
set
apart
as
a
reservation
but
the
executive
order
was
cancelled
january
immediately
after
the
patenting
of
the
san
josé
del
valle
ranch
within
the
boundaries
of
which
it
was
then
claimed
that
the
village
lay
although
to
the
best
information
we
could
get
the
first
three
surveys
of
that
ranch
did
not
take
the
village
in
the
aged
captain
of
the
aqua
caliente
indians
still
preserves
a
paper
giving
a
memorandum
of
the
setting
off
of
this
reservation
of
about
acres
for
this
people
it
was
by
executive
order
he
also
treasures
several
other
equally
worthless
certificate
from
a
san
diego
judge
that
the
indians
are
entitled
to
their
lands
a
memorandum
of
a
promise
from
general
kearney
who
assured
them
that
in
consideration
of
their
friendliness
and
assistance
to
him
they
should
retain
their
homes
without
molestation
although
the
whole
state
should
fill
with
white
men
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
these
aqua
caliente
indians
find
it
difficult
to
put
any
faith
in
white
men
promises
it
will
be
seen
from
the
above
brief
statement
of
the
situation
that
they
have
an
exceedingly
strong
claim
on
the
government
for
protection
in
their
right
to
their
lands
since
the
restoration
of
their
village
and
fields
to
the
public
domain
the
patenting
of
the
ranches
and
their
sale
to
governor
downey
the
indians
have
been
in
constant
anxiety
and
terror
governor
downey
has
been
considerate
and
humane
in
his
course
toward
them
and
toward
all
the
indians
on
his
estate
and
his
superintendent
also
is
friendly
in
his
treatment
of
them
permitting
them
all
the
liberty
he
can
consistently
with
his
duty
to
the
ranch
he
finds
their
labor
invaluable
at
time
and
is
able
throughout
the
year
to
give
them
occasional
employment
but
the
indians
know
very
well
that
according
to
the
usual
course
of
things
in
san
diego
county
they
are
liable
any
day
to
be
ejected
by
process
of
law
and
it
is
astonishing
that
under
the
circumstances
they
have
so
persevered
in
their
industries
of
one
sort
and
another
they
have
a
good
number
of
fields
under
cultivation
they
also
make
saddle
mats
and
hats
out
of
fibrous
plants
the
women
make
baskets
and
lace
it
is
said
to
be
the
most
industrious
village
in
the
county
the
old
captain
dealing
severely
with
any
indian
found
idle
they
have
also
a
small
revenue
from
the
hot
springs
from
which
the
village
takes
its
name
these
bubble
up
in
a
succession
of
curious
stone
basins
in
the
heart
of
the
village
they
are
much
resorted
to
in
summer
by
rheumatic
and
other
patients
who
rent
the
indians
little
adobe
houses
and
pay
them
a
small
tax
for
the
use
of
the
waters
the
indians
themselves
at
these
times
move
into
bush
huts
in
a
valley
or
cañon
some
two
miles
above
the
village
where
their
chief
cultivated
fields
lie
they
were
very
earnest
to
know
from
us
if
we
would
advise
their
planting
more
of
this
ground
they
said
they
would
have
planted
it
all
except
that
they
were
afraid
of
being
driven
away
this
upper
valley
and
these
planting
fields
were
said
to
be
on
government
land
but
on
examination
of
the
surveyor
plats
in
the
los
angeles
land
office
we
could
find
no
field
notes
to
indicate
their
location
these
indians
have
in
use
another
valley
called
lost
valley
some
fifteen
miles
from
their
village
high
up
in
the
mountains
and
reached
only
by
one
very
steep
trail
here
they
keep
their
stock
being
no
longer
able
to
pasture
it
below
they
were
touchingly
anxious
to
have
us
write
down
the
numbers
of
cattle
horses
sheep
each
man
had
and
report
to
washington
that
the
president
might
see
how
they
were
all
trying
to
work
there
are
probably
from
one
hundred
and
to
one
hundred
and
fifty
head
of
cattle
owned
in
the
village
about
fifty
horses
and
one
hundred
sheep
there
is
here
a
government
school
taught
by
a
young
german
lady
of
excellent
education
and
much
enthusiasm
in
her
work
at
great
cost
and
risk
she
has
carried
her
piano
up
into
these
wilds
and
finds
it
an
invaluable
assistance
in
training
and
influencing
her
pupils
it
was
a
scene
not
to
be
forgotten
when
after
their
exercises
in
reading
arithmetic
in
all
of
which
they
showed
a
really
wonderful
proficiency
the
children
crowded
into
the
teacher
little
room
and
sang
their
songs
to
the
piano
accompaniment
played
by
her
with
spirit
and
feeling
my
country
is
of
thee
sweet
land
of
liberty
was
the
song
they
seemed
to
like
best
all
unaware
how
little
applicable
to
their
own
situation
were
its
strains
of
exultant
joy
and
freedom
in
this
one
tiny
room
adjoining
the
this
young
lady
lives
sleeps
prepares
her
own
food
frequently
having
a
cooking
class
of
indian
women
whom
she
is
teaching
to
make
soups
bread
and
to
do
fine
washing
it
is
impossible
to
put
too
much
appreciative
sympathy
on
these
women
teachers
in
indian
schools
in
southern
california
their
situation
and
their
work
are
unique
in
isolation
and
difficulty
the
other
indian
villages
on
warner
ranch
do
not
demand
separate
description
consisting
of
not
more
than
half
a
dozen
houses
each
and
numbering
only
from
fifteen
to
thirty
indians
each
village
however
has
its
own
captain
and
its
cultivated
fields
orchards
to
which
the
indians
are
profoundly
attached
and
from
which
it
would
be
very
hard
to
induce
them
to
move
spite
of
their
poverty
and
the
difficulty
of
making
a
living
as
they
are
now
placed
during
our
stay
at
warner
ranch
the
captain
of
the
san
josé
village
had
an
experience
which
will
illustrate
the
helplessness
of
these
indian
farmers
in
southern
california
he
had
on
a
piece
of
government
land
a
short
distance
from
his
village
a
fenced
of
some
fifty
acres
it
was
his
chief
dependence
for
his
year
support
going
away
one
day
he
left
his
aged
father
in
charge
at
home
the
old
man
wandered
away
and
during
his
absence
one
of
the
roving
of
whom
the
country
is
full
broke
down
the
fence
turned
in
his
flock
and
when
domingo
came
home
at
night
the
whole
field
was
eaten
close
to
the
ground
hearing
of
our
being
at
the
superintendent
house
domingo
came
over
to
ask
if
we
could
help
him
in
the
matter
the
quiet
way
in
which
he
told
the
story
was
more
impressive
than
any
loudness
of
complaint
would
have
been
he
said
very
simply
what
can
i
do
for
food
this
winter
kinney
rode
over
to
the
village
saw
the
field
and
after
some
trouble
found
the
herder
who
much
frightened
said
he
did
it
by
his
master
orders
this
master
an
italian
lived
some
twenty
miles
away
the
nearest
justice
of
the
peace
sixteen
miles
on
seeing
the
justice
we
found
that
nothing
could
be
done
in
the
way
of
securing
damages
from
the
until
two
white
men
residents
of
the
county
should
inspect
the
premises
and
estimate
the
damages
domingo
rode
sixteen
miles
in
the
night
in
a
fierce
storm
of
sleet
and
rain
with
letters
from
us
to
white
men
on
the
ranch
asking
them
to
do
this
he
was
back
again
at
daylight
with
a
note
from
one
of
them
saying
that
he
could
not
induce
a
man
to
go
with
him
finally
the
justice
at
our
request
hired
two
men
at
days
wages
to
go
and
inspect
the
indian
field
they
estimated
the
damages
at
about
of
the
real
amount
and
thus
we
were
obliged
to
leave
the
matter
we
afterwards
received
a
letter
from
the
italian
stating
that
he
had
settled
with
domingo
but
not
mentioning
the
sum
paid
it
was
plain
that
except
for
our
taking
hold
of
the
affair
the
indian
would
never
have
recovered
a
cent
this
is
by
no
means
an
exceptional
instance
exhibit
the
san
ysidro
indians
in
the
san
ysidro
cañon
about
eight
miles
from
warner
ranch
has
been
living
from
time
immemorial
a
band
of
san
luiseno
indians
numbering
from
fifty
to
and
called
by
the
name
of
their
cañon
we
first
saw
the
captain
of
these
indians
in
los
angeles
in
the
office
of
the
united
states
court
commissioner
lee
of
whose
kindness
and
humane
sympathy
in
dealing
with
all
indian
matters
which
come
under
his
notice
it
is
not
out
of
place
here
to
make
grateful
mention
this
captain
pablo
with
two
of
his
head
men
had
walked
a
three
journey
to
los
angeles
to
see
if
he
could
get
any
help
in
the
matter
of
lands
which
had
been
wrested
from
his
people
his
story
was
a
pitiful
one
some
six
years
ago
a
white
man
named
chatham
helm
had
come
in
at
the
head
of
their
cañon
three
miles
above
the
site
of
their
village
taken
up
a
homestead
claim
there
cutting
off
the
greater
part
of
their
water
supply
and
taking
some
of
their
cultivated
fields
and
leaving
them
restricted
room
for
their
stock
since
that
time
they
had
been
growing
poorer
and
poorer
but
had
managed
to
live
by
cultivating
lands
below
the
village
near
the
mouth
of
the
cañon
where
there
was
another
small
stream
but
now
a
new
squatter
had
appeared
below
them
and
filed
on
all
the
remaining
lands
including
the
site
of
the
village
itself
the
man
helm
above
them
had
patented
his
lands
built
a
good
house
and
was
keeping
considerable
stock
the
indians
could
have
no
water
except
what
he
permitted
to
come
down
the
cañon
three
years
ago
one
of
their
number
had
been
shot
dead
by
helm
who
was
set
free
on
the
usual
plea
of
since
then
the
indians
had
been
in
continual
terror
the
new
squatter
had
threatened
them
with
the
same
fate
if
they
came
near
his
enclosures
between
these
two
squatters
the
indian
village
was
completely
hemmed
in
and
cut
off
and
starvation
stared
them
in
the
face
in
fact
in
the
course
of
the
last
winter
one
little
girl
had
actually
died
for
want
of
food
their
countenances
corroborated
the
tale
they
were
gaunt
with
hunger
and
full
of
despair
it
would
exceed
the
limits
of
this
paper
to
give
a
full
report
of
the
interview
with
these
indians
it
will
not
soon
be
forgotten
by
any
one
taking
part
in
it
solemn
tones
in
which
the
indians
replied
to
the
questions
the
intent
and
imploring
gaze
with
which
they
studied
all
our
faces
and
listened
to
all
the
words
unintelligible
to
them
in
which
we
spoke
with
one
another
it
was
finally
decided
to
forward
to
the
interior
department
the
affidavits
of
these
indians
setting
forth
the
manner
in
which
they
had
been
robbed
of
their
lands
and
requesting
that
cloos
entry
be
held
for
cancellation
and
that
helm
patent
be
reopened
it
was
found
on
looking
the
matter
up
in
washington
that
several
years
ago
this
cañon
had
been
withdrawn
from
market
with
a
view
to
having
it
set
off
as
a
reservation
for
the
indians
living
in
it
but
the
matter
had
slipped
everybody
mind
on
visiting
the
san
ysidro
cañon
ourselves
a
few
weeks
later
we
found
that
cloos
taking
time
by
the
forelock
had
sold
out
his
homestead
claim
his
house
and
what
he
was
pleased
to
call
his
improvements
for
to
a
poor
old
widow
pamela
hagar
by
name
we
found
hagar
with
her
son
on
the
ground
preparing
to
go
into
the
bee
business
she
appeared
very
little
surprised
at
hearing
that
the
claim
she
had
bought
was
a
questionable
one
remarking
well
i
mistrusted
something
was
wrong
cloos
seemed
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
his
money
this
woman
appeared
nearly
as
helpless
as
the
indians
themselves
the
deed
she
had
taken
from
cloos
was
not
acknowledged
she
had
not
got
it
recorded
her
name
was
misspelled
in
it
and
the
enumeration
of
the
sections
in
it
did
not
agree
with
the
list
in
the
land
office
certificate
she
begged
us
to
ask
the
government
to
refund
to
her
the
sum
she
had
paid
to
cloos
and
signed
by
her
mark
a
paper
saying
she
would
accept
it
it
is
a
small
sum
and
as
the
poor
old
woman
made
the
transaction
in
good
faith
knowing
nothing
about
the
indians
presence
on
the
place
it
would
seem
not
unreasonable
that
she
should
be
paid
the
next
morning
cloos
himself
appeared
on
the
scene
very
angry
and
resentful
he
said
he
had
a
perfect
right
to
file
on
that
land
that
indians
were
not
citizens
and
had
no
right
to
public
lands
and
that
the
stockmen
of
san
diego
county
were
not
going
to
stand
the
indians
killing
their
stock
much
longer
that
the
government
ought
to
put
the
indians
all
together
somewhere
and
take
care
of
them
and
that
there
be
a
big
fight
with
indians
in
san
diego
county
before
long
we
might
rest
assured
of
that
and
much
more
of
the
same
sort
which
would
not
be
worth
repeating
except
that
it
is
a
good
illustration
of
the
animus
of
the
greater
portion
of
southern
california
ranchmen
towards
indians
a
few
days
after
this
we
were
gladdened
by
the
news
from
washington
that
cloos
filing
was
held
for
cancellation
and
that
the
had
ordered
proceedings
to
be
begun
in
san
francisco
for
the
vacating
of
chatham
helm
patent
a
few
instances
of
such
promptitude
as
this
would
change
the
whole
status
of
the
south
california
indians
giving
courage
to
them
and
what
is
still
more
important
making
it
clear
to
the
perception
of
white
men
that
the
indians
rights
are
no
longer
to
be
disregarded
as
they
have
been
exhibit
the
los
coyotes
five
miles
up
from
the
head
of
the
san
ysidro
cañon
to
be
reached
only
by
a
steep
and
narrow
trail
lies
a
small
valley
on
the
desert
side
of
the
mountains
it
is
little
more
than
a
pocket
on
a
ledge
from
its
rim
one
looks
down
directly
into
the
desert
few
white
men
have
ever
penetrated
to
it
and
the
indians
occupying
it
have
been
hitherto
safe
by
reason
of
the
poverty
and
inaccessibility
of
their
home
no
agent
has
ever
visited
them
they
have
supported
themselves
by
keeping
stock
and
cultivating
their
few
acres
of
land
there
are
not
more
than
eighty
acres
all
told
in
the
valley
about
three
weeks
before
our
arrival
at
warner
ranch
a
man
named
jim
fane
a
comrade
of
helm
who
had
usurped
the
san
ysidro
cañon
having
no
doubt
learned
through
helm
of
the
existence
of
the
los
coyotes
valley
appeared
in
the
village
and
offered
the
indians
for
their
place
they
refused
to
sell
upon
which
he
told
them
that
he
had
filed
on
the
land
should
stay
in
any
event
and
proceeded
to
cut
down
trees
and
build
a
corral
it
seems
a
marvellous
forbearance
on
the
part
of
a
community
numbering
men
and
women
not
to
take
any
forcible
measures
to
repel
such
an
intruder
as
this
but
the
south
california
indians
have
learned
by
long
experience
that
in
any
contest
with
white
men
they
are
sure
to
be
found
in
the
wrong
not
an
indian
laid
violent
hands
on
fane
he
seems
to
have
gone
about
as
safely
in
the
heart
of
this
indian
village
which
he
was
avowedly
making
ready
to
steal
as
if
he
had
been
in
an
empty
wilderness
kinney
found
him
there
hard
at
work
his
belt
full
of
cartridges
and
pistols
he
was
a
rough
fellow
at
first
disposed
to
be
defiant
and
blustering
but
on
being
informed
of
the
department
action
in
the
case
of
cloos
filing
he
took
a
milder
tone
and
signed
a
paper
saying
that
he
would
take
for
his
improvements
later
in
the
day
after
consulting
with
his
friend
helm
he
withdrew
the
paper
and
announced
his
determination
to
stay
in
the
valley
on
inquiry
at
the
land
office
at
los
angeles
we
found
that
his
filing
had
been
returned
to
him
for
correction
of
errors
we
were
therefore
in
time
to
secure
the
stopping
of
all
further
proceedings
on
his
part
through
the
land
office
nothing
however
but
authorized
and
authoritative
action
on
the
part
of
the
agent
representing
the
interior
department
will
stop
his
proceedings
on
the
ground
just
before
leaving
california
we
received
an
urgent
letter
from
the
los
coyotes
captain
saying
that
fane
was
still
cutting
down
their
trees
and
building
corrals
the
indians
of
this
band
are
robust
active
and
finely
made
more
nearly
in
the
native
health
and
strength
of
the
race
than
any
other
band
in
the
country
the
large
proportion
of
children
also
bore
testimony
to
their
healthful
condition
there
being
children
to
women
and
men
the
captain
had
the
lists
of
his
people
kept
by
three
lines
of
notches
on
a
stick
a
new
notch
being
made
for
each
birth
and
crossed
out
for
each
death
they
could
count
only
up
to
five
everything
beyond
that
was
many
their
houses
were
good
built
of
hewn
pine
timber
with
thatched
roofs
made
from
some
tough
fibrous
plant
probably
the
yucca
each
house
had
a
thatched
bower
in
front
of
it
and
stood
in
a
fenced
enclosure
these
indians
raise
beans
pumpkins
wheat
barley
and
corn
they
have
head
of
cattle
and
more
horses
they
say
they
have
lived
in
this
valley
always
and
never
desire
to
leave
it
the
only
things
they
asked
for
were
a
harness
chain
coulter
and
five
ploughs
they
have
now
one
plough
this
village
is
one
of
the
best
illustrations
of
our
remarks
on
the
need
of
itinerary
labor
among
the
mission
indians
here
is
a
village
of
souls
living
in
a
mountain
fastness
which
they
so
love
they
would
rather
die
than
leave
it
but
where
the
ordinary
agencies
and
influences
of
civilization
will
never
reach
no
matter
how
thickly
settled
the
regions
below
may
come
a
fervent
religious
and
practical
teacher
spending
a
few
weeks
each
year
among
these
indians
might
sow
seed
that
would
never
cease
growing
during
the
intervals
of
his
absence
exhibit

the
santa

far
not
only
left
undisturbed
the
indian
village
within
the
boundaries
of
his
estate
but
has
endeavored
to
protect
the
indians
by
allowing
to
the
ranch
lessee
a
rebate
of
yearly
on
the
rent
on
account
of
the
indians
occupancy
there
is
in
the
original
grant
of
this
ranch
the
following
clause
the
grantees
will
leave
free
and
undisturbed
the
agricultural
lands
which
the
indians
of
san
diego
are
actually
occupying
we
found
on
arriving
at
the
santa
ysabel
village
that
an
intelligent
young
indian
living
there
had
recently
been
elected
as
general
over
the
dieguino
indians
in
the
neighborhood
he
showed
to
us
his
papers
and
begged
us
to
wait
till
he
could
have
all
his
captains
gathered
to
meet
us
eight
villages
he
reported
as
being
under
his
control
ysabel
mesa
grande
mesa
chilquita
san
josé
mataguay
la
puerta
laguna
and
anaha
he
was
full
of
interest
and
inquiry
and
enthusiasm
about
his
people
i
want

american
way
he
said
in
his
broken
english

all
these
people
what
we
want
some
man
right
here
to
go
to
while
you
here
white
man
very
good
when
you
go
away
trouble
same
as
before
there
are
one
hundred
and
indians
in
this
village
they
are
very
poor
many
of
their
houses
are
of
tule
or
brush
their
clothes
were
scanty
and
ragged
some
of
the
older
men
wearing
but
a
single
garment
that
they
had
not
been
idle
their
big
proved
between
three
and
four
hundred
acres
fenced
and
the
wheat
well
up
how
do
you
divide
the
crops
we
asked
every
man
knows
his
own
piece
was
the
reply
they
sell
all
of
this
wheat
that
they
can
spare
to
a
storekeeper
some
three
miles
away
having
no
wagon
they
draw
the
wheat
there
on
a
sort
of
sledge
or
wood
triangle
about
four
feet
long
with
slats
across
it
a
rope
is
tied
to
the
apex
of
this
then
fastened
to
the
horn
of
a
saddle
on
a
horse
ridden
by
a
man
who
steers
the
sledge
as
best
he
may
the
indians
brought
this
sledge
to
show
us
to
prove
how
sorely
they
needed
wagons
they
also
made
the
women
bring
out
all
the
children
and
arrange
them
in
rows
to
show
that
they
had
enough
for
a
school
repeating
over
and
over
that
they
had
many
more
but
they
were
all
out
digging
wild
roots
and
vegetables
if
there
was
not
great
many
them
my
people
die
hungry
said
the
general
them
most
what
we
got
eat
it
is
a
sore
grievance
to
these
santa
ysabel
indians
that
the
aqua
caliente
indians
only
twenty
miles
away
have
received
from
the
government
a
school
ploughs
wagons
while
nothing
whatever
has
been
done
for
them
them
aqua
caliente
indians
got
everything
said
the
general
got
hot
springs
too
make
money
on
them
hot
springs
my
people
got
no
chance
make
money
on
the
second
day
of
our
stay
in
this
region
we
saw
four
of
the
young
general
captains
those
of
puerta
san
felipe
san
josé
anaha
and
laguna
in
puerta
san
felipe
are
people
this
village
is
on
a
confirmed
grant
the
valle
de
san
felipe
confirmed
to
felipe
castillo
the
ranch
is
now
leased
to
a
frenchman
who
is
taking
away
the
water
from
the
indian
village
and
tells
the
captain
that
the
whole
village
belongs
to
him
and
that
if
anybody
so
much
as
hunts
a
rabbit
on
the
place
he
will
put
him
in
prison
these
people
are
in
great
destitution
and
trouble
being
deprived
of
most
of
their
previous
means
of
support
the
anaha
captain
reported
people
in
his
village
white
men
had
come
in
and
fenced
up
land
on
both
sides
of
him
when
he
plants
his
wheat
and
grain
the
white
men
run
their
hogs
into
the
fields
and
when
the
white
men
find
anything
dead
they
come
to
him
to
make
him
tell
everything
about
it
and
he
has
not
got
anything
to
tell
the
san
josé
captain
had
a
similar
story
the
laguna
captain
was
a
tall
swarthy
indian
so
unlike
all
the
rest
that
we
wondered
what
there
could
have
been
in
his
life
to
produce
such
a
difference
he
said
nobody
troubled
him
he
had
good
land
plenty
of
water
raised
grain
and
vegetables
everything
he
wanted
except
watermelons
his
village
contained
eleven
persons
was
to
be
reached
only
by
a
steep
trail
the
last
four
miles
we
expressed
our
pleasure
at
finding
one
indian
captain
and
village
that
were
in
no
trouble
and
wanted
for
nothing
he
smiled
mysteriously
as
we
afterward
recalled
and
reiterated
that
nobody
troubled
him
the
mystery
was
explained
later
when
we
discovered
accidentally
in
san
diego
that
this
laguna
village
had
not
escaped
as
we
supposed
the
inroads
of
white
men
and
that
the
only
reason
that
the
laguna
indians
were
not
in
trouble
was
that
they
had
peaceably
surrendered
half
their
lands
to
a
white
man
who
was
living
amicably
among
them
under
a
sort
of
contract
or
lease
exhibit
mesa
grande
mesa
grande
lies
high
up
above
the
santa
ysabel
village
and
fifteen
miles
west
of
it
the
tract
adjoins
the
santa
ysabel
ranch
and
is
as
its
name
indicates
a
large
there
was
set
off
here
in
a
large
reservation
intended
to
include
the
mesa
grande
indian
village
and
also
a
smaller
one
of
mesa
chilquita
but
as
usual
the
villages
were
outside
of
the
lines
and
the
lands
reserved
were
chiefly
worthless
one
of
the
settlers
in
the
neighborhood
told
us
he
would
not
take
the
whole
reservation
as
a
gift
and
pay
the
taxes
on
it
the
situation
of
the
indians
here
is
exceedingly
unfortunate
and
growing
more
and
more
so
daily
the
good
mesa
grande
lands
which
they
once
owned
and
occupied
and
which
should
have
been
secured
to
them
have
been
fast
taken
up
by
whites
the
indians
driven
off
and
as
the
young
general
said
all
bunched
up
till
they
have
got
any
room
both
the
mesa
chilquita
and
mesa
grande
plateaus
are
now
well
under
cultivation
by
whites
who
have
good
houses
and
large
tracts
fenced
in
they
have
built
a
good
which
we
chanced
to
pass
at
the
hour
of
recess
and
noting
indian
faces
among
the
children
stopped
to
inquire
about
them
there
were
out
of
scholars
fifteen
indians
or
some
of
them
the
children
of
indians
who
had
taken
up
homesteads
we
asked
the
teacher
what
was
the
relative
brightness
of
the
indian
and
white
children
supposing
that
we
shared
the
usual
prejudice
against
indians
the
teacher
answered
in
a
judiciously
deprecating
tone
well
really
there
is
so
much
difference
between
them
as
you
would
suppose
in
favor
of
which
race
we
asked
thus
suddenly
enlightened
as
to
our
animus
in
the
matter
the
teacher
changed
his
tone
and
said
he
found
the
indian
children
full
as
bright
as
the
whites
in
fact
the
brightest
scholar
he
had
was
a
girl
on
the
census
list
taken
of
indians
in
mesa
grande
and
mesa
chilquita
are
reported
as
having
the
first
one
hundred
and
three
indians
the
second
there
are
probably
not
so
many
now
the
mesa
chilquita
tract
being
almost
wholly
in
possession
of
the
whites
the
mesa
grande
village
has
a
beautiful
site
on
a
small
stream
in
a
sort
of
hill
basin
surrounded
by
higher
hills
the
houses
are
chiefly
adobe
and
there
is
on
one
of
the
slopes
a
neat
little
adobe
chapel
with
a
shingled
roof
nearly
done
of
which
the
indians
were
very
proud
there
were
many
fields
of
grain
and
a
few
fruit
orchards
the
women
gathered
around
our
carriage
in
eager
groups
insisting
on
shaking
hands
and
holding
up
their
little
children
to
shake
hands
also
they
have
but
once
seen
an
agent
of
the
government
and
any
evidence
of
real
interest
in
them
and
their
welfare
touches
them
deeply
the
condition
of
the
indians
in
this
district
is
too
full
of
complications
and
troubles
to
be
written
out
here
in
detail
a
verbatim
copy
of
a
few
of
our
notes
taken
on
the
spot
will
give
a
good
picture
of
the
situation
chrysanto
an
indian
put
off
his
farm
two
months
ago
by
white
man
named
jim
angel
with
certificate
of
homestead
from
los
angeles
land
office
antonio
douro
another
put
off
in
same
way
from
his
farm
near
he
had
built
good
wooden
house
the
white
man
took
that
and
half
his
land
he
was
ploughing
when
the
white
man
came
and
said
get
out
i
have
bought
this
land
they
have
been
to
the
agent
they
have
been
ten
times
till
they
are
tired
to
go
another
american
named
hardy
ran
an
indian
off
his
farm
built
a
house
on
it
then
he
sold
it
to
johnson
and
johnson
took
a
little
more
land
and
johnson
sold
it
to
stone
and
he
took
still
more
they
used
to
be
well
fixed
had
plenty
of
stock
and
hundreds
of
horses
now
they
are
all
penned
up
and
have
had
to
pay
such
fines
they
have
got
poor
whites
take
their
horses
and
cattle
and
corral
them
and
make
them
pay
cents
cents
to
get
them
out
is
that
american
law
they
asked
and
if
it
is
law
for
horses
is
it
not
same
for
white
men
horses
but
one
indian
shut
up
some
of
the
white
men
horses
that
came
on
his
land
and
the
constable
came
and
took
them
all
away
and
made
the
indian
pay
money
the
americans
so
thick
now
they
want
all
the
indians
away
so
to
make
them
go
they
keep
accusing
them
of
stealing
this
is
a
small
tithe
of
what
we
were
told
it
was
pitiful
to
see
the
hope
die
out
of
the
indians
faces
as
they
laid
grievance
after
grievance
before
us
and
we
were
obliged
to
tell
them
we
could
do
nothing
except
to
tell
the
government
on
our
way
back
to
santa
ysabel
we
were
waylaid
by
several
indians
some
of
them
very
aged
each
with
the
same
story
of
having
been
driven
off
or
being
in
imminent
danger
of
being
driven
off
his
lands
on
the
following
day
we
had
a
long
interview
with
one
of
the
white
settlers
of
mesa
grande
and
learned
some
particulars
as
to
a
combination
into
which
the
mesa
grande
whites
had
entered
to
protect
themselves
against
cattle
and
horse
thieves
the
young
indian
general
was
present
at
this
interview
his
boots
were
toeless
he
wore
an
old
gingham
shirt
and
ragged
waistcoat
but
his
bearing
was
full
of
dignity
according
to
the
white
man
story
this
combination
was
not
a
vigilance
committee
at
all
it
was
called
the
protective
league
of
mesa
grande
and
had
no
special
reference
to
indians
in
any
way
according
to
the
indian
general
story
it
was
a
vigilance
committee
and
all
the
indians
knew
very
well
that
their
lives
were
in
danger
from
it
the
white
man
protested
against
this
and
reiterated
his
former
statements
to
our
inquiry
why
if
the
league
were
for
the
mutual
protection
of
all
in
the
region
the
captains
of
the
indian
villages
were
not
invited
to
join
it
he
replied
that
he
himself
would
have
been
in
favor
of
that
but
that
to
the
average
white
settler
in
the
region
such
a
suggestion
would
be
like
a
red
rag
to
a
bull
that
he
himself
however
was
a
warm
friend
to
the
indians
how
long
you
been
friend
to
indians
asked
the
with
quiet
sarcasm
we
afterwards
learned
by
inquiry
of
one
of
the
most
influential
citizens
of
a
neighboring
town
that
this
protective
league
was
in
fact
nothing
more
or
less
than
a
vigilance
committee
and
that
it
meant
short
shrift
to
indians
but
being
betrayed
by
one
of
its
members
it
had
come
to
an
untimely
end
to
the
great
relief
of
all
people
in
the
vicinity
he
also
added
that
the
greater
part
of
the
cattle
and
horse
stealing
in
the
region
was
done
by
mexicans
and
whites
not
by
indians
whether
it
is
possible
for
the
government
to
put
these
mesa
grande
indians
into
a
position
to
protect
themselves
and
have
anything
like
a
fair
chance
to
make
their
living
in
their
present
situation
is
a
question
but
that
it
ought
to
be
done
if
possible
is
beyond
question
it
is
grievous
to
think
that
this
fine
tract
of
land
so
long
owned
and
occupied
by
these
indians
and
in
good
faith
intended
by
the
government
to
be
set
aside
for
their
use
has
thus
passed
into
other
hands
even
if
the
reservation
tract
some
three
hundred
acres
has
been
by
fraudulent
representations
restored
to
the
public
domain
and
now
occupied
by
a
man
named
clelland
who
has
taken
steps
to
patent
it
the
tract
by
proper
investigation
and
action
could
probably
be
reclaimed
for
the
use

capitan

the
name
of
the
cañon

which
the
san

it

paper
no
appended
hereto
these
indians
have
continued
ever
since
to
live
there
although
latterly
they
have
been
so
much
pressed
upon
by
white
settlers
that
their
numbers
have
been
reduced
a
large
reservation
showing
on
the
record
nineteen
full

nearly
all
on

bare
sides
of
the
mountain
walls
of
the
cañon
as
usual
the
village
site
was
not
taken
in
by
the
lines
therefore
white
settlers
have
come
in
and
the
indians
been
driven
away
we
were
informed
that
a
petition
was
in
circulation
for
the
restoration
to
the
public
domain
of
a
part
of
this
reservation
we
could
not
succeed
in
finding
a
copy
of
this
petition
but
it
goes
without
saying
that
any
such
petition
means
the
taking
away
from
the
indians

few
remaining
bits
of
good
land
in
their
possession
there
are

only

and
more
encroached

by

settlers
until
now
they
can

and
have
little
cultivable
land
left
there
is
a
small
reservation
of
one
section
set
off
for
them
but
the
lines
were
never
pointed
out
to
them
and
they
said
to
us
they
did
not
know
whether
it
were
true
that
they
had
a
reservation
or
not
they
had
heard
also
that
there
was
an
agent
for
the
indians
but
they
did
not
know
whether
that
were
true
or
not
as
nearly
as
we
could
determine
this
village
is
within
the
reservation
lines
and
if
it
is
some
of
the
fields
which
have
been
recently
taken
away
from
the
indians
by
the
whites
must
be
also
they
had
the
usual
bundle
of
tattered
papers
to
show
some
of
which
were
so
old
they
were
hardly
legible
one
of
them
was
a
certificate
from
a
justice
of
the
peace
in
san
diego
setting
forth
that
this
justice
by
virtue
of
power
in
him
vested
by
the
california
state
law
permit
hereby
all
these
indians
to
occupy
peaceably
and
without
disturbance
all
the
certain
land
and
premises
heretofore
occupied

held
by
these
indians
aforesaid
including
all
their
right
and
title
to
all
other
necessary
privileges
thereto
belonging
mainly
the
water
necessary
for
the
irrigation
of
their
lands
these
indians
are
much
dispirited
and
demoralized
and
wretchedly
poor
probably
the
best
thing
for
them
would
be
in
case
the
capitan
grande
cañon
is
cleared
of
whites
and
assured
to
the
indians
to
remove
there
and
join
the
capitan
grande
band
exhibit
the
conejos
the
conejos
are
of
the
dieguino
tribe
their
village
is
said
to
be
partly
on
the
capitan
grande
reservation
one
man
familiar
with
the
region
told
us
that
the
reservation
line
ran
through
the
centre
of
the
conejos
village
the
village
is
reached
only
by
a
horseback
trail
and
we
did
not
visit
it
the
captain
came
to
san
diego
to
see
us
and
we
also
learned
many
particulars
of
the
village
from
an
intelligent
ranchwoman
who
has
spent
eleven
summers
in
its
vicinity
there
are
men
women
and
children
in
the
band
they
have
good
fields
of
wheat
and
raise
corn
squashes
and
beans
yet
there
is
not
a
plough
in
the
village
the
captain
is
very
strenuous
in
his
efforts
to
make
all
his
indians
work
when
strange
indians
come
to
the
village
to
visit
they
also
are
set
to
work
no
one
is
allowed
to
remain
longer
than
three
days
without
lending
a
hand
at
the
village
labor
they
are
a
strong
and
robust
band
they
say
they
have
always
lived
in
their
present
place
the
captain
asked
for
ploughs
harnesses
and
all
things
to
work
with
also
for
some
clothes
for
his
very
old
men
and
women
he
also
begged
to
be
told
all
the
things
he
ought
to
know
said
no
agent
had
ever
visited
them
and
no
one
ever
told
them
anything
in
many
of
their
perplexities
they
are
in
the
habit
of
consulting
gregory
and
she
often
mounts
her
horse
and
rides
nine
miles
to
be
present
at
one
of
their
councils
not
long
ago
one
of
their
number
a
very
young
indian
having
stabbed
a
white
man
living
near
julian
was
arrested
put
in
jail
and
in
imminent
danger
of
being
lynched
by
the
julian
mob
they
were
finally
persuaded
however
to
give
him
up
to
his
tribe
to
be
tried
and
punished
by
them
gregory
was
sent
for
to
be
present
at
the
trial
the
facts
in
the
case
were
that
the
irishman
had
attempted
to
take
the
young
indian
wife
by
force
the
husband
interfering
the
irishman
who
was
drunk
fired
at
him
upon
which
the
indian
drew
his
knife
and
stabbed
the
irishman
gregory
found
the
young
indian
tied
up
in
the
snow
a
circle
of
indians
sitting
around
him
recounting
the
facts
the
captain
said
to
gregory
now
what
do
you
think
i
ought
to
do
would
you
think
he
deserved
punishment
if
it
were
an
indian
he
had
stabbed
under
the
same
circumstances
asked
gregory
certainly
not
was
the
reply
we
should
say
he
did
just
right
i
think
so
too
said
gregory
the
irishman
deserved
to
be
killed
but
the
captain
said
the
white
people
would
be
angry
with
him
if
no
punishment
were
inflicted
on
the
young
man
so
they
whipped
him
and
banished
him
from
the
rancheria
for
one
year
gregory
said
that
during
the
eleven
years
that
they
had
kept
their
cattle
ranch
in
the
neighborhood
of
this
village
but
one
cow
had
ever
been
stolen
by
the
indians
and
in
that
instance
the
indians
themselves
assisted
in
tracking
the
thief
and
punished
him
severely

the

so
far
as
we
could
learn
its
location
contains
very
little
good
land
the
greater
part

here
is
a
village
of
nearly
two
hundred
indians
their
fields
are
fenced
well
irrigated
and
under
good
cultivation
in
grains
and
vegetables
they
have
horses
and
sheep
as
we
drove
into
the
village
an
indian
boy
was
on
hand
with
his
hoe
to
instantly
repair
the
break
in
the
embankment
of
the
ditches
across
which
we
were
obliged
to
drive
these
indians
have
been
reported
to
us
as
being
antagonistic
and
troublesome
having
refused
to
have
a
government
school
established
there
upon
inquiry
of
them
we
found
that
the
latter
fact
was
true
they
said
they
wanted
a
title
to
their
lands
and
till
they
had
that
they
did
not
wish
to
accept
anything
from
the
government
that
the
agent
had
promised
it
to
them
again
and
again
but
that
they
had
now
lost
faith
in
ever
getting
it
the
captain
said
the
commissioners
come
one
day
and
tell
us
we
own
the
lands
and
fields
the
next
day
comes
somebody
and
measures
and
then
we
are
out
of
our
houses
and
fields
and
have
to
live
like
dogs
on
the
outskirts
of
this
village
is
living
a
andrew
scott
who
claims
some
of
the
indians
fields
and
cuts
off
part
of
their
water
supply
he
is
reported
as
selling
whiskey
to
them
and
in
this
and
other
ways
doing
them
great
harm
it
is
not
improbable
that
he
would
be
found
to
be
within

is
on

ranch
the
purchase
of

for

occupancy
we
have
recommended
to
the
government
this
ranch
is
now
rented
and
the
indians
are
much
interfered
with
by
the
lessee
who
is
naturally
reluctant
to
lose
the
profit
off
a
single
acre
of

there
is
in

original
grant
of

small
quantity

region
we
were
unable
to
visit
the
indian
village
is
said
to
be
outside
the
reservation
lines
there
is
a
claim
against
this
tract
and
the
la
jolla
captain
told
us
that
the
parties
representing
it
had
said
to
him
that
they
were
coming
in
with
sheep
next
year
and
would
drive
all
the
indians
out
upon
inquiry
at
the
office
in

in

to
the

tract
we
learned
that
there
is
a
record
on

in

of

purporting
to
show
that
there
was
a

bought
the
interest
of
the
grantees
and
a
contract
was
afterwards
made
between
judge
sawyer
of
san
francisco
and
himself
to
secure
its
approval
by
a
special
act
of
congress
about
three
years
ago
an
act
was
passed
approving
the
grant
for
about
acres
reserving
therefrom
all
lands
then
occupied
if
this
included
indians
there
would
not
be
much
of
la
jolla
left
it
is
evident
that
this
is
a
claim
which
should
be
closely
investigated
the
probabilities
are
that
it
would
not
bear
such
investigation
in
pala
some
of
the
indians
had
been
ejected
from
their
homes
under
circumstances
of
great
cruelty
and
injustice
affidavits
setting
forth
the
facts
in
their
case
were
forwarded
by
us
to
washington
see
paper
no
appended
hereto
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
indians
can
be
reinstated
in
their
homes
if
the
pauma
ranch
be
purchased
for
indian
occupancy
as
we
recommend
it
will
with
the
present
reservation
tracts
of
the
rincon
pala
and
la
jolla
make
a
sizable
block
of
land
where
the
indians
will
be
comparatively
free
from
white
intrusion
and
where
they
will
have
a
good
chance
to
support
themselves

until

about

a
portion
of
said
land
for
three
months
at
a
rental
of
per

after
this
said
golsh
claimed
the

of

of

ordered

on

occasion
aimed
a

at

he
then
proceeded
to
file
on
the
land
and
obtained
a
patent
for
the
land
while
these
indians
were
still
residing
upon
it
the
said
indians
had
upon
the
said

four
houses
one
of
which
is
adobe
various
enclosed
fields
and
a
long
ditch
for
bringing
irrigation
water
to
the
said
lands
in
spite
of
the
threats
of
arthur
golsh
and
others
we
continued
to
occupy
the
lands
until
december
when
we
were
informed
by
agent
lawson
that
if
we
did
not
leave
voluntarily
we
would
be
put
off
by

therefore
pray
that

of
the
justice
of

peace
in
pala
exhibit
the
pachanga
indians
this
little
band
of
indians
is
worthy
of
a
special
mention
they
are
san
luisenos
and
formerly
lived
in
the
temecula
valley
where
they
had
good
adobe
houses
and
a
large
tract
of
land
under
cultivation
the
ruins
of
these
houses
are
still
standing
there
also
their
walled
graveyard
full
of
graves
there
had
been
a
settlement
of
indians
in
this
temecula
valley
from
time
immemorial
and
at
the
time
of
the
secularization
of
the
missions
many
of
the
neophytes
of
san
luis
rey
returned
thither
to
their
old
home
at
the
time
of
the
outbreak
of
the
aqua
caliente
indians
in
these
temecula
indians
refused
to
join
in
it
and
moved
their
families
and
stock
to
los
angeles
for
protection
pablo
their
chief
at
that
time
was
a
man
of
some
education
could
read
and
write
and
possessed
large
herds
of
cattle
and
horses
this
temecula
valley
was
a
part
of
the
tract
given
to
the
san
luisenos
and
dieguinos
by
the
treaty
of
january
referred
to
in
the
body
of
this
report
see
page
in
a
decree
of
ejectment
against
these
indians
was
obtained
in
the
san
francisco
courts
without
the
indians
knowledge
the
san
diego
union
of
september
says
on
the
subject
for
forty
years
these
indians
have
been
recognized
as
the
most
thrifty
and
industrious
indians
in
all
california
for
more
than
twenty
years
past
these
indians
have
been
yearly
told
by
the
united
states
commissioners
and
agents
both
special
and
general
as
well
as
by
their
legal
counsel
that
they
could
remain
on
these
lands
now
without
any
previous
knowledge
by
them
of
any
proceedings
in
court
they
are
ordered
to
leave
their
lands
and
homes
the
order
of
ejectment
has
been
served
on
them
by
the
sheriff
of
san
diego
county
he
is
not
only
commanded
to
remove
these
indians
but
to
take
of
their
property
whatever
may
be
required
to
pay
the
costs
incurred
in
the
suit
comment
on
the
extracts
would
be
superfluous
there
is
not
often
so
much
of
history
condensed
in
the
same
number
of
newspaper
paragraphs
a
portion
of
these
temecula
indians
wishing
to
remain
as
near
their
old
homes
and
the
graves
of
their
dead
as
possible
went
over
in
the
pachanga
cañon
only
three
miles
distant
it
was
a
barren
dry
spot
but
the
indians
sunk
a
well
built
new
houses
and
went
to
work
again
in
the
spring
of
when
we
first
visited
the
place
there
was
a
considerable
amount
of
land
in
wheat
and
barley
and
a
little
fencing
had
been
done
in
july
the
tract
was
set
off
by
executive
order
as
a
reservation
for
these
indians
in
the
following
may
we
visited
the
valley
again
our
first
thought
on
entering
it
was
would
that
all
persons
who
still
hold
to
the
belief
that
indians
will
not
work
could
see
this
valley
it
would
be
hardly
an
extreme
statement
to
say
that
the
valley
was
one
continuous
field
of
grain
at
least
four
times
the
amount
of
the
previous
year
had
been
planted
corrals
had
been
built
fruit
orchards
started
one
man
had
even
so
far
followed
white
men
example
as
to
fence
in
his
orchard
a
piece
of
the
road
which
passed
his
place
the
whole
expression
of
the
place
had
changed
so
great
a
stimulus
had
there
been
to
the
indians
in
even
the
slight
additional
sense
of
security
given
by
the
executive
order
setting
off
their
valley
as
a
reservation
and
strangely
enough
as
if
nature
herself
had
conspired
at
once
to
help
and
to
avenge
these
indians
in
the
temecula
valley
from
which
they
had
been
driven
out
the
white
men
grain
crops
were
thin
poor
hardly
worth
cutting
while
the
indians
fields
were
waving
high
and
the
best
wheat
and
barley
we
had
seen
in
the
county
it
is
fortunate
that
this
little
nook
of
cultivable
land
was
set
aside
as
a
reservation
had
it
not
been
it
would
have
been
filed
on
before
now
by
the
whites
in
the
region
who
already
look
with
envy
and
chagrin
on
the
crops
the
indian
exiles
have
wrested
from
land
nobody
thought
worth
taking
up
a
government
school
has
been
opened
here
within
the
past
year
and
the
scholars
have
made
good
progress
we
found
however
much
unpleasant
feeling
among
the
indians
in
regard
to
the
teacher
of
this
school
owing
to
his
having
a
few
years
before
driven
off
four
indian
families
from
their
lands
at
pala
and
patented
the
lands
to
himself
there
were
also
other
rumors
seriously
affecting
his
moral
character
which
led
us
to
make
the
suggestion
in
regard
to
the
employment
of
female
teachers
in
these
indian
schools
see
report
recommendation
as
one
of
the
indians
forcibly
said
to
set
such
men
as
this
over
schools
was
like
setting
the
wolf
to
take
care
of
the
lambs
these
pachanga
indians
had
before
the
setting
aside
of
their
tract
as
a
reservation
taken
steps
towards
the
securing
of
their
cañon
and
the
dividing
it
among
themselves
under
the
provisions
of
the
indian
homestead
act
they
were
counselled
to
this
and
assisted
in
it
by
richard
eagan
of
san
juan
capistrano
well
known
as
a
good
friend
of
the
indians
they
have
expressed
themselves
as
deeply
regretting
that
they
were
persuaded
to
abandon
this
plan
and
have
the
tract
set
off
as
a
reservation
they
were
told
that
they
could
in
this
way
get
their
individual
titles
just
as
securely
and
without
cost
finding
that
they
have
no
individual
titles
and
can
not
get
them
they
are
greatly
disappointed
it
would
seem
wise
to
allow
them
as
soon
as
possible
to
carry
out
their
original
intention
they
are
quite
ready
and
fit
for
it
exhibit
the
desert
indians
the
indians
known
as
the
desert
indians
are
chiefly
of
the
cahuilla
tribe
and
are
all
under
the
control
of
an
aged
chief
named
cabezon
who
is
said
to
have
more
power
and
influence
than
any
indian
now
living
in
california
these
indians
settlements
are
literally
in
the
desert
some
of
them
being
in
that
depressed
basin
many
feet
below
which
all
travellers
over
the
southern
pacific
railroad
will
recollect
there
is
in
this
desert
one
reservation
called
aqua
caliente
of
about
acres
from
the
best
information
that
we
can
get
this
is
all
barren
desert
land
with
only
one
spring
in
it
these
desert
indians
are
wretchedly
poor
and
need
help
perhaps
more
than
any
others
in
southern
california
we
were
unable
to
visit
these
indians
personally
but
were
so
fortunate
as
to
induce
capt
stanley
a
former
indian
agent
for
the
mission
indians
and
a
warm
friend
of
theirs
to
go
out
in
our
stead
and
report
to
us
on
their
condition
his
report
is
herewith
given
madam
compliance
with
your
request
i
proceeded
to
the
cabezon
valley
and
have
endeavored
as
far
as
was
possible
with
the
limited
time
at
my
command
to
ascertain
the
present
condition
and
actual
necessities
of
these
indians
that
still
inhabit
that
portion
of
the
colorado
basin
known
as
the
cabezon
valley
that
being
also
the
name
of
the
head
chief
who
from
the
best
information
that
can
be
obtained
is
not
less
than
ninety
and
probably
one
hundred
years
old
and
who
still
has
great
influence
with
all
the
indians
in
that
region
i
found
it
impracticable
to
visit
all
the
rancherias
and
accordingly
sent
out
runners
and
called
a
council
of
all
the
indians
of
all
the
villages
to
be
held
at
a
point
on
the
railroad
known
as
walter
station
that
being
the
most
central
point
the
next
day
there
were
present
in
council
about
one
hundred
indians
including
the
captains
of
all
the
rancherias
and
the
old
chief
cabezon
having
been
special
agent
under
the
old
superintendent
system
and
well
acquainted
with
the
indians
i
was
received
by
them
with
the
greatest
cordiality
i
read
and
interpreted
your
letter
to
cabezon
and
also
explained
that
you
were
not
able
to
visit
them
in
person
on
account
of
ill
health
the
indians
through
their
spokesman
or
interpreter
then
stated
their
cause
of
complaint
first
that
lawson
had
never
visited
their
villages
nor
taken
any
interest
in
their
welfare
that
he
had
allowed
his
interpreter
juan
morengo
to
take
the
advantage
of
them
that
juan
morengo
had
made
a
contract
for
them
with
a
man
in
san
bernardino
to
cut
wood
on
land
claimed
by
the
indians
for
the
railroad
company
he
taking
the
share
on
the
profits
and
agreeing
to
pay
them
every
saturday
in
money
that
juan
morengo
took
some
belonging
to
the
indians
and
appropriated
it
to
his
own
use
that
the
contractor
did
not
pay
as
agreed
but
wished
the
indians
to
take
poor
flour
and
other
articles
at
a
great
price
there
may
be
some
exaggeration
of
the
causes
of
complaint
but
it
is
evident
that
no
one
has
looked
after
the
rights
of
these
indians
the
indians
have
stopped
cutting
the
wood
and
they
say
the
contractor
tells
them
he
will
send
others
to
cut
wood
if
they
will
not
do
it
if
i
understand
rightly
this
is
government
land
and
no
one
has
a
right
to
cut
the
timber
it
is
true
it
is
mesquite
timber
and
they
profess
to
cut
only
the
dry
trees
but
the
mesquite
is
invaluable
to
the
indians
it
not
only
makes
their
fires
but
its
fruit
supplies
them
with
a
large
amount
of
subsistence
the
mesquite
bean
is
used
green
and
dry
and
at
the
present
time
is
their
principal
article
of
food
moreover
without
the
mesquite
tree
the
valley
would
be
an
absolute
desert
the
wood
the
dead
trees
could
be
made
a
source
of
employment
and
profitable
revenue
to
the
indians
if
cut
with
proper
regulations
but
the
present
mode
is
destruction
to
the
timber
and
benefits
but
few
of
the
indians
i
have
extended
my
remarks
on
this
subject
as
i
think
it
very
important
if
the
wood
is
to
be
cut
the
indians
should
be
supplied
with
wagons
and
harness
that
they
may
do
all
the
work
of
delivering
the
wood
and
get
the
profit
of
their
labor
i
would
suggest
that
it
is
very
important
that
a
tract
of
country
be
segregated
and
set
apart
for
these
indians
there
is
a
vast
amount
of
desert
land
in
their
country
but
there
are
spots
in
it
that
have
been
occupied
by
them
for
hundreds
of
years
where
wheat
corn
melons
and
other
farm
products
can
be
grown
there
is
very
little
running
water
but
water
is
so
near
the
surface
that
it
can
be
easily
developed
the
indians
appear
to
know
nothing
of
any
lands
being
set
apart
for
them
but
claim
the
whole
territory
they
have
always
occupied
i
think
that
to
avoid
complications
something
should
be
done
for
these
indians
immediately
to
protect
their
interests
at
present
there
are
eight
villages
or
rancherias
each
with
its
own
captain
but
all
recognizing
old
cabezon
as
head
chief
i
ascertained
from
each
captain
the
number
belonging
to
his
village
and
i
found
the
aggregate
to
be
souls
these
indians
are
not
what
are
called
christianized
indians
they
never
belonged
to
the
missions
and
have
never
been
received
into
any
church
they
believe
in
spirits
and
witchcraft
while
i
was
among
them
i
was
told
by
a
white
man
that
the
indians
intended
to
kill
one
of
their
number
because
he
had
bewitched
a
man
and
made
him
sick
i
asked
the
interpreter
about
it
he
acknowledged
it
to
be
true
but
said
they
only
intended
to
frighten
him
so
that
he
would
let
the
man
alone
i
told
him
it
would
be
wrong
to
kill
the
indian
and
he
said
they
would
not
do
it
they
are
very
anxious
to
have
schools
established
amongst
them
and
are
willing
to
all
live
in
one
village
if
a
suitable
place
can
be
selected
i
shall
offer
as
my
opinion
that
immediate
steps
should
be
taken
to
set
apart
lands
for
these
indians
that
they
be
permitted
to
cut
wood
for
sale
only
on
the
public
lands
in
cabezon
valley
that
no
one
be
permitted
to
cut
any
green
timber
in
the
valley
that
two
strong
wagons
and
harness
for
twelve
horses
be
furnished
or
loaned
to
the
indians
for
the
purpose
of
hauling
wood
only
that
lumber
be
furnished
to
make
sheds
for
said
wagons
and
harness
the
indians
have
horses
of
their
own
all
of
which
is
respectfully
submitted
stanley
exhibit
o
the
san
gorgonio
reservation
this
is
the
only
reservation
of
any
size
or
value
in
southern
california
it
lies
in
the
san
gorgonio
pass
between
the
san
bernardino
and
san
jacinto
mountains
the
southern
pacific
railroad
passes
throughout
it
it
is
a
large
tract
including
a
considerable
proportion
of
three
townships
it
is
in
an
exposed
situation
open
to
the
desert
winds
and
very
hot
in
summer
a
small
white
settlement
called
banning
lies
in
this
district
most
of
the
titles

a

from

and
lay
before
the
commissioners
a
statement
of
the
existing
status
of
the

reserved
for
indian
purposes
as
affecting
the
citizens
resident
on
those
townships
known
as
and
and
in
san
bernardino
meridian
believing
that
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
that
you
should
become
conversant
with
facts
affecting
the
condition
and
future
of
the
indians
whom
it
is
designed
to
place
upon
these
lands
we
respectfully
request
a
hearing
among
those
facts
as
affecting
the
residents
directly
and
more
remotely
the
indians
are
the
following
there
is
in
san
gorgonio
township
of
which
these
lands
are
a
part
a
population
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
souls
in
township
is
the
village
of
banning
which
is
the
business
centre
of
the
surrounding
country
and
has
an
immediately
surrounding
population
numbering
fifty
souls
it
has
post
and
express
offices
railroad
depot
district
school
church
organization
general
merchandise
store
the
flume
of
the
san
gorgonio
fluming
company
two
magistrates
and
during
the
last
year
there
was
sold
or
shipped
from
this
place
alone
fully
bushels
of
wheat
and
barley
over
tons
of
baled
hay
a
large
amount
of
honey
butter
eggs
poultry
live
stock
besides
cords
of
wood
although
more
than
half
of
the
area
of
this
township
is
in
the
mountains
and
uninhabited
from
the
remaining
portion
which
is
surveyed
land
there
is
at
this
time
fully
acres
in
grain
and
the
value
of
the
improved
property
is
over
exclusive
of
railroad
property
vested
interests
have
been
acquired
to
all
the
water
available
for
irrigation
under
the
code
of
laws
existing
in
this
state
wells
have
repeatedly
been
dug
without
success
in
this
township
united
states
patents
to
lands
were
granted
in
this
township
long
anterior
to
the
executive
order
reserving
the
lands
for
indian
purposes
and
since
then
the
population
has
not
increased
no
indian
has
within
the
memory
of
man
resided
in
this
township
there
are
not
over
two
entire
sections
of
land
in
the
entire
area
left
available
for
cultivation
and
on
these
without
abundance
of
water
no
one
could
possibly
succeed
in
earning
a
livelihood
one
of
these
sections
was
occupied
and
was
abandoned
the
attempt
to
raise
a
cereal
crop
having
failed
the
extreme
aridity
of
the
climate
renders
the
successful
growth
of
cereals
problematical
even
when
summer
fallowing
is
pursued
and
the
amount
of
human
casualty
possessed
by
the
average
indian
does
not
usually
embrace
the
period
of
two
years
to
intersperse
indians
between
white
settlers
who
own
the
railroad
land
or
odd
sections
and
the
remaining
portions
of
the
government
sections
where
a
no
fence
law
exists
as
here
would
not
be
conducive
to
the
of
the
indians
and
would
result
in
a
depreciation
of
our
property
alike
needless
and
disastrous
in
township
there
are
not
over
eighty
acres
available
in
weaver
creek
cañon
where
the
water
was
acquired
and
utilized
before
the
executive
order
and
the
legal
right
well
established
in
township
settlements
were
made
many
years
before
the
issue
of
the
order
of
reservation
especially
on
sections
or
railroad
lands
as
then
supposed
to
be
and
these
settlers
have
acquired
claims
in
equity
to
their
improvements
on
one
ranch
in
this
township
of
smith
stewart
who
have
cultivated
and
improved
the
mesa
or
bench
lands
was
produced
several
thousand
sacks
of
grain
but
this
involved
such
an
outlay
of
capital
and
knowledge
beside
experience
in
such
as
indians
do
not
possess
in
this
township
embracing
the
three
mentioned
there
are
upward
of
forty
voters
and
these
unanimously
and
respectfully
ask
you
to
grant
us
a

you
may
be

there
is
upon

a

there
are
also
on

several
small
but
good
one
of
these
springs
with
the
adjacent
land
is
occupied
by
an
indian
village
called
the
potrero
numbering
about
sixty
souls
industrious
little
community
with
a
good
amount
of
land
fenced
and
under
cultivation
these
indians
are
in
great
trouble
on
account
of
their
stock
the
approaches
to
their
having
been
by
degrees
all
fenced
off
by
white
settlers
leaving
the
indians
no
place
where
they
can
run
their
cattle
without
risk
of
being
corralled
and
kept
till
fines
are
paid
for
their
release
all
the
other
springs
except
this
one
are
held
by
white
settlers
who
with
one
exception
we
were
informed
have
all
come
on
within
the
past
five
years
they
claim
however
to
have
bought
the
rights
of
former
settlers
one
of
the
largest
blocks
of
this
reservation
lies
upon
the
san
bernardino
mountain
and
is
a
fair
it
is
now
used
for
this
purpose
by
a
man
named
hyler
the
next
largest
available
block
of
land
on
the
reservation
is
now
under
tillage
by
the
dry
system
by
the
firm
of

there
is
also
a
on
the
reservation
belonging
to
herron
wilson
one
of
the
springs
and
the
land
adjacent
are
held
by
a
man
named
jost
he
is
on
unsurveyed
land
but
claims
that
by
private
survey
he
has
ascertained
that
he
is
on
an
section
and
has
made
application
to
the
railroad
for
the
same
he
requested
us
to
submit
to
the
department
his
estimate
of
the
value
of
his
improvements
it
is
appended
to
this
exhibit
it
seems
plain
from
the
above
facts
and
from
the
letter
of
the
banning
gentleman
that
a
considerable
number
of
indians
could
be
advantageously
placed
on
this
reservation
if
the
whites
were
removed
it
would
be
necessary
to
acquire
whatever
titles
there
may
be
to
tracts
included
in
the
reservation
also
to
develop
the
water
by
the
construction
of
reservoirs
probably
to
purchase
some
small
estimating
roughly
we
would
say
by
an
expenditure
of
from
to
this
reservation
could
be
rounded
out
and
put
into
readiness
for
indians
it
ought
to
be
most
emphatically
stated
and
distinctly
understood
that
without
some
such
preparation
as
this
in
the
matter
of
and
channels
the
indians
can
not
be
put
there
it
is
hardly
possible
for
one
unfamiliar
with
the
southern
california
country
to
fully
understand
how
necessary
this
is
without
irrigation
the
greater
portion
of
the
land
is
worthless
and
all
arrangements
for
developing
economizing
and
distributing
water
are
costly
this
is
an
objection
to
the
san
gorgonio
reservation
there
are
two
others
the
indians
for
the
most
part
have
an
exceeding
dislike
to
the
region
and
will
never
go
there
voluntarily
only
by
force
the
alternative
of
railroad
sections
with
the
sections
of
the
reservations
will
surely
lead
to
troubles
in
the
future
between
the
white
settlers
and
the
indians
these
are
serious
objections
but
it
is
the
only
large
block
of

the
government
has
left
