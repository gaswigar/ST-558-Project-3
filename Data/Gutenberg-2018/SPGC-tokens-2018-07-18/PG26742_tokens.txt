chapter
i
treading
on
new
ground
that
last
sabbath
of
august
was
a
lovely
day
it
was
the
first
sabbath
that
our
girls
had
spent
at
home
since
the
revelation
of
chautauqua
it
seemed
lovely
to
them
the
world
looks
as
though
it
was
made
over
new
in
the
night
eurie
had
said
as
she
threw
open
her
blinds
and
drew
in
whiffs
of
the
sweet
soft
air
and
the
church
whither
these
girls
had
so
often
betaken
themselves
on
summer
mornings
just
like
this
one
how
two
or
three
weeks
have
changed
it
they
could
not
feel
that
it
was
the
same
building
hitherto
it
had
been
to
them
simply
the
first
church
grander
by
several
degrees
than
any
other
church
in
the
city
having
the
finest
choir
and
the
finest
organ
and
the
most
elegant
carpets
and
making
the
grandest
floral
display
of
all
the
temples
as
became
the
first
church
of
course
but
this
glowing
glorious
august
day
it
was
something
infinitely
above
and
beyond
all
this
it
was
the
visible
temple
of
the
invisible
god
saviour
and
they
were
going
up
to
worship
aye
really
and
truly
to
they
in
their
different
ways
according
to
their
very
different
natures
felt
this
and
were
thrilled
with
it
as
their
feet
trod
the
aisles
people
can
feel
a
great
many
things
and
not
show
them
to
the
casual
observer
sitting
in
their
respective
pews
they
looked
in
no
sense
different
from
the
way
they
had
looked
on
a
hundred
different
sabbaths
before
this
ruth
erskine
in
the
corner
of
her
father
pew
attired
as
she
had
often
been
before
in
the
most
delicate
and
exquisite
of
summer
silks
with
exactly
the
right
shade
of
necktie
gloves
and
sash
to
set
off
the
beauty
of
the
dress
with
the
soft
and
delicate
laces
about
her
white
throat
for
which
she
was
especially
noted
looked
not
one
whit
different
from
the
lady
who
sat
there
three
weeks
before
you
have
known
that
her
heart
was
singing
for
joy
flossy
shipley
aglow
with
elegance
as
she
always
was
looked
the
same
airy
butterfly
that
had
flitted
in
and
out
of
that
church
on
many
a
summer
day
before
and
marion
in
her
corner
in
the
gallery
was
simply
the
grave
somewhat
at
one
of
the
wards
a
girl
with
infidel
tendencies
that
is
all
the
great
congregation
knew
about
her
in
fact
comparatively
few
of
them
knew
even
that
eurie
mitchell
was
the
doctor
eldest
daughter
and
had
in
no
sense
improved
as
to
her
toilet
a
thing
which
could
hardly
be
expected
since
she
had
thrown
away
so
much
money
on
that
wild
scheme
of
living
in
the
woods
that
was
what
some
of
the
congregation
thought
about
her
dennis
saw
all
these
girls
and
looked
gloomy
over
them
he
was
in
the
mood
to
need
sympathetic
hearers
to
long
to
be
in
accord
with
his
audience
and
feel
that
they
could
sympathize
with
him
in
his
reach
after
a
higher
type
of
religion
what
could
these
four
girls
know
about
a
higher
type
when
they
had
no
religion
at
all
and
had
been
spending
two
lawless
weeks
in
looking
at
the
subject
till
their
hearts
were
either
attuned
to
ridicule
or
disgusted
according
to
their
several
temperaments
that
was
what
the
faces
of
our
four
girls
said
to
him
yet
how
they
listened
to
his
sermon
i
shall
be
satisfied
when
i
awake
with
thy
likeness
these
were
the
words
on
which
he
spoke
and
the
burden
of
his
thought
was
that
satisfaction
was
not
to
be
sought
for
here
nothing
less
than
the
absolute
should
give
absolute
satisfaction
and
this
likeness
was
to
be
forever
eagerly
earnestly
constantly
sought
for
striven
after
until
some
day
would
come
that
blessed
awakening
and
the
picture
would
be
found
to
be
complete
was
it
the
best
sermon
that
had
ever
been
preached
was
it
the
spiritual
sermon
that
the
first
church
people
had
ever
heard
or
was
it
that
four
girls
had
been
to
chautauqua
and
there
learned
how
to
listen
their
cheeks
glowed
and
their
eyes
dilated
over
the
wonderful
thoughts
that
the
subject
presented
the
endless
possibility
for
climbing
marion
wilbur
had
been
counted
ambitious
she
had
longed
for
a
chance
to
reach
high
here
was
her
chance
she
felt
it
and
gloried
in
it
she
meant
to
try
every
nerve
quivered
with
the
determination
and
the
satisfaction
of
realizing
that
she
belonged
to
the
great
royal
family
no
more
obscurity
for
her
she
was
a
child
of
the
king
and
the
kingdom
was
in
view
a
crown
aglow
with
jewels
nothing
less
must
satisfy
her
now
the
sermon
over
the
hymn
sung
and
amid
the
pealing
of
the
organ
as
it
played
the
worshipers
down
the
aisles
our
four
girls
met
they
knew
each
other
determination
the
next
thing
to
do
was
to
go
to
but
i
suppose
you
have
no
idea
how
strangely
they
felt
how
much
it
seemed
to
them
as
if
they
were
children
who
had
come
to
a
party
uninvited
and
as
if
they
must
at
this
last
minute
hide
their
heads
and
run
home
the
very
effort
to
go
up
to
the
room
seemed
too
much
a
cross
to
undertake
there
were
so
many
to
stare
and
look
their
amazement
there
was
no
one
to
go
with
nobody
to
think
of
such
a
thing
as
asking
them
to
go
it
would
have
been
so
much
less
awkward
if
they
could
have
followed
in
the
lead
of
one
who
had
said
wo
you
come
up
and
see
our
the
superintendent
passed
them
as
they
stood
irresolute
he
bowed
courteously
and
no
more
thought
of
asking
them
to
join
him
than
though
they
had
been
birds
of
brilliant
plumage
flying
by
dennis
passed
them
said
not
gladly
not
even
graciously
he
dreaded
those
girls
and
their
undoubted
influence
they
had
not
the
least
idea
how
much
mischief
they
had
done
him
in
the
way
of
frittering
away
his
influence
heretofore
how
should
they
know
that
he
dreaded
them
on
the
other
hand
how
was
he
to
know
that
they
absolutely
longed
for
him
to
take
them
by
the
hand
and
say
come
they
looked
at
him
curiously
as
he
passed
and
eurie
said
does
it
make
your
heart
beat
to
think
of
going
to
him
in
his
study
and
having
a
private
talk
dear
me
said
flossy
i
never
shall
think
of
such
a
thing
i
do
it
any
more
than
i
could
fly
there
are
harder
things
than
that
to
do
i
suspect
and
it
will
come
to
a
visit
to
his
study
if
we
are
to
unite
with
the
church
do
you
know
that
is
what
he
always
asks
of
those
and
then
these
girls
looked
absolutely
blank
for
to
two
of
them
the
thought
of
that
duty
had
never
occurred
before
they
did
not
understand
it
well
enough
to
know
that
it
was
a
privilege
well
said
eurie
rallying
first
of
course
are
we
to
stand
here
gazing
around
us
all
day
because
nobody
knows
enough
to
invite
us
to
go
it
is
clear
that
we
are
not
to
be
invited
they
are
all
come
all
the
people
and
hark
why
they
are
singing
dear
me
said
flossy
then
it
is
commenced
i
hate
to
go
in
when
it
is
commenced
how
very
unfortunate
this
is
serves
us
right
said
marion
we
ought
to
be
in
a
condition
to
invite
others
instead
of
waiting
here
to
be
invited
i
tell
you
what
girls
if
we
ever
get
to
feel
that
we
belong
let
constitute
ourselves
a
committee
to
see
after
timid
strangers
like
ourselves
and
give
them
a
at
least
well
said
ruth
speaking
for
the
first
time
shall
we
go
home
and
wait
till
next
sunday
and
take
a
fair
start
as
flossy
says
it
pleasant
to
go
in
after
the
exercises
have
fairly
opened
as
she
said
this
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
miss
ruth
erskine
began
to
have
a
dim
idea
that
possibly
she
might
be
a
coward
this
certainly
sounded
a
little
like
it
each
waited
to
get
a
bit
of
advice
from
the
other
both
marion
and
eurie
it
must
be
confessed
bold
spirits
that
they
were
so
dreaded
this
ordeal
that
each
hoped
the
other
would
advise
retreat
as
the
wisest
thing
to
be
done
next
it
was
flossy
who
spoke
i
am
going
up
now
it
wo
be
any
easier
next
sunday
and
i
want
to
begin
there
said
eurie
that
is
just
what
i
needed
to
shame
me
into
common
sense
what
a
company
of
idiots
we
are
marion
what
would
you
think
of
a
who
would
stand
shivering
outside
your
doors
for
this
length
of
time
now
come
on
all
of
you
and
she
led
the
way
how
very
awkward
it
was
it
was
during
the
opening
prayer
that
they
arrived
and
they
had
to
stand
by
the
door
and
be
peeped
at
by
irreverent
children
then
they
had
to
invite
themselves
to
a
vacant
seat
near
the
door
the
superintendent
came
that
way
presently
and
said
young
ladies
so
you
have
come
in
to
visit
our
school
glad
to
see
you
it
is
a
pleasant
place
i
think
you
will
find
that
is
extremely
doubtful
eurie
said
in
undertone
as
he
passed
on
how
the
children
did
stare
they
are
certainly
unused
to
visitors
ruth
said
growing
uncomfortable
under
such
prolonged
gazing
what
is
the
use
of
all
this
girls
we
might
better
be
at
home
if
we
had
grown
up
here
eurie
said
bravely
we
should
probably
have
our
place
by
this
time
it
all
comes
of
our
graceful
lives
but
i
must
say
they
make
it
very
easy
for
people
to
stay
away
why
on
earth
they
invite
us
to
go
into
bible
classes
what
right
have
they
to
take
it
for
granted
that
we
came
out
of
pure
curiosity
the
business
of
the
hour
went
on
and
our
girls
were
still
left
unmolested
as
the
newness
wore
somewhat
away
the
situation
began
to
grow
funny
they
could
see
that
the
pastor
and
the
superintendent
were
engaged
in
anxious
conversation
to
judge
by
the
gravity
of
their
faces
and
as
their
eyes
occasionally
roved
in
that
direction
it
was
natural
to
suppose
they
were
discussing
the
unexpected
visitors
could
they
have
heard
the
anxious
talk
it
would
have
been
a
solemn
comment
on
their
reputations
that
morris
class
is
vacant
again
the
superintendent
was
saying
i
do
know
what
we
are
to
do
with
that
class
no
one
is
willing
to
undertake
it
the
pastor
looked
toward
his
own
large
class
waiting
for
him
and
said
with
a
weary
sigh
i
believe
i
shall
have
to
give
up
my
class
to
some
one
and
take
that
i
do
want
to
it
is
a
class
which
requires
more
nervous
energy
than
i
have
at
command
at
this
hour
of
the
day
but
what
is
to
be
done
with
them
would
it
do
to
ask
one
of
the
young
ladies
on
the
visitors
seat
and
then
the
eyes
of
the
two
men
turned
toward
the
girls
they
are
afraid
of
us
whispered
eurie
her
propensity
to
see
the
ludicrous
side
of
things
in
no
whit
destroyed
by
her
conversion
look
at
their
troubled
faces
they
think
that
we
are
harbingers
of
mischief
oh
me
what
a
reputation
to
have
but
i
declare
it
is
funny
whereupon
she
laughed
softly
but
unmistakably
it
was
at
this
moment
that
dennis
eyes
rested
on
her
oh
they
are
only
here
for
material
to
make
sport
of
he
said
gloomily
miss
erskine
might
keep
the
boys
quiet
for
awhile
if
she
chose
to
do
so
i
suppose
or
miss
wilbur
some
of
the
boys
in
that
class
are
in
school
in
her
ward
they
say
she
has
grand
order
dennis
face
grew
stern
no
he
said
do
ask
at
least
we
will
not
put
them
in
a
way
to
learn
error
if
we
can
teach
them
nothing
good
miss
wilbur
is
an
infidel
i
do
know
what
is
to
be
done
with
that
class
as
you
say
poor
morris
i
am
afraid
will
never
be
able
to
take
it
again
and
he
was
utterly
discouraged
with
them
anyway
they
get
no
good
here
that
i
can
see
and
they
certainly
do
infinite
mischief
to
the
rest
of
the
school
but
at
the
same
time
i
suppose
we
can
not
send
them
away
oh
certainly
not
well
suppose
you
try
if
miss
erskine
will
sit
there
and
try
to
awe
them
by
her
dignity
for
awhile
and
this
week
we
must
see
what
can
be
done
she
wo
try
it
though
i
presume
it
ended
in
the
superintendent
coming
toward
them
at
last
he
like
to
be
too
personal
in
his
request
so
he
took
the
general
way
of
putting
a
question
resting
in
the
belief
that
each
would
refuse
and
that
then
he
could
press
the
task
on
miss
erskine
we
are
short
of
teachers
would
one
of
you
be
willing
to
sit
with
that
class
at
your
right
and
try
to
interest
them
a
little
they
are
a
sad
set
very
little
can
be
done
with
them
but
we
have
to
try
i
shall
have
to
confess
that
both
ruth
and
marion
were
appalled
the
one
shrank
as
much
as
the
other
if
it
had
been
a
class
in
mathematics
or
philosophy
marion
would
have
been
confident
of
her
powers
but
she
felt
so
very
ignorant
of
the
bible
she
had
come
in
hoping
and
expecting
a
chance
to
slip
into
a
grand
bible
class
where
she
might
learn
some
of
the
inner
truths
of
that
glorious
lesson
that
she
had
been
trying
to
study
but
to
teach
it
this
seemed
impossible
as
for
ruth
no
thought
of
such
an
experience
had
as
yet
come
to
her
they
therefore
maintained
a
dismayed
silence
eurie
was
frank
i
ca
teach
she
said
i
do
understand
it
myself
i
have
the
least
idea
what
to
say
to
anyone
about
the
bible
lesson
and
then
they
all
turned
and
stared
in
a
maze
of
surprise
and
perplexity
at
little
flossy
i
would
like
to
try
she
said
simply
i
have
thought
about
the
lesson
all
the
week
i
am
not
sure
that
i
can
anything
but
i
should
like
to
talk
the
story
over
with
them
if
they
will
let
me
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
lead
this
exquisite
bit
of
flesh
and
blood
in
her
dainty
summer
toilet
before
that
rough
and
rollicking
class
of
boys
old
enough
some
of
them
to
be
called
young
men
but
without
an
idea
as
to
the
manner
of
conduct
that
should
honor
that
name
it
would
be
hard
to
tell
which
was
the
most
amazed
and
embarrassed
the
superintendent
or
the
girls
whom
flossy
left
looking
after
her
they
were
quite
sobered
now
they
did
not
want
flossy
to
come
to
grief
a
tender
feeling
that
was
new
and
sweet
had
sprung
up
in
the
heart
of
each
of
them
toward
her
that
innocent
little
kitten
knows
no
more
what
she
has
undertaken
than
if
she
were
a
dove
said
marion
dismay
and
discomfort
struggling
in
her
face
why
she
might
as
well
be
daniel
in
the
den
of
lions
well
said
eurie
speaking
gravely
he
came
out
all
right
you
know
then
she
hailed
the
passing
superintendent
stuart
is
there
a
bible
class
that
we
can
go
in
we
did
come
to
look
on
we
want
to
study
the
lesson
oh
why
yes
certainly
stuart
said
stammering
and
looking
unutterable
astonishment
where
would
they
like
to
go
there
were
two
vacant
seats
in
pembrook
class
and
one
in
judge
elmore
ruth
instantly
chose
judge
elmore
and
left
marion
and
eurie
to
make
their
way
to
the
vacant
places
in
pembrook
class
the
young
ladies
of
the
class
moved
along
and
made
room
for
the
new
comers
and
the
teacher
carefully
told
them
what
chapter
and
verse
were
being
studied
they
found
their
places
and
pembrook
searched
laboriously
for
his
he
had
lost
the
spot
on
his
lesson
leaf
where
he
had
read
the
last
question
and
he
was
all
at
sea
let
me
see
he
said
where
we
none
of
them
seemed
to
know
at
least
they
gave
him
no
information
one
of
them
tried
to
button
a
glove
that
was
too
small
for
her
one
yawned
behind
her
bible
and
the
most
utter
indifference
in
regard
to
the
lesson
or
the
school
seemed
to
prevail
oh
said
pembrook
here
is
where
we
were
i
was
just
reading
the
thirtieth
verse
he
spake
these
words
many
believed
on
him
who
spake
them
jesus
one
answered
speaking
the
word
with
a
yawn
what
did
jesus
say
next
the
next
young
lady
thus
appealed
to
hurriedly
looked
up
the
place
in
her
bible
and
read
said
jesus
to
those
jews
which
believed
on
him
if
ye
continue
in
my
word
then
are
ye
my
disciples
indeed
well
said
pembrook
after
a
thoughtful
pause
there
does
seem
to
be
anything
to
say
on
that
verse
it
is
all
there
will
read
the
next
verse
now
the
you
whom
he
timidly
addressed
was
our
marion
she
understand
even
now
why
her
heart
should
have
throbbed
so
strangely
and
her
voice
trembled
as
she
read
aloud
the
simple
words
ye
shall
know
the
truth
and
the
truth
shall
make
you
free
free
from
what
she
asked
abruptly
the
class
stared
clearly
the
art
of
asking
questions
was
an
unknown
accomplishment
in
that
class
pembrook
looked
at
her
through
his
glasses
then
he
pushed
his
glasses
up
on
his
forehead
finally
he
took
them
off
and
rubbed
them
carefully
with
the
skirt
of
his
coat
before
he
essayed
to
answer
why
my
dear
young
lady
i
suppose
it
means
free
from
sin
the
lord
jesus
christ
was
speaking
to
his
people
you
know
to
christian
people
are
christian
people
free
from
sin
there
was
no
note
of
cavil
in
marion
voice
her
eyes
were
earnest
and
serious
and
she
waited
as
one
waits
in
honest
perplexity
to
have
a
puzzle
solved
but
she
was
known
as
one
who
held
dangerous
even
infidel
notions
and
pembrook
bewildered
as
to
how
to
answer
her
seemed
to
feel
that
probably
a
rebuke
was
what
she
needed
it
is
not
for
us
to
find
fault
with
the
words
of
the
lord
jesus
christ
my
dear
young
lady
he
spoke
them
and
they
must
mean
what
they
say
we
are
to
accept
them
in
all
sincerity
and
humility
remembering
that
what
we
know
not
now
we
shall
know
hereafter
that
is
the
way
to
do
and
then
he
cleared
his
throat
and
asked
the
next
young
lady
to
read
the
next
verse
two
bright
spots
glowed
on
marion
cheeks
she
bent
her
head
low
over
her
bible
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
she
kept
a
rush
of
tears
from
filling
her
eyes
had
she
seemed
to
cavil
at
the
words
of
her
lord
when
she
simply
longed
with
all
her
soul
to
understand
the
promise
mean
you
shall
be
free
from
sin
had
she
a
right
to
look
forward
to
and
hope
for
the
time
when
sin
should
have
no
more
dominion
then
that
other
sentence
in
my
work
just
what
did
it
mean
could
one
who
was
searching
it
eagerly
and
prayerfully
and
trying
to
abide
by
its
directions
be
said
to
be
continuing
in
it
there
were
a
dozen
questions
that
she
longed
to
ask
she
had
sought
the
this
morning
in
search
of
help
she
felt
blind
and
lame
unable
to
take
a
step
in
any
direction
lest
in
her
ignorance
she
should
err
as
already
she
had
something
in
her
way
of
speaking
of
these
things
must
be
radically
wrong
she
had
misled
this
good
man
it
was
no
use
to
ask
questions
as
the
lesson
progressed
there
appeared
other
reasons
why
she
need
not
question
him
clearly
the
good
man
knew
nothing
about
his
lesson
save
the
questions
contained
on
the
bit
of
paper
before
him
it
was
entirely
evident
that
he
had
not
looked
at
the
verses
nor
thought
of
them
until
he
came
before
his
class
it
was
equally
plain
that
his
scholars
were
entirely
accustomed
to
this
state
of
things
and
were
careful
to
follow
his
example
he
could
read
a
question
at
them
from
his
lesson
paper
and
they
could
read
an
answer
back
to
him
from
their
bibles
and
this
was
all
that
either
party
expected
of
the
other
why
these
young
ladies
continued
to
come
sabbath
after
sabbath
and
go
over
this
weary
routine
of
question
and
answer
was
a
mystery
to
marion
she
came
away
from
the
school
in
a
most
uncomfortable
frame
of
mind
that
to
which
she
had
looked
forward
all
the
week
had
proved
a
disappointment
and
a
failure
she
was
almost
inclined
to
say
that
she
would
have
no
more
to
do
with
that
they
really
were
the
humbug
that
she
had
always
supposed
them
imagine
my
going
to
a
philosophy
class
knowing
no
more
about
the
lesson
than
that
old
man
did
she
said
to
eurie
as
they
walked
down
to
the
corner
of
elm
street
together
i
know
said
eurie
speaking
with
unusual
thoughtfulness
but
suppose
you
dull
in
the
class
if
it
were
known
after
all
that
you
could
make
the
most
brilliant
philosophical
experiments
you
would
probably
be
listened
to
with
respect
what
do
you
mean
asked
marion
bewildered
why
i
mean
that
deacon
pembrook
can
perform
the
experiments
successfully
in
other
words
to
come
down
to
your
comprehension
he
succeeds
in
living
so
pure
and
careful
a
christian
life
that
he
has
the
respect
and
confidence
of
everybody
what
if
he
ca
preach
he
can
practice
however
i
am
willing
to
admit
that
the
dear
old
man
would
be
more
edifying
if
he
would
study
his
lesson
a
little
was
it
funny
to
think
of
calling
that
and
then
this
volatile
young
lady
laughed
but
her
moralizing
had
done
marion
good
she
said
more
cheerily
and
went
on
her
way
thinking
over
the
many
things
that
she
had
heard
in
honor
of
deacon
pembrook
so
that
by
the
time
she
had
reached
her
although
his
teaching
would
certainly
make
a
very
poor
show
yet
his
sweet
christian
life
had
come
up
to
plead
for
him
and
marion
was
forced
to
feel
that
the
truth
had
made
him
free
but
it
is
a
real
pity
not
to
study
his
lesson
she
said
as
she
went
about
her
room
those
girls
did
get
a
single
idea
to
help
them
in
any
way
some
of
them
need
ideas
badly
enough
two
or
three
of
them
are
members
of
the
church
i
am
sure
that
allie
march
is
but
she
has
no
ideas
on
subject
you
can
see
that
in
the
grammar
class
and
then
marion
remembered
that
allie
march
was
in
grammar
class
and
allie
was
a
professed
christian
could
help
her
it
was
not
pride
in
marion
but
she
had
to
smile
at
the
thought
of
herself
being
helped
by
so
very
a
brain
as
that
which
allie
march
possessed
and
then
she
paused
with
her
hand
on
the
door
and
her
face
glowed
at
the
new
and
surprising
thought
that
just
then
came
to
her
would
it
not
be
possible
for
her
marion
wilbur
to
help
allie
march
even
in
her
christian
life
all
that
afternoon
though
she
went
about
or
sat
down
in
her
room
with
a
sense
of
loneliness
no
one
to
speak
to
who
could
understand
and
would
believe
in
her
even
in
the
they
were
afraid
of
her
how
could
she
help
or
be
helped
while
this
state
of
things
lasted
it
was
in
the
early
twilight
that
as
she
sat
with
her
hat
and
sack
on
waiting
for
eurie
who
had
engaged
to
call
for
her
to
go
to
church
she
strayed
across
a
verse
or
two
in
her
new
possession
the
bible
that
touched
the
point
it
was
where
saul
essayed
to
join
himself
to
the
disciples
but
they
were
all
afraid
of
him
and
believed
not
that
he
was
a
disciple
her
experience
precisely
they
were
afraid
of
her
influence
afraid
of
her
tongue
afraid
of
her
example
and
indeed
what
reason
had
they
to
feel
otherwise
but
she
read
on
that
blessed
verse
wherein
it
says
but
barnabas
took
him
and
brought
him
to
the
apostles
and
declared
unto
them
how
he
had
seen
the
lord
in
the
way
and
that
he
had
spoken
to
him
she
was
reading
this
for
the
second
time
when
eurie
came
see
here
eurie
read
this
she
said
as
she
passed
her
the
bible
and
made
her
final
preparations
for
church
is
that
our
experience
i
mean
i
think
it
to
be
ours
judging
from
as
a
foretaste
they
will
be
afraid
of
us
and
believe
not
that
we
are
disciples
eurie
laughed
a
quick
little
laugh
that
had
an
undertone
of
feeling
in
it
as
she
said
well
then
i
hope
we
shall
find
a
barnabas
to
vouch
for
us
before
long
and
marion
knew
that
she
too
felt
the
loneliness
and
the
sense
of
belonging
to
no
one
we
must
help
each
other
very
much
we
girls
this
she
said
to
herself
as
they
went
down
the
steps
together

chapter
ii
flossy
begins
flossy
shipley
first
day
at
was
different
she
went
over
to
the
class
of
boys
who
were
almost
young
men
with
trepidation
indeed
and
yet
with
an
assured
sort
of
feeling
that
they
would
be
quiet
just
how
she
was
going
to
accomplish
this
she
was
not
certain
she
had
studied
the
words
of
the
lesson
most
carefully
and
prayerfully
indeed
they
had
been
more
in
her
mind
all
the
week
than
had
anything
else
at
the
same
time
she
by
no
means
understood
how
to
teach
those
words
and
thoughts
to
the
style
of
young
men
who
were
now
before
her
still
there
was
that
in
flossy
which
always
held
the
attention
of
the
young
men
she
knew
this
to
be
the
case
and
without
understanding
what
her
peculiar
power
was
she
felt
that
she
had
it
and
believed
that
she
could
call
it
into
service
for
this
new
work
they
stared
at
her
a
little
as
she
took
her
seat
then
they
nudged
each
other
and
giggled
and
looked
down
at
their
dusty
boots
guiltless
of
any
attempt
at
being
black
and
shuffled
them
in
a
way
to
make
a
disagreeable
noise
they
knew
flossy
that
is
they
knew
what
street
she
lived
on
and
how
the
outside
of
her
father
house
looked
and
what
her
standing
in
society
was
they
knew
nothing
of
her
in
the
capacity
of
a
teacher
and
truth
to
tell
they
did
not
believe
she
teach
she
was
a
doll
set
up
before
them
for
them
to
admire
and
pretend
to
listen
to
they
did
not
intend
to
do
it
she
had
nothing
in
common
with
them
they
had
a
right
to
make
her
uncomfortable
if
they
could
and
they
were
sure
that
they
could
this
was
the
mood
in
which
she
found
them
she
said
brightly
and
they
glanced
at
each
other
and
shuffled
their
feet
louder
and
some
of
them
chuckled
louder
while
one
of
them
said
it
rather
late
in
the
morning
ai
it
we
got
up
quite
a
spell
ago
this
passed
for
a
joke
and
they
laughed
aloud
at
this
point
flossy
caught
dennis
distressed
face
turned
that
way
it
was
not
reassuring
he
evidently
expected
disastrous
times
in
that
corner
flossy
ignored
the
discourteous
treatment
of
her
and
opened
her
bible
do
you
know
she
said
with
a
soft
little
laugh
that
i
have
the
least
idea
how
to
teach
a
lesson
i
never
did
such
a
thing
in
my
life
so
you
must
expect
wisdom
from
me
the
very
most
i
can
do
is
to
talk
the
matter
over
with
you
and
ask
you
what
you
think
about
it
whereupon
they
looked
at
each
other
again
and
laughed
but
this
time
it
was
a
puzzled
sort
of
laugh
this
was
a
new
experience
they
had
had
teachers
who
knew
extremely
little
about
the
lesson
and
proved
it
conclusively
but
never
once
did
they
it
their
plan
had
rather
been
to
assume
the
wisdom
of
solomon
and
in
no
particular
to
be
found
wanting
in
information
they
did
not
know
what
answer
to
make
to
flossy
have
you
bibles
she
asked
them
no
well
here
are
lesson
leaves
these
are
pieces
of
the
bible
i
suppose
are
they
nice
i
do
know
anything
about
them
i
have
never
been
in
you
see
not
since
i
was
a
little
girl
what
are
these
cards
for
please
now
they
understood
all
about
the
management
of
the
library
cards
and
the
method
of
giving
out
books
by
their
means
and
flossy
was
so
evidently
ignorant
and
so
puzzled
by
their
attempts
at
explanation
and
asked
so
many
questions
and
took
so
long
to
understand
it
that
they
really
became
very
much
interested
in
making
it
clear
to
her
and
then
in
helping
her
carry
out
the
programme
which
they
had
explained
and
everyone
of
them
had
a
queer
sense
of
relationship
to
the
school
that
they
had
not
possessed
before
they
knew
more
than
she
did
and
she
was
willing
to
own
it
now
about
this
lesson
she
said
at
last
i
really
do
see
how
people
teach
such
lessons
they
do
said
one
whom
they
called
rich
johnson
they
just
pretend
to
and
they
go
around
it
and
through
it
and
ask
baby
questions
and
pretend
that
they
know
a
great
deal
that
the
kind
of
teaching
that
we
are
used
to
flossy
laughed
you
wo
get
it
she
said
for
i
certainly
do
know
a
great
deal
and
i
do
know
how
to
pretend
that
i
do
but
i
like
to
read
about
this
talk
that
christ
had
with
the
people
and
i
should
have
liked
of
all
things
to
have
been
there
and
heard
him
i
would
like
to
go
now
to
the
place
where
he
was
would
you
like
to
go
to
jerusalem
what
an
awkward
way
they
had
of
looking
from
one
to
the
other
and
nudging
each
other
rich
johnson
seemed
to
be
the
speaker
for
the
class
he
spoke
now
in
a
gruff
unprepossessing
voice
i
enough
sight
rather
go
to
california
the
others
thought
this
a
joke
and
laughed
accordingly
flossy
caught
at
it
california
she
said
brightly
oh
i
been
there
i
do
wonder
that
you
want
to
go
it
is
a
grand
country
i
saw
some
of
those
great
trees
that
we
have
heard
about
illustration
flossy
laid
her
bible
in
her
lap
and
began

and
forthwith
she
launched
into
an
eager
description
of
the
mammoth
tree
and
as
they
leaned
forward
and
asked
now
and
then
an
intelligent
question
flossy
blessed
the
good
fortune
that
had
made
her
her
chosen
companion
on
his
hasty
trip
to
california
the
year
before
what
had
all
the
trees
in
california
to
do
with
the
lesson
nothing
of
course
but
flossy
saw
with
a
little
thrill
of
satisfaction
that
the
boys
were
becoming
interested
in
but
for
all
that
she
said
coming
back
suddenly
i
should
like
ever
so
much
to
go
to
jerusalem
i
felt
so
more
and
more
after
i
went
to
that
meeting
at
chautauqua
and
saw
the
city
all
laid
out
and
a
model
of
the
very
temple
you
know
where
jesus
was
when
he
spoke
these
words
they
did
not
laugh
this
time
on
the
contrary
they
looked
interested
she
could
describe
a
tree
perhaps
she
had
something
else
worth
hearing
what
that
said
rich
that
something
i
never
heard
of
and
then
flossy
laid
her
bible
in
her
lap
and
began
to
describe
the
living
picture
of
the
holy
land
as
she
had
seen
and
loved
it
at
chautauqua
of
course
you
know
that
she
did
well
was
not
her
heart
there
had
she
not
found
a
new
love
and
life
and
hope
while
she
walked
those
sunny
paths
that
led
to
bethany
and
to
the
mount
of
olives
every
one
of
the
boys
listened
and
some
of
them
questioned
and
rich
said
when
she
paused
well
now
that
an
idea
i
declare
i
would
mind
seeing
it
myself
and
to
each
one
of
them
came
a
glimmering
feeling
that
there
actually
such
a
city
as
jerusalem
and
such
a
person
as
jesus
christ
did
really
live
and
walk
and
talk
here
on
the
earth
then
flossy
took
up
her
bible
again
but
of
course
the
next
best
thing
to
going
to
places
and
actually
seeing
people
is
to
read
about
them
and
find
out
what
the
people
said
and
did
i
like
these
verses
especially
because
they
mean
us
as
well
as
those
to
whom
they
were
spoken
look
at
this
verse
i
have
been
all
the
week
over
it
and
i
do
see
but
i
shall
have
to
stay
over
it
all
my
life
said
jesus
if
ye
in
my
word
then
are
ye
my
disciples
indeed
just
think
how
far
that
reaches
all
through
the
words
of
jesus
so
many
of
them
so
many
things
to
do
and
so
many
to
do
and
then
not
only
to
begin
to
follow
them
but
to
day
after
day
getting
a
little
farther
and
knowing
a
little
more
after
all
it
very
fascinating
work
is
it
if
it
hard
like
climbing
a
mountain
one
gets
nearer
the
top
all
the
while
and
when
you
do
really
reach
the
top
how
splendid
it
is
or
doing
a
hard
piece
of
work
it
so
nice
to
get
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
end
of
it
and
feel
that
you
have
done
it
one
of
the
boys
yawned
it
was
not
so
interesting
as
the
description
of
the
miniature
jerusalem
one
of
them
looked
sarcastic
this
was
rich
do
you
suppose
there
ever
was
anybody
like
that
he
asked
and
the
most
lofty
incredulity
was
in
his
voice
like
what
why
that
followed
out
that
kind
of
talk
i
know
enough
about
the
bible
to
know
they
are
mighty
scarce
i
go
to
jerusalem
on
foot
to
see
a
real
one
where
the
folks
i
like
to
know
that
live
up
to
half
of
the
things
it
says
in
the
bible
why
they
even
say
it
be
done
and
that
why
it
seems
all
bosh
to
me
what
was
the
use
of
putting
it
in
there
if
it
ca
be
done
here
was
one
who
had
evidently
thought
and
thought
seriously
about
these
things
is
there
a
boy
of
seventeen
in
our
country
who
has
not
flossy
felt
timid
how
should
she
answer
the
sharp
sarcastic
words
he
had
been
studying
inconsistencies
and
had
grown
bitter
the
others
looked
on
curiously
they
had
a
certain
kind
of
pride
in
rich
he
was
their
genius
who
held
all
the
teachers
at
bay
with
his
ingenious
tongue
but
flossy
had
been
at
a
morning
meeting
in
chautauqua
where
there
was
talk
on
this
very
subject
it
came
back
to
her
now
as
for
being
to
do
it
she
said
quickly
i
do
feel
sure
that
we
have
anything
to
do
with
that
until
we
have
convinced
ourselves
that
we
have
been
just
as
good
as
we
possibly
could
honestly
now
do
you
think
you
have
been
no
said
promptly
of
course
not
and
what
is
more
i
never
pretended
that
i
was
well
i
know
have
been
i
am
perfectly
certain
that
in
a
hundred
ways
i
could
have
done
better
why
there
is
nothing
that
i
could
not
have
improved
upon
if
i
had
tried
so
by
our
own
confessions
what
right
have
you
and
i
to
stumble
over
not
being
able
to
be
perfect
so
long
as
we
have
not
begun
to
be
as
near
it
as
we
could
how
was
he
to
answer
this
oh
well
he
said
i
have
made
any
pretensions
i
talking
about
those
who
have
that
exactly
like
myself
and
as
nearly
as
i
can
see
we
both
belong
to
the
class
who
knew
our
duty
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
now
i
want
to
tell
you
that
i
have
decided
not
to
stand
with
that
class
any
longer
flossy
paused
an
instant
caught
her
breath
and
a
rich
flush
spread
over
her
pretty
face
this
was
her
first
actual
witnessing
outside
of
the
narrow
limits
of
her
intimate
three
friends
who
all
sympathized
i
gave
myself
to
this
jesus
when
i
was
at
chautauqua
i
said
to
him
that
i
had
stood
one
side
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
his
words
all
my
life
just
taken
his
favors
in
silence
and
indifference
but
that
for
the
future
i
was
to
belong
to
him
now
of
course
i
do
know
how
many
times
i
shall
fail
nor
how
many
things
i
shall
fail
in
the
most
i
know
is
that
i
mean
to
after
all
do
you
see
that
the
verse
does
say
if
you
are
but
simply
you
continue
now
if
i
am
trying
to
climb
a
hill
it
makes
a
difference
with
my
progress
to
be
sure
whether
i
stumble
and
fall
back
a
few
steps
now
and
then
but
for
all
that
i
may
continue
to
climb
and
if
i
do
i
shall
be
sure
to
reach
the
top
so
now
my
resolution
is
to
in
his
words
all
the
rest
of
my
life
she
did
not
ask
rich
to
do
the
same
she
said
not
a
word
to
him
about
himself
she
said
not
a
personal
word
to
one
of
them
but
every
boy
there
felt
himself
asked
to
join
her
more
than
that
not
a
boy
of
them
but
respected
her
it
is
wonderful
after
all
how
rarely
in
this
wicked
world
we
meet
with
other
than
respect
in
answer
to
a
frank
avowal
of
our
determination
to
be
on
the
lord
side
they
were
all
quiet
for
an
instant
and
again
flossy
caught
a
glimpse
of
dennis
face
it
looked
perplexity
and
distrust
was
she
telling
them
a
fairy
story
or
teaching
them
a
new
game
of
whist
then
there
is
such
a
grand
promise
in
this
lesson
flossy
went
on
i
like
it
ever
so
much
for
that
ye
shall
know
the
truth
and
the
truth
shall
make
you
free
free
from
what
asked
abruptly
the
very
question
that
miss
marion
wilbur
had
asked
in
such
anxiety
but
flossy
was
in
a
measure
prepared
for
him
it
chanced
that
she
had
asked
evan
roberts
that
question
why
free
from
the
power
and
dominion
of
satan
not
belonging
to
him
any
more
and
having
a
strength
that
is
beyond
and
above
anything
earthly
to
lean
upon
stronger
than
satan
power
can
ever
be
rich
gave
a
scornful
little
laugh
he
is
an
old
fellow
that
i
do
particularly
believe
in
he
said
loftily
as
though
that
forever
settled
the
question
as
to
the
existence
of
such
a
person
i
think
a
fellow
is
a
silly
coward
who
lays
the
blame
of
his
wickedness
off
on
satan
shoulders
just
as
if
satan
could
make
him
do
what
he
did
choose
to
do
always
supposing
that
there
is
such
a
creature
oh
wise
and
wily
flossy
she
knew
he
was
wrong
she
knew
he
had
contradicted
his
own
logic
used
but
a
few
minutes
before
but
she
did
not
attempt
to
prove
it
to
him
for
in
the
first
place
she
felt
instinctively
that
the
most
difficult
thing
in
the
world
is
to
convince
an
ignorant
person
that
he
has
been
foolish
and
illogical
in
his
argument
you
may
prove
this
to
an
intelligent
mind
that
is
accustomed
to
reason
and
to
weigh
the
merits
of
questions
but
it
is
a
rare
thing
to
find
an
uncultured
brain
that
can
follow
you
closely
enough
to
be
convinced
of
his
own
folly
flossy
did
not
understand
herself
well
enough
to
reason
this
out
it
was
simply
a
fine
instinct
that
she
had
perhaps
it
ought
to
be
called
tact
that
led
her
to
be
careful
how
she
tried
anything
of
this
sort
besides
there
was
another
reason
she
did
not
know
how
to
set
about
doing
it
it
is
one
thing
to
see
a
sophistry
and
another
to
take
to
pieces
the
filmy
threads
of
which
it
is
composed
she
waived
the
whole
subject
and
jumped
to
one
on
which
there
could
be
but
one
opinion
well
then
suppose
you
were
right
and
every
one
were
free
to
be
perfect
if
he
would
that
only
reaches
to
the
end
of
this
life
we
surely
have
been
perfect
you
and
i
for
instance
so
our
perfection
can
not
save
us
from
the
penalty
of
sin
and
that
is
death
what
a
grand
thing
it
would
be
to
be
free
from
that
you
believe
in
death
do
you
and
i
suppose
like
every
other
sensible
person
you
are
afraid
of
death
unless
you
have
found
something
that
makes
you
free
from
its
power
rich
was
still
in
a
scornful
mood
should
like
to
see
anybody
that
is
free
from
that
he
said
sneeringly
as
near
as
i
can
make
out
those
persons
who
think
they
are
good
are
just
as
likely
to
die
as
the
rest
of
us
ah
yes
but
it
is
just
that
little
minute
of
dying
that
you
and
i
are
afraid
of
it
is
we
are
afraid
of
what
will
come
next
you
see
i
know
all
about
it
for
i
was
awfully
afraid
i
had
such
a
fear
as
i
suppose
you
know
nothing
about
when
it
thundered
i
shivered
as
if
i
had
a
chill
and
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
every
flash
of
lightning
was
going
to
kill
me
and
when
i
went
on
a
journey
i
could
enjoy
nothing
for
the
fear
that
there
might
be
an
accident
and
i
might
be
killed
but
i
declare
to
you
that
i
have
found
something
that
has
taken
the
fear
away
i
do
not
mean
that
i
would
like
to
be
killed
or
that
i
am
tired
of
living
or
anything
of
the
sort
i
like
to
live
a
great
deal
better
than
i
ever
did
before
i
think
the
world
is
twice
as
nice
and
everything
a
great
deal
pleasanter
but
when
i
was
coming
home
from
chautauqua
i
would
waken
in
the
night
in
the
and
i
found
to
my
surprise
that
although
i
thought
of
the
same
thing
the
possibility
that
there
might
be
an
accident
that
would
cost
me
my
life
yet
i
felt
that
horrible
sense
of
fear
and
dread
was
utterly
gone
i
could
feel
that
though
death
in
itself
might
be
sad
and
solemn
yet
it
was
after
all
but
the
step
that
opened
the
door
to
joy
in
short
and
here
flossy
face
shone
with
a
rare
sweet
smile
i
that
the
truth
as
it
is
in
jesus
has
made
me
free
rich
was
utterly
silent
what
could
he
reply
in
the
face
of
this
simple
quiet
i
to
say
i
do
believe
it
would
be
the
height
of
folly
and
he
realized
it
as
for
the
rest
they
had
listened
to
this
talk
with
various
degrees
of
interest
the
most
of
them
amused
that
rich
should
be
drawn
into
any
talk
so
serious
and
be
evidently
so
earnest
let
me
tell
you
a
little
about
these
young
men
they
were
not
from
the
very
lowest
depths
of
society
that
is
they
had
homes
and
family
ties
and
they
had
enough
to
eat
and
to
wear
in
fact
they
earned
these
latter
each
for
himself
there
were
two
of
them
who
had
the
advantage
of
the
public
schools
and
were
fair
sort
of
scholars
rich
johnson
was
one
of
these
and
was
therefore
somewhat
looked
up
to
and
respected
by
those
even
who
would
not
have
gone
to
school
another
day
if
they
could
but
they
were
far
enough
out
of
the
reach
of
flossy
shipley
so
far
that
she
had
never
come
in
contact
with
one
of
them
before
in
her
life
she
had
no
idea
as
to
their
names
or
their
homes
or
their
lives
she
had
no
sort
of
idea
of
the
temptations
by
which
they
were
surrounded
nor
what
they
needed
perhaps
this
very
fact
removed
all
touch
of
patronage
from
her
tone
as
when
the
bell
rang
she
found
to
her
great
surprise
that
the
lesson
hour
was
over
she
turned
back
to
them
for
a
moment
and
said
with
that
sparkling
little
smile
of
hers
i
real
sorry
you
had
a
teacher
i
should
have
been
glad
to
have
taught
the
lesson
if
i
had
known
how
but
you
see
how
it
is
i
have
all
these
things
to
learn
now
rich
johnson
rather
prided
himself
on
his
rudeness
a
strange
thing
to
pride
one
self
on
to
be
sure
but
pride
takes
all
sorts
of
curious
forms
and
he
had
actually
rather
gloried
in
his
ability
to
say
rude
and
cutting
things
at
a
moment
notice
words
you
know
that
the
boys
in
his
set
called
but
he
was
at
this
time
actually
surprised
into
being
almost
gallant
we
never
had
a
better
teacher
he
said
quickly
if
you
are
only
just
learning
you
better
try
it
again
on
us
we
like
the
style
enough
sight
better
than
the
finished
up
kind
and
then
flossy
smiled
again
and
thanked
them
and
said
she
had
enjoyed
it
and
then
she
did
an
unprecedented
thing
she
invited
them
all
to
call
on
her
in
a
pretty
graceful
way
precisely
as
she
would
have
invited
a
gentleman
friend
who
had
seen
her
home
from
a
concert
the
quiet
courteous
invitation
to
her
father
house
which
is
a
mere
matter
of
form
among
the
young
ladies
of
her
set
but
which
to
these
boys
was
as
astonishing
as
an
invitation
to
the
garden
of
eden
they
had
not
the
slightest
intention
of
accepting
the
invitation
but
they
felt
without
realizing
what
made
them
feel
so
a
sudden
added
touch
of
i
almost
think
they
were
more
careful
of
their
words
during
the
rest
of
that
day
than
they
would
have
been
but
for
that
invitation
is
splendid
flossy
said
to
ruth
erskine
as
with
her
cheeks
in
a
fine
glow
of
glad
satisfaction
that
she
had
begun
she
joined
ruth
in
the
hall
it
was
very
interesting
said
ruth
in
her
more
quiet
thoughtful
way
she
was
thoughtful
during
the
entire
walk
home
it
was
her
lot
to
slip
into
one
of
those
grand
classes
where
bible
teaching
means
something
more
than
simply
reading
over
the
verses
there
had
been
good
seed
sown
with
a
lavish
hand
and
there
had
been
careful
probing
to
see
if
it
had
taken
root
ruth
had
some
stronger
ideas
about
the
importance
of
continuing
she
had
a
renewed
sense

blessedness
of
being
made
free
she
went
home
with
a
renewed
desire
to
consecrate
herself
and
not
only
to
enjoy
but
to
labor
that
others
might
enter
into

earnest

burdens
under
the
influence
of
the
sermon
and
the
prayers
and
the
glorious
music
life
grew
to
be
to
marion
before
she
reached
home
that
sabbath
evening
she
came
home
with
springing
step
and
with
her
heart
full
of
plans
and
possibilities
for
the
future
not
even
the
dismalness
of
her
unattractive
room
and
desolate
surroundings
had
power
to
drive
the
song
from
her
heart
she
went
about
humming
the
grand
tune
with
which
the
evening
service
had
closed
in
the
cross
of
christ
i
glory
towering
the
wrecks
of
time
as
she
sang
her
whole
soul
thrilled
with
the
joy
of
glorying
in
such
a
theme
and
her
last
thought
as
she
closed
her
eyes
for
the
night
was
about
a
plan
of
work
that
she
meant
to
carry
out
what
could
have
happened
in
the
night
to
so
change
the
face
of
the
world
for
her
it
looked
so
utterly
different
in
the
morning
school
was
to
open
and
she
shrank
from
it
dreaded
it
the
work
looked
all
drudgery
and
the
plans
she
had
formed
the
night
before
seemed
impossibilities
the
face
of
nature
had
changed
wonderfully
in
place
of
radiant
sunshine
there
was
falling
a
steady
dismal
rain
the
clouds
bent
low
and
looked
like
lead
the
wind
was
moaning
in
a
dismal
way
that
felt
like
a
wail
and
nothing
but
umbrellas
and
and
rubber
and
dreariness
were
abroad
the
pretty
summery
school
dress
that
marion
had
laid
out
to
wear
was
hung
sadly
back
in
her
wardrobe
and
the
inevitable
black
alpaca
came
to
the
surface
it
seemed
to
her
the
symbol
of
her
old
life
of
dreariness
which
she
imagined
had
gone
from
her
it
was
not
that
she
felt
utterly
dismal
and
desolate
it
was
not
that
she
had
forgotten
her
late
experiences
it
was
not
that
she
did
not
know
that
she
had
the
friend
who
is
the
same
yesterday
and
forever
it
was
simply
that
she
could
not
feel
it
and
joy
in
it
as
she
had
done
only
yesterday
and
her
religious
life
was
too
recent
not
to
be
swayed
by
feeling
and
impulse
the
fact
that
there
was
a
clear
sun
shining
above
the
clouds
and
a
strong
and
firm
mountain
up
in
the
sunshine
on
which
it
was
her
privilege
to
stand
despite
what
was
going
on
below
she
did
not
understand
she
did
not
know
what
effect
the
weather
and
the
sense
of
fatigue
were
having
on
her
and
she
felt
not
only
mortified
but
alarmed
that
her
joy
had
so
soon
gone
out
in
cloud
and
gloom
if
she
could
only
just
run
around
the
corner
to
see
eurie
a
minute
or
up
the
hill
to
flossy
home
how
much
it
would
help
her
and
the
thought
that
she
was
actually
looking
to
flossy
shipley
and
eurie
mitchell
for
help
of
any
sort
brought
the
first
smile
that
she
had
indulged
in
that
morning
she
was
certainly
changed
when
she
could
look
to
them
for
comfort
or
sympathy
is
there
anyone
reading
this
account
of
an
every
day
life
who
does
not
understand
by
past
experience
just
how
trying
a
first
day
at
school
is
when
teachers
and
scholars
have
come
out
from
the
influence
of
a
long
summer
vacation
next
week
or
even
they
will
have
battled
with
and
in
a
measure
choked
the
spirit
of
disgust
or
homesickness
or
weariness
with
which
they
come
back
from
play
to
work
but
nothing
seems
quite
so
hard
in
all
the
world
as
to
turn
from
the
hundred
things
that
have
interested
and
delighted
them
and
settle
down
to
grammar
and
philosophy
and
algebra
teachers
and
scholars
alike
are
apt
to
feel
the
depression
of
such
circumstances
and
when
you
add
to
the
other
discomforts
that
of
a
steady
pouring
rain
with
a
sound
of
fall
in
every
whiff
of
wind
you
will
understand
that
marion
was
to
have
comparatively
little
help
from
outside
influences
she
felt
the
gloom
in
her
heart
deepen
as
the
day
went
on
she
was
astonished
and
mortified
at
herself
to
find
that
the
old
feelings
of
irritability
and
sharpness
still
held
her
in
grasp
she
was
not
free
from
at
least
her
tongue
was
as
strongly
tempted
to
be
sarcastic
and
her
tone
to
be
stern
as
ever
they
had
been
none
of
the
scholars
helped
her
those
of
them
who
were
neither
gloomy
nor
listless
nor
inclined
to
be
cross
were
simply
they
laughed
on
every
possible
occasion
with
or
without
an
excuse
they
devised
ways
and
means
to
draw
off
the
attention
of
these
who
made
faint
efforts
to
be
studious
and
in
short
were
decidedly
the
most
provoking
of
all
the
elements
of
the
day
marion
found
herself
more
than
once
curling
her
lip
in
the
old
sarcastic
way
at
the
inconsistencies
and
improprieties
of
those
among
her
pupils
who
bore
the
name
of
christian
during
the
long
recess
she
tried
to
go
away
by
herself
in
the
hope
that
her
heart
might
quiet
down
and
rest
itself
on
some
of
the
new
and
solid
ground
on
which
she
had
so
lately
learned
to
tread
but
they
followed
her
several
of
the
teachers
in
a
gayety
of
mood
that
was
half
affected
to
hide
the
homesickness
of
their
hearts
and
therefore
infected
no
one
else
with
a
cheerful
spirit
they
were
armed
with
a
package
of
examination
papers
given
in
by
those
scholars
who
aspired
to
a
higher
grade
they
loudly
called
on
marion
for
assistance
you
have
had
a
single
examination
class
yet
then
it
is
clearly
your
duty
to
help
the
afflicted
ye
one
another
burdens
you
know
it
was
miss
banks
who
said
this
and
she
had
barely
escaped
being
marion
intimate
friend
as
it
was
she
came
nearer
being
familiar
with
her
than
with
any
other
she
wondered
now
how
it
could
have
been
that
she
had
liked
her
her
voice
sounded
so
shrill
and
unwinning
and
the
quotation
that
she
so
glibly
uttered
was
such
a
jar
however
she
turned
back
with
a
wan
attempt
at
a
smile
and
said
i
shall
have
enough
examination
papers
of
my
own
before
night
how
do
yours
range
and
she
took
half
a
dozen
that
were
reached
out
to
her
they
range
precisely
as
if
we
had
a
parcel
of
idiots
in
our
care
the
blunders
that
these
aspiring
young
ladies
and
gentlemen
make
in
orthography
are
enough
to
set
one
teeth
on
edge
orthography
said
marion
with
a
curling
lip
they
are
years
too
old
for
any
such
as
that
it
must
be
history
at
least
here
is
allie
march
struggling
for
the
advanced
history
class
and
i
venture
to
say
she
does
know
who
was
president
four
years
ago
and
then
marion
suddenly
remembered
that
allie
march
was
the
one
whom
in
her
glorified
moments
of
only
the
day
before
she
had
aspired
to
help
forward
in
her
christian
life
if
she
had
seen
that
sneer
and
heard
those
sharp
words
would
it
have
helped
her
or
inclined
her
ever
to
look
that
way
for
help
then
marion
and
the
rest
gave
themselves
to
silence
and
to
work
what
is
the
prospect
for
promotion
easton
said
as
he
came
and
leaned
over
the
desk
before
which
they
worked
miss
banks
looked
up
with
a
laugh
it
reminds
one
of
one
childhood
and
scripture
learning
days
are
called
but
few
are
chosen
there
will
be
exceedingly
few
chosen
from
this
class
why
did
those
bible
quotations
so
jar
marion
it
had
been
one
of
her
weak
points
to
quote
them
aptly
and
with
stinging
sarcasm
perhaps
that
was
one
reason
why
she
so
keenly
felt
their
impropriety
now
she
had
been
so
long
among
the
called
and
so
very
recently
among
the
chosen
the
possibility
of
having
spent
a
lifetime
without
ever
becoming
one
of
those
chosen
ones
seemed
so
fearful
to
her
and
she
felt
that
she
had
so
narrowly
escaped
that
end
that
she
shivered
and
drew
her
little
shawl
around
her
as
she
glanced
up
quickly
at
easton
he
was
a
christian
man
a
member
of
the
first
church
would
he
have
any
reply
to
make
to
this
irreverent
application
of
solemn
truth
no
he
had
only
a
laugh
for
reply
it
might
have
been
at
miss
banks
rueful
face
that
he
laughed
but
marion
would
have
liked
him
better
if
he
had
looked
miss
banks
at
that
moment
caught
a
glimpse
of
marion
grave
face
miss
wilbur
she
said
quickly
what
on
earth
can
have
happened
to
you
during
vacation
i
never
in
my
life
saw
you
look
so
solemn
did
i
hear
something
about
your
going
to
the
woods
to
how
was
that
i
verily
believe
you
spent
your
time
on
the
and
have
caught
the
expression
did
you
find
anyone
to
say
to
you
unto
me
i
sure
you
hard
enough
and
look
laden
she
easton
i
really
think
we
shall
have
to
start
a
over
her
marion
threw
down
the
paper
she
was
correcting
with
a
nervous
start
and
her
voice
sounded
sharper
than
she
meant
how
is
it
possible
miss
banks
that
you
can
repeat
those
words
in
such
a
shockingly
irreverent
way
surely
you
profess
to
have
at
least
a
respect
for
the
one
who
first
uttered
them
really
said
miss
banks
with
an
embarrassed
laugh
astonishment
and
confusion
struggling
for
the
mastery
on
her
flushed
face
saul
also
among
the
prophets
there
i
declare
i
am
quoting
again
is
that
wicked
too
easton
how
is
that
miss
wilbur
has
been
to
and
is
not
responsible
for
her
words
but
you
ought
to
be
good
authority
is
it
wicked
for
me
to
quote
scripture
have
i
as
good
a
right
to
bible
verses
as
any
of
you
here
has
miss
wilbur
been
giving
us
lessons
in
that
art
for
the
last
two
years
and
she
suddenly
deserts
and
takes
to
preaching
at
us
is
that
fair
now
if
it
were
not
wicked
i
might
say
to
her
heal
thyself
marion
bestowed
a
quick
searching
almost
pleading
glance
on
easton
and
then
looked
down
with
a
flushed
and
disappointed
face
he
was
not
equal
to
a
bold
spreading
of
his
professed
colors
he
laughed
not
easily
or
as
if
he
enjoyed
the
sharp
words
veiled
so
thinly
by
pleasantry
but
as
if
he
were
in
an
awkward
position
and
did
not
see
his
way
out
you
were
just
a
little
hard
on
miss
wilbur
in
your
selections
you
must
remember
he
said
at
last
people
can
always
be
excused
for
more
or
less
sombreness
on
the
first
day
of
the
term
and
then
he
went
away
hurriedly
as
if
he
desired
to
avoid
anything
further
in
that
strain
hard
on
miss
wilbur
did
he
suppose
she
cared
for
such
vapid
nonsense
what
surprised
and
hurt
her
was
that
he
so
utterly
ignored
the
question
at
issue
did
he
a
professed
christian
of
many
years
standing
see
no
impropriety
in
this
manner
of
quoting
the
very
words
of
the
lord
himself
or
had
he
sufficient
moral
courage
to
rebuke
it
either
conclusion
was
distasteful
especially
distasteful
to
her
marion
found
because
the
one
in
question
was
easton
hitherto
she
had
held
him
a
little
above
the
ordinary
was
he
then
so
common
after
all
this
little
occurrence
did
not
serve
to
sweeten
her
day
the
more
so
that
after
she
had
quieted
down
a
little
at
noon
she
tried
to
join
the
other
teachers
as
usual
and
felt
an
air
of
stiffness
or
embarrassment
or
unnaturalness
of
some
sort
in
their
manner
to
her
twice
as
she
came
toward
them
miss
banks
who
was
talking
volubly
hushed
into
sudden
and
utter
silence
after
that
marion
went
into
the
upper
hall
and
ate
her
lunch
by
herself
matters
grew
worse
rather
than
better
as
the
afternoon
session
dragged
its
slow
hours
along
the
air
of
the
seemed
close
and
unbearable
and
the
moment
a
window
was
raised
the
driving
rain
rushed
in
and
tormented
the
victim
who
sat
nearest
to
it
poor
marion
who
was
as
susceptible
to
the
temperature
of
rooms
as
a
thermometer
tried
each
window
in
succession
during
the
afternoon
and
came
to
the
desperate
conclusion
that
the
rain
came
from
all
quarters
of
the
leaden
sky
at
once
the
spirit
of
unrest
that
pervaded
the
room
grew
into
positive
lawlessness
as
the
day
waned
and
marion
tone
had
taken
even
unusual
sharpness
her
was
giving
way
instead
of
helping
she
had
been
positively
an
injury
to
allie
march
first
by
the
sharpness
of
her
reprimands
and
then
by
sarcastic
comments
on
her
extreme
dullness
but
the
girl
who
had
tried
her
the
most
during
the
entire
day
was
the
most
brilliant
and
as
a
rule
the
most
studious
scholar
in
her
room
every
teacher
knows
that
the
good
scholar
who
occasionally
makes
a
failure
is
the
one
who
exasperates
the
most
you
are
so
utterly
unprepared
for
anything
but
perfection
on
that
one
part
not
that
gracie
dennis
was
perfect
she
was
by
far
too
noisy
and
decided
for
that
but
she
was
as
a
rule
in
her
manners
and
words
showing
her
careful
teaching
and
her
own
sense
of
there
had
been
little
sympathy
however
between
marion
and
herself
she
was
too
much
like
marion
in
a
haughty
independence
of
manner
to
ever
become
that
lady
favorite
why
as
to
that
i
am
not
sure
that
she
a
favorite
there
were
many
who
liked
her
and
all
respected
her
but
no
one
thought
of
expressing
outright
affection
for
miss
wilbur
as
for
grace
dennis
she
had
come
nearer
to
outwitting
her
teacher
than
had
any
other
young
lady
in
the
room
and
she
stood
less
in
awe
of
her
on
this
particular
day
the
spirit
of
disquiet
seemed
to
have
gotten
entire
possession
of
the
girl
she
had
not
given
fifteen
minutes
to
downright
work
but
had
dawdled
and
lounged
in
a
most
exasperating
manner
and
at
times
exhibited
a
dullness
that
was
very
hard
to
bear
patiently
because
marion
felt
so
certain
that
it
was
either
feigned
or
the
result
of
willful
inattention
several
times
had
marion
to
speak
decidedly
to
the
young
ladies
in
her
seat
once
or
twice
directly
to
grace
herself
and
at
last
losing
all
patience
with
her
she
took
decided
measures
miss
dennis
i
really
have
something
to
do
besides
watch
you
all
the
time
if
you
please
you
may
bring
your
book
to
the
desk
and
take
the
seat
beside
me
then
if
you
whisper
i
can
afford
you
a
special
audience
what
an
unheard
of
thing
grace
dennis
actually
called
to
the
platform
to
the
post
of
disgrace
the
leading
young
lady
in
the
school
and
rev
dennis
only
daughter
some
of
the
scholars
looked
aghast
some
of
the
class
who
had
long
envied
her
were
rude
and
cruel
enough
to
indulge
in
an
audible
giggle
as
for
grace
herself
hardly
any
one
could
have
been
more
amazed
it
was
many
a
day
since
with
all
her
love
of
fun
and
her
dangerous
position
as
a
leader
she
had
been
obliged
to
receive
a
public
reprimand
she
had
never
in
her
life
been
called
to
that
public
seat
which
was
but
one
remove
from
being
sent
to
easton
private
office
her
great
handsome
eyes
dilated
and
flashed
and
her
cheeks
glowed
like
fire
she
half
arose
then
sat
down
again
and
the
school
waited
breathlessly
being
about
equally
divided
as
to
whether
she
would
obey
or
rebel
marion
herself
was
somewhat
in
doubt
and
in
her
excitement
over
the
unwonted
scene
concluded
to
make
obedience
a
necessity
on
the
second
thought
you
may
have
your
choice
miss
dennis
you
may
come
to
the
desk
or
repair
at
once
to
easton
room
and
state
the
cause
of
your
appearance
again
the
hateful
giggle
there
were
those
who
knew
why
being
sent
to
easton
was
the
worst
thing
that
gracie
dennis
thought
could
happen
to
her
she
arose
again
and
now
she
had
the
advantage
of
her
teacher
for
there
were
dignity
and
composure
in
her
voice
as
she
said
i
believe
i
have
never
disobeyed
your
orders
miss
wilbur
i
certainly
do
not
propose
to
do
so
now
then
she
came
with
composed
step
and
took
her
seat
beside
marion
but
her
eyes
still
glittered
and
as
the
business
of
the
hour
went
on
more
quietly
than
any
hour
that
had
preceded
it
marion
as
she
caught
glimpses
now
and
then
of
the
face
bent
over
her
latin
grammar
saw
that
it
was
flushed
almost
to
a
purple
hue
and
that
the
intense
look
in
those
handsome
eyes
did
not
quiet
she
had
roused
a
dangerous
spirit
to
add
to
the
embarrassment
and
the
keenness
of
her
rebuke
the
door
leading
from
the
recitation
room
behind
the
platform
suddenly
opened
and
easton
himself
came
around
to
speak
to
marion
he
paused
in
astonishment
as
he
caught
sight
of
the
culprit
beside
her
and
for
an
instant
was
visibly
embarrassed
then
he
rallied
and
bowing
slightly
and
very
gravely
passed
her
by
and
addressed
marion
in
a
low
voice
as
for
gracie
she
did
not
once
lift
her
eyes
after
the
first
swift
glance
had
assured
her
who
the
caller
was
i
have
made
an
enemy
thought
marion
to
herself
as
her
own
excitement
beginning
to
subside
she
had
time
to
reflect
on
whether
she
had
done
wisely
she
will
never
forgive
me
this
public
insult
as
she
will
choose
to
call
it
i
see
it
in
her
handsome
dangerous
eyes
and
yet
i
can
hardly
see
how
i
could
have
done
otherwise
if
almost
any
of
the
others
had
given
me
half
the
provocation
that
she
has
i
should
have
sent
them
to
easton
without
question
why
should
i
hesitate
in
her
favor
oh
me
what
a
miserable
day
it
has
been
and
i
meant
it
to
be
such
a
good
one
i
wonder
if
my
christian
life
must
be
marked
by
such
weary
and
ignominious
failures
as
this
gracie
dennis
is
one
of
the
young
ladies
a
lovely
christian
she
has
shown
and
if
i
am
not
mistaken
will
continue
to
show
to
me
i
wonder
if
it
amounts
to
nothing
but
a
name
after
all
with
the
most
of
them
and
here
marion
stopped
this
train
of
thought
because
she
suddenly
remembered
that
she
was
now
numbered
among
those
on
whom
others
were
looking
and
wondering
if
their
religion
meant
anything
but
name
suppose
that
some
had
been
looking
at
her
in
that
light
this
day
how
would
they
have
decided
she
found
that
she
was
not
willing
to
be
judged
by
the
same
rule
that
she
was
almost
unconsciously
applying
to
gracie
dennis
then
she
went
back
over
the
day
and
tried
to
discover
wherein
she
had
failed
and
how
she
might
have
done
what
would
have
been
better
could
she
not
after
all
have
gotten
along
without
so
severe
and
public
a
rebuke
to
this
young
girl
at
her
side
she
knew
her
temperament
well
indeed
it
was
she
confessed
it
to
herself
a
good
deal
like
her
own
what
would
be
a
trifle
to
half
the
girls
in
the
school
what
would
be
forgotten
by
the
best
of
them
in
a
day
or
two
would
burn
in
this
girl
memory
and
affect
her
after
life
and
manner
almost
in
spite
of
herself
the
more
so
because
of
that
unfortunate
call
from
easton
marion
knew
by
the
swift
glance
which
he
gave
at
this
strange
situation
that
it
meant
something
to
him
then
it
was
doubly
hard
for
gracie
she
began
to
feel
sorry
for
her
to
wish
that
she
might
in
some
way
smooth
over
the
chasm
that
she
had
builded
between
them
she
is
very
young
she
said
to
herself
with
a
little
sigh
i
ought
not
to
have
expected
such
wonderful
things
of
her
i
wish
i
had
managed
differently
it
is
too
late
now
i
wonder
how
i
shall
get
out
of
it
all
shall
i
just
let
her
go
home
without
saying
anything
all
these
troubled
thoughts
wandered
through
marion
brain
during
the
intervals
of
quiet
when
nothing
was
heard
save
the
scratch
of
pens
for
the
entire
room
was
engaged
in
a
dictation
exercise
which
was
to
determine
their
standing
in
the
writing
class
at
last
there
was
quiet
the
demon
of
inattention
had
seemingly
been
exorcised
or
subdued
for
all
were
industriously
at
work
and
marion
had
a
chance
to
rest
from
the
alert
watchfulness
which
had
characterized
the
day
all
at
work
but
gracie
she
still
bent
over
her
latin
grammar
she
had
not
asked
permission
to
join
the
dictation
class
and
marion
had
not
volunteered
it
truth
to
tell
she
hardly
dared
venture
to
address
her
at
all
the
eyes
had
lost
none
of
their
keen
flash
and
the
color
seemed
to
be
deepening
instead
of
subsiding
on
her
pretty
soft
cheeks
marion
as
her
eyes
roved
over
the
exercise
book
in
her
hand
felt
her
heart
arrested
by
these
words
among
the
selections
for
dictation
bear
ye
one
another
burdens
and
so
fulfill
the
law
of
christ
they
smote
her
like
a
blow
from
an
unseen
hand
what
burdens
of
homesickness
and
and
weariness
might
not
all
these
girls
have
had
to
bear
had
she
helped
them
had
her
manner
been
winning
and
hopeful
and
invigorating
had
her
words
been
gentle
and
well
chosen
as
well
as
firm
and
decisive
her
answers
to
these
questions
stung
her
moved
by
a
sudden
impulse
and
not
giving
herself
time
to
shrink
from
the
determination
she
bent
forward
a
little
and
addressed
gracie
read
that
gracie
i
have
not
obeyed
its
direction
have
you
do
you
think
you
have
helped
me
to
bear
burdens
would
gracie
answer
her
at
all
would
her
answer
be
cold
and
haughty
as
nearly
rude
as
she
had
dared
to
make
it
marion
felt
her
heart
throb
while
she
waited
and
she
to
wait
for
gracie
was
utterly
silent
at
last
her
teacher
stole
a
glance
at
her
the
great
beautiful
eyes
were
lifted
to
her
face
the
flash
was
passing
out
of
them
in
its
place
there
was
a
puzzled
wondering
questioning
look
and
when
at
last
she
spoke
her
voice
was
timid
as
if
she
were
half
frightened
at
her
own
words
and
yet
eager
as
one
who
must
know
miss
wilbur
you
do
mean
oh
you
mean
that
want
to
fulfill
the
law
of
christ
that
you
own
him
that
i
own
him
and
love
him
marion
said
her
cheeks
glowing
now
as
gracie
did
and
that
i
want
above
all
things
to
fulfill
his
law
and
yet
that
i
have
miserably
failed
even
this
first
day
among
marion
sad
thoughts
that
day
had
been
there
is
no
one
to
know
or
to
care
whether
i
am
different
or
not
if
i
could
only
some
one
some
christian
who
would
be
glad
but
who
is
there
to
tell
easton
is
a
christian
but
he
does
care
enough
about
the
lord
jesus
to
rebuke
those
who
profane
his
name
he
has
let
me
do
it
in
his
presence
and
smiled
at
my
wit
and
these
girls
and
here
marion
lip
had
curled
they
do
know
what
they
mean
by
their
professions
she
was
unprepared
for
what
followed
gracie
dennis
graceful
queenly
in
her
dignity
and
haughty
even
in
her
mirth
said
suddenly
in
a
voice
which
quivered
with
gladness
oh
i
am
so
glad
glad
oh
miss
wilbur
i
do
know
how
to
be
thankful
enough
and
then
she
raised
her
head
suddenly
and
her
glowing
lips
just
touched
marion
cheek
it
was
so
unusual
for
marion
to
be
kissed
her
friends
at
chautauqua
had
been
those
who
rarely
indulged
in
that
sort
of
caress
never
at
least
with
her
and
while
as
i
told
you
many
of
them
liked
and
all
of
them
respected
her
it
was
yet
an
unheard
of
thing
for
the
scholars
to
caress
miss
wilbur
and
then
too
gracie
dennis
was
by
no
means
lavish
of
her
kisses
this
made
the
token
seem
so
much
more
it
felt
almost
like
a
benediction
gracie
next
words
were
humbling
to
her
miss
wilbur
will
you
forgive
me
i
did
mean
to
annoy
you
i
know
what
has
been
the
matter
with
me
but
long
before
this
the
last
laggard
had
finished
her
line
and
was
staring
in
undisguised
astonishment
at
the
scene
enacted
on
the
platform
marion
rallied
her
excited
thoughts
dear
child
she
said
we
have
each
something
to
forgive
i
think
i
have
been
too
severe
with
you
we
will
try
to
help
each
other
then
she
gave
the
next
sentence
as
calmly
as
usual
but
she
went
home
that
night
through
the
rain
with
a
quick
step
and
with
joy
in
her
heart
it
was
not
profession
it
meant
something
to
those
girls
to
grace
dennis
it
meant
everything
it
was
enough
to
make
her
forget
her
passion
and
her
wounded
pride
and
to
make
her
face
actually
radiant
with
joy
it
should
mean
more
to
she
had
failed
that
day
she
had
not
been
in
any
sense
what
she
meant
to
be
what
she
ought
to
have
been
but
there
was
a
blessed
verse
who
forgiveth
thine
iniquities
what
a
salvation
able
to
forgive
transgression
to
cover
sin
to
remember
it
no
more
it
all
seemed
very
natural
to
her
very
like
an
infinite
saviour
one
infinitely
loving
she
began
to
realize
that
even
poor
love
could
cover
a
multitude
of
sins
how
easy
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
would
be
to
overlook
the
mistakes
and
shortcomings
of
gracie
dennis
after
this

chapter
iv
baker
sabbath
evening
among
marion
wilbur
gloomy
thoughts
during
that
trying
monday
were
these
some
lives
are
a
good
deal
harder
to
bear
than
others
it
would
be
nonsense
for
some
people
to
talk
about
crosses
there
are
ruth
and
flossy
what
do
they
know
about
annoyances
or
such
homes
as
theirs
and
such
occupations
as
theirs
have
very
little
in
common
with
hard
uncongenial
work
such
as
mine
eurie
mitchell
has
less
easy
times
but
then
it
is
home
and
father
and
mother
and
family
friends
she
is
all
alone
none
of
them
can
sympathize
with
me
i
do
see
how
flossy
shipley
is
ever
to
grow
if
are
a
fruitful
condition
of
the
christian
life
i
sure
she
can
do
as
she
pleases
and
when
she
pleases
thus
much
marion
knew
about
other
lives
than
hers
the
actual
truth
was
that
flossy
shadows
began
on
sabbath
evening
while
marion
was
yet
on
the
heights
it
was
just
as
they
stepped
from
the
aisle
of
the
church
into
the
wide
hall
that
baker
joined
her
this
was
not
a
new
experience
he
was
very
apt
to
join
her
no
other
gentleman
had
been
a
more
frequent
or
more
enjoyable
guest
at
her
father
house
indeed
he
was
so
familiar
that
he
was
as
likely
to
come
on
the
sabbath
as
on
any
other
day
and
was
often
in
the
habit
of
calling
to
accompany
flossy
to
any
evening
service
where
there
was
to
be
a
little
grander
style
of
music
than
usual
or
a
special
floral
display
in
fact
he
had
called
this
very
evening
on
such
an
errand
but
it
was
after
flossy
had
gone
to
her
own
church
so
her
first
meeting
with
him
since
chautauqua
experiences
was
in
that
hall
belonging
to
the
first
church
he
said
joining
her
without
the
formality
of
a
question
as
to
whether
it
would
be
agreeable
his
friendship
was
on
too
assured
a
footing
for
the
need
of
that
formality
you
are
more
than
usually
devoted
to
the
first
church
are
you
not
i
saw
you
in
the
family
pew
this
morning
i
felt
certain
of
being
in
time
to
take
you
to
the
south
side
stephen
church
has
a
grand
choral
service
this
evening
i
was
in
at
one
of
the
rehearsals
and
it
promised
to
be
an
unusually
fine
thing
i
am
disappointed
that
you
did
not
hear
it
here
began
flossy
unhappiness
neither
marion
nor
ruth
could
have
appreciated
it
to
either
of
those
it
would
have
been
an
actual
satisfaction
to
have
said
to
baker
in
a
calm
and
superior
tone
of
voice
thanks
for
your
kindness
but
i
have
decided
to
attend
my
own
church
service
regularly
after
this
and
would
therefore
not
have
been
able
to
accompany
you
if
i
had
been
at
home
but
for
flossy
such
an
explanation
was
simply
dreadful
it
was
so
natural
and
would
have
been
easy
to
have
murmured
a
word
of
regret
at
her
absence
and
expressed
disappointment
in
having
missed
the
choral
but
for
that
address
to
the
children
given
under
the
trees
at
chautauqua
by
hurlbut
she
would
have
said
these
smooth
words
as
sweetly
as
usual
without
a
thought
of
conscience
but
had
not
he
shown
her
as
plainly
as
though
he
had
looked
down
into
her
heart
and
seen
it
there
that
these
pleasant
courteous
phrases
which
are
so
winning
and
so
false
were
among
her
besetting
sins
had
he
not
put
her
forever
on
her
guard
concerning
them
had
she
not
promised
to
wage
solemn
war
against
the
tendency
to
so
sin
with
her
graceful
tongue
yet
how
she
dreaded
the
plain
speaking
how
would
marion
lips
have
curled
over
the
idea
of
such
a
small
matter
as
that
being
a
cross
and
yet
flossy
could
have
been
sweet
and
patient
and
tender
to
the
listless
homesick
and
kissed
away
half
their
gloom
and
thought
it
no
cross
at
all
verily
there
is
a
difference
in
these
crosses
and
verily
every
heart
knoweth
its
own
bitterness
baker
was
loth
to
leave
the
subject
are
you
being
unusually
devout
he
asked
i
heard
of
you
at
i
was
certain
after
that
effort
i
should
find
you
at
home
resting
what
spell
came
over
you
to
give
the
first
church
so
much
of
your
time
one
would
think
to
hear
you
that
i
never
went
to
church
on
sabbath
evening
flossy
said
and
then
to
a
certain
degree
conscience
triumphed
i
have
not
been
very
often
it
is
true
but
i
intend
to
reform
in
that
respect
in
the
future
i
mean
to
go
whenever
i
can
and
i
mean
to
go
always
to
the
first
church
baker
looked
at
her
curiously
in
the
moonlight
is
that
an
outgrowth
of
your
experience
in
the
woods
he
asked
yes
flossy
said
simply
and
bravely
he
longed
to
question
further
to
quiz
her
a
little
but
something
in
the
tone
of
the
monosyllable
prevented
so
he
said
i
am
at
least
surprised
at
part
of
the
decision
i
thought
part
of
the
work
of
those
gatherings
was
to
teach
fellowship
and
unity
why
should
you
desert
other
churches
there
is
no
desertion
about
it
i
do
not
belong
to
other
churches
and
nobody
has
reason
to
expect
me
at
any
of
them
but
my
pastor
has
a
right
to
expect
me
to
be
in
my
pew
oh
then
it
is
the
accident
of
the
first
choice
that
must
determine
one
sitting
in
church
for
all
future
time
with
me
it
has
been
only
an
accident
she
said
simply
i
suppose
there
are
people
who
had
better
reasons
for
selecting
their
church
home
but
i
am
very
well
satisfied
with
my
place
and
then
flossy
was
very
glad
that
they
were
nearing
her
father
house
the
gladness
did
not
last
however
there
hung
over
it
another
cross
this
baker
had
been
in
the
habit
of
being
invited
to
enter
and
of
spending
an
hour
or
more
in
cosy
chat
with
the
family
nothing
confidential
or
special
in
these
sabbath
evening
calls
they
seemed
simply
to
serve
to
pass
away
a
dull
hour
they
had
been
pleasant
to
flossy
but
it
so
happened
that
the
hours
of
the
sabbath
had
grown
precious
to
her
none
of
them
were
dull
every
moment
of
them
was
needed
besides
in
their
walk
up
the
hill
from
the
auditorium
one
evening
evan
roberts
had
said
in
answer
to
a
wonderment
from
her
that
so
little
was
accomplished
by
the
sabbath
services
throughout
the
land
i
think
one
reason
is
the
habit
that
so
many
people
have
of
frittering
a
way
any
serious
impression
or
solemn
thought
they
may
have
had
by
a
stream
of
small
talk
in
which
they
indulge
with
their
own
family
or
their
intimate
friends
after
what
they
call
the
sabbath
is
past
do
you
know
there
are
hundreds
of
people
good
in
fact
christians
who
seem
to
think
that
the
old
puritan
rules
in
regard
to
hours
hold
yet
in
part
it
begins
at
eight
or
nine
when
they
have
their
nap
out
and
at
the
very
latest
it
closes
with
the
benediction
after
the
second
service
and
they
laugh
and
talk
on
the
way
home
and
at
home
as
if
the
restraints
of
the
day
were
over
at
last
how
precisely
he
had
described
the
sabbath
day
of
the
shipley
family
with
what
a
sense
of
relief
had
she
often
sat
and
chatted
with
baker
at
the
close
of
what
had
been
to
her
an
irksome
day
and
felt
that
at
last
the
sense
of
propriety
would
not
be
shocked
if
they
laughed
and
bantered
each
other
as
usual
things
were
different
now
but
poor
flossy
face
flushed
and
her
heart
beat
hard
over
the
trial
of
asking
baker
to
come
in
silly
child
ruth
would
have
said
and
her
calm
clear
voice
would
not
have
hesitated
over
the
words
baker
i
can
not
ask
you
in
this
evening
because
i
have
determined
to
receive
no
more
calls
even
from
intimate
friends
on
the
sabbath
on
any
other
evening
i
shall
be
happy
to
see
you
as
for
marion
she
would
have
decidedly
enjoyed
saying
it
but
flossy
she
could
never
have
explained
it
to
him
her
voice
would
have
trembled
too
much
and
her
heart
beat
too
hard
the
very
most
that
she
could
do
was
to
keep
her
lips
closed
no
invitation
from
her
should
pass
them
and
this
in
itself
was
five
times
more
of
a
cross
than
it
would
have
been
for
either
of
the
others
to
have
spoken
however
it
did
no
good
baker
friendship
was
on
too
assured
a
footing
to
wait
for
ceremony
he
had
received
too
many
invitations
of
that
nature
to
even
notice
the
omission
now
though
flossy
paused
and
turned
toward
him
he
did
not
notice
it
but
himself
opened
the
door
for
her
and
passed
in
at
her
side
talking
still
about
some
matter
connected
with
his
plans
for
the
evening
that
had
been
overthrown
by
her
strange
propensity
for
church
she
did
not
hear
him
at
all
she
was
both
grieved
and
annoyed
if
only
she
dared
go
directly
to
her
room
if
she
had
been
ruth
erskine
it
would
have
been
done
in
a
moment
they
sat
down
in
the
back
parlor
and
it
was
made
evident
to
flossy
that
the
entertainment
of
baker
would
be
considered
her
special
duty
the
library
door
was
closed
and
the
sound
of
subdued
voices
there
told
that
kitty
shipley
and
her
suitor
were
having
a
confidential
talk
kitty
would
help
then
shipley
had
retired
and
shipley
sat
at
the
drop
light
reading
the
journal
he
glanced
up
at
their
entrance
gave
baker
the
courteous
and
yet
familiar
greeting
that
welcomed
him
as
a
special
friend
of
the
house
and
then
went
on
with
his
reading
as
for
her
brother
charlie
he
had
not
come
in
and
probably
would
not
for
hours
to
come
what
was
there
for
flossy
to
do
but
to
take
a
seat
and
talk
to
baker
yet
how
she
shrank
from
it
she
wanted
to
be
alone
to
go
over
in
her
heart
all
the
sweet
and
blessed
experiences
of
the
day
for
this
day
had
helped
her
much
she
wanted
to
think
about
those
boys
in
the
school
and
form
plans
for
their
future
and
try
to
decide
whether
it
could
be
that
they
would
really
like
her
for
a
teacher
and
whether
dennis
would
let
her
undertake
the
class
why
would
not
baker
go
home
what
is
the
matter
with
you
he
asked
studying
her
face
curiously
and
with
a
doubtful
sound
in
his
voice
i
do
believe
that
strange
freak
of
yours
did
you
any
good
it
did
me
more
good
than
anything
that
ever
happened
to
me
in
my
life
flossy
said
positively
if
she
could
only
have
explained
to
him
just
what
the
nature
of
that
good
was
possibly
she
might
have
tried
only
there
sat
her
father
who
could
tell
when
his
interest
in
the
would
cease
and
he
give
attention
to
her
flossy
could
not
understand
why
she
should
be
so
afraid
of
her
father
in
this
matter
but
she
was
very
much
afraid
the
talk
they
had
was
of
that
kind
known
as
small
to
flossy
it
seemed
exceedingly
small
and
she
did
not
know
how
to
make
it
otherwise
she
began
to
wonder
if
she
and
baker
really
had
any
ideas
in
common
yet
baker
could
talk
with
gentlemen
and
talk
well
it
was
simply
the
habit
of
being
frippery
with
the
ladies
that
made
his
words
seem
so
foolish
to
flossy
contrary
to
her
expectation
her
brother
charlie
suddenly
appeared
on
the
scene
and
for
a
time
she
was
privileged
to
slip
into
the
background
charlie
had
been
to
hear
the
choral
and
baker
was
very
anxious
to
know
as
to
its
success
you
would
have
supposed
them
to
be
talking
about
a
prima
donna
concert
at
last
charlie
turned
to
flossy
with
the
trying
question
sis
why
did
you
go
to
the
choral
i
thought
you
were
coming
for
her
baker
did
you
tell
me
so
i
came
but
was
too
late
miss
flossy
had
already
betaken
herself
to
the
first
church
so
missed
the
choral
well
only
part
of
it
i
went
for
an
hour
then
i
left
and
went
in
search
of
your
sister
to
discover
if
i
could
what
special
attractions
first
church
had
for
her
now
this
fashion
of
going
to
one
service
until
he
was
tired
and
then
quietly
slipping
out
in
search
of
something
more
attractive
was
peculiar
to
baker
flossy
had
known
of
his
doing
it
on
several
different
occasions
the
very
most
that
she
had
thought
about
it
had
been
that
it
was
making
one
self
very
conspicuous
she
did
believe
she
would
like
to
do
it
even
if
she
were
a
man
but
the
action
had
taken
an
irreverent
shade
that
it
never
had
before
she
discovered
that
she
utterly
disapproved
of
it
there
seemed
to
be
many
things
in
baker
that
met
with
her
disapproval
meantime
the
talk
went
on
did
you
find
the
attraction
charlie
asked
baker
shrugged
his
handsome
shoulders
i
confess
i
could
find
it
in
the
sermon
it
was
one
of
the
sharpest
and
bluest
efforts
that
poor
man
has
the
dyspepsia
i
feel
certain
seems
to
me
he
develops
an
increased
ability
for
making
people
miserable
now
baker
fully
expected
to
draw
forth
by
this
remark
one
of
flossy
silvery
laughs
which
to
tell
the
truth
were
becoming
sweeter
to
his
ears
than
any
choral
he
was
surprised
and
annoyed
at
the
steady
look
of
thoughtful
not
to
say
distressed
gravity
that
she
gave
him
out
of
those
soft
blue
eyes
of
hers
he
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
this
flossy
he
was
feeling
the
change
in
her
more
decidedly
than
anyone
else
had
done
he
waited
for
flossy
answer
and
she
gave
it
at
last
in
a
grave
rebuking
tone
of
voice
i
liked
the
sermon
very
much
did
you
indeed
i
confess
i
am
astonished
i
gave
you
the
credit
of
possessing
a
more
tender
heart
frankly
then
i
did
i
must
say
i
do
like
to
go
to
church
to
be
made
uncomfortable
did
you
find
that
sentence
in
the
paper
flossy
asked
a
little
gleam
of
mischief
in
her
eyes
because
if
you
did
i
should
have
thought
you
would
have
considered
it
answered
very
well
by
the
comments
as
a
rule
i
am
not
obliged
to
resort
to
the
papers
to
find
remarks
to
quote
baker
said
with
an
attempt
at
gayety
which
but
half
concealed
the
evident
annoyance
that
he
felt
but
i
judge
the
paper
found
some
one
suffering
in
the
same
way
pray
what
was
the
answer
why
the
writer
said
that
he
supposed
no
one
liked
to
be
uncomfortable
but
whether
it
was
the
sermon
that
should
change
or
the
life
in
order
to
remove
the
discomfort
was
a
question
for
each
to
decide
for
himself
sharp
said
charlie
laughing
you
got
hit
baker
oh
no
he
said
not
at
all
do
you
see
the
author
kindly
accorded
permission
for
each
person
to
decide
the
question
for
himself
now
i
have
it
decided
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
prefer
a
change
in
the
sermon
oh
dennis
is
a
good
man
no
one
doubts
it
but
he
is
too
severe
a
sermonizer
his
own
church
officers
admit
that
he
is
really
driving
the
young
people
away
from
the
church
i
should
not
be
greatly
surprised
if
there
had
to
be
a
change
in
that
locality
very
soon
the
spirit
of
the
times
demands
more
liberality
and
a
larger
measure
of
christian
charity
baker
was
really
too
well
educated
a
man
to
have
allowed
himself
to
use
these
terms
without
knowledge
or
thought
as
to
their
meaning
but
the
truth
was
he
cared
so
little
about
church
and
christian
charity
and
all
those
phrases
as
to
have
very
little
idea
of
what
he
meant
himself
when
he
used
them
but
pretty
little
flossy
had
never
argued
with
him
never
been
known
to
argue
with
anybody
why
should
he
not
occasionally
awe
her
with
his
high
sounding
words
it
is
a
pity
that
ruth
or
marion
had
not
been
there
to
take
up
the
theme
and
yet
it
is
doubtful
if
arguments
would
have
had
any
weight
with
him
the
truth
was
he
did
not
need
to
be
convinced
probably
flossy
perfect
gravity
and
dignity
and
silence
did
more
to
answer
him
than
any
keen
words
could
have
done

chapter
new
music
charlie
arose
suddenly
and
went
toward
the
piano
things
were
becoming
uncomfortably
grave
sis
he
said
ca
you
give
us
some
new
music
try
this
new
piece
baker
has
heard
you
sing
it
i
do
think
it
is
remarkable
but
it
is
better
than
none
we
seem
to
have
a
very
small
list
of
music
that
will
pass
the
orthodox
line
for
sunday
use
both
he
and
flossy
had
sighed
over
the
dearth
of
pretty
things
that
were
suited
to
sunday
the
one
in
question
was
one
of
the
worst
of
its
kind
one
of
that
class
which
satan
seems
to
have
been
at
work
getting
up
for
the
purpose
of
lulling
to
rest
weak
consciences
sickly
sentimental
ideas
expressed
in
words
that
are
on
the
very
verge
of
silly
and
yet
with
just
enough
solemn
sounding
phrases
in
them
thrown
in
here
and
there
to
allow
them
to
be
caught
up
by
a
certain
class
and
pronounced
sacred
song
flossy
had
herself
selected
this
one
and
before
her
departure
for
chautauqua
had
pronounced
it
very
good
she
had
not
looked
at
it
since
she
came
home
charlie
spread
it
open
for
her
on
the
piano
then
returned
to
the
sofa
to
enjoy
the
music
flossy
voice
was
sweet
and
tender
no
power
in
it
and
little
change
of
feeling
but
pleasant
to
listen
to
and
capable
of
being
tender
and
pathetic
she
looked
over
the
sacred
song
with
a
feeling
of
aversion
almost
amounting
to
disgust
the
pitiful
attempts
at
religion
sounded
to
her
recently
impressed
heart
almost
like
a
caricature
on
the
piano
beside
her
lay
a
copy
of
gospel
songs
open
so
it
happened
at
the
blessed
and
solemn
hymn
how
much
owest
thou
now
a
coincidence
that
seemed
remarkable
and
at
once
startled
and
impressed
flossy
was
that
dennis
text
for
the
evening
had
been
the
words
how
much
owest
thou
unto
my
lord
she
hesitated
just
a
moment
then
she
resolutely
pushed
aside
the
sheet
music
drew
the
book
toward
her
and
without
giving
herself
time
for
a
prelude
gave
herself
to
the
beautiful
and
words
how
much
owest
thou
for
years
of
tender
watchful
care
a
father
faith
a
mother
prayer
how
much
owest
thou
how
much
owest
thou
for
calls
and
warnings
loud
and
plain
for
songs
and
sermons
heard
in
vain
how
much
owest
thou
how
much
owest
thou
thy
day
of
grace
is
almost
the
judgment
time
is
just
before
how
much
owest
thou
how
much
owest
thou
oh
child
of
god
and
heir
of
heaven
thy
soul
redeemed
thy
sins
forgiven
how
much
owest
thou
flossy
had
heard
bliss
with
his
grand
and
glorious
voice
ring
that
out
on
a
certain
evening
at
chautauqua
where
all
the
associations
of
the
hour
and
place
had
been
solemn
and
sacred
it
might
have
been
in
part
these
memories
and
the
sense
of
something
missed
that
made
her
have
a
homesick
longing
for
the
place
and
song
again
that
gave
to
her
voice
an
unusually
sweet
and
plaintive
sound
every
word
was
plain
and
clear
and
wonderfully
solemn
but
when
she
reached
the
words
oh
child
of
god
and
heir
of
heaven
thy
soul
redeemed
thy
sins
forgiven
there
rang
out
a
note
of
triumph
that
filled
the
room
and
made
the
hearts
of
her
listeners
throb
with
surprise
and
wonder
long
before
the
song
was
closed
her
father
had
laid
aside
the
and
with
spectacles
pushed
above
his
eyes
was
listening
intently
absolute
silence
reigned
for
a
moment
as
flossy
voice
died
out
in
sweetness
then
charlie
clearing
his
throat
said
well
i
van
i
said
i
did
consider
the
song
remarkable
but
i
take
it
back
it
is
certainly
remarkable
did
you
ever
hear
anything
that
had
so
changed
since
you
last
met
it
baker
did
not
at
once
reply
the
very
first
line
had
struck
him
for
the
reason
that
above
most
men
he
had
reason
to
remember
a
mother
prayer
there
were
circumstances
connected
with
that
mother
of
his
that
made
the
line
doubly
startling
to
him
he
was
agitated
by
the
wonderful
directness
of
the
solemn
words
and
he
was
vexed
that
they
agitated
him
so
when
he
did
speak
to
conceal
his
feeling
he
made
his
voice
flippant
it
is
a
remarkable
production
worthy
of
i
should
say
but
miss
flossy
allow
me
to
congratulate
you
it
was
sung
with
striking
effect
flossy
arose
suddenly
from
the
piano
and
closed
the
book
of
hymns
baker
she
said
may
i
ask
you
to
excuse
me
this
evening
i
find
i
am
not
in
a
mood
to
enjoy
conversation
my
brother
will
entertain
you
i
am
sure
and
before
baker
could
recover
from
his
astonishment
sufficiently
to
make
any
reply
at
all
she
had
given
him
a
courteous
bow
for
and
escaped
from
the
room
the
situation
was
discussed
by
the
shipley
family
at
the
next
breakfast
table
flossy
had
come
down
a
trifle
late
looking
pale
and
somewhat
sober
and
was
rallied
by
kitty
as
to
the
cause
her
conscience
is
troubling
her
a
little
i
fancy
her
father
said
eyeing
her
closely
from
under
heavy
brows
were
you
just
a
little
hard
on
the
colonel
last
night
daughter
he
is
willing
to
endure
considerable
from
you
i
guess
but
i
would
try
him
too
far
what
was
the
trouble
father
what
has
flossy
done
now
i
thought
she
was
going
to
be
good
at
last
done
you
may
well
ask
what
miss
kitty
suppose
the
friend
you
had
shut
up
in
the
library
had
been
informed
suddenly
that
you
were
not
in
a
mood
to
talk
with
him
and
then
you
had
decamped
and
left
him
to
the
tender
mercies
of
two
men
why
flossy
shipley
you
did
do
that
did
you
really
if
i
were
baker
i
would
never
call
on
you
again
i
do
see
the
harm
flossy
said
simply
father
and
charlie
were
both
there
surely
that
was
company
enough
for
him
i
had
invited
him
to
call
oh
undoubtedly
he
calls
on
purpose
to
see
father
and
charlie
he
has
not
been
so
attentive
to
the
family
during
your
absence
i
can
assure
you
we
have
so
much
as
had
a
peep
at
him
since
you
went
away
flossy
i
had
an
idea
you
could
be
so
rude
i
declare
i
think
that
wilbur
girl
is
demoralizing
you
they
say
she
has
no
idea
of
considering
people
feelings
but
then
one
expects
it
of
her
class
shipley
came
to
flossy
aid
poor
child
i
do
blame
her
for
slipping
away
she
was
tired
she
had
been
to
church
twice
and
to
at
noon
without
any
lunch
too
flossy
you
must
indulge
in
such
an
absurd
freak
another
sunday
it
is
too
much
for
you
i
am
sure
it
is
not
strange
that
you
wanted
to
get
away
to
rest
then
the
father
i
dare
say
you
were
tired
as
your
mother
says
in
fact
though
i
must
say
i
think
i
never
saw
you
looking
better
than
you
were
last
evening
but
it
was
a
trifle
thoughtless
daughter
and
i
want
you
to
be
more
careful
in
the
future
baker
father
was
my
oldest
and
most
valued
friend
and
i
want
his
son
to
be
treated
with
the
utmost
consideration
and
to
feel
that
he
is
always
welcome
since
he
has
so
special
a
friendship
for
you
you
must
just
remember
that
his
position
in
society
is
one
of
the
highest
and
that
you
are
really
decidedly
honored
not
that
i
am
rebuking
you
flossy
dear
only
putting
you
on
your
guard
for
remember
that
you
carry
a
very
thoughtless
little
head
on
your
pretty
shoulders
and
then
he
leaned
over
and
patted
the
thoughtless
head
and
gave
the
glowing
cheek
such
a
loving
fatherly
kiss
as
for
poor
flossy
the
bit
of
steak
she
was
trying
to
swallow
seemed
to
choke
her
she
struggled
bravely
to
keep
back
the
tears
that
she
felt
were
all
ready
to
fall
the
way
looked
shadowy
to
her
she
felt
like
a
deceitful
coward
here
were
they
making
excuses
for
her
tired
thoughtless
and
the
like
oh
for
courage
to
say
to
them
that
she
had
not
been
tired
at
all
and
that
she
thought
about
that
action
of
hers
longer
than
she
had
thought
about
anything
in
her
life
up
to
a
few
weeks
ago
if
she
could
only
tell
them
out
boldly
and
plainly
that
everything
was
changed
to
her
that
she
looked
at
life
from
a
different
standpoint
and
that
standing
where
she
did
now
it
looked
all
wrong
to
spend
the
last
hours
of
the
sabbath
in
entertaining
company
but
her
poor
little
tongue
all
unused
to
being
brave
so
shrank
from
this
ordeal
and
the
lump
in
her
throat
so
nearly
choked
her
that
she
made
no
attempt
at
words
so
the
shadows
that
had
fallen
on
her
heart
grew
heavier
as
she
went
about
her
pretty
room
she
foresaw
a
troubled
future
not
only
must
the
explanation
come
but
she
foresaw
that
her
changed
plans
would
lie
right
athwart
the
views
and
plans
of
her
father
what
endless
trouble
and
discomfort
would
this
occasion
also
there
were
her
pet
schemes
for
including
those
boys
for
whom
she
had
already
planned
a
dozen
different
things
her
mother
had
frankly
expressed
her
opinion
and
although
it
is
not
the
age
when
parents
say
nor
were
flossy
parents
of
the
sort
who
would
ever
have
said
you
do
thus
and
you
not
do
so
still
she
foresaw
endless
discussions
sarcastic
raillery
from
kittie
and
charlie
persuasions
from
her
mother
earnest
protests
from
her
father
and
a
general
air
of
lack
of
sympathy
or
interest
about
them
all
these
things
were
to
flossy
almost
more
than
under
some
circumstances
the
martyr
stake
would
have
been
to
marion
wilbur
then
she
too
as
she
went
about
doing
sundry
little
things
toward
making
her
room
more
perfect
in
its
order
took
up
marion
fashion
of
pitying
herself
and
looking
longingly
at
the
brightness
in
some
other
life
not
marion
for
she
was
all
alone
and
had
great
responsibilities
and
no
one
to
shield
her
or
help
her
or
comfort
her
that
was
dreadful
not
ruth
for
her
life
was
so
high
up
among
books
and
paintings
and
grandeur
that
it
looked
like
cold
elegance
and
nothing
else
she
would
have
lived
that
life
but
there
was
eurie
mitchell
in
a
little
home
that
had
always
looked
sunny
and
cheerful
when
she
had
taken
occasional
peeps
into
it
somewhat
stirred
up
as
became
a
large
family
and
small
means
but
with
a
cleanly
cheery
sort
of
stir
that
was
agreeable
rather
than
otherwise
and
there
were
little
children
to
love
and
care
for
children
who
put
their
arms
around
one
neck
and
said
i
love
you
a
great
many
times
in
a
day
flossy
having
never
tried
it
did
not
realize
that
if
the
fingers
had
been
sticky
or
greasy
or
a
trifle
black
as
they
were
apt
to
be
it
would
be
an
exceeding
annoyance
to
her
she
saw
what
people
usually
do
see
about
other
people
cares
and
duties
only
the
pretty
pleasant
side
to
have
felt
somewhat
of
the
other
side
she
should
have
spent
that
monday
with
eurie
to
eurie
a
monday
rain
was
a
positive
affliction
it
necessitated
the
marshaling
of
tubs
and
pails
into
the
little
kitchen
and
the
endurance
of
maloney
presence
in
constant
contact
with
the
dinner
arrangements
on
pleasant
days
maloney
betook
herself
to
the
open
air
then
in
the
mitchell
family
there
was
that
trial
to
any
woman
of
ordinary
patience
a
small
girl
who
helped
worked
for
her
board
mornings
and
evenings
and
played
at
school
the
rest
of
the
time
sallie
whitcomb
the
creature
who
tried
eurie
was
rather
duller
than
the
most
of
her
class
and
had
her
days
or
spells
when
she
seemed
utterly
incapable
of
understanding
the
english
language
this
day
was
very
apt
to
be
monday
and
on
the
particular
monday
of
which
i
write
the
spell
was
on
her
in
full
force
to
add
to
the
bewilderments
of
the
day
mitchell
after
a
very
hurried
breakfast
had
departed
taking
the
household
genius
with
him
to
see
a
patient
and
friend
who
was
worse
i
do
know
how
you
will
manage
mitchell
had
said
as
she
paid
a
hasty
visit
to
the
kitchen
there
is
bread
to
mix
you
know
and
that
yeast
ought
to
be
made
and
then
the
starch
you
must
look
after
or
it
will
be
lumpy
and
oh
eurie
do
see
that
your
handkerchiefs
are
all
picked
up
he
leaves
them
around
so
you
must
keep
an
eye
on
the
baby
for
he
is
a
trifle
hoarse
this
morning
and
robbie
must
go
in
the
wind
must
eat
a
single
apple
for
he
is
at
all
well
you
must
see
to
that
eurie
i
would
have
you
forget
him
for
anything
see
here
when
the
baby
takes
a
nap
see
that
the
lower
sash
is
shut
there
is
quite
a
draught
through
the
room
i
do
know
how
you
are
to
get
through
you
must
keep
jennie
from
school
to
take
care
of
the
children
and
do
the
best
you
can
if
craymer
had
sent
for
me
i
would
go
this
morning
much
as
i
want
to
see
her
but
i
think
i
ought
to
as
it
is
of
course
eurie
said
cheerily
do
worry
about
us
mother
get
through
somehow
i
see
to
maloney
and
all
the
rest
well
be
careful
about
the
bread
do
let
it
get
too
light
and
for
anything
put
it
in
too
soon
it
was
a
trifle
heavy
last
week
you
know
and
your
father
dislikes
it
so
never
mind
much
about
dinner
your
father
will
have
to
go
to
two
or
three
places
when
he
gets
back
from
the
valley
and
i
can
get
up
a
warm
bite
for
him
while
he
is
gone
and
with
a
little
sigh
and
a
regretful
look
back
into
the
crowded
steamy
kitchen
mitchell
answered
her
husband
hurried
call
and
ran
so
eurie
was
left
mistress
of
the
occasion
it
looked
like
a
mountain
to
her
the
dishes
were
piled
higher
than
usual
for
the
sabbath
evening
lunch
had
made
many
that
had
not
been
washed
and
sallie
who
should
have
been
deep
into
them
already
was
at
that
moment
hanging
on
the
gate
she
had
gone
to
shut
and
watching
the
retreating
tail
of
the
doctor
horse
sallie
eurie
called
and
sallie
came
looking
bewildered
and
indolent
eating
an
apple
as
she
walked
now
sallie
you
must
hurry
with
the
dishes
see
how
soon
you
can
get
them
all
out
of
the
way
i
have
the
bread
to
mix
and
a
dozen
other
things
to
do
and
i
ca
help
you
a
bit
at
the
same
time
she
had
an
inward
consciousness
that
the
great
army
of
dishes
would
never
marshal
into
place
till
she
came
to
their
aid
this
was
the
beginning
not
a
pleasant
one
and
the
bewilderments
of
the
morning
deepened
with
every
passing
half
hour
what
happened
dear
me
what
inexperienced
eurie
who
rarely
had
the
family
bread
left
on
her
hands
went
to
mixing
it
before
getting
baking
tins
ready
and
sallie
left
her
dishes
to
attend
to
it
and
dripped
over
them
and
the
and
on
eurie
clean
apron
in
such
an
unmistakable
manner
that
the
annoyed
young
lady
washed
her
hands
of
dough
and
dumped
the
whole
pile
of
tins
unceremoniously
into
the
they
are
so
greasy
i
ca
touch
them
she
said
in
disdain
and
have
drops
of
all
over
them
and
besides
here
is
the
core
of
an
apple
in
one
i
wonder
sallie
if
you
eat
apples
while
you
are
washing
the
dishes
put
some
wood
in
the
stove
jennie
ca
you
come
here
and
wipe
these
dishes
we
wo
get
them
out
of
the
way
before
mother
comes
home
jenny
appeared
at
the
door
book
in
hand
how
can
i
leave
the
baby
eurie
robbie
says
he
ca
play
with
him
he
feels
too
sick
i
think
something
ought
to
be
done
for
robbie
his
cheeks
are
as
red
as
scarlet
whereupon
eurie
left
dishes
and
bread
and
went
in
to
feel
of
pulse
and
ask
how
he
felt
and
get
a
pillow
for
him
to
lie
on
the
lounge
and
the
baby
cried
for
her
and
had
to
be
taken
a
minute
so
the
time
went
time
always
goes
like
lightning
in
the
kitchen
on
monday
morning
when
that
bread
was
finally
set
to
rise
eurie
dismissed
sallie
from
the
in
disgust
with
orders
to
sweep
the
room
if
she
could
leave
her
apple
long
enough

vi
disturbing
elements
the
next
anxiety
was
the
baby
who
contrived
to
tumble
himself
over
in
his
high
chair
and
cried
loudly
eurie
ran
mitchell
was
always
so
troubled
about
bumps
on
the
head
she
bathed
this
in
cold
water
and
in
arnica
and
petted
and
soothed
and
pacified
as
well
as
she
could
a
child
who
thought
it
a
special
and
unendurable
state
of
things
not
to
have
mamma
and
nobody
else
between
the
petting
she
administered
wholesome
reproof
to
jennie
if
you
had
been
reading
instead
of
attending
to
him
this
would
not
have
happened
i
wish
i
had
told
mother
to
lock
up
all
the
books
before
she
went
you
are
great
help
worth
while
to
stay
from
school
to
bury
yourself
in
a
book
i
have
read
a
dozen
pages
this
morning
jennie
said
with
glowing
cheeks
he
was
sitting
in
his
high
chair
just
as
he
always
is
and
i
had
stepped
across
the
room
to
get
a
for
robbie
how
could
i
know
that
he
was
going
to
fall
i
do
think
you
are
very
kind
anyway
when
i
am
helping
all
that
i
can
and
losing
school
besides
and
miss
jennie
put
on
an
air
of
lofty
and
injured
innocence
i
believe
she
is
sweeping
right
on
the
bread
said
eurie
her
thoughts
turned
into
another
channel
go
and
see
jennie
jennie
went
and
returned
as
full
of
comfort
as
any
of
job
friends
she
swept
right
straight
at
it
and
she
left
the
door
open
and
the
wind
blew
the
cloth
off
and
a
great
hunk
of
dust
and
dirt
lies
right
on
top
of
one
loaf
and
the
clothes
are
boiling
over
on
the
others
nice
bread
you
have
before
this
sentence
was
half
finished
eurie
sat
the
baby
on
the
floor
and
ran
stopping
only
to
give
orders
that
jennie
should
not
let
him
go
to
sleep
for
anything
the
was
the
next
sound
that
tried
her
nerves
the
little
parlor
where
they
had
lingered
late
she
and
nellis
last
evening
when
they
had
a
pleasant
talk
together
the
pleasantest
she
had
ever
had
with
that
brother
now
she
remembered
how
it
looked
how
he
had
said
as
he
glanced
back
when
they
were
leaving
eurie
i
hope
you
wo
have
any
calls
before
you
get
around
to
this
room
in
the
morning
it
looks
as
though
there
had
been
an
upheaval
of
books
and
papers
here
books
and
papers
and
dust
and
her
hat
and
sack
and
jennie
gloves
and
robbie
she
had
forgotten
the
parlor
meantime
jennie
had
rushed
to
the
door
and
now
returned
holding
the
kitchen
door
open
and
talking
loud
enough
to
be
heard
distinctly
in
the
parlor
eurie
leonard
brooks
is
in
the
parlor
he
says
he
wants
to
see
you
for
just
a
minute
and
i
should
think
that
is
about
as
long
as
he
would
care
to
stay
it
looks
like
sixty
in
there
oh
dear
me
said
eurie
and
she
looked
down
at
her
dress
it
had
long
black
streaks
running
diagonally
across
it
and
and
grease
combined
on
her
apron
a
few
drops
of
arnica
on
her
sleeves
and
hands
did
not
improve
the
general
effect
jennie
why
in
the
world
did
you
tell
him
that
i
was
engaged
and
could
see
him
this
morning
why
how
should
i
know
that
you
wanted
me
to
say
so
to
people
you
did
tell
me
he
said
he
was
in
a
hurry
he
is
alone
either
there
is
a
strange
gentleman
with
him
worse
and
worse
i
wo
go
said
eurie
but
you
will
to
i
told
him
you
were
at
home
and
would
be
in
in
a
moment
go
on
what
do
you
care
there
was
no
way
but
to
follow
this
advice
but
she
did
care
she
set
the
starch
back
on
the
stove
and
washed
her
hands
and
waited
while
sallie
ran
and
hunted
a
towel
then
she
went
flushed
and
annoyed
to
the
parlor
leonard
brooks
was
an
old
acquaintance
but
who
was
the
stranger
holden
of
new
york
leonard
said
they
would
detain
her
but
a
moment
as
she
was
doubtless
engaged
and
then
leonard
looked
mischievously
down
at
the
streaked
dress
he
was
not
used
to
seeing
eurie
look
so
entirely
awry
in
the
matter
of
her
toilet
holden
was
going
to
get
up
a
tableau
entertainment
and
needed
home
talent
to
help
him
he
leonard
had
volunteered
to
introduce
him
to
some
of
the
talented
ladies
of
the
city
and
had
put
her
first
on
the
list
eurie
struggled
with
her
embarrassment
and
answered
in
her
usual
way
he
can
see
at
a
glance
that
i
merit
the
compliment
if
myself
and
all
my
surroundings
do
show
a
marked
talent
for
disorder
i
do
know
what
would
holden
was
courteous
and
gallant
in
the
extreme
he
took
very
little
notice
of
the
remark
ignored
the
state
of
the
room
utterly
apologized
for
the
unseemly
hour
of
their
call
attributing
it
to
his
earnest
desire
to
secure
her
name
before
there
was
any
other
engagement
made
might
he
depend
on
her
influence
and
help
eurie
was
in
a
hurry
she
smelled
the
starch
scorching
robbie
was
crying
fretfully
and
the
baby
was
so
quiet
she
feared
he
was
asleep
the
main
point
was
to
get
rid
of
her
callers
as
soon
as
possible
she
asked
few
questions
and
knew
as
little
about
the
projected
entertainment
as
possible
save
that
she
was
pledged
to
a
rehearsal
on
the
coming
wednesday
at
eight
then
she
bowed
them
out
with
a
sense
of
relief
and
merely
remarking
to
jennie
that
she
wished
she
could
coax
robbie
and
the
baby
into
the
parlor
and
clear
it
up
a
little
before
anybody
more
formidable
arrived
she
went
back
to
the
scorched
starch
and
other
trials
from
that
time
forth
a
great
many
people
wanted
mitchell
the
bell
rang
and
rang
and
rang
jennie
had
to
run
and
eurie
had
to
run
to
baby
then
came
noon
bringing
the
boys
home
from
school
hungry
and
in
a
hurry
and
eurie
had
to
go
to
sallie
help
who
was
struggling
to
get
the
table
set
and
something
on
it
to
eat
whereupon
the
bread
suddenly
announced
itself
ready
for
the
oven
by
spreading
over
of
the
bread
cloth
with
a
sticky
mass
then
the
bell
rang
again
i
hope
that
is
some
one
who
will
send
to
the
valley
for
father
right
away
then
we
shall
have
mother
again
this
was
eurie
half
aloud
admission
that
she
was
not
equal
to
the
strain
then
she
listened
for
jennie
report
the
parlor
door
being
opened
and
somebody
being
invited
thither
and
that
room
not
cleared
up
yet
then
came
jennie
with
her
exasperating
news
it
is
snowdon
from
morristown
and
he
wants
father
for
a
consultation
says
he
is
going
to
take
him
back
with
him
on
the
two
train
and
he
wants
to
know
if
you
could
let
him
have
a
mouthful
of
dinner
with
father
he
met
father
at
the
crossing
half
a
mile
below
and
he
told
him
to
come
right
on
and
where
is
mother
said
eurie
pale
and
almost
breathless
under
this
new
calamity
why
he
did
say
but
i
suppose
she
is
with
father
he
stopped
to
call
at
the
newton
i
guess
you
will
have
to
hurry
wo
you
jennie
was
provokingly
cool
and
composed
no
sense
of
responsibility
rested
upon
her
hurry
said
eurie
why
he
ca
have
any
dinner
here
we
have
a
thing
in
the
house
for
a
stranger
well
said
jennie
balancing
herself
on
one
foot
shall
i
go
and
tell
him
that
he
must
take
himself
off
to
a
hotel
nonsense
said
eurie
you
know
better
then
she
whisked
into
the
kitchen
twenty
minutes
of
one
and
the
train
went
at
ten
minutes
of
two
and
nothing
to
eat
and
snowdon
of
all
particular
and
gentlemanly
mortals
without
a
wife
or
a
home
or
any
sense
of
the
drawbacks
of
monday
to
eat
it
is
it
hardly
to
be
wondered
at
that
the
boys
voted
eurie
awfully
cross
altogether
it
was
just
the
most
horrid
time
that
ever
anybody
had
that
was
the
way
eurie
closed
the
account
of
it
as
she
sat
curled
on
the
foot
of
marion
bed
with
the
three
friends
who
had
been
listening
and
laughing
gathered
around
her
in
different
attitudes
of
attention
oh
you
can
laugh
and
so
can
i
now
that
it
is
over
eurie
said
but
i
should
just
like
to
have
seen
one
of
you
in
my
place
it
was
no
laughing
matter
i
can
tell
you
it
was
just
the
beginning
of
vexations
though
the
whole
week
so
far
has
been
exasperating
in
every
respect
never
anything
went
less
according
to
planning
than
my
programme
for
the
week
has
each
of
her
auditors
could
have
echoed
that
but
they
were
silent
at
last
marion
asked
but
how
did
you
get
out
of
it
tell
us
that
now
a
dinner
of
any
kind
is
something
that
is
beyond
me
i
can
imagine
you
transfixed
with
horror
just
tell
us
what
you
did
why
you
will
wonder
who
came
to
my
rescue
but
i
tell
you
girls
nellis
is
the
best
fellow
in
the
world
if
i
was
half
as
good
a
christian
as
he
is
without
any
of
that
to
help
him
i
should
be
a
thankful
mortal
i
did
expect
him
thought
he
had
gone
away
for
the
day
but
when
he
came
he
took
in
the
situation
at
a
glance
half
a
dozen
words
of
explanation
set
him
right
mind
he
said
him
we
did
mean
to
have
dinner
so
early
but
we
flew
around
and
got
them
a
bite
then
let
do
it
what
will
the
bite
be
i
asked
and
i
stood
looking
up
at
him
like
a
ninny
who
had
never
gotten
a
meal
in
her
life
bread
and
butter
and
coffee
and
a
dish
of
sauce
and
a
pickle
or
something
of
that
sort
and
the
things
really
sounded
appetizing
as
he
told
them
off
he
said
grind
the
coffee
and
make
it
i
used
to
be
a
dabster
at
that
dish
when
i
was
in
college
jennie
you
set
the
table
and
ned
will
help
he
well
enough
for
that
i
know
and
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
it
he
had
us
all
at
work
baby
and
all
and
really
we
managed
to
get
up
quite
a
decent
meal
out
of
nothing
you
understand
had
it
ready
when
father
drove
up
and
he
said
it
was
as
good
a
dinner
as
he
had
had
in
a
week
but
oh
me
i
glad
such
days
do
come
very
often
you
see
none
of
you
know
anything
about
it
you
girls
with
your
kitchens
supplied
with
cooks
and
without
any
more
idea
of
what
goes
on
in
the
way
of
work
before
you
are
fed
than
though
you
lived
in
the
moon
what
do
you
know
about
such
a
day
as
i
have
described
here
marion
to
be
sure
who
has
about
as
empty
a
purse
as
mine
but
as
for
kitchens
and
wash
days
and
dinners
she
is
a
novice
i
know
all
about
those
last
articles
so
far
as
eating
them
is
concerned
marion
said
grimly
i
know
things
about
them
that
you
do
and
never
will
but
i
have
made
up
my
mind
that
living
a
christian
life
is
walking
on
a
feather
bed
whether
you
live
in
a
palace
or
a
and
teach
school
i
wonder
if
there
were
such
things
as
vexations
everywhere
i
do
doubt
it
ruth
erskine
said
speaking
more
quickly
than
was
usual
to
her
the
others
had
been
more
or
less
communicative
with
each
other
it
was
in
ruth
nature
to
tell
how
tried
and
dissatisfied
she
had
been
with
herself
and
her
life
and
her
surroundings
all
the
week
she
was
not
sympathetic
by
nature
she
could
tell
her
inward
feeling
to
any
one
but
she
could
indorse
heartily
the
discovery
that
marion
had
made
well
i
know
one
thing
said
eurie
it
requires
twice
the
grace
that
i
supposed
it
did
to
get
through
with
kitchen
duties
and
exasperations
and
keep
one
temper
i
shall
think
after
this
that
mother
is
a
saint
when
she
gets
through
the
day
without
boxing
our
ears
three
or
four
times
around
come
let
go
to
meeting
it
was
wednesday
evening
and
our
four
girls
had
met
to
talk
over
the
events
of
the
week
and
to
keep
each
other
countenance
during
their
first
it
is
almost
worse
than
going
to
eurie
said
as
they
went
up
the
steps
except
that
we
can
help
ourselves
to
seats
without
waiting
for
any
attentions
which
would
not
be
shown
now
the
first
church
people
were
not
given
to
going
to
it
is
somewhat
remarkable
how
many
first
churches
there
are
to
which
that
remark
will
apply
the
chapel
was
large
and
inviting
looking
as
though
in
the
days
of
its
planning
many
had
been
expected
at
the
social
meetings
or
else
it
was
built
with
an
eye
to
festivals
and
societies
the
size
of
the
room
only
made
the
few
persons
who
were
in
it
seem
fewer
in
number
than
they
were
flossy
had
been
to
several
times
before
with
a
cousin
who
visited
them
but
none
of
the
others
had
attended
such
a
meeting
since
they
could
remember
to
eurie
and
ruth
it
was
a
real
surprise
to
see
the
rows
of
empty
seats
as
for
marion
she
had
overheard
sarcastic
remarks
enough
in
the
watchful
and
critical
world
in
which
she
had
moved
to
have
a
shrewd
suspicion
that
such
was
the
case
i
do
know
where
to
sit
whispered
flossy
shrinking
from
the
gaze
of
several
heads
that
were
turned
to
see
who
the
new
comers
were
you
suppose
they
will
seat
us
not
they
said
eurie
do
you
remember
sunday
we
must
just
put
the
courageous
face
on
and
march
forward
i
going
directly
to
the
front
i
always
said
if
ever
i
went
to
at
all
i
should
act
as
though
i
was
ashamed
that
i
came
saying
which
she
led
the
way
to
the
second
seat
from
the
desk
directly
in
line
with
dennis
eye
that
gentleman
looked
down
at
them
with
troubled
face
marion
looked
to
see
it
light
up
for
she
said
in
her
heart
gracie
has
surely
told
him
my
secret
she
knew
little
about
the
ways
in
the
busy
minister
household
the
delightful
communion
of
feeling
that
she
had
imagined
between
father
and
daughter
was
almost
unknown
to
them
very
fond
and
proud
of
his
daughter
was
dennis
very
careful
of
her
health
and
her
associations
very
grateful
that
she
was
a
christian
and
so
safe
but
so
busy
and
harassed
was
his
life
so
endless
were
the
calls
on
his
time
and
his
patience
and
his
sympathy
that
almost
without
his
being
aware
of
it
his
own
family
were
the
only
members
of
his
church
who
never
received
any
pastoral
calls
consequently
a
reserve
like
unto
that
in
too
many
households
had
grown
up
between
himself
and
his
child
utterly
unsuspected
by
the
father
never
but
half
owned
by
the
daughter
he
thought
of
her
religious
life
with
joy
and
thanksgiving
when
she
went
astray
was
careful
and
tender
in
his
admonition
yet
of
the
inner
workings
of
her
life
of
her
reaching
after
higher
and
better
living
of
her
growth
in
grace
or
her
days
of
disappointment
and
failure
and
decline
he
knew
no
more
than
the
veriest
stranger
with
whom
she
never
spoke
for
while
grace
dennis
loved
and
reverenced
her
father
more
than
she
did
any
other
earthly
being
she
acknowledged
to
herself
that
she
could
not
have
told
him
even
of
the
little
conversation
between
her
teacher
and
herself
she
could
and
did
tell
him
all
about
the
lesson
in
algebra
but
not
a
word
about
the
lesson
in
christian
love
so
on
this
evening
his
face
expressed
no
satisfaction
in
the
presence
of
the
strangers
he
was
simply
disturbed
that
they
had
formed
a
league
to
meet
here
with
mischief
ahead
as
he
verily
believed
he
arose
and
read
the
opening
hymn
then
looked
about
him
in
a
disturbed
way
nobody
to
lead
the
singing
this
was
too
often
the
case
the
quartette
choir
rarely
indeed
found
their
way
to
the
and
when
the
one
who
was
a
occasionally
came
to
the
weekly
meeting
for
reasons
best
known
to
herself
apparently
the
power
of
song
for
which
she
received
so
good
a
salary
had
utterly
gone
from
her
for
she
never
opened
her
lips
i
hope
said
dennis
that
there
is
some
one
present
who
can
start
this
tune
it
is
simple
a
without
singing
loses
half
its
spiritual
force
still
everyone
was
dumb
i
am
sorry
that
i
can
not
sing
at
all
he
said
again
after
a
moment
pause
if
i
could
ever
so
little
it
would
be
my
delight
to
consecrate
my
voice
to
the
service
of
god
house
still
silence
all
this
made
marion
remember
her
resolves
at
chautauqua
what
tunes
do
people
sing
in
she
whispered
to
eurie
i
do
know
i
am
sure
eurie
whispered
back
and
then
the
ludicrous
side
happened
to
forcibly
strike
that
young
lady
just
then
she
shook
with
laughter
and
shook
the
seat
dennis
looked
down
at
her
with
grave
rebuking
eye
well
he
began
if
we
can
not
sing
and
then
before
he
had
time
to
say
further
a
soft
sweet
voice
so
tremulous
it
almost
brought
the
tears
to
think
what
a
tremendous
stretch
of
courage
it
had
taken
quivered
on
the
air
illustration
illustration
chapter
vii
and
tableaux
it
was
flossy
who
had
triumphed
again
over
self
and
a
strong
natural
timidity
her
voice
trembled
but
for
an
instant
then
it
was
literally
absorbed
in
the
rich
full
tones
which
marion
allowed
to
roll
out
from
her
throat
richer
fuller
stronger
than
they
would
have
been
had
she
not
again
received
this
sharp
rebuke
from
the
timid
baby
of
their
party
but
that
voice
of
hers
i
wish
i
could
describe
it
to
you
it
is
not
often
that
one
hears
such
a
voice
such
an
one
had
never
been
heard
in
that
room
and
the
few
occupants
were
surely
justified
in
twisting
their
heads
to
see
from
whence
it
came
it
was
still
a
new
thing
to
marion
to
sing
such
words
as
were
in
that
hymn
and
in
the
beauty
of
them
and
the
enjoyment
of
their
richness
she
lost
sight
of
self
and
the
attention
she
was
attracting
and
sang
with
all
her
heart
it
so
happened
that
every
one
of
the
three
friends
could
help
her
not
a
little
so
our
girls
had
the
singing
in
their
own
hands
for
the
evening
when
the
next
hymn
was
announced
marion
leaned
forward
smiling
a
little
and
covered
with
her
firm
strong
hand
the
trembling
little
gloved
hand
of
flossy
and
herself
gave
the
in
clear
strong
tones
that
neither
faltered
nor
trembled
you
taken
up
your
little
cross
bravely
she
whispered
afterward
shown
me
my
duty
and
shamed
me
into
it
the
very
lightest
end
of
it
shall
not
rest
on
you
any
more
notwithstanding
the
singing
and
finding
that
it
could
be
well
done
dennis
took
care
to
see
that
there
should
be
much
of
it
that
meeting
dragged
the
few
who
were
in
the
habit
of
saying
anything
waited
until
the
very
latest
moment
as
if
hopeful
that
they
might
find
a
way
of
escape
altogether
and
yet
when
once
started
talked
on
as
though
they
had
forgotten
how
to
arrange
a
suitable
closing
and
must
therefore
go
on
then
the
prayers
seemed
to
our
and
in
prayer
very
strange
and
unnatural
do
you
suppose
mr
helm
really
feels
such
a
deep
interest
in
everything
under
the
sun
queried
eurie
or
did
he
pray
for
all
the
world
in
detail
because
that
is
the
proper
way
to
do
someway
i
do
feel
as
if
i
could
ever
learn
to
pray
in
that
way
i
believe
i
shall
have
to
ask
for
just
what
i
want
and
then
stop
if
you
succeed
in
keeping
to
the
latter
part
of
your
determination
you
will
do
better
than
the
most
of
them
marion
said
i
ca
help
thinking
that
the
worst
feature
of
it
is
the
keeping
on
long
after
the
person
wants
to
stop
now
i
tell
you
girls
that
is
not
the
way
they
prayed
at
chautauqua
is
it
well
said
flossy
it
is
not
the
way
dennis
prays
either
but
then
he
has
a
theological
education
that
makes
a
difference
i
suppose
no
it
does
you
mouse
make
a
speck
of
difference
that
old
uncle
billy
as
they
call
him
who
sat
down
by
the
door
in
the
corner
a
theological
education
nor
any
other
sort
of
education
did
he
speak
one
single
sentence
according
to
rule
yet
did
you
notice
his
prayer
different
from
most
of
the
others
he
meant
it
but
you
would
say
that
none
of
the
others
meant
it
ruth
said
speaking
hesitatingly
and
questioningly
no
marion
answered
slowly
i
suppose
not
of
course
yet
there
is
something
the
matter
with
them
it
may
be
that
the
ones
who
make
them
may
feel
them
but
they
do
succeed
in
making
me
feel
well
honestly
said
eurie
i
disappointed
i
have
heard
that
people
who
were
really
christians
liked
to
go
to
better
than
anywhere
else
but
i
feel
awfully
wicked
about
it
but
as
true
as
i
live
i
have
been
in
places
that
i
thought
were
ever
so
much
pleasanter
than
it
was
there
this
evening
now
to
tell
the
plain
truth
some
of
the
time
i
was
dreadfully
bored
i
specially
disappointed
too
for
i
had
a
plan
to
trying
to
coax
nellis
into
going
with
me
but
i
really
do
know
whether
i
want
him
to
go
or
not
but
this
talk
was
when
they
were
on
their
way
homeward
before
that
as
they
went
down
the
steps
eurie
said
what
plans
have
you
for
the
evening
girls
wo
you
go
with
me
and
then
she
went
back
to
that
tormenting
monday
and
told
of
leonard
brooks
call
with
his
friend
holden
and
of
the
tableau
entertainment
to
which
she
was
pledged
they
had
all
heard
more
or
less
of
it
and
all
in
some
form
or
other
had
received
petitions
for
help
but
none
of
them
had
come
in
direct
contact
with
it
save
eurie
and
it
appeared
that
the
rest
of
them
had
given
the
matter
very
little
attention
still
they
were
willing
to
go
with
eurie
and
see
what
was
to
be
seen
at
least
they
walked
on
in
that
direction
dennis
and
his
daughter
were
directly
behind
them
as
they
neared
a
street
corner
he
came
up
to
eurie
and
marion
who
were
walking
together
with
a
pleasant
something
in
manner
of
singing
the
hymn
had
interested
him
and
also
he
was
interested
in
learning
if
he
could
what
motive
had
brought
them
to
so
unusual
a
place
as
the
it
is
a
lovely
evening
for
a
walk
he
said
but
miss
wilbur
you
do
propose
to
take
it
alone
i
hope
is
your
boarding
place
at
some
distance
she
was
not
going
directly
home
marion
explained
not
caring
to
admit
the
loneliness
and
also
what
evidently
seemed
to
dennis
the
impropriety
of
having
to
traverse
the
street
alone
so
often
that
it
had
failed
to
seem
a
strange
thing
to
her
eurie
volunteered
further
information
we
are
going
up
to
annesley
hall
to
make
arrangements
for
the
tableau
entertainment
now
it
so
happened
that
dennis
knew
more
about
the
tableau
entertainment
than
eurie
did
and
his
few
minutes
of
feeling
that
perhaps
he
had
misjudged
those
girls
departed
at
once
so
did
his
genial
manner
indeed
he
said
in
the
coldest
tone
imaginable
and
almost
immediately
dropped
back
with
his
daughter
there
was
a
gentleman
hurrying
down
the
walk
evidently
for
the
purpose
of
overtaking
him
at
this
moment
he
pronounced
the
doctor
name
walk
on
grace
i
will
join
you
in
a
moment
the
girls
heard
dennis
say
and
grace
stepped
forward
alone
marion
glanced
back
but
a
few
weeks
ago
it
would
have
been
nothing
to
her
that
grace
dennis
or
anyone
else
walked
alone
so
that
she
had
no
need
for
their
company
but
the
law
of
unselfishness
which
is
the
very
essence
of
a
true
christian
life
was
already
beginning
to
work
unconsciously
in
this
girl
heart
and
it
made
her
turn
now
and
say
to
grace
with
winning
voice
have
you
lost
your
companion
come
and
walk
with
us
until
you
can
have
him
again
miss
mitchell
miss
dennis
it
was
a
fact
that
though
eurie
was
of
the
same
church
with
grace
dennis
and
though
she
knew
grace
by
sight
and
bowed
to
her
in
the
daytime
their
familiarity
with
each
other
was
not
so
sufficient
as
to
insure
a
recognition
we
know
each
other
grace
said
brightly
at
least
we
ought
to
we
do
when
we
see
each
other
plainly
enough
i
have
been
meaning
to
call
with
papa
miss
mitchell
but
i
have
been
able
to
yet
i
am
only
a
school
girl
you
know
eurie
preferred
to
ignore
the
calling
question
she
had
little
sympathy
with
that
phase
of
fashionable
life
so
she
plunged
at
once
into
another
subject
are
you
going
to
the
hall
miss
dennis
to
help
in
getting
up
the
tableau
entertainment
something
in
the
quick
way
in
which
grace
dennis
said
oh
no
made
marion
anxious
to
question
further
why
not
she
asked
miss
mitchell
says
they
want
all
the
ladies
of
talent
i
sure
you
and
i
ought
to
be
there
i
can
imagine
you
in
a
splendid
tableau
gracie
perhaps
you
would
better
go
and
help
to
be
sure
i
have
been
really
invited
myself
but
i
guess
i
can
get
in
somehow
wo
you
go
with
us
now
i
ca
miss
wilbur
i
should
like
to
go
i
enjoy
tableaux
ever
so
much
but
papa
does
not
approve
of
making
tableaux
of
scripture
scenes
you
know
ministers
have
to
be
in
advance
on
all
these
subjects
grace
spoke
in
an
apologetic
tone
and
with
a
flushed
face
as
one
who
had
been
obliged
into
saying
a
rude
thing
and
must
make
it
sound
as
best
she
could
are
they
to
be
scripture
scenes
eurie
asked
and
in
the
same
breath
added
why
does
he
disapprove
i
do
think
i
could
give
his
reasons
he
thinks
them
irreverent
sometimes
i
fancy
but
i
am
not
sure
i
never
heard
him
say
very
much
on
the
subject
but
i
know
quite
well
that
he
would
not
like
me
to
go
do
you
know
miss
mitchell
that
clergymen
always
have
to
stand
aloof
from
so
many
things
because
they
are
set
up
as
examples
for
others
to
follow
but
what
is
the
use
of
it
if
others
do
follow
said
eurie
we
must
look
into
this
question
i
have
never
thought
of
it
it
will
have
to
be
put
down
with
that
long
list
of
subjects
on
which
i
have
never
had
any
thoughts
that
list
swells
every
day
at
this
point
dennis
somewhat
decidedly
summoned
his
daughter
to
his
side
and
it
was
after
they
had
turned
onto
another
street
that
the
girls
took
the
into
consideration
they
were
still
talking
of
it
when
they
reached
the
hall
quite
a
company
were
assembled
among
them
eurie
brother
who
was
to
meet
her
there
and
baker
who
had
come
for
the
purpose
of
meeting
flossy
much
to
her
discomfiture
holden
and
leonard
brooks
came
over
to
the
seat
which
they
had
taken
and
the
former
was
presented
to
the
rest
of
the
party
this
is
capital
nellis
mitchell
said
holden
i
congratulate
you
i
knew
flossy
would
help
and
possibly
miss
wilbur
but
i
will
confess
to
not
even
hoping
for
you
miss
erskine
if
your
hopes
are
necessary
to
the
completion
of
this
scheme
i
advise
you
not
to
raise
them
high
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
for
they
will
have
a
grievous
fall
i
am
the
most
indifferent
of
spectators
this
from
ruth
in
her
most
formal
and
haughty
tone
nellis
mitchell
was
not
one
of
her
favorites
oh
you
will
help
us
will
you
not
holden
asked
in
a
tone
so
familiar
and
friendly
that
ruth
flushed
as
she
answered
thank
you
no
whereupon
holden
discovered
himself
to
be
silenced
never
mind
leonard
brooks
said
we
have
enough
helpers
promised
to
make
the
thing
a
grand
success
eurie
let
me
show
you
the
picture
of
one
which
we
have
planned
for
you
the
scenic
effect
is
really
very
fine
oriental
you
know
and
you
will
light
up
splendidly
in
that
picture
thank
you
said
eurie
in
an
tone
and
she
had
to
be
twice
recalled
from
her
thoughts
before
she
turned
to
look
at
the
plate
spread
before
her
on
the
instant
an
angry
flush
arose
spreading
itself
over
her
face
as
she
looked
you
do
not
mean
that
you
are
to
present
this
she
said
at
length
why
not
asked
leonard
in
astonishment
holden
hastened
to
explain
it
is
not
often
chosen
for
tableaux
i
admit
but
on
that
account
is
all
the
more
desirable
we
want
to
get
away
from
the
ordinary
sort
this
is
magnificent
in
its
working
up
i
had
it
in
new
york
last
winter
and
it
was
one
of
the
finest
presented
it
will
not
be
presented
with
my
help
eurie
tone
was
so
cold
and
haughty
that
marion
turned
toward
her
in
surprise
and
for
the
first
time
glanced
at
the
plate
why
miss
mitchell
holden
exclaimed
i
am
surprised
and
grieved
if
i
have
annoyed
you
by
my
selection
i
was
thinking
how
well
you
would
light
up
an
oriental
scene
is
it
the
representation
of
the
saviour
that
you
dislike
i
can
not
see
why
that
should
be
objectionable
it
is
dealing
with
him
as
a
mere
man
you
know
it
is
simply
an
oriental
dress
of
a
male
figure
that
we
want
to
represent
and
this
figure
of
christ
as
he
sat
at
the
well
is
so
exceedingly
minute
and
so
carefully
drawn
that
it
works
up
finely
christ
at
the
well
of
samaria
read
flossy
now
bending
over
the
book
and
her
eyes
and
cheeks
told
the
story
of
her
aversion
to
the
idea
who
be
willing
to
personate
the
saviour
holden
was
prompt
with
his
answer
i
have
had
not
the
slightest
difficulty
in
that
matter
my
friend
baker
here
expressed
himself
as
entirely
willing
to
undertake
it
why
my
dear
young
ladies
you
see
it
is
nothing
but
the
masculine
form
of
dress
that
we
want
to
bring
out
there
is
really
nothing
more
irreverent
in
it
than
there
is
in
your
looking
at
this
picture
here
then
we
will
not
look
longer
at
the
picture
eurie
said
drawing
back
suddenly
the
color
on
her
face
deepening
into
crimson
it
is
useless
for
you
to
undertake
an
argument
with
me
i
will
be
very
plain
with
you
and
inform
you
that
aside
from
the
irreverent
nature
of
the
tableau
i
consider
myself
insulted
in
being
chosen
to
make
a
public
representation
of
that
character
i
am
certainly
absolved
from
my
promise
holden
and
i
beg
you
to
withdraw
my
name
from
your
list
at
once
holden
turned
the
leaf
on
the
offending
picture
he
was
amazed
and
grieved
he
had
looked
at
the
picture
purely
in
an
artistic
light
he
supposed
all
people
looked
thus
at
tableau
pictures
it
was
certainly
a
compliment
that
he
meant
to
pay
and
not
the
shadow
of
a
discourtesy
but
since
they
looked
at
it
in
that
singular
manner
of
course
it
should
be
withdrawn
from
the
lists
nothing
further
should
be
said
about
it
let
him
show
them
just
allow
him
to
show
them
one
plate
which
was
the
very
finest
in
scenic
effect
of
anything
that
he
had
ever
gotten
up
the
name
of
it
was
the
ancient
feast
eurie
turned
hotly
away
but
flossy
and
ruth
looked
it
was
a
representation
of
belshazzar
at
his
impious
feast
at
the
time
when
he
was
arrested
by
the
handwriting
on
the
wall
ruth
erskine
curled
her
handsome
lip
into
something
like
a
sneer
does
baker
kindly
propose
to
aid
you
in
representing
the
hand
of
god
she
said
in
her
haughtiest
tones
he
is
so
willing
to
lend
himself
to
the
other
piece
of
sacrilege
that
one
can
hardly
expect
him
to
shrink
even
from
this
holden
promptly
closed
his
book
there
is
some
mistake
he
said
i
supposed
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
gathered
here
came
in
for
the
purpose
of
helping
not
for
ridiculing
of
course
if
we
differ
so
entirely
on
these
topics
we
can
be
of
very
little
help
to
each
other
so
i
should
judge
marion
said
and
that
being
the
case
shall
we
go
what
nonsense
said
leonard
brooks
following
after
the
retreating
party
but
speaking
only
in
a
low
tone
and
addressing
eurie
one
expects
such
lofty
humbug
from
miss
erskine
and
even
from
miss
wilbur
the
tragic
is
in
her
line
but
i
thought
you
would
enter
into
and
enjoy
the
whole
thing
i
told
holden
that
you
would
be
the
backbone
of
the
matter
thank
you
said
eurie
her
voice
half
choked
with
indignation
and
wounded
pride
and
i
presume
you
assisted
in
the
selection
of
the
characters
that
i
should
personate
as
i
said
i
consider
myself
insulted
please
allow
me
to
pass
much
excited
and
some
of
them
very
much
ashamed
they
all
found
themselves
on
the
street
again
nellis
mitchell
being
the
only
one
of
the
astonished
gentlemen
who
had
bethought
himself
or
had
had
sufficient
courage
to
join
them
well
what
next
he
said
nell
said
eurie
what
do
you
think
of
that
nellis
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
is
not
according
to
my
way
of
thinking
he
said
but
they
told
me
you
had
promised
and
i
thought
if
you
had
with
your
eyes
open
it
was
none
of
my
business
i
congratulate
you
on
being
fairly
out
of
it
that
holden
is
a
scamp
i
believe
and
baker
was
going
to
take
that
character
said
flossy
to
herself
and
eurie
in
her
heart
felt
grieved
and
hurt
that
her
friend
of
long
standing
leonard
brooks
could
have
said
and
done
just
what
he
had
he
could
never
be
to
her
as
though
he
had
not
said
and
done
those
things
as
for
marion
all
she
said
was
i
begin
to
have
a
clearer
idea
of
what
grace
dennis
and
her
father
mean
illustration
illustration
chapter
viii
dennis
study
they
walked
on
in
absolute
silence
for
a
few
minutes
each
busy
with
her
own
thoughts
eurie
was
the
first
to
speak
girls
i
propose
we
go
and
call
on
dr
dennis
ruth
and
marion
uttered
exclamations
of
dismay
or
it
might
have
been
of
surprise
flossy
spoke
you
do
mean
now
this
minute
we
have
an
hour
at
our
disposal
and
we
are
all
together
why
not
and
have
it
over
with
i
tell
you
that
man
is
afraid
of
us
and
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
why
should
he
not
be
what
have
we
ever
done
to
help
his
work
and
how
much
we
may
have
done
to
hinder
it
i
never
realized
how
much
until
this
present
moment
it
enrages
me
to
think
how
many
enterprises
like
this
one
i
have
been
engaged
in
without
giving
it
a
thought
just
imagine
how
such
things
must
look
to
dr
dennis
but
eurie
you
have
never
been
mixed
in
with
anything
like
that
performance
as
it
is
to
be
what
do
you
mean
by
admitting
it
it
was
ruth
who
spoke
in
some
heat
the
association
rankled
in
her
heart
not
precisely
that
sort
of
thing
i
admit
but
what
must
be
the
reputation
i
have
earned
when
i
can
be
so
coolly
picked
out
for
such
work
i
tell
you
girls
i
am
angry
i
suppose
i
ought
to
be
grateful
for
my
eyes
have
certainly
been
opened
to
see
a
good
many
things
that
i
never
saw
before
but
it
was
a
rough
opening
shall
we
go
to
the
parsonage
or
not
oh
dear
i
do
feel
in
the
least
like
it
flossy
said
timidly
do
you
ever
expect
to
like
it
eurie
asked
still
speaking
hotly
for
myself
i
must
say
that
i
do
i
am
tired
of
my
place
i
want
to
be
admitted
and
belong
somewhere
it
is
entirely
evident
to
me
that
i
do
belong
where
i
did
i
have
discovered
that
a
great
many
things
about
me
are
changed
i
feel
that
i
shall
not
assimilate
well
let
me
get
in
where
i
can
have
a
chance
i
want
to
belong
to
that
for
instance
to
be
recognized
as
a
part
of
it
and
to
be
counted
in
a
place
so
do
you
flossy
i
am
sure
why
not
settle
the
matter
yes
flossy
certainly
wanted
to
belong
to
that
more
than
that
she
wanted
to
belong
to
that
class
her
heart
had
been
with
it
all
the
week
if
there
was
a
hope
that
she
might
be
permitted
to
try
it
for
awhile
she
was
willing
even
to
call
on
dennis
though
that
act
looked
awfully
formidable
to
her
i
suppose
it
is
very
silly
not
to
want
to
go
this
evening
as
well
as
any
time
she
admitted
at
last
of
course
it
is
marion
said
energetically
let
us
turn
this
corner
at
once
and
in
two
minutes
more
we
shall
have
rung
his
bell
then
that
will
settle
the
question
nothing
like
going
ahead
and
doing
things
without
waiting
to
get
into
the
mood
see
here
said
nellis
mitchell
speaking
for
the
first
time
please
to
take
into
consideration
what
you
propose
to
do
with
me
i
take
it
that
you
do
want
me
to
make
this
call
with
you
my
sister
has
been
remarkably
bewildering
in
her
remarks
but
i
gather
that
it
is
something
like
a
confidential
talk
that
you
are
seeking
with
the
doctor
into
which
i
am
not
to
be
admitted
i
forgot
that
you
were
along
said
eurie
with
her
usual
frankness
no
nell
we
do
want
you
to
call
with
us
not
this
time
i
might
ask
for
a
separate
room
and
make
my
call
on
miss
grace
at
least
i
might
try
it
but
i
doubt
her
father
permitting
such
a
tremendous
action
so
really
i
do
see
quite
what
you
are
to
do
with
me
i
am
entirely
at
your
disposal
see
here
nell
could
you
call
for
us
in
half
an
hour
say
girls
we
stay
half
an
hour
do
you
suppose
we
shall
have
to
do
something
of
the
kind
it
wo
do
for
us
to
go
home
alone
i
see
what
we
can
do
nell
you
go
to
father
office
and
wait
just
a
little
while
if
we
are
not
there
in
half
an
hour
you
can
call
for
us
at
dennis
and
if
we
find
we
are
not
equal
to
a
call
of
that
length
we
will
come
to
the
office
will
that
do
the
obliging
brother
made
a
low
bow
of
mock
ceremony
assured
her
that
he
was
entirely
at
her
service
that
she
might
command
him
and
he
would
serve
to
the
best
of
his
knowledge
and
ability
made
a
careful
minute
of
the
present
time
in
order
to
be
exact
at
the
half
hour
and
as
they
laughingly
declined
his
offer
to
ring
the
doctor
bell
for
them
he
lifted
his
hat
to
them
with
the
lowest
of
bows
and
disappeared
around
the
corner
he
is
such
a
dear
fellow
said
eurie
looking
fondly
after
him
i
do
see
in
what
respect
muttered
ruth
in
an
aside
to
flossy
ruth
had
a
special
aversion
to
this
young
man
possibly
it
might
have
been
because
he
treated
her
with
the
most
indifference
despite
all
her
dignity
and
coldness
meantime
in
dennis
study
his
daughter
was
hovering
around
among
the
books
trying
to
bring
order
out
of
confusion
on
the
shelves
and
table
and
at
the
same
time
find
a
favorite
volume
she
was
reading
the
doctor
turned
on
a
brighter
flame
of
gas
then
lowered
it
and
seemed
in
a
disturbed
state
of
mind
at
last
he
spoke
i
do
know
that
my
caution
is
needed
daughter
i
have
no
reason
to
think
that
it
is
from
anything
in
your
conduct
at
least
but
i
feel
like
saying
to
you
that
i
have
less
and
less
liking
for
those
young
ladies
who
seem
since
their
unfortunate
freak
of
attending
that
chautauqua
meeting
to
have
banded
themselves
together
i
can
hardly
imagine
why
they
are
certainly
unlike
enough
but
i
distrust
them
in
almost
every
way
i
am
sorry
that
you
are
at
school
under
miss
influence
not
that
i
dread
her
influence
on
you
except
in
a
general
way
at
this
point
grace
opened
her
bright
lips
to
speak
there
was
an
eager
sentence
glowing
on
her
tongue
but
her
father
had
not
finished
his
i
know
all
that
you
can
say
that
you
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
religious
or
views
and
that
she
is
a
splendid
teacher
i
do
doubt
it
but
i
repeat
to
you
that
i
distrust
all
of
them
i
do
know
why
they
have
seen
fit
to
come
to
our
and
to
our
meeting
this
evening
unless
it
be
to
gain
an
unhappy
influence
over
some
whom
they
desire
to
lead
astray
i
can
hardly
think
so
meanly
of
them
as
that
either
i
do
not
say
that
such
was
their
motive
but
simply
that
i
do
not
understand
it
and
am
afraid
of
it
and
i
desire
you
to
have
just
as
little
to
do
with
any
of
them
as
ordinary
civility
will
admit
hitherto
i
have
thought
of
ruth
erskine
as
simply
a
leader
of
fashion
and
of
flossy
shipley
as
the
tool
of
the
fashionable
world
but
i
am
afraid
their
dangerous
friends
are
leading
them
to
be
more
the
tableau
affair
i
have
investigated
to
a
certain
degree
and
i
consider
it
one
of
the
worst
of
its
kind
i
would
not
have
you
associated
with
it
for
well
any
consideration
that
i
can
imagine
and
yet
if
i
mistake
not
i
heard
them
urging
you
to
join
them
again
grace
essayed
to
speak
but
the
pealing
of
the
door
bell
interrupted
her
who
is
it
hannah
dennis
questioned
as
that
personage
peeped
her
head
in
at
the
door
it
is
four
young
ladies
dennis
and
they
want
to
see
you
grace
arose
to
depart
do
you
know
any
of
them
hannah
the
doctor
asked
well
sir
one
of
them
is
the
miss
wilbur
who
teaches
and
i
think
another
is
mitchell
daughter
i
do
know
the
others
show
them
in
here
said
dennis
promptly
and
daughter
you
will
please
remain
they
have
doubtless
come
to
petition
me
for
your
assistance
in
the
tableaux
and
i
have
not
the
least
desire
to
be
considered
a
household
tyrant
or
to
have
them
suppose
that
you
are
my
prisoner
i
would
much
rather
that
you
should
give
them
your
own
opinions
on
the
subject
like
a
brave
little
woman
but
father
grace
said
and
there
was
a
gleam
of
mischief
in
her
eye
i
have
any
opinions
on
this
subject
the
most
that
i
can
say
is
that
you
do
wish
me
to
have
anything
to
do
with
them
and
so
like
a
dutiful
daughter
i
decline
well
then
he
said
smiling
back
on
her
in
a
satisfied
way
show
them
how
gracefully
you
can
play
the
part
of
a
dutiful
daughter
while
you
are
so
young
and
while
i
am
here
to
have
opinions
for
you
the
dutiful
part
cheerfully
done
is
really
all
that
is
necessary
and
this
was
the
introduction
that
the
four
girls
had
to
the
study
how
shy
they
felt
ruth
could
hardly
ever
remember
of
feeling
so
very
much
embarrassed
as
for
eurie
she
began
to
feel
that
distressing
sense
of
the
ludicrous
creeping
over
her
and
so
was
horribly
afraid
that
she
should
laugh
marion
went
forward
to
grace
and
in
the
warm
glad
greeting
that
this
young
girl
gave
felt
her
heart
melted
and
warmed
dennis
confident
in
the
errand
that
had
brought
them
decided
to
lead
the
conversation
himself
and
give
them
no
chance
to
approach
the
topic
smoothly
have
you
done
up
the
tableaux
so
promptly
he
asked
and
while
he
addressed
his
question
to
marion
eurie
felt
that
he
right
at
her
marion
answer
was
prompt
and
to
the
point
yes
sir
we
have
miss
mitchell
was
the
only
one
of
us
who
was
pledged
and
i
believe
she
was
entirely
dissatisfied
with
the
character
of
the
entertainment
and
withdrew
her
support
indeed
dennis
manner
of
pronouncing
this
word
was
in
effect
saying
is
it
possible
that
there
can
be
an
entertainment
of
so
questionable
a
character
that
miss
mitchell
will
withdraw
from
it
at
least
that
was
the
way
the
word
sounded
to
eurie
but
she
had
been
roused
to
unusual
sensitiveness
the
effect
was
to
rouse
her
still
further
to
put
to
flight
every
trace
of
embarrassment
and
every
desire
to
laugh
she
spoke
in
a
clear
strong
voice
dennis
we
shall
be
talking
at
cross
purposes
if
we
do
not
make
some
explanation
of
our
object
in
calling
this
evening
we
feel
that
we
do
not
belong
in
the
society
where
you
are
classing
us
in
fact
we
do
not
belong
anywhere
our
views
and
feelings
have
greatly
changed
within
a
short
time
we
want
to
make
a
corresponding
change
in
our
associations
at
least
so
far
as
is
desirable
our
special
object
in
calling
just
now
is
that
we
know
it
will
soon
be
time
for
the
communion
in
your
church
and
we
have
thought
that
perhaps
we
ought
to
make
a
public
profession
of
our
changed
views
was
ever
a
man
more
bent
on
misunderstanding
plain
english
than
was
dennis
this
evening
he
looked
at
his
callers
in
an
astonished
and
embarrassed
way
for
a
moment
as
if
uncertain
whether
to
consider
them
lunatics
or
not
and
then
said
addressing
himself
to
eurie
my
dear
young
lady
i
fear
you
are
laboring
under
a
mistake
as
to
the
object
in
uniting
with
the
church
of
christ
and
the
preparation
necessary
you
know
as
a
church
we
hold
that
something
more
than
a
desire
to
change
one
social
relations
should
actuate
the
person
to
take
such
a
step
that
indeed
there
should
be
a
radical
change
of
heart
poor
eurie
she
thought
she
had
been
plain
in
her
explanation
she
flushed
and
commenced
a
stammering
sentence
then
paused
and
looked
appealingly
at
ruth
and
marion
finally
she
did
what
for
eurie
mitchell
to
do
was
unprecedented
lost
all
and
broke
into
a
sudden
and
passionate
gust
of
tears
eurie
do
marion
said
to
her
it
was
actual
pain
to
see
tears
as
for
dennis
he
was
very
much
at
his
wits
end
and
embarrassment
grew
upon
her
every
moment
flossy
came
to
the
rescue
dennis
she
said
and
he
noticed
even
then
that
her
voice
was
strangely
sweet
and
winning
eurie
means
that
we
love
jesus
and
we
believe
he
has
forgiven
us
and
called
us
by
name
we
mean
we
want
to
be
his
and
to
serve
him
forever
and
we
want
to
acknowledge
him
publicly
because
we
think
he
has
so
directed
how
simple
and
sweet
the
story
was
after
all
when
one
just
gave
up
attempting
to
be
proper
and
gave
the
quiet
truth
ruth
was
struck
with
the
simplicity
and
the
directness
of
the
words
she
began
to
have
not
only
an
admiration
but
an
unfeigned
respect
for
flossy
shipley
but
you
should
have
seen
dennis
face
it
is
a
pity
eurie
could
not
have
seen
it
at
that
moment
if
she
had
not
had
hers
buried
in
the
sofa
pillow
she
would
have
caught
the
quick
glad
look
of
surprise
and
joy
and
heartfelt
thankfulness
that
spoke
in
his
eyes
he
arose
suddenly
and
holding
out
his
hand
to
flossy
said
let
me
greet
you
and
thank
you
and
ask
you
to
forgive
me
in
the
same
breath
i
have
been
very
slow
to
understand
and
strangely
stupid
and
unsympathetic
i
feel
very
much
as
i
fancy
poor
doubting
thomas
must
have
done
forgive
me
i
am
so
astonished
and
so
glad
that
i
know
how
to
express
the
feeling
do
you
speak
for
all
your
friends
here
miss
flossy
and
may
i
ask
something
about
the
wonderful
experience
that
has
drawn
you
all
into
the
ark
but
flossy
courage
had
forsaken
her
it
was
born
of
sympathy
with
eurie
tears
she
looked
down
now
tearful
herself
and
trembling
like
a
leaf
ruth
found
voice
to
answer
for
her
our
experience
dennis
can
be
summed
up
in
one
word
chautauqua
dennis
gave
a
little
start
another
astonishment
do
you
mean
that
you
were
converted
during
that
meeting
marion
smiled
we
do
not
know
enough
about
terms
to
really
be
sure
that
that
is
the
right
one
to
use
she
said
at
least
i
do
not
but
we
do
know
this
that
we
met
the
lord
jesus
there
and
that
as
flossy
says
we
love
him
and
have
given
our
lives
into
his
keeping
you
can
not
say
more
than
that
after
a
hundred
years
of
experience
he
said
quickly
well
dear
friends
i
can
not
as
i
said
express
to
you
my
gratitude
and
joy
and
you
are
coming
into
the
church
and
are
ready
to
take
up
work
for
the
master
and
live
for
him
thank
the
lord
little
need
had
our
girls
to
talk
of
dennis
coldness
and
dignity
after
that
how
entirely
his
heart
had
melted
what
a
blessed
talk
they
had
so
many
questions
about
chautauqua
so
much
to
tell
that
delighted
him
they
had
not
the
least
idea
that
it
was
possible
to
feel
so
much
at
ease
with
a
minister
as
they
grew
to
feel
with
him
the
bell
rang
and
was
answered
and
yet
no
one
intruded
on
their
quiet
and
the
talk
went
on
until
marion
with
a
sudden
recollection
of
nellis
mitchell
and
their
appointment
with
him
stole
a
glance
at
her
watch
and
was
astonished
into
the
announcement
girls
we
have
been
here
an
hour
and
a
quarter
is
it
possible
ruth
said
rising
at
once
father
will
be
alarmed
i
am
afraid
dennis
rose
also
i
did
not
know
i
was
keeping
you
so
he
said
our
theme
was
a
fascinating
one
will
you
wait
a
moment
and
let
me
make
ready
to
see
you
safely
home
but
it
appeared
on
opening
the
door
that
nellis
mitchell
occupied
an
in
the
parlor
just
across
the
hall
i
a
patient
young
man
and
at
your
service
he
said
coming
toward
them
as
they
emerged
please
give
me
credit
for
promptness
i
was
here
at
the
half
hour
as
they
walked
home
nellis
with
his
sister
on
one
arm
and
flossy
shipley
on
the
other
he
said
now
what
am
i
to
understand
by
this
sudden
and
violent
intimacy
at
the
parsonage
miss
flossy
my
sister
has
hitherto
made
yearly
calls
of
two
seconds
duration
on
the
doctor
sister
when
she
is
not
home
to
receive
them
a
great
many
things
are
to
be
different
from
what
they
have
hitherto
been
flossy
said
with
a
soft
little
laugh
so
i
begin
to
perceive
nell
said
eurie
turning
back
when
she
was
half
way
up
the
stairs
having
said
are
you
going
to
help
them
with
those
tableaux
not
much
said
nellis
and
eurie
as
she
went
on
said
i
should
be
surprised
if
nell
felt
differently
about
some
things
from
what
he
used
to
oh
i
wonder
if
i
ca
coax
him
in

chapter
ix
a
white
sunday
among
other
topics
that
were
discussed
with
great
interest
during
that
call
at
dennis
was
the
and
the
place
that
our
girls
were
to
take
in
it
flossy
was
not
likely
to
forget
that
matter
her
heart
was
too
full
of
plans
concerning
those
boys
early
in
the
talk
she
overwhelmed
and
embarrassed
dennis
with
the
request
that
she
might
be
allowed
to
try
that
class
now
if
it
had
been
ruth
or
marion
who
had
made
the
same
request
it
would
have
been
unhesitatingly
granted
the
doctor
had
a
high
opinion
of
the
intellectual
abilities
of
both
these
young
ladies
and
now
that
they
had
appeared
to
consecrate
those
abilities
he
was
willing
to
receive
them
but
this
little
summer
butterfly
with
her
small
sweet
ways
and
winning
smile
he
had
no
more
idea
that
she
could
teach
than
that
a
could
and
of
all
classes
in
the
school
to
expect
to
do
anything
with
those
large
wild
boys
it
was
preposterous
my
dear
friend
he
said
and
he
could
hardly
keep
from
smiling
even
though
he
was
embarrassed
you
have
no
idea
what
you
are
asking
that
is
altogether
the
most
difficult
class
in
the
school
some
of
our
best
teachers
have
failed
there
the
fact
is
those
boys
do
to
be
instructed
they
are
in
search
of
fun
they
are
a
hard
set
i
am
really
afraid
i
would
have
you
tried
and
discouraged
by
them
we
are
at
a
loss
what
to
do
with
them
i
will
admit
for
no
one
who
can
do
it
seems
willing
to
try
them
in
fact
i
am
not
sure
that
we
have
anyone
who
i
understand
your
motive
miss
flossy
and
appreciate
your
zeal
but
you
must
not
crush
yourself
in
that
way
since
you
have
been
out
of
the
for
so
many
years
and
i
presume
have
not
made
the
bible
a
study
unhappily
it
is
not
used
as
a
text
book
in
many
of
our
schools
would
it
not
be
well
for
you
to
join
some
excellent
for
awhile
i
think
you
would
like
it
better
and
grow
faster
and
we
really
have
some
superior
teachers
among
the
and
while
he
said
this
the
wise
doctor
hoped
in
his
heart
that
she
would
not
be
offended
with
his
plain
speaking
and
that
some
good
angel
would
suggest
to
marion
wilbur
the
propriety
of
trying
that
class
of
boys
flossy
was
not
offended
though
marion
wilbur
spoken
to
in
the
same
way
would
have
been
certain
to
have
felt
it
little
flossy
though
sorely
disappointed
so
much
so
that
she
could
hardly
keep
the
tears
from
rising
admitted
that
she
did
not
know
how
to
teach
and
that
of
course
she
ought
to
study
the
bible
and
would
like
ever
so
much
to
do
so
it
so
happened
that
the
other
girls
were
more
than
willing
to
be
enrolled
as
pupils
indeed
had
not
an
idea
of
taking
any
other
position
so
after
a
little
more
talk
it
was
decided
that
they
all
join
dennis
class
every
one
of
them
expressing
a
prompt
preference
for
that
class
above
the
others
in
his
heart
dennis
entirely
approved
of
this
arrangement
for
he
wanted
the
training
of
flossy
and
eurie
and
he
meant
to
make
teachers
of
the
other
two
as
soon
as
possible
now
it
came
to
pass
that
an
element
came
into
all
this
planning
none
other
than
the
boys
themselves
they
had
ideas
of
their
own
and
they
belonged
to
that
part
of
the
world
which
is
hard
to
govern
they
would
have
miss
flossy
shipley
to
be
their
teacher
and
they
would
have
no
one
else
she
suited
them
exactly
and
no
one
else
did
but
my
dear
boys
dennis
said
miss
shipley
is
new
to
the
work
of
teaching
she
is
but
a
learner
herself
she
feels
that
her
place
is
in
the
so
that
she
may
acquire
the
best
ways
of
presenting
lessons
did
she
say
she
would
teach
us
queried
rich
johnson
with
his
keen
eyes
fixed
on
the
doctor
face
what
could
that
embarrassed
but
truthful
man
do
but
slowly
shake
his
head
and
say
hesitatingly
no
she
did
say
that
but
i
advised
her
to
join
a
for
awhile
then
we
want
her
rich
said
stoutly
do
we
boys
she
just
suits
us
dennis
and
she
is
the
first
one
we
ever
had
that
we
cared
a
snap
for
we
had
just
about
made
up
our
minds
to
quit
it
but
on
the
whole
if
we
can
have
her
we
will
give
it
another
trial
this
strange
sentence
was
uttered
in
a
most
business
way
and
the
perplexed
doctor
quite
unused
to
dealing
with
that
class
of
brain
and
manners
was
compelled
to
beat
a
retreat
and
come
to
flossy
with
his
novel
report
a
gleam
of
satisfaction
not
to
say
triumph
lighted
up
her
pretty
face
and
aglow
with
smiles
and
blushes
she
made
her
way
with
alacrity
to
her
chosen
class
teachers
and
scholars
thoroughly
suited
with
each
other
surely
they
could
do
some
work
during
that
hour
that
would
tell
on
the
future
meantime
the
superintendent
was
having
his
perplexities
over
in
another
corner
of
the
room
he
came
to
dennis
at
last
for
advice
miss
hart
is
absent
her
class
is
almost
impossible
to
supply
no
one
is
willing
to
try
the
little
midgets
miss
hart
dennis
repeated
thoughtfully
the
primary
class
eh
it
is
hard
to
manage
and
yet
with
all
the
present
one
would
think
it
might
be
done
they
are
not
all
present
stuart
said
they
never
are
dennis
ignored
this
remark
i
tell
you
what
to
do
he
said
with
a
sudden
lighting
up
of
his
thoughtful
face
get
miss
wilbur
to
go
in
there
she
is
equal
to
the
emergency
or
i
am
much
mistaken
stuart
started
in
unqualified
astonishment
i
thought
he
said
recovering
his
voice
that
you
seriously
objected
to
her
as
a
teacher
in
i
have
changed
my
mind
dennis
said
with
a
happy
smile
or
the
lord
has
changed
her
heart
ask
her
to
take
the
class
so
two
of
our
girls
found
work
another
thing
occurred
to
make
that
sabbath
a
memorable
one
the
evening
was
especially
lovely
and
there
happening
to
be
no
other
attraction
a
much
larger
number
than
usual
of
the
first
church
people
got
out
to
the
second
service
our
girls
were
all
present
and
what
was
unusual
other
representatives
from
their
families
were
with
them
also
baker
had
obliged
himself
to
endure
the
infliction
of
another
sermon
from
dennis
in
order
that
he
might
have
the
pleasure
of
a
walk
home
in
the
glorious
moonlight
with
miss
flossy
the
sermon
was
one
of
special
solemnity
and
power
the
pastor
recent
communion
with
souls
had
quickened
his
own
heart
and
increased
the
longing
desire
for
the
coming
of
the
spirit
of
god
into
their
midst
at
the
sermon
close
he
took
what
for
the
first
church
was
a
very
wide
and
startling
departure
from
the
beaten
track
after
a
tender
personal
appeal
especially
addressed
to
the
young
people
of
his
flock
he
said
now
impelled
by
what
i
can
not
but
feel
is
the
voice
of
the
lord
jesus
by
his
spirit
i
want
to
ask
if
there
are
any
present
who
feel
so
much
of
a
desire
to
be
numbered
with
the
lord
friends
that
they
are
willing
to
ask
us
to
pray
for
them
to
the
end
that
they
may
be
found
of
him
is
there
one
in
this
audience
who
by
rising
and
standing
for
but
a
moment
will
thus
simply
and
quietly
indicate
to
us
such
a
desire
and
willingness
who
ever
heard
of
the
first
church
pastor
doing
so
strange
a
thing
his
people
had
voted
for
festivals
and
concerts
and
lectures
and
picnics
and
entertainments
of
all
sorts
and
shades
they
had
taken
rising
votes
and
they
had
voted
by
raising
the
hand
they
had
made
speeches
many
of
them
on
the
questions
to
be
presented
they
had
added
their
voice
to
the
pastor
explanations
they
had
urged
the
wisdom
and
the
propriety
of
the
question
presented
they
had
said
they
earnestly
hoped
the
matter
would
meet
careful
attention
and
no
one
in
the
church
had
thought
such
proceedings
strange
but
to
ask
people
to
rise
in
their
seats
and
thus
signify
that
they
were
thinking
of
the
question
of
eternal
life
and
home
and
peace
and
unutterable
blessedness
what
innovation
was
this
much
rustling
and
coughing
took
place
then
solemn
silence
prevailed
not
a
deacon
there
or
officer
of
any
sort
had
the
least
idea
of
audibly
hoping
that
the
pastor
words
would
receive
thoughtful
attention
not
a
person
arose
the
silence
was
felt
to
be
embarrassing
and
oppressive
to
the
last
degree
dennis
relieved
them
at
last
by
reading
the
closing
hymn
during
the
reading
when
startled
thoughts
became
sufficiently
composed
to
flow
in
their
accustomed
channels
many
almost
unconsciously
to
themselves
prepared
speeches
which
they
meant
to
utter
the
moment
their
lips
were
unsealed
by
the
pronouncing
of
the
benediction
a
very
strange
thing
to
do
what
could
dennis
be
thinking
of
a
most
unwise
effort
to
force
the
private
lives
of
people
before
the
public
an
unfortunate
attempt
to
get
up
an
excitement
well
meant
but
most
and
mistaken
zeal
which
would
have
a
reaction
that
would
do
harm
these
and
a
dozen
other
mental
comments
that
roved
through
brains
while
they
were
supposed
to
be
joining
in
the
hymn
of
praise
were
suddenly
cut
short
by
the
sound
of
dennis
voice
again
not
in
benediction
as
surely
they
had
a
right
to
expect
by
this
time
but
with
another
appeal
i
am
still
of
the
impression
that
there
are
those
present
who
are
doing
violence
to
their
convictions
of
right
and
to
good
judgment
by
not
responding
to
my
invitation
let
us
remember
to
pray
for
all
such
now
i
want
to
ask
if
there
are
any
in
this
congregation
who
have
lately
proved
the
truth
of
the
doctrine
that
there
is
a
saviour
from
sin
and
a
peace
that
the
world
can
not
give
if
there
are
those
present
who
have
decided
this
question
recently
will
they
rise
for
a
moment
thus
testifying
to
the
truth
of
the
words
which
have
been
spoken
this
evening
and
thus
witnessing
that
they
have
chosen
the
lord
jesus
for
their
portion
another
sensation
dennis
must
have
taken
leave
of
his
senses
this
was
more
embarrassing
than
the
last
the
wise
ones
were
sure
that
there
had
been
no
conversions
in
a
long
time
so
far
as
they
knew
and
believed
entirely
other
thoughts
were
occupying
the
minds
of
the
people
then
into
the
midst
of
this
commotion
of
thought
there
stole
that
solemn
hush
almost
of
which
betokens
a
new
revelation
that
astonishes
and
thrills
and
solemnizes
there
were
persons
standing
ladies
one
two
three
yes
one
in
the
gallery
there
were
four
of
them
who
were
they
why
that
little
volatile
flossy
shipley
was
one
how
strange
and
that
girl
in
the
gallery
was
the
teacher
at
one
of
the
ward
schools
it
had
been
rumored
that
she
was
an
infidel
who
in
the
world
was
that
beside
judge
erskine
it
could
be
his
daughter
yet
it
certainly
was
and
behold
in
the
doctor
pew
stood
eurie
the
young
lady
who
was
so
free
and
careless
in
her
manners
and
address
that
were
it
not
for
the
fact
that
she
was
the
daughter
her
very
respectability
would
have
stood
a
chance
of
being
questioned
as
it
was
there
were
mothers
in
the
church
who
were
quite
willing
that
their
daughters
should
have
as
little
to
do
with
her
as
possible
yet
their
daughters
sat
beside
them
unable
to
rise
in
any
way
to
testify
to
the
truth
of
the
religion
of
jesus
christ
and
eurie
mitchell
with
grave
earnest
face
in
which
decision
and
determination
were
plainly
written
stood
up
to
testify
that
the
lord
was
true
to
his
promises
gradually
there
dawned
upon
the
minds
of
many
who
knew
these
girls
the
remembrance
that
they
had
been
together
to
that
great
meeting
at
chautauqua
how
foolish
the
scheme
had
seemed
to
them
when
they
heard
of
it
how
sneeringly
they
had
commented
on
the
absurdity
of
such
supposed
representatives
from
the
world
surely
this
seeming
folly
had
been
the
power
of
god
and
the
wisdom
of
god
there
were
those
in
the
first
church
as
indeed
there
are
many
in
every
church
of
christ
who
rejoiced
with
all
their
souls
at
the
sound
of
this
good
news
there
was
another
thing
that
occurred
that
night
over
which
the
angels
at
least
rejoiced
there
was
another
witness
he
was
only
a
poor
young
fellow
a
day
laborer
in
one
of
the
machine
shops
a
to
the
city
he
knew
almost
nobody
in
that
great
church
where
he
had
chanced
to
be
a
worshipper
and
literally
no
one
knew
him
when
the
invitation
was
first
given
he
had
shrunken
from
it
satan
with
skill
and
with
that
consummate
wisdom
which
makes
him
as
eager
after
the
common
day
laborers
as
he
is
among
the
wealthy
and
influential
had
whispered
to
him
that
the
pastor
did
not
mean
such
as
he
no
one
knew
him
his
influence
would
be
nothing
this
church
was
too
large
and
too
grand
and
it
was
not
meant
that
he
should
make
himself
so
conspicuous
as
to
stand
alone
in
that
great
and
testify
that
the
lord
jesus
had
called
him
so
he
sat
still
but
as
one
and
another
of
those
young
ladies
arose
quietly
with
true
dignity
and
sweet
composure
testifying
to
their
love
for
the
lord
john
warden
earnest
soul
was
moved
to
shame
at
his
own
shrinking
and
from
his
obscure
seat
back
under
the
gallery
he
rose
up
and
satan
foiled
that
time
shrunk
away
as
for
our
girls
they
held
no
parley
with
their
consciences
or
with
the
tempter
they
did
not
even
think
of
it
on
the
contrary
they
were
glad
every
one
that
the
way
was
made
so
plain
and
so
easy
to
them
each
of
them
had
friends
whom
they
especially
desired
to
have
know
of
the
recent
and
great
change
that
had
come
to
their
lives
with
some
of
these
friends
they
shrank
unaccountably
from
talking
about
this
matter
with
others
of
them
they
did
not
understand
how
to
made
the
matter
plain
but
here
it
was
explained
for
them
so
plainly
so
simply
that
it
seemed
that
every
one
must
understand
and
their
own
future
determination
as
to
life
was
carefully
explained
for
them
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
rise
up
and
by
that
simple
act
subscribe
their
names
to
the
explanation
so
making
it
theirs
i
declare
to
you
that
the
thought
of
its
being
a
cross
to
do
so
did
not
once
occur
to
them
neither
did
the
thought
that
they
were
occupying
a
conspicuous
position
affect
them
they
were
used
to
conspicuous
positions
they
had
been
twice
as
prominent
in
that
very
church
when
other
subjects
than
religion
had
been
under
consideration
at
a
certain
festival
years
before
they
had
every
one
taken
part
in
a
musical
entertainment
that
brought
them
most
conspicuously
before
an
audience
three
times
the
size
of
the
evening
congregation
so
you
see
they
were
used
to
it
and
as
for
the
fancy
that
it
becomes
a
more
conspicuous
and
unladylike
matter
to
stand
up
for
the
lord
jesus
christ
than
it
does
to
stand
up
for
anything
else
under
the
sun
satan
was
much
too
wise
and
knew
his
material
entirely
too
well
to
suggest
any
such
absurdity
to
them
flossy
had
been
the
only
one
of
their
number
in
the
least
likely
to
be
swayed
by
such
arguments
but
flossy
had
set
herself
with
earnest
soul
and
solemn
purpose
to
follow
the
light
wherever
it
should
shine
without
allowing
her
timid
heart
time
for
questioning
and
the
father
of
all
evil
finds
such
people
exceedingly
hard
to
manage
how
do
you
do
said
dennis
to
john
warden
two
minutes
after
the
benediction
was
fully
pronounced
i
was
very
glad
to
see
you
i
am
not
sure
that
i
have
ever
met
you
no
i
thought
so
a
stranger
well
we
welcome
you
where
do
you
board
and
a
certain
black
book
came
promptly
out
of
the
doctor
pocket
john
warden
name
and
street
and
number
and
business
were
written
therein
and
john
warden
felt
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
as
though
he
had
a
christian
brother
in
that
great
city
and
a
name
and
a
place
with
the
people
of
god
another
surprise
a
waited
him
marion
and
eurie
were
right
behind
him
marion
came
up
boldly
and
held
out
her
hand
we
seem
to
have
started
on
the
road
together
she
said
we
ought
to
shake
hands
and
wish
each
other
a
safe
journey
then
she
and
eurie
and
john
warden
shook
each
other
heartily
by
the
hand
and
flossy
standing
watching
led
by
this
bolder
spirit
into
that
which
would
not
have
occurred
to
her
to
do
slipped
from
her
place
beside
baker
and
holding
her
lavender
kidded
little
hand
out
to
his
broad
brown
palm
said
with
a
grace
and
a
sweetness
that
belonged
to
neither
of
the
others
i
am
one
of
them
whereupon
john
warden
was
not
sure
that
he
had
not
shaken
hands
with
an
angel
illustration
chapter
x
the
rainy
evening
a
cool
rainy
evening
one
of
those
sudden
and
sharp
reminders
of
autumn
that
in
our
variable
climate
come
to
us
in
the
midst
of
summer
the
heavy
clouds
had
made
the
day
shut
down
early
and
the
rain
was
so
persistent
that
it
was
useless
to
plan
walks
or
rides
or
entertainments
of
that
nature
also
it
was
an
evening
when
none
but
those
who
are
habitual
callers
at
special
homes
are
expected
one
of
these
was
baker
the
idea
of
being
detained
by
rain
from
spending
the
evening
with
flossy
shipley
did
not
occur
to
him
on
the
contrary
he
rejoiced
over
the
prospect
of
a
long
and
uninterrupted
talk
the
more
indifferent
flossy
grew
to
these
long
talks
the
more
eager
was
baker
to
enjoy
them
the
further
she
slipped
away
from
him
the
more
eagerly
he
followed
after
perhaps
that
is
human
nature
at
least
it
was
baker
nature
in
some
of
his
plans
he
was
disappointed
shipley
was
gone
for
a
three
days
visit
to
a
neighboring
city
and
flossy
was
snugly
settled
in
the
back
parlor
entertaining
her
father
show
him
right
in
here
directed
her
father
as
soon
as
baker
was
announced
then
to
flossy
now
we
can
have
a
game
at
cards
as
soon
as
charlie
comes
in
where
is
he
rainy
evenings
when
four
people
could
be
secured
sufficiently
disengaged
to
join
in
his
favorite
amusement
was
the
special
delight
of
shipley
so
behold
them
half
an
hour
after
deep
in
a
game
of
cards
baker
accepting
the
situation
with
as
good
a
grace
as
he
could
assume
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
playing
cards
simply
for
amusement
in
that
quiet
way
in
a
back
parlor
was
a
good
deal
of
a
bore
to
him
but
it
would
be
bad
policy
to
tell
shipley
so
their
game
was
interrupted
by
a
ring
of
the
oh
dear
said
shipley
i
hope
that
is
no
nuisance
on
business
one
would
think
nothing
but
business
would
call
people
out
on
such
a
disagreeable
night
as
for
instance
myself
baker
said
laughingly
oh
you
of
course
special
friends
are
an
exception
and
baker
was
well
pleased
to
be
ranked
among
the
exceptions
meantime
the
ringer
was
heralded
it
is
dennis
sir
shall
i
show
him
in
here
i
suppose
so
shipley
said
gloomily
as
one
not
well
pleased
and
he
added
in
under
tone
what
on
earth
can
the
man
want
meantime
baker
with
a
sudden
dexterous
move
unceremoniously
swept
the
whole
pack
of
cards
out
of
sight
under
a
paper
by
his
side
it
so
happened
that
dennis
call
was
purely
one
of
business
some
item
connected
with
the
financial
portion
of
the
church
which
dennis
desired
to
report
in
a
special
sermon
that
was
being
prepared
shipley
although
he
was
so
rarely
an
attendant
at
church
and
made
no
secret
of
his
indifference
to
the
whole
subject
of
personal
religion
was
yet
a
power
in
the
financial
world
and
as
such
recognized
and
deferred
to
by
the
first
church
dennis
was
in
haste
and
beyond
a
specially
cordial
greeting
for
flossy
and
an
expression
of
satisfaction
at
her
success
with
the
class
the
previous
sabbath
he
had
no
more
to
say
and
shipley
soon
had
the
pleasure
of
bowing
him
out
rejoicing
in
his
heart
as
he
did
so
that
the
clergyman
was
so
prompt
a
man
he
would
have
made
a
capital
business
man
he
said
returning
to
his
seat
i
never
come
in
contact
with
him
that
i
do
notice
a
sort
of
executive
ability
about
him
that
makes
me
think
what
a
success
he
might
have
been
there
was
no
one
to
ask
whether
that
remark
meant
that
he
was
at
present
supposed
to
be
a
failure
there
was
another
subject
which
presently
engrossed
several
of
them
now
be
so
kind
as
to
give
an
account
of
yourself
charlie
shipley
said
addressing
baker
what
on
earth
did
you
mean
by
making
a
muddle
of
our
game
in
that
way
i
was
in
a
fair
way
for
winning
i
suppose
you
wo
own
that
that
was
your
object
baker
laughed
my
object
was
a
purely
benevolent
one
i
had
a
desire
to
shield
your
sister
from
the
woebegone
lecture
she
would
have
been
sure
to
receive
on
the
sinfulness
of
her
course
if
he
had
found
her
playing
cards
what
would
have
been
the
result
shipley
was
the
first
to
make
answer
in
a
somewhat
testy
tone
your
generosity
was
uncalled
for
colonel
my
daughter
when
she
is
in
her
father
house
is
answerable
to
him
and
not
to
dennis
or
any
other
divine
i
do
in
the
least
understand
what
you
are
talking
about
said
mystified
flossy
of
what
interest
could
it
have
been
to
dennis
what
i
am
doing
and
why
should
he
have
delivered
a
lecture
baker
and
charlie
shipley
exchanged
amused
glances
and
the
former
quoted
significantly
where
ignorance
is
bliss
is
folly
to
be
wise
then
he
added
as
flossy
still
waited
with
questioning
gaze
why
miss
flossy
of
course
you
know
that
the
clergy
think
cards
are
synonyms
for
the
deadly
sin
and
that
to
hold
one
in
one
hand
is
equivalent
to
being
poisoned
body
and
soul
i
am
sure
i
did
not
know
it
why
i
knew
of
course
that
gambling
houses
were
not
proper
but
what
is
the
harm
in
a
game
of
cards
what
can
dennis
see
for
instance
in
our
playing
together
here
in
this
room
and
simply
for
amusement
baker
shrugged
his
handsome
shoulders
that
shrug
meant
a
great
deal
accomplished
a
great
deal
it
was
nearly
certain
to
silence
a
timid
opposer
there
was
something
so
expressively
sarcastic
about
it
it
hid
so
much
one
felt
sure
baker
if
he
deemed
it
prudent
or
worth
while
it
had
often
silenced
flossy
into
a
conscious
little
laugh
she
was
in
earnest
she
paid
no
attention
to
the
shrug
but
waited
questioningly
for
her
answer
and
as
it
was
her
turn
to
play
next
it
seemed
necessary
to
answer
her
if
one
wanted
the
game
to
go
on
i
am
sure
i
do
know
baker
said
at
last
i
have
very
little
idea
what
he
would
consider
the
harm
i
am
not
sure
that
would
be
able
to
tell
it
is
probably
a
narrow
way
that
the
cloth
have
of
looking
at
this
question
in
common
with
all
other
questions
save
and
almsgiving
their
lives
are
very
much
narrowed
down
miss
flossy
flossy
was
entirely
unsatisfied
she
had
a
higher
opinion
of
breadth
than
she
had
of
baker
she
thought
his
life
had
a
very
much
higher
range
she
was
very
much
puzzled
and
annoyed
her
father
came
into
the
conflict
come
come
flossy
how
long
are
you
going
to
keep
us
waiting
it
is
of
no
particular
consequence
what
dennis
thinks
or
does
not
think
he
has
a
right
to
his
own
opinions
it
is
a
free
country
ah
but
it
did
make
a
tremendous
difference
to
flossy
she
had
accepted
dennis
as
her
pastor
she
had
determined
to
look
to
him
for
help
and
guidance
in
this
new
and
strange
path
on
which
her
feet
had
so
lately
entered
she
wondered
if
baker
could
be
right
was
it
possible
that
dennis
disapproved
of
cards
played
at
home
in
this
quiet
way
if
he
did
why
did
he
and
another
puzzling
point
how
did
baker
know
it
they
two
certainly
did
not
come
in
contact
that
they
should
understand
each
other
ideas
she
went
on
with
her
but
she
played
very
badly
more
than
once
baker
rallied
her
with
sarcasm
and
her
father
spoke
impatiently
flossy
interest
in
the
game
was
gone
instead
her
heart
was
busy
with
this
new
idea
she
went
back
to
it
again
in
one
of
her
pauses
in
the
game
baker
do
you
really
know
at
all
what
arguments
clergymen
have
against
for
amusement
again
that
expressive
shrug
but
it
had
lost
its
power
over
flossy
and
its
owner
saw
it
and
made
haste
to
answer
her
waiting
eyes
i
really
am
not
familiar
with
their
weapons
of
warfare
probably
i
could
not
appreciate
them
if
i
were
i
only
know
that
the
entire
class
frown
upon
all
such
innocent
devices
for
passing
a
rainy
evening
but
it
never
struck
me
as
strange
because
the
fact
is
they
frown
equally
on
all
pastimes
and
entertainments
of
any
sort
that
is
a
certain
class
do
fanatics
i
believe
is
the
name
they
are
known
by
they
believe
as
nearly
as
i
am
capable
of
understanding
their
belief
that
life
should
be
spent
in
and
praying
whereupon
flossy
called
to
mind
the
witty
things
she
had
heard
and
the
merry
laughs
which
had
rung
around
her
at
chautauqua
given
by
the
most
intense
of
these
fanatics
she
even
remembered
that
she
had
seen
two
of
the
most
celebrated
in
that
direction
playing
with
a
party
of
young
men
and
boys
on
the
croquet
ground
and
laughing
most
uproariously
over
their
defeat
it
was
all
nonsense
to
try
to
compass
her
brain
with
such
an
argument
as
that
she
shook
her
head
resolutely
they
do
no
such
thing
i
know
some
of
them
very
well
i
do
know
of
any
people
who
have
nicer
times
how
do
you
know
these
things
col
baker
baker
essayed
to
be
serious
miss
flossy
he
said
leaning
over
and
fixing
his
handsome
eyes
impressively
on
her
face
is
it
possible
you
do
not
know
that
as
a
rule
clergymen
set
their
faces
like
a
flint
against
all
amusements
of
every
sort
i
do
not
mean
that
there
are
not
exceptions
but
i
do
mean
most
assuredly
that
dennis
is
not
one
of
them
he
is
as
rigid
as
it
is
possible
for
mortal
man
to
be
herein
is
where
the
church
does
harm
in
my
own
opinion
it
is
to
blame
for
the
most
if
not
for
all
of
the
excesses
of
the
day
they
are
the
natural
rebound
of
nerves
that
have
been
strained
too
tightly
by
the
of
the
church
surely
this
was
a
fine
sentence
the
flossy
of
a
few
weeks
ago
would
have
admired
the
words
and
the
exquisitely
modulated
voice
as
it
rolled
them
forth
how
had
the
present
flossy
been
quickened
as
to
her
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
she
laughed
mischievously
she
could
argue
she
did
not
attempt
it
all
she
said
was
simply
baker
on
your
honor
as
a
gentleman
of
truth
and
veracity
do
you
think
the
excesses
of
which
you
speak
occur
as
a
rule
in
those
whose
lives
have
been
very
tightly
bound
by
the
church
or
by
anything
else
save
their
own
reckless
fancies
charlie
shipley
laughed
outright
at
this
point
he
always
enjoyed
a
sharp
thing
wherever
heard
and
without
regard
to
whether
he
felt
himself
thrust
at
or
not
baker
you
are
getting
the
worst
of
it
he
said
gayly
sis
upon
my
word
that
two
weeks
in
the
woods
has
made
you
real
keen
in
argument
but
you
play
abominably
there
is
no
pleasure
in
the
game
now
this
the
father
said
throwing
down
his
cards
somewhat
testily
flossy
i
hope
you
will
not
get
to
be
a
girl
of
one
idea
tied
to
the
professional
conscience
what
is
proper
for
you
could
hardly
be
expected
to
be
just
the
thing
for
dennis
and
you
have
nothing
to
do
as
i
said
before
with
what
he
approves
or
disapproves
but
father
flossy
said
speaking
somewhat
timidly
as
she
could
not
help
doing
when
she
talked
about
these
matters
to
her
father
if
we
call
clergymen
our
spiritual
guides
and
look
up
to
them
to
set
examples
for
us
to
follow
what
is
the
use
of
the
example
if
we
do
follow
it
at
all
but
conclude
they
are
simply
doing
things
for
their
own
benefit
i
never
call
them
my
spiritual
guides
and
i
have
not
the
least
desire
to
have
my
daughter
do
so
i
consider
myself
capable
of
guiding
my
own
family
especially
my
own
children
without
any
help
this
was
said
in
shipley
stiffest
tone
he
was
evidently
very
much
tried
with
this
interruption
to
his
evening
entertainment
whatever
might
be
said
of
the
others
he
was
certainly
very
fond
of
cards
he
however
threw
down
the
remaining
ones
declaring
that
the
spirit
of
the
game
was
gone
merged
into
a
theological
discussion
charlie
said
with
a
half
laugh
half
sneer
and
of
all
the
people
to
indulge
in
one
this
particular
circle
would
be
supposed
to
be
the
last
well
i
am
certainly
very
sorry
that
i
was
the
innocent
cause
of
such
an
upheaval
baker
said
in
the
half
serious
half
mocking
tone
that
was
becoming
especially
trying
to
flossy
it
seems
that
i
unwittingly
burst
a
bombshell
when
i
overturned
those
cards
i
an
idea
of
it
miss
flossy
what
can
i
do
to
atone
for
making
you
so
uneasy
i
assure
you
it
was
really
pure
benevolence
on
my
part
what
can
i
do
to
prove
it
nothing
flossy
said
smiling
pleasantly
she
was
very
much
obliged
he
had
awakened
thought
about
a
matter
that
had
never
before
occurred
to
her
she
began
to
think
there
were
a
good
many
things
in
her
life
that
had
not
been
given
very
much
thought
she
meant
to
look
into
this
thing
and
understand
it
if
she
could
indeed
that
was
what
she
wanted
of
all
things
to
do
nothing
could
be
simpler
and
sweeter
and
nothing
could
be
more
unlike
the
flossy
of
baker
former
acquaintance
i
should
wonder
a
bit
if
you
had
roused
a
hornet
nest
about
your
ears
charlie
shipley
said
to
his
friend
now
i
tell
you
you
may
not
believe
it
but
my
little
sister
is
just
exactly
the
stuff
out
of
which
they
made
martyrs
in
those
unenlightened
days
when
anybody
thought
there
was
enough
truth
in
anything
to
take
the
trouble
to
suffer
for
it
she
can
be
made
by
skillful
handling
into
a
very
queen
of
martyrs
and
if
you
fall
in
the
ruins
it
will
be
your
own
fault
but
he
did
not
say
this
until
flossy
had
suddenly
and
unceremoniously
excused
herself
and
the
two
gentlemen
were
alone
over
their
cigars
confound
that
chautauqua
scheme
baker
said
kicking
an
innocent
hassock
half
across
the
room
with
his
indignant
foot
that
is
where
all
these
new
ideas
started
i
wish
there
was
a
law
against
fanaticism
those
young
women
of
strong
mind
and
disagreeable
manners
are
getting
a
most
uncomfortable
influence
over
her
too
if
i
were
you
charlie
i
would
try
to
put
an
end
to
that
intimacy
charlie
whistled
softly
which
do
you
mean
he
asked
at
last
the
erskine
girl
or
the
wilbur
one
i
tell
you
baker
with
all
the
years
of
your
acquaintance
you
do
know
that
little
flossy
as
well
as
you
think
you
do
let
me
tell
you
my
man
there
is
something
about
her
or
in
her
that
is
capable
of
development
and
that
is
being
developed
or
i
am
mistaken
that
will
make
her
the
leader
in
a
quiet
way
of
a
dozen
decided
and
outspoken
girls
like
those
two
and
of
several
men
like
yourself
besides
if
she
chooses
to
lead
you
well
confound
the
development
then
i
liked
her
better
as
she
was
before
more
congenial
i
admit
at
least
i
should
think
so
but
not
half
so
interesting
to
watch
i
have
real
good
times
now
i
am
continually
wondering
what
she
will
do
next
illustration
illustration
chapter
xi
the
next
thing
what
she
did
next
that
night
was
to
sit
with
her
elbows
in
her
lap
and
her
chin
resting
on
her
hands
and
stare
into
vacancy
for
half
an
hour
she
was
very
much
bewildered
baker
had
awakened
a
train
of
thought
that
would
never
slumber
again
he
need
not
hope
for
such
a
thing
her
brother
charlie
saw
deeper
into
her
nature
than
she
did
herself
she
was
tenacious
of
an
idea
she
had
grasped
at
this
one
which
of
itself
would
perhaps
never
have
occurred
to
her
hitherto
she
had
played
at
cards
as
she
had
played
on
the
piano
or
worked
at
her
worsted
cats
and
dogs
or
frittered
away
an
evening
in
the
smallest
of
small
talk
or
done
a
hundred
other
things
without
thought
of
results
without
so
much
as
realizing
that
there
were
such
things
as
results
connected
with
such
trifling
commonplaces
at
least
so
far
as
the
matter
of
cards
was
concerned
she
would
never
do
so
again
her
quiet
had
been
disturbed
the
process
of
reasoning
by
which
she
found
herself
disturbed
was
very
simple
she
had
discovered
as
if
by
accident
that
her
pastor
as
she
loved
to
call
dennis
lingering
on
the
word
now
that
it
had
such
a
new
meaning
for
her
disapproved
of
not
only
for
himself
but
for
her
at
least
that
baker
so
supposed
now
there
must
be
some
foundation
for
this
belief
of
his
either
there
was
something
in
the
nature
of
the
game
which
baker
recognized
and
which
she
did
not
that
made
him
understand
as
by
instinct
that
it
would
be
disapproved
by
dennis
or
else
he
had
heard
him
so
express
himself
or
else
he
was
totally
mistaken
and
was
misrepresenting
that
gentleman
character
she
thought
all
this
over
as
she
sat
staring
into
space
and
she
went
one
step
further
she
meant
to
discover
which
of
these
three
statements
was
correct
if
dennis
thought
it
wrong
to
play
cards
then
he
must
have
reasons
for
so
thinking
she
accepted
that
at
once
as
a
necessity
to
the
man
they
must
also
have
been
carefully
weighed
reasons
else
he
would
not
have
given
them
a
place
in
his
creed
this
also
was
a
necessity
to
a
nature
like
his
clearly
there
was
something
here
for
her
to
study
but
how
to
set
about
it
over
this
she
puzzled
a
good
deal
she
did
not
like
to
go
directly
to
dennis
and
ask
for
herself
she
did
not
know
how
to
set
to
work
to
discover
for
herself
the
truth
she
could
pray
for
light
that
to
be
sure
but
having
brought
her
common
sense
with
her
into
religious
matters
she
no
more
expected
light
to
blaze
upon
her
at
the
moment
of
praying
for
it
than
she
expected
the
sun
to
burst
into
the
room
despite
the
closing
of
blinds
and
dropping
of
curtain
merely
because
she
prayed
that
it
might
shine
clearly
if
she
wanted
the
sun
it
was
her
part
to
open
blinds
and
draw
back
curtains
clearly
if
she
wanted
mental
light
it
was
her
part
to
use
the
means
that
god
had
placed
at
her
disposal
thus
much
she
realized
but
not
being
a
girl
it
resulted
in
her
saying
to
eurie
mitchell
when
she
slipped
in
the
next
evening
to
spend
an
hour
i
wish
we
girls
could
get
together
somewhere
this
evening
i
have
something
to
talk
over
that
puzzles
me
a
great
deal
you
are
to
understand
that
the
expression
we
girls
meant
the
four
who
had
lived
chautauqua
together
from
henceforth
and
forever
we
girls
who
went
through
the
varied
experiences
of
life
together
that
were
crowded
into
those
two
weeks
would
be
separated
from
all
other
girls
and
their
intercourse
would
necessarily
be
different
from
any
other
friendships
colored
always
with
that
which
they
had
lived
together
under
the
trees
well
said
eurie
quick
as
usual
to
carry
out
what
another
only
suggested
i
sure
that
is
easily
managed
we
can
call
for
ruth
and
go
around
to
marion
den
she
is
always
in
and
she
never
has
any
company
but
ruth
nearly
always
has
objected
flossy
who
had
an
instant
vision
of
herself
among
the
fashionable
callers
in
the
erskine
parlor
unable
to
get
away
without
absolute
rudeness
i
risk
ruth
if
she
happens
to
want
to
come
with
us
eurie
said
nodding
her
head
sagely
she
will
dispose
of
her
callers
in
some
way
strangle
them
or
what
is
easier
and
safer
simply
ignore
their
existence
and
beg
to
be
excused
ruth
is
equal
to
any
amount
of
rudeness
all
that
is
necessary
is
the
desire
to
perform
a
certain
action
and
she
will
do
it
this
prophecy
of
eurie
proved
to
be
the
case
nellis
mitchell
was
called
into
service
to
see
the
girls
safely
over
to
the
erskine
mansion
where
they
found
two
gentlemen
calling
on
ruth
and
her
father
no
sooner
did
she
hear
of
their
desire
to
be
together
than
feeling
instant
sympathy
with
it
she
said
i
go
in
five
minutes
then
they
heard
her
quiet
voice
in
the
parlor
father
will
you
and
our
friends
excuse
me
for
the
remainder
of
the
evening
and
will
you
enjoy
my
part
of
the
call
and
yours
too
i
have
just
had
a
summons
elsewhere
that
demands
attention
is
that
perfect
in
its
propriety
besides
bringing
things
to
the
exact
point
where
she
wants
them
to
be
whispered
eurie
to
flossy
as
they
waited
in
the
hall
oh
it
takes
ruth
to
manage
i
wonder
said
flossy
with
her
look
and
curve
of
the
lip
i
wonder
if
it
is
strictly
that
is
what
troubles
me
a
good
deal
oh
hurlbut
your
address
to
the
children
that
summer
day
under
the
trees
was
the
germ
of
this
shoot
of
sensitiveness
for
the
strict
truth
that
shall
bloom
into
conscientious
fruit
it
was
by
this
process
that
they
were
all
together
in
marion
den
as
eurie
called
her
stuffed
and
uninviting
little
room
never
was
mortal
more
glad
to
be
interrupted
than
she
as
she
unceremoniously
tossed
aside
and
papers
and
made
room
for
them
around
the
table
you
are
a
blessed
trio
she
said
exultantly
what
good
angel
put
it
into
your
hearts
to
come
to
me
just
now
and
here
i
am
in
the
dismals
have
been
down
all
day
in
the
depths
of
feeling
as
if
i
had
a
friend
on
earth
and
did
want
one
and
here
you
are
you
blessed
three
but
we
did
come
for
fun
or
to
comfort
you
or
anything
of
that
sort
explained
flossy
earnestly
true
to
the
purpose
that
had
started
her
we
came
to
talk
something
over
i
do
doubt
it
talk
it
over
then
by
all
means
i
talk
at
it
with
all
my
heart
we
generally
do
talk
something
over
i
have
observed
when
we
get
together
at
least
we
do
of
late
years
which
one
wants
to
talk
thus
introduced
flossy
explained
the
nature
of
her
perplexities
her
occupation
the
evening
before
the
interruption
from
dennis
the
sweeping
action
of
baker
and
the
consequent
talk
now
do
you
suppose
that
is
true
she
said
suddenly
breaking
off
at
the
point
where
baker
had
assured
her
that
all
clergymen
looked
with
utter
disfavor
on
cards
marion
glanced
from
one
to
another
of
the
faces
before
her
with
an
amused
air
none
of
them
spoke
it
is
rather
queer
she
said
at
last
that
i
have
to
be
authority
or
that
i
seem
to
be
the
only
one
posted
when
i
have
but
just
emerged
from
a
state
of
unbelief
in
the
whole
subject
but
i
tell
you
truly
my
blessed
little
innocent
baker
is
well
posted
not
only
the
clergy
but
he
will
find
a
large
class
of
the
most
enlightened
christians
look
with
disapproval
on
the
whole
thing
in
all
its
variations
why
do
they
this
from
flossy
with
a
perplexed
and
troubled
tone
well
said
marion
now
that
question
is
more
easily
asked
than
answered
it
requires
an
argument
an
argument
is
just
what
i
want
i
like
to
have
things
explained
before
that
though
one
thing
that
puzzles
me
is
how
should
baker
be
so
familiar
with
the
views
of
clergymen
that
is
a
curious
fact
my
mousie
you
will
find
it
i
fancy
in
all
sorts
of
strange
places
people
who
are
not
christians
seem
to
have
an
intuitive
perception
of
the
fitness
of
things
it
is
like
dancing
and
and
a
dozen
other
questions
it
is
very
unusual
to
meet
people
who
do
not
sneer
at
christians
for
upholding
such
amusements
they
seem
to
realize
an
incongruity
between
them
and
the
christian
profession
it
was
just
as
plain
to
me
i
know
and
i
have
sneered
many
a
time
over
christians
and
here
you
are
dear
little
flossy
among
them
just
for
the
purpose
of
teaching
me
not
to
judge
ruth
for
the
first
time
took
up
the
subject
if
your
statement
is
true
marion
how
is
it
that
so
many
professed
christians
indulge
in
these
very
things
precisely
the
question
that
i
just
asked
myself
while
i
was
talking
by
what
means
they
become
destitute
of
that
keen
insight
into
consistencies
and
inconsistencies
the
moment
they
enter
the
lists
as
christian
people
is
more
than
i
can
understand
unless
it
is
because
they
decide
to
succumb
to
the
necessity
of
doing
as
other
people
do
and
let
any
special
thinking
alone
as
inconvenient
and
unprofitable
i
do
know
how
it
is
only
you
watch
this
question
and
think
about
it
and
you
will
discover
that
just
so
surely
as
you
come
in
contact
with
any
who
are
active
and
alert
in
christian
work
whose
religion
you
respect
as
amounting
to
something
you
are
almost
sure
to
see
them
avoiding
all
these
amusements
who
ever
heard
of
a
minister
being
asked
to
spend
an
evening
in
social
i
presume
that
even
baker
himself
knows
that
that
would
be
improper
and
he
would
be
the
first
to
sneer
of
course
ruth
said
ministers
were
expected
to
be
examples
for
other
people
to
follow
well
then
flossy
said
her
perplexity
in
no
way
lessened
ought
we
not
to
follow
whereupon
marion
clapped
her
hands
little
flossy
among
the
logicians
she
said
that
is
the
point
ruth
erskine
if
the
example
is
for
us
to
follow
why
do
we
follow
now
what
do
you
honestly
think
about
this
question
yourself
why
said
ruth
hesitatingly
i
have
always
played
cards
in
select
circles
being
careful
of
course
with
whom
i
played
just
as
i
am
careful
with
whom
i
associate
and
contrary
to
your
supposition
i
have
always
supposed
those
people
who
frowned
on
such
amusements
to
be
a
set
of
fanatics
and
i
did
know
that
christian
people
did
frown
on
such
amusements
though
to
be
sure
now
that
i
think
of
it
there
are
certain
ones
who
never
come
to
nor
i
guess
the
difficulty
is
that
i
have
never
thought
anything
about
it
marion
was
looking
sober
the
fact
is
she
said
gravely
that
with
all
my
loneliness
and
poverty
and
general
forlornness
i
have
had
a
different
bringing
up
from
any
of
you
my
father
did
not
believe
in
any
of
these
things
and
he
was
a
christian
man
flossy
said
quickly
then
he
must
have
had
a
reason
for
his
belief
that
is
what
i
want
to
get
at
what
was
it
he
found
it
in
an
old
book
said
marion
looking
at
her
brightly
through
shining
eyes
he
found
most
of
his
knowledge
and
his
hope
and
joy
in
that
same
book
the
bible
was
almost
the
only
book
he
had
and
he
made
much
of
that
and
yet
you
hated
the
bible
eurie
said
this
almost
involuntarily
with
a
surprised
tone
i
hated
the
way
in
which
people
lived
it
so
different
from
my
way
i
do
think
i
ever
really
discarded
the
book
itself
but
i
was
a
fool
i
do
mind
owning
that
flossy
brought
them
back
to
the
subject
but
about
this
question
she
said
the
bible
was
just
where
i
went
for
help
but
i
did
find
it
i
looked
in
the
concordance
for
cards
and
for
amusements
and
for
every
word
which
i
could
think
of
that
would
cover
it
but
i
could
find
anything
marion
laughed
again
this
little
morsel
ignorance
of
the
bible
was
to
this
girl
who
had
been
an
avowed
infidel
for
more
than
a
dozen
years
something
very
strange
the
bible
is
a
big
book
darling
she
said
still
laughing
but
after
all
i
fancy
you
will
find
something
about
the
principle
that
governs
cards
even
if
you
can
not
find
the
word
meantime
ruth
had
been
for
some
minutes
regarding
eurie
grave
face
and
attentive
eyes
with
no
small
astonishment
in
her
gaze
at
this
point
she
interrupted
eurie
mitchell
what
can
be
the
matter
with
you
were
you
ever
known
to
be
so
quiet
i
have
heard
you
speak
on
this
theme
or
any
other
since
you
came
into
the
room
yet
you
look
as
though
you
had
some
ideas
if
you
chose
to
advance
them
where
do
you
stand
on
this
card
question
we
never
play
cards
at
home
eurie
said
quickly
and
we
never
go
where
we
know
they
are
to
be
played
flossy
turned
upon
her
the
most
surprised
eyes
mitchell
family
was
the
most
decidedly
unconventional
and
free
and
easy
of
any
represented
there
flossy
had
supposed
that
they
of
all
others
would
make
cards
a
daily
pastime
why
not
she
asked
briefly
and
earnestly
as
one
eager
to
learn
it
is
on
nell
account
eurie
said
still
speaking
very
gravely
nell
has
but
one
fault
and
that
is
he
is
just
passionately
fond
of
it
he
is
tempted
everywhere
father
says
grandfather
mitchell
was
just
so
and
nell
inherits
the
taste
it
is
a
great
temptation
to
him
and
we
do
not
like
to
foster
it
at
home
but
home
is
so
different
that
is
gambling
this
from
flossy
questioningly
nell
learned
to
play
at
home
eurie
said
quickly
that
is
he
learned
at
grandfather
mitchell
when
he
was
a
little
boy
we
have
no
means
of
knowing
whether
he
would
have
been
led
into
gambling
but
for
that
early
education
i
know
that
robbie
shall
never
learn
if
we
can
help
it
we
never
mean
to
allow
him
to
go
where
any
sort
of
cards
are
played
so
long
as
we
have
him
under
control
all
this
was
utterly
new
to
flossy
then
if
your
little
robbie
should
come
with
other
children
to
see
me
and
i
should
teach
them
a
game
of
cards
to
amuse
them
i
might
be
doing
you
a
positive
injury
she
said
thoughtfully
i
certainly
should
so
consider
it
eurie
said
with
quickness
and
with
feeling
girls
i
speak
vehemently
on
this
subject
always
having
one
serious
lesson
at
home
makes
people
think
it
is
a
question
whether
we
have
any
right
to
indulge
in
an
amusement
that
has
the
power
to
lead
people
astray
ruth
said
grave
and
thoughtful
especially
when
it
is
impossible
to
tell
what
boy
may
he
growing
up
under
that
influence
to
whom
it
will
become
a
snare
marion
added
flossy
do
you
begin
to
see
i
see
in
every
direction
flossy
said
there
is
no
telling
when
we
may
be
doing
harm
but
now
let
me
be
personal
i
play
with
father
a
great
deal
he
is
an
old
man
and
he
has
no
special
temptation
certainly
i
have
heard
him
say
he
never
played
for
anything
of
more
value
than
a
pin
in
his
life
what
harm
can
there
possibly
be
in
my
spending
an
evening
with
him
in
such
an
amusement
if
it
rests
and
entertains
him
imagine
some
of
your
boys
accepting
your
invitation
to
call
on
you
and
finding
you
playing
a
social
game
with
your
father
then
imagine
them
quoting
you
in
support
of
their
game
at
the
billiard
saloon
that
same
evening
a
little
later
marion
said
quickly
you
see
my
little
flossy
we
do
live
in
nutshells
or
sealed
cans
we
are
at
all
times
liable
to
be
broken
in
upon
by
people
whom
we
may
influence
and
whom
we
may
harm
i
confess
i
do
want
to
do
anything
at
home
that
will
have
to
be
pushed
out
of
sight
in
haste
and
confusion
because
some
one
happens
to
come
in
i
want
to
be
honest
even
in
my
play
over
this
flossy
looked
absolutely
aghast
those
boys
of
hers
they
were
getting
a
strong
hold
upon
her
already
she
longed
to
lead
them
was
it
possible
that
by
her
very
amusements
she
might
lead
them
astray
another
point
was
that
nellis
mitchell
could
never
be
invited
to
join
them
in
a
game
she
had
invited
him
often
and
she
winced
at
the
thought
did
his
sister
think
she
had
helped
him
into
temptation
following
these
trains
of
thought
she
was
led
into
another
over
which
she
thought
aloud
and
suppose
any
of
them
should
ask
me
if
i
ever
played
cards
i
should
have
to
say
yes
precisely
said
marion
and
do
you
go
to
thinking
that
you
can
ever
hide
behind
that
foolish
little
explanation
play
simply
for
amusement
i
think
it
is
wrong
to
play
for
money
it
wo
do
it
takes
logical
brains
to
see
the
difference
and
some
even
of
those
see
it
but
they
can
readily
see
that
having
plenty
of
money
of
course
you
have
no
temptation
to
play
cards
for
it
and
they
see
that
with
them
it
is
different

chapter
xii
settling
questions
there
is
bible
for
that
doctrine
too
where
flossy
asked
turning
quickly
to
marion
in
this
verse
meat
maketh
my
brother
to
offend
i
will
eat
no
meat
while
the
world
stands
do
you
see
you
never
can
know
which
brother
may
be
made
to
offend
and
it
is
even
about
so
useful
a
thing
as
food
said
flossy
looking
her
amazement
she
had
never
heard
that
verse
before
in
her
life
about
just
that
thing
and
nothing
so
really
unnecessary
to
a
complete
life
as
may
be
baker
sneers
at
the
inconsistency
of
people
who
have
nothing
to
do
with
cards
and
who
play
croquet
eurie
said
this
with
cheeks
a
little
heightened
in
color
she
had
come
in
contact
with
baker
on
this
very
question
ruth
looked
up
quickly
from
the
paper
on
which
she
was
scribbling
i
think
myself
she
said
that
if
it
should
seem
necessary
to
me
to
give
up
cards
entirely
consistency
would
oblige
me
to
include
croquet
and
all
other
games
of
that
sort
i
should
feel
obliged
to
do
any
such
thing
marion
said
promptly
at
least
not
until
i
had
become
convinced
that
people
played
croquet
late
into
the
night
in
rooms
smelling
of
tobacco
and
liquor
and
were
tempted
to
drink
freely
of
the
latter
and
pawn
their
coats
if
necessary
to
get
money
enough
to
carry
out
the
game
you
see
there
is
a
difference
yet
people
can
gamble
in
playing
croquet
eurie
said
thoughtfully
oh
yes
and
people
can
gamble
with
pins
or
in
tossing
up
pennies
the
point
is
they
are
not
in
the
habit
of
doing
it
and
pins
suggest
no
such
thing
to
people
in
general
neither
do
croquet
balls
while
the
fact
remains
that
the
ordinary
use
of
cards
is
to
gamble
with
them
and
comparatively
few
of
those
who
use
them
habitually
confine
themselves
to
quiet
home
games
people
are
in
danger
of
making
their
brothers
offend
by
their
use
we
all
know
that
if
that
is
true
then
just
that
one
verse
from
the
bible
ought
to
settle
the
whole
question
there
was
no
mistaking
the
quiet
meaning
in
flossy
voice
it
was
as
good
as
saying
that
the
whole
question
settled
for
her
marion
regarded
her
with
evident
satisfaction
her
manner
was
all
the
more
fascinating
because
she
was
so
entirely
unconscious
that
this
way
of
looking
at
questions
rather
than
this
firm
manner
of
settling
questions
was
not
common
even
among
christians
can
you
show
me
the
verse
in
your
bible
she
presently
asked
i
can
do
that
same
with
the
greatest
pleasure
marion
said
bringing
forward
a
new
and
shining
concordance
i
really
meant
to
have
a
new
dress
this
fall
i
say
that
ruthie
for
your
special
comfort
but
the
truth
is
there
was
an
army
of
bible
verses
that
i
learned
in
my
youth
trooping
up
to
me
and
i
had
such
a
desire
to
see
the
connection
and
find
out
what
they
were
all
about
that
i
was
actually
obliged
to
sacrifice
the
dress
and
get
a
concordance
i
have
lots
of
comfort
with
it
here
is
the
verse
flossy
flossy
drew
the
bible
toward
her
with
a
little
sigh
i
wish
i
knew
an
army
of
verses
she
said
seems
to
me
i
do
know
any
at
all
then
she
went
to
reading
i
know
verses
enough
eurie
said
but
they
seem
to
be
in
a
great
muddle
in
my
brain
i
ca
remember
that
any
of
them
were
ever
explained
to
me
and
it
is
very
often
that
i
find
a
place
where
any
of
them
will
fit
in
they
do
fit
in
though
and
with
astonishing
closeness
you
will
find
as
you
grow
used
to
them
i
have
been
amazed
at
that
feature
of
the
bible
some
of
the
verses
that
occur
in
the
selections
for
parsing
are
just
wonderful
they
seem
aimed
directly
at
me
what
have
you
found
flossy
wonderful
things
said
flossy
flushing
and
smiling
you
are
reading
backward
are
you
i
know
those
verses
just
you
let
me
read
them
substituting
the
object
about
which
we
are
talking
and
see
how
they
will
fit
you
see
girls
this
astonishing
man
paul
by
name
do
you
happen
to
know
his
history
more
wonderful
things
happened
to
him
than
to
any
other
mortal
i
verily
believe
well
he
was
talking
about
idols
and
advising
his
christian
friends
not
to
eat
the
food
that
had
been
offered
to
idols
not
that
it
would
hurt
them
but
because
well
you
see
the
as
i
read
i
just
put
in
our
word
for
an
illustration
instead
of
meat
cards
commend
us
not
to
god
for
neither
if
we
play
are
we
the
better
neither
if
we
play
not
are
we
the
worse
but
take
heed
lest
by
any
means
this
liberty
of
yours
become
a
to
them
that
are
weak
for
if
any
man
see
thee
which
hast
knowledge
sit
at
cards
shall
not
the
conscience
of
him
which
is
weak
be
emboldened
to
sit
at
cards
also
and
through
thy
knowledge
shall
the
weak
brother
perish
for
whom
christ
died
but
when
ye
sin
so
against
the
brethren
and
wound
their
weak
conscience
ye
sin
against
christ
wherefore
if
cards
make
my
brother
to
offend
i
will
play
no
more
cards
while
the
world
standeth
lest
i
make
my
brother
to
offend
does
that
fit
let
me
look
at
that
said
eurie
suddenly
drawing
the
bible
to
her
after
all
she
said
after
a
moment
what
right
have
you
to
substitute
the
word
cards
it
is
talking
about
another
matter
now
eurie
mitchell
you
are
too
bright
to
make
such
a
remark
as
that
if
the
bible
is
for
our
help
as
well
as
for
paul
we
have
surely
the
right
to
substitute
the
noun
that
fits
our
present
needs
we
have
no
idols
nowadays
at
least
they
are
not
made
out
of
wood
and
stone
and
the
logic
of
the
question
is
as
clear
as
sunlight
we
have
only
to
understand
that
the
matter
of
playing
cards
is
a
snare
and
a
danger
to
some
people
and
we
see
our
duty
clearly
enough
because
how
are
we
ever
to
be
sure
that
the
very
person
who
will
be
tempted
is
not
within
the
reach
of
our
influence
what
do
you
think
flossy
is
the
question
any
clearer
to
you
why
yes
flossy
said
slowly
that
eighth
verse
settles
it
meat
commendeth
us
not
to
god
for
neither
if
we
eat
are
we
the
better
neither
if
we
eat
not
are
we
the
worse
it
certainly
can
do
no
one
any
harm
if
i
let
cards
alone
and
it
is
equally
certain
that
it
may
do
harm
if
i
play
them
i
should
think
my
duty
was
clear
i
wonder
what
baker
will
say
to
that
duty
queried
eurie
thinking
aloud
rather
than
speaking
to
any
one
he
is
very
much
given
over
to
the
amusement
if
i
am
not
mistaken
flossy
raised
her
eyes
and
fixed
them
thoughtfully
on
eurie
face
while
a
flush
spread
all
over
her
own
pretty
one
was
it
possible
that
she
had
helped
to
foster
this
taste
in
baker
how
evenings
she
had
spent
with
him
in
this
way
he
very
much
addicted
to
the
use
of
cards
she
wondered
that
is
outside
of
their
own
parlor
eurie
seemed
to
know
something
about
it
what
makes
you
think
so
she
asked
at
last
because
i
know
so
he
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
nell
infatuation
he
was
the
very
first
one
with
whom
nell
ever
played
for
anything
but
fun
flossy
shipley
you
surely
know
that
he
derives
a
good
deal
of
his
income
in
that
way
i
certainly
did
know
it
flossy
said
with
an
increasing
glow
on
her
cheeks
the
glow
was
caused
by
wondering
how
far
her
own
brother
charlie
had
been
led
by
this
man
girls
said
marion
concluding
that
a
change
of
subject
would
be
wise
would
a
bible
reading
evening
be
nice
what
kind
of
an
evening
can
that
be
marion
laughed
why
a
reading
together
out
of
the
bible
about
a
certain
subject
or
subjects
that
interested
us
and
about
which
we
wanted
to
inform
ourselves
like
this
for
instance
i
presume
there
are
dozens
of
texts
that
bear
on
this
very
question
it
would
be
nice
to
go
over
them
together
and
talk
them
up
flossy
eyes
brightened
i
would
like
that
exceedingly
she
said
i
need
the
help
of
you
all
i
know
so
very
little
about
the
bible
we
have
musical
evenings
and
literary
evenings
why
not
bible
evenings
let
do
it
apropos
of
the
subject
in
hand
before
we
take
up
a
new
one
what
do
you
think
of
this
by
way
of
illustration
ruth
asked
as
she
threw
down
on
the
table
a
daintily
written
epistle
there
was
an
eager
grasping
after
it
by
this
merry
trio
and
eurie
securing
it
read
aloud
it
was
an
invitation
for
the
next
evening
to
a
select
gathering
of
choice
spirits
for
the
purpose
of
enjoying
a
social
evening
at
cards
what
do
you
propose
to
do
with
it
marion
asked
as
eurie
balanced
the
note
on
her
hand
with
an
amused
face
the
illustration
fitted
so
remarkably
into
the
talk
decline
it
ruth
said
briefly
and
then
added
as
an
i
never
gave
the
subject
any
attention
in
my
life
i
am
perhaps
not
entirely
convinced
now
only
i
see
as
flossy
does
that
i
shall
certainly
do
no
harm
by
declining
whereas
it
seems
i
may
possibly
do
some
by
accepting
therefore
of
course
the
way
is
clear
she
said
it
with
the
utmost
composure
and
it
was
evident
that
the
idea
of
such
a
course
being
disagreeable
to
her
or
of
her
considering
it
a
cross
to
decline
had
not
occurred
to
her
she
cared
nothing
at
all
about
these
matters
and
had
only
been
involved
in
them
as
a
sort
of
necessity
belonging
to
society
she
was
more
than
willing
to
be
counted
out
as
for
flossy
she
drew
a
little
sigh
of
envy
she
would
have
given
much
to
have
been
constituted
like
ruth
erskine
she
knew
that
the
same
like
invitation
would
probably
come
to
her
and
she
knew
that
she
would
decline
it
but
aside
from
loss
of
the
pleasure
and
excitement
of
the
pretty
toilet
and
the
pleasant
evening
among
her
friends
she
foresaw
long
and
wearisome
discussions
with
baker
with
charlie
with
her
father
sarcastic
remarks
from
kitty
and
her
lover
and
a
long
train
of
annoyances
she
dreaded
them
all
it
was
so
easy
to
slip
along
with
the
current
it
was
so
hard
to
stem
it
and
insist
on
going
the
other
way
as
for
marion
wilbur
she
envied
them
both
a
chance
for
them
to
dash
out
into
a
new
channel
and
make
some
headway
not
the
everlasting
humdrum
sameness
that
filled
her
life
flossy
was
fascinated
with
the
bible
words
that
were
so
new
and
fresh
to
her
those
verses
cover
a
great
deal
of
ground
she
said
slowly
reading
them
over
again
i
can
think
of
a
good
many
things
which
we
call
right
enough
that
measured
by
that
test
would
have
to
be
changed
or
given
up
but
marion
you
spoke
of
dancing
and
i
ca
quite
see
what
the
verses
have
to
do
with
either
of
those
amusements
i
mean
not
as
we
and
the
people
in
our
set
have
to
do
with
such
things
do
you
think
every
form
of
dancing
is
wicked
what
wholesale
questions
you
ask
my
morsel
and
you
ask
them
precisely
as
though
i
had
been
made
umpire
and
you
must
abide
by
my
decisions
whatever
they
are
now
do
you
know
i
never
believed
in
dancing
i
had
some
queer
perhaps
notions
about
it
all
my
life
even
before
there
was
any
such
thing
as
a
conscientious
scruple
about
it
i
should
not
have
danced
if
i
had
had
a
hundred
chances
to
mingle
in
just
the
set
that
you
do
so
perhaps
i
am
not
the
one
of
whom
to
ask
that
question
i
should
think
you
were
just
the
one
if
you
have
examined
it
and
know
why
you
think
so
you
can
surely
tell
me
and
give
me
a
chance
to
see
whether
i
ought
to
think
as
you
do
or
not
need
posting
decidedly
on
that
question
eurie
said
throwing
off
her
earnestness
and
looking
amused
if
there
is
anyone
thing
above
another
that
i
do
thoroughly
enjoy
it
is
dancing
and
i
give
you
all
fair
warning
i
do
mean
to
be
coaxed
out
of
it
very
easily
i
shall
fight
hard
for
that
bit
of
fun
marion
do
know
anything
about
it
for
she
never
danced
but
the
rest
of
you
know
just
what
a
delicious
exercise
it
is
and
i
do
believe
when
it
is
indulged
in
reasonably
and
at
proper
places
there
is
any
harm
at
all
in
it
if
i
am
to
give
it
up
you
will
have
to
show
me
strong
reasons
why
i
should
all
this
fits
right
in
with
my
idea
marion
said
nothing
could
be
more
suitable
for
our
first
bible
reading
let
us
take
an
evening
for
it
and
prepare
ourselves
as
well
as
we
can
beforehand
and
examine
into
the
bible
view
of
it
eurie
you
will
be
expected
to
be
armed
with
all
the
scriptural
arguments
in
its
favor
i
try
for
the
other
side
now
ruth
and
flossy
which
side
will
you
choose
neither
ruth
said
promptly
i
am
interested
in
the
subject
and
shall
be
glad
to
be
informed
as
to
what
the
bible
says
about
it
if
any
of
you
are
smart
enough
to
find
anything
that
will
bear
on
the
subject
but
i
believe
the
bible
left
that
as
well
as
some
other
things
to
our
common
sense
and
that
each
of
us
have
to
decide
the
matter
for
ourselves
all
right
said
marion
we
accept
you
on
the
side
only
remember
you
are
to
try
to
prove
from
the
bible
that
it
has
left
to
decide
this
matter
for
ourselves
i
shall
take
every
side
that
i
find
flossy
said
what
i
want
to
know
is
the
truth
about
things
without
regard
as
to
whether
the
truth
is
so
fortunate
as
to
agree
with
your
opinion
or
not
said
marion
you
will
probably
be
quite
as
likely
to
find
the
truth
as
any
of
us
well
i
like
the
plan
there
is
work
in
it
and
it
will
amount
to
something
when
shall
it
be
next
friday

looking

dennis
had
just
gone
into
his

to
make
ready
for
the
evening
when
he
heard
his
ring
he
remembered
with
a
shade
of
anxiety
that
his
daughter
was
not
yet
out
of
school
and
that
his
sister
and
housekeeper
was
not
at
home
it
was
more
than
likely
that
he
would
be
interrupted
what
is
it
hannah
he
asked
as
that
person
appeared
at
his
door
it
is
miss
erskine
sir
i
told
her
that
miss
dennis
was
out
of
town
and
miss
grace
was
at
school
and
she
said
it
was
of
no
consequence
she
wanted
to
see
the
minister
himself
will
i
tell
her
that
you
are
engaged
no
said
dennis
promptly
the
sensation
was
still
very
new
this
desire
on
the
part
of
any
of
the
name
of
erskine
to
see
him
his
preparation
could
afford
to
wait
two
minutes
more
and
ruth
was
in
the
study
it
was
a
place
in
which
she
felt
as
nearly
embarrassed
as
she
ever
approached
to
that
feeling
she
had
a
specific
purpose
in
calling
and
words
arranged
wherewith
to
commence
her
topic
but
they
fled
from
her
as
if
she
had
been
a
school
girl
instead
of
a
finished
young
lady
in
society
and
she
answered
the
doctor
kind
enquiries
as
to
the
health
of
her
father
and
herself
in
an
absent
and
constrained
manner
at
last
this
good
man
concluded
to
help
her
is
there
any
thing
special
that
i
can
do
for
you
he
asked
with
a
kindly
interest
in
his
tone
that
suggested
the
feeling
that
he
was
interested
in
her
plans
whatever
they
were
and
would
be
glad
to
help
yes
she
said
surprised
into
frankness
by
his
straightforward
way
of
doing
things
or
at
least
i
hope
you
can
dennis
ought
not
every
christian
to
be
at
work
our
great
example
said
must
work
the
works
of
him
that
sent
me
while
it
is
day
i
know
it
that
very
verse
set
me
to
thinking
about
it
that
is
what
i
want
help
about
there
is
no
work
for
me
to
do
at
least
i
ca
find
any
i
am
doing
just
nothing
at
all
and
i
do
in
the
least
know
which
way
to
turn
i
am
not
satisfied
with
this
state
of
things
i
settle
back
to
my
books
and
my
music
as
i
did
before
i
went
away
i
do
enjoy
them
as
i
used
to
i
mean
they
do
absorb
me
they
seem
to
be
of
no
earthly
use
to
anyone
but
myself
and
i
do
feel
absolutely
certain
that
they
are
of
any
use
to
me
anyway
they
are
not
christian
work
as
to
that
you
are
not
to
be
too
certain
about
it
wonderful
things
can
be
done
with
music
and
when
one
is
given
a
marked
talent
for
it
as
i
hear
has
been
the
case
with
you
it
is
not
to
be
hidden
in
a
napkin
i
do
know
what
i
can
do
with
music
i
am
sure
ruth
said
skeptically
i
suppose
i
must
have
a
good
deal
of
talent
in
that
direction
i
have
been
told
so
ever
since
i
can
remember
but
beyond
entertaining
my
friends
i
see
no
other
special
use
for
it
do
you
remember
telling
me
about
the
songs
which
bliss
sang
at
chautauqua
and
the
effect
on
the
audience
yes
said
ruth
speaking
heartily
and
her
cheeks
glowing
at
the
recollection
but
he
was
wonderful
the
same
work
can
be
done
in
a
smaller
way
dennis
said
smiling
i
hope
to
show
you
something
of
what
you
may
do
to
help
in
that
way
before
another
winter
passes
but
in
the
meantime
mere
entertainment
of
friends
is
not
a
bad
motive
for
keeping
up
one
music
then
there
is
the
uncertain
future
ever
before
us
what
if
you
should
be
called
upon
to
teach
music
some
day
a
vision
of
herself
toiling
wearily
from
house
to
house
in
all
weathers
and
at
all
hours
of
the
day
as
she
had
seen
music
teachers
do
hovered
over
ruth
erskine
brain
and
so
utterly
improbable
and
absurd
did
the
picture
seem
when
she
imagined
it
as
having
any
reference
to
her
that
she
laughed
outright
i
do
believe
i
shall
ever
teach
music
she
said
positively
perhaps
not
and
yet
stranger
things
than
that
happened
in
this
changeful
life
but
dennis
she
said
with
sudden
energy
and
showing
a
touch
of
annoyance
at
the
turn
which
the
talk
was
taking
my
trouble
is
not
an
inability
to
employ
my
time
i
do
not
belong
to
the
class
of
young
ladies
who
are
afflicted
with
and
a
sarcastic
curve
of
her
handsome
lip
made
ruth
look
very
like
the
miss
erskine
that
dennis
had
always
known
she
despised
people
who
had
no
resources
within
themselves
i
can
find
plenty
to
do
and
i
enjoy
doing
it
but
the
point
is
i
seem
to
be
living
only
for
myself
and
that
does
seem
right
i
want
christian
work
to
tell
the
truth
dennis
was
puzzled
there
was
so
much
work
to
do
his
hands
and
heart
were
always
so
full
and
running
over
that
it
seemed
strange
to
him
for
anyone
to
come
looking
for
christian
work
the
world
was
teeming
with
it
on
the
other
hand
he
confessed
to
himself
that
he
was
utterly
unaccustomed
to
hearing
people
ask
for
work
or
if
the
facts
be
told
to
having
any
one
do
any
work
years
ago
he
had
tried
to
set
the
people
of
the
first
church
to
work
but
they
had
stared
at
him
and
misunderstood
him
and
he
confessed
to
himself
that
he
had
given
over
trying
to
get
work
out
of
most
of
them
while
this
experience
was
refreshing
it
was
new
and
left
him
for
the
moment
bewildered
i
understand
you
he
said
rallying
there
is
plenty
of
christian
work
do
you
want
to
take
a
class
in
the
there
is
a
vacancy
ruth
shook
her
head
with
decision
that
is
not
at
all
my
i
have
no
faculty
for
teaching
children
i
am
entirely
unused
to
them
and
have
no
special
interest
in
them
and
no
sort
of
idea
how
they
are
to
be
managed
some
people
are
specially
fitted
for
such
work
i
know
i
am
not
often
we
find
our
work
much
nearer
home
than
we
had
planned
dennis
said
regarding
her
with
a
thoughtful
air
how
is
it
with
your
father
miss
erskine
my
father
she
repeated
and
she
could
hardly
have
looked
more
bewildered
if
her
pastor
had
asked
after
the
welfare
of
the
man
in
the
moon
are
you
trying
to
win
him
over
to
the
lord
side
utter
silence
and
surprise
on
miss
erskine
part
at
last
she
said
i
hardly
ever
see
my
father
we
are
never
alone
except
when
we
are
on
our
way
to
dinner
or
to
pay
formal
calls
on
very
formal
people
then
we
are
always
in
a
hurry
i
can
not
reach
my
father
dennis
he
is
immersed
in
business
and
has
no
time
nor
heart
for
such
matters
i
should
not
in
the
least
know
how
to
approach
him
if
i
had
a
chance
and
indeed
i
am
sure
i
could
do
no
good
for
he
would
esteem
it
an
impertinence
to
be
questioned
by
his
daughter
as
to
his
thoughts
on
these
matters
yet
you
have
an
earnest
desire
to
see
him
a
christian
yes
she
said
speaking
slowly
and
hesitatingly
of
course
i
have
that
to
be
very
frank
dennis
it
is
a
hopeless
sort
of
desire
i
do
expect
it
in
the
least
my
father
is
peculiarly
unapproachable
i
know
he
considers
himself
sufficient
unto
himself
if
you
will
allow
the
expression
in
thinking
of
him
i
have
felt
that
a
great
many
years
from
now
when
he
is
old
and
when
business
cares
and
responsibilities
have
in
a
measure
fallen
off
and
given
him
time
to
think
of
himself
he
might
then
feel
his
need
of
a
friend
and
be
won
but
i
do
even
hope
for
it
before
that
time
my
dear
friend
you
have
really
no
right
to
set
a
different
time
from
the
one
that
your
master
has
set
her
pastor
said
earnestly
you
know
that
his
time
is
always
how
can
you
be
sure
that
he
will
choose
to
give
your
father
a
long
life
and
leisure
in
old
age
to
help
him
to
think
is
that
a
terrible
risk
ruth
erskine
shook
her
decided
head
i
feel
sure
that
my
work
is
not
in
that
direction
she
said
i
could
not
do
it
you
do
not
know
my
father
as
well
as
i
do
he
would
never
allow
me
to
approach
him
the
most
i
can
hope
to
do
will
be
to
hold
what
he
calls
my
new
views
so
far
into
the
background
that
he
will
not
positively
forbid
them
to
me
he
is
the
only
person
i
think
of
whom
i
stand
absolutely
in
awe
then
i
could
talk
with
him
his
life
is
a
pure
spotless
one
convincing
by
its
very
morality
so
he
thinks
that
there
is
no
need
of
a
saviour
i
do
pray
for
him
i
mean
to
as
long
as
he
and
i
live
but
i
know
i
can
do
nothing
else
at
least
not
for
many
a
year
how
was
dennis
to
set
to
work
a
lady
who
knew
so
much
that
she
could
not
work
this
was
the
thought
that
puzzled
him
but
he
knew
how
difficult
it
was
for
people
to
work
in
channels
marked
out
by
others
so
he
said
encouragingly
i
can
conceive
of
some
of
your
difficulties
in
that
direction
but
you
have
other
friends
who
are
not
christians
this
being
said
inquiringly
ruth
after
a
moment
of
hesitation
answered
it
i
have
one
friend
to
whom
i
have
tried
to
talk
about
this
matter
but
i
have
had
no
success
he
is
very
peculiar
in
his
views
and
feelings
he
agrees
to
every
thing
that
i
say
and
admits
the
wisdom
and
reasonableness
of
it
all
but
he
goes
no
further
there
are
a
great
many
such
people
dennis
said
with
a
quick
sigh
he
met
many
of
them
himself
they
are
the
hardest
class
to
reach
does
your
friend
believe
in
the
power
of
prayer
i
have
generally
found
the
safest
and
shortest
way
with
such
to
be
to
use
my
influence
in
inducing
them
to
begin
to
pray
if
they
admit
its
power
and
its
reasonableness
it
is
such
a
very
simple
thing
to
do
for
a
friend
that
they
can
hardly
refuse
i
do
think
he
ever
prays
ruth
said
and
i
do
believe
he
would
he
would
think
it
hypocritical
he
says
as
much
as
that
half
the
praying
must
be
mockery
granting
that
to
be
the
case
does
he
think
he
should
therefore
not
offer
real
prayer
that
would
be
a
sad
state
because
i
have
many
hypocrites
in
my
family
whose
words
to
me
are
mockery
therefore
no
one
must
be
a
true
friend
i
know
said
ruth
interrupting
but
i
do
know
how
to
reach
such
people
perhaps
he
may
be
your
work
dennis
but
i
do
think
he
is
mine
i
do
in
the
least
know
what
to
say
to
him
i
refer
to
mr
wayne
i
know
him
dennis
said
but
he
is
not
inclined
to
talk
with
me
i
have
not
the
intimacy
with
him
that
would
lead
him
to
be
familiar
i
should
be
very
certain
if
i
were
you
that
my
work
did
not
lie
in
that
direction
before
i
turned
from
it
i
am
certain
ruth
said
with
a
little
laugh
i
do
know
how
to
talk
to
such
people
i
should
feel
sure
of
doing
more
harm
than
good
but
my
dear
miss
erskine
i
beg
your
pardon
for
the
reminder
but
since
you
are
thrown
much
into
his
society
will
it
not
be
necessary
for
you
as
a
christian
to
talk
more
or
less
about
this
matter
should
not
your
talk
be
shaped
in
such
a
way
as
to
influence
him
if
you
can
i
do
think
i
understand
ruth
said
doubtfully
do
you
mean
that
people
should
talk
about
religion
all
the
time
they
are
together
during
this
question
dennis
had
drawn
his
bible
toward
him
and
been
turning
over
the
leaves
just
let
me
read
you
a
word
from
the
on
this
subject
let
your
conversation
be
as
becometh
the
gospel
of
christ
he
which
hath
called
you
is
holy
so
be
ye
holy
in
all
manner
of
conversation
then
that
all
these
things
shall
be
dissolved
what
manner
of
person
ought
ye
to
be
in
all
holy
conversation
and
godliness
what
should
you
conclude
as
to
christian
duty
in
the
matter
of
daily
conversation
ruth
made
no
answer
to
this
question
but
sat
with
earnest
thoughtful
look
fixed
on
her
pastor
face
who
follows
that
pattern
she
asked
at
last
my
dear
friend
is
not
our
concern
rather
to
decide
whether
you
and
i
shall
try
to
do
it
in
the
future
someway
this
brought
the
talk
to
a
sudden
lull
ruth
seemed
to
have
no
more
to
say
there
is
another
way
of
work
that
i
have
been
intending
to
suggest
to
some
of
you
young
ladies
dennis
said
after
a
thoughtful
silence
it
is
something
very
much
neglected
in
our
church
that
is
the
social
question
do
you
know
we
have
many
members
who
complain
that
they
are
never
called
on
never
spoken
with
never
noticed
in
any
way
i
do
know
anything
about
the
members
ruth
said
i
do
think
i
have
a
personal
acquaintance
with
twenty
of
them
a
calling
acquaintance
i
mean
that
is
the
case
with
a
great
many
and
it
is
a
state
of
things
that
should
not
exist
the
family
ought
to
know
each
other
i
begin
to
see
your
work
clearer
it
is
the
young
ladies
to
a
large
extent
who
must
remedy
this
evil
suppose
you
take
up
some
of
that
work
not
neglecting
the
other
of
course
ought
ye
to
have
done
and
not
to
have
left
the
other
undone
i
am
afraid
will
be
said
to
a
good
many
of
us
but
this
is
certainly
work
needing
to
be
done
and
work
for
which
you
have
leisure
he
hoped
to
see
her
face
brighten
but
it
did
not
instead
she
said
i
hate
calling
i
dare
say
calling
that
is
aimless
and
in
a
sense
useless
it
must
be
hateful
work
but
if
you
start
out
with
an
object
in
view
a
something
to
accomplish
that
is
worth
your
while
will
it
not
make
a
great
difference
ruth
only
sighed
i
have
so
many
calls
to
make
with
father
she
said
wearily
it
is
the
worst
work
i
do
they
are
upon
fashionable
frivolous
people
who
can
not
talk
about
it
is
worse
martyrdom
now
than
it
used
to
be
i
think
i
am
peculiarly
unfitted
for
such
work
dr
dennis
but
i
want
you
to
try
a
different
style
of
calls
go
alone
not
with
your
father
or
with
anyone
who
will
trammel
your
tongue
and
go
among
a
class
of
people
who
do
not
expect
you
and
will
be
surprised
and
pleased
and
helped
perhaps
come
let
me
give
you
a
list
of
persons
whom
i
would
like
to
have
you
call
on
at
your
earliest
opportunity
this
is
work
that
i
am
really
longing
to
see
done
a
prisoner
about
to
receive
sentence
could
hardly
have
looked
more
gloomy
than
did
ruth
she
was
still
for
a
few
minutes
then
she
said
dennis
do
you
really
think
it
is
a
person
duty
to
do
that
sort
of
work
for
which
he
or
she
feels
least
qualified
and
which
is
the
most
distasteful
no
said
dennis
promptly
my
dear
miss
erskine
will
you
be
so
kind
as
to
tell
me
the
work
for
which
you
feel
qualified
and
for
which
you
have
no
distaste
again
ruth
hesitated
looked
confused
and
then
laughed
she
began
to
see
that
she
was
making
a
very
difficult
task
for
her
pastor
i
do
feel
qualified
for
anything
she
said
at
last
and
i
feel
afraid
to
undertake
anything
but
at
the
same
time
i
think
i
ought
to
be
at
work
now
we
begin
to
see
the
way
clearer
he
said
smiling
and
with
encouragement
in
his
voice
it
may
seem
a
strange
thing
to
you
but
a
sense
of
unfitness
is
sometimes
one
of
the
very
best
qualifications
for
such
work
if
it
is
strong
enough
to
drive
us
to
the
blessed
friend
who
has
promised
to
make
perfect
our
weakness
in
this
as
in
all
other
efforts
and
if
we
go
out
armed
in
his
strength
we
are
sure
to
conquer
try
it
take
this
for
your
motto
ye
have
opportunity
and
by
the
way
do
you
know
the
rest
of
that
verse
to
them
who
are
of
the
household
of
faith
it
is
members
of
the
household
that
i
want
you
to
call
on
remember
ruth
laughed
again
and
shook
her
head
but
she
took
her
list
and
went
away
she
had
no
more
that
she
wanted
to
say
just
then
but
she
felt
that
she
had
food
for
thought
i
may
try
it
she
said
as
she
went
out
holding
up
her
list
but
i
feel
that
i
shall
blunder
and
do
more
harm
than
good
dennis
looked
after
her
with
a
face
on
which
there
was
no
smile
there
goes
one
he
said
to
himself
who
thinks
she
is
willing
to
be
led
but
on
the
contrary
she
wants
to
lead
she
is
saved
but
not
subdued
i
wonder
what
means
the
great
master
will
have
to
use
to
lead
her
to
rest
in
his
hands
knowing
no
way
but
his
illustration

chapter
xiv
an
unarmed
soldier
many
things
intervened
to
keep
ruth
erskine
from
having
much
to
do
with
that
list
which
her
pastor
had
given
her
she
read
it
over
indeed
and
realized
that
she
was
not
familiar
with
a
single
name
what
an
idea
it
will
be
for
me
to
go
blundering
through
the
city
hunting
up
people
whom
i
shall
not
know
when
i
find
this
she
said
as
she
read
it
over
then
she
laid
it
aside
and
made
ready
to
go
out
to
dinner
with
her
father
to
meet
two
judges
and
their
wives
and
daughters
who
were
stopping
in
town
during
that
day
she
thought
many
times
of
the
sentences
that
had
been
read
to
her
out
of
that
bible
on
the
only
effect
they
had
on
her
was
to
make
her
smile
at
the
thought
of
the
impossibility
of
anything
like
a
religious
conversation
in
such
society
as
that
how
they
would
stare
she
said
to
herself
if
i
should
ask
them
about
a
i
have
half
a
mind
to
try
it
if
father
were
not
within
hearing
i
would
just
to
see
what
these
finished
young
ladies
would
say
but
she
did
not
try
it
and
the
evening
passed
as
so
many
evenings
had
without
an
attempt
on
her
part
to
carry
out
any
of
the
thoughts
which
troubled
her
she
looked
forward
to
one
bit
of
work
which
she
expected
to
fall
to
her
share
at
least
she
liked
to
call
it
work
that
to
which
she
had
been
invited
she
would
be
expected
to
attend
in
company
with
wayne
she
meant
to
decline
and
her
father
would
be
surprised
and
a
trifle
annoyed
for
it
was
at
a
place
where
not
liking
the
people
well
enough
himself
to
be
social
he
desired
his
daughter
to
atone
for
his
deficiency
but
she
would
steadily
refuse
she
did
not
shrink
from
this
effort
as
flossy
did
on
the
contrary
she
half
enjoyed
the
thought
of
being
a
calm
and
composed
martyr
but
quite
to
her
discomfort
the
martyrdom
was
not
permitted
at
least
it
took
a
different
form
wayne
was
obliged
to
be
out
of
town
and
sent
profuse
regrets
assuming
that
of
course
it
would
be
a
sore
disappointment
to
her
her
father
took
sufficient
notice
of
it
to
make
one
or
two
efforts
to
agreeably
supply
his
place
and
failing
in
that
assured
his
daughter
that
rather
than
have
her
disappointed
he
would
have
planned
to
accompany
her
himself
if
he
had
known
of
wayne
absence
in
time
the
actual
cross
that
it
would
have
been
to
explain
to
her
father
that
she
did
not
desire
to
go
and
the
reasons
therefor
she
did
not
take
up
but
the
occurrence
served
to
annoy
her
two
days
afterward
she
was
busy
all
the
morning
with
her
dressmaker
getting
a
special
dress
ready
for
a
wedding
among
the
upper
circles
she
had
been
hurried
and
worried
and
was
as
nearly
out
of
patience
as
her
calmness
ever
allowed
her
to
be
still
she
remembered
that
it
was
the
evening
that
she
should
see
dennis
and
that
he
would
be
likely
to
ask
her
about
the
people
on
that
list
she
ought
to
go
that
afternoon
and
try
what
she
could
do
once
since
her
call
on
dennis
she
had
met
him
as
he
was
going
down
clinton
street
and
he
had
turned
and
joined
her
for
a
few
steps
while
he
said
i
have
been
thinking
about
another
friend
of
yours
that
i
should
be
very
glad
to
see
influenced
in
the
right
direction
his
sister
is
trying
i
presume
but
other
people
sisters
some
times
have
an
influence
young
mitchell
the
doctor
son
is
a
young
man
of
real
promise
he
ought
to
be
on
the
lord
side
you
are
mistaken
in
supposing
him
to
be
a
friend
of
mine
ruth
said
with
promptness
and
emphasis
we
have
the
most
distant
speaking
acquaintance
only
and
i
have
a
dislike
for
him
amounting
to
absolute
aversion
there
was
that
in
ruth
erskine
voice
when
she
chose
to
let
it
appear
that
said
my
aversion
is
a
very
serious
and
disagreeable
thing
yes
the
doctor
said
quietly
as
one
in
no
degree
surprised
or
disturbed
yet
he
has
a
soul
to
be
saved
and
the
lord
jesus
christ
died
to
save
him
there
was
no
denying
this
and
certainly
it
would
not
look
well
in
her
to
say
that
she
had
no
desire
to
have
part
in
his
salvation
so
she
kept
silence
but
there
followed
her
a
disagreeable
remembrance
of
having
negatived
every
proposition
whereby
the
doctor
had
hoped
to
set
her
at
work
she
decided
disagreeable
as
it
was
to
make
a
vigorous
assault
on
those
families
thereby
showing
him
what
she
could
do
to
this
end
she
arrayed
herself
in
immaculate
calling
attire
with
a
rustle
of
silk
and
a
softness
of
ruffle
and
a
daintiness
of
glove
that
none
but
the
wealthy
can
assume
and
in
short
with
that
unmistakable
air
about
every
thing
pertaining
to
her
that
marks
the
lady
of
fashion
these
things
were
as
much
a
part
of
ruth
erskine
as
her
hair
and
eyes
were
once
ready
her
dress
perhaps
gave
her
as
little
thought
as
her
eyes
or
hair
did
but
she
looked
as
though
that
must
have
been
the
sole
object
of
thought
and
study
in
order
to
produce
such
perfect
results
her
preparation
for
her
new
and
untried
work
had
been
none
of
the
best
as
i
said
the
morning
had
been
given
to
the
cares
of
the
dressmaker
and
the
deceitfulness
of
trimmings
so
much
so
that
her
bible
reading
even
had
been
omitted
and
only
the
briefest
and
most
hurried
of
prayers
worthy
of
the
days
when
prayer
was
nothing
to
her
but
a
formal
bowing
of
the
head
on
proper
occasions
had
marked
her
need
of
help
from
the
almighty
hand
these
thoughts
troubled
her
as
she
went
down
the
street
she
paused
irresolutely
before
one
of
the
principal
bookstores
i
ought
to
have
some
tracts
she
said
doubtfully
to
herself
they
always
take
tracts
when
they
go
district
visiting
i
know
that
from
hearing
whipple
talk
what
is
this
but
a
district
visiting
only
dennis
has
put
my
district
all
over
the
city
i
wonder
if
he
could
have
scattered
the
streets
more
if
he
had
tried
respectable
streets
though
all
of
them
better
than
any
whipple
ever
told
about
then
she
tried
to
select
her
tracts
but
when
one
has
utter
ignorance
of
such
literature
and
a
few
minutes
at
a
crowded
counter
in
which
to
make
a
selection
it
is
not
likely
to
be
very
select
she
finally
gave
up
any
attempt
at
choice
beyond
a
few
whose
titles
seemed
inviting
chose
a
package
at
random
and
hastened
on
her
way
sullivan
was
the
first
name
on
her
list
and
following
her
directions
she
came
presently
to
the
street
and
number
a
neat
brick
house
with
a
modern
air
about
it
and
its
surroundings
a
bird
singing
in
a
cage
before
the
open
window
and
pots
of
flowers
blooming
behind
tastefully
looped
white
curtains
not
at
all
the
sort
of
a
house
that
ruth
had
imagined
she
would
see
it
did
not
suit
her
ideas
of
district
visiting
crude
though
those
ideas
were
however
she
rang
the
bell
having
commenced
the
task
she
was
not
one
to
draw
back
though
she
admitted
to
herself
that
she
never
felt
more
embarrassed
in
her
life
nor
did
the
embarrassment
lessen
when
she
was
shown
into
the
pretty
tasteful
parlor
where
presently
sullivan
joined
her
i
am
miss
erskine
ruth
said
rising
as
sullivan
a
tall
woman
of
some
degree
of
dignity
after
a
slight
bow
waited
as
if
she
would
know
her
errand
unfortunately
ruth
had
no
errand
save
that
she
had
come
out
to
do
her
duty
and
make
the
sort
of
call
that
dennis
expected
her
to
make
her
embarrassment
was
excessive
what
she
do
or
say
next
why
did
not
sullivan
take
a
chair
instead
of
standing
there
and
looking
at
her
like
an
idiot
do
you
get
out
to
church
every
sabbath
she
asked
suddenly
feeling
the
need
of
saying
something
sullivan
looked
as
though
she
thought
she
had
suddenly
come
in
contact
with
a
lunatic
do
i
get
out
to
church
she
repeated
that
depends
on
whether
i
decide
to
go
or
not
may
i
ask
why
you
are
interested
what
had
become
of
ruth
common
sense
why
could
she
have
said
in
as
natural
a
way
as
she
would
have
talked
about
going
to
a
concert
that
she
was
interested
to
know
whether
she
enjoyed
such
a
privilege
why
could
she
have
been
herself
in
talking
about
these
matters
as
well
as
at
any
other
time
does
anyone
know
why
such
a
sense
of
horrible
embarrassment
creeps
over
some
people
when
their
conversation
takes
the
least
tinge
of
religion
people
who
are
wonderfully
on
all
other
themes
well
said
ruth
in
haste
and
confusion
i
merely
inquired
i
mean
no
offence
certainly
will
you
have
a
tract
and
she
hastily
seized
one
from
her
package
which
happened
to
be
entitled
why
are
you
not
a
christian
thank
you
sullivan
said
drawing
back
i
am
not
in
special
need
of
reading
matter
we
keep
ourselves
supplied
with
religious
literature
of
a
kind
that
suits
our
tastes
as
to
tracts
i
always
keep
a
package
by
me
to
distribute
when
i
go
among
the
poor
this
one
would
not
be
particularly
appropriate
to
me
as
i
trust
i
am
a
christian
dear
me
how
stiff
and
proper
they
both
were
and
in
their
hearts
how
indignant
they
both
felt
what
about
could
either
of
them
have
told
i
wonder
what
earthly
good
that
call
did
ruth
asked
herself
as
with
glowing
cheeks
and
rapid
steps
she
made
her
way
down
the
street
what
could
have
been
dennis
object
in
sending
me
there
to
call
i
thought
i
was
to
call
on
the
poor
he
did
say
any
thing
about
whether
they
were
poor
or
not
now
i
think
of
it
but
i
supposed
of
course
that
was
what
he
meant
why
need
she
have
been
so
disagreeable
anyway
i
am
sure
i
did
insult
her
and
i
tell
you
truly
that
miss
erskine
did
not
know
that
she
had
seemed
disagreeable
in
the
extreme
to
sullivan
and
that
she
was
at
that
moment
raging
over
it
in
her
heart
extremely
disgusted
with
her
first
attempt
and
almost
ready
to
declare
that
it
should
be
the
last
ruth
still
decided
to
make
one
more
venture
that
inborn
dislike
which
she
had
for
giving
up
what
had
once
been
undertaken
coming
to
her
aid
in
this
matter
another
pretty
little
house
white
and
green
blinds
and
plant
in
bloom
the
name
on
the
door
and
on
her
list
was
smith
that
told
her
very
little
she
was
ushered
into
what
was
evidently
the
family
and
a
pretty
enough
room
it
was
occupied
just
now
by
three
merry
girls
who
hushed
their
laugh
as
she
entered
and
by
a
matronly
lady
whom
one
of
them
called
mother
ruth
had
never
made
calls
before
when
she
had
the
least
tinge
of
embarrassment
if
she
could
have
divested
herself
of
the
idea
that
she
was
a
district
visitor
out
distributing
tracts
she
would
not
have
felt
so
now
but
as
it
was
the
feeling
grew
upon
her
every
instant
pretty
little
miss
smith
had
decidedly
the
advantage
of
her
as
she
said
promptly
good
afternoon
miss
erskine
mother
this
is
judge
daughter
and
then
proceeded
to
introduce
her
friends
now
if
ruth
could
have
become
unprofessional
all
might
have
been
well
but
she
had
gone
out
with
a
sincere
desire
to
do
her
duty
so
she
took
the
offered
seat
near
smith
and
said
i
called
this
afternoon
at
dennis
request
to
see
if
there
was
anything
that
i
could
do
for
you
smith
looked
politely
amazed
i
do
think
i
quite
understand
she
said
slowly
while
in
the
daughter
bright
eyes
there
gleamed
mirth
and
mischief
i
do
she
said
quickly
dennis
is
very
kind
miss
erskine
i
am
very
anxious
to
have
a
blue
silk
dress
trimmed
in
white
lace
to
wear
to
the
party
next
week
could
you
manage
it
for
me
do
you
think
caroline
spoke
smith
in
a
surprised
and
reproving
tone
while
ruth
looked
her
indignant
astonishment
well
mother
she
said
she
called
to
see
if
we
wanted
anything
and
i
certainly
want
that
there
is
some
mistake
smith
said
speaking
kindly
and
evidently
pitying
ruth
dreadful
embarrassment
you
have
mistaken
the
house
i
presume
our
name
is
such
a
common
one
you
are
out
on
an
errand
of
charity
i
presume
we
are
glad
to
see
you
of
course
but
we
are
not
in
need
of
anything
but
friends
i
believe
you
attend
the
same
church
with
ourselves
we
ought
to
know
each
other
of
course
so
we
shall
profit
by
the
mistake
after
all
my
daughter
is
a
wild
little
girl
and
lets
her
sense
of
fun
get
the
better
of
her
politeness
sometimes
i
hope
you
will
excuse
her
what
was
to
be
said
why
could
not
ruth
get
rid
of
her
horrible
embarrassment
and
rally
to
meet
this
kind
and
frank
greeting
in
vain
she
tried
to
command
her
tongue
to
think
of
something
to
say
that
would
be
proper
under
these
strange
circumstances
how
had
she
misunderstood
dennis
why
should
these
people
be
called
on
why
should
they
feel
that
they
were
being
neglected
when
they
were
in
need
of
nothing
it
was
all
a
mystery
to
her
and
the
world
is
full
of
people
who
do
not
understand
a
sense
of
loneliness
whose
lives
are
so
full
of
friendships
and
engagements
and
society
that
they
imagine
all
other
people
are
like
themselves
except
that
class
known
as
the
poor
who
need
old
clothes
and
cold
pieces
and
tracts
that
was
all
that
ruth
erskine
knew
she
could
not
recover
from
her
astonishment
and
confusion
she
made
her
stay
very
short
indeed
apologizing
in
what
she
was
conscious
was
an
awkward
way
for
her
intrusion
and
then
went
directly
toward
home
resolving
in
great
firmness
that
she
had
made
her
last
calls
on
people
selected
from
that
horrible
list
she
was
more
than
embarrassed
she
was
utterly
dismayed
and
disheartened
was
there
then
nothing
for
her
to
do
it
had
been
a
real
honest
desire
to
be
up
and
doing
which
had
sent
her
to
dennis
it
had
been
a
real
cross
and
one
keenly
felt
to
take
up
this
work
about
which
she
had
started
what
an
utter
failure
what
could
he
have
meant
how
was
she
expected
to
help
those
people
they
needed
nothing
they
were
christian
people
they
were
pleasantly
circumstanced
in
every
way
she
had
not
the
least
idea
how
to
be
of
any
help
to
them
there
was
nothing
for
her
to
do
she
felt
humbled
and
sad
yet
that
young
lady
was
joined
in
a
few
minutes
by
nellis
mitchell
who
cordially
volunteered
to
shield
her
dainty
summer
toilet
from
certain
drops
of
rain
that
began
to
fall
and
so
walked
six
entire
blocks
by
her
side
pleasant
and
genial
as
usual
and
not
a
word
said
she
to
him
about
the
great
topic
to
which
her
life
was
consecrated
he
even
helped
her
by
himself
referring
to
the
evening
meeting
and
saying
that
he
should
have
to
escort
eurie
as
far
as
the
door
if
this
rain
continued
and
she
did
not
so
much
as
think
to
ask
him
to
come
farther
and
enjoy
the
meeting
with
them
she
did
not
like
nellis
mitchell
you
will
remember
also
that
same
evening
she
spent
an
hour
after
in
conversation
with
her
friend
wayne
and
she
said
not
a
single
word
to
him
about
this
matter
she
could
not
talk
with
him
she
told
herself
he
did
not
understand
her
and
it
did
no
good
some
time
when
he
was
in
a
less
complaisant
mood
she
could
do
something
for
him
but
not
now
she
was
not
very
companionable
however
her
mind
was
dwelling
on
her
afternoon
disappointment
it
was
the
most
horrid
time
i
ever
had
in
my
life
she
told
marion
after
going
over
an
account
of
the
experience
i
shall
not
be
caught
in
that
way
again
and
marion
unsympathetic
girl
that
she
was
laughed
much
and
long
what
a
creature
you
are
she
said
at
last
i
declare
it
is
funny
that
people
can
live
in
the
world
and
know
so
little
about
their
as
you
and
flossy
do
she
knows
no
more
about
them
than
a
kitten
does
and
you
know
no
more
than
the
moon
you
sail
right
above
all
their
feelings
and
ideas
it
served
you
right
i
declare
what
earthly
right
had
you
to
go
sailing
down
on
people
in
that
majestic
fashion
and
asking
questions
as
if
they
were
roman
catholics
and
you
were
the
priest
i
do
see
what
in
the
world
you
mean
ruth
said
feeling
exceedingly
annoyed
well
my
dear
young
woman
you
ought
to
see
you
ca
expect
to
get
through
the
christian
world
even
without
having
a
due
regard
for
common
sense
just
suppose
the
president
wife
should
come
sweeping
into
your
parlor
asking
you
if
you
went
to
church
and
if
you
would
have
a
tract
i
am
afraid
you
would
be
tempted
to
tell
her
it
was
none
of
her
business
the
cases
are
not
at
all
parallel
ruth
said
flushing
deeply
i
consider
myself
on
quite
an
equal
footing
with
the
president
wife
or
any
other
lady
whereupon
marion
laughed
with
more
than
before
now
ruth
erskine
she
said
do
be
a
goose
do
use
your
common
sense
you
have
some
i
am
sure
wherein
are
these
people
whom
you
went
to
see
on
a
lower
footing
than
yourself
granting
that
they
have
less
money
than
you
do
or
even
perhaps
less
than
i
have
are
you
ready
to
admit
that
money
is
the
question
that
settles
positions
in
society

miss
wilbur
miss
wilbur
ca
we
go
in
miss
lily
class
our
teacher
is
here
miss
wilbur
they
are
crowding
us
off
the
seat
there
is
room
for
no
more
in
this
class
miss
wilbur
sister
nellie
ca
come
she
has
the
toothache
can
i
go
in
kitty
class
every
one
of
these
little
voices
spoke
at
once
two
of
the
owners
thereof
twitched
at
her
dress
and
another
of
them
nudged
her
elbow
in
the
midst
of
this
little
babel
of
confusion
the
door
opened
softly
and
dennis
came
in
marion
turned
toward
him
and
laughed
a
perplexed
laugh
that
might
mean
something
besides
amusement
what
is
it
he
asked
answering
the
look
instead
of
the
laugh
it
is
everything
she
said
quickly
you
must
stay
a
minute
dennis
we
are
not
in
company
trim
at
all
unless
you
will
do
the
work
we
ca
have
you
i
came
to
hear
not
to
work
he
said
smiling
and
at
the
same
time
looking
troubled
you
will
hear
very
little
that
will
interest
you
for
the
next
ten
minutes
at
least
though
i
do
know
but
you
would
better
stay
it
would
be
a
good
introduction
to
the
talk
that
i
want
to
have
with
you
early
in
the
week
i
am
coming
after
school
if
i
may
dennis
gave
the
assent
promptly
named
the
hour
that
he
would
be
at
leisure
and
went
away
wondering
what
they
were
accomplishing
in
the
primary
class
this
was
the
introduction
to
marion
talk
in
the
study
with
dennis
she
wasted
no
time
in
preliminaries
but
had
hardly
seated
herself
before
the
subject
on
her
mind
was
brought
forward
it
is
all
about
that
class
dennis
i
am
going
to
prove
a
failure
do
he
said
smiling
at
her
words
but
looking
his
disturbance
we
have
had
failures
enough
in
that
class
to
shipwreck
it
it
is
quite
time
we
had
a
change
for
the
better
what
is
the
trouble
the
trouble
is
we
do
nothing
of
our
time
is
occupied
in
getting
ready
to
do
and
even
then
we
ca
half
accomplish
it
then
we
do
stay
ready
and
have
to
begin
the
work
all
over
again
yesterday
for
instance
there
were
three
absences
among
the
teachers
that
means
confusion
for
each
of
those
teachers
have
seven
children
who
are
thus
thrown
loose
on
the
world
think
how
much
time
we
must
consume
in
getting
them
seated
somewhere
and
under
some
one
care
and
then
imagine
if
you
can
the
amount
of
time
that
they
consume
in
saying
teacher
does
do
so
she
does
what
is
the
reason
that
the
teachers
in
that
room
are
so
very
irregular
why
they
are
not
irregular
that
is
as
teachers
rate
regularity
to
be
sure
it
would
never
do
to
be
teaching
a
graded
school
for
instance
and
be
as
careless
as
some
of
them
are
about
regularity
but
that
is
a
different
matter
of
course
this
is
only
a
but
for
all
that
i
think
they
do
as
well
as
the
average
you
see
dennis
there
are
twenty
of
them
and
if
each
one
of
them
is
present
every
sunday
in
the
year
save
three
that
makes
a
good
deal
of
regularity
on
their
part
and
yet
averages
absences
every
sabbath
to
be
looked
after
do
you
see
i
see
he
said
smiling
that
is
a
mathematical
way
of
putting
it
there
is
reason
in
it
too
how
in
the
world
do
you
manage
when
there
are
vacancies
which
is
always
marion
said
quickly
there
has
not
been
a
sabbath
since
i
have
had
charge
when
all
the
teachers
were
present
and
i
have
taken
pains
to
inquire
of
the
former
superintendent
who
reports
very
much
the
same
is
it
so
in
all
schools
dr
dennis
of
course
there
must
of
necessity
be
some
detentions
but
not
so
many
probably
as
there
actually
are
if
we
were
in
the
habit
of
being
very
conscientious
about
these
matters
still
i
do
know
that
we
are
worse
than
others
but
you
have
told
me
how
you
manage
i
manage
every
way
there
is
no
set
way
to
do
it
i
stand
around
in
much
the
same
state
of
perplexity
in
which
you
found
me
yesterday
the
children
each
have
their
special
friends
who
have
been
put
in
other
classes
and
they
are
on
the
to
be
with
them
which
adds
not
a
little
to
the
general
confusion
sometimes
we
have
a
regular
whirl
about
of
seats
enlarge
two
or
three
classes
and
crowd
some
seats
most
uncomfortably
leaving
others
empty
sometimes
we
go
out
to
the
for
volunteers
and
by
the
way
it
is
nearly
impossible
to
find
any
i
wish
you
would
preach
a
sermon
on
that
subject
it
is
so
easy
to
say
please
excuse
me
it
requires
so
little
courage
to
do
it
and
is
such
a
comfortable
and
unanswerable
way
of
disposing
of
the
whole
matter
at
the
same
time
there
is
some
degree
of
excuse
for
the
refusals
think
of
the
folly
of
setting
a
young
girl
who
knows
nothing
about
little
children
and
has
made
no
preparation
to
teach
them
beside
half
a
dozen
little
restless
mortals
and
bidding
her
interest
them
in
the
lesson
for
ten
minutes
she
does
know
how
to
interest
them
and
she
knows
she
does
and
the
fact
embarrasses
her
before
she
has
fairly
found
out
what
she
is
expected
to
do
her
time
is
gone
for
it
takes
a
wonderful
amount
of
time
to
get
ready
to
work
but
these
young
girls
have
only
to
teach
certain
scripture
verses
and
a
prayer
or
a
hymn
or
something
of
that
sort
have
they
not
one
would
think
they
might
be
equal
to
that
without
preparation
do
you
think
so
marion
asked
a
gleam
of
fun
in
her
keen
eyes
i
should
like
to
see
you
try
it
provided
you
have
no
better
mental
caliber
to
assist
you
than
some
of
the
volunteers
have
why
there
is
a
right
and
wrong
way
of
teaching
even
a
bible
verse
do
you
know
sir
that
you
may
repeat
over
words
to
children
like
a
list
from
a
spelling
lesson
and
they
will
get
no
more
idea
from
it
than
if
it
were
a
french
sentence
and
will
be
able
to
commit
it
about
as
readily
if
i
had
children
i
should
rebel
at
their
being
taught
even
bible
verses
by
novices
why
it
is
allowed
in
public
schools
the
days
have
gone
by
when
anybody
is
supposed
to
be
smart
enough
to
teach
children
to
drawl
through
the
alphabet
we
have
the
best
of
trained
teachers
even
for
that
work
why
should
the
not
need
them
even
more
infinitely
more
now
that
reminds
me
of
a
difficulty
which
is
present
even
when
the
teachers
are
all
there
they
are
not
the
right
sort
of
teachers
many
of
them
they
do
just
such
work
as
would
not
be
tolerated
on
by
any
board
of
trustees
they
whisper
to
each
other
sometimes
about
the
music
which
they
are
practicing
sometimes
about
the
party
that
is
to
come
off
these
are
the
exceptions
i
know
but
there
are
such
exceptions
in
our
school
and
human
nature
is
much
the
same
the
world
over
i
presume
they
are
everywhere
at
any
rate
we
have
to
deal
just
now
with
school
and
i
know
they
are
there
dennis
there
are
at
least
seven
of
those
twenty
teachers
in
my
room
who
ought
to
be
in
good
solid
earnest
working
bible
classes
getting
faith
for
help
every
sunday
getting
ideas
that
shall
make
them
of
use
in
the
world
instead
of
frittering
their
time
away
on
what
at
best
seems
to
them
but
a
very
mechanical
work
teaching
some
little
children
to
repeat
the
psalm
or
to
say
the
lord
prayer
the
very
fact
that
they
do
not
recognize
the
dignity
of
such
work
unfits
them
for
it
and
the
fact
that
they
have
no
lesson
to
teach
i
mean
no
lesson
which
they
have
to
prepare
carefully
excuses
them
from
any
attempt
at
bible
study
i
believe
you
would
make
an
excellent
lecturer
if
you
were
to
take
the
field
on
a
subject
that
interested
you
this
was
dennis
most
irrelevant
answer
to
marion
eager
words
she
was
not
to
be
thrown
off
her
theme
then
i
shall
try
it
perhaps
on
this
very
subject
for
it
certainly
interests
me
wonderfully
indeed
i
am
practicing
now
with
you
for
my
audience
do
think
i
am
not
interested
for
i
am
he
said
returning
to
gravity
and
anxiety
on
the
instant
i
see
the
subject
to
be
full
of
perplexities
the
class
has
seemed
a
bewildering
one
the
idea
of
putting
the
babies
away
alone
in
their
own
room
fitted
up
for
the
purpose
and
feeding
them
with
milk
until
they
are
old
enough
to
bear
strong
meat
has
been
something
of
a
hobby
with
me
i
like
it
theoretically
but
i
confess
to
you
that
i
have
never
been
able
to
enjoy
its
practical
workings
in
our
school
i
do
wonder
marion
said
with
energy
it
works
most
distressingly
i
am
coming
to
the
very
pith
of
my
lecture
now
which
is
this
i
have
been
teaching
school
for
more
than
seven
years
i
have
taught
all
sorts
and
sizes
of
pupils
i
had
a
fancy
that
i
could
manage
almost
anything
in
that
line
believing
that
i
had
been
through
experiences
varied
enough
to
serve
me
in
whatever
line
i
could
need
but
i
have
found
myself
mistaken
i
have
found
a
work
now
that
i
accomplish
mind
you
i
do
say
that
no
one
can
do
it
i
am
not
quite
so
egotistic
as
that
if
i
do
lecture
i
have
only
to
say
that
my
teaching
in
that
room
is
a
failure
i
ca
do
it
and
i
mean
to
give
it
up
do
dennis
said
nervously
you
will
be
the
third
one
in
a
year
time
i
do
wonder
i
wonder
that
they
are
alive
but
miss
wilbur
you
are
a
dark
and
gloomy
lecturer
when
you
demolish
air
castles
have
you
nothing
to
build
up
in
their
places
would
you
send
the
babies
back
into
the
main
room
again
to
be
worn
out
with
quiet
and
lack
of
motion
not
a
bit
of
it
i
like
the
plan
as
well
as
any
mortal
and
i
have
a
remedy
which
it
seems
to
me
would
arrange
the
whole
thing
of
course
it
seems
so
to
me
we
always
like
our
own
ways
the
truth
is
dennis
i
like
nurseries
and
think
they
ought
to
be
maintained
but
i
do
like
the
idea
of
too
many
mothers
there
just
what
in
plain
english
would
you
do
my
friend
if
you
were
of
the
whole
matter
and
all
we
had
to
do
was
to
obey
you
it
is
at
all
modest
to
tell
marion
said
laughing
but
it
is
true
i
would
banish
every
one
of
those
twenty
teachers
and
reign
alone
in
my
glory
no
i
would
either
i
would
pick
out
the
very
best
one
among
them
and
train
her
for
an
assistant
and
manage
the
whole
number
yourself
why
not
there
are
only
a
hundred
of
them
and
i
have
managed
that
number
for
six
hours
a
day
five
days
in
a
week
without
difficulty
well
now
let
me
see
just
what
you
think
you
gain
it
would
take
too
long
to
tell
in
my
own
opinion
i
gain
almost
everything
but
in
the
first
place
let
me
suppose
a
case
we
have
one
good
teacher
we
will
say
in
that
class
who
knows
just
what
she
is
about
and
comes
prepared
to
be
about
it
she
has
say
two
assistants
each
carefully
trained
to
a
certain
work
each
understanding
that
in
the
event
of
the
detention
of
the
leader
one
of
them
will
be
called
on
to
teach
the
class
each
pledging
herself
to
notify
the
other
of
necessary
absences
do
you
see
that
it
will
rarely
if
ever
happen
that
one
of
the
three
can
not
be
at
her
post
the
very
sense
of
importance
and
responsibility
attached
to
their
office
will
lessen
the
chance
of
absence
while
one
teacher
in
twenty
is
almost
sure
to
be
away
then
we
have
those
young
girls
in
their
places
in
the
bible
class
learning
to
be
teachers
indeed
but
miss
wilbur
would
not
such
a
work
be
very
hard
for
the
leader
why
harder
than
the
present
system
in
our
school
i
think
mind
you
that
it
would
be
nearly
so
hard
but
for
the
sake
of
the
argument
i
will
say
why
any
harder
why
can
not
her
one
assistant
relieve
her
in
just
the
same
way
that
the
other
twenty
are
supposed
to
do
now
is
there
any
known
reason
why
a
hundred
children
can
not
repeat
the
lord
prayer
together
as
well
as
have
a
lesson
taught
them
together
children
like
it
i
assure
you
there
is
an
enthusiasm
in
numbers
they
would
much
rather
speak
aloud
and
in
beautiful
unison
as
they
can
be
trained
to
do
than
to
speak
so
low
that
the
recitation
loses
half
its
beauty
because
they
must
not
disturb
others
then
i
do
know
how
it
is
with
other
teachers
but
theoretically
you
may
plan
out
the
work
of
these
young
teachers
as
much
as
you
please
and
practically
they
will
do
very
much
as
they
please
and
it
is
a
great
deal
harder
for
me
to
sit
listening
to
a
sort
of
teaching
that
i
do
like
and
know
that
i
am
obliged
to
be
still
and
endure
it
than
it
is
to
do
it
myself
the
idea
that
one
hour
of
work
on
the
sabbath
is
so
fearfully
wearing
is
in
my
humble
opinion
all
nonsense
those
who
think
so
have
never
been
teachers
of
graded
schools
six
hours
a
day
five
days
in
the
week
i
do
believe
however
that
is
my
opinion
you
know
i
may
be
quite
mistaken
as
to
theory
but
i
know
as
much
as
this
i
am
sure
i
could
do
the
teaching
alone
and
i
am
sure
that
i
ca
do
it
with
twenty
helpers
so
i
just
want
to
give
it
up
do
give
up
the
subject
yet
please
i
am
interested
there
is
an
argument
on
the
other
side
that
is
very
strong
i
think
you
touched
upon
it
i
have
heard
a
good
deal
said
and
thought
it
a
point
well
taken
about
the
personal
influence
of
each
teacher
a
sense
of
ownership
that
teachers
of
large
classes
can
hardly
call
out
because
of
their
inability
to
visit
their
scholars
and
to
be
intimate
with
their
little
plans
and
with
their
home
life
marion
did
a
very
rude
thing
at
this
point
she
sat
back
in
her
and
laughed
then
she
said
we
are
dealing
you
remember
with
our
school
now
you
know
the
young
ladies
in
that
class
what
proportion
of
them
should
you
imagine
without
knowing
anything
about
the
facts
do
really
visit
their
pupils
during
the
week
and
keep
themselves
posted
as
to
the
family
life
of
any
of
them
a
faint
attempt
at
a
smile
hovered
over
dennis
face
as
he
said
not
many
i
am
afraid
indeed
to
be
very
truthful
i
do
believe
there
are
five
i
know
there
are
not
marion
said
decidedly
and
my
supposition
is
that
our
school
will
average
as
well
as
others
there
are
exceptions
of
course
but
we
are
talking
about
the
average
now
that
item
sounds
real
well
in
a
lecture
or
on
paper
but
when
you
come
to
the
practical
part
they
simply
do
it
some
of
them
know
no
more
how
to
do
it
than
kittens
would
or
than
ruth
erskine
knows
how
to
call
on
the
second
stratum
of
society
in
her
own
church
whereupon
both
pastor
and
visitor
laughed
dennis
had
heard
of
ruth
attempt
in
that
line
we
have
to
deal
with
very
human
beings
instead
of
with
angels
i
think
that
is
the
trouble
marion
said
returning
to
the
charge
we
can
make
nice
rules
and
they
look
well
and
sound
beautifully
then
if
we
can
carry
them
out
they
are
delightful
no
doubt
but
if
we
ca
why
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
it
if
the
ladies
in
question
were
salaried
teachers
in
the
a
board
of
trustees
could
come
together
and
dismiss
them
if
they
did
not
obey
the
laws
who
thinks
of
such
a
thing
in
the
it
is
like
calling
all
these
teachers
together
for
a
teachers
meeting
you
can
them
to
your
heart
content
i
know
you
can
for
i
have
tried
it
and
if
there
is
not
a
concert
or
a
or
a
lecture
or
a
toothache
on
the
evening
in
question
some
of
them
will
come
and
the
others

theory
versus
practice
dennis
sat
regarding
his
caller
with
a
thoughtful
air
while
she
sat
back
in
the
rocker
and
fanned
herself
trying
to
cool
off
her
eagerness
somewhat
and
feeling
that
she
was
exhibiting
herself
as
a
very
eager
person
indeed
and
this
calm
man
probably
thought
her
impetuous
she
resolved
that
the
next
remark
he
called
forth
should
be
made
very
quietly
and
in
as
indifferent
a
manner
as
possible
why
should
not
the
primary
room
be
classified
as
well
as
the
main
department
he
asked
at
last
to
marion
there
was
so
much
that
was
absurd
involved
in
the
question
that
it
put
her
indifference
to
flight
at
once
why
should
there
be
a
separate
room
at
all
if
they
are
to
be
so
classified
why
not
keep
them
in
the
regular
department
under
the
superintendent
eye
and
where
they
can
have
the
benefit
of
the
pastor
remarks
because
while
they
are
so
young
they
need
more
freedom
than
can
be
given
them
in
the
main
room
they
need
to
be
allowed
to
talk
aloud
and
to
sing
frequently
and
to
repeat
in
concert
precisely
and
they
do
not
need
to
be
set
down
in
corners
to
be
whispered
at
for
a
few
minutes
besides
dennis
do
you
think
that
if
in
the
school
proper
the
scholars
were
all
of
nearly
the
same
age
and
the
same
mental
abilities
i
mean
if
they
averaged
in
that
way
it
would
be
wiser
to
have
very
large
classes
and
very
few
teachers
there
are
reasons
in
favor
of
that
and
reasons
against
it
he
said
thoughtfully
i
am
inclined
however
to
think
that
the
arguments
in
favor
overbalance
the
objections
still
the
serious
objection
is
that
a
faithful
teacher
wants
little
personal
talks
with
her
pupils
and
will
contrive
to
be
personal
in
a
way
that
she
can
not
do
so
well
in
a
large
class
that
is
true
marion
said
as
one
yields
a
point
that
is
new
to
her
and
that
strikes
her
as
being
sensible
but
the
same
objection
can
not
be
made
in
the
primary
classes
because
little
children
are
innocent
and
full
of
faith
and
frankness
there
is
no
need
of
special
privacy
when
you
talk
with
them
on
religious
topics
they
would
just
as
soon
have
all
the
world
know
that
they
want
to
love
and
serve
jesus
as
not
they
are
not
a
bit
ashamed
of
it
it
is
not
until
they
grow
older
and
the
influences
of
silent
tongues
on
that
subject
all
around
them
have
had
their
effect
that
they
need
to
be
approached
with
such
caution
how
is
it
that
you
are
so
much
at
home
in
these
matters
miss
wilbur
for
one
who
has
been
a
christian
but
a
few
weeks
you
amaze
me
marion
laughed
and
flushed
and
felt
the
first
tinge
of
embarrassment
that
had
troubled
her
since
the
talk
began
why
she
said
hesitatingly
i
suppose
perhaps
i
have
common
sense
and
see
no
reason
why
it
should
be
smothered
when
one
is
talking
about
such
matters
people
brains
are
not
made
over
when
they
are
converted
the
same
class
of
rules
apply
to
them
i
suppose
that
applied
before
i
should
wonder
if
a
majority
of
people
thought
that
common
sense
had
nothing
to
do
with
religion
he
said
laughing
and
that
is
what
makes
us
silly
and
sentimental
when
we
try
to
talk
about
it
in
our
effort
to
be
solemn
and
suit
our
words
to
the
theme
we
are
unnatural
but
your
statement
with
regard
to
the
little
children
is
true
i
have
often
observed
it
that
other
point
about
visiting
was
the
one
that
troubled
me
marion
said
it
does
annihilate
it
to
say
that
teachers
do
visit
they
do
to
be
sure
with
here
and
there
a
delightful
exception
my
experience
on
this
matter
as
well
as
on
several
other
matters
connected
with
the
subject
reaches
beyond
these
few
weeks
of
personal
experience
i
have
had
my
eyes
very
wide
open
i
was
alive
to
inconsistencies
wherever
i
found
them
the
world
and
the
church
and
especially
the
seemed
to
me
to
be
full
of
professions
without
any
practice
i
rather
enjoyed
finding
such
flaws
why
i
thought
the
thin
spots
in
other
people
garments
would
keep
me
any
warmer
i
am
sure
i
do
know
but
i
was
fond
of
bringing
them
to
the
surface
still
because
a
duty
is
done
is
no
sign
that
it
can
not
be
of
course
a
teacher
with
six
pupils
could
visit
them
frequently
while
one
with
a
hundred
could
do
it
but
rarely
and
yet
systematic
effort
would
accomplish
a
great
deal
in
that
direction
it
seems
to
me
i
do
know
why
we
should
have
more
than
fifty
people
in
our
churches
certainly
the
pastor
could
visit
them
much
more
frequently
and
keep
a
better
oversight
than
when
he
had
eight
hundred
as
you
have
yet
we
think
it
the
best
way
after
all
we
recognize
the
enthusiasm
of
numbers
and
the
necessity
for
economizing
good
workers
so
long
as
the
field
for
work
is
so
large
but
i
know
a
way
in
which
a
strong
personal
influence
could
be
kept
over
even
a
hundred
children
by
keeping
watch
for
the
sick
and
sorrowing
in
their
homes
and
establishing
an
intimacy
there
and
by
making
a
gathering
of
some
sort
say
twice
a
year
or
oftener
if
a
person
could
and
giving
the
day
to
them
and
well
in
a
hundred
different
ways
that
i
will
not
take
your
time
to
speak
of
only
we
teachers
of
know
that
we
can
make
our
influence
far
reaching
even
when
our
numbers
are
large
and
we
know
that
there
is
such
an
influence
in
numbers
and
in
disciplined
action
that
other
things
being
equal
we
can
teach
mathematics
to
a
class
of
fifty
better
than
we
can
to
a
class
of
five
and
if
mathematics
why
not
the
prayer
now
i
have
relieved
my
mind
on
this
subject
she
added
laughing
as
she
arose
and
i
feel
a
good
deal
better
mind
i
have
said
at
all
that
the
present
system
can
not
be
carried
out
successfully
i
only
say
that
i
ca
do
it
i
have
tried
it
and
failed
it
is
not
according
to
my
way
of
working
but
the
remedy
my
dear
friend
in
our
class
for
instance
suppose
we
wanted
to
reorganize
what
would
we
do
with
the
teachers
in
rule
at
present
marion
dropped
back
again
into
her
chair
with
a
dismayed
little
laugh
and
an
expressive
shrug
of
her
shapely
shoulders
now
you
have
touched
a
vital
difficulty
she
said
i
do
pretend
to
be
able
to
help
people
out
of
a
scrape
like
that
having
gotten
themselves
in
they
must
get
out
the
best
way
they
can
if
there
any
way
i
am
surprised
that
you
do
not
suggest
that
they
be
unceremoniously
informed
that
their
services
are
not
needed
and
advise
them
to
join
a
bible
class
dennis
said
dryly
that
is
the
practical
and
helpful
way
that
the
subject
is
often
disposed
of
in
our
conventions
i
often
wonder
if
those
who
so
suggest
would
like
to
be
the
pastor
of
the
church
where
such
advice
was
adopted
and
undertake
to
heal
all
the
sores
that
would
be
the
result
so
long
as
human
nature
is
made
of
the
queer
stuff
that
it
is
i
offer
no
such
remedy
marion
said
decidedly
it
is
very
odd
that
the
people
who
do
the
least
work
in
this
world
are
the
most
sensitive
as
to
position
etc
no
i
see
the
trouble
in
the
way
it
could
be
partly
disposed
of
in
time
by
sending
all
these
out
into
the
other
school
and
organizing
a
new
primary
class
out
of
the
babies
who
have
not
yet
come
in
but
there
would
be
an
injustice
there
it
would
send
out
many
babies
who
ought
to
have
the
privileges
of
the
for
some
time
yet
and
there
is
another
difficulty
it
would
send
out
those
young
girls
as
teachers
of
the
children
and
they
are
not
fit
to
teach
they
should
be
studying
after
all
he
said
going
back
to
his
own
thoughts
instead
of
answering
her
last
remark
would
the
style
of
teaching
that
you
suggest
for
this
one
woman
and
her
assistant
involve
an
unusual
degree
of
talent
and
consecration
and
abnegation
yes
marion
said
quickly
and
earnestly
i
think
it
would
and
i
believe
that
there
is
no
teaching
done
in
our
that
is
worthy
of
the
name
that
does
not
involve
all
of
these
requirements
especially
is
it
the
case
in
teaching
little
children
divine
truths
one
might
teach
them
the
alphabet
without
positive
mental
injury
if
they
were
not
fully
in
sympathy
yet
i
doubt
that
but
one
can
not
teach
the
sermon
on
the
mount
in
a
way
to
reach
the
unless
one
is
thoroughly
and
solemnly
in
earnest
and
loves
the
souls
of
the
little
children
so
much
that
she
can
give
up
her
very
self
for
them
this
is
my
theory
i
want
to
work
toward
it
that
is
one
of
the
strong
reasons
why
i
think
two
or
three
teachers
are
better
for
a
primary
class
than
twenty
because
a
church
can
generally
furnish
that
number
of
really
consecrated
workers
that
she
can
spare
for
the
primary
class
while
to
find
twenty
who
can
be
spared
for
that
room
one
would
need
to
go
to
paradise
i
am
afraid
now
i
know
dennis
that
such
talk
sounds
as
if
i
were
insufferably
conceited
but
i
do
believe
i
am
i
simply
know
what
i
am
willing
to
try
to
do
and
to
a
certain
extent
i
know
what
i
do
why
should
i
not
i
have
tried
it
a
long
time
if
you
are
conceited
dennis
said
smiling
it
is
a
real
refreshing
form
for
it
to
appear
in
i
am
almost
a
convert
to
your
theory
at
least
so
far
as
i
need
converting
if
i
should
tell
you
that
something
like
your
idea
has
always
been
mine
you
would
not
consider
me
a
hypocrite
would
you
if
you
think
so
why
have
we
the
present
system
in
our
school
my
dear
friend
i
did
not
manufacture
the
school
it
is
as
i
found
it
and
there
are
those
young
ladies
who
however
unfaithful
they
are
and
a
few
of
them
are
just
that
do
not
reach
the
only
point
where
they
could
give
positive
help
that
of
resigning
and
giving
us
a
chance
to
do
better
besides
they
are
as
you
say
sensitive
they
do
not
like
to
be
called
to
account
for
occasional
absences
in
fact
they
do
not
like
being
controlled
in
any
way
that
is
one
of
the
marked
difficulties
marion
said
eagerly
now
i
have
heard
people
talk
who
led
you
to
infer
that
it
was
the
easiest
thing
in
life
to
mold
these
young
teachers
into
the
required
shape
and
form
that
you
had
only
to
sweetly
suggest
and
advise
and
direct
and
they
sweetly
succumbed
now
do
their
mothers
know
that
young
ladies
naturally
do
no
such
thing
it
is
very
difficult
for
them
to
yield
their
opinions
to
one
whose
authority
they
do
not
recognize
and
they
are
not
fond
of
admitting
authority
even
where
family
life
sanctions
it
oh
the
whole
subject
is
just
teeming
with
difficulties
put
it
in
any
form
you
will
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
mistake
where
you
give
these
young
ladies
the
lesson
to
teach
the
diverse
minds
that
are
brought
to
bear
on
it
make
it
almost
impossible
for
the
leader
to
give
an
intelligent
summing
up
how
is
she
to
discover
what
special
point
has
been
taken
up
by
each
teacher
as
a
bit
of
private
experience
i
think
she
will
be
a
fortunate
woman
if
she
finds
that
point
at
all
has
been
reached
in
many
of
the
classes
there
is
only
now
and
then
a
teacher
who
believes
that
little
children
are
capable
of
understanding
the
application
of
a
story
i
understand
why
if
that
is
the
best
method
of
managing
a
primary
class
people
take
the
trouble
to
have
a
separate
room
and
another
superintendent
why
do
they
stay
in
the
main
department
i
always
thought
that
one
of
the
special
values
of
a
separate
room
was
that
the
lesson
may
be
given
in
a
distinct
and
natural
tone
of
voice
and
with
illustrations
and
accompaniments
that
can
not
be
used
where
many
classes
are
together
without
disturbing
some
of
them
if
on
the
other
hand
the
are
not
expected
to
give
the
lesson
but
only
to
teach
certain
opening
recitations
then
you
have
the
spectacle
of
employing
a
dozen
or
twenty
persons
to
do
the
work
of
one
then
there
another
thing
our
room
is
not
suited
to
the
plan
of
subdivision
and
there
is
only
occasionally
a
room
that
has
been
built
to
order
which
is
on
the
whole
you
do
not
at
all
believe
in
the
plan
of
subdivision
dennis
said
laughing
and
then
callers
came
and
marion
took
her
leave
i
am
not
quite
sure
whether
i
like
him
or
dislike
him
or
whether
i
am
afraid
of
him
just
a
trifle
this
she
said
to
the
girls
as
they
went
home
from
he
has
a
queer
way
of
branching
off
from
the
subject
entirely
just
when
you
suppose
that
you
have
interested
him
sometimes
he
interrupts
with
a
sentence
that
sounds
wonderfully
as
if
he
might
be
quizzing
you
he
is
a
trifle
queer
anyway
i
do
believe
i
love
him
with
all
the
zeal
that
a
person
should
bestow
on
a
pastor
i
am
loyal
on
that
subject
theoretically
but
practically
i
stand
in
awe
i
do
see
how
you
can
think
him
sarcastic
flossy
said
there
is
not
the
least
tinge
of
that
element
in
his
nature
i
think
at
least
i
have
never
seen
it
i
do
feel
afraid
of
him
either
once
i
thought
i
should
but
he
is
so
gentle
and
pleasant
and
meets
one
half
way
and
understands
what
one
wants
to
tell
better
than
they
understand
themselves
oh
i
like
him
ever
so
much
he
is
not
sarcastic
to
me
marion
looked
down
upon
the
fair
little
girl
at
her
side
with
a
smile
that
had
a
sort
of
almost
motherly
tenderness
in
it
as
she
said
gently
one
would
be
a
very
bear
to
think
of
quizzing
a
you
know
it
would
be
very
silly
in
him
to
be
sarcastic
to
you
eurie
interrupted
the
talk
what
is
the
matter
with
the
she
asked
do
any
of
you
know
i
do
wish
we
could
do
something
to
make
them
less
forlorn
i
am
almost
homesick
every
time
i
go
if
there
were
more
people
there
the
room
would
look
so
desolate
why
on
earth
do
the
people
come
constitutionally
opposed
to
or
it
is
too
warm
or
too
damp
or
too
something
for
most
of
them
to
go
out
marion
said
and
ruth
added
it
is
not
wonderful
that
you
find
sarcastic
people
in
the
world
marion
the
habit
grows
on
you
does
it
marion
asked
speaking
with
sadness
i
am
sorry
to
hear
that
i
really
thought
i
was
improving
the
question
is
can
we
do
anything
to
improve
matters
eurie
said
ca
we
manage
to
smuggle
some
more
people
into
that
chapel
on
wednesday
evenings
invite
them
to
go
do
you
mean
flossy
said
and
her
eyes
brightened
i
never
thought
of
that
we
might
get
our
friends
to
go
who
knows
what
good
might
be
done
in
that
way
what
if
we
try
it
ruth
looked
gloomy
this
way
of
working
was
wonderfully
distasteful
to
her
she
specially
disliked
what
she
called
thrusting
unpopular
subjects
on
people
attention
but
she
reflected
that
she
had
never
yet
found
a
way
to
work
which
she
did
like
so
she
was
silent
flossy
according
to
her
usual
custom
persistently
followed
up
the
new
idea
let
us
try
it
she
said
suppose
we
pledge
ourselves
each
to
bring
another
to
the
meeting
next
week
if
we
can
marion
said
significantly
well
of
course
some
of
us
can
eurie
answered
you
ought
to
be
able
to
anyway
there
you
are
in
a
surrounded
by
hundreds
of
people
who
ought
to
go
and
in
a
coming
in
contact
with
dozens
of
another
stamp
who
are
in
equal
need
i
should
think
you
had
opportunities
enough
i
know
it
marion
said
promptly
if
i
were
only
situated
as
you
are
with
nobody
but
a
father
and
mother
and
a
brother
and
a
couple
of
sisters
to
ask
people
who
are
of
no
special
consequence
to
you
and
about
whom
it
will
make
no
personal
difference
to
you
whether
they
go
to
church
or
not
it
would
be
some
excuse
for
not
bringing
anybody
but
a
full
of
men
and
women
and
a
room
full
of
school
girls
consider
your
privileges
marion
wilbur
eurie
laughed
oh
i
can
get
nell
to
go
she
said
he
nearly
always
does
what
i
want
him
to
but
i
was
thinking
how
many
you
have
to
work
among
six
people
are
as
good
to
work
among
as
sixty
until
you
get
them
all
marion
answered
quickly
as
for
ruth
it
was
only
the
darkness
that
hid
her
curling
lip
she
someway
could
not
help
disliking
people
who
like
nellis
mitchell
always
did
what
they
were
asked
to
do
just
to
oblige
also
she
dreaded
this
new
plan
she
had
no
one
to
ask
no
one
to
influence
so
she
said
to
herself
gloomily
although
knowing
that
it
was
untrue
she
did
not
venture
to
say
it
aloud
she
gave
consent
of
course
to
the
proposition
to
try
by
personal
effort
to
increase
the
number
at
it
would
be
absurd
to
object
to
it
she
did
not
care
to
own
that
she
shrunk
from
personal
effort
of
this
sort
it
was
a
grief
to
her
very
soul
that
she
did
so
shrink
remember
we
stand
pledged
to
try
for
one
new
face
at
the
eurie
said
as
she
bade
them
good
night
pledged
to
you
understand
marion
we
can
at
least
do
that
even
if
we
succeed
in
the
meantime
remember
that
we
have
our
bible
evening
marion
returned
you
are
to
come
bristling
with
texts
from
your
standpoint
it
will
not
do
to
forget
that
illustration
illustration
chapter
xvii
the
discussion
marion
went
about
her
dingy
room
brushing
off
a
bit
of
dust
here
setting
a
chair
straight
there
trying
in
what
ways
she
might
to
brighten
its
homeliness
she
was
a
trifle
sore
sometimes
over
the
contrast
between
that
room
and
the
homes
of
her
three
friends
sometimes
she
thought
it
a
wonder
that
they
could
endure
to
leave
the
brightness
and
cheer
that
surrounded
their
home
lives
and
seek
her
out
there
were
times
when
she
was
very
much
tempted
to
spend
a
large
portion
of
her
not
too
large
salary
in
bestowing
little
things
on
this
corner
of
the
a
a
lounge
a
tiny
instead
of
the
square
thing
that
she
had
not
very
extravagant
her
notions
were
just
a
suggestion
of
comfort
and
a
touch
of
brightness
for
her
eyes
to
dwell
on
but
these
home
things
and
these
bright
things
cost
money
more
money
than
she
felt
at
liberty
to
spend
when
her
necessary
expenses
of
books
and
dress
and
a
dozen
apparently
trifling
incidentals
were
met
there
was
little
enough
left
to
send
to
that
struggling
uncle
and
aunt
who
needed
her
help
sadly
enough
and
who
had
shared
their
little
with
her
in
earlier
days
there
was
no
special
love
about
this
offering
of
hers
it
was
just
a
matter
of
hard
duty
they
had
taken
care
of
her
in
her
orphanhood
a
grave
preoccupied
sort
of
care
bestowing
little
time
and
no
love
on
her
that
she
could
discover
at
the
same
time
they
had
never
either
of
them
been
unkind
and
they
had
fed
and
clothed
her
and
never
said
in
her
presence
that
they
grudged
it
they
had
never
asked
her
for
any
return
never
seemed
to
expect
any
and
they
were
regularly
surprised
every
half
year
when
the
remittance
came
but
so
far
as
that
was
concerned
marion
did
not
know
it
they
were
a
very
undemonstrative
people
uncle
reuben
had
told
her
once
that
she
need
not
do
it
that
they
had
not
expected
it
of
her
and
aunt
hannah
had
added
no
more
they
did
but
marion
had
hushed
them
both
by
a
decided
sentence
to
the
effect
that
it
was
nothing
more
than
ordinary
justice
and
decency
and
she
did
not
know
even
now
that
the
gratitude
they
might
have
expressed
was
hushed
back
by
her
cold
words
still
the
remittances
always
went
it
had
required
some
special
scrimping
to
make
the
check
the
same
as
usual
and
yet
bring
in
chautauqua
it
had
been
delayed
beyond
its
usual
time
by
these
new
departures
and
it
was
on
this
particular
evening
that
she
was
getting
it
ready
for
the
mail
for
seven
years
twice
a
year
she
had
regularly
written
her
note
aunt
hannah
i
inclose
in
this
letter
a
check
for
i
hope
you
are
as
well
as
usual
in
haste
wilbur
this
or
a
kindred
sentence
as
brief
and
as
much
to
the
point
her
fingers
had
played
with
the
pen
instead
of
writing
and
at
last
with
a
curious
smile
hovering
around
her
lip
she
wrote
the
unaccustomed
words
dear
aunt
it
would
have
taken
very
little
to
have
made
the
smile
into
a
quiver
it
seemed
just
then
so
strange
that
she
should
have
no
one
to
write
that
word
dear
to
that
she
should
use
it
so
rarely
that
it
actually
looked
like
a
stranger
to
her
then
the
writing
went
on
thus
i
hope
i
have
not
caused
you
discomfort
by
being
somewhat
later
than
usual
with
your
check
matters
shaped
themselves
in
such
a
way
that
i
could
not
send
it
before
i
hope
it
will
be
of
a
little
help
and
comfort
to
you
i
wish
it
were
larger
give
my
re
love
to
uncle
reuben
the
re
was
the
beginning
of
the
word
regards
but
she
thought
better
of
it
and
wrote
love
he
was
her
father
brother
and
the
only
relative
she
had
then
the
pen
paused
again
and
the
writer
gnawed
at
the
painted
holder
and
mused
and
looked
sober
first
then
and
finally
she
dashed
down
this
line
dear
aunt
hannah
i
have
found
my
friend
even
the
lord
jesus
christ
he
is
indeed
mighty
to
save
as
father
used
to
say
that
he
was
i
have
proved
it
for
he
has
saved
me
i
wish
you
and
uncle
reuben
knew
him
yours
truly
marion
i
suppose
marion
would
have
been
very
much
surprised
had
she
known
what
i
know
that
aunt
hannah
and
uncle
reuben
shed
tears
over
that
letter
and
put
it
in
the
family
bible
and
someway
they
felt
more
thankful
for
the
check
than
they
had
ever
done
before
marion
did
not
know
this
but
she
knew
that
her
own
heart
felt
lighter
than
usual
as
she
hurried
about
her
room
the
girls
came
before
she
was
fairly
through
with
her
preparations
a
bright
trio
with
enough
of
beauty
and
grace
and
elegance
about
them
to
fairly
make
her
room
glow
here
we
are
said
eurie
we
have
run
the
gauntlet
of
five
calls
and
a
concert
and
i
do
know
how
many
other
things
in
prospective
for
the
sake
of
getting
to
you
did
you
come
alone
no
my
blessed
nell
came
with
us
to
the
door
and
most
dreadfully
did
he
want
to
come
in
i
should
have
let
him
in
only
i
knew
by
ruth
face
she
thought
it
awful
but
he
would
have
enjoyed
the
evening
nell
does
enjoy
new
things
there
is
no
special
sensation
about
bible
verses
i
presume
they
would
have
palled
on
him
before
the
evening
was
over
this
was
said
in
coldest
tones
you
are
mistaken
in
that
my
lady
ruth
i
have
found
several
verses
in
my
search
that
have
given
me
a
real
sensation
besides
which
i
have
proved
my
side
beyond
the
shadow
of
a
reasonable
doubt
and
i
am
very
anxious
to
begin
marion
laughed
i
dare
say
we
have
each
proved
our
sides
to
our
entire
satisfaction
she
said
the
question
is
which
side
will
bear
the
test
of
our
combined
intellects
being
brought
to
bear
on
it
did
you
bring
your
bibles
girls
oh
yes
you
are
armed
flossy
your
bible
is
splendid
when
the
millennium
dawns
i
am
going
to
have
just
such
a
one
by
the
way
wo
that
be
a
blissful
time
do
you
want
to
live
to
see
it
eurie
inasmuch
as
you
are
so
anxious
to
begin
you
may
do
so
let
us
on
our
investigations
in
a
scientific
way
as
easton
says
give
us
your
argument
and
i
will
answer
it
with
my
unanswerable
one
on
the
other
side
then
if
ruth
can
prove
to
us
that
we
are
both
mistaken
and
each
can
follow
her
own
judgment
in
the
matter
we
will
be
quenched
you
see
unless
flossy
can
give
a
balancing
vote
well
in
the
first
place
eurie
said
i
found
to
my
infinite
astonishment
and
of
course
to
my
delight
that
the
bible
actually
stated
that
there
was
a
time
to
dance
now
if
there
is
a
time
for
it
of
course
it
is
the
proper
thing
to
do
that
just
settles
the
whole
question
how
absurd
it
would
be
to
put
in
the
bible
a
statement
that
there
was
a
time
to
dance
and
then
to
tell
us
that
it
was
wrong
to
dance
eurie
are
you
in
earnest
or
in
sport
marion
asked
at
last
looking
at
her
with
a
puzzled
air
and
not
sure
whether
to
laugh
or
be
disgusted
a
little
of
both
eurie
said
breaking
into
a
laugh
but
now
to
be
serious
there
really
is
such
a
verse
did
you
know
it
i
am
sure
i
did
i
was
very
much
astonished
and
i
think
it
does
prove
something
it
indicates
that
dancing
is
a
legitimate
amusement
and
one
that
was
indulged
in
during
those
times
do
you
advocate
its
use
under
the
same
circumstances
in
which
it
was
used
in
those
times
i
sure
i
do
know
was
there
anything
peculiar
in
its
use
did
you
follow
out
the
references
as
to
dancing
no
indeed
i
did
i
wish
i
had
does
it
give
an
account
of
it
that
would
have
been
better
yet
it
would
have
enlightened
you
somewhat
marion
said
laughing
if
you
had
been
on
the
other
side
now
you
would
have
been
sure
to
have
followed
out
the
connection
as
i
did
then
you
would
have
found
that
to
be
true
to
your
bible
you
must
dance
in
or
in
church
on
the
sabbath
or
at
some
time
when
you
desired
to
express
religious
joy
pooh
said
eurie
now
is
that
so
of
course
it
so
just
amuse
yourself
by
looking
up
the
references
to
the
word
in
the
concordance
and
i
will
read
them
for
our
enlightenment
well
said
eurie
after
several
readings
i
admit
that
i
am
rather
glad
that
form
of
worship
is
done
away
with
i
am
fond
of
dancing
but
i
do
care
to
indulge
when
i
go
to
but
after
all
that
does
prove
that
dancing
is
wrong
nor
right
ruth
said
questioningly
does
it
simply
prove
nothing
at
all
that
is
just
as
i
said
we
have
to
decide
these
questions
for
ourselves
but
eurie
did
you
content
yourself
with
just
one
text
i
thought
you
were
to
have
an
army
of
them
what
is
the
use
in
that
ruth
asked
one
text
is
as
good
as
a
dozen
if
it
proves
one
position
a
multitude
of
witnesses
marion
said
significantly
and
added
girls
ruth
has
but
one
text
in
support
of
her
position
see
if
she
has
well
i
have
another
said
eurie
the
wisest
man
who
ever
lived
said
merry
heart
doeth
good
like
a
medicine
now
i
am
sure
that
advocates
bright
cheerful
merry
times
just
such
as
one
has
in
dancing
and
there
are
dozens
of
such
verses
indicating
that
it
is
a
duty
we
owe
to
society
to
have
happy
and
merry
times
together
and
a
simpler
way
of
doing
it
than
any
i
know
is
to
dance
we
are
not
gossiping
nor
saying
censorious
things
when
we
are
dancing
and
we
are
having
a
very
pleasant
time
for
our
friends
any
merry
let
him
sing
psalms
quoted
marion
would
you
like
to
indulge
in
that
entertainment
at
the
same
time
you
were
dancing
or
do
you
think
the
same
state
of
mind
could
be
expressed
as
well
by
either
dancing
or
as
one
chose
eurie
mitchell
you
are
just
being
nonsensical
ruth
said
speaking
in
a
tone
you
are
not
absurd
enough
to
suppose
that
either
of
those
verses
are
arguments
in
favor
of
dancing
or
against
dancing
or
indeed
have
anything
to
do
with
the
subject
what
is
the
use
in
trying
to
make
people
think
you
are
a
simpleton
when
you
are
dreadful
said
eurie
is
that
what
i
doing
now
i
thought
i
was
proving
the
subtle
nature
of
my
argumentative
powers
see
here
i
will
be
as
sober
as
a
judge
no
i
do
think
those
verses
have
to
do
with
it
at
least
the
latter
has
i
admit
that
i
thought
the
fact
that
a
time
to
dance
was
mentioned
in
the
bible
was
an
item
in
its
favor
as
far
as
it
went
but
it
seems
i
should
rather
have
said
as
far
as
went
for
it
went
farther
as
marion
has
made
me
prove
with
that
dreadful
concordance
of
hers
we
do
own
such
a
terrible
book
as
that
and
i
have
to
go
skimming
over
the
whole
bible
in
a
distracting
manner
i
just
happened
on
the
verse
that
says
is
a
time
to
dance
and
i
know
but
there
might
be
a
special
providence
in
it
but
now
frankly
i
am
on
the
side
that
ruth
has
taken
it
seems
to
be
a
question
that
is
left
to
individual
judgment
there
is
no
saith
the
lord
about
it
any
more
than
there
is
about
having
company
and
going
out
to
tea
and
a
dozen
other
things
we
are
to
do
in
these
matters
what
we
think
is
right
and
that
in
my
opinion
is
all
there
is
about
it
then
you
retire
from
the
lists
marion
asked
not
a
bit
of
it
i
am
just
as
emphatically
of
the
opinion
that
there
is
no
harm
in
dancing
as
i
ever
was
what
i
say
is
that
the
bible
is
silent
on
that
subject
leaving
each
to
judge
for
herself
he
thinketh
in
his
heart
so
is
he
quoted
ruth
that
is
my
verse
one
of
them
and
i
think
it
is
unanswerable
if
you
marion
think
it
is
wicked
to
dance
then
you
would
be
doing
a
wrong
thing
to
dance
but
eurie
believing
it
to
be
right
and
proper
has
a
right
to
dance
each
person
as
he
thinks
in
his
heart
then
if
i
think
in
my
heart
that
it
is
right
to
go
skating
on
sunday
it
will
be
quite
right
for
me
to
go
is
that
the
reasoning
ruth
no
of
course
because
in
that
instance
you
have
the
direct
command
the
sabbath
day
to
keep
it
holy
but
who
is
going
to
prove
to
me
in
what
way
i
should
keep
it
holy
i
may
skate
with
very
good
thoughts
in
my
heart
and
feel
that
i
am
keeping
the
spirit
of
the
command
and
if
i
think
so
in
my
heart
why
is
it
so
you
know
it
is
a
parallel
case
ruth
said
slightly
nettled
flossy
would
you
speak
for
a
dollar
eurie
asked
suddenly
turning
to
her
she
had
been
utterly
grave
and
silent
during
all
this
war
of
words
but
to
judge
from
her
face
by
no
means
uninterested
she
shook
her
head
now
with
a
quiet
smile
i
know
what
i
think
she
said
but
i
do
want
to
speak
yet
only
i
want
to
know
ruth
about
that
verse
i
found
that
and
thought
about
it
i
could
see
that
it
means
what
you
think
it
does
i
used
to
think
in
my
very
heart
that
joining
the
church
and
trying
to
do
about
right
was
all
there
was
of
religion
but
i
have
found
that
i
was
wonderfully
mistaken
ca
persons
be
honest
and
yet
be
very
much
in
the
dark
because
they
have
not
informed
themselves
why
dear
me
said
marion
only
see
ruth
where
your
doctrine
would
lead
you
what
about
the
heathen
women
who
think
in
their
hearts
that
they
do
a
good
deed
when
they
give
their
babies
to
the
crocodiles
i
found
that
verse
about
paul
persecuting
all
who
called
on
the
name
of
jesus
and
he
says
he
verily
thought
he
was
doing
god
service
this
was
flossy
added
word
see
here
said
eurie
we
are
not
getting
at
it
at
all
i
have
any
verses
and
you
have
demolished
ruth
the
way
is
for
you
and
flossy
to
open
your
batteries
on
us
and
let
us
prove
to
you
that
they
do
any
of
them
mean
a
single
word
they
say
or
say
or
so
that
we
win
the
argument
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
earthly
harm
do
people
see
in
dancing
i
do
mean
of
course
going
to
balls
and
mingling
with
all
sorts
of
people
and
dancing
indecent
figures
i
mean
the
way
we
girls
have
been
in
the
habit
of
it
ruth
and
flossy
and
i
we
never
went
to
a
ball
in
our
lives
and
we
were
never
injured
by
dancing
so
far
as
i
can
discover
and
yet
we
have
done
a
good
deal
of
it
now
i
love
to
dance
it
is
the
very
pleasantest
amusement
i
can
think
of
and
yet
i
honestly
want
to
get
at
the
truth
of
this
matter
i
want
to
learn
i
do
in
the
least
know
why
churches
and
christians
think
such
dancing
is
wrong
i
could
find
a
thing
in
the
bible
that
showed
me
the
reason
to
be
sure
i
had
very
little
time
to
look
and
a
very
ignorant
brain
to
do
it
with
and
no
helps
but
i
am
ready
to
be
convinced
if
anybody
has
anything
that
will
convince
me
just
let
me
ask
you
a
question
marion
said
why
did
you
think
before
you
were
converted
that
it
was
wrong
for
christian
people
to
dance
how
do
you
know
i
did
asked
eurie
flushing
and
laughing
never
mind
how
i
know
though
you
must
have
forgotten
some
of
the
remarks
i
have
heard
you
make
about
others
to
ask
me
but
please
tell
me
honestly
then
i
do
know
and
it
is
that
thought
or
rather
that
remembrance
which
disturbs
me
now
i
had
a
feeling
that
someway
it
was
an
inconsistent
thing
to
do
and
that
if
i
was
converted
i
should
have
to
give
it
up
and
it
was
a
real
in
my
way
for
some
days
but
i
do
this
minute
know
a
single
definite
reason
why
i
in
common
with
the
rest
of
the
girls
and
the
young
men
in
our
set
felt
amused
whenever
we
saw
dancing
i
have
thought
perhaps
it
was
prejudice
or
a
misunderstanding
of
the
christian
life
illustration

chapter
xviii
the
result
now
what
i
want
said
marion
is
to
have
you
people
who
are
posted
answer
a
few
questions
you
know
i
am
not
a
dancer
i
have
only
stood
aside
and
looked
on
but
i
have
as
high
a
respect
for
common
sense
as
any
of
you
have
and
i
want
to
use
some
of
it
in
this
matter
so
just
tell
me
is
it
true
or
not
that
there
is
a
style
of
dancing
that
is
considered
improper
in
the
extreme
why
yes
of
course
there
is
eurie
said
quickly
is
it
the
style
that
is
indulged
in
at
our
ordinary
balls
where
all
sorts
of
characters
are
admitted
where
in
fact
anyone
who
can
buy
a
ticket
and
dress
well
is
welcome
you
know
you
were
particular
to
state
that
none
of
you
went
to
balls
are
these
some
of
the
reasons
principal
reason
is
ruth
said
with
an
upward
curve
of
her
haughty
lip
that
i
do
not
care
to
associate
with
all
sorts
of
people
either
in
the
or
anywhere
else
besides
which
you
are
reasonably
particular
who
of
your
acquaintances
have
the
privilege
of
frequently
clasping
your
hand
and
placing
an
arm
caressingly
around
your
waist
to
say
nothing
of
almost
carrying
you
through
the
room
are
you
not
ruth
turned
toward
the
questioner
flashing
eyes
while
she
said
that
is
very
unusual
language
to
address
to
us
marion
possibly
we
are
quite
as
in
our
feelings
as
yourself
oh
but
now
i
appeal
to
your
reason
and
common
sense
you
say
yourself
that
these
should
be
our
guide
is
it
true
that
you
as
a
dancer
allow
familiarity
that
you
would
consider
positively
insulting
under
other
circumstances
am
i
mistaken
in
your
opinion
as
to
the
proper
treatment
that
ladies
should
receive
from
gentlemen
at
all
other
times
save
when
they
are
dancing
it
a
solemn
fact
said
eurie
laughing
at
the
folly
of
her
position
that
the
man
with
whom
i
dance
has
a
privilege
that
if
he
should
undertake
to
assume
at
any
other
time
would
endanger
his
being
knocked
down
if
my
brother
nell
was
within
sight
and
it
is
true
that
there
are
lengths
to
which
dancers
go
that
you
would
not
permit
under
any
circumstances
undeniable
eurie
said
again
yet
i
do
see
what
that
proves
there
are
lengths
to
which
you
can
carry
almost
any
amusement
the
point
is
we
do
carry
them
to
any
such
lengths
that
is
the
whole
point
eurie
there
are
many
amusements
which
no
one
carries
to
improper
lengths
we
do
not
hear
of
their
being
so
perverted
but
we
do
not
hear
of
them
in
the
the
question
is
has
dancing
such
a
tendency
do
impure
people
have
which
it
is
a
shame
for
a
person
to
enter
are
young
men
and
young
women
our
brothers
and
sisters
led
astray
in
them
we
must
be
too
delicate
to
speak
on
these
things
for
they
exist
and
they
are
found
among
people
for
whom
the
lord
died
and
many
of
them
will
be
reclaimed
and
be
in
heaven
with
us
they
are
our
brethren
they
be
led
away
by
the
influences
of
the
dance
if
we
are
all
really
in
earnest
in
this
matter
will
you
each
give
your
opinion
on
this
one
point
i
suppose
it
is
unquestionable
ruth
said
that
are
in
existence
and
that
they
are
patronized
by
the
lowest
and
vilest
of
human
beings
but
the
sort
of
dance
indulged
in
has
no
more
likeness
to
the
dances
of
cultivated
society
than
than
the
drunkard
lying
in
the
gutter
bears
likeness
to
the
elegant
young
man
of
fashion
who
takes
his
social
sips
from
a
silver
goblet
lined
with
gold
at
his
mother
refreshment
table
marion
said
interrupting
her
and
speaking
with
energy
yet
you
will
admit
that
the
one
may
be
and
awfully
often
is
the
stepping
stone
to
the
other
it
is
true
eurie
said
both
are
true
i
never
thought
of
it
before
but
there
is
no
denying
it
as
for
flossy
she
simply
bowed
her
head
as
one
interested
but
not
excited
then
may
i
bring
in
one
of
my
verses
religion
and
undefiled
before
god
and
the
father
is
this
to
visit
the
fatherless
and
the
widow
in
their
affliction
and
to
keep
himself
from
the
world
does
that
apply
if
the
world
can
carry
this
amusement
to
such
depths
of
degradation
and
if
the
elegant
parlor
dance
is
or
be
in
the
remotest
degree
the
first
step
thereto
we
keeping
ourselves
unspotted
if
we
have
anything
to
do
with
it
countenance
it
in
any
way
do
you
see
that
the
question
after
all
is
the
same
in
many
respects
as
the
one
we
have
been
over
this
ground
before
suppose
we
grant
for
argument
sake
that
not
one
of
you
is
in
danger
of
being
led
away
to
any
sort
of
excess
and
i
should
hardly
dare
to
admit
it
in
my
own
case
because
of
a
verse
in
this
same
old
book
him
that
thinketh
he
standeth
take
heed
lest
he
fall
but
if
it
be
so
let
me
give
you
another
of
my
selections
rather
let
me
read
the
entire
argument
whereupon
she
turned
to
the
tenth
chapter
of
first
corinthians
and
read
paul
argument
about
eating
meat
offered
to
idols
pausing
with
special
emphasis
over
the
words
i
say
not
thine
own
but
of
the
did
i
understand
you
to
say
eurie
that
it
is
a
very
general
belief
among
dancers
that
christians
are
inconsistent
who
indulge
in
this
amusement
it
is
a
provoking
truth
that
there
is
do
you
know
ruth
how
we
used
to
be
merry
over
the
symonds
girls
and
that
young
winters
who
were
well
they
made
rather
greater
pretensions
with
their
religion
than
some
others
did
and
that
made
us
specially
amused
over
them
then
eurie
was
their
influence
unfortunate
on
you
i
am
not
on
your
side
mistress
wilbur
you
should
have
more
conscience
than
to
keep
me
all
the
time
condemning
myself
that
is
answer
enough
marion
said
smiling
i
am
only
asking
for
information
you
know
i
never
danced
but
in
the
light
of
that
confession
hear
this
if
thy
brother
be
grieved
with
thy
meat
now
walkest
thou
not
charitably
destroy
not
him
with
thy
meat
for
whom
christ
died
let
not
your
good
be
evil
spoken
is
that
precisely
what
you
were
doing
of
the
good
in
those
eurie
now
a
sophist
would
possibly
say
that
the
argument
of
paul
had
reference
to
food
offered
to
idols
and
not
to
dancing
but
i
think
here
is
a
chance
for
us
to
exercise
that
judgment
and
common
sense
which
we
are
so
fond
of
talking
about
the
main
point
seems
to
be
not
to
destroy
those
for
whom
christ
died
does
it
make
any
difference
whether
we
do
it
with
our
digestive
organs
or
with
our
feet
but
what
is
the
sophist
going
to
do
with
this
is
good
neither
to
eat
flesh
nor
to
drink
wine
nor
anything
whereby
thy
brother
stumbleth
or
is
offended
or
is
made
weak
you
see
he
may
or
may
not
be
a
fool
for
allowing
himself
to
be
led
astray
paul
says
nothing
about
that
he
simply
directs
as
to
the
christian
duty
in
the
matter
ruth
made
a
movement
of
impatience
you
are
arguing
marion
on
the
supposition
that
a
great
many
people
are
led
astray
by
dancing
whereas
i
do
believe
that
to
be
the
case
do
you
believe
one
soul
ever
was
why
yes
i
suppose
so
we
even
know
one
eurie
said
speaking
low
and
looking
very
grave
do
you
believe
it
is
possible
that
another
soul
may
in
the
next
million
years
of
course
it
is
possible
then
the
question
is
how
much
is
one
soul
worth
i
do
feel
prepared
to
estimate
it
do
you
to
which
question
ruth
made
no
reply
there
is
another
point
marion
said
you
young
ladies
talk
about
being
careful
with
whom
you
dance
do
you
accept
the
attentions
of
strange
young
gentlemen
who
have
been
introduced
to
you
by
your
fashionable
friends
take
townsend
the
young
man
who
came
here
a
stranger
and
was
introduced
in
society
by
the
wagners
because
they
met
him
when
abroad
did
you
dance
with
him
eurie
mitchell
dozens
of
times
said
eurie
promptly
and
flossy
did
you
flossy
nodded
her
golden
head
well
now
you
know
i
suppose
that
he
has
proved
to
be
a
perfect
libertine
honestly
would
you
both
feel
better
if
he
had
never
had
his
arm
around
you
marion
your
way
of
saying
that
thing
is
simply
disgusting
ruth
said
in
great
heat
is
it
my
way
of
saying
it
or
is
it
the
thing
itself
marion
asked
coolly
i
tell
you
girls
it
is
impossible
to
know
whether
the
man
who
dresses
well
and
calls
on
you
at
stated
intervals
looking
and
talking
like
a
gentleman
is
not
a
very
satan
who
will
lead
away
the
pretty
guileless
unsuspecting
young
girl
who
is
worth
his
trouble
and
the
leading
often
and
often
commences
with
a
dance
and
the
young
girl
may
never
have
been
allowed
to
dance
with
him
at
all
had
not
stately
and
entirely
unexceptionable
leaders
of
society
like
our
ruth
here
allowed
it
first
it
is
the
same
question
after
all
and
it
narrows
down
to
a
fine
point
a
thing
that
can
possibly
lead
one
to
eternal
death
a
christian
has
no
business
to
meddle
with
even
if
he
knows
of
but
one
soul
in
a
million
years
who
has
been
so
wrecked
in
all
this
we
have
not
even
glanced
at
the
endless
directions
to
the
time
to
be
in
season
and
out
of
season
to
while
the
day
lasts
watch
and
be
sober
what
do
all
these
verses
mean
are
we
obeying
them
when
we
spend
half
the
night
in
a
whirl
of
wild
pleasure
the
fact
remains
that
a
majority
of
people
are
not
temperate
in
their
dancing
they
do
it
night
after
night
they
long
after
it
and
are
miserable
if
the
weather
or
the
cough
keeps
them
away
i
know
dozens
of
such
young
ladies
i
have
them
as
my
pupils
my
heart
trembles
for
them
they
are
just
intoxicated
with
dancing
and
they
quote
you
ruth
erskine
as
an
example
when
i
try
to
talk
with
them
i
have
heard
them
whether
it
is
wrong
for
other
people
or
not
as
true
as
i
sit
here
i
can
tell
you
this
i
have
two
girls
in
my
class
who
are
killing
themselves
with
this
amusement
carried
to
its
least
damaging
extreme
for
they
still
think
they
are
very
careful
with
whom
they
dance
and
you
are
in
a
measure
at
least
responsible
for
their
folly
you
need
say
they
are
simpletons
i
think
they
are
but
what
of
it
the
brother
perish
for
whom
christ
died
nell
made
a
remark
that
startled
me
a
little
it
was
so
queer
eurie
said
this
after
the
startled
hush
that
fell
over
them
at
the
close
of
marion
eager
sentence
had
in
part
subsided
we
were
speaking
of
a
party
where
we
had
been
one
evening
and
some
of
the
girls
had
danced
every
set
till
they
were
completely
worn
out
some
of
them
had
been
dancing
with
rather
questionable
young
men
too
for
i
shall
have
to
own
that
all
the
gentlemen
who
get
admitted
into
fashionable
parlors
are
not
angels
by
any
means
i
know
there
are
several
who
are
supposed
to
be
of
the
first
society
that
father
has
forbidden
me
ever
to
dance
with
we
were
talking
about
some
of
these
and
about
the
extreme
manner
in
which
the
dancing
was
carried
on
when
nell
said
tell
you
what
eurie
i
hope
my
wife
was
there
me
i
said
did
know
she
was
in
existence
where
do
you
keep
her
he
was
as
sober
as
a
judge
is
on
the
earth
somewhere
of
course
if
i
am
to
have
her
he
said
what
i
say
is
i
hope
she
was
there
if
i
thought
she
was
among
those
dancers
i
would
go
and
knock
the
fellow
down
who
insulted
her
by
swinging
her
around
in
that
fashion
i
want
my
wife
hand
to
be
kept
for
me
to
hold
i
do
thank
anybody
else
for
doing
that
part
for
me
precisely
marion
said
it
is
considered
unladylike
i
believe
for
people
to
talk
about
love
and
marriage
i
never
could
see
why
i
sure
neither
of
them
is
wicked
but
i
suppose
each
of
us
occasionally
thinks
of
the
possibility
of
having
a
friend
as
dear
even
as
a
husband
how
would
you
like
it
girls
to
have
him
spend
his
evenings
dancing
with
first
one
young
lady
and
then
another
offering
them
attentions
that
under
any
other
circumstances
would
stamp
him
as
a
libertine
whichever
way
you
look
at
this
question
it
is
a
disagreeable
one
to
me
i
may
never
be
married
it
is
not
at
all
likely
that
i
ever
shall
i
ought
to
have
been
thinking
about
it
long
ago
if
i
was
ever
going
to
indulge
in
that
sort
of
life
but
if
i
i
heartily
glad
of
one
thing
and
mind
i
mean
it
that
no
man
but
my
husband
shall
ever
put
his
arm
around
me
nor
hold
my
hand
unless
it
is
to
keep
me
from
actual
danger
falling
over
a
precipice
you
know
or
some
such
unusual
matter
as
that
flossy
has
opened
her
lips
this
evening
why
do
you
talk
child
does
marion
overwhelm
you
i
do
wonder
such
a
tornado
as
she
has
poured
out
upon
us
i
never
heard
the
like
in
my
life
it
is
all
in
the
bible
that
is
one
comfort
though
dear
me
i
do
know
but
the
spirit
of
it
is
what
do
you
think
about
it
all
sure
enough
marion
said
turning
to
flossy
as
eurie
paused
little
flossy
where
are
your
verses
you
were
going
to
give
us
whatever
you
found
in
the
bible
you
were
the
best
witness
of
all
because
you
brought
such
an
unprejudiced
determination
to
the
search
what
did
you
find
my
search
did
take
the
form
i
meant
it
should
flossy
said
i
did
look
far
nor
long
and
i
did
not
decide
the
question
for
anybody
else
only
for
myself
i
found
only
two
verses
two
pieces
of
verses
i
mean
i
stopped
at
those
and
thought
about
them
all
the
rest
of
the
week
these
are
the
ones
and
flossy
soft
sweet
voice
repeated
them
without
turning
to
the
bible
ye
do
in
word
or
deed
do
all
in
the
name
of
the
lord
jesus
ye
do
do
it
heartily
as
to
the
lord
and
not
unto
men
those
verses
just
held
me
i
thought
about
dancing
about
all
the
times
in
which
i
had
danced
and
the
people
with
whom
i
had
danced
and
the
words
we
had
said
to
each
other
and
i
could
not
see
that
in
any
possible
way
it
could
be
done
in
the
name
of
the
lord
jesus
or
that
it
could
be
done
heartily
as
unto
the
lord
i
settled
my
own
heart
with
those
words
that
for
me
to
dance
after
i
knew
that
whatever
in
word
or
deed
i
did
i
was
pledged
to
do
for
the
would
be
an
impossibility
an
absolute
hush
fell
upon
them
all
marion
looked
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
flushed
and
eager
faces
and
then
at
the
sweet
drooping
face
of
their
little
flossy
we
have
spent
our
strength
vainly
she
said
at
last
it
is
our
privilege
to
get
up
higher
to
look
at
all
these
things
from
the
mount
whereon
god
will
let
us
stand
if
we
want
to
climb
i
think
little
flossy
has
got
there
after
all
eurie
said
that
verse
would
cut
off
a
great
many
things
that
are
considered
harmless
what
does
that
prove
my
beloved
eureka
marion
said
quickly
thy
right
hand
offend
thee
cut
it
off
and
cast
it
from
thee
is
another
bible
verse
these
verses
of
flossy
mean
something
surely
what
they
mean
is
the
question
left
for
us
to
decide
after
all
ruth
i
agree
with
you
it
is
a
question
that
must
be
left
to
our
judgment
and
common
sense
only
we
are
bound
to
strengthen
our
common
sense
and
confirm
our
judgments
in
the
light
of
the
lamp
that
is
promised
as
a
guide
to
our
feet
almost
nothing
was
said
among
them
after
that
except
the
commonplaces
of
the
next
afternoon
as
marion
was
working
out
a
refractory
example
in
algebra
for
gracie
dennis
she
bent
lower
over
her
slate
and
said
miss
wilbur
did
you
know
that
your
friends
miss
erskine
miss
shipley
and
miss
mitchell
had
all
declined
garland
invitation
and
sent
her
an
informal
little
note
signed
by
them
all
to
the
effect
that
they
had
decided
not
to
dance
any
more
no
said
marion
the
rich
blood
mounting
to
her
temples
and
her
face
breaking
into
a
smile
how
did
you
hear
garland
told
my
father
she
said
she
honored
them
for
their
consistency
and
thought
more
highly
of
their
new
departure
than
she
ever
had
before
it
rather
remarkable
so
early
in
their
christian
life
do
you
think
rather
marion
said
with
a
smile
and
she
followed
it
by
a
soft
little
sigh
had
not
been
invited
to
garland
there
was
no
opportunity
for
her
to
show
whether
she
was
consistent
or
not
illustration
illustration
chapter
xix
keeping
the
promise
it
was
curious
how
our
four
girls
set
about
enlarging
the
that
idea
had
taken
hold
of
them
as
the
next
thing
to
be
done
the
wonder
was
eurie
said
that
christian
people
had
not
worked
at
it
before
i
am
sure
she
added
that
if
anyone
had
invited
me
to
attend
i
should
have
gone
long
ago
just
to
please
if
it
was
one
that
i
cared
to
please
and
marion
answered
with
a
smile
i
am
sure
you
would
too
with
your
present
feelings
still
none
of
them
doubted
but
that
they
would
have
success
they
saw
little
of
each
other
during
the
days
that
intervened
and
their
plan
necessarily
involved
the
going
alone
or
with
what
company
they
could
gather
instead
of
meeting
and
keeping
each
other
company
as
they
had
done
in
the
first
days
of
their
life
marion
came
first
and
alone
she
went
forward
to
their
usual
seat
with
a
very
forlorn
and
desolate
air
she
had
entered
upon
the
work
with
enthusiasm
and
with
eager
desire
and
expectation
of
success
to
be
sure
she
was
a
long
time
deciding
whom
to
ask
and
several
times
changed
her
plans
at
last
her
heart
settled
on
miss
banks
the
friend
with
whom
she
had
almost
been
intimate
before
these
new
intimacies
gathered
around
her
latterly
they
had
said
little
to
each
other
miss
banks
had
seemed
to
avoid
marion
since
that
rainy
monday
when
they
came
in
contact
so
sharply
she
was
not
exactly
rude
nor
in
the
least
unkind
she
simply
seemed
to
feel
that
the
points
of
congeniality
between
them
were
broken
and
so
avoided
her
she
did
this
so
successfully
that
even
after
marion
thought
to
invite
her
to
the
meeting
had
taken
decided
shape
it
was
difficult
to
find
the
opportunity
having
gotten
the
idea
however
she
was
persistent
in
it
and
at
last
during
recess
on
the
very
day
of
the
meeting
she
came
across
her
in
the
library
looking
aimlessly
over
the
rows
of
books
in
search
of
wisdom
or
recreation
marion
asked
stopping
beside
her
and
speaking
with
the
familiarity
of
former
days
in
search
of
some
tiresome
references
for
my
class
in
philosophy
some
of
the
scholars
are
provokingly
in
earnest
in
the
study
and
will
not
be
satisfied
with
the
platitudes
of
the
that
is
a
refreshing
departure
from
the
ordinary
state
of
things
it
marion
asked
laughing
at
the
way
in
which
the
progress
of
her
pupils
was
put
then
without
waiting
for
an
answer
and
already
feeling
her
resolution
beginning
to
cool
she
plunged
into
the
subject
that
interested
her
i
have
been
in
search
of
you
all
the
morning
that
surprising
miss
banks
said
coolly
could
i
be
found
i
have
been
no
further
away
than
my
well
i
mean
looking
for
you
at
a
time
when
you
were
not
engaged
or
perhaps
looking
forward
to
seeing
you
at
such
a
time
would
be
a
more
proper
way
of
putting
it
said
marion
trying
to
smile
and
yet
feeling
a
trifle
annoyed
one
is
apt
to
be
somewhat
engaged
in
a
during
especially
if
one
is
a
teacher
they
were
not
getting
on
at
all
marion
decided
to
speak
without
trying
to
bring
herself
gracefully
to
the
point
i
want
to
ask
a
favor
of
you
will
you
go
to
meeting
with
me
to
meeting
miss
banks
repeated
without
turning
from
the
what
meeting
is
there
why
the
at
the
first
church
there
is
always
a
meeting
there
on
wednesday
nights
miss
banks
turned
herself
slowly
away
from
the
book
she
was
examining
and
fixed
her
clear
cold
gray
eyes
on
marion
and
so
there
has
been
every
wednesday
evening
during
the
five
years
that
we
have
been
in
school
together
i
presume
to
what
can
i
be
indebted
for
such
an
invitation
at
this
late
day
it
was
very
hard
for
marion
not
to
get
angry
she
knew
this
cold
composure
was
intended
as
a
rebuke
to
herself
for
presuming
to
have
withdrawn
from
the
clique
that
had
hitherto
spent
much
time
together
what
is
the
use
of
this
she
asked
a
shade
of
impatience
in
her
voice
though
she
tried
to
control
it
you
know
miss
banks
that
i
profess
to
have
made
a
discovery
during
the
last
few
weeks
that
i
try
to
arrange
all
my
actions
with
a
view
to
the
new
revelations
of
life
and
duty
which
i
have
certainly
had
in
simple
language
you
know
that
whereas
i
not
long
ago
presumed
to
scoff
at
conversion
and
at
the
idea
of
a
life
abiding
in
christ
i
believe
now
that
i
have
been
converted
and
that
the
lord
jesus
is
my
friend
and
brother
i
want
to
tell
you
that
i
have
found
rest
and
peace
in
him
is
it
any
wonder
that
i
should
desire
it
for
my
friends
i
do
honestly
crave
for
you
the
same
experience
that
i
have
enjoyed
and
to
that
end
i
have
asked
you
to
attend
the
meeting
with
me
it
is
impossible
to
describe
the
changes
on
miss
banks
face
during
this
sentence
there
was
a
touch
of
embarrassment
and
more
than
a
touch
of
incredulity
and
over
all
a
look
of
great
amazement
she
continued
to
survey
marion
from
head
to
foot
with
those
cold
gray
eyes
for
as
much
as
a
minute
after
she
had
ceased
speaking
then
she
said
speaking
slowly
as
if
she
were
measuring
every
word
i
am
sure
i
ought
to
be
grateful
for
the
trouble
you
have
taken
the
more
so
as
i
had
not
presumed
to
think
that
you
had
any
interest
in
either
my
body
or
my
soul
but
as
i
have
had
no
new
and
surprising
revelations
and
know
nothing
about
the
friend
and
brother
of
whom
you
speak
i
may
be
excused
from
coveting
the
like
experience
with
yourself
however
delightful
you
may
have
found
it
as
to
the
meeting
i
went
once
to
that
church
to
attend
a
too
and
if
there
can
be
a
more
refined
and
long
exhibition
of
dullness
than
was
presented
to
us
there
i
do
know
where
to
look
for
it
i
wonder
why
the
does
ring
it
is
three
minutes
past
the
time
by
my
watch
marion
without
an
attempt
at
a
reply
turned
and
went
swiftly
down
the
hall
she
was
glad
that
just
then
the
tardy
bell
pealed
forth
and
that
she
was
obliged
to
go
at
once
to
the
and
involve
herself
in
the
intricacies
of
algebra
without
this
incentive
to
she
felt
that
she
would
have
given
way
to
the
hot
disappointed
tears
that
were
choking
in
her
throat
how
sad
her
heart
was
as
she
sat
there
alone
in
the
it
was
early
and
but
few
were
present
she
had
never
felt
so
much
alone
the
companionship
which
had
been
so
close
and
so
constant
during
the
few
weeks
past
seemed
suddenly
to
have
been
removed
from
her
and
when
she
essayed
to
go
back
to
the
old
friend
she
had
stood
coldly
and
heartlessly
aye
worse
than
that
mockingly
aloof
she
had
overheard
her
that
very
afternoon
detailing
to
one
of
the
under
teachers
fragments
of
the
conversation
in
the
library
heart
was
wounded
to
its
very
depths
perhaps
it
is
little
wonder
that
she
had
made
no
other
attempt
to
secure
company
for
the
evening
there
were
by
the
score
that
she
might
have
asked
doubtless
some
one
of
the
number
would
accept
her
invitation
but
she
had
not
thought
so
she
had
shrunken
from
any
other
effort
in
mortal
terror
i
am
not
fitted
for
such
work
she
said
in
bitterness
of
soul
not
even
for
work
what
i
do
and
then
despite
the
class
she
had
brushed
away
a
tear
so
there
she
sat
alone
till
suddenly
the
door
opened
with
more
force
than
usual
and
closed
with
a
little
bang
and
eurie
mitchell
with
a
face
on
which
there
glowed
traces
of
excitement
came
like
a
whiff
of
wind
and
rustled
into
a
seat
beside
her
alone
like
herself
you
here
she
said
and
there
was
surprise
in
her
whisper
thought
you
would
be
late
and
not
be
alone
i
am
glad
of
it
i
mean
i
am
almost
glad
do
you
think
nell
would
come
with
me
i
counted
on
him
as
a
matter
of
course
he
is
so
obliging
always
willing
to
take
me
wherever
i
want
to
go
and
often
disarranging
his
own
engagements
so
that
i
need
not
be
disappointed
i
was
just
as
sure
of
him
i
thought
as
i
was
of
myself
and
then
i
coaxed
him
harder
than
i
ever
did
before
in
my
life
and
he
would
come
in
he
came
to
the
door
with
me
and
said
i
need
be
afraid
but
that
he
would
be
on
hand
to
see
me
home
and
he
would
see
safely
home
any
number
of
girls
that
i
chose
to
drum
up
but
as
for
sitting
in
here
a
whole
hour
waiting
for
it
to
be
time
to
go
home
that
was
beyond
him
too
much
for
mortal
patience
was
it
just
too
bad
i
was
so
sure
of
it
too
i
told
him
about
our
plans
about
our
promise
indeed
and
how
i
had
counted
on
him
and
all
he
said
was
you
know
the
old
proverb
sis
never
count
your
chickens
before
they
are
hatched
or
a
more
elegant
phrasing
of
it
never
eat
your
fish
till
you
catch
him
now
i
not
caught
yet
someway
the
right
sort
of
bait
has
reached
me
yet
i
was
never
so
disappointed
in
my
life
did
you
try
to
get
some
one
to
come
yes
said
marion
and
failed
she
forced
herself
to
say
that
much
how
eurie
go
through
with
all
these
details
if
her
heart
had
ached
as
mine
does
she
could
marion
told
herself
she
might
have
known
if
she
had
used
her
judgment
that
eurie
heart
was
not
of
the
sort
that
would
ever
ache
over
anything
as
hers
could
and
yet
eurie
was
bitterly
disappointed
she
had
counted
on
nell
and
expected
him
had
high
hopes
for
him
and
here
they
were
dashed
into
nothingness
who
knew
that
he
could
be
so
obstinate
over
a
trifle
surely
it
was
a
trifle
just
to
come
to
once
she
knew
she
would
have
done
it
for
him
even
in
the
days
when
it
would
have
been
a
bore
she
did
not
understand
it
at
all
meantime
ruth
had
been
having
her
experiences
this
promise
of
hers
troubled
her
perhaps
you
can
not
imagine
what
an
exceedingly
disagreeable
thing
it
seemed
to
her
to
go
hunting
up
somebody
to
go
to
with
her
where
could
she
turn
there
were
so
few
people
with
whom
she
came
in
contact
that
it
would
not
be
absurd
to
ask
her
father
she
put
aside
at
once
as
entirely
out
of
the
question
it
was
simply
an
absurdity
to
think
of
asking
him
to
go
to
he
rarely
went
to
church
even
on
the
sabbath
less
often
now
than
he
used
to
do
it
would
simply
be
annoying
him
and
exposing
religion
to
his
contempt
so
his
daughter
reasoned
she
sighed
over
it
while
she
reasoned
she
wished
most
earnestly
that
it
were
not
so
she
prayed
and
she
thought
it
was
with
all
her
heart
that
god
would
speak
to
her
father
in
some
way
by
some
voice
that
he
would
heed
and
yet
she
allowed
herself
to
be
sure
that
his
only
and
cherished
daughter
had
the
one
voice
that
could
not
hope
to
influence
him
in
the
least
well
there
was
her
friend
wayne
i
wonder
if
i
can
describe
to
you
how
impossible
it
seemed
to
her
to
ask
him
to
go
not
that
he
would
not
have
accompanied
her
he
would
in
a
minute
he
would
do
almost
anything
she
asked
she
felt
as
sure
that
she
could
get
him
to
occupy
a
seat
in
the
first
church
that
evening
as
she
felt
sure
of
going
there
herself
but
she
asked
herself
of
what
earthly
use
would
it
be
he
would
go
simply
to
please
what
he
would
suppose
was
a
whim
of
hers
he
would
listen
with
an
amused
smile
slightly
tinged
with
sarcasm
to
all
the
words
that
would
be
spoken
that
evening
and
he
would
have
ready
a
hundred
mildly
funny
things
to
say
about
them
when
the
meeting
closed
for
weeks
afterward
he
would
be
apt
to
bring
in
nicely
fitting
quotations
gleaned
from
that
evening
of
watchfulness
fitting
them
into
absurd
places
and
making
them
seem
the
veriest
folly
that
would
be
the
fruit
ruth
shrank
with
all
her
soul
from
such
a
result
these
things
were
sacred
to
her
she
did
not
see
how
it
would
be
possible
to
endure
the
quizzical
turn
that
would
be
given
to
them
i
want
you
to
notice
that
in
all
this
reasoning
she
did
not
see
that
she
had
undertaken
not
only
her
own
work
but
the
lord
when
one
attempts
not
only
to
drop
the
seed
but
to
the
fruit
that
shall
spring
up
no
wonder
one
stands
back
appalled
yet
was
she
not
busying
her
heart
with
the
results
the
end
of
it
was
that
she
decided
whatever
else
she
did
to
say
nothing
to
wayne
about
the
meeting
no
i
am
mistaken
that
was
not
the
end
there
suddenly
came
in
with
these
musings
a
startling
thought
if
i
can
not
endure
the
foolishness
that
will
result
from
one
evening
how
am
i
to
endure
companionship
for
a
lifetime
that
was
a
thought
that
would
not
slumber
again
but
she
must
find
some
one
whom
she
was
willing
to
ask
to
go
to
there
was
her
miserable
promise
hedging
her
in
who
was
she
willing
to
ask
she
ran
over
her
list
of
acquaintances
there
was
one
how
strange
it
was
she
could
think
of
those
whom
flossy
might
ask
and
there
was
eurie
surrounded
by
a
large
family
and
as
for
marion
her
opportunities
were
unlimited
but
for
her
forlorn
self
in
all
the
large
circle
of
her
acquaintance
there
seemed
no
one
to
ask
the
truth
was
ruth
was
shiveringly
afraid
of
casting
pearls
before
swine
not
that
she
put
it
in
that
way
but
she
would
rather
have
been
struck
than
to
have
been
made
an
object
of
ridicule
and
yet
there
were
times
when
she
wished
she
had
lived
in
the
days
of
martyrdom
the
church
of
is
full
of
just
such
martyr
spirits
the
result
was
precisely
what
might
have
been
expected
she
dallied
with
her
miserable
cowardice
which
she
did
not
call
by
that
name
at
all
until
there
really
was
no
person
within
reach
to
invite
to
the
meeting
who
would
have
supposed
all
this
of
ruth
erskine
no
one
would
have
been
less
likely
to
have
done
so
than
herself
she
went
alone
to
the
meeting
at
a
late
hour
and
with
a
very
miserable
sore
sad
heart
to
which
marion
was
nothing
in
comparison
yet
there
was
something
accomplished
if
she
had
but
known
it
she
was
beginning
to
understand
herself
she
had
a
much
lower
opinion
of
ruth
erskine
as
she
sat
there
meeting
the
wondering
gaze
of
eurie
and
the
quick
inquiring
glance
of
marion
than
she
ever
had
felt
in
her
life
i
said
she
was
late
but
flossy
was
later
somebody
else
must
have
been
at
work
about
that
meeting
and
have
been
more
successful
than
our
girls
for
the
room
was
fuller
than
usual
marion
had
begun
to
grow
anxious
for
the
little
flossy
that
had
crept
so
near
to
their
hearts
and
to
make
frequent
turnings
of
the
head
to
see
if
she
were
not
coming
when
at
last
she
shimmered
down
the
aisle
a
soft
bright
rainbow
for
she
had
given
over
wearing
her
favorite
colors
and
she
could
no
more
help
getting
them
on
becomingly
than
a
bird
can
help
looking
graceful
in
its
plumage
why
should
either
of
them
try
to
help
it
but
flossy
was
not
alone
there
was
a
tall
portly
form
and
a
splendidly
balanced
head
resting
on
firm
shoulders
that
followed
her
down
to
the
seat
where
the
girls
were
waiting
for
her

how
it
was
done
flossy
came
quite
down
the
broad
aisle
to
the
seat
which
the
girls
had
by
tacit
understanding
chosen
for
their
own
her
face
just
radiant
with
a
sort
of
surprised
satisfaction
and
the
gentleman
who
followed
her
with
an
assured
and
measured
step
was
none
other
than
judge
erskine
himself
he
may
have
been
surprised
at
his
own
appearance
in
that
place
for
prayer
but
no
surprise
of
his
could
compare
with
the
amazement
of
his
daughter
ruth
for
once
in
her
life
her
composure
forsook
her
and
her
look
could
be
called
nothing
less
than
an
absolute
stare
of
the
four
flossy
only
had
succeeded
the
way
of
it
was
this
having
become
a
realist
in
the
most
emphatic
sense
of
that
word
to
have
promised
to
bring
some
one
with
her
to
meeting
if
she
possibly
could
meant
to
her
just
that
and
nothing
less
than
that
of
course
such
an
understanding
of
a
promise
made
it
impossible
to
stop
with
the
asking
of
one
person
or
two
or
three
provided
her
invitations
met
with
only
refusals
she
had
started
out
as
confident
of
success
as
eurie
she
felt
nearly
certain
of
baker
not
because
he
was
any
more
likely
of
his
own
will
to
choose
the
than
he
had
been
all
his
life
thus
far
but
because
he
was
growing
every
day
more
anxious
to
give
pleasure
to
flossy
having
some
dim
sense
of
this
in
her
heart
flossy
reasoned
that
it
would
be
right
to
put
this
power
of
hers
to
the
good
use
of
winning
him
to
the
meeting
for
who
could
tell
what
words
from
god
spirit
might
reach
him
while
there
so
she
asked
him
to
go
to
her
surprise
and
to
baker
real
annoyance
he
was
obliged
to
refuse
her
he
was
more
than
willing
to
go
even
to
a
if
thereby
he
could
take
one
step
forward
toward
the
place
in
her
life
that
he
desired
to
fill
therefore
his
regrets
were
profuse
and
sincere
it
was
club
night
and
most
unluckily
they
were
to
meet
with
him
and
he
was
to
provide
the
entertainment
under
almost
any
other
circumstances
he
could
have
been
excused
had
he
even
had
the
remotest
idea
that
flossy
would
have
liked
his
company
that
evening
he
could
have
made
arrangements
for
a
change
of
evening
for
the
club
that
is
had
he
known
of
it
earlier
but
as
it
was
she
would
see
how
impossible
it
would
be
for
him
to
get
away
flossy
took
him
at
his
word
would
he
remember
then
she
asked
with
her
most
winning
smile
that
of
all
places
where
she
could
possibly
like
to
see
him
regularly
the
wednesday
evening
at
the
first
church
was
the
place
what
a
bitter
pill
an
evening
would
be
to
baker
but
he
did
not
tell
her
so
he
was
even
growing
to
think
that
he
could
do
that
for
a
while
at
least
from
him
flossy
turned
to
her
brother
but
it
was
club
night
to
him
too
and
while
he
had
not
the
excuse
that
the
entertainer
of
the
club
certainly
had
it
served
very
well
as
an
excuse
though
he
was
frank
enough
to
add
as
for
that
i
do
believe
i
should
go
if
i
had
an
engagement
i
wo
be
hypocrite
enough
to
go
to
the
such
strange
ideas
have
some
otherwise
sensible
people
on
this
subject
of
hypocrisy
it
required
a
good
deal
of
courage
for
flossy
to
ask
her
mother
but
she
accomplished
it
and
received
in
reply
an
astonished
stare
a
laugh
and
the
expression
what
an
absurd
little
fanatic
you
are
getting
to
be
flossy
i
am
sure
one
would
have
looked
for
it
in
a
child
like
you
me
oh
dear
no
i
ca
go
i
never
walk
so
far
you
know
at
least
very
rarely
and
kitty
will
have
the
carriage
in
use
for
waterman
reception
why
you
go
there
child
it
really
is
treating
waterman
well
she
is
such
an
old
friend
these
were
a
few
of
the
many
efforts
which
flossy
made
they
met
with
like
results
until
at
last
the
evening
in
question
found
her
somewhat
belated
and
alone
ringing
at
judge
erskine
mansion
that
important
personage
being
in
the
hall
in
the
act
of
going
out
to
the
he
opened
the
door
and
met
her
hurried
almost
breathless
question
judge
erskine
is
ruth
gone
oh
excuse
me
i
am
in
such
haste
that
i
forgot
courtesy
do
you
think
ruth
is
gone
yes
judge
erskine
knew
that
his
daughter
was
out
for
she
stepped
into
the
library
to
leave
a
message
a
few
moments
ago
and
she
was
then
dressed
for
the
street
and
had
passed
out
a
moment
afterward
then
did
he
know
whether
katie
flinn
the
was
in
of
course
you
wo
know
she
added
blushing
and
smiling
at
the
absurdity
of
her
question
i
mean
could
you
find
out
for
me
whether
she
is
in
and
can
i
speak
to
her
just
a
minute
he
was
fortunately
wiser
than
she
gave
him
credit
for
being
judge
erskine
said
with
a
courtly
bow
and
smile
it
so
happened
that
just
after
his
daughter
departed
katie
had
sought
him
asking
permission
to
be
out
that
evening
until
nine
a
permission
that
she
had
forgotten
to
secure
of
his
daughter
therefore
as
a
most
unusual
circumstance
which
must
have
occurred
for
special
benefit
he
was
posted
even
as
to
katie
whereabouts
he
was
unprepared
for
the
sudden
flushing
of
flossy
cheeks
and
quiver
of
her
almost
baby
chin
oh
i
am
sorry
she
said
and
there
were
actual
tears
in
her
blue
eyes
judge
erskine
saw
them
and
felt
as
if
he
were
in
some
way
a
monster
he
hastened
to
be
sympathetic
if
she
was
alone
and
timid
it
would
afford
him
nothing
but
pleasure
to
see
her
safely
to
any
part
of
the
city
she
chose
to
mention
he
was
going
out
simply
for
a
stroll
with
no
business
whatever
oh
it
is
that
flossy
said
hastily
i
am
such
a
little
way
from
the
chapel
and
it
is
so
early
i
shall
not
be
afraid
but
i
am
so
disappointed
you
see
judge
erskine
we
girls
were
each
to
bring
one
with
us
to
the
meeting
and
i
have
tried
so
hard
i
have
asked
almost
a
dozen
people
and
none
of
them
could
go
at
last
i
happened
to
think
of
your
katie
flinn
i
knew
she
was
in
our
and
i
thought
perhaps
if
i
asked
her
she
would
go
with
me
if
ruth
had
not
done
it
before
me
she
was
my
last
chance
and
i
am
more
disappointed
than
i
can
tell
you
shall
i
try
to
describe
to
you
what
a
strange
sensation
judge
erskine
felt
in
the
region
of
his
heart
as
he
stood
there
in
the
hall
with
that
pretty
blushing
girl
who
seemed
to
him
only
a
child
and
found
that
her
quivering
chin
and
swimming
eyes
meant
simply
that
she
had
failed
in
securing
even
his
chambermaid
to
attend
the
he
never
remembered
to
have
had
such
an
astonishing
feeling
nor
such
a
queer
choking
sensation
in
his
throat
his
own
daughter
was
dignified
and
stately
the
very
picture
of
her
father
every
one
said
he
had
no
idea
that
she
could
shed
a
tear
any
more
than
he
could
himself
but
this
timid
flushing
trembling
little
girl
seemed
made
of
some
other
material
than
just
the
clay
that
he
supposed
himself
to
be
composed
of
he
stood
regarding
her
with
a
sort
of
pleased
wonder
in
common
with
many
other
stately
gentlemen
he
very
much
admired
real
unaffected
artless
childhood
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
grieved
child
stood
before
him
how
could
he
comfort
her
if
a
doll
now
with
curling
hair
and
blue
eyes
could
do
it
how
promptly
should
it
be
bought
and
given
to
this
doll
before
him
but
no
nothing
short
of
some
one
to
accompany
her
to
would
appease
this
little
troubled
bit
of
humanity
in
the
magnanimity
of
his
haughty
heart
the
learned
judge
took
a
sudden
and
almost
overpowering
resolution
could
go
he
asked
her
to
be
sure
he
was
not
katie
flinn
but
he
would
do
his
best
to
take
the
place
of
that
personage
if
she
would
kindly
let
him
go
to
the
said
meeting
with
her
it
was
worth
a
dozen
sittings
even
in
judge
erskine
thought
to
see
the
sudden
clearing
of
that
tearful
face
the
sudden
radiant
outlook
from
those
wet
eyes
he
go
would
he
go
could
anything
be
more
and
verily
judge
erskine
thought
as
he
beheld
her
shining
face
that
there
hardly
could
he
felt
precisely
as
you
do
when
you
have
been
unselfish
toward
a
pretty
child
who
someway
has
won
a
warm
spot
in
your
heart
he
went
to
the
first
church
for
the
first
time
with
no
higher
motive
than
that
never
mind
he
went
flossy
shipley
certainly
was
not
responsible
for
the
motive
of
his
going
neither
did
it
in
any
degree
affect
the
honest
earnest
persistent
effort
she
had
made
that
day
her
account
of
it
was
simple
enough
when
the
girls
met
afterward
to
talk
over
their
efforts
why
you
know
she
said
i
actually
to
bring
some
one
with
me
if
i
possibly
could
so
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
try
in
every
possible
way
up
to
the
very
last
minute
of
the
time
i
had
but
after
all
i
brought
the
one
whom
i
had
not
the
least
idea
of
asking
he
asked
himself
well
marion
said
after
a
period
of
amazed
silence
i
have
made
two
discoveries
one
is
that
people
may
possibly
have
tried
before
this
to
enlarge
the
possibly
we
may
not
after
all
be
the
originators
of
that
brilliant
idea
they
may
have
tried
and
failed
even
as
we
did
for
i
have
learned
that
it
is
not
so
easy
a
matter
as
it
at
first
appears
it
needs
a
power
behind
the
wills
of
people
to
get
them
to
do
even
so
simple
a
thing
as
that
the
other
important
thought
is
there
are
two
ways
of
keeping
a
promise
one
is
to
make
an
attempt
and
fail
saying
to
our
contented
consciences
i
done
my
duty
and
it
is
no
use
you
see
and
the
other
is
to
persist
in
attempt
after
attempt
until
the
very
pertinacity
of
our
faith
accomplishes
the
work
for
us
what
if
we
follow
the
example
of
our
little
flossy
after
this
and
let
a
promise
mean
something
my
example
flossy
said
with
wide
open
eyes
why
i
only
people
just
as
i
said
i
would
but
they
would
come
there
was
one
young
lady
who
walked
home
from
that
eventful
with
a
very
unsatisfied
conscience
ruth
erskine
could
not
get
away
from
the
feeling
that
she
was
a
shirker
all
the
more
so
because
the
person
who
had
sat
very
near
her
was
her
father
not
brought
there
by
any
invitation
from
her
it
was
not
that
she
had
tried
and
failed
that
form
of
it
would
have
been
an
infinite
relief
she
simply
had
not
tried
and
she
made
herself
honestly
confess
to
herself
that
the
trouble
was
she
could
not
be
satisfied
with
one
who
was
within
the
reach
of
her
asking
yet
conscience
working
all
alone
is
a
very
uncomfortable
and
disagreeable
companion
and
often
accomplishes
for
the
time
being
nothing
beyond
making
his
victim
disagreeable
this
was
ruth
to
the
fullest
extent
of
her
power
she
realized
it
and
in
a
measure
felt
ashamed
of
herself
and
struggled
a
little
for
a
better
state
of
mind
it
seemed
ill
payment
for
the
courtesy
which
had
made
harold
wayne
forsake
the
club
before
supper
for
the
purpose
of
walking
home
with
her
from
church
he
was
unusually
kind
too
and
patient
part
of
her
trouble
be
it
known
was
her
determination
in
her
heart
not
to
be
driven
by
that
dreadful
conscience
into
saying
a
single
personal
word
to
harold
wayne
not
that
she
put
it
in
that
way
bless
you
no
satan
rarely
blunders
enough
to
speak
out
plainly
he
has
a
dozen
phrases
that
mean
the
same
thing
people
need
to
be
approached
very
carefully
on
very
special
occasions
which
are
not
apt
to
occur
they
need
to
be
approached
by
just
such
persons
and
in
just
such
words
etc
etc
though
why
it
should
require
such
infinite
tact
and
care
and
skill
to
say
to
a
friend
i
wish
you
were
going
to
heaven
with
me
when
the
person
would
say
without
the
slightest
hesitation
i
wish
you
were
going
to
europe
with
me
and
be
accounted
an
idiot
if
he
made
talk
about
tact
and
skill
and
caution
i
am
sure
i
do
know
yet
all
these
things
ruth
said
to
herself
the
reason
the
thought
ruffled
her
was
because
her
honest
conscience
knew
they
were
false
and
that
she
had
a
right
to
say
harold
i
you
were
a
christian
and
had
no
right
at
all
with
the
results
she
simply
could
not
bring
herself
to
say
it
she
did
not
really
know
why
herself
probably
satan
did
wayne
was
unusually
quiet
and
grave
he
seemed
to
be
doing
what
he
could
to
lead
ruth
into
serious
talk
he
asked
about
the
meeting
whether
there
were
many
out
and
whether
she
enjoyed
it
i
sort
of
like
dennis
he
said
he
is
tremendously
in
earnest
but
why
should
a
man
be
in
earnest
if
he
believes
what
he
is
talking
about
do
you
suppose
he
does
ruth
of
course
ruth
said
shortly
almost
crossly
you
know
he
does
why
do
you
ask
such
a
foolish
question
oh
i
do
know
half
the
time
it
seems
to
me
as
if
the
religious
people
were
trying
to
humbug
the
world
because
you
see
they
do
act
as
if
they
were
in
dead
earnest
very
few
of
them
do
at
least
that
is
a
very
easy
thing
to
say
and
people
seem
to
be
fond
of
saying
it
ruth
said
and
then
she
simply
would
not
talk
on
that
subject
or
any
other
she
was
miserably
unhappy
an
awakened
conscience
toyed
with
is
a
very
fruitful
source
of
misery
she
was
glad
when
the
walk
was
concluded
shall
i
come
in
wayne
asked
lingering
on
the
step
half
smiling
half
wistful
what
do
you
advise
shall
i
go
back
to
the
club
or
call
on
you
now
ruth
hated
that
club
she
was
much
afraid
of
its
influence
over
her
friend
she
had
determined
as
soon
as
she
could
plan
a
line
of
operation
to
set
systematically
at
work
to
withdraw
him
from
its
influence
but
she
was
not
ready
for
it
yet
and
among
other
things
that
she
was
not
ready
for
was
a
call
from
wayne
it
seemed
to
her
that
in
her
present
miserable
unsettled
state
it
would
be
simply
impossible
to
carry
on
a
conversation
with
him
true
to
her
usually
frank
nature
she
answered
promptly
i
have
certainly
no
desire
for
you
to
go
to
the
club
either
on
this
evening
or
any
other
but
to
be
frank
i
would
rather
be
alone
this
evening
i
want
to
think
over
some
matters
of
importance
and
to
decide
them
you
will
not
think
strangely
of
me
for
saying
that
will
you
oh
no
he
said
and
he
smiled
kindly
on
her
yet
he
was
very
much
disappointed
he
showed
it
in
his
face
many
a
time
afterward
as
ruth
sat
thinking
over
this
conversation
recalling
every
little
detail
of
it
recalling
the
look
on
his
face
and
the
peculiar
sadness
in
his
eyes
she
thought
within
herself
if
i
had
said
i
want
you
to
come
in
i
want
to
talk
with
you
i
want
you
to
decide
now
to
live
for
christ
i
wonder
what
he
have
answered
but
she
did
not
say
it
instead
she
turned
from
him
and
went
into
the
house
and
he
went
directly
to
his
club
an
unaccountable
gloom
hung
over
him
he
must
have
companionship
if
not
with
his
chosen
and
promised
wife
then
with
the
club
that
was
just
what
ruth
was
to
him
and
it
was
one
of
the
questions
that
tormented
her
there
were
reasons
why
thought
about
it
had
forced
itself
upon
her
during
the
last
few
days
she
was
pledged
to
him
long
before
she
found
this
new
experience
the
question
was
could
she
fulfil
those
pledges
had
they
a
thought
in
common
now
could
she
live
with
him
the
sort
of
life
that
she
had
promised
to
live
and
that
she
solemnly
meant
to
live
if
she
was
it
right
to
do
so
you
see
she
had
enough
to
torment
her
only
she
set
about
thinking
of
it
in
so
strange
a
manner
not
at
all
as
she
would
have
thought
about
it
if
the
pledges
she
had
given
him
had
meant
to
her
all
that
they
mean
to
some
all
that
they
ought
to
mean
to
any
one
who
makes
them
this
phase
of
it
also
troubled
her
illustration

chapter
xxi
ruth
and
harold
there
had
been
in
judge
erskine
mind
a
slight
sense
of
wonderment
as
to
how
he
should
meet
his
daughter
the
morning
after
his
astounding
appearance
at
such
a
new
and
singular
departure
was
it
that
he
even
felt
a
slight
shade
of
embarrassment
but
before
the
hour
of
meeting
her
arrived
his
thoughts
were
turned
into
an
entirely
new
channel
he
met
her
looking
very
grave
and
with
a
touch
of
tenderness
about
his
manner
that
was
new
to
her
she
on
her
part
was
not
much
more
at
rest
than
she
had
been
the
evening
before
she
realized
that
her
heart
was
in
an
actual
state
of
rebellion
against
any
form
of
decided
christian
work
that
she
could
plan
clearly
something
was
wrong
with
her
if
she
had
been
familiar
with
a
certain
old
christian
she
might
have
borrowed
his
language
to
express
in
part
her
feeling
to
will
is
present
with
me
but
how
to
perform
that
which
is
good
i
know
not
not
quite
that
either
for
while
she
said
i
do
this
thing
or
that
thing
she
was
enough
to
see
that
it
simply
meant
after
all
i
will
not
the
will
was
at
fault
and
she
knew
it
she
did
not
fully
comprehend
yet
that
she
had
set
out
to
be
a
christian
and
at
the
same
time
to
have
her
own
way
in
the
least
little
thing
but
she
had
a
glimmering
sense
that
such
was
the
trouble
her
father
after
taking
surreptitious
glances
at
her
pale
face
and
troubled
eyes
decided
finally
that
what
was
to
be
said
must
be
said
and
asked
abruptly
when
did
you
see
harold
my
daughter
ruth
started
and
the
question
made
the
blood
rush
to
her
face
she
did
not
know
why
i
saw
him
last
evening
after
i
believe
she
answered
speaking
in
her
usual
quiet
tone
but
fixing
an
inquiring
look
on
her
father
did
he
speak
of
not
feeling
well
no
sir
not
at
all
why
i
hear
that
he
is
quite
sick
this
morning
was
taken
in
the
night
something
like
a
fit
i
should
judge
may
be
nothing
but
a
slight
attack
brought
on
by
late
suppers
he
was
at
the
club
last
night
i
thought
i
would
call
after
breakfast
and
learn
the
extent
of
the
illness
if
you
want
to
send
a
message
or
note
i
can
deliver
it
that
was
the
beginning
of
dreary
days
ruth
prepared
her
note
a
tender
comforting
one
but
it
was
brought
back
to
her
and
as
her
father
handed
it
to
her
he
said
he
ca
read
it
now
daughter
i
dare
say
it
would
comfort
him
if
he
could
but
he
is
delirious
did
know
me
has
known
any
one
since
he
was
taken
in
the
night
keep
the
letter
till
this
passes
off
then
he
will
be
ready
for
it
very
kind
and
sympathetic
were
ruth
friends
the
girls
came
to
see
her
and
kissed
her
wistfully
with
tears
in
their
eyes
but
they
had
little
to
say
they
knew
just
how
sick
her
friend
was
and
they
felt
as
though
there
was
nothing
left
to
say
her
father
neglected
his
business
to
stay
at
home
with
her
and
in
many
a
little
thoughtful
way
touched
her
heavy
heart
as
the
hours
dragged
by
not
many
hours
to
wait
it
was
in
the
early
dawn
of
the
third
morning
after
the
news
had
reached
her
that
the
pealed
sharply
through
the
house
there
was
but
one
servant
up
she
answered
the
bell
ruth
was
up
and
dressed
and
stood
in
the
hall
above
listening
for
what
that
bell
might
bring
to
her
she
heard
the
hurried
voice
at
the
door
heard
the
peremptory
order
i
want
to
see
judge
erskine
right
away
she
knew
the
voice
belonged
to
nellis
mitchell
and
she
went
down
to
him
in
the
library
he
turned
swiftly
at
the
opening
of
the
door
then
stood
still
and
a
look
of
blank
dismay
swept
over
his
face
it
was
your
father
that
i
wanted
to
see
he
said
quickly
i
know
she
answered
speaking
in
her
usual
tone
i
heard
your
message
my
father
has
not
yet
risen
he
will
be
down
presently
meantime
i
thought
you
might
possibly
have
news
of
condition
can
you
tell
me
what
your
father
thinks
of
him
this
morning
how
very
quiet
and
composed
she
was
it
seemed
impossible
to
realize
that
she
was
the
promised
wife
of
the
man
for
whom
she
was
asking
nellis
mitchell
was
distressed
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
or
do
his
distress
showed
itself
plainly
on
his
face
you
need
not
be
afraid
to
tell
me
she
said
half
smiling
and
speaking
more
gently
than
she
was
apt
to
speak
to
this
young
man
it
almost
seemed
that
she
was
trying
to
sustain
him
and
help
him
to
tell
his
story
i
am
not
a
child
you
know
she
added
still
with
a
smile
you
do
not
know
what
you
are
talking
about
he
said
hoarsely
ruth
wo
you
please
go
and
tell
your
father
i
want
him
as
soon
as
possible
she
turned
from
him
half
impatiently
my
father
will
be
down
as
soon
as
possible
she
said
coldly
he
is
not
accustomed
to
keep
gentlemen
waiting
beyond
what
is
necessary
meantime
if
you
know
will
you
be
kind
enough
to
give
me
news
of
wayne
i
beg
you
mitchell
to
remember
that
i
am
not
a
silly
child
to
whom
you
need
be
afraid
to
give
a
message
if
you
have
one
he
must
answer
her
now
there
was
no
escape
he
is
he
began
and
then
he
stopped
and
her
clear
cold
grave
eyes
looked
right
at
him
and
waited
his
next
sentence
commenced
almost
in
a
moan
oh
ruth
you
make
me
tell
you
it
is
all
over
he
has
gone
gone
she
repeated
incredulously
still
staring
at
him
where
is
he
gone
what
an
awful
question
she
realized
it
herself
almost
the
instant
it
passed
her
lips
it
made
her
shudder
visibly
but
she
neither
screamed
nor
fainted
nor
in
any
way
except
that
strange
one
betrayed
emotion
instead
she
said
be
seated
mitchell
and
excuse
me
father
is
coming
then
she
turned
and
went
back
he
heard
her
firm
step
on
the
stairs
as
she
went
slowly
up
and
this
poor
bearer
of
faithful
tidings
shut
his
face
into
both
his
hands
and
groaned
aloud
for
such
misery
as
could
not
vent
itself
in
any
natural
way
he
understood
that
there
was
something
more
than
ordinary
sorrow
in
ruth
face
it
was
as
if
she
had
been
petrified
through
the
days
that
followed
ruth
passed
as
one
in
a
dream
everyone
was
very
kind
her
father
showed
a
talent
for
patience
and
gentleness
that
no
one
had
known
he
possessed
the
girls
came
to
see
her
but
she
would
not
be
seen
she
shrank
from
them
they
did
not
wonder
at
that
they
were
half
relieved
that
it
was
so
such
a
pall
seemed
to
them
to
have
settled
suddenly
over
her
life
that
they
felt
at
a
loss
what
to
say
how
to
meet
her
so
when
she
sent
to
them
from
her
darkened
and
gloomy
room
kind
messages
of
thanks
for
their
kindness
and
asked
them
to
further
show
their
sympathy
by
allowing
her
to
stay
utterly
alone
for
awhile
they
drew
relieved
sighs
and
went
away
this
much
they
understood
it
was
not
a
time
for
words
as
for
flossy
she
should
not
have
been
numbered
among
them
she
did
not
call
at
all
she
sent
by
nellis
mitchell
a
tiny
bouquet
of
lilies
of
the
valley
lying
inside
of
a
cool
broad
green
lily
leaf
and
on
a
slip
of
paper
twisted
in
with
it
was
written
yea
though
i
walk
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
i
will
fear
no
evil
how
ruth
blessed
her
for
that
word
verily
she
felt
that
she
was
walking
through
the
very
blackest
of
the
shadows
it
reminded
her
that
she
had
a
friend
slowly
the
hours
dragged
on
the
grand
and
solemn
funeral
was
planned
and
the
plans
carried
out
wayne
was
among
the
very
wealthy
of
the
city
his
father
mansion
was
shrouded
in
its
appropriate
crape
the
rooms
and
the
halls
and
the
rich
dark
solemn
coffin
glittering
with
its
solid
silver
screws
and
handles
were
almost
hidden
in
rare
and
costly
flowers
ruth
in
the
deepest
of
mourning
robes
accompanied
by
her
father
from
whose
shoulder
swept
long
streamers
of
crape
sat
in
the
erskine
carriage
and
followed
directly
after
the
hearse
chief
mourner
in
the
long
and
solemn
train
in
every
conceivable
way
that
love
could
devise
and
wealth
carry
out
were
the
last
tokens
of
respect
paid
to
the
quiet
clay
that
understood
not
what
was
passing
around
it
the
music
was
by
the
quartette
choir
of
the
first
church
and
was
like
a
wail
of
angel
voices
in
its
wonderful
pathos
and
tenderness
the
pastor
spoke
a
few
words
tenderly
solemnly
pointing
the
mourners
to
one
who
alone
could
sustain
earnestly
urging
those
who
knew
nothing
of
the
love
of
christ
to
take
refuge
in
his
open
arms
and
find
rest
there
but
alas
alas
not
a
single
word
could
he
say
about
the
soul
that
had
gone
out
from
that
silent
body
before
them
gone
to
live
forever
was
it
possible
for
those
holding
such
belief
as
theirs
to
have
a
shadow
of
hope
that
the
end
of
such
a
life
as
his
had
been
could
be
bright
not
one
of
those
who
understood
anything
about
this
matter
dared
for
an
instant
to
hope
it
they
understood
the
awful
solemn
silence
of
the
minister
there
was
nothing
for
that
grave
but
silence
hope
for
the
living
and
he
pointed
them
earnestly
to
the
source
of
all
hope
but
for
the
dead
silence
what
an
awfully
solemn
task
to
conduct
such
funeral
services
the
pastor
may
not
read
the
comforting
words
blessed
are
the
dead
who
die
in
the
lord
because
before
them
lies
one
who
did
not
die
in
the
lord
and
common
sense
tells
the
most
thoughtless
that
if
those
are
blessed
who
die
in
the
lord
there
must
be
a
reverse
side
to
the
picture
else
no
sense
to
the
statement
so
the
verse
must
be
passed
by
it
is
too
late
to
help
the
dead
and
it
need
not
tear
the
hearts
of
the
living
he
can
not
read
i
shall
go
to
him
but
he
shall
not
return
to
me
god
forbid
prays
the
sad
pastor
in
his
heart
that
mother
or
father
or
friend
shall
so
die
as
to
go
to
this
one
who
did
not
die
in
the
lord
we
can
not
even
hope
for
that
all
the
long
line
of
tender
helpful
verses
glowing
with
light
for
the
coming
morning
shining
with
immortality
and
unending
union
must
be
passed
by
for
each
and
every
one
of
them
have
a
clause
which
shows
unmistakably
that
the
immortality
is
glorious
only
under
certain
conditions
and
in
this
case
they
have
not
been
met
there
must
in
these
verses
too
be
a
reverse
side
or
else
they
mean
nothing
what
shall
the
pastor
do
clearly
he
can
only
say
in
the
midst
of
life
we
are
in
death
that
is
true
his
audience
feel
it
and
he
can
only
pray
so
teach
to
number
our
days
that
we
may
apply
our
hearts
unto
wisdom
but
oh
how
the
mothers
stand
by
open
graves
wherein
are
laid
their
sons
or
daughters
and
endure
the
thought
that
it
is
a
separation
that
shall
stretch
through
eternity
how
wonderful
that
any
of
us
are
careless
or
thoughtless
for
a
moment
so
long
as
we
have
a
child
or
a
friend
unsafe
during
all
this
time
of
trial
ruth
three
friends
were
hovering
around
her
trying
by
every
possible
attention
and
thoughtfulness
to
help
or
comfort
her
and
yet
feeling
their
powerlessness
in
such
a
way
that
it
almost
made
them
shrink
from
trying
words
are
such
a
mockery
marion
said
to
her
one
evening
as
they
sat
together
sometimes
i
almost
hate
myself
for
trying
to
speak
to
you
at
all
what
can
any
human
being
say
to
one
who
is
shrouded
in
an
awful
sorrow
ruth
shuddered
visibly
it
an
sorrow
she
said
you
have
used
the
right
word
with
which
to
express
it
but
there
is
a
shade
to
it
that
you
do
not
understand
i
do
believe
that
by
experience
you
ever
will
i
pray
god
that
you
may
not
think
of
burying
a
friend
in
the
grave
without
the
slightest
hope
of
ever
meeting
him
in
peace
again
you
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
ruth
god
is
the
judge
i
do
think
you
ought
to
allow
yourself
to
think
of
it
there
i
think
you
are
mistaken
i
believe
i
ought
to
think
of
it
marion
you
know
and
know
that
there
is
simply
nothing
at
all
on
which
to
build
a
hope
of
meeting
in
peace
the
man
we
buried
last
week
you
think
it
almost
shocking
that
i
can
speak
of
him
in
that
way
i
know
you
do
people
are
apt
to
hide
behind
the
very
flimsiest
veil
of
fancied
hopes
when
they
talk
of
such
things
perhaps
a
merciful
god
permits
some
to
hug
a
worthless
hope
when
they
think
of
their
dead
treasures
since
it
can
do
no
harm
to
those
who
are
gone
but
i
am
not
one
of
that
class
of
people
besides
i
am
appearing
to
you
and
everybody
in
a
false
light
i
am
tired
of
it
marion
wayne
was
not
to
me
what
he
ought
to
have
been
since
i
was
his
promised
wife
you
know
how
i
have
changed
of
late
you
know
there
was
hardly
a
thought
or
feeling
of
mine
in
which
he
could
sympathize
but
the
worst
of
it
is
he
never
did
sympathize
with
me
in
the
true
sense
he
never
filled
my
heart
my
promise
to
him
was
one
of
those
false
steps
that
people
like
me
who
are
ruled
by
society
take
because
it
seems
to
be
the
proper
thing
to
do
next
or
because
we
feel
it
might
as
well
be
that
as
anything
perhaps
because
it
will
please
one
father
in
a
business
point
of
view
or
please
one
own
sense
of
importance
satisfy
one
desire
to
be
foremost
in
the
fashionable
world
i
am
humiliating
myself
to
tell
you
plainly
that
my
promise
meant
not
much
more
than
that
i
did
not
realize
how
empty
it
was
till
i
found
that
all
my
plans
and
aims
and
hopes
in
life
were
changed
that
in
short
life
had
come
to
seem
more
to
me
than
a
glittering
weariness
that
was
to
be
borne
with
the
best
grace
i
could
assume
this
was
nearly
all
i
had
found
in
society
or
hoped
to
find
i
followed
wayne
to
the
grave
in
the
position
of
chief
mourner
because
i
felt
that
it
was
a
token
of
respect
that
i
owed
to
the
memory
of
the
man
whom
i
had
wronged
and
because
i
felt
that
the
world
had
no
business
with
our
private
affairs
but
he
was
not
to
me
what
people
think
he
was
and
i
feel
as
though
i
wanted
you
to
know
it
even
though
it
humiliates
me
beyond
measure
to
make
the
confession
at
the
same
time
i
have
an
awful
sorrow
too
awful
to
be
expressed
in
words
marion
i
think
you
will
understand
what
i
mean
when
i
say
that
i
believe
i
have
the
blood
of
a
lost
soul
clinging
to
my
garments
i
know
as
well
as
i
sit
here
that
i
might
have
influenced
harold
wayne
into
the
right
way
i
know
his
love
for
me
was
so
sincere
and
so
strong
that
he
would
have
been
willing
to
try
to
do
almost
anything
that
i
had
asked
i
believe
in
my
soul
that
had
i
urged
the
matter
of
personal
salvation
on
his
immediate
attention
he
would
have
given
it
thought
but
i
did
marion
even
on
that
last
evening
of
his
life
i
mean
before
he
was
sick
when
he
himself
invited
the
words
i
was
silent
i
did
not
mean
to
continue
so
i
meant
when
i
got
ready
to
speak
to
him
about
this
matter
i
meant
to
do
everything
right
but
i
was
determined
to
take
my
own
time
for
it
and
i
took
it
and
now
he
is
marion
you
know
nothing
about
such
a
sorrow
as
that
now
why
did
i
act
in
this
insane
way
i
know
the
reason
one
of
them
at
least
and
the
awful
selfishness
and
cowardice
of
it
only
brands
me
deeper
it
was
because
i
was
afraid
to
have
him
become
a
christian
man
i
knew
if
he
did
i
should
have
no
excuse
for
breaking
the
pledges
that
had
passed
between
us
in
plain
words
i
would
have
no
excuse
for
not
marrying
him
and
i
did
not
want
to
do
it
i
felt
that
marriage
vows
would
mean
to
me
in
the
future
what
they
never
meant
in
the
past
and
that
there
was
really
nothing
in
common
between
wayne
and
myself
that
i
could
not
assent
to
the
marriage
service
with
him
and
be
guiltless
before
god
so
to
spare
myself
to
have
what
looked
like
a
conscientious
excuse
for
breaking
vows
that
ought
never
to
have
been
made
i
deliberately
sacrificed
his
marion
wilbur
think
of
that
you
did
mean
to
do
that
marion
said
in
an
voice
she
was
astonished
and
shocked
and
bewildered
as
to
what
to
say
ruth
answered
her
almost
fiercely
no
i
did
mean
to
and
as
to
that
i
never
meant
to
do
anything
that
was
not
just
right
in
my
life
but
i
meant
to
have
just
exactly
my
own
way
of
doing
things
and
i
tell
you
i
took
it
now
marion
while
i
blame
myself
as
no
other
person
ever
can
i
still
blame
others
i
was
never
taught
as
i
should
have
been
about
the
sacredness
of
human
loves
and
the
awfulness
of
human
vows
and
pledges
i
was
never
taught
that
for
girls
to
dally
with
such
pledges
to
flirt
with
them
before
they
knew
anything
about
life
or
about
their
own
hearts
was
a
sin
in
the
sight
of
god
i
ought
to
have
been
so
taught
perhaps
if
i
had
had
a
mother
to
teach
me
i
should
have
been
different
but
i
am
not
even
sure
of
that
mothers
seem
to
me
to
allow
strange
trifling
with
these
subjects
even
if
they
do
not
actually
prepare
the
way
but
all
this
does
not
relieve
me
i
have
sinned
no
one
but
myself
understands
how
deeply
and
no
one
but
me
knows
the
bitterness
of
it
now
i
feel
as
though
the
whole
of
the
rest
of
my
life
must
be
given
to
atone
for
this
horrible
fatal
mistake
i
wasted
the
last
hour
i
ever
had
with
a
soul
and
i
have
before
me
the
awful
consciousness
that
i
might
have
saved
it
it
is
all
done
now
and
can
never
be
undone
that
is
the
saddest
part
of
it
but
there
is
one
thing
i
can
do
i
need
never
live
through
a
like
experience
again
i
will
give
the
rest
of
my
life
to
atone
for
the
past
i
will
never
again
be
guilty
of
coming
in
contact
with
a
soul
unprepared
for
death
without
urging
upon
that
soul
as
often
as
i
have
opportunity
the
necessity
for
preparation
i
see
plainly
that
it
is
the
important
thing
in
life
there
hovered
over
marion
mind
while
these
last
sentences
were
being
spoken
words
something
like
these
the
blood
of
jesus
christ
his
son
cleanseth
from
all
sin
she
almost
said
to
ruth
that
even
for
this
sin
the
atonement
had
been
made
she
must
not
try
to
make
another
but
the
error
that
only
faintly
glimmered
in
ruth
sentence
was
so
mixed
with
solemn
and
helpful
truth
that
she
felt
at
a
loss
as
to
whether
there
was
error
at
all
and
so
held
her
peace

revival
as
the
early
autumn
months
slipped
away
and
touches
of
winter
began
to
show
around
them
it
became
evident
that
a
new
feeling
was
stirring
in
the
first
church
no
need
now
to
work
for
increased
numbers
at
the
at
least
there
was
not
the
need
that
formerly
existed
the
room
was
full
and
the
meetings
solemn
and
earnest
the
spirit
of
god
was
hovering
over
the
place
drops
of
the
coming
shower
were
already
beginning
to
fall
what
was
the
cause
of
the
quickened
hearts
who
knew
save
the
watcher
on
the
tower
in
the
eternal
city
was
it
because
of
the
sudden
and
solemn
and
hopeless
death
occurring
in
the
very
center
of
what
was
called
the
first
circles
was
it
the
spirit
developed
apparently
by
this
death
showing
itself
in
eager
indefatigable
effort
wherever
ruth
erskine
went
with
whomsoever
she
came
in
contact
was
it
marion

new
way
of
teaching
that
included
not
only
the
intellect
of
her
pupils
but
looked
beyond
that
with
loving
word
for
the
empty
soul
was
it
eurie
mitchell
patient
way
of
taking
up
home
work
and
care
that
had
been
distasteful
to
her
and
that
she
had
shunned
in
days
gone
by
was
it
flossy
shipley
way
of
teaching
the
lessons
to
those
boys
of
hers
was
it
the
quickened
sense
which
throbbed
in
the
almost
discouraged
heart
of
the
pastor
whenever
he
came
in
contact
with
either
of
these
four
was
it
the
patient
persistent
unassuming
work
of
john
warden
as
he
went
about
in
the
shop
among
his
dropping
an
earnest
word
here
a
pressing
invitation
there
who
shall
tell
whether
either
or
all
of
these
influences
combined
with
hundreds
of
others
set
in
motion
by
like
causes
were
the
beginnings
of
the
solemn
and
blessed
harvest
time
that
dawned
at
last
on
those
who
had
been
sowing
in
tears
the
fact
was
apparent
even
in
the
first
church
that
model
of
propriety
and
respectability
that
church
which
had
so
feared
excitement
or
unusual
efforts
of
sort
there
was
a
revival
among
those
who
were
coming
and
who
were
growing
willing
to
let
others
know
that
they
were
awakening
to
a
sense
of
the
importance
of
these
things
were
and
mitchell
eurie
father
and
mother
to
themselves
they
did
not
hesitate
to
say
that
the
change
in
eurie
was
so
marked
and
so
increasing
in
its
power
over
her
life
that
it
obliged
them
to
think
seriously
of
this
thing
among
the
interested
also
were
a
score
or
more
of
girls
from
room
in
the
great
school
and
more
came
every
day
marion
face
was
shining
and
she
gathered
her
brood
about
her
as
a
mother
would
the
children
of
her
love
and
longing
among
them
were
four
of
flossy
boys
and
half
a
dozen
boys
friends
of
theirs
who
were
not
flossy
and
who
yet
someway
joined
her
train
and
managed
to
be
counted
in
among
them
was
judge
erskine
i
mean
among
those
who
continued
to
come
to
the
meetings
coming
alone
and
being
reverent
and
thoughtful
during
the
services
but
going
away
with
bowed
head
and
making
no
sign
there
was
something
in
the
way
with
judge
erskine
that
no
one
understood
as
for
ruth
how
she
worked
during
these
days
not
with
a
glad
light
in
her
eyes
such
as
marion
and
flossy
had
not
with
a
satisfied
face
as
if
the
question
of
something
to
do
that
was
worth
doing
and
that
helped
her
had
been
settled
such
as
eurie
mitchell
wore
rather
with
a
sad
feverish
impatience
to
accomplish
shrinking
from
nothing
willing
to
do
anything
go
anywhere
yet
meeting
with
far
less
encouragement
and
seeing
far
less
fruits
than
any
of
the
others
she
did
not
realize
that
she
was
working
with
a
sort
of
desperate
intention
of
overbalancing
the
mischief
of
her
mistakes
by
so
much
work
now
that
there
would
be
a
sort
of
even
balance
at
the
scales
she
would
have
been
shocked
had
she
understood
her
own
heart
meantime
where
was
satan
content
to
let
this
reaping
time
alone
oh
bless
you
no
never
busier
never
more
alert
and
watchful
and
cautious
and
than
now
it
was
wonderful
too
how
many
helpers
he
found
whose
names
were
actually
on
the
roll
of
the
first
church
there
were
those
who
had
had
in
mind
all
the
fall
having
little
entertainments
just
a
few
friends
you
know
nothing
like
a
party
they
were
sorry
to
be
obliged
to
have
them
just
now
while
there
were
meetings
but
miss
gilmore
was
in
town
and
would
be
here
so
short
a
time
they
invite
her
it
would
not
be
treating
her
well
to
take
no
notice
of
her
visit
and
really
the
people
whom
they
proposed
to
invite
were
those
who
did
not
attend
church
so
no
harm
could
be
done
these
were
some
of
satan
helpers
there
were
others
who
were
more
outspoken
they
did
not
believe
in
special
efforts
seasons
of
excitement
religious
dissipations
nothing
else
people
should
be
religious
at
all
times
not
put
it
on
for
special
occasions
it
was
well
enough
to
have
a
special
season
for
parties
and
a
special
season
for
going
to
the
and
a
special
season
for
doing
dressmaking
and
a
special
season
for
cleaning
house
and
a
special
season
for
everything
under
the
sun
but
religious
meetings
these
should
be
conducted
at
all
times
was
that
what
they
meant
oh
dear
no
they
should
not
be
conducted
at
all
was
what
they
meant
who
should
tell
what
they
mean
one
lady
said
the
idea
of
the
bell
ringing
every
evening
for
it
was
too
absurd
people
must
have
a
little
time
for
recreation
these
weeks
just
before
the
holidays
were
always
by
common
consent
the
time
for
festivities
of
all
sorts
it
was
downright
folly
to
expect
young
people
to
give
up
their
pleasures
and
go
every
evening
to
meeting
so
she
issued
her
cards
for
a
party
and
gathered
as
many
of
the
young
people
about
her
as
she
could
and
this
woman
was
a
member
of
the
first
church
and
this
woman
professed
to
believe
in
the
verse
that
read
whether
therefore
ye
eat
or
drink
or
whatever
ye
do
do
all
to
the
glory
of
god
there
were
others
who
went
to
these
parties
hushing
their
consciences
meantime
by
the
explanation
that
the
social
duties
were
important
ones
and
that
one
whose
heart
was
right
could
serve
god
as
well
having
religious
conversation
at
a
party
as
she
could
occupying
a
seat
at
a
perhaps
they
really
believed
it
what
marvel
satan
himself
is
transformed
into
an
angel
of
light
the
trouble
about
the
sincerity
was
that
those
same
persons
were
not
unaware
of
certain
sneering
remarks
that
were
being
made
to
the
effect
that
if
could
go
to
parties
when
there
were
meetings
at
their
own
church
could
surely
be
excused
from
the
meetings
and
they
could
not
have
been
utterly
ignorant
of
the
verse
that
read
plainly
let
not
your
good
be
evil
spoken
of
there
were
still
others
who
compromised
matters
taking
the
meetings
for
the
first
hour
of
the
evening
and
a
party
for
the
next
three
and
the
said
sneeringly
that
there
was
a
strife
going
on
between
the
soul
the
flesh
and
the
devil
and
they
wondered
which
would
conquer
so
all
these
classes
flourished
and
worked
in
their
different
ways
in
the
first
church
just
as
they
always
work
until
that
day
when
the
wheat
shall
be
forever
separated
from
the
tares
the
wonder
is
why
so
many
blinded
eyes
insist
that
because
there
are
tares
there
is
therefore
no
wheat
the
lord
said
let
both
grow
together
until
the
harvest
i
do
understand
it
ruth
said
one
day
to
marion
as
they
talked
the
work
over
and
tried
to
lay
plans
for
future
helpfulness
why
do
you
suppose
it
is
that
i
seem
able
to
do
nothing
at
all
i
try
with
all
my
might
my
heart
is
surely
in
it
and
i
long
with
a
desire
that
seems
almost
as
if
it
would
consume
me
to
see
some
fruit
of
my
work
and
yet
i
do
what
be
the
difficulty
i
do
know
marion
said
speaking
hesitatingly
as
one
who
would
like
to
say
more
if
she
dared
i
do
feel
competent
to
answer
that
question
and
yet
sometimes
i
have
feared
that
you
might
be
trying
to
compromise
with
the
lord
i
do
understand
you
in
what
way
do
you
mean
i
try
to
do
my
duty
in
every
place
that
i
can
think
of
i
am
not
compromising
on
any
subject
so
far
as
i
know
if
i
am
i
will
certainly
be
grateful
to
anyone
who
will
point
it
out
to
me
i
am
not
sure
that
it
is
sufficiently
clear
to
my
own
mind
to
be
able
to
point
it
out
marion
said
still
visibly
embarrassed
but
ruth
it
sometimes
seems
to
me
as
if
you
had
said
to
yourself
i
will
work
so
much
and
pray
so
much
and
then
i
ought
to
have
rest
from
the
pain
that
is
goading
me
on
and
i
ought
to
be
able
to
feel
that
i
have
atoned
for
past
mistakes
and
the
account
against
me
is
squared
ruth
turned
from
her
impatiently
you
are
a
strange
comforter
she
said
almost
indignantly
do
you
mean
by
that
to
intimate
that
you
think
i
ought
to
look
or
hope
for
rest
of
mind
again
because
i
have
made
one
fearful
mistake
do
you
mean
that
i
ought
always
to
carry
with
me
the
sense
of
the
burden
i
mean
no
such
thing
you
can
not
think
i
so
estimate
the
power
of
the
sacrifice
for
sin
ruth
i
mean
simply
this
nothing
that
you
or
i
can
do
can
possibly
make
one
sin
white
one
mistake
as
though
it
had
not
been
give
one
moment
of
rest
to
a
troubled
heart
but
the
blood
of
jesus
christ
can
do
all
this
and
it
does
seem
to
me
that
you
are
ignoring
it
and
trying
to
work
out
your
own
rest
ruth
was
thoughtful
the
look
of
vexation
passed
from
her
face
it
may
be
so
she
said
after
a
long
silence
i
begin
dimly
to
understand
your
meaning
but
i
do
know
how
to
help
it
how
to
feel
differently
i
surely
ought
to
work
and
surely
i
have
a
right
to
expect
results
in
one
sense
yes
and
in
another
i
do
believe
we
have
i
begin
to
feel
more
and
more
that
you
and
i
have
in
some
way
to
be
made
to
understand
that
it
is
not
our
way
but
the
lord
that
we
must
be
willing
to
do
or
what
is
harder
to
leave
undone
exactly
what
he
says
or
do
i
ca
help
feeling
that
you
are
planning
in
your
own
heart
just
what
ought
to
be
done
and
then
allowing
yourself
to
feel
almost
indignant
and
because
the
work
is
not
accomplished
i
do
know
how
you
have
succeeded
in
seeing
so
deeply
into
my
heart
ruth
said
with
a
wan
smile
i
believe
it
is
so
though
i
am
not
sure
that
i
ever
saw
it
before
i
know
why
i
see
it
because
it
is
my
temptation
as
well
as
yours
you
and
i
are
both
we
have
both
been
used
to
having
our
own
way
we
want
to
continue
to
have
it
we
want
to
do
the
right
things
provided
we
can
have
the
choosing
of
them
flossy
now
with
her
yielding
nature
is
willing
to
as
you
and
i
are
not
i
have
to
fight
against
this
tendency
to
carry
out
my
plans
and
look
for
results
all
the
time
the
fact
is
ruth
we
must
learn
to
work
for
and
not
set
up
business
for
ourselves
and
still
expect
him
to
give
the
wages
still
said
ruth
i
do
know
there
seems
to
me
to
be
nothing
that
i
am
not
willing
to
do
i
ca
think
of
anything
so
hard
that
i
would
not
unhesitatingly
do
it
i
have
changed
wonderfully
in
that
respect
a
little
while
ago
i
was
not
willing
to
do
anything
now
i
am
ready
for
anything
that
can
be
done
are
you
marion
asked
with
a
visible
shiver
ruth
are
you
i
ca
say
that
i
want
to
say
it
and
i
pray
that
i
may
be
able
yet
i
can
think
of
so
many
things
that
i
might
be
called
on
to
do
that
i
shrink
from
i
have
given
up
trying
to
do
them
and
fallen
back
on
the
promise
grace
is
sufficient
only
praying
give
me
the
needed
grace
for
i
will
not
reach
out
for
and
ruth
i
feel
sure
that
neither
you
nor
i
must
try
to
cover
our
past
errors
with
present
usefulness
nothing
but
the
blood
of
christ
can
cover
wrong
we
rest
on
that
and
on
that
alone
i
believe
i
only
understand
in
part
what
you
mean
i
do
see
how
you
ever
reached
so
far
ahead
of
me
in
faith
and
in
understanding
but
i
believe
you
farther
still
i
ca
think
of
anything
that
i
am
not
willing
and
ready
to
do
i
wish
i
might
be
tried
i
wish
he
would
give
me
some
work
not
of
my
own
planning
that
he
might
see
how
willing
i
am
to
do
anything
this
was
ruth
last
remark
to
her
friend
that
evening
flossy
and
eurie
both
came
in
and
they
went
out
to
the
meeting
together
ruth
thinking
still
of
the
talk
they
had
and
feeling
sure
that
she
could
do
whatever
she
found
and
yet
the
master
was
planning
a
way
for
her
that
very
evening
the
entrance
to
which
she
had
never
seen
never
dreamed
of
as
possible
so
many
ways
he
has
for
leading
us
blessed
are
those
who
have
come
to
the
experience
that
makes
them
willing
to
be
led
even
in
darkness
and
blindness
trusting
to
the
sun
of
righteousness
for
light

chapter
xxiii
the
strange
story
judge
erskine
was
in
his
library
pacing
slowly
back
and
forth
his
forehead
lined
with
heavy
wrinkles
and
his
face
wearing
the
expression
of
one
involved
in
deep
and
troubled
thought
he
had
just
come
home
from
the
evening
meeting
the
last
meeting
of
the
series
that
had
held
the
attention
of
so
many
hearts
during
four
weeks
of
harvest
time
judge
erskine
had
been
a
silent
and
attentive
listener
all
through
the
solemnities
of
the
sermon
that
seemed
written
for
his
sake
and
to
point
right
at
him
he
had
never
moved
his
keen
steady
eyes
away
from
the
preacher
face
the
text
of
that
sermon
he
was
not
likely
to
forget
he
had
looked
it
up
and
read
it
with
its
connections
the
moment
he
reached
the
privacy
of
his
library
the
harvest
is
past
the
summer
is
ended
and
we
are
not
saved
that
was
the
text
judge
erskine
said
it
over
and
over
to
his
own
soul
it
was
true
it
fitted
his
condition
as
precisely
as
though
it
had
been
written
for
him
the
harvest
that
would
tell
for
eternity
had
been
reaped
all
around
him
he
had
looked
and
listened
and
resolved
and
still
he
stood
outside
ungarnered
moreover
one
portion
of
the
solemn
sermon
fitted
him
also
when
dennis
spoke
of
those
who
had
let
this
season
pass
unhelped
because
they
had
an
inner
life
that
would
not
bear
the
gaze
of
the
public
because
they
were
not
willing
to
drag
out
their
past
and
cast
it
away
from
them
judge
erskine
had
started
and
fixed
a
stern
glance
on
the
preacher
did
he
know
his
secret
that
had
been
hidden
away
with
such
persistent
care
what
scoundrel
could
have
enlightened
him
this
only
for
a
moment
then
he
settled
back
and
realized
his
folly
dennis
knew
nothing
of
himself
or
his
past
then
came
that
other
awfully
solemn
thought
there
was
one
who
did
could
it
be
that
his
voice
had
instructed
the
pastor
what
special
point
to
make
in
that
sermon
with
such
emphasis
and
power
was
the
keen
eye
of
the
eternal
god
pointing
his
finger
now
at
him
and
saying
thou
art
the
man
he
all
this
was
true
he
knew
that
the
work
of
the
past
month
had
greatly
moved
him
he
knew
on
the
evening
when
the
text
had
been
almost
thou
persuadest
to
be
a
christian
that
he
had
felt
himself
persuaded
he
knew
then
as
he
did
now
that
but
one
thing
stood
in
the
way
of
his
entire
persuasion
as
he
walked
up
and
down
his
library
on
this
evening
he
felt
fully
persuaded
in
his
own
mind
that
the
time
had
arrived
when
he
was
being
called
on
persistently
for
a
decision
more
than
that
he
felt
that
the
decision
was
to
be
not
only
for
time
but
for
eternity
that
he
settle
the
question
of
his
future
then
and
there
he
had
locked
the
door
after
him
as
he
came
into
the
library
with
a
sort
of
grim
determination
to
settle
the
question
before
he
stepped
into
the
outside
world
again
how
would
it
be
settled
he
did
not
know
himself
he
did
not
dare
to
think
how
it
would
end
he
simply
felt
that
the
conflict
must
end
meantime
ruth
was
on
her
knees
praying
for
her
father
her
heart
felt
very
heavy
she
had
prayed
for
this
father
with
all
her
soul
prayed
with
what
she
felt
was
a
degree
of
faith
that
this
evening
at
the
meeting
he
might
settle
the
question
at
issue
and
settle
it
forever
she
had
felt
a
bitter
and
almost
an
overwhelming
disappointment
that
the
meeting
closed
and
left
him
just
where
he
had
stood
for
a
month
there
seemed
nothing
left
to
do
she
had
not
spared
her
words
her
entreaties
she
had
gotten
bravely
over
her
fears
of
approaching
her
father
but
now
it
seemed
to
her
that
there
was
nothing
left
to
say
she
could
still
pray
and
it
was
with
a
cry
that
she
fell
on
her
knees
realizing
in
her
very
soul
that
only
the
power
of
god
could
convert
her
father
into
the
midst
of
this
longing
clinging
cry
for
help
there
came
a
knock
judge
erskine
would
like
to
have
you
come
to
the
library
for
a
few
minutes
if
you
have
not
retired
this
was
katie
flinn
message
and
ruth
as
she
swiftly
set
about
obeying
the
summons
said
oh
katie
pray
for
father
for
among
those
who
during
the
last
few
weeks
had
learned
to
pray
was
katie
flinn
poor
katie
with
the
simple
faith
and
loving
heart
which
she
brought
to
the
service
was
destined
to
be
a
shining
light
in
a
dark
world
and
the
glory
thereof
would
sparkle
forever
in
flossy
shipley
crown
judge
erskine
turned
as
his
daughter
opened
the
door
and
motioned
her
to
a
seat
then
he
continued
his
walk
something
in
his
face
hushed
into
silence
the
words
that
were
on
her
lips
but
presently
he
stopped
before
her
and
his
voice
startled
her
with
its
strangeness
my
daughter
i
have
something
to
tell
you
and
something
to
ask
you
i
shall
have
to
cause
you
great
grief
and
shame
and
i
want
to
begin
first
by
asking
you
to
forgive
your
father
ruth
felt
her
face
growing
pale
what
he
mean
had
she
not
always
looked
up
to
him
as
above
most
men
even
christian
men
faultless
in
his
business
transactions
blameless
in
his
life
she
attempted
to
speak
and
yet
felt
that
she
did
not
know
what
to
say
apparently
he
expected
no
word
from
her
for
he
went
on
hurriedly
you
have
during
these
few
weeks
past
shown
a
sort
of
interest
in
me
that
i
never
saw
manifested
before
i
have
reason
to
think
that
you
have
concluded
lately
that
the
most
earnest
desire
you
can
have
concerning
your
father
is
to
see
him
a
christian
man
i
can
conscientiously
tell
you
that
i
have
felt
the
necessity
for
this
experience
as
i
never
did
before
that
i
realize
its
importance
and
that
i
want
it
yet
there
is
something
in
the
way
something
that
i
must
do
and
confess
and
abide
by
for
the
future
that
i
shrink
from
more
on
your
account
than
my
own
my
child
do
you
want
this
thing
enough
to
endure
disgrace
and
humiliation
and
a
cross
heavy
and
hopeless
all
your
life
father
she
said
half
rising
and
looking
at
him
with
a
bewildered
air
a
vague
doubt
of
his
sanity
and
a
half
fear
of
his
presence
creeping
into
her
heart
what
can
you
possibly
mean
how
can
disgrace
or
or
trouble
of
any
sort
be
connected
with
i
can
not
understand
you
i
know
you
can
not
you
think
i
am
talking
wildly
and
you
are
half
afraid
of
me
but
i
am
perfectly
sane
i
wish
with
all
my
soul
that
a
certain
portion
of
my
life
could
be
called
a
wild
dream
of
a
disordered
brain
but
it
is
solemnly
true
ruth
if
i
come
out
before
the
world
and
avow
myself
a
christian
man
with
the
determination
to
abide
by
the
teachings
of
the
lord
jesus
christ
it
involves
my
bringing
to
this
house
a
woman
who
will
have
to
be
recognized
as
my
wife
and
a
girl
who
will
have
to
share
with
you
as
my
daughter
a
woman
whom
you
will
have
to
call
mother
and
a
girl
who
is
your
sister
are
you
equal
to
that
every
trace
of
blood
left
ruth
erskine
face
her
father
watched
her
narrowly
with
his
hand
touching
the
it
seemed
as
if
she
must
faint
but
she
motioned
his
hand
away
do
ring
were
the
first
words
she
said
i
am
not
going
to
faint
father
tell
me
what
you
mean
the
actual
avowal
made
and
the
fact
established
that
his
daughter
was
able
to
bear
it
and
to
still
keep
the
story
between
themselves
seemed
to
quiet
judge
erskine
his
intense
and
almost
uncontrollable
excitement
subsided
the
wild
look
in
his
eyes
calmed
and
drawing
a
chair
beside
his
daughter
he
began
in
a
low
steady
voice
to
tell
her
the
strange
story
acts
that
involve
a
lifetime
of
trouble
can
be
told
in
a
few
words
ruth
when
your
mother
died
i
was
almost
insane
with
grief
i
ca
tell
you
about
that
time
i
was
young
and
i
was
gay
and
full
of
plans
and
aims
and
intentions
in
all
of
which
she
had
been
involved
then
came
the
sudden
blank
and
it
almost
unsettled
my
reason
there
was
a
young
woman
boarding
at
the
same
house
where
i
went
who
was
kind
to
me
who
befriended
me
in
various
ways
and
tried
to
help
me
to
endure
my
sorrow
she
grew
to
be
almost
necessary
to
my
endurance
of
myself
after
a
little
i
married
her
i
did
not
take
this
step
till
i
found
that
my
friendship
with
her
or
rather
hers
with
me
was
compromising
her
in
the
eyes
of
others
let
me
hurry
over
it
ruth
we
lived
together
but
a
few
weeks
then
i
was
obliged
to
go
abroad
away
from
old
scenes
and
associations
and
plunged
into
business
cares
i
gradually
recovered
my
usual
tone
of
mind
but
it
was
not
till
i
came
home
again
that
i
discovered
what
a
fatal
blunder
i
had
made
that
young
woman
had
not
a
single
idea
in
common
with
my
plans
and
aims
in
life
she
was
ignorant
uncultured
and
it
seemed
to
me
unendurable
how
i
ever
allowed
myself
to
be
such
a
fool
i
do
not
know
but
up
to
this
time
i
had
at
least
not
been
a
villain
i
did
desert
her
ruth
i
made
a
deliberate
compromise
with
her
she
was
to
take
her
child
and
go
away
hundreds
of
miles
away
where
i
would
not
be
likely
ever
to
come
in
contact
with
her
again
and
i
was
to
take
your
mother
child
and
go
where
i
pleased
of
course
i
was
to
support
her
and
i
have
done
so
ever
since
that
was
eighteen
years
ago
she
is
still
living
and
the
daughter
is
living
i
have
always
been
careful
to
keep
them
supplied
with
money
i
have
tried
to
have
done
for
the
girl
what
money
could
do
but
i
have
never
seen
their
faces
since
that
time
now
ruth
you
know
the
miserable
story
there
are
a
hundred
details
that
i
could
give
you
that
perhaps
would
lead
you
to
have
more
pity
for
your
father
if
it
did
not
lead
you
to
despise
him
more
for
his
weakness
it
is
hard
to
be
despised
by
child
i
tell
you
truly
ruth
that
the
bitterest
of
this
bitterness
is
the
thought
of
you
the
proud
man
lip
quivered
and
his
voice
trembled
just
here
poor
ruth
erskine
i
am
willing
to
do
she
had
said
to
marion
not
two
hours
before
and
here
was
a
thing
the
possibility
of
which
she
had
never
dreamed
staring
her
in
the
face
waiting
to
be
done
and
she
felt
that
she
could
not
do
it
oh
why
was
it
necessary
why
not
let
everything
be
as
it
has
been
said
that
wily
villain
satan
whispering
in
her
ears
they
were
false
vows
they
are
better
broken
than
kept
he
does
not
love
her
though
he
said
he
did
and
how
can
we
ever
endure
it
the
shame
the
disgrace
the
horrid
explanations
our
name
the
name
on
everybody
lips
common
loafers
sneering
at
us
and
then
to
have
the
family
changed
myself
to
be
only
a
back
figure
a
mother
who
is
not
and
never
my
mother
taking
my
place
and
the
other
one
oh
it
can
not
be
possible
that
we
must
endure
this
there
must
be
some
other
way
they
are
doubtless
contented
why
could
it
not
remain
as
it
is
as
if
to
answer
her
unspoken
thoughts
judge
erskine
suddenly
said
i
have
canvassed
the
entire
subject
in
all
its
bearings
you
may
be
sure
of
that
i
am
living
a
lie
i
am
saying
my
wife
is
dead
when
a
woman
to
whom
before
god
i
gave
that
name
is
living
i
am
saying
that
i
have
but
one
child
when
there
is
another
to
whom
i
am
as
certainly
father
as
i
am
to
you
i
am
leaving
them
nay
obliging
them
to
live
a
daily
lie
i
have
assured
myself
to
a
certainty
that
one
sin
can
never
be
atoned
for
by
another
sin
there
is
but
one
atonement
and
the
source
of
all
help
says
we
our
sins
he
is
faithful
and
just
to
forgive
us
our
sins
and
to
cleanse
us
from
unrighteousness
i
know
there
is
only
one
way
of
cleansing
daughter
get
thee
behind
me
satan
the
only
perfect
life
gave
that
sentence
once
not
alone
for
himself
thank
god
he
has
many
a
time
since
enabled
his
weak
children
of
the
flesh
to
repeat
it
in
triumph
the
grace
came
then
and
there
to
ruth
erskine
she
rose
up
from
her
chair
and
going
over
to
her
father
did
what
she
had
never
remembered
doing
in
her
life
before
she
bent
down
and
wound
both
arms
around
his
neck
and
kissed
him
her
voice
was
low
and
steady
father
do
let
this
or
anything
earthly
stand
between
you
and
christ
you
are
not
a
sinner
above
all
others
it
is
only
the
interposing
hand
of
god
that
has
kept
me
from
taking
sinful
vows
upon
my
lips
let
us
do
just
what
is
right
send
for
them
to
come
home
and
i
will
try
to
be
a
daughter
and
a
sister
and
i
will
stand
by
you
and
help
you
in
every
possible
way
there
are
harder
trials
than
ours
will
be
after
all
it
was
his
daughter
who
finally
and
utterly
broke
the
proud
haughty
heart
judge
erskine
bowed
himself
before
her
and
sobbed
like
a
child
in
the
bitterness
and
the
humiliation
of
his
soul
god
bless
you
he
said
at
last
in
broken
utterance
there
is
an
almighty
saviour
i
need
nothing
more
than
your
words
to
convince
me
of
the
truth
of
that
if
love
to
him
can
lead
your
heart
to
such
forgiveness
as
this
what
must
his
forgiveness
be
ruth
you
have
saved
my
soul
i
will
give
up
the
struggle
i
have
tried
to
fight
it
out
i
have
tried
to
say
that
i
could
not
for
my
own
sake
and
for
my
own
name
it
seemed
impossible
then
when
i
got
beyond
that
and
felt
that
for
myself
if
i
could
have
rest
in
the
love
of
christ
and
could
feel
that
he
forgave
me
i
cared
for
nothing
else
then
i
said
can
not
do
this
for
my
child
sake
i
can
never
plunge
her
into
this
depth
of
sin
and
shame
then
my
daughter
there
came
to
me
a
message
from
god
and
of
all
those
that
come
to
a
miserable
man
like
me
it
was
this
that
loveth
son
or
daughter
more
than
me
is
not
worthy
of
me
then
i
saw
that
i
must
be
willing
even
to
lose
your
love
to
make
you
despise
me
and
that
was
the
bitterest
cup
of
all
but
thank
god
he
has
spared
me
this
god
bless
you
my
daughter
there
was
something
almost
terrible
to
ruth
in
seeing
her
cold
calm
father
so
moved
she
had
never
realized
what
awfully
solemn
things
were
till
she
saw
them
on
her
father
cheeks
and
felt
them
falling
hot
on
her
head
from
eyes
so
unused
to
weeping
the
kisses
she
gave
him
were
very
soft
and
clinging
full
of
tender
soothing
touches
then
father
and
daughter
knelt
together
and
the
long
long
struggle
with
sin
and
pride
and
was
concluded
do
you
think
this
was
a
lasting
victory
for
ruth
erskine
you
do
not
understand
the
power
of
that
old
serpent
the
devil
if
you
can
not
think
how
he
came
to
her
again
and
again
in
the
silence
of
her
own
room
even
into
the
midst
of
her
rejoicings
over
the
soul
even
while
the
joy
in
heaven
among
the
angels
was
still
ringing
out
over
her
father
came
whispering
to
her
heart
to
say
oh
i
ca
i
ca
think
of
it
the
erskines
how
we
endure
it
is
it
that
we
must
perhaps
the
woman
would
rather
live
as
she
is
as
if
had
anything
to
do
with
the
question
of
right
and
wrong
the
very
next
instant
ruth
curled
her
lip
sneeringly
over
her
own
folly
she
never
forgot
that
night
nor
how
the
conflict
waged
she
tried
to
imagine
herself
saying
mother
to
one
who
really
had
a
nominal
right
to
the
title
not
that
it
was
an
unfamiliar
word
to
her
the
old
aunt
who
had
occupied
the
mother
place
in
the
household
since
ruth
was
a
wee
creature
of
two
years
she
had
learned
almost
from
the
instincts
of
childhood
to
call
mamma
and
as
she
grew
older
and
was
unused
to
any
other
name
for
wheeler
the
widowed
aunt
she
toned
it
into
the
familiar
and
comfortable
word
mother
and
had
always
spoken
to
and
of
her
in
that
name
yet
she
knew
very
well
how
little
the
title
meant
to
her
she
had
loved
this
old
lady
with
a
sort
of
pitying
patronizing
love
realizing
even
very
early
in
her
life
that
she
herself
had
more
more
executive
ability
in
her
little
finger
than
was
spread
all
over
the
placid
lady
who
early
learned
that
ruthie
was
to
do
precisely
as
she
pleased
such
a
cipher
was
this
same
old
lady
in
the
household
that
when
a
long
lost
son
appeared
on
the
surface
during
ruth
absence
at
chautauqua
proving
sturdy
old
californian
as
he
was
to
have
a
home
and
place
for
his
mother
and
a
heart
to
take
her
with
him
her
departure
caused
scarcely
a
ripple
in
the
household
of
the
erskines
she
had
been
its
nominal
head
for
eighteen
years
but
the
real
head
who
was
absent
at
chautauqua
had
three
or
four
perfectly
trained
servants
who
knew
their
young
mistress
will
so
well
that
they
could
execute
it
in
her
absence
as
well
as
when
she
was
present
so
when
ruth
took
in
the
eyes
of
everybody
the
position
that
had
really
been
hers
so
long
it
made
no
sort
of
change
in
her
plans
or
ways
and
beyond
a
certain
lingering
tenderness
when
she
spoke
of
her
by
that
familiar
title
mother
there
was
no
indication
that
the
woman
who
had
had
so
constant
and
intimate
connection
with
her
life
was
remembered
but
this
name
applied
to
another
and
that
other
one
whom
she
had
never
seen
in
her
life
and
who
yet
was
actually
to
occupy
the
position
of
head
of
the
household
her
father
wife
in
the
eyes
of
society
her
mother
spoken
of
as
such
herself
asked
how
is
your
mother
or
what
does
your
mother
think
of
this
would
anyone
dare
to
use
that
name
to
her
no
one
had
so
spoken
of
her
aunt
they
all
knew
she
was
only
her
aunt
though
she
chose
to
pet
her
by
the
use
of
that
tender
name
could
she
bear
all
these
things
and
a
hundred
others
that
would
come
up
marion
she
said
the
next
day
as
she
chanced
to
meet
that
young
lady
on
the
street
i
have
something
to
tell
you
i
want
to
call
on
you
to
witness
that
i
shall
never
again
be
guilty
of
that
vainglorious
absurdity
of
saying
that
i
am
ready
for
anything
one
can
never
know
whether
this
is
true
or
not
at
least
i
am
sure
i
never
can
what
i
am
to
say
in
the
future
is
simply
make
me
willing
to
do
what
there
is
for
me
to
do
this
day
remember
that
in
a
few
days
you
will
understand
what
i
mean
then
she
went
on
marion
pondered
over
it
she
did
not
understand
it
at
all
what
trial
could
have
come
to
ruth
that
had
brought
her
the
knowledge
of
the
weakness
of
her
own
heart
she
wondered
if
it
had
also
brought
her
peace

some
time
to
the
dismalness
of
a
reaction
the
most
forlorn
little
victim
that
could
be
imagined
was
flossy
shipley
on
that
evening
after
the
meetings
on
which
her
soul
had
fed
so
long
were
closed
everything
in
nature
and
in
circumstances
conspired
to
sink
her
into
her
desolate
mood
in
the
first
place
it
was
raining
now
a
rain
closing
in
upon
a
warm
and
dusty
summer
day
is
a
positive
delight
one
can
listen
to
the
pattering
drops
with
a
sense
of
eager
satisfaction
but
a
rain
in
midwinter
after
a
day
of
sunless
mist
and
fog
almost
amounting
to
rain
when
the
streets
are
that
mixture
of
snow
and
water
that
can
be
known
only
as
slush
when
every
opening
of
a
door
sends
in
gusts
of
damp
air
that
chill
to
one
very
bones
this
weather
is
a
trial
at
least
it
seemed
such
to
poor
little
flossy
she
shivered
over
the
fire
in
the
coal
grate
it
glowed
brightly
and
the
room
was
warm
and
bright
yet
to
flossy
there
was
a
sense
of
chill
in
everything
she
was
all
alone
and
the
circumstances
connected
with
that
loneliness
were
not
calculated
to
brighten
the
evening
for
her
the
entire
family
had
gone
out
to
a
party
not
one
of
those
quiet
little
entertainments
which
people
had
been
so
careful
to
explain
and
apologize
for
during
the
meetings
but
a
grand
display
of
toilet
and
supper
and
expenditure
of
all
kinds
westervelt
the
hostess
being
at
all
times
noted
for
the
display
of
her
entertainments
had
lavished
more
than
the
usual
amount
of
time
and
money
on
the
present
ones
and
waited
for
the
meetings
to
close
with
the
most
exemplary
patience
in
order
that
she
might
gain
a
very
few
among
her
guests
from
those
who
felt
the
impropriety
of
mixing
things
too
much
to
be
sure
the
society
in
general
which
was
admitted
to
westervelt
parlors
was
not
from
that
class
who
had
any
scruples
as
to
what
time
they
attended
parties
but
there
were
two
or
three
notable
exceptions
and
those
the
lady
had
been
anxious
to
claim
prominent
among
them
had
been
the
erskines
it
never
seeming
to
occur
to
westervelt
brains
that
there
could
be
other
excuse
found
for
not
accepting
her
invitation
save
the
meetings
that
ruth
had
taken
to
attending
in
such
a
frantic
manner
let
me
say
in
passing
that
neither
ruth
erskine
nor
her
father
honored
the
invitation
they
had
other
matters
to
attend
to
meantime
flossy
shipley
had
utterly
disgusted
her
mother
and
almost
offended
her
father
by
giving
a
peremptory
and
persistent
refusal
such
a
storm
of
talk
as
there
had
been
over
this
matter
almost
exhausted
the
strength
of
poor
little
flossy
who
did
not
like
argument
and
who
yet
could
persist
in
a
most
unaccountable
firm
manner
when
occasion
required
such
an
absurd
idea
her
sister
kitty
said
flashing
contemptuous
eyes
on
her
i
wonder
what
you
think
is
going
to
become
of
you
flossy
do
you
mean
to
mope
at
home
all
the
rest
of
the
winter
i
assure
you
that
westervelt
is
not
the
only
one
who
intends
to
give
a
party
we
are
going
to
have
an
unusually
gay
season
to
revive
us
after
so
much
do
you
mean
to
appear
anywhere
you
might
as
well
retire
into
a
convent
at
once
if
that
is
the
case
people
will
be
saying
of
me
as
they
do
of
treslam
soon
that
i
do
not
allow
you
to
appear
in
society
while
kitty
is
still
a
young
lady
this
shipley
said
and
her
tone
if
not
as
sharp
as
kitty
had
a
note
of
grievance
in
it
that
was
hard
to
bear
then
charlie
had
taken
up
the
theme
what
is
the
use
in
turning
mope
sis
i
sure
you
can
be
as
good
as
you
like
and
go
to
a
party
occasionally
i
do
mean
to
mope
charlie
flossy
said
trying
to
speak
cheerfully
but
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
and
a
tremulous
sound
in
her
voice
i
am
truly
happier
at
home
than
i
am
at
those
places
i
do
like
to
go
it
is
not
entirely
because
i
feel
i
ought
not
it
is
because
i
do
want
to
she
has
risen
above
such
follies
kitty
said
and
it
is
impossible
to
tell
you
what
a
disagreeable
inflection
there
was
to
her
voice
mother
i
am
sorry
that
the
poor
child
has
to
associate
with
such
volatile
creatures
as
you
and
i
she
ought
to
have
some
kindred
spirit
i
am
sure
i
do
know
where
she
will
find
any
shipley
said
with
a
sigh
outside
of
that
trio
of
girls
who
among
them
have
contrived
to
make
a
perfect
little
slave
of
you
i
am
sure
i
do
know
who
has
any
influence
over
you
i
used
to
think
you
regarded
your
mother
wishes
a
trifle
but
i
find
i
am
mistaken
oh
mother
flossy
said
and
this
time
the
tears
began
to
fall
why
you
talk
so
i
am
sure
i
try
to
please
you
in
every
way
that
i
can
i
did
not
know
that
you
cared
to
have
me
go
to
parties
unless
i
wanted
to
go
either
the
tears
or
something
else
made
her
brother
indignant
what
a
scene
about
nothing
he
said
irritably
why
ca
you
let
flossy
go
to
parties
or
not
as
she
pleases
parties
are
not
such
delightful
institutions
that
she
need
be
expected
to
be
in
love
with
them
i
should
be
delighted
if
i
never
had
to
appear
at
another
why
not
let
people
have
their
fun
in
this
world
where
they
choose
to
find
it
if
flossy
has
lately
discovered
that
hers
can
only
be
found
in
i
am
sure
it
is
a
harmless
enough
diversion
while
the
fit
lasts
shipley
laughed
her
son
could
nearly
always
put
her
into
good
humor
besides
she
did
like
to
see
tears
on
her
baby
face
that
was
her
pet
name
for
flossy
oh
i
do
know
that
it
makes
any
serious
difference
she
said
not
enough
to
spoil
your
eyes
over
flossy
i
do
want
you
to
go
out
with
us
unless
you
want
to
only
it
is
rather
embarrassing
to
be
constantly
arranging
regrets
for
you
besides
i
do
see
what
it
is
all
coming
to
you
will
be
a
moping
forsaken
creature
old
before
your
time
if
this
continues
as
for
shipley
he
maintained
a
haughty
silence
neither
expressing
an
opinion
on
that
subject
nor
on
any
other
which
would
involve
him
in
a
conversation
with
flossy
she
knew
that
he
was
more
seriously
displeased
with
her
than
were
any
of
the
others
not
so
much
about
the
parties
as
about
other
and
graver
matters
baker
was
the
son
of
shipley
old
friend
for
this
reason
and
for
several
others
shipley
was
very
fond
of
him
it
had
long
been
in
accordance
with
his
plans
that
flossy
should
become
at
some
future
time
baker
and
that
the
estates
of
the
two
families
should
be
thus
united
while
he
was
not
at
all
the
sort
of
man
who
would
have
interfered
to
push
such
an
arrangement
against
the
preferences
of
the
parties
concerned
he
had
looked
on
with
great
and
increasing
satisfaction
while
the
plans
of
the
young
people
evidently
tended
strongly
in
that
direction
that
his
daughter
after
an
absence
from
home
of
only
two
weeks
should
have
come
in
contact
with
that
which
seemed
to
change
all
her
tastes
and
views
and
plans
in
regard
to
other
matters
but
which
had
actually
caused
her
to
turn
with
a
steady
and
increasing
determination
away
from
the
friend
who
had
been
her
acknowledged
protector
and
attendant
ever
since
she
was
a
child
was
a
matter
that
he
did
not
understand
nor
approve
i
am
not
a
tyrant
he
would
say
sullenly
when
shipley
and
himself
talked
the
matter
over
when
she
with
the
characteristics
of
a
mother
even
while
her
child
annoyed
and
vexed
her
yet
struggled
to
speak
a
word
for
her
when
a
third
person
came
in
to
blame
i
never
ordered
flossy
to
be
so
exceedingly
intimate
with
baker
that
their
names
have
been
coupled
together
ever
since
she
was
a
baby
i
never
insisted
on
her
accepting
his
attentions
on
all
occasions
it
was
her
own
free
will
i
own
that
i
was
pleased
with
the
inclination
she
displayed
and
did
what
i
could
to
make
the
way
pleasant
for
her
but
the
thing
is
not
of
my
planning
what
i
am
displeased
with
is
this
sudden
change
there
is
no
reason
for
it
and
no
sense
in
it
it
is
just
a
mere
baby
performance
a
girlish
freak
very
unpleasant
for
him
and
very
disagreeable
for
us
the
child
ought
not
to
be
upheld
in
it
so
they
did
their
best
not
to
uphold
her
and
succeeded
among
them
in
making
her
life
very
disagreeable
to
her
the
matter
had
culminated
on
the
evening
before
the
party
in
question
baker
despite
the
persistent
and
patient
efforts
on
flossy
part
to
show
him
the
folly
of
his
course
had
insisted
on
obliging
her
to
speak
a
decided
negative
to
his
earnestly
pressed
question
the
result
was
an
unusually
unpleasant
domestic
scene
and
a
general
air
of
gloom
and
unhappiness
shipley
had
not
ordered
his
daughter
to
marry
baker
he
would
have
been
shocked
beyond
measure
at
such
a
proceeding
on
the
part
of
a
father
but
he
made
her
so
unhappy
with
a
sense
of
his
disappointment
and
disapproval
that
more
than
once
she
sighed
wearily
and
wished
in
her
sad
little
heart
that
all
this
living
was
over
finally
they
all
went
off
to
westervelt
party
and
left
her
alone
she
had
never
felt
so
much
alone
in
her
life
the
blessed
meetings
which
had
been
such
a
wealth
of
delight
and
helpfulness
to
her
heart
were
closed
the
sweet
and
holy
and
elevating
influences
that
had
surrounded
her
outer
life
for
so
long
were
withdrawn
she
missed
them
bitterly
it
almost
seemed
to
her
as
if
everything
were
withdrawn
from
her
father
and
mother
sister
and
even
her
brother
were
all
more
or
less
annoyed
at
her
course
charlie
had
been
betrayed
into
more
positive
sharpness
than
this
favorite
sister
had
ever
felt
from
him
before
he
felt
that
his
friend
baker
had
been
there
was
a
very
sore
spot
about
this
matter
for
flossy
the
truth
was
she
could
not
help
seeing
that
in
a
sense
her
father
was
right
she
had
brought
it
on
herself
not
lately
not
since
her
utter
change
of
views
and
aims
but
long
before
that
with
what
satisfaction
had
she
allowed
her
name
to
be
coupled
familiarly
with
that
of
baker
how
much
she
had
enjoyed
his
exclusive
attentions
not
that
she
really
and
heartily
liked
him
with
a
liking
that
made
her
willing
to
think
of
him
as
belonging
to
her
forever
she
had
chosen
rather
not
to
allow
herself
to
think
of
any
such
time
she
had
contented
herself
with
saying
that
she
was
too
young
to
think
of
such
things
that
she
was
not
obliged
to
settle
that
question
till
the
time
came
but
mind
you
all
the
time
she
chose
to
allow
and
enjoy
and
encourage
by
her
smiles
and
her
evident
pleasure
in
them
very
special
attentions
that
gave
other
people
liberty
to
speak
of
them
almost
as
one
to
call
it
by
a
very
plain
name
which
flossy
hated
and
which
made
her
cheek
glow
as
she
forced
herself
to
say
it
of
herself
she
had
been
flirting
with
baker
it
is
a
nice
word
i
do
wonder
that
she
hated
it
yet
so
long
as
young
ladies
continue
to
be
guilty
of
the
sort
of
conduct
that
can
only
be
described
by
that
unpleasant
and
coarse
sounding
word
i
am
afraid
it
will
be
used
all
that
was
over
now
at
least
it
was
over
as
much
as
flossy
could
make
it
but
there
remained
an
uncomfortable
sense
that
she
had
wronged
a
man
who
honestly
loved
her
not
intentionally
no
decent
woman
does
that
but
thoughtlessly
so
many
silly
girls
do
that
she
had
lost
her
influence
over
him
now
rather
she
had
been
obliged
to
put
herself
in
a
position
to
lose
all
influence
she
might
have
been
his
true
faithful
friend
now
and
helped
him
up
to
a
higher
manhood
only
by
her
former
folly
she
had
put
it
out
of
her
power
these
were
not
pleasant
reflections
then
there
was
no
denying
that
she
felt
very
desolate
a
forlorn
friendless
creature
her
mother
had
said
she
would
become
or
words
to
that
effect
the
thought
lingered
with
her
she
looked
over
her
list
of
friends
there
was
always
those
three
girls
growing
dearer
by
every
day
of
association
yet
their
lives
necessarily
ran
much
apart
it
would
naturally
grow
more
and
more
so
as
the
future
came
to
them
then
too
she
was
equally
intimate
with
each
of
them
they
were
all
equally
dear
to
her
now
a
woman
can
not
have
three
friends
who
shall
all
fill
that
one
place
in
her
heart
which
she
finds
she
thought
of
her
home
ties
strong
they
certainly
were
growing
stronger
every
day
there
were
few
things
that
she
did
not
feel
willing
to
do
for
her
father
but
the
one
thing
that
he
wanted
just
now
was
that
she
should
marry
baker
she
could
not
do
that
even
to
please
him
he
would
recover
from
that
state
of
feeling
of
course
but
would
not
other
kindred
states
of
feeling
constantly
arise
both
with
him
and
with
her
mother
could
she
not
foresee
a
constant
difference
of
opinion
on
almost
every
imaginable
topic
then
there
was
her
sister
kitty
could
any
two
lives
run
more
widely
apart
than
hers
and
kitty
were
likely
to
had
they
a
single
taste
in
common
as
for
charlie
flossy
turned
from
that
subject
it
was
too
sore
and
too
tender
a
spot
to
be
probed
she
trembled
for
charlie
he
was
walking
in
slippery
places
the
descent
was
growing
easier
she
felt
that
rather
than
saw
it
and
she
felt
too
that
his
friend
baker
was
the
leader
and
she
felt
too
that
her
intimacy
with
baker
had
greatly
strengthened
his
no
wonder
that
the
spot
was
a
sore
one
grouping
all
these
things
together
and
brooding
over
them
with
no
sound
breaking
the
silence
save
the
ceaseless
drip
drip
of
the
rain
and
the
whirls
of
defiant
wind
sitting
there
in
her
loneliness
the
large
in
which
she
crouched
being
drawn
up
before
that
glowing
fire
is
it
any
wonder
that
the
firelight
revealed
the
fact
that
great
silent
tears
were
slowly
following
each
other
down
flossy
round
smooth
cheek
she
felt
like
a
pitiful
lonely
forsaken
baby
it
was
not
that
she
was
utterly
miserable
she
recognized
even
then
the
thought
that
she
had
an
almighty
everlasting
unchanging
friend
she
rejoiced
even
then
at
the
thought
not
as
she
might
have
rejoiced
not
as
it
was
her
privilege
to
do
but
i
mean
she
knew
that
all
these
trials
and
mistakes
and
burdens
were
but
for
a
moment
she
knew
that
when
the
sun
shone
again
she
would
be
able
to
come
out
from
behind
these
clouds
and
grasp
some
of
the
brightness
of
her
life
and
endure
with
patience
the
little
annoyances
that
were
to
be
borne
remembering
that
she
was
still
very
young
and
that
there
was
a
chance
for
a
great
deal
of
brightness
for
her
even
on
this
side
but
in
the
meantime
her
intensely
human
heart
craved
human
companionship
and
sympathy
craved
it
to
such
a
degree
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
rain
and
the
darkness
and
the
growing
lateness
of
the
hour
she
would
have
gone
out
then
after
one
of
those
three
girls
to
share
her
mood
with
her
into
the
midst
of
this
state
of
dismal
journeying
into
the
valley
of
gloom
there
pealed
the
sound
of
the
bell
it
did
not
startle
her
the
callers
in
their
circle
would
be
sure
to
be
engaged
at
the
party
and
to
suppose
that
she
was
besides
it
was
hardly
an
evening
for
ordinary
callers
something
as
important
as
a
party
was
would
be
expected
to
call
out
people
it
was
some
one
with
a
business
message
for
father
she
presumed
and
she
did
not
arouse
from
her
position
among
the
cushions
of
that
great
chair
half
listening
half
giving
attention
to
her
own
thoughts
she
was
conscious
that
a
servant
came
to
answer
the
bell
that
the
front
door
opened
and
shut
that
there
was
a
question
asked
and
answered
in
the
hall
then
she
gave
over
attending
to
the
matter
if
she
were
needed
the
girl
knew
she
was
in
the
library
yes
she
was
to
be
summoned
for
something
to
receive
the
message
probably
for
the
library
door
quietly
unclosed
what
is
it
katie
she
asked
in
a
sort
of
muffled
undertone
to
hide
the
traces
of
disturbance
in
her
voice
and
not
turning
her
head
in
that
direction
she
knew
there
were
tears
on
her
cheeks
suppose
it
should
not
be
katie
may
any
one
else
come
in
and
tell
you
what
it
is
this
was
the
sentence
wherewith
she
was
answered
what
a
sudden
springing
up
there
was
from
that
chair
even
the
tears
were
forgotten
and
what
a
singular
ring
there
was
to
flossy
voice
as
she
whirled
round
to
full
view
of
the
intruder
and
said
oh
mr
roberts
now
dear
friends
of
this
little
lonely
flossy
are
you
so
stupid
that
you
need
to
be
told
that
in
less
than
half
an
hour
from
that
moment
she
believed
that
there
could
never
again
come
to
her
an
absolutely
lonely
hour
that
whatever
might
come
between
them
whether
of
life
or
of
death
there
would
be
that
for
each
to
remember
that
would
make
it
impossible
ever
to
be
desolate
again
for
there
is
no
desolation
of
heart
to
those
who
part
at
night
to
meet
again
in
the
morning
there
may
be
loneliness
and
a
reaching
out
after
and
sometimes
an
unutterable
longing
for
the
morning
but
to
those
who
are
sure
beyond
the
possibility
of
a
doubt
that
the
eternal
morning
dawn
and
dawn
for
them
there
is
never
again
a
desolation

the
added
name
that
same
evening
was
fraught
with
memorable
associations
to
others
beside
flossy
shipley
it
began
in
gloom
and
unusual
depression
even
to
marion
the
day
had
been
a
hard
one
in
school
those
of
the
scholars
who
had
been
constant
attendants
at
the
meetings
felt
the
inevitable
sense
of
loneliness
and
loss
that
must
follow
the
close
of
such
unusual
means
of
help
i
have
actually
heard
some
christian
people
advance
this
fact
that
there
was
a
reaction
of
loneliness
after
such
meetings
closed
as
a
good
reason
why
they
were
unwise
efforts
demoralizing
in
their
results
it
is
a
curious
fact
that
such
reasoners
are
never
found
to
advocate
the
entire
separation
of
family
friends
on
the
plea
that
a
reunion
followed
by
a
separation
is
demoralizing
in
its
results
because
it
leaves
an
added
sense
of
loneliness
it
is
perhaps
to
be
questioned
whether
loneliness
is
after
all
demoralizing
in
its
effects
be
that
as
it
may
many
of
the
scholars
felt
it
then
there
were
some
among
their
number
who
had
persistently
shunned
the
meetings
and
their
influences
who
now
that
the
opportunity
was
passed
felt
those
stings
of
conscience
that
are
sure
to
follow
enlightened
minds
who
have
persisted
in
going
a
wrong
road
also
there
were
those
who
had
been
almost
persuaded
and
who
yet
so
far
as
their
salvation
was
concerned
were
no
nearer
it
that
day
than
though
they
had
never
thought
of
the
matter
for
never
saves
a
soul
all
these
influences
combined
served
to
make
depression
the
predominant
feeling
marion
struggled
with
it
and
tried
to
be
cheerful
before
her
pupils
but
sank
into
gravity
and
unusual
sadness
at
every
interval
between
the
busy
hours
of
the
day
late
in
the
afternoon
she
had
a
conversation
with
one
of
the
girls
which
did
not
serve
to
encourage
her
heart
it
was
the
drawing
hour
large
numbers
of
the
young
ladies
in
her
room
had
gone
to
the
studio
with
the
drawing
master
those
few
who
remained
were
engaged
in
copying
their
exercises
for
the
next
morning
class
marion
was
at
leisure
her
only
duty
being
to
render
assistance
in
the
matter
of
copying
wherever
a
raised
hand
indicated
that
help
was
needed
answering
one
of
these
calls
she
found
herself
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
large
room
quite
near
to
grace
dennis
desk
and
in
passing
she
noticed
that
gracie
while
her
book
was
before
her
and
her
pen
in
hand
was
not
writing
at
all
but
that
her
left
hand
was
shading
a
face
that
looked
sad
and
pale
and
covering
eyes
that
might
have
tears
in
them
after
fulfilling
her
duty
to
the
needy
scholar
she
turned
back
to
grace
what
is
it
she
said
softly
taking
the
vacant
seat
by
grace
side
and
touching
tenderly
the
crown
of
hair
that
covered
the
drooping
head
grace
looked
up
quickly
with
a
gleam
of
sunshine
through
which
shone
a
tear
it
is
a
fit
of
the
blues
i
am
almost
afraid
i
am
very
much
ashamed
of
myself
i
do
feel
so
very
often
miss
wilbur
i
think
the
feeling
must
be
what
the
girls
call
blues
i
am
not
sure
do
you
feel
in
any
degree
sure
what
has
caused
such
a
remarkable
disease
to
attack
you
marion
asked
in
a
low
tender
yet
cheery
and
a
tone
the
words
made
gracie
laugh
but
the
tenderness
in
the
tone
seemed
to
start
another
tear
you
will
be
amused
at
me
miss
wilbur
or
ashamed
of
me
i
do
know
which
i
am
ashamed
of
myself
but
i
do
feel
so
forlorn
and
lonely
lonely
marion
echoed
with
a
little
start
she
realized
that
she
herself
knew
in
its
fulness
what
that
feeling
was
but
for
gracie
dennis
treasured
as
she
was
in
an
atmosphere
of
fatherly
love
it
was
hard
to
understand
it
if
i
had
my
dear
father
i
do
think
i
should
feel
lonely
she
said
gently
i
know
grace
answered
he
is
the
dearest
father
a
girl
ever
had
but
there
is
only
a
little
bit
of
him
mine
miss
wilbur
i
do
mean
that
either
i
am
not
selfish
i
know
he
loves
me
with
all
his
heart
but
i
mean
his
time
is
so
very
much
occupied
that
he
can
only
give
me
very
little
bits
now
and
then
it
has
to
be
so
it
is
not
his
fault
i
would
not
have
him
any
different
even
in
this
but
then
if
i
had
a
sister
do
you
see
how
different
it
would
be
or
even
a
brother
or
and
here
gracie
head
dropped
low
and
her
voice
quivered
miss
wilbur
if
i
had
a
mother
one
who
loved
me
and
would
sympathize
with
me
and
help
me
i
think
i
would
be
the
happiest
girl
in
all
the
world
there
was
every
appearance
that
with
a
few
more
words
of
tender
sympathy
this
young
girl
would
lose
all
her
and
be
that
which
she
so
much
shrank
from
an
object
of
general
wonderment
and
conversation
marion
felt
that
she
must
bestow
her
sympathy
sparingly
i
dare
say
you
would
give
yourself
over
to
a
hearty
struggle
not
to
hate
her
outright
she
said
in
a
quiet
tone
the
sobs
which
were
shaking
the
young
girl
beside
her
were
suddenly
checked
presently
gracie
looked
up
a
gleam
half
of
mirth
half
of
defiance
in
her
handsome
eyes
i
mean
a
mother
she
said
have
you
one
does
she
love
her
darling
and
watch
over
and
wait
for
her
coming
the
voice
had
taken
on
its
tenderness
again
then
after
a
moment
marion
added
it
is
hard
to
realize
i
know
but
i
believe
it
and
i
look
toward
that
thought
with
all
my
soul
you
remember
gracie
that
i
have
nothing
but
that
to
feed
on
no
earthly
friend
to
help
me
realize
it
grace
stole
a
soft
hand
into
her
teacher
i
wish
you
would
love
me
very
much
she
said
brightly
i
wish
you
would
let
me
love
you
do
you
know
you
help
me
every
time
you
speak
to
me
and
you
do
it
in
such
strange
ways
not
at
all
in
the
direction
that
i
am
looking
for
help
i
do
thank
you
so
much
then
suppose
you
prove
it
to
me
by
showing
what
an
immaculate
copy
of
your
exercise
you
can
hand
in
do
you
know
it
is
by
just
such
matters
as
that
that
people
are
permitted
to
show
their
love
and
gratitude
and
all
those
delightful
things
that
is
what
glorifies
work
another
clinging
pressure
of
hands
and
teacher
and
pupil
went
about
their
duties
but
though
marion
had
helped
gracie
she
had
not
helped
herself
except
that
in
a
tired
sort
of
way
she
realized
that
it
was
a
great
pleasure
to
be
able
to
help
anybody
most
of
all
this
favorite
pupil
still
the
dreariness
did
not
lessen
it
went
home
with
her
to
her
dingy
followed
her
to
the
gloomy
and
the
uninviting
the
most
that
was
the
trouble
with
marion
wilbur
was
that
she
was
tired
in
body
and
brain
if
people
only
realized
it
a
great
many
mental
troubles
and
trials
result
from
overworked
bodies
and
nerves
still
it
must
be
confessed
that
there
were
few
if
any
outside
influences
that
were
calculated
to
cheer
marion
wilbur
life
you
are
to
remember
how
very
much
alone
she
was
there
were
no
letters
to
be
watched
for
in
the
daily
mails
no
hopeful
looking
forward
if
one
failed
to
come
no
cheery
saying
to
one
heart
never
mind
it
will
surely
come
this
state
is
infinitely
better
than
the
hopeless
glance
one
bestows
upon
the
postman
realizing
he
is
nothing
to
them
no
friends
father
and
mother
gone
so
long
ago
that
of
one
there
was
no
recollection
at
all
of
the
other
tender
childhood
memories
sweet
and
lasting
and
incomparably
precious
but
only
memories
no
sister
no
brother
no
cousins
that
had
taken
the
place
to
her
of
sisters
only
that
old
uncle
and
aunt
who
were
such
staid
and
common
and
plodding
people
that
sometimes
the
very
thought
of
them
tired
this
girl
so
full
of
life
and
energy
girl
i
call
her
but
she
had
passed
the
days
of
her
girlhood
few
knew
it
it
was
wonderful
how
young
and
fresh
her
heart
had
kept
that
being
the
case
of
course
her
face
had
taken
the
same
impress
it
was
hard
for
ruth
erskine
to
realize
that
her
friend
marion
was
really
thirteen
years
older
than
herself
there
were
times
when
marion
herself
felt
younger
than
ruth
did
but
the
years
were
there
and
in
her
times
of
depression
marion
realized
it
so
many
of
them
recorded
and
yet
no
friends
to
whom
she
had
a
right
feeling
sure
that
nothing
in
human
experience
this
side
of
death
would
be
likely
to
come
in
and
take
her
away
from
them
the
very
at
that
was
sufficient
to
add
to
her
sense
of
desolation
it
is
a
pitiful
fact
that
we
are
such
dependent
creatures
that
even
the
crooked
laying
of
a
cloth
and
the
and
and
thereon
can
add
to
our
sense
of
friendlessness
then
what
is
there
particularly
consoling
or
cheering
in
a
cup
of
weak
tea
and
a
bit
of
bread
a
trifle
sour
spread
over
by
butter
more
than
a
trifle
strong
even
though
it
is
helped
down
by
some
very
dry
bits
of
chipped
beef
this
was
marion
supper
the
boarders
were
some
of
them
cross
some
of
them
simply
silent
and
hurried
all
of
them
damp
for
they
were
every
one
workers
out
in
the
damp
dreary
world
the
most
of
them
in
fact
i
may
say
all
of
them
were
very
tired
yet
many
of
them
had
work
to
do
that
very
evening
marion
ate
her
supper
in
silence
too
at
least
she
bit
at
her
bread
and
tried
to
swallow
her
simpering
tea
when
her
heart
was
bright
and
her
plans
for
the
evening
definite
and
satisfactory
she
could
manage
the
sour
bread
and
strong
butter
even
with
something
like
a
relish
but
there
was
no
use
in
trying
them
she
even
tormented
herself
with
the
planning
of
a
dainty
supper
accompanied
by
exquisite
table
arrangements
such
as
she
would
manage
for
a
sister
say
if
she
had
one
a
sister
who
had
been
in
school
all
day
and
was
wet
and
hungry
and
tired
if
she
had
the
room
and
the
table
and
the
china
and
the
materials
out
of
which
to
construct
the
supper
she
was
reasonable
enough
to
see
that
there
were
many
ifs
in
the
way
but
the
picture
did
not
make
the
present
supper
relish
she
struggled
to
rally
her
weary
powers
she
asked
the
clerk
next
her
if
it
had
been
a
busy
day
and
she
told
the
at
her
left
about
a
lovely
bouquet
of
flowers
that
one
of
the
girls
brought
to
school
and
that
she
had
meant
to
bring
home
to
her
if
it
was
presented
to
be
sure
it
was
not
but
the
intention
was
the
same
and
the
heart
of
the
was
cheered
finally
marion
gave
over
trying
to
swallow
the
supper
and
assuring
herself
with
the
determination
to
go
early
to
bed
and
so
escape
faintness
she
went
up
three
flights
of
stairs
to
her
room
when
i
am
rich
and
a
woman
of
leisure
i
will
build
a
house
that
shall
have
pleasant
rooms
and
good
bread
and
butter
and
i
will
board
and
and
clerks
for
a
song
this
she
said
aloud
then
she
set
about
making
a
bit
of
blaze
or
a
great
deal
of
smoke
in
the
little
imp
of
a
stove
the
stove
was
small
and
cracked
and
rusty
and
could
smoke
like
a
furnace
what
a
contrast
to
the
glowing
where
flossy
at
this
hour
toasted
her
pretty
cheeks
yet
marion
in
her
way
was
less
dismal
than
flossy
in
hers
it
was
not
in
marion
nature
to
shed
any
tears
instead
she
hummed
a
few
notes
of
a
glorious
old
tune
triumphant
in
every
note
trying
this
to
rob
herself
of
gloom
and
cheat
herself
into
the
belief
that
she
was
not
very
lonely
and
that
her
life
did
not
stretch
out
before
her
as
a
desolate
thing
she
did
not
mean
to
give
herself
up
to
glooming
though
she
did
hover
over
the
little
stove
and
lean
her
cheek
on
her
hand
and
look
at
nothing
in
particular
for
a
few
minutes
what
she
said
when
she
rallied
from
the
silence
was
simply
what
an
abominable
smoke
you
can
make
to
be
sure
marion
wilbur
when
you
try
hardly
any
one
can
compete
with
you
in
that
line
at
least
then
she
drew
her
school
reports
toward
her
intending
to
make
them
out
for
the
week
thus
far
but
she
scribbled
on
the
with
her
pencil
instead
she
wrote
her
own
name
marion
wilbur
a
pretty
enough
name
she
smiled
tenderly
over
the
initial
of
j
nobody
knew
what
that
was
for
suppose
the
girls
knew
that
it
stood
for
josiah
her
father
name
that
he
had
named
her
after
the
mother
was
buried
marion
that
after
the
mother
josiah
that
after
the
father
wilbur
the
dear
name
that
belonged
to
them
both
in
this
way
fancying
in
his
gentle
heart
that
he
linked
this
child
to
them
both
in
a
way
that
would
be
dear
to
her
to
remember
it
was
dear
she
loved
him
for
it
she
thoroughly
understood
the
feeling
but
hardly
any
one
else
would
so
she
thought
she
had
never
given
them
a
chance
to
smile
over
the
queer
name
her
father
had
given
she
could
smile
herself
but
she
wanted
no
one
else
to
do
so
then
she
wrote
grace
l
dennis
what
a
pretty
name
that
was
she
knew
what
the
l
was
for
lawrence
the
family
name
grace
mother
name
her
mother
too
had
died
when
she
was
a
wee
baby
gracie
remembered
her
though
and
by
that
memory
so
much
more
did
she
miss
her
marion
knew
how
that
was
by
her
remembrance
of
her
father
all
the
same
she
would
not
have
that
blotted
out
by
so
much
richer
was
gracie
than
herself
and
then
that
living
loving
father
marion
smiled
over
the
folly
of
grace
dennis
considering
her
life
a
lonely
one
yet
i
presume
she
feels
it
poor
darling
she
said
aloud
and
with
a
sigh
it
was
true
that
every
heart
knew
its
own
bitterness
then
she
said
i
really
must
go
to
work
at
these
reports
i
wonder
what
the
girls
are
doing
this
evening
eurie
is
nursing
her
mother
i
suppose
blessed
eurie
mother
and
father
both
within
the
fold
brought
there
by
eurie
faithful
life
mitchell
told
me
so
herself
what
a
sparkle
that
will
make
in
eurie
crown
i
wonder
what
ruth
meant
this
morning
poor
child
she
has
trouble
too
different
from
mine
why
as
to
that
i
really
have
any
ruth
ought
to
her
marcies
though
as
old
dinah
says
she
has
a
great
deal
that
i
have
yes
indeed
she
has
i
suppose
little
flossy
is
going
through
tribulation
over
that
tiresome
party
i
wonder
why
of
the
world
have
to
exist
by
tormenting
the
other
half
now
marion
wilbur
stop
scribbling
names
and
go
to
work
steady
scratching
from
the
old
steel
pen
a
few
minutes
then
a
knock
and
a
message
dennis
wanted
to
see
her
a
few
minutes
if
she
had
leisure
dr
dennis
she
said
rising
quickly
and
pushing
away
her
papers
oh
dear
me
where
is
that
of
mine
he
wants
those
names
i
dare
say
and
i
have
them
ready
i
might
have
been
copying
them
while
i
was
mooning
my
time
away
here
the
first
words
she
said
to
him
as
she
went
down
to
the
stuffy
parlor
were
i
have
them
ready
dennis
i
real
sorry
and
it
my
fault
too
i
had
time
to
copy
them
and
i
just
did
do
it
i
have
come
for
them
he
said
smiling
and
holding
out
his
hand
how
do
you
do
oh
quite
well
did
you
come
for
them
i
am
glad
for
i
felt
ashamed
dennis
do
you
see
how
well
one
woman
can
do
the
work
of
twenty
do
you
like
the
way
the
primary
class
is
managed
oh
by
the
way
you
want
that
book
do
you
i
meant
to
send
it
home
by
gracie
i
do
want
it
he
said
laughing
this
time
are
you
resolved
that
i
may
not
call
on
you
without
a
good
and
tangible
reason
if
that
be
the
case
i
certainly
have
one
i
want
you
to
sit
down
here
while
i
tell
you
all
about
it
i
not
in
the
mood
for
a
scolding
she
said
trying
to
speak
gayly
though
there
was
a
curious
little
tremble
to
her
voice
i
have
been
away
down
in
the
valley
of
gloom
i
believe
i
am
a
little
demoralized
dennis
i
think
i
need
a
every
evening
i
could
be
happier
then
i
know
a
christian
ought
to
be
able
to
have
one
he
said
quickly
two
souls
ought
to
be
able
to
come
together
in
communion
with
the
master
every
evening
there
is
a
great
deal
of
wasted
happiness
in
this
world
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
that
very
thing
dennis
was
not
given
to
making
long
calls
on
his
parishioners
there
were
too
many
of
them
and
he
had
too
little
time
but
he
made
an
unprecedentedly
long
one
on
marion
wilbur
when
she
went
back
to
her
room
that
night
the
fire
was
gone
out
utterly
not
even
a
smoke
remained
she
lighted
her
smoky
little
lamp
there
was
no
gas
in
the
third
story
and
looked
at
her
watch
with
an
amazed
air
she
had
not
imagined
that
it
could
be
nearly
then
she
pushed
the
reports
into
a
drawer
and
turned
the
key
no
use
to
attempt
reports
for
that
evening
as
she
picked
up
her
the
scribbling
on
the
caught
her
eye
again
she
smiled
a
rare
rich
happy
smile
then
swiftly
she
drew
her
pencil
and
added
one
more
name
to
the
line
marion
wilbur
marion
wilbur
it
read
there
was
just
room
on
the
line
for
another
word
then
it
read
marion
wilbur
dennis
to
be
sure
she
took
her
rubber
quickly
from
her
pocket
and
obliterated
every
trace
of
that
last
but
what
of
it
there
are
words
and
deeds
that
can
not
so
easily
be
obliterated
and
marion
as
she
laid
her
grateful
head
on
her
fluffy
little
pillow
that
night
was
thankful
it
was
so
and
felt
no
desire
to
erase
them
desolate
not
she
god
was
very
gracious
the
brightness
that
she
felt
sure
she
could
throw
around
some
lives
she
knew
would
have
a
reflex
brightness
for
her
then
queerly
enough
the
very
next
thing
she
thought
of
was
that
dainty
supper
she
planned
for
herself
that
she
could
have
prepared
for
a
wet
hungry
and
tired
why
not
for
a
if
she
had
no
sister
to
do
it
for
why
not
for
a
daughter
dear
little
gracie
she
said
then
she
went
to
sleep
meantime
during
that
eventful
evening
ruth
sat
in
her
room
alone
busy
with
grave
and
solemn
thoughts
her
father
was
already
many
miles
away
he
had
gone
to
see
his
wife
and
daughter
eurie
at
that
same
hour
was
bending
anxiously
over
a
sick
mother
trying
to
catch
the
direction
with
such
a
heavy
heavy
pain
at
her
heart
but
the
same
patient
wise
father
was
watching
over
and
directing
the
ways
of
each
of
his
four
girls

although
the
sense
of
desolation
was
gone
from
flossy
shipley
she
was
not
without
something
to
be
troubled
over
as
to
that
when
one
sets
out
to
be
troubled
one
can
nearly
always
find
an
excuse
flossy
lay
awake
over
hers
for
hours
that
night
roberts
was
given
to
keeping
more
proper
hours
than
those
in
which
party
goers
indulge
so
it
happened
that
the
library
was
vacant
when
the
family
returned
the
gas
turned
low
and
the
grate
carefully
supplied
with
coal
to
give
them
a
warm
greeting
but
the
easy
chairs
before
the
bright
fire
told
no
tales
of
all
the
pleasant
and
helpful
words
that
had
been
spoken
there
that
evening
so
far
as
the
family
knew
flossy
had
spent
her
evening
in
solitude
but
they
would
come
to
know
it
would
have
to
be
introduced
to
roberts
there
would
have
to
be
a
prompt
explanation
of
their
interest
in
each
other
flossy
meant
to
have
no
delays
nor
chances
for
mistakes
this
time
the
momentous
question
was
how
would
her
father
receive
the
message
what
word
would
he
have
for
the
stranger
she
could
almost
have
wished
that
his
coming
had
been
delayed
for
a
few
weeks
more
until
the
sore
sullen
feeling
over
disappointed
plans
had
had
time
to
quiet
but
as
it
was
since
roberts
was
to
be
in
the
city
and
she
was
to
see
him
she
would
have
no
pretense
of
his
being
merely
a
chance
acquaintance
of
her
chautauqua
life
making
friendly
calls
at
least
her
father
should
know
that
they
both
meant
more
than
that
whether
he
would
ignore
the
claims
they
made
and
choose
to
treat
roberts
as
a
stranger
flossy
did
not
know
it
seemed
more
than
likely
that
he
would
as
to
that
she
could
not
help
owning
to
herself
that
he
would
have
very
plausible
reasons
for
so
doing
what
was
she
supposed
to
know
about
evan
roberts
closely
questioned
she
would
have
to
admit
that
she
had
never
heard
of
his
existence
till
those
golden
chautauqua
days
that
although
she
walked
and
talked
much
with
him
during
those
two
weeks
there
had
been
so
much
to
talk
about
such
vital
interests
that
pressed
upon
them
so
many
things
for
her
to
learn
that
they
had
spent
no
time
at
all
in
talking
about
each
other
past
she
remembered
now
that
strangely
enough
she
had
no
idea
even
at
this
moment
what
his
business
was
except
that
from
some
casual
remark
she
judged
that
he
was
familiar
with
mercantile
life
he
might
have
some
money
or
he
might
be
very
poor
she
had
not
the
least
idea
which
it
was
he
might
be
of
an
old
and
honored
family
or
his
father
might
have
been
a
blacksmith
and
his
mother
even
now
a
she
admitted
to
herself
that
she
knew
nothing
at
all
about
it
and
she
was
obliged
also
to
admit
that
so
far
as
she
herself
was
concerned
she
did
not
care
but
shipley
was
very
different
most
assuredly
he
would
care
how
could
he
understand
why
she
should
be
able
to
feel
such
perfect
trust
in
this
stranger
if
she
should
try
to
tell
him
of
those
wonderful
prayers
she
had
heard
from
robert
lips
what
would
such
evidence
be
to
him
if
she
should
try
to
tell
him
how
by
this
man
she
had
been
led
into
the
light
of
love
and
trust
that
glowed
brighter
and
stronger
with
every
day
how
little
information
it
would
give
him
what
an
utter
mystery
would
such
language
be
to
him
as
she
thought
of
all
these
puzzling
things
what
wonder
that
she
turned
her
pillow
many
times
in
search
of
a
spot
to
rest
and
gave
a
great
many
sighs
it
so
happened
that
roberts
while
he
had
not
troubled
himself
to
enlighten
flossy
as
to
his
position
and
prospects
had
by
no
means
supposed
that
her
father
would
be
as
indifferent
to
these
small
matters
as
she
was
he
had
come
armed
with
credentials
and
introductions
overwhelming
ones
they
were
to
shipley
he
waited
for
no
introductions
nor
explanations
to
come
from
flossy
instead
the
very
next
morning
at
the
earliest
hour
that
business
etiquette
would
allow
he
sought
shipley
at
his
business
office
presented
his
card
and
letters
and
made
known
his
desire
to
transact
mercantile
business
with
him
in
the
name
of
his
firm
and
the
rich
man
shipley
arose
and
bowed
before
him
was
he
not
a
representative
nay
a
junior
partner
of
the
firm
of
bostwick
smythe
roberts
names
among
mercantile
men
could
human
ambition
reach
higher
than
to
have
flattering
offers
of
business
from
that
great
house
than
to
be
actually
sought
out
by
this
young
partner
singled
from
among
all
the
merchant
princes
of
the
city
as
the
one
to
be
taken
into
business
confidence
shipley
ambitious
dreams
reached
no
more
dizzy
height
than
this
roberts
was
invited
urged
to
accept
the
hospitalities
of
his
home
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
his
family
to
command
his
horses
his
carriage
his
servants
in
short
to
become
one
of
their
family
so
long
as
he
could
be
prevailed
upon
to
remain
in
the
city
but
roberts
had
more
communications
to
make
he
frankly
announced
that
he
was
already
acquainted
with
his
family
at
least
with
that
portion
of
it
which
was
of
enough
importance
to
include
all
the
rest
of
course
he
did
not
say
this
to
the
father
and
yet
his
manner
implied
it
as
he
meant
it
should
roberts
was
frank
by
nature
he
no
more
believed
in
concealments
of
any
sort
than
did
flossy
then
and
there
he
told
the
story
that
the
two
easy
chairs
in
the
library
knew
about
he
even
apologized
earnestly
for
seeking
the
daughter
first
it
had
not
been
his
intention
he
had
meant
to
call
on
the
family
but
they
were
absent
and
he
found
miss
flossy
alone
and
well
if
shipley
had
been
particular
as
assuredly
he
would
have
been
if
roberts
had
not
been
of
the
firm
of
bostwick
smythe
roberts
it
might
have
been
embarrassing
to
have
explained
the
very
precipitate
result
of
his
call
but
as
it
was
shipley
was
so
amazed
and
so
bewildered
and
so
overwhelmed
with
delighted
pride
that
he
would
almost
have
forgiven
the
announcement
that
roberts
was
already
his
without
leave
or
license
from
him
as
it
was
all
the
caution
had
to
be
on
robert
side
he
asked
that
letters
might
be
sent
to
his
smythe
to
his
father
james
roberts
proving
not
his
financial
standing
the
unmistakable
knowledge
of
the
private
affairs
of
the
firm
that
had
established
him
there
but
of
his
moral
character
and
his
standing
in
the
christian
world
do
you
believe
that
shipley
felt
the
necessity
not
he
had
he
not
been
willing
more
than
that
anxious
that
his
daughter
fortune
should
be
linked
with
baker
did
he
not
know
what
was
standing
in
the
moral
and
christian
world
after
all
is
it
any
wonder
when
there
are
such
fathers
that
many
daughters
make
shipwreck
of
their
lives
as
for
roberts
he
was
almost
indignant
the
man
would
actually
sell
her
if
by
that
means
he
could
be
recognized
in
business
by
our
house
if
it
had
been
any
other
young
man
than
himself
who
was
in
question
how
his
indignation
would
have
blazed
at
such
proceedings
but
since
it
himself
he
decided
to
accept
the
situation
as
for
flossy
she
did
not
look
at
the
matter
in
that
light
when
she
found
that
all
the
perplexities
and
clouds
had
been
so
suddenly
and
so
strangely
smoothed
and
cleared
from
before
her
way
she
thought
of
those
hours
of
wakeful
anxiety
that
she
had
wasted
the
night
before
and
of
how
finally
she
had
made
her
heart
settle
back
on
the
watchful
care
and
love
of
the
father
who
was
so
wise
and
so
powerful
and
in
the
quiet
of
her
own
room
she
smiled
as
she
said
aloud
thy
way
unto
the
lord
trust
also
in
him
and
he
shall
bring
it
to
pass
how
much
pleasanter
it
would
have
been
to
have
committed
it
in
the
first
place
before
i
wearied
my
heart
with
worrying
over
what
i
could
not
lift
my
finger
to
make
different
so
in
less
time
than
it
has
taken
me
to
tell
it
the
rough
places
smoothed
suddenly
before
flossy
shipley
feet
she
was
free
now
to
go
to
parties
or
to
or
to
stay
at
home
according
to
her
own
fancy
for
was
she
not
the
promised
wife
of
a
partner
of
the
firm
of
bostwick
smythe
roberts
it
transpired
that
roberts
had
come
to
make
a
somewhat
extended
stay
in
the
city
to
look
after
certain
business
affairs
connected
with
the
firm
and
also
to
look
after
certain
business
interests
of
the
great
master
whose
work
he
labored
at
with
untiring
persistence
always
placing
it
above
all
other
plans
and
working
at
it
with
a
zeal
that
showed
his
heart
was
there
flossy
during
these
days
took
great
strides
as
a
learner
in
christian
work
among
other
things
she
was
let
into
the
mysteries
of
some
of
the
great
and
systematic
charities
of
the
city
and
found
what
wonderful
things
god
wealth
could
do
placed
in
the
hands
of
careful
and
conscientious
stewards
she
had
thought
at
first
that
it
made
no
difference
at
all
to
her
whether
roberts
had
to
work
for
his
daily
bread
or
whether
he
had
means
at
his
disposal
but
very
early
in
her
acquaintance
with
him
she
learned
to
thank
god
that
great
wealth
had
been
placed
in
his
hands
and
so
was
to
be
at
her
disposal
and
that
she
was
learning
how
to
use
it
some
of
her
new
experiences
had
their
embarrassing
side
roberts
had
been
but
a
few
days
in
the
city
when
he
had
certain
proteges
which
circumstance
had
thrown
in
his
way
in
whom
he
became
deeply
interested
one
of
these
he
engaged
to
take
flossy
to
visit
they
are
very
poor
he
had
said
to
her
supposing
that
thereby
he
enlightened
her
now
flossy
had
small
knowledge
in
that
direction
there
was
a
certain
old
lady
living
at
the
extreme
east
end
who
had
once
been
a
servant
in
their
family
and
flossy
nurse
in
her
flossy
was
much
interested
and
had
been
often
to
see
her
she
kept
house
in
a
bit
of
a
room
that
was
always
shining
with
cleanliness
her
floor
was
covered
with
bright
rag
carpeting
her
bed
was
spread
with
a
gay
covered
quilt
and
her
little
cook
stove
glistened
and
the
bright
teakettle
sputtered
cheerily
this
was
flossy
idea
of
poverty
therefore
when
she
arrayed
herself
for
a
wintry
walk
with
roberts
there
was
to
her
mind
no
incongruity
between
the
rich
black
silk
the
velvet
cloak
the
elegant
laces
and
costly
furs
and
the
very
poor
family
she
was
about
to
visit
why
should
there
be
she
had
trailed
that
same
silk
over
old
auntie
green
bright
colored
rag
carpet
a
good
many
times
without
experiencing
any
discomfort
therefrom
as
for
roberts
he
regarded
her
with
a
half
amused
smile
which
she
did
not
observe
and
said
nothing
probably
he
had
an
idea
that
she
would
soon
be
wiser
than
she
was
then
it
is
too
far
to
walk
he
said
as
they
reached
a
point
where
street
cars
diverged
in
many
directions
so
he
hailed
a
passing
car
and
during
the
talk
that
followed
flossy
was
conveyed
to
a
portion
of
the
city
she
not
only
had
never
seen
before
but
that
she
did
not
know
existed
she
looked
about
her
in
dismay
as
she
stepped
down
from
the
car
and
during
the
short
rapid
walk
that
followed
had
all
she
could
do
to
rescue
her
silken
robes
from
contact
with
awful
filth
and
to
keep
her
dainty
handkerchief
applied
to
her
poor
little
nose
rapidly
and
silently
they
made
their
way
to
a
long
high
building
whose
filthy
outside
stairs
they
descended
and
found
themselves
in
a
cellar
the
like
of
which
flossy
had
never
dreamed
of
a
dreadful
pile
of
straw
covered
over
by
a
tattered
and
horribly
dirty
rag
that
had
once
been
a
quilt
on
this
bed
lay
a
child
not
yet
ten
years
old
whose
deathly
pale
face
and
glassy
eyes
told
the
story
of
hopeless
sickness
no
pillow
on
which
to
lay
the
poor
little
head
with
its
tangled
masses
of
yellow
hair
nothing
anywhere
that
told
of
care
bestowed
or
necessary
wants
attended
to
over
in
another
corner
on
another
filthy
heap
of
straw
and
rags
lay
the
mother
sick
too
with
the
same
absence
of
anything
like
decency
in
everything
that
pertained
to
her
utter
dismay
seized
upon
flossy
could
it
be
possible
that
human
beings
beings
with
souls
for
whose
souls
her
blessed
saviour
died
were
left
to
such
awful
desolation
of
poverty
as
this
roberts
promptly
turned
upside
down
an
old
tub
that
was
used
to
doing
duty
as
a
chair
and
seated
her
thereon
while
he
went
forward
to
the
woman
have
you
had
your
dinner
was
the
first
question
he
asked
yes
i
have
and
thank
you
kindly
too
she
added
gratefully
the
woman
took
the
money
and
bought
meat
as
you
told
her
and
made
a
broth
and
i
and
the
little
girl
had
some
it
was
good
the
little
girl
took
quite
a
few
spoonfuls
of
it
and
said
it
tasted
good
it
did
me
more
good
to
hear
her
say
that
than
it
did
to
eat
mine
the
poor
mother
said
and
a
wistful
motherly
look
went
over
to
the
heap
of
rags
in
the
corner
i
am
glad
that
she
could
eat
it
he
said
simply
then
he
further
told
that
he
had
been
arranging
for
some
things
to
be
brought
to
make
both
of
them
more
comfortable
they
would
be
here
soon
could
the
woman
who
made
the
broth
come
in
and
attend
to
them
the
sick
woman
shook
her
head
she
was
gone
for
the
day
would
not
be
back
till
dark
then
would
have
to
get
her
children
supper
and
do
her
washing
that
very
night
she
poor
the
woman
added
with
a
heavy
sigh
we
are
all
of
us
that
if
i
could
get
up
again
i
could
do
something
for
my
little
girl
i
most
know
i
could
but
as
it
is
and
then
there
was
that
hopeless
sigh
meantime
flossy
after
sitting
with
a
distressed
and
irresolute
face
for
a
few
minutes
had
suddenly
risen
from
her
tub
and
gone
over
to
the
little
girl
bending
beside
her
they
had
talked
together
in
a
low
voice
and
as
roberts
turned
to
see
if
she
had
endured
the
scene
as
long
as
her
nerves
would
admit
she
turned
towards
him
and
there
was
more
decision
in
her
voice
than
he
had
ever
heard
before
roberts
can
you
find
some
clean
water
for
this
basin
and
you
a
large
handkerchief
with
you
this
poor
child
must
have
her
face
washed
she
says
her
head
aches
very
badly
that
will
help
it
and
roberts
ca
you
go
out
immediately
to
the
store
and
get
some
clothes
for
this
bed
and
a
pillow
do
they
have
such
things
in
stores
i
have
seen
to
that
he
said
there
will
be
some
bed
clothing
here
and
other
necessaries
very
soon
but
how
can
we
manage
to
have
the
beds
made
up
i
have
ordered
bedsteads
and
mattresses
and
bed
clothing
has
been
prepared
but
i
have
failed
thus
far
in
getting
anyone
to
help
arrange
them
ca
you
set
up
a
bedstead
asked
miss
flossy
why
i
think
i
could
he
answered
her
meekly
very
well
then
i
can
make
the
beds
as
for
the
child
she
must
have
a
bath
and
a
clean
dress
before
she
is
ready
for
any
bed
i
can
tell
you
just
what
to
do
roberts
you
must
go
down
to
the
east
end
no
south
benedict
street
and
find
my
old
auntie
green
and
tell
her
that
she
is
needed
here
just
as
soon
as
she
can
get
here
tell
her
i
want
her
it
will
be
all
right
then
in
the
meantime
this
child
face
must
be
washed
and
her
hair
combed
i
see
there
is
a
kettle
behind
that
stove
could
you
manage
to
fill
it
with
water
and
then
could
you
make
a
better
fire
then
i
can
stay
here
and
do
a
good
many
things
while
you
are
gone
while
our
little
flossy
was
talking
she
was
removing
her
lavendar
kid
gloves
and
pinning
up
out
of
sight
her
lace
ruffles
then
she
produced
from
some
one
of
the
bewildering
and
dainty
pockets
that
trimmed
her
dress
a
plain
hemstitched
handkerchief
which
she
unceremoniously
dropped
into
the
tin
basin
and
announced
herself
all
ready
for
the
water
but
flossy
said
her
embarrassed
attendant
in
dismay
you
ca
do
these
things
you
know
would
it
be
better
to
come
with
me
and
we
will
go
after
this
auntie
green
and
tell
her
just
what
to
do
and
furnish
the
means
to
do
it
with
you
know
you
are
not
used
to
anything
of
this
kind
i
know
it
she
said
quietly
i
never
knew
there
was
anything
like
this
in
the
world
i
am
bowed
in
the
very
dust
with
shame
and
dismay
there
is
very
little
that
i
know
how
to
do
but
i
can
wash
this
poor
neglected
child
face
go
right
away
please
there
is
no
time
to
lose
i
am
sure
what
swift
deft
fingers
she
had
to
be
sure
he
could
not
help
stopping
for
a
moment
in
his
bewilderment
to
watch
her
then
he
went
and
meekly
and
swiftly
did
her
bidding
there
was
much
done
during
that
afternoon
roberts
quietly
sinking
into
the
errand
man
who
was
useful
chiefly
because
he
could
promptly
do
as
he
was
told
and
he
felt
with
every
additional
direction
and
with
every
passing
moment
an
increased
respect
for
the
executive
abilities
of
the
little
girl
whom
he
had
looked
forward
to
rousing
by
degrees
to
a
sense
of
the
importance
of
this
work
and
gradually
to
a
participation
in
other
than
the
money
charities
of
the
day
when
they
went
away
from
that
door
as
they
ascended
the
filthy
stairs
again
she
said
what
an
awful
thought
that
human
beings
exist
in
such
places
as
this
and
that
i
did
not
know
it
and
have
done
nothing
for
them
she
was
certainly
not
exhausted
not
overcome
with
the
stench
and
the
filth
though
there
was
water
dripping
at
that
moment
from
her
rich
silk
dress
she
noticed
it
and
as
she
brushed
off
the
drops
she
said
evan
if
you
knew
i
wonder
that
you
did
not
tell
me
to
wear
my
chautauqua
dress
i
shall
know
better
next
time
i
must
have
that
poor
little
girl
cured
there
are
ever
so
many
things
to
do
oh
evan
you
must
teach
me
how
you
need
no
teacher
he
said
softly
almost
reverently
other
than
the
divine
teacher
whom
you
have
had
i
am
become
a
learner

flossy
party
marion
on
her
way
from
school
had
stopped
in
to
learn
if
she
could
what
shadow
had
fallen
over
ruth
but
before
anything
like
confidence
had
been
reached
flossy
shipley
came
full
of
life
and
eagerness
i
am
so
glad
to
find
two
of
you
together
she
said
it
expedites
matters
so
much
who
do
you
think
can
be
going
to
give
a
party
next
a
party
said
marion
i
am
sure
i
do
know
i
am
prepared
for
any
sort
of
news
on
that
subject
one
would
think
there
had
been
a
party
famine
for
years
and
lost
time
was
to
be
made
up
to
see
the
manner
in
which
one
entertainment
crowds
after
another
since
the
meetings
closed
it
is
a
mercy
that
i
am
never
invited
it
would
take
all
my
leisure
and
a
great
deal
of
note
paper
to
prepare
regrets
who
is
it
i
have
the
least
idea
that
you
could
guess
so
i
am
going
to
tell
you
it
just
myself
both
of
her
listeners
looked
incredulous
i
am
she
said
gleefully
i
am
at
work
on
the
arrangements
now
as
hard
as
i
can
be
and
marion
wilbur
you
need
go
to
talking
about
note
paper
and
regrets
you
are
to
come
i
shall
have
to
give
up
eurie
and
i
am
sorry
too
she
would
have
helped
along
so
much
but
of
course
she
can
not
leave
her
mother
how
is
her
mother
asked
both
girls
at
once
oh
better
nellis
says
the
doctor
feels
very
hopeful
now
but
of
course
eurie
does
leave
her
and
can
not
for
a
long
time
nellis
mitchell
is
a
splendid
fellow
how
strange
it
is
that
his
interest
in
religious
matters
should
have
commenced
with
that
letter
which
eurie
sent
him
from
chautauqua
before
she
had
much
interest
herself
nobody
supposed
that
he
had
i
am
sure
ruth
said
i
thought
him
the
most
indifferent
of
mortals
so
did
i
and
would
never
have
thought
to
pray
for
him
at
all
if
eurie
had
not
asked
me
to
specially
did
you
know
he
led
the
young
meeting
last
evening
did
splendidly
grace
dennis
said
by
the
way
is
grace
dennis
lovely
marion
do
you
think
she
is
the
most
interesting
young
lady
in
your
room
i
think
you
do
enlighten
us
much
in
regard
to
that
party
marion
said
her
cheeks
growing
red
under
that
last
question
i
ought
to
be
on
my
way
my
tea
will
be
colder
than
usual
if
i
hasten
what
scheme
have
you
now
flossy
and
what
do
you
want
to
do
with
it
ever
so
many
things
you
know
my
boys
well
they
are
really
young
men
and
anyone
can
see
how
they
have
improved
some
of
them
have
real
good
homes
to
be
sure
but
the
most
of
them
are
friendless
sort
of
boys
now
i
want
to
get
them
acquainted
not
with
the
frippery
people
who
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
them
but
with
some
of
our
real
splendid
boys
and
girls
who
will
enjoy
helping
them
i
going
to
have
the
nicest
little
party
i
ever
had
in
my
life
i
mean
to
have
some
of
the
very
best
people
there
then
i
shall
have
some
of
the
silly
ones
of
course
partly
because
i
ca
help
it
and
partly
because
i
want
to
show
them
what
a
nice
time
reasonable
beings
can
have
together
if
they
choose
nellis
mitchell
is
enlisted
to
help
me
in
ever
so
many
ways
and
roberts
will
do
what
he
can
but
you
know
he
is
a
stranger
my
great
dependence
is
on
you
two
i
want
you
to
see
to
it
that
my
boys
feel
lonely
or
out
of
place
one
single
minute
during
the
entire
evening
but
i
am
afraid
i
shall
feel
lonely
and
out
of
place
marion
said
you
know
i
am
never
invited
to
parties
flossy
laughed
would
it
be
a
strange
sight
to
see
you
feeling
out
of
place
she
asked
gaily
marion
i
ca
conceive
of
a
place
to
which
you
do
credit
whereupon
marion
arose
and
made
a
low
courtesy
thank
you
she
said
in
mock
gravity
i
never
had
a
compliment
before
in
my
life
i
shall
certainly
come
there
is
nothing
like
a
little
flattery
to
win
people
do
be
nonsensical
pleaded
flossy
i
am
really
in
earnest
ruth
i
may
depend
upon
you
i
know
you
are
not
going
to
entertainments
this
winter
but
mine
is
to
be
a
small
one
compared
with
the
others
and
you
know
it
will
be
unlike
any
that
we
have
had
at
our
house
ruth
hesitated
when
is
it
to
be
she
asked
her
cheeks
glowing
over
her
own
thoughts
i
shall
be
engaged
on
friday
evening
of
next
week
it
is
to
be
on
wednesday
then
i
will
come
and
if
i
play
marion
will
you
sing
to
entertain
the
unusual
guests
of
course
marion
said
promptly
i
never
sang
in
company
in
my
life
but
do
you
suppose
there
is
anything
i
will
not
do
for
flossy
guests
after
what
she
has
just
said
only
flossy
i
shall
have
to
wear
my
black
cashmere
wear
your
brown
calico
if
you
choose
you
look
royal
in
it
flossy
said
turning
a
beaming
face
on
marion
she
had
heard
her
sing
she
knew
what
a
rare
musical
treat
it
would
be
to
those
boys
of
hers
so
this
was
flossy
last
departure
from
the
beaten
track
those
who
are
familiar
with
the
imperative
laws
and
lines
which
circumscribe
the
fashionable
world
will
realize
just
how
marked
a
departure
it
was
it
was
a
remarkable
party
the
very
highest
and
most
sought
after
of
the
fashionable
world
were
there
a
few
of
them
and
john
warden
was
there
in
his
new
business
suit
of
grey
looking
and
feeling
like
a
man
flossy
boys
were
all
present
and
those
who
knew
of
them
and
their
associations
and
advantages
marvelled
much
at
their
ease
of
manner
and
perfect
propriety
of
behaviour
how
could
they
have
learned
so
much
flossy
did
not
know
herself
but
the
boys
did
her
exquisite
grace
of
manner
her
perfect
observance
of
all
the
rules
and
courtesies
of
polite
society
in
her
intercourse
with
them
had
produced
its
legitimate
fruit
had
instinctively
inclined
them
to
be
able
to
treat
her
with
the
same
sort
of
grace
which
she
freely
and
everywhere
bestowed
on
them
had
she
not
met
them
on
the
street
in
the
very
heart
of
broadway
when
she
was
walking
with
some
of
her
fashionable
friends
had
she
not
taken
pains
to
recognize
them
with
a
specially
cordial
bow
and
if
near
enough
with
a
deliberate
speaking
of
their
names
being
sure
to
slightly
emphasize
the
unusual
prefix
these
and
a
hundred
other
kindred
trifles
so
small
that
they
are
not
noted
among
the
qualifications
for
teachers
so
powerful
for
good
that
they
often
turn
the
current
of
a
human
life
had
been
carefully
regarded
by
flossy
and
she
was
triumphant
over
her
success
she
had
not
only
helped
her
boys
to
be
true
to
their
convictions
of
right
and
dignity
not
only
to
take
on
true
manliness
of
decision
in
regard
to
the
all
important
question
of
personal
religion
she
had
helped
them
to
be
gentlemen
there
is
many
a
faithful
teacher
to
whom
thinking
of
these
minor
matters
it
might
be
said
these
ought
ye
to
have
done
and
not
to
have
left
the
other
undone
from
first
to
last
flossy
party
was
a
success
to
ruth
and
marion
it
was
a
study
developing
certain
curious
features
which
they
never
forgot
marion
had
her
own
private
bit
of
interest
that
not
another
present
save
gracie
dennis
knew
about
she
was
not
a
party
goer
even
so
small
a
gathering
as
this
was
new
to
her
she
looked
upon
all
these
people
with
a
keen
interest
many
of
them
she
was
meeting
for
the
first
time
that
is
she
was
being
introduced
to
them
and
receiving
their
kindly
greetings
for
flossy
had
succeeded
in
gathering
only
those
who
whatever
they
might
think
of
her
choice
of
guests
were
much
too
well
bred
to
exhibit
other
than
pleasure
while
they
were
her
guests
but
only
marion
knew
that
she
was
destined
to
meet
these
people
again
and
probably
often
under
different
circumstances
the
probability
was
that
many
of
them
would
be
her
own
guests
would
receive
and
return
her
calls
would
fall
into
the
habit
of
consulting
her
in
regard
to
this
or
that
matter
of
church
interest
that
would
come
up
not
one
of
them
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
and
when
she
tried
to
lead
them
into
conversation
on
matters
pertaining
to
the
church
interests
they
looked
their
surprise
that
she
should
have
such
intelligent
knowledge
concerning
these
matters
altogether
it
was
an
evening
full
of
private
fun
on
her
part
there
was
to
be
such
a
curious
turn
about
of
position
she
realized
so
fully
that
it
would
be
such
unutterable
surprise
to
the
people
that
it
was
impossible
not
to
feel
amused
and
to
treasure
up
certain
words
and
phrases
that
would
sound
very
queerly
to
the
speakers
thereof
if
they
remembered
them
when
those
said
changes
became
manifest
to
the
eyes
of
the
world
there
was
more
than
fun
to
be
gotten
out
of
the
evening
she
watched
the
young
people
with
eager
interest
she
was
to
be
a
great
deal
to
these
young
people
she
must
try
to
understand
them
to
win
them
she
wanted
to
be
a
help
a
comfort
a
guide
she
had
wonderful
plans
and
aims
she
blessed
flossy
in
her
heart
for
this
opportunity
to
study
her
lesson
before
it
should
be
time
to
practise
it
that
same
flossy
afforded
her
help
in
another
direction
there
was
no
hiding
the
hold
that
she
had
gotten
not
only
on
those
young
men
of
her
class
but
those
of
their
friends
that
they
had
brought
within
her
influence
there
was
no
disguising
the
fact
that
among
the
young
ladies
she
was
a
favorite
one
whom
they
liked
to
have
among
them
whom
they
liked
to
please
how
had
she
done
it
all
i
can
never
be
flossy
marion
said
to
herself
an
amused
smile
hovering
around
her
lips
meanwhile
at
the
thought
that
she
should
have
a
shadow
of
desire
to
become
their
little
flossy
but
it
is
worth
while
to
steal
her
secret
of
success
if
i
can
and
practise
it
close
watching
revealed
a
good
deal
of
the
secret
as
much
of
it
at
least
as
could
be
put
into
words
evidently
the
little
lady
had
the
power
of
making
other
people
interests
her
own
for
the
time
being
of
impressing
the
one
with
whom
she
came
in
contact
with
a
sense
of
his
own
importance
in
her
eyes
at
least
she
was
interested
in
what
he
said
and
did
and
in
what
interested
him
she
could
enter
into
the
minute
details
of
a
matter
which
did
not
concern
her
in
the
least
with
such
apparent
interest
and
desire
to
know
all
that
was
to
be
known
about
it
that
one
could
hardly
help
the
feeling
that
certainly
the
subject
was
worthy
of
attention
then
her
face
spoke
for
her
it
could
cloud
in
an
instant
in
sympathy
with
any
sort
of
trouble
or
anxiety
and
sparkle
with
happy
smiles
in
the
very
next
second
over
some
bit
of
brightness
that
was
mentioned
she
is
a
blessed
little
hypocrite
and
that
is
the
whole
of
it
was
marion
mental
comment
that
sort
of
hypocrisy
is
worth
studying
it
is
as
natural
to
flossy
as
that
lovely
pink
on
her
cheek
but
i
am
afraid
i
should
have
to
acquire
it
i
do
feel
interested
in
other
people
affairs
now
that
is
a
fact
why
should
she
in
the
first
place
i
know
it
is
natural
for
her
to
like
to
please
people
that
is
the
beginning
of
it
she
has
that
advantage
over
me
for
she
was
always
so
and
i
always
so
but
she
has
something
else
she
did
not
care
once
to
please
such
as
these
rough
boys
of
hers
at
least
they
were
rough
when
she
started
the
refining
process
how
she
had
worked
for
them
i
never
realized
it
so
much
as
it
is
just
this
she
has
sanctified
her
power
of
pleasing
and
put
it
to
a
grand
use
in
fishing
for
souls
meantime
i
have
some
degree
of
power
of
that
kind
though
it
does
show
in
the
same
way
but
i
am
not
sure
i
have
thought
of
it
with
a
view
to
using
it
for
such
work
also
i
dare
say
one
can
cultivate
an
interest
in
other
people
if
they
try
i
mean
to
try
i
know
one
way
in
which
i
can
please
people
i
can
sing
whereupon
she
immediately
sought
ruth
and
proposed
music
herself
going
after
rich
johnson
to
come
and
sing
tenor
and
bidding
him
bring
a
friend
to
sing
bass
then
such
music
as
they
had
that
evening
was
certainly
never
heard
at
a
party
at
shipley
house
before
the
music
room
was
a
little
bower
of
a
spot
at
the
left
of
the
parlors
it
was
not
only
the
music
room
but
the
flower
room
at
least
there
were
vines
and
plants
and
blooming
flowers
in
the
windows
festooning
the
curtains
hanging
from
lovely
wire
baskets
a
profusion
everywhere
thither
went
ruth
marion
and
the
two
young
men
who
went
in
silence
from
very
astonishment
over
this
new
invitation
in
silence
and
embarrassment
believing
in
their
hearts
that
they
could
not
sing
at
all
as
for
marion
she
knew
better
she
had
stood
near
them
in
ruth
swept
the
piano
clear
of
all
sheet
music
and
substituted
the
bliss
and
sankey
gospel
hymns
and
marion
passed
a
book
to
each
naming
a
page
and
instantly
her
full
grand
voice
joined
ruth
music
very
faint
were
the
tenor
and
bass
accompaniments
but
as
the
first
verse
closed
and
they
entered
upon
the
second
the
melody
had
gotten
possession
of
their
hearts
and
they
let
out
their
voices
without
knowing
it
so
that
when
the
piece
was
ended
marion
turned
with
a
bright
face
and
said
i
have
enjoyed
a
song
so
much
in
years
what
a
splendid
tenor
you
sing
mr
johnson
to
herself
she
said
there
i
improving
i
honestly
think
that
but
hours
ago
i
should
have
kept
it
to
myself
it
is
hypocrisy
after
all
it
is
sincerity
another
and
another
piece
was
tried
the
music
room
meantime
filling
for
flossy
had
brought
in
her
train
others
of
the
boys
and
at
last
as
the
last
verse
of
hold
the
fort
rang
out
marion
turned
from
the
piano
to
discover
that
utmost
silence
prevailed
in
the
rooms
where
chatter
had
been
before
and
every
available
place
in
and
about
the
music
room
was
filled
with
hushed
listeners
while
those
who
could
not
get
in
sat
or
stood
outside
in
silence
and
wrapt
attention
such
music
as
that
at
a
party
they
had
never
heard
before
you
and
i
are
a
success
i
think
marion
said
brightly
as
she
linked
her
hand
in
ruth
arm
when
they
left
the
piano
we
are
doing
our
duty
beautifully
are
you
complimenting
yourself
because
you
are
afraid
no
one
will
perform
that
office
ruth
asked
laughing
no
i
doing
it
because
i
have
begun
to
be
sincere
i
made
a
discovery
ruth
it
is
you
and
i
who
are
hypocritical
in
refusing
to
say
what
we
think
about
people
when
it
would
sound
real
nicely
and
would
doubtless
make
them
feel
pleasanter
and
happier
meantime
ruth
had
her
lesson
also
that
she
had
been
learning
what
a
trial
parties
had
always
been
to
her
how
haughtily
she
had
stood
aloof
enduring
with
annoyed
heart
and
oftentimes
with
curling
lip
sillinesses
that
she
could
not
avoid
listening
to
conversations
and
joining
in
monosyllables
when
obliged
to
do
so
that
drove
her
to
the
very
verge
of
patience
not
once
imagining
that
there
was
any
help
for
her
any
hope
of
stemming
the
current
or
in
any
way
changing
the
accepted
course
of
things
she
was
learning
several
times
during
the
evening
it
had
been
her
fortune
to
stand
near
evan
roberts
and
join
in
the
conversation
which
he
was
carrying
on
each
time
she
was
amazed
and
thrilled
to
see
with
what
consummate
skill
and
tact
he
turned
the
current
of
thought
towards
the
vital
question
of
personal
religion
always
with
an
easy
familiarity
of
expression
that
made
one
feel
and
realize
that
to
him
it
was
a
matter
of
course
and
as
natural
to
be
talked
about
as
the
sunshine
or
the
moonlight
wondering
over
this
peculiarity
of
his
once
as
they
talked
together
she
referred
to
it
i
can
conceive
of
parties
being
less
of
a
trial
to
you
than
to
many
of
us
because
of
the
ability
you
have
of
turning
the
conversation
to
some
account
he
smiled
brightly
they
are
not
he
said
i
have
often
looked
forward
to
an
evening
gathering
with
eager
interest
and
thankfulness
because
of
the
opportunity
for
meeting
some
there
whom
i
could
not
catch
elsewhere
and
saying
a
word
for
my
master
but
miss
erskine
you
speak
of
i
simply
use
my
tongue
on
that
subject
as
on
any
other
worthy
of
thought
but
do
you
think
it
requires
a
peculiar
sort
of
tact
to
be
able
to
bring
in
such
subjects
in
a
manner
calculated
to
do
any
good
he
shook
his
head
i
should
say
rather
it
required
a
sincere
heart
and
an
earnest
desire
to
interest
a
soul
we
depend
too
much
on
tact
and
too
little
on
god
spirit
thy
mouth
and
i
will
fill
it
is
a
promise
that
applies
to
more
places
than
a
i
think
what
we
need
most
to
overcome
is
the
idea
that
there
is
anything
wicked
in
talking
about
religion
in
an
everyday
tone
as
we
talk
about
other
topics
of
absorbing
interest
there
are
different
ways
of
going
to
parties
ruth
said
to
herself
in
a
musing
tone
as
she
turned
from
him
and
she
wondered
if
she
could
ever
get
to
feel
that
she
might
even
go
to
a
party
occasionally
with
the
glory
of
god
in
view
this
started
a
train
of
thought
that
made
her
turn
suddenly
back
to
roberts
with
a
question
that
doctrine
would
lead
you
to
be
a
constant
frequenter
of
parties
would
it
he
shook
his
head
by
no
means
and
there
are
parties
many
of
them
which
as
a
christian
man
i
could
not
attend
at
all
we
must
guard
against
a
temptation
to
do
evil
that
good
may
come

a
parting
glance
dennis
and
his
friend
the
rev
harrison
met
again
at
the
street
corner
they
stopped
and
shook
hands
as
they
always
did
even
if
they
chanced
to
meet
three
times
in
one
day
meetings
closed
questioned
harrison
after
the
preliminary
words
had
been
spoken
what
a
glorious
time
you
have
had
such
a
pity
that
our
flocks
are
so
far
apart
if
we
could
have
united
with
you
in
regular
attendance
it
would
have
been
a
great
blessing
as
it
was
many
a
drop
came
to
us
yes
dennis
said
we
have
had
a
great
blessing
and
i
need
not
use
the
past
tense
the
work
is
going
on
yet
although
the
meetings
do
not
continue
the
work
will
continue
forever
i
believe
the
truth
is
we
have
had
a
new
baptism
the
members
who
came
to
us
early
in
the
fall
came
filled
with
the
spirit
and
have
worked
as
no
other
members
of
mine
ever
did
you
mean
your
chautauqua
reinforcement
do
you
indeed
i
do
i
thank
god
for
chautauqua
every
day
of
my
life
what
a
dreadful
blunder
i
made
when
i
limited
the
power
of
god
in
the
way
i
did
when
we
talked
that
matter
over
you
remember
i
remember
harrison
said
with
a
peculiar
laugh
it
was
a
wonderful
meeting
but
then
after
all
were
they
not
rather
peculiar
young
ladies
it
is
every
lady
who
even
after
she
is
converted
lives
just
the
sort
of
life
that
they
are
living
i
know
dennis
said
yes
they
are
unusual
i
think
especially
one
of
them
was
his
mental
addition
especially
one
of
them
murmured
harrison
in
his
heart
and
each
gentleman
smiled
consciously
neither
having
the
slightest
idea
what
the
other
meant
by
the
smile
marion
wilbur
came
down
the
street
with
her
hands
full
of
school
books
said
dennis
how
do
you
do
this
evening
harrison
do
you
know
this
lady
she
is
one
of
my
flock
no
harrison
did
not
know
her
and
introductions
followed
after
she
passed
by
harrison
said
i
think
you
told
me
once
that
she
had
been
an
infidel
it
was
a
mistake
dennis
said
hastily
she
had
peculiar
views
and
i
think
she
imagined
herself
at
one
time
an
unbeliever
but
she
is
really
wonderfully
well
grounded
in
the
doctrines
of
the
church
she
is
like
an
old
christian
many
of
dennis
people
were
abroad
the
next
passer
by
was
eurie
mitchell
the
doctor
stopped
her
one
minute
miss
eurie
how
is
your
mother
harrison
do
you
know
miss
mitchell
the
daughter
yes
harrison
had
met
miss
mitchell
before
in
the
fast
coming
dusk
dennis
failed
to
see
the
flush
of
embarrassment
on
his
cheek
as
he
acknowledged
the
introduction
she
is
a
grand
girl
dennis
said
looking
after
her
her
development
is
wonderful
more
marked
of
late
i
think
than
before
well
as
you
say
they
were
unusual
girls
but
i
tell
you
we
as
pastors
have
reason
to
say
bless
chautauqua
amen
said
harrison
and
dennis
thought
him
unusually
earnest
and
intense
especially
when
he
added
i
propose
we
go
next
year
and
take
with
us
as
many
of
our
respective
flocks
as
we
can
beguile
into
it
aye
that
we
will
dennis
answered
then
the
two
gentlemen
went
on
their
respective
ways
it
was
a
large
city
and
they
were
both
busy
ministers
and
lived
far
apart
and
met
but
seldom
except
in
their
ministerial
meetings
there
was
chance
for
each
to
have
interests
that
the
other
knew
nothing
about
marion
reached
home
just
in
time
for
supper
the
table
appointments
at
that
home
were
not
improving
indeed
there
were
those
who
said
that
the
bread
grew
sourer
every
week
this
week
it
had
added
to
its
sourness
stickiness
that
was
horrible
to
one
fingers
and
throat
the
dried
fruit
that
had
been
half
stewed
was
sweetened
with
brown
sugar
and
the
looking
over
process
so
necessary
to
dried
fruit
had
been
wholly
neglected
but
marion
ate
her
supper
almost
entirely
unconscious
of
these
little
defects
that
is
she
accepted
them
as
a
matter
of
course
and
looked
serene
over
it
things
were
not
as
they
had
been
on
that
rainy
evening
when
it
had
seemed
to
her
that
she
could
never
no
eat
another
supper
in
that
house
then
it
seemed
probable
that
in
that
house
or
one
like
unto
it
she
would
have
to
eat
all
the
suppers
that
this
dreary
life
had
in
store
for
her
but
now
the
days
were
growing
fewer
in
which
this
house
would
be
called
her
home
no
one
knew
it
at
least
no
one
but
herself
and
two
others
she
looked
around
on
her
fellow
boarders
with
a
pitying
smile
that
little
at
her
left
how
such
suppers
would
she
have
to
eat
she
shall
have
a
nice
one
every
now
and
then
see
if
she
does
was
marion
mental
conclusion
with
a
nod
of
her
glad
head
there
were
so
many
nice
things
to
be
done
life
was
so
bright
had
gracie
dennis
whispered
to
her
this
very
afternoon
miss
wilbur
one
of
these
days
i
shall
hate
to
come
to
school
i
shall
want
to
stay
at
home
and
she
answered
softly
surreptitiously
kissing
the
glowing
cheek
meanwhile
the
teacher
who
reigns
here
shall
be
your
special
friend
and
you
are
to
bring
her
home
with
you
to
lovely
little
teas
that
shall
be
waiting
for
you
this
matter
of
teas
had
gotten
a
strong
hold
on
marion
perhaps
because
in
no
other
way
had
a
sense
of
unhomelike
loneliness
pressed
upon
her
as
at
that
time
when
families
generally
gathered
together
in
pretty
homes
she
went
up
presently
to
her
dingy
room
just
every
whit
as
dingy
now
as
it
had
been
on
that
rainy
evening
but
she
gave
no
thought
at
all
to
it
she
lighted
her
fire
and
sat
down
to
her
writing
not
reports
she
must
write
a
letter
to
aunt
hannah
a
brief
letter
it
was
but
containing
a
great
deal
this
was
it
dear
aunt
hannah
do
you
think
i
am
going
to
be
married
now
you
never
expected
that
of
me
did
you
neither
did
i
but
that
is
the
way
the
matter
stands
now
the
question
is
may
i
come
home
to
the
wedding
the
old
is
all
the
home
i
have
you
know
i
hope
you
will
let
us
come
i
am
giving
you
plenty
of
notice
we
shall
not
want
to
come
until
after
the
spring
term
one
of
us
wants
to
be
there
by
the
seventeenth
of
june
i
thought
i
ought
to
tell
you
before
the
spring
let
me
hear
from
you
as
soon
as
you
can
so
that
i
may
know
how
to
plan
i
could
be
married
in
the
church
i
presume
but
i
feel
and
the
other
one
concerned
feels
so
too
that
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
the
old
we
wo
make
much
trouble
nor
have
any
fuss
you
know
dear
aunt
hannah
i
am
so
glad
the
money
gave
you
comfort
then
i
am
so
glad
that
you
thought
about
that
other
matter
of
which
i
wrote
that
is
the
greatest
and
best
thing
to
have
in
the
world
i
think
so
now
when
i
am
on
the
eve
of
other
blessings
that
one
stands
before
them
all
the
gentleman
whom
i
am
to
marry
is
a
minister
he
is
very
good
aunt
hannah
i
shall
want
your
advice
about
all
sorts
of
sewing
when
i
come
home
i
shall
come
in
may
that
is
if
you
let
me
come
at
all
i
hope
you
will
give
my
love
to
uncle
reuben
my
friend
sends
his
respects
to
you
both
lovingly
marion
j
wilbur
she
had
a
fondness
during
those
days
for
writing
out
that
name
in
full
a
gentle
tap
at
the
door
being
answered
admitted
flossy
shipley
you
darling
said
marion
brightly
as
she
gave
her
eager
greeting
how
nice
of
you
to
come
and
see
me
when
you
have
so
much
to
think
of
flossy
where
is
roberts
why
do
you
bring
him
to
call
on
me
he
has
time
to
call
on
anybody
flossy
said
with
a
mixture
of
pride
and
a
sort
of
comic
pettishness
he
has
so
many
poor
families
on
his
hands
he
and
i
have
been
out
all
day
marion
you
have
no
idea
at
all
of
the
places
where
we
have
been
i
do
think
there
ought
to
be
an
organized
system
of
charity
in
our
church
something
different
from
the
way
of
doing
things
that
we
have
roberts
says
that
in
new
york
their
church
is
perfectly
organized
to
look
after
certain
localities
and
that
no
such
thing
as
utter
destitution
can
prevail
in
their
section
do
you
think
dennis
would
be
interested
in
such
an
effort
he
will
be
interested
in
anything
that
is
good
marion
said
with
unusual
energy
even
for
her
flossy
turned
her
pretty
head
towards
her
and
eyed
her
curiously
you
like
him
better
than
you
did
do
you
marion
did
i
always
like
him
marion
asked
with
averted
face
and
a
laugh
in
her
voice
oh
you
used
to
think
him
stiff
and
said
you
felt
all
shut
up
in
his
presence
do
you
remember
our
first
call
at
his
study
i
think
i
do
marion
answered
bursting
into
a
merry
laugh
ever
so
many
things
have
happened
since
then
little
flossy
have
there
said
innocent
flossy
it
has
been
such
a
wonderful
year
dating
from
that
day
when
it
rained
and
you
me
go
do
you
remember
marion
do
you
ever
get
to
wondering
what
would
have
been
if
we
had
just
stayed
on
here
at
home
going
to
our
parties
and
getting
up
festivals
and
all
that
and
paying
no
attention
to
the
chautauqua
meetings
i
do
want
to
think
about
any
such
horrid
retrospect
as
that
marion
said
with
a
shrug
of
her
handsome
shoulders
and
a
genuine
shiver
flossy
laughed
but
you
know
it
is
only
something
to
think
of
to
make
us
more
grateful
it
can
never
by
the
way
i
suppose
it
is
early
to
begin
to
make
plans
for
the
summer
at
least
for
those
who
have
no
occasion
to
talk
about
summer
yet
this
last
with
a
conscious
little
laugh
but
do
you
mean
to
go
to
chautauqua
next
summer
roberts
and
i
are
going
we
would
rather
give
up
a
journey
to
europe
than
that
ca
we
all
contrive
to
meet
there
together
yes
said
marion
we
mean
to
go
dennis
is
going
flossy
said
though
why
that
had
anything
to
do
with
the
matter
or
why
it
occurred
to
her
just
then
flossy
did
not
know
he
told
roberts
that
he
meant
to
be
there
and
to
take
with
him
as
many
of
his
people
as
he
could
and
eurie
told
me
last
night
that
his
friend
harrison
of
the
fourth
church
was
going
i
do
know
how
eurie
heard
that
through
nellis
i
suppose
is
nellis
splendid
nowadays
i
should
wonder
if
quite
a
large
company
went
from
here
i
wonder
if
dennis
will
take
his
daughter
grace
i
think
she
is
just
lovely
do
you
very
said
marion
and
just
here
flossy
roused
to
the
fact
that
she
was
doing
most
of
the
talking
and
that
marion
answers
were
often
in
monosyllables
i
dare
say
i
am
tiring
you
she
said
rising
i
forget
that
you
have
to
talk
all
day
in
that
marion
are
you
sure
you
love
to
teach
well
enough
to
keep
at
it
year
after
year
no
said
marion
laughing
i
know
i
do
i
do
mean
to
do
it
i
mean
to
get
a
situation
as
somebody
housekeeper
do
you
understand
housekeeping
asked
innocent
little
flossy
with
wide
open
eyes
oh
marion
are
you
sure
it
will
be
even
as
pleasant
as
school
teaching
i
think
so
marion
answered
with
grave
face
at
least
i
mean
to
try
it
depends
on
whose
house
you
get
into
you
know
flossy
sober
face
cleared
in
an
instant
so
it
does
she
said
marion
i
have
a
nice
plan
but
i
shall
not
tell
you
a
bit
about
it
oh
the
dear
blessed
little
goosie
marion
said
laughing
immoderately
as
the
door
closed
after
flossy
now
i
know
as
well
as
if
she
told
me
that
she
is
going
to
beguile
roberts
into
offering
me
a
situation
in
their
dove
cote
when
they
set
it
up
blessed
little
darling
and
here
the
laugh
changed
into
a
bright
tear
i
know
just
what
a
sweet
and
happy
home
she
would
make
for
me
if
i
had
only
that
to
look
forward
to
if
it
had
just
opened
as
my
escape
from
this
boarding
house
how
very
thankful
i
should
be
how
glad
the
dear
child
will
be
to
know
that
my
home
is
as
nearly
in
view
as
her
own
as
for
flossy
she
went
down
the
walk
saying
what
a
dismal
room
that
is
it
is
too
bad
for
our
bright
marion
to
have
to
live
in
it
i
know
my
plan
will
work
how
nice
of
her
to
have
put
it
in
my
head
my
head
must
be
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
out
nice
things
that
somebody
else
proposes
oh
dear
there
are
so
many
desolate
homes
here
on
earth
a
cloud
over
the
bright
face
for
a
minute
then
it
cleared
as
she
said
softly
in
my
father
house
are
many
mansions
i
go
to
prepare
a
place
for
you
after
all
that
was
the
place
for
brightness
this
was
only
a
way
station
never
mind
the
discomforts
so
that
many
were
helped
to
the
right
road
that
the
home
be
reached
at
last
in
peace
she
paused
at
the
corner
and
looked
towards
eurie
home
but
shook
her
head
resolutely
she
must
not
go
there
it
was
too
late
though
she
longed
to
tell
eurie
that
marion
was
going
to
chautauqua
and
ask
her
if
she
did
not
think
it
possible
for
them
all
to
meet
there
then
the
inconsistent
little
creature
sighed
again
for
she
remembered
eurie
weary
face
and
the
long
struggle
with
sickness
and
the
long
struggle
with
ways
and
means
to
which
she
was
looking
forward
there
was
much
in
the
world
that
she
would
like
to
brighten
meantime
eurie
in
her
home
around
the
corner
was
arranging
the
pillows
with
tender
touch
about
her
mother
head
and
drawing
the
folds
of
the
crimson
shawl
carefully
about
her
as
she
said
now
mother
you
begin
to
look
like
yourself
it
makes
a
wonderful
difference
to
get
a
touch
of
color
about
you
a
very
tender
smile
preceded
her
answer
dear
child
i
will
be
glad
to
get
well
enough
so
that
you
may
have
a
chance
to
get
a
touch
of
color
about
you
you
are
looking
very
pale
and
tired
oh
me
mine
is
the
brightest
life
you
can
imagine
there
is
plenty
of
color
down
in
my
heart
so
long
as
i
can
think
of
our
nell
leading
the
young
people
meeting
and
father
to
lead
at
the
mission
it
will
rest
me
i
have
to
keep
my
marcies
to
crown
them
all
here
you
are
sitting
up
at
this
time
of
night
with
a
cap
and
wrapper
on
once
more
instead
of
that
unbecoming
white
gown
how
pleased
father
will
be
we
have
many
mercies
the
low
feeble
voice
of
the
invalid
said
not
the
least
among
them
being
our
daughter
eurie
but
i
could
wish
that
i
saw
a
way
for
you
to
have
less
care
and
more
rest
than
you
will
get
this
summer
i
must
be
willing
to
be
very
useless
your
father
says
and
that
means
hard
work
for
you
when
ruth
erskine
was
in
this
afternoon
looking
so
quiet
and
at
rest
nothing
to
weary
her
or
hinder
her
from
doing
what
she
chose
i
just
coveted
some
of
the
peace
of
her
life
for
you
there
no
occasion
mother
i
am
not
by
any
means
willing
to
exchange
my
life
with
hers
i
like
my
own
much
the
best
as
for
rest
do
you
worry
there
be
a
way
planned
for
what
rest
i
need
yes
and
there
was
being
a
way
planned
even
then
though
mother
and
daughter
knew
nothing
of
it
how
queerly
people
go
on
planning
their
lives
as
though
they
had
the
roads
opening
out
into
the
future
all
under
their
own
care
it
was
at
that
moment
that
ruth
erskine
the
young
lady
who
according
to
mitchell
had
so
quiet
and
settled
and
peaceful
a
life
that
she
coveted
it
for
her
daughter
stood
in
the
great
hall
that
was
glowing
with
light
and
beauty
and
caught
her
breath
with
an
almost
convulsive
sound
as
she
rested
against
a
chair
for
support
her
face
deathly
pale
her
eyes
bright
with
a
calm
that
she
had
forced
upon
herself
in
her
solemn
determination
to
try
to
do
just
the
right
thing
say
just
the
right
words
her
ear
had
caught
the
sound
of
a
carriage
that
had
drawn
up
before
the
door
and
the
sound
of
a
familiar
voice
she
knew
that
she
was
now
to
meet
not
only
her
father
but
her
mother
and
sister
little
they
knew
about
each
other
even
yet
with
all
their
intimacy
those
four
chautauqua
girls
but
what
mattered
it
so
long
as
they
had
given
themselves
over
body
and
soul
into
the
keeping
of
their
father
in
heaven
who
knew
not
only
the
beginning
but
the
end
