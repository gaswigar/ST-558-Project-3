this

from
an

dated
published
by
macmillan

and
new

greek
text
has
been
transliterated
and
marked
with
brackets
as
in
the
opening
citation
above
preface
if
a
new
translation
of
herodotus
does
not
justify
itself
it
will
hardly
be
justified
in
a
preface
therefore
the
question
whether
it
was
needed
may
be
left
here
without
discussion
the
aim
of
the
translator
has
been
above
all
things
to
the
manner
of
expression
and
to
the
structure
of
sentences
as
well
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
author
at
the
same
time
it
is
conceived
that
the
freedom
and
variety
of
herodotus
is
not
always
best
reproduced
by
such
severe
consistency
of
rendering
as
is
perhaps
desirable
in
the
case
of
the
epic
writers
before
and
the
philosophical
writers
after
his
time
nor
again
must
his
simplicity
of
thought
and
occasional
quaintness
be
reproduced
in
the
form
of
archaisms
of
language
and
that
not
only
because
the
affectation
of
an
archaic
style
would
necessarily
be
offensive
to
the
reader
but
also
because
in
language
herodotus
is
not
archaic
his
style
is
the
best
canon
of
the
ionic
speech
marked
however
not
so
much
by
primitive
purity
as
by
eclectic
variety
at
the
same
time
it
is
characterised
largely
by
the
poetic
diction
of
the
epic
and
tragic
writers
and
while
the
translator
is
free
to
employ
all
the
resources
of
modern
english
so
far
as
he
has
them
at
his
command
he
must
carefully
retain
this
poetical
colouring
and
by
all
means
avoid
the
courtier
phrase
by
which
the
style
of
herodotus
has
too
often
been
made
more
noble
as
regards
the
text
from
which
this
translation
has
been
made
it
is
based
upon
that
of
stein
critical
edition
berlin
that
is
to
say
the
estimate
there
made
of
the
comparative
value
of
the
authorities
has
been
on
the
whole
accepted
as
a
just
one
rather
than
that
which
depreciates
the
value
of
the
medicean
and
of
the
class
to
which
it
belongs
on
the
other
hand
the
conjectural
emendations
proposed
by
stein
have
very
seldom
been
adopted
and
his
text
has
been
departed
from
in
a
large
number
of
other
instances
also
which
will
for
the
most
part
be
found
recorded
in
the
notes
as
it
seemed
that
even
after
stein
of
the
medicean
there
were
doubts
felt
by
some
scholars
as
to
the
true
reading
in
some
places
of
this
which
is
very
generally
acknowledged
to
be
the
most
important
i
thought
it
right
to
examine
it
myself
in
all
those
passages
where
questions
about
text
arise
which
concern
a
translator
that
is
in
nearly
five
hundred
places
altogether
and
the
results
when
they
are
worth
observing
are
recorded
in
the
notes
at
the
same
time
by
the
suggestion
of
stein
i
a
large
part
of
the
third
book
in
the
which
is
commonly
referred
to
as
f
florentinus
called
by
stein
c
and
i
examined
this
also
in
a
certain
number
of
other
places
it
should
be
understood
that
wherever
in
the
notes
i
mention
the
reading
of
any
particular
by
name
i
do
so
on
my
own
authority
the
notes
have
been
confined
to
a
tolerably
small
compass
their
purpose
is
first
in
cases
where
the
text
is
doubtful
to
indicate
the
reading
adopted
by
the
translator
and
any
other
which
may
seem
to
have
reasonable
probability
but
without
discussion
of
the
authorities
secondly
where
the
rendering
is
not
quite
literal
and
in
other
cases
where
it
seemed
desirable
to
quote
the
words
of
the
original
or
to
give
a
more
literal
version
thirdly
to
add
an
alternative
version
in
cases
where
there
seems
to
be
a
doubt
as
to
the
true
meaning
and
lastly
to
give
occasionally
a
short
explanation
or
a
reference
from
one
passage
of
the
author
to
another
for
the
orthography
of
proper
names
reference
may
be
made
to
the
note
prefixed
to
the
index
no
consistent
system
has
been
adopted
and
the
result
will
therefore
be
open
to
criticism
in
many
details
but
the
aim
has
been
to
avoid
on
the
one
hand
the
pedantry
of
seriously
altering
the
form
of
those
names
which
are
fairly
established
in
the
english
language
of
literature
as
distinguished
from
that
of
scholarship
and
on
the
other
hand
the
absurdity
of
looking
to
latin
rather
than
to
greek
for
the
orthography
of
the
names
which
are
not
so
established
there
is
no
intention
to
put
forward
any
theory
about
pronunciation
the
index
of
proper
names
will
it
is
hoped
be
found
more
complete
and
accurate
than
those
hitherto
published
the
best
with
which
i
was
acquainted
i
found
to
have
so
many
errors
and
omissions
that
i
was
compelled
to
do
the
work
again
from
the
beginning
in
a
collection
of
more
than
ten
thousand
references
there
must
in
all
probability
be
mistakes
but
i
trust
they
will
be
found
to
be
few
my
acknowledgments
of
obligation
are
due
first
to
stein
both
for
his
critical
work
and
also
for
his
most
excellent
commentary
which
i
have
had
always
by
me
after
this
i
have
made
most
use
of
the
editions
of
krüger
bähr
abicht
and
in
the
first
two
books
woods
as
to
translations
i
have
had
rawlinson
before
me
while
revising
my
own
work
and
i
have
referred
also
occasionally
to
the
translations
of
littlebury
perhaps
the
best
english
version
as
regards
style
but
full
of
gross
errors
taylor
and
larcher
in
the
second
book
i
have
also
used
the
version
of
reprinted
by
lang
of
the
first
book
of
this
translation
i
have
access
only
to
a
fragment
written
out
some
years
ago
when
the
british
museum
was
within
my
reach
other
particular
obligations
are
acknowledged
in
the
notes
notes

see
the
remarks
of

in
the

specimens
of

bruxelles
woods
for
example
in
his
edition
of
the
first
book
published
in
gives
a
list
of
readings
for
the
first
and
second
books
in
which
he
almost
invariably
prefers
the
authority
of
gronovius
to
that
of
stein
where
their
reports
differ
in
so
doing
he
is
wrong
in
all
cases
i
think
except
one
namely
i
to

is
wrong

in
the
index
of

names
attached
to

edition
berlin
to
which
i
am
under
obligation
having
checked
my
own
by
it
i
find
that
i
have
marked
upwards
of
two
hundred
mistakes
or
oversights
no
doubt
i
have
been
saved
by
it
from
at
least
as
many
the
history
of
herodotus
book
i
the
first
book
of
the
histories
called
clio
this
is
the
showing
forth
of
the
inquiry
of
herodotus
of
halicarnassos
to
the
end
that
neither
the
deeds
of
men
may
be
forgotten
by
lapse
of
time
nor
the
works
great
and
marvellous
which
have
been
produced
some
by
hellenes
and
some
by
barbarians
may
lose
their
renown
and
especially
that
the
causes
may
be
remembered
for
which
these
waged
war
with
one
another
those
of
the
persians
who
have
knowledge
of
history
declare
that
the
phenicians
first
began
the
quarrel
these
they
say
came
from
that
which
is
called
the
erythraian
sea
to
this
of
ours
and
having
settled
in
the
land
where
they
continue
even
now
to
dwell
set
themselves
forthwith
to
make
long
voyages
by
sea
and
conveying
merchandise
of
egypt
and
of
assyria
they
arrived
at
other
places
and
also
at
argos
now
argos
was
at
that
time
in
all
points
the
first
of
the
states
within
that
land
which
is
now
called
hellas
phenicians
arrived
then
at
this
land
of
argos
and
began
to
dispose
of
their
ship
cargo
and
on
the
fifth
or
sixth
day
after
they
had
arrived
when
their
goods
had
been
almost
all
sold
there
came
down
to
the
sea
a
great
company
of
women
and
among
them
the
daughter
of
the
king
and
her
name
as
the
hellenes
also
agree
was
io
the
daughter
of
inachos
these
standing
near
to
the
stern
of
the
ship
were
buying
of
the
wares
such
as
pleased
them
most
when
of
a
sudden
the
phenicians
passing
the
word
from
one
to
another
made
a
rush
upon
them
and
the
greater
part
of
the
women
escaped
by
flight
but
io
and
certain
others
were
carried
off
so
they
put
them
on
board
their
ship
and
forthwith
departed
sailing
away
to
egypt
in
this
manner
the
persians
report
that
io
came
to
egypt
not
agreeing
therein
with
the
hellenes
and
this
they
say
was
the
first
beginning
of
wrongs
then
after
this
they
say
certain
hellenes
but
the
name
of
the
people
they
are
not
able
to
report
put
in
to
the
city
of
tyre
in
phenicia
and
carried
off
the
king
daughter
europa
would
doubtless
be
cretans
so
they
were
quits
for
the
former
injury
after
this
however
the
hellenes
they
say
were
the
authors
of
the
second
wrong
for
they
sailed
in
to
aia
of
colchis
and
to
the
river
phasis
with
a
ship
of
war
and
from
thence
after
they
had
done
the
other
business
for
which
they
came
they
carried
off
the
king
daughter
medea
and
the
king
of
colchis
sent
a
herald
to
the
land
of
hellas
and
demanded
satisfaction
for
the
rape
and
to
have
his
daughter
back
but
they
answered
that
as
the
barbarians
had
given
them
no
satisfaction
for
the
rape
of
io
the
argive
so
neither
would
they
give
satisfaction
to
the
barbarians
for
this
in
the
next
generation
after
this
they
say
alexander
the
son
of
priam
having
heard
of
these
things
desired
to
get
a
wife
for
himself
by
violence
from
hellas
being
fully
assured
that
he
would
not
be
compelled
to
give
any
satisfaction
for
this
wrong
inasmuch
as
the
hellenes
gave
none
for
theirs
so
he
carried
off
helen
and
the
hellenes
resolved
to
send
messengers
first
and
to
demand
her
back
with
satisfaction
for
the
rape
and
when
they
put
forth
this
demand
the
others
alleged
to
them
the
rape
of
medea
saying
that
the
hellenes
were
now
desiring
satisfaction
to
be
given
to
them
by
others
though
they
had
given
none
themselves
nor
had
surrendered
the
person
when
demand
was
made
up
to
this
point
they
say
nothing
more
happened
than
the
carrying
away
of
women
on
both
sides
but
after
this
the
hellenes
were
very
greatly
to
blame
for
they
set
the
first
example
of
war
making
an
expedition
into
asia
before
the
barbarians
made
any
into
europe
now
they
say
that
in
their
judgment
though
it
is
an
act
of
wrong
to
carry
away
women
by
force
it
is
a
folly
to
set
one
heart
on
taking
vengeance
for
their
rape
and
the
wise
course
is
to
pay
no
regard
when
they
have
been
carried
away
for
it
is
evident
that
they
would
never
be
carried
away
if
they
were
not
themselves
willing
to
go
and
the
persians
say
that
they
namely
the
people
of
asia
when
their
women
were
carried
away
by
force
had
made
it
a
matter
of
no
account
but
the
hellenes
on
account
of
a
woman
of
lacedemon
gathered
together
a
great
armament
and
then
came
to
asia
and
destroyed
the
dominion
of
priam
and
that
from
this
time
forward
they
had
always
considered
the
hellenic
race
to
be
their
enemy
for
asia
and
the
barbarian
races
which
dwell
there
the
persians
claim
as
belonging
to
them
but
europe
and
the
hellenic
race
they
consider
to
be
parted
off
from
them
the
persians
for
their
part
say
that
things
happened
thus
and
they
conclude
that
the
beginning
of
their
quarrel
with
the
hellenes
was
on
account
of
the
taking
of
ilion
but
as
regards
io
the
phenicians
do
not
agree
with
the
persians
in
telling
the
tale
thus
for
they
deny
that
they
carried
her
off
to
egypt
by
violent
means
and
they
say
on
the
other
hand
that
when
they
were
in
argos
she
was
intimate
with
the
master
of
their
ship
and
perceiving
that
she
was
with
child
she
was
ashamed
to
confess
it
to
her
parents
and
therefore
sailed
away
with
the
phenicians
of
her
own
will
for
fear
of
being
found
out
these
are
the
tales
told
by
the
persians
and
the
phenicians
severally
and
concerning
these
things
i
am
not
going
to
say
that
they
happened
thus
or
thus
but
when
i
have
pointed
to
the
man
who
first
within
my
own
knowledge
began
to
commit
wrong
against
the
hellenes
i
shall
go
forward
further
with
the
story
giving
an
account
of
the
cities
of
men
small
as
well
as
great
for
those
which
in
old
times
were
great
have
for
the
most
part
become
small
while
those
that
were
in
my
own
time
great
used
in
former
times
to
be
small
so
then
since
i
know
that
human
prosperity
never
continues
steadfast
i
shall
make
mention
of
both
indifferently
croesus
was
lydian
by
race
the
son
of
alyattes
and
ruler
of
the
nations
which
dwell
on
this
side
of
the
river
halys
which
river
flowing
from
the
south
between
the
syrians
and
the
paphlagonians
runs
out
towards
the
north
wind
into
that
sea
which
is
called
the
euxine
this
croesus
first
of
all
the
barbarians
of
whom
we
have
knowledge
subdued
certain
of
the
hellenes
and
forced
them
to
pay
tribute
while
others
he
gained
over
and
made
them
his
friends
those
whom
he
subdued
were
the
ionians
the
aiolians
and
the
dorians
who
dwell
in
asia
and
those
whom
he
made
his
friends
were
the
lacedemonians
but
before
the
reign
of
croesus
all
the
hellenes
were
free
for
the
expedition
of
the
kimmerians
which
came
upon
ionia
before
the
time
of
croesus
was
not
a
conquest
of
the
cities
but
a
plundering
incursion
only
now
the
supremacy
which
had
belonged
to
the
heracleidai
came
to
the
family
of
croesus
called
mermnadai
in
the
following
manner
whom
the
hellenes
call
myrsilos
was
ruler
of
sardis
and
a
descendant
of
alcaios
son
of
heracles
for
agron
the
son
of
ninos
the
son
of
belos
the
son
of
alcaios
was
the
first
of
the
heracleidai
who
became
king
of
sardis
and
candaules
the
son
of
myrsos
was
the
last
but
those
who
were
kings
over
this
land
before
agrond
were
descendants
of
lydos
the
son
of
atys
whence
this
whole
nation
was
called
lydian
having
been
before
called
meonian
from
these
the
heracleidai
descended
from
heracles
and
the
of
iardanos
obtained
the
government
being
charged
with
it
by
reason
of
an
oracle
and
they
reigned
for
generations
of
men
five
hundred
and
five
years
handing
on
the
power
from
father
to
son
till
the
time
of
clandaules
the
son
of
myrsos
this
candaules
then
of
whom
i
speak
had
become
passionately
in
love
with
his
own
wife
and
having
become
so
he
deemed
that
his
wife
was
fairer
by
far
than
all
other
women
and
thus
deeming
to
gyges
the
son
of
daskylos
for
he
of
all
his
spearmen
was
the
most
pleasing
to
him
to
this
gyges
i
say
he
used
to
impart
as
well
the
more
weighty
of
his
affairs
as
also
the
beauty
of
his
wife
praising
it
above
measure
and
after
no
long
time
since
it
was
destined
that
evil
should
happen
to
candaules
he
said
to
gyges
as
follows
gyges
i
think
that
thou
dost
not
believe
me
when
i
tell
thee
of
the
beauty
of
my
wife
for
it
happens
that
men
ears
are
less
apt
of
belief
than
their
eyes
contrive
therefore
means
by
which
thou
mayest
look
upon
her
naked
but
he
cried
aloud
and
said
master
what
word
of
unwisdom
is
this
which
thou
dost
utter
bidding
me
look
upon
my
mistress
naked
when
a
woman
puts
off
her
tunic
she
puts
off
her
modesty
also
moreover
of
old
time
those
fair
sayings
have
been
found
out
by
men
from
which
we
ought
to
learn
wisdom
and
of
these
one
is
this
each
man
should
look
on
his
own
but
i
believe
indeed
that
she
is
of
all
women
the
fairest
and
i
entreat
thee
not
to
ask
of
me
that
which
it
is
not
lawful
for
me
to
do
with
such
words
as
these
he
resisted
fearing
lest
some
evil
might
come
to
him
from
this
but
the
king
answered
him
thus
be
of
good
courage
gyges
and
have
no
fear
either
of
me
that
i
am
saying
these
words
to
try
thee
or
of
my
wife
lest
any
harm
may
happen
to
thee
from
her
for
i
will
contrive
it
so
from
the
first
that
she
shall
not
even
perceive
that
she
has
been
seen
by
thee
i
will
place
thee
in
the
room
where
we
sleep
behind
the
open
door
and
after
i
have
gone
in
my
wife
also
will
come
to
lie
down
now
there
is
a
seat
near
the
entrance
of
the
room
and
upon
this
she
will
lay
her
garments
as
she
takes
them
off
one
by
one
and
so
thou
wilt
be
able
to
gaze
upon
her
at
full
leisure
and
when
she
goes
from
the
chair
to
the
bed
and
thou
shalt
be
behind
her
back
then
let
it
be
thy
part
to
take
care
that
she
sees
thee
not
as
thou
goest
through
the
door
he
then
since
he
might
not
avoid
it
gave
consent
and
candaules
when
he
considered
that
it
was
time
to
rest
led
gyges
to
the
chamber
and
straightway
after
this
the
woman
also
appeared
and
gyges
looked
upon
her
after
she
came
in
and
as
she
laid
down
her
garments
and
when
she
had
her
back
turned
towards
him
as
she
went
to
the
bed
then
he
slipped
away
from
his
and
was
going
forth
and
as
he
went
out
the
woman
caught
sight
of
him
and
perceiving
that
which
had
been
done
by
her
husband
she
did
not
cry
out
though
struck
with
shame
but
she
made
as
though
she
had
not
perceived
the
matter
meaning
to
avenge
herself
upon
candaules
for
among
the
lydians
as
also
among
most
other
barbarians
it
is
a
shame
even
for
a
man
to
be
seen
naked
at
the
time
then
she
kept
silence
as
i
say
and
made
no
outward
sign
but
as
soon
as
day
had
dawned
and
she
made
ready
those
of
the
servants
whom
she
perceived
to
be
the
most
attached
to
herself
and
after
that
she
sent
to
summon
gyges
he
then
not
supposing
that
anything
of
that
which
had
been
done
was
known
to
her
came
upon
her
summons
for
he
had
been
accustomed
before
to
go
whenever
the
queen
summoned
him
and
when
gyges
was
come
the
woman
said
to
him
these
words
there
are
now
two
ways
open
to
thee
gyges
and
i
give
thee
the
choice
which
of
the
two
thou
wilt
prefer
to
take
either
thou
must
slay
candaules
and
possess
both
me
and
the
kingdom
of
lydia
or
thou
must
thyself
here
on
the
spot
be
slain
so
that
thou
mayest
not
in
future
by
obeying
candaules
in
all
things
see
that
which
thou
shouldest
not
either
he
must
die
who
formed
this
design
or
thou
who
hast
looked
upon
me
naked
and
done
that
which
is
not
accounted
lawful
for
a
time
then
gyges
was
amazed
at
these
words
and
afterwards
he
began
to
entreat
her
that
she
would
not
bind
him
by
necessity
to
make
such
a
choice
then
however
as
he
could
not
prevail
with
her
but
saw
that
necessity
was
in
truth
set
before
him
either
to
slay
his
master
or
to
be
himself
slain
by
others
he
made
the
choice
to
live
himself
and
he
inquired
further
as
follows
since
thou
dost
compel
me
to
take
my
master
life
against
my
own
will
let
me
hear
from
thee
also
what
is
the
manner
in
which
we
shall
lay
hands
upon
him
and
she
answering
said
from
that
same
place
shall
the
attempt
be
where
he
displayed
me
naked
and
we
will
lay
hands
upon
him
as
he
sleeps
so
after
they
had
prepared
the
plot
when
night
came
on
for
gyges
was
not
let
go
nor
was
there
any
way
of
escape
for
him
but
he
must
either
be
slain
himself
or
slay
candaules
he
followed
the
woman
to
the
bedchamber
and
she
gave
him
a
dagger
and
concealed
him
behind
that
very
same
door
then
afterwards
while
candaules
was
sleeping
gyges
came
privily
up
to
him
and
slew
him
and
he
obtained
both
his
wife
and
his
kingdom
of
him
moreover
archilochos
the
parian
who
lived
about
that
time
made
mention
in
a
trimeter
iambic
verse
he
obtained
the
kingdom
however
and
was
strengthened
in
it
by
means
of
the
oracle
at
delphi
for
when
the
lydians
were
angry
because
of
the
fate
of
candaules
and
had
risen
in
arms
a
treaty
was
made
between
the
followers
of
gyges
and
the
other
lydians
to
this
effect
that
if
the
oracle
should
give
answer
that
he
was
to
be
king
of
the
lydians
he
should
be
king
and
if
not
he
should
give
back
the
power
to
the
sons
of
heracles
so
the
oracle
gave
answer
and
gyges
accordingly
became
king
yet
the
pythian
prophetess
said
this
also
that
vengeance
for
the
heracleidai
should
come
upon
the
descendants
of
gyges
in
the
fifth
generation
of
this
oracle
the
lydians
and
their
kings
made
no
account
until
it
was
in
fact
fulfilled
thus
the
mermnadai
obtained
the
government
having
driven
out
from
it
the
heracleidai
and
gyges
when
he
became
ruler
sent
votive
offerings
to
delphi
not
a
few
for
of
all
the
silver
offerings
at
delphi
his
are
more
in
number
than
those
of
any
other
man
and
besides
the
silver
he
offered
a
vast
quantity
of
gold
and
especially
one
offering
which
is
more
worthy
of
mention
than
the
rest
namely
six
golden
which
are
dedicated
there
as
his
gift
of
these
the
weight
is
thirty
talents
and
they
stand
in
the
treasury
of
the
corinthians
though
in
truth
this
treasury
does
not
belong
to
the
state
of
the
corinthians
but
is
that
of
kypselos
the
son
of
aëtion
this
gyges
was
the
first
of
the
barbarians
within
our
knowledge
who
dedicated
votive
offerings
at
delphi
except
only
midas
the
son
of
gordias
king
of
phrygia
who
dedicated
for
an
offering
the
royal
throne
on
which
he
sat
before
all
to
decide
causes
and
this
throne
a
sight
worth
seeing
stands
in
the
same
place
with
the
bowls
of
gyges
this
gold
and
silver
which
gyges
dedicated
is
called
gygian
by
the
people
of
delphi
after
the
name
of
him
who
offered
it
now
gyges
also
as
soon
as
he
became
king
led
an
army
against
miletos
and
smyrna
and
he
took
the
lower
town
of
colophon
but
no
other
great
deed
did
he
do
in
his
reign
which
lasted
years
therefore
we
will
pass
him
by
with
no
more
mention
than
has
already
been
made
and
i
will
speak
now
of
ardys
the
son
of
gyges
who
became
king
after
gyges
he
took
priene
and
made
an
invasion
against
miletos
and
while
he
was
ruling
over
sardis
the
kimmerians
driven
from
their
abodes
by
the
nomad
scythians
came
to
asia
and
took
sardis
except
the
citadel
now
when
ardys
had
been
king
for
years
sadyattes
his
son
succeeded
to
his
kingdom
and
reigned
twelve
years
and
after
him
alyattes
this
last
made
war
against
kyaxares
the
descendant
of
deïokes
and
against
the
medes
and
he
drove
the
kimmerians
forth
out
of
asia
and
he
took
smyrna
which
had
been
founded
from
colophon
and
made
an
invasion
against
clazomenai
from
this
he
ed
not
as
he
desired
but
with
great
loss
during
his
reign
however
he
performed
other
deeds
very
worthy
of
mention
as
follows
he
made
war
with
those
of
miletos
having
received
this
war
as
an
inheritance
from
his
father
for
he
used
to
invade
their
land
and
besiege
miletos
in
the
following
manner
there
were
ripe
crops
upon
the
land
then
he
led
an
army
into
their
confines
making
his
march
to
the
sound
of
pipes
and
harps
and
flutes
both
of
male
and
female
tone
and
when
he
came
to
the
milesian
land
he
neither
pulled
down
the
houses
that
were
in
the
fields
nor
set
fire
to
them
nor
tore
off
their
doors
but
let
them
stand
as
they
were
the
trees
however
and
the
crops
that
were
upon
the
land
he
destroyed
and
then
departed
by
the
way
he
came
for
the
men
of
miletos
had
command
of
the
sea
so
that
it
was
of
no
use
for
his
army
to
blockade
them
and
he
abstained
from
pulling
down
the
houses
to
the
end
that
the
milesians
might
have
places
to
dwell
in
while
they
sowed
and
tilled
the
land
and
by
the
means
of
their
labour
he
might
have
somewhat
to
destroy
when
he
made
his
invasion
thus
he
continued
to
war
with
them
for
eleven
years
and
in
the
course
of
these
years
the
milesians
suffered
two
great
defeats
once
when
they
fought
a
battle
in
the
district
of
limenion
in
their
own
land
and
again
in
the
plain
of
maiander
now
for
six
of
the
eleven
years
sadyattes
the
son
of
ardys
was
still
ruler
of
the
lydians
the
same
who
was
wont
to
invade
the
land
of
miletos
at
the
times
mentioned
for
this
sadyattes
was
he
who
first
began
the
war
but
for
the
five
years
which
followed
these
first
six
the
war
was
carried
on
by
alyattes
the
son
of
sadyattes
who
received
it
as
an
inheritance
from
his
father
as
i
have
already
said
and
applied
himself
to
it
earnestly
and
none
of
the
ionians
helped
those
of
miletos
bear
the
burden
of
this
war
except
only
the
men
of
chios
these
came
to
their
aid
to
pay
back
like
with
like
for
the
milesians
had
formerly
assisted
the
chians
throughout
their
war
with
the
people
of
erythrai
then
in
the
twelfth
year
of
the
war
when
standing
corn
was
being
burnt
by
the
army
of
the
lydians
it
happened
as
follows
soon
as
the
corn
was
kindled
it
was
driven
by
a
violent
wind
and
set
fire
to
the
temple
of
athene
surnamed
of
assessos
and
the
temple
being
set
on
fire
was
burnt
down
to
the
ground
of
this
no
account
was
made
then
but
afterwards
when
the
army
had
ed
to
sardis
alyattes
fell
sick
and
as
his
sickness
lasted
long
he
sent
messengers
to
inquire
of
the
oracle
at
delphi
either
being
advised
to
do
so
by
some
one
or
because
he
himself
thought
it
best
to
send
and
inquire
of
the
god
concerning
his
sickness
but
when
these
arrived
at
delphi
the
pythian
prophetess
said
that
she
would
give
them
no
answer
until
they
should
have
built
up
again
the
temple
of
athene
which
they
had
burnt
at
assessos
in
the
land
of
miletos
thus
much
i
know
by
the
report
of
the
people
of
delphi
but
the
milesians
add
to
this
that
periander
the
son
of
kypselos
being
a
special
of
thrasybulos
the
then
despot
of
miletos
heard
of
the
oracle
which
had
been
given
to
alyattes
and
sending
a
messenger
told
thrasybulos
in
order
that
he
might
have
knowledge
of
it
beforehand
and
take
such
counsel
as
the
case
required
this
is
the
story
told
by
the
milesians
and
alyattes
when
this
answer
was
reported
to
him
sent
a
herald
forthwith
to
miletos
desiring
to
make
a
truce
with
thrasybulos
and
the
milesians
for
so
long
a
time
as
he
should
be
building
the
temple
he
then
was
being
sent
as
envoy
to
miletos
and
thrasybulos
in
the
meantime
being
informed
beforehand
of
the
whole
matter
and
knowing
what
alyattes
was
meaning
to
do
contrived
this
device
gathered
together
in
the
all
the
store
of
provisions
which
was
found
in
the
city
both
his
own
and
that
which
belonged
to
private
persons
and
he
proclaimed
to
the
milesians
that
on
a
signal
given
by
him
they
should
all
begin
to
drink
and
make
merry
with
one
another
this
thrasybulos
did
and
thus
proclaimed
to
the
end
that
the
herald
from
sardis
seeing
a
vast
quantity
of
provisions
carelessly
piled
up
and
the
people
feasting
might
report
this
to
alyattes
and
so
on
fact
it
happened
for
when
the
herald
ed
to
sardis
after
seeing
this
and
delivering
to
thrasybulos
the
charge
which
was
given
to
him
by
the
king
of
lydia
the
peace
which
was
made
came
about
as
i
am
informed
merely
because
of
this
for
alyattes
who
thought
that
there
was
a
great
famine
in
miletos
and
that
the
people
had
been
worn
down
to
the
extreme
of
misery
heard
from
the
herald
when
he
ed
from
miletos
the
opposite
to
that
which
he
himself
supposed
and
after
this
the
peace
was
made
between
them
on
condition
of
being
and
allies
to
one
another
and
alyattes
built
two
temples
to
athene
at
assessos
in
place
of
one
and
himself
recovered
from
his
sickness
with
regard
then
to
the
war
waged
by
alyattes
with
the
milesians
and
thrasybulos
things
went
thus
as
for
periander
the
man
who
gave
information
about
the
oracle
to
thrasybulos
he
was
the
son
of
kypselos
and
despot
of
corinth
in
his
life
say
the
corinthians
and
with
them
agree
the
lesbians
there
happened
to
him
a
very
great
marvel
namely
that
arion
of
methymna
was
carried
ashore
at
tainaron
upon
a
dolphin
back
this
man
was
a
harper
second
to
none
of
those
who
then
lived
and
the
first
so
far
as
we
know
who
composed
a
dithyramb
naming
it
so
and
teaching
it
to
a
chorus
at
corinth
this
arion
they
say
who
for
the
most
part
of
his
time
stayed
with
periander
conceived
a
desire
to
sail
to
italy
and
sicily
and
after
he
had
there
acquired
large
sums
of
money
he
wished
to
again
to
corinth
he
set
forth
therefore
from
taras
and
as
he
had
faith
in
corinthians
more
than
in
other
men
he
hired
a
ship
with
a
crew
of
corinthians
these
the
story
says
when
out
in
open
sea
formed
a
plot
to
cast
arion
overboard
and
so
possess
his
wealth
and
he
having
obtained
knowledge
of
this
made
entreaties
to
them
offering
them
his
wealth
and
asking
them
to
grant
him
his
life
with
this
however
he
did
not
prevail
upon
them
but
the
men
who
were
conveying
him
bade
him
either
slay
himself
there
that
he
might
receive
burial
on
the
land
or
leap
straightway
into
the
sea
so
arion
being
driven
to
a
strait
entreated
them
that
since
they
were
so
minded
they
would
allow
him
to
take
his
stand
in
full
minstrel
garb
upon
the
deck
of
the
ship
and
sing
and
he
promised
to
put
himself
to
death
after
he
had
sung
they
then
well
pleased
to
think
that
they
should
hear
the
best
of
all
minstrels
upon
earth
drew
back
from
the
stern
towards
the
middle
of
the
ship
and
he
put
on
the
full
minstrel
garb
and
took
his
lyre
and
standing
on
the
deck
performed
the
orthian
measure
then
as
the
measure
ended
he
threw
himself
into
the
sea
just
as
he
was
in
his
full
minstrel
garb
and
they
went
on
sailing
away
to
corinth
but
him
they
say
a
dolphin
supported
on
its
back
and
brought
him
to
shore
at
tainaron
and
when
he
had
come
to
land
he
proceeded
to
corinth
with
his
minstrel
garb
thither
having
arrived
he
related
all
that
had
been
done
and
periander
doubting
of
his
story
kept
arion
in
guard
and
would
let
him
go
nowhere
while
he
kept
careful
watch
for
those
who
had
conveyed
him
when
these
came
he
called
them
and
inquired
of
them
if
they
had
any
report
to
make
of
arion
and
when
they
said
that
he
was
safe
in
italy
and
that
they
had
left
him
at
taras
faring
well
arion
suddenly
appeared
before
them
in
the
same
guise
as
when
he
made
his
leap
from
the
ship
and
they
being
struck
with
amazement
were
no
longer
able
to
deny
when
they
were
questioned
this
is
the
tale
told
by
the
corinthians
and
lesbians
alike
and
there
is
at
tainaron
a
votive
offering
of
arion
of
no
great
size
namely
a
bronze
figure
of
a
man
upon
a
dolphin
back
alyattes
the
lydian
when
he
had
thus
waged
war
against
the
milesians
afterwards
died
having
reigned
years
this
king
when
he
recovered
from
his
sickness
dedicated
a
votive
offering
at
delphi
being
the
second
of
his
house
who
had
so
done
namely
a
great
of
silver
with
a
stand
for
it
of
iron
welded
together
which
last
is
a
sight
worth
seeing
above
all
the
offerings
at
delphi
and
the
work
of
glaucos
the
chian
who
of
all
men
first
found
out
the
art
of
welding
iron
after
alyattes
was
dead
croesus
the
son
of
alyattes
received
the
kingdom
in
succession
being
years
of
age
he
as
i
said
fought
against
the
hellenes
and
of
them
he
attacked
the
ephesians
first
the
ephesians
then
being
besieged
by
him
dedicated
their
city
to
artemis
and
tied
a
rope
from
the
temple
to
the
wall
of
the
city
now
the
distance
between
the
ancient
city
which
was
then
being
besieged
and
the
temple
is
seven
furlongs
these
i
say
where
the
first
upon
whom
croesus
laid
hands
but
afterwards
he
did
the
same
to
the
other
ionian
and
aiolian
cities
one
by
one
alleging
against
them
various
causes
of
complaint
and
making
serious
charges
against
those
in
whose
cases
he
could
find
serious
grounds
while
against
others
of
them
he
charged
merely
trifling
offences
then
when
the
hellenes
in
asia
had
been
conquered
and
forced
to
pay
tribute
he
designed
next
to
build
for
himself
ships
and
to
lay
hands
upon
those
who
dwelt
in
the
islands
and
when
all
was
prepared
for
his
building
of
ships
they
say
that
bias
of
priene
or
according
to
another
account
pittacos
of
mytilene
came
to
sardis
and
being
asked
by
croesus
whether
there
was
any
new
thing
doing
in
hellas
brought
to
an
end
his
building
of
ships
by
this
saying
o
king
said
he
the
men
of
the
islands
are
hiring
a
troop
of
ten
thousand
horse
and
with
this
they
mean
to
march
to
sardis
and
fight
against
thee
and
croesus
supposing
that
what
he
reported
was
true
said
may
the
gods
put
it
into
the
minds
of
the
dwellers
of
the
islands
to
come
with
horses
against
the
sons
of
the
lydians
and
he
answered
and
said
o
king
i
perceive
that
thou
dost
earnestly
desire
to
catch
the
men
of
the
islands
on
the
mainland
riding
upon
horses
and
it
is
not
unreasonable
that
thou
shouldest
wish
for
this
what
else
however
thinkest
thou
the
men
of
the
islands
desire
and
have
been
praying
for
ever
since
the
time
they
heard
that
thou
wert
about
to
build
ships
against
them
than
that
they
might
catch
the
lydians
upon
the
sea
so
as
to
take
vengeance
upon
thee
for
the
hellenes
who
dwell
upon
the
mainland
whom
thou
dost
hold
enslaved
croesus
they
say
was
greatly
pleased
with
this
conclusion
and
obeying
his
suggestion
for
he
judged
him
to
speak
suitably
he
stopped
his
building
of
ships
and
upon
that
he
formed
a
friendship
with
the
ionians
dwelling
in
the
islands
as
time
went
on
when
nearly
all
those
dwelling
on
this
side
the
river
halys
had
been
subdued
for
except
the
kilikians
and
lykians
croesus
subdued
and
kept
under
his
rule
all
the
nations
that
is
to
say
lydians
phrygians
mysians
mariandynoi
chalybians
paphlagonians
thracians
both
thynian
and
bithynian
carians
ionians
dorians
aiolians
and
pamphylians
when
these
i
say
had
been
subdued
and
while
he
was
still
adding
to
his
lydian
dominions
there
came
to
sardis
then
at
the
height
of
its
wealth
all
the
wise
men
of
the
hellas
who
chanced
to
be
alive
at
that
time
brought
thither
severally
by
various
occasions
and
of
them
one
was
solon
the
athenian
who
after
he
had
made
laws
for
the
athenians
at
their
bidding
left
his
native
country
for
ten
years
and
sailed
away
saying
that
he
desired
to
visit
various
lands
in
order
that
he
might
not
be
compelled
to
repeal
any
of
the
laws
which
he
had
proposed
for
of
themselves
the
athenians
were
not
competent
to
do
this
having
bound
themselves
by
solemn
oaths
to
submit
for
ten
years
to
the
laws
which
solon
should
propose
for
them
so
solon
having
left
his
native
country
for
this
reason
and
for
the
sake
of
seeing
various
lands
came
to
amasis
in
egypt
and
also
to
croesus
at
sardis
having
there
arrived
he
was
entertained
as
a
guest
by
croesus
in
the
king
palace
and
afterwards
on
the
third
or
fourth
day
at
the
bidding
of
croesus
his
servants
led
solon
round
to
see
his
treasuries
and
they
showed
him
all
things
how
great
and
magnificent
they
were
and
after
he
had
looked
upon
them
all
and
examined
them
as
he
had
occasion
croesus
asked
him
as
follows
athenian
guest
much
report
of
thee
has
come
to
us
both
in
regard
to
thy
wisdom
and
thy
wanderings
how
that
in
thy
search
for
wisdom
thou
hast
traversed
many
lands
to
see
them
now
therefore
a
desire
has
come
upon
me
to
ask
thee
whether
thou
hast
seen
any
whom
thou
deemest
to
be
of
all
men
the
most
happy
this
he
asked
supposing
that
he
himself
was
the
happiest
of
men
but
solon
using
no
flattery
but
the
truth
only
said
yes
o
king
tellos
the
athenian
and
croesus
marvelling
at
that
which
he
said
asked
him
earnestly
in
what
respect
dost
thou
judge
tellos
to
be
the
most
happy
and
he
said
tellos
in
the
first
place
living
while
his
native
state
was
prosperous
had
sons
fair
and
good
and
saw
from
all
of
them
children
begotten
and
living
to
grow
up
and
secondly
he
had
what
with
us
is
accounted
wealth
and
after
his
life
a
most
glorious
end
for
when
a
battle
was
fought
by
the
athenians
at
eleusis
against
the
neighbouring
people
he
brought
up
supports
and
routed
the
foe
and
there
died
by
a
most
fair
death
and
the
athenians
buried
him
publicly
where
he
fell
and
honoured
him
greatly
so
when
solon
had
moved
croesus
to
inquire
further
by
the
story
of
tellos
recounting
how
many
points
of
happiness
he
had
the
king
asked
again
whom
he
had
seen
proper
to
be
placed
next
after
this
man
supposing
that
he
himself
would
certainly
obtain
at
least
the
second
place
but
he
replied
cleobis
and
biton
for
these
who
were
of
argos
by
race
possessed
a
sufficiency
of
wealth
and
in
addition
to
this
strength
of
body
such
as
i
shall
tell
both
equally
had
won
prizes
in
the
games
and
moreover
the
following
tale
is
told
of
them
was
a
feast
of
hera
among
the
argives
and
it
was
by
all
means
necessary
that
their
mother
should
be
borne
in
a
car
to
the
temple
but
since
their
oxen
were
not
brought
up
in
time
from
the
field
the
young
men
barred
from
all
else
by
lack
of
time
submitted
themselves
to
the
yoke
and
drew
the
wain
their
mother
being
borne
by
them
upon
it
and
so
they
brought
it
on
for
furlongs
and
came
to
the
temple
then
after
they
had
done
this
and
had
been
seen
by
the
assembled
crowd
there
came
to
their
life
a
most
excellent
ending
and
in
this
the
deity
declared
that
it
was
better
for
man
to
die
than
to
continue
to
live
for
the
argive
men
were
standing
round
and
extolling
the
strength
of
the
young
men
while
the
argive
women
were
extolling
the
mother
to
whose
lot
it
had
fallen
to
have
such
sons
and
the
mother
being
exceedingly
rejoiced
both
by
the
deed
itself
and
by
the
report
made
of
it
took
her
stand
in
front
of
the
image
of
the
goddess
and
prayed
that
she
would
give
to
cleobis
and
biton
her
sons
who
had
honoured
her
greatly
that
gift
which
is
best
for
man
to
receive
and
after
this
prayer
when
they
had
sacrificed
and
feasted
the
young
men
lay
down
to
sleep
within
the
temple
itself
and
never
rose
again
but
were
held
bound
in
this
last
end
and
the
argives
made
statues
in
the
likeness
of
them
and
dedicated
them
as
offerings
at
delphi
thinking
that
they
had
proved
themselves
most
excellent
thus
solon
assigned
the
second
place
in
respect
of
happiness
to
these
and
croesus
was
moved
to
anger
and
said
athenian
guest
hast
thou
then
so
cast
aside
our
prosperous
state
as
worth
nothing
that
thou
dost
prefer
to
us
even
men
of
private
station
and
he
said
croesus
thou
art
inquiring
about
human
fortunes
of
one
who
well
knows
that
the
deity
is
altogether
envious
and
apt
to
disturb
our
lot
for
in
the
course
of
long
time
a
man
may
see
many
things
which
he
would
not
desire
to
see
and
suffer
also
many
things
which
he
would
not
desire
to
suffer
the
limit
of
life
for
a
man
i
lay
down
at
seventy
years
and
these
seventy
years
give
thousand
and
two
hundred
days
not
reckoning
for
any
intercalated
month
then
if
every
other
one
of
these
years
shall
be
made
longer
by
one
month
that
the
seasons
may
be
caused
to
come
round
at
the
due
time
of
the
year
the
intercalated
months
will
be
in
number
besides
the
seventy
years
and
of
these
months
the
days
will
be
one
thousand
and
fifty
of
all
these
days
being
in
number
thousand
two
hundred
and
fifty
which
go
to
the
seventy
years
one
day
produces
nothing
at
all
which
resembles
what
another
brings
with
it
thus
then
o
croesus
man
is
altogether
a
creature
of
accident
as
for
thee
i
perceive
that
thou
art
both
great
in
wealth
and
king
of
many
men
but
that
of
which
thou
didst
ask
me
i
can
not
call
thee
yet
until
i
learn
that
thou
hast
brought
thy
life
to
a
fair
ending
for
the
very
rich
man
is
not
at
all
to
be
accounted
more
happy
than
he
who
has
but
his
subsistence
from
day
to
day
unless
also
the
fortune
go
with
him
of
ending
his
life
well
in
possession
of
all
things
fair
for
many
very
wealthy
men
are
not
happy
while
many
who
have
but
a
moderate
living
are
fortunate
and
in
truth
the
very
rich
man
who
is
not
happy
has
two
advantages
only
as
compared
with
the
poor
man
who
is
fortunate
whereas
this
latter
has
many
as
compared
with
the
rich
man
who
is
not
happy
the
rich
man
is
able
better
to
fulfil
his
desire
and
also
to
endure
a
great
calamity
if
it
fall
upon
him
whereas
the
other
has
advantage
over
him
in
these
things
which
follow
is
not
indeed
able
equally
with
the
rich
man
to
endure
a
calamity
or
to
fulfil
his
desire
but
these
his
good
fortune
keeps
away
from
him
while
he
is
sound
of
limb
free
from
disease
untouched
by
suffering
the
father
of
fair
children
and
himself
of
comely
form
and
if
in
addition
to
this
he
shall
end
his
life
well
he
is
worthy
to
be
called
that
which
thou
seekest
namely
a
happy
man
but
before
he
comes
to
his
end
it
is
well
to
hold
back
and
not
to
call
him
yet
happy
but
only
fortunate
now
to
possess
all
these
things
together
is
impossible
for
one
who
is
mere
man
just
as
no
single
land
suffices
to
supply
all
things
for
itself
but
one
thing
it
has
and
another
it
lacks
and
the
land
that
has
the
greatest
number
of
things
is
the
best
so
also
in
the
case
of
a
man
no
single
person
is
complete
in
himself
for
one
thing
he
has
and
another
he
lacks
but
whosoever
of
men
continues
to
the
end
in
possession
of
the
greatest
number
of
these
things
and
then
has
a
gracious
ending
of
his
life
he
is
by
me
accounted
worthy
o
king
to
receive
this
name
but
we
must
of
every
thing
examine
the
end
and
how
it
will
turn
out
at
the
last
for
to
many
god
shows
but
a
glimpse
of
happiness
and
then
plucks
them
up
by
the
roots
and
overturns
them
thus
saying
he
refused
to
gratify
croesus
who
sent
him
away
from
his
presence
holding
him
in
no
esteem
and
thinking
him
utterly
senseless
in
that
he
passed
over
present
good
things
and
bade
men
look
to
the
end
of
every
matter
after
solon
had
departed
a
great
retribution
from
god
came
upon
croesus
probably
because
he
judged
himself
to
be
the
happiest
of
all
men
first
there
came
and
stood
by
him
a
dream
which
showed
to
him
the
truth
of
the
evils
that
were
about
to
come
to
pass
in
respect
of
his
son
now
croesus
had
two
sons
of
whom
one
was
deficient
seeing
that
he
was
deaf
and
dumb
while
the
other
far
surpassed
his
companions
of
the
same
age
in
all
things
and
the
name
of
this
last
was
atys
as
regards
this
atys
then
the
dream
signified
to
croesus
that
he
should
lose
him
by
the
blow
of
an
iron
and
when
he
rose
up
from
sleep
and
considered
the
matter
with
himself
he
was
struck
with
fear
on
account
of
the
dream
and
first
he
took
for
his
son
a
wife
and
whereas
his
son
had
been
wont
to
lead
the
armies
of
the
lydians
he
now
no
longer
sent
him
forth
anywhere
on
any
such
business
and
the
javelins
and
lances
and
all
such
things
which
men
use
for
fighting
he
conveyed
out
of
the
men
apartments
and
piled
them
up
in
the
inner
for
fear
lest
something
hanging
up
might
fall
down
upon
his
son
then
while
he
was
engaged
about
the
marriage
of
his
son
there
came
to
sardis
a
man
under
a
misfortune
and
with
hands
not
clean
a
phrygian
by
birth
and
of
the
royal
house
this
man
came
to
the
house
of
croesus
and
according
to
the
customs
which
prevail
in
that
land
made
request
that
he
might
have
cleansing
and
croesus
gave
him
cleansing
now
the
manner
of
cleansing
among
the
lydians
is
the
same
almost
as
that
which
the
hellenes
use
so
when
croesus
had
done
that
which
was
customary
he
asked
of
him
whence
he
came
and
who
he
was
saying
as
follows
man
who
art
thou
and
from
what
region
of
phrygia
didst
thou
come
to
sit
upon
my
hearth
and
whom
of
men
or
women
didst
thou
slay
and
he
replied
o
king
i
am
the
son
of
gordias
the
son
of
midas
and
i
am
called
adrastos
and
i
slew
my
own
brother
against
my
will
and
therefore
am
i
here
having
been
driven
forth
by
my
father
and
deprived
of
all
that
i
had
and
croesus
answered
thus
thou
art
as
it
chances
the
offshoot
of
men
who
are
our
friends
and
thou
hast
come
to
friends
among
whom
thou
shalt
want
of
nothing
so
long
as
thou
shalt
remain
in
our
land
and
thou
wilt
find
it
most
for
thy
profit
to
bear
this
misfortune
as
lightly
as
may
be
so
he
had
his
abode
with
croesus
during
this
time
there
was
produced
in
the
mysian
olympos
a
boar
of
monstrous
size
this
coming
down
from
the
mountain
aforesaid
ravaged
the
fields
of
the
mysians
and
although
the
mysians
went
out
against
it
often
yet
they
could
do
it
no
hurt
but
rather
received
hurt
themselves
from
it
so
at
length
messengers
came
from
the
mysians
to
croesus
and
said
o
king
there
has
appeared
in
our
land
a
boar
of
monstrous
size
which
lays
waste
our
fields
and
we
desiring
eagerly
to
take
it
are
not
able
now
therefore
we
ask
of
thee
to
send
with
us
thy
son
and
also
a
chosen
band
of
young
men
with
dogs
that
we
may
destroy
it
out
of
our
land
thus
they
made
request
and
croesus
calling
to
mind
the
words
of
the
dream
spoke
to
them
as
follows
as
touching
my
son
make
no
further
mention
of
him
in
this
matter
for
i
will
not
send
him
with
you
seeing
that
he
is
newly
married
and
is
concerned
now
with
the
affairs
of
his
marriage
but
i
will
send
with
you
chosen
men
of
the
lydians
and
the
whole
number
of
my
hunting
dogs
and
i
will
give
command
to
those
who
go
to
be
as
zealous
as
may
be
in
helping
you
to
destroy
the
wild
beast
out
of
your
land
thus
he
made
reply
and
while
the
mysians
were
being
contented
with
this
answer
there
came
in
also
the
son
of
croesus
having
heard
of
the
request
made
by
the
mysians
and
when
croesus
said
that
he
would
not
send
his
son
with
them
the
young
man
spoke
as
follows
my
father
in
times
past
the
fairest
and
most
noble
part
was
allotted
to
us
to
go
out
continually
to
wars
and
to
the
chase
and
so
have
good
repute
but
now
thou
hast
debarred
me
from
both
of
these
although
thou
hast
not
observed
in
me
any
cowardly
or
spirit
and
now
with
what
face
must
i
appear
when
i
go
to
and
from
the
of
the
city
what
kind
of
a
man
shall
i
be
esteemed
by
the
citizens
and
what
kind
of
a
man
shall
i
be
esteemed
by
my
wife
with
what
kind
of
a
husband
will
she
think
that
she
is
mated
therefore
either
let
me
go
to
the
hunt
or
persuade
me
by
reason
that
these
things
are
better
for
me
done
as
now
they
are
and
croesus
made
answer
thus
my
son
not
because
i
have
observed
in
thee
any
spirit
of
cowardice
or
any
other
ungracious
thing
do
i
act
thus
but
a
vision
of
a
dream
came
and
stood
by
me
in
my
sleep
and
told
me
that
thou
shouldest
be
and
that
thou
shouldest
perish
by
a
of
iron
with
thought
of
this
vision
therefore
i
both
urged
on
this
marriage
for
thee
and
i
refuse
now
to
send
thee
upon
the
matter
which
is
being
taken
in
hand
having
a
care
of
thee
that
i
may
steal
thee
from
thy
fate
at
least
for
the
period
of
my
own
life
if
by
any
means
possible
for
me
to
do
so
for
thou
art
as
it
chances
my
only
son
the
other
i
do
not
reckon
as
one
seeing
that
he
is
deficient
in
hearing
the
young
man
made
answer
thus
it
may
well
be
forgiven
in
thee
o
my
father
that
thou
shouldest
have
a
care
of
me
after
having
seen
such
a
vision
but
that
which
thou
dost
not
understand
and
in
which
the
meaning
of
the
dream
has
escaped
thee
it
is
right
that
i
should
expound
to
thee
thou
sayest
the
dream
declared
that
i
should
end
my
life
by
means
of
a
of
iron
but
what
hands
has
a
boar
or
what
of
iron
of
which
thou
art
afraid
if
the
dream
had
told
thee
that
i
should
end
my
life
by
a
tusk
or
any
other
thing
which
resembles
that
it
would
be
right
for
thee
doubtless
to
do
as
thou
art
doing
but
it
said
a
since
therefore
our
fight
will
not
be
with
men
let
me
now
go
croesus
made
answer
my
son
thou
dost
partly
prevail
with
me
by
declaring
thy
judgment
about
the
dream
therefore
having
been
prevailed
upon
by
thee
i
change
my
resolution
and
allow
thee
to
go
to
the
chase
having
thus
said
croesus
went
to
summon
adrastos
the
phrygian
and
when
he
came
he
addressed
him
thus
adrastos
when
thou
wast
struck
with
a
grievous
misfortune
with
which
i
reproach
thee
not
i
cleansed
thee
and
i
have
received
thee
into
my
house
supplying
all
thy
costs
now
therefore
since
having
first
received
kindness
from
me
thou
art
bound
to
requite
me
with
kindness
i
ask
of
thee
to
be
the
protector
of
my
son
who
goes
forth
to
the
chase
lest
any
evil
robbers
come
upon
you
by
the
way
to
do
you
harm
and
besides
this
thou
too
oughtest
to
go
where
thou
mayest
become
famous
by
thy
deeds
for
it
belongs
to
thee
as
an
inheritance
from
thy
fathers
so
to
do
and
moreover
thou
hast
strength
for
it
adrastos
made
answer
o
king
but
for
this
i
should
not
have
been
going
to
any
such
contest
of
valour
for
first
it
is
not
fitting
that
one
who
is
suffering
such
a
great
misfortune
as
mine
should
seek
the
company
of
his
fellows
who
are
in
prosperity
and
secondly
i
have
no
desire
for
it
and
for
many
reasons
i
should
have
kept
myself
away
but
now
since
thou
art
urgent
with
me
and
i
ought
to
gratify
thee
for
i
am
bound
to
requite
thee
with
kindness
i
am
ready
to
do
this
expect
therefore
that
thy
son
whom
thou
commandest
me
to
protect
will
home
to
thee
unhurt
so
far
as
his
protector
may
avail
to
keep
him
safe
when
he
had
made
answer
to
croesus
in
words
like
these
they
afterwards
set
forth
provided
with
chosen
young
men
and
with
dogs
and
when
they
were
come
to
mount
olympos
they
tracked
the
animal
and
having
found
it
and
taken
their
stand
round
in
a
circle
they
were
hurling
against
it
their
spears
then
the
guest
he
who
had
been
cleansed
of
manslaughter
whose
name
was
adrastos
hurling
a
spear
at
it
missed
the
boar
and
struck
the
son
of
croesus
so
he
being
struck
by
the
fulfilled
the
saying
of
the
dream
and
one
ran
to
report
to
croesus
that
which
had
come
to
pass
and
having
come
to
sardis
he
signified
to
him
of
the
combat
and
of
the
fate
of
his
son
and
croesus
was
very
greatly
disturbed
by
the
death
of
his
son
and
was
much
the
more
moved
to
complaining
by
this
namely
that
his
son
was
slain
by
the
man
whom
he
had
himself
cleansed
of
manslaughter
and
being
grievously
troubled
by
the
misfortune
he
called
upon
zeus
the
cleanser
protesting
to
him
that
which
he
had
suffered
from
his
guest
and
he
called
moreover
upon
the
protector
of
suppliants
and
the
guardian
of
friendship
naming
still
the
same
god
and
calling
upon
him
as
the
protector
of
suppliants
because
when
he
received
the
guest
into
his
house
he
had
been
fostering
ignorantly
the
slayer
of
his
son
and
as
the
guardian
of
friendship
because
having
sent
him
as
a
protector
he
had
found
him
the
worst
of
foes
after
this
the
lydians
came
bearing
the
corpse
and
behind
it
followed
the
slayer
and
he
taking
his
stand
before
the
corpse
delivered
himself
up
to
croesus
holding
forth
his
hands
and
bidding
the
king
slay
him
over
the
corpse
speaking
of
his
former
misfortune
and
saying
that
in
addition
to
this
he
had
now
been
the
destroyer
of
the
man
who
had
cleansed
him
of
it
and
that
life
for
him
was
no
more
worth
living
but
croesus
hearing
this
pitied
adrastos
although
he
was
himself
suffering
so
great
an
evil
of
his
own
and
said
to
him
guest
i
have
already
received
from
thee
all
the
satisfaction
that
is
due
seeing
that
thou
dost
condemn
thyself
to
suffer
death
and
not
thou
alone
art
the
cause
of
this
evil
except
in
so
far
as
thou
wert
the
instrument
of
it
against
thine
own
will
but
some
one
as
i
suppose
of
the
gods
who
also
long
ago
signified
to
me
that
which
was
about
to
be
so
croesus
buried
his
son
as
was
fitting
but
adrastos
the
son
of
gordias
the
son
of
midas
he
who
had
been
the
slayer
of
his
own
brother
and
the
slayer
also
of
the
man
who
had
cleansed
him
when
silence
came
of
all
men
round
about
the
tomb
recognising
that
he
was
more
grievously
burdened
by
misfortune
than
all
men
of
whom
he
knew
slew
himself
upon
the
grave
for
two
years
then
croesus
remained
quiet
in
his
mourning
because
he
was
deprived
of
his
son
but
after
this
period
of
time
the
overthrowing
of
the
rule
of
astyages
the
son
of
kyaxares
by
cyrus
the
son
of
cambyses
and
the
growing
greatness
of
the
persians
caused
croesus
to
cease
from
his
mourning
and
led
him
to
a
care
of
cutting
short
the
power
of
the
persians
if
by
any
means
he
might
while
yet
it
was
in
growth
and
before
they
should
have
become
great
so
having
formed
this
design
he
began
forthwith
to
make
trial
of
the
oracles
both
those
of
the
hellenes
and
that
in
libya
sending
messengers
some
to
one
place
and
some
to
another
some
to
go
to
delphi
others
to
abai
of
the
phokians
and
others
to
dodona
and
some
were
sent
to
the
shrine
of
amphiaraos
and
to
that
of
trophonios
others
to
branchidai
in
the
land
of
miletos
these
are
the
oracles
of
the
hellenes
to
which
croesus
sent
messengers
to
seek
divination
and
others
he
sent
to
the
shrine
of
ammon
in
libya
to
inquire
there
now
he
was
sending
the
messengers
abroad
to
the
end
that
he
might
try
the
oracles
and
find
out
what
knowledge
they
had
so
that
if
they
should
be
found
to
have
knowledge
of
the
truth
he
might
send
and
ask
them
secondly
whether
he
should
attempt
to
march
against
the
persians
and
to
the
lydians
whom
he
sent
to
make
trial
of
the
oracles
he
gave
charge
as
follows
from
the
day
on
which
they
set
out
from
sardis
they
should
reckon
up
the
number
of
the
days
following
and
on
the
hundredth
day
they
should
consult
the
oracles
asking
what
croesus
the
son
of
alyattes
king
of
the
lydians
chanced
then
to
be
doing
and
whatever
the
oracles
severally
should
prophesy
this
they
should
cause
to
be
written
down
and
bear
it
back
to
him
now
what
the
other
oracles
prophesied
is
not
by
any
reported
but
at
delphi
so
soon
as
the
lydians
entered
the
sanctuary
of
the
temple
to
consult
the
god
and
asked
that
which
they
were
commanded
to
ask
the
pythian
prophetess
spoke
thus
in
hexameter
measure
but
the
number
of
sand
i
know
and
the
measure
of
drops
in
the
ocean
the
dumb
man
i
understand
and
i
hear
the
speech
of
the
speechless
and
there
hath
come
to
my
soul
the
smell
of
a
tortoise
boiling
in
caldron
of
bronze
and
the
flesh
of
a
lamb
mingled
with
it
under
it
bronze
is
laid
it
hath
bronze
as
a
clothing
upon
it
when
the
pythian
prophetess
had
uttered
this
oracle
the
lydians
caused
the
prophecy
to
be
written
down
and
went
away
at
once
to
sardis
and
when
the
rest
also
who
had
been
sent
round
were
there
arrived
with
the
answers
of
the
oracles
then
croesus
unfolded
the
writings
one
by
one
and
looked
upon
them
and
at
first
none
of
them
pleased
him
but
when
he
heard
that
from
delphi
forthwith
he
did
worship
to
the
god
and
accepted
the
answer
judging
that
the
oracle
at
delphi
was
the
only
true
one
because
it
had
found
out
what
he
himself
had
done
for
when
he
had
sent
to
the
several
oracles
his
messengers
to
consult
the
gods
keeping
well
in
mind
the
appointed
day
he
contrived
the
following
device
thought
of
something
which
it
would
be
impossible
to
discover
or
to
conceive
of
and
cutting
up
a
tortoise
and
a
lamb
he
boiled
them
together
himself
in
a
caldron
of
bronze
laying
a
cover
of
bronze
over
them
this
then
was
the
answer
given
to
croesus
from
delphi
and
as
regards
the
answer
of
amphiaraos
i
can
not
tell
what
he
replied
to
the
lydians
after
they
had
done
the
things
customary
in
his
temple
for
there
is
no
record
of
this
any
more
than
of
the
others
except
only
that
croesus
thought
that
he
also
possessed
a
true
oracle
after
this
with
great
sacrifices
he
endeavoured
to
win
the
favour
of
the
god
at
delphi
for
of
all
the
animals
that
are
fit
for
sacrifice
he
offered
three
thousand
of
each
kind
and
he
heaped
up
couches
overlaid
with
gold
and
overlaid
with
silver
and
cups
of
gold
and
robes
of
purple
and
tunics
making
of
them
a
great
pyre
and
this
he
burnt
up
hoping
by
these
means
the
more
to
win
over
the
god
to
the
side
of
the
lydians
and
he
proclaimed
to
all
the
lydians
that
every
one
of
them
should
make
sacrifice
with
that
which
each
man
had
and
when
he
had
finished
the
sacrifice
he
melted
down
a
vast
quantity
of
gold
and
of
it
he
wrought
making
them
six
palms
in
length
and
three
in
breadth
and
in
height
one
palm
and
their
number
was
one
hundred
and
seventeen
of
these
four
were
of
pure
gold
weighing
two
talents
and
a
half
each
and
others
of
gold
alloyed
with
silver
weighing
two
talents
and
he
caused
to
be
made
also
an
image
of
a
lion
of
pure
gold
weighing
ten
talents
which
lion
when
the
temple
of
delphi
was
being
burnt
down
fell
from
off
the
for
upon
these
it
was
set
and
is
placed
now
in
the
treasury
of
the
corinthians
weighing
six
talents
and
a
half
for
three
talents
and
a
half
were
melted
away
from
it
so
croesus
having
finished
all
these
things
sent
them
to
delphi
and
with
them
these
besides
mixing
bowls
of
great
size
one
of
gold
and
the
other
of
silver
of
which
the
golden
bowl
was
placed
on
the
right
hand
as
one
enters
the
temple
and
the
silver
on
the
left
but
the
places
of
these
also
were
changed
after
the
temple
was
burnt
down
and
the
golden
bowl
is
now
placed
in
the
treasury
of
the
people
of
clazomenai
weighing
eight
and
a
half
talents
and
twelve
pounds
over
while
the
silver
one
is
placed
in
the
corner
of
the
vestibule
and
holds
six
hundred
amphors
being
filled
with
wine
by
the
delphians
on
the
feast
of
the
theophania
this
the
people
of
delphi
say
is
the
work
of
theodoros
the
samian
and
as
i
think
rightly
for
it
is
evident
to
me
that
the
workmanship
is
of
no
common
kind
moreover
croesus
sent
four
silver
which
stand
in
the
treasury
of
the
corinthians
and
two
vessels
for
lustral
water
one
of
gold
and
the
other
of
silver
of
which
the
gold
one
is
inscribed
from
the
lacedemonians
who
say
that
it
is
their
offering
therein
however
they
do
not
speak
rightly
for
this
also
is
from
croesus
but
one
of
the
delphians
wrote
the
inscription
upon
it
desiring
to
gratify
the
lacedemonians
and
his
name
i
know
but
will
not
make
mention
of
it
the
boy
through
whose
hand
the
water
flows
is
from
the
lacedemonians
but
neither
of
the
vessels
for
lustral
water
and
many
other
votive
offerings
croesus
sent
with
these
not
specially
distinguished
among
which
are
certain
castings
of
silver
of
a
round
shape
and
also
a
golden
figure
of
a
woman
three
cubits
high
which
the
delphians
say
is
a
statue
of
the
baker
of
croesus
moreover
croesus
dedicated
the
ornaments
from
his
wife
neck
and
her
girdles
these
are
the
things
which
he
sent
to
delphi
and
to
amphiaraos
having
heard
of
his
valour
and
of
his
evil
fate
he
dedicated
a
shield
made
altogether
of
gold
throughout
and
a
spear
all
of
solid
gold
the
shaft
being
of
gold
also
as
well
as
the
two
points
which
offerings
were
both
remaining
even
to
my
time
at
thebes
in
the
temple
of
ismenian
apollo
to
the
lydians
who
were
to
carry
these
gifts
to
the
temples
croesus
gave
charge
that
they
should
ask
the
oracles
this
question
also
croesus
should
march
against
the
persians
and
if
so
whether
he
should
join
with
himself
any
army
of
men
as
his
friends
and
when
the
lydians
had
arrived
at
the
places
to
which
they
had
been
sent
and
had
dedicated
the
votive
offerings
they
inquired
of
the
oracles
and
said
croesus
king
of
the
lydians
and
of
other
nations
considering
that
these
are
the
only
true
oracles
among
men
presents
to
you
gifts
such
as
your
revelations
deserve
and
asks
you
again
now
whether
he
shall
march
against
the
persians
and
if
so
whether
he
shall
join
with
himself
any
army
of
men
as
allies
they
inquired
thus
and
the
answers
of
both
the
oracles
agreed
in
one
declaring
to
croesus
that
if
he
should
march
against
the
persians
he
should
destroy
a
great
empire
and
they
counselled
him
to
find
out
the
most
powerful
of
the
hellenes
and
join
these
with
himself
as
friends
so
when
the
answers
were
brought
back
and
croesus
heard
them
he
was
delighted
with
the
oracles
and
expecting
that
he
would
certainly
destroy
the
kingdom
of
cyrus
he
sent
again
to
pytho
and
presented
to
the
men
of
delphi
having
ascertained
the
number
of
them
two
staters
of
gold
for
each
man
and
in
for
this
the
delphians
gave
to
croesus
and
to
the
lydians
precedence
in
consulting
the
oracle
and
freedom
from
all
payments
and
the
right
to
front
seats
at
the
games
with
this
privilege
also
for
all
time
that
any
one
of
them
who
wished
should
be
allowed
to
become
a
citizen
of
delphi
and
having
made
presents
to
the
men
of
delphi
croesus
consulted
the
oracle
the
third
time
for
from
the
time
when
he
learnt
the
truth
of
the
oracle
he
made
abundant
use
of
it
and
consulting
the
oracle
he
inquired
whether
his
monarchy
would
endure
for
a
long
time
and
the
pythian
prophetess
answered
him
thus
but
when
it
cometh
to
pass
that
a
mule
of
the
medes
shall
be
monarch
then
by
the
pebbly
hermos
o
lydian
flee
and
stay
not
and
be
not
ashamed
to
be
callèd
a
coward
by
these
lines
when
they
came
to
him
croesus
was
pleased
more
than
by
all
the
rest
for
he
supposed
that
a
mule
would
never
be
ruler
of
the
medes
instead
of
a
man
and
accordingly
that
he
himself
and
his
heirs
would
never
cease
from
their
rule
then
after
this
he
gave
thought
to
inquire
which
people
of
the
hellenes
he
should
esteem
the
most
powerful
and
gain
over
to
himself
as
friends
and
inquiring
he
found
that
the
lacedemonians
and
the
athenians
had
the
the
first
of
the
dorian
and
the
others
of
the
ionian
race
for
these
were
the
most
eminent
races
in
ancient
time
the
second
being
a
pelasgian
and
the
first
a
hellenic
race
and
the
one
never
migrated
from
its
place
in
any
direction
while
the
other
was
very
exceedingly
given
to
wanderings
for
in
the
reign
of
deucalion
this
race
dwelt
in
pthiotis
and
in
the
time
of
doros
the
son
of
hellen
in
the
land
lying
below
ossa
and
olympos
which
is
called
histiaiotis
and
when
it
was
driven
from
histiaiotis
by
the
sons
of
cadmos
it
dwelt
in
pindos
and
was
called
makednian
and
thence
it
moved
afterwards
to
dryopis
and
from
dryopis
it
came
finally
to
peloponnesus
and
began
to
be
called
dorian
what
language
however
the
pelasgians
used
to
speak
i
am
not
able
with
certainty
to
say
but
if
one
must
pronounce
judging
by
those
that
still
remain
of
the
pelasgians
who
dwelt
in
the
city
of
creston
above
the
tyrsenians
and
who
were
once
neighbours
of
the
race
now
called
dorian
dwelling
then
in
the
land
which
is
now
called
thessaliotis
and
also
by
those
that
remain
of
the
pelasgians
who
settled
at
plakia
and
skylake
in
the
region
of
the
hellespont
who
before
that
had
been
settlers
with
the
athenians
and
of
the
natives
of
the
various
other
towns
which
are
really
pelasgian
though
they
have
lost
the
name
one
must
pronounce
judging
by
these
the
pelasgians
used
to
speak
a
barbarian
language
if
therefore
all
the
pelasgian
race
was
such
as
these
then
the
attic
race
being
pelasgian
at
the
same
time
when
it
changed
and
became
hellenic
unlearnt
also
its
language
for
the
people
of
creston
do
not
speak
the
same
language
with
any
of
those
who
dwell
about
them
nor
yet
do
the
people
of
phakia
but
they
speak
the
same
language
one
as
the
other
and
by
this
it
is
proved
that
they
still
keep
unchanged
the
form
of
language
which
they
brought
with
them
when
they
migrated
to
these
places
as
for
the
hellenic
race
it
has
used
ever
the
same
language
as
i
clearly
perceive
since
it
first
took
its
rise
but
since
the
time
when
it
parted
off
feeble
at
first
from
the
pelasgian
race
setting
forth
from
a
small
beginning
it
has
increased
to
that
great
number
of
races
which
we
see
and
chiefly
because
many
barbarian
races
have
been
added
to
it
besides
moreover
it
is
true
as
i
think
of
the
pelasgian
race
also
that
so
far
as
it
remained
barbarian
it
never
made
any
great
increase
of
these
races
then
croesus
was
informed
that
the
athenian
was
held
subject
and
torn
with
faction
by
peisistratos
the
son
of
hippocrates
who
then
was
despot
of
the
athenians
for
to
hippocrates
when
as
a
private
citizen
he
went
to
view
the
olympic
games
a
great
marvel
had
occurred
after
he
had
offered
the
sacrifice
the
caldrons
which
were
standing
upon
the
hearth
full
of
pieces
of
flesh
and
of
water
boiled
without
fire
under
them
and
ran
over
and
chilon
the
lacedemonian
who
chanced
to
have
been
present
and
to
have
seen
the
marvel
advised
hippocrates
first
not
to
bring
into
his
house
a
wife
to
bear
him
children
and
secondly
if
he
happened
to
have
one
already
to
dismiss
her
and
if
he
chanced
to
have
a
son
to
disown
him
when
chilon
had
thus
recommended
hippocrates
they
say
was
not
willing
to
be
persuaded
and
so
there
was
born
to
him
afterwards
this
peisistratos
who
when
the
athenians
of
the
shore
were
at
feud
with
those
of
the
plain
megacles
the
son
of
alcmaion
being
leader
of
the
first
faction
and
lycurgos
the
son
of
aristolaïdes
of
that
of
the
plain
aimed
at
the
despotism
for
himself
and
gathered
a
third
party
so
then
after
having
collected
supporters
and
called
himself
leader
of
the
men
of
the
he
contrived
a
device
as
follows
inflicted
wounds
upon
himself
and
upon
his
mules
and
then
drove
his
car
into
the
as
if
he
had
just
escaped
from
his
opponents
who
as
he
alleged
had
desired
to
kill
him
when
he
was
driving
into
the
country
and
he
asked
the
commons
that
he
might
obtain
some
protection
from
them
for
before
this
he
had
gained
reputation
in
his
command
against
the
megarians
during
which
he
took
nisaia
and
performed
other
signal
service
and
the
commons
of
the
athenians
being
deceived
gave
him
those
men
chosen
from
the
dwellers
in
the
city
who
became
not
indeed
the
of
peisistratos
but
his
for
they
followed
behind
him
bearing
wooden
clubs
and
these
made
insurrection
with
peisistratos
and
obtained
possession
of
the
acropolis
then
peisistratos
was
ruler
of
the
athenians
not
having
disturbed
the
existing
magistrates
nor
changed
the
ancient
laws
but
he
administered
the
state
under
that
constitution
of
things
which
was
already
established
ordering
it
fairly
and
well
however
no
long
time
after
this
the
followers
of
megacles
and
those
of
lycurgos
joined
together
and
drove
him
forth
thus
peisistratos
had
obtained
possession
of
athens
for
the
first
time
and
thus
he
lost
the
power
before
he
had
it
firmly
rooted
but
those
who
had
driven
out
peisistratos
became
afterwards
at
feud
with
one
another
again
and
megacles
harassed
by
the
party
strife
sent
a
message
to
peisistratos
asking
whether
he
was
willing
to
have
his
daughter
to
wife
on
condition
of
becoming
despot
and
peisistratos
having
accepted
the
proposal
and
made
an
agreement
on
these
terms
they
contrived
with
a
view
to
his
a
device
the
most
simple
by
far
as
i
think
that
ever
was
practised
considering
at
least
that
it
was
devised
at
a
time
when
the
hellenic
race
had
been
long
marked
off
from
the
barbarian
as
more
skilful
and
further
removed
from
foolish
simplicity
and
among
the
athenians
who
are
accounted
the
first
of
the
hellenes
in
ability
in
the
deme
of
paiania
there
was
a
woman
whose
name
was
phya
in
height
four
cubits
all
but
three
fingers
and
also
fair
of
form
this
woman
they
dressed
in
full
armour
and
caused
her
to
ascend
a
chariot
and
showed
her
the
bearing
in
which
she
might
best
beseem
her
part
and
so
they
drove
to
the
city
having
sent
on
heralds
to
run
before
them
who
when
they
arrived
at
the
city
spoke
that
which
had
been
commanded
them
saying
as
follows
o
athenians
receive
with
favour
peisistratos
whom
athene
herself
honouring
him
most
of
all
men
brings
back
to
her
acropolis
so
the
heralds
went
about
hither
and
thither
saying
this
and
straightway
there
came
to
the
demes
in
the
country
round
a
report
that
athene
was
bringing
peisistratos
back
while
at
the
same
time
the
men
of
the
city
persuaded
that
the
woman
was
the
very
goddess
herself
were
paying
worship
to
the
human
creature
and
receiving
peisistratos
so
having
received
back
the
despotism
in
the
manner
which
has
been
said
peisistratos
according
to
the
agreement
made
with
megacles
married
the
daughter
of
megacles
but
as
he
had
already
sons
who
were
young
men
and
as
the
descendants
of
alcmaion
were
said
to
be
under
a
curse
therefore
not
desiring
that
children
should
be
born
to
him
from
his
wife
he
had
commerce
with
her
not
in
the
accustomed
manner
and
at
first
the
woman
kept
this
secret
but
afterwards
she
told
her
mother
whether
in
answer
to
her
inquiry
or
not
i
can
not
tell
and
the
mother
told
her
husband
megacles
he
then
was
very
indignant
that
he
should
be
dishonoured
by
peisistratos
and
in
his
anger
straightway
he
proceeded
to
compose
his
quarrel
with
the
men
of
his
faction
and
when
peisistratos
heard
of
that
which
was
being
done
against
himself
he
departed
wholly
from
the
land
and
came
to
eretria
where
he
took
counsel
together
with
his
sons
and
the
advice
of
hippias
having
prevailed
that
they
should
endeavour
to
win
back
the
despotism
they
began
to
gather
gifts
of
money
from
those
states
which
owed
them
obligations
for
favours
received
and
many
contributed
great
sums
but
the
thebans
surpassed
the
rest
in
the
giving
of
money
then
not
to
make
the
story
long
time
elapsed
and
at
last
everything
was
prepared
for
their
for
certain
argives
came
as
mercenaries
from
the
peloponnesus
and
a
man
of
naxos
had
come
to
them
of
his
own
motion
whose
name
was
lygdamis
and
showed
very
great
zeal
in
providing
both
money
and
men
so
starting
from
eretria
after
the
lapse
of
ten
years
they
ed
back
and
in
attica
the
first
place
of
which
they
took
possession
was
marathon
while
they
were
encamping
here
their
partisans
from
the
city
came
to
them
and
also
others
flowed
in
from
the
various
demes
to
whom
despotic
rule
was
more
welcome
than
freedom
so
these
were
gathering
themselves
together
but
the
athenians
in
the
city
so
long
as
peisistratos
was
collecting
the
money
and
afterwards
when
he
took
possession
of
marathon
made
no
account
of
it
but
when
they
heard
that
he
was
marching
from
marathon
towards
the
city
then
they
went
to
the
rescue
against
him
these
then
were
going
in
full
force
to
fight
against
the
ing
exiles
and
the
forces
of
peisistratos
as
they
went
towards
the
city
starting
from
marathon
met
them
just
when
they
came
to
the
temple
of
athene
pallenis
and
there
encamped
opposite
to
them
then
moved
by
divine
guidance
there
came
into
the
presence
of
peisistratos
amphilytos
the
arcarnanian
a
soothsayer
who
approaching
him
uttered
an
oracle
in
hexameter
verse
saying
thus
but
now
the
cast
hath
been
made
and
the
net
hath
been
widely
extended
and
in
the
night
the
tunnies
will
dart
through
the
waters
this
oracle
he
uttered
to
him
being
divinely
inspired
and
peisistratos
having
understood
the
oracle
and
having
said
that
he
accepted
the
prophecy
which
was
uttered
led
his
army
against
the
enemy
now
the
athenians
from
the
city
were
just
at
that
time
occupied
with
the
morning
meal
and
some
of
them
after
their
meal
with
games
of
dice
or
with
sleep
and
the
forces
of
peisistratos
fell
upon
the
athenians
and
put
them
to
flight
then
as
they
fled
peisistratos
devised
a
very
skilful
counsel
to
the
end
that
the
athenians
might
not
gather
again
into
one
body
but
might
remain
scattered
abroad
he
mounted
his
sons
on
horseback
and
sent
them
before
him
and
overtaking
the
fugitives
they
said
that
which
was
commanded
them
by
peisistratos
bidding
them
be
of
good
cheer
and
that
each
man
should
depart
to
his
own
home
thus
then
the
athenians
did
and
so
peisistratos
for
the
third
time
obtained
possession
of
athens
and
he
firmly
rooted
his
despotism
by
many
foreign
mercenaries
and
by
much
revenue
of
money
coming
partly
from
the
land
itself
and
partly
from
about
the
river
strymon
and
also
by
taking
as
hostages
the
sons
of
those
athenians
who
had
remained
in
the
land
and
had
not
at
once
fled
and
placing
them
in
the
hands
of
naxos
for
this
also
peisistratos
conquered
by
war
and
delivered
into
the
charge
of
lygdamis
moreover
besides
this
he
cleansed
the
island
of
delos
in
obedience
to
the
oracles
and
his
cleansing
was
of
the
following
kind
far
as
the
view
from
the
temple
extended
he
dug
up
all
the
dead
bodies
which
were
buried
in
this
part
and
removed
them
to
another
part
of
delos
so
peisistratos
was
despot
of
the
athenians
but
of
the
athenians
some
had
fallen
in
the
battle
and
others
of
them
with
the
sons
of
alcmaion
were
exiles
from
their
native
land
such
was
the
condition
of
things
which
croesus
heard
was
prevailing
among
the
athenians
during
this
time
but
as
to
the
lacedemonians
he
heard
that
they
had
escaped
from
great
evils
and
had
now
got
the
better
of
the
tegeans
in
the
war
for
when
leon
and
hegesicles
were
kings
of
sparta
the
lacedemonians
who
had
good
success
in
all
their
other
wars
suffered
disaster
in
that
alone
which
they
waged
against
the
men
of
tegea
moreover
in
the
times
before
this
they
had
the
worst
laws
of
almost
all
the
hellenes
both
in
matters
which
concerned
themselves
alone
and
also
in
that
they
had
no
dealings
with
strangers
and
they
made
their
change
to
a
good
constitution
of
laws
thus
a
man
of
the
spartans
who
was
held
in
high
repute
came
to
the
oracle
at
delphi
and
as
he
entered
the
sanctuary
of
the
temple
straightway
the
pythian
prophetess
said
as
follows
lo
thou
art
come
o
lycurgos
to
this
rich
shrine
of
my
temple
loved
thou
by
zeus
and
by
all
who
possess
the
abodes
of
olympos
whether
to
call
thee
a
god
i
doubt
in
my
voices
prophetic
god
or
a
man
but
rather
a
god
i
think
o
lycurgos
some
say
in
addition
to
this
that
the
pythian
prophetess
also
set
forth
to
him
the
order
of
things
which
is
now
established
for
the
spartans
but
the
lacedemonians
themselves
say
that
lycurgos
having
become
guardian
of
leobotes
his
brother
son
who
was
king
of
the
spartans
brought
in
these
things
from
crete
for
as
soon
as
he
became
guardian
he
changed
all
the
prevailing
laws
and
took
measures
that
they
should
not
transgress
his
institutions
and
after
this
lycurgos
established
that
which
appertained
to
war
namely
enomoties
and
triecads
and
common
meals
and
in
addition
to
this
the
ephors
and
the
senate
having
changed
thus
the
spartans
had
good
laws
and
to
lycurgos
after
he
was
dead
they
erected
a
temple
and
they
pay
him
great
worship
so
then
as
might
be
supposed
with
a
fertile
land
and
with
no
small
number
of
men
dwelling
in
it
they
straightway
shot
up
and
became
prosperous
and
it
was
no
longer
sufficient
for
them
to
keep
still
but
presuming
that
they
were
superior
in
strength
to
the
arcadians
they
consulted
the
oracle
at
delphi
respecting
conquest
of
the
whole
of
arcadia
and
the
pythian
prophetess
gave
answer
thus
the
land
of
arcadia
thou
askest
thou
askest
me
much
i
refuse
it
many
there
are
in
arcadian
land
stout
men
eating
acorns
these
will
prevent
thee
from
this
but
i
am
not
grudging
towards
thee
tegea
beaten
with
sounding
feet
i
will
give
thee
to
dance
in
and
a
fair
plain
i
will
give
thee
to
measure
with
line
and
divide
it
when
the
lacedemonians
heard
report
of
this
they
held
off
from
the
other
arcadians
and
marched
against
the
tegeans
with
fetters
in
their
hands
trusting
to
a
deceitful
oracle
and
expecting
that
they
would
make
slaves
of
the
men
of
tegea
but
having
been
worsted
in
the
encounter
those
of
them
who
were
taken
alive
worked
wearing
the
fetters
which
they
themselves
brought
with
them
and
having
measured
with
line
and
divided
the
plain
of
the
tegeans
and
these
fetters
with
which
they
had
been
bound
were
preserved
even
to
my
own
time
at
tegea
hanging
about
the
temple
of
athene
alea
in
the
former
war
then
i
say
they
struggled
against
the
tegeans
continually
with
ill
success
but
in
the
time
of
croesus
and
in
the
reign
of
anaxandrides
and
ariston
at
lacedemon
the
spartans
had
at
length
become
victors
in
the
war
and
they
became
so
in
the
following
manner
they
continued
to
be
always
worsted
in
the
war
by
the
men
of
tegea
they
sent
messengers
to
consult
the
oracle
at
delphi
and
inquired
what
god
they
should
propitiate
in
order
to
get
the
better
of
the
men
of
tegea
in
the
war
and
the
pythian
prophetess
made
answer
to
them
that
they
should
bring
into
their
land
the
bones
of
orestes
the
son
of
agamemnon
then
as
they
were
not
able
to
find
the
grave
of
orestes
they
sent
men
again
to
go
to
the
god
and
to
inquire
about
the
spot
where
orestes
was
laid
and
when
the
messengers
who
were
sent
asked
this
the
prophetess
said
as
follows
tegea
there
is
in
arcadian
land
in
a
smooth
place
founded
where
there
do
blow
two
blasts
by
strong
compulsion
together
stroke
too
there
is
and
stroke
in
and
trouble
on
trouble
there
agamemnon
son
in
the
earth
is
reposing
him
if
thou
bring
with
thee
home
of
tegea
thou
shalt
be
master
when
the
lacedemonians
had
heard
this
they
were
none
the
less
far
from
finding
it
out
though
they
searched
all
places
until
the
time
that
lichas
one
of
those
spartans
who
are
called
discovered
it
now
the
are
of
the
citizens
the
eldest
who
are
passing
from
the
ranks
of
the
horsemen
in
each
year
five
and
these
are
bound
during
that
year
in
which
they
pass
out
from
the
horsemen
to
allow
themselves
to
be
sent
without
ceasing
to
various
places
by
the
spartan
state
lichas
then
being
one
of
these
discovered
it
in
tegea
by
means
both
of
fortune
and
ability
for
as
there
were
at
that
time
dealings
under
truce
with
the
men
of
tegea
he
had
come
to
a
forge
there
and
was
looking
at
iron
being
wrought
and
he
was
in
wonder
as
he
saw
that
which
was
being
done
the
smith
therefore
perceiving
that
he
marvelled
at
it
ceased
from
his
work
and
said
surely
thou
stranger
of
lacedemon
if
thou
hadst
seen
that
which
i
once
saw
thou
wouldst
have
marvelled
much
since
now
it
falls
out
that
thou
dost
marvel
so
greatly
at
the
working
of
this
iron
for
i
desiring
in
this
enclosure
to
make
a
well
lighted
in
my
digging
upon
a
coffin
of
seven
cubits
in
length
and
not
believing
that
ever
there
had
been
men
larger
than
those
of
the
present
day
i
opened
it
and
i
saw
that
the
dead
body
was
equal
in
length
to
the
coffin
then
after
i
had
measured
it
i
filled
in
the
earth
over
it
again
he
then
thus
told
him
of
that
which
he
had
seen
and
the
other
having
thought
upon
that
which
was
told
conjectured
that
this
was
orestes
according
to
the
saying
of
the
oracle
forming
his
conjecture
in
the
following
manner
he
saw
that
the
smith
had
two
pairs
of
bellows
he
concluded
that
these
were
the
winds
spoken
of
and
that
the
anvil
and
the
hammer
were
the
stroke
and
the
stroke
in
and
that
the
iron
which
was
being
wrought
was
the
trouble
laid
upon
trouble
making
comparison
by
the
thought
that
iron
has
been
discovered
for
the
evil
of
mankind
having
thus
conjectured
he
came
back
to
sparta
and
declared
the
whole
matter
to
the
lacedemonians
and
they
brought
a
charge
against
him
on
a
fictitious
pretext
and
drove
him
out
into
exile
so
having
come
to
tegea
he
told
the
smith
of
his
evil
fortune
and
endeavoured
to
hire
from
him
the
enclosure
but
at
first
he
would
not
allow
him
to
have
it
at
length
however
lichas
persuaded
him
and
he
took
up
his
abode
there
and
he
dug
up
the
grave
and
gathered
together
the
bones
and
went
with
them
away
to
sparta
from
that
time
whenever
they
made
trial
of
one
another
the
lacedemonians
had
much
the
advantage
in
the
war
and
by
now
they
had
subdued
to
themselves
the
greater
part
of
peloponnesus
besides
croesus
accordingly
being
informed
of
all
these
things
was
sending
messengers
to
sparta
with
gifts
in
their
hands
to
ask
for
an
alliance
having
commanded
them
what
they
ought
to
say
and
they
when
they
came
said
croesus
king
of
the
lydians
and
also
of
other
nations
sent
us
hither
and
saith
as
follows
o
lacedemonians
whereas
the
god
by
an
oracle
bade
me
join
with
myself
the
hellene
as
a
friend
therefore
since
i
am
informed
that
ye
are
the
chiefs
of
hellas
i
invite
you
according
to
the
oracle
desiring
to
be
your
friend
and
your
ally
apart
from
all
guile
and
deceit
thus
did
croesus
announce
to
the
lacedemonians
through
his
messengers
and
the
lacedemonians
who
themselves
also
had
heard
of
the
oracle
given
to
croesus
were
pleased
at
the
coming
of
the
lydians
and
exchanged
oaths
of
friendship
and
alliance
for
they
were
bound
to
croesus
also
by
some
services
rendered
to
them
even
before
this
time
since
the
lacedemonians
had
sent
to
sardis
and
were
buying
gold
there
with
purpose
of
using
it
for
the
image
of
apollo
which
is
now
set
up
on
mount
thornax
in
the
lacedemonian
land
and
croesus
when
they
desired
to
buy
it
gave
it
them
as
a
gift
for
this
reason
therefore
the
lacedemonians
accepted
the
alliance
and
also
because
he
chose
them
as
his
friends
preferring
them
to
all
the
other
hellenes
and
not
only
were
they
ready
themselves
when
he
made
his
offer
but
they
caused
a
to
be
made
of
bronze
covered
outside
with
figures
round
the
rim
and
of
such
a
size
as
to
hold
three
hundred
amphors
and
this
they
conveyed
desiring
to
give
it
as
a
gift
in
to
croesus
this
bowl
never
came
to
sardis
for
reasons
of
which
two
accounts
are
given
as
follows
lacedemonians
say
that
when
the
bowl
was
on
its
way
to
sardis
and
came
opposite
the
land
of
samos
the
men
of
samos
having
heard
of
it
sailed
out
with
ships
of
war
and
took
it
away
but
the
samians
themselves
say
that
the
lacedemonians
who
were
conveying
the
bowl
finding
that
they
were
too
late
and
hearing
that
sardis
had
been
taken
and
croesus
was
a
prisoner
sold
the
bowl
in
samos
and
certain
private
persons
bought
it
and
dedicated
it
as
a
votive
offering
in
the
temple
of
hera
and
probably
those
who
had
sold
it
would
say
when
they
ed
to
sparta
that
it
had
been
taken
from
them
by
the
samians
thus
then
it
happened
about
the
but
meanwhile
croesus
mistaking
the
meaning
of
the
oracle
was
making
a
march
into
cappadokia
expecting
to
overthrow
cyrus
and
the
power
of
the
persians
and
while
croesus
was
preparing
to
march
against
the
persians
one
of
the
lydians
who
even
before
this
time
was
thought
to
be
a
wise
man
but
in
consequence
of
this
opinion
got
a
very
great
name
for
wisdom
among
the
lydians
had
advised
croesus
as
follows
the
name
of
the
man
was
sandanis
o
king
thou
art
preparing
to
march
against
men
who
wear
breeches
of
leather
and
the
rest
of
their
clothing
is
of
leather
also
and
they
eat
food
not
such
as
they
desire
but
such
as
they
can
obtain
dwelling
in
a
land
which
is
rugged
and
moreover
they
make
no
use
of
wine
but
drink
water
and
no
figs
have
they
for
dessert
nor
any
other
good
thing
on
the
one
hand
if
thou
shalt
overcome
them
what
wilt
thou
take
away
from
them
seeing
they
have
nothing
and
on
the
other
hand
if
thou
shalt
be
overcome
consider
how
many
good
things
thou
wilt
lose
for
once
having
tasted
our
good
things
they
will
cling
to
them
fast
and
it
will
not
be
possible
to
drive
them
away
i
for
my
own
part
feel
gratitude
to
the
gods
that
they
do
not
put
it
into
the
minds
of
the
persians
to
march
against
the
lydians
thus
he
spoke
not
persuading
croesus
for
it
is
true
indeed
that
the
persians
before
they
subdued
the
lydians
had
no
luxury
nor
any
good
thing
now
the
cappadokians
are
called
by
the
hellenes
syrians
and
these
syrians
before
the
persians
had
rule
were
subjects
of
the
medes
but
at
this
time
they
were
subjects
of
cyrus
for
the
boundary
between
the
median
empire
and
the
lydian
was
the
river
halys
and
this
flows
from
the
of
armenia
through
the
kilikians
and
afterwards
as
it
flows
it
has
the
matienians
on
the
right
hand
and
the
phrygians
on
the
other
side
then
passing
by
these
and
flowing
up
towards
the
north
wind
it
bounds
on
the
one
side
the
cappadokian
syrians
and
on
the
left
hand
the
paphlagonians
thus
the
river
halys
cuts
off
from
the
rest
almost
all
the
lower
parts
of
asia
by
a
line
extending
from
the
sea
that
is
opposite
cyprus
to
the
euxine
and
this
tract
is
the
neck
of
the
whole
peninsula
the
distance
of
the
journey
being
such
that
five
days
are
spent
on
the
way
by
a
man
without
encumbrance
now
for
the
following
reasons
croesus
was
marching
into
cappadokia
because
he
desired
to
acquire
the
land
in
addition
to
his
own
possessions
and
then
especially
because
he
had
confidence
in
the
oracle
and
wished
to
take
vengeance
on
cyrus
for
astyages
for
cyrus
the
son
of
cambyses
had
conquered
astyages
and
was
keeping
him
in
captivity
who
was
brother
by
marriage
to
croesus
and
king
of
the
medes
and
he
had
become
the
brother
by
marriage
of
croesus
in
this
manner
horde
of
the
nomad
scythians
at
feud
with
the
rest
withdrew
and
sought
refuge
in
the
land
of
the
medes
and
at
this
time
the
ruler
of
the
medes
was
kyaxares
the
son
of
phraortes
the
son
of
deïokes
who
at
first
dealt
well
with
these
scythians
being
suppliants
for
his
protection
and
esteeming
them
very
highly
he
delivered
boys
to
them
to
learn
their
speech
and
the
art
of
shooting
with
the
bow
then
time
went
by
and
the
scythians
used
to
go
out
continually
to
the
chase
and
always
brought
back
something
till
once
it
happened
that
they
took
nothing
and
when
they
ed
with
empty
hands
kyaxares
being
as
he
showed
on
this
occasion
not
of
an
eminently
good
disposition
dealt
with
them
very
harshly
and
used
insult
towards
them
and
they
when
they
had
received
this
treatment
from
kyaxares
considering
that
they
had
suffered
indignity
planned
to
kill
and
to
cut
up
one
of
the
boys
who
were
being
instructed
among
them
and
having
dressed
his
flesh
as
they
had
been
wont
to
dress
the
wild
animals
to
bear
it
to
kyaxares
and
give
it
to
him
pretending
that
it
was
game
taken
in
hunting
and
when
they
had
given
it
their
design
was
to
make
their
way
as
quickly
as
possible
to
alyattes
the
son
of
sadyattes
at
sardis
this
then
was
done
and
kyaxares
with
the
guests
who
ate
at
his
table
tasted
of
that
meat
and
the
scythians
having
so
done
became
suppliants
for
the
protection
of
alyattes
after
this
seeing
that
alyattes
would
not
give
up
the
scythians
when
kyaxares
demanded
them
there
had
arisen
war
between
the
lydians
and
the
medes
lasting
five
years
in
which
years
the
medes
often
discomfited
the
lydians
and
the
lydians
often
discomfited
the
medes
and
among
others
they
fought
also
a
battle
by
night
and
as
they
still
carried
on
the
war
with
equally
balanced
fortune
in
the
sixth
year
a
battle
took
place
in
which
it
happened
when
the
fight
had
begun
that
suddenly
the
day
became
night
and
this
change
of
the
day
thales
the
milesian
had
foretold
to
the
ionians
laying
down
as
a
limit
this
very
year
in
which
the
change
took
place
the
lydians
however
and
the
medes
when
they
saw
that
it
had
become
night
instead
of
day
ceased
from
their
fighting
and
were
much
more
eager
both
of
them
that
peace
should
be
made
between
them
and
they
who
brought
about
the
peace
between
them
were
syennesis
the
kilikian
and
labynetos
the
babylonian
these
were
they
who
urged
also
the
taking
of
the
oath
by
them
and
they
brought
about
an
interchange
of
marriages
for
they
decided
that
alyattes
should
give
his
daughter
aryenis
to
astyages
the
son
of
kyaxares
seeing
that
without
the
compulsion
of
a
strong
tie
agreements
are
apt
not
to
hold
strongly
together
now
these
nations
observe
the
same
ceremonies
in
taking
oaths
as
the
hellenes
and
in
addition
to
them
they
make
incision
into
the
skin
of
their
arms
and
then
lick
up
the
blood
each
of
the
other
this
astyages
then
being
his
mother
father
cyrus
had
conquered
and
made
prisoner
for
a
reason
which
i
shall
declare
in
the
history
which
comes
after
this
then
was
the
complaint
which
croesus
had
against
cyrus
when
he
sent
to
the
oracles
to
ask
if
he
should
march
against
the
persians
and
when
a
deceitful
answer
had
come
back
to
him
he
marched
into
the
dominion
of
the
persians
supposing
that
the
answer
was
favourable
to
himself
and
when
croesus
came
to
the
river
halys
then
according
to
my
account
he
passed
his
army
across
by
the
bridges
which
there
were
but
according
to
the
account
which
prevails
among
the
hellenes
thales
the
milesian
enabled
him
to
pass
his
army
across
for
say
they
when
croesus
was
at
a
loss
how
his
army
should
pass
over
the
river
since
they
add
there
were
not
yet
at
that
time
the
bridges
which
now
there
are
thales
being
present
in
the
army
caused
the
river
which
flowed
then
on
the
left
hand
of
the
army
to
flow
partly
also
on
the
right
and
he
did
it
thus
above
the
camp
he
proceeded
to
dig
a
deep
channel
directing
it
in
the
form
of
a
crescent
moon
so
that
the
river
might
take
the
camp
there
pitched
in
the
rear
being
turned
aside
from
its
ancient
course
by
this
way
along
the
channel
and
afterwards
passing
by
the
camp
might
fall
again
into
its
ancient
course
so
that
as
soon
as
the
river
was
thus
parted
in
two
it
became
fordable
by
both
branches
and
some
say
even
that
the
ancient
course
of
the
river
was
altogether
dried
up
but
this
tale
i
do
not
admit
as
true
for
how
then
did
they
pass
over
the
river
as
they
went
back
and
croesus
when
he
had
passed
over
with
his
army
came
to
that
place
in
cappadokia
which
is
called
pteria
now
pteria
is
the
strongest
place
in
this
country
and
is
situated
somewhere
about
in
a
line
with
the
city
of
sinope
on
the
euxine
here
he
encamped
and
ravaged
the
fields
of
the
syrians
moreover
he
took
the
city
of
the
pterians
and
sold
the
people
into
slavery
and
he
took
also
all
the
towns
that
lay
about
it
and
the
syrians
who
were
not
guilty
of
any
wrong
he
forced
to
remove
from
their
homes
meanwhile
cyrus
having
gathered
his
own
forces
and
having
taken
up
in
addition
to
them
all
who
dwelt
in
the
region
between
was
coming
to
meet
croesus
before
he
began
however
to
lead
forth
his
army
he
had
sent
heralds
to
the
ionians
and
tried
to
induce
them
to
revolt
from
croesus
but
the
ionians
would
not
do
as
he
said
then
when
cyrus
was
come
and
had
encamped
over
against
croesus
they
made
trial
of
one
another
by
force
of
arms
in
the
land
of
pteria
and
after
hard
fighting
when
many
had
fallen
on
both
sides
at
length
night
having
come
on
they
parted
from
one
the
other
with
no
victory
on
either
side
thus
the
two
armies
contended
with
one
another
and
croesus
being
ill
satisfied
with
his
own
army
in
respect
of
number
for
the
army
which
he
had
when
he
fought
was
far
smaller
than
that
of
cyrus
being
dissatisfied
with
it
i
say
on
this
account
as
cyrus
did
not
attempt
to
advance
against
him
on
the
following
day
marched
back
to
sardis
having
it
in
his
mind
to
call
the
egyptians
to
his
help
according
to
the
oath
which
they
had
taken
for
he
had
made
an
alliance
with
amasis
king
of
egypt
before
he
made
the
alliance
with
the
lacedemonians
and
to
summon
the
babylonians
as
well
for
with
these
also
an
alliance
had
been
concluded
by
him
labynetos
being
at
that
time
ruler
of
the
babylonians
and
moreover
to
send
a
message
to
the
lacedemonians
bidding
them
appear
at
a
fixed
time
and
then
after
he
had
got
all
these
together
and
had
gathered
his
own
army
his
design
was
to
let
the
winter
go
by
and
at
the
coming
of
spring
to
march
against
the
persians
so
with
these
thoughts
in
his
mind
as
soon
as
he
came
to
sardis
he
proceeded
to
send
heralds
to
his
several
allies
to
give
them
notice
that
by
the
fifth
month
from
that
time
they
should
assemble
at
sardis
but
the
army
which
he
had
with
him
and
which
had
fought
with
the
persians
an
army
which
consisted
of
mercenary
troops
he
let
go
and
disbanded
altogether
never
expecting
that
cyrus
after
having
contended
against
him
with
such
even
fortune
would
after
all
march
upon
sardis
when
croesus
had
these
plans
in
his
mind
the
suburb
of
the
city
became
of
a
sudden
all
full
of
serpents
and
when
these
had
appeared
the
horses
leaving
off
to
feed
in
their
pastures
came
constantly
thither
and
devoured
them
when
croesus
saw
this
he
deemed
it
to
be
a
portent
as
indeed
it
was
and
forthwith
he
despatched
messengers
to
the
dwelling
of
the
telmessians
who
interpret
omens
and
the
messengers
who
were
sent
to
consult
arrived
there
and
learnt
from
the
telmessians
what
the
portent
meant
to
signify
but
they
did
not
succeed
in
reporting
the
answer
to
croesus
for
before
they
sailed
back
to
sardis
croesus
had
been
taken
prisoner
the
telmessians
however
gave
decision
thus
that
an
army
speaking
a
foreign
tongue
was
to
be
looked
for
by
croesus
to
invade
his
land
and
that
this
when
it
came
would
subdue
the
native
inhabitants
for
they
said
that
the
serpent
was
born
of
the
soil
while
the
horse
was
an
enemy
and
a
stranger
the
men
of
telmessos
thus
made
answer
to
croesus
after
he
was
already
taken
prisoner
not
knowing
as
yet
anything
of
the
things
which
had
happened
to
sardis
and
to
croesus
himself
cyrus
however
so
soon
as
croesus
marched
away
after
the
battle
which
had
been
fought
in
pteria
having
learnt
that
croesus
meant
after
he
had
marched
away
to
disband
his
army
took
counsel
with
himself
and
concluded
that
it
was
good
for
him
to
march
as
quickly
as
possible
to
sardis
before
the
power
of
the
lydians
should
be
again
gathered
together
so
when
he
had
resolved
upon
this
he
did
it
without
delay
for
he
marched
his
army
into
lydia
with
such
speed
that
he
was
himself
the
first
to
announce
his
coming
to
croesus
then
croesus
although
he
had
come
to
a
great
strait
since
his
affairs
had
fallen
out
altogether
contrary
to
his
own
expectation
yet
proceeded
to
lead
forth
the
lydians
into
battle
now
there
was
at
this
time
no
nation
in
asia
more
courageous
or
more
stout
in
battle
than
the
lydian
and
they
fought
on
horseback
carrying
long
spears
the
men
being
excellent
in
horsemanship
so
when
the
armies
had
met
in
that
plain
which
is
in
front
of
the
city
of
sardis
plain
wide
and
open
through
which
flow
rivers
and
especially
the
river
hyllos
all
rushing
down
to
join
the
largest
called
hermos
which
flows
from
the
mountain
sacred
to
the
mother
surnamed
of
dindymos
and
runs
out
into
the
sea
by
the
city
of
phocaia
cyrus
when
he
saw
the
lydians
being
arrayed
for
battle
fearing
their
horsemen
did
on
the
suggestion
of
harpagos
a
mede
as
follows
the
camels
which
were
in
the
train
of
his
army
carrying
provisions
and
baggage
he
gathered
together
and
he
took
off
their
burdens
and
set
men
upon
them
provided
with
the
equipment
of
cavalry
and
having
thus
furnished
them
forth
he
appointed
them
to
go
in
front
of
the
rest
of
the
army
towards
the
horsemen
of
croesus
and
after
the
he
ordered
the
infantry
to
follow
and
behind
the
infantry
he
placed
his
whole
force
of
cavalry
then
when
all
his
men
had
been
placed
in
their
several
positions
he
charged
them
to
spare
none
of
the
other
lydians
slaying
all
who
might
come
in
their
way
but
croesus
himself
they
were
not
to
slay
not
even
if
he
should
make
resistance
when
he
was
captured
such
was
his
charge
and
he
set
the
camels
opposite
the
horsemen
for
this
reason
the
horse
has
a
fear
of
the
camel
and
can
not
endure
either
to
see
his
form
or
to
scent
his
smell
for
this
reason
then
the
trick
had
been
devised
in
order
that
the
cavalry
of
croesus
might
be
useless
that
very
force
wherewith
the
lydian
king
was
expecting
most
to
shine
and
as
they
were
coming
together
to
the
battle
so
soon
as
the
horses
scented
the
camels
and
saw
them
they
turned
away
back
and
the
hopes
of
croesus
were
at
once
brought
to
nought
the
lydians
however
for
their
part
did
not
upon
that
act
as
cowards
but
when
they
perceived
what
was
coming
to
pass
they
leapt
from
their
horses
and
fought
with
the
persians
on
foot
at
length
however
when
many
had
fallen
on
either
side
the
lydians
turned
to
flight
and
having
been
driven
within
the
wall
of
their
fortress
they
were
besieged
by
the
persians
by
these
then
a
siege
had
been
established
but
croesus
supposing
that
the
siege
would
last
a
long
time
proceeded
to
send
from
the
fortress
other
messengers
to
his
allies
for
the
former
messengers
were
sent
round
to
give
notice
that
they
should
assemble
at
sardis
by
the
fifth
month
but
these
he
was
sending
out
to
ask
them
to
come
to
his
assistance
as
quickly
as
possible
because
croesus
was
being
besieged
so
then
in
sending
to
his
other
allies
he
sent
also
to
lacedemon
but
these
too
the
spartans
i
mean
had
themselves
at
this
very
time
for
so
it
had
fallen
out
a
quarrel
in
hand
with
the
argives
about
the
district
called
thyrea
for
this
thyrea
being
part
of
the
argive
possessions
the
lacedemonians
had
cut
off
and
taken
for
themselves
now
the
whole
region
towards
the
west
extending
as
far
down
as
malea
was
then
possessed
by
the
argives
both
the
parts
situated
on
the
mainland
and
also
the
island
of
kythera
with
the
other
islands
and
when
the
argives
had
come
to
the
rescue
to
save
their
territory
from
being
cut
off
from
them
then
the
two
sides
came
to
a
parley
together
and
agreed
that
three
hundred
should
fight
of
each
side
and
whichever
side
had
the
better
in
the
fight
that
nation
should
possess
the
disputed
land
they
agreed
moreover
that
the
main
body
of
each
army
should
withdraw
to
their
own
country
and
not
stand
by
while
the
contest
was
fought
for
fear
lest
if
the
armies
were
present
one
side
seeing
their
countrymen
suffering
defeat
should
come
up
to
their
support
having
made
this
agreement
they
withdrew
and
chosen
men
of
both
sides
were
left
behind
and
engaged
in
fight
with
one
another
so
they
fought
and
proved
themselves
to
be
equally
matched
and
there
were
left
at
last
of
six
hundred
men
three
on
the
side
of
the
argives
alkenor
and
chromios
and
on
the
side
of
the
lacedemonians
othryades
these
were
left
alive
when
night
came
on
so
then
the
two
men
of
the
argives
supposing
that
they
were
the
victors
set
off
to
run
to
argos
but
the
lacedemonian
othryades
after
having
stripped
the
corpses
of
the
argives
and
carried
their
arms
to
his
own
camp
remained
in
his
place
on
the
next
day
both
the
two
sides
came
thither
to
inquire
about
the
result
and
for
some
time
both
claimed
the
victory
for
themselves
the
one
side
saying
that
of
them
more
had
remained
alive
and
the
others
declaring
that
these
had
fled
away
whereas
their
own
man
had
stood
his
ground
and
had
stripped
the
corpses
of
the
other
party
and
at
length
by
reason
of
this
dispute
they
fell
upon
one
another
and
began
to
fight
and
after
many
had
fallen
on
both
sides
the
lacedemonians
were
the
victors
the
argives
then
cut
their
hair
short
whereas
formerly
they
were
compelled
by
law
to
wear
it
long
and
they
made
a
law
with
a
curse
attached
to
it
that
from
that
time
forth
no
man
of
the
argives
should
grow
the
hair
long
nor
their
women
wear
ornaments
of
gold
until
they
should
have
won
back
thyrea
the
lacedemonians
however
laid
down
for
themselves
the
opposite
law
to
this
namely
that
they
should
wear
long
hair
from
that
time
forward
whereas
before
that
time
they
had
not
their
hair
long
and
they
say
that
the
one
man
who
was
left
alive
of
the
three
hundred
namely
othryades
being
ashamed
to
to
sparta
when
all
his
comrades
had
been
slain
slew
himself
there
in
thyrea
such
was
the
condition
of
things
at
sparta
when
the
herald
from
sardis
arrived
asking
them
to
come
to
the
assistance
of
croesus
who
was
being
besieged
and
they
notwithstanding
their
own
difficulties
as
soon
as
they
heard
the
news
from
the
herald
were
eager
to
go
to
his
assistance
but
when
they
had
completed
their
preparations
and
their
ships
were
ready
there
came
another
message
reporting
that
the
fortress
of
the
lydians
had
been
taken
and
that
croesus
had
been
made
prisoner
then
and
not
before
they
ceased
from
their
efforts
being
grieved
at
the
event
as
at
a
great
calamity
now
the
taking
of
sardis
came
about
as
follows
the
fourteenth
day
came
after
croesus
began
to
be
besieged
cyrus
made
proclamation
to
his
army
sending
horsemen
round
to
the
several
parts
of
it
that
he
would
give
gifts
to
the
man
who
should
first
scale
the
wall
after
this
the
army
made
an
attempt
and
when
it
failed
then
after
all
the
rest
had
ceased
from
the
attack
a
certain
mardian
whose
name
was
hyroiades
made
an
attempt
to
approach
on
that
side
of
the
citadel
where
no
guard
had
been
set
for
they
had
no
fear
that
it
would
ever
be
taken
from
that
side
seeing
that
here
the
citadel
is
precipitous
and
unassailable
to
this
part
of
the
wall
alone
meles
also
who
formerly
was
king
of
sardis
did
not
carry
round
the
lion
which
his
concubine
bore
to
him
the
telmessians
having
given
decision
that
if
the
lion
should
be
carried
round
the
wall
sardis
should
be
safe
from
capture
and
meles
having
carried
it
round
the
rest
of
the
wall
that
is
to
say
those
parts
of
the
citadel
where
the
fortress
was
open
to
attack
passed
over
this
part
as
being
unassailable
and
precipitous
now
this
is
a
part
of
the
city
which
is
turned
towards
tmolos
so
then
this
mardian
hyroiades
having
seen
on
the
day
before
how
one
of
the
lydians
had
descended
on
that
side
of
the
citadel
to
recover
his
helmet
which
had
rolled
down
from
above
and
had
picked
it
up
took
thought
and
cast
the
matter
about
in
his
own
mind
then
he
himself
ascended
first
and
after
him
came
up
others
of
the
persians
and
many
having
thus
made
approach
sardis
was
finally
taken
and
the
whole
city
was
given
up
to
plunder
meanwhile
to
croesus
himself
it
happened
thus
had
a
son
of
whom
i
made
mention
before
who
was
of
good
disposition
enough
but
deprived
of
speech
now
in
his
former
time
of
prosperity
croesus
had
done
everything
that
was
possible
for
him
and
besides
other
things
which
he
devised
he
had
also
sent
messengers
to
delphi
to
inquire
concerning
him
and
the
pythian
prophetess
spoke
to
him
thus
lydian
master
of
many
much
blind
to
destiny
croesus
do
not
desire
to
hear
in
thy
halls
that
voice
which
is
prayed
for
voice
of
thy
son
much
better
if
this
from
thee
were
removèd
since
he
shall
first
utter
speech
in
an
evil
day
of
misfortune
now
when
the
fortress
was
being
taken
one
of
the
persians
was
about
to
slay
croesus
taking
him
for
another
and
croesus
for
his
part
seeing
him
coming
on
cared
nothing
for
it
because
of
the
misfortune
which
was
upon
him
and
to
him
it
was
indifferent
that
he
should
be
slain
by
the
stroke
but
this
voiceless
son
when
he
saw
the
persian
coming
on
by
reason
of
terror
and
affliction
burst
the
bonds
of
his
utterance
and
said
man
slay
not
croesus
this
son
i
say
uttered
voice
then
first
of
all
but
after
this
he
continued
to
use
speech
for
the
whole
time
of
his
life
the
persians
then
had
obtained
possession
of
sardis
and
had
taken
croesus
himself
prisoner
after
he
had
reigned
fourteen
years
and
had
been
besieged
fourteen
days
having
fulfilled
the
oracle
in
that
he
had
brought
to
an
end
his
own
great
empire
so
the
persians
having
taken
him
brought
him
into
the
presence
of
cyrus
and
he
piled
up
a
great
pyre
and
caused
croesus
to
go
up
upon
it
bound
in
fetters
and
along
with
him
twice
seven
sons
of
lydians
whether
it
was
that
he
meant
to
dedicate
this
offering
as
of
his
victory
to
some
god
or
whether
he
desired
to
fulfil
a
vow
or
else
had
heard
that
croesus
was
a
man
and
so
caused
him
to
go
up
on
the
pyre
because
he
wished
to
know
if
any
one
of
the
divine
powers
would
save
him
so
that
he
should
not
be
burnt
alive
he
they
say
did
this
but
to
croesus
as
he
stood
upon
the
pyre
there
came
although
he
was
in
such
evil
case
a
memory
of
the
saying
of
solon
how
he
had
said
with
divine
inspiration
that
no
one
of
the
living
might
be
called
happy
and
when
this
thought
came
into
his
mind
they
say
that
he
sighed
deeply
and
groaned
aloud
having
been
for
long
silent
and
three
times
he
uttered
the
name
of
solon
hearing
this
cyrus
bade
the
interpreters
ask
croesus
who
was
this
person
on
whom
he
called
and
they
came
near
and
asked
and
croesus
for
a
time
it
is
said
kept
silence
when
he
was
asked
this
but
afterwards
being
pressed
he
said
one
whom
more
than
much
wealth
i
should
have
desired
to
have
speech
with
all
monarchs
then
since
his
words
were
of
doubtful
import
they
asked
again
of
that
which
he
said
and
as
they
were
urgent
with
him
and
gave
him
no
peace
he
told
how
once
solon
an
athenian
had
come
and
having
inspected
all
his
wealth
had
made
light
of
it
with
such
and
such
words
and
how
all
had
turned
out
for
him
according
as
solon
had
said
not
speaking
at
all
especially
with
a
view
to
croesus
himself
but
with
a
view
to
the
whole
human
race
and
especially
those
who
seem
to
themselves
to
be
happy
men
and
while
croesus
related
these
things
already
the
pyre
was
lighted
and
the
edges
of
it
round
about
were
burning
then
they
say
that
cyrus
hearing
from
the
interpreters
what
croesus
had
said
changed
his
purpose
and
considered
that
he
himself
also
was
but
a
man
and
that
he
was
delivering
another
man
who
had
been
not
inferior
to
himself
in
felicity
alive
to
the
fire
and
moreover
he
feared
the
requital
and
reflected
that
there
was
nothing
of
that
which
men
possessed
which
was
secure
therefore
they
say
he
ordered
them
to
extinguish
as
quickly
as
possible
the
fire
that
was
burning
and
to
bring
down
croesus
and
those
who
were
with
him
from
the
pyre
and
they
using
endeavours
were
not
able
now
to
get
the
mastery
of
the
flames
then
it
is
related
by
the
lydians
that
croesus
having
learned
how
cyrus
had
changed
his
mind
and
seeing
that
every
one
was
trying
to
put
out
the
fire
but
that
they
were
no
longer
able
to
check
it
cried
aloud
entreating
apollo
that
if
any
gift
had
ever
been
given
by
him
which
had
been
acceptable
to
the
god
he
would
come
to
his
aid
and
rescue
him
from
the
evil
which
was
now
upon
him
so
he
with
tears
entreated
the
god
and
suddenly
they
say
after
clear
sky
and
calm
weather
clouds
gathered
and
a
storm
burst
and
it
rained
with
a
very
violent
shower
and
the
pyre
was
extinguished
then
cyrus
having
perceived
that
croesus
was
a
lover
of
the
gods
and
a
good
man
caused
him
to
be
brought
down
from
the
pyre
and
asked
him
as
follows
croesus
tell
me
who
of
all
men
was
it
who
persuaded
thee
to
march
upon
my
land
and
so
to
become
an
enemy
to
me
instead
of
a
friend
and
he
said
o
king
i
did
this
to
thy
felicity
and
to
my
own
misfortune
and
the
causer
of
this
was
the
god
of
the
hellenes
who
incited
me
to
march
with
my
army
for
no
one
is
so
senseless
as
to
choose
of
his
own
will
war
rather
peace
since
in
peace
the
sons
bury
their
fathers
but
in
war
the
fathers
bury
their
sons
but
it
was
pleasing
i
suppose
to
the
divine
powers
that
these
things
should
come
to
pass
thus
so
he
spoke
and
cyrus
loosed
his
bonds
and
caused
him
to
sit
near
himself
and
paid
to
him
much
regard
and
he
marvelled
both
himself
and
all
who
were
about
him
at
the
sight
of
croesus
and
croesus
wrapt
in
thought
was
silent
but
after
a
time
turning
round
and
seeing
the
persians
plundering
the
city
of
the
lydians
he
said
o
king
must
i
say
to
thee
that
which
i
chance
to
have
in
my
thought
or
must
i
keep
silent
in
this
my
present
fortune
then
cyrus
bade
him
say
boldly
whatsoever
he
desired
and
he
asked
him
saying
what
is
the
business
that
this
great
multitude
of
men
is
doing
with
so
much
eagerness
and
he
said
they
are
plundering
thy
city
and
carrying
away
thy
wealth
and
croesus
answered
neither
is
it
my
city
that
they
are
plundering
nor
my
wealth
which
they
are
carrying
away
for
i
have
no
longer
any
property
in
these
things
but
it
is
thy
wealth
that
they
are
carrying
and
driving
away
and
cyrus
was
concerned
by
that
which
croesus
had
said
and
he
caused
all
the
rest
to
withdraw
and
asked
croesus
what
he
discerned
for
his
advantage
as
regards
that
which
was
being
done
and
he
said
since
the
gods
gave
me
to
thee
as
a
slave
i
think
it
right
if
i
discern
anything
more
than
others
to
signify
it
to
thee
the
persians
who
are
by
nature
unruly
are
without
wealth
if
therefore
thou
shalt
suffer
them
to
carry
off
in
plunder
great
wealth
and
to
take
possession
of
it
then
it
is
to
be
looked
for
that
thou
wilt
experience
this
result
thou
must
expect
namely
that
whosoever
gets
possession
of
the
largest
share
will
make
insurrection
against
thee
now
therefore
if
that
which
i
say
is
pleasing
to
thee
do
this
spearmen
of
thy
guard
to
watch
at
all
the
gates
and
let
these
take
away
the
things
and
say
to
the
men
who
were
bearing
them
out
of
the
city
that
they
must
first
be
tithed
for
zeus
and
thus
thou
on
the
one
hand
wilt
not
be
hated
by
them
for
taking
away
the
things
by
force
and
they
on
the
other
will
willingly
let
the
things
go
acknowledging
within
themselves
that
thou
art
doing
that
which
is
just
hearing
this
cyrus
was
above
measure
pleased
because
he
thought
that
croesus
advised
well
and
he
commended
him
much
and
enjoined
the
spearmen
of
his
guard
to
perform
that
which
croesus
had
advised
and
after
that
he
spoke
to
croesus
thus
croesus
since
thou
art
prepared
like
a
king
as
thou
art
to
do
good
deeds
and
speak
good
words
therefore
ask
me
for
a
gift
whatsoever
thou
desirest
to
be
given
thee
forthwith
and
he
said
master
thou
wilt
most
do
me
a
pleasure
if
thou
wilt
permit
me
to
send
to
the
god
of
the
hellenes
whom
i
honoured
most
of
all
gods
these
fetters
and
to
ask
him
whether
it
is
accounted
by
him
right
to
deceive
those
who
do
well
to
him
then
cyrus
asked
him
what
accusation
he
made
against
the
god
that
he
thus
requested
and
croesus
repeated
to
him
all
that
had
been
in
his
mind
and
the
answers
of
the
oracles
and
especially
the
votive
offerings
and
how
he
had
been
incited
by
the
prophecy
to
march
upon
the
persians
and
thus
speaking
he
came
back
again
to
the
request
that
it
might
be
permitted
to
him
to
make
this
reproach
against
the
god
and
cyrus
laughed
and
said
not
this
only
shalt
thou
obtain
from
me
croesus
but
also
whatsoever
thou
mayst
desire
of
me
at
any
time
hearing
this
croesus
sent
certain
of
the
lydians
to
delphi
enjoining
them
to
lay
the
fetters
upon
the
threshold
of
the
temple
and
to
ask
the
god
whether
he
felt
no
shame
that
he
had
incited
croesus
by
his
prophecies
to
march
upon
the
persians
persuading
him
that
he
should
bring
to
an
end
the
empire
of
cyrus
seeing
that
these
were
the
of
spoil
which
he
had
won
from
it
the
same
time
displaying
the
fetters
this
they
were
to
ask
and
moreover
also
whether
it
was
thought
right
by
the
gods
of
the
hellenes
to
practice
ingratitude
when
the
lydians
came
and
repeated
that
which
they
were
enjoined
to
say
it
is
related
that
the
pythian
prophetess
spoke
as
follows
the
fated
destiny
it
is
impossible
even
for
a
god
to
escape
and
croesus
paid
the
debt
due
for
the
sin
of
his
fifth
ancestor
who
being
one
of
the
spearmen
of
the
heracleidai
followed
the
treacherous
device
of
a
woman
and
having
slain
his
master
took
possession
of
his
royal
dignity
which
belonged
not
to
him
of
right
and
although
loxias
eagerly
desired
that
the
calamity
of
sardis
might
come
upon
the
sons
of
croesus
and
not
upon
croesus
himself
it
was
not
possible
for
him
to
draw
the
destinies
aside
from
their
course
but
so
much
as
these
granted
he
brought
to
pass
and
gave
it
as
a
gift
to
croesus
for
he
put
off
the
taking
of
sardis
by
three
years
and
let
croesus
be
assured
that
he
was
taken
prisoner
later
by
these
years
than
the
fated
time
moreover
secondly
he
assisted
him
when
he
was
about
to
be
burnt
and
as
to
the
oracle
which
was
given
croesus
finds
fault
with
good
ground
for
loxias
told
him
beforehand
that
if
he
should
march
upon
the
persians
he
should
destroy
a
great
empire
and
he
upon
hearing
this
if
he
wished
to
take
counsel
well
ought
to
have
sent
and
asked
further
whether
the
god
meant
his
own
empire
or
that
of
cyrus
but
as
he
did
not
comprehend
that
which
was
uttered
and
did
not
ask
again
let
him
pronounce
himself
to
be
the
cause
of
that
which
followed
to
him
also
when
he
consulted
the
oracle
for
the
last
time
loxias
said
that
which
he
said
concerning
a
mule
but
this
also
he
failed
to
comprehend
for
cyrus
was
in
fact
this
mule
seeing
that
he
was
born
of
parents
who
were
of
two
different
races
his
mother
being
of
nobler
descent
and
his
father
of
less
noble
for
she
was
a
median
woman
daughter
of
astyages
and
king
of
the
medes
but
he
was
a
persian
one
of
a
race
subject
to
the
medes
and
being
inferior
in
all
respects
he
was
the
husband
of
one
who
was
his
royal
mistress
thus
the
pythian
prophetess
replied
to
the
lydians
and
they
brought
the
answer
back
to
sardis
and
repeated
it
to
croesus
and
he
when
he
heard
it
acknowledged
that
the
fault
was
his
own
and
not
that
of
the
god
with
regard
then
to
the
empire
of
croesus
and
the
first
conquest
of
ionia
it
happened
thus
now
there
are
in
hellas
many
other
votive
offerings
made
by
croesus
and
not
only
those
which
have
been
mentioned
for
first
at
thebes
of
the
boeotians
there
is
a
tripod
of
gold
which
he
dedicated
to
the
ismenian
apollo
then
at
ephesos
there
are
the
golden
cows
and
the
greater
number
of
the
pillars
of
the
temple
and
in
the
temple
of
athene
pronaia
at
delphi
a
large
golden
shield
these
were
still
remaining
down
to
my
own
time
but
others
of
his
votive
offerings
have
perished
and
the
votive
offerings
of
croesus
at
branchidai
of
the
milesians
were
as
i
am
told
equal
in
weight
and
similar
to
those
at
delphi
now
those
which
he
sent
to
delphi
and
to
the
temple
of
amphiaraos
he
dedicated
of
his
own
goods
and
as
of
the
wealth
inherited
from
his
father
but
the
other
offerings
were
made
of
the
substance
of
a
man
who
was
his
foe
who
before
croesus
became
king
had
been
factious
against
him
and
had
joined
in
endeavouring
to
make
pantaleon
ruler
of
the
lydians
now
pantaleon
was
a
son
of
alyattes
and
a
brother
of
croesus
but
not
by
the
same
mother
for
croesus
was
born
to
alyattes
of
a
carian
woman
but
pantaleon
of
an
ionian
and
when
croesus
had
gained
possession
of
the
kingdom
by
the
gift
of
his
father
he
put
to
death
the
man
who
opposed
him
drawing
him
upon
the
and
his
property
which
even
before
that
time
he
had
vowed
to
dedicate
he
then
offered
in
the
manner
mentioned
to
those
shrines
which
have
been
named
about
his
votive
offerings
let
it
suffice
to
have
said
so
much
of
marvels
to
be
recorded
the
land
of
lydia
has
no
great
store
as
compared
with
other
lands
excepting
the
which
is
carried
down
from
tmolos
but
one
work
it
has
to
show
which
is
larger
far
than
any
other
except
only
those
in
egypt
and
babylon
for
there
is
there
the
sepulchral
monument
of
alyattes
the
father
of
croesus
of
which
the
base
is
made
of
larger
stones
and
the
rest
of
the
monument
is
of
earth
piled
up
and
this
was
built
by
contributions
of
those
who
practised
trade
and
of
the
artisans
and
the
girls
who
plied
their
traffic
there
and
still
there
existed
to
my
own
time
five
in
number
erected
upon
the
monument
above
on
which
were
carved
inscriptions
telling
how
much
of
the
work
was
done
by
each
class
and
upon
measurement
it
was
found
that
the
work
of
the
girls
was
the
greatest
in
amount
for
the
daughters
of
the
common
people
in
lydia
practice
prostitution
one
and
all
to
gather
for
themselves
dowries
continuing
this
until
the
time
when
they
marry
and
the
girls
give
themselves
away
in
marriage
now
the
circuit
of
the
monument
is
six
furlongs
and
two
hundred
feet
and
the
breadth
is
thirteen
hundred
feet
and
adjoining
the
monument
is
a
great
lake
which
the
lydians
say
has
a
supply
of
water
and
it
is
called
the
lake
of
gyges
such
is
the
nature
of
this
monument
now
the
lydians
have
very
nearly
the
same
customs
as
the
hellenes
with
the
exception
that
they
prostitute
their
female
children
and
they
were
the
first
of
men
so
far
as
we
know
who
struck
and
used
coin
of
gold
or
silver
and
also
they
were
the
first
and
the
lydians
themselves
say
that
the
games
which
are
now
in
use
among
them
and
among
the
hellenes
were
also
their
invention
these
they
say
were
invented
among
them
at
the
same
time
as
they
colonised
tyrsenia
and
this
is
the
account
they
give
of
them
the
reign
of
atys
the
son
of
manes
their
king
there
came
to
be
a
grievous
dearth
over
the
whole
of
lydia
and
the
lydians
for
a
time
continued
to
endure
it
but
afterwards
as
it
did
not
cease
they
sought
for
remedies
and
one
devised
one
thing
and
another
of
them
devised
another
thing
and
then
were
discovered
they
say
the
ways
of
playing
with
the
dice
and
the
knucklebones
and
the
ball
and
all
the
other
games
excepting
draughts
for
the
discovery
of
this
last
is
not
claimed
by
the
lydians
these
games
they
invented
as
a
resource
against
the
famine
and
thus
they
used
to
do
one
of
the
days
they
would
play
games
all
the
time
in
order
that
they
might
not
feel
the
want
of
food
and
on
the
next
they
ceased
from
their
games
and
had
food
and
thus
they
went
on
for
eighteen
years
as
however
the
evil
did
not
slacken
but
pressed
upon
them
ever
more
and
more
therefore
their
king
divided
the
whole
lydian
people
into
two
parts
and
he
appointed
by
lot
one
part
to
remain
and
the
other
to
go
forth
from
the
land
and
the
king
appointed
himself
to
be
over
that
one
of
the
parts
which
had
the
lot
to
stay
in
the
land
and
his
son
to
be
over
that
which
was
departing
and
the
name
of
his
son
was
tyrsenos
so
the
one
party
of
them
having
obtained
the
lot
to
go
forth
from
the
land
went
down
to
the
sea
at
smyrna
and
built
ships
for
themselves
wherein
they
placed
all
the
movable
goods
which
they
had
and
sailed
away
to
seek
for
means
of
living
and
a
land
to
dwell
in
until
after
passing
by
many
nations
they
came
at
last
to
the
land
of
the
ombricans
and
there
they
founded
cities
and
dwell
up
to
the
present
time
and
changing
their
name
they
were
called
after
the
king
son
who
led
them
out
from
home
not
lydians
but
tyrsenians
taking
the
name
from
him
the
lydians
then
had
been
made
subject
to
the
persians
as
i
say
and
after
this
our
history
proceeds
to
inquire
about
cyrus
who
he
was
that
destroyed
the
empire
of
croesus
and
about
the
persians
in
what
manner
they
obtained
the
lead
of
asia
following
then
the
report
of
some
of
the
persians
i
mean
who
do
not
desire
to
glorify
the
history
of
cyrus
but
to
speak
that
which
is
in
fact
true
to
their
report
i
say
i
shall
write
but
i
could
set
forth
also
the
other
forms
of
the
story
in
three
several
ways
the
assyrians
ruled
upper
asia
for
five
hundred
and
twenty
years
and
from
them
the
medes
were
the
first
who
made
revolt
these
having
fought
for
their
freedom
with
the
assyrians
proved
themselves
good
men
and
thus
they
pushed
off
the
yoke
of
slavery
from
themselves
and
were
set
free
and
after
them
the
other
nations
also
did
the
same
as
the
medes
and
when
all
on
the
continent
were
thus
independent
they
ed
again
to
despotic
rule
as
follows
there
appeared
among
the
medes
a
man
of
great
ability
whose
name
was
deïokes
and
this
man
was
the
son
of
phraortes
this
deïokes
having
formed
a
desire
for
despotic
power
did
thus
the
medes
dwelt
in
separate
villages
he
being
even
before
that
time
of
great
repute
in
his
own
village
set
himself
to
practise
just
dealing
much
more
and
with
greater
zeal
than
before
and
this
he
did
although
there
was
much
lawlessness
throughout
the
whole
of
media
and
although
he
knew
that
injustice
is
ever
at
feud
with
justice
and
the
medes
of
the
same
village
seeing
his
manners
chose
him
for
their
judge
so
he
since
he
was
aiming
at
power
was
upright
and
just
and
doing
thus
he
had
no
little
praise
from
his
insomuch
that
those
of
the
other
villages
learning
that
deïokes
was
a
man
who
more
than
all
others
gave
decision
rightly
whereas
before
this
they
had
been
wont
to
suffer
from
unjust
judgments
themselves
also
when
they
heard
it
came
gladly
to
deïokes
to
have
their
causes
determined
and
at
last
they
trusted
the
business
to
no
one
else
then
as
more
and
more
continually
kept
coming
to
him
because
men
learnt
that
his
decisions
proved
to
be
according
to
the
truth
deïokes
perceiving
that
everything
was
referred
to
himself
would
no
longer
sit
in
the
place
where
he
used
formerly
to
sit
in
public
to
determine
causes
and
said
that
he
would
determine
causes
no
more
for
it
was
not
profitable
for
him
to
neglect
his
own
affairs
and
to
determine
causes
for
his
neighbours
all
through
the
day
so
then
since
robbery
and
lawlessness
prevailed
even
much
more
in
the
villages
than
they
did
before
the
medes
having
assembled
together
in
one
place
considered
with
one
another
and
spoke
about
the
state
in
which
they
were
and
i
suppose
the
friends
of
deïokes
spoke
much
to
this
effect
seeing
that
we
are
not
able
to
dwell
in
the
land
under
the
present
order
of
things
let
us
set
up
a
king
from
among
ourselves
and
thus
the
land
will
be
well
governed
and
we
ourselves
shall
turn
to
labour
and
shall
not
be
ruined
by
lawlessness
by
some
such
words
as
these
they
persuaded
themselves
to
have
a
king
and
when
they
straightway
proposed
the
question
whom
they
should
set
up
to
be
king
deïokes
was
much
put
forward
and
commended
by
every
one
until
at
last
they
agreed
that
he
should
be
their
king
and
he
bade
them
build
for
him
a
palace
worthy
of
the
royal
dignity
and
strengthen
him
with
a
guard
of
spearmen
and
the
medes
did
so
for
they
built
him
a
large
and
strong
palace
in
that
part
of
the
land
which
he
told
them
and
they
allowed
him
to
select
spearmen
from
all
the
medes
and
when
he
had
obtained
the
rule
over
them
he
compelled
the
medes
to
make
one
fortified
city
and
pay
chief
attention
to
this
having
less
regard
to
the
other
cities
and
as
the
medes
obeyed
him
in
this
also
he
built
large
and
strong
walls
those
which
are
now
called
agbatana
standing
in
circles
one
within
the
other
and
this
wall
is
so
contrived
that
one
circle
is
higher
than
the
next
by
the
height
of
the
battlements
alone
and
to
some
extent
i
suppose
the
nature
of
the
ground
seeing
that
it
is
on
a
hill
assists
towards
this
end
but
much
more
was
it
produced
by
art
since
the
circles
are
in
all
seven
in
number
and
within
the
last
circle
are
the
royal
palace
and
the
the
largest
of
these
walls
is
in
size
about
equal
to
the
circuit
of
the
wall
round
athens
and
of
the
first
circle
the
battlements
are
white
of
the
second
black
of
the
third
crimson
of
the
fourth
blue
of
the
fifth
red
thus
are
the
battlements
of
all
the
circles
coloured
with
various
tints
and
the
two
last
have
their
battlements
one
of
them
overlaid
with
silver
and
the
other
with
gold
these
walls
then
deïokes
built
for
himself
and
round
his
own
palace
and
the
people
he
commanded
to
dwell
round
about
the
wall
and
after
all
was
built
deïokes
established
the
rule
which
he
was
the
first
to
establish
ordaining
that
none
should
enter
into
the
presence
of
the
king
but
that
they
deal
with
him
always
through
messengers
and
that
the
king
should
be
seen
by
no
one
and
moreover
that
to
laugh
or
to
spit
in
presence
is
unseemly
and
this
last
for
every
one
without
exception
now
he
surrounded
himself
with
this
state
to
the
end
that
his
fellows
who
had
been
brought
up
with
him
and
were
of
no
meaner
family
nor
behind
him
in
manly
virtue
might
not
be
grieved
by
seeing
him
and
make
plots
against
him
but
that
being
unseen
by
them
he
might
be
thought
to
be
of
different
mould
having
set
these
things
in
order
and
strengthened
himself
in
his
despotism
he
was
severe
in
preserving
justice
and
the
people
used
to
write
down
their
causes
and
send
them
in
to
his
presence
and
he
determined
the
questions
which
were
brought
in
to
him
and
sent
them
out
again
thus
he
used
to
do
about
the
judgment
of
causes
and
he
also
took
order
for
this
that
is
to
say
if
he
heard
that
any
one
was
behaving
in
an
unruly
manner
he
sent
for
him
and
punished
him
according
as
each
act
of
wrong
deserved
and
he
had
watchers
and
listeners
about
all
the
land
over
which
he
ruled
deïokes
then
united
the
median
race
alone
and
was
ruler
of
this
and
of
the
medes
there
are
the
tribes
which
here
follow
namely
busai
paretakenians
struchates
arizantians
budians
magians
the
tribes
of
the
medes
are
so
many
in
number
now
the
son
of
deïokes
was
phraortes
who
when
deïokes
was
dead
having
been
king
for
years
received
the
power
in
succession
and
having
received
it
he
was
not
satisfied
to
be
ruler
of
the
medes
alone
but
marched
upon
the
persians
and
attacking
them
first
before
others
he
made
these
first
subject
to
the
medes
after
this
being
ruler
of
these
two
nations
and
both
of
them
strong
he
proceeded
to
subdue
asia
going
from
one
nation
to
another
until
at
last
he
marched
against
the
assyrians
those
assyrians
i
mean
who
dwelt
at
nineveh
and
who
formerly
had
been
rulers
of
the
whole
but
at
that
time
they
were
left
without
support
their
allies
having
revolted
from
them
though
at
home
they
were
prosperous
enough
phraortes
marched
i
say
against
these
and
was
both
himself
slain
after
he
had
reigned
years
and
the
greater
part
of
his
army
was
destroyed
when
phraortes
had
brought
his
life
to
an
end
kyaxares
the
son
of
phraortes
the
son
of
deïokes
received
the
power
this
king
is
said
to
have
been
yet
much
more
warlike
than
his
forefathers
and
he
first
banded
the
men
of
asia
into
separate
divisions
that
is
to
say
he
first
arrayed
apart
from
one
another
the
spearmen
and
the
archers
and
the
horsemen
for
before
that
time
they
were
all
mingled
together
without
distinction
this
was
he
who
fought
with
the
lydians
when
the
day
became
night
as
they
fought
and
who
also
united
under
his
rule
the
whole
of
asia
above
the
river
halys
and
having
gathered
together
all
his
subjects
he
marched
upon
nineveh
to
avenge
his
father
and
also
because
he
desired
to
conquer
that
city
and
when
he
had
fought
a
battle
with
the
assyrians
and
had
defeated
them
while
he
was
sitting
down
before
nineveh
there
came
upon
him
a
great
army
of
scythians
and
the
leader
of
them
was
madyas
the
son
of
protohyas
king
of
the
scythians
these
had
invaded
asia
after
driving
the
kimmerians
out
of
europe
and
in
pursuit
of
them
as
they
fled
they
had
come
to
the
land
of
media
now
from
the
maiotian
lake
to
the
river
phasis
and
to
the
land
of
the
colchians
is
a
journey
of
thirty
days
for
one
without
encumbrance
and
from
colchis
it
is
not
far
to
pass
over
to
media
for
there
is
only
one
nation
between
them
the
saspeirians
and
passing
by
this
nation
you
are
in
media
however
the
scythians
did
not
make
their
invasion
by
this
way
but
turned
aside
from
it
to
go
by
the
upper
road
which
is
much
longer
keeping
mount
caucasus
on
their
right
hand
then
the
medes
fought
with
the
scythians
and
having
been
worsted
in
the
battle
they
lost
their
power
and
the
scythians
obtained
rule
over
all
asia
thence
they
went
on
to
invade
egypt
and
when
they
were
in
syria
which
is
called
palestine
psammetichos
king
of
egypt
met
them
and
by
gifts
and
entreaties
he
turned
them
from
their
purpose
so
that
they
should
not
advance
any
further
and
as
they
retreated
when
they
came
to
the
city
of
ascalon
in
syria
most
of
the
scythians
passed
through
without
doing
any
damage
but
a
few
of
them
who
had
stayed
behind
plundered
the
temple
of
aphrodite
urania
now
this
temple
as
i
find
by
inquiry
is
the
most
ancient
of
all
the
temples
which
belong
to
this
goddess
for
the
temple
in
cyprus
was
founded
from
this
as
the
people
of
cyprus
themselves
report
and
it
was
the
phenicians
who
founded
the
temple
in
kythera
coming
from
this
land
of
syria
so
these
scythians
who
had
plundered
the
temple
at
ascalon
and
their
descendants
for
ever
were
smitten
by
the
divinity
with
a
disease
which
made
them
women
instead
of
men
and
the
scythians
say
that
it
was
for
this
reason
that
they
were
diseased
and
that
for
this
reason
travellers
who
visit
scythia
now
see
among
them
the
affection
of
those
who
by
the
scythians
are
called
enareës
for
years
then
the
scythians
were
rulers
of
asia
and
by
their
unruliness
and
reckless
behaviour
everything
was
ruined
for
on
the
one
hand
they
exacted
that
in
tribute
from
each
people
which
they
laid
upon
them
and
apart
from
the
tribute
they
rode
about
and
carried
off
by
force
the
possessions
of
each
tribe
then
kyaxares
with
the
medes
having
invited
the
greater
number
of
them
to
a
banquet
made
them
drunk
and
slew
them
and
thus
the
medes
recovered
their
power
and
had
rule
over
the
same
nations
as
before
and
they
also
took
nineveh
manner
how
it
was
taken
i
shall
set
forth
in
another
history
made
the
assyrians
subject
to
them
excepting
only
the
land
of
babylon
after
this
kyaxares
died
having
reigned
forty
years
including
those
years
during
which
the
scythians
had
rule
and
astyages
son
of
kyaxares
received
from
him
the
kingdom
to
him
was
born
a
daughter
whom
he
named
mandane
and
in
his
sleep
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
passed
from
her
so
much
water
as
to
fill
his
city
and
also
to
flood
the
whole
of
asia
this
dream
he
delivered
over
to
the
magian
interpreters
of
dreams
and
when
he
heard
from
them
the
truth
at
each
point
he
became
afraid
and
afterwards
when
this
mandane
was
of
an
age
to
have
a
husband
he
did
not
give
her
in
marriage
to
any
one
of
the
medes
who
were
his
peers
because
he
feared
the
vision
but
he
gave
her
to
a
persian
named
cambyses
whom
he
found
to
be
of
a
good
descent
and
of
a
quiet
disposition
counting
him
to
be
in
station
much
below
a
mede
of
middle
rank
and
when
mandane
was
married
to
cambyses
in
the
first
year
astyages
saw
another
vision
it
seemed
to
him
that
from
the
womb
of
this
daughter
a
vine
grew
and
this
vine
overspread
the
whole
of
asia
having
seen
this
vision
and
delivered
it
to
the
interpreters
of
dreams
he
sent
for
his
daughter
being
then
with
child
to
come
from
the
land
of
the
persians
and
when
she
had
come
he
kept
watch
over
her
desiring
to
destroy
that
which
should
be
born
of
her
for
the
magian
interpreters
of
dreams
signified
to
him
that
the
offspring
of
his
daughter
should
be
king
in
his
room
astyages
then
desiring
to
guard
against
this
when
cyrus
was
born
called
harpagos
a
man
who
was
of
kin
near
him
and
whom
he
trusted
above
all
the
other
medes
and
had
made
him
manager
of
all
his
affairs
and
to
him
he
said
as
follows
neglect
not
by
any
means
harpagos
the
matter
which
i
shall
lay
upon
thee
to
do
and
beware
lest
thou
set
me
aside
and
choosing
the
advantage
of
others
instead
bring
thyself
afterwards
to
destruction
take
the
child
which
mandane
bore
and
carry
it
to
thy
house
and
slay
it
and
afterwards
bury
it
in
whatsoever
manner
thou
thyself
desirest
to
this
he
made
answer
o
king
never
yet
in
any
past
time
didst
thou
discern
in
me
an
offence
against
thee
and
i
keep
watch
over
myself
also
with
a
view
to
the
time
that
comes
after
that
i
may
not
commit
any
error
towards
thee
if
it
is
indeed
thy
pleasure
that
this
should
so
be
done
my
service
at
least
must
be
fitly
rendered
thus
he
made
answer
and
when
the
child
had
been
delivered
to
him
adorned
as
for
death
harpagos
went
weeping
to
his
wife
all
the
words
which
had
been
spoken
by
astyages
and
she
said
to
him
now
therefore
what
is
it
in
thy
mind
to
do
and
he
made
answer
not
according
as
astyages
enjoined
for
not
even
if
he
shall
come
to
be
yet
more
out
of
his
senses
and
more
mad
than
he
now
is
will
i
agree
to
his
will
or
serve
him
in
such
a
murder
as
this
and
for
many
reasons
i
will
not
slay
the
child
first
because
he
is
a
kin
to
me
and
then
because
astyages
is
old
and
without
male
issue
and
if
after
he
is
dead
the
power
shall
come
through
me
does
not
the
greatest
of
dangers
then
await
me
to
secure
me
this
child
must
die
but
one
of
the
servants
of
astyages
must
be
the
slayer
of
it
and
not
one
of
mine
thus
he
spoke
and
straightway
sent
a
messenger
to
that
one
of
the
herdsmen
of
astyages
who
he
knew
fed
his
herds
on
the
pastures
which
were
most
suitable
for
his
purpose
and
on
the
mountains
most
haunted
by
wild
beasts
the
name
of
this
man
was
mitradates
and
he
was
married
to
one
who
was
his
and
the
name
of
the
woman
to
whom
he
was
married
was
kyno
in
the
tongue
of
the
hellenes
and
in
the
median
tongue
spaco
for
what
the
hellenes
call
kyna
bitch
the
medes
call
spaca
now
it
was
on
the
skirts
of
the
mountains
that
this
herdsman
had
his
from
agbatana
towards
the
north
wind
and
towards
the
euxine
sea
for
here
in
the
direction
of
the
saspeirians
the
median
land
is
very
mountainous
and
lofty
and
thickly
covered
with
forests
but
the
rest
of
the
land
of
media
is
all
level
plain
so
when
this
herdsman
came
being
summoned
with
much
urgency
harpagos
said
these
words
astyages
bids
thee
take
this
child
and
place
it
on
the
most
desolate
part
of
the
mountains
so
that
it
may
perish
as
quickly
as
possible
and
he
bade
me
to
say
that
if
thou
do
not
kill
it
but
in
any
way
shalt
preserve
it
from
death
he
will
slay
thee
by
the
most
evil
kind
of
destruction
and
i
have
been
appointed
to
see
that
the
child
is
laid
forth
having
heard
this
and
having
taken
up
the
child
the
herdsman
went
back
by
the
way
he
came
and
arrived
at
his
dwelling
and
his
wife
also
as
it
seems
having
been
every
day
on
the
point
of
bearing
a
child
by
a
providential
chance
brought
her
child
to
birth
just
at
that
time
when
the
herdsman
was
gone
to
the
city
and
both
were
in
anxiety
each
for
the
other
the
man
having
fear
about
the
of
his
wife
and
the
woman
about
the
cause
why
harpagos
had
sent
to
summon
her
husband
not
having
been
wont
to
do
so
aforetime
so
as
soon
as
he
ed
and
stood
before
her
the
woman
seeing
him
again
beyond
her
hopes
was
the
first
to
speak
and
asked
him
for
what
purpose
harpagos
had
sent
for
him
so
urgently
and
he
said
wife
when
i
came
to
the
city
i
saw
and
heard
that
which
i
would
i
had
not
seen
and
which
i
should
wish
had
never
chanced
to
those
whom
we
serve
for
the
house
of
harpagos
was
all
full
of
mourning
and
i
being
astonished
thereat
went
within
and
as
soon
as
i
entered
i
saw
laid
out
to
view
an
infant
child
gasping
for
breath
and
screaming
which
was
adorned
with
gold
ornaments
and
embroidered
clothing
and
when
harpagos
saw
me
he
bade
me
forthwith
to
take
up
the
child
and
carry
it
away
and
lay
it
on
that
part
of
the
mountains
which
is
most
haunted
by
wild
beasts
saying
that
it
was
astyages
who
laid
this
task
upon
me
and
using
to
me
many
threats
if
i
should
fail
to
do
this
and
i
took
it
up
and
bore
it
away
supposing
that
it
was
the
child
of
some
one
of
the
servants
of
the
house
for
never
could
i
have
supposed
whence
it
really
was
but
i
marvelled
to
see
it
adorned
with
gold
and
raiment
and
i
marvelled
also
because
mourning
was
made
for
it
openly
in
the
house
of
harpagos
and
straightway
as
we
went
by
the
road
i
learnt
the
whole
of
the
matter
from
the
servant
who
went
with
me
out
of
the
city
and
placed
in
my
hands
the
babe
namely
that
it
was
in
truth
the
son
of
mandane
the
daughter
of
astyages
and
of
cambyses
the
son
of
cyrus
and
that
astyages
bade
slay
it
and
now
here
it
is
and
as
he
said
this
the
herdsman
uncovered
it
and
showed
it
to
her
and
she
seeing
that
the
child
was
large
and
of
fair
form
wept
and
clung
to
the
knees
of
her
husband
beseeching
him
by
no
means
to
lay
it
forth
but
he
said
that
he
could
not
do
otherwise
than
so
for
watchers
would
come
backwards
and
forwards
sent
by
harpagos
to
see
that
this
was
done
and
he
would
perish
by
a
miserable
death
if
he
should
fail
to
do
this
and
as
she
could
not
after
all
persuade
her
husband
the
wife
next
said
as
follows
since
then
i
am
unable
to
persuade
thee
not
to
lay
it
forth
do
thou
this
which
i
shall
tell
thee
if
indeed
it
needs
must
be
seen
laid
forth
i
also
have
borne
a
child
but
i
have
borne
it
dead
take
this
and
expose
it
and
let
us
rear
the
child
of
the
daughter
of
astyages
as
if
it
were
our
own
thus
thou
wilt
not
be
found
out
doing
a
wrong
to
those
whom
we
serve
nor
shall
we
have
taken
ill
counsel
for
ourselves
for
the
dead
child
will
obtain
a
royal
burial
and
the
surviving
one
will
not
lose
his
life
to
the
herdsman
it
seemed
that
the
case
standing
thus
his
wife
spoke
well
and
forthwith
he
did
so
the
child
which
he
was
bearing
to
put
to
death
this
he
delivered
to
his
wife
and
his
own
which
was
dead
he
took
and
placed
in
the
chest
in
which
he
had
been
bearing
the
other
and
having
adorned
it
with
all
the
adornment
of
the
other
child
he
bore
it
to
the
most
desolate
part
of
the
mountains
and
placed
it
there
and
when
the
third
day
came
after
the
child
had
been
laid
forth
the
herdsman
went
to
the
city
leaving
one
of
his
to
watch
there
and
when
he
came
to
the
house
of
harpagos
he
said
that
he
was
ready
to
display
the
dead
body
of
the
child
and
harpagos
sent
the
most
trusted
of
his
spearmen
and
through
them
he
saw
and
buried
the
herdsman
child
this
then
had
had
burial
but
him
who
was
afterwards
called
cyrus
the
wife
of
the
herdsman
had
received
and
was
bringing
him
up
giving
him
no
doubt
some
other
name
not
cyrus
and
when
the
boy
was
ten
years
old
it
happened
with
regard
to
him
as
follows
and
this
made
him
known
he
was
playing
in
the
village
in
which
were
stalls
for
oxen
he
was
playing
there
i
say
with
other
boys
of
his
age
in
the
road
and
the
boys
in
their
play
chose
as
their
king
this
one
who
was
called
the
son
of
the
herdsman
and
he
set
some
of
them
to
build
palaces
and
others
to
be
spearmen
of
his
guard
and
one
of
them
no
doubt
he
appointed
to
be
the
eye
of
the
king
and
to
one
he
gave
the
office
of
bearing
the
messages
appointing
a
work
for
each
one
severally
now
one
of
these
boys
who
was
playing
with
the
rest
the
son
of
artembares
a
man
of
repute
among
the
medes
did
not
do
that
which
cyrus
appointed
him
to
do
therefore
cyrus
bade
the
other
boys
seize
him
hand
and
foot
and
when
they
obeyed
his
command
he
dealt
with
the
boy
very
roughly
scourging
him
but
he
so
soon
as
he
was
let
go
being
made
much
more
angry
because
he
considered
that
he
had
been
treated
with
indignity
went
down
to
the
city
and
complained
to
his
father
of
the
treatment
which
he
had
met
with
from
cyrus
calling
him
not
cyrus
for
this
was
not
yet
his
name
but
the
son
of
the
herdsman
of
astyages
and
artembares
in
the
anger
of
the
moment
went
at
once
to
astyages
taking
the
boy
with
him
and
he
declared
that
he
had
suffered
things
that
were
unfitting
and
said
o
king
by
thy
slave
the
son
of
a
herdsman
we
have
been
thus
outraged
showing
him
the
shoulders
of
his
son
and
astyages
having
heard
and
seen
this
wishing
to
punish
the
boy
to
avenge
the
honour
of
artembares
sent
for
both
the
herdsman
and
his
son
and
when
both
were
present
astyages
looked
at
cyrus
and
said
didst
thou
dare
being
the
son
of
so
mean
a
father
as
this
to
treat
with
such
unseemly
insult
the
son
of
this
man
who
is
first
in
my
favour
and
he
replied
thus
master
i
did
so
to
him
with
right
for
the
boys
of
the
village
of
whom
he
also
was
one
in
their
play
set
me
up
as
king
over
them
for
i
appeared
to
them
most
fitted
for
this
place
now
the
other
boys
did
what
i
commanded
them
but
this
one
disobeyed
and
paid
no
regard
until
at
last
he
received
the
punishment
due
if
therefore
for
this
i
am
worthy
to
suffer
any
evil
here
i
stand
before
thee
while
the
boy
thus
spoke
there
came
upon
astyages
a
sense
of
recognition
of
him
and
the
lineaments
of
his
face
seemed
to
him
to
resemble
his
own
and
his
answer
appeared
to
be
somewhat
over
free
for
his
station
while
the
time
of
the
laying
forth
seemed
to
agree
with
the
age
of
the
boy
being
struck
with
amazement
by
these
things
for
a
time
he
was
speechless
and
having
at
length
with
difficulty
recovered
himself
he
said
desiring
to
dismiss
artembares
in
order
that
he
might
get
the
herdsman
by
himself
alone
and
examine
him
artembares
i
will
so
order
these
things
that
thou
and
thy
son
shall
have
no
cause
to
find
fault
and
so
he
dismissed
artembares
and
the
servants
upon
the
command
of
astyages
led
cyrus
within
and
when
the
herdsman
was
left
alone
with
the
king
astyages
being
alone
with
him
asked
whence
he
had
received
the
boy
and
who
it
was
who
had
delivered
the
boy
to
him
and
the
herdsman
said
that
he
was
his
own
son
and
that
the
mother
was
living
with
him
still
as
his
wife
but
astyages
said
that
he
was
not
well
advised
in
desiring
to
be
brought
to
extreme
necessity
and
as
he
said
this
he
made
a
sign
to
the
spearmen
of
his
guard
to
seize
him
so
he
as
he
was
being
led
away
to
the
torture
then
declared
the
story
as
it
really
was
and
beginning
from
the
beginning
he
went
through
the
whole
telling
the
truth
about
it
and
finally
ended
with
entreaties
asking
that
he
would
grant
him
pardon
so
when
the
herdsman
had
made
known
the
truth
astyages
now
cared
less
about
him
but
with
harpagos
he
was
very
greatly
displeased
and
bade
his
spearmen
summon
him
and
when
harpagos
came
astyages
asked
him
thus
by
what
death
harpagos
didst
thou
destroy
the
child
whom
i
delivered
to
thee
born
of
my
daughter
and
harpagos
seeing
that
the
herdsman
was
in
the
king
palace
turned
not
to
any
false
way
of
speech
lest
he
should
be
convicted
and
found
out
but
said
as
follows
o
king
so
soon
as
i
received
the
child
i
took
counsel
and
considered
how
i
should
do
according
to
thy
mind
and
how
without
offence
to
thy
command
i
might
not
be
guilty
of
murder
against
thy
daughter
and
against
thyself
i
did
therefore
thus
called
this
herdsman
and
delivered
the
child
to
him
saying
first
that
thou
wert
he
who
bade
him
slay
in
this
at
least
i
did
not
lie
for
thou
didst
so
command
i
delivered
it
i
say
to
this
man
commanding
him
to
place
it
upon
a
desolate
mountain
and
to
stay
by
it
and
watch
it
until
it
should
die
threatening
him
with
all
kinds
of
punishment
if
he
should
fail
to
accomplish
this
and
when
he
had
done
that
which
was
ordered
and
the
child
was
dead
i
sent
the
most
trusted
of
my
eunuchs
and
through
them
i
saw
and
buried
the
child
thus
o
king
it
happened
about
this
matter
and
the
child
had
this
death
which
i
say
so
harpagos
declared
the
truth
and
astyages
concealed
the
anger
which
he
kept
against
him
for
that
which
had
come
to
pass
and
first
he
related
the
matter
over
again
to
harpagos
according
as
he
had
been
told
it
by
the
herdsman
and
afterwards
when
it
had
been
thus
repeated
by
him
he
ended
by
saying
that
the
child
was
alive
and
that
that
which
had
come
to
pass
was
well
for
continued
he
i
was
greatly
troubled
by
that
which
had
been
done
to
this
child
and
i
thought
it
no
light
thing
that
i
had
been
made
at
variance
with
my
daughter
therefore
consider
that
this
is
a
happy
change
of
fortune
and
first
send
thy
son
to
be
with
the
boy
who
is
newly
come
and
then
seeing
that
i
intend
to
make
a
sacrifice
of
thanksgiving
for
the
preservation
of
the
boy
to
those
gods
to
whom
that
honour
belongs
be
here
thyself
to
dine
with
me
when
harpagos
heard
this
he
did
reverence
and
thought
it
a
great
matter
that
his
offence
had
turned
out
for
his
profit
and
moreover
that
he
had
been
invited
to
dinner
with
happy
augury
and
so
he
went
to
his
house
and
having
entered
it
straightway
he
sent
forth
his
son
for
he
had
one
only
son
of
about
thirteen
years
old
bidding
him
go
to
the
palace
of
astyages
and
do
whatsoever
the
king
should
command
and
he
himself
being
overjoyed
told
his
wife
that
which
had
befallen
him
but
astyages
when
the
son
of
harpagos
arrived
cut
his
throat
and
divided
him
limb
from
limb
and
having
roasted
some
pieces
of
the
flesh
and
boiled
others
he
caused
them
to
be
dressed
for
eating
and
kept
them
ready
and
when
the
time
arrived
for
dinner
and
the
other
guests
were
present
and
also
harpagos
then
before
the
other
guests
and
before
astyages
himself
were
placed
tables
covered
with
flesh
of
sheep
but
before
harpagos
was
placed
the
flesh
of
his
own
son
all
but
the
head
and
the
hands
and
the
feet
and
these
were
laid
aside
covered
up
in
a
basket
then
when
it
seemed
that
harpagos
was
satisfied
with
food
astyages
asked
him
whether
he
had
been
pleased
with
the
banquet
and
when
harpagos
said
that
he
had
been
very
greatly
pleased
they
who
had
been
commanded
to
do
this
brought
to
him
the
head
of
his
son
covered
up
together
with
the
hands
and
the
feet
and
standing
near
they
bade
harpagos
uncover
and
take
of
them
that
which
he
desired
so
when
harpagos
obeyed
and
uncovered
he
saw
the
remains
of
his
son
and
seeing
them
he
was
not
overcome
with
amazement
but
contained
himself
and
astyages
asked
him
whether
he
perceived
of
what
animal
he
had
been
eating
the
flesh
and
he
said
that
he
perceived
and
that
whatsoever
the
king
might
do
was
well
pleasing
to
him
thus
having
made
answer
and
taking
up
the
parts
of
the
flesh
which
still
remained
he
went
to
his
house
and
after
that
i
suppose
he
would
gather
all
the
parts
together
and
bury
them
on
harpagos
astyages
laid
this
penalty
and
about
cyrus
he
took
thought
and
summoned
the
same
men
of
the
magians
who
had
given
judgment
about
his
dream
in
the
manner
which
has
been
said
and
when
they
came
astyages
asked
how
they
had
given
judgment
about
his
vision
and
they
spoke
according
to
the
same
manner
saying
that
the
child
must
have
become
king
if
he
had
lived
on
and
had
not
died
before
he
made
answer
to
them
thus
the
child
is
alive
and
not
dead
and
while
he
was
dwelling
in
the
country
the
boys
of
the
village
appointed
him
king
and
he
performed
completely
all
those
things
which
they
do
who
are
really
kings
for
he
exercised
rule
appointed
to
their
places
spearmen
of
the
guard
and
doorkeepers
and
bearers
of
messages
and
all
else
now
therefore
to
what
does
it
seem
to
you
that
these
things
tend
the
magians
said
if
the
child
is
still
alive
and
became
king
without
any
arrangement
be
thou
confident
concerning
him
and
have
good
courage
for
he
shall
not
be
ruler
again
the
second
time
since
some
even
of
our
oracles
have
had
but
small
results
and
that
at
least
which
has
to
do
with
dreams
comes
often
in
the
end
to
a
feeble
accomplishment
astyages
made
answer
in
these
words
i
myself
also
o
magians
am
most
disposed
to
believe
that
this
is
so
namely
that
since
the
boy
was
named
king
the
dream
has
had
its
fulfilment
and
that
this
boy
is
no
longer
a
source
of
danger
to
me
nevertheless
give
counsel
to
me
having
well
considered
what
is
likely
to
be
most
safe
both
for
my
house
and
for
you
replying
to
this
the
magians
said
to
us
also
o
king
it
is
of
great
consequence
that
thy
rule
should
stand
firm
for
in
the
other
case
it
is
transferred
to
strangers
coming
round
to
this
boy
who
is
a
persian
and
we
being
medes
are
made
slaves
and
become
of
no
account
in
the
eyes
of
the
persians
seeing
that
we
are
of
different
race
but
while
thou
art
established
as
our
king
who
art
one
of
our
own
nation
we
both
have
our
share
of
rule
and
receive
great
honours
from
thee
thus
then
we
must
by
all
means
have
a
care
of
thee
and
of
thy
rule
and
now
if
we
saw
in
this
anything
to
cause
fear
we
would
declare
all
to
thee
beforehand
but
as
the
dream
has
had
its
issue
in
a
trifling
manner
both
we
ourselves
are
of
good
cheer
and
we
exhort
thee
to
be
so
likewise
and
as
for
this
boy
send
him
away
from
before
thine
eyes
to
the
persians
and
to
his
parents
when
he
heard
this
astyages
rejoiced
and
calling
cyrus
spoke
to
him
thus
my
son
i
did
thee
wrong
by
reason
of
a
vision
of
a
dream
which
has
not
come
to
pass
but
thou
art
yet
alive
by
thine
own
destiny
now
therefore
go
in
peace
to
the
land
of
the
persians
and
i
will
send
with
thee
men
to
conduct
thee
and
when
thou
art
come
thither
thou
shalt
find
a
father
and
a
mother
not
after
the
fashion
of
mitradates
the
herdsman
and
his
wife
thus
having
spoken
astyages
sent
cyrus
away
and
when
he
had
ed
and
come
to
the
house
of
cambyses
his
parents
received
him
and
after
that
when
they
learnt
who
he
was
they
welcomed
him
not
a
little
for
they
had
supposed
without
doubt
that
their
son
had
perished
straightway
after
his
birth
and
they
inquired
in
what
manner
he
had
survived
and
he
told
them
saying
that
before
this
he
had
not
known
but
had
been
utterly
in
error
on
the
way
however
he
had
learnt
all
his
own
fortunes
for
he
had
supposed
without
doubt
that
he
was
the
son
of
the
herdsman
of
astyages
but
since
his
journey
from
the
city
began
he
had
learnt
the
whole
story
from
those
who
conducted
him
and
he
said
that
he
had
been
brought
up
by
the
wife
of
the
herdsman
and
continued
to
praise
her
throughout
so
that
kyno
was
the
chief
person
in
his
tale
and
his
parents
took
up
this
name
from
him
and
in
order
that
their
son
might
be
thought
by
the
persians
to
have
been
preserved
in
a
more
supernatural
manner
they
set
on
foot
a
report
that
cyrus
when
he
was
exposed
had
been
reared
by
a
bitch
and
from
that
source
has
come
this
report
then
as
cyrus
grew
to
be
a
man
being
of
all
those
of
his
age
the
most
courageous
and
the
best
beloved
harpagos
sought
to
become
his
friend
and
sent
him
gifts
because
he
desired
to
take
vengeance
on
astyages
for
he
saw
not
how
from
himself
who
was
in
a
private
station
punishment
should
come
upon
astyages
but
when
he
saw
cyrus
growing
up
he
endeavoured
to
make
him
an
ally
finding
a
likeness
between
the
fortunes
of
cyrus
and
his
own
and
even
before
that
time
he
had
effected
something
for
astyages
being
harsh
towards
the
medes
harpagos
communicated
severally
with
the
chief
men
of
the
medes
and
persuaded
them
that
they
must
make
cyrus
their
leader
and
cause
astyages
to
cease
from
being
king
when
he
had
effected
this
and
when
all
was
ready
then
harpagos
wishing
to
make
known
his
design
to
cyrus
who
lived
among
the
persians
could
do
it
no
other
way
seeing
that
the
roads
were
watched
but
devised
a
scheme
as
follows
made
ready
a
hare
and
having
cut
open
its
belly
but
without
pulling
off
any
of
the
fur
he
put
into
it
just
as
it
was
a
piece
of
paper
having
written
upon
it
that
which
he
thought
good
and
then
he
sewed
up
again
the
belly
of
the
hare
and
giving
nets
as
if
he
were
a
hunter
to
that
one
of
his
servants
whom
he
trusted
most
he
sent
him
away
to
the
land
of
the
persians
enjoining
him
by
word
of
mouth
to
give
the
hare
to
cyrus
and
to
tell
him
at
the
same
time
to
open
it
with
his
own
hands
and
let
no
one
else
be
present
when
he
did
so
this
then
was
accomplished
and
cyrus
having
received
from
him
the
hare
cut
it
open
and
having
found
within
it
the
paper
he
took
and
read
it
over
and
the
writing
said
this
son
of
cambyses
over
thee
the
gods
keep
guard
for
otherwise
thou
wouldst
never
have
come
to
so
much
good
fortune
do
thou
therefore
take
vengeance
on
astyages
who
is
thy
murderer
for
so
far
as
his
will
is
concerned
thou
art
dead
but
by
the
care
of
the
gods
and
of
me
thou
art
still
alive
and
this
i
think
thou
hast
long
ago
learnt
from
first
to
last
both
how
it
happened
about
thyself
and
also
what
things
i
have
suffered
from
astyages
because
i
did
not
slay
thee
but
gave
thee
to
the
herdsman
if
therefore
thou
wilt
be
guided
by
me
thou
shalt
be
ruler
of
all
that
land
over
which
now
astyages
is
ruler
persuade
the
persians
to
revolt
and
march
any
army
against
the
medes
and
whether
i
shall
be
appointed
leader
of
the
army
against
thee
or
any
other
of
the
medes
who
are
in
repute
thou
hast
what
thou
desirest
for
these
will
be
the
first
to
attempt
to
destroy
astyages
revolting
from
him
and
coming
over
to
thy
party
consider
then
that
here
at
least
all
is
ready
and
therefore
do
this
and
do
it
with
speed
cyrus
having
heard
this
began
to
consider
in
what
manner
he
might
most
skilfully
persuade
the
persians
to
revolt
and
on
consideration
he
found
that
this
was
the
most
convenient
way
and
so
in
fact
he
did
wrote
first
on
a
paper
that
which
he
desired
to
write
and
he
made
an
assembly
of
the
persians
then
he
unfolded
the
paper
and
reading
from
it
said
that
astyages
appointed
him
commander
of
the
persians
and
now
o
persians
he
continued
i
give
you
command
to
come
to
me
each
one
with
a
cyrus
then
proclaimed
this
command
now
there
are
of
the
persians
many
tribes
and
some
of
them
cyrus
gathered
together
and
persuaded
to
revolt
from
the
medes
namely
those
upon
which
all
the
other
persians
depend
the
pasargadai
the
maraphians
and
the
maspians
and
of
these
the
pasargadai
are
the
most
noble
of
whom
also
the
achaimenidai
are
a
clan
whence
are
sprung
the
perseïd
kings
but
other
persian
tribes
there
are
as
follows
panthaliaians
the
derusiaians
and
the
germanians
these
are
all
tillers
of
the
soil
and
the
rest
are
nomad
tribes
namely
the
daoi
mardians
dropicans
and
sagartians
now
there
was
a
certain
region
of
the
persian
land
which
was
overgrown
with
thorns
extending
some
eighteen
or
twenty
furlongs
in
each
direction
and
when
all
had
come
with
that
which
they
had
been
before
commanded
to
bring
cyrus
bade
them
clear
this
region
for
cultivation
within
one
day
and
when
the
persians
had
achieved
the
task
proposed
then
he
bade
them
come
to
him
on
the
next
day
bathed
and
clean
meanwhile
cyrus
having
gathered
together
in
one
place
all
the
flocks
of
goats
and
sheep
and
the
herds
of
cattle
belonging
to
his
father
slaughtered
them
and
prepared
with
them
to
entertain
the
host
of
the
persians
and
moreover
with
wine
and
other
provisions
of
the
most
agreeable
kind
so
when
the
persians
came
on
the
next
day
he
made
them
recline
in
a
meadow
and
feasted
them
and
when
they
had
finished
dinner
cyrus
asked
them
whether
that
which
they
had
on
the
former
day
or
that
which
they
had
now
seemed
to
them
preferable
they
said
that
the
difference
between
them
was
great
for
the
former
day
had
for
them
nothing
but
evil
and
the
present
day
nothing
but
good
taking
up
this
saying
cyrus
proceeded
to
lay
bare
his
whole
design
saying
men
of
the
persians
thus
it
is
with
you
if
ye
will
do
as
i
say
ye
have
these
and
ten
thousand
other
good
things
with
no
servile
labour
but
if
ye
will
not
do
as
i
say
ye
have
labours
like
that
of
yesterday
innumerable
now
therefore
do
as
i
say
and
make
yourselves
free
for
i
seem
to
myself
to
have
been
born
by
providential
fortune
to
take
these
matters
in
hand
and
i
think
that
ye
are
not
worse
men
than
the
medes
either
in
other
matters
or
in
those
which
have
to
do
with
war
consider
then
that
this
is
so
and
make
revolt
from
astyages
forthwith
so
the
persians
having
obtained
a
leader
willingly
attempted
to
set
themselves
free
since
they
had
already
for
a
long
time
been
indignant
to
be
ruled
by
the
medes
but
when
astyages
heard
that
cyrus
was
acting
thus
he
sent
a
messenger
and
summoned
him
and
cyrus
bade
the
messenger
report
to
astyages
that
he
would
be
with
him
sooner
than
he
would
himself
desire
so
astyages
hearing
this
armed
all
the
medes
and
blinded
by
divine
providence
he
appointed
harpagos
to
be
the
leader
of
the
army
forgetting
what
he
had
done
to
him
then
when
the
medes
had
marched
out
and
began
to
fight
with
the
persians
some
of
them
continued
the
battle
namely
those
who
had
not
been
made
partakers
in
the
design
while
others
went
over
to
the
persians
but
the
greater
number
were
wilfully
slack
and
fled
so
when
the
median
army
had
been
shamefully
dispersed
so
soon
as
astyages
heard
of
it
he
said
threatening
cyrus
but
not
even
so
shall
cyrus
at
least
escape
punishment
thus
having
spoken
he
first
impaled
the
magian
interpreters
of
dreams
who
had
persuaded
him
to
let
cyrus
go
and
then
he
armed
those
of
the
medes
youths
and
old
men
who
had
been
left
behind
in
the
city
these
he
led
out
and
having
engaged
battle
with
the
persians
he
was
worsted
and
astyages
himself
was
taken
alive
and
he
lost
also
those
of
the
medes
whom
he
had
led
forth
then
when
astyages
was
a
prisoner
harpagos
came
and
stood
near
him
and
rejoiced
over
him
and
insulted
him
and
besides
other
things
which
he
said
to
grieve
him
he
asked
him
especially
how
it
pleased
him
to
be
a
slave
instead
of
a
king
making
reference
to
that
dinner
at
which
astyages
had
feasted
him
with
the
flesh
of
his
own
son
he
looking
at
him
asked
him
in
whether
he
claimed
the
work
of
cyrus
as
his
own
deed
and
harpagos
said
that
since
he
had
written
the
letter
the
deed
was
justly
his
then
astyages
declared
him
to
be
at
the
same
time
the
most
unskilful
and
the
most
unjust
of
men
the
most
unskilful
because
when
it
was
in
his
power
to
become
king
as
it
was
if
that
which
had
now
been
done
was
really
brought
about
by
him
he
had
conferred
the
chief
power
on
another
and
the
most
unjust
because
on
account
of
that
dinner
he
had
reduced
the
medes
to
slavery
for
if
he
must
needs
confer
the
kingdom
on
some
other
and
not
keep
it
himself
it
was
more
just
to
give
this
good
thing
to
one
of
the
medes
rather
than
to
one
of
the
persians
whereas
now
the
medes
who
were
guiltless
of
this
had
become
slaves
instead
of
masters
and
the
persians
who
formerly
were
slaves
of
the
medes
had
now
become
their
masters
astyages
then
having
been
king
for
years
was
thus
caused
to
cease
from
being
king
and
the
medes
stooped
under
the
yoke
of
the
persians
because
of
his
cruelty
after
they
had
ruled
asia
above
the
river
halys
for
one
hundred
and
years
except
during
that
period
for
which
the
scythians
had
rule
afterwards
however
it
repented
them
that
they
had
done
this
and
they
revolved
from
dareios
and
having
revolted
they
were
subdued
again
being
conquered
in
a
battle
at
this
time
then
i
say
in
the
reign
of
astyages
the
persians
with
cyrus
rose
up
against
the
medes
and
from
that
time
forth
were
rulers
of
asia
but
as
for
astyages
cyrus
did
no
harm
to
him
besides
but
kept
him
with
himself
until
he
died
thus
born
and
bred
cyrus
became
king
and
after
this
he
subdued
croesus
who
was
the
first
to
begin
the
quarrel
as
i
have
before
said
and
having
subdued
him
he
then
became
ruler
of
all
asia
these
are
the
customs
so
far
as
i
know
which
the
persians
practise
and
temples
and
altars
they
do
not
account
it
lawful
to
erect
nay
they
even
charge
with
folly
those
who
do
these
things
and
this
as
it
seems
to
me
because
they
do
not
account
the
gods
to
be
in
the
likeness
of
men
as
do
the
hellenes
but
it
is
their
wont
to
perform
sacrifices
to
zeus
going
up
to
the
most
lofty
of
the
mountains
and
the
whole
circle
of
the
heavens
they
call
zeus
and
they
sacrifice
to
the
sun
and
the
moon
and
the
earth
to
fire
and
to
water
and
to
the
winds
these
are
the
only
gods
to
whom
they
have
sacrificed
ever
from
the
first
but
they
have
learnt
also
to
sacrifice
to
aphrodite
urania
having
learnt
it
both
from
the
assyrians
and
the
arabians
and
the
assyrians
call
aphrodite
mylitta
the
arabians
alitta
and
the
persians
mitra
now
this
is
the
manner
of
sacrifice
for
the
gods
aforesaid
which
is
established
among
the
persians
make
no
altars
neither
do
they
kindle
fire
and
when
they
mean
to
sacrifice
they
use
no
libation
nor
music
of
the
pipe
nor
chaplets
nor
meal
for
sprinkling
but
when
a
man
wishes
to
sacrifice
to
any
one
of
the
gods
he
leads
the
animal
for
sacrifice
to
an
unpolluted
place
and
calls
upon
the
god
having
his
tiara
wreathed
round
generally
with
a
branch
of
myrtle
for
himself
alone
separately
the
man
who
sacrifices
may
not
request
good
things
in
his
prayer
but
he
prays
that
it
may
be
well
with
all
the
persians
and
with
the
king
for
he
himself
also
is
included
of
course
in
the
whole
body
of
persians
and
when
he
has
cut
up
the
victim
into
pieces
and
boiled
the
flesh
he
spreads
a
layer
of
the
freshest
grass
and
especially
clover
upon
which
he
places
forthwith
all
the
pieces
of
flesh
and
when
he
has
placed
them
in
order
a
magian
man
stands
by
them
and
chants
over
them
a
theogony
for
of
this
nature
they
say
that
their
incantation
is
seeing
that
without
a
magian
it
is
not
lawful
for
them
to
make
sacrifices
then
after
waiting
a
short
time
the
sacrificer
carries
away
the
flesh
and
uses
it
for
whatever
purpose
he
pleases
and
of
all
days
their
wont
is
to
honour
most
that
on
which
they
were
born
each
one
on
this
they
think
it
right
to
set
out
a
feast
more
liberal
than
on
other
days
and
in
this
feast
the
wealthier
of
them
set
upon
the
table
an
ox
or
a
horse
or
a
camel
or
an
ass
roasted
whole
in
an
oven
and
the
poor
among
them
set
out
small
animals
in
the
same
way
they
have
few
solid
dishes
but
many
served
up
after
as
dessert
and
these
not
in
a
single
course
and
for
this
reason
the
persians
say
that
the
hellenes
leave
off
dinner
hungry
because
after
dinner
they
have
nothing
worth
mentioning
served
up
as
dessert
whereas
if
any
good
dessert
were
served
up
they
would
not
stop
eating
so
soon
to
they
are
very
much
given
and
it
is
not
permitted
for
a
man
to
vomit
or
to
make
water
in
presence
of
another
thus
do
they
provide
against
these
things
and
they
are
wont
to
deliberate
when
drinking
hard
about
the
most
important
of
their
affairs
and
whatsoever
conclusion
has
pleased
them
in
their
deliberation
this
on
the
next
day
when
they
are
sober
the
master
of
the
house
in
which
they
happen
to
be
when
they
deliberate
lays
before
them
for
discussion
and
if
it
pleases
them
when
they
are
sober
also
they
adopt
it
but
if
it
does
not
please
them
they
let
it
go
and
that
on
which
they
have
had
the
first
deliberation
when
they
are
sober
they
consider
again
when
they
are
drinking
when
they
meet
one
another
in
the
roads
by
this
you
may
discern
whether
those
who
meet
are
of
equal
rank
instead
of
greeting
by
words
they
kiss
one
another
on
the
mouth
but
if
one
of
them
is
a
little
inferior
to
the
other
they
kiss
one
another
on
the
cheeks
and
if
one
is
of
much
less
noble
rank
than
the
other
he
falls
down
before
him
and
does
worship
to
him
and
they
honour
of
all
most
after
themselves
those
nations
which
dwell
nearest
to
them
and
next
those
which
dwell
next
nearest
and
so
they
go
on
giving
honour
in
proportion
to
distance
and
they
hold
least
in
honour
those
who
dwell
furthest
off
from
themselves
esteeming
themselves
to
be
by
far
the
best
of
all
the
human
race
on
every
point
and
thinking
that
others
possess
merit
according
to
the
proportion
which
is
here
stated
and
that
those
who
dwell
furthest
from
themselves
are
the
worst
and
under
the
supremacy
of
the
medes
the
various
nations
used
also
to
govern
one
another
according
to
the
same
rule
as
the
persians
observe
in
giving
honour
the
medes
governing
the
whole
and
in
particular
those
who
dwelt
nearest
to
themselves
and
these
having
rule
over
those
who
bordered
upon
them
and
those
again
over
the
nations
that
were
next
to
them
for
the
race
went
forward
thus
ever
from
government
by
themselves
to
government
through
others
the
persians
more
than
any
other
men
admit
foreign
usages
for
they
both
wear
the
median
dress
judging
it
to
be
more
comely
than
their
own
and
also
for
fighting
the
egyptian
corslet
moreover
they
adopt
all
kinds
of
luxuries
when
they
hear
of
them
and
in
particular
they
have
learnt
from
the
hellenes
to
have
commerce
with
boys
they
marry
each
one
several
lawful
wives
and
they
get
also
a
much
larger
number
of
concubines
it
is
established
as
a
sign
of
manly
excellence
next
after
excellence
in
fight
to
be
able
to
show
many
sons
and
to
those
who
have
most
the
king
sends
gifts
every
year
for
they
consider
number
to
be
a
source
of
strength
and
they
educate
their
children
beginning
at
five
years
old
and
going
on
till
twenty
in
three
things
only
in
riding
in
shooting
and
in
speaking
the
truth
but
before
the
boy
is
five
years
old
he
does
not
come
into
the
presence
of
his
father
but
lives
with
the
women
and
it
is
so
done
for
this
reason
that
if
the
child
should
die
while
he
is
being
bred
up
he
may
not
be
the
cause
of
any
grief
to
his
father
i
commend
this
custom
of
theirs
and
also
the
one
which
is
next
to
be
mentioned
namely
that
neither
the
king
himself
shall
put
any
to
death
for
one
cause
alone
nor
any
of
the
other
persians
for
one
cause
alone
shall
do
hurt
that
is
irremediable
to
any
of
his
own
servants
but
if
after
reckoning
he
finds
that
the
wrongs
done
are
more
in
number
and
greater
than
the
services
rendered
then
only
he
gives
vent
to
his
anger
moreover
they
say
that
no
one
ever
killed
his
own
father
or
mother
but
whatever
deeds
have
been
done
which
seemed
to
be
of
this
nature
if
examined
must
necessarily
they
say
be
found
to
be
due
either
to
changelings
or
to
children
of
adulterous
birth
for
say
they
it
is
not
reasonable
to
suppose
that
the
true
parent
would
be
killed
by
his
own
son
whatever
things
it
is
not
lawful
for
them
to
do
these
it
is
not
lawful
for
them
even
to
speak
of
and
the
most
disgraceful
thing
in
their
estimation
is
to
tell
an
lie
and
next
to
this
to
owe
money
this
last
for
many
other
reasons
but
especially
because
it
is
necessary
they
say
for
him
who
owes
money
also
sometimes
to
tell
lies
and
whosoever
of
the
men
of
the
city
has
leprosy
or
whiteness
of
skin
he
does
not
come
into
a
city
nor
mingle
with
the
other
persians
and
they
say
that
he
has
these
diseases
because
he
has
offended
in
some
way
against
the
sun
but
a
stranger
who
is
taken
by
these
diseases
in
many
regions
they
drive
out
of
the
country
altogether
and
also
white
doves
alleging
against
them
the
same
cause
and
into
a
river
they
neither
make
water
nor
spit
neither
do
they
wash
their
hands
in
it
nor
allow
any
other
to
do
these
things
but
they
reverence
rivers
very
greatly
this
moreover
also
has
chanced
to
them
which
the
persians
have
themselves
failed
to
notice
but
i
have
not
failed
to
do
so
names
which
are
formed
to
correspond
with
their
bodily
shapes
or
their
magnificence
of
station
end
all
with
the
same
letter
that
letter
which
the
dorians
call
san
and
the
ionians
sigma
with
this
you
will
find
if
you
examine
the
matter
that
all
the
persian
names
end
not
some
with
this
and
others
with
other
letters
but
all
alike
so
much
i
am
able
to
say
for
certain
from
my
own
knowledge
about
them
but
what
follows
is
reported
about
their
dead
as
a
secret
mystery
and
not
with
clearness
namely
that
the
body
of
a
persian
man
is
not
buried
until
it
has
been
torn
by
a
bird
or
a
dog
the
magians
i
know
for
a
certainty
have
this
practice
for
they
do
it
openly
however
that
may
be
the
persians
cover
the
body
with
wax
and
then
bury
it
in
the
earth
now
the
magians
are
distinguished
in
many
ways
from
other
men
as
also
from
the
priests
in
egypt
for
these
last
esteem
it
a
matter
of
purity
to
kill
no
living
creature
except
the
animals
which
they
sacrifice
but
the
magians
kill
with
their
own
hands
all
creatures
except
dogs
and
men
and
they
even
make
this
a
great
end
to
aim
at
killing
both
ants
and
serpents
and
all
other
creeping
and
flying
things
about
this
custom
then
be
it
as
it
was
from
the
first
established
and
i
now
to
the
former
narrative
the
ionians
and
aiolians
as
soon
as
the
lydians
had
been
subdued
by
the
persians
sent
messengers
to
cyrus
at
sardis
desiring
to
be
his
subjects
on
the
same
terms
as
they
had
been
subjects
of
croesus
and
when
he
heard
that
which
they
proposed
to
him
he
spoke
to
them
a
fable
saying
that
a
certain
player
on
the
pipe
saw
fishes
in
the
sea
and
played
on
his
pipe
supposing
that
they
would
come
out
to
land
but
being
deceived
in
his
expectation
he
took
a
and
enclosed
a
great
multitude
of
the
fishes
and
drew
them
forth
from
the
water
and
when
he
saw
them
leaping
about
he
said
to
the
fishes
stop
dancing
i
pray
you
now
seeing
that
ye
would
not
come
out
and
dance
before
when
i
piped
cyrus
spoke
this
fable
to
the
ionians
and
aiolians
for
this
reason
because
the
ionians
had
refused
to
comply
before
when
cyrus
himself
by
a
messenger
requested
them
to
revolt
from
croesus
while
now
when
the
conquest
had
been
made
they
were
ready
to
submit
to
cyrus
thus
he
said
to
them
in
anger
and
the
ionians
when
they
heard
this
answer
brought
back
to
their
cities
put
walls
round
about
them
severally
and
gathered
together
to
the
panionion
all
except
the
men
of
miletos
for
with
these
alone
cyrus
had
sworn
an
agreement
on
the
same
terms
as
the
lydians
had
granted
the
rest
of
the
ionians
resolved
by
common
consent
to
send
messengers
to
sparta
to
ask
the
spartans
to
help
the
ionians
these
ionians
to
whom
belongs
the
panionion
had
the
fortune
to
build
their
cities
in
the
most
favourable
position
for
climate
and
seasons
of
any
men
whom
we
know
for
neither
the
regions
above
ionia
nor
those
below
neither
those
towards
the
east
nor
those
towards
the
west
produce
the
same
results
as
ionia
itself
the
regions
in
the
one
direction
being
oppressed
by
cold
and
moisture
and
those
in
the
other
by
heat
and
drought
and
these
do
not
use
all
the
same
speech
but
have
four
different
variations
of
language
first
of
their
cities
on
the
side
of
the
south
lies
miletos
and
next
to
it
myus
and
priene
these
are
settlements
made
in
caria
and
speak
the
same
language
with
one
another
and
the
following
are
in
lydia
colophon
lebedos
teos
clazomenai
phocaia
these
cities
resemble
not
at
all
those
mentioned
before
in
the
speech
which
they
use
but
they
agree
one
with
another
there
remain
besides
three
ionian
cities
of
which
two
are
established
in
the
islands
of
samos
and
chios
and
one
is
built
upon
the
mainland
namely
erythrai
now
the
men
of
chios
and
of
erythrai
use
the
same
form
of
language
but
the
samians
have
one
for
themselves
alone
thus
there
result
four
separate
forms
of
language
of
these
ionians
then
those
of
miletos
were
sheltered
from
danger
since
they
had
sworn
an
agreement
and
those
of
them
who
lived
in
islands
had
no
cause
for
fear
for
the
phenicians
were
not
yet
subjects
of
the
persians
and
the
persians
themselves
were
not
now
these
were
parted
off
from
the
other
ionians
for
no
other
reason
than
this
whole
hellenic
nation
was
at
that
time
weak
but
of
all
its
races
the
ionian
was
much
the
weakest
and
of
least
account
except
athens
indeed
it
had
no
considerable
city
now
the
other
ionians
and
among
them
the
athenians
avoided
the
name
not
wishing
to
be
called
ionians
nay
even
now
i
perceive
that
the
greater
number
of
them
are
ashamed
of
the
name
but
these
twelve
cities
not
only
prided
themselves
on
the
name
but
established
a
temple
of
their
own
to
which
they
gave
the
name
of
panionion
and
they
made
resolution
not
to
grant
a
share
in
it
to
any
other
ionians
nor
indeed
did
any
ask
to
share
it
except
those
of
smyrna
just
as
the
dorians
of
that
district
which
is
now
called
the
five
cities
but
was
formerly
called
the
six
cities
take
care
not
to
admit
any
of
the
neighbouring
dorians
to
the
temple
of
triopion
and
even
exclude
from
sharing
in
it
those
of
their
own
body
who
commit
any
offence
as
regards
the
temple
for
example
in
the
games
of
the
triopian
apollo
they
used
formerly
to
set
bronze
tripods
as
prizes
for
the
victors
and
the
rule
was
that
those
who
received
them
should
not
carry
them
out
of
the
temple
but
dedicate
them
then
and
there
to
the
god
there
was
a
man
then
of
halicarnassos
whose
name
was
agasicles
who
being
a
victor
paid
no
regard
to
this
rule
but
carried
away
the
tripod
to
his
own
house
and
hung
it
up
there
upon
a
nail
on
this
ground
the
other
five
cities
lindos
ialysos
and
cameiros
cos
and
cnidos
excluded
the
sixth
city
halicarnassos
from
sharing
in
the
temple
upon
these
they
laid
this
penalty
but
as
for
the
ionians
i
think
that
the
reason
why
they
made
of
themselves
twelve
cities
and
would
not
receive
any
more
into
their
body
was
because
when
they
dwelt
in
peloponnesus
there
were
of
them
twelve
divisions
just
as
now
there
are
twelve
divisions
of
the
achaians
who
drove
the
ionians
out
for
first
beginning
from
the
side
of
sikyon
comes
pellene
then
aigeira
and
aigai
in
which
last
is
the
river
crathis
with
a
perpetual
flow
whence
the
river
of
the
same
name
in
italy
received
its
name
and
bura
and
helike
to
which
the
ionians
fled
for
refuge
when
they
were
worsted
by
the
achaians
in
fight
and
aigion
and
rhypes
and
patreis
and
phareis
and
olenos
where
is
the
great
river
peiros
and
dyme
and
tritaieis
of
which
the
last
alone
has
an
inland
position
these
form
now
twelve
divisions
of
the
achaians
and
in
former
times
they
were
divisions
of
the
ionians
for
this
reason
then
the
ionians
also
made
for
themselves
twelve
cities
for
at
any
rate
to
say
that
these
are
any
more
ionians
than
the
other
ionians
or
have
at
all
a
nobler
descent
is
mere
folly
considering
that
a
large
part
of
them
are
abantians
from
euboea
who
have
no
share
even
in
the
name
of
ionia
and
minyai
of
orchomenos
have
been
mingled
with
them
and
cadmeians
and
dryopians
and
phokians
who
seceded
from
their
native
state
and
molossians
and
pelasgians
of
arcadia
and
dorians
of
epidauros
and
many
other
races
have
been
mingled
with
them
and
those
of
them
who
set
forth
to
their
settlements
from
the
city
hall
of
athens
and
who
esteem
themselves
the
most
noble
by
descent
of
the
ionians
these
i
say
brought
no
women
with
them
to
their
settlement
but
took
carian
women
whose
parents
they
slew
and
on
account
of
this
slaughter
these
women
laid
down
for
themselves
a
rule
imposing
oaths
on
one
another
and
handed
it
on
to
their
daughters
that
they
should
never
eat
with
their
husbands
nor
should
a
wife
call
her
own
husband
by
name
for
this
reason
because
the
ionians
had
slain
their
fathers
and
husbands
and
children
and
then
having
done
this
had
them
to
wife
this
happened
at
miletos
moreover
some
of
them
set
lykian
kings
over
them
descendants
of
glaucos
and
hippolochos
while
others
were
ruled
by
cauconians
of
pylos
descendants
of
codros
the
son
of
melanthos
and
others
again
by
princes
of
the
two
races
combined
since
however
these
hold
on
to
the
name
more
than
the
other
ionians
let
them
be
called
if
they
will
the
ionians
of
truly
pure
descent
but
in
fact
all
are
ionians
who
have
their
descent
from
athens
and
who
keep
the
feast
of
apaturia
and
this
all
keep
except
the
men
of
ephesos
and
colophon
for
these
alone
of
all
the
ionians
do
not
keep
the
apaturia
and
that
on
the
ground
of
some
murder
committed
now
the
panionion
is
a
sacred
place
on
the
north
side
of
mycale
set
apart
by
common
agreement
of
the
ionians
for
poseidon
of
helike
and
this
mycale
is
a
promontory
of
the
mainland
running
out
westwards
towards
samos
where
the
ionians
gathering
together
from
their
cities
used
to
hold
a
festival
which
they
called
the
panionia
and
not
only
the
feasts
of
the
ionians
but
also
those
of
all
the
hellenes
equally
are
subject
to
this
rule
that
their
names
all
end
in
the
same
letter
just
like
the
names
of
the
persians
these
then
are
the
ionian
cities
and
those
of
aiolia
are
as
follows
which
is
called
phriconis
larisai
temnos
killa
notion
aigiroëssa
pitane
aigaiai
myrina
gryneia
these
are
the
ancient
cities
of
the
aiolians
eleven
in
number
since
one
smyrna
was
severed
from
them
by
the
ionians
for
these
cities
that
is
those
on
the
mainland
used
also
formerly
to
be
twelve
in
number
and
these
aiolians
had
the
fortune
to
settle
in
a
land
which
is
more
fertile
than
that
of
the
ionians
but
in
respect
of
climate
less
favoured
now
the
aiolians
lost
smyrna
in
the
following
manner
men
of
colophon
who
had
been
worsted
in
party
strife
and
had
been
driven
from
their
native
city
were
received
there
for
refuge
and
after
this
the
colophonian
exiles
watched
for
a
time
when
the
men
of
smyrna
were
celebrating
a
festival
to
dionysos
outside
the
walls
and
then
they
closed
the
gates
against
them
and
got
possession
of
the
city
after
this
when
the
whole
body
of
aiolians
came
to
the
rescue
they
made
an
agreement
that
the
ionians
should
give
up
the
movable
goods
and
that
on
this
condition
the
aiolians
should
abandon
smyrna
when
the
men
of
smyrna
had
done
this
the
remaining
eleven
cities
divided
them
amongst
themselves
and
made
them
their
own
citizens
these
then
are
the
aiolian
cities
upon
the
mainland
with
the
exception
of
those
situated
on
mount
ida
for
these
are
separate
from
the
rest
and
of
those
which
are
in
the
islands
there
are
five
in
lesbos
for
the
sixth
which
was
situated
in
lesbos
namely
arisba
was
enslaved
by
the
men
of
methymna
though
its
citizens
were
of
the
same
race
as
they
and
in
tenedos
there
is
one
city
and
another
in
what
are
called
the
hundred
isles
now
the
lesbians
and
the
men
of
tenedos
like
those
ionians
who
dwelt
in
the
islands
had
no
cause
for
fear
but
the
remaining
cities
came
to
a
common
agreement
to
follow
the
ionians
whithersoever
they
should
lead
now
when
the
messengers
from
the
ionians
and
aiolians
came
to
sparta
for
this
business
was
carried
out
with
speed
they
chose
before
all
others
to
speak
for
them
the
phocaian
whose
name
was
pythermos
he
then
put
upon
him
a
purple
cloak
in
order
that
as
many
as
possible
of
the
spartans
might
hear
of
it
and
come
together
and
having
been
introduced
before
the
assembly
he
spoke
at
length
asking
the
spartans
to
help
them
the
lacedemonians
however
would
not
listen
to
him
but
resolved
on
the
contrary
not
to
help
the
ionians
so
they
departed
and
the
lacedemonians
having
dismissed
the
messengers
of
the
ionians
sent
men
notwithstanding
in
a
ship
of
fifty
oars
to
find
out
as
i
imagine
about
the
affairs
of
cyrus
and
about
ionia
these
when
they
came
to
phocaia
sent
to
sardis
the
man
of
most
repute
among
them
whose
name
was
lacrines
to
report
to
cyrus
the
saying
of
the
lacedemonians
bidding
him
do
hurt
to
no
city
of
the
hellas
since
they
would
not
permit
it
when
the
herald
had
spoken
thus
cyrus
is
said
to
have
asked
those
of
the
hellenes
whom
he
had
with
him
what
men
the
lacedemonians
were
and
how
many
in
number
that
they
made
this
proclamation
to
him
and
hearing
their
answer
he
said
to
the
spartan
herald
never
yet
did
i
fear
men
such
as
these
who
have
a
place
appointed
in
the
midst
of
their
city
where
they
gather
together
and
deceive
one
another
by
false
oaths
and
if
i
continue
in
good
health
not
the
misfortunes
of
the
ionians
will
be
for
them
a
subject
of
talk
but
rather
their
own
these
words
cyrus
threw
out
scornfully
with
reference
to
the
hellenes
in
general
because
they
have
got
for
themselves
markets
and
practise
buying
and
selling
there
for
the
persians
themselves
are
not
wont
to
use
markets
nor
have
they
any
at
all
after
this
he
entrusted
sardis
to
tabalos
a
persian
and
the
gold
both
of
croesus
and
of
the
other
lydians
he
gave
to
pactyas
a
lydian
to
take
charge
of
and
himself
marched
away
to
agbatana
taking
with
him
croesus
and
making
for
the
present
no
account
of
the
ionians
for
babylon
stood
in
his
way
still
as
also
the
bactrian
nation
and
the
sacans
and
the
egyptians
and
against
these
he
meant
to
make
expeditions
himself
while
sending
some
other
commander
about
the
ionians
but
when
cyrus
had
marched
away
from
sardis
pactyas
caused
the
lydians
to
revolt
from
tabalos
and
from
cyrus
this
man
went
down
to
the
sea
and
having
in
his
possession
all
the
gold
that
there
had
been
in
sardis
he
hired
for
himself
mercenaries
and
persuaded
the
men
of
the
to
join
his
expedition
so
he
marched
on
sardis
and
besieged
tabalos
having
shut
himself
up
in
the
citadel
hearing
this
on
his
way
cyrus
said
to
croesus
as
follows
croesus
what
end
shall
i
find
of
these
things
which
are
coming
to
pass
the
lydians
will
not
cease
as
it
seems
from
giving
trouble
to
me
and
from
having
it
themselves
i
doubt
me
if
it
were
not
best
to
sell
them
all
as
slaves
for
as
it
is
i
see
that
i
have
done
in
like
manner
as
if
one
should
slay
the
father
and
then
spare
his
sons
just
so
i
took
prisoner
and
am
carrying
away
thee
who
wert
much
more
than
the
father
of
the
lydians
while
to
the
lydians
themselves
i
delivered
up
their
city
and
can
i
feel
surprise
after
this
that
they
have
revolted
from
me
thus
he
said
what
was
in
his
mind
but
croesus
answered
him
as
follows
fearing
lest
he
should
destroy
sardis
o
king
that
which
thou
hast
said
is
not
without
reason
but
do
not
thou
altogether
give
vent
to
thy
wrath
nor
destroy
an
ancient
city
which
is
guiltless
both
of
the
former
things
and
also
of
those
which
have
come
to
pass
now
for
as
to
the
former
things
it
was
i
who
did
them
and
i
bear
the
consequences
heaped
upon
my
head
and
as
for
what
is
now
being
done
since
the
wrongdoer
is
pactyas
to
whom
thou
didst
entrust
the
charge
of
sardis
let
him
pay
the
penalty
but
the
lydians
i
pray
thee
pardon
and
lay
upon
them
commands
as
follows
in
order
that
they
may
not
revolt
nor
be
a
cause
of
danger
to
thee
to
them
and
forbid
them
to
possess
weapons
of
war
but
bid
them
on
the
other
hand
put
on
tunics
under
their
outer
garments
and
be
shod
with
buskins
and
proclaim
to
them
that
they
train
their
sons
to
play
the
lyre
and
the
harp
and
to
be
and
soon
thou
shalt
see
o
king
that
they
have
become
women
instead
of
men
so
that
there
will
be
no
fear
that
they
will
revolt
from
thee
croesus
i
say
suggested
to
him
this
perceiving
that
this
was
better
for
the
lydians
than
to
be
reduced
to
slavery
and
sold
for
he
knew
that
if
he
did
not
offer
a
sufficient
reason
he
would
not
persuade
cyrus
to
change
his
mind
and
he
feared
lest
at
some
future
time
if
they
should
escape
the
present
danger
the
lydians
might
revolt
from
the
persians
and
be
destroyed
and
cyrus
was
greatly
pleased
with
the
suggestion
made
and
slackened
from
his
wrath
saying
that
he
agreed
with
his
advice
then
he
called
mazares
a
mede
and
laid
charge
upon
him
to
proclaim
to
the
lydians
that
which
croesus
suggested
and
moreover
to
sell
into
slavery
all
the
rest
who
had
joined
with
the
lydians
in
the
expedition
to
sardis
and
finally
by
all
means
to
bring
pactyas
himself
alive
to
cyrus
having
given
this
charge
upon
the
road
he
continued
his
march
to
the
native
land
of
the
persians
but
pactyas
hearing
that
an
army
was
approaching
to
fight
against
him
was
struck
with
fear
and
fled
away
forthwith
to
kyme
then
mazares
the
mede
marched
upon
sardis
with
a
certain
portion
of
the
army
of
cyrus
and
as
he
did
not
find
pactyas
or
his
followers
any
longer
at
sardis
he
first
compelled
the
lydians
to
perform
the
commands
of
cyrus
and
by
his
commands
the
lydians
changed
the
whole
manner
of
their
life
after
this
mazares
proceeded
to
send
messengers
to
kyme
bidding
them
give
up
pactyas
and
the
men
of
kyme
resolved
to
refer
to
the
god
at
branchidai
the
question
what
counsel
they
should
follow
for
there
was
there
an
oracle
established
of
old
time
which
all
the
ionians
and
aiolians
were
wont
to
consult
and
this
place
is
in
the
territory
of
miletos
above
the
port
of
panormos
so
the
men
of
kyme
sent
messengers
to
the
branchidai
to
inquire
of
the
god
and
they
asked
what
course
they
should
take
about
pactyas
so
as
to
do
that
which
was
pleasing
to
the
gods
when
they
thus
inquired
the
answer
was
given
them
that
they
should
deliver
up
pactyas
to
the
persians
and
the
men
of
kyme
having
heard
this
answer
reported
were
disposed
to
give
him
up
then
when
the
mass
of
the
people
were
thus
disposed
aristodicos
the
son
of
heracleides
a
man
of
repute
among
the
citizens
stopped
the
men
of
kyme
from
doing
so
having
distrust
of
the
answer
and
thinking
that
those
sent
to
inquire
were
not
speaking
the
truth
until
at
last
other
messengers
were
sent
to
the
oracle
to
ask
a
second
time
about
pactyas
and
of
them
aristodicos
was
one
when
these
came
to
branchidai
aristodicos
stood
forth
from
the
rest
and
consulted
the
oracle
asking
as
follows
lord
there
came
to
us
a
suppliant
for
protection
pactyas
the
lydian
flying
from
a
violent
death
at
the
hands
of
the
persians
and
they
demand
him
from
us
bidding
the
men
of
kyme
give
him
up
but
we
though
we
fear
the
power
of
the
persians
yet
have
not
ventured
up
to
this
time
to
deliver
to
them
the
suppliant
until
thy
counsel
shall
be
clearly
manifested
to
us
saying
which
of
the
two
things
we
ought
to
do
he
thus
inquired
but
the
god
again
declared
to
them
the
same
answer
bidding
them
deliver
up
pactyas
to
the
persians
upon
this
aristodicos
with
deliberate
purpose
did
as
follows
went
all
round
the
temple
destroying
the
nests
of
the
sparrows
and
of
all
the
other
kinds
of
birds
which
had
been
hatched
on
the
temple
and
while
he
was
doing
this
it
is
said
that
a
voice
came
from
the
inner
shrine
directed
to
aristodicos
and
speaking
thus
thou
most
impious
of
men
why
dost
thou
dare
to
do
this
dost
thou
carry
away
by
force
from
my
temple
the
suppliants
for
my
protection
and
aristodicos
it
is
said
not
being
at
all
at
a
loss
replied
to
this
lord
dost
thou
thus
come
to
the
assistance
of
thy
suppliants
and
yet
biddest
the
men
of
kyme
deliver
up
theirs
and
the
god
answered
him
again
thus
yea
i
bid
you
do
so
that
ye
may
perish
the
more
quickly
for
your
impiety
so
that
ye
may
not
at
any
future
time
come
to
the
oracle
to
ask
about
delivering
up
of
suppliants
when
the
men
of
kyme
heard
this
saying
reported
not
wishing
either
to
be
destroyed
by
giving
him
up
or
to
be
besieged
by
keeping
him
with
them
they
sent
him
away
to
mytilene
those
of
mytilene
however
when
mazares
sent
messages
to
them
were
preparing
to
deliver
up
pactyas
for
a
price
but
what
the
price
was
i
can
not
say
for
certain
since
the
bargain
was
never
completed
for
the
men
of
kyme
when
they
learnt
that
this
was
being
done
by
the
mytilenians
sent
a
vessel
to
lesbos
and
conveyed
away
pactyas
to
chios
after
this
he
was
dragged
forcibly
from
the
temple
of
athene
poliuchos
by
the
chians
and
delivered
up
and
the
chians
delivered
him
up
receiving
atarneus
in
now
this
atarneus
is
a
region
of
mysia
opposition
lesbos
so
the
persians
having
received
pactyas
kept
him
under
guard
meaning
to
produce
him
before
cyrus
and
a
long
time
elapsed
during
which
none
of
the
chians
either
used
grown
in
this
region
of
atarneus
for
pouring
out
in
sacrifice
to
any
god
or
baked
cakes
for
offering
of
the
corn
which
grew
there
but
all
the
produce
of
this
land
was
excluded
from
every
kind
of
sacred
service
the
men
of
chios
had
then
delivered
up
pactyas
and
after
this
mazares
made
expedition
against
those
who
had
joined
in
besieging
tabalos
and
first
he
reduced
to
slavery
those
of
priene
then
he
overran
the
whole
plain
of
the
maiander
making
spoil
of
it
for
his
army
and
magnesia
in
the
same
manner
and
straightway
after
this
he
fell
sick
and
died
after
he
was
dead
harpagos
came
down
to
take
his
place
in
command
being
also
a
mede
by
race
this
was
the
man
whom
the
king
of
the
medes
astyages
feasted
with
the
unlawful
banquet
and
who
helped
to
give
the
kingdom
to
cyrus
this
man
being
appointed
commander
then
by
cyrus
came
to
ionia
and
proceeded
to
take
the
cities
by
throwing
up
mounds
against
them
for
when
he
had
enclosed
any
people
within
their
walls
then
he
threw
up
mounds
against
the
walls
and
took
their
city
by
storm
and
the
first
city
of
ionia
upon
which
he
made
an
attempt
was
phocaia
now
these
phocaians
were
the
first
of
the
hellenes
who
made
long
voyages
and
these
are
they
who
discovered
the
adriatic
and
tyrsenia
and
iberia
and
tartessos
and
they
made
voyages
not
in
round
ships
but
in
vessels
of
fifty
oars
these
came
to
tartessos
and
became
friends
with
the
king
of
the
tartessians
whose
name
was
arganthonios
he
was
ruler
of
the
tartessians
for
eighty
years
and
lived
in
all
one
hundred
and
twenty
with
this
man
i
say
the
phocaians
became
so
exceedingly
friendly
that
first
he
bade
them
leave
ionia
and
dwell
wherever
they
desired
in
his
own
land
and
as
he
did
not
prevail
upon
the
phocaians
to
do
this
afterwards
hearing
from
them
of
the
mede
how
his
power
was
increasing
he
gave
them
money
to
build
a
wall
about
their
city
and
he
did
this
without
sparing
for
the
circuit
of
the
wall
is
many
furlongs
in
extent
and
it
is
built
all
of
large
stones
closely
fitted
together
the
wall
of
the
phocaians
was
made
in
this
manner
and
harpagos
having
marched
his
army
against
them
began
to
besiege
them
at
the
same
time
holding
forth
to
them
proposals
and
saying
that
it
was
enough
to
satisfy
him
if
the
phocaians
were
willing
to
throw
down
one
battlement
of
their
wall
and
dedicate
one
single
house
but
the
phocaians
being
very
greatly
grieved
at
the
thought
of
subjection
said
that
they
wished
to
deliberate
about
the
matter
for
one
day
and
after
that
they
would
give
their
answer
and
they
asked
him
to
withdraw
his
army
from
the
wall
while
they
were
deliberating
harpagos
said
that
he
knew
very
well
what
they
were
meaning
to
do
nevertheless
he
was
willing
to
allow
them
to
deliberate
so
in
the
time
that
followed
when
harpagos
had
withdrawn
his
army
from
the
wall
the
phocaians
drew
down
their
galleys
to
the
sea
put
into
them
their
children
and
women
and
all
their
movable
goods
and
besides
them
the
images
out
of
the
temples
and
the
other
votive
offerings
except
such
as
were
made
of
bronze
or
stone
or
consisted
of
paintings
all
the
rest
i
say
they
put
into
the
ships
and
having
embarked
themselves
they
sailed
towards
chios
and
the
persians
obtained
possession
of
phocaia
the
city
being
deserted
of
the
inhabitants
but
as
for
the
phocaians
since
the
men
of
chios
would
not
sell
them
at
their
request
the
islands
called
oinussai
from
the
fear
lest
these
islands
might
be
made
a
seat
of
trade
and
their
island
might
be
shut
out
therefore
they
set
out
for
kyrnos
for
in
kyrnos
twenty
years
before
this
they
had
established
a
city
named
alalia
in
accordance
with
an
oracle
now
arganthonios
by
that
time
was
dead
and
when
they
were
setting
out
for
kyrnos
they
first
sailed
to
phocaia
and
slaughtered
the
persian
garrison
to
whose
charge
harpagos
had
delivered
the
city
then
after
they
had
achieved
this
they
made
solemn
imprecations
on
any
one
of
them
who
should
be
left
behind
from
their
voyage
and
moreover
they
sank
a
mass
of
iron
in
the
sea
and
swore
that
not
until
that
mass
should
appear
again
on
the
surface
would
they
to
phocaia
however
as
they
were
setting
forth
to
kyrnos
more
than
half
of
the
citizens
were
seized
with
yearning
and
regret
for
their
city
and
for
their
native
land
and
they
proved
false
to
their
oath
and
sailed
back
to
phocaia
but
those
of
them
who
kept
the
oath
still
weighed
anchor
from
the
islands
of
oinussai
and
sailed
when
these
came
to
kyrnos
for
five
years
they
dwelt
together
with
those
who
had
come
thither
before
and
they
founded
temples
there
then
since
they
plundered
the
property
of
all
their
neighbours
the
tyrsenians
and
carthaginians
made
expedition
against
them
by
agreement
with
one
another
each
with
sixty
ships
and
the
phocaians
also
manned
their
vessels
sixty
in
number
and
came
to
meet
the
enemy
in
that
which
is
called
the
sardinian
sea
and
when
they
encountered
one
another
in
the
the
phocaians
won
a
kind
of
cadmean
victory
for
forty
of
their
ships
were
destroyed
and
the
remaining
twenty
were
disabled
having
had
their
prows
bent
aside
so
they
sailed
in
to
alalia
and
took
up
their
children
and
their
women
and
their
other
possessions
as
much
as
their
ships
proved
capable
of
carrying
and
then
they
left
kyrnos
behind
them
and
sailed
to
rhegion
but
as
for
the
crews
of
the
ships
that
were
destroyed
the
carthaginians
and
tyrsenians
obtained
much
the
greater
number
of
them
and
these
they
brought
to
land
and
killed
by
stoning
after
this
the
men
of
agylla
found
that
everything
which
passed
by
the
spot
where
the
phocaians
were
laid
after
being
stoned
became
either
distorted
or
crippled
or
paralysed
both
small
cattle
and
beasts
of
burden
and
human
creatures
so
the
men
of
agylla
sent
to
delphi
desiring
to
purge
themselves
of
the
offence
and
the
pythian
prophetess
bade
them
do
that
which
the
men
of
agylla
still
continue
to
perform
that
is
to
say
they
make
great
sacrifices
in
honour
of
the
dead
and
hold
at
the
place
a
contest
of
athletics
and
these
then
of
the
phocaians
had
the
fate
which
i
have
said
but
those
of
them
who
took
refuge
at
rhegion
started
from
thence
and
took
possession
of
that
city
in
the
land
of
oinotria
which
now
is
called
hyele
this
they
founded
having
learnt
from
a
man
of
poseidonia
that
the
pythian
prophetess
by
her
answer
meant
them
to
found
a
temple
to
kyrnos
who
was
a
hero
and
not
to
found
a
settlement
in
the
island
of
kyrnos
about
phocaia
in
ionia
it
happened
thus
and
nearly
the
same
thing
also
was
done
by
the
men
of
teos
for
as
soon
as
harpagos
took
their
wall
with
a
mound
they
embarked
in
their
ships
and
sailed
straightway
for
thrace
and
there
they
founded
the
city
of
abdera
which
before
them
timesios
of
clazomenai
founded
and
had
no
profit
therefrom
but
was
driven
out
by
the
thracians
and
now
he
is
honoured
as
a
hero
by
the
teïans
in
abdera
these
alone
of
all
the
ionians
left
their
native
cities
because
they
would
not
endure
subjection
but
the
other
ionians
except
the
milesians
did
indeed
contend
in
arms
with
harpagos
like
those
who
left
their
homes
and
proved
themselves
brave
men
fighting
each
for
his
own
native
city
but
when
they
were
defeated
and
captured
they
remained
all
in
their
own
place
and
performed
that
which
was
laid
upon
them
but
the
milesians
as
i
have
also
said
before
had
made
a
sworn
agreement
with
cyrus
himself
and
kept
still
thus
for
the
second
time
ionia
had
been
reduced
to
subjection
and
when
harpagos
had
conquered
the
ionians
on
the
mainland
then
the
ionians
who
dwelt
in
the
islands
being
struck
with
fear
by
these
things
gave
themselves
over
to
cyrus
when
the
ionians
had
been
thus
evilly
entreated
but
were
continuing
still
to
hold
their
gatherings
as
before
at
the
panionion
bias
a
man
of
priene
set
forth
to
the
ionians
as
i
am
informed
a
most
profitable
counsel
by
following
which
they
might
have
been
the
most
prosperous
of
all
the
hellenes
he
urged
that
the
ionians
should
set
forth
in
one
common
expedition
and
sail
to
sardinia
and
after
that
found
a
single
city
for
all
the
ionians
and
thus
they
would
escape
subjection
and
would
be
prosperous
inhabiting
the
largest
of
all
islands
and
being
rulers
over
others
whereas
if
they
remained
in
ionia
he
did
not
perceive
he
said
that
freedom
would
any
longer
exist
for
them
this
was
the
counsel
given
by
bias
of
priene
after
the
ionians
had
been
ruined
but
a
good
counsel
too
was
given
before
the
ruin
of
ionia
by
thales
a
man
of
miletos
who
was
by
descent
of
phenician
race
he
advised
the
ionians
to
have
one
single
seat
of
government
and
that
this
should
be
at
teos
for
teos
he
said
was
in
the
centre
of
ionia
and
that
the
other
cities
should
be
inhabited
as
before
but
accounted
just
as
if
they
were
demes
these
men
set
forth
to
them
counsels
of
the
kind
which
i
have
said
but
harpagos
after
subduing
ionia
proceeded
to
march
against
the
carians
and
caunians
and
lykians
taking
also
ionians
and
aiolians
to
help
him
of
these
the
carians
came
to
the
mainland
from
the
islands
for
being
of
old
time
subjects
of
minos
and
being
called
leleges
they
used
to
dwell
in
the
islands
paying
no
tribute
so
far
back
as
i
am
able
to
arrive
by
hearsay
but
whenever
minos
required
it
they
used
to
supply
his
ships
with
seamen
and
as
minos
subdued
much
land
and
was
fortunate
in
his
fighting
the
carian
nation
was
of
all
nations
by
much
the
most
famous
at
that
time
together
with
him
and
they
produced
three
inventions
of
which
the
hellenes
adopted
the
use
that
is
to
say
the
carians
were
those
who
first
set
the
fashion
of
fastening
crests
on
helmets
and
of
making
the
devices
which
are
put
onto
shields
and
these
also
were
the
first
who
made
handles
for
their
shields
whereas
up
to
that
time
all
who
were
wont
to
use
shields
carried
them
without
handles
and
with
leathern
straps
to
guide
them
having
them
hung
about
their
necks
and
their
left
shoulders
then
after
the
lapse
of
a
long
time
the
dorians
and
ionians
drove
the
carians
out
of
the
islands
and
so
they
came
to
the
mainland
with
respect
to
the
carians
the
cretans
relate
that
it
happened
thus
the
carians
themselves
however
do
not
agree
with
this
account
but
suppose
that
they
are
dwellers
on
the
mainland
from
the
beginning
and
that
they
went
always
by
the
same
name
which
they
have
now
and
they
point
as
evidence
of
this
to
an
ancient
temple
of
carian
zeus
at
mylasa
in
which
the
mysians
and
lydians
share
as
being
brother
races
of
the
carians
for
they
say
that
lydos
and
mysos
were
brothers
of
car
these
share
in
it
but
those
who
being
of
another
race
have
come
to
speak
the
same
language
as
the
carians
these
have
no
share
in
it
it
seems
to
me
however
that
the
caunians
are
dwellers
there
from
the
beginning
though
they
say
themselves
that
they
came
from
crete
but
they
have
been
assimilated
to
the
carian
race
in
language
or
else
the
carians
to
the
caunian
race
i
can
not
with
certainty
determine
which
they
have
customs
however
in
which
they
differ
very
much
from
all
other
men
as
well
as
from
the
carians
for
example
the
fairest
thing
in
their
estimation
is
to
meet
together
in
numbers
for
drinking
according
to
equality
of
age
or
friendship
both
men
women
and
children
and
again
when
they
had
founded
temples
for
foreign
deities
afterwards
they
changed
their
purpose
and
resolved
to
worship
only
their
own
native
gods
and
the
whole
body
of
caunian
young
men
put
on
their
armour
and
made
pursuit
as
far
as
the
borders
of
the
calyndians
beating
the
air
with
their
spears
and
they
said
that
they
were
casting
the
foreign
gods
out
of
the
land
such
are
the
customs
which
these
have
the
lykians
however
have
sprung
originally
from
crete
for
in
old
time
the
whole
of
crete
was
possessed
by
barbarians
and
when
the
sons
of
europa
sarpedon
and
minos
came
to
be
at
variance
in
crete
about
the
kingdom
minos
having
got
the
better
in
the
strife
of
parties
drove
out
both
sarpedon
himself
and
those
of
his
party
and
they
having
been
expelled
came
to
the
land
of
milyas
in
asia
for
the
land
which
now
the
lykians
inhabit
was
anciently
called
milyas
and
the
milyans
were
then
called
solymoi
now
while
sarpedon
reigned
over
them
they
were
called
by
the
name
which
they
had
when
they
came
thither
and
by
which
the
lykians
are
even
now
called
by
the
neighbouring
tribes
namely
termilai
but
when
from
athens
lycos
the
son
of
pandion
came
to
the
land
of
the
termilai
and
to
sarpedon
he
too
having
been
driven
out
by
his
brother
namely
aigeus
then
by
the
name
taken
from
lycos
they
were
called
after
a
time
lykians
the
customs
which
these
have
are
partly
cretan
and
partly
carian
but
one
custom
they
have
which
is
peculiar
to
them
and
in
which
they
agree
with
no
other
people
that
is
they
call
themselves
by
their
mothers
and
not
by
their
fathers
and
if
one
asks
his
neighbour
who
he
is
he
will
state
his
parentage
on
the
mother
side
and
enumerate
his
mother
female
ascendants
and
if
a
woman
who
is
a
citizen
marry
a
slave
the
children
are
accounted
to
be
of
gentle
birth
but
if
a
man
who
is
a
citizen
though
he
were
the
first
man
among
them
have
a
slave
for
wife
or
concubine
the
children
are
without
civil
rights
now
the
carians
were
reduced
to
subjection
by
harpagos
without
any
brilliant
deed
displayed
either
by
the
carians
themselves
or
by
those
of
the
hellenes
who
dwell
in
this
land
of
these
last
there
are
besides
others
the
men
of
cnidos
settlers
from
lacedemon
whose
land
runs
out
into
the
sea
being
in
fact
the
region
which
is
called
triopion
beginning
from
the
peninsula
of
bybassos
and
since
all
the
land
of
cnidos
except
a
small
part
is
washed
by
the
sea
for
the
part
of
it
which
looks
towards
the
north
is
bounded
by
the
gulf
of
keramos
and
that
which
looks
to
the
south
by
the
sea
off
syme
and
rhodes
therefore
the
men
of
cnidos
began
to
dig
through
this
small
part
which
is
about
five
furlongs
across
while
harpagos
was
subduing
ionia
desiring
to
make
their
land
an
island
and
within
the
isthmus
all
was
theirs
for
where
the
territory
of
cnidos
ends
in
the
direction
of
the
mainland
here
is
the
isthmus
which
they
were
digging
across
and
while
the
cnidians
were
working
at
it
with
a
great
number
of
men
it
was
perceived
that
the
men
who
worked
suffered
injury
much
more
than
might
have
been
expected
and
in
a
more
supernatural
manner
both
in
other
parts
of
their
bodies
and
especially
in
their
eyes
when
the
rock
was
being
broken
up
so
they
sent
men
to
ask
the
oracle
at
delphi
what
the
cause
of
the
difficulty
was
and
the
pythian
prophetess
as
the
men
of
cnidos
themselves
report
gave
them
this
reply
in
trimeter
verse
fence
not
the
place
with
towers
nor
dig
the
isthmus
through
zeus
would
have
made
your
land
an
island
had
he
willed
when
the
pythian
prophetess
had
given
this
oracle
the
men
of
cnidos
not
only
ceased
from
their
digging
but
delivered
themselves
to
harpagos
without
resistance
when
he
came
against
them
with
his
army
there
were
also
the
pedasians
who
dwelt
in
the
inland
country
above
halicarnassos
and
among
these
whenever
anything
hurtful
is
about
to
happen
either
to
themselves
or
to
their
neighbours
the
priestess
of
athene
has
a
great
beard
this
befell
them
three
times
these
of
all
about
caria
were
the
only
men
who
held
out
for
any
time
against
harpagos
and
they
gave
him
trouble
more
than
any
other
people
having
fortified
a
mountain
called
lide
after
a
time
the
pedasians
were
conquered
and
the
lykians
when
harpagos
marched
his
army
into
the
plain
of
xanthos
came
out
against
him
and
fought
few
against
many
and
displayed
proofs
of
valour
but
being
defeated
and
confined
within
their
city
they
gathered
together
into
the
citadel
their
wives
and
their
children
their
property
and
their
servants
and
after
that
they
set
fire
to
this
citadel
so
that
it
was
all
in
flames
and
having
done
so
and
sworn
terrible
oaths
with
one
another
they
went
forth
against
the
enemy
and
were
slain
in
fight
that
is
to
say
all
the
men
of
xanthos
and
of
the
xanthians
who
now
claim
to
be
lykians
the
greater
number
have
come
in
from
abroad
except
only
eighty
households
but
these
eighty
households
happened
at
that
time
to
be
away
from
their
native
place
and
so
they
escaped
destruction
thus
harpagos
obtained
possession
of
caunos
for
the
men
of
caunos
imitated
in
most
respects
the
behaviour
of
the
lykians
so
harpagos
was
conquering
the
coast
regions
of
asia
and
cyrus
himself
meanwhile
was
doing
the
same
in
the
upper
parts
of
it
subduing
every
nation
and
passing
over
none
now
most
of
these
actions
i
shall
pass
over
in
silence
but
the
undertakings
which
gave
him
trouble
more
than
the
rest
and
which
are
the
most
worthy
of
note
of
these
i
shall
make
mention
cyrus
so
soon
as
he
had
made
subject
to
himself
all
other
parts
of
the
mainland
proceeded
to
attack
the
assyrians
now
assyria
has
doubtless
many
other
great
cities
but
the
most
famous
and
the
strongest
and
the
place
where
the
seat
of
their
monarchy
had
been
established
after
nineveh
was
destroyed
was
babylon
which
was
a
city
such
as
i
shall
lies
in
a
great
plain
and
in
size
it
is
such
that
each
face
measures
one
hundred
and
twenty
furlongs
the
shape
of
the
whole
being
square
thus
the
furlongs
of
the
circuit
of
the
city
amount
in
all
to
four
hundred
and
eighty
such
is
the
size
of
the
city
of
babylon
and
it
had
a
magnificence
greater
than
all
other
cities
of
which
we
have
knowledge
first
there
runs
round
it
a
trench
deep
and
broad
and
full
of
water
then
a
wall
fifty
royal
cubits
in
thickness
and
two
hundred
cubits
in
height
now
the
royal
cubit
is
larger
by
three
fingers
than
the
common
cubit
i
must
also
tell
in
addition
to
this
for
what
purpose
the
earth
was
used
which
was
taken
out
of
the
trench
and
in
what
manner
the
wall
was
made
as
they
dug
the
trench
they
made
the
earth
which
was
carried
out
of
the
excavation
into
bricks
and
having
moulded
enough
bricks
they
baked
them
in
kilns
and
then
afterwards
using
hot
asphalt
for
mortar
and
inserting
reed
mats
at
every
thirty
courses
of
brickwork
they
built
up
first
the
edges
of
the
trench
and
then
the
wall
itself
in
the
same
manner
and
at
the
top
of
the
wall
along
the
edges
they
built
chambers
of
one
story
facing
one
another
and
between
the
rows
of
chambers
they
left
space
to
drive
a
chariot
in
the
circuit
of
the
wall
there
are
set
a
hundred
gates
made
of
bronze
throughout
and
the
and
lintels
likewise
now
there
is
another
city
distant
from
babylon
a
space
of
eight
days
journey
of
which
the
name
is
is
and
there
is
a
river
there
of
no
great
size
and
the
name
of
the
river
is
also
is
and
it
sends
its
stream
into
the
river
euphrates
this
river
is
throws
up
together
with
its
water
lumps
of
asphalt
in
great
abundance
and
thence
was
brought
the
asphalt
for
the
wall
of
babylon
babylon
then
was
walled
in
this
manner
and
there
are
two
divisions
of
the
city
for
a
river
whose
name
is
euphrates
parts
it
in
the
middle
this
flows
from
the
land
of
the
armenians
and
is
large
and
deep
and
swift
and
it
flows
out
into
the
erythraian
sea
the
wall
then
on
each
side
has
its
bends
carried
down
to
the
river
and
from
this
point
the
walls
stretch
along
each
bank
of
the
stream
in
the
form
of
a
rampart
of
baked
bricks
and
the
city
itself
is
full
of
houses
of
three
and
four
stories
and
the
roads
by
which
it
is
cut
up
run
in
straight
lines
including
the
cross
roads
which
lead
to
the
river
and
opposite
to
each
road
there
were
set
gates
in
the
rampart
which
ran
along
the
river
in
many
in
number
as
the
ways
and
these
also
were
of
bronze
and
led
like
the
ways
to
the
river
itself
this
wall
then
which
i
have
mentioned
is
as
it
were
a
cuirass
for
the
town
and
another
wall
runs
round
within
it
not
much
weaker
for
defence
than
the
first
but
enclosing
a
smaller
space
and
in
each
division
of
the
city
was
a
building
in
the
midst
in
the
one
the
palace
of
great
extent
and
strongly
fortified
round
and
in
the
other
the
temple
of
zeus
belos
with
bronze
gates
and
this
exists
still
up
to
my
time
and
measures
two
furlongs
each
way
being
of
a
square
shape
and
in
the
midst
of
the
temple
is
built
a
solid
tower
measuring
a
furlong
both
in
length
and
in
breadth
and
on
this
tower
another
tower
has
been
erected
and
another
again
upon
this
and
so
on
up
to
the
number
of
eight
towers
an
ascent
to
these
has
been
built
running
outside
round
about
all
the
towers
and
when
one
reaches
about
the
middle
of
the
ascent
one
finds
a
and
seats
to
rest
upon
on
which
those
who
ascend
sit
down
and
rest
and
on
the
top
of
the
last
tower
there
is
a
large
cell
and
in
the
cell
a
large
couch
is
laid
well
covered
and
by
it
is
placed
a
golden
table
and
there
is
no
image
there
set
up
nor
does
any
human
being
spend
the
night
there
except
only
one
woman
of
the
natives
of
the
place
whomsoever
the
god
shall
choose
from
all
the
woman
as
say
the
chaldeans
who
are
the
priests
of
this
god
these
same
men
say
also
but
i
do
not
believe
them
that
the
god
himself
comes
often
to
the
cell
and
rests
upon
the
couch
as
happens
likewise
in
the
egyptian
thebes
according
to
the
report
of
the
egyptians
for
there
also
a
woman
sleeps
in
the
temple
of
the
theban
zeus
and
both
these
women
are
said
to
abstain
from
commerce
with
men
and
as
happens
also
with
the
prophetess
of
the
god
in
patara
of
lykia
whenever
there
is
one
for
there
is
not
always
an
oracle
there
but
whenever
there
is
one
then
she
is
shut
up
during
the
nights
in
the
temple
within
the
cell
there
is
moreover
in
the
temple
at
babylon
another
cell
below
wherein
is
a
great
image
of
zeus
sitting
made
of
gold
and
by
it
is
placed
a
large
table
of
gold
and
his
footstool
and
seat
are
of
gold
also
and
as
the
chaldeans
reported
the
weight
of
the
gold
of
which
these
things
are
made
is
eight
hundred
talents
outside
this
cell
is
an
altar
of
gold
and
there
is
also
another
altar
of
great
size
where
animals
are
sacrificed
whereas
on
the
golden
altar
it
is
not
lawful
to
sacrifice
any
but
young
sucklings
only
and
also
on
the
larger
altar
the
chaldeans
offer
one
thousand
talents
of
frankincense
every
year
at
the
time
when
they
celebrate
the
feast
in
honour
of
this
god
there
was
moreover
in
these
precincts
still
remaining
at
the
time
of
cyrus
a
statue
twelve
cubits
high
of
gold
and
solid
this
i
did
not
myself
see
but
that
which
is
related
by
the
chaldeans
i
relate
against
this
statue
dareios
the
son
of
hystaspes
formed
a
design
but
he
did
not
venture
to
take
it
it
was
taken
however
by
xerxes
the
son
of
dareios
who
also
killed
the
priest
when
he
forbade
him
to
meddle
with
the
statue
this
temple
then
is
thus
adorned
with
magnificence
and
there
are
also
many
private
of
this
babylon
besides
many
other
rulers
of
whom
i
shall
make
mention
in
the
assyrian
history
and
who
added
improvement
to
the
walls
and
temples
there
were
also
two
who
were
women
of
these
the
one
who
ruled
first
named
semiramis
who
lived
five
generations
before
the
other
produced
banks
of
earth
in
the
plain
which
are
a
sight
worth
seeing
and
before
this
the
river
used
to
flood
like
a
sea
over
the
whole
plain
the
queen
who
lived
after
her
time
named
nitocris
was
wiser
than
she
who
had
reigned
before
and
in
the
first
place
she
left
behind
her
monuments
which
i
shall
tell
of
then
secondly
seeing
that
the
monarchy
of
the
medes
was
great
and
not
apt
to
remain
still
but
that
besides
other
cities
even
nineveh
had
been
captured
by
it
she
made
provision
against
it
in
so
far
as
she
was
able
first
as
regards
the
river
euphrates
which
flows
through
the
midst
of
their
city
whereas
before
this
it
flowed
straight
she
by
digging
channels
above
made
it
so
winding
that
it
actually
comes
three
times
in
its
course
to
one
of
the
villages
in
assyria
and
the
name
of
the
village
to
which
the
euphrates
comes
is
ardericca
and
at
this
day
those
who
travel
from
this
sea
of
ours
to
babylon
in
their
voyage
down
the
river
euphrates
arrive
three
times
at
this
same
village
and
on
three
separate
days
this
she
did
thus
and
she
also
piled
up
a
mound
along
each
bank
of
the
river
which
is
worthy
to
cause
wonder
for
its
size
and
height
and
at
a
great
distance
above
babylon
she
dug
a
basin
for
a
lake
which
she
caused
to
extend
along
at
a
very
small
distance
from
the
river
excavating
it
everywhere
of
such
depth
as
to
come
to
water
and
making
the
extent
such
that
the
circuit
of
it
measured
four
hundred
and
twenty
furlongs
and
the
earth
which
was
dug
out
of
this
excavation
she
used
up
by
piling
it
in
mounds
along
the
banks
of
the
river
and
when
this
had
been
dug
by
her
she
brought
stones
and
set
them
all
round
it
as
a
facing
wall
both
these
two
things
she
did
that
is
she
made
the
river
to
have
a
winding
course
and
she
made
the
place
which
was
dug
out
all
into
a
swamp
in
order
that
the
river
might
run
more
slowly
having
its
force
broken
by
going
round
many
bends
and
that
the
voyages
might
be
winding
to
babylon
and
after
the
voyages
there
might
succeed
a
long
circuit
of
the
pool
these
works
she
carried
out
in
that
part
where
the
entrance
to
the
country
was
and
the
shortest
way
to
it
from
media
so
that
the
medes
might
not
have
dealings
with
her
kingdom
and
learn
of
her
affairs
these
defences
she
cast
round
her
city
from
the
depth
and
she
made
the
following
addition
which
was
dependent
upon
them
city
was
in
two
divisions
and
the
river
occupied
the
space
between
and
in
the
time
of
the
former
rulers
when
any
one
wished
to
pass
over
from
the
one
division
to
the
other
he
had
to
pass
over
in
a
boat
and
that
as
i
imagine
was
troublesome
she
however
made
provision
also
for
this
for
when
she
was
digging
the
basin
for
the
lake
she
left
this
other
monument
of
herself
derived
from
the
same
work
that
is
she
caused
stones
to
be
cut
of
very
great
length
and
when
the
stones
were
prepared
for
her
and
the
place
had
been
dug
out
she
turned
aside
the
whole
stream
of
the
river
into
the
place
which
she
had
been
digging
and
while
this
was
being
filled
with
water
the
ancient
bed
of
the
river
being
dried
up
in
the
meantime
she
both
built
up
with
baked
bricks
after
the
same
fashion
as
the
wall
the
edges
of
the
river
where
it
flows
through
the
city
and
the
places
of
descent
leading
from
the
small
gateways
to
the
river
and
also
about
the
middle
of
the
city
as
i
judge
with
the
stones
which
she
had
caused
to
be
dug
out
she
proceeded
to
build
a
bridge
binding
together
the
stones
with
iron
and
lead
and
upon
the
top
she
laid
squared
timbers
across
to
remain
there
while
it
was
daytime
over
which
the
people
of
babylon
made
the
passage
across
but
at
night
they
used
to
take
away
these
timbers
for
this
reason
namely
that
they
might
not
go
backwards
and
forwards
by
night
and
steal
from
one
another
and
when
the
place
dug
out
had
been
made
into
a
lake
full
of
water
by
the
river
and
at
the
same
time
the
bridge
had
been
completed
then
she
conducted
the
euphrates
back
into
its
ancient
channel
from
the
lake
and
so
the
place
dug
out
being
made
into
a
swamp
was
thought
to
have
served
a
good
purpose
and
there
had
been
a
bridge
set
up
for
the
men
of
the
city
this
same
queen
also
contrived
a
snare
of
the
following
kind
that
gate
of
the
city
through
which
the
greatest
number
of
people
passed
she
set
up
for
herself
a
tomb
above
the
very
gate
itself
and
on
the
tomb
she
engraved
writing
which
said
thus
if
any
of
the
kings
of
babylon
who
come
after
me
shall
be
in
want
of
wealth
let
him
open
my
tomb
and
take
as
much
as
he
desires
but
let
him
not
open
it
for
any
other
cause
if
he
be
not
in
want
for
that
will
not
be
well
this
tomb
was
undisturbed
until
the
kingdom
came
to
dareios
but
to
dareios
it
seemed
that
it
was
a
monstrous
thing
not
to
make
any
use
of
this
gate
and
also
when
there
was
money
lying
there
not
to
take
it
considering
that
the
money
itself
invited
him
to
do
so
now
the
reason
why
he
would
not
make
any
use
of
this
gate
was
because
the
corpse
would
have
been
above
his
head
as
he
drove
through
he
then
i
say
opened
the
tomb
and
found
not
indeed
money
but
the
corpse
with
writing
which
said
thus
if
thou
hadst
not
been
insatiable
of
wealth
and
basely
covetous
thou
wouldest
not
have
opened
the
of
the
dead
this
queen
then
is
reported
to
have
been
such
as
i
have
described
and
it
was
the
son
of
this
woman
bearing
the
same
name
as
his
father
labynetos
and
being
ruler
over
the
assyrians
against
whom
cyrus
was
marching
now
the
great
king
makes
his
marches
not
only
well
furnished
from
home
with
provisions
for
his
table
and
with
cattle
but
also
taking
with
him
water
from
the
river
choaspes
which
flows
by
susa
of
which
alone
and
of
no
other
river
the
king
drinks
and
of
this
water
of
the
choaspes
boiled
a
very
great
number
of
waggons
and
drawn
by
mules
carry
a
supply
in
silver
vessels
and
go
with
him
wherever
he
may
march
at
any
time
now
when
cyrus
on
his
way
towards
babylon
arrived
at
the
river
gyndes
which
river
the
springs
are
in
the
mountains
of
the
matienians
and
it
flows
through
the
dardanians
and
runs
into
another
river
the
tigris
which
flowing
by
the
city
of
opis
runs
out
into
the
erythraian
sea
cyrus
i
say
was
endeavouring
to
cross
this
river
gyndes
which
is
a
navigable
stream
then
one
of
his
sacred
white
horses
in
high
spirit
and
wantonness
went
into
the
river
and
endeavoured
to
cross
but
the
stream
swept
it
under
water
and
carried
it
off
forthwith
and
cyrus
was
greatly
moved
with
anger
against
the
river
for
having
done
thus
insolently
and
he
threatened
to
make
it
so
feeble
that
for
the
future
even
women
could
cross
it
easily
without
wetting
the
knee
so
after
this
threat
he
ceased
from
his
march
against
babylon
and
divided
his
army
into
two
parts
and
having
divided
it
he
stretched
lines
and
marked
out
straight
channels
one
hundred
and
eighty
on
each
bank
of
the
gyndes
directed
every
way
and
having
disposed
his
army
along
them
he
commanded
them
to
dig
so
as
a
great
multitude
was
working
the
work
was
completed
indeed
but
they
spent
the
whole
summer
season
at
this
spot
working
when
cyrus
had
taken
vengeance
on
the
river
gyndes
by
dividing
it
into
three
hundred
and
sixty
channels
and
when
the
next
spring
was
just
beginning
then
at
length
he
continued
his
advance
upon
babylon
and
the
men
of
babylon
had
marched
forth
out
of
their
city
and
were
awaiting
him
so
when
in
his
advance
he
came
near
to
the
city
the
babylonians
joined
battle
with
him
and
having
been
worsted
in
the
fight
they
were
shut
up
close
within
their
city
but
knowing
well
even
before
this
that
cyrus
was
not
apt
to
remain
still
and
seeing
him
lay
hands
on
every
nation
equally
they
had
brought
in
provisions
beforehand
for
very
many
years
so
while
these
made
no
account
of
the
siege
cyrus
was
in
straits
what
to
do
for
much
time
went
by
and
his
affairs
made
no
progress
onwards
therefore
whether
it
was
some
other
man
who
suggested
it
to
him
when
he
was
in
a
strait
what
to
do
or
whether
he
of
himself
perceived
what
he
ought
to
do
he
did
as
follows
main
body
of
his
army
he
posted
at
the
place
where
the
river
runs
into
the
city
and
then
again
behind
the
city
he
set
others
where
the
river
issues
forth
from
the
city
and
he
proclaimed
to
his
army
that
so
soon
as
they
should
see
that
the
stream
had
become
passable
they
should
enter
by
this
way
into
the
city
having
thus
set
them
in
their
places
and
in
this
manner
exhorted
them
he
marched
away
himself
with
that
part
of
his
army
which
was
not
fit
for
fighting
and
when
he
came
to
the
lake
cyrus
also
did
the
same
things
which
the
queen
of
the
babylonians
had
done
as
regards
the
river
and
the
lake
that
is
to
say
he
conducted
the
river
by
a
channel
into
the
lake
which
was
at
that
time
a
swamp
and
so
made
the
former
course
of
the
river
passable
by
the
sinking
of
the
stream
when
this
had
been
done
in
such
a
manner
the
persians
who
had
been
posted
for
this
very
purpose
entered
by
the
bed
of
the
river
euphrates
into
babylon
the
stream
having
sunk
so
far
that
it
reached
about
to
the
middle
of
a
thigh
now
if
the
babylonians
had
had
knowledge
of
it
beforehand
or
had
perceived
that
which
was
being
done
by
cyrus
they
would
have
allowed
the
persians
to
enter
the
city
and
then
destroyed
them
miserably
for
if
they
had
closed
all
the
gates
that
led
to
the
river
and
mounted
themselves
upon
the
ramparts
which
were
carried
along
the
banks
of
the
stream
they
would
have
caught
them
as
it
were
in
a
but
as
it
was
the
persians
came
upon
them
unexpectedly
and
owing
to
the
size
of
the
city
so
it
is
said
by
those
who
dwell
there
after
those
about
the
extremities
of
the
city
had
suffered
capture
those
babylonians
who
dwelt
in
the
middle
did
not
know
that
they
had
been
captured
but
as
they
chanced
to
be
holding
a
festival
they
went
on
dancing
and
rejoicing
during
this
time
until
they
learnt
the
truth
only
too
well
babylon
then
had
thus
been
taken
for
the
first
time
and
as
to
the
resources
of
the
babylonians
how
great
they
are
i
shall
show
by
many
other
proofs
and
among
them
also
by
this
the
support
of
the
great
king
and
his
army
apart
from
the
regular
tribute
the
whole
land
of
which
he
is
ruler
has
been
distributed
into
portions
now
whereas
twelve
months
go
to
make
up
the
year
for
four
of
these
he
has
his
support
from
the
territory
of
babylon
and
for
the
remaining
eight
months
from
the
whole
of
the
rest
of
asia
thus
the
assyrian
land
is
in
regard
to
resources
the
third
part
of
all
asia
and
the
government
or
satrapy
as
it
is
called
by
the
persians
of
this
territory
is
of
all
the
governments
by
far
the
best
seeing
that
when
tritantaichmes
son
of
artabazos
had
this
province
from
the
king
there
came
in
to
him
every
day
an
artab
full
of
silver
coin
now
the
artab
is
a
persian
measure
and
holds
more
than
the
medimnos
of
attica
by
three
attic
choinikes
and
of
horses
he
had
in
this
province
as
his
private
property
apart
from
the
horses
for
use
in
war
eight
hundred
stallions
and
sixteen
thousand
mares
for
each
of
these
stallions
served
twenty
mares
of
indian
hounds
moreover
such
a
vast
number
were
kept
that
four
large
villages
in
the
plain
being
free
from
other
contributions
had
been
appointed
to
provide
food
for
the
hounds
such
was
the
wealth
which
belonged
to
the
ruler
of
babylon
now
the
land
of
the
assyrians
has
but
little
rain
and
this
little
gives
nourishment
to
the
root
of
the
corn
but
the
crop
is
ripened
and
the
ear
comes
on
by
the
help
of
watering
from
the
river
not
as
in
egypt
by
the
coming
up
of
the
river
itself
over
the
fields
but
the
crop
is
watered
by
hand
or
with
for
the
whole
babylonian
territory
like
the
egyptian
is
cut
up
into
channels
and
the
largest
of
the
channels
is
navigable
for
ships
and
runs
in
the
direction
of
the
sunrising
in
winter
from
the
euphrates
to
another
river
namely
the
tigris
along
the
bank
of
which
lay
the
city
of
nineveh
this
territory
is
of
all
that
we
know
the
best
by
far
for
producing
corn
as
to
trees
it
does
not
even
attempt
to
bear
them
either
fig
or
vine
or
olive
but
for
producing
corn
it
is
so
good
that
it
s
as
much
as
for
the
average
and
when
it
bears
at
its
best
it
produces
the
leaves
of
the
wheat
and
barley
there
grow
to
be
full
four
fingers
broad
and
from
millet
and
sesame
seed
how
large
a
tree
grows
i
know
myself
but
shall
not
record
being
well
aware
that
even
what
has
already
been
said
relating
to
the
crops
produced
has
been
enough
to
cause
disbelief
in
those
who
have
not
visited
the
babylonian
land
they
use
no
oil
of
olives
but
only
that
which
they
make
of
sesame
seed
and
they
have
growing
over
all
the
plain
most
of
them
of
which
they
make
both
solid
food
and
wine
and
honey
and
to
these
they
attend
in
the
same
manner
as
to
and
in
particular
they
take
the
fruit
of
those
palms
which
the
hellenes
call
and
tie
them
upon
the
palms
so
that
their
may
enter
into
the
date
and
ripen
it
and
that
the
fruit
of
the
palm
may
not
fall
off
for
the
produces
in
its
fruit
just
as
the
does
but
the
greatest
marvel
of
all
the
things
in
the
land
after
the
city
itself
to
my
mind
is
this
which
i
am
about
to
tell
their
boats
those
i
mean
which
go
down
the
river
to
babylon
are
round
and
all
of
leather
for
they
make
ribs
for
them
of
willow
which
they
cut
in
the
land
of
the
armenians
who
dwell
above
the
assyrians
and
round
these
they
stretch
hides
which
serve
as
a
covering
outside
by
way
of
hull
not
making
broad
the
stern
nor
gathering
in
the
prow
to
a
point
but
making
the
boats
round
like
a
shield
and
after
that
they
stow
the
whole
boat
with
straw
and
suffer
it
to
be
carried
down
the
stream
full
of
cargo
and
for
the
most
part
these
boats
bring
down
casks
of
filled
with
wine
the
boat
is
kept
straight
by
two
and
two
men
standing
upright
and
the
man
inside
pulls
his
oar
while
the
man
outside
pushes
these
vessels
are
made
both
of
very
large
size
and
also
smaller
the
largest
of
them
having
a
burden
of
as
much
as
five
thousand
talents
weight
and
in
each
one
there
is
a
live
ass
and
in
those
of
larger
size
several
so
when
they
have
arrived
at
babylon
in
their
voyage
and
have
disposed
of
their
cargo
they
sell
by
auction
the
ribs
of
the
boat
and
all
the
straw
but
they
pack
the
hides
upon
their
asses
and
drive
them
off
to
armenia
for
up
the
stream
of
the
river
it
is
not
possible
by
any
means
to
sail
owing
to
the
swiftness
of
the
current
and
for
this
reason
they
make
their
boats
not
of
timber
but
of
hides
then
when
they
have
come
back
to
the
land
of
the
armenians
driving
their
asses
with
them
they
make
other
boats
in
the
same
manner
such
are
their
boats
and
the
following
is
the
manner
of
dress
which
they
use
namely
a
linen
tunic
reaching
to
the
feet
and
over
this
they
put
on
another
of
wool
and
then
a
white
mantle
thrown
round
while
they
have
shoes
of
a
native
fashion
rather
like
the
boeotian
slippers
they
wear
their
hair
long
and
bind
their
heads
round
with
fillets
and
they
are
anointed
over
the
whole
of
their
body
with
perfumes
each
man
has
a
seal
and
a
staff
carved
by
hand
and
on
each
staff
is
carved
either
an
apple
or
a
rose
or
a
lily
or
an
eagle
or
some
other
device
for
it
is
not
their
custom
to
have
a
staff
without
a
device
upon
it
such
is
the
equipment
of
their
bodies
and
the
customs
which
are
established
among
them
are
as
follows
the
wisest
in
our
opinion
being
this
which
i
am
informed
that
the
enetoi
in
illyria
also
have
in
every
village
once
in
each
year
it
was
done
as
follows
the
maidens
grew
to
the
age
for
marriage
they
gathered
these
all
together
and
brought
them
in
a
body
to
one
place
and
round
them
stood
a
company
of
men
and
the
crier
caused
each
one
severally
to
stand
up
and
proceeded
to
sell
them
first
the
most
comely
of
all
and
afterwards
when
she
had
been
sold
and
had
fetched
a
large
sum
of
money
he
would
put
up
another
who
was
the
most
comely
after
her
and
they
were
sold
for
marriage
now
all
the
wealthy
men
of
the
babylonians
who
were
ready
to
marry
vied
with
one
another
in
bidding
for
the
most
beautiful
maidens
those
however
of
the
common
sort
who
were
ready
to
marry
did
not
require
a
fine
form
but
they
would
accept
money
together
with
less
comely
maidens
for
when
the
crier
had
made
an
end
of
selling
the
most
comely
of
the
maidens
then
he
would
cause
to
stand
up
that
one
who
was
least
shapely
or
any
one
of
them
who
might
be
crippled
in
any
way
and
he
would
make
proclamation
of
her
asking
who
was
willing
for
least
gold
to
have
her
in
marriage
until
she
was
assigned
to
him
who
was
willing
to
accept
least
and
the
gold
would
be
got
from
the
sale
of
the
comely
maidens
and
so
those
of
beautiful
form
provided
dowries
for
those
which
were
unshapely
or
crippled
but
to
give
in
marriage
one
own
daughter
to
whomsoever
each
man
would
was
not
allowed
nor
to
carry
off
the
maiden
after
buying
her
without
a
surety
for
it
was
necessary
for
the
man
to
provide
sureties
that
he
would
marry
her
before
he
took
her
away
and
if
they
did
not
agree
well
together
the
law
was
laid
down
that
he
should
pay
back
the
money
it
was
allowed
also
for
any
one
who
wished
it
to
come
from
another
village
and
buy
this
then
was
their
most
honourable
custom
it
does
not
however
still
exist
at
the
present
time
but
they
have
found
out
of
late
another
way
in
order
that
the
men
may
not
them
or
take
them
to
another
city
for
since
the
time
when
being
conquered
they
were
oppressed
and
ruined
each
one
of
the
common
people
when
he
is
in
want
of
livelihood
prostitutes
his
female
children
next
in
wisdom
to
that
is
this
other
custom
which
was
established
among
them
bear
out
the
sick
into
the
for
of
physicians
they
make
no
use
so
people
come
up
to
the
sick
man
and
give
advice
about
his
disease
if
any
one
himself
has
ever
suffered
anything
like
that
which
the
sick
man
has
or
saw
any
other
who
had
suffered
it
and
coming
near
they
advise
and
recommend
those
means
by
which
they
themselves
got
rid
of
a
like
disease
or
seen
some
other
get
rid
of
it
and
to
pass
by
the
sick
man
in
silence
is
not
permitted
to
them
nor
until
one
has
asked
what
disease
he
has
they
bury
their
dead
in
honey
and
their
modes
of
lamentation
are
similar
to
those
used
in
egypt
and
whenever
a
babylonian
man
has
intercourse
with
his
wife
he
sits
by
incense
offered
and
his
wife
does
the
same
on
the
other
side
and
when
it
is
morning
they
wash
themselves
both
of
them
for
they
will
touch
no
vessel
until
they
have
washed
themselves
and
the
arabians
do
likewise
in
this
matter
now
the
most
shameful
of
the
customs
of
the
babylonians
is
as
follows
every
woman
of
the
country
must
sit
down
in
the
precincts
of
aphrodite
once
in
her
life
and
have
commerce
with
a
man
who
is
a
stranger
and
many
women
who
do
not
deign
to
mingle
with
the
rest
because
they
are
made
arrogant
by
wealth
drive
to
the
temple
with
pairs
of
horses
in
covered
carriages
and
so
take
their
place
and
a
large
number
of
attendants
follow
after
them
but
the
greater
number
do
thus
the
sacred
enclosure
of
aphrodite
sit
great
numbers
of
women
with
a
wreath
of
cord
about
their
heads
some
come
and
others
go
and
there
are
passages
in
straight
lines
going
between
the
women
in
every
direction
through
which
the
strangers
pass
by
and
make
their
choice
here
when
a
woman
takes
her
seat
she
does
not
depart
again
to
her
house
until
one
of
the
strangers
has
thrown
a
silver
coin
into
her
lap
and
has
had
commerce
with
her
outside
the
temple
and
after
throwing
it
he
must
say
these
words
only
i
demand
thee
in
the
name
of
the
goddess
mylitta
now
mylitta
is
the
name
given
by
the
assyrians
to
aphrodite
and
the
silver
coin
may
be
of
any
value
whatever
it
is
she
will
not
refuse
it
for
that
is
not
lawful
for
her
seeing
that
this
coin
is
made
sacred
by
the
act
and
she
follows
the
man
who
has
first
thrown
and
does
not
reject
any
and
after
that
she
departs
to
her
house
having
acquitted
herself
of
her
duty
to
the
goddess
nor
will
you
be
able
thenceforth
to
give
any
gift
so
great
as
to
win
her
so
then
as
many
as
have
attained
to
beauty
and
stature
are
speedily
released
but
those
of
them
who
are
unshapely
remain
there
much
time
not
being
able
to
fulfil
the
law
for
some
of
them
remain
even
as
much
as
three
or
four
years
and
in
some
parts
of
cyprus
too
there
is
a
custom
similar
to
this
these
customs
then
are
established
among
the
babylonians
and
there
are
of
them
three
tribes
which
eat
nothing
but
fish
only
and
when
they
have
caught
them
and
dried
them
in
the
sun
they
do
thus
throw
them
into
brine
and
then
pound
them
with
pestles
and
strain
them
through
muslin
and
they
have
them
for
food
either
kneaded
into
a
soft
cake
or
baked
like
bread
according
to
their
liking
when
this
nation
also
had
been
subdued
by
cyrus
he
had
a
desire
to
bring
the
massagetai
into
subjection
to
himself
this
nation
is
reputed
to
be
both
great
and
warlike
and
to
dwell
towards
the
east
and
the
sunrising
beyond
the
river
araxes
and
over
against
the
issedonians
and
some
also
say
that
this
nation
is
of
scythian
race
now
the
araxes
is
said
by
some
to
be
larger
and
by
others
to
be
smaller
than
the
ister
and
they
say
that
there
are
many
islands
in
it
about
equal
in
size
to
lesbos
and
in
them
people
dwelling
who
feed
in
the
summer
upon
roots
of
all
kinds
which
they
dig
up
and
certain
fruits
from
trees
which
have
been
discovered
by
them
for
food
they
store
up
it
is
said
in
the
season
when
they
are
ripe
and
feed
upon
them
in
the
winter
moreover
it
is
said
that
other
trees
have
been
discovered
by
them
which
yield
fruit
of
such
a
kind
that
when
they
have
assembled
together
in
companies
in
the
same
place
and
lighted
a
fire
they
sit
round
in
a
circle
and
throw
some
of
it
into
the
fire
and
they
smell
the
fruit
which
is
thrown
on
as
it
burns
and
are
intoxicated
by
the
scent
as
the
hellenes
are
with
wine
and
when
more
of
the
fruit
is
thrown
on
they
become
more
intoxicated
until
at
last
they
rise
up
to
dance
and
begin
to
sing
this
is
said
to
be
their
manner
of
living
and
as
to
the
river
araxes
it
flows
from
the
land
of
the
matienians
whence
flows
the
gyndes
which
cyrus
divided
into
the
three
hundred
and
sixty
channels
and
it
discharges
itself
by
forty
branches
of
which
all
except
one
end
in
swamps
and
shallow
pools
and
among
them
they
say
that
men
dwell
who
feed
on
fish
eaten
raw
and
who
are
wont
to
use
as
clothing
the
skins
of
seals
but
the
one
remaining
branch
of
the
araxes
flows
with
unimpeded
course
into
the
caspian
sea
now
the
caspian
sea
is
apart
by
itself
not
having
connection
with
the
other
sea
for
all
that
sea
which
the
hellenes
navigate
and
the
sea
beyond
the
pillars
which
is
called
atlantis
and
the
erythraian
sea
are
in
fact
all
one
but
the
caspian
is
separate
and
lies
apart
by
itself
in
length
it
is
a
voyage
of
fifteen
days
if
one
uses
oars
and
in
breadth
where
it
is
broadest
a
voyage
of
eight
days
on
the
side
towards
the
west
of
this
sea
the
caucasus
runs
along
by
it
which
is
of
all
both
the
greatest
in
extent
and
the
loftiest
and
the
caucasus
has
many
various
races
of
men
dwelling
in
it
living
for
the
most
part
on
the
wild
produce
of
the
forests
and
among
them
there
are
said
to
be
trees
which
produce
leaves
of
such
a
kind
that
by
pounding
them
and
mixing
water
with
them
they
paint
figures
upon
their
garments
and
the
figures
do
not
wash
out
but
grow
old
with
the
woollen
stuff
as
if
they
had
been
woven
into
it
at
the
first
and
men
say
that
the
sexual
intercourse
of
these
people
is
open
like
that
of
cattle
on
the
west
then
of
this
sea
which
is
called
caspian
the
caucasus
is
the
boundary
while
towards
the
east
and
the
rising
sun
a
plain
succeeds
which
is
of
limitless
extent
to
the
view
of
this
great
plain
then
the
massagetai
occupy
a
large
part
against
whom
cyrus
had
become
eager
to
march
for
there
were
many
strong
reasons
which
incited
him
to
it
and
urged
him
onwards
the
manner
of
his
birth
that
is
to
say
the
opinion
held
of
him
that
he
was
more
than
a
mere
mortal
man
and
next
the
success
which
he
had
met
with
in
his
wars
for
whithersoever
cyrus
directed
his
march
it
was
impossible
for
that
nation
to
escape
now
the
ruler
of
the
massagetai
was
a
woman
who
was
queen
after
the
death
of
her
husband
and
her
name
was
tomyris
to
her
cyrus
sent
and
wooed
her
pretending
that
he
desired
to
have
her
for
his
wife
but
tomyris
understanding
that
he
was
wooing
not
herself
but
rather
the
kingdom
of
the
massagetai
rejected
his
approaches
and
cyrus
after
this
as
he
made
no
progress
by
craft
marched
to
the
araxes
and
proceeded
to
make
an
expedition
openly
against
the
massagetai
forming
bridges
of
boats
over
the
river
for
his
army
to
cross
and
building
towers
upon
the
vessels
which
gave
them
passage
across
the
river
while
he
was
busied
about
this
labour
tomyris
sent
a
herald
and
said
thus
o
king
of
the
medes
cease
to
press
forward
the
work
which
thou
art
now
pressing
forward
for
thou
canst
not
tell
whether
these
things
will
be
in
the
end
for
thy
advantage
or
no
cease
to
do
so
i
say
and
be
king
over
thine
own
people
and
endure
to
see
us
ruling
those
whom
we
rule
since
however
i
know
that
thou
wilt
not
be
willing
to
receive
this
counsel
but
dost
choose
anything
rather
than
to
be
at
rest
therefore
if
thou
art
greatly
anxious
to
make
trial
of
the
massagetai
in
fight
come
now
leave
that
labour
which
thou
hast
in
yoking
together
the
banks
of
the
river
and
cross
over
into
our
land
when
we
have
first
withdrawn
three
days
journey
from
the
river
or
if
thou
desirest
rather
to
receive
us
into
your
land
do
thou
this
same
thing
thyself
having
heard
this
cyrus
called
together
the
first
men
among
the
persians
and
having
gathered
these
together
he
laid
the
matter
before
them
for
discussion
asking
their
advice
as
to
which
of
the
two
things
he
should
do
and
their
opinions
all
agreed
in
one
bidding
him
receive
tomyris
and
her
army
into
his
country
but
croesus
the
lydian
being
present
and
finding
fault
with
this
opinion
declared
an
opinion
opposite
to
that
which
had
been
set
forth
saying
as
follows
o
king
i
told
thee
in
former
time
also
that
since
zeus
had
given
me
over
to
thee
i
would
avert
according
to
my
power
whatever
occasion
of
falling
i
might
see
coming
near
thy
house
and
now
my
sufferings
which
have
been
bitter
have
proved
to
be
lessons
of
wisdom
to
me
if
thou
dost
suppose
that
thou
art
immortal
and
that
thou
dost
command
an
army
which
is
also
immortal
it
will
be
of
no
use
for
me
to
declare
to
thee
my
judgment
but
if
thou
hast
perceived
that
thou
art
a
mortal
man
thyself
and
dost
command
others
who
are
so
likewise
then
learn
this
first
that
for
the
affairs
of
men
there
is
a
revolving
wheel
and
that
this
in
its
revolution
suffers
not
the
same
persons
always
to
have
good
fortune
i
therefore
now
have
an
opinion
about
the
matter
laid
before
us
which
is
opposite
to
that
of
these
men
for
if
we
shall
consent
to
receive
the
enemy
into
our
land
there
is
for
thee
this
danger
in
so
doing
thou
shalt
be
worsted
thou
wilt
lose
in
addition
all
thy
realm
for
it
is
evident
that
if
the
massagetai
are
victors
they
will
not
turn
back
and
fly
but
will
march
upon
the
provinces
of
thy
realm
and
on
the
other
hand
if
thou
shalt
be
the
victor
thou
wilt
not
be
victor
so
fully
as
if
thou
shouldest
overcome
the
massagetai
after
crossing
over
into
their
land
and
shouldest
pursue
them
when
they
fled
for
against
that
which
i
said
before
i
will
set
the
same
again
here
and
say
that
thou
when
thou
hast
conquered
wilt
march
straight
against
the
realm
of
tomyris
moreover
besides
that
which
has
been
said
it
is
a
disgrace
and
not
to
be
endured
that
cyrus
the
son
of
cambyses
should
yield
to
a
woman
and
so
withdraw
from
her
land
now
therefore
it
seems
good
to
me
that
we
should
cross
over
and
go
forward
from
the
crossing
as
far
as
they
go
in
their
retreat
and
endeavour
to
get
the
better
of
them
by
doing
as
follows
massagetai
as
i
am
informed
are
without
experience
of
persian
good
things
and
have
never
enjoyed
any
great
luxuries
cut
up
therefore
cattle
without
stint
and
dress
the
meat
and
set
out
for
these
men
a
banquet
in
our
camp
moreover
also
provide
without
stint
bowls
of
unmixed
wine
and
provisions
of
every
kind
and
having
so
done
leave
behind
the
most
worthless
part
of
thy
army
and
let
the
rest
begin
to
retreat
from
the
camp
towards
the
river
for
if
i
am
not
mistaken
in
my
judgment
they
when
they
see
a
quantity
of
good
things
will
fall
to
the
feast
and
after
that
it
remains
for
us
to
display
great
deeds
these
were
the
conflicting
opinions
and
cyrus
letting
go
the
former
opinion
and
choosing
that
of
croesus
gave
notice
to
tomyris
to
retire
as
he
was
intending
to
cross
over
to
her
she
then
proceeded
to
retire
as
she
had
at
first
engaged
to
do
but
cyrus
delivered
croesus
into
the
hands
of
his
son
cambyses
to
whom
he
meant
to
give
the
kingdom
and
gave
him
charge
earnestly
to
honour
him
and
to
treat
him
well
if
the
crossing
over
to
go
against
the
massagetai
should
not
be
prosperous
having
thus
charged
him
and
sent
these
away
to
the
land
of
the
persians
he
crossed
over
the
river
both
himself
and
his
army
and
when
he
had
passed
over
the
araxes
night
having
come
on
he
saw
a
vision
in
his
sleep
in
the
land
of
the
massagetai
as
follows
his
sleep
it
seemed
to
cyrus
that
he
saw
the
eldest
of
the
sons
of
hystaspes
having
upon
his
shoulders
wings
and
that
with
the
one
of
these
he
overshadowed
asia
and
with
the
other
europe
now
of
hystaspes
the
son
of
arsames
who
was
a
man
of
the
achaimenid
clan
the
eldest
son
was
dareios
who
was
then
i
suppose
a
youth
of
about
twenty
years
of
age
and
he
had
been
left
behind
in
the
land
of
the
persians
for
he
was
not
yet
of
full
age
to
go
out
to
the
wars
so
then
when
cyrus
awoke
he
considered
with
himself
concerning
the
vision
and
as
the
vision
seemed
to
him
to
be
of
great
import
he
called
hystaspes
and
having
taken
him
apart
by
himself
he
said
hystaspes
thy
son
has
been
found
plotting
against
me
and
against
my
throne
and
how
i
know
this
for
certain
i
will
declare
to
thee
gods
have
a
care
of
me
and
show
me
beforehand
all
the
evils
that
threaten
me
so
in
the
night
that
is
past
while
sleeping
i
saw
the
eldest
of
thy
sons
having
upon
his
shoulders
wings
and
with
the
one
of
these
he
overshadowed
asia
and
with
the
other
europe
to
judge
by
this
vision
then
it
can
not
be
but
that
he
is
plotting
against
me
do
thou
therefore
go
by
the
quickest
way
back
to
persia
and
take
care
that
when
i
thither
after
having
subdued
these
regions
thou
set
thy
son
before
me
to
be
examined
cyrus
said
thus
supposing
that
dareios
was
plotting
against
him
but
in
fact
the
divine
powers
were
showing
him
beforehand
that
he
was
destined
to
find
his
end
there
and
that
his
kingdom
was
coming
about
to
dareios
to
this
then
hystaspes
replied
as
follows
o
king
heaven
forbid
that
there
should
be
any
man
of
persian
race
who
would
plot
against
thee
and
if
there
be
any
i
pray
that
he
perish
as
quickly
as
may
be
seeing
that
thou
didst
make
the
persians
to
be
free
instead
of
slaves
and
to
rule
all
nations
instead
of
being
ruled
by
others
and
if
any
vision
announces
to
thee
that
my
son
is
planning
rebellion
against
thee
i
deliver
him
over
to
thee
to
do
with
him
whatsoever
thou
wilt
hystaspes
then
having
made
answer
with
these
words
and
having
crossed
over
the
araxes
was
going
his
way
to
the
persian
land
to
keep
watch
over
his
son
dareios
for
cyrus
and
cyrus
meanwhile
went
forward
and
made
a
march
of
one
day
from
the
araxes
according
to
the
suggestion
of
croesus
after
this
when
cyrus
and
the
best
part
of
the
army
of
the
persians
had
marched
back
to
the
araxes
and
those
who
were
unfit
for
fighting
had
been
left
behind
then
a
third
part
of
the
army
of
the
massagetai
came
to
the
attack
and
proceeded
to
slay
not
without
resistance
those
who
were
left
behind
of
the
army
of
cyrus
and
seeing
the
feast
that
was
set
forth
when
they
had
overcome
their
enemies
they
lay
down
and
feasted
and
being
satiated
with
food
and
wine
they
went
to
sleep
then
the
persians
came
upon
them
and
slew
many
of
them
and
took
alive
many
more
even
than
they
slew
and
among
these
the
son
of
the
queen
tomyris
who
was
leading
the
army
of
the
massagetai
and
his
name
was
spargapises
she
then
when
she
heard
that
which
had
come
to
pass
concerning
the
army
and
also
the
things
concerning
her
son
sent
a
herald
to
cyrus
and
said
as
follows
cyrus
insatiable
of
blood
be
not
elated
with
pride
by
this
which
has
come
to
pass
namely
because
with
that
fruit
of
the
vine
with
which
ye
fill
yourselves
and
become
so
mad
that
as
the
wine
descends
into
your
bodies
evil
words
float
up
upon
its
stream
setting
a
snare
i
say
with
such
a
drug
as
this
thou
didst
overcome
my
son
and
not
by
valour
in
fight
now
therefore
receive
the
word
which
i
utter
giving
thee
good
advice
to
me
my
son
and
depart
from
this
land
without
penalty
triumphant
over
a
third
part
of
the
army
of
the
massagetai
but
if
thou
shalt
not
do
so
i
swear
to
thee
by
the
sun
who
is
lord
of
the
massagetai
that
surely
i
will
give
thee
thy
fill
of
blood
insatiable
as
thou
art
when
these
words
were
reported
to
him
cyrus
made
no
account
of
them
and
the
son
of
the
queen
tomyris
spargapises
when
the
wine
left
him
and
he
learnt
in
what
evil
case
he
was
entreated
cyrus
that
he
might
be
loosed
from
his
chains
and
gained
his
request
and
then
so
soon
as
he
was
loosed
and
had
got
power
over
his
hands
he
put
himself
to
death
he
then
ended
his
life
in
this
manner
but
tomyris
as
cyrus
did
not
listen
to
her
gathered
together
all
her
power
and
joined
battle
with
cyrus
this
battle
of
all
the
battles
fought
by
barbarians
i
judge
to
have
been
the
fiercest
and
i
am
informed
that
it
happened
thus
it
is
said
they
stood
apart
and
shot
at
one
another
and
afterwards
when
their
arrows
were
all
shot
away
they
fell
upon
one
another
and
engaged
in
close
combat
with
their
spears
and
daggers
and
so
they
continued
to
be
in
conflict
with
one
another
for
a
long
time
and
neither
side
would
flee
but
at
last
the
massagetai
got
the
better
in
the
fight
and
the
greater
part
of
the
persian
army
was
destroyed
there
on
the
spot
and
cyrus
himself
brought
his
life
to
an
end
there
after
he
had
reigned
in
all
thirty
years
wanting
one
then
tomyris
filled
a
skin
with
human
blood
and
had
search
made
among
the
persian
dead
for
the
corpse
of
cyrus
and
when
she
found
it
she
let
his
head
down
into
the
skin
and
doing
outrage
to
the
corpse
she
said
at
the
same
time
this
though
i
yet
live
and
have
overcome
thee
in
fight
nevertheless
thou
didst
undo
me
by
taking
my
son
with
craft
but
i
according
to
my
threat
will
give
thee
thy
fill
of
blood
now
as
regards
the
end
of
the
life
of
cyrus
there
are
many
tales
told
but
this
which
i
have
related
is
to
my
mind
the
most
worthy
of
belief
as
to
the
massagetai
they
wear
a
dress
which
is
similar
to
that
of
the
scythians
and
they
have
a
manner
of
life
which
is
also
like
theirs
and
there
are
of
them
horsemen
and
also
men
who
do
not
ride
on
horses
for
they
have
both
fashions
and
moreover
there
are
both
archers
and
spearmen
and
their
custom
it
is
to
carry
and
for
everything
they
use
either
gold
or
bronze
for
in
all
that
has
to
do
with
or
or
they
use
bronze
but
for
and
girdles
and
belts
round
the
they
employ
gold
as
ornament
and
in
like
manner
as
regards
their
horses
they
put
of
bronze
about
their
chests
but
on
their
bridles
and
bits
and
they
employ
gold
iron
however
and
silver
they
use
not
at
all
for
they
have
them
not
in
their
land
but
gold
and
bronze
in
abundance
these

by

his

come

him

then
after

boil
the

banquet

him
who
has
ended
his

they
do
not
eat

cover
him

it
a

that
he
did
not
attain
to
being
slaughtered

sow
no
crops

live
on

and
on

being
the

the
daughter
of

for
whose
death
which
came
about

his

had

also
had
proclaimed
to
all
those
over
whom
he
bore
rule
that
they
should
make
mourning
for
her

i
say
being
the
son
of
this
woman
and
of
cyrus
regarded
the
ionians
and
aiolians
as
slaves
inherited
from
his
father
and
he
proceeded
to
march
an
army
against
egypt
taking
with
him
as
helpers
not
only
the
other
nations
of
which
he
was
the
ruler
but
also
those
of
the
hellenes
over
whom
he
had
power
besides
now
the
egyptians
before
the
time
when
psammetichos
became
king
over
them
were
wont
to
suppose
that
they
had
come
into
being
first
of
all
men
but
since
the
time
when
psammetichos
having
become
king
desired
to
know
what
men
had
come
into
being
first
they
suppose
that
the
phrygians
came
into
being
before
themselves
but
they
themselves
before
all
other
men
now
psammetichos
when
he
was
not
able
by
inquiry
to
find
out
any
means
of
knowing
who
had
come
into
being
first
of
all
men
contrived
a
device
of
the
following
kind
two
children
belonging
to
persons
of
the
common
sort
he
gave
them
to
a
shepherd
to
bring
up
at
the
place
where
his
flocks
were
with
a
manner
of
bringing
up
such
as
i
shall
say
charging
him
namely
that
no
man
should
utter
any
word
in
their
presence
and
that
they
should
be
placed
by
themselves
in
a
room
where
none
might
come
and
at
the
proper
time
he
should
bring
to
them
and
when
he
had
satisfied
them
with
milk
he
should
do
for
them
whatever
else
was
needed
these
things
psammetichos
did
and
gave
him
this
charge
wishing
to
hear
what
word
the
children
would
let
break
forth
first
after
they
had
ceased
from
wailings
without
sense
and
accordingly
so
it
came
to
pass
for
after
a
space
of
two
years
had
gone
by
during
which
the
shepherd
went
on
acting
so
at
length
when
he
opened
the
door
and
entered
both
the
children
fell
before
him
in
entreaty
and
uttered
the
word
bekos
stretching
forth
their
hands
at
first
when
he
heard
this
the
shepherd
kept
silence
but
since
this
word
was
often
repeated
as
he
visited
them
constantly
and
attended
to
them
at
last
he
declared
the
matter
to
his
master
and
at
his
command
he
brought
the
children
before
his
face
then
psammetichos
having
himself
also
heard
it
began
to
inquire
about
what
nation
of
men
named
anything
bekos
and
inquiring
he
found
that
the
phrygians
had
this
name
for
bread
in
this
manner
and
guided
by
an
indication
such
as
this
the
egyptians
were
brought
to
allow
that
the
phrygians
were
a
more
ancient
people
than
themselves
that
so
it
came
to
pass
i
heard
from
the
priests
of
that
hephaistos
who
dwells
at
memphis
but
the
hellenes
relate
besides
many
other
idle
tales
that
psammetichos
cut
out
the
tongues
of
certain
women
and
then
caused
the
children
to
live
with
these
women
with
regard
then
to
the
rearing
of
the
children
they
related
so
much
as
i
have
said
and
i
heard
also
other
things
at
memphis
when
i
had
speech
with
the
priests
of
hephaistos
moreover
i
visited
both
thebes
and
heliopolis
for
this
very
cause
namely
because
i
wished
to
know
whether
the
priests
at
these
places
would
agree
in
their
accounts
with
those
at
memphis
for
the
men
of
heliopolis
are
said
to
be
the
most
learned
in
records
of
the
egyptians
those
of
their
narrations
which
i
heard
with
regard
to
the
gods
i
am
not
earnest
to
relate
in
full
but
i
shall
name
them
only
because
i
consider
that
all
men
are
equally
ignorant
of
these
matters
and
whatever
things
of
them
i
may
record
i
shall
record
only
because
i
am
compelled
by
the
course
of
the
story
but
as
to
those
matters
which
concern
men
the
priests
agreed
with
one
another
in
saying
that
the
egyptians
were
the
first
of
all
men
on
earth
to
find
out
the
course
of
the
year
having
divided
the
seasons
into
twelve
parts
to
make
up
the
whole
and
this
they
said
they
found
out
from
the
stars
and
they
reckon
to
this
extent
more
wisely
than
the
hellenes
as
it
seems
to
me
inasmuch
as
the
hellenes
throw
in
an
intercalated
month
every
other
year
to
make
the
seasons
right
whereas
the
egyptians
reckoning
the
twelve
months
at
thirty
days
each
bring
in
also
every
year
five
days
beyond
the
number
and
thus
the
circle
of
their
seasons
is
completed
and
comes
round
to
the
same
point
whence
it
set
out
they
said
moreover
that
the
egyptians
were
the
first
who
brought
into
use
appellations
for
the
twelve
gods
and
the
hellenes
took
up
the
use
from
them
and
that
they
were
the
first
who
assigned
altars
and
images
and
temples
to
the
gods
and
who
engraved
figures
on
stones
and
with
regard
to
the
greater
number
of
these
things
they
showed
me
by
actual
facts
that
they
had
happened
so
they
said
also
that
the
first
man
who
became
king
of
egypt
was
min
and
that
in
his
time
all
egypt
except
the
district
of
thebes
was
a
swamp
and
none
of
the
regions
were
then
above
water
which
now
lie
below
the
lake
of
moiris
to
which
lake
it
is
a
voyage
of
seven
days
up
the
river
from
the
sea
and
i
thought
that
they
said
well
about
the
land
for
it
is
manifest
in
truth
even
to
a
person
who
has
not
heard
it
beforehand
but
has
only
seen
at
least
if
he
have
understanding
that
the
egypt
to
which
the
hellenes
come
in
ships
is
a
land
which
has
been
won
by
the
egyptians
as
an
addition
and
that
it
is
a
gift
of
the
river
moreover
the
regions
which
lie
above
this
lake
also
for
a
distance
of
three
days
sail
about
which
they
did
not
go
on
to
say
anything
of
this
kind
are
nevertheless
another
instance
of
the
same
thing
for
the
nature
of
the
land
of
egypt
is
as
follows
when
you
are
still
approaching
it
in
a
ship
and
are
distant
a
day
run
from
the
land
if
you
let
down
a
you
will
bring
up
mud
and
will
find
yourself
in
eleven
fathoms
this
then
so
far
shows
that
there
is
a
silting
forward
of
the
land
then
secondly
as
to
egypt
itself
the
extent
of
it
along
the
sea
is
sixty
schoines
according
to
our
definition
of
egypt
as
extending
from
the
gulf
of
plinthine
to
the
serbonian
lake
along
which
stretches
mount
casion
from
this
lake
then
the
sixty
schoines
are
reckoned
for
those
of
men
who
are
poor
in
land
have
their
country
measured
by
fathoms
those
who
are
less
poor
by
furlongs
those
who
have
much
land
by
parasangs
and
those
who
have
land
in
very
great
abundance
by
schoines
now
the
parasang
is
equal
to
thirty
furlongs
and
each
schoine
which
is
an
egyptian
measure
is
equal
to
sixty
furlongs
so
there
would
be
an
extent
of
three
thousand
six
hundred
furlongs
for
the
of
egypt
from
thence
and
as
far
as
heliopolis
inland
egypt
is
broad
and
the
land
is
all
flat
and
without
springs
of
water
and
formed
of
mud
and
the
road
as
one
goes
inland
from
the
sea
to
heliopolis
is
about
the
same
in
length
as
that
which
leads
from
the
altar
of
the
twelve
gods
at
athens
to
pisa
and
the
temple
of
olympian
zeus
reckoning
up
you
would
find
the
difference
very
small
by
which
these
roads
fail
of
being
equal
in
length
not
more
indeed
than
fifteen
furlongs
for
the
road
from
athens
to
pisa
wants
fifteen
furlongs
of
being
fifteen
hundred
while
the
road
to
heliopolis
from
the
sea
reaches
that
number
completely
from
heliopolis
however
as
you
go
up
egypt
is
narrow
for
on
the
one
side
a
belonging
to
arabia
stretches
along
by
the
side
of
it
going
in
a
direction
from
north
towards
the
midday
and
the
south
wind
tending
upwards
without
a
break
to
that
which
is
called
the
erythraian
sea
in
which
range
are
the
which
were
used
in
cutting
stone
for
the
pyramids
at
memphis
on
this
side
then
the
mountain
ends
where
i
have
said
and
then
takes
a
turn
back
and
where
it
is
widest
as
i
was
informed
it
is
a
journey
of
two
months
across
from
east
to
west
and
the
borders
of
it
which
turn
towards
the
east
are
said
to
produce
frankincense
such
then
is
the
nature
of
this
and
on
the
side
of
egypt
towards
libya
another
range
extends
rocky
and
enveloped
in
sand
in
this
are
the
pyramids
and
it
runs
in
the
same
direction
as
those
parts
of
the
arabian
mountains
which
go
towards
the
midday
so
then
i
say
from
heliopolis
the
land
has
no
longer
a
great
extent
so
far
as
it
belongs
to
egypt
and
for
about
four
days
sail
up
the
river
egypt
properly
so
called
is
narrow
and
the
space
between
the
which
have
been
mentioned
is
but
where
it
is
narrowest
it
did
not
seem
to
me
to
exceed
two
hundred
furlongs
from
the
arabian
mountains
to
those
which
are
called
the
libyan
after
this
again
egypt
is
broad
such
is
the
nature
of
this
land
and
from
heliopolis
to
thebes
is
a
voyage
up
the
river
of
nine
days
and
the
distance
of
the
journey
in
furlongs
is
four
thousand
eight
hundred
and
sixty
the
number
of
the
schoines
being
if
these
measures
of
egypt
in
furlongs
be
put
together
the
result
is
as
follows
have
already
before
this
shown
that
the
distance
along
the
sea
amounts
to
three
thousand
six
hundred
furlongs
and
i
will
now
declare
what
the
distance
is
inland
from
the
sea
to
thebes
namely
six
thousand
one
hundred
and
twenty
furlongs
and
again
the
distance
from
thebes
to
the
city
called
elephantine
is
one
thousand
eight
hundred
furlongs
of
this
land
then
concerning
which
i
have
spoken
it
seemed
to
myself
also
according
as
the
priests
said
that
the
greater
part
had
been
won
as
an
addition
by
the
egyptians
for
it
was
evident
to
me
that
the
space
between
the
aforesaid
which
lie
above
the
city
of
memphis
once
was
a
gulf
of
the
sea
like
the
regions
about
ilion
and
teuthrania
and
ephesos
and
the
plain
of
the
maiander
if
it
be
permitted
to
compare
small
things
with
great
and
small
these
are
in
comparison
for
of
the
rivers
which
heaped
up
the
soil
in
those
regions
none
is
worthy
to
be
compared
in
volume
with
a
single
one
of
the
mouths
of
the
nile
which
has
five
mouths
moreover
there
are
other
rivers
also
not
in
size
at
all
equal
to
the
nile
which
have
performed
great
feats
of
which
i
can
mention
the
names
of
several
and
especially
the
acheloös
which
flowing
through
acarnania
and
so
issuing
out
into
the
sea
has
already
made
half
of
the
echinades
from
islands
into
mainland
now
there
is
in
the
land
of
arabia
not
far
from
egypt
a
gulf
of
the
sea
running
in
from
that
which
is
called
the
erythraian
sea
very
long
and
narrow
as
i
am
about
to
tell
with
respect
to
the
length
of
the
voyage
along
it
one
who
set
out
from
the
innermost
point
to
sail
out
through
it
into
the
open
sea
would
spend
forty
days
upon
the
voyage
using
oars
and
with
respect
to
breadth
where
the
gulf
is
broadest
it
is
half
a
day
sail
across
and
there
is
in
it
an
ebb
and
flow
of
tide
every
day
just
such
another
gulf
i
suppose
that
egypt
was
and
that
the
one
ran
in
towards
ethiopia
from
the
northern
sea
and
the
other
the
arabian
of
which
i
am
about
to
speak
tended
from
the
south
towards
syria
the
gulfs
boring
in
so
as
almost
to
meet
at
their
extreme
points
and
passing
by
one
another
with
but
a
small
space
left
between
if
then
the
stream
of
the
nile
should
turn
aside
into
this
arabian
gulf
what
would
hinder
that
gulf
from
being
filled
up
with
silt
as
the
river
continued
to
flow
at
all
events
within
a
period
of
twenty
thousand
years
indeed
for
my
part
i
am
of
opinion
that
it
would
be
filled
up
even
within
ten
thousand
years
how
then
in
all
the
time
that
has
elapsed
before
i
came
into
being
should
not
a
gulf
be
filled
up
even
of
much
greater
size
than
this
by
a
river
so
great
and
so
active
as
regards
egypt
then
i
both
believe
those
who
say
that
things
are
so
and
for
myself
also
i
am
strongly
of
opinion
that
they
are
so
because
i
have
observed
that
egypt
runs
out
into
the
sea
further
than
the
adjoining
land
and
that
shells
are
found
upon
the
mountains
of
it
and
an
efflorescence
of
salt
forms
upon
the
surface
so
that
even
the
pyramids
are
being
eaten
away
by
it
and
moreover
that
of
all
the
mountains
of
egypt
the
range
which
lies
above
memphis
is
the
only
one
which
has
sand
besides
which
i
notice
that
egypt
resembles
neither
the
land
of
arabia
which
borders
upon
it
nor
libya
nor
yet
syria
for
they
are
syrians
who
dwell
in
the
parts
of
arabia
lying
along
the
sea
but
that
it
has
soil
which
is
black
and
easily
breaks
up
seeing
that
it
is
in
truth
mud
and
silt
brought
down
from
ethiopia
by
the
river
but
the
soil
of
libya
we
know
is
reddish
in
colour
and
rather
sandy
while
that
of
arabia
and
syria
is
somewhat
clayey
and
rocky
the
priests
also
gave
me
a
strong
proof
concerning
this
land
as
follows
namely
that
in
the
reign
of
king
moiris
whenever
the
river
reached
a
height
of
at
least
eight
cubits
it
watered
egypt
below
memphis
and
not
yet
nine
hundred
years
had
gone
by
since
the
death
of
moiris
when
i
heard
these
things
from
the
priests
now
however
unless
the
river
rises
to
sixteen
cubits
or
fifteen
at
the
least
it
does
not
go
over
the
land
i
think
too
that
those
egyptians
who
dwell
below
the
lake
of
moiris
and
especially
in
that
region
which
is
called
the
delta
if
that
land
continues
to
grow
in
height
according
to
this
proportion
and
to
increase
similarly
in
extent
will
suffer
for
all
remaining
time
from
the
nile
not
overflowing
their
land
that
same
thing
which
they
themselves
said
that
the
hellenes
would
at
some
time
suffer
for
hearing
that
the
whole
land
of
the
hellenes
has
rain
and
is
not
watered
by
rivers
as
theirs
is
they
said
that
the
hellenes
would
at
some
time
be
disappointed
of
a
great
hope
and
would
suffer
the
ills
of
famine
this
saying
means
that
if
the
god
shall
not
send
them
rain
but
shall
allow
drought
to
prevail
for
a
long
time
the
hellenes
will
be
destroyed
by
hunger
for
they
have
in
fact
no
other
supply
of
water
to
save
them
except
from
zeus
alone
this
has
been
rightly
said
by
the
egyptians
with
reference
to
the
hellenes
but
now
let
me
tell
how
matters
are
with
the
egyptians
themselves
in
their
turn
if
in
accordance
with
what
i
before
said
their
land
below
memphis
for
this
is
that
which
is
increasing
shall
continue
to
increase
in
height
according
to
the
same
proportion
as
in
past
time
assuredly
those
egyptians
who
dwell
here
will
suffer
famine
if
their
land
shall
not
have
rain
nor
the
river
be
able
to
go
over
their
fields
it
is
certain
however
that
now
they
gather
in
fruit
from
the
earth
with
less
labour
than
any
other
men
and
also
with
less
than
the
other
egyptians
for
they
have
no
labour
in
breaking
up
furrows
with
a
plough
nor
in
hoeing
nor
in
any
other
of
those
labours
which
other
men
have
about
a
crop
but
when
the
river
has
come
up
of
itself
and
watered
their
fields
and
after
watering
has
left
them
again
then
each
man
sows
his
own
field
and
turns
into
it
swine
and
when
he
has
trodden
the
seed
into
the
ground
by
means
of
the
swine
after
that
he
waits
for
the
harvest
and
when
he
has
threshed
the
corn
by
means
of
the
swine
then
he
gathers
it
in
if
we
desire
to
follow
the
opinions
of
the
ionians
as
regards
egypt
who
say
that
the
delta
alone
is
egypt
reckoning
its
to
be
from
the
called
of
perseus
to
the
houses
of
pelusion
a
distance
of
forty
schoines
and
counting
it
to
extend
inland
as
far
as
the
city
of
kercasoros
where
the
nile
divides
and
runs
to
pelusion
and
canobos
while
as
for
the
rest
of
egypt
they
assign
it
partly
to
libya
and
partly
to
arabia
i
say
we
should
follow
this
account
we
should
thereby
declare
that
in
former
times
the
egyptians
had
no
land
to
live
in
for
as
we
have
seen
their
delta
at
any
rate
is
alluvial
and
has
appeared
so
to
speak
lately
as
the
egyptians
themselves
say
and
as
my
opinion
is
if
then
at
the
first
there
was
no
land
for
them
to
live
in
why
did
they
waste
their
labour
to
prove
that
they
had
come
into
being
before
all
other
men
they
needed
not
to
have
made
trial
of
the
children
to
see
what
language
they
would
first
utter
however
i
am
not
of
opinion
that
the
egyptians
came
into
being
at
the
same
time
as
that
which
is
called
by
the
ionians
the
delta
but
that
they
existed
always
ever
since
the
human
race
came
into
being
and
that
as
their
land
advanced
forwards
many
of
them
were
left
in
their
first
abodes
and
many
came
down
gradually
to
the
lower
parts
at
least
it
is
certain
that
in
old
times
thebes
had
the
name
of
egypt
and
of
this
the
circumference
measures
six
thousand
one
hundred
and
twenty
furlongs
if
then
we
judge
aright
of
these
matters
the
opinion
of
the
ionians
about
egypt
is
not
sound
but
if
the
judgment
of
the
ionians
is
right
i
declare
that
neither
the
hellenes
nor
the
ionians
themselves
know
how
to
reckon
since
they
say
that
the
whole
earth
is
made
up
of
three
divisions
europe
asia
and
libya
for
they
ought
to
count
in
addition
to
these
the
delta
of
egypt
since
it
belongs
neither
to
asia
nor
to
libya
for
at
least
it
can
not
be
the
river
nile
by
this
reckoning
which
divides
asia
from
libya
but
the
nile
is
cleft
at
the
point
of
this
delta
so
as
to
flow
round
it
and
the
result
is
that
this
land
would
come
between
asia
and
libya
we
dismiss
then
the
opinion
of
the
ionians
and
express
a
judgment
of
our
own
in
this
matter
also
that
egypt
is
all
that
land
which
is
inhabited
by
egyptians
just
as
kilikia
is
that
which
is
inhabited
by
kilikians
and
assyria
that
which
is
inhabited
by
assyrians
and
we
know
of
no
boundary
properly
speaking
between
asia
and
libya
except
the
borders
of
egypt
if
however
we
shall
adopt
the
opinion
which
is
commonly
held
by
the
hellenes
we
shall
suppose
that
the
whole
of
egypt
beginning
from
the
cataract
and
the
city
of
elephantine
is
divided
into
two
parts
and
that
it
thus
partakes
of
both
the
names
since
one
side
will
thus
belong
to
libya
and
the
other
to
asia
for
the
nile
from
the
cataract
onwards
flows
to
the
sea
cutting
egypt
through
the
midst
and
as
far
as
the
city
of
kercasoros
the
nile
flows
in
one
single
stream
but
from
this
city
onwards
it
is
parted
into
three
ways
and
one
which
is
called
the
pelusian
mouth
turns
towards
the
east
the
second
of
the
ways
goes
towards
the
west
and
this
is
called
the
canobic
mouth
but
that
one
of
the
ways
which
is
straight
runs
thus
the
river
in
its
course
downwards
comes
to
the
point
of
the
delta
then
it
cuts
the
delta
through
the
midst
and
so
issues
out
to
the
sea
in
this
we
have
a
portion
of
the
water
of
the
river
which
is
not
the
smallest
nor
the
least
famous
and
it
is
called
the
sebennytic
mouth
there
are
also
two
other
mouths
which
part
off
from
the
sebennytic
and
go
to
the
sea
and
these
are
called
one
the
saïtic
the
other
the
mendesian
mouth
the
bolbitinitic
and
bucolic
mouths
on
the
other
hand
are
not
natural
but
made
by
digging
moreover
also
the
answer
given
by
the
oracle
of
ammon
bears
witness
in
support
of
my
opinion
that
egypt
is
of
the
extent
which
i
declare
it
to
be
in
my
account
and
of
this
answer
i
heard
after
i
had
formed
my
own
opinion
about
egypt
for
those
of
the
city
of
marea
and
of
apis
dwelling
in
the
parts
of
egypt
which
border
on
libya
being
of
opinion
themselves
that
they
were
libyans
and
not
egyptians
and
also
being
burdened
by
the
rules
of
religious
service
because
they
desired
not
to
be
debarred
from
the
use
of
cows
flesh
sent
to
ammon
saying
that
they
had
nought
in
common
with
the
egyptians
for
they
dwelt
outside
the
delta
and
agreed
with
them
in
nothing
and
they
said
they
desired
that
it
might
be
lawful
for
them
to
eat
everything
without
distinction
the
god
however
did
not
permit
them
to
do
so
but
said
that
that
land
which
was
egypt
which
the
nile
came
over
and
watered
and
that
those
were
egyptians
who
dwelling
below
the
city
of
elephantine
drank
of
that
river
thus
it
was
answered
to
them
by
the
oracle
about
this
and
the
nile
when
it
is
in
flood
goes
over
not
only
the
delta
but
also
of
the
land
which
is
called
libyan
and
of
that
which
is
called
arabian
sometimes
as
much
as
two
days
journey
on
each
side
and
at
times
even
more
than
this
or
at
times
less
as
regards
the
nature
of
the
river
neither
from
the
priests
nor
yet
from
any
other
man
was
i
able
to
obtain
any
knowledge
and
i
was
desirous
especially
to
learn
from
them
about
these
matters
namely
why
the
nile
comes
down
increasing
in
volume
from
the
summer
solstice
onwards
for
a
hundred
days
and
then
when
it
has
reached
the
number
of
these
days
turns
and
goes
back
failing
in
its
stream
so
that
through
the
whole
winter
season
it
continues
to
be
low
and
until
the
summer
solstice
returns
of
none
of
these
things
was
i
able
to
receive
any
account
from
the
egyptians
when
i
inquired
of
them
what
power
the
nile
has
whereby
it
is
of
a
nature
opposite
to
that
of
other
rivers
and
i
made
inquiry
desiring
to
know
both
this
which
i
say
and
also
why
unlike
all
other
rivers
it
does
not
give
rise
to
any
breezes
blowing
from
it
however
some
of
the
hellenes
who
desired
to
gain
distinction
for
cleverness
have
given
an
account
of
this
water
in
three
different
ways
two
of
these
i
do
not
think
it
worth
while
even
to
speak
of
except
only
to
indicate
their
nature
of
which
the
one
says
that
the
etesian
winds
are
the
cause
that
makes
the
river
rise
by
preventing
the
nile
from
flowing
out
into
the
sea
but
often
the
etesian
winds
fail
and
yet
the
nile
does
the
same
work
as
it
is
wont
to
do
and
moreover
if
these
were
the
cause
all
the
other
rivers
also
which
flow
in
a
direction
opposed
to
the
etesian
winds
ought
to
have
been
affected
in
the
same
way
as
the
nile
and
even
more
in
as
much
as
they
are
smaller
and
present
to
them
a
feebler
flow
of
stream
but
there
are
many
of
these
rivers
in
syria
and
many
also
in
libya
and
they
are
affected
in
no
such
manner
as
the
nile
the
second
way
shows
more
ignorance
than
that
which
has
been
mentioned
and
it
is
more
marvellous
to
tell
for
it
says
that
the
river
produces
these
effects
because
it
flows
from
the
ocean
and
that
the
ocean
flows
round
the
whole
earth
the
third
of
the
ways
is
much
the
most
specious
but
nevertheless
it
is
the
most
mistaken
of
all
for
indeed
this
way
has
no
more
truth
in
it
than
the
rest
alleging
as
it
does
that
the
nile
flows
from
melting
snow
whereas
it
flows
out
of
libya
through
the
midst
of
the
ethiopians
and
so
comes
out
into
egypt
how
then
should
it
flow
from
snow
when
it
flows
from
the
hottest
parts
to
those
which
are
cooler
and
indeed
most
of
the
facts
are
such
as
to
convince
a
man
one
at
least
who
is
capable
of
reasoning
about
such
matters
that
it
is
not
at
all
likely
that
it
flows
from
snow
the
first
and
greatest
evidence
is
afforded
by
the
winds
which
blow
hot
from
these
regions
the
second
is
that
the
land
is
rainless
always
and
without
frost
whereas
after
snow
has
fallen
rain
must
necessarily
come
within
five
days
so
that
if
it
snowed
in
those
parts
rain
would
fall
there
the
third
evidence
is
afforded
by
the
people
dwelling
there
who
are
of
a
black
colour
by
reason
of
the
burning
heat
moreover
kites
and
swallows
remain
there
through
the
year
and
do
not
leave
the
land
and
cranes
flying
from
the
cold
weather
which
comes
on
in
the
region
of
scythia
come
regularly
to
these
parts
for
wintering
if
then
it
snowed
ever
so
little
in
that
land
through
which
the
nile
flows
and
in
which
it
has
its
rise
none
of
these
things
would
take
place
as
necessity
compels
us
to
admit
as
for
him
who
talked
about
the
ocean
he
carried
his
tale
into
the
region
of
the
unknown
and
so
he
need
not
be
refuted
since
i
for
my
part
know
of
no
river
ocean
existing
but
i
think
that
homer
or
one
of
the
poets
who
were
before
him
invented
the
name
and
introduced
it
into
his
verse
if
however
after
i
have
found
fault
with
the
opinions
proposed
i
am
bound
to
declare
an
opinion
of
my
own
about
the
matters
which
are
in
doubt
i
will
tell
what
to
my
mind
is
the
reason
why
the
nile
increases
in
the
summer
in
the
winter
season
the
sun
being
driven
away
from
his
former
path
through
the
heaven
by
the
stormy
winds
comes
to
the
upper
parts
of
libya
if
one
would
set
forth
the
matter
in
the
shortest
way
all
has
now
been
said
for
whatever
region
this
god
approaches
most
and
stands
directly
above
this
it
may
reasonably
be
supposed
is
most
in
want
of
water
and
its
native
streams
of
rivers
are
dried
up
most
however
to
set
it
forth
at
greater
length
thus
it
is
sun
passing
in
his
course
by
the
upper
parts
of
libya
does
thus
that
is
to
say
since
at
all
times
the
air
in
those
parts
is
clear
and
the
country
is
warm
because
there
are
no
cold
winds
in
passing
through
it
the
sun
does
just
as
he
was
wont
to
do
in
the
summer
when
going
through
the
midst
of
the
heaven
that
is
he
draws
to
himself
the
water
and
having
drawn
it
he
drives
it
away
to
the
upper
parts
of
the
country
and
the
winds
take
it
up
and
scattering
it
abroad
melt
it
into
rain
so
it
is
natural
that
the
winds
which
blow
from
this
region
namely
the
south
and
winds
should
be
much
the
most
rainy
of
all
the
winds
i
think
however
that
the
sun
does
not
send
away
from
himself
all
the
water
of
the
nile
of
each
year
but
that
he
also
lets
some
remain
behind
with
himself
then
when
the
winter
becomes
milder
the
sun
returns
back
again
to
the
midst
of
the
heaven
and
from
that
time
onwards
he
draws
equally
from
all
rivers
but
in
the
meanwhile
they
flow
in
large
volume
since
water
of
rain
mingles
with
them
in
great
quantity
because
their
country
receives
rain
then
and
is
filled
with
torrent
streams
in
summer
however
they
are
weak
since
not
only
the
showers
of
rain
fail
then
but
also
they
are
drawn
by
the
sun
the
nile
however
alone
of
all
rivers
not
having
rain
and
being
drawn
by
the
sun
naturally
flows
during
this
time
of
winter
in
much
less
than
its
proper
volume
that
is
much
less
than
in
summer
for
then
it
is
drawn
equally
with
all
the
other
waters
but
in
winter
it
bears
the
burden
alone
thus
i
suppose
the
sun
to
be
the
cause
of
these
things
he
is
also
the
cause
in
my
opinion
that
the
air
in
these
parts
is
dry
since
he
makes
it
so
by
scorching
up
his
path
through
the
heaven
thus
summer
prevails
always
in
the
upper
parts
of
libya
if
however
the
station
of
the
seasons
had
been
changed
and
where
now
in
the
heaven
are
placed
the
north
wind
and
winter
there
was
the
station
of
the
south
wind
and
of
the
midday
and
where
now
is
placed
the
south
wind
there
was
the
north
if
this
had
been
so
the
sun
being
driven
from
the
midst
of
the
heaven
by
the
winter
and
the
north
wind
would
go
to
the
upper
parts
of
europe
just
as
now
he
comes
to
the
upper
parts
of
libya
and
passing
in
his
course
throughout
the
whole
of
europe
i
suppose
that
he
would
do
to
the
ister
that
which
he
now
works
upon
the
nile
as
to
the
breeze
why
none
blows
from
the
river
my
opinion
is
that
from
very
hot
places
it
is
not
natural
that
anything
should
blow
and
that
a
breeze
is
wont
to
blow
from
something
cold
let
these
matters
then
be
as
they
are
and
as
they
were
at
the
first
but
as
to
the
sources
of
the
nile
not
one
either
of
the
egyptians
or
of
the
libyans
or
of
the
hellenes
who
came
to
speech
with
me
professed
to
know
anything
except
the
scribe
of
the
sacred
treasury
of
athene
at
the
city
of
saïs
in
egypt
to
me
however
this
man
seemed
not
to
be
speaking
seriously
when
he
said
that
he
had
certain
knowledge
of
it
and
he
said
as
follows
namely
that
there
were
two
mountains
of
which
the
tops
ran
up
to
a
sharp
point
situated
between
the
city
of
syene
which
is
in
the
district
of
thebes
and
elephantine
and
the
names
of
the
mountains
were
of
the
one
crophi
and
of
the
other
mophi
from
the
middle
between
these
two
mountains
flowed
he
said
the
sources
of
the
nile
which
were
fathomless
in
depth
and
half
of
the
water
flowed
to
egypt
and
towards
the
north
wind
the
other
half
to
ethiopia
and
the
south
wind
as
for
the
fathomless
depth
of
the
source
he
said
that
psammetichos
king
of
egypt
came
to
a
trial
of
this
matter
for
he
had
a
rope
twisted
of
many
thousands
of
fathoms
and
let
it
down
in
this
place
and
it
found
no
bottom
by
this
the
scribe
if
this
which
he
told
me
was
really
as
he
said
gave
me
to
understand
that
there
were
certain
strong
eddies
there
and
a
backward
flow
and
that
since
the
water
dashed
against
the
mountains
therefore
the
could
not
come
to
any
bottom
when
it
was
let
down
from
no
other
person
was
i
able
to
learn
anything
about
this
matter
but
for
the
rest
i
learnt
so
much
as
here
follows
by
the
most
diligent
inquiry
for
i
went
myself
as
an
as
far
as
the
city
of
elephantine
and
from
that
point
onwards
i
gathered
knowledge
by
report
from
the
city
of
elephantine
as
one
goes
up
the
river
there
is
country
which
slopes
steeply
so
that
here
one
must
attach
ropes
to
the
vessel
on
both
sides
as
one
fastens
an
ox
and
so
make
one
way
onward
and
if
the
rope
break
the
vessel
is
gone
at
once
carried
away
by
the
violence
of
the
stream
through
this
country
it
is
a
voyage
of
about
four
days
in
length
and
in
this
part
the
nile
is
winding
like
the
river
maiander
and
the
distance
amounts
to
twelve
schoines
which
one
must
traverse
in
this
manner
then
you
will
come
to
a
level
plain
in
which
the
nile
flows
round
an
island
named
tachompso
now
in
the
regions
above
elephantine
there
dwell
ethiopians
at
once
succeeding
who
also
occupy
half
of
the
island
and
egyptians
the
other
half
adjoining
this
island
there
is
a
great
lake
round
which
dwell
ethiopian
nomad
tribes
and
when
you
have
sailed
through
this
you
will
come
to
the
stream
of
the
nile
again
which
flows
into
this
lake
after
this
you
will
disembark
and
make
a
journey
by
land
of
forty
days
for
in
the
nile
sharp
rocks
stand
forth
out
of
the
water
and
there
are
many
reefs
by
which
it
is
not
possible
for
a
vessel
to
pass
then
after
having
passed
through
this
country
in
the
forty
days
which
i
have
said
you
will
embark
again
in
another
vessel
and
sail
for
twelve
days
and
after
this
you
will
come
to
a
great
city
called
meroe
this
city
is
said
to
be
the
of
all
the
other
ethiopians
and
they
who
dwell
in
it
reverence
of
the
gods
zeus
and
dionysos
alone
and
these
they
greatly
honour
and
they
have
an
oracle
of
zeus
established
and
make
warlike
marches
whensoever
this
god
commands
them
by
prophesyings
and
to
whatsoever
place
he
commands
sailing
from
this
city
you
will
come
to
the
deserters
in
another
period
of
time
equal
to
that
in
which
you
came
from
elephantine
to
the
of
the
ethiopians
now
the
name
of
these
deserters
is
asmach
and
this
word
signifies
when
translated
into
the
tongue
of
the
hellenes
those
who
stand
on
the
left
hand
of
the
king
these
were
two
hundred
and
forty
thousand
egyptians
of
the
warrior
class
who
revolted
and
went
over
to
the
ethiopians
for
the
following
cause
the
reign
of
psammetichos
garrisons
were
set
one
towards
the
ethiopians
at
the
city
of
elephantine
another
towards
the
arabians
and
assyrians
at
daphnai
of
pelusion
and
another
towards
libya
at
marea
and
even
in
my
own
time
the
garrisons
of
the
persians
too
are
ordered
in
the
same
manner
as
these
were
in
the
reign
of
psammetichos
for
both
at
elephantine
and
at
daphnai
the
persians
have
outposts
the
egyptians
then
of
whom
i
speak
had
served
as
outposts
for
three
years
and
no
one
relieved
them
from
their
guard
accordingly
they
took
counsel
together
and
adopting
a
common
plan
they
all
in
a
body
revolted
from
psammetichos
and
set
out
for
ethiopia
hearing
this
psammetichos
set
forth
in
pursuit
and
when
he
came
up
with
them
he
entreated
them
much
and
endeavoured
to
persuade
them
not
to
desert
the
gods
of
their
country
and
their
children
and
wives
upon
which
it
is
said
that
one
of
them
pointed
to
his
privy
member
and
said
that
wherever
this
was
there
would
they
have
both
children
and
wives
when
these
came
to
ethiopia
they
gave
themselves
over
to
the
king
of
the
ethiopians
and
he
rewarded
them
as
follows
were
certain
of
the
ethiopians
who
had
come
to
be
at
variance
with
him
and
he
bade
them
drive
these
out
and
dwell
in
their
land
so
since
these
men
settled
in
the
land
of
the
ethiopians
the
ethiopians
have
come
to
be
of
milder
manners
from
having
learnt
the
customs
of
the
egyptians
the
nile
then
besides
that
part
of
its
course
which
is
in
egypt
is
known
as
far
as
a
four
months
journey
by
river
and
land
for
that
is
the
number
of
months
which
are
found
by
reckoning
to
be
spent
in
going
from
elephantine
to
these
deserters
and
the
river
runs
from
the
west
and
the
setting
of
the
sun
but
what
comes
after
that
no
one
can
clearly
say
for
this
land
is
desert
by
reason
of
the
burning
heat
thus
much
however
i
heard
from
men
of
kyrene
who
told
me
that
they
had
been
to
the
oracle
of
ammon
and
had
come
to
speech
with
etearchos
king
of
the
ammonians
and
it
happened
that
after
speaking
of
other
matters
they
fell
to
discourse
about
the
nile
and
how
no
one
knew
the
sources
of
it
and
etearchos
said
that
once
there
had
come
to
him
men
of
the
nasamonians
this
is
a
libyan
race
which
dwells
in
the
syrtis
and
also
in
the
land
to
the
east
of
the
syrtis
reaching
to
no
great
distance
and
when
the
nasamonians
came
and
were
asked
by
him
whether
they
were
able
to
tell
him
anything
more
than
he
knew
about
the
desert
parts
of
libya
they
said
that
there
had
been
among
them
certain
sons
of
chief
men
who
were
of
unruly
disposition
and
these
when
they
grew
up
to
be
men
had
devised
various
other
extravagant
things
and
also
they
had
told
off
by
lot
five
of
themselves
to
go
to
see
the
desert
parts
of
libya
and
to
try
whether
they
could
discover
more
than
those
who
had
previously
explored
furthest
for
in
those
parts
of
libya
which
are
by
the
northern
sea
beginning
from
egypt
and
going
as
far
as
the
headland
of
soloeis
which
is
the
extreme
point
of
libya
libyans
and
of
them
many
races
extend
along
the
whole
coast
except
so
much
as
the
hellenes
and
phenicians
hold
but
in
the
upper
parts
which
lie
above
the
and
above
those
people
whose
land
comes
down
to
the
sea
libya
is
full
of
wild
beasts
and
in
the
parts
above
the
land
of
wild
beasts
it
is
full
of
sand
terribly
waterless
and
utterly
desert
these
young
men
then
said
they
being
sent
out
by
their
companions
well
furnished
with
supplies
of
water
and
provisions
went
first
through
the
inhabited
country
and
after
they
had
passed
through
this
they
came
to
the
country
of
wild
beasts
and
after
this
they
passed
through
the
desert
making
their
journey
towards
the
west
wind
and
having
passed
through
a
great
tract
of
sand
in
many
days
they
saw
at
last
trees
growing
in
a
level
place
and
having
come
up
to
them
they
were
beginning
to
pluck
the
fruit
which
was
upon
the
trees
but
as
they
began
to
pluck
it
there
came
upon
them
small
men
of
less
stature
than
men
of
the
common
size
and
these
seized
them
and
carried
them
away
and
neither
could
the
nasamonians
understand
anything
of
their
speech
nor
could
those
who
were
carrying
them
off
understand
anything
of
the
speech
of
the
nasamonians
and
they
led
them
so
it
was
said
through
very
great
swamps
and
after
passing
through
these
they
came
to
a
city
in
which
all
the
men
were
in
size
like
those
who
carried
them
off
and
in
colour
of
skin
black
and
by
the
city
ran
a
great
river
which
ran
from
the
west
towards
the
sunrising
and
in
it
were
seen
crocodiles
of
the
account
given
by
etearchos
the
ammonian
let
so
much
suffice
as
is
here
said
except
that
as
the
men
of
kyrene
told
me
he
alleged
that
the
nasamonians
returned
safe
home
and
that
the
people
to
whom
they
had
come
were
all
wizards
now
this
river
which
ran
by
the
city
etearchos
conjectured
to
be
the
nile
and
moreover
reason
compels
us
to
think
so
for
the
nile
flows
from
libya
and
cuts
libya
through
in
the
midst
and
as
i
conjecture
judging
of
what
is
not
known
by
that
which
is
evident
to
the
view
it
starts
at
a
distance
from
its
mouth
equal
to
that
of
the
ister
for
the
river
ister
begins
from
the
keltoi
and
the
city
of
pyrene
and
so
runs
that
it
divides
europe
in
the
midst
now
the
keltoi
are
outside
the
pillars
of
heracles
and
border
upon
the
kynesians
who
dwell
furthest
towards
the
sunset
of
all
those
who
have
their
dwelling
in
europe
and
the
ister
ends
having
its
course
through
the
whole
of
europe
by
flowing
into
the
euxine
sea
at
the
place
where
the
milesians
have
their
settlement
of
istria
now
the
ister
since
it
flows
through
land
which
is
inhabited
is
known
by
the
reports
of
many
but
of
the
sources
of
the
nile
no
one
can
give
an
account
for
the
part
of
libya
through
which
it
flows
is
uninhabited
and
desert
about
its
course
however
so
much
as
it
was
possible
to
learn
by
the
most
diligent
inquiry
has
been
told
and
it
runs
out
into
egypt
now
egypt
lies
nearly
opposite
to
the
mountain
districts
of
kilikia
and
from
thence
to
sinope
which
lies
upon
the
euxine
sea
is
a
journey
in
the
same
straight
line
of
five
days
for
a
man
without
encumbrance
and
sinope
lies
opposite
to
the
place
where
the
ister
runs
out
into
the
sea
thus
i
think
that
the
nile
passes
through
the
whole
of
libya
and
is
of
equal
measure
with
the
ister
of
the
nile
then
let
so
much
suffice
as
has
been
said
of
egypt
however
i
shall
make
my
report
at
length
because
it
has
wonders
more
in
number
than
any
other
land
and
works
too
it
has
to
show
as
much
as
any
land
which
are
beyond
expression
great
for
this
reason
then
more
shall
be
said
concerning
it
the
egyptians
in
agreement
with
their
climate
which
is
unlike
any
other
and
with
the
river
which
shows
a
nature
different
from
all
other
rivers
established
for
themselves
manners
and
customs
in
a
way
opposite
to
other
men
in
almost
all
matters
for
among
them
the
women
frequent
the
market
and
carry
on
trade
while
the
men
remain
at
home
and
weave
and
whereas
others
weave
pushing
the
woof
upwards
the
egyptians
push
it
downwards
the
men
carry
their
burdens
upon
their
heads
and
the
women
upon
their
shoulders
the
women
make
water
standing
up
and
the
men
crouching
down
they
ease
themselves
in
their
houses
and
they
eat
without
in
the
streets
alleging
as
reason
for
this
that
it
is
right
to
do
secretly
the
things
that
are
unseemly
though
necessary
but
those
which
are
not
unseemly
in
public
no
woman
is
a
minister
either
of
male
or
female
divinity
but
men
of
all
both
male
and
female
to
support
their
parents
the
sons
are
in
no
way
compelled
if
they
do
not
desire
to
do
so
but
the
daughters
are
forced
to
do
so
be
they
never
so
unwilling
the
priests
of
the
gods
in
other
lands
wear
long
hair
but
in
egypt
they
shave
their
heads
among
other
men
the
custom
is
that
in
mourning
those
whom
the
matter
concerns
most
nearly
have
their
hair
cut
short
but
the
egyptians
when
deaths
occur
let
their
hair
grow
long
both
that
on
the
head
and
that
on
the
chin
having
before
been
close
shaven
other
men
have
their
daily
living
separated
from
beasts
but
the
egyptians
have
theirs
together
with
beasts
other
men
live
on
wheat
and
barley
but
to
any
one
of
the
egyptians
who
makes
his
living
on
these
it
is
a
great
reproach
they
make
their
bread
of
maize
which
some
call
spelt
they
knead
dough
with
their
feet
and
clay
with
their
hands
with
which
also
they
gather
up
dung
and
whereas
other
men
except
such
as
have
learnt
otherwise
from
the
egyptians
have
their
members
as
nature
made
them
the
egyptians
practise
circumcision
as
to
garments
the
men
wear
two
each
and
the
women
but
one
and
whereas
others
make
fast
the
rings
and
ropes
of
the
sails
outside
the
ship
the
egyptians
do
this
inside
finally
in
the
writing
of
characters
and
reckoning
with
pebbles
while
the
hellenes
carry
the
hand
from
the
left
to
the
right
the
egyptians
do
this
from
the
right
to
the
left
and
doing
so
they
say
that
they
do
it
themselves
rightwise
and
the
hellenes
leftwise
and
they
use
two
kinds
of
characters
for
writing
of
which
the
one
kind
is
called
sacred
and
the
other
common
they
are
religious
excessively
beyond
all
other
men
and
with
regard
to
this
they
have
customs
as
follows
drink
from
cups
of
bronze
and
rinse
them
out
every
day
and
not
some
only
do
this
but
all
they
wear
garments
of
linen
always
newly
washed
and
this
they
make
a
special
point
of
practice
they
circumcise
themselves
for
the
sake
of
cleanliness
preferring
to
be
clean
rather
than
comely
the
priests
shave
themselves
all
over
their
body
every
other
day
so
that
no
lice
or
any
other
foul
thing
may
come
to
be
upon
them
when
they
minister
to
the
gods
and
the
priests
wear
garments
of
linen
only
and
sandals
of
papyrus
and
any
other
garment
they
may
not
take
nor
other
sandals
these
wash
themselves
in
cold
water
twice
in
the
day
and
twice
again
in
the
night
and
other
religious
services
they
perform
one
may
almost
say
of
infinite
number
they
enjoy
also
good
things
not
a
few
for
they
do
not
consume
or
spend
anything
of
their
own
substance
but
there
is
sacred
bread
baked
for
them
and
they
have
each
great
quantity
of
flesh
of
oxen
and
geese
coming
in
to
them
each
day
and
also
wine
of
grapes
is
given
to
them
but
it
is
not
permitted
to
them
to
taste
of
fish
beans
moreover
the
egyptians
do
not
at
all
sow
in
their
land
and
those
which
grow
they
neither
eat
raw
nor
boil
for
food
nay
the
priests
do
not
endure
even
to
look
upon
them
thinking
this
to
be
an
unclean
kind
of
pulse
and
there
is
not
one
priest
only
for
each
of
the
gods
but
many
and
of
them
one
is
and
whenever
a
priest
dies
his
son
is
appointed
to
his
place
the
males
of
the
ox
kind
they
consider
to
belong
to
epaphos
and
on
account
of
him
they
test
them
in
the
following
manner
the
priest
sees
one
single
black
hair
upon
the
beast
he
counts
it
not
clean
for
sacrifice
and
one
of
the
priests
who
is
appointed
for
the
purpose
makes
investigation
of
these
matters
both
when
the
beast
is
standing
upright
and
when
it
is
lying
on
its
back
drawing
out
its
tongue
moreover
to
see
if
it
is
clean
in
respect
of
the
appointed
signs
which
i
shall
tell
of
in
another
part
of
the
history
he
looks
also
at
the
hairs
of
the
tail
to
see
if
it
has
them
growing
in
the
natural
manner
and
if
it
be
clean
in
respect
of
all
these
things
he
marks
it
with
a
piece
of
papyrus
rolling
this
round
the
horns
and
then
when
he
has
plastered
over
it
he
sets
upon
it
the
seal
of
his
and
after
that
they
take
the
animal
away
but
for
one
who
sacrifices
a
beast
not
sealed
the
penalty
appointed
is
death
in
this
way
then
the
beast
is
tested
and
their
appointed
manner
of
sacrifice
is
as
follows
lead
the
sealed
beast
to
the
altar
where
they
happen
to
be
sacrificing
and
then
kindle
a
fire
after
that
having
poured
libations
of
wine
over
the
altar
so
that
it
runs
down
upon
the
victim
and
having
called
upon
the
god
they
cut
its
throat
and
having
cut
its
throat
they
sever
the
head
from
the
body
the
body
then
of
the
beast
they
flay
but
upon
the
head
they
make
many
imprecations
first
and
then
they
who
have
a
market
and
hellenes
sojourning
among
them
for
trade
these
carry
it
to
the
and
sell
it
while
they
who
have
no
hellenes
among
them
cast
it
away
into
the
river
and
this
is
the
form
of
imprecation
which
they
utter
upon
the
heads
praying
that
if
any
evil
be
about
to
befall
either
themselves
who
are
offering
sacrifice
or
the
land
of
egypt
in
general
it
may
come
rather
upon
this
head
now
as
regards
the
heads
of
the
beasts
which
are
sacrificed
and
the
pouring
over
them
of
the
wine
all
the
egyptians
have
the
same
customs
equally
for
all
their
sacrifices
and
by
reason
of
this
custom
none
of
the
egyptians
eat
of
the
head
either
of
this
or
of
any
other
kind
of
animal
but
the
manner
of
disembowelling
the
victims
and
of
burning
them
is
appointed
among
them
differently
for
different
sacrifices
i
shall
speak
however
of
the
sacrifices
to
that
goddess
whom
they
regard
as
the
greatest
of
all
and
to
whom
they
celebrate
the
greatest
they
have
flayed
the
bullock
and
made
imprecation
they
take
out
the
whole
of
its
lower
entrails
but
leave
in
the
body
the
upper
entrails
and
the
fat
and
they
sever
from
it
the
legs
and
the
end
of
the
loin
and
the
shoulders
and
the
neck
and
this
done
they
fill
the
rest
of
the
body
of
the
animal
with
consecrated
loaves
and
honey
and
raisins
and
figs
and
frankincense
and
myrrh
and
every
other
kind
of
spices
and
having
filled
it
with
these
they
offer
it
pouring
over
it
great
abundance
of
oil
they
make
their
sacrifice
after
fasting
and
while
the
offerings
are
being
burnt
they
all
beat
themselves
for
mourning
and
when
they
have
finished
beating
themselves
they
set
forth
as
a
feast
that
which
they
left
unburnt
of
the
sacrifice
the
clean
males
then
of
the
ox
kind
both
animals
and
calves
are
sacrificed
by
all
the
egyptians
the
females
however
they
may
not
sacrifice
but
these
are
sacred
to
isis
for
the
figure
of
isis
is
in
the
form
of
a
woman
with
cow
horns
just
as
the
hellenes
present
io
in
pictures
and
all
the
egyptians
without
distinction
reverence
cows
far
more
than
any
other
kind
of
cattle
for
which
reason
neither
man
nor
woman
of
egyptian
race
would
kiss
a
man
who
is
a
hellene
on
the
mouth
nor
will
they
use
a
knife
or
or
a
caldron
belonging
to
a
hellene
nor
taste
of
the
flesh
even
of
a
clean
animal
if
it
has
been
cut
with
the
knife
of
a
hellene
and
the
cattle
of
this
kind
which
die
they
bury
in
the
following
manner
females
they
cast
into
the
river
but
the
males
they
bury
each
people
in
the
suburb
of
their
town
with
one
of
the
horns
or
sometimes
both
protruding
to
mark
the
place
and
when
the
bodies
have
rotted
away
and
the
appointed
time
comes
on
then
to
each
city
comes
a
boat
from
that
which
is
called
the
island
of
prosopitis
this
is
in
the
delta
and
the
extent
of
its
circuit
is
nine
schoines
in
this
island
of
prosopitis
is
situated
besides
many
other
cities
that
one
from
which
the
boats
come
to
take
up
the
bones
of
the
oxen
and
the
name
of
the
city
is
atarbechis
and
in
it
there
is
set
up
a
holy
temple
of
aphrodite
from
this
city
many
go
abroad
in
various
directions
some
to
one
city
and
others
to
another
and
when
they
have
dug
up
the
bones
of
the
oxen
they
carry
them
off
and
coming
together
they
bury
them
in
one
single
place
in
the
same
manner
as
they
bury
the
oxen
they
bury
also
their
other
cattle
when
they
die
for
about
them
also
they
have
the
same
law
laid
down
and
these
also
they
abstain
from
killing
now
all
who
have
a
temple
set
up
to
the
theban
zeus
or
who
are
of
the
district
of
thebes
these
i
say
all
sacrifice
goats
and
abstain
from
sheep
for
not
all
the
egyptians
equally
reverence
the
same
gods
except
only
isis
and
osiris
who
they
say
is
dionysos
these
they
all
reverence
alike
but
they
who
have
a
temple
of
mendes
or
belong
to
the
mendesian
district
these
abstain
from
goats
and
sacrifice
sheep
now
the
men
of
thebes
and
those
who
after
their
example
abstain
from
sheep
say
that
this
custom
was
established
among
them
for
the
cause
which
follows
they
say
had
an
earnest
desire
to
see
zeus
and
zeus
did
not
desire
to
be
seen
of
him
and
at
last
when
heracles
was
urgent
in
entreaty
zeus
contrived
this
device
that
is
to
say
he
flayed
a
ram
and
held
in
front
of
him
the
head
of
the
ram
which
he
had
cut
off
and
he
put
on
over
him
the
fleece
and
then
showed
himself
to
him
hence
the
egyptians
make
the
image
of
zeus
into
the
face
of
a
ram
and
the
ammonians
do
so
also
after
their
example
being
settlers
both
from
the
egyptians
and
from
the
ethiopians
and
using
a
language
which
is
a
medley
of
both
tongues
and
in
my
opinion
it
is
from
this
god
that
the
ammonians
took
the
name
which
they
have
for
the
egyptians
call
zeus
amun
the
thebans
then
do
not
sacrifice
rams
but
hold
them
sacred
for
this
reason
on
one
day
however
in
the
year
on
the
feast
of
zeus
they
cut
up
in
the
same
manner
and
flay
one
single
ram
and
cover
with
its
skin
the
image
of
zeus
and
then
they
bring
up
to
it
another
image
of
heracles
this
done
all
who
are
in
the
temple
beat
themselves
in
lamentation
for
the
ram
and
then
they
bury
it
in
a
sacred
tomb
about
heracles
i
heard
the
account
given
that
he
was
of
the
number
of
the
twelve
gods
but
of
the
other
heracles
whom
the
hellenes
know
i
was
not
able
to
hear
in
any
part
of
egypt
and
moreover
to
prove
that
the
egyptians
did
not
take
the
name
of
heracles
from
the
hellenes
but
rather
the
hellenes
from
the
egyptians
is
to
say
those
of
the
hellenes
who
gave
the
name
heracles
to
the
son
of
amphitryon
that
i
say
besides
many
other
evidences
there
is
chiefly
this
namely
that
the
parents
of
this
heracles
amphitryon
and
alcmene
were
both
of
egypt
by
descent
and
also
that
the
egyptians
say
that
they
do
not
know
the
names
either
of
poseidon
or
of
the
dioscuroi
nor
have
these
been
accepted
by
them
as
gods
among
the
other
gods
whereas
if
they
had
received
from
the
hellenes
the
name
of
any
divinity
they
would
naturally
have
preserved
the
memory
of
these
most
of
all
assuming
that
in
those
times
as
now
some
of
the
hellenes
were
wont
to
make
voyages
and
were
folk
as
i
suppose
and
as
my
judgment
compels
me
to
think
so
that
the
egyptians
would
have
learnt
the
names
of
these
gods
even
more
than
that
of
heracles
in
fact
however
heracles
is
a
very
ancient
egyptian
god
and
as
they
say
themselves
it
is
seventeen
thousand
years
to
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
amasis
from
the
time
when
the
twelve
gods
of
whom
they
count
that
heracles
is
one
were
begotten
of
the
eight
gods
i
moreover
desiring
to
know
something
certain
of
these
matters
so
far
as
might
be
made
a
voyage
also
to
tyre
of
phenicia
hearing
that
in
that
place
there
was
a
holy
temple
of
heracles
and
i
saw
that
it
was
richly
furnished
with
many
votive
offerings
besides
and
especially
there
were
in
it
two
pillars
the
one
of
pure
gold
and
the
other
of
an
emerald
stone
of
such
size
as
to
shine
by
night
and
having
come
to
speech
with
the
priests
of
the
god
i
asked
them
how
long
time
it
was
since
their
temple
had
been
set
up
and
these
also
i
found
to
be
at
variance
with
the
hellenes
for
they
said
that
at
the
same
time
when
tyre
was
founded
the
temple
of
the
god
also
had
been
set
up
and
that
it
was
a
period
of
two
thousand
three
hundred
years
since
their
people
began
to
dwell
at
tyre
i
saw
also
at
tyre
another
temple
of
heracles
with
the
surname
thasian
and
i
came
to
thasos
also
and
there
i
found
a
temple
of
heracles
set
up
by
the
phenicians
who
had
sailed
out
to
seek
for
europa
and
had
colonised
thasos
and
these
things
happened
full
five
generations
of
men
before
heracles
the
son
of
amphitryon
was
born
in
hellas
so
then
my
inquiries
show
clearly
that
heracles
is
an
ancient
god
and
those
of
the
hellenes
seem
to
me
to
act
most
rightly
who
have
two
temples
of
heracles
set
up
and
who
sacrifice
to
the
one
as
an
immortal
god
and
with
the
title
olympian
and
make
offerings
of
the
dead
to
the
other
as
a
hero
moreover
besides
many
other
stories
which
the
hellenes
tell
without
due
consideration
this
tale
is
especially
foolish
which
they
tell
about
heracles
namely
that
when
he
came
to
egypt
the
egyptians
put
on
him
wreaths
and
led
him
forth
in
procession
to
sacrifice
him
to
zeus
and
he
for
some
time
kept
quiet
but
when
they
were
beginning
the
sacrifice
of
him
at
the
altar
he
betook
himself
to
prowess
and
slew
them
all
i
for
my
part
am
of
opinion
that
the
hellenes
when
they
tell
this
tale
are
altogether
without
knowledge
of
the
nature
and
customs
of
the
egyptians
for
how
should
they
for
whom
it
is
not
lawful
to
sacrifice
even
beasts
except
swine
and
the
males
of
oxen
and
calves
such
of
them
as
are
clean
and
geese
how
should
these
sacrifice
human
beings
besides
this
how
is
it
in
nature
possible
that
heracles
being
one
person
only
and
moreover
a
man
as
they
assert
should
slay
many
myriads
having
said
so
much
of
these
matters
we
pray
that
we
may
have
grace
from
both
the
gods
and
the
heroes
for
our
speech
now
the
reason
why
those
of
the
egyptians
whom
i
have
mentioned
do
not
sacrifice
goats
female
or
male
is
this
mendesians
count
pan
to
be
one
of
the
eight
gods
now
these
eight
gods
they
say
came
into
being
before
the
twelve
gods
and
the
painters
and
represent
in
painting
and
in
sculpture
the
figure
of
pan
just
as
the
hellenes
do
with
goat
face
and
legs
not
supposing
him
to
be
really
like
this
but
to
resemble
the
other
gods
the
cause
however
why
they
represent
him
in
this
form
i
prefer
not
to
say
the
mendesians
then
reverence
all
goats
and
the
males
more
than
the
females
and
the
goatherds
too
have
greater
honour
than
other
herdsmen
but
of
the
goats
one
especially
is
reverenced
and
when
he
dies
there
is
great
mourning
in
all
the
mendesian
district
and
both
the
goat
and
pan
are
called
in
the
egyptian
tongue
mendes
moreover
in
my
lifetime
there
happened
in
that
district
this
marvel
that
is
to
say
a
had
intercourse
with
a
woman
publicly
and
this
was
so
done
that
all
men
might
have
evidence
of
it
the
pig
is
accounted
by
the
egyptians
an
abominable
animal
and
first
if
any
of
them
in
passing
by
touch
a
pig
he
goes
into
the
river
and
dips
himself
forthwith
in
the
water
together
with
his
garments
and
then
too
swineherds
though
they
be
native
egyptians
unlike
all
others
do
not
enter
any
of
the
temples
in
egypt
nor
is
anyone
willing
to
give
his
daughter
in
marriage
to
one
of
them
or
to
take
a
wife
from
among
them
but
the
swineherds
both
give
in
marriage
to
one
another
and
take
from
one
another
now
to
the
other
gods
the
egyptians
do
not
think
it
right
to
sacrifice
swine
but
to
the
moon
and
to
dionysos
alone
at
the
same
time
and
on
the
same
they
sacrifice
swine
and
then
eat
their
flesh
and
as
to
the
reason
why
when
they
abominate
swine
at
all
their
other
feasts
they
sacrifice
them
at
this
there
is
a
story
told
by
the
egyptians
and
this
story
i
know
but
it
is
not
a
seemly
one
for
me
to
tell
now
the
sacrifice
of
the
swine
to
the
moon
is
performed
as
follows
the
priest
has
slain
the
victim
he
puts
together
the
end
of
the
tail
and
the
spleen
and
the
caul
and
covers
them
up
with
the
whole
of
the
fat
of
the
animal
which
is
about
the
paunch
and
then
he
offers
them
with
fire
and
the
rest
of
the
flesh
they
eat
on
that
day
of
full
moon
upon
which
they
have
held
the
sacrifice
but
on
any
day
after
this
they
will
not
taste
of
it
the
poor
however
among
them
by
reason
of
the
scantiness
of
their
means
shape
pigs
of
dough
and
having
baked
them
they
offer
these
as
a
sacrifice
then
for
dionysos
on
the
eve
of
the
festival
each
one
kills
a
pig
by
cutting
its
throat
before
his
own
doors
and
after
that
he
gives
the
pig
to
the
swineherd
who
sold
it
to
him
to
carry
away
again
and
the
rest
of
the
feast
of
dionysos
is
celebrated
by
the
egyptians
in
the
same
way
as
by
the
hellenes
in
almost
all
things
except
choral
dances
but
instead
of
the
phallos
they
have
invented
another
contrivance
namely
figures
of
about
a
cubit
in
height
worked
by
strings
which
women
carry
about
the
villages
with
the
privy
member
made
to
move
and
not
much
less
in
size
than
the
rest
of
the
body
and
a
flute
goes
before
and
they
follow
singing
the
praises
of
dionysos
as
to
the
reason
why
the
figure
has
this
member
larger
than
is
natural
and
moves
it
though
it
moves
no
other
part
of
the
body
about
this
there
is
a
sacred
story
told
now
i
think
that
melampus
the
son
of
amytheon
was
not
without
knowledge
of
these
rites
of
sacrifice
but
was
acquainted
with
them
for
melampus
is
he
who
first
set
forth
to
the
hellenes
the
name
of
dionysos
and
the
manner
of
sacrifice
and
the
procession
of
the
phallos
strictly
speaking
indeed
he
when
he
made
it
known
did
not
take
in
the
whole
but
those
wise
men
who
came
after
him
made
it
known
more
at
large
melampus
then
is
he
who
taught
of
the
phallos
which
is
carried
in
procession
for
dionysos
and
from
him
the
hellenes
learnt
to
do
that
which
they
do
i
say
then
that
melampus
being
a
man
of
ability
contrived
for
himself
an
art
of
divination
and
having
learnt
from
egypt
he
taught
the
hellenes
many
things
and
among
them
those
that
concern
dionysos
making
changes
in
some
few
points
of
them
for
i
shall
not
say
that
that
which
is
done
in
worship
of
the
god
in
egypt
came
accidentally
to
be
the
same
with
that
which
is
done
among
the
hellenes
for
then
these
rites
would
have
been
in
character
with
the
hellenic
worship
and
not
lately
brought
in
nor
certainly
shall
i
say
that
the
egyptians
took
from
the
hellenes
either
this
or
any
other
customary
observance
but
i
think
it
most
probable
that
melampus
learnt
the
matters
concerning
dionysos
from
cadmos
the
tyrian
and
from
those
who
came
with
him
from
phenicia
to
the
land
which
we
now
call
boeotia
moreover
the
naming
of
almost
all
the
gods
has
come
to
hellas
from
egypt
for
that
it
has
come
from
the
barbarians
i
find
by
inquiry
is
true
and
i
am
of
opinion
that
most
probably
it
has
come
from
egypt
because
except
in
the
case
of
poseidon
and
the
dioscuroi
in
accordance
with
that
which
i
have
said
before
and
also
of
hera
and
hestia
and
themis
and
the
charites
and
nereïds
the
egyptians
have
had
the
names
of
all
the
other
gods
in
their
country
for
all
time
what
i
say
here
is
that
which
the
egyptians
think
themselves
but
as
for
the
gods
whose
names
they
profess
that
they
do
not
know
these
i
think
received
their
naming
from
the
pelasgians
except
poseidon
but
about
this
god
the
hellenes
learnt
from
the
libyans
for
no
people
except
the
libyans
have
had
the
name
of
poseidon
from
the
first
and
have
paid
honour
to
this
god
always
nor
it
may
be
added
have
the
egyptians
any
custom
of
worshipping
heroes
these
observances
then
and
others
besides
these
which
i
shall
mention
the
hellenes
have
adopted
from
the
egyptians
but
to
make
as
they
do
the
images
of
hermes
with
the
phallos
they
have
learnt
not
from
the
egyptians
but
from
the
pelasgians
the
custom
having
been
received
by
the
athenians
first
of
all
the
hellenes
and
from
these
by
the
rest
for
just
at
the
time
when
the
athenians
were
beginning
to
rank
among
the
hellenes
the
pelasgians
became
dwellers
with
them
in
their
land
and
from
this
very
cause
it
was
that
they
began
to
be
counted
as
hellenes
whosoever
has
been
initiated
in
the
mysteries
of
the
cabeiroi
which
the
samothrakians
perform
having
received
them
from
the
pelasgians
that
man
knows
the
meaning
of
my
speech
for
these
very
pelasgians
who
became
dwellers
with
the
athenians
used
to
dwell
before
that
time
in
samothrake
and
from
them
the
samothrakians
received
their
mysteries
so
then
the
athenians
were
the
first
of
the
hellenes
who
made
the
images
of
hermes
with
the
phallos
having
learnt
from
the
pelasgians
and
the
pelasgians
told
a
sacred
story
about
it
which
is
set
forth
in
the
mysteries
in
samothrake
now
the
pelasgians
formerly
were
wont
to
make
all
their
sacrifices
calling
upon
the
gods
in
prayer
as
i
know
from
that
which
i
heard
at
dodona
but
they
gave
no
title
or
name
to
any
of
them
for
they
had
not
yet
heard
any
but
they
called
them
gods
theous
from
some
such
notion
as
this
that
they
had
set
thentes
in
order
all
things
and
so
had
the
distribution
of
everything
afterwards
when
much
time
had
elapsed
they
learnt
from
egypt
the
names
of
the
gods
all
except
dionysos
for
his
name
they
learnt
long
afterwards
and
after
a
time
the
pelasgians
consulted
the
oracle
at
dodona
about
the
names
for
this
prophetic
seat
is
accounted
to
be
the
most
ancient
of
the
oracles
which
are
among
the
hellenes
and
at
that
time
it
was
the
only
one
so
when
the
pelasgians
asked
the
oracle
at
dodona
whether
they
should
adopt
the
names
which
had
come
from
the
barbarians
the
oracle
in
reply
bade
them
make
use
of
the
names
from
this
time
they
sacrificed
using
the
names
of
the
gods
and
from
the
pelasgians
the
hellenes
afterwards
received
them
but
whence
the
several
gods
had
their
birth
or
whether
they
all
were
from
the
beginning
and
of
what
form
they
are
they
did
not
learn
till
yesterday
as
it
were
or
the
day
before
for
hesiod
and
homer
i
suppose
were
four
hundred
years
before
my
time
and
not
more
and
these
are
they
who
made
a
theogony
for
the
hellenes
and
gave
the
titles
to
the
gods
and
distributed
to
them
honours
and
arts
and
set
forth
their
forms
but
the
poets
who
are
said
to
have
been
before
these
men
were
really
in
my
opinion
after
them
of
these
things
the
first
are
said
by
the
priestesses
of
dodona
and
the
latter
things
those
namely
which
have
regard
to
hesiod
and
homer
by
myself
as
regards
the
oracles
both
that
among
the
hellenes
and
that
in
libya
the
egyptians
tell
the
following
tale
the
priests
of
the
theban
zeus
told
me
that
two
women
in
the
service
of
the
temple
had
been
carried
away
from
thebes
by
phenicians
and
that
they
had
heard
that
one
of
them
had
been
sold
to
go
into
libya
and
the
other
to
the
hellenes
and
these
women
they
said
were
they
who
first
founded
the
prophetic
seats
among
the
nations
which
have
been
named
and
when
i
inquired
whence
they
knew
so
perfectly
of
this
tale
which
they
told
they
said
in
reply
that
a
great
search
had
been
made
by
the
priests
after
these
women
and
that
they
had
not
been
able
to
find
them
but
they
had
heard
afterwards
this
tale
about
them
which
they
were
telling
this
i
heard
from
the
priests
at
thebes
and
what
follows
is
said
by
the
prophetesses
of
dodona
they
say
that
two
black
doves
flew
from
thebes
to
egypt
and
came
one
of
them
to
libya
and
the
other
to
their
land
and
this
latter
settled
upon
an
and
spoke
with
human
voice
saying
that
it
was
necessary
that
a
prophetic
seat
of
zeus
should
be
established
in
that
place
and
they
supposed
that
that
was
of
the
gods
which
was
announced
to
them
and
made
one
accordingly
and
the
dove
which
went
away
to
the
libyans
they
say
bade
the
libyans
to
make
an
oracle
of
ammon
and
this
also
is
of
zeus
the
priestesses
of
dodona
told
me
these
things
of
whom
the
eldest
was
named
promeneia
the
next
after
her
timarete
and
the
youngest
nicandra
and
the
other
people
of
dodona
who
were
engaged
about
the
temple
gave
accounts
agreeing
with
theirs
i
however
have
an
opinion
about
the
matter
as
follows
the
phenicians
did
in
truth
carry
away
the
consecrated
women
and
sold
one
of
them
into
libya
and
the
other
into
hellas
i
suppose
that
in
the
country
now
called
hellas
which
was
formerly
called
pelasgia
this
woman
was
sold
into
the
land
of
the
thesprotians
and
then
being
a
slave
there
she
set
up
a
sanctuary
of
zeus
under
a
real
as
indeed
it
was
natural
that
being
an
attendant
of
the
sanctuary
of
zeus
at
thebes
she
should
there
in
the
place
to
which
she
had
come
have
a
memory
of
him
and
after
this
when
she
got
understanding
of
the
hellenic
tongue
she
established
an
oracle
and
she
reported
i
suppose
that
her
sister
had
been
sold
in
libya
by
the
same
phenicians
by
whom
she
herself
had
been
sold
moreover
i
think
that
the
women
were
called
doves
by
the
people
of
dodona
for
the
reason
that
they
were
barbarians
and
because
it
seemed
to
them
that
they
uttered
voice
like
birds
but
after
a
time
they
say
the
dove
spoke
with
human
voice
that
is
when
the
woman
began
to
speak
so
that
they
could
understand
but
so
long
as
she
spoke
a
barbarian
tongue
she
seemed
to
them
to
be
uttering
voice
like
a
bird
for
had
it
been
really
a
dove
how
could
it
speak
with
human
voice
and
in
saying
that
the
dove
was
black
they
indicate
that
the
woman
was
egyptian
the
ways
of
delivering
oracles
too
at
thebes
in
egypt
and
at
dodona
closely
resemble
one
another
as
it
happens
and
also
the
method
of
divination
by
victims
has
come
from
egypt
moreover
it
is
true
also
that
the
egyptians
were
the
first
of
men
who
made
solemn
assemblies
and
processions
and
approaches
to
the
temples
and
from
them
the
hellenes
have
learnt
them
and
my
evidence
for
this
is
that
the
egyptian
celebrations
of
these
have
been
held
from
a
very
ancient
time
whereas
the
hellenic
were
introduced
but
lately
the
egyptians
hold
their
solemn
assemblies
not
once
in
the
year
but
often
especially
and
with
the
greatest
zeal
and
devotion
at
the
city
of
bubastis
for
artemis
and
next
at
busiris
for
isis
for
in
this
city
there
is
a
very
great
temple
of
isis
and
this
city
stands
in
the
middle
of
the
delta
of
egypt
now
isis
is
in
the
tongue
of
the
hellenes
demeter
thirdly
they
have
a
solemn
assembly
at
the
city
of
saïs
for
athene
fourthly
at
heliopolis
for
the
sun
helios
fifthly
at
the
city
of
buto
in
honour
of
leto
and
sixthly
at
the
city
of
papremis
for
ares
now
when
they
are
coming
to
the
city
of
bubastis
they
do
as
follows
sail
men
and
women
together
and
a
great
multitude
of
each
sex
in
every
boat
and
some
of
the
women
have
rattles
and
rattle
with
them
while
some
of
the
men
play
the
flute
during
the
whole
time
of
the
voyage
and
the
rest
both
women
and
men
sing
and
clap
their
hands
and
when
as
they
sail
they
come
opposite
to
any
city
on
the
way
they
bring
the
boat
to
land
and
some
of
the
women
continue
to
do
as
i
have
said
others
cry
aloud
and
jeer
at
the
women
in
that
city
some
dance
and
some
stand
up
and
pull
up
their
garments
this
they
do
by
every
city
along
the
and
when
they
come
to
bubastis
they
hold
festival
celebrating
great
sacrifices
and
more
wine
of
grapes
is
consumed
upon
that
festival
than
during
the
whole
of
the
rest
of
the
year
to
this
place
so
say
the
natives
they
come
together
year
by
year
even
to
the
number
of
seventy
myriads
of
men
and
women
besides
children
thus
it
is
done
here
and
how
they
celebrate
the
festival
in
honour
of
isis
at
the
city
of
busiris
has
been
told
by
me
before
for
as
i
said
they
beat
themselves
in
mourning
after
the
sacrifice
all
of
them
both
men
and
women
very
many
myriads
of
people
but
for
whom
they
beat
themselves
it
is
not
permitted
to
me
by
religion
to
say
and
so
many
as
there
are
of
the
carians
dwelling
in
egypt
do
this
even
more
than
the
egyptians
themselves
inasmuch
as
they
cut
their
foreheads
also
with
knives
and
by
this
it
is
manifested
that
they
are
strangers
and
not
egyptians
at
the
times
when
they
gather
together
at
the
city
of
saïs
for
their
sacrifices
on
a
certain
night
they
all
kindle
lamps
many
in
number
in
the
open
air
round
about
the
houses
now
the
lamps
are
saucers
full
of
salt
and
oil
mixed
and
the
wick
floats
by
itself
on
the
surface
and
this
burns
during
the
whole
night
and
to
the
festival
is
given
the
name
lychnocaia
the
lighting
of
the
lamps
moreover
those
of
the
egyptians
who
have
not
come
to
this
solemn
assembly
observe
the
night
of
the
festival
and
themselves
also
light
lamps
all
of
them
and
thus
not
in
saïs
alone
are
they
lighted
but
over
all
egypt
and
as
to
the
reason
why
light
and
honour
are
allotted
to
this
night
about
this
there
is
a
sacred
story
told
to
heliopolis
and
buto
they
go
year
by
year
and
do
sacrifice
only
but
at
papremis
they
do
sacrifice
and
worship
as
elsewhere
and
besides
that
when
the
sun
begins
to
go
down
while
some
few
of
the
priests
are
occupied
with
the
image
of
the
god
the
greater
number
of
them
stand
in
the
entrance
of
the
temple
with
wooden
clubs
and
other
persons
to
the
number
of
more
than
a
thousand
men
with
purpose
to
perform
a
vow
these
also
having
all
of
them
staves
of
wood
stand
in
a
body
opposite
to
those
and
the
image
which
is
in
a
small
shrine
of
wood
covered
over
with
gold
they
take
out
on
the
day
before
to
another
sacred
building
the
few
then
who
have
been
left
about
the
image
draw
a
wain
with
four
wheels
which
bears
the
shrine
and
the
image
that
is
within
the
shrine
and
the
other
priests
standing
in
the
gateway
try
to
prevent
it
from
entering
and
the
men
who
are
under
a
vow
come
to
the
assistance
of
the
god
and
strike
them
while
the
others
defend
themselves
then
there
comes
to
be
a
hard
fight
with
staves
and
they
break
one
heads
and
i
am
of
opinion
that
many
even
die
of
the
wounds
they
receive
the
egyptians
however
told
me
that
no
one
died
this
solemn
assembly
the
people
of
the
place
say
that
they
established
for
the
following
reason
mother
of
ares
they
say
used
to
dwell
in
this
temple
and
ares
having
been
brought
up
away
from
her
when
he
grew
up
came
thither
desiring
to
visit
his
mother
and
the
attendants
of
his
mother
temple
not
having
seen
him
before
did
not
permit
him
to
pass
in
but
kept
him
away
and
he
brought
men
to
help
him
from
another
city
and
handled
roughly
the
attendants
of
the
temple
and
entered
to
visit
his
mother
hence
they
say
this
exchange
of
blows
has
become
the
custom
in
honour
of
ares
upon
his
festival
the
egyptians
were
the
first
who
made
it
a
point
of
religion
not
to
lie
with
women
in
temples
nor
to
enter
into
temples
after
going
away
from
women
without
first
bathing
for
almost
all
other
men
except
the
egyptians
and
the
hellenes
lie
with
women
in
temples
and
enter
into
a
temple
after
going
away
from
women
without
bathing
since
they
hold
that
there
is
no
difference
in
this
respect
between
men
and
beasts
for
they
say
that
they
see
beasts
and
the
various
kinds
of
birds
coupling
together
both
in
the
temples
and
in
the
sacred
enclosures
of
the
gods
if
then
this
were
not
pleasing
to
the
god
the
beasts
would
not
do
so
thus
do
these
defend
that
which
they
do
which
by
me
is
disallowed
but
the
egyptians
are
excessively
careful
in
their
observances
both
in
other
matters
which
concern
the
sacred
rites
and
also
in
those
which
follow
though
it
borders
upon
libya
does
not
very
much
abound
in
wild
animals
but
such
as
they
have
are
one
and
all
accounted
by
them
sacred
some
of
them
living
with
men
and
others
not
but
if
i
should
say
for
what
reasons
the
sacred
animals
have
been
thus
dedicated
i
should
fall
into
discourse
of
matters
pertaining
to
the
gods
of
which
i
most
desire
not
to
speak
and
what
i
have
actually
said
touching
slightly
upon
them
i
said
because
i
was
constrained
by
necessity
about
these
animals
there
is
a
custom
of
this
kind
have
been
appointed
of
the
egyptians
both
men
and
women
to
provide
the
food
for
each
kind
of
beast
separately
and
their
office
goes
down
from
father
to
son
and
those
who
dwell
in
the
various
cities
perform
vows
to
them
thus
that
is
when
they
make
a
vow
to
the
god
to
whom
the
animal
belongs
they
shave
the
head
of
their
children
either
the
whole
or
the
half
or
the
third
part
of
it
and
then
set
the
hair
in
the
balance
against
silver
and
whatever
it
weighs
this
the
man
gives
to
the
person
who
provides
for
the
animals
and
she
cuts
up
fish
of
equal
value
and
gives
it
for
food
to
the
animals
thus
food
for
their
support
has
been
appointed
and
if
any
one
kill
any
of
these
animals
the
penalty
if
he
do
it
with
his
own
will
is
death
and
if
against
his
will
such
penalty
as
the
priests
may
appoint
but
whosoever
shall
kill
an
ibis
or
a
hawk
whether
it
be
with
his
will
or
against
his
will
must
die
of
the
animals
that
live
with
men
there
are
great
numbers
and
would
be
many
more
but
for
the
accidents
which
befall
the
cats
for
when
the
females
have
produced
young
they
are
no
longer
in
the
habit
of
going
to
the
males
and
these
seeking
to
be
united
with
them
are
not
able
to
this
end
then
they
contrive
as
follows
either
take
away
by
force
or
remove
secretly
the
young
from
the
females
and
kill
them
but
after
killing
they
do
not
eat
them
and
the
females
being
deprived
of
their
young
and
desiring
more
therefore
come
to
the
males
for
it
is
a
creature
that
is
fond
of
its
young
moreover
when
a
fire
occurs
the
cats
seem
to
be
divinely
possessed
for
while
the
egyptians
stand
at
intervals
and
look
after
the
cats
not
taking
any
care
to
extinguish
the
fire
the
cats
slipping
through
or
leaping
over
the
men
jump
into
the
fire
and
when
this
happens
great
mourning
comes
upon
the
egyptians
and
in
whatever
houses
a
cat
has
died
by
a
natural
death
all
those
who
dwell
in
this
house
shave
their
eyebrows
only
but
those
in
whose
houses
a
dog
has
died
shave
their
whole
body
and
also
their
head
the
cats
when
they
are
dead
are
carried
away
to
sacred
buildings
in
the
city
of
bubastis
where
after
being
embalmed
they
are
buried
but
the
dogs
they
bury
each
people
in
their
own
city
in
sacred
tombs
and
the
ichneumons
are
buried
just
in
the
same
way
as
the
dogs
the
however
and
the
hawks
they
carry
away
to
the
city
of
buto
and
the
ibises
to
hermopolis
the
bears
which
are
not
commonly
seen
and
the
wolves
not
much
larger
in
size
than
foxes
they
bury
on
the
spot
where
they
are
found
lying
of
the
crocodile
the
nature
is
as
follows
the
four
most
wintry
months
this
creature
eats
nothing
she
has
four
feet
and
is
an
animal
belonging
to
the
land
and
the
water
both
for
she
produces
and
hatches
eggs
on
the
land
and
the
most
part
of
the
day
she
remains
upon
dry
land
but
the
whole
of
the
night
in
the
river
for
the
water
in
truth
is
warmer
than
the
unclouded
open
air
and
the
dew
of
all
the
mortal
creatures
of
which
we
have
knowledge
this
grows
to
the
greatest
bulk
from
the
smallest
beginning
for
the
eggs
which
she
produces
are
not
much
larger
than
those
of
geese
and
the
young
one
is
in
proportion
to
the
egg
but
as
he
grows
he
becomes
as
much
as
seventeen
cubits
long
and
sometimes
yet
larger
he
has
eyes
like
those
of
a
pig
and
teeth
large
and
tusky
in
proportion
to
the
size
of
his
body
but
unlike
all
other
beasts
he
grows
no
tongue
neither
does
he
move
his
lower
jaw
but
brings
the
upper
jaw
towards
the
lower
being
in
this
too
unlike
all
other
beasts
he
has
moreover
strong
claws
and
a
scaly
hide
upon
his
back
which
can
not
be
pierced
and
he
is
blind
in
the
water
but
in
the
air
he
is
of
very
keen
sight
since
he
has
his
living
in
the
water
he
keeps
his
mouth
all
full
within
of
leeches
and
whereas
all
other
birds
and
beasts
fly
from
him
the
trochilus
is
a
creature
which
is
at
peace
with
him
seeing
that
from
her
he
receives
benefit
for
the
crocodile
having
come
out
of
the
water
to
the
land
and
then
having
opened
his
mouth
this
he
is
wont
to
do
generally
towards
the
west
wind
the
trochilus
upon
that
enters
into
his
mouth
and
swallows
down
the
leeches
and
he
being
benefited
is
pleased
and
does
no
harm
to
the
trochilus
now
for
some
of
the
egyptians
the
crocodiles
are
sacred
animals
and
for
others
not
so
but
they
treat
them
on
the
contrary
as
enemies
those
however
who
dwell
about
thebes
and
about
the
lake
of
moiris
hold
them
to
be
most
sacred
and
each
of
these
two
peoples
keeps
one
crocodile
selected
from
the
whole
number
which
has
been
trained
to
tameness
and
they
put
hanging
ornaments
of
molten
stone
and
of
gold
into
the
ears
of
these
and
anklets
round
the
front
feet
and
they
give
them
food
appointed
and
victims
of
sacrifices
and
treat
them
as
well
as
possible
while
they
live
and
after
they
are
dead
they
bury
them
in
sacred
tombs
embalming
them
but
those
who
dwell
about
the
city
of
elephantine
even
eat
them
not
holding
them
to
be
sacred
they
are
called
not
crocodiles
but
champsai
and
the
ionians
gave
them
the
name
of
crocodile
comparing
their
form
to
that
of
the
crocodiles
lizards
which
appear
in
their
country
in
the
stone
walls
there
are
many
ways
in
use
of
catching
them
and
of
various
kinds
i
shall
describe
that
which
to
me
seems
the
most
worthy
of
being
told
a
man
puts
the
back
of
a
pig
upon
a
hook
as
bait
and
lets
it
go
into
the
middle
of
the
river
while
he
himself
upon
the
bank
of
the
river
has
a
young
live
pig
which
he
beats
and
the
crocodile
hearing
its
cries
makes
for
the
direction
of
the
sound
and
when
he
finds
the
pig
back
he
swallows
it
down
then
they
pull
and
when
he
is
drawn
out
to
land
first
of
all
the
hunter
forthwith
plasters
up
his
eyes
with
mud
and
having
so
done
he
very
easily
gets
the
mastery
of
him
but
if
he
does
not
do
so
he
has
much
trouble
the
is
sacred
in
the
district
of
papremis
but
for
the
other
egyptians
he
is
not
sacred
and
this
is
the
appearance
which
he
presents
he
is
like
an
ox
with
a
mane
like
a
horse
and
showing
teeth
like
tusks
with
a
tail
and
voice
like
a
horse
and
in
size
as
large
as
the
largest
ox
and
his
hide
is
so
exceedingly
thick
that
when
it
has
been
dried
shafts
of
javelins
are
made
of
it
there
are
moreover
otters
in
the
river
which
they
consider
to
be
sacred
and
of
fish
also
they
esteem
that
which
is
called
the
lepidotos
to
be
sacred
and
also
the
eel
and
these
they
say
are
sacred
to
the
nile
and
of
birds
the
there
is
also
another
sacred
bird
called
the
phoenix
which
i
did
not
myself
see
except
in
painting
for
in
truth
he
comes
to
them
very
rarely
at
intervals
as
the
people
of
heliopolis
say
of
five
hundred
years
and
these
say
that
he
comes
regularly
when
his
father
dies
and
if
he
be
like
the
painting
he
is
of
this
size
and
nature
that
is
to
say
some
of
his
feathers
are
of
gold
colour
and
others
red
and
in
outline
and
size
he
is
as
nearly
as
possible
like
an
eagle
this
bird
they
say
but
i
can
not
believe
the
story
contrives
as
follows
forth
from
arabia
he
conveys
his
father
they
say
to
the
temple
of
the
sun
helios
plastered
up
in
myrrh
and
buries
him
in
the
temple
of
the
sun
and
he
conveys
him
thus
forms
first
an
egg
of
myrrh
as
large
as
he
is
able
to
carry
and
then
he
makes
trial
of
carrying
it
and
when
he
has
made
trial
sufficiently
then
he
hollows
out
the
egg
and
places
his
father
within
it
and
plasters
over
with
other
myrrh
that
part
of
the
egg
where
he
hollowed
it
out
to
put
his
father
in
and
when
his
father
is
laid
in
it
it
proves
they
say
to
be
of
the
same
weight
as
it
was
and
after
he
has
plastered
it
up
he
conveys
the
whole
to
egypt
to
the
temple
of
the
sun
thus
they
say
that
this
bird
does
there
are
also
about
thebes
sacred
serpents
not
at
all
harmful
to
men
which
are
small
in
size
and
have
two
horns
growing
from
the
top
of
the
head
these
they
bury
when
they
die
in
the
temple
of
zeus
for
to
this
god
they
say
that
they
are
sacred
there
is
a
region
moreover
in
arabia
situated
nearly
over
against
the
city
of
buto
to
which
place
i
came
to
inquire
about
the
winged
serpents
and
when
i
came
thither
i
saw
bones
of
serpents
and
spines
in
quantity
so
great
that
it
is
impossible
to
make
report
of
the
number
and
there
were
heaps
of
spines
some
heaps
large
and
others
less
large
and
others
smaller
still
than
these
and
these
heaps
were
many
in
number
this
region
in
which
the
spines
are
scattered
upon
the
ground
is
of
the
nature
of
an
entrance
from
a
narrow
mountain
pass
to
a
great
plain
which
plain
adjoins
the
plain
of
egypt
and
the
story
goes
that
at
the
beginning
of
spring
winged
serpents
from
arabia
fly
towards
egypt
and
the
birds
called
ibises
meet
them
at
the
entrance
to
this
country
and
do
not
suffer
the
serpents
to
go
by
but
kill
them
on
account
of
this
deed
it
is
say
the
arabians
that
the
ibis
has
come
to
be
greatly
honoured
by
the
egyptians
and
the
egyptians
also
agree
that
it
is
for
this
reason
that
they
honour
these
birds
the
outward
form
of
the
ibis
is
this
is
a
deep
black
all
over
and
has
legs
like
those
of
a
crane
and
a
very
curved
beak
and
in
size
it
is
about
equal
to
a
rail
this
is
the
appearance
of
the
black
kind
which
fight
with
the
serpents
but
of
those
which
most
crowd
round
feet
for
there
are
two
several
kinds
of
ibises
the
head
is
bare
and
also
the
whole
of
the
throat
and
it
is
white
in
feathering
except
the
head
and
neck
and
the
extremities
of
the
wings
and
the
rump
in
all
these
parts
of
which
i
have
spoken
it
is
a
deep
black
while
in
legs
and
in
the
form
of
the
head
it
resembles
the
other
as
for
the
serpent
its
form
is
like
that
of
the
watersnake
and
it
has
wings
not
feathered
but
most
nearly
resembling
the
wings
of
the
bat
let
so
much
suffice
as
has
been
said
now
concerning
sacred
animals
of
the
egyptians
themselves
those
who
dwell
in
the
part
of
egypt
which
is
sown
for
crops
practise
memory
more
than
any
other
men
and
are
the
most
learned
in
history
by
far
of
all
those
of
whom
i
have
had
experience
and
their
manner
of
life
is
as
follows
three
successive
days
in
each
month
they
purge
hunting
after
health
with
emetics
and
clysters
and
they
think
that
all
the
diseases
which
exist
are
produced
in
men
by
the
food
on
which
they
live
for
the
egyptians
are
from
other
causes
also
the
most
healthy
of
all
men
next
after
the
libyans
in
my
opinion
on
account
of
the
seasons
because
the
seasons
do
not
change
for
by
the
changes
of
things
generally
and
especially
of
the
seasons
diseases
are
most
apt
to
be
produced
in
men
and
as
to
their
diet
it
is
as
follows
eat
bread
making
loaves
of
maize
which
they
call
kyllestis
and
they
use
habitually
a
wine
made
out
of
barley
for
vines
they
have
not
in
their
land
of
their
fish
some
they
dry
in
the
sun
and
then
eat
them
without
cooking
others
they
eat
cured
in
brine
of
birds
they
eat
quails
and
ducks
and
small
birds
without
cooking
after
first
curing
them
and
everything
else
which
they
have
belonging
to
the
class
of
birds
or
fishes
except
such
as
have
been
set
apart
by
them
as
sacred
they
eat
roasted
or
boiled
in
the
entertainments
of
the
rich
among
them
when
they
have
finished
eating
a
man
bears
round
a
wooden
figure
of
a
dead
body
in
a
coffin
made
as
like
the
reality
as
may
be
both
by
painting
and
carving
and
measuring
about
a
cubit
or
two
cubits
each
way
and
this
he
shows
to
each
of
those
who
are
drinking
together
saying
when
thou
lookest
upon
this
drink
and
be
merry
for
thou
shalt
be
such
as
this
when
thou
art
dead
thus
they
do
at
their
carousals
the
customs
which
they
practise
are
derived
from
their
fathers
and
they
do
not
acquire
others
in
addition
but
besides
other
customary
things
among
them
which
are
worthy
of
mention
they
have
one
song
that
of
linos
the
same
who
is
sung
of
both
in
phenicia
and
in
cyprus
and
elsewhere
having
however
a
name
different
according
to
the
various
nations
this
song
agrees
exactly
with
that
which
the
hellenes
sing
calling
on
the
name
of
linos
so
that
besides
many
other
things
about
which
i
wonder
among
those
matters
which
concern
egypt
i
wonder
especially
about
this
namely
whence
they
got
the
song
of
linos
it
is
evident
however
that
they
have
sung
this
song
from
immemorial
time
and
in
the
egyptian
tongue
linos
is
called
maneros
the
egyptians
told
me
that
he
was
the
only
son
of
him
who
first
became
king
of
egypt
and
that
he
died
before
his
time
and
was
honoured
with
these
lamentations
by
the
egyptians
and
that
this
was
their
first
and
only
song
in
another
respect
the
egyptians
are
in
agreement
with
some
of
the
hellenes
namely
with
the
lacedemonians
but
not
with
the
rest
that
is
to
say
the
younger
of
them
when
they
meet
the
elder
give
way
and
move
out
of
the
path
and
when
their
elders
approach
they
rise
out
of
their
seat
in
this
which
follows
however
they
are
not
in
agreement
with
any
of
the
hellenes
of
addressing
one
another
in
the
roads
they
do
reverence
lowering
their
hand
down
to
their
knee
they
wear
tunics
of
linen
about
their
legs
with
fringes
which
they
call
calasiris
above
these
they
have
garments
of
white
wool
thrown
over
woollen
garments
however
are
not
taken
into
the
temples
nor
are
they
buried
with
them
for
this
is
not
permitted
by
religion
in
these
points
they
are
in
agreement
with
the
observances
called
orphic
and
bacchic
which
are
really
egyptian
and
also
with
those
of
the
pythagoreans
for
one
who
takes
part
in
these
mysteries
is
also
forbidden
by
religious
rule
to
be
buried
in
woollen
garments
and
about
this
there
is
a
sacred
story
told
besides
these
things
the
egyptians
have
found
out
also
to
what
god
each
month
and
each
day
belongs
and
what
fortunes
a
man
will
meet
with
who
is
born
on
any
particular
day
and
how
he
will
die
and
what
kind
of
a
man
he
will
be
and
these
inventions
were
taken
up
by
those
of
the
hellenes
who
occupied
themselves
about
poesy
portents
too
have
been
found
out
by
them
more
than
by
all
other
men
besides
for
when
a
portent
has
happened
they
observe
and
write
down
the
event
which
comes
of
it
and
if
ever
afterwards
anything
resembling
this
happens
they
believe
that
the
event
which
comes
of
it
will
be
similar
their
divination
is
ordered
thus
art
is
assigned
not
to
any
man
but
to
certain
of
the
gods
for
there
are
in
their
land
oracles
of
heracles
of
apollo
of
athene
of
artemis
of
ares
and
of
zeus
and
moreover
that
which
they
hold
most
in
honour
of
all
namely
the
oracle
of
leto
which
is
in
the
city
of
buto
the
manner
of
divination
however
is
not
yet
established
among
them
according
to
the
same
fashion
everywhere
but
is
different
in
different
places
the
art
of
medicine
among
them
is
distributed
thus
physician
is
a
physician
of
one
disease
and
of
no
more
and
the
whole
country
is
full
of
physicians
for
some
profess
themselves
to
be
physicians
of
the
eyes
others
of
the
head
others
of
the
teeth
others
of
the
affections
of
the
stomach
and
others
of
the
more
obscure
ailments
their
fashions
of
mourning
and
of
burial
are
these
any
household
has
lost
a
man
who
is
of
any
regard
amongst
them
the
whole
number
of
women
of
that
house
forthwith
plaster
over
their
heads
or
even
their
faces
with
mud
then
leaving
the
corpse
within
the
house
they
go
themselves
to
and
fro
about
the
city
and
beat
themselves
with
their
garments
bound
up
by
a
girdle
and
their
breasts
exposed
and
with
them
go
all
the
women
who
are
related
to
the
dead
man
and
on
the
other
side
the
men
beat
themselves
they
too
having
their
garments
bound
up
by
a
girdle
and
when
they
have
done
this
they
then
convey
the
body
to
the
embalming
in
this
occupation
certain
persons
employ
themselves
regularly
and
inherit
this
as
a
craft
these
whenever
a
corpse
is
conveyed
to
them
show
to
those
who
brought
it
wooden
models
of
corpses
made
like
reality
by
painting
and
the
best
of
the
ways
of
embalming
they
say
is
that
of
him
whose
name
i
think
it
impiety
to
mention
when
speaking
of
a
matter
of
such
a
kind
the
second
which
they
show
is
less
good
than
this
and
also
less
expensive
and
the
third
is
the
least
expensive
of
all
having
told
them
about
this
they
inquire
of
them
in
which
way
they
desire
the
corpse
of
their
friend
to
be
prepared
then
they
after
they
have
agreed
for
a
certain
price
depart
out
of
the
way
and
the
others
being
left
behind
in
the
buildings
embalm
according
to
the
best
of
these
ways
thus
with
a
crooked
iron
tool
they
draw
out
the
brain
through
the
nostrils
extracting
it
partly
thus
and
partly
by
pouring
in
drugs
and
after
this
with
a
sharp
stone
of
ethiopia
they
make
a
cut
along
the
side
and
take
out
the
whole
contents
of
the
belly
and
when
they
have
cleared
out
the
cavity
and
cleansed
it
with
they
cleanse
it
again
with
spices
pounded
up
then
they
fill
the
belly
with
pure
myrrh
pounded
up
and
with
cassia
and
other
spices
except
frankincense
and
sew
it
together
again
having
so
done
they
keep
it
for
embalming
covered
up
in
natron
for
seventy
days
but
for
a
longer
time
than
this
it
is
not
permitted
to
embalm
it
and
when
the
seventy
days
are
past
they
wash
the
corpse
and
roll
its
whole
body
up
in
fine
linen
cut
into
bands
smearing
these
beneath
with
gum
which
the
egyptians
use
generally
instead
of
glue
then
the
kinsfolk
receive
it
from
them
and
have
a
wooden
figure
made
in
the
shape
of
a
man
and
when
they
have
had
this
made
they
enclose
the
corpse
and
having
shut
it
up
within
they
store
it
then
in
a
sepulchral
chamber
setting
it
to
stand
upright
against
the
wall
thus
they
deal
with
the
corpses
which
are
prepared
in
the
most
costly
way
but
for
those
who
desire
the
middle
way
and
wish
to
avoid
great
cost
they
prepare
the
corpse
as
follows
filled
their
syringes
with
the
oil
which
is
got
from
with
this
they
forthwith
fill
the
belly
of
the
corpse
and
this
they
do
without
having
either
cut
it
open
or
taken
out
the
bowels
but
they
inject
the
oil
by
the
breech
and
having
stopped
the
drench
from
returning
back
they
keep
it
then
the
appointed
number
of
days
for
embalming
and
on
the
last
of
the
days
they
let
the
cedar
oil
come
out
from
the
belly
which
they
before
put
in
and
it
has
such
power
that
it
brings
out
with
it
the
bowels
and
interior
organs
of
the
body
dissolved
and
the
natron
dissolves
the
flesh
so
that
there
is
left
of
the
corpse
only
the
skin
and
the
bones
when
they
have
done
this
they
give
back
the
corpse
at
once
in
that
condition
without
working
upon
it
any
more
the
third
kind
of
embalming
by
which
are
prepared
the
bodies
of
those
who
have
less
means
is
as
follows
cleanse
out
the
belly
with
a
purge
and
then
keep
the
body
for
embalming
during
the
seventy
days
and
at
once
after
that
they
give
it
back
to
the
bringers
to
carry
away
the
wives
of
men
of
rank
when
they
die
are
not
given
at
once
to
be
embalmed
nor
such
women
as
are
very
beautiful
or
of
greater
regard
than
others
but
on
the
third
or
fourth
day
after
their
death
and
not
before
they
are
delivered
to
the
embalmers
they
do
so
about
this
matter
in
order
that
the
embalmers
may
not
abuse
their
women
for
they
say
that
one
of
them
was
taken
once
doing
so
to
the
corpse
of
a
woman
lately
dead
and
his
gave
information
whenever
any
one
either
of
the
egyptians
themselves
or
of
strangers
is
found
to
have
been
carried
off
by
a
crocodile
or
brought
to
his
death
by
the
river
itself
the
people
of
any
city
by
which
he
may
have
been
cast
up
on
land
must
embalm
him
and
lay
him
out
in
the
fairest
way
they
can
and
bury
him
in
a
sacred
nor
may
any
of
his
relations
or
friends
besides
touch
him
but
the
priests
of
the
nile
themselves
handle
the
corpse
and
bury
it
as
that
of
one
who
was
something
more
than
man
hellenic
usages
they
will
by
no
means
follow
and
to
speak
generally
they
follow
those
of
no
other
men
whatever
this
rule
is
observed
by
most
of
the
egyptians
but
there
is
a
large
city
named
chemmis
in
the
theban
district
near
neapolis
and
in
this
city
there
is
a
temple
of
perseus
the
son
of
danae
which
is
of
a
square
shape
and
round
it
grow
the
gateway
of
the
temple
is
built
of
stone
and
of
very
great
size
and
at
the
entrance
of
it
stand
two
great
statues
of
stone
within
this
enclosure
is
a
and
in
it
stands
an
image
of
perseus
these
people
of
chemmis
say
that
perseus
is
wont
often
to
appear
in
their
land
and
often
within
the
temple
and
that
a
sandal
which
has
been
worn
by
him
is
found
sometimes
being
in
length
two
cubits
and
whenever
this
appears
all
egypt
prospers
this
they
say
and
they
do
in
honour
of
perseus
after
hellenic
fashion
thus
hold
an
athletic
contest
which
includes
the
whole
list
of
games
and
they
offer
in
prizes
cattle
and
cloaks
and
skins
and
when
i
inquired
why
to
them
alone
perseus
was
wont
to
appear
and
wherefore
they
were
separated
from
all
the
other
egyptians
in
that
they
held
an
athletic
contest
they
said
that
perseus
had
been
born
of
their
city
for
danaos
and
lynkeus
were
men
of
chemmis
and
had
sailed
to
hellas
and
from
them
they
traced
a
descent
and
came
down
to
perseus
and
they
told
me
that
he
had
come
to
egypt
for
the
reason
which
the
hellenes
also
say
namely
to
bring
from
libya
the
gorgon
head
and
had
then
visited
them
also
and
recognised
all
his
kinsfolk
and
they
said
that
he
had
well
learnt
the
name
of
chemmis
before
he
came
to
egypt
since
he
had
heard
it
from
his
mother
and
that
they
celebrated
an
athletic
contest
for
him
by
his
own
command
all
these
are
customs
practised
by
the
egyptians
who
dwell
above
the
fens
and
those
who
are
settled
in
the
have
the
same
customs
for
the
most
part
as
the
other
egyptians
both
in
other
matters
and
also
in
that
they
live
each
with
one
wife
only
as
do
the
hellenes
but
for
economy
in
respect
of
food
they
have
invented
these
things
besides
the
river
has
become
full
and
the
plains
have
been
flooded
there
grow
in
the
water
great
numbers
of
lilies
which
the
egyptians
call
lotos
these
they
cut
with
a
sickle
and
dry
in
the
sun
and
then
they
pound
that
which
grows
in
the
middle
of
the
lotos
and
which
is
like
the
head
of
a
poppy
and
they
make
of
it
loaves
baked
with
fire
the
root
also
of
this
lotos
is
edible
and
has
a
rather
sweet
taste
it
is
round
in
shape
and
about
the
size
of
an
apple
there
are
other
lilies
too
in
flower
resembling
roses
which
also
grow
in
the
river
and
from
them
the
fruit
is
produced
in
a
separate
vessel
springing
from
the
root
by
the
side
of
the
plant
itself
and
very
nearly
resembles
a
wasp
comb
in
this
there
grow
edible
seeds
in
great
numbers
of
the
size
of
an
and
they
are
eaten
either
fresh
or
dried
besides
this
they
pull
up
from
the
fens
the
papyrus
which
grows
every
year
and
the
upper
parts
of
it
they
cut
off
and
turn
to
other
uses
but
that
which
is
left
below
for
about
a
cubit
in
length
they
eat
or
sell
and
those
who
desire
to
have
the
papyrus
at
its
very
best
bake
it
in
an
oven
heated
and
then
eat
it
some
too
of
these
people
live
on
fish
alone
which
they
dry
in
the
sun
after
having
caught
them
and
taken
out
the
entrails
and
then
when
they
are
dry
they
use
them
for
food
fish
which
swim
in
shoals
are
not
much
produced
in
the
rivers
but
are
bred
in
the
lakes
and
they
do
as
follows
there
comes
upon
them
the
desire
to
breed
they
swim
out
in
shoals
towards
the
sea
and
the
males
lead
the
way
shedding
forth
their
milt
as
they
go
while
the
females
coming
after
and
swallowing
it
up
from
it
become
impregnated
and
when
they
have
become
full
of
young
in
the
sea
they
swim
up
back
again
each
shoal
to
its
own
haunts
the
same
however
no
longer
lead
the
way
as
before
but
the
lead
comes
now
to
the
females
and
they
leading
the
way
in
shoals
do
just
as
the
males
did
that
is
to
say
they
shed
forth
their
eggs
by
a
few
grains
at
a
time
and
the
males
coming
after
swallow
them
up
now
these
grains
are
fish
and
from
the
grains
which
survive
and
are
not
swallowed
the
fish
grow
which
afterwards
are
bred
up
now
those
of
the
fish
which
are
caught
as
they
swim
out
to
sea
are
found
to
be
rubbed
on
the
left
side
of
the
head
but
those
which
are
caught
as
they
swim
up
again
are
rubbed
on
the
right
side
this
happens
to
them
because
as
they
swim
down
to
the
sea
they
keep
close
to
the
land
on
the
left
side
of
the
river
and
again
as
they
swim
up
they
keep
to
the
same
side
approaching
and
touching
the
bank
as
much
as
they
can
for
fear
doubtless
of
straying
from
their
course
by
reason
of
the
stream
when
the
nile
begins
to
swell
the
hollow
places
of
the
land
and
the
depressions
by
the
side
of
the
river
first
begin
to
fill
as
the
water
soaks
through
from
the
river
and
so
soon
as
they
become
full
of
water
at
once
they
are
all
filled
with
little
fishes
and
whence
these
are
in
all
likelihood
produced
i
think
that
i
perceive
in
the
preceding
year
when
the
nile
goes
down
the
fish
first
lay
eggs
in
the
mud
and
then
retire
with
the
last
of
the
retreating
waters
and
when
the
time
comes
round
again
and
the
water
once
more
comes
over
the
land
from
these
eggs
forthwith
are
produced
the
fishes
of
which
i
speak
thus
it
is
as
regards
the
fish
and
for
anointing
those
of
the
egyptians
who
dwell
in
the
fens
use
oil
from
the
which
oil
the
egyptians
call
kiki
and
thus
they
do
sow
along
the
banks
of
the
rivers
and
pools
these
plants
which
in
a
wild
form
grow
of
themselves
in
the
land
of
the
hellenes
these
are
sown
in
egypt
and
produce
berries
in
great
quantity
but
of
an
evil
smell
and
when
they
have
gathered
these
some
cut
them
up
and
press
the
oil
from
them
others
again
roast
them
first
and
then
boil
them
down
and
collect
that
which
runs
away
from
them
the
oil
is
fat
and
not
less
suitable
for
burning
than
but
it
gives
forth
a
disagreeable
smell
against
the
gnats
which
are
very
abundant
they
have
contrived
as
follows
who
dwell
above
the
are
helped
by
the
towers
to
which
they
ascend
when
they
go
to
rest
for
the
gnats
by
reason
of
the
winds
are
not
able
to
fly
up
high
but
those
who
dwell
in
the
have
contrived
another
way
instead
of
the
towers
and
this
is
it
man
of
them
has
got
a
casting
net
with
which
by
day
he
catches
fish
but
in
the
night
he
uses
it
for
this
purpose
that
is
to
say
he
puts
the
round
about
the
bed
in
which
he
sleeps
and
then
creeps
in
under
it
and
goes
to
sleep
and
the
gnats
if
he
sleeps
rolled
up
in
a
garment
or
a
linen
sheet
bite
through
these
but
through
the
net
they
do
not
even
attempt
to
bite
their
boats
with
which
they
carry
cargoes
are
made
of
the
thorny
acacia
of
which
the
form
is
very
like
that
of
the
kyrenian
lotos
and
that
which
exudes
from
it
is
gum
from
this
tree
they
cut
pieces
of
wood
about
two
cubits
in
length
and
arrange
them
like
bricks
fastening
the
boat
together
by
running
a
great
number
of
long
bolts
through
the
pieces
and
when
they
have
thus
fastened
the
boat
together
they
lay
over
the
top
using
no
ribs
for
the
sides
and
within
they
caulk
the
seams
with
papyrus
they
make
one
for
it
which
is
passed
through
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
they
have
a
mast
of
acacia
and
sails
of
papyrus
these
boats
can
not
sail
up
the
river
unless
there
be
a
very
fresh
wind
blowing
but
are
towed
from
the
shore
however
they
travel
as
follows
have
a
crate
made
of
tamarisk
wood
and
reed
mats
sewn
together
and
also
a
stone
of
about
two
talents
weight
bored
with
a
hole
and
of
these
the
boatman
lets
the
crate
float
on
in
front
of
the
boat
fastened
with
a
rope
and
the
stone
drag
behind
by
another
rope
the
crate
then
as
the
force
of
the
stream
presses
upon
it
goes
on
swiftly
and
draws
on
the
baris
for
so
these
boats
are
called
while
the
stone
dragging
after
it
behind
and
sunk
deep
in
the
water
keeps
its
course
straight
these
boats
they
have
in
great
numbers
and
some
of
them
carry
many
thousands
of
talents
burden
when
the
nile
comes
over
the
land
the
cities
alone
are
seen
rising
above
the
water
resembling
more
nearly
than
anything
else
the
islands
in
the
egean
sea
for
the
rest
of
egypt
becomes
a
sea
and
the
cities
alone
rise
above
water
accordingly
whenever
this
happens
they
pass
by
water
not
now
by
the
channels
of
the
river
but
over
the
midst
of
the
plain
for
example
as
one
sails
up
from
naucratis
to
memphis
the
passage
is
then
close
by
the
pyramids
whereas
the
usual
passage
is
not
the
same
even
here
but
goes
by
the
point
of
the
delta
and
the
city
of
kercasoros
while
if
you
sail
over
the
plain
to
naucratis
from
the
sea
and
from
canobos
you
will
go
by
anthylla
and
the
city
called
after
archander
of
these
anthylla
is
a
city
of
note
and
is
especially
assigned
to
the
wife
of
him
who
reigns
over
egypt
to
supply
her
with
sandals
this
is
the
case
since
the
time
when
egypt
came
to
be
under
the
persians
the
other
city
seems
to
me
to
have
its
name
from
archander
the
of
danaos
who
was
the
son
of
phthios
the
son
of
achaios
for
it
is
called
the
city
of
archander
there
might
indeed
be
another
archander
but
in
any
case
the
name
is
not
egyptian
hitherto
my
own
observation
and
judgment
and
inquiry
are
the
vouchers
for
that
which
i
have
said
but
from
this
point
onwards
i
am
about
to
tell
the
history
of
egypt
according
to
that
which
i
heard
to
which
will
be
added
also
something
of
that
which
i
have
myself
seen
of
min
who
first
became
king
of
egypt
the
priests
said
that
on
the
one
hand
he
banked
off
the
site
of
memphis
from
the
river
for
the
whole
stream
of
the
river
used
to
flow
along
by
the
sandy
on
the
side
of
libya
but
min
formed
by
embankments
that
bend
of
the
river
which
lies
to
the
south
about
a
hundred
furlongs
above
memphis
and
thus
he
dried
up
the
old
stream
and
conducted
the
river
so
that
it
flowed
in
the
middle
between
the
mountains
and
even
now
this
bend
of
the
nile
is
by
the
persians
kept
under
very
careful
watch
that
it
may
flow
in
the
channel
to
which
it
is
confined
and
the
bank
is
repaired
every
year
for
if
the
river
should
break
through
and
overflow
in
this
direction
memphis
would
be
in
danger
of
being
overwhelmed
by
flood
when
this
min
who
first
became
king
had
made
into
dry
land
the
part
which
was
dammed
off
on
the
one
hand
i
say
he
founded
in
it
that
city
which
is
now
called
memphis
for
memphis
too
is
in
the
narrow
part
of
egypt
and
outside
the
city
he
dug
round
it
on
the
north
and
west
a
lake
communicating
with
the
river
for
the
side
towards
the
east
is
barred
by
the
nile
itself
then
secondly
he
established
in
the
city
the
temple
of
hephaistos
a
great
work
and
most
worthy
of
mention
after
this
man
the
priests
enumerated
to
me
from
a
papyrus
roll
the
names
of
other
kings
three
hundred
and
thirty
in
number
and
in
all
these
generations
of
men
eighteen
were
ethiopians
one
was
a
woman
a
native
egyptian
and
the
rest
were
men
and
of
egyptian
race
and
the
name
of
the
woman
who
reigned
was
the
same
as
that
of
the
babylonian
queen
namely
nitocris
of
her
they
said
that
desiring
to
take
vengeance
for
her
brother
whom
the
egyptians
had
slain
when
he
was
their
king
and
then
after
having
slain
him
had
given
his
kingdom
to
her
i
say
to
take
vengeance
for
him
she
destroyed
by
craft
many
of
the
egyptians
for
she
caused
to
be
constructed
a
very
large
chamber
under
ground
and
making
as
though
she
would
handsel
it
but
in
her
mind
devising
other
things
she
invited
those
of
the
egyptians
whom
she
knew
to
have
had
most
part
in
the
murder
and
gave
a
great
banquet
then
while
they
were
feasting
she
let
in
the
river
upon
them
by
a
secret
conduit
of
large
size
of
her
they
told
no
more
than
this
except
that
when
this
had
been
accomplished
she
threw
herself
into
a
room
full
of
embers
in
order
that
she
might
escape
vengeance
as
for
the
other
kings
they
could
tell
me
of
no
great
works
which
had
been
produced
by
them
and
they
said
that
they
had
no
renown
except
only
the
last
of
them
moris
he
they
said
produced
as
a
memorial
of
himself
the
gateway
of
the
temple
of
hephaistos
which
is
turned
towards
the
north
wind
and
dug
a
lake
about
which
i
shall
set
forth
afterwards
how
many
furlongs
of
circuit
it
has
and
in
it
built
pyramids
of
the
size
which
i
shall
mention
at
the
same
time
when
i
speak
of
the
lake
itself
he
they
said
produced
these
works
but
of
the
rest
none
produced
any
therefore
passing
these
by
i
shall
make
mention
of
the
king
who
came
after
these
whose
name
was
sesostris
he
the
priests
said
first
of
all
set
out
with
ships
of
war
from
the
arabian
gulf
and
subdued
those
who
dwelt
by
the
shores
of
the
erythraian
sea
until
as
he
sailed
he
came
to
a
sea
which
could
no
further
be
navigated
by
reason
of
shoals
then
secondly
after
he
had
returned
to
egypt
according
to
the
report
of
the
priests
he
took
a
great
army
and
marched
over
the
continent
subduing
every
nation
which
stood
in
his
way
and
those
of
them
whom
he
found
valiant
and
fighting
desperately
for
their
freedom
in
their
lands
he
set
up
pillars
which
told
by
inscriptions
his
own
name
and
the
name
of
his
country
and
how
he
had
subdued
them
by
his
power
but
as
to
those
of
whose
cities
he
obtained
possession
without
fighting
or
with
ease
on
their
pillars
he
inscribed
words
after
the
same
tenor
as
he
did
for
the
nations
which
had
shown
themselves
courageous
and
in
addition
he
drew
upon
them
the
hidden
parts
of
a
woman
desiring
to
signify
by
this
that
the
people
were
cowards
and
effeminate
thus
doing
he
traversed
the
continent
until
at
last
he
passed
over
to
europe
from
asia
and
subdued
the
scythians
and
also
the
thracians
these
i
am
of
opinion
were
the
furthest
people
to
which
the
egyptian
army
came
for
in
their
country
the
pillars
are
found
to
have
been
set
up
but
in
the
land
beyond
this
they
are
no
longer
found
from
this
point
he
turned
and
began
to
go
back
and
when
he
came
to
the
river
phasis
what
happened
then
i
can
not
say
for
certain
whether
the
king
sesostris
himself
divided
off
a
certain
portion
of
his
army
and
left
the
men
there
as
settlers
in
the
land
or
whether
some
of
his
soldiers
were
wearied
by
his
distant
marches
and
remained
by
the
river
phasis
for
the
people
of
colchis
are
evidently
egyptian
and
this
i
perceived
for
myself
before
i
heard
it
from
others
so
when
i
had
come
to
consider
the
matter
i
asked
them
both
and
the
colchians
had
remembrance
of
the
egyptians
more
than
the
egyptians
of
the
colchians
but
the
egyptians
said
they
believed
that
the
colchians
were
a
portion
of
the
army
of
sesostris
that
this
was
so
i
conjectured
myself
not
only
because
they
are
and
have
curly
hair
this
of
itself
amounts
to
nothing
for
there
are
other
races
which
are
so
but
also
still
more
because
the
colchians
egyptians
and
ethiopians
alone
of
all
the
races
of
men
have
practised
circumcision
from
the
first
the
phenicians
and
the
syrians
who
dwell
in
palestine
confess
themselves
that
they
have
learnt
it
from
the
egyptians
and
the
syrians
about
the
river
thermodon
and
the
river
parthenios
and
the
macronians
who
are
their
neighbours
say
that
they
have
learnt
it
lately
from
the
colchians
these
are
the
only
races
of
men
who
practise
circumcision
and
these
evidently
practise
it
in
the
same
manner
as
the
egyptians
of
the
egyptians
themselves
however
and
the
ethiopians
i
am
not
able
to
say
which
learnt
from
the
other
for
undoubtedly
it
is
a
most
ancient
custom
but
that
the
other
nations
learnt
it
by
intercourse
with
the
egyptians
this
among
others
is
to
me
a
strong
proof
namely
that
those
of
the
phenicians
who
have
intercourse
with
hellas
cease
to
follow
the
example
of
the
egyptians
in
this
matter
and
do
not
circumcise
their
children
now
let
me
tell
another
thing
about
the
colchians
to
show
how
they
resemble
the
egyptians
alone
work
flax
in
the
same
fashion
as
the
egyptians
and
the
two
nations
are
like
one
another
in
their
whole
manner
of
living
and
also
in
their
language
now
the
linen
of
colchis
is
called
by
the
hellenes
sardonic
whereas
that
from
egypt
is
called
egyptian
the
pillars
which
sesostris
of
egypt
set
up
in
the
various
countries
are
for
the
most
part
no
longer
to
be
seen
extant
but
in
syria
palestine
i
myself
saw
them
existing
with
the
inscription
upon
them
which
i
have
mentioned
and
the
emblem
moreover
in
ionia
there
are
two
figures
of
this
man
carved
upon
rocks
one
on
the
road
by
which
one
goes
from
the
land
of
ephesos
to
phocaia
and
the
other
on
the
road
from
sardis
to
smyrna
in
each
place
there
is
a
figure
of
a
man
cut
in
the
rock
of
four
cubits
and
a
span
in
height
holding
in
his
right
hand
a
spear
and
in
his
left
a
bow
and
arrows
and
the
other
equipment
which
he
has
is
similar
to
this
for
it
is
both
egyptian
and
ethiopian
and
from
the
one
shoulder
to
the
other
across
the
breast
runs
an
inscription
carved
in
sacred
egyptian
characters
saying
thus
this
land
with
my
shoulders
i
won
for
myself
but
who
he
is
and
from
whence
he
does
not
declare
in
these
places
though
in
other
places
he
has
declared
this
some
of
those
who
have
seen
these
carvings
conjecture
that
the
figure
is
that
of
memnon
but
herein
they
are
very
far
from
the
truth
as
this
egyptian
sesostris
was
returning
and
bringing
back
many
men
of
the
nations
whose
lands
he
had
subdued
when
he
came
said
the
priests
to
daphnai
in
the
district
of
pelusion
on
his
journey
home
his
brother
to
whom
sesostris
had
entrusted
the
charge
of
egypt
invited
him
and
with
him
his
sons
to
a
feast
and
then
he
piled
the
house
round
with
brushwood
and
set
it
on
fire
and
sesostris
when
he
discovered
this
forthwith
took
counsel
with
his
wife
for
he
was
bringing
with
him
they
said
his
wife
also
and
she
counselled
him
to
lay
out
upon
the
pyre
two
of
his
sons
which
were
six
in
number
and
so
to
make
a
bridge
over
the
burning
mass
and
that
they
passing
over
their
bodies
should
thus
escape
this
they
said
sesostris
did
and
two
of
his
sons
were
burnt
to
death
in
this
manner
but
the
rest
got
away
safe
with
their
father
then
sesostris
having
returned
to
egypt
and
having
taken
vengeance
on
his
brother
employed
the
multitude
which
he
had
brought
in
of
those
whose
lands
he
had
subdued
as
follows
were
they
who
drew
the
stones
which
in
the
reign
of
this
king
were
brought
to
the
temple
of
hephaistos
being
of
very
great
size
and
also
these
were
compelled
to
dig
all
the
channels
which
now
are
in
egypt
and
thus
having
no
such
purpose
they
caused
egypt
which
before
was
all
fit
for
riding
and
driving
to
be
no
longer
fit
for
this
from
thenceforth
for
from
that
time
forward
egypt
though
it
is
plain
land
has
become
all
unfit
for
riding
and
driving
and
the
cause
has
been
these
channels
which
are
many
and
run
in
all
directions
but
the
reason
why
the
king
cut
up
the
land
was
this
namely
because
those
of
the
egyptians
who
had
their
cities
not
on
the
river
but
in
the
middle
of
the
country
being
in
want
of
water
when
the
river
went
down
from
them
found
their
drink
brackish
because
they
had
it
from
wells
for
this
reason
egypt
was
cut
up
and
they
said
that
this
king
distributed
the
land
to
all
the
egyptians
giving
an
equal
square
portion
to
each
man
and
from
this
he
made
his
revenue
having
appointed
them
to
pay
a
certain
rent
every
year
and
if
the
river
should
take
away
anything
from
any
man
portion
he
would
come
to
the
king
and
declare
that
which
had
happened
and
the
king
used
to
send
men
to
examine
and
to
find
out
by
measurement
how
much
less
the
piece
of
land
had
become
in
order
that
for
the
future
the
man
might
pay
less
in
proportion
to
the
rent
appointed
and
i
think
that
thus
the
art
of
geometry
was
found
out
and
afterwards
came
into
hellas
also
for
as
touching
the
and
the
gnomon
and
the
twelve
divisions
of
the
day
they
were
learnt
by
the
hellenes
from
the
babylonians
he
moreover
alone
of
all
the
egyptian
kings
had
rule
over
ethiopia
and
he
left
as
memorials
of
himself
in
front
of
the
temple
of
hephaistos
two
stone
statues
of
thirty
cubits
each
representing
himself
and
his
wife
and
others
of
twenty
cubits
each
representing
his
four
sons
and
long
afterwards
the
priest
of
hephaistos
refused
to
permit
dareios
the
persian
to
set
up
a
statue
of
himself
in
front
of
them
saying
that
deeds
had
not
been
done
by
him
equal
to
those
which
were
done
by
sesostris
the
egyptian
for
sesostris
had
subdued
other
nations
besides
not
fewer
than
he
and
also
the
scythians
but
dareios
had
not
been
able
to
conquer
the
scythians
wherefore
it
was
not
just
that
he
should
set
up
a
statue
in
front
of
those
which
sesostris
had
dedicated
if
he
did
not
surpass
him
in
his
deeds
which
speech
they
say
dareios
took
in
good
part
now
after
sesostris
had
brought
his
life
to
an
end
his
son
pheros
they
told
me
received
in
succession
the
kingdom
and
he
made
no
warlike
expedition
and
moreover
it
chanced
to
him
to
become
blind
by
reason
of
the
following
accident
the
river
had
come
down
in
flood
rising
to
a
height
of
eighteen
cubits
higher
than
ever
before
that
time
and
had
gone
over
the
fields
a
wind
fell
upon
it
and
the
river
became
agitated
by
waves
and
this
king
they
say
moved
by
presumptuous
folly
took
a
spear
and
cast
it
into
the
midst
of
the
eddies
of
the
stream
and
immediately
upon
this
he
had
a
disease
of
the
eyes
and
was
by
it
made
blind
for
ten
years
then
he
was
blind
and
in
the
eleventh
year
there
came
to
him
an
oracle
from
the
city
of
buto
saying
that
the
time
of
his
punishment
had
expired
and
that
he
should
see
again
if
he
washed
his
eyes
with
the
water
of
a
woman
who
had
accompanied
with
her
own
husband
only
and
had
not
knowledge
of
other
men
and
first
he
made
trial
of
his
own
wife
and
then
as
he
continued
blind
he
went
on
to
try
all
the
women
in
turn
and
when
he
had
at
last
regained
his
sight
he
gathered
together
all
the
women
of
whom
he
had
made
trial
excepting
her
by
whose
means
he
had
regained
his
sight
to
one
city
which
now
is
named
erythrabolos
and
having
gathered
them
to
this
he
consumed
them
all
by
fire
as
well
as
the
city
itself
but
as
for
her
by
whose
means
he
had
regained
his
sight
he
had
her
himself
to
wife
then
after
he
had
escaped
the
malady
of
his
eyes
he
dedicated
offerings
at
each
one
of
the
temples
which
were
of
renown
and
especially
to
mention
only
that
which
is
most
worthy
of
mention
he
dedicated
at
the
temple
of
the
sun
works
which
are
worth
seeing
namely
two
obelisks
of
stone
each
of
a
single
block
measuring
in
length
a
hundred
cubits
each
one
and
in
breadth
eight
cubits
after
him
they
said
there
succeeded
to
the
throne
a
man
of
memphis
whose
name
in
the
tongue
of
the
hellenes
was
proteus
for
whom
there
is
now
a
sacred
enclosure
at
memphis
very
fair
and
well
ordered
lying
on
that
side
of
the
temple
of
hephaistos
which
faces
the
north
wind
round
about
this
enclosure
dwell
phenicians
of
tyre
and
this
whole
region
is
called
the
camp
of
the
tyrians
within
the
enclosure
of
proteus
there
is
a
temple
called
the
temple
of
the
foreign
aphrodite
which
temple
i
conjecture
to
be
one
of
helen
the
daughter
of
tyndareus
not
only
because
i
have
heard
the
tale
how
helen
dwelt
with
proteus
but
also
especially
because
it
is
called
by
the
name
of
the
foreign
aphrodite
for
the
other
temples
of
aphrodite
which
there
are
have
none
of
them
the
addition
of
the
word
foreign
to
the
name
and
the
priests
told
me
when
i
inquired
that
the
things
concerning
helen
happened
thus
having
carried
off
helen
was
sailing
away
from
sparta
to
his
own
land
and
when
he
had
come
to
the
egean
sea
contrary
winds
drove
him
from
his
course
to
the
sea
of
egypt
and
after
that
since
the
blasts
did
not
cease
to
blow
he
came
to
egypt
itself
and
in
egypt
to
that
which
is
now
named
the
canobic
mouth
of
the
nile
and
to
taricheiai
now
there
was
upon
the
shore
as
still
there
is
now
a
temple
of
heracles
in
which
if
any
man
slave
take
refuge
and
have
the
sacred
marks
set
upon
him
giving
himself
over
to
the
god
it
is
not
lawful
to
lay
hands
upon
him
and
this
custom
has
continued
still
unchanged
from
the
beginning
down
to
my
own
time
accordingly
the
attendants
of
alexander
having
heard
of
the
custom
which
existed
about
the
temple
ran
away
from
him
and
sitting
down
as
suppliants
of
the
god
accused
alexander
because
they
desired
to
do
him
hurt
telling
the
whole
tale
how
things
were
about
helen
and
about
the
wrong
done
to
menelaos
and
this
accusation
they
made
not
only
to
the
priests
but
also
to
the
warden
of
this
whose
name
was
thonis
thonis
then
having
heard
their
tale
sent
forthwith
a
message
to
proteus
at
memphis
which
said
as
follows
there
hath
come
a
stranger
a
teucrian
by
race
who
hath
done
in
hellas
an
unholy
deed
for
he
hath
deceived
the
wife
of
his
own
host
and
is
come
hither
bringing
with
him
this
woman
herself
and
very
much
wealth
having
been
carried
out
of
his
way
by
winds
to
thy
land
shall
we
then
allow
him
to
sail
out
unharmed
or
shall
we
first
take
away
from
him
that
which
he
brought
with
him
in
reply
to
this
proteus
sent
back
a
messenger
who
said
thus
seize
this
man
whosoever
he
may
be
who
has
done
impiety
to
his
own
host
and
bring
him
away
into
my
presence
that
i
may
know
what
he
will
find
to
say
hearing
this
thonis
seized
alexander
and
detained
his
ships
and
after
that
he
brought
the
man
himself
up
to
memphis
and
with
him
helen
and
the
wealth
he
had
and
also
in
addition
to
them
the
suppliants
so
when
all
had
been
conveyed
up
thither
proteus
began
to
ask
alexander
who
he
was
and
from
whence
he
was
voyaging
and
he
both
recounted
to
him
his
descent
and
told
him
the
name
of
his
native
land
and
moreover
related
of
his
voyage
from
whence
he
was
sailing
after
this
proteus
asked
him
whence
he
had
taken
helen
and
when
alexander
went
astray
in
his
account
and
did
not
speak
the
truth
those
who
had
become
suppliants
convicted
him
of
falsehood
relating
in
full
the
whole
tale
of
the
wrong
done
at
length
proteus
declared
to
them
this
sentence
saying
were
it
not
that
i
count
it
a
matter
of
great
moment
not
to
slay
any
of
those
strangers
who
being
driven
from
their
course
by
winds
have
come
to
my
land
hitherto
i
should
have
taken
vengeance
on
thee
on
behalf
of
the
man
of
hellas
seeing
that
thou
most
base
of
men
having
received
from
him
hospitality
didst
work
against
him
a
most
impious
deed
for
thou
didst
go
in
to
the
wife
of
thine
own
host
and
even
this
was
not
enough
for
thee
but
thou
didst
stir
her
up
with
desire
and
hast
gone
away
with
her
like
a
thief
moreover
not
even
this
by
itself
was
enough
for
thee
but
thou
art
come
hither
with
plunder
taken
from
the
house
of
thy
host
now
therefore
depart
seeing
that
i
have
counted
it
of
great
moment
not
to
be
a
slayer
of
strangers
this
woman
indeed
and
the
wealth
which
thou
hast
i
will
not
allow
thee
to
carry
away
but
i
shall
keep
them
safe
for
the
hellene
who
was
thy
host
until
he
come
himself
and
desire
to
carry
them
off
to
his
home
to
thyself
however
and
thy
i
proclaim
that
ye
depart
from
your
anchoring
within
three
days
and
go
from
my
land
to
some
other
and
if
not
that
ye
will
be
dealt
with
as
enemies
this
the
priests
said
was
the
manner
of
helen
coming
to
proteus
and
i
suppose
that
homer
also
had
heard
this
story
but
since
it
was
not
so
suitable
to
the
composition
of
his
poem
as
the
other
which
he
followed
he
dismissed
it
finally
making
it
clear
at
the
same
time
that
he
was
acquainted
with
that
story
also
and
according
to
the
manner
in
which
he
described
the
wanderings
of
alexander
in
the
iliad
nor
did
he
elsewhere
retract
that
which
he
had
said
it
is
clear
that
when
he
brought
helen
he
was
carried
out
of
his
course
wandering
to
various
lands
and
that
he
came
among
other
places
to
sidon
in
phenicia
of
this
the
poet
has
made
mention
in
the
prowess
of
diomede
and
the
verses
run
this
there
she
had
robes
the
works
of
women
of
sidon
those
whom
her
son
himself
the
of
form
alexander
carried
from
sidon
what
time
the
broad
he
sailed
over
bringing
back
helene
home
of
a
noble
father
begotten
and
in
the
odyssey
also
he
has
made
mention
of
it
in
these
verses
such
had
the
daughter
of
zeus
such
drugs
of
exquisite
cunning
good
which
to
her
the
wife
of
thon
polydamna
had
given
dwelling
in
egypt
the
land
where
the
bountiful
meadow
produces
drugs
more
than
all
lands
else
many
good
being
mixed
many
evil
and
thus
too
menelaos
says
to
telemachos
still
the
gods
stayed
me
in
egypt
to
come
back
hither
desiring
stayed
me
from
voyaging
home
since
sacrifice
was
due
i
performed
not
in
these
lines
he
makes
it
clear
that
he
knew
of
the
wandering
of
alexander
to
egypt
for
syria
borders
upon
egypt
and
the
phenicians
of
whom
is
sidon
dwell
in
syria
by
these
lines
and
by
this
passage
it
is
also
most
clearly
shown
that
the
cyprian
epic
was
not
written
by
homer
but
by
some
other
man
for
in
this
it
is
said
that
on
the
third
day
after
leaving
sparta
alexander
came
to
ilion
bringing
with
him
helen
having
had
a
wind
and
a
smooth
sea
whereas
in
the
iliad
it
says
that
he
wandered
from
his
course
when
he
brought
her
let
us
now
leave
homer
and
the
cyprian
epic
but
this
i
will
say
namely
that
i
asked
the
priests
whether
it
is
but
an
idle
tale
which
the
hellenes
tell
of
that
which
they
say
happened
about
ilion
and
they
answered
me
thus
saying
that
they
had
their
knowledge
by
inquiries
from
menelaos
himself
after
the
rape
of
helen
there
came
indeed
they
said
to
the
teucrian
land
a
large
army
of
hellenes
to
help
menelaos
and
when
the
army
had
come
out
of
the
ships
to
land
and
had
pitched
its
camp
there
they
sent
messengers
to
ilion
with
whom
went
also
menelaos
himself
and
when
these
entered
within
the
wall
they
demanded
back
helen
and
the
wealth
which
alexander
had
stolen
from
menelaos
and
had
taken
away
and
moreover
they
demanded
satisfaction
for
the
wrongs
done
and
the
teucrians
told
the
same
tale
then
and
afterwards
both
with
oath
and
without
oath
namely
that
in
deed
and
in
truth
they
had
not
helen
nor
the
wealth
for
which
demand
was
made
but
that
both
were
in
egypt
and
that
they
could
not
justly
be
compelled
to
give
satisfaction
for
that
which
proteus
the
king
of
egypt
had
the
hellenes
however
thought
that
they
were
being
mocked
by
them
and
besieged
the
city
until
at
last
they
took
it
and
when
they
had
taken
the
wall
and
did
not
find
helen
but
heard
the
same
tale
as
before
then
they
believed
the
former
tale
and
sent
menelaos
himself
to
proteus
and
menelaos
having
come
to
egypt
and
having
sailed
up
to
memphis
told
the
truth
of
these
matters
and
not
only
found
great
entertainment
but
also
received
helen
unhurt
and
all
his
own
wealth
besides
then
however
after
he
had
been
thus
dealt
with
menelaos
showed
himself
ungrateful
to
the
egyptians
for
when
he
set
forth
to
sail
away
contrary
winds
detained
him
and
as
this
condition
of
things
lasted
long
he
devised
an
impious
deed
for
he
took
two
children
of
natives
and
made
sacrifice
of
them
after
this
when
it
was
known
that
he
had
done
so
he
became
abhorred
and
being
pursued
he
escaped
and
got
away
in
his
ships
to
libya
but
whither
he
went
besides
after
this
the
egyptians
were
not
able
to
tell
of
these
things
they
said
that
they
found
out
part
by
inquiries
and
the
rest
namely
that
which
happened
in
their
own
land
they
related
from
sure
and
certain
knowledge
thus
the
priests
of
the
egyptians
told
me
and
i
myself
also
agree
with
the
story
which
was
told
of
helen
adding
this
consideration
namely
that
if
helen
had
been
in
ilion
she
would
have
been
given
up
to
the
hellenes
whether
alexander
consented
or
no
for
priam
assuredly
was
not
so
mad
nor
yet
the
others
of
his
house
that
they
were
desirous
to
run
risk
of
ruin
for
themselves
and
their
children
and
their
city
in
order
that
alexander
might
have
helen
as
his
wife
and
even
supposing
that
during
the
first
part
of
the
time
they
had
been
so
inclined
yet
when
many
others
of
the
trojans
besides
were
losing
their
lives
as
often
as
they
fought
with
the
hellenes
and
of
the
sons
of
priam
himself
always
two
or
three
or
even
more
were
slain
when
a
battle
took
place
if
one
may
trust
at
all
to
the
epic
poets
i
say
things
were
coming
thus
to
pass
i
consider
that
even
if
priam
himself
had
had
helen
as
his
wife
he
would
have
given
her
back
to
the
achaians
if
at
least
by
so
doing
he
might
be
freed
from
the
evils
which
oppressed
him
nor
even
was
the
kingdom
coming
to
alexander
next
so
that
when
priam
was
old
the
government
was
in
his
hands
but
hector
who
was
both
older
and
more
of
a
man
than
he
would
have
received
it
after
the
death
of
priam
and
him
it
behoved
not
to
allow
his
brother
to
go
on
with
his
considering
that
great
evils
were
coming
to
pass
on
his
account
both
to
himself
privately
and
in
general
to
the
other
trojans
in
truth
however
they
lacked
the
power
to
give
helen
back
and
the
hellenes
did
not
believe
them
though
they
spoke
the
truth
because
as
i
declare
my
opinion
the
divine
power
was
purposing
to
cause
them
utterly
to
perish
and
so
make
it
evident
to
men
that
for
great
wrongs
great
also
are
the
chastisements
which
come
from
the
gods
and
thus
have
i
delivered
my
opinion
concerning
these
matters
after
proteus
they
told
me
rhampsinitos
received
in
succession
the
kingdom
who
left
as
a
memorial
of
himself
that
gateway
to
the
temple
of
hephaistos
which
is
turned
towards
the
west
and
in
front
of
the
gateway
he
set
up
two
statues
in
height
cubits
of
which
the
one
which
stands
on
the
north
side
is
called
by
the
egyptians
summer
and
the
one
on
the
south
side
winter
and
to
that
one
which
they
call
summer
they
do
reverence
and
make
offerings
while
to
the
other
which
is
called
winter
they
do
the
opposite
of
these
things
a
this
king
they
said
got
great
wealth
of
silver
which
none
of
the
kings
born
after
him
could
surpass
or
even
come
near
to
and
wishing
to
store
his
wealth
in
safety
he
caused
to
be
built
a
chamber
of
stone
one
of
the
walls
whereof
was
towards
the
outside
of
his
palace
and
the
builder
of
this
having
a
design
against
it
contrived
as
follows
that
is
he
disposed
one
of
the
stones
in
such
a
manner
that
it
could
be
taken
out
easily
from
the
wall
either
by
two
men
or
even
by
one
so
when
the
chamber
was
finished
the
king
stored
his
money
in
it
and
after
some
time
the
builder
being
near
the
end
of
his
life
called
to
him
his
sons
for
he
had
two
and
to
them
he
related
how
he
had
contrived
in
building
the
treasury
of
the
king
and
all
in
forethought
for
them
that
they
might
have
ample
means
of
living
and
when
he
had
clearly
set
forth
to
them
everything
concerning
the
taking
out
of
the
stone
he
gave
them
the
measurements
saying
that
if
they
paid
heed
to
this
matter
they
would
be
stewards
of
the
king
treasury
so
he
ended
his
life
and
his
sons
made
no
long
delay
in
setting
to
work
but
went
to
the
palace
by
night
and
having
found
the
stone
in
the
wall
of
the
chamber
they
dealt
with
it
easily
and
carried
forth
for
themselves
great
quantity
of
the
wealth
within
b
and
the
king
happening
to
open
the
chamber
he
marvelled
when
he
saw
the
vessels
falling
short
of
the
full
amount
and
he
did
not
know
on
whom
he
should
lay
the
blame
since
the
seals
were
unbroken
and
the
chamber
had
been
close
shut
but
when
upon
his
opening
the
chamber
a
second
and
a
third
time
the
money
was
each
time
seen
to
be
diminished
for
the
thieves
did
not
slacken
in
their
assaults
upon
it
he
did
as
follows
ordered
traps
to
be
made
he
set
these
round
about
the
vessels
in
which
the
money
was
and
when
the
thieves
had
come
as
at
former
times
and
one
of
them
had
entered
then
so
soon
as
he
came
near
to
one
of
the
vessels
he
was
straightway
caught
in
the
trap
and
when
he
perceived
in
what
evil
case
he
was
straightway
calling
his
brother
he
showed
him
what
the
matter
was
and
bade
him
enter
as
quickly
as
possible
and
cut
off
his
head
for
fear
lest
being
seen
and
known
he
might
bring
about
the
destruction
of
his
brother
also
and
to
the
other
it
seemed
that
he
spoke
well
and
he
was
persuaded
and
did
so
and
fitting
the
stone
into
its
place
he
departed
home
bearing
with
him
the
head
of
his
brother
c
now
when
it
became
day
the
king
entered
into
the
chamber
and
was
very
greatly
amazed
seeing
the
body
of
the
thief
held
in
the
trap
without
his
head
and
the
chamber
unbroken
with
no
way
to
come
in
or
go
out
and
being
at
a
loss
he
hung
up
the
dead
body
of
the
thief
upon
the
wall
and
set
guards
there
with
charge
if
they
saw
any
one
weeping
or
bewailing
himself
to
seize
him
and
bring
him
before
the
king
and
when
the
dead
body
had
been
hung
up
the
mother
was
greatly
grieved
and
speaking
with
the
son
who
survived
she
enjoined
him
in
whatever
way
he
could
to
contrive
means
by
which
he
might
take
down
and
bring
home
the
body
of
his
dead
brother
and
if
he
should
neglect
to
do
this
she
earnestly
threatened
that
she
would
go
and
give
information
to
the
king
that
he
had
the
money
d
so
as
the
mother
dealt
hardly
with
the
surviving
son
and
he
though
saying
many
things
to
her
did
not
persuade
her
he
contrived
for
his
purpose
a
device
as
follows
himself
with
asses
he
filled
some
skins
with
wine
and
laid
them
upon
the
asses
and
after
that
he
drove
them
along
and
when
he
came
opposite
to
those
who
were
guarding
the
corpse
hung
up
he
drew
towards
him
two
or
three
of
the
necks
of
the
skins
and
loosened
the
cords
with
which
they
were
tied
then
when
the
wine
was
running
out
he
began
to
beat
his
head
and
cry
out
loudly
as
if
he
did
not
know
to
which
of
the
asses
he
should
first
turn
and
when
the
guards
saw
the
wine
flowing
out
in
streams
they
ran
together
to
the
road
with
drinking
vessels
in
their
hands
and
collected
the
wine
that
was
poured
out
counting
it
so
much
gain
and
he
abused
them
all
violently
making
as
if
he
were
angry
but
when
the
guards
tried
to
appease
him
after
a
time
he
feigned
to
be
pacified
and
to
abate
his
anger
and
at
length
he
drove
his
asses
out
of
the
road
and
began
to
set
their
loads
right
then
more
talk
arose
among
them
and
one
or
two
of
them
made
jests
at
him
and
brought
him
to
laugh
with
them
and
in
the
end
he
made
them
a
present
of
one
of
the
skins
in
addition
to
what
they
had
upon
that
they
lay
down
there
without
more
ado
being
minded
to
drink
and
they
took
him
into
their
company
and
invited
him
to
remain
with
them
and
join
them
in
their
drinking
so
he
as
may
be
supposed
was
persuaded
and
stayed
then
as
they
in
their
drinking
bade
him
welcome
in
a
friendly
manner
he
made
a
present
to
them
also
of
another
of
the
skins
and
so
at
length
having
drunk
liberally
the
guards
became
completely
intoxicated
and
being
overcome
by
sleep
they
went
to
bed
on
the
spot
where
they
had
been
drinking
he
then
as
it
was
now
far
on
in
the
night
first
took
down
the
body
of
his
brother
and
then
in
mockery
shaved
the
right
cheeks
of
all
the
guards
and
after
that
he
put
the
dead
body
upon
the
asses
and
drove
them
away
home
having
accomplished
that
which
was
enjoined
him
by
his
mother
e
upon
this
the
king
when
it
was
reported
to
him
that
the
dead
body
of
the
thief
had
been
stolen
away
displayed
great
anger
and
desiring
by
all
means
that
it
should
be
found
out
who
it
might
be
who
devised
these
things
did
this
so
at
least
they
said
but
i
do
not
believe
the
account
caused
his
own
daughter
to
sit
in
the
stews
and
enjoined
her
to
receive
all
equally
and
before
having
commerce
with
any
one
to
compel
him
to
tell
her
what
was
the
most
cunning
and
what
the
most
unholy
deed
which
had
been
done
by
him
in
all
his
and
whosoever
should
relate
that
which
had
happened
about
the
thief
him
she
must
seize
and
not
let
him
go
out
then
as
she
was
doing
that
which
was
enjoined
by
her
father
the
thief
hearing
for
what
purpose
this
was
done
and
having
a
desire
to
get
the
better
of
the
king
in
resource
did
thus
the
body
of
one
lately
dead
he
cut
off
the
arm
at
the
shoulder
and
went
with
it
under
his
mantle
and
having
gone
in
to
the
daughter
of
the
king
and
being
asked
that
which
the
others
also
were
asked
he
related
that
he
had
done
the
most
unholy
deed
when
he
cut
off
the
head
of
his
brother
who
had
been
caught
in
a
trap
in
the
and
the
most
cunning
deed
in
that
he
made
drunk
the
guards
and
took
down
the
dead
body
of
his
brother
hanging
up
and
she
when
she
heard
it
tried
to
take
hold
of
him
but
the
thief
held
out
to
her
in
the
darkness
the
arm
of
the
corpse
which
she
grasped
and
held
thinking
that
she
was
holding
the
arm
of
the
man
himself
but
the
thief
left
it
in
her
hands
and
departed
escaping
through
the
door
f
now
when
this
also
was
reported
to
the
king
he
was
at
first
amazed
at
the
ready
invention
and
daring
of
the
fellow
and
then
afterwards
he
sent
round
to
all
the
cities
and
made
proclamation
granting
a
free
pardon
to
the
thief
and
also
promising
a
great
reward
if
he
would
come
into
his
presence
the
thief
accordingly
trusting
to
the
proclamation
came
to
the
king
and
rhampsinitos
greatly
marvelled
at
him
and
gave
him
this
daughter
of
his
to
wife
counting
him
to
be
the
most
knowing
of
all
men
for
as
the
egyptians
were
distinguished
from
all
other
men
so
was
he
from
the
other
egyptians
after
these
things
they
said
this
king
went
down
alive
to
that
place
which
by
the
hellenes
is
called
hades
and
there
played
at
dice
with
demeter
and
in
some
throws
he
overcame
her
and
in
others
he
was
overcome
by
her
and
he
came
back
again
having
as
a
gift
from
her
a
handkerchief
of
gold
and
they
told
me
that
because
of
the
going
down
of
rhampsinitos
the
egyptians
after
he
came
back
celebrated
a
feast
which
i
know
of
my
own
knowledge
also
that
they
still
observe
even
to
my
time
but
whether
it
is
for
this
cause
that
they
keep
the
feast
or
for
some
other
i
am
not
able
to
say
however
the
priests
weave
a
robe
completely
on
the
very
day
of
the
feast
and
forthwith
they
bind
up
the
eyes
of
one
of
them
with
a
fillet
and
having
led
him
with
the
robe
to
the
way
by
which
one
goes
to
the
temple
of
demeter
they
depart
back
again
themselves
this
priest
they
say
with
his
eyes
bound
up
is
led
by
two
wolves
to
the
temple
of
demeter
which
is
distant
from
the
city
twenty
furlongs
and
then
afterwards
the
wolves
lead
him
back
again
from
the
temple
to
the
same
spot
now
as
to
the
tales
told
by
the
egyptians
any
man
may
accept
them
to
whom
such
things
appear
credible
as
for
me
it
is
to
be
understood
throughout
the
whole
of
the
history
that
i
write
by
hearsay
that
which
is
reported
by
the
people
in
each
place
the
egyptians
say
that
demeter
and
dionysos
are
rulers
of
the
world
below
and
the
egyptians
are
also
the
first
who
reported
the
doctrine
that
the
soul
of
man
is
immortal
and
that
when
the
body
dies
the
soul
enters
into
another
creature
which
chances
then
to
be
coming
to
the
birth
and
when
it
has
gone
the
round
of
all
the
creatures
of
land
and
sea
and
of
the
air
it
enters
again
into
a
human
body
as
it
comes
to
the
birth
and
that
it
makes
this
round
in
a
period
of
three
thousand
years
this
doctrine
certain
hellenes
adopted
some
earlier
and
some
later
as
if
it
were
of
their
own
invention
and
of
these
men
i
know
the
names
but
i
abstain
from
recording
them
down
to
the
time
when
rhampsinitos
was
king
they
told
me
there
was
in
egypt
nothing
but
orderly
rule
and
egypt
prospered
greatly
but
after
him
cheops
became
king
over
them
and
brought
them
to
every
kind
of
evil
for
he
shut
up
all
the
temples
and
having
first
kept
them
from
sacrificing
there
he
then
bade
all
the
egyptians
work
for
him
so
some
were
appointed
to
draw
stones
from
the
in
the
arabian
mountains
to
the
nile
and
others
he
ordered
to
receive
the
stones
after
they
had
been
carried
over
the
river
in
boats
and
to
draw
them
to
those
which
are
called
the
libyan
mountains
and
they
worked
by
a
hundred
thousand
men
at
a
time
for
each
three
months
continually
of
this
oppression
there
passed
ten
years
while
the
causeway
was
made
by
which
they
drew
the
stones
which
causeway
they
built
and
it
is
a
work
not
much
less
as
it
appears
to
me
than
the
pyramid
for
the
length
of
it
is
five
furlongs
and
the
breadth
ten
fathoms
and
the
height
where
it
is
highest
eight
fathoms
and
it
is
made
of
stone
smoothed
and
with
figures
carved
upon
it
for
this
they
said
the
ten
years
were
spent
and
for
the
underground
chambers
on
the
hill
upon
which
the
pyramids
stand
which
he
caused
to
be
made
as
sepulchral
chambers
for
himself
in
an
island
having
conducted
thither
a
channel
from
the
nile
for
the
making
of
the
pyramid
itself
there
passed
a
period
of
twenty
years
and
the
pyramid
is
square
each
side
measuring
eight
hundred
feet
and
the
height
of
it
is
the
same
it
is
built
of
stone
smoothed
and
fitted
together
in
the
most
perfect
manner
not
one
of
the
stones
being
less
than
thirty
feet
in
length
this
pyramid
was
made
after
the
manner
of
steps
which
some
call
rows
and
others
bases
and
when
they
had
first
made
it
thus
they
raised
the
remaining
stones
with
machines
made
of
short
pieces
of
timber
raising
them
first
from
the
ground
to
the
first
stage
of
the
steps
and
when
the
stone
got
up
to
this
it
was
placed
upon
another
machine
standing
on
the
first
stage
and
so
from
this
it
was
drawn
to
the
second
upon
another
machine
for
as
many
as
were
the
courses
of
the
steps
so
many
machines
there
were
also
or
perhaps
they
transferred
one
and
the
same
machine
made
so
as
easily
to
be
carried
to
each
stage
successively
in
order
that
they
might
take
up
the
stones
for
let
it
be
told
in
both
ways
according
as
it
is
reported
however
that
may
be
the
highest
parts
of
it
were
finished
first
and
afterwards
they
proceeded
to
finish
that
which
came
next
to
them
and
lastly
they
finished
the
parts
of
it
near
the
ground
and
the
lowest
ranges
on
the
pyramid
it
is
declared
in
egyptian
writing
how
much
was
spent
on
radishes
and
onions
and
leeks
for
the
workmen
and
if
i
rightly
remember
that
which
the
interpreter
said
in
reading
to
me
this
inscription
a
sum
of
one
thousand
six
hundred
talents
of
silver
was
spent
and
if
this
is
so
how
much
besides
is
likely
to
have
been
expended
upon
the
iron
with
which
they
worked
and
upon
bread
and
clothing
for
the
workmen
seeing
that
they
were
building
the
works
for
the
time
which
has
been
mentioned
and
were
occupied
for
no
small
time
besides
as
i
suppose
in
the
cutting
and
bringing
of
the
stones
and
in
working
at
the
excavation
under
the
ground
cheops
moreover
came
they
said
to
such
a
pitch
of
wickedness
that
being
in
want
of
money
he
caused
his
own
daughter
to
sit
in
the
stews
and
ordered
her
to
obtain
from
those
who
came
a
certain
amount
of
money
how
much
it
was
they
did
not
tell
me
but
she
not
only
obtained
the
sum
appointed
by
her
father
but
also
she
formed
a
design
for
herself
privately
to
leave
behind
her
a
memorial
and
she
requested
each
man
who
came
in
to
her
to
give
her
one
stone
upon
her
building
and
of
these
stones
they
told
me
the
pyramid
was
built
which
stands
in
front
of
the
great
pyramid
in
the
middle
of
the
three
each
side
being
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
in
length
this
cheops
the
egyptians
said
reigned
fifty
years
and
after
he
was
dead
his
brother
chephren
succeeded
to
the
kingdom
this
king
followed
the
same
manner
as
the
other
both
in
all
the
rest
and
also
in
that
he
made
a
pyramid
not
indeed
attaining
to
the
measurements
of
that
which
was
built
by
the
former
this
i
know
having
myself
also
measured
it
and
moreover
there
are
no
underground
chambers
beneath
nor
does
a
channel
come
from
the
nile
flowing
to
this
one
as
to
the
other
in
which
the
water
coming
through
a
conduit
built
for
it
flows
round
an
island
within
where
they
say
that
cheops
himself
is
laid
but
for
a
basement
he
built
the
first
course
of
ethiopian
stone
of
divers
colours
and
this
pyramid
he
made
forty
feet
lower
than
the
other
as
regards
size
building
it
close
to
the
great
pyramid
these
stand
both
upon
the
same
hill
which
is
about
a
hundred
feet
high
and
chephren
they
said
reigned
fifty
and
six
years
here
then
they
reckon
one
hundred
and
six
years
during
which
they
say
that
there
was
nothing
but
evil
for
the
egyptians
and
the
temples
were
kept
closed
and
not
opened
during
all
that
time
these
kings
the
egyptians
by
reason
of
their
hatred
of
them
are
not
very
willing
to
name
nay
they
even
call
the
pyramids
after
the
name
of
philitis
the
shepherd
who
at
that
time
pastured
flocks
in
those
regions
after
him
they
said
mykerinos
became
king
over
egypt
who
was
the
son
of
cheops
and
to
him
his
father
deeds
were
displeasing
and
he
both
opened
the
temples
and
gave
liberty
to
the
people
who
were
ground
down
to
the
last
extremity
of
evil
to
return
to
their
own
business
and
to
their
sacrifices
also
he
gave
decisions
of
their
causes
juster
than
those
of
all
the
other
kings
besides
in
regard
to
this
then
they
commend
this
king
more
than
all
the
other
kings
who
had
arisen
in
egypt
before
him
for
he
not
only
gave
good
decisions
but
also
when
a
man
complained
of
the
decision
he
gave
him
recompense
from
his
own
goods
and
thus
satisfied
his
desire
but
while
mykerinos
was
acting
mercifully
to
his
subjects
and
practising
this
conduct
which
has
been
said
calamities
befell
him
of
which
the
first
was
this
namely
that
his
daughter
died
the
only
child
whom
he
had
in
his
house
and
being
above
measure
grieved
by
that
which
had
befallen
him
and
desiring
to
bury
his
daughter
in
a
manner
more
remarkable
than
others
he
made
a
cow
of
wood
which
he
covered
over
with
gold
and
then
within
it
he
buried
this
daughter
who
as
i
said
had
died
this
cow
was
not
covered
up
in
the
ground
but
it
might
be
seen
even
down
to
my
own
time
in
the
city
of
saïs
placed
within
the
royal
palace
in
a
chamber
which
was
greatly
adorned
and
they
offer
incense
of
all
kinds
before
it
every
day
and
each
night
a
lamp
burns
beside
it
all
through
the
night
near
this
cow
in
another
chamber
stand
images
of
the
concubines
of
mykerinos
as
the
priests
at
saïs
told
me
for
there
are
in
fact
colossal
wooden
statues
in
number
about
twenty
made
with
naked
bodies
but
who
they
are
i
am
not
able
to
say
except
only
that
which
is
reported
some
however
tell
about
this
cow
and
the
colossal
statues
the
following
tale
namely
that
mykerinos
was
enamoured
of
his
own
daughter
and
afterwards
ravished
her
and
upon
this
they
say
that
the
girl
strangled
herself
for
grief
and
he
buried
her
in
this
cow
and
her
mother
cut
off
the
hands
of
the
maids
who
had
betrayed
the
daughter
to
her
father
wherefore
now
the
images
of
them
have
suffered
that
which
the
maids
suffered
in
their
life
in
thus
saying
they
speak
idly
as
it
seems
to
me
especially
in
what
they
say
about
the
hands
of
the
statues
for
as
to
this
even
we
ourselves
saw
that
their
hands
had
dropped
off
from
lapse
of
time
and
they
were
to
be
seen
still
lying
at
their
feet
even
down
to
my
time
the
cow
is
covered
up
with
a
crimson
robe
except
only
the
head
and
the
neck
which
are
seen
overlaid
with
gold
very
thickly
and
between
the
horns
there
is
the
disc
of
the
sun
figured
in
gold
the
cow
is
not
standing
up
but
kneeling
and
in
size
it
is
equal
to
a
large
living
cow
every
year
it
is
carried
forth
from
the
chamber
at
those
times
i
say
the
egyptians
beat
themselves
for
that
god
whom
i
will
not
name
upon
occasion
of
such
a
matter
at
these
times
i
say
they
also
carry
forth
the
cow
to
the
light
of
day
for
they
say
that
she
asked
of
her
father
mykerinos
when
she
was
dying
that
she
might
look
upon
the
sun
once
in
the
year
after
the
misfortune
of
his
daughter
it
happened
they
said
secondly
to
this
king
as
follows
oracle
came
to
him
from
the
city
of
buto
saying
that
he
was
destined
to
live
but
six
years
more
in
the
seventh
year
to
end
his
life
and
he
being
indignant
at
it
sent
to
the
oracle
a
reproach
against
the
god
making
complaint
in
reply
that
whereas
his
father
and
uncle
who
had
shut
up
the
temples
and
had
not
only
not
remembered
the
gods
but
also
had
been
destroyers
of
men
had
lived
for
a
long
time
he
himself
who
practised
piety
was
destined
to
end
his
life
so
soon
and
from
the
oracle
there
came
a
second
message
which
said
that
it
was
for
this
very
cause
that
he
was
bringing
his
life
to
a
swift
close
for
he
had
not
done
that
which
it
was
appointed
for
him
to
do
since
it
was
destined
that
egypt
should
suffer
evils
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
and
the
two
kings
who
had
risen
before
him
had
perceived
this
but
he
had
not
mykerinos
having
heard
this
and
considering
that
this
sentence
had
been
passed
upon
him
beyond
recall
procured
many
lamps
and
whenever
night
came
on
he
lighted
these
and
began
to
drink
and
take
his
pleasure
ceasing
neither
by
day
nor
by
night
and
he
went
about
to
the
and
to
the
woods
and
wherever
he
heard
there
were
the
most
suitable
places
for
enjoyment
this
he
devised
having
a
mind
to
prove
that
the
oracle
spoke
falsely
in
order
that
he
might
have
twelve
years
of
life
instead
of
six
the
nights
being
turned
into
days
this
king
also
left
behind
him
a
pyramid
much
smaller
than
that
of
his
father
of
a
square
shape
and
measuring
on
each
side
three
hundred
feet
lacking
twenty
built
moreover
of
ethiopian
stone
up
to
half
the
height
this
pyramid
some
of
the
hellenes
say
was
built
by
the
courtesan
rhodopis
not
therein
speaking
rightly
and
besides
this
it
is
evident
to
me
that
they
who
speak
thus
do
not
even
know
who
rhodopis
was
for
otherwise
they
would
not
have
attributed
to
her
the
building
of
a
pyramid
like
this
on
which
have
been
spent
so
to
speak
innumerable
thousands
of
talents
moreover
they
do
not
know
that
rhodopis
flourished
in
the
reign
of
amasis
and
not
in
this
king
reign
for
rhodopis
lived
very
many
years
later
than
the
kings
who
left
behind
the
pyramids
by
descent
she
was
of
thrace
and
she
was
a
slave
of
iadmon
the
son
of
hephaistopolis
a
samian
and
a
of
esop
the
maker
of
fables
for
he
too
was
once
the
slave
of
iadmon
as
was
proved
especially
in
this
fact
namely
that
when
the
people
of
delphi
repeatedly
made
proclamation
in
accordance
with
an
oracle
to
find
some
one
who
would
take
up
the
for
the
death
of
esop
no
one
else
appeared
but
at
length
the
grandson
of
iadmon
called
iadmon
also
took
it
up
and
thus
it
is
shown
that
esop
too
was
the
slave
of
iadmon
as
for
rhodopis
she
came
to
egypt
brought
by
xanthes
the
samian
and
having
come
thither
to
exercise
her
calling
she
was
redeemed
from
slavery
for
a
great
sum
by
a
man
of
mytilene
charaxos
son
of
scamandronymos
and
brother
of
sappho
the
lyric
poet
thus
was
rhodopis
set
free
and
she
remained
in
egypt
and
by
her
beauty
won
so
much
liking
that
she
made
great
gain
of
money
for
one
like
rhodopis
though
not
enough
to
suffice
for
the
cost
of
such
a
pyramid
as
this
in
truth
there
is
no
need
to
ascribe
to
her
very
great
riches
considering
that
the
tithe
of
her
wealth
may
still
be
seen
even
to
this
time
by
any
one
who
desires
it
for
rhodopis
wished
to
leave
behind
her
a
memorial
of
herself
in
hellas
namely
to
cause
a
thing
to
be
made
such
as
happens
not
to
have
been
thought
of
or
dedicated
in
a
temple
by
any
besides
and
to
dedicate
this
at
delphi
as
a
memorial
of
herself
accordingly
with
the
tithe
of
her
wealth
she
caused
to
be
made
spits
of
iron
of
size
large
enough
to
pierce
a
whole
ox
and
many
in
number
going
as
far
therein
as
her
tithe
allowed
her
and
she
sent
them
to
delphi
these
are
even
at
the
present
time
lying
there
heaped
all
together
behind
the
altar
which
the
chians
dedicated
and
just
opposite
to
the
cell
of
the
temple
now
at
naucratis
as
it
happens
the
courtesans
are
rather
apt
to
win
credit
for
this
woman
first
about
whom
the
story
to
which
i
refer
is
told
became
so
famous
that
all
the
hellenes
without
exception
come
to
know
the
name
of
rhodopis
and
then
after
her
one
whose
name
was
archidiche
became
a
subject
of
song
over
all
hellas
though
she
was
less
talked
of
than
the
other
as
for
charaxos
when
after
redeeming
rhodopis
he
returned
back
to
mytilene
sappho
in
an
ode
violently
abused
him
of
rhodopis
then
i
shall
say
no
more
after
mykerinos
the
priests
said
asychis
became
king
of
egypt
and
he
made
for
hephaistos
the
temple
gateway
which
is
towards
the
sunrising
by
far
the
most
beautiful
and
the
largest
of
the
gateways
for
while
they
all
have
figures
carved
upon
them
and
innumerable
ornaments
of
building
besides
this
has
them
very
much
more
than
the
rest
in
this
king
reign
they
told
me
that
as
the
circulation
of
money
was
very
slow
a
law
was
made
for
the
egyptians
that
a
man
might
have
that
money
lent
to
him
which
he
needed
by
offering
as
security
the
dead
body
of
his
father
and
there
was
added
moreover
to
this
law
another
namely
that
he
who
lent
the
money
should
have
a
claim
also
to
the
whole
sepulchral
chamber
belonging
to
him
who
received
it
and
that
the
man
who
offered
that
security
should
be
subject
to
this
penalty
if
he
refused
to
pay
back
the
debt
namely
that
neither
the
man
himself
should
be
allowed
to
have
burial
when
he
died
either
in
that
family
or
in
any
other
nor
should
he
be
allowed
to
bury
any
one
of
his
kinsmen
whom
he
lost
by
death
this
king
desiring
to
surpass
the
kings
of
egypt
who
had
arisen
before
him
left
as
a
memorial
of
himself
a
pyramid
which
he
made
of
bricks
and
on
it
there
is
an
inscription
carved
in
stone
and
saying
thus
despise
not
me
in
comparison
with
the
pyramids
of
stone
seeing
that
i
excel
them
as
much
as
zeus
excels
the
other
gods
for
with
a
pole
they
struck
into
the
lake
and
whatever
of
the
mud
attached
itself
to
the
pole
this
they
gathered
up
and
made
bricks
and
in
such
manner
they
finished
me
such
were
the
deeds
which
this
king
performed
and
after
him
reigned
a
blind
man
of
the
city
of
anysis
whose
name
was
anysis
in
his
reign
the
ethiopians
and
sabacos
the
king
of
the
ethiopians
marched
upon
egypt
with
a
great
host
of
men
so
this
blind
man
departed
flying
to
the
and
the
ethiopian
was
king
over
egypt
for
fifty
years
during
which
he
performed
deeds
as
follows
any
man
of
the
egyptians
committed
any
transgression
he
would
never
put
him
to
death
but
he
gave
sentence
upon
each
man
according
to
the
greatness
of
the
appointing
them
work
at
throwing
up
an
embankment
before
that
city
from
whence
each
man
came
of
those
who
committed
wrong
thus
the
cities
were
made
higher
still
than
before
for
they
were
embanked
first
by
those
who
dug
the
channels
in
the
reign
of
sesostris
and
then
secondly
in
the
reign
of
the
ethiopian
and
thus
they
were
made
very
high
and
while
other
cities
in
egypt
also
stood
high
i
think
in
the
town
at
bubastis
especially
the
earth
was
piled
up
in
this
city
there
is
a
temple
very
well
worthy
of
mention
for
though
there
are
other
temples
which
are
larger
and
built
with
more
cost
none
more
than
this
is
a
pleasure
to
the
eyes
now
bubastis
in
the
hellenic
tongue
is
artemis
and
her
temple
is
ordered
thus
the
entrance
it
is
completely
surrounded
by
water
for
channels
come
in
from
the
nile
not
joining
one
another
but
each
extending
as
far
as
the
entrance
of
the
temple
one
flowing
round
on
the
one
side
and
the
other
on
the
other
side
each
a
hundred
feet
broad
and
shaded
over
with
trees
and
the
gateway
has
a
height
of
ten
fathoms
and
it
is
adorned
with
figures
six
cubits
high
very
noteworthy
this
temple
is
in
the
middle
of
the
city
and
is
looked
down
upon
from
all
sides
as
one
goes
round
for
since
the
city
has
been
banked
up
to
a
height
while
the
temple
has
not
been
moved
from
the
place
where
it
was
at
the
first
built
it
is
possible
to
look
down
into
it
and
round
it
runs
a
stone
wall
with
figures
carved
upon
it
while
within
it
there
is
a
grove
of
very
large
trees
planted
round
a
large
within
which
is
the
image
of
the
goddess
and
the
breadth
and
length
of
the
temple
is
a
furlong
every
way
opposite
the
entrance
there
is
a
road
paved
with
stone
for
about
three
furlongs
which
leads
through
the
towards
the
east
with
a
breadth
of
about
four
hundred
feet
and
on
this
side
and
on
that
grow
trees
of
height
reaching
to
heaven
and
the
road
leads
to
the
temple
of
hermes
this
temple
then
is
thus
ordered
the
final
deliverance
from
the
ethiopian
came
about
they
said
as
follows
fled
away
because
he
had
seen
in
his
sleep
a
vision
in
which
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
man
came
and
stood
by
him
and
counselled
him
to
gather
together
all
the
priests
of
egypt
and
cut
them
asunder
in
the
midst
having
seen
this
dream
he
said
that
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
gods
were
foreshowing
him
this
to
furnish
an
occasion
against
him
in
order
that
he
might
do
an
impious
deed
with
respect
to
religion
and
so
receive
some
evil
either
from
the
gods
or
from
men
he
would
not
however
do
so
but
in
truth
he
said
the
time
had
expired
during
which
it
had
been
prophesied
to
him
that
he
should
rule
egypt
before
he
departed
thence
for
when
he
was
in
ethiopia
the
oracles
which
the
ethiopians
consult
had
told
him
that
it
was
fated
for
him
to
rule
egypt
fifty
years
since
then
this
time
was
now
expiring
and
the
vision
of
the
dream
also
disturbed
him
sabacos
departed
out
of
egypt
of
his
own
free
will
then
when
the
ethiopian
had
gone
away
out
of
egypt
the
blind
man
came
back
from
the
and
began
to
rule
again
having
lived
there
during
fifty
years
upon
an
island
which
he
had
made
by
heaping
up
ashes
and
earth
for
whenever
any
of
the
egyptians
visited
him
bringing
food
according
as
it
had
been
appointed
to
them
severally
to
do
without
the
knowledge
of
the
ethiopian
he
bade
them
bring
also
some
ashes
for
their
gift
this
island
none
was
able
to
find
before
amyrtaios
that
is
for
more
than
seven
hundred
years
the
kings
who
arose
before
amyrtaios
were
not
able
to
find
it
now
the
name
of
this
island
is
elbo
and
its
size
is
ten
furlongs
each
way
after
him
there
came
to
the
throne
the
priest
of
hephaistos
whose
name
was
sethos
this
man
they
said
neglected
and
held
in
no
regard
the
warrior
class
of
the
egyptians
considering
that
he
would
have
no
need
of
them
and
besides
other
slights
which
he
put
upon
them
he
also
took
from
them
the
yokes
of
which
had
been
given
to
them
as
a
special
gift
in
the
reigns
of
the
former
kings
twelve
yokes
to
each
man
after
this
sanacharib
king
of
the
arabians
and
of
the
assyrians
marched
a
great
host
against
egypt
then
the
warriors
of
the
egyptians
refused
to
come
to
the
rescue
and
the
priest
being
driven
into
a
strait
entered
into
the
sanctuary
of
the
temple
and
bewailed
to
the
image
of
the
god
the
danger
which
was
impending
over
him
and
as
he
was
thus
lamenting
sleep
came
upon
him
and
it
seemed
to
him
in
his
vision
that
the
god
came
and
stood
by
him
and
encouraged
him
saying
that
he
should
suffer
no
evil
if
he
went
forth
to
meet
the
army
of
the
arabians
for
he
himself
would
send
him
helpers
trusting
in
these
things
seen
in
sleep
he
took
with
him
they
said
those
of
the
egyptians
who
were
willing
to
follow
him
and
encamped
in
pelusion
for
by
this
way
the
invasion
came
and
not
one
of
the
warrior
class
followed
him
but
and
artisans
and
men
of
the
market
then
after
they
came
there
swarmed
by
night
upon
their
enemies
mice
of
the
fields
and
ate
up
their
quivers
and
their
bows
and
moreover
the
handles
of
their
shields
so
that
on
the
next
day
they
fled
and
being
without
defence
of
arms
great
numbers
fell
and
at
the
present
time
this
king
stands
in
the
temple
of
hephaistos
in
stone
holding
upon
his
hand
a
mouse
and
by
letters
inscribed
he
says
these
words
let
him
who
looks
upon
me
learn
to
fear
the
gods
so
far
in
the
story
the
egyptians
and
the
priests
were
they
who
made
the
report
declaring
that
from
the
first
king
down
to
this
priest
of
hephaistos
who
reigned
last
there
had
been
three
hundred
and
generations
of
men
and
that
in
them
there
had
been
the
same
number
of
and
of
kings
but
three
hundred
generations
of
men
are
equal
to
ten
thousand
years
for
a
hundred
years
is
three
generations
of
men
and
in
the
generations
which
remain
those
i
mean
which
were
added
to
the
three
hundred
there
are
one
thousand
three
hundred
and
forty
years
thus
in
the
period
of
eleven
thousand
three
hundred
and
forty
years
they
said
that
there
had
arisen
no
god
in
human
form
nor
even
before
that
time
or
afterwards
among
the
remaining
kings
who
arose
in
egypt
did
they
report
that
anything
of
that
kind
had
come
to
pass
in
this
time
they
said
that
the
sun
had
moved
four
times
from
his
accustomed
place
of
rising
and
where
he
now
sets
he
had
thence
twice
had
his
rising
and
in
the
place
from
whence
he
now
rises
he
had
twice
had
his
setting
and
in
the
meantime
nothing
in
egypt
had
been
changed
from
its
usual
state
neither
that
which
comes
from
the
earth
nor
that
which
comes
to
them
from
the
river
nor
that
which
concerns
diseases
or
deaths
and
formerly
when
hecataios
the
historian
was
in
thebes
and
had
traced
his
descent
and
connected
his
family
with
a
god
in
the
sixteenth
generation
before
the
priests
of
zeus
did
for
him
much
the
same
as
they
did
for
me
though
i
had
not
traced
my
descent
they
led
me
into
the
sanctuary
of
the
temple
which
is
of
great
size
and
they
counted
up
the
number
showing
colossal
wooden
statues
in
number
the
same
as
they
said
for
each
there
sets
up
in
his
lifetime
an
image
of
himself
accordingly
the
priests
counting
and
showing
me
these
declared
to
me
that
each
one
of
them
was
a
son
succeeding
his
own
father
and
they
went
up
through
the
series
of
images
from
the
image
of
the
one
who
had
died
last
until
they
had
declared
this
of
the
whole
number
and
when
hecataios
had
traced
his
descent
and
connected
his
family
with
a
god
in
the
sixteenth
generation
they
traced
a
descent
in
opposition
to
this
besides
their
numbering
not
accepting
it
from
him
that
a
man
had
been
born
from
a
god
and
they
traced
their
thus
saying
that
each
one
of
the
statues
had
been
piromis
son
of
piromis
until
they
had
declared
this
of
the
whole
three
hundred
and
statues
each
one
being
surnamed
piromis
and
neither
with
a
god
nor
a
hero
did
they
connect
their
descent
now
piromis
means
in
the
tongue
of
hellas
honourable
and
good
man
from
their
declaration
then
it
followed
that
they
of
whom
the
images
were
had
been
of
form
like
this
and
far
removed
from
being
gods
but
in
the
time
before
these
men
they
said
that
gods
were
the
rulers
in
egypt
not
mingling
with
men
and
that
of
these
always
one
had
power
at
a
time
and
the
last
of
them
who
was
king
over
egypt
was
oros
the
son
of
osiris
whom
the
hellenes
call
apollo
he
was
king
over
egypt
last
having
deposed
typhon
now
osiris
in
the
tongue
of
hellas
is
dionysos
among
the
hellenes
heracles
and
dionysos
and
pan
are
accounted
the
of
the
gods
but
with
the
egyptians
pan
is
a
very
ancient
god
and
he
is
one
of
those
which
are
called
the
eight
gods
while
heracles
is
of
the
second
rank
who
are
called
the
twelve
gods
and
dionysos
is
of
the
third
rank
namely
of
those
who
were
born
of
the
twelve
gods
now
as
to
heracles
i
have
shown
already
how
many
years
old
he
is
according
to
the
egyptians
themselves
reckoning
down
to
the
reign
of
amasis
and
pan
is
said
to
have
existed
for
yet
more
years
than
these
and
dionysos
for
the
smallest
number
of
years
as
compared
with
the
others
and
even
for
this
last
they
reckon
down
to
the
reign
of
amasis
fifteen
thousand
years
this
the
egyptians
say
that
they
know
for
a
certainty
since
they
always
kept
a
reckoning
and
wrote
down
the
years
as
they
came
now
the
dionysos
who
is
said
to
have
been
born
of
semele
the
daughter
of
cadmos
was
born
about
sixteen
hundred
years
before
my
time
and
heracles
who
was
the
son
of
alcmene
about
nine
hundred
years
and
that
pan
who
was
born
of
penelope
for
of
her
and
of
hermes
pan
is
said
by
the
hellenes
to
have
been
born
came
into
being
later
than
the
wars
of
troy
about
eight
hundred
years
before
my
time
of
these
two
accounts
every
man
may
adopt
that
one
which
he
shall
find
the
more
credible
when
he
hears
it
i
however
for
my
part
have
already
declared
my
opinion
about
them
for
if
these
also
like
heracles
the
son
of
amphitryon
had
appeared
before
all
men
eyes
and
had
lived
their
lives
to
old
age
in
hellas
i
mean
dionysos
the
son
of
semele
and
pan
the
son
of
penelope
then
one
would
have
said
that
these
also
had
been
born
mere
men
having
the
names
of
those
gods
who
had
come
into
being
long
before
but
as
it
is
with
regard
to
dionysos
the
hellenes
say
that
as
soon
as
he
was
born
zeus
sewed
him
up
in
his
thigh
and
carried
him
to
nysa
which
is
above
egypt
in
the
land
of
ethiopia
and
as
to
pan
they
can
not
say
whither
he
went
after
he
was
born
hence
it
has
become
clear
to
me
that
the
hellenes
learnt
the
names
of
these
gods
later
than
those
of
the
other
gods
and
trace
their
descent
as
if
their
birth
occurred
at
the
time
when
they
first
learnt
their
names
thus
far
then
the
history
is
told
by
the
egyptians
themselves
but
i
will
now
recount
that
which
other
nations
also
tell
and
the
egyptians
in
agreement
with
the
others
of
that
which
happened
in
this
land
and
there
will
be
added
to
this
also
something
of
that
which
i
have
myself
seen
being
set
free
after
the
reign
of
the
priest
of
hephaistos
the
egyptians
since
they
could
not
live
any
time
without
a
king
set
up
over
them
twelve
kings
having
divided
all
egypt
into
twelve
parts
these
made
intermarriages
with
one
another
and
reigned
making
agreement
that
they
would
not
put
down
one
another
by
force
nor
seek
to
get
an
advantage
over
one
another
but
would
live
in
perfect
friendship
and
the
reason
why
they
made
these
agreements
guarding
them
very
strongly
from
violation
was
this
namely
that
an
oracle
had
been
given
to
them
at
first
when
they
began
to
exercise
their
rule
that
he
of
them
who
should
pour
a
libation
with
a
bronze
cup
in
the
temple
of
hephaistos
should
be
king
of
all
egypt
for
they
used
to
assemble
together
in
all
the
temples
moreover
they
resolved
to
join
all
together
and
leave
a
memorial
of
themselves
and
having
so
resolved
they
caused
to
be
made
a
labyrinth
situated
a
little
above
the
lake
of
moiris
and
nearly
opposite
to
that
which
is
called
the
city
of
crocodiles
this
i
saw
myself
and
i
found
it
greater
than
words
can
say
for
if
one
should
put
together
and
reckon
up
all
the
buildings
and
all
the
great
works
produced
by
the
hellenes
they
would
prove
to
be
inferior
in
labour
and
expense
to
this
labyrinth
though
it
is
true
that
both
the
temple
at
ephesos
and
that
at
samos
are
works
worthy
of
note
the
pyramids
also
were
greater
than
words
can
say
and
each
one
of
them
is
equal
to
many
works
of
the
hellenes
great
as
they
may
be
but
the
labyrinth
surpasses
even
the
pyramids
it
has
twelve
courts
covered
in
with
gates
facing
one
another
six
upon
the
north
side
and
six
upon
the
south
joining
on
one
to
another
and
the
same
wall
surrounds
them
all
outside
and
there
are
in
it
two
kinds
of
chambers
the
one
kind
below
the
ground
and
the
other
above
upon
these
three
thousand
in
number
of
each
kind
fifteen
hundred
the
upper
set
of
chambers
we
ourselves
saw
going
through
them
and
we
tell
of
them
having
looked
upon
them
with
our
own
eyes
but
the
chambers
under
ground
we
heard
about
only
for
the
egyptians
who
had
charge
of
them
were
not
willing
on
any
account
to
show
them
saying
that
here
were
the
sepulchres
of
the
kings
who
had
first
built
this
labyrinth
and
of
the
sacred
crocodiles
accordingly
we
speak
of
the
chambers
below
by
what
we
received
from
hearsay
while
those
above
we
saw
ourselves
and
found
them
to
be
works
of
more
than
human
greatness
for
the
passages
through
the
chambers
and
the
goings
this
way
and
that
way
through
the
courts
which
were
admirably
adorned
afforded
endless
matter
for
marvel
as
we
went
through
from
a
court
to
the
chambers
beyond
it
and
from
the
chambers
to
colonnades
and
from
the
colonnades
to
other
rooms
and
then
from
the
chambers
again
to
other
courts
over
the
whole
of
these
is
a
roof
made
of
stone
like
the
walls
and
the
walls
are
covered
with
figures
carved
upon
them
each
court
being
surrounded
with
pillars
of
white
stone
fitted
together
most
perfectly
and
at
the
end
of
the
labyrinth
by
the
corner
of
it
there
is
a
pyramid
of
forty
fathoms
upon
which
large
figures
are
carved
and
to
this
there
is
a
way
made
under
ground
such
is
this
labyrinth
but
a
cause
for
marvel
even
greater
than
this
is
afforded
by
the
lake
which
is
called
the
lake
of
moiris
along
the
side
of
which
this
labyrinth
is
built
the
measure
of
its
circuit
is
three
thousand
six
hundred
furlongs
being
sixty
schoines
and
this
is
the
same
number
of
furlongs
as
the
extent
of
egypt
itself
along
the
sea
the
lake
lies
extended
lengthwise
from
north
to
south
and
in
depth
where
it
is
deepest
it
is
fifty
fathoms
that
this
lake
is
artificial
and
formed
by
digging
is
for
about
in
the
middle
of
the
lake
stand
two
pyramids
each
rising
above
the
water
to
a
height
of
fifty
fathoms
the
part
which
is
built
below
the
water
being
of
just
the
same
height
and
upon
each
is
placed
a
colossal
statue
of
stone
sitting
upon
a
chair
thus
the
pyramids
are
a
hundred
fathoms
high
and
these
hundred
fathoms
are
equal
to
a
furlong
of
six
hundred
feet
the
fathom
being
measured
as
six
feet
or
four
cubits
the
feet
being
four
palms
each
and
the
cubits
six
the
water
in
the
lake
does
not
come
from
the
place
where
it
is
for
the
country
there
is
very
deficient
in
water
but
it
has
been
brought
thither
from
the
nile
by
a
canal
and
for
six
months
the
water
flows
into
the
lake
and
for
six
months
out
into
the
nile
again
and
whenever
it
flows
out
then
for
the
six
months
it
brings
into
the
royal
treasury
a
talent
of
silver
a
day
from
the
fish
which
are
caught
and
twenty
pounds
when
the
water
comes
in
the
natives
of
the
place
moreover
said
that
this
lake
had
an
outlet
under
ground
to
the
syrtis
which
is
in
libya
turning
towards
the
interior
of
the
continent
upon
the
western
side
and
running
along
by
the
mountain
which
is
above
memphis
now
since
i
did
not
see
anywhere
existing
the
earth
dug
out
of
this
excavation
for
that
was
a
matter
which
drew
my
attention
i
asked
those
who
dwelt
nearest
to
the
lake
where
the
earth
was
which
had
been
dug
out
these
told
me
to
what
place
it
had
been
carried
away
and
i
readily
believed
them
for
i
knew
by
report
that
a
similar
thing
had
been
done
at
nineveh
the
city
of
the
assyrians
there
certain
thieves
formed
a
design
once
to
carry
away
the
wealth
of
sardanapallos
son
of
ninos
the
king
which
wealth
was
very
great
and
was
kept
in
under
the
earth
accordingly
they
began
from
their
own
dwelling
and
making
estimate
of
their
direction
they
dug
under
ground
towards
the
king
palace
and
the
earth
which
was
brought
out
of
the
excavation
they
used
to
carry
away
when
night
came
on
to
the
river
tigris
which
flows
by
the
city
of
nineveh
until
at
last
they
accomplished
that
which
they
desired
similarly
as
i
heard
the
digging
of
the
lake
in
egypt
was
effected
except
that
it
was
done
not
by
night
but
during
the
day
for
as
they
dug
the
egyptians
carried
to
the
nile
the
earth
which
was
dug
out
and
the
river
when
it
received
it
would
naturally
bear
it
away
and
disperse
it
thus
is
this
lake
said
to
have
been
dug
out
now
the
twelve
kings
continued
to
rule
justly
but
in
course
of
time
it
happened
thus
sacrifice
in
the
temple
of
hephaistos
they
were
about
to
make
libation
on
the
last
day
of
the
feast
and
the
in
bringing
out
for
them
the
golden
cups
with
which
they
had
been
wont
to
pour
libations
missed
his
reckoning
and
brought
eleven
only
for
the
twelve
kings
then
that
one
of
them
who
was
standing
last
in
order
namely
psammetichos
since
he
had
no
cup
took
off
from
his
head
his
helmet
which
was
of
bronze
and
having
held
it
out
to
receive
the
wine
he
proceeded
to
make
libation
likewise
all
the
other
kings
were
wont
to
wear
helmets
and
they
happened
to
have
them
then
now
psammetichos
held
out
his
helmet
with
no
treacherous
meaning
but
they
taking
note
of
that
which
had
been
done
by
psammetichos
and
of
the
oracle
namely
how
it
had
been
declared
to
them
that
whosoever
of
them
should
make
libation
with
a
bronze
cup
should
be
sole
king
of
egypt
recollecting
i
say
the
saying
of
the
oracle
they
did
not
indeed
deem
it
right
to
slay
psammetichos
since
they
found
by
examination
that
he
had
not
done
it
with
any
forethought
but
they
determined
to
strip
him
of
almost
all
his
power
and
to
drive
him
away
into
the
and
that
from
the
he
should
not
hold
any
dealings
with
the
rest
of
egypt
this
psammetichos
had
formerly
been
a
fugitive
from
the
ethiopian
sabacos
who
had
killed
his
father
necos
from
him
i
say
he
had
then
been
a
fugitive
in
syria
and
when
the
ethiopian
had
departed
in
consequence
of
the
vision
of
the
dream
the
egyptians
who
were
of
the
district
of
saïs
brought
him
back
to
his
own
country
then
afterwards
when
he
was
king
it
was
his
fate
to
be
a
fugitive
a
second
time
on
account
of
the
helmet
being
driven
by
the
eleven
kings
into
the
so
then
holding
that
he
had
been
grievously
wronged
by
them
he
thought
how
he
might
take
vengeance
on
those
who
had
driven
him
out
and
when
he
had
sent
to
the
oracle
of
leto
in
the
city
of
buto
where
the
egyptians
have
their
most
truthful
oracle
there
was
given
to
him
the
reply
that
vengeance
would
come
when
men
of
bronze
appeared
from
the
sea
and
he
was
strongly
disposed
not
to
believe
that
bronze
men
would
come
to
help
him
but
after
no
long
time
had
passed
certain
ionians
and
carians
who
had
sailed
forth
for
plunder
were
compelled
to
come
to
shore
in
egypt
and
they
having
landed
and
being
clad
in
bronze
armour
one
of
the
egyptians
not
having
before
seen
men
clad
in
bronze
armour
came
to
the
and
brought
a
report
to
psammetichos
that
bronze
men
had
come
from
the
sea
and
were
plundering
the
plain
so
he
perceiving
that
the
saying
of
the
oracle
was
coming
to
pass
dealt
in
a
friendly
manner
with
the
ionians
and
carians
and
with
large
promises
he
persuaded
them
to
take
his
part
then
when
he
had
persuaded
them
with
the
help
of
those
egyptians
who
favoured
his
cause
and
of
these
foreign
mercenaries
he
overthrew
the
kings
having
thus
got
power
over
all
egypt
psammetichos
made
for
hephaistos
that
gateway
of
the
temple
at
memphis
which
is
turned
towards
the
south
wind
and
he
built
a
court
for
apis
in
which
apis
is
kept
when
he
appears
opposite
to
the
gateway
of
the
temple
surrounded
all
with
pillars
and
covered
with
figures
and
instead
of
columns
there
stand
to
support
the
roof
of
the
court
colossal
statues
twelve
cubits
high
now
apis
is
in
the
tongue
of
the
hellenes
epaphos
to
the
ionians
and
to
the
carians
who
had
helped
him
psammetichos
granted
portions
of
land
to
dwell
in
opposite
to
one
another
with
the
river
nile
between
and
these
were
called
encampments
these
portions
of
land
he
gave
them
and
he
paid
them
besides
all
that
he
had
promised
moreover
he
placed
with
them
egyptian
boys
to
have
them
taught
the
hellenic
tongue
and
from
these
who
learnt
the
language
thoroughly
are
descended
the
present
class
of
interpreters
in
egypt
now
the
ionians
and
carians
occupied
these
portions
of
land
for
a
long
time
and
they
are
towards
the
sea
a
little
below
the
city
of
bubastis
on
that
which
is
called
the
pelusian
mouth
of
the
nile
these
men
king
amasis
afterwards
removed
from
thence
and
established
them
at
memphis
making
them
into
a
guard
for
himself
against
the
egyptians
and
they
being
settled
in
egypt
we
who
are
hellenes
know
by
intercourse
with
them
the
certainty
of
all
that
which
happened
in
egypt
beginning
from
king
psammetichos
and
afterwards
for
these
were
the
first
men
of
foreign
tongue
who
settled
in
egypt
and
in
the
land
from
which
they
were
removed
there
still
remained
down
to
my
time
the
sheds
where
their
ships
were
drawn
up
and
the
ruins
of
their
houses
thus
then
psammetichos
obtained
egypt
and
of
the
oracle
which
is
in
egypt
i
have
made
mention
often
before
this
and
now
i
will
give
an
account
of
it
seeing
that
it
is
worthy
to
be
described
this
oracle
which
is
in
egypt
is
sacred
to
leto
and
it
is
established
in
a
great
city
near
that
mouth
of
the
nile
which
is
called
sebennytic
as
one
sails
up
the
river
from
the
sea
and
the
name
of
this
city
where
the
oracle
is
found
is
buto
as
i
have
said
before
in
mentioning
it
in
this
buto
there
is
a
temple
of
apollo
and
artemis
and
the
of
leto
in
which
the
oracle
is
is
both
great
in
itself
and
has
a
gateway
of
the
height
of
ten
fathoms
but
that
which
caused
me
most
to
marvel
of
the
things
to
be
seen
there
i
will
now
tell
there
is
in
this
sacred
enclosure
a
house
of
leto
made
of
one
single
stone
as
regards
both
height
and
length
and
of
which
all
the
walls
are
in
these
two
directions
equal
each
being
forty
cubits
and
for
the
covering
in
of
the
roof
there
lies
another
stone
upon
the
top
the
cornice
measuring
four
cubits
this
house
then
of
all
the
things
that
were
to
be
seen
by
me
in
that
temple
is
the
most
marvellous
and
among
those
which
come
next
is
the
island
called
chemmis
this
is
situated
in
a
deep
and
broad
lake
by
the
side
of
the
temple
at
buto
and
it
is
said
by
the
egyptians
that
this
island
is
a
floating
island
i
myself
did
not
see
it
either
floating
about
or
moved
from
its
place
and
i
feel
surprise
at
hearing
of
it
wondering
if
it
be
indeed
a
floating
island
in
this
island
of
which
i
speak
there
is
a
great
of
apollo
and
three
several
altars
are
set
up
within
and
there
are
planted
in
the
island
many
and
other
trees
both
bearing
fruit
and
not
bearing
fruit
and
the
egyptians
when
they
say
that
it
is
floating
add
this
story
namely
that
in
this
island
which
formerly
was
not
floating
leto
being
one
of
the
eight
gods
who
came
into
existence
first
and
dwelling
in
the
city
of
buto
where
she
has
this
oracle
received
apollo
from
isis
as
a
charge
and
preserved
him
concealing
him
in
the
island
which
is
said
now
to
be
a
floating
island
at
that
time
when
typhon
came
after
him
seeking
everywhere
and
desiring
to
find
the
son
of
osiris
now
they
say
that
apollo
and
artemis
are
children
of
dionysos
and
of
isis
and
that
leto
became
their
nurse
and
preserver
and
in
the
egyptian
tongue
apollo
is
oros
demeter
is
isis
and
artemis
is
bubastis
from
this
story
and
from
no
other
æschylus
the
son
of
euphorion
took
this
which
i
shall
say
wherein
he
differs
from
all
the
preceding
poets
he
represented
namely
that
artemis
was
the
daughter
of
demeter
for
this
reason
then
they
say
it
became
a
floating
island
such
is
the
story
which
they
tell
but
as
for
psammetichos
he
was
king
over
egypt
for
years
of
which
for
thirty
years
save
one
he
was
sitting
before
azotos
a
great
city
of
syria
besieging
it
until
at
last
he
took
it
and
this
azotos
of
all
cities
about
which
we
have
knowledge
held
out
for
the
longest
time
under
a
siege
the
son
of
psammetichos
was
necos
and
he
became
king
of
egypt
this
man
was
the
first
who
attempted
the
channel
leading
to
the
erythraian
sea
which
dareios
the
persian
afterwards
completed
the
length
of
this
is
a
voyage
of
four
days
and
in
breadth
it
was
so
dug
that
two
triremes
could
go
side
by
side
driven
by
oars
and
the
water
is
brought
into
it
from
the
nile
the
channel
is
conducted
a
little
above
the
city
of
bubastis
by
patumos
the
arabian
city
and
runs
into
the
erythraian
sea
and
it
is
dug
first
along
those
parts
of
the
plain
of
egypt
which
lie
towards
arabia
just
above
which
run
the
mountains
which
extend
opposite
memphis
where
are
the
the
base
of
these
mountains
the
channel
is
conducted
from
west
to
east
for
a
great
way
and
after
that
it
is
directed
towards
a
break
in
the
hills
and
tends
from
these
mountains
towards
the
and
the
south
wind
to
the
arabian
gulf
now
in
the
place
where
the
journey
is
least
and
shortest
from
the
northern
to
the
southern
sea
which
is
also
called
erythraian
that
is
from
mount
casion
which
is
the
boundary
between
egypt
and
syria
the
distance
is
exactly
a
thousand
furlongs
to
the
arabian
gulf
but
the
channel
is
much
longer
since
it
is
more
winding
and
in
the
reign
of
necos
there
perished
while
digging
it
twelve
myriads
of
the
egyptians
now
necos
ceased
in
the
midst
of
his
digging
because
the
utterance
of
an
oracle
impeded
him
which
was
to
the
effect
that
he
was
working
for
the
barbarian
and
the
egyptians
call
all
men
barbarians
who
do
not
agree
with
them
in
speech
thus
having
ceased
from
the
work
of
the
channel
necos
betook
himself
to
waging
wars
and
triremes
were
built
by
him
some
for
the
northern
sea
and
others
in
the
arabian
gulf
for
the
erythraian
sea
and
of
these
the
sheds
are
still
to
be
seen
these
ships
he
used
when
he
needed
them
and
also
on
land
necos
engaged
battle
at
magdolos
with
the
syrians
and
conquered
them
and
after
this
he
took
cadytis
which
is
a
great
city
of
syria
and
the
dress
which
he
wore
when
he
made
these
conquests
he
dedicated
to
apollo
sending
it
to
branchidai
of
the
milesians
after
this
having
reigned
in
all
sixteen
years
he
brought
his
life
to
an
end
and
handed
on
the
kingdom
to
psammis
his
son
while
this
psammis
was
king
of
egypt
there
came
to
him
men
sent
by
the
eleians
who
boasted
that
they
ordered
the
contest
at
olympia
in
the
most
just
and
honourable
manner
possible
and
thought
that
not
even
the
egyptians
the
wisest
of
men
could
find
out
anything
besides
to
be
added
to
their
rules
now
when
the
eleians
came
to
egypt
and
said
that
for
which
they
had
come
then
this
king
called
together
those
of
the
egyptians
who
were
reputed
the
wisest
and
when
the
egyptians
had
come
together
they
heard
the
eleians
tell
of
all
that
which
it
was
their
part
to
do
in
regard
to
the
contest
and
when
they
had
related
everything
they
said
that
they
had
come
to
learn
in
addition
anything
which
the
egyptians
might
be
able
to
find
out
besides
which
was
juster
than
this
they
then
having
consulted
together
asked
the
eleians
whether
their
own
citizens
took
part
in
the
contest
and
they
said
that
it
was
permitted
to
any
one
who
desired
it
both
of
their
own
people
and
of
the
other
hellenes
equally
to
take
part
in
the
contest
upon
which
the
egyptians
said
that
in
so
ordering
the
games
they
had
wholly
missed
the
mark
of
justice
for
it
could
not
be
but
that
they
would
take
part
with
the
man
of
their
own
state
if
he
was
contending
and
so
act
unfairly
to
the
stranger
but
if
they
really
desired
as
they
said
to
order
the
games
justly
and
if
this
was
the
cause
for
which
they
had
come
to
egypt
they
advised
them
to
order
the
contest
so
as
to
be
for
strangers
alone
to
contend
in
and
that
no
eleian
should
be
permitted
to
contend
such
was
the
suggestion
made
by
the
egyptians
to
the
eleians
when
psammis
had
been
king
of
egypt
for
only
six
years
and
had
made
an
expedition
to
ethiopia
and
immediately
afterwards
had
ended
his
life
apries
the
son
of
psammis
received
the
kingdom
in
succession
this
man
came
to
be
the
most
prosperous
of
all
the
kings
up
to
that
time
except
only
his
forefather
psammetichos
and
he
reigned
years
during
which
he
led
an
army
against
sidon
and
fought
a
with
the
king
of
tyre
since
however
it
was
fated
that
evil
should
come
upon
him
it
came
by
occasion
of
a
matter
which
i
shall
relate
at
greater
length
in
the
libyan
history
and
at
present
but
shortly
apries
having
sent
a
great
expedition
against
the
kyrenians
met
with
correspondingly
great
disaster
and
the
egyptians
considering
him
to
blame
for
this
revolted
from
him
supposing
that
apries
had
with
forethought
sent
them
out
to
evident
calamity
in
order
as
they
said
that
there
might
be
a
slaughter
of
them
and
he
might
the
more
securely
rule
over
the
other
egyptians
being
indignant
at
this
both
these
men
who
had
returned
from
the
expedition
and
also
the
friends
of
those
who
had
perished
made
revolt
openly
hearing
this
apries
sent
to
them
amasis
to
cause
them
to
cease
by
persuasion
and
when
he
had
come
and
was
seeking
to
restrain
the
egyptians
as
he
was
speaking
and
telling
them
not
to
do
so
one
of
the
egyptians
stood
up
behind
him
and
put
a
helmet
upon
his
head
saying
as
he
did
so
that
he
put
it
on
to
crown
him
king
and
to
him
this
that
was
done
was
in
some
degree
not
unwelcome
as
he
proved
by
his
behaviour
for
as
soon
as
the
revolted
egyptians
had
set
him
up
as
king
he
prepared
to
march
against
apries
and
apries
hearing
this
sent
to
amasis
one
of
the
egyptians
who
were
about
his
own
person
a
man
of
reputation
whose
name
was
patarbemis
enjoining
him
to
bring
amasis
alive
into
his
presence
when
this
patarbemis
came
and
summoned
amasis
the
latter
who
happened
to
be
sitting
on
horseback
lifted
up
his
leg
and
behaved
in
an
unseemly
manner
bidding
him
take
that
back
to
apries
nevertheless
they
say
patarbemis
made
demand
of
him
that
he
should
go
to
the
king
seeing
that
the
king
had
sent
to
summon
him
and
he
answered
him
that
he
had
for
some
time
past
been
preparing
to
do
so
and
that
apries
would
have
no
occasion
to
find
fault
with
him
then
patarbemis
both
perceiving
his
intention
from
that
which
he
said
and
also
seeing
his
preparations
departed
in
haste
desiring
to
make
known
as
quickly
as
possible
to
the
king
the
things
which
were
being
done
and
when
he
came
back
to
apries
not
bringing
amasis
the
king
paying
no
regard
to
that
which
he
said
but
being
moved
by
violent
anger
ordered
his
ears
and
his
nose
to
be
cut
off
and
the
rest
of
the
egyptians
who
still
remained
on
his
side
when
they
saw
the
man
of
most
repute
among
them
thus
suffering
shameful
outrage
waited
no
longer
but
joined
the
others
in
revolt
and
delivered
themselves
over
to
amasis
then
apries
having
heard
this
also
armed
his
foreign
mercenaries
and
marched
against
the
egyptians
now
he
had
about
him
carian
and
ionian
mercenaries
to
the
number
of
thirty
thousand
and
his
royal
palace
was
in
the
city
of
saïs
of
great
size
and
worthy
to
be
seen
so
apries
and
his
army
were
going
against
the
egyptians
and
amasis
and
those
with
him
were
going
against
the
mercenaries
and
both
sides
came
to
the
city
of
momemphis
and
were
about
to
make
trial
of
one
another
in
fight
now
of
the
egyptians
there
are
seven
classes
and
of
these
one
class
is
called
that
of
the
priests
and
another
that
of
the
warriors
while
the
others
are
the
cowherds
swineherds
shopkeepers
interpreters
and
boatmen
this
is
the
number
of
the
classes
of
the
egyptians
and
their
names
are
given
them
from
the
occupations
which
they
follow
of
them
the
warriors
are
called
calasirians
and
hermotybians
and
they
are
of
the
following
districts
all
egypt
is
divided
into
districts
the
districts
of
the
hermotybians
are
those
of
busiris
saïs
chemmis
papremis
the
island
called
prosopitis
and
the
half
of
natho
these
districts
are
the
hermotybians
who
reached
when
most
numerous
the
number
of
sixteen
myriads
of
these
not
one
has
learnt
anything
of
handicraft
but
they
are
given
up
to
war
entirely
again
the
districts
of
the
calasirians
are
those
of
thebes
bubastis
aphthis
tanis
mendes
sebennytos
athribis
pharbaithos
thmuïs
onuphis
anytis
myecphoris
last
is
on
an
island
opposite
to
the
city
of
bubastis
these
are
the
districts
of
the
calasirians
and
they
reached
when
most
numerous
to
the
number
of
myriads
of
men
nor
is
it
lawful
for
these
any
more
than
for
the
others
to
practise
any
craft
but
they
practise
that
which
has
to
do
with
war
only
handing
down
the
tradition
from
father
to
son
now
whether
the
hellenes
have
learnt
this
also
from
the
egyptians
i
am
not
able
to
say
for
certain
since
i
see
that
the
thracians
also
and
scythians
and
persians
and
lydians
and
almost
all
the
barbarians
esteem
those
of
their
citizens
who
learn
the
arts
and
the
descendants
of
them
as
less
honourable
than
the
rest
while
those
who
have
got
free
from
all
practice
of
manual
arts
are
accounted
noble
and
especially
those
who
are
devoted
to
war
however
that
may
be
the
hellenes
have
all
learnt
this
and
especially
the
lacedemonians
but
the
corinthians
least
of
all
cast
slight
upon
those
who
practise
handicrafts
the
following
privilege
was
specially
granted
to
this
class
and
to
none
others
of
the
egyptians
except
the
priests
that
is
to
say
each
man
had
twelve
yokes
of
land
specially
granted
to
him
free
from
imposts
now
the
yoke
of
land
measures
a
hundred
egyptian
cubits
every
way
and
the
egyptian
cubit
is
as
it
happens
equal
to
that
of
samos
this
i
say
was
a
special
privilege
granted
to
all
and
they
also
had
certain
advantages
in
turn
and
not
the
same
men
twice
that
is
to
say
a
thousand
of
the
calasirians
and
a
thousand
of
the
hermotybians
acted
as
to
the
king
during
each
year
and
these
had
besides
their
yokes
of
land
an
allowance
given
them
for
each
day
of
five
pounds
weight
of
bread
to
each
man
and
two
pounds
of
beef
and
four
of
wine
this
was
the
allowance
given
to
those
who
were
serving
as
the
king
bodyguard
for
the
time
being
so
when
apries
leading
his
foreign
mercenaries
and
amasis
at
the
head
of
the
whole
body
of
the
egyptians
in
their
approach
to
one
another
had
come
to
the
city
of
momemphis
they
engaged
battle
and
although
the
foreign
troops
fought
well
yet
being
much
inferior
in
number
they
were
worsted
by
reason
of
this
but
apries
is
said
to
have
supposed
that
not
even
a
god
would
be
able
to
cause
him
to
cease
from
his
rule
so
firmly
did
he
think
that
it
was
established
in
that
battle
then
i
say
he
was
worsted
and
being
taken
alive
was
brought
away
to
the
city
of
saïs
to
that
which
had
formerly
been
his
own
dwelling
but
from
thenceforth
was
the
palace
of
amasis
there
for
some
time
he
was
kept
in
the
palace
and
amasis
dealt
well
with
him
but
at
last
since
the
egyptians
blamed
him
saying
that
he
acted
not
rightly
in
keeping
alive
him
who
was
the
greatest
foe
both
to
themselves
and
to
him
therefore
he
delivered
apries
over
to
the
egyptians
and
they
strangled
him
and
after
that
buried
him
in
the
of
his
fathers
this
is
in
the
temple
of
athene
close
to
the
sanctuary
on
the
left
hand
as
you
enter
now
the
men
of
saïs
buried
all
those
of
this
district
who
had
been
kings
within
the
temple
for
the
tomb
of
amasis
also
though
it
is
further
from
the
sanctuary
than
that
of
apries
and
his
forefathers
yet
this
too
is
within
the
court
of
the
temple
and
it
consists
of
a
colonnade
of
stone
of
great
size
with
pillars
carved
to
imitate
and
otherwise
sumptuously
adorned
and
within
the
colonnade
are
and
inside
the
doors
a
sepulchral
chamber
also
at
saïs
there
is
the
of
him
whom
i
account
it
not
pious
to
name
in
connexion
with
such
a
matter
which
is
in
the
temple
of
athene
behind
the
house
of
the
goddess
stretching
along
the
whole
wall
of
it
and
in
the
sacred
enclosure
stand
great
obelisks
of
stone
and
near
them
is
a
lake
adorned
with
an
edging
of
stone
and
fairly
made
in
a
circle
being
in
size
as
it
seemed
to
me
equal
to
that
which
is
called
the
round
pool
in
delos
on
this
lake
they
perform
by
night
the
show
of
his
sufferings
and
this
the
egyptians
call
mysteries
of
these
things
i
know
more
fully
in
detail
how
they
take
place
but
i
shall
leave
this
unspoken
and
of
the
mystic
rites
of
demeter
which
the
hellenes
call
thesmophoria
of
these
also
although
i
know
i
shall
leave
unspoken
all
except
so
much
as
piety
permits
me
to
tell
the
daughters
of
danaos
were
they
who
brought
this
rite
out
of
egypt
and
taught
it
to
the
women
of
the
pelasgians
then
afterwards
when
all
the
inhabitants
of
peloponnese
were
driven
out
by
the
dorians
the
rite
was
lost
and
only
those
who
were
left
behind
of
the
peloponnesians
and
not
driven
out
that
is
to
say
the
arcadians
preserved
it
apries
having
thus
been
overthrown
amasis
became
king
being
of
the
district
of
saïs
and
the
name
of
the
city
whence
he
was
is
siuph
now
at
the
first
the
egyptians
despised
amasis
and
held
him
in
no
great
regard
because
he
had
been
a
man
of
the
people
and
was
of
no
distinguished
family
but
afterwards
amasis
won
them
over
to
himself
by
wisdom
and
not
wilfulness
among
innumerable
other
things
of
price
which
he
had
there
was
a
of
gold
in
which
both
amasis
himself
and
all
his
guests
were
wont
always
to
wash
their
feet
this
he
broke
up
and
of
it
he
caused
to
be
made
the
image
of
a
god
and
set
it
up
in
the
city
where
it
was
most
convenient
and
the
egyptians
went
continually
to
visit
the
image
and
did
great
reverence
to
it
then
amasis
having
learnt
that
which
was
done
by
the
men
of
the
city
called
together
the
egyptians
and
made
known
to
them
the
matter
saying
that
the
image
had
been
produced
from
the
into
which
formerly
the
egyptians
used
to
vomit
and
make
water
and
in
which
they
washed
their
feet
whereas
now
they
did
to
it
great
reverence
and
just
so
he
continued
had
he
himself
now
fared
as
the
for
though
formerly
he
was
a
man
of
the
people
yet
now
he
was
their
king
and
he
bade
them
accordingly
honour
him
and
have
regard
for
him
in
such
manner
he
won
the
egyptians
to
himself
so
that
they
consented
to
be
his
subjects
and
his
ordering
of
affairs
was
thus
the
early
morning
and
until
the
time
of
the
filling
of
the
market
he
did
with
a
good
will
the
business
which
was
brought
before
him
but
after
this
he
passed
the
time
in
drinking
and
in
jesting
at
his
and
was
frivolous
and
playful
and
his
friends
being
troubled
at
it
admonished
him
in
some
such
words
as
these
o
king
thou
dost
not
rightly
govern
thyself
in
thus
letting
thyself
descend
to
behaviour
so
trifling
for
thou
oughtest
rather
to
have
been
sitting
throughout
the
day
stately
upon
a
stately
throne
and
administering
thy
business
and
so
the
egyptians
would
have
been
assured
that
they
were
ruled
by
a
great
man
and
thou
wouldest
have
had
a
better
report
but
as
it
is
thou
art
acting
by
no
means
in
a
kingly
fashion
and
he
answered
them
thus
they
who
have
bows
stretch
them
at
such
time
as
they
wish
to
use
them
and
when
they
have
finished
using
them
they
loose
them
again
for
if
they
were
stretched
tight
always
they
would
break
so
that
the
men
would
not
be
able
to
use
them
when
they
needed
them
so
also
is
the
state
of
man
if
he
should
always
be
in
earnest
and
not
relax
himself
for
sport
at
the
due
time
he
would
either
go
mad
or
be
struck
with
stupor
before
he
was
aware
and
knowing
this
well
i
distribute
a
portion
of
the
time
to
each
of
the
two
ways
of
living
thus
he
replied
to
his
friends
it
is
said
however
that
amasis
even
when
he
was
in
a
private
station
was
a
lover
of
drinking
and
of
jesting
and
not
at
all
seriously
disposed
and
whenever
his
means
of
livelihood
failed
him
through
his
drinking
and
luxurious
living
he
would
go
about
and
steal
and
they
from
whom
he
stole
would
charge
him
with
having
their
property
and
when
he
denied
it
would
bring
him
before
the
judgment
of
an
oracle
whenever
there
was
one
in
their
place
and
many
times
he
was
convicted
by
the
oracles
and
many
times
he
was
absolved
and
then
when
finally
he
became
king
he
did
as
follows
many
of
the
gods
as
had
absolved
him
and
pronounced
him
not
to
be
a
thief
to
their
temples
he
paid
no
regard
nor
gave
anything
for
the
further
adornment
of
them
nor
even
visited
them
to
offer
sacrifice
considering
them
to
be
worth
nothing
and
to
possess
lying
oracles
but
as
many
as
had
convicted
him
of
being
a
thief
to
these
he
paid
very
great
regard
considering
them
to
be
truly
gods
and
to
present
oracles
which
did
not
lie
first
in
saïs
he
built
and
completed
for
athene
a
which
is
a
great
marvel
and
he
far
surpassed
herein
all
who
had
done
the
like
before
both
in
regard
to
height
and
greatness
so
large
are
the
stones
and
of
such
quality
then
secondly
he
dedicated
great
colossal
statues
and
sphinxes
very
large
and
for
restoration
he
brought
other
stones
of
monstrous
size
some
of
these
he
caused
to
be
brought
from
the
which
are
opposite
memphis
others
of
very
great
size
from
the
city
of
elephantine
distant
a
voyage
of
not
less
than
twenty
days
from
saïs
and
of
them
all
i
marvel
most
at
this
namely
a
monolith
chamber
which
he
brought
from
the
city
of
elephantine
and
they
were
three
years
engaged
in
bringing
this
and
two
thousand
men
were
appointed
to
convey
it
who
all
were
of
the
class
of
boatmen
of
this
house
the
length
outside
is
cubits
the
breadth
is
fourteen
cubits
and
the
height
eight
these
are
the
measures
of
the
monolith
house
outside
but
the
length
inside
is
eighteen
cubits
and
of
a
cubit
the
breadth
twelve
cubits
and
the
height
five
cubits
this
lies
by
the
side
of
the
entrance
to
the
temple
for
within
the
temple
they
did
not
draw
it
because
as
it
said
while
the
house
was
being
drawn
along
the
chief
artificer
of
it
groaned
aloud
seeing
that
much
time
had
been
spent
and
he
was
wearied
by
the
work
and
amasis
took
it
to
heart
as
a
warning
and
did
not
allow
them
to
draw
it
further
onwards
some
say
on
the
other
hand
that
a
man
was
killed
by
it
of
those
who
were
heaving
it
with
levers
and
that
it
was
not
drawn
in
for
that
reason
amasis
also
dedicated
in
all
the
other
temples
which
were
of
repute
works
which
are
worth
seeing
for
their
size
and
among
them
also
at
memphis
the
colossal
statue
which
lies
on
its
back
in
front
of
the
temple
of
hephaistos
whose
length
is
feet
and
on
the
same
base
made
of
the
same
stone
are
set
two
colossal
statues
each
of
twenty
feet
in
length
one
on
this
side
and
the
other
on
that
side
of
the
large
statue
there
is
also
another
of
stone
of
the
same
size
in
saïs
lying
in
the
same
manner
as
that
at
memphis
moreover
amasis
was
he
who
built
and
finished
for
isis
her
temple
at
memphis
which
is
of
great
size
and
very
worthy
to
be
seen
in
the
reign
of
amasis
it
is
said
that
egypt
became
more
prosperous
than
at
any
other
time
before
both
in
regard
to
that
which
comes
to
the
land
from
the
river
and
in
regard
to
that
which
comes
from
the
land
to
its
inhabitants
and
that
at
this
time
the
inhabited
towns
in
it
numbered
in
all
twenty
thousand
it
was
amasis
too
who
established
the
law
that
every
year
each
one
of
the
egyptians
should
declare
to
the
ruler
of
his
district
from
what
source
he
got
his
livelihood
and
if
any
man
did
not
do
this
or
did
not
make
declaration
of
an
honest
way
of
living
he
should
be
punished
with
death
now
solon
the
athenian
received
from
egypt
this
law
and
had
it
enacted
for
the
athenians
and
they
have
continued
to
observe
it
since
it
is
a
law
with
which
none
can
find
fault
moreover
amasis
became
a
lover
of
the
hellenes
and
besides
other
proofs
of
friendship
which
he
gave
to
several
among
them
he
also
granted
the
city
of
naucratis
for
those
of
them
who
came
to
egypt
to
dwell
in
and
to
those
who
did
not
desire
to
stay
but
who
made
voyages
thither
he
granted
portions
of
land
to
set
up
altars
and
make
sacred
enclosures
for
their
gods
their
greatest
enclosure
and
that
one
which
has
most
name
and
is
most
frequented
is
called
the
hellenion
and
this
was
established
by
the
following
cities
in
common
the
ionians
chios
teos
phocaia
clazomenai
of
the
dorians
rhodes
cnidos
halicarnassos
phaselis
and
of
the
aiolians
mytilene
alone
to
these
belongs
this
enclosure
and
these
are
the
cities
which
appoint
superintendents
of
the
port
and
all
other
cities
which
claim
a
share
in
it
are
making
a
claim
without
any
right
besides
this
the
eginetans
established
on
their
own
account
a
sacred
enclosure
dedicated
to
zeus
the
samians
one
to
hera
and
the
milesians
one
to
apollo
now
in
old
times
naucratis
alone
was
an
open
and
no
other
place
in
egypt
and
if
any
one
came
to
any
other
of
the
nile
mouths
he
was
compelled
to
swear
that
he
came
not
thither
of
his
own
will
and
when
he
had
thus
sworn
his
innocence
he
had
to
sail
with
his
ship
to
the
canobic
mouth
or
if
it
were
not
possible
to
sail
by
reason
of
contrary
winds
then
he
had
to
carry
his
cargo
round
the
head
of
the
delta
in
boats
to
naucratis
thus
highly
was
naucratis
privileged
moreover
when
the
amphictyons
had
let
out
the
contract
for
building
the
temple
which
now
exists
at
delphi
agreeing
to
pay
a
sum
of
three
hundred
talents
for
the
temple
which
formerly
stood
there
had
been
burnt
down
of
itself
it
fell
to
the
share
of
the
people
of
delphi
to
provide
the
fourth
part
of
the
payment
and
accordingly
the
delphians
went
about
to
various
cities
and
collected
contributions
and
when
they
did
this
they
got
from
egypt
as
much
as
from
any
place
for
amasis
gave
them
a
thousand
talents
weight
of
alum
while
the
hellenes
who
dwelt
in
egypt
gave
them
twenty
pounds
of
silver
also
with
the
people
of
kyrene
amasis
made
an
agreement
for
friendship
and
alliance
and
he
resolved
too
to
marry
a
wife
from
thence
whether
because
he
desired
to
have
a
wife
of
hellenic
race
or
apart
from
that
on
account
of
friendship
for
the
people
of
kyrene
however
that
may
be
he
married
some
say
the
daughter
of
battos
others
of
arkesilaos
and
others
of
critobulos
a
man
of
repute
among
the
citizens
and
her
name
was
ladike
now
whenever
amasis
lay
with
her
he
found
himself
unable
to
have
intercourse
but
with
his
other
wives
he
associated
as
he
was
wont
and
as
this
happened
repeatedly
amasis
said
to
his
wife
whose
name
was
ladike
woman
thou
hast
given
me
drugs
and
thou
shalt
surely
perish
more
miserably
than
any
other
woman
then
ladike
when
by
her
denials
amasis
was
not
at
all
appeased
in
his
anger
against
her
made
a
vow
in
her
soul
to
aphrodite
that
if
amasis
on
that
night
had
intercourse
with
her
seeing
that
this
was
the
remedy
for
her
danger
she
would
send
an
image
to
be
dedicated
to
her
at
kyrene
and
after
the
vow
immediately
amasis
had
intercourse
and
from
thenceforth
whenever
amasis
came
in
to
her
he
had
intercourse
with
her
and
after
this
he
became
very
greatly
attached
to
her
and
ladike
paid
the
vow
that
she
had
made
to
the
goddess
for
she
had
an
image
made
and
sent
it
to
kyrene
and
it
was
still
preserved
even
to
my
own
time
standing
with
its
face
turned
away
from
the
city
of
the
kyrenians
this
ladike
cambyses
having
conquered
egypt
and
heard
from
her
who
she
was
sent
back
unharmed
to
kyrene
amasis
also
dedicated
offerings
in
hellas
first
at
kyrene
an
image
of
athene
covered
over
with
gold
and
a
figure
of
himself
made
like
by
painting
then
in
the
temple
of
athene
at
lindson
two
images
of
stone
and
a
corslet
of
linen
worthy
to
be
seen
and
also
at
samos
two
wooden
figures
of
himself
dedicated
to
hera
which
were
standing
even
to
my
own
time
in
the
great
temple
behind
the
doors
now
at
samos
he
dedicated
offerings
because
of
the
between
himself
and
polycrates
the
son
of
aiakes
at
lindos
for
no
but
because
the
temple
of

at

is
said
to
have
been
founded
by
the
daughters
of
danaos
who
had
touched
land
there
at
the
time
when
they
were
fleeing
from
the
sons
of
aigyptos
these
offerings
were
dedicated
by
amasis

he

of

who
conquered

one

the
meaning
seems
to
be
this
the
ionians
say
that
egypt
is
the
delta
and
at
the
same
time
they
divide
the
world
into
three
parts
europe
asia
and
libya
the
last
two
being
divided
from
one
another
by
the
nile
thus
they
have
left
out
egypt
altogether
and
either
they
must
add
the
delta
as
a
fourth
part
of
the
world
or
they
must
give
up
the
nile
as
a
boundary
if
the
name
egypt
be
extended
as
it
is
by
the
other
hellenes
to
the
upper
course
of
the
nile
it
is
then
possible
to
retain
the
nile
as
a
boundary
saying
that
half
of
egypt
belongs
to
asia
and
half
to
libya
and
disregarding
the
delta
ch
this
also
would
be
an
error
of
reckoning
but
less
serious
than
to
omit
egypt
together
the
reasoning
is
obscure
because
it
alludes
to
theories
of
hecataios

other

which
are
presumed
to
be

this
is
the
reading
of
all
the
best
and
also
fits
in
best
with
the
argument
which
was
that
in
egypt
gods
were
quite
distinct
from

most

however
read

on
the
authority
of

the
reading
of

ouk

not
oukeontas

stated

that
the

borrowed
these

all
the

mentioned
and
not
as
stein
contended
to

only
kai

as
well
as

but
it
may
mean
that
these
also
distinct
from
the
gods
had
been
born
etc
the
connexion
seems
to
be
this
i
expressed
my
opinion
on
all
these
cases
when
i
spoke
of
the
case
of
heracles
for
though
the
statement
there
about
heracles
was
in
one
respect
inapplicable
to
the
rest
yet
in
the
main
conclusion
that
gods
are
not
born
of
men
it
applies
to
all
stadioi

of
which
go

i
understand
that
each

consisted
of

which

dimensions

and
length
therefore
it
was
made
of
a
single
stone
that
it
should
have
been
a
monolith
except
the
roof
is
almost
impossible
not
only
because
of
the
size
mentioned
which
in
any
case
is
suspicious
but
because
no
one
would
so
hollow
out
a
monolith
that
it
would
be
necessary
afterwards
to
put
on

book
iii
the
third
book
of
the
histories
called
thaleia
against
this
amasis
then
cambyses
the
son
of
cyrus
was
making
his
march
taking
with
him
not
only
other
nations
of
which
he
was
ruler
but
also
hellenes
both
ionians
and
aiolians
and
the
cause
of
the
expedition
was
as
follows
sent
an
envoy
to
egypt
and
asked
amasis
to
give
him
his
daughter
and
he
made
the
request
by
counsel
of
an
egyptian
who
brought
this
upon
amasis
having
a
quarrel
with
him
for
the
following
reason
the
time
when
cyrus
sent
to
amasis
and
asked
him
for
a
physician
of
the
eyes
whosoever
was
the
best
of
those
in
egypt
amasis
had
selected
him
from
all
the
physicians
in
egypt
and
had
torn
him
away
from
his
wife
and
children
and
delivered
him
up
to
persia
having
i
say
this
cause
of
quarrel
the
egyptian
urged
cambyses
on
by
his
counsel
bidding
him
ask
amasis
for
his
daughter
in
order
that
he
might
either
be
grieved
if
he
gave
her
or
if
he
refused
to
give
her
might
offend
cambyses
so
amasis
who
was
vexed
by
the
power
of
the
persians
and
afraid
of
it
knew
neither
how
to
give
nor
how
to
refuse
for
he
was
well
assured
that
cambyses
did
not
intend
to
have
her
as
his
wife
but
as
a
concubine
so
making
account
of
the
matter
thus
he
did
as
follows
was
a
daughter
of
apries
the
former
king
very
tall
and
comely
of
form
and
the
only
person
left
of
his
house
and
her
name
was
nitetis
this
girl
amasis
adorned
with
raiment
and
with
gold
and
sent
her
away
to
persia
as
his
own
daughter
but
after
a
time
when
cambyses
saluted
her
calling
her
by
the
name
of
her
father
the
girl
said
to
him
o
king
thou
dost
not
perceive
how
thou
hast
been
deceived
by
amasis
for
he
adorned
me
with
ornaments
and
sent
me
away
giving
me
to
thee
as
his
own
daughter
whereas
in
truth
i
am
the
daughter
of
apries
against
whom
amasis
rose
up
with
the
egyptians
and
murdered
him
who
was
his
lord
and
master
these
words
uttered
and
this
occasion
having
arisen
led
cambyses
the
son
of
cyrus
against
egypt
moved
to
very
great
anger
such
is
the
report
made
by
the
persians
but
as
for
the
egyptians
they
claim
cambyses
as
one
of
themselves
saying
that
he
was
born
of
this
very
daughter
of
apries
for
they
say
that
cyrus
was
he
who
sent
to
amasis
for
his
daughter
and
not
cambyses
in
saying
this
however
they
say
not
rightly
nor
can
they
have
failed
to
observe
for
the
egyptians
fully
as
well
as
any
other
people
are
acquainted
with
the
laws
and
customs
of
the
persians
first
that
it
is
not
customary
among
them
for
a
bastard
to
become
king
when
there
is
a
son
born
of
a
true
marriage
and
secondly
that
cambyses
was
the
son
of
cassandane
the
daughter
of
pharnaspes
a
man
of
the
achaimenid
family
and
not
the
son
of
the
egyptian
woman
but
they
pervert
the
truth
of
history
claiming
to
be
kindred
with
the
house
of
cyrus
thus
it
is
with
these
matters
and
the
following
story
is
also
told
which
for
my
part
i
do
not
believe
namely
that
one
of
the
persian
women
came
in
to
the
wives
of
cyrus
and
when
she
saw
standing
by
the
side
of
cassandane
children
comely
of
form
and
tall
she
was
loud
in
her
praises
of
them
expressing
great
admiration
and
cassandane
who
was
the
wife
of
cyrus
spoke
as
follows
nevertheless
though
i
am
the
mother
of
such
children
of
these
cyrus
treats
me
with
dishonour
and
holds
in
honour
her
whom
he
has
brought
in
from
egypt
thus
she
spoke
they
say
being
vexed
by
nitetis
and
upon
that
cambyses
the
elder
of
her
sons
said
for
this
cause
mother
when
i
am
grown
to
be
a
man
i
will
make
that
which
is
above
in
egypt
to
be
below
and
that
which
is
below
above
this
he
is
reported
to
have
said
when
he
was
perhaps
about
ten
years
old
and
the
women
were
astonished
by
it
and
he
they
say
kept
it
ever
in
mind
and
so
at
last
when
he
had
become
a
man
and
had
obtained
the
royal
power
he
made
the
expedition
against
egypt
another
thing
also
contributed
to
this
expedition
which
was
as
follows
was
among
the
foreign
mercenaries
of
amasis
a
man
who
was
by
race
of
halicarnassos
and
his
name
was
phanes
one
who
was
both
capable
in
judgment
and
valiant
in
that
which
pertained
to
war
this
phanes
having
as
we
may
suppose
some
quarrel
with
amasis
fled
away
from
egypt
in
a
ship
desiring
to
come
to
speech
with
cambyses
and
as
he
was
of
no
small
repute
among
the
mercenaries
and
was
very
closely
acquainted
with
all
the
affairs
of
egypt
amasis
pursued
him
and
considered
it
a
matter
of
some
moment
to
capture
him
and
he
pursued
by
sending
after
him
the
most
trusted
of
his
eunuchs
with
a
trireme
who
captured
him
in
lykia
but
having
captured
him
he
did
not
bring
him
back
to
egypt
since
phanes
got
the
better
of
him
by
cunning
for
he
made
his
guards
drunk
and
escaped
to
persia
so
when
cambyses
had
made
his
resolve
to
march
upon
egypt
and
was
in
difficulty
about
the
march
as
to
how
he
should
get
safely
through
the
waterless
region
this
man
came
to
him
and
besides
informing
of
the
other
matters
of
amasis
he
instructed
him
also
as
to
the
march
advising
him
to
send
to
the
king
of
the
arabians
and
ask
that
he
would
give
him
safety
of
passage
through
this
region
now
by
this
way
only
is
there
a
known
entrance
to
egypt
for
from
phenicia
to
the
borders
of
the
city
of
cadytis
belongs
to
the
syrians
who
are
called
of
palestine
and
from
cadytis
which
is
a
city
i
suppose
not
much
less
than
sardis
from
this
city
the
trading
stations
on
the
as
far
as
the
city
of
ienysos
belong
to
the
king
of
arabia
and
then
from
ienysos
again
the
country
belongs
to
the
syrians
as
far
as
the
serbonian
lake
along
the
side
of
which
mount
casion
extends
towards
the
sea
after
that
from
the
serbonian
lake
in
which
the
story
goes
that
typhon
is
concealed
from
this
point
onwards
the
land
is
egypt
now
the
region
which
lies
between
the
city
of
ienysos
on
the
one
hand
and
mount
casion
and
the
serbonian
lake
on
the
other
which
is
of
no
small
extent
but
as
much
as
a
three
days
journey
is
grievously
destitute
of
water
and
one
thing
i
shall
tell
of
which
few
of
those
who
go
in
ships
to
egypt
have
observed
and
it
is
this
egypt
from
all
parts
of
hellas
and
also
from
phenicia
are
brought
twice
every
year
earthenware
jars
full
of
wine
and
yet
it
may
almost
be
said
that
you
can
not
see
there
one
single
empty
in
what
manner
then
it
will
be
asked
are
they
used
up
this
also
i
will
tell
the
of
each
place
must
collect
all
the
earthenware
jars
from
his
own
town
and
convey
them
to
memphis
and
those
at
memphis
must
fill
them
with
water
and
convey
them
to
these
same
waterless
regions
of
syria
this
the
jars
which
come
regularly
to
egypt
and
are
emptied
there
are
carried
to
syria
to
be
added
to
that
which
has
come
before
it
was
the
persians
who
thus
prepared
this
approach
to
egypt
furnishing
it
with
water
in
the
manner
which
has
been
said
from
the
time
when
they
first
took
possession
of
egypt
but
at
the
time
of
which
i
speak
seeing
that
water
was
not
yet
provided
cambyses
in
accordance
with
what
he
was
told
by
his
halicarnassian
guest
sent
envoys
to
the
arabian
king
and
from
him
asked
and
obtained
the
safe
passage
having
given
him
pledges
of
friendship
and
received
them
from
him
in
return
now
the
arabians
have
respect
for
pledges
of
friendship
as
much
as
those
men
in
all
the
world
who
regard
them
most
and
they
give
them
in
the
following
manner
man
different
from
those
who
desire
to
give
the
pledges
to
one
another
standing
in
the
midst
between
the
two
cuts
with
a
sharp
stone
the
inner
parts
of
the
hands
along
by
the
thumbs
of
those
who
are
giving
the
pledges
to
one
another
and
then
he
takes
a
thread
from
the
cloak
of
each
one
and
smears
with
the
blood
seven
stones
laid
in
the
midst
between
them
and
as
he
does
this
he
calls
upon
dionysos
and
urania
when
the
man
has
completed
these
ceremonies
he
who
has
given
the
pledges
commends
to
the
care
of
his
friends
the
stranger
or
the
if
he
is
giving
the
pledges
to
one
who
is
a
member
of
his
tribe
and
the
friends
think
it
right
that
they
also
should
have
regard
for
the
pledges
given
of
gods
they
believe
in
dionysos
and
urania
alone
moreover
they
say
that
the
cutting
of
their
hair
is
done
after
the
same
fashion
as
that
of
dionysos
himself
and
they
cut
their
hair
in
a
circle
round
shaving
away
the
hair
of
the
temples
now
they
call
dionysos
orotalt
and
urania
they
call
alilat
so
then
when
the
arabian
king
had
given
the
pledge
of
friendship
to
the
men
who
had
come
to
him
from
cambyses
he
contrived
as
follows
took
skins
of
camels
and
filled
them
with
water
and
loaded
them
upon
the
backs
of
all
the
living
camels
that
he
had
and
having
so
done
he
drove
them
to
the
waterless
region
and
there
awaited
the
army
of
cambyses
this
which
has
been
related
is
the
more
credible
of
the
accounts
given
but
the
less
credible
must
also
be
related
since
it
is
a
current
account
there
is
a
great
river
in
arabia
called
corys
and
this
runs
out
into
the
sea
which
is
called
erythraian
from
this
river
then
it
is
said
that
the
king
of
the
arabians
having
got
a
conduit
pipe
made
by
sewing
together
raw
and
other
skins
of
such
a
length
as
to
reach
to
the
waterless
region
conducted
the
water
through
these
forsooth
and
had
great
cisterns
dug
in
the
waterless
region
that
they
might
receive
the
water
and
preserve
it
now
it
is
a
journey
of
twelve
days
from
the
river
to
this
waterless
region
and
moreover
the
story
says
that
he
conducted
the
water
by
three
to
three
different
parts
of
it
meanwhile
psammenitos
the
son
of
amasis
was
encamped
at
the
pelusian
mouth
of
the
nile
waiting
for
the
coming
of
cambyses
for
cambyses
did
not
find
amasis
yet
living
when
he
marched
upon
egypt
but
amasis
had
died
after
having
reigned
forty
and
four
years
during
which
no
great
misfortune
had
befallen
him
and
when
he
had
died
and
had
been
embalmed
he
was
buried
in
the
in
the
temple
which
he
had
built
for
himself
now
when
psammenitos
son
of
amasis
was
reigning
as
king
there
happened
to
the
egyptians
a
prodigy
the
greatest
that
had
ever
happened
for
rain
fell
at
thebes
in
egypt
where
never
before
had
rain
fallen
nor
afterwards
down
to
my
time
as
the
thebans
themselves
say
for
in
the
upper
parts
of
egypt
no
rain
falls
at
all
but
at
the
time
of
which
i
speak
rain
fell
at
thebes
in
a
drizzling
shower
now
when
the
persians
had
marched
quite
through
the
waterless
region
and
were
encamped
near
the
egyptians
with
design
to
engage
battle
then
the
foreign
mercenaries
of
the
egyptian
king
who
were
hellenes
and
carians
having
a
quarrel
with
phanes
because
he
had
brought
against
egypt
an
army
of
foreign
speech
contrived
against
him
as
follows
had
children
whom
he
had
left
behind
in
egypt
these
they
brought
to
their
camp
and
into
the
sight
of
their
father
and
they
set
up
a
between
the
two
camps
and
after
that
they
brought
up
the
children
one
by
one
and
cut
their
throats
so
that
the
blood
ran
into
the
bowl
then
when
they
had
gone
through
the
whole
number
of
the
children
they
brought
and
poured
into
the
bowl
both
wine
and
water
and
not
until
the
mercenaries
had
all
drunk
of
the
blood
did
they
engage
battle
then
after
a
battle
had
been
fought
with
great
stubbornness
and
very
many
had
fallen
of
both
the
armies
the
egyptians
at
length
turned
to
flight
i
was
witness
moreover
of
a
great
marvel
being
informed
of
it
by
the
natives
of
the
place
for
of
the
bones
scattered
about
of
those
who
fell
in
this
fight
each
side
separately
since
the
bones
of
the
persians
were
lying
apart
on
one
side
according
as
they
were
divided
at
first
and
those
of
the
egyptians
on
the
other
the
skulls
of
the
persians
are
so
weak
that
if
you
shall
hit
them
only
with
a
pebble
you
will
make
a
hole
in
them
while
those
of
the
egyptians
are
so
exceedingly
strong
that
you
would
hardly
break
them
if
you
struck
them
with
a
large
stone
the
cause
of
it
they
say
was
this
and
i
for
my
part
readily
believe
them
namely
that
the
egyptians
beginning
from
their
early
childhood
shave
their
heads
and
the
bone
is
thickened
by
exposure
to
the
sun
and
this
is
also
the
cause
of
their
not
becoming
for
among
the
egyptians
you
see
fewer
men
than
among
any
other
race
this
then
is
the
reason
why
these
have
their
skulls
strong
and
the
reason
why
the
persians
have
theirs
weak
is
that
they
keep
them
delicately
in
the
shade
from
the
first
by
wearing
tiaras
that
is
felt
caps
so
far
of
this
and
i
saw
also
a
similar
thing
to
this
at
papremis
in
the
case
of
those
who
were
slain
together
with
achaimenes
the
son
of
dareios
by
inaros
the
libyan
the
egyptians
when
they
turned
to
flight
from
the
battle
fled
in
disorder
and
they
being
shut
up
in
memphis
cambyses
sent
a
ship
of
mytilene
up
the
river
bearing
a
persian
herald
to
summon
the
egyptians
to
make
terms
of
surrender
but
they
when
they
saw
the
ship
had
entered
into
memphis
pouring
forth
in
a
body
from
the
fortress
both
destroyed
the
ship
and
also
tore
the
men
in
it
limb
from
limb
and
so
bore
them
into
the
fortress
after
this
the
egyptians
being
besieged
in
course
of
time
surrendered
themselves
and
the
libyans
who
dwell
on
the
borders
of
egypt
being
struck
with
terror
by
that
which
had
happened
to
egypt
delivered
themselves
up
without
resistance
and
they
both
laid
on
themselves
a
tribute
and
sent
presents
likewise
also
those
of
kyrene
and
barca
being
struck
with
terror
equally
with
the
libyans
acted
in
a
similar
manner
and
cambyses
accepted
graciously
the
gifts
which
came
from
the
libyans
but
as
for
those
which
came
from
the
men
of
kyrene
finding
fault
with
them
as
i
suppose
because
they
were
too
small
in
amount
for
the
kyrenians
sent
in
fact
five
hundred
weight
of
silver
he
took
the
silver
by
handfuls
and
scattered
it
with
his
own
hand
among
his
soldiers
on
the
tenth
day
after
that
on
which
he
received
the
surrender
of
the
fortress
of
memphis
cambyses
set
the
king
of
the
egyptians
psammenitos
who
had
been
king
for
six
months
to
sit
in
the
suburb
of
the
city
to
do
him
dishonour
i
say
with
other
egyptians
he
set
there
and
he
proceeded
to
make
trial
of
his
spirit
as
follows
arrayed
his
daughter
in
the
clothing
of
a
slave
he
sent
her
forth
with
a
pitcher
to
fetch
water
and
with
her
he
sent
also
other
maidens
chosen
from
the
daughters
of
the
chief
men
arrayed
as
was
the
daughter
of
the
king
and
as
the
maidens
were
passing
by
their
fathers
with
cries
and
lamentation
the
other
men
all
began
to
cry
out
and
lament
aloud
seeing
that
their
children
had
been
evilly
entreated
but
psammenitos
when
he
saw
it
before
his
eyes
and
perceived
it
bent
himself
down
to
the
earth
then
when
the
had
passed
by
next
cambyses
sent
his
son
with
two
thousand
egyptians
besides
who
were
of
the
same
age
with
ropes
bound
round
their
necks
and
bits
placed
in
their
mouths
and
these
were
being
led
away
to
execution
to
avenge
the
death
of
the
mytilenians
who
had
been
destroyed
at
memphis
with
their
ship
for
the
royal
judges
had
decided
that
for
each
man
ten
of
the
noblest
egyptians
should
lose
their
lives
in
retaliation
he
then
when
he
saw
them
passing
out
by
him
and
perceived
that
his
son
was
leading
the
way
to
die
did
the
same
as
he
had
done
with
respect
to
his
daughter
while
the
other
egyptians
who
sat
round
him
were
lamenting
and
showing
signs
of
grief
when
these
also
had
passed
by
it
chanced
that
a
man
of
his
table
companions
advanced
in
years
who
had
been
deprived
of
all
his
possessions
and
had
nothing
except
such
things
as
a
beggar
possesses
and
was
asking
alms
from
the
soldiers
passed
by
psammenitos
the
son
of
amasis
and
the
egyptians
who
were
sitting
in
the
suburb
of
the
city
and
when
psammenitos
saw
him
he
uttered
a
great
cry
of
lamentation
and
he
called
his
companion
by
name
and
beat
himself
upon
the
head
now
there
was
it
seems
men
set
to
watch
him
who
made
known
to
cambyses
all
that
he
did
on
the
occasion
of
each
going
forth
and
cambyses
marvelled
at
that
which
he
did
and
he
sent
a
messenger
and
asked
him
thus
psammenitos
thy
master
cambyses
asks
thee
for
what
reason
when
thou
sawest
thy
daughter
evilly
entreated
and
thy
son
going
to
death
thou
didst
not
cry
aloud
nor
lament
for
them
whereas
thou
didst
honour
with
these
signs
of
grief
the
beggar
who
as
he
hears
from
others
is
not
in
any
way
related
to
thee
thus
he
asked
and
the
other
answered
as
follows
o
son
of
cyrus
my
own
troubles
were
too
great
for
me
to
lament
them
aloud
but
the
trouble
of
my
companion
was
such
as
called
for
tears
seeing
that
he
has
been
deprived
of
great
wealth
and
has
come
to
beggary
upon
the
threshold
of
old
age
when
this
saying
was
reported
by
the
messenger
it
seemed
to
them
that
it
was
well
spoken
and
as
is
reported
by
the
egyptians
croesus
shed
tears
for
he
also
as
fortune
would
have
it
had
accompanied
cambyses
to
egypt
and
the
persians
who
were
present
shed
tears
also
and
there
entered
some
pity
into
cambyses
himself
and
forthwith
he
bade
them
save
the
life
of
the
son
of
psammenitos
from
among
those
who
were
being
put
to
death
and
also
he
bade
them
raise
psammenitos
himself
from
his
place
in
the
suburb
of
the
city
and
bring
him
into
his
own
presence
as
for
the
son
those
who
went
for
him
found
that
he
was
no
longer
alive
but
had
been
cut
down
first
of
all
but
psammenitos
himself
they
raised
from
his
place
and
brought
him
into
the
presence
of
cambyses
with
whom
he
continued
to
live
for
the
rest
of
his
time
without
suffering
any
violence
and
if
he
had
known
how
to
keep
himself
from
meddling
with
mischief
he
would
have
received
egypt
so
as
to
be
ruler
of
it
since
the
persians
are
wont
to
honour
the
sons
of
kings
and
even
if
the
kings
have
revolted
from
them
they
give
back
the
power
into
the
hands
of
their
sons
of
this
namely
that
it
is
their
established
rule
to
act
so
one
may
judge
by
many
instances
besides
and
especially
by
the
case
of
thannyras
the
son
of
inaros
who
received
back
the
power
which
his
father
had
and
by
that
of
pausiris
the
son
of
amyrtaios
for
he
too
received
back
the
power
of
his
father
yet
it
is
certain
that
no
men
ever
up
to
this
time
did
more
evil
to
the
persians
than
inaros
and
amyrtaios
as
it
was
however
psammenitos
devised
evil
and
received
the
due
reward
for
he
was
found
to
be
inciting
the
egyptians
to
revolt
and
when
this
became
known
to
cambyses
psammenitos
drank
bull
blood
and
died
forthwith
thus
he
came
to
his
end
from
memphis
cambyses
came
to
the
city
of
saïs
with
the
purpose
of
doing
that
which
in
fact
he
did
for
when
he
had
entered
into
the
palace
of
amasis
he
forthwith
gave
command
to
bring
the
corpse
of
amasis
forth
out
of
his
and
when
this
had
been
accomplished
he
gave
command
to
scourge
it
and
pluck
out
the
hair
and
stab
it
and
to
do
to
it
dishonour
in
every
possible
way
besides
and
when
they
had
done
this
too
until
they
were
wearied
out
for
the
corpse
being
embalmed
held
out
against
the
violence
and
did
not
fall
to
pieces
in
any
part
cambyses
gave
command
to
consume
it
with
fire
enjoining
thereby
a
thing
which
was
not
permitted
by
religion
for
the
persians
hold
fire
to
be
a
god
to
consume
corpses
with
fire
then
is
by
no
means
according
to
the
custom
of
either
people
of
the
persians
for
the
reason
which
has
been
mentioned
since
they
say
that
it
is
not
right
to
give
the
dead
body
of
a
man
to
a
god
while
the
egyptians
have
the
belief
established
that
fire
is
a
living
wild
beast
and
that
it
devours
everything
which
it
catches
and
when
it
is
satiated
with
the
food
it
dies
itself
together
with
that
which
it
devours
but
it
is
by
no
means
their
custom
to
give
the
corpse
of
a
man
to
wild
beasts
for
which
reason
they
embalm
it
that
it
may
not
be
eaten
by
worms
as
it
lies
in
the
tomb
thus
then
cambyses
was
enjoining
them
to
do
that
which
is
not
permitted
by
the
customs
of
either
people
however
the
egyptians
say
that
it
was
not
amasis
who
suffered
this
outrage
but
another
of
the
egyptians
who
was
of
the
same
stature
of
body
as
amasis
and
that
to
him
the
persians
did
outrage
thinking
that
they
were
doing
it
to
amasis
for
they
say
that
amasis
learnt
from
an
oracle
that
which
was
about
to
happen
with
regard
to
himself
after
his
death
and
accordingly
to
avert
the
evil
which
threatened
to
come
upon
him
he
buried
the
dead
body
of
this
man
who
was
scourged
within
his
own
sepulchral
chamber
near
the
doors
and
enjoined
his
son
to
lay
his
own
body
as
much
as
possible
in
the
inner
recess
of
the
chamber
these
injunctions
said
to
have
been
given
by
amasis
with
regard
to
his
burial
and
with
regard
to
the
man
mentioned
were
not
in
my
opinion
really
given
at
all
but
i
think
that
the
egyptians
make
pretence
of
it
from
pride
and
with
no
good
ground
after
this
cambyses
planned
three
several
expeditions
one
against
the
carthaginians
another
against
the
ammonians
and
a
third
against
the
ethiopians
who
dwell
in
that
part
of
libya
which
is
by
the
southern
sea
and
in
forming
these
designs
he
resolved
to
send
his
naval
force
against
the
carthaginians
and
a
body
chosen
from
his
against
the
ammonians
and
to
the
ethiopians
to
send
spies
first
both
to
see
whether
the
table
of
the
sun
existed
really
which
is
said
to
exist
among
these
ethiopians
and
in
addition
to
this
to
spy
out
all
else
but
pretending
to
be
bearers
of
gifts
for
their
king
now
the
table
of
the
sun
is
said
to
be
as
follows
is
a
meadow
in
the
suburb
of
their
city
full
of
boiled
of
all
creatures
and
in
this
it
is
said
those
of
the
citizens
who
are
in
authority
at
the
time
place
the
flesh
by
night
managing
the
matter
carefully
and
by
day
any
man
who
wishes
comes
there
and
feasts
himself
and
the
natives
it
is
reported
say
that
the
earth
of
herself
produces
these
things
continually
of
such
nature
is
the
table
of
the
sun
said
to
be
so
when
cambyses
had
resolved
to
send
the
spies
forthwith
he
sent
for
those
men
of
the
ichthyophagoi
who
understood
the
ethiopian
tongue
to
come
from
the
city
of
elephantine
and
while
they
were
going
to
fetch
these
men
he
gave
command
to
the
fleet
to
sail
against
carthage
but
the
phenicians
said
that
they
would
not
do
so
for
they
were
bound
not
to
do
so
by
solemn
vows
and
they
would
not
be
acting
piously
if
they
made
expedition
against
their
own
sons
and
as
the
phenicians
were
not
willing
the
rest
were
rendered
unequal
to
the
attempt
thus
then
the
carthaginians
escaped
being
enslaved
by
the
persians
for
cambyses
did
not
think
it
right
to
apply
force
to
compel
the
phenicians
both
because
they
had
delivered
themselves
over
to
the
persians
of
their
own
accord
and
because
the
whole
naval
force
was
dependent
upon
the
phenicians
now
the
men
of
cyprus
also
had
delivered
themselves
over
to
the
persians
and
were
joining
in
the
expedition
against
egypt
then
as
soon
as
the
ichthyophagoi
came
to
cambyses
from
elephantine
he
sent
them
to
the
ethiopians
enjoining
them
what
they
should
say
and
giving
them
gifts
to
bear
with
them
that
is
to
say
a
purple
garment
and
a
collar
of
twisted
gold
with
bracelets
and
an
alabaster
box
of
perfumed
ointment
and
a
jar
of
now
these
ethiopians
to
whom
cambyses
was
sending
are
said
to
be
the
tallest
and
the
most
beautiful
of
all
men
and
besides
other
customs
which
they
are
reported
to
have
different
from
other
men
there
is
especially
this
it
is
said
with
regard
to
their
regal
power
of
the
men
of
their
nation
they
judge
to
be
the
tallest
and
to
have
strength
in
proportion
to
his
stature
this
man
they
appoint
to
reign
over
them
so
when
the
ichthyophagoi
had
come
to
this
people
they
presented
their
gifts
to
the
king
who
ruled
over
them
and
at
the
same
time
they
said
as
follows
the
king
of
the
persians
cambyses
desiring
to
become
a
friend
and
guest
to
thee
sent
us
with
command
to
come
to
speech
with
thee
and
he
gives
thee
for
gifts
these
things
which
he
himself
most
delights
to
use
the
ethiopian
however
perceiving
that
they
had
come
as
spies
spoke
to
them
as
follows
neither
did
the
king
of
the
persians
send
you
bearing
gifts
because
he
thought
it
a
matter
of
great
moment
to
become
my
nor
do
ye
speak
true
things
for
ye
have
come
as
spies
of
my
kingdom
nor
again
is
he
a
righteous
man
for
if
he
had
been
righteous
he
would
not
have
coveted
a
land
other
than
his
own
nor
would
he
be
leading
away
into
slavery
men
at
whose
hands
he
has
received
no
wrong
now
however
give
him
this
bow
and
speak
to
him
these
words
the
king
of
the
ethiopians
gives
this
counsel
to
the
king
of
the
persians
that
when
the
persians
draw
their
bows
of
equal
size
to
mine
as
easily
as
i
do
this
then
he
should
march
against
the
ethiopians
provided
that
he
be
superior
in
numbers
but
until
that
time
he
should
feel
gratitude
to
the
gods
that
they
do
not
put
it
into
the
mind
of
the
sons
of
the
ethiopians
to
acquire
another
land
in
addition
to
their
own
having
thus
said
and
having
unbent
the
bow
he
delivered
it
to
those
who
had
come
then
he
took
the
garment
of
purple
and
asked
what
it
was
and
how
it
had
been
made
and
when
the
ichthyophagoi
had
told
him
the
truth
about
the
and
the
dyeing
of
the
tissue
he
said
that
the
men
were
deceitful
and
deceitful
also
were
their
garments
then
secondly
he
asked
concerning
the
twisted
gold
of
the
collar
and
the
bracelets
and
when
the
ichthyophagoi
were
setting
forth
to
him
the
manner
in
which
it
was
fashioned
the
king
broke
into
a
laugh
and
said
supposing
them
to
be
fetters
that
they
had
stronger
fetters
than
those
in
their
country
thirdly
he
asked
about
the
perfumed
ointment
and
when
they
had
told
him
of
the
manner
of
its
making
and
of
the
anointing
with
it
he
said
the
same
as
he
had
said
before
about
the
garment
then
when
he
came
to
the
wine
and
had
learned
about
the
manner
of
its
making
being
exceedingly
delighted
with
the
taste
of
the
drink
he
asked
besides
what
food
the
king
ate
and
what
was
the
longest
time
that
a
persian
man
lived
they
told
him
that
he
ate
bread
explaining
to
him
first
the
manner
of
growing
the
wheat
and
they
said
that
eighty
years
was
the
longest
term
of
life
appointed
for
a
persian
man
in
answer
to
this
the
ethiopian
said
that
he
did
not
wonder
that
they
lived
but
a
few
years
when
they
fed
upon
dung
for
indeed
they
would
not
be
able
to
live
even
so
many
years
as
this
if
they
did
not
renew
their
vigour
with
the
drink
indicating
to
the
ichthyophagoi
the
wine
for
in
regard
to
this
he
said
his
people
were
much
behind
the
persians
then
when
the
ichthyophagoi
asked
the
king
in
return
about
the
length
of
days
and
the
manner
of
life
of
his
people
he
answered
that
the
greater
number
of
them
reached
the
age
of
a
hundred
and
twenty
years
and
some
surpassed
even
this
and
their
food
was
boiled
flesh
and
their
drink
was
milk
and
when
the
spies
marvelled
at
the
number
of
years
he
conducted
them
to
a
certain
spring
in
the
water
of
which
they
washed
and
became
more
sleek
of
skin
as
if
it
were
a
spring
of
oil
and
from
it
there
came
a
scent
as
it
were
of
violets
and
the
water
of
this
spring
said
the
spies
was
so
exceedingly
weak
that
it
was
not
possible
for
anything
to
float
upon
it
either
wood
or
any
of
those
things
which
are
lighter
than
wood
but
they
all
went
to
the
bottom
if
this
water
which
they
have
be
really
such
as
it
is
said
to
be
it
would
doubtless
be
the
cause
why
the
people
are
as
making
use
of
it
for
all
the
purposes
of
life
then
when
they
departed
from
this
spring
he
led
them
to
a
for
men
and
there
all
were
bound
in
fetters
of
gold
now
among
these
ethiopians
bronze
is
the
rarest
and
most
precious
of
all
things
then
when
they
had
seen
the
they
saw
also
the
table
of
the
sun
and
after
this
they
saw
last
of
all
their
receptacles
of
dead
bodies
which
are
said
to
be
made
of
crystal
in
the
following
manner
they
have
dried
the
corpse
whether
it
be
after
the
egyptian
fashion
or
in
some
other
way
they
cover
it
over
completely
with
plaster
and
then
adorn
it
with
painting
making
the
figure
as
far
as
possible
like
the
living
man
after
this
they
put
about
it
a
block
of
crystal
hollowed
out
for
this
they
dig
up
in
great
quantity
and
it
is
very
easy
to
work
and
the
dead
body
being
in
the
middle
of
the
block
is
visible
through
it
but
produces
no
unpleasant
smell
nor
any
other
effect
which
is
unseemly
and
it
has
all
its
parts
visible
like
the
dead
body
itself
for
a
year
then
they
who
are
most
nearly
related
to
the
man
keep
the
block
in
their
house
giving
to
the
dead
man
the
first
share
of
everything
and
offering
to
him
sacrifices
and
after
this
period
they
carry
it
out
and
set
it
up
round
about
the
city
after
they
had
seen
all
the
spies
departed
to
go
back
and
when
they
reported
these
things
forthwith
cambyses
was
enraged
and
proceeded
to
march
his
army
against
the
ethiopians
not
having
ordered
any
provision
of
food
nor
considered
with
himself
that
he
was
intending
to
march
an
army
to
the
furthest
extremities
of
the
earth
but
as
one
who
is
mad
and
not
in
his
right
senses
when
he
heard
the
report
of
the
ichthyophagoi
he
began
the
march
ordering
those
of
the
hellenes
who
were
present
to
remain
behind
in
egypt
and
taking
with
him
his
whole
land
force
and
when
in
the
course
of
his
march
he
had
arrived
at
thebes
he
divided
off
about
fifty
thousand
of
his
army
and
these
he
enjoined
to
make
slaves
of
the
ammonians
and
to
set
fire
to
the
seat
of
the
oracle
of
zeus
but
he
himself
with
the
remainder
of
his
army
went
on
against
the
ethiopians
but
before
the
army
had
passed
over
the
fifth
part
of
the
way
all
that
they
had
of
provisions
came
to
an
end
completely
and
then
after
the
provisions
the
beasts
of
burden
also
were
eaten
up
and
came
to
an
end
now
if
cambyses
when
he
perceived
this
had
changed
his
plan
and
led
his
army
back
he
would
have
been
a
wise
man
in
spite
of
his
first
mistake
as
it
was
however
he
paid
no
regard
but
went
on
forward
without
stopping
the
soldiers
accordingly
so
long
as
they
were
able
to
get
anything
from
the
ground
prolonged
their
lives
by
eating
grass
but
when
they
came
to
the
sand
some
did
a
fearful
deed
that
is
to
say
out
of
each
company
of
ten
they
selected
by
lot
one
of
themselves
and
devoured
him
and
cambyses
when
he
heard
it
being
alarmed
by
this
eating
of
one
another
gave
up
the
expedition
against
the
ethiopians
and
set
forth
to
go
back
again
and
he
arrived
at
thebes
having
suffered
loss
of
a
great
number
of
his
army
then
from
thebes
he
came
down
to
memphis
and
allowed
the
hellenes
to
sail
away
home
thus
fared
the
expedition
against
the
ethiopians
and
those
of
the
persians
who
had
been
sent
to
march
against
the
ammonians
set
forth
from
thebes
and
went
on
their
way
with
guides
and
it
is
known
that
they
arrived
at
the
city
of
oasis
which
is
inhabited
by
samians
said
to
be
of
the
aischrionian
tribe
and
is
distant
seven
days
journey
from
thebes
over
sandy
desert
now
this
place
is
called
in
the
speech
of
the
hellenes
the
isle
of
the
blessed
it
is
said
that
the
army
reached
this
place
but
from
that
point
onwards
except
the
ammonians
themselves
and
those
who
have
heard
the
account
from
them
no
man
is
able
to
say
anything
about
them
for
they
neither
reached
the
ammonians
nor
returned
back
this
however
is
added
to
the
story
by
the
ammonians
themselves
say
that
as
the
army
was
going
from
this
oasis
through
the
sandy
desert
to
attack
them
and
had
got
to
a
point
about
between
them
and
the
oasis
while
they
were
taking
their
morning
meal
a
violent
south
wind
blew
upon
them
and
bearing
with
it
heaps
of
the
desert
sand
it
buried
them
under
it
and
so
they
disappeared
and
were
seen
no
more
thus
the
ammonians
say
that
it
came
to
pass
with
regard
to
this
army
when
cambyses
arrived
at
memphis
apis
appeared
to
the
egyptians
whom
the
hellenes
call
epaphos
and
when
he
had
appeared
forthwith
the
egyptians
began
to
wear
their
fairest
garments
and
to
have
festivities
cambyses
accordingly
seeing
the
egyptians
doing
thus
and
supposing
that
they
were
certainly
acting
so
by
way
of
rejoicing
because
he
had
fared
ill
called
for
the
officers
who
had
charge
of
memphis
and
when
they
had
come
into
his
presence
he
asked
them
why
when
he
was
at
memphis
on
the
former
occasion
the
egyptians
were
doing
nothing
of
this
kind
but
only
now
when
he
came
there
after
losing
a
large
part
of
his
army
they
said
that
a
god
had
appeared
to
them
who
was
wont
to
appear
at
intervals
of
long
time
and
that
whenever
he
appeared
then
all
the
egyptians
rejoiced
and
kept
festival
hearing
this
cambyses
said
that
they
were
lying
and
as
liars
he
condemned
them
to
death
having
put
these
to
death
next
he
called
the
priests
into
his
presence
and
when
the
priests
answered
him
after
the
same
manner
he
said
that
it
should
not
be
without
his
knowledge
if
a
tame
god
had
come
to
the
egyptians
and
having
so
said
he
bade
the
priests
bring
apis
away
into
his
presence
so
they
went
to
bring
him
now
this
is
a
calf
born
of
a
cow
who
after
this
is
not
permitted
to
conceive
any
other
offspring
and
the
egyptians
say
that
a
flash
of
light
comes
down
from
heaven
upon
this
cow
and
of
this
she
produces
apis
this
calf
which
is
called
apis
is
black
and
has
the
following
signs
namely
a
white
square
upon
the
forehead
and
on
the
back
the
likeness
of
an
eagle
and
in
the
tail
the
hairs
are
double
and
on
the
tongue
there
is
a
mark
like
a
beetle
when
the
priests
had
brought
apis
cambyses
being
somewhat
affected
with
madness
drew
his
dagger
and
aiming
at
the
belly
of
apis
struck
his
thigh
then
he
laughed
and
said
to
the
priests
o
ye
wretched
creatures
are
gods
born
such
as
this
with
blood
and
flesh
and
sensible
of
the
stroke
of
iron
weapons
worthy
indeed
of
egyptians
is
such
a
god
as
this
ye
however
at
least
shall
not
escape
without
punishment
for
making
a
mock
of
me
having
thus
spoken
he
ordered
those
whose
duty
it
was
to
do
such
things
to
scourge
the
priests
without
mercy
and
to
put
to
death
any
one
of
the
other
egyptians
whom
they
should
find
keeping
the
festival
thus
the
festival
of
the
egyptians
had
been
brought
to
an
end
and
the
priests
were
being
chastised
and
apis
wounded
by
the
stroke
in
his
thigh
lay
dying
in
the
temple
him
when
he
had
brought
his
life
to
an
end
by
reason
of
the
wound
the
priests
buried
without
the
knowledge
of
cambyses
but
cambyses
as
the
egyptians
say
immediately
after
this
evil
deed
became
absolutely
mad
not
having
been
really
in
his
right
senses
even
before
that
time
and
the
first
of
his
evil
deeds
was
that
he
put
to
death
his
brother
smerdis
who
was
of
the
same
father
and
the
same
mother
as
himself
this
brother
he
had
sent
away
from
egypt
to
persia
in
envy
because
alone
of
all
the
persians
he
had
been
able
to
draw
the
bow
which
the
ichthyophagoi
brought
from
the
ethiopian
king
to
an
extent
of
about
two
while
of
the
other
persians
not
one
had
proved
able
to
do
this
then
when
smerdis
had
gone
away
to
persia
cambyses
saw
a
vision
in
his
sleep
of
this
kind
seemed
to
him
that
a
messenger
came
from
persia
and
reported
that
smerdis
sitting
upon
the
royal
throne
had
touched
the
heaven
with
his
head
fearing
therefore
with
regard
to
this
lest
his
brother
might
slay
him
and
reign
in
his
stead
he
sent
prexaspes
to
persia
the
man
whom
of
all
the
persians
he
trusted
most
with
command
to
slay
him
he
accordingly
went
up
to
susa
and
slew
smerdis
and
some
say
that
he
took
him
out
of
the
chase
and
so
slew
him
others
that
he
brought
him
to
the
erythraian
sea
and
drowned
him
this
they
say
was
the
first
beginning
of
the
evil
deeds
of
cambyses
and
next
after
this
he
put
to
death
his
sister
who
had
accompanied
him
to
egypt
to
whom
also
he
was
married
she
being
his
sister
by
both
parents
now
he
took
her
to
wife
in
the
following
manner
for
before
this
the
persians
had
not
been
wont
at
all
to
marry
their
sisters
fell
in
love
with
one
of
his
sisters
and
desired
to
take
her
to
wife
so
since
he
had
it
in
mind
to
do
that
which
was
not
customary
he
called
the
royal
judges
and
asked
them
whether
there
existed
any
law
which
permitted
him
who
desired
it
to
marry
his
sister
now
the
royal
judges
are
men
chosen
out
from
among
the
persians
and
hold
their
office
until
they
die
or
until
some
injustice
is
found
in
them
so
long
and
no
longer
these
pronounce
decisions
for
the
persians
and
are
the
expounders
of
the
ordinances
of
their
fathers
and
all
matters
are
referred
to
them
so
when
cambyses
asked
them
they
gave
him
an
answer
which
was
both
upright
and
safe
saying
that
they
found
no
law
which
permitted
a
brother
to
marry
his
sister
but
apart
from
that
they
had
found
a
law
to
the
effect
that
the
king
of
the
persians
might
do
whatsoever
he
desired
thus
on
the
one
hand
they
did
not
tamper
with
the
law
for
fear
of
cambyses
and
at
the
same
time
that
they
might
not
perish
themselves
in
maintaining
the
law
they
found
another
law
beside
that
which
was
asked
for
which
was
in
favour
of
him
who
wished
to
marry
his
sisters
so
cambyses
at
that
time
took
to
wife
her
with
whom
he
was
in
love
but
after
no
long
time
he
took
another
sister
of
these
it
was
the
younger
whom
he
put
to
death
she
having
accompanied
him
to
egypt
about
her
death
as
about
the
death
of
smerdis
two
different
stories
are
told
the
hellenes
say
that
cambyses
had
matched
a
cub
in
fight
with
a
dog
whelp
and
this
wife
of
his
was
also
a
spectator
of
it
and
when
the
whelp
was
being
overcome
another
whelp
its
brother
broke
its
chain
and
came
to
help
it
and
having
become
two
instead
of
one
the
whelps
then
got
the
better
of
the
cub
and
cambyses
was
pleased
at
the
sight
but
she
sitting
by
him
began
to
weep
and
cambyses
perceived
it
and
asked
wherefore
she
wept
and
she
said
that
she
had
wept
when
she
saw
that
the
whelp
had
come
to
the
assistance
of
its
brother
because
she
remembered
smerdis
and
perceived
that
there
was
no
one
who
would
come
to
his
assistance
the
hellenes
say
that
it
was
for
this
saying
that
she
was
killed
by
cambyses
but
the
egyptians
say
that
as
they
were
sitting
round
at
table
the
wife
took
a
lettuce
and
pulled
off
the
leaves
all
round
and
then
asked
her
husband
whether
the
lettuce
was
fairer
when
thus
plucked
round
or
when
covered
with
leaves
and
he
said
when
covered
with
leaves
she
then
spoke
thus
nevertheless
thou
didst
once
produce
the
likeness
of
this
lettuce
when
thou
didst
strip
bare
the
house
of
cyrus
and
he
moved
to
anger
leapt
upon
her
being
with
child
and
she
miscarried
and
died
these
were
the
acts
of
madness
done
by
cambyses
towards
those
of
his
own
family
whether
the
madness
was
produced
really
on
account
of
apis
or
from
some
other
cause
as
many
ills
are
wont
to
seize
upon
men
for
it
is
said
moreover
that
cambyses
had
from
his
birth
a
certain
grievous
malady
that
which
is
called
by
some
the
sacred
disease
and
it
was
certainly
nothing
strange
that
when
the
body
was
suffering
from
a
grievous
malady
the
mind
should
not
be
sound
either
the
following
also
are
acts
of
madness
which
he
did
to
the
other
persians
prexaspes
the
man
whom
he
honoured
most
and
who
used
to
bear
his
messages
his
son
also
was
to
cambyses
and
this
too
was
no
small
honour
him
it
is
said
that
he
spoke
as
follows
prexaspes
what
kind
of
a
man
do
the
persians
esteem
me
to
be
and
what
speech
do
they
hold
concerning
me
and
he
said
master
in
all
other
respects
thou
art
greatly
commended
but
they
say
that
thou
art
overmuch
given
to
love
of
wine
thus
he
spoke
concerning
the
persians
and
upon
that
cambyses
was
roused
to
anger
and
answered
thus
it
appears
then
that
the
persians
say
i
am
given
to
wine
and
that
therefore
i
am
beside
myself
and
not
in
my
right
mind
and
their
former
speech
then
was
not
sincere
for
before
this
time
it
seems
when
the
persians
and
croesus
were
sitting
with
him
in
council
cambyses
asked
what
kind
of
a
man
they
thought
he
was
as
compared
with
his
father
cyrus
and
they
answered
that
he
was
better
than
his
father
for
he
not
only
possessed
all
that
his
father
had
possessed
but
also
in
addition
to
this
had
acquired
egypt
and
the
sea
thus
the
persians
spoke
but
croesus
who
was
present
and
was
not
satisfied
with
their
judgment
spoke
thus
to
cambyses
to
me
o
son
of
cyrus
thou
dost
not
appear
to
be
equal
to
thy
father
for
not
yet
hast
thou
a
son
such
as
he
left
behind
him
in
you
hearing
this
cambyses
was
pleased
and
commended
the
judgment
of
croesus
so
calling
to
mind
this
he
said
in
anger
to
prexaspes
learn
then
now
for
thyself
whether
the
persians
speak
truly
or
whether
when
they
say
this
they
are
themselves
out
of
their
senses
for
if
i
shooting
at
thy
son
there
standing
before
the
entrance
of
the
chamber
hit
him
in
the
very
middle
of
the
heart
the
persians
will
be
proved
to
be
speaking
falsely
but
if
i
miss
then
thou
mayest
say
that
the
persians
are
speaking
the
truth
and
that
i
am
not
in
my
right
mind
having
thus
said
he
drew
his
bow
and
hit
the
boy
and
when
the
boy
had
fallen
down
it
is
said
that
he
ordered
them
to
cut
open
his
body
and
examine
the
place
where
he
was
hit
and
as
the
arrow
was
found
to
be
sticking
in
the
heart
he
laughed
and
was
delighted
and
said
to
the
father
of
the
boy
prexaspes
it
has
now
been
made
evident
as
thou
seest
that
i
am
not
mad
but
that
it
is
the
persians
who
are
out
of
their
senses
and
now
tell
me
whom
of
all
men
didst
thou
ever
see
before
this
time
hit
the
mark
so
well
in
shooting
then
prexaspes
seeing
that
the
man
was
not
in
his
right
senses
and
fearing
for
himself
said
master
i
think
that
not
even
god
himself
could
have
hit
the
mark
so
fairly
thus
he
did
at
that
time
and
at
another
time
he
condemned
twelve
of
the
persians
men
equal
to
the
best
on
a
charge
of
no
moment
and
buried
them
alive
with
the
head
downwards
when
he
was
doing
these
things
croesus
the
lydian
judged
it
right
to
admonish
him
in
the
following
words
o
king
do
not
thou
indulge
the
heat
of
thy
youth
and
passion
in
all
things
but
retain
and
hold
thyself
back
it
is
a
good
thing
to
be
prudent
and
forethought
is
wise
thou
however
are
putting
to
death
men
who
are
of
thine
own
people
condemning
them
on
charges
of
no
moment
and
thou
art
putting
to
death
men
sons
also
if
thou
do
many
such
things
beware
lest
the
persians
make
revolt
from
thee
as
for
me
thy
father
cyrus
gave
me
charge
earnestly
bidding
me
to
admonish
thee
and
suggest
to
thee
that
which
i
should
find
to
be
good
thus
he
counselled
him
manifesting
goodwill
towards
him
but
cambyses
answered
dost
thou
venture
to
counsel
me
who
excellently
well
didst
rule
thine
own
country
and
well
didst
counsel
my
father
bidding
him
pass
over
the
river
araxes
and
go
against
the
massagetai
when
they
were
willing
to
pass
over
into
our
land
and
so
didst
utterly
ruin
thyself
by
ill
government
of
thine
own
land
and
didst
utterly
ruin
cyrus
who
followed
thy
counsel
however
thou
shalt
not
escape
punishment
now
for
know
that
before
this
i
had
very
long
been
desiring
to
find
some
occasion
against
thee
thus
having
said
he
took
his
bow
meaning
to
shoot
him
but
croesus
started
up
and
ran
out
and
so
since
he
could
not
shoot
him
he
gave
orders
to
his
attendants
to
take
and
slay
him
the
attendants
however
knowing
his
moods
concealed
croesus
with
the
intention
that
if
cambyses
should
change
his
mind
and
seek
to
have
croesus
again
they
might
produce
him
and
receive
gifts
as
the
price
of
saving
his
life
but
if
he
did
not
change
his
mind
nor
feel
desire
to
have
him
back
then
they
might
kill
him
not
long
afterwards
cambyses
did
in
fact
desire
to
have
croesus
again
and
the
attendants
perceiving
this
reported
to
him
that
he
was
still
alive
and
cambyses
said
that
he
rejoiced
with
croesus
that
he
was
still
alive
but
that
they
who
had
preserved
him
should
not
get
off
free
but
he
would
put
them
to
death
and
thus
he
did
many
such
acts
of
madness
did
he
both
to
persians
and
allies
remaining
at
memphis
and
opening
ancient
tombs
and
examining
the
dead
bodies
likewise
also
he
entered
into
the
temple
of
hephaistos
and
very
much
derided
the
image
of
the
god
for
the
image
of
hephaistos
very
nearly
resembles
the
phenician
pataicoi
which
the
phenicians
carry
about
on
the
prows
of
their
triremes
and
for
him
who
has
not
seen
these
i
will
indicate
its
nature
is
the
likeness
of
a
dwarfish
man
he
entered
also
into
the
temple
of
the
cabeiroi
into
which
it
is
not
lawful
for
any
one
to
enter
except
the
priest
only
and
the
images
there
he
even
set
on
fire
after
much
mockery
of
them
now
these
also
are
like
the
images
of
hephaistos
and
it
is
said
that
they
are
the
children
of
that
god
it
is
clear
to
me
therefore
by
every
kind
of
proof
that
cambyses
was
mad
exceedingly
for
otherwise
he
would
not
have
attempted
to
deride
religious
rites
and
customary
observances
for
if
one
should
propose
to
all
men
a
choice
bidding
them
select
the
best
customs
from
all
the
customs
that
there
are
each
race
of
men
after
examining
them
all
would
select
those
of
his
own
people
thus
all
think
that
their
own
customs
are
by
far
the
best
and
so
it
is
not
likely
that
any
but
a
madman
would
make
a
jest
of
such
things
now
of
the
fact
that
all
men
are
thus
wont
to
think
about
their
customs
we
may
judge
by
many
other
proofs
and
more
specially
by
this
which
follows
in
the
course
of
his
reign
summoned
those
of
the
hellenes
who
were
present
in
his
land
and
asked
them
for
what
price
they
would
consent
to
eat
up
their
fathers
when
they
died
and
they
answered
that
for
no
price
would
they
do
so
after
this
dareios
summoned
those
indians
who
are
called
callatians
who
eat
their
parents
and
asked
them
in
presence
of
the
hellenes
who
understood
what
they
said
by
help
of
an
interpreter
for
what
payment
they
would
consent
to
consume
with
fire
the
bodies
of
their
fathers
when
they
died
and
they
cried
out
aloud
and
bade
him
keep
silence
from
such
words
thus
then
these
things
are
established
by
usage
and
i
think
that
pindar
spoke
rightly
in
his
verse
when
he
said
that
of
all
things
law
is
king
now
while
cambyses
was
marching
upon
egypt
the
lacedemonians
also
had
made
an
expedition
against
samos
and
against
polycrates
the
son
of
aiakes
who
had
risen
against
the
government
and
obtained
rule
over
samos
at
first
he
had
divided
the
state
into
three
parts
and
had
given
a
share
to
his
brothers
pantagnotos
and
syloson
but
afterwards
he
put
to
death
one
of
these
and
the
younger
namely
syloson
he
drove
out
and
so
obtained
possession
of
the
whole
of
samos
then
being
in
possession
he
made
a
with
amasis
the
king
of
egypt
sending
him
gifts
and
receiving
gifts
in
return
from
him
after
this
straightway
within
a
short
period
of
time
the
power
of
polycrates
increased
rapidly
and
there
was
much
fame
of
it
not
only
in
ionia
but
also
over
the
rest
of
hellas
for
to
whatever
part
he
directed
his
forces
everything
went
fortunately
for
him
and
he
had
got
for
himself
a
hundred
galleys
and
a
thousand
archers
and
he
plundered
from
all
making
no
distinction
of
any
for
it
was
his
wont
to
say
that
he
would
win
more
gratitude
from
his
friend
by
giving
back
to
him
that
which
he
had
taken
than
by
not
taking
at
all
so
he
had
conquered
many
of
the
islands
and
also
many
cities
of
the
continent
and
besides
other
things
he
gained
the
victory
in
a
over
the
lesbians
as
they
were
coming
to
help
the
milesians
with
their
forces
and
conquered
them
these
men
dug
the
whole
trench
round
the
wall
of
the
city
of
samos
working
in
chains
now
amasis
as
may
be
supposed
did
not
fail
to
perceive
that
polycrates
was
very
greatly
fortunate
and
it
was
to
him
an
object
of
concern
and
as
much
more
good
fortune
yet
continued
to
come
to
polycrates
he
wrote
upon
a
paper
these
words
and
sent
them
to
samos
amasis
to
polycrates
thus
saith
is
a
pleasant
thing
indeed
to
hear
that
one
who
is
a
friend
and
guest
is
faring
well
yet
to
me
thy
great
good
fortune
is
not
pleasing
since
i
know
that
the
divinity
is
jealous
and
i
think
that
i
desire
both
for
myself
and
for
those
about
whom
i
have
care
that
in
some
of
our
affairs
we
should
be
prosperous
and
in
others
should
fail
and
thus
go
through
life
alternately
faring
well
and
ill
rather
than
that
we
should
be
prosperous
in
all
things
for
never
yet
did
i
hear
tell
of
any
one
who
was
prosperous
in
all
things
and
did
not
come
to
an
utterly
evil
end
at
the
last
now
therefore
do
thou
follow
my
counsel
and
act
as
i
shall
say
with
respect
to
thy
prosperous
fortunes
take
thought
and
consider
and
that
which
thou
findest
to
be
the
most
valued
by
thee
and
for
the
loss
of
which
thou
wilt
most
be
vexed
in
thy
soul
that
take
and
cast
away
in
such
a
manner
that
it
shall
never
again
come
to
the
sight
of
men
and
if
in
future
from
that
time
forward
good
fortune
does
not
befall
thee
in
alternation
with
calamities
apply
remedies
in
the
manner
by
me
suggested
polycrates
having
read
this
and
having
perceived
by
reflection
that
amasis
suggested
to
him
good
counsel
sought
to
find
which
one
of
his
treasures
he
would
be
most
afflicted
in
his
soul
to
lose
and
seeking
he
found
this
which
i
shall
say
had
a
signet
which
he
used
to
wear
enchased
in
gold
and
made
of
an
emerald
stone
and
it
was
the
work
of
theodoros
the
son
of
telecles
of
samos
seeing
then
that
he
thought
it
good
to
cast
this
away
he
did
thus
manned
a
galley
with
sailors
and
went
on
board
of
it
himself
and
then
he
bade
them
put
out
into
the
deep
sea
and
when
he
had
got
to
a
distance
from
the
island
he
took
off
the
and
in
the
sight
of
all
who
were
with
him
in
the
ship
he
threw
it
into
the
sea
thus
having
done
he
sailed
home
and
when
he
came
to
his
house
he
mourned
for
his
loss
but
on
the
fifth
or
sixth
day
after
these
things
it
happened
to
him
as
follows
fisherman
having
caught
a
large
and
beautiful
fish
thought
it
right
that
this
should
be
given
as
a
gift
to
polycrates
he
bore
it
therefore
to
the
door
of
the
palace
and
said
that
he
desired
to
come
into
the
presence
of
polycrates
and
when
he
had
obtained
this
he
gave
him
the
fish
saying
o
king
having
taken
this
fish
i
did
not
think
fit
to
bear
it
to
the
market
although
i
am
one
who
lives
by
the
labour
of
his
hands
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
worthy
of
thee
and
of
thy
monarchy
therefore
i
bring
it
and
present
it
to
thee
he
then
being
pleased
at
the
words
spoken
answered
thus
thou
didst
exceedingly
well
and
double
thanks
are
due
to
thee
for
thy
words
and
also
for
thy
gift
and
we
invite
thee
to
come
to
dinner
the
fisherman
then
thinking
this
a
great
thing
went
away
to
this
house
and
the
servants
as
they
were
cutting
up
the
fish
found
in
its
belly
the
of
polycrates
then
as
soon
as
they
had
seen
it
and
taken
it
up
they
bore
it
rejoicing
to
polycrates
and
giving
him
the
they
told
him
in
what
manner
it
had
been
found
and
he
perceiving
that
the
matter
was
of
god
wrote
upon
paper
all
that
he
had
done
and
all
that
had
happened
to
him
and
having
written
he
despatched
it
to
egypt
then
amasis
when
he
had
read
the
paper
which
had
come
from
polycrates
perceived
that
it
was
impossible
for
man
to
rescue
man
from
the
event
which
was
to
come
to
pass
and
that
polycrates
was
destined
not
to
have
a
good
end
being
prosperous
in
all
things
seeing
that
he
found
again
even
that
which
he
cast
away
therefore
he
sent
an
envoy
to
him
in
samos
and
said
that
he
broke
off
the
and
this
he
did
lest
when
a
fearful
and
great
mishap
befell
polycrates
he
might
himself
be
grieved
in
his
soul
as
for
a
man
who
was
his
guest
it
was
this
polycrates
then
prosperous
in
all
things
against
whom
the
lacedemonians
were
making
an
expedition
being
invited
by
those
samians
who
afterwards
settled
at
kydonia
in
crete
to
come
to
their
assistance
now
polycrates
had
sent
an
envoy
to
cambyses
the
son
of
cyrus
without
the
knowledge
of
the
samians
as
he
was
gathering
an
army
to
go
against
egypt
and
had
asked
him
to
send
to
him
in
samos
and
to
ask
for
an
armed
force
so
cambyses
hearing
this
very
readily
sent
to
samos
to
ask
polycrates
to
send
a
naval
force
with
him
against
egypt
and
polycrates
selected
of
the
citizens
those
whom
he
most
suspected
of
desiring
to
rise
against
him
and
sent
them
away
in
forty
triremes
charging
cambyses
not
to
send
them
back
now
some
say
that
those
of
the
samians
who
were
sent
away
by
polycrates
never
reached
egypt
but
when
they
arrived
on
their
voyage
at
carpathos
they
considered
with
themselves
and
resolved
not
to
sail
on
any
further
others
say
that
they
reached
egypt
and
being
kept
under
guard
there
they
made
their
escape
from
thence
then
as
they
were
sailing
in
to
samos
polycrates
encountered
them
with
ships
and
engaged
battle
with
them
and
those
who
were
returning
home
had
the
better
and
landed
in
the
island
but
having
fought
a
in
the
island
they
were
worsted
and
so
sailed
to
lacedemon
some
however
say
that
those
from
egypt
defeated
polycrates
in
the
battle
but
this
in
my
opinion
is
not
correct
for
there
would
have
been
no
need
for
them
to
invite
the
assistance
of
the
lacedemonians
if
they
had
been
able
by
themselves
to
bring
polycrates
to
terms
moreover
it
is
not
reasonable
either
seeing
that
he
had
foreign
mercenaries
and
native
archers
very
many
in
number
to
suppose
that
he
was
worsted
by
the
returning
samians
who
were
but
few
then
polycrates
gathered
together
the
children
and
wives
of
his
subjects
and
confined
them
in
the
keeping
them
ready
so
that
if
it
should
prove
that
his
subjects
deserted
to
the
side
of
the
returning
exiles
he
might
burn
them
with
the
sheds
when
those
of
the
samians
who
had
been
driven
out
by
polycrates
reached
sparta
they
were
introduced
before
the
magistrates
and
spoke
at
length
being
urgent
in
their
request
the
magistrates
however
at
the
first
introduction
replied
that
they
had
forgotten
the
things
which
had
been
spoken
at
the
beginning
and
did
not
understand
those
which
were
spoken
at
the
end
after
this
they
were
introduced
a
second
time
and
bringing
with
them
a
bag
they
said
nothing
else
but
this
namely
that
the
bag
was
in
want
of
meal
to
which
the
others
replied
that
they
had
overdone
it
with
the
bag
however
they
resolved
to
help
them
then
the
lacedemonians
prepared
a
force
and
made
expedition
to
samos
in
repayment
of
former
services
as
the
samians
say
because
the
samians
had
first
helped
them
with
ships
against
the
messenians
but
the
lacedemonians
say
that
they
made
the
expedition
not
so
much
from
desire
to
help
the
samians
at
their
request
as
to
take
vengeance
on
their
own
behalf
for
the
robbery
of
the
which
they
had
been
bearing
as
a
gift
to
croesus
and
of
the
corslet
which
amasis
the
king
of
egypt
had
sent
as
a
gift
to
them
for
the
samians
had
carried
off
the
corslet
also
in
the
year
before
they
took
the
bowl
and
it
was
of
linen
with
many
figures
woven
into
it
and
embroidered
with
gold
and
with
cotton
and
each
thread
of
this
corslet
is
worthy
of
admiration
for
that
being
itself
fine
it
has
in
it
three
hundred
and
sixty
fibres
all
plain
to
view
such
another
as
this
moreover
is
that
which
amasis
dedicated
as
an
offering
to
athene
at
lindos
the
corinthians
also
took
part
with
zeal
in
this
expedition
against
samos
that
it
might
be
carried
out
for
there
had
been
an
offence
perpetrated
against
them
also
by
the
samians
a
generation
before
the
time
of
this
expedition
and
about
the
same
time
as
the
robbery
of
the
bowl
periander
the
son
of
kypselos
had
despatched
three
hundred
sons
of
the
chief
men
of
corcyra
to
alyattes
at
sardis
to
be
made
eunuchs
and
when
the
corinthians
who
were
conducting
the
boys
had
put
in
to
samos
the
samians
being
informed
of
the
story
and
for
what
purpose
they
were
being
conducted
to
sardis
first
instructed
the
boys
to
lay
hold
of
the
temple
of
artemis
and
then
they
refused
to
permit
the
corinthians
to
drag
the
suppliants
away
from
the
temple
and
as
the
corinthians
cut
the
boys
off
from
supplies
of
food
the
samians
made
a
festival
which
they
celebrate
even
to
the
present
time
in
the
same
manner
for
when
night
came
on
as
long
as
the
boys
were
suppliants
they
arranged
dances
of
maidens
and
youths
and
in
arranging
the
dances
they
made
it
a
rule
of
the
festival
that
sweet
cakes
of
sesame
and
honey
should
be
carried
in
order
that
the
corcyrean
boys
might
snatch
them
and
so
have
support
and
this
went
on
so
long
that
at
last
the
corinthians
who
had
charge
of
the
boys
departed
and
went
away
and
as
for
the
boys
the
samians
carried
them
back
to
corcyra
now
if
after
the
death
of
periander
the
corinthians
had
been
on
friendly
terms
with
the
corcyreans
they
would
not
have
joined
in
the
expedition
against
samos
for
the
cause
which
has
been
mentioned
but
as
it
is
they
have
been
ever
at
variance
with
one
another
since
they
first
colonised
the
island
this
then
was
the
cause
why
the
corinthians
had
a
grudge
against
the
samians
now
periander
had
chosen
out
the
sons
of
the
chief
men
of
corcyra
and
was
sending
them
to
sardis
to
be
made
eunuchs
in
order
that
he
might
have
revenge
since
the
corcyreans
had
first
begun
the
offence
and
had
done
to
him
a
deed
of
reckless
wrong
for
after
periander
had
killed
his
wife
melissa
it
chanced
to
him
to
experience
another
misfortune
in
addition
to
that
which
had
happened
to
him
already
and
this
was
as
follows
had
by
melissa
two
sons
the
one
of
seventeen
and
the
other
of
eighteen
years
these
sons
their
mother
father
procles
who
was
despot
of
epidauros
sent
for
to
himself
and
kindly
entertained
as
was
to
be
expected
seeing
that
they
were
the
sons
of
his
own
daughter
and
when
he
was
sending
them
back
he
said
in
taking
leave
of
them
do
ye
know
boys
who
it
was
that
killed
your
mother
of
this
saying
the
elder
of
them
took
no
account
but
the
younger
whose
name
was
lycophron
was
grieved
so
greatly
at
hearing
it
that
when
he
reached
corinth
again
he
would
neither
address
his
father
nor
speak
to
him
when
his
father
would
have
conversed
with
him
nor
give
any
reply
when
he
asked
questions
regarding
him
as
the
murderer
of
his
mother
at
length
periander
being
enraged
with
his
son
drove
him
forth
out
of
his
house
and
having
driven
him
forth
he
asked
of
the
elder
son
what
his
mother
father
had
said
to
them
in
his
conversation
he
then
related
how
procles
had
received
them
in
a
kindly
manner
but
of
the
saying
which
he
had
uttered
when
he
parted
from
them
he
had
no
remembrance
since
he
had
taken
no
note
of
it
so
periander
said
that
it
could
not
be
but
that
he
had
suggested
to
them
something
and
urged
him
further
with
questions
and
he
after
that
remembered
and
told
of
this
also
then
periander
taking
note
of
it
and
not
desiring
to
show
any
indulgence
sent
a
messenger
to
those
with
whom
the
son
who
had
been
driven
forth
was
living
at
that
time
and
forbade
them
to
receive
him
into
their
houses
and
whenever
having
been
driven
away
from
one
house
he
came
to
another
he
was
driven
away
also
from
this
since
periander
threatened
those
who
received
him
and
commanded
them
to
exclude
him
and
so
being
driven
away
again
he
would
go
to
another
house
where
persons
lived
who
were
his
friends
and
they
perhaps
received
him
because
he
was
the
son
of
periander
notwithstanding
that
they
feared
at
last
periander
made
a
proclamation
that
whosoever
should
either
receive
him
into
their
houses
or
converse
with
him
should
be
bound
to
pay
a
fine
to
apollo
stating
the
amount
that
it
should
be
accordingly
by
reason
of
this
proclamation
no
one
was
willing
either
to
converse
with
him
or
to
receive
him
into
their
house
and
moreover
even
he
himself
did
not
think
it
fit
to
attempt
it
since
it
had
been
forbidden
but
he
lay
about
in
the
porticoes
enduring
exposure
and
on
the
fourth
day
after
this
periander
seeing
him
fallen
into
squalid
misery
and
starvation
felt
pity
for
him
and
abating
his
anger
he
approached
him
and
began
to
say
son
which
of
these
two
is
to
be
preferred
the
fortune
which
thou
dost
now
experience
and
possess
or
to
inherit
the
power
and
wealth
which
i
possess
now
by
being
submissive
to
thy
father
will
thou
however
being
my
son
and
the
prince
of
wealthy
corinth
didst
choose
nevertheless
the
life
of
a
vagabond
by
making
opposition
and
displaying
anger
against
him
with
whom
it
behoved
thee
least
to
deal
so
for
if
any
misfortune
happened
in
those
matters
for
which
cause
thou
hast
suspicion
against
me
this
has
happened
to
me
first
and
i
am
sharer
in
the
misfortune
more
than
others
inasmuch
as
i
did
the
deed
myself
do
thou
however
having
learnt
by
how
much
to
be
envied
is
better
than
to
be
pitied
and
at
the
same
time
what
a
grievous
thing
it
is
to
be
angry
against
thy
parents
and
against
those
who
are
stronger
than
thou
come
back
now
to
the
house
periander
with
these
words
endeavoured
to
restrain
him
but
he
answered
nothing
else
to
his
father
but
said
only
that
he
ought
to
pay
a
fine
to
the
god
for
having
come
to
speech
with
him
then
periander
perceiving
that
the
malady
of
his
son
was
hopeless
and
could
not
be
overcome
despatched
a
ship
to
corcyra
and
so
sent
him
away
out
of
his
sight
for
he
was
ruler
also
of
that
island
and
having
sent
him
away
periander
proceeded
to
make
war
against
his
procles
esteeming
him
most
to
blame
for
the
condition
in
which
he
was
and
he
took
epidauros
and
took
also
procles
himself
and
made
him
a
prisoner
when
however
as
time
went
on
periander
had
passed
his
prime
and
perceived
within
himself
that
he
was
no
longer
able
to
overlook
and
manage
the
government
of
the
state
he
sent
to
corcyra
and
summoned
lycophron
to
come
back
and
take
the
supreme
power
for
in
the
elder
of
his
sons
he
did
not
see
the
required
capacity
but
perceived
clearly
that
he
was
of
wits
too
dull
lycophron
however
did
not
deign
even
to
give
an
answer
to
the
bearer
of
his
message
then
periander
clinging
still
in
affection
to
the
youth
sent
to
him
next
his
own
daughter
the
sister
of
lycophron
supposing
that
he
would
yield
to
her
persuasion
more
than
to
that
of
others
and
she
arrived
there
and
spoke
to
him
thus
boy
dost
thou
desire
that
both
the
despotism
should
fall
to
others
and
also
the
substance
of
thy
father
carried
off
as
plunder
rather
than
that
thou
shouldest
return
back
and
possess
them
come
back
to
thy
home
cease
to
torment
thyself
pride
is
a
mischievous
possession
heal
not
evil
with
evil
many
prefer
that
which
is
reasonable
to
that
which
is
strictly
just
and
many
ere
now
in
seeking
the
things
of
their
mother
have
lost
the
things
of
their
father
despotism
is
an
insecure
thing
and
many
desire
it
moreover
he
is
now
an
old
man
and
past
his
prime
give
not
thy
good
things
unto
others
she
thus
said
to
him
the
most
persuasive
things
having
been
before
instructed
by
her
father
but
he
in
answer
said
that
he
would
never
come
to
corinth
so
long
as
he
heard
that
his
father
was
yet
alive
when
she
had
reported
this
periander
the
third
time
sent
an
envoy
and
said
that
he
desired
himself
to
come
to
corcyra
exhorting
lycophron
at
the
same
time
to
come
back
to
corinth
and
to
be
his
successor
on
the
throne
the
son
having
agreed
to
return
on
these
terms
periander
was
preparing
to
sail
to
corcyra
and
his
son
to
corinth
but
the
corcyreans
having
learnt
all
that
had
taken
place
put
the
young
man
to
death
in
order
that
periander
might
not
come
to
their
land
for
this
cause
it
was
that
periander
took
vengeance
on
those
of
corcyra
the
lacedemonians
then
had
come
with
a
great
armament
and
were
besieging
samos
and
having
made
an
attack
upon
the
wall
they
occupied
the
tower
which
stands
by
the
sea
in
the
suburb
of
the
city
but
afterwards
when
polycrates
came
up
to
the
rescue
with
a
large
body
they
were
driven
away
from
it
meanwhile
by
the
upper
tower
which
is
upon
the
ridge
of
the
mountain
there
had
come
out
to
the
fight
the
foreign
mercenaries
and
many
of
the
samians
themselves
and
these
stood
their
ground
against
the
lacedemonians
for
a
short
while
and
then
began
to
fly
backwards
and
the
lacedemonians
followed
and
were
slaying
them
now
if
the
lacedemonians
there
present
had
all
been
equal
on
that
day
to
archias
and
lycopas
samos
would
have
been
captured
for
archias
and
lycopas
alone
rushed
within
the
wall
together
with
the
flying
samians
and
being
shut
off
from
retreat
were
slain
within
the
city
of
the
samians
i
myself
moreover
had
converse
in
pitane
for
to
that
deme
he
belonged
with
the
third
in
descent
from
this
archias
another
archias
the
son
of
samios
the
son
of
archias
who
honoured
the
samians
of
all
strangers
most
and
not
only
so
but
he
said
that
his
own
father
had
been
called
samios
because
his
father
archias
had
died
by
a
glorious
death
in
samos
and
he
said
that
he
honoured
samians
because
his
grandfather
had
been
granted
a
public
funeral
by
the
samians
the
lacedemonians
then
when
they
had
been
besieging
samos
for
forty
days
and
their
affairs
made
no
progress
set
forth
to
return
to
peloponnesus
but
according
to
the
less
credible
account
which
has
been
put
abroad
of
these
matters
polycrates
struck
in
lead
a
quantity
of
a
certain
native
coin
and
having
gilded
the
coins
over
gave
them
to
the
lacedemonians
and
they
received
them
and
upon
that
set
forth
to
depart
this
was
the
first
expedition
which
the
lacedemonians
being
dorians
made
into
asia
those
of
the
samians
who
had
made
the
expedition
against
polycrates
themselves
also
sailed
away
when
the
lacedemonians
were
about
to
desert
them
and
came
to
siphnos
for
they
were
in
want
of
money
and
the
people
of
siphnos
were
then
at
their
greatest
height
of
prosperity
and
possessed
wealth
more
than
all
the
other
islanders
since
they
had
in
their
island
mines
of
gold
and
silver
so
that
there
is
a
treasury
dedicated
at
delphi
with
the
tithe
of
the
money
which
came
in
from
these
mines
and
furnished
in
a
manner
equal
to
the
wealthiest
of
these
treasuries
and
the
people
used
to
divide
among
themselves
the
money
which
came
in
from
the
mines
every
year
so
when
they
were
establishing
the
treasury
they
consulted
the
oracle
as
to
whether
their
present
prosperity
was
capable
of
remaining
with
them
for
a
long
time
and
the
pythian
prophetess
gave
them
this
reply
but
when
with
white
shall
be
shining
the
hall
of
the
city
in
siphnos
and
when
the
market
is
white
of
brow
one
wary
is
needed
then
to
beware
of
an
army
of
wood
and
a
herald
now
just
at
that
time
the
and
city
hall
of
the
siphnians
had
been
decorated
with
parian
marble
this
oracle
they
were
not
able
to
understand
either
then
at
first
or
when
the
samians
had
arrived
for
as
soon
as
the
samians
were
putting
in
to
siphnos
they
sent
one
of
their
ships
to
bear
envoys
to
the
city
now
in
old
times
all
ships
were
painted
with
red
and
this
was
that
which
the
pythian
prophetess
was
declaring
beforehand
to
the
siphnians
bidding
them
guard
against
the
army
of
wood
and
the
herald
the
messengers
accordingly
came
and
asked
the
siphnians
to
lend
them
ten
talents
and
as
they
refused
to
lend
to
them
the
samians
began
to
lay
waste
their
lands
so
when
they
were
informed
of
it
forthwith
the
siphnians
came
to
the
rescue
and
having
engaged
battle
with
them
were
defeated
and
many
of
them
were
cut
off
by
the
samians
and
shut
out
of
the
city
and
the
samians
after
this
imposed
upon
them
a
payment
of
a
hundred
talents
then
from
the
men
of
hermion
they
received
by
payment
of
money
the
island
of
hydrea
which
is
near
the
coast
of
peloponnese
and
they
gave
it
in
charge
to
the
troizenians
but
they
themselves
settled
at
kydonia
which
is
in
crete
not
sailing
thither
for
that
purpose
but
in
order
to
drive
the
zakynthians
out
of
the
island
here
they
remained
and
were
prosperous
for
five
years
so
much
so
that
they
were
the
builders
of
the
temples
which
are
now
existing
in
kydonia
and
also
of
the
house
of
dictyna
in
the
sixth
year
however
the
eginetans
together
with
the
cretans
conquered
them
in
a
and
brought
them
to
slavery
and
they
cut
off
the
prows
of
their
ships
which
were
shaped
like
boars
and
dedicated
them
in
the
temple
of
athene
in
egina
this
the
eginetans
did
because
they
had
a
grudge
against
the
samians
for
the
samians
had
first
made
expedition
against
egina
when
amphicrates
was
king
in
samos
and
had
done
much
hurt
to
the
eginetans
and
suffered
much
hurt
also
from
them
such
was
the
cause
of
this
event
and
about
the
samians
i
have
spoken
at
greater
length
because
they
have
three
works
which
are
greater
than
any
others
that
have
been
made
by
hellenes
first
a
passage
beginning
from
below
and
open
at
both
ends
dug
through
a
mountain
not
less
than
a
hundred
and
fifty
fathoms
in
height
the
length
of
the
passage
is
seven
furlongs
and
the
height
and
breadth
each
eight
feet
and
throughout
the
whole
of
it
another
passage
has
been
dug
twenty
cubits
in
depth
and
three
feet
in
breadth
through
which
the
water
is
conducted
and
comes
by
the
pipes
to
the
city
brought
from
an
abundant
spring
and
the
designer
of
this
work
was
a
megarian
eupalinos
the
son
of
naustrophos
this
is
one
of
the
three
and
the
second
is
a
mole
in
the
sea
about
the
harbour
going
down
to
a
depth
of
as
much
as
twenty
fathoms
and
the
length
of
the
mole
is
more
than
two
furlongs
the
third
work
which
they
have
executed
is
a
temple
larger
than
all
the
other
temples
of
which
we
know
of
this
the
first
designer
was
rhoicos
the
son
of
philes
a
native
of
samos
for
this
reason
i
have
spoken
at
greater
length
of
the
samians
now
while
cambyses
the
son
of
cyrus
was
spending
a
long
time
in
egypt
and
had
gone
out
of
his
right
mind
there
rose
up
against
him
two
brothers
magians
of
whom
the
one
had
been
left
behind
by
cambyses
as
caretaker
of
his
household
this
man
i
say
rose
up
against
him
perceiving
that
the
occurrence
of
the
death
of
smerdis
was
being
kept
secret
and
that
there
were
but
few
of
the
persians
who
were
aware
of
it
while
the
greater
number
believed
without
doubt
that
he
was
still
alive
therefore
he
endeavoured
to
obtain
the
kingdom
and
he
formed
his
plan
as
follows
had
a
brother
that
one
who
as
i
said
rose
up
with
him
against
cambyses
and
this
man
in
form
very
closely
resembled
smerdis
the
son
of
cyrus
whom
cambyses
had
slain
being
his
own
brother
he
was
like
smerdis
i
say
in
form
and
not
only
so
but
he
had
the
same
name
smerdis
having
persuaded
this
man
that
he
would
manage
everything
for
him
the
magian
patizeithes
brought
him
and
seated
him
upon
the
royal
throne
and
having
so
done
he
sent
heralds
about
to
the
various
provinces
and
among
others
one
to
the
army
in
egypt
to
proclaim
to
them
that
they
must
obey
smerdis
the
son
of
cyrus
for
the
future
instead
of
cambyses
so
then
the
other
heralds
made
this
proclamation
and
also
the
one
who
was
appointed
to
go
to
egypt
finding
cambyses
and
his
army
at
agbatana
in
syria
stood
in
the
midst
and
began
to
proclaim
that
which
had
been
commanded
to
him
by
the
magian
hearing
this
from
the
herald
and
supposing
that
the
herald
was
speaking
the
truth
and
that
he
had
himself
been
betrayed
by
prexaspes
that
is
to
say
that
when
prexaspes
was
sent
to
kill
smerdis
he
had
not
done
so
cambyses
looked
upon
prexaspes
and
said
prexaspes
was
it
thus
that
thou
didst
perform
for
me
the
thing
which
i
gave
over
to
thee
to
do
and
he
said
master
the
saying
is
not
true
that
smerdis
thy
brother
has
risen
up
against
thee
nor
that
thou
wilt
have
any
contention
arising
from
him
either
great
or
small
for
i
myself
having
done
that
which
thou
didst
command
me
to
do
buried
him
with
my
own
hands
if
therefore
the
dead
have
risen
again
to
life
then
thou
mayest
expect
that
astyages
also
the
mede
will
rise
up
against
thee
but
if
it
is
as
it
was
beforetime
there
is
no
fear
now
that
any
trouble
shall
spring
up
for
you
at
least
from
him
now
therefore
i
think
it
well
that
some
should
pursue
after
the
herald
and
examine
him
asking
from
whom
he
has
come
to
proclaim
to
us
that
we
are
to
obey
smerdis
as
king
when
prexaspes
had
thus
spoken
cambyses
was
pleased
with
the
advice
and
accordingly
the
herald
was
pursued
forthwith
and
returned
then
when
he
had
come
back
prexaspes
asked
him
as
follows
man
thou
sayest
that
thou
art
come
as
a
messenger
from
smerdis
the
son
of
cyrus
now
therefore
speak
the
truth
and
go
away
in
peace
i
ask
thee
whether
smerdis
himself
appeared
before
thine
eyes
and
charged
thee
to
say
this
or
some
one
of
those
who
serve
him
he
said
smerdis
the
son
of
cyrus
i
have
never
yet
seen
since
the
day
that
king
cambyses
marched
to
egypt
but
the
magian
whom
cambyses
appointed
to
be
guardian
of
his
household
he
i
say
gave
me
this
charge
saying
that
smerdis
the
son
of
cyrus
was
he
who
laid
the
command
upon
me
to
speak
these
things
to
you
thus
he
spoke
to
them
adding
no
falsehoods
to
the
first
and
cambyses
said
prexaspes
thou
hast
done
that
which
was
commanded
thee
like
an
honest
man
and
hast
escaped
censure
but
who
of
the
persians
may
this
be
who
has
risen
up
against
me
and
usurped
the
name
of
smerdis
he
said
i
seem
to
myself
o
king
to
have
understanding
of
this
which
has
come
to
pass
the
magians
have
risen
against
thee
patizeithes
namely
whom
thou
didst
leave
as
caretaker
of
thy
household
and
his
brother
smerdis
then
cambyses
when
he
heard
the
name
of
smerdis
perceived
at
once
the
true
meaning
of
this
report
and
of
the
dream
for
he
thought
in
his
sleep
that
some
one
had
reported
to
him
that
smerdis
was
sitting
upon
the
royal
throne
and
had
touched
the
heaven
with
his
head
and
perceiving
that
he
had
slain
his
brother
without
need
he
began
to
lament
for
smerdis
and
having
lamented
for
him
and
sorrowed
greatly
for
the
whole
mishap
he
was
leaping
upon
his
horse
meaning
as
quickly
as
possible
to
march
his
army
to
susa
against
the
magian
and
as
he
leapt
upon
his
horse
the
cap
of
his
fell
off
and
the
sword
being
left
bare
struck
his
thigh
having
been
wounded
then
in
the
same
part
where
he
had
formerly
struck
apis
the
god
of
the
egyptians
and
believing
that
he
had
been
struck
with
a
mortal
blow
cambyses
asked
what
was
the
name
of
that
town
and
they
said
agbatana
now
even
before
this
he
had
been
informed
by
the
oracle
at
the
city
of
buto
that
in
agbatana
he
should
bring
his
life
to
an
end
and
he
supposed
that
he
should
die
of
old
age
in
agbatana
in
media
where
was
his
chief
seat
of
power
but
the
oracle
it
appeared
meant
in
agbatana
of
syria
so
when
by
questioning
now
he
learnt
the
name
of
the
town
being
struck
with
fear
both
by
the
calamity
caused
by
the
magian
and
at
the
same
time
by
the
wound
he
came
to
his
right
mind
and
understanding
the
meaning
of
the
oracle
he
said
here
it
is
fated
that
cambyses
the
son
of
cyrus
shall
end
his
life
so
much
only
he
said
at
that
time
but
about
twenty
days
afterwards
he
sent
for
the
most
honourable
of
the
persians
who
were
with
him
and
said
to
them
as
follows
persians
it
has
become
necessary
for
me
to
make
known
to
you
the
thing
which
i
was
wont
to
keep
concealed
beyond
all
other
things
being
in
egypt
i
saw
a
vision
in
my
sleep
which
i
would
i
had
never
seen
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
a
messenger
came
from
home
and
reported
to
me
that
smerdis
was
sitting
upon
the
royal
throne
and
had
touched
the
heaven
with
his
head
fearing
then
lest
i
should
be
deprived
of
my
power
by
my
brother
i
acted
quickly
rather
than
wisely
for
it
seems
that
it
is
not
possible
for
man
to
avert
that
which
is
destined
to
come
to
pass
i
therefore
fool
that
i
was
sent
away
prexaspes
to
susa
to
kill
smerdis
and
when
this
great
evil
had
been
done
i
lived
in
security
never
considering
the
danger
that
some
other
man
might
at
some
time
rise
up
against
me
now
that
smerdis
had
been
removed
and
altogether
missing
the
mark
of
that
which
was
about
to
happen
i
have
both
made
myself
the
murderer
of
my
brother
when
there
was
no
need
and
i
have
been
deprived
none
the
less
of
the
kingdom
for
it
was
in
fact
smerdis
the
magian
of
whom
the
divine
power
declared
to
me
beforehand
in
the
vision
that
he
should
rise
up
against
me
so
then
as
i
say
this
deed
has
been
done
by
me
and
ye
must
imagine
that
ye
no
longer
have
smerdis
the
son
of
cyrus
alive
but
it
is
in
truth
the
magians
who
are
masters
of
your
kingdom
he
whom
i
left
as
guardian
of
my
household
and
his
brother
smerdis
the
man
then
who
ought
above
all
others
to
have
taken
vengeance
on
my
behalf
for
the
dishonour
which
i
have
suffered
from
the
magians
has
ended
his
life
by
an
unholy
death
received
from
the
hands
of
those
who
were
his
nearest
of
kin
and
since
he
is
no
more
it
becomes
most
needful
for
me
as
the
thing
next
best
of
those
which
remain
to
charge
you
o
persians
with
that
which
dying
i
desire
should
be
done
for
me
this
then
i
lay
upon
you
calling
upon
the
gods
of
the
royal
house
to
witness
it
you
and
most
of
all
upon
those
of
the
achaemenidai
who
are
present
here
ye
do
not
permit
the
return
of
the
chief
power
to
the
medes
but
that
if
they
have
acquired
it
by
craft
by
craft
they
be
deprived
of
it
by
you
or
if
they
have
conquered
it
by
any
kind
of
force
by
force
and
by
a
strong
hand
ye
recover
it
and
if
ye
do
this
may
the
earth
bring
forth
her
produce
and
may
your
wives
and
your
cattle
be
fruitful
while
ye
remain
free
for
ever
but
if
ye
do
not
recover
the
power
nor
attempt
to
recover
it
i
pray
that
curses
the
contrary
of
these
blessings
may
come
upon
you
and
moreover
that
each
man
of
the
persians
may
have
an
end
to
his
life
like
that
which
has
come
upon
me
then
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
speaking
these
things
cambyses
began
to
bewail
and
make
lamentation
for
all
his
fortunes
and
the
persians
when
they
saw
that
the
king
had
begun
to
bewail
himself
both
rent
the
garments
which
they
wore
and
made
lamentation
without
stint
after
this
when
the
bone
had
become
diseased
and
the
thigh
had
mortified
cambyses
the
son
of
cyrus
was
carried
off
by
the
wound
having
reigned
in
all
seven
years
and
five
months
and
being
absolutely
childless
both
of
male
and
female
offspring
the
persians
meanwhile
who
were
present
there
were
very
little
disposed
to
believe
that
the
power
was
in
the
hands
of
the
magians
on
the
contrary
they
were
surely
convinced
that
cambyses
had
said
that
which
he
said
about
the
death
of
smerdis
to
deceive
them
in
order
that
all
the
persians
might
be
moved
to
war
against
him
these
then
were
surely
convinced
that
smerdis
the
son
of
cyrus
was
established
to
be
king
for
prexaspes
also
very
strongly
denied
that
he
had
slain
smerdis
since
it
was
not
safe
now
that
cambyses
was
dead
for
him
to
say
that
he
had
destroyed
with
his
own
hand
the
son
of
cyrus
thus
when
cambyses
had
brought
his
life
to
an
end
the
magian
became
king
without
disturbance
usurping
the
place
of
his
namesake
smerdis
the
son
of
cyrus
and
he
reigned
during
the
seven
months
which
were
wanting
yet
to
cambyses
for
the
completion
of
the
eight
years
and
during
them
he
performed
acts
of
great
benefit
to
all
his
subjects
so
that
after
his
death
all
those
in
asia
except
the
persians
themselves
mourned
for
his
loss
for
the
magian
sent
messengers
abroad
to
every
nation
over
which
he
ruled
and
proclaimed
freedom
from
military
service
and
from
tribute
for
three
years
this
proclamation
i
say
he
made
at
once
when
he
established
himself
upon
the
throne
but
in
the
eighth
month
it
was
discovered
who
he
was
in
the
following
manner
was
one
otanes
the
son
of
pharnaspes
in
birth
and
in
wealth
not
inferior
to
any
of
the
persians
this
otanes
was
the
first
who
had
had
suspicion
of
the
magian
that
he
was
not
smerdis
the
son
of
cyrus
but
the
person
that
he
really
was
drawing
his
inference
from
these
facts
namely
that
he
never
went
abroad
out
of
the
fortress
and
that
he
did
not
summon
into
his
presence
any
of
the
honourable
men
among
the
persians
and
having
formed
a
suspicion
of
him
he
proceeded
to
do
as
follows
had
taken
to
wife
his
daughter
whose
name
was
phaidyme
and
this
same
daughter
the
magian
at
that
time
was
keeping
as
his
wife
and
living
with
her
as
with
all
the
rest
also
of
the
wives
of
cambyses
otanes
therefore
sent
a
message
to
this
daughter
and
asked
her
who
the
man
was
by
whose
side
she
slept
whether
smerdis
the
son
of
cyrus
or
some
other
she
sent
back
word
to
him
saying
that
she
did
not
know
for
she
had
never
seen
smerdis
the
son
of
cyrus
nor
did
she
know
otherwise
who
he
was
who
lived
with
her
otanes
then
sent
a
second
time
and
said
if
thou
dost
not
thyself
know
smerdis
the
son
of
cyrus
then
do
thou
ask
of
atossa
who
this
man
is
with
whom
both
she
and
thou
live
as
wives
for
assuredly
it
must
be
that
she
knows
her
own
brother
to
this
the
daughter
sent
back
word
i
am
not
able
either
to
come
to
speech
with
atossa
or
to
see
any
other
of
the
women
who
live
here
with
me
for
as
soon
as
this
man
whosoever
he
may
be
succeeded
to
the
kingdom
he
separated
us
and
placed
us
in
different
apartments
by
ourselves
when
otanes
heard
this
the
matter
became
more
and
more
clear
to
him
and
he
sent
another
message
in
to
her
which
said
daughter
it
is
right
for
thee
nobly
born
as
thou
art
to
undertake
any
risk
which
thy
father
bids
thee
take
upon
thee
for
if
in
truth
this
is
not
smerdis
the
son
of
cyrus
but
the
man
whom
i
suppose
he
ought
not
to
escape
with
impunity
either
for
taking
thee
to
his
bed
or
for
holding
the
dominion
of
persians
but
he
must
pay
the
penalty
now
therefore
do
as
i
say
when
he
sleeps
by
thee
and
thou
perceivest
that
he
is
sound
asleep
feel
his
ears
and
if
it
prove
that
he
has
ears
then
believe
that
thou
art
living
with
smerdis
the
son
of
cyrus
but
if
not
believe
that
it
is
with
the
magian
smerdis
to
this
phaidyme
sent
an
answer
saying
that
if
she
should
do
so
she
would
run
a
great
risk
for
supposing
that
he
should
chance
not
to
have
his
ears
and
she
were
detected
feeling
for
them
she
was
well
assured
that
he
would
put
her
to
death
but
nevertheless
she
would
do
this
so
she
undertook
to
do
this
for
her
father
but
as
for
this
magian
smerdis
he
had
had
his
ears
cut
off
by
cyrus
the
son
of
cambyses
when
he
was
king
for
some
grave
offence
this
phaidyme
then
the
daughter
of
otanes
proceeding
to
perform
all
that
she
had
undertaken
for
her
father
when
her
turn
came
to
go
to
the
magian
for
the
wives
of
the
persians
go
in
to
them
regularly
each
in
her
turn
came
and
lay
down
beside
him
and
when
the
magian
was
in
deep
sleep
she
felt
his
ears
and
perceiving
not
with
difficulty
but
easily
that
her
husband
had
no
ears
so
soon
as
it
became
day
she
sent
and
informed
her
father
of
that
which
had
taken
place
then
otanes
took
to
him
aspathines
and
gobryas
who
were
leading
men
among
the
persians
and
also
his
own
most
trusted
friends
and
related
to
them
the
whole
matter
and
they
as
it
then
appeared
had
suspicions
also
themselves
that
it
was
so
and
when
otanes
reported
this
to
them
they
readily
accepted
his
proposals
then
it
was
resolved
by
them
that
each
one
should
associate
with
himself
that
man
of
the
persians
whom
he
trusted
most
so
otanes
brought
in
intaphrenes
gobryas
brought
in
megabyzos
and
aspathines
brought
in
hydarnes
when
they
had
thus
become
six
dareios
the
son
of
hystaspes
arrived
at
susa
having
come
from
the
land
of
persia
for
of
this
his
father
was
governor
accordingly
when
he
came
the
six
men
of
the
persians
resolved
to
associate
dareios
also
with
themselves
these
then
having
come
together
being
seven
in
number
gave
pledges
of
faith
to
one
another
and
deliberated
together
and
when
it
came
to
dareios
to
declare
his
opinion
he
spoke
to
them
as
follows
i
thought
that
i
alone
knew
this
namely
that
it
was
the
magian
who
was
reigning
as
king
and
that
smerdis
the
son
of
cyrus
had
brought
his
life
to
an
end
and
for
this
very
reason
i
am
come
with
earnest
purpose
to
contrive
death
for
the
magian
since
however
it
has
come
to
pass
that
ye
also
know
and
not
i
alone
i
think
it
well
to
act
at
once
and
not
to
put
the
matter
off
for
that
is
not
the
better
way
to
this
replied
otanes
son
of
hystaspes
thou
art
the
scion
of
a
noble
stock
and
thou
art
showing
thyself
as
it
seems
in
no
way
inferior
to
thy
father
do
not
however
hasten
this
enterprise
so
much
without
consideration
but
take
it
up
more
prudently
for
we
must
first
become
more
in
numbers
and
then
undertake
the
matter
in
answer
to
this
dareios
said
men
who
are
here
present
if
ye
shall
follow
the
way
suggested
by
otanes
know
that
ye
will
perish
miserably
for
some
one
will
carry
word
to
the
magian
getting
gain
thereby
privately
for
himself
your
best
way
would
have
been
to
do
this
action
upon
your
own
risk
alone
but
since
it
seemed
good
to
you
to
refer
the
matter
to
a
greater
number
and
ye
communicated
it
to
me
either
let
us
do
the
deed
or
be
ye
assured
that
if
this
present
day
shall
pass
by
none
other
shall
prevent
me
as
your
accuser
but
i
will
myself
tell
these
things
to
the
magian
to
this
otanes
when
he
saw
dareios
in
violent
haste
replied
since
thou
dost
compel
us
to
hasten
the
matter
and
dost
not
permit
us
to
delay
come
expound
to
us
thyself
in
what
manner
we
shall
pass
into
the
palace
and
lay
hands
upon
them
for
that
there
are
guards
set
in
various
parts
thou
knowest
probably
thyself
as
well
as
we
if
not
from
sight
at
least
from
hearsay
and
in
what
manner
shall
we
pass
through
these
dareios
made
reply
with
these
words
otanes
there
are
many
things
in
sooth
which
it
is
not
possible
to
set
forth
in
speech
but
only
in
deed
and
other
things
there
are
which
in
speech
can
be
set
forth
but
from
them
comes
no
famous
deed
know
ye
however
that
the
guards
which
are
set
are
not
difficult
to
pass
for
in
the
first
place
we
being
what
we
are
there
is
no
one
who
will
not
let
us
go
by
partly
as
may
be
supposed
from
having
respect
for
us
and
partly
also
perhaps
from
fear
and
secondly
i
have
myself
a
most
specious
pretext
by
means
of
which
we
may
pass
by
for
i
shall
say
that
i
am
just
now
come
from
the
persian
land
and
desire
to
declare
to
the
king
a
certain
message
from
my
father
for
where
it
is
necessary
that
a
lie
be
spoken
let
it
be
spoken
seeing
that
we
all
aim
at
the
same
object
both
they
who
lie
and
they
who
always
speak
the
truth
those
lie
whenever
they
are
likely
to
gain
anything
by
persuading
with
their
lies
and
these
tell
the
truth
in
order
that
they
may
draw
to
themselves
gain
by
the
truth
and
that
things
may
be
entrusted
to
them
more
readily
thus
while
practising
different
ways
we
aim
all
at
the
same
thing
if
however
they
were
not
likely
to
make
any
gain
by
it
the
would
lie
and
the
liar
would
speak
the
truth
with
indifference
whosoever
then
of
the
shall
let
us
pass
by
of
his
own
free
will
for
him
it
shall
be
the
better
afterwards
but
whosoever
shall
endeavour
to
oppose
our
passage
let
him
then
and
there
be
marked
as
our
enemy
and
after
that
let
us
push
in
and
set
about
our
work
then
said
gobryas
friends
at
what
time
will
there
be
a
fairer
opportunity
for
us
either
to
recover
our
rule
or
if
we
are
not
able
to
get
it
again
to
die
seeing
that
we
being
persians
on
the
one
hand
lie
under
the
rule
of
a
mede
a
magian
and
that
too
a
man
whose
ears
have
been
cut
off
moreover
all
those
of
you
who
stood
by
the
side
of
cambyses
when
he
was
sick
remember
assuredly
what
he
laid
upon
the
persians
as
he
was
bringing
his
life
to
an
end
if
they
should
not
attempt
to
win
back
the
power
and
this
we
did
not
accept
then
but
supposed
that
cambyses
had
spoken
in
order
to
deceive
us
now
therefore
i
give
my
vote
that
we
follow
the
opinion
of
dareios
and
that
we
do
not
depart
from
this
assembly
to
go
anywhither
else
but
straight
to
attack
the
magian
thus
spoke
gobryas
and
they
all
approved
of
this
proposal
now
while
these
were
thus
taking
counsel
together
it
was
coming
to
pass
by
coincidence
as
follows
magians
taking
counsel
together
had
resolved
to
join
prexaspes
with
themselves
as
a
friend
both
because
he
had
suffered
grievous
wrong
from
cambyses
who
had
killed
his
son
by
shooting
him
and
because
he
alone
knew
for
a
certainty
of
the
death
of
smerdis
the
son
of
cyrus
having
killed
him
with
his
own
hands
and
finally
because
prexaspes
was
in
very
great
repute
among
the
persians
for
these
reasons
they
summoned
him
and
endeavoured
to
win
him
to
be
their
friend
engaging
him
by
pledge
and
with
oaths
that
he
would
assuredly
keep
to
himself
and
not
reveal
to
any
man
the
deception
which
had
been
practised
by
them
upon
the
persians
and
promising
to
give
him
things
innumerable
in
return
after
prexaspes
had
promised
to
do
this
the
magians
having
persuaded
him
so
far
proposed
to
him
a
second
thing
and
said
that
they
would
call
together
all
the
persians
to
come
up
to
the
wall
of
the
palace
and
bade
him
go
up
upon
a
tower
and
address
them
saying
that
they
were
living
under
the
rule
of
smerdis
the
son
of
cyrus
and
no
other
this
they
so
enjoined
because
they
supposed
that
he
had
the
greatest
credit
among
the
persians
and
because
he
had
frequently
declared
the
opinion
that
smerdis
the
son
of
cyrus
was
still
alive
and
had
denied
that
he
had
slain
him
when
prexaspes
said
that
he
was
ready
to
do
this
also
the
magians
having
called
together
the
persians
caused
him
to
go
up
upon
a
tower
and
bade
him
address
them
then
he
chose
to
forget
those
things
which
they
asked
of
him
and
beginning
with
achaimenes
he
traced
the
descent
of
cyrus
on
the
father
side
and
then
when
he
came
down
to
cyrus
he
related
at
last
what
great
benefits
he
had
conferred
upon
the
persians
and
having
gone
through
this
recital
he
proceeded
to
declare
the
truth
saying
that
formerly
he
kept
it
secret
since
it
was
not
safe
for
him
to
tell
of
that
which
had
been
done
but
at
the
present
time
he
was
compelled
to
make
it
known
he
proceeded
to
say
how
he
had
himself
slain
smerdis
the
son
of
cyrus
being
compelled
by
cambyses
and
that
it
was
the
magians
who
were
now
ruling
then
he
made
imprecation
of
many
evils
on
the
persians
if
they
did
not
win
back
again
the
power
and
take
vengeance
upon
the
magians
and
upon
that
he
let
himself
fall
down
from
the
tower
head
foremost
thus
prexaspes
ended
his
life
having
been
throughout
his
time
a
man
of
repute
now
the
seven
of
the
persians
when
they
had
resolved
forthwith
to
lay
hands
upon
the
magians
and
not
to
delay
made
prayer
to
the
gods
and
went
knowing
nothing
of
that
which
had
been
done
with
regard
to
prexaspes
and
as
they
were
going
and
were
in
the
middle
of
their
course
they
heard
that
which
had
happened
about
prexaspes
upon
that
they
retired
out
of
the
way
and
again
considered
with
themselves
otanes
and
his
supporters
strongly
urging
that
they
should
delay
and
not
set
to
the
work
when
things
were
thus
disturbed
while
dareios
and
those
of
his
party
urged
that
they
should
go
forthwith
and
do
that
which
had
been
resolved
and
not
delay
then
while
they
were
contending
there
appeared
seven
pairs
of
hawks
pursuing
two
pairs
of
vultures
plucking
out
their
feathers
and
tearing
them
seeing
this
the
seven
all
approved
the
opinion
of
dareios
and
thereupon
they
went
to
the
king
palace
encouraged
by
the
sight
of
the
birds
when
they
appeared
at
the
gates
it
happened
nearly
as
dareios
supposed
for
the
guards
having
respect
for
men
who
were
chief
among
the
persians
and
not
suspecting
that
anything
would
be
done
by
them
of
the
kind
proposed
allowed
them
to
pass
in
under
the
guiding
of
heaven
and
none
asked
them
any
question
then
when
they
had
passed
into
the
court
they
met
the
eunuchs
who
bore
in
the
messages
to
the
king
and
these
inquired
of
them
for
what
purpose
they
had
come
and
at
the
same
time
they
threatened
with
punishment
the
keepers
of
the
gates
for
having
let
them
pass
in
and
tried
to
stop
the
seven
when
they
attempted
to
go
forward
then
they
gave
the
word
to
one
another
and
drawing
their
daggers
stabbed
these
men
there
upon
the
spot
who
tried
to
stop
them
and
themselves
went
running
on
towards
the
chamber
of
the
men
now
the
magians
happened
both
of
them
to
be
there
within
consulting
about
that
which
had
been
done
by
prexaspes
so
when
they
saw
that
the
eunuchs
had
been
attacked
and
were
crying
aloud
they
ran
back
both
of
them
and
perceiving
that
which
was
being
done
they
turned
to
and
one
of
them
got
down
his
bow
and
arrows
before
he
was
attacked
while
the
other
had
recourse
to
his
spear
then
they
engaged
in
combat
with
one
another
and
that
one
of
them
who
had
taken
up
his
bow
and
arrows
found
them
of
no
use
since
his
enemies
were
close
at
hand
and
pressed
hard
upon
him
but
the
other
defended
himself
with
his
spear
and
first
he
struck
aspathines
in
the
thigh
and
then
intaphrenes
in
the
eye
and
intaphrenes
lost
his
eye
by
reason
of
the
wound
but
his
life
he
did
not
lose
these
then
were
wounded
by
one
of
the
magians
but
the
other
when
his
bow
and
arrows
proved
useless
to
him
fled
into
a
bedchamber
which
opened
into
the
chamber
of
the
men
intending
to
close
the
door
and
with
him
there
rushed
in
two
of
the
seven
dareios
and
gobryas
and
when
gobryas
was
locked
together
in
combat
with
the
magian
dareios
stood
by
and
was
at
a
loss
what
to
do
because
it
was
dark
and
he
was
afraid
lest
he
should
strike
gobryas
then
seeing
him
standing
by
idle
gobryas
asked
why
he
did
not
use
his
hands
and
he
said
because
i
am
afraid
lest
i
may
strike
thee
and
gobryas
answered
thrust
with
thy
sword
even
though
it
stab
through
us
both
so
dareios
was
persuaded
and
he
thrust
with
his
danger
and
happened
to
hit
the
magian
so
when
they
had
slain
the
magians
and
cut
off
their
heads
they
left
behind
those
of
their
number
who
were
wounded
both
because
they
were
unable
to
go
and
also
in
order
that
they
might
take
charge
of
the
fortress
and
the
five
others
taking
with
them
the
heads
of
the
magians
ran
with
shouting
and
clashing
of
arms
and
called
upon
the
other
persians
to
join
them
telling
them
of
that
which
had
been
done
and
showing
the
heads
and
at
the
same
time
they
proceeded
to
slay
every
one
of
the
magians
who
crossed
their
path
so
the
persians
when
they
heard
of
that
which
had
been
brought
to
pass
by
the
seven
and
of
the
deceit
of
the
magians
thought
good
themselves
also
to
do
the
same
and
drawing
their
daggers
they
killed
the
magians
wherever
they
found
one
so
that
if
night
had
not
come
on
and
stopped
them
they
would
not
have
left
a
single
magian
alive
this
day
the
persians
celebrate
in
common
more
than
all
other
days
and
upon
it
they
keep
a
great
festival
which
is
called
by
the
persians
the
festival
of
the
slaughter
of
the
magians
on
which
no
magian
is
permitted
to
appear
abroad
but
the
magians
keep
themselves
within
their
houses
throughout
that
day
when
the
tumult
had
subsided
and
more
than
five
days
had
elapsed
those
who
had
risen
against
the
magians
began
to
take
counsel
about
the
general
state
and
there
were
spoken
speeches
which
some
of
the
hellenes
do
not
believe
were
really
uttered
but
spoken
they
were
nevertheless
on
the
one
hand
otanes
urged
that
they
should
resign
the
government
into
the
hands
of
the
whole
body
of
the
persians
and
his
words
were
as
follows
to
me
it
seems
best
that
no
single
one
of
us
should
henceforth
be
ruler
for
that
is
neither
pleasant
nor
profitable
ye
saw
the
insolent
temper
of
cambyses
to
what
lengths
it
went
and
ye
have
had
experience
also
of
the
insolence
of
the
magian
and
how
should
the
rule
of
one
alone
be
a
thing
seeing
that
the
monarch
may
do
what
he
desires
without
rendering
any
account
of
his
acts
even
the
best
of
all
men
if
he
were
placed
in
this
disposition
would
be
caused
by
it
to
change
from
his
wonted
disposition
for
insolence
is
engendered
in
him
by
the
good
things
which
he
possesses
and
envy
is
implanted
in
man
from
the
beginning
and
having
these
two
things
he
has
all
vice
for
he
does
many
deeds
of
reckless
wrong
partly
moved
by
insolence
proceeding
from
satiety
and
partly
by
envy
and
yet
a
despot
at
least
ought
to
have
been
free
from
envy
seeing
that
he
has
all
manner
of
good
things
he
is
however
naturally
in
just
the
opposite
temper
towards
his
subjects
for
he
grudges
to
the
nobles
that
they
should
survive
and
live
but
delights
in
the
basest
of
citizens
and
he
is
more
ready
than
any
other
man
to
receive
calumnies
then
of
all
things
he
is
the
most
inconsistent
for
if
you
express
admiration
of
him
moderately
he
is
offended
that
no
very
great
court
is
paid
to
him
whereas
if
you
pay
court
to
him
extravagantly
he
is
offended
with
you
for
being
a
flatterer
and
the
most
important
matter
of
all
is
that
which
i
am
about
to
say
disturbs
the
customs
handed
down
from
our
fathers
he
is
a
ravisher
of
women
and
he
puts
men
to
death
without
trial
on
the
other
hand
the
rule
of
many
has
first
a
name
attaching
to
it
which
is
the
fairest
of
all
names
that
is
to
say
next
the
multitude
does
none
of
those
things
which
the
monarch
does
offices
of
state
are
exercised
by
lot
and
the
magistrates
are
compelled
to
render
account
of
their
action
and
finally
all
matters
of
deliberation
are
referred
to
the
public
assembly
i
therefore
give
as
my
opinion
that
we
let
monarchy
go
and
increase
the
power
of
the
multitude
for
in
the
many
is
contained
everything
this
was
the
opinion
expressed
by
otanes
but
megabyzos
urged
that
they
should
entrust
matters
to
the
rule
of
a
few
saying
these
words
that
which
otanes
said
in
opposition
to
a
tyranny
let
it
be
counted
as
said
for
me
also
but
in
that
which
he
said
urging
that
we
should
make
over
the
power
to
the
multitude
he
has
missed
the
best
counsel
for
nothing
is
more
senseless
or
insolent
than
a
worthless
crowd
and
for
men
flying
from
the
insolence
of
a
despot
to
fall
into
that
of
unrestrained
popular
power
is
by
no
means
to
be
endured
for
he
if
he
does
anything
does
it
knowing
what
he
does
but
the
people
can
not
even
know
for
how
can
that
know
which
has
neither
been
taught
anything
noble
by
others
nor
perceived
anything
of
itself
but
pushes
on
matters
with
violent
impulse
and
without
understanding
like
a
torrent
stream
rule
of
the
people
then
let
them
adopt
who
are
foes
to
the
persians
but
let
us
choose
a
company
of
the
best
men
and
to
them
attach
the
chief
power
for
in
the
number
of
these
we
shall
ourselves
also
be
and
it
is
likely
that
the
resolutions
taken
by
the
best
men
will
be
the
best
this
was
the
opinion
expressed
by
megabyzos
and
thirdly
dareios
proceeded
to
declare
his
opinion
saying
to
me
it
seems
that
in
those
things
which
megabyzos
said
with
regard
to
the
multitude
he
spoke
rightly
but
in
those
which
he
said
with
regard
to
the
rule
of
a
few
not
rightly
for
whereas
there
are
three
things
set
before
us
and
each
is
supposed
to
be
the
best
in
its
own
kind
that
is
to
say
a
good
popular
government
and
the
rule
of
a
few
and
thirdly
the
rule
of
one
i
say
that
this
last
is
by
far
superior
to
the
others
for
nothing
better
can
be
found
than
the
rule
of
an
individual
man
of
the
best
kind
seeing
that
using
the
best
judgment
he
would
be
guardian
of
the
multitude
without
reproach
and
resolutions
directed
against
enemies
would
so
best
be
kept
secret
in
an
oligarchy
however
it
happens
often
that
many
while
practising
virtue
with
regard
to
the
commonwealth
have
strong
private
enmities
arising
among
themselves
for
as
each
man
desires
to
be
himself
the
leader
and
to
prevail
in
counsels
they
come
to
great
enmities
with
one
another
whence
arise
factions
among
them
and
out
of
the
factions
comes
murder
and
from
murder
results
the
rule
of
one
man
and
thus
it
is
shown
in
this
instance
by
how
much
that
is
the
best
again
when
the
people
rules
it
is
impossible
that
corruption
should
not
arise
and
when
corruption
arises
in
the
commonwealth
there
arise
among
the
corrupt
men
not
enmities
but
strong
ties
of
friendship
for
they
who
are
acting
corruptly
to
the
injury
of
the
commonwealth
put
their
heads
together
secretly
to
do
so
and
this
continues
so
until
at
last
some
one
takes
the
leadership
of
the
people
and
stops
the
course
of
such
men
by
reason
of
this
the
man
of
whom
i
speak
is
admired
by
the
people
and
being
so
admired
he
suddenly
appears
as
monarch
thus
he
too
furnishes
herein
an
example
to
prove
that
the
rule
of
one
is
the
best
thing
finally
to
sum
up
all
in
a
single
word
whence
arose
the
liberty
which
we
possess
and
who
gave
it
to
us
was
it
a
gift
of
the
people
or
of
an
oligarchy
or
of
a
monarch
i
therefore
am
of
opinion
that
we
having
been
set
free
by
one
man
should
preserve
that
form
of
rule
and
in
other
respects
also
that
we
should
not
annul
the
customs
of
our
fathers
which
are
ordered
well
for
that
is
not
the
better
way
these
three
opinions
then
had
been
proposed
and
the
other
four
men
of
the
seven
gave
their
assent
to
the
last
so
when
otanes
who
was
desirous
to
give
equality
to
the
persians
found
his
opinion
defeated
he
spoke
to
those
assembled
thus
partisans
it
is
clear
that
some
one
of
us
must
become
king
selected
either
by
casting
lots
or
by
entrusting
the
decision
to
the
multitude
of
the
persians
and
taking
him
whom
it
shall
choose
or
by
some
other
means
i
therefore
shall
not
be
a
competitor
with
you
for
i
do
not
desire
either
to
rule
or
to
be
ruled
and
on
this
condition
i
withdraw
from
my
claim
to
rule
namely
that
i
shall
not
be
ruled
by
any
of
you
either
i
myself
or
my
descendants
in
future
time
when
he
had
said
this
the
six
made
agreement
with
him
on
those
terms
and
he
was
no
longer
a
competitor
with
them
but
withdrew
from
the
assembly
and
at
the
present
time
this
house
remains
free
alone
of
all
the
persian
houses
and
submits
to
rule
only
so
far
as
it
wills
to
do
so
itself
not
transgressing
the
laws
of
the
persians
the
rest
however
of
the
seven
continued
to
deliberate
how
they
should
establish
a
king
in
the
most
just
manner
and
it
was
resolved
by
them
that
to
otanes
and
his
descendants
in
succession
if
the
kingdom
should
come
to
any
other
of
the
seven
there
should
be
given
as
special
gifts
a
median
dress
every
year
and
all
those
presents
which
are
esteemed
among
the
persians
to
be
the
most
valuable
and
the
reason
why
they
determined
that
these
things
should
be
given
to
him
was
because
he
first
suggested
to
them
the
matter
and
combined
them
together
these
were
special
gifts
for
otanes
and
this
they
also
determined
for
all
in
common
namely
that
any
one
of
the
seven
who
wished
might
pass
in
to
the
royal
palaces
without
any
to
bear
in
a
message
unless
the
king
happened
to
be
sleeping
with
his
wife
and
that
it
should
not
be
lawful
for
the
king
to
marry
from
any
other
family
but
only
from
those
of
the
men
who
had
made
insurrection
with
him
and
about
the
kingdom
they
determined
this
namely
that
the
man
whose
horse
should
first
neigh
at
sunrise
in
the
suburb
of
the
city
when
they
were
mounted
upon
their
horses
he
should
have
the
kingdom
now
dareios
had
a
clever
whose
name
was
oibares
to
this
man
when
they
had
left
their
assembly
dareios
spoke
these
words
oibares
we
have
resolved
to
do
about
the
kingdom
thus
namely
that
the
man
whose
horse
first
neighs
at
sunrise
when
we
are
mounted
upon
our
horses
he
shall
be
king
now
therefore
if
thou
hast
any
cleverness
contrive
that
we
may
obtain
this
prize
and
not
any
other
man
oibares
replied
thus
if
my
master
it
depends
in
truth
upon
this
whether
thou
be
king
or
no
have
confidence
so
far
as
concerns
this
and
keep
a
good
heart
for
none
other
shall
be
king
before
thee
such
charms
have
i
at
my
command
then
dareios
said
if
then
thou
hast
any
such
trick
it
is
time
to
devise
it
and
not
to
put
things
off
for
our
trial
is
oibares
therefore
hearing
this
did
as
follows
night
was
coming
on
he
took
one
of
the
mares
namely
that
one
which
the
horse
of
dareios
preferred
and
this
he
led
into
the
suburb
of
the
city
and
tied
her
up
then
he
brought
to
her
the
horse
of
dareios
and
having
for
some
time
led
him
round
her
making
him
go
so
close
by
so
as
to
touch
the
mare
at
last
he
let
the
horse
mount
now
at
dawn
of
day
the
six
came
to
the
place
as
they
had
agreed
riding
upon
their
horses
and
as
they
rode
through
by
the
suburb
of
the
city
when
they
came
near
the
place
where
the
mare
had
been
tied
up
on
the
former
night
the
horse
of
dareios
ran
up
to
the
place
and
neighed
and
just
when
the
horse
had
done
this
there
came
lightning
and
thunder
from
a
clear
sky
and
the
happening
of
these
things
to
dareios
consummated
his
claim
for
they
seemed
to
have
come
to
pass
by
some
design
and
the
others
leapt
down
from
their
horses
and
did
obeisance
to
dareios
some
say
that
the
contrivance
of
oibares
was
this
but
others
say
as
follows
for
the
story
is
told
by
the
persians
in
both
ways
namely
that
he
touched
with
his
hands
the
parts
of
this
mare
and
kept
his
hand
hidden
in
his
trousers
and
when
at
sunrise
they
were
about
to
let
the
horses
go
this
oibares
pulled
out
his
hand
and
applied
it
to
the
nostrils
of
the
horse
of
dareios
and
the
horse
perceiving
the
smell
snorted
and
neighed
so
dareios
the
son
of
hystaspes
had
been
declared
king
and
in
asia
all
except
the
arabians
were
his
subjects
having
been
subdued
by
cyrus
and
again
afterwards
by
cambyses
the
arabians
however
were
never
obedient
to
the
persians
under
conditions
of
subjection
but
had
become
when
they
let
cambyses
pass
by
to
egypt
for
against
the
will
of
the
arabians
the
persians
would
not
be
able
to
invade
egypt
moreover
dareios
made
the
most
noble
marriages
possible
in
the
estimation
of
the
persians
for
he
married
two
daughters
of
cyrus
atossa
and
artystone
of
whom
the
one
arossa
had
before
been
the
wife
of
cambyses
her
brother
and
then
afterwards
of
the
magian
while
artystone
was
a
virgin
and
besides
them
he
married
the
daughter
of
smerdis
the
son
of
cyrus
whose
name
was
parmys
and
he
also
took
to
wife
the
daughter
of
otanes
he
who
had
discovered
the
magian
and
all
things
became
filled
with
his
power
and
first
he
caused
to
be
a
carving
in
stone
and
set
it
up
and
in
it
there
was
the
figure
of
a
man
on
horseback
and
he
wrote
upon
it
writing
to
this
effect
dareios
son
of
hystaspes
by
the
excellence
of
his
horse
mentioning
the
name
of
it
and
of
his
oibares
obtained
the
kingdom
of
the
persians
having
so
done
in
persia
he
established
twenty
provinces
which
the
persians
themselves
call
satrapies
and
having
established
the
provinces
and
set
over
them
rulers
he
appointed
tribute
to
come
to
him
from
them
according
to
races
joining
also
to
the
chief
races
those
who
dwelt
on
their
borders
or
passing
beyond
the
immediate
neighbours
and
assigning
to
various
races
those
which
lay
more
distant
he
divided
the
provinces
and
the
yearly
payment
of
tribute
as
follows
and
those
of
them
who
brought
in
silver
were
commanded
to
pay
by
the
standard
of
the
babylonian
talent
but
those
who
brought
in
gold
by
the
euboïc
talent
now
the
babylonian
talent
is
equal
to
euboïc
pounds
for
in
the
reign
of
cyrus
and
again
of
cambyses
nothing
was
fixed
about
tribute
but
they
used
to
bring
gifts
and
on
account
of
this
appointing
of
tribute
and
other
things
like
this
the
persians
say
that
dareios
was
a
shopkeeper
cambyses
a
master
and
cyrus
a
father
the
one
because
he
dealt
with
all
his
affairs
like
a
shopkeeper
the
second
because
he
was
harsh
and
had
little
regard
for
any
one
and
the
other
because
he
was
gentle
and
contrived
for
them
all
things
good
from
the
ionians
and
the
magnesians
who
dwell
in
asia
and
the
aiolians
carians
lykians
milyans
and
pamphylians
for
one
single
sum
was
appointed
by
him
as
tribute
for
all
these
there
came
in
four
hundred
talents
of
silver
this
was
appointed
by
him
to
be
the
first
division
from
the
mysians
and
lydians
and
lasonians
and
cabalians
and
hytennians
there
came
in
five
hundred
talents
this
is
the
second
division
from
the
hellespontians
who
dwell
on
the
right
as
one
sails
in
and
the
phrygians
and
the
thracians
who
dwell
in
asia
and
the
paphlagonians
and
mariandynoi
and
syrians
the
tribute
was
three
hundred
and
sixty
talents
this
is
the
third
division
from
the
kilikians
besides
three
hundred
and
sixty
white
horses
one
for
every
day
in
the
year
there
came
also
five
hundred
talents
of
silver
of
these
one
hundred
and
forty
talents
were
spent
upon
the
horsemen
which
served
as
a
guard
to
the
kilikian
land
and
the
remaining
three
hundred
and
sixty
came
in
year
by
year
to
dareios
this
is
the
fourth
division
from
that
division
which
begins
with
the
city
of
posideion
founded
by
amphilochos
the
son
of
amphiaraos
on
the
borders
of
the
kilikians
and
the
syrians
and
extends
as
far
as
egypt
not
including
the
territory
of
the
arabians
for
this
was
free
from
payment
the
amount
was
three
hundred
and
fifty
talents
and
in
this
division
are
the
whole
of
phenicia
and
syria
which
is
called
palestine
and
cyprus
this
is
the
fifth
division
from
egypt
and
the
libyans
bordering
upon
egypt
and
from
kyrene
and
barca
for
these
were
so
ordered
as
to
belong
to
the
egyptian
division
there
came
in
seven
hundred
talents
without
reckoning
the
money
produced
by
the
lake
of
moiris
that
is
to
say
from
the
fish
without
reckoning
this
i
say
or
the
corn
which
was
contributed
in
addition
by
measure
there
came
in
seven
hundred
talents
for
as
regards
the
corn
they
contribute
by
measure
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
bushels
for
the
use
of
those
persians
who
are
established
in
the
white
fortress
at
memphis
and
for
their
foreign
mercenaries
this
is
the
sixth
division
the
sattagydai
and
gandarians
and
dadicans
and
aparytai
being
joined
together
brought
in
one
hundred
and
seventy
talents
this
is
the
seventh
division
from
susa
and
the
rest
of

this
is
the
eighth
division
from
babylon
and
from
the
rest
of
assyria
there
came
in
to
him
a
thousand
talents
of
silver
and
five
hundred
boys
for
eunuchs
this
is
the
ninth
division
from
agbatana

and
the
paricanians

orthocorybantians
four
hundred

this
is
the
tenth
division
the
caspians
and
pausicans
and
pantimathoi
and
dareitai
contributing
together
brought
in
two
hundred
talents
this
is
the
eleventh
division
from
the
bactrians
as
far
as
the
aigloi
the
tribute
was
three
hundred
and
sixty
talents
this
is
the
twelfth
division
from
pactyïke
and
the
armenians
and
the
people
bordering
upon
them
as
far
as
the
euxine
four
hundred
talents
this
is
the
thirteenth
division
from
the
sagartians
and
sarangians
and
thamanaians
and
utians
and
mycans
and
those
who
dwell
in
the
islands
of
the
erythraian
sea
where
the
king
settles
those
who
are
called
the
removed
from
all
these
together
a
tribute
was
produced
of
six
hundred
talents
this
is
the
fourteenth
division
the
sacans
and
the
caspians
brought
in
two
hundred
and
fifty

this
is
the
fifteenth
division
the
parthians

this
is
the
sixteenth
division
the
paricanians

ethiopians
in
asia
brought
in
four
hundred
talents
this
is
the
seventeenth
division
to
the
matienians
and
saspeirians
and
alarodians
was
appointed
a
tribute
of
two
hundred
talents
this
is
the
eighteenth
division
to
the
moschoi
and
tibarenians
and
macronians
and
mossynoicoi
and
mares
three
hundred
talents
were
ordered
this
is
the
nineteenth
division
of
the
indians
the
number
is
far
greater
than
that
of
any
other
race
of
men
of
whom
we
know
and
they
brought
in
a
tribute
larger
than
all
the
rest
that
is
to
say
three
hundred
and
sixty
talents
of
this
is
the
twentieth
division
now
if
we
compare
babylonian
with
euboïc
talents
the
silver
is
found
to
amount
to
nine
thousand
eight
hundred
and
eighty
talents
and
if
we
reckon
the
gold
at
thirteen
times
the
value
of
silver
weight
for
weight
the
is
found
to
amount
to
four
thousand
six
hundred
and
eighty
euboïc
talents
these
being
all
added
together
the
total
which
was
collected
as
yearly
tribute
for
dareios
amounts
to
fourteen
thousand
five
hundred
and
sixty
euboïc
talents
the
sums
which
are
less
than
these
i
pass
over
and
do
not
mention
this
was
the
tribute
which
came
in
to
dareios
from
asia
and
from
a
small
part
of
libya
but
as
time
went
on
other
tribute
came
in
also
from
the
islands
and
from
those
who
dwell
in
europe
as
far
as
thessaly
this
tribute
the
king
stores
up
in
his
treasury
in
the
following
manner
melts
it
down
and
pours
it
into
jars
of
earthenware
and
when
he
has
filled
the
jars
he
takes
off
the
earthenware
jar
from
the
metal
and
when
he
wants
money
he
cuts
off
so
much
as
he
needs
on
each
occasion
these
were
the
provinces
and
the
assessments
of
tribute
and
the
persian
land
alone
has
not
been
mentioned
by
me
as
paying
a
contribution
for
the
persians
have
their
land
to
dwell
in
free
from
payment
the
following
moreover
had
no
tribute
fixed
for
them
to
pay
but
brought
gifts
namely
the
ethiopians
who
border
upon
egypt
whom
cambyses
subdued
as
he
marched
against
the
ethiopians
those
who
dwell
about
nysa
which
is
called
sacred
and
who
celebrate
the
festivals
in
honour
of
dionysos
these
ethiopians
and
those
who
dwell
near
them
have
the
same
kind
of
seed
as
the
callantian
indians
and
they
have
underground
dwellings
these
both
together
brought
every
other
year
and
continue
to
bring
even
to
my
own
time
two
quart
measures
of
unmelted
gold
and
two
hundred
blocks
of
ebony
and
five
ethiopian
boys
and
twenty
large
elephant
tusks
the
colchians
also
had
set
themselves
among
those
who
brought
gifts
and
with
them
those
who
border
upon
them
extending
as
far
as
the
range
of
the
caucasus
for
the
persian
rule
extends
as
far
as
these
mountains
but
those
who
dwell
in
the
parts
beyond
caucasus
toward
the
north
wind
regard
the
persians
no
longer
i
say
continued
to
bring
the
gifts
which
they
had
fixed
for
themselves
every
four
years
even
down
to
my
own
time
that
is
to
say
a
hundred
boys
and
a
hundred
maidens
finally
the
arabians
brought
a
thousand
talents
of
frankincense
every
year
such
were
the
gifts
which
these
brought
to
the
king
apart
from
the
tribute
now
this
great
quantity
of
gold
out
of
which
the
indians
bring
in
to
the
king
the
which
has
been
mentioned
is
obtained
by
them
in
a
manner
which
i
shall
tell
part
of
the
indian
land
which
is
towards
the
rising
sun
is
sand
for
of
all
the
peoples
in
asia
of
which
we
know
or
about
which
any
certain
report
is
given
the
indians
dwell
furthest
away
towards
the
east
and
the
sunrising
seeing
that
the
country
to
the
east
of
the
indians
is
desert
on
account
of
the
sand
now
there
are
many
tribes
of
indians
and
they
do
not
agree
with
one
another
in
language
and
some
of
them
are
pastoral
and
others
not
so
and
some
dwell
in
the
swamps
of
the
river
and
feed
upon
raw
fish
which
they
catch
by
fishing
from
boats
made
of
cane
and
each
boat
is
made
of
one
joint
of
cane
these
indians
of
which
i
speak
wear
clothing
made
of
rushes
they
gather
and
cut
the
rushes
from
the
river
and
then
weave
them
together
into
a
kind
of
mat
and
put
it
on
like
a
corslet
others
of
the
indians
dwelling
to
the
east
of
these
are
pastoral
and
eat
raw
flesh
these
are
called
padaians
and
they
practise
the
following
customs
any
of
their
tribe
falls
ill
whether
it
be
a
woman
or
a
man
if
a
man
then
the
men
who
are
his
nearest
associates
put
him
to
death
saying
that
he
is
wasting
away
with
the
disease
and
his
flesh
is
being
spoilt
for
them
and
meanwhile
he
denies
stoutly
and
says
that
he
is
not
ill
but
they
do
not
agree
with
him
and
after
they
have
killed
him
they
feast
upon
his
flesh
but
if
it
be
a
woman
who
falls
ill
the
women
who
are
her
greatest
intimates
do
to
her
in
the
same
manner
as
the
men
do
in
the
other
case
for
in
fact
even
if
a
man
has
come
to
old
age
they
slay
him
and
feast
upon
him
but
very
few
of
them
come
to
be
reckoned
as
old
for
they
kill
every
one
who
falls
into
sickness
before
he
reaches
old
age
other
indians
have
on
the
contrary
a
manner
of
life
as
follows
neither
kill
any
living
thing
nor
do
they
sow
any
crops
nor
is
it
their
custom
to
possess
houses
but
they
feed
on
herbs
and
they
have
a
grain
of
the
size
of
millet
in
a
sheath
which
grows
of
itself
from
the
ground
this
they
gather
and
boil
with
the
sheath
and
make
it
their
food
and
whenever
any
of
them
falls
into
sickness
he
goes
to
the
desert
country
and
lies
there
and
none
of
them
pay
any
attention
either
to
one
who
is
dead
or
to
one
who
is
sick
the
sexual
intercourse
of
all
these
indians
of
whom
i
have
spoken
is
open
like
that
of
cattle
and
they
have
all
one
colour
of
skin
resembling
that
of
the
ethiopians
moreover
the
seed
which
they
emit
is
not
white
like
that
of
other
races
but
black
like
their
skin
and
the
ethiopians
also
are
similar
in
this
respect
these
tribes
of
indians
dwell
further
off
than
the
persian
power
extends
and
towards
the
south
wind
and
they
never
became
subjects
of
dareios
others
however
of
the
indians
are
on
the
borders
of
the
city
of
caspatyros
and
the
country
of
pactyïke
dwelling
towards
the
north
of
the
other
indians
and
they
have
a
manner
of
living
nearly
the
same
as
that
of
the
bactrians
these
are
the
most
warlike
of
the
indians
and
these
are
they
who
make
expeditions
for
the
gold
for
in
the
parts
where
they
live
it
is
desert
on
account
of
the
sand
and
in
this
desert
and
sandy
tract
are
produced
ants
which
are
in
size
smaller
than
dogs
but
larger
than
foxes
for
there
are
some
of
them
kept
at
the
residence
of
the
king
of
persia
which
are
caught
here
these
ants
then
make
their
dwelling
under
ground
and
carry
up
the
sand
just
in
the
same
manner
as
the
ants
found
in
the
land
of
the
hellenes
which
they
themselves
also
very
much
resemble
in
form
and
the
sand
which
is
brought
up
contains
gold
to
obtain
this
sand
the
indians
make
expeditions
into
the
desert
each
one
having
yoked
together
three
camels
placing
a
female
in
the
middle
and
a
male
like
a
to
draw
by
each
side
on
this
female
he
mounts
himself
having
arranged
carefully
that
she
shall
be
taken
to
be
yoked
from
young
ones
the
more
lately
born
the
better
for
their
female
camels
are
not
inferior
to
horses
in
speed
and
moreover
they
are
much
more
capable
of
bearing
weights
as
to
the
form
of
the
camel
i
do
not
here
describe
it
since
the
hellenes
for
whom
i
write
are
already
acquainted
with
it
but
i
shall
tell
that
which
is
not
commonly
known
about
it
which
is
this
camel
has
in
the
hind
legs
four
thighs
and
four
knees
and
its
organs
of
generation
are
between
the
hind
legs
turned
towards
the
tail
the
indians
i
say
ride
out
to
get
the
gold
in
the
manner
and
with
the
kind
of
yoking
which
i
have
described
making
calculations
so
that
they
may
be
engaged
in
carrying
it
off
at
the
time
when
the
greatest
heat
prevails
for
the
heat
causes
the
ants
to
disappear
underground
now
among
these
nations
the
sun
is
hottest
in
the
morning
hours
not
at
midday
as
with
others
but
from
sunrise
to
the
time
of
closing
the
market
and
during
this
time
it
produces
much
greater
heat
than
at
midday
in
hellas
so
that
it
is
said
that
then
they
drench
themselves
with
water
midday
however
has
about
equal
degree
of
heat
with
the
indians
as
with
other
men
while
after
midday
their
sun
becomes
like
the
morning
sun
with
other
men
and
after
this
as
it
goes
further
away
it
produces
still
greater
coolness
until
at
last
at
sunset
it
makes
the
air
very
cool
indeed
when
the
indians
have
come
to
the
place
with
bags
they
fill
them
with
the
sand
and
ride
away
back
as
quickly
as
they
can
for
forthwith
the
ants
perceiving
as
the
persians
allege
by
the
smell
begin
to
pursue
them
and
this
animal
they
say
is
superior
to
every
other
creature
in
swiftness
so
that
unless
the
indians
got
a
start
in
their
course
while
the
ants
were
gathering
together
not
one
of
them
would
escape
so
then
the
male
camels
for
they
are
inferior
in
speed
of
running
to
the
females
if
they
drag
behind
are
even
let
loose
from
the
side
of
the
female
one
after
the
other
the
females
however
remembering
the
young
which
they
left
behind
do
not
show
any
slackness
in
their
course
thus
it
is
that
the
indians
get
most
part
of
the
gold
as
the
persians
say
there
is
however
other
gold
also
in
their
land
obtained
by
digging
but
in
smaller
quantities
it
seems
indeed
that
the
extremities
of
the
inhabited
world
had
allotted
to
them
by
nature
the
fairest
things
just
as
it
was
the
lot
of
hellas
to
have
its
seasons
far
more
fairly
tempered
than
other
lands
for
first
india
is
the
most
distant
of
inhabited
lands
towards
the
east
as
i
have
said
a
little
above
and
in
this
land
not
only
the
animals
birds
as
well
as
beasts
are
much
larger
than
in
other
places
except
the
horses
which
are
surpassed
by
those
of
media
called
nessaian
but
also
there
is
gold
in
abundance
there
some
got
by
digging
some
brought
down
by
rivers
and
some
carried
off
as
i
explained
just
now
and
there
also
the
trees
which
grow
wild
produce
wool
which
surpasses
in
beauty
and
excellence
that
from
sheep
and
the
indians
wear
clothing
obtained
from
these
trees
then
again
arabia
is
the
furthest
of
inhabited
lands
in
the
direction
of
the
midday
and
in
it
alone
of
all
lands
grow
frankincense
and
myrrh
and
cassia
and
cinnamon
and
all
these
except
myrrh
are
got
with
difficulty
by
the
arabians
frankincense
they
collect
by
burning
the
storax
which
is
brought
thence
to
the
hellenes
by
the
phenicians
by
burning
this
i
say
so
as
to
produce
smoke
they
take
it
for
these
trees
which
produce
frankincense
are
guarded
by
winged
serpents
small
in
size
and
of
various
colours
which
watch
in
great
numbers
about
each
tree
of
the
same
kind
as
those
which
attempt
to
invade
egypt
and
they
can
not
be
driven
away
from
the
trees
by
any
other
thing
but
only
the
smoke
of
storax
the
arabians
say
also
that
all
the
world
would
have
been
by
this
time
filled
with
these
serpents
if
that
did
not
happen
with
regard
to
them
which
i
knew
happened
with
regard
to
vipers
and
it
seems
that
the
divine
providence
as
indeed
was
to
be
expected
seeing
that
it
is
wise
has
made
all
those
animals
prolific
which
are
of
cowardly
spirit
and
good
for
food
in
order
that
they
may
not
be
all
eaten
up
and
their
race
fail
whereas
it
has
made
those
which
are
bold
and
noxious
to
have
small
progeny
for
example
because
the
hare
is
hunted
by
every
beast
and
bird
as
well
as
by
man
therefore
it
is
so
very
prolific
as
it
is
and
this
is
the
only
one
of
all
beasts
which
becomes
pregnant
again
before
the
former
young
are
born
and
has
in
its
womb
some
of
its
young
covered
with
fur
and
others
bare
and
while
one
is
just
being
shaped
in
the
matrix
another
is
being
conceived
thus
it
is
in
this
case
whereas
the
lioness
which
is
the
strongest
and
most
courageous
of
creatures
produces
one
cub
once
only
in
her
life
for
when
she
produces
young
she
casts
out
her
womb
together
with
her
young
and
the
cause
of
it
is
this
the
cub
being
within
the
mother
begins
to
move
about
then
having
claws
by
far
sharper
than
those
of
any
other
beast
he
tears
the
womb
and
as
he
grows
larger
he
proceeds
much
further
in
his
scratching
at
last
the
time
of
birth
approaches
and
there
is
now
nothing
at
all
left
of
it
in
a
sound
condition
just
so
also
if
vipers
and
the
winged
serpents
of
the
arabians
were
produced
in
the
ordinary
course
of
their
nature
man
would
not
be
able
to
live
upon
the
earth
but
as
it
is
when
they
couple
with
one
another
and
the
male
is
in
the
act
of
generation
as
he
lets
go
from
him
the
seed
the
female
seizes
hold
of
his
neck
and
fastening
on
to
it
does
not
relax
her
hold
till
she
has
eaten
it
through
the
male
then
dies
in
the
manner
which
i
have
said
but
the
female
pays
the
penalty
of
retribution
for
the
male
in
this
manner
young
while
they
are
still
in
the
womb
take
vengeance
for
their
father
by
eating
through
their
mother
and
having
eaten
through
her
belly
they
thus
make
their
way
out
for
themselves
other
serpents
however
which
are
not
hurtful
to
man
produce
eggs
and
hatch
from
them
a
very
large
number
of
offspring
now
vipers
are
distributed
over
all
the
earth
but
the
others
which
are
winged
are
found
in
great
numbers
together
in
arabia
and
in
no
other
land
therefore
it
is
that
they
appear
to
be
numerous
this
frankincense
then
is
obtained
thus
by
the
arabians
and
cassia
is
obtained
as
follows
bind
up
in
and
other
kinds
of
skins
all
their
body
and
their
face
except
only
the
eyes
and
then
go
to
get
the
cassia
this
grows
in
a
pool
not
very
deep
and
round
the
pool
and
in
it
lodge
it
seems
winged
beasts
nearly
resembling
bats
and
they
squeak
horribly
and
are
courageous
in
fight
these
they
must
keep
off
from
their
eyes
and
so
cut
the
cassia
cinnamon
they
collect
in
a
yet
more
marvellous
manner
than
this
for
where
it
grows
and
what
land
produces
it
they
are
not
able
to
tell
except
only
that
some
say
and
it
is
a
probable
account
that
it
grows
in
those
regions
where
dionysos
was
brought
up
and
they
say
that
large
birds
carry
those
dried
sticks
which
we
have
learnt
from
the
phenicians
to
call
cinnamon
carry
them
i
say
to
nests
which
are
made
of
clay
and
stuck
on
to
precipitous
sides
of
mountains
which
man
can
find
no
means
of
scaling
with
regard
to
this
then
the
arabians
practise
the
following
contrivance
divide
up
the
limbs
of
the
oxen
and
asses
that
die
and
of
their
other
beasts
of
burden
into
pieces
as
large
as
convenient
and
convey
them
to
these
places
and
when
they
have
laid
them
down
not
far
from
the
nests
they
withdraw
to
a
distance
from
them
and
the
birds
fly
down
and
carry
the
limbs
of
the
beasts
of
burden
off
to
their
nests
and
these
are
not
able
to
bear
them
but
break
down
and
fall
to
the
earth
and
the
men
come
up
to
them
and
collect
the
cinnamon
thus
cinnamon
is
collected
and
comes
from
this
nation
to
the
other
countries
of
the
world
however
which
the
arabians
call
ladanon
comes
in
a
still
more
extraordinary
manner
for
though
it
is
the
most
of
all
things
it
comes
in
the
most
thing
since
it
is
found
in
the
beards
of
produced
there
like
resin
from
wood
this
is
of
use
for
the
making
of
many
perfumes
and
the
arabians
use
it
more
than
anything
else
as
incense
let
what
we
have
said
suffice
with
regard
to
spices
and
from
the
land
of
arabia
there
blows
a
scent
of
them
most
marvellously
sweet
they
have
also
two
kinds
of
sheep
which
are
worthy
of
admiration
and
are
not
found
in
any
other
land
the
one
kind
has
the
tail
long
not
less
than
three
cubits
in
length
and
if
one
should
allow
these
to
drag
these
after
them
they
would
have
sores
from
their
tails
being
worn
away
against
the
ground
but
as
it
is
every
one
of
the
shepherds
knows
enough
of
carpentering
to
make
little
cars
which
they
tie
under
the
tails
fastening
the
tail
of
each
animal
to
a
separate
little
car
the
other
kind
of
sheep
has
the
tail
broad
even
as
much
as
a
cubit
in
breadth
as
one
passes
beyond
the
place
of
the
midday
the
ethiopian
land
is
that
which
extends
furthest
of
all
inhabited
lands
towards
the
sunset
this
produces
both
gold
in
abundance
and
huge
elephants
and
trees
of
all
kinds
growing
wild
and
ebony
and
men
who
are
of
all
men
the
tallest
the
most
beautiful
and
the
most
these
are
the
extremities
in
asia
and
in
libya
but
as
to
the
extremities
of
europe
towards
the
west
i
am
not
able
to
speak
with
certainty
for
neither
do
i
accept
the
tale
that
there
is
a
river
called
in
barbarian
tongue
eridanos
flowing
into
the
sea
which
lies
towards
the
north
wind
whence
it
is
said
that
amber
comes
nor
do
i
know
of
the
real
existence
of
tin
islands
from
which
tin
comes
to
us
for
first
the
name
eridanos
itself
declares
that
it
is
hellenic
and
that
it
does
not
belong
to
a
barbarian
speech
but
was
invented
by
some
poet
and
secondly
i
am
not
able
to
hear
from
any
one
who
has
been
an
though
i
took
pains
to
discover
this
that
there
is
a
sea
on
the
other
side
of
europe
however
that
may
be
tin
and
amber
certainly
come
to
us
from
the
extremity
of
europe
then
again
towards
the
north
of
europe
there
is
evidently
a
quantity
of
gold
by
far
larger
than
in
any
other
land
as
to
how
it
is
got
here
again
i
am
not
able
to
say
for
certain
but
it
is
said
to
be
carried
off
from
the
griffins
by
arimaspians
a
race
of
men
but
i
do
not
believe
this
tale
either
that
nature
produces
men
which
in
all
other
respects
are
like
other
men
however
it
would
seem
that
the
extremities
which
bound
the
rest
of
the
world
on
every
side
and
enclose
it
in
the
midst
possess
the
things
which
by
us
are
thought
to
be
the
most
beautiful
and
the
most
rare
now
there
is
a
plain
in
asia
bounded
by
mountains
on
all
sides
and
through
the
mountains
there
are
five
clefts
this
plain
belonged
once
to
the
chorasmians
and
it
lies
on
the
borders
of
the
chorasmians
themselves
the
hyrcanians
parthians
sarangians
and
thamanaians
but
from
the
time
that
the
persians
began
to
bear
rule
it
belongs
to
the
king
from
this
enclosing
mountain
of
which
i
speak
there
flows
a
great
river
and
its
name
is
akes
this
formerly
watered
the
lands
of
these
nations
which
have
been
mentioned
being
divided
into
five
streams
and
conducted
through
a
separate
cleft
in
the
mountains
to
each
separate
nation
but
from
the
time
that
they
have
come
to
be
under
the
persians
they
have
suffered
as
follows
king
built
up
the
clefts
in
the
mountains
and
set
gates
at
each
cleft
and
so
since
the
water
has
been
shut
off
from
its
outlet
the
plain
within
the
mountains
is
made
into
a
sea
because
the
river
runs
into
it
and
has
no
way
out
in
any
direction
those
therefore
who
in
former
times
had
been
wont
to
make
use
of
the
water
not
being
able
now
to
make
use
of
it
are
in
great
trouble
for
during
the
winter
they
have
rain
from
heaven
as
also
other
men
have
but
in
the
summer
they
desire
to
use
the
water
when
they
sow
millet
and
sesame
seed
so
then
the
water
not
being
granted
to
them
they
come
to
the
persians
both
themselves
and
their
wives
and
standing
at
the
gates
of
the
king
court
they
cry
and
howl
and
the
king
orders
that
for
those
who
need
it
most
the
gates
which
lead
to
their
land
shall
be
opened
and
when
their
land
has
become
satiated
with
drinking
in
the
water
these
gates
are
closed
and
he
orders
the
gates
to
be
opened
for
others
that
is
to
say
those
most
needing
it
of
the
rest
who
remain
and
as
i
have
heard
he
exacts
large
sums
of
money
for
opening
them
besides
the
regular
tribute
thus
it
is
with
these
matters
but
of
the
seven
men
who
had
risen
against
the
magian
it
happened
to
one
namely
intaphrenes
to
be
put
to
death
immediately
after
their
insurrection
for
an
outrage
which
i
shall
relate
he
desired
to
enter
into
the
king
palace
and
confer
with
the
king
for
the
law
was
in
fact
so
that
those
who
had
risen
up
against
the
magian
were
permitted
to
go
in
to
the
king
presence
without
any
one
to
announce
them
unless
the
king
happened
to
be
lying
with
his
wife
accordingly
intaphrenes
did
not
think
it
fit
that
any
one
should
announce
his
coming
but
as
he
was
one
of
the
seven
he
desired
to
enter
the
gatekeeper
however
and
the
bearer
of
messages
endeavoured
to
prevent
him
saying
that
the
king
was
lying
with
his
wife
but
intaphrenes
believing
that
they
were
not
speaking
the
truth
drew
his
sword
and
cut
off
their
ears
and
their
noses
and
stringing
these
upon
his
horse
bridle
he
tied
them
round
their
necks
and
so
let
them
go
upon
this
they
showed
themselves
to
the
king
and
told
the
cause
for
which
they
had
suffered
this
and
dareios
fearing
that
the
six
might
have
done
this
by
common
design
sent
for
each
one
separately
and
made
trial
of
his
inclinations
as
to
whether
he
approved
of
that
which
had
been
done
and
when
he
was
fully
assured
that
intaphrenes
had
not
done
this
in
combination
with
them
he
took
both
intaphrenes
himself
and
his
sons
and
all
his
kinsmen
being
much
disposed
to
believe
that
he
was
plotting
insurrection
against
him
with
the
help
of
his
relations
and
having
seized
them
he
put
them
in
bonds
as
for
execution
then
the
wife
of
intaphrenes
coming
constantly
to
the
doors
of
the
king
court
wept
and
bewailed
herself
and
by
doing
this
continually
after
the
same
manner
she
moved
dareios
to
pity
her
accordingly
he
sent
a
messenger
and
said
to
her
woman
king
dareios
grants
to
thee
to
save
from
death
one
of
thy
kinsmen
who
are
lying
in
bonds
whomsoever
thou
desirest
of
them
all
she
then
having
considered
with
herself
answered
thus
if
in
truth
the
king
grants
me
the
life
of
one
i
choose
of
them
all
my
brother
dareios
being
informed
of
this
and
marvelling
at
her
speech
sent
and
addressed
her
thus
woman
the
king
asks
thee
what
was
in
thy
mind
that
thou
didst
leave
thy
husband
and
thy
children
to
die
and
didst
choose
thy
brother
to
survive
seeing
that
he
is
surely
less
near
to
thee
in
blood
than
thy
children
and
less
dear
to
thee
than
thy
husband
she
made
answer
o
king
i
might
if
heaven
willed
have
another
husband
and
other
children
if
i
should
lose
these
but
another
brother
i
could
by
no
means
have
seeing
that
my
father
and
my
mother
are
no
longer
alive
this
was
in
my
mind
when
i
said
those
words
to
dareios
then
it
seemed
that
the
woman
had
spoken
well
and
he
let
go
not
only
him
for
whose
life
she
asked
but
also
the
eldest
of
her
sons
because
he
was
pleased
with
her
but
all
the
others
he
slew
one
therefore
of
the
seven
had
perished
immediately
in
the
manner
which
has
been
related
now
about
the
time
of
the
sickness
of
cambyses
it
had
come
to
pass
as
follows
was
one
oroites
a
persian
who
had
been
appointed
by
cyrus
to
be
governor
of
the
province
of
sardis
this
man
had
set
his
desire
upon
an
unholy
thing
for
though
from
polycrates
the
samian
he
had
never
suffered
anything
nor
heard
any
offensive
word
nor
even
seen
him
before
that
time
he
desired
to
take
him
and
put
him
to
death
for
a
reason
of
this
kind
as
most
who
report
the
matter
say
oroites
and
another
persian
whose
name
was
mitrobates
ruler
of
the
province
of
daskyleion
were
sitting
at
the
door
of
the
king
court
they
came
from
words
to
strife
with
one
another
and
as
they
debated
their
several
claims
to
excellence
mitrobates
taunting
oroites
said
dost
thou
count
thyself
a
man
who
didst
never
yet
win
for
the
king
the
island
of
samos
which
lies
close
to
thy
province
when
it
is
so
exceedingly
easy
of
conquest
that
one
of
the
natives
of
it
rose
up
against
the
government
with
fifteen
and
got
possession
of
the
island
and
is
now
despot
of
it
some
say
that
because
he
heard
this
and
was
stung
by
the
reproach
he
formed
the
desire
not
so
much
to
take
vengeance
on
him
who
said
this
as
to
bring
polycrates
to
destruction
at
all
costs
since
by
reason
of
him
he
was
ill
spoken
of
the
lesser
number
however
of
those
who
tell
the
tale
say
that
oroites
sent
a
herald
to
samos
to
ask
for
something
or
other
but
what
it
was
is
not
mentioned
and
polycrates
happened
to
be
lying
down
in
the
men
chamber
of
his
palace
and
anacreon
also
of
teos
was
present
with
him
and
somehow
whether
it
was
by
intention
and
because
he
made
no
account
of
the
business
of
oroites
or
whether
some
chance
occurred
to
bring
it
about
it
happened
that
the
envoy
of
oroites
came
into
his
presence
and
spoke
with
him
and
polycrates
who
chanced
to
be
turned
away
towards
the
wall
neither
turned
round
at
all
nor
made
any
answer
the
cause
then
of
the
death
of
polycrates
is
reported
in
these
two
different
ways
and
we
may
believe
whichever
of
them
we
please
oroites
however
having
his
residence
at
that
magnesia
which
is
situated
upon
the
river
maiander
sent
myrsos
the
son
of
gyges
a
lydian
to
samos
bearing
a
message
since
he
had
perceived
the
designs
of
polycrates
for
polycrates
was
the
first
of
the
hellenes
of
whom
we
have
any
knowledge
who
set
his
mind
upon
having
command
of
the
sea
excepting
minos
the
cnossian
and
any
other
who
may
have
had
command
of
the
sea
before
his
time
of
that
which
we
call
mortal
race
polycrates
was
the
first
and
he
had
great
expectation
of
becoming
ruler
of
ionia
and
of
the
islands
oroites
accordingly
having
perceived
that
he
had
this
design
sent
a
message
to
him
and
said
thus
oroites
to
polycrates
saith
as
follows
i
hear
that
thou
art
making
plans
to
get
great
power
and
that
thou
hast
not
wealth
according
to
thy
high
thoughts
now
therefore
if
thou
shalt
do
as
i
shall
say
thou
wilt
do
well
for
thyself
on
the
one
hand
and
also
save
me
from
destruction
for
king
cambyses
is
planning
death
for
me
and
this
is
reported
to
me
so
that
i
can
not
doubt
it
do
thou
then
carry
away
out
of
danger
both
myself
and
with
me
my
wealth
and
of
this
keep
a
part
for
thyself
and
a
part
let
me
keep
and
then
so
far
as
wealth
may
bring
it
about
thou
shalt
be
ruler
of
all
hellas
and
if
thou
dost
not
believe
that
which
i
say
about
the
money
send
some
one
whosoever
happens
to
be
most
trusted
by
thee
and
to
him
i
will
show
it
polycrates
having
heard
this
rejoiced
and
was
disposed
to
agree
and
as
he
had
a
great
desire
it
seems
for
wealth
he
first
sent
maiandrios
the
son
of
maiandrios
a
native
of
samos
who
was
his
secretary
to
see
it
this
man
was
the
same
who
not
long
after
these
events
dedicated
all
the
ornaments
of
the
men
chamber
in
the
palace
of
polycrates
ornaments
well
worth
seeing
as
an
offering
to
the
temple
of
hera
oroites
accordingly
having
heard
that
the
person
sent
to
examine
might
be
expected
soon
to
come
did
as
follows
that
is
to
say
he
filled
eight
chests
with
stones
except
a
small
depth
at
the
very
top
of
each
and
laid
gold
above
upon
the
stones
then
he
tied
up
the
chests
and
kept
them
in
readiness
so
maiandrios
came
and
looked
at
them
and
brought
back
word
to
polycrates
and
he
upon
that
prepared
to
set
out
thither
although
the
diviners
and
also
his
friends
strongly
dissuaded
him
from
it
and
in
spite
moreover
of
a
vision
which
his
daughter
had
seen
in
sleep
of
this
kind
seemed
to
her
that
her
father
was
raised
up
on
high
and
was
bathed
by
zeus
and
anointed
by
the
sun
having
seen
this
vision
she
used
every
kind
of
endeavour
to
dissuade
polycrates
from
leaving
his
land
to
go
to
oroites
and
besides
that
as
he
was
going
to
his
galley
she
accompanied
his
departure
with
prophetic
words
and
he
threatened
her
that
if
he
should
return
safe
she
should
remain
unmarried
for
long
but
she
prayed
that
this
might
come
to
pass
for
she
desired
rather
she
said
to
be
unmarried
for
long
than
to
be
an
orphan
having
lost
her
father
polycrates
however
neglected
every
counsel
and
set
sail
to
go
to
oroites
taking
with
him
besides
many
others
of
his
friends
demokedes
also
the
son
of
calliphon
a
man
of
croton
who
was
a
physician
and
practised
his
art
better
than
any
other
man
of
his
time
then
when
he
arrived
at
magnesia
polycrates
was
miserably
put
to
death
in
a
manner
unworthy
both
of
himself
and
of
his
high
ambition
for
excepting
those
who
become
despots
of
the
syracusans
not
one
besides
of
the
hellenic
despots
is
worthy
to
be
compared
with
polycrates
in
magnificence
and
when
he
had
killed
him
in
a
manner
not
fit
to
be
told
oroites
impaled
his
body
and
of
those
who
accompanied
him
as
many
as
were
samians
he
released
bidding
them
be
grateful
to
him
that
they
were
free
men
but
all
those
of
his
company
who
were
either
allies
or
servants
he
held
in
the
estimation
of
slaves
and
kept
them
polycrates
then
being
hung
up
accomplished
wholly
the
vision
of
his
daughter
for
he
was
bathed
by
zeus
whenever
it
rained
and
anointed
by
the
sun
giving
forth
moisture
himself
from
his
body
to
this
end
came
the
great
prosperity
of
polycrates
as
amasis
the
king
of
egypt
had
foretold
to
him
but
not
long
afterwards
retribution
overtook
oroites
in
his
turn
for
the
murder
of
polycrates
for
after
the
death
of
cambyses
and
the
reign
of
the
magians
oroites
remained
at
sardis
and
did
no
service
to
the
persians
when
they
had
been
deprived
of
their
empire
by
the
medes
moreover
during
this
time
of
disturbance
he
slew
mitrobates
the
governor
in
daskyleion
who
had
brought
up
against
him
the
matter
of
polycrates
as
a
reproach
and
he
slew
also
cranaspes
the
son
of
mitrobates
both
men
of
repute
among
the
persians
and
besides
other
various
deeds
of
insolence
once
when
a
bearer
of
messages
had
come
to
him
from
dareios
not
being
pleased
with
the
message
which
he
brought
he
slew
him
as
he
was
returning
having
set
men
to
lie
in
wait
for
him
by
the
way
and
having
slain
him
he
made
away
with
the
bodies
both
of
the
man
and
of
his
horse
dareios
accordingly
when
he
had
come
to
the
throne
was
desirous
of
taking
vengeance
upon
oroites
for
all
his
wrongdoings
and
especially
for
the
murder
of
mitrobates
and
his
son
however
he
did
not
think
it
good
to
act
openly
and
to
send
an
army
against
him
since
his
own
affairs
were
still
in
a
disturbed
state
and
he
had
only
lately
come
to
the
throne
while
he
heard
that
the
strength
of
oroites
was
great
seeing
that
he
had
a
bodyguard
of
a
thousand
persian
spearmen
and
was
in
possession
of
the
divisions
of
phrygia
and
lydia
and
ionia
therefore
dareios
contrived
as
follows
called
together
those
of
the
persians
who
were
of
most
repute
he
said
to
them
persians
which
of
you
all
will
undertake
to
perform
this
matter
for
me
with
wisdom
and
not
by
force
or
with
tumult
for
where
wisdom
is
wanted
there
is
no
need
of
force
which
of
you
i
say
will
either
bring
oroites
alive
to
me
or
slay
him
for
he
never
yet
did
any
service
to
the
persians
and
on
the
other
hand
he
has
done
to
them
great
evil
first
he
destroyed
two
of
us
mitrobates
and
his
son
then
he
slays
the
men
who
go
to
summon
him
sent
by
me
displaying
insolence
not
to
be
endured
before
therefore
he
shall
accomplish
any
other
evil
against
the
persians
we
must
check
his
course
by
death
thus
dareios
asked
and
thirty
men
undertook
the
matter
each
one
separately
desiring
to
do
it
himself
and
dareios
stopped
their
contention
and
bade
them
cast
lots
so
when
they
cast
lots
bagaios
the
son
of
artontes
obtained
the
lot
from
among
them
all
bagaios
accordingly
having
obtained
the
lot
did
thus
wrote
many
papers
dealing
with
various
matters
and
on
them
set
the
seal
of
dareios
and
with
them
he
went
to
sardis
when
he
arrived
there
and
came
into
the
presence
of
oroites
he
took
the
covers
off
the
papers
one
after
another
and
gave
them
to
the
royal
secretary
to
read
for
all
the
governors
of
provinces
have
royal
secretaries
now
bagaios
thus
gave
the
papers
in
order
to
make
trial
of
the
spearmen
of
the
guard
whether
they
would
accept
the
motion
to
revolt
from
oroites
and
seeing
that
they
paid
great
reverence
to
the
papers
and
still
more
to
the
words
which
were
recited
from
them
he
gave
another
paper
in
which
were
contained
these
words
persians
king
dareios
forbids
you
to
serve
as
guards
to
oroites
and
they
hearing
this
lowered
to
him
the
points
of
their
spears
then
bagaios
seeing
that
in
this
they
were
obedient
to
the
paper
took
courage
upon
that
and
gave
the
last
of
the
papers
to
the
secretary
and
in
it
was
written
king
dareios
commands
the
persians
who
are
in
sardis
to
slay
oroites
so
the
spearmen
of
the
guard
when
they
heard
this
drew
their
swords
and
slew
him
forthwith
thus
did
retribution
for
the
murder
of
polycrates
the
samian
overtake
oroites
when
the
wealth
of
oroites
had
come
or
had
been
carried
up
to
susa
it
happened
not
long
after
that
king
dareios
while
engaged
in
hunting
wild
beasts
twisted
his
foot
in
leaping
off
his
horse
and
it
was
twisted
as
it
seems
rather
violently
for
the
ball
of
his
was
put
out
of
the
socket
now
he
had
been
accustomed
to
keep
about
him
those
of
the
egyptians
who
were
accounted
the
first
in
the
art
of
medicine
and
he
made
use
of
their
assistance
then
but
these
by
wrenching
and
forcing
the
foot
made
the
evil
continually
greater
for
seven
days
then
and
seven
nights
dareios
was
sleepless
owing
to
the
pain
which
he
suffered
and
at
last
on
the
eighth
day
when
he
was
in
a
wretched
state
some
one
who
had
heard
talk
before
while
yet
at
sardis
of
the
skill
of
demokedes
of
croton
reported
this
to
dareios
and
he
bade
them
bring
him
forthwith
into
his
presence
so
having
found
him
somewhere
unnoticed
among
the
slaves
of
oroites
they
brought
him
forth
into
the
midst
dragging
fetters
after
him
and
clothed
in
rags
when
he
had
been
placed
in
the
midst
of
them
dareios
asked
him
whether
he
understood
the
art
but
he
would
not
admit
it
fearing
lest
if
he
declared
himself
to
be
what
he
was
he
might
lose
for
ever
the
hope
of
returning
to
hellas
and
it
was
clear
to
dareios
that
he
understood
that
art
but
was
practising
another
and
he
commanded
those
who
had
brought
him
thither
to
produce
scourges
and
pricks
accordingly
upon
that
he
spoke
out
saying
that
he
did
not
understand
it
precisely
but
that
he
had
kept
company
with
a
physician
and
had
some
poor
knowledge
of
the
art
then
after
this
when
dareios
had
committed
the
case
to
him
by
using
hellenic
drugs
and
applying
mild
remedies
after
the
former
violent
means
he
caused
him
to
get
sleep
and
in
a
short
time
made
him
perfectly
well
though
he
had
never
hoped
to
be
sound
of
foot
again
upon
this
dareios
presented
him
with
two
pairs
of
golden
fetters
and
he
asked
him
whether
it
was
by
design
that
he
had
given
to
him
a
double
share
of
his
suffering
because
he
had
made
him
well
being
pleased
by
this
saying
dareios
sent
him
to
visit
his
wives
and
the
eunuchs
in
bringing
him
in
said
to
the
women
that
this
was
he
who
had
restored
to
the
king
his
life
then
each
one
of
them
plunged
a
cup
into
the
and
presented
demokedes
with
so
abundant
a
gift
that
his
servant
whose
name
was
skiton
following
and
gathering
up
the
coins
which
fell
from
the
cups
collected
for
himself
a
very
large
sum
of
gold
this
demokedes
came
from
croton
and
became
the
associate
of
polycrates
in
the
following
manner
croton
he
lived
in
strife
with
his
father
who
was
of
a
harsh
temper
and
when
he
could
no
longer
endure
him
he
departed
and
came
to
egina
being
established
there
he
surpassed
in
the
first
year
all
the
other
physicians
although
he
was
without
appliances
and
had
none
of
the
instruments
which
are
used
in
the
art
in
the
next
year
the
eginetan
state
engaged
him
for
a
payment
of
one
talent
in
the
third
year
he
was
engaged
by
the
athenians
for
a
hundred
pounds
weight
of
silver
and
in
the
fourth
by
polycrates
for
two
talents
thus
he
arrived
in
samos
and
it
was
by
reason
of
this
man
more
than
anything
else
that
the
physicians
of
croton
got
their
reputation
for
this
event
happened
at
the
time
when
the
physicians
of
croton
began
to
be
spoken
of
as
the
first
in
hellas
while
the
kyrenians
were
reputed
to
have
the
second
place
about
this
same
time
also
the
argives
had
the
reputation
of
being
the
first
musicians
in
hellas
then
demokedes
having
healed
king
dareios
had
a
very
great
house
in
susa
and
had
been
made
a
of
the
king
and
except
the
one
thing
of
returning
to
the
land
of
the
hellenes
he
had
everything
and
first
as
regards
the
egyptian
physicians
who
tried
to
heal
the
king
before
him
when
they
were
about
to
be
impaled
because
they
had
proved
inferior
to
a
physician
who
was
a
hellene
he
asked
their
lives
of
the
king
and
rescued
them
from
death
then
secondly
he
rescued
an
eleian
prophet
who
had
accompanied
polycrates
and
had
remained
unnoticed
among
the
slaves
in
short
demokedes
was
very
great
in
the
favour
of
the
king
not
long
time
after
this
another
thing
came
to
pass
which
was
this
the
daughter
of
cyrus
and
wife
of
dareios
had
a
tumour
upon
her
breast
which
afterwards
burst
and
then
was
spreading
further
and
so
long
as
it
was
not
large
she
concealed
it
and
said
nothing
to
anybody
because
she
was
ashamed
but
afterwards
when
she
was
in
evil
case
she
sent
for
demokedes
and
showed
it
to
him
and
he
said
that
he
would
make
her
well
and
caused
her
to
swear
that
she
would
surely
do
for
him
in
return
that
which
he
should
ask
of
her
and
he
would
ask
he
said
none
of
such
things
as
are
shameful
so
when
after
this
by
his
treatment
he
had
made
her
well
then
atossa
instructed
by
demokedes
uttered
to
dareios
in
his
bedchamber
some
such
words
as
these
o
king
though
thou
hast
such
great
power
thou
dost
sit
still
and
dost
not
win
in
addition
any
nation
or
power
for
the
persians
and
yet
it
is
reasonable
that
a
man
who
is
both
young
and
master
of
much
wealth
should
be
seen
to
perform
some
great
deed
in
order
that
the
persians
may
know
surely
that
he
is
a
man
by
whom
they
are
ruled
it
is
expedient
indeed
in
two
ways
that
thou
shouldest
do
so
both
in
order
that
the
persians
may
know
that
their
ruler
is
a
man
and
in
order
that
they
may
be
worn
down
by
war
and
not
have
leisure
to
plot
against
thee
for
now
thou
mightest
display
some
great
deed
while
thou
art
still
young
seeing
that
as
the
body
grows
the
spirit
grows
old
also
with
it
and
is
blunted
for
every
kind
of
action
thus
she
spoke
according
to
instructions
received
and
he
answered
thus
woman
thou
hast
said
all
the
things
which
i
myself
have
in
mind
to
do
for
i
have
made
the
plan
to
yoke
together
a
bridge
from
this
continent
to
the
other
and
to
make
expedition
against
the
scythians
and
these
designs
will
be
by
way
of
being
fulfilled
within
a
little
time
then
atossa
said
look
now
to
go
first
against
the
scythians
for
these
will
be
in
thy
power
whenever
thou
desirest
but
do
thou
i
pray
thee
make
an
expedition
against
hellas
for
i
am
desirous
to
have
lacedemonian
women
and
argive
and
athenian
and
corinthian
for
attendants
because
i
hear
of
them
by
report
and
thou
hast
the
man
who
of
all
men
is
most
fitted
to
show
thee
all
things
which
relate
to
hellas
and
to
be
thy
guide
that
man
i
mean
who
healed
thy
foot
dareios
made
answer
woman
since
it
seems
good
to
thee
that
we
should
first
make
trial
of
hellas
i
think
it
better
to
send
first
to
them
men
of
the
persians
together
with
him
of
whom
thou
speakest
to
make
investigation
that
when
these
have
learnt
and
seen
they
may
report
each
several
thing
to
us
and
then
i
shall
go
to
attack
them
with
full
knowledge
of
all
thus
he
said
and
he
proceeded
to
do
the
deed
as
he
spoke
the
word
for
as
soon
as
day
dawned
he
summoned
fifteen
persians
men
of
repute
and
bade
them
pass
through
the
coasts
of
hellas
in
company
with
demokedes
and
take
care
not
to
let
demokedes
escape
from
them
but
bring
him
back
at
all
costs
having
thus
commanded
them
next
he
summoned
demokedes
himself
and
asked
him
to
act
as
a
guide
for
the
whole
of
hellas
and
show
it
to
the
persians
and
then
return
back
and
he
bade
him
take
all
his
movable
goods
and
carry
them
as
gifts
to
his
father
and
his
brothers
saying
that
he
would
give
him
in
their
place
many
times
as
much
and
besides
this
he
said
he
would
contribute
to
the
gifts
a
merchant
ship
filled
with
all
manner
of
goods
which
should
sail
with
him
dareios
as
it
seems
to
me
promised
him
these
things
with
no
crafty
design
but
demokedes
was
afraid
that
dareios
was
making
trial
of
him
and
did
not
make
haste
to
accept
all
that
was
offered
but
said
that
he
would
leave
his
own
things
where
they
were
so
that
he
might
have
them
when
he
came
back
he
said
however
that
he
accepted
the
merchant
ship
which
dareios
promised
him
for
the
presents
to
his
brothers
dareios
then
having
thus
given
command
to
him
also
sent
them
away
to
the
sea
so
these
when
they
had
gone
down
to
phenicia
and
in
phenicia
to
the
city
of
sidon
forthwith
manned
two
triremes
and
besides
them
they
also
filled
a
large
ship
of
burden
with
all
manner
of
goods
then
when
they
had
made
all
things
ready
they
set
sail
for
hellas
and
touching
at
various
places
they
saw
the
coast
regions
of
it
and
wrote
down
a
description
until
at
last
when
they
had
seen
the
greater
number
of
the
famous
places
they
came
to
taras
in
italy
there
from
complaisance
to
demokedes
aristophilides
the
king
of
the
tarentines
unfastened
and
removed
the
of
the
median
ships
and
also
confined
the
persians
in
prison
because
as
he
alleged
they
came
as
spies
while
they
were
being
thus
dealt
with
demokedes
went
away
and
reached
croton
and
when
he
had
now
reached
his
own
native
place
aristophilides
set
the
persians
free
and
gave
back
to
them
those
parts
of
their
ships
which
he
had
taken
away
the
persians
then
sailing
thence
and
pursuing
demokedes
reached
croton
and
finding
him
in
the
they
laid
hands
upon
him
and
some
of
the
men
of
croton
fearing
the
persian
power
were
willing
to
let
him
go
but
others
took
hold
of
him
and
struck
with
their
staves
at
the
persians
who
pleaded
for
themselves
in
these
words
men
of
croton
take
care
what
ye
are
about
ye
are
rescuing
a
man
who
was
a
slave
of
king
dareios
and
who
ran
away
from
him
how
think
you
will
king
dareios
be
content
to
receive
such
an
insult
and
how
shall
this
which
ye
do
be
well
for
you
if
ye
take
him
away
from
us
against
what
city
think
you
shall
we
make
expedition
sooner
than
against
this
and
what
city
before
this
shall
we
endeavour
to
reduce
to
slavery
thus
saying
they
did
not
however
persuade
the
men
of
croton
but
having
had
demokedes
rescued
from
them
and
the
ship
of
burden
which
they
were
bringing
with
them
taken
away
they
set
sail
to
go
back
to
asia
and
did
not
endeavour
to
visit
any
more
parts
of
hellas
or
to
find
out
about
them
being
now
deprived
of
their
guide
this
much
however
demokedes
gave
them
as
a
charge
when
they
were
putting
forth
to
sea
bidding
them
say
to
dareios
that
demokedes
was
betrothed
to
the
daughter
of
milon
for
the
wrestler
milon
had
a
great
name
at
the
king
court
and
i
suppose
that
demokedes
was
urgent
for
this
marriage
spending
much
money
to
further
it
in
order
that
dareios
might
see
that
he
was
held
in
honour
also
in
his
own
country
the
persians
however
after
they
had
put
out
from
croton
were
cast
away
with
their
ships
in
iapygia
and
as
they
were
remaining
there
as
slaves
gillos
a
tarentine
exile
rescued
them
and
brought
them
back
to
king
dareios
in
return
for
this
dareios
offered
to
give
him
whatsoever
thing
he
should
desire
and
gillos
chose
that
he
might
have
the
power
of
returning
to
taras
narrating
first
the
story
of
his
misfortune
and
in
order
that
he
might
not
disturb
all
hellas
as
would
be
the
case
if
on
his
account
a
great
armament
should
sail
to
invade
italy
he
said
it
was
enough
for
him
that
the
men
of
cnidos
should
be
those
who
brought
him
back
without
any
others
because
he
supposed
that
by
these
who
were
friends
with
the
tarentines
his
return
from
exile
would
most
easily
be
effected
dareios
accordingly
having
promised
proceeded
to
perform
for
he
sent
a
message
to
cnidos
and
bade
them
being
back
gillos
to
taras
and
the
men
of
cnidos
obeyed
dareios
but
nevertheless
they
did
not
persuade
the
tarentines
and
they
were
not
strong
enough
to
apply
force
thus
then
it
happened
with
regard
to
these
things
and
these
were
the
first
persians
who
came
from
asia
to
hellas
and
for
the
reason
which
has
been
mentioned
these
were
sent
as
spies
after
this
king
dareios
took
samos
before
all
other
cities
whether
of
hellenes
or
barbarians
and
for
a
cause
which
was
as
follows
cambyses
the
son
of
cyrus
was
marching
upon
egypt
many
hellenes
arrived
in
egypt
some
as
might
be
expected
joining
in
the
campaign
to
make
profit
and
some
also
coming
to
see
the
land
itself
and
among
these
was
syoloson
the
son
of
aiakes
and
brother
of
polycrates
an
exile
from
samos
to
this
syloson
a
fortunate
chance
occurred
which
was
this
had
taken
and
put
upon
him
a
mantle
and
was
about
the
in
memphis
and
dareios
who
was
then
one
of
the
spearmen
of
cambyses
and
not
yet
held
in
any
great
estimation
seeing
him
had
a
desire
for
the
mantle
and
going
up
to
him
offered
to
buy
it
then
syloson
seeing
that
dareios
very
greatly
desired
the
mantle
by
some
divine
inspiration
said
i
will
not
sell
this
for
any
sum
but
i
will
give
it
thee
for
nothing
if
as
it
appears
it
must
be
thine
at
all
costs
to
this
dareios
agreed
and
received
from
him
the
garment
now
syloson
supposed
without
any
doubt
that
he
had
altogether
lost
this
by
easy
simplicity
but
when
in
course
of
time
cambyses
was
dead
and
the
seven
persians
had
risen
up
against
the
magian
and
of
the
seven
dareios
had
obtained
the
kingdom
syloson
heard
that
the
kingdom
had
come
about
to
that
man
to
whom
once
in
egypt
he
had
given
the
garment
at
his
request
accordingly
he
went
up
to
susa
and
sat
down
at
the
entrance
of
the
king
palace
and
said
that
he
was
a
benefactor
of
dareios
the
keeper
of
the
door
hearing
this
reported
it
to
the
king
and
he
marvelled
at
it
and
said
to
him
who
then
of
the
hellenes
is
my
benefactor
to
whom
i
am
bound
by
gratitude
seeing
that
it
is
now
but
a
short
time
that
i
possess
the
kingdom
and
as
yet
scarcely
one
of
them
has
come
up
to
our
court
and
i
may
almost
say
that
i
have
no
debt
owing
to
a
hellene
nevertheless
bring
him
in
before
me
that
i
may
know
what
he
means
when
he
says
these
things
then
the
keeper
of
the
door
brought
syloson
before
him
and
when
he
had
been
set
in
the
midst
the
interpreters
asked
him
who
he
was
and
what
he
had
done
that
he
called
himself
the
benefactor
of
the
king
syloson
accordingly
told
all
that
had
happened
about
the
mantle
and
how
he
was
the
man
who
had
given
it
to
which
dareios
made
answer
o
most
noble
of
men
thou
art
he
who
when
as
yet
i
had
no
power
gavest
me
a
gift
small
it
may
be
but
nevertheless
the
kindness
is
counted
with
me
to
be
as
great
as
if
i
should
now
receive
some
great
thing
from
some
one
therefore
i
will
give
thee
in
return
gold
and
silver
in
abundance
that
thou
mayest
not
ever
repent
that
thou
didst
render
a
service
to
dareios
the
son
of
hystaspes
to
this
syloson
replied
to
me
o
king
give
neither
gold
nor
silver
but
recover
and
give
to
me
my
fatherland
samos
which
now
that
my
brother
polycrates
has
been
slain
by
oroites
is
possessed
by
our
slave
this
give
to
me
without
bloodshed
or
selling
into
slavery
dareios
having
heard
this
prepared
to
send
an
expedition
with
otanes
as
commander
of
it
who
had
been
one
of
the
seven
charging
him
to
accomplish
for
syloson
all
that
which
he
had
requested
otanes
then
went
down
to
the
and
was
preparing
the
expedition
now
maiandrios
the
son
of
maiandrios
was
holding
the
rule
over
samos
having
received
the
government
as
a
trust
from
polycrates
and
he
though
desiring
to
show
himself
the
most
righteous
of
men
did
not
succeed
in
so
doing
for
when
the
death
of
polycrates
was
reported
to
him
he
did
as
follows
he
founded
an
altar
to
zeus
the
liberator
and
marked
out
a
sacred
enclosure
round
it
namely
that
which
exists
still
in
the
suburb
of
the
city
then
after
he
had
done
this
he
gathered
together
an
assembly
of
all
the
citizens
and
spoke
these
words
to
me
as
ye
know
as
well
as
i
has
been
entrusted
the
sceptre
of
polycrates
and
all
his
power
and
now
it
is
open
to
me
to
be
your
ruler
but
that
for
the
doing
of
which
i
find
fault
with
my
neighbour
i
will
myself
refrain
from
doing
so
far
as
i
may
for
as
i
did
not
approve
of
polycrates
acting
as
master
of
men
who
were
not
inferior
to
himself
so
neither
do
i
approve
of
any
other
who
does
such
things
now
polycrates
for
his
part
fulfilled
his
own
appointed
destiny
and
i
now
give
the
power
into
the
hands
of
the
people
and
proclaim
to
you
equality
these
privileges
however
i
think
it
right
to
have
assigned
to
me
namely
that
from
the
wealth
of
polycrates
six
talents
should
be
taken
out
and
given
to
me
as
a
special
gift
and
in
addition
to
this
i
choose
for
myself
and
for
my
descendants
in
succession
the
priesthood
of
zeus
the
liberator
to
whom
i
myself
founded
a
temple
while
i
bestow
liberty
upon
you
he
as
i
say
made
these
offers
to
the
samians
but
one
of
them
rose
up
and
said
nay
but
unworthy
too
art
thou
to
be
our
ruler
seeing
that
thou
art
of
mean
birth
and
a
pestilent
fellow
besides
rather
take
care
that
thou
give
an
account
of
the
money
which
thou
hadst
to
deal
with
thus
said
one
who
was
a
man
of
repute
among
the
citizens
whose
name
was
telesarchos
and
maiandrios
perceiving
that
if
he
resigned
the
power
some
other
would
be
set
up
as
despot
instead
of
himself
did
not
keep
the
purpose
at
all
of
resigning
it
but
having
retired
to
the
fortress
he
sent
for
each
man
separately
pretending
that
he
was
going
to
give
an
account
of
the
money
and
so
seized
them
and
put
them
in
bonds
these
then
had
been
put
in
bonds
but
maiandrios
after
this
was
overtaken
by
sickness
and
his
brother
whose
name
was
lycaretos
expecting
that
he
would
die
put
all
the
prisoners
to
death
in
order
that
he
might
himself
more
easily
get
possession
of
the
power
over
samos
and
all
this
happened
because
as
it
appears
they
did
not
choose
to
be
free
so
when
the
persians
arrived
at
samos
bringing
syloson
home
from
exile
no
one
raised
a
hand
against
them
and
moreover
the
party
of
maiandrios
and
maiandrios
himself
said
that
they
were
ready
to
retire
out
of
the
island
under
a
truce
otanes
therefore
having
agreed
on
these
terms
and
having
made
a
treaty
the
most
honourable
of
the
persians
had
seats
placed
for
them
in
front
of
the
fortress
and
were
sitting
there
now
the
despot
maiandrios
had
a
brother
who
was
somewhat
mad
and
his
name
was
charilaos
this
man
for
some
offence
which
he
had
been
committed
had
been
confined
in
an
underground
dungeon
and
at
this
time
of
which
i
speak
having
heard
what
was
being
done
and
having
put
his
head
through
out
of
the
dungeon
when
he
saw
the
persians
peacefully
sitting
there
he
began
to
cry
out
and
said
that
he
desired
to
come
to
speech
with
maiandrios
so
maiandrios
hearing
his
voice
bade
them
loose
him
and
bring
him
into
his
presence
and
as
soon
as
he
was
brought
he
began
to
abuse
and
revile
him
trying
to
persuade
him
to
attack
the
persians
and
saying
thus
thou
basest
of
men
didst
thou
put
me
in
bonds
and
judge
me
worthy
of
the
dungeon
under
ground
who
am
thine
own
brother
and
did
no
wrong
worthy
of
bonds
and
when
thou
seest
the
persians
casting
thee
forth
from
the
land
and
making
thee
homeless
dost
thou
not
dare
to
take
any
revenge
though
they
are
so
exceedingly
easy
to
be
overcome
nay
but
if
in
truth
thou
art
afraid
of
them
give
me
thy
mercenaries
and
i
will
take
vengeance
on
them
for
their
coming
here
and
thyself
i
am
willing
to
let
go
out
of
the
island
thus
spoke
charilaos
and
maiandrios
accepted
that
which
he
said
not
as
i
think
because
he
had
reached
such
a
height
of
folly
as
to
suppose
that
his
own
power
would
overcome
that
of
the
king
but
rather
because
he
grudged
syloson
that
he
should
receive
from
him
the
state
without
trouble
and
with
no
injury
inflicted
upon
it
therefore
he
desired
to
provoke
the
persians
to
anger
and
make
the
samian
power
as
feeble
as
possible
before
he
gave
it
up
to
him
being
well
assured
that
the
persians
when
they
had
suffered
evil
would
be
likely
to
be
as
bitter
against
the
samians
as
well
as
against
those
who
did
the
wrong
and
knowing
also
that
he
had
a
safe
way
of
escape
from
the
island
whenever
he
desired
for
he
had
had
a
secret
passage
made
under
ground
leading
from
the
fortress
to
the
sea
maiandrios
then
himself
sailed
out
from
samos
but
charilaos
armed
all
the
mercenaries
and
opening
wide
the
gates
sent
them
out
upon
the
persians
who
were
not
expecting
any
such
thing
but
supposed
that
all
had
been
arranged
and
the
mercenaries
falling
upon
them
began
to
slay
those
of
the
persians
who
had
seats
carried
for
them
and
were
of
most
account
while
these
were
thus
engaged
the
rest
of
the
persian
force
came
to
the
rescue
and
the
mercenaries
were
hard
pressed
and
forced
to
retire
to
the
fortress
then
otanes
the
persian
commander
seeing
that
the
persians
had
suffered
greatly
purposely
forgot
the
commands
which
dareios
gave
him
when
he
sent
him
forth
not
to
kill
any
one
of
the
samians
nor
to
sell
any
into
slavery
but
to
restore
the
island
to
syloson
free
from
all
suffering
of
calamity
commands
i
say
he
purposely
forgot
and
gave
the
word
to
his
army
to
slay
every
one
whom
they
should
take
man
or
boy
without
distinction
so
while
some
of
the
army
were
besieging
the
fortress
others
were
slaying
every
one
who
came
in
their
way
in
sanctuary
or
out
of
sanctuary
equally
meanwhile
maiandrios
had
escaped
from
samos
and
was
sailing
to
lacedemon
and
having
come
thither
and
caused
to
be
brought
up
to
the
city
the
things
which
he
had
taken
with
him
when
he
departed
he
did
as
follows
he
would
set
out
his
cups
of
silver
and
of
gold
and
then
while
the
servants
were
cleaning
them
he
would
be
engaged
in
conversation
with
cleomenes
the
son
of
anaxandrides
then
king
of
sparta
and
would
bring
him
on
to
his
house
and
when
cleomenes
saw
the
cups
he
marvelled
and
was
astonished
at
them
and
maiandrios
would
bid
him
take
away
with
him
as
many
of
them
as
he
pleased
maiandrios
said
this
twice
or
three
times
but
cleomenes
herein
showed
himself
the
most
upright
of
men
for
he
not
only
did
not
think
fit
to
take
that
which
was
offered
but
perceiving
that
maiandrios
would
make
presents
to
others
of
the
citizens
and
so
obtain
assistance
for
himself
he
went
to
the
ephors
and
said
that
it
was
better
for
sparta
that
the
stranger
of
samos
should
depart
from
peloponnesus
lest
he
might
persuade
either
himself
or
some
other
man
of
the
spartans
to
act
basely
they
accordingly
accepted
his
counsel
and
expelled
maiandrios
by
proclamation
as
to
samos
the
persians
after
sweeping
the
population
off
it
delivered
it
to
syloson
stripped
of
men
afterwards
however
the
commander
otanes
even
joined
in
settling
people
there
moved
by
a
vision
of
a
dream
and
by
a
disease
which
seized
him
so
that
he
was
diseased
in
the
genital
organs
after
a
naval
force
had
thus
gone
against
samos
the
babylonians
made
revolt
being
for
this
exceedingly
well
prepared
for
during
all
the
time
of
the
reign
of
the
magian
and
of
the
insurrection
of
the
seven
during
all
this
time
and
the
attendant
confusion
they
were
preparing
themselves
for
the
siege
of
their
city
and
it
chanced
by
some
means
that
they
were
not
observed
to
be
doing
this
then
when
they
made
open
revolt
they
did
as
follows
setting
apart
their
mothers
first
each
man
set
apart
also
for
himself
one
woman
whosoever
he
wished
of
his
own
household
and
all
the
remainder
they
gathered
together
and
killed
by
suffocation
each
man
set
apart
the
one
who
has
been
mentioned
to
serve
as
a
maker
of
bread
and
they
suffocated
the
rest
in
order
that
they
might
not
consume
their
provisions
dareios
being
informed
of
this
and
having
gathered
together
all
his
power
made
expedition
against
them
and
when
he
had
marched
his
army
up
to
babylon
he
began
to
besiege
them
but
they
cared
nothing
about
the
siege
for
the
babylonians
used
to
go
up
to
the
battlements
of
the
wall
and
show
contempt
of
dareios
and
of
his
army
by
gestures
and
by
words
and
one
of
them
uttered
this
saying
why
o
persians
do
ye
remain
sitting
here
and
not
depart
for
then
only
shall
ye
capture
us
when
mules
shall
bring
forth
young
this
was
said
by
one
of
the
babylonians
not
supposing
that
a
mule
would
ever
bring
forth
young
so
when
a
year
and
seven
months
had
now
passed
by
dareios
began
to
be
vexed
and
his
whole
army
with
him
not
being
able
to
conquer
the
babylonians
and
yet
dareios
had
used
against
them
every
kind
of
device
and
every
possible
means
but
not
even
so
could
he
conquer
them
though
besides
other
devices
he
had
attempted
it
by
that
also
with
which
cyrus
conquered
them
but
the
babylonians
were
terribly
on
their
guard
and
he
was
not
able
to
conquer
them
then
in
the
twentieth
month
there
happened
to
zopyros
the
son
of
that
megabyzos
who
had
been
of
the
seven
men
who
slew
the
magian
to
this
zopyros
i
say
son
of
megabyzos
there
happened
a
prodigy
of
the
mules
which
served
as
bearers
of
provisions
for
him
produced
young
and
when
this
was
reported
to
him
and
zopyros
had
himself
seen
the
foal
because
he
did
not
believe
the
report
he
charged
those
who
had
seen
it
not
to
tell
that
which
had
happened
to
any
one
and
he
considered
with
himself
what
to
do
and
having
regard
to
the
words
spoken
by
the
babylonian
who
had
said
at
first
that
when
mules
should
produce
young
then
the
wall
would
be
taken
having
regard
i
say
to
this
ominous
saying
it
seemed
to
zopyros
that
babylon
could
be
taken
for
he
thought
that
both
the
man
had
spoken
and
his
mule
had
produced
young
by
divine
dispensation
since
then
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
was
now
fated
that
babylon
should
be
captured
he
went
to
dareios
and
inquired
of
him
whether
he
thought
it
a
matter
of
very
great
moment
to
conquer
babylon
and
hearing
in
answer
that
he
thought
it
of
great
consequence
he
considered
again
how
he
might
be
the
man
to
take
it
and
how
the
work
might
be
his
own
for
among
the
persians
benefits
are
accounted
worthy
of
a
very
high
degree
of
honour
he
considered
accordingly
that
he
was
not
able
to
make
conquest
of
it
by
any
other
means
but
only
if
he
should
maltreat
himself
and
desert
to
their
side
so
making
light
esteem
of
himself
he
maltreated
his
own
body
in
a
manner
which
could
not
be
cured
for
he
cut
off
his
nose
and
his
ears
and
shaved
his
hair
round
in
an
unseemly
way
and
scourged
himself
and
so
went
into
the
presence
of
dareios
and
dareios
was
exceedingly
troubled
when
he
saw
the
man
of
most
repute
with
him
thus
maltreated
and
leaping
up
from
his
seat
he
cried
aloud
and
asked
him
who
was
the
person
who
had
maltreated
him
and
for
what
deed
he
replied
that
man
does
not
exist
excepting
thee
who
has
so
great
power
as
to
bring
me
into
this
condition
and
not
any
stranger
o
king
has
done
this
but
i
myself
to
myself
accounting
it
a
very
grievous
thing
that
the
assyrians
should
make
a
mock
of
the
persians
he
made
answer
thou
most
reckless
of
men
thou
didst
set
the
fairest
name
to
the
foulest
deed
when
thou
saidest
that
on
account
of
those
who
are
besieged
thou
didst
bring
thyself
into
a
condition
which
can
not
be
cured
how
o
thou
senseless
one
will
the
enemy
surrender
to
us
more
quickly
because
thou
hast
maltreated
thyself
surely
thou
didst
wander
out
of
thy
senses
in
thus
destroying
thyself
and
he
said
if
i
had
communicated
to
thee
that
which
i
was
about
to
do
thou
wouldst
not
have
permitted
me
to
do
it
but
as
it
was
i
did
it
on
my
own
account
now
therefore
unless
something
is
wanting
on
thy
part
we
shall
conquer
babylon
for
i
shall
go
straightway
as
a
deserter
to
the
wall
and
i
shall
say
to
them
that
i
suffered
this
treatment
at
thy
hands
and
i
think
that
when
i
have
convinced
them
that
this
is
so
i
shall
obtain
the
command
of
a
part
of
their
forces
do
thou
then
on
the
tenth
day
from
that
on
which
i
shall
enter
within
the
wall
take
of
those
troops
about
which
thou
wilt
have
no
concern
if
they
be
destroyed
these
i
say
get
a
thousand
by
the
gate
of
the
city
which
is
called
the
gate
of
semiramis
and
after
this
again
on
the
seventh
day
after
the
tenth
set
i
pray
thee
two
thousand
by
the
gate
which
is
called
the
gate
of
the
ninevites
and
after
this
seventh
day
let
twenty
days
elapse
and
then
lead
other
four
thousand
and
place
them
by
the
gate
called
the
gate
of
the
chaldeans
and
let
neither
the
former
men
nor
these
have
any
weapons
to
defend
them
except
daggers
but
this
weapon
let
them
have
then
after
the
twentieth
day
at
once
bid
the
rest
of
the
army
make
an
attack
on
the
wall
all
round
and
set
the
persians
i
pray
thee
by
those
gates
which
are
called
the
gate
of
belos
and
the
gate
of
kissia
for
as
i
think
when
i
have
displayed
great
deeds
of
prowess
the
babylonians
will
entrust
to
me
besides
their
other
things
also
the
keys
which
draw
the
bolts
of
the
gates
then
after
that
it
shall
be
the
care
of
myself
and
the
persians
to
do
that
which
ought
to
be
done
having
thus
enjoined
he
proceeded
to
go
to
the
gate
of
the
city
turning
to
look
behind
him
as
he
went
as
if
he
were
in
truth
a
deserter
and
those
who
were
set
in
that
part
of
the
wall
seeing
him
from
the
towers
ran
down
and
slightly
opening
one
wing
of
the
gate
asked
who
he
was
and
for
what
purpose
he
had
come
and
he
addressed
them
and
said
that
he
was
zopyros
and
that
he
came
as
a
deserter
to
them
the
accordingly
when
they
heard
this
led
him
to
the
public
assembly
of
the
babylonians
and
being
introduced
before
it
he
began
to
lament
his
fortunes
saying
that
he
had
in
fact
suffered
at
his
own
hands
and
that
he
had
suffered
this
because
he
had
counselled
the
king
to
withdraw
his
army
since
in
truth
there
seemed
to
be
no
means
of
taking
the
town
and
now
he
went
on
to
say
i
am
come
for
very
great
good
to
you
o
babylonians
but
for
very
great
evil
to
dareios
and
his
army
and
to
the
persians
for
he
shall
surely
not
escape
with
impunity
for
having
thus
maltreated
me
and
i
know
all
the
courses
of
his
counsels
thus
he
spoke
and
the
babylonians
when
they
saw
the
man
of
most
reputation
among
the
persians
deprived
of
nose
and
ears
and
smeared
over
with
blood
from
scourging
supposing
assuredly
that
he
was
speaking
the
truth
and
had
come
to
be
their
helper
were
ready
to
put
in
his
power
that
for
which
he
asked
them
and
he
asked
them
that
he
might
command
a
certain
force
then
when
he
had
obtained
this
from
them
he
did
that
which
he
had
agreed
with
dareios
that
he
would
do
for
he
led
out
on
the
tenth
day
the
army
of
the
babylonians
and
having
surrounded
the
thousand
men
whom
he
had
enjoined
dareios
first
to
set
there
he
slew
them
the
babylonians
accordingly
perceiving
that
the
deeds
which
he
displayed
were
in
accordance
with
his
words
were
very
greatly
rejoiced
and
were
ready
to
serve
him
in
all
things
and
after
the
lapse
of
the
days
which
had
been
agreed
upon
he
again
chose
men
of
the
babylonians
and
led
them
out
and
slew
the
two
thousand
men
of
the
troops
of
dareios
seeing
this
deed
also
the
babylonians
all
had
the
name
of
zopyros
upon
their
tongues
and
were
loud
in
his
praise
he
then
again
after
the
lapse
of
the
days
which
had
been
agreed
upon
led
them
out
to
the
place
appointed
and
surrounded
the
four
thousand
and
slew
them
when
this
also
had
been
done
zopyros
was
everything
among
the
babylonians
and
he
was
appointed
both
commander
of
their
army
and
guardian
of
their
walls
but
when
dareios
made
an
attack
according
to
the
agreement
on
every
side
of
the
wall
then
zopyros
discovered
all
his
craft
for
while
the
babylonians
having
gone
up
on
the
wall
were
defending
themselves
against
the
attacks
of
the
army
of
dareios
zopyros
opened
the
gates
called
the
gates
of
kissia
and
of
belos
and
let
in
the
persians
within
the
wall
and
of
the
babylonians
those
who
saw
that
which
was
done
fled
to
the
temple
of
zeus
belos
but
those
who
did
not
see
remained
each
in
his
own
appointed
place
until
at
last
they
also
learnt
that
they
had
been
betrayed
thus
was
babylon
conquered
for
the
second
time
and
dareios
when
he
had
overcome
the
babylonians
first
took
away
the
wall
from
round
their
city
and
pulled
down
all
the
gates
for
when
cyrus
took
babylon
before
him
he
did
neither
of
these
things
and
secondly
dareios
impaled
the
leading
men
to
the
number
of
about
three
thousand
but
to
the
rest
of
the
babylonians
he
gave
back
their
city
to
dwell
in
and
to
provide
that
the
babylonians
should
have
wives
in
order
that
their
race
might
be
propagated
dareios
did
as
follows
for
their
own
wives
as
has
been
declared
at
the
beginning
the
babylonians
had
suffocated
in
provident
care
for
their
store
of
food
ordered
the
nations
who
dwelt
round
to
bring
women
to
babylon
fixing
a
certain
number
for
each
nation
so
that
the
sum
total
of
fifty
thousand
women
was
brought
together
and
from
these
women
the
present
babylonians
are
descended
as
for
zopyros
in
the
judgment
of
dareios
no
one
of
the
persians
surpassed
him
in
good
service
either
of
those
who
came
after
or
of
those
who
had
gone
before
excepting
cyrus
alone
for
to
cyrus
no
man
of
the
persians
ever
yet
ventured
to
compare
himself
and
dareios
is
said
to
have
declared
often
that
he
would
rather
that
zopyros
were
free
from
the
injury
than
that
he
should
have
twenty
babylons
added
to
his
possession
in
addition
to
that
one
which
he
had
moreover
he
gave
him
great
honours
for
not
only
did
he
give
him
every
year
those
things
which
by
the
persians
are
accounted
the
most
honourable
but
also
he
granted
him
babylon
to
rule
free
from
tribute
so
long
as
he
should
live
and
he
added
many
other
gifts
the
son
of
this
zopyros
was
megabyzos
who
was
made
commander
in
egypt
against
the
athenians
and
their
allies
and
the
son
of
this
megabyzos
was

iv
the

of
the
histories
called

after
babylon
had
been
taken
the
march
of
dareios
himself
against
the
scythians
took
place
for
now
that
asia
was
flourishing
in
respect
of
population
and
large
sums
were
being
gathered
in
as
revenue
dareios
formed
the
desire
to
take
vengeance
upon
the
scythians
because
they
had
first
invaded
the
median
land
and
had
overcome
in
fight
those
who
opposed
them
and
thus
they
had
been
the
beginners
of
wrong
the
scythians
in
truth
as
i
have
before
said
had
ruled
over
upper
asia
for
years
for
they
had
invaded
asia
in
their
pursuit
of
the
kimmerians
and
they
had
deposed
the
medes
from
their
rule
who
had
rule
over
asia
before
the
scythians
came
now
when
the
scythians
had
been
absent
from
their
own
land
for
years
as
they
were
returning
to
it
after
that
interval
of
time
they
were
met
by
a
contest
not
less
severe
than
that
which
they
had
had
with
the
medes
since
they
found
an
army
of
no
mean
size
opposing
them
for
the
wives
of
the
scythians
because
their
husbands
were
absent
from
them
for
a
long
time
had
associated
with
the
slaves
now
the
scythians
put
out
the
eyes
of
all
their
slaves
because
of
the
milk
which
they
drink
and
they
do
as
follows
take
of
bone
just
like
flutes
and
these
they
insert
into
the
vagina
of
the
mare
and
blow
with
their
mouths
and
others
milk
while
they
blow
and
they
say
that
they
do
this
because
the
veins
of
the
mare
are
thus
filled
being
blown
out
and
so
the
udder
is
let
down
when
they
had
drawn
the
milk
they
pour
it
into
wooden
vessels
hollowed
out
and
they
set
the
blind
slaves
in
order
about
the
vessels
and
agitate
the
milk
then
that
which
comes
to
the
top
they
skim
off
considering
it
the
more
valuable
part
whereas
they
esteem
that
which
settles
down
to
be
less
good
than
the
other
for
this
reason
the
scythians
put
out
the
eyes
of
all
whom
they
catch
for
they
are
not
tillers
of
the
soil
but
nomads
from
these
their
slaves
then
i
say
and
from
their
wives
had
been
born
and
bred
up
a
generation
of
young
men
who
having
learnt
the
manner
of
their
birth
set
themselves
to
oppose
the
scythians
as
they
were
returning
from
the
medes
and
first
they
cut
off
their
land
by
digging
a
broad
trench
extending
from
the
tauric
mountains
to
the
maiotian
lake
at
the
point
where
this
is
broadest
then
afterwards
when
the
scythians
attempted
to
invade
the
land
they
took
up
a
position
against
them
and
fought
and
as
they
fought
many
times
and
the
scythians
were
not
able
to
get
any
advantage
in
the
fighting
one
of
them
said
what
a
thing
is
this
that
we
are
doing
scythians
we
are
fighting
against
our
own
slaves
and
we
are
not
only
becoming
fewer
in
number
ourselves
by
being
slain
in
battle
but
also
we
are
killing
them
and
so
we
shall
have
fewer
to
rule
over
in
future
now
therefore
to
me
it
seems
good
that
we
leave
spears
and
bows
and
that
each
one
take
his
and
so
go
up
close
to
them
for
so
long
as
they
saw
us
with
arms
in
our
hands
they
thought
themselves
equal
to
us
and
of
equal
birth
but
when
they
shall
see
that
we
have
whips
instead
of
arms
they
will
perceive
that
they
are
our
slaves
and
having
acknowledged
this
they
will
not
await
our
onset
when
they
heard
this
the
scythians
proceeded
to
do
that
which
he
said
and
the
others
being
by
that
which
was
done
forgot
their
fighting
and
fled
thus
the
scythians
had
ruled
over
asia
and
in
such
manner
when
they
were
driven
out
again
by
the
medes
they
had
returned
to
their
own
land
for
this
dareios
wished
to
take
vengeance
upon
them
and
was
gathering
together
an
army
to
go
against
them
now
the
scythians
say
that
their
nation
is
the
youngest
of
all
nations
and
that
this
came
to
pass
as
follows
first
man
who
ever
existed
in
this
region
which
then
was
desert
was
one
named
targitaos
and
of
this
targitaos
they
say
though
i
do
not
believe
it
for
my
part
however
they
say
the
parents
were
zeus
and
the
daughter
of
the
river
borysthenes
targitaos
they
report
was
produced
from
some
such
origin
as
this
and
of
him
were
begotten
three
sons
lipoxaïs
and
arpoxaïs
and
the
youngest
colaxaïs
in
the
reign
of
these
there
came
down
from
heaven
certain
things
wrought
of
gold
a
plough
a
yoke
a
and
a
cup
and
fell
in
the
scythian
land
and
first
the
eldest
saw
and
came
near
them
desiring
to
take
them
but
the
gold
blazed
with
fire
when
he
approached
it
then
when
he
had
gone
away
from
it
the
second
approached
and
again
it
did
the
same
thing
these
then
the
gold
repelled
by
blazing
with
fire
but
when
the
third
and
youngest
came
up
to
it
the
flame
was
quenched
and
he
carried
them
to
his
own
house
the
elder
brothers
then
acknowledging
the
significance
of
this
thing
delivered
the
whole
of
the
kingly
power
to
the
youngest
from
lixopaïs
they
say
are
descended
those
scythians
who
are
called
the
race
of
the
auchatai
from
the
middle
brother
arpoxaïs
those
who
are
called
catiaroi
and
traspians
and
from
the
youngest
of
them
the
royal
tribe
who
are
called
paralatai
and
the
whole
together
are
called
they
say
scolotoi
after
the
name
of
their
king
but
the
hellenes
gave
them
the
name
of
scythians
thus
the
scythians
say
they
were
produced
and
from
the
time
of
their
origin
that
is
to
say
from
the
first
king
targitaos
to
the
passing
over
of
dareios
against
them
they
say
that
there
is
a
period
of
a
thousand
years
and
no
more
now
this
sacred
gold
is
guarded
by
the
kings
with
the
utmost
care
and
they
visit
it
every
year
with
solemn
sacrifices
of
propitiation
moreover
if
any
one
goes
to
sleep
while
watching
in
the
open
air
over
this
gold
during
the
festival
the
scythians
say
that
he
does
not
live
out
the
year
and
there
is
given
him
for
this
so
much
land
as
he
shall
ride
round
himself
on
his
horse
in
one
day
now
as
the
land
was
large
colaxaïs
they
say
established
three
kingdoms
for
his
sons
and
of
these
he
made
one
larger
than
the
rest
and
in
this
the
gold
is
kept
but
as
to
the
upper
parts
which
lie
on
the
north
side
of
those
who
dwell
above
this
land
they
say
one
can
neither
see
nor
pass
through
any
further
by
reason
of
feathers
which
are
poured
down
for
both
the
earth
and
the
air
are
full
of
feathers
and
this
is
that
which
shuts
off
the
view
thus
say
the
scythians
about
themselves
and
about
the
region
above
them
but
the
hellenes
who
dwell
about
the
pontus
say
as
follows
driving
the
cattle
of
geryones
came
to
this
land
then
desert
which
the
scythians
now
inhabit
and
geryones
says
the
tale
dwelt
away
from
the
region
of
the
pontus
living
in
the
island
called
by
the
hellenes
erytheia
near
gadeira
which
is
outside
the
pillars
of
heracles
by
the
to
the
ocean
they
say
indeed
that
it
flows
round
the
whole
earth
beginning
from
the
place
of
the
sunrising
but
they
do
not
prove
this
by
thence
heracles
came
to
the
land
now
called
scythia
and
as
a
storm
came
upon
him
together
with
icy
cold
he
drew
over
him
his
lion
skin
and
went
to
sleep
meanwhile
the
mares
harnessed
in
his
chariot
disappeared
by
a
miraculous
chance
as
they
were
feeding
then
when
heracles
woke
he
sought
for
them
and
having
gone
over
the
whole
land
at
last
he
came
to
the
region
which
is
called
hylaia
and
there
he
found
in
a
cave
a
kind
of
twofold
creature
formed
by
the
union
of
a
maiden
and
a
serpent
whose
upper
parts
from
the
buttocks
upwards
were
those
of
a
woman
but
her
lower
parts
were
those
of
a
snake
having
seen
her
and
marvelled
at
her
he
asked
her
then
whether
she
had
seen
any
mares
straying
anywhere
and
she
said
that
she
had
them
herself
and
would
not
give
them
up
until
he
lay
with
her
and
heracles
lay
with
her
on
condition
of
receiving
them
she
then
tried
to
put
off
the
giving
back
of
the
mares
desiring
to
have
heracles
with
her
as
long
as
possible
while
he
on
the
other
hand
desired
to
get
the
mares
and
depart
and
at
last
she
gave
them
back
and
said
these
mares
when
they
came
hither
i
saved
for
thee
and
thou
didst
give
me
reward
for
saving
them
for
i
have
by
thee
three
sons
tell
me
then
what
must
i
do
with
these
when
they
shall
be
grown
to
manhood
whether
i
shall
settle
them
here
for
over
this
land
i
have
power
alone
or
send
them
away
to
thee
she
thus
asked
of
him
and
he
they
say
replied
when
thou
seest
that
the
boys
are
grown
to
men
do
this
and
thou
shalt
not
fail
of
doing
right
of
them
thou
seest
able
to
stretch
this
bow
as
i
do
now
and
to
be
girded
with
this
girdle
him
cause
to
be
the
settler
of
this
land
but
whosoever
of
them
fails
in
the
deeds
which
i
enjoin
send
him
forth
out
of
the
land
and
if
thou
shalt
do
thus
thou
wilt
both
have
delight
thyself
and
perform
that
which
has
been
enjoined
to
thee
upon
this
he
drew
one
of
his
bows
for
up
to
that
time
heracles
they
say
was
wont
to
carry
two
and
showed
her
the
girdle
and
then
he
delivered
to
her
both
the
bow
and
the
girdle
which
had
at
the
end
of
its
clasp
a
golden
cup
and
having
given
them
he
departed
she
then
when
her
sons
had
been
born
and
had
grown
to
be
men
gave
them
names
first
calling
one
of
them
agathyrsos
and
the
next
gelonos
and
the
youngest
skythes
then
bearing
in
mind
the
charge
given
to
her
she
did
that
which
was
enjoined
and
two
of
her
sons
agathyrsos
and
gelonos
not
having
proved
themselves
able
to
attain
to
the
task
set
before
them
departed
from
the
land
being
cast
out
by
her
who
bore
them
but
skythes
the
youngest
of
them
performed
the
task
and
remained
in
the
land
and
from
skythes
the
son
of
heracles
were
descended
they
say
the
succeeding
kings
of
the
scythians
skythians
and
they
say
moreover
that
it
is
by
reason
of
the
cup
that
the
scythians
still
even
to
this
day
wear
cups
attached
to
their
girdles
and
this
alone
his
mother
contrived
for
skythes
such
is
the
story
told
by
the
hellenes
who
dwell
about
the
pontus
there
is
however
also
another
story
which
is
as
follows
and
to
this
i
am
most
inclined
myself
it
is
to
the
effect
that
the
nomad
scythians
dwelling
in
asia
being
hard
pressed
in
war
by
the
massagetai
left
their
abode
and
crossing
the
river
araxes
came
towards
the
kimmerian
land
for
the
land
which
now
is
occupied
by
the
scythians
is
said
to
have
been
in
former
times
the
land
of
the
kimmerians
and
the
kimmerians
when
the
scythians
were
coming
against
them
took
counsel
together
seeing
that
a
great
host
was
coming
to
fight
against
them
and
it
proved
that
their
opinions
were
divided
both
opinions
being
vehemently
maintained
but
the
better
being
that
of
their
kings
for
the
opinion
of
the
people
was
that
it
was
necessary
to
depart
and
that
they
ought
not
to
run
the
risk
of
fighting
against
so
many
but
that
of
the
kings
was
to
fight
for
their
land
with
those
who
came
against
them
and
as
neither
the
people
were
willing
by
means
to
agree
to
the
counsel
of
the
kings
nor
the
kings
to
that
of
the
people
the
people
planned
to
depart
without
fighting
and
to
deliver
up
the
land
to
the
invaders
while
the
kings
resolved
to
die
and
to
be
laid
in
their
own
land
and
not
to
flee
with
the
mass
of
the
people
considering
the
many
goods
of
fortune
which
they
had
enjoyed
and
the
many
evils
which
it
might
be
supposed
would
come
upon
them
if
they
fled
from
their
native
land
having
resolved
upon
this
they
parted
into
two
bodies
and
making
their
numbers
equal
they
fought
with
one
another
and
when
these
had
all
been
killed
by
one
another
hands
then
the
people
of
the
kimmerians
buried
them
by
the
bank
of
the
river
tyras
where
their
is
still
to
be
seen
and
having
buried
them
then
they
made
their
way
out
from
the
land
and
the
scythians
when
they
came
upon
it
found
the
land
deserted
of
its
inhabitants
and
there
are
at
the
present
time
in
the
land
of
scythia
kimmerian
walls
and
a
kimmerian
ferry
and
there
is
also
a
region
which
is
called
kimmeria
and
the
kimmerian
bosphorus
it
is
known
moreover
that
the
kimmerians
in
their
flight
to
asia
from
the
scythians
also
made
a
settlement
on
that
peninsula
on
which
now
stands
the
hellenic
city
of
sinope
and
it
is
known
too
that
the
scythians
pursued
them
and
invaded
the
land
of
media
having
missed
their
way
for
while
the
kimmerians
kept
ever
along
by
the
sea
in
their
flight
the
scythians
pursued
them
keeping
caucasus
on
their
right
hand
until
at
last
they
invaded
media
directing
their
course
inland
this
then
which
has
been
told
is
another
story
and
it
is
common
both
to
hellenes
and
barbarians
aristeas
however
the
son
of
caÿstrobios
a
man
of
proconnesos
said
in
the
verses
which
he
composed
that
he
came
to
the
land
of
the
issedonians
being
possessed
by
phoebus
and
that
beyond
the
issedonians
dwelt
arimaspians
a
race
and
beyond
these
the
griffins
and
beyond
them
the
hyperboreans
extending
as
far
as
the
sea
and
all
these
except
the
hyperboreans
beginning
with
the
arimaspians
were
continually
making
war
on
their
neighbours
and
the
issedonians
were
gradually
driven
out
of
their
country
by
the
arimaspians
and
the
scythians
by
the
issedonians
and
so
the
kimmerians
who
dwelt
on
the
southern
sea
being
pressed
by
the
scythians
left
their
land
thus
neither
does
he
agree
in
regard
to
this
land
with
the
report
of
the
scythians
as
to
aristeas
who
composed
this
i
have
said
already
whence
he
was
and
i
will
tell
also
the
tale
which
i
heard
about
him
in
proconnesos
and
kyzicos
they
say
that
aristeas
who
was
in
birth
inferior
to
none
of
the
citizens
entered
into
a
fuller
shop
in
proconnesos
and
there
died
and
the
fuller
closed
his
workshop
and
went
away
to
report
the
matter
to
those
who
were
related
to
the
dead
man
and
when
the
news
had
been
spread
abroad
about
the
city
that
aristeas
was
dead
a
man
of
kyzicos
who
had
come
from
the
town
of
artake
entered
into
controversy
with
those
who
said
so
and
declared
that
he
had
met
him
going
towards
kyzicos
and
had
spoken
with
him
and
while
he
was
vehement
in
dispute
those
who
were
related
to
the
dead
man
came
to
the
shop
with
the
things
proper
in
order
to
take
up
the
corpse
for
burial
and
when
the
house
was
opened
aristeas
was
not
found
there
either
dead
or
alive
in
the
seventh
year
after
this
he
appeared
at
proconnesos
and
composed
those
verses
which
are
now
called
by
the
hellenes
the
arimaspeia
and
having
composed
them
he
disappeared
the
second
time
so
much
is
told
by
these
cities
and
what
follows
i
know
happened
to
the
people
of
metapontion
in
italy
two
hundred
and
forty
years
after
the
second
disappearance
of
aristeas
as
i
found
by
putting
together
the
evidence
at
proconnesos
and
metapontion
the
people
of
metapontion
say
that
aristeas
himself
appeared
in
their
land
and
bade
them
set
up
an
altar
of
apollo
and
place
by
its
side
a
statue
bearing
the
name
of
aristeas
of
proconnesos
for
he
told
them
that
to
their
land
alone
of
all
the
italiotes
apollo
had
come
and
he
who
now
was
aristeas
was
accompanying
him
being
then
a
raven
when
he
accompanied
the
god
having
said
this
he
disappeared
and
the
metapontines
say
that
they
sent
to
delphi
and
asked
the
god
what
the
apparition
of
the
man
meant
and
the
pythian
prophetess
bade
them
obey
the
command
of
the
apparition
and
told
them
that
if
they
obeyed
it
would
be
the
better
for
them
they
therefore
accepted
this
answer
and
performed
the
commands
and
there
stands
a
statue
now
bearing
the
name
of
aristeas
close
by
the
side
of
the
altar
dedicated
to
apollo
and
round
it
stand
laurel
trees
and
the
altar
is
set
up
in
the
let
this
suffice
which
has
been
said
about
aristeas
now
of
the
land
about
which
this
account
has
been
begun
no
one
knows
precisely
what
lies
beyond
it
for
i
am
not
able
to
hear
of
any
one
who
alleges
that
he
knows
as
an
and
even
aristeas
the
man
of
whom
i
was
making
mention
just
now
even
he
i
say
did
not
allege
although
he
was
composing
verse
that
he
went
further
than
the
issedonians
but
that
which
is
beyond
them
he
spoke
of
by
hearsay
and
reported
that
it
was
the
issedonians
who
said
these
things
so
far
however
as
we
were
able
to
arrive
at
certainty
by
hearsay
carrying
inquiries
as
far
as
possible
all
this
shall
be
told
beginning
with
the
trading
station
of
the
borysthenites
of
the
parts
along
the
sea
this
is
the
central
point
of
all
scythia
with
this
the
first
regions
are
occupied
by
the
callipidai
who
are
hellenic
scythians
and
above
these
is
another
race
who
are
called
alazonians
these
last
and
the
callipidai
in
all
other
respects
have
the
same
customs
as
the
scythians
but
they
both
sow
corn
and
use
it
as
food
and
also
onions
leeks
lentils
and
millet
above
the
alazonians
dwell
scythians
who
till
the
ground
and
these
sow
their
corn
not
for
food
but
to
sell
them
dwell
the
neuroi
and
beyond
the
neuroi
towards
the
north
wind
is
a
region
without
inhabitants
as
far
as
we
know
these
races
are
along
the
river
hypanis
to
the
west
of
the
borysthenes
but
after
crossing
the
borysthenes
first
from
the
is
hylaia
and
beyond
this
as
one
goes
up
the
river
dwell
agricultural
scythians
whom
the
hellenes
who
live
upon
the
river
hypanis
call
borysthenites
calling
themselves
at
the
same
time
citizens
of
olbia
these
agricultural
scythians
occupy
the
region
which
extends
eastwards
for
a
distance
of
three
days
journey
reaching
to
a
river
which
is
called
panticapes
and
northwards
for
a
distance
of
eleven
days
sail
up
the
borysthenes
then
immediately
beyond
these
begins
the
desert
and
extends
for
a
great
distance
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
desert
dwell
the
androphagoi
a
race
apart
by
themselves
and
having
no
connection
with
the
scythians
beyond
them
begins
a
region
which
is
really
desert
and
has
no
race
of
men
in
it
as
far
as
we
know
the
region
which
lies
to
the
east
of
these
agricultural
scythians
after
one
has
crossed
the
river
panticapes
is
occupied
by
nomad
scythians
who
neither
sow
anything
nor
plough
the
earth
and
this
whole
region
is
bare
of
trees
except
hylaia
these
nomads
occupy
a
country
which
extends
to
the
river
gerros
a
distance
of
fourteen
journey
eastwards
then
on
the
other
side
of
the
gerros
we
have
those
parts
which
are
called
the
royal
lands
and
those
scythians
who
are
the
bravest
and
most
numerous
and
who
esteem
the
other
scythians
their
slaves
these
reach
southwards
to
the
tauric
land
and
eastwards
to
the
trench
which
those
who
were
begotten
of
the
blind
slaves
dug
and
to
the
trading
station
which
is
called
cremnoi
upon
the
maiotian
lake
and
some
parts
of
their
country
reach
to
the
river
tanaïs
beyond
the
royal
scythians
towards
the
north
wind
dwell
the
melanchlainoi
of
a
different
race
and
not
scythian
the
region
beyond
the
melanchlainoi
is
marshy
and
not
inhabited
by
any
so
far
as
we
know
after
one
has
crossed
the
river
tanaïs
the
country
is
no
longer
scythia
but
the
first
of
the
divisions
belongs
to
the
sauromatai
who
beginning
at
the
corner
of
the
maiotian
lake
occupy
land
extending
towards
the
north
wind
fifteen
days
journey
and
wholly
bare
of
trees
both
cultivated
and
wild
above
these
holding
the
next
division
of
land
dwell
the
budinoi
who
occupy
a
land
wholly
overgrown
with
forest
consisting
of
all
kinds
of
trees
then
beyond
the
budinoi
towards
the
north
first
there
is
desert
for
seven
days
journey
and
after
the
desert
turning
aside
somewhat
more
towards
the
east
wind
we
come
to
land
occupied
by
the
thyssagetai
a
numerous
people
and
of
separate
race
from
the
others
these
live
by
hunting
and
bordering
upon
them
there
are
settled
also
in
these
same
regions
men
who
are
called
irycai
who
also
live
by
hunting
which
they
practise
in
the
following
manner
hunter
climbs
up
a
tree
and
lies
in
wait
there
for
his
game
now
trees
are
abundant
in
all
this
country
and
each
has
a
horse
at
hand
which
has
been
taught
to
lie
down
upon
its
belly
in
order
that
it
may
make
itself
low
and
also
a
dog
and
when
he
sees
the
wild
animal
from
the
tree
he
first
shoots
his
arrow
and
then
mounts
upon
his
horse
and
pursues
it
and
the
dog
seizes
hold
of
it
above
these
in
a
direction
towards
the
east
dwell
other
scythians
who
have
revolted
from
the
royal
scythians
and
so
have
come
to
this
region
as
far
as
the
country
of
these
scythians
the
whole
land
which
has
been
described
is
level
plain
and
has
a
deep
soil
but
after
this
point
it
is
stony
and
rugged
then
when
one
has
passed
through
a
great
extent
of
this
rugged
country
there
dwell
in
the
skirts
of
lofty
mountains
men
who
are
said
to
be
all
from
their
birth
male
and
female
equally
and
who
have
flat
noses
and
large
chins
and
speak
a
language
of
their
own
using
the
scythian
manner
of
dress
and
living
on
the
produce
of
trees
the
tree
on
the
fruit
of
which
they
live
is
called
the
pontic
tree
and
it
is
about
the
size
of
a
this
bears
a
fruit
the
size
of
a
bean
containing
a
stone
when
the
fruit
has
ripened
they
strain
it
through
cloths
and
there
flows
from
it
a
thick
black
juice
and
this
juice
which
flows
from
it
is
called
this
they
either
lick
up
or
drink
mixed
with
milk
and
from
its
lees
that
is
the
solid
part
they
make
cakes
and
use
them
for
food
for
they
have
not
many
cattle
since
the
pastures
there
are
by
no
means
good
each
man
has
his
dwelling
under
a
tree
in
winter
covering
the
tree
all
round
with
close
white
and
in
summer
without
it
these
are
injured
by
no
men
for
they
are
said
to
be
sacred
and
they
possess
no
weapon
of
war
these
are
they
also
who
decide
the
disputes
rising
among
their
neighbours
and
besides
this
whatever
fugitive
takes
refuge
with
them
is
injured
by
no
one
and
they
are
called
argippaians
now
as
far
as
these
men
there
is
abundantly
clear
information
about
the
land
and
about
the
nations
on
this
side
of
them
for
not
only
do
certain
of
the
scythians
go
to
them
from
whom
it
is
not
difficult
to
get
information
but
also
some
of
the
hellenes
who
are
at
the
of
the
borysthenes
and
the
other
of
the
pontic
coast
and
those
of
the
scythians
who
go
to
them
transact
their
business
through
seven
interpreters
and
in
seven
different
languages
so
far
as
these
i
say
the
land
is
known
but
concerning
the
region
to
the
north
of
the
men
no
one
can
speak
with
certainty
for
lofty
and
impassable
mountains
divide
it
off
and
no
one
passes
over
them
however
these
men
say
though
i
do
not
believe
it
that
the
mountains
are
inhabited
by
men
with
goats
feet
and
that
after
one
has
passed
beyond
these
others
are
found
who
sleep
through
six
months
of
the
year
this
i
do
not
admit
at
all
as
true
however
the
country
to
the
east
of
the
men
is
known
with
certainty
being
inhabited
by
the
issedonians
but
that
which
lies
beyond
both
the
men
and
the
issedonians
towards
the
north
wind
is
unknown
except
so
far
as
we
know
it
from
the
accounts
given
by
these
nations
which
have
just
been
mentioned
the
issedonians
are
said
to
have
these
customs
a
man
father
is
dead
all
the
relations
bring
cattle
to
the
house
and
then
having
slain
them
and
cut
up
the
flesh
they
cut
up
also
the
dead
body
of
the
father
of
their
entertainer
and
mixing
all
the
flesh
together
they
set
forth
a
banquet
his
skull
however
they
strip
of
the
flesh
and
clean
it
out
and
then
gild
it
over
and
after
that
they
deal
with
it
as
a
sacred
thing
and
perform
for
the
dead
man
great
sacrifices
every
year
this
each
son
does
for
his
father
just
as
the
hellenes
keep
the
day
of
memorial
for
the
dead
in
other
respects
however
this
race
also
is
said
to
live
righteously
and
their
women
have
equal
rights
with
the
men
these
then
also
are
known
but
as
to
the
region
beyond
them
it
is
the
issedonians
who
report
that
there
are
there
men
and
griffins
and
the
scythians
report
this
having
received
it
from
them
and
from
the
scythians
we
that
is
the
rest
of
mankind
have
got
our
belief
and
we
call
them
in
scythian
language
arimaspians
for
the
scythians
call
the
number
one
arima
and
the
eye
spu
this
whole
land
which
has
been
described
is
so
exceedingly
severe
in
climate
that
for
eight
months
of
the
year
there
is
frost
so
hard
as
to
be
intolerable
and
during
these
if
you
pour
out
water
you
will
not
be
able
to
make
mud
but
only
if
you
kindle
a
fire
can
you
make
it
and
the
sea
is
frozen
and
the
whole
of
the
kimmerian
bosphorus
so
that
the
scythians
who
are
settled
within
the
trench
make
expeditions
and
drive
their
waggons
over
into
the
country
of
the
sindians
thus
it
continues
to
be
winter
for
eight
months
and
even
for
the
remaining
four
it
is
cold
in
those
parts
this
winter
is
distinguished
in
its
character
from
all
the
winters
which
come
in
other
parts
of
the
world
for
in
it
there
is
no
rain
to
speak
of
at
the
usual
season
for
rain
whereas
in
summer
it
rains
continually
and
thunder
does
not
come
at
the
time
when
it
comes
in
other
countries
but
is
very
frequent
in
the
summer
and
if
thunder
comes
in
winter
it
is
marvelled
at
as
a
prodigy
just
so
if
an
earthquake
happens
whether
in
summer
or
in
winter
it
is
accounted
a
prodigy
in
scythia
horses
are
able
to
endure
this
winter
but
neither
mules
nor
asses
can
endure
it
at
all
whereas
in
other
countries
horses
if
they
stand
in
frost
lose
their
limbs
by
mortification
while
asses
and
mules
endure
it
i
think
also
that
it
is
for
this
reason
that
the
hornless
breed
of
oxen
in
that
country
have
no
horns
growing
and
there
is
a
verse
of
homer
in
the
odyssey
supporting
my
opinion
which
runs
this
also
the
libyan
land
where
the
sheep
very
quickly
grow
hornèd
for
it
is
rightly
said
that
in
hot
regions
the
horns
come
quickly
whereas
in
extreme
cold
the
animals
either
have
no
horns
growing
at
all
or
hardly
any
in
that
land
then
this
takes
place
on
account
of
the
cold
but
since
my
history
proceeded
from
the
first
seeking
occasions
for
digression
i
feel
wonder
that
in
the
whole
land
of
elis
mules
can
not
be
bred
though
that
region
is
not
cold
nor
is
there
any
other
evident
cause
the
eleians
themselves
say
that
in
consequence
of
some
curse
mules
are
not
begotten
in
their
land
but
when
the
time
approaches
for
the
mares
to
conceive
they
drive
them
out
into
the
neighbouring
lands
and
there
in
the
land
of
their
neighbours
they
admit
to
them
the
until
the
mares
are
pregnant
and
then
they
drive
them
back
as
to
the
feathers
of
which
the
scythians
say
that
the
air
is
full
and
that
by
reason
of
them
they
are
not
able
either
to
see
or
to
pass
through
the
further
parts
of
the
continent
the
opinion
which
i
have
is
this
the
parts
beyond
this
land
it
snows
continually
though
less
in
summer
than
in
winter
as
might
be
supposed
now
whomsoever
has
seen
close
at
hand
snow
falling
thickly
knows
what
i
mean
without
further
explanation
for
the
snow
is
like
feathers
and
on
account
of
this
wintry
weather
being
such
as
i
have
said
the
northern
parts
of
this
continent
are
uninhabitable
i
think
therefore
that
by
the
feathers
the
scythians
and
those
who
dwell
near
them
mean
symbolically
the
snow
this
then
which
has
been
said
goes
to
the
furthest
extent
of
the
accounts
given
about
a
hyperborean
people
the
scythians
report
nothing
nor
do
any
of
those
who
dwell
in
this
region
unless
it
be
the
issedonians
but
in
my
opinion
neither
do
these
report
anything
for
if
they
did
the
scythians
also
would
report
it
as
they
do
about
the
people
hesiod
however
has
spoken
of
hyperboreans
and
so
also
has
homer
in
the
poem
of
the
epigonoi
at
least
if
homer
was
really
the
composer
of
that
epic
but
much
more
about
them
is
reported
by
the
people
of
delos
than
by
any
others
for
these
say
that
sacred
offerings
bound
up
in
wheat
straw
are
carried
from
the
land
of
the
hyperboreans
and
come
to
the
scythians
and
then
from
the
scythians
the
neighbouring
nations
in
succession
receive
them
and
convey
them
westwards
finally
as
far
as
the
adriatic
thence
they
are
sent
forward
towards
the
south
and
the
people
of
dodona
receive
them
first
of
all
the
hellenes
and
from
these
they
come
down
to
the
malian
gulf
and
are
passed
over
to
euboea
where
city
sends
them
on
to
city
till
they
come
to
carystos
after
this
andros
is
left
out
for
the
carystians
are
those
who
bring
them
to
tenos
and
the
tenians
to
delos
thus
they
say
that
these
sacred
offerings
come
to
delos
but
at
first
they
say
the
hyperboreans
sent
two
maidens
bearing
the
sacred
offerings
whose
names
say
the
delians
were
hyperoche
and
laodike
and
with
them
for
their
protection
the
hyperboreans
sent
five
men
of
their
nation
to
attend
them
those
namely
who
are
now
called
perphereës
and
have
great
honours
paid
to
them
in
delos
since
however
the
hyperboreans
found
that
those
who
were
sent
away
did
not
return
back
they
were
troubled
to
think
that
it
would
always
befall
them
to
send
out
and
not
to
receive
back
and
so
they
bore
the
offerings
to
the
borders
of
their
land
bound
up
in
wheat
straw
and
laid
a
charge
upon
their
neighbours
bidding
them
send
these
forward
from
themselves
to
another
nation
these
things
then
they
say
come
to
delos
being
thus
sent
forward
and
i
know
of
my
own
knowledge
that
a
thing
is
done
which
has
resemblance
to
these
offerings
namely
that
the
women
of
thrace
and
paionia
when
they
sacrifice
to
artemis
the
queen
do
not
make
their
offerings
without
wheat
straw
these
i
know
do
as
i
have
said
and
for
those
maidens
from
the
hyperboreans
who
died
in
delos
both
the
girls
and
the
boys
of
the
delians
cut
off
their
hair
the
former
before
marriage
cut
off
a
lock
and
having
wound
it
round
a
spindle
lay
it
upon
the
tomb
now
the
tomb
is
on
the
left
hand
as
one
goes
into
the
temple
of
artemis
and
over
it
grows
an
and
all
the
boys
of
the
delians
wind
some
of
their
hair
about
a
green
shoot
of
some
tree
and
they
also
place
it
upon
the
tomb
the
maidens
i
say
have
this
honour
paid
them
by
the
dwellers
in
delos
and
the
same
people
say
that
arge
and
opis
also
being
maidens
came
to
delos
passing
from
the
hyperboreans
by
the
same
nations
which
have
been
mentioned
even
before
hyperoche
and
laodike
these
last
they
say
came
bearing
for
eileithuia
the
tribute
which
they
had
laid
upon
themselves
for
the
speedy
birth
but
arge
and
opis
came
with
the
divinities
themselves
and
other
honours
have
been
assigned
to
them
by
the
people
of
delos
for
the
women
they
say
collect
for
them
naming
them
by
their
names
in
the
hymn
which
olen
a
man
of
lykia
composed
in
their
honour
and
both
the
natives
of
the
other
islands
and
the
ionians
have
learnt
from
them
to
sing
hymns
naming
opis
and
arge
and
collecting
this
olen
came
from
lukia
and
composed
also
the
other
ancient
hymns
which
are
sung
in
delos
moreover
they
say
that
when
the
thighs
of
the
victim
are
consumed
upon
the
altar
the
ashes
of
them
are
used
to
cast
upon
the
grave
of
opis
and
arge
now
their
grave
is
behind
the
temple
of
artemis
turned
towards
the
east
close
to
the
banqueting
hall
of
the
keïeans
let
this
suffice
which
has
been
said
of
the
hyperboreans
for
the
tale
of
abaris
who
is
reported
to
have
been
a
hyperborean
i
do
not
tell
namely
how
he
carried
the
arrow
about
all
over
the
earth
eating
no
food
if
however
there
are
any
hyperboreans
it
follows
that
there
are
also
hypernotians
and
i
laugh
when
i
see
that
though
many
before
this
have
drawn
maps
of
the
earth
yet
no
one
has
set
the
matter
forth
in
an
intelligent
way
seeing
that
they
draw
ocean
flowing
round
the
earth
which
is
circular
exactly
as
if
drawn
with
compasses
and
they
make
asia
equal
in
size
to
europe
in
a
few
words
i
shall
declare
the
size
of
each
division
and
of
what
nature
it
is
as
regards
outline
the
persians
inhabit
asia
extending
to
the
southern
sea
which
is
called
the
erythraian
and
above
these
towards
the
north
wind
dwell
the
medes
and
above
the
medes
the
saspeirians
and
above
the
saspeirians
the
colchians
extending
to
the
northern
sea
into
which
the
river
phasis
runs
these
four
nations
inhabit
from
sea
to
sea
from
them
westwards
two
peninsulas
stretch
out
from
asia
into
the
sea
and
these
i
will
describe
the
first
peninsula
on
the
one
of
its
sides
that
is
the
northern
stretches
along
beginning
from
the
phasis
and
extending
to
the
sea
going
along
the
pontus
and
the
hellespont
as
far
as
sigeion
in
the
land
of
troy
and
on
the
southern
side
the
same
peninsula
stretches
from
the
myriandrian
gulf
which
lies
near
phenicia
in
the
direction
of
the
sea
as
far
as
the
headland
triopion
and
in
this
peninsula
dwell
thirty
races
of
men
this
then
is
one
of
the
peninsulas
and
the
other
beginning
from
the
land
of
the
persians
stretches
along
to
the
erythraian
sea
including
persia
and
next
after
it
assyria
and
arabia
after
assyria
and
this
ends
or
rather
is
commonly
supposed
to
end
at
the
arabian
gulf
into
which
dareios
conducted
a
channel
from
the
nile
now
in
the
line
stretching
to
phenicia
from
the
land
of
the
persians
the
land
is
broad
and
the
space
abundant
but
after
phenicia
this
peninsula
goes
by
the
shore
of
our
sea
along
palestine
syria
and
egypt
where
it
ends
and
in
it
there
are
three
nations
only
these
are
the
parts
of
asia
which
tend
towards
the
west
from
the
persian
land
but
as
to
those
which
lie
beyond
the
persians
and
medes
and
saspeirians
and
colchians
towards
the
east
and
the
sunrising
on
one
side
the
erythraian
sea
runs
along
by
them
and
on
the
north
both
the
caspian
sea
and
the
river
araxes
which
flows
towards
the
rising
sun
and
asia
is
inhabited
as
far
as
the
indian
land
but
from
this
onwards
towards
the
east
it
becomes
desert
nor
can
any
one
say
what
manner
of
land
it
is
such
and
so
large
is
asia
and
libya
is
included
in
the
second
peninsula
for
after
egypt
libya
succeeds
at
once
now
about
egypt
this
peninsula
is
narrow
for
from
our
sea
to
the
erythraian
sea
is
a
distance
there
of
ten
myriads
of
fathoms
which
would
amount
to
a
thousand
furlongs
but
after
this
narrow
part
the
portion
of
the
peninsula
which
is
called
libya
is
as
it
chances
extremely
broad
i
wonder
then
at
those
who
have
parted
off
and
divided
the
world
into
libya
asia
and
europe
since
the
difference
between
these
is
not
small
for
in
length
europe
extends
along
by
both
while
in
breadth
it
is
clear
to
me
that
it
is
beyond
comparison
larger
for
libya
furnishes
proofs
about
itself
that
it
is
surrounded
by
sea
except
so
much
of
it
as
borders
upon
asia
and
this
fact
was
shown
by
necos
king
of
the
egyptians
first
of
all
those
about
whom
we
have
knowledge
he
when
he
had
ceased
digging
the
channel
which
goes
through
from
the
nile
to
the
arabian
gulf
sent
phenicians
with
ships
bidding
them
sail
and
come
back
through
the
pillars
of
heracles
to
the
northern
sea
and
so
to
egypt
the
phenicians
therefore
set
forth
from
the
erythraian
sea
and
sailed
through
the
southern
sea
and
when
autumn
came
they
would
put
to
shore
and
sow
the
land
wherever
in
libya
they
might
happen
to
be
as
they
sailed
and
then
they
waited
for
the
harvest
and
having
reaped
the
corn
they
would
sail
on
so
that
after
two
years
had
elapsed
in
the
third
year
they
turned
through
the
pillars
of
heracles
and
arrived
again
in
egypt
and
they
reported
a
thing
which
i
can
not
believe
but
another
man
may
namely
that
in
sailing
round
libya
they
had
the
sun
on
their
right
hand
thus
was
this
country
first
known
to
be
what
it
is
and
after
this
it
is
the
carthaginians
who
make
report
of
it
for
as
to
sataspes
the
son
of
teaspis
the
achaimenid
he
did
not
sail
round
libya
though
he
was
sent
for
this
very
purpose
but
was
struck
with
fear
by
the
length
of
the
voyage
and
the
desolate
nature
of
the
land
and
so
returned
back
and
did
not
accomplish
the
task
which
his
mother
laid
upon
him
for
this
man
had
outraged
a
daughter
of
zopyros
the
son
of
megabyzos
a
virgin
and
then
when
he
was
about
to
be
impaled
by
order
of
king
xerxes
for
this
offence
the
mother
of
sataspes
who
was
a
sister
of
dareios
entreated
for
his
life
saying
that
she
would
herself
lay
upon
him
a
greater
penalty
than
xerxes
for
he
should
be
compelled
she
said
to
sail
round
libya
until
in
sailing
round
it
he
came
to
the
arabian
gulf
so
then
xerxes
having
agreed
upon
these
terms
sataspes
went
to
egypt
and
obtaining
a
ship
and
sailors
from
the
egyptians
he
sailed
to
the
pillars
of
heracles
and
having
sailed
through
them
and
turned
the
point
of
libya
which
is
called
the
promontory
of
soloeis
he
sailed
on
towards
the
south
then
after
he
had
passed
over
much
sea
in
many
months
as
there
was
needed
ever
more
and
more
voyaging
he
turned
about
and
sailed
back
again
to
egypt
and
having
come
from
thence
into
the
presence
of
king
xerxes
he
reported
saying
that
at
the
furthest
point
which
he
reached
he
was
sailing
by
dwarfish
people
who
used
clothing
made
from
the
and
who
whenever
they
came
to
land
with
their
ship
left
their
towns
and
fled
away
to
the
mountains
and
they
he
said
did
no
injury
when
they
entered
into
the
towns
but
took
food
from
them
only
and
the
cause
he
said
why
he
had
not
completely
sailed
round
libya
was
that
the
ship
could
not
advance
any
further
but
stuck
fast
xerxes
however
did
not
believe
that
he
was
speaking
the
truth
and
since
he
had
not
performed
the
appointed
task
he
impaled
him
inflicting
upon
him
the
penalty
pronounced
before
a
eunuch
belonging
to
this
sataspes
ran
away
to
samos
as
soon
as
he
heard
that
his
master
was
dead
carrying
with
him
large
sums
of
money
and
of
this
a
man
of
samos
took
possession
whose
name
i
know
but
i
purposely
pass
it
over
without
mention
of
asia
the
greater
part
was
explored
by
dareios
who
desiring
to
know
of
the
river
indus
which
is
a
second
river
producing
crocodiles
of
all
the
rivers
in
the
world
know
i
say
of
this
river
where
it
runs
out
into
the
sea
sent
with
ships
besides
others
whom
he
trusted
to
speak
the
truth
skylax
also
a
man
of
caryanda
these
starting
from
the
city
of
caspatyros
and
the
land
of
pactyïke
sailed
down
the
river
towards
the
east
and
the
sunrising
to
the
sea
and
then
sailing
over
the
sea
westwards
they
came
in
the
thirtieth
month
to
that
place
from
whence
the
king
of
the
egyptians
had
sent
out
the
phenicians
of
whom
i
spoke
before
to
sail
round
libya
after
these
had
made
their
voyage
round
the
coast
dareios
both
subdued
the
indians
and
made
use
of
this
sea
thus
asia
also
excepting
the
parts
of
it
which
are
towards
the
rising
sun
has
been
found
to
be
similar
to
libya
as
to
europe
however
it
is
clearly
not
known
by
any
either
as
regards
the
parts
which
are
towards
the
rising
sun
or
those
towards
the
north
whether
it
be
surrounded
by
sea
but
in
length
it
is
known
to
stretch
along
by
both
the
other
divisions
and
i
am
not
able
to
understand
for
what
reason
it
is
that
to
the
earth
which
is
one
three
different
names
are
given
derived
from
women
and
why
there
were
set
as
boundaries
to
divide
it
the
river
nile
of
egypt
and
the
phasis
in
colchis
or
as
some
say
the
maiotian
river
tanaïs
and
the
kimmerian
ferry
nor
can
i
learn
who
those
persons
were
who
made
the
boundaries
or
for
what
reason
they
gave
the
names
libya
indeed
is
said
by
most
of
the
hellenes
to
have
its
name
from
libya
a
woman
of
that
country
and
asia
from
the
wife
of
prometheus
but
this
last
name
is
claimed
by
the
lydians
who
say
that
asia
has
been
called
after
asias
the
son
of
cotys
the
son
of
manes
and
not
from
asia
the
wife
of
prometheus
and
from
him
too
they
say
the
asian
tribe
in
sardis
has
its
name
as
to
europe
however
it
is
neither
known
by
any
man
whether
it
is
surrounded
by
sea
nor
does
it
appear
whence
it
got
this
name
or
who
he
was
who
gave
it
unless
we
shall
say
that
the
land
received
its
name
from
europa
the
tyrian
and
if
so
it
would
appear
that
before
this
it
was
nameless
like
the
rest
she
however
evidently
belongs
to
asia
and
did
not
come
to
this
land
which
is
now
called
by
the
hellenes
europe
but
only
from
phenicia
to
crete
and
from
crete
to
lykia
let
this
suffice
now
which
has
been
said
about
these
matters
for
we
will
adopt
those
which
are
commonly
accepted
of
the
accounts
now
the
region
of
the
euxine
upon
which
dareios
was
preparing
to
march
has
apart
from
the
scythian
race
the
most
ignorant
nations
within
it
of
all
lands
for
we
can
neither
put
forward
any
nation
of
those
who
dwell
within
the
region
of
pontus
as
eminent
in
ability
nor
do
we
know
of
any
man
of
learning
having
arisen
there
apart
from
the
scythian
nation
and
anacharsis
by
the
scythian
race
one
thing
which
is
the
most
important
of
all
human
things
has
been
found
out
more
cleverly
than
by
any
other
men
of
whom
we
know
but
in
other
respects
i
have
no
great
admiration
for
them
and
that
most
important
thing
which
they
have
discovered
is
such
that
none
can
escape
again
who
has
come
to
attack
them
and
if
they
do
not
desire
to
be
found
it
is
not
possible
to
catch
them
for
they
who
have
neither
cities
founded
nor
walls
built
but
all
carry
their
houses
with
them
and
are
mounted
archers
living
not
by
the
plough
but
by
cattle
and
whose
dwellings
are
upon
cars
these
assuredly
are
invincible
and
impossible
to
approach
this
they
have
found
out
seeing
that
their
land
is
suitable
to
it
and
at
the
same
time
the
rivers
are
their
allies
for
first
this
land
is
plain
land
and
is
grassy
and
well
watered
and
then
there
are
rivers
flowing
through
it
not
much
less
in
number
than
the
channels
in
egypt
of
these
as
many
as
are
noteworthy
and
also
can
be
navigated
from
the
sea
i
will
name
there
is
ister
with
five
mouths
and
after
this
tyras
hypanis
borysthenes
panticapes
kypakyris
gerros
and
tanaïs
these
flow
as
i
shall
now
describe
the
ister
which
is
the
greatest
of
all
the
rivers
which
we
know
flows
always
with
equal
volume
in
summer
and
winter
alike
it
is
the
first
towards
the
west
of
all
the
scythian
rivers
and
it
has
become
the
greatest
of
all
rivers
because
other
rivers
flow
into
it
and
these
are
they
which
make
it
great
in
number
are
those
which
flow
through
the
scythian
land
namely
that
which
the
scythians
call
porata
and
the
hellenes
pyretos
and
besides
this
tiarantos
and
araros
and
naparis
and
ordessos
the
of
these
is
a
great
river
lying
towards
the
east
and
there
it
joins
waters
with
the
ister
the
second
tiarantos
is
more
to
the
west
and
smaller
and
the
araros
and
naparis
and
ordessos
flow
into
the
ister
going
between
these
two
these
are
the
native
scythian
rivers
which
join
to
swell
its
stream
while
from
the
agathyrsians
flows
the
maris
and
joins
the
ister
and
from
the
summits
of
haimos
flow
three
other
great
rivers
towards
the
north
wind
and
fall
into
it
namely
atlas
and
auras
and
tibisis
through
thrace
and
the
thracian
crobyzians
flow
the
rivers
athrys
and
noes
and
artanes
running
into
the
ister
and
from
the
paionians
and
mount
rhodope
the
river
kios
cutting
through
haimos
in
the
midst
runs
into
it
also
from
the
illyrians
the
river
angros
flows
northwards
and
runs
out
into
the
triballian
plain
and
into
the
river
brongos
and
the
brongos
flows
into
the
ister
thus
the
ister
receives
both
these
being
great
rivers
from
the
region
which
is
above
the
ombricans
the
river
carpis
and
another
river
the
alpis
flow
also
towards
the
north
wind
and
run
into
it
for
the
ister
flows
in
fact
through
the
whole
of
europe
beginning
in
the
land
of
the
keltoi
who
after
the
kynesians
dwell
furthest
towards
the
of
all
the
peoples
of
europe
and
thus
flowing
through
all
europe
it
falls
into
the
sea
by
the
side
of
scythia
so
then
it
is
because
these
which
have
been
named
and
many
others
join
their
waters
together
that
ister
becomes
the
greatest
of
rivers
since
if
we
compare
the
single
streams
the
nile
is
superior
in
volume
of
water
for
into
this
no
river
or
spring
flows
to
contribute
to
its
volume
and
the
ister
flows
at
an
equal
level
always
both
in
summer
and
in
winter
for
some
such
cause
as
this
as
i
suppose
winter
it
is
of
the
natural
size
or
becomes
only
a
little
larger
than
its
nature
seeing
that
this
land
receives
very
little
rain
in
winter
but
constantly
has
snow
whereas
in
summer
the
snow
which
fell
in
the
winter
in
quantity
abundant
melts
and
runs
from
all
parts
into
the
ister
this
snow
of
which
i
speak
running
into
the
river
helps
to
swell
its
volume
and
with
it
also
many
and
violent
showers
of
rain
for
it
rains
during
the
summer
and
thus
the
waters
which
mingle
with
the
ister
are
more
copious
in
summer
than
they
are
in
winter
by
about
as
much
as
the
water
which
the
sun
draws
to
himself
in
summer
exceeds
that
which
he
draws
in
winter
and
by
the
setting
of
these
things
against
one
another
there
is
produced
a
balance
so
that
the
river
is
seen
to
be
of
equal
volume
always
one
i
say
of
the
rivers
which
the
scythians
have
is
the
ister
and
after
it
the
tyras
which
starts
from
the
north
and
begins
its
course
from
a
large
lake
which
is
the
boundary
between
the
land
of
the
scythians
and
that
of
the
neuroi
at
its
mouth
are
settled
those
hellenes
who
are
called
tyritai
the
third
river
is
the
hypanis
which
starts
from
scythia
and
flows
from
a
great
lake
round
which
feed
white
wild
horses
and
this
lake
is
rightly
called
mother
of
hypanis
from
this
then
the
river
hypanis
takes
its
rise
and
for
a
distance
of
five
days
sail
it
flows
shallow
and
with
sweet
water
still
but
from
this
point
on
towards
the
sea
for
four
days
sail
it
is
very
bitter
for
there
flows
into
it
the
water
of
a
bitter
spring
which
is
so
exceedingly
bitter
that
small
as
it
is
it
changes
the
water
of
the
hypanis
by
mingling
with
it
though
that
is
a
river
to
which
few
are
equal
in
greatness
this
spring
is
on
the
border
between
the
lands
of
the
agricultural
scythians
and
of
the
alazonians
and
the
name
of
the
spring
and
of
the
place
from
which
it
flows
is
in
scythian
exampaios
and
in
the
hellenic
tongue
hierai
hodoi
now
the
tyras
and
the
hypanis
approach
one
another
in
their
windings
in
the
land
of
the
alazonians
but
after
this
each
turns
off
and
widens
the
space
between
them
as
they
flow
fourth
is
the
river
borysthenes
which
is
both
the
largest
of
these
after
the
ister
and
also
in
our
opinion
the
most
serviceable
not
only
of
the
scythian
rivers
but
also
of
all
the
rivers
of
the
world
besides
excepting
only
the
nile
of
egypt
for
to
this
it
is
not
possible
to
compare
any
other
river
of
the
rest
however
the
borysthenes
is
the
most
serviceable
seeing
that
it
provides
both
pastures
which
are
the
fairest
and
the
richest
for
cattle
and
fish
which
are
better
by
far
and
more
numerous
than
those
of
any
other
river
and
also
it
is
the
sweetest
water
to
drink
and
flows
with
clear
stream
though
others
beside
it
are
turbid
and
along
its
banks
crops
are
produced
better
than
elsewhere
while
in
parts
where
it
is
not
sown
grass
grows
deeper
moreover
at
its
mouth
salt
forms
of
itself
in
abundance
and
it
produces
also
huge
fish
without
spines
which
they
call
antacaioi
to
be
used
for
salting
and
many
other
things
also
worthy
of
wonder
now
as
far
as
the
region
of
the
gerrians
to
which
it
is
a
voyage
of
forty
days
the
borysthenes
is
known
as
flowing
from
the
north
wind
but
above
this
none
can
tell
through
what
nations
it
flows
it
is
certain
however
that
it
runs
through
desert
to
the
land
of
the
agricultural
scythians
for
these
scythians
dwell
along
its
banks
for
a
distance
of
ten
days
sail
of
this
river
alone
and
of
the
nile
i
can
not
tell
where
the
sources
are
nor
i
think
can
any
of
the
hellenes
when
the
borysthenes
comes
near
the
sea
in
its
course
the
hypanis
mingles
with
it
running
out
into
the
same
marsh
and
the
space
between
these
two
rivers
which
is
as
it
were
a
beak
of
land
is
called
the
point
of
hippoles
and
in
it
is
placed
a
temple
of
the
mother
and
opposite
the
temple
upon
the
river
hypanis
are
settled
the
borysthenites
this
is
that
which
has
to
do
with
these
rivers
and
after
these
there
is
a
fifth
river
besides
called
panticapes
this
also
flows
both
from
the
north
and
from
a
lake
and
in
the
space
between
this
river
and
the
borysthenes
dwell
the
agricultural
scythians
it
runs
out
into
the
region
of
hylaia
and
having
passed
by
this
it
mingles
with
the
borysthenes
sixth
comes
the
river
hypakyris
which
starts
from
a
lake
and
flowing
through
the
midst
of
the
nomad
scythians
runs
out
into
the
sea
by
the
city
of
carkinitis
skirting
on
its
right
bank
the
region
of
hylaia
and
the
racecourse
of
achilles
seventh
is
the
gerros
which
parts
off
from
the
borysthenes
near
about
that
part
of
the
country
where
the
borysthenes
ceases
to
be
known
parts
off
i
say
in
this
region
and
has
the
same
name
which
this
region
itself
has
namely
gerros
and
as
it
flows
to
the
sea
it
borders
the
country
of
the
nomad
and
that
of
the
royal
scythians
and
runs
out
into
the
hypakyris
the
eighth
is
the
river
tanaïs
which
starts
in
its
flow
at
first
from
a
large
lake
and
runs
out
into
a
still
larger
lake
called
maiotis
which
is
the
boundary
between
the
royal
scythians
and
the
sauromatai
into
this
tanaïs
falls
another
river
whose
name
is
hyrgis
so
many
are
the
rivers
of
note
with
which
the
scythians
are
provided
and
for
cattle
the
grass
which
comes
up
in
the
land
of
scythia
is
the
most
productive
of
bile
of
any
grass
which
we
know
and
that
this
is
so
you
may
judge
when
you
open
the
bodies
of
the
cattle
thus
abundant
supply
have
they
of
that
which
is
most
important
and
as
for
the
rest
their
customs
are
as
follows
the
gods
whom
they
propitiate
by
worship
are
these
only
most
of
all
then
zeus
and
the
earth
supposing
that
earth
is
the
wife
of
zeus
and
after
these
apollo
and
aphrodite
urania
and
heracles
and
ares
of
these
all
the
scythians
have
the
worship
established
and
the
royal
scythians
sacrifice
also
to
poseidon
now
hestia
is
called
in
scythian
tabiti
and
zeus
being
most
rightly
named
in
my
opinion
is
called
papaios
and
earth
api
and
apollo
oitosyros
and
aphrodite
urania
is
called
argimpasa
and
poseidon
thagimasidas
it
is
not
their
custom
however
to
make
images
altars
or
temples
to
any
except
ares
but
to
him
it
is
their
custom
to
make
them
they
have
all
the
same
manner
of
sacrifice
established
for
all
their
religious
rites
equally
and
it
is
thus
performed
victim
stands
with
its
tied
and
the
sacrificing
priest
stands
behind
the
victim
and
by
pulling
the
end
of
the
cord
he
throws
the
beast
down
and
as
the
victim
falls
he
calls
upon
the
god
to
whom
he
is
sacrificing
and
then
at
once
throws
a
noose
round
its
neck
and
putting
a
small
stick
into
it
he
turns
it
round
and
so
strangles
the
animal
without
either
lighting
a
fire
or
making
any
first
offering
from
the
victim
or
pouring
any
libation
over
it
and
when
he
has
strangled
it
and
flayed
off
the
skin
he
proceeds
to
boil
it
now
as
the
land
of
scythia
is
exceedingly
ill
wooded
this
contrivance
has
been
invented
for
the
boiling
of
the
flesh
flayed
the
victims
they
strip
the
flesh
off
the
bones
and
then
put
it
into
caldrons
if
they
happen
to
have
any
of
native
make
which
very
much
resemble
lesbian
except
that
they
are
much
larger
these
they
put
the
flesh
and
boil
it
by
lighting
under
it
the
bones
of
the
victim
if
however
thy
have
not
at
hand
the
caldron
they
put
all
the
flesh
into
the
stomachs
of
the
victims
and
adding
water
they
light
the
bones
under
them
and
these
blaze
up
beautifully
and
the
stomachs
easily
hold
the
flesh
when
it
has
been
stripped
off
the
bones
thus
an
ox
is
made
to
boil
itself
and
the
other
kinds
of
victims
each
boil
themselves
also
then
when
the
flesh
is
boiled
the
sacrificer
takes
a
first
offering
of
the
flesh
and
of
the
vital
organs
and
casts
it
in
front
of
him
and
they
sacrifice
various
kinds
of
cattle
but
especially
horses
to
the
others
of
the
gods
they
sacrifice
thus
and
these
kinds
of
beasts
but
to
ares
as
follows
each
district
of
the
several
governments
they
have
a
temple
of
ares
set
up
in
this
way
of
brushwood
are
heaped
up
for
about
three
furlongs
in
length
and
in
breadth
but
less
in
height
and
on
the
top
of
this
there
is
a
level
square
made
and
three
of
the
sides
rise
sheer
but
by
the
remaining
one
side
the
pile
may
be
ascended
every
year
they
pile
on
a
hundred
and
fifty
of
brushwood
for
it
is
constantly
settling
down
by
reason
of
the
weather
upon
this
pile
of
which
i
speak
each
people
has
an
ancient
iron
sword
set
up
and
this
is
the
sacred
symbol
of
ares
to
this
sword
they
bring
yearly
offerings
of
cattle
and
of
horses
and
they
have
the
following
sacrifice
in
addition
beyond
what
they
make
to
the
other
gods
that
is
to
say
of
all
the
enemies
whom
they
take
captive
in
war
they
sacrifice
one
man
in
every
hundred
not
in
the
same
manner
as
they
sacrifice
cattle
but
in
a
different
manner
for
they
first
pour
wine
over
their
heads
and
after
that
they
cut
the
throats
of
the
men
so
that
the
blood
runs
into
a
bowl
and
then
they
carry
this
up
to
the
top
of
the
pile
of
brushwood
and
pour
the
blood
over
the
sword
this
i
say
they
carry
up
and
meanwhile
below
by
the
side
of
the
temple
they
are
doing
thus
cut
off
all
the
right
arms
of
the
slaughtered
men
with
the
hands
and
throw
them
up
into
the
air
and
then
when
they
have
finished
offering
the
other
victims
they
go
away
and
the
arm
lies
wheresoever
it
has
chanced
to
fall
and
the
corpse
apart
from
it
such
are
the
sacrifices
which
are
established
among
them
but
of
swine
these
make
no
use
nor
indeed
are
they
wont
to
keep
them
at
all
in
their
land
that
which
relates
to
war
is
thus
ordered
with
them
a
scythian
has
slain
his
first
man
he
drinks
some
of
his
blood
and
of
all
those
whom
he
slays
in
the
battle
he
bears
the
heads
to
the
king
for
if
he
has
brought
a
head
he
shares
in
the
spoil
which
they
have
taken
but
otherwise
not
and
he
takes
off
the
skin
of
the
head
by
cutting
it
round
about
the
ears
and
then
taking
hold
of
the
scalp
and
shaking
it
off
afterwards
he
scrapes
off
the
flesh
with
the
rib
of
an
ox
and
works
the
skin
about
with
his
hands
and
when
he
has
thus
tempered
it
he
keeps
it
as
a
napkin
to
wipe
the
hands
upon
and
hangs
it
from
the
bridle
of
the
horse
on
which
he
himself
rides
and
takes
pride
in
it
for
whosoever
has
the
greatest
number
of
skins
to
wipe
the
hands
upon
he
is
judged
to
be
the
bravest
man
many
also
make
cloaks
to
wear
of
the
skins
stripped
off
sewing
them
together
like
shepherds
cloaks
of
skins
and
many
take
the
skin
together
with
the
off
the
right
hands
of
their
enemies
when
they
are
dead
and
make
them
into
covers
for
their
quivers
now
human
skin
it
seems
is
both
thick
and
glossy
in
appearance
more
brilliantly
white
than
any
other
skin
many
also
take
the
skins
off
the
whole
bodies
of
men
and
stretch
them
on
pieces
of
wood
and
carry
them
about
on
their
horses
such
are
their
established
customs
about
these
things
and
to
the
skulls
themselves
not
of
all
but
of
their
greatest
enemies
they
do
thus
man
saws
off
all
below
the
eyebrows
and
clears
out
the
inside
and
if
he
is
a
poor
man
he
only
stretches
round
it
and
then
makes
use
of
it
but
if
he
be
rich
besides
stretching
the
he
gilds
it
over
within
and
makes
use
of
it
as
a
they
do
this
also
if
any
of
their
own
family
have
been
at
variance
with
them
and
the
man
gets
the
better
of
his
adversary
in
trial
before
the
king
and
when
strangers
come
to
him
whom
he
highly
esteems
he
sets
these
skulls
before
them
and
adds
the
comment
that
they
being
of
his
own
family
had
made
war
against
him
and
that
he
had
got
the
better
of
them
and
this
they
hold
to
be
a
proof
of
manly
virtue
once
every
year
each
ruler
of
a
district
mixes
in
his
own
district
a
bowl
of
wine
from
which
those
of
the
scythians
drink
by
whom
enemies
have
been
slain
but
those
by
whom
this
has
not
been
done
do
not
taste
of
the
wine
but
sit
apart
dishonoured
and
this
is
the
greatest
of
all
disgraces
among
them
but
those
of
them
who
have
slain
a
very
great
number
of
men
drink
with
two
cups
together
at
the
same
time
diviners
there
are
many
among
the
scythians
and
they
divine
with
a
number
of
willow
rods
in
the
following
manner
bring
large
bundles
of
rods
and
having
laid
them
on
the
ground
they
unroll
them
and
setting
each
rod
by
itself
apart
they
prophesy
and
while
speaking
thus
they
roll
the
rods
together
again
and
after
that
they
place
them
in
order
a
second
time
one
by
one
this
manner
of
divination
they
have
from
their
fathers
but
the
enareës
or
say
that
aphrodite
gave
them
the
gift
of
divination
and
they
divine
accordingly
with
the
bark
of
the
having
divided
the
into
three
strips
the
man
twists
them
together
in
his
fingers
and
untwists
them
again
and
as
he
does
this
he
utters
the
oracle
when
the
king
of
the
scythians
is
sick
he
sends
for
three
of
the
diviners
namely
those
who
are
most
in
repute
who
divine
in
the
manner
which
has
been
said
and
these
say
for
the
most
part
something
like
this
namely
that
so
and
so
has
sworn
falsely
by
the
hearth
of
the
king
and
they
name
one
of
the
citizens
whosoever
it
may
happen
to
be
now
it
is
the
prevailing
custom
of
the
scythians
to
swear
by
the
hearth
of
the
king
at
the
times
when
they
desire
to
swear
the
most
solemn
oath
he
then
who
they
say
has
sworn
falsely
is
brought
forthwith
held
fast
on
both
sides
and
when
he
has
come
the
diviners
charge
him
with
this
that
he
is
shown
by
their
divination
to
have
sworn
falsely
by
the
hearth
of
the
king
and
that
for
this
reason
the
king
is
suffering
pain
and
he
denies
and
says
that
he
did
not
swear
falsely
and
complains
indignantly
and
when
he
denies
it
the
king
sends
for
other
diviners
twice
as
many
in
number
and
if
these
also
by
looking
into
their
divination
pronounce
him
guilty
of
having
sworn
falsely
at
once
they
cut
off
the
man
head
and
the
diviners
who
came
first
part
his
goods
among
them
by
lot
but
if
the
diviners
who
came
in
afterwards
acquit
him
other
diviners
come
in
and
again
others
after
them
if
then
the
greater
number
acquit
the
man
the
sentence
is
that
the
first
diviners
shall
themselves
be
put
to
death
they
put
them
to
death
accordingly
in
the
following
manner
they
fill
a
waggon
with
brushwood
and
yoke
oxen
to
it
then
having
bound
the
feet
of
the
diviners
and
tied
their
hands
behind
them
and
stopped
their
mouths
with
gags
they
fasten
them
down
in
the
middle
of
the
brushwood
and
having
set
fire
to
it
they
scare
the
oxen
and
let
them
go
and
often
the
oxen
are
burnt
to
death
together
with
the
diviners
and
often
they
escape
after
being
scorched
when
the
pole
to
which
they
are
fastened
has
been
burnt
and
they
burn
the
diviners
in
the
manner
described
for
other
causes
also
calling
them
false
prophets
now
when
the
king
puts
any
to
death
he
does
not
leave
alive
their
sons
either
but
he
puts
to
death
all
the
males
not
doing
any
hurt
to
the
females
in
the
following
manner
the
scythians
make
oaths
to
whomsoever
they
make
them
pour
wine
into
a
great
earthenware
cup
and
mingle
with
it
blood
of
those
who
are
taking
the
oath
to
one
another
either
making
a
prick
with
an
awl
or
cutting
with
a
dagger
a
little
way
into
their
body
and
then
they
dip
into
the
cup
a
sword
and
arrows
and
a
and
a
javelin
and
having
done
this
they
invoke
many
curses
on
the
breaker
of
the
oath
and
afterwards
they
drink
it
off
both
they
who
are
making
the
oath
and
the
most
honourable
of
their
company
the
of
the
kings
is
in
the
land
of
the
gerrians
the
place
up
to
which
the
borysthenes
is
navigable
in
this
place
when
their
king
has
died
they
make
a
large
square
excavation
in
the
earth
and
when
they
have
made
this
ready
they
take
up
the
corpse
the
body
being
covered
over
with
wax
and
the
belly
ripped
up
and
cleansed
and
then
sewn
together
again
after
it
has
been
filled
with
kyperos
cut
up
and
spices
and
and
anise
and
they
convey
it
in
a
waggon
to
another
nation
then
those
who
receive
the
corpse
thus
conveyed
to
them
do
the
same
as
the
royal
scythians
that
is
they
cut
off
a
part
of
their
ear
and
shave
their
hair
round
about
and
cut
themselves
all
over
the
arms
and
tear
their
forehead
and
nose
and
pass
arrows
through
their
left
hand
thence
they
convey
in
the
waggon
the
corpse
of
the
king
to
another
of
the
nations
over
whom
they
rule
and
they
to
whom
they
came
before
accompany
them
and
when
they
have
gone
round
to
all
conveying
the
corpse
then
they
are
in
the
land
of
the
gerrians
who
have
their
settlements
furthest
away
of
all
the
nations
over
whom
they
rule
and
they
have
reached
the
spot
where
the
burial
place
is
after
that
having
placed
the
corpse
in
the
tomb
upon
a
bed
of
leaves
they
stick
spears
along
on
this
side
and
that
of
the
corpse
and
stretch
pieces
of
wood
over
them
and
then
they
cover
the
place
in
with
matting
then
they
strangle
and
bury
in
the
remaining
space
of
the
tomb
one
of
the
king
mistresses
his
his
cook
his
his
attendant
and
his
bearer
of
messages
and
also
horses
and
a
first
portion
of
all
things
else
and
cups
of
gold
for
silver
they
do
not
use
at
all
nor
yet
bronze
having
thus
done
they
all
join
together
to
pile
up
a
great
mound
vying
with
one
another
and
zealously
endeavouring
to
make
it
as
large
as
possible
afterwards
when
the
year
comes
round
again
they
do
as
follows
take
the
most
capable
of
the
remaining
servants
these
are
native
scythians
for
those
serve
him
whom
the
king
himself
commands
to
do
so
and
his
servants
are
not
bought
for
money
these
attendants
then
they
strangle
fifty
and
also
fifty
of
the
finest
horses
and
when
they
have
taken
out
their
bowels
and
cleansed
the
belly
they
fill
it
with
chaff
and
sew
it
together
again
then
they
set
the
half
of
a
wheel
upon
two
stakes
with
the
hollow
side
upwards
and
the
other
half
of
the
wheel
upon
other
two
stakes
and
in
this
manner
they
fix
a
number
of
these
and
after
this
they
run
thick
stakes
through
the
length
of
the
horses
as
far
as
the
necks
and
they
mount
them
upon
the
wheels
and
the
front
pieces
of
wheel
support
the
shoulders
of
the
horses
while
those
behind
bear
up
their
bellies
going
by
the
side
of
the
thighs
and
both
front
and
hind
legs
hang
in
the
air
on
the
horses
they
put
bridles
and
bits
and
stretch
the
bridles
tight
in
front
of
them
and
then
tie
them
up
to
pegs
and
of
the
fifty
young
men
who
have
been
strangled
they
mount
each
one
upon
his
horse
having
first
run
a
straight
stake
through
each
body
along
by
the
spine
up
to
the
neck
and
a
part
of
this
stake
projects
below
which
they
fasten
into
a
socket
made
in
the
other
stake
that
runs
through
the
horse
having
set
horsemen
such
as
i
have
described
in
a
circle
round
the
tomb
they
then
ride
away
thus
they
bury
their
kings
but
as
for
the
other
scythians
when
they
die
their
nearest
relations
carry
them
round
laid
in
waggons
to
their
friends
in
succession
and
of
them
each
one
when
he
receives
the
body
entertains
those
who
accompany
it
and
before
the
corpse
they
serve
up
of
all
things
about
the
same
quantity
as
before
the
others
thus
private
persons
are
carried
about
for
forty
days
and
then
they
are
buried
and
after
burying
them
the
scythians
cleanse
themselves
in
the
following
way
soap
their
heads
and
wash
them
well
and
then
for
their
body
they
set
up
three
stakes
leaning
towards
one
another
and
about
them
they
stretch
woollen
felt
coverings
and
when
they
have
closed
them
as
much
as
possible
they
throw
stones
heated
into
a
basin
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
stakes
and
the
felt
coverings
now
they
have
hemp
growing
in
their
land
which
is
very
like
flax
except
in
thickness
and
in
height
for
in
these
respects
the
hemp
is
much
superior
this
grows
both
of
itself
and
with
cultivation
and
of
it
the
thracians
even
make
garments
which
are
very
like
those
made
of
flaxen
thread
so
that
he
who
was
not
specially
conversant
with
it
would
not
be
able
to
decide
whether
the
garments
were
of
flax
or
of
hemp
and
he
who
had
not
before
seen
stuff
woven
of
hemp
would
suppose
that
the
garment
was
made
of
flax
the
scythians
then
take
the
seed
of
this
hemp
and
creep
under
the
felt
coverings
and
then
they
throw
the
seed
upon
the
stones
which
have
been
heated
and
it
burns
like
incense
and
produces
a
vapour
so
thick
that
no
in
hellas
would
surpass
it
and
the
scythians
being
delighted
with
the
howl
like
wolves
this
is
to
them
instead
of
washing
for
in
fact
they
do
not
wash
their
bodies
at
all
in
water
their
women
however
pound
with
a
rough
stone
the
wood
of
the
cypress
and
cedar
and
frankincense
tree
pouring
in
water
with
it
and
then
with
this
pounded
stuff
which
is
thick
they
plaster
over
all
their
body
and
also
their
face
and
not
only
does
a
sweet
smell
attach
to
them
by
reason
of
this
but
also
when
they
take
off
the
plaster
on
the
next
day
their
skin
is
clean
and
shining
this
nation
also
is
very
averse
to
adopting
strange
customs
rejecting
even
those
of
other
tribes
among
themselves
but
especially
those
of
the
hellenes
as
the
history
of
anacharsis
and
also
afterwards
of
skyles
proved
for
as
to
anacharsis
first
when
he
was
returning
to
the
abodes
of
the
scythians
after
having
visited
many
lands
and
displayed
in
them
much
wisdom
as
he
sailed
through
the
hellespont
he
put
in
to
kyzicos
and
since
he
found
the
people
of
kyzicos
celebrating
a
festival
very
magnificently
in
honour
of
the
mother
of
the
gods
anacharsis
vowed
to
the
mother
that
if
he
should
return
safe
and
sound
to
his
own
land
he
would
both
sacrifice
to
her
with
the
same
rites
as
he
saw
the
men
of
kyzicos
do
and
also
hold
a
night
festival
so
when
he
came
to
scythia
he
went
down
into
the
region
called
hylaia
this
is
along
by
the
side
of
the
racecourse
of
achilles
and
is
quite
full
as
it
happens
of
trees
of
all
kinds
this
i
say
anacharsis
went
down
and
proceeded
to
perform
all
the
ceremonies
of
the
festival
in
honour
of
the
goddess
with
a
and
with
images
hung
about
himself
and
one
of
the
scythians
perceived
him
doing
this
and
declared
it
to
saulios
the
king
and
the
king
came
himself
also
and
when
he
saw
anacharsis
doing
this
he
shot
him
with
an
arrow
and
killed
him
accordingly
at
the
present
time
if
one
asks
about
anacharsis
the
scythians
say
that
they
do
not
know
him
and
for
this
reason
because
he
went
out
of
his
own
country
to
hellas
and
adopted
foreign
customs
and
as
i
heard
from
tymnes
the
steward
of
ariapeithes
he
was
the
uncle
on
the
side
of
idanthyrsos
king
of
the
scythians
and
the
son
of
gnuros
the
son
of
lycos
the
son
of
spargapeithes
if
then
anacharsis
was
of
this
house
let
him
know
that
he
died
by
the
hand
of
his
brother
for
idanthyrsos
was
the
son
of
saulios
and
saulios
was
he
who
killed
anacharsis
however
i
have
heard
also
another
story
told
by
the
peloponnesians
that
anacharsis
was
sent
out
by
the
king
of
the
scythians
and
so
made
himself
a
disciple
of
hellas
and
that
when
he
returned
back
he
said
to
him
that
had
sent
him
forth
that
the
hellenes
were
all
busied
about
every
kind
of
cleverness
except
the
lacedemonians
but
these
alone
knew
how
to
exchange
speech
sensibly
this
story
however
has
been
invented
without
any
ground
by
the
hellenes
themselves
and
however
that
may
be
the
man
was
slain
in
the
way
that
was
related
above
this
man
then
fared
thus
badly
by
reason
of
foreign
customs
and
communication
with
hellenes
and
very
many
years
afterwards
skyles
the
son
of
ariapeithes
suffered
nearly
the
same
fate
as
he
for
ariapeithes
the
king
of
the
scythians
with
other
sons
had
skyles
born
to
him
and
he
was
born
of
a
woman
who
was
of
istria
and
certainly
not
a
native
of
scythia
and
this
mother
taught
him
the
language
and
letters
of
hellas
afterwards
in
course
of
time
ariapeithes
was
brought
to
his
end
by
treachery
at
the
hands
of
spargapeithes
the
king
of
the
agathyrsians
and
skyles
succeeded
to
the
kingdom
and
he
took
not
only
that
but
also
the
wife
of
his
father
whose
name
was
opoia
this
opoia
was
a
native
scythian
and
from
her
was
born
oricos
to
ariapeithes
now
when
skyles
was
king
of
the
scythians
he
was
by
no
means
satisfied
with
the
scythian
manner
of
life
but
was
much
more
inclined
towards
hellenic
ways
because
of
the
training
with
which
he
had
been
brought
up
and
he
used
to
do
somewhat
as
follows
he
came
with
the
scythians
in
arms
to
the
city
of
the
borysthenites
now
these
borysthenites
say
that
they
are
of
miletos
skyles
came
to
these
he
would
leave
his
band
in
the
suburbs
of
the
city
and
go
himself
within
the
walls
and
close
the
gates
after
that
he
would
lay
aside
his
scythian
equipments
and
take
hellenic
garments
and
wearing
them
he
would
go
about
in
the
with
no
guards
or
any
other
man
accompanying
him
and
they
watched
the
gates
meanwhile
that
none
of
the
scythians
might
see
him
wearing
this
dress
and
while
in
other
respects
too
he
adopted
hellenic
manners
of
life
he
used
also
to
perform
worship
to
the
gods
according
to
the
customs
of
the
hellenes
then
having
stayed
a
month
or
more
than
that
he
would
put
on
the
scythian
dress
and
depart
this
he
did
many
times
and
he
both
built
for
himself
a
house
in
borysthenes
and
also
took
to
it
a
woman
of
the
place
as
his
wife
since
however
it
was
fated
that
evil
should
happen
to
him
it
happened
by
an
occasion
of
this
kind
formed
a
desire
to
be
initiated
in
the
rites
of
and
as
he
was
just
about
to
receive
the
initiation
there
happened
a
very
great
portent
he
had
in
the
city
of
the
borysthenites
a
house
of
great
size
and
built
with
large
expense
of
which
also
i
made
mention
a
little
before
this
and
round
it
were
placed
sphinxes
and
griffins
of
white
stone
on
this
house
zeus
caused
a
bolt
to
fall
and
the
house
was
altogether
burnt
down
but
skyles
none
the
less
for
this
completed
his
initiation
now
the
scythians
make
the
rites
of
bacchus
a
reproach
against
the
hellenes
for
they
say
that
it
is
not
fitting
to
invent
a
god
like
this
who
impels
men
to
frenzy
so
when
skyles
had
been
initiated
into
the
rites
of
bacchus
one
of
the
borysthenites
went
off
to
the
scythians
and
said
whereas
ye
laugh
at
us
o
scythians
because
we
perform
the
rite
of
bacchus
and
because
the
god
seizes
us
now
this
divinity
has
seized
also
your
king
and
he
is
both
joining
in
the
rite
of
bacchus
and
maddened
by
the
influence
of
the
god
and
if
ye
disbelieve
me
follow
and
i
will
show
you
the
chief
men
of
the
scythians
followed
him
and
the
borysthenite
led
them
secretly
into
the
town
and
set
them
upon
a
tower
so
when
skyles
passed
by
with
the
company
of
revellers
and
the
scythians
saw
him
joining
in
the
rite
of
bacchus
they
were
exceedingly
grieved
at
it
and
they
went
out
and
declared
to
the
whole
band
that
which
they
had
seen
after
this
when
skyles
was
riding
out
again
to
his
own
abode
the
scythians
took
his
brother
octamasades
for
their
leader
who
was
a
son
of
the
daughter
of
teres
and
made
insurrection
against
skyles
he
then
when
he
perceived
that
which
was
being
done
to
his
hurt
and
for
what
reason
it
was
being
done
fled
for
refuge
to
thrace
and
octamasades
being
informed
of
this
proceeded
to
march
upon
thrace
so
when
he
had
arrived
at
the
river
ister
the
thracians
met
him
and
as
they
were
about
to
engage
battle
sitalkes
sent
a
messenger
to
octamasades
and
said
why
must
we
make
trial
of
one
another
in
fight
thou
art
my
sister
son
and
thou
hast
in
thy
power
my
brother
do
thou
give
him
back
to
me
and
i
will
deliver
to
thee
thy
brother
skyles
and
let
us
not
either
of
us
set
our
armies
in
peril
either
thou
or
i
thus
sitalkes
proposed
to
him
by
a
herald
for
there
was
with
octamasades
a
brother
of
sitalkes
who
had
gone
into
exile
for
fear
of
him
and
octamasades
agreed
to
this
and
by
giving
up
his
own
mother
brother
to
sitalkes
he
received
his
brother
skyles
in
exchange
and
sitalkes
when
he
received
his
brother
led
him
away
as
a
prisoner
but
octamasades
cut
off
the
head
of
skyles
there
upon
the
spot
thus
do
the
scythians
carefully
guard
their
own
customary
observances
and
such
are
the
penalties
which
they
inflict
upon
those
who
acquire
foreign
customs
besides
their
own
how
many
the
scythians
are
i
was
not
able
to
ascertain
precisely
but
i
heard
various
reports
of
the
number
for
reports
say
both
that
they
are
very
many
in
number
and
also
that
they
are
few
at
least
as
regards
the
true
scythians
thus
far
however
they
gave
me
evidence
of
my
own
eyesight
is
between
the
river
borysthenes
and
the
hypanis
a
place
called
exampaios
of
which
also
i
made
mention
somewhat
before
this
saying
that
there
was
in
it
a
spring
of
bitter
water
from
which
the
water
flows
and
makes
the
river
hypanis
unfit
to
drink
in
this
place
there
is
set
a
bronze
bowl
in
size
at
least
six
times
as
large
as
the
at
the
entrance
of
the
pontus
which
pausanias
the
son
of
cleombrotos
dedicated
and
for
him
who
has
never
seen
that
i
will
make
the
matter
clear
by
saying
that
the
bowl
in
scythia
holds
easily
six
hundred
amphors
and
the
thickness
of
this
scythian
bowl
is
six
fingers
this
then
the
natives
of
the
place
told
me
had
been
made
of
for
their
king
they
said
whose
name
was
ariantas
wishing
to
know
how
many
the
scythians
were
ordered
all
the
scythians
to
bring
one
each
from
his
own
arrow
and
whosoever
should
not
bring
one
he
threatened
with
death
so
a
great
multitude
of
was
brought
and
he
resolved
to
make
of
them
a
memorial
and
to
leave
it
behind
him
from
these
then
they
said
he
made
this
bronze
bowl
and
dedicated
it
in
this
place
exampaios
this
is
what
i
heard
about
the
number
of
the
scythians
now
this
land
has
no
marvellous
things
except
that
it
has
rivers
which
are
by
far
larger
and
more
numerous
than
those
of
any
other
land
one
thing
however
shall
be
mentioned
which
it
has
to
show
and
which
is
worthy
of
wonder
even
besides
the
rivers
and
the
greatness
of
the
plain
that
is
to
say
they
point
out
a
footprint
of
heracles
in
the
rock
by
the
bank
of
the
river
tyras
which
in
shape
is
like
the
mark
of
a
man
foot
but
in
size
is
two
cubits
long
this
then
is
such
as
i
have
said
and
i
will
go
back
now
to
the
history
which
i
was
about
to
tell
at
first
while
dareios
was
preparing
to
go
against
the
scythians
and
was
sending
messengers
to
appoint
to
some
the
furnishing
of
a
to
others
that
of
ships
and
to
others
the
bridging
over
of
the
thracian
bosphorus
artabanos
the
son
of
hystaspes
and
brother
of
dareios
urged
him
by
no
means
to
make
the
march
against
the
scythians
telling
him
how
difficult
the
scythians
were
to
deal
with
since
however
he
did
not
persuade
him
though
he
gave
him
good
counsel
he
ceased
to
urge
and
dareios
when
all
his
preparations
had
been
made
began
to
march
his
army
forth
from
susa
then
one
of
the
persians
oiobazos
made
request
to
dareios
that
as
he
had
three
sons
and
all
were
serving
in
the
expedition
one
might
be
left
behind
for
him
and
dareios
said
that
as
he
was
a
friend
and
made
a
reasonable
request
he
would
leave
behind
all
the
sons
so
oiobazos
was
greatly
rejoiced
supposing
that
his
sons
had
been
freed
from
service
but
dareios
commanded
those
who
had
the
charge
of
such
things
to
put
to
death
all
the
sons
of
oiobazos
these
then
were
left
having
been
slain
upon
the
spot
where
they
were
and
dareios
meanwhile
set
forth
from
susa
and
arrived
at
the
place
on
the
bosphorus
where
the
bridge
of
ships
had
been
made
in
the
territory
of
chalcedon
and
there
he
embarked
in
a
ship
and
sailed
to
the
kyanean
rocks
which
the
hellenes
say
formerly
moved
backwards
and
forwards
and
taking
his
seat
at
the
temple
he
gazed
upon
the
pontus
which
is
a
sight
well
worth
seeing
of
all
seas
indeed
it
is
the
most
marvellous
in
its
nature
the
length
of
it
is
eleven
thousand
one
hundred
furlongs
and
the
breadth
where
it
is
broadest
three
thousand
three
hundred
and
of
this
great
sea
the
mouth
is
but
four
furlongs
broad
and
the
length
of
the
mouth
that
is
of
the
neck
of
water
which
is
called
bosphorus
where
as
i
said
the
bridge
of
ships
had
been
made
is
not
less
than
a
hundred
and
twenty
furlongs
this
bosphorus
extends
to
the
propontis
and
the
propontis
being
in
breadth
five
hundred
furlongs
and
in
length
one
thousand
four
hundred
has
its
outlet
into
the
hellespont
which
is
but
seven
furlongs
broad
at
the
narrowest
place
though
it
is
four
hundred
furlongs
in
length
and
the
hellespont
runs
out
into
that
expanse
of
sea
which
is
called
the
egean
these
measurements
i
have
made
as
follows
ship
completes
on
an
average
in
a
long
day
a
distance
of
seventy
thousand
fathoms
and
in
a
night
sixty
thousand
now
we
know
that
to
the
river
phasis
from
the
mouth
of
the
sea
for
it
is
here
that
the
pontus
is
longest
is
a
voyage
of
nine
days
and
eight
nights
which
amounts
to
one
hundred
and
eleven
myriads
of
fathoms
and
these
fathoms
are
eleven
thousand
one
hundred
furlongs
then
from
the
land
of
the
sindians
to
themiskyra
on
the
river
thermodon
for
here
is
the
broadest
part
of
the
pontus
it
is
a
voyage
of
three
days
and
two
nights
which
amounts
to
myriads
of
fathoms
or
three
thousand
three
hundred
furlongs
this
pontus
then
and
also
the
bosphorus
and
the
hellespont
have
been
measured
by
me
thus
and
their
nature
is
such
as
has
been
said
and
this
pontus
also
has
a
lake
which
has
its
outlet
into
it
which
lake
is
not
much
less
in
size
than
the
pontus
itself
and
it
is
called
maiotis
and
mother
of
the
pontus
dareios
then
having
gazed
upon
the
pontus
sailed
back
to
the
bridge
of
which
mandrocles
a
samian
had
been
chief
constructor
and
having
gazed
upon
the
bosphorus
also
he
set
up
two
pillars
by
it
of
white
stone
with
characters
cut
upon
them
on
the
one
assyrian
and
on
the
other
hellenic
being
the
names
of
all
the
nations
which
he
was
leading
with
him
and
he
was
leading
with
him
all
over
whom
he
was
ruler
the
whole
number
of
them
without
the
naval
force
was
reckoned
to
be
seventy
myriads
including
cavalry
and
ships
had
been
gathered
together
to
the
number
of
six
hundred
these
pillars
the
byzantians
conveyed
to
their
city
after
the
events
of
which
i
speak
and
used
them
for
the
altar
of
artemis
orthosia
excepting
one
stone
which
was
left
standing
by
the
side
of
the
temple
of
dionysos
in
byzantion
covered
over
with
assyrian
characters
now
the
place
on
the
bosphorus
where
dareios
made
his
bridge
is
as
i
conclude
midway
between
byzantion
and
the
temple
at
the
mouth
of
the
pontus
after
this
dareios
being
pleased
with
the
floating
bridge
rewarded
the
chief
constructor
of
it
mandrocles
the
samian
with
gifts
tenfold
and
as
an
offering
from
these
mandrocles
had
a
painting
made
of
figures
to
present
the
whole
scene
of
the
bridge
over
the
bosphorus
and
king
dareios
sitting
in
a
prominent
seat
and
his
army
crossing
over
this
he
caused
to
be
painted
and
dedicated
it
as
an
offering
in
the
temple
of
hera
with
the
following
inscription
bosphorus
having
bridged
over
the
straits
to
hera
mandrocleës
dedicates
this
of
his
work
to
record
a
crown
on
himself
he
set
and
he
brought
to
the
samians
glory
and
for
dareios
performed
everything
after
his
mind
this
memorial
was
made
of
him
who
constructed
the
bridge
and
dareios
after
he
had
rewarded
mandrocles
with
gifts
passed
over
into
europe
having
first
commanded
the
ionians
to
sail
into
the
pontus
as
far
as
the
river
ister
and
when
they
arrived
at
the
ister
there
to
wait
for
him
making
a
bridge
meanwhile
over
the
river
for
the
chief
of
his
naval
force
were
the
ionians
the
aiolians
and
the
hellespontians
so
the
fleet
sailed
through
between
the
kyanean
rocks
and
made
straight
for
the
ister
and
then
they
sailed
up
the
river
a
two
days
voyage
from
the
sea
and
proceeded
to
make
a
bridge
across
the
neck
as
it
were
of
the
river
where
the
mouths
of
the
ister
part
off
dareios
meanwhile
having
crossed
the
bosphorus
on
the
floating
bridge
was
advancing
through
thrace
and
when
he
came
to
the
sources
of
the
river
tearos
he
encamped
for
three
days
now
the
tearos
is
said
by
those
who
dwell
near
it
to
be
the
best
of
all
rivers
both
in
other
respects
which
tend
to
healing
and
especially
for
curing
diseases
of
the
skin
both
in
men
and
in
horses
and
its
springs
are
in
number
flowing
all
from
the
same
rock
of
which
some
are
cold
and
others
warm
the
way
to
them
is
of
equal
length
from
the
city
of
heraion
near
perinthos
and
from
apollonia
upon
the
euxine
sea
that
is
to
say
two
days
journey
by
each
road
this
tearos
runs
into
the
river
contadesdos
and
the
contadesdos
into
the
agrianes
and
the
agrianes
into
the
hebros
which
flows
into
the
sea
by
the
city
of
ainos
dareios
then
having
come
to
this
river
and
having
encamped
there
was
pleased
with
the
river
and
set
up
a
pillar
there
also
with
an
inscription
as
follows
the
of
the
river
tearos
give
the
best
and
fairest
water
of
all
rivers
and
to
them
came
leading
an
army
against
the
scythians
the
best
and
fairest
of
all
men
dareios
the
son
of
hystaspes
of
the
persians
and
of
all
the
continent
king
these
were
the
words
which
were
there
written
dareios
then
set
out
from
thence
and
came
to
another
river
whose
name
is
artescos
which
flows
through
the
land
of
the
odrysians
having
come
to
this
river
he
did
as
follows
appointed
a
place
for
his
army
and
bade
every
man
as
he
passed
out
by
it
place
one
stone
in
this
appointed
place
and
when
the
army
had
performed
this
then
he
marched
away
his
army
leaving
behind
great
mounds
of
these
stones
but
before
he
came
to
the
ister
he
conquered
first
the
getai
who
believe
in
immortality
for
the
thracians
who
occupy
salmydessos
and
are
settled
above
the
cities
of
apollonian
and
mesambria
called
the
kyrmianai
and
the
nipsaioi
delivered
themselves
over
to
dareios
without
fighting
but
the
getai
who
are
the
bravest
and
the
most
upright
in
their
dealings
of
all
the
thracians
having
betaken
themselves
to
obstinacy
were
forthwith
subdued
and
their
belief
in
immortality
is
of
this
kind
that
is
to
say
they
hold
that
they
do
not
die
but
that
he
who
is
killed
goes
to
salmoxis
a
divinity
whom
some
of
them
call
gebeleizis
and
at
intervals
of
four
years
they
send
one
of
themselves
whomsoever
the
lot
may
select
as
a
messenger
to
salmoxis
charging
him
with
such
requests
as
they
have
to
make
on
each
occasion
and
they
send
him
thus
of
them
who
are
appointed
for
this
have
three
javelins
and
others
meanwhile
take
hold
on
both
sides
of
him
who
is
being
sent
to
salmoxis
both
by
his
hands
and
his
feet
and
first
they
swing
him
up
then
throw
him
into
the
air
so
as
to
fall
upon
the
and
if
when
he
is
pierced
through
he
is
killed
they
think
that
the
god
is
favourable
to
them
but
if
he
is
not
killed
they
find
fault
with
the
messenger
himself
calling
him
a
worthless
man
and
then
having
found
fault
with
him
they
send
another
and
they
give
him
the
charge
beforehand
while
he
is
yet
alive
these
same
thracians
also
shoot
arrows
up
towards
the
sky
when
thunder
and
lightning
come
and
use
threats
to
the
god
not
believing
that
there
exists
any
other
god
except
their
own
this
salmoxis
i
hear
from
the
hellenes
who
dwell
about
the
hellespont
and
the
pontus
was
a
man
and
he
became
a
slave
in
samos
and
was
in
fact
a
slave
of
pythagoras
the
son
of
mnesarchos
then
having
become
free
he
gained
great
wealth
and
afterwards
returned
to
his
own
land
and
as
the
thracians
both
live
hardly
and
are
rather
this
salmoxis
being
acquainted
with
the
ionian
way
of
living
and
with
manners
more
cultivated
than
the
thracians
were
used
to
see
since
he
had
associated
with
hellenes
and
not
only
that
but
with
pythagoras
not
the
least
able
philosopher
of
the
hellenes
prepared
a
where
he
received
and
feasted
the
chief
men
of
the
tribe
and
instructed
them
meanwhile
that
neither
he
himself
nor
his
guests
nor
their
descendants
in
succession
after
them
would
die
but
that
they
would
come
to
a
place
where
they
would
live
for
ever
and
have
all
things
good
while
he
was
doing
that
which
has
been
mentioned
and
was
saying
these
things
he
was
making
for
himself
meanwhile
a
chamber
under
the
ground
and
when
his
chamber
was
finished
he
disappeared
from
among
the
thracians
and
went
down
into
the
underground
chamber
where
he
continued
to
live
for
three
years
and
they
grieved
for
his
loss
and
mourned
for
him
as
dead
then
in
the
fourth
year
he
appeared
to
the
thracians
and
in
this
way
the
things
which
salmoxis
said
became
credible
to
them
thus
they
say
that
he
did
but
as
to
this
matter
and
the
chamber
under
ground
i
neither
disbelieve
it
nor
do
i
very
strongly
believe
but
i
think
that
this
salmoxis
lived
many
years
before
pythagoras
however
whether
there
ever
lived
a
man
salmoxis
or
whether
he
is
simply
a
native
deity
of
the
getai
let
us
bid
farewell
to
him
now
these
i
say
having
such
manners
as
i
have
said
were
subdued
by
the
persians
and
accompanied
the
rest
of
the
army
and
when
dareios
and
with
him
the
arrived
at
the
ister
then
after
all
had
passed
over
dareios
commanded
the
ionians
to
break
up
the
floating
bridge
and
to
accompany
him
by
land
as
well
as
the
rest
of
the
troops
which
were
in
the
ships
and
when
the
ionians
were
just
about
to
break
it
up
and
to
do
that
which
he
commanded
coës
the
son
of
erxander
who
was
commander
of
the
mytilenians
said
thus
to
dareios
having
first
inquired
whether
he
was
disposed
to
listen
to
an
opinion
from
one
who
desired
to
declare
it
o
king
seeing
that
thou
art
about
to
march
upon
a
land
where
no
cultivated
ground
will
be
seen
nor
any
inhabited
town
do
thou
therefore
let
this
bridge
remain
where
it
is
leaving
to
guard
it
those
same
men
who
constructed
it
then
if
we
find
the
scythians
and
fare
as
we
desire
we
have
a
way
of
return
and
also
even
if
we
shall
not
be
able
to
find
them
at
least
our
way
of
return
is
secured
for
that
we
should
be
worsted
by
the
scythians
in
fight
i
never
feared
yet
but
rather
that
we
might
not
be
able
to
find
them
and
might
suffer
some
disaster
in
wandering
about
perhaps
some
one
will
say
that
in
speaking
thus
i
am
speaking
for
my
own
advantage
in
order
that
i
may
remain
behind
but
in
truth
i
am
bringing
forward
o
king
the
opinion
which
i
found
best
for
thee
and
i
myself
will
accompany
thee
and
not
be
left
behind
with
this
opinion
dareios
was
very
greatly
pleased
and
made
answer
to
him
in
these
words
friend
from
lesbos
when
i
have
returned
safe
to
my
house
be
sure
that
thou
appear
before
me
in
order
that
i
may
requite
thee
with
good
deeds
for
good
counsel
having
thus
said
and
having
tied
sixty
knots
in
a
thong
he
called
the
despots
of
the
ionians
to
speak
with
him
and
said
as
follows
men
of
ionia
know
that
i
have
given
up
the
opinion
which
i
formerly
declared
with
regard
to
the
bridge
and
do
ye
keep
this
thong
and
do
as
i
shall
say
soon
as
ye
shall
have
seen
me
go
forward
against
the
scythians
from
that
time
begin
and
untie
a
knot
on
each
day
and
if
within
this
time
i
am
not
here
and
ye
find
that
the
days
marked
by
the
knots
have
passed
by
then
sail
away
to
your
own
lands
till
then
since
our
resolve
has
thus
been
changed
guard
the
floating
bridge
showing
all
diligence
to
keep
it
safe
and
to
guard
it
and
thus
acting
ye
will
do
for
me
a
very
acceptable
service
thus
said
dareios
and
hastened
on
his
march
forwards
now
in
front
of
scythia
in
the
direction
towards
the
sea
lies
thrace
and
where
a
bay
is
formed
in
this
land
there
begins
scythia
into
which
the
ister
flows
out
the
mouth
of
the
river
being
turned
towards
the
wind
beginning
at
the
ister
then
i
am
about
to
describe
the
coast
land
of
the
true
scythia
with
regard
to
measurement
at
once
from
the
ister
begins
this
original
land
of
scythia
and
it
lies
towards
the
midday
and
the
south
wind
extending
as
far
as
the
city
called
carkinitis
after
this
the
part
which
lies
on
the
coast
of
the
same
sea
still
a
country
which
is
mountainous
and
runs
out
in
the
direction
of
the
pontus
is
occupied
by
the
tauric
race
as
far
as
the
peninsula
which
is
called
the
rugged
chersonese
and
this
extends
to
the
sea
which
lies
towards
the
east
wind
for
two
sides
of
the
scythian
boundaries
lie
along
by
the
sea
one
by
the
sea
on
the
south
and
the
other
by
that
on
the
east
just
as
it
is
with
attica
and
in
truth
the
tauroi
occupy
a
part
of
scythia
which
has
much
resemblance
to
attica
it
is
as
if
in
attica
another
race
and
not
the
athenians
occupied
the
hill
region
of
sunion
supposing
it
to
project
more
at
the
point
into
the
sea
that
region
namely
which
is
cut
off
by
a
line
from
thoricos
to
anaphlystos
such
i
say
if
we
may
be
allowed
to
compare
small
things
such
as
this
with
great
is
the
form
of
the
tauric
land
for
him
however
who
has
not
sailed
along
this
part
of
the
coast
of
attica
i
will
make
it
clear
by
another
comparison
is
as
if
in
iapygia
another
race
and
not
the
iapygians
had
cut
off
for
themselves
and
were
holding
that
extremity
of
the
land
which
is
bounded
by
a
line
beginning
at
the
harbour
of
brentesion
and
running
to
taras
and
in
mentioning
these
two
similar
cases
i
am
suggesting
many
other
things
also
to
which
the
tauric
land
has
resemblance
after
the
tauric
land
immediately
come
scythians
again
occupying
the
parts
above
the
tauroi
and
the
coasts
of
the
eastern
sea
that
is
to
say
the
parts
to
the
west
of
the
kimmerian
bosphorus
and
of
the
maiotian
lake
as
far
as
the
river
tanaïs
which
runs
into
the
corner
of
this
lake
in
the
upper
parts
which
tend
inland
scythia
is
bounded
as
we
know
by
the
agathyrsians
first
beginning
from
the
ister
and
then
by
the
neuroi
afterwards
by
the
androphagoi
and
lastly
by
the
melanchlainoi
scythia
then
being
looked
upon
as
a
figure
with
two
of
its
sides
bordered
by
the
sea
has
its
border
lines
equal
to
one
another
in
each
direction
that
which
tends
inland
and
that
which
runs
along
by
the
sea
for
from
ister
to
the
borysthenes
is
ten
days
journey
and
from
the
borysthenes
to
the
maiotian
lake
ten
days
more
and
the
distance
inland
to
the
melanchlainoi
who
are
settled
above
the
scythians
is
a
journey
of
twenty
days
now
i
have
reckoned
the
journey
at
two
hundred
furlongs
and
by
this
reckoning
the
cross
lines
of
scythia
would
be
four
thousand
furlongs
in
length
and
the
perpendiculars
which
tend
inland
would
be
the
same
number
of
furlongs
such
is
the
size
of
this
land
the
scythians
meanwhile
having
considered
with
themselves
that
they
were
not
able
to
repel
the
army
of
dareios
alone
by
a
pitched
battle
proceeded
to
send
messengers
to
those
who
dwelt
near
them
and
already
the
kings
of
these
nations
had
come
together
and
were
taking
counsel
with
one
another
since
so
great
an
army
was
marching
towards
them
now
those
who
had
come
together
were
the
kings
of
the
tauroi
agathyrsians
neuroi
androphagoi
melanchlainoi
gelonians
budinoi
and
sauromatai
of
these
the
tauroi
have
the
following
customs
sacrifice
to
the
maiden
both
persons
and
also
those
hellenes
whom
they
can
capture
by
putting
out
to
sea
against
them
and
their
manner
of
sacrifice
is
this
they
have
made
the
first
offering
from
the
victim
they
strike
his
head
with
a
club
and
some
say
that
they
push
the
body
down
from
the
top
of
the
cliff
for
it
is
upon
a
cliff
that
the
temple
is
placed
and
set
the
head
up
on
a
stake
but
others
while
agreeing
as
to
the
heads
say
nevertheless
that
the
body
is
not
pushed
down
from
the
top
of
the
cliff
but
buried
in
the
earth
this
divinity
to
whom
they
sacrifice
the
tauroi
themselves
say
is
iphigeneia
the
daughter
of
agamemnon
whatsoever
enemies
they
have
conquered
they
treat
in
this
fashion
man
cuts
off
a
head
and
bears
it
away
to
his
house
then
he
impales
it
on
a
long
stake
and
sets
it
up
above
his
house
raised
to
a
great
height
generally
above
the
chimney
and
they
say
that
these
are
suspended
above
as
guards
to
preserve
the
whole
house
this
people
has
its
living
by
plunder
and
war
the
agathyrsians
are
the
most
luxurious
of
men
and
wear
gold
ornaments
for
the
most
part
also
they
have
promiscuous
intercourse
with
their
women
in
order
that
they
may
be
brethren
to
one
another
and
being
all
nearly
related
may
not
feel
envy
or
malice
one
against
another
in
their
other
customs
they
have
come
to
resemble
the
thracians
the
neuroi
practise
the
scythian
customs
and
one
generation
before
the
expedition
of
dareios
it
so
befell
them
that
they
were
forced
to
quit
their
land
altogether
by
reason
of
serpents
for
their
land
produced
serpents
in
vast
numbers
and
they
fell
upon
them
in
still
larger
numbers
from
the
desert
country
above
their
borders
until
at
last
being
hard
pressed
they
left
their
own
land
and
settled
among
the
budinoi
these
men
it
would
seem
are
wizards
for
it
is
said
of
them
by
the
scythians
and
by
the
hellenes
who
are
settled
in
the
scythian
land
that
once
in
every
year
each
of
the
neuroi
becomes
a
wolf
for
a
few
days
and
then
returns
again
to
his
original
form
for
my
part
i
do
not
believe
them
when
they
say
this
but
they
say
it
nevertheless
and
swear
it
moreover
the
androphagoi
have
the
most
savage
manners
of
all
human
beings
and
they
neither
acknowledge
any
rule
of
right
nor
observe
any
customary
law
they
are
nomads
and
wear
clothing
like
that
of
the
scythians
but
have
a
language
of
their
own
and
alone
of
all
these
nations
they
are
the
melanchlainoi
wear
all
of
them
black
clothing
whence
also
they
have
their
name
and
they
practise
the
customs
of
the
scythians
the
budinoi
are
a
very
great
and
numerous
race
and
are
all
very
and
fair
of
skin
and
in
their
land
is
built
a
city
of
wood
the
name
of
which
is
gelonos
and
each
side
of
the
wall
is
thirty
furlongs
in
length
and
lofty
at
the
same
time
all
being
of
wood
and
the
houses
are
of
wood
also
and
the
temples
for
there
are
in
it
temples
of
hellenic
gods
furnished
after
hellenic
fashion
with
sacred
images
and
altars
and
cells
all
of
wood
and
they
keep
festivals
every
other
year
to
dionysos
and
celebrate
the
rites
of
bacchus
for
the
gelonians
are
originally
hellenes
and
they
removed
from
the
trading
stations
on
the
coast
and
settled
among
the
budinoi
and
they
use
partly
the
scythian
language
and
partly
the
hellenic
the
budinoi
however
do
not
use
the
same
language
as
the
gelonians
nor
is
their
manner
of
living
the
same
for
the
budinoi
are
natives
of
the
soil
and
a
nomad
people
and
alone
of
the
nations
in
these
parts
feed
on
but
the
gelonians
are
tillers
of
the
ground
and
feed
on
corn
and
have
gardens
and
resemble
them
not
at
all
either
in
appearance
or
in
complexion
of
skin
however
by
the
hellenes
the
budinoi
also
are
called
gelonians
not
being
rightly
so
called
their
land
is
all
thickly
overgrown
with
forests
of
all
kinds
of
trees
and
in
the
thickest
forest
there
is
a
large
and
deep
lake
and
round
it
marshy
ground
and
reeds
in
this
are
caught
otters
and
beavers
and
certainly
other
wild
animals
with
faces
the
fur
of
these
is
sewn
as
a
fringe
round
their
coats
of
skin
and
the
testicles
are
made
use
of
by
them
for
curing
diseases
of
the
womb
about
the
sauromatai
the
following
tale
is
told
the
hellenes
had
fought
with
the
amazons
the
amazons
are
called
by
the
scythians
oiorpata
which
name
means
in
the
hellenic
tongue
slayers
of
men
for
man
they
call
oior
and
pata
means
to
slay
as
the
story
goes
the
hellenes
having
conquered
them
in
the
battle
at
the
thermodon
were
sailing
away
and
conveying
with
them
in
three
ships
as
many
amazons
as
they
were
able
to
take
prisoners
these
in
the
open
sea
set
upon
the
men
and
cast
them
out
of
the
ships
but
they
knew
nothing
about
ships
nor
how
to
use
rudders
or
sails
or
oars
and
after
they
had
cast
out
the
men
they
were
driven
about
by
wave
and
wind
and
came
to
that
part
of
the
maiotian
lake
where
cremnoi
stands
now
cremnoi
is
in
the
land
of
the
free
scythians
there
the
amazons
disembarked
from
their
ships
and
made
their
way
into
the
country
and
having
met
first
with
a
troop
of
horses
feeding
they
seized
them
and
mounted
upon
these
they
plundered
the
property
of
the
scythians
the
scythians
meanwhile
were
not
able
to
understand
the
matter
for
they
did
not
know
either
their
speech
or
their
dress
or
the
race
to
which
they
belonged
but
were
in
wonder
as
to
whence
they
had
come
and
thought
that
they
were
men
of
an
age
corresponding
to
their
appearance
and
finally
they
fought
a
battle
against
them
and
after
the
battle
the
scythians
got
possession
of
the
bodies
of
the
dead
and
thus
they
discovered
that
they
were
women
they
took
counsel
therefore
and
resolved
by
no
means
to
go
on
trying
to
kill
them
but
to
send
against
them
the
youngest
men
from
among
themselves
making
conjecture
of
the
number
so
as
to
send
just
as
many
men
as
there
were
women
these
were
told
to
encamp
near
them
and
do
whatsoever
they
should
do
if
however
the
women
should
come
after
them
they
were
not
to
fight
but
to
retire
before
them
and
when
the
women
stopped
they
were
to
approach
near
and
encamp
this
plan
was
adopted
by
the
scythians
because
they
desired
to
have
children
born
from
them
the
young
men
accordingly
were
sent
out
and
did
that
which
had
been
commanded
them
and
when
the
amazons
perceived
that
they
had
not
come
to
do
them
any
harm
they
let
them
alone
and
the
two
camps
approached
nearer
to
one
another
every
day
and
the
young
men
like
the
amazons
had
nothing
except
their
arms
and
their
horses
and
got
their
living
as
the
amazons
did
by
hunting
and
by
taking
booty
now
the
amazons
at
midday
used
to
scatter
abroad
either
one
by
one
or
by
two
together
dispersing
to
a
distance
from
one
another
to
ease
themselves
and
the
scythians
also
having
perceived
this
did
the
same
thing
and
one
of
the
scythians
came
near
to
one
of
those
amazons
who
were
apart
by
themselves
and
she
did
not
repulse
him
but
allowed
him
to
lie
with
her
and
she
could
not
speak
to
him
for
they
did
not
understand
one
another
speech
but
she
made
signs
to
him
with
her
hand
to
come
on
the
following
day
to
the
same
place
and
to
bring
another
with
him
signifying
to
him
that
there
should
be
two
of
them
and
that
she
would
bring
another
with
her
the
young
man
therefore
when
he
returned
reported
this
to
the
others
and
on
the
next
day
he
came
himself
to
the
place
and
also
brought
another
and
he
found
the
amazon
awaiting
him
with
another
in
her
company
then
hearing
this
the
rest
of
the
young
men
also
in
their
turn
tamed
for
themselves
the
remainder
of
the
amazons
and
after
this
they
joined
their
camps
and
lived
together
each
man
having
for
his
wife
her
with
whom
he
had
had
dealings
at
first
and
the
men
were
not
able
to
learn
the
speech
of
the
women
but
the
women
came
to
comprehend
that
of
the
men
so
when
they
understood
one
another
the
men
spoke
to
the
amazons
as
follows
we
have
parents
and
we
have
possessions
now
therefore
let
us
no
longer
lead
a
life
of
this
kind
but
let
us
go
away
to
the
main
body
of
our
people
and
dwell
with
them
and
we
will
have
you
for
wives
and
no
others
they
however
spoke
thus
in
reply
we
should
not
be
able
to
live
with
your
women
for
we
and
they
have
not
the
same
customs
we
shoot
with
bows
and
hurl
javelins
and
ride
horses
but
the
works
of
women
we
never
learnt
whereas
your
women
do
none
of
these
things
which
we
said
but
stay
in
the
waggons
and
work
at
the
works
of
women
neither
going
out
to
the
chase
nor
anywhither
else
we
therefore
should
not
be
able
to
live
in
agreement
with
them
but
if
ye
desire
to
keep
us
for
your
wives
and
to
be
thought
honest
men
go
to
your
parents
and
obtain
from
them
your
share
of
the
goods
and
then
let
us
go
and
dwell
by
ourselves
the
young
men
agreed
and
did
this
and
when
they
had
obtained
the
share
of
the
goods
which
belonged
to
them
and
had
returned
back
to
the
amazons
the
women
spoke
to
them
as
follows
we
are
possessed
by
fear
and
trembling
to
think
that
we
must
dwell
in
this
place
having
not
only
separated
you
from
your
fathers
but
also
done
great
damage
to
your
land
since
then
ye
think
it
right
to
have
us
as
your
wives
do
this
together
with
us
and
let
us
remove
from
this
land
and
pass
over
the
river
tanaïs
and
there
dwell
the
young
men
agreed
to
this
also
and
they
crossed
over
the
tanaïs
and
made
their
way
towards
the
rising
sun
for
three
days
journey
from
tanaïs
and
also
towards
the
north
wind
for
three
days
journey
from
the
maiotian
lake
and
having
arrived
at
the
place
where
they
are
now
settled
they
took
up
their
abode
there
and
from
thenceforward
the
women
of
the
sauromatai
practise
their
ancient
way
of
living
going
out
regularly
on
horseback
to
the
chase
both
in
company
with
the
men
and
apart
from
them
and
going
regularly
to
war
and
wearing
the
same
dress
as
the
men
and
the
sauromatai
make
use
of
the
scythian
tongue
speaking
it
barbarously
however
from
the
first
since
the
amazons
did
not
learn
it
thoroughly
well
as
regards
marriages
their
rule
is
this
that
no
maiden
is
married
until
she
has
slain
a
man
of
their
enemies
and
some
of
them
even
grow
old
and
die
before
they
are
married
because
they
are
not
able
to
fulfil
the
requirement
of
the
law
to
the
kings
of
these
nations
then
which
have
been
mentioned
in
order
the
messengers
of
the
scythians
came
finding
them
gathered
together
and
spoke
declaring
to
them
how
the
persian
king
after
having
subdued
all
things
to
himself
in
the
other
continent
had
laid
a
bridge
over
the
neck
of
the
bosphorus
and
had
crossed
over
to
that
continent
and
having
crossed
over
and
subdued
the
thracians
was
making
a
bridge
over
the
river
ister
desiring
to
bring
under
his
power
all
these
regions
also
do
ye
therefore
they
said
by
no
means
stand
aloof
and
allow
us
to
be
destroyed
but
let
us
become
all
of
one
mind
and
oppose
him
who
is
coming
against
us
if
ye
shall
not
do
so
we
on
our
part
shall
either
be
forced
by
necessity
to
leave
our
land
or
we
shall
stay
in
it
and
make
a
treaty
with
the
invader
for
what
else
can
we
do
if
ye
are
not
willing
to
help
us
and
for
you
after
this
it
will
be
in
no
respect
easier
for
the
persian
has
come
not
at
all
less
against
you
than
against
us
nor
will
it
content
him
to
subdue
us
and
abstain
from
you
and
of
the
truth
of
that
which
we
say
we
will
mention
a
strong
evidence
if
the
persian
had
been
making
his
expedition
against
us
alone
because
he
desired
to
take
vengeance
for
the
former
servitude
he
ought
to
have
abstained
from
all
the
rest
and
to
have
come
at
once
to
invade
our
land
and
he
would
thus
have
made
it
clear
to
all
that
he
was
marching
to
fight
against
the
scythians
and
not
against
the
rest
in
fact
however
ever
since
he
crossed
over
to
this
continent
he
has
compelled
all
who
came
in
his
way
to
submit
to
him
and
he
holds
under
him
now
not
only
the
other
thracians
but
also
the
getai
who
are
our
nearest
neighbours
when
the
scythians
proposed
this
the
kings
who
had
come
from
the
various
nations
took
counsel
together
and
their
opinions
were
divided
the
kings
of
the
gelonians
of
the
budinoi
and
of
the
sauromatai
agreed
together
and
accepted
the
proposal
that
they
should
help
the
scythians
but
those
of
the
agathyrsians
neuroi
androphagoi
melanchlainoi
and
tauroi
returned
answer
to
the
scythians
as
follows
if
ye
had
not
been
the
first
to
do
wrong
to
the
persians
and
to
begin
war
then
we
should
have
surely
thought
that
ye
were
speaking
justly
in
asking
for
those
things
for
which
ye
now
ask
and
we
should
have
yielded
to
your
request
and
shared
your
fortunes
as
it
is
however
ye
on
the
one
hand
made
invasion
without
us
into
their
land
and
bare
rule
over
the
persians
for
so
long
a
time
as
god
permitted
you
and
they
in
their
turn
since
the
same
god
stirs
them
up
are
repaying
you
with
the
like
as
for
us
however
neither
at
that
time
did
we
do
any
wrong
to
these
men
nor
now
shall
we
attempt
to
do
any
wrong
to
them
unprovoked
if
however
the
persians
shall
come
against
our
land
also
and
do
wrong
first
to
us
we
also
shall
refuse
to
submit
but
until
we
shall
see
this
we
shall
remain
by
ourselves
for
we
are
of
opinion
that
the
persians
have
come
not
against
us
but
against
those
who
were
the
authors
of
the
wrong
when
the
scythians
heard
this
answer
reported
they
planned
not
to
fight
a
pitched
battle
openly
since
these
did
not
join
them
as
allies
but
to
retire
before
the
persians
and
to
drive
away
their
cattle
from
before
them
choking
up
with
earth
the
wells
and
the
springs
of
water
by
which
they
passed
and
destroying
the
grass
from
off
the
ground
having
parted
themselves
for
this
into
two
bodies
and
they
resolved
that
the
sauromatai
should
be
added
to
one
of
their
divisions
namely
that
over
which
scopasis
was
king
and
that
these
should
move
on
if
the
persians
turned
in
that
direction
straight
towards
the
river
tanaïs
retreating
before
him
by
the
shore
of
the
maiotian
lake
and
when
the
persian
marched
back
again
they
should
come
after
and
pursue
him
this
was
one
division
of
their
kingdom
appointed
to
go
by
the
way
which
has
been
said
and
the
other
two
of
the
kingdoms
the
large
one
over
which
idanthyrsos
was
king
and
the
third
of
which
taxakis
was
king
were
to
join
together
in
one
with
the
gelonians
and
the
budinoi
added
to
them
and
they
also
were
to
retire
before
the
persians
one
day
march
in
front
of
them
going
on
out
of
their
way
and
doing
that
which
had
been
planned
first
they
were
to
move
on
straight
for
the
countries
which
had
refused
to
give
their
alliance
in
order
that
they
might
involve
these
also
in
the
war
and
though
these
had
not
voluntarily
undertaken
the
war
with
the
persians
they
were
to
involve
them
in
it
nevertheless
against
their
will
and
after
that
they
were
to
return
to
their
own
land
and
attack
the
enemy
if
it
should
seem
good
to
them
in
council
so
to
do
having
formed
this
plan
the
scythians
went
to
meet
the
army
of
dareios
sending
off
the
best
of
their
horsemen
before
them
as
scouts
but
all
the
waggons
in
which
their
children
and
their
women
lived
they
sent
on
and
with
them
all
their
cattle
leaving
only
so
much
as
was
sufficient
to
supply
them
with
food
and
charged
them
that
they
should
proceed
continually
towards
the
north
wind
these
i
say
were
being
carried
on
before
but
when
the
scouts
who
went
in
front
of
the
scythians
discovered
the
persians
distant
about
three
days
march
from
ister
then
the
scythians
having
discovered
them
continued
to
pitch
their
camp
one
march
in
front
destroying
utterly
that
which
grew
from
the
ground
and
when
the
persians
saw
that
the
horsemen
of
the
scythians
had
made
their
appearance
they
came
after
them
following
in
their
track
while
the
scythians
continually
moved
on
after
this
since
they
had
directed
their
march
towards
the
first
of
the
divisions
the
persians
continued
to
pursue
towards
the
east
and
the
river
tanaïs
and
when
the
scythians
crossed
over
the
river
tanaïs
the
persians
crossed
over
after
them
and
continued
still
to
pursue
until
they
had
passed
quite
through
the
land
of
the
sauromatai
and
had
come
to
that
of
the
budinoi
now
so
long
as
the
persians
were
passing
through
scythia
and
the
land
of
the
sauromatai
they
had
nothing
to
destroy
seeing
that
the
land
was
bare
but
when
they
invaded
the
land
of
the
budinoi
then
they
fell
in
with
the
wooden
wall
which
had
been
deserted
by
the
budinoi
and
left
wholly
unoccupied
and
this
they
destroyed
by
fire
having
done
so
they
continued
to
follow
on
further
in
the
tracks
of
the
enemy
until
they
had
passed
through
the
whole
of
this
land
and
had
arrived
at
the
desert
this
desert
region
is
occupied
by
no
men
and
it
lies
above
the
land
of
the
budinoi
extending
for
a
seven
days
journey
and
above
this
desert
dwell
the
thyssagetai
and
four
large
rivers
flow
from
them
through
the
land
of
the
maiotians
and
run
into
that
which
is
called
the
maiotian
lake
their
names
being
as
follows
oaros
tanaïs
syrgis
when
therefore
dareios
came
to
the
desert
region
he
ceased
from
his
course
and
halted
his
army
upon
the
river
oaros
having
so
done
he
began
to
build
eight
large
fortifications
at
equal
distances
from
one
another
that
is
to
say
about
sixty
furlongs
of
which
the
ruins
still
existed
down
to
my
time
and
while
he
was
occupied
in
this
the
scythians
whom
he
was
pursuing
came
round
by
the
upper
parts
and
returned
back
to
scythia
accordingly
since
these
had
altogether
disappeared
and
were
no
longer
seen
by
the
persians
at
all
dareios
left
those
fortifications
half
finished
and
turning
back
himself
began
to
go
towards
the
west
supposing
that
these
were
the
whole
body
of
the
scythians
and
that
they
were
flying
towards
the
west
and
marching
his
army
as
quickly
as
possible
when
he
came
to
scythia
he
met
with
the
two
divisions
of
the
scythians
together
and
having
fallen
in
with
these
he
continued
to
pursue
them
while
they
retired
out
of
his
way
one
day
journey
in
advance
and
as
dareios
did
not
cease
to
come
after
them
the
scythians
according
to
the
plan
which
they
had
made
continued
to
retire
before
him
towards
the
land
of
those
who
had
refused
to
give
their
alliance
and
first
towards
that
of
the
melanchlainoi
and
when
scythians
and
persians
both
together
had
invaded
and
disturbed
these
the
scythians
led
the
way
to
the
country
of
the
androphagoi
and
when
these
had
also
been
disturbed
they
proceeded
to
the
land
of
the
neuroi
and
while
these
too
were
being
disturbed
the
scythians
went
on
retiring
before
the
enemy
to
the
agathyrsians
the
agathyrsians
however
seeing
that
their
next
neighbours
also
were
flying
from
the
scythians
and
had
been
disturbed
sent
a
herald
before
the
scythians
invaded
their
land
and
proclaimed
to
the
scythians
not
to
set
foot
upon
their
confines
warning
them
that
if
they
should
attempt
to
invade
the
country
they
would
first
have
to
fight
with
them
the
agathyrsians
then
having
given
this
warning
came
out
in
arms
to
their
borders
meaning
to
drive
off
those
who
were
coming
upon
them
but
the
melanchlainoi
and
androphagoi
and
neuroi
when
the
persians
and
scythians
together
invaded
them
did
not
betake
themselves
to
brave
defence
but
forgot
their
former
threat
and
fled
in
confusion
ever
further
towards
the
north
to
the
desert
region
the
scythians
however
when
the
agathyrsians
had
warned
them
off
did
not
attempt
any
more
to
come
to
these
but
led
the
persians
from
the
country
of
the
neuroi
back
to
their
own
land
now
as
this
went
on
for
a
long
time
and
did
not
cease
dareios
sent
a
horseman
to
idanthyrsos
king
of
the
scythians
and
said
as
follows
thou
most
wondrous
man
why
dost
thou
fly
for
ever
when
thou
mightest
do
of
these
two
things
one
thou
thinkest
thyself
able
to
make
opposition
to
my
power
stand
thou
still
and
cease
from
wandering
abroad
and
fight
but
if
thou
dost
acknowledge
thyself
too
weak
cease
then
in
that
case
also
from
thy
course
and
come
to
speech
with
thy
master
bringing
to
him
gifts
of
earth
and
water
to
this
the
king
of
the
scythians
idanthyrsos
made
answer
thus
my
case
o
persian
stands
thus
yet
did
i
fly
because
i
was
afraid
either
before
this
time
from
any
other
man
or
now
from
thee
nor
have
i
done
anything
different
now
from
that
which
i
was
wont
to
do
also
in
time
of
peace
and
as
to
the
cause
why
i
do
not
fight
with
thee
at
once
this
also
i
will
declare
to
thee
we
have
neither
cities
nor
land
sown
with
crops
about
which
we
should
fear
lest
they
should
be
captured
or
laid
waste
and
so
join
battle
more
speedily
with
you
but
if
it
be
necessary
by
all
means
to
come
to
this
speedily
know
that
we
have
sepulchres
in
which
our
fathers
are
buried
therefore
come
now
find
out
these
and
attempt
to
destroy
them
and
ye
shall
know
then
whether
we
shall
fight
with
you
for
the
sepulchres
or
whether
we
shall
not
fight
before
that
however
unless
the
motion
comes
upon
us
we
shall
not
join
battle
with
thee
about
fighting
let
so
much
as
has
been
said
suffice
but
as
to
masters
i
acknowledge
none
over
me
but
zeus
my
ancestor
and
hestia
the
queen
of
the
scythians
to
thee
then
in
place
of
gifts
of
earth
and
water
i
shall
send
such
things
as
it
is
fitting
that
thou
shouldest
receive
and
in
return
for
thy
saying
that
thou
art
my
master
for
that
i
say
woe
betide
thee
this
is
the
proverbial
saying
of
the
scythians
the
herald
then
had
departed
to
report
this
to
dareios
and
the
kings
of
the
scythians
having
heard
mention
of
subjection
to
a
master
were
filled
with
wrath
they
sent
accordingly
the
division
which
was
appointed
to
be
joined
with
the
sauromatai
that
division
of
which
scopasis
was
in
command
bidding
them
come
to
speech
with
the
ionians
namely
those
who
were
guarding
the
bridge
of
the
ister
and
meanwhile
they
who
were
left
behind
resolved
not
to
lead
the
persians
wandering
about
any
more
but
to
attack
them
constantly
as
they
were
getting
provisions
therefore
they
observed
the
soldiers
of
dareios
as
they
got
provisions
and
did
that
which
they
had
determined
and
the
cavalry
of
the
scythians
always
routed
that
of
the
enemy
but
the
persian
horsemen
as
they
fled
fell
back
upon
the
men
on
foot
and
these
would
come
up
to
their
assistance
and
meanwhile
the
scythians
when
they
had
driven
in
the
cavalry
turned
back
fearing
the
men
on
foot
also
by
night
the
scythians
used
to
make
similar
attacks
and
the
thing
which
strange
to
say
most
helped
the
persians
and
hindered
the
scythians
in
their
attacks
upon
the
camp
of
dareios
i
will
mention
namely
the
voice
of
the
asses
and
the
appearance
of
the
mules
for
scythia
produces
neither
ass
nor
mule
as
i
have
declared
before
nor
is
there
at
all
in
the
scythian
country
either
ass
or
mule
on
account
of
the
cold
the
asses
accordingly
by
riotously
braying
used
to
throw
into
confusion
the
cavalry
of
the
scythians
and
often
as
they
were
in
the
middle
of
riding
against
the
persians
when
the
horses
heard
the
voice
of
the
asses
they
turned
back
in
confusion
and
were
possessed
with
wonder
pricking
up
their
ears
because
they
had
never
heard
such
a
voice
nor
seen
the
form
of
the
creature
before
so
far
then
the
persians
had
the
advantage
for
a
small
part
of
the
war
but
the
scythians
whenever
they
saw
that
the
persians
were
disquieted
then
in
order
that
they
might
remain
a
longer
time
in
scythia
and
in
remaining
might
suffer
by
being
in
want
of
everything
would
leave
some
of
their
own
cattle
behind
with
the
herdsmen
while
they
themselves
rode
out
of
the
way
to
another
place
and
the
persians
would
come
upon
the
cattle
and
take
them
and
having
taken
them
they
were
elated
at
what
they
had
done
as
this
happened
often
at
length
dareios
began
to
be
in
straits
and
the
kings
of
the
scythians
perceiving
this
sent
a
herald
bearing
as
gifts
to
dareios
a
bird
and
a
mouse
and
a
frog
and
five
arrows
the
persians
accordingly
asked
the
bearer
of
the
gifts
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
gifts
which
were
offered
but
he
said
that
nothing
more
had
been
commanded
to
him
but
to
give
them
and
get
away
as
speedily
as
possible
and
he
bade
the
persians
find
out
for
themselves
if
they
had
wisdom
that
which
the
gifts
were
meant
to
express
having
heard
this
the
persians
took
counsel
with
one
another
and
the
opinion
of
dareios
was
that
the
scythians
were
giving
to
him
both
themselves
and
also
earth
and
water
making
his
conjecture
by
this
namely
that
a
mouse
is
produced
in
the
earth
and
feeds
on
the
same
produce
of
the
earth
as
man
and
a
frog
in
the
water
while
a
bird
has
great
resemblance
to
a
horse
and
moreover
that
in
giving
the
arrows
they
were
delivering
up
their
own
might
in
battle
this
was
the
opinion
expressed
by
dareios
but
the
opinion
of
gobryas
one
of
the
seven
men
who
killed
the
magian
was
at
variance
with
it
for
he
conjectured
that
the
gifts
expressed
this
unless
ye
become
birds
and
fly
up
into
the
heaven
o
persians
or
become
mice
and
sink
down
under
the
earth
or
become
frogs
and
leap
into
the
lakes
ye
shall
not
return
back
home
but
shall
be
smitten
by
these
arrows
the
persians
then
i
say
were
making
conjecture
of
the
gifts
and
meanwhile
the
single
division
of
the
scythians
that
which
had
been
appointed
at
first
to
keep
guard
along
the
maiotian
lake
and
then
to
go
to
the
ister
and
come
to
speech
with
the
ionians
when
they
arrived
at
the
bridge
spoke
as
follows
ionians
we
have
come
bringing
you
freedom
if
at
least
ye
are
willing
to
listen
to
us
for
we
are
informed
that
dareios
gave
you
command
to
guard
the
bridge
for
sixty
days
only
and
then
if
he
had
not
arrived
within
that
time
to
get
you
away
to
your
own
land
now
therefore
if
ye
do
as
we
say
ye
will
be
without
blame
from
his
part
and
without
blame
also
from
ours
stay
the
appointed
days
and
then
after
that
get
you
away
they
then
when
the
ionians
had
engaged
themselves
to
do
this
hastened
back
again
by
the
quickest
way
and
meanwhile
after
the
coming
of
the
gifts
to
dareios
the
scythians
who
were
left
had
arrayed
themselves
against
the
persians
with
both
foot
and
horse
meaning
to
engage
battle
now
when
the
scythians
had
been
placed
in
a
hare
darted
through
them
into
the
space
between
the
two
armies
and
each
company
of
them
as
they
saw
the
hare
began
to
run
after
it
when
the
scythians
were
thus
thrown
into
disorder
and
were
raising
loud
cries
dareios
asked
what
was
this
clamour
arising
from
the
enemy
and
hearing
that
they
were
running
after
the
hare
he
said
to
those
men
to
whom
he
was
wont
to
say
things
at
other
times
these
men
have
very
slight
regard
for
us
and
i
perceive
now
that
gobryas
spoke
rightly
about
the
scythian
gifts
seeing
then
that
now
i
myself
too
think
that
things
are
so
we
have
need
of
good
counsel
in
order
that
our
retreat
homewards
may
be
safely
made
to
this
replied
gobryas
and
said
o
king
even
by
report
i
was
almost
assured
of
the
difficulty
of
dealing
with
these
men
and
when
i
came
i
learnt
it
still
more
thoroughly
since
i
saw
that
they
were
mocking
us
now
therefore
my
opinion
is
that
as
soon
as
night
comes
on
we
kindle
the
as
we
are
wont
to
do
at
other
times
also
and
deceive
with
a
false
tale
those
of
our
men
who
are
weakest
to
endure
hardships
and
tie
up
all
the
asses
and
get
us
away
before
either
the
scythians
make
for
the
ister
to
destroy
the
bridge
or
something
be
resolved
by
the
ionians
which
may
be
our
ruin
thus
gobryas
advised
and
after
this
when
night
came
on
dareios
acted
on
this
opinion
those
of
his
men
who
were
weakened
by
fatigue
and
whose
loss
was
of
least
account
these
he
left
behind
in
the
camp
and
the
asses
also
tied
up
and
for
the
following
reasons
he
left
behind
the
asses
and
the
weaker
men
of
his
army
asses
in
order
that
they
might
make
a
noise
which
should
be
heard
and
the
men
really
because
of
their
weakness
but
on
a
pretence
stated
openly
that
he
was
about
to
attack
the
scythians
with
the
effective
part
of
the
army
and
that
they
meanwhile
were
to
be
defenders
of
the
camp
having
thus
instructed
those
who
were
left
behind
and
having
kindled
dareios
hastened
by
the
quickest
way
towards
the
ister
and
the
asses
having
no
longer
about
them
the
usual
throng
very
much
more
for
that
reason
caused
their
voice
to
be
heard
so
the
scythians
hearing
the
asses
supposed
surely
that
the
persians
were
remaining
in
their
former
place
but
when
it
was
day
those
who
were
left
behind
perceived
that
they
had
been
betrayed
by
dareios
and
they
held
out
their
hands
in
submission
to
the
scythians
telling
them
what
their
case
was
and
the
scythians
when
they
heard
this
joined
together
as
quickly
as
possible
that
is
to
say
the
two
combined
divisions
of
the
scythians
and
the
single
division
and
also
the
sauromatai
budinoi
and
gelonians
and
began
to
pursue
the
persians
making
straight
for
the
ister
but
as
the
persian
army
for
the
most
part
consisted
of
men
on
foot
and
was
not
acquainted
with
the
roads
the
roads
not
being
marked
with
tracks
while
the
scythian
army
consisted
of
horsemen
and
was
acquainted
with
the
shortest
cuts
along
the
way
they
missed
one
another
and
the
scythians
arrived
at
the
bridge
much
before
the
persians
then
having
learnt
that
the
persians
had
not
yet
arrived
they
said
to
the
ionians
who
were
in
the
ships
ionians
the
days
of
your
number
are
past
and
ye
are
not
acting
uprightly
in
that
ye
yet
remain
waiting
but
as
ye
stayed
before
from
fear
so
now
break
up
the
passage
as
quickly
as
ye
may
and
depart
free
and
unhurt
feeling
thankfulness
both
to
the
gods
and
to
the
scythians
and
him
who
was
formerly
your
master
we
will
so
convince
that
he
shall
never
again
march
with
an
army
upon
any
nation
upon
this
the
ionians
took
counsel
together
and
miltiades
the
athenian
on
the
one
hand
who
was
commander
and
despot
of
the
men
of
the
chersonese
in
hellespont
was
of
opinion
that
they
should
follow
the
advice
of
the
scythians
and
set
ionia
free
but
histiaios
the
milesian
was
of
the
opposite
opinion
to
this
for
he
said
that
at
the
present
time
it
was
by
means
of
dareios
that
each
one
of
them
was
ruling
as
despot
over
a
city
and
if
the
power
of
dareios
should
be
destroyed
neither
he
himself
would
be
able
to
bear
rule
over
the
milesians
nor
would
any
other
of
them
be
able
to
bear
rule
over
any
other
city
for
each
of
the
cities
would
choose
to
have
popular
rather
than
despotic
rule
when
histiaios
declared
his
opinion
thus
forthwith
all
turned
to
this
opinion
whereas
at
the
first
they
were
adopting
that
of
miltiades
now
these
were
they
who
gave
the
vote
between
the
two
opinions
and
were
men
of
consequence
in
the
eyes
of
the
king
the
despots
of
the
hellespontians
daphnis
of
abydos
hippoclos
of
lampsacos
herophantos
of
parion
metrodoros
of
proconnesos
aristagoras
of
kyzicos
and
ariston
of
byzantion
these
were
those
from
the
hellespont
and
from
ionia
strattis
of
chios
aiakes
of
samos
laodamas
of
phocaia
and
histiaios
of
miletos
whose
opinion
had
been
proposed
in
opposition
to
that
of
miltiades
and
of
the
aiolians
the
only
man
of
consequence
there
present
was
aristagoras
of
kyme
when
these
adopted
the
opinion
of
histiaios
they
resolved
to
add
to
it
deeds
and
words
as
follows
namely
to
break
up
that
part
of
the
bridge
which
was
on
the
side
towards
the
scythians
to
break
it
up
i
say
for
a
distance
equal
to
the
range
of
an
arrow
both
in
order
that
they
might
be
thought
to
be
doing
something
though
in
fact
they
were
doing
nothing
and
for
fear
that
the
scythians
might
make
an
attempt
using
force
and
desiring
to
cross
the
ister
by
the
bridge
and
in
breaking
up
that
part
of
the
bridge
which
was
towards
scythia
they
resolved
to
say
that
they
would
do
all
that
which
the
scythians
desired
this
they
added
to
the
opinion
proposed
and
then
histiaios
coming
forth
from
among
them
made
answer
to
the
scythians
as
follows
scythians
ye
are
come
bringing
good
news
and
it
is
a
timely
haste
that
ye
make
to
bring
it
and
ye
on
your
part
give
us
good
guidance
while
we
on
ours
render
to
you
suitable
service
for
as
ye
see
we
are
breaking
up
the
passage
and
we
shall
show
all
zeal
in
our
desire
to
be
free
and
while
we
are
breaking
up
the
bridge
it
is
fitting
that
ye
should
be
seeking
for
those
of
whom
ye
speak
and
when
ye
have
found
them
that
ye
should
take
vengeance
on
them
on
behalf
of
us
as
well
as
of
yourselves
in
such
manner
as
they
deserve
the
scythians
then
believing
for
the
second
time
that
the
ionians
were
speaking
the
truth
turned
back
to
make
search
for
the
persians
but
they
missed
altogether
their
line
of
march
through
the
land
of
this
the
scythians
themselves
were
the
cause
since
they
had
destroyed
the
pastures
for
horses
in
that
region
and
had
choked
up
with
earth
the
springs
of
water
for
if
they
had
not
done
this
it
would
have
been
possible
for
them
easily
if
they
desired
it
to
discover
the
persians
but
as
it
was
by
those
things
wherein
they
thought
they
had
taken
their
measures
best
they
failed
of
success
the
scythians
then
on
their
part
were
passing
through
those
regions
of
their
own
land
where
there
was
grass
for
the
horses
and
springs
of
water
and
were
seeking
for
the
enemy
there
thinking
that
they
too
were
taking
a
course
in
their
retreat
through
such
country
as
this
while
the
persians
in
fact
marched
keeping
carefully
to
the
track
which
they
had
made
before
and
so
they
found
the
passage
of
the
river
though
with
difficulty
and
as
they
arrived
by
night
and
found
the
bridge
broken
up
they
were
brought
to
the
extreme
of
fear
lest
the
ionians
should
have
deserted
them
now
there
was
with
dareios
an
egyptian
who
had
a
voice
louder
than
that
of
any
other
man
on
earth
and
this
man
dareios
ordered
to
take
his
stand
upon
the
bank
of
the
ister
and
to
call
histiaios
of
miletos
he
accordingly
proceeded
to
do
so
and
histiaios
hearing
the
first
hail
produced
all
the
ships
to
carry
the
army
over
and
also
put
together
the
bridge
thus
the
persians
escaped
and
the
scythians
in
their
search
missed
the
persians
the
second
time
also
and
their
judgment
of
the
ionians
is
that
on
the
one
hand
if
they
be
regarded
as
free
men
they
are
the
most
worthless
and
cowardly
of
all
men
but
on
the
other
hand
if
regarded
as
slaves
they
are
the
most
attached
to
their
master
and
the
least
disposed
to
run
away
of
all
slaves
this
is
the
reproach
which
is
cast
against
the
ionians
by
the
scythians
dareios
then
marching
through
thrace
arrived
at
sestos
in
the
chersonese
and
from
that
place
he
passed
over
himself
in
his
ships
to
asia
but
to
command
his
army
in
europe
he
left
megabazos
a
persian
to
whom
dareios
once
gave
honour
by
uttering
in
the
land
of
persia
this
saying
was
beginning
to
eat
pomegranates
and
at
once
when
he
opened
the
first
of
them
artabanos
his
brother
asked
him
of
what
he
would
desire
to
have
as
many
as
there
were
seeds
in
the
pomegranate
and
dareios
said
that
he
would
desire
to
have
men
like
megabazos
as
many
as
that
in
number
rather
than
to
have
hellas
subject
to
him
in
persia
i
say
he
honoured
him
by
saying
these
words
and
at
this
time
he
left
him
in
command
with
eight
myriads
of
his
army
this
megabazos
uttered
one
saying
whereby
he
left
of
himself
an
imperishable
memory
with
the
peoples
of
hellespont
for
being
once
at
byzantion
he
heard
that
the
men
of
calchedon
had
settled
in
that
region
seventeen
years
before
the
byzantians
and
having
heard
it
he
said
that
those
of
calchedon
at
that
time
chanced
to
be
blind
for
assuredly
they
would
not
have
chosen
the
worse
place
when
they
might
have
settled
in
that
which
was
better
if
they
had
not
been
blind
this
megabazos
it
was
who
was
left
in
command
at
that
time
in
the
land
of
the
hellespontians
and
he
proceeded
to
subdue
all
who
did
not
take
the
side
of
the
medes
he
then
was
doing
thus
and
at
this
very
same
time
a
great
expedition
was
being
made
also
against
libya
on
an
occasion
which
i
shall
relate
when
i
have
first
related
this
which
children
children
of
those
who
voyaged
in
the
argo
having
been
driven
forth
by
those
pelasgians
who
carried
away
at
brauron
the
women
of
the
athenians
been
driven
forth
i
say
by
these
from
lemnos
had
departed
and
sailed
to
lacedemon
and
sitting
down
on
mount
taÿgetos
they
kindled
a
fire
the
lacedemonians
seeing
this
sent
a
messenger
to
inquire
who
they
were
and
from
whence
and
they
answered
the
question
of
the
messenger
saying
that
they
were
minyai
and
children
of
heroes
who
sailed
in
the
argo
for
these
they
said
had
put
in
to
lemnos
and
propagated
the
race
of
which
they
sprang
the
lacedemonians
having
heard
the
story
of
the
descent
of
the
minyai
sent
a
second
time
and
asked
for
what
purpose
they
had
come
into
the
country
and
were
causing
a
fire
to
blaze
they
said
that
they
had
been
cast
out
by
the
pelasgians
and
were
come
now
to
the
land
of
their
fathers
for
most
just
it
was
that
this
should
so
be
done
and
they
said
that
their
request
was
to
be
permitted
to
dwell
with
these
having
a
share
of
civil
rights
and
a
portion
allotted
to
them
of
the
land
and
the
lacedemonians
were
content
to
receive
the
minyai
upon
the
terms
which
they
themselves
desired
being
most
of
all
impelled
to
do
this
by
the
fact
that
the
sons
of
tyndareus
were
voyagers
in
the
argo
so
having
received
the
minyai
they
gave
them
a
share
of
land
and
distributed
them
in
the
tribes
and
they
forthwith
made
marriages
and
gave
in
marriage
to
others
the
women
whom
they
brought
with
them
from
lemnos
however
when
no
very
long
time
had
passed
the
minyai
forthwith
broke
out
into
insolence
asking
for
a
share
of
the
royal
power
and
also
doing
other
impious
things
therefore
the
lacedemonians
resolved
to
put
them
to
death
and
having
seized
them
they
cast
them
into
a
prison
now
the
lacedemonians
put
to
death
by
night
all
those
whom
they
put
to
death
but
no
man
by
day
when
therefore
they
were
just
about
to
kill
them
the
wives
of
the
minyai
being
native
spartans
and
daughters
of
the
first
citizens
of
sparta
entreated
to
be
allowed
to
enter
the
prison
and
come
to
speech
every
one
with
her
own
husband
and
they
let
them
pass
in
not
supposing
that
any
craft
would
be
practised
by
them
they
however
when
they
had
entered
delivered
to
their
husbands
all
the
garments
which
they
were
wearing
and
themselves
received
those
of
their
husbands
thus
the
minyai
having
put
on
the
women
clothes
went
forth
out
of
prison
as
women
and
having
escaped
in
this
manner
they
went
again
to
taÿgetos
and
sat
down
there
now
at
this
very
same
time
theras
the
son
of
autesion
the
son
of
tisamenos
the
son
of
thersander
the
son
of
polyneikes
was
preparing
to
set
forth
from
lacedemon
to
found
a
settlement
this
theras
who
was
of
the
race
of
cadmos
was
mother
brother
to
the
sons
of
aristodemos
eurysthenes
and
procles
and
while
these
sons
were
yet
children
theras
as
their
guardian
held
the
royal
power
in
sparta
when
however
his
nephews
were
grown
and
had
taken
the
power
into
their
hands
then
theras
being
grieved
that
he
should
be
ruled
by
others
after
he
had
tasted
of
rule
himself
said
that
he
would
not
remain
in
lacedemon
but
would
sail
away
to
his
kinsmen
now
there
were
in
the
island
which
is
now
called
thera
but
formerly
was
called
callista
descendants
of
membliaros
the
son
of
poikiles
a
phenician
for
cadmos
the
son
of
agenor
in
his
search
for
europa
put
in
to
land
at
the
island
which
is
now
called
thera
and
whether
it
was
that
the
country
pleased
him
when
he
had
put
to
land
or
whether
he
chose
to
do
so
for
any
other
reason
he
left
in
this
island
besides
other
phenicians
membliaros
also
of
his
own
kinsmen
these
occupied
the
island
called
callista
for
eight
generations
of
men
before
theras
came
from
lacedemon
to
these
then
i
say
theras
was
preparing
to
set
forth
taking
with
him
people
from
the
tribes
and
intending
to
settle
together
with
those
who
have
been
mentioned
not
with
any
design
to
drive
them
out
but
on
the
contrary
claiming
them
very
strongly
as
kinfolk
and
when
the
minyai
after
having
escaped
from
the
prison
went
and
sat
down
on
taÿgetos
theras
entreated
of
the
lacedemonians
as
they
were
proposing
to
put
them
to
death
that
no
slaughter
might
take
place
and
at
the
same
time
he
engaged
himself
to
take
them
forth
out
of
the
land
the
lacedemonians
having
agreed
to
this
proposal
he
sailed
away
with
three
galleys
to
the
descendants
of
membliaros
not
taking
with
him
by
any
means
all
the
minyai
but
a
few
only
for
the
greater
number
of
them
turned
towards
the
land
of
the
paroreatai
and
caucones
and
having
driven
these
out
of
their
country
they
parted
themselves
into
six
divisions
and
founded
in
their
territory
the
following
towns
makistos
phrixai
pyrgos
epion
nudion
of
these
the
eleians
sacked
the
greater
number
within
my
own
lifetime
the
island
meanwhile
got
its
name
of
thera
after
theras
who
led
the
settlement
and
since
his
son
said
that
he
would
not
sail
with
him
therefore
he
said
that
he
would
leave
him
behind
as
a
sheep
among
wolves
and
in
accordance
with
that
saying
this
young
man
got
the
name
of
oiolycos
and
it
chanced
that
this
name
prevailed
over
his
former
name
then
from
oiolycos
was
begotten
aigeus
after
whom
are
called
the
aigeidai
a
powerful
clan
in
sparta
and
the
men
of
this
tribe
since
their
children
did
not
live
to
grow
up
established
by
the
suggestion
of
an
oracle
a
temple
to
the
avenging
deities
of
laïos
and
oedipus
and
after
this
the
same
thing
was
continued
in
thera
by
the
descendants
of
these
men
up
to
this
point
of
the
story
the
lacedemonians
agree
in
their
report
with
the
men
of
thera
but
in
what
is
to
come
it
is
those
of
thera
alone
who
report
that
it
happened
as
follows
grinnos
the
son
of
aisanios
a
descendant
of
the
theras
who
has
been
mentioned
and
king
of
the
island
of
thera
came
to
delphi
bringing
the
offering
of
a
hecatomb
from
his
state
and
there
were
accompanying
him
besides
others
of
the
citizens
also
battos
the
son
of
polymnestos
who
was
by
descent
of
the
family
of
euphemos
of
the
race
of
the
minyai
now
when
grinnos
the
king
of
the
theraians
was
consulting
the
oracle
about
other
matters
the
pythian
prophetess
gave
answer
bidding
him
found
a
city
in
libya
and
he
made
reply
saying
lord
i
am
by
this
time
somewhat
old
and
heavy
to
stir
but
do
thou
bid
some
one
of
these
younger
ones
do
this
as
he
thus
said
he
pointed
towards
battos
so
far
at
that
time
but
afterwards
when
he
had
come
away
they
were
in
difficulty
about
the
saying
of
the
oracle
neither
having
any
knowledge
of
libya
in
what
part
of
the
earth
it
was
nor
venturing
to
send
a
colony
to
the
unknown
then
after
this
for
seven
years
there
was
no
rain
in
thera
and
in
these
years
all
the
trees
in
their
island
were
withered
up
excepting
one
and
when
the
theraians
consulted
the
oracle
the
pythian
prophetess
alleged
this
matter
of
colonising
libya
to
be
the
cause
as
then
they
had
no
remedy
for
their
evil
they
sent
messengers
to
crete
to
find
out
whether
any
of
the
cretans
or
of
the
sojourners
in
crete
had
ever
come
to
libya
these
as
they
wandered
round
about
the
country
came
also
the
city
of
itanos
and
there
they
met
with
a
fisher
for
purple
named
corobios
who
said
that
he
had
been
carried
away
by
winds
and
had
come
to
libya
and
in
libya
to
the
island
of
platea
this
man
they
persuaded
by
payment
of
money
and
took
him
to
thera
and
from
thera
there
set
sail
men
to
explore
at
first
not
many
in
number
and
corobios
having
guided
them
to
this
same
island
of
platea
they
left
corobios
there
leaving
behind
with
him
provisions
for
a
certain
number
of
months
and
sailed
themselves
as
quickly
as
possible
to
make
report
about
the
island
to
the
men
of
thera
since
however
these
stayed
away
longer
than
the
time
appointed
corobios
found
himself
destitute
and
after
this
a
ship
of
samos
of
which
the
master
was
colaios
while
sailing
to
egypt
was
carried
out
of
its
course
and
came
to
this
island
of
platea
and
the
samians
hearing
from
corobios
the
whole
story
left
him
provisions
for
a
year
they
themselves
then
put
out
to
sea
from
the
island
and
sailed
on
endeavouring
to
reach
egypt
but
carried
away
continually
by
the
east
wind
and
as
the
wind
did
not
cease
to
blow
they
passed
through
the
pillars
of
heracles
and
came
to
tartessos
guided
by
divine
providence
now
this
was
at
that
time
untouched
by
any
so
that
when
these
returned
back
home
they
made
profit
from
their
cargo
greater
than
any
other
hellenes
of
whom
we
have
certain
knowledge
with
the
exception
at
least
of
sostratos
the
son
of
laodamas
the
eginetan
for
with
him
it
is
not
possible
for
any
other
man
to
contend
and
the
samians
set
apart
six
talents
the
tenth
part
of
their
gains
and
had
a
bronze
vessel
made
like
an
argolic
with
round
it
heads
of
griffins
projecting
in
a
row
and
this
they
dedicated
as
an
offering
in
the
temple
of
hera
setting
as
supports
under
it
three
colossal
statues
of
bronze
seven
cubits
in
height
resting
upon
their
knees
by
reason
first
of
this
deed
great
friendship
was
formed
by
those
of
kyrene
and
thera
with
the
samians
the
theraians
meanwhile
when
they
arrived
at
thera
after
having
left
corobios
in
the
island
reported
that
they
had
colonised
an
island
on
the
coast
of
libya
and
the
men
of
thera
resolved
to
send
one
of
every
two
brothers
selected
by
lot
and
men
besides
taken
from
all
the
regions
of
the
island
which
are
seven
in
number
and
further
that
battos
should
be
both
their
leader
and
their
king
thus
then
they
sent
forth
two
galleys
to
platea
this
is
the
report
of
the
theraians
and
for
the
remainder
of
the
account
from
this
point
onwards
the
theraians
are
in
agreement
with
the
men
of
kyrene
from
this
point
onwards
i
say
since
in
what
concerns
battos
the
kyrenians
tell
by
no
means
the
same
tale
as
those
of
thera
for
their
account
is
this
is
in
crete
a
city
called
oäxos
in
which
one
etearchos
became
king
who
when
he
had
a
daughter
whose
mother
was
dead
named
phronime
took
to
wife
another
woman
notwithstanding
she
having
come
in
afterwards
thought
fit
to
be
a
stepmother
to
phronime
in
deed
as
well
as
in
name
giving
her
evil
treatment
and
devising
everything
possible
to
her
hurt
and
at
last
she
brings
against
her
a
charge
of
lewdness
and
persuades
her
husband
that
the
truth
is
so
he
then
being
convinced
by
his
wife
devised
an
unholy
deed
against
the
daughter
for
there
was
in
oäxos
one
themison
a
merchant
of
thera
whom
etearchos
took
to
himself
as
a
and
caused
him
to
swear
that
he
would
surely
serve
him
in
whatsoever
he
should
require
and
when
he
had
caused
him
to
swear
this
he
brought
and
delivered
to
him
his
daughter
and
bade
him
take
her
away
and
cast
her
into
the
sea
themison
then
was
very
greatly
vexed
at
the
deceit
practised
in
the
matter
of
the
oath
and
he
dissolved
his
and
did
as
follows
that
is
to
say
he
received
the
girl
and
sailed
away
and
when
he
got
out
into
the
open
sea
to
free
himself
from
blame
as
regards
the
oath
which
etearchos
had
made
him
swear
he
tied
her
on
each
side
with
ropes
and
let
her
down
into
the
sea
and
then
drew
her
up
and
came
to
thera
after
that
polymnestos
a
man
of
repute
among
the
theraians
received
phronime
from
him
and
kept
her
as
his
concubine
and
in
course
of
time
there
was
born
to
him
from
her
a
son
with
an
impediment
in
his
voice
and
lisping
to
whom
as
both
theraians
and
kyrenians
say
was
given
the
name
battos
but
i
think
that
some
other
name
was
then
given
and
he
was
named
battos
instead
of
this
after
he
came
to
libya
taking
for
himself
this
surname
from
the
oracle
which
was
given
to
him
at
delphi
and
from
the
rank
which
he
had
obtained
for
the
libyans
call
a
king
battos
and
for
this
reason
i
think
the
pythian
prophetess
in
her
prophesying
called
him
so
using
the
libyan
tongue
because
she
knew
that
he
would
be
a
king
in
libya
for
when
he
had
grown
to
be
a
man
he
came
to
delphi
to
inquire
about
his
voice
and
when
he
asked
the
prophetess
thus
answered
him
for
a
voice
thou
camest
o
battos
but
thee
lord
phoebus
apollo
sendeth
as
settler
forth
to
the
libyan
land
just
as
if
she
should
say
using
the
hellenic
tongue
for
a
voice
thou
camest
o
king
he
thus
made
answer
lord
i
came
to
thee
to
inquire
concerning
my
voice
but
thou
answerest
me
other
things
which
are
not
possible
bidding
me
go
as
a
settler
to
libya
but
with
what
power
or
with
what
force
of
men
should
i
go
thus
saying
he
did
not
at
all
persuade
her
to
give
him
any
other
reply
and
as
she
was
prophesying
to
him
again
the
same
things
as
before
battos
departed
while
she
was
yet
speaking
and
went
away
to
thera
after
this
there
came
evil
fortune
both
to
himself
and
to
the
other
men
of
thera
and
the
theraians
not
understanding
that
which
befell
them
sent
to
delphi
to
inquire
about
the
evils
which
they
were
suffering
and
the
pythian
prophetess
gave
them
reply
that
if
they
joined
with
battos
in
founding
kyrene
in
libya
they
would
fare
the
better
after
this
the
theraians
sent
battos
with
two
galleys
and
these
sailed
to
libya
and
then
came
away
back
to
thera
for
they
did
not
know
what
else
to
do
and
the
theraians
pelted
them
with
missiles
when
they
endeavoured
to
land
and
would
not
allow
them
to
put
to
shore
but
bade
them
sail
back
again
they
accordingly
being
compelled
sailed
away
back
and
they
made
a
settlement
in
an
island
lying
near
the
coast
of
libya
called
as
was
said
before
platea
this
island
is
said
to
be
of
the
same
size
as
the
now
existing
city
of
kyrene
in
this
they
continued
to
dwell
two
years
but
as
they
had
no
prosperity
they
left
one
of
their
number
behind
and
all
the
rest
sailed
away
to
delphi
and
having
come
to
the
oracle
they
consulted
it
saying
that
they
were
dwelling
in
libya
and
that
though
they
were
dwelling
there
they
fared
none
the
better
and
the
pythian
prophetess
made
answer
to
them
thus
better
than
i
if
thou
knowest
the
libyan
land
not
having
been
there
than
i
who
have
been
at
thy
wisdom
i
wonder
having
heard
this
battos
and
his
companions
sailed
away
back
again
for
in
fact
the
god
would
not
let
them
off
from
the
task
of
settlement
till
they
had
come
to
libya
itself
and
having
arrived
at
the
island
and
taken
up
him
whom
they
had
left
they
made
a
settlement
in
libya
itself
at
a
spot
opposite
the
island
called
aziris
which
is
enclosed
by
most
fair
woods
on
both
sides
and
a
river
flows
by
it
on
one
side
in
this
spot
they
dwelt
for
six
years
and
in
the
seventh
year
the
libyans
persuaded
them
to
leave
it
making
request
and
saying
that
they
would
conduct
them
to
a
better
region
so
the
libyans
led
them
from
that
place
making
them
start
towards
evening
and
in
order
that
the
hellenes
might
not
see
the
fairest
of
all
the
regions
as
they
passed
through
it
they
led
them
past
it
by
night
having
calculated
the
time
of
daylight
and
this
region
is
called
irasa
then
having
conducted
them
to
the
spring
of
apollo
they
said
hellenes
here
is
a
fit
place
for
you
to
dwell
for
here
the
heaven
is
pierced
with
holes
now
during
the
lifetime
of
the
first
settler
battos
who
reigned
forty
years
and
of
his
son
arkesilaos
who
reigned
sixteen
years
the
kyrenians
continued
to
dwell
there
with
the
same
number
as
when
they
first
set
forth
to
the
colony
but
in
the
time
of
the
third
king
called
battos
the
prosperous
the
pythian
prophetess
gave
an
oracle
wherein
she
urged
the
hellenes
in
general
to
sail
and
join
with
the
kyrenians
in
colonising
libya
for
the
kyrenians
invited
them
giving
promise
of
a
division
of
land
and
the
oracle
which
she
uttered
was
as
follows
who
to
the
land
much
desirèd
to
libya
afterwards
cometh
after
the
land
be
divided
i
say
he
shall
some
day
repent
it
then
great
numbers
were
gathered
at
kyrene
and
the
libyans
who
dwelt
round
had
much
land
cut
off
from
their
possessions
therefore
they
with
their
king
whose
name
was
adicran
as
they
were
not
only
deprived
of
their
country
but
also
were
dealt
with
very
insolently
by
the
kyrenians
sent
to
egypt
and
delivered
themselves
over
to
apries
king
of
egypt
he
then
having
gathered
a
great
army
of
egyptians
sent
it
against
kyrene
and
the
men
of
kyrene
marched
out
to
the
region
of
irasa
and
to
the
spring
theste
and
there
both
joined
battle
with
the
egyptians
and
defeated
them
in
the
battle
for
since
the
egyptians
had
not
before
made
trial
of
the
hellenes
in
fight
and
therefore
despised
them
they
were
so
slaughtered
that
but
few
of
them
returned
back
to
egypt
in
consequence
of
this
and
because
they
laid
the
blame
of
it
upon
apries
the
egyptians
revolted
from
him
this
battos
had
a
son
called
arkesilaos
who
first
when
he
became
king
made
a
quarrel
with
his
own
brothers
until
they
finally
departed
to
another
region
of
libya
and
making
the
venture
for
themselves
founded
that
city
which
was
then
and
is
now
called
barca
and
at
the
same
time
as
they
founded
this
they
induced
the
libyans
to
revolt
from
the
kyrenians
after
this
arkesilaos
made
an
expedition
against
those
libyans
who
had
received
them
and
who
had
also
revolted
from
kyrene
and
the
libyans
fearing
him
departed
and
fled
towards
the
eastern
tribes
of
libyans
and
arkesilaos
followed
after
them
as
they
fled
until
he
arrived
in
his
pursuit
at
leucon
in
libya
and
there
the
libyans
resolved
to
attack
him
accordingly
they
engaged
battle
and
defeated
the
kyrenians
so
utterly
that
seven
thousand
hoplites
of
the
kyrenians
fell
there
after
this
disaster
arkesilaos
being
sick
and
having
swallowed
a
potion
was
strangled
by
his
brother
haliarchos
and
haliarchos
was
killed
treacherously
by
the
wife
of
arkesilaos
whose
name
was
eryxo
then
battos
the
son
of
arkesilaos
succeeded
to
the
kingdom
who
was
lame
and
not
sound
in
his
feet
and
the
kyrenians
with
a
view
to
the
misfortune
which
had
befallen
them
sent
men
to
delphi
to
ask
what
form
of
rule
they
should
adopt
in
order
to
live
in
the
best
way
possible
and
the
pythian
prophetess
bade
them
take
to
themselves
a
reformer
of
their
state
from
mantineia
of
the
arcadians
the
men
of
kyrene
accordingly
made
request
and
those
of
mantineia
gave
them
the
man
of
most
repute
among
their
citizens
whose
name
was
demonax
this
man
therefore
having
come
to
kyrene
and
having
ascertained
all
things
exactly
in
the
first
place
caused
them
to
have
three
tribes
distributing
them
thus
division
he
made
of
the
theraians
and
their
dependants
another
of
the
peloponnesians
and
cretans
and
a
third
of
all
the
islanders
then
secondly
for
the
king
battos
he
set
apart
domains
of
land
and
priesthoods
but
all
the
other
powers
which
the
kings
used
to
possess
before
he
assigned
as
of
public
right
to
the
people
during
the
reign
of
this
battos
things
continued
to
be
thus
but
in
the
reign
of
his
son
arkesilaos
there
arose
much
disturbance
about
the
offices
of
the
state
for
arkesilaos
son
of
battos
the
lame
and
of
pheretime
said
that
he
would
not
suffer
it
to
be
according
as
the
mantineian
demonax
had
arranged
but
asked
to
have
back
the
royal
rights
of
his
forefathers
after
this
stirring
up
strife
he
was
worsted
and
went
as
an
exile
to
samos
and
his
mother
to
salamis
in
cyprus
now
at
that
time
the
ruler
of
salamis
was
euelthon
the
same
who
dedicated
as
an
offering
the
censer
at
delphi
a
work
well
worth
seeing
which
is
placed
in
the
treasury
of
the
corinthians
to
him
having
come
pheretime
asked
him
for
an
army
to
restore
herself
and
her
son
to
kyrene
euelthon
however
was
ready
to
give
her
anything
else
rather
than
that
and
she
when
she
received
that
which
he
gave
her
said
that
this
too
was
a
fair
gift
but
fairer
still
would
be
that
other
gift
of
an
army
for
which
she
was
asking
as
she
kept
saying
this
to
every
thing
which
was
given
at
last
euelthon
sent
out
to
her
a
present
of
a
golden
spindle
and
distaff
with
wool
also
upon
it
and
when
pheretime
uttered
again
the
same
saying
about
this
present
euelthon
said
that
such
things
as
this
were
given
as
gifts
to
women
and
not
an
army
arkesilaos
meanwhile
being
in
samos
was
gathering
every
one
together
by
a
promise
of
dividing
land
and
while
a
great
host
was
being
collected
arkesilaos
set
out
to
delphi
to
inquire
of
the
oracle
about
returning
from
exile
and
the
pythian
prophetess
gave
him
this
answer
for
four
named
battos
and
four
named
arkesilaos
eight
generations
of
men
loxias
grants
to
you
to
be
kings
of
kyrene
but
beyond
this
he
counsels
you
not
even
to
attempt
it
thou
however
must
keep
quiet
when
thou
hast
come
back
to
thy
land
and
if
thou
findest
the
furnace
full
of
jars
heat
not
the
jars
fiercely
but
let
them
go
with
a
fair
wind
if
however
thou
heat
the
furnace
fiercely
enter
not
thou
into
the
place
flowed
round
by
water
for
if
thou
dost
thou
shalt
die
both
thou
and
the
bull
which
is
fairer
than
all
the
rest
thus
the
pythian
prophetess
gave
answer
to
arkesilaos
and
he
having
taken
to
him
those
in
samos
made
his
return
to
kyrene
and
when
he
had
got
possession
of
the
power
he
did
not
remember
the
saying
of
the
oracle
but
endeavoured
to
exact
penalties
from
those
of
the
opposite
faction
for
having
driven
him
out
of
these
some
escaped
out
of
the
country
altogether
but
some
arkesilaos
got
into
his
power
and
sent
them
away
to
cyprus
to
be
put
to
death
these
were
driven
out
of
their
course
to
cnidos
and
the
men
of
cnidos
rescued
them
and
sent
them
away
to
thera
some
others
however
of
the
kyrenians
fled
to
a
great
tower
belonging
to
aglomachos
a
private
citizen
and
arkesilaos
burnt
them
by
piling
up
brushwood
round
then
after
he
had
done
the
deed
he
perceived
that
the
oracle
meant
this
in
that
the
pythian
prophetess
forbade
him
if
he
found
the
jars
in
the
furnace
to
heat
them
fiercely
and
he
voluntarily
kept
away
from
the
city
of
the
kyrenians
fearing
the
death
which
had
been
prophesied
by
the
oracle
and
supposing
that
kyrene
was
flowed
round
by
water
now
he
had
to
wife
a
kinswoman
of
his
own
the
daughter
of
the
king
of
barca
whose
name
was
alazeir
to
him
he
came
and
men
of
barca
together
with
certain
of
the
exiles
from
kyrene
perceiving
him
going
about
in
the
killed
him
and
also
besides
him
his
alazeir
arkesilaos
accordingly
having
missed
the
meaning
of
the
oracle
whether
with
his
will
or
against
his
will
fulfilled
his
own
destiny
his
mother
pheretime
meanwhile
so
long
as
arkesilaos
having
worked
evil
for
himself
dwelt
at
barca
herself
held
the
royal
power
of
her
son
at
kyrene
both
exercising
his
other
rights
and
also
sitting
in
council
but
when
she
heard
that
her
son
had
been
slain
in
barca
she
departed
and
fled
to
egypt
for
she
had
on
her
side
services
done
for
cambyses
the
son
of
cyrus
by
arkesilaos
since
this
was
the
arkesilaos
who
had
given
over
kyrene
to
cambyses
and
had
laid
a
tribute
upon
himself
pheretime
then
having
come
to
egypt
sat
down
as
a
suppliant
of
aryandes
bidding
him
help
her
and
alleging
as
a
reason
that
it
was
on
account
of
his
inclination
to
the
side
of
the
medes
that
her
son
had
been
slain
now
this
aryandes
had
been
appointed
ruler
of
the
province
of
egypt
by
cambyses
and
after
the
time
of
these
events
he
lost
his
life
because
he
would
measure
himself
with
dareios
for
having
heard
and
seen
that
dareios
desired
to
leave
behind
him
as
a
memorial
of
himself
a
thing
which
had
not
been
made
by
any
other
king
he
imitated
him
until
at
last
he
received
his
reward
for
whereas
dareios
refined
gold
and
made
it
as
pure
as
possible
and
of
this
caused
coins
to
be
struck
aryandes
being
ruler
of
egypt
did
the
same
thing
with
silver
and
even
now
the
purest
silver
is
that
which
is
called
aryandic
dareios
then
having
learnt
that
he
was
doing
this
put
him
to
death
bringing
against
him
another
charge
of
attempting
rebellion
now
at
the
time
of
which
i
speak
this
aryandes
had
compassion
on
pheretime
and
gave
her
all
the
troops
that
were
in
egypt
both
the
land
and
the
sea
forces
appointing
amasis
a
maraphian
to
command
the
and
badres
of
the
race
of
the
pasargadai
to
command
the
fleet
but
before
he
sent
away
the
army
aryandes
despatched
a
herald
to
barca
and
asked
who
it
was
who
had
killed
arkesilaos
and
the
men
of
barca
all
took
it
upon
themselves
for
they
said
they
suffered
formerly
many
great
evils
at
his
hands
having
heard
this
aryandes
at
last
sent
away
the
army
together
with
pheretime
this
charge
then
was
the
pretext
alleged
but
in
fact
the
army
was
being
sent
out
as
i
believe
for
the
purpose
of
subduing
libya
for
of
the
libyans
there
are
many
nations
of
nations
of
various
kinds
and
but
few
of
them
are
subject
to
the
king
while
the
greater
number
paid
no
regard
to
dareios
now
the
libyans
have
their
dwelling
as
follows
from
egypt
first
of
the
libyans
are
settled
the
adyrmachidai
who
practise
for
the
most
part
the
same
customs
as
the
egyptians
but
wear
clothing
similar
to
that
of
the
other
libyans
their
women
wear
a
bronze
ring
upon
each
leg
and
they
have
long
hair
on
their
heads
and
when
they
catch
their
lice
each
one
bites
her
own
in
retaliation
and
then
throws
them
away
these
are
the
only
people
of
the
lybians
who
do
this
and
they
alone
display
to
the
king
their
maidens
when
they
are
about
to
be
married
and
whosoever
of
them
proves
to
be
pleasing
to
the
king
is
deflowered
by
him
these
adyrmachidai
extend
along
the
coast
from
egypt
as
far
as
the
port
which
is
called
plynos
next
after
these
come
the
giligamai
occupying
the
country
towards
the
west
as
far
as
the
island
of
aphrodisias
in
the
space
within
this
limit
lies
off
the
coast
the
island
of
platea
where
the
kyrenians
made
their
settlement
and
on
the
coast
of
the
mainland
there
is
port
menelaos
and
aziris
where
the
kyrenians
used
to
dwell
from
this
point
begins
the
silphion
and
it
extends
along
the
coast
from
the
island
of
platea
as
far
as
the
entrance
of
the
syrtis
this
nation
practises
customs
nearly
resembling
those
of
the
rest
next
to
the
giligamai
on
the
west
are
the
asbystai
these
dwell
above
kyrene
and
the
asbystai
do
not
reach
down
the
sea
for
the
region
along
the
sea
is
occupied
by
kyrenians
these
most
of
all
the
libyans
are
drivers
of
chariots
and
in
the
greater
number
of
their
customs
they
endeavour
to
imitate
the
kyrenians
next
after
the
asbystai
on
the
west
come
the
auchisai
these
dwell
above
barca
and
reach
down
to
the
sea
by
euesperides
and
in
the
middle
of
the
country
of
the
auchisai
dwell
the
bacales
a
small
tribe
who
reach
down
to
the
sea
by
the
city
of
taucheira
in
the
territory
of
barca
these
practise
the
same
customs
as
those
above
kyrene
next
after
these
auschisai
towards
the
west
come
the
nasamonians
a
numerous
race
who
in
the
summer
leave
their
flocks
behind
by
the
sea
and
go
up
to
the
region
of
augila
to
gather
the
fruit
of
the
which
grow
in
great
numbers
and
very
large
and
are
all
these
hunt
the
wingless
locusts
and
they
dry
them
in
the
sun
and
then
pound
them
up
and
after
that
they
sprinkle
them
upon
milk
and
drink
them
their
custom
is
for
each
man
to
have
many
wives
and
they
make
their
intercourse
with
them
common
in
nearly
the
same
manner
as
the
massagetai
that
is
they
set
up
a
staff
in
front
of
the
door
and
so
have
intercourse
when
a
nasamonian
man
marries
his
first
wife
the
custom
is
for
the
bride
on
the
first
night
to
go
through
the
whole
number
of
the
guests
having
intercourse
with
them
and
each
man
when
he
has
lain
with
her
gives
a
gift
whatsoever
he
has
brought
with
him
from
his
house
the
forms
of
oath
and
of
divination
which
they
use
are
as
follows
swear
by
the
men
among
themselves
who
are
reported
to
have
been
the
most
righteous
and
brave
by
these
i
say
laying
hands
upon
their
tombs
and
they
divine
by
visiting
the
sepulchral
mounds
of
their
ancestors
and
lying
down
to
sleep
upon
them
after
having
prayed
and
whatsoever
thing
the
man
sees
in
his
dream
this
he
accepts
they
practise
also
the
exchange
of
pledges
in
the
following
manner
that
is
to
say
one
gives
the
other
to
drink
from
his
hand
and
drinks
himself
from
the
hand
of
the
other
and
if
they
have
no
liquid
they
take
of
the
dust
from
the
ground
and
lick
it
adjoining
the
nasamonians
is
the
country
of
the
psylloi
these
have
perished
utterly
in
the
following
manner
south
wind
blowing
upon
them
dried
up
all
their
cisterns
of
water
and
their
land
was
waterless
lying
all
within
the
syrtis
they
then
having
taken
a
resolve
by
common
consent
marched
in
arms
against
the
south
wind
i
report
that
which
is
reported
by
the
libyans
and
when
they
had
arrived
at
the
sandy
tract
the
south
wind
blew
and
buried
them
in
the
sand
these
then
having
utterly
perished
the
nasamonians
from
that
time
forward
possess
their
land
above
these
towards
the
south
wind
in
the
region
of
wild
beasts
dwell
the
garamantians
who
fly
from
every
man
and
avoid
the
company
of
all
and
they
neither
possess
any
weapon
of
war
nor
know
how
to
defend
themselves
against
enemies
these
dwell
above
the
nasamonians
and
next
to
the
nasamonians
along
the
sea
coast
towards
the
west
come
the
macai
who
shave
their
hair
so
as
to
leave
tufts
letting
the
middle
of
their
hair
grow
long
but
round
this
on
all
sides
shaving
it
close
to
the
skin
and
for
fighting
they
carry
shields
made
of
ostrich
skins
through
their
land
the
river
kinyps
runs
out
into
the
sea
flowing
from
a
hill
called
the
hill
of
the
charites
this
hill
of
the
charites
is
overgrown
thickly
with
wood
while
the
rest
of
libya
which
has
been
spoken
of
before
is
bare
of
trees
and
the
distance
from
the
sea
to
this
hill
is
two
hundred
furlongs
next
to
these
macai
are
the
gindanes
whose
women
wear
each
of
them
a
number
of
anklets
made
of
the
skins
of
animals
for
the
following
reason
as
it
is
said
every
man
who
has
commerce
with
her
she
binds
on
an
anklet
and
the
woman
who
has
most
is
esteemed
the
best
since
she
has
been
loved
by
the
greatest
number
of
men
in
a
peninsula
which
stands
out
into
the
sea
from
the
land
of
these
gindanes
dwell
the
lotophagoi
who
live
by
eating
the
fruit
of
the
lotos
only
now
the
fruit
of
the
lotos
is
in
size
like
that
of
the
and
in
flavour
it
resembles
that
of
the
of
this
fruit
the
lotophagoi
even
make
for
themselves
wine
next
after
the
lotophagoi
along
the
are
the
machlyans
who
also
make
use
of
the
lotos
but
less
than
those
above
mentioned
these
extend
to
a
great
river
named
the
river
triton
and
this
runs
out
into
a
great
lake
called
tritonis
in
which
there
is
an
island
named
phla
about
this
island
they
say
there
was
an
oracle
given
to
the
lacedemonians
that
they
should
make
a
settlement
in
it
the
following
moreover
is
also
told
namely
that
jason
when
the
argo
had
been
completed
by
him
under
mount
pelion
put
into
it
a
hecatomb
and
with
it
also
a
tripod
of
bronze
and
sailed
round
pelopponese
desiring
to
come
to
delphi
and
when
in
sailing
he
got
near
malea
a
north
wind
seized
his
ship
and
carried
it
off
to
libya
and
before
he
caught
sight
of
land
he
had
come
to
be
in
the
shoals
of
the
lake
tritonis
then
as
he
was
at
a
loss
how
he
should
bring
his
ship
forth
the
story
goes
that
triton
appeared
to
him
and
bade
jason
give
him
the
tripod
saying
that
he
would
show
them
the
right
course
and
let
them
go
away
without
hurt
and
when
jason
consented
to
it
then
triton
showed
them
the
passage
out
between
the
shoals
and
set
the
tripod
in
his
own
temple
after
having
first
uttered
a
prophecy
over
the
tripod
and
having
declared
to
jason
and
his
company
the
whole
matter
namely
that
whensoever
one
of
the
descendants
of
those
who
sailed
with
him
in
the
argo
should
carry
away
this
tripod
then
it
was
determined
by
fate
that
a
hundred
cities
of
hellenes
should
be
established
about
the
lake
tritonis
having
heard
this
the
native
libyans
concealed
the
tripod
next
to
these
machlyans
are
the
auseans
these
and
the
machlyans
dwell
round
the
lake
tritonis
and
the
river
triton
is
the
boundary
between
them
and
while
the
machlyans
grow
their
hair
long
at
the
back
of
the
head
the
auseans
do
so
in
front
at
a
yearly
festival
of
athene
their
maidens
take
their
stand
in
two
parties
and
fight
against
one
another
with
stones
and
staves
and
they
say
that
in
doing
so
they
are
fulfilling
the
rites
handed
down
by
their
fathers
for
the
divinity
who
was
sprung
from
that
land
whom
we
call
athene
and
those
of
the
maidens
who
die
of
the
wounds
received
they
call
but
before
they
let
them
begin
the
fight
they
do
this
join
together
and
equip
the
maiden
who
is
judged
to
be
the
fairest
on
each
occasion
with
a
corinthian
helmet
and
with
full
hellenic
armour
and
then
causing
her
to
go
up
into
a
chariot
they
conduct
her
round
the
lake
now
i
can
not
tell
with
what
they
equipped
the
maidens
in
old
time
before
the
hellenes
were
settled
near
them
but
i
suppose
that
they
used
to
be
equipped
with
egyptian
armour
for
it
is
from
egypt
that
both
the
shield
and
the
helmet
have
come
to
the
hellenes
as
i
affirm
they
say
moreover
that
athene
is
the
daughter
of
poseidon
and
of
the
lake
tritonis
and
that
she
had
some
cause
of
complaint
against
her
father
and
therefore
gave
herself
to
zeus
and
zeus
made
her
his
own
daughter
such
is
the
story
which
these
tell
and
they
have
their
intercourse
with
women
in
common
not
marrying
but
having
intercourse
like
cattle
and
when
the
child
of
any
woman
has
grown
big
he
is
brought
before
a
meeting
of
the
men
held
within
three
months
of
that
time
and
whomsoever
of
the
men
the
child
resembles
his
son
he
is
accounted
to
be
thus
then
have
been
mentioned
those
nomad
libyans
who
live
along
the
and
above
these
inland
is
the
region
of
libya
which
has
wild
beasts
and
above
the
region
there
stretches
a
raised
belt
of
sand
extending
from
thebes
of
the
egyptians
to
the
pillars
of
heracles
in
this
belt
at
intervals
of
about
ten
days
journey
there
are
fragments
of
salt
in
great
lumps
forming
hills
and
at
the
top
of
each
hill
there
shoots
up
from
the
middle
of
the
salt
a
spring
of
water
cold
and
sweet
and
about
the
spring
dwell
men
at
the
furthest
limit
towards
the
desert
and
above
the
region
first
at
a
distance
of
ten
days
journey
from
thebes
are
the
ammonians
whose
temple
is
derived
from
that
of
the
theban
zeus
for
the
image
of
zeus
in
thebes
also
as
i
have
said
before
has
the
head
of
a
ram
these
as
it
chances
have
also
other
water
of
a
spring
which
in
the
early
morning
is
warm
at
the
time
when
the
market
fills
cooler
when
midday
comes
it
is
quite
cold
and
then
they
water
their
gardens
but
as
the
day
declines
it
abates
from
its
coldness
until
at
last
when
the
sun
sets
the
water
is
warm
and
it
continues
to
increase
in
heat
still
more
until
it
reaches
midnight
when
it
boils
and
throws
up
bubbles
and
when
midnight
passes
it
becomes
cooler
gradually
till
dawn
of
day
this
spring
is
called
the
fountain
of
the
sun
after
the
ammonians
as
you
go
on
along
the
belt
of
sand
at
an
interval
again
of
ten
days
journey
there
is
a
hill
of
salt
like
that
of
the
ammonians
and
a
spring
of
water
with
men
dwelling
about
it
and
the
name
of
this
place
is
augila
to
this
the
nasamonians
come
year
by
year
to
gather
the
fruit
of
the
from
augila
at
a
distance
again
of
ten
days
journey
there
is
another
hill
of
salt
and
spring
of
water
and
a
great
number
of
as
there
are
also
in
the
other
places
and
men
dwell
here
who
are
called
the
garmantians
a
very
great
nation
who
carry
earth
to
lay
over
the
salt
and
then
sow
crops
from
this
point
is
the
shortest
way
to
the
lotophagoi
for
from
these
it
is
a
journey
of
thirty
days
to
the
country
of
the
garmantians
among
them
also
are
produced
the
cattle
which
feed
backwards
and
they
feed
backwards
for
this
reason
because
they
have
their
horns
bent
down
forwards
and
therefore
they
walk
backwards
as
they
feed
for
forwards
they
can
not
go
because
the
horns
run
into
the
ground
in
front
of
them
but
in
nothing
else
do
they
differ
from
other
cattle
except
in
this
and
in
the
thickness
and
firmness
to
the
touch
of
their
hide
these
garamantians
of
whom
i
speak
hunt
the
ethiopians
with
their
chariots
for
the
ethiopians
are
the
swiftest
of
foot
of
all
men
about
whom
we
hear
report
made
and
the
feed
upon
serpents
and
lizards
and
such
creeping
things
and
they
use
a
language
which
resembles
no
other
for
in
it
they
squeak
just
like
bats
from
the
garmantians
at
a
distance
again
of
ten
days
journey
there
is
another
hill
of
salt
and
spring
of
water
and
men
dwell
round
it
called
atarantians
who
alone
of
all
men
about
whom
we
know
are
nameless
for
while
all
taken
together
have
the
name
atarantians
each
separate
man
of
them
has
no
name
given
to
him
these
utter
curses
against
the
sun
when
he
is
at
his
height
and
moreover
revile
him
with
all
manner
of
foul
terms
because
he
oppresses
them
by
his
burning
heat
both
themselves
and
their
land
after
this
at
a
distance
of
ten
days
journey
there
is
another
hill
of
salt
and
spring
of
water
and
men
dwell
round
it
near
this
salt
hill
is
a
mountain
named
atlas
which
is
small
in
circuit
and
rounded
on
every
side
and
so
exceedingly
lofty
is
it
said
to
be
that
it
is
not
possible
to
see
its
summits
for
clouds
never
leave
them
either
in
the
summer
or
in
the
winter
this
the
natives
say
is
the
pillar
of
the
heaven
after
this
mountain
these
men
got
their
name
for
they
are
called
atlantians
and
it
is
said
that
they
neither
eat
anything
that
has
life
nor
have
any
dreams
as
far
as
these
atlantians
i
am
able
to
mention
in
order
the
names
of
those
who
are
settled
in
the
belt
of
sand
but
for
the
parts
beyond
these
i
can
do
so
no
more
however
the
belt
extends
as
far
as
the
pillars
of
heracles
and
also
in
the
parts
outside
them
and
there
is
a
mine
of
salt
in
it
at
a
distance
of
ten
days
journey
from
the
atlantians
and
men
dwelling
there
and
these
all
have
their
houses
built
of
the
lumps
of
salt
since
these
parts
of
libya
which
we
have
now
reached
are
without
rain
for
if
it
rained
the
walls
being
made
of
salt
would
not
be
able
to
last
and
the
salt
is
dug
up
there
both
white
and
purple
in
colour
above
the
in
the
parts
which
are
in
the
direction
of
the
south
wind
and
towards
the
interior
of
libya
the
country
is
uninhabited
without
water
and
without
wild
beasts
rainless
and
treeless
and
there
is
no
trace
of
moisture
in
it
i
have
said
that
from
egypt
as
far
as
the
lake
tritonis
libyans
dwell
who
are
nomads
eating
flesh
and
drinking
milk
and
these
do
not
taste
at
all
of
the
flesh
of
cows
for
the
same
reason
as
the
egyptians
also
abstain
from
it
nor
do
they
keep
swine
moreover
the
women
of
the
kyrenians
too
think
it
not
right
to
eat
cows
flesh
because
of
the
egyptian
isis
and
they
even
keep
fasts
and
celebrate
festivals
for
her
and
the
women
of
barca
in
addition
from
cows
flesh
do
not
taste
of
swine
either
thus
it
is
with
these
matters
but
in
the
region
to
the
west
of
lake
tritonis
the
libyans
cease
to
be
nomads
and
they
do
not
practise
the
same
customs
nor
do
to
their
children
anything
like
that
which
the
nomads
are
wont
to
do
for
the
nomad
libyans
whether
all
of
them
i
can
not
say
for
certain
but
many
of
them
do
as
follows
their
children
are
four
years
old
they
burn
with
a
greasy
piece
of
wool
the
veins
in
the
crowns
of
their
heads
and
some
of
them
burn
the
veins
of
the
temples
so
that
for
all
their
lives
to
come
the
cold
humour
may
not
run
down
from
their
heads
and
do
them
hurt
and
for
this
reason
it
is
they
say
that
they
are
so
healthy
for
the
libyans
are
in
truth
the
most
healthy
of
all
races
concerning
which
we
have
knowledge
whether
for
this
reason
or
not
i
can
not
say
for
certain
but
the
most
healthy
they
certainly
are
and
if
when
they
burn
the
children
a
convulsion
comes
on
they
have
found
out
a
remedy
for
this
for
they
pour
upon
them
the
water
of
a
and
so
save
them
i
report
that
which
is
reported
by
the
libyans
themselves
the
following
is
the
manner
of
sacrifice
which
the
nomads
have
cut
off
a
part
of
the
animal
ear
as
a
first
offering
and
throw
it
over
the
house
and
having
done
this
they
twist
its
neck
they
sacrifice
only
to
the
sun
and
the
moon
that
is
to
say
to
these
all
the
libyans
sacrifice
but
those
who
dwell
round
the
lake
tritonis
sacrifice
most
of
all
to
athene
and
next
to
triton
and
poseidon
it
would
appear
also
that
the
hellenes
made
the
dress
and
the
aigis
of
the
images
of
athene
after
the
model
of
the
libyan
women
for
except
that
the
dress
of
the
libyan
women
is
of
leather
and
the
tassels
which
hang
from
their
aigis
are
not
formed
of
serpents
but
of
leather
thongs
in
all
other
respects
athene
is
dressed
like
them
moreover
the
name
too
declares
that
the
dress
of
the
figures
of
pallas
has
come
from
libya
for
the
libyan
women
wear
over
their
other
garments
bare
aigeas
with
tasselled
fringes
and
coloured
over
with
red
madder
and
from
the
name
of
these
the
hellenes
formed
the
name
aigis
i
think
also
that
in
these
regions
first
arose
the
practice
of
crying
aloud
during
the
performance
of
sacred
rites
for
the
libyan
women
do
this
very
well
the
hellenes
learnt
from
the
libyans
also
the
yoking
together
of
four
horses
the
nomads
bury
those
who
die
just
in
the
same
manner
as
the
hellenes
except
only
the
nasamonians
these
bury
bodies
in
a
sitting
posture
taking
care
at
the
moment
when
the
man
expires
to
place
him
sitting
and
not
to
let
him
die
lying
down
on
his
back
they
have
dwellings
composed
of
the
stems
of
asphodel
entwined
with
rushes
and
so
made
that
they
can
be
carried
about
such
are
the
customs
followed
by
these
tribes
on
the
west
of
the
river
triton
next
after
the
auseans
come
libyans
who
are
tillers
of
the
soil
and
whose
custom
it
is
to
possess
fixed
habitations
and
they
are
called
maxyans
they
grow
their
hair
long
on
the
right
side
of
their
heads
and
cut
it
short
upon
the
left
and
smear
their
bodies
over
with
red
ochre
these
say
that
they
are
of
the
men
who
came
from
troy
this
country
and
the
rest
of
libya
which
is
towards
the
west
is
both
much
more
frequented
by
wild
beasts
and
much
more
thickly
wooded
than
the
country
of
the
nomads
for
whereas
the
part
of
libya
which
is
situated
towards
the
east
where
the
nomads
dwell
is
and
sandy
up
to
the
river
triton
that
which
succeeds
it
towards
the
west
the
country
of
those
who
till
the
soil
is
exceedingly
mountainous
and
and
full
of
wild
beasts
for
in
the
land
of
these
are
found
both
the
monstrous
serpent
and
the
lion
and
the
elephant
and
bears
and
venomous
snakes
and
horned
asses
besides
the
men
and
the
headless
men
with
their
eyes
set
in
their
breasts
at
least
so
say
the
libyans
about
them
and
the
wild
men
and
wild
women
and
a
great
multitude
of
other
beasts
which
are
not
fabulous
like
these
in
the
land
of
the
nomads
however
there
exist
none
of
these
but
other
animals
as
follows
antelopes
gazelles
buffaloes
asses
not
the
horned
kind
but
others
which
go
without
water
for
in
fact
these
never
drink
oryes
whose
horns
are
made
into
the
sides
of
the
phenician
lyre
this
animal
is
in
size
about
equal
to
an
ox
small
foxes
hyenas
porcupines
wild
rams
wolves
jackals
panthers
boryes
about
three
cubits
in
length
and
very
much
resembling
lizards
ostriches
and
small
snakes
each
with
one
horn
these
wild
animals
there
are
in
this
country
as
well
as
those
which
exist
elsewhere
except
the
stag
and
the
but
libya
has
no
stags
nor
wild
boars
at
all
also
there
are
in
this
country
three
kinds
of
mice
one
is
called
the
mouse
another
the
zegeris
a
name
which
is
libyan
and
signifies
in
the
hellenic
tongue
a
hill
and
a
third
the
prickly
mouse
there
are
also
weasels
produced
in
the
silphion
which
are
very
like
those
of
tartessos
such
are
the
wild
animals
which
the
land
of
the
libyans
possesses
so
far
as
we
were
able
to
discover
by
inquiries
extended
as
much
as
possible
next
to
the
maxyan
libyans
are
the
zauekes
whose
women
drive
their
chariots
for
them
to
war
next
to
these
are
the
gyzantes
among
whom
honey
is
made
in
great
quantity
by
bees
but
in
much
greater
quantity
still
it
is
said
to
be
made
by
men
who
work
at
it
as
a
trade
however
that
may
be
these
all
smear
themselves
over
with
red
ochre
and
eat
monkeys
which
are
produced
in
very
great
numbers
upon
their
mountains
opposite
these
as
the
carthaginians
say
there
lies
an
island
called
kyrauis
two
hundred
furlongs
in
length
but
narrow
to
which
one
may
walk
over
from
the
mainland
and
it
is
full
of
olives
and
vines
in
it
they
say
there
is
a
pool
from
which
the
native
girls
with
feathers
smeared
over
with
pitch
bring
up
out
of
the
mud
whether
this
is
really
so
i
do
not
know
but
i
write
that
which
is
reported
and
nothing
is
impossible
for
even
in
zakynthos
i
saw
myself
pitch
brought
up
out
of
a
pool
of
water
there
are
there
several
pools
and
the
largest
of
them
measures
seventy
feet
each
way
and
is
two
fathoms
in
depth
into
this
they
plunge
a
pole
with
a
bound
to
it
and
then
with
the
branch
of
the
myrtle
they
bring
up
pitch
which
has
the
smell
of
asphalt
but
in
other
respects
it
is
superior
to
the
pitch
of
pieria
this
they
pour
into
a
pit
dug
near
the
pool
and
when
they
have
collected
a
large
quantity
then
they
pour
it
into
the
jars
from
the
pit
and
whatever
thing
falls
into
the
pool
goes
under
ground
and
reappears
in
the
sea
which
is
distant
about
four
furlongs
from
the
pool
thus
then
the
report
about
the
island
lying
near
the
coast
of
libya
is
also
probably
enough
true
the
carthaginians
say
also
this
namely
that
there
is
a
place
in
libya
and
men
dwelling
there
outside
the
pillars
of
heracles
to
whom
when
they
have
come
and
have
taken
the
merchandise
forth
from
their
ships
they
set
it
in
order
along
the
beach
and
embark
again
in
their
ships
and
after
that
they
raise
a
smoke
and
the
natives
of
the
country
seeing
the
smoke
come
to
the
sea
and
then
they
lay
down
gold
as
an
equivalent
for
the
merchandise
and
retire
to
a
distance
away
from
the
merchandise
the
carthaginians
upon
that
disembark
and
examine
it
and
if
the
gold
is
in
their
opinion
sufficient
for
the
value
of
the
merchandise
they
take
it
up
and
go
their
way
but
if
not
they
embark
again
in
their
ships
and
sit
there
and
the
others
approach
and
straightway
add
more
gold
to
the
former
until
they
satisfy
them
and
they
say
that
neither
party
wrongs
the
other
for
neither
do
the
carthaginians
lay
hands
on
the
gold
until
it
is
made
equal
to
the
value
of
their
merchandise
nor
do
the
others
lay
hands
on
the
merchandise
until
the
carthaginians
have
taken
the
gold
these
are
the
libyan
tribes
whom
we
are
able
to
name
and
of
these
the
greater
number
neither
now
pay
any
regard
to
the
king
of
the
medes
nor
did
they
then
thus
much
also
i
have
to
say
about
this
land
namely
that
it
is
occupied
by
four
races
and
no
more
so
far
as
we
know
and
of
these
races
two
are
natives
of
the
soil
and
the
other
two
not
so
for
the
libyans
and
the
ethiopians
are
natives
the
one
race
dwelling
in
the
northern
parts
of
libya
and
the
other
in
the
southern
while
the
phenicians
and
the
hellenes
are
strangers
i
think
moreover
that
besides
other
things
in
goodness
of
soil
libya
does
not
very
greatly
excel
as
compared
with
asia
or
europe
except
only
the
region
of
kinyps
for
the
same
name
is
given
to
the
land
as
to
the
river
this
region
is
equal
to
the
best
of
lands
in
bringing
forth
the
fruit
of
demeter
nor
does
it
at
all
resemble
the
rest
of
libya
for
it
has
black
soil
and
is
watered
by
springs
and
neither
has
it
fear
of
drought
nor
is
it
hurt
by
drinking
too
abundantly
of
rain
for
rain
there
is
in
this
part
of
libya
of
the
produce
of
the
crops
the
same
measures
hold
good
here
as
for
the
babylonian
land
and
that
is
good
land
also
which
the
euesperites
occupy
for
when
it
bears
best
it
produces
a
but
the
land
in
the
region
of
kinyps
produces
sometimes
as
much
as
moreover
the
land
of
kyrene
which
is
the
highest
land
of
the
part
of
libya
which
is
occupied
by
nomads
has
within
its
confines
three
seasons
of
harvest
at
which
we
may
marvel
for
the
parts
by
the
first
have
their
fruits
ripe
for
reaping
and
for
gathering
the
vintage
and
when
these
have
been
gathered
in
the
parts
which
lie
above
the
places
those
situated
in
the
middle
which
they
call
the
hills
are
ripe
for
the
gathering
in
and
as
soon
as
this
middle
crop
has
been
gathered
in
that
in
the
highest
part
of
the
land
comes
to
perfection
and
is
ripe
so
that
by
the
time
the
first
crop
has
been
eaten
and
drunk
up
the
last
is
just
coming
in
thus
the
harvest
for
the
kyrenians
lasts
eight
months
let
so
much
as
has
been
said
suffice
for
these
things
now
when
the
persian
helpers
of
pheretime
having
been
sent
from
egypt
by
aryandes
had
arrived
at
barca
they
laid
siege
to
the
city
proposing
to
the
inhabitants
that
they
should
give
up
those
who
were
guilty
of
the
murder
of
arkesilaos
but
as
all
their
people
had
taken
a
share
in
the
guilt
they
did
not
accept
the
proposals
then
they
besieged
barca
for
nine
months
both
digging
underground
passages
which
led
to
the
wall
and
making
vigorous
attacks
upon
it
now
the
passages
dug
were
discovered
by
a
worker
of
bronze
with
a
shield
covered
over
with
bronze
who
had
thought
of
a
plan
as
follows
it
round
within
the
wall
he
applied
it
to
the
ground
in
the
city
and
whereas
the
other
places
to
which
he
applied
it
were
noiseless
at
those
places
where
digging
was
going
on
the
bronze
of
the
shield
gave
a
sound
and
the
men
of
barca
would
make
a
countermine
there
and
slay
the
persians
who
were
digging
mines
this
then
was
discovered
as
i
have
said
and
the
attacks
were
repulsed
by
the
men
of
barca
then
as
they
were
suffering
hardship
for
a
long
time
and
many
were
falling
on
both
sides
and
especially
on
that
of
the
persians
amasis
the
commander
of
the
contrived
as
follows
that
the
barcaians
were
not
to
be
conquered
by
force
but
might
be
conquered
by
guile
he
dug
by
night
a
broad
trench
and
over
it
he
laid
timber
of
no
great
strength
and
brought
earth
and
laid
it
above
on
the
top
of
the
timber
making
it
level
with
the
rest
of
the
ground
then
at
daybreak
he
invited
the
men
of
barca
to
a
parley
and
they
gladly
consented
and
at
last
they
agreed
to
make
a
treaty
and
the
treaty
they
made
with
one
another
was
taken
over
the
hidden
trench
namely
that
so
long
as
this
earth
should
continue
to
be
as
it
was
so
long
the
oath
should
remain
firm
and
that
the
men
of
barca
should
promise
to
pay
tribute
of
due
amount
to
the
king
and
the
persians
should
do
no
further
violence
to
the
men
of
barca
after
the
oath
the
men
of
barca
trusting
to
these
engagements
both
went
forth
themselves
from
their
city
and
let
any
who
desired
it
of
the
enemy
pass
within
their
walls
having
opened
all
the
gates
but
the
persians
first
broke
down
the
concealed
bridge
and
then
began
to
run
inside
the
city
wall
and
the
reason
why
they
broke
down
the
bridge
which
they
had
made
was
that
they
might
keep
their
oaths
since
they
had
sworn
to
the
men
of
barca
that
the
oath
should
remain
firm
continually
for
so
long
time
as
the
earth
should
remain
as
it
then
was
but
after
that
they
had
broken
it
down
the
oath
no
longer
remained
firm
now
the
most
guilty
of
the
barcaians
when
they
were
delivered
to
her
by
the
persians
pheretime
impaled
in
a
ring
round
about
the
wall
and
she
cut
off
the
breasts
of
their
wives
and
set
the
wall
round
with
these
also
in
order
but
the
rest
of
the
men
of
barca
she
bade
the
persians
carry
off
as
spoil
except
so
many
of
them
as
were
of
the
house
of
battos
and
not
sharers
in
the
guilt
of
the
murder
and
to
these
pheretime
gave
the
city
in
charge
so
the
persians
having
made
slaves
of
the
rest
of
the
barcaians
departed
to
go
back
and
when
they
appeared
at
the
gates
of
the
city
of
kyrene
the
kyrenians
let
them
go
through
their
town
in
order
to
avoid
neglect
of
some
oracle
then
as
the
army
was
going
through
badres
the
commander
of
the
fleet
urged
that
they
should
capture
the
city
but
amasis
the
commander
of
the
would
not
consent
to
it
for
he
said
that
they
had
been
sent
against
no
other
city
of
the
hellenes
except
barca
when
however
they
had
passed
through
and
were
encamping
on
the
hill
of
zeus
lycaios
they
repented
of
not
having
taken
possession
of
kyrene
and
they
endeavoured
again
to
pass
into
it
but
the
men
of
kyrene
would
not
allow
them
then
upon
the
persians
although
no
one
fought
against
them
there
fell
a
sudden
panic
and
they
ran
away
for
about
sixty
furlongs
and
then
encamped
and
when
the
camp
had
been
placed
here
there
came
to
it
a
messenger
from
aryandes
summoning
them
back
so
the
persians
asked
the
kyrenians
to
give
them
provisions
for
their

the

killed
for
the
sake
of
their
clothes
and

those
of
them
who
at
any
time
were
left

straggled
behind
until
at

they
came
to

this
army
of

reached

this
was
their
furthest
point
in

those
of

whom
they
had
reduced
to
slavery
they
removed
again
from

and
brought
them
to

king
dareios
gave
them
a
village
in
the

of

in
which
to
make
a
settlement
to
this
village
they
gave
the
name
of

it
still
continued
to
be
inhabited
by
them

down

for

soon
as

had
returned
from
libya
to

after
having
avenged
herself
on
the
barcaians
she
died
an
evil
death
having
become
suddenly
full
of
worms
while
yet
alive
for
as
it
seems
too
severe
punishments
inflicted
by

prove
displeasing
to

some

been

to
others
the
attack
on

but
this
had
not
been

some

and
katapausantes
the
expression
is
awkward
if
meant
to
be
equivalent
to
kai
katepausan
but
it
is
hardly
improved
by
the
alteration
to
katapausontes
perhaps
the
clause
is
out
of
place
ponos
peristixantes
so
the
two
best
mss
others
have
peristesantes
or
peristexantes
the
word
peristixantes
would
be
from
peristikho
equivalent
to
peristikhizo
and
is
acknowledged
in
this
sense
by
hesychius
the
connexion
is
not
clear
either
at
the
beginning
of
the
chapter
or
here
this
clause
would
seem
to
be
a
repetition
of
that
at
the
beginning
of
the
chapter
and
that
which
comes
between
should
be
an
explanation
of
the
reason
why
the
slaves
are
blinded
as
it
stands
however
we
can
only
refer
it
to
the
clause
which
follows
ou

and
even
so
there
is
no
real
solution
of
the
difficulty
for
it
is
not
explained
why
nomads
should
have
blinded
slaves
perhaps
the
best
resource
is
to
suppose
that
some
part
of
the
explanation
in
connexion
with
the
manner
of
dealing
with

been
