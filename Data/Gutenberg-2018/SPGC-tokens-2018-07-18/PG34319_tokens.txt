ramirez
hard
voice
cut
through
the
roar
of
the
isotov
turboshafts
down
below
the
cold
aegean
churned
with
a
late
autumn
storm
any
lower
and
there
be
surface
effect
i
well
aware
of
that
the
iranian
pilot
muttered
a
sullen
response
barely
audible
above
the
helicopter
noise
and
vibration
it
stopped
just
short
of
open
disrespect
sabri
ramirez
did
not
mind
the
two
iranians
had
been
an
unfortunate
necessity
but
in
three
days
they
would
be
dead
the
others
the
professionals
were
the
ones
who
counted
when
he
the
european
terrorists
now
resting
on
the
four
litters
in
the
main
cabin
he
had
gone
for
the
best
each
man
had
a
track
record
and
a
purpose
ramirez
however
was
the
leader
fully
in
control
he
had
planned
financed
and
now
commanded
the
operation
in
the
ghostly
light
of
late
evening
his
sleek
cheeks
shaded
temples
and
trim
mustache
gave
no
hint
of
the
extensive
plastic
surgery
that
had
created
this
his
latest
face
he
wore
a
black
jumpsuit
like
the
others
but
under
his
was
a
brioni
charcoal
perhaps
more
suited
for
a
dinner
in
paris
at
or
la
tour
than
the
operation
at
hand
all
the
same
he
felt
comfortably
at
home
in
this
helicopter
gunship
the
most
lethal
assault
machine
ever
their
operation
had
two
objectives
and
the
first
had
just
appeared
on
the
bright
green
cockpit
radar
it
was
the
frigate
glover
garcia
class
which
the
national
security
agency
had
converted
into
a
spy
platform
loaded
with
and
antennas
it
had
to
go
ramirez
expected
no
difficulties
like
the
uss
stark
the
frigate
disabled
by
iraqi
exocet
missiles
in
the
persian
gulf
in
it
was
a
perfect
target
with
only
one
gun
it
would
be
child
play
for
a
hind
activate
iff
he
ordered
glancing
back
at
the
instrument
panels
they
should
acquire
us
on
radar
within
two
minutes
now
iff
on
salim
khan
the
iranian
nodded
and
reached
for
the
in
the
panel
on
his
right
they
were
using
the
nato
identification
system
a
interrogator
into
which
they
had
programmed
the
false
israeli
identification
friend
or
foe
code
the
gray
box
would
receive
the
electronic
query
are
you
a
friend
and
it
would
automatically
reply
yes
this
aircraft
is
friendly
ramirez
watched
with
satisfaction
as
the
green
numbers
flashed
deception
he
thought
the
key
to
everything
in
the
intelligence
dossiers
of
mossad
and
the
cia
he
was
known
as
the
hyena
killer
of
hundreds
in
europe
and
the
middle
east
but
his
most
cherished
recent
fact
in
those
dossiers
was
the
item
declaring
the
disbanding
of
his
private
organization
he
thankfully
had
been
written
off
of
course
the
analysts
reasoned
over
their
pipes
and
printouts
of
course
the
chimera
named
sabri
ramirez
must
be
dead
his
unmistakable
touch
had
not
been
on
a
bombing
in
years
the
playboy
terrorist
who
flaunted
silk
suits
had
cellars
of
rare
vintage
wines
in
tripoli
damascus
baghdad
and
beirut
that
man
would
just
retire
he
had
to
be
they
were
half
right
he
had
wearied
of
the
squabbles
and
disputes
of
a
organization
however
he
had
not
lost
his
taste
for
money
or
his
hatred
of
the
united
states
now
that
nato
was
falling
apart
america
was
trying
to
take
over
the
middle
east
aided
by
its
european
lackeys
but
he
had
put
together
a
plan
that
would
end
america
global
military
intimidation
once
and
for
all
not
coincidentally
he
was
going
to
acquire
eight
hundred
million
dollars
in
the
process
we
be
exposed
he
continued
but
just
for
about
three
minutes
they
only
have
one
gun
a
caliber
dp
mark
mounted
on
the
forward
deck
it
is
in
plain
view
remember
i
need
a
clear
window
for
the
swatter
after
we
neutralize
their
main
ordnance
we
come
about
and
strafe
the
communications
gear
he
hoped
this
dense
iranian
understood
the
approach
profile
he
had
briefed
the
man
over
and
over
but
still
he
was
not
sure
it
had
sunk
in
he
examined
salim
khan
one
last
time
the
bulky
face
with
sunken
almost
depressed
eyes
and
stifled
a
sigh
of
exasperation
iranians
still
he
had
better
not
offend
the
man
honor
after
all
salim
had
stolen
the
hind
gunship
they
were
now
flying
from
the
iranian
air
force
providing
a
crucial
component
in
the
overall
operation
a
rare
prize
the
hind
had
been
secretly
purchased
by
the
iaf
from
an
afghan
rebel
unit
which
had
captured
it
in
iran
had
wanted
to
see
one
up
close
against
the
day
the
soviets
might
turn
their
paranoia
against
them
and
try
to
invade
that
day
had
never
come
and
now
this
disaffected
air
force
lieutenant
had
simply
stolen
it
at
last
ramirez
thought
with
satisfaction
their
valued
prize
would
be
put
to
use
salim
khan
had
mastered
the
hind
controls
years
before
had
flown
it
often
and
just
four
days
ago
he
had
taken
it
up
shot
his
weapons
operator
and
used
a
fake
identity
to
file
a
new
flight
plan
setting
down
to
refuel
in
rawalpindi
the
theft
had
caused
a
tempest
when
they
discovered
it
the
mullahs
had
blamed
america
and
engineered
a
demonstration
in
the
streets
of
tehran
so
they
could
bray
in
the
press
but
by
that
time
he
had
already
taken
it
out
over
the
gulf
and
landed
it
on
the
camouflaged
greek
cargo
ship
they
had
waiting
after
navigating
the
suez
canal
that
ship
was
now
anchored
safely
off
crete
main
port
of
iraklion
for
salim
khan
who
had
twice
been
passed
over
for
promotion
to
captain
the
taste
of
revenge
in
that
theft
was
sweet
indeed
the
most
important
part
of
the
approach
ramirez
went
on
is
to
make
sure
we
id
by
their
vis
their
visual
identification
system
crucial
they
make
our
israeli
markings
the
looked
like
nothing
else
in
the
world
one
of
a
kind
its
visual
profile
dark
green
against
the
sunset
hues
of
the
sky
should
be
unmistakable
or
so
he
hoped
almost
sixty
feet
long
and
over
twenty
feet
high
it
had
a
main
rotor
feet
in
diameter
and
a
heavy
retractable
landing
gear
the
tandem
stations
in
the
nose
for
the
weapons
operator
and
the
pilot
above
him
had
individual
canopies
with
the
rear
seat
raised
to
give
the
pilot
an
unobstructed
forward
view
any
schoolboy
should
be
able
to
identify
one
a
mile
away
as
well
as
its
israeli
markings
the
blue
star
of
david
in
a
white
circle
i
still
think
it
unnecessary
salim
khan
mumbled
into
his
beard
it
only
adds
to
our
risk
it
would
be
better
a
visual
id
is
essential
ramirez
cut
him
off
when
they
make
it
they
go
through
the
sixth
fleet
hq
in
gournes
for
verification
then
just
acquired
us
on
radar
the
iranian
interjected
as
a
pitched
alert
sounded
from
the
instrument
panel
and
a
line
of
green
warning
diodes
turned
red
right
on
schedule
ramirez
nodded
the
navy
never
sleeps
he
turned
and
motioned
to
one
of
the
men
crouched
on
a
litter
in
the
main
cabin
shouting
above
the
noise
peretz
it
time
to
start
earning
your
share
dore
peretz
a
veteran
of
the
weizman
institute
was
a
specialist
in
strategic
weapons
and
their
delivery
but
that
was
another
life
now
he
was
ramirez
had
picked
him
for
his
technical
skills
and
his
greed
he
rose
and
made
his
way
forward
working
carefully
through
the
jumble
of
legs
and
automatic
weapons
he
was
younger
than
he
appeared
his
prematurely
hair
made
him
look
late
forties
though
he
actually
was
only
he
settled
into
the
weapons
station
below
salim
pulling
down
his
black
turtleneck
the
better
to
accommodate
a
flight
helmet
and
went
to
work
are
you
ready
he
asked
salim
in
perfect
farsi
i
am
ready
if
god
is
ready
the
iranian
replied
grimly
his
eyes
beginning
to
gleam
from
the
strain
peretz
reached
down
and
switched
the
radio
to
megahertz
the
military
emergency
channel
mayday
mayday
israeli
hawk
one
requesting
permission
for
emergency
approach
he
then
repeated
the
announcement
in
hebrew
it
was
of
course
a
pointless
gesture
for
the
illiterate
americans
but
for
now
verisimilitude
counted
we
copy
you
hawk
one
this
is
uss
glover
we
acquired
you
on
radar
came
back
the
response
a
southern
drawl
young
and
slightly
nervous
what
seems
to
be
the
problem
one
of
our
turboshafts
has
started
losing
oil
pressure
we
could
use
a
visual
check
what
your
position
he
glanced
down
at
the
green
radar
screen
and
grinned
it
showed
the
frigate
coordinates
to
within
meters
the
radioman
complied
with
his
request
then
continued
there
could
be
a
problem
hawk
one
the
storm
just
pushed
the
sea
over
four
feet
it
a
helluva
permission
to
approach
we
have
a
situation
here
he
continued
in
english
have
to
check
that
with
the
tao
we
got
a
perimeter
came
back
the
uneasy
answer
fuck
your
perimeter
sailor
peretz
voice
was
harder
now
this
is
lieutenant
colonel
leon
daniel
israeli
air
force
we
got
an
emergency
and
we
coming
in
tell
that
to
your
tao
and
get
us
perimeter
clearance
we
coming
by
he
switched
off
his
mike
well
done
ramirez
nodded
his
approval
just
the
right
combination
of
entreaty
and
bravado
i
think
the
americans
will
be
stymied
the
policy
they
like
to
talk
about
he
leaned
back
and
wished
he
had
a
cigar
the
other
men
waiting
crouched
in
the
dark
had
understood
only
some
of
the
english
they
were
four
germans
a
frenchman
and
a
greek
conditional
clearance
granted
crackled
the
radio

we
have
to

roger
uss
glover
peretz
spoke
back
sharply
in
his
best
military
style
keep
the
coffee
hot
it
always
hot
sir
this
is
the
navy
appreciated
glad
to
be
of
help
hawk
one
peretz
clicked
off
the
radio
and
turned
around
i
think
they
bought
it
so
far
so
good
ramirez
nodded
he
descended
the
three
steps
down
into
the
lower
cockpit
the
weapons
station
and
stood
behind
peretz
looking
it
over
again
the
offensive
capability
included
a
machine
gun
in
a
turret
under
the
nose
as
well
as
packs
of
rockets
secured
on
hardpoints
on
each
stubby
auxiliary
wing
finally
the
wingtips
carried
four
swatter
homing
antitank
missiles
two
on
each
side
plenty
of
firepower
for
what
he
intended
remember
he
said
to
salim
as
he
moved
back
up
no
hint
of
hostile
action
until
after
they
make
the
id
would
the
stubborn
iranian
hold
steady
stick
to
the
procedure
he
checked
his
watch
four
and
a
half
minutes
should
take
them
inside
the
vis
range
the
altimeter
showed
that
they
were
now
at
eleven
hundred
meters
and
so
far
the
iranian
was
bringing
her
in
perfectly
of
course
after
the
frigate
confirmed
they
were
flying
a
hind
but
by
then
it
would
be
too
late
i
was
doubling
cape
maleas
when
the
swell
the
current
and
the
north
wind
combined
to
drive
me
sidelong
off
my
course
and
send
me
drifting
past
kythera
the
force
of
the
gusts
tore
my
sails
to
tatters
and
for
nine
days
i
was
chased
by
those
accursed
winds
across
the
seas
but
on
the
tenth
i
made
the
country
of
the
from
the
odyssey
book

do

michael
vance
was
exhilarated
and
scared
the
salty
taste
of
the
aegean
was
in
his
mouth
as
he
reached
for
the
black
mike
of
his
radio
still
gripping
the
starboard
tiller
his
waterproof
ross
dsc
was
topside
since
there
was
no
other
place
for
it
he
was
lean
with
leathery
skin
and
taut
tanned
cheeks
all
the
more
so
for
his
having
spent
the
last
three
days
fighting
the
sea
he
had
dark
brown
hair
and
a
high
forehead
above
eyebrows
that
set
off
inquiring
blue
eyes
his
face
had
mileage
yet
was
curiously
warm
with
a
slim
nose
that
barely
showed
where
it
had
been
broken
year
before
last
during
an
arm
special
op
in
iran
is
that
you
bill
good
to
hear
your
voice
but
this
is
a
hell
of
a
time
who
else
would
it
be
you
loony
gringo
hey
i
getting
a
damned
lot
of
static
how
about
switching
channels
over
to
seventy
seventy
confirmed
he
pushed
in
the
code
his
fingers
slippery
and
wet
the
wind
was
already
gusting
up
to
thirty
knots
while
his
boat
was
crabbing
across
the
growing
swell
okay
you
on
listen
old
buddy
the
voice
continued
clearer
now
that
it
was
digital
our
weather
radar
shows
a
squall
building
in
the
north
up
in
the
sporades
and
it
looks
like
it
could
be
a
real
bear
it
going
to
be
all
over
your
butt
in
no
time
thought
i
better
let
you
know
you
ought
to
try
and
hole
up
down
on
the
south
side
of
kythera
kythera
was
an
island
just
off
the
southeast
tip
of
peloponnesos
it
was
now
looming
off
vance
starboard
bow
barren
mountains
and
sheer
cliffs
i
been
watching
it
he
yelled
back
into
the
mike
holding
it
close
to
shield
it
from
the
howl
of
wind
the
gale
was
coming
in
at
an
angle
to
the
waves
creating
two
swells
running
at
ninety
degrees
and
the
sea
was
getting
short
and
confused
but
i
think
i
can
ride
it
out
making
probably
seven
or
eight
knots
he
paused
then
decided
to
add
a
little
bravado
no
point
in
admitting
how
worried
he
was
just
a
little
rock
and
roll
horseshit
friend
this
thing
for
real
you
better
head
for
cover
it
was
the
profane
oversmoked
voice
of
bill
bates
ceo
of
satcom
who
been
monitoring
his
trip
using
the
awesome
electronics
he
installed
on
the
little
island
of
andikythera
fifteen
kilometers
south
of
kythera
even
old
ulysses
himself
had
that
much
sense
and
it
common
knowledge
that
guy
did
know
about
sailing
took
him
ten
years
to
get
home
remember
that
inlet
on
the
south
side
of
the
island
that
little
harbor
at
kapsali
we
put
in
once
for
a
drink
last
year
i
respectfully
suggest
you
get
your
ass
over
there
and
drop
anchor
as
soon
as
possible
and
let
you
win
no
way
jose
he
was
jamming
his
weight
against
the
starboard
tiller
and
the
radio
was
distracting
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
the
wager
with
bates
was
ironclad
retrace
ulysses
route
in
a
fortnight
and
do
it
without
ever
touching
land
i
just
think
getting
worried
you
suddenly
remembered
we
got
ten
large
riding
on
this
somebody
got
to
lose
and
it
going
to
be
you
pal
you
a
headstrong
idiot
michael
bates
sputtered
fuck
the
ten
grand
i
do
want
it
and
you
do
need
it
i
hereby
going
on
record
as
taking
no
responsibility
for
this
idiotic
stunt
from
this
point
on
you
really
pushing
your
luck
we
both
know
this
ai
about
money
i
got
a
reputation
to
live
up
to
like
finding
out
how
many
ways
i
can
kill
myself
he
thought
jesus
how
did
i
get
into
this
he
reached
to
secure
the
linen
sail
line
to
a
wooden
cleat
the
heightening
swell
was
churning
over
the
gunwales
soaking
him
as
it
drove
the
bow
to
leeward
well
for
once
in
your
life
use
some
sense
the
risk
is
worth
it
our
weather
radar
here
at
the
facility
tells
no
lies
and
you
should
see
it
this
is
going
to
be
a
granddaddy
i
triangulated
your
position
and
you
only
about
four
klicks
off
the
east
side
of
kythera
you
could
still
run
for
that
little
harbor
down
south
before
it
hits
i
know
where
i
am
i
can
just
make
out
the
island
off
my
starboard
bow
about
two
it
tempting
he
told
himself
damned
tempting
but
not
just
yet
go
for
it
bates
coughed
listen
you
crazy
i
have
to
get
back
out
to
control
we
got
a
major
of
the
cyclops
laser
system
scheduled
tonight
for
hours
so
use
your
head
for
once
goddammit
and
make
for
that
anchorage
your
views
are
taken
under
advisement
but
a
great
american
philosopher
once
said
it
ai
over
till
it
over
he
pushed
the
thumb
switch
on
the
microphone
clicking
it
off
then
he
switched
it
on
again
by
the
way
amigo
good
luck
with
the
test
the
cyclops
was
going
to
power
the
world
first
space
vehicle
who
knew
if
it
would
work
we
may
need
it
catch
you
again
at
see
you
then
if
i
still
around
he
thought
he
clicked
off
his
mike
then
switched
back
to
channel
sixteen
the
radio
was
the
only
electronic
equipment
he
had
permitted
himself
he
enjoyed
monitoring
the
greek
chatter
coming
from
the
island
fishing
boats
and
trawlers
which
worked
nights
lots
of
bragging
now
though
the
bursts
of
talk
on
the
open
channel
were
all
about
the
building
storm
the
fishing
boats
this
night
had
abandoned
the
aegean
to
the
massive
ferries
in
fact
those
white
monsters
were
his
real
concern
more
than
the
storm
had
no
radar
and
his
tiny
mast
lantern
would
just
melt
into
the
rain
when
the
storm
hit
sailing
in
the
dark
and
in
a
squall
was
a
game
of
pure
defense
he
had
to
keep
every
sense
alert
sight
hearing
even
smell
he
prayed
the
ferry
lanes
would
be
empty
tonight
a
nomicos
line
could
slice
his
little
homemade
toy
in
half
without
ever
knowing
he
was
there
was
a
wooden
bark
planked
construction
of
cypress
on
oak
that
no
sane
man
would
have
taken
out
of
a
marina
but
michael
vance
was
hoping
to
prove
to
the
world
that
the
fabled
voyage
of
ulysses
from
troy
back
to
greece
could
have
happened
unlike
anything
seen
afloat
for
almost
three
thousand
years
his
yacht
was
in
fact
an
authentic
replica
of
a
mycenaean
warship
painted
lavender
and
gold
the
ancient
greeks
loved
bold
colors
she
could
have
been
a
ride
but
every
time
he
looked
her
over
he
felt
proud
his
browned
cracked
fingers
gripped
the
wet
wood
as
the
sea
churned
ever
higher
now
blotting
out
the
dim
line
of
the
horizon
the
storm
was
arriving
just
as
daylight
faded
the
worst
moment
enough
thinking
he
ordered
himself
audibly
above
the
gale
it
bad
for
the
reflexes
just
keep
the
tiller
to
leeward
and
do
shorten
sail
go
for
it
just
get
around
kythera
then
heave
to
and
lie
in
the
lee
till
the
worst
is
over
another
five
maybe
six
kilometers
should
do
it
vance
was
greek
he
was
american
and
looked
it
as
for
greece
and
things
greek
he
preferred
tequila
over
ouzo
a
sirloin
to
chewy
grilled
octopus
all
the
same
years
ago
he
had
gotten
a
in
greek
archaeology
from
yale
taught
there
for
two
years
then
published
a
celebrated
and
radical
theory
about
the
palace
of
knossos
on
crete
the
book
had
caused
an
uproar
in
the
scholarly
community
and
in
the
aftermath
he
had
drifted
away
from
the
world
of
the
ancient
greeks
for
several
years
with
this
project
he
liked
to
think
he
was
coming
back
home
he
had
just
turned
and
it
was
about
time
age
more
and
more
lately
he
realized
he
preferred
old
things
transmissions
tube
amplifiers
vinyl
recordings
anything
without
numbers
that
glowed
was
as
close
to
that
feeling
as
he
could
get
coming
in
now
was
his
first
real
weather
and
he
had
his
numb
pained
fingers
crossed
his
creation
had
certain
historically
precise
features
yet
to
be
fully
tested
in
high
seas
he
had
built
her
in
the
style
of
ships
in
homer
time
which
meant
she
was
hardly
more
than
a
raft
with
washboard
sides
four
meters
across
the
beam
with
a
shallow
draft
of
a
meter
and
a
half
she
was
undecked
except
for
a
longitudinal
gangway
over
the
cargo
and
platforms
at
the
bow
and
stern
protected
with
latticework
to
deflect
enemy
spears
it
did
not
help
much
however
against
the
swell
the
keel
extended
forward
at
the
bow
supposedly
for
additional
lateral
plane
and
that
was
a
plus
when
reaching
with
the
wind
abeam
or
tacking
to
windward
but
now
running
downwind
it
increased
her
tendency
to
sheer
about
all
his
strength
was
needed
on
the
tillers
just
to
keep
her
aright
there
were
other
problems
maybe
he
thought
ulysses
had
them
too
he
reproduced
the
ancient
aegean
practice
of
tying
the
ends
of
the
longitudinal
wales
together
at
the
stern
then
letting
them
extend
on
behind
the
ship
and
splay
outward
like
the
tail
feathers
of
some
magnificent
phoenix
although
he
loved
the
beauty
of
it
now
that
tail
was
catching
the
wind
and
making
steering
even
tougher
probably
should
have
left
the
damn
thing
off
he
often
lectured
himself
but
no
ii
to
be
exactly
authentic
or
what
was
the
point
no
guts
no
glory
the
ancient
greeks
were
the
astronauts
of
their
age
the
aegean
their
universe
and
he
wanted
to
recapture
the
triumphs
and
the
fears
of
homer
time
if
only
for
a
fortnight
sir
we
got
an
rq
from
the
glover
alfred
konwitz
a
oklahoman
with
a
waist
and
known
to
the
evening
radio
shift
affectionately
as
big
al
lifted
off
his
headphones
and
reached
for
his
coffee
extra
cream
and
sugar
which
he
kept
in
a
special
thermos
cup
the
united
states
has
two
bases
on
the
southern
mediterranean
island
of
crete
strategically
close
to
libya
and
the
middle
east
in
general
they
are
the
naval
and
air
base
at
souda
bay
which
is
large
enough
to
accommodate
the
entire
mediterranean
sixth
fleet
and
the
communications
base
at
gournes
in
the
southern
outskirts
of
iraklion
crete
capital
city
he
and
staff
sergeant
jack
mulhoney
were
at
gournes
on
the
fourth
floor
of
the
faceless
gray
building
that
housed
operations
for
the
massive
battery
of
antennas
they
both
knew
the
glover
was
a
class
frigate
technically
part
of
the
sixth
fleet
on
a
routine
but
classified
assignment
a
hundred
kilometers
northwest
of
souda
bay
they
got
an
israeli
chopper
mayday
konwitz
continued
they
need
a
verify
see
if
it
a
scheduled
op
or
what
jack
mulhoney
was
busy
with
paperwork
more
damned
forms
every
day
and
did
not
really
want
to
be
bothered
he
got
off
at
midnight
and
the
staff
officer
had
ordered
it
completed
and
on
his
desk
by
god
by
tomorrow
or
else
run
it
by
traffic
he
said
without
looking
up
forms
maybe
it
some
exercise
you
could
call
down
to
the
mole
and
see
if
it
on
his
schedule
the
mole
was
charlie
molinsky
who
ran
the
traffic
section
on
the
second
floor
if
the
israeli
chopper
was
on
a
regular
op
he
would
have
it
in
the
computer
roger
konwitz
punched
in
the
number
and
asked
molinsky
to
check
it
out
as
he
waited
he
found
himself
wishing
he
were
back
in
oklahoma
hunting
deer
on
his
uncle
ranch
they
were
as
thick
as
jackrabbits
he
only
had
six
months
more
to
go
and
he
could
not
wait
to
get
out
he
had
joined
at
age
seventeen
to
get
a
crack
at
electronics
and
true
to
its
word
the
navy
came
through
when
he
got
out
he
was
going
to
open
his
own
shop
and
get
rich
fixing
vcrs
hell
everybody
who
had
one
was
always
saying
how
they
broke
down
all
the
time
and
how
much
they
cost
to
fix
who
said
the
japs
did
create
jobs
in
america
suddenly
he
came
alive
he
got
a
negative
sir
he
asking
if
we
could
get
glover
to
reconfirm
christ
switch
me
on
mulhoney
shoved
aside
the
pile
of
paper
and
reached
for
his
headset
glover
this
is
gournes
do
you
copy
over
he
listened
a
second
then
continued
roger
we
have
no
id
on
that
bogey
repeat
negative
id
can
you
reconfirm
while
he
was
waiting
he
punched
up
a
computer
screen
and
studied
it
the
glover
had
reported
a
position
at
latitude
and
longitude
at
hours
and
their
bearing
was
last
reported
to
be
zero
nothing
else
was
in
the
vicinity
damn
he
did
like
the
feel
of
this
one
his
instincts
were
telling
him
something
was
wrong
then
his
headphones
crackled
verified
iff
definitely
israeli
code
do
you
copy
i
copy
but
i
do
buy
it
proceed
with
caution
configure
for
a
bogey
unless
you
can
get
a
good
visual
roger
but
can
you
get
through
to
israeli
control
there
a
hell
of
a
storm
coming
down
out
here
right
now
and
visuals
do
really
cut
it
i
copy
you
glover
hang
on
and
we
try
to
get
something
for
you
he
flipped
off
the
headset
and
revolved
in
his
chair
concern
seeping
into
his
ruddy
features
al
see
if
the
people
downstairs
can
get
through
on
their
hot
line
to
israeli
air
control
military
ask
them
if
they
know
anything
about
a
chopper
in
the
vicinity
of
the
glover
tell
them
we
need
a
response
now
priority
could
be
we
got
a
bogey
closing
on
one
of
ours
maybe
using
a
phony
iff
i
want
them
to
clear
it
aye
aye
sir
he
said
crisply
then
reached
for
the
phone
again
he
spoke
quickly
then
waited
drumming
his
fingers
on
the
vinyl
desk
as
another
gust
hit
vance
glanced
up
at
the
rigging
praying
it
would
hang
together
instead
of
canvas
the
wide
shallow
square
sail
was
made
of
small
linen
cloths
sewn
together
like
those
made
on
the
tiny
looms
of
ancient
times
it
was
a
reefing
sail
invented
just
in
time
for
the
trojan
war
with
an
upper
yard
fitted
with
a
system
of
lines
whereby
it
could
be
furled
up
and
then
secured
aloft
when
he
got
south
of
the
island
and
hove
to
he
would
drop
the
sea
anchor
and
reef
her
but
for
now
he
wanted
every
square
inch
he
was
tired
and
thirsty
but
he
had
no
time
for
even
a
sip
of
water
with
the
sea
rising
waves
were
pounding
over
the
primitive
sideboards
and
soaking
him
to
the
skin
next
the
squalls
would
come
though
maybe
a
little
rain
would
feel
good
improve
the
personal
hygiene
he
was
used
to
problems
for
the
past
five
years
he
had
operated
a
charter
sail
business
out
of
nassau
the
bahamas
living
aboard
one
of
the
vessels
a
bristol
christened
in
fact
this
whole
enterprise
had
begun
there
when
after
a
day
of
sailing
he
and
bill
bates
were
unwinding
over
drinks
one
hot
and
humid
afternoon
at
a
club
near
the
hurricane
hole
marina
vance
attired
in
shorts
and
a
his
standard
sailing
outfit
was
sipping
his
sauza
tres
generaciones
tequila
and
feeling
great
you
know
bill
i
been
thinking
he
had
said
i
want
to
try
something
that
never
been
done
before
what
you
mean
try
paying
your
bills
on
time
bates
had
laughed
knowing
vance
seemed
to
have
a
perennial
problem
very
funny
he
had
ignored
the
crack
and
swirled
the
ice
in
his
glass
then
pulled
out
a
piece
to
chew
no
this
is
serious
ever
check
out
the
paintings
of
the
early
ships
on
greek
vases
ca
say
as
i
have
bates
had
reached
down
and
was
brushing
a
fleck
of
dirt
off
his
perfectly
white
leather
sperry
as
always
his
pale
blue
polo
blazer
remained
crisp
his
west
marine
weatherbeater
cap
immaculate
well
hear
this
out
i
think
there
enough
detail
in
some
of
the
pictures
i
seen
to
actually
one
and
i
checked
it
out
there
also
a
pretty
good
description
of
one
in
the
bates
had
looked
up
from
his
bacardi
and
perrier
so
you
want
to
try
and
build
not
just
build
one
anybody
could
do
that
he
had
leaned
back
hoping
to
add
a
touch
of
drama
to
what
was
next
i
want
to
sail
one
through
the
aegean
do
a
rerun
of
the
the
classic
quest
get
serious
bates
laughed
could
be
more
i
want
to
build
one
single
mast
square
sail
and
go
for
it
recreate
ulysses
and
no
nav
gear
just
the
stars
but
what
route
would
you
take
bill
was
digging
into
the
pocket
of
his
blazer
for
a
weathered
briar
pipe
does
anybody
really
know
i
looked
into
it
and
just
about
everything
homer
talked
about
has
been
located
in
some
place
or
another
we
know
exactly
where
the
site
of
troy
was
so
that
be
the
spot
to
push
off
starting
at
the
dardanelles
strait
ulysses
first
went
north
and
sacked
a
city
on
the
coast
of
thrace
then
he
took
a
heading
almost
due
south
passing
through
the
cyclades
islands
and
by
the
north
side
of
crete
then
put
in
at
the
north
shore
of
africa
where
so
you
intend
to
do
it
by
the
book
bates
had
interjected
only
way
he
had
sipped
his
tequila
feeling
his
excitement
growing
then
continued
from
there
it
up
to
the
western
tip
of
sicily
polyphemus
land
then
northwest
to
sardinia
then
over
to
italy
and
down
the
west
coast
where
ulysses
ran
afoul
of
circe
next
it
south
past
the
galli
islands
where
the
sirens
sang
after
which
i
make
the
straits
of
messina
and
down
to
malta
the
island
of
calypso
finally
it
northeast
to
corfu
and
from
there
it
be
a
straight
shot
on
down
to
ithaca
home
plate
you
never
make
it
bill
was
thoughtfully
filling
his
pipe
bet
you
ten
grand
i
can
do
it
in
a
fortnight
i
probably
never
see
the
money
but
you
on
bates
had
grabbed
the
bet
with
a
big
winner
grin
so
far
it
had
gone
virtually
without
a
hitch
using
old
paintings
he
had
worked
up
precise
engineering
drawings
for
the
vessel
then
engaged
with
a
small
shipyard
in
istanbul
to
build
it
the
turkish
workers
could
scarcely
believe
their
eyes
the
ship
was
a
greek
vase
come
to
life
and
already
the
world
press
had
given
him
plenty
of
coverage
everybody
liked
the
idea
of
a
long
shot
he
had
taken
plenty
of
long
shots
sailing
the
caribbean
over
the
last
eight
years
but
he
had
no
experience
with
an
early
october
storm
in
the
aegean
tonight
was
building
into
a
serious
problem
all
signs
pointed
to
a
typical
autumn
blowout
he
glanced
at
the
clouds
moving
in
from
the
north
darkening
the
sky
and
building
rapidly
he
knew
that
in
these
waters
light
autumn
breezes
could
easily
whip
into
thrashing
gales
yeah
bill
radar
was
right
the
weather
was
real
and
it
scared
him
a
lot
well
he
figured
it
was
time
he
had
been
lucky
so
far
the
ross
dsc
radio
still
worked
and
the
patchwork
sail
had
ripped
yet
then
it
happened
the
nightmare
without
warning
the
winds
suddenly
changed
around
to
the
north
going
from
thirty
knots
to
sixty
in
what
seemed
only
a
second
as
the
linen
sail
strained
he
threw
his
weight
against
the
tiller
hoping
to
hold
his
course
now
more
than
ever
with
the
storm
on
him
he
wanted
to
keep
on
all
his
canvas
and
try
to
get
into
the
lee
of
the
island
as
soon
as
possible
it
was
definitely
time
to
cut
the
bravado
and
start
thinking
about
the
sea
anchor
come
in
the
radio
crackled
and
he
recognized
voice
once
more
do
you
read
he
reached
down
and
picked
up
the
small
black
mike
then
yelled
against
the
howl
of
wind
i
copy
you
but
make
this
quick
no
time
to
chat
i
had
another
at
the
radar
mike
and
i
just
noticed
something
else
you
should
know
about
we
show
you
at
almost
the
same
position
as
a
navy
ship
of
some
kind
part
of
the
sixth
fleet
probably
take
care
you
miss
her
he
clicked
the
mike
to
transmit
this
time
he
did
want
to
bother
switching
channels
some
kind
of
exercise
probably
her
class
ca
tell
but
she
still
a
hell
of
a
lot
bigger
than
you
are
pal
they
may
pick
you
up
on
their
radar
but
again
maybe
not
just
take
care
i
keep
an
eye
out
for
lights
thanks
he
clicked
off
the
mike
again
then
looked
around
but
the
aegean
what
he
could
see
of
it
remained
dark
and
empty
somehow
though
the
black
made
it
just
that
much
scarier
he
leaned
back
into
the
tiller
still
trying
to
hold
as
much
of
the
wind
in
the
sail
as
possible
the
waves
were
lashing
him
now
cold
and
relentless
and
ii
beginning
to
heel
precariously
forcing
him
to
apply
helm
throwing
his
full
hundred
and
eighty
pounds
against
the
heavy
wooden
portside
tiller
it
was
one
of
a
pair
port
and
starboard
the
old
greek
idea
being
that
whenever
a
ship
leaned
away
from
the
wind
lifting
the
windward
rudder
out
of
the
water
the
helmsman
still
had
a
lee
rudder
for
control
but
when
he
took
her
to
starboard
and
tried
to
round
the
island
the
wind
and
tides
would
be
full
abeam
with
a
vessel
like
this
that
was
going
to
be
dicey
he
reached
for
the
life
jacket
he
had
secured
to
the
mast
a
new
switlik
fastnet
crew
vest
normally
he
did
not
bother
but
this
was
not
the
time
to
go
macho
it
had
a
buoyancy
and
a
pound
breaking
strength
enough
for
any
seas
now
the
wind
was
gusting
even
harder
kicking
up
yet
more
swell
the
aegean
sunset
was
concluding
its
red
clouds
turned
purple
and
darkening
fast
a
presage
that
visibility
would
shortly
be
a
thing
of
the
past
the
past
la
recherche
du
temps
this
trip
regardless
of
his
bet
with
bill
was
also
about
recent
times
gone
by
his
father
had
died
the
revered
michael
vance
the
undisputed
grand
old
man
of
archaeology
at
penn
it
turned
out
to
be
a
far
greater
loss
than
he
had
anticipated
like
a
chunk
of
himself
torn
away
he
still
missed
their
discussions
heated
arguments
really
he
had
been
trying
to
wrench
away
the
future
the
old
man
trying
to
hang
on
to
what
he
knew
best
the
past
it
had
been
a
dynamic
tension
filled
with
mutual
love
and
now
he
felt
guilty
but
why
there
was
no
reason
he
also
had
gone
through
another
of
life
milestones
a
divorce
eva
borodin
a
daughter
of
russian
aristocracy
a
college
sweetheart
had
come
back
into
his
life
after
a
digression
of
ten
years
the
second
time
around
was
supposed
to
be
a
charm
right
the
soap
operas
were
wrong
on
that
one
the
same
way
they
were
about
most
other
things
in
real
life
although
the
divorce
now
a
year
ago
had
been
businesslike
and
amicable
it
still
had
hurt
for
the
past
year
he
had
been
sitting
around
and
brooding
about
life
love
middle
age
death
he
still
found
himself
wearing
his
wedding
ring
why
it
just
made
him
think
of
her
even
more
no
the
truth
was
everything
reminded
him
of
her
and
how
much
he
needed
her
what
he
had
not
realized
until
she
was
gone
was
that
needing
somebody
was
the
richest
experience
of
life
he
sighed
into
the
wind
the
challenge
of
his
enterprise
was
supposed
to
take
his
mind
off
all
that
was
it
working
maybe
but
so
far
the
jury
was
still
out
he
gripped
the
tiller
harder
and
glanced
up
at
the
sail
running
downwind
the
cutwater
on
the
bow
was
going
to
be
a
real
problem
but
just
another
half
hour
probably
and
christ
bill
warning
was
on
the
mark
a
massive
hulk
loomed
dead
ahead
running
with
no
lights
it
was
as
long
as
a
football
field
the
bow
towering
up
like
a
battering
ram
she
was
moving
in
off
his
portside
stern
he
guessed
she
was
making
at
least
fifteen
knots
high
above
the
bridge
antennas
and
communications
gear
showed
faintly
against
the
twilight
gloom
gray
and
huge
not
recommended
for
close
encounters
but
he
still
had
time
to
tack
and
give
her
a
wide
berth
he
threw
his
weight
against
the
tiller
veering
to
leeward
once
clear
he
would
bring
the
bow
about
and
let
the
cutwater
top
her
wake
like
a
surfboard
keeping
him
from
taking
water
then
he
would
be
on
his
way
into
the
storm
and
the
night
maybe
he
did
not
even
have
a
problem
they
probably
had
picked
him
up
on
their
radar
by
now
it
did
not
mean
they
would
veer
off
course
but
they
might
throttle
her
down
a
few
notches
just
to
be
neighborly
he
was
still
leaning
on
the
tiller
watching
the
monolithic
hulk
skim
silently
past
when
he
noticed
a
throaty
roar
beginning
to
drown
out
the
slap
of
the
ship
wake
against
the
side
of
after
a
few
moments
as
it
grew
in
ominous
intensity
he
realized
it
was
coming
in
from
the
south
what
in
hell
he
whirled
to
look
and
spotted
a
chopper
altitude
about
eight
hundred
meters
what
was
it
doing
here
had
bill
been
that
worried
enough
to
risk
sending
his
hot
new
agusta
mark
out
in
this
weather
to
no
it
was
way
too
big
when
he
finally
saw
it
clearly
the
stubby
wings
and
rocket
pods
he
realized
it
was
a
soviet
a
hind
over
the
mottled
camouflage
paint
he
discerned
the
blue
star
and
white
background
of
the
israeli
air
force
odd
he
knew
they
had
captured
one
once
an
export
model
from
the
syrian
air
force
but
they
would
never
fly
it
this
far
into
international
airspace
it
was
a
prize
what
more
this
bird
was
fully
armed
with
dual
missiles
secured
at
the
tips
of
each
stubby
wing
just
beyond
the
twin
rocket
pods
then
it
assumed
an
attack
mode
sabri
ramirez
stepped
down
to
the
weapons
station
again
gazed
out
through
the
huge
bubble
and
smiled
shut
down
the
radar
their
iwb
must
not
have
any
reason
for
alarm
they
probably
running
our
iff
through
gournes
right
now
the
israeli
nodded
then
reached
over
to
switch
off
all
systems
that
the
americans
might
interpret
as
weapons
guidance
next
he
clicked
on
the
tv
unlike
radar
it
was
a
passive
system
that
would
not
alert
the
ship
that
she
was
being
ranged
ramirez
pictured
the
control
room
of
the
uss
glover
crowded
with
curious
young
seamen
glued
to
their
monitoring
screens
probably
happy
to
have
a
little
excitement
their
iff
would
be
reporting
an
israeli
chopper
but
the
minute
the
visual
id
came
through
all
hell
would
break
loose
so
far
he
told
himself
it
had
been
a
textbook
approach
airspeed
was
down
to
knots
altitude
eight
hundred
meters
carefully
carefully
first
rule
do
spook
the
quarry
we
do
need
radar
we
be
passive
no
ecm
they
can
throw
at
us
will
make
any
difference
under
two
minutes
now
he
said
it
time
no

no
gain
peretz
flipped

we

suddenly
another
voice
came
on
the
radio
it
was
older
israeli
hawk
one
this
is
tactical
action
officer
vince
bradley
who
the
hell
are
you
we
vid
you
as
a
gunship
peretz
had
switched
off
his
mike
and
was
loosening
his
helmet
strap
you
got
it
right
asshole
watched
as
the
hind
approached
on
the
starboard
side
of
the
destroyer
heading
straight
for
it
and
dropping
altitude
what
in
hell
was
going
on
he
lunged
for
the
radio
and
switched
it
to
the
military
emergency
frequency
hoping
to
pick
up
some
clue
that
would
explain
it
all
probably
not
much
of
a
chance
if
this
was
a
sixth
fleet
operation
they
would
be
scrambling
everything
nothing
so
he
flipped
over
and
started
scanning
the
navy
tracking
frequencies
through
megahertz
in
the
meantime
trying
to
keep
the
tiller
in
hand
the
radio
was
alive
agitated
voices
yelling
back
and
forth
it
was
an
argument
the
helo
claiming
it
was
making
a
flyby
for
an
emergency
ditch
the
frigate
not
exactly
buying
the
story
no
kidding
he
checked
out
the
chopper
in
as
she
came
over
and
he
seen
nothing
wrong
everything
looked
to
be
in
perfect
working
order
the
only
obvious
thing
out
of
the
ordinary
was
that
she
was
fully
armed
whoever
was
flying
her
was
using
some
kind
of
bogus
mayday
to
get
in
close
but
by
now
it
was
too
late
to
try
and
give
the
frigate
a
warning
perfect
timing
ramirez
said
moving
down
to
the
weapons
station
and
taking
peretz
place
we
inside
seconds
now
just
keep
her
on
the
deck
first
we
neutralize
the
forward
gun
turret
taking
airspeed
to
fifty
knots
salim
was
praying
now
uss
glover
ramirez
had
switched
on
the
helmet
mike
again
we
have
a
confirmed
ditch
oil
pressure
just
went
entirely
we
be
taking
her
by
the
bow
i
repeat
who
the
hell
are
you
the
tao
voice
came
back
on
the
radio
we
still
have
no
confirm
on
your
iff
if
you
make
a
pass
assume
hostile
intent
sorry
no
time
to
play
this
by
the
book
he
replied
ditching
he
immediately
clicked
on
the
radar
in
less
than
ten
seconds
he
be
in
position
to
lay
a
swatter
directly
into
the
forward
gun
turret
command
on
the
it
and
at
that
moment
the
gun
was
swiveling
coming
around
suddenly
a
blaze
streaked
past
them
in
the
sky
as
the
forward
gun
fired
and
a
telltale
tracer
ripped
by
it
was
intended
as
a
warning
but
now
the
gun
glowed
on
the
ir
interrogation
screen
thank
you
very
much
ramirez
thought
and
flipped
a
switch
activating
the
starboard
swatter
guidance
system
right
alfred
konwitz
snapped
to
attention
yes
sir
he
slammed
down
the
phone
and
whirled
around
to
jack
mulhoney
full
denial
sir
israeli
control
says
they
have
no
military
aircraft
operating
anywhere
in
that
sector
of
the
aegean
they
that
class
a
hard
we
in
the
shit
some
son
of
a
bitch
is
closing
on
one
of
ours
and
we
do
even
know
who
he
is
he
picked
up
the
headphones
then
switched
on
the
scrambler
do
you
read
me
i
think
it
a
bogey
i
ca
tell
you
that
officially
but
you
better
alert
your
tao
in
the
next
five
seconds
or
it
be
your
ass
sailor
this
is
bradley
came
back
a
new
voice
we
just
jesus
what
hostile
action
do
you
copy
we
got
a
hostile
how
many
it
visual
id
as
a
russian
mi
with
israeli
markings
taking
fire
forward
what
are
sounds
behind
the
radio
voice
had
erupted
in
turmoil
something
catastrophic
was
going
on
al
he
turned
quickly
get
command
i
think
we
got
an
id
hind
taking
hostile
action
on
the
he
did
realize
it
but
with
those
words
he
had
played
directly
into
sabri
ramirez
hands
the
scenario
was
now
a
lock
when
jack
mulhoney
turned
back
to
his
radio
he
only
heard
static
vance
watched
as
the
frigate
got
off
a
warning
tracer
but
to
no
effect
the
hind
ignored
it
as
a
stream
of
rockets
from
under
the
chopper
stubby
starboard
wing
flared
down
while
the
machine
gun
beneath
the
nose
opened
fire
then
the
weapons
operator
on
the
hind
loosed
a
swatter
and
an
instant
later
flames
erupted
on
the
frigate
bow
an
orange
and
black
ball
where
the
forward
gun
turret
had
been
as
it
spiraled
upward
into
the
night
the
turret
and
its
magazine
exploded
like
a
giant
motion
cherry
bomb
he
could
see
sailors
running
down
the
decks
could
hear
the
sound
of
a
shipboard
fire
alarm
going
off
the
dull
horn
used
for
emergencies
they
were
calling
all
hands
to
station
but
their
response
had
come
too
late
the
approach
had
caught
the
navy
off
guard
its
defenses
down
the
radio
crackled
alive
with
a
mayday
were
there
any
other
ships
in
the
area
he
wondered
anybody
to
take
out
the
bastards
in
the
chopper
now
it
was
banking
coming
around
bringing
the
frigate
stern
into
its
deadly
view
then
a
blaze
of
rockets
poured
in
engulfing
the
communications
gear
and
antennas
next
the
weapons
operator
loosed
a
second
swatter
directly
into
the
bridge
christ
seconds
later
it
had
transformed
the
midsection
of
the
frigate
into
a
ball
of
fire
he
watched
aghast
as
the
blast
flung
the
men
on
the
bridge
outward
through
the
glass
partition
he
plunged
for
cover
just
as
the
first
airborne
shock
wave
ripped
ii
sail
loose
from
its
lines
when
he
rose
to
try
and
grab
the
starboard
tiller
a
second
shock
wave
caught
him
and
flung
him
savagely
against
the
mast
the
next
thing
he
knew
he
was
clinging
to
the
portside
gunwale
one
hand
still
tangled
in
the
lines
that
had
been
ripped
from
the
sail
the
night
sky
had
turned
a
blood
red
reflecting
down
off
the
clouds
then
he
felt
a
tremor
in
the
hull
as
a
massive
wave
caught
him
and
the
pegs
that
held
the
stern
together
so
lovingly
installed
sheared
the
aft
section
of
instantaneously
began
to
come
apart
the
light
woods
would
float
she
was
after
all
hardly
more
than
a
raft
with
sides
but
she
would
be
helpless
his
handmade
marvel
had
been
reduced
to
a
bundle
of
planks
barely
holding
together
sail
in
shreds
twin
rudders
demolished
for
a
moment
he
counted
himself
lucky
his
body
unscathed
he
probably
could
weather
the
storm
by
just
hanging
on
then
it
happened
whether
through
luck
or
skill
the
chopper
weapons
operator
laid
another
one
of
the
swatter
missiles
into
the
stern
section
causing
a
massive
secondary
explosion
a
billowing
ball
of
fire
that
punched
out
near
the
waterline
this
time
he
knew
a
wall
of
water
would
come
bearing
down
on
him
sending
a
terminal
shock
wave
through
what
was
left
of
you
got
to
try
and
keep
her
aright
he
told
himself
try
and
lash
yourself
down
with
one
of
the
lines
the
wall
of
water
hit
hurtling
him
over
the
side
he
grasped
for
a
section
of
gunwale
but
it
was
too
late
the
wave
obliterated
everything
now
the
swell
was
churning
against
his
face
as
he
tried
to
stroke
back
his
lungs
filling
with
water
his
arms
were
flailing
hands
trying
desperately
to
grasp
the
slippery
cypress
planking
the
switlik
vest
was
holding
so
he
was
in
no
danger
of
drowning
yet
fighting
the
swell
with
his
left
hand
spitting
water
he
reached
out
with
his
right
trying
to
catch
any
piece
of
wreckage
floating
by
finally
he
succeeded
in
wrapping
a
line
around
his
wrist
he
gasped
choking
and
caught
his
breath
then
still
grasping
the
line
he
draped
his
left
arm
across
ii
side
and
used
the
line
to
pull
himself
over
into
what
was
left
of
the
hold
if
he
could
stay
with
her
he
figured
he
might
still
have
a
chance
just
as
he
tried
to
rise
to
his
feet
however
he
looked
up
to
see
the
mast
slowly
heeling
over
coming
straight
down
he
toppled
backward
hoping
to
dodge
it
but
it
slammed
him
just
across
the
chest
the
world
swirled
into
blackness
as
even
the
light
from
the
blazing
ship
behind
him
seemed
to
flicker
stay
conscious
he
told
himself
stay
alive
holding
onto
the
toppled
mast
using
it
as
a
brace
he
managed
to
rise
and
now
the
hind
had
completed
its
gruesome
handiwork
and
was
banking
again
it
was
going
to
pass
directly
overhead
by
god
he
thought
this
thing
is
over
those
bastards
are
not
going
to
get
off
you
used
the
swatters
salim
was
shoving
the
throttle
levers
forward
as
he
banked
his
voice
was
incredulous
you
said
we
were
just
going
to
disable
the
trsscomm
system
and
the
radars
with
rockets
trsscomm
was
short
for
technical
research
ship
special
communications
the
frigate
was
equipped
with
batteries
of
listening
antennas
an
elaborate
system
of
sensors
and
sophisticated
computers
and
various
hydraulic
systems
on
the
stern
needed
to
twist
and
turn
the
various
dishes
but
it
also
was
manned
what
was
the
point
of
mass
murder
ramirez
had
explained
that
the
a
spy
ship
that
worked
for
the
national
security
agency
the
nsa
normally
it
operated
within
a
small
region
in
a
special
hearability
area
just
off
crete
where
a
fluke
in
the
weather
allowed
it
to
eavesdrop
on
all
the
middle
east
the
crew
could
even
watch
cairo
television
salim
was
stunned
ramirez
he
had
suddenly
realized
was
a
madman
it
was
one
thing
to
require
an
occasional
killing
in
an
operation
this
complex
after
all
he
had
had
to
shoot
his
weapons
operator
in
order
to
steal
the
hind
but
an
attack
on
a
frigate
was
pointless
the
stakes
had
just
gone
through
the
roof
however
salim
younger
brother
jamal
had
exactly
the
opposite
reaction
with
a
surge
of
pride
he
exclaimed
praise
be
to
god
and
fell
to
his
knees
on
the
rear
litter
this
was
a
leader
he
would
follow
anywhere
the
others
did
not
share
jamal
joy
they
considered
themselves
professionals
and
overkill
was
not
businesslike
however
they
merely
glanced
at
each
other
and
kept
silent
squabbling
with
ramirez
served
no
purpose
we
were
only
going
to
take
out
their
tracking
capability
salim
said
again
his
anger
growing
it
time
you
understood
something
ramirez
handed
his
headset
to
the
israeli
dore
peretz
and
stepped
up
from
the
weapons
station
his
voice
sounding
above
the
roar
of
the
engines
i
am
in
charge
of
this
operation
if
i
think
an
action
is
necessary
i
will
take
it
does
anyone
here
want
to
disagree
the
question
was
answered
with
silence
he
had
just
killed
dozens
of
men
they
all
knew
one
more
would
hardly
matter
vance
pulled
himself
across
the
planking
and
stretched
for
a
box
of
gear
stowed
beneath
the
stern
platform
in
it
was
a
constant
traveling
companion
his
walther
although
the
concept
of
downing
a
hind
gunship
with
fire
had
been
tested
in
afghanistan
and
found
wanting
he
was
so
angry
his
better
judgment
was
not
fully
in
play
the
pistol
remained
in
its
waterproof
case
quickly
he
took
it
out
unwrapped
it
and
clicked
a
round
into
the
chamber
then
he
tried
to
steady
himself
against
the
fallen
mast
the
hind
was
about
a
hundred
meters
away
now
coming
in
low
were
they
going
to
strafe
no
they
probably
did
realize
he
was
there
they
were
about
to
be
in
for
a
surprise
he
could
see
the
operator
inside
the
lower
bulletproof
bubble
forget
it
and
the
pilot
seated
just
above
him
was
similarly
invulnerable
no
way
furthermore
the
dual
rocket
pods
beneath
each
short
wing
were
probably
armored
again
no
vulnerability
aside
from
the
poorly
protected
gas
tanks
there
was
only
one
point
worth
the
trouble
if
it
was
about
to
pass
directly
overhead
and
he
saw
that
he
was
going
to
be
lucky
one
swatter
missile
remained
secured
on
the
hardpoint
tip
of
the
stubby
starboard
wing
it
was
the
only
shot
he
had
but
if
he
did
get
it
they
would
get
him
one
touch
of
the
red
firing
button
by
the
weapons
operator
and
would
be
evaporated
he
took
careful
aim
at
the
small
white
tube
on
the
wing
still
nestled
on
its
launcher
and
squeezed
off
a
round
but
at
that
instant
dipped
in
the
swell
and
he
saw
sparks
fly
off
the
fuselage
instead
the
chopper
passed
blissfully
overhead
its
engine
a
dull
roar
above
the
howl
of
the
sea
we
taking
fire
peretz
shouted
from
the
weapons
station
down
below
what
that
impossible
ramirez
whirled
then
stepped
in
behind
him
to
look
lights
from
the
control
panel
winked
over
his
shoulders
while
below
them
the
aegean
was
dark
and
gray
check
the
radar
peretz
flipped
a
switch
on
his
left
and
scanned
the
screen
something
down
there
maybe
a
fishing
idiot
nobody
fishing
here
now
not
with
this
weather
he
looked
up
and
shouted
to
the
cockpit
salim
take
her
about
and
we
strafe
the
son
of
a
bitch
the
nose
cannon
was
slaved
to
the
radar
another
of
the
many
and
lethal
features
while
ramirez
watched
he
would
have
moved
back
into
the
gunnery
seat
himself
but
there
was
no
time
dore
peretz
switched
on
the
nose
cannon
when
the
target
locked
on
the
radar
he
pushed
the
fire
control
under
his
right
hand
a
flare
of
fire
hopping
across
the
churning
sea
caught
the
side
of
and
sprayed
flecks
of
wood
around
him
but
the
swell
was
making
him
an
elusive
target
the
line
of
fire
had
not
really
done
any
damage
not
this
time
they
knew
he
was
there
though
now
the
chopper
was
banking
and
returning
for
another
pass
maybe
he
thought
they
going
to
stick
with
the
nose
cannon
they
wo
bother
wasting
rockets
or
a
swatter
missile
on
the
wreckage
of
a
raft
the
bastards
are
just
having
some
target
practice
a
little
fun
and
games
he
saw
the
flames
from
the
nose
cannon
begin
as
the
massive
hind
started
its
second
pass
this
was
it
ii
about
to
be
history
but
not
before
he
gave
her
one
last
blaze
of
glory
holding
to
the
gunwale
and
readying
himself
he
took
careful
aim
at
the
starboard
swatter
still
perched
like
a
thin
white
bird
on
the
stubby
wingtip
he
steadied
the
walther
on
semiautomatic
and
began
firing
oblivious
to
the
line
of
strafing
coming
his
way
he
saw
the
rounds
glancing
off
the
armored
wing
and
the
sparks
guided
his
aim
the
clip
was
going
fast
but
then
bingo
a
flare
erupted
then
an
orange
fireball
neatly
severing
the
starboard
wingtip
the
missile
had
detonated
but
just
as
it
did
the
strafing
caught
right
down
the
middle
shearing
her
in
half
stabilize
her
peretz
felt
himself
flung
against
the
bulletproof
bubble
that
shielded
the
weapons
station
a
blinding
explosion
jolted
the
hind
and
the
accompanying
shock
wave
from
the
detonating
swatter
spun
it
around
thirty
degrees
several
gauges
in
the
instrument
panel
had
veered
off
scale
salim
reached
up
and
cut
the
power
to
the
main
rotor
then
eased
the
column
and
grabbed
the
collective
pitch
lever
with
his
left
hand
in
less
than
a
second
the
hind
had
righted
herself
slowly
the
instruments
began
coming
back
as
the
electrical
system
recovered
from
the
impact
tail
rotor
okay
he
reported
checking
the
panel
altimeter
reads
five
hundred
meters
he
looked
up
what
in
the
name
of
god
happened
our
last
swatter
detonated
the
question
is
why
ramirez
answered
he
was
staring
angrily
out
the
plastic
of
his
bubble
at
the
wreckage
of
the
starboard
wing
dore
peretz
now
in
the
weapons
station
in
the
nose
was
talking
to
himself
i
got
the
bastard
shoved
the
walther
into
his
belt
and
dove
into
the
swell
the
cold
waters
crashing
against
his
face
the
ii
reduced
to
debris
his
labor
of
love
half
a
year
work
all
evaporated
in
an
instant
the
zen
masters
were
right
never
get
attached
to
physical
things
he
avoided
the
deadly
shards
of
wood
then
seized
onto
a
section
of
the
mast
that
had
blown
in
his
direction
the
hind
was
banking
and
turning
now
assuming
a
heading
due
south
that
he
realized
was
the
direction
of
andikythera
site
of
satcom
new
complex
was
it
their
next
target
that
did
make
any
sense
bill
project
was
commercial
it
had
no
military
value
or
at
least
none
he
could
imagine
but
now
he
had
only
one
thing
on
his
mind
he
secured
his
life
vest
tighter
and
held
on
to
the
mast
the
salty
aegean
in
his
face
the
current
was
taking
him
due
south
the
same
direction
the
chopper
had
headed
chapter
two
damn
it
ramirez
looked
down
at
the
weapons
readouts
did
you
have
the
swatter
armed
the
system
should
have
been
off
if
it
was
on
he
could
have
detonated
it
by
impact
peretz
stared
a
second
longer
at
the
wreckage
of
the
vessel
below
then
glanced
back
at
his
instruments
and
paled
i
thought
it
was
it
must
have
malfunctioned
no
fucking
way
carelessness
stupid
carelessness
ramirez
bent
his
head
and
examined
the
wing
then
checked
the
status
readouts
on
the
weapons
system
we
lost
the
starboard
rocket
pod
too
peretz
took
one
look
and
realized
it
was
true
the
rocket
pod
had
been
shorn
away
leaving
the
tangled
metal
of
the
wing
completely
bare
but
the
hind
did
not
need
its
wings
for
stability
they
were
merely
for
armaments
well
so
what
i
wasted
the
fucker
whoever
he
was
he
tried
a
smile
sending
a
web
of
lines
through
his
tan
as
the
lights
of
the
weapons
panel
played
across
his
face
it
was
the
way
he
always
disguised
nervousness
damn
you
ramirez
was
thinking
an
israeli
cowboy
i
would
kill
you
on
the
spot
except
that
i
need
you
it
was
an
arrogant
mistake
and
i
ca
let
it
happen
again
it
wo
happen
again
he
turned
and
moved
back
up
to
the
cockpit
what
our
status
sideslip
is
nominal
salim
reported
grimly
his
dark
eyes
glancing
down
at
the
churning
sea
only
a
couple
of
hundred
meters
below
them
i
think
we
going
to
be
all
right
we
have
just
had
an
example
of
how
an
oversight
can
destroy
an
operation
ramirez
declared
turning
back
to
the
main
cabin
we
will
not
succeed
if
we
get
careless
lose
discipline
i
have
planned
this
operation
down
to
the
last
small
detail
you
have
all
been
briefed
over
and
over
he
paused
and
examined
the
men
sometimes
he
felt
as
if
he
were
lecturing
children
but
these
were
no
children
each
of
you
knows
what
his
job
is
i
expect
you
to
do
it
with
exactness
and
precision
the
next
oversight
anyone
here
makes
will
be
his
last
am
i
understood
there
was
silence
then
finally
a
voice
came
from
the
litters
in
the
darkened
cabin
aft
barely
audible
above
the
roar
of
the
twin
engines
it
was
moreau
the
frenchman
he
hated
flying
and
he
particularly
hated
flying
with
an
iranian
at
the
controls
what
the
hell
happened
someone
on
presumably
a
raft
of
some
kind
we
took
a
couple
of
rounds
of
fire
he
glanced
back
making
sure
his
voice
reached
peretz
in
the
weapons
station
the
last
swatter
was
left
turned
on
armed
and
it
must
have
been
hit
probably
the
detonator
a
stupid
oversight
looks
like
the
mistake
was
mine
came
the
voice
of
peretz
trying
unsuccessfully
to
sound
contrite
ca
win
them
all
baby
back
to
his
self
ramirez
thought
still
gritting
his
teeth
in
anger
but
he
pushed
it
aside
forget
it
in
this
business
you
only
look
back
if
you
can
profit
from
your
mistakes
we
just
learned
what
happens
when
we
forget
our
mission
the
matter
is
closed
now
he
returned
his
attention
to
the
main
cabin
when
we
set
down
at
the
facility
i
expect
total
discipline
nothing
less
will
be
tolerated
is
that
understood
he
motioned
peretz
out
of
the
weapons
station
and
took
his
place
there
would
these
men
hold
together
the
way
he
required
as
he
looked
them
over
he
felt
confident
he
had
had
enough
experience
to
smell
success
sabri
ramirez
had
definitely
been
around
the
track
born
in
venezuela
almost
half
a
century
earlier
the
son
of
a
prominent
marxist
lawyer
he
had
become
an
ardent
revolutionary
by
age
twenty
at
he
went
off
to
cuba
but
it
was
only
later
while
attending
patrice
lumumba
university
in
the
soviet
union
that
he
discovered
his
true
ideological
core
it
turned
out
he
actually
despised
the
oppressed
of
the
earth
along
with
curfews
books
and
lectures
no
what
he
really
wanted
to
join
was
not
the
party
but
the
party
good
living
women
fame
and
he
wanted
the
last
most
of
all
after
nine
months
his
lack
of
ideological
fervor
got
him
summarily
expelled
he
actually
felt
relief
with
an
eye
to
where
the
action
was
he
immigrated
to
beirut
and
prudently
became
a
muslim
by
conversion
then
he
started
making
contacts
beirut
had
always
been
a
good
place
to
make
contacts
the
payoff
was
quick
he
was
young
obviously
brilliant
and
he
would
do
anything
in
the
early
he
was
recruited
by
the
terrorist
group
known
as
the
popular
front
for
the
liberation
of
palestine
and
assigned
leadership
of
its
european
unit
off
he
went
to
paris
the
posting
of
his
dreams
he
had
long
fantasized
about
making
himself
a
legend
as
one
of
the
world
leading
terrorists
and
he
was
soon
succeeding
beyond
his
fondest
imaginings
in
he
graduated
from
the
pflp
and
formed
his
own
group
a
middle
eastern
it
was
known
as
the
organization
of
the
armed
arab
struggle
the
designation
he
thought
had
a
nice
revolutionary
ring
which
he
had
long
since
learned
mattered
his
new
enterprise
soon
attracted
such
major
clients
as
libya
and
iraq
among
his
more
celebrated
achievements
were
the
bombing
of
a
french
cultural
center
in
west
berlin
exploding
a
suitcase
bomb
at
a
marseilles
railroad
station
and
placing
an
incendiary
device
aboard
the
french
bullet
train
although
he
never
had
cared
about
ideology
he
appreciated
the
importance
of
a
correct
political
stance
in
the
islamic
world
and
therefore
he
frequently
posed
as
the
leader
of
an
armed
struggle
against
the
zionist
enemy
but
always
however
at
a
profit
he
had
in
fact
perfected
the
fine
art
of
extortion
pressing
the
reactionary
regimes
of
egypt
jordan
kuwait
saudi
arabia
and
the
gulf
sheikdoms
into
paying
protection
money
disguised
as
revolutionary
donations
after
he
engineered
the
opec
incident
in
vienna
in
which
eleven
oil
ministers
were
taken
hostage
and
then
blew
up
a
seaside
resort
killing
a
kuwaiti
official
he
began
receiving
regular
payoffs
from
all
the
gulf
states
finally
in
he
closed
out
operations
under
the
oaas
name
moved
to
damascus
and
began
training
syrian
intelligence
agents
by
that
time
he
had
become
a
chimera
a
legend
whose
nickname
the
hyena
was
linked
to
every
car
bomb
in
europe
and
by
that
time
also
the
hyena
a
name
he
despised
had
become
the
stuff
of
popular
fiction
as
well
as
of
dossiers
on
three
continents
having
reduced
terrorism
to
a
science
a
boring
science
he
then
temporarily
retired
but
now
after
the
american
invasion
of
the
middle
east
he
had
decided
to
come
back
for
one
last
score
to
do
what
he
had
been
dreaming
about
for
years
the
americans
had
unwittingly
provided
the
perfect
opportunity
why
not
seize
it
this
time
however
he
wanted
to
do
it
himself
not
with
an
army
of
radical
muslims
he
stepped
up
to
the
cockpit
and
examined
the
rows
of
gauges
hold
the
airspeed
under
a
hundred
knots
and
make
sure
you
keep
her
on
the
deck
then
he
checked
down
below
peretz
this
time
make
sure
all
the
weapons
stations
are
switched
off
that
the
israeli
nodded
this
time
without
his
usual
grin
now
the
hind
had
begun
its
final
approach
the
tv
showed
a
small
landing
pad
approximately
thirty
meters
on
each
side
with
a
private
helicopter
parked
in
the
middle
of
a
black
and
white
in
the
center
he
knew
that
arm
a
group
he
had
long
hated
had
ringed
the
island
with
a
industrial
security
system
five
years
ago
he
recalled
they
had
killed
three
of
his
operatives
in
beirut
in
a
futile
attempt
to
kill
him
what
more
it
never
made
the
papers
typical
the
security
system
they
had
developed
for
the
island
was
good
but
it
made
no
provision
for
this
kind
of
penetration
it
pleased
him
to
at
last
make
fools
of
them
we
coming
in
salim
announced
he
touched
the
rudder
pedal
with
his
left
foot
to
hold
their
heading
and
grasped
the
collective
pitch
lever
as
he
eased
the
engines
toward
idle
there
already
a
helo
on
the
pad
looks
like
a
new
agusta
i
know
about
it
just
set
down
next
to
it
inside
the
landing
perimeter
i
want
this
to
be
simple
tonight
he
knew
they
had
scheduled
the
first
full
of
the
cyclops
everything
depended
on
how
that
test
went
but
he
postpone
the
takeover
any
longer
this
was
it
abruptly
he
wondered
if
the
damaged
wing
would
affect
stability
on
touchdown
they
would
soon
find
out
the
current
swept
him
inexorably
southward
while
behind
him
the
bundle
of
planks
that
remained
of
was
dispersing
rapidly
he
cursed
himself
for
having
lost
the
ross
dsc
radio
on
the
other
hand
he
considered
himself
lucky
just
to
be
in
one
piece
luckier
than
the
crewmen
of
the
uss
glover
it
was
heartrending
seeing
a
tragedy
coming
and
not
being
able
to
stop
it
that
was
the
worst
possible
nightmare
he
wanted
to
go
back
to
try
and
help
but
the
sea
made
it
impossible
he
pulled
himself
over
the
bobbing
drifting
mast
feeling
it
slam
against
his
face
as
the
sea
tossed
it
like
a
matchstick
all
around
him
lethal
splinters
of
sliced
through
the
water
jagged
spears
driven
by
the
swell
the
dark
engulfed
him
lightened
only
by
the
billowing
remains
of
the
navy
frigate
now
some
thousand
yards
away
somewhere
dear
god
it
got
to
be
somewhere
let
it
still
be
strapped
to
the
mast
the
idea
seemed
stupid
at
the
time
but
now
he
felt
his
way
down
until
his
fingers
touched
a
slippery
nylon
cord
was
it
yes
maybe
there
is
a
god
the
straps
were
tangled
which
was
not
supposed
to
happen
and
fragments
of
cypress
planking
from
the
sides
of
the
ship
had
punctured
the
nylon
cover
but
his
switlik
raft
was
still
dangling
from
the
remains
of
the
mast
now
for
one
more
minor
miracle
could
he
manage
to
pull
it
free
before
everything
disappeared
into
the
dark
and
the
swell
he
flailed
with
one
hand
to
keep
his
head
afloat
while
his
fingers
grappled
with
the
bowline
knot
finally
the
knot
loosened
and
he
wrenched
it
loose
jesus
is
there
going
to
be
anything
left
would
it
still
inflate
he
grappled
with
the
fiberglass
canister
that
contained
the
raft
then
popped
it
open
with
his
last
remaining
strength
he
pulled
on
the
tether
discharging
the
bottled
carbon
dioxide
that
caused
the
switlik
to
hiss
to
life
part
of
it
he
realized
the
lower
buoyancy
tube
had
been
ripped
to
shreds
by
the
machine
gun
of
the
hind
that
had
destroyed
the
mast
but
the
upper
one
had
somehow
escaped
intact
so
he
was
it
was
yellow
hexagonal
and
it
looked
like
heaven
he
had
never
used
one
before
and
he
had
never
realized
how
it
felt
like
an
oversized
inner
tube
with
a
surge
of
relief
he
pulled
himself
aboard
inching
in
as
he
felt
the
swell
pound
over
him
and
then
he
drew
out
the
folding
oars
and
extended
them
with
his
new
course
he
knew
he
would
miss
the
harbor
at
kythera
recommended
by
bates
no
way
could
he
battle
the
current
and
make
it
the
vagaries
of
wind
and
sea
were
driving
him
almost
due
south
it
was
the
direction
the
chopper
had
taken
straight
for
the
little
island
of
andikythera
could
they
breach
satcom
security
and
get
in
probably
the
setup
installed
by
arm
was
only
he
had
cautioned
bill
about
that
he
grimaced
and
plied
his
strength
to
the
two
small
aluminum
oars
the
way
the
wind
and
seas
were
taking
him
he
would
find
out
soon
enough
again
he
lamented
the
loss
of
the
radio
with
it
he
could
get
out
a
mayday
alerting
any
ships
around
that
might
mount
a
rescue
of
the
frigate
survivors
he
also
could
try
warning
the
satcom
facility
that
trouble
was
headed
their
way
the
problem
was
the
hind
had
a
top
speed
of
over
a
hundred
and
fifty
knots
if
andikythera
was
its
destination
it
probably
was
already
there
the
cold
sea
stung
his
face
and
the
tossing
waves
were
making
him
slightly
seasick
but
he
felt
alive
again
almost
by
instinct
he
looked
up
to
try
to
find
the
stars
loving
how
crisp
and
striking
they
could
be
over
the
aegean
nothing
yet
but
there
were
glimmers
in
the
north
a
good
sign
the
storm
was
blowing
over
now
the
clouds
starting
to
open
up
again
if
bill
tries
the
radio
he
probably
figure
i
just
vanished
from
the
earth
he
half
felt
like
it
as
the
cold
autumn
waters
of
the
aegean
surged
around
him
its
waves
washing
over
his
partially
inflated
switlik
he
thought
about
bill
bates
he
was
a
friend
a
very
good
friend
was
he
about
to
be
in
trouble
although
bates
was
a
executive
he
also
was
a
dedicated
family
man
he
had
a
model
wife
back
in
arlington
and
two
model
sons
both
deposited
in
model
private
academies
his
wife
a
blond
wasp
fashioned
enough
to
have
the
same
family
name
as
a
prominent
philadelphia
bank
never
seemed
to
tire
of
her
charity
obligations
so
it
was
his
sons
he
took
with
him
sailing
in
the
summers
that
was
how
vance
had
met
him
sailing
with
the
boys
in
the
bahamas
bill
was
highly
regarded
in
industry
circles
as
the
ceo
ceo
and
not
without
reason
for
one
thing
less
inconsequential
than
most
would
think
he
looked
the
part
his
hair
was
always
trimmed
to
the
precise
millimeter
his
tanned
cheeks
were
forever
sleek
from
a
workout
at
his
club
or
whatever
club
was
handy
on
his
perpetual
travels
he
had
once
claimed
he
knew
the
location
of
more
health
clubs
than
any
man
in
america
best
of
all
though
he
knew
how
to
raise
money
when
he
described
a
pending
enterprise
he
did
it
with
the
gleaming
eye
of
the
true
believer
even
in
a
dicey
investment
environment
he
always
generated
the
enthusiasm
sufficient
to
ensure
that
a
new
stock
issue
sold
out
and
closed
higher
than
the
offering
price
on
the
day
it
was
floated
the
man
could
sell
sunlamps
in
the
sahara
he
competed
hard
in
everything
he
did
when
he
decided
some
years
after
he
and
vance
had
become
acquainted
that
he
wanted
to
spend
summers
racing
he
did
not
bother
buying
his
own
yacht
instead
he
flew
to
nassau
and
leased
the
fastest
boat
he
knew
at
that
moment
the
vessel
filling
that
description
was
the
argonaut
owned
by
windstalker
ltd
it
was
a
sloop
highly
regarded
throughout
the
racing
fraternity
its
owner
however
never
let
any
of
his
three
yachts
out
of
the
harbor
without
first
undertaking
a
personal
checkout
of
the
new
skipper
even
if
it
was
an
old
friend
vance
remembered
it
well
bill
manned
the
helm
a
mahogany
wheel
always
kept
well
polished
and
they
were
making
a
solid
eight
knots
on
the
speedo
it
was
one
of
those
mornings
in
the
islands
when
everything
seemed
as
clear
as
a
desert
sky
no
cruise
ships
were
scheduled
into
the
harbor
and
the
stinkpot
powerboats
were
mercifully
in
limited
supply
the
wind
was
perfect
and
the
water
as
smooth
as
a
glittering
mirror
best
of
all
bates
was
handling
the
helm
as
though
he
had
been
there
all
his
life
think
we
can
get
her
up
to
ten
knots
he
asked
shielding
his
eyes
as
he
studied
the
genoa
a
gleaming
triangle
of
white
above
the
bow
vance
had
leaned
back
and
tested
the
wind
give
her
a
little
touch
on
the
helm
to
starboard
and
i
think
she
might
come
through
for
you
he
was
proud
of
his
recent
refurbishing
of
the
boat
the
latest
northstar
digital
satnav
gear
sails
that
cost
a
fortune
a
complete
renovation
of
the
instrument
station
down
below
bates
tapped
the
wheel
and
the
genoa
bellied
even
more
i
like
this
fucking
boat
a
lot
mike
he
declared
so
here
the
deal
i
want
to
lease
her
for
three
months
take
her
to
norfolk
get
a
crew
together
and
get
everybody
comfortable
with
her
i
think
we
can
talk
vance
had
to
smile
the
yacht
would
be
in
good
hands
and
a
charter
was
a
dream
come
true
for
a
guy
in
his
business
matter
of
fact
i
wanted
to
ask
you
to
help
me
out
with
something
else
too
some
security
work
hey
i
just
a
simple
operator
not
my
line
do
bullshit
me
pal
he
laughed
you
know
satcom
is
building
a
new
industrial
facility
in
the
aegean
a
private
space
facility
i
think
american
technology
is
getting
a
bum
rap
michael
he
said
with
sudden
seriousness
i
plan
to
change
that
the
journal
says
you
want
to
try
and
give
the
europeans
a
run
for
the
roses
he
looked
over
the
wind
whipping
his
glistening
hair
you
keep
in
touch
pretty
damned
good
for
a
simple
sailor
but
i
tell
you
if
we
succeed
we
literally
change
the
way
space
is
used
i
be
able
to
put
a
satellite
into
orbit
for
a
song
just
between
us
i
building
the
biggest
private
spaceport
anywhere
the
french
operation
in
guiana
wo
hold
a
candle
to
it
i
already
got
ten
geostationary
orbital
slots
locked
up
with
the
world
administrative
radio
conference
even
nasa
better
keep
a
grip
on
their
jockstrap
where
the
money
coming
from
the
usual
suspects
who
else
he
laughed
then
tapped
the
helm
slightly
more
to
starboard
the
stock
was
and
it
was
hell
and
gone
in
three
fucking
hours
bang
out
the
door
matter
of
fact
it
now
trading
almost
fifteen
percent
above
the
original
offering
price
he
shrugged
i
should
have
issued
more
but
like
a
stupid
son
of
a
bitch
i
had
a
failure
of
nerve
did
go
with
my
instincts
next
time
how
about
letting
me
in
on
the
action
you
a
goddamn
piece
of
work
michael
and
so
this
boat
tell
you
what
i
make
you
a
deal
i
figure
you
expecting
about
four
thou
a
week
for
this
baby
correct
anything
for
a
friend
right
he
laughed
i
want
her
for
twelve
weeks
so
what
if
i
paid
you
with
some
of
my
personal
satcom
stock
fifty
thou
worth
at
the
current
price
how
that
sound
deal
vance
said
without
hesitation
he
heard
a
lot
of
bull
in
the
charter
business
but
bates
was
a
straight
shooter
the
temporary
gap
in
cash
flow
was
going
to
make
meeting
the
three
mortgages
one
for
each
boat
tough
but
he
liked
the
sound
of
the
project
this
is
going
to
leave
you
strapped
is
it
bates
looked
a
trifle
worried
i
manage
as
i
always
say
two
in
the
bush
is
worth
one
in
the
hand
michael
half
the
time
you
do
have
a
pot
to
piss
in
i
know
that
you
the
lousiest
manager
i
know
he
laughed
out
loud
and
tapped
the
helm
bringing
her
to
port
a
notch
which
is
one
of
the
world
great
ironies
considering
what
you
do
for
arm
you
hear
things
too
he
had
never
really
discussed
his
arm
work
with
bates
you
good
i
know
that
word
gets
around
he
paused
matter
of
fact
i
wanted
to
ask
you
a
favor
i
was
hoping
you
could
work
up
a
contract
for
me
with
your
people
as
i
said
i
need
some
security
for
that
facility
in
greece
what
kind
that
for
your
guys
to
say
it
just
has
to
be
good
we
going
to
be
installing
some
proprietary
technology
that
beyond
anything
that
ever
been
seen
before
and
we
going
to
rock
a
lot
of
boats
in
the
business
there
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
europeans
who
love
to
know
what
we
up
to
there
a
real
chance
of
industrial
espionage
so
what
the
program
perimeter
surveillance
security
guards
we
could
probably
arrange
the
subcontracting
i
appreciate
it
your
guys
know
europe
the
local
scene
i
got
a
feeling
that
going
to
be
important
no
problem
the
truth
was
this
was
exactly
the
kind
of
work
the
boys
at
arm
liked
nobody
shooting
at
you
i
put
in
a
call
to
paris
if
you
like
something
probably
can
be
arranged
good
bates
nodded
as
though
a
handshake
were
already
involved
one
more
thing
off
his
checklist
mainly
i
want
some
stuff
you
know
fences
alarms
that
kind
of
crap
we
got
a
guy
in
athens
who
specializes
in
that
he
wo
give
estimates
over
the
phone
but
if
you
let
him
look
over
the
site
he
price
the
job
for
you
right
down
to
the
drachma
with
various
options
but
you
be
smart
to
go
with
his
recommendation
try
to
nickel
and
dime
him
and
he
walk
i
seen
him
do
it
so
what
this
of
the
line
likely
to
run
me
bates
had
asked
well
there
are
the
systems
you
can
see
and
the
ones
you
ca
laughed
the
ones
you
ca
see
cost
more
i
already
told
you
i
need
the
best
then
you
probably
want
to
go
mad
vance
said
his
eyes
hiding
a
twinkle
what
the
hell
are
you
talking
about
he
looked
over
annoyed
and
puzzled
magnetic
anomaly
detectors
you
bury
special
transmitting
cables
beneath
the
ground
outside
the
perimeter
so
that
they
build
an
invisible
electromagnetic
field
around
and
above
their
location
anything
does
even
have
to
be
metal
that
enters
the
field
will
distort
it
if
you
go
with
the
sentrax
system
made
by
an
outfit
in
switzerland
called
cerberus
you
can
have
the
whole
thing
linked
to
a
central
console
that
displays
the
layout
of
the
perimeter
on
computer
screens
sounds
good
we
practically
going
to
have
computers
in
the
bathrooms
wo
come
cheap
bates
shrugged
into
the
wind
as
long
as
you
guys
ask
for
the
store
i
see
no
problem
i
budgeted
for
security
and
there
always
contingency
money
i
see
what
i
can
do
he
had
glanced
up
and
ascertained
that
the
sun
had
passed
the
yardarm
but
even
if
it
had
not
what
the
hell
he
saw
the
prospects
for
a
fat
commission
looming
how
about
a
heineken
he
was
reaching
into
the
cooler
in
the
well
you
read
my
mind
by
the
way
want
to
tell
me
the
location
of
the
site
you
managed
to
keep
that
out
of
the
papers
so
far
i
guess
it
probably
an
uninhabited
island
right
good
guess
it
north
of
crete
about
twenty
square
kilometers
privately
owned
but
i
just
signed
a
term
lease
vance
tried
to
envision
the
place
most
of
the
greek
islands
tended
to
be
granite
with
nothing
growing
on
them
but
scrub
cedar
what
the
terrain
like
that
actually
what
makes
it
so
attractive
cliffs
all
around
the
shoreline
you
could
put
in
with
so
much
as
a
dinghy
and
then
one
really
marvelous
deepwater
inlet
but
the
best
part
is
the
interior
is
mostly
level
and
perfect
for
what
we
need
and
there
a
granite
mountain
at
one
end
that
ideal
for
our
telemetry
a
protected
docking
location
and
a
natural
telemetry
base
right
all
the
electronics
will
be
set
up
high
above
the
launch
facility
and
we
can
use
the
inlet
for
bringing
in
materials
we
should
only
have
to
dredge
it
a
bit
and
sink
some
pilings
it
well
along
i
already
signed
off
on
a
lot
of
the
prime
contracts
he
stared
at
the
blue
horizon
and
adjusted
the
wheel
again
and
i
let
you
in
on
another
secret
michael
i
bet
the
ranch
on
this
one
the
stock
offering
was
nearly
enough
to
capitalize
the
enterprise
i
had
to
raise
money
from
everybody
in
town
junk
bonds
the
fucking
banks
you
name
it
just
the
hardware
ran
close
to
three
hundred
million
even
put
up
my
stock
in
all
my
other
companies
if
this
project
fly
he
laughed
literally
i
going
to
be
joining
america
homeless
i
even
put
up
my
house
in
arlington
worth
two
million
and
i
owned
the
goddamn
thing
free
and
clear
i
just
have
to
hand
over
the
keys
dorothy
kill
me
then
we
make
sure
nobody
snoops
he
popped
open
an
beer
for
bates
then
one
for
himself
from
land
or
sea
land
or
sea
bates
hoisted
his
icy
green
bottle
which
actually
raises
an
interesting
question
he
took
a
sip
cold
and
bracing
how
about
security
from
the
air
flyovers
that
kind
of
action
let
them
come
there
be
nothing
to
see
except
for
the
launch
pad
and
telemetry
everything
going
to
be
underground
there
a
lot
of
caves
on
the
island
like
that
famous
one
on
antiparos
we
going
to
use
those
for
the
computers
and
assembly
areas
and
what
we
ca
find
in
place
we
just
excavate
it
beginning
to
sound
a
little
too
pat
vance
found
himself
thinking
but
that
what
security
experts
were
for
they
were
the
guys
who
got
paid
to
find
holes
in
a
project
like
this
the
thing
that
kept
gnawing
at
his
mind
however
was
the
phrase
by
land
or
sea
all
along
he
worried
about
penetration
from
the
air
had
he
been
right
after
all
chapter
three
sitting
at
main
control
the
central
desk
facing
the
large
display
screen
cally
andros
had
just
reached
a
conclusion
she
was
getting
old
two
more
weeks
to
her
birthday
then
a
measly
five
years
till
the
big
after
that
she
could
only
look
forward
to
a
holding
action
fighting
sags
and
building
dikes
to
hold
back
the
deluge
of
time
it
was
depressing
she
sipped
at
a
cup
of
black
coffee
emblazoned
with
the
satcom
logo
the
laser
eye
of
the
cyclops
and
impatiently
drummed
her
fingers
on
the
workstation
keyboard
trying
not
to
be
distracted
by
meditations
on
mortality
tonight
for
the
first
time
they
would
nin
up
the
superconducting
coil
all
the
way
in
their
most
important
test
yet
the
tech
crews
at
the
other
end
of
the
island
predicted
it
would
reach
peak
power
in
she
glanced
at
the
huge
digital
clock
on
the
blue
wall
next
to
the
screen
minutes
what
was
wrong
with
her
she
had
thought
that
one
over
a
lot
and
decided
the
answer
was
nothing
she
had
dark
greek
eyes
olive
skin
and
a
figure
that
would
stop
a
clock
a
perfect
size
eight
but
it
got
better
she
had
the
best
legs
in
the
world
the
absolute
very
best
if
they
would
necessarily
stop
a
timepiece
they
sure
as
heck
slowed
a
lot
of
traffic
over
the
years
no
her
problem
was
opportunity
whereas
on
paper
this
island
was
every
single
girl
dream
males
trapped
here
by
the
carload
all
the
men
were
either
too
young
or
too
old
or
too
dumb
or
too
married
moreover
those
in
the
control
room
mostly
in
their
late
twenties
saw
her
only
as
andros
charge
there
seemed
to
be
an
unspoken
rule
around
control
that
you
did
make
a
move
on
the
boss
lady
anybody
who
could
run
this
project
had
to
be
treated
with
the
distance
befitting
authority
especially
since
they
believed
all
she
really
cared
about
was
work
thanks
a
lot
whoever
dreamed
that
one
up
the
sickest
part
of
all
though
was
they
were
half
right
she
did
not
wish
herself
anywhere
else
in
the
world
right
now
men
or
no
men
she
occupied
the
center
of
the
universe
was
poised
for
the
shot
she
could
only
have
dreamed
about
five
years
ago
back
when
she
was
still
fighting
the
mindless
bureaucrats
at
nasa
with
project
cyclops
she
was
running
a
gamble
for
the
last
big
prize
of
the
twentieth
century
if
she
lived
to
be
a
hundred
she
would
never
be
handed
anything
this
terrific
ever
again
born
calypso
andropolous
years
ago
daughter
of
minded
greek
farmers
she
had
learned
to
believe
in
herself
with
a
fierce
unshakable
conviction
until
now
though
she
had
never
really
had
the
opportunity
to
test
that
faith
until
now
it
had
not
been
an
easy
journey
after
getting
her
doctorate
in
aerospace
engineering
from
cal
tech
she
had
struggled
up
through
nasa
kennedy
center
bureaucracy
to
the
position
of
chief
analyst
but
she
had
never
achieved
more
than
a
desk
job
she
had
wanted
more
a
lot
more
now
thanks
to
satcom
in
three
days
she
would
have
it
using
a
microwave
laser
nicknamed
cyclops
she
was
about
to
put
satcom
in
the
forefront
of
the
private
race
for
space
ironically
the
company
had
built
its
spaceport
barely
three
hundred
kilometers
from
her
birthplace
on
the
island
of
naxos
she
often
thought
about
life
ironies
sometimes
you
had
to
return
home
to
change
the
future
she
barely
remembered
that
rugged
little
island
now
the
images
were
faint
and
overly
romantic
those
times
dated
back
to
when
the
junta
of
colonels
had
seized
power
in
greece
soon
thereafter
her
parents
had
emigrated
they
and
their
daughter
joining
a
large
exodus
of
greeks
to
new
york
they
had
been
there
only
three
months
when
her
father
died
the
hospital
said
it
was
pneumonia
she
knew
it
was
mourning
for
greece
and
all
he
had
lost
he
had
loved
it
more
than
life
she
was
afraid
down
inside
in
a
place
where
she
did
visit
much
anymore
that
he
loved
it
more
than
he
had
loved
her
so
along
the
way
she
tried
to
forget
all
of
it
to
bury
her
memories
of
greece
and
now
here
she
was
back
again
in
new
york
cally
andropolous
had
in
spite
of
herself
thought
incessantly
of
greece
back
here
now
all
she
could
think
about
was
new
york
the
strongest
recollection
was
the
third
floor
of
a
tenement
on
tenth
avenue
and
street
a
section
of
town
widely
known
as
hell
kitchen
and
for
good
reason
the
schools
were
designed
to
make
sociopaths
of
all
those
trapped
inside
only
new
york
famous
bronx
high
school
of
science
one
of
the
finest
and
most
competitive
public
institutions
in
the
nation
offered
an
escape
from
their
horror
accepted
when
she
was
thirteen
calypso
andropolous
graduated
third
in
her
class
for
her
senior
science
project
she
created
a
rocket
using
as
the
phrase
goes
ordinary
household
chemicals
and
she
did
it
all
by
herself
with
a
little
help
from
a
skinny
french
canadian
boy
named
georges
lefarge
who
lived
with
his
mother
in
soho
by
that
time
she
knew
exactly
what
she
wanted
her
ambition
was
to
be
the
first
woman
in
space
nobody
said
it
would
be
easy
but
after
the
rocket
she
and
georges
had
launched
it
from
the
morton
street
pier
in
greenwich
village
she
felt
she
was
on
her
way
she
had
blossomed
in
every
way
much
to
her
frustration
a
lot
quicker
than
georges
did
at
age
seventeen
his
idea
of
sex
was
still
to
swap
chemical
formulas
so
she
finally
gave
up
on
him
as
a
lover
and
decided
to
wait
till
college
she
chose
cal
tech
selected
after
turning
down
acceptances
from
half
a
dozen
prestigious
universities
in
the
east
by
then
calypso
andropolous
had
decided
she
wanted
to
get
as
far
away
from
west
ninth
street
as
possible
and
she
never
wanted
to
see
another
eggplant
moussaka
as
long
as
she
lived
she
also
wanted
a
shorter
name
and
thus
it
was
that
her
long
greek
surname
became
merely
andros
that
simple
change
had
a
liberating
effect
on
her
far
beyond
what
she
had
expected
at
last
she
felt
truly
american
and
able
to
admit
to
loving
nothing
better
than
living
off
whoppers
and
fries
junk
food
was
in
fact
the
thing
she
missed
most
here
no
what
she
missed
most
was
alan
still
georges
had
picked
mit
and
she
did
not
see
him
again
until
he
came
to
cal
tech
for
grad
school
by
that
time
she
was
deeply
in
love
with
alan
harris
who
was
twenty
years
her
senior
she
was
discovering
things
about
herself
she
did
want
to
know
harris
was
a
biochemistry
professor
tall
and
darkly
handsome
and
she
wanted
desperately
to
live
with
him
she
knew
he
was
a
notorious
womanizer
but
that
matter
she
was
looking
for
a
missing
father
and
she
did
care
it
was
what
she
wanted
when
he
broke
it
off
she
thought
she
wanted
to
die
the
only
one
she
had
left
to
turn
to
was
georges
and
they
restarted
a
friendship
as
platonic
as
it
had
been
back
at
bronx
science
though
it
was
deeper
this
time
georges
told
her
to
forget
about
harris
and
just
concentrate
on
a
dissertation
it
was
not
easy
but
she
did
her
project
involved
compressing
a
big
computer
program
that
calculated
spacecraft
trajectories
into
a
small
one
that
could
be
operated
on
a
hand
calculator
she
then
devised
a
way
to
create
voice
commands
that
could
free
up
an
astronaut
hands
while
he
soon
she
told
herself
it
would
be
she
handled
other
controls
after
reading
every
nasa
report
that
ntis
had
released
on
microfiche
she
knew
no
one
there
had
created
anything
like
it
she
also
figured
out
that
nasa
was
a
hotbed
of
careerists
all
protecting
their
own
turf
the
only
obstacle
to
their
accepting
her
new
computer
program
would
be
the
nih
syndrome
not
invented
here
it
turned
out
she
was
right
and
wrong
by
happy
chance
her
dissertation
came
to
the
attention
of
edward
olberg
a
deputy
director
of
trajectory
control
at
the
kennedy
space
center
who
hired
her
a
week
later
with
a
gs
rating
a
full
two
grades
higher
than
customary
he
knew
a
good
thing
when
he
saw
it
and
now
cally
andros
computer
work
was
the
creation
of
a
nasa
employee
end
of
problem
she
still
wanted
to
be
in
the
astronaut
program
but
she
figured
she
had
made
a
good
start
she
was
wrong
it
turned
out
that
she
was
far
too
valuable
in
the
guidance
section
to
let
go
she
published
a
lot
of
papers
grew
very
disillusioned
and
was
on
the
verge
of
telling
them
to
stuff
it
when
an
executive
unknown
to
her
named
william
bates
called
one
may
morning
three
years
ago
said
he
had
read
all
her
papers
and
then
offered
her
a
job
that
caused
her
to
postpone
her
dreams
of
space
flight
he
wanted
her
to
head
up
a
private
space
program
she
was
he
told
her
too
good
to
work
for
the
government
she
should
be
out
in
the
real
world
where
things
happened
when
she
recovered
from
the
shock
she
felt
an
emotion
she
had
not
known
since
her
first
day
at
bronx
science
she
was
scared
in
the
business
world
the
responsibilities
were
and
fatal
you
were
not
blowing
some
anonymous
taxpayer
money
it
was
real
cash
furthermore
your
responsibilities
doubled
not
only
did
you
have
to
make
it
work
you
had
to
make
a
profit
she
loved
the
challenge
but
she
quaked
at
the
enormous
risk
finally
she
made
a
deal
yes
she
would
give
up
a
sure
career
for
a
risky
long
shot
but
on
two
conditions
first
she
got
to
pick
her
staff
and
second
someday
she
would
get
to
go
into
space
herself
although
he
clearly
thought
the
second
demand
rather
farfetched
for
satcom
he
assented
to
both
how
it
looking
cally
bates
was
striding
into
command
having
just
emerged
from
his
office
at
the
far
end
of
the
cavernous
room
fifties
but
trim
he
wore
a
trademark
white
shirt
and
blue
trousers
a
touch
of
the
yachtsman
even
ashore
a
former
vietnam
fighter
pilot
he
had
flown
over
from
the
company
head
office
in
arlington
virginia
two
days
ago
setting
down
the
company
gulfstream
iv
at
athens
to
be
on
hand
when
the
first
vehicle
went
up
as
he
stalked
up
he
was
his
usual
crabby
self
seemingly
never
satisfied
with
anything
that
was
going
on
she
looked
him
over
and
stifled
the
horrible
impulse
she
had
sometimes
to
call
him
alan
he
was
the
way
alan
harris
was
and
he
had
the
same
curt
voice
otherwise
though
they
were
nothing
alike
the
mind
works
in
strange
ways
cyclops
countdown
is
right
on
the
money
bill
to
the
second
big
benny
is
humming
and
coil
temps
are
nominal
georges
says
it
a
go
for
sure
this
time
we
going
to
achieve
the
power
levels
needed
to
lase
they
had
tried
two
preliminary
previously
but
the
supercomputer
had
shut
them
down
in
the
last
hour
of
the
countdown
both
times
looks
like
tonight
is
the
night
we
get
lucky
georges
lefarge
had
served
as
her
personal
assistant
throughout
the
project
even
though
he
formally
headed
up
the
computer
section
these
days
he
was
still
slim
almost
emaciated
with
a
scraggly
beard
he
seemed
to
leave
deliberately
unkempt
just
as
he
had
at
cal
tech
bates
had
bestowed
on
him
the
title
of
director
of
computer
systems
which
did
not
sit
well
with
his
leftist
politics
his
conscience
wanted
him
to
be
a
slave
to
the
exploiting
capitalists
not
one
of
them
however
he
always
managed
to
cash
his
bonus
checks
he
had
carried
on
a
flirtation
with
cally
sending
messages
back
and
forth
on
the
workstations
for
the
last
two
years
she
had
finally
taken
him
up
on
it
and
it
was
a
bust
all
around
la
at
this
moment
he
was
blended
into
a
sea
of
technicians
glued
to
the
computer
screens
in
command
central
the
nerve
center
of
the
entire
operation
the
young
americans
all
worked
in
a
room
slightly
smaller
than
three
tennis
courts
with
rows
of
workstations
for
the
staff
and
three
giant
master
screens
that
faced
out
from
the
far
wall
the
soft
fluorescents
cheerful
walls
spotted
with
posters
and
the
large
satcom
logo
muted
strains
of
pink
floyd
emanating
from
speakers
somewhere
in
the
corner
and
circulated
air
carrying
a
hint
of
the
sea
all
made
the
perfect
environment
for
the
nineteen
young
workers
spaced
comfortably
apart
at
the
lines
of
desks
this
evening
shift
as
they
watched
the
superconducting
coil
ratcheted
increasingly
larger
bursts
of
energy
into
the
accelerator
pumping
it
up
at
twelve
gigawatts
the
cyclops
should
if
all
went
well
begin
to
lase
the
coil
a
revolutionary
new
concept
for
storing
electrical
energy
was
situated
deep
in
the
island
core
it
was
a
storage

electricity
to
circulate
indefinitely

ready

microsecond
pulses
of

the
heart
of
the
system
was
an
electromagnetic
induction
coil
feet
in
diameter
and
feet
high
embedded
in
a
natural
cave
in
the
island
bedrock
the
coil
itself
was
a
new
alloy
that
became
superconducting
storing
electricity
without
resistance
losses
at
the
temperature
of
liquid
nitrogen
a
vacuum
vessel
almost
like
a
giant
thermos
bottle
surrounded
the
coil
and
its
cryogenic
bath
the
coil
fed
power
into
a
particle
accelerator
that
drove
the
centerpiece
the
cyclops
a
laser
designed
to
convert
the
energy
stored
in
the
coil
into
powerful
pulses
of
coherent
microwaves
the
supercomputer
would
then
focus
these
with
the
antennas
into
the
propulsion
unit
of
the
space
vehicle
that
unit
contained
simple
dry
ice
the
only
thing
simple
about
the
entire

would
be
converted
to
plasma
by

by
the

bates
interjected
assuming
everything
goes
well
here
tonight
and
the
storm
lets
up
i
scheduled
myself
on
the
agusta
over
to
kythera
in
the
morning
a
friend
of
mine
was
sailing
near
there
and
i
a
little
worried
i
just
tried
to
reach
him
on
the
radio
and
got
no
answer
maybe
his
radio
got
swamped
but
i
want
to
find
out
he
was
turning
to
head
back
to
his
office
now
though
i
got
some
calls
in
to
tokyo
so
keep
me
informed
on
the

and
your

on

more

she
caught
herself
thinking
begging
which
must
mean
the
money
getting
tight
again
but
hang
in
there
just
a
couple
more
days
bill
and
we
gon
na
show
the
world
a
thing
or
two
they
be
begging
let
them
invest
i
just
came
in
to
give
you
some
moral
support
bates
continued
pausing
and
to
tell
you
i
think
you
doing
a
terrific
job
bullshitting
the
help
again
she
laughed
not
quite
sure
she
believed
his
tone
why
not
it
free
a
scowl
but
just
keep
up
the
good
work
he
had
extracted
a
leather
tobacco
pouch
from
his
blue
blazer
and
begun
to
fiddle
with
his
heavy
briar
pipe
she
started
to
ask
him
to
please
not
smoke
here
with
all
the
sensitive
fujitsu
workstations
but
then
decided
they
were
his
workstations
if
this
thing
flies
literally
i
going
to
give
you
a
vulgar
stock
option
another
one
for
putting
up
with
me
how
about
a
bottle
of
aspirin
she
made
a
mock
face
i
do
have
any
time
to
spend
the
money
i
going
to
take
care
of
that
too
after
this
is
over
i
going
to
have
you
kidnapped
by
a
greek
beachboy
and
taken
to
some
deserted
island
where
there
only
one
way
to
pass
the
time
he
frowned
back
a
wry
crinkle
passing
through
the
tan
at
the
corner
of
his
eyes
twenty
years
ago
i
might
have
tried
to
do
it
myself
still
hoping
to
get
me
laid
she
gave
him
her
best
look
of
shock
and
they
both
had
to
laugh
the
sexual
electricity
was
there
whether
either
of
them
wanted
to
admit
it
or
not
there
a
time
and
place
for
everything
he
went
on
showing
he
could
hint
and
not
hint
at
the
same
time
you
definitely
working
too
hard
i
ca
take
all
the
credit
she
knew
when
to
be
and
when
to
change
the
subject
fast
we
owe
all
this
to
the
bed
oldest
living
fan
by
which
she
meant
isaac
mannheim
the
retired
mit
professor
whose
revolutionary
propulsion
idea
had
made
the
whole
project
possible
in
he
had
demonstrated
his
laser
concept
to
nasa
but
they
had
backed
away
claiming
they
had
too
much
invested
in
conventional
chemical
rockets
but
he
knew
it
would
work
knew
it
would
change
the
way
space
was
used
so
he
had
taken
the
idea
to
entrepreneur
william
bates
and
offered
to
sign
over
the
patents
for
a
piece
of
the
profits
bates
was
impressed
he
took
him
up
on
the
offer
raised
the
money
and
then
hired
the
best
aerospace
engineer
he
could
find
to
head
up
the
project
together
they
were
a
perfect
team
mannheim
with
flowing
white
hair
and
tweedy
suits
was
now
in
his
seventies
and
lived
in
retirement
in
cambridge
massachusetts
he
was
due
in
tomorrow
just
in
time
to
watch
the
first
of
a
scale
vehicle
when
he
arrived
in
athens
cally
always
dispatched
the
company
agusta
to
pick
him
up
a
corporation
she
figured
ought
to
behave
like
one
if
the
cyclops
goes
off
without
a
hitch
tonight
then
we
should
have
plenty
of
good
news
for
him
this
trip
bates
said
let
you
be
the
one
to
brief
him
oh
he
know
it
all
before
he
gets
here
he
calls
me
every
day
at
hours
our
time
to
check
things
out
i
could
use
him
to
set
my
watch
isaac
like
the
voice
of
our
conscience
always
telling
us
to
work
harder
and
better
well
good
for
him
he
smiled
and
flicked
a
gold
lighter
the
young
technicians
around
the
room
gave
him
a
disapproving
glance
but
kept
their
silence
the
boss
was
the
boss
besides
everybody
in
command
poised
in
front
of
their
screens
had
other
things
to
worry
about
eric
hamblin
formerly
of
sweetwater
texas
had
worked
as
a
guard
for
satcom
for
the
past
two
and
a
half
years
and
he
loved
the
job
he
was
a
casualty
of
the
eighties
who
got
to
spend
his
afternoons
hanging
out
on
one
of
greece
most
beautiful
islands
he
was
tall
thin
and
bronzed
to
perfection
during
his
weekends
on
crete
he
could
almost
pass
for
french
as
he
cruised
the
german
frauleins
who
lined
the
sands
in
their
string
bikinis
tonight
he
had
come
on
duty
at
seven
actually
a
couple
of
minutes
later
than
that
since
he
been
on
the
phone
to
a
girl
from
dresden
to
whom
he
had
made
some
pretty
overreaching
promises
she
wanted
to
come
back
to
crete
this
weekend
and
do
it
all
over
again
he
grinned
with
satisfaction
kiddingly
asking
himself
if
he
had
the
stamina
he
sighed
then
strolled
on
down
the
east
perimeter
the
security
here
at
this
end
of
the
island
was
good
as
it
was
everywhere
the
tall
hurricane
fence
was
topped
with
razor
wire
and
rigged
with
electronic
alarms
of
course
you
could
see
all
the
security
which
meant
the
place
did
not
feel
confining
or
scary
which
suited
him
fine
he
was
wearing
a
but
it
was
mainly
for
show
he
was
sure
he
could
hit
anything
if
god
forbid
he
should
ever
have
to
draw
it
besides
the
island
was
surrounded
by
miles
and
miles
of
water
the
deep
blue
aegean
the
whole
scene
was
a
fucking
hoot
and
he
gloried
in
it
sea
sand
and
on
weekends
running
german
snatch
who
could
ask
for
more
andikythera
was
indeed
a
travel
poster
come
to
life
though
it
still
was
owned
by
the
greek
shipbuilder
telemachus
viannos
as
part
of
his
major
investment
in
the
company
bates
had
negotiated
a
lease
for
satcom
and
by
the
time
the
technical
staff
started
arriving
the
few
greek
shepherds
on
the
island
had
been
comfortably
relocated
to
paros
construction
began
almost
immediately
after
bates
took
over
and
soon
it
was
almost
like
one
giant
cal
tech
laboratory
everything
from
big
benny
satcom
fujitsu
supercomputer
to
the
microwave
installation
was
state
of
the
art
here
satcom
had
created
a
launch
facility
that
was
within
ten
degrees
latitude
of
cape
canaveral
totally
secure
from
industrial
espionage
and
perfectly
situated
to
send
up
a
major
network
of
communication
satellites
even
now
though
the
island
remained
unbelievably
picturesque
its
sharp
white
cliffs
abutting
the
deep
blue
sea
then
rising
up
in
craggy
granite
to
a
single
peak
at
one
end
where
the
transmission
antennas
were
now
its
flawless
air
sparkled
in
the
mornings
then
ripened
to
a
rosy
hue
at
sunset
for
security
and
safety
as
much
as
for
aesthetics
the
major
installations
had
been
secured
deep
in
the
island
core
command
was
at
one
end
situated
behind
sealed
security
doors
and
a
tunnel
from
there
led
down
to
the
power
plant
installed
a
hundred
and
fifty
meters
below
sea
level
guarding
this
small
piece
of
paradise
had
been
a
snap
hamblin
scratched
at
his
neck
and
moved
on
through
the
sand
he
despised
the
shoes
they
made
him
wear
and
wished
he
could
be
barefoot
untie
his
ponytail
and
let
his
sandy
hair
flow
free
around
what
was
that
the
east
perimeter
was
totally
dark
but
he
caught
a
sound
that
almost
could
be
what
a
chopper
approaching
but
there
were
no
lights
anywhere
on
the
eastern
horizon
and
the
pad
was
dark
nobody
flew
bates
fancy
new
agusta
mark
ii
at
night
especially
with
no
lights
no
mistaking
it
now
though
a
whirlybird
was
coming
in
he
could
clearly
make
out
the
heavy
drumbeat
of
the
main
rotor
salim
altered
the
throttles
when
they
were
about
ten
meters
above
the
pad
and
they
started
drifting
sideways
for
a
second
it
looked
as
though
they
might
ram
the
agusta
but
then
he
applied
the
clutch
stopcocked
the
engines
and
hit
the
rotor
brake
the
hind
safely
touched
down
tires
skidding
they
were
in
best
of
all
there
been
no
radar
warning
alert
from
the
instrument
panel
around
them
the
facility
was
dark
and
as
he
shut
down
the
engines
deathly
quiet
the
wheels
of
the
retractable
landing
gear
had
barely
settled
onto
the
asphalt
before
the
main
hatch
was
open
and
the
men
were
piling
out
black
uzis
ready
the
first
rounds
already
chambered
hamblin
thought
briefly
about
raising
guard
command
at
the
front
desk
on
his
and
inquiring
what
in
hell
was
going
on
but
then
he
knew
how
they
hated
false
alarms
particularly
when
the
top
brass
was
busy
like
tonight
he
turned
and
studied
the
blinding
white
glow
surrounding
the
two
launch
vehicles
and
down
by
the
superstructure
on
the
western
end
of
the
island
they
were
basking
in
glory
as
though
anticipating
tonight
of
the
cyclops
he
automatically
glanced
at
his
watch
the
big
test
was
scheduled
for
about
twenty
minutes
from
now
no
instead
of
running
the
risk
of
looking
like
a
jerk
by
reporting
the
expected
arrival
of
satcom
execs
he
should
have
known
about
he
check
this
out
himself
jesus
why
did
anybody
tell
him
anything
he
mused
that
security
precautions
here
had
been
intended
to
guard
against
infiltration
through
the
fences
not
to
prevent
a
chopper
from
coming
in
guess
they
figured
nobody
would
be
crazy
enough
to
try
and
sneak
in
using
a
helicopter
as
he
moved
toward
the
landing
pad
just
over
a
hundred
yards
farther
on
down
the
fence
line
he
searched
his
memory
for
something
he
might
have
forgotten
no
he
glanced
over
the
schedule
for
the
pad
this
afternoon
and
nothing
was
listed
andros
what
a
fox
she
was
made
those
plump
german
broads
look
like
leftover
hamburger
always
had
been
good
about
keeping
the
schedule
up
to
date
he
liked
that
and
counted
on
it
but
then
maybe
this
was
some
kind
of
unscheduled
situation
connected
with
the
test
who
the
hell
knew
he
was
about
to
find
out
fifty
yards
to
go
he
could
see
the
chopper
now
and
it
was
huge
much
bigger
than
anything
he
ever
known
the
company
to
use
maybe
it
was
a
delivery
an
emergency
they
had
touched
down
but
still
no
landing
lights
that
did
make
any
sense
suddenly
nothing
made
any
sense
another
ten
seconds
though
and
he
zap
them
with
his
big
flashlight
he
flipped
the
securing
strap
on
his
and
tested
the
feel
of
the
grip
just
to
be
ready
he
was
thirty
yards
away
and
he
could
hear
them
talking
now
though
he
still
did
not
recognize
all
the
languages
he
realized
right
away
however
that
these
clowns
were
connected
with
satcom
he
had
an
uneasy
feeling
all
along
and
now
he
was
sure
were
they
industrial
spies
trying
to
pull
a
fast
one
maybe
sneak
in
and
take
some
photos
he
had
no
time
now
to
radio
for
help
he
was
on
his
own
he
drew
out
the
and
cocked
it
suddenly
it
felt
very
heavy
then
in
his
left
hand
he
rotated
the
long
flashlight
till
his
thumb
felt
the
switch
now
he
flicked
on
the
light
beaming
it
through
the
wire
security
fence
and
catching
the
side
of
the
chopper
god
it
was
huge
just
in
time
to
see
several
men
stepping
down
they
were
wearing
black
commando
outfits
and
they
most
definitely
were
not
anybody
from
the
company
he
yelled
his
courage
growing
stop
right
where
you
are
and
identi
one
of
the
intruders
whirled
in
his
direction
and
before
he
could
finish
he
felt
a
deep
burning
sensation
in
his
chest
that
slammed
him
backward
next
a
piercing
pain
erupted
in
his
neck
and
his
head
dropped
sideways
the
asphalt
of
the
pavement
came
up
crashing
against
his
nose
he
heard
the
dull
thunk
of
silencers
just
as
the
world
went
forever

intense

said
in

his

he
just
wasted
some

no

then
he
slipped
the
uzi
strap
over
his
shoulder
and
turned
back
come
to
think
of
it
this
was
the
thirteenth
man
he
d
killed
with
an

maybe
the
number
would
be
lucky
ramirez
looked
out
over
the
facility
confident
posing
as
an
electronics
supplier
he
had
fully
reconnoitered
the
site
two
months
earlier
meticulously
memorizing
the
location
of
everything
they
needed
once
again
he
reflected
on
how
fortuitous
its

was

made
to
be

he
heard
no

from
any
of
the

which
meant
no
more
surprises
in
this
remote
corner
for
reasons
of
safety
satcom
deliberately
had
located
the

pad
as
far
as
possible
from
the

and
the

installation
all

at

at

moved

stood
at
the

studying
each

one
last
time
and
hoping
he
could
keep
them
together
as
a
team
so
far
almost
everything
had
gone
according
to
plan
he
had
picked
assembled
and
trained
them
four
months
in
libya
rehearsing
them
for
all
the
standard
antiterrorist
techniques
that
might
be
used
against

that
no
questions
would
be
asked
the
most
unreliable
team
member
was
salim
khan
tonight
pilot
ramirez
watched
him
pat
a
clip
into
his
uzi
and
draw
back
the
gnarled
walnut
cocking
knob
on
the
top
as
he
stepped
through
the
gate
he
looked
trustworthy
but
he
really
was
ramirez
suspected
salim
was
too
bitter
was
too
strongly
of
the
opinion
life
had
given
him
a
screwing
which
meant
he
was
now
devoted
to
settling
the
score
he
liked
to
live
on
the
edge
push
the
rules
on
the
other
hand
this
mission
was
all
about
that
and
thus
far
ramirez
had
exploited
the
iranian
to
the
hilt
it
also
meant
however
that
he
had
to
be
watched
he
was
a
cynical
realist
who
held
nothing
but
contempt
for
the
militant
cadres
of
young
firebrands
who
marched
through
the
streets
of
tehran
with
photos
of
some
ayatollah
attached
defiantly
to
their
chest
chanting
slogans
against
the
great
satan
while
wearing
jeans
whose
back
pockets
read
made
in
because
salim
did
believe
in
anything
anymore
he
was
difficult
to
control
always
dicey
following
close
behind
him
also
carrying
a
black
uzi
was
jamal
his
younger
brother
jamal
with
crazy
eyes
and
a
beard
was
the
exact
opposite
he
only
fought
for
a
cause
jamal
had
come
to
lebanon
years
ago
to
join
hizballah
a
radical
organization
headquartered
in
west
beirut
and
the
bekaa
valley
since
he
joined
as
many
as
five
hundred
hizballah
had
been
directly
involved
in
terrorist
acts
in
the
middle
east
and
europe
he
believed
god
wanted
him
to
carry
out
a
jihad
a
holy
crusade
against
the
americans
and
zionists
who
had
surrounded
and
were
choking
the
muslim
peoples
to
prove
his
faith
he
had
been
part
of
the
team
that
commandeered
a
libyan
arab
airlines
in
flight
between
zurich
and
tripoli
leading
to
the
longest
hijacking
in
history
the
plane
had
traveled
six
thousand
miles
bouncing
from
beirut
to
athens
then
rome
again
beirut
and
even
tehran
before
ending
on
its
third
stop
in
lebanon
three
days
later
miraculously
jamal
had
walked
free
he
was
a
hothead
but
he
also
was
a
survivor
jamal
prayed
five
times
a
day
neither
drank
nor
smoked
and
had
been
one
of
the
explosives
experts
on
the
embassy
job
in
beirut
that
killed
marines
he
was
truly
a
living
contradiction
that
was
fine
with
ramirez
he
could
care
less
about
radical
politics
on
the
other
hand
he
always
made
good
use
of
them
after
jamal
famous
hijacking
ramirez
had
gone
to
the
bekaa
valley
and
found
him
and
through
him
salim
who
by
stealing
the
hind
had
turned
out
to
be
much
more
valuable
than
his
rabid
younger
brother
all
the
same
he
had
problems
with
them
iranians
sometimes
had
difficulty
discerning
the
difference
between
fact
and
fantasy
as
with
most
muslims
they
thought
that
saying
something
was
so
made
it
happen
the
tall
man
striding
through
after
jamal
nursing
a
slight
limp
was
stelios
tritsis
their
only
greek
in
as
a
young
firebrand
he
had
been
a
founding
member
of
the
famous
terrorist
organization
epanastaiki
organosi
noemvri
in
his
heart
he
was
still
a
radical
dedicated
to
forcing
greece
out
of
nato
and
ending
the
military
domination
of
his
country
the
new
american
imperialism
in
the
persian
gulf
had
only
proved
he
was
right
all
along
because
of
an
incident
long
ago
in
his
youth
a
torture
episode
at
the
hands
of
the
infamous
colonels
stelios
eyes
never
seemed
entirely
focused
he
had
become
addicted
to
the
morphine
given
to
relieve
the
pain
and
never
kicked
it
even
so
he
was
their
most
lethal
marksman
and
he
considered
this
operation
his
final
revenge
against
america
and
her
lackeys
the
man
did
care
honestly
did
care
about
his
share
of
the
money
even
ramirez
had
to
admire
that
following
him
was
moreau
head
of
the
famous
action
directe
whose
international
wing
was
headquartered
in
paris
was
tall
had
long
flowing
blond
hair
and
determined
eyes
he
also
had
a
famous
bullet
scar
across
his
cheek
from
an
attempt
in
the
early
eighties
to
assassinate
former
justice
minister
alain
peyrefitte
with
a
bomb
attached
to
his
car
he
merely
killed
the
chauffeur
and
was
wounded
by
the
security
guards
but
in
november
he
got
his
revenge
masterminding
the
murder
of
georges
besse
the
chairman
of
renault
he
wanted
nothing
more
than
for
europe
to
rid
herself
of
americans
and
zionists
toward
which
end
action
directe
had
cooperated
with
the
lebanese
armed
revolutionary
faction
on
several
attacks
carried
out
in
france
which
was
how
ramirez
had
first
met
him
in
the
past
action
directe
had
financed
its
operations
primarily
through
bank
robberies
after
this
moreau
was
told
their
money
problems
would
be
over
the
next
man
was
wolf
helling
the
lanky
balding
leader
of
revolutionare
zellen
ramirez
suspected
his
real
goal
in
life
was
to
look
as
aryan
as
possible
politically
he
was
an
anarchist
who
had
in
bombed
a
nato
fuel
pipeline
near
lorch
in
official
aim
was
to
pressure
the
out
of
germany
through
terrorist
attacks
and
to
destroy
the
west
german
system
by
conducting
guerrilla
terrorism
against
zionists
and
militarists
rz
had
ties
to
palestinian
terrorist
organizations
which
was
again
how
ramirez
had
met
him
how
ironic
for
helling
just
when
he
had
lived
to
see
the
zionist
american
military
begin
to
depart
europe
it
had
become
the
de
facto
ruler
of
the
middle
east
he
wanted
to
teach
america
one
final
lesson
the
propertied
classes
of
the
world
could
never
be
secure
following
behind
him
were
three
beefy
former
members
of
east
stasi
now
being
sought
by
authorities
in
the
new
unified
germany
for
torture
and
other
crimes
of
the
past
with
few
friends
left
they
had
thrown
in
their
lot
with
rz
they
had
always
reminded
ramirez
of
the
three
monkeys
of
folklore
rudolph
schindler
with
his
dark
sunglasses
could
see
no
evil
peter
maier
remained
such
a
rabid
ideologue
he
still
could
hear
no
evil
of
communism
and
henes
sommer
spoke
nothing
but
evil
against
everyone
they
were
sullen
and
bitter
but
they
were
perfect
goons
for
auxiliary
firepower
or
should
be
they
were
men
without
a
country
guns
for
hire
who
already
had
lost
everything
dore
peretz
their
renegade
israeli
walked
through
last
closing
the
wire
gate
behind
him
he
had
fixed
his
steady
dark
eyes
on
only
one
outcome
he
had
come
for
the
money
the
money
only
no
politics
or
for
him
he
already
had
selected
a
seaside
villa
in
hadera
despite
his
annoying
tendency
to
shoot
off
his
mouth
to
make
jokes
at
the
wrong
time
his
contribution
would
be
crucial
ramirez
did
not
wholly
trust
him
but
he
needed
his
computer
and
weapons
expertise
he
asked
himself
what
peretz
would
do
if
the
chips
were
really
down
with
luck
however
that
question
would
never
have
to
be
answered
ramirez
almost
liked
him
he
was
not
sure
why
and
would
hate
to
have
to
kill
the
fucker
they
were
in
command
lay
at
one
end
of
satcom
setup
the
two
vehicles
at
the
other
and
in
between
was
the
living
quarters
known
as
the
bates
motel
as
well
as
rows
of
small
warehouses
that
contained
supplies
for
personnel
and
equipment
maintenance
used
for
storage
but
now
darkened
and
locked
as
they
moved
along
the
walkway
carefully
staying
out
of
the
circles
of
light
that
illuminated
the
doorways
of
the
warehouses
their
black
slipovers
blended
into
the
aegean
night
the
minimal
lighting
in
this
area
caused
him
no
hesitation
he
had
thoroughly
memorized
the
site
he
knew
they
would
find
the
control
center
with
the
computers
just
below
their
present
location
now
they
were
approaching
the
to
command
the
lobby
just
inside
the
space
a
uniformed
greek
guard
occupied
a
teakwood
desk
attentively
studying
the
sports
section
of
an
athens
newspaper
they
paused
in
the
last
shadows
before
the
open
space
fronting
the
entryway
giving
stelios
tritsis
time
to
shuck
his
black
pullover
underneath
he
was
wearing
the
brown
uniform
of
a
satcom
guard
complete
with
epaulets
and
the
regulation
he
also
had
what
upon
casual
inspection
looked
like
a
satcom
photo
id
while
the
others
waited
holding
their
breath
he
stepped
through
the
glass
entry
doors
feigning
a
jaunty
pace
and
flipping
the
pass
impatiently
against
the
leg
of
his
uniform
when
the
satcom
guard
looked
up
puzzled
and
started
to
challenge
him
tritsis
was
only
five
feet
away
he
sang
out
a
hello
in
greek
then
reached
to
scratch
an
itch
in
the
small
of
his
back
when
his
hand
came
away
it
was
holding
a
small
automatic
the
shot
was
directly
in
the
forehead
a
dull
thunk
and
the
guard
tumbled
backward
in
his
chair
his
eyes
disbelieving
his
still
holstered
it
took
only
seconds
without
a
word
the
rest
of
them
moved
in
what
next
ramirez
said
quietly
to
peretz
the
code
for
the
doors
has
to
be
punched
in
there
he
pointed
behind
the
desk
was
a
computer
terminal
that
reported
the
security
status
of
all
the
sectors
its
green
screen
remained
blank
flashing
no
alerts
disable
them
ramirez
ordered
the
first
test
of
the
technical
skills
in
the
hours
to
come
he
would
prove
indispensable
or
so
he
claimed
then
deactivate
the
access
code
and
we
ought
to
be
able
to
just
walk
in
while
jamal
was
rearranging
the
guard
body
leaving
him
slumped
over
the
desk
as
though
asleep
ramirez
locked
the
entry
doors
behind
them
then
stepped
behind
the
desk
and
dimmed
the
lobby
lights
finally
he
slipped
off
his
flight
suit
and
tossed
it
behind
the
desk
right
on
schedule
they
headed
toward
command
he
knew
that
if
you
control
the
brain
you
are
master
of
the
body
and
now
they
had
to
seize
that
brain
so
far
their
smooth
progress
surpassed
his
hopes
but
the
next
phase
was
crucial
allowed
for
no
he
still
feared
his
ad
hoc
troops
might
get
and
destroy
some
of
the
critical
equipment
he
had
even
considered
making
them
use
blanks
but
that
was
taking
too
big
a
risk
the
gates
of
paradise
are
about
to
be
opened
jamal
declared
through
his
black
beard
his
crazed
eyes
reflecting
back
the
lights
on
the
security
door
as
they
changed
from
red
to
green
and
a
muted
buzzer
sounded
allah
has
given
this
to
us
ramirez
said
nothing
merely
straightened
the
cuffs
of
his
charcoal
brioni
then
he
stepped
back
to
watch
as
the
door
to
command
central
slowly
began
sliding
to
the
left
cally
was
thinking
about
how
much
she
would
love
a
pizza
heavy
on
the
cheese
and
italian
sausage
no
just
heavy
on
the
cholesterol
why
was
it
that
the
only
things
that
tasted
good
were
all
supposed
to
be
bad
for
you
she
had
long
ago
determined
never
to
let
it
bother
her
like
scarlett
she
think
about
it
tomorrow
the
heck
with
it
everybody
needed
a
secret
sin
and
that
was
the
worst
part
of
being
here
on
andikythera
you
could
just
pick
up
a
phone
she
stared
across
the
cavernous
room
her
stomach
grumbling
and
looked
at
the
large
overhead
screen
intended
to
track
the
space
vehicle
after
then
she
glanced
around
at
the
rows
of
desks
with
computer
workstations
that
lined
the
floor
it
was
almost
as
though
she
had
a
small
army
under
her
command
all
this
power
and
she
still
order
up
a
pizza
what
was
wrong
with
this
picture
she
was
so
preoccupied
with
her
thoughts
that
she
completely
failed
to
notice
the
new
arrivals
as
ramirez
took
position
he
quickly
noticed
everything
at
the
far
end
beneath
the
huge
master
screens
a
wide
desk
commanded
the
room
and
behind
it
sat
a
woman
whose
history
he
had
committed
to
memory
she
was
the
one
that
counted
odd
that
a
woman
should
be
in
charge
but
then
a
woman
had
even
been
elected
president
of
a
major
muslim
country
once
all
things
were
possible
now
and
then
it
did
not
matter
to
him
not
the
way
he
knew
it
mattered
to
these
two
iranians
he
lived
in
the
real
world
they
lived
in
a
world
that
did
not
exist
they
he
knew
would
say
it
did
not
exist
well
that
was
their
problem
not
his
gradually
as
one
technician
after
another
became
aware
of
them
standing
in
the
doorway
all
activity
ceased
ten
men
dressed
in
black
all
armed
with
uzis
their
image
triggered
a
reflexive
response
of
fear
throughout
the
room
nurtured
by
decades
of
terrorism
in
the
news
ramirez
surveyed
the
room
none
of
the
american
technicians
had
any
weapons
as
anticipated
he
had
caught
the
prey
unprepared
indeed
he
had
hoped
to
avoid
gunfire
keep
the
staff
calm
they
would
be
needed
you
will
continue
please
as
you
were
his
voice
sounded
over
the
room
english
with
only
a
trace
of
accent
but
that
trace
of
accent
was
bloodless
the
authority
with
which
he
spoke
let
everybody
know
that
the
command
chain
had
just
changed
cally
turned
to
stare
at
the
intruders
puzzled
they
were
strangers
now
the
sight
of
their
automatic
weapons
registered
and
they
were
armed
they
sure
did
work
for
satcom
how
the
hell
did
they
get
through
facility
security
their
leader
she
noted
that
he
was
wearing
a
sharp
italian
suit
not
commando
mufti
and
he
was
doing
the
talking
was
scanning
the
room
as
though
he
already
owned
it
and
in
truth
he
did
like
the
american
embassy
in
tehran
satcom
had
been
caught
sleeping
but
there
was
no
gesturing
of
weapons
he
seemed
to
want
to
maintain
normality
they
terrorists
her
intuition
was
screaming
but
no
her
rational
mind
answered
back
it
could
be
true
terrorism
operated
a
universe
away
from
andikythera
it
was
supposed
to
touch
the
lives
of
anybody
outside
the
hot
spots
now
their
spokesman
was
strolling
down
the
aisle
between
the
computer
terminals
headed
her
way
she
figured
him
for
late
forties
educated
subject
to
reason
he
seemed
rational
or
at
least
businesslike
he
could
have
been
a
satcom
vp
from
arlington
dropping
by
for
a
surprise
inspection
the
rest
except
for
a
couple
of
arabs
with
beards
looked
like
eurotrash
hoods
miss
andros
i
presume
the
man
said
then
laughed
it
is
a
pleasure
to
meet
you
at
last
what
are
you
doing
here
her
disorientation
was
being
rapidly
replaced
by
anger
this
is
a
restricted
area
the
man
smiled
almost
politely
and
seemed
to
ignore
the
question
you
are
absolutely
correct
very
reasonable
and
proper
but
please
you
and
your
staff
must
just
continue
on
and
pay
no
attention
to
us
your
is
scheduled
for
hours
you
will
of
course
report
nothing
amiss
which
will
be
true
he
bowed
lightly
i
sure
they
will
want
to
know
how
the
cyclops
went
in
fact
we
are
all
anxious
for
the
answer
to
that
his
words
echoed
off
the
hard
surfaces
command
central
its
pale
blue
walls
notwithstanding
had
never
seemed
more
stark
i
appreciate
it
very
much
if
you
would
leave
she
said
holding
her
voice
quiet
this
is
private
property
you
are
trespassing
the
man
just
smiled
again
and
walked
over
to
examine
the
big
screens
these
things
have
always
intrigued
me
like
something
in
the
movies
buck
rogers
he
turned
back
please
do
let
my
layman
curiosity
interfere
with
your
work
bill
bill
she
thought
of
satcom
ceo
in
his
office
just
beyond
the
doors
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
you
got
a
radio
and
you
can
see
this
room
on
a
security
monitor
ca
you
the
door
at
the
far
end
opened
and
there
stood
william
bates
who
the
hell
are
you
his
voice
boomed
over
the
room
my
name
need
not
concern
you
the
terrorist
in
the
suit
answered
just
call
me
number
one
but
i
will
favor
you
by
returning
your
question
and
i
give
you
the
same
answer
number
one
or
whoever
the
hell
you
are
bates
replied
not
moving
whatever
you
thinking
nothing
here
to
steal
you
wasting
your
time
what
more
trespassing
on
american
property
so
take
those
goons
with
you
and
get
the
hell
out
the
same
way
you
came
in
american
property
americans
seem
to
think
the
whole
world
is
their
property
he
smiled
once
more
but
let
me
put
your
mind
at
ease
we
are
not
here
to
steal
and
if
you
cooperate
no
one
in
this
room
will
be
harmed
cally
looked
him
over
asking
herself
whether
she
believed
him
not
for
a
minute
she
suddenly
realized
this
man
would
kill
anyone
who
got
in
his
way
it
was
etched
into
his
eyes
now
miss
andros
you
should
order
your
people
to
proceed
with
the
countdown
my
understanding
is
that
the
first
vehicle
is
scheduled
to
be
launched
in
less
than
hours
we
certainly
want
nothing
to
disrupt
your
timetable
she
stared
at
him
more
closely
puzzled
if
he
and
these
creeps
here
for
blackmail
threatening
to
destroy
the
facility
against
a
payoff
then
what
could
they
possibly
want
you
do
give
the
orders
here
bates
moved
toward
the
man
i
do
he
dropped
his
voice
as
he
passed
cally
do
do
a
goddamn
thing
then
he
looked
up
you
will
leave
right
now
or
i
call
my
security
staff
that
would
be
most
unwise
at
least
two
of
them
would
be
unable
to
respond
he
nodded
toward
the
door
you
are
welcome
to
check
outside
but
come
we
all
wasting
precious
time
you
son
of
a
bitch
i
wo
well
well
the
man
interrupted
could
it
be
i
am
luckier
than
i
dreamed
possible
could
it
be
that
i
have
the
honor
to
be
speaking
to
none
other
than
william
bates
have
we
snared
the
ceo
no
that
would
be
too
much
good
luck
we
screwed
cally
thought
he
knows
now
they
hold
bill
for
ransom
he
pure
gold
rich
and
famous
you
will
kindly
take
a
seat
bates
the
man
went
on
the
hell
i
one
of
the
bearded
men
carrying
an
automatic
weapon
stepped
forward
and
slammed
the
metal
butt
into
bates
stomach
sending
him
staggering
backward
he
tried
to
catch
his
balance
but
failed
and
collapsed
ignominiously
onto
the
gray
linoleum
again
we
squandering
time
the
spokesman
the
one
in
charge
continued
calmly
where
were
we
oh
yes
the
he
turned
around
now
miss
andros
none
of
us
wants
that
report
to
be
late
do
we
it
would
look
bad
for
everybody
chapter
four
when
vance
caught
his
first
clear
sight
of
andikythera
sheltered
inlet
the
storm
had
passed
over
in
the
night
and
homer
fingered
dawn
was
displaying
all
her
splendored
glory
with
only
a
slight
effort
he
had
altered
his
course
and
reached
the
island
now
as
he
rowed
in
through
the
still
turquoise
waters
only
light
surface
ripples
lapped
against
his
switlik
as
quickly
as
it
had
come
the
turmoil
in
the
seas
had
vanished
he
hoped
it
was
a
good
omen
he
looked
down
and
realized
the
water
was
so
crystalline
he
could
see
the
bottom
now
at
least
ten
meters
below
although
he
had
visited
many
islands
he
had
never
seen
anything
more
perfect
than
andikythera
despite
being
and
soaked
to
the
skin
conditions
that
exacerbated
his
anger
the
sight
of
the
island
momentarily
buoyed
his
spirits
it
reminded
him
of
a
thousand
caribbean
mornings
the
feeling
of
rebirth
and
renewal
andikythera
had
always
been
private
and
never
more
so
than
now
it
was
an
industrial
site
these
days
pure
and
simple
no
ferries
deposited
tourists
here
no
fishing
boats
docked
in
the
mornings
nothing
but
granite
cliffs
surrounded
the
secrets
held
inside
the
heavy
construction
equipment
the
prefabricated
buildings
the
facility
components
all
had
come
through
this
harbor
now
however
the
dock
was
deserted
the
cranes
and
giant
mechanical
arms
highlighted
against
the
morning
sky
stood
idle
everything
had
been
delivered
was
in
place
and
was
humming
the
only
vessel
now
tied
up
was
a
sailing
yacht
bill
morgan
leased
specially
so
he
could
keep
his
hand
in
while
here
great
boat
abruptly
he
stopped
rowing
think
a
minute
he
told
himself
you
ca
risk
using
the
inlet
no
way
on
the
right
and
left
sides
of
the
harbor
steep
crags
of
white
granite
speckled
with
scrub
cypress
guarded
the
shore
while
the
towering
cliffs
of
the
north
mirrored
the
coastline
of
a
thousand
greek
islands
unlike
the
postcard
photos
for
sale
everywhere
on
the
tourist
islands
featuring
topless
swedish
blondes
and
trim
italian
playboys
gold
chains
glinting
this
was
the
real
greece
harsh
and
severe
only
a
few
seabirds
swirling
over
the
near
shore
adding
their
plaintive
calls
to
the
churn
of
surf
pounding
over
the
rocks
broke
the
silence
he
studied
the
island
trying
to
get
his
bearings
just
as
bill
had
said
it
appeared
to
be
about
three
miles
long
maybe
a
couple
of
miles
wide
as
though
balancing
the
mountain
at
one
end
at
the
opposite
terminus
stood
the
launch
vehicles
now
just
visible
as
the
tip
of
two
giant
spires
gleaming
in
the
early
sunshine
like
huge
silver
bullets
and
somewhere
beneath
this
granite
island
he
knew
was
the
heart
of
the
cyclops
satcom
gigawatt
laser
there
was
no
sign
of
anybody
monitoring
his
approach
the
early
light
showed
only
pristine
cliffs
cold
and
empty
careful
now
first
things
first
he
rowed
under
a
near
cliff
then
slipped
off
the
yellow
raft
and
into
the
waters
of
the
near
shore
still
dazzlingly
clear
it
reminded
him
again
of
the
caribbean
maybe
bill
unconsciously
had
an
island
there
in
mind
when
he
decided
to
move
everything
here
the
water
was
cold
refreshing
as
he
moved
in
he
collected
what
he
needed
from
the
raft
and
stood
a
minute
wondering
what
to
do
with
it
then
inspiration
struck
it
only
weighed
pounds
so
why
not
use
it
it
was
a
standard
switlik
which
meant
inflation
had
been
automatic
the
deflation
would
take
a
while
so
he
started
it
going
as
he
hefted
the
heavy
yellow
hulk
and
headed
up
the
hill
he
wanted
it
empty
but
not
entirely
the
security
dimitri
spiros
had
installed
was
and
good
he
had
not
gone
to
the
trouble
of
burying
cables
all
around
the
place
with
magnetic
anomaly
detectors
that
would
have
required
blasting
through
a
lot
of
granite
and
did
not
really
seem
worth
the
tab
instead
he
had
surrounded
the
place
with
a
fence
and
topped
that
with
spinning
wheels
of
razor
wire
known
as
which
prevented
an
intruder
from
smothering
the
cutting
edges
with
cloth
then
just
to
make
sure
across
the
top
and
at
several
levels
below
he
had
added
lines
of
sabretape
with
an
enclosed
strand
a
pulse
of
light
was
transmitted
through
the
length
of
the
tape
and
if
it
was
disturbed
detectors
at
a
central
guard
location
would
know
immediately
when
and
where
now
vance
had
to
try
to
penetrate
a
system
he
had
actually
been
involved
indirectly
in
setting
up
the
ultimate
irony
the
jagged
granite
tore
at
his
hands
as
he
struggled
up
picking
his
way
through
the
clusters
of
scrub
cedar
that
clung
to
the
steep
ascent
and
dragging
the
switlik
by
its
nylon
straps
the
cliff
rose
a
good
two
hundred
feet
and
was
almost
sheer
but
he
located
enough
niches
to
haul
himself
forward
finally
exhausted
and
hands
bleeding
he
pulled
himself
over
the
top
then
he
dragged
up
the
remains
of
the
raft
ahead
just
in
front
of
the
towering
communications
mountain
he
discerned
arm
industrial
security
installation
a
fence
interwoven
with
fiber
optics
beyond
it
on
a
helicopter
pad
sat
bill
new
agusta
a
hot
mark
ii
with
all
the
latest
modifications
including
two
allison
engines
it
sat
there
its
blue
trim
like
ice
a
ghostly
apparition
against
the
lightening
sky
poised
alongside
was
a
brooding
hulk
that
dwarfed
the
agusta
a
soviet
one
of
its
stubby
wings
a
tangled
mass
of
metal
so
the
bastards
were
here
he
guessed
right
he
saw
no
guards
around
it
but
who
knew
he
would
find
out
soon
enough
but
one
thing
was
sure
it
must
have
a
radio
on
board
the
navy
would
be
very
interested
in
identifying
the
location
of
its
hostile
maybe
he
should
just
switch
on
the
cockpit
iff
let
it
start
broadcasting
if
the
ship
that
was
attacked
had
been
interrogating
the
hind
there
probably
be
knowledge
somewhere
of
the
codes
it
was
transmitting
easy
just
take
it
easy
go
in
behind
the
chopper
handle
the
fence
and
then
rush
the
thing
from
the
back
if
anybody
guarding
it
be
taking
them
from
their
blind
side
grasping
the
switlik
with
the
walther
tucked
firmly
into
the
waist
of
his
soaked
trousers
he
dashed
for
the
corner
of
the
fence
behind
the
hind
he
was
barefoot
the
way
he
always
sailed
and
the
granite
felt
sharp
and
cutting
under
his
feet
but
being
barefoot
was
going
to
help
him
take
the
fence
okay
he
thought
the
alarm
system
is
going
to
blow
no
matter
what
just
get
in
and
get
on
the
radio
quick
then
worry
about
what
comes
next
he
knew
the
only
way
to
defeat
a
system
was
at
the
corners
where
the
spinning
rolls
of
wire
intersected
at
a
right
angle
as
he
approached
the
corner
he
looked
up
and
checked
out
his
chances
yep
with
the
switlik
to
smother
the
barbs
it
might
just
be
possible
he
looped
one
of
the
nylon
straps
then
leaned
back
and
heaved
the
raft
up
onto
the
top
of
the
fence
it
caught
and
was
hanging
there
but
just
as
he
had
hoped
the
strap
passed
over
and
down
the
other
side
next
he
reached
through
seized
it
and
tied
it
securely
to
the
heavy
chain
links
of
the
fence
now
it
would
hold
the
raft
in
place
as
he
climbed
from
the
outside
holding
the
hand
straps
of
the
raft
he
clambered
up
and
made
it
to
the
top
then
he
rolled
himself
into
the
rubber
and
pushed
over
a
second
later
he
dropped
onto
the
asphalt
of
the
landing
pad
home
the
razor
wire
had
shredded
the
raft
and
the
security
system
would
have
detected
the
entry
but
he
was
in
if
any
guards
were
left
alive
they
probably
had
other
things
to
worry
about
or
so
he
hoped
at
that
instant
he
thought
he
heard
a
sound
and
whirled
back
no
he
had
only
caught
the
chirp
of
a
morning
bird
somewhere
in
the
cluster
of
trees
down
toward
the
shore
the
island
again
seemed
as
serene
as
a
paradise
he
crouched
a
moment
grasping
the
walther
then
shoved
a
round
into
the
chamber
the
early
morning
light
showed
the
hind
in
all
its
glory
it
was
dark
green
with
a
heavy
retractable
landing
gear
a
magnificent
machine
and
a
lethal
one
originally
intended
as
an
antitank
weapon
the
had
quickly
become
a
tool
for
ground
combat
to
reduce
vulnerability
to
ground
fire
its
makers
substituted
steel
and
titanium
for
aluminum
in
critical
components
and
replaced
the
original
design
with
rotors
the
only
defect
of
this
particular
example
was
the
absence
of
the
starboard
auxiliary
wing
including
the
rocket
pod
its
arrival
and
accurate
landing
here
spoke
volumes
for
the
flying
skills
of
whoever
had
been
at
the
controls
if
the
weapons
operator
had
possessed
comparable
talent
vance
reflected
he
might
not
be
standing
here
now
but
he
noted
again
it
had
israeli
markings
had
the
israelis
really
attacked
a
frigate
that
made
no
sense
for
one
thing
they
could
have
flown
a
hind
this
far
without
refueling
its
combat
radius
was
only
about
a
hundred
miles
then
he
looked
more
closely
and
realized
that
the
israeli
star
of
david
in
a
circle
of
white
had
merely
been
papered
on
so
it
was
a
job
which
more
than
ever
left
open
the
question
who
the
hell
were
they
gripping
the
walther
he
slid
open
the
door
to
the
cargo
bay
and
examined
the
darkened
interior
it
was
empty
save
for
a
few
remnants
of
packing
crates
he
climbed
in
and
checked
them
over
they
had
been
for
weapons
he
saw
some
markings
on
one
a
crate
of
grenade
launchers
another
had
contained
czech
light
machine
guns
with
spare
boxes
for
modifications
giving
them
capability
jesus
if
these
were
just
the
discarded
crates
what
else
did
these
guys
have
he
turned
and
moved
up
the
gray
metal
steps
to
the
cockpit
a
raised
bubble
above
the
weapons
station
nice
he
settled
himself
looking
out
the
bulletproof
windscreen
at
the
first
tinge
of
dawn
breaking
over
the
island
his
first
impulse
was
to
crank
her
up
and
fly
her
out
he
resisted
it
switching
on
the
iff
would
be
a
chore
he
was
not
even
sure
he
knew
how
he
could
however
get
on
the
airwaves
the
pilot
flight
helmet
was
stashed
on
the
panel
where
it
had
been
tossed
he
picked
it
up
and
slipped
it
on
then
clicked
on
the
electronics
the
helicopter
main
panel
and
screens
glowed
to
life
a
patchwork
of
green
and
red
lights
and
leds
he
flicked
more
switches
overhead
and
the
infrared
and
radar
systems
came
their
displays
like
lights
briskly
illuminating
one
by
one
in
rows
now
for
the
radio
it
was
of
course
with
heavy
metal
knobs
and
a
case
that
looked
as
though
it
could
withstand
world
war
iii
he
clicked
it
on
and
began
scanning
through
the
aviation
channels
checking
to
see
if
anybody
was
out
there
maybe
nothing
except
a
few
routine
exchanges
of
civilian
pilots
well
he
thought
could
be
it
takes
a
while
for
the
news
of
major
world
events
to
get
down
to
the
trenches
word
would
circulate
soon
enough
the
military
channels
however
would
be
another
matter
the
hind
had
them
all
he
clicked
over
to
the
frequencies
and
began
scanning
there
were
a
lot
of
scrambled
communications
the
radio
traffic
was
sizzling
he
figured
the
sixth
fleet
was
on
full
alert
except
they
did
know
where
to
look
for
their
hostile
he
remembered
that
the
military
emergency
channel
was
megahertz
he
punched
it
in
then
unhooked
the
black
mike
and
switched
to
transmit
the
green
diodes
blinked
to
red
moreau
who
had
perfect
command
of
english
was
catching
the
bbc
on
a
small
sony
in
command
central
keeping
abreast
of
the
news
the
world
service
was
just
winding
up
its
morning
broadcast
circumspect
as
always
a
reminder
of
the
main
story
there
are
unconfirmed
rumors
emanating
from
the
southern
aegean
that
an
american
naval
vessel
the
uss
glover
was
attacked
by
a
helicopter
gunship
late
last
evening
with
considerable
damage
and
loss
of
life
it
is
said
the
gunship
was
israeli
no
confirmation
or
denial
of
this
report
has
yet
been
issued
by
the
government
in
tel
aviv
and
that
the
end
of
the
news
from
london
guess
we
had
a
hit
he
laughed
then
switched
frequencies
and
started
monitoring
the
military
channels
ramirez
had
also
heard
the
broadcast
with
satisfaction
the
attack
would
soon
blossom
into
a
world
event
with
accusations
flying
after
that
had
played
its
course
he
would
drop
his
bombshell
now
it
was
daylight
time
to
begin
phase
three
of
the
operation
it
had
been
a
productive
night
the
first
order
of
business
had
been
to
their
hardware
in
addition
to
the
uzis
they
had
carried
in
they
had
broken
out
a
compliment
of
the
germans
had
also
brought
out
and
limbered
up
a
crate
of
submachine
guns
fully
automatic
with
folding
stocks
as
well
as
some
czech
mortars
and
grenade
launchers
that
was
finished
by
hours
after
which
the
men
caught
catnaps
rotating
to
keep
at
least
three
on
guard
at
all
times
now
that
the
test
had
gone
off
successfully
most
of
the
facility
staff
was
lounging
at
the
blank
terminals
dazed
ramirez
however
had
no
intention
of
letting
the
satcom
staff
become
rested
he
looked
over
the
room
at
the
young
engineers
all
of
whom
were
showing
the
first
signs
of
hostage
behavior
they
were
frightened
stressed
tired
already
in
the
early
stages
of
hostile
dependency
soon
they
would
melt
become
totally
pliable
but
to
achieve
that
they
could
not
be
allowed
to
get
enough
sleep
food
also
had
to
be
kept
to
a
minimum
most
importantly
all
telephone
and
computer
linkages
with
the
outside
world
had
been
cut
with
the
exception
of
one
the
single
telephone
remaining
was
on
the
main
desk
down
at
the
other
end
of
command
otherwise
peretz
had
methodically
shut
down
everything
including
the
telemetry
equipment
located
up
on
the
mountain
while
they
would
need
to
reactivate
it
later
on
for
the
moment
they
could
keep
it
on
standby
peretz
had
proved
reliable
so
far
ramirez
told
himself
the
man
was
seasoned
and
competent
unlike
the
young
muslims
who
acted
first
and
thought
later
an
operation
like
this
required
precision
not
unbridled
impetuosity
which
was
why
he
valued
the
israeli
so
highly
as
he
surveyed
command
he
decided
it
was
time
for
champagne
he
had
brought
a
small
bottle
a
split
of
dom
but
what
was
champagne
without
the
company
of
a
beautiful
woman
he
turned
toward
miss
andros
his
meditations
were
interrupted
by
the
startled
voice
of
moreau
there
a
mayday
on
point
five
megahertz
it
so
close
i
think
someone
is
transmitting
from
here
on
the
island
ramirez
cursed
while
the
buzz
in
command
subsided
then
moreau
continued
in
english
he
talking
about
the
and
he
giving
our
location
probably
one
of
the
guards
ramirez
paused
thinking
but
how
could
he
know
about
the
maybe
he
in
the
hind
monitoring
the
radio
helling
said
rubbing
at
his
balding
skull
we
you
brought
backup
time
to
use
it
ramirez
turned
and
beckoned
for
the
three
schindler
maier
and
sommer
it
was
time
for
the
three
monkeys
to
start
earning
their
keep
go
out
to
the
chopper
he
barked
to
them
in
german
and
handle
it
you
know
what
to
do
they
nodded
seriously
and
checked
their
uzis
they
knew
exactly
the
transmit
seemed
to
be
working
and
he
was
getting
out
everything
he
knew
the
location
of
the
hind
the
fake
nationality
the
attack
on
the
frigate
but
was
anybody
picking
it
up
the
heavy
soviet
radio
was
rapidly
drawing
down
its
batteries
but
he
figured
it
was
now
or
never
get
it
out
quick
and
hope
he
thought
pray
some
navy
ship
in
this
part
of
the
aegean
will
scan
it
and
raise
the
alarm
he
was
still
trying
to
piece
it
all
together
when
he
spied
the
figures
approaching
from
far
down
the
central
walkway
three
men
dressed
in
black
looking
just
like
a
hit
squad
he
had
not
expected
so
fast
a
response
and
for
a
second
he
was
caught
off
guard
they
must
have
been
monitoring
the
radio
if
you
had
any
sense
he
told
himself
you
have
expected
that
about
to
have
some
really
lousy
odds
the
hind
was
armored
like
a
tank
he
knew
and
even
the
bubbles
over
the
cockpit
and
the
weapons
station
were
supposedly
bulletproof
how
bulletproof
he
guessed
he
was
about
to
learn
with
the
three
men
still
a
distance
away
he
realized
he
had
only
one
choice
although
he
had
never
actually
flown
a
hind
this
seemed
an
ideal
time
to
try
and
find
out
how
difficult
it
was
probably
harder
than
he
knew
he
reached
up
and
flicked
on
the
fuel
feeds
then
pushed
the
starter
to
his
surprise
there
came
the
sound
of
a
long
dull
whine
that
began
increasing
rapidly
in
intensity
and
frequency
the
main
rotor
had
kicked
on
he
could
tell
from
the
vibration
and
the
tail
stabilizer
too
if
the
rpm
dials
were
reporting
accurately
all
right
he
told
himself
the
dial
on
the
right
side
of
the
panel
is
rotor
speed
keep
it
in
the
green
and
over
to
the
left
is
engine
speed
come
on
baby
go
for
the
green
red
line
means
you
crash
and
burn
pedals
okay
but
this
is
like
a
regular
airplane
the
stick
is
cyclic
controls
the
angle
of
your
blades
the
instruments
were
now
temperature
fuel
gauges
pressure
power
output
the
two
isotov
turboshafts
were
rapidly
bringing
up
rpm
now
already
past
three
thousand
he
grabbed
hold
of
the
collective
eased
back
on
the
clutch
and
felt
the
massive
machine
shudder
then
begin
to
lift
off
as
the
three
men
breached
the
gate
leading
into
the
landing
area
a
fusillade
of
fire
began
spattering
off
the
bubble
windscreen
leaving
deep
dents
in
the
clear
globelike
plastic
so
far
so
good
he
thought
it
holding
up
to
manufacturer
specs
now
for
the
power
it
controlled
by
the
collective
but
when
you
increase
power
you
increase
torque
so
give
her
some
left
pedal
to
compensate
the
hind
had
started
to
hover
and
now
he
moved
the
columns
to
starboard
bringing
it
around
he
could
not
reach
the
weapons
station
but
the
machine
gun
in
the
nose
had
an
auxiliary
fire
control
under
the
command
of
the
pilot
with
his
hand
on
the
stick
he
activated
the
fire
button
he
might
not
be
able
to
hit
anything
but
he
definitely
get
somebody
attention
the
machine
gun
just
below
him
erupted
a
deadly
spray
that
knocked
sparks
off
the
hurricane
fence
surrounding
the
pad
as
the
chopper
slowly
revolved
around
somewhere
now
off
to
his
left
came
a
new
burst
of
automatic
fire
he
found
himself
in
a
firefight
trapped
like
a
tormented
bull
in
a
pen
but
the
hind
was
up
and
hovering
and
also
beginning
to
slip
sideways
because
of
the
damaged
wing
he
grappled
with
the
collective
pitch
lever
in
his
left
hand
trying
to
regain
control
but
he
have
the
experience
the
chopper
was
now
poised
about
ten
feet
above
the
ground
its
engines
bellowing
nosing
around
and
drifting
dangerously
he
lost
control
as
it
tilted
sideways
the
fence
began
coming
up
at
him
aiming
directly
for
the
nose
bubble
even
more
unnerving
though
was
the
heavyset
terrorist
in
a
black
pullover
who
was
standing
directly
in
front
of
the
bubble
and
firing
his
uzi
worse
still
he
was
handling
it
like
second
nature
the
plastic
splintered
with
a
shriek
as
the
rounds
caught
it
the
curvature
had
helped
before
but
now
the
gunman
was
able
to
fire
straight
into
it
the
game
was
about
to
be
up
he
ducked
for
the
floor
of
the
cockpit
just
as
the
bubble
windscreen
detonated
spewing
shards
of
plastic
both
outward
and
inward
now
the
helicopter
was
coming
about
and
lifting
off
again
pulling
up
strands
of
the
wire
fence
that
had
gotten
tangled
in
the
landing
gear
no
time
to
worry
about
it
he
rose
up
grasped
the
collective
and
urged
more
power
trying
to
compensate
for
the
torque
but
the
mottled
gray
behemoth
was
increasingly
unstable
shunting
sideways
drifting
over
the
security
fence
and
spiraling
upward
toward
the
mountain
that
bristled
with
satcom
communications
gear
the
gunner
holding
the
uzi
slipped
in
another
clip
and
raised
up
to
finish
him
off
but
at
that
instant
vance
squeezed
the
fire
button
one
last
time
and
the
man
danced
a
pirouette
disappearing
from
view
as
he
started
to
spiral
in
earnest
more
automatic
fire
ricocheted
off
the
fuselage
then
came
a
sickening
whine
the
stabilizer
he
thought
they
must
have
hit
the
damned
stabilizer
this
is
going
to
be
a
very
short
trip
panic
caught
him
as
the
hind
started
into
autorotation
round
and
round
like
a
ride
at
an
amusement
park
he
cut
the
power
hoping
he
could
bring
her
down
using
the
energy
stored
in
the
blades
then
quickly
put
the
right
pedal
to
the
floor
held
the
collective
down
and
tried
to
keep
rotor
speed
in
the
green
he
was
drifting
to
the
east
now
headed
for
a
copse
of
trees
halfway
up
the
mountain
not
a
bad
place
to
set
down
he
thought
and
started
to
flare
the
blades
with
the
stick
hoping
he
could
bring
her
in
with
the
collective
the
hind
was
still
spinning
in
autorotation
but
not
yet
dangerously
slowly
slowly
he
was
about
thirty
feet
above
the
trees
when
a
splatter
of
automatic
fire
erupted
from
the
open
doorway
he
whirled
around
to
see
the
terrorist
he
bulldozed
into
the
fence
now
hanging
onto
the
metal
step
and
trying
to
pull
himself
in
what
now
the
man
vance
guessed
he
was
pushing
forty
with
a
face
of
timeless
brutality
was
covered
with
blood
and
his
aim
was
hampered
by
trying
to
hold
the
uzi
as
he
fired
the
other
hand
grasping
the
step
he
was
cursing
in
german
at
that
instant
the
hind
took
a
sickening
dip
and
the
uzi
clattered
onto
the
doorway
pallet
as
the
terrorist
relinquished
it
to
try
to
hold
on
with
both
hands
but
he
was
losing
it
his
hands
slippery
with
his
own
blood
and
all
that
held
him
now
was
the
torn
section
of
his
own
shirt
that
had
somehow
sleeved
over
the
step
then
his
grasp
gave
way
entirely
and
he
dangled
for
a
moment
by
the
shirt
before
it
ripped
through
and
he
fell
a
trailing
scream
he
landed
somewhere
in
the
trees
twenty
feet
below
leaving
only
the
shirt
in
the
meantime
the
hind
continued
spiraling
and
drifting
down
and
vance
looked
out
to
see
the
gray
granite
of
the
side
of
the
mountain
moving
toward
him
with
only
a
bramble
of
trees
in
between
but
at
least
the
chopper
autorotation
was
bringing
him
in
for
a
soft
crash
he
braced
himself
as
a
clump
of
trees
slapped
against
the
side
of
the
fuselage
then
the
helicopter
plunged
into
them
its
landing
gear
collapsing
as
it
crunched
to
a
stop
he
felt
himself
flung
forward
accompanied
by
the
metallic
splatter
of
the
rotor
collapsing
against
the
granite
shearing
and
knocking
the
fuselage
sideways
in
a
series
of
jolts
as
the
two
turboshaft
engines
automatically
shut
down
he
held
onto
the
seat
straps
and
reflected
that
this
was
his
first
and
probably
last
turn
at
the
stick
of
a
hind
and
all
he
managed
to
do
was
total
it
heck
of
a
way
to
start
a
morning
the
uzi
was
still
lying
on
the
floor
of
the
cabin
while
the
shirt
of
the
man
he
had
shot
was
wrapped
around
the
metal
step
and
lodged
beneath
the
crushed
landing
gear
when
he
reached
back
and
checked
to
see
that
the
walther
was
still
secured
in
his
belt
he
noticed
that
his
arm
had
been
lacerated
by
the
jagged
plastic
of
the
shattered
canopy
he
noticed
it
but
he
feel
it
he
was
feeling
nothing
only
a
surge
of
adrenaline
and
the
certain
knowledge
he
had
to
get
out
fast
with
the
uzi
he
scooped
it
up
and
stumbled
through
the
doorway
to
the
sound
of
muted
gunfire
down
the
hill
as
the
other
two
hoods
continued
to
advance
he
had
the
german
automatic
now
but
the
last
thing
he
wanted
was
a
shootout
nonetheless
rounds
of
fire
sang
around
him
as
he
ripped
the
black
shirt
loose
from
the
chopper
step
and
felt
the
pockets
one
contained
what
seemed
like
a
small
leather
packet
he
yanked
it
out
then
plunged
in
a
direction
that
would
bring
the
hind
between
him
and
the
other
two
assailants
but
when
he
tried
to
catch
his
footing
in
the
green
bramble
of
brush
he
fell
on
his
shoulder
and
rolled
feeling
a
spasm
of
pain
christ
this
was
no
longer
any
fun
about
twenty
feet
away
was
an
even
denser
copse
of
cypress
scrub
than
the
one
he
had
crashed
in
if
he
could
make
that
he
told
himself
have
some
cover
he
just
had
to
get
there
in
one
piece
half
scrambling
half
rolling
he
headed
for
the
thicket
of
trees
occasionally
loosing
a
round
of
covering
fire
down
the
hill
then
he
felt
the
scratchy
hardness
of
the
low
brush
and
threw
himself
into
the
bramble
dirt
spattered
as
rounds
of
fire
or
was
it
flecks
of
granite
ricocheted
around
him
and
then
he
felt
a
nick
across
one
shoulder
he
was
not
sure
from
what
a
couple
more
rounds
cut
past
but
now
they
were
going
wide
he
collapsed
into
the
dense
bramble
and
tried
to
catch
his
breath
what
next
the
uzi
still
had
a
clip
maybe
he
could
hold
them
off
he
stilled
his
breathing
and
listened
but
heard
nothing
the
mountainside
was
deathly
quiet
so
much
so
he
could
almost
hear
the
crash
of
waves
on
the
shore
below
it
was
probably
only
wishful
imagination
but
the
quiet
gave
hope
he
might
temporarily
be
out
of
danger
he
turned
and
looked
up
the
mountain
finally
able
to
see
it
clearly
the
near
hillside
was
covered
with
brush
the
only
objects
visible
above
the
green
being
the
tip
of
a
jungle
satcom
had
a
hell
of
a
communications
installation
outlined
against
the
blue
sky
were
huge
parabolic
antennas
used
for
microwave
uplinks
a
transmission
system
for
powering
the
space
vehicles
a
myriad
of
dishes
for
satellite
uplinks
and
downlinks
and
various
other
antennas
used
for
conventional
radio
it
was
all
set
inside
a
hurricane
fence
with
a
gray
cinderblock
control
hut
at
the
near
corner
well
he
thought
with
that
battery
of
antennas
there
surely
a
way
to
do
what
has
to
be
done
next
this
time
he
would
waste
radio
access
with
maydays
as
the
landing
announcement
sounded
through
british
air
flight
from
london
to
athens
isaac
mannheim
took
off
his
thick
spectacles
wiped
them
futilely
with
a
greasy
handkerchief
settled
them
back
and
stared
down
the
plane
was
now
on
final
approach
and
he
had
already
taken
down
his
flight
bag
and
stuffed
it
under
the
seat
in
preparation
ready
to
march
off
mannheim
was
professor
emeritus
at
mit
department
of
engineering
and
he
retained
the
intellectual
curiosity
of
a
mischievous
schoolboy
he
had
the
flowing
white
hair
of
a
european
philosopher
the
burning
eyes
of
a
jules
verne
visionary
the
minded
enthusiasm
of
a
born
inventor
the
discursive
knowledge
of
a
renaissance
man
and
the
of
a
true
genius
which
he
was
wearing
a
tweedy
checked
suit
a
frayed
brown
overcoat
smudgy
rims
and
a
boston
red
sox
baseball
cap
he
also
looked
every
bit
as
eccentric
as
his
reputation
said
the
baseball
cap
was
tribute
to
another
of
his
eclectic
concerns
the
statistics
of
that
particular
team
those
he
kept
on
a
computer
file
and
subjected
to
daily
updates
as
issac
mannheim
saw
it
he
was
the
undisputed
father
of
project
cyclops
bill
bates
was
merely
in
charge
of
its
delivery
room
down
on
andikythera
it
was
a
perhaps
but
not
entirely
untrue
either
he
had
dreamed
up
the
idea
and
proved
in
his
mit
lab
that
it
could
work
the
rest
he
figured
was
merely
scaling
it
up
which
any
dimwit
with
half
a
billion
dollars
could
do
with
ease
he
had
already
seen
to
the
hard
part
mannheim
liked
to
check
in
on
his
baby
every
other
week
just
to
make
sure
that
bates
who
was
going
to
make
a
fortune
off
his
idea
was
doing
it
right
although
the
long
flight
to
athens
and
then
the
helicopter
ride
down
to
andikythera
were
starting
to
make
him
feel
his
five
years
he
did
not
really
mind
when
you
my
age
he
claim
you
do
have
time
to
sit
around
on
your
butt
all
day
he
always
flew
british
air
from
london
rather
than
taking
a
direct
olympic
flight
from
boston
mainly
because
he
was
an
anglophile
but
also
because
he
was
quite
sure
he
trusted
greek
maintenance
isaac
mannheim
was
old
school
in
all
things
as
the
tires
screeched
onto
the
asphalt
he
glanced
out
the
window
again
marveling
how
small
the
athens
airport
was
but
then
his
mind
quickly
traveled
on
to
other
pressing
matters
namely
the
agenda
he
was
anxious
to
go
over
the
data
number
by
number
with
georges
lefarge
the
young
french
canadian
had
been
his
best
student
in
cambridge
ten
years
ago
and
isaac
mannheim
was
secretly
pleased
very
pleased
that
georges
had
been
given
a
leading
role
in
the
project
together
years
ago
they
had
ironed
out
many
of
the
technical
problems
in
the
system
the
work
back
then
had
been
done
on
a
lab
bench
and
a
shoestring
but
lefarge
knew
everything
that
could
go
wrong
with
georges
as
director
of
computer
systems
here
mannheim
knew
the
project
was
in
good
hands
at
least
the
crucial
computer
part
of
it
when
the
doors
opened
he
was
one
of
the
first
to
step
out
of
the
ba
and
down
the
steel
stairway
onto
the
runway
he
reflected
that
had
a
good
flight
this
time
with
only
an
hour
layover
in
infamously
crowded
terminal
four
now
as
the
airport
bus
arrived
to
carry
the
london
passengers
into
the
athens
terminal
he
anticipated
getting
an
early
start
on
the
day
he
glanced
down
toward
the
far
end
of
the
airport
the
civilian
aviation
terminal
expecting
to
catch
sight
of
bates
striped
agusta
helicopter
funny
he
could
see
it
today
usually
you
could
it
was
odd
they
were
always
here
waiting
customary
promptness
was
just
one
more
example
of
how
well
that
young
andros
was
handling
the
project
he
chafed
to
admit
it
but
she
was
pretty
damned
good
although
he
had
long
scoffed
at
the
idea
that
women
could
compete
successfully
with
male
engineers
he
had
to
admit
she
was
as
professional
as
any
male
project
manager
he
ever
worked
with
carrying
his
overstuffed
black
briefcase
in
his
left
hand
and
his
tattered
nylon
flight
bag
in
his
right
he
waited
till
the
airport
bus
was
almost
full
before
stepping
on
airport
buses
he
noted
as
an
engineer
operated
on
the
lifo
computer
storage
principle
last
in
first
out
no
random
access
and
he
was
indeed
first
out
as
they
pulled
into
the
sheltered
awning
of
the
terminal
the
athens
morning
sun
was
already
burning
through
the
growing
layer
of
brown
haze
he
thought
ruefully
how
it
would
look
from
the
south
down
around
piraeus
as
they
flew
out
from
there
athens
seemed
to
be
encased
in
an
ugly
brown
tomb
world
air
quality
was
yet
another
of
the
topics
weighing
on
his
mind
these
days
it
was
in
fact
a
frequent
subject
of
the
long
letters
he
addressed
to
another
former
student
an
danish
boy
majoring
in
physics
whom
he
had
seen
fit
to
flunk
in
thermodynamics
afterward
mannheim
had
taken
the
lad
aside
and
bluntly
suggested
he
might
wish
to
consider
a
less
intellectually
demanding
career
path
the
advice
had
been
heeded
and
these
days
he
was
doing
reasonably
well
at
his
cushy
new
job
down
in
washington
still
isaac
mannheim
felt
it
necessary
to
post
the
boy
long
typewritten
letters
from
time
to
time
concerning
various
avenues
for
yes
he
had
turned
out
reasonably
well
after
all
considering
but
he
still
needed
to
work
harder
do
be
a
slacker
john
nobody
ever
got
ahead
that
way
the
president
of
the
united
states
johan
hansen
read
his
old
professor
missives
usually
written
on
the
back
of
graph
paper
or
whatever
was
handy
and
dutifully
answered
every
one
of
them
maybe
he
was
afraid
he
get
another
f
and
a
humiliating
lecture
isaac
mannheim
stared
around
the
terminal
wondering
the
satcom
pilot
usually
met
him
right
at
the
gate
but
today
nobody
was
there
incompetent
greeks
this
one
in
fact
was
particularly
feckless
just
out
of
the
greek
air
force
with
no
real
grasp
of
the
value
of
time
or
had
andros
forgotten
he
was
arriving
that
was
hard
to
imagine
since
he
had
talked
with
her
just
before
he
left
cambridge
one
thing
you
had
to
say
for
her
she
never
forgot
appointments
strange
no
helicopter
no
pilot
damned
peculiar
he
had
no
alternative
but
to
phone
andros
on
her
private
line
he
walked
over
to
the
booth
near
the
entrance
to
the
terminal
lobby
and
got
some
drachmas
then
he
located
a
pay
phone
and
placed
the
call
she
answered
on
the
first
ring
good
cally
what
in
blazes
is
going
on
down
there
he
tried
to
open
the
conversation
as
diplomatically
as
he
knew
how
i
here
sitting
on
my
butt
in
the
athens
airport
as
though
i
had
nothing
else
to
do
i
see
alex
anywhere
or
the
agusta
you
going
to
have
to
get
rid
of
that
boy
if
this
happens
again
where
in
hell
are
they
a
long
uncomfortable
pause
ensued
and
it
sounded
as
though
she
was
listening
to
someone
else
finally
she
answered
in
a
shaky
voice
mannheim
it
been
a
very
long
night
here
maybe
you
well
how
did
the
go
i
need
to
go
over
the
data
with
georges
right
away
mannheim
maybe
the
phone
seemed
to
go
dead
then
she
came
back
on
the
mark
ii
is
temporarily
out
of
service
can
you
take
the
ferry
what
you
know
perfectly
well
that
damned
thing
only
runs
once
a
week
and
that
was
yesterday
now
what
about
the
agusta
it
it
just
not
possible
so
you
what
then
i
just
rent
one
here
it
cost
a
few
dollars
but
i
ca
wait
around
all
day
isaac
i
she
never
used
his
first
name
at
least
not
to
him
but
he
took
no
notice
do
worry
about
it
it
just
go
into
project
overhead
be
a
tax
for
bates
he
laughed
without
noticeable
humor
he
understands
all
about
such
things
awfully
expensive
she
said
her
voice
still
sounding
strange
maybe
it
be
better
to
wait
damn
it
i
be
there
in
a
couple
of
hours
mannheim
her
voice
would
have
sounded
an
alarm
to
most
people
but
then
most
people
listened
isaac
mannheim
rarely
bothered
especially
where
women
were
concerned
you
simply
did
what
had
to
be
done
it
was
that
simple
but
most
women
seemed
unable
to
fathom
matters
of
such
obvious
transparency
he
slammed
down
the
phone
and
strode
out
into
the
morning
sunshine
the
private
aviation
terminal
was
about
a
half
mile
down
an
road
but
he
decided
the
walk
would
do
him
good
the
breeze
would
feel
refreshing
after
the
smoky
stuffy
terminal
the
problem
was
athens
was
already
getting
hot
that
why
he
liked
the
islands
they
were
always
cooler
this
time
of
year
chapter
five
vance
stared
up
the
mountain
puzzled
the
silence
baffled
him
and
then
he
realized
why
he
was
not
hearing
the
usual
hum
of
transformers
nothing
was
operating
they
had
shut
down
the
power
he
heaved
a
sigh
then
dropped
down
beside
a
tree
trunk
and
clicked
out
the
magazine
of
the
black
uzi
it
had
about
fifteen
rounds
left
so
the
time
had
come
to
start
making
them
count
here
amid
the
brush
he
had
a
chance
to
lie
low
for
a
while
and
figure
out
what
to
do
next
besides
feeling
thirst
and
fatigue
he
had
a
throbbing
sprain
in
his
shoulder
incurred
somehow
during
the
crash
of
the
chopper
but
the
pain
was
helping
to
clear
his
mind
maybe
he
thought
he
could
find
some
provisions
stowed
in
the
hind
left
or
overlooked
a
stray
canteen
or
some
mres
but
did
he
want
to
risk
going
back
down
the
answer
was
yes
because
even
more
important
the
radio
might
still
be
operating
it
was
definitely
time
to
activate
the
warranty
on
this
job
but
first
things
first
who
are
these
creeps
hoping
to
find
out
something
he
pulled
out
the
leather
packet
he
had
retrieved
from
the
terrorist
torn
shirt
and
cracked
it
open
crumpled
inside
was
a
wad
of
yemeni
dinars
and
a
crinkled
id
card
in
german
on
the
back
was
a
phrase
scrawled
in
english
it
looked
like
the
resistance
front
for
a
free
it
was
smudged
but
yes
europe
back
when
he
and
bates
had
first
talked
about
the
security
question
bill
had
insisted
arm
focus
on
industrial
security
truthfully
there
had
been
any
real
thought
given
to
antiterrorist
measures
it
had
just
seemed
unimaginable
looked
at
another
way
though
bates
had
been
trying
to
be
had
gambled
on
an
assumption
now
it
was
beginning
to
look
as
though
that
had
been
a
bad
bet
although
for
a
setup
dimitri
handiwork
contracted
out
of
athens
was
it
had
made
no
provisions
against
aerial
penetration
from
land
or
sea
that
haunting
phrase
kept
coming
back
but
bill
had
laughed
it
off
and
the
client
was
always
supposed
to
be
right
besides
the
satcom
facility
already
had
a
nest
of
radars
up
on
the
hill
there
as
part
of
the
cyclops
and
also
to
monitor
the
local
weather
why
clutter
up
the
place
any
more
the
fact
was
these
guys
had
probably
come
in
under
the
facility
electronic
eyes
anyway
using
the
hind
ability
to
detect
an
interrogation
and
keep
low
enough
to
avoid
a
significant
radar
signature
the
background
noise
from
the
choppy
sea
must
have
been
enough
to
mask
their
approach
maybe
spiros
should
have
considered
that
but
at
this
point
such
meditations
amounted
to
quarterbacking
so
now
the
parameters
of
the
job
had
changed
from
industrial
security
to
counterterrorism
satcom
was
fortunate
in
its
choice
of
security
services
because
an
arm
job
always
came
with
a
guarantee
if
a
problem
came
up
the
boys
would
be
there
immediately
to
solve
it
which
meant
that
alerting
paris
was
now
his
first
priority
until
reinforcements
arrived
though
he
was
arm
lots
of
problems
came
to
mind
first
off
he
was
operating
on
the
perimeter
he
had
no
map
of
the
facility
no
idea
where
to
find
the
hostages
however
the
communications
station
up
the
hill
represented
a
redoubt
he
probably
could
defend
reasonably
well
unless
they
brought
up
some
really
heavy
artillery
maybe
there
would
be
some
way
to
disrupt
the
proceedings
provide
a
diversion
sooner
or
later
he
figured
there
bound
to
be
some
action
out
of
the
air
and
naval
base
down
at
souda
bay
on
crete
hopefully
somebody
down
at
gournes
had
picked
up
his
mayday
but
even
if
they
had
could
they
send
in
a
team
this
was
greek
soil
and
greeks
tended
to
be
fussy
about
their
sovereignty
now
that
nato
had
no
idea
what
its
new
mission
was
america
heavy
presence
in
europe
more
and
more
looked
like
yankee
imperialism
they
might
convince
the
greeks
to
let
them
bring
in
the
navy
seals
or
even
the
antiterrorist
delta
force
from
fort
bragg
in
fayetteville
north
carolina
but
that
would
require
a
lot
of
negotiation
might
take
days
time
could
run
out
by
then
and
the
greeks
had
no
capability
themselves
to
do
anything
but
make
matters
worse
he
looked
down
the
hill
toward
the
wreckage
of
the
hind
okay
he
thought
time
to
see
about
that
radio
slowly
he
rose
chambered
a
round
in
the
uzi
with
a
hard
click
and
started
through
the
brush
the
greek
scrub
tore
through
his
thin
shirt
and
rasped
at
his
skin
while
the
morning
sun
glimmering
off
the
proud
silver
spires
of
the
vehicles
at
the
other
end
of
the
island
beat
down
the
island
remained
eerily
calm
the
sleep
of
the
dead
the
takeover
was
complete
no
question
about
that
through
the
brush
the
wreckage
of
the
hind
showed
its
mottled
coloring
a
mix
of
grays
and
tans
among
the
green
of
the
branches
as
he
approached
he
could
discern
no
sign
of
his
attackers
which
either
meant
they
were
pros
and
lying
in
wait
for
him
or
they
were
amateurs
and
had
fled
he
looked
around
the
copse
of
scrub
cypress
then
gingerly
stepped
through
the
open
doorway
by
some
miracle
the
electronics
were
still
lined
up
in
rows
of
readiness
lights
and
leds
glowing
a
tough
bird
and
the
radio
was
still
operating
and
on
dawn
had
long
since
ripened
the
clear
blue
of
the
sky
and
he
could
feel
the
beat
of
warm
sunshine
on
the
shattered
bubble
of
the
canopy
now
he
knew
the
terrorists
would
be
scanning
the
military
frequencies
so
it
was
time
to
be
circumspect
and
use
some
caution
for
a
change
he
checked
it
over
good
it
had
sideband
that
was
perfect
because
he
figured
they
probably
would
monitor
those
offbeat
marine
frequencies
if
he
could
raise
spiros
in
athens
he
could
then
contact
paris
they
could
put
together
a
team
overnight
and
fly
it
down
he
fiddled
with
the
sideband
channels
hoping
he
heard
some
amateur
action
and
a
funny
he
thought
that
the
minute
yachtsmen
put
to
sea
they
anxious
to
get
in
contact
with
someone
on
dry
land
what
would
ulysses
have
done
with
a
shortwave
radio
talked
back
to
the
sirens
the
broadcasts
however
were
mainly
about
the
weather
sailors
did
not
waste
their
time
on
world
events
when
that
news
finally
trickled
down
however
these
sideband
channels
would
probably
no
longer
be
safe
to
use
maybe
they
were
now
but
he
had
to
take
the
risk
he
tried
a
few
frequencies
and
then
he
got
lucky
it
was
a
greek
ham
operator
probably
having
a
second
cup
of
strong
native
coffee
and
waiting
for
the
traffic
in
athens
to
subside
as
are
all
amateurs
he
was
delighted
to
talk
he
sounded
youthful
and
enthusiastic
eager
to
help
i
read
you
ulysses
you
coming
in
loud
and
clear
on
ssb
megahertz
this
is
athens
what
is
your
callsign
do
have
a
handle
vance
replied
into
the
mike
in
greek
this
is
a
mayday
i
copy
the
voice
suddenly
grew
serious
what
is
your
location
he
paused
a
second
wondering
what
to
say
no
he
could
take
a
chance
who
knew
who
else
was
listening
in
do
have
that
either
what
i
need
is
a
phone
patch
to
a
number
in
athens
can
you
set
it
up
no
problem
came
the
confident
response
using
the
international
english
phrase
vance
tried
to
imagine
what
he
looked
like
probably
with
the
swagger
acquired
by
all
young
greek
men
along
with
their
first
motor
scooter
they
wanted
to
impress
you
with
how
wonderful
their
country
was
and
they
also
wanted
you
to
know
that
they
were
the
biggest
stud
in
all
the
land
but
whoever
you
want
may
be
gone
to
work
by
now
this
guy
probably
wo
even
be
out
of
bed
yet
he
a
night
owl
vance
replied
into
the
mike
he
did
add
that
the
best
thing
dimitri
did
at
night
was
handle
an
h
k
it
athens
city
code
and
the
number
is
he
knew
that
spiros
kept
a
lovely
whitewashed
house
on
the
western
side
of
town
just
out
of
the
major
smog
centers
moments
later
the
patch
was
through
and
he
had
spiros
on
the
radio
the
patch
was
scratchy
and
hill
of
static
but
not
so
much
he
hear
michael
you
woke
me
up
i
hope
the
world
just
ended
it
was
gruff
voice
a
veteran
of
an
antiterrorist
unit
in
brussels
he
was
as
tough
as
he
sounded
by
the
way
everybody
heard
about
that
stunt
of
yours
are
you
in
trouble
already
got
a
pool
going
on
you
i
have
ten
thousand
drachmas
saying
never
make
it
i
appreciate
the
confidence
anyway
you
can
start
spending
the
money
you
be
relieved
to
know
i
blew
it
she
sank
on
me
bad
he
laughed
so
what
was
the
problem
mostly
it
was
some
fire
took
the
wind
right
out
of
her
sails
i
took
a
swim
and
then
i
think
a
euclid
finished
her
off
russian
the
voice
quickly
grew
serious
sounds
like
vou
made
the
wrong
people
mad
who
in
hell
did
it
do
know
but
they
very
meticulous
about
their
work
they
used
a
approach
and
shelled
an
american
frigate
down
here
north
of
crete
should
be
making
the
news
any
time
now
sounds
like
somebody
getting
hot
about
inviting
the
sixth
fleet
out
of
the
med
then
spiros
pensive
tone
turned
businesslike
are
you
okay
where
are
you
now
i
fine
i
think
but
you
got
to
get
some
of
the
boys
down
here
what
do
you
mean
remember
that
job
you
did
for
bill
bates
maybe
he
thought
we
can
talk
around
the
problem
looks
like
the
security
did
stick
that
was
a
good
job
spiros
said
with
a
growl
need
some
updating
it
going
to
be
a
little
more
than
that
i
think
maybe
a
dozen
hostiles
give
or
take
came
in
by
chopper
a
had
all
the
factory
extras
had
it
just
met
with
an
accident
and
i
bet
you
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
he
laughed
so
what
kind
of
hardware
do
they
have
uzis
for
sure
probably
also
some
grenade
launchers
also
light
machine
guns
the
odds
are
good
they
going
to
be
here
for
a
while
they
dug
in
and
it
a
long
swim
to
anywhere
should
we
be
having
this
conversation
on
the
phone
caution
was
entering
his
voice
can
we
secure
up
these
communications
bight
now
we
got
no
choice
vance
answered
nothing
where
i
am
is
secure
including
my
skin
he
thought
all
right
then
give
it
to
me
fast
he
was
all
business
what
do
you
have
on
nationality
it
has
a
beirut
feel
about
it
but
i
managed
to
get
some
material
off
one
of
them
and
i
think
he
was
a
former
east
german
stasi
type
whoever
they
are
they
operating
under
some
phony
front
name
i
read
you
usual
terrorist
mo
best
i
can
tell
we
have
to
worry
about
civilians
that
going
to
make
it
tougher
bill
may
be
among
them
and
all
his
staff
bad
news
he
a
prize
what
do
you
think
their
game
is
spiros
asked
after
a
pause
ransom
that
he
my
first
guess
though
it
does
synch
with
the
attack
on
the
ship
unless
it
was
intended
as
a
deliberate
diversion
maybe
they
planning
something
else
but
my
hunch
is
money
involved
anyway
we
find
out
soon
enough
you
damned
right
we
will
the
line
was
silent
for
a
moment
as
static
intervened
well
this
will
teach
us
to
guarantee
our
work
it
going
to
be
an
expensive
insurance
policy
nothing
in
life
is
supposed
to
be
easy
so
we
keep
finding
out
he
seemed
to
be
thinking
you
know
i
sent
the
layout
to
paris
when
the
job
was
finished
for
the
files
he
did
want
to
mention
pierre
armont
the
head
of
arm
on
an
unsecured
line
i
see
what
the
office
there
can
get
together
for
us
do
we
have
any
people
left
on
site
vance
asked
just
contract
spiros
responded
locals
and
probably
not
worth
much
well
whoever
they
are
chances
are
good
they
been
neutralized
by
now
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
fear
the
worst
that
our
motto
assume
everything
will
go
to
hell
and
then
work
around
it
time
to
get
off
the
air
i
try
to
raise
you
at
hours
on
megahertz
by
that
time
you
better
have
the
team
lined
up
and
ready
to
move
in
i
owe
bates
this
one
a
nice
clean
job
right
who
do
you
think
we
ought
to
use
anybody
who
worked
on
the
security
here
would
be
good
got
to
be
me
spiros
said
ruefully
okay
beyond
that
we
need
a
swat
team
this
one
is
going
to
be
rough
we
need
somebody
who
can
handle
explosives
like
a
brain
surgeon
maybe
marcel
out
of
antwerp
get
him
if
you
can
find
him
sober
also
we
probably
could
use
a
negotiator
somebody
who
can
keep
them
busy
while
we
get
the
real
insertion
in
place
and
a
good
sniper
will
be
essential
lots
of
friendlies
okay
that
sounds
like
reggie
i
run
some
names
past
paris
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
in
the
meantime
well
they
know
i
here
but
they
do
know
who
i
am
concentrate
on
staying
alive
and
try
to
find
out
whatever
i
can
about
the
mo
catch
you
at
talk
to
you
then
dimitri
said
and
hung
up
right
vance
thought
i
definitely
rather
be
in
philadelphia
it
a
go
in
five
caroline
shaeffer
announced
in
a
stage
whisper
leaning
over
his
shoulder
a
blond
ohio
debutante
she
was
press
secretary
a
job
she
had
fought
for
and
loved
and
she
structured
the
president
media
appearances
with
the
bloodless
efficiency
of
a
nazi
drill
sergeant
this
hastily
arranged
breakfast
speech
at
new
plaza
was
no
different
she
had
put
it
together
in
less
than
ten
days
and
anybody
who
mattered
in
new
york
politics
was
in
attendance
smiling
their
way
dirough
stale
con
melone
soggy
eggs
benedict
for
an
hour
of
quality
time
with
president
johan
hansen
the
head
table
had
the
usual
crowd
mayor
jarvis
senators
representatives
state
senators
state
officials
of
every
stripe
even
the
borough
presidents
hansen
was
almost
as
popular
as
ronald
reagan
had
been
in
his
heyday
the
election
was
coming
up
in
less
than
six
weeks
and
johan
hansen
held
a
commanding
lead
points
if
you
believed
the
latest
poll
a
nonpolitical
event
in
the
middle
of
the
campaign
allowed
everybody
to
show
up
for
a
photo
regardless
of
party
president
hansen
speech
was
scheduled
to
begin
at
sharp
perfectly
timed
to
let
today
and
good
morning
america
carry
the
opening
remarks
live
eastern
and
central
and
not
have
to
look
like
the
networks
were
trailing
cnn
indeed
wiping
its
ass
yet
again
in
any
case
it
would
definitely
make
the
evening
news
on
all
three
precisely
as
hansen
intended
johan
hansen
whose
perfect
white
hair
and
granite
chin
made
him
look
every
inch
a
chief
of
state
had
mixed
feelings
about
his
trips
to
the
big
apple
he
relished
the
automatic
media
attention
they
received
caroline
claimed
that
whereas
network
anchors
usually
considered
themselves
above
travel
in
new
york
one
or
two
might
deign
to
show
up
but
chafed
at
the
mechanics
the
helicopters
traffic
jams
awesome
security
he
also
despised
political
food
which
was
why
caroline
had
packed
his
own
private
breakfast
of
shredded
wheat
and
skimmed
milk
to
be
downed
discreetly
while
everybody
else
was
busy
clogging
their
arteries
he
was
speaking
on
worldwide
nuclear
disarmament
and
he
intended
his
address
to
be
a
for
one
at
the
united
nations
general
assembly
three
weeks
hence
which
meant
another
damned
trip
to
new
york
alter
opening
with
his
standard
stump
remarks
all
partisan
digs
excised
he
would
then
go
on
to
assure
his
audience
that
the
new
world
truly
was
here
which
always
got
everybody
in
a
receptive
mood
he
would
then
remind
them
that
three
years
earlier
when
i
assumed
this
office
america
was
still
spending
billion
a
year
on
new
nuclear
warheads
he
had
put
an
end
to
that
but
now
it
was
time
to
take
the
next
step
total
nuclear
disarmament
worldwide
it
was
a
stance
that
normally
received
polite
applause
at
best
and
stony
silence
at
worst
but
it
never
failed
to
make
the
news
this
morning
the
broadcast
networks
and
cnn
had
combined
their
resources
after
all
the
space
was
limited
to
provide
pool
coverage
although
the
usual
ganglia
of
lights
and
wires
were
reduced
to
an
absolute
minimum
the
back
of
the
room
still
looked
like
a
makeshift
convention
bureau
the
broadcast
correspondents
all
had
their
own
instant
analysis
cameras
set
up
and
the
print
people
were
all
next
to
their
own
newly
installed
dedicated
phones
johan
hansen
acquisition
of
the
oval
office
had
come
at
the
end
of
a
election
battle
that
saw
several
firsts
in
american
politics
for
one
thing
it
proved
finally
that
america
truly
was
the
land
of
opportunity
he
was
a
danish
american
and
he
was
jewish
the
latter
being
a
part
of
his
heritage
that
seldom
if
ever
got
press
play
he
scarcely
noticed
either
in
truth
it
was
only
on
his
father
side
which
in
judaism
did
not
really
count
hansen
father
joost
had
been
a
young
copenhagen
college
student
in
when
the
people
of
denmark
one
night
heroically
evacuated
all
the
country
jews
to
sweden
out
of
the
looming
grasp
of
the
nazis
shortly
thereafter
he
had
married
hansen
mother
a
swede
named
erica
who
had
helped
in
the
evacuation
and
then
after
the
war
they
had
immigrated
to
america
joost
hansen
had
finished
his
doctorate
in
physics
at
princeton
being
a
promising
physicist
was
one
of
the
reasons
he
could
so
readily
get
into
the
united
states
and
then
had
gone
to
work
at
los
alamos
on
the
liner
that
brought
them
the
birth
of
johan
hansen
was
due
any
minute
and
one
hour
after
it
docked
on
the
pier
on
the
west
side
of
new
york
he
came
bawling
into
the
world
a
citizen
and
thereby
eligible
by
a
matter
of
minutes
to
be
president
someday
who
could
have
known
young
johan
remembered
little
of
princeton
new
jersey
but
in
los
alamos
he
had
gloried
in
the
clear
air
of
the
mountains
had
loved
the
old
white
sands
rocket
test
area
where
they
vacationed
had
loved
everything
about
america
he
gone
on
to
try
engineering
at
m
it
but
he
had
soon
realized
he
did
have
the
makings
to
follow
in
his
father
technical
footsteps
he
cared
too
much
about
human
affairs
to
stay
in
the
bloodless
world
of
formulas
and
machines
as
a
result
he
shifted
to
political
science
and
after
graduating
he
became
an
aide
to
one
of
massachusetts
liberal
congressmen
eventually
he
ran
for
the
house
on
his
own
the
democratic
primary
was
a
model
of
boston
politics
but
he
won
a
squeaker
and
became
a
member
at
thus
began
a
career
that
continued
through
the
senate
and
after
two
terms
to
the
presidency
he
had
achieved
his
ambitions
and
his
soaring
popularity
was
all
the
more
amazing
for
accruing
to
a
man
who
had
restructured
the
military
during
the
painful
transition
of
the
united
states
to
a
economy
turning
swords
into
plowshares
was
never
as
easy
as
it
sounded
but
america
excess
armaments
capacity
had
gone
back
to
reinvigorate
her
sectors
if
you
could
make
an
he
had
declared
you
could
make
anything
now
retool
and
get
on
with
it
america
had
in
his
most
important
contribution
to
history
however
john
hansen
had
presided
over
the
dismantling
of
more
than
half
the
world
nuclear
arsenal
it
easy
he
declared
to
the
russians
we
just
do
nothing
and
in
so
doing
the
tritium
in
all
those
warheads
will
simply
decay
end
of
bombs
you
monitor
our
plants
at
oak
ridge
and
savannah
river
we
monitor
you
and
together
we
watch
the
nuclear
threat
to
humanity
simply
tick
away
it
was
working
he
often
noted
with
pride
maybe
we
not
going
to
melt
the
planet
after
all
not
only
would
future
generations
thank
him
there
would
be
future
generations
but
would
they
know
enough
history
to
appreciate
what
he
done
he
wondered
ruefully
only
if
the
dismal
state
of
american
education
could
be
improved
it
was
now
and
the
television
lights
had
been
switched
on
turning
the
fake
gold
leaf
on
the
ceiling
into
an
intense
white
the
teleprompter
had
been
readied
and
the
secret
service
detail
was
making
checks
around
the
room
as
unobtrusively
as
conditions
would
permit
correspondents
for
their
own
part
were
poring
over
an
advance
copy
of
the
text
that
caroline
aide
had
just
passed
out
making
notes
for
the
brief
question
period
scheduled
to
follow
the
time
was
when
she
walked
up
behind
him
and
laid
down
a
large
gray
envelope
marked
top
secret
it
was
she
whispered
a
couple
of
pages
fresh
off
the
secure
fax
that
had
been
installed
in
the
room
just
down
the
hall
what
was
it
he
wondered
some
revisions
by
jordan
mccormick
a
young
new
speechwriter
from
harvard
who
liked
to
tinker
till
the
very
last
minute
puzzled
he
ripped
open
the
envelope
the
first
page
was
a
covering
memo
from
his
personal
secretary
alicia
winston
miss
winston
as
she
insisted
on
being
called
was
a
spinster
eight
who
guarded
access
to
johan
hansen
with
the
ferocity
of
a
pit
bull
get
past
her
junior
members
of
congress
often
declared
and
you
home
free
it
was
however
more
often
a
dream
than
a
realization
seduction
was
frequently
discussed
alicia
note
was
brief
and
pointed
the
second
page
it
said
was
a
copy
of
a
fax
that
had
just
arrived
on
her
desk
from
ed
briggs
head
of
the
joint
chiefs
hansen
chief
of
staff
morton
davies
had
asked
her
to
fax
it
on
to
new
york
immediately
they
both
knew
morton
was
not
a
man
to
squander
time
hansen
glanced
over
to
see
a
white
phone
complete
with
scrambler
being
nestled
next
to
the
official
text
of
his
speech
when
he
scanned
the
second
sheet
he
knew
why
he
on
the
line
caroline
said
he
nodded
and
checked
his
watch
eight
shit
caroline
tell
them
there
been
a
hold
and
see
if
you
can
have
them
kill
those
damned
lights
you
got
it
she
signaled
to
the
pool
producer
pointed
to
the
lights
and
made
a
slashing
motion
across
her
throat
with
a
puzzled
nod
he
immediately
complied
barking
an
order
to
his
lighting
director
hansen
picked
up
the
phone
ed
what
the
hell
is
this
about
looking
at
the
fax
you
say
this
happened
over
six
hours
ago
president
that
came
in
about
ten
minutes
ago
from
naval
intel
they
been
trying
to
get
the
story
straight
the
bbc
was
carrying
a
rumor
but
it
was
soft
we
wanted
to
get
all
the
facts
before
it
was
in
the
med
hansen
impatiently
cut
him
off
why
so
long
they
claim
they
took
all
this
time
trying
to
nail
down
responsible
and
they
still
do
know
for
sure
all
they
got
hard
is
what
i
sent
you
a
frigate
under
contract
to
nsa
got
hit
about
fifty
known
casualties
it
could
be
our
friends
the
israelis
up
to
their
old
tricks
or
it
could
be
somebody
who
wants
us
to
think
them
ed
i
staring
down
half
the
press
in
the
country
right
now
as
we
speak
i
ca
do
anything
till
i
get
back
but
check
with
alicia
i
think
i
scheduled
in
around
noon
and
i
like
to
try
and
have
a
statement
out
by
three
today
all
right
president
we
do
what
we
can
let
me
morton
everything
i
got
so
far
and
he
can
forward
anything
he
thinks
might
help
but
we
got
to
talk
this
could
be
a
tough
call
what
are
the
israelis
saying
military
intel
told
morton
they
do
know
a
damned
thing
about
it
but
their
embassy
here
already
on
red
alert
getting
ready
to
start
pushing
out
smoke
hansen
had
no
love
for
israel
in
his
view
their
intransigence
had
caused
the
lion
share
of
america
problems
in
the
middle
east
they
never
told
the
truth
about
anything
until
three
days
later
when
it
was
too
late
to
matter
in
the
meantime
they
just
did
whatever
they
wanted
well
this
time
i
almost
think
they
may
be
straight
briggs
said
it
does
have
any
of
their
trademarks
for
one
thing
it
had
their
name
all
over
it
not
their
style
hansen
scanned
the
fax
again
noting
the
top
secret
across
the
top
and
tried
to
make
it
sink
in
concentration
was
difficult
considering
the
expectant
stirrings
in
the
room
the
clank
of
silverware
but
this
was
nothing
short
of
a
major
episode
what
did
it
mean
okay
ed
i
want
to
see
you
first
thing
and
bring
bob
with
you
robert
barnes
was
his
assistant
navy
in
case
we
need
to
scramble
out
of
crete
roger
sir
i
have
alicia
get
everything
we
need
set
up
in
the
sit
room
good
hansen
hung
up
the
phone
and
looked
around
the
room
damn
who
was
trying
to
screw
up
the
med
already
he
had
a
bad
feeling
it
might
involve
terrorists
but
where
did
they
get
the
soviet
helicopter
okay
he
told
himself
time
to
call
in
all
the
heavy
guns
all
the
advisers
who
get
paid
so
much
to
do
your
thinking
he
would
face
his
first
problem
when
the
press
got
hold
of
the
story
he
could
already
see
the
cartoons
that
bastard
in
the
washington
times
who
was
always
accusing
him
of
being
a
pansy
on
defense
they
want
blood
an
eye
for
an
eye
while
he
was
trying
his
best
to
change
that
way
of
thinking
this
latest
stupidity
damned
sure
was
going
to
make
it
any
easier
with
that
grim
thought
he
smiled
his
widest
smile
and
signaled
caroline
to
alert
the
pool
producer
to
switch
on
the
television
lights
what
happened
ramirez
asked
helling
had
alerted
him
by
talkie
and
summoned
him
to
the
lobby
there
the
germans
were
returning
henes
sommer
covered
with
blood
and
being
carried
by
rudolph
schindler
and
peter
maier
henes
got
caught
in
a
firefight
then
he
tried
to
take
the
chopper
and
fell
schindler
was
struggling
to
find
the
words
thinking
that
he
would
have
to
be
the
one
to
tell
henes
wife
in
what
used
to
be
east
berlin
henes
sommer
had
joined
ramirez
operation
out
of
idealism
as
a
step
toward
driving
the
zionist
scourge
from
europe
ramirez
had
made
the
operation
sound
so
easy
it
even
worse
helling
said
slowly
addressing
his
words
to
ramirez
he
must
have
been
a
guard
who
escaped
our
notice
but
he
managed
to
start
the
hind
then
he
crashed
it
against
the
hillside
why
did
you
go
after
him
and
kill
him
ramirez
asked
quietly
his
anger
smoldering
there
was
no
need
he
trapped
up
there
for
now
he
can
rot
an
uncomfortable
pause
ensued
before
he
continued
besides
he
armed
we
probably
should
wait
till
nightfall
what
can
he
do
he
can
do
a
lot
ramirez
was
thinking
this
could
be
trouble
the
three
germans
had
been
brought
along
as
a
favor
to
wolf
helling
and
now
they
had
demonstrated
just
how
worthless
they
actually
were
under
ordinary
circumstances
he
would
have
shot
them
all
on
the
spot
as
an
example
to
the
rest
of
the
team
you
say
the
hind
has
been
crashed
he
went
on
his
eyes
hidden
behind
his
shades
we
do
need
it
any
more
what
does
that
matter
helling
shrugged
not
sure
he
believed
his
own
words
in
any
case
this
is
what
comes
of
having
amateurs
involved
schindler
eyes
darkened
in
resentment
it
had
never
really
occurred
to
him
until
this
moment
that
his
and
his
friends
lives
were
at
risk
ramirez
was
trying
hard
to
mask
his
own
chagrin
telling
himself
he
should
never
have
sent
these
untried
goons
out
to
do
a
man
work
a
good
attorney
never
asked
a
question
in
court
that
he
did
already
know
the
answer
to
and
you
never
turned
your
back
on
an
operation
if
you
were
already
fully
certain
how
it
would
turn
out
that
was
one
mistake
he
did
plan
to
make
again
life
is
never
simple
he
said
turning
back
to
the
german
threesome
the
wounded
man
was
wheezing
from
a
hole
in
his
chest
there
only
one
thing
to
do
with
him
he
withdrew
a
walther
from
inside
his
coat
and
with
great
precision
shot
henes
sommer
directly
between
the
eyes
as
calmly
as
though
dispatching
a
racehorse
with
a
broken
leg
the
body
slumped
into
the
arms
of
rudolph
schindler
who
looked
on
in
horror
it
was
merely
a
minor
miscalculation
but
now
it
been
handled
he
turned
to
helling
now
go
back
and
watch
the
hill
and
try
to
act
like
a
professional
the
german
nodded
he
dared
not
tell
ramirez
the
true
extent
of
their
trouble
not
only
had
the
mysterious
stranger
escaped
with
henes
uzi
he
also
still
might
have
a
radio
if
the
hind
had
not
been
totally
wrecked
helling
their
boss
did
seem
yet
aware
of
this
problem
if
it
was
still
working
what
would
he
do
now
ramirez
continued
rather
than
waste
our
time
on
fruitless
recriminations
we
must
proceed
he
turned
and
walked
back
through
the
doors
leading
into
command
across
the
room
past
the
rows
of
computer
terminals
bates
sat
at
the
main
command
desk
talking
to
andros
problem
bates
asked
looking
up
although
he
had
not
slept
all
night
his
blue
blazer
remained
immaculate
having
some
trouble
you
son
of
a
bitch
you
will
be
relieved
to
know
nothing
is
amiss
ramirez
replied
as
smoothly
as
he
could
manage
one
of
your
guards
it
would
seem
decided
to
make
a
nuisance
of
himself
but
he
has
been
neutralized
bates
did
not
believe
it
he
had
overheard
the
broadcast
on
the
bbc
and
now
he
was
starting
to
put
it
all
together
these
thugs
had
come
in
by
chopper
after
attacking
a
ship
they
must
have
left
the
attack
helicopter
out
on
the
pad
but
somebody
got
to
it
now
miss
andros
ramirez
lifted
a
clipboard
from
her
desk
and
examined
it
my
my
today
we
all
have
a
busy
schedule
review
the
test
data
from
the
final
calibrations
of
the
cyclops
flight
prep
of
the
vehicle
he
put
it
down
yes
it
does
look
like
a
busy
day
for
us
all
all
you
have
to
do
is
cooperate
and
no
one
here
will
be
harmed
the
second
chopper
is
on
its
way
now
he
was
thinking
if
everything
was
on
schedule
the
next
item
was
the
launch
vehicle
he
estimated
they
would
need
a
day
and
a
half
to
make
the
retrofit
the
scheduled
first
test
launch
had
been
programmed
for
three
days
away
now
it
was
two
so
there
was
ample
time
exactly
as
he
had
planned
vance
leaned
back
against
the
scrub
cypress
and
listened
to
the
whistle
of
the
light
wind
through
the
granite
outcroppings
he
had
perched
himself
on
one
of
the
rugged
cliffs
from
which
he
could
see
virtually
everything
that
went
on
aboveground
around
him
ants
crawled
oblivious
to
the
heat
of
the
sun
which
now
seared
the
rocks
on
all
sides
while
down
below
the
languorous
surf
beckoned
how
ironic
and
tragic
all
the
violence
and
killing
right
here
in
the
middle
of
paradise
he
had
managed
to
remove
the
radio
from
the
hind
it
would
serve
as
his
lifeline
to
the
rest
of
the
world
the
military
channels
were
all
scrambled
now
which
told
him
that
plenty
was
going
on
out
there
over
the
blue
horizon
trouble
was
all
communications
had
been
secured
he
had
no
idea
what
was
happening
what
the
hell
to
do
next
he
was
barefoot
with
nothing
but
an
uzi
a
and
a
radio
he
felt
waves
of
grogginess
ripple
over
him
as
the
sun
continued
to
climb
he
was
dead
tired
and
in
spite
of
himself
he
sensed
his
mind
drifting
in
the
heat
his
body
losing
its
edge
pulling
himself
together
he
snapped
alert
this
was
no
time
to
ease
up
he
noticed
that
some
of
the
men
had
left
the
command
section
and
gone
down
to
launch
control
the
sector
they
were
carrying
now
much
better
for
sniper
work
they
know
i
only
got
an
uzi
he
reminded
himself
which
is
why
they
realize
they
in
no
danger
from
up
here
it
be
next
to
useless
but
with
a
scope
those
kalashnikovs
are
bad
news
at
that
moment
he
heard
a
dull
roar
coming
in
from
the
south
was
it
somebody
who
picked
up
his
radio
mayday
he
squinted
against
the
sun
and
tried
to
see
as
he
watched
a
dark
mottled
shape
appeared
over
the
blue
horizon
it
was
another
helicopter
not
a
hind
this
time
as
it
came
in
for
a
landing
at
the
pad
down
by
launch
control
vance
checked
it
over
it
was
a
sikorsky
military
with
a
main
rotor
almost
sixty
feet
across
a
retractable
tricycle
landing
gear
and
a
rear
cargo
ramp
it
went
back
to
the
sixties
the
had
used
them
to
lift
astronauts
from
the
sea
but
it
was
a
warhorse
and
reliable
as
hell
it
had
an
amphibious
hull
twin
general
electric
turboshaft
engines
located
up
close
to
the
drive
gearbox
and
an
advanced
control
system
whether
or
not
this
one
had
the
latest
bells
and
whistles
he
did
know
its
speed
was
over
a
hundred
and
sixty
miles
per
hour
and
its
range
was
over
six
hundred
miles
what
that
all
about
he
wondered
is
this
the
getaway
car
whatever
it
was
they
were
not
landing
on
the
regular
pad
they
were
putting
her
down
as
close
as
they
could
to
the
vehicles
no
he
decided
what
they
doing
is
setting
up
something
getting
ready
for
the
big
show
he
already
had
a
feeling
he
knew
what
it
was
going
to
be
the
modus
was
standard
operating
procedure
but
this
was
going
to
be
a
waiting
game
at
least
for
a
while
and
he
thought
about
trying
to
catch
a
couple
of
winks
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
now
he
have
to
wait
till
dark
to
pass
the
time
he
clicked
on
the
radio
again
to
see
if
they
were
using
after
scanning
the
civilian
channels
he
finally
got
a
burst
of
traffic
they
were
chatting
all
right
a
lot
of
coded
talk
in
a
mixture
of
german
english
and
french
he
paused
a
minute
even
picked
up
the
mike
attached
by
a
coiled
black
cord
to
the
radio
and
pushed
the
red
button
but
then
he
thought
better
of
it
and
clicked
it
off
the
time
would
come
soon
enough
to
get
in
on
the
fun
but
not
yet
jamal
khan
the
younger
brother
of
salim
watched
as
the
sikorsky
set
down
then
pushed
the
starter
button
on
the
white
electric
cart
urging
it
to
life
this
was
the
moment
he
had
been
waiting
for
nothing
he
had
ever
done
in
years
past
matched
up
to
this
not
even
the
airline
hijackings
the
only
drawback
was
his
comrades
like
for
example
this
israeli
peretz
dore
peretz
for
his
own
part
waited
until
the
cart
a
site
mover
had
started
and
then
he
swung
onto
the
back
neither
spoke
as
they
silently
motored
through
the
sunshine
the
breeze
in
their
hair
headed
for
the
helo
the
sparkling
morning
did
not
improve
the
atmosphere
between
the
two
men
only
the
sunshine
contributed
warmth
to
the
moment
peretz
had
contempt
for
the
iranian
arrogance
and
intensity
the
bearded
iranian
resented
the
israeli
technical
skills
his
attitude
and
the
fact
that
he
was
israeli
none
of
it
could
easily
be
forgiven
jamal
further
could
not
forgive
the
israeli
for
having
no
commitment
to
driving
the
americans
from
the
middle
east
for
being
here
only
for
the
money
when
they
reached
the
sikorsky
now
settled
on
the
tarmac
jamal
pulled
the
cart
to
a
halt
then
switched
off
the
motor
and
stepped
down
it
would
take
all
hands
to
manage
the
helling
and
the
two
other
germans
were
already
waiting
in
the
sunshine
and
as
jamal
looked
them
over
he
found
himself
liking
them
even
less
than
he
did
peretz
the
truth
was
they
were
little
more
than
bureaucrats
regardless
of
whatever
they
called
themselves
they
ranted
about
america
being
the
prisoner
of
the
zionists
but
it
was
just
rhetoric
the
door
of
the
sikorsky
was
opening
now
and
abdoullah
the
first
of
the
three
pakistani
engineers
was
emerging
followed
by
rais
and
shujat
all
three
had
their
dark
hair
swathed
in
a
traditional
palestinian
black
and
white
part
of
their
disguise
jamal
tried
not
to
smile
as
he
watched
them
college
boys
awkwardly
slam
clips
into
their
uzis
and
look
around
as
though
they
were
about
to
lead
an
assault
it
was
a
wonderful
joke
abdoullah
actually
had
a
in
nuclear
engineering
from
berkeley
while
in
america
he
had
developed
a
taste
for
the
good
life
cars
designer
clothes
and
gold
jewelry
and
then
when
he
came
back
and
went
to
work
at
kahuta
pakistan
uranium
enrichment
plant
he
had
discovered
sex
the
instrument
of
this
discovery
was
a
palestinian
girl
ramala
whose
fiery
politics
were
matched
only
by
her
skills
in
bed
he
became
a
convert
to
her
and
then
to
her
cause
which
played
directly
into
the
hands
of
ramirez
ramirez
had
jamal
knew
been
working
on
this
setup
for
five
years
money
here
information
there
it
all
had
finally
paid
off
of
all
ramirez
recruits
abdoullah
contribution
had
been
the
most
crucial
since
he
had
been
the
one
who
had
arranged
the
theft
of
the
two
items
now
crated
and
ready
in
the
cargo
bay
of
the
sikorsky
he
and
his
two
spoke
english
by
choice
and
to
jamal
they
looked
almost
identical
all
with
new
beards
and
designer
commando
sweatbands
under
their
they
were
trying
to
get
with
the
look
of
revolutionary
chic
he
thought
with
disdain
just
made
the
big
time
but
they
still
thought
they
were
in
a
chuck
norris
movie
fortunately
they
already
served
their
main
purpose
in
two
more
days
they
would
be
totally
expendable
the
sikorsky
had
landed
approximately
fifty
yards
from
the
entrance
to
the
blockhouse
of
the
launch
facility
placing
them
a
mere
two
hundred
yards
away
from
the
satcom
space
vehicles
and
those
spires
seemed
to
preside
over
everything
casting
long
shadows
and
the
three
pakistani
engineers
paused
still
gripping
their
uzis
to
gaze
up
and
admire
them
do
stand
there
gawking
peretz
curtly
brought
them
to
attention
we
got
to
get
moving
if
anybody
has
started
any
satellite
recon
of
this
place
we
could
be
on
tv
by
now
a
can
read
the
address
on
a
fucking
postcard
he
signaled
for
the
pilot
to
release
the
rear
entry
ramp
let
get
going
we
taking
them
in
immediately
the
pakistanis
saluted
in
paramilitary
style
secured
their
uzis
into
their
black
and
moved
expectantly
to
the
rear
of
the
helo
as
the
ramp
slowly
came
down
there
strapped
and
waiting
in
the
aft
bay
were
two
wooden
crates
cushioned
in
a
bed
of
clear
plastic
each
approximately
a
meter
square
and
weighing
just
under
a
hundred
kilos
phase
four
had
begun
chapter
six
cally
andros
felt
disgusted
physically
nauseated
and
partly
it
was
with
herself
blame
the
victim
she
wondered
if
all
hostages
felt
this
way
powerless
angry
and
scared
what
would
she
feel
next
she
had
heard
that
strange
things
happened
to
your
mind
when
you
lost
all
control
you
started
forgetting
recent
events
and
remembering
oddities
from
long
ago
childhood
memories
you
totally
repressed
stashed
away
somewhere
down
in
the
lower
cortex
it
had
already
started
dwelling
on
her
father
death
and
blaming
herself
when
the
real
reason
was
his
overwork
and
grief
and
other
memories
were
creeping
in
little
things
that
only
the
child
inside
would
regard
as
anything
but
trivial
that
first
bumbling
sexual
disaster
in
the
cal
tech
dorm
that
weekend
when
she
got
drunk
then
threw
up
on
his
pillow
she
repressed
that
one
completely
never
told
anybody
about
that
hoping
the
memory
would
just
go
away
god
it
was
horrible
and
now
it
was
back
right
at
the
top
of
the
remembrance
file
more
memories
the
first
year
at
bronx
science
when
her
very
first
real
date
stood
her
up
and
she
ended
up
sitting
home
all
night
crying
and
praying
everybody
was
going
to
believe
her
when
she
told
them
had
the
cramps
and
could
go
out
after
all
they
did
everybody
found
out
exactly
what
had
happened
humiliations
stupid
things
that
meant
so
much
at
the
time
that
they
stuck
you
felt
your
life
had
been
a
string
of
mistakes
and
you
wanted
to
go
back
and
get
it
right
before
you
checked
out
and
try
as
you
might
you
did
care
at
all
about
the
triumphs
degrees
ceremonies
honors
no
all
you
could
remember
were
the
little
trivial
things
joys
and
sadnesses
that
were
yours
alone
remembrances
of
trivialities
past
that
what
being
a
hostage
was
all
about
on
the
other
hand
and
she
hated
herself
for
this
feeling
there
was
something
almost
erotic
about
men
with
so
much
sudden
power
evil
had
its
own
allure
just
as
surely
as
good
were
they
just
two
opposite
sides
of
the
same
emotion
was
satan
the
real
hero
of
paradise
lost
was
ramirez
that
same
figure
the
sexiness
of
power
bill
bates
had
the
same
aura
georges
and
his
young
staff
engineers
were
sitting
listlessly
and
staring
at
their
computer
screens
looking
exhausted
and
defeated
bill
had
been
confined
to
his
office
where
he
could
do
nothing
but
fume
since
his
radio
had
been
shut
down
and
there
was
now
only
one
phone
remaining
connected
to
the
outside
world
the
one
on
her
desk
which
they
monitored
it
got
worse
isaac
was
coming
in
which
meant
they
have
a
real
prize
for
a
hostage
as
if
bill
were
enough
to
have
a
famous
american
jewish
professor
in
hand
would
be
the
topping
on
their
whole
grab
she
tried
to
catch
georges
eye
across
the
room
he
seemed
to
be
drowsing
at
his
terminal
almost
as
though
nothing
had
happened
since
he
had
always
held
a
political
stance
slightly
to
the
left
of
che
guevara
maybe
he
secretly
enjoyed
being
taken
hostage
by
these
appointed
enemies
of
american
capitalism
no
she
saw
an
eyelid
flutter
he
was
just
faking
his
calm
he
was
scared
to
death
and
he
was
thinking
about
what
she
had
done
some
thinking
of
her
own
about
the
guy
who
called
himself
number
one
the
terrorist
now
sitting
at
the
other
end
of
command
calmly
smoking
a
thin
cigar
as
she
examined
him
the
gray
temples
and
perfect
tan
the
beige
sunglasses
she
began
to
find
his
appearance
a
little
incongruous
what
was
it
well
for
one
thing
he
looked
too
perfect
something
about
him
he
had
to
be
at
least
in
his
late
forties
but
nobody
face
looked
like
that
at
his
age
it
was
too
smooth
too
tight
plastic
surgery
the
bastard
had
changed
his
appearance
so
who
was
he
really
he
had
given
his
name
but
his
face
must
have
mattered
once
who
try
and
put
it
together
she
told
herself
he
not
middle
eastern
maybe
he
trying
to
pass
as
an
arab
but
he
not
fooling
me
no
latin
it
in
the
way
he
moves
the
way
he
brushes
at
his
sleeve
the
way
he
holds
his
cigar
he
just
like
domingo
the
guy
in
junior
year
who
thought
he
was
god
gift
to
the
feminine
gender
yes
domingo
was
a
latin
caricature
but
this
guy
has
all
the
same
moves
they
ca
escape
it
they
just
so
proud
of
being
male
the
ironic
part
was
half
the
time
domingo
could
get
it
up
unless
some
act
of
violence
was
involved
he
liked
to
dominate
or
be
dominated
power
was
what
he
was
all
about
power
think
can
you
use
that
some
way
to
get
to
this
guy
no
she
told
herself
this
killer
has
all
the
power
he
needs
about
image
and
money
she
moved
through
the
rows
of
workstations
now
merely
flashing
updates
of
the
status
of
the
various
components
of
the
cyclops
system
the
power
plant
was
idling
now
the
superconducting
coil
in
standby
mode
the
crew
of
technicians
armed
with
a
punch
list
of
items
was
checking
out
the
cyclops
itself
the
test
had
been
a
total
success
miss
andros
you
are
a
beautiful
woman
ramirez
glanced
up
as
she
approached
he
had
seemed
to
be
meditating
on
his
cigar
inspecting
the
ash
as
he
slowly
allowed
it
to
accumulate
i
was
wondering
why
a
creature
of
such
beauty
would
want
to
submit
herself
to
this
kind
of
manly
trade
not
as
a
trade
as
yours
killing
for
profit
she
felt
her
anger
coming
back
and
her
courage
as
far
as
i
concerned
no
difference
between
a
and
a
common
murderer
you
disgust
me
his
face
flushed
for
a
millisecond
as
he
impassively
drew
on
his
cigar
it
would
be
better
if
you
would
consider
me
and
the
rest
of
these
men
as
economic
freedom
fighters
perhaps
i
a
robin
hood
right
she
felt
like
spitting
on
him
a
definitely
unladylike
response
you
steal
from
the
rich
and
give
to
yourself
but
made
a
big
mistake
this
time
all
you
going
to
do
is
ruin
satcom
ruin
you
he
seemed
amused
at
the
notion
taking
another
puff
on
his
cigar
i
have
no
desire
to
ruin
your
precious
american
corporation
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
going
to
make
you
the
beneficiary
of
a
billion
dollars
worth
of
free
publicity
truly
no
money
in
the
world
could
purchase
what
i
am
about
to
do
for
you
and
all
i
want
in
return
is
to
borrow
your
cyclops
laser
for
a
few
days
if
anything
you
should
pay
me
though
there
will
be
others
to
do
that
i
do
know
who
you
expect
to
come
up
with
any
money
it
sure
as
hell
is
going
to
be
satcom
we
totally
tapped
out
if
this
launch
does
meet
our
schedule
day
after
tomorrow
a
bunch
of
banks
in
geneva
and
tokyo
are
going
to
take
us
over
and
i
doubt
very
much
they
going
to
pay
off
you
and
your
goons
they
tell
you
to
go
screw
yourself
they
can
do
whatever
they
wish
they
not
the
ones
who
going
to
pay
there
was
no
trace
of
sarcasm
in
his
voice
we
are
going
to
make
the
americans
pay
for
their
crimes
against
the
muslim
peoples
of
the
world
a
lot
of
crap
she
hated
the
man
really
hated
him
you
care
a
damn
about
the
peoples
do
you
senor
he
pulled
up
sharply
and
stared
at
her
startled
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
barged
in
he
seemed
momentarily
at
a
loss
for
words
but
he
covered
it
quickly
by
reaching
out
to
tap
his
cigar
ash
into
a
filled
trash
can
what
are
you
suggesting
you
a
fake
through
and
through
keep
him
on
the
defensive
she
thought
as
phony
as
they
come
who
are
you
really
his
composure
was
returning
an
instinct
for
chivalry
that
could
operate
on
autopilot
if
need
be
i
flattered
by
your
interest
in
me
but
who
i
am
need
not
concern
you
all
you
need
to
worry
about
is
following
my
instructions
then
you
and
i
will
get
along
nicely
listen
you
creep
there
no
way
we
are
going
to
get
along
nicely
or
otherwise
she
felt
her
resolve
growing
you
do
know
me
i
going
to
fight
you
with
everything
i
have
you
going
to
have
to
kill
me
to
stop
me
do
yourself
a
favor
miss
andros
he
pulled
again
on
his
cigar
inhaling
the
harsh
smoke
do
make
that
necessary
isaac
mannheim
gazed
down
through
the
glass
partition
of
the
old
bell
jetranger
and
wondered
again
what
he
was
seeing
the
pilot
raise
command
on
the
radio
and
now
he
was
grumbling
that
the
pad
looked
unsafe
the
boy
had
a
point
the
surrounding
hurricane
fence
had
been
half
ripped
away
and
there
was
oil
everywhere
on
the
asphalt
the
place
looked
as
though
a
raging
bull
elephant
had
powered
its
way
through
knocking
aside
everything
in
its
wake
what
in
blazes
had
happened
a
tornado
he
surveyed
the
area
and
something
even
more
ominous
caught
his
eye
what
was
it
that
thing
in
the
trees
about
the
way
up
the
mountain
now
he
strained
to
see
through
the
smudgy
windows
just
making
out
the
wreckage
of
some
sort
of
military
helicopter
next
he
turned
and
looked
in
the
other
direction
down
toward
the
launch
vehicles
that
odd
another
helicopter
was
parked
down
there
it
was
big
a
military
gray
but
no
one
was
around
it
it
looks
like
there
was
a
crash
on
the
pad
or
something
the
young
greek
pilot
shouted
over
the
roar
of
the
engines
his
dark
serious
eyes
fixed
gravely
on
the
scene
his
name
sewn
in
greek
on
his
tan
shirt
was
mikis
his
father
owned
the
jetranger
and
the
business
flying
this
far
from
athens
meant
he
would
have
to
refuel
to
make
it
back
and
nobody
was
around
to
take
care
of
that
moreover
the
situation
definitely
looked
unsafe
i
can
see
that
mannheim
responded
dryly
his
voice
faint
above
the
noise
which
is
why
you
need
to
be
careful
we
do
want
to
add
another
casualty
something
funny
is
definitely
going
on
mikis
continued
to
no
one
in
particular
he
had
already
discovered
the
eccentric
american
professor
with
a
baseball
cap
did
care
all
that
much
for
small
talk
and
he
had
no
patience
whatsoever
for
small
talk
that
pointed
out
the
obvious
i
do
like
this
but
i
have
to
put
her
down
i
already
on
my
auxiliary
tank
for
once
mannheim
allowed
his
thoughts
to
stray
to
the
concerns
of
someone
else
there
an
airfield
at
kythera
you
could
make
it
there
if
you
just
touched
down
here
and
dropped
me
off
are
you
sure
you
want
to
do
that
mikis
was
gripping
the
stick
frowning
behind
his
aviator
shades
we
ca
raise
anybody
here
on
the
radio
and
now
there
this
mess
let
me
take
you
to
kythera
with
me
the
whole
deal
looks
weird
no
mannheim
shouted
back
i
have
to
find
out
what
happened
this
project
is
like
sarah
he
thought
his
estranged
daughter
coming
to
mind
i
had
to
do
everything
i
knew
how
to
try
to
keep
her
from
making
the
wrong
decisions
then
he
remembered
ruefully
that
she
had
gone
ahead
and
made
them
anyway
but
he
had
been
there
always
ready
to
give
her
advice
mikis
shrugged
clearly
worried
and
gave
the
jetranger
some
pedal
circling
to
search
for
signs
of
life
there
was
nothing
the
bleak
granite
cliffs
were
barren
and
the
cool
blue
of
the
light
surf
washed
against
an
empty
shoreline
he
had
not
seen
this
space
facility
before
but
everybody
had
heard
about
it
the
most
impressive
sight
was
of
course
those
silver
spires
down
at
the
other
end
of
the
island
those
had
to
be
their
vehicles
but
nobody
was
around
them
now
puzzled
he
examined
the
huge
residence
in
the
middle
of
the
island
and
the
supply
buildings
lined
along
a
paved
segment
connecting
the
landing
pad
with
the
main
building
and
still
saw
no
one
look
i
going
to
just
drop
you
off
and
then
get
the
hell
out
of
here
he
yelled
over
he
was
easing
up
on
the
collective
taking
her
in
i
buy
petrol
on
kythera
i
do
see
anybody
around
and
this
place
gives
me
the
creeps
you
done
all
you
need
to
mannheim
shouted
back
something
his
voice
trailed
off
as
he
finally
saw
some
movement
a
figure
was
coming
down
the
mountain
carrying
what
looked
like
an
automatic
weapon
we
better
make
this
quick
vance
was
moving
as
fast
as
he
could
and
watching
as
the
helicopter
now
about
a
thousand
yards
from
the
pad
began
its
final
approach
friend
or
foe
with
the
second
arrival
in
as
many
hours
the
place
resembled
an
airport
he
assumed
by
now
they
surely
had
seen
the
wreckage
of
the
hind
but
they
seemed
determined
to
come
in
anyway
he
watched
as
the
old
bell
gingerly
began
to
hover
above
the
landing
pad
the
pilot
dispensing
with
preliminaries
while
it
was
settling
in
he
chambered
a
round
in
the
uzi
pulled
back
the
gnarled
cocking
lever
on
the
top
and
continued
on
down
the
hill
at
a
brisk
pace
with
any
luck
he
would
beat
the
guys
in
black
or
maybe
they
were
deliberately
keeping
a
low
profile
hoping
to
lure
in
the
prey
they
were
also
luring
him
out
he
knew
but
he
had
to
take
the
chance
he
was
moving
quickly
the
sharp
rocks
cutting
into
his
feet
and
now
only
a
hundred
yards
or
so
remained
between
him
and
the
approaching
helo
only
then
did
he
first
notice
he
had
bumped
bill
new
agusta
when
he
tried
to
fly
the
hind
leaving
a
bad
dent
now
he
owed
bates
for
repairs
great
he
wondered
fleetingly
if
satcom
had
terrorist
insurance
there
was
now
an
opening
in
the
pad
protective
fence
where
the
hind
had
ripped
it
away
and
as
the
din
of
the
approaching
helicopter
rang
in
his
ears
he
raced
across
the
last
clearing
headed
for
it
but
his
instincts
caused
him
to
look
around
and
just
in
time
approaching
on
the
run
down
the
asphalt
road
leading
from
the
launch
facility
were
three
of
the
terrorists
he
recognized
two
of
them
as
his
earlier
assailants
together
with
a
third
who
looked
like
he
might
actually
know
what
he
was
doing
they
must
have
seen
the
arriving
jetranger
and
now
they
were
coming
out
to
give
it
a
welcome
the
way
they
were
moving
and
the
they
were
carrying
told
him
a
lot
the
chopper
occupants
were
the
good
guys
as
the
bell
settled
in
and
its
door
opened
he
dropped
onto
the
granite
and
nestled
the
metal
stock
of
the
uzi
against
his
cheek
it
felt
warm
from
the
morning
sun
like
the
touch
of
a
comfortable
friend
he
flipped
the
fire
control
to
semiautomatic
and
caught
the
approaching
goons
in
the
metal
sight
then
he
gently
squeezed
the
trigger
the
uzi
kicked
back
sending
a
round
upward
into
the
morning
air
he
realized
he
was
out
of
practice
next
time
he
would
handle
it
better
but
for
now
he
had
blown
the
operation
the
three
in
black
who
had
been
running
toward
the
landing
pad
dropped
onto
the
asphalt
and
opened
fire
spattering
flecks
of
granite
around
him
as
he
took
cover
then
he
looked
up
to
see
an
elderly
man
fairly
tumble
out
of
the
chopper
and
make
a
dash
for
the
safety
of
the
satcom
agusta
he
need
not
have
hurried
no
one
was
shooting
at
him
as
the
jetranger
started
to
lift
off
however
the
gunmen
focus
switched
away
from
vance
and
he
realized
they
had
no
intention
of
letting
it
escape
as
it
left
the
pad
and
banked
to
gain
altitude
the
lead
terrorist
dropped
to
a
prone
position
on
the
asphalt
and
took
aim
directly
at
the
cockpit
where
the
pilot
was
just
visible
behind
the
glare
of
the
windscreen
with
a
range
of
only
fifty
yards
vance
realized
taking
him
out
would
be
easy
it
was
the
was
on
full
auto
and
one
burst
splintered
away
the
windscreen
exploding
it
and
leaving
what
remained
spattered
with
blood
the
pilot
was
thrown
against
the
shattered
glass
then
left
hanging
halfway
through
he
never
knew
what
hit
him
the
fuselage
began
to
pirouette
into
a
sickening
spiral
but
the
firing
continued
as
though
to
kill
what
was
already
dead
the
obsessed
vance
thought
he
also
emptying
his
magazine
now
the
time
make
a
move
while
he
still
distracted
these
thugs
want
the
old
man
alive
whoever
he
is
so
why
not
try
and
ruin
their
day
get
him
before
they
do
the
bell
continued
to
autorotate
in
a
series
of
circles
then
it
abruptly
nosed
straight
downward
and
a
second
later
it
veered
toward
the
side
of
the
cliff
abutting
the
sea
a
splintering
crash
replaced
the
sound
of
the
engine
as
the
rotors
slammed
against
the
granite
shearing
away
whereupon
the
fuselage
bounced
down
the
steep
wall
of
the
cliff
and
into
the
water
in
moments
the
seabed
swallowed
it
up
in
the
meantime
vance
had
reached
the
landing
pad
a
few
meters
away
from
the
old
man
who
was
stumbling
distractedly
across
the
asphalt
staring
in
the
direction
the
chopper
had
disappeared
and
so
shocked
by
the
sight
he
seemed
not
to
realize
he
was
walking
directly
into
the
hands
of
the
men
who
had
killed
the
pilot
vance
wanted
to
shout
but
then
he
thought
better
of
it
what
was
the
point
the
old
man
clearly
was
unable
to
think
he
had
to
be
pulled
out
quickly
and
with
a
minimum
of
risk
no
the
best
thing
to
do
was
lay
down
a
line
of
covering
fire
and
go
for
him
he
opened
up
the
uzi
on
semiauto
and
dashed
for
the
agusta
wolf
helling
hit
the
ground
rolling
bringing
up
his
kalashnikov
set
on
automatic
the
renegade
guard
was
back
to
shoot
it
out
firing
from
somewhere
in
the
area
of
the
pad
good
he
was
going
to
trap
the
fucker
this
time
he
would
handle
the
situation
personally
he
would
not
have
to
depend
on
a
bunch
of
incompetent
east
german
stasi
burnouts
he
glanced
back
and
saw
the
two
trailing
behind
him
when
the
guard
had
opened
fire
they
dived
and
stumbled
for
the
cover
of
the
storage
sheds
they
would
be
any
help
but
he
known
that
already
it
did
matter
this
was
going
to
be
and
easy
the
chopper
had
been
lost
which
was
a
shame
although
ramirez
orders
were
to
seize
it
when
it
arrived
that
had
not
been
possible
you
win
some
you
lose
some
amid
the
gunfire
the
old
man
had
reached
the
satcom
helicopter
while
the
guard
was
now
making
a
dash
for
its
protection
too
even
as
he
covered
himself
with
another
spray
from
the
automatic
that
the
damn
fools
had
let
him
get
fortunately
his
aim
was
wild
again
probably
because
he
was
running
and
the
rounds
sailed
by
harmlessly
and
he
was
in
the
open
now
helling
trained
his
long
barrel
and
heavy
clip
on
him
and
pulled
the
trigger
his
clip
was
empty
he
cursed
himself
for
having
used
the
gun
on
automatic
at
ten
pops
a
second
you
could
wipe
out
a
round
clip
before
you
could
sneeze
still
cursing
he
pushed
the
button
releasing
the
clip
and
slammed
in
another
but
he
was
too
late
by
that
time
the
guard
had
disappeared
behind
the
satcom
helicopter
the
two
east
germans
were
firing
randomly
and
ineffectually
from
the
safety
of
the
storage
sheds
holding
their
weapons
around
the
corners
and
spraying
blindly
idiots
they
were
providing
cover
but
since
they
had
no
idea
where
they
were
aiming
they
were
endangering
him
at
least
as
much
as
their
target
and
now
the
bastard
had
reached
the
cover
of
the
helicopter
he
was
safe
for
the
moment
but
only
for
the
moment
do
shoot
isaac
mannheim
shouted
as
he
saw
the
unshaven
barefoot
man
roll
next
to
him
an
uzi
giving
off
bursts
of
rounds
get
down
vance
yelled
back
then
shoved
him
onto
the
asphalt
beside
the
agusta
you
picked
a
hell
of
a
time
to
come
visiting
there
some
new
natives
and
they
not
overly
friendly
who
are
you
the
old
man
ancient
eyes
were
brimming
with
alarm
and
confusion
what
are
you
doing
here
at
the
moment
i
trying
to
keep
you
alive
vance
checked
the
clip
of
the
uzi
there
were
about
seven
rounds
left
with
three
hoods
out
there
all
with
kalashnikovs
seven
rounds
would
not
go
very
far
was
anything
usable
in
the
agusta
he
asked
himself
he
peered
through
the
glass
of
the
cockpit
searching
it
looked
empty
except
for
a
blast
of
fire
careened
by
the
canopy
and
he
again
yanked
mannheim
down
onto
the
asphalt
then
he
cautiously
raised
up
enough
to
recon
the
situation
the
hoods
were
all
advancing
now
scurrying
forward
from
building
to
building
as
they
gave
covering
blasts
from
their
automatics
however
the
two
farthest
back
did
not
seem
to
be
overly
enthusiastic
they
going
to
kill
us
too
mannheim
stammered
can
you
just
stay
down
vance
interrupted
him
i
probably
the
one
they
want
to
get
rid
of
if
they
wanted
you
dead
believe
me
you
would
be
by
now
he
opened
the
door
and
hurriedly
surveyed
the
cockpit
more
closely
yes
he
had
seen
it
right
attached
to
the
back
firewall
ready
for
emergency
use
was
a
rack
of
smoke
grenades
factory
fresh
the
kind
used
for
signaling
in
case
the
helo
went
down
he
remembered
that
grenade
smoke
was
designed
to
cling
to
the
ground
rather
than
rise
and
with
a
burn
time
between
one
and
two
minutes
a
good
grenade
could
produce
a
quarter
million
cubic
feet
of
hc
smoke
maybe
he
thought
i
just
got
lucky
he
peeled
one
off
the
rack
and
checked
it
over
yep
american
which
everybody
knew
was
the
best
the
can
was
about
the
size
of
a
diet
coke
and
it
was
military
gray
it
even
gave
the
flavor
on
the
side
this
one
was
red
but
they
also
came
in
yellow
and
white
nice
to
have
around
if
you
went
down
in
wooded
terrain
he
looked
toward
the
gunmen
approaching
and
made
the
decision
on
the
spot
with
a
quick
motion
he
clenched
the
handle
with
his
right
hand
and
yanked
the
steel
pin
with
his
left
when
he
looked
up
again
they
had
closed
the
distance
now
only
about
thirty
yards
time
for
a
touchdown
he
drew
back
and
lobbed
the
can
directly
at
the
lead
terrorist
the
time
delay
was
one
and
a
half
seconds
it
landed
just
in
front
of
the
first
man
bounced
once
and
blew
an
eruption
of
red
that
engulfed
him
beautiful
with
a
quick
twist
he
yanked
the
rack
from
the
side
of
the
cockpit
and
began
hurling
the
cans
as
fast
as
he
could
finally
he
grabbed
the
startled
old
professor
by
the
arm
then
dropped
the
last
grenade
at
their
feet
time
to
move
the
party
there
cover
in
the
rocks
up
there
mannheim
stumbled
backward
as
the
smoke
bomb
exploded
and
vance
realized
he
would
never
make
it
he
would
have
to
be
dragged
or
carried
and
since
dragging
was
out
of
the
question
there
really
was
only
one
option
he
bent
down
and
grabbed
the
old
man
around
the
waist
then
lifted
him
over
his
shoulder
it
turned
out
he
was
hardly
more
than
skin
and
bones
maybe
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
tops
after
spending
the
last
four
days
heaving
the
tillers
of
the
late
lamented
the
load
seemed
like
a
feather
some
more
random
gunfire
exploded
behind
them
as
he
struggled
and
stumbled
up
the
rocky
slope
but
now
a
dense
cloud
of
red
completely
obliterated
the
scene
below
the
grenades
were
still
billowing
totally
obscuring
the
landing
pad
and
the
roadway
when
they
reached
the
first
clump
of
brush
leading
up
the
mountain
he
settled
mannheim
onto
the
ground
the
old
professor
was
choking
from
the
smoke
totally
disoriented
and
babbling
vance
clapped
a
hand
over
his
mouth
then
urged
him
onward
no
talking
if
they
find
us
we
going
to
have
some
really
lousy
odds
he
removed
his
hand
and
immediately
mannheim
started
again
whoever
you
are
i
guess
i
have
to
thank
you
for
saving
my
life
he
puffed
over
the
stones
who
are
you
i
a
friend
of
bill
bates
the
man
supposedly
in
charge
around
here
i
isaac
mannheim
this
project
the
godfather
vance
looked
him
over
bill
talked
about
you
mit
right
the
cyclops
is
my
nice
to
meet
you
now
who
in
the
hell
are
these
thugs
i
have
no
idea
well
we
can
assume
they
not
part
of
bill
technical
support
team
he
glanced
down
the
hill
toward
the
drifting
cloud
of
red
smoke
then
back
at
the
old
man
but
if
you
been
involved
in
this
project
then
you
must
know
the
layout
here
i
know
it
very
well
but
good
we
going
to
have
to
keep
moving
at
least
till
it
gets
dark
but
while
we
doing
that
i
want
you
to
get
me
up
to
speed
on
where
things
are
give
me
the
setup
and
tell
me
how
many
personnel
are
here
and
where
they
are
mannheim
pointed
down
the
hill
at
a
point
just
past
the
storage
sheds
the
people
are
housed
in
the
bates
motel
which
is
over
there
beyond
that
row
of
buildings
vance
looked
it
over
at
the
moment
it
seemed
deserted
where
the
entrance
you
can
go
in
directly
from
the
connecting
corridor
underground
or
you
can
use
the
front
entrance
there
what
if
the
entrance
topside
were
locked
then
it
would
he
secure
right
i
suppose
so
he
still
seemed
disoriented
though
he
was
recovering
of
course
there
are
fire
exits
at
various
places
in
the
underground
network
as
well
as
the
security
lobby
over
there
and
then
the
storage
sheds
can
be
accessed
from
below
but
all
of
those
can
be
sealed
right
yes
in
fact
they
can
be
sealed
electronically
from
command
the
staff
controls
everything
from
there
vance
looked
down
at
the
white
surf
rippled
across
the
blue
so
if
somebody
wanted
to
take
over
this
place
that
where
they
would
start
right
hit
that
and
you
in
like
a
bandit
it
the
head
office
that
correct
mannheim
nodded
good
we
know
where
to
focus
now
you
going
to
tell
me
how
i
can
get
there
chapter
seven
pierre
armont
was
with
gray
temples
and
a
body
appropriate
to
an
olympic
wrestler
he
had
full
cheeks
a
heavy
mustache
and
suspicious
dark
eyes
that
constantly
searched
his
surroundings
it
was
an
innate
survival
instinct
he
never
went
out
without
a
tie
and
a
perfect
shoeshine
not
to
mention
a
crisp
military
bearing
that
sat
as
comfortably
on
him
as
a
birthright
he
prided
himself
on
his
ability
to
instill
discipline
while
at
the
same
time
leading
his
men
although
he
liked
to
command
he
wanted
to
do
it
from
the
front
where
the
action
was
here
in
paris
he
ran
a
worldwide
business
from
a
gray
stone
townhouse
situated
on
the
left
bank
in
an
obscure
at
the
intersection
of
des
arts
and
rue
de
comedie
fifty
meters
away
from
his
doorway
the
rue
de
seine
wound
down
to
the
river
playing
host
to
one
of
paris
finer
produce
markets
while
farther
down
rows
of
small
galleries
displayed
the
latest
in
painting
and
sculpture
an
avid
amateur
chef
and
art
collector
he
found
the
location
ideal
from
his
house
where
the
french
aviator
once
wrote
he
could
march
a
few
paces
along
cobblestones
as
old
as
chartres
and
acquire
a
freshly
plucked
pheasant
a
plump
grouse
aromatic
black
truffles
just
hours
away
from
the
countryside
or
an
abstract
landscape
whose
paint
was
scarcely
dry
it
was
the
best
of
all
worlds
everything
he
loved
was
just
meters
away
and
yet
his
secretive
courtyard
provided
perfect
urban
privacy
and
security
with
only
the
occasional
student
from
the
academie
de
wandering
into
his
courtyard
to
sketch
he
was
rich
and
he
knew
how
to
live
well
he
also
risked
his
life
on
a
regular
basis
he
claimed
it
made
his
gras
even
better
he
worked
behind
a
wide
oak
desk
flanked
by
a
line
of
communications
equipment
and
along
one
wall
stood
rows
of
files
secured
inside
safes
his
wide
oak
desk
could
have
belonged
in
the
office
of
a
travel
agent
with
a
very
select
clientele
however
it
served
another
purpose
entirely
it
was
where
he
planned
operations
for
arm
pierre
armont
headed
up
the
association
of
retired
mercenaries
and
he
had
been
busy
all
day
but
he
was
used
to
emergencies
what
other
people
called
problems
arm
thought
of
as
business
the
association
of
retired
mercenaries
was
a
secretive
but
loose
group
of
former
members
of
various
antiterrorist
organizations
the
name
was
an
inside
joke
because
they
were
far
from
retired
although
they
were
not
listed
in
the
paris
phone
book
governments
who
needed
their
services
somehow
always
knew
how
to
find
pierre
arm
took
on
nasty
counterterrorism
actions
that
could
not
occur
officially
they
rescued
hostages
unreported
in
newspapers
and
they
had
terminated
more
than
a
few
unpleasant
individuals
in
covert
actions
that
never
made
the
evening
news
at
the
moment
as
he
was
thinking
over
the
insertion
strategy
for
andikythera
he
was
gazing
down
on
his
private
courtyard
and
noticing
that
the
honking
from
the
boulevard
indicated
that
paris
traffic
had
ground
to
a
halt
again
he
had
just
hung
up
the
scrambled
phone
after
a
conversation
with
reggie
hall
the
second
today
london
was
on
board
so
everything
was
a
go
he
was
looking
forward
to
this
one
some
had
mucked
with
an
arm
job
they
had
to
be
taken
down
armont
was

from

as

for
his
present
occupation
over
the
years
gigene
had
carried
out
among
other
things
vip
protection
in
situations
and
general
antiterrorist
ops
mostly
commandos
in
their
twenties
and
early
thirties
gigene
operatives
had
to
pass
a
grueling
series
of
tests
including
firing
an
h

while
swinging
through
a
window
in
a
quick
entry
called
the
pendulum
technique
known
for
their
skills
in
inserting
by
helicopter
either
by
rappelling
or
by
parachuting
they
could
also
swim
half
a
mile
under
water
and
come
out
blasting
using
their
specially
loaded
norma
ammo
armont
particular
claim
to
fame
was
the
invention
of
a
sophisticated
slingshot
that
fired
deadly
steel
balls
for
a
silent
kill
he
had
trained
antiterrorist
units
in
a
number
of
france
former
colonies
and
had
secretly
provided
tactical
guidance
for
the
saudi
national
guard
when
they
ejected
radical
muslims
from
the
great
mosque
at
mecca
these
days
however
he
was
a
private
citizen
and
ran
a
simple
business
and
as
with
all
businesses
the
customer
was
king
if
problems
arose
they
had
to
be
resolved
if
a
job
did
not
stick
you
sent
in
a
repair
team
an
american
member
of
arm
named
michael
vance
who
normally
did
not
participate
in
the
operations
end
of
the
business
had
turned
up
at
the
wrong
place
at
the
right
time
a
reuters
confirmation
of
the
loss
of
the
communications
ship
definitely
meant
some
bad
action
had
gone
down
in
the
eastern
med
analysis
that
it
was
a
preliminary
to
seizure
of
the
satcom
facility
on
andikythera
probably
was
correct
armont
secretary
had
spent
the
day
on
the
phone
trying
to
reach
the
island
but
all
commercial
communications
with
the
site
were
down
there
was
no
way
that
should
have
happened
even
with
last
night
rough
storm
he
had
liked
michael
vance
the
minute
he
met
him
three
years
earlier
he
considered
mike
reliable
in
completing
his
assignments
be
they
quick
access
to
a
secure
bank
computer
file
or
a
paper
trail
of
wire
transfers
stretching
from
miami
to
nassau
to
geneva
to
bogota
regular
missions
for
arm
however
were
those
kinds
of
transactions
not
the
street
action
and
armont
could
only
hope
he
could
also
manage
the
rougher
end
of
the
business
the
organization
had
checked
out
the
man
extensively
as
they
did
all
new
members
and
arm
computer
probably
knew
as
much
about
him
as
he
did
himself
it
was
an
oddball
story
son
of
a
famous
penn
archaeologist
he
had
been
by
turns
an
archaeologist
himself
a
yachtsman
and
a
spook
after
he
finished
his
doctorate
at
yale
and
had
taught
there
for
two
semesters
he
had
published
his
dissertation
claiming
the
famous
palace
of
minos
in
crete
was
actually
a
hallowed
necropolis
as
a
book
it
had
caused
a
lot
of
flap
and
to
get
away
for
a
while
he
had
taken
a
vacation
in
nassau
to
do
some
game
fishing
before
the
trip
ended
he
had
bought
an
old
foot
bristol
sailboat
in
need
of
massive
restoration
it
was
a
classic
wooden
vessel
which
meant
that
no
sooner
had
he
finished
varnishing
the
thing
from
one
end
to
the
other
than
he
had
to
start
over
again
but
he
apparently
liked
the
life
or
maybe
he
just
enjoyed
giving
the
academic
snakepit
a
rest
the
computer
could
not
get
into
his
mind
whatever
the
reason
however
the
sailboat
which
had
begun
as
a
diversion
soon
became
something
else
by
the
time
he
had
finished
refurbishing
her
she
was
the
most
beautiful
yacht
in
the
caribbean
and
everybody
around
nassau
wanted
a
shot
at
the
helm
he
had
a
charter
business
on
his
hands
then
his
saga
took
yet
another
turn
the
nassau
yacht
club
and
the
new
hurricane
hole
marina
across
the
bridge
on
paradise
island
comprised
a
yachting
fraternity
that
included
a
lot
of
bankers
nassau
after
all
had
over
three
hundred
foreign
commercial
banks
and
its
see
no
evil
approach
to
regulation
and
reporting
made
it
a
natural
haven
for
drug
receipts
with
a
lot
of
bankers
as
clients
before
long
vance
knew
more
than
any
man
should
about
offshore
money
laundering
he
did
not
like
that
part
of
the
scene
but
the
bankers
loved
his
yacht
and
they
paid
cash
as
he
once
told
it
he
eventually
found
out
why
at
least
for
one
of
them
one
sunny
afternoon
the
vice
president
of
the
european
consolidated
commercial
bank
an
attractive
young
swiss
mover
known
to
vance
only
as
werner
was
docking
at
hurricane
hole
bringing
her
back
from
a
sail
when
the
dea
swooped
down
flanked
by
the
local
bahamian
police
armed
with
warrants
they
searched
the
boat
and
soon
uncovered
fifty
kilos
of
colombian
export
produce
seems
werner
had
sailed
ulysses
some
prearranged
point
and
taken
it
on
planning
to
have
divers
stash
the
packages
in
the
air
pocket
of
one
of
the
giant
cruise
ships
that
tied
up
at
nassau
dock
vance
heard
about
it
when
he
got
a
call
from
the
harbormaster
advising
him
that
his
prized
bristol
had
just
been
seized
as
evidence
in
a
coke
bust
he
was
out
of
business
that
afternoon
bill
bates
had
coincidentally
flown
in
on
merv
paradise
island
commuter
airline
and
come
over
to
hurricane
hole
wanting
to
charter
ulysses
a
week
of
sailing
and
fishing
vance
had
to
inform
him
his
favorite
bahamian
yacht
had
just
acquired
a
new
owner
bates
could
not
believe
he
had
flown
into
such
a
vance
was
having
his
own
problems
with
disbelief
too
but
paying
the
mortgage
was
his
more
immediate
concern
the
dea
had
the
boat
but
before
long
he
would
have
to
worry
about
that
any
more
that
problem
and
the
boat
would
soon
belong
to
the
bank
over
on
bay
street
he
immediately
slapped
the
dea
with
a
lawsuit
just
to
put
on
some
heat
his
lawyer
claimed
he
did
have
a
hope
in
hell
but
two
weeks
later
a
bahamian
judge
after
lunch
with
the
holding
banker
summarily
ordered
the
dea
to
release
the
yacht
to
vance
surprise
the
drug
enforcement
administration
cheerfully
complied
and
turned
it
over
the
same
afternoon
he
immediately
dropped
the
lawsuit
writing
off
the
whole
affair
as
a
triumph
for
truth
justice
and
the
bahamian
way
of
banking
or
so
it
seemed
only
later
did
he
unearth
the
byzantine
complexities
of
what
really
had
happened
the
affair
had
somehow
come
to
the
attention
of
the
company
and
there
had
been
a
flurry
of
phone
calls
to
the
dea
in
new
orleans
from
langley
virginia
a
month
later
while
he
was
in
the
states
attending
a
yale
alumni
function
he
found
himself
talking
to
two
earnest
washington
bureaucrats
who
congratulated
him
on
beating
the
system
huh
they
then
described
their
need
for
a
financial
consultant
in
nassau
somebody
who
knew
the
right
people
maybe
he
would
consider
taking
the
job
it
could
merely
be
a
favor
for
they
hinted
broadly
a
favor
here
was
the
problem
the
cia
desperately
needed
help
in
trying
to
keep
track
of
the
cocaine
millions
being
laundered
through
nassau
banks
the
company
wanted
some
local
assistance
getting
certain
audits
from
clean
bankers
who
were
tired
of
nassau
being
a
haven
for
dirty
cash
he
hated
drugs
and
drug
money
so
he
had
seen
nothing
wrong
with
the
idea
he
even
ended
up
training
some
greenhorns
out
of
langley
in
the
subtle
art
of
tracing
wire
transfers
two
years
later
he
got
his
payoff
they
formed
their
own
desk
to
do
what
he
had
been
doing
and
retired
him
he
was
it
turned
out
too
successful
but
the
word
on
such
skills
got
around
and
two
months
later
pierre
armont
had
approached
him
about
joining
arm
they
needed
somebody
good
at
tracing
hot
money
frequently
the
most
reliable
trail
of
a
terrorist
operation
and
everybody
close
to
the
business
had
identified
him
as
the
best
around
by
that
time
he
had
formally
incorporated
a
charter
operation
in
nassau
as
windstalker
with
three
boats
three
mortgages
and
a
big
monthly
nut
so
he
had
signed
on
only
later
discovering
that
along
with
arm
extra
cash
came
a
lot
of
travel
many
responsibilities
and
occasional
death
threats
he
took
them
seriously
enough
to
start
carrying
his
own
protection
a
walther
armont
approved
vance
had
always
been
well
paid
it
was
expected
anybody
who
hired
arm
usually
because
there
was
nowhere
else
left
to
turn
knew
the
best
did
not
come
cheap
a
good
op
could
pull
down
fifty
thousand
pounds
sterling
for
every
man
on
the
team
which
was
why
the
boys
drove
bmws
and
drank
scotch
but
no
client
ever
complained
about
the
price
or
if
they
did
they
did
complain
to
pierre
payment
was
always
cash
half
up
front
and
the
rest
on
delivery
any
client
who
welshed
on
the
would
be
making
a
very
considered
career
decision
he
pulled
the
blinds
and
turned
to
his
desk
faxes
sent
via
secure
encrypted
system
covered
the
surface
the
team
was
coming
together
his
secretary
emile
a
young
frenchman
who
came
in
mornings
and
worked
in
the
next
room
had
already
booked
the
necessary
flights
by
hours
tomorrow
everybody
would
be
assembled
in
athens
and
ready
to
insert
armont
intended
to
lead
the
operation
himself
unless
vance
as
the
man
on
the
ground
proved
the
logical
choice
since
he
was
already
in
place
always
the
best
location
he
would
in
any
case
have
to
be
point
man
he
had
talked
the
job
over
with
hans
in
frankfurt
at
hours
just
after
he
had
gotten
the
call
from
athens
and
together
they
had
picked
six
operatives
vance
would
make
seven
he
calculated
that
would
be
plenty
hans
was
the
de
guerre
a
former
germany
grenzschutzgruppen
headquartered
at
augustin
just
outside
bonn
had
a
underground
training
range
that
included
a
communications
and
intel
unit
aircraft
mockups
an
engineer
unit
a
weapons
unit
an
equipment
unit
a
training
unit
and
a
strike
unit
in
his
fifteen
years
with
hans
had
been
known
to
achieve
percent
accuracy
with
an
h
k
when
firing
from
a
moving
vehicle
or
even
rappelling
down
a
rope
from
a
hovering
chopper
now
retired
he
brought
to
arm
many
talents
as
well
as
participating
in
the
op
he
usually
acted
as
liaison
officer
because
of
his
flawless
english
he
also
knew
which
from
that
was
anybody
over
five
were
looking
for
an
op
and
if
the
job
required
some
younger
talent
he
used
his
connections
to
get
current
members
temporarily
released
from
their
units
when
needed
he
could
arrange
for
weapons
otherwise
unavailable
or
restricted
once
when
a
situation
called
for
a
hot
new
ir
scope
he
borrowed
one
from
the
augustin
armory
overnight
made
a
drawing
then
had
it
copied
in
brussels
by
noon
the
next
day
he
knew
where
to
find
arm
field
operatives
and
what
shape
they
were
in
which
ones
had
been
shot
up
broken
legs
in
parachute
drops
or
gone
over
the
edge
with
a
case
of
nerves
and
too
much
booze
best
of
all
though
he
could
usually
locate
a
wanted
terrorist
was
hooked
directly
into
a
massive
computer
in
wiesbaden
informally
known
as
the
kommissar
hans
could
still
tap
into
the
kommissar
which
tracked
various
world
terrorist
groups
constantly
updating
everything
known
about
their
methods
their
membership
and
most
importantly
their
movements
these
days
he
operated
a
rundown
in
frankfurt
at
least
as
his
cover
and
there
were
suspicions
he
managed
to
drink
up
a
lot
of
its
profits
in
any
case
he
was
in
arm
for
the
money
and
he
never
pretended
otherwise
so
when
armont
rang
him
he
was
immediately
all
ears
never
failed
pierre
comment
allez
vous
at
in
the
morning
hans
could
be
cheerful
armont
definitely
a
night
person
never
understood
how
he
did
it
considering
armont
knew
hans
was
more
comfortable
in
english
than
in
french
and
he
hated
speaking
german
what
you
doing
for
the
next
couple
of
days
got
something
the
german
interest
immediately
perked
up
there
a
little
cleanup
after
he
gave
him
a
quick
briefing
on
the
situation
via
their
secure
phone
hans
was
extremely
unhappy
dimitri
screwed
up
it
not
our
problem
i
say
it
our
problem
pierre
replied
we
guarantee
our
work
and
you
either
in
or
you
out
permanently
those
are
the
rules
all
right
hans
sighed
ca
blame
me
for
not
liking
it
though
so
who
do
you
think
we
need
armont
asked
hans
knew
the
people
better
than
he
did
well
we
definitely
should
have
reggie
he
replied
straightaway
he
the
best
negotiator
we
got
and
also
he
can
get
us
some
of
the
hardware
we
be
needing
the
man
in
question
was
reginald
hall
just
under
fifty
he
was
a
stocky
instructor
regimental
sergeant
major
retired
of
the
sas
britain
special
air
service
in
the
old
days
he
headed
up
a
unit
known
in
the
press
as
the
crw
counter
revolutionary
warfare
section
called
the
special
projects
blokes
by
those
on
the
inside
he
finally
quit
after
successfully
leading
an
assault
on
the
iranian
embassy
in
london
on
may
which
to
his
astonished
dismay
was
televised
live
he
gotten
famous
overnight
and
after
thinking
it
over
for
a
weekend
he
decided
the
time
had
come
to
cash
it
in
these
days
he
ran
a
small
company
that
purportedly
bought
and
sold
used
sports
firearms
that
was
a
polite
way
of
saying
he
dabbled
in
the
international
arms
trade
though
not
in
a
big
way
but
whenever
abm
needed
a
special
piece
of
equipment
as
often
as
not
reggie
found
a
way
to
take
care
of
it
he
did
not
do
it
for
love
even
though
he
was
happily
retired
down
in
dorset
thomas
hardy
country
with
a
plump
welsh
wife
he
occasionally
slipped
away
much
to
her
chagrin
to
take
on
special
ops
for
arm
maybe
his
neighbors
thought
he
had
bought
their
matching
jaguars
with
his
army
pension
or
the
sale
of
used
mausers
i
call
him
as
soon
as
we
hang
up
he
spent
some
time
in
the
emirates
or
some
damn
place
and
claims
to
speak
a
little
arabic
he
was
thinking
okay
who
else
could
we
use
how
about
the
flying
dutchmen
hans
said
he
was
referring
to
the
voorst
brothers
willem
and
hugo
both
former
members
of
the
royal
dutch
marines
whiskey
company
that
was
the
nickname
of
a
special
group
officially
known
as
the
marine
close
combat
unit
both
bachelors
though
never
short
of
women
they
lived
in
amsterdam
and
took
on
any
security
job
that
looked
like
it
would
pay
they
also
ran
a
aircraft
charter
operation
we
might
need
a
chopper
for
the
insert
think
they
can
handle
it
on
such
short
notice
the
voorst
brothers
would
occasionally
arrange
through
their
old
connections
for
a
dutch
military
helicopter
to
get
lost
in
paperwork
for
a
weekend
whiskey
company
was
a
club
and
everybody
was
going
to
retire
someday
what
went
around
came
around
besides
there
was
plenty
of
spare
change
in
it
for
those
who
made
the
arrangements
with
nobody
paying
it
take
some
fast
talking
so
far
this
thing
being
done
on
spec
we
just
making
good
on
a
job
do
remind
me
hans
groaned
do
want
to
hear
it
i
think
better
just
rent
something
in
athens
he
paused
but
i
also
think
we
ought
to
take
along
the
hunter
he
be
the
man
to
handle
grenades
he
loves
those
damned
things
better
than
his
wife
they
were
both
thinking
of
marcel
formerly
of
the
belgian
esi
escadron
special
while
with
esi
he
had
fathered
their
famous
units
pairs
of
teams
and
had
come
up
with
the
idea
of
carrying
a
spare
magazine
on
the
wrist
to
facilitate
rapid
mag
change
esi
was
known
informally
as
diana
unit
and
since
diana
was
the
huntress
of
mythology
marcel
had
become
known
as
the
hunter
but
not
till
after
he
had
earned
the
sobriquet
a
former
belgian
paratrooper
he
got
the
nickname
after
a
special
op
there
when
he
had
saved
an
entire
arm
team
by
taking
out
a
room
of
terrorists
with
three
stun
grenades
tear
gas
and
an
uzi
while
wearing
an
antiflash
hood
called
a
balaclava
plus
a
gas
mask
a
little
like
working
under
water
marcel
liked
the
nickname
i
see
if
i
can
reach
him
the
antwerp
number
well
we
probably
need
him
hans
paused
and
vance
is
already
on
site
that
make
all
the
difference
he
good
if
you
can
get
all
the
others
i
think
we
have
what
we
need
let
get
started
i
try
to
reach
everybody
and
have
them
in
athens
by
late
tomorrow
fax
me
an
equipment
list
and
i
talk
that
over
with
spiros
see
what
he
can
get
together
for
us
down
there
and
save
having
to
ship
it
you
know
hans
had
said
this
is
no
way
to
start
a
day
it
was
there
for
the
national
security
agency
the
nsa
admitted
theodore
brock
his
special
assistant
for
national
security
affairs
the
atmosphere
in
the
oval
office
was
heating
up
i
now
well
aware
of
that
the
president
snapped
not
bothering
to
hide
his
annoyance
what
i
not
well
aware
of
is
who
the
hell
authorized
it
the
oval
office
in
the
southeast
corner
of
the
white
house
west
wing
was
in
the
eyes
of
many
a
small
unimposing
prize
for
all
the
effort
required
to
take
up
residence
john
hansen
however
seemed
not
to
notice
he
commandeered
whatever
space
he
happened
to
occupy
and
made
it
seem
an
extension
of
his
own
spirit
in
fact
he
rather
liked
the
minimalist
quarters
heritage
of
a
time
when
presidents
had
much
less
weight
on
their
shoulders
from
here
the
wide
world
opened
out
for
one
thing
the
communications
here
and
in
the
situation
boom
in
the
basement
put
the
planet
at
his
fingertips
next
to
a
gigantic
button
multiline
telephone
was
another
highly
secure
and
modernistic
digital
voice
transmission
system
that
could
take
him
anywhere
as
the
danish
grandfather
clock
his
only
personal
item
in
the
office
began
to
chime
the
half
hour
he
glanced
once
more
over
the
crisis
summary
that
alicia
winston
had
hastily
assembled
and
had
waiting
on
his
desk
when
he
returned
from
new
york
her
office
was
conveniently
just
behind
one
of
the
three
doors
that
led
into
the
oval
office
another
led
to
his
personal
study
passing
through
a
small
kitchen
from
which
now
came
the
aroma
of
jamaican
blue
mountain
coffee
the
third
opened
onto
a
corridor
with
the
standard
six
secret
service
people
through
which
he
expected
to
see
his
national
security
adviser
appear
at
then
according
to
his
schedule
he
had
to
try
to
put
all
this
out
of
his
mind
at
when
he
was
due
to
host
a
delegation
of
troglodytes
from
the
hill
nuclear
disarmament
did
not
have
a
lot
of
friends
in
tennessee
and
washington
state
he
was
going
to
have
to
make
some
concessions
he
knew
but
politics
was
about
compromise
always
had
been
apparently
the
ship
was
put
into
place
without
authorization
brock
went
on
there
was
some
request
from
nsa
they
wanted
to
keep
tabs
on
a
space
project
on
an
island
in
the
aegean
satcom
now
we
spying
on
americans
is
that
it
hansen
leaned
back
in
his
high
chair
and
tossed
a
telling
glance
toward
morton
davies
his
chief
of
staff
who
monitored
most
of
his
incoming
calls
they
both
had
received
an
earful
on
the
cyclops
project
from
his
old
professor
isaac
mannheim
who
claimed
it
would
demonstrate
to
the
world
that
america
private
sector
still
had
plenty
of
life
left
could
stand
up
to
the
europeans
and
the
japanese
when
it
came
to
innovation
satcom
independence
from
government
at
least
to
mannheim
way
of
thinking
was
precisely
its
greatest
virtue
well
damn
nsa
he
continued
this
is
an
outrage
he
recalled
that
he
sent
the
new
director
al
giramonti
a
pointedly
worded
memo
on
that
very
subject
when
john
hansen
took
office
the
national
security
agency
was
still
liberally
exercising
its
capacity
to
monitor
every
phone
call
in
america
from
its
vast
array
of
listening
antennas
at
fort
meade
he
had
resolved
to
terminate
the
practice
he
thought
he
had
it
was
just
routine
surveillance
brock
insisted
squirming
he
was
in
his
late
fifties
bright
with
glasses
and
a
high
forehead
he
also
was
black
and
he
felt
he
had
more
than
the
usual
obligation
to
make
his
president
look
good
there
was
a
satellite
test
launching
in
the
works
the
whole
project
has
been
kept
under
wraps
and
nasa
wanted
to
know
what
was
going
on
the
national
security
agency
had
a
platform
in
the
area
so
it
all
more
or
less
meshed
there
was
nothing
and
what
do
the
israelis
have
to
say
for
themselves
the
president
pushed
on
the
hind
had
their
markings
they
deny
they
had
anything
to
do
with
it
he
squinted
toward
hansen
trying
to
seem
knowledgeable
yet
uncommitted
which
way
was
the
wind
going
to
blow
next
even
though
the
helo
was
plainly
id
by
that
what
they
claimed
in
hansen
fumed
cutting
him
off
when
they
strafed
torpedoed
and
napalmed
nsa
liberty
which
was
clearly
in
international
waters
they
were
hoping
to
prolong
the
war
long
enough
to
roll
into
syria
and
they
did
want
us
to
monitor
their
plans
so
they
took
careful
pains
to
knock
out
all
our
sigint
capability
in
the
region
just
happening
to
kill
a
dozen
seamen
in
the
process
afterwards
the
lying
fuckers
told
our
embassy
in
tel
aviv
it
was
all
a
mistake
and
sent
flowers
if
anybody
else
in
the
world
had
done
that
we
have
nuked
them
well
at
the
time
the
glover
was
hit
it
was
monitoring
israeli
sigint
brock
noted
adjusting
his
glasses
we
think
they
clean
on
this
one
at
least
what
we
have
from
fort
meade
so
far
seems
to
bear
that
out
they
still
running
a
computer
analysis
though
pulling
out
all
the
voice
and
code
used
by
the
israeli
air
force
during
that
time
we
did
have
that
capability
back
in
in
a
few
more
hours
we
be
able
to
put
that
question
to
rest
one
way
or
another
okay
maybe
we
should
go
slow
till
then
so
in
the
meantime
take
them
at
their
word
for
a
moment
and
examine
the
other
possibilities
hansen
revolved
in
his
chair
and
stared
out
the
bulletproof
window
behind
him
the
washington
sky
was
growing
overcast
and
the
clock
was
running
this
whole
would
be
in
washington
post
garbled
just
as
sure
as
the
sun
was
going
to
come
up
cnn
had
already
picked
up
the
bbc
rumor
and
was
running
it
on
their
headline
service
hinting
the
intelligence
community
had
been
caught
with
its
pants
around
its
ankles
again
there
more
brock
said
interrupting
his
thoughts
the
iranians
have
been
screaming
about
a
stolen
hind
for
four
days
blaming
us
of
course
but
they
quietly
let
mossad
know
they
think
it
may
have
strayed
into
pakistan
maybe
as
a
diversion
and
then
ended
up
heading
out
for
one
of
the
gulf
states
probably
yemen
the
israelis
have
reason
to
believe
it
was
delivered
to
a
freighter
in
the
persian
gulf
then
taken
through
the
suez
canal
and
into
the
eastern
med
after
that
all
contact
was
lost
iran
the
president
thought
pakistan
none
of
it
sorted
into
a
picture
unless
incidentally
morton
davies
chief
of
staff
interjected
the
israelis
also
have
one
other
bit
of
intel
that
seems
to
have
somehow
gotten
lost
in
all
of
nsa
cray
supercomputers
an
israeli
trawler
picked
up
a
mayday
they
triangulated
as
coming
from
somewhere
north
of
crete
it
supposedly
claimed
the
transmission
was
a
bit
garbled
to
emanate
from
the
very
hind
that
had
attacked
the
ship
the
broadcast
said
that
terrorists
had
taken
over
the
satcom
facility
on
the
island
of
andikythera
if
that
true
it
would
be
the
one
that
the
glover
was
monitoring
hansen
stared
at
him
are
we
supposed
to
believe
any
of
this
that
unknown
terrorists
are
behind
this
whole
thing
that
exactly
the
kind
of
disinformation
the
israelis
have
used
on
us
in
the
past
besides
it
does
click
if
terrorists
did
do
it
they
damned
sure
want
the
credit
nobody
throws
a
rock
this
size
through
your
window
unless
there
a
note
attached
so
where
is
it
that
when
the
import
of
what
davies
had
said
hit
him
satcom
it
was
going
to
be
the
pride
of
america
a
symbol
my
god
it
was
a
rocket
launch
facility
he
reached
down
and
touched
the
blue
button
on
the
desk
intercom
on
the
right
side
of
his
desk
alicia
sir
came
back
the
crisp
reply
have
nsa
send
over
any
recent
photoint
they
have
on
the
greek
island
of
andikythera
by
hand
i
want
it
yesterday
yes
sir
ted
he
said
turning
back
to
brock
somehow
this
time
i
got
an
uncomfortable
feeling
the
medium
may
be
the
message
to
understand
the
operation
of
this
facility
isaac
mannheim
was
saying
you
need
to
appreciate
the
technology
we
installed
here
he
was
resting
against
the
trunk
of
a
tree
gazing
wearily
down
the
mountain
at
the
asphalt
of
the
facility
stretching
below
i
already
got
a
rough
idea
how
it
works
vance
replied
he
was
pondering
the
quiet
down
below
it
the
people
i
want
to
know
more
about
well
of
course
that
my
primary
concern
as
well
the
old
man
shrugged
but
we
are
on
the
verge
of
an
experiment
that
will
change
the
world
for
all
time
that
just
as
important
not
in
my
book
perhaps
but
all
the
same
i
think
i
should
tell
you
a
few
technical
details
about
the
facility
since
you
say
you
familiar
with
its
general
workings
you
probably
know
that
its
heart
is
a
laser
we
call
the
cyclops
using
it
we
can
send
a
beam
hundreds
of
miles
into
space
without
losing
appreciable
energy
our
plan
is
to
use
that
beam
of
energy
which
we
can
direct
very
accurately
to
power
a
satellite
launch
vehicle
i
understand
that
excellent
he
said
as
though
encouraging
a
student
then
he
pushed
on
in
any
case
the
cyclops
itself
is
a
electron
laser
which
means
the
computer
can
tune
it
continuously
to
the
most
wavelength
a
crucial
feature
it
starts
with
an
intense
beam
of
electrons
which
it
accelerates
to
high
velocity
then
passes
through
an
array
of
magnets
we
call
the
those
magnets
are
arranged
in
a
line
but
they
alternate
in
polarity
which
causes
the
electrons
passing
through
to
experience
rapid
variations
in
strength
and
direction
what
happens
is
the
alternating
magnetic
field
the
beam
of
electrons
into
a
wave
causing
them
to
emit
a
microwave
pulse
which
is
itself
then
passed
back
and
forth
gaining
strength
at
every
pass
eventually
it
saturates
at
a
level
nearly
equal
to
the
power
of
grand
coulee
dam
and
then
maybe
you
ought
to
get
to
the
point
vance
said
feeling
he
was
receiving
a
college
lecture
he
used
to
give
college
lectures
for
chrissake
in
archaeology
were
they
just
as
tedious
he
suddenly
wondered
of
course
he
pushed
on
oblivious
whole
operation
is
controlled
by
our
fujitsu
supercomputer
the
hardest
part
is
getting
the
microwave
pulses
and
the
electron
pulses
to
overlap
perfectly
in
the
wiggler
that
part
of
the
cyclops
called
the
coaxial
phase
shifter
requires
delicate
the
alignment
has
to
be
critically
adjusted
the
focusing
perfect
the
cavity
length
get
back
to
the
vehicle
i
think
i
heard
all
i
need
to
know
about
the
wonders
of
the
cyclops
very
well
the
energy
is
focused
in
bursts
from
up
there
he
turned
and
pointed
up
the
mountain
that
installation
is
a
microwave
transmission
system
which
delivers
it
to
the
spacecraft
to
a
port
located
on
the
sides
of
the
vehicles
down
there
the
port
is
a
special
crystal
of
synthetic
diamond
once
inside
the
beam
is
directed
downward
into
the
nozzle
where
it
strikes
dry
ice
and
creates
plasma
producing
thrust
the
vehicle
is
orbit
nothing
is
burned
vance
had
to
admit
it
was
a
nifty
idea
if
you
could
do
it
that
correct
the
laser
beam
creates
a
shock
wave
a
burst
of
superheated
gas
moving
at
supersonic
velocity
out
of
the
nozzle
by
pulsing
the
beam
we
form
a
detonation
wave
that
hits
the
nozzle
chamber
and
so
it
really
star
wars
in
reverse
vance
interjected
bates
is
using
all
that
fancy
research
in
lasers
to
put
up
a
satellite
instead
of
shooting
one
down
the
power
is
comparable
the
superconducting
coil
we
use
to
store
power
can
pulse
as
high
as
billion
watts
the
dry
ice
that
is
the
is
only
about
three
hundred
kilograms
a
tiny
percentage
of
the
vehicle
weight
and
since
the
vehicle
is
virtually
all
payload
we
should
be
able
to
put
it
into
a
orbit
in
a
matter
of
minutes
the
beam
energy
will
be
roughly
five
hundred
gigawatts
per
second
and
i
get
the
picture
vance
interjected
tired
of
numbers
but
what
you
really
saying
is
that
this
transmission
system
up
here
on
the
mountain
is
the
key
to
everything
if
it
goes
down
end
of
show
he
was
thinking
the
terrorists
had
not
destroyed
anything
at
least
not
up
here
which
probably
meant
they
intended
to
use
it
the
prospect
chilled
him
okay
let
work
backward
to
where
the
people
are
he
continued
what
down
below
us
here
the
power
has
to
get
up
here
somehow
we
at
one
end
of
the
island
down
a
bit
from
command
which
is
underground
that
where
the
computer
is
which
handles
the
output
frequencies
of
the
cyclops
and
also
the
trajectory
analysis
it
gets
data
from
a
radar
up
here
on
the
mountain
and
uses
that
to
provide
guidance
for
the
laser
beam
as
the
vehicle
gains
altitude
there
are
giant
that
keep
the
parabolic
antennas
trained
on
the
vehicle
as
it
lifts
off
the
pad
and
heads
into
orbit
they
also
retrieve
all
the
telemetry
from
the
spacecraft
and
what
belowground
down
there
he
was
pointing
toward
the
vehicles
that
area
has
an
excavated
space
below
it
for
the
cavity
amplifier
bay
it
the
what
that
where
the
laser
the
cyclops
begins
pumping
up
then
the
energy
is
sent
up
here
he
pointed
back
up
the
mountain
to
the
transmission
system
right
so
underground
it
shaped
something
like
a
dumbbell
with
the
technical
management
staff
at
this
end
and
then
the
operating
people
down
there
what
in
between
just
a
big
connecting
tunnel
correct
and
of
course
the
communications
conduits
for
all
the
wiring
okay
vance
thought
now
we
getting
somewhere
the
terrorists
will
be
split
up
that
going
to
make
things
easier
and
harder
they
could
be
taken
out
one
group
at
a
time
but
there
also
could
be
hostages
at
peril
all
over
the
place
these
situations
are
always
a
lot
cleaner
when
all
the
hostages
are
in
one
location
any
other
connections
well
there
really
only
one
he
shrugged
and
ran
his
hand
through
his
mane
of
white
hair
vance
thought
it
made
him
look
like
an
aging
lion
as
you
can
imagine
these
levels
of
power
mean
there
are
enormous
quantities
of
waste
heat
so
bates
tunneled
water
conduits
between
a
submerged
pumping
station
on
the
other
side
of
the
island
and
a
number
of
locations
vance
pulse
quickened
what
do
they
lead
to
they
run
from
the
computer
in
command
and
the
power
plant
down
at
the
other
end
of
the
island
right
beneath
where
we
are
now
and
actually
one
leads
up
to
those
heat
exchangers
there
he
was
pointing
up
the
mountain
past
a
large
cinderblock
building
at
the
edge
of
the
radar
installation
a
tunnel
filled
with
water
vance
thought
there
been
enough
swimming
for
a
while
but
if
the
system
is
off
then
then
there
must
be
an
up
there
somewhere
he
smiled
and
nodded
wistfully
i
assume
there
must
be
but
i
know
where
it
is
think
it
big
enough
for
somebody
to
get
into
it
should
be
everything
was
since
we
were
sure
how
much
waste
heat
there
would
be
so
all
i
have
to
do
is
get
into
the
heat
exchanger
then
hope
some
air
left
in
bill
granite
water
pipe
the
old
man
looked
worried
do
you
realize
the
kind
of
energy
that
goes
through
that
conduit
if
they
should
turn
on
the
pumps
you
be
drowned
in
an
instant
and
then
dumped
out
to
sea
i
already
been
drowned
once
on
this
trip
another
time
matter
he
shrugged
but
i
got
to
get
inside
and
find
out
how
many
terrorists
there
are
and
where
they
keeping
the
people
once
i
figure
out
their
deployment
he
was
thinking
we
can
plan
the
assault
it
dangerous
mannheim
mumbled
that
conduit
was
never
intended
to
have
anybody
i
forewarned
he
was
apprehensively
rising
to
his
feet
and
wincing
at
his
aches
all
you
have
to
do
is
get
me
inside
georges
lefarge
felt
like
he
was
getting
a
fever
or
maybe
the
room
was
just
growing
hot
all
he
knew
was
he
was
miserable
he
swabbed
at
his
face
with
a
moist
paper
towel
and
tried
to
breathe
normally
telling
himself
he
had
to
keep
going
had
to
stick
by
cally
this
was
no
time
to
give
in
to
these
creeps
and
get
sick
ardent
and
intense
georges
looked
every
inch
the
computer
hacker
he
was
but
he
also
was
one
of
the
finest
aerospace
engineers
ever
to
come
out
of
cal
tech
although
his
long
hair
and
beard
were
intended
to
deliver
a
fierce
political
statement
his
benign
blue
eyes
negated
the
message
he
was
an
idealist
but
one
filled
with
love
not
hate
his
politics
were
as
simplistic
as
his
technical
skills
were
he
never
managed
to
understand
why
everyone
in
the
world
did
not
act
rationally
he
had
grown
up
in
new
york
soho
district
living
in
a
mammoth
sparsely
furnished
loft
with
his
mother
a
widely
praised
painter
of
massive
abstract
oils
usually
in
black
and
ocher
her
depressing
paintings
were
huge
but
her
income
only
occasionally
was
and
georges
memory
of
his
childhood
was
years
of
alternating
caviar
and
spaghetti
his
french
canadian
father
had
long
since
returned
to
a
cabin
in
northern
quebec
never
to
be
heard
from
again
he
also
remembered
his
mother
string
of
lovers
an
emotional
intrusion
he
never
quite
came
to
accept
the
day
he
went
off
to
mit
on
a
national
merit
scholarship
was
the
happiest
of
his
life
or
at
least
he
had
thought
so
until
he
got
a
call
from
cally
andros
asking
him
to
come
to
work
for
satcom
he
was
now
single
and
he
loved
girls
or
the
idea
of
girls
no
the
truth
was
that
he
loved
one
girl
and
had
forever
she
was
now
his
boss
after
years
of
separation
they
had
finally
dabbled
at
an
affair
here
on
andikythera
but
he
had
to
admit
it
had
worked
at
first
it
had
seemed
a
good
idea
his
boyhood
dream
come
true
but
now
he
had
realized
maybe
they
were
better
off
just
being
friends
she
became
a
different
person
in
bed
and
one
he
found
slightly
terrifying
but
given
what
had
just
happened
all
that
seemed
part
of
another
forgotten
place
and
time
in
addition
to
having
a
fever
he
was
and
his
neck
ached
but
he
wanted
desperately
to
stay
alert
he
stroked
the
wispy
beard
he
had
been
trying
to
grow
for
the
last
four
months
gazed
at
the
terminal
and
warned
himself
to
stop
thinking
like
an
engineer
and
try
to
think
like
a
terrorist
these
european
criminals
had
shown
up
just
in
time
for
the
first
space
shot
which
meant
they
had
something
planned
that
needed
a
vehicle
they
were
going
to
hold
the
facility
for
ransom
there
was
nothing
here
they
could
steal
also
they
had
been
very
careful
not
to
damage
any
of
the
systems
which
meant
their
real
program
whatever
it
was
needed
the
cyclops
to
work
and
a
vehicle
to
lift
off
if
that
did
happen
they
were
screwed
so
he
thought
you
sabotage
thursday
shot
and
you
nix
their
plot
whatever
it
is
but
cally
would
have
a
fit
bates
needed
a
success
and
soon
or
the
whole
satcom
gamble
would
go
down
the
tubes
it
was
a
scenario
what
to
do
simple
just
keep
working
for
now
and
hope
what
else
was
there
on
the
screen
in
front
of
him
now
was
the
output
of
a
program
in
progress
this
one
called
which
was
a
daily
of
the
coils
of
the
radar
system
on
the
mountain
the
computer
methodically
checked
all
the
power
systems
for
any
hint
of
malfunction
and
the
program
had
to
be
run
rain
or
shine
it
was
now
time
to
kick
on
the
pumps
and
heat
exchangers
and
get
going
something
to
do
the
cursor
was
flashing
ready
for
the
power
on
command
he
hit
the
enter
key
activating
the
pumps
for
the
heat
exchangers
then
turned
to
see
cally
approaching
winding
her
way
through
the
workstations
led
by
the
head
terrorist
the
fucker
who
called
himself
number
one
lefarge
could
not
get
over
the
fact
the
bastard
looked
like
an
executive
from
the
arlington
office
only
better
dressed
georges
you
got
to
kill
cally
said
although
she
looked
normal
there
was
extreme
anxiety
in
her
voice
the
strain
was
coming
through
we
have
to
do
a
different
run
she
was
passing
her
fingers
nervously
through
her
hair
he
loved
her
dark
mediterranean
tresses
a
trajectory
analysis
using
sort
the
fujitsu
supercomputer
they
were
using
was
programmed
with
a
special
nasa
program
developed
by
astronautics
called
sort
an
abbreviation
for
simulation
and
optimization
of
rocket
trajectories
it
minimized
the
laser
energy
required
for
an
insertion
trajectory
into
low
earth
orbit
it
also
calculated
the
nozzle
vectors
to
adjust
altitude
while
the
vehicle
was
in
flight
midcourse
corrections
all
you
had
to
do
was
program
everything
in
now
but
i
just
started
here
a
list
of
what
he
wants
she
glanced
at
number
one
again
then
handed
over
a
sheet
of
blue
paper
he
took
it
and
looked
down
maybe
they
were
about
to
tip
their
hand
but
what
could
they
know
about
computers
he
finally
focused
on
the
sheet
what
these
were
satellite
trajectories
these
were
longitude
and
latitude
coordinates
then
he
studied
it
more
carefully
they
were
abort
targets
chapter
eight
the
conduit
was
roughly
a
meter
and
a
half
in
diameter
and
pitch
dark
he
had
expected
that
and
had
extracted
a
waterproof
flashlight
from
an
emergency
kit
in
the
wreckage
of
the
hind
it
was
helping
but
not
all
that
much
with
the
heat
exchangers
off
no
water
was
flowing
the
stone
walls
were
merely
moist
the
curved
sides
covered
with
slime
the
tunnel
sloped
downward
from
the
installation
on
the
mountain
as
a
gentle
incline
and
although
the
gray
algae
that
swathed
its
sides
now
covered
him
he
had
found
niches
in
the
granite
to
hang
onto
as
he
worked
his
way
down
then
it
had
leveled
out
matching
the
terrain
and
that
was
when
he
encountered
the
first
water
now
up
around
his
waist
the
radars
up
the
hill
he
realized
were
only
one
of
the
producers
of
waste
heat
ahead
the
tunnel
he
was
in
seemed
to
join
a
larger
one
from
another
site
as
part
of
a
general
confluence
thank
god
all
the
systems
are
in
standby
he
thought
if
those
massive
pumps
down
by
the
shore
start
up
they
produce
a
raging
torrent
that
leave
no
place
to
hide
as
he
splashed
through
the
dark
he
found
himself
pondering
if
this
was
what
he
had
been
placed
on
the
planet
to
do
maybe
he
should
never
have
left
yale
the
pay
was
decent
the
hours
leisurely
the
company
congenial
poking
around
in
the
hidden
secrets
of
the
past
always
gave
solace
to
the
spirit
what
did
humanity
think
about
three
thousand
years
ago
five
thousand
five
hundred
what
were
their
loves
their
hates
their
fears
their
dreams
were
they
the
same
as
ours
and
why
did
humanity
always
need
to
worship
something
where
did
the
drive
come
from
to
create
poetry
music
painting
these
were
all
marvelous
mysteries
that
we
might
never
unravel
but
they
were
among
the
most
noble
questions
anyone
could
ask
what
makes
us
human
it
was
the
immortal
quandary
but
when
you
asked
that
you
also
had
to
ask
the
question
how
could
humanity
create
so
much
that
was
bad
at
the
same
time
so
much
tyranny
greed
hurt
how
did
all
that
beauty
and
ugliness
get
mixed
up
together
down
in
our
genes
maybe
he
was
about
to
find
out
more
about
the
evil
in
the
heart
of
man
coming
up
he
splashed
and
paddled
his
way
onward
his
flashlight
sending
a
puny
beam
ahead
and
tried
to
relate
his
location
to
the
rest
of
the
facility
before
entering
through
the
heat
exchanger
atop
the
mountain
he
had
grilled
mannheim
on
the
specifics
of
site
layout
the
old
man
however
had
really
known
much
about
the
nuts
and
bolts
of
the
facility
his
head
was
out
in
space
somewhere
all
the
same
vance
found
himself
liking
him
in
spite
of
his
encroaching
senility
even
homer
was
said
to
nod
just
hope
you
live
long
enough
to
get
senile
yourself
back
to
business
ahead
settled
into
the
top
of
the
conduit
was
a
metal
door
just
large
enough
for
a
man
to
work
through
what
was
that
for
he
wondered
maintenance
access
if
so
it
must
lead
into
the
main
facility
somewhere
he
felt
his
way
around
the
curved
sides
of
the
conduit
searching
for
flaws
in
the
granite
where
he
could
get
a
handhold
then
he
reached
up
and
tested
the
door
the
metal
was
beginning
to
rust
from
the
seawater
but
it
still
looked
workable
a
large
black
wheel
in
the
center
inset
with
gears
operated
sliding
bolts
that
fit
into
the
frame
this
has
to
be
fast
he
told
himself
do
a
quick
reconnoiter
of
the
place
and
make
mental
notes
look
for
and
escape
routes
then
get
back
in
time
for
the
radio
chat
with
pierre
about
three
hours
two
to
be
on
the
safe
side
he
braced
himself
against
the
stone
sides
of
the
conduit
and
holding
the
flashlight
with
one
hand
tried
to
budge
the
metal
wheel
nothing
the
contact
with
seawater
had
frozen
it
with
rust
he
tried
again
shoving
the
flashlight
into
his
belt
and
grappling
in
the
dark
twisting
the
wheel
with
both
hands
was
it
moving
he
felt
a
faint
vibration
make
its
way
down
the
stone
walls
of
the
conduit
then
there
was
a
hum
of
huge
electric
motors
starting
somewhere
somebody
was
turning
on
the
systems
he
listened
as
the
vibration
continued
to
grow
and
now
the
water
level
was
beginning
to
rise
as
the
pumps
down
by
the
shore
began
priming
were
they
about
to
turn
them
on
full
blast
the
involuntary
rush
of
his
pulse
and
his
breathing
made
him
abruptly
aware
of
how
close
the
confining
tunnel
felt
the
tight
hermetic
sense
of
claustrophobia
for
the
first
time
since
landing
on
andikythera
he
felt
real
fear
he
hated
the
dark
the
enclosed
space
and
now
he
was
trapped
idiot
how
did
you
get
yourself
into
this
you
going
to
be
drowned
in
about
thirty
seconds
now
the
roar
of
water
began
to
overwhelm
the
hum
of
the
pumps
the
conduit
was
filling
rapidly
and
flow
had
begun
he
realized
that
only
about
a
foot
of
airspace
remained
at
the
top
praying
for
a
miracle
he
heaved
against
the
metal
wheel
one
last
time
and
finally
felt
it
break
loose
begin
to
turn
abdoullah
had
finished
unpacking
the
second
crate
and
now
he
examined
what
he
had
two
nuclear
devices
made
using
enriched
from
the
kahuta
nuclear
research
center
he
smiled
again
to
think
they
had
been
smuggled
out
right
from
under
the
noses
of
the
officials
at
kahuta
directly
up
the
security
elevators
leading
down
to
the
centrifuge
at
level
five
the
research
center
was
situated
more
or
less
in
between
the
sister
cities
of
rawalpindi
and
islamabad
in
northeast
pakistan
where
it
was
surrounded
by
barren
rolling
hills
that
looked
toward
the
looming
border
of
afghanistan
kahuta
was
the
heart
of
program
and
its
many
levels
of
infrastructure
were
buried
deep
belowground
the
only
structure
visible
to
a
satellite
was
the
telltale
concrete
cupola
and
an
adjacent
plant
for
air
filtration
security
was
tight
with
high
fences
watchtowers
and
an
army
barracks
near
at
hand
the
security
was
for
a
reason
in
pakistan
began
acquiring
hardware
and
technology
for
a
plant
capable
of
producing
uranium
bombs
require
percent
enrichment
and
when
the
discovered
the
project
it
had
threatened
to
cut
off
aid
if
any
uranium
was
enriched
beyond
percent
pakistan
agreed
then
went
right
ahead
between
and
using
dummy
corporations
and
transshipments
through
third
countries
the
government
smuggled
from
west
germany
an
entire
plant
for
converting
uranium
powder
into
uranium
hexafluoride
a
compound
easily
gasified
and
then
enriched
two
years
later
the
nuclear
research
center
purchased
a
ton
of
specially
hardened
maraging
steel
from
west
germany
which
was
delivered
already
fabricated
into
round
bars
whose
diameter
exactly
matched
that
of
the
also
german
gas
centrifuges
under
construction
at
kahuta
shortly
thereafter
the
plant
at
dera
ghazi
khan
was
producing
uranium
hexafluoride
feedstock
for
the
kahuta
enrichment
facility
and
the
kahuta
facility
was
using
it
to
turn
out
enriched
uranium
in
abundance
at
the
same
time
pakistani
operatives
were
hastening
to
acquire
speed
american
electronic
switches
called
krytrons
the
triggering
devices
for
a
bomb
their
efforts
to
obtain
nuclear
detonators
required
several
tries
but
eventually
they
got
what
they
needed
they
dispensed
with
testing
of
the
nuclear
devices
they
had
assembled
having
procured
the
necessary
data
from
china
and
instead
just
went
ahead
and
made
their
bombs
they
then
secured
them
on
level
five
of
the
kahuta
reprocessing
facility
against
the
day
they
would
be
needed
until
now
liberating
two
of
those
had
required
a
lot
of
unofficial
cooperation
from
the
plant
security
forces
batteries
of
missiles
protected
kahuta
from
air
penetration
and
elite
paratroopers
and
army
tanks
reinforced
the
many
checkpoints
making
sure
that
no
vehicle
official
or
private
could
enter
or
leave
the
complex
without
a
stamped
authorization
by
the
security
chief
only
a
lot
of
money
in
the
right
hands
could
make
two
of
the
devices
disappear
sabri
ramirez
had
seen
to
that
small
technicality
abdoullah
patted
one
of
the
nuclear
weapons
casually
and
admired
it
the
bomb
itself
was
a
half
meter
in
diameter
its
outer
casing
of
octol
carefully
packed
inside
a
polished
steel
sheath
embedded
with
wires
expensive
but
available
commercially
octol
was
a
mixture
of
and
trinitrotoluene
known
colloquially
as
hmx
and
tnt
it
was
stable
powerful
and
the
triggering
agent
of
choice
for
nuclear
devices
inside
the
octol
encasing
each
device
were
kilograms
of
percent
enriched
when
the
external
octol
sphere
was
evenly
detonated
it
would
compress
the
uranium
core
sufficiently
to
create
a
critical
mass
causing
the
naturally
occurring
radioactive
decay
of
the
uranium
to
focus
in
upon
itself
once
the
radiation
intensified
it
started
an
avalanche
an
instantaneous
chain
reaction
of
that
converted
the
uranium
mass
into
enormous
quantities
of
energy
the
trick
to
making
it
work
was
an
even
synchronous
implosion
of
the
outer
sphere
which
was
the
job
of
the
krytron
detonator
switches
which
abdoullah
realized
were
still
in
the
sikorsky
the
krytrons
were
packed
separately
and
handled
as
though
they
were
finest
crystal
rais
he
said
looking
up
and
addressing
his
berkeley
classmate
now
standing
by
the
door
i
need
the
detonators
well
they
in
the
cockpit
where
we
stowed
them
he
was
tightening
his
commando
sweatband
itching
to
try
out
his
uzi
still
unfamiliar
would
the
others
notice
in
any
case
he
was
here
to
run
errands
then
go
get
them
for
chrissake
he
had
considered
rais
to
be
an
asshole
from
the
day
they
first
met
in
the
advanced
quantum
mechanics
class
at
college
nothing
that
had
happened
since
had
in
any
way
undermined
that
conviction
the
guy
thought
he
was
hot
stuff
gift
to
the
world
it
was
not
a
view
that
anybody
who
knew
him
shared
why
do
go
get
them
rais
said
not
moving
because
i
want
to
check
these
babies
over
and
make
sure
everything
is
a
go
what
a
jerk
come
on
man
do
start
giving
me
a
lot
of
shit
okay
this
is
serious
everybody
got
to
pull
his
weight
around
here
rais
hesitated
his
manhood
on
the
line
and
then
decided
to
capitulate
at
least
for
now
abdoullah
was
starting
to
throw
his
weight
around
get
on
the
nerves
the
guy
was
real
close
to
stepping
out
of
line
all
right
fuck
it
he
clicked
the
safety
on
his
uzi
on
and
off
and
on
then
holstered
it
as
long
as
you
at
it
why
do
you
just
take
them
directly
down
to
the
clean
room
we
be
assembling
everything
there
anyway
since
that
where
the
elevator
is
they
use
to
go
up
and
prep
the
vehicles
that
cool
see
you
down
there
rais
closed
the
door
and
walked
out
into
the
greek
sunshine
he
was
starting
to
like
this
fucking
place
vance
shoved
the
metal
door
open
just
as
the
roar
of
the
onrushing
water
reached
the
confluence
at
the
intersection
of
the
tunnel
a
mere
hundred
yards
ahead
the
tunnel
was
almost
full
now
the
water
flow
increasing
they
about
to
turn
on
the
cyclops
he
thought
you
got
about
fifteen
seconds
left
he
pulled
himself
through
the
metal
door
soaked
but
alive
and
rolled
onto
a
cement
floor
with
his
last
remaining
strength
he
reached
over
and
tipped
the
metal
door
shut
then
grabbed
the
wheel
and
gave
it
a
twist
down
below
he
could
feel
the
wall
of
water
surge
by
he
thought
he
was
going
to
faint
but
instead
he
took
a
deep
breath
and
pulled
out
the
flashlight
and
found
himself
in
a
communications
conduit
consisting
of
a
concrete
floor
with
styrofoam
insulation
overhead
all
around
him
stretched
what
seemed
miles
of
coaxial
cables
wrapped
in
huge
circular
strands
the
conduit
also
contained
bundles
for
carrying
computer
data
to
guide
the
parabolic
antennas
up
on
the
mountain
as
they
tracked
the
space
vehicle
the
major
contents
of
the
conduit
however
were
massive
copper
transmission
cables
what
had
mannheim
warned
how
many
gigawatts
per
second
the
numbers
were
too
to
comprehend
or
bother
remembering
all
they
meant
was
that
if
the
cyclops
were
suddenly
turned
on
the
gaussian
fields
of
electromagnetic
flux
would
probably
rearrange
his
brain
cells
permanently
he
rose
and
moved
down
the
conduit
feeling
along
its
curved
sides
his
back
braced
against
the
large
bundle
of
power
wires
in
the
center
while
ahead
of
him
the
darkness
gaped
a
few
yards
farther
though
and
the
probing
beam
of
his
flashlight
revealed
a
terminus
where
some
of
the
shielded
fiber
optics
had
been
shunted
off
into
the
wall
passing
through
a
heavy
metal
sleeve
although
it
was
welded
into
a
steel
plate
bolted
to
the
side
of
the
wall
large
handles
allowed
the
bolts
to
be
turned
without
the
aid
of
special
wrenches
whoever
designed
the
fiber
optics
for
this
tunnel
he
thought
did
want
a
lot
of
greek
workmen
down
here
waving
tools
around
after
a
long
lunch
of
guzzling
retsina
the
fibers
were
too
vulnerable
to
stand
up
to
any
banging
he
grasped
the
handles
and
began
to
twist
one
finding
the
bolts
well
lubricated
after
four
turns
it
opened
the
second
yielded
just
as
easily
then
the
third
and
the
fourth
he
took
a
deep
breath
thinking
this
might
be
his
first
encounter
with
the
hostages
and
the
terrorists
then
he
slid
the
metal
plate
back
away
from
the
wall
and
tried
to
peer
through
the
opening
was
approximately
a
meter
wide
with
the
bundle
of
cables
directly
through
the
middle
still
he
found
just
enough
clearance
to
slip
past
and
into
the
freezing
cold
of
the
room
used
to
prep
the
payloads
for
the
vehicles
what
this
all
about
lefarge
looked
again
at
the
sheet
then
up
at
number
one
sort
is
intended
to
calculate
orbital
parameters
optimize
them
and
if
there
is
an
abort
it
has
to
go
down
somewhere
you
talking
about
a
abort
lefarge
was
trying
to
sound
dumb
the
cyclops
ca
power
an
icbm
it
probably
could
but
he
did
want
to
mention
that
the
terrorist
who
called
himself
number
one
was
not
impressed
a
question
we
will
let
the
computer
decide
i
happen
to
believe
it
can
you
just
send
it
up
then
you
abort
when
you
fail
to
achieve
orbital
velocity
it
comes
down
the
nose
has
a
reentry
shield
since
you
are
planning
to
reuse
the
vehicle
it
should
work
very
nicely
georges
looked
at
cally
he
did
not
want
to
admit
it
but
this
guy
was
right
he
had
thought
about
that
a
lot
any
private
spaceport
could
be
seized
by
terrorists
and
turned
into
a
missile
launch
site
was
that
their
plan
i
wo
do
it
he
heard
himself
saying
i
refuse
that
is
a
mistake
number
one
replied
calmly
i
will
simply
shoot
one
of
your
technicians
here
every
five
minutes
until
you
begin
he
smiled
would
you
like
to
pick
the
first
preferably
someone
you
can
manage
without
you
bluffing
he
felt
a
chill
something
told
him
what
he
had
just
said
was
true
this
man
with
his
expensive
suit
and
haircut
meant
every
word
he
was
a
killer
georges
knew
he
had
never
met
anyone
remotely
like
him
young
man
you
are
an
amateur
his
eyes
had
grown
narrow
almost
disappearing
behind
his
gray
aviator
shades
amateurs
do
not
know
the
first
thing
about
bluffing
now
do
try
my
patience
he
turned
and
gestured
one
of
the
technicians
toward
them
he
was
a
young
man
in
his
he
came
forward
and
number
one
asked
his
name
i
chris
schneider
he
said
his
blond
hair
and
blue
eyes
attested
to
the
fact
his
father
was
a
german
farmer
in
ohio
his
mother
a
teacher
he
had
taken
a
degree
in
engineering
from
ohio
state
then
stumbled
upon
the
dream
job
of
his
life
he
was
now
thinking
about
moving
to
greece
i
sorry
to
have
to
make
an
example
of
you
chris
number
one
said
drawing
out
his
walther
vance
realized
he
was
in
a
satellite
clean
room
painted
a
septic
white
with
bright
fluorescents
overhead
along
one
wall
were
steel
tables
several
of
which
held
giant
glove
boxes
that
enabled
a
worker
to
handle
satellite
components
without
human
contamination
alongside
those
were
instruments
to
measure
ambient
ionization
and
dust
other
systems
in
the
room
included
banks
of
electronic
equipment
about
whose
function
he
could
only
speculate
and
what
was
that
there
just
above
the
door
it
looked
like
a
tv
monitor
it
seemed
to
be
displaying
the
vague
movements
of
a
large
control
room
one
with
banks
of
computer
screens
in
long
rows
and
marshaled
lines
of
technicians
monitoring
them
he
studied
the
picture
for
a
second
wondering
why
it
seemed
so
familiar
and
then
he
realized
it
looked
just
like
tv
shots
of
the
kennedy
space
center
shivering
from
the
cold
he
moved
closer
to
the
screen
which
was
just
clear
enough
to
allow
him
to
make
out
some
of
the
figures
in
what
had
to
be
the
command
center
however
he
saw
only
staffers
no
sign
of
bill
bates
one
individual
stood
out
his
suit
and
tie
a
marked
contrast
to
the
general
atmosphere
and
he
looked
like
he
was
giving
the
orders
he
was
now
chatting
with
a
woman
and
another
younger
man
seated
at
a
keyboard
then
the
guy
turned
and
beckoned
one
of
the
staffers
forward
he
said
something
to
him
and
then
jesus
he
pulled
a
pistol
no
cally
screamed
but
it
was
already
too
late
before
chris
schneider
even
saw
it
coming
ramirez
shot
him
precisely
between
the
eyes
neatly
and
without
fanfare
the
precision
was
almost
clinical
and
he
was
dead
by
the
time
he
collapsed
onto
the
gray
linoleum
tiles
of
the
floor
his
body
lay
motionless
his
head
nestled
in
a
growing
pool
of
dark
blood
georges
lefarge
looked
on
unbelieving
had
he
really
seen
it
no
it
was
too
grotesque
chris
murdered
in
cold
blood
right
before
his
eyes
they
had
been
talking
only
yesterday
about
going
to
crete
for
the
weekend
maybe
renting
a
car
death
had
always
been
an
abstraction
never
anything
to
view
up
close
he
had
never
seen
a
body
he
had
never
even
imagined
such
things
could
really
happen
it
was
only
in
the
movies
right
until
this
moment
he
had
never
confronted
actual
murder
ever
in
his
life
calypso
andros
felt
a
shock
then
a
surge
of
emotional
novocain
as
her
adrenaline
pumped
right
then
and
there
she
decided
that
she
was
going
to
kill
this
bastard
herself
personally
with
her
own
hands
number
one
whoever
he
was
was
a
monster
no
revenge
then
the
superego
intervened
he
still
got
the
gun
wait
and
get
the
son
of
a
bitch
when
he
not
expecting
it
georges
she
said
quietly
finally
collecting
herself
you
better
do
what
he
says
lefarge
was
still
too
astonished
to
think
let
alone
talk
this
horror
was
outside
every
realm
of
reason
he
had
no
way
to
file
it
within
any
known
category
contained
in
his
mind
she
is
giving
you
excellent
advice
number
one
was
saying
you
would
be
wise
to
listen
in
any
case
i
merely
want
you
to
demonstrate
the
technical
capabilities
of
this
system
he
smiled
as
though
nothing
had
happened
an
intellectual
exercise
georges
looked
at
cally
and
watched
her
nod
her
eyes
seemed
almost
empty
was
it
shock
how
could
she
manage
to
carry
on
well
he
thought
if
she
can
do
it
then
so
can
i
slowly
he
revolved
and
examined
the
computer
terminal
in
front
of
him
the
cool
green
of
the
screen
was
all
that
remained
recognizable
the
only
thing
to
which
he
could
still
relate
all
right
he
barely
heard
his
own
words
as
he
glanced
down
at
the
sheet
i
see
if
i
can
put
in
a
run
the
room
around
them
was
paralyzed
in
time
the
single
thunk
of
the
pistol
having
reverberated
louder
than
a
cannon
shot
like
georges
none
of
the
other
young
technicians
had
ever
witnessed
an
overt
act
of
violence
it
produced
a
new
reality
a
jolt
that
made
the
senses
suddenly
grow
sharper
the
hearing
more
acute
the
periphery
of
vision
wider
still
in
shock
he
typed
an
instruction
into
his
fujitsu
workstation
telling
it
to
start
the
trajectory
of
an
abort
splashdown
for
various
locations
then
he
began
typing
in
the
numbers
on
the
sheet
the
first
coordinates
he
realized
at
once
were
somewhere
close
but
where
vance
watched
the
control
room
freeze
as
the
body
slumped
to
the
floor
and
he
felt
his
fingers
involuntarily
bunch
into
a
fist
the
bastards
were
killing
hostages
already
they
definitely
were
terrorists
right
out
of
the
textbook
kill
one
and
frighten
a
thousand
except
they
might
not
stop
with
one
he
foresaw
a
long
day
and
night
the
victim
had
been
hardly
more
than
a
college
kid
murdered
at
random
and
for
no
other
apparent
reason
than
to
frighten
the
rest
into
submission
a
technique
that
was
as
old
as
brutality
but
that
terrorist
trick
management
by
intimidation
worked
both
ways
take
away
their
uzis
and
these
smug
bastards
could
just
as
easily
be
turned
into
quivering
all
human
beings
had
psychological
pressure
points
that
could
be
accessed
what
separated
the
wheat
from
the
chaff
was
what
happened
when
somebody
got
to
those
points
he
often
wondered
what
he
would
do
he
prayed
he
would
never
have
to
find
out
then
he
watched
as
the
young
man
at
the
terminal
began
typing
in
something
off
a
sheet
of
paper
whatever
the
terrorist
had
intended
to
accomplish
by
his
wanton
murder
apparently
it
had
worked
the
other
technicians
were
all
staring
down
at
their
screens
scared
to
move
whatever
had
gone
on
everybody
was
back
to
business
but
what
did
these
thugs
want
sadly
he
turned
away
from
the
screen
to
reexamine
his
surroundings
and
noticed
a
workstation
situated
off
to
the
left
side
of
the
door
what
had
bill
once
said
they
practically
had
computer
terminals
in
the
bathrooms
this
one
obviously
was
intended
for
quick
communications
with
the
command
crews
from
here
in
this
freezing
white
room
keeping
an
eye
on
the
tv
monitor
he
moved
over
to
take
a
look
instructions
began
appearing
on
the
bright
green
screen
indicating
it
was
tied
into
a
computer
network
at
the
facility
yes
somebody
probably
the
young
analyst
out
there
was
typing
in
a
complex
series
of
commands
above
that
on
the
screen
another
sequence
had
been
aborted
it
had
been
some
sort
of
run
called
that
must
have
been
what
had
jolted
him
when
he
was
out
in
the
conduit
he
studied
the
screen
trying
to
figure
out
what
was
going
on
only
the
hum
of
air
conditioning
broke
the
silence
and
the
quiet
helped
him
to
think
of
course
these
bastards
were
planning
to
use
the
cyclops
or
worse
its
spacecraft
to
what
he
recalled
seeing
the
second
chopper
arrive
and
the
boys
unload
two
crates
its
cargo
was
going
to
be
a
christmas
present
to
the
world
whatever
it
was
they
were
poised
to
deliver
it
just
about
anywhere
on
the
globe
so
what
was
their
target
he
studied
the
computer
screen
hoping
to
get
an
inkling
but
he
saw
only
numbers
in
pairs
they
looked
like
latitude
and
longitude
coordinates
what
did
that
mean
the
first
ones
were
nearby
maybe
somewhere
near
crete
so
what
were
they
doing
reprogramming
the
vehicle
into
a
missile
terrific
that
was
the
first
half
of
the
bad
news
the
second
half
was
that
whatever
they
were
up
to
there
also
seemed
a
good
chance
they
might
try
to
blow
up
the
satcom
facility
after
they
were
finished
just
to
cover
their
tracks
dead
men
make
no
ids
in
some
faraway
courtroom
years
from
now
he
could
probably
terminate
that
plan
by
just
sabotaging
some
of
the
fiber
optics
in
the
conduit
thereby
putting
the
whole
facility
out
of
commission
but
that
would
screw
bill
too
and
probably
end
up
costing
satcom
millions
bates
was
close
enough
to
being
suicidal
already
this
was
probably
going
to
put
him
over
the
edge
in
any
case
keep
that
as
a
option
he
told
himself
and
besides
everything
at
the
moment
was
only
guesswork
the
thing
to
do
first
was
to
get
a
better
handle
on
the
situation
without
the
terrorists
knowing
the
question
was
how
he
looked
around
the
room
again
wondering
and
then
his
eye
fell
on
the
terminal
and
a
thought
dawned
why
not
see
if
you
can
interrupt
the
computer
run
in
progress
and
have
a
chat
with
the
analyst
at
the
keyboard
the
one
with
the
beard
now
typing
in
the
numbers
appearing
on
the
green
screen
he
reached
down
and
tested
one
of
the
keys
but
nothing
happened
the
data
being
typed
in
just
kept
on
coming
what
now
how
to
cut
into
the
system
and
send
him
a
little
personal
get
his
attention
something
then
he
realized
the
keyboard
had
an
switch
which
was
currently
shunting
it
out
of
the
system
guess
that
to
keep
somebody
from
screwing
up
a
run
by
leaning
against
it
he
thought
how
much
time
is
there
any
minute
now
somebody
could
come
wandering
in
probably
this
window
of
opportunity
only
had
a
few
minutes
to
go
he
switched
on
the
keyboard
and
again
gave
a
letter
a
tap
this
time
it
instantly
appeared
on
the
screen
highlighted
a
glance
at
the
tv
monitor
told
him
that
the
startled
analyst
at
the
keyboard
had
frozen
his
fingers
in
bringing
everything
to
a
halt
quickly
he
started
typing
hoping
that
none
of
the
terrorists
had
the
brains
to
be
monitoring
the
computers
do
stop
just
answer
the
young
analyst
he
could
tell
from
the
monitor
had
a
funny
look
on
his
face
obvious
even
through
his
scraggly
beard
but
he
was
cool
who
are
you
came
back
the
answer
a
friend
need
information
fast
how
many
terrorists
ten
the
reply
appeared
but
i
think
one
was
killed
plus
those
who
came
in
on
the
sikorsky
this
morning
vance
thought
looked
like
another
three
then
he
typed
in
another
question
what
do
they
want
do
know
maybe
use
vehicles
the
typing
was
quick
and
experienced
they
say
facility
to
keep
operating
normally
where
is
bates
vance
typed
back
is
he
okay
in
his
office
think
he
okay
that
a
relief
he
thought
guess
bill
still
got
some
hostage
value
to
them
tell
him
ulysses
has
landed
be
of
good
cheer
the
answer
came
back
who
are
you
i
scared
they
killed
chris
i
saw
it
but
that
probably
all
for
a
while
standard
terror
tactics
now
erase
this
conversation
something
was
typed
on
the
screen
and
their
words
immediately
all
disappeared
and
just
in
time
rais
had
finished
retrieving
the
box
of
krytrons
from
the
cockpit
of
the
huey
and
was
headed
down
the
elevator
for
the
area
directly
below
and
south
of
the
launch
facility
the
clean
room
where
expensive
communications
satellites
were
going
to
be
prepped
for
launch
abdoullah
was
a
jerk
but
he
had
been
right
about
that
it
was
the
obvious
location
to
install
the
detonators
and
set
the
timing
mechanisms
as
the
elevator
door
opened
his
uzi
was
still
holstered
just
below
his
right
hip
and
in
his
hands
was
the
box
of
detonators
all
carefully
secured
in
their
beds
of
he
stepped
into
the
hallway
then
headed
down
for
the
closed
door
of
the
clean
room
william
bates
i
must
say
made
a
wise
choice
when
he
hired
you
to
run
this
project
miss
andros
ramirez
was
saying
he
had
just
lit
a
new
cigar
i
have
to
commend
his
judgment
well
if
you
think
i
doing
such
a
great
job
you
better
let
me
go
on
doing
it
cally
managed
to
answer
trying
to
get
a
grip
on
herself
she
had
her
arms
crossed
mainly
to
try
to
keep
her
hands
from
shaking
when
chris
was
shot
she
was
so
stunned
she
repressed
the
horror
now
the
numbness
was
wearing
off
and
she
wanted
to
scream
just
one
long
wail
to
purge
everything
she
was
biting
her
lip
to
try
to
repress
the
impulse
i
need
to
go
down
to
the
launch
facility
and
check
with
the
tech
crews
toughen
up
and
think
she
told
herself
these
terrorists
are
up
to
something
and
the
sooner
you
figure
out
what
it
is
the
better
for
everybody
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
nodded
i
need
to
go
down
myself
and
see
how
things
are
proceeding
so
why
do
we
both
go
miss
andros
around
here
i
called
dr
andros
she
was
feeling
her
control
coming
back
two
could
play
the
power
game
but
of
course
he
nodded
in
a
professional
environment
we
all
like
to
be
treated
accordingly
i
respect
that
and
expect
no
less
myself
he
surveyed
the
room
its
satcom
technicians
still
stunned
then
his
eye
caught
the
tall
bearded
iranian
salim
now
lounging
by
the
door
with
his
uzi
and
motioned
him
over
get
this
body
out
of
here
the
iranian
nodded
and
strolled
over
cally
studied
him
wondering
she
had
been
trying
to
size
up
the
team
for
some
time
and
she
still
had
not
figured
them
all
out
but
this
one
and
defiantly
bearded
seemed
somewhat
at
odds
with
the
others
he
clearly
had
no
taste
to
clean
up
number
one
murder
you
could
see
it
in
his
eyes
where
in
the
lobby
it
disrupting
the
professional
environment
he
nodded
again
and
without
a
word
grabbed
chris
schneider
by
the
shoulders
and
began
dragging
him
past
andros
number
one
turned
back
to
her
already
i
feel
closer
to
you
than
i
do
to
half
of
my
men
i
think
you
and
i
will
make
a
good
team
you
have
got
to
be
fucking
kidding
he
merely
laughed
then
spoke
to
another
of
the
terrorists
a
young
arab
after
apparently
ordering
him
to
stay
behind
in
command
to
keep
an
eye
on
things
he
motioned
cally
to
lead
the
way
through
the
security
doors
they
edged
around
salim
still
moving
the
body
and
out
into
the
lobby
the
first
thing
she
noticed
was
that
the
guard
was
missing
from
the
front
security
station
instead
a
wide
dark
stain
covered
the
desk
blood
she
whirled
on
number
one
what
happened
to
milos
you
bastard
regrettably
he
is
no
longer
with
us
he
shrugged
not
pausing
as
he
took
her
arm
and
shoved
her
on
you
mean
you
murdered
him
too
she
felt
herself
about
to
explode
she
had
loved
that
greek
who
spent
more
time
worrying
about
soccer
scores
than
he
did
about
security
thinking
about
his
death
she
felt
a
wave
of
nausea
sweep
over
her
you
bloodthirsty
please
we
going
to
try
to
be
professionals
remember
he
interrupted
her
calmly
we
will
be
working
together
in
the
days
ahead
and
animosity
will
serve
no
purpose
she
thought
of
several
responses
but
squelched
them
all
talking
was
going
to
make
things
any
better
in
that
respect
he
was
right
talk
would
have
no
effect
they
were
facing
the
tunnel
leading
to
the
systems
sector
at
the
other
end
of
the
island
the
large
metal
doors
operated
from
the
security
system
at
the
desk
had
been
opened
slid
back
and
permanently
secured
the
circuiting
of
the
security
system
had
disabled
all
the
electronic
locks
in
the
facility
scrutinizing
them
she
felt
sadness
all
the
months
of
and
technical
calibration
throughout
the
facility
had
all
that
effort
been
wasted
probably
not
she
suspected
these
goons
true
to
their
word
had
taken
great
pains
not
to
disturb
anything
in
command
so
far
everything
had
apparently
conformed
to
their
plan
except
for
something
to
do
with
a
helicopter
whatever
that
was
it
had
taken
them
by
surprise
what
was
it
ramirez
said
nothing
as
they
started
down
the
asphalt
pavement
of
the
underground
passageway
over
a
thousand
meters
long
and
illuminated
by
fluorescent
lighting
its
cinderblock
walls
were
wide
and
high
enough
to
accommodate
a
standard
greek
truck
or
two
small
lorries
cally
noted
the
deserted
guard
desk
at
the
far
end
had
he
been
killed
as
well
she
wondered
let
me
put
your
mind
at
ease
number
one
announced
as
though
reading
her
thoughts
the
other
guards
have
merely
been
disarmed
and
locked
in
their
quarters
as
i
said
we
have
no
desire
for
any
unnecessary
bloodshed
more
lies
she
tossed
her
hair
you
should
try
to
believe
me
again
trust
will
make
things
easier
for
us
both
she
pushed
past
the
doors
at
the
end
of
the
passageway
and
together
they
entered
the
first
sector
launch
control
beyond
another
set
of
doors
led
to
the
giant
underground
installation
for
the
superconducting
coil
which
fed
into
a
massive
glass
tube
holding
the
wiggler
heart
of
the
cyclops
above
that
now
unseen
stood
the
launch
vehicles
rockets
that
carried
no
fuel
neither
was
yet
primed
they
planned
to
ready
the
vehicle
designated
just
before
launch
in
fact
nothing
had
happened
since
the
test
the
night
before
tech
crews
were
checking
the
instruments
knowing
only
that
a
communications
breakdown
with
command
had
occurred
and
some
strange
visitors
had
shown
up
in
a
helicopter
something
was
going
on
but
nobody
knew
what
a
very
impressive
installation
number
one
said
watching
as
the
technicians
all
nodded
their
greetings
incidentally
there
is
no
point
in
alarming
any
of
them
now
for
the
moment
you
should
just
proceed
normally
that
why
you
here
right
she
shot
back
to
make
sure
all
this
normality
things
were
pretty
normal
before
you
and
your
band
of
thugs
barged
in
we
are
colleagues
now
andros
i
here
to
observe
the
we
all
are
so
anxious
for
please
for
starters
i
would
like
to
tag
along
and
have
you
show
me
around
you
a
congenial
guide
you
bet
she
thought
you
discover
how
congenial
i
am
soon
enough
of
course
she
had
not
yet
formulated
a
strategy
one
bright
spot
was
the
voice
on
the
radio
this
morning
was
somebody
on
the
island
still
free
she
had
peeked
out
into
the
lobby
long
enough
to
learn
that
the
mysterious
guard
had
shot
one
of
the
germans
and
then
escaped
so
who
was
it
that
was
what
she
wanted
to
find
out
next
but
first
business
she
approached
jordan
jaegar
a
young
cal
tech
graduate
and
friend
of
georges
who
had
been
with
the
project
from
the
start
how
long
did
the
coil
temperature
stay
nominal
although
he
had
a
master
in
mechanical
engineering
jordan
sported
hair
and
had
just
gotten
a
tattoo
on
his
right
bicep
an
elaborate
rendering
of
his
initials
which
he
much
preferred
to
be
called
he
liked
the
fact
andros
remembered
that
for
just
over
minutes
he
announced
with
pride
his
eyes
discreetly
taking
in
her
hourglass
figure
long
enough
then
it
started
creeping
up
but
we
have
almost
inserted
into
orbit
by
that
time
and
after
minutes
it
was
only
five
degrees
celsius
higher
no
sweat
dr
andros
who
was
wondering
was
this
hotshot
standing
next
to
andros
he
had
seen
a
lot
of
satcom
brass
come
and
go
but
this
dude
was
definitely
new
what
was
his
scene
no
question
though
the
boss
lady
was
really
pissed
about
something
she
also
did
not
seem
interested
in
introducing
this
new
creep
to
anyone
fine
there
was
enough
to
worry
about
without
more
brass
cally
nodded
the
readout
in
command
showed
that
the
cyclops
reached
saturation
at
twelve
point
gigawatts
right
agreed
the
wiggler
went
critical
and
we
used
the
phased
array
to
dissipate
the
energy
he
beamed
hell
we
could
have
sent
her
up
last
night
the
whole
thing
was
textbook
he
knew
she
already
knew
all
that
but
he
figured
there
was
no
harm
in
impressing
this
creep
that
all
the
money
they
spent
had
been
wasted
satcom
was
definitely
from
his
section
management
had
to
be
happy
payoff
time
was
just
around
the
corner
this
time
next
week
satcom
stock
was
going
to
be
pure
gold
after
went
up
there
would
be
any
more
shit
from
arlington
they
be
passing
out
stock
bonuses
like
fucking
peppermints
he
figured
a
hot
new
nissan
was
definitely
in
his
future
good
andros
said
but
she
seemed
distracted
having
trouble
staying
focused
something
was
definitely
wrong
but
she
was
hiding
it
how
about
sending
a
data
summary
to
my
terminal
in
command
cally
walked
on
past
thinking
as
fast
as
she
could
none
of
the
technicians
here
knew
what
had
happened
when
they
found
out
were
they
going
to
fall
apart
endangering
everybody
and
everything
maybe
she
thought
it
would
be
better
now
to
just
continue
normally
as
long
as
possible
number
one
whoever
he
was
was
carrying
an
uzi
now
instead
he
had
a
skillfully
concealed
beneath
his
it
was
all
very
stylish
he
was
keeping
the
takeover
on
low
profile
at
least
down
here
where
the
vehicles
were
maybe
she
told
herself
he
does
feel
as
sure
of
himself
here
or
maybe
he
needs
to
keep
their
plans
a
secret
so
they
definitely
up
to
something
as
they
walked
past
the
massive
steel
housings
enclosing
the
controls
ramirez
suddenly
paused
and
cleared
his
throat
andros
what
is
the
payload
for
the
test
launching
you
certainly
would
put
a
communications
satellite
at
peril
during
your
maiden
run
he
is
stupid
she
thought
he
understands
the
economics
of
the
satellite
business
it
just
a
test
with
a
dummy
payload
good
we
will
have
a
real
payload
for
you
it
wo
be
but
it
will
definitely
get
you
some
attention
we
at
that
moment
his
crackled
abdoullah
had
completed
his
inspection
and
together
with
shujat
was
loading
the
crates
back
onto
the
small
trucks
intended
to
move
them
down
to
the
clean
room
we
have
to
adjust
the
timers
very
carefully
he
was
saying
to
shujat
now
bent
over
with
him
make
sure
they
synched
critically
with
the
trajectory
the
second
pakistani
engineer
nodded
right
so
we
do
it
when
the
trajectory
computer
runs
are
completed
that
scheduled
for
hours
tonight
sounds
good
abdoullah
clicked
on
his
black
a
small
kenwood
and
tried
to
sound
professional
firebird
two
to
firebird
one
do
you
read
there
was
a
burst
of
static
and
then
ramirez
voice
sounded
i
copy
you
firebird
two
any
problems
negative
the
items
look
in
perfect
condition
we
are
taking
them
down
to
the
clean
room
now
to
install
the
detonators
fine
ramirez
replied
i
meet
you
there
the
radio
voice
paused
incidentally
be
aware
there
is
somebody
loose
on
the
island
who
seems
a
trifle
out
of
synch
with
the
situation
where
is
he
he
was
signaling
for
shujat
to
come
over
and
listen
having
a
problem
or
two
always
made
things
more
fun
probably
up
at
the
communications
complex
on
the
mountain
so
far
only
been
a
nuisance
but
the
matter
will
have
to
be
resolved
in
the
meantime
do
let
anything
slow
down
your
work
we
need
to
be
prepared
for
the
next
phase
including
whatever
time
flexibility
we
might
need
abdoullah
did
not
exactly
like
the
sound
of
that
he
had
a
troubling
feeling
that
number
one
was
exactly
telling
everybody
the
whole
plan
he
was
not
a
man
you
instinctively
trusted
who
the
hell
was
he
really
of
course
in
this
business
you
did
necessarily
trust
anybody
but
still
when
you
were
working
together
it
was
nice
to
think
that
everybody
was
on
the
same
wavelength
in
his
view
a
lot
of
questions
still
needed
answering
like
where
had
the
money
come
from
to
mount
this
operation
the
preparations
the
bribes
the
equipment
and
the
second
chopper
the
sikorsky
the
hind
he
knew
had
been
stolen
the
payments
to
all
the
third
parties
involved
everything
had
required
money
tons
of
it
but
the
man
known
as
number
one
clearly
had
all
he
needed
so
how
had
this
character
come
up
with
all
those
millions
of
bucks
his
intuition
told
him
that
not
everybody
was
going
to
make
it
to
the
safe
house
in
malta
when
the
time
came
at
the
moment
he
had
confidence
only
in
rais
and
shujat
and
rais
was
a
jerk
in
fact
he
had
seen
him
since
he
went
out
to
get
the
krytrons
from
the
cockpit
of
the
sikorsky
but
he
should
be
down
in
the
clean
room
by
now
vance
heard
a
sound
outside
the
clean
room
footsteps
somebody
was
approaching
but
not
with
a
walk
that
suggested
familiarity
with
the
place
this
might
turn
out
to
be
his
break
maybe
he
was
about
to
have
a
nice
with
one
of
the
terrorists
at
last
an
opportunity
for
some
answers
he
slipped
back
against
the
wall
next
to
the
door
his
wet
clothes
chilling
him
in
the
low
temperature
but
he
sensed
that
things
were
about
to
warm
up
the
person
behind
the
door
paused
for
a
second
then
shoved
it
open
a
box
appeared
then
a
face
it
was
young
and
cocky
do
even
think
about
making
a
sound
asshole
he
slapped
his
walther
against
the
guy
cheek
then
yanked
the
uzi
from
his
leg
holster
and
pulled
him
into
the
room
next
he
kicked
the
door
shut
and
shoved
his
new
guest
to
the
floor
the
box
he
was
carrying
thumped
down
beside
him
in
the
glare
of
the
fluorescents
the
terrorist
looked
like
an
aging
graduate
student
except
he
was
wearing
a
palestinian
vance
ripped
it
away
rolled
him
over
and
inserted
the
uzi
into
his
mouth
a
metal
barrel
loosening
the
teeth
he
knew
did
marvels
for
a
powers
of
concentration
that
was
one
of
the
first
lessons
he
picked
up
from
the
boys
at
arm
and
this
one
was
no
exception
he
stared
up
genuine
terror
in
his
eyes
and
moaned
speak
english
just
nod
he
dipped
his
forehead
forward
eyes
still
in
shock
good
now
we
going
to
play
twenty
questions
that
about
the
number
of
teeth
you
got
so
each
time
i
get
an
answer
i
do
buy
one
of
them
goes
and
when
we
run
out
of
teeth
you
wo
be
able
to
talk
any
more
so
i
just
blow
your
head
off
okay
how
we
doing
we
understand
each
other
so
far
he
nodded
again
and
gave
an
airless
grunt
great
looks
like
we
on
a
roll
now
how
many
more
of
your
team
is
in
there
hold
up
fingers
very
slowly
i
was
never
good
at
fast
arithmetic
his
eyes
were
cloudy
but
he
managed
to
lift
five
fingers
this
guy
is
one
of
the
new
arrivals
vance
thought
i
counted
three
of
them
so
that
means
two
others
are
down
here
as
well
those
first
guys
were
the
pros
but
this
kid
barely
knows
which
end
of
an
uzi
to
hold
do
they
know
you
came
back
here
he
rattled
the
barrel
of
the
uzi
around
in
his
mouth
just
to
keep
him
focused
again
he
nodded
even
more
terrified
okay
he
thought
we
going
to
have
to
make
this
a
short
chat
are
there
hostages
down
here
again
the
man
nodded
how
many
he
just
shrugged
clearly
having
no
idea
well
vance
thought
maybe
it
time
to
get
this
show
on
the
road
he
slowly
removed
the
barrel
then
ripped
off
a
portion
of
the
kaffiyeh
lying
on
the
floor
balled
it
and
stuffed
it
into
his
mouth
next
he
tore
off
a
longer
strip
and
tied
it
around
his
head
securing
the
gag
the
eyes
were
still
terrified
by
the
way
he
said
what
in
the
box
a
new
look
of
horror
entered
the
eyes
he
really
scared
now
vance
thought
interesting
well
well
maybe
we
ought
to
take
a
look
he
reached
over
and
opened
the
lid
there
nestled
inside
several
layers
of
were
what
looked
like
large
oversized
blue
transistors
bingo
he
thought
what
have
we
here
could
it
be
these
are
the
tickets
to
the
upcoming
show
this
ai
chopped
liver
okay
pal
on
your
feet
we
going
to
get
moving
just
you
and
me
and
we
going
to
take
along
your
little
box
of
toys
you
can
tell
me
what
they
are
later
the
young
terrorist
started
to
rise
gingerly
see
that
opening
over
there
he
pointed
where
the
wires
enter
into
the
conduit
we
going
through
there
you
first
you
about
to
have
some
experience
in
mountain
climbing
the
workout
might
do
you
good
that
was
when
the
door
opened
chapter
nine
vance
cocked
the
pakistani
uzi
and
trained
it
on
the
door
not
sure
what
to
do
the
fear
was
that
he
might
inadvertently
kill
a
friendly
hostage
situations
always
presented
that
harrowing
possibility
quick
identifications
and
quick
decisions
were
what
made
good
antiterrorist
teams
he
was
afraid
he
had
neither
skill
he
was
even
that
great
a
shot
but
events
were
to
break
his
way
for
a
change
as
the
door
swung
in
he
saw
a
woman
framed
there
he
needed
only
to
lock
eyes
with
her
to
know
she
was
a
friendly
okay
one
id
out
of
the
way
then
a
man
behind
her
dressed
in
a
tailored
charcoal
suit
reached
out
to
seize
her
and
pull
her
in
front
of
him
no
good
as
vance
watched
mesmerized
she
elbowed
him
in
the
chin
sending
him
reeling
backward
and
out
into
the
hallway
then
before
he
could
recover
she
slammed
the
door
using
her
other
elbow
to
hit
the
blue
airlock
button
next
to
the
frame
with
electronic
efficiency
the
red
sealed
light
above
the
door
blinked
on
and
bolts
around
the
edges
clicked
into
place
she
turned
still
shaking
and
looked
at
him
please
tell
me
not
one
of
them
too
no
way
i
just
a
tourist
vance
examined
her
and
liked
her
on
the
spot
she
was
a
stunner
with
dark
hair
and
an
sweater
emblazoned
with
the
satcom
logo
one
of
those
women
made
for
the
modern
age
exhibit
a
she
just
iced
the
thug
in
the
hallway
and
who
are
you
instead
of
answering
she
glanced
over
at
the
pakistani
his
mouth
gagged
i
see
you
already
met
one
of
our
new
guests
we
got
acquainted
informally
not
exactly
a
meaningful
relationship
he
stared
at
the
door
wondering
how
long
it
would
hold
by
the
way
is
that
guy
outside
who
i
think
he
is
did
he
just
shoot
somebody
in
your
control
room
he
did
and
you
were
probably
about
to
be
next
she
took
time
to
examine
him
more
closely
he
could
tell
if
she
liked
what
she
saw
but
her
look
quickly
turned
to
puzzlement
you
soaking
wet
i
had
an
afternoon
dip
what
you
swam
here
she
looked
about
the
room
then
back
how
in
a
manner
of
speaking
who
are
you
mike
vance
he
extended
his
hand
friend
of
bill
it
a
long
story
in
real
life
i
run
a
sailboat
charter
operation
back
in
the
bahamas
and
you
cally
andros
i
run
this
place
or
at
least
i
did
until
last
night
she
shook
his
hand
tentatively
so
what
are
you
doing
here
as
i
said
just
an
island
tourist
but
i
got
to
tell
you
greek
hospitality
is
what
it
used
to
be
he
reached
down
and
picked
up
the
box
with
the
krytrons
now
what
do
you
say
we
get
out
of
here
before
that
guy
outside
comes
blasting
in
through
that
door
she
laughed
an
inch
and
a
half
of
steel
even
better
it
which
means
that
if
the
electronics
fail
it
stays
in
the
locked
mode
anyway
he
liked
her
snappy
answers
nothing
lasts
forever
i
strongly
recommend
we
do
ourselves
a
favor
and
move
along
he
turned
and
indicated
the
open
panel
where
the
wiring
entered
how
does
the
back
way
sound
to
you
you
came
in
through
there
she
clearly
was
startled
you
either
very
smart
or
very
stupid
that
where
i
tell
you
what
really
stupid
standing
around
while
those
goons
figure
out
how
to
take
out
that
door
because
there
something
in
here
i
got
a
feeling
they
going
to
want
back
very
badly
you
mean
him
she
pointed
at
the
pakistani
still
gagged
hunching
down
on
the
floor
one
doubt
that
he
just
a
water
carrier
no
i
talking
about
the
gadgets
inside
this
box
what
check
them
out
he
passed
it
over
what
do
you
think
she
lifted
out
one
of
the
units
three
wires
extending
from
one
end
and
her
dark
eyes
widened
my
god
do
you
know
what
this
is
me
it
a
krytron
she
rotated
it
in
her
hand
gently
as
though
it
were
crystal
i
never
actually
seen
one
before
only
pictures
you
can
trigger
a
nuclear
device
with
one
of
these
they
worth
millions
on
the
black
market
guess
we
just
made
the
fortune
five
hundred
he
laughed
if
we
live
long
enough
to
cash
them
in
should
be
lots
of
buyers
around
the
middle
east
do
you
realize
nightmare
finally
come
true
looks
that
way
he
sighed
terrorists
are
building
a
bomb
or
more
likely
they
managed
to
steal
one
somewhere
one
she
shivered
from
the
cold
and
pulled
at
her
sweater
must
be
more
than
one
if
they
got
all
these
detonators
but
a
bomb
is
just
another
chunk
of
enriched
uranium
without
these
right
well
if
they
planning
to
do
more
than
threaten
oh
my
god
she
froze
that
explains
why
they
got
georges
changing
trajectories
they
what
are
they
tinkering
with
your
rockets
so
far
just
the
part
but
if
they
put
a
bomb
on
who
knows
what
they
could
end
up
doing
how
does
nuclear
blackmail
sound
but
nobody
goes
to
this
much
trouble
just
to
shake
down
a
corporation
there
lots
of
easier
ways
he
paused
to
ponder
ten
to
one
it
not
satcom
they
holding
for
ransom
they
aiming
for
a
lot
higher
stakes
they
probably
planning
to
shake
down
a
country
somewhere
no
prizes
for
guessing
which
one
the
she
guessed
anyway
think
they
can
get
away
with
it
probably
not
without
these
he
closed
the
box
maybe
we
just
pulled
the
plug
so
let
take
these
and
get
out
of
here
she
glanced
down
at
the
surly
pakistani
what
about
him
we
could
take
him
with
us
as
a
bargaining
chip
but
i
do
think
he
worth
the
bother
vance
reached
over
and
turned
his
face
up
how
about
it
do
your
buddies
out
there
care
whether
you
live
or
die
his
eyes
betrayed
his
fear
they
did
not
did
really
think
so
vance
revolved
back
i
say
we
leave
him
they
probably
execute
him
anyway
for
being
a
and
losing
these
he
tucked
the
box
under
his
arm
then
turned
back
one
last
time
your
chief
we
going
to
take
good
care
of
them
the
world
insurance
policy
he
pointed
toward
the
opening
into
the
wiring
shaft
want
to
go
first
conduit
she
frowned
you
get
used
to
it
it
just
i
really
ca
believe
any
of
this
is
happening
she
turned
walked
over
and
with
only
minor
hesitation
began
climbing
through
at
that
moment
the
pakistani
suddenly
rolled
to
his
feet
and
lunged
for
the
sealed
door
vance
whirled
to
try
and
catch
him
but
it
was
too
late
he
had
already
thrown
his
body
against
the
release
button
the
seal
clicked
off
and
in
an
instant
their
security
evaporated
go
he
turned
back
and
yelled
but
she
was
already
through
what
now
he
wondered
fleetingly
stay
and
shoot
it
out
or
disappear
the
second
option
had
more
appeal
he
dived
for
the
open
grate
of
the
conduit
but
the
door
was
already
opening
the
paki
could
yell
but
when
the
door
slid
back
he
pushed
through
and
was
cut
down
by
a
fusillade
of
fire
the
impact
blew
him
back
into
the
room
sending
his
riddled
body
full
length
across
the
floor
vance
swung
around
the
uzi
and
laid
down
a
blast
of
covering
fire
through
the
doorway
which
had
the
effect
of
clearing
the
opening
for
a
second
he
got
off
a
couple
of
last
rounds
just
for
good
measure
then
turned
and
hurled
himself
into
the
communications
shaft
no
sooner
had
he
pulled
himself
inside
than
rounds
of
fire
began
ricocheting
through
behind
him
the
aim
however
was
wide
and
he
managed
to
flatten
himself
and
stay
out
of
the
way
then
the
firing
abruptly
stopped
they
must
have
seen
what
in
here
he
realized
all
the
wiring
are
you
all
right
it
was
cally
voice
somewhere
in
the
dark
ahead
i
doing
fine
he
paused
hating
the
next
part
only
one
small
problem
what
i
managed
to
drop
our
insurance
policy
on
the
floor
in
there
back
in
business
isaac
mannheim
checked
his
watch
and
then
gazed
down
the
hill
marking
the
time
with
growing
impatience
coping
with
inactivity
he
felt
was
the
most
extraordinarily
difficult
task
in
life
in
fact
he
never
understood
how
anybody
could
retire
when
three
lifetimes
would
not
be
adequate
for
all
one
dreams
the
tall
man
who
had
saved
his
life
earlier
in
the
day
had
departed
almost
an
hour
and
a
half
ago
where
was
he
this
waiting
around
was
not
accomplishing
a
damned
thing
he
rose
off
the
rock
where
he
been
sitting
and
stretched
enough
of
this
lollygagging
about
he
had
to
get
down
there
and
find
out
what
was
happening
already
he
assumed
that
something
had
interfered
with
the
schedule
this
afternoon
agenda
included
a
communications
of
the
servomechanisms
that
guided
the
transmitter
through
the
trajectory
he
had
even
warned
the
tall
stranger
about
it
before
he
descended
into
the
conduit
well
he
seemed
to
carry
luck
around
with
him
because
the
had
begun
then
suddenly
halted
but
that
meant
somebody
was
mucking
with
the
timetable
it
was
necessary
to
stop
these
people
whoever
they
were
from
causing
any
more
interference
in
times
like
these
he
figured
it
paid
to
be
pragmatic
so
give
them
a
piece
of
whatever
it
was
they
wanted
and
they
go
away
it
always
worked
even
the
student
of
the
sixties
could
have
been
tamed
with
a
few
gestures
a
handful
of
concessions
if
he
been
in
charge
the
problem
would
have
disappeared
so
this
time
he
would
take
the
initiative
these
people
had
no
reason
to
want
to
stop
the
project
which
meant
logically
that
they
had
to
be
after
something
else
so
why
not
just
let
them
have
it
and
then
get
on
with
matters
after
squinting
at
his
watch
one
last
time
he
shrugged
and
started
down
the
hill
working
his
way
through
the
rocks
and
scrub
brush
the
sun
beat
down
fiercely
making
him
thirsty
and
weak
while
the
sharp
rocks
pierced
the
lightweight
shoes
he
had
worn
for
the
plane
but
the
other
sturdier
pair
he
had
packed
was
lost
with
the
helicopter
well
so
be
it
the
first
rule
of
life
was
to
make
do
with
what
you
had
manage
around
problems
and
he
intended
to
do
exactly
that
shrugging
again
he
gingerly
continued
his
climb
on
his
left
he
was
passing
the
landing
pad
with
the
slightly
beat
up
agusta
the
sight
of
which
momentarily
discomfited
him
but
surely
bates
had
it
insured
still
the
whole
business
was
damned
irritating
start
to
finish
as
he
walked
onto
the
asphalt
of
the
connecting
roadway
and
headed
for
the
entrance
to
command
he
puzzled
over
how
these
thugs
could
have
penetrated
the
facility
in
the
first
place
and
why
security
had
not
handled
the
problem
that
was
bloody
well
what
satcom
was
paying
its
layabout
greek
guards
to
do
thev
should
have
nipped
the
whole
mess
in
the
bud
he
turned
and
scanned
the
mountain
one
last
time
but
still
spied
nobody
the
chap
who
saved
his
life
must
have
gotten
lost
or
killed
with
a
shrug
he
walked
directly
up
to
the
satcom
entry
lobby
and
shoved
open
the
glass
door
to
his
surprise
nobody
was
manning
the
security
station
and
an
ominous
dark
stain
covered
the
desk
why
had
anybody
cleaned
that
up
readying
his
lecture
he
dug
out
his
security
card
and
headed
across
toward
the
door
to
command
let
them
go
ramirez
said
we
have
what
we
need
he
bent
down
and
picked
up
the
box
what
about
the
woman
wolf
helling
asked
can
we
work
without
her
she
be
back
ramirez
seemed
to
be
thinking
aloud
i
see
to
it
but
there
are
ways
he
cut
him
off
it
not
a
problem
what
do
you
want
us
to
do
here
helling
inquired
finally
skepticism
in
his
voice
he
stepped
over
to
look
at
the
body
of
rais
staring
down
dispassionately
one
less
amateur
to
deal
with
he
had
shot
the
pakistani
by
accident
but
the
kid
was
unreliable
and
this
job
had
no
room
for
unreliability
just
get
on
with
arming
the
devices
he
said
checking
his
rolex
i
going
back
to
command
it
time
he
was
thinking
for
an
important
phone
call
i
figure
it
like
this
vance
said
trying
to
sound
confident
we
take
out
the
guy
in
charge
behead
the
dragon
and
we
solved
a
large
part
of
the
problem
he
seems
to
like
shooting
people
even
his
own
men
he
paused
then
looked
at
her
by
the
way
do
you
know
who
he
is
could
be
a
real
help
i
have
no
idea
cally
said
shaking
her
head
just
that
he
a
killer
she
was
straightening
her
clothes
after
climbing
out
of
the
conduit
and
through
the
heat
exchanger
he
murdered
chris
for
no
reason
why
would
he
do
that
her
voice
began
to
choke
and
she
stopped
vance
reached
over
and
patted
her
hand
she
had
been
through
a
lot
he
needs
to
scare
you
and
everybody
working
for
you
but
try
and
hang
on
you
be
getting
some
professional
reinforcements
soon
a
few
friends
of
mine
known
as
arm
arm
is
that
the
security
bunch
that
wired
this
facility
in
the
first
place
she
stared
at
him
then
made
a
face
some
job
what
can
i
say
he
winced
they
do
usually
have
these
problems
and
now
these
same
guys
are
going
to
come
back
and
save
us
really
comforting
try
thinking
positive
it
was
the
best
he
could
do
she
clearly
viewed
that
response
as
inadequate
but
she
was
too
exhausted
to
argue
well
at
this
point
i
do
have
any
better
ideas
but
i
worried
about
what
may
happen
if
there
a
lot
of
shooting
part
of
our
job
is
to
try
and
make
sure
nobody
gets
hurt
keep
the
friendlies
out
of
harm
way
great
her
spunk
was
coming
back
we
probably
going
to
have
to
keep
them
out
of
the
way
of
your
incompetent
rescuers
as
well
have
faith
these
guys
had
plenty
of
experience
it
wo
be
the
first
time
and
what
about
you
she
looked
him
over
again
how
much
experience
have
you
had
you
want
an
honest
answer
i
take
it
that
means
none
pretty
close
so
till
they
get
here
we
just
he
settled
under
a
tree
and
leaned
back
against
the
trunk
now
how
about
describing
their
leading
man
i
did
get
a
very
good
look
at
him
she
was
quiet
for
a
moment
as
though
to
collect
her
memories
and
then
she
produced
a
description
so
thorough
it
would
have
impressed
a
mossad
intelligence
officer
by
the
time
she
finished
vance
was
grinning
well
what
do
you
know
he
alive
after
all
looks
like
arm
is
in
for
some
unfinished
business
what
do
you
mean
i
think
you
just
described
somebody
who
slipped
past
pierre
in
beirut
about
five
years
ago
he
been
in
the
terrorist
game
a
long
long
time
but
he
has
been
heard
from
since
everybody
started
believing
he
was
dead
or
hoping
you
know
who
he
is
it
could
only
be
one
guy
sabri
ramirez
he
felt
mixed
emotions
this
would
be
a
real
prize
for
pierre
and
the
others
if
they
could
get
him
the
problem
was
getting
him
nobody
had
ever
managed
to
come
close
who
that
vance
wondered
if
he
really
ought
to
tell
her
or
shade
the
truth
down
a
bit
let
me
put
it
like
this
he
no
ordinary
criminal
he
probably
murdered
a
hundred
people
if
you
added
up
all
the
bombings
mossad
has
been
trying
to
assassinate
the
bastard
for
fifteen
years
vance
leaned
back
his
mind
churning
and
touched
his
fingertips
together
this
puts
things
in
a
whole
new
perspective
i
knew
he
was
a
pro
had
to
be
but
we
about
to
go
up
against
the
world
terrorist
the
king
his
blue
eyes
grew
thoughtful
i
got
to
warn
pierre
asap
the
tactics
may
have
to
be
changed
what
that
supposed
to
mean
if
ramirez
thinks
he
trapped
he
just
lash
out
always
happens
he
goes
crazy
and
gets
irrational
when
he
cornered
which
means
negotiations
are
useless
jesus
she
shuddered
her
eyes
seeming
to
go
momentarily
blank
i
did
sign
on
for
this
makes
two
of
us
he
settled
back
in
the
grass
then
yanked
up
a
handful
fresh
and
fragrant
and
sniffed
it
i
came
for
sun
and
sea
not
to
help
a
dead
man
what
that
supposed
to
mean
she
plopped
down
beside
him
under
the
tree
seems
reasonable
to
guess
he
been
quote
dead
unquote
for
five
years
because
he
wants
to
be
it
not
a
bad
condition
to
be
in
for
one
thing
people
stop
looking
for
you
you
can
start
reusing
your
old
hideaways
and
then
you
can
put
together
a
really
big
score
the
hyena
returns
the
hyena
that
what
mossad
calls
him
the
story
is
he
hates
it
but
it
sort
of
sums
up
his
line
of
work
the
hyena
the
world
hire
god
i
knew
there
was
something
about
him
although
in
a
way
he
seemed
so
the
man
in
the
brooks
brothers
suit
but
when
he
gunned
down
chris
in
cold
blood
still
this
goes
way
beyond
anything
i
could
ever
have
dreamed
looks
like
satcom
just
made
the
big
time
right
up
there
with
the
opec
ministers
he
kidnapped
in
then
auctioned
off
all
over
the
middle
east
this
is
even
bigger
it
going
to
be
the
crown
jewel
of
his
career
he
stopped
to
muse
what
it
like
to
be
famous
and
officially
dead
at
the
same
time
maybe
the
best
thing
would
be
if
he
were
really
dead
you
read
my
mind
mr
president
it
was
the
voice
of
alicia
on
the
intercom
a
call
holding
on
line
three
it
dr
mannheim
he
glanced
up
distracted
in
the
interest
of
more
space
the
operation
had
moved
from
the
oval
office
to
the
cabinet
room
where
portrait
of
george
washington
gazed
down
on
the
papers
strewn
around
the
table
seated
there
with
him
were
his
chief
of
staff
morton
davies
the
special
assistant
for
national
security
affairs
theodore
brock
head
of
the
joint
chiefs
ed
briggs
as
well
as
the
head
of
the
cia
and
the
secretary
of
defense
the
vice
president
was
giving
a
speech
at
a
california
but
his
contribution
was
not
particularly
desired
or
missed
let
him
make
speeches
and
wave
the
flag
he
reached
over
and
picked
up
the
handset
tell
him
i
get
back
to
him
is
he
at
home
he
calling
from
somewhere
in
greece
the
satcom
damn
ca
i
call
him
back
i
really
do
have
time
i
think
you
might
want
to
take
this
sir
her
voice
was
crisp
and
neutral
as
always
but
he
knew
what
the
edge
in
her
intonation
meant
this
is
priority
satcom
suddenly
it
clicked
he
had
been
too
distracted
for
the
name
to
register
at
first
he
almost
babbling
something
about
a
helicopter
he
put
him
on
and
have
the
damned
thing
traced
he
hit
the
speaker
button
isaac
what
johan
he
got
a
gun
at
my
head
the
voice
was
unmistakable
it
had
made
students
quake
for
forty
years
it
had
made
now
it
was
quivering
he
had
never
heard
his
old
professor
in
such
a
state
very
very
unlike
isaac
dr
mannheim
they
made
me
call
this
number
i
know
i
not
supposed
who
they
the
connection
was
intermittent
but
he
still
could
make
it
out
the
he
paused
then
seemed
to
be
reading
the
resistance
front
for
a
free
europe
they
taken
over
the
satcom
facility
here
everybody
they
shot
down
my
helicopter
they
killed
what
did
you
say
helicopter
hansen
pulse
quickened
was
isaac
talking
about
the
israeli
hind
that
had
attacked
the
glover
and
what
was
this
resistance
front
for
something
or
other
free
europe
europe
was
already
free
maybe
too
damned
free
given
all
the
ethnic
turmoil
the
connection
chattered
then
another
voice
sounded
hansen
noted
a
trace
of
an
accent
but
he
could
identify
it
johan
hansen
this
is
to
inform
you
that
all
the
american
engineers
here
are
safe
at
the
moment
we
have
no
desire
to
harm
anyone
we
merely
want
our
demand
addressed
hansen
glanced
at
brock
who
nodded
then
pushed
a
button
next
to
the
phone
that
allowed
him
to
record
both
sides
of
the
conversation
this
had
better
not
be
a
prank
it
no
prank
the
staff
of
satcom
is
now
hostage
listen
whoever
you
are
the
united
states
of
america
negotiate
with
hostage
takers
we
never
have
before
and
we
not
about
to
start
now
i
afraid
the
rules
of
the
past
no
longer
apply
in
fact
i
have
no
desire
to
negotiate
either
there
is
nothing
to
negotiate
we
have
a
very
simple
demand
and
you
have
no
alternative
you
got
that
backwards
whoever
you
are
you
have
no
alternatives
you
can
release
whatever
hostages
you
have
and
get
the
hell
out
of
there
that
your
one
option
we
would
be
delighted
to
comply
as
i
said
to
you
we
merely
have
a
small
nonnegotiable
demand
i
assume
we
are
being
recorded
but
you
may
wish
to
take
notes
nonetheless
in
case
you
have
any
questions
if
you
talking
about
ransom
i
can
tell
you
now
it
absolutely
unthinkable
that
kind
of
intransigence
will
get
us
nowhere
he
sighed
a
faint
hiss
over
the
line
and
then
continued
you
may
consider
our
demand
as
merely
a
small
repayment
to
the
muslim
peoples
large
portions
of
whose
homeland
america
has
seen
fit
to
devastate
that
payment
will
be
eight
hundred
million
dollars
to
be
delivered
according
to
conditions
that
will
be
specified
by
fax
i
assume
you
will
wish
some
time
to
make
the
arrangements
you
have
hours
you
out
of
your
mind
hansen
said
firmly
you
got
a
hell
of
a
nerve
even
do
make
me
repeat
myself
i
will
fax
you
the
bank
information
as
i
said
you
have
hours
if
you
have
not
the
funds
by
that
time
an
american
military
installation
in
europe
will
be
incinerated
and
without
your
frigate
glover
sent
to
spy
on
the
islamic
peoples
of
the
region
you
will
have
no
inkling
where
that
installation
will
be
just
what
do
you
think
you
going
to
do
the
same
thing
america
once
did
to
japan
only
this
time
with
a
little
help
from
one
of
your
allies
hansen
pulled
up
short
was
this
the
nightmare
every
president
had
feared
a
nuclear
device
in
the
hands
of
terrorists
no
this
took
it
one
step
further
the
terrorists
had
just
seized
the
means
to
deliver
the
device
it
was
that
nightmare
compounded
he
glanced
at
ed
briggs
whose
face
had
just
turned
ashen
they
both
were
thinking
the
same
thing
what
kind
of
military
action
was
possible
the
answer
was
not
going
to
be
simple
then
he
turned
back
to
the
phone
listen
i
want
he
paused
because
the
line
had
gone
dead
how
does
an
eta
of
hours
sound
to
you
dimitri
spiros
was
using
an
unsecured
radio
but
he
had
no
choice
that
give
us
about
hours
enough
time
to
get
everything
together
i
have
the
welcome
mat
out
vance
radio
voice
was
interrupted
periodically
with
static
the
man
sounded
stressed
out
but
spiros
had
already
interrogated
him
about
the
overall
situation
our
plan
right
now
is
to
come
in
by
seaplane
set
down
two
klicks
to
the
north
and
stage
the
actual
insertion
using
zodiacs
pierre
wants
to
get
everything
together
here
in
athens
by
hours
tomorrow
that
firm
we
have
a
briefing
and
then
you
know
the
rest
try
not
to
overfly
this
place
it
pretty
small
and
there
are
lots
of
islands
down
in
this
part
of
the
world
michael
i
greek
for
godsake
he
bristled
we
make
it
seas
permitting
and
the
weather
looks
like
a
go
for
now
all
right
here
the
drill
right
now
there
are
friendlies
in
command
and
down
at
launch
you
have
the
plans
for
that
right
right
and
how
about
the
bates
motel
the
living
quarters
at
the
moment
i
think
they
got
some
friendlies
in
there
too
but
it
currently
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
the
facility
no
communications
of
any
kind
and
it
not
heavily
guarded
we
can
worry
about
it
last
the
heavy
hitters
and
the
hardware
will
be
at
the
two
other
places
what
else
do
you
know
spiros
pressed
it
gets
even
better
these
guys
have
got
at
least
one
nuclear
device
all
signs
are
they
have
plans
probably
to
use
the
cyclops
system
for
delivery
i
do
like
the
sound
of
that
spiros
said
who
leading
it
this
is
the
very
best
part
i
think
it
might
be
ramirez
sabri
the
hyena
could
be
he
snorted
in
disbelief
no
way
the
kommissar
has
had
him
dead
for
three
years
the
hyena
has
many
lives
i
actually
got
a
look
at
him
plastic
surgery
maybe
but
i
got
a
feeling
it
none
other
than
there
was
a
pause
as
vance
seemed
to
be
checking
something
you
know
we
probably
should
cut
this
short
these
guys
have
long
ears
but
just
a
word
of
warning
do
underestimate
what
he
capable
of
i
saw
him
shoot
a
staffer
here
in
cold
blood
just
to
get
everybody
attention
when
the
time
comes
things
are
going
to
get
rough
that
how
we
used
to
playing
until
somebody
shows
us
a
better
way
well
there
a
good
chance
they
planning
to
arm
at
least
one
of
the
vehicles
after
that
it
anybody
guess
nuclear
blackmail
could
be
anyway
the
fun
part
is
i
got
hold
of
the
triggering
mechanisms
for
about
five
minutes
and
then
you
politely
gave
them
back
it
a
long
story
are
they
all
spiros
said
then
well
do
us
all
a
favor
stay
alive
till
we
can
make
the
insertion
that
an
idea
i
could
get
with
by
the
way
do
you
have
anything
on
their
schedule
when
does
the
balloon
go
up
i
do
know
you
might
hear
something
at
your
end
ramirez
has
got
to
be
talking
to
somebody
by
now
demands
the
usual
we
need
to
find
out
what
he
wants
maybe
it
all
be
over
by
the
time
you
get
here
do
count
on
it
these
things
take
a
while
in
the
meantime
get
pierre
to
have
hans
chat
up
the
kommissar
if
germany
intel
computer
files
have
anything
he
can
probably
pull
it
out
quick
enough
i
do
have
another
information
source
vance
paused
a
new
partner
and
she
tough
she
what
the
hell
are
you
talking
about
michael
this
is
not
really
the
time
for
such
things
i
should
get
to
fraternize
with
the
hostages
one
of
the
perks
otherwise
what
do
i
get
out
of
this
job
she
also
happens
to
be
the
one
who
runs
this
place
she
gave
ramirez
the
slip
a
laugh
sounded
over
the
line
mixed
with
the
static
incidentally
she
does
think
too
much
of
your
security
job
very
funny
spiros
gruff
voice
suggested
he
did
mean
it
but
maybe
you
should
send
her
back
inside
might
actually
be
safer
there
highly
doubtful
all
right
what
about
bates
the
word
is
he
still
okay
but
they
know
who
he
is
and
i
expect
they
put
on
the
pressure
when
the
time
comes
there
an
old
professor
here
too
the
guy
who
dreamed
this
whole
thing
up
and
they
got
him
name
mannheim
first
name
isaac
why
do
you
find
out
anything
you
can
about
him
i
had
him
here
with
me
but
when
i
went
down
to
reconnoiter
he
disappeared
my
guess
is
he
wandered
off
and
got
himself
taken
sounds
like
you
on
the
case
let
synchronize
and
talk
again
tomorrow
at
hours
local
okay
we
counting
on
you
do
mind
telling
you
i
scared
outgunned
and
ramirez
has
started
killing
people
michael
we
working
as
fast
as
we
can
just
be
by
a
radio
tomorrow
dimitri
spiros
switched
off
the
microphone
and
lapsed
into
troubled
thought
events
were
getting
serious
enough
that
the
operation
had
been
moved
down
to
the
situation
room
in
the
white
house
basement
scarcely
twenty
feet
on
a
side
it
was
dominated
by
a
teak
conference
table
with
chairs
lining
the
walls
although
it
appeared
cramped
by
corporate
standards
especially
when
the
full
national
security
council
met
its
close
quarters
intensified
the
focus
needed
for
international
crisis
management
besides
in
the
new
age
of
electronic
decisions
it
was
making
up
in
technology
what
it
lacked
in
spaciousness
installed
behind
the
dark
walnut
panels
that
covered
three
of
the
walls
was
the
latest
in
electronic
equipment
including
a
variety
of
telecommunications
terminals
video
monitors
and
apparatus
for
projecting
and
manipulating
images
on
the
large
screen
on
the
fourth
wall
normally
concealed
by
a
drawn
curtain
but
now
open
and
ready
we
have
to
work
through
joint
special
operations
command
the
president
was
saying
as
he
looked
around
the
room
the
five
people
there
were
intensely
at
work
their
coat
jackets
crumpled
across
the
chairs
shirt
sleeves
pushed
back
ties
loosened
or
off
they
included
chief
of
staff
morton
davies
special
assistant
for
national
security
affairs
ted
brock
and
head
of
the
joint
chiefs
ed
briggs
so
about
to
find
out
if
this
country
has
any
counterterrorist
assault
capability
special
operations
command
had
been
created
in
the
eighties
after
the
string
of
embarrassing
communication
snafus
during
the
grenada
invasion
headquartered
at
macdill
air
force
base
in
florida
it
had
overall
control
and
supervision
of
america
major
commando
units
i
guess
the
first
decision
they
have
to
make
he
continued
is
who
we
should
send
in
there
were
two
options
the
navy
had
a
unit
team
six
operating
out
of
the
little
creek
naval
amphibious
base
near
norfolk
virginia
seal
team
six
specialized
in
underwater
demolitions
clandestine
coastal
infiltrations
operations
the
other
unit
trained
to
carry
out
missions
was
delta
force
headquartered
in
a
classified
installation
at
fort
bragg
the
seals
were
high
profile
whereas
everybody
denied
the
very
existence
of
delta
assault
team
called
shooters
in
military
parlance
delta
force
was
probably
the
secret
in
america
should
we
hold
up
a
minute
and
talk
first
about
the
hostages
morton
davies
wondered
aloud
how
much
risk
is
there
there
always
risk
hansen
declared
with
anything
you
do
in
this
office
there
always
a
downside
what
was
it
harry
truman
said
about
the
place
where
the
buck
stops
well
i
got
an
uncomfortable
feeling
i
about
to
find
out
what
he
was
talking
about
he
turned
and
hit
the
intercom
alicia
get
hold
of
admiral
cutter
and
tell
him
to
get
over
here
we
got
to
get
special
operations
in
on
this
asap
yes
sir
came
the
quick
reply
despite
the
migraine
now
increasing
her
tension
she
continued
to
offer
johan
hansen
total
support
in
fact
she
rejoiced
at
the
opportunity
his
wife
off
somewhere
dedicating
flower
parks
in
america
inner
cities
certainly
provided
none
that
at
least
was
what
alicia
winston
preferred
to
think
another
worry
i
got
the
president
continued
after
he
had
clicked
off
the
intercom
is
how
to
keep
this
out
of
the
press
as
long
as
possible
if
there
any
truth
to
their
bomb
hints
we
need
to
try
and
minimize
the
panic
factor
from
here
on
every
aspect
even
the
smallest
insignificant
detail
is
classified
top
secret
israelis
will
most
certainly
get
with
that
ted
brock
observed
wryly
nervously
cleaning
his
for
what
seemed
the
tenth
time
that
hour
the
strain
was
all
over
his
face
now
the
president
continued
satcom
is
on
andikythera
do
we
have
any
photoint
of
the
island
here
yet
it
in
president
briggs
said
then
pushed
two
green
buttons
on
an
electronic
console
on
the
conference
table
a
photo
came
up
on
the
screen
behind
them
a
dull
rectangle
it
hansen
said
annoyed
he
scanned
the
photo
then
looked
around
ed
there
not
enough
detail
here
to
use
how
long
before
we
can
get
some
computer
enhancement
of
this
a
blowup
i
thought
you
would
want
that
briggs
answered
so
i
already
made
the
arrangements
we
to
nsa
we
should
be
able
to
get
it
in
about
ten
minutes
then
we
wait
he
switched
off
the
screen
and
turned
back
okay
we
have
to
start
planning
our
first
move
for
the
moment
let
talk
about
logistics
if
we
have
to
make
an
insert
what
do
we
need
well
to
begin
with
isa
would
have
to
have
hours
minimum
to
get
somebody
in
there
on
the
ground
to
gather
enough
intel
to
support
a
move
briggs
announced
almost
apologetically
the
president
sighed
isa
was
the
army
intelligence
support
activity
which
provided
intelligence
for
delta
force
and
seal
team
six
as
an
intelligence
organization
isa
was
required
to
secure
central
intelligence
agency
approval
before
entering
foreign
countries
which
meant
institutional
gridlock
and
bureaucratic
before
they
could
even
get
started
then
forget
it
we
just
have
to
use
satellite
photoint
and
pray
the
next
problem
is
who
can
we
get
there
and
how
long
would
it
take
he
knew
that
the
air
force
special
operations
wing
and
the
army
task
force
supported
missions
by
delta
force
and
the
seals
were
they
ready
well
let
back
up
a
second
briggs
interjected
we
ca
just
send
in
a
task
force
cold
they
need
to
practice
an
assault
on
something
resembling
the
same
kind
of
terrain
no
country
in
europe
the
president
knew
had
ever
given
permission
for
american
commando
bases
on
their
territory
so
why
would
they
suddenly
permit
an
assault
rehearsal
that
going
to
be
a
tough
sell
we
talking
about
greek
soil
but
if
these
terrorists
really
have
a
nuclear
device
then
the
government
of
greece
might
well
take
an
interest
in
what
happens
to
it
still
we
do
know
for
sure
it
be
they
damned
well
better
take
an
interest
briggs
declared
if
these
terrorists
plan
a
demonstration
bombing
they
could
just
be
thinking
about
the
air
and
naval
facility
at
souda
bay
which
would
mean
taking
out
the
western
end
of
crete
every
in
the
world
would
doubtless
cheer
they
claim
that
our
presence
in
a
country
makes
it
a
military
target
there
be
a
groundswell
of
sentiment
worldwide
to
send
us
packing
everywhere
the
chief
of
staff
was
thinking
do
you
suppose
these
fuckers
have
really
got
a
bomb
what
did
he
mean
about
checking
with
our
closest
allies
the
president
had
already
been
pondering
that
well
the
israelis
have
a
nuclear
arsenal
of
course
but
they
also
have
enough
safeguards
to
take
care
of
anything
they
even
shot
down
one
of
their
own
planes
once
when
it
accidentally
strayed
over
the
dimona
facility
nobody
is
going
to
steal
one
of
theirs
the
same
goes
for
south
africa
so
who
does
that
leave
stubbs
asked
he
had
a
feeling
he
already
knew
let
save
the
obvious
for
last
hansen
answered
and
let
me
give
you
a
quick
briefing
on
who
in
the
bomb
business
on
this
planet
it
just
happens
to
be
a
particular
interest
of
mine
he
leaned
back
in
the
middle
east
proper
only
one
country
presently
has
full
capability
that
is
obviously
israel
they
have
in
fact
a
lot
more
bombs
than
anybody
realizes
their
plant
at
dimona
extracts
plutonium
from
the
spent
fuel
in
their
research
reactor
there
and
cia
claims
they
got
at
least
two
hundred
strategic
nuclear
weapons
normal
plutonium
bombs
need
eight
kilograms
of
the
stuff
but
we
think
they
come
up
with
a
sophisticated
way
to
make
one
with
five
then
there
the
tactical
nukes
they
got
nuclear
artillery
shells
nuclear
landmines
in
the
golan
heights
and
hundreds
of
neutron
bombs
that
more
or
less
common
knowledge
but
what
less
well
known
is
that
they
also
got
fusion
capability
which
god
help
us
i
assume
is
not
our
problem
here
today
then
there
libya
though
they
still
trying
to
get
enough
enriched
uranium
together
to
become
a
credible
threat
having
only
one
or
two
bombs
means
that
if
you
start
anything
somebody
else
is
going
to
finish
it
so
you
need
a
lot
before
you
get
going
iraq
thankfully
has
been
put
out
of
business
of
course
there
still
india
which
has
plenty
of
unrestricted
plutonium
and
they
even
claimed
they
could
make
a
bomb
in
a
month
we
happen
to
think
already
done
it
because
he
paused
because
we
know
damned
well
pakistan
has
there
your
in
the
fuel
supply
davies
noted
the
fuckers
the
special
assistant
for
national
security
affairs
theodore
brock
who
happened
to
be
black
did
not
find
davies
alabama
remark
especially
amusing
exactly
hansen
continued
wondering
when
he
would
have
a
good
public
excuse
to
send
davies
to
greener
pastures
got
to
be
the
the
bastard
was
talking
about
it
a
muslim
country
and
their
controls
are
a
joke
it
the
obvious
choice
brock
agreed
solemnly
we
can
start
with
an
inquiry
through
their
embassy
but
it
going
to
be
sticky
the
president
nodded
wishing
he
had
a
hot
line
to
the
desk
of
every
head
of
state
in
the
world
it
would
make
this
kind
of
crisis
so
much
more
manageable
part
of
the
problem
he
thought
was
how
do
you
ask
somebody
if
lost
something
that
they
never
admitted
having
in
the
first
place
a
marvel
of
diplomacy
was
in
order
still
he
would
have
to
do
it
at
worst
a
denial
would
prove
the
terrorists
did
not
have
a
bomb
but
if
the
answer
was
affirmative
then
knowing
the
size
of
the
device
could
be
crucial
we
receiving
the
enhanced
satellite
photos
now
briggs
was
pulling
the
first
sheet
off
the
machine
looks
like
grids
he
scanned
over
it
but
i
do
see
much
there
two
big
rockets
here
but
they
seem
to
be
all
right
which
is
in
line
with
their
threat
to
use
them
hansen
observed
dryly
i
do
suppose
a
surgical
air
strike
is
possible
briggs
wondered
aloud
if
the
gulf
war
had
shown
anything
it
was
the
power
of
air
superiority
hansen
tried
unsuccessfully
to
smile
you
asking
me
to
go
to
the
greek
government
and
ask
them
if
they
would
mind
terribly
if
we
bombed
one
of
the
islands
in
their
aegean
tourist
paradise
their
cash
cow
and
by
the
way
we
probably
kill
a
few
hundred
greek
civilians
in
the
process
but
we
explain
that
we
need
to
do
this
because
i
got
an
unsettling
phone
call
with
no
proof
of
anything
he
sighed
keep
thinking
this
has
to
be
a
commando
insertion
and
frankly
i
just
as
soon
athens
got
a
phone
call
after
it
happened
not
before
for
a
lot
of
reasons
you
know
there
something
funny
right
here
briggs
was
bent
over
squinting
here
next
to
what
appears
to
be
a
radar
complex
he
looked
up
gentlemen
i
think
i
located
our
hind
or
what
left
of
it
looks
like
it
was
smashed
into
the
side
of
the
mountain
just
below
where
the
radars
are
let
me
have
a
look
the
president
stepped
over
you
mean
there
he
picked
up
a
magnifying
glass
i
no
expert
but
whatever
it
is
big
it
could
be
a
soviet
assault
helicopter
you
right
there
appear
to
be
two
other
choppers
on
the
site
as
well
briggs
continued
to
study
the
photo
one
down
here
on
the
helipad
looks
to
be
a
light
commercial
model
but
there
another
one
over
here
down
by
the
launch
vehicles
it
bigger
the
president
looked
you
right
i
see
them
that
big
one
down
by
the
vehicles
is
probably
how
they
brought
in
the
damned
bomb
if
they
actually
have
one
most
likely
the
hind
was
up
to
the
job
maybe
took
some
fire
from
the
glover
so
they
used
a
second
one
to
deliver
the
package
nice
logistics
too
damned
nice
i
beginning
to
believe
this
is
in
no
way
a
hoax
roger
ted
brock
had
been
on
the
phone
and
now
was
hanging
up
that
was
special
operations
command
sir
cutter
people
want
to
use
a
delta
task
force
but
they
need
at
least
hours
to
get
them
in
place
for
an
operation
hours
hansen
exploded
our
crack
counterterrorist
assault
force
needs
two
days
just
to
get
into
position
to
do
what
they
trained
for
well
we
be
using
an
air
force
to
deploy
the
deltas
to
souda
bay
and
then
they
need
at
least
two
combat
talons
for
the
final
insertion
those
are
all
kept
down
at
the
air
force
first
special
operations
wing
you
know
hurlburt
field
in
florida
i
know
that
ted
hansen
said
brock
nodded
sheepishly
then
continued
well
after
the
insertion
they
need
support
from
our
choppers
but
only
three
are
flying
at
the
moment
and
i
get
the
picture
the
president
cut
him
off
transportation
is
lousy
and
half
the
equipment
we
need
is
somewhere
else
or
in
maintenance
any
other
bad
news
one
thing
an
assault
would
have
to
be
at
night
it
the
only
way
that
makes
any
sense
which
means
more
special
equipment
if
they
go
in
during
daylight
it
going
to
be
a
slaughter
of
the
hostages
particularly
if
these
bastards
are
armed
the
way
we
have
to
assume
and
from
the
looks
of
everything
so
far
i
say
they
know
how
the
game
is
played
which
means
that
even
if
we
do
our
best
it
going
to
be
tricky
they
going
to
assume
we
coming
the
way
i
figure
it
even
with
no
rehearsals
hours
would
be
tight
we
invest
millions
training
the
finest
counterterrorist
units
in
the
world
and
then
they
ca
be
deployed
in
less
than
half
a
week
he
exhaled
angrily
remembering
a
classified
internal
pentagon
study
that
claimed
the
best
time
to
launch
a
successful
assault
with
the
least
number
of
casualties
among
hostages
was
within
hours
of
their
capture
it
a
goddamn
outrage
hours
minimum
president
and
even
so
that
pushing
it
he
squirmed
there
a
lot
of
paperwork
that
have
to
be
processed
and
well
tell
cutter
to
get
the
special
forces
mobilized
and
moving
hansen
interjected
in
the
meantime
our
job
is
going
to
be
to
try
and
find
out
what
happened
do
they
really
have
a
nuke
and
if
they
do
how
in
hell
did
they
get
it
and
what
are
they
planning
to
do
with
it
chapter
ten
it
very
simple
ramirez
said
to
moreau
after
the
phone
call
he
had
sent
mannheim
to
the
bates
motel
and
returned
to
launch
let
washington
stew
awhile
they
were
probably
now
trying
to
figure
out
how
to
get
their
antiterrorist
units
into
greece
their
nightmare
logistics
would
be
fun
to
watch
we
have
to
find
them
and
get
him
alive
if
possible
but
we
ca
be
fussy
the
time
to
do
it
will
be
just
after
midnight
when
we
finished
here
moreau
disagreed
i
say
the
sooner
the
better
the
longer
free
the
more
problems
they
can
cause
crossing
ramirez
was
not
something
to
be
done
lightly
but
he
felt
strongly
that
the
operation
was
not
going
as
smoothly
as
it
should
have
it
was
time
for
a
little
damage
control
well
he
probably
back
on
the
mountain
ramirez
said
calmly
if
you
want
to
then
go
on
up
and
get
him
take
the
it
light
but
be
careful
you
do
damage
anything
he
was
right
about
the
weight
at
slightly
over
ten
kilos
the
was
one
of
the
best
around
it
was
a
guerrilla
special
a
launcher
that
loosed
a
rocket
with
an
oversize
in
diameter
fired
from
the
shoulder
it
was
deadly
against
lightly
armored
vehicles
and
structures
used
on
personnel
it
was
lethal
they
had
brought
along
a
pakistani
clone
of
the
latest
soviet
model
a
version
that
was
easy
to
move
about
yet
assembled
quickly
but
remember
ramirez
went
on
so
far
all
we
have
to
show
for
trying
to
take
out
this
nuisance
is
a
wrecked
helo
do
botch
it
again
that
was
because
you
left
the
work
to
german
amateurs
moreau
remarked
dryly
this
time
i
take
care
of
it
myself
personally
i
counting
on
that
ramirez
said
his
eyes
expressionless
behind
his
gray
shades
we
be
working
together
kid
dore
peretz
was
saying
we
a
team
he
swept
back
his
mane
of
hair
then
moved
next
to
georges
lefarge
the
young
engineer
did
like
anything
about
the
israeli
right
down
to
the
cheap
aftershave
he
was
wearing
but
he
had
to
admit
the
guy
seemed
unfazed
by
all
the
hardware
that
controlled
big
benny
the
fujitsu
supercomputer
it
was
a
correct
assessment
dore
peretz
was
definitely
in
his
element
he
had
taken
his
from
the
university
of
chicago
in
then
returned
to
israel
to
accept
a
research
job
at
the
weizman
institute
israel
secret
nuclear
facility
near
tel
aviv
during
the
next
seven
years
he
had
advanced
to
the
level
of
senior
institute
scientist
becoming
an
expert
in
every
technology
connected
with
nuclear
weapons
from
the
specialty
of
mass
destruction
he
graduated
to
another
hot
topic
the
emerging
preeminence
of
smart
weapons
conventional
delivery
technologies
the
war
in
the
gulf
had
shown
were
no
match
for
the
new
smart
antimissile
systems
it
was
back
to
the
drawing
board
what
israel
needed
in
her
arsenal
was
the
next
generation
of
weaponry
he
had
gone
on
to
head
up
a
research
team
that
played
computerized
war
games
studying
the
what
ifs
of
whole
new
generations
of
technologies
matched
against
each
other
the
end
result
of
this
fascination
was
that
he
became
a
computer
and
expert
which
when
added
to
his
knowledge
of
nuclear
weapons
made
him
a
man
it
also
made
him
perfect
for
what
sabri
ramirez
wanted
to
do
when
ramirez
found
him
he
already
had
departed
the
institute
and
also
for
reasons
that
suited
ramirez
perfectly
whereas
dore
peretz
had
an
iq
off
the
scale
his
social
development
was
considered
even
by
those
who
tried
to
like
him
as
scarcely
progressed
beyond
the
infantile
his
was
an
independent
make
that
irreverent
temperament
that
was
bound
to
clash
with
the
bureaucracy
of
a
straitlaced
place
like
the
institute
he
had
particular
trouble
fitting
in
with
the
serious
environment
that
surrounded
military
contract
research
the
problem
had
been
obvious
from
the
first
day
he
arrived
but
his
genius
was
such
that
it
had
been
overlooked
and
worked
around
by
both
sides
his
final
rupture
with
the
israeli
defense
establishment
resulted
from
what
to
his
mind
was
a
totally
compelling
event
he
had
personally
developed
a
program
that
provided
special
procedures
for
the
quick
arming
of
a
nuclear
device
in
case
israel
found
itself
facing
an
imminent
attack
it
was
important
and
it
worked
he
had
expected
reasonably
enough
a
rousing
financial
tribute
for
this
effort
or
at
the
very
least
a
citation
what
he
got
instead
was
screwed
when
the
yearly
summary
of
technical
research
arrived
on
his
desk
january
last
he
discovered
the
computer
program
had
been
created
by
the
vice
president
in
charge
of
his
section
with
the
assistance
of
someone
named
peretz
a
reaming
by
an
incompetent
bureaucrat
whom
he
had
hated
from
the
beginning
was
the
last
straw
he
resigned
in
traditional
style
papering
the
institute
with
a
fusillade
of
memos
that
reviewed
in
detail
the
failings
of
its
top
management
and
then
for
good
measure
scrambling
the
electronic
combination
on
his
personal
safe
as
he
was
readying
to
walk
out
the
door
at
that
point
he
did
not
know
what
he
wanted
to
do
next
but
he
was
damned
sure
it
would
not
involve
further
interaction
with
a
bureaucracy
being
no
dummy
he
also
fully
anticipated
the
response
to
his
outrage
and
sure
enough
he
found
he
had
transformed
himself
into
a
profile
security
risk
that
mossad
suddenly
found
very
interesting
israel
intelligence
service
remembered
all
too
well
the
case
of
mordecai
vanunu
the
technician
who
had
worked
at
the
plutonium
separation
facility
at
the
dimona
complex
for
nine
years
then
left
in
a
huff
and
sold
pictures
and
a
detailed
description
of
the
facility
to
the
london
sunday
times
mossad
had
no
intention
of
letting
it
happen
again
dore
peretz
was
interrogated
for
weeks
threatened
repeatedly
then
placed
under
close
surveillance
they
had
no
grounds
to
arrest
him
but
they
were
going
to
intimidate
the
hell
out
of
him
their
harassment
however
achieved
precisely
the
opposite
effect
they
galvanized
his
anger
in
a
degree
of
soul
searching
quite
foreign
to
his
normal
mental
activity
he
found
himself
wondering
why
he
owed
israel
such
allegiance
in
the
first
place
this
was
their
thanks
for
all
his
service
so
why
not
give
it
back
to
the
bastards
in
spades
he
became
a
scientific
adviser
to
the
plo
that
only
confirmed
mossad
fears
and
intensified
their
harassment
his
phone
was
tapped
his
mail
opened
his
stylish
tel
aviv
apartment
repeatedly
and
blatantly
searched
in
his
absence
the
overall
effect
was
cumulative
rendering
him
an
critic
of
israel
conservative
coalition
government
it
was
at
this
time
when
his
name
was
being
linked
to
the
plo
that
sabri
ramirez
got
wind
of
him
and
knew
he
had
found
a
gold
mine
a
disaffected
activist
israeli
nuclear
and
rocket
expert
looking
for
a
cause
he
sounded
perfect
and
he
was
ramirez
approached
him
at
a
demonstration
supporting
a
palestinian
homeland
and
made
him
an
offer
he
could
not
refuse
how
would
he
like
to
get
rich
he
would
not
need
to
betray
his
country
merely
lend
his
skills
to
help
teach
the
americans
a
lesson
fuck
israel
he
had
declared
then
in
a
lower
voice
he
had
added
come
to
that
fuck
the
palestinians
who
were
basically
a
pain
in
the
ass
acquiring
personal
wealth
was
a
much
more
inspiring
cause
he
could
not
get
work
in
israel
any
kind
of
work
and
he
was
fast
running
through
his
savings
ramirez
advanced
him
thirty
thousand
american
dollars
on
the
spot
in
crisp
hundreds
he
immediately
dropped
his
plo
affiliation
and
began
lowering
his
profile
much
to
mossad
relief
their
surveillance
eased
up
as
they
gratefully
turned
to
more
pressing
matters
and
four
months
later
he
took
advantage
of
his
new
freedom
to
slip
into
jordan
one
night
and
from
there
make
his
way
a
week
later
to
beirut
it
was
in
that
ravaged
city
that
he
and
sabri
ramirez
worked
out
the
technical
details
of
the
plan
which
thus
far
had
gone
perfectly
we
be
modifying
the
payload
he
announced
turning
to
the
keyboard
therefore
the
weight
will
be
different
so
we
have
to
factor
that
into
the
sort
program
on
the
fujitsu
and
run
it
again
shit
lefarge
thought
he
knows
about
sort
which
probably
means
he
knows
everything
he
needs
to
make
fly
i
have
a
question
michael
vance
was
saying
they
were
still
resting
on
the
hill
and
he
felt
himself
fighting
back
waves
of
exhaustion
could
they
get
that
vehicle
down
there
off
the
ground
without
you
being
in
command
i
hate
to
admit
it
calypso
andros
exhaled
ruefully
and
leaned
back
against
the
tree
but
they
probably
could
we
already
had
a
final
test
of
the
everything
the
fujitsu
has
all
the
controls
set
there
nothing
left
to
do
except
initiate
the
launch
routine
and
then
let
the
computer
take
over
so
bill
was
about
to
be
rich
he
grinned
then
picked
up
a
small
white
stone
and
flung
it
down
the
hill
he
might
even
have
been
able
to
pay
off
our
bet
if
i
won
what
bet
was
that
long
ago
and
in
another
country
he
shrugged
hardly
caring
anymore
it
was
a
damned
stupid
stunt
we
had
a
sailor
bet
and
i
lost
as
it
happens
your
new
guests
here
pitched
in
to
help
but
those
are
the
breaks
well
let
talk
about
the
real
world
she
seemed
scarcely
to
hear
what
he
had
said
or
maybe
she
was
interested
vance
sensed
she
was
trying
to
feign
normality
adopting
a
facade
that
denied
the
horror
of
watching
her
young
technician
being
shot
dead
do
you
think
going
to
kill
anybody
else
what
should
i
say
he
wondered
feed
her
a
comforting
lie
or
tell
her
the
truth
he
looked
her
over
and
decided
on
the
latter
hate
to
say
it
but
if
it
really
ramirez
he
kill
anybody
he
vaguely
feels
like
i
saw
him
hit
a
frigate
with
a
swatter
got
to
call
that
mass
murder
a
ton
of
casualties
and
for
no
good
reason
he
caught
himself
before
he
said
more
the
memory
still
chilling
then
again
i
guess
he
not
going
to
take
out
anybody
important
or
technically
crucial
at
least
for
now
which
should
include
bates
and
mannheim
he
got
to
be
figuring
he
can
use
the
big
names
for
headlines
and
leverage
if
he
needs
it
i
ca
believe
that
the
is
going
to
send
in
the
marines
especially
when
they
find
out
he
got
a
bomb
do
get
your
hopes
up
there
are
a
couple
of
problems
with
that
the
first
is
that
they
may
not
be
allowed
on
greek
soil
and
even
if
they
are
it
could
take
several
days
for
them
to
mount
an
operation
that
one
she
looked
at
him
what
the
other
the
other
is
that
if
the
should
decide
to
mount
an
assault
it
could
well
turn
into
a
bloodbath
i
almost
wishing
they
do
delta
force
and
the
seals
are
well
trained
but
as
far
as
anybody
knows
they
never
been
used
to
carry
out
a
straight
probably
come
in
here
like
john
wayne
and
tear
this
place
apart
i
do
even
want
to
think
about
the
carnage
his
voice
trailed
off
take
it
from
me
the
people
arm
is
sending
in
are
better
suited
for
the
job
at
hand
they
also
can
deploy
a
lot
quicker
than
the
government
well
somebody
better
come
and
soon
she
had
caught
a
strand
of
her
tangled
hair
and
was
twisting
it
distractedly
making
the
tangle
worse
what
do
you
think
these
thugs
really
want
i
guess
money
part
of
the
package
but
since
ramirez
does
seem
to
be
trying
to
extort
satcom
at
least
not
yet
he
probably
has
something
bigger
in
mind
he
slowly
turned
to
her
tell
me
something
these
vehicles
are
intended
to
go
into
orbit
right
but
what
if
one
did
make
it
he
had
a
sudden
thought
or
what
if
one
of
them
did
make
it
and
then
the
orbital
trajectory
got
altered
somehow
retrofire
and
reentry
you
could
set
it
down
pretty
much
where
you
wanted
could
you
she
stared
at
him
uncertainly
what
are
you
suggesting
that
there
are
two
ways
to
play
this
somebody
could
use
these
vehicles
to
deliver
a
bomb
someplace
or
they
could
be
used
to
put
a
bomb
into
orbit
to
be
delivered
later
he
leaned
back
am
i
right
or
not
her
eyes
darkened
and
she
suddenly
found
herself
sorry
she
had
ever
come
back
to
greece
for
this
then
she
caught
herself
and
answered
him
i
suppose
either
one
is
possible
the
reentry
trajectory
is
precisely
controlled
in
fact
we
power
it
down
more
or
less
like
the
space
shuttle
and
the
whole
thing
can
be
done
within
an
hour
or
so
right
that
is
once
it
in
orbit
a
insertion
means
a
full
orbit
of
about
ninety
minutes
for
a
satellite
she
was
thinking
if
the
vehicle
itself
stays
in
orbit
then
everything
would
still
be
controlled
from
down
here
correct
we
beam
power
up
to
the
vehicle
using
the
cyclops
that
the
whole
idea
she
was
thinking
what
you
saying
is
once
they
get
a
vehicle
and
a
bomb
into
orbit
they
got
a
loaded
gun
pointed
at
any
place
they
choose
does
that
sound
like
the
scenario
they
never
pull
it
off
it
was
more
a
hope
than
a
statement
of
fact
how
are
you
going
to
stop
them
if
ramirez
thinks
you
not
cooperating
then
all
he
has
to
do
is
start
killing
more
of
your
staff
until
you
do
he
looked
down
the
hill
where
the
facility
was
now
dark
except
for
the
yellow
sodium
lights
around
the
storage
sheds
and
the
blaze
of
floods
that
illuminated
the
two
vehicles
but
i
definitely
think
they
going
to
try
some
kind
of
launch
you
said
they
being
very
careful
not
to
disturb
anything
so
what
are
the
possibilities
the
easiest
thing
would
be
not
to
bother
putting
it
into
orbit
at
all
she
answered
after
a
moment
in
fact
number
one
or
sabri
ramirez
or
whoever
he
is
had
georges
running
some
trajectory
aborts
it
all
fits
also
you
got
two
vehicles
and
that
box
had
enough
detonators
for
several
bombs
so
say
they
had
two
nuclear
devices
they
use
the
first
one
as
a
small
demo
to
prove
they
serious
sort
of
like
we
did
on
hiroshima
and
hold
the
second
one
in
reserve
for
more
blackmail
he
reached
up
and
touched
the
bark
of
the
tree
above
but
any
way
you
look
at
it
they
seem
to
be
dead
serious
about
delivering
a
nuke
somewhere
where
you
know
there
a
base
not
far
from
here
souda
bay
it
on
crete
so
close
they
probably
could
miss
he
thought
about
it
taking
out
that
base
could
decimate
the
sixth
fleet
it
would
be
a
very
demonstration
think
they
could
really
do
it
crete
would
just
be
a
short
hop
for
it
easy
and
it
a
nightmare
sounds
pretty
good
for
he
pointed
down
moving
through
the
shadows
at
the
far
edge
of
the
facility
past
the
bright
circles
cast
by
the
sodium
lights
was
a
group
of
black
figures
guess
it
had
to
happen
but
i
still
finishing
the
analysis
i
was
supposed
to
do
lefarge
said
to
dore
peretz
hoping
he
could
stall
i
only
half
i
telling
you
to
abort
those
runs
the
truth
peretz
reflected
was
that
ramirez
had
jumped
the
gun
on
the
trajectory
analysis
maybe
he
just
wanted
to
keep
this
computer
jockey
busy
or
maybe
he
understand
the
technical
side
of
things
well
enough
in
any
case
it
had
to
be
redone
since
the
crucial
payload
parameters
were
going
to
be
new
a
substantial
weight
differential
that
would
impact
the
power
input
controls
kill
what
you
doing
and
let
me
see
what
you
got
so
far
if
you
on
the
right
track
then
we
do
a
quick
rerun
with
revised
numbers
lefarge
grimaced
then
turned
back
to
the
keyboard
and
gave
the
order
to
abort
directing
the
output
to
the
battery
of
printers
the
quiet
hum
of
zipping
lasers
began
barely
audible
above
the
ambient
noise
of
the
room
when
the
first
printer
finished
peretz
ripped
out
the
stack
of
paper
and
began
looking
it
over
all
right
he
nodded
with
satisfaction
this
is
enough
the
power
inputs
he
pointed
right
here
will
need
to
be
reentered
to
conform
to
the
altered
weight
coefficients
of
the
new
payload
i
have
to
get
them
he
turned
away
and
clicked
on
his
black
kenwood
moments
later
he
was
asking
somebody
some
technical
questions
he
then
waited
humming
to
himself
while
the
answers
were
procured
finally
he
nodded
and
jotted
them
down
on
the
bottom
of
the
printout
got
it
you
right
okay
he
clicked
off
the
handset
and
looked
up
all
fixed
he
walked
back
and
laid
down
the
paper
on
lefarge
desk
okay
start
over
and
run
it
with
these
georges
looked
at
the
numbers
the
new
payload
was
kilograms
there
it
was
what
now
he
knew
the
answer
he
had
no
choice
but
to
give
peretz
what
he
wanted
he
had
planned
to
make
some
changes
in
sort
that
would
screw
up
the
whole
launch
routine
but
now
with
the
israeli
looking
over
his
shoulder
that
was
going
to
be
impossible
this
creep
knew
exactly
how
the
program
worked
he
probably
could
spot
any
changes
a
mile
away
cally
cally
where
are
you
are
you
okay
are
you
getting
help
let
me
know
where
you
are
at
least
i
ca
stop
these
guys
all
by
myself
he
sighed
tugged
at
his
wisp
of
beard
and
called
up
the
data
input
file
for
sort
then
he
began
inserting
the
new
parameters
around
command
the
other
staffers
were
perfunctorily
carrying
out
housekeeping
chores
at
their
workstations
the
routine
checks
and
runs
they
did
every
day
lefarge
suspected
the
stakes
had
just
been
raised
but
he
had
no
idea
what
they
were
she
looked
down
where
i
do
see
anything
over
there
by
the
side
of
the
sheds
there
a
saying
in
the
darkness
only
the
shadows
move
see
them
he
rose
and
looked
around
guess
we
better
start
thinking
up
a
plan
here
although
trees
shielded
the
base
of
the
mountain
the
top
had
been
cleared
and
flattened
to
accommodate
the
battery
of
antennas
the
only
possible
protection
was
a
low
cinderblock
structure
on
the
side
nearest
the
facility
you
right
she
said
finally
squinting
i
do
think
i
see
something
yes
they
look
like
they
headed
our
way
toward
the
trees
and
then
right
up
the
hill
oh
shit
the
sight
made
something
click
in
her
head
and
her
fear
turned
again
to
anger
terrorists
she
knew
always
planned
to
wear
down
their
captives
make
them
pliable
she
was
going
to
let
it
happen
looks
like
three
or
maybe
four
who
needed
this
he
sighed
to
himself
i
think
i
see
something
else
they
carrying
something
with
them
and
i
do
like
the
looks
of
what
i
think
it
is
as
he
stared
down
he
was
wondering
how
would
they
choose
to
try
and
take
the
mountain
a
direct
assault
a
pronged
pincer
or
would
they
use
some
other
technique
and
what
were
they
carrying
some
of
the
hardware
they
brought
in
the
hind
at
least
we
got
the
high
ground
he
continued
finally
trying
to
think
through
the
odds
let
hope
that
counts
for
something
mostly
open
so
we
can
see
them
then
he
reflected
on
the
downside
but
they
can
see
us
if
we
make
a
run
for
the
top
of
the
hill
it
too
far
so
there
not
much
we
can
do
except
just
wait
the
one
little
uzi
is
going
to
do
much
good
let
think
a
minute
she
said
turning
and
looking
up
the
hill
about
to
pass
through
the
trees
down
there
which
should
give
us
enough
time
to
get
to
the
blockhouse
she
pointed
there
at
the
dark
crest
was
the
cinderblock
emplacement
that
housed
the
operation
controls
for
the
radars
let
go
up
there
i
just
had
an
idea
i
game
he
nodded
feeling
his
adrenaline
starting
to
build
again
standing
here
is
not
going
to
do
anything
for
us
it
was
a
quick
climb
through
the
slivers
of
granite
outcropping
that
cut
their
way
out
of
the
shallow
soil
when
they
reached
the
cinderblock
structure
she
punched
in
a
security
code
on
the
keypad
beside
its
black
steel
door
and
shoved
it
open
if
they
have
shut
down
the
terminal
in
here
yet
maybe
i
can
get
georges
on
the
computer
net
he
can
shunt
over
control
of
those
servomechanisms
up
there
and
then
he
followed
her
inside
as
he
did
fluorescent
lights
clicked
on
to
reveal
an
array
of
radar
screens
and
a
main
computer
terminal
hey
can
we
kill
the
beacon
he
frowned
whatever
you
planning
better
be
doable
in
the
dark
no
problem
she
activated
the
terminal
then
pointed
toward
the
door
the
light
switch
is
right
there
think
you
can
handle
it
he
clicked
it
off
and
let
the
wisecrack
pass
then
he
turned
back
now
what
god
i
never
had
anybody
coming
to
kill
me
the
stories
are
right
it
really
does
concentrate
the
mind
she
began
typing
on
the
keyboard
i
had
a
thought
we
networked
into
the
fujitsu
from
all
over
the
facility
with
lan
so
and
that
computer
lingo
for
a
network
or
something
right
she
nodded
at
one
point
we
had
to
hook
all
the
workstations
together
for
a
special
test
part
of
this
area
was
connected
into
the
network
so
we
could
do
some
of
the
work
from
up
here
but
we
always
kept
the
larger
servomechanisms
on
the
main
system
for
safety
reasons
georges
set
it
all
up
so
everything
has
to
be
operated
from
down
there
where
the
power
drain
can
be
monitored
right
now
i
need
to
get
hold
of
him
and
have
him
do
some
things
she
was
still
typing
and
then
she
got
what
she
wanted
hello
soho
bluebird
needs
a
favor
can
you
switch
on
the
servos
lefarge
stared
at
the
screen
not
believing
his
eyes
cally
was
on
the
lan
a
window
had
appeared
at
the
lower
hand
of
his
screen
and
her
terminal
id
was
terrific
it
was
the
blockhouse
up
the
hill
he
slipped
a
glance
at
peretz
standing
over
by
the
water
cooler
then
quickly
typed
in
an
acknowledgment
soho
never
lets
bluebird
down
then
came
the
specific
directions
she
was
asking
him
to
switch
control
of
the
servos
for
radar
one
over
to
her
terminal
what
was
she
doing
the
radars
were
always
controlled
by
big
benny
the
fujitsu
here
in
command
he
grimaced
switching
the
big
radar
over
to
her
workstation
was
a
tall
order
and
the
israeli
bastard
was
waiting
for
his
sort
run
so
now
the
trick
was
to
try
to
do
both
things
at
once
he
split
the
screen
and
went
to
work
georges
is
a
genius
she
said
turning
back
but
this
may
not
actually
be
possible
nobody
ever
done
it
before
whatever
you
planning
had
better
be
possible
or
we
got
to
begin
thinking
up
a
plan
b
and
quick
he
was
staring
out
the
open
door
because
our
new
friends
are
definitely
on
their
way
and
ready
for
a
close
encounter
georges
has
got
to
hook
this
terminal
directly
to
the
fujitsu
which
is
how
we
normally
use
it
and
then
give
me
control
of
the
routine
that
runs
the
servos
in
effect
he
has
to
put
them
on
manual
do
think
you
going
to
manage
it
in
time
he
said
he
was
thinking
this
was
no
time
to
get
experimental
but
he
decided
to
keep
the
thought
to
himself
instead
he
nervously
checked
the
uzi
three
rounds
were
left
in
the
last
remaining
clip
he
regretted
all
the
random
firing
he
had
done
over
the
last
few
hours
now
every
round
had
to
be
hoarded
as
though
it
were
the
last
on
the
other
hand
maybe
he
was
lucky
just
to
have
the
damned
uzi
at
all
along
with
the
few
puny
rounds
left
the
trick
now
was
to
try
not
to
have
to
use
them
down
below
them
the
four
black
figures
had
already
moved
past
the
helicopter
landing
pad
and
were
about
to
be
swallowed
up
in
the
copse
of
trees
that
began
at
the
base
of
the
hill
but
now
a
sliver
of
moon
had
appeared
from
behind
a
bank
of
clouds
in
the
east
casting
an
eerie
pale
glow
onto
the
scene
he
found
himself
deeply
wishing
for
an
ir
scope
which
would
be
a
great
help
bring
them
right
up
i
just
lost
them
in
the
trees
he
said
turning
back
which
means
we
got
about
five
minutes
left
for
whatever
you
got
in
mind
trust
me
she
was
still
typing
workstation
just
logged
onto
the
big
system
so
the
main
servo
program
is
now
accessible
from
here
georges
i
love
you
now
all
i
have
to
do
is
try
and
override
the
internal
checks
that
go
through
the
fujitsu
down
in
command
vance
was
staring
not
quite
sure
what
he
was
expected
to
say
then
what
hopefully
it
a
surprise
she
laughed
a
trifle
grimly
just
be
quiet
and
let
me
work
then
her
voice
swelled
with
nger
the
bastards
this
is
going
to
be
a
pleasure
after
what
they
did
to
chris
maybe
i
get
to
return
the
favor
vance
started
to
say
something
but
stopped
when
he
noticed
the
first
signs
of
motion
at
the
edge
of
the
copse
of
brush
the
killers
were
emerging
and
the
sight
gave
him
a
chill
they
the
hunters
and
the
quarry
he
thought
it
going
to
be
like
a
giant
played
with
automatics
you
know
he
turned
back
here
still
time
for
you
to
give
yourself
up
they
probably
rather
have
you
live
anyway
you
could
do
the
thing
and
i
could
use
the
confusion
to
try
and
make
it
into
the
brush
down
here
toward
the
shore
those
guys
are
carrying
something
that
looks
suspiciously
like
heavy
weaponry
but
that
a
riddle
we
do
want
to
solve
empirically
look
trust
me
she
shot
back
i
know
what
i
doing
i
think
do
you
have
any
faith
we
may
not
know
each
other
well
enough
to
be
having
his
conversation
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
exactly
right
she
hurriedly
finished
typing
okay
georges
has
the
control
set
up
now
and
we
on
line
hang
on
she
reached
down
to
flip
a
large
red
switch
on
the
side
of
he
console
immediately
one
of
the
large
green
tubes
began
to
glow
what
it
showed
however
was
not
the
usual
sweeping
line
going
round
and
round
instead
it
dismayed
the
crisp
outline
of
the
space
vehicle
at
the
other
end
of
the
island
next
she
flipped
another
switch
then
reached
for
a
mouse
that
was
connected
to
the
keyboard
she
zipped
it
across
and
the
focus
of
the
radar
picture
changed
almost
as
though
it
were
a
zoom
lens
the
image
of
the
vehicle
became
larger
and
smaller
he
realized
the
radar
could
be
focused
then
she
called
in
another
routine
i
going
to
cut
the
power
for
a
second
take
it
down
cross
the
facility
and
onto
the
base
of
the
mountain
and
then
i
power
up
again
he
watched
as
the
outline
of
the
island
in
exquisite
detail
swept
over
the
screen
i
thought
this
thing
was
only
for
transmission
how
can
it
be
sending
back
images
there
the
section
for
powering
the
vehicle
with
microwaves
that
part
of
the
cyclops
but
we
also
have
to
have
a
guidance
section
for
keeping
the
beam
on
track
the
cyclops
is
the
gun
but
the
guidance
radar
here
is
what
we
use
to
aim
it
she
was
concentrating
on
the
screen
now
where
do
you
think
our
friends
are
down
there
probably
halfway
up
the
hill
by
now
let
take
a
look
she
brought
down
the
focus
then
began
scanning
hold
on
he
stayed
her
hand
bringing
the
mouse
to
halt
and
then
pointing
to
the
lower
left
corner
of
the
large
screen
something
move
just
then
right
there
where
there
he
took
the
mouse
and
guided
the
image
to
center
screen
where
is
that
in
the
real
world
it
got
to
be
close
she
zipped
the
mouse
again
bringing
up
the
detail
a
number
scrolled
at
the
bottom
of
the
screen
four
hundred
meters
to
be
exact
as
moreau
emerged
from
the
last
copse
of
cypress
he
scanned
the
mountain
towering
upward
in
the
moonlit
night
and
wondered
where
the
bastard
would
be
holed
up
there
was
one
obvious
place
in
the
cinderblock
control
house
yeah
ten
to
one
that
where
he
had
to
be
the
guy
was
stupid
riding
a
lucky
streak
it
was
over
on
the
other
hand
he
thought
there
no
reason
not
to
take
this
slow
just
in
case
the
fucker
was
stupid
he
looked
down
as
a
limb
of
thorny
bramble
caught
his
black
trousers
tearing
a
hole
near
the
knee
fiche
although
he
lived
by
terrorism
was
a
confirmed
denizen
of
paris
and
he
had
little
use
for
roughing
it
here
on
this
godforsaken
island
in
the
bowels
of
the
aegean
who
needed
it
on
the
other
hand
tonight
expedition
promised
some
diversion
it
was
always
a
pleasure
to
take
out
some
jerk
who
was
specializing
in
making
a
bloody
nuisance
of
himself
if
he
could
assassinate
the
chairman
of
renault
he
figured
he
could
handle
this
asshole
guard
moreau
had
brought
along
stelios
tritsis
reasoning
that
a
native
greek
could
best
guide
them
up
this
rugged
mountain
but
he
also
had
helling
two
stasi
a
lousy
idea
it
had
been
to
include
them
in
the
first
place
ramirez
had
lost
sight
of
his
better
judgment
he
looked
back
to
check
them
over
they
were
carrying
he
as
ordered
but
he
doubted
they
had
the
slightest
idea
how
it
was
fired
though
possibly
they
were
teachable
retardates
he
revolved
and
stared
up
the
mountain
wondering
whether
the
blockhouse
contained
any
technical
apparatus
that
he
had
to
be
wary
of
maybe
he
thought
i
better
just
use
a
stun
grenade
what
was
that
he
checked
through
the
ir
scope
of
his
kalashnikov
just
to
be
sure
one
of
the
giant
radar
dishes
was
turning
what
in
hell
did
that
mean
then
he
caught
a
flicker
of
light
from
the
blockhouse
so
he
bastard
was
in
there
but
was
he
trying
to
pull
something
okay
time
to
get
serious
the
place
is
well
away
from
the
radars
and
antennas
so
just
send
a
stun
grenade
through
the
door
and
take
out
the
fucker
eardrums
no
frags
no
muss
no
fuss
then
clean
up
the
place
at
leisure
he
motioned
for
schindler
and
maier
to
bring
up
the
launcher
what
are
you
doing
peretz
asked
he
sensed
the
lad
at
he
terminal
was
up
to
something
because
he
split
the
screen
and
was
typing
in
a
second
batch
of
commands
on
the
lower
half
cc
to
ian
just
some
systems
cleanup
lefarge
tried
to
lie
as
convincingly
as
he
knew
how
expn
to
jrad
better
not
try
to
bullshit
me
pal
it
could
be
very
unhealthy
lefarge
was
already
aware
of
that
but
he
kept
on
typing
trying
to
look
as
casual
as
he
could
almost
almost
there
the
bastard
is
in
the
blockhouse
there
moreau
motioned
for
the
first
german
stasi
schindler
but
get
a
move
on
he
may
be
up
to
something
with
moreau
directing
them
they
quickly
slipped
the
two
sections
of
the
launcher
together
to
form
a
single
tube
approximately
a
meter
and
a
half
in
length
the
rocket
grenade
on
the
forward
end
looked
like
a
round
arrowhead
while
the
back
was
flared
to
dissipate
the
exhaust
gases
the
sight
and
rangefinder
occupied
the
center
and
just
in
front
of
that
was
the
handgrip
and
trigger
when
they
had
finished
he
checked
it
over
then
surveyed
the
mountain
where
the
heavy
servomechanisms
controlling
the
radars
continued
to
rotate
wait
a
minute
he
told
himself
with
a
sudden
chill
in
his
groin
something
wrong
he
tilting
the
radar
dishes
dieu
get
ready
we
just
ran
out
of
time
vance
said
slamming
the
door
shut
looks
like
they
got
a
grenade
launcher
if
they
can
manage
to
blast
through
this
door
it
going
to
ruin
our
day
once
and
for
all
georges
is
still
and
i
turning
the
servos
as
fast
as
i
can
her
voice
betrayed
the
strain
well
get
on
with
it
they
setting
up
to
fire
i
guess
you
got
about
thirty
seconds
to
pull
off
this
miracle
of
yours
i
think
a
hundred
and
sixty
degrees
will
do
it
she
said
her
voice
now
deceptively
mechanical
all
business
suddenly
he
could
envision
her
running
this
facility
and
barking
orders
right
and
left
we
at
now
i
just
do
know
if
i
can
focus
it
in
time
georges
always
handled
this
she
was
tapping
on
the
keyboard
some
message
to
lefarge
a
cryptic
reply
appeared
on
the
screen
next
to
what
appeared
to
vance
to
be
computer
garbage
then
the
motion
of
the
giant
servomechanisms
seemed
to
pick
up
speed
the
radar
antennas
were
swiveling
around
and
down
we
almost
ready
let
me
get
georges
to
transfer
the
power
controls
to
full
manual
christ
he
cocked
his
uzi
look
she
exploded
i
doing
my
part
how
about
you
doing
yours
slow
them
down
i
do
want
to
waste
any
rounds
until
it
absolutely
necessary
but
it
looked
like
that
time
had
come
he
opened
the
door
again
and
stepped
through
down
below
the
moon
glistened
on
the
rocks
and
one
of
the
gunmen
was
aiming
a
grenade
launcher
how
long
just
a
couple
more
seconds
now
it
now
or
never
he
took
careful
aim
on
the
man
holding
the
launcher
i
going
to
count
to
five
that
was
when
he
heard
her
say
got
it
all
right
moreau
barked
fire
on
three
schindler
had
just
finished
the
crosshairs
the
rangefinder
portion
of
the
complex
optical
sight
with
inflight
stability
for
the
rocket
provided
by
tail
fins
that
folded
out
after
launch
the
had
a
range
against
static
targets
though
a
crosswind
could
affect
the
accuracy
tonight
thankfully
there
was
none
this
one
could
miss
if
there
was
a
sudden
gust
he
tested
the
trigger
confidently
sights
on
the
open
doorway
and
hoped
moreau
was
right
when
he
claimed
the
concussion
grenade
would
render
anybody
inside
totally
incapacitated
his
eyes
on
the
target
he
failed
to
notice
a
flashing
green
light
that
had
just
clicked
on
next
to
the
main
antenna
up
above
atop
the
mountain
when
jet
fighters
are
launched
from
carriers
it
is
standard
practice
to
turn
off
an
aircraft
radars
until
the
planes
are
airborne
the
reason
being
that
the
energy
in
the
intense
electromagnetic
radiation
can
literally
knock
a
man
flat
with
an
invisible
wave
memorable
things
happened
to
the
eyes
and
ears
in
this
case
however
the
radar
could
have
no
such
total
effect
since
the
random
clumps
of
trees
down
the
hill
scattered
and
diffused
the
energy
it
was
however
one
of
the
most
powerful
radars
on
earth
vance
watched
as
something
hit
the
men
below
something
that
seemed
like
a
giant
invisible
mallet
they
stumbled
backward
while
a
grenade
rocketed
harmlessly
into
the
night
sky
congratulations
he
lowered
his
uzi
i
impressed
i
think
our
new
friends
down
there
are
too
yep
you
made
a
very
definite
impression
now
how
about
leaving
that
thing
on
long
enough
for
us
to
get
out
of
here
and
back
up
the
hill
maybe
just
fry
the
bastards
for
a
while
how
does
eight
minutes
sound
to
you
should
be
time
enough
for
us
to
scurry
back
down
the
rabbit
hole
maybe
take
a
moonlight
swim
in
a
tunnel
he
was
liking
her
more
and
more
all
the
time
not
a
bad
piece
of
work
i
tell
georges
to
cut
the
power
in
eight
she
said
then
she
added
look
why
do
we
head
for
the
hotel
you
look
bushed
you
mean
go
down
to
the
bates
motel
i
being
invited
to
a
motel
by
this
woman
he
smiled
i
must
be
dreaming
we
can
cut
around
by
the
shore
that
probably
the
last
place
anybody
is
going
to
look
for
us
now
sounds
good
it
did
he
was
dead
tired
and
hungry
tomorrow
was
going
to
be
a
long
long
day
the
other
reason
i
want
to
go
down
is
to
try
and
find
isaac
she
added
the
professor
well
he
only
seems
that
way
behind
all
those
eccentricities
is
a
mind
you
would
believe
but
whatever
we
find
i
think
we
both
need
to
knock
off
for
a
while
and
get
recharged
let
give
it
a
try
i
think
everybody
brain
and
nerves
could
use
a
breather
i
know
mine
could
we
out
of
here
she

the

by
major

eric
nichols
a

veteran
of

who
holds

he
is

ten
with

and
an
old
scar
down
his

he
also
moves
with
the
deftness
of
a
large
cat
like
his
picked
men
he
is
highly
intelligent
physically
honed
to
perfection
and
possessed
of
a
powerful
survival
instinct
his
only
weakness
is
a
taste
for
cuban

which
he
satisfies
with
montecristos
smuggled
to
him
by

forces
on
the

acquaintances
whose
identity
no
conceivable
amount
of
torture
could
extract
when
nichols
breached
the
open
doorway
of
the
new
officers
lounge
those
in
attendance
were
deep
in
a
cosmic
game
of
stud
with
two
lieutenant
manny
jackson
and
captain
philip
sexton
particularly
engrossed
hoping
desperately
that
the
hand
they
now
had
in
play
would
somehow
miraculously
recoup
their
staggering
losses
for
the
evening
he
paused
a
moment
involuntarily
and
surveyed
the
men
feeling
a
surge
of
pride
as
always
in
the
way
they
carried
themselves
a
bearing
that
in
others
might
have
seemed
arrogance
on
them
only
affirmed
their
competent
and
why
not
usually
fewer
than
half
a
dozen
volunteers
finished
out
of
a
class
of
fifty
a
lightweight
like
chuck
norris
would
stand
a
chance
mostly
in
their
early
thirties
with
the
powerful
shoulders
of
bodybuilders
the
shooters
of
delta
force
did
not
resemble
service
types
for
one
thing
since
they
had
to
be
ready
for
a
clandestine
op
at
a
moment
notice
they
deliberately
looked
as
unmilitary
as
possible
right
down
to
their
shaggy
civilian
haircuts
although
they
wore
jumpsuits
during
daily
training
here
informally
off
the
ranch
it
was
sports
shirts
tattered
jeans
and
sneakers
naturally
he
noticed
the
poker
game
bending
the
regs
was
after
all
delta
force
modus
operandi
and
he
just
as
routinely
suppressed
a
smile
he
simply
would
see
it
but
with
the
monetary
stakes
he
counted
on
the
table
he
realized
that
his
news
could
not
have
come
at
a
worse
time
on
the
other
hand
legitimate
ops
were
few
and
far
between
and
they
were
always
eager
for
action
some
real
excitement
at
last
he
knew
every
man
in
the
trimmed
gray
room
would
feel
a
rush
of
adrenaline
he
took
a
deep
breath
and
broke
up
the
party
heads
up
you
it
was
his
everyday
formal
greeting
bad
news
and
good
news
report
to
the
briefing
room
at
hours
with
all
personal
gear
be
ready
to
ship
there
was
a
scramble
to
salute
followed
by
a
frenzied
bustle
to
collect
the
money
still
lying
on
the
table
in
seconds
everybody
was
reaching
for
his
jacket
they
had
only
fifteen
minutes
but
they
were
always
packed
the
briefing
room
was
a
windowless
space
next
to
the
ranch
new
headquarters
building
it
contained
a
long
metal
table
in
the
center
blackboards
and
maps
around
the
walls
and
the
far
end
was
chockablock
with
video
screens
and
electronic
gear
as
the
unit
members
filed
in
they
noticed
that
maps
of
the
eastern
mediterranean
now
plastered
the
wall
next
to
these
they
saw
blowups
of
photos
of
a
small
island
identified
only
by
latitude
and
longitude
coordinates
all
right
listen
up
nichols
began
almost
the
instant
they
had
settled
he
had
just
fired
up
a
cuban
montecristo
and
was
still
trying
to
get
it
stoked
to
his
satisfaction
i
picked
three
men
i
read
off
the
list
and
if
you
do
hear
your
name
you
dismissed
he
read
the
list
watched
much
of
the
room
clear
and
then
continued
okay
you
god
chosen
i
picked
the
guys
i
happen
to
think
are
best
suited
to
the
way
i
see
the
op
shaping
up
to
begin
with
going
to
be
airborne
by
hours
which
a
check
of
your
watches
will
inform
you
is
less
than
an
hour
away
which
means
no
bullshit
between
now
and
when
we
ship
out
we
be
flying
bess
everybody
favorite
with
two
refuelings
destination
officially
classified
but
if
you
guessed
souda
bay
i
have
to
say
comment
wherever
it
is
we
going
we
scheduled
in
at
hours
local
tomorrow
for
now
i
want
to
go
over
the
general
outlines
of
the
op
there
be
a
detailed
briefing
after
we
land
in
the
meantime
i
put
together
a
packet
of
maps
and
materials
for
everybody
to
study
on
the
plane
i
suggest
you
hone
your
reading
skills
now
here
what
i
authorized
to
tell
you
they
listened
intently
and
without
interruption
as
he
proceeded
to
give
a
rundown
they
would
be
making
a
scuba
insertion
onto
a
greek
island
operational
maps
with
the
general
geography
were
in
the
packet
where
an
unknown
number
of
hostiles
had
seized
an
american
industrial
facility
and
were
holding
hostages
he
then
provided
a
rough
description
of
the
satcom
facility
using
satellite
maps
they
would
rehearse
the
insertion
at
an
appropriate
location
in
the
vicinity
and
then
chopper
to
a
carrier
some
twenty
klicks
south
of
the
island
where
they
would
undergo
their
final
prep
it
was
a
thorough
if
circumspect
briefing
which
was
what
they
expected
since
its
inception
delta
had
always
operated
on
a
security
basis
information
always
came
as
late
into
an
operation
as
possible
on
the
theory
that
it
was
a
sword
and
lives
were
at
stake
frequently
the
command
did
not
divulge
the
real
background
and
strategic
purpose
of
an
op
until
after
its
conclusion
thereby
avoiding
sending
in
men
with
extractable
information
questions
right
away
they
all
had
plenty
what
was
the
layout
of
the
facility
on
the
island
how
many
hostiles
were
there
how
were
they
equipped
what
was
the
disposition
of
the
hostages
how
many
was
their
objective
merely
to
extract
the
friendlies
or
were
they
also
ordered
to
neutralize
all
the
hostiles
answer
you
get
a
further
briefing
at
the
appropriate
time
the
biggest
question
of
all
however
was
why
the
urgency
why
was
delta
being
called
in
to
take
down
a
situation
that
had
no
military
dimensions
where
were
the
civilian
swat
teams
if
this
was
merely
an
industrial
matter
why
was
somebody
negotiating
they
knew
bess
was
already
being
loaded
with
the
gear
the
brass
would
think
they
would
need
in
addition
however
each
man
had
certain
nonissue
items
something
to
take
along
as
a
talisman
for
luck
a
backup
handgun
strapped
onto
the
ankle
an
extra
knife
carrying
such
paraphernalia
was
against
the
regs
of
course
but
major
general
nichols
always
took
such
niceties
in
stride
if
the
job
got
done
he
had
selective
blind
spots
as
far
as
such
things
were
concerned
nichols
actually
knew
a
lot
more
than
he
had
told
his
men
he
had
already
planned
the
op
in
his
head
for
the
insertion
backup
would
be
provided
by
two
apaches
that
would
be
armed
and
ready
to
carry
out
a
rocket
attack
on
the
facility
radars
and
the
two
launch
vehicles
once
they
had
secured
the
hostages
they
were
going
to
treat
the
terrorists
to
a
goddamn
big
surprise
there
would
be
no
place
to
hide
if
he
had
to
he
was
prepared
to
blow
the
place
to
hell
let
the
insurance
companies
worry
about
it
the
electric
sign
meeting
in
progress
over
the
door
to
the
situation
room
had
been
illuminated
for
hours
inside
hansen
sat
in
a
tall
swivel
chair
at
one
end
of
a
long
table
staring
at
a
detailed
map
of
the
eastern
mediterranean
now
being
projected
on
the
giant
screen
at
the
end
of
the
room
in
the
subdued
recessed
lighting
cups
of
cold
coffee
stood
around
the
central
teakwood
table
a
fourth
pot
was
already
brewing
in
the
kitchenette
while
the
rotund
chairman
of
the
joint
chiefs
edward
briggs
had
resorted
to
doing
knee
bends
to
stay
alert
all
right
hansen
was
saying
we
got
the
special
forces
in
the
game
that
gives
us
a
military
option
but
i
wondering
maybe
we
should
just
go
ahead
and
evacuate
souda
at
the
minimum
get
the
sixth
fleet
out
of
there
as
a
safety
precaution
we
could
manufacture
some
exercise
that
would
at
least
get
most
of
our
assets
clear
if
the
bastards
had
a
nuke
he
was
thinking
a
hit
could
make
pearl
harbor
look
like
a
minor
skirmish
right
now
the
entire
complement
of
carriers
in
the
mediterranean
was
there
not
to
mention
destroyers
frigates
and
a
classified
number
of
aircraft
the
destruction
would
run
in
the
untold
billions
the
loss
of
life
would
be
incalculable
where
would
we
deploy
them
briggs
rose
bent
over
one
last
time
to
stretch
his
muscles
then
straightened
assuming
we
could
get
them
clear
within
hours
which
would
be
pushing
our
luck
have
to
figure
out
what
to
do
next
well
assuming
there
available
draft
we
could
deploy
some
of
them
around
the
island
we
give
those
bastards
who
hijacked
the
place
a
little
something
to
occupy
their
minds
might
make
them
think
long
and
hard
about
getting
back
to
beirut
or
wherever
the
hell
they
came
from
you
talking
about
a
tall
order
i
do
think
we
could
really
mobilize
and
evacuate
the
base
in
that
kind
of
time
frame
and
even
if
we
could
our
operations
in
the
med
would
be
disrupted
to
the
point
it
would
take
us
months
to
recover
well
ed
the
president
snapped
those
are
the
kinds
of
problems
you
supposedly
being
paid
to
solve
if
we
not
mobile
then
what
the
hell
are
we
doing
in
the
med
in
the
first
place
the
question
was
rhetorical
but
it
stung
as
intended
i
see
if
i
can
get
a
scenario
ready
for
you
by
hours
tomorrow
he
tried
not
to
squirm
they
both
knew
he
had
already
cut
the
orders
deploying
fort
bragg
special
forces
to
souda
to
be
ready
in
case
an
assault
was
needed
the
last
resort
in
the
meantime
i
certainly
could
arrange
for
the
base
to
go
on
a
practice
alert
cancel
all
leave
and
get
everybody
on
a
basis
i
think
you
should
do
that
at
the
very
least
should
i
inform
the
greek
government
hansen
wondered
again
no
let
see
if
this
can
be
handled
without
opening
a
can
of
worms
about
whose
sovereign
rights
are
uppermost
here
the
relationship
with
greece
had
for
all
its
ups
and
downs
been
generally
cordial
with
any
luck
they
would
never
have
to
be
involved
or
with
supreme
good
fortune
even
know
then
have
alicia
get
johnson
over
at
the
pentagon
on
the
line
briggs
said
and
he
can
cut
the
orders
we
never
moved
this
fast
before
so
we
about
to
find
out
where
our
glitches
are
do
be
surprised
if
there
are
plenty
just
be
happy
if
the
american
taxpayer
never
finds
out
what
getting
for
his
money
the
president
responded
and
speaking
of
money
we
been
faxed
a
string
of
account
numbers
for
a
bank
in
geneva
this
is
going
to
have
to
come
out
of
a
budget
somewhere
so
who
do
i
stiff
to
pay
off
these
bastards
or
make
them
temporarily
think
i
paying
them
off
it
got
to
be
some
discretionary
fund
that
has
minimal
accountability
and
i
do
want
the
cia
within
a
mile
of
this
that
place
is
like
a
sieve
briggs
pondered
i
can
probably
come
up
with
the
money
by
juggling
some
of
the
active
accounts
in
procurement
cash
flow
is
a
marvelous
thing
if
it
handled
right
you
can
rob
peter
to
pay
paul
and
then
make
peter
whole
by
robbing
somebody
else
then
the
end
of
the
fiscal
year
comes
around
and
you
withhold
payment
from
some
contractor
while
you
hold
an
he
smiled
believe
me
there
are
ways
the
president
was
smiling
do
tell
me
i
do
think
i
want
to
hear
this
but
if
you
going
to
play
bingo
with
the
books
then
damned
well
better
do
it
quick
and
on
the
qt
that
be
the
easiest
part
i
already
got
some
ideas
just
make
sure
i
do
end
up
with
another
brouhaha
on
my
neck
i
wo
be
able
to
plead
senility
and
let
a
few
fall
guys
take
the
rap
briggs
had
foreseen
as
well
the
glare
of
television
lights
in
the
senate
hearing
room
worse
still
it
did
not
take
too
challenging
a
flight
of
imagination
to
figure
out
who
would
end
up
being
the
patsy
he
would
have
to
fall
on
his
sword
to
protect
the
presidency
washington
had
a
grand
tradition
of
that
he
could
kiss
to
a
comfortable
retirement
in
arizona
next
to
a
golf
link
you
can
be
sure
i
will
take
the
utmost
care
mr
president
and
he
was
smiling
even
though
hansen
was
not
all
right
now
about
the
special
forces
once
we
get
them
to
souda
bay
i
want
a
quick
rehearsal
and
then
i
want
them
deployed
just
offshore
on
the
kennedy
ready
to
move
which
means
that
whatever
support
they
need
has
to
be
ready
by
the
time
they
arrive
what
have
you
got
on
that
a
task
force
shipped
out
for
souda
tonight
president
their
is
already
in
the
air
the
problems
are
at
the
other
end
once
we
still
looking
at
a
prep
time
of
twelve
hours
minimum
there
just
no
way
they
can
mount
an
assault
any
sooner
than
that
the
president
winced
already
thinking
about
his
other
problem
if
they
did
have
a
nuclear
device
or
devices
whose
was
it
the
signs
all
pointed
in
one
direction
the
israelis
claimed
the
stolen
iranian
hind
had
stopped
over
in
pakistan
there
probably
was
no
need
to
look
any
further
but
now
he
needed
somehow
to
get
a
confirmation
or
was
the
threat
of
a
bomb
just
a
hoax
he
had
a
meeting
at
ten
in
the
morning
with
the
pakistani
ambassador
it
would
have
to
be
handled
delicately
with
a
lot
of
circumlocutions
and
diplomatic
niceties
but
he
damn
well
intended
to
get
some
plain
answers
so
this
is
the
bates
motel
i
heard
so
much
about
vance
said
casting
a
glance
down
the
dull
cinderblock
walls
hitchcock
version
had
a
lot
more
character
you
right
cally
agreed
but
wait
till
you
see
what
it
like
upstairs
it
sort
of
gives
new
meaning
to
the
phrase
no
frills
a
hell
of
a
place
to
cut
corners
given
all
the
money
bill
poured
into
this
facility
but
he
said
he
was
building
a
resort
she
gestured
around
the
utilities
room
where
a
maze
of
insulated
steam
and
pipes
crisscrossed
above
their
heads
like
a
huge
white
forest
anyway
welcome
back
to
the
slightly
unreal
real
world
maybe
what
we
need
is
less
reality
not
more
but
if
you
can
find
us
a
beer
i
think
i
could
start
getting
the
hang
of
the
place
let
just
try
not
to
bump
into
anybody
okay
my
feeling
is
that
if
we
stay
out
of
level
three
upstairs
we
be
all
right
that
got
to
be
where
they
holding
everybody
who
not
on
duty
locked
away
for
safekeeping
they
had
entered
level
one
via
a
trapdoor
in
the
stone
water
conduit
that
picked
up
waste
heat
from
the
environmental
control
unit
in
the
residential
quarters
around
them
now
was
silence
save
for
the
clicks
and
hums
of
motors
and
pumps
all
right
who
do
we
see
about
something
to
eat
he
had
just
finished
drinking
deeply
from
a
spigot
on
one
of
the
incoming
pipes
even
though
he
was
still
soaking
wet
from
the
trip
through
the
conduit
he
was
feeling
severely
dehydrated
and
the
water
tasted
delicious
as
though
it
had
come
from
a
well
deep
in
the
island
core
it
had
you
see
me
she
replied
we
going
to
head
straight
for
the
kitchen
there
got
to
be
something
edible
there
so
let
take
the
elevator
up
and
see
what
on
the
menu
i
think
today
was
supposed
to
be
calamari
i
settle
for
a
simple
american
if
you
got
one
in
the
freezer
the
more
american
the
better
i
sort
of
down
on
greece
at
the
moment
you
can
have
pretty
much
what
you
want
here
as
long
as
it
not
a
pizza
or
a
decent
hamburger
she
was
pushing
the
button
to
summon
the
elevator
the
lights
above
the
door
told
the
story
of
the
facility
three
levels
with
the
top
being
the
living
quarters
level
two
being
services
such
as
food
preparation
and
laundry
level
one
utilities
hit
two
she
said
as
the
bell
chimed
and
she
stepped
on
taking
one
last
glance
about
the
basement
the
elevator
whisked
them
up
quickly
then
opened
onto
another
empty
hallway
you
know
she
said
her
voice
virtually
a
whisper
this
corridor
is
almost
always
full
of
people
i
guess
they
really
do
have
everybody
confined
to
quarters
lucky
us
they
thorough
and
they
know
what
they
doing
they
that
when
he
noticed
the
line
of
explosives
that
had
been
placed
along
the
wall
next
to
the
elevator
neat
yellow
bars
of
semtex
wrapped
in
cellophane
the
first
was
wired
to
a
detonator
which
was
in
turn
connected
to
a
digital
timer
hello
take
a
look
he
nodded
down
guess
my
wild
hunch
was
right
they
not
planning
to
leave
any
witnesses
when
this
is
over
when
they
finished
they
just
pack
everybody
in
here
and
blow
up
the
place
nice
and
tidy
wo
even
interfere
with
the
computers
just
in
case
they
need
to
keep
them
running
for
a
while
after
they
leave
he
bent
down
and
examined
the
timer
now
scrolling
the
minutes
in
red
numbers
it
was
set
to
blow
in
just
over
hours
guess
we
just
got
the
inside
track
on
their
timetable
my
god
she
said
looking
at
the
device
as
though
it
were
a
cobra
ca
we
just
turn
it
off
sooner
or
later
we
better
but
it
still
got
plenty
of
time
left
on
it
his
voice
turned
slightly
wistful
tell
you
the
truth
i
rather
some
of
the
guys
from
arm
did
it
i
slightly
chicken
when
it
comes
to
operations
cut
the
wrong
wire
and
eternity
takes
on
a
whole
new
perspective
he
shrugged
also
there
a
chance
somehow
the
thing
a
little
too
obvious
sitting
out
here
in
plain
view
when
something
looks
too
easy
i
always
get
suspicious
maybe
for
no
reason
but
he
motioned
her
away
i
suggest
we
forget
about
that
for
now
and
focus
on
finding
a
steak
i
also
would
fling
a
hot
shower
back
in
your
face
that
only
on
level
three
it
may
have
to
wait
she
took
his
arm
come
on
i
do
like
being
around
bombs
even
if
they
have
timers
she
led
the
way
down
the
abandoned
corridor
its
lighting
fluorescent
and
its
floor
covered
with
gray
industrial
carpet
there
was
a
total
almost
palpable
silence
about
the
place
that
made
it
feel
all
the
more
eerie
and
abandoned
it
seemed
utterly
strange
and
alien
the
kitchen
is
in
here
she
said
pushing
open
a
large
steel
door
vance
stepped
in
and
surveyed
it
all
the
fixtures
needed
for
a
mess
that
served
several
hundred
people
three
meals
daily
in
fact
it
looked
as
though
the
evening
cleanup
operation
had
been
halted
in
dirty
pots
sat
cold
on
the
big
industrial
stoves
and
piles
of
vegetables
were
on
the
wide
aluminum
tables
the
storage
lockers
refrigerators
and
freezers
were
located
across
the
room
opposite
by
the
way
he
had
a
sudden
thought
place
must
have
tv
monitors
somewhere
am
i
right
every
other
place
here
does
well
you
right
and
you
wrong
it
does
but
they
on
the
blink
it
always
seemed
like
a
stupid
idea
anyway
almost
like
spying
and
then
one
day
somebody
just
cut
the
wires
probably
one
of
the
cooks
i
never
bothered
getting
them
fixed
i
just
could
think
of
any
good
reason
to
bother
well
for
once
laziness
paid
off
maybe
we
safe
here
for
a
while
he
had
opened
the
freezer
hello
lady
luck
has
decided
to
get
with
the
program
he
was
pulling
out
two
thick
steaks
care
to
join
me
those
are
there
for
bill
she
noted
then
laughed
i
still
rather
have
a
pizza
but
i
do
guess
he
mind
if
we
dip
into
his
private
stock
so
i
repeat
the
question
he
was
already
unwrapping
two
both
thick
yes
of
course
i
famished
she
shivered
and
i
also
would
mind
a
set
of
dry
clothes
maybe
one
of
these
will
warm
you
up
he
was
popping
the
steaks
into
a
gleaming
white
microwave
for
a
quick
thaw
right
and
while
dinner
is
coming
along
how
about
drawing
me
a
diagram
of
what
up
there
maybe
we
can
go
up
later
take
a
look
around
let
eat
first
i
too
wired
to
think
she
switched
on
one
of
the
large
black
electric
grills
my
vote
is
that
we
just
sit
tight
for
now
and
why
not
this
man
with
the
sexy
eyes
and
healthy
laugh
attracted
her
mercurial
in
his
spirits
he
appeared
willing
to
take
chances
just
the
way
she
remembered
her
father
and
alan
but
she
wondered
why
he
was
here
risking
his
life
for
a
bunch
of
total
strangers
even
alan
would
have
done
that
you
know
mike
vance
i
have
to
tell
you
you
do
look
much
like
a
commando
guess
what
i
not
you
know
what
i
mean
for
that
matter
you
do
look
like
the
guys
who
came
and
installed
our
wonderful
security
system
i
like
to
know
your
real
story
how
are
retired
archaeologists
supposed
to
look
but
i
was
good
enough
at
it
or
maybe
i
was
too
good
at
it
i
not
sure
which
and
as
a
result
i
ended
up
doing
what
i
really
wanted
to
for
a
living
running
a
sailboat
business
he
looked
her
over
you
seem
to
like
what
doing
too
and
from
what
i
seen
i
say
bill
getting
a
bargain
no
matter
what
he
paying
you
she
laughed
i
say
you
an
even
better
bargain
he
getting
you
for
free
freebies
are
only
a
deal
if
they
pan
out
he
lifted
their
steaks
out
of
the
microwave
and
flipped
them
onto
the
grill
they
immediately
sizzled
deliciously
a
sound
he
had
loved
since
he
was
a
child
growing
up
in
pennsylvania
it
all
mingled
together
with
the
scent
of
trees
and
summer
god
those
smell
great
she
came
over
to
take
a
look
i
think
the
aroma
is
giving
me
some
backbone
there
nothing
like
the
smell
of
grease
i
figured
you
come
around
he
patted
her
chastely
on
the
back
half
imagining
it
was
farther
down
then
lifted
one
of
the
steaks
to
see
how
they
were
going
well
just
like
his
spirits
but
now
she
was
moving
off
again
into
a
space
of
her
own
she
scrutinized
his
weathered
face
feeling
a
little
hopeful
that
maybe
finally
she
had
run
across
somebody
like
alan
though
she
still
hardly
knew
a
damned
thing
about
him
with
people
i
meet
for
the
first
time
i
like
to
play
a
little
game
she
said
finally
it
always
interesting
to
try
and
guess
what
are
they
really
like
does
character
show
what
happens
if
you
guess
right
he
nudged
a
steak
do
you
own
their
soul
like
some
primitive
tribes
think
a
photograph
captures
their
spirit
guess
you
have
to
find
out
wo
you
she
checked
him
over
again
okay
he
smiled
and
gave
her
the
same
look
back
but
it
only
fair
if
we
both
get
to
play
so
if
one
of
us
hits
the
truth
what
happens
then
do
we
get
to
go
for
double
jeopardy
be
warned
the
prince
who
learns
the
princess
secrets
can
end
up
getting
more
than
he
bargained
for
she
came
back
full
of
feeling
then
she
paused
for
a
second
thinking
and
began
all
right
i
get
to
go
first
woman
prerogative
and
i
want
to
start
with
the
sailboat
what
did
you
call
it
and
what
it
says
about
you
i
think
it
means
you
a
doer
not
a
talker
i
like
that
maybe
he
felt
uncomfortable
not
sure
what
to
say
so
he
decided
to
let
it
pass
now
it
my
turn
he
leaned
back
and
examined
her
hoping
to
get
it
right
make
a
good
first
impression
ignore
the
fact
she
a
knockout
he
lectured
himself
at
least
for
now
look
for
the
inner
woman
you
like
it
here
he
started
but
the
isolation
means
everybody
knows
everybody
no
privacy
and
you
a
very
private
person
so
to
use
that
famous
cliche
you
bury
yourself
in
your
work
you
could
be
happier
that
goes
for
you
too
she
quickly
began
a
little
startled
that
his
first
insight
had
been
so
close
to
the
mark
and
you
a
loner
the
good
news
is
i
think
you
pretty
loyal
to
friends
to
women
the
downside
is
you
keep
your
friends
to
a
close
circle
hey
i
almost
think
you
been
reading
my
mail
he
seemed
vaguely
discomfited
but
i
bet
you
suffer
from
the
same
malady
you
made
some
tight
friends
early
on
but
not
much
in
that
department
since
they
all
engineers
and
mostly
you
talk
shop
oh
and
no
women
you
want
them
but
you
do
respect
them
enough
they
not
as
committed
as
you
are
in
fact
your
last
good
friend
was
in
college
sometimes
you
have
trouble
getting
next
to
anybody
well
for
the
record
i
admit
that
my
best
friend
was
from
before
college
and
it
a
he
georges
she
decided
to
skip
over
the
matter
of
alan
harris
he
had
been
a
friend
as
well
as
a
lover
a
good
friend
or
so
she
thought
once
but
i
think
the
buzzer
just
went
off
game
over
whoa
do
bail
out
now
just
when
it
getting
good
this
was
your
idea
remember
and
i
not
through
he
leaned
back
okay
really
get
tough
go
personal
you
figure
falling
for
some
guy
might
just
end
up
breaking
your
heart
maybe
it
already
happened
to
you
once
or
twice
so
these
days
you
do
let
things
go
too
far
he
rubbed
at
his
chin
as
he
studied
her
how
i
doing
the
rules
of
the
game
do
include
having
to
answer
questions
she
took
a
deep
breath
mike
vance
was
definitely
better
at
this
than
reckoned
but
if
you
want
to
keep
going
we
have
round
two
back
to
you
i
guess
you
always
in
control
or
you
want
to
be
so
what
happens
is
you
the
things
and
people
around
you
make
them
work
for
you
and
from
the
way
things
have
gone
so
far
i
say
luck
seems
to
be
on
your
side
some
people
are
like
that
and
you
one
of
them
do
be
too
sure
he
checked
the
steaks
again
then
flipped
them
over
they
were
coming
along
nicely
the
fat
around
the
edge
beginning
to
char
the
way
he
liked
luck
always
has
a
way
of
running
out
eventually
tell
me
about
it
she
said
letting
her
voice
trail
off
but
i
also
guess
you
a
homebody
in
your
soul
you
like
a
roaring
fire
and
a
glass
of
wine
and
a
good
book
over
going
out
to
paint
the
town
and
you
probably
just
the
opposite
you
want
to
be
out
in
the
sun
and
wind
and
rain
sitting
around
bores
you
guilty
he
nodded
now
for
round
three
that
glass
of
wine
you
have
with
the
book
is
probably
something
tame
say
chablis
you
drink
mmmm
let
me
see
scotch
is
too
mundane
i
bet
tequila
straight
you
psychic
but
you
missed
the
lime
oh
i
almost
forgot
the
most
important
thing
she
grew
somber
you
like
a
good
battle
so
taking
on
these
thugs
is
going
to
be
the
most
fun
you
had
all
week
that
where
you
just
went
off
the
track
his
eyes
narrowed
the
corners
crinkling
we
definitely
on
the
wrong
end
of
the
odds
here
these
bastards
are
dug
in
they
probably
got
and
we
know
for
sure
they
got
a
lot
of
helpless
people
in
their
grasp
not
a
recipe
for
heroics
it
more
like
one
for
pending
tragedy
he
paused
deciding
it
was
definitely
time
to
change
the
subject
speaking
of
tragedies
it
would
be
a
major
one
if
we
did
have
a
greek
salad
to
go
with
those
steaks
he
walked
over
and
checked
the
fridge
sure
enough
there
was
a
massive
bowl
of
ripe
red
tomatoes
sitting
next
to
a
pile
of
crisp
cucumbers
most
important
of
all
there
was
a
huge
chunk
of
white
feta
cheese
yep
the
chef
had
to
be
greek
and
up
there
on
a
high
kitchen
shelf
were
rows
and
rows
of
olives
curing
in
brine
throw
them
all
together
with
a
little
oregano
lemon
juice
and
olive
oil
and
the
traditional
side
dish
of
greece
was
theirs
just
the
stuff
he
pulled
down
a
jar
of
olive
oil
and
one
of
dark
greek
olives
then
he
selected
some
tomatoes
and
a
cucumber
and
went
to
work
you
know
you
not
a
greek
chef
my
mother
would
have
loved
you
you
making
that
salad
exactly
the
way
she
used
to
she
made
a
face
every
day
god
did
i
get
sick
of
them
all
i
wanted
to
eat
was
french
fries
so
when
i
finally
got
away
off
at
college
i
practically
lived
on
cheeseburgers
and
pizza
for
years
after
that
shame
on
you
this
is
very
wholesome
very
good
for
your
state
of
mind
he
finished
slicing
the
tomatoes
then
opened
the
fridge
and
fished
out
a
couple
of
brown
bottles
of
the
local
beer
retsina
would
be
the
thing
but
this
will
have
to
do
he
looked
over
by
the
way
how
the
steaks
coming
looks
like
our
feast
is
ready
she
pulled
them
off
the
grill
and
onto
plates
how
long
has
it
been
since
you
ate
think
it
about
two
days
now
he
finished
tossing
the
salad
and
served
them
each
a
hearty
helping
did
realize
how
famished
i
was
till
i
smelled
those
broiling
he
popped
the
caps
on
the
beers
and
handed
her
one
bon
appetit
better
eat
hearty
because
this
may
be
the
last
food
we
going
to
see
for
a
while
she
took
a
bite
then
looked
up
chewing
it
delicious
and
i
want
to
say
one
more
thing
about
our
game
a
while
ago
she
stopped
to
swallow
and
i
mean
this
it
always
a
little
sad
when
i
see
a
person
who
can
do
a
lot
of
things
but
does
really
find
total
satisfaction
in
any
of
them
nothing
they
ever
do
really
makes
them
happy
and
i
think
that
you
really
i
bet
that
whenever
you
doing
one
thing
you
always
thinking
about
some
other
things
you
could
be
doing
which
means
you
never
really
content
you
always
want
more
that
pretty
deep
stuff
he
had
launched
hungrily
into
his
steak
maybe
you
right
but
i
not
going
to
come
out
and
admit
it
too
damning
so
let
me
put
it
like
this
maybe
i
happen
to
think
possible
to
care
about
a
lot
of
things
at
once
that
such
as
well
okay
i
give
you
a
instance
i
like
sailing
around
these
islands
but
all
the
time
i
doing
it
i
thinking
about
what
it
must
have
been
like
two
three
thousand
years
ago
the
archaeology
it
intrigued
me
as
long
as
i
can
remember
my
dad
was
the
same
he
spent
his
life
digging
around
in
crete
i
thought
that
was
the
most
marvelous
thing
in
the
world
so
i
did
it
too
for
years
even
wrote
a
book
about
that
island
once
i
loved
the
place
still
do
that
funny
i
was
born
practically
in
the
shadow
of
crete
and
yet
i
only
been
there
a
couple
of
times
she
sighed
well
what
happened
i
mean
to
your
love
affair
with
crete
sounds
like
that
what
it
was
maybe
i
loved
the
place
too
much
i
do
know
he
paused
to
take
a
drink
of
the
beer
cold
and
refreshing
well
when
you
love
somebody
or
something
you
want
to
find
out
everything
there
is
to
know
about
them
but
when
i
did
that
and
told
what
i
concluded
was
the
real
story
or
what
i
passionately
believed
was
the
real
story
nobody
wanted
to
hear
it
i
had
some
ideas
about
the
island
ancient
age
of
glory
that
did
jibe
with
the
standard
theories
made
me
very
unpopular
in
the
world
of
academia
scholars
do
like
their
boats
to
be
rocked
and
you
let
that
get
you
down
she
snorted
being
a
woman
she
had
an
uphill
battle
all
her
life
men
could
be
such
babies
sometimes
see
when
the
world
against
you
that
when
you
supposed
to
fight
hardest
that
always
been
my
rule
i
not
a
quitter
ever
he
winced
and
stopped
eating
hey
i
back
are
i
in
greece
he
looked
at
her
impulsively
wanting
to
touch
her
again
but
it
nice
to
have
somebody
like
you
to
pitch
in
and
help
maybe
we
manage
something
together
maybe
you
should
have
had
somebody
around
the
first
time
god
he
was
really
reminding
her
of
alan
the
same
buttons
maybe
you
not
as
tough
as
you
think
adversity
depresses
me
like
bad
weather
i
prefer
life
without
too
many
psychodramas
and
this
greek
fireball
he
told
himself
had
psychodrama
written
large
all
over
her
still
then
the
question
now
is
what
i
should
do
she
looked
at
him
taking
a
last
bite
go
back
or
stay
with
you
we
need
to
learn
from
experience
with
the
cyclops
vance
said
clicking
back
into
the
real
world
the
giant
had
trapped
him
and
his
crew
and
was
devouring
them
one
by
one
so
how
did
they
overcome
him
they
got
him
plastered
on
some
good
greek
wine
then
put
out
his
eye
with
a
burning
post
that
done
they
proceeded
to
exploit
his
disability
what
are
you
saying
she
frowned
this
guy
is
killing
off
your
people
right
pierre
is
coming
in
with
his
crew
to
try
and
take
this
place
down
but
in
the
meantime
it
would
be
good
if
we
took
a
shot
at
putting
out
their
eyes
put
out
their
eyes
she
was
still
puzzled
it
a
metaphor
it
would
be
extremely
helpful
if
we
could
blind
them
enough
that
they
did
know
arm
was
coming
in
could
the
team
maybe
shut
down
the
radars
something
michael
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
used
his
name
and
she
liked
it
that
why
we
in
this
mess
in
the
first
place
there
are
no
radars
that
could
spot
an
insertion
that
how
these
bastards
got
in
here
in
the
first
place
bill
gets
the
saddam
hussein
military
preparedness
award
there
is
no
radar
to
monitor
the
shore
he
laughed
okay
but
now
that
oversight
has
turned
into
a
plus
what
good
for
the
goose
is
good
for
the
if
there
are
no
peripheral
radars
then
they
not
going
to
know
where
pierre
and
the
boys
make
their
insertion
right
the
bad
guys
are
already
blind
it
got
to
make
a
difference
what
we
need
to
do
he
was
thinking
aloud
is
to
get
them
all
together
in
one
place
not
going
to
let
it
happen
she
was
questing
too
unless
unless
we
can
make
it
happen
something
keep
thinking
he
said
i
do
have
any
ideas
either
but
somebody
better
come
up
with
one
well
let
go
back
up
on
the
mountain
before
they
find
us
here
she
said
finally
clearly
itching
to
get
going
and
do
something
going
to
screw
these
guys
wait
and
see
vance
nodded
wishing
he
could
believe
it
as
confidently
as
she
did
sabri
ramirez
stood
watching
as
the
last
of
the
krytron
detonators
was
secured
in
the
ganglia
of
wiring
that
surrounded
the
explosive
octol
sphere
now
one
of
the
bombs
was
armed
he
liked
the
looks
of
it
the
next
they
have
come
back
yet
wolf
helling
said
interrupting
his
thoughts
do
you
think
there
was
a
problem
he
was
warily
watching
the
bomb
and
its
timer
being
assembled
trying
to
calm
his
nerves
this
was
not
like
playing
with
a
yellow
lump
of
sematach
one
false
move
and
you
would
be
vaporized
any
man
who
pretended
it
did
scare
him
was
a
liar
or
worse
a
fool
maybe
both
the
bomb
did
not
frighten
ramirez
his
mind
did
not
dwell
on
risk
he
assumed
the
pakis
knew
their
job
they
damned
well
better
no
his
current
concern
also
was
what
had
happened
to
moreau
he
had
expected
his
unit
to
return
before
now
so
far
they
had
taken
over
an
hour
on
what
should
have
been
a
simple
operation
with
hostages
dispersed
in
three
locations
ramirez
feared
that
things
were
getting
spread
thin
gamal
had
been
keeping
watch
over
the
guards
and
the
shifts
on
level
three
of
the
accommodations
facility
while
peretz
was
holding
things
together
in
command
but
still
it
would
be
better
if
four
of
the
team
were
not
out
chasing
over
the
island
trying
to
find
some
rogue
guard
he
had
tried
to
reach
them
on
his
but
so
far
he
had
not
been
able
to
raise
anybody
that
was
particularly
troubling
why
should
all
the
radios
suddenly
go
dead
if
there
was
some
difficulty
up
the
hill
surely
they
handling
it
ramirez
tried
to
push
aside
his
misgivings
he
actually
felt
it
was
true
or
should
be
true
he
had
checked
out
moreau
credentials
carefully
investigating
beyond
the
popular
myth
and
what
he
had
found
did
nothing
to
diminish
the
legend
of
the
blond
demon
now
we
ready
to
secure
this
baby
into
the
payload
container
abdoullah
was
saying
i
measured
it
already
and
it
should
fit
with
no
problem
but
we
need
to
hook
up
the
detonators
with
the
telemetry
interface
and
for
that
we
need
peretz
input
he
use
the
fujitsu
in
command
to
blow
this
thing
but
it
all
has
to
be
synchronized
with
the
trajectory
control
he
there
now
ramirez
said
updating
the
trajectory
runs
scheduled
to
be
completed
in
he
checked
his
watch
about
twenty
minutes
when
he
gets
through
we
can
go
ahead
with
the
detonators
everything
is
on
schedule
for
some
reason
abdoullah
did
not
like
the
precise
tone
of
voice
right
he
thought
everything
is
on
schedule
so
when
shujat
and
i
have
finished
our
part
what
then
will
we
be
accidentally
gunned
down
the
way
rais
was
you
claimed
that
was
a
but
you
not
the
kind
of
guy
who
makes
that
kind
of
mistake
okay
so
maybe
rais
got
careless
was
that
your
way
of
making
an
example
of
him
he
motioned
shujat
to
help
lift
the
first
shiny
sphere
into
the
resistant
teflon
payload
container
on
a
conventional
launch
the
container
was
designed
to
be
deployed
by
radio
command
when
the
vehicle
had
captured
low
earth
orbit
the
nose
of
the
vehicle
would
open
and
eject
it
after
which
the
satellite
payload
would
release
this
launch
however
was
hey
they
back
helling
announced
watching
the
door
of
the
clean
room
open
ramirez
looked
up
and
realized
immediately
that
something
was
wrong
moreau
eyes
seemed
slightly
unfocused
and
his
sense
of
balance
was
obviously
impaired
a
man
stumbling
out
of
a
centrifuge
he
also
was
rubbing
at
his
ears
as
though
his
head
were
buzzing
what
in
hell
happened
he
had
never
seen
anyone
with
quite
this
set
of
symptoms
before
they
looked
like
men
who
had
been
too
close
when
a
homemade
bomb
went
off
the
bastard
was
up
on
the
hill
and
he
managed
to
get
control
of
one
of
the
radars
let
me
tell
you
there
nothing
like
it
in
the
world
you
feel
your
head
is
going
to
explode
i
can
barely
hear
he
then
lapsed
into
french
curses
stelios
tritsis
still
had
said
nothing
he
merely
watched
as
rudolph
schindler
and
peter
maier
set
down
the
and
collapsed
onto
the
floor
then
let
him
go
for
now
ramirez
wanted
to
kill
them
all
then
and
there
but
get
that
damned
thing
out
of
here
he
indicated
the
grenade
launcher
and
the
rest
of
you
with
it
take
turns
getting
some
sleep
and
report
back
to
me
at
hours
we
soon
have
our
hands
full
the
natives
here
are
going
to
start
getting
restless
when
that
happens
the
next
man
who
fucks
up
will
have
to
answer
to
me
they
all
knew
what
that
meant
dore
peretz
had
just
finished
checking
over
the
trajectory
analyses
and
he
was
satisfied
that
guidance
would
not
pose
a
problem
with
sort
controlling
the
trajectory
at
a
vehicle
could
be
set
down
with
pinpoint
accuracy
midcourse
correction
abort
the
whole
setup
was
going
to
be
a
cakewalk
the
kid
lefarge
was
good
good
enough
to
make
him
think
he
could
do
without
the
andros
bitch
right
now
nothing
indicated
that
it
could
not
all
be
handled
from
right
here
in
command
with
the
staff
at
hand
okay
he
thought
one
more
chore
out
of
the
way
now
it
time
to
start
setting
up
the
telemetry
hookup
with
the
detonators
chapter
twelve
is
there
anything
we
need
to
go
over
again
pierre
armont
inquired
looking
around
the
dusty
aging
athens
hangar
with
a
feeling
of
wary
confidence
the
benches
and
tables
were
cluttered
with
maps
of
andikythera
and
blueprints
of
the
satcom
facility
scattered
among
bottles
of
ouzo
and
metaxa
he
had
just
completed
his
final
briefing
which
meant
the
time
had
come
to
board
the
cessna
seaplane
that
would
be
their
insertion
platform
the
team
seemed
ready
hans
had
come
through
with
the
troops
they
needed
reggie
sat
eyed
but
prepared
nursing
a
final
brandy
the
brothers
voorst
of
the
royal
dutch
marines
were
austerely
sipping
coffee
dimitri
spiros
was
quietly
meditating
on
the
condition
of
the
equipment
and
marcel
of
the
belgian
esi
was
sketching
one
last
paper
of
the
insertion
when
nobody
spoke
armont
glanced
at
his
watch
and
frowned
this
final
briefing
had
gone
longer
than
expected
but
he
had
to
cover
more
than
the
usual
number
of
complexities
for
one
thing
the
hostages
apparently
were
scattered
all
over
the
place
always
a
problem
unless
the
team
could
strike
several
locations
simultaneously
the
element
of
surprise
would
be
forfeited
that
meant
the
insertion
had
to
be
totally
secure
giving
the
team
time
to
split
up
get
positioned
and
stage
the
final
assault
with
coordination
carrying
out
one
op
was
dicey
enough
he
was
looking
at
three
all
at
once
the
alternate
strategy
would
be
to
focus
exclusively
on
ramirez
take
him
out
first
blow
their
command
structure
and
hope
the
others
would
fold
the
decision
on
that
option
would
have
to
be
made
in
about
two
hours
just
before
they
set
down
the
plane
two
kilometers
west
of
the
island
and
boarded
the
zodiacs
for
insertion
that
was
when
vance
was
scheduled
to
radio
his
intel
on
the
disposition
of
the
hostiles
and
the
friendlies
what
a
stroke
of
luck
to
have
him
there
a
point
man
already
in
place
to
guide
the
team
in
all
right
then
spiros
said
finally
coming
alive
let
do
a
final
check
of
the
equipment
we
need
to
the
lists
and
make
sure
everything
got
delivered
i
do
want
to
hear
a
lot
of
crap
from
you
guys
if
somebody
ca
find
something
later
on
the
others
nodded
dimitri
had
had
to
scramble
to
get
all
the
hardware
together
and
reginald
hall
had
had
to
make
some
expensive
arrangements
to
obtain
a
set
of
balaclava
antiflash
hoods
for
everybody
when
there
were
hostages
everywhere
the
safest
way
to
storm
the
terrorists
was
with
nonlethal
flash
grenades
which
produced
a
blinding
explosion
and
smoke
but
did
not
spew
out
iron
fragments
but
their
use
required
the
assault
to
function
in
the
momentarily
disruptive
environment
they
created
the
hoods
which
protected
the
wearer
face
and
eyes
from
the
smoke
and
flash
were
crucial
and
since
your
local
hardware
store
did
not
stock
them
he
had
borrowed
a
set
from
the
greek
dimoria
eidikon
apostolon
a
swat
unit
of
the
athens
city
police
trained
to
provide
hostage
rescue
securing
six
on
a
no
questions
asked
basis
even
though
everybody
there
knew
they
had
only
one
use
word
of
the
down
on
andikythera
had
not
yet
leaked
out
to
the
world
so
dea
had
not
been
consulted
but
their
record
of
security
at
the
athens
hellinikon
airport
was
so
miserable
he
doubted
they
ever
would
be
considered
for
a
job
like
this
though
the
dea
had
trained
with
the
german
the
british
sas
and
the
royal
dutch
marines
they
still
were
basically
just
cops
a
real
antiterrorist
operation
would
be
out
of
their
league
dea
had
no
illusions
about
that
and
they
also
knew
that
spiros
was
with
arm
arguably
the
best
private
antiterrorist
organization
in
the
world
so
if
they
granted
dimitri
a
favor
they
knew
they
could
someday
call
on
arm
to
repay
in
kind
in
the
antiterrorist
community
everybody
was
on
the
same
team
everybody
understood
the
meaning
of
quid
pro
quo
most
of
the
rest
of
the
equipment
had
been
retrieved
from
the
arm
stocks
the
organization
kept
stored
in
athens
governments
frowned
on
the
transportation
of
heavy
weaponry
around
europe
so
the
association
found
it
convenient
to
have
its
own
private
stocks
at
terminals
in
london
paris
and
athens
it
made
life
simpler
all
around
reggie
hall
had
dictated
the
equipment
list
as
he
drove
in
to
london
in
his
black
jaguar
cursing
the
glut
of
traffic
on
the
once
he
reached
the
arm
office
there
a
small
inconspicuous
townhouse
in
south
kensington
he
faxed
the
list
to
athens
then
caught
a
plane
dimitri
had
checked
out
the
list
against
the
arm
inventory
in
the
warehouse
and
quickly
procured
whatever
was
lacking
it
had
been
packaged
into
crates
then
taken
by
lorry
to
this
small
side
terminal
of
the
hellinikon
airport
ready
to
be
loaded
on
the
unobtrusive
cessna
seaplane
he
had
leased
for
the
operation
by
that
time
the
rest
of
the
team
had
already
started
arriving
then
two
and
a
half
hours
ago
pierre
had
begun
the
briefing
a
counterterrorist
operation
always
had
several
objectives
protecting
the
lives
of
hostages
and
procuring
their
safe
release
isolating
and
containing
the
incident
recovering
seized
property
and
preventing
the
escape
of
the
offenders
but
this
time
there
was
a
twist
to
the
usual
rules
in
a
situation
like
this
possibly
involving
nuclear
weapons
the
recovery
of
those
devices
was
the
paramount
priority
the
way
armont
had
planned
the
assault
arm
could
manage
with
a
man
team
instead
of
the
nine
most
outfits
normally
used
he
would
be
team
leader
which
meant
his
responsibilities
included
supervision
as
well
as
being
in
charge
of
planning
and
execution
controlling
cover
and
entry
elements
and
determining
special
needs
since
vance
was
already
on
the
ground
he
would
be
point
man
providing
reconnaissance
and
recommending
primary
and
alternate
routes
of
approach
the
point
man
in
an
assault
also
led
the
entry
element
during
approach
and
assisted
the
defense
men
in
the
security
finally
he
was
expected
to
pitch
in
and
help
with
the
pyrotechnics
as
needed
the
defense
man
would
be
marcel
the
belgian
who
would
cover
for
the
voorst
brothers
during
the
assault
and
provide
security
for
vance
during
the
approach
he
would
also
double
as
point
man
when
required
and
protect
the
entry
team
from
ambush
during
approach
another
duty
was
to
cover
the
entry
element
during
withdrawal
and
handle
the
heavy
equipment
hans
would
serve
as
the
rear
security
man
following
the
entry
element
during
movement
and
providing
close
cover
during
withdrawal
he
would
be
second
in
command
and
also
would
bring
in
whatever
equipment
was
needed
since
reggie
was
a
crack
shot
the
best
he
would
be
the
standoff
sniper
maintaining
surveillance
on
the
subject
area
from
a
fixed
position
monitoring
radio
frequencies
and
providing
intelligence
on
hostile
movements
he
also
would
neutralize
by
selective
fire
anybody
who
posed
an
imminent
threat
to
the
entry
team
spiros
would
be
the
observer
keeping
a
record
of
everything
for
an
summary
providing
security
for
reggie
and
assisting
in
locating
hostile
personnel
he
would
relieve
hall
as
necessary
and
handle
the
cs
or
smoke
if
pierre
signaled
for
it
that
was
it
for
assignments
everybody
would
be
doing
more
or
less
what
they
always
did
so
far
so
good
the
next
item
was
intelligence
normally
you
tried
to
gather
as
much
as
you
could
and
presumably
vance
was
taking
care
of
that
for
the
rest
of
it
armont
had
dug
up
blueprints
for
all
the
buildings
from
the
files
and
on
the
plane
from
paris
he
had
meticulously
numbered
the
levels
sectorized
the
windows
and
labeled
all
the
openings
ventilation
shafts
et
cetera
at
the
briefing
just
completed
he
had
used
the
blueprints
to
designate
primary
and
secondary
he
would
his
strategy
with
vance
by
radio
once
they
had
made
the
insertion
and
then
after
he
had
located
all
the
terrorists
and
confirmed
the
situation
of
the
hostages
they
would
use
the
blueprints
to
plan
the
assault
next
came
the
equipment
since
the
assault
would
be
at
night
they
would
need
vision
capabilities
that
included
binoculars
starlight
scopes
and
infrared
scopes
then
the
radios
which
had
to
be
with
one
channel
reserved
strictly
for
the
team
and
have
cryptographic
secure
voice
capability
the
surveillance
radio
package
compact
in
size
with
a
short
antenna
included
a
lapel
mike
button
and
earpiece
all
members
of
the
team
would
have
a
radio
worn
in
a
comfortable
position
and
out
of
the
way
as
usual
they
would
employ
strict
communication
discipline
using
their
established
call
signs
and
codes
as
much
as
possible
other
personal
equipment
included
chemical
light
wands
luminous
tape
gloves
protective
glasses
disposable
inserts
for
hearing
protection
black
combat
boots
lightweight
body
armor
balaclavas
flashlights
knives
pouches
insertion
gear
included
grapple
hooks
several
hundred
feet
of
fibrous
nylon
rope
locking
snaplinks
and
rappelling
harnesses
finally
there
was
the
weaponry
everybody
would
carry
a
caliber
automatic
pistol
and
a
caliber
revolver
with
a
special
barrel
the
assault
team
would
use
h
k
except
for
armont
and
hall
pierre
preferred
a
aug
and
reggie
had
brought
along
an
enfield
in
addition
to
his
usual
then
just
in
case
they
had
the
heavy
stuff
launcher
systems
and
shotguns
modified
pump
shotguns
and
psds
god
help
us
armont
thought
if
we
need
all
this
naturally
there
also
were
grenades
they
had
plenty
of
the
standard
fragmentation
type
but
since
these
frequently
were
next
to
useless
in
a
hostage
situation
they
planned
to
rely
more
on
stun
grenades
and
smoke
grenades
the
same
was
true
of
the
incendiary
hand
grenade
a
container
of
thermite
that
burned
at
over
four
thousand
degrees
fahrenheit
for
half
a
minute
it
was
fine
for
burning
up
a
truck
but
not
recommended
for
a
room
full
of
hostages
better
for
that
was
the
smoke
grenade
which
spewed
white
phosphorus
over
an
area
of
about
fifteen
yards
smoke
of
course
could
work
both
ways
also
slowing
up
the
deploying
team
last
but
not
least
were
the
grenades
to
temporarily
neutralize
an
entire
room
arm
had
long
used
the
grenade
which
dispersed
cn
chloraceteophenone
it
was
not
a
gas
but
a
white
crystalline
powder
similar
to
sugar
that
attacked
the
eyes
causing
watering
and
partial
closing
and
simulated
a
burning
sensation
on
the
skin
if
conditions
seemed
to
require
they
sometimes
used
a
stronger
chemical
agent
called
cs
military
shorthand
for
orthochlorobenzalmalononitrile
it
too
was
a
white
crystalline
powder
similar
to
talc
that
produced
immediate
irritating
effects
that
lasted
from
five
to
ten
minutes
the
agent
in
a
cloud
form
caused
a
severe
burning
sensation
of
the
chest
the
eyes
closed
involuntarily
the
nose
ran
moist
skin
burned
and
stung
thereby
rendering
anybody
in
the
immediate
area
incapable
of
effective
action
he
would
choose
which
one
to
use
when
the
time
came
after
hans
had
helped
dimitri
the
equipment
list
armont
looked
over
the
crates
one
last
time
then
gave
the
for
loading
one
good
thing
he
thought
since
andikythera
is
greek
we
wo
be
crossing
any
international
borders
nothing
will
have
to
be
smuggled
through
customs
reggie
impatient
as
always
was
eyeing
the
clock
at
the
far
end
of
the
hangar
we
already
filed
the
fight
plan
i
think
it
time
we
made
this
a
go
op
what
time
is
the
next
radio
check
with
vance
that
scheduled
for
hours
armont
answered
after
we
airborne
we
go
over
the
blueprints
and
compare
them
against
the
disposition
of
the
friendlies
and
hostiles
using
his
intel
then
we
can
decide
the
best
way
to
take
the
place
down
the
boys
are
getting
itchy
he
told
himself
they
want
to
get
this
over
with
and
get
back
to
their
lives
who
can
blame
them
this
never
should
have
happened
in
the
first
place
spiros
let
the
client
set
the
parameters
for
a
job
which
violates
the
first
rule
he
is
going
to
have
a
lot
to
answer
for
when
this
is
over
but
settling
that
will
have
to
wait
till
later
all
right
he
said
starting
up
the
cessna
metal
stairs
and
heading
for
the
cockpit
let
get
tower
clearance
and
roll
the
technicians
in
command
were
all
sprawled
across
their
desks
demoralized
and
still
in
shock
georges
lefarge
shared
their
mood
cally
had
disappeared
hours
ago
and
he
was
beginning
to
think
he
was
on
his
own
the
trajectories
that
peretz
wanted
computed
were
finished
now
the
israeli
wanted
to
work
on
the
telemetry
and
he
wanted
to
do
it
himself
he
had
taken
his
place
at
the
console
and
started
programming
a
new
set
of
instructions
into
big
benny
the
fujitsu
supercomputer
it
looked
as
if
he
was
coordinating
some
of
the
trajectory
telemetry
with
the
electronic
signaling
to
the
vehicle
and
he
was
setting
some
sort
of
timer
lefarge
pondered
the
significance
of
these
actions
he
wants
something
to
happen
when
the
aborts
and
begins
descent
he
told
himself
and
it
has
to
be
done
with
timing
what
can
he
be
planning
he
felt
helpless
as
he
sat
watching
the
control
room
around
him
now
silent
and
listless
locked
out
of
his
own
computer
he
felt
rudderless
and
lost
he
was
realizing
computers
were
a
friend
that
could
easily
be
turned
against
you
it
was
a
moment
of
recognition
that
brought
with
it
pure
anguish
abdoul
kirwani
ambassador
of
the
islamic
republic
of
pakistan
to
the
united
states
of
america
sat
rigidly
facing
the
small
desk
in
the
oval
office
when
the
call
requesting
a
meeting
had
come
from
johan
hansen
chief
of
staff
the
previous
evening
he
had
hastily
sent
a
secure
telex
to
islamabad
to
inquire
if
he
needed
any
updating
he
did
and
it
was
a
disaster
it
past
due
time
we
met
personally
mr
ambassador
president
johan
hansen
was
saying
i
regret
that
the
press
of
affairs
over
the
last
month
forced
me
to
postpone
receiving
you
sooner
state
tells
me
your
credentials
are
impeccable
and
you
doing
a
job
of
getting
up
to
speed
abdoul
kirwani
nodded
his
thanks
modestly
but
with
concealed
pride
he
was
a
tall
elegant
man
with
a
trim
mustache
and
deep
inquisitive
eyes
some
said
he
could
have
been
a
double
for
omar
sharif
a
deeply
guarded
secret
was
that
he
cared
more
about
the
ragas
of
indian
classical
music
than
he
did
about
diplomacy
he
had
made
no
secret
however
of
his
admiration
for
johan
hansen
the
american
president
refocus
of
the
superpower
priorities
was
a
refreshing
breath
of
rationality
and
sanity
in
an
irrational
insane
world
all
of
which
made
this
particular
meeting
even
more
distressing
thank
you
president
my
government
wishes
me
to
express
its
appreciation
for
the
excellent
cooperation
we
have
received
and
the
traditional
american
hospitality
my
family
and
i
have
enjoyed
since
we
arrived
shireen
i
must
say
loves
this
country
as
much
as
i
do
she
studied
at
smith
many
years
ago
and
is
especially
fond
of
new
england
he
smiled
we
pakistanis
always
yearn
for
places
with
a
cool
climate
then
perhaps
someday
you
accord
me
the
honor
of
letting
christin
and
me
show
you
my
new
presidential
hideaway
in
the
berkshires
hansen
smiled
back
chafing
to
cut
the
diplomatic
bullshit
perhaps
sometime
this
autumn
we
think
it
one
of
the
most
beautiful
spots
on
earth
we
would
be
most
honored
he
nodded
again
reading
the
perfectly
now
hansen
could
contain
himself
no
longer
i
want
you
to
understand
mr
ambassador
that
what
i
am
about
to
say
is
not
directed
toward
you
personally
my
staff
tells
me
you
have
been
a
private
advocate
for
some
years
now
of
reducing
and
even
eliminating
nuclear
weapons
worldwide
that
as
you
know
is
my
desire
as
well
so
you
and
i
see
eye
to
eye
unfortunately
however
we
live
in
a
world
where
realities
still
assume
precedence
over
noble
ambitions
i
agree
with
you
president
sadly
but
wholeheartedly
the
pakistani
ambassador
nodded
lightly
dreading
what
he
knew
was
about
to
come
so
the
already
knows
he
realized
this
disaster
is
going
to
turn
out
even
worse
than
i
feared
the
topic
of
nuclear
proliferation
brings
us
i
am
afraid
to
the
subject
at
hand
you
will
forgive
me
if
we
set
aside
our
views
on
the
scenic
american
countryside
for
another
day
time
unfortunately
is
short
i
think
you
will
understand
why
when
you
hear
what
i
have
to
say
hansen
leaned
back
in
his
heavy
chair
hoping
he
had
given
the
right
signals
he
had
been
entirely
sincere
when
he
said
he
liked
kirwani
and
did
not
relish
the
task
immediately
at
hand
mr
ambassador
you
will
not
be
surprised
to
learn
that
this
country
is
well
aware
of
the
gross
violations
of
the
nuclear
nonproliferation
treaty
that
have
taken
place
since
pakistan
refused
to
sign
in
the
entire
world
knows
about
your
uranium
hexafluoride
plant
at
dera
ghazi
khan
and
the
kahuta
facility
where
it
is
enriched
using
german
centrifuges
we
also
know
what
that
enriched
uranium
he
glanced
down
at
his
notes
in
the
percent
range
is
being
used
for
however
we
have
not
been
able
to
dissuade
your
government
from
the
course
it
has
taken
he
paused
quite
frankly
there
not
a
hell
of
a
lot
we
could
do
about
it
without
having
to
make
some
very
undiplomatic
accusations
against
our
staunchest
ally
on
the
asian
subcontinent
kirwani
turned
slightly
pale
although
he
worried
about
india
growing
nuclear
capacities
as
much
as
the
next
pakistani
he
still
did
not
particularly
like
the
idea
of
his
country
having
its
own
secret
nuclear
program
developed
in
part
to
counter
india
the
world
needed
more
dialogue
he
believed
not
more
destruction
however
he
was
being
paid
to
defend
his
personal
views
president
i
not
authorized
to
discuss
the
strategic
security
arrangements
of
my
country
as
i
am
sure
you
can
appreciate
yes
hansen
said
i
can
appreciate
a
hell
of
a
lot
mr
ambassador
for
instance
i
can
appreciate
the
in
military
and
economic
assistance
we
lavished
on
pakistan
over
the
years
there
are
those
in
this
administration
who
think
that
gives
us
the
right
to
a
hearing
you
know
back
when
ronald
reagan
was
president
his
administration
argued
that
we
could
slow
down
pakistan
nuclear
program
by
giving
you
every
other
possible
kind
of
military
aid
so
we
poured
in
everything
you
asked
however
all
that
aid
seems
not
to
have
slowed
your
government
nuclear
efforts
for
so
much
as
a
minute
in
fact
hansen
went
on
the
memory
still
making
him
seethe
what
you
did
was
turn
to
china
for
the
data
you
needed
to
manufacture
nuclear
weapons
without
testing
that
was
the
thanks
we
got
then
an
unproven
accusation
president
kirwani
interjected
lamely
yes
china
denied
it
too
but
the
reagan
administration
took
it
seriously
enough
that
they
halted
formal
approval
of
a
trade
pact
with
china
for
almost
a
year
in
retaliation
we
had
hard
evidence
believe
me
and
then
president
we
are
not
i
sure
here
to
give
each
other
history
lectures
certainly
neither
of
us
has
forgotten
that
during
those
years
there
were
soviet
troops
in
afghanistan
just
over
our
border
we
had
legitimate
security
concerns
that
could
not
always
i
am
speaking
hypothetically
of
course
be
addressed
with
a
strictly
conventional
deterrent
kirwani
tried
to
smile
you
do
understand
of
course
that
this
conversation
is
entirely
hypothetical
of
course
so
let
travel
a
little
farther
into
land
what
we
do
know
is
that
the
soviet
threat
in
afghanistan
is
now
a
thing
of
the
past
world
conditions
have
changed
dramatically
and
there
are
those
in
congress
who
may
choose
to
wonder
why
pakistan
still
has
any
justification
to
stockpile
hypothetically
of
course
these
weapons
american
aid
is
not
written
in
stone
now
is
that
diplomatic
enough
for
you
mr
ambassador
we
are
allies
president
kirwani
replied
calmly
and
allies
work
in
concert
toward
mutual
goals
each
bringing
to
their
alliance
whatever
contribution
can
further
the
ends
of
both
i
do
hope
your
government
believes
it
has
received
as
much
as
it
has
contributed
over
the
years
hansen
tried
not
to
smile
we
never
receive
as
much
as
we
contribute
he
was
thinking
but
then
that
how
the
damned
game
is
played
in
the
interest
of
diplomacy
mr
ambassador
i
suggest
we
move
this
discussion
along
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
a
certain
number
of
weapons
may
now
be
in
hands
neither
of
us
would
wish
the
question
is
how
many
weapons
are
involved
and
what
is
their
yield
ambassador
kirwani
had
been
expecting
the
inquiry
it
was
like
waiting
for
the
other
shoe
to
drop
the
government
in
islamabad
was
beside
itself
appalled
that
controls
had
been
so
lax
and
that
now
the
world
was
going
to
know
exactly
the
extent
of
pakistan
nuclear
program
before
this
ghastly
situation
was
resolved
years
of
secrecy
were
going
to
be
blown
away
yet
in
truth
part
of
him
was
that
the
cat
was
out
of
the
bag
finally
for
either
india
or
pakistan
to
loose
nuclear
weapons
on
the
asian
subcontinent
would
be
to
unleash
the
wrath
of
allah
upon
billions
of
innocents
it
was
truly
unthinkable
you
do
understand
president
that
before
this
conversation
continues
we
must
both
agree
that
it
never
took
place
furthermore
even
if
it
should
take
place
it
would
be
purely
hypothetical
after
hansen
nodded
grimly
kirwani
continued
we
both
know
the
israelis
have
had
uranium
bombs
not
to
mention
hydrogen
bombs
for
many
years
and
yet
they
have
never
admitted
it
publicly
by
maintaining
a
diplomatic
fiction
they
have
kept
their
arab
neighbors
quiet
on
the
subject
they
are
never
called
to
account
the
government
of
pakistan
merely
asks
to
be
accorded
the
same
latitude
to
conduct
our
security
arrangements
as
we
best
see
fit
the
israelis
know
it
is
not
in
their
interest
to
rattle
nuclear
sabers
and
we
know
that
as
well
he
edged
forward
in
his
chair
that
is
assuming
we
possessed
such
sabers
which
i
in
no
way
acknowledge
i
think
we
beginning
to
understand
each
other
hansen
nodded
so
perhaps
that
counts
as
progress
of
course
this
conversation
never
took
place
and
lest
you
wondering
i
do
have
the
oval
office
bugged
the
way
that
idiot
nixon
did
i
believe
terms
like
and
the
record
still
have
meaning
kirwani
found
himself
yearning
for
a
cigarette
though
he
knew
smoking
was
forbidden
here
in
this
presidential
sanctuary
very
well
then
speaking
hypothetically
and
confidentially
i
am
authorized
to
inform
your
government
that
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
there
may
be
two
uranium
bombs
in
the
range
that
may
be
in
the
wrong
hands
somewhere
in
the
world
needless
to
say
my
government
is
extremely
concerned
about
this
and
is
currently
taking
steps
to
establish
a
full
accounting
of
the
situation
kirwani
realized
it
sounded
lame
but
his
government
had
authorized
him
to
deliver
those
words
only
god
help
us
hansen
sighed
it
true
or
maybe
just
a
coincidence
when
were
these
hypothetical
weapons
found
to
be
missing
if
such
a
thing
were
to
be
true
kirwani
continued
ever
cautious
it
might
well
have
been
just
over
a
week
ago
a
final
pause
and
we
have
no
idea
where
they
are
ramirez
watched
with
satisfaction
as
abdoullah
and
shujat
began
loading
the
first
device
into
the
payload
capsule
shujat
had
carefully
attached
the
wiring
of
the
krytrons
to
a
black
box
of
computer
chips
which
was
itself
connected
to
a
radio
receiver
part
of
the
telemetry
for
with
the
bomb
primed
the
unsuspecting
satcom
crew
could
now
move
the
weapon
its
fifteen
kilograms
of
grade
waiting
to
be
imploded
upon
itself
up
the
gantry
and
into
the
satellite
bay
of
that
completed
work
would
begin
on
preparing
the
second
device
which
was
going
to
serve
as
a
backup
when
peretz
finished
only
the
computer
would
know
the
location
of
the
first
target
total
security
which
meant
nobody
would
be
able
to
activate
any
antimissile
defense
systems
all
of
europe
would
be
at
risk
though
the
real
target
would
in
fact
be
among
the
most
obvious
with
the
entire
mediterranean
sixth
fleet
now
anchored
at
souda
bay
a
nuclear
explosion
there
would
change
the
equation
of
power
throughout
europe
and
the
middle
east
it
was
high
time
the
eastern
bloc
had
turned
its
back
on
its
muslim
friends
in
the
region
leaving
them
to
fend
for
themselves
the
east
had
betrayed
the
arab
cause
just
as
it
had
betrayed
him
in
the
old
days
eastern
european
governments
hired
him
in
desperation
then
half
the
time
tried
to
kill
him
after
he
had
carried
out
their
objectives
even
a
purchaser
of
his
services
nicolae
ceausescu
had
eventually
turned
against
him
but
he
had
seen
it
coming
even
back
when
he
had
been
the
personal
of
that
late
strongman
enjoying
the
hospitality
of
his
plush
seaside
resort
that
time
his
beretta
had
saved
the
day
and
now
here
now
that
the
launch
time
for
the
first
vehicle
was
drawing
near
he
was
feeling
more
and
more
comfortable
about
the
under
his
jacket
this
ad
hoc
collection
of
operatives
he
had
brought
along
was
going
to
start
getting
edgy
more
so
as
the
hours
ticked
by
the
first
to
crack
he
knew
would
be
the
two
remaining
pakistani
engineers
but
they
were
amateurs
which
meant
they
posed
no
real
threat
more
than
that
their
usefulness
was
soon
going
to
be
at
an
end
no
they
were
the
problem
now
the
problem
was
going
to
be
egress
when
this
was
all
over
but
the
old
man
who
had
been
the
professor
years
ago
was
a
hostage
made
in
heaven
and
then
of
course
there
was
the
ceo
bates
nobody
was
going
to
shoot
down
a
chopper
with
those
two
luminaries
aboard
although
egress
was
the
consideration
there
also
was
a
concern
salim
was
reporting
from
command
that
the
radio
had
a
lot
of
scrambled
traffic
the
airwaves
were
beginning
to
have
the
feeling
of
an
assault
in
the
making
okay
we
ready
shujat
announced
standing
back
to
admire
his
handiwork
the
armed
bomb
nestled
in
its
case
surrounded
with
wrap
the
truck
that
would
take
it
from
the
clean
room
to
the
gantry
area
was
standing
alongside
the
bench
the
weapon
itself
accompanied
by
its
electronics
weighed
over
a
hundred
kilograms
but
they
used
a
forklift
to
lower
it
down
very
carefully
shujat
was
nervous
although
octol
was
an
extremely
stable
compound
which
made
it
an
ideal
explosive
to
implode
the
enriched
uranium
still
your
instincts
said
to
be
careful
one
nice
thing
about
a
nuke
though
if
it
went
off
accidentally
you
never
know
you
be
vaporized
before
your
neurons
and
synapses
had
a
chance
to
get
their
act
together
you
were
gone
baby
atoms
take
it
up
and
get
it
on
the
vehicle
ramirez
ordered
from
now
on
we
work
straight
through
the
two
pakistanis
nodded
and
began
slipping
a
large
plastic
covering
around
the
crate
the
procedure
which
they
were
following
involved
encasing
a
satellite
payload
in
a
sterile
plastic
wrap
to
protect
it
from
contamination
when
it
was
being
transferred
to
the
gantry
area
they
zipped
up
the
plastic
after
which
shujat
unsealed
the
airlock
door
and
returned
to
help
abdoullah
roll
the
white
wheeled
truck
through
down
the
hallway
they
glided
with
all
the
insouciance
of
two
grocery
boys
delivering
a
case
of
beer
the
launch
facility
was
compact
and
efficient
and
the
gantry
elevator
was
only
some
fifty
meters
from
the
clean
room
the
hallway
itself
was
now
deserted
as
all
the
satcom
personnel
were
dutifully
in
their
prescribed
work
areas
via
computer
messages
peretz
had
advised
the
satcom
tech
crews
that
the
arlington
office
had
put
the
launch
schedule
on
a
crash
basis
and
everybody
had
to
stay
at
his
post
there
had
been
grumbling
but
everybody
was
determined
to
get
with
the
program
after
all
satcom
was
a
team
an
electronic
eye
opened
the
sealed
doors
leading
into
the
gantry
area
it
too
was
spotlessly
clean
with
technicians
busying
to
ready
the
elevator
everything
was
being
prepared
for
a
countdown
ramirez
looked
the
scene
over
straightening
his
tie
how
ironic
and
amusing
to
have
all
these
young
americans
doing
your
bidding
the
sense
of
power
and
irony
was
delicious
this
is
the
new
payload
he
announced
with
the
authority
that
had
long
since
become
second
nature
open
the
elevator
and
take
it
up
was
there
and
he
looked
ramirez
over
again
still
wondering
who
this
guy
was
andros
had
been
around
for
a
while
and
all
of
a
sudden
this
asshole
was
calling
the
shots
was
he
bill
bates
new
it
did
make
any
sense
but
then
something
funny
was
definitely
going
on
the
communications
system
with
command
was
all
screwed
up
nobody
could
reach
andros
everybody
was
ordered
to
stay
at
their
posts
and
not
take
a
break
and
there
had
even
been
what
sounded
like
gunfire
from
the
sector
where
the
clean
room
was
none
of
these
things
boded
well
but
he
said
nothing
just
nodded
in
acquiescence
and
opened
the
door
leading
to
the
gantry
module
the
two
new
satcom
technicians
who
had
also
shown
up
with
the
new
aic
asshole
in
charge
rolled
on
the
cart
which
was
carrying
some
mysterious
new
payload
the
gantry
elevator
itself
operated
inside
a
mobile
tower
that
rolled
on
rails
thereby
allowing
it
to
be
motored
next
to
the
vehicle
and
at
the
lower
level
opened
into
the
launch
facility
from
the
lower
level
technicians
could
insert
the
payload
module
which
then
would
be
hoisted
to
the
top
of
the
gantry
and
inserted
into
the
vehicle
nose
cone
when
the
vehicle
was
fully
prepped
and
ready
for
launch
they
would
roll
the
gantry
with
its
elevator
some
fifty
meters
down
the
track
until
thirty
minutes
earlier
the
gantry
elevator
had
been
stationed
at
the
midpoint
of
the
vehicle
where
technicians
were
loading
the
propellant
and
making
the
final
adjustments
to
the
quartz
mirrors
and
nozzles
now
that
they
had
finished
that
task
they
could
begin
the
countdown
only
the
payload
remained
to
be
installed
watched
as
the
technicians
secured
the
trolley
its
wrapped
package
and
the
two
new
dudes
a
couple
of
camel
jockeys
some
of
the
guys
said
they
thought
they
seen
at
berkeley
into
the
module
and
closed
the
door
in
half
an
hour
time
it
would
be
installed
and
the
countdown
could
begin
willem
voorst
was
at
the
controls
of
the
cessna
as
they
powered
through
the
aegean
night
their
heading
as
they
closed
rapidly
on
andikythera
he
was
holding
their
altitude
at
five
hundred
meters
their
airspeed
just
under
a
hundred
knots
barely
above
stall
when
they
were
about
ten
klicks
out
he
would
take
the
plane
down
to
two
hundred
meters
then
set
down
about
two
kilometers
northeast
of
the
island
the
last
stage
of
the
insertion
would
be
via
two
zodiac
rubber
raiding
craft
and
then
finally
scuba
everything
still
looked
like
a
go
reggie
was
leading
hans
and
the
rest
of
the
team
through
a
final
review
of
the
facility
blueprints
while
armont
was
in
the
cockpit
on
the
sideband
radio
to
vance
roger
sirene
vance
was
saying
we
in
the
communications
blockhouse
up
on
the
mountain
so
we
a
little
out
of
touch
but
our
best
guess
is
that
terror
one
is
still
down
at
launch
everybody
else
is
scattered
all
over
the
facility
that
suggests
an
obvious
option
copy
ulysses
armont
replied
that
means
plan
b
we
have
to
take
down
that
point
and
then
secure
the
devices
behead
the
dragon
then
see
what
left
my
hunch
vance
concurred
is
that
if
you
take
out
ramirez
the
rest
of
them
will
fold
he
their
main
man
but
i
suggest
extreme
caution
he
a
pro
copy
that
ulysses
hang
on
while
i
put
you
on
standby
do
go
away
i
copy
armont
paused
to
search
the
sea
below
with
his
ir
goggles
while
he
scanned
the
military
frequencies
neither
pleased
him
a
new
storm
was
growing
building
in
intensity
and
it
would
complicate
matters
but
even
worse
the
military
frequencies
on
the
radio
were
abuzz
reggie
something
going
on
around
here
and
i
do
like
it
he
shouted
back
to
the
cabin
his
voice
strong
above
the
roar
of
the
engines
as
he
scanned
frequencies
there
too
much
radio
traffic
in
the
area
all
scrambled
what
do
you
think
i
worried
the
americans
are
then
it
came
the
radio
crackled
in
crisp
military
english
unidentified
aircraft
this
is
united
states
navy
warship
yankee
bravo
you
are
entering
a
controlled
sector
this
airspace
is
currently
off
limits
to
civilian
aviation
please
identify
yourself
repeat
we
must
have
your
id
and
destination
shit
armont
blanched
he
turned
back
to
the
cabin
and
motioned
for
dimitri
spiros
to
come
to
the
cockpit
and
take
the
headset
give
them
the
cover
we
a
medical
charter
delivering
emergency
blood
supplies
to
apollonion
general
in
heraklion
strictly
civilian
spiros
nodded
took
the
headset
and
settled
himself
in
the
seat
is
icarus
aviation
delta
one
we
have
an
approved
flight
plan
from
athens
to
iraklion
crete
what
the
problem
yankee
bravo
icarus
delta
one
we
got
an
exercise
under
way
for
the
next
hours
no
civilian
aircraft
are
allowed
within
a
sector
from
latitude
to
and
longitude
to
going
to
vector
you
back
to
athens
spiros
switched
off
his
mike
and
yelled
back
at
armont
problem
looks
like
the
navy
cordoned
off
andikythera
it
hot
does
sound
like
they
going
to
take
no
for
an
answer
so
that
what
all
the
radio
activity
was
about
armont
dark
eyes
flashed
satisfaction
that
at
least
one
mystery
was
solved
but
they
quickly
turned
grim
well
we
got
to
go
in
give
them
the
cover
again
and
insist
it
an
emergency
they
can
check
it
out
it
all
in
the
flight
plan
we
filed
which
was
of
course
bogus
the
routing
was
intended
to
take
them
directly
over
andikythera
where
they
would
ditch
see
if
they
buy
the
emergency
story
and
give
us
an
iff
and
clearance
he
continued
but
whatever
happens
we
damned
sure
not
going
to
turn
back
i
give
it
a
shot
spiros
yelled
but
i
do
think
it
going
to
happen
they
going
to
insist
we
exit
from
the
area
then
file
another
flight
plan
that
takes
us
around
it
standard
well
try
anyway
armont
barked
knowing
that
the
greek
was
right
things
were
definitely
headed
off
the
track
spiros
clicked
on
the
mike
yankee
bravo
we
have
a
flight
plan
filed
with
athens
control
nobody
advised
us
this
airspace
was
off
limits
we
making
an
emergency
delivery
of
blood
plasma
to
the
apollonion
general
hospital
in
iraklion
we
filed
a
manifest
with
the
flight
plan
it
a
perishable
cargo
and
we
have
to
have
it
in
their
hands
by
hours
tomorrow
sorry
about
that
delta
one
but
this
airspace
has
been
quarantined
to
all
civilian
traffic
as
of
hours
no
matter
what
on
your
manifest
you
going
to
have
to
radio
athens
and
amend
your
filing
spiros
shrugged
clicked
off
his
mike
and
glanced
back
with
an
i
told
you
so
look
now
what
they
acquired
us
on
radar
so
there
no
way
we
can
proceed
we
try
it
and
they
scramble
something
and
escort
us
out
of
the
area
at
gunpoint
i
say
we
reamed
it
was
a
tough
call
but
armont
made
it
without
hesitation
he
strode
toward
the
cockpit
and
shouted
to
voorst
take
her
down
to
three
hundred
meters
and
get
ready
the
dutchman
nodded
as
armont
stepped
back
to
the
cabin
okay
gentlemen
listen
up
we
have
to
make
a
decision
and
i
think
better
vote
on
it
we
got
three
options
we
can
cancel
the
op
and
turn
back
we
can
go
on
the
deck
and
try
our
luck
at
evading
their
radar
or
we
can
abort
and
take
our
chances
if
we
do
that
probably
mount
a
search
but
with
any
luck
we
be
written
off
i
say
we
do
it
word
of
warning
though
if
we
screw
this
one
up
the
organization
is
going
to
take
some
heat
the
men
looked
at
each
other
each
doing
his
own
quick
calculus
it
would
be
the
first
time
arm
had
found
itself
having
to
work
outside
the
system
to
save
the
system
frequently
the
group
or
government
that
hired
them
ended
up
for
political
expediency
formally
denouncing
whatever
they
had
done
but
it
was
a
flap
accompanied
by
a
wink
and
it
always
dissipated
after
any
obligatory
moral
indignation
was
ventilated
this
time
however
if
the
op
went
sour
it
might
not
be
so
easy
to
explain
away
reginald
hall
the
most
conservative
of
them
all
looked
the
most
worried
he
had
a
good
civilian
cover
and
he
wanted
to
keep
it
that
way
you
know
if
we
get
picked
up
and
detained
it
going
to
be
bloody
sticky
half
of
the
new
chaps
at
special
projects
these
days
think
i
raise
radishes
for
a
living
it
would
be
bloody
awkward
to
end
up
in
a
greek
jail
or
worse
do
think
i
get
invited
to
the
queen
birthday
anymore
hans
was
smiling
reggie
you
old
fossil
let
me
get
this
straight
you
do
mind
getting
killed
on
an
op
but
you
do
want
to
get
embarrassed
socially
i
say
you
got
a
priorities
problem
the
difference
hall
replied
testily
is
that
i
can
control
what
happens
on
a
regular
op
but
now
you
saying
we
might
have
to
fight
our
way
through
the
navy
just
to
get
in
that
bloody
imprudent
mates
well
armont
interjected
shouting
as
he
gazed
around
the
cabin
waiting
we
still
about
thirty
klicks
out
which
means
that
if
we
ditch
her
now
an
insert
tonight
is
out
of
the
question
plus
we
be
exposed
i
waiting
to
hear
a
veto
if
we
going
to
risk
balls
just
to
save
vance
it
got
to
be
unanimous
whatever
we
do
we
do
together
he
paused
i
know
what
you
thinking
can
vance
handle
it
for
another
hours
personally
i
think
he
can
put
together
enough
moves
to
gain
us
the
time
but
who
knows
he
looked
around
with
an
air
of
finality
okay
i
take
it
silence
is
consent
that
was
when
willem
shouted
from
the
cockpit
pierre
we
just
acquired
an
about
fifteen
klicks
out
and
closing
fast
all
right
lads
armont
ordered
time
to
get
the
show
going
break
out
the
zodiacs
and
assemble
your
gear
the
cabin
erupted
in
action
they
had
been
expecting
to
deplane
at
sea
but
this
was
not
how
they
had
planned
to
do
it
i
suspected
all
along
we
were
a
bunch
of
damned
fools
armont
laughed
as
he
strode
toward
the
cockpit
now
i
know
for
sure
he
glanced
at
his
watch
sixty
seconds
he
passed
spiros
as
he
reclaimed
the
copilot
seat
next
to
willem
voorst
what
was
our
eta
for
andikythera
we
would
have
made
the
site
in
more
minutes
okay
i
got
to
alert
michael
he
flicked
on
the
sideband
ulysses
do
you
copy
loud
and
clear
sirene
looks
like
we
got
a
problem
old
buddy
the
trusty
usn
has
shut
down
the
airspace
around
the
island
closed
it
to
commercial
traffic
do
like
the
sound
of
that
it
getting
a
little
lonesome
down
here
from
the
look
of
things
it
may
get
worse
we
going
to
have
to
slip
the
original
insertion
we
need
another
hours
can
you
hang
on
that
long
hey
i
making
new
friends
all
the
time
no
problem
the
downside
is
that
the
rockets
may
start
going
up
i
still
trying
to
get
a
handle
on
that
end
of
it
now
it
sounds
like
i
may
have
to
look
into
trying
to
reschedule
things
a
little
we
need
a
breather
armont
said
our
options
do
look
too
good
at
this
end
but
we
be
there
so
do
believe
anything
you
hear
on
the
radio
all
things
may
not
be
what
they
appear
copy
that
have
a
nice
day
roger
armont
clicked
off
the
mike
all
right
he
turned
and
motioned
spiros
back
to
the
cockpit
tell
them
we
losing
radio
contact
and
our
navigation
gear
is
going
say
we
going
to
have
to
reduce
altitude
and
fly
with
a
compass
and
visuals
maybe
that
will
muddy
things
long
enough
to
get
us
down
dimitri
spiros
hit
the
radio
and
delivered
the
message
to
total
disbelief
that
a
crock
delta
one
assume
a
heading
of
immediately
and
get
the
hell
out
of
this
airspace
immediately
do
you
acknowledge
transmission
breaking
up
spiros
replied
toggling
the
switch
back
and
forth
as
he
did
to
add
some
credibility
to
his
assertion
that
more
bullshit
delta
one
either
you
acknowledge
or
spiros
switched
off
the
microphone
we
got
to
put
her
in
now
captain
jake
morton
was
piloting
the
super
tomcat
and
he
honestly
could
believe
this
was
all
that
serious
he
and
his
officer
frank
brady
had
been
scrambled
on
short
notice
and
though
he
relished
the
chance
to
clock
a
little
flight
time
he
felt
in
his
bones
that
this
was
a
red
herring
he
did
even
have
a
wingman
which
told
him
that
command
on
the
kennedy
probably
was
too
excited
either
the
blip
on
the
vsd
vertical
simulation
display
was
some
tin
can
cruising
just
above
the
chop
down
there
pulling
around
a
hundred
knots
and
now
losing
altitude
obviously
just
some
civilian
asshole
who
was
going
to
make
it
unless
he
pulled
out
damned
soon
he
had
to
be
close
to
stall
problem
was
though
the
bogey
had
responded
to
the
kennedy
radio
room
with
some
medical
charter
malarkey
and
then
shut
down
what
was
that
all
about
and
now
were
these
guys
really
having
radio
and
nav
problems
like
they
said
or
were
they
about
to
try
something
funny
some
amateur
attempt
at
evasion
well
he
thought
if
that
their
game
they
pretty
fucking
dumb
so
what
the
hell
was
the
real
story
he
learned
one
thing
in
fifteen
years
of
navy
when
you
did
know
what
could
happen
you
planned
for
the
worst
he
switched
on
the
intercom
and
ordered
brady
to
turn
on
the
system
tcs
the
powerful
nose
video
and
use
the
radar
to
focus
it
bringing
up
the
image
from
down
below
for
computer
optimization
yankee
bravo
this
is
birdseye
he
said
into
his
helmet
mike
bogey
that
id
itself
as
icarus
delta
one
has
still
got
a
heading
of
about
but
now
he
definitely
losing
altitude
in
fact
he
practically
in
the
drink
we
trying
to
get
him
on
the
tcs
and
take
a
look
roger
came
back
the
voice
we
lost
radio
contact
advise
extreme
caution
whoever
the
hell
he
is
he
a
bogey
i
want
him
the
hell
out
of
this
airspace
do
waste
time
with
the
tcs
get
a
visual
copy
yankee
bravo
want
me
to
fly
down
for
a
confirmed
birdseye
and
assume
you
got
a
hostile
on
your
hands
caution
advised
repeat
assume
he
a
hostile
roger
we
copy
morton
tapped
the
stick
and
his
banked
into
a
steep
dive
pounds
of
steel
plummeting
downward
what
am
i
doing
he
asked
himself
again
as
he
watched
his
altimeter
begin
to
spin
i
buzz
the
guy
and
i
probably
scare
hell
out
of
him
he
wind
up
in
the
soup
for
sure
and
if
he
still
does
respond
then
what
am
i
supposed
to
shoot
down
a
civilian
the
very
thought
made
his
new
mustache
itch
a
clear
sign
of
nerves
such
things
had
been
done
before
but
captain
jake
morton
had
never
done
them
and
he
had
no
interest
in
starting
a
new
trend
in
his
career
he
had
a
wife
and
kids
he
still
had
to
look
in
the
face
on
the
other
hand
a
close
encounter
would
definitely
get
their
attention
but
then
these
were
international
waters
and
the
legality
of
interdicting
civilian
traffic
was
not
all
that
obvious
and
might
be
even
less
obvious
in
a
court
of
law
some
faraway
day
particularly
if
it
really
was
a
medical
emergency
situation
like
those
bozos
down
there
claimed
could
make
for
exceptionally
bad
press
which
did
do
a
thing
for
promotions
in
the
navy
all
right
armont
said
reaching
for
the
microphone
we
got
to
confirm
with
mike
he
got
to
know
what
going
on
he
flicked
the
dial
on
the
radio
ulysses
do
you
read
come
in
i
copy
what
the
story
insert
is
a
definite
abort
repeat
abort
insert
we
expecting
some
company
red
white
and
blue
that
going
to
blow
everything
you
got
a
roger
ulysses
how
far
are
you
from
andikythera
looks
like
about
twenty
klicks
armont
answered
you
were
timed
for
can
vou
still
make
it
tonight
at
all
doubtful
even
with
the
two
zodiacs
and
outboards
by
the
time
we
reached
there
it
be
almost
daylight
we
may
have
to
revise
the
insert
plus
how
about
your
gear
vance
voice
betrayed
his
concern
we
need
hardware
the
hostiles
are
loaded
for
bear
you
we
do
what
we
can
we
do
like
it
either
oh
he
had
just
glanced
at
the
radar
company
here
ulysses
stay
up
on
this
frequency
copy
armont
turned
to
voorst
okay
we
got
to
ditch
now
that
probably
an
he
pointed
to
the
radar
screen
and
he
going
to
be
on
us
in
less
than
two
minutes
we
have
to
give
him
something
to
talk
about
back
in
the
briefing
room
willem
voorst
was
staring
through
the
cockpit
windscreen
at
the
dark
choppy
sea
skimming
by
just
below
the
fuselage
hang
on
the
arm
gear
was
packed
in
waterproof
containers
and
the
zodiac
rafts
were
by
the
doors
ready
to
eject
willem
loosened
his
flight
helmet
and
dropped
the
flaps
i
hope
this
baby
is
insured
by
somebody
it
insured
armont
said
grimacing
to
think
of
the
paperwork
that
lay
ahead
we
just
had
a
malfunction
that
my
professional
opinion
the
storm
had
cut
visuals
to
a
minimum
and
the
puddle
hopper
down
there
was
still
not
responding
morton
figured
if
giving
the
guy
a
flyby
did
get
his
attention
then
command
would
want
to
hand
him
a
little
heat
say
a
tracer
from
the
tomcat
cannon
he
prayed
it
would
come
to
that
because
that
might
well
cause
the
guy
to
pee
in
his
pants
and
go
down
for
sure
what
the
hell
was
going
on
anyway
the
wing
had
shipped
out
of
souda
with
less
than
an
hour
notice
there
still
had
been
a
briefing
the
whole
thing
was
some
exercise
nobody
could
figure
and
now
this
bullshit
he
thought
again
about
the
rumor
going
around
the
flight
deck
of
the
kennedy
that
an
awacs
had
been
brought
up
from
saudi
to
monitor
all
air
traffic
in
the
area
what
the
hell
was
that
about
command
had
dropped
a
hint
about
terrorists
but
this
whole
mobilization
seemed
like
using
a
phoenix
missile
on
a
mosquito
then
just
as
he
had
feared
the
radio
crackled
again
birdseye
this
is
the
tao
i
just
got
you
authorization
to
lay
a
tracer
alongside
that
bogey
if
he
refuses
to
acknowledge
your
flyby
please
repeat
for
verify
morton
had
expected
it
but
he
was
about
to
jeopardize
his
career
over
a
misunderstood
radio
transmission
you
have
positive
authorization
to
lay
one
tracer
in
the
vicinity
of
icarus
delta
one
monitor
her
response
and
we
will
advise
procedure
roger
but
first
let
me
try
to
raise
them
on
the
radio
one
last
time
that
cooks
it
morton
told
himself
guess
they
want
to
play
hardball
with
these
assholes
whatever
this
called
exercise
is
all
about
somebody
upstairs
is
taking
it
all
very
seriously
but
then
who
knew
maybe
those
guys
down
there
were
terrorists
word
had
already
reached
the
kennedy
lower
decks
about
the
glover
being
shot
all
to
hell
in
a
attack
which
meant
caution
was
the
byword
the
rumor
mill
also
had
it
that
terrorists
had
seized
one
of
the
small
greek
islands
in
this
area
was
that
it
was
the
quarantine
intended
to
keep
them
from
bringing
in
reinforcements
to
interdict
them
if
they
tried
to
get
away
had
the
navy
been
made
into
a
watchdog
a
pretty
lowly
station
after
the
glories
in
the
gulf
he
spoke
over
the
cockpit
intercom
the
ics
advising
brady
of
the
authorization
it
was
a
formality
since
frank
had
monitored
all
the
radio
talk
brady
said
shit
then
flipped
on
the
weapons
station
and
armed
it
we
hot
the
radio
crackled
again
and
this
time
willem
voorst
flicked
a
switch
so
the
entire
cabin
could
hear
delta
one
this
is
captain
jake
morton
united
states
navy
i
giving
you
one
last
warning
you
have
been
instructed
to
alter
your
heading
to
and
exit
this
airspace
if
you
do
not
comply
i
am
authorized
to
employ
whatever
degree
of
force
is
necessary
to
make
sure
you
do
not
proceed
what
is
your
intention
i
repeat
what
is
your
intention
all
right
armont
said
this
is
it
the
pontoons
bounced
across
the
chop
as
voorst
touched
down
he
reversed
the
props
and
in
seconds
had
brought
the
cessna
to
an
abrupt
halt
its
frail
fuselage
bobbing
like
a
cork
with
the
storm
coming
up
the
sea
was
rougher
than
it
looked
hans
immediately
opened
the
door
then
nodded
back
to
the
cabin
and
reached
for
the
line
attached
to
the
first
raft
he
had
done
this
dozens
of
times
before
but
it
always
was
scary
you
had
to
watch
out
for
the
motor
inflate
the
raft
from
the
doorway
then
get
your
gear
in
all
the
while
keeping
hold
of
the
line
do
it
wrong
and
you
could
lose
the
whole
thing
okay
reggie
armont
yelled
time
to
earn
your
share
what
bloody
share
it
fifteen
percent
of
nothing
hall
sighed
and
stared
out
the
cessna
open
doorway
even
in
the
dim
moonlight
he
could
see
the
whitecaps
thrown
up
by
the
chop
and
he
felt
his
testicles
tighten
this
is
going
to
be
a
hell
of
an
insertion
he
cinched
the
straps
of
the
backpack
containing
his
gear
armont
watched
him
swing
out
and
down
knowing
he
hated
the
moment
then
motioned
for
hugo
voorst
to
step
up
to
the
doorway
hurry
we
may
be
eating
some
cannon
fire
any
time
now
voorst
moved
up
quickly
he
glanced
toward
the
cockpit
one
last
time
then
seized
his
gear
and
dropped
down
his
brother
who
was
still
setting
the
charge
would
be
the
last
out
our
new
escort
is
going
to
have
us
dead
to
rights
in
about
sixty
seconds
willem
announced
from
up
front
everybody
out
now
armont
was
securing
the
last
of
the
gear
needed
for
the
insertion
and
the
assault
readying
it
to
be
passed
through
the
hatch
while
willem
voorst
was
finishing
with
the
charge
of
armont
looked
around
the
cabin
one
last
time
hoping
they
had
gotten
everything
they
absolutely
needed
several
crates
of
backup
gear
would
have
to
be
left
but
unexpected
contingencies
went
with
the
territory
with
that
sober
last
thought
he
signaled
to
voorst
who
was
ready
with
the
detonator
set
it
for
seconds
that
should
be
enough
as
the
dutchman
nodded
he
reached
for
the
rope
and
dropped
willem
spun
the
dials
on
the
timer
then
wrapped
it
against
the
dull
orange
stick
of
and
tossed
it
into
the
copilot
seat
in
seconds
he
was
at
the
open
doorway
swinging
down
the
line
and
into
the
dark
below
now
morton
was
really
puzzled
the
pilot
had
just
gone
into
the
drink
what
had
happened
maybe
he
was
thinking
he
should
call
in
a
huey
for
a
rescue
op
no
this
setup
was
starting
to
smell
to
high
heaven
they
had
refused
to
change
their
heading
so
the
bastards
had
to
be
up
to
no
good
no
legitimate
civilian
aircraft
would
ignore
a
navy
now
finally
he
could
make
a
visual
rough
through
the
downpour
but
it
looked
like
it
was
a
fucking
seaplane
so
instead
of
responding
to
orders
to
vector
out
of
the
airspace
they
had
settled
in
wiseguys
well
even
with
the
stormy
sea
down
there
they
still
could
take
off
leave
the
same
way
they
came
in
and
nothing
would
be
made
of
it
first
though
they
needed
a
short
lesson
in
aviation
protocol
frank
let
me
handle
this
i
going
to
get
their
fucking
attention
using
his
right
thumb
he
toggled
the
weapons
selector
on
the
side
of
the
throttle
quadrant
down
from
past
sw
and
into
the
setting
marked
guns
the
cannon
was
primed
with
two
tracers
which
should
give
the
bastards
something
to
think
about
now
the
red
radar
lock
on
his
hud
was
flashing
that
asshole
down
there
whoever
it
was
was
in
for
a
big
fucking
surprise
his
thumb
was
about
to
depress
the
red
fire
button
when
the
first
explosion
came
down
below
a
giant
fireball
illuminated
the
night
sky
followed
by
secondaries
jesus
medical
supplies
right
that
little
cessna
was
a
flying
munitions
bin
they
really
a
pillar
of
black
smoke
now
covered
the
entire
area
he
ordered
brady
to
switch
off
the
weapons
station
and
then
his
hand
trembling
he
toggled
his
oxygen
regulator
up
a
notch
trying
to
catch
his
breath
as
he
pulled
back
on
the
stick
ulysses
armont
voice
was
coming
over
the
radio
mixed
with
static
do
you
copy
at
least
they
okay
vance
thought
transmission
is
lousy
sirene
what
happened
we
had
to
take
a
swim
about
twenty
klicks
too
soon
which
means
we
definitely
scratch
the
original
eta
right
does
the
still
look
firm
assuming
we
do
get
any
more
surprises
this
one
is
turning
into
a
bitch
do
they
all
vance
said
everybody
is
in
good
shape
so
nothing
else
has
changed
vance
looked
around
the
mountain
and
wished
he
could
believe
that
the
whole
thing
could
have
been
over
in
another
three
or
four
hours
now
the
terrorists
had
time
to
arm
the
vehicles
and
maybe
even
get
one
up
life
was
about
to
get
a
lot
more
complicated
he
finally
spoke
into
the
mike
let
keep
in
radio
contact
the
deployment
here
keeps
changing
who
knows
what
it
be
like
by
then
we
roger
that
armont
spoke
quickly
to
somebody
else
then
came
back
there
should
be
plenty
of
time
to
chat
for
you
maybe
but
i
not
so
sure
how
much
spare
time
there
going
to
be
on
this
end
i
try
to
hold
everything
down
till
tomorrow
but
it
going
to
be
tough
if
you
ca
raise
me
then
just
proceed
as
planned
i
be
expendable
that
a
touching
sentiment
ulysses
but
you
know
that
not
the
way
we
work
our
people
always
come
first
keep
thinking
that
way
it
an
inspiring
concept
okay
we
review
procedures
and
wait
to
hear
from
you
that
all
for
now
roger
have
fun
he
sighed
up
ahead
through
the
dark
rain
loomed
the
rugged
atoll
of
an
island
it
was
not
large
enough
to
have
any
vegetation
it
really
was
only
a
giant
granite
outcropping
that
nearly
disappeared
every
time
a
breaker
washed
over
it
this
pierre
reflected
with
chagrin
is
going
to
be
our
staging
area
as
well
as
our
new
home
for
a
full
day
a
little
camouflage
would
handle
the
problem
of
detection
by
any
snooping
usn
flyovers
but
the
boys
were
going
to
get
much
sleep
this
is
a
hell
of
a
deployment
base
reggie
was
saying
his
voice
barely
audible
over
the
sputter
of
the
two
boards
the
two
black
zodiac
rafts
were
now
side
by
side
keeping
together
his
normally
florid
complexion
had
turned
even
more
deeply
ruddy
from
the
cold
and
frustration
how
in
bloody
hell
did
it
come
to
this
armont
was
so
frustrated
he
could
barely
manage
a
civil
answer
it
came
to
this
because
we
let
a
client
spec
a
job
we
left
a
piece
of
security
to
the
client
always
a
bad
idea
he
climbed
over
the
side
of
the
zodiac
splashing
through
the
surf
and
began
securing
the
first
line
to
a
jagged
outcropping
around
them
the
cold
waves
of
the
aegean
lapped
through
the
rain
dawn
was
hours
away
and
there
was
nothing
to
do
now
except
recriminate
dimitri
spiros
who
had
installed
the
security
system
for
the
satcom
facility
waded
ashore
looking
as
sheepish
as
he
felt
he
had
only
himself
to
blame
for
the
penetration
he
knew
and
he
had
no
intention
of
trying
to
defend
it
now
what
can
i
say
he
grimaced
and
caught
the
line
hans
was
tossing
to
him
i
should
have
put
my
foot
down
sometimes
pleasing
the
client
up
front
means
not
pleasing
him
at
the
end
if
something
goes
wrong
always
your
fault
not
his
human
nature
i
did
listen
to
my
own
better
judgment
bates
claimed
they
had
enough
security
and
i
let
him
get
away
with
it
it
in
the
past
now
armont
said
biting
his
tongue
we
all
keep
learning
from
our

as
long

the
education
does
get
too
expensive
hans
was
setting
up
the
camouflage
that
would
cover
them
during
the
daylight
hours
to
come
they
had
prepared
for
most
contingencies
and
had
brought
enough
camouflage
netting
to
cover
them
and
the
rafts
which
they
now
had
dragged
onto
the
atoll
to
serve
as
beds
they
would
take
turns
sleeping
letting
whoever
felt
like
it
grab
a
few
winks
now
armont
was
staring
into
the
dark
sky
thinking
thinking
there
must
be
a
better
way
to
pay
for
your
caviar
chapter
thirteen
we
on
our
own
vance
said
clicking
off
the
mike
and
looking
around
the
darkened
blockhouse
marooned
cally
who
had
been
listening
to
the
radio
exchange
already
had
other
things
to
think
about
she
was
engaged
by
the
computer
terminal
checking
out
the
status
of
the
facility
hate
to
tell
you
this
but
it
worse
than
you
know
she
was
staring
at
the
screen
they
taken
over
the
fujitsu
they
locked
out
all
the
other
workstations
and
there
a
countdown
in
process
look
somebody
on
big
benny
who
knows
all
about
sort
about
sort
sort
the
program
that
sets
up
the
automatic
sequence
once
it
started
it
proceeds
like
clockwork
the
cyclops
comes
up
to
power
the
radars
are
all
switched
on
and
the
vehicle
electronics
go
to
full
alert
status
the
main
console
in
command
controls
everything
and
nothing
can
prevent
the
launch
from
proceeding
unless
it
stopped
from
there
how
long
have
we
got
it
in
the
abbreviated
mode
that
a
countdown
he
looked
at
her
so
you
saying
we
got
roughly
six
hours
to
get
down
there
and
stop
it
six
hours
on
the
nose
how
about
your
friend
georges
he
logged
off
the
computer
like
i
said
it
somebody
else
they
must
have
brought
along
their
own
specialist
guess
they
came
prepared
one
more
problem
vance
observed
with
a
sigh
first
ramirez
and
then
this
one
guess
we
have
to
neutralize
him
too
if
that
the
only
way
to
stop
the
launch
this
is
getting
dirtier
all
the
time
there
no
way
to
do
it
except
get
into
command
cally
went
on
but
even
then
shutting
it
down
not
that
simple
once
it
goes
into
auto
mode
you
ca
just
flip
a
switch
but
still
that
the
only
place
you
talking
about
a
frontal
assault
that
could
get
bloody
vance
said
they
might
kill
more
of
your
technicians
no
the
assault
will
have
to
wait
for
arm
we
going
to
need
to
work
a
different
way
he
paused
maybe
it
time
we
blew
up
something
you
mean
what
the
definition
of
a
terrorist
it
somebody
who
uses
placed
acts
of
violence
to
disrupt
society
normal
functions
right
murder
one
and
frighten
a
thousand
a
terrorist
is
somebody
who
takes
on
a
more
powerful
organization
by
tactics
scaring
them
so
she
looked
at
him
quizzically
her
dark
eyes
puzzled
well
they
taken
over
the
facility
now
which
means
they
the
establishment
and
we
the
outsiders
the
tables
are
turned
which
means
we
have
to
become
terrorists
against
them
but
we
do
have
much
to
work
with
so
we
going
to
have
to
do
some
improvising
he
turned
thoughtful
scratching
at
his
chin
how
about
some
throw
together
some
gasoline
sulfuric
acid
sugar
and
maybe
a
little
potassium
chlorate
for
ignition
mollys
you
mean
molotov
cocktails
and
if
you
design
them
for
acid
ignition
then
you
can
blow
them
with
a
bullet
not
a
bad
little
standoff
bomb
i
not
so
keen
on
blowing
up
equipment
it
hard
enough
to
get
things
to
work
around
here
when
we
try
ditto
the
cables
i
suppose
that
would
be
even
worse
we
be
down
for
months
okay
nothing
crucial
he
strolled
to
the
open
doorway
and
looked
down
the
hill
pondering
we
just
need
to
put
something
out
of
commission
that
could
be
fixed
easily
later
on
and
you
know
what
i
think
i
see
the
perfect
target
what
are
you
talking
about
she
rose
stepped
over
and
followed
his
gaze
right
down
there
that
gantry
it
the
only
way
to
prep
the
satellite
payload
right
maybe
we
could
take
that
out
it
would
keep
them
from
installing
a
bomb
put
them
out
of
business
without
damaging
the
vehicle
nothing
serious
they
wo
be
able
to
use
it
but
you
can
put
it
back
into
operating
condition
in
a
couple
of
days
with
the
right
parts
think
that
possible
she
seemed
disposed
to
the
concept
though
still
none
too
keen
okay
but
i
got
a
better
idea
how
about
just
blowing
up
a
portion
of
the
rails
it
moves
on
then
they
could
roll
it
away
from
the
vehicle
to
launch
sounds
intelligent
to
me
but
i
got
a
hunch
we
better
not
wait
too
long
he
was
feeling
energized
after
the
steak
matter
of
fact
i
say
there
no
time
like
the
present
where
can
we
find
some
chemicals
even
the
kitchen
would
be
a
place
to
start
i
got
a
better
idea
she
interjected
there
a
construction
shed
it
might
have
something
left
from
back
when
then
why
do
we
go
down
and
have
a
look
he
mused
figure
out
if
there
anything
we
can
liberate
that
fine
with
me
she
sighed
not
sounding
as
though
she
meant
it
all
we
have
to
do
is
manage
to
get
down
there
without
being
spotted
and
killed
i
do
know
how
much
more
excitement
i
can
take
he
definitely
felt
out
of
control
human
prey
and
he
hated
every
minute
of
it
that
goes
for
me
too
but
she
was
already
switching
off
the
workstation
by
now
the
trek
down
the
hill
was
getting
to
be
all
too
familiar
the
bristly
greek
scrub
the
rough
outcroppings
some
night
birds
twittered
nervously
but
otherwise
only
their
labored
breathing
broke
the
silence
the
harshness
of
the
terrain
made
him
think
again
about
the
greek
character
ancient
and
modern
to
stand
up
to
a
land
like
this
you
had
to
be
tough
which
brought
his
thoughts
again
to
the
woman
by
his
side
once
in
a
while
you
ran
across
somebody
with
whom
you
absolutely
clicked
he
believed
in
love
at
first
sight
he
had
been
an
incorrigible
romantic
all
his
life
and
this
was
definitely
the
feeling
he
had
now
and
he
thought
well
hoped
she
felt
the
same
could
it
be
true
maybe
it
was
just
the
fact
they
were
working
together
they
were
both
willed
and
he
sensed
real
potential
for
friction
what
are
you
going
to
do
when
this
is
all
over
she
was
asking
a
wistful
tone
entering
her
voice
just
go
back
to
sailing
you
sound
as
though
you
already
assume
it
going
to
be
over
he
laughed
in
spite
of
himself
was
she
thinking
the
same
thing
i
admire
your
optimism
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
if
we
live
through
this
i
hoping
to
try
my
trek
all
over
again
he
took
her
hand
as
they
navigated
the
stones
want
to
come
along
make
it
a
twosome
maybe
her
tone
said
she
was
intrigued
and
she
did
drop
his
hand
it
sounded
pretty
heroic
well
it
was
mainly
just
a
challenge
he
shrugged
continuing
on
down
the
dark
trail
calling
it
heroic
is
maybe
a
bit
much
no
way
her
voice
had
a
wonderful
finality
i
think
your
attempt
to
recreate
the
voyage
of
ulysses
was
a
heroic
undertaking
period
she
paused
you
know
maybe
i
should
tell
you
this
but
you
remind
me
an
awful
lot
of
somebody
i
used
to
know
who
that
his
name
does
matter
but
it
was
alan
harris
he
was
a
biochemistry
professor
tall
like
you
older
than
me
i
guess
i
made
a
fool
of
myself
over
him
looking
back
vance
did
know
quite
what
to
say
what
happened
what
do
you
think
happened
older
guy
smart
lovesick
student
looking
for
never
mind
when
i
think
about
it
i
do
know
whether
to
laugh
or
cry
then
her
mood
abruptly
changed
okay
the
construction
shed
is
right
over
there
she
was
pointing
through
the
dark
and
the
light
spatters
of
rain
that
had
suddenly
appeared
was
it
beginning
to
storm
again
it
always
locked
but
it
got
its
own
separate
computer
control
so
it
wo
be
shut
down
like
everything
else
all
anybody
has
to
do
to
get
in
is
just
to
code
in
a
requisition
how
we
keep
inventory
he
led
the
way
keeping
to
the
shadows
well
can
you
tell
it
to
sesame
and
let
us
in
she
nodded
then
entered
a
small
portico
next
to
the
entryway
there
on
a
terminal
she
typed
in
the
code
that
would
disconnect
the
heavy
electronic
locks
on
the
shed
door
moments
later
he
heard
a
click
and
watched
the
green
diodes
on
the
locks
start
to
glow
next
it
swung
open
and
the
fluorescent
lights
came
on
to
reveal
a
perfect
fabrication
shop
with
rows
of
precision
machine
tools
lined
up
in
neat
rows
the
floors
spotless
looking
around
he
wondered
what
kind
of
chemicals
he
could
scrounge
there
had
to
be
something
everything
checks
here
wolf
helling
said
looking
at
the
wide
board
of
lights
in
launch
control
pakis
went
up
on
the
elevator
and
wired
in
the
device
nobody
here
had
any
inkling
what
it
is
he
was
speaking
on
his
to
dore
peretz
who
was
still
operating
the
fujitsu
out
of
command
i
think
we
ready
you
d
better
roll
the
gantry
the
hell
back
away
from
the
vehicle
peretz
voice
barked
my
next
item
in
the
countdown
is
to
test
the
alignment
on
the
cyclops
make
sure
the
vehicle
is
receiving
power
okay
helling
replied
electronics
are
all
in
a
positive
state
of
mind
here
but
i
guess
you
ca
be
too
safe
by
the
way
everybody
doing
there
having
any
trouble
our
guests
are
getting
with
the
program
came
the
answer
i
even
got
an
engineer
friend
here
named
georges
who
going
to
be
a
great
help
when
the
time
comes
small
attitude
problem
but
nothing
i
manage
well
keep
them
all
frightened
it
the
best
way
i
get
started
with
the
rollback
should
only
take
a
few
minutes
go
for
it
dore
peretz
said
vance
felt
the
cold
steel
rails
glistening
lightly
in
the
thin
moonlight
and
wondered
how
long
it
would
take
to
set
the
charge
he
also
wondered
if
his
impromptu
bomb
would
work
as
planned
it
should
in
the
shop
cally
had
led
him
directly
to
a
cache
of
made
gelignite
left
over
from
the
days
of
excavation
he
had
shaped
a
diamond
charge
which
when
wrapped
around
a
rail
and
detonated
with
a
fuse
would
produce
shock
waves
that
would
meet
at
the
center
then
be
deflected
at
right
angles
shattering
the
metal
it
was
a
bomber
trick
one
he
learned
from
willem
voorst
that
usually
produced
total
deformation
and
fracture
he
had
insisted
that
she
let
him
handle
this
one
alone
claiming
there
was
no
need
to
endanger
two
people
and
finally
she
had
agreed
calypso
andros
she
had
already
proven
she
could
take
control
of
a
situation
like
the
one
up
the
mountain
and
handle
it
that
cool
would
come
in
handy
later
he
also
liked
her
new
york
street
smarts
yet
beneath
it
all
he
sensed
something
was
wrong
she
mentioned
some
guy
named
alan
then
clammed
up
funny
reminding
a
woman
of
some
old
boyfriend
could
be
a
mixed
blessing
sometimes
you
got
to
take
credit
for
the
other
failings
well
that
cuts
both
ways
admit
it
he
finally
lectured
himself
calypso
andros
reminds
you
of
eva
borodin
she
was
the
temperamental
slavic
beauty
who
had
been
the
love
on
and
off
of
his
life
that
was
the
bottom
line
he
still
wore
her
wedding
ring
he
had
loved
her
more
than
anything
and
after
she
left
he
had
tried
everything
he
could
think
of
to
help
forget
her
none
of
it
had
worked
even
now
here
the
thought
of
her
kept
coming
back
but
enough
concentrate
on
the
job
at
hand
and
get
going
quickly
he
began
securing
the
soft
explosive
although
his
instinct
still
was
just
to
blow
the
whole
gantry
and
have
done
with
it
he
agreed
with
cally
that
that
was
a
the
idea
was
sabotage
not
demolition
the
difference
might
not
be
all
that
subtle
but
there
was
a
difference
the
gantry
a
huge
derrick
on
wheels
was
illuminated
by
intensely
focused
floodlights
from
a
battery
across
from
the
vehicles
the
tracks
were
about
sixty
meters
long
which
suggested
the
distance
it
had
to
be
away
from
before
the
vehicle
could
lift
off
so
if
he
could
destroy
the
tracks
close
enough
the
gantry
would
be
stuck
in
place
making
a
launch
impossible
the
gelignite
should
do
it
he
told
himself
the
charge
was
going
to
wrap
almost
perfectly
around
the
rails
this
ought
to
be
a
snap
at
that
moment
he
felt
a
tremor
in
the
rails
and
looked
up
to
see
the
lights
on
the
gantry
flicker
as
its
motors
revved
to
life
then
it
started
rolling
like
a
monolith
slow
and
assured
it
began
inching
away
from
the
vehicle
and
toward
him
okay
it
moving
back
helling
said
i
guess
this
thing
suddenly
as
abruptly
as
it
had
begun
the
gantry
halted
its
steel
wheels
screeching
to
a
stop
along
the
tracks
what
happened
ramirez
eyes
narrowed
as
he
gazed
out
through
the
viewing
window
a
red
indicator
had
come
up
on
the
console
flashing
the
gantry
bathed
in
floodlights
was
just
standing
there
stubbornly
still
the
control
went
into
a
safety
mode
the
german
was
staring
at
the
console
according
to
the
lights
here
the
track
sensors
shut
it
down
maybe
the
rails
are
obstructed
good
safety
system
vance
thought
he
could
feel
them
now
beneath
the
explosive
electronic
sensors
on
the
tracks
a
thin
line
of
parallel
wires
held
by
insulators
had
detected
his
tampering
and
halted
the
gantry
wait
a
minute
he
suddenly
thought
maybe
i
do
have
to
blow
the
track
after
all
why
not
just
these
wires
and
let
the
thing
own
safety
system
shut
it
down
they
may
not
figure
out
for
hours
what
the
problem
is
with
a
grin
he
began
going
along
the
track
feeling
his
way
through
the
dark
as
he
twisted
the
parallel
safety
tripwires
together
every
few
feet
making
certain
they
shorted
well
we
do
have
time
to
tinker
with
it
now
ramirez
declared
feeling
his
pique
growing
there
only
a
problem
if
it
a
malfunction
of
the
motors
and
they
do
report
a
problem
he
pointed
down
to
the
console
so
just
switch
it
over
to
manual
helling
stirred
uneasily
i
not
sure
it
such
a
good
idea
to
override
the
safety
system
we
do
know
when
i
in
need
of
your
views
i
ask
for
them
ramirez
cut
him
off
now
go
to
manual
and
get
on
with
it
wolf
helling
was
a
but
only
when
he
knew
the
downside
if
the
gantry
motors
shut
down
he
figured
there
probably
was
a
reason
on
the
other
hand
the
first
device
already
had
been
loaded
onto
all
systems
checked
the
preflight
punch
lists
taken
care
of
maybe
it
was
better
to
go
ahead
and
keep
ramirez
mind
at
ease
rather
than
worry
too
much
about
the
technicalities
after
all
unanimity
was
as
important
as
perfection
if
you
say
so
he
declared
finally
but
it
risky
i
take
no
responsibility
for
this
he
flipped
the
gantry
control
motors
to
override
and
shoved
the
operating
lever
forward
outside
the
glass
partition
the
huge
gantry
again
began
to
inch
along
its
steel
tracks
moving
away
from
the
vehicle
see
ramirez
said
coldly
and
with
satisfaction
it
was
probably
a
malfunction
of
the
indicator
lights
we
do
have
time
to
troubleshoot
every
little
glitch
that
crops
up
now
increase
the
speed
and
let
get
on
with
it
wolf
helling
his
precise
prussian
mind
clicking
was
liking
recklessness
less
and
less
on
the
other
hand
he
knew
better
than
to
contradict
the
temperamental
south
american
he
hired
on
with
let
keep
the
speed
the
way
it
is
and
i
think
i
ought
to
go
out
and
check
the
track
just
to
be
sure
if
you
want
to
but
do
take
too
long
vance
felt
the
tracks
suddenly
shiver
then
with
what
sounded
like
a
painful
grind
of
metal
on
metal
the
gantry
started
moving
again
they
decided
to
override
the
safety
shutoff
okay
he
thought
back
to
the
original
plan
he
turned
and
retraced
his
steps
to
the
place
where
he
had
left
the
gelignite
feeling
along
the
track
until
his
fingers
touched
it
it
was
still
in
place
but
there
was
no
time
now
to
set
up
a
fuse
which
meant
there
was
only
one
other
way
to
blow
it
quickly
he
secured
the
patch
more
tightly
around
the
steel
then
looked
up
to
check
the
gantry
it
was
now
about
five
meters
away
its
wheels
inching
along
the
rails
with
a
ponderous
inevitability
as
its
electric
motors
hummed
he
pulled
out
his
sailor
tin
of
matches
and
withdrew
one
relieved
it
was
still
dry
he
scraped
the
match
across
the
bottom
of
the
can
and
it
flamed
in
the
dark
next
he
quickly
pressed
the
wooden
end
into
the
soft
gelignite
making
a
target
he
could
see
from
a
distance
after
checking
it
one
last
time
he
rose
and
dashed
for
the
safety
of
the
nearest
shed
pulling
the
uzi
from
his
belt
and
chambering
a
round
he
leaned
against
a
darkened
wall
and
took
careful
aim
on
the
gantry
was
only
a
meter
away
from
the
charge
when
he
finally
squeezed
off
a
round
it
kicked
up
a
spray
of
gravel
next
to
the
rails
the
small
stones
glistening
in
the
floodlights
like
small
shining
stars
as
they
erupted
slightly
to
the
left
of
where
he
had
placed
the
charge
damn
he
knew
the
match
could
be
seen
as
well
as
the
flare
of
the
uzi
but
maybe
nobody
was
watching
in
any
case
he
adjusted
his
aim
and
quickly
fired
again
but
this
time
he
had
moved
the
sight
too
far
to
the
right
again
the
gravel
splayed
another
sparkle
under
the
lights
but
once
more
nothing
happened
now
the
gantry
wheels
were
about
to
pass
directly
over
the
explosive
if
the
thing
was
going
to
be
immobilized
he
had
one
shot
left
he
took
careful
aim
and
squeezed
the
trigger
to
the
sound
of
a
dull
click
his
last
round
had
misfired
something
going
on
out
there
ramirez
yelled
grabbing
arm
i
saw
flashes
of
light
somebody
shooting
see
it
over
there
he
was
pointing
that
exactly
why
i
wanted
to
check
it
out
at
last
helling
thought
maybe
now
he
listen
to
reason
look
i
going
to
shut
this
damned
thing
down
right
now
till
we
know
what
going
on
he
hit
the
control
and
applied
the
brakes
he
had
just
squandered
his
last
rounds
and
his
chance
to
cripple
the
gantry
he
sighed
involuntarily
la
at
that
instant
however
whoever
was
manning
the
controls
locked
the
wheels
and
there
was
the
loud
screech
of
metal
on
metal
he
watched
the
wheels
slide
across
the
patch
of
gelignite
creating
instantaneous
frictional
heat
immediately
a
blinding
white
flare
erupted
from
the
tracks
followed
by
the
loud
crack
of
an
explosion
he
watched
as
the
first
steel
wheel
was
sheared
away
and
the
gantry
lurched
awkwardly
forward
next
the
axle
ground
into
the
gravel
next
to
the
track
as
the
motion
of
the
giant
tower
tilted
it
askew
it
had
not
toppled
over
but
it
was
leaning
dangerously
whatever
might
be
required
to
repair
it
the
gantry
was
no
longer
functional
satcom
was
shut
down
for
the
foreseeable
he
was
less
than
happy
with
his
handiwork
cally
going
to
kill
me
that
was
his
first
thought
after
her
long
diatribe
about
not
doing
any
big
damage
then
he
watched
as
it
got
worse
the
gantry
jerked
again
as
the
axle
cracked
from
the
stress
and
began
slowly
to
heel
like
the
slow
crash
of
a
tumbling
redwood
he
almost
wanted
to
shout
timberrrr
it
toppled
forward
landing
with
an
enormous
crash
that
shook
the
very
ground
around
him
and
lights
splintered
into
the
soil
that
separated
the
launch
pad
from
the
rest
of
the
facility
now
the
gantry
lay
like
a
fallen
giant
as
he
watched
he
slowly
recognized
he
had
achieved
nothing
but
malicious
damage
by
collapsing
the
gantry
was
now
out
of
the
way
below
the
sight
lines
between
the
cyclops
system
on
the
mountain
and
the
vehicle
they
still
could
launch
must
already
be
armed
he
realized
the
bomb
is
aboard
and
set
to
fly
goddammit
i
warned
you
it
was
a
mistake
helling
exploded
still
stunned
by
the
view
out
the
window
the
gantry
had
just
heeled
over
and
collapsed
onto
the
track
at
least
it
fell
out
of
the
way
bamirez
declared
calmly
no
problem
he
cursed
himself
for
not
taking
helling
advice
for
once
the
german
had
been
right
nothing
changed
we
launch
on
schedule
but
right
now
we
have
some
unfinished
business
what
that
bastard
from
up
on
the
mountain
he
had
to
be
the
one
responsible
i
know
it
was
him
i
can
smell
it
he
drew
out
his
beretta
and
clicked
off
the
safety
then
angrily
motioned
for
helling
and
headed
out
the
door
come
on
let
get
the
son
of
a
bitch
going
to
kill
him
personally
now
what
vance
rose
and
started
walking
toward
an
opening
he
saw
that
led
into
the
underground
launch
facility
maybe
he
was
thinking
he
could
slip
into
launch
control
and
somehow
sabotage
the
vehicle
itself
a
dark
tunnel
branched
off
on
his
right
the
lights
were
off
so
he
probably
could
go
directly
okay
he
thought
assume
one
of
the
bombs
must
already
be
installed
on
the
first
vehicle
and
ready
for
launch
but
given
all
the
krytron
detonators
the
pakistani
had
there
could
well
be
more
maybe
you
should
try
and
find
them
see
what
you
can
learn
could
there
be
a
way
to
disable
the
weapon
now
poised
up
there
without
having
to
reach
it
maybe
disarm
it
electronically
he
tried
to
guess
what
the
firing
mechanism
could
be
clearly
if
you
were
planning
to
deliver
a
nuke
you
were
going
to
need
some
way
to
control
the
detonation
so
how
did
it
work
maybe
a
pressure
apparatus
that
could
blow
it
on
the
way
down
during
the
reentry
phase
why
not
as
the
vehicle
encountered
denser
and
denser
atmosphere
pressure
could
activate
a
switch
that
sensed
the
altitude
and
instigated
detonation
at
a
preprogrammed
height
or
another
possibility
was
a
device
connected
to
the
guidance
system
in
the
computer
that
would
be
trickier
but
it
might
ultimately
be
more
reliable
it
also
might
be
easier
to
abort
in
fact
the
whole
thing
might
be
doable
from
here
on
the
ground
but
what
if
he
got
caught
his
uzi
was
empty
cally
had
his
walther
and
nothing
now
stood
between
him
and
the
terrorists
except
his
own
bad
luck
as
he
edged
into
the
darkened
tunnel
he
felt
the
coolness
envelop
him
the
whole
operation
now
felt
as
though
it
were
in
a
shroud
he
was
almost
at
the
end
when
he
heard
the
steel
door
behind
him
slam
shut
he
whirled
to
look
but
nothing
betrayed
any
sign
of
life
instead
there
was
only
stony
silence
punctuated
by
the
mechanical
hum
of
the
facility
underground
environmental
control
system
but
as
he
turned
back
two
figures
stood
in
the
doorway
ahead
oh
shit
he
hit
the
floor
just
as
it
started
a
ricochet
of
bullets
slapping
around
him
then
as
abruptly
as
the
fusillade
had
begun
it
stopped
he
was
so
astonished
to
still
be
alive
he
barely
heard
the
voice
from
the
smoky
doorway
cut
through
the
sudden
silence
then
it
registered
accent
and
all
is
that
you
my
friend
a
pause
you
are
like
the
cat
with
nine
lives
and
until
a
second
ago
you
had
used
only
eight
i
assume
your
ninth
got
you
through
my
colleagues
burst
of
impetuosity
just
now
but
i
want
to
see
you
before
i
kill
you
your
counting
system
needs
work
vance
said
still
in
shock
he
gingerly
pulled
himself
up
off
the
floor
fully
expecting
to
be
shot
then
and
there
the
thought
made
him
giddy
feeling
like
a
zen
master
living
as
though
already
dead
i
got
eight
and
a
half
left
so
it
is
you
the
accent
was
unmistakable
do
make
me
sorry
i
did
let
wolf
here
finish
you
just
now
however
this
matter
is
personal
i
want
the
satisfaction
of
doing
it
myself
vance
stepped
into
the
light
sabri
ramirez
i
ca
really
say
it
a
pleasure
to
meet
you
the
giddy
feeling
was
growing
i
feel
like
going
to
need
a
shower
just
being
in
the
same
space
ramirez
stared
at
him
startled
how
do
you
know
who
i
am
i
bet
half
the
bozos
who
came
with
you
do
know
do
they
vance
looked
him
over
feeling
his
life
come
back
stand
up
and
take
it
like
a
man
back
from
the
dead
it
a
miracle
yes
i
am
back
but
you
soon
will
be
entering
that
condition
and
i
doubt
very
much
you
will
be
returning
vance
mind
flashed
a
picture
of
ramirez
strafing
the
navy
frigate
shooting
the
satcom
technician
not
to
mention
he
was
planning
to
detonate
a
nuclear
device
somewhere
in
the
world
not
a
man
given
to
idle
threats
he
was
also
known
to
love
torture
part
of
his
personal
touch
incidentally
ramirez
went
on
perhaps
you
should
pass
me
that
uzi
i
assume
the
clip
is
empty
but
it
liable
to
make
my
friend
wolf
here
nervous
would
want
that
would
we
vance
handed
it
over
metal
stock
first
thank
you
ramirez
took
it
and
tossed
it
to
the
emaciated
balding
man
standing
next
to
him
by
the
way
you
know
my
name
but
i
still
do
not
know
yours
vance
mike
vance
why
not
tell
him
he
thought
it
hardly
matters
now
vance
that
name
rings
a
bell
from
somewhere
the
thoughtful
look
turned
slowly
to
a
smile
ah
yes
as
i
recall
you
work
for
arm
he
paused
the
smile
vanishing
as
he
mentioned
the
name
so
tell
me
are
they
planning
to
try
to
meddle
here
that
would
be
a
big
mistake
vance
i
can
assure
you
more
bad
news
vance
thought
ramirez
is
no
fool
he
must
have
known
we
did
the
security
for
this
place
i
got
a
feeling
they
going
to
be
interested
in
what
happens
to
me
if
that
what
you
mean
ramirez
moved
closer
looking
squarely
in
his
face
you
know
the
eyes
of
a
man
always
tell
more
about
him
than
any
words
he
can
say
and
your
eyes
give
you
away
you
lying
and
you
scared
he
stepped
back
and
smiled
and
i
tell
you
something
vance
continued
meeting
his
stare
when
i
look
in
your
eyes
i
do
see
anything
but
even
a
hyena
can
know
fear
your
time
will
come
it
was
pointless
bravado
but
it
felt
good
to
say
it
we
see
who
can
know
fear
ramirez
scowled
angrily
at
the
use
of
the
nickname
he
hated
we
will
also
learn
something
about
your
tolerance
for
pain
vance
in
very
short
order
you
are
not
very
popular
with
some
of
my
men
they
not
very
popular
with
me
the
defiance
just
kept
coming
he
was
sure
from
where
and
i
got
some
other
news
for
you
about
to
find
out
that
andikythera
is
a
very
small
vulnerable
objective
you
persist
in
trying
to
antagonize
me
vance
i
could
easily
have
had
you
killed
just
now
and
spared
myself
this
pointless
interview
why
did
you
the
giddy
feeling
was
coming
back
i
wanted
to
show
you
how
stupid
you
really
are
he
right
about
that
vance
told
himself
i
think
i
just
proved
it
but
your
nine
lives
have
run
out
i
afraid
i
no
longer
interested
in
this
conversation
he
turned
away
and
motioned
for
wolf
helling
let
me
just
shoot
him
and
get
it
over
with
the
german
said
not
just
yet
ramirez
replied
after
a
moment
thought
no
i
think
would
enjoy
softening
him
up
first
president
the
voice
said
have
you
made
your
decision
yet
john
hansen
felt
his
anger
growing
the
voice
on
the
other
end
of
the
phone
exuded
the
of
a
man
who
was
holding
something
unspeakably
horrible
over
your
head
either
he
could
bluff
with
the
best
of
them
or
he
knew
exactly
what
he
was
doing
which
was
it
he
looked
over
at
theodore
brock
who
had
been
at
his
desk
just
down
from
the
oval
office
early
arranging
for
the
wire
transfers
of
the
funds
to
geneva
the
eight
hundred
million
dollars
had
been
placed
in
a
numbered
account
in
a
branch
of
the
union
bank
of
switzerland
just
in
case
the
objective
however
was
never
to
take
the
final
step
and
transfer
it
into
the
accounts
the
terrorist
had
designated
in
banco
ambrosiano
brock
now
sat
on
the
couch
across
fiddling
with
his
glasses
a
cup
of
coffee
sat
next
to
him
untouched
we
accepted
your
proposal
in
principle
hansen
replied
nervously
drumming
his
fingertips
on
the
desk
he
scarcely
could
believe
the
words
were
emerging
from
his
mouth
we
have
some
conditions
of
our
own
concerning
the
hostages
but
i
think
it
possible
to
come
to
terms
given
time
arrangements
are
being
made
concerning
the
money
according
to
the
procedures
i
faxed
you
the
voice
asked
not
entirely
hansen
went
on
beginning
what
was
going
to
be
his
own
gamble
the
funds
will
have
to
be
handled
through
our
embassy
in
switzerland
it
may
take
a
few
days
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
on
the
other
end
then
you
do
have
a
few
days
president
time
has
run
out
you
have
to
make
a
decision
either
you
honor
our
demands
or
you
must
be
prepared
to
accept
the
consequences
and
i
assure
you
they
are
terrible
which
will
it
be
it
is
going
to
be
neither
hansen
replied
coolly
sensing
he
still
had
leverage
it
is
in
both
our
interests
to
satisfy
our
objectives
including
the
safety
of
the
hostages
on
the
island
if
we
have
to
work
together
to
accomplish
that
then
we
should
it
the
logical
rational
way
to
proceed
president
this
world
is
neither
logical
nor
rational
came
back
the
voice
now
noticeably
harder
the
timetable
does
not
allow
latitude
for
delays
you
let
me
put
it
like
this
hansen
interjected
trying
to
catch
him
off
balance
you
have
the
choice
of
doing
it
the
way
it
can
be
done
or
not
doing
it
at
all
which
do
you
want
it
to
be
i
given
you
an
ultimatum
the
voice
replied
tersely
its
sense
of
control
returning
the
only
question
left
is
whether
or
not
you
intend
to
honor
it
hansen
stole
a
glance
at
his
wristwatch
thinking
he
needed
to
stall
for
time
but
clearly
it
was
going
to
be
so
easy
the
special
forces
had
reached
souda
bay
but
they
would
not
be
in
position
to
begin
an
assault
for
several
more
hours
i
told
you
i
working
on
it
he
said
finally
these
things
take
the
funds
can
be
in
minutes
to
the
geneva
accounts
i
listed
for
you
the
voice
was
growing
cocky
there
no
need
for
brown
paper
bags
and
unmarked
bills
hansen
suddenly
felt
his
anger
boil
his
composure
going
sometimes
it
was
better
to
go
with
your
gut
than
with
your
head
then
the
scenario
could
be
played
out
on
your
own
terms
the
hell
with
this
bastard
why
not
just
call
his
bluff
he
was
going
to
use
the
weapon
or
weapons
even
if
he
had
them
he
would
gain
nothing
by
that
the
threat
of
using
a
bomb
was
his
only
bargaining
chip
you
know
he
said
i
thinking
maybe
i
do
want
to
play
your
game
at
all
that
is
a
serious
error
in
judgment
president
i
am
not
playing
games
as
far
as
i
concerned
you
are
hansen
looked
up
to
see
alicia
ushering
ed
briggs
into
the
office
god
he
thought
do
i
look
as
haggard
as
he
does
i
offering
you
a
deal
his
attention
snapped
back
to
the
phone
and
he
continued
give
me
another
day
to
arrange
for
the
money
another
hours
that
the
best
you
going
to
get
we
both
know
that
is
a
lie
came
back
the
voice
if
you
expect
me
to
accept
that
you
are
an
even
bigger
fool
than
i
imagined
since
you
do
appear
to
believe
my
seriousness
the
time
has
come
for
a
demonstration
i
waiting
the
chances
of
you
delivering
a
nuke
which
is
what
i
assume
you
have
are
about
the
same
as
washington
being
hit
by
a
meteorite
the
odds
are
a
lot
better
that
you
just
blow
yourself
up
criminals
like
you
are
long
on
tough
talk
and
short
on
technology
this
conversation
is
getting
us
nowhere
so
just
to
make
sure
we
understand
each
other
let
me
repeat
the
terms
once
again
the
eight
hundred
million
must
be
wired
to
the
accounts
i
listed
at
the
geneva
branch
of
banco
ambrosiano
within
the
next
five
hours
if
it
is
not
the
consequences
will
be
more
terrible
than
i
hope
you
are
capable
of
imagining
the
loss
of
life
and
property
will
be
staggering
keep
him
talking
briggs
whispered
across
keep
a
line
open
dialogue
the
fucker
till
hansen
cleared
his
throat
and
nodded
look
if
you
just
hold
off
a
few
more
hours
maybe
something
can
be
done
about
the
problems
with
the
money
you
have
to
try
and
understand
it
not
that
easy
his
voice
trailed
into
silence
and
he
looked
up
the
bastard
cut
the
line
ed
he
gone
he
cradled
the
hand
piece
shit
will
the
son
of
a
bitch
be
ruthless
enough
to
use
one
of
those
nukes
he
was
wondering
you
ca
really
know
he
answered
himself
with
a
lunatic
you
damned
well
never
know
bill
bates
was
still
in
his
office
trying
to
do
some
heavy
thinking
and
put
his
problems
into
sequential
order
the
first
problem
was
that
the
bastards
were
killing
his
people
mostly
just
to
make
an
example
and
instill
terror
the
next
one
he
was
so
sure
about
but
from
what
he
had
seen
in
his
occasional
glimpses
of
control
cally
was
missing
apparently
she
had
gone
off
with
the
fucker
who
called
himself
number
one
and
had
come
back
was
she
down
at
launch
doing
what
well
calypso
andros
was
a
tough
cookie
they
might
pressure
her
and
threaten
her
but
she
would
stand
up
to
them
these
terrorists
were
just
cowards
with
automatics
he
could
smell
that
much
a
mile
away
the
next
problem
was
satcom
itself
he
hated
to
find
himself
thinking
about
it
at
a
time
like
this
but
the
company
was
built
on
a
pyramid
of
debt
construction
loans
that
could
be
rolled
over
and
converted
to
obligations
only
if
the
test
launch
proceeded
as
scheduled
it
already
had
been
postponed
once
and
the
banks
were
getting
nervous
if
these
thugs
derailed
the
cyclops
for
any
length
of
time
the
banks
were
going
to
move
in
and
try
to
foreclose
on
all
the
computers
and
equipment
the
litigation
would
stretch
into
the
next
century
satcom
on
the
brink
all
the
way
but
what
a
dream
almost
there
and
now
this
he
found
himself
thinking
about
his
wife
dorothy
she
had
been
supportive
she
always
was
from
the
very
first
maybe
after
eighteen
years
of
struggle
she
had
had
misgivings
about
gambling
everything
on
this
one
big
turn
of
the
roulette
wheel
but
she
had
kept
her
thoughts
to
herself
which
was
only
one
more
reason
why
he
loved
her
so
she
had
been
all
their
married
life
always
there
with
a
real
smile
and
a
hug
when
the
going
got
the
roughest
it
made
all
the
difference
but
now
now
that
the
whole
enterprise
was
in
danger
of
going
down
the
tubes
he
felt
he
had
let
her
down
for
the
first
time
ever
even
his
briar
pipe
tasted
burned
out
like
ashes
he
had
taken
every
cent
he
could
beg
or
borrow
and
had
gambled
it
all
on
space
only
to
have
a
group
of
monsters
barge
in
and
wreck
everything
now
what
he
honestly
did
know
he
had
flown
an
intruder
in
vietnam
but
with
terrorists
was
something
else
entirely
the
bastards
had
shut
down
all
the
communications
gear
when
they
moved
in
the
phones
were
out
the
radio
and
even
his
personal
computer
terminals
had
been
shunted
out
of
the
system
he
could
count
and
he
knew
what
automatic
weapons
could
do
no
this
one
was
out
of
his
control
he
glanced
around
his
office
paneled
in
light
woods
and
hung
with
photographs
of
dorothy
and
the
two
boys
his
favorite
was
during
a
regatta
in
chesapeake
bay
there
also
were
photos
of
the
cyclops
system
and
the
vehicle
the
latter
caught
in
the
austere
light
of
sunrise
the
blue
aegean
in
the
background
he
shook
his
head
sadly
rose
and
made
his
way
out
into
the
cavernous
room
that
was
command
the
fluorescent
lights
glared
down
on
a
depressing
sight
the
staff
disheveled
and
living
in
stark
fear
one
armed
hood
at
the
computer
another
lounging
by
the
doorway
georges
lefarge
looked
up
to
see
bates
coming
out
of
his
office
and
into
the
wide
expanse
that
was
command
he
assumed
the
ceo
had
been
sitting
moodily
in
his
office
dwelling
on
the
imminent
foreclosure
of
satcom
creditors
he
must
have
been
puffing
up
a
storm
on
his
pipe
because
a
cloud
of
smoke
poured
out
after
him
and
he
looked
weary
his
eyes
told
it
nobody
down
at
launch
control
knew
they
had
been
taken
over
by
terrorists
peretz
had
carefully
made
sure
that
all
communications
from
command
were
monitored
and
controlled
number
one
had
gone
down
there
but
he
apparently
had
managed
to
fool
everybody
into
thinking
he
and
all
his
hoods
were
satcom
consultants
one
thing
you
had
to
say
for
them
they
were
masters
of
deceit
number
one
could
pass
for
a
powered
european
executive
and
he
was
playing
the
authority
thing
to
the
hilt
are
you
bastards
having
fun
bates
walked
over
and
addressed
dore
peretz
the
israeli
looked
up
and
grinned
more
than
that
we
making
history
fasten
your
seat
belt
your
first
test
launch
is
going
to
be
a
real
a
this
facility
does
need
any
more
as
you
put
it
pal
bates
looked
him
over
with
contempt
we
were
doing
just
fine
before
you
barged
in
live
a
little
baby
peretz
beamed
back
lie
back
and
enjoy
it
let
me
break
some
news
to
you
chum
this
organization
is
going
to
just
roll
over
and
give
you
the
store
now
i
want
to
talk
to
that
greaseball
who
calls
himself
number
one
it
time
we
got
some
consideration
for
my
people
here
they
need
food
and
they
need
to
be
rotated
so
they
can
get
some
rest
there
going
to
be
hell
to
pay
and
in
short
order
i
can
guarantee
it
hey
man
ease
up
peretz
leaned
back
then
rotated
away
from
the
console
everybody
okay
do
start
getting
heavy
we
just
about
ready
to
party
right
bates
walked
past
headed
for
the
door
i
want
to
see
what
you
fuckers
have
done
to
my
people
down
at
launch
i
going
over
there
you
not
going
anywhere
asshole
peretz
declared
so
just
sit
down
and
make
yourself
comfortable
he
turned
and
signaled
the
iranian
lounging
at
the
door
barking
something
to
him
in
farsi
the
man
was
carrying
his
uzi
by
the
strap
almost
as
though
it
were
a
toy
but
in
a
second
he
clicked
to
attention
brought
it
up
and
chambered
a
round
bates
glared
at
him
then
turned
away
knowing
when
he
was
licked
he
might
try
and
take
the
bastard
but
it
probably
was
worth
the
risk
not
yet
the
time
would
come
chapter
fourteen
isaac
wake
up
she
shook
him
trying
to
be
as
quiet
as
possible
outside
a
new
storm
was
building
but
the
large
barracks
room
in
level
three
of
the
bates
motel
was
dark
and
deserted
with
the
staff
all
now
mobilized
for
the
upcoming
launch
god
i
found
you
his
eyelids
fluttered
and
then
he
slowly
raised
up
and
gazed
at
her
his
look
still
somewhere
between
sleep
and
waking
he
seemed
to
be
in
a
or
torpor
what
cally
is
that
you
isaac
there
been
a
disaster
i
do
know
where
bill
is
but
the
gantry
been
destroyed
he
blew
it
up
jesus
when
i
told
him
to
be
careful
and
cally
he
finally
managed
to
focus
on
her
presence
then
he
looked
around
what
going
on
where
everybody
down
at
launch
she
interjected
impatiently
hoods
have
taken
over
the
cyclops
and
they
started
a
countdown
i
want
to
get
you
out
of
here
and
then
try
to
radio
someone
now
what
what
are
you
talking
about
he
was
still
staring
at
her
groggily
radio
who
the
people
who
set
up
the
original
security
system
they
arm
they
coming
in
to
get
rid
of
these
hoodlums
well
good
luck
but
the
man
who
saved
me
what
was
his
name
he
mentioned
something
about
it
then
he
disappeared
i
do
that
who
blew
up
the
gantry
his
name
is
vance
she
quickly
recounted
the
story
i
told
him
not
to
blow
it
up
but
he
listen
all
he
accomplished
was
to
make
things
worse
she
was
so
outraged
she
could
barely
speak
the
idiot
the
mannheim
mind
seemed
to
be
clearing
a
countdown
but
why
would
georges
he
is
involved
at
least
i
do
think
so
he
been
replaced
by
one
of
their
people
they
taken
over
big
benny
somebody
who
knows
how
to
run
sort
mannheim
exhaled
then
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
it
gets
worse
not
only
is
the
gantry
gone
but
i
afraid
taken
mike
prisoner
mike
he
was
still
trying
to
get
his
bearings
vance
she
was
suddenly
embarrassed
by
the
implied
familiarity
isaac
she
noted
had
missed
it
and
he
raised
an
eyebrow
look
she
continued
he
may
be
dead
by
now
who
knows
but
i
want
to
get
you
out
of
here
and
then
try
to
raise
arm
on
the
radio
they
were
going
to
delay
everything
for
a
day
but
now
they
got
to
get
in
here
and
stop
the
launch
she
paused
shaking
from
the
strain
isaac
i
not
as
strong
as
i
thought
i
was
her
voice
quavered
i
scared
to
death
for
you
for
bill
for
georges
for
mike
for
all
of
us
even
worse
i
scared
for
the
world
what
do
you
mean
he
was
finally
coming
alive
with
a
faint
groan
he
rubbed
his
glassy
eyes
and
brushed
back
his
mane
of
white
hair
i
got
a
sneaking
suspicion
that
those
bastards
have
put
a
nuclear
weapon
in
the
payload
bay
of
good
god
and
now
you
say
the
gantry
is
gone
how
will
we
get
it
down
look
let
not
worry
about
that
part
just
yet
we
just
have
to
stop
them
from
going
through
with
the
countdown
we
can
disarm
the
bomb
later
all
right
then
he
was
on
the
side
of
his
bed
searching
for
his
shoes
get
me
out
of
here
she
led
him
out
into
the
darkened
hallway
the
separate
rooms
were
all
locked
giving
no
clue
who
was
still
around
where
was
the
satcom
security
staff
she
suddenly
wondered
were
they
locked
up
in
their
own
safe
little
enclave
somewhere
wherever
they
were
they
would
be
any
help
now
they
undoubtedly
were
unarmed
and
demoralized
with
a
sigh
she
pushed
open
the
door
and
they
stepped
out
into
the
storm
wind
was
tearing
across
the
island
bringing
with
it
the
taste
of
the
aegean
pungent
and
raw
it
felt
cool
a
refreshing
purge
after
the
stuffiness
of
the
bates
motel
the
rain
lashed
their
faces
cleansing
away
some
of
the
feeling
of
the
nightmare
and
she
knew
that
the
few
wild
goats
that
had
not
been
captured
and
removed
would
now
be
huddled
in
the
lee
behind
a
granite
ledge
they
liked
bleating
plaintively
there
was
a
wildness
a
freeness
about
andikythera
as
the
winds
tore
across
and
through
the
granite
outcroppings
and
the
sea
churned
against
the
timeless
rocks
of
the
shore
that
made
it
feel
like
nowhere
else
on
earth
get
practical
she
ordered
herself
forget
the
romance
the
storm
would
probably
be
over
well
before
morning
but
in
the
meantime
it
would
just
make
things
that
much
harder
for
arm
to
reach
the
island
if
they
made
it
at
all
it
would
be
around
dawn
just
in
time
to
watch
the
launch
damn
vance
somebody
on
the
frequency
hans
declared
abruptly
the
arm
team
had
been
settled
in
for
just
slightly
over
an
hour
trying
to
keep
plastic
sheets
over
them
to
ward
off
the
rain
as
they
attempted
to
alternate
taking
naps
however
in
spite
of
the
weather
he
had
kept
open
the
frequency
vance
had
been
using
just
in
case
up
until
now
it
had
been
a
continuous
hiss
of
empty
static
what
the
hell
armont
pulled
back
the
plastic
wiped
the
rain
from
his
eyes
and
lifted
a
questioning
eyebrow
around
them
the
dark
aegean
churned
against
their
granite
islet
vance
crazy
to
be
on
the
radio
now
he
better
have
a
blasted
good
reason
it
not
him
it
sounds
like
a
woman
hans
had
a
puzzled
look
on
his
face
as
he
handed
pierre
the
headset
shielding
it
haphazardly
from
the
rain
he
mentioned
something
about
a
woman
when
we
talked
yesterday
spiros
said
snapping
out
of
his
morose
reverie
maybe
it
the
same
one
she
was
with
him
then
well
whatever
going
on
i
think
we
all
should
hear
this
armont
unplugged
the
headphones
from
the
radio
then
turned
up
the
volume
the
better
to
overcome
the
rain
and
roar
of
surf
sirene
do
you
read
me
the
voice
was
saying
oh
god
please
answer
i
copy
spiros
said
into
the
microphone
he
was
as
puzzled
and
troubled
by
this
development
as
by
all
the
rest
who
the
hell
is
this
thank
god
came
back
the
voice
you
ca
wait
you
got
to
come
in
now
i
repeat
spiros
spoke
again
you
must
identify
yourself
otherwise
i
will
shut
down
this
frequency
they
started
a
countdown
they
plan
a
launch
in
less
than
six
hours
and
mike
is
gone
i
do
even
know
if
he
dead
or
alive
spiros
glanced
around
at
the
others
wondering
what
to
do
the
frequency
was
being
compromised
but
probably
it
was
worth
the
risk
his
instincts
were
telling
him
she
was
for
real
miss
whoever
you
are
you
must
identify
yourself
he
paused
a
moment
thinking
then
he
asked
where
is
ulysses
i
told
you
he
disappeared
he
screwed
up
and
destroyed
the
gantry
and
then
he
vanished
but
i
think
they
already
loaded
a
bomb
in
the
payload
bay
of
spiros
clicked
off
the
microphone
she
knows
vance
code
name
but
half
the
aegean
probably
knows
that
by
now
he
clicked
the
mike
back
on
i
giving
you
one
more
opportunity
to
identify
yourself
or
this
conversation
will
be
terminated
i
cally
andros
project
director
for
satcom
i
was
with
michael
vance
when
he
talked
to
somebody
in
athens
named
dimitri
yesterday
morning
and
i
was
with
him
a
couple
of
hours
ago
when
he
was
talking
to
you
how
do
you
think
i
knew
this
frequency
what
in
hell
do
i
have
to
do
to
convince
you
people
that
the
assault
ca
wait
they
have
a
countdown
in
progress
i
do
know
what
they
plan
to
do
but
there
a
very
good
chance
a
bomb
is
going
somewhere
i
think
she
legit
spiros
said
clicking
off
the
microphone
again
it
adds
up
sounds
like
mike
was
trying
to
shut
them
down
and
must
have
managed
to
muck
things
up
i
thought
he
was
better
than
that
but
this
is
very
bad
news
by
now
everybody
was
rousing
intent
on
the
radio
conversation
a
storm
was
coming
down
and
now
the
whole
plan
was
about
to
get
revised
again
worse
still
the
insert
would
have
to
be
managed
without
a
point
man
unless
andros
armont
began
please
tell
me
precisely
what
happened
to
michael
vance
i
want
to
know
if
he
is
still
alive
and
if
so
where
he
is
she
told
him
what
she
knew
in
a
way
that
was
repetitive
and
rambling
it
also
was
convincing
do
you
think
they
can
launch
in
this
kind
of
weather
the
storm
will
probably
let
up
by
daybreak
that
how
the
weather
usually
works
here
i
do
think
it
going
to
be
a
problem
all
right
armont
interjected
looks
like
we
better
come
in
i
would
ask
you
where
you
are
now
but
that
might
compromise
your
safety
i
do
have
one
more
request
though
could
you
stay
by
the
radio
and
assist
us
after
insertion
telling
us
as
best
you
know
how
the
hostiles
are
deployed
it
could
be
very
helpful
and
possibly
save
a
lot
of
lives
yes
i
do
anything
you
want
me
to
but
you
ca
wait
until
tomorrow
night
if
you
do
there
may
not
be
any
point
in
coming
at
all
then
stay
up
on
this
frequency
armont
said
and
nodded
to
the
others
you
be
hearing
from
us
it
was
a
gamble
taking
the
word
of
some
anonymous
voice
on
the
radio
but
sometimes
you
had
to
go
with
your
instincts
as
he
looked
around
they
all
agreed
did
you
get
it
radioman
first
class
howard
ansel
asked
the
radio
room
at
gournes
had
been
particularly
hectic
the
last
few
hours
but
he
was
glad
he
had
thought
of
scanning
ansel
was
eight
and
had
eyes
that
reminded
people
of
the
german
shepherds
he
raised
back
home
in
nebraska
it
on
the
tape
big
al
replied
lifting
off
his
headphones
and
scratching
at
his
crew
cut
but
i
do
have
the
goddamnedest
idea
what
it
means
does
matter
it
was
somewhere
off
andikythera
which
means
automatically
classified
top
secret
whatever
the
hell
going
on
it
sounds
like
some
bad
shit
what
was
that
about
a
launch
going
in
is
this
some
kind
of
priority
exercise
who
the
hell
knows
but
we
got
orders
he
picked
up
the
phone
and
punched
in
the
number
for
his
supervising
officer
armont
felt
the
cold
surf
slam
against
his
leg
as
they
slipped
the
two
black
zodiacs
back
into
the
swell
taking
care
to
avoid
the
jagged
rocks
along
the
water
edge
the
surf
was
washing
over
them
and
everything
felt
cold
and
slippery
reginald
hall
was
the
first
to
pull
himself
aboard
after
which
he
looked
back
as
though
trying
to
account
for
everybody
and
everything
the
weather
was
starting
to
clamp
down
now
faster
than
anybody
could
have
expected
pierre
hans
was
already
in
the
second
zodiac
tossing
a
line
across
their
insertion
platforms
both
equipped
with
small
outboard
motors
were
lashed
together
with
a
nylon
line
hurry
up
he
turned
and
used
an
oar
to
hold
the
raft
clear
we
need
to
get
moving
before
this
thing
gets
ripped
to
pieces
neoprene
was
tough
but
there
were
limits
willem
voorst
tossed
the
last
crate
of
equipment
into
the
second
craft
then
grasped
a
line
hugo
had
thrown
and
pulled
himself
aboard
dimitri
spiros
went
next
and
then
armont
the
wind
and
current
were
already
tugging
them
toward
the
south
so
the
outboards
would
have
some
help
in
battling
the
choppy
sea
reggie
hall
was
muttering
to
himself
as
he
tried
to
start
the
engine
he
bloody
well
did
fancy
anything
about
the
way
things
were
going
everything
about
this
op
was
starting
to
give
him
the
willies
when
this
much
went
wrong
this
soon
you
hated
to
think
about
what
things
would
be
like
when
the
going
really
got
tough
as
they
motored
into
the
dark
willem
voorst
kept
an
eye
on
the
eastern
horizon
watching
for
the
first
glimmer
and
prayed
the
storm
would
keep
down
visibility
he
also
monitored
the
compass
and
hoped
they
could
stay
on
course
where
had
the
weather
come
from
the
woman
who
had
said
her
name
was
andros
was
probably
right
though
this
one
would
blow
out
by
dawn
but
in
the
meantime
it
was
a
hell
of
a
ruckus
and
the
reception
coming
up
on
the
island
was
going
to
be
brandy
and
a
dry
bed
either
you
know
reggie
was
yelling
this
bloody
weather
might
even
be
a
help
with
the
insertion
if
it
keeps
up
it
could
be
the
perfect
cover
what
we
really
have
to
hope
armont
shouted
back
is
that
a
storm
like
this
might
force
them
to
delay
the
launch
she
said
it
would
but
who
knows
still
we
ca
count
on
it
by
the
way
how
we
doing
i
think
we
already
made
a
kilometer
or
maybe
a
klick
and
a
half
hans
yelled
if
we
can
keep
making
this
kind
of
headway
we
should
make
landfall
just
before
hours
in
time
to
join
everybody
for
morning
coffee
he
looked
around
this
has
got
to
be
the
stupidest
thing
we
ever
tried
to
do
we
just
motoring
into
a
shitstorm
he
shook
his
head
and
the
raindrops
in
his
hair
sprayed
into
the
dark
i
ca
fucking
believe
we
doing
it
i
really
fucking
believe
it
damn
major
general
nichols
said
covering
the
mouthpiece
of
the
phone
he
was
on
the
kennedy
in
mission
planning
talking
on
secured
satellite
phone
to
jsoc
control
in
the
pentagon
gournes
picked
up
some
radio
traffic
on
sideband
some
assholes
are
talking
about
trying
to
go
in
whoever
the
hell
they
working
for
they
could
screw
things
up
royally
he
spoke
again
into
the
receiver
do
you
have
a
lead
on
where
they
are
he
nodded
right
my
thinking
exactly
which
means
they
probably
blew
up
that
plane
as
a
diversion
and
our
jockey
suckered
for
it
he
paused
again
no
we
not
scheduled
to
go
in
for
another
hours
but
that
may
have
to
be
pushed
up
say
we
have
two
choices
either
we
interdict
these
dingbats
or
we
just
go
ahead
and
get
it
over
with
take
out
the
launch
vehicle
and
he
paused
again
what
do
you
mean
we
ca
his
eyes
narrowed
do
give
me
that
bullshit
i
got
top
secret
clearance
and
i
damned
well
have
a
to
know
a
long
pause
ensued
jesus
now
you
tell
me
material
what
the
hell
does
that
mean
you
planning
to
send
in
my
boys
to
take
down
a
nuke
this
is
the
first
i
heard
thanks
a
lot
for
telling
me
good
christ
he
paused
once
more
okay
let
me
think
i
get
back
to
you
he
settled
the
phone
back
in
its
cradle
and
looked
around
mission
planning
the
gray
walls
covered
with
maps
shit
this
whole
thing
is
coming
apart
what
is
it
general
max
austin
asked
he
was
with
gray
hair
as
the
base
commander
for
souda
he
had
been
placed
in
charge
of
operation
lightfoot
code
name
for
the
action
to
retake
andikythera
even
though
they
had
known
each
other
for
fifteen
years
nichols
was
not
necessarily
pleased
to
have
this
remf
motherfucker
running
the
show
austin
had
been
given
the
undemanding
post
on
crete
for
a
year
mainly
as
an
excuse
to
bump
up
his
rank
in
preparation
for
retirement
the
whole
op
is
rapidly
going
to
hell
in
a
handbag
nichols
said
the
pentagon
conveniently
left
one
small
fact
out
of
my
briefing
papers
i
kill
somebody
if
only
i
knew
who
he
looked
up
max
we
may
have
to
send
the
deltas
in
tonight
just
get
this
damned
thing
over
with
that
not
possible
austin
declared
without
hesitation
this
operation
ca
go
off
you
of
all
people
ought
to
know
that
well
sometimes
circumstances
do
wait
around
for
the
textbooks
the
gournes
sigint
team
just
intercepted
some
radio
traffic
somebody
out
there
talking
and
they
know
more
than
we
do
they
probably
lance
clowns
most
likely
mercenaries
but
they
claiming
the
bad
guys
may
be
about
to
launch
one
of
the
vehicles
within
the
next
few
hours
so
they
planning
to
hit
the
place
tonight
well
they
wo
stand
a
chance
austin
said
i
agree
but
what
they
can
do
is
royally
fuck
up
our
insertion
they
disrupt
the
hell
out
of
everything
and
probably
get
a
lot
of
the
hostages
killed
okay
austin
mused
sipping
at
his
coffee
we
got
two
problems
here
maybe
they
should
be
handled
separately
first
we
interdict
these
guys
going
in
and
then
we
decide
what
to
do
next
best
way
to
solve
them
both
at
once
two
birds
with
one
stone
is
with
a
preemptory
strike
on
the
island
nichols
insisted
again
right
now
tonight
we
just
go
in
and
take
the
place
down
no
way
eric
austin
interjected
going
to
skew
the
risk
parameters
in
our
ops
analysis
we
have
to
scrap
our
computer
simulation
and
virtually
start
over
hell
that
alone
could
take
us
three
hours
all
those
fancy
analyses
are
best
employed
wiping
your
bum
nichols
heard
himself
thinking
almost
but
not
quite
out
loud
we
got
nobody
on
the
ground
so
we
working
with
satellite
intel
and
sigint
which
ai
giving
us
shit
those
bastards
are
talking
on
their
radios
let
me
make
sure
i
heard
it
right
a
minute
ago
nichols
went
on
we
ca
just
take
out
the
launch
vehicles
a
surgical
strike
because
there
a
chance
there
could
be
nuclear
material
on
board
you
got
it
right
i
hoped
not
to
have
to
tell
you
so
consider
this
classified
the
whole
op
has
been
jacked
up
to
a
vega
one
never
had
anything
that
serious
before
that
nuclear
nichols
told
himself
well
he
figured
why
not
if
the
terrorists
did
have
a
bomb
this
damned
thing
is
hot
austin
continued
they
do
get
any
hotter
so
there
no
way
in
hell
i
going
to
go
around
procedures
if
you
and
your
boys
do
do
this
clean
it
going
to
mean
our
next
command
yours
and
mine
will
be
somewhere
within
sight
of
tierra
del
fuego
if
there
a
nuclear
incident
here
the
greek
government
would
probably
tear
up
our
treaty
and
convert
the
base
at
souda
into
a
souvlaki
stand
am
i
making
myself
clear
if
i
hear
you
right
what
you
saying
is
no
way
can
we
afford
to
fuck
this
one
up
i
always
admired
your
quick
grasp
of
the
salient
points
in
a
briefing
so
we
going
to
do
this
by
the
goddamn
book
we
going
to
dot
every
goddamn
and
cross
every
goddamn
and
get
every
goddamn
detail
of
this
op
right
down
to
the
color
of
our
goddamn
shoelaces
approved
signed
off
and
in
triplicate
that
iranian
hostage
disaster
did
not
exactly
make
a
lot
of
careers
again
i
ask
you
eric
am
i
getting
the
fuck
through
in
skywriting
the
only
small
problem
i
see
sir
is
that
while
everybody
is
carefully
protecting
their
pension
those
assholes
on
the
island
may
start
slaughtering
hostages
or
put
this
material
which
i
have
just
learned
about
in
such
a
timely
fashion
into
goddamn
orbit
and
then
my
deltas
are
going
to
be
in
the
middle
of
a
shitstorm
they
easily
could
have
prevented
if
they
been
given
the
chance
they
my
boys
and
i
do
really
take
kindly
to
that
happening
he
reached
in
his
breast
pocket
for
a
cigar
the
chewing
of
which
was
his
usual
response
to
stress
so
what
exactly
do
you
propose
we
do
austin
asked
the
most
obvious
first
thing
would
be
to
interdict
this
bunch
of
mercenary
jerkoffs
and
keep
them
from
going
in
there
and
getting
a
lot
of
people
killed
i
say
we
should
find
them
and
stop
them
using
whatever
force
it
takes
there
are
enough
civilians
in
harm
way
as
it
is
he
leaned
forward
look
if
we
have
to
dick
around
waiting
on
the
pentagon
before
we
can
go
in
at
least
we
can
stop
these
mercenary
assholes
it
has
to
be
done
and
we
do
need
some
computer
study
before
we
get
off
our
ass
i
want
to
take
them
down
and
nobody
has
to
even
know
about
it
if
it
comes
out
in
some
debriefing
someday
worry
about
it
then
all
right
maybe
i
agree
with
you
austin
sighed
they
should
be
interdicted
what
do
you
want
a
just
give
me
an
to
pick
them
up
i
going
to
put
the
love
of
the
lord
into
these
amateurs
then
bring
them
in
hell
probably
just
doing
what
somebody
paid
them
to
do
and
who
could
blame
that
somebody
he
found
himself
thinking
if
it
takes
the
of
this
long
to
cut
through
its
damned
bureaucracy
and
mount
an
operation
all
right
i
give
you
a
seahawk
austin
said
it
can
be
prepped
and
ready
to
go
by
he
glanced
at
his
watch
hours
will
that
be
enough
guess
it
have
to
be
by
that
time
he
was
thinking
ruefully
we
could
be
taking
the
island
and
with
that
thought
he
decided
to
hell
with
protocol
and
fired
up
his
cigar
look
eric
i
know
what
you
thinking
austin
said
after
a
pause
that
an
old
fart
like
me
is
cramping
your
guys
style
and
dammit
maybe
there
a
grain
of
truth
in
that
hell
more
than
a
grain
but
here
the
downside
if
your
deltas
go
in
and
get
cut
up
we
going
to
get
blamed
on
the
other
hand
if
they
do
go
in
till
washington
says
so
then
yes
maybe
it
be
too
late
but
it
going
to
be
on
somebody
else
service
record
not
ours
i
protecting
your
boys
whether
you
see
it
or
not
if
we
only
go
in
on
orders
then
the
deltas
are
not
going
to
be
the
ones
taking
the
heat
if
this
thing
falls
apart
just
get
me
the
damned
chopper
nichols
said
quietly
mannheim
looked
at
her
cally
we
need
to
try
and
find
him
this
vance
fellow
if
his
friends
are
going
to
try
and
come
in
then
they
need
him
to
help
them
he
know
what
they
require
a
lot
better
than
you
will
she
found
herself
nodding
grimly
agreeing
isaac
mannheim
was
no
dummy
they
must
either
have
captured
him
or
shot
him
she
said
or
both
he
would
have
come
back
by
now
unless
there
was
a
problem
but
if
still
alive
then
they
probably
have
him
down
at
launch
and
it
going
to
be
very
dangerous
for
us
to
go
down
there
isaac
i
an
old
man
maybe
i
outlived
my
usefulness
it
was
strange
talk
for
isaac
mannheim
but
he
was
turning
wistful
perhaps
even
defeated
i
do
know
one
thing
he
risked
his
life
for
me
i
owe
it
to
him
to
at
least
find
out
what
happened
so
let
me
go
by
myself
she
did
not
like
the
sound
of
that
look
maybe
i
no
not
you
they
got
to
be
looking
for
you
but
they
probably
just
think
i
an
old
fool
he
laughed
and
maybe
they
right
at
any
rate
at
least
i
can
go
down
there
and
wander
around
a
bit
everybody
knows
i
harmless
as
long
as
it
does
look
like
i
going
anywhere
i
do
think
they
bother
with
me
at
least
not
right
now
if
they
busy
with
the
countdown
they
not
going
to
trouble
with
a
deranged
old
man
i
small
potatoes
isaac
you
a
very
big
potato
she
wanted
to
hug
him
but
also
just
about
the
most
wonderful
man
i
know
i
love
you
to
death
just
be
careful
please
now
it
was
his
turn
to
smile
the
old
face
showing
its
wrinkles
more
than
ever
i
not
dead
yet
and
with
any
luck
i
wo
be
for
a
while
he
looked
at
his
watch
by
the
way
when
do
you
think
those
friends
of
his
are
likely
to
show
up
did
say
but
i
expect
they
might
get
here
in
a
couple
of
hours
well
andros
we
not
licked
yet
with
any
luck
there
wo
even
be
a
launch
maybe
the
weather
in
the
meantime
why
do
i
check
the
empty
storage
bays
in
launch
just
a
hunch
he
rose
and
kissed
her
then
began
to
shuffle
down
the
hill
i
guess
he
at
about
a
thousand
meters
now
pierre
was
saying
above
them
the
seahawk
was
sweeping
past
clearly
on
a
recon
maybe
he
wo
pick
us
up
not
with
the
swell
this
high
armont
did
really
believe
his
own
words
the
seahawk
helo
the
navy
preeminent
asw
platform
had
come
in
hard
from
the
south
and
it
was
searching
the
question
was
what
for
whatever
it
was
the
guy
was
all
business
and
given
his
radar
not
to
mention
his
ir
capabilities
eluding
detection
was
going
to
be
tough
must
have
figured
out
we
scammed
them
reggie
declared
i
was
afraid
it
was
going
to
catch
up
with
us
what
with
the
electronic
assets
the
has
got
deployed
in
this
region
you
almost
have
to
expect
it
probably
the
fucking
radio
which
means
we
got
to
keep
silence
from
here
on
in
damn
armont
squinted
through
the
dark
let
wait
and
see
what
happens
as
far
as
i
know
those
things
do
carry
any
cannon
just
a
couple
of
asw
torpedoes
we
a
pretty
small
fish
let
hold
firm
for
now
they
hunkered
down
and
motored
on
watching
as
the
navy
chopper
growled
on
toward
the
north
maybe
everybody
was
thinking
the
crew
had
missed
them
maybe
they
were
after
somebody
else
maybe
no
it
was
coming
back
again
sweeping
on
a
determined
mission
to
locate
something
they
going
to
pick
us
up
sooner
or
later
willem
voorst
predicted
it
just
a
matter
of
time
the
wind
and
sea
were
growing
ever
more
unruly
but
that
was
not
going
to
save
them
they
all
knew
it
i
got
a
terrible
idea
reggie
said
almost
yelling
to
be
heard
it
going
to
mean
we
go
in
with
a
complement
of
equipment
but
i
beginning
to
think
we
do
have
any
choice
what
are
you
suggesting
armont
asked
his
voice
almost
swept
away
by
the
storm
we
cut
loose
one
of
the
rafts
leave
a
radio
transmitting
a
mayday
by
the
time
they
realize
they
been
had
we
be
at
the
island
what
about
their
ir
assets
armont
wondered
back
okay
good
point
so
we
set
a
flare
and
maybe
attach
a
couple
of
life
jackets
with
a
saltwater
beacon
that
engage
their
ir
and
what
do
we
do
this
motor
will
still
have
an
ir
signature
hall
thought
a
moment
we
could
cover
everything
with
some
of
the
plastic
camouflage
that
should
cut
down
the
heat
signature
enough
reggie
i
do
think
that
such
a
hot
idea
spiros
yelled
the
rain
in
his
face
we
not
going
to
be
able
to
shake
them
that
easily
do
be
so
sure
there
a
good
chance
a
decoy
would
keep
them
off
our
scent
for
a
while
might
just
give
us
enough
time
mates
the
seahawk
had
swept
past
again
banked
and
now
was
coming
back
clearly
working
a
grid
maybe
getting
her
electronics
up
to
speed
nothing
about
it
boded
particularly
well
for
some
reason
it
was
lit
a
long
white
streak
in
the
dark
long
and
lean
and
ideal
to
drop
asw
drogues
the
sikorsky
incorporated
pounds
of
avionics
and
was
even
designed
to
carry
nuclear
depth
bombs
though
the
choppers
were
never
wired
for
the
weapon
its
maximum
cruising
speed
was
mph
with
a
loitering
capability
given
time
it
would
find
them
willem
how
much
farther
do
you
reckon
we
got
to
go
to
make
the
island
armont
shouted
over
the
growing
gale
and
the
roar
of
the
two
outboards
my
guess
is
we
looking
at
another
eight
or
ten
kilometers
but
i
vote
with
reggie
we
got
no
choice
but
to
try
a
decoy
setup
keep
this
raft
the
engine
is
running
better
and
start
moving
over
whatever
gear
we
absolutely
have
to
have
he
knew
there
might
well
be
some
dispute
over
that
with
each
man
having
a
pet
piece
of
equipment
he
deemed
himself
unable
to
live
without
but
the
men
of
arm
were
pragmatists
above
all
and
they
would
bend
over
backward
to
reach
a
consensus
they
began
sorting
the
gear
hastily
and
the
selections
being
made
cut
down
their
assault
options
balaclavas
would
be
kept
along
with
rappelling
harnesses
and
rope
the
heavier
ordnance
had
to
be
left
the
grenade
launchers
and
shotguns
they
quickly
pulled
over
a
case
of
grenades
but
the
others
they
left
radios
of
course
had
to
be
saved
and
the
heckler
koch
and
the
no
uzis
those
were
for
cowboys
each
man
had
his
own
handgun
of
choice
but
the
rounds
of
ammo
were
cut
down
to
a
bare
minimum
as
they
sorted
the
gear
they
were
making
an
unspoken
strategic
decision
concerning
how
the
insertion
would
be
structured
without
the
heavy
firepower
they
would
be
fighting
a
guerrilla
war
focusing
on
taking
out
ramirez
and
hoping
the
firefight
would
be
over
in
seconds
if
it
lasted
more
than
fifteen
minutes
they
were
finished
the
result
might
well
be
an
assault
more
risky
than
it
otherwise
would
have
been
but
as
reggie
was
fond
of
saying
you
ca
have
everything
sometimes
you
ca
even
come
bloody
close
seahawk
one
this
is
bravo
command
come
up
with
anything
yet
it
was
the
radio
beside
delta
captain
philip
sexton
who
was
flying
copilot
in
the
seahawk
lieutenant
manny
jackson
was
pilot
while
the
airborne
tactical
officer
was
lieutenant
james
palmer
ii
and
the
sensor
operator
was
lieutenant
andrew
mcleod
any
hint
of
unintelligent
life
down
there
andy
says
the
damned
radar
picking
up
too
much
chop
yankee
bravo
do
think
we
going
to
find
these
bastards
it
the
proverbial
needle
in
the
this
baby
finds
subs
not
dinghies
looks
like
all
we
getting
so
far
is
fish
scatter
just
noise
then
you
might
want
to
see
if
the
ir
will
give
you
anything
came
nichols
voice
the
fuckers
have
clamped
down
total
radio
silence
but
they
got
to
be
there
somewhere
roger
we
copy
do
know
if
we
got
the
sensitivity
to
pick
up
a
thermal
though
not
with
this
weather
and
sea
copy
that
so
try
everything
you
got
even
sonar
or
the
mag
anomaly
detector
hell
try
all
your
toys
these
bastards
are
close
to
slipping
through
and
no
way
can
that
be
allowed
to
happen
you
got
a
rog
sir
sexton
replied
i
have
andy
give
the
ir
a
shot
and
see
what
we
get
they
staying
right
on
us
hugo
voorst
observed
looking
up
they
do
have
us
yet
but
they
probably
figured
out
we
make
a
beeline
for
andikythera
so
all
they
have
to
do
is
just
work
the
corridor
for
all
it
worth
then
let
get
on
with
it
armont
nodded
through
the
rain
do
we
have
everything
you
think
we
might
need
we
got
everything
we
can
bloody
well
keep
afloat
reggie
yelled
back
we
leaving
half
of
what
we
need
he
knew
that
seven
men
in
the
single
zodiac
together
with
their
gear
was
going
to
be
pushing
it
to
the
limit
the
sea
was
still
rising
which
meant
they
would
be
bailing
for
their
lives
as
soon
as
they
cut
loose
all
right
then
willem
set
the
timer
on
the
flares
armont
shook
his
head
sadly
if
we
keep
having
to
abandon
equipment
hall
could
be
heard
grumbling
this
is
going
to
be
a
damned
expensive
operation
where
in
bloody
hell
is
it
going
to
end
when
we
down
to
a
bow
and
arrow
each
it
beginning
to
feel
that
way
now
willem
voorst
groused
he
had
finished
and
was
clambering
into
the
single
raft
with
his
weight
aboard
it
listed
precariously
taking
water
as
the
waves
washed
over
he
settled
in
grabbed
a
plastic
bucket
and
started
bailing
now
the
seahawk
was
coming
down
the
line
again
making
an
even
slower
pass
time
had
run
out
all
right
cut
her
loose
armont
ordered
the
radio
they
left
had
been
set
to
broadcast
a
mayday
the
engine
was
locked
at
full
throttle
and
a
couple
of
life
jackets
with
activated
beacons
had
been
tied
to
a
line
and
tossed
overboard
the
flares
had
been
set
to
a
timer
giving
them
three
minutes
to
put
some
blue
water
between
them
and
the
decoy
with
a
sigh
dimitri
spiros
leaned
out
and
severed
the
last
connecting
line
i
just
picked
up
a
mayday
jackson
yelled
from
somewhere
in
this
quadrant
i
think
we
located
our
bogey
and
he
in
trouble
he
banked
the
seahawk
trying
to
get
a
fix
not
surprising
with
these
seas
he
gave
the
instruments
a
quick
check
they
ca
be
far
away
andy
anything
happening
on
ir
nothing
to
write
home
about
there
jesus
it
looks
like
he
glanced
out
the
cockpit
window
the
hell
with
the
ir
we
got
a
visual
on
this
baby
he
right
down
there
he
pointed
see
it
take
her
in
and
see
what
we
can
see
you
got
it
jackson
hit
the
collective
and
banked
heading
down
yep
he
thought
no
doubt
about
it
there
was
an
emergency
flare
maybe
the
fuckers
had
capsized
maybe
there
was
a
god
i
think
they
went
for
it
armont
declared
his
voice
almost
lost
in
the
storm
it
going
to
take
them
a
while
to
figure
out
the
raft
is
empty
and
then
some
more
time
to
make
sure
there
nobody
in
those
life
jackets
i
think
we
milked
maybe
half
an
hour
out
of
this
then
we
home
free
dimitri
said
staring
toward
the
dark
horizon
we
should
make
landfall
just
before
first
light
one
thing
though
reginald
hall
reflected
we
ca
risk
any
more
radio
contact
we
clearly
being
monitored
so
whatever
happened
to
michael
he
on
his
own
armont
said
nothing
in
reply
merely
scanned
the
turbulent
skies
maybe
he
thought
the
weather
had
worked
to
their
advantage
had
saved
them
from
interdiction
by
the
navy
but
would
it
be
enough
to
delay
the
launch
he
was
beginning
to
think
the
storm
might
clear
in
time
given
the
way
aegean
downpours
tended
to
come
and
go
and
not
even
put
a
dent
in
the
schedule
ramirez
walked
into
command
wondering
peretz
was
at
the
main
workstation
the
one
normally
controlled
by
georges
lefarge
and
he
was
wearing
a
big
grin
the
stupid
one
he
sported
so
often
so
what
was
the
problem
he
had
sent
a
computer
message
to
launch
saying
they
needed
to
talk
what
was
this
about
he
suspected
he
already
knew
the
room
was
busy
resounding
with
the
clatter
of
key
boards
the
whir
of
tape
drives
the
buzz
of
fans
the
hum
of
communication
lines
the
snapping
of
switches
above
them
a
digital
clock
showed
the
countdown
clicking
off
the
hours
minutes
and
seconds
while
next
to
it
were
the
three
master
video
screens
the
first
giving
the
numerical
status
of
the
cyclops
sequence
the
second
depicting
the
fujitsu
latest
orbital
projection
being
lines
across
a
flat
projection
of
the
globe
and
the
third
showing
a
live
feed
from
the
base
of
where
the
antlike
images
of
satcom
launch
control
staffers
could
be
seen
methodically
readying
the
vehicle
not
having
any
idea
what
was
about
to
go
up
got
a
little
item
to
go
over
with
you
peretz
said
in
arabic
not
looking
up
from
his
screen
a
minor
business
matter
what
on
your
mind
ramirez
asked
in
english
we
all
busy
peretz
glanced
in
the
direction
of
salim
who
was
standing
by
the
door
keeping
a
watchful
eye
on
the
staffers
salim
he
knew
spoke
farsi
as
a
first
language
and
english
as
a
second
like
many
iranians
he
had
not
deigned
to
learn
arabic
peretz
on
the
other
hand
spoke
it
fluently
furthermore
he
had
brushed
up
on
it
in
his
recent
experiences
with
the
palestinians
ramirez
of
course
had
spoken
it
for
almost
twenty
years
finding
it
indispensable
for
his
business
dealings
in
the
islamic
world
the
time
is
overdue
for
us
to
have
a
business
chat
peretz
continued
in
arabic
revolving
around
in
his
chair
i
been
thinking
over
the
money
it
strikes
me
that
the
split
ought
to
be
each
according
to
his
ability
if
you
know
what
i
mean
you
a
marxist
right
if
you
insist
ramirez
replied
immediately
realizing
he
had
been
right
about
the
direction
the
conversation
was
going
to
take
he
also
understood
the
reason
for
the
arabic
you
may
have
the
quotation
in
reverse
but
i
assume
you
did
not
call
me
down
here
to
discuss
the
finer
points
of
collectivist
ideology
nobody
ever
called
you
dumb
friend
peretz
went
on
now
settling
comfortably
into
the
mellifluous
music
of
the
arabic
he
actually
liked
the
language
better
than
hebrew
understood
why
it
was
the
perfect
vehicle
for
poetry
so
i
expect
you
wo
have
any
trouble
understanding
this
he
was
handing
ramirez
a
plain
white
business
envelope
unsealed
sabri
ramirez
suppressed
an
impulse
to
pull
out
his
beretta
and
just
shoot
the
fucker
between
the
eyes
the
only
thing
that
surprised
him
was
why
this
extortion
for
that
surely
was
what
it
was
had
been
so
long
in
coming
peretz
had
been
planning
this
move
all
along
after
a
moment
pause
he
took
the
envelope
and
held
it
in
his
hand
not
bothering
even
to
look
down
at
it
instead
he
let
his
gaze
wander
around
the
room
taking
in
the
rows
of
video
terminals
some
with
data
some
with
shots
of
the
working
areas
together
with
the
lines
of
shocked
staffers
then
his
gaze
came
back
to
peretz
a
novice
at
the
trade
this
inevitable
development
in
fact
almost
saddened
him
he
had
over
the
past
couple
of
months
acquired
almost
a
fondness
for
the
israeli
he
even
had
come
to
tolerate
his
irreverent
humor
if
that
what
it
could
be
called
thus
he
had
begun
to
wonder
in
a
calculated
way
if
they
might
have
a
partnership
that
could
continue
beyond
the
current
episode
a
good
tech
man
was
hard
to
find
do
i
need
to
bother
opening
this
he
said
finally
why
do
i
just
guess
at
this
point
you
feel
your
services
have
become
indispensable
so
you
want
to
restructure
the
distribution
of
the
money
you
want
to
cut
out
the
others
and
i
suppose
there
even
a
chance
you
want
to
cut
me
out
as
well
cut
you
out
peretz
grinned
again
never
crossed
my
mind
the
way
i
see
it
we
business
partners
baby
colleagues
i
never
ever
try
and
screw
a
partner
surely
you
know
that
what
do
you
take
me
for
no
man
i
just
think
there
no
point
in
giving
monetary
encouragement
to
all
these
other
assholes
and
what
if
i
do
choose
to
see
it
your
way
ramirez
kept
his
voice
calm
well
there
could
be
a
lot
of
problems
with
the
countdown
if
you
know
what
i
mean
there
only
one
guy
around
here
who
could
fix
it
so
i
think
teamwork
is
essential
you
do
your
part
and
i
do
mine
the
old
mile
your
mile
i
take
it
is
to
finish
the
job
you
were
hired
for
in
the
first
place
ramirez
found
keeping
his
voice
even
to
be
more
and
more
difficult
but
he
had
to
bide
his
time
a
quick
glance
at
salim
told
him
that
the
iranian
did
not
have
an
inkling
of
what
was
going
on
you
might
say
that
again
the
inane
grin
and
mine
is
to
restructure
the
dispersals
of
the
money
afterwards
ramirez
eyes
had
just
gone
opaque
behind
his
gray
shades
something
like
that
not
now
it
all
in
the
envelope
you
what
ramirez
said
finally
his
anger
about
to
boil
over
i
going
back
to
launch
and
i
take
this
with
me
what
the
point
in
opening
it
here
raising
questions
you
better
take
this
problem
seriously
believe
me
peretz
interjected
vaguely
unnerved
by
ramirez
icy
noncommittal
i
not
kidding
around
oh
i
take
you
quite
seriously
dr
peretz
he
was
extracting
a
thin
cigar
from
a
gold
case
i
always
have
you
will
definitely
get
everything
you
deserve
i
intend
to
isaac
mannheim
stumbled
through
the
torrential
rain
wondering
if
the
terrorists
were
stupid
enough
to
try
a
launch
in
this
kind
of
weather
actually
he
found
himself
thinking
it
might
just
be
possible
the
guidance
system
would
be
tested
to
the
limit
but
if
the
weather
eased
up
a
little
the
aboveground
structures
for
launch
were
just
ahead
including
the
two
pads
with
the
vehicles
sprouting
into
the
sky
from
the
looks
of
things
they
were
both
unharmed
with
clearly
prepped
and
ready
for
launch
then
he
paused
to
examine
the
collapsed
gantry
and
shook
his
head
in
dismay
heartsick
at
the
sight
that
was
going
to
cost
a
fortune
to
repair
he
shrugged
sadly
and
moved
on
he
knew
it
was
going
to
be
a
beehive
of
activity
inside
the
tech
areas
now
the
entire
satcom
staff
was
on
duty
which
was
standard
for
a
go
situation
which
meant
that
they
had
to
be
holding
vance
somewhere
out
of
the
way
the
question
was
where
where
he
tried
to
think
there
were
some
bays
locations
where
items
that
constantly
needed
replacing
could
be
held
ready
to
hand
but
everything
was
clicking
now
with
those
areas
pretty
much
out
of
the
loop
so
maybe
that
would
be
the
place
to
start
checking
the
main
for
the
bays
were
naturally
enough
from
the
inside
but
there
also
was
a
large
loading
dock
on
the
south
that
allowed
gear
to
be
delivered
directly
from
the
warehouse
maybe
that
would
be
the
logical
place
to
try
and
slip
in
he
was
feeling
better
now
energized
why
not
go
in
have
a
look
moreau
punched
him
again
then
waited
for
a
response
there
was
one
but
only
because
michael
vance
was
near
to
passing
out
they
had
taken
him
not
to
the
bates
motel
but
to
an
unused
room
at
the
periphery
of
launch
its
original
purpose
was
clear
but
whatever
it
was
it
no
longer
appeared
to
be
used
for
anything
the
ideal
location
to
beat
somebody
brains
half
out
you
have
a
remarkably
low
tolerance
for
this
you
sleazy
vance
merely
moaned
he
had
been
trying
mystical
techniques
for
blocking
out
the
pain
god
he
hated
pain
so
he
attempted
to
focus
his
mind
on
something
else
on
little
things
like
working
on
his
boat
on
making
love
on
caribbean
sunsets
instead
what
he
got
was
the
vision
of
a
nuclear
bomb
going
off
somewhere
and
the
anger
he
had
felt
when
ramirez
and
his
thugs
blew
up
the
frigate
still
any
emotion
any
feeling
he
could
muster
seemed
to
drive
back
the
pain
make
it
more
endurable
now
he
was
focusing
as
best
he
could
on
the
blond
french
goon
who
was
pummeling
him
whack
love
whack
hate
whack
anger
boiling
seething
anger
it
was
almost
working
almost
he
moaned
again
then
for
one
last
time
he
tried
to
smile
jesus
what
sewer
did
ramirez
dredge
to
come
up
with
you
guys
good
good
keep
talking
moreau
said
sounds
mean
you
are
still
alive
it
means
you
still
can
feel
and
he
hit
him
again
hard
in
the
stomach
taking
his
breath
away
once
more
the
moans
had
become
airless
grunts
moreau
had
readily
accepted
the
job
of
softening
up
the
fucker
who
had
caused
them
so
much
trouble
it
was
intended
to
be
a
partial
compensation
for
his
having
endured
the
radar
treatment
and
also
it
felt
good
to
be
able
to
work
over
the
very
son
of
a
bitch
who
had
done
it
there
was
indeed
justice
in
the
world
justice
that
you
made
for
yourself
he
was
now
making
his
own
justice
and
it
felt
terrific
vance
knew
he
could
take
much
more
of
a
pounding
without
passing
out
moreau
was
a
professional
who
did
specialize
in
breaking
bones
instead
he
confined
himself
to
internal
trauma
that
seemed
to
be
his
particular
area
of
expertise
he
also
was
careful
to
make
sure
his
victim
remained
conscious
which
meant
vance
knew
that
this
part
of
the
program
was
drawing
to
a
close
he
could
handle
much
more
pain
the
fact
of
which
he
knew
this
french
thug
with
the
streaming
blond
hair
was
well
aware
what
he
wondered
was
the
point
anyway
sadism
ramirez
was
still
waiting
in
line
to
dish
out
his
own
particular
brand
of
revenge
and
ramirez
had
forgotten
more
about
dispensing
pain
than
this
creep
would
ever
know
thunk
another
blow
to
the
stomach
took
his
breath
away
once
more
he
felt
his
consciousness
swim
back
and
forth
scarcely
there
any
more
when
was
this
going
to
end
he
would
have
signed
away
anything
just
to
stop
the
punishment
for
a
few
seconds
and
he
was
on
the
verge
of
throwing
up
surely
it
had
to
be
over
soon
he
felt
like
a
boxer
who
had
just
gone
fifteen
rounds
with
no
referee
time
for
the
bell
his
battered
mind
tried
to
put
together
a
guess
about
what
was
next
maybe
after
this
eurotrash
had
had
his
fun
ramirez
would
show
up
for
the
coup
de
grace
it
would
almost
be
welcome
or
maybe
nothing
was
going
to
happen
maybe
ramirez
would
just
leave
him
to
be
blown
up
with
the
rest
of
the
facility
where
was
pierre
if
arm
was
coming
in
for
another
whole
day
who
knew
where
this
disaster
was
headed
what
was
cally
doing
and
bill
were
they
safe
he
cursed
himself
again
for
screwing
up
the
golden
opportunity
to
deactivate
the
gantry
and
bring
the
proceedings
to
a
halt
instead
of
doing
what
he
had
planned
he
tried
to
take
a
shortcut
now
he
realized
that
had
been
a
major
mistake
and
now
with
arm
not
coming
in
for
another
whole
day
the
only
chance
left
was
to
try
and
stall
the
wind
was
howling
and
rain
spattered
on
the
loading
dock
it
should
have
been
protected
but
you
ca
do
everything
as
mannheim
briskly
made
his
way
up
the
metal
steps
the
large
sliding
door
was
locked
but
he
still
had
the
magnetized
card
that
clicked
it
open
a
button
on
the
wall
started
it
moving
along
the
rollers
just
enough
to
slide
through
there
he
was
in
inside
was
a
long
hallway
cluttered
with
various
crates
either
just
delivered
or
ready
to
be
removed
he
was
not
sure
and
he
had
to
feel
his
way
along
not
wanting
to
risk
turning
on
the
lights
for
an
instant
as
he
stumbled
among
the
sharp
corners
he
really
felt
his
age
this
was
not
something
for
a
retired
engineering
professor
to
be
muddling
with
he
should
be
back
in
cambridge
growing
orchids
in
his
greenhouse
what
in
blazes
was
he
doing
then
he
noticed
the
light
emerging
from
under
one
of
the
doors
and
as
he
stepped
closer
he
heard
two
voices
one
of
them
belonged
to
the
man
who
had
saved
him
michael
vance
the
other
the
other
had
to
be
one
of
the
terrorists
now
what
you
know
i
hate
to
spoil
all
the
fun
you
having
vance
tried
to
look
at
moreau
but
he
could
barely
see
through
the
swelling
of
his
puffy
eyelids
but
i
got
some
unsettling
news
you
and
the
rest
of
ramirez
hoods
are
about
to
be
in
a
deep
situation
here
the
minute
you
try
to
send
that
bomb
up
you
can
tip
your
hat
and
kiss
your
ass
better
enjoy
this
while
you
can
what
do
you
mean
that
nuke
you
got
primed
it
pains
me
to
tell
you
pardon
the
joke
but
your
gang
is
exactly
the
crew
of
rocket
scientists
you
think
you
are
the
second
the
cyclops
laser
hits
the
first
vehicle
there
going
to
be
a
all
right
only
it
likely
to
be
this
island
headed
for
orbit
and
you
with
it
why
in
hell
do
you
think
i
was
trying
to
stop
it
was
it
true
he
wondered
think
try
to
make
it
sound
convincing
what
are
you
talking
about
moreau
blue
eyes
bristled
just
thought
you
ought
to
know
the
bottom
line
if
you
planning
to
liberate
the
oppressed
masses
or
whatever
this
is
a
hell
of
a
way
to
start
by
nuking
yourself
that
should
really
impress
everybody
with
your
dedication
you
are
going
to
die
anyway
so
what
do
you
care
got
a
point
there
guess
i
just
wasting
my
time
but
there
are
a
few
people
here
on
the
island
that
i
like
you
incidentally
are
not
among
them
and
i
would
kind
of
hate
to
see
them
get
blown
away
because
of
your
fucking
incompetence
he
paused
trying
to
breathe
as
it
happens
i
had
a
chat
with
the
project
director
she
told
me
how
that
system
works
the
nuts
and
bolts
are
a
little
complicated
but
it
boils
down
to
what
happens
inside
the
rocket
when
the
cyclops
laser
starts
up
surely
you
know
the
energy
in
the
cyclops
creates
plasma
in
the
vehicle
that
loose
atoms
which
becomes
the
propellant
vance
looked
at
him
you
do
know
that
do
you
moreau
nodded
almost
but
not
quite
understanding
what
he
was
talking
about
good
because
the
interesting
part
comes
next
you
do
create
this
atomic
soup
called
plasma
without
generating
a
lot
of
electromagnetic
noise
in
other
words
radio
garbage
you
know
he
thought
to
himself
it
getting
to
sound
better
and
better
all
the
time
these
technical
things
do
not
concern
me
moreau
declared
with
a
shrug
they
may
not
concern
you
pal
but
they
might
concern
the
bomb
what
if
one
of
the
radio
signals
produced
just
happens
to
be
the
one
that
triggers
its
detonator
and
believe
me
with
the
smorgasbord
of
radio
noise
that
plasma
produces
the
chances
are
easily
i
hope
you
feel
lucky
asshole
i
do
believe
you
he
sat
down
in
a
spare
chair
beginning
to
appear
a
little
uncertain
you
hotshots
are
a
little
over
your
head
here
maybe
you
ought
to
pass
that
information
to
the
chief
anything
to
get
him
out
of
here
vance
was
thinking
anything
to
give
me
a
little
time
to
recover
i
suggest
you
think
about
it
he
struggled
to
rise
but
then
realized
he
was
tied
into
the
chair
i
think
you
just
about
beat
me
to
a
pulp
it
was
my
pleasure
moreau
looked
him
over
his
expression
now
definitely
troubled
now
i
should
beat
you
again
for
lying
if
it
all
the
same
i
think
you
might
be
smart
to
keep
me
conscious
for
a
while
longer
maybe
i
can
tell
you
how
to
solve
your
problem
if
you
are
so
wise
then
tell
me
now
moreau
said
with
all
due
respect
i
do
talk
to
messenger
boys
he
tried
to
shift
his
weight
but
his
body
hurt
no
matter
what
he
did
you
would
understand
anyway
it
too
technical
why
do
you
let
me
have
a
chat
with
that
genius
you
got
running
the
computer
he
the
only
one
around
here
who
could
possibly
understand
what
i
talking
about
and
he
the
one
vance
told
himself
who
now
holds
the
key
to
everything
remove
him
and
their
whole
house
of
cards
crumbles
you
mean
the
israeli
he
fairly
spat
out
the
words
he
so
this
operation
is
multinational
peretz
is
handling
the
computer
peretz
is
that
his
name
now
we
getting
somewhere
vance
thought
if
i
can
get
in
the
same
room
with
the
bastard
maybe
i
can
rearrange
his
brain
cells
he
is
supposed
to
be
a
computer
specialist
moreau
voice
betrayed
his
contempt
maybe
he
is
but
he
thinks
he
knows
everything
whenever
anybody
tries
to
tell
him
anything
he
just
laughs
and
makes
bad
jokes
he
wo
listen
to
you
well
why
do
we
give
it
a
shot
anyway
moreau
examined
him
closely
still
skeptical
but
beginning
to
have
second
thoughts
why
would
you
want
to
do
this
anyway
help
us
like
i
told
you
i
figure
you
going
to
end
up
detonating
that
bomb
somewhere
frankly
i
just
as
soon
it
was
fifty
feet
from
where
standing
make
that
sitting
i
do
have
a
small
sense
of
preservation
left
so
why
do
you
do
everybody
a
favor
and
let
me
talk
to
this
peretz
he
has
to
change
the
radio
frequency
that
detonates
the
bomb
to
digital
mode
if
that
thing
is
controlled
with
plain
old
uhf
the
cyclops
may
just
set
it
off
before
it
ever
leaves
the
pad
vance
knew
he
was
talking
over
this
thug
head
he
was
talking
over
his
own
head
but
who
knew
his
fabrication
might
even
be
true
the
story
though
probably
could
use
some
work
look
he
said
finally
why
do
you
raise
him
on
that
and
let
me
talk
to
him
moreau
frowned
at
the
idea
we
gone
to
radio
silence
except
for
emergencies
i
say
this
qualifies
that
remains
to
be
seen
he
paused
i
go
and
tell
him
what
you
said
then
he
can
decide
for
himself
what
he
wants
to
do
i
do
want
to
belabor
the
obvious
here
but
time
is
running
a
little
short
i
be
back
if
he
says
you
are
lying
i
may
just
kill
you
myself
whereupon
he
opened
the
door
and
walked
straight
into
a
befuddled
isaac
mannheim
chapter
fifteen
they
had
used
the
same
insertion
procedure
off
beirut
three
years
earlier
so
there
was
nothing
about
this
that
was
new
standard
procedure
as
had
been
planned
all
along
they
donned
scuba
gear
at
five
hundred
meters
out
packed
their
equipment
in
waterproof
bags
and
entered
the
churning
water
after
the
raft
was
punctured
obliterating
all
evidence
the
seven
men
of
arm
set
out
underwater
for
the
rugged
shoreline
of
andikythera
their
scuba
gear
was
invisible
against
the
dark
sea
as
one
by
one
they
emerged
through
the
breakers
and
into
the
last
remnants
of
rain
from
the
storm
they
faced
a
short
ledge
of
rocks
immediately
abutted
by
a
sheer
granite
cliff
exactly
what
they
expected
indeed
what
they
wanted
they
were
greeted
by
silence
from
up
above
which
gave
lope
that
the
insertion
had
gone
undetected
so
far
they
were
in
with
the
only
problem
being
they
no
longer
had
vance
to
serve
as
point
man
they
would
be
proceeding
blind
but
not
too
blind
back
in
athens
they
had
studied
the
schematics
of
the
facility
carefully
and
had
concluded
the
most
vulnerable
insertion
point
would
be
launch
control
added
to
that
ramirez
was
last
reported
to
be
there
and
the
objective
was
to
take
him
out
as
quickly
and
efficiently
as
possible
that
also
was
the
place
where
they
believed
they
could
shut
down
the
operation
quickest
and
get
their
hands
on
the
weapons
everything
came
together
hit
launch
they
had
discussed
renewing
radio
contact
with
the
woman
named
andros
in
hopes
she
might
be
able
to
give
them
an
update
on
the
disposition
of
the
hostiles
and
friendlies
but
they
decided
to
wait
and
see
first
if
they
could
handle
it
alone
radio
security
was
nonexistent
as
they
had
already
discovered
for
now
the
downside
of
breaking
radio
silence
outweighed
the
upside
later
perhaps
when
it
no
longer
mattered
after
he
had
pulled
off
his
scuba
gear
armont
took
out
his
ir
scope
and
surveyed
the
top
of
the
cliff
and
the
coastline
both
looked
clear
all
right
it
going
to
be
light
soon
he
whispered
let
get
up
there
and
get
to
work
dimitri
spiros
nodded
then
began
donning
an
old
satcom
uniform
he
had
brought
left
over
from
his
days
on
the
island
hoping
to
pass
himself
off
as
a
company
staffer
if
need
be
and
get
in
position
to
act
as
point
man
since
vance
was
not
part
of
the
picture
now
spiros
would
guide
the
unit
in
using
a
secure
radio
to
coordinate
the
overall
operation
with
pierre
and
with
reggie
who
would
be
standoff
sniper
by
the
time
dimitri
was
finished
they
were
ready
marcel
tossed
a
grapple
up
the
side
of
the
steep
cliff
and
it
lodged
somewhere
near
the
top
next
spiros
tested
the
line
then
started
making
his
way
up
inserting
silent
spikes
into
the
crevasses
as
he
climbed
the
granite
was
firm
with
enough
irregularities
to
hold
onto
when
he
reached
the
top
and
signaled
the
the
others
immediately
followed
with
hans
bringing
up
the
rear
after
he
had
secured
the
gear
with
ropes
ready
to
hoist
as
the
last
black
satchel
topped
the
cliff
they
went
to
work
breaking
out
the
hardware
they
would
need
the
light
of
dawn
had
opened
just
enough
for
everybody
to
see
what
they
were
doing
yet
remain
little
more
than
shadows
in
the
early
mist
or
was
it
fog
the
dark
made
it
hard
to
tell
but
it
was
a
magic
moment
that
would
not
last
long
since
reggie
was
the
standoff
sniper
he
normally
would
have
begun
installing
his
ir
scope
but
now
with
dawn
so
near
the
need
for
ir
capability
was
problematical
not
being
seen
was
as
great
a
concern
as
seeing
just
ahead
barely
visible
was
the
fence
since
spiros
had
installed
it
he
strode
ahead
and
did
the
honors
cutting
the
razor
wire
quickly
and
efficiently
with
daylight
approaching
there
was
no
time
for
niceties
such
as
scaling
they
would
just
have
to
take
the
chance
that
the
security
system
was
no
longer
operative
they
carried
the
equipment
through
then
scouted
the
approach
up
the
rocky
hill
they
could
see
two
silver
spires
now
illuminated
with
spotlights
after
a
few
moments
of
thoughtful
silence
reggie
hall
nodded
and
pointed
toward
an
outcropping
of
rocks
located
near
the
north
entrance
to
launch
control
indicating
with
hand
signs
that
they
would
provide
the
best
location
for
overall
surveillance
he
would
set
up
there
a
spot
from
where
he
could
handle
the
sniper
chores
ready
at
any
time
to
neutralize
any
hostiles
who
might
emerge
from
launch
it
also
was
a
good
spot
from
which
to
monitor
hostile
radio
traffic
having
done
this
many
times
before
they
were
ready
armont
and
hans
together
with
the
brothers
voorst
would
lead
the
assault
while
marcel
would
be
at
the
rear
of
the
entry
element
serving
as
defense
man
covering
for
them
and
providing
security
as
point
man
spiros
would
supply
backup
for
marcel
if
things
got
hot
or
if
somebody
tried
to
ambush
the
entry
team
during
approach
and
entry
or
during
withdrawal
the
greek
would
also
be
in
charge
of
directing
any
pyrotechnics
in
addition
to
acting
as
commander
armont
would
assume
his
usual
role
as
security
man
providing
covering
fire
for
the
entry
element
during
the
assault
and
more
close
cover
during
withdrawal
he
also
would
be
in
charge
of
any
other
equipment
they
might
need
since
the
assignments
reflected
arm
standard
configuration
with
everybody
in
their
usual
slot
there
was
no
need
to
squander
time
reviewing
who
would
be
where
in
moments
they
were
ready
silencers
attached
poised
to
move
through
the
dark
early
morning
haze
it
was
providing
a
small
semblance
of
cover
but
not
for
long
they
hoped
they
could
take
launch
control
fast
enough
that
there
would
be
no
time
for
the
terrorists
to
use
hostages
as
human
shields
if
that
happened
there
was
sure
to
be
bloodshed
just
to
be
on
the
safe
side
armont
did
a
quick
of
the
assault
with
hand
signals
he
was
just
finishing
when
reggie
radio
came
alive
in
a
burst
of
static
sirene
please
come
in
it
was
a
woman
voice
do
you
read
blast
he
whispered
his
face
rapidly
turning
florid
in
the
dim
mist
did
we
tell
her
radio
silence
was
essential
he
quickly
switched
on
the
microphone
ulysses
one
get
off
this
channel
sirene
is
here
thank
god
but
you
got
to
try
and
find
mike
isaac
went
to
look
for
him
but
he
has
come
back
you
mean
mannheim
armont
took
the
microphone
where
did
he
go
he
said
he
was
going
to
try
the
empty
loading
bays
down
at
launch
she
said
he
has
come
back
so
maybe
he
found
him
could
you
try
there
reggie
turned
to
armont
with
a
questioning
look
that
needed
no
words
it
was
simply
what
do
we
do
now
on
this
one
armont
had
no
better
idea
than
anyone
else
they
all
knew
where
the
loading
bays
were
since
the
blueprints
had
made
that
plain
enough
the
problem
was
the
sequence
should
they
go
ahead
with
the
assault
as
planned
to
take
the
time
to
try
to
find
him
and
pull
him
out
her
intel
on
his
location
was
just
a
guess
but
it
was
a
start
arm
rules
always
had
been
that
their
own
people
came
first
so
if
they
knew
where
vance
might
possibly
be
nothing
else
mattered
according
to
the
rules
they
had
to
drop
everything
and
try
to
pull
him
out
even
if
it
jeopardized
the
operation
those
were
the
rules
no
exceptions
for
that
matter
armont
suddenly
thought
why
not
try
and
bring
her
in
out
of
the
cold
too
then
they
would
have
a
personal
guide
to
the
whole
layout
it
seemed
to
make
a
lot
of
sense
particularly
since
radio
security
was
already
shot
to
hell
he
clicked
on
the
microphone
again
can
you
meet
us
there
where
you
think
he
is
copy
give
me
eight
minutes
and
the
radio
clicked
off
i
hope
we
got
eight
to
spare
armont
thought
checking
his
krieger
watch
the
minutes
were
ticking
away
okay
we
change
the
plan
he
whispered
we
make
the
insertion
through
the
loading
bays
he
nodded
to
hans
and
the
voorst
brothers
and
without
so
much
as
a
word
they
tightened
their
black
hoods
and
headed
up
through
the
mist
she
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
as
she
put
down
the
microphone
and
prepared
to
stumble
down
the
hill
she
realized
she
had
violated
protocol
by
breaking
radio
silence
but
she
was
almost
as
worried
about
michael
vance
as
she
was
about
the
facility
and
it
was
a
disturbing
realization
or
maybe
not
so
disturbing
true
he
had
screwed
up
but
then
everybody
did
that
from
time
to
time
even
alan
there
it
was
again
but
come
on
the
resemblance
was
almost
scary
and
she
was
also
beginning
to
hate
him
for
the
same
reasons
she
had
hated
alan
it
was
the
anger
and
maybe
the
guilt
she
had
told
them
eight
minutes
so
get
moving
it
was
going
to
be
tight
first
find
mike
and
isaac
if
that
was
possible
and
then
go
on
to
the
real
business
of
the
morning
whoever
was
on
the
fujitsu
had
to
be
stopped
even
if
it
meant
more
damage
to
the
facility
the
cost
no
longer
mattered
satcom
could
be
rebuilt
everything
but
if
one
of
those
third
world
bombs
were
set
off
somewhere
it
would
be
another
hiroshima
the
horror
of
it
would
be
unthinkable
she
prayed
a
short
prayer
something
she
had
done
in
years
and
started
down
the
hill
out
the
wide
windows
of
launch
control
the
illuminated
spires
of
and
gleamed
through
the
early
mist
sabri
ramirez
studied
them
thinking
about
logistics
with
all
the
scrambled
radio
traffic
in
the
area
he
had
a
sneaking
suspicion
more
than
a
suspicion
that
a
special
forces
assault
was
being
set
up
but
that
what
all
the
hostages
were
for
everything
was
on
schedule
just
as
planned
according
to
peretz
the
last
tests
of
the
telemetry
had
been
completed
and
the
countdown
was
proceeding
without
a
hold
outside
in
the
vast
bay
that
was
launch
technicians
buzzed
a
sea
of
white
coats
lines
of
workstations
showed
voltage
and
amperage
values
for
the
power
buildup
in
the
coil
calculations
of
wind
shear
were
being
made
and
preliminary
tests
were
being
run
on
the
guidance
system
the
orbops
team
orbital
operations
was
busy
running
up
orbital
and
attitude
numbers
readying
their
input
commands
the
irony
was
they
still
did
have
a
clue
they
were
about
to
send
up
a
nuclear
device
american
ingenuity
turned
on
itself
in
a
fearsome
symmetry
a
look
at
what
i
found
ramirez
whirled
hearing
the
voice
and
was
startled
to
see
moreau
coming
in
through
the
doorway
of
launch
control
leading
the
old
jew
professor
isaac
mannheim
where
did
he
come
from
the
old
man
was
supposed
to
be
sedated
and
sequestered
away
for
safekeeping
in
the
living
quarters
guess
it
had
worked
here
he
was
bumbling
about
on
the
other
hand
maybe
this
was
a
stroke
of
timing
he
was
about
to
be
needed
again
and
this
saved
the
trouble
of
having
to
go
and
get
him
where
was
he
wandering
around
the
loading
docks
said
still
shoving
mannheim
ahead
of
him
i
think
there
a
technical
question
we
need
to
run
by
him
what
that
bastard
vance
just
claimed
that
the
cyclops
laser
may
set
off
the
device
when
it
starts
up
i
did
get
it
exactly
he
wants
to
talk
to
peretz
something
about
plasma
and
stray
radio
frequencies
sounds
like
an
invention
to
me
ramirez
said
looking
mannheim
over
the
old
man
his
baseball
cap
askew
was
clearly
as
mad
as
a
loon
what
would
he
know
about
anything
on
the
other
hand
he
was
a
scientist
so
it
would
hurt
to
ask
well
what
about
it
herr
doctor
professor
he
walked
over
and
straightened
the
old
man
cap
is
your
laser
going
to
produce
random
radio
signals
of
course
not
mannheim
declared
what
is
so
ideal
about
this
system
there
nothing
to
interfere
with
the
telemetry
no
static
no
i
thought
so
moreau
muttered
cutting
him
off
with
a
flourish
of
his
blond
hair
he
turned
to
go
back
to
the
loading
bay
i
leaving
him
here
vance
was
lying
just
as
i
thought
he
going
to
regret
the
on
ramirez
belt
crackled
and
he
grabbed
it
instantly
what
do
you
want
i
ordered
radio
silence
firebird
one
this
is
hacker
came
the
voice
of
peretz
i
turned
on
the
security
system
for
a
and
lo
and
behold
i
think
there
a
possible
penetration
in
progress
down
on
the
south
shore
in
sector
of
the
fence
could
be
a
malfunction
but
maybe
somebody
ought
to
check
it
out
ramirez
groaned
silently
was
this
the
assault
he
had
been
half
expecting
if
so
it
was
coming
quicker
than
he
had
planned
which
meant
that
having
mannheim
here
was
definitely
a
stroke
of
luck
wait
he
motioned
for
moreau
who
had
turned
and
was
headed
through
the
doorway
i
want
you
here
till
we
find
out
what
this
is
could
be
a
false
alarm
but
then
maybe
not
okay
he
thought
quickly
where
is
everybody
time
to
batten
down
peretz
of
course
was
in
command
along
with
salim
wolf
helling
was
here
in
launch
coordinating
telemetry
between
peretz
and
the
pakistanis
stelios
was
keeping
tabs
on
the
prisoners
now
in
the
living
quarters
the
bates
motel
jamal
was
on
patrol
around
the
perimeter
why
had
he
noticed
anything
together
with
the
two
stasi
and
was
here
the
first
thing
to
do
would
be
to
raise
jamal
on
the
radio
and
have
him
check
out
the
situation
there
in
the
south
and
if
it
really
was
a
penetration
then
the
two
most
expendable
members
of
the
team
right
now
were
the
stasi
they
were
the
cannon
fodder
let
them
earn
their
share
all
right
he
said
to
peretz
we
check
it
out
four
while
watched
he
quickly
raised
jamal
on
the
and
repeated
what
peretz
had
said
it
could
be
a
malfunction
of
the
sensors
but
who
the
hell
knows
if
this
is
the
real
thing
then
have
to
take
steps
but
once
we
escalate
everything
is
going
to
get
more
complicated
i
have
schindler
check
it
out
and
get
back
to
you
in
three
minutes
jamal
barked
back
we
keep
the
line
open
till
i
know
for
sure
what
going
on
all
right
but
you
better
get
ready
for
trouble
my
hunch
is
that
this
may
be
the
beginning
if
it
is
then
we
got
our
work
cut
out
you
know
what
i
mean
he
clicked
it
off
then
turned
to
okay
forget
about
vance
for
now
i
want
you
to
go
over
to
command
and
help
salim
get
the
security
into
shape
i
not
sure
he
knows
what
the
hell
he
doing
check
moreau
said
i
take
care
of
everything
he
walked
out
the
door
and
into
launch
then
headed
for
the
tunnel
leading
to
command
ramirez
he
knew
had
a
contingency
that
was
supposed
to
stop
an
assault
in
its
tracks
he
only
hoped
it
would
work
as
planned
as
she
moved
down
the
hill
dawn
was
beginning
to
show
dimly
through
the
fog
to
the
east
promising
an
early
morning
clearing
of
the
skies
the
prospect
made
her
fearful
the
dark
had
been
better
a
shroud
to
cover
mistakes
now
without
the
fog
she
would
be
almost
as
exposed
as
the
barren
rocks
that
pockmarked
the
hillside
the
birds
this
morning
were
strangely
silent
as
though
they
knew
ill
doings
were
afoot
even
the
pale
glimpse
of
and
down
at
the
other
end
of
the
island
had
never
seemed
more
plaintive
she
had
worked
for
almost
three
years
to
put
those
vehicles
into
space
and
now
she
had
to
try
and
stop
the
very
thing
she
had
been
aiming
for
all
that
time
she
had
told
the
arm
team
she
could
be
there
in
eight
minutes
but
now
she
realized
that
was
optimistic
though
she
was
moving
as
fast
as
she
could
manage
hugging
the
line
of
the
security
fence
the
island
seemed
to
be
getting
bigger
all
the
time
and
smaller
the
fence
which
had
seemed
so
reassuring
when
it
was
installed
wove
among
the
trees
and
rocks
as
it
went
down
the
hill
almost
a
meandering
presence
but
it
was
not
hard
to
follow
even
in
the
reduced
visibility
of
the
and
fog
the
trick
she
realized
was
going
to
be
finding
the
arm
team
or
maybe
they
would
find
her
finding
things
was
what
they
were
supposed
to
be
good
at
thank
god
there
was
somebody
up
ahead
barely
visible
through
the
dim
light
only
one
however
which
immediately
made
her
wonder
she
paused
drew
a
deep
lungful
of
the
fresh
morning
air
and
waited
to
see
what
he
would
do
for
one
thing
he
was
moving
along
as
though
he
was
searching
yet
with
an
air
of
owning
the
terrain
shit
it
was
one
of
ramirez
men
out
on
patrol
she
recognized
him
it
was
one
of
the
european
hoods
who
had
barged
into
command
the
fateful
evening
now
half
a
lifetime
away
quickly
she
tried
to
melt
into
the
shadow
of
a
tall
bush
but
she
was
too
late
his
head
jerked
around
and
he
saw
her
up
came
an
automatic
he
was
dressed
in
black
and
as
he
approached
her
he
flashed
a
crooked
smile
then
produced
a
german
accent
so
it
you
we
been
missing
you
which
one
of
them
are
you
she
did
know
what
else
to
say
i
am
max
schindler
he
replied
in
heavily
accented
english
he
was
at
least
thirty
pounds
overweight
the
rewards
of
a
lifetime
of
potatoes
and
strudel
he
looked
like
a
puffing
black
balloon
number
one
vill
be
pleased
to
have
you
return
to
us
he
thought
you
were
an
assault
he
laughed
as
he
gestured
her
forward
with
the
weapon
come
on
this
morning
i
think
is
going
to
go
quickly
just
another
couple
of
hours
and
the
real
excitement
will
begin
i
can
hardly
wait
good
it
sounded
more
like
goot
you
are
going
to
have
a
seat
he
seemed
extremely
pleased
with
himself
both
with
his
own
humor
and
with
the
fact
that
he
had
been
the
one
who
would
be
bringing
her
back
you
mean
ringside
great
the
time
was
already
flashing
by
she
thought
the
eight
minutes
she
had
given
arm
were
undoubtedly
up
which
meant
they
probably
would
be
changing
plans
again
working
their
way
would
they
just
forget
about
her
and
move
on
tell
me
how
did
a
smart
guy
like
you
end
up
working
for
a
maniac
like
ramirez
who
guy
you
call
number
one
i
hear
he
really
sabri
ramirez
you
know
the
german
startled
look
betrayed
his
disbelief
his
small
eyes
narrowed
who
told
you
such
a
thing
just
a
little
birdie
schindler
shrugged
unconvinced
then
pushed
her
on
impossible
everybody
knows
sabri
ramirez
has
been
dead
for
two
maybe
three
years
well
she
thought
with
any
luck
he
soon
will
be
whatever
you
say
she
continued
it
absurd
ramirez
was
south
american
number
one
is
from
beirut
now
come
on
hurry
just
keep
your
hands
where
i
can
see
them
schindler
was
almost
shoving
her
around
a
rocky
outcrop
we
have
to
get
up
to
launch
before
he
gets
impatient
and
sends
somebody
else
out
looking
well
if
you
in
such
a
big
rush
there
a
quicker
way
to
get
into
launch
than
the
way
we
going
we
can
just
enter
through
the
loading
bays
she
pointed
up
there
we
do
have
to
go
all
the
way
around
are
they
unlocked
he
looked
up
and
squinted
through
the
mist
the
bays
were
distinguishable
by
tall
metal
doors
that
were
sized
to
accommodate
some
of
the
large
vehicle
components
that
had
been
delivered
over
the
past
couple
of
years
they
could
just
be
seen
now
dark
silhouettes
against
the
horizon
the
big
doors
are
probably
locked
but
there
a
side
entrance
always
open
she
paused
do
what
you
want
but
i
guarantee
you
quicker
than
going
around
all
right
he
nodded
a
quick
bob
of
his
beefy
neck
you
lead
the
way
what
she
really
was
thinking
about
was
the
rocks
and
trees
covering
that
back
route
this
german
blimp
escorting
her
would
be
no
match
if
she
simply
took
matters
into
her
own
hands
and
made
a
dash
why
not
it
was
a
desperate
move
but
this
was
a
desperate
moment
wait
she
bent
over
as
though
to
tie
a
shoelace
and
when
she
came
up
she
was
swinging
schindler
was
tired
and
perhaps
because
of
that
he
was
caught
completely
off
guard
staggering
backward
it
was
the
moment
of
disorientation
she
needed
she
grabbed
at
the
uzi
hoping
to
wrench
it
from
his
grasp
he
may
have
been
surprised
and
overweight
but
he
had
lost
none
of
his
dogged
stasi
tenacity
his
handed
grip
tightened
on
the
weapon
as
his
other
hand
flew
up
to
defend
his
face
now
she
had
one
hand
on
the
breech
of
the
automatic
and
with
the
other
she
reached
out
and
seized
the
muzzle
it
was
the
leverage
she
needed
to
swing
the
butt
of
the
metal
stock
up
against
his
jaw
the
blow
caught
him
with
his
mouth
open
smashing
his
lower
lip
against
his
teeth
and
slicing
his
tongue
he
emitted
a
moan
and
yanked
the
uzi
away
with
both
hands
but
now
calypso
andros
was
already
stumbling
through
the
brush
up
the
hill
and
into
the
fog
schindler
felt
his
bleeding
lip
as
he
recovered
his
balance
and
he
fleetingly
considered
just
taking
her
out
with
a
quick
burst
nice
and
simple
though
number
one
had
insisted
she
be
returned
alive
he
told
himself
he
was
mad
enough
he
did
care
he
wanted
to
kill
the
bitch
but
the
second
he
took
to
make
that
calculation
proved
to
be
crucial
she
had
gotten
into
the
heavy
brush
that
ringed
the
hill
farther
up
he
plunged
after
her
puffing
and
seething
it
was
one
thing
not
to
have
found
her
it
was
another
to
have
had
her
within
his
grasp
and
then
let
her
escape
he
would
be
a
laughingstock
again
wolf
helling
who
had
given
him
this
job
would
be
humiliated
once
more
it
was
unacceptable
unthinkable
the
rocks
along
the
fenceline
were
jagged
cutting
into
his
boots
as
he
half
ran
half
stumbled
through
the
dim
light
she
was
up
there
somewhere
she
had
said
something
about
the
loading
bay
so
she
probably
was
headed
there
in
any
case
there
were
that
many
places
to
hide
it
was
just
a
matter
of
time
just
a
matter
of
time
ramirez
was
talking
to
peretz
again
on
his
i
been
monitoring
the
scrambled
radio
traffic
and
i
begun
to
have
a
sixth
sense
about
the
situation
i
think
we
about
to
have
some
uninvited
guests
from
the
special
forces
ten
to
one
it
delta
are
you
ready
just
came
in
and
he
says
we
totally
secure
baby
satcom
thoughtfully
lined
this
place
with
steel
ai
nobody
gon
na
waltz
into
this
little
enclave
of
ours
without
a
press
pass
rest
easy
man
keep
cool
well
i
thinking
i
should
send
you
some
more
backup
just
in
case
what
i
really
should
do
is
shoot
you
and
just
use
the
backup
by
the
way
how
does
the
schedule
look
the
countdown
now
being
handled
entirely
by
the
computer
so
far
there
are
no
holds
is
coming
up
exactly
as
scheduled
good
ramirez
spoke
back
keep
me
updated
on
a
minute
framework
he
paused
thinking
incidentally
is
there
any
way
we
possibly
could
speed
it
up
things
are
pretty
tight
as
they
stand
there
might
be
some
shortcuts
but
i
not
sure
i
know
this
system
well
enough
to
start
fooling
around
if
it
ai
broke
do
fix
it
know
what
i
mean
an
original
sentiment
ramirez
responded
dryly
but
do
be
surprised
at
anything
that
may
happen
here
in
the
next
ninety
minutes
there
may
be
a
setup
for
an
assault
but
i
take
care
of
it
it
a
tough
game
coming
down
here
but
ai
nobody
gon
na
fuck
with
us
we
got
all
the
big
cards
they
may
try
it
though
so
make
sure
that
place
is
tight
and
have
and
salim
all
the
entries
the
chances
are
good
we
going
to
take
a
hit
and
soon
no
problem
from
down
here
i
told
you
we
covering
it
what
do
you
know
you
ramirez
asked
himself
grimly
all
right
but
as
soon
as
jamal
checks
in
i
sending
him
over
there
too
and
one
of
the
stasi
stelios
can
handle
the
living
quarters
by
himself
just
keep
the
countdown
going
no
matter
what
else
happens
okay
but
the
only
way
this
thing
is
gon
na
fly
is
if
you
made
those
bank
arrangements
the
way
i
wanted
one
hand
washes
the
other
as
the
saying
goes
otherwise
i
just
going
to
shut
the
whole
thing
down
i
mean
it
man
it
has
been
taken
care
of
ramirez
said
i
faxed
geneva
they
just
opened
that
desk
but
i
should
have
a
confirmation
back
in
a
few
minutes
with
that
announcement
he
clicked
off
the
mike
and
smiled
peretz
memo
had
explained
he
was
demanding
blackmail
what
he
wanted
was
more
like
an
equitable
readjustment
of
the
take
and
why
not
the
memo
had
reasoned
without
his
computer
skills
nothing
could
have
been
possible
he
wanted
written
proof
that
when
the
ransom
money
came
in
it
would
automatically
be
split
with
half
going
to
a
new
account
he
specified
what
an
amateur
it
was
almost
depressing
she
stumbled
through
the
brush
wondering
where
they
were
they
must
have
come
in
from
the
south
which
meant
they
were
already
near
the
entrance
to
the
loading
bay
go
for
that
she
told
herself
pushing
on
the
bramble
was
scraping
her
face
and
hands
tearing
her
clothes
she
was
going
to
look
like
she
been
run
through
a
shredder
she
thought
a
bloody
mess
then
she
heard
something
whiz
by
the
first
shot
and
knew
the
german
was
closing
in
his
weapon
on
semiauto
with
a
rush
of
desperation
she
threw
herself
on
the
ground
and
tried
to
merge
with
the
damp
leaves
and
underbrush
and
she
felt
terrible
mike
had
screwed
things
up
but
she
had
done
much
better
then
out
of
the
mist
just
up
the
hill
a
figure
appeared
two
figures
three
moving
with
quick
catlike
motions
she
wanted
to
yell
to
warn
them
but
maybe
all
she
would
be
doing
was
alerting
the
damned
german
hood
trying
to
kill
her
no
they
were
supposed
to
be
professionals
so
let
them
handle
it
their
own
way
then
she
heard
another
whiz
of
a
round
singing
by
and
saw
a
fleck
of
dirt
fly
up
only
inches
from
where
she
lay
again
the
hard
crack
of
the
german
automatic
followed
all
right
arm
you
supposed
to
be
such
hotshots
do
something
and
do
it
now
the
three
dark
figures
answered
the
shots
as
though
they
were
in
a
ballet
all
dropping
to
a
crouch
virtually
in
unison
they
were
using
silencers
so
the
rounds
came
as
a
series
of
dull
thunks
but
each
figure
fired
only
once
or
at
most
twice
and
when
she
turned
to
look
back
her
pursuer
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
no
he
was
slumped
over
a
bush
motionless
as
one
of
the
hooded
figures
came
up
to
her
and
began
lifting
her
to
her
feet
two
of
the
others
advanced
cautiously
on
the
german
their
caution
however
was
unnecessary
he
was
as
lifeless
as
the
granite
rocks
around
them
well
she
thought
these
guys
sure
know
how
to
treat
a
lady
jamal
cursed
the
morning
fog
that
had
settled
in
understanding
it
was
probably
moisture
left
over
from
the
storm
then
he
checked
his
watch
and
realized
that
schindler
was
overdue
which
was
typical
he
was
beginning
to
wonder
how
the
german
nation
had
acquired
its
famous
reputation
for
punctuality
and
efficiency
both
were
in
his
opinion
grossly
undeserved
helling
recommendation
that
those
three
be
brought
along
did
not
reflect
well
on
his
judgment
he
clicked
on
his
firebird
six
do
you
copy
is
everything
cq
where
you
are
it
time
there
was
no
answer
the
jerk
had
gone
down
by
the
south
security
fence
where
something
was
amiss
was
he
in
trouble
everybody
was
tied
up
now
getting
ready
for
the
launch
he
wondered
if
they
were
going
to
find
themselves
shorthanded
not
having
as
much
firepower
as
they
needed
firebird
six
come
in
cut
the
games
again
silence
which
gave
him
a
very
bad
feeling
there
was
no
reason
for
the
radio
to
conk
out
suddenly
the
rule
was
they
always
kept
their
channels
open
this
was
trouble
time
to
alert
ramirez
either
schindler
had
fucked
up
or
they
had
been
penetrated
major
general
eric
nichols
was
so
relieved
he
scarcely
knew
whether
to
laugh
or
cry
and
he
rarely
had
been
seen
to
do
either
actually
his
feeling
was
more
one
of
surprise
for
once
something
was
going
right
after
diddling
and
dabbling
for
almost
ten
hours
the
pentagon
fort
had
actually
made
a
decision
it
was
so
unprecedented
it
might
even
merit
a
place
in
the
annals
of
military
history
such
rare
moments
were
to
be
savored
maybe
they
had
gotten
tired
of
running
computer
risk
analyses
or
maybe
their
damned
computer
had
broken
down
whatever
the
reason
however
the
exalted
pay
grades
upstairs
had
decided
to
get
off
dead
center
and
just
let
him
assault
the
damned
island
the
op
was
a
go
the
civilian
assholes
had
been
headed
off
at
the
pass
which
meant
one
less
thing
to
worry
about
now
all
that
remained
was
to
figure
how
to
get
the
boys
in
safely
and
take
down
the
place
and
at
last
he
knew
there
were
nukes
great
communication
system
the
army
had
making
sure
everybody
had
been
briefed
and
was
totally
up
to
speed
christ
he
sat
still
a
moment
after
setting
down
the
phone
breathing
a
short
prayer
although
appearances
would
not
suggest
it
he
was
in
fact
a
religious
man
at
the
core
he
had
been
close
enough
to
death
enough
times
to
conclude
that
there
were
indeed
no
atheists
in
foxholes
and
he
figured
what
was
good
enough
for
foxholes
was
good
enough
for
the
rest
of
the
time
besides
what
harm
did
it
do
all
right
he
turned
and
glanced
at
max
austin
i
guess
the
computer
has
got
everything
planned
looks
like
we
can
go
in
after
all
that
for
efficiency
just
as
it
gets
bright
enough
for
my
guys
to
be
risking
their
asses
we
get
the
green
light
i
say
that
just
about
perfect
timing
austin
nodded
slowly
then
rose
to
check
the
teletype
machine
to
see
if
the
orders
had
really
come
through
this
op
was
going
to
be
by
the
book
or
not
at
all
if
it
turned
into
a
nuclear
incident
there
were
going
to
be
inquiries
up
the
wazoo
looks
like
it
really
going
down
austin
said
yanking
off
a
sheet
so
i
cut
the
orders
and
get
us
mobilized
here
how
long
before
you
can
get
your
boys
in
the
air
well
since
this
is
going
to
have
to
be
a
daylight
op
we
might
as
well
use
the
apaches
and
not
fuck
around
we
just
hit
the
bastards
with
enough
firepower
to
take
out
the
radars
up
on
the
hill
that
ought
to
shut
down
any
chance
they
could
get
anything
launched
then
we
just
got
a
hostage
situation
to
deal
with
and
if
we
have
to
we
can
just
starve
them
out
it
only
be
a
matter
of
time
maybe
god
willing
we
can
keep
the
friendly
casualties
to
a
minimum
austin
did
not
like
the
image
of
the
headlines
nichols
assault
plan
suddenly
conjured
up
any
heavy
property
damage
and
there
was
going
to
be
hell
to
pay
i
do
like
it
eric
he
said
the
word
i
get
is
that
we
not
to
damage
the
infrastructure
any
more
than
is
absolutely
essential
which
means
no
first
strikes
on
this
is
iraq
for
godsake
this
is
american
property
you
saying
my
main
orders
are
to
save
the
infrastructure
nichols
tone
was
deliberately
wry
you
got
it
i
want
you
to
get
in
there
fast
take
down
the
hostiles
and
get
this
situation
the
hell
over
with
that
the
best
way
to
put
this
problem
behind
us
and
fast
the
last
thing
this
army
needs
is
a
month
worth
of
gory
headlines
some
quick
casualties
can
look
unavoidable
and
be
over
with
in
a
day
a
situation
can
make
us
all
look
like
jerks
i
ca
believe
i
hearing
this
you
did
hear
a
damned
thing
at
least
not
from
me
but
if
you
know
what
good
for
the
army
and
for
the
country
you
get
in
there
and
take
down
the
place
in
a
morning
neutralize
the
hostiles
with
extreme
prejudice
and
let
the
army
write
the
headlines
with
a
press
release
nichols
knew
what
he
was
hearing
the
groundwork
for
deniability
and
he
despised
it
this
kind
of
cover
your
ass
bullshit
was
one
of
the
things
that
gave
him
such
contempt
for
desk
jockeys
all
right
he
said
smoothly
covering
his
disgust
if
you
want
to
play
it
that
way
then
we
can
sure
as
hell
do
it
i
do
suppose
my
opinion
in
the
matter
is
of
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
interest
to
the
pentagon
truthfully
no
okay
he
leaned
back
doing
it
the
pentagon
way
there
would
be
two
points
we
need
to
assault
there
the
computer
control
center
and
then
there
the
launch
facility
there
probably
terrorists
at
both
so
we
got
to
take
down
both
locations
simultaneously
and
both
unfortunately
are
underground
which
also
means
we
got
to
figure
out
how
to
get
in
get
down
there
and
do
it
fast
what
would
be
your
insertion
strategy
given
what
we
just
discussed
well
i
already
got
the
alternatives
rehearsed
right
now
i
think
we
should
stage
a
diversionary
landing
on
the
coast
by
a
seal
team
then
use
the
confusion
to
let
the
main
assault
team
insert
from
choppers
my
main
worry
is
not
the
hostages
but
getting
my
own
boys
shot
up
going
in
it
going
to
be
a
if
some
of
those
bastards
can
get
a
bead
on
the
task
force
that
arriving
by
chopper
could
mean
a
lot
of
casualties
let
something
go
wrong
and
i
do
even
want
to
think
about
how
many
of
my
men
could
get
chewed
up
but
been
rehearsing
that
assault
option
and
i
think
we
can
get
twenty
men
on
the
ground
in
about
ninety
seconds
the
difference
he
was
thinking
was
that
he
had
been
planning
to
do
it
under
cover
of
darkness
to
suddenly
have
to
revise
the
entire
strategy
and
try
and
take
down
the
place
in
broad
daylight
was
calling
every
assumption
into
question
but
there
was
no
time
to
try
and
devise
yet
another
assault
shit
all
because
washington
kept
changing
its
signals
and
when
it
did
get
them
straight
somebody
came
up
with
this
bullshit
about
minimizing
property
damage
it
was
a
goddamn
outrage
but
that
what
you
had
to
expect
when
remfs
got
mixed
up
in
planning
an
op
shit
well
twenty
men
should
do
it
austin
said
and
there
always
be
backup
from
the
seal
team
that
providing
the
coastal
diversion
they
be
there
so
to
speak
right
you
do
know
about
how
an
op
like
this
goes
down
nichols
was
thinking
and
you
have
the
balls
to
sit
there
and
tell
me
how
to
deploy
my
resources
on
the
other
hand
it
sounds
easy
too
easy
that
what
wrong
with
it
the
place
would
appear
to
be
a
crackerbox
but
these
bastards
are
pros
so
they
must
already
have
thought
through
everything
we
have
time
to
plan
ahead
of
them
all
right
nichols
concluded
rising
i
have
everybody
airborne
in
fifteen
minutes
vance
twisted
around
and
tried
to
see
his
watch
he
could
make
out
the
hands
but
they
both
seemed
to
be
pointing
in
the
general
direction
of
down
whatever
that
meant
exactly
the
time
had
to
be
getting
on
toward
dawn
the
six
hours
that
cally
had
talked
about
the
six
hours
left
before
the
liftoff
how
much
of
that
time
was
left
it
had
to
be
half
gone
what
now
maybe
his
story
had
impressed
the
french
hood
enough
to
get
him
out
of
the
room
for
a
while
but
it
was
going
to
cut
any
ice
with
anybody
who
knew
anything
about
lasers
sooner
or
later
he
was
going
to
come
back
not
something
to
let
the
mind
dwell
on
one
thing
was
sure
he
felt
like
he
had
been
run
over
by
a
truck
the
blood
from
the
beating
was
slowly
starting
to
coagulate
crusting
on
his
face
it
had
begun
to
itch
and
something
where
his
liver
used
to
be
was
emitting
stabbing
bursts
of
pain
it
would
come
then
subside
then
come
again
he
tried
to
focus
his
eyes
on
the
room
the
piles
of
empty
crates
wondering
if
maybe
a
sharp
object
was
protruding
somewhere
maybe
something
he
could
use
to
cut
away
at
the
cord
that
held
his
hands
nothing
and
it
was
a
stupid
idea
anyway
left
over
from
too
many
b
movies
but
now
his
mind
was
beginning
to
attempt
to
function
with
a
little
more
rationality
and
along
with
that
came
the
glimmerings
of
an
idea
the
bomb
was
aboard
one
of
the
vehicles
and
a
countdown
was
under
way
now
being
handled
by
bill
supercomputer
there
was
no
obvious
way
to
stop
it
maybe
however
there
was
a
way
a
minute
reprieve
assuming
he
ever
got
the
chance
he
groaned
and
leaned
back
wondering
what
happened
next
came
so
fast
he
could
really
comprehend
it
at
the
time
only
later
could
he
roughly
reconstruct
the
dizzying
confluence
of
events
but
that
was
as
it
should
have
been
the
door
was
suddenly
slammed
wide
and
two
smoke
grenades
plummeted
into
the
room
followed
by
a
flash
grenade
next
through
the
smoke
and
confusion
three
men
dressed
in
black
pullovers
plunged
through
the
opening
and
dropped
to
their
knees
at
the
ready
jesus
he
gasped
for
breath
blinded
by
the
flash
grenade
but
still
trying
to
see
through
the
billowing
cs
that
was
engulfing
everything
in
what
seemed
like
less
than
a
second
one
of
the
men
appeared
by
his
side
and
he
saw
a
knife
blade
flash
a
hand
was
slapped
over
his
mouth
as
another
rough
set
of
hands
yanked
him
from
the
chair
his
legs
were
numb
from
the
bindings
but
they
came
alive
as
his
weight
went
back
onto
them
terra
firma
had
never
felt
better
the
men
faces
were
all
covered
in
balaclavas
but
one
of
them
gave
two
sharp
clicks
and
on
that
signal
they
began
to
drag
him
out
the
door
he
knew
better
than
to
say
a
word
the
whole
operation
had
been
carried
out
with
clockwork
precision
and
in
perfect
silence
except
for
the
destruction
of
the
door
had
there
been
any
terrorists
in
the
room
they
would
have
been
dead
scarcely
knowing
what
had
happened
as
they
entered
the
hallway
one
of
the
men
pulled
back
his
antismoke
hood
you
look
like
hell
willem
voorst
said
can
you
walk
in
a
manner
of
speaking
he
felt
pain
shooting
up
through
his
wobbly
legs
i
suppose
i
should
ask
what
took
you
so
long
only
it
hurts
to
talk
you
were
scheduled
in
for
another
day
what
happened
we
moved
up
the
timetable
though
you
be
amazed
how
many
people
did
want
us
to
show
up
marcel
remarked
his
belgian
calm
returning
the
entire
navy
to
be
exact
we
were
made
to
feel
very
unwanted
that
going
to
seem
like
a
welcome
wagon
compared
to
what
coming
up
he
paused
and
tried
to
inhale
the
comparatively
smokeless
air
of
the
hallway
what
the
plan
do
you
want
to
try
and
take
out
launch
control
or
do
you
want
to
move
on
command
that
was
when
he
saw
cally
how
did
you
get
down
here
somebody
had
to
lead
these
guys
in
she
said
factly
her
face
was
scratched
and
her
shirt
torn
no
thanks
to
you
all
we
have
to
thank
you
for
is
blowing
up
the
gantry
he
just
groaned
things
got
complicated
but
you
waited
until
it
moved
over
the
explosive
before
you
blew
it
i
saw
the
whole
thing
how
could
you
be
so
crazy
her
anger
was
boiling
that
was
what
we
agreed
to
like
i
said
things
please
give
me
a
break
if
you
worked
for
me
i
fire
you
on
the
spot
it
was
clear
she
meant
every
word
so
after
you
screwed
that
up
what
was
i
supposed
to
do
i
had
no
choice
but
to
get
on
the
radio
now
look
at
the
mess
we
in
what
happened
to
tell
you
the
truth
vance
answered
i
not
even
quite
sure
myself
great
just
great
it
a
jungle
out
there
no
kidding
later
i
tell
all
he
said
lamely
wanting
desperately
to
change
the
subject
right
now
though
there
the
matter
of
ramirez
and
by
the
way
it
is
him
we
had
a
what
did
he
tell
you
armont
asked
his
interest
suddenly
alive
did
he
say
what
he
wanted
out
of
all
this
ransom
or
what
we
did
make
it
that
far
a
personality
conflict
got
in
the
way
no
hint
nothing
just
that
he
knows
exactly
what
he
doing
they
going
to
launch
an
atomic
bomb
kill
a
lot
of
people
somewhere
and
i
do
think
the
payment
of
ransom
is
going
to
make
them
call
it
off
they
going
to
take
the
money
then
go
ahead
and
do
it
anyway
he
rubbed
a
hand
across
his
face
trying
to
feel
a
cut
then
drew
it
away
and
examined
the
blood
in
the
not
quite
sure
what
he
was
seeing
but
i
still
think
that
if
we
take
him
out
the
rest
of
them
will
fold
he
looked
at
cally
trying
to
meet
the
outraged
glare
she
was
bestowing
on
him
any
idea
where
he
is
now
last
i
knew
he
was
in
launch
she
said
still
visibly
fuming
then
i
guess
that
the
first
objective
jesus
do
you
want
to
go
in
shooting
she
looked
around
at
the
motley
men
of
arm
those
are
my
people
in
there
you
know
my
friends
it
could
be
a
bloodbath
does
have
to
be
spiros
had
pulled
back
his
balaclava
and
was
shaking
vance
hand
with
an
air
of
genuine
contrition
maybe
trying
to
cheer
him
up
after
cally
andros
blast
michael
i
damned
sorry
about
all
this
the
whole
thing
is
my
fault
really
spilt
milk
vance
replied
now
we
have
to
look
ahead
well
it
my
spilt
milk
as
you
say
spiros
declared
and
i
want
to
clean
it
up
myself
if
all
we
need
to
do
is
take
down
ramirez
i
think
i
can
get
in
there
and
maybe
do
it
without
too
much
in
the
way
of
pyrotechnics
what
do
you
mean
armont
asked
let
me
go
in
by
myself
alone
i
got
a
uniform
so
i
just
be
another
greek
mechanic
at
least
we
should
try
that
first
see
what
i
can
do
dimitri
that
a
heroic
offer
armont
said
but
no
it
not
heroic
it
realistic
it
a
chance
but
one
i
think
we
should
take
we
do
stay
in
business
by
taking
chances
armont
declared
vetoing
him
on
the
spot
we
go
in
as
a
team
all
or
nobody
hans
said
it
may
not
always
be
best
but
those
are
the
rules
exactly
armont
closed
out
the
subject
all
or
nothing
so
let
get
out
the
blueprints
and
start
assigning
the
chapter
sixteen
it
him
alicia
voice
came
back
over
the
intercom
in
the
oval
office
by
now
it
looked
as
disheveled
as
the
situation
room
in
the
basement
what
hansen
said
the
son
of
a
bitch
is
on
the
phone
again
at
this
hour
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
she
asked
just
a
minute
he
clicked
off
the
intercom
and
returned
to
his
other
call
caroline
i
do
know
just
play
it
by
ear
and
do
the
best
you
can
press
secretaries
get
paid
for
giving
tell
the
goddamn
post
we
have
no
comment
try
and
make
a
deal
say
you
give
their
team
an
exclusive
deep
background
just
for
them
if
hold
off
another
few
hours
to
give
us
time
to
sort
this
out
tell
him
we
promise
not
to
give
the
times
anything
fit
to
print
until
after
their
deadline
tomorrow
the
late
edition
he
paused
you
probably
right
but
give
it
a
shot
anyway
look
i
got
to
go
he
reached
over
and
pushed
a
second
button
on
the
console
yes
president
came
the
voice
its
accent
more
pronounced
now
i
know
you
think
you
can
recover
this
facility
with
an
assault
but
i
want
to
assure
you
that
any
such
action
would
be
a
very
costly
mistake
the
only
mistake
that
been
made
so
far
was
made
by
you
going
there
in
the
first
place
hansen
glanced
at
the
listing
of
his
commitments
for
the
next
day
ted
would
have
to
cancel
all
of
them
this
was
how
the
presidency
was
supposed
to
be
nobody
told
him
he
would
be
spending
days
on
end
negotiating
with
a
criminal
threatening
mass
murder
let
me
put
it
like
this
the
voice
went
on
if
there
is
an
assault
all
i
have
to
do
is
retire
to
the
lower
level
of
the
facility
and
then
detonate
one
of
the
nuclear
devices
i
now
have
armed
it
controlled
if
you
want
to
commit
suicide
then
go
ahead
hansen
said
what
kind
of
bluff
was
that
he
wondered
let
me
put
your
mind
at
ease
came
the
voice
as
measured
and
secure
as
it
was
foreboding
my
revolutionary
colleagues
and
i
will
be
at
the
main
power
coil
which
is
buried
at
least
three
hundred
feet
below
the
bedrock
here
it
is
a
bomb
shelter
any
invading
force
however
would
be
vaporized
along
with
all
the
civilians
you
never
escape
hansen
shot
back
what
the
point
that
remains
to
be
seen
but
what
you
have
to
ask
yourself
is
whether
you
are
prepared
to
have
a
nuclear
disaster
in
the
aegean
on
that
point
hansen
admitted
to
himself
the
son
of
a
bitch
had
a
point
the
political
costs
not
to
mention
the
economic
costs
would
be
staggering
look
he
said
you
proposing
a
scenario
neither
of
us
wants
it
would
be
irresponsible
and
immoral
though
i
suppose
those
points
disturb
you
very
much
let
me
help
your
thought
processes
you
have
twenty
minutes
starting
now
if
at
the
end
of
that
time
you
ca
assure
me
that
the
assault
has
been
called
off
please
do
bother
to
deny
that
one
is
imminent
then
what
will
happen
will
be
on
your
hands
he
paused
incidentally
i
also
will
bring
professor
mannheim
to
the
phone
then
and
you
can
explain
to
him
why
he
is
about
to
die
i
am
putting
this
line
on
hold
you
now
have
nineteen
minutes
and
forty
seconds
the
phone
went
silent
hansen
stared
at
ed
briggs
sitting
across
on
the
couch
then
returned
his
gaze
to
the
desk
noting
the
time
on
the
digital
clock
alpha
leader
this
is
seal
one
crackled
the
radio
bearing
range
five
hundred
meters
no
hostile
fire
roger
nichols
replied
continue
inbound
he
clicked
off
his
then
turned
around
and
yelled
to
the
men
in
the
back
of
the
huey
okay
heads
up
the
assault
is
now
in
progress
we
go
in
at
hours
the
deltas
nodded
as
they
checked
their
watches
and
spare
ammo
clips
the
men
were
all
wearing
black
pullover
hoods
each
with
a
thin
plastic
microphone
that
looked
like
a
phone
operator
over
these
they
had
kevlar
helmets
with
protective
goggles
and
light
balaclavas
while
their
bulletproof
assault
vests
included
pockets
filled
with
grenades
and
extra
ammo
for
their
h
k
assault
submachine
guns
nichols
was
using
a
squad
of
ten
navy
seals
to
stage
a
diversionary
assault
on
the
shoreline
the
same
kind
of
diversion
that
had
been
employed
so
successfully
by
the
seals
in
the
war
to
liberate
kuwait
after
leaving
the
carrier
they
would
approach
the
island
at
forty
mph
in
a
pair
of
speedboats
powered
by
mercruiser
engines
about
one
kilometer
offshore
they
were
scheduled
to
disembark
into
two
motorized
zodiac
rubber
raiding
craft
that
they
had
lashed
to
the
bow
if
all
went
according
to
plan
they
would
hit
the
coastline
in
full
view
and
provide
diversionary
fire
giving
the
real
assault
team
an
opening
to
take
the
two
main
objectives
that
when
the
serious
action
would
begin
nichols
and
his
men
would
then
come
in
using
army
choppers
two
huey
gunships
and
two
apaches
the
hueys
would
hover
and
drop
off
the
insertion
teams
while
the
apaches
would
provide
backup
firepower
that
with
their
chain
guns
hellfire
missiles
and
rocket
pods
could
easily
be
mistaken
for
the
end
of
the
world
the
assault
was
timed
down
to
the
second
three
minutes
after
the
diversionary
seal
action
began
the
two
hueys
would
set
down
in
the
middle
of
the
island
and
pour
out
the
real
assault
teams
one
team
to
storm
command
and
the
other
to
hit
launch
control
massively
he
figured
if
they
took
both
at
once
there
would
be
no
place
for
the
terrorists
to
hide
that
was
the
best
way
they
knew
to
accomplish
their
first
objective
which
was
to
neutralize
any
nuclear
devices
safely
the
outstanding
unknown
of
course
was
the
location
of
those
devices
and
their
state
of
readiness
you
had
to
assume
terrorists
were
suicidal
nichols
told
himself
but
yet
what
about
beirut
and
the
marine
barracks
demolished
by
a
suicide
mission
such
things
were
never
outside
the
realm
of
possibility
so
if
these
crazy
fuckers
decided
to
go
out
in
a
blaze
of
glory
it
would
exactly
be
a
first
alpha
leader
the
radio
came
alive
again
seal
one
objective
secure
no
sign
of
any
hostiles
down
here
copy
seal
one
shit
nichols
thought
the
bastards
did
go
for
it
they
battening
down
planning
to
make
a
stand
and
why
not
got
hostages
they
think
we
not
going
to
hit
the
place
they
got
another
thing
coming
it
just
going
to
be
bloodier
than
we
had
hoped
if
they
start
using
the
hostages
for
human
shields
request
permission
to
advance
toward
launch
control
came
the
radio
again
if
we
going
to
provide
that
diversion
we
going
to
have
to
go
in
why
not
nichols
thought
we
already
improvising
but
maybe
the
bastards
can
still
be
drawn
out
it
worth
a
try

seal
one
he
said
checking
his
watch
watch
yourself
it
could
be
a
setup
he
knew
the
seals
were
lightly
armed
with
only
a
german
heckler
koch
submachine
gun
each
plus
a
couple
of
specially
equipped
with
grenade
launchers
the
bloop
tube
still
those
boys
could
raise
some
hell
confirmed
copy
we
slip
in
here
for
five
kick
hell
out
of
anything
not
nailed
down
roger
alpha
leader
if
they
show
their
heads
they
gon
na
know
we
in
town
all
right
armont
declared
we
make
the
insert
here
he
tapped
his
finger
on
the
blueprint
we
hit
the
nerve
center
of
launch
with
bangs
and
tear
gas
and
take
it
down
if
we
lucky
ramirez
will
still
be
there
and
that
should
be
the
end
of
it
he
always
controls
an
operation
totally
nobody
else
will
have
any
authority
that
his
style
if
we
handle
it
surgically
there
should
be
any
major
casualties
among
the
friendlies
the
area
around
launch
control
was
still
foggy
illuminated
mainly
by
the
lingering
spotlights
on
two
vehicles
no
technicians
were
in
evidence
since
the
final
stages
of
the
countdown
were
underway
and
nothing
remained
to
be
done
to
the
exterior
of
the
dry
ice
propellant
had
been
installed
and
now
the
action
was
underground
where
the
subterranean
system
the
superconducting
coil
was
being
primed
at
this
point
most
of
the
staffers
were
monitoring
the
computer
checks
of
the
systems
sounds
good
reggie
said
pointing
to
a
spot
on
the
blueprint
position
myself
right
there
where
i
have
a
clear
shot
at
the
main
points
of
ingress
and
egress
now
let
move
it
before
somebody
checks
in
with
the
security
system
and
picks
up
our
penetration
everybody
else
agreed
signifying
it
by
a
review
of
weapons
and
gear
everybody
that
is
except
michael
vance
who
had
been
thinking
and
worrying
about
the
irreversible
step
that
a
frontal
assault
would
represent
what
if
ramirez
had
left
launch
and
gone
back
to
command
the
man
had
a
habit
of
keeping
on
the
move
it
was
an
innate
part
of
his
inner
nature
you
know
he
rubbed
at
his
swollen
face
and
winced
at
the
pain
i
like
to
suggest
a
different
tack
a
sort
of
before
you
approach
what
do
you
mean
armont
asked
distractedly
anxious
to
get
the
assault
under
way
while
there
was
still
a
lingering
cover
of
fog
and
semi
dark
pierre
before
the
team
assault
why
do
you
let
me
test
the
waters
a
bit
see
if
i
ca
be
a
decoy
long
enough
to
make
them
show
their
hand
care
to
explain
exactly
what
you
have
in
mind
armont
asked
always
willing
to
listen
if
skeptically
they
know
i
here
they
do
know
about
the
team
at
least
not
yet
and
more
to
the
point
we
do
know
if
ramirez
is
really
in
there
or
not
but
assuming
he
is
instead
of
storming
the
place
why
not
let
me
first
see
if
i
ca
draw
him
out
at
least
give
us
a
preview
of
his
resources
how
would
anybody
go
about
doing
that
reggie
was
the
sight
on
his
enfield
assault
rifle
still
anxious
to
get
moving
well
vance
went
on
he
wants
me
so
maybe
this
is
not
the
worst
time
to
use
our
heads
instead
of
hardware
why
not
use
bait
michael
armont
interjected
whatever
you
have
in
mind
you
done
enough
already
this
is
your
fight
and
i
ca
in
good
conscience
ask
you
to
do
anything
more
you
just
take
care
of
those
bruises
and
let
us
handle
it
from
here
on
out
tell
you
the
truth
you
look
like
hell
vance
paused
trying
to
get
a
grip
on
his
own
feelings
all
right
maybe
it
just
a
vendetta
on
my
part
unprofessional
but
the
real
truth
is
i
like
the
chance
to
take
him
down
myself
he
realized
he
had
truly
come
to
hate
ramirez
a
killer
without
a
conscience
who
deserved
anything
he
got
besides
there
another
reason
i
think
he
got
an
old
professor
in
there
somewhere
and
i
confess
a
certain
fondness
for
the
man
in
spite
of
all
his
bungling
if
you
rush
the
place
god
only
knows
what
he
liable
to
do
probably
get
himself
killed
i
can
understand
you
might
feel
you
have
a
personal
stake
in
this
reggie
hall
said
finally
but
what
exactly
do
you
think
you
can
do
remember
the
old
saying
shakespeare
or
somebody
a
hero
is
the
bloke
who
died
i
do
plan
to
try
and
get
killed
but
why
not
let
me
take
some
flash
grenades
and
a
gun
go
up
there
by
the
gantry
and
generate
a
little
excitement
if
he
still
there
maybe
i
can
draw
him
out
he
realize
i
got
backup
you
take
it
from
there
i
not
sure
i
like
it
armont
grumbled
slamming
a
clip
into
his
automatic
if
you
ask
me
there
been
too
damned
much
impromptu
strategy
on
this
op
already
on
the
other
hand
michael
has
a
point
hans
interjected
with
germanic
logic
if
we
can
separate
ramirez
from
the
hostages
it
could
prevent
a
lot
of
danger
to
the
friendlies
my
only
worry
is
that
if
it
does
work
then
we
blown
the
element
of
surprise
all
of
a
sudden
we
got
a
firefight
on
our
hands
we
got
a
firefight
anyway
marcel
observed
no
matter
what
happens
so
why
not
i
agree
it
a
gamble
vance
paused
but
the
alternative
could
be
a
genuine
disaster
he
took
an
from
the
bag
of
hardware
they
had
brought
and
checked
the
clip
does
anybody
strenuously
object
i
do
cally
finally
spoke
up
her
anger
at
him
seeming
to
soften
we
probably
have
to
come
and
pick
up
the
pieces
but
you
right
about
isaac
knowing
him
he
liable
to
just
walk
into
a
line
of
fire
out
of
sheer
all
right
vance
looked
around
while
the
fog
is
still
in
i
want
to
go
up
he
was
pointing
why
wait
for
a
vote
nobody
seemed
to
be
strongly
against
it
i
come
in
from
up
there
he
pointed
by
the
base
of
what
left
of
the
gantry
and
try
to
draw
him
out
if
nothing
else
it
be
diversion
if
it
does
work
you
can
still
go
in
all
right
you
win
armont
said
his
eyes
betrayed
his
lingering
misgivings
but
you
making
yourself
a
target
so
do
try
any
heroics
if
ramirez
does
show
his
face
let
us
take
it
from
there
this
is
your
game
willem
voorst
nodded
and
pulled
out
an
extra
vest
already
festooned
with
grenades
he
handed
it
to
vance
who
slipped
it
on
and
secured
it
wincing
silently
from
the
pain
in
his
rib
cage
just
be
bloody
careful
reggie
hall
said
that
and
nothing
more
british
understatement
calypso
andros
had
no
such
reserve
her
hair
plastered
across
her
face
she
reached
up
and
impulsively
kissed
him
on
a
swollen
cheek
then
she
whispered
good
luck
alpha
leader
this
is
seal
one
i
think
we
spotted
some
hostiles
with
a
smile
nichols
clicked
his
radio
to
transmit
he
was
in
the
lead
huey
now
hovering
slightly
more
than
a
kilometer
away
from
the
shoreline
of
andikythera
i
copy
seal

what
your
status
we
ready
to
get
acquainted
are
you
synchronized
roger
nichols
terse
voice
replied
back
i
want
all
hell
to
break
loose
and
any
bad
guys
you
can
pin
down
or
neutralize
will
be
much
appreciated
we
insert
in
ninety
seconds
we
roger
that
alpha

seal

team
on
full
auto
nichols
turned
to
his
pilot
manny
jackson
okay
it
a
go
i
want
us
on
the
ground
in
seconds
vance
moved
quickly
up
the
hill
toward
the
toppled
gantry
already
he
had
a
view
of
the
wide
sloping
window
that
was
the
center
of
launch
control
and
he
could
see
figures
there
though
not
clearly
enough
to
know
if
ramirez
was
one
of
them
maybe
they
were
satcom
staffers
or
no
there
was
ramirez
talking
on
the
phone
and
standing
beside
him
was
the
man
vance
had
come
to
love
isaac
mannheim
the
old
professor
looked
haggard
a
perfectionist
man
who
had
despaired
he
clearly
had
lost
touch
with
time
and
place
then
ramirez
handed
him
the
phone
and
barked
something
at
him
dejectedly
he
took
it
and
started
speaking
damn
any
sniper
could
take
out
ramirez
here
and
now
he
thought
he
was
safe
and
he
had
never
been
more
exposed
but
this
was
not
a
job
for
an
amateur
not
with
mannheim
so
close
okay
he
thought
guess
this
is
going
to
have
to
happen
the
hard
way
he
extracted
a
flash
grenade
from
the
vest
willem
had
given
him
and
got
ready
to
pull
the
pin
johan
he
do
it
isaac
mannheim
was
saying
into
the
handset
that
ramirez
had
thrust
into
his
face
have
two
devices
one
is
on
ready
for
launch
and
the
other
one
is
here
they
say
they
rigged
a
detonator
on
it
he
going
to
use
it
if
you
do
whatever
it
is
he
wants
let
me
talk
to
the
son
of
a
bitch
again
hansen
said
all
right
johan
please
talk
to
him
mannheim
handed
back
the
receiver
his
hand
was
shaking
have
you
made
a
decision
mr
president
ramirez
inquired
yes
goddammit
i
got
an
open
line
to
gournes
you
can
listen
while
i
issue
the
order
to
hold
off
the
assault
for
six
hours
does
that
satisfy
you
it
will
do
for
a
start
ramirez
said
then
we
can
talk
about
the
money
and
he
listened
as
hansen
spoke
tersely
through
the
secure
communications
link
to
mission
control
on
the
kennedy
what
he
did
not
hear
in
hansen
conversation
was
the
incredulity
on
the
other
end
of
the
line
but
the
assault
is
already
under
way
general
max
austin
was
declaring
stunned
they
were
in
communication
with
nichols
and
the
seals
were
about
to
open
fire
on
the
hostiles
just
scrub
the
operation
hansen
barked
that
an
order
that
was
a
wise
decision
ramirez
said
listening
now
about
the
money
check
with
the
bank
in
fifteen
minutes
hansen
said
a
note
of
resignation
in
his
voice
it
will
be
deposited
now
i
want
you
out
of
there
all
hostages
safe
and
those
weapons
disarmed
and
left
you
have
nothing
to
worry
about
ramirez
declared
scarcely
able
to
contain
his
sense
of
triumph
you
have
made
a
decision
for
humanity
just
get
the
hell
gone
and
do
try
my
patience
this
time
it
was
hansen
turn
to
abruptly
break
the
connection
ramirez
was
cradling
the
receiver
savoring
his
triumph
when
a
blinding
flash
erupted
from
the
direction
of
the
fallen
gantry
and
there
in
the
momentary
glare
stood
michael
vance
the
leader
of
the
seals
lieutenant
devon
robbins
spoke
into
his
thin
microphone
can
you
see
them
we
could
use
an
ir
scope
the
seals
had
split
into
two
teams
as
was
their
practice
and
he
was
leading
the
first
hard
to
make
out
much
in
this
fog
came
back
his
point
man
lieutenant
philip
pease
who
was
leading
the
second
team
pease
was
exactly
twenty
meters
away
all
but
invisible
because
of
his
dark
commando
gear
he
was
studying
the
men
up
the
hill
with
a
pair
of
steiner
binoculars
though
they
were
designed
for
low
light
he
still
could
not
see
clearly
but
dressed
in
black
and
they
look
like
they
armed
what
else
can
you
id
they
not
together
exactly
it
almost
as
though
they
deploying
for
something
what
the
hell
are
they
doing
outside
in
the
first
place
does
it
mean
the
fuckers
have
gotten
around
to
taking
over
the
launch
facility
yet
maybe
they
getting
set
up
for
their
next
move
ca
confirm
anything
seal
one
just
too
much
damned
fog
wait
yeah
they
got
assault
rifles
of
some
kind
looks
like
some
shit
that
a
definite
confirm
do
they
look
like
they
setting
up
all
i
can
tell
for
sure
is
they
moving
spreading
out
about
to
go
down
got
to
be
baddies
who
else
could
they
be
all
right
seal
two
our
mission
is
to
create
a
diversion
shake
them
up
and
let
nichols
chopper
teams
handle
the
heavy
lifting
those
apaches
can
make
a
man
give
his
heart
to
jesus
you
got
a
rog
on
that
seal
one
but
if
we
here
to
make
an
impression
i
say
let
give
them
a
big
navy
welcome
time
for
a
close
encounter
we
came
to
play
get
a
flare
blossomed
from
somewhere
up
in
the
vicinity
of
the
vehicles
illuminating
the
fog
into
a
huge
white
cloud
vast
and
mysterious
what
in
hell
yelled
pease
voice
on
the
radio
that
was
farther
up
maybe
it
a
assault
looked
like
it
was
over
to
the
left
can
you
tell
what
happened
must
have
been
a
these
assholes
brought
their
own
boombox
okay
seal
two
we
got
a
mission
first
things
first
for
now
we
just
neutralize
those
bastards
in
black
looks
like
half
our
hostiles
are
outside
and
in
the
clear
on
the
count
of
three
the
seals
all
clicked
off
the
safeties
on
their
and
took
aim
wishing
they
could
see
something
more
than
dark
vague
outlines
in
the
fog
how
the
hell
ramirez
wondered
did
vance
get
on
the
loose
again
moreau
was
supposed
to
have
taken
care
of
him
had
he
screwed
up
too
i
should
have
just
let
wolf
kill
him
in
the
first
place
and
had
done
with
it
this
time
i
just
handle
it
myself
he
checked
his
pockets
making
sure
he
had
extra
clips
for
his
beretta
and
then
he
headed
through
the
door
leading
into
the
open
bay
of
launch
the
satcom
systems
engineers
and
specialists
not
privy
to
the
wide
windows
of
launch
control
had
no
idea
what
had
just
happened
outside
they
were
too
busy
worrying
about
the
fog
making
the
final
checks
of
the
electronics
monitoring
the
countdown
clicking
off
and
all
of
them
had
laid
side
bets
on
whether
the
launch
now
scheduled
for
less
than
an
hour
and
a
half
away
would
be
able
to
proceed
the
wagering
leaned
toward
the
fog
clearing
in
time
ramirez
strode
past
the
bustling
gray
satcom
uniforms
with
a
mindedness
that
characterized
his
every
move
how
the
hell
he
was
wondering
did
michael
vance
get
on
the
island
in
the
first
place
he
was
one
of
the
support
types
for
arm
a
financial
guy
nobody
had
ever
id
him
in
an
assault
it
made
no
sense
that
he
was
here
when
none
of
the
rest
of
the
arm
operatives
were
around
why
vance
who
was
a
nobody
all
the
same
he
had
specialized
in
screwing
up
things
ever
since
the
initial
penetration
he
had
managed
to
wreck
the
hind
destroy
the
gantry
make
a
general
nuisance
of
himself
the
time
had
come
to
put
a
stop
to
the
annoyance
and
then
get
moving
if
the
money
had
been
delivered
as
hansen
had
claimed
then
it
was
time
to
move
on
to
the
next
phase
just
take
care
of
a
few
banking
transactions
then
put
the
egress
plan
into
motion
he
hit
the
lock
control
on
the
door
which
had
long
since
been
defaulted
to
manual
and
strode
out
his
beretta
ready
the
problem
now
was
finding
that
bastard
vance
in
the
fog
but
the
reflected
light
off
the
spots
illuminating
the
vehicles
was
going
to
provide
visibility
besides
the
bastard
was
a
cowboy
took
chances
right
and
left
he
also
did
seem
to
be
a
particularly
competent
marksman
there
he
is
pierre
armont
said
peering
through
the
fog
with
his
tasco
infocus
zoom
binoculars
they
did
not
require
focusing
and
with
a
touch
of
a
lever
he
jacked
up
the
power
from
six
to
twelve
i
want
the
sucker
myself
we
missed
him
in
beirut
but
this
time
up
above
sabri
ramirez
was
gliding
along
the
side
of
the
fallen
gantry
an
automatic
in
his
hand
ramirez
armont
knew
was
famous
for
his
beretta
used
to
such
deadly
effect
over
the
years
it
was
his
trademark
always
employed
for
assassinations
but
now
finally
after
all
the
years
there
was
the
hyena
exposed
and
clear
one
shot
one
shot
would
do
it
he
mine
armont
leveled
his
captured
ramirez
in
the
sight
and
clicked
it
to
full
auto
vance
was
a
genius
he
had
lured
the
hyena
from
his
lair
take
him
out
and
the
whole
op
would
be
over
in
time
for
morning
coffee
ramirez
was
edging
down
the
side
of
the
gantry
the
cold
against
his
back
when
there
was
an
eruption
of
gunfire
down
the
hill
it
was
controlled
professional
fire
that
seemed
to
be
coming
from
two
locations
an
assault
well
fuck
hansen
the
president
had
lied
claiming
he
had
called
it
off
had
he
lied
about
the
money
too
the
fleeting
thought
made
him
seethe
but
one
problem
at
a
time
he
quickly
ducked
behind
the
fallen
gantry
disappearing
into
the
shadows
one
more
phone
call
then
a
check
with
geneva
if
the
money
had
been
transferred
souda
bay
and
the
american
sixth
fleet
were
both
going
to
disappear
in
a
nuclear
cloud
in
fact
they
were
anyway
what
better
way
to
cover
an
egress
what
in
armont
emitted
a
curse
as
all
hell
broke
loose
behind
them
a
fusillade
of
fire
rained
around
from
somewhere
in
the
direction
of
the
shoreline
it
was
almost
like
covering
fire
not
well
directed
and
since
everybody
on
the
arm
team
had
long
made
a
practice
of
minimizing
exposure
at
all
times
he
did
expect
immediate
casualties
but
what
in
hell
had
ramirez
terrorist
team
encircled
them
drawn
them
in
he
felt
like
an
idiot
hostile
fire
he
gave
the
signal
to
get
down
and
take
cover
swinging
his
hand
from
above
his
head
to
shoulder
level
but
that
was
nothing
more
than
redundant
instinct
the
arm
team
was
already
on
the
ground
ready
to
return
fire
if
so
ordered
nobody
however
was
wasting
ammo
on
the
darkness
the
team
had
little
enough
to
spare
and
besides
why
give
away
your
position
and
create
a
target
the
third
consideration
was
that
arm
never
fired
on
an
unknown
they
were
after
all
civilians
and
answerable
an
army
could
wreak
whatever
havoc
it
pleased
and
later
blame
everything
on
the
heat
of
battle
arm
had
to
be
damned
sure
who
it
was
taking
down
by
the
time
armont
yell
died
away
everybody
on
the
team
had
already
found
cover
behind
the
random
outcroppings
of
rocks
everybody
that
is
except
hugo
voorst
who
spun
around
and
stumbled
backward
moaned
then
collapsed
hold
your
fire
goddammit
hold
your
fire
the
seal
leader
lieutenant
devon
robbins
was
pressing
in
his
earpiece
incredulous
at
what
he
was
hearing
around
him
the
team
was
on
the
ground
in
firing
position
keeping
the
terrorists
up
the
hill
pinned
down
next
would
come
the
assault
roger
alpha
leader
i
copy
does
anybody
know
what
going
on
with
this
whole
op
i
copy
he
looked
around
we
just
got
aborted
what
the
fuck
do
you
mean
the
seal
next
to
him
john
mccleary
said
he
was
slamming
another
clip
into
his
the
team
is
extracted
now
robbins
could
scarcely
believe
his
own
words
you
have
got
to
be
fucking
kidding
came
the
radio
voice
of
lieutenant
philip
pease
we
got
the
assholes
a
couple
of
grenades
from
the
blooper
and
then
we
take
them
they
history
hey
i
just
report
the
orders
i
do
give
them
robbins
replied
immediate
egress
that
the
word
who
the
fuck
knows
but
what
about
the
choppers
nichols
is
coming
in
with
the
apaches
goumes
says
they
scrubbed
too
everybody
on
hold
nichols
just
about
ate
the
fucking
radio
he
going
apeshit
well
the
hell
with
gournes
came
a
third
voice
through
a
black
pullover
maybe
we
had
a
failure
the
fuckers
are
pinned
down
let
just
go
ahead
and
take
them
down
the
whole
op
is
blown
now
they
going
to
know
we
coming
in
they
probably
figured
on
it
anyway
robbins
said
clicking
on
the
safety
of
his
but
who
the
hell
cares
we
out
of
here
flint
you
got
the
rear
use
it
i
on
point
let
hit
the
beach
in
five
pass
it
on
he
switched
on
his
radio
listen
up
anybody
not
in
a
zodiac
in
five
mikes
swims
georges
lefarge
had
been
studying
peretz
trying
to
figure
out
what
was
going
on
one
thing
was
sure
the
countdown
was
about
to
switch
into
auto
mode
which
meant
the
priming
of
the
superconducting
coil
would
begin
when
that
happened
the
cyclops
would
be
entering
a
very
delicate
and
dangerous
phase
shutting
it
down
after
auto
mode
commenced
required
the
kind
of
familiarity
with
the
system
he
was
sure
peretz
did
not
have
mess
up
then
and
you
could
literally
burn
out
the
huge
power
storage
ring
buried
deep
in
the
island
core
which
was
why
the
fujitsu
was
deliberately
programmed
to
thwart
any
straightforward
command
to
abort
ironically
the
mechanism
was
designed
not
to
shut
down
the
cyclops
but
rather
to
carry
through
at
this
stage
the
only
way
to
abort
the
launch
sequence
safely
was
to
bleed
off
the
power
using
the
cyclops
main
radar
the
way
they
had
done
early
last
night
to
simply
flip
a
switch
and
turn
everything
off
would
be
to
risk
melting
the
cryogenic
storage
coil
down
under
the
whole
thing
was
as
bizarre
as
it
was
real
by
continuing
the
countdown
until
everything
went
into
auto
mode
peretz
was
creating
a
monster
of
inevitability
he
was
currently
trying
to
explain
this
to
the
israeli
hoping
the
guy
could
conceive
the
gravity
of
what
he
was
about
to
do
you
understand
he
was
pleading
his
voice
plaintive
above
the
clicks
of
switches
and
buzz
of
communications
gear
in
command
you
going
to
risk
hey
kid
chill
out
peretz
did
not
bother
to
look
up
from
his
terminal
a
recorder
next
to
him
was
humming
away
as
voltage
and
amperage
checks
proceeded
but
look
georges
pointed
to
the
screen
of
an
adjacent
workstation
you
got
less
than
three
minutes
left
to
abort
the
after
the
sequence
it
doing
now
is
finished
the
superconducting
coil
starts
final
that
when
everything
switches
to
auto
mode
it
all
automatic
from
then
on
for
a
very
good
reason
hey
that
why
we
here
kid
peretz
was
grinning
his
crazy
grin
is
not
some
fucking
dry
run
this
is
the
big
one
i
got
no
intention
of
shutting
it
down
we
gon
na
launch
dude
dore
peretz
knew
exactly
what
the
critical
points
in
the
countdown
were
he
had
researched
the
cyclops
system
extensively
he
also
knew
that
after
auto
mode
there
would
be
no
altering
the
orbital
abort
and
the
timing
of
the
detonation
once
auto
mode
began
he
was
home
free
he
could
split
the
trajectory
he
had
programmed
with
sort
was
not
for
souda
bay
but
for
low
orbit
one
orbit
the
abort
had
been
preset
the
bomb
was
going
to
be
delivered
right
back
here
on
andikythera
it
was
brilliant
get
the
money
in
place
get
out
and
then
wipe
out
the
island
all
evidence
of
the
operation
including
sabri
ramirez
the
world
would
then
think
that
all
the
terrorists
were
dead
and
they
would
be
all
that
is
except
dore
peretz
in
truth
he
was
thinking
this
was
almost
the
most
fun
he
had
in
years
the
actual
most
fun
had
been
the
memo
he
had
presented
to
sabri
ramirez
concerning
the
new
split
of
the
money
all
along
he
had
thought
the
phrase
had
a
nice
solid
ring
what
point
was
there
in
spreading
the
ransom
all
over
the
place
giving
it
to
a
bunch
of
assholes
which
was
why
dore
peretz
had
two
weeks
earlier
established
an
account
in
the
same
geneva
bank
where
ramirez
was
having
the
money
delivered
the
memo
had
instructed
ramirez
to
advise
the
bank
to
move
half
the
money
into
that
account
as
soon
as
it
arrived
and
when
funds
were
deposited
into
that
account
the
bank
was
instructed
to
move
them
yet
again
well
beyond
the
reach
of
anybody
all
he
needed
now
was
proof
that
ramirez
had
faxed
the
bank
with
the
new
instructions
so
had
he
the
time
had
come
to
check
in
with
the
bastard
and
find
out
then
it
was
over
all
he
would
have
to
do
after
that
was
commandeer
the
chopper
and
get
the
hell
out
the
only
missing
link
was
somebody
to
fly
the
sikorsky
and
the
perfect
choice
for
that
little
task
was
in
the
next
room
a
certain
vietnam
turned
ceo
he
motioned
for
georges
lefarge
okay
everything
set
auto
mode
we
got
exactly
minutes
to
liftoff
is
that
enough
excitement
for
you
lefarge
did
feel
something
of
a
thrill
in
spite
of
his
better
judgment
he
did
know
why
peretz
would
want
to
abort
the
flight
which
he
knew
was
what
sort
had
been
programmed
to
do
but
at
least
was
going
up
and
when
you
worked
on
a
project
like
this
there
was
only
one
real
payoff
when
the
vehicle
left
the
pad
all
the
months
years
of
preparations
led
up
to
that
final
moment
i
want
bates
peretz
declared
pointing
toward
the
closed
office
door
so
go
and
get
him
that
an
order
it
time
he
got
in
on
the
fun
after
all
this
is
his
baby
georges
turned
away
from
his
useless
workstation
still
shaken
by
the
sight
of
auto
mode
clicking
in
and
walked
back
toward
the
door
bates
had
been
locked
in
there
mainly
to
keep
him
quiet
but
now
things
were
starting
to
happen
several
members
of
the
terrorist
group
had
come
in
started
readying
weapons
and
were
acting
nervous
well
georges
thought
maybe
they
worried
the
might
just
get
off
its
ass
and
come
in
do
something
about
this
outrage
the
terrorists
had
plenty
of
heavy
weapons
and
now
they
were
checking
them
out
and
slapping
in
clips
of
ammunition
bill
bates
was
not
going
to
like
what
he
saw
he
opened
the
door
and
motioned
for
bates
to
come
out
he
slowly
rose
from
his
chair
looking
beat
and
haggard
and
came
georges
first
impression
was
that
he
was
missing
a
large
slice
of
his
old
zip
he
looked
like
a
man
near
defeat
exhausted
even
disoriented
how
are
you
feeling
peretz
asked
how
do
you
think
bates
growled
looking
around
at
all
the
assembled
terrorists
now
readying
their
weapons
the
place
was
turning
into
an
armed
camp
just
a
friendly
inquiry
peretz
went
on
flashing
his
empty
grin
we
about
to
start
the
fireworks
up
at
launch
and
i
did
want
you
to
miss
out
on
any
of
it
he
paused
to
check
the
countdown
scrolling
on
the
terminal
in
front
of
him
so
he
continued
turning
back
i
think
it
time
we
three
you
me
and
georges
here
took
a
small
stroll
and
checked
out
how
things
are
going
mind
telling
me
what
in
blazes
you
up
to
bates
demanded
his
voice
was
still
strong
even
though
he
had
lost
much
of
the
spring
in
his
step
if
you
fuckers
have
killed
any
more
of
my
people
i
going
to
see
to
it
personally
that
take
it
easy
man
peretz
interjected
as
long
as
nobody
causes
any
trouble
then
nobody
gets
hurt
he
turned
and
motioned
for
moreau
keep
an
eye
on
this
place
he
swept
his
arm
over
the
sea
of
technicians
and
systems
analysts
everything
right
on
target
with
the
countdown
it
was
an
impromptu
private
joke
a
thing
that
he
found
delightful
moreau
his
reflexes
now
slowing
slightly
from
lack
of
sleep
did
not
get
the
joke
and
he
did
not
like
the
feeling
he
was
getting
dore
peretz
was
a
canny
little
fucker
and
he
suddenly
seemed
in
a
great
hurry
to
get
out
of
command
was
the
up
to
something
it
was
puzzling
and
troubling
he
adjusted
his
blond
ponytail
and
gazed
around
the
room
now
a
cacophony
of
preflight
activity
keeping
everybody
in
line
was
the
least
of
his
problems
these
engineers
were
so
scared
that
if
you
said
jump
they
all
stand
up
and
ask
how
high
no
what
bothered
him
was
not
knowing
what
the
damned
israeli
had
up
his
sleeve
peretz
was
planning
something
probably
intending
to
leave
somebody
to
hold
the
bag
and
it
was
hard
to
figure
out
who
that
somebody
was
you
know
he
said
to
peretz
everybody
has
orders
to
stay
at
their
posts
and
keep
security
in
case
there
an
assault
you
pulling
out
of
here
is
not
part
of
the
plan
hey
i
been
handling
this
thing
so
far
and
the
launch
is
set
now
i
need
to
check
on
the
telemetry
and
data
hookups
at
launch
if
okay
with
you
i
taken
care
of
my
end
so
now
all
you
got
to
do
is
keep
any
of
these
assholes
from
getting
on
the
computer
and
trying
to
screw
things
up
nobody
so
much
as
touches
a
keyboard
got
it
got
it
moreau
nodded
hating
the
little
son
of
a
bitch
even
more
good
he
said
turning
back
to
bates
okay
baby
we
gone
chapter
seventeen
hugo
voorst
was
lying
propped
against
a
rock
his
shoulder
bandaged
with
white
strips
of
gauze
from
the
kit
now
that
the
flow
of
blood
had
been
staunched
marcel
was
injecting
him
with
a
shot
of
morphine
to
quell
the
looming
pain
happily
the
hit
was
clean
just
a
flesh
wound
and
nothing
serious
but
he
would
be
of
no
further
use
on
the
mission
worse
still
he
actually
had
become
a
liability
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
leave
him
where
he
was
with
an
h
k
machine
pistol
for
protection
and
proceed
you
did
like
to
abandon
anybody
but
voorst
for
his
own
part
mainly
felt
sheepish
giddy
though
he
was
the
result
of
mild
shock
his
dutch
stoicism
was
still
holding
up
i
be
all
right
he
was
saying
a
slow
grin
covering
his
face
as
the
narcotic
kicked
in
sorry
to
be
a
party
pooper
you
got
lucky
hans
soothed
checking
the
bandage
one
last
time
you
get
to
take
a
little
time
off
but
you
may
still
have
a
chance
to
give
us
some
backup
if
things
get
hot
armont
had
not
said
anything
leaving
the
kidding
around
to
the
younger
men
they
needed
it
to
keep
up
their
macho
the
hard
truth
was
the
whole
operation
was
rapidly
turning
into
a
disaster
of
the
first
magnitude
everything
possible
had
gone
wrong
and
now
he
had
no
idea
where
vance
was
the
situation
had
gone
red
the
odds
deteriorating
rapidly
ramirez
had
been
lured
out
but
he
had
been
saved
by
the
ex
machina
an
unexpected
but
attack
from
their
rear
what
had
that
been
all
about
then
he
noticed
a
glint
in
the
sky
through
the
early
dawn
and
realized
it
was
a
helo
far
in
the
distance
banking
as
its
pilot
began
turning
back
he
looked
more
carefully
and
counted
four
all
egressing
take
a
look
he
pointed
toward
the
cluster
of
tiny
dots
slowly
diminishing
in
the
dim
sky
looks
like
somebody
showed
up
just
long
enough
to
screw
us
then
aborted
and
now
mike
is
back
in
the
belly
of
the
beast
he
turned
and
peered
at
the
floodlights
now
growing
pale
as
dawn
began
arriving
in
earnest
around
them
the
dull
outlines
of
trees
and
rocks
were
lightening
into
greens
and
grays
with
the
damned
rocket
still
sitting
up
there
ready
to
blast
off
all
right
he
continued
after
a
thoughtful
pause
we
know
where
ramirez
is
but
after
all
the
shooting
around
here
the
idea
of
a
nice
clean
insertion
will
have
to
go
by
the
boards
he
returned
his
gaze
to
launch
control
no
way
in
hell
could
we
take
launch
by
surprise
now
ramirez
has
got
to
know
something
is
brewing
which
means
we
going
to
have
to
do
things
the
way
bad
news
for
the
hostages
if
they
do
know
how
to
get
out
of
the
way
but
we
got
to
deal
with
the
bomb
no
matter
what
there
was
muttering
and
grumbling
arm
men
did
not
fancy
excessive
gunfire
they
had
all
long
passed
that
age
of
youthful
denial
when
men
thought
they
were
invulnerable
they
had
seen
too
much
by
the
way
armont
abruptly
interrupted
everybody
chain
of
thought
what
happened
to
the
woman
who
was
here
andros
was
she
hit
nobody
had
noticed
up
until
that
point
that
she
was
absent
they
quickly
checked
the
rocks
around
the
area
but
she
was
nowhere
to
be
found
forget
about
her
he
finally
decreed
if
she
does
want
to
stay
with
us
then
she
not
our
problem
he
thought
a
minute
maybe
we
should
break
radio
silence
and
see
if
we
can
raise
vance
he
took
a
unit
with
him
i
against
it
willem
voorst
declared
as
a
matter
of
fact
against
doing
anything
if
the
is
planning
to
come
in
here
and
take
down
this
place
then
why
should
we
risk
our
own
ass
let
just
get
in
a
secure
position
and
let
them
do
our
work
for
us
we
never
had
that
kind
of
help
before
it
might
be
refreshing
i
think
michael
can
take
care
of
himself
why
no
we
ca
wait
for
them
whoever
it
was
armont
cut
him
off
i
do
know
what
the
hell
they
were
really
up
to
and
besides
if
that
little
demonstration
we
just
had
was
any
indication
their
mode
is
going
to
be
to
shoot
first
and
ask
questions
later
so
we
have
to
finish
our
job
just
get
it
over
with
and
i
tell
you
what
i
think
since
launch
is
a
now
our
best
bet
is
to
keep
ramirez
off
guard
for
a
while
and
go
ahead
and
take
down
command
immediately
before
they
realize
what
going
on
with
any
luck
maybe
they
wo
be
expecting
it
he
looked
around
make
a
entry
and
tear
gas
just
blow
out
the
place
he
paused
to
let
the
words
sink
well
he
continued
finally
does
anybody
disagree
there
were
nervous
frowns
but
nobody
did
instead
they
began
silently
collecting
their
gear
hansen
had
returned
to
the
basement
situation
room
where
maps
and
operation
plans
cluttered
the
teakwood
table
and
littered
meal
trays
grease
encrusting
on
the
white
china
were
piled
up
in
the
corner
no
stewards
were
allowed
in
the
room
and
nobody
else
was
going
to
clean
up
he
had
not
slept
for
a
day
and
a
half
and
he
was
now
showing
a
ragged
shadow
of
beard
ted
brock
had
heard
some
of
his
aides
upstairs
commenting
to
each
other
that
he
had
never
seemed
older
all
right
he
said
i
called
off
the
assault
and
given
the
bastard
six
hours
to
clear
out
i
also
released
the
money
had
it
wired
to
the
account
he
wanted
so
maybe
now
he
leave
quietly
our
deal
is
that
he
frees
the
hostages
unharmed
disarms
the
bombs
and
gets
the
hell
out
of
there
but
i
tell
you
something
else
he
not
going
to
live
to
spend
a
dime
the
minute
he
airborne
his
ass
is
ours
i
want
him
shot
out
of
the
sky
and
the
hell
with
the
consequences
he
probably
take
some
civilians
along
with
him
briggs
said
hostages
we
could
be
looking
at
some
dicey
press
all
right
then
so
we
wo
shoot
him
down
we
just
force
him
down
the
way
we
handled
that
libyan
passenger
jet
with
terrorists
aboard
there
was
official
flack
for
a
week
or
so
from
the
usual
quarters
but
off
the
record
everybody
was
applauding
when
you
do
the
right
thing
the
world
makes
allowances
for
how
you
manage
it
briggs
remained
skeptical
but
he
kept
his
thoughts
to
himself
he
wanted
to
have
as
little
to
do
with
the
operation
as
possible
sooner
or
later
there
would
be
loss
of
life
he
was
sure
of
it
and
the
chances
were
the
losses
would
be
massive
he
had
no
interest
in
making
the
history
books
as
the
author
of
a
civilian
massacre
terrorists
or
no
terrorists
all
right
president
i
tell
the
deltas
to
keep
their
powder
dry
until
we
play
this
one
out
he
had
already
heard
from
general
max
austin
who
said
nichols
was
fit
to
be
tied
eating
his
cigars
instead
of
smoking
them
who
could
blame
him
to
have
a
micromanaging
an
op
violated
every
known
canon
of
military
strategy
there
might
be
a
more
surefire
recipe
for
disaster
but
it
was
hard
to
conjure
one
offhand
hansen
for
his
own
part
recognized
the
pitfalls
of
giving
the
terrorists
more
time
however
he
hoped
it
would
end
up
being
the
rope
make
that
false
confidence
that
would
hang
them
he
had
wired
the
ransom
money
to
the
numbered
account
at
banco
ambrosiano
as
requested
there
his
intelligence
on
the
ground
was
reporting
the
eight
hundred
million
had
been
split
and
transferred
to
several
other
accounts
then
portions
of
it
had
been
immediately
wired
out
to
a
destination
not
yet
known
though
it
damned
well
would
be
what
he
wondered
was
that
all
about
were
the
terrorists
in
the
process
of
screwing
each
other
it
was
a
possibility
everything
was
a
possibility
but
it
also
was
smart
because
it
made
recovering
the
funds
that
much
more
difficult
they
were
in
effect
laundering
it
even
before
they
had
made
their
getaway
these
characters
whoever
they
were
were
taking
no
chances
load
it
on
now
ramirez
was
saying
we
taking
it
with
us
he
flashed
a
smile
from
behind
his
aviator
shades
you
never
know
when
you
need
a
nuke
abdoullah
could
believe
his
luck
he
had
been
sure
that
number
one
intended
to
try
and
kill
him
but
now
it
turned
out
to
be
the
others
the
ones
he
sent
over
to
command
that
he
planned
to
leave
in
the
lurch
dawn
was
breaking
but
there
still
was
enough
early
fog
to
mask
their
movements
partially
it
was
definitely
time
to
get
the
show
on
the
road
one
of
the
bombs
had
been
installed
on
the
vehicle
and
a
countdown
was
under
way
when
that
bomb
devastated
souda
bay
nobody
was
going
to
be
worrying
about
a
lone
chopper
somewhere
over
the
med
and
with
the
other
weapon
still
in
their
hands
the
whole
operation
was
going
like
clockwork
the
money
was
in
place
he
was
now
rich
and
they
were
packing
to
leave
the
bomb
they
were
now
loading
actually
made
him
think
maybe
he
mused
fleetingly
he
could
just
kill
number
one
and
return
it
it
would
be
the
final
revenge
for
what
the
bastard
did
to
rais
no
that
was
stupid
better
to
just
take
the
money
and
run
lose
the
heroics
in
fact
given
how
things
had
gone
so
far
the
whole
thing
was
almost
too
good
to
be
true
in
fact
that
bothered
him
a
little
more
than
a
little
he
had
seen
too
much
already
to
believe
anything
number
one
said
or
did
he
trusted
dore
peretz
even
less
the
israeli
he
was
sure
had
a
private
agenda
of
his
own
he
always
seemed
to
maybe
he
was
planning
to
divert
the
bomb
and
take
out
tel
aviv
he
was
crazy
enough
but
who
cared
they
were
getting
out
better
still
number
one
had
indicated
he
intended
to
take
the
old
professor
the
jew
with
them
with
him
on
board
number
one
had
declared
there
was
no
danger
that
the
president
would
order
the
chopper
shot
down
the
old
guy
made
a
perfect
passport
but
with
souda
bay
being
incinerated
as
they
made
their
egress
it
hardly
seemed
to
matter
he
grasped
the
lever
on
the
forklift
and
aided
by
shujat
hoisted
the
bomb
through
the
cargo
hatch
guiding
the
edges
of
the
crate
it
weighed
almost
as
much
as
they
did
together
but
by
now
they
were
used
to
managing
it
interestingly
it
still
was
wired
to
its
controlled
detonator
with
the
explosive
charges
intact
he
had
the
momentary
thought
that
it
should
be
disconnected
but
now
there
was
no
time
that
was
something
that
should
be
done
with
extreme
care
maybe
he
would
take
care
of
it
after
takeoff
when
they
were
airborne
be
careful
ramirez
went
on
but
do
waste
time
the
vehicle
is
going
up
and
then
we
going
to
be
out
of
here
in
less
than
an
hour
team
two
cq
came
hans
voice
on
the
he
and
marcel
were
in
the
overhead
ventilation
duct
above
command
which
had
been
depicted
in
great
detail
in
the
blueprints
hugo
voorst
had
been
left
to
fend
for
himself
while
willem
had
split
off
with
dimitri
spiros
forming
team

team
three
cq
willem
reported
next
ingress
looks
like
a
go
he
and
dimitri
were
at
the
rear
exit
which
passed
through
bill
office
they
had
entered
through
the
tunnel
that
connected
office
and
the
living
quarters
the
door
had
been
set
with
and
was
ready
to
blow
copy
team
one
cq
armont
whispered
into
his
own
radio
he
and
reginald
hall
were
now
in
the
outer
lobby
and
just
ahead
of
them
stood
the
doors
that
led
into
command
together
the
teams
formed
a
pronged
attack
that
would
seal
off
all
egress
take
down
anybody
with
anything
in
their
hands
and
watch
out
for
michael
i
do
think
in
there
but
you
never
can
tell
if
he
is
willem
voorst
voice
said
he
know
what
to
do
as
they
waited
reggie
gazed
around
reception
in
disgust
the
deserted
guard
desk
looked
as
though
it
had
been
strafed
by
an
automatic
almost
as
if
the
terrorists
intentionally
were
wreaking
as
much
destruction
as
possible
cheeky
bastards
he
muttered
under
his
breath
why
do
these
terrorist
blokes
always
think
they
got
to
trash
a
place
reggie
armont
whispered
back
these
gentlemen
did
not
attend
eton
you
have
to
learn
to
make
allowances
and
right
now
they
appear
to
be
trying
to
deliver
an
atomic
bomb
into
somebody
backyard
which
would
tend
to
suggest
they
not
model
citizens
one
has
to
expect
a
disheartening
want
of
tidiness
in
such
an
element
he
checked
his
watch
all
right
get
ready
ahead
of
them
the
doors
to
command
were
closed
who
knew
if
they
were
locked
or
even
but
it
did
matter
the
had
already
been
attached
around
the
frame
exploding
it
and
the
other
door
opposite
would
serve
as
a
diversion
drawing
the
first
fire
and
giving
hans
and
marcel
the
moment
they
needed
to
make
their
own
ingress
rappelling
in
under
cover
of
flash
grenades
and
mopping
up
that
was
the
plan
at
any
rate
a
entry
with
flash
grenades
and
tear
gas
it
usually
worked
armont
clicked
on
his
again
and
checked
his
watch
all
teams
alert
assault
begins
in
seconds
starting
now
peering
down
into
the
room
through
the
overhead
grating
hans
felt
his
palms
grow
sweaty
this
was
the
moment
he
always
hated
even
after
all
his
years
with
the
assault
squads
in
he
had
never
gotten
over
this
moment
of
panic
twenty
seconds
he
glanced
up
from
his
watch
then
tested
the
rope
he
and
marcel
would
use
to
rappel
down
into
the
room
finally
he
adjusted
the
hood
of
his
balaclava
one
last
time
in
an
attempt
to
quell
his
nerves
it
never
worked
of
course
and
it
was
working
now
still
he
always
did
it
more
helpful
was
checking
the
clip
on
his
he
had
a
spare
taped
to
the
one
now
loaded
making
it
possible
to
just
flip
them
over
a
third
was
taped
to
his
wrist
it
should
be
enough
ten
seconds
that
was
the
moment
it
always
happened
when
he
felt
his
mouth
go
dry
bone
dry
reggie
who
normally
served
as
standoff
sniper
almost
always
used
an
old
he
had
had
for
fifteen
years
and
kept
honed
to
perfection
nothing
fancy
just
deadly
accuracy
today
however
he
was
keeping
it
in
reserve
since
this
was
close
quarters
at
the
moment
he
was
going
with
his
sentimental
british
favorite
an
enfield
assault
rifle
that
was
the
last
product
of
the
old
enfield
arsenal
its
special
sling
meant
it
could
be
carried
behind
his
back
and
it
was
short
virtually
recoilless
and
a
marvel
to
behold
on
for
his
own
part
armont
had
a
aug
assault
rifle
augmented
with
a
beta
supposedly
only
available
to
government
organizations
he
did
like
to
bother
changing
clips
which
annoyed
him
as
a
waste
of
precious
time
and
the
circular
dual
magazine
gave
him
so
he
claimed
all
the
firepower
he
needed
besides
he
liked
to
say
if
a
hundred
rounds
were
enough
to
take
down
an
objective
then
you
had
planned
it
right
and
deserved
to
be
in
the
shit
he
gave
five
clicks
into
his
which
meant
five
seconds
then
stood
back
as
reggie
got
ready
to
blow
the
looks
like
you
got
it
right
peretz
said
with
a
crooked
smile
he
was
examining
a
fax
whose
letterhead
read
banco
ambrosiano
geneva
ramirez
had
just
passed
it
over
and
the
correct
account
number
was
there
together
with
the
amount
in
dollars
his
piece
of
the
money
his
bigger
piece
had
been
transferred
to
the
separate
account
he
had
specified
by
now
according
to
the
instruction
he
had
left
it
was
already
on
its
way
out
home
free
he
counted
the
zeroes
again
not
quite
believing
it
the
villa
he
had
set
his
heart
on
was
his
he
had
just
acquired
four
hundred
million
dollars
some
worth
that
much
for
godsake
your
generosity
is
touching
he
folded
the
paper
and
slipped
it
into
his
shirt
pocket
he
had
left
ironclad
instructions
at
the
bank
the
minute
the
funds
were
transferred
they
would
be
wired
to
a
bank
in
nassau
bahamas
a
bank
known
only
to
him
that
way
ramirez
would
have
no
chance
to
fiddle
the
money
back
ramirez
said
nothing
merely
smiled
the
fact
was
this
little
israeli
creep
was
an
amateur
five
minutes
after
he
had
wired
the
instructions
he
had
sent
a
second
fax
countermanding
them
that
was
the
last
thing
to
worry
about
more
important
was
that
peretz
had
left
his
post
at
command
and
come
down
here
to
gloat
so
it
was
a
good
thing
he
had
sent
and
jamal
over
there
to
keep
an
eye
on
things
they
also
had
taken
the
last
stasi
peter
maier
with
them
schindler
had
disappeared
presumably
lost
when
the
began
its
aborted
attack
they
had
proved
to
be
useless
a
fact
he
was
going
to
point
out
to
wolf
helling
just
before
he
shot
him
between
the
eyes
this
crude
attempt
at
blackmail
by
peretz
was
perfectly
in
character
had
in
fact
been
telegraphed
from
the
start
which
was
why
all
the
contingency
plans
had
been
necessary
given
peretz
particularly
obnoxious
demand
he
was
tempted
to
move
the
plan
ahead
and
just
shoot
the
son
of
a
bitch
now
unfortunately
though
he
might
still
be
needed
so
the
best
course
for
the
moment
was
just
to
let
him
think
he
had
gotten
away
with
it
besides
it
was
a
trifle
early
to
finish
thinning
the
ranks
all
in
due
time
it
could
have
been
the
sound
of
a
single
explosion
even
though
it
had
taken
place
at
the
two
opposite
entries
to
command
then
as
one
team
one
and
team
three
were
inside
just
behind
the
harmless
explosions
of
flash
grenades
and
charges
of
cs
they
had
blasted
into
the
room
willem
voorst
of
team
three
was
in
first
position
as
he
virtually
pounced
through
the
door
just
blown
away
with
which
now
was
a
curtain
of
smoke
while
he
sprayed
the
ceiling
with
rounds
sweeping
left
to
right
dimitri
spiros
was
in
second
position
automatically
sweeping
right
to
left
get
down
voorst
yelled
in
english
hoping
the
civilians
would
be
quick
staffers
dove
for
the
gray
linoleum
many
yelling
in
pure
terror
in
voorst
experience
a
couple
of
curious
morons
always
wanted
to
stand
up
and
watch
the
action
frequently
a
lethal
form
of
entertainment
this
time
however
everybody
fortuitously
hit
the
floor
on
the
far
right
salim
khan
yelled
and
brought
up
his
uzi
mesmerized
by
the
face
of
voorst
but
the
dutchman
was
already
far
ahead
of
the
game
and
a
single
burst
from
his
dropped
him
taking
away
the
left
side
of
his
face
the
bearded
iranian
pilot
never
realized
what
had
happened
pitching
forward
without
so
much
as
a
final
prayer
one
away
voorst
thought
but
that
was
an
easy
one
an
amateur
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
armont
was
in
first
position
and
hall
was
in
second
both
poised
to
take
down
anybody
who
showed
hostile
intent
together
with
team
three
at
the
back
their
entry
was
like
a
wagnerian
crescendo
that
began
a
piece
of
music
instead
of
ending
it
the
melody
was
still
to
come
armont
squinted
through
the
hood
of
his
balaclava
into
the
billowing
cs
that
was
enveloping
the
room
the
confusion
that
obscured
the
difference
between
friend
and
foe
dismayed
him
arm
had
had
no
photos
of
the
terrorists
to
work
with
no
intelligence
other
than
the
id
of
ramirez
concerning
their
physical
appearance
the
back
of
his
mind
however
was
telling
him
that
they
all
were
dressed
in
black
just
as
the
members
of
the
arm
team
were
so
everybody
with
a
gun
looked
alike
the
difference
boiled
down
to
who
was
shooting
at
whom
reggie
in
position
had
the
best
eyes
of
any
of
them
and
he
had
moved
in
behind
armont
those
eyes
sweeping
the
room
try
not
to
waste
the
bloody
place
he
was
lecturing
himself
show
some
class
with
the
surprise
still
fresh
it
now
was
time
for
team
two
to
appear
completing
the
assault
through
the
smoke
two
black
figures
appeared
out
of
nowhere
rappelling
down
into
the
very
middle
of
the
chaos
first
came
hans
followed
by
marcel
both
holding
the
rope
in
one
hand
an
in
the
other
while
willem
voorst
and
dimitri
spiros
were
still
firing
hoping
to
draw
the
attention
of
the
hostiles
away
from
team
two
hans
rotated
on
his
rope
and
took
measure
of
the
room
he
had
less
than
a
second
to
get
his
bearings
and
to
analyze
the
immediate
threat
from
hostiles
the
peril
to
friendlies
and
the
opportunities
a
quick
window
of
surprise
offered
the
main
thing
was
to
try
to
cut
down
the
most
senior
experienced
hostile
in
the
room
in
the
millisecond
before
his
feet
touched
the
floor
he
saw
what
he
had
hoped
for
a
man
dressed
in
black
with
long
blond
hair
tied
back
in
a
pony
tail
carrying
an
uzi
better
yet
he
recognized
him
jesus
it
was
moreau
interpol
wants
that
bastard
he
told
himself
but
they
want
him
alive
and
there
a
private
bounty
on
his
head
of
five
hundred
thousand
francs
he
found
money
alive
what
the
hell
ramirez
glanced
at
the
tv
monitor
that
was
next
to
the
array
of
instruments
and
video
screens
looking
out
onto
the
launch
pad
peretz
whirled
to
look
as
did
bill
bates
the
scene
was
command
and
the
image
had
grown
fuzzy
as
though
the
room
were
filled
with
smoke
but
there
was
no
mistaking
the
chaos
satcom
staffers
were
on
the
floor
while
flashes
of
light
darted
across
the
screen
as
the
camera
automatically
panned
back
and
forth
jesus
bates
thought
it
looks
like
nam
it
an
assault
who
could
it
be
had
the
decided
to
get
off
its
butt
and
start
protecting
its
citizens
they
damned
well
had
taken
their
time
about
it
now
he
could
see
who
was
doing
the
shooting
and
most
of
it
seemed
to
be
coming
from
pairs
of
men
dressed
in
black
there
were
abruptly
the
screen
went
blank
switching
to
video
noise
the
panning
camera
had
been
drilled
by
somebody
stray
round
through
the
chaos
of
the
flash
grenades
and
the
tear
gas
moreau
had
missed
seeing
hans
and
marcel
rappelling
down
instead
he
paused
for
half
a
second
then
hit
the
floor
and
rolled
ponytail
flying
intending
to
get
as
many
of
the
hostages
as
possible
between
him
and
the
two
members
of
the
assault
team
at
the
front
he
figured
the
firepower
would
come
from
there
the
rear
entry
with
the
two
guys
firing
at
the
ceiling
was
the
diversion
intended
to
throw
everybody
off
he
knew
better
you
never
looked
where
the
other
side
wanted
you
to
that
was
playing
into
their
hands
he
got
off
a
burst
from
his
uzi
leaving
a
line
of
craters
in
the
cinderblock
walls
next
to
the
front
door
wide
and
high
bad
placement
but
the
game
was
over
it
was
just
beginning
now
he
had
repositioned
himself
so
that
a
terrified
cluster
of
satcom
staffers
were
between
him
and
the
front
and
a
line
of
terminals
protected
him
from
the
rear
good
in
the
momentary
pause
he
slammed
a
new
clip
into
the
uzi
these
assholes
are
going
to
shoot
up
the
hostages
he
told
himself
that
was
how
professionals
worked
and
these
guys
wearing
balaclavas
were
professionals
they
were
fast
moving
quickly
and
not
providing
a
real
target
but
now
you
got
the
advantage
just
concentrate
and
take
them
out
one
by
one
you
been
in
tougher
spots
before
dimitri
spiros
approaching
from
the
rear
also
had
seen
him
the
terrorist
who
rolled
behind
a
line
of
workstations
but
spiros
had
not
recognized
him
to
the
greek
he
was
merely
another
hostile
to
be
taken
down
he
switched
his
to
semiauto
and
carefully
took
aim
between
the
terminals
waiting
for
the
creep
to
show
himself
hans
was
not
planning
to
wait
as
his
boots
touched
the
floor
he
took
aim
and
got
off
a
single
round
carefully
wounding
moreau
in
the
right
bicep
the
french
terrorist
spun
around
startled
but
he
sensed
no
pain
instead
he
felt
satisfaction
at
knowing
now
where
the
third
had
been
life
had
just
been
simplified
a
entry
standard
no
problem
all
you
had
to
do
was
keep
your
wits
he
whirled
and
got
off
a
burst
toward
hans
and
marcel
sending
them
diving
to
the
floor
then
returned
his
attention
to
the
pair
at
the
front
but
now
those
two
taken
cover
where
was
jamal
salim
was
dead
the
stupid
iranian
good
riddance
but
where
was
his
brother
why
was
he
helping
as
it
happened
during
the
first
few
seconds
of
the
assault
jamal
khan
had
been
making
his
own
calculations
he
had
been
figuring
an
assault
was
overdue
and
he
had
been
prepared
for
it
for
several
hours
now
he
had
long
since
donned
a
bulletproof
vest
and
he
had
made
sure
he
had
two
uzis
at
hand
both
loaded
together
with
five
spare
clips
the
moment
the
first
flash
grenades
went
off
he
rolled
beneath
a
row
of
workstations
and
shoved
a
handkerchief
over
his
face
ready
for
the
tear
gas
he
was
sure
would
come
next
now
he
was
surrounded
by
a
frightened
cluster
of
satcom
staffers
the
perfect
shield
marcel
had
also
surveyed
the
room
as
he
rappelled
in
and
by
previous
arrangement
he
had
focused
on
the
right
half
whereas
hans
took
the
left
he
had
seen
jamal
roll
and
started
to
cut
him
down
with
a
blast
but
then
he
thought
better
of
it
there
were
too
many
friendlies
to
take
a
chance
on
ricocheting
lead
just
get
into
position
and
do
it
right
pierre
armont
also
had
seen
jamal
duck
out
of
sight
and
he
felt
his
heart
sink
the
element
of
surprise
had
been
used
with
all
the
effect
it
could
and
the
result
had
been
one
terrorist
killed
and
one
wounded
now
they
were
entrenching
bad
very
bad
then
a
man
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
shouted
something
in
german
choking
from
the
cs
stood
up
and
brought
around
an
uzi
that
one
was
stupid
he
had
identified
himself
and
he
was
wide
open
armont
dropped
him
with
a
single
burst
before
he
could
even
get
off
a
round
clearly
an
amateur
terrorist
he
was
standing
in
the
clear
and
armont
rounds
sent
him
into
a
macabre
dance
of
death
hans
watched
with
satisfaction
okay
he
thought
that
two
now
what
about
moreau
it
would
be
nice
to
take
him
alive
help
salvage
something
from
this
damned
expensive
disaster
moreau
however
had
no
intention
of
being
taken
alive
in
fact
he
had
no
intention
of
being
taken
at
all
he
had
rolled
into
the
shelter
of
a
computer
workstation
and
begun
to
spray
the
entrance
indiscriminately
fortunately
the
shots
were
wild
posing
no
threat
to
the
arm
team
or
anybody
else
unless
by
ricochet
by
now
hans
had
taken
cover
behind
the
terminals
situated
in
the
center
of
the
room
this
was
the
movies
with
the
assault
team
standing
tall
and
shooting
from
the
hip
particularly
with
all
the
friendlies
milling
in
the
haze
of
tear
gas
besides
there
were
plenty
of
hostiles
including
the
young
arab
who
had
provided
himself
a
secure
redoubt
behind
a
row
of
workstations
surrounded
by
hostages
he
knew
that
stray
bullets
could
not
be
tolerated
what
to
do
if
moreau
kept
this
up
he
would
have
to
be
taken
down
lethally
and
damn
the
money
a
shame
really
the
scene
was
rapidly
turning
into
a
standoff
the
worst
thing
that
could
happen
but
first
things
first
determined
to
bag
moreau
alive
he
lobbed
another
canister
of
cs
across
the
room
and
into
the
clump
of
people
and
hostages
where
the
frenchman
was
a
later
it
exploded
spraying
its
noxious
powder
across
a
full
quarter
of
the
room
and
as
that
was
happening
he
threw
another
flash
grenade
the
friendlies
would
be
blinded
and
overcome
he
knew
but
the
effects
would
only
last
for
a
few
minutes
and
by
that
time
everybody
could
be
dragged
into
the
open
air
it
was
better
than
being
mowed
down
in
a
hail
of
fire
the
two
grenades
had
the
desired
effect
insofar
as
they
momentarily
disoriented
moreau
and
they
gave
hans
the
opening
he
needed
to
get
in
behind
the
row
of
terminals
against
the
wall
where
the
french
terrorist
crouched
it
was
the
last
best
chance
he
would
have
to
take
the
bastard
alive
moreau
was
on
the
floor
now
gasping
from
the
cs
as
he
tried
to
get
an
angle
on
what
was
happening
he
knew
he
was
going
to
be
rushed
but
he
was
sure
from
which
direction
and
as
hans
moved
in
that
hesitation
proved
to
be
a
profound
primal
mistake
before
he
could
plan
his
next
move
the
german
was
on
him
an
mps
against
his
neck
he
tried
to
bring
up
his
own
uzi
but
by
the
time
he
had
it
halfway
around
hans
had
kicked
it
aside
and
intercepted
the
move
with
a
yelp
of
pain
moreau
twisted
away
trying
to
recover
and
managed
to
slam
his
left
leg
against
hans
knocking
him
off
balance
both
were
now
cursing
loudly
mingling
their
epithets
with
threats
the
battle
would
have
been
even
had
it
not
been
for
the
fact
that
hans
was
wearing
an
encumbering
balaclava
hans
flash
grenade
had
illuminated
the
entire
room
with
its
blinding
explosion
and
now
dimitri
spiros
was
making
an
end
run
along
the
far
wall
just
below
the
huge
projection
tv
screens
trying
to
encircle
jamal
before
he
had
a
chance
to
recover
completely
from
the
glare
across
the
room
reggie
saw
what
was
happening
and
opened
fire
into
the
ceiling
hoping
to
keep
the
iranian
pinned
down
or
at
the
very
least
draw
his
fire
confusion
reigned
willem
voorst
who
was
in
the
center
analyzed
the
situation
with
a
clearer
eye
the
damned
little
arab
was
not
going
to
be
taken
down
easily
spiros
was
heading
into
danger
not
thinking
dimitri
no
little
fucker
spiros
yelled
he
was
already
moving
impossible
to
stop
his
greek
passion
had
superseded
his
better
judgment
for
he
was
not
wearing
his
bulletproof
vest
a
container
of
those
had
been
left
inadvertently
when
the
seaplane
went
down
and
he
was
in
no
position
to
put
himself
in
harm
way
jamal
was
coughing
and
choking
from
the
cs
but
he
had
not
yet
been
totally
immobilized
he
saw
dimitri
a
hooded
figure
in
the
smoke
and
responded
by
instinct
bringing
around
his
uzi
and
getting
off
a
burst
although
spiros
had
seen
it
coming
and
tried
to
duck
and
roll
he
was
not
quick
enough
two
rounds
caught
him
in
the
chest
but
not
before
he
had
gotten
off
a
burst
from
his
one
of
the
slugs
entered
the
center
of
jamal
neck
above
his
bulletproof
vest
and
literally
ripped
his
throat
open
the
muslim
radical
who
had
helped
kill
two
hundred
and
eighteen
defenseless
marines
in
beirut
collapsed
in
a
pool
of
blood
having
exacted
one
last
price
dimitri
spiros
was
down
gravely
wounded
willem
voorst
was
at
his
side
in
an
instant
he
took
one
look
then
rose
and
sent
another
blast
of
automatic
fire
into
the
iranian
jamal
whose
life
blood
was
already
ebbing
rapidly
it
was
an
impulsive
act
of
anger
definitely
out
of
character
for
arm
but
the
vengeance
of
the
moment
seemed
to
call
for
something
jesus
hans
thought
as
he
watched
the
tragedy
unfold
still
grappling
with
moreau
this
is
turning
into
a
disaster
how
did
we
manage
such
a
and
how
many
more
of
the
bastards
are
there
they
like
vermin
who
keep
showing
up
just
when
you
think
you
got
them
all
the
area
around
him
had
become
a
cacophony
of
gasping
coughing
satcom
staffers
many
moaning
in
fear
all
near
shock
but
it
works
both
ways
hans
thought
if
there
are
any
more
terrorists
hiding
among
the
terminals
they
probably
in
the
same
condition
now
though
there
was
no
motion
anywhere
in
the
room
it
looked
to
be
over
clear
marcel
said
the
first
his
voice
garbled
by
the
balaclava
hans
crunched
a
knee
against
moreau
face
and
heard
him
moan
you
little
fucker
he
yelled
in
french
and
slugged
him
as
hard
as
he
could
it
had
the
desired
effect
moreau
body
went
limp
but
hans
wanting
to
take
no
chances
immediately
yanked
his
arms
around
behind
his
back
and
handcuffed
him
clear
he
yelled
still
breathless
clear
called
reggie
but
not
before
looking
around
one
last
time
squinting
through
the
smoke
he
thought
hoped
it
was
true
a
bloody
great
mess
that
what
the
assault
had
been
and
ramirez
was
still
on
the
loose
objective
cq
armont
announced
finally
even
as
he
surveyed
the
scene
with
bitterness
and
horror
dimitri
had
screwed
up
twice
unforgivable
and
now
he
was
on
the
critical
list
hemorrhaging
from
the
two
holes
in
his
chest
barely
conscious
with
blood
seeping
out
of
the
corner
of
his
mouth
while
willem
voorst
was
already
bent
over
him
trying
to
begin
stabilizing
the
crisis
armont
moved
quickly
to
his
side
hang
on
cheri
can
you
hear
me
spiros
nodded
though
whether
it
was
in
answer
to
the
question
no
one
could
tell
do
move
the
blueprints
show
there
an
emergency
medical
facility
here
they
probably
have
a
supply
of
plasma
pull
you
through
this
time
spiros
tried
to
smile
and
raised
his
hand
slightly
but
armont
gently
took
it
and
laid
it
back
on
the
floor
save
your
strength
we
may
need
you
again
before
this
is
over
then
he
rose
up
and
looked
around
the
room
start
clearing
everybody
out
of
here
and
make
sure
there
are
any
more
of
these
fuckers
hiding
among
the
friendlies
was
it
a
clean
job
he
wondered
did
we
hit
any
civilians
there
was
enough
gunfire
to
create
a
real
possibility
that
somebody
got
nicked
or
worse
he
watched
as
hans
began
shouting
orders
for
the
evacuation
the
air
in
the
room
was
starting
to
be
slightly
breathable
again
and
everybody
seemed
able
to
move
three
terrorists
lay
dead
and
a
fourth
wounded
and
handcuffed
all
wore
black
pullovers
maybe
he
thought
just
maybe
we
had
a
little
bit
of
luck
on
our
side
after
all
it
was
about
time
but
who
could
talk
about
luck
with
dimitri
lying
there
on
the
floor
gravely
critical
god
damn
the
whole
operation
it
was
spiros
fault
but
this
was
no
time
to
recriminate
he
looked
like
his
lung
was
punctured
in
fact
that
was
an
optimistic
prognosis
it
could
be
much
worse
well
armont
thought
with
relief
the
satcom
people
seem
okay
chalk
up
one
for
marksmanship
guess
that
why
we
get
paid
so
well
he
looked
up
at
the
large
computer
screen
being
projected
on
the
wall
at
the
end
of
the
room
which
showed
a
countdown
in
progress
scheme
was
still
on
track
though
there
was
still
almost
half
an
time
left
what
now
all
right
he
declared
let
make
up
a
stretcher
and
get
dimitri
down
to
their
medical
room
hans
pulled
a
syringe
from
the
medical
kit
he
always
had
with
him
and
gave
the
greek
a
heavy
shot
of
morphine
in
his
inner
thigh
in
moments
it
had
surged
through
his
system
causing
his
eyes
to
glaze
and
the
moaning
to
stop
willem
checked
the
wound
again
then
took
some
more
gauze
pads
and
continued
working
he
figured
if
spiros
could
be
gotten
on
intravenous
plasma
within
the
next
fifteen
minutes
he
might
survive
willem
voorst
was
finishing
the
construction
of
a
makeshift
stretcher
from
chairs
and
cushions
while
hans
was
checking
over
the
civilians
as
he
ushered
them
out
into
the
hallway
making
sure
none
were
injured
and
too
deeply
in
shock
to
realize
it
he
also
was
running
an
interrogation
who
here
knows
how
to
stop
the
countdown
just
shut
the
damned
thing
off
nobody
offered
up
his
or
her
services
possibly
because
nobody
wanted
to
be
held
responsible
for
causing
a
meltdown
in
the
dollar
storage
coil
there
also
was
a
more
practical
reason
georges
lefarge
was
in
charge
of
the
countdown
a
coughing
nervously
shaking
young
man
finally
volunteered
he
not
here
now
the
israeli
guy
took
him
over
to
launch
he
paused
but
the
fujitsu
is
in
auto
mode
now
we
ca
just
flip
a
switch
at
least
not
without
doing
horrific
damage
to
the
coil
it
has
to
be
discharged
through
the
cyclops
then
can
you
do
that
hans
asked
not
without
cally
or
georges
here
he
replied
decisively
you
screw
it
up
and
you
talking
millions
of
dollars
he
shrugged
no
way
would
i
attempt
it
without
somebody
his
voice
trailed
off
hans
pondered
this
then
shrugged
okay
you
saying
everybody
here
is
scared
to
tinker
with
the
cyclops
so
we
still
have
to
take
down
launch
and
get
to
the
vehicle
he
glanced
back
toward
the
smoky
room
thinking
aloud
but
we
were
going
to
have
to
anyway
to
get
ramirez
once
we
there
maybe
we
can
find
a
way
to
disable
the
vehicle
some
other
way
the
staffer
looked
dubious
i
do
know
how
there
only
one
real
way
to
do
it
by
bleeding
off
the
cyclops
anything
else
would
be
too
dangerous
maybe
hans
armont
was
shouting
interrupting
them
come
and
help
willem
carry
dimitri
through
the
tunnel
do
you
remember
where
the
medical
room
was
from
the
blueprints
i
memorized
everything
he
shouted
back
what
do
you
think
i
get
paid
for
get
on
with
it
maybe
there
be
somebody
there
who
can
help
out
otherwise
you
two
just
became
doctors
i
save
him
willem
declared
trying
to
sound
as
confident
as
he
could
he
knew
as
they
all
did
that
it
would
be
a
long
shot
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
we
still
have
to
get
ramirez
i
aware
of
that
armont
snapped
back
but
first
we
got
to
get
these
people
out
of
here
and
somewhere
safe
then
he
had
a
thought
maybe
you
should
take
them
with
you
over
to
the
bates
motel
we
could
make
that
our
collection
point
for
friendlies
all
right
hans
agreed
partially
but
this
is
no
time
to
split
up
you
better
come
with
us
if
we
run
across
any
more
of
these
assholes
we
need
backup
armont
nodded
realizing
it
made
some
sense
okay
then
get
the
people
hans
looked
down
and
checked
over
moreau
the
frenchman
was
bleeding
too
but
nothing
about
his
wound
appeared
to
be
serious
a
tourniquet
should
hold
him
some
of
them
can
carry
out
our
friend
here
for
a
moment
he
considered
telling
armont
who
their
captive
was
but
then
he
decided
to
do
it
later
moreau
might
be
more
useful
if
he
did
realize
he
had
been
recognized
then
with
armont
on
point
and
leading
the
way
they
headed
through
the
tunnel
that
connected
bill
bates
office
to
the
living
quarters
minutes
later
command
sat
as
empty
as
a
tomb
impotent
and
useless
as
the
countdown
continued
to
scroll
the
fujitsu
working
the
will
of
dore
peretz
chapter
eighteen
hansen
lied
ramirez
was
saying
as
he
took
one
last
glance
at
the
snowy
tv
monitor
which
moments
earlier
had
shown
the
chaos
in
command
the
son
of
a
bitch
lied
he
did
call
off
the
assault
after
all
it
was
just
a
stalling
tactic
he
turned
to
peretz
anger
deep
in
his
eyes
we
been
what
do
you
care
what
happens
to
those
assholes
peretz
remarked
calmly
flashing
his
pale
grin
good
riddance
let
just
take
the
old
guy
like
we
planned
and
get
the
hell
out
of
here
we
got
the
money
so
who
gives
a
shit
you
have
an
inelegant
but
concise
way
of
putting
things
ramirez
concurred
but
there
a
final
phone
call
i
need
to
make
i
want
hansen
to
know
what
will
happen
if
he
tries
to
interdict
us
well
while
you
doing
that
i
check
out
the
chopper
peretz
went
on
when
we
split
i
do
want
any
problems
is
that
why
you
brought
him
ramirez
pointed
at
bates
might
as
well
have
someone
with
some
aviation
experience
look
it
over
peretz
smiled
again
besides
i
think
we
may
have
just
lost
salim
in
all
that
excitement
over
in
command
so
we
going
to
need
a
pilot
right
what
better
than
a
war
hero
william
bates
had
been
monitoring
this
exchange
not
quite
understanding
the
underlying
dynamics
he
did
perceive
however
that
peretz
was
playing
the
scene
as
though
he
were
in
a
game
and
it
looked
like
a
contest
with
only
a
single
winner
number
one
however
was
not
the
kind
of
guy
who
struck
you
as
a
loser
but
then
peretz
did
seem
like
the
losing
type
either
the
israeli
was
one
wily
son
of
a
bitch
and
he
had
something
up
his
sleeve
was
he
intending
to
screw
number
one
somehow
and
get
away
with
all
the
marbles
just
how
he
intended
to
do
that
was
not
yet
clear
but
there
was
no
mistaking
his
faked
attempt
at
calm
if
number
one
did
catch
it
he
was
dumber
than
he
looked
and
he
did
look
dumb
what
he
wondered
had
happened
to
mike
did
the
message
lefarge
had
passed
along
ulysses
has
landed
mean
he
was
on
the
island
somewhere
and
if
he
was
here
had
he
called
in
arm
were
they
the
ones
who
had
just
stormed
command
not
the
whoever
did
it
they
hit
the
wrong
place
the
murdering
bastard
who
called
himself
number
one
was
here
and
he
was
about
to
get
away
vance
wanted
to
kick
himself
he
screwed
up
again
managing
to
blind
himself
with
his
own
flash
grenade
and
having
done
that
he
thought
it
the
better
part
of
discretion
to
take
cover
and
hope
pierre
and
the
team
could
take
out
ramirez
with
a
clear
shot
instead
ramirez
got
away
why
did
they
get
him
instead
they
got
into
some
kind
of
firefight
heck
he
thought
if
i
known
they
were
going
to
blow
it
i
could
have
tried
to
take
him
out
myself
half
blind
or
no
now
though
ramirez
was
back
in
launch
in
the
control
room
worse
still
he
told
himself
i
really
screwed
things
up
i
blew
the
element
of
surprise
now
what
he
sat
down
feeling
like
a
prisoner
of
the
fog
and
began
to
engage
in
extensive
he
was
afraid
to
use
the
radio
and
he
did
know
where
the
arm
team
was
everything
had
to
be
rethought
michael
is
that
you
are
you
all
right
cally
was
a
pale
apparition
in
the
now
working
her
way
around
the
remains
of
the
gantry
i
terrific
thank
goodness
i
almost
gave
up
on
finding
you
what
happened
down
there
he
was
relieved
to
see
her
but
otherwise
he
still
felt
miserable
also
he
wondered
if
she
was
still
angry
we
got
ambushed
by
somebody
from
the
direction
of
the
shoreline
i
did
know
there
were
so
many
of
them
she
looked
back
down
the
hill
puzzled
it
was
strange
there
was
a
lot
of
firing
and
then
it
just
stopped
but
one
of
your
guys
got
hit
who
our
first
casualty
he
thought
the
disaster
grows
i
do
know
his
name
i
think
he
was
dutch
willem
or
hugo
vance
loved
them
both
and
felt
his
heart
turn
i
do
know
but
it
looked
like
he
going
to
be
all
right
i
decided
not
to
stick
around
so
you
do
know
where
they
went
pierre
and
the
team
have
a
clue
vance
sighed
okay
the
way
i
see
it
we
only
got
one
chance
left
but
i
have
to
get
bill
to
help
that
going
to
be
next
to
impossible
they
still
holding
him
in
command
not
any
more
i
think
i
saw
him
through
the
window
there
a
couple
of
minutes
ago
he
pointed
there
in
launch
that
not
a
good
sign
she
sighed
it
could
mean
they
may
be
getting
ready
to
leave
and
they
probably
going
to
take
him
with
them
then
we
got
to
break
protocol
get
on
the
radio
and
try
to
locate
pierre
look
you
bastard
the
president
was
saying
into
the
phone
done
everything
you
asked
i
deposited
the
money
and
pulled
back
all
american
forces
for
six
hours
now
you
going
to
live
up
to
your
end
of
the
agreement
you
going
to
disarm
those
weapons
and
get
the
hell
out
of
there
no
hostages
i
personally
guarantee
you
safe
passage
if
he
believe
that
hansen
was
thinking
he
still
writing
letters
to
santa
who
do
you
think
you
talking
to
ramirez
asked
there
a
force
on
the
island
right
now
that
got
my
people
under
fire
i
no
longer
can
take
responsibility
for
anything
that
happens
i
do
know
what
you
talking
about
hansen
replied
genuinely
puzzled
had
the
deltas
countermanded
his
orders
carried
out
a
rogue
operation
if
so
there
was
going
to
be
hell
to
pay
if
somebody
there
they
not
part
of
the
american
armed
forces
your
problem
not
mine
it
is
your
problem
i
want
you
to
put
a
stop
to
it
how
the
hell
am
i
supposed
to
do
that
exactly
what
can
he
be
talking
about
hansen
was
still
wondering
if
you
ca
handle
your
situation
then
maybe
you
better
go
back
to
terrorist
school
kept
up
my
end
ramirez
proceeded
to
tell
the
president
two
things
first
when
the
sikorsky
took
off
from
the
landing
pad
isaac
mannheim
was
going
to
be
on
board
a
hostage
he
was
their
insurance
that
much
was
true
the
second
was
a
lie
the
other
thing
you
should
know
is
that
we
have
armed
a
nuclear
device
and
secured
it
on
the
island
the
detonation
sequence
is
controlled
if
there
is
any
interference
with
our
egress
no
matter
at
what
point
we
will
not
hesitate
to
detonate
it
you
do
that
hansen
said
and
you
be
tracked
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
that
something
i
can
guarantee
you
for
absolute
certain
he
had
visions
of
his
presidency
going
down
in
ruins
and
if
the
story
of
the
money
ever
came
out
the
headlines
then
you
also
have
the
power
to
guarantee
that
it
does
happen
think
about
it
with
which
cryptic
farewell
the
connection
was
severed
for
the
last
time
the
fact
that
a
nuclear
bomb
was
about
to
obliterate
souda
bay
crete
and
the
sixth
fleet
in
a
matter
of
minutes
was
not
mentioned
ulysses
to
sirene
do
you
read
me
when
his
radio
crackled
armont
was
in
the
medical
facility
of
the
bates
motel
watching
as
a
plasma
iv
was
attached
to
dimitri
arm
he
immediately
grabbed
for
it
i
copy
mike
but
make
this
quick
are
you
all
right
never
better
where
are
you
guys
sorry
to
break
radio
silence
but
i
think
ramirez
may
be
getting
ready
to
pull
out
could
be
now
or
never
we
took
down
command
armont
said
into
his
talkie
neutralized
four
of
the
bastards
and
cleared
it
looks
to
be
a
clean
job
as
far
as
the
friendlies
are
concerned
a
minor
miracle
considering
and
when
we
got
here
to
the
motel
there
was
a
greek
one
of
them
but
we
took
care
of
him
nice
work
the
good
news
they
all
here
with
us
now
and
they
seem
okay
he
leaned
out
and
took
a
peek
down
the
hall
the
satcom
systems
engineers
were
all
collapsed
on
the
floor
drinking
cokes
from
the
machine
at
the
end
there
bad
news
too
in
the
first
place
nobody
there
would
shut
off
the
countdown
they
just
afraid
to
do
it
has
to
do
with
melting
some
kind
of
coil
the
bird
is
still
going
up
what
the
second
place
the
other
bad
news
dimitri
got
shot
up
he
in
pretty
bad
shape
we
in
the
emergency
room
now
just
keeping
him
alive
we
got
to
evacuate
him
out
of
here
and
soon
i
hear
you
vance
replied
back
but
the
only
way
i
know
of
right
now
is
with
one
of
the
helos
either
the
agusta
or
their
sikorsky
how
long
can
he
hold
on
we
still
need
to
take
out
ramirez
i
have
given
up
michael
the
airspace
is
closed
around
the
island
totally
shut
down
i
guarantee
it
there
no
way
he
could
get
a
chopper
out
trapped
going
nowhere
we
staying
with
dimitri
till
we
sure
stabilized
and
then
we
come
down
there
and
handle
that
son
of
a
bitch
all
in
time
all
right
vance
said
take
care
of
dimitri
in
the
meantime
let
me
see
what
i
can
do
at
this
end
and
while
you
there
you
might
want
to
sweep
that
place
for
explosives
i
think
they
were
planning
to
get
everybody
inside
and
blow
it
i
found
some
on
a
timer
down
on
the
second
level
by
the
elevator
there
may
also
be
some
more
of
them
hanging
around
there
so
be
careful
only
way
we
know
major
general
eric
nichols
was
in
the
kennedy
mission
control
room
fit
to
be
tied
now
he
was
beginning
to
understand
how
the
attempted
rescue
of
the
american
embassy
hostages
in
tehran
could
have
turned
into
such
a
disaster
he
lit
a
cigar
and
tried
to
relax
the
op
would
be
back
on
track
in
he
checked
his
watch
another
five
and
a
half
hours
unless
of
course
the
orders
got
changed
again
then
the
blue
phone
on
his
desk
rang
well
i
be
damned
he
said
hanging
up
a
few
moments
later
i
knew
this
was
going
to
be
a
but
i
think
we
just
expanded
the
term
he
looked
over
the
deltas
waiting
with
him
would
you
believe
it
back
on
something
happened
who
knows
what
but
the
sons
of
bitches
are
pulling
out
and
they
threatened
to
nuke
the
place
if
anybody
tries
to
stop
them
we
ordered
to
get
in
there
before
anybody
can
get
off
the
ground
keep
them
from
having
the
chance
i
do
know
if
we
going
to
make
it
he
grinned
but
tell
you
one
thing
this
time
we
going
to
just
take
the
place
down
once
and
for
all
and
the
hell
with
micromanaging
from
fort
or
anywhere
fuckin
a
lieutenant
manny
jackson
declared
reaching
for
his
flight
jacket
i
say
we
just
do
a
standoff
with
hellfire
missiles
take
out
their
damned
space
vehicles
and
any
choppers
they
got
then
they
can
just
stick
their
nukes
up
their
ass
sorry
jackson
but
that
still
our
last
resort
if
we
hit
the
vehicles
there
the
risk
of
nuclear
material
getting
loose
no
what
we
going
to
do
is
take
down
their
radar
power
source
the
cyclops
and
any
choppers
they
have
which
ought
to
put
them
out
of
business
and
if
that
does
cause
the
bastards
to
throw
in
the
towel
then
we
call
in
a
tomcat
and
lay
a
couple
of
missiles
right
into
those
underground
bunkers
nichols
had
studied
the
satellite
photo
intelligence
they
had
as
well
as
site
plans
and
blueprints
obtained
from
satcom
executive
offices
in
arlington
and
he
knew
exactly
where
a
missile
would
have
the
best
chance
of
penetrating
command
and
launch
control
there
might
be
some
civilian
casualties
but
they
sure
as
hell
would
have
the
nukes
in
there
a
quick
decisive
operation
all
right
he
added
in
conclusion
let
rock
and
roll
and
this
time
there
going
to
be
no
recall
i
do
care
who
tries
how
does
it
look
peretz
was
asking
he
and
bill
bates
had
just
climbed
aboard
the
sikorsky
cold
and
gray
in
the
light
fog
bates
had
already
checked
it
over
from
the
outside
it
was
military
and
it
appeared
to
be
on
loan
from
the
pakistani
air
force
with
the
markings
clumsily
painted
over
but
it
appeared
to
be
in
pristine
shape
good
maintenance
let
me
see
he
walked
to
the
cockpit
and
looked
over
the
rows
of
instruments
nothing
obvious
seemed
amiss
if
there
fuel
it
should
be
able
to
fly
after
all
it
got
in
here
from
somewhere
peretz
nodded
with
satisfaction
then
clicked
on
his
firebird
one
bates
says
there
may
be
some
problems
with
the
nav
gear
he
wants
to
start
it
up
and
give
it
an
instrument
check
probably
just
feeding
me
some
kind
of
bullshit
so
why
do
you
send
out
helling
for
a
minute
he
should
be
in
on
this
what
bates
mumbled
i
did
i
copy
you
came
back
ramirez
voice
what
seems
to
be
the
problem
probably
no
big
deal
claims
it
the
computer
something
to
do
with
flight
control
all
right
ramirez
replied
i
send
wolf
out
if
you
think
you
need
him
the
clicked
off
to
the
accompaniment
of
static
what
are
you
talking
about
bates
looked
up
feeling
a
chill
i
do
see
anything
here
that
looks
like
a
problem
who
the
hell
knows
if
the
computer
is
just
shut
up
peretz
barked
now
start
the
engines
but
just
do
what
i
tell
you
he
was
now
grasping
a
walther
with
what
appeared
to
be
boundless
you
the
boss
bates
nodded
settling
into
the
cockpit
he
suddenly
realized
that
something
not
on
the
schedule
was
about
to
go
down
all
along
he
had
a
feeling
peretz
was
up
to
something
now
it
was
more
than
a
feeling
with
a
tremble
of
apprehension
he
hit
the
ignition
button
then
started
spooling
up
the
power
on
the
main
rotor
everything
seemed
to
be
working
normally
just
as
it
should
this
old
crate
he
figured
had
a
lot
of
hours
on
the
engines
but
there
was
nothing
to
suggest
any
kind
of
problem
coming
toward
them
now
across
the
tarmac
was
the
famous
german
terrorist
wolf
helling
bates
glanced
through
the
windscreen
and
looked
him
over
thinking
he
looked
annoyed
he
had
the
hard
face
and
eyes
of
a
killer
the
kind
of
face
you
could
only
earn
the
hard
way
suddenly
the
whole
scenario
clicked
into
place
this
israeli
character
was
about
to
try
and
pull
a
fast
one
on
everybody
he
had
set
the
vehicle
to
launch
and
now
he
was
getting
out
but
what
about
the
german
was
he
in
on
the
scam
probably
not
from
the
disgruntled
look
he
had
besides
this
guy
peretz
was
the
quintessential
loner
he
had
his
marbles
and
the
hell
with
everybody
else
what
the
problem
helling
asked
as
he
stepped
lightly
up
the
metal
steps
of
the
sikorsky
is
something
he
never
had
a
chance
to
finish
the
sentence
as
a
dull
thunk
punctuated
the
placement
of
a
round
directly
between
his
eyes
the
leader
of
germany
notorious
revolutionare
zellen
pitched
into
the
chopper
dead
before
he
reached
the
floor
pallet
fucking
nazi
peretz
said
to
no
one
in
particular
i
been
waiting
a
long
time
then
he
stepped
over
the
body
and
headed
for
the
cockpit
okay
it
about
to
be
post
time
baby
you
going
to
bug
out
are
you
bates
had
turned
around
and
was
staring
at
him
you
son
of
a
bitch
you
got
set
to
launch
and
now
you
leaving
while
the
leaving
good
it
not
going
to
be
that
simple
he
responded
calmly
but
we
are
about
to
make
an
unscheduled
departure
you
will
be
flying
and
get
shot
down
bates
said
rising
and
walking
back
from
the
cockpit
come
on
this
place
has
got
to
be
surrounded
he
had
hoped
now
feared
it
was
so
surely
the
word
on
these
terrorists
was
all
over
the
world
by
now
you
have
got
to
be
kidding
no
way
am
i
taking
this
bird
up
you
on
your
own
pal
i
refuse
that
would
be
a
serious
mistake
peretz
smiled
back
because
if
you
give
me
the
slightest
hint
of
trouble
you
going
to
enjoy
the
same
fate
as
this
nazi
klutz
starting
with
your
kneecaps
i
would
advise
you
to
be
cooperative
he
smiled
again
do
what
you
want
bates
said
not
quite
feeling
his
own
bravado
but
you
be
flying
it
yourself
do
press
me
asshole
peretz
said
besides
there
a
nuclear
weapon
in
that
crate
there
he
pointed
nobody
going
to
lay
a
finger
on
us
do
you
know
how
to
handle
this
vance
handed
cally
the
he
was
carrying
he
had
brought
it
up
the
hill
to
try
to
take
out
ramirez
but
after
the
fiasco
with
the
flash
grenades
he
had
fired
a
shot
i
got
a
pretty
good
idea
she
replied
some
of
the
old
pique
coming
back
somebody
better
use
it
besides
it
does
exactly
require
postgraduate
research
sometimes
it
takes
some
thought
to
keep
from
getting
killed
he
sighed
then
proceeded
to
show
her
how
the
safety
worked
okay
what
i
need
is
for
you
to
give
me
some
cover
when
i
make
the
move
call
it
our
effort
what
are
you
going
to
do
what
else
it
time
i
had
a
talk
with
ramirez
if
you
ca
lick
them
join
them
you
kidding
she
laid
down
the
automatic
and
glared
you
going
to
just
give
up
no
i
going
to
offer
him
a
deal
maybe
it
work
and
maybe
not
but
i
do
know
what
else
to
do
she
stared
at
him
incredulously
what
kind
of
deal
i
do
know
yet
i
making
this
up
as
i
go
along
but
maybe
if
i
can
get
in
close
to
him
i
can
try
to
slow
him
down
what
would
happen
he
was
wondering
if
ramirez
saw
him
again
just
shoot
him
on
sight
it
was
possible
but
then
again
maybe
not
it
was
worth
a
try
but
got
to
help
create
a
diversion
that
give
me
an
opening
all
right
then
she
shrugged
just
tell
me
what
you
want
me
to
do
now
he
was
fiddling
with
his
walther
checking
how
many
rounds
were
left
in
the
clip
there
were
two
he
cocked
it
then
slipped
it
into
the
back
of
his
belt
pulling
down
the
shirt
over
it
see
that
window
there
he
was
pointing
toward
the
viewing
station
of
launch
control
that
overlooked
the
pad
and
the
vehicles
i
want
to
get
him
there
where
you
can
see
us
both
then
when
i
give
a
signal
a
i
want
you
to
open
fire
on
you
both
she
looked
incredulous
how
about
trying
very
hard
not
to
hit
either
one
of
us
just
start
firing
and
distract
them
then
i
try
to
take
care
of
ramirez
somehow
you
know
i
do
know
why
you
doing
this
but
it
seems
awfully
dangerous
maybe
i
trying
to
make
amends
for
being
such
a
he
was
half
serious
that
very
noble
but
frankly
i
think
we
better
wait
for
your
friends
from
arm
she
picked
up
the
automatic
and
examined
it
again
then
looked
him
over
be
brutally
honest
they
got
a
slightly
better
track
record
good
point
except
now
they
got
a
casualty
to
worry
about
and
we
running
out
of
time
so
this
has
to
be
solo
he
kissed
her
this
time
on
the
lips
wish
me
luck
you
really
going
to
do
it
are
you
i
going
to
try
he
finished
tucking
in
his
shirt
you
crazy
you
wo
listen
to
anybody
sometimes
that
a
help
he
kissed
her
again
more
lightly
than
he
wanted
to
was
she
still
mad
it
was
hard
to
tell
but
she
was
definitely
distant
okay
get
ready
and
for
god
sake
do
hit
me
fire
wide
wide
she
grinned
extremely
wide
thought
you
might
be
getting
lonesome
vance
had
walked
into
launch
control
directly
through
the
entrance
next
to
where
the
fallen
gantry
had
been
ramirez
had
met
him
with
his
beretta
trained
on
him
from
the
instant
he
came
in
the
doorway
always
the
joker
mr
vance
ramirez
did
not
appear
to
think
he
was
very
humorous
i
see
you
roaming
around
again
like
a
cat
nine
lives
remember
yes
i
should
have
put
an
end
to
them
earlier
he
gestured
vance
forward
with
the
automatic
they
now
were
in
launch
control
the
wide
windows
looking
out
over
the
vehicles
but
then
i
wanted
you
to
myself
here
i
am
he
felt
a
chill
was
ramirez
just
going
to
shoot
him
before
he
had
a
chance
to
do
anything
the
terrorist
however
seemed
to
have
other
things
on
his
mind
you
know
you
been
missing
out
on
a
lot
of
the
fun
there
was
something
of
a
ruckus
in
command
just
now
as
it
happens
it
was
on
that
tv
there
he
pointed
to
a
monitor
its
screen
now
filled
with
snow
a
decidedly
entertainment
but
i
watched
awhile
anyway
sounds
exciting
want
to
tell
me
what
happened
the
broadcast
encountered
technical
difficulties
before
the
end
for
all
i
know
the
show
may
still
be
going
on
but
perhaps
i
should
break
some
news
to
you
that
assault
force
whoever
they
were
merely
saved
me
the
trouble
of
tidying
up
myself
you
were
planning
just
to
murder
all
your
helpers
anyway
right
he
settled
into
a
sculptured
chair
next
to
a
console
as
casually
as
he
could
manage
neatness
guess
i
should
have
thought
of
that
you
should
have
thought
of
a
lot
of
things
mr
vance
and
how
about
you
did
the
ransom
money
come
through
i
assume
this
operation
had
a
price
tag
attached
he
laughed
of
course
the
money
came
through
all
eight
hundred
million
what
do
you
take
me
for
respectable
chunk
of
change
so
why
in
hell
are
you
going
to
still
launch
an
even
vance
was
impressed
by
his
perfidy
that
not
very
sporting
i
not
a
sporting
person
that
hardly
a
news
flash
he
felt
his
outrage
spilling
over
mind
telling
me
the
target
not
at
all
i
going
to
incinerate
the
air
and
naval
base
at
souda
bay
the
americans
do
care
anything
about
civilians
as
they
have
shown
any
number
of
times
but
they
are
very
attached
to
their
sixth
fleet
jesus
you
totally
mad
it
was
worse
than
he
had
imagined
going
to
kill
hundreds
thousands
how
in
hell
can
you
do
that
easily
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
as
good
as
done
in
a
few
minutes
he
checked
his
watch
then
glanced
up
and
examined
vance
a
moment
it
looks
like
did
a
fairly
good
job
i
should
have
told
him
to
just
finish
it
he
got
close
enough
believe
me
looking
at
you
i
have
to
agree
he
smiled
eyes
behind
his
gray
shades
all
right
vance
i
assume
you
came
back
in
here
for
a
reason
what
is
it
the
truth
is
i
dropping
by
to
see
if
we
could
talk
over
a
deal
i
do
really
think
so
you
may
be
able
to
set
off
a
bomb
but
the
way
things
stand
no
way
are
you
going
to
get
out
of
here
in
one
piece
he
was
trying
out
the
speech
he
had
been
rehearsing
in
case
you
did
realize
it
the
navy
has
the
airspace
around
the
island
totally
closed
down
the
skies
over
the
eastern
med
are
currently
an
parking
lot
but
if
put
a
stop
to
all
this
insanity
release
the
hostages
then
do
try
to
bluff
me
mr
vance
he
gestured
him
forward
come
take
a
look
at
my
collateral
he
led
the
way
across
to
a
second
row
of
workstations
these
on
the
side
and
closer
to
the
window
when
i
leave
which
is
imminent
i
will
have
company
a
certain
professor
i
think
you
met
him
and
sure
enough
there
in
the
comer
sat
isaac
mannheim
looking
as
though
the
world
had
already
ended
the
old
man
appeared
to
be
in
a
dark
space
of
his
very
own
his
face
pitifully
sunk
in
his
hands
it
ca
be
stopped
he
was
mumbling
almost
incoherently
damn
them
there
should
be
a
special
rung
in
hell
for
them
do
worry
vance
assured
him
there
is
he
turned
back
to
ramirez
it
is
going
to
work
the
is
not
going
to
be
bluffed
he
hoped
it
was
true
somehow
though
he
did
feel
all
that
confident
ramirez
was
smart
very
smart
and
the
had
a
history
of
screwing
these
things
up
just
outside
the
window
awaited
primed
and
about
to
lift
off
unlike
the
space
shuttle
it
had
no
clouds
of
white
condensate
spewing
out
instead
it
stood
serene
and
austere
its
payload
prepared
to
wreak
havoc
on
thousands
of
unsuspecting
citizens
the
loss
of
life
would
be
staggering
he
got
johan
to
call
off
the
assault
mannheim
continued
interrupting
his
thoughts
it
was
because
of
me
he
wanted
to
save
me
he
did
but
he
only
made
things
worse
he
should
have
just
let
them
kill
me
and
have
done
with
it
vance
examined
him
and
stifled
a
sigh
now
he
had
mannheim
to
worry
about
he
did
want
cally
to
start
shooting
up
the
place
with
him
in
the
room
so
he
could
go
to
the
window
and
signal
her
the
way
he
had
planned
what
to
do
look
he
said
finally
turning
to
ramirez
if
you
need
insurance
why
not
just
take
me
and
let
mannheim
go
you
and
i
have
some
unfinished
business
he
not
part
of
it
he
will
go
all
right
with
me
on
the
helicopter
you
on
the
other
hand
are
ramirez
glanced
out
the
wide
window
and
fell
silent
as
he
studied
the
sikorsky
the
main
rotor
was
starting
to
power
up
and
something
about
that
seemed
not
to
sit
well
with
him
suddenly
he
seemed
galvanized
he
glanced
at
his
watch
then
checked
the
safety
on
his
beretta
vance
watched
this
wondering
what
to
do
was
this
the
golden
moment
to
try
and
take
him
there
were
only
the
pakis
outside
to
worry
about
but
ramirez
was
already
moving
grabbing
mannheim
by
the
arm
abruptly
he
stopped
turned
and
took
aim
at
vance
somewhere
precisely
between
his
eyes
vance
blanched
jesus
go
for
the
walther
and
get
it
over
with
but
before
he
could
move
ramirez
laughed
and
slipped
the
hand
holding
the
beretta
into
his
pocket
then
gave
a
nod
of
his
head
beckoning
vance
i
think
i
would
like
to
have
you
join
us
after
all
right
we
still
have
a
few
matters
to
settle
he
stepped
aside
and
motioned
but
the
time
has
come
to
bid
farewell
to
andikythera
ramirez
was
still
dragging
mannheim
along
as
they
passed
through
launch
pausing
only
to
nod
lightly
toward
the
two
pakistanis
who
immediately
snapped
to
attention
and
followed
amidst
all
the
excitement
of
the
pending
launch
nobody
seemed
to
notice
they
passed
through
the
outer
door
and
onto
the
tarmac
as
an
ensemble
ramirez
holding
mannheim
by
the
arm
and
guiding
him
bill
bates
looked
through
the
sikorsky
wide
windscreen
and
saw
them
coming
the
time
had
arrived
he
realized
immediately
to
make
a
move
now
or
never
the
israeli
attempt
to
pull
out
early
had
just
been
cut
off
at
the
pass
so
why
not
see
what
would
happen
if
the
scenario
got
shut
down
entirely
he
reduced
the
power
listening
to
the
engines
wind
down
and
rose
guess
my
part
of
this
is
over
he
announced
you
got
a
go
system
so
have
a
nice
day
i
be
seeing
you
around
peretz
eyes
momentarily
flashed
confusion
but
he
was
wily
enough
to
recover
immediately
your
help
has
been
much
appreciated
he
smiled
quickly
thank
you
for
checking
everything
out
should
i
tip
off
number
one
bates
asked
himself
no
that
flicker
is
nobody
fool
he
already
way
ahead
of
this
little
twerp
and
the
second
he
sets
foot
in
here
and
sees
that
dead
german
hood
going
to
be
a
lot
of
explaining
to
do
now
peretz
was
moving
jauntily
down
the
sikorsky
folding
steps
carrying
his
walther
with
an
air
that
proclaimed
nothing
amiss
time
to
get
out
of
here
bates
told
himself
there
going
to
be
hell
to
pay
he
rose
and
headed
down
the
stairs
after
peretz
as
rapidly
as
he
could
mike
where
you
been
he
waved
at
vance
we
ca
go
on
meeting
like
this
what
do
you
say
we
just
pack
it
all
in
and
go
sailing
fine
with
me
vance
yelled
back
no
time
like
the
present
at
that
moment
a
shot
rang
out
from
somewhere
in
the
direction
of
the
fallen
gantry
whereupon
peretz
whirled
leveled
his
walther
into
the
mist
and
got
off
a
burst
on
full
auto
emptying
the
clip
the
scene
froze
like
a
tableau
vance
first
thought
was
that
peretz
had
overreacted
nervous
and
probably
with
good
reason
but
at
least
cally
was
trying
to
do
her
share
the
problem
was
the
quarters
were
too
close
the
two
pakistanis
were
still
standing
on
the
tarmac
not
quite
understanding
what
was
happening
but
ramirez
sized
up
the
situation
in
an
instant
he
shoved
mannheim
up
the
steps
ahead
of
him
ducked
into
the
protection
of
the
sikorsky
open
door
and
then
turned
back
peretz
was
slower
caught
standing
on
the
foggy
tarmac
next
to
the
bottom
step
when
he
realized
his
walther
clip
was
empty
he
fished
another
out
of
his
pocket
and
quickly
began
trying
to
insert
it
that
wo
be
necessary
dr
peretz
ramirez
voice
was
like
steel
let
me
take
care
of
it
whereupon
he
leveled
his
beretta
and
shot
a
startled
abdoullah
squarely
between
the
eyes
before
shujat
realized
it
he
shot
him
too
point
blank
in
the
left
temple
what
in
hell
are
you
doing
peretz
yelled
watching
them
fall
he
was
still
trying
to
shove
a
new
clip
into
his
automatic
but
now
he
was
losing
his
touch
and
it
jammed
that
not
how
we
i
suppose
you
thought
me
some
kind
of
fool
ramirez
replied
shifting
his
aim
it
time
i
laid
that
fond
illusion
of
yours
to
rest
once
and
for
all
i
do
appreciate
your
tone
of
voice
peretz
was
still
struggling
frantically
with
his
walther
and
i
do
appreciate
you
trying
to
make
off
with
this
helicopter
we
have
just
lost
a
crucial
element
of
our
relationship
the
element
of
trust
i
never
knew
our
had
all
that
much
trust
in
it
peretz
looked
up
defiantly
we
had
a
business
arrangement
i
kept
up
my
end
to
the
letter
vance
watched
the
exchange
with
mixed
emotions
he
realized
that
peretz
being
no
idiot
knew
the
situation
had
just
gone
critical
he
had
begun
stalling
for
time
it
was
going
to
work
but
after
ramirez
finishes
with
this
computer
clown
he
told
himself
bill
and
i
are
next
and
with
that
thought
he
reached
around
under
his
shirt
and
circled
his
fingers
around
the
walther
he
had
been
right
it
over
you
little
son
of
a
bitch
ramirez
fired
point
blank
into
peretz
chest
the
israeli
jerked
backward
stumbled
and
crashed
slamming
his
head
against
the
hard
asphalt
he
did
move
vance
thought
now
it
our
turn
he
was
standing
next
to
bates
while
around
them
were
three
bodies
of
terrorists
ramirez
however
was
safely
inside
the
open
doorway
out
of
range
for
cally
does
she
realize
what
about
to
happen
she
must
have
because
just
as
ramirez
leveled
his
black
beretta
to
finish
off
what
he
had
started
there
was
another
burst
of
fire
from
the
direction
of
the
gantry
it
was
the
diversion
vance
needed
he
dove
for
the
tarmac
rolled
and
extracted
the
walther
he
had
shoved
into
his
belt
come
on
baby
keep
giving
me
cover
mike
bates
yelled
seeing
the
pistol
as
he
too
dove
for
the
tarmac
shoot
the
bastard
now
vance
aimed
for
the
doorway
but
it
was
already
closing
the
steps
coming
up
sabri
ramirez
was
not
a
man
to
engage
in
gunplay
for
the
fun
of
it
he
was
about
to
be
gone
a
second
later
the
main
rotor
which
had
been
idling
immediately
began
to
whine
into
acceleration
we
blew
it
bates
boomed
his
voice
now
almost
drowned
by
the
huge
ge
turboshafts
the
hyena
vance
muttered
pulling
himself
up
off
the
asphalt
headed
back
to
his
lair
and
there
not
a
damned
thing
anybody
can
do
about
it
not
with
isaac
on
board
bates
concurred
sorry
i
yelled
you
really
did
have
a
chance
he
was
shielding
himself
from
the
downdraft
as
he
tried
to
stand
up
the
fucker
is
getting
away
without
a
scratch
looks
like
he
pulled
it
off
right
vance
said
watching
the
giant
sikorsky
begin
to
lift
but
maybe
there
one
thing
left
we
can
do
how
about
trying
to
remove
that
bomb
he
pointed
up
at
before
that
thing
goes
up
what
in
hell
are
you
talking
about
bates
turned
to
squint
at
the
silver
spire
no
way
well
i
do
know
what
about
using
the
agusta
it
probably
still
flyable
he
had
turned
back
to
watch
the
sikorsky
bank
into
the
thinning
fog
ramirez
was
just
barely
visible
through
the
windscreen
smiling
as
he
disappeared
into
the
mist
there
no
time
peretz
told
me
that
is
set
to
lift
off
at
seven
the
bastard
had
it
timed
exactly
bates
glanced
at
his
watch
just
a
few
minutes
no
balls
vance
snorted
bill
for
godsake
let
give
it
a
shot
maybe
we
can
at
least
disable
it
turn
it
into
a
dud
bates
was
still
dubious
as
he
gazed
upward
buddy
i
do
want
to
be
hovering
over
that
thing
when
the
cyclops
kicks
in
do
you
realize
come
on
where
your
backbone
he
waved
to
cally
who
was
now
coming
around
the
corner
of
the
gantry
for
not
shooting
me
when
i
saw
ramirez
start
killing
everybody
i
assumed
you
two
were
next
it
was
then
or
never
she
looked
exhausted
you
assumed
right
we
were
on
the
hit
list
thanks
he
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
where
her
hair
was
still
plastered
now
will
you
help
me
talk
some
sense
into
this
guy
i
say
we
could
at
least
try
to
mess
up
the
bomb
before
the
cyclops
launches
it
they
got
it
programmed
for
souda
bay
you
kidding
bates
was
transfixed
that
what
he
claimed
come
on
let
hang
on
a
second
he
turned
and
trotted
over
to
the
doorway
of
launch
where
he
seized
a
coil
of
electrical
wire
this
may
come
in
handy
coming
back
he
punched
bates
arm
let
give
it
a
try
no
guts
no
glory
souda
bay
christ
bates
glanced
again
at
his
watch
mike
we
got
less
than
nine
minutes
i
copy
nichols
said
into
his
mike
when
did
the
chopper
lift
off
the
awacs
picked
it
up
at
just
after
hours
came
the
voice
from
the
kennedy
it
was
general
max
austin
the
bastards
are
bugging
out
so
what
do
we
do
now
try
and
intercept
them
we
taking
care
of
that
from
here
first
though
got
to
figure
out
if
there
really
are
hostages
aboard
like
they
claim
but
do
worry
about
it
there
nowhere
they
can
hide
your
mission
is
still
the
same
secure
the
facility
there
could
still
be
some
of
them
left
so
just
interdict
anything
that
tries
to
egress
that
a
confirm
if
it
moves
it
fucking
dies
chapter
nineteen
dawn
had
arrived
though
the
mantle
of
light
fog
was
still
adding
a
hazy
texture
to
the
air
the
had
a
freshness
that
reminded
vance
of
the
previous
morning
the
first
glimmerings
of
daybreak
now
though
visibility
was
hampered
by
the
residual
moisture
in
the
air
just
enough
to
give
the
world
a
pristine
sheen
what
would
the
morning
look
like
vance
wondered
if
a
nuclear
device
exploded
at
souda
bay
on
nearby
crete
it
was
a
possibility
difficult
to
imagine
but
the
results
were
not
bates
began
spooling
up
the
power
and
slowly
the
striped
agusta
mark
ii
started
lifting
off
the
pad
fortunately
it
had
been
prepped
the
previous
day
and
was
ready
to
fly
this
is
going
to
be
dicey
mike
bates
yelled
back
from
the
cockpit
his
voice
just
audible
above
the
roar
of
the
engines
i
do
know
how
exactly
you
expect
to
manage
this
i
do
know
either
vance
yelled
in
reply
try
and
see
if
you
can
hover
just
above
the
payload
bay
very
gently
cally
was
helping
him
circle
the
insulated
wire
about
his
waist
then
his
crotch
making
a
kind
of
seat
finally
he
handed
her
the
free
end
and
shouted
here
can
you
secure
this
around
something
around
what
she
yelled
back
anything
that
looks
sturdy
and
then
hang
onto
it
ever
done
this
before
she
had
found
a
steel
stmt
by
the
door
i
have
are
you
kidding
that
makes
us
equally
experienced
well
remember
one
thing
the
downdraft
from
the
main
rotor
is
going
to
buffet
you
like
crazy
be
prepared
right
he
was
already
trying
mental
games
to
avoid
vertigo
the
closest
thing
he
could
think
of
was
looking
out
the
windows
of
a
tall
building
and
even
that
scared
him
he
liked
working
close
to
the
ground
very
close
as
bates
guided
the
agusta
quickly
down
toward
the
launch
pad
and
the
vehicles
visibility
was
no
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
and
since
he
had
not
bothered
switching
on
the
radar
he
was
totally
unaware
of
the
two
apache
now
approaching
from
the
south
at
mph
it
was
a
mistake
sir
we
just
picked
up
some
new
action
on
the
island
manny
jackson
in
the
first
apache
said
into
his
radio
he
could
scarcely
wait
to
get
in
and
take
down
the
island
these
terrorists
needed
to
be
taught
a
lesson
once
and
for
all
he
had
lost
a
cousin
nineteen
years
old
in
the
beirut
bombing
and
this
was
the
closest
he
was
ever
going
to
get
to
a
payback
guess
there
were
more
of
the
bastards
ten
to
one
they
taking
up
another
chopper
no
way
are
we
going
to
allow
that
to
happen
nichols
declared
he
was
in
the
lead
huey
two
kilometers
back
the
first
batch
may
have
got
away
but
not
these
from
now
on
nobody
down
there
moves
a
hair
about
to
teach
them
a
thing
or
two
about
air
supremacy
they
do
seem
to
be
going
anywhere
just
moving
down
the
island
what
do
you
think
it
means
he
was
wondering
what
a
lot
of
it
meant
why
was
souda
bay
being
evacuated
they
were
calling
it
that
but
an
evacuation
was
exactly
what
was
under
way
a
big
to
get
the
fleet
into
blue
water
all
nonessentials
ordered
to
take
a
day
off
with
pay
a
sudden
token
of
thanks
from
uncle
sammy
for
jobs
well
done
bullshit
probably
picking
up
hostages
came
back
nichols
voice
who
the
hell
knows
but
our
mission
is
to
make
sure
they
do
leave
the
ground
you
got
it
sir
he
reached
down
to
the
weapons
station
and
flipped
the
red
switch
that
armed
the
hughes
chain
gun
its
twelve
hundred
rounds
he
figured
should
be
enough
to
handle
the
problem
what
in
blazes
is
he
doing
pierre
armont
wondered
aloud
he
was
standing
with
beginald
hall
at
the
southern
entrance
of
the
satcom
living
quarters
the
bates
motel
gazing
out
over
the
launch
pad
and
trying
to
make
sense
of
what
he
was
seeing
five
minutes
earlier
they
had
watched
in
dismay
as
the
sikorsky
lifted
off
now
this
looks
to
be
some
trapeze
stunt
reggie
hall
muttered
shaking
his
head
he
going
to
get
himself
killed
what
in
bloody
hell
he
caught
his
breath
as
he
watched
vance
begin
rappelling
down
some
kind
of
thin
line
dangling
out
the
open
door
of
the
chopper
spiraling
from
the
downdraft
of
the
main
rotor
it
was
something
of
a
circus
aerial
act
definitely
not
recommended
for
civilians
he
clearly
have
the
slightest
idea
how
to
use
his
arms
to
stabilize
the
spin
a
rank
amateur
what
was
that
sound
his
senses
quickened
and
he
turned
to
squint
at
the
southern
horizon
through
the
light
fog
he
could
hear
the
faint
beginnings
of
a
dull
familiar
roar
and
he
realized
immediately
it
was
choppers
coming
in
he
quickly
pulled
out
his
tasco
binoculars
and
studied
the
morning
sky
two
helos
both
looking
like
ungainly
spiders
yes
they
had
to
be
apaches
what
else
great
he
thought
once
more
the
has
got
its
timing
dead
on
the
first
time
they
showed
up
and
managed
to
keep
us
from
getting
ramirez
and
this
time
they
decide
to
drop
in
just
after
his
sikorsky
took
off
probably
taking
him
and
the
last
of
his
goons
out
undoubtedly
with
a
few
hostages
for
good
measure
from
all
appearances
he
had
gotten
away
again
it
was
sickening
now
the
gunships
were
dropping
altitude
and
moving
in
boldly
with
the
authority
their
firepower
commanded
he
wondered
if
the
teams
on
board
might
actually
be
unaware
that
ramirez
had
escaped
we
ought
to
go
out
and
signal
them
in
armont
said
let
them
know
how
useless
warning
flares
erupted
from
the
hughes
in
the
nose
of
the
first
apache
missing
the
agusta
by
no
more
than
fifty
meters
christ
they
do
know
who
the
friendlies
are
he
immediately
canceled
his
impromptu
plan
to
head
out
and
wave
the
army
was
in
no
mood
to
dialogue
do
they
think
mike
a
terrorist
reggie
asked
incredulous
but
even
as
he
said
it
he
realized
that
must
be
exactly
what
they
thought
they
were
going
to
try
to
force
down
the
agusta
or
shoot
it
down
reggie
draw
their
fire
armont
yelled
almost
by
instinct
he
raised
his
assault
rifle
and
opened
up
on
the
lead
helicopter
going
for
the
ge
turboshaft
on
the
left
do
try
to
kill
anybody
for
godsake
just
distract
them
is
insane
declared
willem
voorst
who
had
come
out
to
see
what
all
the
excitement
was
about
what
are
you
doing
i
do
want
to
go
to
war
with
the
united
states
of
america
then
he
noticed
the
agusta
hovering
over
vance
dangling
and
put
it
all
together
without
a
further
word
he
aimed
his
and
got
off
a
burst
watching
as
it
glinted
harmlessly
off
the
second
apache
left
wing
miraculously
it
worked
the
army
favorite
helicopters
were
huge
with
a
main
rotor
almost
fifty
feet
in
diameter
but
they
could
turn
on
a
dime
and
these
did
they
came
about
and
opened
fire
with
their
chain
guns
on
the
cinderblock
portico
where
armont
and
hall
and
voorst
were
ensconced
the
rounds
tore
around
them
sending
chunks
of
concrete
flying
but
the
structure
was
temporarily
solid
enough
to
provide
protection
armont
ducked
out
and
got
off
another
burst
keeping
on
the
heat
then
back
in
again
now
the
agusta
was
hovering
just
above
the
nose
of
the
vehicle
and
vance
had
disappeared
on
the
other
side
what
armont
wondered
again
could
he
possibly
be
doing
with
the
vehicle
then
the
answer
hit
him
as
transparent
as
day
he
going
to
try
and
retrieve
the
bomb
good
christ
he
thought
the
man
has
gone
mad
he
may
know
how
to
trace
hot
money
halfway
around
the
globe
but
he
does
know
zip
about
a
nuclear
device
he
probably
set
the
thing
off
by
accident
and
blow
the
entire
island
to
a
spray
of
cannon
fire
kicked
up
a
line
of
asphalt
next
to
where
he
was
standing
and
he
retreated
for
cover
deeper
behind
the
cinderblock
portico
they
not
going
to
fool
around
long
with
that
chain
gun
he
told
himself
we
going
to
be
looking
at
rockets
soon
and
then
game
up
we
done
what
we
can
for
michael
he
yelled
getting
off
one
last
burst
we
got
to
get
back
inside
before
they
get
tired
of
playing
around
and
just
fry
this
place
i
hear
you
willem
voorst
agreed
already
headed
deeper
inside
mike
on
his
own
vance
had
never
been
more
scared
in
his
life
this
made
a
day
at
a
stormy
helm
seem
like
a
sunday
stroll
the
was
spinning
him
violently
now
a
lesson
that
rappelling
was
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
then
he
remembered
some
basic
physics
and
held
out
his
arms
helplessly
flapping
like
a
wounded
bird
but
it
was
enough
as
his
spin
immediately
slowed
he
was
dizzy
now
but
when
he
came
around
he
got
an
overview
of
the
launch
facility
and
the
glimpse
made
him
realize
that
something
had
gone
terribly
wrong
what
were
those
two
apache
helicopters
were
hovering
and
they
were
firing
on
on
the
bates
motel
just
beyond
the
fallen
gantry
why
ramirez
and
all
his
goons
were
gone
or
dead
bill
bates
who
also
had
seen
it
all
had
a
better
understanding
of
what
was
under
way
it
was
a
massive
failure
of
communications
thinking
as
quickly
as
he
could
he
started
negotiating
the
agusta
around
situating
between
him
and
the
apaches
the
fucking
delta
force
had
come
in
like
gangbusters
and
was
shooting
at
the
wrong
target
there
was
no
time
to
try
to
raise
them
on
the
radio
and
besides
he
only
had
two
hands
down
below
vance
slammed
against
the
hard
metal
of
the
nose
and
then
rotated
to
try
to
take
measure
of
what
to
do
next
it
was
going
to
be
easy
that
much
was
sure
the
payload
bay
was
sealed
with
a
teflon
ring
which
was
itself
secured
with
a
series
of
streamlined
clamps
that
were
bolted
from
inside
designed
for
automated
control
but
there
also
was
lettering
next
to
a
hatch
that
read
emergency
release
he
flipped
it
open
and
bracing
himself
against
the
side
of
the
silver
cone
to
try
to
overcome
the
destabilizing
draft
looked
in
a
red
button
held
down
for
safety
by
another
thumb
latch
stared
back
what
the
heck
he
thought
you
got
nothing
to
lose
he
flipped
the
thumb
safety
and
then
bracing
himself
to
try
to
slow
his
erratic
spin
slammed
a
heel
into
the
button
nothing
happened
for
a
second
but
then
the
teflon
clamps
on
the
cargo
bay
began
to
click
open
one
by
one
up
above
him
cally
was
yelling
something
but
he
could
make
out
her
voice
above
the
roar
of
the
engines
anyway
whatever
it
was
it
would
have
to
wait
there
was
only
one
thing
left
to
do
and
he
had
to
press
on
the
clamps
were
now
released
but
the
cargo
bay
was
still
closed
at
that
moment
he
began
experiencing
yet
another
failure
of
nerve
there
could
only
be
a
minute
left
two
at
most
and
he
did
have
the
slightest
idea
what
to
do
next
then
he
noticed
the
heavy
release
levers
positioned
beneath
the
teflon
clamps
and
circling
the
three
sides
of
the
streamlined
door
once
more
bracing
himself
against
the
slippery
side
of
the
nose
he
began
clicking
them
open
starting
on
the
left
and
working
his
way
around
time
is
surely
running
out
he
told
himself
this
could
end
up
being
the
stupidest
stunt
ever
attempted
the
roar
of
the
agusta
above
was
so
deafening
he
could
barely
think
he
felt
all
of
his
years
a
weight
crushing
down
on
him
with
the
finality
of
eternity
then
the
last
clamp
snapped
free
and
he
watched
as
the
door
opened
by
itself
slowly
swinging
upward
it
was
heavy
shaped
like
the
pressure
door
on
an
airplane
fuselage
and
designed
to
withstand
the
frictional
heat
of
space
flight
but
the
spring
mountings
on
the
recessed
hinges
were
intended
to
open
and
close
automatically
and
there
sat
a
metallic
sphere
outfitted
with
a
jumble
of
connectors
and
switches
so
that
what
a
bomb
looks
like
he
marveled
it
was
somehow
nothing
like
he
had
imagined
if
he
had
had
time
to
imagine
now
bates
had
lowered
the
helo
just
enough
to
allow
him
to
slide
inside
and
take
the
weight
off
the
line
finally
he
could
breathe
but
again
the
matter
of
passing
seconds
had
all
his
attention
if
the
vehicle
really
was
going
up
at
then
there
probably
was
less
than
a
minute
left
now
to
get
the
device
unhooked
and
out
he
looked
it
over
puzzling
and
decided
on
one
giant
gamble
one
turn
of
the
wheel
it
was
a
terrifying
feeling
quickly
he
untied
the
wire
from
around
his
waist
and
began
looping
it
around
the
metal
sphere
once
twice
three
times
there
was
no
time
and
no
way
to
disconnect
the
telemetry
so
the
device
would
simply
have
to
be
ripped
out
one
thing
was
sure
if
it
blew
he
would
never
be
the
wiser
when
he
had
the
wire
secure
or
as
secure
as
he
could
make
it
he
looked
out
the
door
and
gave
cally
a
sign
hoping
she
would
understand
she
did
she
turned
and
yelled
something
to
bates
and
a
moment
later
the
agusta
began
to
power
out
as
the
pitch
of
the
blades
slowly
changed
the
line
grew
taut
then
strained
against
the
sides
of
the
bomb
tightening
his
knots
will
the
wire
hold
he
wondered
and
does
this
little
toy
helo
have
enough
lift
to
yank
this
thing
out
of
here
it
like
pulling
a
giant
tooth
then
there
was
a
ripping
sound
as
the
connectors
attached
to
the
sphere
began
tearing
loose
so
far
so
good
he
thought
at
least
the
telemetry
is
now
history
if
the
vehicle
goes
up
now
it
be
orbiting
a
dud
mission
partly
accomplished
then
the
bomb
pulled
away
from
its
last
moorings
and
slammed
against
the
side
of
the
door
leaving
him
pinned
against
the
frame
unable
to
breathe
but
he
instinctively
grabbed
the
line
and
wrapped
his
legs
around
the
sphere
just
as
it
rotated
and
broke
free
as
it
bumped
against
the
doorframe
of
the
payload
bay
he
barely
missed
hitting
the
closing
door
but
he
ducked
and
swung
free
into
the
open
air
riding
the
device
as
though
it
were
a
giant
wrecking
ball
those
bastards
firing
on
us
have
gone
inside
philip
sexton
yelled
let
them
wait
let
stop
the
damned
chopper
from
egressing
he
was
pointing
through
the
windscreen
of
the
apache
orders
are
to
keep
everybody
on
the
ground
manny
jackson
hit
the
pedals
nothing
to
it
there
almost
in
his
sights
was
the
striped
agusta
chopper
with
a
terrorist
hanging
beneath
it
probably
fell
out
he
was
hanging
on
to
something
though
what
it
was
you
really
could
tell
through
the
thin
mist
it
did
matter
the
guy
was
open
and
in
the
clear
this
was
the
beginning
of
what
was
going
to
be
a
marvelous
operation
taking
these
bastards
down
with
a
feeling
of
immense
satisfaction
he
reached
for
the
weapons
station
and
then
his
world
went
blue
cally
stared
out
the
open
door
of
the
agusta
and
felt
her
heart
skip
a
beat
a
beam
of
energy
so
strong
it
ionized
the
air
and
turned
it
deep
mauve
seemed
to
be
engulfing
michael
staring
down
she
was
almost
blinded
by
its
intensity
he
was
there
she
was
sure
but
where
she
could
not
tell
then
it
shut
off
for
a
second
and
she
realized
it
had
been
directed
toward
the
base
of
next
came
an
enormous
clap
of
thunder
as
the
splintered
air
collapsed
on
itself
sending
out
shock
waves
just
like
lightning
she
thought
the
cyclops
is
sending
energy
as
though
it
were
lightning
then
the
blue
flashed
again
and
this
time
it
began
microsecond
pulses
like
a
massive
strobe
light
all
the
action
was
now
highlighted
in
jerky
snippets
of
vision
as
unreal
as
a
disco
dance
floor
the
air
around
the
beam
was
being
turned
to
plasma
ionized
pure
atoms
but
the
next
burst
of
energy
came
from
the
propulsion
unit
of
which
slowly
began
discharging
a
concentrated
plume
out
of
its
nozzles
a
primal
green
instead
of
the
usual
reds
and
oranges
of
a
conventional
rocket
the
cyclops
had
just
gone
critical
right
on
the
money
ionizing
the
propellant
in
would
the
impulse
be
enough
to
lift
it
off
she
wondered
was
isaac
grand
scheme
going
to
work
years
had
been
spent
planning
for
this
moment
she
felt
her
heart
stop
as
she
waited
for
the
answer
totally
forgetting
the
man
who
was
dangling
just
below
the
chopper
bathed
in
the
hard
pulsing
strobes
as
manny
jackson
grappled
for
the
collective
blinded
by
the
intense
monochromatic
light
engulfing
him
a
clap
of
thunder
sounded
about
his
ears
deafening
him
to
the
roar
of
the
apache
turboshafts
what
in
hell
had
one
of
the
nuclear
devices
been
detonated
no
his
instincts
lectured
he
was
still
alive
if
it
had
been
a
nuke
he
would
be
atoms
by
now
sprayed
into
space
this
had
to
be
something
else
now
his
vision
was
returning
the
blue
receding
into
quick
flashes
and
the
chopper
seemed
to
be
stabilizing
maybe
he
thought
i
not
going
to
be
permanently
blind
but
i
got
to
get
this
bird
on
the
ground
we
just
have
to
take
our
chances
then
the
realization
of
what
had
happened
finally
sank
in
the
damned
cyclops
laser
had
switched
on
they
had
arrived
too
late
he
was
thrown
against
the
windscreen
as
the
apache
slammed
into
the
asphalt
and
collapsed
the
starboard
leg
of
the
retractable
gear
jesus
he
turned
back
to
the
cabin
forehead
bleeding
and
yelled
everybody
okay
the
assault
team
was
still
strapped
in
and
nobody
seemed
the
worse
for
the
bumpy
landing
the
apache
was
a
tough
bird
hero
of
tank
battles
in
iraq
no
problem
came
back
a
chorus
of
yells
they
were
already
unfastening
their
straps
and
readying
their
weapons
all
right
he
bellowed
killing
the
power
everybody
out
let
take
cover
and
kick
ass
vance
heard
the
thunder
and
felt
the
shock
wave
almost
simultaneously
he
gripped
the
wire
trying
to
hold
on
and
felt
it
cut
deep
into
his
palms
the
pain
seemed
to
work
in
opposition
to
the
numbing
effects
of
the
shock
wave
that
had
buffeted
him
assaulting
his
eardrums
and
his
consciousness
for
a
moment
he
forgot
where
he
was
shut
out
all
thought
and
just
hung
onto
the
wire
with
his
last
remaining
energy
in
the
agusta
up
above
bates
was
struggling
with
the
controls
trying
to
keep
stabilized
as
the
pressure
pulse
from
the
cyclops
swept
down
the
island
the
dangling
bomb
and
vance
were
serving
as
a
counterweight
holding
the
small
commercial
helo
aright
it
was
all
that
kept
it
from
flipping
as
the
sudden
turbulence
assaulted
the
main
rotor
the
energy
that
filled
the
air
now
had
yet
another
release
as
his
eardrums
recovered
vance
heard
a
new
roar
deeper
and
throatier
than
the
sound
of
the
agusta
welling
up
around
him
down
below
wave
after
wave
of
pressure
pulses
were
drumming
the
air
and
he
watched
spellbound
as
shuddered
then
began
to
inch
upward
into
the
morning
sky
it
was
a
gorgeous
sight
the
of
the
world
first
space
vehicle
was
cally
watching
this
moment
of
triumph
he
wondered
she
should
be
ecstatic
even
in
spite
of
all
the
rest
but
would
the
vehicle
make
it
to
orbit
he
suddenly
asked
himself
with
the
payload
gone
would
the
weight
parameters
be
all
out
of
whack
but
then
maybe
it
did
matter
the
mere
fact
that
it
was
going
up
should
be
enough
to
cover
bates
contractual
obligations
with
his
investors
that
was
down
the
road
he
was
so
mesmerized
by
the
sight
of
the
off
that
he
had
totally
forgotten
he
was
wrapped
around
a
nuke
hanging
on
for
all
he
had
as
the
asphalt
loomed
fifty
feet
below
like
slim
pickens
riding
the
bomb
down
in
that
famous
closing
scene
from
kubrick
strangelove
then
the
pain
in
his
hands
refocused
his
attention
the
bomb
down
below
he
figured
was
now
permanently
inoperable
but
ramirez
still
had
mannheim
as
a
hostage
and
he
had
made
good
his
escape
which
meant
he
was
still
in
the
terrorists
catbird
seat
using
innocents
for
a
shield
rather
than
slugging
it
out
fair
and
square
as
the
cyclops
continued
to
pulse
and
edged
upward
into
the
morning
mist
bates
steered
the
agusta
toward
the
old
landing
pad
where
it
had
originally
been
parked
in
moments
he
had
eased
down
the
bomb
just
as
though
settling
in
a
crate
of
eggs
no
more
than
twenty
feet
from
where
they
had
taken
off
five
minutes
earlier
it
was
a
marvel
of
professionalism
as
the
weapon
bumped
onto
the
asphalt
vance
had
a
sudden
thought
the
damned
thing
was
useless
now
and
harmless
but
what
about
the
other
one
the
one
ramirez
had
taken
with
him
in
the
sikorsky
michael
are
you
all
right
cally
had
leapt
from
the
open
door
of
the
agusta
looking
as
disoriented
as
he
had
ever
seen
her
you
were
only
a
few
feet
away
when
the
cyclops
turned
on
for
a
minute
there
i
could
even
see
you
what
was
it
like
try
the
end
of
the
world
like
a
thousand
bolts
of
lightning
all
aimed
at
one
place
a
perfect
description
she
smiled
and
reached
to
help
him
stand
up
i
never
realized
there
be
a
thunderclap
when
it
switched
on
at
full
power
god
what
a
sight
she
was
beaming
at
the
thought
exhilarated
that
all
satcom
work
had
been
vindicated
you
know
he
said
speaking
of
the
end
of
the
world
we
came
pretty
close
i
hate
to
think
what
would
happen
if
a
bomb
actually
went
off
on
crete
i
got
a
sinking
feeling
the
end
of
the
road
was
going
to
be
crete
at
all
bates
declared
stepping
down
from
the
agusta
been
thinking
something
that
little
israeli
prick
let
drop
as
we
were
coming
out
to
start
up
the
sikorsky
finally
sank
in
he
was
rambling
on
about
retargeting
the
vehicle
you
know
i
think
it
was
going
to
come
back
here
he
had
the
trajectory
set
to
begin
and
end
right
here
on
andikythera
after
he
bugged
out
of
course
nice
vance
said
i
actually
kind
of
admire
his
balls
he
was
going
to
nuke
ramirez
and
us
that
part
a
little
harder
to
like
i
grant
you
he
turned
and
gazed
down
toward
the
two
apaches
that
had
landed
by
the
way
what
were
those
all
about
the
delta
force
saving
us
who
knows
he
seemed
to
have
a
sudden
thought
let
me
get
on
the
radio
and
try
to
call
them
off
before
they
actually
end
up
killing
somebody
while
you
doing
that
i
like
to
try
and
raise
pierre
find
out
what
happening
at
his
end
there
a
in
the
cockpit
bates
said
use
it
michael
thank
god
it
you
armont
said
into
the
mike
guess
what
we
almost
went
to
war
against
the
special
forces
we
have
just
surrendered
incidentally
nice
work
up
there
or
maybe
you
just
got
lucky
he
laughed
seeing
you
rappelling
leads
me
to
suggest
that
you
probably
ought
to
stick
to
other
lines
of
work
i
hear
you
vance
said
by
the
way
the
bad
news
is
ramirez
got
away
so
he
was
in
the
sikorsky
armont
sighed
with
resignation
blast
i
was
afraid
of
that
well
this
may
not
be
over
yet
the
vehicle
got
up
but
we
not
quite
sure
where
it
headed
bomb
or
no
bomb
i
want
to
try
to
get
into
command
or
what
left
of
it
and
try
to
find
out
before
some
delta
cowboy
fires
a
hellfire
missile
in
there
good
idea
armont
agreed
it
would
also
be
nice
to
keep
a
handle
on
ramirez
getaway
chopper
but
i
assume
somebody
will
interdict
him
the
almighty
navy
owns
this
airspace
as
we
found
out
the
hard
way
do
count
on
anything
he
took
along
mannheim
as
a
hostage
insurance
this
guy
is
no
slouch
i
be
willing
to
bet
he
got
something
up
his
sleeve
one
thing
he
got
is
at
least
one
more
bomb
bill
saw
it
on
the
chopper
and
he
might
be
just
crazy
enough
to
use
it
god
knows
where
then
i
do
know
what
the
can
do
if
he
got
a
hostage
and
a
bomb
they
sure
as
hell
not
going
to
shoot
him
down
where
do
you
think
he
headed
that
question
number
two
but
if
we
can
get
into
command
maybe
we
can
figure
out
a
way
to
track
him
from
there
somehow
good
luck
armont
said
quietly
and
with
feeling
and
stay
in
touch
dore
peretz
chest
still
felt
like
it
was
on
fire
a
burning
sensation
that
seemed
to
spread
across
the
entire
front
of
his
torso
in
fact
he
felt
like
shit
and
he
had
almost
been
blinded
by
the
intense
blue
laser
strobes
that
had
purged
the
island
when
the
cyclops
kicked
on
however
in
all
the
confusion
surrounding
the
of
nobody
had
bothered
to
wonder
where
he
was
that
part
suited
him
fine
donning
the
bulletproof
vest
around
midnight
had
been
the
best
idea
of
his
life
no
that
was
true
the
best
of
all
was
coming
up
sometimes
he
thought
life
could
have
a
moment
so
delicious
it
made
up
for
all
your
past
disappointments
and
you
could
either
seize
that
moment
or
you
could
forever
let
it
pass
wondering
what
it
would
have
been
like
not
this
one
baby
as
he
passed
through
the
lobby
he
noticed
the
security
door
leading
into
command
had
been
blown
away
with
some
kind
of
military
explosive
probably
curious
he
paused
and
assessed
the
damage
hey
the
television
down
in
launch
had
really
done
the
assault
justice
must
have
been
one
hell
of
a
show
then
he
stepped
inside
and
checked
out
the
scene
jesus
the
place
was
a
mess
showed
all
the
signs
of
a
bloody
assault
luckily
however
the
emergency
lights
were
working
their
harsh
beams
perfect
for
what
he
wanted
to
do
now
there
was
definitely
plenty
of
evidence
of
gunfire
flecked
plaster
from
the
walls
and
over
there
christ
it
was
jamal
or
what
was
left
of
jamal
little
fucker
neck
looked
like
he
had
a
close
encounter
with
a
chain
saw
not
far
away
was
salim
shot
in
the
face
then
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
was
the
body
of
the
last
german
stasi
peter
maier
his
demise
had
come
neatly
right
between
the
eyes
smooth
piece
of
work
you
had
to
admit
the
only
asshole
unaccounted
for
was
moreau
so
what
happened
to
that
arrogant
french
prick
did
he
escape
get
captured
who
gave
a
shit
meditations
on
fate
the
absolute
the
truth
was
it
was
more
than
a
little
chilling
to
see
the
bodies
of
three
dudes
you
come
in
with
only
a
day
before
well
fuck
it
these
other
guys
had
known
the
risks
if
they
did
then
they
were
jerks
down
to
business
he
knew
what
he
was
looking
for
and
he
had
left
it
next
to
the
main
terminal
and
there
it
was
while
he
was
working
he
would
block
out
the
ache
in
his
chest
by
thinking
about
the
money
hundreds
of
millions
tax
free
even
if
you
spent
ten
million
a
year
you
could
never
spend
it
all
what
a
dream
then
he
had
an
even
more
comforting
reflection
everybody
had
seen
him
shot
they
would
find
the
body
but
they
would
naturally
assume
he
was
dead
too
he
would
have
the
money
and
he
would
be
officially
deceased
he
almost
laughed
but
then
he
sobered
recalling
he
had
only
a
scant
few
minutes
to
wrap
things
up
he
slipped
the
component
into
its
slot
then
rummaged
around
for
the
connectors
he
had
left
them
dangling
when
he
removed
the
black
box
and
they
were
conveniently
at
hand
they
were
and
besides
he
had
a
perfect
photographic
memory
and
knew
exactly
what
went
where
seconds
later
the
diodes
gleamed
on
line
okay
baby
let
crank
the
real
radio
gear
he
knew
was
in
bates
office
which
stood
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
its
door
blown
away
bates
had
plenty
of
transmission
and
receiving
equipment
in
there
so
that
would
be
the
perfect
place
to
take
care
of
business
he
picked
up
the
device
now
ready
and
carried
it
with
him
heading
over
the
main
power
switch
that
controlled
bates
radios
had
been
shut
off
but
it
was
just
outside
the
door
and
easy
to
access
he
pushed
up
the
red
handle
and
walked
on
through
watching
with
satisfaction
as
the
gear
came
alive
over
by
the
desk
was
bates
main
radio
a
big
magellan
already
warming
up
life
was
sweet
he
clicked
on
the
receiver
stationed
next
to
the
transmitter
and
began
scanning
ramirez
he
figured
would
probably
be
on
the
military
frequencies
now
spewing
out
a
barrage
of
threats
about
blowing
up
andikythera
that
had
been
the
egress
strategy
assuming
the
confusion
created
when
the
bomb
took
out
souda
bay
was
enough
and
sure
enough
there
he
was
on
megahertz
just
as
planned
peretz
decided
to
listen
for
a
minute
or
so
before
breaking
in
i
wo
bother
giving
you
our
coordinates
came
his
voice
since
we
show
a
radar
lock
already
i
warn
you
again
that
any
attempt
to
interfere
with
our
egress
will
mean
the
death
of
our
hostage
and
a
nuclear
explosion
on
the
island
how
about
that
peretz
thought
the
getaway
scenario
is
still
intact
right
down
to
the
last
detail
gives
you
a
warm
feeling
about
the
continuity
of
human
designs
he
and
sabri
ramirez
had
planned
it
carefully
the
sikorsky
would
be
taken
to
fifteen
thousand
feet
its
service
ceiling
whereupon
anybody
left
would
be
shot
the
controls
would
then
be
locked
and
they
would
don
oxygen
masks
and
jump
using
parachutes
the
rectangular
chutes
that
actually
are
a
airfoil
had
a
forward
speed
of
miles
per
hour
and
could
stay
up
long
enough
to
put
at
least
that
many
miles
between
the
jump
point
and
the
landing
they
were
in
effect
makeshift
gliders
and
they
presented
absolutely
no
radar
signature
while
the
sikorsky
continued
on
its
merry
way
on
autopilot
they
would
rendezvous
with
the
boat
that
was
waiting
then
be
off
to
sicily
with
nobody
the
wiser
the
chopper
would
eventually
crash
into
the
ocean
halfway
to
cypress
leaving
no
trace
the
only
part
about
that
plan
that
bothered
dore
peretz
from
the
first
was
whether
sabri
ramirez
was
intending
to
kill
him
along
with
the
rest
of
the
exit
team
nothing
would
prevent
it
there
was
supposed
to
be
some
honor
among
thieves
but
enough
nostalgia
the
moment
had
come
to
have
a
little
fun
he
flicked
on
the
mike
yo
my
man
this
is
your
technical
associate
do
you
copy
there
was
a
pause
in
the
transmission
then
ramirez
voice
came
on
loud
and
clear
get
off
this
channel
whoever
you
are
hey
dude
is
that
any
way
to
talk
we
have
a
little
business
to
finish
by
the
way
how
the
weather
up
there
chutes
still
look
okay
what
in
hell
came
back
the
voice
now
abruptly
flustered
as
the
recognition
came
through
where
are
you
dead
i
guess
but
hey
i
lonesome
maybe
it
slipped
your
mind
i
was
supposed
to
be
part
of
the
evacuation
team
what
do
you
want
want
well
let
see
how
about
starting
with
a
little
respect
fuck
you
peretz
now
is
that
any
way
to
talk
if
that
how
you
feel
then
i
just
thought
of
another
small
request
i
also
want
you
to
transfer
your
part
of
the
money
into
my
account
at
banco
ambrosiano
as
a
small
gesture
of
respect
i
want
you
to
get
on
the
radio
and
see
about
having
it
arranged
or
i
might
just
blow
the
scenario
for
you
he
had
to
laugh
there
was
radio
silence
as
ramirez
appeared
to
be
contemplating
this
alternative
it
clearly
was
unpalatable
you
got
a
problem
there
my
friend
one
of
time
i
sure
being
monitored
so
let
me
just
say
there
been
a
change
of
plans
you
would
have
been
part
of
it
but
unfortunately
hey
asshole
there
no
change
of
plans
you
figured
it
for
this
way
all
along
but
now
there
is
going
to
be
a
change
i
hate
to
tell
you
what
the
new
scenario
is
yo
hang
on
a
sec
he
had
looked
up
to
see
bill
bates
and
michael
vance
entering
the
office
come
on
in
and
join
the
fun
guys
he
waved
his
walther
and
grinned
we
about
to
have
a
blast
vance
walked
through
the
door
bloody
and
exhausted
and
i
thought
ramirez
was
the
only
one
who
could
manage
to
return
from
the
dead
he
tried
to
smile
but
his
face
hurt
too
much
either
he
was
using
blanks
or
you
were
wearing
a
bulletproof
vest
somehow
i
doubt
it
was
the
former
so
what
happened
have
a
business
disagreement
with
your
partner
in
crime
peretz
was
grinning
that
how
it
is
in
life
sometimes
man
friendship
is
fleeting
he
gestured
them
forward
bates
had
moved
in
warily
still
stunned
by
the
carnage
among
the
workstations
in
command
i
suppose
i
have
you
and
ramirez
to
thank
for
tearing
up
the
place
out
there
he
walked
over
to
the
desk
nice
to
see
that
my
radio
gear
is
back
on
and
working
it
working
fine
peretz
replied
then
waved
his
walther
toward
the
couch
opposite
the
desk
now
sit
the
fuck
down
both
of
you
you
staring
at
beaucoup
hard
time
pal
vance
did
not
move
i
can
think
of
several
countries
who
going
to
be
fighting
over
the
chance
to
put
you
away
this
might
be
a
propitious
moment
to
consider
going
quietly
quietly
there
was
a
mad
gleam
in
his
eye
i
never
did
anything
quietly
in
my
life
you
in
luck
asshole
you
about
to
have
a
seat
at
history
in
the
making
he
turned
back
to
the
radio
and
switched
to
transmit
yo
my
man
looks
like
we
have
nothing
more
to
say
to
each
other
which
means
time
for
a
fond
farewell
what
he
about
to
do
vance
wondered
he
about
to
screw
sabri
ramirez
but
how
then
it
dawned
there
was
one
bomb
left
and
bill
had
said
it
was
on
the
sikorsky
probably
and
peretz
had
a
radio
right
there
god
help
us
hey
he
almost
yelled
get
serious
what
you
about
to
do
is
insane
you
do
use
a
nuke
to
take
out
a
single
thug
even
a
thug
like
sabri
ramirez
you
gone
crazy
in
fact
vance
told
himself
peretz
was
looking
a
little
more
than
a
little
mad
he
had
a
distant
fix
in
his
visage
that
was
absolutely
chilling
the
world
had
been
waiting
decades
now
for
a
nutcake
to
get
his
hands
on
a
nuclear
trigger
maybe
the
wait
was
over
look
peckerhead
i
sorry
if
you
find
this
unsettling
peretz
was
still
holding
the
walther
however
do
get
any
funny
ideas
he
laughed
you
know
it
almost
poetic
for
years
now
israel
has
been
the
world
biggest
secret
nuclear
power
but
nobody
ever
had
the
balls
to
show
our
stuff
i
about
to
become
my
nation
most
daring
citizen
he
turned
back
to
the
radio
you
still
there
asshole
there
was
no
reply
the
radio
voice
of
sabri
ramirez
did
come
back
he
jumped
peretz
looked
up
and
grinned
a
demented
grin
he
in
the
air
perfect
now
he
get
to
watch
he
plugged
in
the
device
he
had
been
carrying
a
uhf
transmitter
then
he
flicked
it
to
transmit
checked
the
liquid
crystals
that
told
its
frequency
and
reached
for
a
red
switch
no
vance
lunged
trying
to
seize
the
walther
as
he
shoved
peretz
against
the
instruments
the
crazy
son
of
a
bitch
was
actually
going
to
do
it
peretz
was
strong
with
the
hidden
strength
of
the
terminally
mad
and
after
only
a
second
vance
realized
he
did
have
a
chance
he
was
too
beat
up
and
exhausted
bill
bates
too
was
suffering
from
absolute
fatigue
but
he
also
leapt
forward
grappling
with
peretz
and
trying
to
seize
his
automatic
with
vance
as
a
distraction
bates
managed
to
turn
the
pistol
upward
peretz
was
still
gripping
it
like
a
vise
however
and
at
that
moment
it
discharged
on
automatic
sending
a
spray
of
rounds
across
the
ceiling
vance
tried
to
duck
away
and
as
he
did
peretz
kneed
him
shoving
him
to
the
floor
bates
however
still
had
a
grip
on
his
right
wrist
holding
the
pistol
out
of
range
again
it
erupted
another
hail
of
automatic
fire
but
as
it
did
bates
managed
to
shove
peretz
against
the
desk
grabbing
his
right
elbow
and
twisting
the
walther
came
around
locked
on
full
automatic
and
caught
dore
peretz
in
the
side
of
his
face
as
blood
splattered
across
the
room
bates
staggered
back
while
peretz
collapsed
onto
the
desk
with
a
scream
then
twisted
directly
across
the
transmitter
he
was
dead
instantly
and
as
he
crumpled
to
the
floor
almost
by
magic
the
background
noise
from
the
radio
on
the
sikorsky
stopped
replaced
by
a
sterile
hiss
thank
god
bates
whispered
breathless
and
reached
to
help
vance
up
are
you
okay
mike
i
think
so
he
mumbled
rising
to
one
trembling
knee
at
least
we
the
room
shook
as
a
blistering
shock
wave
rolled
over
the
island
outside
the
distant
sky
above
the
eastern
mediterranean
turned
bright
as
the
midday
sun
fifteen
thousand
feet
above
the
aegean
a
blinding
whiteness
appeared
unlike
anything
a
living
greek
had
ever
seen
chapter
twenty
my
god
the
president
muttered
settling
the
red
phone
into
its
cradle
they
did
it
the
bastards
detonated
one
of
them
nsa
says
their
sigint
capabilities
in
the
med
just
went
blank
an
electromagnetic
pulse
i
do
believe
it
morton
davies
declared
sitting
on
the
edge
of
his
hard
chair
the
chief
of
staff
looked
as
incredulous
as
he
felt
we
tracking
their
helicopter
with
one
of
the
awacs
we
brought
up
from
rijad
the
minute
they
set
down
we
going
to
pick
them
up
rescue
mannheim
and
any
other
hostages
and
nail
the
bastards
they
know
they
ca
get
away
so
why
he
threatened
to
nuke
the
island
hansen
went
on
but
i
assumed
that
had
to
be
a
bluff
why
in
hell
would
he
want
to
go
ahead
and
do
it
it
did
buy
him
anything
at
this
stage
edward
briggs
was
on
a
blue
phone
at
the
other
end
of
the
situation
room
receiving
an
intelligence
update
from
operations
in
the
pentagon
as
he
cradled
the
receiver
he
looked
down
not
sure
how
to
tell
johan
hansen
what
he
had
just
learned
mannheim
what
the
matter
ed
i
do
like
that
look
what
did
mr
president
he
seemed
barely
able
to
form
the
words
our
people
just
got
a
better
handle
on
it
was
andikythera
what
hansen
jerked
his
head
around
puzzlement
in
his
deep
eyes
what
do
you
mean
good
christ
not
souda
bay
surely
they
did
the
detonation
our
awacs
flying
out
of
southern
turkey
monitored
it
at
around
fifteen
thousand
feet
as
best
they
can
tell
they
still
what
say
it
looked
to
be
about
seventy
miles
out
over
the
eastern
med
in
the
direction
of
cypress
which
is
exactly
where
they
were
tracking
you
mean
his
voice
trailed
off
right
briggs
said
finally
they
think
it
was
the
helicopter
the
one
they
were
flying
out
an
old
sikorsky
series
we
believe
it
what
are
you
saying
hansen
found
himself
refusing
to
believe
it
those
idiots
nuked
themselves
what
the
hell
was
the
pentagon
talking
about
my
god
isaac
was
does
exactly
figure
does
it
briggs
nodded
lamely
electromagnetic
pulse
knocked
out
all
our
surveillance
electronics
in
the
region
but
souda
intel
section
was
into
our
backup
and
they
claim
they
triangulated
it
everything
sketchy
but
that
seems
to
be
what
happened
i
ca
believe
it
hansen
said
running
his
hands
over
his
face
they
were
trembling
the
whole
situation
must
have
gotten
away
from
him
that
the
only
way
it
must
have
been
a
macabre
accident
christ
a
damned
ghastly
one
briggs
agreed
but
i
think
you
right
it
the
only
explanation
that
makes
any
sense
hansen
went
on
he
probably
decided
to
take
one
of
the
bombs
with
him
hoping
to
try
this
again
and
something
went
haywire
he
suddenly
tried
a
sad
smile
you
know
i
warned
that
son
of
a
bitch
he
did
know
what
he
was
doing
that
he
probably
end
up
blowing
himself
up
truthfully
i
really
think
it
would
actually
happen
though
he
turned
back
to
briggs
the
pakistanis
said
the
weapons
they
had
were
about
ten
or
fifteen
kilotons
how
big
is
that
ed
in
english
okay
briggs
said
pausing
for
effect
that
would
be
like
a
sized
tactical
i
guess
truthfully
he
was
exactly
sure
well
hansen
mused
i
still
convinced
they
intended
it
for
souda
bay
and
if
they
succeeded
but
as
it
stands
i
guess
it
was
more
like
a
small
nuclear
test
a
tactical
nuke
you
say
the
very
term
is
an
obscenity
but
you
know
nato
had
those
all
over
germany
not
so
long
ago
on
the
sick
assumption
that
the
german
people
could
wait
to
nuke
their
own
cities
after
a
long
moment
during
which
a
thoughtful
silence
held
the
room
hansen
continued
tell
me
ed
what
kind
of
impact
would
a
weapon
like
that
actually
have
at
that
altitude
my
guess
is
the
effects
will
be
reasonably
contained
he
was
doing
some
quick
mental
calculus
okay
if
you
were
directly
under
it
have
been
about
three
miles
away
so
you
have
taken
a
shock
wave
that
would
have
knocked
out
windows
and
maybe
produced
some
flash
burns
but
we
had
the
region
cleared
of
civilian
traffic
so
maybe
we
okay
on
that
score
what
about
fallout
hansen
asked
well
at
that
altitude
the
radioactive
contamination
should
be
mostly
trapped
in
the
upper
atmosphere
and
take
several
days
to
start
settling
by
that
time
it
probably
be
diluted
to
the
point
it
be
reasonably
minimal
nothing
like
chernobyl
hell
i
do
know
the
numbers
president
but
then
again
he
was
over
some
fairly
open
waters
besides
like
i
said
we
had
a
quarantine
on
all
civilian
air
and
sea
traffic
guess
we
see
now
what
a
good
idea
that
was
so
maybe
we
can
be
optimistic
the
bloody
fools
just
committed
and
took
isaac
with
them
he
found
himself
thinking
about
the
warning
his
aged
father
had
given
him
that
the
job
of
president
would
age
him
half
a
lifetime
in
four
years
he
now
felt
it
had
happened
in
two
days
there
more
morton
davies
said
clicking
off
a
third
phone
and
glancing
at
the
computerized
map
now
being
projected
on
the
giant
screen
at
the
end
of
the
room
satcom
rocket
did
go
up
that
all
they
know
for
certain
but
they
think
it
going
into
orbit
whatever
the
hell
that
means
what
about
the
deltas
hansen
asked
finally
remembering
all
the
planning
and
the
assault
did
they
right
good
question
he
beamed
jsoc
command
reports
that
the
deltas
are
on
the
island
now
and
have
it
secured
they
even
retrieved
the
bomb
that
those
bastards
were
planning
to
put
on
satcom
rocket
they
managed
to
get
it
removed
before
the
launch
how
i
have
heard
yet
but
at
least
we
can
take
pride
in
the
fact
that
this
country
antiterrorist
capabilities
got
a
rehearsal
and
they
were
up
to
the
job
the
president
nodded
gravely
not
quite
sure
what
exactly
had
been
proved
that
america
could
go
in
with
too
little
too
late
if
so
it
was
sobering
insight
all
right
morton
get
caroline
in
here
first
thing
in
the
morning
i
want
her
to
schedule
a
television
speech
for
tomorrow
night
time
i
do
know
what
i
say
other
than
our
special
forces
minimized
the
loss
of
life
it
going
to
sound
pretty
lame
and
what
about
the
money
is
that
going
to
get
mentioned
hansen
laughed
not
in
a
million
years
that
money
going
to
be
traced
and
retrieved
today
or
else
the
swiss
know
when
to
play
ball
and
by
the
way
nobody
here
knows
anything
about
any
of
this
no
leaks
or
briefings
and
i
mean
that
the
less
said
the
better
that
might
apply
to
the
whole
episode
if
you
want
my
opinion
davies
observed
you
know
morton
yes
and
no
he
turned
thoughtful
maybe
some
good
can
come
of
this
disaster
after
all
it
might
just
be
the
demonstration
we
all
needed
to
start
the
process
of
putting
this
nuclear
madness
to
rest
once
and
for
all
the
genie
managed
to
slip
out
of
the
bottle
for
a
couple
of
days
and
now
we
see
how
it
can
happen
i
think
it
time
we
got
serious
about
total
disarmament
and
inspection
edward
briggs
always
knew
hansen
was
a
dreamer
but
this
time
he
was
going
too
far
he
did
not
like
the
idea
of
america
scrapping
its
nuclear
arsenal
even
if
everybody
else
did
the
same
that
going
to
mean
a
lot
of
wheeling
and
dealing
president
it
going
to
be
a
hard
sell
in
some
quarters
right
hansen
thought
and
the
hardest
sell
of
all
was
going
to
be
the
pentagon
well
dammit
nothing
in
this
world
is
easy
but
this
is
one
move
toward
sanity
that
may
have
just
gotten
easier
thanks
to
that
idiot
on
the
island
i
going
to
rework
that
speech
i
got
scheduled
for
the
general
assembly
we
lined
up
the
security
council
including
the
permanent
members
for
the
right
reasons
once
before
i
going
to
see
if
we
ca
do
it
again
this
time
i
think
we
got
an
even
better
reason
all
right
we
can
evacuate
them
on
a
huey
eric
nichols
was
saying
they
take
care
of
them
on
the
kennedy
courtesy
of
the
government
but
just
who
the
hell
are
you
he
was
in
the
upper
level
of
the
satcom
living
quarters
talking
to
a
man
in
a
black
pullover
who
was
packing
a
pile
of
greek
balaclavas
into
a
crate
what
in
blazes
had
gone
on
he
had
arrived
in
the
lead
huey
to
find
one
of
the
apaches
only
one
satcom
space
vehicle
left
and
the
deltas
on
the
ground
futilely
searching
for
terrorists
but
instead
of
terrorists
they
had
only
come
across
this
group
of
men
in
black
pullovers
who
had
surrendered
en
masse
turned
out
they
were
friendlies
and
now
this
guy
had
just
asked
for
a
huey
to
take
out
a
couple
of
their
ranks
who
had
been
shot
up
one
pretty
badly
my
name
is
pierre
armont
replied
the
man
he
seemed
to
be
the
one
in
charge
and
he
had
a
french
accent
i
mean
who
the
hell
and
all
these
guys
cia
nichols
could
figure
any
of
it
two
minutes
after
he
landed
a
shock
wave
pounded
the
island
then
when
he
tried
to
radio
the
kennedy
to
find
out
what
in
good
christ
had
happened
he
could
get
through
there
was
no
radio
traffic
anywhere
he
had
a
sinking
feeling
he
knew
what
that
meant
and
now
these
clowns
they
did
look
like
regular
military
but
there
was
something
about
the
way
they
moved
we
civilians
armont
said
cryptically
and
we
not
here
you
do
see
us
hell
i
do
what
in
blazes
do
you
mean
nichols
did
like
wiseacres
who
played
games
the
problem
was
these
guys
clearly
desk
jockeys
the
one
type
he
really
despised
no
they
seemed
more
like
a
private
antiterrorist
unit
and
he
did
have
a
emotion
for
that
as
far
as
you
and
the
government
are
concerned
we
do
exist
armont
continued
it
better
if
we
keep
things
that
way
nichols
looked
around
and
examined
their
gear
trying
to
figure
it
the
stuff
was
from
all
over
the
place
german
british
french
greek
even
and
not
only
was
it
from
all
over
the
globe
it
was
all
top
notch
much
of
it
supposedly
not
available
to
civilians
where
and
then
it
hit
you
the
jokers
we
were
trying
to
keep
from
coming
in
you
did
a
pretty
good
job
of
slowing
us
down
armont
nodded
not
good
enough
it
would
seem
he
laughed
a
mirthless
grunt
you
a
crafty
bunch
of
fuckers
i
grant
you
one
thing
though
at
least
you
knew
enough
not
to
put
up
with
micromanaging
from
the
other
side
of
the
globe
you
ended
up
doing
exactly
what
we
would
have
if
anybody
had
let
us
vietnam
all
over
again
he
was
reaching
into
his
pocket
for
a
montecristo
he
pulled
out
two
care
to
join
me
castro
may
not
be
able
to
run
a
country
for
shit
but
he
can
still
make
a
cigar
thank
you
armont
said
taking
it
he
hated
cigars
by
the
way
i
eric
nichols
i
know
armont
said
jsoc
he
had
followed
nichols
career
for
years
always
with
an
idea
in
the
back
of
his
mind
i
also
know
got
one
more
year
till
retirement
but
you
do
seem
like
the
retiring
type
nichols
stared
over
the
lighted
match
he
was
holding
out
and
smiled
tell
me
about
it
then
he
looked
around
at
the
men
of
arm
the
pile
of
balaclavas
and
vests
of
grenades
and
discipline
plenty
of
discipline
it
was
a
sight
that
did
his
heart
good
your
boys
look
like
they
been
around
in
a
manner
of
speaking
whereupon
pierre
armont
proceeded
to
give
major
general
eric
nichols
an
overview
of
the
private
club
known
as
the
association
of
retired
mercenaries
including
the
financial
dimension
nichols
nodded
slowly
taking
deep
thoughtful
puffs
on
his
montecristo
he
was
already
way
ahead
of
the
conversation
i
think
we
might
need
to
have
a
talk
when
all
this
is
over
a
look
into
the
future
it
would
be
my
pleasure
armont
said
dinner
in
paris
perhaps
i
know
the
perfect
restaurant
he
did
les
ambassadeurs
in
the
hotel
crillon
french
though
not
too
french
americans
like
nichols
always
got
slightly
uneasy
when
there
was
more
than
one
fork
on
the
table
and
the
salad
came
last
sounds
good
to
me
nichols
said
just
as
long
as
i
wo
be
getting
any
asshole
phone
calls
from
the
pentagon
while
we
talk
i
can
virtually
guarantee
it
armont
replied
but
in
the
meantime
we
do
need
a
favor
or
two
from
you
for
starters
we
would
much
prefer
to
just
be
numbered
among
the
civilians
here
he
smiled
that
is
after
all
what
we
are
civilians
with
toys
and
some
pretty
ones
at
that
nichols
said
looking
around
again
but
i
sometimes
have
problems
with
my
vision
always
be
sure
what
i
seeing
like
right
now
for
instance
i
seem
to
see
a
damned
thing
oh
and
one
other
favor
armont
continued
nodding
in
silent
appreciation
we
took
one
of
the
terrorists
alive
a
certain
moreau
who
is
wanted
in
a
string
of
bank
robberies
all
over
france
it
action
directe
idea
of
we
like
to
remove
him
back
to
paris
there
some
parties
there
who
will
pony
up
enough
bounty
to
cover
the
costs
of
this
operation
and
make
us
whole
how
about
it
for
purposes
of
your
mission
debriefing
can
you
just
say
the
precise
number
of
hostiles
remains
to
be
fully
established
when
we
get
back
to
paris
he
going
to
fall
out
of
a
bus
on
the
rue
de
rivoli
and
be
captured
he
paused
hoping
the
americans
might
not
go
for
this
one
we
would
be
particularly
grateful
and
so
would
several
financial
institutions
i
could
name
nichols
drew
again
on
his
cuban
cigar
starting
to
like
this
frog
a
lot
why
the
hell
not
if
you
not
here
then
i
ca
very
well
know
take
out
can
i
never
heard
of
the
guy
thank
you
very
much
armont
said
and
he
meant
it
this
was
indeed
a
man
he
could
work
with
i
glad
we
see
the
situation
eye
to
eye
somebody
at
least
ought
to
come
out
of
this
whole
nichols
reflected
wistfully
jesus
what
a
disaster
armont
had
turned
to
watch
as
the
deltas
began
easing
dimitri
onto
a
metal
stretcher
he
seemed
alert
and
he
even
tried
to
lift
a
hand
and
wave
armont
waved
back
and
shouted
for
him
to
take
it
easy
by
the
way
that
greek
civilian
over
there
is
named
spiros
he
runs
a
security
business
out
of
athens
and
never
leaves
town
which
is
why
he
here
got
it
nichols
nodded
guess
a
lot
of
things
did
happen
today
he
looked
around
but
i
still
got
one
question
we
already
counted
about
half
a
dozen
dead
hostiles
so
if
nobody
was
here
then
who
exactly
took
down
all
these
terrorist
motherfuckers
well
armont
explained
we
both
know
delta
force
does
exist
either
so
maybe
this
greek
sunshine
gave
them
terminal
heatstroke
and
they
all
just
shot
themselves
yeah
nichols
concurred
with
a
smile
damnedest
thing
georges
what
do
you
think
cally
asked
can
it
be
saved
well
first
the
good
news
the
fujitsu
is
okay
he
wheeled
around
from
the
workstation
command
was
a
shambles
but
he
had
managed
to
find
one
auxiliary
terminal
that
would
still
function
that
workstation
and
the
lights
were
on
but
not
much
else
it
was
buried
deep
enough
in
the
bedrock
that
it
escaped
the
emp
the
electromagnetic
pulse
from
the
blast
if
we
lost
our
sweetheart
we
be
dead
in
the
water
any
telemetry
yep
he
smiled
the
tapes
were
on
we
had
doppler
almost
from
liftoff
the
cyclops
computed
our
acceleration
from
it
and
the
results
look
to
be
right
on
the
money
the
news
is
that
the
last
telemetry
we
recorded
just
before
the
bomb
went
off
and
the
cyclops
crashed
showed
that
was
about
three
minutes
away
from
capturing
orbit
i
think
we
probably
made
it
but
i
still
ca
say
however
since
big
benny
was
already
reducing
power
getting
ready
to
shut
it
off
anyway
maybe
just
maybe
we
got
lucky
she
sighed
when
will
you
know
for
sure
right
now
i
trying
to
get
arlington
and
tied
into
here
hoping
we
can
patch
into
their
satellite
receiving
station
anyway
i
should
know
in
a
few
minutes
assuming
the
vehicle
is
still
sending
back
telemetry
care
to
venture
a
guess
she
collapsed
into
a
chair
next
to
him
this
was
the
first
time
she
had
been
in
command
for
several
hours
and
it
seemed
almost
strange
whereas
the
staff
over
at
launch
control
had
opened
the
champagne
immediately
after
still
not
fully
aware
of
all
the
drama
the
command
technicians
were
too
to
think
and
they
were
only
now
slowly
drifting
back
in
not
the
people
in
launch
though
all
they
knew
for
sure
was
that
they
had
done
their
job
even
if
the
gantry
had
collapsed
for
some
mysterious
reason
left
the
pad
without
a
hitch
they
had
a
success
well
if
i
had
to
lay
odds
georges
went
on
i
guess
we
captured
orbit
but
it
going
to
be
erratic
however
if
we
can
get
the
cyclops
up
and
running
again
maybe
we
can
do
a
midcourse
correction
he
tapped
something
on
the
keyboard
yet
another
first
for
the
die
satcom
team
she
had
to
laugh
you
look
pretty
cool
soho
for
somebody
who
just
lived
through
world
war
three
he
tried
unsuccessfully
to
smile
hey
do
go
by
appearances
i
tried
to
open
a
pepsi
just
now
and
my
hands
were
shaking
so
badly
i
finally
just
gave
up
and
went
to
the
water
fountain
cally
i
a
wreck
i
still
quivering
god
he
pulled
at
his
beard
then
absently
added
i
going
to
shave
this
off
what
do
you
think
it
is
me
it
never
was
she
had
refrained
from
telling
him
that
earlier
but
now
he
seemed
to
want
to
talk
about
trivia
maybe
just
to
take
his
mind
off
all
the
heaviness
around
and
there
were
two
new
things
she
did
not
want
to
tell
him
the
first
was
that
millions
of
dollars
were
riding
on
his
every
keystroke
the
second
was
that
she
was
thinking
a
lot
right
now
about
somebody
else
mike
i
ca
believe
it
bates
said
hanging
up
the
phone
the
one
in
his
office
was
among
the
few
still
working
and
it
had
been
ringing
off
the
wall
know
who
that
was
vance
had
not
been
paying
attention
he
had
been
thinking
about
the
woman
out
there
now
talking
to
the
computer
hacker
with
the
scraggly
beard
what
sorry
bill
i
was
listening
hey
he
laughed
your
mental
condition
is
what
it
might
be
tell
you
the
truth
you
look
like
a
guy
who
just
mixed
it
with
a
horsepower
fan
and
lost
you
really
ought
to
go
over
to
medical
and
get
your
face
looked
after
the
deltas
are
probably
still
over
there
if
i
showed
up
i
might
just
get
arrested
do
think
i
could
handle
an
interrogation
right
now
better
to
hide
out
for
a
while
longer
the
fact
was
he
still
felt
too
disoriented
to
think
about
how
he
must
look
he
hurt
all
over
and
he
almost
did
care
whatever
you
say
bates
shrugged
anyway
that
guy
on
the
phone
just
now
was
a
jap
by
the
name
of
matsugami
he
just
happens
to
run
nasda
what
that
vance
asked
trying
to
clear
his
mind
enough
to
remember
the
initials
the
information
was
back
there
somewhere
but
he
just
could
reach
it
you
really
are
out
of
it
buddy
you
of
all
people
ought
to
know
perfectly
well
it
their
national
space
development
agency
he
says
they
disgusted
with
all
the
failures
they
been
having
with
the
american
and
european
commercial
rockets
he
wants
to
talk
about
a
contract
for
satcom
to
put
up
their
next
three
broadcast
satellites
that
means
we
get
to
haggle
for
six
months
while
they
try
to
trim
my
foreskin
but
i
think
we
get
the
job
laser
propulsion
is
suddenly
the
hottest
thing
since
condoms
that
bastard
who
took
us
over
just
gave
us
a
billion
dollars
of
publicity
he
laughed
i
almost
like
to
kiss
what
left
of
his
ass
except
it
probably
somewhere
in
the
ozone
about
now
well
congratulations
wait
till
cally
hears
about
this
she
just
may
go
into
orbit
herself
you
been
on
the
phone
for
an
hour
after
peretz
was
carried
out
he
had
collapsed
onto
the
couch
in
bates
office
and
tried
to
go
to
sleep
but
the
had
made
it
impossible
bates
had
been
talking
nonstop
what
else
is
happening
out
there
in
the
world
ramirez
was
planning
to
nuke
he
did
nuke
it
he
just
did
manage
to
nuke
it
the
place
he
intended
bates
leaned
back
in
his
chair
well
it
turns
out
good
news
travels
fast
since
is
up
our
two
prime
banks
in
geneva
are
suddenly
engaged
in
intimate
contact
between
their
lips
and
my
nether
parts
over
your
obligations
oui
monsieur
bates
certainement
avec
plaisir
you
need
any
additional
capitalization
we
could
discuss
an
equity
position
the
cocksuckers
it
was
almost
a
shame
to
piss
away
that
weapon
on
empty
space
i
could
have
thought
of
a
much
better
use
hallelujah
he
felt
his
spirits
momentarily
rise
though
not
his
energy
maybe
this
means
all
that
stock
you
paid
me
for
the
boat
will
end
up
being
worth
the
paper
it
printed
on
truthfully
i
was
beginning
to
worry
told
you
it
all
work
out
he
grinned
no
faith
come
on
amigo
i
got
to
break
the
news
to
the
troops
he
strode
to
the
door
or
the
opening
that
was
left
after
the
had
removed
the
door
and
surveyed
the
remains
of
command
the
technicians
and
systems
analysts
were
filing
back
in
but
mostly
it
was
a
scene
of
purposeful
lethargy
the
horror
of
the
last
day
and
a
half
had
taken
a
terrible
toll
eyes
were
vacant
hair
unkempt
motions
slow
and
aimless
several
of
those
who
had
previously
quit
smoking
were
bumming
cigarettes
he
whistled
with
two
fingers
and
the
desultory
turmoil
froze
in
place
okay
everybody
he
said
his
voice
not
quite
a
shout
official
we
back
in
business
you
all
still
got
a
job
the
stares
he
received
back
suggested
nobody
thoughts
had
extended
that
far
yet
nobody
was
in
a
particular
mood
to
let
themselves
think
about
the
future
that
the
good
part
bates
went
on
oblivious
the
other
news
is
there
wo
be
bonuses
or
stock
dividends
this
year
we
be
lucky
just
to
service
our
debt
but
anybody
who
hangs
in
there
for
twelve
months
gets
half
a
year
pay
extra
as
a
bonus
i
do
it
out
of
my
own
pocket
if
i
have
to
and
if
you
play
your
cards
right
we
could
be
talking
stock
options
too
there
were
a
few
smiles
and
signs
more
to
hearten
bates
whom
they
revered
than
to
celebrate
nobody
had
the
capacity
left
to
feel
particularly
festive
at
the
same
time
nobody
was
about
to
abandon
ship
not
now
now
that
they
were
needed
more
than
ever
vance
was
leaning
on
the
wall
behind
him
watching
it
all
and
thinking
okay
so
bill
was
about
to
be
rich
and
satcom
had
gotten
enough
free
publicity
to
last
into
the
next
century
but
the
real
notoriety
should
be
going
to
the
question
that
had
haunted
the
world
for
four
decades
what
would
happen
if
terrorists
got
their
hands
on
a
nuclear
device
this
time
the
consequences
although
intended
to
be
devastating
had
in
fact
been
peripheral
an
inconsequential
detonation
somewhere
halfway
into
space
but
the
question
that
still
hung
over
the
world
was
what
would
happen
the
next
time
it
was
a
question
bill
bates
had
too
much
on
his
mind
today
to
think
about
maybe
he
never
would
shook
his
head
in
disgust
as
he
looked
over
the
shambles
that
was
the
gantry
andros
had
just
phoned
from
command
asked
him
to
undertake
a
preliminary
assessment
of
the
condition
of
the
facility
just
to
ballpark
the
extent
of
damage
the
assignment
was
already
depressing
him
still
from
what
he
could
see
so
far
things
could
have
been
worse
there
was
no
obvious
physical
injury
to
or
to
the
transmission
antennas
up
on
the
hill
though
the
testing
and
corrections
could
take
weeks
the
gantry
was
a
total
loss
no
doubt
about
that
but
otherwise
the
major
physical
structures
on
the
island
appeared
unscathed
the
main
reason
naturally
was
that
almost
everything
important
including
the
superconducting
coil
and
the
fujitsu
was
well
underground
the
main
scene
now
was
all
the
bodacious
helicopters
hueys
on
the
landing
pad
and
all
the
army
commandos
milling
around
jesus
how
did
everybody
in
launch
control
miss
what
was
really
going
on
looking
back
the
whole
thing
was
fishy
from
the
word
go
now
the
army
types
were
collecting
the
bodies
of
the
terrorists
and
acting
like
they
had
cleaned
up
the
place
all
by
themselves
guess
that
was
going
to
be
the
official
story
bates
had
already
come
down
to
launch
shook
everybody
hand
and
thanked
the
crews
for
hanging
in
there
he
looked
a
little
shook
up
but
he
was
talking
like
it
totally
upbeat
you
had
to
love
the
guy
he
also
delivered
the
news
that
as
soon
as
things
settled
down
satcom
was
going
to
kick
some
ass
in
the
space
business
jordan
jaegar
looked
up
at
the
brilliant
greek
sunshine
and
grinned
in
spite
of
himself
shit
he
could
wait
it
all
been
handled
armont
was
saying
vance
had
finally
decided
to
venture
out
of
bates
office
and
see
how
things
were
going
the
bates
motel
had
taken
some
heavy
gunfire
around
the
entrance
but
it
was
still
usable
with
the
arm
team
milling
around
and
readying
to
depart
down
below
the
sea
had
never
looked
bluer
nobody
knows
anything
our
favorite
state
of
affairs
vance
was
still
trying
to
take
it
all
in
how
spiros
doing
they
took
him
out
on
one
of
the
hueys
armont
said
hugo
went
too
are
they
going
to
be
all
right
hugo
okay
he
even
knocked
back
a
couple
of
guinnesses
before
he
left
saying
they
would
help
ease
the
stabbing
pain
can
you
believe
as
for
dimitri
the
deltas
had
a
medic
along
and
he
gave
him
a
better
than
shot
said
nothing
vital
seemed
beyond
repair
thank
goodness
for
that
at
least
poor
guy
he
felt
personally
responsible
for
the
whole
mess
i
think
that
was
why
he
sort
of
lost
his
better
judgment
there
for
a
second
when
we
rushed
command
and
got
careless
it
can
happen
vance
said
looking
back
he
decided
he
had
lost
sight
of
better
judgment
several
times
over
the
past
few
hours
the
rest
of
the
arm
team
was
checking
out
the
gear
and
tying
crates
all
the
while
working
on
their
second
case
of
beer
departure
was
imminent
well
vance
added
finally
it
was
a
nightmare
start
to
finish
what
more
can
you
say
well
not
entirely
armont
observed
a
hint
of
satisfaction
creeping
into
his
voice
bates
is
going
to
let
us
use
the
agusta
to
fly
back
to
paris
and
when
we
get
there
one
of
the
terrorists
who
got
blown
up
is
going
to
suddenly
reappear
moreau
know
him
well
vance
said
remembering
the
beating
and
his
sense
of
hopelessness
at
the
time
better
not
let
me
see
the
bastard
he
might
not
make
it
back
to
paris
in
one
piece
well
michael
that
would
be
very
he
worth
a
small
fortune
if
the
greeks
were
to
get
hold
of
him
he
could
piss
on
the
court
system
here
and
keep
it
mucked
up
for
years
so
we
taking
him
straight
back
to
paris
he
paused
to
glance
around
nichols
is
giving
us
an
apache
escort
as
far
as
international
airspace
will
permit
but
you
do
know
anything
about
any
of
this
keep
your
nose
clean
nichols
the
name
did
mean
anything
but
then
his
mind
was
still
mostly
in
neutral
major
general
eric
nichols
no
reason
you
should
know
him
runs
the
deltas
good
man
by
the
way
first
rate
i
had
my
eye
on
him
for
a
number
of
years
could
be
he
end
up
being
our
first
yank
well
our
second
besides
you
so
this
was
really
a
recruiting
drive
vance
laughed
suddenly
he
was
feeling
almost
giddy
again
this
time
from
the
release
of
all
the
stress
you
take
them
where
you
can
get
them
armont
nodded
then
looked
around
and
whistled
okay
everybody
bring
down
the
agusta
and
start
loading
the
gear
we
gone
he
turned
back
to
vance
how
about
you
coming
no
he
said
almost
not
even
catching
the
question
think
maybe
stick
around
make
sure
bill
is
okay
you
know
unfinished
business
right
armont
laughed
i
think
i
saw
your
business
michael
do
you
think
she
might
be
a
little
young
for
you
starting
to
get
like
me
now
well
working
for
arm
does
help
but
then
you
do
have
a
gift
for
pointing
out
the
obvious
the
way
he
felt
starting
over
looked
tougher
all
the
time
on
the
other
hand
why
not
as
a
romantic
frenchman
i
can
only
wish
you
he
patted
him
on
the
back
what
more
can
i
say
thanks
vance
had
to
smile
armont
was
gallant
to
the
end
and
a
man
who
prided
himself
on
knowing
what
things
mattered
in
life
at
my
age
you
need
all
the
luck
you
can
get
in
this
life
you
make
your
own
luck
with
which
pronouncement
he
shook
hands
then
yelled
for
hans
to
bring
over
the
list
of
gear
for
one
last
inventory
it
was
the
end
of
the
day
and
he
could
genuinely
have
used
a
tequila
double
with
a
big
mexican
lime
on
the
side
instead
however
he
had
something
else
on
the
agenda
after
an
early
dinner
with
bill
bates
he
had
talked
calypso
andros
into
a
stroll
down
to
the
harbor
there
to
meditate
on
the
events
of
the
past
two
days
they
had
agreed
in
advance
not
to
talk
about
isaac
mannheim
death
cally
declared
he
would
have
wanted
it
that
way
his
life
was
his
legacy
i
wonder
if
this
island
will
ever
be
the
same
again
she
was
saying
as
she
leaned
back
against
a
rock
you
know
it
was
peaceful
once
before
satcom
took
over
there
actually
were
sheep
a
whole
herd
but
even
then
it
had
a
kind
of
purposefulness
that
was
just
the
opposite
of
chaos
we
the
ones
who
disrupted
it
satcom
we
remade
it
in
our
image
and
we
tempted
fate
she
sighed
god
this
whole
disaster
almost
seems
like
a
bad
dream
now
i
wonder
if
the
island
will
ever
know
real
peace
again
there
always
be
the
memory
to
haunt
everybody
you
know
when
ulysses
came
back
to
his
island
he
discovered
it
had
been
taken
over
by
a
bunch
of
thugs
so
he
took
away
their
weapons
locked
the
doors
and
straightened
things
out
it
set
a
good
precedent
well
it
did
exactly
happen
that
cleanly
this
time
but
we
did
get
them
all
every
last
one
and
about
half
of
them
you
took
care
of
yourself
one
way
or
another
please
he
stopped
her
let
do
keep
score
it
too
depressing
i
not
depressed
at
least
not
about
them
they
came
in
here
and
murdered
people
right
and
left
they
deserved
whatever
they
got
good
riddance
the
human
race
is
better
off
that
pretty
tough
vance
said
on
the
other
hand
whereas
they
claimed
to
be
terrorists
they
really
were
just
extortionists
at
least
ramirez
and
peretz
were
for
them
this
was
all
about
money
kidnapping
and
ransom
so
maybe
you
right
the
penalty
for
kidnapping
is
death
they
were
looking
at
the
max
no
matter
what
court
ended
up
trying
them
i
say
arm
just
spared
greece
or
somebody
a
lot
of
trouble
and
expense
performed
a
public
service
i
suppose
that
one
way
to
look
at
it
he
smiled
but
somehow
i
do
think
pierre
going
to
get
so
much
as
a
note
it
never
happens
things
always
get
confused
like
this
at
the
end
but
as
long
as
he
and
the
boys
come
out
whole
they
do
care
his
voice
trailed
off
as
he
studied
the
sea
along
the
coast
on
either
side
the
pale
early
moon
glinted
off
the
breakers
that
crashed
in
with
a
relentless
rhythm
yes
a
bomb
had
exploded
somewhere
up
there
in
space
but
the
aegean
even
the
jagged
rocks
around
the
island
still
retained
their
timeless
serenity
the
greek
islands
he
never
wanted
to
leave
right
now
though
he
was
trying
to
work
up
his
nerve
to
talk
seriously
with
cally
andros
and
the
words
were
coming
how
to
start
are
you
still
here
she
finally
broke
his
reverie
or
are
you
just
gazing
off
sorry
about
that
he
clicked
back
i
was
thinking
wondering
if
you
still
be
interested
in
in
what
we
talked
about
yesterday
what
she
looked
puzzled
then
oh
you
mean
taking
a
sail
with
an
old
slightly
operator
you
beat
up
there
no
denying
it
she
laughed
i
hope
you
keep
your
boats
in
better
shape
she
looked
him
over
and
thought
again
how
much
he
reminded
her
of
alan
the
mistake
that
affair
represented
was
not
one
to
be
repeated
blindly
then
again
but
i
do
consider
you
old
experienced
maybe
but
still
functioning
is
that
supposed
to
mean
yes
it
more
like
a
maybe
she
touched
his
hand
what
were
you
thinking
about
exactly
what
else
the
thing
he
looked
out
at
the
horizon
then
back
seems
to
me
it
deserves
another
try
the
pearl
seas
are
yonder
the
shore
if
you
pardon
my
attempt
to
wax
poetic
she
smiled
plagiarist
i
know
that
one
and
i
also
know
another
line
in
it
that
goes
was
a
steepled
city
but
troy
was
far
away
far
away
get
it
or
maybe
it
does
even
really
exist
at
all
oh
it
exists
all
right
you
just
have
to
want
to
find
it
he
picked
up
a
pebble
and
tossed
it
toward
the
surf
now
rapidly
disappearing
in
the
dusk
so
what
are
you
trying
to
say
i
saying
that
maybe
troy
was
a
real
place
and
maybe
not
but
almost
beside
the
point
what
it
really
is
is
a
symbol
for
that
something
or
somebody
we
all
looking
for
whatever
special
it
is
we
each
want
like
when
i
came
here
to
work
for
satcom
space
was
my
troy
it
was
what
i
wanted
and
when
you
tried
to
the
voyage
of
ulysses
you
were
thinking
you
could
make
something
that
was
a
myth
into
something
that
was
real
big
impossibility
you
saying
the
search
for
troy
is
actually
just
an
inner
voyage
and
i
got
caught
up
in
trying
to
make
it
literal
the
boat
and
all
well
that
what
myth
is
really
about
is
it
we
make
up
a
story
using
real
concrete
things
to
symbolize
our
inner
journey
you
saying
ulysses
could
have
sailed
up
a
creek
for
all
it
mattered
exactly
what
i
saying
she
leaned
back
shit
i
want
a
pizza
so
bad
right
now
i
think
i
going
crazy
vance
was
still
pondering
her
of
his
rerun
wondering
if
maybe
she
was
onto
something
maybe
he
had
learned
more
about
himself
in
two
days
on
the
island
than
he
would
have
learned
in
two
years
plying
the
aegean
all
right
she
said
finally
i
sorry
i
busted
your
chops
enough
you
asked
if
i
like
to
take
a
sail
and
i
said
maybe
the
truth
is
i
would
but
i
also
got
a
journey
of
my
own
in
mind
what
do
you
mean
well
before
i
tell
you
maybe
i
better
make
sure
you
meant
it
for
one
thing
what
are
you
going
to
sail
in
good
question
up
until
that
moment
he
had
not
given
much
thought
to
personal
finance
the
truth
was
he
was
broke
i
do
know
if
i
can
scrape
up
enough
money
to
build
an
it
a
problem
well
i
tell
you
what
i
think
i
think
bill
owes
you
at
least
a
boat
for
all
you
did
he
shrugged
not
quite
agreeing
with
her
on
that
point
you
do
pitch
in
to
help
out
an
old
friend
then
turn
around
and
send
him
an
invoice
maybe
maybe
not
but
in
any
case
it
would
be
minus
the
ten
grand
i
owe
him
for
the
bet
i
lost
come
on
she
frowned
that
not
fair
maybe
not
but
a
deal
a
deal
poseidon
was
the
god
of
the
sea
and
the
god
of
anger
this
is
greece
so
maybe
the
old
gods
are
still
around
maybe
i
tempted
poseidon
and
pissed
him
off
anyway
the
sea
got
angry
and
that
how
it
goes
the
way
of
the
gods
ten
big
ones
well
calypso
andros
said
speaking
of
gods
aphrodite
was
the
goddess
of
love
and
beauty
the
greeks
were
smart
enough
to
give
you
a
selection
so
you
ought
to
think
about
burning
some
incense
to
her
next
time
or
something
maybe
fall
in
love
i
hear
she
likes
that
too
good
suggestion
he
glanced
over
michael
i
feel
so
rootless
she
said
finally
leaning
against
him
strands
of
hair
across
his
shoulder
not
close
to
anybody
really
now
that
satcom
does
need
my
mothering
any
more
i
want
to
try
and
start
a
few
things
over
and
the
place
i
want
to
start
is
naxos
he
just
nodded
understanding
i
want
to
go
back
to
my
old
home
she
went
on
almost
a
sad
confession
i
have
been
there
for
over
twenty
years
we
had
such
a
beautiful
little
whitewashed
house
looked
out
on
a
bay
it
was
tiny
but
i
still
sneak
back
there
in
my
dreams
i
want
to
make
sure
it
survived
do
think
you
have
to
worry
the
shock
wave
was
probably
well
dissipated
by
the
time
it
hit
paros
and
naxos
fact
is
i
doubt
it
did
any
real
damage
to
any
of
the
islands
why
do
we
go
there
together
your
and
mine
it
a
done
deal
good
she
straightened
suddenly
becoming
businesslike
just
as
soon
as
we
find
out
about
if
it
made
orbit
and
if
anything
is
salvageable
georges
should
know
by
tomorrow
morning
then
i
want
to
split
for
a
while
it
would
do
us
both
good
have
to
and
you
know
since
definitely
going
to
need
some
transportation
i
think
i
getting
an
idea
he
nodded
down
toward
the
morgan
pristine
white
bobbing
at
anchor
in
the
harbor
looks
pretty
seaworthy
to
me
think
bill
would
mind
with
all
the
satcom
stock
i
got
now
she
reached
out
and
touched
his
face
i
just
fire
him
if
he
says
