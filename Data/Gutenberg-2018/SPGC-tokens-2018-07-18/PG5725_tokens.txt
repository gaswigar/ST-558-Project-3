in
the
listening
time
has
there
ever
been
a
time
when
no
stories
were
told
has
there
ever
been
a
people
who
did
not
care
to
listen
i
think
not
when
we
were
little
before
we
could
read
for
ourselves
did
we
not
gather
eagerly
round
father
or
mother
friend
or
nurse
at
the
promise
of
a
story
when
we
grew
older
what
happy
hours
did
we
not
spend
with
our
books
how
the
printed
words
made
us
forget
the
world
in
which
we
live
and
carried
us
away
to
a
wonderland
where
waters
gushed
and
fruit
trees
grew
and
flowers
put
forth
a
fairer
hue
and
everything
was
strange
and
new
the
sparrows
were
brighter
than
peacocks
here
and
their
dogs
outran
our
fallow
deer
and
honey
bees
had
lost
their
stings
and
horses
were
born
with
eagles
wings
browning
and
as
it
is
with
us
so
it
is
with
a
nation
with
a
people
in
the
dim
times
when
our
forefathers
were
wild
naked
savages
they
had
no
books
like
ourselves
when
we
were
tiny
they
could
neither
read
nor
write
but
do
you
think
that
they
had
no
stories
oh
yes
we
may
be
sure
that
when
the
work
was
done
when
the
fight
or
the
chase
was
over
they
gathered
round
the
wood
fire
and
listened
to
the
tales
of
the
these
stories
were
all
of
war
they
told
of
terrible
combats
with
men
or
with
fierce
strange
beasts
they
told
of
passion
of
revenge
in
them
there
was
no
beauty
no
tenderness
no
love
for
the
life
of
man
in
those
days
was
wild
and
rough
it
was
one
long
struggle
against
foes
a
struggle
which
left
little
room
for
what
was
beautiful
or
tender
but
as
time
went
on
as
life
became
more
easy
in
one
way
or
another
the
savage
learned
to
become
less
savage
then
as
he
changed
the
tales
he
listened
to
changed
too
they
were
no
longer
all
of
war
of
revenge
they
told
of
love
also
and
later
when
the
story
of
christ
had
come
to
soften
men
hearts
and
brighten
men
lives
the
stories
told
of
faith
and
purity
and
gentleness
at
last
a
time
came
when
minstrels
wandered
from
town
to
town
from
castle
to
castle
singing
their
lays
and
the
minstrel
who
had
a
good
tale
to
tell
was
ever
sure
of
a
welcome
and
for
his
pains
he
was
rewarded
with
money
jewels
and
even
land
that
was
the
true
listening
time
of
the
world
it
was
no
easy
thing
to
be
a
minstrel
and
a
man
often
spent
ten
or
twelve
years
in
learning
to
be
one
there
were
certain
tales
which
all
minstrels
had
to
know
and
the
best
among
them
could
tell
three
hundred
and
fifty
of
these
stories
the
minstrels
used
to
learn
only
the
outline
and
each
told
the
story
in
his
own
way
filling
it
in
according
to
his
own
fancy
so
as
time
went
on
these
tales
came
to
be
told
in
many
different
ways
changing
as
the
times
changed
at
length
after
many
years
had
passed
men
began
to
write
down
these
tales
so
that
they
might
not
be
forgotten
these
first
books
we
call
manuscripts
from
the
latin
words
manus
a
hand
and
scribere
to
write
for
they
were
all
written
by
hand
even
after
they
were
written
down
there
were
many
changes
made
in
the
tales
for
those
who
wrote
or
copied
them
would
sometimes
miss
lines
or
alter
others
yet
they
were
less
changed
than
they
had
been
when
told
only
by
word
of
mouth
these
stories
then
form
the
beginnings
of
what
is
called
our
literature
literature
really
means
letters
for
it
comes
from
a
latin
word
littera
meaning
a
letter
of
the
alphabet
words
are
made
by
letters
of
the
alphabet
being
set
together
and
our
literature
again
by
words
being
set
together
hence
the
name
as
on
and
on
time
went
every
year
more
stories
were
told
and
sung
and
written
down
the
first
stories
which
our
forefathers
told
in
the
days
long
long
ago
and
which
were
never
written
down
are
lost
forever
even
many
of
those
stories
which
were
written
are
lost
too
but
a
few
still
remain
and
from
them
we
can
learn
much
of
the
life
and
the
history
of
the
people
who
lived
in
our
land
ten
and
twelve
hundred
years
ago
or
more
for
a
long
time
books
were
all
written
by
hand
they
were
very
scarce
and
dear
and
only
the
wealthy
could
afford
to
have
them
and
few
could
read
them
even
great
knights
and
nobles
could
not
read
for
they
spent
all
their
time
in
fighting
and
hunting
and
had
little
time
in
which
to
learn
so
it
came
about
that
the
monks
who
lived
a
quiet
and
peaceful
life
became
the
learned
men
in
the
monasteries
it
was
that
books
were
written
and
copied
there
too
they
were
kept
and
the
monasteries
became
not
only
the
schools
but
the
libraries
of
the
country
as
a
nation
grows
and
changes
its
literature
grows
and
changes
with
it
at
first
it
asks
only
for
stories
then
it
asks
for
history
for
its
own
sake
and
for
poetry
for
its
own
sake
history
i
mean
for
the
knowledge
it
gives
us
of
the
past
poetry
for
joy
in
the
beautiful
words
and
not
merely
for
the
stories
they
tell
then
as
a
nation
needs
and
knowledge
grow
it
demands
ever
more
and
more
books
on
all
kinds
of
subjects
and
we
ourselves
grow
and
change
just
as
a
nation
does
when
we
are
very
young
there
are
many
books
which
seem
to
us
dull
and
stupid
but
as
we
grow
older
and
learn
more
we
begin
to
like
more
and
more
kinds
of
books
we
may
still
love
the
stories
that
we
loved
as
children
but
we
love
others
too
and
at
last
perhaps
there
comes
a
time
when
those
books
which
seemed
to
us
most
dull
and
stupid
delight
us
the
most
at
first
too
we
care
only
for
the
story
itself
we
do
not
mind
very
much
in
what
words
it
is
told
so
long
as
it
is
a
story
but
later
we
begin
to
care
very
much
indeed
what
words
the
teller
uses
and
how
he
uses
them
it
is
only
perhaps
when
we
have
learned
to
hear
with
our
eyes
that
we
know
the
true
joy
of
books
yes
hear
with
our
eyes
for
it
is
joy
in
the
sound
of
the
words
that
makes
our
breath
come
fast
which
brings
smiles
to
our
lips
or
tears
to
our
eyes
yet
we
do
not
need
to
read
the
words
aloud
the
sight
of
the
black
letters
on
the
white
page
is
enough
in
this
book
i
am
going
to
tell
you
about
a
few
of
our
greatest
and
their
books
many
of
these
books
you
will
not
care
to
read
for
yourselves
for
a
long
time
to
come
you
must
be
content
to
be
told
about
them
you
must
be
content
to
know
that
there
are
rooms
in
the
fairy
palace
of
our
literature
into
which
you
can
not
enter
yet
but
every
year
as
your
knowledge
grows
you
will
find
that
new
keys
have
been
put
into
your
hands
with
which
you
may
unlock
the
doors
which
are
now
closed
and
with
every
door
that
you
unlock
you
will
become
aware
of
others
and
still
others
that
are
yet
shut
fast
until
at
last
you
learn
with
something
of
pain
that
the
great
palace
of
our
literature
is
so
vast
that
you
can
never
hope
to
open
all
the
doors
even
to
peep
inside
chapter
ii
the
story
of
the
cattle
raid
of
cooley
our
earliest
literature
was
history
and
poetry
indeed
we
might
say
poetry
only
for
in
those
times
history
was
always
poetry
it
being
only
through
the
songs
of
the
bards
and
minstrels
that
history
was
known
and
when
i
say
history
i
do
not
mean
history
as
we
know
it
it
was
then
merely
the
gallant
tale
of
some
hero
deeds
listened
to
because
it
was
a
gallant
tale
now
the
people
who
lived
in
the
british
isles
long
ago
were
not
english
it
will
be
simplest
for
us
to
call
them
all
celts
and
to
divide
them
into
two
families
the
gaels
and
the
cymry
the
gaels
lived
in
ireland
and
in
scotland
and
the
cymry
in
england
and
wales
it
is
to
ireland
that
we
must
go
for
the
very
beginnings
of
our
literature
for
the
roman
conquest
did
not
touch
ireland
and
the
english
who
later
conquered
and
took
possession
of
britain
hardly
troubled
the
green
isle
so
for
centuries
the
gaels
of
ireland
told
their
tales
and
handed
them
on
from
father
to
son
undisturbed
and
in
ireland
a
great
many
old
writings
have
been
kept
which
tell
of
times
these
old
irish
manuscripts
are
perhaps
none
of
them
older
than
the
eleventh
century
but
the
stories
are
far
far
older
they
were
we
may
believe
passed
on
by
word
of
mouth
for
many
generations
before
they
were
written
down
and
they
have
kept
the
feeling
of
those
times
it
was
from
ireland
that
the
scots
came
to
scotland
and
when
they
came
they
brought
with
them
many
tales
so
it
comes
about
that
in
old
scottish
and
in
old
irish
manuscripts
we
find
the
same
stories
many
of
the
manuscripts
which
are
kept
in
ireland
have
never
been
translated
out
of
the
old
irish
in
which
they
were
written
so
they
are
closed
books
to
all
but
a
few
scholars
and
we
need
not
talk
about
them
but
of
one
of
the
great
treasures
of
old
irish
literature
we
will
talk
this
is
the
leabhar
na
or
book
of
the
dun
cow
it
is
called
so
because
the
stories
in
it
were
first
written
down
by
ciaran
in
a
book
made
from
the
skin
of
a
favorite
cow
of
a
dun
color
that
book
has
long
been
lost
and
this
copy
of
it
was
made
in
the
eleventh
century
the
name
of
this
old
book
helps
us
to
remember
that
long
ago
there
was
no
paper
and
that
books
were
written
on
vellum
made
from
and
upon
parchment
made
from
it
was
not
until
the
twelfth
century
that
paper
began
to
be
made
in
some
parts
of
europe
and
it
was
not
until
the
fifteenth
century
that
paper
books
became
common
in
england
in
the
book
of
the
dun
cow
and
in
another
old
book
called
the
book
of
leinster
there
is
written
the
great
irish
legend
called
the
tain
bo
chuailgne
or
the
cattle
raid
of
cooley
this
is
a
very
old
tale
of
the
time
soon
after
the
birth
of
christ
in
the
book
we
are
told
how
this
story
had
been
written
down
long
long
ago
in
a
book
called
the
great
book
written
on
skins
but
a
learned
man
carried
away
that
book
to
the
east
then
when
many
years
had
passed
people
began
to
forget
the
story
of
the
cattle
raid
so
the
chief
minstrel
called
all
the
other
minstrels
together
to
ask
if
any
of
them
knew
the
tale
but
none
of
them
could
remember
more
than
a
few
verses
of
it
therefore
the
chief
minstrel
asked
all
his
pupils
to
travel
into
far
countries
to
search
for
the
rest
which
was
lost
what
followed
is
told
differently
in
different
books
but
all
agree
in
this
that
a
great
chief
called
fergus
came
back
from
the
dead
in
order
to
tell
the
tale
which
was
again
written
down
the
story
is
one
of
the
beautiful
queen
meav
of
connaught
for
many
years
she
had
lived
happily
with
her
husband
and
her
children
but
one
day
the
queen
and
her
husband
began
to
argue
as
to
which
of
them
was
the
richer
as
they
could
not
agree
they
ordered
all
their
treasures
to
be
brought
before
them
that
they
might
be
compared
so
first
all
their
wooden
and
metal
vessels
were
brought
but
they
were
both
alike
then
all
their
jewels
their
rings
and
bracelets
necklets
and
crowns
were
brought
but
they
too
were
equal
then
all
their
robes
were
brought
crimson
and
blue
green
yellow
checked
and
striped
black
and
white
they
too
were
equal
next
from
the
fields
and
pastures
great
herds
of
sheep
were
brought
they
too
were
equal
then
from
the
green
plains
fleet
horses
champing
steeds
came
great
herds
of
swine
from
forest
and
glen
were
brought
they
too
were
equal
lastly
droves
and
droves
of
cattle
were
brought
in
the
herd
there
was
a
young
bull
named
when
a
calf
he
had
belonged
to
meav
herd
but
being
very
proud
and
thinking
it
little
honor
to
be
under
the
rule
of
a
woman
he
had
left
meav
herd
and
joined
himself
to
the
king
this
bull
was
very
beautiful
his
head
and
horns
and
hoofs
were
white
and
all
the
rest
of
him
was
red
he
was
so
great
and
splendid
that
in
all
the
queen
herd
there
was
none
to
match
him
then
meav
sorrow
was
bitter
and
calling
a
messenger
she
asked
if
he
knew
where
might
be
found
a
young
bull
to
match
with
horned
the
messenger
replied
that
he
knew
of
a
much
finer
bull
called
donn
chuailgne
or
brown
bull
of
cooley
which
belonged
to
dawra
the
chief
of
ulster
go
then
said
meav
and
ask
dawra
to
lend
me
the
bull
for
a
year
tell
him
that
he
shall
be
well
repaid
that
he
shall
receive
fifty
heifers
and
brown
bull
back
again
at
the
end
of
that
time
and
if
dawra
should
seem
unwilling
to
lend
brown
bull
tell
him
that
he
may
come
with
it
himself
and
that
he
shall
receive
here
land
equal
to
his
own
a
chariot
worth
six
cows
and
he
shall
have
my
friendship
ever
after
so
taking
with
him
nine
others
the
messenger
set
out
and
soon
arrived
at
cooley
and
when
dawra
heard
why
the
messengers
had
come
he
received
them
kindly
and
said
at
once
that
they
should
have
brown
bull
then
the
messengers
began
to
speak
and
boast
among
themselves
it
was
well
said
one
that
dawra
granted
us
the
bull
willingly
otherwise
we
had
taken
it
by
force
as
he
spoke
a
servant
of
dawra
came
with
food
and
drink
for
the
strangers
and
hearing
how
they
spoke
among
themselves
he
hastily
and
in
wrath
dashed
the
food
upon
the
table
and
returning
to
his
master
repeated
to
him
the
words
of
the
messenger
then
was
dawra
very
wrathful
and
when
in
the
morning
the
messengers
came
before
him
asking
that
he
should
fulfill
his
promise
he
refused
them
so
the
messengers
returned
to
queen
meav
and
she
full
of
anger
decided
to
make
good
the
boastful
words
of
her
messenger
and
take
brown
bull
by
force
then
began
a
mighty
war
between
the
men
of
ulster
and
the
men
of
connaught
and
after
many
fights
there
was
a
great
battle
in
which
meav
was
defeated
yet
was
she
triumphant
for
she
had
gained
possession
of
the
brown
bull
but
the
queen
had
little
cause
for
triumph
for
when
brown
bull
and
met
there
was
a
fearful
combat
between
them
the
whole
land
echoed
with
their
bellowing
the
earth
shook
beneath
their
feet
and
the
sky
grew
dark
with
flying
sods
of
earth
and
with
flecks
of
foam
after
long
fighting
brown
bull
conquered
and
goring
to
death
ran
off
with
him
impaled
upon
his
horns
shaking
his
shattered
body
to
pieces
as
he
ran
but
brown
bull
too
was
wounded
to
death
mad
with
pain
and
wounds
he
turned
to
his
own
land
and
there
he
lay
down
against
the
hill
and
his
great
heart
broke
there
and
sent
a
stream
of
blood
down
all
the
slope
and
thus
when
all
the
war
and
tain
had
ended
in
his
own
land
his
own
hills
he
died
tain
by
mary
hutton
the
cattle
raid
of
cooley
is
a
strange
wild
tale
yet
from
it
we
can
learn
a
great
deal
about
the
life
of
these
old
times
we
can
learn
from
it
something
of
what
the
people
did
and
thought
and
how
they
lived
and
even
of
what
they
wore
here
is
a
description
of
a
driver
and
his
war
chariot
translated
of
course
into
english
prose
it
is
then
that
the
charioteer
arose
and
he
put
on
his
hero
dress
of
charioteering
this
was
the
hero
dress
of
charioteering
that
he
put
on
his
soft
tunic
of
deer
skin
so
that
it
did
not
restrain
the
movement
of
his
hands
outside
he
put
on
his
black
upper
cloak
over
it
outside
the
charioteer
took
first
then
his
helm
ridged
like
a
board
this
was
well
measured
to
him
and
it
was
not
an
over
weight
his
hand
brought
the
circlet
of
yellow
as
though
it
were
a
plate
of
red
gold
of
refined
gold
smelted
over
the
edge
of
the
anvil
to
his
brow
as
a
sign
of
his
charioteering
as
a
distinction
to
his
master
he
took
the
goads
to
his
horses
and
his
whip
inlaid
in
his
right
hand
he
took
the
reins
to
hold
back
his
horses
in
his
left
hand
then
he
put
the
iron
inlaid
on
his
horses
so
that
they
were
covered
from
forehead
to
with
spears
and
points
and
lances
and
hard
points
so
that
every
motion
in
this
chariot
was
so
that
every
corner
and
every
point
and
every
end
and
every
front
of
this
chariot
was
a
way
of
tearing
cattle
raid
of
cualnge
by
faraday
we
can
almost
see
that
wild
charioteer
and
his
horses
sheathed
in
bristling
armor
with
every
front
a
way
of
tearing
as
they
dash
amid
the
foe
and
all
through
we
come
on
lines
like
these
full
of
color
and
detail
which
tell
us
of
the
life
of
those
folk
of
long
ago
chapter
iii
one
of
the
sorrows
of
the
tain
gives
us
vivid
pictures
of
people
and
things
but
it
is
not
full
of
beauty
and
of
tender
imagination
like
many
of
the
gaelic
stories
among
the
most
beautiful
and
best
known
of
these
are
perhaps
the
three
sorrows
of
these
three
stories
are
called
the
tragedy
of
the
children
of
lir
the
tragedy
of
the
children
of
tuireann
and
deirdre
and
the
sons
of
usnach
of
the
three
the
last
is
perhaps
the
most
interesting
because
the
story
happened
partly
in
scotland
and
partly
in
ireland
and
it
is
found
both
in
old
irish
and
in
old
scottish
manuscripts
the
story
is
told
in
many
old
books
and
in
many
ways
both
in
prose
and
in
verse
the
oldest
and
shortest
version
is
in
the
book
of
leinster
the
same
book
in
which
is
found
the
tain
the
tale
goes
that
one
day
king
conor
and
his
nobles
feasted
at
the
house
of
felim
his
chief
and
while
they
feasted
a
daughter
was
born
to
felim
the
then
cathbad
the
druid
who
was
also
at
the
feast
became
exceeding
sad
he
foretold
that
great
sorrow
and
evil
should
come
upon
the
land
because
of
this
child
and
so
he
called
her
deirdre
which
means
trouble
or
alarm
when
the
nobles
heard
that
they
wished
to
slay
the
babe
but
conor
spoke
let
it
not
be
so
done
he
said
it
were
an
ill
thing
to
shed
the
blood
of
an
innocent
child
i
myself
shall
care
for
her
she
shall
be
housed
in
a
safe
place
so
that
none
may
come
nigh
to
her
and
when
she
is
grown
she
shall
be
my
one
true
wife
so
it
was
done
as
king
conor
said
deirdre
was
placed
in
a
safe
and
lonely
castle
where
she
was
seen
of
none
save
her
tutor
and
her
nurse
lavarcam
there
as
the
years
passed
she
grew
tall
and
fair
as
a
slender
lily
and
more
beautiful
than
the
sunshine
now
when
fourteen
years
had
passed
it
happened
one
snowy
day
that
deirdre
tutor
killed
a
calf
to
provide
food
for
their
little
company
and
as
the
calf
blood
was
spilled
upon
the
snow
a
raven
came
to
drink
of
it
when
deirdre
saw
that
she
sighed
and
said
would
that
i
had
a
husband
whose
hair
was
as
the
color
of
the
raven
his
cheeks
as
blood
and
his
skin
as
snow
there
is
such
a
one
said
lavarcam
he
is
naisi
the
son
of
usnach
after
that
here
was
no
rest
for
deirdre
until
she
had
seen
naisi
and
when
they
met
they
loved
each
other
so
that
naisi
took
her
and
fled
with
her
to
scotland
far
from
conor
the
king
for
they
knew
that
when
the
king
learned
that
fair
deirdre
had
been
stolen
from
him
he
would
be
exceeding
wrathful
there
in
scotland
deirdre
and
naisi
lived
for
many
years
happily
with
them
were
ainle
and
ardan
naisi
two
brothers
who
also
loved
their
sister
deirdre
well
but
conor
never
forgot
his
anger
at
the
escape
of
deirdre
he
longed
still
to
have
her
as
his
queen
and
at
last
he
sent
a
messenger
to
lure
the
fair
lady
and
the
three
brave
brothers
back
to
ireland
naisi
and
deirdre
were
seated
together
one
day
and
between
them
conor
chess
board
they
playing
upon
it
naisi
heard
a
cry
and
said
hear
the
call
of
a
man
of
erin
was
not
the
call
of
a
man
of
erin
says
deirdre
the
call
of
a
man
of
alba
deirdre
knew
the
first
cry
of
fergus
but
she
concealed
it
fergus
uttered
the
second
cry
is
the
cry
of
a
man
of
erin
says
naisi
is
not
indeed
says
deirdre
let
us
play
on
fergus
sent
forth
the
third
cry
and
the
sons
of
usnach
knew
it
was
fergus
that
sent
for
the
cry
and
naisi
ordered
ardan
to
go
to
meet
fergus
then
deirdre
declared
she
knew
the
first
call
sent
forth
by
fergus
didst
thou
conceal
it
then
my
queen
says
naisi
vision
i
saw
last
night
says
deirdre
that
three
birds
came
unto
us
having
three
sups
of
honey
in
their
beaks
and
that
they
left
them
with
us
and
that
they
took
three
sups
of
our
blood
with
them
determination
hast
thou
of
that
o
princess
says
naisi
is
says
deirdre
fergus
comes
unto
us
with
a
message
of
peace
from
conor
for
more
sweet
is
not
honey
than
the
message
of
peace
of
the
false
man
that
be
says
naisi
is
long
in
the
port
and
go
ardan
to
meet
him
and
bring
him
with
thee
and
when
fergus
came
there
were
kindly
greetings
between
the
friends
who
had
been
long
parted
then
fergus
told
the
three
brothers
that
conor
had
forgiven
them
and
that
he
longed
to
see
them
back
again
in
the
land
of
erin
so
although
the
heart
of
deirdre
was
sad
and
heavy
with
foreboding
of
evil
they
set
sail
for
the
land
of
erin
but
deirdre
looked
behind
her
as
the
shore
faded
from
sight
and
sang
a
mournful
song
o
eastern
land
i
leave
i
loved
you
well
home
of
my
heart
i
love
and
loved
you
well
i
had
left
you
had
not
naisi
left
hyde
and
so
they
fared
on
their
journey
and
came
at
last
to
palace
and
the
story
tells
how
the
boding
sorrow
that
deirdre
felt
fulfilled
itself
and
how
they
were
betrayed
and
how
the
brothers
fought
and
died
and
how
deirdre
mourned
until
her
snapt
and
death
had
overmastered
her
she
fell
into
the
grave
where
naisi
lay
and
slept
there
at
his
side
the
child
of
felim
fell
the
daughter
of
a
hundred
smiles
men
piled
their
grave
and
reared
their
stone
on
high
and
wrote
their
names
in
ogham
so
they
lay
all
four
united
in
the
dream
of
death
ancient
gaelic
writing
douglas
hyde
such
in
a
few
words
is
the
story
of
deirdre
but
you
must
read
the
tale
itself
to
find
out
how
beautiful
it
is
that
you
can
easily
do
for
it
has
been
translated
many
times
out
of
the
old
gaelic
in
which
it
was
first
written
and
it
has
been
told
so
simply
that
even
those
of
you
who
are
quite
young
can
read
it
for
yourselves
in
both
the
tain
and
in
deirdre
we
find
the
love
of
fighting
the
brave
joy
of
the
strong
man
when
he
finds
a
gallant
foe
the
tain
is
such
history
as
those
times
afforded
but
it
is
history
touched
with
fancy
wrought
with
poetry
in
the
three
sorrows
we
have
romance
they
are
what
we
might
call
the
novels
of
the
time
it
is
in
stories
like
these
that
we
find
the
keen
sense
of
what
is
beautiful
in
nature
the
sense
of
brotherhood
with
bird
and
beast
star
and
flower
which
has
become
the
mark
of
celtic
literature
we
can
not
put
it
into
words
perhaps
for
it
is
something
mystic
and
strange
something
that
takes
us
nearer
fairyland
and
makes
us
see
that
land
of
dreams
with
clearer
eyes

chapter
iv
the
story
of
a
literary
lie
who
wrote
the
stories
which
are
found
in
the
old
gaelic
manuscripts
we
do
not
know
yet
the
names
of
some
of
the
old
gaelic
poets
have
come
down
to
us
the
best
known
of
all
is
perhaps
that
of
ossian
but
as
ossian
if
he
ever
lived
lived
in
the
third
century
as
it
is
not
probable
that
his
poems
were
written
down
at
the
time
and
as
the
oldest
books
that
we
have
containing
any
of
his
poetry
were
written
in
the
twelfth
century
it
is
very
difficult
to
be
sure
that
he
really
made
the
poems
called
by
his
name
ossian
was
a
warrior
and
chief
as
well
as
a
poet
and
as
a
poet
he
is
claimed
both
by
scotland
and
by
ireland
but
perhaps
his
name
has
become
more
nearly
linked
to
scotland
because
of
the
story
that
i
am
going
to
tell
you
now
it
belongs
really
to
a
time
much
later
than
that
of
which
we
have
been
speaking
but
because
it
has
to
do
with
this
old
gaelic
poet
ossian
i
think
you
will
like
to
hear
it
now
in
a
lonely
highland
village
more
than
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
there
lived
a
little
boy
called
james
macpherson
his
father
and
mother
were
poor
farmer
people
and
james
ran
about
barefooted
and
wild
among
the
hills
and
glens
when
he
was
about
seven
years
old
the
quiet
of
his
highland
home
was
broken
by
the
sounds
of
war
for
the
highland
folk
had
risen
in
rebellion
against
king
george
and
were
fighting
for
prince
charlie
hoping
to
have
a
stewart
king
once
more
this
was
the
rebellion
called
the
for
it
was
fought
in
now
little
james
watched
the
red
coats
of
the
southern
soldiers
as
with
bayonets
gleaming
in
the
sun
they
wound
through
the
glens
he
heard
the
highland
and
the
clash
of
steel
on
steel
for
fighting
came
near
his
home
and
his
own
people
joined
the
standard
of
the
pretender
little
james
never
forgot
these
things
and
long
afterwards
when
he
grew
to
be
a
man
and
wrote
poetry
it
was
full
of
the
sounds
of
battle
full
too
of
love
for
mountain
and
glen
and
their
rolling
mists
the
macphersons
were
poor
but
they
saw
that
their
son
was
clever
and
they
determined
that
he
should
be
well
taught
so
when
he
left
school
they
sent
him
to
college
first
to
aberdeen
and
then
to
edinburgh
before
he
was
twenty
james
had
left
college
and
become
master
of
the
school
in
his
own
native
village
he
did
not
however
like
that
very
much
and
soon
gave
it
up
to
become
tutor
in
a
family
by
this
time
james
macpherson
had
begun
to
write
poetry
he
had
also
gathered
together
some
pieces
of
old
gaelic
poetry
which
he
had
found
among
the
highland
folk
these
he
showed
to
some
other
poets
and
writers
whom
he
met
and
they
thought
them
so
beautiful
that
he
published
them
in
a
book
the
book
was
a
great
success
all
who
read
it
were
delighted
with
the
poems
and
said
that
if
there
was
any
more
such
poetry
in
the
highlands
it
should
be
gathered
together
and
printed
before
it
was
lost
and
forgotten
for
ever
for
since
the
the
english
had
done
everything
to
make
the
highlanders
forget
their
old
language
and
customs
they
were
forbidden
to
wear
the
kilt
or
the
tartan
and
everything
was
done
to
make
them
speak
english
and
forget
gaelic
so
now
people
begged
macpherson
to
travel
through
the
highlands
and
gather
together
as
much
of
the
old
poetry
of
the
people
as
he
could
macpherson
was
at
first
unwilling
to
go
for
one
thing
he
quite
frankly
owned
that
he
was
not
a
good
gaelic
scholar
but
at
length
he
consented
and
set
out
for
four
months
macpherson
wandered
about
the
highlands
and
islands
of
scotland
listening
to
the
tales
of
the
people
and
writing
them
down
sometimes
too
he
came
across
old
manuscripts
with
ancient
tales
in
them
when
he
had
gathered
all
he
could
he
returned
to
edinburgh
and
set
to
work
to
translate
the
stories
into
english
when
this
new
book
of
gaelic
poetry
came
out
it
again
was
a
great
success
it
was
greeted
with
delight
by
the
greatest
poets
of
france
germany
and
italy
and
was
soon
translated
into
many
languages
macpherson
was
no
longer
a
poor
highland
laddie
but
a
man
of
fame
yet
it
was
not
because
of
his
own
poetry
that
he
was
famous
but
because
he
had
found
so
he
said
some
poems
of
a
man
who
lived
fifteen
hundred
years
before
and
translated
them
into
english
and
although
macpherson
book
is
called
the
poems
of
ossian
it
is
written
in
prose
but
it
is
a
prose
which
is
often
far
more
beautiful
and
poetical
than
much
that
is
called
poetry
although
at
first
macpherson
book
was
received
with
great
delight
soon
people
began
to
doubt
about
it
the
irish
first
of
all
were
jealous
for
they
said
that
ossian
was
an
irish
poet
that
the
heroes
of
the
poems
were
irish
and
that
macpherson
was
stealing
their
national
heroes
from
them
then
in
england
people
began
to
say
that
there
never
had
been
an
ossian
at
all
and
that
macpherson
had
invented
both
the
poems
and
all
the
people
that
they
were
about
for
the
english
knew
little
of
the
highlanders
and
their
customs
even
after
the
and
the
people
in
the
south
knew
little
about
the
north
and
those
who
lived
there
they
thought
of
it
as
a
land
of
wild
mountains
and
glens
a
land
of
mists
and
cloud
a
land
where
wild
chieftains
ruled
over
still
wilder
clans
who
in
their
lonely
valleys
and
islands
were
for
ever
warring
against
each
other
how
could
such
a
people
they
asked
a
people
of
savages
make
beautiful
poetry
samuel
johnson
a
great
writer
of
whom
we
shall
hear
more
later
was
the
man
of
his
day
whose
opinion
about
books
was
most
thought
of
he
hated
scotland
and
the
scottish
folk
and
did
not
believe
that
any
good
thing
could
come
from
them
he
read
the
poems
and
said
that
they
were
rubbish
such
as
any
child
could
write
and
that
macpherson
had
made
them
all
up
so
a
quarrel
which
has
become
famous
began
between
the
two
men
and
as
johnson
was
far
better
known
than
macpherson
most
people
agreed
with
him
and
believed
that
macpherson
had
told
a
literary
lie
and
that
he
had
made
up
all
the
stories
there
is
no
harm
in
making
up
stories
nearly
every
one
who
writes
does
that
but
it
is
wrong
to
make
up
stories
and
then
pretend
that
they
were
written
by
some
one
else
more
famous
than
yourself
johnson
and
macpherson
were
very
angry
with
and
rude
to
each
other
still
that
did
not
settle
the
question
as
to
who
had
written
the
stories
indeed
it
has
never
been
settled
and
what
most
men
believe
now
is
that
macpherson
did
really
gather
from
among
the
people
of
the
highlands
many
scraps
of
ancient
poetry
and
tales
but
that
he
added
to
them
and
put
them
together
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
them
beautiful
and
touching
to
do
even
that
however
a
true
poet
was
needed
so
people
have
for
the
most
part
given
up
arguing
about
whether
macpherson
wrote
ossian
or
not
and
are
glad
that
such
a
beautiful
book
has
been
written
by
some
one
i
do
not
think
that
you
will
want
to
read
ossian
for
yourself
for
a
long
time
to
come
for
the
stories
are
not
always
easy
to
follow
they
are
too
often
clumsy
wandering
and
badly
put
together
but
in
spite
of
that
there
is
much
beauty
in
them
and
some
day
i
hope
you
will
read
them
in
the
next
chapter
you
will
find
one
of
the
stories
of
ossian
called
fingal
fingal
was
a
great
warrior
and
the
father
of
ossian
and
the
story
takes
place
in
ireland
it
is
told
partly
in
macpherson
words
chapter
v
the
story
of
fingal
cathullin
sat
by
tura
wall
by
the
tree
of
the
rustling
sound
his
spear
leaned
against
a
rock
his
shield
lay
on
grass
by
his
side
and
as
he
thus
sat
deep
in
thought
a
scout
came
running
in
all
haste
and
cried
cathullin
arise
i
see
the
ships
of
the
north
many
chief
of
men
are
the
foe
many
the
heroes
of
the
swaran
then
to
the
scout
the
chief
replied
ever
tremblest
thy
fears
have
increased
the
foe
it
is
fingal
king
of
deserts
who
comes
with
aid
to
green
erin
of
streams
i
beheld
their
chief
replied
the
scout
as
a
glittering
rock
his
spear
is
a
blasted
pine
his
shield
the
rising
moon
he
bade
me
say
to
thee
let
dark
cathullin
yield
replied
the
chief
never
yield
to
mortal
man
dark
cathullin
shall
be
great
or
dead
then
cathullin
bade
the
scout
summon
his
warriors
to
council
and
when
they
were
gathered
there
was
much
talk
for
some
would
give
battle
at
once
and
some
delay
until
fingal
the
king
of
morven
should
come
to
aid
them
but
cathullin
himself
was
eager
to
fight
so
forward
they
marched
to
meet
the
foe
and
the
sound
of
their
going
was
as
the
rushing
of
a
stream
of
foam
when
the
thunder
is
traveling
above
and
night
sits
on
half
the
hill
to
the
camp
of
swaran
was
the
sound
carried
so
that
he
sent
a
messenger
to
view
the
foe
he
went
he
trembling
swift
returned
his
eyes
rolled
wildly
round
his
heart
beat
high
against
his
side
his
words
were
faltering
broken
slow
son
of
ocean
arise
chief
of
the
dark
brown
shields
i
see
the
dark

mountain

of

i
fly
replied
the
king
fled
swaran
from
the
battle
of
spears
when
did
i
shrink
from
danger
chief

the
little
soul

swaran

from
a
hero
were
fingal
himself
before
me
my
soul
should
not
darken
in
fear
arise
to
battle
my
thousands
pour
round
me
like
the
echoing
main
gather
round
the
bright
steel
of
your
king
strong
as
the
rocks
of
my
land
that
meet
the
storm
with
joy
and
stretch
their
dark
pines
to
the
wind
like
autumn
dark
storms
pouring
from
two
echoing
hills
towards
each
other
approached
the
heroes
like
two
deep
streams
from
high
rocks
meeting
mixing
roaring
on
the
plain
loud
rough
and
dark
in
battle
meet
lochlin
and
chief
mixes
his
strokes
with
chief
and
man
with
man
steel
clanging
sounds
on
steel
helmets
are
cleft
on
high
blood
bursts
and
smokes
around
strings
murmur
on
the
polished
yews
darts
rush
along
the
sky
spears
fall
like
the
circles
of
light
which
gild
the
face
of
night
as
the
noise
of
the
troubled
ocean
when
roll
the
waves
on
high
as
the
last
peal
of
thunder
in
heaven
such
is
the
din
of
war
though
cormac
hundred
bards
were
there
to
give
the
fight
to
song
feeble
was
the
voice
of
a
hundred
bards
to
send
the
deaths
to
future
times
for
many
were
the
deaths
of
heroes
wide
poured
the
blood
of
the
brave
then
above
the
clang
and
clamor
of
dreadful
battle
we
hear
the
mournful
dirge
of
minstrels
wailing
the
dead
mourn
ye
sons
of
song
mourn
weep
on
the
rocks
of
roaring
winds
o
mad
of
inistore
bend
thy
fair
head
over
the
waves
thou
lovelier
than
the
ghost
of
the
hills
when
it
moves
in
a
sunbeam
at
noon
over
the
silence
of
morven
he
is
fallen
thy
youth
is
low
pale
beneath
the
sword
of
cathullin
no
more
shall
valor
raise
thy
love
to
match
the
blood
of
kings
his
gray
dogs
are
howling
at
home
they
see
his
passing
ghost
his
bow
is
in
the
hall
unstrung
no
sound
is
on
the
hill
of
his
hinds
then
once
again
the
louder
for
the
mourning
pause
we
hear
the
din
of
battle
as
roll
a
thousand
waves
to
the
rocks
so
swaran
host
came
on
as
meets
a
rock
a
thousand
waves
so
erin
met
swaran
of
spears
death
raises
all
his
voices
around
and
mixes
with
the
sounds
of
shields
each
hero
is
a
pillar
of
darkness
the
sword
a
beam
of
fire
in
his
hand
the
field
echoes
from
wing
to
wing
as
a
hundred
hammers
that
rise
by
turn
on
the
red
son
of
the
furnace
but
now
the
day
is
waning
to
the
noise
and
horror
of
battle
the
mystery
of
darkness
is
added
friend
and
foe
are
wrapped
in
the
dimness
of
twilight
but
the
fight
was
not
ended
for
neither
cathullin
nor
swaran
had
gained
the
victory
and
ere
gray
morning
broke
the
battle
was
renewed
and
in
this
second
day
fight
swaran
was
the
victor
but
while
the
battle
still
raged
ships
appeared
upon
the
sea
it
was
fingal
who
came
and
swaran
had
to
fight
a
second
foe
now
from
the
gray
mists
of
the
ocean
the
ships
of
fingal
appeared
high
is
the
grove
of
their
masts
as
they
nod
by
turns
on
the
rolling
wave
swaran
saw
them
from
the
hill
on
which
he
fought
and
turning
from
the
pursuit
of
the
men
of
erin
he
marched
to
meet
fingal
but
cathullin
beaten
and
ashamed
fled
to
hide
himself
bending
weeping
sad
and
slow
and
dragging
his
long
spear
behind
cathullin
sank
in
cromla
wood
and
mourned
his
fallen
friends
he
feared
the
face
of
fingal
who
was
wont
to
greet
him
from
the
fields
of
renown
but
although
cathullin
fled
between
fingal
and
swaran
battle
was
renewed
till
darkness
fell
a
second
day
dawned
and
again
and
again
the
hosts
closed
in
deadly
combat
until
at
length
fingal
and
swaran
met
face
to
face
there
was
a
clang
of
arms
their
every
blow
like
the
hundred
hammers
of
the
furnace
terrible
is
the
battle
of
the
kings
dreadful
the
look
of
their
eyes
their
dark
brown
shields
are
cleft
in
twain
their
steel
flies
broken
from
their
helms
they
fling
their
weapons
down
each
rushes
to
his
hero
grasp
their
sinewy
arms
bend
round
each
other
they
turn
from
side
to
side
and
strain
and
stretch
their
large
and
spreading
limbs
below
but
when
the
pride
of
their
strength
arose
they
shook
the
hills
with
their
heels
rocks
tumble
from
their
places
on
high
the
bushes
are
overturned
at
length
the
strength
of
swaran
fell
the
king
of
the
groves
is
bound
the
warriors
of
swaran
fled
then
pursued
by
the
sons
of
fingal
till
the
hero
bade
the
fighting
cease
and
darkness
once
more
fell
over
the
dreadful
field
the
clouds
of
night
come
rolling
down
darkness
rests
on
the
steeps
of
cromla
the
stars
of
the
north
arise
over
the
rolling
of
erin
waves
they
shew
their
heads
of
fire
through
the
flying
mist
of
heaven
a
distant
wind
roars
in
the
wood
silent
and
dark
is
the
plain
of
death
then
through
the
darkness
is
heard
the
sad
song
of
minstrels
mourning
for
the
dead
but
soon
the
scene
changes
and
mourning
is
forgotten
the
heroes
gathered
to
the
feast
a
thousand
aged
oaks
are
burning
to
the
wind
the
souls
of
warriors
brighten
with
joy
but
the
king
of
lochlin
swaran
is
silent
sorrow
reddens
in
his
eyes
of
pride
he
remembered
that
he
fell
fingal
leaned
on
the
shield
of
his
fathers
his
gray
locks
slowly
waved
on
the
wind
and
glittered
to
the
beam
of
night
he
saw
the
grief
of
swaran
and
spoke
to
the
first
of
the
bards
ullin
raise
the
song
of
peace
o
soothe
my
soul
from
war
let
mine
ear
forget
in
the
sound
the
dismal
noise
of
arms
let
a
hundred
harps
be
near
to
gladden
the
king
of
lochlin
he
must
depart
from
us
with
joy
none
ever
went
sad
from
fingal
the
lightening
of
my
sword
is
against
the
strong
in
fight
peaceful
it
lies
by
my
side
when
warriors
yield
in
war
so
at
the
bidding
of
fingal
the
minstrel
sang
and
soothed
the
grief
of
swaran
and
when
the
music
ceased
fingal
spoke
once
more
of
lochlin
let
thy
face
brighten
with
gladness
and
thine
ear
delight
in
the
harp
dreadful
as
the
storm
of
thine
ocean
thou
hast
poured
thy
valor
forth
thy
voice
has
been
like
the
voice
of
thousands
when
they
engage
in
war
raise
thy
white
sails
to
the
wind
or
dost
thou
choose
the
fight
that
thou
mayest
depart
renowned
like
the
sun
setting
in
the
west
then
swaran
chose
to
depart
in
peace
he
had
no
more
will
to
fight
against
fingal
so
the
two
heroes
swore
friendship
together
then
once
again
fingal
called
for
the
song
of
minstrels
a
hundred
voices
at
once
arose
a
hundred
harps
were
strung
they
sang
of
other
times
the
mighty
chiefs
of
other
years
and
so
the
night
passed
till
morning
trembles
with
the
beam
of
the
east
it
glimmers
on
cromla
side
over
lena
is
heard
the
horn
of
swaran
the
sons
of
the
ocean
gather
around
silent
and
sad
they
rise
on
the
wave
the
blast
of
erin
is
behind
their
sails
white
as
the
mist
of
morven
they
float
along
the
sea
thus
swaran
and
his
warriors
departed
and
fingal
calling
his
men
together
set
forth
to
hunt
and
as
he
hunted
far
in
the
woods
he
met
cathullin
still
hiding
sad
and
ashamed
but
fingal
comforted
the
beaten
hero
reminding
him
of
past
victories
together
they
returned
to
fingal
camp
and
there
the
heroes
sang
and
feasted
until
the
soul
of
cathullin
rose
the
strength
of
his
arm
returned
gladness
brightened
along
his
face
thus
the
night
passed
away
in
song
we
brought
back
the
morning
with
joy
fingal
arose
on
the
heath
and
shook
his
glittering
spear
he
moved
first
towards
the
plain
of
lena
we
followed
in
all
our
arms
the
sail
said
the
king
the
winds
as
they
pour
from
lena
we
rose
on
the
wave
with
songs
we
rushed
with
joy
through
the
foam
of
the
deep
thus
the
hero
returned
to
his
own
land
there
is
no
book
of
ossian
specially
edited
for
children
later
they
may
like
to
read
the
century
edition
of
ossian
edited
by
william
sharpe
stories
about
ossian
will
be
found
among
the
many
books
of
celtic
tales
now
published
chapter
vi
about
some
old
welsh
stories
and
you
remember
that
the
celtic
family
was
divided
into
two
branches
the
gaelic
and
the
cymric
so
far
we
have
only
spoken
about
the
gaels
but
the
cymry
had
their
poets
and
historians
too
the
cymry
however
do
not
claim
such
great
age
for
their
first
known
poets
as
do
the
gaels
ossian
you
remember
was
supposed
to
live
in
the
third
century
but
the
oldest
cymric
poets
whose
names
we
know
were
supposed
to
live
in
the
sixth
century
as
however
the
oldest
welsh
manuscripts
are
of
the
twelfth
century
it
is
again
very
difficult
to
prove
that
any
of
the
poems
were
really
written
by
those
old
poets
but
this
is
very
certain
that
the
cymry
like
the
gaels
had
their
bards
and
minstrels
who
sang
of
the
famous
deeds
of
heroes
in
the
halls
of
the
chieftains
or
in
the
for
the
people
from
the
time
that
the
romans
left
britain
to
the
time
when
the
saxons
or
english
were
at
length
firmly
settled
in
the
land
many
fierce
struggles
many
stirring
events
must
have
taken
place
that
time
must
have
been
full
of
brave
deeds
such
as
the
minstrels
loved
to
sing
but
that
part
of
our
history
is
very
dark
much
that
is
written
of
it
is
little
more
than
a
fairy
tale
for
it
was
not
until
long
afterwards
that
anything
about
this
time
was
written
down
the
great
hero
of
the
struggle
between
the
britons
and
the
saxons
was
king
arthur
but
it
was
not
until
many
many
years
after
the
time
in
which
he
lived
that
all
the
splendid
stories
of
his
knights
of
his
round
table
and
of
his
great
conquests
began
to
take
the
form
in
which
we
know
them
indeed
in
the
earliest
welsh
tales
the
name
of
arthur
is
hardly
known
at
all
when
he
is
mentioned
it
is
merely
as
a
warrior
among
other
warriors
equally
great
and
not
as
the
mighty
emperor
that
we
know
the
arthur
that
we
love
is
the
arthur
of
literature
not
the
arthur
of
history
and
i
think
you
may
like
to
follow
the
story
of
the
arthur
of
literature
and
see
how
from
very
little
it
has
grown
so
great
that
now
it
is
known
all
the
world
over
i
should
like
you
to
remember
too
that
the
arthur
story
is
not
the
only
one
which
repeats
itself
again
and
again
throughout
our
literature
there
are
others
which
have
caught
the
fancy
of
great
masters
and
have
been
told
by
them
in
varying
ways
throughout
the
ages
but
of
them
all
the
arthur
story
is
perhaps
the
best
example
of
the
old
welsh
poets
it
may
perhaps
be
interesting
to
remember
two
these
are
taliesin
or
shining
forehead
and
merlin
merlin
is
interesting
because
he
is
arthur
great
bard
and
magician
taliesin
is
interesting
because
in
a
book
called
the
mabinogion
which
is
a
translation
of
some
of
the
oldest
welsh
stories
we
have
the
tale
of
his
wonderful
birth
and
life
mabinogion
really
means
tales
for
the
young
except
the
history
of
taliesin
all
the
stories
in
this
book
are
translated
from
a
very
old
manuscript
called
the
red
book
of
this
red
book
belongs
to
the
fourteenth
century
but
many
of
the
stories
are
far
far
older
having
it
is
thought
been
told
in
some
form
or
other
for
hundreds
of
years
before
they
were
written
down
at
all
unlike
many
old
tales
too
they
are
written
in
prose
not
in
poetry
one
of
the
stories
in
the
mabinogion
the
story
of
king
ludd
takes
us
back
a
long
way
king
ludd
was
a
king
in
britain
and
in
another
book
we
learn
that
he
was
a
brother
of
cassevelaunis
who
fought
against
julius
caesar
so
from
that
we
can
judge
of
the
time
in
which
he
reigned
king
ludd
we
are
told
in
the
mabinogion
ruled
prosperously
and
rebuilt
the
walls
of
london
and
encompassed
it
about
with
numberless
towers
and
after
that
he
bade
the
citizens
build
houses
therein
such
as
no
houses
in
the
kingdom
could
equal
and
moreover
he
was
a
mighty
warrior
and
generous
and
liberal
in
giving
meat
and
drink
to
all
that
sought
them
and
though
he
had
many
castles
and
cities
this
one
loved
he
more
than
any
and
he
dwelt
therein
most
part
of
the
year
and
therefore
was
it
called
caer
ludd
and
at
last
caer
london
and
after
the
strange
race
came
there
it
was
called
london
it
is
interesting
to
remember
that
there
is
still
a
street
in
london
called
ludgate
caer
is
the
celtic
word
for
castle
and
is
still
to
be
found
in
many
welsh
names
such
as
carnarvon
caerleon
and
so
on
now
although
ludd
was
such
a
wise
king
three
plagues
fell
upon
the
island
of
britain
the
first
was
a
certain
race
that
came
and
was
called
coranians
and
so
great
was
their
knowledge
that
there
was
no
discourse
upon
the
face
of
the
island
however
low
it
might
be
spoken
but
what
if
the
wind
met
it
it
was
known
to
them
the
second
plague
was
a
shriek
which
came
on
every
over
every
hearth
in
the
island
of
britain
and
this
went
through
peoples
hearts
and
frightened
them
out
of
their
senses
the
third
plague
was
however
much
of
provision
and
food
might
be
prepared
in
the
king
courts
were
there
even
so
much
as
a
year
provision
of
meat
and
drink
none
of
it
could
ever
be
found
except
what
was
consumed
upon
the
first
night
the
story
goes
on
to
tell
how
good
king
ludd
freed
the
island
of
britain
from
all
three
plagues
and
lived
in
peace
all
the
days
of
his
life
in
five
of
the
stories
of
the
mabinogion
king
arthur
appears
and
although
these
were
all
written
in
welsh
it
has
been
thought
that
some
may
have
been
brought
to
wales
from
france
this
seems
strange
but
it
comes
about
in
this
way
part
of
france
is
called
brittany
as
you
know
now
long
long
ago
before
the
romans
came
to
britain
some
of
the
people
who
lived
in
that
part
of
france
sailed
across
the
sea
and
settled
in
britain
these
may
have
been
the
ancient
britons
whom
caesar
fought
when
he
first
came
to
our
shore
later
when
the
romans
left
our
island
and
the
picts
and
scots
oppressed
the
britons
many
of
them
fled
back
over
the
sea
to
brittany
or
armorica
as
it
used
to
be
called
later
still
when
the
saxons
came
the
britons
were
driven
by
degrees
into
the
mountains
of
wales
and
the
wilds
of
cornwall
while
others
fled
again
across
the
sea
to
brittany
these
took
with
them
the
stories
which
their
minstrels
told
and
told
them
in
their
new
home
so
it
came
about
that
the
stories
which
were
told
in
wales
and
in
cornwall
were
told
in
brittany
also
and
how
were
these
stories
brought
back
again
to
england
another
part
of
france
is
called
normandy
the
normans
and
the
bretons
were
very
different
peoples
as
different
as
the
britons
and
the
english
but
the
normans
conquered
part
of
brittany
and
a
close
relationship
grew
up
between
the
two
peoples
conan
duke
of
brittany
and
william
duke
of
normandy
were
related
to
each
other
and
in
a
manner
the
bretons
owned
the
duke
of
normandy
as
overlord
now
you
know
that
in
the
great
duke
william
came
sailing
over
the
sea
to
conquer
england
and
with
him
came
more
soldiers
from
brittany
than
from
any
other
land
perhaps
the
songs
of
the
minstrels
had
kept
alive
in
the
hearts
of
the
bretons
a
memory
of
their
island
home
perhaps
that
made
them
glad
to
come
to
help
to
drive
out
the
hated
saxons
at
any
rate
come
they
did
and
brought
with
them
their
minstrel
tales
and
soon
through
all
the
land
the
norman
power
spread
and
whether
they
first
heard
them
in
armorica
or
in
wild
wales
the
norman
minstrels
took
the
old
welsh
stories
and
made
them
their
own
and
the
best
of
all
the
tales
were
told
of
arthur
and
his
knights
doubtless
the
normans
added
much
to
these
stories
for
although
they
were
not
good
at
inventing
anything
they
were
very
good
at
taking
what
others
had
invented
and
making
it
better
and
the
english
too
as
norman
power
grew
clung
more
and
more
to
the
memory
of
the
past
they
forgot
the
difference
between
british
and
english
and
in
their
thoughts
arthur
grew
to
be
a
national
hero
a
hero
who
had
loved
his
country
and
who
was
not
norman
the
normans
then
brought
tales
of
arthur
with
them
when
they
came
to
england
they
heard
there
still
other
tales
and
improved
them
and
arthur
thus
began
to
grow
into
a
great
hero
i
will
now
go
on
to
show
how
he
became
still
greater
in
the
reign
of
henry
i
the
third
norman
king
who
ruled
our
land
there
lived
a
monk
called
geoffrey
of
monmouth
he
was
filled
with
the
love
of
his
land
and
he
made
up
his
mind
to
write
a
history
of
the
kings
of
britain
geoffrey
wrote
his
book
in
latin
because
at
this
time
it
was
the
language
which
most
people
could
understand
for
a
long
time
after
the
normans
came
to
england
they
spoke
norman
french
the
english
still
spoke
english
and
the
british
welsh
or
cymric
but
every
one
almost
who
could
read
at
all
could
read
latin
so
geoffrey
chose
to
write
in
latin
he
said
he
translated
all
that
he
wrote
from
an
old
british
book
which
had
been
brought
from
brittany
and
given
to
him
but
that
old
british
book
has
never
been
seen
by
any
one
and
it
is
generally
thought
that
geoffrey
took
old
welsh
tales
and
fables
for
a
foundation
invented
a
good
deal
more
and
so
made
his
history
and
that
the
old
british
book
never
existed
at
all
his
book
may
not
be
very
good
history
indeed
other
historians
were
very
angry
and
said
that
geoffrey
lied
saucily
and
shamelessly
but
it
is
very
delightful
to
read
geoffrey
chief
hero
is
arthur
and
we
may
say
that
it
is
from
this
time
that
arthur
became
a
great
hero
of
romance
for
geoffrey
told
his
stories
so
well
that
they
soon
became
famous
and
they
were
read
not
only
in
england
but
all
over
the
continent
soon
and
poets
in
other
lands
began
to
write
stories
about
arthur
too
and
from
then
till
now
there
has
never
been
a
time
when
they
have
not
been
read
so
to
the
welsh
must
be
given
the
honor
of
having
sown
a
seed
from
which
has
grown
the
tree
we
call
the
arthurian
legend
geoffrey
begins
his
story
long
before
the
time
of
arthur
he
begins
with
the
coming
of
brutus
the
ancient
hero
who
conquered
albion
and
changed
its
name
to
britain
and
he
continues
to
about
two
hundred
years
after
the
death
of
arthur
but
arthur
is
his
real
hero
so
he
tells
the
story
in
very
few
words
after
his
death
geoffrey
tells
of
many
battles
and
of
how
the
british
fought
not
only
with
the
saxons
but
among
themselves
and
at
last
he
says
as
barbarism
crept
in
they
were
no
longer
called
britons
but
welsh
a
word
derived
either
from
gualo
one
of
their
dukes
or
from
guales
their
queen
or
else
from
their
being
barbarians
but
the
saxons
did
wiselier
kept
peace
and
concord
amongst
themselves
tilling
their
fields
and
building
anew
their
cities
and
castles
but
the
welsh
degenerating
from
the
nobility
of
the
britons
never
after
recovered
the
sovereignty
of
the
island
but
on
the
contrary
quarreling
at
one
time
amongst
themselves
and
at
another
with
the
saxons
never
ceased
to
have
bloodshed
on
hand
either
in
public
or
private
feud
geoffrey
then
says
that
he
hands
over
the
matter
of
writing
about
the
later
welsh
and
saxon
kings
to
others
whom
i
bid
be
silent
as
to
the
kings
of
the
britons
seeing
that
they
have
not
that
book
in
the
british
speech
which
walter
archdeacon
of
oxford
did
convey
hither
out
of
brittany
the
which
i
have
in
this
wise
been
at
the
pains
of
translating
into
the
latin
speech
books
to
read
the
mabinogion
translated
by
lady
charlotte
guest
everyman
library
geoffrey
of
monmouth
histories
translated
by
sebastian
evans
chapter
vii
how
the
story
of
arthur
was
written
in
english
geoffrey
of
monmouth
had
written
his
stories
so
well
that
although
he
warned
people
not
to
write
about
the
british
kings
they
paid
no
heed
to
his
warning
soon
many
more
people
began
to
write
about
them
and
especially
about
arthur
in
geoffrey
died
and
that
year
a
frenchman
or
jerseyman
rather
named
robert
wace
finished
a
long
poem
which
he
called
li
romans
de
brut
or
the
romances
of
brutus
this
poem
was
founded
upon
geoffrey
history
and
tells
much
the
same
story
to
which
wace
has
added
something
of
his
own
besides
wace
many
writers
told
the
tale
in
french
for
french
you
must
remember
was
still
the
language
of
the
rulers
of
our
land
it
is
to
these
french
writers
and
chiefly
to
walter
map
perhaps
that
we
owe
something
new
which
was
now
added
to
the
arthur
story
walter
map
like
so
many
of
the
writers
of
this
early
time
was
a
priest
he
was
chaplain
to
henry
and
was
still
alive
when
john
the
bad
king
sat
upon
the
throne
the
first
writers
of
the
arthur
story
had
made
a
great
deal
of
manly
strength
it
was
often
little
more
than
a
tale
of
hard
knocks
given
and
taken
later
it
became
softened
by
the
thought
of
courtesy
with
the
idea
that
knights
might
give
and
take
these
hard
knocks
for
the
sake
of
a
lady
they
loved
and
in
the
cause
of
all
women
now
something
full
of
mystery
was
added
to
the
tale
this
was
the
quest
of
the
holy
grail
the
holy
grail
was
said
to
be
a
dish
used
by
christ
at
the
last
supper
it
was
also
said
to
have
been
used
to
hold
the
sacred
blood
which
when
christ
hung
upon
the
cross
flowed
from
his
wounds
the
holy
grail
came
into
the
possession
of
joseph
of
arimathea
and
by
him
was
brought
to
britain
but
after
a
time
the
vessel
was
lost
and
the
story
of
it
even
forgotten
or
only
remembered
in
some
dim
way
and
this
is
the
story
which
the
walter
map
used
to
give
new
life
and
new
glory
to
the
tales
of
arthur
he
makes
the
knights
of
the
round
table
set
forth
to
search
for
the
grail
they
ride
far
away
over
hill
and
dale
through
dim
forests
and
dark
waters
they
fight
with
men
and
fiends
alone
and
in
tournaments
they
help
fair
ladies
in
distress
they
are
tempted
to
sin
they
struggle
and
repent
for
only
the
pure
in
heart
may
find
the
holy
vessel
it
is
a
wonderful
and
beautiful
story
and
these
old
tellers
meant
it
to
be
something
more
than
a
fairy
tale
they
saw
around
them
many
wicked
things
they
saw
men
fighting
for
the
mere
love
of
fighting
they
saw
men
following
pleasure
for
the
mere
love
of
pleasure
they
saw
men
who
were
strong
oppress
the
weak
and
grind
down
the
poor
and
so
they
told
the
story
of
the
quest
of
the
holy
grail
to
try
to
make
them
a
little
better
with
every
new
writer
the
story
of
arthur
grew
it
seemed
to
draw
all
the
beauty
and
wonder
of
the
time
to
itself
and
many
stories
which
at
first
had
been
told
apart
from
it
came
to
be
joined
to
it
we
have
seen
how
it
has
been
told
in
welsh
in
latin
and
in
french
and
last
of
all
we
have
it
in
english
the
first
great
english
writer
of
the
stories
of
arthur
was
named
layamon
he
too
was
a
priest
and
like
wace
he
wrote
in
verse
like
wace
layamon
called
his
book
the
brut
because
it
is
the
story
of
the
britons
who
took
their
name
from
brutus
and
of
arthur
the
great
british
hero
this
book
is
known
therefore
as
layamon
brut
layamon
took
wace
book
for
a
foundation
but
he
added
a
great
deal
to
it
and
there
are
many
stories
in
layamon
not
to
be
found
in
wace
it
is
probable
that
layamon
did
not
make
up
these
stories
but
that
many
of
them
are
old
tales
he
heard
from
the
people
among
whom
he
lived
layamon
finished
his
book
towards
the
end
of
the
twelfth
century
or
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
perhaps
he
sat
quietly
writing
it
in
his
cell
when
the
angry
barons
were
forcing
king
john
to
sign
the
magna
charta
at
least
he
wrote
it
when
all
england
was
stirring
to
new
life
again
the
fact
that
he
wrote
in
english
shows
that
for
layamon
brut
is
the
first
book
written
in
english
after
the
conquest
this
book
proves
how
little
hold
the
french
language
had
upon
the
english
people
for
although
our
land
had
been
ruled
by
frenchmen
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
there
are
very
few
words
in
layamon
that
are
french
or
that
are
even
made
from
french
but
although
layamon
wrote
his
book
in
english
it
was
not
the
english
that
we
speak
it
was
what
is
called
early
english
or
even
sometimes
if
you
opened
a
book
of
layamon
brut
you
would
i
fear
not
be
able
to
read
it
we
know
very
little
of
layamon
all
that
we
do
know
he
tells
us
himself
in
the
beginning
of
his
poem
a
priest
was
in
the
land
he
says
layamon
was
he
called
he
was
leouenathe
son
the
lord
to
him
be
gracious
he
lived
at
ernleye
at
a
noble
church
upon
severn
bank
good
there
to
him
it
seemed
fast
by
radestone
where
he
books
read
it
came
to
him
in
mind
and
in
his
first
thoughts
that
he
would
of
england
the
noble
deeds
tell
what
they
were
named
and
whence
they
came
the
english
land
who
first
possessed
after
the
flood
which
from
the
lord
came
layamon
began
to
journey
far
he
went
over
the
land
and
won
the
noble
books
which
he
for
pattern
took
he
told
the
english
book
that
saint
beda
made
another
he
took
in
latin
which
saint
albin
made
and
the
fair
austin
who
baptism
brought
hither
book
the
third
he
took
laid
it
in
the
midst
that
the
french
clerk
made
wace
he
was
called
he
well
could
write
layamon
laid
these
books
down
and
the
leaves
turned
he
them
lovingly
beheld
the
lord
to
him
be
merciful
pen
he
took
in
fingers
and
wrote
upon
a
book
skin
and
the
true
words
set
together
and
the
three
books
pressed
to
one
that
in
words
such
as
we
use
now
is
how
layamon
begins
his
poem
but
this
is
how
the
words
looked
as
layamon
wrote
them
an
preost
wes
on
leoden
lazamon
wes
ihoten
he
wes
leouenaóes
sone
lióe
him
beo
drihte
you
can
see
that
it
would
not
be
very
easy
to
read
that
kind
of
english
nor
does
it
seem
very
like
poetry
in
either
the
old
words
or
the
modern
but
you
must
remember
that
old
english
poetry
was
not
like
ours
it
did
not
have
rhyming
words
at
the
end
of
the
lines
poetry
depended
for
its
pleasantness
to
the
ear
not
on
rhyme
as
does
ours
but
on
accent
and
alliteration
alliteration
means
the
repeating
of
a
letter
accent
means
that
you
rest
longer
on
some
syllables
and
say
them
louder
than
others
for
instance
if
you
take
the
line
the
way
was
long
the
wind
was
cold
way
long
wind
and
cold
are
accented
so
there
are
four
accents
in
that
line
now
in
poetry
the
lines
were
divided
into
two
lines
and
in
each
half
there
had
to
be
two
or
more
accented
syllables
but
there
might
also
be
as
many
unaccented
syllables
as
the
poet
liked
so
in
this
way
the
lines
were
often
very
unequal
some
being
quite
short
and
others
long
three
of
the
accented
syllables
generally
two
in
the
first
half
and
one
in
the
second
half
of
the
line
were
alliterative
that
is
they
began
with
the
same
letter
in
translating
of
course
the
alliteration
is
very
often
lost
but
sometimes
the
words
and
the
english
words
are
very
like
each
other
and
the
alliteration
can
be
kept
so
that
even
in
translation
we
can
get
a
little
idea
of
what
the
poetry
sounded
like
for
instance
the
line
wat
heo
ihoten
weoren
and
wonene
heo
comen
the
alliteration
is
on
w
and
may
be
translated
what
they
called
were
and
whence
they
came
still
keeping
the
alliteration
upon
these
rules
of
accent
and
alliteration
the
strict
form
of
verse
was
based
but
when
the
normans
came
they
brought
a
new
form
of
poetry
and
gradually
rhymes
began
to
take
the
place
of
alliteration
layamon
wrote
his
brut
more
than
a
hundred
years
after
the
coming
of
the
normans
and
although
his
poem
is
in
the
main
alliterative
sometimes
he
has
rhyming
lines
such
as
mochel
dal
heo
iwesten
mid
harmen
pen
mesten
that
is
great
part
they
laid
waste
with
harm
the
most
sometimes
even
in
translation
the
rhyme
may
be
kept
as
and
faer
forh
nu
to
niht
in
to
norewaieze
forh
riht
which
can
be
translated
and
fare
forth
now
into
norway
forth
right
at
times
too
layamon
has
neither
rhyme
nor
alliteration
in
his
lines
sometimes
he
has
both
so
that
his
poem
is
a
link
between
the
old
poetry
and
the
new
i
hope
that
you
are
not
tired
with
this
long
explanation
for
i
think
if
you
take
the
trouble
to
understand
it
it
may
make
the
rest
of
this
chapter
more
interesting
now
i
will
tell
you
a
little
more
of
the
poem
itself
layamon
tells
many
wonderful
stories
of
arthur
from
the
time
he
was
born
to
his
last
great
battle
in
which
he
was
killed
fighting
against
the
rebel
modred
this
is
how
layamon
tells
the
story
of
arthur
death
or
rather
of
his
passing
arthur
went
to
cornwall
with
a
great
army
modred
heard
that
and
he
against
him
came
with
unnumbered
folk
there
were
many
of
them
fated
upon
the
tambre
they
came
together
the
place
was
called
camelford
evermore
has
that
name
lasted
and
at
camelford
were
gathered
sixty
thousand
and
more
thousands
thereto
modred
was
their
chief
then
hitherward
gan
ride
arthur
the
mighty
with
numberless
folk
fated
though
they
were
upon
the
tambre
they
came
together
drew
their
long
swords
smote
on
the
helmets
so
that
fire
sprang
forth
spears
were
splintered
shields
gan
shatter
shafts
to
break
they
fought
all
together
folk
unnumbered
tambre
was
in
flood
with
unmeasured
blood
no
man
in
the
fight
might
any
warrior
know
nor
who
did
worse
nor
who
did
better
so
was
the
conflict
mingled
for
each
slew
downright
were
he
swain
were
he
knight
there
was
modred
slain
and
robbed
of
his
life
day
in
the
fight
there
were
slain
all
the
brave
arthur
warriors
noble
and
the
britons
all
of
arthur
board
and
all
his
lieges
of
many
a
kingdom
and
arthur
sore
wounded
with
war
spear
broad
fifteen
he
had
fearful
wounds
one
might
in
the
least
two
gloves
thrust
then
was
there
no
more
in
the
fight
on
life
of
two
hundred
thousand
men
that
there
lay
hewed
in
pieces
but
arthur
the
king
alone
and
of
his
knights
twain
but
arthur
was
sore
wounded
wonderously
much
then
to
him
came
a
knave
who
was
of
his
kindred
he
was
cador
son
the
earl
of
cornwall
constantine
hight
the
knave
he
was
to
the
king
dear
arthur
him
looked
on
where
he
lay
on
the
field
and
these
words
said
with
sorrowful
heart
constantine
thou
art
welcome
thou
wert
cador
son
i
give
thee
here
my
kingdom
guard
thou
my
britons
so
long
as
thou
livest
and
hold
them
all
the
laws
that
have
in
my
days
stood
and
all
the
good
laws
that
in
uther
days
stood
and
i
will
fare
to
avelon
to
the
fairest
of
all
maidens
to
argente
their
queen
an
elf
very
fair
and
she
shall
my
wounds
make
all
sound
all
whole
me
make
with
healing
draughts
and
afterwards
i
will
come
again
to
my
kingdom
and
dwell
with
the
britons
with
mickle
joy
even
with
the
words
that
came
upon
the
sea
a
short
boat
sailing
moving
amid
the
waves
and
two
women
were
therein
wounderously
clad
and
they
took
arthur
anon
and
bare
him
quickly
and
softly
him
adown
laid
and
to
glide
forth
gan
they
then
was
it
come
what
merlin
said
whilom
that
unmeasured
sorrow
should
be
at
arthur
forth
faring
britons
believe
yet
that
he
is
still
in
life
and
dwelleth
in
avelon
with
the
fairest
of
all
elves
and
every
briton
looketh
still
when
arthur
shall
return
was
never
the
man
born
nor
never
the
lady
chosen
who
knoweth
of
the
sooth
of
arthur
to
say
more
but
erstwhile
there
was
a
wizard
merlin
called
he
boded
with
words
the
which
were
sooth
that
an
arthur
should
yet
come
the
english
to
help
you
see
by
this
last
line
that
layamon
has
forgotten
the
difference
between
briton
and
english
he
has
forgotten
that
in
his
lifetime
arthur
fought
against
the
english
to
him
arthur
has
become
an
english
hero
and
perhaps
he
wrote
these
last
words
with
the
hope
in
his
heart
that
some
day
some
one
would
arise
who
would
deliver
his
dear
land
from
the
rule
of
the
stranger
normans
this
we
know
happened
not
indeed
by
the
might
of
one
man
but
by
the
might
of
the
english
spirit
the
strong
spirit
which
had
never
died
and
which
layamon
himself
showed
was
still
alive
when
he
wrote
his
book
in
english
chapter
viii
the
beginning
of
the
reading
time
we
are
now
going
on
two
hundred
years
to
speak
of
another
book
about
arthur
this
is
morte
by
sir
thomas
malory
up
to
this
time
all
books
had
to
be
written
by
hand
but
in
the
fifteenth
century
printing
was
discovered
this
was
one
of
the
greatest
things
which
ever
happened
for
literature
for
books
then
became
much
more
plentiful
and
were
not
nearly
so
dear
as
they
had
been
and
so
many
more
people
could
afford
to
buy
them
and
thus
learning
spread
it
is
not
quite
known
who
first
discovered
the
art
of
printing
but
william
caxton
was
the
first
man
who
set
up
a
in
england
he
was
an
english
wool
merchant
who
had
gone
to
live
in
bruges
but
he
was
very
fond
of
books
and
after
a
time
he
gave
up
his
wool
business
came
back
to
england
and
began
to
write
and
print
books
one
of
the
first
books
he
printed
was
malory
morte
in
the
preface
caxton
tells
us
how
after
he
had
printed
some
other
books
many
gentlemen
came
to
him
to
ask
him
why
he
did
not
print
a
history
of
king
arthur
which
ought
most
to
be
remembered
among
us
englishmen
afore
all
the
christian
kings
to
whom
i
answered
that
diverse
men
hold
opinion
that
there
was
no
such
arthur
and
all
such
books
as
be
made
of
him
be
but
fained
matters
and
fables
but
the
gentlemen
persuaded
caxton
until
at
last
he
undertook
to
imprint
a
book
of
the
noble
histories
of
the
said
king
arthur
and
of
certaine
of
his
knights
after
a
copy
unto
me
delivered
which
copy
sir
thomas
malory
tooke
out
of
certaine
bookes
in
the
frenche
and
reduced
it
into
english
it
is
a
book
caxton
says
wherein
ye
shall
find
many
joyous
and
pleasant
histories
and
noble
and
renowned
acts
doe
after
the
good
and
leave
the
ill
and
it
shall
bring
you
unto
good
fame
and
renowne
and
for
to
pass
the
time
this
booke
shall
be
pleasant
to
read
in
in
when
morte
was
first
printed
people
indeed
found
it
a
book
pleasant
to
read
in
and
we
find
it
so
still
it
is
written
in
english
not
unlike
the
english
of
and
although
it
has
a
quaint
sound
we
can
readily
understand
it
morte
really
means
the
death
of
arthur
but
the
book
tells
not
only
of
his
death
but
of
his
birth
and
life
and
of
the
wonderful
deeds
of
many
of
his
knights
this
is
how
malory
tells
of
the
manner
in
which
arthur
came
to
be
king
but
first
let
me
tell
you
that
uther
pendragon
the
king
had
died
and
although
arthur
was
his
son
and
should
succeed
to
him
men
knew
it
not
for
after
arthur
was
born
he
was
given
to
the
wizard
merlin
who
took
the
little
baby
to
sir
ector
a
gallant
knight
and
charged
him
to
care
for
him
and
sir
ector
knowing
nothing
of
the
child
brought
him
up
as
his
own
son
thus
after
the
death
of
the
king
the
realm
stood
in
great
jeopardy
a
long
while
for
every
lord
that
was
mighty
of
men
made
him
strong
and
many
weened
to
have
been
king
then
merlin
went
to
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
and
counselled
him
for
to
send
for
all
the
lords
of
the
realm
and
all
the
gentlemen
of
arms
that
they
should
come
to
london
afore
christmas
upon
pain
of
cursing
and
for
this
cause
that
as
jesus
was
born
on
that
night
that
he
would
of
his
great
mercy
show
some
miracle
as
he
was
come
to
be
king
of
all
mankind
for
to
show
some
miracle
who
should
be
right
wise
king
of
this
realm
so
the
archbishop
by
the
advice
of
merlin
sent
for
all
the
lords
and
gentlemen
of
arms
that
they
should
come
by
christmas
even
unto
london
so
in
the
greatest
church
of
london
whether
it
were
paul
or
not
the
french
book
maketh
no
mention
all
the
estates
were
long
day
in
the
church
for
to
pray
and
when
matins
and
the
first
mass
were
done
there
was
seen
in
the
churchyard
against
the
high
altar
a
great
stone
foursquare
like
unto
a
marble
stone
and
in
the
midst
thereof
was
like
an
anvil
of
steel
a
foot
on
high
and
therein
stuck
a
fair
sword
naked
by
the
point
and
letters
there
were
written
in
gold
about
the
sword
that
said
thus
pulleth
out
this
sword
of
the
stone
and
anvil
is
rightwise
king
born
of
all
england
then
the
people
marvelled
and
told
it
to
the
archbishop
so
when
all
masses
were
done
all
the
lords
went
to
behold
the
stone
and
the
sword
and
when
they
saw
the
scripture
some
essayed
such
as
would
have
been
king
but
none
might
stir
the
sword
nor
move
it
is
not
here
said
the
archbishop
shall
achieve
the
sword
but
doubt
not
god
will
make
him
known
but
this
is
my
counsel
said
the
archbishop
we
let
purvey
ten
knights
men
of
good
fame
and
they
to
keep
the
sword
so
it
was
ordained
and
then
there
was
made
a
cry
that
every
man
should
essay
that
would
for
to
win
the
sword
now
upon
new
year
day
when
the
service
was
done
the
barons
rode
unto
the
field
some
to
joust
and
some
to
tourney
and
so
it
happened
that
sir
ector
rode
unto
the
jousts
and
with
him
rode
sir
kay
his
son
and
young
arthur
that
was
his
nourished
brother
so
as
they
rode
to
the
sir
kay
had
lost
his
sword
for
he
had
left
it
at
his
father
lodging
and
so
he
prayed
young
arthur
for
to
ride
for
his
sword
will
well
said
arthur
and
rode
fast
after
the
sword
and
when
he
came
home
the
lady
and
all
were
out
to
see
the
jousting
then
was
arthur
wroth
and
said
to
himself
will
ride
to
the
churchyard
and
take
the
sword
with
me
that
sticketh
in
the
stone
for
my
brother
sir
kay
shall
not
be
without
a
sword
this
day
so
when
he
came
to
the
churchyard
sir
arthur
alit
and
tied
his
horse
to
the
stile
and
so
he
went
to
the
tent
and
found
no
knights
there
for
they
were
at
the
jousting
and
so
he
handled
the
sword
by
the
handles
and
lightly
and
fiercely
pulled
it
out
of
the
stone
and
took
his
horse
and
rode
his
way
until
he
came
to
his
brother
sir
kay
and
delivered
him
the
sword
and
as
soon
as
sir
kay
saw
the
sword
he
wist
well
it
was
the
sword
of
the
stone
and
he
rode
to
his
father
sir
ector
and
said
lo
here
is
the
sword
of
the
stone
wherefore
i
must
be
king
of
this
land
when
sir
ector
beheld
the
sword
he
returned
again
and
came
to
the
church
and
there
they
alit
all
three
and
went
into
the
church
and
anon
he
made
sir
kay
to
swear
upon
a
book
how
he
came
to
that
sword
said
sir
kay
my
brother
arthur
for
he
brought
it
to
me
got
ye
this
sword
said
sir
ector
to
arthur
i
will
tell
you
when
i
came
home
for
my
brother
sword
i
found
no
body
at
home
to
deliver
me
his
sword
and
so
i
thought
my
brother
sir
kay
should
not
go
swordless
and
so
i
came
hither
eagerly
and
pulled
it
out
of
the
stone
without
any
pain
ye
any
knights
about
the
sword
said
sir
ector
said
arthur
said
sir
ector
to
arthur
understand
ye
must
be
king
of
this
land
i
said
arthur
for
what
cause
said
ector
god
will
have
it
so
for
there
should
never
man
have
drawn
out
this
sword
but
he
that
should
be
rightwise
king
of
this
land
now
let
me
see
if
ye
can
put
the
sword
there
as
it
was
and
pull
it
out
again
is
no
mastery
said
arthur
and
so
he
put
it
in
the
stone
therewithall
sir
ector
essayed
to
pull
out
the
sword
and
failed
essay
said
sir
ector
unto
sir
kay
and
anon
he
pulled
at
the
sword
with
all
his
might
but
it
would
not
be
shall
ye
essay
said
sir
ector
unto
arthur
will
well
said
arthur
and
pulled
it
out
easily
and
therewithall
sir
ector
knelt
down
to
the
earth
and
sir
kay
and
so
arthur
was
acknowledged
king
and
so
anon
was
the
coronation
made
malory
goes
on
to
tell
us
and
there
was
arthur
sworn
unto
his
lords
and
to
the
commons
for
to
be
a
true
king
to
stand
with
true
justice
from
henceforth
the
days
of
his
life
for
the
rest
of
all
the
wonderful
stories
of
king
arthur
and
his
knights
you
must
go
to
morte
itself
for
the
language
is
so
simple
and
clear
that
it
is
a
book
that
you
can
easily
read
though
there
are
some
parts
that
you
will
not
understand
or
like
and
which
you
need
not
read
yet
but
of
all
the
books
of
which
we
have
spoken
this
is
the
first
which
you
could
read
in
the
very
words
in
which
it
was
written
down
i
do
not
mean
that
you
could
read
it
as
it
was
first
printed
for
the
oldest
kind
of
printing
was
not
unlike
the
writing
used
in
manuscripts
and
so
seems
hard
to
read
now
besides
which
although
nearly
all
the
words
malory
uses
are
words
we
still
use
the
spelling
is
a
little
different
and
that
makes
it
more
difficult
to
read
the
old
lettering
looked
like
this
with
that
sir
arthur
turned
with
his
knights
and
smote
behind
and
before
and
ever
sir
arthur
was
in
the
foremost
press
till
his
horse
was
slain
under
him
that
looks
difficult
but
here
it
is
again
in
our
own
lettering
with
that
sir
arthur
turned
with
his
knights
and
smote
behind
and
before
and
ever
sir
arthur
was
in
the
foremost
press
till
his
horse
was
slain
under
him
that
is
quite
easy
to
read
and
there
is
not
a
word
in
it
that
you
can
not
understand
for
since
printing
came
our
language
has
changed
very
much
less
than
it
did
before
and
when
printing
came
the
listening
time
of
the
world
was
done
and
the
reading
time
had
begun
as
books
increased
less
and
less
did
people
gather
to
hear
others
read
aloud
or
tell
tales
and
more
and
more
people
learned
to
read
for
themselves
until
now
there
is
hardly
a
boy
or
girl
in
all
the
land
who
can
not
read
a
little
it
is
perhaps
because
morte
is
easily
read
that
it
has
become
a
storehouse
a
to
which
other
writers
have
gone
and
from
which
they
have
taken
stories
and
woven
them
afresh
and
given
them
new
life
since
caxton
time
morte
has
been
printed
many
times
and
it
is
through
it
perhaps
more
than
through
the
earlier
books
that
the
stories
of
arthur
still
live
for
us
yet
it
is
not
perfect
it
has
indeed
been
called
a
most
pleasant
jumble
malory
made
up
none
of
the
stories
as
he
himself
tells
us
he
took
them
from
french
books
and
in
some
of
these
french
books
the
stories
are
told
much
better
but
what
we
have
to
remember
and
thank
malory
for
is
that
he
kept
alive
the
stories
of
arthur
he
did
this
more
than
any
other
writer
in
that
he
wrote
in
english
such
as
all
people
must
love
to
read
furnivell
books
to
read
stories
of
king
arthur
knights
by
mary
macgregor
stories
from
morte
by
thomson
morte
globe
edition
chapter
ix
the
passing
of
arthur
four
hundred
years
after
malory
wrote
his
book
another
english
writer
told
the
tales
of
arthur
anew
this
was
the
poet
alfred
lord
tennyson
he
told
them
in
poetry
tennyson
calls
his
poems
the
idylls
of
the
king
idyll
means
a
short
poem
about
some
simple
and
beautiful
subject
the
king
that
tennyson
sings
of
is
the
great
king
arthur
tennyson
takes
his
stories
some
from
the
mabinogion
some
from
malory
some
from
other
books
he
has
told
them
in
very
beautiful
english
and
it
is
the
english
such
as
we
speak
he
has
smoothed
away
much
that
strikes
us
as
rough
and
coarse
in
the
old
stories
and
his
poems
are
as
different
from
the
old
stories
as
a
polished
diamond
is
different
from
the
stone
newly
brought
out
of
the
mine
yet
we
miss
something
of
strength
and
vigor
the
arthur
of
the
idylls
is
not
the
arthur
of
the
mabinogion
nor
of
malory
indeed
tennyson
makes
him
almost
too
good
to
be
true
he
is
ideal
manhood
closed
in
real
man
rather
than
that
gray
king
of
old
and
now
i
will
give
you
part
of
the
last
of
the
arthur
poems
the
passing
of
arthur
so
that
you
may
read
it
along
with
account
of
the
hero
death
and
see
for
yourselves
the
difference
between
the
two
the
passing
of
arthur
is
written
in
blank
verse
that
is
verse
which
does
not
rhyme
and
which
depends
like
the
old
english
verse
on
the
accent
yet
they
are
not
alike
so
all
day
long
the
noise
of
battle
among
the
mountains
by
the
winter
sea
until
king
arthur
table
man
by
man
had
in
lyonnesse
about
their
lord
king
arthur
then
because
his
wound
was
deep
the
bold
sir
bedivere
uplifted
him
and
bore
him
to
a
chapel
nigh
the
field
a
broken
chancel
by
a
broken
cross
that
stood
in
a
dark
strait
of
barren
land
on
one
side
lay
the
ocean
and
on
one
lay
a
great
water
and
the
moon
was
full
then
the
king
bids
sir
bedivere
take
his
sword
excalibur
and
fling
him
far
into
the
middle
mere
watch
what
thou
seest
and
lightly
bring
me
word
sir
bedivere
takes
the
sword
and
from
the
ruin
shrine
he
stept
and
in
the
moon
athwart
the
place
of
tombs
where
lay
the
mighty
bones
of
ancient
men
old
knights
and
over
them
the
sang
shrill
chill
with
flakes
of
foam
he
stepping
down
by
zigzag
paths
and
juts
of
pointed
rock
came
on
the
shining
levels
of
the
lake
but
when
sir
bedivere
drew
excalibur
and
saw
the
jewels
of
the
hilt
shine
in
the
wintry
moonlight
he
could
not
find
it
in
his
heart
to
cast
anything
so
beautiful
and
precious
from
him
so
hiding
it
among
the
reeds
by
the
water
edge
he
returned
to
his
master
then
spake
king
arthur
to
sir
bedivere
thou
perform
my
mission
which
i
gave
what
is
it
thou
hast
seen
or
what
hast
heard
and
answer
made
the
bold
sir
bedivere
heard
the
ripple
washing
in
the
reeds
and
the
wild
water
lapping
on
the
crag
but
king
arthur
well
knew
that
sir
bedivere
had
not
obeyed
him
this
is
a
shameful
thing
for
men
to
lie
he
said
and
once
more
sent
the
knight
to
do
his
bidding
again
sir
bedivere
went
but
again
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
cast
away
the
sword
the
king
is
sick
and
knows
not
what
he
does
he
said
to
himself
so
a
second
time
he
hid
the
sword
and
returned
then
spake
king
arthur
breathing
heavily
is
it
thou
hast
seen
or
what
hast
heard
and
answer
made
the
bold
sir
bedivere
heard
the
water
lapping
on
the
crag
and
the
long
ripple
washing
in
the
reeds
to
whom
replied
king
arthur
much
in
wrath
miserable
and
unkind
untrue
unknightly
woe
is
me
authority
forgets
a
dying
king
then
sorrowful
and
abashed
before
the
anger
of
the
dying
king
sir
bedivere
turned
and
running
quickly
lest
his
courage
should
fail
him
he
reached
the
water
edge
and
flung
the
sword
far
into
the
lake
but
ere
he
dip
the
surface
rose
an
arm
clothed
in
white
samite
mystic
wonderful
and
caught
him
by
the
hilt
and
brandish
him
three
times
and
drew
him
under
in
the
mere
then
sir
bedivere
in
wonder
returned
to
the
king
who
when
he
saw
him
come
cried
see
i
by
thine
eyes
that
this
is
done
speak
out
what
is
it
thou
hast
heard
or
seen
so
sir
bedivere
told
the
king
how
truly
this
time
he
had
cast
away
the
sword
and
how
an
arm
clothed
in
white
samite
mystic
wonderful
had
caught
it
and
drawn
it
under
the
mere
then
at
the
king
bidding
sir
bedivere
raised
arthur
and
bore
him
to
the
water
edge
then
saw
they
how
there
hove
a
dusky
barge
dark
as
a
funeral
scarf
from
stem
to
stern
beneath
them
and
descending
they
were
ware
that
all
the
decks
were
dense
with
stately
forms
like
a
dream
by
these
three
queens
with
crowns
of
gold
and
from
them
rose
a
cry
that
shiver
to
the
tingling
start
and
as
it
were
one
voice
an
agony
of
lamentation
like
a
wind
that
shrills
all
night
in
a
waste
land
where
no
one
comes
or
hath
come
since
the
making
of
the
world
then
murmur
arthur
me
in
the
barge
so
to
the
barge
they
came
there
those
three
queens
put
forth
their
hands
and
took
the
king
and
wept
then
slowly
from
the
shore
the
barge
moved
and
sir
bedivere
as
he
saw
his
master
go
was
filled
with
grief
and
loneliness
for
he
only
of
all
the
brave
king
knights
was
left
and
so
he
cried
in
mourning
my
lord
arthur
wither
shall
i
go
where
shall
i
hide
my
forehead
and
my
eyes
for
now
i
see
the
true
old
times
are
dead
and
i
the
last
go
forth
companionless
and
the
days
darken
round
me
and
the
years
among
new
men
strange
faces
other
minds
mournfully
from
the
barge
arthur
answered
and
bade
him
pray
for
more
things
are
wrought
by
prayer
than
the
world
dreams
of
and
so
he
said
farewell
and
the
barge
with
oar
and
sail
moved
from
the
brink
like
some
swan
long
stood
sir
bedivere
thinking
of
all
that
had
come
and
gone
watching
the
barge
as
it
glided
silently
away
and
listening
to
the
wailing
voices
till
the
hull
look
one
black
dot
against
the
verge
of
dawn
and
on
the
mere
the
wailing
died
away
sir
bedivere
turned
then
and
climbed
to
the
highest
he
could
climb
and
saw
straining
his
eyes
beneath
an
arch
of
hand
or
thought
he
saw
the
speck
that
bore
the
king
down
that
long
water
opening
on
the
deep
somewhere
far
off
pass
on
and
on
and
go
from
less
to
less
and
vanish
into
light
and
the
new
sun
rose
bringing
the
new
year
the
poem
moves
along
with
mournful
stately
measures
yet
it
closes
like
layamon
farewell
to
arthur
on
a
note
of
hope
layamon
recalls
merlin
words
the
which
were
sooth
that
an
arthur
should
yet
come
the
english
to
help
the
hope
of
tennyson
is
different
not
that
the
old
will
return
but
that
the
new
will
take
its
place
for
the
old
order
changeth
yielding
place
to
new
and
god
fulfils
himself
in
many
ways
the
old
sorrows
vanish
into
light
and
the
new
sun
ever
rises
bringing
in
the
new
year
books
to
read
idylls
of
the
king
by

macmillan
chapter
x
the
adventures
of
an
old
english
book
the
story
of
arthur
has
led
us
a
long
way
we
have
almost
forgotten
that
it
began
with
the
old
cymric
stories
the
stories
of
the
people
who
lived
in
britain
before
the
coming
of
the
romans
we
have
followed
it
before
the
coming
of
the
romans
we
have
followed
it
down
through
many
forms
welsh
in
the
stories
of
the
mabinogion
latin
in
the
stories
of
geoffrey
of
monmouth
french
in
the
stories
of
wace
and
map
in
the
stories
of
layamon
middle
english
in
the
stories
of
malory
and
at
last
english
as
we
now
speak
it
in
the
stories
of
tennyson
now
we
must
go
back
and
see
why
it
is
that
our
literature
is
english
and
why
it
is
that
we
speak
english
and
not
gaelic
or
cymric
or
latin
or
french
and
then
from
its
beginnings
we
will
follow
our
english
literature
through
the
ages
since
historical
times
the
land
we
now
call
england
has
been
conquered
three
times
for
we
need
hardly
count
the
danish
invasion
it
was
conquered
by
the
romans
it
was
conquered
by
the
english
and
it
was
conquered
by
the
normans
it
was
only
england
that
felt
the
full
weight
of
these
conquests
scotland
ireland
and
in
part
wales
were
left
almost
untouched
and
of
the
three
it
was
only
the
english
conquest
that
had
lasting
effects
in
the
romans
landed
in
britain
and
for
nearly
four
hundred
years
after
that
they
kept
coming
and
going
all
south
britain
became
a
roman
province
and
the
people
paid
tribute
or
taxes
to
the
roman
emperor
but
they
did
not
become
romans
they
still
kept
their
own
language
their
own
customs
and
religions
it
will
help
you
to
understand
the
state
of
britain
in
those
old
days
if
you
think
of
india
india
forms
part
of
the
british
empire
but
the
people
who
live
there
are
not
british
they
are
still
indians
who
speak
their
own
languages
and
have
their
own
customs
and
religions
the
rulers
only
are
british
it
was
in
much
the
same
way
that
britain
was
a
roman
province
and
so
our
literature
was
never
latin
there
was
indeed
a
time
when
nearly
all
our
books
were
written
in
latin
but
that
was
later
and
not
because
latin
was
the
language
of
the
people
but
because
it
was
the
language
of
the
learned
and
of
the
monks
who
were
the
chief
people
who
wrote
books
when
then
after
nearly
four
hundred
years
the
romans
went
away
the
people
of
britain
were
still
british
but
soon
another
people
came
these
were
the
the
english
who
came
from
over
the
sea
and
little
by
little
they
took
possession
of
britain
they
drove
the
old
dwellers
out
until
it
was
only
in
the
north
in
wales
and
in
cornwall
that
they
were
to
be
found
then
britain
became
angleland
or
england
and
the
language
was
no
longer
celtic
but
english
and
although
there
are
a
few
words
in
our
language
which
can
be
traced
to
the
old
celtic
these
are
very
few
it
is
thus
from
and
not
from
gaelic
or
cymric
that
the
language
we
speak
comes
yet
our
celtic
forefathers
have
given
something
to
our
literature
which
perhaps
we
could
never
have
had
from
english
alone
the
celtic
literature
is
full
of
wonder
it
is
full
of
a
tender
magic
and
makes
us
feel
the
fairy
charm
of
nature
although
it
has
not
the
strength
the
downrightness
we
might
say
of
the
english
it
has
been
said
that
every
poet
has
somewhere
in
him
a
celtic
strain
that
is
perhaps
too
much
to
believe
but
it
is
perhaps
the
celtic
love
of
beauty
together
with
the
saxon
love
of
strength
and
right
to
which
we
owe
much
of
our
great
literature
the
celtic
languages
are
dying
out
but
they
have
left
us
something
which
will
last
so
long
as
our
literature
lasts
and
now
having
talked
in
the
beginning
of
this
book
of
the
stories
which
we
owe
to
our
celtic
forefathers
let
us
see
what
the
saxons
brought
us
from
over
the
sea
almost
the
oldest
book
that
we
have
is
called
beowulf
wise
men
tell
us
that
like
the
tales
of
arthur
like
the
tales
of
ossian
this
book
was
not
at
first
the
work
of
one
man
but
that
it
has
been
gradually
put
together
out
of
many
minstrel
songs
that
may
be
so
but
what
is
sure
is
that
these
tales
are
very
old
and
that
they
were
sung
and
told
for
many
years
in
the
old
homes
of
the
english
across
the
sea
before
they
came
to
britain
and
named
it
angleland
yet
as
with
the
old
gaelic
and
cymric
tales
we
have
no
very
old
copy
of
this
tale
but
unlike
these
old
tales
we
do
not
find
beowulf
told
in
different
ways
in
different
manuscripts
there
is
only
one
copy
of
beowulf
and
that
was
probably
written
in
the
tenth
or
eleventh
century
long
years
after
the
english
were
firmly
settled
in
the
land
as
beowulf
is
one
of
our
great
book
treasures
you
may
like
to
hear
something
of
its
story
long
ago
in
the
time
when
queen
elizabeth
james
and
charles
sat
upon
the
throne
there
lived
a
learned
gentleman
called
sir
robert
bruce
cotton
he
was
an
antiquary
that
is
he
loved
old
things
and
he
gathered
together
old
books
coins
manuscripts
and
other
articles
which
are
of
interest
because
they
help
to
make
us
understand
the
history
of
bygone
days
sir
robert
cotton
loved
books
especially
and
like
many
other
book
lovers
he
was
greedy
of
them
it
was
said
indeed
that
he
often
found
it
hard
to
return
books
which
had
been
lent
to
him
and
that
among
others
he
had
books
which
really
ought
to
have
belonged
to
the
king
sir
robert
library
soon
became
famous
and
many
scholars
came
to
read
there
for
sir
robert
was
very
kind
in
allowing
other
people
to
use
his
books
but
twice
his
library
was
taken
from
him
because
it
was
said
that
it
contained
things
which
were
dangerous
for
people
to
know
and
that
he
allowed
the
enemies
of
the
king
to
use
it
that
was
in
the
days
of
charles
and
those
were
troublous
times
the
second
time
that
his
library
was
taken
from
him
sir
robert
died
but
it
was
given
back
to
his
son
and
many
years
later
his
gave
it
to
the
nation
in
the
house
in
which
the
library
was
took
fire
and
more
than
a
hundred
books
were
burned
some
being
partly
and
some
quite
destroyed
among
those
that
were
partly
destroyed
was
beowulf
but
no
one
cared
very
much
for
no
one
had
read
the
book
or
knew
anything
about
it
where
sir
robert
found
beowulf
or
what
he
thought
about
it
we
shall
never
know
very
likely
it
had
remained
in
some
quiet
monastery
library
for
hundreds
of
years
until
henry
viii
scattered
the
monks
and
their
books
many
books
were
then
lost
but
some
were
saved
and
after
many
adventures
found
safe
among
those
was
beowulf
some
years
after
the
fire
the
cotton
library
as
it
is
now
called
was
removed
to
the
british
museum
where
it
now
remains
and
there
a
danish
gentleman
who
was
looking
for
books
about
his
own
land
found
beowulf
and
made
a
copy
of
it
its
adventures
however
were
not
over
just
when
the
printed
copies
were
ready
to
be
published
the
british
bombarded
copenhagen
the
house
in
which
the
copies
were
was
set
on
fire
and
they
were
all
burned
the
danish
gentleman
however
was
not
daunted
he
set
to
work
again
and
at
last
beowulf
was
published
even
after
it
was
published
in
denmark
no
englishman
thought
of
making
a
translation
of
the
book
and
it
was
not
until
fifty
years
more
had
come
and
gone
that
an
english
translation
appeared
when
the
danish
gentleman
made
his
copy
of
beowulf
he
found
the
edges
of
the
book
so
charred
by
fire
that
they
broke
away
with
the
slightest
touch
no
one
thought
of
mending
the
leaves
and
as
years
went
on
they
fell
to
pieces
more
and
more
but
at
last
some
one
woke
up
to
the
fact
that
this
book
was
a
great
treasure
then
it
was
carefully
mended
and
thus
kept
from
wasting
more
so
now
after
all
its
adventures
having
been
found
we
shall
never
know
where
by
a
gentleman
in
the
days
of
queen
elizabeth
having
lain
on
his
bookshelves
unknown
and
unread
for
a
hundred
years
and
more
having
been
nearly
destroyed
by
fire
having
been
still
further
destroyed
by
neglect
beowulf
at
last
came
to
its
own
and
is
now
carefully
treasured
in
a
glass
case
in
the
british
museum
where
any
one
who
cared
about
it
may
go
to
look
at
it
and
although
it
is
perhaps
not
much
to
look
at
it
is
a
very
great
treasure
for
it
is
not
only
the
oldest
epic
poem
in
the
language
it
is
history
too
by
that
i
do
not
mean
that
the
story
is
all
true
but
that
by
reading
it
carefully
we
can
find
out
much
about
the
daily
lives
of
our
forefathers
in
their
homes
across
the
seas
and
besides
this
some
of
the
people
mentioned
in
the
poem
are
mentioned
in
history
too
and
it
is
thought
that
beowulf
the
hero
himself
really
lived
and
now
having
spoken
about
the
book
and
its
adventures
let
us
in
the
next
chapter
speak
about
the
story
as
usual
i
will
give
part
of
it
in
the
words
of
the
original
translated
of
course
into
modern
english
you
can
always
tell
what
is
from
the
original
by
the
quotation
marks
if
by
nothing
else
chapter
xi
the
story
of
beowulf
hrothgar
king
of
the
spear
danes
was
a
mighty
man
in
war
and
when
he
had
fought
and
conquered
much
he
bethought
him
that
he
would
build
a
great
and
splendid
hall
wherein
he
might
feast
and
be
glad
with
his
people
and
so
it
was
done
and
when
the
hall
was
built
there
night
by
night
the
thanes
gathered
and
rejoiced
with
their
king
and
there
when
the
feast
was
over
they
lay
them
down
to
sleep
within
the
hall
all
was
gladness
but
without
on
the
lone
moorland
there
stalked
a
grim
monster
named
grendel
whose
dark
heart
was
filled
with
anger
and
hate
to
him
the
sound
of
song
and
laughter
was
deep
pain
and
he
was
fain
to
end
it
he
the
grendel
set
off
then
after
night
was
come
to
seek
the
lofty
house
to
see
how
the
ring
danes
had
ordered
it
after
the
service
of
beer
he
found
them
therein
a
troup
of
nobles
sleeping
after
the
feast
they
knew
not
sorrow
the
wretchedness
of
men
they
knew
not
aught
of
misfortune
the
grim
and
greedy
one
was
soon
prepared
savage
and
fierce
and
in
sleep
he
seized
upon
thirty
of
the
thanes
and
thence
he
again
departed
exulting
in
his
prey
to
go
home
with
the
carcases
of
the
slain
to
reach
his
own
dwelling
then
was
in
the
morning
twilight
at
the
breaking
of
day
grendel
revealed
to
men
then
was
lamentation
upraised
after
the
feast
a
great
noise
in
the
morning
the
mighty
prince
a
noble
of
old
goodness
sat
unblithe
the
strong
in
armies
suffered
the
thanes
endured
sorrow
after
they
beheld
the
track
of
the
hated
one
the
accursed
spirit
but
in
spite
of
all
their
grief
and
horror
when
night
came
the
thanes
again
lay
down
to
rest
in
the
great
hall
and
there
again
the
monster
returned
and
slew
yet
more
thanes
so
that
in
horror
all
forsook
the
hall
and
for
twelve
long
years
none
abode
in
it
after
the
setting
of
the
sun
and
now
far
across
the
sea
a
brave
man
of
the
goths
beowulf
by
name
heard
of
the
doings
of
grendel
and
he
made
up
his
mind
to
come
to
the
aid
of
king
hrothgar
he
commanded
to
make
ready
for
him
a
good
ship
quoth
he
he
would
seek
the
over
the
swan
path
the
renowned
prince
since
he
had
need
of
men
the
good
chieftain
had
chosen
warriors
of
the
geátish
people
the
bravest
of
those
who
he
could
find
with
fifteen
men
he
sought
the
a
warrior
a
man
crafty
in
lakes
pointed
out
the
boundaries
of
the
land
the
time
passed
on
the
ship
was
on
the
waves
the
boat
beneath
a
mountain
the
ready
warriors
stept
upon
the
prow
the
men
bore
into
the
bosom
of
the
bark
bright
ornaments
their
ready
warlike
appointments
the
men
shoved
forth
the
bounden
wood
the
men
upon
the
journey
they
desired
the
likest
to
a
bird
the
ship
propelled
by
the
wind
started
over
the
deep
waves
of
the
sea
till
that
about
one
hour
of
the
second
day
the
wreathed
prowed
ship
had
sailed
over
so
that
the
traveller
saw
the
land
then
quickly
the
people
of
the
westerns
stepped
upon
the
plain
they
tied
the
they
let
down
their
shirts
of
mail
their
they
thanked
god
because
that
the
waves
had
been
easy
to
them
and
now
these
warriors
were
led
to
king
hrothgar
he
greeted
them
with
joy
and
after
feasting
and
song
the
danes
and
their
king
departed
and
left
the
goths
to
guard
the
hall
quietly
they
lay
down
to
rest
knowing
that
ere
morning
stern
battle
would
be
theirs
then
under
veils
of
mist
came
grendel
from
the
moor
he
bare
god
anger
the
criminal
meant
to
entrap
some
one
of
the
race
of
men
in
the
high
hall
he
went
under
the
welkin
until
he
saw
most
clearly
the
wine
hall
the
treasure
house
of
men
variegated
with
vessels
that
was
not
the
first
time
that
he
had
sought
hrothgar
home
never
he
in
all
his
life
before
or
since
found
bolder
men
keepers
of
the
hall
angry
of
mood
he
went
from
his
eyes
likest
to
fire
stood
out
a
hideous
light
he
saw
within
the
house
many
a
warrior
sleeping
a
peaceful
band
together
then
his
mood
laughed
the
foul
wretch
meant
to
divide
ere
day
came
the
life
of
each
from
his
body
quickly
then
he
seized
a
warrior
and
as
quickly
devoured
him
but
as
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
to
seize
another
beowulf
gripped
him
in
his
awful
grasp
then
began
a
terrible
combat
the
hall
echoed
with
cries
and
sounds
of
clashing
steel
the
goths
awoke
joining
in
the
fight
but
all
their
swords
were
of
no
avail
against
the
ogre
with
his
bare
hands
alone
beowulf
fought
and
thought
to
kill
the
monster
but
grendel
escaped
though
wounded
to
death
indeed
and
leaving
his
hand
arm
and
shoulder
behind
in
beowulf
grip
when
morning
came
there
was
much
rejoicing
hrothgar
made
a
great
feast
at
which
he
gave
rich
gifts
to
beowulf
and
his
friends
the
evening
passed
in
song
and
laughter
and
when
darkness
fell
the
danes
lay
down
to
rest
in
the
hall
as
of
old
but
the
evil
was
not
over
grendel
indeed
was
slain
but
his
mother
an
ogre
almost
as
fierce
as
he
was
ready
to
avenge
him
so
when
night
fell
she
hastened
to
the
hall
and
carried
off
hrothgar
best
loved
thane
then
was
there
a
cry
in
heorot
then
was
the
prudent
king
the
hoary
warrior
sad
of
mood
when
he
learned
that
his
princely
thane
the
dearest
to
him
no
longer
lived
quickly
was
beowulf
fetched
to
the
bower
the
man
happy
in
victory
at
break
of
day
and
when
beowulf
heard
the
mournful
tale
he
comforted
the
king
with
brave
and
kindly
words
and
quickly
he
set
forth
to
the
dreadful
mere
the
dwelling
of
the
grendel
mother
and
here
he
plunged
in
ready
to
fight
soon
did
she
who
thirsting
for
gore
grim
and
greedy
for
a
hundred
years
had
held
the
circuit
of
the
waves
discover
that
some
one
of
men
some
strange
being
was
trying
from
above
the
land
she
grappled
then
towards
him
she
seized
the
warrior
in
her
foul
claws
then
beneath
the
waves
was
there
a
fierce
struggle
but
beowulf
in
the
end
conquered
the
was
slain
and
rejoicing
the
hero
returned
to
hrothgar
now
indeed
had
peace
come
to
the
danes
and
loaded
with
thanks
and
rewards
beowulf
returned
homeward
many
years
passed
beowulf
himself
became
king
in
his
own
land
and
for
fifty
years
he
ruled
well
and
kept
his
folk
in
peace
then
it
fell
that
a
fearful
wasted
all
the
land
and
beowulf
mindful
of
his
deeds
of
old
set
forth
to
slay
him
yet
ere
he
fought
he
bade
farewell
to
all
his
thanes
for
he
knew
well
that
this
should
be
his
last
fight
then
greeted
he
every
one
of
the
men
the
bold
helm
bearer
greeted
his
dear
comrades
for
the
last
time
i
would
not
bear
sword
or
weapon
against
the
worm
if
i
knew
how
else
i
might
proudly
grapple
with
the
wretch
as
i
of
old
with
grendel
did
but
i
ween
this
war
fire
is
hot
fierce
and
poisonous
therefore
have
i
on
me
shield
and
byrnie
then
did
the
famous
warrior
arise
beside
his
shield
hard
under
helmet
he
bare
the
shirt
under
the
cliffs
of
stone
he
trusted
in
the
strength
of
one
man
nor
is
such
an
expedition
for
a
coward
fiercely
then
did
the
battle
rage
between
hero
and
dragon
but
beowulf
sword
failed
him
in
his
need
and
it
was
like
to
go
ill
with
him
then
when
his
thanes
who
watched
saw
that
fear
fell
upon
them
and
they
fled
one
only
wiglaf
was
his
name
would
not
forsake
his
liege
lord
seizing
his
shield
and
drawing
his
sword
he
cried
come
let
us
go
to
him
let
us
help
our
chieftain
although
the
grim
terror
of
fire
be
hot
but
none
would
follow
him
so
alone
he
went
through
the
fatal
smoke
he
bare
his
war
helmet
to
the
assistance
of
his
lord
fierce
was
the
fight
and
long
but
at
length
the
dragon
lay
dead
beowulf
had
conquered
but
in
conquering
he
had
received
his
death
wound
and
there
by
the
wild
seashore
he
died
and
there
a
sorrowing
people
buried
him
for
him
then
did
the
people
of
the
geáts
prepare
upon
the
earth
a
funeral
pile
strong
hung
round
with
helmets
with
war
boards
and
bright
byrnies
as
he
had
requested
weeping
the
heroes
laid
down
in
the
midst
their
dear
lord
then
began
the
warriors
to
awake
upon
the
hill
the
mightiest
of
the
wood
smoke
rose
aloft
dark
from
the
foe
of
wood
noisily
it
went
mingled
with
weeping
the
people
of
the
westerns
wrought
then
a
mound
over
the
sea
it
was
high
and
broad
easy
to
behold
by
the
sailors
over
the
waves
and
during
ten
days
they
built
up
the
beacon
of
the
renowned
the
mightiest
of
fires
then
round
the
mound
rode
a
troupe
of
beasts
of
war
of
nobles
twelve
in
all
they
would
speak
about
their
king
they
would
call
him
to
mind
they
praised
his
valor
and
his
deeds
of
bravery
they
judged
with
praise
even
as
it
is
fitting
that
a
man
should
extol
his
friendly
lord
should
love
him
in
his
soul
when
he
must
depart
from
the
body
to
become
of
naught
thus
the
people
of
the
geáts
his
hearth
comrades
mourned
their
dear
lord
they
said
that
he
was
of
the
kings
of
the
world
the
mildest
and
gentlest
of
men
the
most
gracious
to
his
people
and
the
most
jealous
of
glory
books
to
read
stories
of
beowulf
by
marshall
beowulf
translated
by
huyshe
chapter
xii
the
father
of
english
song
although
there
are
lines
of
beowulf
which
seem
to
show
that
the
writer
of
the
poem
was
a
christian
they
must
have
been
added
by
some
one
who
copied
or
retold
the
story
long
after
the
saxons
had
come
to
britain
for
the
poet
who
first
told
the
tale
must
have
been
a
heathen
as
all
the
saxons
were
the
britons
were
christian
for
they
had
learned
the
story
of
christ
from
the
romans
but
when
the
saxons
conquered
the
land
they
robbed
and
ruined
the
churches
the
christian
priests
were
slain
or
driven
forth
and
once
more
the
land
became
heathen
then
after
many
years
had
passed
the
story
of
christ
was
again
brought
to
england
this
time
it
came
from
ireland
it
was
brought
from
there
by
columba
who
built
a
church
and
founded
a
monastery
on
the
island
of
iona
and
from
there
his
eager
wandering
priests
carried
the
story
far
and
wide
northward
to
the
fortress
of
the
pictish
kings
and
southward
to
the
wild
saxons
who
dwelt
amid
the
hills
and
uplands
of
northumbria
to
this
story
of
love
and
gentleness
the
wild
heathen
listened
in
wonder
to
help
the
weak
to
love
and
forgive
their
enemies
was
something
unthought
of
by
these
fierce
yet
they
listened
and
believed
once
again
churches
were
built
priests
came
to
live
among
the
people
and
the
sound
of
christian
prayer
and
praise
rose
night
and
morning
from
castle
and
from
hut
for
thirty
years
and
more
columba
the
passionate
and
tender
taught
and
labored
many
monasteries
were
founded
which
became
as
it
were
the
lighthouses
of
learning
and
religion
there
the
monks
and
priests
lived
and
from
them
as
centers
they
traveled
out
in
all
directions
teaching
the
heathen
and
when
at
last
columba
closed
his
tired
eyes
and
folded
his
weary
hands
there
were
many
more
to
carry
on
his
work
then
also
from
rome
as
once
before
the
story
of
christ
was
brought
in
the
year
in
which
columba
died
augustine
landed
with
his
forty
followers
they
too
in
time
reached
northumbria
so
side
by
side
roman
and
celt
spoke
the
message
of
peace
on
earth
goodwill
toward
men
the
wild
saxon
listened
to
this
message
it
is
true
he
took
christianity
for
his
religion
but
it
was
rather
as
if
he
had
put
on
an
outer
dress
his
new
religion
made
little
difference
to
his
life
he
still
loved
fighting
and
war
and
his
songs
were
still
all
of
war
he
worshiped
christ
as
he
had
worshiped
woden
and
looked
upon
him
as
a
hero
only
a
little
more
powerful
than
the
heroes
of
whom
the
minstrels
sang
it
was
difficult
to
teach
the
saxons
the
bible
lessons
which
we
know
so
well
for
in
those
days
there
were
no
bibles
there
were
indeed
few
books
of
any
kind
and
these
few
belonged
to
the
monks
and
priests
they
were
in
latin
and
in
some
of
them
parts
of
the
bible
had
been
translated
into
latin
but
hardly
any
of
the
men
and
women
of
england
could
read
or
understand
these
books
indeed
few
people
could
read
at
all
for
it
was
still
the
listening
time
they
learned
the
history
of
their
country
from
the
songs
of
the
minstrels
and
it
was
in
this
way
too
that
they
came
to
learn
the
bible
stories
for
these
stories
were
made
into
poetry
and
it
was
among
the
rugged
hills
of
northumbria
by
the
rocky
shore
where
the
sounding
waves
beat
and
beat
all
day
long
that
the
first
christian
songs
in
english
were
sung
for
here
it
was
that
caedmon
the
father
of
english
song
lived
and
died
at
whitby
there
was
a
monastery
ruled
over
by
the
abbess
hilda
this
was
a
post
of
great
importance
for
as
you
know
the
monasteries
were
the
schools
and
libraries
of
the
country
and
they
were
the
inns
too
so
all
the
true
life
of
the
land
ebbed
and
flowed
through
the
monasteries
here
priest
and
soldier
student
and
minstrel
prince
and
beggar
came
and
went
here
in
the
great
hall
when
work
was
done
and
the
evening
meal
over
were
gathered
all
the
monks
and
their
guests
here
too
would
gather
the
simple
folk
of
the
countryside
the
fishermen
and
farmers
the
lay
brothers
and
helpers
who
shared
the
work
of
the
monastery
when
the
meal
was
done
the
minstrels
sang
while
proud
and
humble
alike
listened
eagerly
or
perhaps
it
was
agreed
for
the
sake
of
mirth
that
all
present
should
sing
in
their
turn
but
when
at
the
monastery
of
whitby
it
was
agreed
that
all
should
sing
in
turn
there
was
one
among
the
circle
around
the
fire
who
silently
left
his
place
and
crept
away
hanging
his
head
in
shame
this
man
was
called
caedmon
he
could
not
sing
and
although
he
loved
to
listen
to
the
songs
of
others
whenever
he
saw
the
harp
come
near
him
we
are
told
he
arose
out
of
shame
from
the
feast
and
went
home
to
his
house
away
from
the
bright
firelight
out
into
the
lonely
dark
he
crept
with
bent
head
and
lagging
steps
perhaps
he
would
stand
a
moment
outside
the
door
beneath
the
starlight
and
listen
to
the
thunder
of
the
waves
and
the
shriek
of
the
winds
and
as
he
felt
in
his
heart
all
the
beauty
and
wonder
of
the
world
the
glory
and
the
might
of
the
sea
and
sky
he
would
ask
in
dumb
pain
why
when
he
could
feel
it
touch
his
heart
he
could
not
also
sing
of
the
beauty
and
wonder
glory
and
might
one
night
caedmon
crept
away
as
usual
and
went
out
of
the
house
where
the
entertainment
was
to
the
stable
where
he
had
to
take
care
of
the
horses
that
night
he
there
composed
himself
to
rest
a
person
appeared
to
him
then
in
a
dream
and
calling
him
by
name
said
sing
some
song
to
me
he
answered
can
not
sing
for
that
was
the
reason
why
i
left
the
entertainment
and
retired
to
this
place
because
i
can
not
sing
the
other
who
talked
to
him
replied
you
shall
sing
shall
i
sing
rejoined
he
the
beginning
of
created
things
said
the
other
whereupon
he
presently
began
to
sing
verses
to
the
praise
of
god
which
he
had
never
heard
the
purport
whereof
was
thus
must
we
praise
the
guardian
of
heaven
kingdom
the
creator
might
and
his
mind
thought
glorious
father
of
men
as
of
every
wonder
he
lord
eternal
formed
the
beginning
he
first
framed
for
the
children
of
earth
the
heaven
as
a
roof
holy
creator
then
the
guardian
of
mankind
the
eternal
lord
afterwards
produced
the
earth
for
men
lord
almighty
this
says
the
old
historian
who
tells
the
story
in
latin
is
the
sense
but
not
the
words
in
order
as
he
sang
them
in
his
sleep
for
verses
though
never
so
well
composed
can
not
be
literally
that
is
word
for
word
translated
out
of
one
language
into
another
without
losing
much
of
their
beauty
and
loftiness
ecclesiastical
history
awakening
from
his
sleep
caedmon
remembered
all
that
he
had
sung
in
his
dream
and
the
dream
did
not
fade
away
as
most
dreams
do
for
he
found
that
not
only
could
he
sing
these
verses
but
he
who
had
before
been
dumb
and
ashamed
when
the
harp
was
put
into
his
hand
could
now
make
and
sing
more
beautifully
than
could
others
and
all
that
he
sang
was
to
god
glory
in
the
morning
full
of
his
wonderful
new
gift
caedmon
went
to
the
steward
who
was
set
over
him
and
told
him
of
the
vision
that
he
had
had
during
the
night
and
the
steward
greatly
marveling
led
caedmon
to
the
abbess
the
abbess
listened
to
the
strange
tale
then
she
commanded
caedmon
in
the
presence
of
many
learned
men
to
tell
his
dream
and
repeat
the
verses
that
they
might
all
give
their
judgment
what
it
was
and
whence
his
verse
came
so
the
simple
farm
laborer
who
had
no
learning
of
any
kind
sang
while
the
learned
and
grave
men
listened
and
he
who
was
wont
to
creep
away
in
dumb
shame
fearing
the
laughter
of
his
fellows
sang
now
with
such
beauty
and
sweetness
that
they
were
all
of
one
mind
saying
that
the
lord
himself
had
of
his
heavenly
grace
given
to
caedmon
this
new
power
then
these
learned
men
repeated
to
caedmon
some
part
of
the
bible
explained
the
meaning
of
it
and
asked
him
to
tell
it
again
in
poetry
this
caedmon
undertook
to
do
and
when
he
fully
understood
the
words
he
went
away
next
morning
he
returned
and
repeated
all
that
he
had
been
told
but
now
it
was
in
beautiful
poetry
then
the
abbess
saw
that
indeed
the
grace
of
god
had
come
upon
the
man
she
made
him
at
once
give
up
the
life
of
a
servant
which
he
had
been
leading
and
bade
him
become
a
monk
caedmon
gladly
did
her
bidding
and
when
he
had
been
received
among
them
his
brother
monks
taught
to
him
all
the
bible
stories
but
caedmon
could
neither
read
nor
write
nor
is
it
at
all
likely
that
he
ever
learned
to
do
either
even
after
he
became
a
monk
for
we
are
told
that
he
was
well
advanced
in
years
before
his
great
gift
of
song
came
to
him
it
is
quite
certain
that
he
could
not
read
latin
so
that
all
that
he
put
into
verse
had
to
be
taught
to
him
by
some
more
learned
brother
and
some
one
too
must
have
written
down
the
verses
which
caedmon
sang
we
can
imagine
the
pious
humble
monk
listening
while
another
read
and
translated
to
him
out
of
some
latin
missal
he
would
sit
with
clasped
hands
and
earnest
eyes
intent
on
understanding
then
when
he
had
filled
his
mind
with
the
sacred
story
he
would
go
away
by
himself
and
weave
it
into
song
perhaps
he
would
walk
about
beneath
the
glowing
stars
or
by
the
sounding
sea
and
thank
god
that
he
was
no
longer
dumb
and
that
at
last
he
could
say
forth
all
that
before
had
been
shut
within
his
heart
in
an
agony
of
silence
and
we
are
told
his
songs
and
his
verse
were
so
winsome
to
hear
that
his
teachers
themselves
wrote
and
learned
from
his
mouth
thus
caedmon
keeping
in
mind
all
he
heard
and
as
it
were
chewing
the
cud
converted
the
same
into
most
harmonious
verse
and
sweetly
repeating
the
same
made
his
masters
in
their
turn
his
hearers
he
sang
the
creation
of
the
world
the
origin
of
man
and
all
the
history
of
genesis
and
made
many
verses
on
the
departure
of
the
children
of
israel
out
of
egypt
and
their
entering
into
the
land
of
promise
with
many
other
histories
from
holy
writ
as
has
been
said
there
are
lines
in
beowulf
which
seem
to
have
been
written
by
a
christian
but
all
that
is
christian
in
it
is
merely
of
the
outside
it
could
easily
be
taken
away
and
the
poem
would
remain
perfect
the
whole
feeling
of
the
poem
is
not
christian
but
pagan
so
it
would
seem
that
what
is
christian
in
it
has
been
added
long
after
the
poem
was
first
made
yet
added
before
the
people
had
forgotten
their
pagan
ways
for
very
long
after
they
became
christian
the
saxons
kept
their
old
pagan
ways
of
thought
and
caedmon
when
he
came
to
sing
of
holy
things
sang
as
a
minstrel
might
to
him
abraham
and
moses
and
all
the
holy
men
of
old
were
like
the
warrior
chieftains
whom
he
knew
and
of
whom
the
minstrels
sang
and
god
to
him
was
but
the
greatest
of
these
warriors
he
is
heaven
chief
the
great
prince
the
clash
and
clang
of
sword
and
trumpet
calls
are
heard
amid
the
grim
clash
of
helms
war
filled
the
greatest
half
of
life
all
history
all
poetry
were
bound
up
in
it
caedmon
sang
of
what
he
saw
of
what
he
knew
he
was
christian
he
had
learned
the
lesson
of
peace
on
earth
but
he
lived
amid
the
clash
of
arms
and
sang
them
chapter
xiii
how
caedmon
sang
and
how
he
fell
once
more
on
silence
one
of
caedmon
poems
is
call
the
genesis
in
this
the
poet
begins
by
telling
of
how
satan
in
his
pride
rebelled
against
god
and
of
how
he
was
cast
forth
from
heaven
with
all
those
who
had
joined
with
him
in
rebelling
this
story
of
the
war
in
heaven
and
of
the
angels
fall
is
not
in
the
bible
it
is
not
to
be
found
either
in
any
of
the
latin
books
which
the
monks
of
whitby
may
have
had
the
story
did
not
come
from
rome
but
from
the
east
how
then
did
caedmon
hear
it
whitby
we
must
remember
was
founded
by
celtic
and
not
by
roman
monks
it
was
founded
by
monks
who
came
from
ireland
to
iona
and
from
thence
to
northumbria
to
them
the
teaching
of
christ
had
come
from
jerusalem
and
the
east
rather
than
from
rome
so
here
again
perhaps
we
can
see
the
effect
of
the
celts
on
our
literature
it
was
from
celtic
monks
that
caedmon
heard
the
story
of
the
war
in
heaven
after
telling
of
this
war
caedmon
goes
on
to
relate
how
the
wicked
angels
into
darkness
urged
them
their
darksome
way
they
might
not
loudly
laugh
but
they
in
dwelt
accursed
and
woe
they
knew
pain
and
sorrow
torment
endured
with
darkness
decked
hard
retribution
for
that
they
had
devised
against
god
to
war
then
after
all
the
fierce
clash
of
battle
come
a
few
lines
which
seem
like
peace
after
war
quiet
after
storm
then
was
after
as
before
peace
in
heaven
thanes
the
lord
dear
to
all
then
god
grieved
at
the
empty
spaces
in
heaven
from
whence
the
wicked
angels
had
been
driven
forth
and
that
they
might
at
last
be
filled
again
he
made
the
world
and
placed
a
man
and
woman
there
this
to
the
chief
of
the
fallen
angels
was
grief
and
pain
and
his
heart
boiled
within
him
in
anger
heaven
is
lost
to
us
he
cried
but
now
that
we
may
not
have
it
let
us
so
act
that
it
shall
be
lost
to
them
also
let
us
make
them
disobey
god
then
with
them
will
he
be
wroth
of
mind
will
cast
them
from
his
favor
then
shall
they
seek
this
hell
and
these
grim
depths
then
may
we
have
them
to
ourselves
as
vassals
the
children
of
men
in
this
fast
durance
then
satan
asks
who
will
help
him
to
tempt
mankind
to
do
wrong
if
to
any
followers
i
princely
treasure
gave
of
old
while
we
in
that
good
realm
happy
sate
let
him
my
gift
repay
let
him
now
aid
me
so
one
of
satan
followers
made
himself
ready
on
his
head
the
chief
his
helmet
set
and
he
wheeled
up
from
thence
departed
through
the
doors
of
hell
lionlike
in
air
in
hostile
mood
dashed
the
fire
aside
with
a
fiend
power
caedmon
next
tells
how
the
fiend
tempted
first
the
man
and
then
the
woman
with
guileful
lies
to
eat
of
the
fruit
which
had
been
forbidden
to
them
and
how
eve
yielded
to
him
and
having
eaten
of
the
forbidden
fruit
eve
urged
adam
too
to
eat
for
it
seemed
to
her
that
a
fair
new
life
was
open
to
her
i
see
angels
she
said
encompass
him
with
feathery
wings
of
all
folk
greatest
of
bands
most
joyous
i
can
hear
from
far
and
so
widely
see
through
the
whole
world
over
the
broad
creation
i
can
the
joy
of
the
firmament
hear
in
heaven
it
became
light
to
me
in
mind
from
without
and
within
after
the
fruit
i
tasted
and
thus
urged
by
eve
adam
too
ate
of
the
forbidden
fruit
and
the
man
and
woman
were
driven
out
of
the
happy
garden
and
the
curse
fell
upon
them
because
of
their
disobedience
so
they
went
forth
into
a
narrower
life
yet
there
was
left
to
them
the
roof
adorned
with
holy
stars
and
earth
to
them
her
ample
riches
gave
in
many
places
this
poem
is
only
a
paraphrase
of
the
bible
a
paraphrase
means
the
same
thing
said
in
other
words
but
in
other
places
the
poet
seems
to
forget
his
model
and
sings
out
of
his
own
heart
then
his
song
is
best
perhaps
some
of
the
most
beautiful
lines
are
those
which
tell
of
the
dove
that
noah
sent
forth
from
the
ark
then
after
seven
nights
he
from
the
ark
let
forth
a
palid
dove
to
fly
after
the
swart
raven
over
the
deep
water
to
quest
whether
the
foaming
sea
had
of
the
green
earth
yet
any
part
laid
bare
wide
she
flew
seeking
her
own
will
far
she
flew
yet
found
no
rest
because
of
the
flood
with
her
feet
she
might
not
perch
on
land
nor
on
the
tree
leaves
light
for
the
steep
mountain
tops
were
whelmed
in
waters
then
the
wild
bird
went
at
eventide
the
ark
to
seek
over
the
darling
wave
she
flew
weary
to
sink
hungry
to
the
hands
of
the
holy
man
a
second
time
the
dove
is
sent
forth
and
this
is
how
the
poet
tells
of
it
far
and
wide
she
flew
glad
in
flying
free
till
she
found
a
place
on
a
gentle
tree
gay
of
mood
she
was
and
glad
since
she
sorely
tired
now
could
settle
down
on
the
branches
of
the
tree
on
its
beamy
mast
then
she
fluttered
feathers
went
a
flying
off
again
with
her
booty
flew
brought
it
to
the
sailor
from
an
olive
tree
a
twig
right
into
his
hands
brought
the
blade
of
green
then
the
chief
of
seamen
knew
that
gladness
was
at
hand
and
he
sent
forth
after
three
weeks
the
wild
dove
who
came
not
back
again
for
she
saw
the
land
of
the
greening
trees
the
happy
creature
all
rejoicing
would
no
longer
of
the
ark
for
she
needed
it
no
more
brooke
besides
genesis
many
other
poems
were
thought
at
one
time
to
have
been
made
by
caedmon
the
chief
of
these
are
exodus
and
daniel
they
are
all
in
an
old
book
called
the
junian
from
the
name
of
the
man
francis
dujon
who
first
published
them
the
was
found
among
some
other
old
books
in
trinity
college
dublin
and
given
to
francis
dujon
he
published
the
poems
in
and
it
is
from
that
time
that
we
date
our
knowledge
of
caedmon
wise
men
tell
us
that
caedmon
could
not
have
made
any
of
these
poems
not
even
the
genesis
of
which
you
have
been
reading
but
if
caedmon
did
not
make
these
very
poems
he
made
others
like
them
which
have
been
lost
it
was
he
who
first
showed
the
way
and
other
poets
followed
we
need
not
wonder
perhaps
that
our
poetry
is
a
splendor
of
the
world
when
we
remember
that
it
is
rooted
in
these
grand
old
tales
and
that
it
awoke
to
life
through
the
singing
of
a
strong
son
of
the
soil
a
herdsman
and
a
poet
we
know
very
little
of
this
first
of
english
poets
but
what
we
do
know
makes
us
love
him
he
must
have
been
a
gentle
humble
kindly
man
tender
of
heart
and
pure
of
mind
of
his
birth
we
know
nothing
of
his
life
little
except
the
story
which
has
been
told
and
when
death
came
to
him
he
met
it
cheerfully
as
he
had
lived
for
some
days
he
had
been
ill
but
able
still
to
walk
and
talk
but
one
night
feeling
that
the
end
of
life
for
him
was
near
he
asked
the
brothers
to
give
to
him
for
the
last
time
the
eucharist
or
sacrament
of
the
lord
supper
they
answered
need
of
the
eucharist
for
you
are
not
likely
to
die
since
you
talk
so
merrily
with
us
as
if
you
were
in
perfect
health
said
he
me
the
eucharist
having
received
the
same
into
his
hand
he
asked
whether
they
were
all
in
charity
with
him
and
without
any
enmity
or
rancour
they
answered
that
they
were
all
in
perfect
charity
and
free
from
anger
and
in
their
turn
asked
him
whether
he
was
in
the
same
mind
towards
them
he
answered
am
in
charity
my
children
with
all
the
servants
of
god
then
strengthening
himself
with
the
heavenly
viaticum
he
prepared
for
the
entrance
into
another
life
and
asked
how
near
the
time
was
when
the
brothers
were
to
be
awakened
to
sing
the
nocturnal
praises
of
our
lord
eucharist
given
to
the
dying
they
answered
is
not
far
off
then
he
said
let
us
wait
that
hour
and
signing
himself
with
the
sign
of
the
cross
he
laid
his
head
on
the
pillow
and
falling
into
a
slumber
ended
his
life
so
in
silence
thus
his
life
which
had
been
begun
in
silence
ended
also
in
silence
with
just
a
few
singing
years
between
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
as
he
had
served
god
with
a
simple
and
pure
mind
and
undisturbed
devotion
so
he
now
departed
to
his
presence
leaving
the
world
by
a
quiet
death
and
that
tongue
which
had
composed
so
many
holy
words
in
praise
of
the
creator
uttered
its
last
words
while
he
was
in
the
act
of
signing
himself
with
a
cross
and
recommending
himself
into
his
hands

chapter
xiv
the
father
of
english
history
while
caedmon
was
still
singing
at
whitby
in
another
northumbrian
village
named
jarrow
a
boy
was
born
this
boy
we
know
as
bede
and
when
he
was
seven
years
old
his
friends
gave
him
into
the
keeping
of
the
abbot
of
wearmouth
under
this
abbot
there
were
two
monasteries
the
one
at
jarrow
and
the
other
at
wearmouth
a
few
miles
distant
and
in
these
two
monasteries
bede
spent
all
the
rest
of
his
life
when
bede
was
eight
years
old
caedmon
died
and
although
the
little
boy
had
never
met
the
great
but
humble
poet
he
must
have
heard
of
him
and
it
is
from
bede
history
that
we
learn
all
that
we
know
of
caedmon
there
is
almost
as
little
to
tell
of
bede
life
as
of
caedmon
he
passed
it
peacefully
reading
writing
and
teaching
within
the
walls
of
his
beloved
monastery
but
without
the
walls
wars
often
raged
for
england
was
at
this
time
still
divided
into
several
kingdoms
whose
kings
often
fought
against
each
other
bede
loved
to
learn
even
when
he
was
a
boy
we
know
this
for
long
afterward
another
learned
man
told
his
pupils
to
take
bede
for
an
example
and
not
spend
their
time
digging
out
foxes
and
coursing
hares
and
when
he
became
a
man
he
was
one
of
the
most
learned
of
his
time
and
wrote
books
on
nearly
every
subject
that
was
then
thought
worth
writing
about
plummer
once
when
bede
was
still
a
boy
a
fearful
plague
swept
the
land
killing
and
destroying
a
great
multitude
of
men
in
the
monastery
of
jarrow
all
who
could
read
or
preach
or
sing
were
killed
by
it
only
the
abbot
himself
and
a
little
lad
were
left
the
abbot
loved
services
and
the
praises
of
the
church
his
heart
was
heavy
with
grief
and
mourning
for
the
loss
of
his
friends
it
was
heavy
too
with
the
thought
that
the
services
of
his
church
could
no
longer
be
made
beautiful
with
song
for
a
few
days
the
abbot
read
the
services
all
alone
but
at
the
end
of
a
week
he
could
no
longer
bear
the
lack
of
singing
so
calling
the
little
lad
he
bade
him
to
help
him
and
to
chant
the
responses
the
story
calls
up
to
us
a
strange
picture
there
stands
the
great
monastery
all
its
rooms
empty
along
its
passages
the
footsteps
of
the
man
and
boy
echo
strangely
they
reach
the
chapel
vast
and
dim
and
there
before
the
great
altar
with
its
gleaming
lights
the
abbot
in
his
robes
chants
the
services
but
where
the
voices
of
choir
and
people
were
wont
to
join
there
sounds
only
the
clear
high
voice
of
one
little
boy
that
little
boy
was
bede
and
thus
night
and
morning
the
sound
of
prayer
and
praise
rose
from
the
deserted
chapel
until
the
force
of
the
plague
had
spent
itself
and
it
was
once
more
possible
to
find
men
to
take
the
places
of
those
singers
who
had
died
so
the
years
passed
on
until
when
bede
was
thirty
years
of
age
he
became
a
priest
he
might
have
been
made
an
abbot
had
he
wished
but
he
refused
to
be
taken
away
from
his
beloved
books
the
office
he
said
demands
household
care
and
household
care
brings
with
it
distraction
of
mind
hindering
the
pursuit
of
learning
morley
english
writers
bede
wrote
many
books
but
it
is
by
his
ecclesiastical
history
that
is
church
history
that
we
remember
him
best
as
caedmon
is
called
the
father
of
english
poetry
bede
is
called
the
father
of
english
history
but
it
is
well
to
remember
that
caedmon
wrote
in
and
bede
in
latin
there
were
others
who
wrote
history
before
bede
but
he
was
perhaps
the
first
who
wrote
history
in
the
right
spirit
he
did
not
write
in
order
to
make
a
good
minstrel
tale
he
tried
to
tell
the
truth
he
was
careful
as
to
where
he
got
his
facts
and
careful
how
he
used
them
so
those
who
came
after
him
could
trust
him
bede
history
you
remember
was
one
of
the
books
which
layamon
used
when
he
wrote
his
brut
and
in
it
we
find
many
of
the
stories
of
early
british
history
which
have
grown
familiar
to
us
it
is
in
this
book
that
we
find
the
story
of
how
gregory
saw
the
pretty
children
in
the
roman
slave
market
and
of
how
for
love
of
their
fair
faces
he
sent
augustine
to
teach
the
heathen
saxons
about
christ
there
are
too
many
stories
in
it
of
how
the
saxons
became
christian
one
of
the
most
interesting
perhaps
is
about
edwin
king
of
northumbria
edwin
had
married
a
christian
princess
ethelberga
sister
of
eadbald
king
of
kent
eadbald
was
at
first
unwilling
that
his
sister
should
marry
a
pagan
king
but
edwin
promised
that
he
would
not
try
to
turn
her
from
her
religion
and
that
she
and
all
who
came
with
her
should
be
allowed
to
worship
what
god
they
chose
so
the
princess
ethelberga
came
to
be
queen
of
northumbria
and
with
her
she
brought
paulinus
a
man
beloved
of
god
as
priest
he
came
to
help
her
to
keep
faithful
among
a
heathen
people
and
in
the
hope
too
that
he
might
be
able
to
turn
the
pagan
king
and
his
folk
to
the
true
faith
and
in
this
hope
he
was
not
disappointed
by
degrees
king
edwin
began
to
think
much
about
the
christian
faith
he
gave
up
worshipping
idols
and
although
he
did
not
at
once
become
christian
he
often
sat
alone
with
silent
lips
while
in
his
inmost
heart
he
argued
much
with
himself
considering
what
was
best
to
do
and
what
religion
he
should
hold
to
at
last
the
king
decided
to
call
a
council
of
his
wise
men
and
to
ask
each
one
what
he
thought
of
this
new
teaching
and
when
they
were
all
gathered
coifi
the
chief
priest
spoke
king
he
said
what
this
is
which
is
now
preached
to
us
for
i
verily
declare
to
you
that
the
religion
which
we
have
hitherto
professed
has
as
far
as
i
can
learn
no
virtue
in
it
for
none
of
your
people
has
applied
himself
more
diligently
to
the
worship
of
our
gods
than
i
and
yet
there
are
many
who
receive
greater
favors
from
you
and
are
more
preferred
than
i
and
are
more
prosperous
in
their
undertakings
now
if
the
gods
were
good
for
anything
they
would
rather
forward
me
who
have
been
more
careful
to
serve
them
it
remains
therefore
that
if
upon
examination
you
find
those
new
doctrines
which
are
now
preached
to
us
better
and
more
efficacious
we
immediately
receive
them
without
delay
another
of
the
king
chief
men
approving
of
his
words
and
exhortations
presently
added
present
life
of
man
o
king
seems
to
me
in
comparison
of
that
time
which
is
unknown
to
us
like
to
the
swift
flight
of
a
sparrow
through
the
room
wherein
you
sit
at
supper
in
winter
with
your
commanders
and
ministers
and
a
good
fire
in
the
midst
while
the
storms
of
rain
and
snow
prevail
abroad
the
sparrow
i
say
flying
in
at
one
door
and
immediately
out
at
another
whilst
he
is
within
is
safe
from
the
wintry
storm
but
after
a
short
space
of
fair
weather
he
immediately
vanishes
out
of
your
sight
into
the
dark
winter
from
whence
he
had
emerged
so
this
life
of
man
appears
for
a
short
space
but
of
what
went
before
or
what
is
to
follow
we
are
utterly
ignorant
if
therefore
this
new
doctrine
contains
something
more
certain
it
seems
justly
to
deserve
to
be
followed
others
of
the
king
wise
men
and
counselors
spoke
and
they
all
spoke
to
the
same
end
coifi
then
said
that
he
would
hear
yet
more
of
what
paulinus
had
to
tell
so
paulinus
rose
from
his
place
and
told
the
people
more
of
the
story
of
christ
and
after
listening
attentively
for
some
time
coifi
again
cried
out
advise
o
king
that
we
instantly
abjure
and
set
fire
to
those
temples
and
altars
which
we
have
consecrated
without
reaping
any
benefit
from
them
in
short
the
king
publicly
gave
his
license
to
paulinus
to
preach
the
gospel
and
renouncing
idolatry
declared
that
he
received
the
faith
of
christ
and
when
he
inquired
of
the
high
priest
who
should
first
profane
the
altars
and
temples
of
their
idols
with
the
enclosures
that
were
about
them
coifi
answered
for
who
can
more
properly
than
myself
destroy
those
things
which
i
worshiped
through
ignorance
for
an
example
to
all
others
through
the
wisdom
which
has
been
given
me
by
the
true
god
then
immediately
in
contempt
of
his
former
superstitions
he
desired
the
king
to
furnish
him
with
arms
and
a
stallion
and
mounting
the
same
he
set
out
to
destroy
the
idols
for
it
was
not
lawful
before
for
the
high
priest
either
to
carry
arms
or
to
ride
upon
any
but
a
mare
having
therefore
girt
a
sword
about
him
with
a
spear
in
his
hand
he
mounted
the
king
stallion
and
proceeded
to
the
idols
the
multitude
beholding
it
concluded
he
was
distracted
but
he
lost
no
time
for
as
soon
as
he
drew
near
the
temple
he
profaned
the
same
casting
into
it
the
spear
which
he
held
and
rejoicing
in
the
knowledge
of
the
worship
of
the
true
god
he
commanded
his
companions
to
destroy
the
temple
with
all
its
enclosures
by
fire
giles
translation
of
ecclesiastical
history
one
of
the
reasons
why
i
have
chosen
this
story
out
of
history
is
because
it
contains
the
picture
of
the
sparrow
flitting
through
the
firelit
room
out
of
the
dark
and
cold
it
comes
into
the
light
and
warmth
for
a
moment
and
then
vanishes
into
the
dark
and
cold
once
more
the
saxon
who
more
than
thirteen
hundred
years
ago
made
that
was
a
poet
he
did
not
know
it
perhaps
he
was
only
speaking
of
what
he
had
often
seen
telling
in
simple
words
of
something
that
happened
almost
every
day
and
yet
he
has
given
us
a
picture
which
we
can
not
forget
and
has
made
our
literature
by
so
much
the
richer
he
has
told
us
of
something
too
which
helps
us
to
realize
the
rough
life
our
forefathers
lived
even
in
the
king
palace
the
windows
were
without
glass
the
doors
stood
open
to
let
out
the
smoke
from
the
good
fire
in
the
midst
for
there
were
no
chimneys
or
at
best
but
a
hole
in
the
roof
to
serve
as
one
the
doors
stood
open
even
though
the
storms
of
snow
and
rain
prevailed
abroad
and
in
spite
of
the
good
fire
it
must
have
been
comfortless
enough
yet
many
a
stray
bird
might
well
be
drawn
thither
by
the
light
and
warmth
bede
lived
a
peaceful
busy
life
and
when
he
came
to
die
his
end
was
peaceful
too
and
his
work
ceased
only
with
his
death
one
of
his
pupils
writing
to
a
friend
tells
of
these
last
hours
are
from
a
letter
of
cuthbert
afterwards
abbot
of
wearmouth
and
jarrow
to
his
friend
cuthwin
for
some
weeks
in
the
bright
springtime
of
bede
had
been
ill
yet
cheerful
and
rejoicing
giving
thanks
to
almighty
god
every
day
and
night
yea
every
hour
daily
too
he
continued
to
give
lessons
to
his
pupils
and
the
rest
of
the
time
he
spent
in
singing
psalms
i
can
with
truth
declare
that
i
never
saw
with
my
eyes
or
heard
with
my
ears
any
one
return
thanks
so
unceasingly
to
the
living
god
says
the
letter
during
these
days
he
labored
to
compose
two
works
well
worthy
to
be
remembered
besides
the
lessons
we
had
from
him
and
singing
of
psalms
that
is
he
translated
the
gospel
of
john
as
far
as
the
words
what
are
these
among
so
many
into
our
own
tongue
for
the
benefit
of
the
church
and
some
collections
out
of
the
book
of
notes
of
bishop
isidor
when
the
tuesday
before
the
ascension
of
our
lord
came
he
began
to
suffer
still
more
in
his
health
but
he
passed
all
that
day
and
dictated
cheerfully
and
now
and
then
among
other
things
said
on
quickly
i
know
not
how
long
i
shall
hold
out
and
whether
my
maker
will
not
soon
take
me
away
but
to
us
he
seemed
very
well
to
know
the
time
of
his
departure
and
so
he
spent
the
night
awake
in
thanksgiving
and
when
the
morning
appeared
that
is
wednesday
he
ordered
us
to
write
with
all
speed
what
he
had
begun
there
was
one
of
us
with
him
who
said
to
him
dear
master
there
is
still
one
chapter
wanting
do
you
think
it
troublesome
to
be
asked
any
more
questions
he
answered
is
no
trouble
take
your
pen
and
make
ready
and
write
fast
then
the
same
boy
said
once
more
master
there
is
yet
one
sentence
not
written
and
he
said
then
write
it
and
after
a
little
space
the
boy
said
it
is
finished
and
he
answered
thou
hast
spoken
truth
it
is
finished
receive
my
head
into
your
hands
for
it
is
a
great
satisfaction
to
me
to
sit
facing
my
holy
place
where
i
was
wont
to
pray
that
i
may
also
sitting
call
upon
my
father
and
sitting
upon
the
pavement
of
his
little
cell
he
sang
glory
be
to
the
father
and
to
the
son
and
to
the
holy
ghost
when
he
had
named
the
holy
ghost
he
breathed
his
last
and
departed
to
the
heavenly
kingdom
so
died
bede
surnamed
the
venerable
we
have
come
to
think
of
venerable
as
meaning
very
old
but
bede
was
only
when
he
died
and
venerable
here
means
rather
greatly
to
be
honored
there
are
two
or
three
stories
about
how
bede
came
to
be
given
his
surname
one
tells
how
a
young
monk
was
set
to
write
some
lines
of
poetry
to
be
put
upon
the
tomb
where
his
master
was
buried
he
tried
hard
but
the
verse
would
not
come
right
he
could
not
get
the
proper
number
of
syllables
in
his
lines
in
this
grave
lie
the
bones
of
bede
he
wrote
but
he
could
not
find
an
adjective
that
would
make
the
line
the
right
length
try
how
he
might
at
last
wearied
out
he
fell
asleep
over
his
task
then
as
he
slept
an
angel
bent
down
and
taking
the
pen
from
the
monk
tired
fingers
wrote
the
words
the
venerable
so
that
the
line
ran
in
this
grave
lie
the
bones
of
the
venerable
bede
and
thus
for
all
time
our
first
great
historian
is
known
as
the
venerable
bede
book
to
read
the
ecclesiastical
history
of
the
english
nation
by
bede
translated
by
giles
chapter
xv
how
alfred
the
great
fought
with
his
pen
while
caedmon
sang
his
english
lays
and
bede
wrote
his
latin
books
northumbria
had
grown
into
a
center
not
only
of
english
learning
but
of
learning
for
western
europe
the
abbots
of
jarrow
and
wearmouth
made
journeys
to
rome
and
brought
back
with
them
precious
mss
for
the
monastery
libraries
scholars
from
all
parts
of
europe
came
to
visit
the
northumbrian
monasteries
or
sent
thither
for
teachers
but
before
many
years
had
passed
all
that
was
changed
times
of
war
and
trouble
were
not
yet
over
for
england
once
again
heathen
hordes
fell
upon
our
shores
the
danes
fierce
and
lawless
carrying
sword
and
firebrand
wherever
they
passed
leaving
death
and
ruin
in
their
track
surged
over
the
land
the
monasteries
were
ruined
the
scholars
were
scattered
a
life
of
peaceful
study
was
no
longer
possible
the
learning
of
two
hundred
years
was
swept
away
the
lamp
of
knowledge
lit
by
the
monks
grew
dim
and
flickered
out
but
when
sixty
years
or
more
had
passed
a
king
arose
who
crushed
the
danish
power
and
who
once
more
lit
that
lamp
this
king
was
alfred
the
great
history
tells
us
how
he
fought
the
danes
how
he
despaired
and
how
he
took
heart
again
and
how
he
at
last
conquered
his
enemies
and
brought
peace
to
his
people
alfred
was
great
in
war
he
was
no
less
great
in
peace
as
he
fought
the
danes
with
the
sword
so
he
fought
ignorance
with
his
pen
he
loved
books
and
he
longed
to
bring
back
to
england
something
of
the
learning
which
had
been
lost
nor
did
he
want
to
keep
learning
for
a
few
only
he
wanted
all
his
people
to
get
the
good
of
it
and
so
as
most
good
books
were
written
in
latin
which
only
a
few
could
read
he
began
to
translate
some
of
them
into
english
in
the
beginning
of
one
of
them
alfred
says
there
are
only
a
few
on
this
side
of
the
humber
who
can
understand
the
divine
service
or
even
explain
a
latin
epistle
in
english
and
i
believe
not
many
on
the
other
side
of
the
humber
either
but
they
are
so
few
that
indeed
i
can
not
remember
one
south
of
the
thames
when
i
began
to
reign
by
this
side
of
the
humber
alfred
means
the
south
side
for
now
the
center
of
learning
was
no
longer
northumbria
but
wessex
alfred
translated
many
books
he
translated
books
of
geography
history
and
religion
and
it
is
from
alfred
that
our
english
prose
dates
just
as
english
poetry
dates
from
caedmon
for
you
must
remember
that
although
we
call
bede
the
father
of
english
history
he
wrote
in
latin
for
the
most
part
and
what
he
wrote
in
english
has
been
lost
besides
writing
himself
alfred
encouraged
his
people
to
write
he
also
caused
a
national
chronicle
to
be
written
a
chronicle
is
the
simplest
form
of
history
the
old
chronicles
did
not
weave
their
history
into
stories
they
simply
put
down
a
date
and
something
that
happened
on
that
date
they
gave
no
reasons
for
things
they
expressed
no
feelings
no
thoughts
so
the
chronicles
can
hardly
be
called
literature
they
were
not
meant
to
be
looked
upon
as
literature
the
writers
of
them
used
them
rather
as
keys
to
memory
they
kept
all
the
stories
in
their
memories
and
the
sight
of
the
name
of
a
king
or
of
a
battle
was
enough
to
unlock
their
store
of
words
and
as
they
told
their
tales
if
they
forgot
a
part
they
made
something
up
just
as
the
minstrels
did
alfred
caused
the
chronicle
to
be
written
up
from
such
books
and
records
as
he
had
from
the
coming
of
the
romans
until
the
time
in
which
he
himself
reigned
and
from
then
onwards
to
the
time
of
the
death
of
king
stephen
the
saxon
chronicle
was
kept
it
is
now
one
of
the
most
useful
books
from
which
we
can
learn
the
history
of
those
times
sometimes
especially
at
the
beginning
the
record
is
very
scant
as
a
rule
there
is
not
more
than
one
short
sentence
for
a
year
sometimes
not
even
that
but
merely
a
date
it
is
like
this
year
in
this
year
severus
succeeded
to
the
empire
and
reigned
seventeen
winters
he
begirt
britain
with
a
dike
from
sea
to
sea
year
year
year
in
this
year
was
found
the
holy
rood
and
so
on
it
goes
and
every
now
and
again
among
entries
which
seem
to
us
of
little
or
no
importance
we
learn
something
that
throws
great
light
on
our
past
history
and
when
we
come
to
the
time
of
alfred
reign
the
entries
are
much
more
full
from
the
chronicle
we
learn
a
great
deal
about
his
wars
with
the
danes
and
of
how
he
fought
them
both
by
land
and
by
sea
the
saxon
chronicle
as
it
extended
over
many
hundred
years
was
of
course
written
by
many
different
people
and
so
parts
of
it
are
written
much
better
than
other
parts
sometimes
we
find
a
writer
who
does
more
than
merely
set
down
facts
who
seems
to
have
a
feeling
for
how
he
tells
his
story
and
who
tries
to
make
the
thing
he
writes
about
living
sometimes
a
writer
even
breaks
into
song
besides
causing
the
chronicle
to
be
written
alfred
translated
bede
history
into
english
and
so
that
all
might
learn
the
history
of
their
land
he
rebuilt
the
ruined
monasteries
and
opened
schools
in
them
once
more
there
he
ordered
that
every
youth
in
the
kingdom
who
has
the
means
shall
attend
to
his
book
so
long
as
he
have
no
other
business
till
he
can
read
english
perfectly
to
boethius
pastoral
care
translated
into
english
by
alfred
alfred
died
after
having
reigned
for
nearly
thirty
years
much
that
he
had
done
seemed
to
die
with
him
for
once
again
the
danes
descended
upon
our
coasts
once
again
they
conquered
and
canute
the
dane
became
king
of
england
but
the
english
spirit
was
strong
and
the
danish
invasion
has
left
scarcely
a
trace
upon
our
language
nor
did
the
danish
power
last
long
for
in
we
had
in
edward
the
confessor
an
english
king
once
more
but
he
was
english
only
in
name
in
truth
he
was
more
than
half
french
and
under
him
french
forces
began
already
to
work
on
our
literature
a
few
years
later
that
french
force
became
overwhelming
for
in
william
of
normandy
came
to
our
shores
and
with
his
coming
it
seemed
for
a
time
as
if
the
life
of
english
literature
was
to
be
crushed
out
forever
only
by
the
chronicle
were
both
prose
and
poetry
kept
alive
in
the
english
tongue
and
it
is
to
alfred
the
great
that
we
owe
this
slender
thread
which
binds
our
english
literature
of
with
the
literature
of
a
thousand
years
ago
chapter
xvi
when
english
slept
william
came
the
sea
with
bloody
sword
came
he
cold
heart
and
bloody
sword
hand
now
rule
the
english
land
the
heimskringla
william
the
norman
ruled
england
norman
knights
and
nobles
filled
all
the
posts
of
honor
at
court
all
the
great
places
in
the
land
norman
bishops
and
abbots
ruled
in
church
and
monastery
the
norman
tongue
was
alone
the
speech
in
court
and
hall
latin
alone
was
the
speech
of
the
learned
only
among
the
lowly
the
unlearned
and
the
poor
was
english
heard
it
seemed
as
if
the
english
tongue
was
doomed
to
vanish
before
the
conquering
norman
even
as
the
ancient
british
tongue
had
vanished
before
the
conquering
english
and
in
truth
for
two
hundred
years
it
might
have
been
thought
that
english
prose
was
dead
put
to
sleep
by
the
sword
but
it
was
not
so
it
slept
indeed
but
to
awake
again
for
england
conquered
the
conqueror
and
when
english
literature
awoke
once
more
it
was
the
richer
through
the
gifts
which
the
norman
had
brought
one
thing
the
normans
had
brought
was
a
liking
for
history
and
soon
there
sprang
up
a
whole
race
of
chroniclers
they
like
bede
were
monks
and
priests
they
lived
in
monasteries
and
wrote
in
latin
one
after
another
they
wrote
and
when
one
laid
down
his
pen
another
took
it
up
some
of
these
chroniclers
were
mere
painstaking
men
who
noted
facts
and
dates
with
care
but
others
were
true
writers
of
literature
who
told
their
tales
in
vivid
stirring
words
so
that
they
make
these
times
live
again
for
us
the
names
of
some
of
the
best
of
these
chroniclers
are
eadmer
orderic
vitalis
and
william
of
malmesbury
by
degrees
these
norman
and
monks
became
filled
with
the
spirit
of
england
they
wrote
of
england
as
of
their
home
they
were
proud
to
call
themselves
english
and
they
began
to
desire
that
england
should
stand
high
among
the
nations
it
is
you
remember
from
one
of
these
chroniclers
geoffrey
of
monmout
see
chapter
vi
that
we
date
the
reawakening
of
in
england
as
a
writer
of
history
geoffrey
is
bad
another
says
of
him
therefore
as
in
all
things
we
trust
bede
whose
wisdom
and
truth
are
not
to
be
doubted
so
that
fabler
with
his
fables
shall
be
forthwith
spat
out
by
us
all
of
newbury
but
if
geoffrey
was
a
bad
writer
of
history
he
was
good
as
a
fabler
and
as
we
have
seen
in
chapter
it
was
to
his
book
that
we
owe
the
first
long
poem
written
in
english
after
the
conquest
the
norman
came
with
sword
in
hand
bringing
in
his
train
the
chroniclers
but
he
did
not
bring
these
alone
he
brought
minstrels
also
besides
the
quiet
monks
who
sat
in
their
little
cells
or
in
the
pleasant
cloisters
writing
the
history
of
the
times
there
were
the
minstrels
who
roamed
the
land
with
harp
and
song
the
man
who
struck
the
first
blow
at
hastings
was
a
minstrel
who
as
he
rode
against
the
english
sang
and
the
song
he
sang
was
of
roland
the
great
champion
of
charlemagne
the
roland
story
is
to
france
what
the
arthur
story
is
to
us
and
it
shows
perhaps
the
strength
of
english
patriotic
spirit
that
that
story
never
took
hold
of
english
minds
some
few
tales
there
are
told
of
roland
in
english
but
they
are
few
indeed
in
comparison
with
the
many
that
are
told
of
arthur
the
norman
however
who
did
not
readily
invent
new
tales
was
very
good
at
taking
and
making
his
own
the
tales
of
others
so
even
as
he
conquered
england
by
the
sword
he
conquered
our
literature
too
for
the
stories
of
arthur
were
told
in
french
before
they
came
back
to
us
in
english
it
was
the
same
with
other
tales
and
many
of
our
old
stories
have
come
down
to
us
not
through
their
english
originals
but
through
the
french
for
the
years
after
the
conquest
are
the
poorest
in
english
literature
from
the
conquest
until
layamon
wrote
his
brut
there
was
no
english
literature
worthy
of
the
name
had
we
not
already
spoken
of
layamon
out
of
true
order
in
following
the
story
of
arthur
it
is
here
that
we
should
speak
of
him
and
of
his
book
the
brut
so
perhaps
it
would
be
well
to
go
back
and
read
chapter
and
then
we
must
go
on
to
the
metrical
romances
the
three
hundred
years
from
to
were
the
years
of
the
metrical
romances
metrical
means
written
in
verse
romance
meant
at
first
the
languages
made
from
the
latin
tongue
such
as
french
or
spanish
after
a
time
the
word
romance
was
used
to
mean
a
story
told
in
any
romance
language
but
now
we
use
it
to
mean
any
story
of
strange
and
wonderful
adventures
especially
when
the
most
thrilling
adventures
happen
to
the
hero
and
heroine
the
norman
minstrels
then
took
english
tales
and
made
them
into
romances
but
when
the
english
began
once
more
to
write
they
turned
these
romances
back
again
into
english
we
still
call
them
romances
although
they
are
now
written
in
english
some
of
these
tales
came
to
us
no
doubt
from
the
danes
they
were
brought
from
over
the
sea
by
the
fierce
northmen
who
were
after
all
akin
to
the
normans
the
normans
made
them
into
french
stories
and
the
english
turned
them
back
into
english
perhaps
one
of
the
most
interesting
of
these
metrical
romances
is
that
of
havelok
the
dane
the
poem
begins
with
a
few
lines
which
seem
meant
to
call
the
people
together
to
listen
hearken
to
me
good
men
wives
maidens
and
all
men
to
a
tale
that
i
will
tell
to
who
so
will
hear
and
list
thereto
we
can
imagine
the
minstrel
as
he
stands
in
some
or
in
some
firelit
hall
touching
his
harp
lightly
as
he
sings
the
words
with
a
quick
movement
he
throws
back
his
long
green
cloak
and
shows
his
gay
dress
beneath
upon
his
head
he
wears
a
jaunty
cap
and
his
hair
is
long
and
curled
he
sings
the
opening
lines
perhaps
more
than
once
in
order
to
gather
the
people
round
him
then
when
the
eager
crowd
sit
or
stand
about
him
he
begins
his
lay
it
is
most
probably
in
a
that
the
minstrel
stands
and
sings
for
havelok
the
dane
was
written
for
the
people
and
not
for
the
great
folk
who
still
spoke
only
french
there
was
a
king
in
byegone
days
that
in
his
time
wrought
good
laws
he
did
them
make
and
full
well
hold
him
loved
young
him
loved
old
earl
and
baron
strong
man
and
thane
knight
bondman
and
swain
widows
maidens
priests
and
clerks
and
all
for
his
good
works
if
you
will
compare
this
poetry
with
that
of
layamon
you
will
see
that
there
is
something
in
it
quite
different
from
his
this
no
longer
rests
as
that
does
upon
accent
and
alliteration
but
upon
rhyme
the
english
too
in
which
it
is
written
is
much
more
like
the
english
of
for
havelok
was
written
perhaps
a
hundred
years
after
layamon
brut
these
are
the
first
lines
as
they
are
in
the
herknet
to
me
gode
men
wiues
maydnes
and
alle
men
of
a
tale
pat
ich
you
wile
telle
wo
so
it
wile
here
and
yerto
dwelle
that
you
see
except
for
curious
spelling
is
not
very
unlike
our
english
of
although
it
is
fair
to
tell
you
that
all
the
lines
are
not
so
easy
to
understand
as
these
are
chapter
xvii
the
story
of
havelok
the
dane
the
good
king
of
whom
we
read
in
the
last
chapter
was
called
athelwold
and
the
poet
tells
us
that
there
were
happy
days
in
england
while
he
reigned
but
at
length
he
became
sick
unto
death
then
was
he
sore
grieved
because
he
had
no
child
to
sit
upon
the
throne
after
him
save
a
maiden
very
fair
but
so
young
was
she
that
she
could
neither
go
on
foot
nor
speak
with
mouth
so
in
this
grief
and
trouble
the
king
wrote
to
all
his
nobles
from
roxburgh
all
unto
dover
bidding
them
come
to
him
and
all
who
had
the
writings
came
to
the
king
where
he
lay
at
winchester
then
when
they
were
all
come
athelwold
prayed
them
to
be
faithful
to
the
young
princess
and
to
choose
one
of
themselves
to
guard
her
until
she
was
of
age
to
rule
so
godrich
earl
of
cornwall
was
chosen
to
guard
the
princess
for
he
was
a
true
man
wise
in
council
wise
in
deed
and
he
swore
to
protect
his
lady
until
she
was
of
such
age
as
no
longer
to
have
need
of
him
then
he
would
wed
her
he
swore
to
the
best
man
in
all
the
land
so
happy
in
thought
that
his
daughter
should
reign
after
him
in
peace
the
king
died
and
there
was
great
sorrow
and
mourning
throughout
the
land
but
the
people
remained
at
peace
for
the
earl
ruled
well
and
wisely
from
dover
to
roxburgh
all
england
of
him
stood
in
awe
all
england
was
of
him
adread
meanwhile
the
princess
goldboru
grew
daily
more
and
more
fair
and
when
earl
godrich
saw
how
fair
and
noble
she
became
he
sighed
and
asked
himself
whether
she
should
be
queen
and
lady
over
me
whether
she
should
all
england
and
me
and
mine
have
in
her
hand
nay
he
said
have
a
son
a
full
fair
knave
he
shall
england
all
have
he
shall
be
king
he
shall
be
sire
then
full
of
his
evil
purpose
godrich
thought
no
more
of
his
oath
to
the
dead
king
but
cast
goldboru
into
a
darksome
prison
where
she
was
poorly
clad
and
now
it
befell
that
at
this
time
there
was
a
right
good
king
in
denmark
he
had
a
son
named
havelok
and
two
fair
daughters
and
feeling
death
come
upon
him
he
left
his
children
in
the
care
of
his
dear
friend
godard
and
so
died
but
no
sooner
was
the
king
in
his
grave
than
the
false
godard
took
havelok
and
his
two
sisters
and
thrust
them
into
a
dungeon
and
in
the
castle
did
he
them
do
where
no
man
might
come
them
to
of
their
kin
there
they
prison
were
there
they
wept
oft
sort
both
for
hunger
and
for
cold
ere
they
were
three
winters
old
scantily
he
gave
them
clothes
and
cared
not
a
nut
for
his
oaths
he
them
nor
clothed
right
nor
fed
nor
them
richly
gave
to
bed
thane
godard
was
most
sickerly
under
god
the
most
traitorly
that
ever
in
earth
shapen
was
except
the
wicked
judas
after
a
time
the
traitor
went
to
the
tower
where
the
children
were
and
there
he
slew
the
two
little
girls
but
the
boy
havelok
he
spared
for
the
lad
that
little
was
he
kneeled
before
that
judas
and
said
mercy
now
homage
lord
to
you
i
vow
all
denmark
i
to
you
will
give
if
that
now
you
let
me
live
so
the
wicked
earl
spared
the
lad
for
the
time
but
he
did
not
mean
that
he
should
live
anon
he
called
a
fisherman
to
him
and
said
grim
thou
wist
thou
art
my
thral
wilt
thou
do
my
will
all
that
i
will
bid
thee
i
shall
make
thee
free
and
give
thee
goods
and
rich
thee
make
if
that
thou
wilt
this
child
take
and
lead
him
with
thee
when
thou
seest
it
is
moonlight
unto
the
sea
and
do
him
in
and
i
will
take
on
me
the
sin
grim
the
fisherman
rejoiced
at
the
thought
of
being
free
and
rich
so
he
took
the
boy
and
wound
him
in
an
old
cloth
and
stuffed
an
old
coat
into
his
mouth
so
that
he
might
not
cry
aloud
then
he
thrust
him
into
a
sack
and
thus
carried
him
home
to
his
cottage
but
when
the
moon
rose
and
grim
made
ready
to
drown
the
child
his
wife
saw
a
great
light
come
from
the
sack
and
opening
it
they
found
therein
the
prince
then
they
resolved
instead
of
drowning
him
to
save
and
nourish
him
as
their
own
child
but
they
resolved
also
to
hide
the
truth
from
the
earl
at
break
of
day
therefore
grim
set
forth
to
tell
godard
that
his
will
was
done
but
instead
of
the
thanks
and
reward
promised
to
him
he
got
only
evil
words
so
speeding
homeward
from
that
traitor
he
made
ready
his
boat
and
with
his
wife
and
three
sons
and
two
daughters
and
havelok
they
set
sail
upon
the
high
sea
fleeing
for
their
lives
presently
a
great
wind
arose
which
blew
them
to
the
coast
of
england
and
when
they
were
safely
come
to
land
grim
drew
up
his
boat
upon
the
shore
and
there
he
build
him
a
hut
and
there
he
lived
and
to
this
day
men
call
the
place
grimsby
years
passed
havelok
lived
with
the
fisherman
and
grew
great
and
fair
and
strong
and
as
grim
was
poor
the
prince
thought
it
no
dishonor
to
work
for
his
living
and
he
became
in
time
a
cook
scullion
havelok
had
to
work
hard
but
although
he
worked
hard
he
was
always
cheerful
and
merry
he
was
so
strong
that
at
running
jumping
or
throwing
a
stone
no
one
could
beat
him
yet
he
was
so
gentle
that
all
the
children
of
the
place
loved
him
and
played
with
him
him
loved
all
quiet
or
bold
knight
children
young
and
old
all
him
loved
that
him
saw
both
high
men
and
low
of
him
full
wide
the
word
sprang
how
he
was
meek
how
he
was
strong
at
last
even
the
wicked
godrich
in
his
palace
heard
of
havelok
in
the
kitchen
now
truly
this
is
the
best
man
in
england
he
said
with
a
sneer
and
thinking
to
bring
shame
on
goldboru
and
wed
her
with
a
kitchen
knave
he
sent
for
havelok
master
wilt
wed
he
asked
when
the
scullion
was
brought
before
him
nay
quoth
havelok
by
my
life
what
should
i
do
with
a
wife
i
could
not
feed
her
nor
clothe
her
nor
shoe
her
whither
should
i
bring
a
woman
i
have
no
cot
i
have
no
stick
nor
twig
i
have
neither
bread
nor
sauce
and
no
clothes
but
one
old
coat
these
clothes
even
that
i
wear
are
the
cook
and
i
am
his
knave
at
that
godrich
shook
with
wrath
up
he
sprang
and
began
to
beat
havelok
without
mercy
and
said
thou
her
take
that
i
well
ween
thee
to
make
i
shall
hangen
thee
full
high
or
i
shall
thrusten
out
thine
eye
then
seeing
that
there
was
no
help
for
it
and
that
he
must
either
be
wedded
or
hanged
havelok
consented
to
marry
goldboru
so
the
princess
was
brought
the
fairest
woman
under
the
moon
and
she
sore
afraid
at
the
anger
and
threats
of
godrich
durst
not
do
aught
to
oppose
the
wedding
so
were
they
espoused
fair
and
well
by
the
archbishop
of
york
and
havelok
took
his
bride
home
to
grimsby
you
may
be
sure
that
havelok
who
was
so
strong
and
yet
so
gentle
was
kind
to
his
beautiful
young
wife
but
goldboru
was
unhappy
for
she
could
not
forget
the
disgrace
that
had
come
upon
her
she
could
not
forget
that
she
was
a
princess
and
that
she
had
been
forced
to
wed
a
kitchen
knave
but
one
night
as
she
lay
in
bed
weeping
an
angel
appeared
to
her
and
bade
her
sorrow
no
more
for
it
was
no
scullion
that
she
had
wed
but
a
king
son
so
goldboru
was
comforted
and
of
all
that
afterward
befell
havelok
and
goldboru
of
how
they
went
to
denmark
and
overcame
the
traitor
there
and
received
the
kingdom
and
of
how
they
returned
again
to
england
and
of
how
godrich
was
punished
you
must
read
for
yourselves
in
the
book
of
havelok
the
dane
but
this
one
thing
more
i
will
tell
you
that
havelok
and
goldboru
lived
happily
together
until
they
died
they
loved
each
other
so
tenderly
that
they
were
never
angry
with
each
other
they
had
fifteen
children
and
all
the
sons
became
kings
and
all
the
daughters
became
queens
i
should
like
to
tell
you
many
more
of
these
early
english
metrical
romances
i
should
like
to
tell
you
of
guy
of
warwick
of
king
horn
of
william
and
the
werewolf
and
of
many
others
but
indeed
if
i
told
all
the
stories
i
should
like
to
tell
this
book
would
have
no
end
so
we
must
leave
them
and
pass
on
books
to
read
the
story
of
havelok
the
dane
rendered
into
later
english
by
emily
hickey
the
lay
of
havelok
the
dane
edited
by
skeat
in
the
original
english
chapter
xviii
about
some
song
stories
besides
the
metrical
romances
we
may
date
another
kind
of
story
from
this
time
i
mean
the
ballads
ballad
was
an
old
french
word
spelt
balade
it
really
means
a
for
ballads
were
at
first
written
to
be
sung
to
dances
slow
shuffling
balancing
dances
such
as
one
may
still
see
in
places
in
brittany
these
ballads
often
had
a
chorus
or
refrain
in
which
every
one
joined
but
by
degrees
the
refrain
was
dropped
and
the
dancing
too
now
we
think
of
a
ballad
as
a
simple
story
told
in
verse
sometimes
it
is
merry
but
more
often
it
is
sad
the
ballads
were
not
made
for
grand
folk
they
were
not
made
to
be
sung
in
courts
and
halls
they
were
made
for
the
common
people
and
sometimes
at
least
they
were
made
by
them
they
were
meant
to
be
sung
and
sung
out
of
doors
for
in
those
days
the
houses
of
all
but
the
great
were
very
comfortless
they
were
small
and
dark
and
full
of
smoke
it
was
little
wonder
then
that
people
lived
out
of
doors
as
much
as
they
could
and
that
all
their
amusements
were
out
of
doors
and
so
it
comes
about
that
many
of
the
ballads
have
an
feeling
about
them
a
ballad
is
much
shorter
than
a
romance
and
therefore
much
more
easily
learned
and
remembered
so
many
people
learned
and
repeated
the
ballads
and
for
three
hundred
years
they
were
the
chief
literature
of
the
people
in
those
days
men
sang
far
more
and
read
and
thought
far
less
than
nowadays
now
if
we
read
poetry
some
of
us
like
to
be
quietly
by
ourselves
then
all
poetry
was
made
to
be
read
or
sung
aloud
and
that
in
company
i
do
not
mean
you
to
think
that
we
have
any
ballads
remaining
to
us
as
old
as
the
thirteenth
or
the
beginning
of
the
fourteenth
century
which
was
the
time
in
which
havelok
was
written
but
what
i
want
you
to
understand
is
that
the
days
went
on
for
hundreds
of
years
the
people
for
whom
the
ballads
were
made
could
not
read
and
could
not
write
so
it
was
of
little
use
to
write
them
down
and
for
a
long
time
they
were
not
written
down
they
were
made
for
singing
an
no
for
reading
said
an
old
lady
to
sir
walter
scott
who
in
his
day
made
a
collection
of
ballads
they
were
made
for
singing
an
no
for
reading
but
ye
hae
broken
the
charm
now
an
they
never
be
sung
mair
and
so
true
is
this
that
ballads
which
have
never
been
written
down
but
which
are
heard
only
in
places
sung
or
said
by
people
who
have
never
learned
to
read
have
really
more
of
the
feeling
about
them
than
many
of
those
which
we
find
in
books
we
can
not
say
who
made
the
ballads
nowadays
a
poet
makes
a
poem
and
it
is
printed
with
his
name
upon
the
the
poem
belongs
to
him
and
is
known
by
his
name
we
say
for
instance
gray
elegy
or
shakespeare
sonnets
but
many
people
helped
to
make
the
ballads
i
do
not
mean
that
twenty
or
thirty
people
sat
down
together
and
said
let
us
make
a
ballad
that
would
not
have
been
possible
but
perhaps
one
man
heard
a
story
and
put
it
into
verse
another
then
heard
it
and
added
something
to
it
still
another
and
another
heard
repeated
added
to
or
altered
it
in
one
way
or
another
sometimes
the
story
was
made
better
by
the
process
sometimes
it
was
spoiled
but
who
those
men
were
who
made
and
altered
the
ballads
we
do
not
know
they
were
simply
the
people
one
whole
group
of
ballads
tells
of
the
wonderful
deeds
of
robin
hood
who
robin
hood
was
we
do
not
certainly
know
nor
does
it
matter
much
legend
has
made
him
a
man
of
gentle
birth
who
had
lost
his
lands
and
money
and
who
had
fled
to
the
woods
as
an
outlaw
stories
gradually
gathered
round
his
name
as
they
had
gathered
round
the
name
of
arthur
and
he
came
to
be
looked
upon
as
the
champion
of
the
people
against
the
norman
tyrants
robin
was
a
robber
but
a
robber
as
courtly
as
any
knight
his
enemies
were
the
rich
and
great
his
friends
were
the
poor
and
oppressed
for
i
never
yet
hurt
any
man
that
honest
is
and
true
but
those
that
give
their
minds
to
live
upon
other
men
due
i
never
hurt
the
husbandmen
that
used
to
till
the
ground
nor
spill
their
blood
that
range
the
wood
to
follow
hawk
or
hound
my
chiefest
spite
to
clergy
is
who
in
those
days
bear
a
great
sway
with
friars
and
monks
with
their
fine
sprunks
i
make
my
chiefest
prey
the
last
time
we
heard
of
monks
and
priests
they
were
the
friends
of
the
people
doing
their
best
to
teach
them
and
make
them
happy
now
we
find
that
they
are
looked
upon
as
enemies
and
the
monasteries
which
at
the
beginning
had
been
like
lamps
of
light
set
in
a
dark
country
had
themselves
become
centers
of
darkness
and
idleness
but
although
robin
fought
against
the
clergy
the
friars
and
monks
who
did
wrong
he
did
not
fight
against
religion
a
good
manner
then
had
robin
in
land
where
that
he
were
every
day
ere
he
would
dine
three
masses
would
he
hear
the
one
in
worship
of
the
father
and
another
of
the
holy
ghost
the
third
of
our
dear
lady
that
he
loved
all
the
most
robin
loved
our
dear
lady
for
doubt
of
deadly
sin
would
he
never
do
company
harm
that
any
woman
was
in
and
robin
himself
tells
his
followers
but
look
ye
do
not
husbandman
harm
that
tilleth
with
his
plough
no
more
ye
shall
no
good
yeoman
that
walketh
by
green
wood
shaw
nor
no
knight
nor
no
squire
that
will
be
good
fellow
these
bishops
and
these
archbishops
ye
shall
them
beat
and
bind
the
high
sheriff
of
nottingham
him
hold
ye
in
your
mind
the
great
idea
of
the
robin
hood
ballads
is
the
victory
of
the
poor
and
oppressed
over
the
rich
and
powerful
the
triumph
of
the
lawless
over
the
because
of
this
and
because
we
like
robin
much
better
than
the
sheriff
of
nottingham
his
chief
enemy
we
are
not
to
think
that
the
poor
were
always
right
and
the
rulers
always
wrong
there
were
many
good
men
among
the
despised
monks
and
friars
bishops
and
archbishops
but
there
were
too
many
evils
in
the
land
and
some
of
the
laws
pressed
sorely
on
the
people
yet
they
were
never
without
a
voice
the
robin
hood
ballads
are
full
of
humor
they
are
full
too
of
english
outdoor
life
of
hunting
and
fighting
of
quite
another
style
is
the
ballad
of
sir
patrick
spens
that
takes
us
away
from
the
green
leafy
woods
and
dells
of
england
to
the
wild
rocky
coast
of
scotland
it
takes
us
from
the
singing
of
birds
to
the
roar
of
the
waves
the
story
goes
that
the
king
wanted
a
good
sailor
to
sail
across
the
sea
then
an
old
knight
says
to
him
that
the
best
sailor
that
ever
sailed
the
sea
is
sir
patrick
spens
so
the
king
writes
a
letter
bidding
sir
patrick
make
ready
at
first
he
is
pleased
to
get
a
letter
from
the
king
but
when
he
has
read
what
is
in
it
his
face
grows
sad
and
angry
too
who
has
done
me
this
evil
deed
he
cries
to
send
me
out
to
sea
in
such
weather
sir
patrick
is
very
unwilling
to
go
but
the
king
has
commanded
so
he
and
his
men
set
forth
a
great
storm
comes
upon
them
and
the
ship
is
wrecked
all
the
men
are
drowned
and
the
ladies
who
sit
at
home
waiting
their
husbands
return
wait
in
vain
there
are
many
versions
of
this
ballad
but
i
give
you
here
one
of
the
shortest
and
perhaps
the
most
beautiful
the
king

in
dumferling

let

one
more
poem
it
is
the
earliest
english
song
that
is
known
it
is
a
spring
song
and
it
is
so
full
of
the
sunny
green
of
fresh
young
leaves
and
of
all
the
sights
and
sounds
of
early
summer
that
i

piers
the
ploughman
during
the
long
years
after
the
norman
conquest
when
english
was
a
despised
language
it
became
broken
up
into
many
dialects
but
as
time
went
on
and
english
became
once
more
the
language
of
the
educated
as
well
as
of
the
uneducated
there
arose
a
cultured
english
which
became
the
language
which
we
speak
in
the
time
of
edward
iii
england
was
england
again
and
the
rulers
were
english
both
in
heart
and
in
name
but
england
was
no
longer
a
country
apart
she
was
no
longer
a
lonely
island
but
had
taken
her
place
among
the
great
countries
of
europe
for
the
reign
of
edward
iii
was
a
brilliant
one
the
knightly
chivalrous
king
set
his
country
high
among
the
countries
of
europe
men
made
songs
and
sang
of
his
victories
of
creçy
and
of
calais
and
france
bowed
the
knee
to
england
but
the
wars
and
triumphs
of
the
king
pressed
hardly
on
the
people
of
england
and
ere
his
reign
was
over
misery
pestilence
and
famine
filled
the
land
so
many
men
had
been
killed
in
edward
french
and
scottish
wars
that
there
were
too
few
left
to
till
the
land
then
came
a
terrible
disease
called
the
black
death
slaying
young
and
old
rich
and
poor
until
nearly
half
the
people
in
the
land
were
dead
then
fewer
still
were
left
to
do
the
work
of
the
farms
cattle
and
sheep
strayed
where
they
would
for
there
were
none
to
tend
them
corn
ripened
and
rotted
in
the
fields
for
there
were
none
to
gather
it
food
grew
dear
as
workers
grew
scarce
then
the
field
laborers
who
were
left
began
to
demand
larger
wages
many
of
these
laborers
were
little
more
than
slaves
and
their
masters
refused
to
pay
them
better
then
some
left
their
homes
and
went
away
to
seek
new
masters
who
would
be
willing
to
pay
more
while
others
took
to
a
life
of
wandering
beggary
the
owners
of
the
land
had
thought
that
they
should
be
ruined
did
they
pay
the
great
wages
demanded
of
them
now
they
saw
that
they
should
be
ruined
quite
as
much
if
they
could
find
no
one
at
all
to
do
the
work
so
laws
were
made
forcing
men
to
work
for
the
same
wages
they
had
received
before
the
plague
and
forbidding
them
to
leave
the
towns
and
villages
in
which
they
had
been
used
to
live
if
they
disobeyed
they
were
imprisoned
and
punished
yet
these
new
laws
were
broken
again
and
again
because
bread
had
now
become
so
dear
that
it
was
impossible
for
men
to
live
on
as
little
as
they
had
done
before
still
many
masters
tried
to
enforce
the
law
and
the
land
was
soon
filled
not
only
with
hunger
and
misery
but
with
a
fierce
class
hatred
between
master
and
man
it
was
the
beginning
of
a
long
and
bitter
struggle
and
as
the
cry
of
the
poor
grew
louder
and
louder
the
hatred
and
spirit
of
revolt
grew
fiercer
but
the
great
of
the
land
seemed
little
touched
by
the
sorrows
of
the
people
while
they
starved
and
died
the
king
surrounded
by
a
glittering
court
gave
splendid
feasts
and
tournaments
he
built
fair
palaces
and
chapels
founded
a
new
round
table
and
thought
to
make
the
glorious
days
of
arthur
live
again
and
the
great
among
the
clergy
cared
as
little
for
the
poor
as
did
the
great
among
the
nobles
many
of
them
had
become
selfish
and
worldly
some
of
them
wicked
though
of
course
there
were
many
good
men
left
among
them
too
the
church
was
wealthy
but
the
powerful
priests
kept
that
wealth
in
their
own
hands
and
many
of
the
country
clergy
were
almost
as
miserably
poor
as
the
people
whom
they
taught
and
it
was
through
one
of
these
poor
priests
named
william
langland
that
the
sorrows
of
the
people
found
a
voice
we
know
very
little
about
langland
so
little
do
we
know
that
we
are
not
sure
if
his
name
was
really
william
or
not
but
in
his
poem
called
the
vision
of
piers
the
ploughman
he
says
i
have
lived
in
the
land
quoth
i
my
name
is
long
will
it
is
chiefly
from
his
poem
that
we
learn
to
know
the
man
when
we
have
read
it
we
seem
to
see
him
tall
and
thin
with
lean
earnest
face
out
of
which
shine
great
eyes
the
eyes
that
see
visions
his
head
is
shaven
like
a
monk
he
wears
a
shabby
long
gown
which
flaps
in
the
breeze
as
he
strides
along
langland
was
born
in
the
country
perhaps
in
oxfordshire
perhaps
in
shropshire
and
he
went
to
school
at
great
malvern
he
loved
school
for
he
says
for
if
heaven
be
on
earth
and
ease
to
any
soul
it
is
in
cloister
or
in
school
be
many
reasons
i
find
for
in
the
cloister
cometh
no
man
to
chide
nor
to
fight
but
all
is
obedience
here
and
books
to
read
and
to
learn
perhaps
langland
friends
saw
that
he
was
clever
and
hoped
that
he
might
become
one
of
the
great
ones
in
the
church
in
those
days
the
middle
ages
they
were
called
there
was
no
sharp
line
dividing
the
priests
from
the
people
the
one
shaded
off
into
the
other
as
it
were
there
were
many
who
wore
long
gowns
and
shaved
their
heads
who
yet
were
not
priests
they
were
called
clerks
and
for
a
sum
of
money
often
very
small
they
helped
to
sing
masses
for
the
souls
of
the
dead
and
performed
other
offices
in
connection
with
the
services
of
the
church
they
were
bound
by
no
vows
and
were
allowed
to
marry
but
of
course
could
never
hope
to
be
powerful
such
was
langland
he
married
and
always
remained
a
poor
clerk
but
if
langland
did
not
rise
high
in
the
church
he
made
himself
famous
in
another
way
for
he
wrote
piers
the
ploughman
this
is
a
great
book
there
is
no
other
written
during
the
fourteenth
century
in
which
we
see
so
clearly
the
life
of
the
people
of
the
time
there
are
several
versions
of
piers
and
it
is
thought
by
some
that
langland
himself
wrote
and
his
poem
trying
always
to
make
it
better
but
others
think
that
some
one
else
wrote
the
later
versions
the
poem
is
divided
into
parts
the
first
part
is
the
vision
of
piers
the
ploughman
the
second
is
the
vision
concerning
do
well
do
bet
do
best
in
the
beginning
of
piers
the
ploughman
langland
tells
us
how
in
a
summer
season
when
soft
was
the
sun
i
wrapped
myself
in
a
cloak
as
if
i
were
a
shepherd
in
the
habit
of
a
hermit
unholy
of
works
abroad
i
wandered
in
this
world
wonders
to
hear
but
on
a
may
morning
on
malvern
hills
me
befell
a
wonder
a
strange
thing
methought
i
was
weary
of
wandering
and
went
me
to
rest
under
a
broad
bank
by
a
burn
side
and
as
i
lay
and
leaned
and
looked
on
the
waters
i
slumbered
in
a
sleeping
it
sounded
so
merry
if
you
will
look
back
you
will
see
that
this
poetry
is
very
much
more
like
layamon
than
like
the
poetry
of
havelok
the
dane
although
people
had
for
many
years
been
writing
rhyming
verse
langland
has
you
see
gone
back
to
the
old
alliterative
poetry
perhaps
it
was
that
living
far
away
in
the
country
langland
had
written
his
poem
before
he
had
heard
of
the
new
kind
of
rhyming
verses
for
news
traveled
slowly
in
those
days
two
hundred
years
later
when
the
vision
of
piers
the
ploughman
was
first
printed
the
printer
in
his
preface
explained
alliterative
verse
very
well
langland
wrote
altogether
in
metre
he
says
but
not
after
the
manner
of
our
rimers
that
write
nowadays
for
his
verses
end
not
alike
but
the
nature
of
his
metre
is
to
have
three
words
at
the
least
in
every
verse
which
begin
with
some
one
letter
as
for
example
the
first
two
verses
of
the
book
run
upon
as
thus
a
somer
season
whan
sette
was
the
sunne
i
shope
me
into
shrobbes
as
i
a
shepe
were
the
next
runneth
upon
as
thus
habite
as
an
hermite
unholy
of
workes
this
thing
being
noted
the
metre
shall
be
very
pleasant
to
read
the
english
is
according
to
the
time
it
was
written
in
and
the
sense
somewhat
dark
but
not
so
hard
but
that
it
may
be
understood
of
such
as
will
not
stick
to
break
the
shell
of
the
nut
for
the
kernel
sake
this
printer
also
says
in
his
preface
that
the
book
was
first
written
in
the
time
of
king
edward
iii
in
whose
time
it
pleased
god
to
open
the
eyes
of
many
to
see
his
truth
giving
them
boldness
of
heart
to
open
their
mouths
and
cry
out
against
the
works
of
darkness
there
is
no
manner
of
vice
that
reigneth
in
any
estate
of
man
which
this
writer
hath
not
godly
learnedly
and
wittily
rebuked
crowley
is
his
preface
to
piers
ploughman
printed
in
i
hope
that
you
will
be
among
those
who
will
not
stick
to
break
the
shell
of
the
nut
for
the
kernel
sake
and
that
although
the
sense
be
somewhat
dark
you
will
some
day
read
the
book
for
yourselves
meantime
in
the
next
chapter
i
will
tell
you
a
little
more
about
it
chapter
xx
piers
the
ploughman
continued
when
langland
fell
asleep
upon
the
malvern
hills
he
dreamed
a
wondrous
dream
he
thought
that
he
saw
a
fair
field
full
of
folk
where
was
gathered
all
the
wealth
of
the
world
and
the
woe
both
working
and
wondering
as
the
world
asketh
some
put
them
to
the
plough
and
played
them
full
seldom
in
eareing
and
sowing
laboured
full
hard
but
some
are
gluttons
and
others
think
only
of
fine
clothes
some
pray
and
others
jest
there
are
rogues
and
knaves
here
friars
and
priests
barons
and
burgesses
bakers
and
butchers
tailors
and
tanners
masons
and
miners
and
folk
of
many
other
crafts
indeed
the
field
is
the
world
it
lies
between
a
tower
and
a
dungeon
the
tower
is
god
the
dungeon
is
the
dwelling
of
the
evil
one
then
as
langland
looked
on
all
this
he
saw
a
lady
lovely
in
face
in
linnen
come
adown
from
the
cliff
and
spake
me
fair
and
said
sleepest
thou
seest
thou
this
people
all
how
busy
they
be
about
the
maze
langland
was
afeard
of
her
face
though
she
was
fair
but
the
lovely
lady
who
is
holy
church
speaks
gently
to
the
dreamer
she
tells
him
that
the
tower
is
the
dwelling
of
truth
who
is
the
lord
of
all
and
who
gives
to
each
as
he
hath
need
the
dungeon
is
the
castle
of
care
therein
liveth
a
wight
that
wrong
is
called
the
father
of
falseness
love
alone
said
the
lady
leads
to
heaven
therefore
i
warn
ye
the
rich
have
ruth
on
the
poor
though
ye
be
mighty
in
councils
be
meek
in
your
works
for
the
same
measure
ye
meet
amiss
or
otherwise
ye
shall
be
weighed
therewith
when
ye
wend
hence
truth
is
best
in
all
things
she
said
at
length
i
have
told
thee
now
what
truth
is
and
may
no
longer
linger
and
so
she
made
ready
to
go
but
the
dreamer
kneeled
on
his
knees
and
prayed
her
stay
yet
a
while
to
teach
him
to
know
falsehood
also
as
well
as
truth
and
the
lady
answered
on
thy
left
hand
and
see
where
he
standeth
both
false
and
flattery
and
all
his
train
i
looked
on
the
left
hand
as
the
lady
me
taught
then
was
i
ware
of
a
woman
wondrously
clothéd
purfled
with
fur
the
richest
on
earth
crowned
with
a
crown
the
king
hath
no
better
all
her
five
fingers
were
fretted
with
rings
of
the
most
precious
stones
that
a
prince
ever
wore
in
red
scarlet
she
rode
beribboned
with
gold
there
is
no
queen
alive
that
is
more
adorned
this
was
lady
meed
or
bribery
said
holy
church
she
shall
wed
with
false
and
so
the
lovely
lady
departed
left
alone
the
dreamer
watched
the
preparations
for
the
wedding
the
earldom
of
envy
the
kingdom
of
covetousness
the
isle
of
usury
were
granted
as
marriage
gifts
to
the
pair
but
theology
was
angry
he
would
not
permit
the
wedding
to
take
place
ere
this
wedding
be
wrought
woe
betide
thee
he
cried
meed
is
wealthy
i
know
it
god
grant
us
to
give
her
unto
whom
truth
wills
but
thou
hast
bound
her
fast
to
falseness
meed
is
gently
born
lead
her
therefore
to
london
and
there
see
if
the
law
allows
this
wedding
so
listening
to
the
advice
of
theology
all
the
company
rode
off
to
london
guile
leading
the
way
but
soothness
pricked
on
his
palfrey
and
passed
them
all
and
came
to
the
king
court
where
he
told
conscience
all
about
the
matter
and
conscience
told
the
king
then
quoth
the
king
if
i
might
catch
false
and
flattery
or
any
of
their
masters
i
would
avenge
me
on
the
wretches
that
work
so
ill
and
would
hang
them
by
the
neck
and
all
that
them
abet
so
he
told
the
constable
to
seize
false
and
to
cut
off
head
and
let
not
liar
escape
but
dread
was
at
the
door
and
heard
the
doom
he
warned
the
others
so
that
they
all
fled
away
save
meed
the
maiden
save
meed
the
maiden
no
man
durst
abide
and
truly
to
tell
she
trembled
for
fear
and
she
wept
and
wrung
her
hands
when
she
was
taken
but
the
king
called
a
clerk
and
told
him
to
comfort
meed
so
justice
soon
hurried
to
her
bower
to
comfort
her
kindly
and
many
others
followed
him
meed
thanked
them
all
and
gave
them
cups
of
clean
gold
and
pieces
of
silver
rings
with
rubies
and
riches
enough
and
pretending
to
be
sorry
for
all
that
she
had
done
amiss
meed
confessed
her
sins
and
was
forgiven
the
king
then
believing
that
she
was
really
sorry
wished
to
marry
her
to
conscience
but
conscience
would
not
have
her
for
he
knew
that
she
was
wicked
he
tells
of
all
the
evil
things
she
does
by
which
langland
means
to
show
what
wicked
things
men
will
do
if
tempted
by
bribery
and
the
hope
of
gain
then
mourned
meed
and
plained
her
to
the
king
if
men
did
great
and
noble
deeds
she
said
they
deserved
praise
and
thanks
and
rewards
quoth
conscience
to
the
king
and
kneeled
to
the
ground
be
two
manner
of
meeds
my
lord
by
thy
life
that
one
the
good
god
giveth
by
his
grace
giveth
in
his
bliss
to
them
that
will
work
while
that
they
are
here
what
a
laborer
received
he
said
was
not
meed
but
just
wages
bribery
on
the
other
hand
was
ever
wicked
and
he
would
have
none
of
her
in
spite
of
all
the
talk
however
no
one
could
settle
the
question
so
at
length
conscience
set
forth
to
bring
reason
to
decide
when
reason
heard
that
he
was
wanted
he
saddled
his
horse
and
came
to
court
with
wit
and
wisdom
in
his
train
the
king
received
him
kindly
and
they
talked
together
but
while
they
talked
peace
came
complaining
that
wrong
had
stolen
his
goods
and
him
in
many
ways
wrong
well
knew
that
the
complaint
was
just
but
with
the
help
of
meed
he
won
wit
and
wisdom
to
his
side
but
reason
stood
out
against
him
me
not
quoth
reason
to
have
till
lords
and
ladies
all
love
truth
and
their
sumptuous
garments
be
put
into
chests
till
spoiled
children
be
chastened
with
rods
till
clerks
and
knights
be
courteous
with
their
tongues
till
priests
themselves
practise
their
preaching
and
their
deeds
be
such
as
may
draw
us
to
goodness
the
king
acknowledged
that
reason
was
right
and
begged
him
to
stay
with
him
always
and
help
him
to
rule
i
am
ready
quoth
reason
to
rest
with
thee
ever
so
that
conscience
be
our
counsellor
to
that
the
king
agreed
and
he
and
his
courtiers
all
went
to
church
here
suddenly
the
dream
ends
langland
cries
then
waked
i
of
my
sleep
i
was
woe
withal
that
i
had
not
slept
more
soundly
and
seen
much
more
the
dreamer
arose
and
continued
his
wandering
but
he
had
only
gone
a
few
steps
when
once
again
he
sank
upon
the
grass
and
fell
asleep
and
dreamed
again
he
saw
the
field
full
of
folk
and
to
them
now
conscience
was
preaching
and
at
his
words
many
began
to
repent
them
of
their
evil
deeds
pride
envy
sloth
and
others
confessed
their
sins
and
received
forgiveness
then
all
these
penitent
folk
set
forth
in
search
of
saint
truth
some
riding
some
walking
but
there
were
few
there
so
wise
as
to
know
the
way
thither
and
they
went
all
amiss
no
man
could
tell
them
where
saint
truth
lived
and
now
appears
at
last
piers
ploughman
who
gives
his
name
to
the
whole
poem
quoth
a
ploughman
and
put
forth
his
head
know
him
as
well
as
a
clerk
know
his
books
clear
conscience
and
wit
showed
me
his
place
and
did
engage
me
since
to
serve
him
ever
both
in
sowing
and
setting
which
i
labour
i
have
been
his
man
this
fifteen
winters
piers
described
to
the
pilgrims
all
the
long
way
that
they
must
go
in
order
to
find
truth
he
told
them
that
they
must
go
through
meekness
that
they
must
cross
the
ford
and
turn
aside
from
the
brook
and
so
on
and
on
until
they
come
at
last
to
saint
truth
it
were
a
hard
road
unless
we
had
a
guide
that
might
go
with
us
afoot
until
we
got
there
said
the
pilgrims
so
piers
offered
if
they
would
wait
until
he
had
plowed
his
field
to
go
with
them
and
show
them
the
way
that
would
be
a
long
time
to
wait
said
a
lady
what
could
we
women
do
meantime
and
piers
answered
some
should
sew
sacks
to
hold
wheat
and
you
who
have
wool
weave
it
fast
spin
it
speedily
spare
not
your
fingers
unless
it
be
a
holy
day
or
holy
eve
look
out
your
linen
and
work
on
it
quickly
the
needy
and
the
naked
take
care
how
they
live
and
cast
on
them
clothes
for
the
cold
for
so
truth
desires
then
many
of
the
pilgrims
began
to
help
piers
with
his
work
each
man
did
what
he
could
and
some
to
please
piers
picked
up
the
weeds
but
some
of
them
sat
and
sang
at
ale
and
helped
him
to
plough
with
to
these
idle
ones
piers
went
in
anger
if
ye
do
not
run
quickly
to
your
work
he
cried
you
will
receive
no
wage
and
if
ye
die
of
hunger
who
will
care
then
these
idle
ones
began
to
pretend
that
they
were
blind
or
lame
and
could
not
work
they
made
great
moan
but
piers
took
no
heed
and
called
for
hunger
then
hunger
seized
the
idle
ones
and
beat
and
buffeted
them
until
they
were
glad
to
work
at
last
truth
heard
of
piers
and
of
all
the
good
that
he
was
doing
among
the
pilgrims
and
sent
him
a
pardon
for
all
his
sins
in
those
days
people
who
had
done
wrong
used
to
pay
money
to
a
priest
and
think
that
they
were
forgiven
by
god
against
that
belief
langland
preaches
and
his
pardon
is
something
different
it
is
only
do
well
and
have
well
and
god
shall
have
thy
soul
and
do
evil
and
have
evil
hope
none
other
that
after
thy
death
day
thou
shalt
turn
to
the
evil
one
and
over
this
pardon
a
priest
and
piers
began
so
loudly
to
dispute
that
the
dreamer
awoke
and
saw
the
sun
that
time
towards
the
south
and
i
meatless
and
moneyless
upon
the
malvern
hills
that
is
a
little
of
the
story
of
the
first
part
of
piers
ploughman
it
is
an
allegory
and
in
writing
it
langland
wished
to
hold
up
to
scorn
all
the
wickedness
that
he
saw
around
him
and
sharply
to
point
out
many
causes
of
misery
there
is
laughter
in
his
poem
but
it
is
the
terrible
and
harsh
laughter
of
contempt
his
most
bitter
words
perhaps
are
for
the
idle
rich
but
the
idle
poor
do
not
escape
those
who
beg
without
shame
who
cheat
and
steal
who
are
greedy
and
drunken
have
a
share
of
his
wrath
yet
langland
is
not
all
harshness
his
great
word
is
duty
but
he
speaks
of
love
too
learn
to
love
quoth
king
and
leave
off
all
other
the
poem
is
rambling
and
disconnected
characters
come
on
the
scene
and
vanish
again
without
cause
stories
begin
and
do
not
end
it
is
all
wild
and
improbable
like
a
dream
yet
it
is
full
of
interest
but
perhaps
the
chief
interest
and
value
of
piers
ploughman
is
that
it
is
history
it
tells
us
much
of
what
the
people
thought
and
of
how
they
lived
in
those
days
it
shows
us
the
first
mutterings
of
the
storm
that
was
to
rend
the
world
this
was
the
storm
of
the
reformation
which
was
to
divide
the
world
into
protestant
and
catholic
but
langland
himself
was
not
a
protestant
although
he
speaks
bitter
words
against
the
evil
deeds
of
priest
and
monk
he
does
not
attack
the
church
to
him
she
is
still
holy
church
a
radiant
and
lovely
lady
books
to
read
the
vision
of
piers
ploughman
by
langland
chapter
xxi
how
the
bible
came
to
the
people
in
all
the
land
there
is
perhaps
no
book
so
common
as
the
bible
in
homes
where
there
are
no
other
books
we
find
at
least
a
bible
and
the
bible
stories
are
almost
the
first
that
we
learn
to
know
but
in
the
fourteenth
century
there
were
no
english
bibles
the
priests
and
clergy
and
a
few
great
people
perhaps
had
latin
bibles
and
although
caedmon
songs
had
long
been
forgotten
at
different
times
some
parts
of
the
bible
had
been
translated
into
english
so
that
the
common
people
sometimes
heard
a
bible
story
but
an
english
bible
as
a
whole
did
not
exist
and
if
it
is
the
commonest
and
cheapest
book
in
all
the
land
it
is
to
john
wyclif
in
the
first
place
that
we
owe
it
john
wyclif
was
born
it
is
thought
about
in
a
little
yorkshire
village
not
much
is
known
of
his
early
days
except
that
he
went
to
school
and
to
oxford
university
in
time
he
became
one
of
the
most
learned
men
of
his
day
and
was
made
head
or
master
of
balliol
college
this
is
the
first
time
in
this
book
that
we
have
heard
of
a
university
the
monasteries
had
until
now
been
the
centers
of
learning
but
now
the
two
great
universities
of
oxford
and
cambridge
were
taking
their
place
men
no
longer
went
to
the
monasteries
to
learn
but
to
the
universities
and
this
was
one
reason
perhaps
why
the
land
had
become
filled
with
so
many
idle
monks
their
profession
of
teaching
had
been
taken
from
them
and
they
had
found
nothing
else
with
which
to
fill
their
time
but
at
first
the
universities
were
very
like
monasteries
the
clerks
as
the
students
were
called
often
took
some
kind
of
vow
they
wore
a
gown
and
shaved
their
heads
in
some
fashion
or
other
the
colleges
too
were
built
very
much
after
the
style
of
monasteries
as
may
be
seen
in
some
of
the
old
college
buildings
of
oxford
or
cambridge
to
this
day
the
life
in
every
way
was
like
the
life
in
a
monastery
it
was
only
by
slow
degrees
that
the
life
and
the
teaching
grew
away
from
the
old
model
while
wyclif
grew
to
be
a
man
england
had
fallen
on
troublous
times
edward
iii
worn
out
by
his
french
wars
had
become
old
and
feeble
and
the
power
was
in
the
hands
of
his
son
john
of
gaunt
the
french
wars
and
the
black
death
had
slain
many
of
the
people
and
those
who
remained
were
miserably
poor
yet
poor
though
they
were
much
money
was
gathered
from
them
every
year
and
sent
to
the
pope
who
at
that
time
still
ruled
the
church
in
england
as
elsewhere
but
now
the
people
of
england
became
very
unwilling
to
pay
so
much
money
to
the
pope
especially
as
at
this
time
he
was
a
frenchman
ruling
not
from
rome
but
from
avignon
it
was
folly
englishmen
said
to
pay
money
into
the
hands
of
a
frenchman
the
enemy
of
their
country
who
would
use
it
against
their
country
and
while
many
people
were
feeling
like
this
the
pope
claimed
still
more
he
now
claimed
a
tribute
which
king
john
had
promised
long
before
but
which
had
not
for
more
than
thirty
years
been
paid
john
of
gaunt
made
up
his
mind
to
resist
this
claim
and
john
wyclif
who
had
already
begun
to
preach
against
the
power
of
the
pope
helped
him
they
were
strange
companions
and
while
john
of
gaunt
fought
only
for
more
power
wyclif
fought
for
freedom
both
in
religion
and
in
life
god
alone
was
lord
of
all
the
world
he
said
and
to
god
alone
each
man
must
answer
for
his
soul
and
to
no
man
beside
the
money
belonging
to
the
church
of
england
belonged
to
god
and
to
the
people
of
england
and
ought
to
be
used
for
the
good
of
the
people
and
not
be
sent
abroad
to
the
pope
in
those
days
it
needed
a
bold
man
to
use
such
words
and
wyclif
was
soon
called
upon
to
answer
for
his
boldness
before
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
and
all
his
bishops
the
council
was
held
in
paul
cathedral
in
london
wyclif
was
fearless
and
he
obeyed
the
archbishop
command
but
as
he
walked
up
the
long
aisle
to
the
chapel
where
the
bishops
were
gathered
john
of
gaunt
marched
by
his
side
and
lord
percy
earl
marshal
of
england
cleared
a
way
for
him
through
the
throng
of
people
that
filled
the
church
the
press
was
great
and
earl
percy
drove
a
way
through
the
crowd
with
so
much
haughtiness
and
violence
that
the
bishop
of
london
cried
out
at
him
in
wrath
had
i
known
what
masteries
you
would
use
in
my
church
he
said
i
had
kept
you
from
coming
there
at
which
words
the
duke
disdaining
not
a
little
answered
the
bishop
and
said
that
he
would
keep
such
mastery
there
though
he
said
thus
after
much
struggling
wyclif
and
his
companions
arrived
at
the
chapel
there
wyclif
stood
humbly
enough
before
his
bishop
but
earl
percy
bade
him
be
seated
for
as
he
had
much
to
answer
he
had
need
of
a
soft
seat
acts
and
monuments
thereat
the
bishop
of
london
was
angry
again
and
cried
out
saying
that
it
was
not
the
custom
for
those
who
had
come
to
answer
for
their
misdeeds
to
sit
upon
these
words
a
fire
began
to
heat
and
kindle
between
them
insomuch
that
they
began
to
rate
and
revile
one
the
other
that
the
whole
multitude
therewith
disquieted
began
to
be
set
on
a
hurry
acts
and
monuments
the
duke
too
joined
in
threatening
at
last
to
drag
the
bishop
out
of
the
church
by
the
hair
of
his
head
but
the
londoners
when
they
heard
that
were
very
wrathful
for
they
hated
the
duke
they
cried
out
they
would
not
suffer
their
bishop
to
be
and
the
uproar
became
so
great
that
the
council
broke
up
without
there
being
any
trial
at
all
but
soon
after
this
no
fewer
than
five
bulls
or
letters
from
the
pope
were
sent
against
wyclif
in
one
the
university
of
oxford
was
ordered
to
imprison
him
in
others
wyclif
was
ordered
to
appear
before
the
pope
in
still
another
the
english
bishops
were
ordered
to
arrest
him
and
try
him
themselves
but
little
was
done
for
the
english
would
not
imprison
an
english
subject
at
the
bidding
of
a
french
pope
lest
they
should
seem
to
give
him
royal
power
in
england
at
length
however
wyclif
was
once
more
brought
before
a
court
of
bishops
in
london
by
this
time
edward
iii
had
died
and
richard
the
young
son
of
the
black
prince
had
come
to
the
throne
his
mother
the
princess
of
wales
was
wyclif
friend
and
she
now
sent
a
message
to
the
bishops
bidding
them
let
him
alone
this
time
too
the
people
of
london
were
on
his
side
they
had
learned
to
understand
that
he
was
their
friend
so
they
burst
into
the
eager
to
defend
the
man
whose
only
crime
was
that
of
trying
to
protect
england
from
being
robbed
and
thus
the
second
trial
came
to
an
end
as
the
first
had
done
wyclif
now
began
to
preach
more
boldly
than
before
he
preached
many
things
that
were
very
different
from
the
teaching
of
the
church
of
rome
and
as
he
was
one
of
the
most
learned
men
of
his
time
people
crowded
to
oxford
to
hear
him
john
of
gaunt
now
no
longer
his
friend
ordered
him
to
be
silent
but
wyclif
still
spoke
the
university
was
ordered
to
crush
the
heretic
but
the
university
stood
by
him
until
the
king
added
his
orders
to
those
of
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
then
wyclif
was
expelled
from
the
university
but
still
not
silenced
for
he
went
into
the
country
and
there
wrote
and
taught
soon
his
followers
grew
in
numbers
they
were
called
poor
priests
and
clad
in
long
brown
robes
they
wandered
on
foot
through
the
towns
and
villages
teaching
and
preaching
wyclif
trusted
that
they
would
do
all
the
good
that
the
old
friars
had
done
and
that
they
would
be
kept
from
falling
into
the
evil
ways
of
the
later
friars
but
churchmen
were
angry
and
called
his
followers
lollards
or
idle
babblers
wyclif
however
cared
no
longer
for
the
great
he
trusted
no
more
in
them
it
was
to
the
people
now
that
he
appealed
he
wrote
many
books
and
at
first
he
wrote
in
latin
but
by
degrees
he
saw
that
if
he
wanted
to
reach
the
hearts
of
the
people
he
must
preach
and
teach
in
english
and
so
he
began
to
write
english
books
but
above
all
the
things
that
he
wrote
we
remember
him
chiefly
for
his
translation
of
the
bible
he
himself
translated
the
new
testament
and
others
helped
him
with
the
old
testament
and
so
for
the
first
time
the
people
of
england
had
the
whole
bible
in
their
own
tongue
they
had
it
too
in
fine
scholarly
language
and
this
was
a
great
service
to
our
literature
for
naturally
the
bible
was
a
book
which
every
one
wished
to
know
and
the
people
of
england
through
it
became
accustomed
to
use
fine
stately
language
to
his
life
end
wyclif
went
on
teaching
and
writing
although
many
attempts
were
made
to
silence
him
at
last
in
the
pope
summoned
him
to
rome
wyclif
did
not
obey
for
he
answered
another
call
one
day
as
he
heard
mass
in
his
own
church
he
fell
forward
speechless
he
never
spoke
again
but
died
three
days
later
after
wyclif
death
his
followers
were
gradually
crushed
out
and
the
lollards
disappear
from
our
history
but
his
teaching
never
quite
died
for
by
giving
the
english
people
the
bible
wyclif
left
a
lasting
mark
on
england
and
although
the
reformation
did
not
come
until
two
hundred
years
later
he
may
be
looked
upon
as
its
forerunner
it
is
hard
to
explain
all
that
william
langland
and
john
wyclif
stand
for
in
english
literature
and
in
english
history
it
was
the
evil
that
they
saw
around
them
that
made
them
write
and
speak
as
they
did
and
it
was
their
speaking
and
writing
perhaps
that
gave
the
people
courage
to
rise
against
oppression
thus
their
teaching
and
writing
mark
the
beginning
of
new
life
to
the
great
mass
of
the
people
of
england
for
in
june
while
john
wyclif
still
lived
and
wrote
wat
tyler
led
his
men
to
blackheath
in
a
rebellion
which
proved
to
be
the
beginning
of
freedom
for
the
workers
of
england
and
although
at
first
sight
there
seems
to
be
no
connection
between
the
two
it
was
the
same
spirit
working
in
john
wyclif
and
wat
tyler
that
made
the
one
speak
and
the
other
fight
as
he
did

as
we
walk
about
the

and
watch
the
people
hurry
to
and
fro
we
can
not
tell
from
the
dress
they
wear
to

they
belong
we
can
not
tell

the

who
pass
us
all
clad

who
is

knight
and
who
is

who
is

and
who
is
a

if
we
see
them
in
their
shops
we
can
still
tell
perhaps
for
we
know
that
a
butcher
always
wears
a
blue
apron
and
a
baker
a
white
hat
these
are
but
the
remains
of
a
time
long
ago
when
every
one
dressed
according
to
his
calling
whether
at
work
or
not
it
was
easy
then
to
tell
by
the
cut
and
texture
of
his
clothes
to
what
rank
in
life
a
man
belonged
for
each
dressed
accordingly
and
only
the
great
might
wear
silk
and
velvet
and
golden
ornaments
and
in
the
time
of
which
we
have
been
reading
in
the
england
where
edward
iii
and
richard
ii
ruled
where
langland
sadly
dreamed
and
wyclif
boldly
wrote
and
preached
there
lived
a
man
who
has
left
for
us
a
clear
and
truthful
picture
of
those
times
he
has
left
a
picture
so
vivid
that
as
we
read
his
words
the
people
of
england
of
the
fourteenth
century
still
seem
to
us
to
live
this
man
was
geoffrey
chaucer
chaucer
was
a
poet
and
is
generally
looked
upon
as
the
first
great
english
poet
like
caedmon
he
is
called
the
father
of
english
poetry
and
each
has
a
right
to
the
name
for
if
caedmon
was
the
first
great
poet
of
the
english
people
in
their
new
home
of
england
the
language
he
used
was
the
language
which
chaucer
used
was
english
though
still
not
quite
the
english
which
we
use
but
although
chaucer
was
a
great
poet
we
know
very
little
about
his
life
what
we
do
know
has
nothing
to
do
with
his
poems
or
of
how
he
wrote
them
for
in
those
days
and
for
long
after
a
writer
was
not
expected
to
live
by
his
writing
but
in
return
for
giving
to
the
world
beautiful
thoughts
beautiful
songs
the
king
or
some
great
noble
would
reward
him
by
giving
him
a
post
at
court
about
this
public
life
of
chaucer
we
have
a
few
facts
but
it
is
difficult
at
times
to
fit
the
man
of
camp
and
court
and
to
the
poet
and
who
possessed
a
wealth
of
words
and
a
knowledge
of
how
to
use
them
greater
than
any
englishman
who
had
lived
before
him
and
it
is
rather
through
his
works
than
through
the
scanty
facts
of
his
life
that
we
learn
to
know
the
real
man
full
of
shrewd
knowledge
of
the
world
of
humor
kindliness
and
cheerful
courage
chaucer
was
a
man
of
the
middle
class
his
father
john
chaucer
was
a
london
wine
merchant
the
family
very
likely
came
at
first
from
france
and
the
name
may
mean
shoemaker
from
an
old
norman
word
chaucier
or
chaussier
a
shoemaker
and
although
the
french
word
for
shoemaker
is
different
now
there
is
still
a
slang
word
chausseur
meaning
a
cobbler
we
know
nothing
at
all
of
chaucer
as
a
boy
nothing
of
where
he
went
to
school
nor
do
we
know
if
he
ever
went
to
college
the
first
thing
we
hear
of
him
is
that
he
was
a
page
in
the
house
of
the
princess
elizabeth
the
wife
of
prince
lionel
who
was
the
third
son
of
edward
iii
so
although
chaucer
belonged
to
the
middle
class
he
must
have
had
some
powerful
friend
able
to
get
him
a
place
in
a
great
household
in
those
days
a
boy
became
a
page
in
a
great
household
very
much
as
he
might
now
become
an
in
a
large
office
a
page
had
many
duties
he
had
to
wait
at
table
hold
candles
go
messages
and
do
many
other
little
household
services
such
a
post
seems
strange
to
us
now
yet
it
was
perhaps
quite
as
interesting
as
sitting
all
day
long
on
an
office
stool
in
time
of
war
it
was
certainly
more
exciting
for
a
page
had
often
to
follow
his
master
to
the
battlefield
and
as
a
war
with
france
was
begun
in
geoffrey
went
across
the
channel
with
his
prince
of
what
befell
chaucer
in
france
we
know
nothing
except
that
he
was
taken
prisoner
and
that
the
king
edward
iii
himself
gave
pounds
towards
his
ransom
that
sounds
a
small
sum
but
it
meant
as
much
as
pounds
would
now
so
it
would
seem
that
boy
though
he
was
geoffrey
chaucer
had
already
become
important
perhaps
he
was
already
known
as
a
poet
and
a
good
whom
the
king
was
loath
to
lose
but
again
for
seven
years
after
this
we
hear
nothing
more
about
him
and
when
next
we
do
hear
of
him
he
is
valet
de
chambre
in
the
household
of
edward
iii
then
a
few
years
later
he
married
one
of
queen
philippa
of
chaucer
life
with
his
wife
and
family
again
we
know
nothing
except
that
he
had
at
least
one
son
named
lewis
we
know
this
because
he
wrote
a
book
called
a
treatise
on
the
astrolabe
for
this
little
son
an
astrolabe
was
an
instrument
used
in
astronomy
to
find
out
the
distance
of
stars
from
the
earth
the
position
of
the
sun
and
moon
the
length
of
days
and
many
other
things
about
the
heavens
and
their
bodies
chaucer
calls
his
book
a
treatise
on
the
astrolabe
bread
and
milk
for
children
little
lewis
my
son
he
says
in
the
beginning
i
have
perceived
well
by
certain
evidences
thine
ability
to
learn
science
touching
numbers
and
proportions
and
as
well
consider
i
thy
busy
prayer
in
special
to
learn
the
treatise
of
the
astrolabe
but
although
there
were
many
books
written
on
the
subject
some
were
unknown
in
england
and
some
were
not
to
be
trusted
and
some
of
them
be
too
hard
to
thy
tender
age
of
ten
years
this
treatise
then
will
i
show
thee
under
few
light
rules
and
naked
words
in
english
for
latin
canst
thou
yet
but
small
my
little
son
now
will
i
pray
meekly
every
discreet
person
that
readeth
or
heareth
this
little
treatise
to
have
my
rude
inditing
for
excused
and
my
superfluity
of
words
for
two
causes
the
first
cause
is
for
that
curious
inditing
and
hard
sentence
is
full
heavy
at
one
and
the
same
time
for
a
child
to
learn
and
the
second
cause
is
this
that
soothly
me
seemeth
better
to
write
unto
a
child
twice
a
good
sentence
than
he
forget
it
once
and
lewis
if
so
be
i
shew
you
in
my
easy
english
as
true
conclusions
as
be
shewn
in
latin
grant
me
the
more
thank
and
pray
god
save
the
king
who
is
lord
of
this
english
so
we
see
from
this
that
more
than
five
hundred
years
ago
a
kindly
father
saw
the
need
of
making
simple
books
on
difficult
subjects
for
children
you
may
never
want
to
read
this
book
itself
indeed
few
people
read
it
now
but
i
think
that
we
should
all
be
sorry
to
lose
the
preface
although
it
has
in
it
some
long
words
which
perhaps
a
boy
of
ten
in
our
day
would
still
find
full
heavy
it
is
interesting
too
to
notice
in
this
preface
that
here
chaucer
calls
his
king
lord
of
this
english
we
now
often
speak
of
the
king
english
so
once
again
we
see
how
an
everyday
phrase
links
us
with
the
past
chapter
xxiii
chaucer
the
canterbury
tales
chaucer
rose
in
the
king
service
he
became
an
esquire
and
was
sent
on
business
for
the
king
to
france
and
to
italy
to
italy
he
went
at
least
twice
and
it
is
well
to
remember
this
as
it
had
an
effect
on
his
most
famous
poems
he
must
have
done
his
business
well
for
we
find
him
receiving
now
a
pension
for
life
worth
about
pounds
in
our
money
now
a
grant
of
a
daily
pitcher
of
wine
besides
a
salary
of
a
day
and
two
robes
yearly
chaucer
wife
too
had
a
pension
so
the
poet
was
well
off
he
had
powerful
friends
also
among
them
john
of
gaunt
and
when
the
duke
wife
died
chaucer
wrote
a
lament
which
is
called
the
dethe
of
blaunche
the
duchess
or
sometimes
the
book
of
the
duchess
this
is
one
of
the
earliest
known
poems
of
chaucer
and
although
it
is
not
so
good
as
some
which
are
later
there
are
many
beautiful
lines
in
it
the
poet
led
a
busy
life
he
was
a
good
business
man
and
soon
we
find
him
in
the
civil
service
as
we
would
call
it
now
he
was
made
comptroller
of
customs
and
in
this
post
he
had
to
work
hard
for
one
of
the
conditions
was
that
he
must
write
out
the
accounts
with
his
own
hand
and
always
be
in
the
office
himself
if
we
may
take
some
lines
he
wrote
to
be
about
himself
he
was
so
busy
all
day
long
that
he
had
not
time
to
hear
what
was
happening
abroad
or
even
what
was
happening
among
his
friends
and
neighbors
not
only
from
far
countree
that
there
no
tidings
cometh
to
thee
not
of
thy
very
neighbours
that
dwellen
almost
at
thy
doors
thou
hearest
neither
that
nor
this
yet
after
his
hard
office
work
was
done
he
loved
nothing
better
than
to
go
back
to
his
books
for
he
goes
on
to
say
for
when
thy
labour
done
all
is
and
hast
thy
reckonings
instead
of
rest
and
newë
things
thou
goest
home
to
thy
house
anon
and
all
so
dumb
as
any
stone
thou
sittest
at
another
book
till
fully
dazéd
is
thy
look
and
livest
thus
as
a
hermite
although
thine
abstinence
is
light
but
if
chaucer
loved
books
he
loved
people
too
and
we
may
believe
that
he
readily
made
friends
for
there
was
a
kingly
humor
about
him
that
must
have
drawn
people
to
him
and
that
he
knew
men
and
their
ways
we
learn
from
his
poetry
for
it
is
full
of
knowledge
of
men
and
women
for
many
years
chaucer
was
well
off
and
comfortable
but
he
did
not
always
remain
so
there
came
a
time
when
his
friend
and
patron
john
of
gaunt
fell
from
power
and
chaucer
lost
his
appointments
soon
after
that
his
wife
died
and
with
her
life
her
pension
ceased
so
for
a
year
or
two
the
poet
knew
something
of
poverty
poverty
at
least
compared
to
what
he
had
been
used
to
but
if
he
lost
his
money
he
did
not
lose
his
sunny
temper
and
in
all
his
writings
we
find
little
that
is
bitter
after
a
time
john
of
gaunt
returned
to
power
and
again
chaucer
had
a
post
given
to
him
and
so
until
he
died
he
suffered
ups
and
downs
born
when
edward
iii
was
in
his
highest
glory
chaucer
lived
to
see
him
hated
by
his
people
he
lived
through
the
reign
of
edward
grandson
richard
ii
and
knew
him
from
the
time
when
as
a
gallant
boy
he
had
faced
wat
tyler
and
his
rioters
till
as
a
worn
and
broken
prisoner
he
yielded
the
crown
to
henry
of
lancaster
the
son
of
john
of
gaunt
but
before
the
broken
king
died
in
his
darksome
prison
chaucer
lay
taking
his
last
rest
in
benet
chapel
in
westminster
he
was
the
first
great
poet
to
be
laid
there
but
since
then
there
have
gathered
round
him
so
many
bearing
the
greatest
names
in
english
literature
that
we
call
it
now
the
poet
corner
but
although
chaucer
lived
in
stirring
times
although
he
was
a
soldier
and
a
courtier
he
does
not
in
the
book
by
which
we
know
him
best
write
of
battles
and
of
pomp
of
kings
and
of
princes
in
this
book
we
find
plain
everyday
people
people
of
the
great
middle
class
of
merchants
and
tradesmen
and
others
of
like
calling
to
which
chaucer
himself
belonged
it
was
a
class
which
year
by
year
had
been
growing
more
and
more
strong
in
england
and
which
year
by
year
had
been
making
its
strength
more
and
more
felt
but
it
was
a
class
which
no
one
had
thought
of
writing
about
in
plain
fashion
and
it
is
in
the
canterbury
tales
that
we
have
for
the
first
time
in
the
english
language
pictures
of
real
men
and
what
is
more
wonderful
of
real
women
they
are
not
giants
or
dwarfs
they
are
not
fairy
princes
or
knights
in
shining
armor
they
do
no
wondrous
deeds
of
strength
or
skill
they
are
not
queens
of
marvelous
beauty
or
enchanted
princesses
they
are
simply
plain
english
people
and
yet
they
are
very
interesting
in
chaucer
time
books
although
still
copied
by
hand
had
become
more
plentiful
than
ever
before
and
as
more
and
more
people
learned
to
read
the
singing
time
began
to
draw
to
a
close
stories
were
now
not
all
written
in
rhyme
and
poetry
was
not
all
written
to
be
sung
yet
the
listening
time
was
not
quite
over
for
these
were
still
the
days
of
talk
and
life
went
at
leisure
pace
there
was
no
hurry
there
was
no
machinery
all
sewing
was
done
by
hand
so
when
the
ladies
of
a
great
household
gathered
to
their
handiwork
it
was
no
unusual
thing
for
one
among
them
to
lighten
the
long
hours
with
tales
read
or
told
houses
were
badly
lighted
and
there
was
little
to
do
indoors
in
the
long
winter
evenings
so
the
men
gathered
together
and
listened
while
one
among
them
told
of
love
and
battle
indeed
through
all
the
life
of
the
middle
ages
there
was
room
for
so
now
although
chaucer
meant
his
tales
to
be
read
he
made
believe
that
they
were
told
by
a
company
of
people
on
a
journey
from
london
to
canterbury
he
thus
made
a
framework
for
them
of
the
life
he
knew
and
gave
a
reason
for
them
all
being
told
in
one
book
but
a
reason
had
to
be
given
for
the
journey
for
in
those
days
people
did
not
travel
about
from
place
to
place
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
seeing
another
town
as
we
do
now
few
people
thought
of
going
for
a
change
of
air
nobody
perhaps
ever
thought
about
going
to
the
seaside
for
the
summer
in
short
people
always
had
a
special
object
in
taking
a
journey
one
reason
for
this
was
that
traveling
was
slow
and
often
dangerous
the
roads
were
bad
and
people
nearly
all
traveled
on
horseback
and
in
company
for
robbers
lurked
by
the
way
ready
to
attack
and
kill
for
the
sake
of
their
money
any
who
rode
alone
and
unprotected
so
when
a
man
had
to
travel
he
tried
to
arrange
to
go
in
company
with
others
in
olden
days
the
most
usual
reason
for
a
journey
next
to
business
was
a
pilgrimage
sometimes
this
was
simply
an
act
of
religion
or
devotion
clad
in
a
simple
gown
and
perhaps
with
bare
feet
the
pilgrim
set
out
carrying
a
staff
in
his
hand
and
begging
for
food
and
shelter
by
the
road
he
took
his
way
to
the
shrine
of
some
saint
there
he
knelt
and
prayed
and
felt
himself
blessed
in
the
deed
sometimes
it
was
an
act
of
penance
for
some
great
sin
done
sometimes
of
thanksgiving
for
some
great
good
received
some
great
danger
passed
but
as
time
went
on
these
pilgrimages
lost
their
old
meaning
people
no
longer
trudged
along
barefoot
wearing
a
garb
they
began
to
look
upon
a
pilgrimage
more
as
a
summer
outing
and
dressed
in
their
best
they
rode
comfortably
on
horseback
and
it
is
a
company
of
pilgrims
such
as
this
that
chaucer
paints
for
us
he
describes
himself
as
being
of
the
company
and
it
is
quite
likely
that
chaucer
really
did
at
one
time
go
upon
this
pilgrimage
from
london
to
canterbury
for
it
was
a
very
favorite
one
not
only
was
the
shrine
of
thomas
at
canterbury
very
beautiful
in
those
days
but
it
was
also
within
easy
distance
of
london
neither
costing
much
nor
lasting
long
it
was
a
journey
which
merchantmen
and
others
like
them
could
well
afford
chaucer
tells
us
that
it
was
when
the
first
sunshiny
days
of
april
came
that
people
began
to
think
of
such
pilgrimages
when
that
april
with
his
showers
sweet
the
drought
of
march
hath
pierced
to
the
root
when
the
soft
wind
with
his
sweet
breath
inspired
hath
in
every
holt
and
heath
the
tender
crops
when
the
little
birds
make
new
songs
then
longen
folk
to
go
on
pilgrimages
and
palmers
for
to
seeken
strange
lands
and
especially
from
every
shire
end
of
england
to
canterbury
they
wend
so
one
day
in
april
a
company
of
pilgrims
gathered
at
the
tabard
inn
on
the
south
side
of
the
thames
not
far
from
london
bridge
a
tabard
or
coat
without
sleeves
was
the
sign
of
the
inn
hence
its
name
in
those
days
such
a
coat
would
often
be
worn
by
workmen
for
ease
in
working
but
it
has
come
down
to
us
only
as
the
gayly
colored
coat
worn
by
heralds
at
the
tabard
inn
of
sundry
folk
besides
chaucer
himself
were
gathered
they
were
all
strangers
to
each
other
but
they
were
all
bound
on
the
same
errand
every
one
was
willing
to
be
friendly
with
his
neighbor
and
chaucer
in
his
cheery
way
had
soon
made
friends
with
them
all
and
shortly
when
the
sun
was
to
rest
so
had
i
spoke
with
them
every
one
and
having
made
their
acquaintance
chaucer
begins
to
describe
them
all
so
that
we
may
know
them
too
he
describes
them
so
well
that
he
makes
them
all
living
to
us
some
we
grow
to
love
some
we
smile
upon
and
have
a
kindly
feeling
for
for
although
they
are
not
fine
folk
they
are
so
very
human
we
can
not
help
but
like
them
and
some
we
do
not
like
at
all
for
they
are
rude
and
rough
as
the
poet
meant
them
to
be
chapter
xxiv
chaucer
at
the
tabard
inn
chaucer
begins
his
description
of
the
people
who
were
gathered
at
the
tabard
inn
with
the
knight
who
was
the
highest
in
rank
among
them
a
knight
there
was
and
that
a
worthy
man
and
though
he
was
worthy
he
was
wise
and
of
his
port
as
meek
as
any
maid
he
never
yet
no
villainy
said
in
all
his
life
unto
no
manner
wight
he
was
a
very
perfect
gentle
knight
yet
he
was
no
knight
of
romance
or
fairy
tale
but
a
good
honest
english
gentleman
who
had
fought
for
his
king
his
coat
was
of
fustian
and
was
stained
with
rust
from
his
armor
for
he
had
just
come
back
from
fighting
and
was
still
clad
in
his
clothes
his
horse
was
good
but
he
ne
was
gay
with
the
knight
was
his
son
a
young
squire
of
twenty
years
he
was
gay
and
handsome
with
curling
hair
and
comely
face
his
clothes
were
in
the
latest
fashion
gayly
embroidered
he
sat
his
horse
well
and
guided
it
with
ease
he
was
merry
and
careless
and
clever
too
for
he
could
joust
and
dance
sing
and
play
read
and
write
and
indeed
do
everything
as
a
young
squire
should
yet
with
it
all
courteous
he
was
lowly
and
serviceable
with
these
two
came
their
servant
a
yeoman
clad
in
hood
of
green
and
carrying
besides
many
other
weapons
a
mighty
bow
as
was
natural
in
a
gathering
such
as
this
monks
and
friars
and
their
like
figured
largely
there
was
a
monk
a
worldly
man
fond
of
dress
fond
of
hunting
fond
of
a
good
dinner
and
a
friar
even
more
worldly
and
there
was
a
pardoner
a
man
who
sold
pardons
to
those
who
had
done
wrong
and
a
sumpnour
or
summoner
who
was
so
ugly
and
vile
that
children
were
afraid
of
him
a
summoner
was
a
person
who
went
to
summon
or
call
people
to
appear
before
the
church
courts
when
they
had
done
wrong
he
was
a
person
and
both
he
and
the
pardoner
were
great
rogues
and
cheats
and
had
no
love
for
each
other
there
was
also
a
poor
parson
all
these
except
the
poor
parson
chaucer
holds
up
to
scorn
because
he
had
met
many
such
in
real
life
who
under
the
pretense
of
religion
lived
bad
lives
but
that
it
was
not
the
church
that
he
scorned
or
any
who
were
truly
good
he
shows
by
his
picture
of
the
poor
parson
he
was
poor
in
worldly
goods
but
rich
he
was
in
holy
thought
and
work
he
was
also
a
learned
man
a
clerk
that
christ
gospel
truly
would
preach
his
parishioners
devoutly
would
he
teach
benign
he
was
and
wonder
diligent
and
in
adversity
full
patient
wide
was
his
parish
and
houses
far
asunder
but
he
left
naught
for
rain
nor
thunder
in
sickness
nor
in
mischief
to
visit
the
farthest
of
his
parish
great
or
upon
his
feet
and
in
his
hand
a
staff
the
noble
ensample
to
his
sheep
he
gave
that
first
he
wrought
and
afterward
he
taught
there
was
no
better
parson
anywhere
he
taught
his
people
to
walk
in
christ
way
but
first
he
followed
it
himself
chaucer
gives
this
good
man
a
brother
who
is
a
plowman
a
true
worker
and
a
good
was
he
living
in
peace
and
perfect
charity
he
could
dig
and
he
could
thresh
and
everything
to
which
he
put
his
hand
he
did
with
a
will
besides
all
the
other
religious
folk
there
were
a
prioress
and
a
nun
in
those
days
the
convents
were
the
only
schools
for
fine
ladies
and
the
prioress
perhaps
spent
her
days
teaching
them
chaucer
makes
her
very
prim
and
precise
at
meat
well
taught
was
she
withal
she
let
no
morsel
from
her
lips
fall
nor
wet
her
fingers
in
her
sauce
deep
well
could
she
carry
a
morsel
and
well
keep
that
no
drop
might
fall
upon
her
breast
in
courtesy
was
set
full
mickle
her
lest
her
over
lip
wiped
she
so
clean
that
in
her
cup
there
was
no
morsel
seen
of
grease
when
she
drunken
had
her
draught
should
be
remembered
that
in
those
days
forks
were
unknown
and
people
used
their
fingers
and
she
was
so
tender
hearted
she
would
cry
if
she
saw
a
mouse
caught
in
a
trap
and
she
fed
her
little
dog
on
the
best
of
everything
in
her
dress
she
was
very
dainty
and
particular
and
yet
with
all
her
fine
ways
we
feel
that
she
was
no
true
lady
and
that
ever
so
gently
chaucer
is
making
fun
of
her
besides
the
prioress
and
the
nun
there
was
only
one
other
woman
in
the
company
this
was
the
vulgar
bouncing
wife
of
bath
she
dressed
in
rich
and
gaudy
clothes
she
liked
to
go
about
to
see
and
be
seen
and
have
a
good
time
she
had
been
married
five
times
and
though
she
was
getting
old
and
rather
deaf
she
was
quite
ready
to
marry
again
if
the
husband
she
had
should
die
before
her
chaucer
describes
nearly
every
one
in
the
company
and
last
of
all
he
pictures
for
us
the
host
of
the
tabard
inn
a
seemly
man
our
host
was
withal
for
to
have
been
a
marshal
in
a
hall
a
large
man
he
was
with
eyen
stepe
a
fairer
burgesse
was
there
none
in
chepe
bold
was
his
speech
and
wise
and
well
and
of
manhood
him
lacked
right
naught
eke
thereto
he
was
right
a
merry
man
a
street
in
london
the
host
name
was
harry
baily
a
big
man
and
jolly
fellow
who
dearly
loved
a
joke
after
supper
was
over
he
spoke
to
all
the
company
gathered
there
he
told
them
how
glad
he
was
to
see
them
and
that
he
had
not
had
so
merry
a
company
that
year
then
he
told
them
that
he
had
thought
of
something
to
amuse
them
on
the
long
way
to
canterbury
it
was
this
that
each
of
you
to
shorten
of
your
way
in
this
voyage
shall
tell
tales
to
i
mean
it
so
and
homeward
ye
shall
tellen
other
two
of
adventures
which
whilom
have
befallen
and
which
of
you
the
beareth
you
best
of
all
that
is
to
say
that
telleth
in
this
case
tales
of
best
sentence
and
most
solace
shall
have
a
supper
at
all
our
cost
here
in
this
place
sitting
at
this
post
when
that
we
come
again
fro
canterbury
and
for
to
make
you
the
more
merry
i
will
myself
gladly
with
you
ride
right
at
mine
own
cost
and
be
your
guide
to
this
every
one
willingly
agreed
and
next
morning
they
waked
very
early
and
set
off
and
having
ridden
a
little
way
they
cast
lots
as
to
who
should
tell
the
first
tale
the
lot
fell
upon
the
knight
who
accordingly
began
all
that
i
have
told
you
so
far
forms
the
first
part
of
the
book
and
is
called
the
prologue
which
means
really
before
word
or
explanation
it
is
perhaps
the
most
interesting
part
of
the
book
for
it
is
entirely
chaucer
own
and
it
is
truly
english
it
is
said
that
chaucer
borrowed
the
form
of
his
famous
tales
from
a
book
called
the
decameron
written
by
an
italian
poet
named
boccaccio
decameron
comes
from
two
greek
words
deka
ten
and
hemera
a
day
the
book
being
so
called
because
the
stories
in
it
were
supposed
to
be
told
in
ten
days
during
a
time
of
plague
in
florence
seven
ladies
and
three
gentlemen
fled
and
took
refuge
in
a
house
surrounded
by
a
garden
far
from
the
town
there
they
remained
for
ten
days
and
to
amuse
themselves
each
told
a
tale
every
day
so
that
there
are
a
hundred
tales
in
all
in
the
decameron
it
is
very
likely
that
in
one
of
his
journeys
to
italy
chaucer
saw
this
book
perhaps
he
even
met
boccaccio
and
it
is
more
than
likely
that
he
met
petrarch
another
great
italian
poet
who
also
retold
one
of
the
tales
of
the
decameron
several
of
the
tales
which
chaucer
makes
his
people
tell
are
founded
on
these
tales
indeed
nearly
all
his
poems
are
founded
on
old
french
italian
or
latin
tales
but
although
chaucer
takes
his
material
from
others
he
tells
the
stories
in
his
own
way
and
so
makes
them
his
own
and
he
never
wrote
anything
more
truly
english
in
spirit
than
the
prologue
to
the
canterbury
tales
some
of
these
stories
you
will
like
to
read
but
others
are
too
coarse
and
rude
to
give
you
any
pleasure
even
the
roughness
of
these
tales
however
helps
us
to
picture
the
england
of
those
days
we
see
from
them
how
hard
and
rough
the
life
must
have
been
when
people
found
humor
and
fun
in
jokes
in
which
we
can
feel
only
disgust
but
even
in
chaucer
day
there
were
those
who
found
such
stories
coarse
precious
fold
chaucer
calls
them
he
himself
perhaps
did
not
care
for
them
indeed
he
explains
in
the
tales
why
he
tells
them
here
is
a
company
of
common
everyday
people
he
said
and
if
i
am
to
make
you
see
these
people
if
they
are
to
be
living
and
real
to
you
i
must
make
them
act
and
speak
as
such
common
people
would
act
and
speak
they
are
churls
and
they
must
speak
like
churls
and
not
like
fine
folk
and
if
you
like
the
tale
turn
over
the
leaf
and
choose
another
what
should
i
more
say
but
this
miller
he
would
his
words
for
no
man
forbear
but
told
his
churls
tale
in
his
manner
me
thinketh
that
i
shall
rehearse
it
here
and
therefore
every
gently
wight
i
pray
for
goddes
love
deem
not
that
i
say
of
evil
intent
but
for
i
might
rehearse
their
tales
all
be
they
better
or
worse
or
else
falsen
some
of
my
matter
and
therefore
who
so
listeth
it
not
to
hear
turn
over
the
leaf
and
choose
another
tale
for
he
shall
find
enow
both
great
and
small
in
storial
thing
that
toucheth
gentlesse
and
eke
morality
and
holiness
blame
not
me
if
that
ye
choose
amiss
this
miller
is
a
churl
ye
know
well
so
was
the
reeve
and
many
more
and
wickedness
they
tolden
both
two
advise
you
put
me
out
of
blame
and
eke
men
shall
not
make
earnest
of
game
if
chaucer
had
written
all
the
tales
that
he
meant
to
write
there
would
have
been
one
hundred
and
in
all
but
the
poet
died
long
before
his
work
was
done
and
as
it
is
there
are
only
two
of
these
are
not
finished
one
indeed
is
only
begun
thus
you
see
many
of
the
pilgrims
tell
no
story
at
all
and
we
do
not
know
who
got
the
prize
nor
do
we
hear
anything
of
the
grand
supper
at
the
end
of
the
journey
chaucer
is
the
first
of
our
poets
who
had
a
perfect
sense
of
sound
he
delights
us
not
only
with
his
stories
but
with
the
beauty
of
the
words
he
uses
we
lose
a
great
deal
of
that
beauty
when
his
poetry
is
put
into
modern
english
as
are
all
the
quotations
which
i
have
given
you
it
is
only
when
we
can
read
the
poems
in
the
quaint
english
of
chaucer
time
that
we
can
see
truly
how
fine
it
is
so
although
you
may
begin
to
love
chaucer
now
you
must
look
forward
to
a
time
when
you
will
be
able
to
read
his
stories
as
he
wrote
them
then
you
will
love
them
much
more
chaucer
wrote
many
other
books
beside
the
canterbury
tales
although
not
so
many
as
was
at
one
time
thought
but
the
canterbury
tales
are
the
most
famous
and
i
will
not
trouble
you
with
the
names
even
of
the
others
but
when
the
time
comes
i
hope
that
you
will
want
to
read
some
of
his
other
books
as
well
as
the
canterbury
tales
and
now
just
to
end
this
long
chapter
i
will
give
you
a
little
poem
by
chaucer
written
as
he
wrote
it
with
modern
english
words
underneath
so
that
you
may
see
the
difference
this
poem
was
written
when
chaucer
was
very
poor
it
was
sent
to
king
henry
iv
who
had
just
taken
the
throne
from
richard
ii
henry
answer
was
a
pension
of
twenty
marks
so
that
once
more
chaucer
lived
in
comfort
he
died
however
a
year
later

complaynt
of
chaucer

hys
purse

from
a
french
word

used

it
is

it

you
must
sound
the
final

in

word

edited

in

suitable
only
for
readers
as
there
are
so
many
books
now
published
containing
stories
from
chaucer
canterbury
tales
i
feel
it
unnecessary
to
give
any
here
in
outline
chapter
xxv
the
first
english
and
now
lest
you
should
say
what
still
more
poetry
i
shall
give
you
next
a
chapter
about
a
great
who
wrote
in
prose
we
use
in
two
senses
and
when
we
speak
of
sir
john
mandeville
we
use
it
in
both
he
was
a
great
teller
but
before
saying
anything
about
his
stories
i
must
first
tell
you
that
after
having
been
believed
in
as
a
real
person
for
five
hundred
years
and
more
sir
john
has
at
last
been
found
out
he
never
lived
at
all
and
the
travels
about
which
he
tells
us
so
finely
never
took
place
sir
john
too
used
to
be
called
the
father
of
english
prose
but
even
that
honor
can
not
be
left
to
him
for
his
travels
were
not
written
first
in
english
but
in
french
and
were
afterwards
translated
into
english
but
although
we
know
sir
john
mandeville
was
not
english
that
he
never
saw
the
places
he
describes
that
indeed
he
never
lived
at
all
we
will
still
call
him
by
that
name
for
we
must
call
him
something
and
as
no
one
really
knows
who
wrote
the
book
which
is
known
as
the
voyages
and
travels
of
sir
john
mandeville
we
may
as
well
call
the
author
by
the
name
he
chose
as
by
another
sir
john
then
tells
us
that
he
was
born
in
albans
that
he
was
a
knight
and
that
in
he
set
out
on
his
travels
he
traveled
about
for
more
than
twenty
years
but
at
last
although
in
the
course
of
them
he
had
drunk
of
the
well
of
everlasting
youth
he
became
so
crippled
with
gout
that
he
could
travel
no
longer
he
settled
down
therefore
at
liege
in
belgium
there
he
wrote
his
book
and
there
he
died
and
was
buried
at
any
rate
many
years
afterwards
his
tomb
was
shown
there
it
was
also
shown
at
albans
where
the
people
were
very
proud
of
it
sir
john
great
book
was
a
in
those
days
as
we
know
it
was
a
very
common
thing
for
people
to
go
on
pilgrimages
and
among
the
long
pilgrimages
the
one
to
the
holy
land
was
the
most
common
so
sir
john
wrote
his
book
to
help
people
on
their
way
just
as
baedeker
and
murray
do
now
it
is
perhaps
the
earliest
and
certainly
one
of
the
most
delightful
ever
written
although
really
it
was
chiefly
made
up
of
bits
out
of
books
by
other
people
sir
john
tells
of
many
different
ways
of
getting
to
palestine
and
relates
wonderful
stories
about
the
places
to
be
passed
through
he
wrote
in
french
i
know
that
i
ought
to
write
in
latin
he
says
but
because
more
people
understand
french
i
have
written
in
french
so
that
every
one
may
understand
it
afterwards
it
was
translated
into
latin
later
into
english
and
still
later
into
almost
every
european
language
so
much
did
people
like
the
stories
when
these
stories
appeared
it
was
something
quite
new
in
literature
for
until
this
time
stories
were
always
written
in
poetry
it
was
only
great
and
learned
books
or
books
that
were
meant
to
teach
something
that
were
written
in
prose
here
is
one
of
sir
john
mandeville
tales
after
telling
about
the
tomb
of
john
at
ephesus
sir
john
goes
on
and
then
men
pass
through
the
isles
of
cophos
and
lango
of
the
which
isles
ipocras
was
lord
and
some
say
that
in
the
isle
of
lango
is
ipocras
daughter
in
form
of
a
dragon
it
is
a
hundred
foot
long
so
men
say
but
i
have
not
seen
it
and
they
say
the
people
of
the
isles
call
her
the
lady
of
the
country
and
she
lieth
in
an
old
castle
and
sheweth
herself
thrice
a
year
and
she
doeth
no
man
harm
and
she
is
thus
changed
from
a
lady
to
a
dragon
through
a
goddess
whom
men
call
diana
and
men
say
that
she
shall
dwell
so
until
the
time
that
a
knight
come
that
is
so
hardy
as
to
go
to
her
and
kiss
her
mouth
and
then
shall
she
turn
again
to
her
own
kind
and
be
a
woman
and
after
that
she
shall
not
live
long
and
it
is
not
long
since
a
knight
of
the
island
of
rhodes
that
was
hardy
and
valiant
said
that
he
would
kiss
her
but
when
the
dragon
began
to
lift
up
her
head
and
he
saw
it
was
so
hideous
he
fled
away
then
the
dragon
in
her
anger
bare
the
knight
to
a
rock
and
cast
him
into
the
sea
and
so
he
was
lost
also
a
young
man
that
wist
not
of
the
dragon
went
out
of
a
ship
and
went
through
the
isle
till
he
came
to
a
castle
then
came
he
into
the
cave
and
went
on
till
he
found
a
chamber
and
there
he
saw
a
lady
combing
her
hair
and
looking
in
a
mirror
and
she
had
much
treasure
about
her
he
bowed
to
the
lady
and
the
lady
saw
the
shadow
of
him
in
the
mirror
then
she
turned
towards
him
and
asked
him
what
he
would
and
he
answered
he
would
be
her
lover
then
she
asked
him
if
he
were
a
knight
and
he
said
she
said
then
he
might
not
be
her
lover
but
she
bade
him
go
again
to
his
fellows
and
make
him
knight
and
come
again
on
the
morrow
then
she
would
come
out
of
the
cave
and
he
should
kiss
her
on
the
mouth
and
she
bade
him
have
no
dread
for
she
would
do
him
no
harm
although
she
seemed
hideous
to
him
she
said
it
was
done
by
enchantment
for
she
said
she
was
really
such
as
he
saw
her
then
she
said
too
that
if
he
kissed
her
he
should
have
all
the
treasure
and
be
her
lord
and
lord
of
all
these
isles
then
he
departed
from
her
and
went
to
his
fellows
in
the
ship
and
made
him
knight
and
came
again
on
the
morrow
for
to
kiss
the
damsel
but
when
he
saw
her
come
out
of
the
cave
in
the
form
of
a
dragon
he
had
so
great
dread
that
he
fled
to
the
ship
she
followed
him
and
when
she
saw
that
he
turned
not
again
she
began
to
cry
as
a
thing
that
had
much
sorrow
and
turned
back
again
soon
after
the
knight
died
and
since
hitherto
might
no
knight
see
her
but
he
died
anon
but
when
a
knight
cometh
that
is
so
hardy
to
kiss
her
he
shall
not
die
but
he
shall
turn
that
damsel
into
her
right
shape
and
shall
be
lord
of
the
country
aforesaid
when
sir
john
reaches
palestine
he
has
very
much
to
say
of
the
wonders
to
be
seen
there
at
bethlehem
he
tells
a
story
of
how
roses
first
came
into
the
world
here
it
is
bethlehem
is
but
a
little
city
long
and
narrow
and
well
walled
and
enclosed
with
a
great
ditch
and
it
was
wont
to
be
called
ephrata
as
holy
writ
sayeth
we
heard
it
at
ephrata
and
toward
the
end
of
the
city
toward
the
east
is
a
right
fair
church
and
a
gracious
and
it
hath
many
towers
pinnacles
and
turrets
full
strongly
made
and
within
that
church
are
four
great
pillars
of
marble
and
between
the
church
the
field
flowered
as
ye
shall
hear
the
cause
is
for
as
much
as
a
fair
maiden
was
blamed
with
wrong
for
the
which
cause
she
was
deemed
to
die
and
to
be
burnt
in
that
place
to
the
which
she
was
led
and
as
the
wood
began
to
burn
about
her
she
made
her
prayer
to
our
lord
as
she
was
not
guilty
of
that
thing
that
he
would
help
her
that
her
innocence
might
be
known
to
all
men
and
when
she
had
this
said
she
entered
the
fire
and
anon
the
fire
went
out
and
those
branches
that
were
burning
became
red
roses
and
those
branches
that
were
not
kindled
became
white
roses
and
those
were
the
first
roses
and
that
any
man
saw
and
so
was
the
maiden
saved
through
the
grace
of
god
and
therefore
is
that
field
called
the
field
of
god
flowered
for
it
was
full
of
roses
although
sir
john
begins
his
book
as
a
guide
to
palestine
he
tells
of
many
other
lands
also
and
of
the
wonder
there
of
ethiopia
he
tells
us
on
the
other
side
of
chaldea
toward
the
south
is
ethiopia
a
great
land
in
this
land
in
the
south
are
the
people
right
black
in
that
side
is
a
well
that
in
the
day
the
water
is
so
cold
that
no
man
may
drink
thereof
and
in
the
night
it
is
so
hot
that
no
man
may
suffer
to
put
his
hand
in
it
in
this
land
the
rivers
and
all
the
waters
are
troublous
and
some
deal
salt
for
the
great
heat
and
men
of
that
land
are
easily
made
drunken
and
have
little
appetite
for
meat
they
have
commonly
great
illness
of
body
and
live
not
long
in
ethiopia
are
such
men
as
have
one
foot
and
they
walk
so
fast
that
it
is
a
great
marvel
and
that
is
a
large
foot
that
the
shadow
thereof
covereth
the
body
from
sun
and
rain
when
they
lie
upon
their
backs
sir
john
tells
us
too
of
a
wonderful
group
of
islands
and
in
one
of
these
isles
are
men
that
have
one
eye
and
that
in
the
midst
of
their
forehead
and
they
eat
not
flesh
or
fish
all
raw
and
in
another
isle
dwell
men
that
have
no
heads
and
their
eyes
are
in
their
shoulders
and
their
mouth
is
in
their
breast
and
in
another
isle
are
men
that
have
flat
faces
without
nose
and
without
eyes
but
they
have
two
small
round
holes
instead
of
eyes
and
they
have
a
flat
mouth
without
lips
and
in
another
isle
are
men
that
have
the
lips
about
their
mouth
so
great
that
when
they
sleep
in
the
sun
they
cover
all
their
face
with
the
lip
but
i
must
not
tell
all
the
lying
wonders
of
our
english
knight
for
you
must
read
the
book
for
yourselves
and
when
you
do
you
will
find
that
it
is
written
with
such
an
easy
air
of
truth
that
you
will
half
believe
in
sir
john
marvels
every
now
and
again
too
he
puts
in
a
bit
of
real
information
which
helps
to
make
his
marvels
seem
true
so
that
sometimes
we
can
not
be
sure
what
is
truth
and
what
is
fable
sir
henry
yule
the
book
of
sir
marco
polo
sir
john
wandered
far
and
long
but
at
last
his
journeyings
ended
i
have
passed
through
many
lands
and
isles
and
countries
he
says
and
now
am
come
to
rest
against
my
will
and
so
to
find
comfort
in
his
wretched
rest
he
wrote
his
book
but
he
says
there
are
many
other
divers
countries
and
many
other
marvels
beyond
that
i
have
not
seen
also
in
countries
where
i
have
been
there
are
many
marvels
that
i
speak
not
of
for
it
were
too
long
a
tale
and
also
he
thought
it
was
as
well
to
leave
something
untold
so
that
other
men
that
go
thither
may
find
enough
for
to
say
that
i
have
not
told
which
was
very
kind
of
him
sir
john
tells
us
then
how
he
took
his
book
to
the
holy
father
the
pope
and
how
he
caused
it
to
be
read
and
the
pope
hath
ratified
and
affirmed
my
book
in
all
points
and
i
pray
to
all
those
that
read
this
book
that
they
will
pray
for
me
and
i
shall
pray
for
them
books
to
read
the
voyages
and
travels
of
sir
john
mandeville
edited
chapter
xxvi
barbour
the
bruce
the
beginnings
of
a
struggle
while
chaucer
was
making
for
us
pictures
of
english
life
in
the
sister
kingdom
across
the
rugged
cheviots
another
poet
was
singing
to
a
ruder
people
this
poet
was
john
barbour
archdeacon
of
aberdeen
an
older
man
than
chaucer
born
perhaps
twenty
years
before
the
english
poet
he
died
only
five
years
earlier
so
that
for
many
years
these
two
lived
and
wrote
at
the
same
time
but
the
book
by
which
barbour
is
remembered
best
is
very
different
from
that
by
which
we
remember
chaucer
book
is
called
the
bruce
and
in
it
instead
of
the
quiet
tales
of
people
we
hear
throughout
the
clash
and
clang
of
battle
here
once
again
we
have
the
hero
of
romance
here
once
again
history
and
story
are
mingled
and
robert
the
bruce
swings
his
and
wings
his
faultless
arrow
saving
his
people
from
the
english
yoke
the
music
of
the
bruce
can
not
compare
with
the
music
of
the
tales
but
the
spirit
throughout
is
one
of
manliness
of
delight
in
noble
deeds
and
noble
thoughts
barbour
way
of
telling
his
stories
is
simple
and
straightforward
it
is
full
of
stern
battle
yet
there
are
lines
of
tender
beauty
but
nowhere
do
we
find
anything
like
the
quiet
laughter
and
humor
of
chaucer
and
that
is
not
wonderful
for
those
were
stern
times
in
scotland
and
the
bruce
is
as
much
an
outcome
of
those
times
as
were
the
tales
or
piers
ploughman
an
outcome
of
the
times
in
england
but
if
to
chaucer
belongs
the
title
of
father
of
english
poetry
to
barbour
belongs
that
of
father
of
scottish
poetry
and
scottish
history
he
indeed
calls
the
language
he
wrote
in
inglis
but
it
is
a
different
english
from
that
of
chaucer
they
were
both
founded
on
but
instead
of
growing
into
modern
english
barbour
tongue
grew
into
what
was
known
later
as
braid
scots
all
the
quotations
that
i
am
going
to
give
you
from
the
poem
i
have
turned
into
modern
english
for
although
they
lose
a
great
deal
in
beauty
it
makes
them
easier
for
every
one
to
understand
for
even
to
the
scots
boys
and
girls
who
read
this
book
there
are
many
words
in
the
original
that
would
need
translating
although
they
are
words
still
used
by
every
one
who
speaks
scots
to
this
day
in
one
page
of
lines
taken
at
random
we
find
sixteen
such
words
they
are
micht
nicht
lickt
weel
gane
ane
nane
stane
rowit
mirk
nocht
brocht
mair
sperit
at
sair
hert
for
those
who
are
scots
it
is
interesting
to
know
how
little
the
language
of
the
people
has
changed
in
five
hundred
years
as
of
many
another
of
our
early
poets
we
know
little
of
barbour
life
he
was
archdeacon
of
aberdeen
as
already
said
and
in
he
received
a
from
edward
iii
to
allow
him
to
travel
to
oxford
with
three
companions
in
those
days
there
was
not
as
yet
any
university
in
scotland
the
monasteries
still
held
their
place
as
centers
of
learning
but
already
the
fame
of
oxford
had
reached
the
northern
kingdom
and
barbour
was
anxious
to
share
in
the
treasures
of
learning
to
be
found
there
at
the
moment
there
was
peace
between
the
two
countries
but
hate
was
not
dead
it
only
slumbered
so
a
or
passport
was
necessary
for
any
scotsman
who
would
travel
through
england
in
safety
edward
the
king
unto
his
lieges
greeting
it
ran
know
ye
that
we
have
taken
under
our
protection
at
the
request
of
david
de
bruce
john
barbour
archdeacon
of
aberdeen
with
the
scholars
in
his
company
in
coming
into
our
kingdom
of
england
in
order
to
study
in
the
university
of
oxford
and
perform
his
scholastic
exercises
and
in
remaining
there
and
in
returning
to
his
own
country
of
scotland
and
we
hereby
grant
him
our
conduct
which
is
to
continue
in
force
for
one
year
barbour
was
given
two
other
one
to
allow
him
again
to
visit
oxford
and
another
to
allow
him
to
pass
through
england
on
his
way
to
france
besides
this
we
know
that
barbour
received
a
pension
from
the
king
of
scotland
and
that
he
held
his
archdeaconry
until
his
death
and
that
is
almost
all
that
we
know
certainly
of
his
life
the
bruce
is
the
great
national
poem
robert
the
bruce
the
great
national
hero
of
scotland
but
although
the
bruce
concerns
scotland
in
the
first
place
it
is
of
interest
to
every
one
for
it
is
full
of
thrilling
stories
of
knightly
deeds
many
of
which
are
true
the
fine
poem
deserves
to
be
better
known
says
one
of
its
editors
it
is
a
proud
thing
for
a
country
to
have
given
a
subject
for
such
an
odyssey
and
to
have
had
so
early
in
its
literature
a
poet
worthy
to
celebrate
it
and
it
is
little
wonder
that
barbour
wrote
so
stirringly
of
his
hero
for
he
lived
not
many
years
after
the
events
took
place
and
when
he
was
a
schoolboy
robert
the
bruce
was
still
reigning
over
scotland
innes
in
the
beginning
of
his
book
barbour
says
stories
to
read
are
delightful
supposing
even
they
be
naught
but
fable
then
should
stories
that
true
were
and
that
were
said
in
good
manner
have
double
pleasantness
in
hearing
the
first
pleasantness
is
the
telling
and
the
other
is
the
truthfulness
that
shows
the
thing
right
as
it
was
and
such
things
that
are
likand
to
man
hearing
are
pleasant
therefore
i
would
fain
set
my
will
if
my
wit
may
suffice
thereto
to
put
in
writ
a
truthful
story
that
it
last
aye
forth
in
memory
so
that
no
time
of
length
it
let
nor
gar
it
wholly
be
forgot
so
he
will
he
says
tell
the
tale
of
stalwart
folk
that
lived
erst
while
of
king
robert
of
scotland
that
hardy
was
of
heart
and
hand
and
of
sir
james
of
douglas
that
in
his
time
so
worthy
was
that
his
fame
reached
into
far
lands
then
he
ends
this
preface
with
a
prayer
that
god
will
give
him
grace
so
that
i
say
naught
but
soothfast
thing
the
story
begins
with
describing
the
state
of
scotland
after
the
death
of
alexander
iii
when
edward
i
ruled
in
england
alexander
had
been
a
good
king
but
at
his
death
the
heir
to
the
throne
was
a
little
girl
the
maid
of
norway
she
was
not
even
in
scotland
but
was
far
across
the
sea
and
as
this
came
sailing
to
her
kingdom
she
died
on
board
ship
and
so
never
saw
the
land
over
which
she
ruled
then
came
a
sad
time
for
scotland
the
land
six
year
and
more
lay
desolate
for
there
was
no
other
near
heir
to
the
throne
and
thirteen
nobles
claimed
it
at
last
as
they
could
not
agree
which
had
the
best
right
they
asked
king
edward
of
england
to
decide
for
them
as
you
know
it
had
been
the
dream
of
every
king
of
england
to
be
king
of
scotland
too
and
now
edward
i
saw
his
chance
to
make
that
dream
come
true
he
chose
as
king
the
man
who
had
perhaps
the
greatest
right
to
the
throne
john
balliol
but
he
made
him
promise
to
hold
the
crown
as
a
vassal
to
the
king
of
england
this
however
the
scots
would
not
suffer
freedom
they
had
ever
loved
and
freedom
they
would
have
no
man
they
said
whether
he
were
chosen
king
or
no
had
power
to
make
them
thralls
of
england
oh
freedom
is
a
noble
thing
freedom
makes
a
man
to
have
liking
freedom
all
solace
to
man
gives
he
lives
at
ease
that
freely
lives
a
noble
heart
may
have
no
ease
nor
nothing
else
that
may
him
please
if
freedom
faileth
for
free
delight
is
desired
before
all
other
thing
nor
he
that
aye
has
livéd
free
may
not
know
well
the
quality
the
anger
nor
the
wretched
doom
that
joinéd
is
to
foul
thraldom
so
sang
barbour
and
so
the
passionate
hearts
of
the
scots
cried
through
all
the
wretched
years
that
followed
the
crowning
of
john
balliol
and
when
at
last
they
had
greatest
need
a
leader
arose
to
show
them
the
way
to
freedom
robert
the
bruce
throwing
off
his
sloth
and
forgetfulness
of
his
country
became
their
king
and
hero
he
was
crowned
and
received
the
homage
of
his
barons
but
well
he
knew
that
was
but
the
beginning
to
maintain
what
he
had
begun
he
wist
ere
all
the
land
was
won
he
should
find
full
hard
bargaining
with
him
that
was
of
england
king
for
there
was
none
in
life
so
fell
so
stubborn
nor
so
cruel
then
began
a
long
struggle
between
two
gallant
men
robert
of
scotland
and
edward
of
england
at
first
things
went
ill
with
the
bruce
he
lost
many
men
in
battle
others
forsook
him
and
for
a
time
he
lived
a
hunted
outlaw
among
the
hills
he
durst
not
to
the
plains
for
all
the
commons
went
him
fro
that
for
their
lives
were
full
fain
to
pass
to
the
english
peace
again
but
in
all
his
struggles
bruce
kept
a
good
heart
and
comforted
his
men
discomfort
as
then
said
he
the
worst
thing
that
may
be
for
through
mickle
discomforting
men
fall
oft
into
despairing
and
if
a
man
despairing
be
then
truly
vanquished
is
he
yet
even
while
bruce
comforted
his
men
he
bade
them
be
brave
and
said
and
if
that
them
were
set
a
choice
to
die
or
to
live
cowardly
they
should
ever
die
chivalrously
he
told
them
stories
too
of
the
heroes
of
olden
times
who
after
much
suffering
had
in
the
end
won
the
victory
over
their
enemies
thus
the
days
passed
and
winter
settled
down
on
the
bleak
mountains
then
the
case
of
robert
and
his
men
grew
worse
and
worse
and
they
almost
lost
hope
but
at
length
with
many
adventures
the
winter
came
to
an
end
spring
returned
again
and
with
spring
hope
chapter
xxvii
barbour
the
bruce
the
end
of
the
struggle
was
in
spring
when
winter
tide
with
his
blasts
terrible
to
bide
was
overcome
and
birdies
small
as
throstle
and
the
nightingale
began
right
merrily
to
sing
and
to
make
in
their
singing
sundrie
notes
and
varied
sounds
and
melody
pleasant
to
hear
and
the
trees
began
to
blow
with
buds
and
bright
blossom
also
to
win
the
covering
of
their
heads
which
wicked
winter
had
them
riven
and
every
grove
began
to
spring
it
was
in
spring
that
bruce
and
his
men
gathered
to
the
island
of
arran
off
the
west
coast
of
scotland
and
there
bruce
made
up
his
mind
to
make
another
fight
for
the
crown
a
messenger
was
therefore
sent
over
to
the
mainland
and
it
was
arranged
that
if
he
found
friends
there
if
he
thought
it
was
safe
for
the
king
to
come
he
should
at
a
certain
place
light
a
great
fire
as
a
signal
anxiously
bruce
watched
for
the
light
and
at
last
he
saw
it
then
joyfully
the
men
launched
their
boat
and
the
king
and
his
few
faithful
followers
set
out
they
rowéd
fast
with
all
their
might
till
that
upon
them
fell
the
night
that
it
wox
in
great
manner
so
that
they
wist
not
where
they
were
for
they
no
needle
had
nor
stone
but
rowéd
always
in
one
way
steering
always
upon
the
fire
that
they
saw
burning
bright
and
clear
it
was
but
adventure
that
them
led
and
they
in
short
time
so
them
sped
that
at
the
fire
arrived
they
and
went
to
land
mair
delay
on
shore
the
messenger
was
eagerly
and
anxiously
awaiting
them
and
with
a
sare
hert
he
told
the
king
that
the
fire
was
none
of
his
far
from
there
being
friends
around
the
english
he
said
swarmed
in
all
the
land
were
in
the
castle
there
beside
full
filléd
of
despite
and
pride
there
was
no
hope
of
success
then
said
the
king
in
full
great
ire
why
made
thou
on
the
fire
sire
he
said
god
me
see
that
fire
was
never
made
on
for
me
no
ere
this
night
i
wist
it
not
but
when
i
wist
it
i
thoecht
that
you
and
all
your
company
in
haste
would
put
you
to
the
sea
for
this
i
come
to
meet
you
here
to
tell
the
perils
that
may
appear
the
king
vexed
and
disappointed
turned
to
his
followers
for
advice
what
was
best
to
do
he
asked
edward
bruce
the
brave
brother
was
the
first
to
answer
and
said
say
you
sickerly
there
shall
no
perils
that
may
be
drive
me
eftsoons
into
the
sea
mine
adventure
here
take
will
i
whether
it
be
easeful
or
angry
he
said
you
will
so
it
is
good
that
we
together
take
disease
and
ease
or
pain
or
play
after
as
god
will
us
purvey
and
so
taking
courage
they
set
out
in
the
darkness
and
attacked
the
town
and
took
it
with
great
slaughter
in
such
afray
they
bode
that
night
till
in
the
morn
that
day
was
bright
and
then
ceaséd
partly
the
noise
the
slaughter
and
the
cry
thus
once
again
the
fierce
struggle
was
begun
but
this
time
the
bruce
was
successful
from
town
after
town
from
castle
after
castle
the
enemy
was
driven
out
till
only
stirling
was
left
to
the
english
it
was
near
this
town
on
the
field
of
bannockburn
that
the
last
great
struggle
took
place
brave
king
edward
i
was
dead
by
this
time
but
his
son
edward
ii
led
the
army
it
was
the
greatest
army
that
had
ever
entered
scotland
but
the
scots
won
the
day
and
won
freedom
at
the
same
time
i
can
not
tell
you
of
this
great
battle
nor
of
all
the
adventures
which
led
up
to
it
these
you
must
read
in
other
books
one
day
i
hope
in
barbour
bruce
itself
from
the
day
of
bannockburn
barbour
tells
us
robert
the
bruce
grew
great
his
men
were
rich
and
his
country
abounded
well
with
corn
and
cattle
and
of
all
kind
other
richness
mirth
solace
and
eke
blithness
was
in
the
land
all
commonly
for
ilk
man
blith
was
and
jolly
and
here
barbour
ends
the
first
part
of
his
poem
in
the
second
part
he
goes
on
to
tell
us
of
how
the
bruces
carried
war
into
ireland
of
how
they
overran
northumberland
and
of
how
at
length
true
peace
was
made
then
king
robert
little
son
david
who
was
but
five
was
married
to
joan
the
sister
of
king
edward
iii
thus
after
war
came
rest
and
ease
to
both
countries
but
king
robert
did
not
live
long
to
enjoy
his
rest
he
died
and
all
the
land
was
filled
with
mourning
and
sorrow
our
defense
they
said
and
he
that
all
our
comfort
was
our
wit
and
all
our
governing
is
brought
alas
here
to
ending
alas
what
shall
we
do
or
say
for
in
life
while
he
lasted
aye
by
all
our
foes
dred
were
we
and
in
many
a
far
country
of
our
worship
ran
the
renown
and
that
was
all
for
his
person
barbour
ends
his
book
by
telling
of
how
the
douglas
set
out
to
carry
the
heart
of
the
bruce
to
palestine
and
of
how
he
fell
fighting
in
spain
and
of
how
his
dead
body
and
the
king
heart
were
brought
back
to
scotland
barbour
was
born
about
six
years
after
the
battle
of
bannockburn
as
a
boy
he
must
have
heard
many
stories
of
these
stirring
times
from
those
who
had
taken
part
in
them
he
must
have
known
many
a
woman
who
had
lost
husband
or
father
in
the
great
struggle
he
may
even
have
met
king
robert
himself
and
as
a
boy
he
must
have
shared
in
the
sorrow
that
fell
upon
the
land
when
its
hero
died
he
must
have
remembered
when
he
grew
up
how
the
people
mourned
when
the
dead
body
of
the
douglas
and
the
heart
of
the
gallant
bruce
were
brought
home
from
spain
but
in
spite
of
prayer
to
be
kept
from
saying
ought
but
soothfast
thing
we
must
not
take
the
bruce
too
seriously
if
king
robert
was
a
true
king
he
was
also
a
true
hero
of
romance
we
must
not
take
all
the
bruce
as
serious
history
but
while
allowing
for
the
truth
of
much
we
must
also
allow
something
for
the
poet
worship
of
his
hero
a
hero
too
who
lived
so
near
the
time
in
which
he
wrote
we
must
allow
something
for
the
feelings
of
a
poet
who
so
passionately
loved
the
freedom
for
which
that
hero
fought
books
to
read
there
is
so
far
as
i
know
no
modernized
version
of
the
bruce
but
there
are
many
books
illustrative
of
the
text
in
this
connection
may
be
read

xxviii
a
poet
king
the
bruce
is
a
book
which
is
the
outcome
of
the
history
of
the
times
it
is
the
outcome
of
the
quarrels
between
england
and
scotland
and
of
scotland
struggle
for
freedom
now
we
come
to
another
poet
and
another
poem
which
was
the
outcome
of
the
quarrels
between
england
and
scotland
for
although
freedom
was
never
again
in
danger
the
quarrels
between
the
two
countries
were
unhappily
not
over
in
as
we
know
henry
iv
wrested
the
crown
of
england
from
richard
ii
the
new
king
proved
no
friend
to
scotland
for
he
desired
as
those
before
him
had
desired
to
rule
both
countries
henry
lost
no
chance
therefore
by
which
he
might
gain
his
end
so
when
in
the
king
of
scotland
sent
his
little
son
james
to
be
educated
in
france
the
english
attacked
the
ship
in
which
he
sailed
and
took
him
prisoner
instead
then
of
going
as
a
guest
to
the
court
of
france
the
prince
was
carried
as
a
prisoner
to
the
court
of
england
when
the
old
king
heard
the
sad
news
he
died
and
james
captive
though
he
was
became
king
of
scotland
those
were
again
troublous
times
in
scotland
the
captive
uncle
was
chosen
as
regent
to
rule
in
his
absence
but
he
wishing
to
rule
himself
had
no
desire
that
his
nephew
should
be
set
free
so
through
the
reigns
of
henry
iv
and
of
henry
v
james
remained
a
prisoner
but
although
a
prisoner
he
was
not
harshly
treated
and
the
kings
of
england
took
care
that
he
should
receive
an
education
worthy
of
a
prince
james
was
taught
to
read
and
write
english
french
and
latin
he
was
taught
to
fence
and
wrestle
and
indeed
to
do
everything
as
a
knight
should
prince
james
was
a
willing
pupil
he
loved
his
books
and
looked
forward
to
the
coming
of
his
teachers
who
lightened
the
loneliness
of
his
prison
but
says
a
frenchman
who
has
written
a
beautiful
little
book
about
this
captive
king
walls
do
not
a
prison
make
nor
iron
bars
a
cage
the
soul
of
the
child
who
grew
to
be
a
youth
was
never
a
prisoner
behind
the
thick
walls
of
the
tower
built
long
ago
by
the
conqueror
he
studied
guards
watched
over
him
but
his
spirit
was
far
away
voyaging
in
the
realms
of
poetry
and
in
these
thought
journeys
sitting
at
his
little
window
with
a
big
book
upon
his
knee
he
visited
the
famous
places
which
the
gesta
romanorum
unrolled
before
him
the
boece
taught
him
resignation
william
de
lorris
took
him
by
the
hand
and
led
him
to
the
garden
of
the
rose
the
illustrious
chaucer
invited
him
to
follow
the
gay
troop
of
pilgrims
along
the
highroad
to
canterbury
the
grave
gower
announcing
in
advance
a
sermon
of
several
hours
begged
him
to
be
seated
and
to
the
murmur
of
his
wise
talk
his
head
leaning
on
the
window
frame
the
child
slept
peacefully
thus
passed
the
years
and
the
chief
change
that
they
brought
was
a
change
of
prison
after
the
tower
it
was
the
castle
of
nottingham
another
citadel
of
the
norman
time
then
evesham
then
again
the
tower
when
henry
v
came
to
the
throne
and
at
last
and
this
was
by
contrast
almost
liberty
the
castle
of
windsor
jusserand
le
roman
roi
and
thus
for
eighteen
years
the
prince
lived
a
life
the
gray
days
followed
each
other
without
change
without
adventure
but
the
brilliant
throng
of
kings
and
queens
of
knights
and
ladies
of
pilgrims
and
lovers
and
all
the
believe
people
of
storyland
stood
out
all
the
brighter
for
the
grayness
of
the
background
and
perhaps
to
the
prince
in
his
quiet
tower
the
storied
people
were
more
real
than
the
living
who
only
now
and
again
came
to
visit
him
for
the
storied
people
were
with
him
always
while
the
living
came
and
went
again
and
were
lost
to
him
in
the
great
world
without
of
which
he
knew
scarce
anything
but
at
last
across
this
twilight
life
which
was
more
than
half
a
dream
there
struck
one
day
a
flash
of
sunshine
then
to
the
patient
studious
prisoner
all
was
changed
life
was
no
longer
a
twilight
dream
but
real
he
knew
how
deep
joy
might
be
how
sharp
sorrow
life
was
worth
living
he
learned
freedom
worth
having
and
at
length
freedom
came
and
the
prince
returned
to
his
country
a
free
king
and
a
happy
lover
how
all
this
happened
king
james
has
told
us
himself
in
a
book
called
the
king
quair
which
means
the
king
little
book
which
he
wrote
while
he
was
still
a
prisoner
in
england
king
james
tells
us
how
one
night
he
could
not
sleep
try
as
he
might
he
lay
tossing
and
tumbling
but
sleep
for
craft
on
earth
might
i
no
more
so
at
last
knowing
no
better
wile
he
took
a
book
hoping
to
borrow
a
sleep
by
reading
but
instead
of
bringing
sleep
the
book
only
made
him
more
and
more
wide
awake
at
length
he
says
mine
eyen
gan
to
smart
for
studying
my
book
i
shut
and
at
my
head
it
laid
and
down
i
lay
any
tarrying
again
he
lay
thinking
and
tossing
upon
his
bed
until
he
was
weary
then
i
listened
suddenly
and
soon
i
heard
the
bell
to
matins
ring
and
up
i
rose
no
longer
would
i
lie
but
now
how
trow
ye
such
a
fantasy
fell
me
to
mind
that
aye
methought
the
bell
said
to
me
on
man
what
thee
befell
thought
i
tho
to
myself
may
this
be
this
is
mine
own
imagining
it
is
no
that
speaketh
unto
me
it
is
a
bell
or
that
impression
of
my
thought
causeth
this
illusion
that
maketh
me
think
so
nicely
in
this
wise
and
so
befell
as
i
shall
you
devise
person
prince
james
says
he
had
already
wasted
much
ink
and
paper
on
writing
yet
at
the
bidding
of
the
bell
he
decided
to
write
some
new
thing
so
up
he
rose
and
my
pen
in
hand
i
took
and
made
a
and
thus
began
my
book
prince
james
then
tells
of
his
past
life
of
how
when
he
was
a
lad
his
father
sent
him
across
the
sea
in
a
ship
and
of
how
he
was
taken
prisoner
and
found
himself
in
straight
ward
and
strong
prison
without
comfort
in
sorrow
and
there
full
often
he
bemoaned
his
fate
asking
what
crime
was
his
that
he
should
be
shut
up
within
four
walls
when
other
men
were
free
bewailing
in
my
chamber
thus
alone
despairing
of
all
joy
and
remedy
out
wearied
with
my
thought
and
woe
begone
unto
the
window
gan
i
walk
in
haste
to
see
the
world
and
folk
that
went
forbye
as
for
the
time
though
i
of
mirths
food
might
have
no
more
to
look
it
did
me
good
beneath
the
tower
in
which
the
prince
was
imprisoned
lay
a
beautiful
garden
it
was
set
about
with
hawthorn
hedges
and
juniper
bushes
and
on
the
small
green
branches
sat
a
little
nightingale
which
sang
so
loud
and
clear
that
all
the
garden
and
the
walls
rang
right
with
the
song
prince
james
leaned
from
his
window
listening
to
the
song
of
the
birds
and
watching
them
as
they
hopped
from
branch
to
branch
preening
themselves
in
the
early
sunshine
and
twittering
to
their
mates
and
as
he
watched
he
envied
the
birds
and
wondered
why
he
should
be
a
thrall
while
they
were
free
and
therewith
cast
i
down
mine
eyes
again
whereas
i
saw
walking
under
the
tower
full
secretly
new
coming
her
to
play
the
fairest
and
the
freshest
young
flower
that
ever
i
saw
methought
before
that
hour
for
which
sudden
abate
anon
astart
the
blood
of
all
my
body
to
my
heart
a
lovely
lady
was
walking
in
the
garden
a
lady
more
lovely
than
he
had
dreamed
any
one
might
be
her
hair
was
golden
and
wreathed
with
flowers
her
dress
was
rich
and
jewels
sparkled
on
her
white
throat
spellbound
he
stood
a
while
watching
the
lovely
lady
he
could
do
nothing
but
gaze
no
wonder
was
for
why
my
wits
all
were
so
overcome
with
pleasance
and
delight
only
through
letting
of
mine
eyes
down
fall
that
suddenly
my
heart
became
her
thrall
for
ever
of
free
will
thus
from
the
first
moment
in
which
he
saw
her
james
loved
the
beautiful
lady
after
a
few
minutes
he
drew
in
his
head
lest
she
might
see
him
and
be
angry
with
him
for
watching
her
but
soon
he
leaned
out
again
for
while
she
was
in
the
garden
he
felt
he
must
watch
and
see
her
walk
so
womanly
so
he
stood
still
at
the
window
and
although
the
lady
was
far
off
in
the
garden
and
could
not
hear
him
he
whispered
to
her
telling
of
his
love
o
sweet
he
said
are
you
an
earthly
creature
or
are
you
a
goddess
how
shall
i
do
reverence
to
you
enough
for
i
love
you
and
you
if
you
will
not
love
me
too
why
then
have
you
come
have
you
but
come
to
add
to
the
misery
of
a
poor
prisoner
prince
james
looked
and
longed
and
sighed
and
envied
the
little
dog
with
which
the
lovely
lady
played
then
he
scolded
the
little
birds
because
they
sang
no
more
where
are
the
songs
you
chanted
this
morning
he
asked
why
do
you
not
sing
now
do
you
not
see
that
the
most
beautiful
lady
in
all
the
world
is
come
into
your
garden
then
to
the
nightingale
he
cried
lift
up
thine
heart
and
sing
with
good
intent
if
thou
would
sing
well
ever
in
thy
life
here
is
the
time
here
is
the
time
or
else
never
then
it
seemed
to
the
prince
as
if
in
answer
to
his
words
all
the
birds
sang
more
sweetly
than
ever
before
and
what
they
sang
was
a
to
his
lady
and
she
walking
under
the
tender
green
of
the
may
trees
looked
upward
and
listened
to
their
sweet
songs
while
james
watched
her
and
loved
her
more
and
more
and
when
she
walkéd
had
a
little
while
under
the
sweet
green
boughs
bent
her
fair
fresh
face
as
white
as
any
snow
she
turnéd
has
and
forth
her
ways
went
but
then
began
my
sickness
and
torment
to
see
her
go
and
follow
i
not
might
methought
the
day
was
turnéd
into
night
then
indeed
the
day
was
dark
for
the
prince
the
beautiful
lady
in
going
had
left
him
more
lonely
than
before
now
he
truly
knew
what
it
was
to
be
a
prisoner
all
day
long
he
knelt
at
the
window
watching
and
longing
and
not
knowing
by
what
means
he
might
see
his
lady
again
at
last
night
came
and
worn
out
in
heart
and
mind
he
leaned
his
head
against
the
cold
rough
stone
and
slept
chapter
xxix
the
death
of
the
poet
king
as
prince
james
slept
he
dreamed
that
a
sudden
great
light
shone
into
his
prison
making
bright
all
the
room
a
voice
cried
i
bring
thee
comfort
and
healing
be
not
afraid
then
the
light
passed
as
suddenly
as
it
had
come
and
the
prince
went
forth
from
his
prison
no
man
saying
him
nay
and
hastily
by
both
the
arms
twain
i
was
araiséd
up
into
the
air
caught
in
a
cloud
of
crystal
clear
and
fair
and
so
through
air
and
water
and
hot
fire
he
was
carried
seeing
and
hearing
many
wonders
till
he
awoke
to
find
himself
still
kneeling
by
his
window
was
it
all
a
dream
prince
james
asked
himself
even
the
vision
of
the
lovely
lady
in
the
garden
at
that
thought
his
heart
grew
heavy
then
as
if
to
comfort
him
a
dove
flew
in
at
his
window
carrying
in
her
mouth
a
sprig
of
gilliflowers
upon
the
stalk
in
golden
letters
were
written
the
words
awake
awake
lover
i
bring
thee
glad
news
and
so
the
story
had
a
happy
ending
for
prince
james
knew
that
the
lovely
lady
of
the
garden
loved
him
and
if
you
think
he
says
that
i
have
written
a
great
deal
about
a
very
little
thing
i
say
this
to
you
who
that
from
hell
hath
creepéd
once
to
heaven
would
after
one
thank
for
joy
not
make
six
or
seven
and
every
wight
his
own
sweet
or
sore
has
most
in
mind
i
can
say
you
no
more
then
in
an
outburst
of
joy
he
thanks
and
blesses
everything
that
has
led
up
to
this
happy
day
which
has
brought
him
under
love
yoke
which
easy
is
and
sure
even
his
exile
and
his
prison
he
thanks
and
thankéd
be
the
fair
castle
wall
whereas
i
whilcome
looked
forth
and
leant
the
king
quair
reminds
us
very
much
of
chaucer
work
all
through
it
there
are
lines
which
might
have
been
written
by
chaucer
and
in
the
last
verse
james
speaks
of
gower
and
chaucer
as
his
masters
dear
of
gower
i
have
said
nothing
in
this
book
because
there
is
not
room
to
tell
of
every
one
and
he
is
not
so
important
as
some
or
so
interesting
as
others
so
i
leave
you
to
learn
about
him
later
it
is
to
chaucer
too
much
more
than
to
gower
that
james
owes
his
music
and
if
he
is
grave
like
gower
rather
than
merry
like
chaucer
we
must
remember
that
for
nineteen
years
he
had
lived
a
captive
so
that
it
was
natural
his
verse
should
be
somber
as
his
life
had
been
and
though
there
is
no
laughter
in
this
poem
it
shows
a
power
of
feeling
joy
as
well
as
sorrow
which
makes
us
sad
when
we
remember
how
long
the
poet
was
shut
away
from
common
human
life
the
king
quair
is
written
in
verses
of
seven
lines
chaucer
used
this
kind
of
verse
but
because
king
james
used
it
too
and
used
it
so
well
it
came
to
be
called
the
rhyme
royal
king
james
story
had
a
happy
ending
a
story
with
a
happy
ending
must
end
of
course
with
a
wedding
and
so
did
this
one
the
king
of
england
now
henry
vi
was
only
a
child
but
those
who
ruled
for
him
were
quite
pleased
when
they
heard
that
prince
james
had
fallen
in
love
with
the
beautiful
lady
of
the
garden
for
she
was
the
king
cousin
lady
jane
beaufort
they
set
james
free
and
willingly
consented
that
he
should
marry
his
lady
for
in
this
way
they
hoped
to
bind
england
and
scotland
together
and
put
an
end
to
wars
between
the
two
countries
so
there
was
a
very
grand
wedding
in
london
when
the
lovely
lady
of
the
garden
became
queen
of
scotland
and
then
these
two
a
king
and
queen
yet
happy
as
any
simple
lovers
journeyed
northward
to
their
kingdom
they
were
received
with
great
rejoicing
and
crowned
at
scone
but
the
new
king
soon
found
that
during
the
long
years
he
had
been
kept
a
prisoner
in
england
his
kingdom
had
fallen
into
wild
disorder
sternly
he
set
himself
to
bring
order
out
of
disorder
and
the
wilfull
lawless
nobles
soon
found
to
their
surprise
that
the
gentle
poet
had
a
will
of
iron
and
a
hand
of
steel
and
that
he
could
wield
a
sword
and
scepter
as
skillfully
as
his
pen
james
i
righted
much
that
was
wrong
in
doing
it
he
made
for
himself
many
enemies
but
of
all
that
he
did
or
tried
to
do
in
the
twelve
years
that
he
ruled
you
will
read
in
history
books
here
i
will
only
tell
you
of
his
sad
death
in
james
decided
to
spend
christmas
at
perth
a
town
he
loved
as
he
neared
the
river
forth
which
he
had
to
cross
on
his
way
an
aged
woman
came
to
him
crying
in
a
loud
voice
my
lord
king
if
ye
cross
this
water
ye
shall
never
return
again
in
life
now
the
king
had
read
a
prophecy
in
which
it
was
said
that
a
king
of
scotland
should
be
slain
that
same
year
so
wondering
what
this
woman
might
mean
he
sent
a
knight
to
speak
with
the
woman
but
the
knight
could
make
nothing
of
her
and
returning
to
the
king
he
said
sir
take
no
heed
of
yon
woman
words
for
she
is
old
and
foolish
and
wots
not
what
she
sayeth
so
the
king
rode
on
christmas
went
by
quietly
and
peacefully
and
the
new
year
came
and
still
the
king
lingered
in
perth
the
winter
days
passed
pleasantly
in
reading
walking
and
the
evenings
in
music
and
but
one
night
as
james
was
chatting
and
laughing
with
the
queen
and
her
ladies
before
going
to
bed
a
great
noise
was
heard
the
sound
of
many
feet
the
clatter
of
armor
mingled
with
wild
cries
was
borne
to
the
quiet
room
and
through
the
high
windows
flashed
the
light
of
many
torches
at
once
the
king
guessed
that
he
was
betrayed
the
queen
and
her
ladies
ran
hastily
to
the
door
to
shut
it
but
the
locks
had
been
broken
and
the
bolts
carried
away
so
that
it
could
not
be
fastened
in
vain
james
looked
round
way
of
escape
there
was
none
alone
unarmed
he
could
neither
guard
the
ladies
nor
save
himself
crying
to
them
to
keep
fast
the
door
as
best
they
might
he
sprang
to
the
window
hoping
by
his
great
strength
to
wrench
the
iron
bars
from
their
places
and
escape
that
way
but
alas
they
were
so
strongly
set
in
the
stone
that
he
could
not
move
them
for
which
cause
the
king
was
ugly
astonied
dethe
of
the
kynge
of
scottis
then
turning
to
the
fire
james
seized
the
tongs
and
under
his
feet
he
mightily
brast
up
a
blank
of
the
chamber
and
leaping
down
into
the
vault
beneath
he
let
the
plank
fall
again
into
its
place
by
this
vault
the
king
might
have
escaped
for
until
three
days
before
there
had
been
a
hole
leading
from
it
to
the
open
air
but
as
he
played
tennis
his
balls
often
rolled
into
this
hole
and
were
lost
so
he
had
ordered
it
to
be
built
up
same
there
was
nothing
then
for
the
king
to
do
but
wait
meanwhile
the
noise
grew
louder
and
louder
the
traitors
came
nearer
and
nearer
one
brave
lady
named
catherine
douglas
hoping
to
keep
them
out
and
so
save
the
king
thrust
her
arm
through
the
iron
loops
on
the
door
where
the
great
bolt
should
have
been
but
against
the
savage
force
without
her
frail
white
arm
was
useless
the
door
was
burst
open
wounded
and
bleeding
catherine
douglas
was
thrown
aside
and
the
wild
horde
stormed
into
the
room
it
was
not
long
ere
the
king
was
found
and
one
of
the
traitors
leaped
down
beside
him
with
a
great
knife
in
his
hand
and
the
king
doubting
him
for
his
life
caught
him
mightily
by
the
shoulders
and
with
full
great
violence
cast
him
under
his
feet
for
the
king
was
of
his
person
and
stature
a
man
right
manly
strong
same
seeing
this
another
traitor
leaped
down
to
help
his
fellow
and
the
king
caught
him
manly
by
the
neck
both
under
him
that
all
a
long
month
after
men
might
see
how
strongly
the
king
had
holden
them
by
the
throats
same
fiercely
the
king
struggled
with
his
enemies
trying
to
wrench
their
knives
from
them
so
that
he
might
defend
himself
but
it
was
in
vain
seeing
him
grow
weary
a
third
traitor
the
greatest
enemy
robert
grahame
leaped
down
too
into
the
vault
with
a
horrible
and
mortal
weapon
in
his
hand
and
therewithal
he
smote
him
through
the
body
and
therewithal
the
good
king
fell
down
same
and
thus
the
poet
king
died
with
sixteen
wounds
in
his
brave
heart
and
many
more
in
his
body
so
at
the
long
last
our
story
has
a
sad
ending
but
we
have
to
remember
that
for
twelve
years
king
james
had
a
happy
life
and
that
as
he
had
loved
his
lady
at
the
first
so
he
loved
her
to
the
end
and
was
true
to
her
besides
the
king
quair
there
are
a
few
other
short
poems
which
some
people
think
king
james
wrote
they
are
very
different
from
the
quair
being
more
like
the
ballads
of
the
people
and
most
people
think
now
that
james
did
not
write
them
but
because
they
are
different
is
no
real
reason
for
thinking
that
they
are
not
his
for
james
was
quite
clever
enough
we
may
believe
to
write
in
more
than
one
way
besides
these
doubtful
poems
there
is
one
other
poem
of
three
verses
about
which
no
one
has
any
doubt
i
will
give
you
one
verse
here
for
it
seems
in
tune
with
the
king
own
life

death

books
to

be
read
in
the
fair

by
sir
walter

the
king
tragedy

in
his
poetical
works
the

version
of
the
quair
in
the
ancient
text
is
by
skeat
chapter
xxx
dunbar
the
wedding
of
the
thistle
and
the
rose
the
fifteenth
century
the
century
in
which
king
james
i
reigned
and
died
has
been
called
the
golden
age
of
scottish
poetry
because
of
the
number
of
poets
who
lived
and
wrote
then
and
so
although
i
am
only
going
to
speak
of
one
other
scottish
poet
at
present
you
must
remember
that
there
were
at
this
time
many
more
but
of
them
all
william
dunbar
is
counted
the
greatest
and
although
i
do
not
think
you
will
care
to
read
his
poems
for
a
very
long
time
to
come
i
write
about
him
here
both
because
he
was
a
great
poet
and
because
with
one
of
his
poems
the
thistle
and
the
rose
he
takes
us
back
as
it
were
over
the
border
into
england
once
more
william
dunbar
was
perhaps
born
in
and
began
his
life
when
james
iii
began
his
reign
he
was
of
noble
family
but
there
is
little
to
know
about
his
life
and
as
with
chaucer
what
we
learn
about
the
man
himself
we
learn
chiefly
from
his
writing
we
know
however
that
he
went
to
the
university
of
andrews
and
that
it
was
intended
that
he
should
go
into
the
church
in
those
days
in
scotland
there
were
only
two
things
a
gentleman
might
be
either
he
must
be
a
soldier
or
a
priest
dunbar
friends
perhaps
seeing
that
he
was
fond
of
books
thought
it
best
to
make
him
a
priest
but
indeed
he
had
made
a
better
soldier
for
a
time
however
although
he
was
quite
unsuited
for
such
a
life
he
became
a
friar
as
a
preaching
friar
he
wandered
far
for
in
every
town
and
place
of
all
england
from
berwick
to
calais
i
have
in
my
habit
made
good
cheer
in
friar
weed
full
fairly
have
i
fleichet
in
it
have
i
in
pulpit
gone
and
preached
in
dernton
kirk
and
eke
in
canterbury
in
it
i
passed
at
dover
the
ferry
through
picardy
and
there
the
people
teached
dunbar
himself
knew
that
he
had
no
calling
to
be
a
friar
or
preacher
he
confesses
that
as
long
as
i
did
bear
the
friar
style
in
me
god
wot
was
many
wrink
and
wile
in
me
was
falseness
every
wight
to
flatter
which
might
be
banished
by
no
holy
water
i
was
aye
ready
all
men
to
beguile
so
after
a
time
we
find
him
no
longer
a
friar
but
a
courtier
soon
we
find
him
like
chaucer
being
sent
on
business
to
the
continent
for
his
king
james
iv
like
chaucer
he
receives
pensions
like
chaucer
too
he
knows
sometimes
what
it
is
to
be
poor
and
he
has
left
more
than
one
poem
in
which
he
prays
the
king
to
remember
his
old
and
faithful
servant
and
not
leave
him
in
want
we
find
him
also
begging
the
king
for
a
church
living
for
although
he
had
no
mind
to
be
a
friar
he
wanted
a
living
perhaps
merely
that
he
might
be
sure
of
a
home
in
his
old
age
but
for
some
reason
the
king
never
gave
him
what
he
asked
we
have
nearly
ninety
poems
of
dunbar
none
of
them
very
long
but
although
he
is
a
far
better
poet
than
barbour
or
even
perhaps
than
james
i
he
is
not
for
you
so
interesting
in
the
meantime
first
his
language
is
very
hard
to
understand
one
reason
for
this
is
that
he
knows
so
many
words
and
uses
them
all
he
language
had
at
large
says
one
of
his
fellow
poets
and
countrymen
and
so
although
his
thought
is
always
clear
it
is
not
always
easy
to
follow
it
through
his
strange
words
second
his
charm
as
a
poet
lies
not
so
much
in
what
he
tells
not
so
much
in
his
story
as
in
the
way
that
he
tells
it
and
so
even
if
you
are
already
beginning
to
care
for
words
and
the
way
in
which
they
are
used
you
may
not
yet
care
so
much
that
you
can
enjoy
poetry
written
in
a
tongue
which
to
us
is
almost
a
foreign
tongue
but
if
some
day
you
care
enough
about
it
to
master
this
poet
you
will
find
that
there
is
a
wonderful
variety
in
his
poems
he
can
be
glad
and
sad
tender
and
fierce
sometimes
he
seems
to
smile
gently
upon
the
sins
and
sorrows
of
his
day
at
other
times
he
pours
forth
upon
them
words
of
savage
scorn
grim
and
terrible
but
when
we
take
all
his
work
together
we
find
that
we
have
such
a
picture
of
the
times
in
which
he
lived
as
perhaps
only
chaucer
besides
has
given
us
david
lyndsay
for
us
the
most
interesting
poem
is
the
thistle
and
the
rose
this
was
written
when
margaret
the
daughter
of
king
henry
vii
of
england
came
to
be
the
wife
of
king
james
iv
of
scotland
dunbar
was
the
rhymer
of
scotland
that
is
the
of
his
day
and
so
as
was
natural
he
made
a
poem
upon
this
great
event
for
a
is
the
king
poet
and
it
is
his
duty
to
make
poems
on
all
the
great
things
that
may
happen
to
the
king
for
this
he
receives
a
certain
amount
of
money
and
a
cask
of
wine
every
year
but
it
is
the
honor
and
not
the
reward
which
is
now
prized
dunbar
begins
by
telling
us
that
he
lay
dreaming
one
may
morning
you
will
find
when
you
come
to
read
much
of
the
poetry
of
those
days
that
poets
were
very
fond
of
making
use
of
a
dream
by
which
to
tell
a
story
it
was
then
a
may
morning
when
dunbar
lay
asleep
when
march
was
with
varying
winds
past
and
april
had
with
her
silver
showers
tane
leave
of
nature
with
an
orient
blast
and
pleasant
may
that
mother
is
of
flowers
had
made
the
birds
to
begin
their
among
the
tender
arbours
red
white
whose
harmony
to
hear
it
was
delight
morning
prayers
then
it
seemed
that
may
in
the
form
of
a
beautiful
lady
stood
beside
his
bed
she
called
to
him
sluggard
awake
anon
for
shame
and
in
mine
honor
go
write
something
quoth
i
shall
i
wuprise
at
morrow
for
in
this
may
few
birdies
heard
i
sing
have
more
cause
to
weep
and
plain
their
sorrow
thy
air
it
is
not
wholesome
or
benign
nevertheless
rise
said
may
and
so
the
lazy
poet
rose
and
followed
the
lady
into
a
lovely
garden
here
he
saw
many
wonderful
and
beautiful
sights
he
saw
all
the
birds
and
beasts
and
flowers
in
the
world
pass
before
dame
nature
then
calléd
she
all
flowers
that
grew
in
field
discerning
all
their
fashions
and
properties
upon
the
awful
thistle
she
beheld
and
saw
him
by
a
bush
of
spears
considering
him
so
able
for
the
wars
a
radiant
crown
of
rubies
she
him
gave
and
said
field
go
forth
and
fend
the
lave
and
since
thou
art
a
king
be
thou
discreet
herb
without
virtue
hold
thou
not
of
such
price
as
herb
of
virtue
and
of
odour
sweet
and
let
no
nettle
vile
and
full
of
vice
mate
him
to
the
goodly
nor
let
no
wild
weed
full
of
churlishness
compare
her
to
the
lily
nobleness
nor
hold
thou
no
other
flower
in
such
dainty
as
the
fresh
rose
of
colour
red
and
white
for
if
thou
dost
hurt
is
thine
honesty
considering
that
no
flower
is
so
perfect
so
full
of
virtue
pleasance
and
delight
so
full
of
blissful
angelic
beauty
imperial
birth
honour
and
dignity
others
by
the
thistle
of
course
dunbar
means
james
iv
and
by
the
rose
the
princess
margaret
then
to
the
rose
dame
nature
spoke
and
crowned
her
with
a
costly
crown
with
shining
rubies
bright
when
that
was
done
all
the
flowers
rejoiced
crying
out
hail
be
thou
richest
rose
then
all
the
birds
the
thrush
the
lark
the
nightingale
cried
hail
and
the
common
voice
uprose
of
birdies
small
till
all
the
garden
rang
with
joy
then
all
the
birdies
sang
with
such
a
shout
that
i
anon
awoke
where
that
i
lay
and
with
a
start
i
turnéd
me
about
to
see
this
court
but
all
were
went
away
then
up
i
leanéd
half
yet
in
fear
and
thus
i
wrote
as
ye
have
heard
to
forrow
of
lusty
may
upon
the
nineth
morrow
already
thus
did
dunbar
sing
of
the
wedding
of
the
thistle
and
the
rose
it
was
a
marriage
by
which
the
two
peoples
hoped
once
more
to
bring
a
lasting
peace
between
the
two
countries
and
although
the
hope
was
not
at
once
fulfilled
it
was
a
hundred
years
later
for
upon
the
death
of
elizabeth
james
vi
of
scotland
the
grandson
of
margaret
tudor
and
james
stuart
received
the
crown
of
england
also
thus
joining
the
two
rival
countries
then
came
the
true
marriage
of
the
thistle
and
the
rose
meanwhile
as
long
as
henry
vii
remained
upon
the
throne
there
was
peace
between
the
two
peoples
but
when
henry
viii
began
to
rule
his
of
scotland
soon
found
cause
to
quarrel
with
him
then
once
again
the
thistle
and
the
rose
met
not
in
peace
but
in
war
on
the
red
field
of
flodden
once
again
the
blood
of
a
scottish
king
stained
the
grass
once
again
scotland
was
plunged
in
tears
after
that
most
dolent
day
we
hear
no
more
of
dunbar
it
is
thought
by
some
that
he
as
many
another
knight
courtier
and
priest
laid
down
his
life
fighting
for
his
king
and
that
he
fell
on
flodden
field
by
others
it
is
thought
that
he
lived
to
return
to
scotland
and
that
the
queen
gave
to
him
one
of
the
now
many
vacant
church
livings
and
that
there
he
spent
his
last
days
in
quietness
and
peace
david
lyndsay
this
may
have
been
so
for
although
dunbar
makes
no
mention
of
flodden
in
his
poems
it
is
possible
that
he
may
have
done
so
in
some
that
are
lost
but
where
this
great
poet
lies
taking
his
last
rest
we
do
not
know
it
may
be
he
was
laid
in
some
quiet
country
churchyard
it
may
be
he
met
death
suddenly
amid
the
din
and
horror
of
battle
books
to
read
in
illustration
of
this
chapter
may
be
read
edinburgh
after
flodden
in
lays
of
the
scottish
cavaliers
by
aytoun
the
best
edition
of
the
poems
of
dunbar
in
the
original
is
edited
by
j
small
chapter
xxxi
at
the
sign
of
the
red
pale
if
the
fifteenth
century
has
been
called
the
golden
age
of
scottish
poetry
it
was
also
the
dullest
age
in
english
literature
during
the
fifteenth
century
few
books
were
written
in
england
one
reason
for
this
was
that
in
england
it
was
a
time
of
foreign
and
of
civil
war
the
century
opened
in
war
with
wales
it
continued
in
war
with
france
then
for
thirty
years
the
wars
of
the
roses
laid
desolate
the
land
they
ended
at
length
in
with
bosworth
field
by
which
henry
vii
became
king
but
in
spite
of
all
the
wars
and
strife
the
making
of
books
did
not
quite
cease
and
if
only
a
few
books
were
written
it
was
because
it
was
a
time
of
rebirth
and
new
life
as
well
as
a
time
of
war
and
death
for
it
was
in
the
fifteenth
century
that
printing
was
discovered
then
it
was
that
the
listening
time
was
really
done
men
began
to
use
their
eyes
rather
than
their
ears
they
saw
as
they
had
never
before
seen
books
began
to
grow
many
and
cheap
more
and
more
people
learned
to
read
and
this
helped
to
settle
our
language
into
a
form
that
was
to
last
french
still
although
it
was
no
longer
the
language
of
the
court
or
of
the
people
had
an
influence
on
our
speech
people
traveled
little
and
in
different
parts
of
the
country
different
dialects
which
were
almost
like
different
languages
were
spoken
we
have
seen
that
the
inglis
of
scotland
differed
from
chaucer
english
and
the
language
of
the
north
of
england
differed
from
it
just
as
much
but
when
printed
books
increased
in
number
quickly
when
every
man
could
see
for
himself
what
the
printed
words
looked
like
these
differences
began
to
die
out
then
our
english
as
a
literary
language
was
born
it
was
caxton
you
remember
who
was
the
first
english
printer
we
have
already
heard
of
him
when
following
the
arthur
story
as
the
printer
of
malory
morte
but
caxton
was
not
only
a
printer
he
was
author
editor
printer
publisher
and
bookseller
all
in
one
william
caxton
as
he
himself
tells
us
was
born
in
kent
in
the
weald
but
exactly
where
or
when
we
do
not
know
although
it
may
have
been
about
the
year
neither
do
we
know
who
or
what
his
father
was
some
people
think
that
he
may
have
been
a
mercer
or
cloth
merchant
because
later
caxton
was
apprenticed
to
one
of
the
richest
cloth
merchants
of
london
in
those
days
no
man
was
allowed
to
begin
business
for
himself
until
he
had
served
for
a
number
of
years
as
an
apprentice
when
he
had
served
his
time
and
then
only
was
he
admitted
into
the
company
and
allowed
to
trade
for
himself
as
the
mercers
company
was
one
of
the
wealthiest
and
most
powerful
of
the
merchant
companies
they
were
very
careful
of
whom
they
admitted
as
apprentices
therefore
it
would
seem
that
really
caxton
family
was
of
great
repute
of
old
and
as
an
old
manuscript
says
caxton
master
died
before
he
had
finished
his
apprenticeship
so
he
had
to
find
a
new
master
and
very
soon
he
left
england
and
went
to
bruges
there
he
remained
for
years
in
those
days
there
was
much
trade
between
england
and
flanders
belgium
we
now
call
the
country
in
wool
and
cloth
and
there
was
a
little
colony
of
english
merchants
in
bruges
there
caxton
steadily
rose
in
importance
until
he
became
governor
of
the
english
nation
beyond
the
seas
as
governor
he
had
great
power
and
ruled
over
his
merchant
adventurers
as
if
he
had
been
a
king
but
even
with
all
his
other
work
with
his
trading
and
ruling
to
attend
to
caxton
found
time
to
read
and
write
and
he
began
to
translate
from
the
french
a
book
of
stories
called
the
of
the
histories
of
troy
this
is
a
book
full
of
the
stories
of
greek
heroes
and
of
the
ancient
town
of
troy
from
the
french
word
recueillir
to
gather
caxton
was
not
very
well
pleased
with
his
work
however
he
fell
into
despair
of
it
he
says
and
for
two
years
he
put
it
aside
and
wrote
no
more
in
princess
margaret
the
sister
of
king
edward
iv
married
the
duke
of
burgundy
and
came
to
live
in
flanders
for
in
those
days
flanders
was
under
the
rule
of
the
dukes
of
burgundy
princess
margaret
soon
heard
of
the
englishman
william
caxton
who
had
made
his
home
in
bruges
she
liked
him
and
encouraged
him
to
go
on
with
his
writing
and
after
a
time
he
gave
up
his
post
of
governor
of
the
english
and
entered
the
service
of
the
princess
we
do
not
know
what
post
caxton
held
in
the
household
of
the
princess
but
it
was
one
of
honor
we
may
feel
sure
it
was
at
the
bidding
of
the
princess
whose
dreadful
command
i
durst
in
no
wise
disobey
that
caxton
finished
the
translation
of
his
book
of
stories
and
as
at
this
time
there
were
no
stories
written
in
english
prose
poetry
only
being
still
used
for
stories
the
book
was
a
great
success
the
duchess
was
delighted
and
rewarded
caxton
well
and
besides
that
so
many
other
people
wished
to
read
it
that
he
soon
grew
tired
of
making
copies
it
was
then
that
he
decided
to
learn
the
new
and
wonderful
art
of
printing
which
was
already
known
in
flanders
so
it
came
about
that
the
first
book
ever
printed
in
english
was
not
printed
in
england
but
somewhere
on
the
continent
it
was
printed
some
time
before
perhaps
in
if
in
manuscript
the
book
had
been
a
success
it
was
now
much
more
of
one
and
we
may
believe
that
it
was
this
success
that
made
caxton
leave
bruges
and
go
home
to
england
in
order
to
begin
life
anew
as
a
printer
there
many
a
time
as
governor
of
the
english
nation
over
the
seas
he
had
sent
forth
richly
laden
vessels
but
had
he
known
it
none
was
so
richly
laden
as
that
which
now
sailed
homeward
bearing
a
at
westminster
within
the
precincts
of
the
abbey
caxton
found
a
house
and
set
up
his
and
there
not
far
from
the
great
west
door
of
the
abbey
he
already
an
elderly
man
began
his
new
busy
life
his
house
came
to
be
known
as
the
house
of
the
red
pale
from
the
sign
that
he
set
up
it
was
probably
a
shield
with
a
red
line
down
the
middle
of
it
called
in
heraldry
a
pale
and
from
here
caxton
sent
out
the
first
printed
advertisement
known
in
england
if
it
please
any
man
spiritual
or
temporal
he
says
to
buy
a
certain
book
let
him
come
to
westminster
in
to
the
almonry
at
the
red
pale
and
he
shall
have
them
good
cheap
the
advertisement
ended
with
some
latin
words
which
we
might
translate
please
do
not
pull
down
the
advertisement
the
first
book
that
caxton
is
known
to
have
printed
in
england
was
called
the
and
sayings
of
the
philosophers
this
was
also
a
translation
from
french
not
however
of
caxton
own
writing
it
was
translated
by
earl
rivers
who
asked
caxton
to
revise
it
which
he
did
adding
a
chapter
and
writing
a
prologue
word
for
sayings
from
the
french
dire
to
say
to
the
people
of
caxton
day
printing
seemed
a
marvelous
thing
so
marvelous
did
it
seem
that
some
of
them
thought
it
could
only
be
done
by
the
help
of
evil
spirits
it
is
strange
to
think
that
in
those
days
when
anything
new
and
wonderful
was
discovered
people
at
once
thought
that
it
must
be
the
work
of
evil
spirits
that
it
might
be
the
work
of
good
spirits
never
seemed
to
occur
to
them
printing
indeed
was
a
wonderful
thing
for
now
instead
of
taking
weeks
and
months
to
make
one
copy
of
a
book
a
man
could
make
dozens
or
even
hundreds
at
once
and
this
made
books
so
cheap
that
many
more
people
could
buy
them
and
so
people
were
encouraged
both
to
read
and
write
instead
of
gathering
together
to
hear
one
man
read
out
of
a
book
each
man
could
buy
a
copy
for
himself
at
the
end
of
one
of
his
books
caxton
begs
folk
to
notice
that
it
is
not
written
with
pen
and
ink
as
other
books
be
to
the
end
that
every
man
may
have
them
at
once
for
all
the
books
of
this
story
called
the
recuyell
of
the
histories
of
troy
thus
imprinted
as
ye
see
here
were
begun
on
one
day
and
also
finished
in
one
day
we
who
live
in
a
world
of
books
can
hardly
grasp
what
that
meant
to
the
people
of
caxton
time
for
fourteen
years
caxton
lived
a
busy
life
translating
editing
and
printing
besides
that
he
must
have
led
a
busy
social
life
for
he
was
a
favorite
with
edward
iv
and
with
his
successors
richard
iii
and
henry
vii
too
great
nobles
visited
his
workshop
sent
him
gifts
and
eagerly
bought
and
read
his
books
the
wealthy
merchants
his
old
companions
in
trade
were
glad
still
to
claim
him
as
a
friend
great
ladies
courted
flattered
and
encouraged
him
he
married
too
and
had
children
though
we
known
nothing
of
his
home
life
altogether
his
days
were
full
and
busy
and
we
may
believe
that
he
was
happy
but
at
length
caxton
useful
busy
life
came
to
an
end
on
the
last
day
of
it
he
was
still
translating
a
book
from
french
he
finished
it
only
a
few
hours
before
he
died
we
know
this
although
we
do
not
know
the
exact
date
of
his
death
for
his
pupil
and
follower
who
carried
on
his
work
afterwards
says
on
the
of
this
book
that
it
was
finished
at
the
last
day
of
his
life
caxton
was
buried
in
the
church
near
which
he
had
worked
margaret
westminster
he
was
laid
to
rest
with
some
ceremony
as
a
man
of
importance
for
in
the
of
the
parish
we
find
these
entries
at
burying
of
william
caxton
for
four
torches
for
the
bell
at
same
burying
this
was
much
more
than
was
usually
spent
at
the
burial
of
ordinary
people
in
those
days
among
the
many
books
which
caxton
printed
we
must
not
forget
sir
thomas
malory
morte
which
we
spoke
of
out
of
its
place
in
following
the
story
of
arthur
in
chapter
viii
perhaps
you
would
like
to
turn
back
and
read
it
over
again
now
as
we
have
said
caxton
was
not
merely
a
printer
he
was
an
author
too
but
although
he
translated
books
both
from
french
and
dutch
it
is
perhaps
to
his
delightful
prefaces
more
than
to
anything
else
that
he
owes
his
title
of
author
yet
it
must
be
owned
that
sometimes
they
are
not
all
quite
his
own
but
parts
are
taken
wholesale
from
other
men
works
or
are
translated
from
the
french
we
are
apt
to
look
upon
a
preface
as
something
dull
which
may
be
left
unread
but
when
you
come
to
read
books
you
may
perhaps
like
his
prefaces
as
much
as
anything
else
about
them
in
one
he
tells
of
his
difficulties
about
the
language
because
different
people
spoke
it
so
differently
he
tells
how
once
he
began
to
translate
a
book
but
when
i
saw
the
fair
and
strange
terms
therein
i
doubted
that
it
should
not
please
some
gentlemen
which
late
blamed
me
saying
that
in
my
translation
i
had
over
curious
terms
which
could
not
be
understood
by
common
people
and
desired
me
to
use
old
and
homely
terms
in
my
translations
and
fain
would
i
satisfy
every
man
and
so
to
do
i
took
an
old
book
and
read
therein
and
certainly
the
english
was
so
rude
and
broad
that
i
could
not
well
understand
it
and
certainly
our
language
now
used
varieth
far
from
that
which
was
used
and
spoken
when
i
was
born
and
that
common
english
that
is
spoken
in
one
shire
varyeth
from
another
that
in
my
days
it
happened
that
certain
merchants
were
in
a
ship
in
thames
for
to
have
sailed
over
the
sea
into
zealand
for
lack
of
wind
they
tarried
at
foreland
and
went
to
land
for
to
refresh
them
and
one
of
them
named
sheffield
a
mercer
came
into
a
house
and
asked
for
meat
and
especially
he
asked
for
eggs
and
the
good
wife
answered
that
she
could
speak
no
french
and
the
merchant
was
angry
for
he
also
could
speak
no
french
but
would
have
had
eggs
and
she
understood
him
not
and
then
at
last
another
said
that
he
would
have
eyren
then
the
good
wife
said
that
she
understood
him
well
so
what
should
a
man
in
these
days
now
write
eggs
or
eyren
certainly
it
is
hard
to
please
every
man
by
cause
of
diversity
and
change
of
language
and
some
honest
and
great
clerks
have
been
with
me
and
desired
me
to
write
the
most
curious
terms
that
i
could
find
and
thus
between
plain
rude
and
curious
i
stand
abashed
but
in
my
judgement
the
common
terms
that
be
daily
used
be
lighter
to
be
understood
than
the
old
and
ancient
english
in
another
book
caxton
tells
us
that
he
knows
his
own
simpleness
and
unperfectness
in
both
french
and
english
for
in
france
was
i
never
and
was
born
and
learned
my
english
in
kent
in
the
weald
where
i
doubt
not
is
spoken
as
broad
and
rude
english
as
in
any
place
in
england
so
you
see
our
english
was
by
no
means
yet
settled
but
printing
perhaps
did
more
than
anything
else
to
settle
it
we
know
that
caxton
printed
at
least
one
hundred
and
two
editions
of
books
and
you
will
be
surprised
to
hear
that
of
all
these
only
two
or
three
were
books
of
poetry
here
we
have
a
sure
sign
that
the
singing
time
was
nearly
over
i
do
not
mean
that
we
are
to
have
no
more
singers
for
most
of
our
greatest
are
still
to
come
but
from
this
time
prose
had
shaken
off
its
fetters
it
was
no
longer
to
be
used
only
for
sermons
for
prayers
for
teaching
it
was
to
take
its
place
beside
poetry
as
a
means
of
enjoyment
as
literature
literature
then
was
no
longer
the
affair
of
the
and
the
but
of
a
man
own
fireside
and
quiet
study
it
was
no
longer
the
affair
of
the
crowd
but
of
each
man
to
himself
alone
the
chief
poems
which
caxton
printed
were
chaucer
in
one
place
he
calls
chaucer
the
worshipful
father
and
first
founder
and
embellisher
of
ornate
eloquence
in
our
english
here
i
think
he
shows
that
he
was
trying
to
follow
the
advice
of
those
honest
and
great
clerks
who
told
him
he
should
write
the
most
curious
terms
that
he
could
find
but
certainly
he
admired
chaucer
very
greatly
in
the
preface
to
his
second
edition
of
the
canterbury
tales
he
says
great
thank
laud
and
honour
ought
to
be
given
unto
the
clerks
poets
and
others
who
have
written
noble
books
among
whom
especially
before
all
others
we
ought
to
give
a
singular
laud
unto
that
noble
and
great
philosopher
geoffrey
chaucer
then
caxton
goes
on
to
tell
us
how
hard
he
had
found
it
to
get
a
correct
copy
of
poems
for
i
find
many
of
the
said
books
which
writers
have
abridged
it
and
many
things
left
out
and
in
some
places
have
set
verses
that
he
never
made
nor
set
in
his
book
this
shows
us
how
quickly
stories
became
changed
in
the
days
when
everything
was
copied
by
hand
when
caxton
wrote
these
words
chaucer
had
not
been
dead
more
than
about
eighty
years
yet
already
it
was
not
easy
to
find
a
good
copy
of
his
works
and
if
stories
changed
the
language
changed
just
as
quickly
caxton
tells
us
that
the
language
was
changing
so
fast
that
he
found
it
hard
to
read
books
written
at
the
time
he
was
born
his
own
language
is
very
frenchy
perhaps
because
he
translated
so
many
of
his
books
from
french
he
not
only
uses
words
which
are
almost
french
but
arranges
his
sentences
in
a
french
manner
he
often
too
drops
the
e
in
the
just
as
in
french
the
e
or
a
in
le
and
la
is
dropped
before
a
vowel
this
you
will
often
find
in
old
english
books
the
abbey
becomes
thabbay
the
english
thenglish
caxton
writes
too
thensygnementys
for
the
teaching
here
we
have
the
dropped
e
and
also
the
french
word
enseignement
used
instead
of
teaching
but
these
were
only
last
struggles
of
a
foreign
tongue
the
triumphant
english
we
now
possess
was
already
taking
form
but
it
was
not
by
printing
alone
that
in
the
fifteenth
century
men
eyes
were
opened
to
new
wonder
they
were
also
opened
to
the
wonder
of
a
new
world
far
over
the
sea
for
the
fifteenth
century
was
the
age
of
discovery
and
of
all
the
world
first
great
sailors
it
was
the
time
when
america
and
the
western
isles
were
discovered
when
the
cape
of
good
hope
was
first
rounded
and
the
new
way
to
india
found
so
with
the
whole
world
urged
to
action
by
the
knowledge
of
these
new
lands
with
imagination
wakened
by
the
tales
of
marvels
to
be
seen
there
with
a
new
desire
to
see
and
do
stirring
in
men
minds
it
was
not
wonderful
that
there
should
be
little
new
writing
the
fifteenth
century
was
the
age
of
new
action
and
new
worlds
the
new
thought
was
to
follow
year
chapter
xxxii
about
the
beginning
of
the
theater
many
of
you
have
no
doubt
been
to
the
theater
you
have
seen
pantomimes
and
peter
pan
perhaps
perhaps
too
a
play
of
shakespeare
a
comedy
it
may
be
which
made
you
laugh
or
even
a
tragedy
which
made
you
want
to
cry
or
at
least
left
you
sad
some
of
you
too
have
been
to
pageants
and
some
may
even
have
been
to
an
oratorio
which
last
may
have
been
sung
in
a
church
but
did
you
ever
wonder
how
plays
and
theaters
came
to
be
did
you
ever
think
that
there
was
a
time
when
in
all
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
land
there
was
no
theater
when
there
were
no
plays
either
merry
or
sad
yet
it
was
so
but
at
a
very
early
time
the
people
of
england
began
to
act
and
strange
as
it
may
seem
to
us
now
the
earliest
plays
were
acted
by
monks
and
took
place
in
church
and
it
is
from
these
very
early
monkish
plays
that
the
theater
with
its
different
kinds
of
plays
that
pageants
and
even
oratorios
have
sprung
in
this
chapter
i
am
going
to
talk
about
these
beginnings
of
the
english
theater
and
of
its
literature
all
plays
taken
together
are
called
the
drama
and
the
writers
of
them
are
called
dramatists
from
a
greek
word
dran
to
act
or
do
for
dramas
are
written
not
to
be
read
merely
but
also
to
be
acted
to
trace
the
english
drama
from
its
beginnings
we
must
go
a
long
way
back
from
the
reigns
of
henry
vii
and
of
henry
viii
down
to
which
the
life
of
dunbar
has
brought
us
we
must
go
back
to
the
days
when
the
priests
were
the
only
learned
people
in
the
land
when
the
monasteries
were
the
only
schools
if
we
would
picture
to
ourselves
what
these
first
english
plays
were
like
we
must
not
think
of
a
brilliantly
lighted
theater
pranked
out
and
fine
with
red
and
gold
and
white
such
as
we
know
we
must
think
rather
of
some
dim
old
church
stately
pillars
rise
around
us
and
the
outline
of
the
arches
is
lost
in
the
high
twilight
of
the
roof
behind
the
quaintly
dressed
players
gleams
the
great
crucifix
with
its
strange
sad
figure
and
outstretched
arms
which
under
the
flickering
light
of
the
high
altar
candles
seems
to
stir
to
life
and
beyond
the
circle
of
light
in
the
soft
darkness
of
the
nave
the
silent
people
kneel
or
stand
to
watch
it
was
in
such
solemn
surroundings
that
our
first
plays
were
played
and
the
stories
that
were
acted
were
bible
stories
there
was
no
thought
of
irreverence
in
such
acting
on
the
contrary
these
plays
were
performed
to
exort
the
mindes
of
common
people
to
good
devotion
and
holesome
doctrine
you
remember
when
caedmon
sang
he
made
his
songs
of
the
stories
of
genesis
and
exodus
and
in
this
way
in
those
bookless
days
the
people
were
taught
the
bible
stories
but
you
know
that
what
we
learn
by
our
ears
is
much
harder
to
remember
than
what
we
learn
by
our
eyes
if
we
are
only
told
a
thing
we
may
easily
forget
it
but
if
we
have
seen
it
or
seen
a
picture
of
it
we
remember
it
much
more
easily
in
those
days
however
there
were
as
few
pictures
as
there
were
books
in
england
and
so
the
priests
and
monks
fell
upon
the
plan
of
acting
the
bible
stories
and
the
stories
of
the
saints
so
that
the
people
might
see
and
better
understand
these
plays
which
the
monks
made
were
called
mystery
or
miracle
plays
i
can
not
tell
you
the
exact
date
of
our
first
miracle
plays
but
the
earliest
that
we
know
of
certainly
was
acted
at
the
end
of
the
eleventh
or
beginning
of
the
twelfth
century
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
suppose
however
that
there
had
been
still
earlier
plays
of
which
we
know
nothing
for
the
miracle
plays
did
not
spring
all
at
once
to
life
they
began
gradually
and
the
beginnings
can
be
traced
as
far
back
as
the
ninth
century
in
an
old
book
of
rules
for
winchester
cathedral
written
about
there
are
directions
given
for
showing
the
death
and
resurrection
of
christ
in
dumb
show
chiefly
with
just
a
few
latin
sentences
to
explain
it
by
degrees
these
plays
grew
longer
and
fuller
until
in
them
the
whole
story
of
man
from
the
creation
to
the
day
of
judgment
was
acted
in
what
was
called
a
cycle
or
circle
of
short
acts
or
plays
but
although
these
plays
were
looked
upon
as
an
act
of
religion
they
were
not
all
solemn
at
times
above
the
grave
tones
of
the
monks
or
the
solemn
chanting
of
the
choir
laughter
rang
out
for
some
of
the
characters
were
meant
to
be
funny
and
the
watching
crowd
knew
and
greeted
them
as
such
even
before
they
spoke
just
as
we
know
and
greet
the
jester
or
the
clown
the
demons
were
generally
funny
and
noah
wife
who
argued
about
going
into
the
ark
the
shepherds
also
watching
their
flocks
by
night
were
almost
sure
to
make
the
people
laugh
but
there
were
solemn
moments
too
when
the
people
reverently
listened
to
the
grave
words
of
god
the
father
or
to
those
tender
and
loving
of
mary
the
virgin
mother
and
when
the
shepherds
neared
the
manger
where
lay
the
wondrous
babe
all
jesting
ceased
here
there
was
nothing
but
tender
if
simple
and
unlearned
adoration
in
those
early
days
latin
was
the
tongue
of
the
church
and
the
miracle
plays
were
at
first
said
in
latin
but
as
the
common
folk
could
not
understand
what
was
said
the
plays
were
chiefly
shown
in
dumb
show
soon
however
latin
was
given
up
and
the
plays
were
acted
in
english
then
by
degrees
the
churches
grew
too
small
to
hold
the
great
crowds
of
people
who
wished
to
see
the
plays
and
so
they
were
acted
outside
the
church
door
in
the
churchyard
on
a
stage
built
level
with
the
steps
the
church
then
could
be
made
to
represent
heaven
where
god
and
the
angels
dwelt
the
stage
itself
was
the
world
and
below
it
was
hell
from
out
of
which
came
smoke
and
sometimes
flames
and
whence
might
be
heard
groans
and
cries
and
the
clanking
of
chains
but
the
playing
of
mysteries
and
miracles
at
the
church
doors
had
soon
to
be
given
up
for
the
people
in
their
excitement
forgot
the
respect
due
to
the
dead
they
trampled
upon
the
graves
and
destroyed
the
tombs
in
their
eagerness
to
see
and
when
the
play
was
over
the
graveyard
was
a
sorry
sight
with
trodden
grass
and
broken
headstones
so
by
degrees
it
came
about
that
these
plays
lost
their
connection
with
the
churches
and
were
no
more
played
in
or
near
them
they
were
instead
played
in
some
open
space
about
the
town
such
as
the
then
too
the
players
ceased
to
be
monks
and
priests
and
the
acting
was
taken
up
by
the
people
themselves
it
was
then
that
the
playing
came
into
the
hands
of
the
trade
guilds
nowadays
we
hear
a
great
deal
about
trades
unions
but
in
those
days
such
things
were
unknown
each
trade
however
had
its
own
guild
by
which
the
members
of
it
were
bound
together
each
guild
had
its
patron
saint
and
after
a
time
the
members
of
a
guild
began
to
act
a
play
on
their
saint
day
in
his
honor
later
still
the
guilds
all
worked
together
and
all
acted
their
plays
on
one
day
this
was
corpus
christi
day
a
feast
founded
by
pope
urban
iv
in
as
this
feast
was
in
summer
it
was
a
very
good
time
to
act
the
plays
for
the
weather
was
warm
and
the
days
were
long
the
plays
often
began
very
early
in
the
morning
as
soon
as
it
was
light
and
lasted
all
day
the
miracles
were
now
acted
on
a
movable
stage
this
stage
was
called
a
pageant
and
the
play
which
was
acted
on
it
was
also
in
time
called
a
pageant
the
stage
was
made
in
two
stories
the
upper
part
was
open
all
round
and
upon
this
the
acting
took
place
the
under
part
was
curtained
all
round
and
here
the
actors
dressed
from
here
too
they
came
out
and
when
they
had
finished
their
parts
they
went
back
again
within
the
curtains
the
movable
stages
were
of
course
not
very
large
so
sometimes
more
than
one
was
needed
for
a
play
at
other
times
the
players
overflowed
as
it
were
into
the
audience
here
herod
rages
on
the
pageant
and
in
the
street
also
is
one
stage
direction
the
devils
too
often
ran
among
the
people
partly
to
amuse
them
and
partly
to
frighten
and
show
them
what
might
happen
if
they
remained
wicked
at
the
creation
animals
of
all
kinds
which
had
been
kept
chained
up
were
let
loose
suddenly
and
ran
among
the
people
while
pigeons
set
free
from
cages
flew
over
their
heads
indeed
everything
seems
to
have
been
done
to
make
the
people
feel
the
plays
as
real
as
possible
the
pageants
were
on
wheels
and
as
soon
as
a
play
was
over
at
the
first
appointed
place
the
stage
was
dragged
by
men
to
the
next
place
and
the
play
again
began
in
an
old
we
are
told
the
places
where
they
played
them
was
in
every
streete
they
begane
first
at
the
abay
gates
and
when
the
first
pagiante
was
played
it
was
wheeled
to
the
highe
crosse
befor
the
mayor
and
soe
to
every
streete
and
soe
every
streete
had
a
pagiant
playinge
before
them
at
one
time
till
all
the
pagiantes
for
the
daye
appoynted
weare
played
and
when
one
pagiante
was
neare
ended
worde
was
broughte
from
streete
to
streete
that
soe
they
mighte
come
in
place
thereof
exceedinge
orderly
and
all
the
streetes
have
theire
pagiantes
afore
them
all
at
one
time
playinge
togeather
thus
if
a
man
kept
his
place
all
a
long
summer
day
he
might
see
pass
before
him
pageant
after
pageant
until
he
had
seen
the
whole
story
of
the
world
from
the
creation
to
the
day
of
judgment
in
time
nearly
every
town
of
any
size
in
england
had
its
own
cycle
of
plays
but
only
four
of
these
have
come
down
to
us
these
are
the
york
the
chester
the
wakefield
and
the
coventry
cycles
perhaps
the
most
interesting
of
them
all
are
the
wakefield
plays
they
are
also
called
the
townley
plays
from
the
name
of
the
family
who
possessed
the
manuscript
for
a
long
time
year
after
year
the
same
guild
acted
the
same
play
and
it
really
seemed
as
if
the
pageant
was
in
many
cases
chosen
to
suit
the
trade
of
the
players
the
of
chester
for
instance
acted
the
flood
in
york
the
shipwrights
acted
the
building
of
the
ark
the
fishmongers
the
flood
and
the
beaters
and
the
three
kings
out
of
the
east
the
members
of
each
guild
tried
to
make
their
pageant
as
fine
as
they
could
indeed
they
were
expected
to
do
so
for
in
we
find
the
mayor
of
york
ordering
the
craftsmen
to
bring
forth
their
pageants
in
order
and
course
by
good
players
well
arrayed
and
openly
speaking
upon
pain
of
losing
of
shillings
to
be
paid
to
the
chamber
without
any
pardon
sharp
dissertation
on
the
pageants
so
in
order
to
supply
everything
that
was
needful
each
member
of
a
guild
paid
what
was
called
pageant
silver
accounts
of
how
this
money
was
spent
were
carefully
kept
a
few
of
these
have
come
down
to
us
and
some
of
the
items
and
prices
paid
sound
very
funny
now
paid
for
setting
the
world
of
fire
for
making
and
mending
of
the
black
souls
hose
for
a
pair
of
new
hose
and
mending
of
the
old
for
the
white
souls
paid
for
mending
pilate
hat
the
actors
too
were
paid
here
are
some
of
the
prices
to
fawson
for
hanging
judas
paid
to
fawson
for
cock
crowing
some
got
much
more
than
others
pilate
for
instance
who
was
an
important
character
got
while
two
angels
only
got
between
them
but
while
the
rehearsing
and
acting
were
going
on
the
players
received
their
food
and
when
it
was
all
over
they
wound
up
with
a
great
supper
chapter
xxxiii
how
the
shepherds
watched
their
flocks
in
this
chapter
i
am
going
to
give
you
a
part
of
one
of
the
townley
plays
to
show
you
what
the
beginnings
of
our
drama
were
like
although
our
forefathers
tried
to
make
the
pageants
as
real
as
possible
they
had
of
course
no
scenery
but
acted
on
a
little
bare
platform
they
never
thought
either
that
the
stories
they
acted
had
taken
place
long
ago
and
in
lands
far
away
where
dress
and
manners
and
even
climate
were
all
very
different
from
what
they
were
in
england
for
instance
in
the
shepherd
play
of
which
i
am
going
to
tell
the
first
shepherd
comes
in
shivering
with
cold
for
though
he
is
acting
in
summer
he
must
make
believe
that
it
is
for
on
christmas
day
christ
was
born
and
in
england
he
knows
is
cold
what
it
may
be
in
palestine
he
neither
knows
nor
cares
lord
what
these
weathers
are
cold
and
i
am
ill
happed
i
am
near
hand
dulled
so
long
have
i
napped
my
legs
they
fold
my
fingers
are
chapped
it
is
not
as
i
would
for
i
am
all
lapped
in
sorrow
in
storm
and
tempest
now
in
the
east
now
in
the
west
woe
is
him
has
never
rest
or
morrow
in
this
strain
the
shepherd
grumbles
until
the
second
comes
he
too
complains
of
the
cold
the
frost
so
hideous
they
water
mine
een
no
lie
now
is
dry
now
is
wet
now
is
snow
now
is
sleet
when
my
shoon
freeze
to
my
feet
it
is
not
all
easy
so
they
talk
until
the
third
shepherd
comes
he
too
grumbles
was
never
syne
noah
floods
such
floods
seen
winds
and
rains
so
rude
and
storms
so
keen
the
first
two
ask
the
third
shepherd
where
the
sheep
are
sir
he
replies
this
same
day
at
morn
i
left
them
i
the
corn
when
they
rang
lauds
they
had
pasture
good
they
can
not
go
wrong
that
is
all
right
say
the
others
and
so
they
settle
to
sing
a
song
when
a
neighbor
named
mak
comes
along
they
greet
the
newcomer
with
jests
but
the
second
shepherd
is
suspicious
of
him
thus
late
as
thou
goes
what
will
men
suppose
and
thou
hast
no
ill
nose
for
stealing
of
sheep
i
am
true
as
steel
says
mak
all
men
wot
it
but
a
sickness
i
feel
that
holds
me
full
hot
and
so
he
says
he
is
obliged
to
walk
about
at
night
for
coolness
the
shepherds
are
all
very
weary
and
want
to
sleep
but
just
to
make
things
quite
safe
they
bid
mak
lie
down
between
them
so
that
he
can
not
move
without
awaking
them
mak
lies
down
as
he
is
bid
but
he
does
not
sleep
and
as
soon
as
the
others
are
all
snoring
he
softly
rises
and
borrows
a
sheep
quickly
he
goes
home
with
it
and
knocks
at
his
cottage
door
how
gill
art
thou
in
get
us
a
light
who
makes
such
din
this
time
of
night
answers
his
wife
from
within
when
she
hears
that
it
is
mak
she
unbars
the
door
but
when
she
sees
what
her
husband
brings
she
is
afraid
by
the
naked
neck
thou
art
like
to
hang
she
says
i
have
often
escaped
before
replies
mak
but
so
long
goes
the
pot
to
the
water
men
say
at
last
comes
it
home
broken
cries
gill
but
the
question
is
now
that
they
have
the
sheep
how
is
it
to
be
his
from
the
shepherds
for
mak
feels
sure
that
they
will
suspect
him
when
they
find
out
that
a
sheep
is
missing
gill
has
a
plan
she
will
swaddle
the
sheep
like
a
baby
and
lay
it
in
the
cradle
this
being
done
mak
returns
to
the
shepherds
whom
he
finds
still
sleeping
and
lies
down
again
beside
them
presently
they
all
awake
and
rouse
mak
who
still
pretends
to
sleep
he
after
some
talk
goes
home
and
the
shepherds
go
off
to
seek
and
count
their
sheep
agreeing
to
meet
again
at
the
crooked
thorn
soon
the
shepherds
find
that
one
sheep
is
missing
and
suspecting
mak
of
having
stolen
it
they
follow
him
home
they
find
him
sitting
by
the
cradle
singing
a
lullaby
to
the
baby
while
gill
lies
in
bed
groaning
and
pretending
to
be
very
mak
greets
the
shepherds
in
a
friendly
way
but
bids
them
speak
softly
and
not
walk
about
as
his
wife
is
ill
and
the
baby
asleep
but
the
shepherds
will
not
be
put
off
with
words
they
search
the
house
but
can
find
nothing
all
work
we
in
vain
as
well
may
we
go
bother
it
i
can
find
no
flesh
hard
or
nesh
salt
or
fresh
but
two
platters
meanwhile
gill
from
her
bed
cries
out
at
them
calling
them
thieves
ye
come
to
rob
us
i
swear
if
ever
i
you
beguiled
that
i
eat
this
child
that
lies
in
this
cradle
the
shepherds
at
length
begin
to
be
sorry
that
they
have
been
so
unjust
as
to
suspect
mak
they
wish
to
make
friends
again
but
mak
will
not
be
friends
farewell
all
three
and
glad
i
am
to
see
you
go
he
cries
so
the
shepherds
go
a
little
sadly
fair
winds
may
there
be
but
love
there
is
none
this
year
says
one
gave
ye
the
child
anything
says
another
i
trow
not
a
farthing
then
back
will
i
go
says
the
third
shepherd
abide
ye
there
and
back
he
goes
full
of
his
kindly
thought
mak
he
says
with
your
leave
let
me
give
your
bairn
but
sixpence
but
mak
still
pretends
to
be
sulky
and
will
not
let
him
come
near
the
child
by
this
time
all
the
shepherds
have
come
back
one
wants
to
kiss
the
baby
and
bends
over
the
cradle
suddenly
he
starts
back
what
a
nose
the
deceit
is
found
out
and
the
shepherds
are
very
angry
yet
even
in
their
anger
they
can
hardly
help
laughing
mak
and
gill
however
are
ready
of
wit
they
will
not
own
to
the
theft
it
is
a
changeling
child
they
say
he
was
taken
with
an
elf
i
saw
it
myself
when
the
clock
struck
twelve
was
he
foreshapen
says
gill
but
the
shepherds
will
not
be
deceived
a
second
time
they
resolve
to
punish
mak
but
let
him
off
after
having
tossed
him
in
a
blanket
until
they
are
tired
and
he
is
sore
and
sorry
for
himself
this
sheepstealing
scene
shows
how
those
who
wrote
the
play
tried
to
catch
the
interest
of
the
people
for
every
one
who
saw
this
scene
could
understand
it
sheepstealing
was
a
very
common
crime
in
england
in
those
days
and
was
often
punished
by
death
probably
every
one
who
saw
the
play
knew
of
such
cases
and
the
writers
used
this
scene
as
a
link
between
the
everyday
life
which
was
near
at
hand
and
easy
to
understand
and
the
story
of
the
birth
of
christ
which
was
so
far
off
and
hard
to
understand
and
it
is
now
when
the
shepherds
are
resting
from
their
hard
work
of
beating
mak
that
they
hear
the
angels
sing
glory
to
god
in
the
highest
from
this
point
on
all
the
jesting
ceases
and
in
its
rough
way
the
play
is
reverent
and
loving
the
angel
speaks
rise
herdmen
quickly
for
now
is
he
born
that
shall
take
from
the
fiend
what
adam
was
lorn
that
demon
to
spoil
this
night
is
he
born
god
is
made
your
friend
now
at
this
morn
he
behests
at
bethlehem
go
see
there
lies
that
in
a
crib
full
poorly
betwixt
two
beasties
the
shepherds
hear
the
words
of
the
angel
and
looking
upward
see
the
guiding
star
wondering
at
the
music
talking
of
the
prophecies
of
david
and
isaiah
they
hasten
to
bethlehem
and
find
the
lowly
stable
here
with
a
mixture
of
awe
and
tenderness
the
shepherds
greet
the
holy
child
it
is
half
as
if
they
spoke
to
the
god
they
feared
half
as
if
they
played
with
some
little
helpless
baby
who
was
their
very
own
they
mingle
simple
things
of
everyday
life
with
their
awe
they
give
him
gifts
but
their
simple
minds
can
imagine
no
other
than
those
they
might
give
to
their
own
children
the
first
shepherd
greets
the
child
with
words
hail
comely
and
clean
hail
young
child
hail
maker
as
methinks
of
a
maiden
so
mild
thou
hast
warred
i
ween
the
demon
so
wild
then
he
gives
as
his
gift
a
bob
of
cherries
the
second
shepherd
speaks
hail
sovereign
saviour
for
thee
have
we
sought
hail
noble
child
and
flower
that
all
thing
hast
wrought
hail
full
of
favour
that
made
all
of
nought
hail
i
kneel
and
i
cower
a
bird
have
i
brought
to
my
bairn
hail
little
tiny
mop
of
our
creed
thou
art
crop
i
would
drink
to
thy
health
little
day
star
the
third
shepherd
speaks
hail
darling
dear
full
of
godhead
i
pray
thee
be
near
when
that
i
have
need
hail
sweet
is
thy
cheer
my
heart
would
bleed
to
see
thee
sit
here
in
so
poor
weed
with
no
pennies
hail
put
forth
thy
dall
i
bring
thee
but
a
ball
have
and
play
thee
with
all
and
go
to
the
tennis
and
so
the
pageant
of
the
shepherds
comes
to
an
end
and
they
return
home
rejoicing
this
play
gives
us
a
good
idea
of
how
the
miracles
wound
themselves
about
the
lives
of
the
people
it
gives
us
a
good
idea
of
the
rudeness
of
the
times
when
such
jesting
with
what
we
hold
as
sacred
seemed
not
amiss
it
gives
too
the
first
gleam
of
what
we
might
call
true
comedy
in
english
chapter
xxxiv
the
story
of
everyman
a
little
later
than
the
miracle
and
mystery
plays
came
another
sort
of
play
called
the
moralities
in
these
instead
or
representing
real
people
the
actors
represented
thoughts
feelings
and
deeds
good
and
bad
truth
for
instance
would
be
shown
as
a
beautiful
lady
lying
as
an
ugly
old
man
and
so
on
these
plays
were
meant
to
teach
just
as
the
miracles
were
meant
to
teach
but
instead
of
teaching
the
bible
stories
they
were
made
to
show
men
the
ugliness
of
sin
and
the
beauty
of
goodness
when
we
go
to
the
theater
now
we
only
think
of
being
amused
and
it
is
strange
to
remember
that
all
acting
was
at
first
meant
to
teach
the
very
first
of
our
moralities
seems
to
have
been
a
play
of
the
lord
prayer
it
was
acted
in
the
reign
of
edward
iii
or
some
time
after
but
that
has
long
been
lost
and
we
know
nothing
of
it
but
its
name
there
are
several
other
moralities
however
which
have
come
down
to
us
of
a
later
date
the
earliest
being
of
the
fifteenth
century
and
of
them
perhaps
the
most
interesting
is
everyman
but
we
can
not
claim
everyman
altogether
as
english
literature
for
it
is
translated
from
or
at
least
founded
upon
a
dutch
play
yet
it
is
the
best
of
all
the
moralities
which
have
come
down
to
us
and
may
have
been
translated
into
english
about
in
its
own
time
it
must
have
been
thought
well
of
or
no
one
would
have
troubled
to
translate
it
but
however
popular
it
was
long
ago
for
hundreds
of
years
it
had
lain
almost
forgotten
unread
except
by
a
very
few
and
never
acted
at
all
until
some
one
drew
it
from
its
dark
and
once
more
put
it
upon
the
stage
since
then
during
the
last
few
years
it
has
been
acted
often
and
as
happily
the
actors
have
tried
to
perform
it
in
the
simple
fashion
in
which
it
must
have
been
done
long
ago
we
can
get
from
it
a
very
good
idea
of
the
plays
which
pleased
our
forefathers
on
the
of
everyman
we
read
here
beginneth
a
treatise
how
the
high
father
of
heaven
sendeth
death
to
summon
every
creature
to
come
to
give
a
count
of
their
lives
in
this
world
and
is
in
the
manner
of
a
moral
play
so
in
the
play
we
learn
how
death
comes
to
everyman
and
bids
him
follow
him
but
everyman
is
gay
and
young
he
loves
life
he
has
many
friends
the
world
to
him
is
beautiful
he
can
not
leave
it
so
he
prays
death
to
let
him
stay
offers
him
gold
and
riches
if
he
will
but
put
off
the
matter
until
another
day
but
death
is
stern
thee
availeth
not
to
cry
weep
and
pray
he
says
but
haste
thee
lightly
that
thou
wert
gone
the
journey
then
seeing
that
go
he
must
everyman
thinks
that
at
least
he
will
have
company
on
the
journey
so
he
turns
to
his
friends
but
alas
none
will
go
with
him
one
by
one
they
leave
him
then
everyman
cries
in
despair
o
to
whom
shall
i
make
my
moan
for
to
go
with
me
in
that
heavy
journey
first
fellowship
said
he
would
with
me
gone
his
words
were
very
pleasant
and
gay
but
afterward
he
left
me
alone
then
spake
i
to
my
kinsmen
all
in
despair
and
also
they
gave
me
words
fair
they
lacked
no
fair
speaking
but
all
forsake
me
in
the
ending
so
at
last
everyman
turns
him
to
his
good
deeds
his
good
deeds
whom
he
had
almost
forgotten
and
who
lies
bound
and
in
prison
by
reason
of
his
sins
and
good
deeds
consents
to
go
with
him
on
the
dread
journey
with
him
come
others
too
among
them
knowledge
and
strength
but
at
the
last
these
too
turn
back
only
good
deeds
is
true
only
good
deeds
stands
by
him
to
the
end
with
comforting
words
and
so
the
play
ends
the
body
of
everyman
is
laid
in
the
grave
but
we
know
that
his
soul
goes
home
to
god
this
play
is
meant
to
picture
the
life
of
every
man
or
woman
and
to
show
how
unhappy
we
may
be
in
the
end
if
we
have
not
tried
to
be
good
in
this
world
this
moral
men
may
have
in
mind
the
hearers
take
it
of
worth
old
and
young
and
forsake
pride
for
he
deceiveth
you
in
the
end
and
remember
beauty
five
wits
strength
and
discretion
they
all
at
the
last
do
everyman
forsake
save
his
good
deeds
these
doth
he
take
and
beware
an
they
be
small
before
god
he
hath
no
help
at
all
none
excuse
may
be
there
for
everyman
books
to
read
everyman
a
morality
everyman

chapter

how
a
poet
comforted
a
girl
perhaps
the
best
morality
of
which
we
know
the
author
name
is
magnificence
by
john
skelton
but
especially
after
everyman
it
is
dull
reading
for
little
people
and
it
is
not
in
order
to
speak
of
this
play
that
i
write
about
skelton
john
skelton
lived
in
the
stormy
times
of
henry
viii
and
he
is
called
sometimes
our
first
but
he
was
not
laureate
as
we
now
understand
it
he
was
not
the
king
poet
the
title
only
meant
that
he
had
taken
a
degree
in
grammar
and
latin
verse
and
had
been
given
a
laurel
wreath
by
the
university
which
gave
the
degree
it
was
in
this
way
that
skelton
was
made
laureate
first
by
oxford
then
by
louvain
in
belgium
and
thirdly
by
cambridge
so
that
in
his
day
he
was
considered
a
learned
man
and
a
great
poet
he
was
a
friend
of
caxton
and
helped
him
with
one
of
his
books
i
pray
maister
skelton
late
created
in
the
university
of
oxenford
says
caxton
to
oversee
and
correct
this
said
book
john
skelton
like
so
many
other
literary
men
of
those
days
was
a
priest
he
studied
perhaps
both
at
oxford
and
at
cambridge
and
became
tutor
to
prince
afterwards
king
henry
viii
we
do
not
know
if
he
had
an
easy
time
with
his
royal
pupil
or
not
but
in
one
of
his
poems
he
tells
us
that
the
honour
of
england
i
learned
to
spell
and
acquainted
him
with
the
muses
nine
the
days
of
henry
viii
were
troublous
times
for
thinking
people
the
king
was
a
tyrant
and
the
people
of
england
were
finding
it
harder
than
ever
to
bow
to
a
tyrant
while
the
world
was
awakening
to
new
thought
and
new
desires
for
freedom
both
in
religion
and
in
life
the
reformation
had
begun
the
teaching
of
piers
ploughman
the
preaching
of
wyclif
had
long
since
almost
been
forgotten
but
it
had
never
altogether
died
out
the
evils
in
the
church
and
in
high
places
were
as
bad
as
ever
and
skelton
himself
a
priest
preached
against
them
he
attacked
other
even
though
he
himself
sinned
against
the
laws
of
priesthood
for
he
was
married
and
in
those
days
marriage
was
forbidden
to
clergymen
and
his
life
was
not
so
fair
as
it
might
have
been
at
first
wolsey
the
great
cardinal
and
friend
of
henry
viii
was
skelton
friend
too
but
skelton
tongue
was
mocking
and
bitter
he
was
a
sharp
satirist
but
with
more
railing
and
scoffery
than
became
a
said
one
the
cardinal
became
an
enemy
and
the
railing
tongue
was
turned
against
him
in
a
poem
called
colin
cloute
skelton
pointed
out
the
evils
of
his
day
and
at
the
same
time
pointed
the
finger
of
scorn
at
wolsey
colin
cloute
like
piers
ploughman
was
meant
to
mean
the
simple
good
englishman
puttenham
thus
i
colin
cloute
as
i
go
about
and
wandering
as
i
walk
there
the
people
talk
men
say
for
silver
and
gold
mitres
are
bought
and
sold
and
again
laymen
say
indeed
how
they
the
priests
take
no
heed
their
silly
sheep
to
feed
but
pluck
away
and
pull
the
fleeces
of
their
wool
but
he
adds
of
no
good
bishop
speak
i
nor
good
priest
i
decry
good
friar
nor
good
chanon
good
nun
nor
good
canon
good
monk
nor
good
clerk
nor
yet
no
good
work
but
my
recounting
is
of
them
that
do
amiss
as
canon
yet
although
skelton
said
he
would
not
decry
any
good
man
or
any
good
work
his
spirit
was
a
mocking
one
he
was
fond
of
harsh
jests
and
rude
laughter
and
no
person
or
thing
was
too
high
or
too
holy
to
escape
his
sharp
wit
he
was
doubtless
a
pleasant
conceited
fellow
and
of
a
very
sharp
wit
says
a
writer
about
sixty
years
later
exceeding
bold
and
would
nip
to
the
very
quick
when
he
once
set
hold
webbe
and
being
bold
as
bitter
and
having
set
hold
with
hatred
upon
wolsey
he
in
another
poem
called
why
come
ye
not
to
court
and
in
still
another
called
speake
parrot
wrote
directly
against
the
cardinal
yet
although
skelton
railed
against
the
cardinal
and
against
the
evils
in
the
church
he
was
no
protestant
he
believed
in
the
church
of
rome
and
would
have
been
sorry
to
think
that
he
had
helped
the
heretics
wolsey
was
still
powerful
and
he
made
up
his
mind
to
silence
his
enemy
so
skelton
found
himself
more
than
once
in
prison
and
at
last
to
escape
the
cardinal
anger
he
was
forced
to
take
sanctuary
in
westminster
there
he
remained
until
he
died
a
few
months
before
his
great
enemy
fell
from
power
as
many
of
skelton
poems
were
thus
about
quarrels
over
religion
and
politics
much
of
the
interest
in
them
has
died
yet
as
he
himself
says
for
although
my
rhyme
is
ragged
tattered
and
jagged
rudely
rust
and
moth
eaten
if
ye
take
well
therewith
it
hath
in
it
some
pith
and
it
is
well
to
remember
the
name
of
colin
cloute
at
least
because
a
later
and
much
greater
poet
borrowed
that
name
for
one
of
his
own
poems
as
you
shall
hear
but
the
poem
which
keeps
most
interest
for
us
is
one
which
perhaps
at
the
time
it
was
written
was
thought
least
important
it
is
called
the
book
of
philip
sparrow
and
this
poem
shows
us
that
skelton
was
not
always
bitter
and
biting
for
it
is
neither
bitter
nor
coarse
but
is
a
dainty
and
tender
lament
written
for
a
schoolgirl
whose
sparrow
had
been
killed
by
a
cat
it
is
written
in
the
same
short
lines
as
colin
cloute
and
others
of
skelton
poems
breathless
rhymes
they
have
been
called
these
short
lines
remind
us
somewhat
of
the
old
short
except
that
they
rime
they
are
called
after
their
author
skeltonical
hall
what
chiefly
makes
the
book
of
philip
sparrow
interesting
is
that
it
is
the
original
of
our
nursery
rime
who
killed
cock
robin
it
is
written
in
the
form
of
a
dirge
and
many
people
were
shocked
at
that
for
they
said
that
it
was
but
another
form
of
mockery
that
this
jesting
priest
had
chosen
with
which
to
divert
himself
but
i
think
that
little
jane
scoupe
at
school
in
the
nunnery
at
carowe
would
dry
her
eyes
and
smile
when
she
read
it
she
must
have
been
pleased
that
the
famous
poet
who
had
been
the
tutor
and
friend
and
who
had
been
both
the
friend
and
enemy
of
the
great
cardinal
should
trouble
to
write
such
a
long
poem
all
about
her
sparrow
here
are
a
few
quotations
from
it
pla
ce
bo
who
is

who
di
le

that

the

of
the
first
chant
in
the
service
for
the
dead
skelton
has
here
made
it
into
three
words
the
chant
is
called
the
placebo
from
the
first
word
i
wept
and
i
wailed
the
tears

but
nothing
it
availed
to
call

again
that
gib

gib
i
say
our
cat
worried
her
on
that
which
i
loved
best
it
can
not
be
expressed
my
sorrowful
heaviness
and
all
without
redress
it
had
a
velvet
cap
and
would
sit
upon
my
lap
and
seek
after
small
worms
and
sometimes
white
sometimes
he
would
gasp
when
he
saw
a
wasp
a
fly
or
a
gnat
he
would
fly
at
that
and
prettily
he
would
pant
when
he
saw
an
ant
lord
how
he
would
fly
after
the
butterfly
and
when
i
said
phip
phip
then
he
would
leap
and
skip
and
take
me
by
the
lip
alas
it
will
me
slo
that
philip
is
gone
me
fro
for
it
would
come
and
go
and
fly
so
to
and
fro
and
on
me
it
would
leap
when
i
was
asleep
and
his
feathers
shake
wherewith
he
would
make
me
often
for
to
wake
that
vengeance
i
ask
and
cry
by
way
of
exclamation
on
all
the
whole
nation
of
cats
wild
and
tame
god
send
them
sorrow

shame
that
cat
especially
that
slew
so
cruelly
my

the

the
renaissance
renaissance
means
rebirth
and
to
make
you
understand
something
of
what
the
word
means
in
our
literature
i
must
take
you
a
long
way
you
have
been
told
that
the
fifteenth
century
was
a
dull
time
in
english
literature
but
that
it
was
also
a
time
of
new
action
and
new
life
for
the
discovery
of
new
worlds
and
the
discovery
of
printing
had
opened
men
eyes
and
minds
to
new
wonders
there
was
a
third
event
which
added
to
this
new
life
by
bringing
new
thought
and
new
learning
to
england
that
was
the
taking
of
constantinople
by
the
turks
it
seems
difficult
to
understand
how
the
taking
of
constantinople
could
have
any
effect
on
our
literature
i
will
try
to
explain
but
in
order
to
do
so
clearly
i
must
go
back
to
the
time
of
the
romans
all
of
you
have
read
english
history
and
there
you
read
of
the
romans
you
know
what
a
clever
and
conquering
people
they
were
and
how
they
subdued
all
the
wild
tribes
who
lived
in
the
countries
around
them
besides
conquering
all
the
barbarians
around
them
the
romans
conquered
another
people
who
were
not
barbarians
but
who
were
in
some
ways
more
civilized
than
themselves
these
were
the
greeks
they
had
a
great
literature
they
were
more
learned
and
quite
as
skilled
in
the
arts
of
peace
as
the
romans
yet
in
long
before
the
romans
came
to
our
little
island
greece
became
a
roman
province
nearly
five
hundred
years
later
there
sat
upon
the
throne
an
emperor
named
constantine
and
he
although
rome
was
still
pagan
became
a
christian
he
was
besides
a
great
and
powerful
ruler
his
court
was
brilliant
glittering
with
all
the
golden
splendor
of
those
times
but
although
rome
was
still
pagan
greece
a
roman
province
had
become
christian
and
in
this
christian
province
constantine
made
up
his
mind
to
build
a
new
rome
in
those
days
the
boundaries
of
greece
stretched
far
further
than
they
do
now
and
it
was
upon
the
shores
of
the
bosphorus
that
constantine
built
his
new
capital
there
was
already
an
ancient
town
there
named
byzantium
but
he
transformed
it
into
a
new
and
splendid
city
the
emperor
willed
it
to
be
called
new
rome
but
instead
the
people
called
it
the
city
of
constantine
and
we
know
it
now
as
constantinople
when
constantinople
was
founded
it
was
a
roman
city
all
the
rulers
were
roman
all
the
high
posts
were
filled
by
romans
and
latin
was
the
speech
of
the
people
but
in
constantinople
it
happened
as
it
had
happened
in
england
after
the
conquest
in
england
for
a
time
after
the
conquest
the
rulers
were
french
and
the
language
was
french
but
gradually
all
that
passed
away
and
the
language
and
the
rulers
became
english
once
more
so
it
was
in
constantinople
by
degrees
it
became
a
greek
city
the
rulers
became
greek
and
greek
was
the
language
spoken
in
building
a
second
capital
constantine
had
weakened
his
empire
soon
it
was
split
in
two
and
there
arose
a
western
and
an
eastern
empire
as
time
went
on
the
western
empire
with
rome
at
its
head
declined
and
fell
while
the
eastern
empire
with
constantinople
as
its
capital
grew
great
but
it
grew
into
a
greek
empire
even
very
clever
people
can
not
tell
the
exact
date
at
which
the
roman
empire
came
to
an
end
and
the
greek
or
byzantine
empire
as
it
is
called
began
so
we
need
not
trouble
about
that
all
that
is
needful
for
us
to
understand
now
it
that
constantinople
was
a
christian
city
a
greek
city
and
a
of
greek
learning
and
literature
thus
constantinople
was
the
christian
outpost
of
europe
for
hundred
of
year
the
byzantine
empire
stood
as
a
barrier
against
the
saracen
hosts
of
asia
it
might
have
stood
still
longer
but
sad
to
say
this
barrier
was
first
broken
down
by
the
christians
themselves
for
in
the
armies
of
the
fourth
crusade
which
had
gathered
to
fight
the
heathen
turned
their
swords
to
their
shame
be
it
said
against
the
christian
people
of
the
greek
empire
constantinople
was
taken
plundered
and
destroyed
by
these
pious
brigands
and
the
last
of
the
byzantine
emperors
was
first
blinded
and
then
flung
from
a
high
tower
so
that
his
body
fell
shattered
to
pieces
on
the
of
his
own
capital
finlay
history
of
greece
baldwin
count
of
flanders
one
of
the
great
leaders
of
the
crusade
was
then
crowned
by
his
followers
and
acknowledged
emperor
of
the
east
but
the
once
great
empire
was
now
broken
up
and
out
of
it
three
lesser
empires
as
well
as
many
smaller
states
were
formed
baldwin
did
not
long
rule
as
emperor
of
the
east
and
the
greeks
after
a
time
succeeded
in
regaining
constantinople
from
the
western
christians
but
although
for
nearly
two
hundred
years
longer
they
kept
it
the
empire
was
dying
and
lifeless
and
by
degrees
as
the
power
of
greece
grew
less
the
power
of
turkey
grew
greater
at
length
in
the
sultan
mohammed
ii
attacked
constantinople
then
the
cross
which
for
a
thousand
years
and
more
had
stood
upon
the
ramparts
of
christendom
went
down
before
the
crescent
constantine
xi
the
last
of
the
greek
emperors
knelt
in
the
great
church
of
sophia
to
receive
for
the
last
time
the
holy
sacrament
then
mounting
his
horse
he
rode
forth
to
battle
fighting
for
his
kingdom
and
his
faith
he
fell
and
over
his
dead
body
the
young
sultan
and
his
soldiers
rode
into
the
ruined
city
then
in
the
church
where
but
a
few
hours
before
the
fallen
emperor
had
knelt
and
prayed
to
christ
the
sultan
bowed
himself
in
thanks
and
praise
to
allah
and
mohammed
and
now
we
come
to
the
point
where
the
taking
of
constantinople
and
the
fall
of
the
greek
empire
touches
our
literature
in
constantinople
the
ancient
learning
and
literature
of
the
greeks
had
lived
on
year
after
year
the
city
was
full
of
scholars
who
knew
and
loved
and
studied
the
greek
authors
but
now
before
the
terror
of
the
turk
driven
forth
by
the
fear
of
slavery
and
disgrace
these
greek
scholars
fled
they
fled
to
italy
and
although
in
their
flight
they
had
to
leave
goods
and
wealth
behind
the
came
laden
with
precious
manuscripts
from
the
libraries
of
constantinople
these
fugitive
greeks
brought
to
the
italians
a
learning
which
was
to
them
new
and
strange
soon
all
over
europe
the
news
of
the
new
learning
spread
then
across
the
alps
scholars
thronged
from
every
country
in
europe
to
listen
and
to
learn
i
do
not
think
i
can
quite
make
you
understand
what
this
new
learning
was
it
was
indeed
but
the
old
learning
of
greece
yet
there
was
in
it
something
that
can
never
grow
old
for
it
was
human
it
made
men
turn
away
from
idle
dreaming
and
begin
to
learn
that
the
world
we
live
in
is
real
they
began
to
realize
that
there
was
something
more
than
a
past
and
a
future
there
was
the
present
so
instead
of
giving
all
their
time
to
vague
wonderings
of
what
might
be
of
what
never
had
been
and
what
never
could
be
they
began
to
take
an
interest
in
life
as
it
was
and
in
man
as
he
was
they
began
to
see
that
human
life
with
all
its
joys
and
sorrows
was
after
all
the
most
interesting
thing
to
man
it
was
a
new
birth
and
men
called
it
so
for
that
is
the
meaning
of
renaissance
many
things
besides
the
fall
of
constantinople
helped
towards
this
new
birth
the
discovery
of
new
worlds
by
daring
sailors
like
columbus
and
cabot
and
the
discovery
of
printing
were
among
them
but
the
touchstone
of
the
new
learning
was
the
knowledge
of
greek
which
had
been
to
the
greater
part
of
europe
a
lost
tongue
on
this
side
of
the
alps
there
was
not
a
school
or
college
in
which
it
could
be
learned
so
to
italy
where
the
greek
scholars
had
found
a
refuge
those
who
wished
to
learn
flocked
among
them
were
some
oxford
scholars
chief
of
these
were
three
whose
names
you
will
learn
to
know
well
when
you
come
to
read
more
about
this
time
they
were
william
grocyn
the
most
upright
and
best
of
all
britons
thomas
linacre
and
john
colet
these
men
returning
from
italy
full
of
the
new
learning
began
to
teach
greek
at
oxford
and
it
is
strange
now
to
think
that
there
were
many
then
who
were
bitterly
against
such
teaching
the
students
even
formed
themselves
into
two
parties
for
and
against
they
were
called
greeks
and
trojans
and
between
these
two
parties
man
a
fierce
fight
took
place
for
the
quarrel
did
not
end
in
words
but
often
in
blows
the
new
learning
however
conquered
and
so
keenly
did
men
feel
the
human
interests
of
such
things
as
were
now
taught
that
we
have
come
to
call
grammar
rhetoric
poetry
greek
and
latin
the
humanities
and
the
professor
who
teaches
these
thing
the
professor
of
humanity
chapter
xxxvii
the
land
of
nowhere
while
the
new
learning
was
stirring
england
and
greek
was
being
for
the
first
time
taught
in
oxford
a
young
student
of
fourteen
came
to
the
university
there
this
student
was
named
thomas
more
he
was
the
son
of
a
lawyer
who
became
a
judge
and
as
a
little
boy
he
had
been
a
page
in
the
household
of
morton
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
the
archbishop
was
quick
to
see
that
the
boy
was
clever
this
child
here
waiting
at
the
table
whoever
will
live
to
see
it
will
prove
a
marvellous
man
he
would
say
and
so
he
persuaded
more
father
to
send
the
boy
to
oxford
to
study
law
roper
the
mirrour
of
virtue
thomas
remained
only
two
years
at
oxford
for
old
sir
john
fearing
he
was
learning
too
much
greek
and
literature
and
not
enough
law
called
his
son
home
and
sent
him
to
study
law
in
london
it
must
have
been
a
disappointment
to
the
boy
to
be
taken
from
the
clever
friends
he
had
made
in
oxford
and
from
the
books
and
studies
that
he
loved
to
be
set
instead
to
read
dry
but
thomas
more
was
most
nothing
made
him
sulky
or
cross
so
now
he
settled
down
quietly
to
his
new
life
and
in
a
very
short
time
became
a
famous
and
learned
lawyer
in
was
after
more
left
oxford
that
he
met
the
man
who
became
his
dearest
friend
this
was
desiderius
erasmus
a
learned
dutchman
he
was
eleven
years
older
than
more
and
he
could
speak
no
english
but
that
did
not
prevent
them
becoming
friends
as
they
both
could
speak
latin
easily
and
well
they
had
much
in
common
erasmus
was
of
the
same
lively
merry
wit
as
more
they
both
loved
literature
and
the
greek
learning
and
so
the
two
became
fast
friends
and
it
helps
us
to
understand
the
power
which
latin
still
held
over
our
literature
and
indeed
over
all
the
literature
of
europe
when
we
remember
that
these
two
friends
spoke
to
each
other
and
wrote
and
jested
in
latin
as
easily
as
they
might
have
done
in
english
erasmus
was
one
of
the
most
famous
men
of
his
time
he
was
one
who
did
much
in
his
day
to
free
men
minds
one
who
helped
men
to
think
for
themselves
so
although
he
had
directly
perhaps
little
to
do
with
english
literature
it
is
well
to
remember
him
as
the
friend
of
more
my
affection
for
the
man
is
so
great
wrote
erasmus
once
that
if
he
bade
me
dance
a
hornpipe
i
should
do
at
once
what
he
bid
me
although
more
was
so
merry
and
witty
religion
got
a
strong
hold
upon
him
and
at
one
time
he
thought
of
becoming
a
monk
but
his
friends
persuaded
him
to
give
up
that
idea
and
after
a
time
he
decided
to
marry
he
chose
his
wife
in
a
somewhat
quaint
manner
among
his
friends
there
was
a
gentleman
who
had
three
daughters
more
liked
the
second
one
best
for
that
he
thought
her
the
fairest
and
best
favoured
but
he
married
the
eldest
because
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
would
be
both
great
grief
and
some
shame
also
to
the
oldest
to
see
her
younger
sister
preferred
before
her
in
marriage
he
then
of
a
certain
pity
framed
his
fancy
toward
her
and
soon
after
married
her
roper
although
he
chose
his
wife
so
quaintly
more
home
was
a
very
happy
one
he
loved
nothing
better
than
to
live
a
simple
family
life
with
his
wife
and
children
round
him
after
six
years
his
wife
died
but
he
quickly
married
again
and
although
his
second
wife
was
a
simple
ignorant
woman
and
somewhat
worldly
too
with
a
sharp
tongue
and
short
temper
she
was
kind
to
her
children
and
the
home
was
still
a
happy
one
more
was
a
great
public
man
but
he
was
first
a
father
and
head
of
his
own
house
he
says
while
i
spend
almost
all
the
day
abroad
amongst
others
and
the
residue
at
home
among
mine
own
i
leave
to
myself
i
mean
to
my
book
no
time
for
when
i
come
home
i
must
commen
with
my
wife
chatter
with
my
children
and
talk
with
my
servants
all
the
which
things
i
reckon
and
account
among
business
forasmuch
as
they
must
of
necessity
be
done
and
done
must
they
needs
be
unless
a
man
will
be
stranger
in
his
own
home
and
in
any
wise
a
man
must
so
fashion
and
order
his
conditions
and
so
appoint
and
dispose
himself
that
he
be
merry
jocund
and
pleasant
among
them
whom
either
nature
hath
provided
or
chance
hath
made
or
he
himself
hath
chosen
to
be
the
fellows
and
companions
of
his
life
so
that
with
too
much
gentle
behaviour
and
familiarity
he
do
not
mar
them
and
by
too
much
sufferance
of
his
servants
make
them
his
masters
at
a
time
too
when
education
was
thought
little
necessary
for
girls
more
taught
his
daughters
as
carefully
as
his
sons
his
eldest
daughter
margaret
mog
as
he
loved
to
call
her
was
so
clever
that
learned
men
praised
and
rewarded
her
when
his
children
married
they
did
not
leave
home
but
came
with
their
husbands
and
wives
to
live
at
chelsea
in
the
beautiful
home
more
had
built
there
so
the
family
was
never
divided
and
more
gathered
a
school
of
children
and
grandchildren
round
him
more
soon
became
a
great
man
henry
vii
indeed
did
not
love
him
so
more
did
not
rise
to
power
while
he
lived
but
henry
vii
died
and
his
son
henry
viii
ruled
the
great
chancellor
cardinal
wolsey
became
more
friend
and
presently
he
was
sent
on
business
for
the
king
to
bruges
it
was
while
more
was
about
the
king
business
in
belgium
that
he
wrote
the
greater
part
of
the
book
by
which
he
is
best
remembered
this
book
is
called
utopia
the
name
means
nowhere
from
two
greek
words
ou
no
and
topos
a
place
the
utopia
like
so
many
other
books
of
which
we
have
read
was
the
outcome
of
the
times
in
which
the
writer
lived
when
more
looked
round
upon
the
england
that
he
knew
he
saw
many
things
that
were
wrong
he
was
a
man
loyal
to
his
king
yet
he
could
not
pretend
to
think
that
the
king
ruled
only
for
the
good
of
his
people
and
not
for
his
own
pleasure
there
was
evil
misery
and
suffering
in
all
the
land
more
longed
to
make
people
see
that
things
were
wrong
he
longed
to
set
the
wrong
right
so
to
teach
men
how
to
do
this
he
invented
a
land
of
nowhere
in
which
there
was
no
evil
or
injustice
in
which
every
one
was
happy
and
good
he
wrote
so
well
about
that
land
that
from
then
till
now
every
one
who
read
utopia
sees
the
beauty
of
more
idea
but
every
one
too
thinks
that
this
land
where
everything
is
right
is
an
impossible
land
thus
more
gave
a
new
word
to
our
language
and
when
we
think
some
idea
beautiful
but
impossible
we
call
it
utopian
as
it
was
the
times
that
made
more
write
his
book
so
it
was
the
times
that
gave
him
the
form
of
it
in
those
days
as
you
know
men
minds
were
stirred
by
the
discovery
of
new
lands
and
chiefly
by
the
discovery
of
america
and
although
it
was
columbus
who
first
discovered
america
he
did
not
give
his
name
to
the
new
country
it
was
instead
named
after
the
italian
explorer
amerigo
vespucci
amerigo
wrote
a
book
about
his
voyages
and
it
was
from
this
book
that
more
got
some
of
his
ideas
for
the
utopia
more
makes
believe
that
one
day
in
antwerp
he
saw
a
man
well
stricken
in
age
with
a
black
face
a
long
beard
and
a
cloak
cast
homely
about
his
shoulders
whom
by
his
favour
and
apparel
forthwith
i
judged
to
be
a
mariner
this
man
was
called
raphael
hythlodaye
and
had
been
with
amerigo
vespucci
in
the
three
last
of
his
voyages
saving
that
in
the
last
voyage
he
came
not
home
again
with
him
for
on
that
voyage
hythlodaye
asked
to
be
left
behind
and
after
amerigo
had
gone
home
he
with
five
friends
set
forth
upon
a
further
voyage
of
discovery
in
their
travels
they
saw
many
marvelous
and
fearful
things
and
at
length
came
to
the
wonderful
land
of
nowhere
but
what
he
told
us
that
he
saw
in
every
country
where
he
came
it
were
very
long
to
declare
more
asked
many
questions
of
this
great
traveler
but
as
for
monsters
because
they
be
no
news
of
them
we
were
nothing
inquisitive
but
to
find
citizens
ruled
by
good
and
wholesome
laws
that
is
an
exceeding
rare
and
hard
thing
the
whole
story
of
the
utopia
is
told
in
the
form
of
talks
between
hythlodaye
more
and
his
friend
peter
giles
and
more
mixes
what
is
real
and
what
is
imaginary
so
quaintly
that
it
is
not
wonderful
that
many
of
the
people
of
his
own
day
thought
that
utopia
was
a
real
place
peter
giles
for
instance
was
a
real
man
and
a
friend
of
more
while
hythlodaye
was
imaginary
his
name
being
made
of
greek
words
meaning
cunning
babbler
nearly
all
the
names
of
the
towns
river
and
people
of
whom
hythlodaye
tells
were
also
made
from
greek
words
and
have
some
meaning
for
instance
achoriens
means
amaurote
and
so
on
more
takes
a
great
deal
of
trouble
to
keep
up
the
mystery
of
this
strange
land
it
was
not
wonderful
that
he
should
for
under
the
pretense
of
a
story
he
said
hard
things
about
the
laws
and
government
of
england
things
which
it
was
treason
to
whisper
in
those
days
treason
was
a
terrible
word
covering
a
great
deal
and
death
and
torture
were
like
to
be
the
fate
of
any
one
who
spoke
his
mind
too
freely
but
more
knew
that
it
would
be
a
hard
matter
to
make
things
better
in
england
as
he
makes
hythlodaye
say
it
is
no
use
trying
to
improve
things
in
a
blundering
fashion
it
is
of
no
use
trying
by
fear
to
drive
into
people
heads
things
they
have
no
mind
to
learn
neither
must
you
forsake
the
ship
in
a
tempest
because
you
can
not
rule
and
keep
down
the
winds
but
you
must
with
a
crafty
wile
and
subtile
train
study
and
endeavour
yourself
as
much
as
in
you
lieth
to
handle
the
matter
wittily
and
handsomely
for
the
purpose
and
that
which
you
can
not
turn
to
good
so
to
order
it
that
it
be
not
very
bad
for
it
is
not
possible
for
all
things
to
be
well
unless
all
men
were
good
which
i
think
will
not
be
yet
in
these
good
many
years
the
utopia
is
divided
into
two
books
the
first
and
shorter
gives
us
what
we
might
call
the
machinery
of
the
tale
it
tells
of
the
meeting
with
hythlodaye
and
more
first
talk
with
him
it
is
not
until
the
beginning
of
the
second
book
that
we
really
hear
about
utopia
and
i
think
if
you
read
the
book
soon
i
would
advise
you
to
begin
with
the
second
part
which
more
wrote
first
in
the
second
book
we
have
most
of
the
story
but
the
first
book
helps
us
to
understand
more
own
times
and
explains
what
he
was
trying
to
do
in
writing
his
tale
at
the
beginning
of
this
book
i
told
you
that
we
should
have
to
talk
of
many
books
which
for
the
present
at
least
you
could
not
hope
to
like
but
which
you
must
be
content
to
be
told
are
good
and
worth
reading
i
may
be
wrong
but
i
think
utopia
is
one
of
these
yet
as
cresacre
more
more
speaking
of
his
writing
says
he
seasoned
always
the
troublesomeness
of
the
matter
with
some
merry
jests
or
pleasant
tales
as
it
were
sugar
whereby
we
drink
up
the
more
willingly
these
wholesome
drugs
which
kind
of
writing
he
hath
used
in
all
his
works
so
that
none
can
ever
by
weary
to
read
them
though
they
be
never
so
long
and
even
if
you
like
the
book
now
you
will
both
like
and
understand
it
much
better
when
you
know
a
little
about
politics
you
will
then
see
too
how
difficult
it
is
to
know
when
more
is
in
earnest
and
when
he
is
merely
poking
fun
for
more
loved
to
jest
yet
as
his
grandson
who
wrote
a
life
of
him
tells
us
whatsoever
jest
he
brought
forth
he
never
laughed
at
any
himself
but
spoke
always
so
sadly
that
few
could
see
by
his
look
whether
he
spoke
in
earnest
or
in
jest
it
would
take
too
long
to
tell
all
about
the
wonderful
island
of
utopia
and
its
people
but
i
must
tell
you
a
little
of
it
and
how
they
regarded
money
all
men
in
this
land
were
equal
no
man
was
idle
neither
was
any
man
with
labor
for
every
one
had
to
work
six
hours
a
day
no
man
was
rich
no
man
was
poor
for
though
no
man
have
anything
yet
every
man
is
rich
for
the
state
gave
him
everything
that
he
needed
so
money
was
hardly
of
any
use
and
gold
and
silver
and
precious
jewels
were
despised
in
the
meantime
gold
and
silver
whereof
money
is
made
they
do
so
use
as
none
of
them
doth
more
esteem
it
than
the
very
nature
of
the
thing
deserveth
and
then
who
doth
not
plainly
see
how
far
it
is
under
iron
as
without
the
which
men
can
no
better
live
than
without
fire
and
water
whereas
to
gold
and
silver
nature
hath
given
no
use
that
we
may
not
well
lack
if
that
the
folly
of
men
had
not
set
it
in
higher
estimation
for
the
rareness
sake
but
of
the
contrary
part
nature
as
a
most
tender
and
loving
mother
hath
placed
the
best
and
most
necessary
things
open
abroad
as
the
air
the
water
and
the
earth
itself
and
hath
removed
and
hid
farthest
from
us
vain
and
unprofitable
things
yet
as
other
countries
still
prized
money
gold
and
silver
was
sometimes
needed
by
the
utopians
but
thought
the
wise
king
and
his
counselors
if
we
lock
it
up
in
towers
and
take
great
care
of
it
the
people
may
begin
to
think
that
gold
is
of
value
for
itself
they
will
begin
to
think
that
we
are
keeping
something
precious
from
them
so
to
set
this
right
they
fell
upon
a
plan
it
was
this
for
whereas
they
eat
and
drink
in
earthen
and
glass
vessels
which
indeed
be
curiously
and
properly
made
and
yet
be
of
very
small
value
of
gold
and
silver
they
make
other
vessels
that
serve
for
most
vile
uses
not
only
in
their
common
halls
but
in
every
man
private
house
furthermore
of
the
same
metals
they
make
great
chains
and
fetters
and
gyves
wherein
they
tie
their
bondmen
finally
whosoever
for
any
offense
be
infamed
by
their
ears
hang
rings
of
gold
upon
their
fingers
they
wear
rings
of
gold
and
about
their
necks
chains
of
gold
and
in
conclusion
their
heads
be
tied
about
with
gold
thus
by
all
means
that
may
be
they
procure
to
have
gold
and
silver
among
them
in
reproach
and
infamy
and
therefore
these
metals
which
other
nations
do
as
grievously
and
sorrowfully
forego
as
in
a
manner
from
their
own
lives
if
they
should
altogether
at
once
be
taken
from
the
utopians
no
man
there
would
think
that
he
had
lost
the
worth
of
a
farthing
they
gather
also
pearls
by
the
seaside
and
diamonds
and
carbuncles
upon
certain
rocks
yet
they
seek
not
for
them
but
by
chance
finding
them
they
cut
and
polish
them
and
therewith
they
deck
their
young
infants
which
like
as
in
the
first
years
of
their
childhood
they
make
much
and
be
fond
and
proud
of
such
ornaments
so
when
they
be
a
little
more
grown
in
years
and
discretion
perceiving
that
none
but
children
do
wear
such
toys
and
trifles
they
lay
them
away
even
of
their
own
shamefastness
without
any
bidding
of
their
parents
even
as
our
children
when
they
wax
big
do
caste
away
nuts
brooches
and
dolls
therefore
these
laws
and
customs
which
be
so
far
different
from
all
other
nations
how
divers
fancies
also
and
minds
they
do
cause
did
i
never
so
plainly
perceive
as
in
the
ambassadors
of
the
anemolians
these
ambassadors
came
to
amaurote
whiles
i
was
there
and
because
they
came
to
entreat
of
great
and
weighty
matters
three
citizens
a
piece
out
of
every
city
of
utopia
were
come
thither
before
them
but
all
the
ambassadors
of
the
next
countries
which
had
been
there
before
and
knew
the
fashions
and
manners
of
the
utopians
among
whom
they
perceived
no
honour
given
to
sumptuous
and
costly
apparel
silks
to
be
contemned
gold
also
to
be
infamed
and
reproachful
were
wont
to
come
thither
in
very
homely
and
simple
apparel
but
the
anemolians
because
they
dwell
far
thence
and
had
very
little
acquaintance
with
them
hearing
that
they
were
all
apparelled
alike
and
that
very
rudely
and
homely
thinking
them
not
to
have
the
things
which
they
did
not
wear
being
therefore
more
proud
than
wise
determined
in
the
gorgeousness
of
their
apparel
to
represent
very
gods
and
with
the
bright
shining
and
glistening
of
their
gay
clothing
to
dazzle
the
eyes
of
the
silly
poor
utopians
so
there
came
in
three
ambassadors
with
a
hundred
servants
all
apparelled
in
changeable
colours
the
most
of
them
in
silks
the
ambassadors
themselves
for
at
home
in
their
own
country
they
were
noble
men
in
cloth
of
gold
with
great
chains
of
gold
with
gold
hanging
at
their
ears
with
gold
rings
upon
their
fingers
with
brooches
and
of
gold
upon
their
caps
which
glistered
full
of
pearls
and
precious
stones
to
be
short
trimmed
and
adorned
with
all
those
things
which
among
the
utopians
were
either
the
punishment
of
bondmen
or
the
reproach
of
infamed
persons
or
else
trifles
for
young
children
to
play
withall
ornaments
therefore
it
would
have
done
a
man
good
at
his
heart
to
have
seen
how
proudly
they
displayed
their
peacocks
feathers
how
much
they
made
of
their
painted
sheathes
and
how
loftily
they
set
forth
and
advanced
themselves
when
they
compared
their
gallant
apparel
with
the
poor
raiment
of
the
utopians
for
all
the
people
were
swarmed
forth
into
the
streets
and
on
the
other
side
it
was
no
less
pleasure
to
consider
how
much
they
were
deceived
and
how
far
they
missed
their
purpose
being
contrary
ways
taken
than
they
thought
they
should
have
been
for
to
the
eyes
of
all
the
utopians
except
very
few
which
had
been
in
other
countries
for
some
reasonable
cause
all
that
gorgeousness
of
apparel
seemed
shameful
and
reproachful
in
so
much
that
they
most
reverently
saluted
the
vilest
and
most
abject
of
them
for
lords
passing
over
the
ambassadors
themselves
without
any
honour
judging
them
by
their
wearing
of
golden
chains
to
be
bondmen
yea
you
should
have
seen
children
also
that
had
cast
away
their
pearls
and
precious
stones
when
they
saw
the
like
sticking
upon
the
ambassadors
caps
dig
and
push
their
mothers
under
the
sides
saying
thus
to
them
mother
how
great
a
lubber
doth
yet
wear
pearls
and
precious
stones
as
though
he
were
a
little
child
still
but
the
mother
yea
and
that
also
in
good
earnest
son
saith
she
think
he
be
some
of
the
ambassadors
fools
some
found
fault
with
their
golden
chains
as
to
no
use
nor
purpose
being
so
small
and
weak
that
a
bondman
might
easily
break
them
and
again
so
wide
and
large
that
when
it
pleased
him
he
might
cast
them
off
and
run
away
at
liberty
whither
he
would
but
when
the
ambassadors
had
been
there
a
day
or
two
and
saw
so
great
abundance
of
gold
so
lightly
esteemed
yea
in
no
less
reproach
than
it
was
with
them
in
honour
and
besides
that
more
gold
in
the
chains
and
gyves
of
one
fugitive
bondman
than
all
the
costly
ornaments
of
their
three
was
worth
then
began
their
courage
and
for
very
shame
laid
away
all
that
gorgeous
array
whereof
they
were
so
proud
and
especially
when
they
had
talked
familiarly
with
the
utopians
and
had
learned
all
their
fashions
and
opinions
for
they
marvel
that
any
man
be
so
foolish
as
to
have
delight
and
pleasure
in
the
glistering
of
a
little
trifling
stone
which
may
behold
any
of
the
stars
or
else
the
sun
itself
or
that
any
man
is
so
mad
as
to
count
himself
the
nobler
for
the
smaller
or
finer
thread
of
wool
which
wool
be
it
now
in
never
so
fine
a
spun
thread
did
once
a
sheep
wear
and
yet
was
she
all
that
time
no
other
thing
than
a
sheep
chapter
xxxviii
the
death
of
sir
thomas
more
there
is
much
that
is
quaint
much
that
is
deeply
wise
in
utopia
still
no
one
is
likely
to
agree
with
all
he
says
or
to
think
that
we
could
all
be
happy
in
a
world
such
as
he
describes
for
one
thing
to
those
of
us
who
love
color
it
would
seem
a
dull
world
indeed
were
we
all
forced
to
dress
in
undyed
sheep
wool
and
if
jewels
and
gold
with
all
their
lovely
lights
and
gleamings
were
but
the
signs
of
degradation
each
one
who
reads
it
may
find
something
in
the
utopia
that
he
would
rather
have
otherwise
but
each
one
too
will
find
something
to
make
him
think
more
was
not
the
first
to
write
about
a
happy
land
where
every
one
lived
in
peace
and
where
only
justice
reigned
and
if
he
got
some
of
his
ideas
of
the
island
from
the
discoveries
of
the
new
world
he
got
many
more
from
the
new
learning
for
long
before
plato
a
greek
writer
had
told
of
a
land
very
like
utopia
in
his
book
called
the
republic
and
the
new
learning
had
made
that
book
known
to
the
people
of
england
we
think
of
the
utopia
as
english
literature
yet
we
must
remember
that
more
wrote
it
in
latin
and
it
was
not
translated
into
english
until
several
years
after
his
death
the
first
english
translation
was
made
by
ralph
robinson
and
although
since
then
there
have
been
other
translation
which
in
some
ways
are
more
correct
there
has
never
been
one
with
more
charm
for
robinson
quaint
english
keeps
for
us
something
of
the
spirit
of
more
time
and
of
more
self
in
a
way
no
modern
and
more
perfect
translation
can
the
utopia
was
not
written
for
one
time
or
for
one
people
even
before
it
was
translated
into
english
it
had
been
translated
into
dutch
italian
german
and
french
and
was
largely
read
all
over
the
continent
it
is
still
read
by
all
who
are
interested
in
the
life
of
the
people
by
all
who
think
that
in
this
best
of
all
possible
worlds
things
might
still
be
made
better
more
wrote
many
other
books
both
in
english
and
in
latin
and
besides
being
a
busy
author
he
led
a
busy
life
for
blustering
burly
selfish
king
henry
loved
the
gentle
witty
lawyer
and
again
and
again
made
use
of
his
wits
and
so
from
time
to
time
was
he
by
the
king
advanced
continuing
in
his
singular
favour
and
trusty
service
twenty
years
and
above
roper
it
was
not
only
for
his
business
cleverness
that
king
henry
loved
sir
thomas
it
was
for
his
merry
witty
talk
when
business
was
done
and
came
the
king
and
queen
would
call
for
him
to
be
merry
with
them
thus
it
came
about
that
sir
thomas
could
hardly
ever
get
home
to
his
wife
and
children
where
he
most
longed
to
be
then
he
began
to
pretend
to
be
less
clever
than
he
was
so
that
the
king
might
not
want
so
much
of
his
company
but
henry
would
sometimes
follow
more
to
his
home
at
chelsea
where
he
had
built
a
beautiful
house
sometimes
he
came
quite
unexpectedly
to
dinner
once
he
came
and
after
dinner
in
a
fair
garden
of
his
walked
with
him
by
the
space
of
an
hour
holding
his
arm
about
his
neck
as
soon
as
the
king
was
gone
more
said
to
him
that
he
should
be
happy
seeing
the
king
was
so
friendly
with
him
for
with
no
other
man
was
he
so
familiar
not
even
with
wolsey
i
thank
our
lord
answered
more
i
find
in
his
grace
a
very
good
lord
indeed
and
i
believe
he
doth
as
singularly
favour
me
as
any
subject
within
the
realm
howbeit
son
roper
i
may
tell
thee
i
have
no
cause
to
be
proud
thereof
for
if
my
head
would
win
him
a
castle
in
france
it
should
not
fail
to
go
and
sir
thomas
was
not
wrong
meanwhile
however
the
king
heaped
favor
upon
him
he
became
treasurer
of
the
exchequer
speaker
of
the
house
of
commons
chancellor
of
the
duchy
of
lancaster
and
last
of
all
lord
chancellor
of
england
this
was
a
very
great
honor
and
as
more
was
a
layman
the
honor
was
for
him
greater
than
usual
for
he
was
the
first
layman
to
be
made
chancellor
until
then
the
chancellor
had
always
been
some
powerful
churchman
more
was
not
eager
for
these
honors
he
would
much
rather
have
lived
a
simple
family
life
but
bluff
king
hal
was
no
easy
master
to
serve
if
he
chose
to
honor
a
man
and
set
him
high
that
man
could
but
submit
so
as
erasmus
says
more
was
dragged
into
public
life
and
honor
and
being
thus
dragged
in
troubles
were
not
slow
to
follow
henry
grew
tired
of
his
wife
queen
catherine
but
the
pope
would
not
allow
him
to
divorce
her
so
that
he
might
marry
another
then
henry
quarreled
with
the
pope
the
pope
he
said
should
no
longer
have
power
in
england
he
should
no
longer
be
head
of
the
church
but
the
people
must
henceforth
look
to
the
king
as
such
this
more
could
not
do
he
tried
to
keep
out
of
the
quarrel
he
was
true
to
his
king
as
king
but
he
felt
that
he
must
be
true
to
his
religion
too
to
him
the
pope
was
the
representative
of
christ
on
earth
and
he
could
look
to
no
other
as
head
of
the
church
when
first
more
had
come
into
the
king
service
henry
bade
him
first
look
unto
god
and
after
god
unto
him
of
this
his
chancellor
now
reminded
him
and
laying
down
his
seal
of
office
he
went
home
hoping
to
live
the
rest
of
his
days
in
peace
but
that
was
not
to
be
it
is
perilous
striving
with
princes
said
a
i
would
wish
you
somewhat
to
incline
to
the
king
pleasure
the
anger
of
princes
is
death
is
that
all
replied
more
calmly
then
in
good
faith
the
difference
between
you
and
me
is
but
this
that
i
shall
die
day
and
you
so
it
fell
out
there
came
a
day
when
messengers
came
to
happy
home
and
the
beloved
father
was
led
away
to
imprisonment
and
death
for
fifteen
months
he
was
kept
in
the
tower
during
all
that
time
his
cheerful
steadfastness
did
not
waver
he
wrote
long
letters
to
his
children
and
chiefly
to
meg
his
daughter
when
pen
and
ink
were
taken
away
from
him
he
still
wrote
with
coal
in
these
months
he
became
an
old
man
bent
and
crippled
with
disease
but
though
his
body
was
feeble
his
mind
was
clear
his
spirit
bright
as
ever
no
threats
or
promises
could
shake
his
purpose
he
could
not
and
would
not
own
henry
as
head
of
the
church
at
last
the
end
came
in
westminster
hall
more
was
tried
for
treason
and
found
guilty
from
westminster
through
the
thronging
streets
he
was
led
back
again
to
the
tower
in
front
of
the
prisoner
an
ax
was
carried
the
edge
being
turned
towards
him
that
was
the
sign
to
all
who
saw
that
he
was
to
die
as
the
sad
procession
reached
the
tower
wharf
there
was
a
pause
a
young
and
beautiful
woman
darted
from
the
crowd
and
caring
not
for
the
soldiers
who
surrounded
him
unafraid
of
their
swords
and
halberds
she
reached
the
old
man
side
and
threw
herself
sobbing
on
his
breast
in
was
margaret
more
beloved
daughter
who
fearing
that
never
again
she
might
see
her
father
thus
came
in
the
open
street
to
say
farewell
she
clung
to
him
and
kissed
him
in
sight
of
all
again
and
again
but
no
word
could
she
say
save
oh
my
father
oh
my
father
then
sir
thomas
holding
her
tenderly
comforted
and
blessed
her
and
at
last
she
took
her
arms
from
about
his
neck
and
he
passed
on
but
margaret
could
not
yet
leave
him
scarcely
had
she
gone
ten
steps
than
suddenly
she
turned
back
once
more
breaking
through
the
guard
she
threw
her
arms
about
him
not
a
word
did
sir
thomas
say
but
as
he
held
her
there
the
tears
fell
fast
from
his
eyes
while
from
the
crowd
around
broke
the
sound
of
weeping
even
the
guards
wept
for
pity
but
at
last
with
full
and
heavy
hearts
father
and
daughter
parted
dear
meg
sir
thomas
wrote
for
the
last
time
i
never
liked
your
manner
better
towards
me
than
when
you
kissed
me
last
for
i
like
when
daughterly
love
and
dear
charity
hath
no
leisure
to
look
to
worldly
courtesy
next
day
he
died
cheerfully
as
he
had
lived
to
the
last
he
jested
in
his
quaint
fashion
the
scaffold
was
so
badly
built
that
it
was
ready
to
fall
so
sir
thomas
jesting
turned
to
the
lieutenant
i
pray
you
master
lieutenant
he
said
see
me
safe
up
and
for
my
coming
down
let
me
shift
for
myself
he
desired
the
people
to
pray
for
him
and
having
kissed
the
executioner
in
token
of
forgiveness
he
laid
his
head
upon
the
block
so
passed
sir
thomas
more
out
of
the
world
to
god
his
death
was
mourned
by
many
far
and
near
had
we
been
master
of
such
a
servant
said
the
emperor
charles
when
he
heard
of
it
we
would
rather
have
lost
the
best
city
of
our
dominions
than
have
lost
such
a
worthy
counselor
more
died
for
his
faith
that
of
the
catholic
church
he
as
others
saw
with
grief
that
there
was
much
within
the
church
that
needed
to
be
made
better
but
he
trusted
it
would
be
made
better
to
break
away
from
the
church
to
doubt
the
headship
of
the
pope
seemed
to
him
such
wickedness
that
he
hated
the
reformers
and
wrote
against
them
and
although
in
utopia
he
allowed
his
happy
people
to
have
full
freedom
in
matters
of
religion
in
real
life
he
treated
sternly
and
even
cruelly
those
protestants
with
whom
he
had
to
deal
yet
the
reformation
was
stirring
all
the
world
and
while
sir
thomas
more
cheerfully
and
steadfastly
died
for
the
catholic
faith
there
were
others
in
england
who
as
cheerfully
lived
worked
and
died
for
the
protestant
faith
we
have
little
to
do
with
these
reformers
in
this
book
except
in
so
far
as
they
touch
our
literature
and
it
is
to
them
that
we
owe
our
present
bible
first
william
tyndale
amid
difficulties
and
trials
translated
afresh
the
new
and
part
of
the
old
testament
and
died
the
death
of
a
martyr
in
miles
coverdale
followed
him
with
a
complete
translation
in
happier
times
for
henry
viii
for
his
own
purposes
wished
to
spread
a
knowledge
of
the
bible
and
commanded
that
a
copy
of
coverdale
bible
should
be
placed
in
every
parish
church
and
although
coverdale
was
not
so
great
a
scholar
as
tyndale
his
language
was
fine
and
stately
with
a
musical
ring
about
the
words
and
to
this
day
we
still
keep
his
version
of
the
psalms
in
the
prayer
book
other
versions
of
the
bible
followed
these
until
in
in
the
reign
of
james
i
and
vi
the
translation
which
we
use
was
at
length
published
that
has
stood
and
still
stands
the
test
of
time
and
had
we
no
other
reason
to
treasure
it
we
would
still
for
its
simple
musical
language
look
upon
it
as
one

fine

how
the
sonnet
came
to
england
upon
a
january
day
in
two
gaily
decked
barges
met
upon
the
thames
in
the
one
sat
a
man
of
forty
his
fair
hair
and
beard
were
already
touched
with
gray
his
face
was
grave
and
thoughtful
and
his
eyes
gave
to
it
a
curious
expression
for
the
right
was
dull
and
sightless
while
with
the
left
he
looked
about
him
sharply
this
was
sir
john
russell
gentleman
of
the
privy
chamber
soldier
ambassador
and
favorite
of
king
henry
viii
fighting
in
the
king
french
wars
he
had
lost
the
sight
of
his
right
eye
since
then
he
had
led
a
busy
life
in
court
and
camp
passing
through
many
perilous
adventures
in
the
service
of
his
master
and
now
once
again
by
the
king
commands
he
was
about
to
set
forth
for
italy
as
the
other
barge
drew
near
russell
saw
that
in
it
there
sat
thomas
wyatt
a
young
poet
and
courtier
of
he
was
tall
and
handsome
and
his
thick
dark
hair
framed
a
pale
clever
face
which
now
looked
listless
but
as
his
dreamy
poet
eyes
met
those
of
sir
john
they
lighted
up
the
two
men
greeted
each
other
familiarly
whither
away
cried
wyatt
for
he
saw
that
russell
was
prepared
for
a
journey
to
italy
sent
by
the
king
to
italy
the
land
of
poetry
the
idea
fired
the
poet
soul
and
i
at
once
he
answered
will
if
you
please
ask
leave
get
money
and
go
with
you
no
man
more
welcome
answered
the
ambassador
and
so
it
was
settled
between
them
the
money
and
the
leave
were
both
forthcoming
and
thomas
wyatt
passed
to
italy
this
chance
meeting
and
this
visit
to
italy
are
of
importance
to
our
literature
because
they
led
to
a
new
kind
of
poem
being
written
in
english
this
was
the
sonnet
the
sonnet
is
a
poem
of
fourteen
lines
and
is
perhaps
the
most
difficult
kind
of
poem
to
write
it
is
divided
into
two
parts
the
first
part
has
eight
lines
and
ought
only
to
have
two
rimes
that
is
supposing
we
take
words
riming
with
love
and
king
for
our
rimes
four
lines
must
rime
with
love
and
four
with
king
the
rimes
too
must
come
in
a
certain
order
the
first
fourth
fifth
and
eighth
lines
must
rime
and
the
second
third
sixth
and
seventh
this
first
part
is
called
the
octave
from
the
latin
word
octo
eight
the
second
part
contains
six
lines
and
is
therefore
called
the
sextet
from
the
latin
word
sex
meaning
six
the
sextet
may
have
either
two
or
three
rimes
and
these
may
be
arranged
in
almost
any
order
but
a
correct
sonnet
ought
not
to
end
with
a
couplet
that
is
two
riming
lines
however
very
many
good
writers
in
english
do
so
end
their
sonnets
as
the
sonnet
is
so
bound
about
with
rules
it
often
makes
the
thought
which
it
expresses
sound
a
little
unreal
and
for
that
very
reason
it
suited
the
times
in
which
wyatt
lived
in
those
days
every
knight
had
a
lady
whom
he
vowed
to
serve
and
love
he
took
her
side
in
every
quarrel
and
if
he
were
a
poet
or
even
if
he
were
not
he
wrote
verses
in
her
honor
and
sighed
and
died
for
her
the
lady
was
not
supposed
to
do
anything
in
return
she
might
at
most
smile
upon
her
knight
or
drop
her
glove
that
he
might
be
made
happy
by
picking
it
up
in
fact
the
more
disdainful
the
lady
might
be
the
better
it
was
for
then
the
poet
could
write
the
more
passionate
verses
for
all
this
love
and
service
was
it
was
merely
a
fashion
and
not
meant
to
be
taken
seriously
a
man
might
have
a
wife
whom
he
loved
dearly
and
yet
write
poems
in
honor
of
another
lady
without
thought
of
wrong
the
sonnet
having
something
very
artificial
in
it
just
suited
this
love
petrarch
the
great
italian
poet
from
whom
you
remember
chaucer
had
learned
much
and
whom
perhaps
he
had
once
met
made
use
of
this
kind
of
poem
in
his
sonnets
he
told
his
love
of
a
fair
lady
laura
and
made
her
famous
for
all
time
of
course
when
wyatt
came
to
italy
petrarch
had
long
been
dead
but
his
poems
were
as
living
as
in
the
days
of
chaucer
and
it
was
from
petrarch
works
that
wyatt
learned
this
new
kind
of
poem
and
it
was
he
who
first
made
use
of
it
in
english
he
too
like
petrarch
addressed
his
sonnets
to
a
lady
and
the
lady
he
took
for
his
love
was
queen
anne
boleyn
as
he
is
the
first
he
is
perhaps
one
of
the
roughest
of
our
sonnet
writers
but
into
his
sonnets
he
wrought
something
of
manly
strength
he
does
not
sigh
so
much
as
other
poets
of
the
age
he
says
in
fact
if
i
serve
my
lady
faithfully
i
deserve
reward
here
is
one
of
his
sonnets
which
he
calls
the
lover
compareth
his
state
to
a
ship
in
perilous
storm
tossed
by
the
sea
my
galléy
charged
with
forgetfulness
through
sharpe
seas
in
winter
night
doth
pass
rock
and
rock
and
eke
my
foe
alas
that
is
my
lord
steereth
with
cruelness
and
every
oar
a
thought
in
readiness
as
though
that
death
were
light
in
such
a
case
an
endless
wind
doth
tear
the
sail
apace
of
forcéd
sighs
and
trusty
fearfulness
a
rain
of
tears
a
cloud
of
dark
disdain
have
done
the
wearied
cords
great

wreathéd
with
error
and
with
ignorance

his
that
lead
me
to
this
pain
drownéd
is
reason
that
should
me
comfort
and
i
remain
despairing
of
the
port
it
is
not
perfect
it
is
not
even
wyatt
best
sonnet
but
it
is
one
of
the
most
simple
to
make
it
run
smoothly
we
must
sound
the
ed
in
those
words
ending
in
ed
as
a
separate
syllable
and
we
must
put
a
final
e
to
sharp
in
the
second
line
and
sound
that
then
you
see
the
rimes
are
not
very
good
to
begin
with
the
first
eight
all
have
sounds
of
then
alas
and
pass
do
not
rime
with
case
and
apace
nor
do
comfort
and
port
i
point
these
things
out
so
that
later
on
you
may
see
for
yourselves
how
much
more
polished
and
elegant
a
thing
the
sonnet
becomes
although
wyatt
was
our
first
sonnet
writer
some
of
his
poems
which
are
not
sonnets
are
much
more
musical
especially
some
he
wrote
for
music
perhaps
best
of
all
you
will
like
his
satire
of
the
mean
and
sure
estate
a
satire
is
a
poem
which
holds
up
to
scorn
and
ridicule
wickedness
folly
or
stupidity
it
is
the
sword
of
literature
and
often
its
edge
was
keen
its
point
sharp
my
mother
maids
when
they
do
sew
and
spin
they
sing
a
song
made
of
the
fieldish
mouse
that
for
because
her
was

thin
would
needs
go
see
her
townish

quoth
she
a

hence
from

she
dwelleth

she
lieth
warm
and
dry
in

of
down
the

doth
not
defile
her
tender

she
labours
not
as
richly
she
feeds
and
at
the
rich

for

meat
she
need
not
crave
nor
cry

by

of

spareth
for
no
peril
she
feeds
on
boil
meat
bake

and
roast
and
hath
therefore
no
whit
of

so
forth
she
goes
trusting
of
all
this
wealth
with
her
sister
her
part
so
for
to
shape
that
if

keep

in

so
was
the
wretch
aghast
at

she
askéd
softly
who
was
there

as
well
as
she
could
quoth

by

well
quoth
she

by
the
rood
she
feasted
her
that
joy
it
was
to
tell
the
fare
they
had
they
drank
the
wine
so
clear
and
as
to

now
and
then
it
fell
so
cheered
her
with

what
cheer
amid
this
joy
befell
a
sorry
chance
that
welladay
the
stranger
bought
full
dear
the
fare
she
had
for
as
she
looked

under

she
spied

flaming
eyes
in

with
sharp
ears
in

not

such
beast
before
yet
had
nature
taught
her
after
her
guise
to
know
her
foe
and
dread
him
evermore
the
town
mouse
fled
she
knew
whither
to
go
the

no

wonders
sore
fear
of
her

at

she
wished

did
skip

and
eke
her
chance

so
at

her

did
trip
and
ere

might
recover
it
again
the
traitor
cat
had
caught
her
by
the
hip
and
made
her
there
against

that
had
forgot
her
poor
surety
and
rest
for
seeming
wealth
wherein
she
thought

the
beginning
of

the
poet
with
whose
verses
the
last
chapter
ended
was
named
henry
howard
earl
of
surrey
the
son
of
a
noble
and
ancient
house
surrey
lived
a
gay
life
in
court
and
camp
proud
he
was
often
in
trouble
more
than
once
in
prison
in
youth
he
was
called
the
most
foolish
proud
boy
in
england
and
at
the
age
of
thirty
still
young
and
gay
and
full
of
life
he
died
upon
the
scaffold
accused
of
treason
yet
innocent
he
fell
a
victim
to
the
wrath
of
princes
the
wrath
of
that
king
henry
viii
surrey
lived
at
the
same
time
as
wyatt
and
although
he
was
fourteen
years
younger
was
his
friend
together
they
are
the
forerunners
of
our
modern
poetry
they
are
nearly
always
spoken
of
together
wyatt
and
surrey
surrey
and
wyatt
like
wyatt
surrey
followed
the
italian
poets
like
wyatt
he
wrote
sonnets
but
whereas
are
rough
surrey
are
smooth
and
musical
although
he
does
not
keep
the
rules
about
rime
endings
one
who
wrote
not
long
after
the
time
of
wyatt
and
surrey
says
of
them
sir
thomas
wyatt
the
elder
and
henry
earl
of
surrey
were
the
two
chieftains
who
having
travelled
in
italy
and
there
tasted
the
sweet
and
stately
measures
and
style
of
the
italian
poesie
greatly
polished
our
rude
and
homely
manner
of
vulgar
poesie
from
that
it
had
been
before
and
for
that
cause
may
justly
be
said
the
first
reformers
of
our
english
metre
and
syle
i
repute
them
for
the
two
chief
lanterns
of
light
to
all
others
that
have
since
employed
their
pens
on
english
poesie
puttenham
art
of
english
poesie
a
later
has
called
surrey
the
first
refiner
of
our
language
and
just
as
there
comes
a
time
in
our
own
lives
when
we
begin
to
care
not
only
for
the
story
but
for
the
words
in
which
a
story
is
told
and
for
the
way
in
which
those
words
are
used
so
too
there
comes
such
a
time
in
the
life
of
a
nation
and
this
time
for
england
we
may
perhaps
date
from
wyatt
and
surrey
before
then
there
were
men
who
tried
to
use
the
best
words
in
the
best
way
but
they
did
it
unknowingly
as
birds
might
sing
the
language
too
in
which
they
wrote
was
still
a
growing
thing
when
surrey
wrote
it
had
nearly
reached
its
finished
state
and
he
helped
to
finish
and
polish
it
courthope
as
the
fashion
was
surrey
chose
a
lady
to
whom
to
address
his
verses
she
was
the
little
lady
elizabeth
whose
father
had
died
a
prisoner
in
the
tower
she
was
only
ten
when
surrey
made
her
famous
in
song
under
the
name
of
geraldine
here
is
a
sonnet
in
which
he
seeing
the
joy
of
all
nature
at
the
coming
of
spring
mourns
that
his
lady
is
still
unkind
the
sweet
season
that
bud
and
bloom
forth
brings
with
green
hath
clad
the
hill
and
eke
the
vale
the
nightingale
with
feathers
new
she
sings
the
turtle
to
her
mate
hath
told
her
tale
summer
is
come
for
every
spray
now
springs
the
hart
hath
hung
his
old
head
on
the
pale
the
buck
in
haste
his
winter
coat
he
flings
the
fishes
float
with
new
repaired
scale
the
adder
all
her
slough
away
she
lings
the
swift
swallow
pursueth
the
flies
small
the
her
honey
now
she
mings
winter
is
worn
that
was
the
flowers
bale
and
thus
i
see
among
these
pleasant
things
each
care
decays
and
yet
my
sorrow
springs
besides
following
wyatt
in
making
the
sonnet
known
to
english
readers
surrey
was
the
first
to
write
in
blank
verse
that
is
in
long
lines
which
do
not
rime
this
is
a
kind
of
poetry
in
which
some
of
the
grandest
poems
in
our
language
are
written
and
we
should
remember
surrey
as
the
first
maker
of
it
for
with
very
little
change
the
rules
which
surrey
laid
down
have
been
followed
by
our
best
poets
ever
since
so
from
the
sixteenth
century
till
now
there
has
been
far
less
change
in
our
poetry
than
in
the
five
centuries
before
you
can
see
this
for
yourself
if
you
compare
surrey
poetry
with
layamon
or
langland
and
then
with
some
of
the
blank
verse
near
the
end
of
this
book
it
was
in
translating
part
of
virgil
aeneid
that
surrey
used
blank
verse
virgil
was
an
ancient
roman
poet
born
who
in
his
book
called
the
aeneid
told
of
the
wanderings
and
adventures
of
aeneas
and
part
of
this
poem
surrey
translated
into
english
this
is
how
he
tells
of
the
way
in
which
aeneas
saved
his
old
father
by
carrying
him
on
his
shoulders
out
of
the
burning
town
of
troy
when
the
crackling
flame
was
heard
throughout
the
walls

more

drew

me

with

at

back
my

thus
did
we
pass
by

night

me

those
years
from

death
of

henry
viii
to
the
end
of
the
first
twenty
years
of
elizabeth
reign
were
years
of
action
rather
than
of
production
they
were
years
of
struggle
during
which
england
was
swayed
to
and
fro
in
the
fight
of
religions
they
were
years
during
which
the
fury
of
the
storm
of
the
reformation
worked
itself
out
but
although
they
were
such
unquiet
years
they
were
also
years
of
growth
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
there
blossomed
forth
one
of
the
fairest
seasons
of
our
literature
we
call
the
whole
group
of
authors
who
sprang
up
at
this
time
the
elizabethans
after
the
name
of
the
queen
in
whose
reign
they
lived
and
wrote

know

little

calls
up

brilliant

great
names
come
crowding

divines
it
would
be
impossible
to
tell
of
all
in

so
we
must
choose
the
greatest
from
the
noble
array
and
foremost
among
them
comes
edmund
spenser
for
the
glory
of
the
new
literature
broke

green
history
of
english
people
if
we
could
stand
aside
as
it
were
and
take
a
wide
view
of
all
our
early
literature
it
would
seem
as
if
the
names
of
chaucer
and
spenser
stood
out
above
all
others
like
great
mountains
the
others
are
valleys
between
they
are
pleasant
fields
in
which
to
wander
in
which
to
gather
flowers
not
landmarks
for
all
the
world
like
chaucer
and
spenser
and
although
it
is
easier
and
safer
for
children
to
wander
in
the
meadows
and
gather
meadow
flowers
they
still
may
look
up
to
the
mountains
and
hope
to
climb
them
some
day
edmund
spenser
was
born
in
london
in
and
was
the
son
of
a
poor
clothworker
or
tailor
he
went
to
school
at
the
merchant
taylors
school
which
had
then
been
newly
founded
that
his
father
was
very
poor
we
know
for
edmund
spenser
name
appears
among
certain
poor
scholars
of
the
schools
about
london
who
received
money
and
clothes
from
a
fund
left
by
a
rich
man
to
help
poor
children
at
school
when
he
was
about
seventeen
edmund
went
to
cambridge
receiving
for
his
journey
a
sum
of
ten
shillings
from
the
fund
from
which
he
had
already
received
help
at
school
he
entered
college
as
a
sizar
that
is
in
return
for
doing
the
work
of
a
servant
he
received
free
board
and
lodging
in
his
college
a
sizar
life
was
not
always
a
happy
one
for
many
of
the
other
scholars
or
gentlemen
commoners
looked
down
upon
them
because
of
their
poverty
and
this
poverty
they
could
not
hide
for
the
sizars
were
obliged
to
wear
a
different
cap
and
gown
from
that
of
the
gentlemen
commoners
but
of
how
spenser
fared
at
college
we
know
nothing
except
that
he
was
often
ill
and
that
he
made
two
lifelong
friends
that
he
loved
his
university
however
we
learn
from
his
poems
when
he
tenderly
speaks
of
my
mother
cambridge
when
he
left
college
spenser
was
he
was
poor
and
it
would
seem
ill
so
he
did
not
return
to
london
but
went
to
live
with
relatives
in
the
country
in
lancashire
and
there
about
the
wasteful
woods
and
forest
wide
he
wandered
gathering
new
life
and
strength
taking
all
a
poet
joy
in
the
beauty
and
the
freedom
of
a
country
life
for
ylike
to
me
was
liberty
and

he
says
and
here
among
the

woods
he
met

when

an

spenser
went
and
through
his
friend
he
came
to
know
sir
philip
sidney
a
true
gentleman
and
a
poet
like
himself
who
in
turn
made
him
known
to
the
great
earl

found

live
for

became
the
poet
friend
and

and
gave
him
a
post
as
secretary
in

house

in
those
days
no

could
live

was
still
a
graceful
toy

if
a
poor
man
wished
to
toy
with
it
he
must
either
starve
or
find
a
rich

to
be
his
patron
to
give
him
work
to
do
that
would
leave
him

a

spenser
found
in

house
the
poor

met
many
of

greatest

of
the
court
of

business
he
went
to
ireland
and
to
the
continent
seeing
new
sights
meeting
the
men
and
women
of
the
great
world
so
that
a
new
and
brilliant
life
seemed
opening
for
him
yet
when
a
few
years
later
spenser
published
his
first
great
poem
it
did
not
tell
of
courts
or
courtiers
but
of
simple
country
sights
and
sounds
this
book
is
called
the
calendar
as
it
contains
twelve
poems
one
for
every
month
of
the
year
in
it
spenser
sings
of
his
fair
lost
lady
rosalind

the

made
the
new
poet
famous
spenser
was
advanced
at
court
and
soon
after
went
to
ireland
in
the
train
of
the
as
secretary
of
state
at
that
time
ireland
was
filled
with
storm
and
anger
with
revolt
against
english
rule
with
strife
among
the
irish
nobles
themselves
spain
also
was
eagerly
looking
to
ireland
as
a
point
from
which
to
strike
at
england
war
misery
poverty
were
abroad
in
all
the
land
yet
amid
the
horrid
sights
and
sounds
of
battle
spenser
found
time
to
write
after
eight
years
spent
in
the
north
of
ireland
spenser
was
given
a
post
which
took
him
south
his
new
home
was
the
old
castle
of
kilcolman
in
cork
it
was
surrounded
by
fair
wooded
country
but
to
spenser
it
seemed
a
desert
he
had
gone
to
ireland
as
to
exile
hoping
that
it
was
merely
a
to
some
great
appointment
in
england
whither
he
longed
to
return
now
after
eight
years
he
found
himself
still
in
exile
he
had
no
love
for
ireland
and
felt
himself
lonely
and
forsaken
there
but
soon
there
came
another
great
elizabethan
to
share
his
loneliness
this
was
sir
walter
raleigh
who
being
out
of
favor
with
his
queen
took
refuge
in
his
irish
estates
until
her
anger
should
pass
the
two
great
men
thus
alone
among
the
wild
irish
made
friends
and
they
had
many
a
talk
together
there
within
the
gray
stone
walls
of
the
old
castle
spenser
read
the
first
part
of
his
book
the
faery
queen
to
raleigh
spenser
had
long
been
at
work
upon
this
great
poem
it
was
divided
into
parts
and
each
part
was
called
a
book
three
books
were
now
finished
and
raleigh
loud
in
his
praises
of
them
persuaded
the
poet
to
bring
them
over
to
england
to
have
them
published
in
a
poem
called
colin
clout
come
home
again
which
spenser
wrote
a
few
years
later
he
tells
in
his
own
poetic
way
of
these
meetings
and
talks
and
of
how
raleigh
persuaded
him
to
go
to
england
there
to
publish
his
poem
in
colin
clout
spenser
calls
both
himself
and
raleigh
shepherds
for
just
as
at
one
time
it
was
the
fashion
to
write
poems
in
the
form
of
a
dream
so
in
spenser
day
it
was
the
fashion
to
write
poems
called
pastorals
in
which
the
authors
made
believe
that
all
their
characters
were
shepherds
and
shepherdesses
one
day
quoth
he
i
sat
as
was
my
trade
under
the
foot
of
mole
that
mountain
hoare
keeping
my
sheep
amongst
the
cooly
shade
of
the
green
alders
by
the
shore
there
a
strange
shepherd
chanst
to
find
me
out
whether
alluréd
by
my
pipe
delight
whose
pleasing
sound
far
about
or
thither
led
by
chance
i
know
not
right
whom
when
i
askéd
from
what
place
he
came
and
how
he
hight
himself
he
did
the
shepherd
of
the
ocean
by
name
and
said
he
came
far
from
the
main
sea
deep
he
sitting
me
beside
in
that
same
shade
provokéd
me
to
play
some
pleasant
fit
and
when
he
heard
the
music
that
i
made
he
found
himself
full
greatly
pleased
at
it
awbeg
spenser
tells
then
how
the
other
shepherd
sang
his
song
was
all
a
lamentable
lay
of
great
unkindness
and
of
usage
hard
of
cynthia
the
lady
of
the
sea
that
from
her
presence
faultless
him
debarred
when
thus
our
pipes
we
both
had
wearied
well
and
each
an
end
of
singing
made
he
gan
to
cast
great
liking
to
my
lore
and
great
disliking
to
my
luckless
lot
that
banished
had
myself
like
wight
forlore
into
that
waste
where
i
was
quite
forgot
the
which
to
leave
henceforth
he
counselled
me
unmeet
for
man
in
whom
was
ought
regardful
and
wend
with
him
his
cynthia
to
see
whose
grace
was
great
and
bounty
most
rewardful
so
what
with
hope
of
good
and
hate
of
ill
he
me
persuaded
forth
with
him
to
fare
queen
elizabeth
received
spenser
kindly
and
was
so
delighted
with
the
faery
queen
that
she
ordered
lord
burleigh
to
pay
the
poet
pounds
a
year
what
grumbled
the
lord
treasurer
it
is
not
in
reason
so
much
for
a
mere
song
then
give
him
said
the
queen
what
is
reason
to
which
he
consented
but
says
an
old
writer
he
was
so
busied
belike
about
matters
of
higher
concernment
that
spenser
received
no
reward
in
the
however
he
did
receive
pounds
a
year
as
much
as
pounds
would
be
now
but
it
did
not
seem
to
spenser
to
be
enough
to
allow
him
to
give
up
his
post
in
ireland
and
live
in
england
so
back
to
ireland
he
went
once
more
with
a
grudge
in
his
heart
against
lord
burleigh
fuller
chapter
xlii
spenser
the
faery
queen
spenser
plan
for
the
faery
queen
was
a
very
great
one
he
meant
to
write
a
poem
in
twelve
books
each
book
containing
the
adventures
of
a
knight
who
was
to
show
forth
one
virtue
and
if
these
were
well
received
he
purposed
to
write
twelve
more
only
the
first
three
books
were
as
yet
published
but
they
made
him
far
more
famous
than
the
shepherd
calendar
had
done
for
never
since
chaucer
had
such
poetry
been
written
in
the
faery
queen
spenser
has
as
he
says
changed
his
oaten
reed
for
trumpets
stern
and
sings
no
longer
now
of
shepherds
and
their
loves
but
of
knights
and
ladies
gentle
deeds
of
fierce
wars
and
faithful
loves
the
first
three
books
tell
the
adventures
of
the
red
cross
knight
george
or
holiness
of
sir
guyon
or
temperance
and
of
the
lady
britomartis
or
chastity
the
whole
poem
is
an
allegory
everywhere
we
are
meant
to
see
a
hidden
meaning
but
sometimes
the
allegory
is
very
confused
and
hard
to
follow
so
at
first
in
any
case
it
is
best
to
enjoy
the
story
and
the
beautiful
poetry
and
not
trouble
about
the
second
meaning
spenser
plunges
us
at
once
into
the
very
middle
of
the
story
he
begins
a
gentle
knight
was
pricking
on
the
plain
yelad
in
mighty
arms
and
silver
shield
wherein
old
dints
of
deep
wounds
did
remain
the
cruel
marks
of
many
a
bloody
field
yet
arms
till
that
time
did
he
never
wield
his
angry
steed
did
chide
his
foaming
bit
as
much
disdaining
to
the
curb
to
yield
full
jolly
knight
he
seem
and
fair
did
sit
as
one
for
knightly
jousts
and
fierce
encounters
fit
but
on
his
breast
a
bloody
cross
he
bore
the
dear
remembrance
of
his
dying
lord
for
whose
sweet
sake
that
glorious
badge
he
wore
and
dead
as
living
ever
him
ador
upon
his
shield
the
like
was
also
scor
and
by
the
side
of
this
knight
rode
a
lovely
lady
upon
a
white
ass
her
dress
too
was
but
over
it
she
wore
a
black
cloak
as
one
that
inly
mourned
and
it
seemed
in
her
heart
some
hidden
care
she
had
so
the
story
begins
but
why
these
two
the
grave
and
gallant
knight
and
the
sad
and
lovely
lady
are
riding
forth
together
we
should
not
know
until
the
middle
of
the
seventh
canto
were
it
not
for
a
letter
which
spenser
wrote
to
raleigh
and
printed
in
the
beginning
of
his
book
in
it
he
tells
us
not
only
who
these
two
are
but
also
his
whole
great
design
he
writes
this
letter
he
says
knowing
how
doubtfully
all
allegories
may
be
construed
and
this
book
of
his
being
a
continued
allegory
or
dark
conceit
he
thought
it
good
to
explain
having
told
how
he
means
to
write
of
knights
who
shall
represent
four
virtues
he
goes
on
to
tell
us
that
the
faery
queen
kept
her
yearly
feast
twelve
days
upon
which
twelve
days
the
occasions
of
the
first
twelve
adventures
happened
which
being
undertaken
by
twelve
knights
are
told
of
in
these
twelve
books
the
first
was
this
at
the
beginning
of
the
feast
a
tall
clownish
young
man
knelt
before
the
queen
of
the
fairies
asking
as
a
boon
that
to
him
might
be
given
the
first
adventure
that
might
befall
that
being
granted
he
rested
him
on
the
floor
unfit
through
his
rusticity
for
a
better
place
soon
after
entered
a
fair
lady
in
mourning
weeds
riding
on
a
white
ass
with
a
dwarf
behind
her
leading
a
warlike
steed
that
bore
the
arms
of
a
knight
and
his
spear
in
the
dwarf
hand
she
falling
before
the
queen
of
fairies
complained
that
her
father
and
mother
an
ancient
king
and
queen
had
been
by
a
huge
dragon
many
years
shut
up
in
a
brasen
castle
who
thence
suffered
them
not
to
issue
and
therefore
she
prayed
the
fairy
queen
to
give
her
a
knight
who
would
slay
the
dragon
then
the
clownish
person
started
up
and
demanded
the
adventure
the
queen
was
astonished
the
maid
unwilling
yet
he
begged
so
hard
that
the
queen
consented
the
lady
however
told
him
that
unless
the
armor
she
had
brought
would
serve
him
he
could
not
succeed
but
when
he
put
the
armor
on
he
seemed
the
goodliest
man
in
all
that
company
and
was
well
liked
of
that
lady
and
eftsoons
taking
on
him
knighthood
and
mounting
on
that
strange
courser
he
went
forth
with
her
on
that
adventure
where
beginneth
the
first
book
viz
gentle
knight
was
pricking
on
the
plain
etc
the
story
goes
on
to
tell
how
the
knight
who
is
the
red
cross
knight
george
and
the
lady
who
is
called
una
rode
on
followed
by
the
dwarf
at
length
in
the
wide
forest
they
lost
their
way
and
came
upon
the
lair
of
a
terrible
fly
fly
quoth
then
the
fearful
dwarf
this
is
no
place
for
living
men
but
full
of
fire
and
greedy
hardiment
the
youthful
knight
could
not
for
ought
be
stayed
but
forth
unto
the
darksome
hole
he
went
and
lookéd
in
his
glistering
armour
made
a
little
glooming
light
much
like
a
shade
by
which
he
saw
the
ugly
monster
plain
half
like
a
serpent
horribly
displayed
but
half
did
woman
shape
retain
most
loathsome
filthy
foul
and
full
of
vile
disdain
there
was
a
fearful
fight
between
the
knight
and
the
dragon
whose
name
is
error
but
at
length
the
knight
conquered
the
terrible
beast
lay
dead
reft
of
her
baleful
head
and
the
knight
mounting
upon
his
charger
once
more
rode
onwards
with
his
lady
at
length
they
chanced
to
meet
upon
the
way
an
aged
sire
in
long
black
weeds
yelad
his
feet
all
bare
his
beard
all
hoary
grey
and
by
his
belt
his
book
he
hanging
had
sober
he
seemed
and
very
sagely
sad
and
to
the
ground
his
eyes
were
lowly
bent
simple
in
show
and
void
of
malice
bad
and
all
the
way
he
prayéd
as
he
went
and
often
knocked
his
breast
as
one
that
did
repent
the
knight
and
this
aged
man
greeted
each
other
fair
and
courteously
and
as
evening
was
now
fallen
the
godly
father
bade
the
travelers
come
to
his
hermitage
for
the
night
this
the
knight
and
lady
gladly
did
and
soon
were
peacefully
sleeping
beneath
the
humble
roof
but
the
seeming
godly
father
was
a
wicked
magician
while
his
guests
slept
he
wove
evil
spells
about
them
and
calling
a
wicked
dream
he
bade
it
sit
at
the
knight
head
and
whisper
lies
to
him
this
the
wicked
dream
did
till
that
it
made
the
knight
believe
his
lady
to
be
bad
and
false
then
early
in
the
morning
the
red
cross
knight
rose
and
believing
his
lady
to
be
unworthy
he
rode
sadly
away
leaving
her
alone
soon
as
he
rode
along
he
met
a
saracen
whose
name
was
sansfoy
or
without
faith
full
large
of
limb
and
every
joint
he
was
and
cared
not
for
god
or
man
a
point
he
had
a
fair
companion
of
his
way
a
goodly
lady
clad
in
scarlet
red
purfled
with
gold
and
pearl
of
rich
assay
and
like
a
persian
mitre
on
her
head
she
wore
with
crowns
and
riches
garnishéd
the
which
her
lavish
lovers
to
her
gave
her
wanton
palfrey
all
was
overspread
with
tinsell
trappings
woven
like
a
wave
whose
bridle
rang
with
golden
bells
and
bosses
brave
the
red
cross
knight
fought
and
conquered
sansfoy
then
he
rode
onward
with
the
dead
giant
companion
the
lady
duessa
whom
he
believed
to
be
good
because
he
was
too
simple
and
too
true
to
know
her
wicked
meanwhile
una
forsaken
and
woeful
wandered
far
and
wide
seeking
her
lost
knight
but
nowhere
could
she
hear
tidings
of
him
at
length
one
day
weary
of
her
quest
she
got
off
her
ass
and
lay
down
to
rest
in
the
thick
wood
where
her
angel
face
made
a
sunshine
in
the
shady
place
then
out
of
the
thickest
of
the
wood
a
ramping
lion
rushed
suddenly
it
fortuned
out
of
the
thickest
wood
a
ramping
lion
rushed
suddenly
hunting
full
greedy
after
savage
blood
soon
as
the
royal
virgin
he
did
spy
with
gaping
mouth
at
her
ran
greedily
to
have
at
once
devoured
her
tender
corse
but
as
he
came
near
the
sleeping
lady
the
lion
rage
suddenly
melted
instead
of
killing
una
he
licked
her
weary
feet
and
white
hands
with
fawning
tongue
from
being
her
enemy
he
became
her
guardian
and
so
for
many
a
day
the
lion
stayed
with
una
guarding
her
from
all
harm
but
in
her
wanderings
she
at
length
met
with
sansloy
the
brother
of
sansfoy
who
killed
the
lion
and
carried
una
off
into
the
darksome
wood
but
here
in
her
direst
need
una
found
new
friends
in
a
troupe
of
fauns
and
satyrs
who
were
playing
in
the
forest
whom
when
the
raging
saracen
espied
a
rude
misshapen
monstrous
rabblement
whose
like
he
never
saw
he
durst
not
bide
but
got
his
ready
steed
and
fast
away
gan
ride
then
the
fauns
and
satyrs
gathered
round
the
lady
wondering
at
her
beauty
pitying
her
fair
blubbered
face
but
una
shook
with
fear
these
terrible
shapes
half
goat
half
human
struck
her
dumb
with
horror
ne
word
to
peak
ne
joint
to
move
she
had
the
savage
nation
feel
her
secret
smart
and
read
her
sorrow
in
her
sad
their
frowning
foreheads
with
rough
horns
yelad
and
rustic
horror
all
aside
do
lay
and
gently
grinning
shew
a
semblance
glad
to
comfort
her
and
feat
to
put
away
they
kneel
upon
the
ground
they
kiss
her
feet
and
at
last
sure
that
they
mean
her
no
harm
una
rises
and
goes
with
them
rejoicing
singing
songs
honoring
her
as
their
queen
waving
branches
scattering
flowers
beneath
her
feet
they
lead
her
to
their
chief
sylvanus
he
too
receives
her
kindly
and
in
the
wood
she
lives
with
these
wild
creatures
until
there
she
finds
a
new
knight
named
satyrane
with
whom
she
once
more
sets
forth
to
seek
the
red
cross
knight
meanwhile
duessa
had
led
the
red
cross
knight
to
the
house
of
pride
a
stately
palace
built
of
squaréd
brick
which
cunningly
was
without
mortar
laid
whose
walls
were
high
but
nothing
strong
nor
thick
and
golden
foil
all
over
them
displayed
that
purest
sky
with
brightness
they
dismayed
high
lifted
up
were
many
lofty
towers
and
goodly
galleries
far
overlaid
full
of
fair
windows
and
delightful
bowers
and
on
the
top
a
dial
told
the
timely
hours
it
was
a
goodly
heap
for
to
behold
and
spake
the
praises
of
the
workman
wit
but
full
great
pity
that
so
fair
a
mould
did
on
so
weak
foundation
ever
sit
for
on
a
sandy
hill
that
still
did
flit
and
fall
away
it
mounted
was
full
high
and
every
breath
of
heaven
shakéd
it
and
all
the
hinder
parts
that
few
could
spy
were
ruinous
and
old
but
painted
cunningly
here
the
knight
met
sansjoy
the
third
of
the
saracen
brothers
and
another
fearful
fight
took
place
the
saracen
was
stout
and
wondrous
strong
and
heapéd
blows
like
iron
hammers
great
for
after
blood
and
vengeance
he
did
long
the
knight
was
fierce
and
full
of
youthly
heat
and
doubled
strokes
like
dreaded
thunder
threat
for
all
for
praise
and
honour
he
did
fight
both
striken
strike
and
beaten
both
do
beat
that
from
their
shields
forth
flyeth
fiery
light
and
helmets
hewen
deep
show
marks
of
either
might
at
last
a
charmed
cloud
hid
the
saracen
from
the
knight
sight
so
the
fight
ended
and
the
knight
sorely
wounded
was
laid
in
sumptuous
bed
where
many
skilful
leeches
him
abide
but
as
he
lay
there
weak
and
ill
the
dwarf
came
to
warn
him
for
he
had
spied
where
in
a
dungeon
deep
huge
numbers
lay
of
caitiff
wretched
thralls
that
wailéd
night
and
day
whose
case
when
as
the
careful
dwarf
had
told
and
made
ensample
of
their
mournful
sight
unto
his
master
he
no
longer
would
there
dwell
in
peril
of
like
painful
plight
but
early
rose
and
ere
that
dawning
light
discovered
had
the
world
to
heaven
wide
he
by
a
privy
postern
took
his
flight
that
of
no
envious
eyes
he
might
be
spied
for
doubtless
death
ensued
if
any
him
descried
when
the
false
duessa
discovered
that
the
red
cross
knight
had
fled
she
followed
him
and
found
him
resting
beside
a
fountain
not
knowing
that
the
water
was
enchanted
he
drank
of
it
and
at
once
all
his
manly
strength
ebbed
away
and
he
became
faint
and
feeble
then
when
he
was
too
weak
to
hold
a
sword
or
spear
he
saw
a
fearful
sight
with
sturdy
steps
came
stalking
in
his
sight
an
hideous
giant
horrible
and
high
that
with
his
tallness
seemed
to
threat
the
sky
the
ground
eke
groanéd
under
him
for
dread
his
living
like
saw
never
living
eye
nor
durst
behold
his
stature
did
exceed
the
height
of
three
the
tallest
sons
of
mortal
seed
towards
the
knight
so
weak
that
he
could
scarcely
hold
his
sword
this
giant
came
stalking
weak
as
he
was
the
knight
made
ready
to
fight
but
the
giant
strake
so
mainly
merciless
that
could
have
overthrown
a
stony
tower
and
were
not
heavenly
grace
that
did
him
bless
he
had
been
powdered
all
as
thin
as
flour
as
the
giant
struck
at
him
the
knight
leapt
aside
and
the
blow
fell
harmless
but
so
mighty
was
it
that
the
wind
of
it
threw
him
to
the
ground
where
he
lay
senseless
and
ere
he
woke
out
of
his
swoon
the
giant
took
him
up
and
him
to
his
castle
brought
with
hasty
force
and
in
a
dungeon
deep
him
threw
without
remorse
duessa
then
became
the
giant
lady
he
gave
her
gold
and
purple
pall
to
wear
and
set
a
triple
crown
upon
her
head
for
steed
he
gave
her
a
fearsome
dragon
with
fiery
eyes
and
seven
heads
so
that
all
who
saw
her
went
in
dread
and
awe
the
dwarf
seeing
his
master
thus
overthrown
and
made
prisoner
gathered
his
armor
and
set
forth
to
tell
his
evil
tidings
and
find
help
he
had
not
gone
far
before
he
met
the
lady
una
to
her
he
told
his
sad
news
and
she
with
grief
in
her
heart
turned
with
him
to
find
the
dark
dungeon
in
which
her
knight
lay
on
her
way
she
met
another
knight
this
was
prince
arthur
and
he
learning
of
her
sorrow
went
with
her
promising
aid
guided
by
the
dwarf
they
reached
the
castle
of
the
giant
and
here
a
fearful
fight
took
place
in
which
prince
arthur
conquered
duessa
dragon
and
killed
the
giant
then
he
entered
the
castle
where
living
creature
none
he
did
espy
then
gan
he
loudly
through
the
house
to
call
but
no
man
cared
to
answer
to
his
cry
there
reigned
a
solemn
silence
over
all
nor
voice
was
heard
nor
wight
was
seen
in
bower
or
hall
at
last
with
creeping
crooked
pace
forth
came
an
old
old
man
with
beard
as
white
as
snow
that
on
a
staff
his
feeble
steps
did
frame
and
guide
his
weary
gate
both
to
and
fro
for
his
eyesight
him
failéd
long
ago
and
on
his
arm
a
bunch
of
keys
he
bore
the
which
unuséd
rust
did
overgrow
those
were
the
keys
of
every
inner
door
but
he
could
not
them
use
but
kept
them
still
in
store
and
what
was
strange
and
terrible
about
this
old
man
was
that
his
head
was
twisted
upon
his
shoulders
so
that
although
he
walked
towards
the
knight
his
face
looked
backward
seeing
his
gray
hairs
and
venerable
look
prince
arthur
asked
him
gently
where
all
the
folk
of
the
castle
were
i
can
not
tell
answered
the
old
man
and
to
every
question
he
replied
i
can
not
tell
until
the
knight
impatient
of
delay
seized
the
keys
from
his
arm
door
after
door
the
prince
arthur
opened
seeing
many
strange
sad
sights
but
nowhere
could
he
find
the
captive
knight
at
last
he
came
unto
an
iron
door
that
fast
was
locked
but
key
found
not
at
all
amongst
that
bunch
to
open
it
withal
but
there
was
a
little
grating
in
the
door
through
which
prince
arthur
called
a
hollow
dreary
murmuring
voice
replied
it
was
the
voice
of
the
red
cross
knight
which
when
the
champion
heard
with
furious
force
and
indignation
fell
he
rent
that
iron
door
and
entered
in
once
more
the
red
cross
knight
was
free
and
reunited
to
his
lady
while
the
false
duessa
was
unmasked
and
shown
to
be
a
bad
old
witch
who
fled
away
to
the
wasteful
wilderness
apace
but
the
red
cross
knight
was
still
so
weak
and
feeble
that
despair
almost
persuaded
him
to
kill
himself
seeing
this
una
led
him
to
the
house
of
holiness
where
he
stayed
until
once
more
he
was
strong
and
well
here
he
learned
that
he
was
george
thou
he
is
told
shalt
be
a
saint
and
thine
own
nation
friend
and
patron
thou
george
shalt
calléd
be
george
of
merry
england
the
sign
of
victory
once
more
strong
of
arm
full
of
new
courage
the
knight
set
forth
with
una
and
soon
they
reached
her
home
where
the
dreadful
dragon
raged
here
the
most
fierce
fight
of
all
takes
place
three
days
it
is
renewed
and
on
the
third
day
the
dragon
is
conquered
so
down
he
fell
and
forth
his
life
did
breathe
that
vanished
into
smoke
and
clouds
swift
so
down
he
fell
that
th
earth
him
underneath
did
groan
as
feeble
so
great
load
to
lift
so
down
he
fell
as
an
huge
rocky
clift
whose
false
foundation
waves
have
washed
away
with
dreadful
poise
is
from
the
mainland
rift
and
rolling
down
great
neptune
doth
dismay
so
down
he
fell
and
like
an
heapéd
mountain
lay
thus
all
ends
happily
the
aged
king
and
queen
are
rescued
from
the
brazen
tower
in
which
the
dragon
had
imprisoned
them
and
una
and
the
knight
are
married
that
is
the
story
of
the
first
book
of
the
faery
queen
in
it
spenser
has
made
great
use
of
the
legend
of
george
and
the
dragon
the
red
cross
of
his
knight
the
dear
remembrance
of
his
dying
lord
was
in
those
days
the
flag
of
england
and
is
still
the
red
cross
of
our
union
jack
and
besides
the
allegory
the
poem
has
something
of
history
in
it
the
great
people
of
spenser
day
play
their
parts
there
thus
duessa
sad
to
say
is
meant
to
be
the
fair
unhappy
queen
of
scots
the
wicked
magician
is
the
pope
and
so
on
but
we
need
scarcely
trouble
about
all
that
i
repeat
that
meantime
it
is
enough
for
you
to
enjoy
the
story
and
the
poetry
chapter
xliii
spenser
his
last
days
there
are
so
many
books
now
published
which
tell
the
stories
of
the
faery
queen
and
tell
them
well
that
you
may
think
i
hardly
need
have
told
one
here
but
few
of
these
books
give
the
own
words
and
i
have
told
the
story
here
giving
quotations
from
the
poem
in
the
hope
that
you
will
read
them
and
learn
from
them
to
love
spenser
own
words
i
hope
that
long
after
you
have
forgotten
my
words
you
will
remember
spenser
that
they
will
remain
in
your
mind
as
glowing
and
make
you
anxious
to
read
more
of
the
poem
from
which
they
are
taken
spenser
has
been
called
the
poet
poet
he
might
also
be
called
the
painter
poet
for
on
every
page
almost
we
find
a
picture
rich
in
color
rich
in
detail
each
person
as
he
comes
upon
the
scene
is
described
for
us
so
that
we
may
see
him
with
our
mind
eye
the
whole
poem
blazes
with
color
it
glows
and
gleams
with
the
glamor
of
fairyland
spenser
more
than
any
other
poet
has
the
old
celtic
love
of
beauty
yet
so
far
as
we
know
there
was
in
him
no
drop
of
celtic
blood
he
loved
neither
the
irishman
nor
ireland
to
him
his
life
there
was
an
exile
yet
perhaps
even
in
spite
of
himself
he
breathed
in
the
land
of
fairies
and
of
little
people
something
of
their
magic
his
fingers
unwittingly
perhaps
touched
the
golden
and
ivory
gate
so
that
he
entered
in
and
saw
lamb
that
it
is
a
fairyland
and
no
real
world
which
spenser
opens
to
us
is
the
great
difference
between
chaucer
and
him
chaucer
gives
us
real
men
and
women
who
love
and
hate
who
sin
and
sorrow
he
is
humorous
he
is
coarse
and
he
is
real
spenser
has
humor
too
but
we
seldom
see
him
smile
there
are
we
may
be
glad
few
coarse
lines
in
spenser
but
he
is
artificial
he
took
the
tone
of
his
time
the
tone
of
pretense
it
was
the
fashion
to
yet
underneath
all
the
men
were
still
men
not
wholly
good
nor
wholly
bad
but
underneath
the
brilliant
trappings
of
spenser
knights
and
ladies
shepherds
and
shepherdesses
there
seldom
beats
a
human
heart
he
takes
us
to
dreamland
and
when
we
lay
down
the
book
we
wake
up
to
real
life
beauty
first
and
last
is
what
holds
us
in
spenser
of
description
beauty
of
thought
beauty
of
sound
as
it
has
been
said
thing
of
beauty
is
a
joy
forever
and
that
is
the
secret
of
the
enduring
life
of
the
faery
queen
history
of
english
poetry
spenser
invented
for
himself
a
new
stanza
of
nine
lines
and
made
it
famous
so
that
we
call
it
after
him
the
spenserian
stanza
it
was
like
chaucer
stanza
of
seven
lines
called
the
rhyme
royal
with
two
lines
more
added
spenser
admired
chaucer
above
all
poets
he
called
him
the
well
of
english
undefiled
and
after
many
hundred
years
we
still
feel
the
truth
of
the
description
he
uses
many
of
words
which
even
then
had
grown
and
were
little
used
so
much
is
this
so
that
a
glossary
written
by
a
friend
of
spenser
in
which
old
words
were
explained
was
published
with
the
shepherd
calendar
but
whether
old
or
new
spenser
power
of
using
words
and
of
weaving
them
together
was
wonderful
queen
book
vi
canto
ii
he
weaves
his
wonderful
words
in
such
wonderful
fashion
that
they
sound
like
what
he
describes
is
there
anything
more
drowsy
than
his
description
of
the
abode
of
sleep
and
more
to
lull
him
in
his
slumber
soft
a
trickling
stream
from
high
rock
tumbling
down
and
ever
drizzling
rain
upon
the
loft
mix
with
a
murmuring
wind
much
like
the
sound
of
swarming
bees
did
cast
him
in
a
swound
no
other
noise
nor
peoples
troublous
cries
as
still
are
wont
t
annoy
the
walled
town
might
there
be
heard
but
careless
quiet
lies
wrapt
in
eternal
silence
far
from
enemies
so
all
through
the
poem
we
are
enchanted
or
lulled
by
the
glamor
of
words
the
faery
queen
made
spenser
as
a
poet
famous
but
as
we
know
it
did
not
bring
him
enough
to
live
on
in
england
it
did
not
bring
him
the
fame
he
sought
nor
make
him
great
among
the
statesmen
of
the
land
among
the
courtiers
of
queen
elizabeth
he
counted
for
little
so
he
returned
to
ireland
a
disappointed
man
it
was
now
he
wrote
colin
clout
come
home
again
from
which
i
have
already
given
you
some
quotations
he
published
also
another
book
of
poems
and
then
he
fell
in
love
he
forgot
his
beautiful
rosalind
who
had
been
so
and
gave
his
love
to
another
lady
who
in
her
turn
loved
him
and
to
whom
he
was
happily
married
this
lady
too
he
made
famous
in
his
verse
as
the
fashion
was
he
wrote
to
her
a
series
of
sonnets
in
one
of
which
we
learn
that
her
name
was
elizabeth
he
writes
to
the
three
elizabeths
his
mother
his
queen
and
the
third
my
love
my
life
last
ornament
by
whom
my
spirit
out
of
dust
was
raised
but
more
famous
still
than
the
sonnets
is
the
epithalamion
or
wedding
hymn
which
he
wrote
in
his
lady
honor
and
which
ever
since
has
been
looked
on
as
the
most
glorious
in
the
english
language
so
full
is
it
of
exultant
worshipful
happiness
it
was
now
too
that
spenser
wrote
astrophel
a
sadly
beautiful
dirge
for
the
death
of
his
friend
and
sir
philip
sidney
he
gave
his
verses
as
fittest
flowers
to
deck
his
mournful
hearse
just
before
his
marriage
spenser
finished
three
more
books
of
the
faery
queen
and
the
following
year
he
took
them
to
london
to
publish
them
the
three
books
were
on
friendship
on
justice
and
on
courtesy
they
were
received
as
joyfully
as
the
first
three
the
poet
remained
for
nearly
a
year
in
london
still
writing
busily
then
he
returned
to
ireland
there
he
passed
a
few
more
years
and
then
came
the
end
ireland
which
had
always
been
unquiet
always
restless
under
the
oppressive
hand
of
england
now
broke
out
into
wild
rebellion
the
maddened
irish
had
no
love
or
respect
for
the
english
poet
kilcolman
castle
was
sacked
and
burned
and
spenser
fled
with
his
wife
and
children
to
cork
homeless
and
wellnigh
ruined
a
little
later
spenser
himself
went
on
to
london
hoping
perhaps
to
better
his
fortunes
and
there
in
a
westminster
inn
disappointed
ill
shattered
in
hopes
and
health
he
lay
down
to
die
as
men
count
years
he
was
still
young
for
he
was
only
seven
he
had
dreamed
that
he
had
still
time
before
him
to
make
life
a
success
for
as
men
counted
success
in
those
days
spenser
was
a
failure
he
had
failed
to
make
a
name
among
the
statesmen
of
the
age
he
failed
to
make
a
fortune
he
lived
poor
and
he
died
poor
as
a
poet
he
was
a
sublime
success
he
dedicated
the
faery
queen
to
elizabeth
to
live
with
the
eternity
of
her
fame
and
it
is
not
too
much
to
believe
that
even
should
the
deeds
of
elizabeth
be
forgotten
the
fame
of
spenser
will
endure
and
the
poets
of
spenser
own
day
knew
that
in
him
they
had
lost
a
master
and
they
mourned
for
him
as
such
they
buried
him
in
westminster
not
far
from
chaucer
his
bier
was
carried
by
poets
who
as
they
stood
beside
his
grave
threw
into
it
poems
in
which
they
told
of
his
glory
and
their
own
grief
and
so
they
left
the
prince
of
poets
in
his
tyme
whose
divine
spirit
needs
no
other
witnesse
than
the

which
he

chapter
xliv
about
the
first
theaters
in
the
beginnings
of
our
literature
there
were
two
men
who
we
might
say
were
the
these
were
the
gay
minstrel
abroad
in
the
world
singing
in
hall
and
and
the
patient
monk
at
work
in
cell
or
cloister
and
as
year
by
year
our
literature
grew
strengthened
and
broadened
we
might
say
it
flowed
on
in
two
streams
it
flowed
in
two
streams
which
were
ever
joining
mingling
separating
again
for
the
monk
and
the
minstrel
spoke
to
man
each
in
his
own
way
the
monk
made
his
appeal
to
the
eye
as
with
patient
care
he
copied
painted
and
made
his
manuscript
beautiful
with
gold
and
colors
the
minstrel
made
his
appeal
to
the
ear
with
music
and
with
song
then
after
a
time
the
streams
seemed
to
join
and
the
monk
when
he
played
the
seemed
to
be
taking
the
minstrel
part
here
was
an
appeal
to
both
the
eye
and
ear
instead
of
illuminating
the
silent
parchment
he
made
living
pictures
illustrate
spoken
words
then
followed
a
time
when
the
streams
once
more
divided
and
church
and
stage
parted
the
strolling
players
and
the
trade
guilds
took
the
place
both
of
the
minstrel
and
of
the
monkish
actors
the
monk
went
back
once
more
to
his
quiet
cell
and
the
minstrel
gradually
disappeared
so
year
after
year
went
on
by
slow
degrees
times
changed
and
our
literature
changed
with
the
times
but
looking
backward
we
can
see
that
the
poet
is
the
development
of
the
minstrel
the
prose
writer
the
development
of
the
monkish
chronicler
and
copyist
prose
at
first
was
only
used
for
grave
matters
for
history
for
religious
works
for
dry
treatises
which
were
hardly
literature
which
were
not
meant
for
enjoyment
but
only
for
use
and
for
teaching
but
by
degrees
people
began
to
use
prose
for
for
enjoyment
more
and
more
prose
began
to
be
written
for
amusement
until
at
last
it
has
quite
taken
the
place
of
poetry
nowadays
many
people
are
not
at
all
fond
of
poetry
they
are
rather
apt
to
think
that
a
poetry
book
is
but
dull
reading
and
they
much
prefer
plain
prose
it
may
amuse
those
who
feel
like
that
to
remember
that
hundreds
of
years
ago
it
was
just
the
other
way
round
then
it
was
prose
that
was
considered
dull
hence
we
have
the
word
prosy
all
poetry
was
at
first
written
to
be
sung
sung
too
perhaps
with
some
gesture
so
that
the
hearers
might
the
better
understand
the
story
then
by
degrees
poets
got
further
and
further
away
from
that
until
poets
like
spenser
wrote
with
no
such
idea
but
while
poets
like
spenser
wrote
their
stories
to
be
read
another
class
of
poets
was
growing
up
who
intended
their
poems
to
be
spoken
and
acted
these
were
the
dramatists
so
you
see
that
the
minstrel
stream
divided
into
two
there
was
now
the
poet
who
wrote
his
poems
to
be
read
in
quiet
and
the
poet
who
wrote
his
if
not
to
be
sung
at
least
to
be
spoken
aloud
but
there
had
been
as
we
have
seen
a
time
when
the
minstrel
and
the
monkish
stream
had
touched
a
time
when
the
monk
using
the
minstrel
art
had
taught
the
people
through
ear
and
eye
together
for
the
idea
of
the
miracle
and
morality
plays
was
you
remember
to
teach
so
long
after
the
monks
had
ceased
to
act
those
who
wrote
poems
to
be
acted
felt
that
they
must
teach
something
thus
after
the
miracle
plays
came
the
moralities
which
sometimes
were
very
long
and
dull
they
were
followed
by
interludes
which
were
much
the
same
as
moralities
but
were
shorter
and
as
their
name
shows
were
meant
to
come
in
the
middle
of
something
else
for
the
word
comes
from
two
latin
words
inter
between
and
ludus
a
play
an
interlude
may
have
been
first
used
perhaps
as
a
kind
of
break
in
a
long
feast
the
miracle
plays
had
only
been
acted
once
a
year
first
by
the
monks
and
later
by
the
trade
guilds
but
the
taste
for
plays
grew
and
soon
bands
of
players
strolled
about
the
country
acting
in
towns
and
villages
these
strolling
players
often
made
a
good
deal
of
money
but
though
the
people
crowded
willingly
to
see
and
hear
the
magistrates
did
not
love
these
players
and
they
were
looked
upon
as
little
better
than
rogues
and
vagabonds
then
it
became
the
fashion
for
great
lords
to
have
their
own
company
of
players
and
they
when
their
masters
did
not
need
them
also
traveled
about
to
the
surrounding
villages
acting
wherever
they
went
this
taste
for
acting
grew
strong
in
the
people
of
england
and
if
in
the
life
of
the
middle
ages
there
was
always
room
for
in
the
life
of
tudor
england
there
was
always
room
for
acting
and
shows
these
shows
were
called
by
various
names
pageants
masques
interludes
mummings
or
disguisings
and
on
every
great
or
little
occasion
there
was
sure
to
be
something
of
the
sort
if
the
king
or
queen
went
on
a
journey
he
or
she
was
entertained
by
pageants
on
the
way
if
a
royal
visitor
came
to
the
court
of
england
there
were
pageants
in
his
honor
a
birthday
a
christening
a
wedding
or
a
victory
would
all
be
celebrated
by
pageants
and
in
these
plays
people
of
all
classes
took
part
acted
university
students
acted
the
learned
lawyers
or
inns
of
court
acted
great
lords
and
ladies
acted
and
even
at
times
the
king
and
queen
themselves
took
part
and
although
many
of
these
shows
especially
the
pageants
were
merely
shows
without
any
words
many
on
the
other
hand
had
words
thus
with
so
much
acting
and
love
of
acting
it
was
not
wonderful
that
a
crowd
of
dramatists
sprang
up
then
too
plays
began
to
be
divided
into
tragedies
and
comedies
a
tragedy
is
a
play
which
shows
the
sad
side
of
life
and
which
has
a
mournful
ending
the
word
really
means
a
and
comes
from
two
greek
words
tragos
a
goat
and
ode
a
song
it
was
so
called
either
because
the
oldest
tragedies
were
acted
while
a
goat
was
sacrificed
or
because
the
actors
themselves
wore
clothes
made
of
a
comedy
is
a
play
which
shows
the
merry
side
of
life
and
has
a
happy
ending
this
word
too
comes
from
two
greek
words
komos
a
revel
and
ode
a
song
the
greek
word
for
village
is
also
komo
so
a
comedy
may
at
first
have
meant
a
village
revel
or
a
tragedy
it
has
been
said
is
poetry
in
its
deepest
earnest
comedy
is
poetry
in
unlimited
jest
but
the
old
moralities
were
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
neither
tragedy
nor
comedy
they
did
not
touch
life
keenly
enough
to
awaken
horror
or
pain
they
were
often
sad
but
not
with
that
sadness
which
we
have
come
to
call
tragic
they
were
often
indeed
merely
dull
and
although
there
was
always
a
funny
character
to
make
laughter
it
was
by
no
means
unlimited
jest
the
interludes
came
next
after
the
moralities
with
a
little
more
human
interest
and
a
little
more
fun
and
from
them
it
was
easy
to
pass
to
real
comedies
a
play
named
ralph
roister
doister
is
generally
looked
upon
as
the
first
real
english
comedy
it
was
written
by
nicholas
udall
headmaster
first
of
eton
and
then
of
westminster
for
the
boys
of
one
or
other
school
it
was
probably
for
those
of
westminster
that
it
was
written
and
may
have
been
acted
about
the
hero
if
one
may
call
him
so
who
gives
his
name
to
the
play
is
a
vain
silly
swaggerer
he
thinks
every
woman
who
sees
him
is
in
love
with
him
so
he
makes
up
his
mind
to
marry
a
rich
and
beautiful
widow
named
christian
custance
not
being
a
very
good
scholar
ralph
gets
some
one
else
to
write
a
for
him
but
when
he
copies
it
he
puts
all
the
stops
in
the
wrong
places
which
makes
the
sense
quite
different
from
what
he
had
intended
and
instead
of
being
full
of
pretty
things
the
letter
is
full
of
insults
dame
custance
will
have
nothing
to
say
to
such
a
stupid
lover
i
will
not
be
served
with
a
fool
in
no
wise
when
i
choose
a
husband
i
hope
to
take
a
man
she
says
in
revenge
for
her
scorn
ralph
roister
doister
threatens
to
burn
the
dame
house
down
and
sets
off
to
attack
it
with
his
servants
the
widow
however
meets
him
with
her
handmaidens
there
is
a
free
fight
which
no
doubt
the
schoolboy
actors
enjoyed
but
the
widow
gets
the
best
of
it
and
ralph
is
driven
off
our
first
real
tragedy
was
not
written
until
ten
years
after
our
first
comedy
this
first
tragedy
was
written
by
thomas
norton
and
thomas
sackville
earl
of
dorset
it
was
acted
by
the
gentlemen
of
the
inner
temple
before
the
queen
most
excellent
majestie
in
her
highness
court
of
whitehall
the
day
of
january
chaucer
tells
us
that
a
tragedy
is
a
story
of
him
that
stood
in
great
prosperitie
and
is
yfallen
out
of
high
degree
into
miserie
and
endeth
wretchedly
to
the
monk
tale
canterbury
tales
so
our
early
tragedies
were
all
taken
from
sad
stories
in
the
old
chronicle
histories
and
this
first
tragedy
written
by
norton
and
sackville
is
called
gorboduc
and
is
founded
upon
the
legend
of
gorboduc
king
of
britain
the
story
is
told
though
not
quite
in
the
same
way
by
geoffrey
of
monmouth
our
old
friend
by
matthew
of
westminster
and
by
others
of
the
old
chroniclers
for
in
writing
a
poem
or
play
it
is
not
necessary
to
keep
strictly
to
history
as
sir
philip
sidney
spenser
friend
says
do
they
not
know
that
a
tragedy
is
tied
to
the
laws
of
poesie
and
not
of
history
not
bound
to
follow
the
story
but
having
liberty
either
to
fain
a
quite
new
matter
or
to
frame
the
history
to
the
most
tragical
convenience
apologie
for
poetrie
the
story
goes
that
gorboduc
king
of
britain
divided
his
realm
during
his
lifetime
between
his
sons
ferrex
and
porrex
but
the
brothers
quarreled
and
the
younger
killed
the
elder
the
mother
who
loved
her
eldest
son
most
then
killed
the
younger
in
revenge
next
the
people
angry
at
such
cruelty
rose
in
rebellion
and
killed
both
father
and
mother
the
nobles
then
gathered
and
defeated
the
rebels
and
lastly
for
want
of
an
heir
to
the
throne
they
fell
to
civil
war
and
the
land
for
a
long
time
was
desolate
and
miserable
in
the
play
none
of
these
fearful
murders
happen
on
the
stage
they
are
only
reported
by
messengers
there
is
also
a
chorus
of
old
sage
men
of
britain
who
at
the
end
of
each
act
chant
of
what
has
happened
when
you
come
to
read
greek
plays
you
will
see
that
this
is
more
like
greek
than
english
tragedy
and
it
thus
shows
the
influence
of
the
new
learning
upon
our
literature
but
on
the
other
hand
in
a
greek
drama
there
was
never
more
than
one
scene
and
all
the
action
was
supposed
to
take
place
on
one
day
this
was
called
preserving
the
unities
of
time
and
place
and
no
greek
drama
which
did
not
observe
them
would
have
been
thought
good
in
gorboduc
there
are
several
scenes
and
the
action
although
we
are
not
told
how
long
must
last
over
several
months
at
least
so
that
although
gorboduc
owed
something
to
the
new
learning
which
had
made
men
study
greek
it
owed
as
much
to
the
old
english
miracle
plays
later
on
when
you
come
to
read
more
about
the
history
of
our
drama
you
will
learn
a
great
deal
about
what
we
owe
to
the
greeks
but
here
i
will
not
trouble
you
with
it
you
remember
that
in
the
morality
plays
there
was
no
scenery
and
still
although
in
the
new
plays
which
were
now
being
written
the
scene
was
supposed
to
change
from
place
to
place
there
was
no
attempt
to
make
the
stage
look
like
these
places
the
stage
was
merely
a
plain
platform
and
when
the
scene
changed
a
board
was
hung
up
with
this
is
a
palace
or
this
is
a
street
and
the
imagination
of
the
audience
had
to
do
the
rest
that
some
people
felt
the
absurdity
of
this
we
learn
from
a
book
by
sir
philip
sidney
in
it
he
says
you
shall
have
asia
of
the
one
side
and
affrick
of
the
other
and
so
many
other
under
kingdoms
that
the
player
when
he
cometh
in
must
ever
begin
with
telling
where
he
is
or
else
the
tale
will
not
be
conceived
now
you
shall
have
three
ladies
walk
to
gather
flowers
and
then
we
must
believe
the
stage
to
be
a
garden
by
and
by
we
hear
news
of
shipwreck
in
the
same
place
and
then
we
are
to
blame
if
we
accept
it
not
for
a
rock
upon
the
back
of
that
comes
out
a
hideous
monster
with
fire
and
smoke
and
then
the
miserable
beholders
are
bound
to
take
it
for
a
cave
while
in
the
meantime
two
armies
fly
in
represented
with
four
swords
and
bucklers
and
then
what
hard
heart
will
not
receive
it
for
a
pitched
field
apologie
for
poetrie
published
if
the
actors
of
the
elizabethan
time
had
no
scenery
they
made
up
for
the
lack
of
it
by
splendid
and
gorgeous
dressing
but
it
was
the
dressing
of
the
day
the
play
might
be
supposed
to
take
place
in
greece
or
rome
or
ancient
britain
it
mattered
not
the
actors
dressed
after
the
fashion
of
their
own
day
and
neither
actors
nor
audience
saw
anything
funny
in
it
to
them
it
was
not
funny
that
an
ancient
british
king
should
wear
doublet
and
hose
nor
that
his
soldiers
should
discharge
firearms
in
a
scene
supposed
to
take
place
hundreds
of
years
before
gunpowder
had
been
invented
but
we
must
remember
that
in
those
days
dress
meant
much
more
than
it
does
now
dress
helped
to
tell
the
story
men
then
might
not
dress
according
to
their
likes
and
dislikes
they
were
obliged
to
dress
according
to
their
rank
therefore
it
helped
the
elizabethan
onlooker
to
understand
the
play
when
he
saw
a
king
a
courtier
or
a
butcher
come
on
to
the
stage
dressed
as
he
knew
a
king
a
courtier
or
a
butcher
dressed
had
he
seen
a
man
of
the
sixth
century
dressed
as
a
man
of
the
sixth
century
he
would
not
have
known
to
what
class
he
belonged
and
would
not
have
understood
the
play
nearly
so
well
but
besides
having
no
scenery
the
people
of
england
had
at
first
no
theaters
plays
were
acted
in
halls
in
the
of
the
great
or
in
the
guild
halls
belonging
to
the
various
trades
it
was
not
until
that
the
first
theater
was
built
in
london
this
first
theater
was
so
successful
that
soon
another
was
built
and
still
another
until
in
or
near
london
there
were
no
fewer
than
twelve
but
these
theaters
were
very
unlike
the
theaters
we
know
now
they
were
really
more
like
the
places
where
people
went
to
see
and
they
were
round
and
except
over
the
stage
there
was
no
roof
the
rich
onlookers
who
could
afford
to
pay
well
sat
in
boxes
on
the
stage
itself
and
the
other
onlookers
sat
or
stood
in
the
uncovered
parts
part
of
a
theater
is
still
called
the
pit
which
helps
to
remind
us
that
the
first
theaters
may
have
served
as
or
too
as
well
as
theaters
for
a
long
time
too
the
theater
was
a
man
amusement
just
as
or
had
been
there
were
no
actresses
the
women
parts
were
taken
by
boys
and
at
first
ladies
when
they
came
to
look
on
wore
masks
so
that
they
might
not
be
known
as
they
were
rather
ashamed
of
being
seen
at
a
theater
and
now
that
the
love
of
plays
and
shows
had
grown
so
great
that
it
had
been
found
worth
while
to
build
special
places
in
which
to
act
you
may
be
sure
that
there
was
no
lack
of
there
were
indeed
many
of
whom
i
should
like
to
tell
you
but
in
this
book
there
is
no
room
to
tell
of
all
to
show
you
how
many
dramatists
arose
in
this
great
acting
age
i
will
give
you
a
list
of
the
greatest
all
of
whom
were
born
between
and
after
nicholas
udall
and
thomas
norton
and
thomas
sackville
the
writers
of
our
first
comedy
and
first
tragedy
there
came
george
peel
francis
beaumont
john
lyly
john
fletcher
thomas
kyd
john
webster
robert
greene
philip
massinger
christopher
marlowe
john
ford
william
shakespeare
thomas
heywood
ben
jonson
it
would
be
impossible
to
tell
you
of
all
these
so
i
shall
choose
only
two
and
first
i
shall
tell
you
of
the
greatest
of
them
shakespeare
he
shines
out
from
among
the
others
like
a
bright
star
in
a
clear
sky
he
is
however
not
a
lonely
star
for
all
around
him
cluster
others
they
are
bright
too
and
if
he
were
not
there
we
might
think
some
of
them
even
very
bright
yet
he
outshines
them
all
he
forces
our
eyes
to
turn
to
him
and
not
only
our
eyes
but
the
eyes
of
the
whole
world
for
all
over
the
world
wherever
poetry
is
read
and
plays
are
played
the
name
of
william
shakespeare
is
known
and
reverenced
chapter
xlv
shakespeare
the
boy
one
april
morning
nearly
three
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
there
was
a
stir
and
bustle
in
a
goodly
house
in
the
little
country
town
of
the
neighbors
went
in
and
out
with
nods
and
smiles
and
mysterious
whisperings
then
there
was
a
sound
of
clinking
of
glasses
and
of
laughter
for
it
became
known
that
to
john
and
mary
shakespeare
a
son
had
been
born
and
presently
there
was
brought
to
be
shown
to
the
company
the
infant
mewling
and
puking
in
the
nurse
arms
it
was
a
great
event
for
the
father
and
mother
something
of
an
event
for
for
john
shakespeare
was
a
man
of
importance
he
was
a
merchant
an
alderman
of
the
little
town
he
seems
to
have
done
business
in
several
ways
for
we
are
told
that
he
was
a
glover
a
butcher
and
a
corn
and
wool
dealer
no
doubt
he
grew
his
own
corn
and
reared
and
killed
his
own
sheep
making
gloves
from
the
skins
and
selling
the
wool
and
flesh
his
wife
too
came
of
a
good
yeoman
family
who
farmed
their
own
land
and
no
doubt
john
shakespeare
did
business
with
his
kinsfolk
in
both
corn
and
sheep
and
although
he
could
perhaps
not
read
and
could
not
write
even
his
own
name
he
was
a
lucky
business
man
and
prosperous
so
he
was
well
considered
by
his
neighbors
and
had
a
comfortable
house
in
henley
street
built
of
rough
plastered
stone
and
dark
strong
wood
work
and
now
this
april
morning
john
shakespeare
heart
was
glad
already
he
had
had
two
children
two
little
girls
but
they
had
both
died
now
he
had
a
son
who
would
surely
live
to
grow
strong
and
great
to
be
a
comfort
in
his
old
age
and
carry
on
his
business
when
he
could
no
longer
work
it
was
a
great
day
for
john
shakespeare
how
little
he
knew
that
it
was
a
great
day
for
all
the
world
and
for
all
time
three
days
after
he
was
born
the
tiny
baby
was
christened
and
the
name
his
father
and
mother
gave
him
was
william
after
this
three
months
passed
happily
then
one
of
the
fearful
plagues
which
used
to
sweep
over
the
land
when
people
lived
in
dark
and
dirty
houses
in
dark
and
dirty
streets
attacked
avon
jolly
john
shakespeare
and
mary
his
wife
must
have
been
anxious
of
heart
fearful
lest
the
plague
should
visit
their
home
john
did
what
he
could
to
stay
it
he
helped
the
stricken
people
with
money
and
goods
and
presently
the
plague
passed
away
and
the
life
of
the
dearly
loved
little
son
was
safe
years
passed
on
and
the
house
in
henley
street
grew
ever
more
noisy
with
chattering
tongues
and
pattering
feet
until
little
will
had
two
sisters
and
two
brothers
to
keep
him
company
then
although
his
father
and
mother
could
neither
of
them
write
themselves
they
decided
that
their
children
should
be
taught
so
william
was
sent
to
the
grammar
school
he
was
i
think
fonder
of
the
blue
sky
and
the
river
and
the
deep
dark
woods
that
grew
about
his
home
that
of
the
schoolroom
he
went
perhaps
a
whining
schoolboy
with
his
satchel
and
shining
morning
face
creeping
like
snail
unwillingly
to
school
but
we
do
not
know
and
whether
he
liked
school
or
not
at
least
we
know
that
later
when
he
came
to
write
plays
he
made
fun
of
schoolmasters
he
knew
little
latin
and
less
greek
said
a
friend
in
after
life
but
then
that
friend
was
very
learned
and
might
think
little
that
which
we
might
take
for
a
good
deal
indeed
another
old
writer
says
he
understood
latin
pretty
well
jonson
aubrey
we
know
little
either
of
shakespeare
school
hours
or
play
hours
but
once
or
twice
at
least
he
may
have
seen
a
play
or
pageant
his
father
went
on
prospering
and
was
made
chief
bailiff
of
the
town
and
while
in
that
office
he
entertained
twice
at
least
troups
of
strolling
players
the
queen
company
and
the
earl
of
worcester
company
it
is
very
likely
that
little
will
was
taken
to
see
the
plays
they
acted
then
when
he
was
eleven
years
old
there
was
great
excitement
in
the
country
town
for
queen
elizabeth
came
to
visit
the
great
earl
of
leicester
at
his
castle
of
kenilworth
not
sixteen
miles
away
there
were
great
doings
then
and
the
queen
was
received
with
all
the
magnificence
and
pomp
that
money
could
procure
and
imagination
invent
some
of
these
grand
shows
shakespeare
must
have
seen
long
afterwards
he
remembered
perhaps
how
one
evening
he
had
stood
among
the
crowd
tiptoeing
and
eager
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
great
queen
as
she
sat
enthroned
on
a
golden
chair
her
gold
hair
gleamed
and
glittered
with
jewels
under
the
flickering
torchlight
around
her
stood
a
crowd
of
nobles
and
ladies
only
less
brilliant
that
she
then
as
william
gazed
and
gazed
his
eyes
aching
with
the
dazzling
lights
there
was
a
movement
in
the
surging
crowd
a
murmur
of
ohs
and
ahs
and
turning
the
boy
saw
another
lady
another
queen
appear
from
out
the
dark
shadow
of
the
trees
stately
and
slowly
she
moved
across
the
grass
then
following
her
came
a
winged
boy
with
golden
bow
and
arrows
this
was
the
god
of
love
who
roamed
the
world
shooting
his
love
arrows
at
the
hearts
of
men
and
women
making
them
love
each
other
he
aimed
he
shot
the
arrow
flew
but
the
god
missed
his
aim
and
the
lady
passed
on
beautiful
cold
free
as
before
love
could
not
touch
her
he
followed
her
but
in
vain
it
was
with
such
pageants
such
allegories
that
her
people
flattered
queen
elizabeth
for
many
men
laid
their
hearts
at
her
feet
but
she
in
return
never
gave
her
own
she
was
the
woman
above
all
others
to
be
loved
to
be
worshiped
but
herself
remained
in
maiden
meditation
the
memory
of
those
brilliant
days
stayed
with
the
they
were
as
childish
memories
are
and
in
after
years
he
wrote
that
very
time
i
saw
but
thou
couldst
not
flying
between
the
cold
moon
and
the
earth
cupid
all
arm
a
certain
aim
he
took
at
a
fair
vestal
throned
by
the
west
and
loos
his
smartly
from
his
bow
as
it
should
pierce
a
hundred
thousand
hearts
but
i
might
see
young
cupid
fiery
shaft
quench
in
the
chaste
beams
of
the
watery
moon
and
the
imperial
votaress
passed
on
in
maiden
meditation
yet
mark
i
where
the
bolt
of
cupid
fell
it
fell
upon
a
little
western
flower
before
now
purple
with
love
wound
and
maidens
call
it
night
dream
act
ii
scene
i
some
time
after
john
shakespeare
became
chief
bailiff
his
fortunes
turned
from
being
rich
he
became
poor
bit
by
bit
he
was
obliged
to
sell
his
own
and
his
wife
property
so
little
will
was
taken
away
from
school
at
the
age
of
thirteen
and
set
to
earn
his
own
living
as
a
butcher
his
father
trade
we
are
told
but
if
he
ever
was
a
butcher
he
was
nevertheless
an
actor
and
a
poet
and
when
he
killed
a
calf
he
would
do
it
in
a
high
style
and
make
a
speech
how
shakespeare
fared
in
this
new
work
we
do
not
know
but
we
may
fancy
him
when
work
was
done
wandering
along
the
pretty
country
lanes
or
losing
himself
in
the
forest
of
arden
which
lay
not
far
from
his
home
the
poet
eye
in
a
fine
frenzy
rolling
and
singing
to
himself
jog
on
jog
on
the
footpath
way
and
merrily
hent
the
a
merry
heart
goes
all
the
day
your
sad
tires
in
a
tale
act
iv
scene
ii
aubrey
he
knew
the
lore
of
fields
and
woods
of
trees
and
flowers
and
birds
and
beasts
he
sang
of
the
so
black
of
hue
with
bill
the
throstle
with
his
note
so
true
the
wren
with
little
quill
the
finch
the
sparrow
and
the
lark
the
cuckoo
gray
whose
note
full
many
a
man
doth
mark
and
dares
not
answer
nay
night

act
iii
scene
i
he
remembered
perhaps
in
after
years
his
rambles
by
the
flowing
avon
when
he
wrote
he
makes
sweet
music
with
th
enamell
stones
giving
a
gentle
kiss
to
every
sedge
he
overtaketh
in
his
pilgrimage
and
so
by
many
winding
nooks
he
strays
with
willing
sport
to
the
wide
ocean
gentlemen
of
verona
act
ii
scene
vii
he
knew
the
times
of
the
flowers
in
spring
he
marked
the
daffodils
that
come
before
the
swallow
dares
and
take
the
winds
of
march
with
beauty
tale
of
summer
flowers
he
tells
us
hot
lavender
mints
savory
marjoram
the
marigold
that
goes
to
bed
wi
the
sun
and
with
him
rises
weeping
these
are
flowers
of
middle
summer
tale
he
knew
that
a
lapwing
runs
close
by
the
ground
that
choughs
are
he
knew
all
the
beauty
that
is
to
be
found
throughout
the
country
year
sometimes
in
his
country
wanderings
shakespeare
got
into
mischief
too
he
had
a
daring
spirit
and
on
quiet
dark
nights
he
could
creep
silently
about
the
woods
snaring
rabbits
or
hunting
deer
but
we
are
told
he
was
given
to
all
unluckiness
in
stealing
venison
and
rabbits
he
was
often
caught
sometimes
got
a
good
beating
and
sometimes
was
sent
to
prison
davies
so
the
years
passed
on
and
we
know
little
of
what
happened
in
them
some
people
like
to
think
that
shakespeare
was
a
schoolmaster
for
a
time
others
that
he
was
a
clerk
in
a
office
he
may
have
been
one
or
other
but
we
do
not
know
what
we
do
know
is
that
when
he
was
eighteen
he
took
a
great
step
he
married
we
can
imagine
him
making
then
perhaps
he
sang
o
mistress
mine
where
are
you
roaming
o
stay
and
hear
your
coming
that
can
sing
both
high
and
low
trip
no
further
pretty
sweeting
journeys
end
in
lovers
meeting
every
wise
man
son
doth
know
what
is
love
is
not
hereafter
present
mirth
hath
present
laughter
what
to
come
is
still
unsure
in
delay
there
lies
no
plenty
then
come
kiss
me
youth
a
stuff
will
not
endure
night
the
lady
whom
shakespeare
married
was
named
anne
hathaway
she
came
of
farmer
folk
like
shakespeare
own
mother
she
was
eight
years
older
than
her
boyish
lover
but
beyond
that
we
know
little
of
anne
hathaway
for
shakespeare
never
anywhere
mentions
his
wife
a
little
while
after
their
marriage
a
daughter
was
born
to
anne
and
william
shakespeare
nearly
two
years
later
a
little
boy
and
girl
came
to
them
the
boy
died
when
he
was
about
eleven
and
only
the
two
little
girls
judith
and
susanna
lived
to
grow
up
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
shakespeare
had
now
a
wife
and
children
to
look
after
he
had
not
settled
down
he
was
still
wild
and
being
caught
once
more
in
stealing
game
he
left
stratford
and
went
to
london
chapter
xlvi
shakespeare
the
man
when
shakespeare
first
went
to
london
he
had
a
hard
life
he
found
no
better
work
to
do
than
that
of
holding
horses
outside
the
theater
doors
in
those
days
the
plays
took
place
in
the
afternoon
and
as
many
of
the
fine
folk
who
came
to
watch
them
rode
on
horseback
some
one
was
needed
to
look
after
the
horses
until
the
play
was
over
but
poor
though
this
work
was
shakespeare
seems
to
have
done
it
well
and
he
became
such
a
favorite
that
he
had
several
boys
under
him
who
were
long
known
as
shakespeare
boys
their
master
however
soon
left
work
outside
the
theater
for
work
inside
and
now
began
the
busiest
years
of
his
life
for
he
both
acted
and
wrote
at
first
it
may
be
he
only
altered
and
improved
the
plays
of
others
but
soon
he
began
to
write
plays
that
were
all
his
own
yet
shakespeare
like
chaucer
never
invented
any
of
his
own
stories
there
is
only
one
play
of
his
called
love
labor
lost
the
story
of
which
is
not
to
be
found
in
some
earlier
book
that
too
may
have
been
founded
on
another
story
which
is
now
lost
when
you
come
to
know
shakespeare
plays
well
you
will
find
it
very
interesting
to
follow
his
stories
to
their
sources
that
of
king
lear
which
is
one
of
shakespeare
great
romantic
historical
plays
is
for
instance
to
be
found
in
geoffrey
of
monmouth
in
wace
brut
and
in
layamon
brut
but
it
was
from
none
of
these
that
shakespeare
took
the
story
but
from
the
chronicle
of
a
man
named
holinshed
who
lived
and
wrote
in
the
time
of
queen
elizabeth
he
in
his
turn
having
taken
it
from
some
one
of
the
earlier
sources
for
after
all
in
spite
of
the
thousands
of
books
that
have
been
written
since
the
world
began
there
are
only
a
certain
number
of
stories
which
great
writers
have
told
again
and
again
in
varying
ways
one
instance
of
this
we
saw
when
in
the
beginning
of
this
book
we
followed
the
story
of
arthur
but
although
shakespeare
borrowed
his
plots
from
others
when
he
had
borrowed
them
he
made
them
all
his
own
he
made
his
people
so
vivid
and
so
true
that
he
makes
us
forget
that
they
are
not
real
people
we
can
hardly
realize
that
they
never
lived
that
they
never
walked
and
talked
and
cried
and
laughed
loved
and
hated
in
this
world
just
as
we
do
and
this
is
so
because
the
stage
to
him
is
life
and
life
a
stage
all
the
world
a
stage
he
says
and
all
the
men
and
women
merely
players
they
have
their
exits
and
their
entrances
and
one
man
in
his
time
plays
many
parts
his
acts
being
seven
ages
you
like
it
and
again
he
tells
us
life
but
a
walking
shadow
a
poor
player
that
struts
and
frets
his
hour
upon
the
stage
and
then
is
heard
no
more
it
is
from
shakespeare
works
that
we
get
the
clearest
picture
of
elizabethan
times
and
yet
although
we
learn
from
him
so
much
of
what
people
did
in
those
days
of
how
they
talked
and
even
of
how
they
thought
the
chief
thing
that
we
feel
about
shakespeare
characters
is
not
that
they
are
elizabethan
but
that
they
are
human
that
they
are
like
ourselves
that
they
think
and
say
and
do
things
which
we
ourselves
might
think
and
say
and
do
there
are
many
books
we
read
which
we
think
of
as
very
pretty
very
quaint
very
interesting
but
but
shakespeare
can
never
be
because
although
he
is
the
outcome
of
his
own
times
and
gives
us
all
the
flavor
of
his
own
times
he
gives
us
much
more
he
understood
human
nature
he
saw
beneath
the
outward
dress
and
painted
for
us
real
men
and
women
and
although
fashion
in
dress
and
modes
of
living
may
change
human
nature
does
not
change
he
was
not
of
an
age
but
for
all
time
it
was
said
of
him
about
seven
years
after
his
death
and
now
that
nearly
three
hundred
years
have
come
and
gone
we
still
acknowledge
the
truth
of
those
words
shakespeare
men
and
women
speak
and
act
and
feel
in
the
main
as
we
might
now
many
of
his
people
we
feel
are
our
brothers
and
sisters
and
to
this
human
interest
he
adds
something
more
for
he
leads
us
too
through
unpathed
waters
to
the
undreamed
shores
of
fairyland
shakespeare
writing
time
was
short
before
he
left
stratford
he
wrote
nothing
unless
it
may
have
been
a
few
scoffing
verses
against
the
justice
of
the
peace
who
punished
him
for
poaching
but
these
if
they
were
ever
written
are
lost
in
the
last
few
years
of
his
life
he
wrote
little
or
nothing
thus
the
number
of
his
writing
years
was
not
more
than
twenty
to
but
in
that
time
he
wrote
plays
two
long
poems
and
a
hundred
and
sonnets
at
one
time
he
must
have
written
two
plays
every
year
and
when
you
come
to
know
these
plays
well
you
will
wonder
at
the
greatness
of
the
task
shakespeare
writes
his
plays
sometimes
in
rime
sometimes
in
blank
verse
sometimes
in
prose
at
times
using
all
these
in
one
play
in
this
he
showed
how
free
he
was
from
rules
for
until
he
wrote
plays
had
been
written
in
rime
or
blank
verse
only
for
the
sake
of
convenience
shakespeare
plays
have
been
divided
into
histories
tragedies
and
comedies
but
it
is
not
always
easy
to
draw
the
line
and
decide
to
which
class
a
play
belongs
they
are
like
life
life
is
not
all
laughter
nor
is
it
all
tears
neither
are
shakespeare
comedies
all
laughter
and
some
of
his
tragedies
would
seem
at
times
to
be
too
deep
for
tears
full
only
of
fierce
dark
sorrow
and
yet
there
is
laughter
in
them
too
besides
being
divided
into
histories
tragedies
and
comedies
they
have
been
divided
in
another
way
into
three
periods
of
time
the
first
was
when
shakespeare
was
trying
his
hand
when
he
was
brimming
over
with
the
joy
of
the
new
full
life
of
london
the
second
was
when
some
dark
sorrow
lay
over
his
life
we
know
not
what
when
the
pain
and
mystery
and
the
irony
of
living
seems
to
strike
him
hard
then
he
wrote
his
great
tragedies
the
third
was
when
he
had
gained
peace
again
when
life
seemed
to
flow
calmly
and
smoothly
and
this
period
lasted
until
the
end
we
know
very
little
of
shakespeare
life
in
london
as
an
actor
he
never
made
a
great
name
never
acted
the
chief
character
in
a
play
but
he
acted
sometimes
in
his
own
plays
and
took
the
part
we
are
told
of
a
ghost
in
one
and
of
a
servant
in
another
neither
of
them
great
parts
he
acted
too
in
plays
written
by
other
people
but
it
was
as
a
writer
that
he
made
a
name
and
that
so
quickly
that
others
grew
jealous
of
him
one
called
him
an
upstart
crow
beautified
in
our
feathers
in
his
own
conceit
the
only
in
the
country
but
for
the
most
part
shakespeare
made
friends
even
of
rival
authors
and
many
of
them
loved
him
well
he
was
merry
witty
and
kindly
a
most
lovable
man
he
was
a
handsome
man
very
good
company
and
a
very
ready
and
pleasant
smooth
wit
said
one
i
loved
the
man
and
do
honor
to
his
memory
on
this
side
of
idolatry
as
much
as
any
he
was
indeed
honest
and
of
an
open
and
free
nature
said
another
others
still
called
him
a
good
fellow
gentle
shakespeare
sweet
master
shakespeare
i
should
like
to
think
too
that
spenser
called
him
our
pleasant
willy
but
wise
folk
tell
us
that
these
words
were
not
spoken
of
shakespeare
but
of
some
one
else
whose
name
was
not
william
at
all
greene
a
groatsworth
of
wit
bought
with
a
million
of
repentance
aubrey
jonson
and
so
although
outside
his
work
we
get
only
glimpses
of
the
man
these
glimpses
taken
together
with
his
writings
show
us
will
shakespeare
as
a
man
a
man
who
understood
all
and
forgave
all
he
understood
the
little
joys
and
sorrows
that
make
up
life
he
understood
the
struggle
to
be
good
and
would
not
scorn
people
too
greatly
when
they
were
bad
children
we
feel
sure
says
one
of
the
latest
writers
about
him
did
not
stop
their
talk
when
he
came
near
them
but
continued
in
the
happy
assurance
that
it
was
only
master
shakespeare
and
so
if
children
find
his
plays
hard
to
read
yet
a
while
they
may
at
least
learn
to
know
his
stories
and
learn
to
love
his
name
it
is
only
master
shakespeare
but
they
must
remember
that
learning
to
know
shakespeare
stories
through
the
words
of
other
people
is
only
half
a
joy
the
full
joy
of
shakespeare
can
only
come
when
we
are
able
to
read
his
plays
in
his
very
own
words
but
that
will
come
all
the
more
easily
and
quickly
to
us
if
we
first
know
his
stories
well
raleigh
there
are
parts
in
some
of
shakespeare
plays
that
many
people
find
coarse
but
shakespeare
is
not
really
coarse
we
remember
the
vision
sent
to
peter
which
taught
him
that
there
was
nothing
common
or
unclean
shakespeare
had
seen
that
vision
in
life
there
is
nothing
common
or
unclean
if
we
only
look
at
it
in
the
right
way
and
shakespeare
speaks
of
everything
that
touches
life
most
nearly
he
uses
words
that
we
do
not
use
now
he
speaks
of
things
we
do
not
speak
of
now
but
it
was
the
fashion
of
his
day
to
be
more
open
and
plain
spoken
than
we
are
and
if
we
remember
that
there
is
very
little
in
shakespeare
that
need
hurt
us
even
if
there
is
a
great
deal
which
we
can
not
understand
and
when
you
come
to
read
some
of
the
writers
of
age
and
see
that
in
them
the
laughter
is
often
brutal
the
horror
of
tragedy
often
coarse
and
crude
you
will
wonder
more
than
ever
how
shakespeare
made
his
laughter
so
sweet
and
sunny
and
how
instead
of
revolting
us
he
touches
our
hearts
with
his
horror
and
pain
about
eleven
years
passed
after
shakespeare
left
stratford
before
he
returned
there
again
but
once
having
returned
he
often
paid
visits
to
his
old
home
and
he
came
now
no
more
as
a
poor
wild
lad
given
to
poaching
he
came
as
a
man
of
wealth
and
fame
he
bought
the
best
house
in
stratford
called
new
place
as
well
as
a
good
deal
of
land
so
before
john
shakespeare
died
he
saw
his
family
once
more
important
in
the
town
then
as
the
years
went
on
shakespeare
gave
up
all
connection
with
london
and
the
theater
and
settled
down
to
a
quiet
country
life
he
planted
trees
managed
his
estate
and
showed
that
though
he
was
the
world
he
was
a
good
business
man
too
everything
prospered
with
him
his
two
daughters
married
well
and
comfortably
and
when
not
more
than
he
held
his
first
grandchild
in
his
arms
it
may
be
he
looked
forward
to
many
happy
peaceful
years
when
death
took
him
he
died
of
fever
brought
on
no
doubt
by
the
evil
smells
and
bad
air
by
which
people
lived
surrounded
in
those
days
before
they
had
learned
to
be
clean
in
house
and
street
shakespeare
was
only
when
he
died
it
was
in
the
springtime
of
that
he
died
breathing
his
last
upon
the
uncertain
glory
of
an
april
day
which
now
shows
all
the
beauty
of
the
sun
and
by
and
by
a
cloud
takes
all
away
gentlemen
of
verona
he
was
buried
in
stratford
parish
church
and
on
his
grave
was
placed
a
bust
of
the
poet
that
bust
and
an
engraving
in
the
beginning
of
the
first
great
edition
of
his
works
are
the
only
two
real
portraits
of
shakespeare
both
were
done
after
his
death
and
yet
perhaps
there
is
no
face
more
well
known
to
us
than
that
of
the
greatest
of
all
poets
beneath
the
bust
are
written
these
lines

chapter
lxvii
shakespeare
the
merchant
of
venice
in
this
chapter
i
am
going
to
tell
you
in
a
few
words
the
story
of
one
of
shakespeare
plays
called
the
merchant
of
venice
it
is
founded
on
an
italian
story
one
of
a
collection
made
by
ser
giovanni
fiorentino
the
merchant
of
venice
was
a
rich
young
man
called
antonio
when
the
story
opens
he
had
ventured
all
his
money
in
trading
expeditions
to
the
east
and
other
lands
in
two
months
time
he
expects
the
return
of
his
ships
and
hopes
then
to
make
a
great
deal
of
money
but
meantime
he
has
none
to
spare
and
when
his
great
friend
bassanio
comes
to
borrow
of
him
he
can
not
give
him
any
bassanio
need
is
urgent
for
he
loves
the
beautiful
lady
portia
and
desires
to
marry
her
this
lady
was
so
lovely
and
so
rich
that
her
fame
had
spread
over
all
the
world
till
the
four
winds
blow
in
from
every
coast
renowned
suitors
bassanio
would
be
among
these
suitors
but
alas
he
has
no
money
not
even
enough
to
pay
for
the
journey
to
belmont
where
the
lovely
lady
lived
yet
if
he
wait
two
months
until
antonio
ships
return
it
may
be
too
late
and
portia
may
be
married
to
another
so
to
supply
his
friend
need
antonio
decides
to
borrow
the
money
and
soon
a
jew
named
shylock
is
found
who
is
willing
to
lend
it
for
shylock
was
a
he
lent
money
to
people
who
had
need
of
it
and
charged
them
interest
that
is
besides
having
to
pay
back
the
full
sum
they
had
borrowed
they
had
also
to
pay
some
extra
money
in
return
for
the
loan
in
those
days
jews
were
and
despised
and
there
was
great
hatred
between
them
and
christians
and
shylock
especially
hated
antonio
because
not
only
did
he
rail
against
jews
and
insult
them
but
he
also
lent
money
without
demanding
interest
thereby
spoiling
shylock
trade
so
now
the
jew
lays
a
trap
for
antonio
hoping
to
catch
him
and
be
revenged
upon
his
enemy
he
will
lend
the
money
he
says
and
he
will
charge
no
interest
but
if
the
loan
be
not
repaid
in
three
months
antonio
must
pay
as
forfeit
a
pound
of
his
own
flesh
which
shylock
may
cut
from
any
part
of
his
body
that
he
chooses
to
this
strange
bargain
antonio
consents
it
is
but
a
jest
he
thinks
content
in
faith
i
seal
to
such
a
bond
and
say
there
is
much
kindness
in
the
jew
but
bassanio
is
uneasy
i
like
not
fair
terms
he
says
and
a
villain
mind
you
shall
not
seal
to
such
a
bond
for
me
but
antonio
insists
and
the
bond
is
sealed
all
being
settled
bassanio
receives
the
money
and
before
he
sets
off
to
woo
his
lady
he
gives
a
supper
to
all
his
friends
to
which
he
also
invites
shylock
shylock
goes
to
this
supper
although
to
his
daughter
jessica
he
says
but
wherefore
should
i
go
i
am
not
bid
for
love
they
flatter
me
but
yet
i
go
in
hate
to
feed
upon
the
prodigal
christian
but
jessica
does
not
join
her
father
in
his
hatred
of
all
christians
she
indeed
has
given
her
heart
to
one
of
the
hated
race
and
well
knowing
that
her
father
will
never
allow
her
to
marry
him
she
that
night
while
he
is
at
supper
with
bassanio
dresses
herself
in
boy
clothes
and
steals
away
taking
with
her
a
great
quantity
of
jewels
and
money
when
shylock
discovers
his
loss
he
is
mad
with
grief
and
rage
he
runs
about
the
streets
crying
for
justice
justice
the
law
my
ducats
and
my
daughter
a
sealed
bag
two
sealed
bags
of
ducats
of
double
ducats
from
me
by
my
daughter
and
all
the
wild
boys
in
venice
follow
after
him
mocking
him
and
crying
his
stones
his
daughter
and
his
ducats
so
finding
nowhere
love
or
sympathy
but
everywhere
only
mockery
and
cruel
laughter
shylock
vows
vengeance
the
world
has
treated
him
ill
and
he
will
repay
the
world
with
ill
and
chiefly
against
antonio
does
his
anger
grow
bitter
then
antonio
friends
shake
their
heads
and
say
let
him
beware
the
hatred
of
the
jew
they
look
gravely
at
each
other
for
it
is
whispered
abroad
that
antonio
hath
a
ship
of
rich
lading
wreck
on
the
narrow
seas
then
let
antonio
beware
thou
wilt
not
take
his
flesh
says
one
of
the
young
friends
to
shylock
what
that
good
for
to
bait
fish
withal
snarls
the
jew
if
it
will
feed
nothing
else
it
will
feed
my
revenge
he
hath
disgraced
me
and
hindered
me
half
a
million
laughed
at
my
losses
mocked
at
my
gains
scorned
my
nation
thwarted
my
bargains
cooled
my
friends
heated
mine
enemies
and
what
his
reason
i
am
a
jew
hath
not
a
jew
eyes
hath
not
a
jew
hands
organs
dimensions
senses
affections
passions
fed
with
the
same
food
hurt
with
the
same
weapons
subject
to
the
same
diseases
healed
by
the
same
means
warmed
and
cooled
by
the
same
winter
and
summer
as
a
christian
is
if
you
prick
us
do
we
not
bleed
if
you
tickle
us
do
we
not
laugh
if
you
poison
us
do
we
not
die
if
you
wrong
us
shall
we
not
revenge
if
we
are
like
you
in
the
rest
we
will
resemble
you
in
that
if
a
jew
wrong
a
christian
what
is
his
humility
revenge
if
a
christian
wrong
a
jew
what
should
his
sufferance
be
by
christian
example
why
revenge
the
villainy
you
teach
me
i
will
execute
and
it
shall
go
hard
but
i
will
better
the
instruction
then
let
antonio
beware
meantime
in
belmont
many
lovers
come
to
woo
fair
portia
with
high
hope
they
come
with
anger
and
disappointment
they
go
away
none
can
win
the
lady
hand
for
there
is
a
riddle
here
of
which
none
know
the
meaning
when
a
suitor
presents
himself
and
asks
for
the
lady
hand
in
marriage
he
is
shown
three
caskets
one
of
gold
one
of
silver
and
one
of
lead
upon
the
golden
one
is
written
the
words
who
chooseth
me
shall
gain
what
many
men
desire
upon
the
silver
casket
are
the
words
who
chooseth
me
shall
get
as
much
as
he
deserves
and
upon
the
leaden
one
who
chooseth
me
must
give
and
hazard
all
he
hath
and
only
whoso
chooseth
aright
each
suitor
is
told
can
win
the
lady
this
trial
of
all
suitors
had
been
ordered
by
portia
father
ere
he
died
so
that
only
a
worthy
and
true
man
might
win
his
daughter
some
suitors
choose
the
gold
some
the
silver
casket
but
all
princes
barons
counts
and
dukes
alike
choose
wrong
at
length
bassanio
comes
already
he
loves
portia
and
she
loves
him
there
is
no
need
of
any
trail
of
the
caskets
yet
it
must
be
her
father
will
must
be
obeyed
but
what
if
he
choose
wrong
that
is
portia
fear
i
pray
you
tarry
pause
a
day
or
two
before
you
hazard
for
in
choosing
wrong
i
lose
your
company
she
says
but
bassanio
can
not
wait
let
me
choose
for
as
i
am
i
live
upon
the
rack
and
so
he
stands
before
the
caskets
longing
to
make
a
choice
yet
fearful
the
gold
he
rejects
the
silver
too
and
lays
his
hand
upon
the
leaden
casket
he
opens
it
oh
joy
within
is
a
portrait
of
his
lady
he
has
chosen
aright
yet
he
can
scarce
believe
his
happiness
i
am
he
says
like
one
of
two
contending
in
a
prize
that
thinks
he
hath
done
well
in
people
eyes
hearing
applause
and
universal
shout
giddy
in
spirit
still
gazing
in
a
doubt
whether
those
pearls
of
praise
be
his
or
no
so
thrice
fair
lady
stand
i
even
so
as
doubtful
whether
what
i
see
be
true
until
confirm
sign
ratifi
by
you
and
portia
happy
triumphant
humble
no
longer
the
great
lady
with
untold
wealth
with
lands
and
palaces
and
radiant
beauty
but
merely
a
woman
who
has
given
her
love
answers
you
see
me
lord
bassanio
where
i
stand
such
as
i
am
though
for
myself
alone
i
would
not
be
ambitious
in
my
wish
to
wish
myself
much
better
yet
for
you
i
would
be
trebled
twenty
times
myself
a
thousand
times
more
fair
ten
thousand
times
more
rich
that
only
to
stand
high
on
your
account
i
might
in
virtues
beauties
livings
friends
exceed
account
but
the
full
sum
of
me
is
sum
of
something
which
to
term
in
gross
is
an
unlesson
girl
unschool
unpractis
happy
in
this
she
is
not
yet
so
old
but
she
may
learn
happier
than
this
she
is
not
bred
so
dull
but
she
can
learn
happiest
of
all
is
that
her
gentle
spirit
commite
itself
to
yours
to
be
directed
as
from
her
lord
her
governor
her
king
myself
and
what
is
mine
to
you
and
yours
is
now
converted
but
now
i
was
the
lord
of
this
fair
mansion
master
of
my
servants
queen
myself
and
even
now
but
now
this
house
these
servants
and
this
same
myself
are
yours
my
lord
then
as
a
pledge
of
all
her
love
portia
gives
to
bassanio
a
ring
and
bids
him
never
part
from
it
so
long
as
he
shall
live
and
bassanio
taking
it
gladly
swears
to
keep
it
forever
but
when
this
ring
parts
from
this
finger
then
parts
life
from
hence
o
then
be
bold
to
say
bassanio
dead
and
then
as
if
to
make
the
joy
complete
it
is
discovered
that
portia
lady
in
waiting
nerissa
and
bassanio
friend
gratiano
also
love
each
other
and
they
all
agree
to
be
married
on
the
same
day
in
the
midst
of
this
happiness
the
runaway
couple
lorenzo
and
jessica
arrive
from
venice
with
another
of
antonio
friends
who
brings
a
letter
to
bassanio
as
bassanio
reads
the
letter
all
the
gladness
fades
from
his
face
he
grows
pale
and
trembles
anxiously
portia
asks
what
troubles
him
i
am
half
yourself
and
i
must
freely
have
the
half
of
anything
that
this
same
paper
brings
you
and
bassanio
answers
o
sweet
portia
here
are
a
few
of
the
words
that
ever
blotted
paper
gentle
lady
when
i
did
first
impart
my
love
to
you
i
freely
told
you
all
the
wealth
i
had
ran
in
my
veins
i
was
a
gentleman
and
then
i
told
you
true
and
yet
dear
lady
rating
myself
at
nothing
you
shall
see
how
much
i
was
a
braggart
when
i
told
you
my
state
was
nothing
i
should
then
have
told
you
that
i
was
worse
than
nothing
he
is
worse
than
nothing
for
he
is
in
debt
to
his
friend
and
that
friend
for
him
is
now
in
danger
of
his
life
for
the
three
months
allowed
by
shylock
for
the
payment
of
the
debt
are
over
and
as
not
one
of
antonio
ships
has
returned
he
can
not
pay
the
money
many
friends
have
offered
to
pay
for
him
but
shylock
will
have
none
of
their
gold
he
does
not
want
it
what
he
wants
is
revenge
he
wants
antonio
life
and
well
he
knows
if
a
pound
of
flesh
be
cut
from
this
poor
merchant
breast
he
must
die
and
all
for
three
thousand
ducats
oh
cries
portia
when
she
hears
what
a
paltry
sum
pay
the
jew
ten
times
the
money
and
tear
up
the
bond
rather
than
that
antonio
shall
lose
a
single
hair
through
bassanio
fault
it
is
no
use
she
is
told
shylock
will
have
his
bond
and
nothing
but
his
bond
if
that
be
so
then
must
bassanio
hasten
to
his
friend
to
comfort
him
at
least
so
the
wedding
is
hurried
on
and
immediately
after
it
bassanio
and
gratiano
hasten
away
leaving
their
new
wives
behind
them
but
portia
has
no
mind
to
sit
at
home
and
do
nothing
while
her
husband
friend
is
in
danger
of
his
life
as
soon
as
bassanio
has
gone
she
gives
her
house
into
the
keeping
of
lorenzo
and
sets
out
for
venice
from
her
cousin
the
great
lawyer
bellario
she
borrows
lawyer
robes
for
herself
and
those
of
a
clerk
for
nerissa
and
thus
disguised
they
reach
venice
safely
this
part
of
the
story
has
brought
us
to
the
fourth
act
of
the
play
and
when
the
curtain
rises
on
this
act
we
see
the
court
of
justice
in
venice
the
duke
and
all
his
courtiers
are
present
the
prisoner
antonio
with
bassanio
and
many
others
of
his
friends
shylock
is
called
in
the
duke
tries
to
soften
the
jew
heart
and
make
him
turn
to
mercy
in
vain
bassanio
also
tries
in
vain
and
still
bellario
to
whom
the
duke
has
sent
for
aid
comes
not
at
this
moment
nerissa
dressed
as
a
lawyer
clerk
enters
bearing
a
letter
the
letter
is
from
bellario
recommending
a
young
lawyer
named
balthazar
to
plead
antonio
cause
this
is
of
course
none
other
than
portia
she
is
admitted
and
at
once
begins
the
case
you
stand
within
his
danger
do
you
not
she
says
to
antonio
antonio
i
do
portia
then
must
the
jew
be
merciful
shylock
on
what
compulsion
must
i
tell
me
that
portia
the
quality
of
mercy
is
not
strained
it
droppeth
as
the
gentle
rain
from
heaven
upon
the
place
beneath
it
is
twice
blessed
it
blesseth
him
that
gives
and
him
that
takes
is
mightiest
in
the
mightiest
it
becomes
the
thronéd
monarch
better
than
his
crown
his
scepter
shows
the
force
of
temporal
power
the
attribute
to
awe
and
majesty
wherein
doth
sit
the
dread
and
fear
of
kings
but
mercy
is
above
this
sceptr
sway
it
is
enthronéd
in
the
hearts
of
kings
it
is
an
attribute
to
god
himself
and
earthly
power
doth
then
show
likest
when
mercy
seasons
justice
therefore
jew
though
justice
be
thy
plea
consider
this
that
in
the
course
of
justice
none
of
us
shall
see
salvation
we
do
pray
for
mercy
and
that
same
prayer
doth
teach
us
all
to
render
the
deeds
of
mercy
i
have
spoke
thus
much
to
mitigate
the
justice
of
thy
plea
which
if
thou
follow
this
strict
court
of
venice
must
needs
give
sentence
the
merchant
there
shylock
my
deeds
upon
my
head
i
crave
the
law
the
penalty
and
forfeit
of
my
bond
portia
is
he
not
able
to
discharge
the
money
bassanio
yes
here
i
tender
it
for
him
in
the
court
yea
twice
the
sum
if
that
will
not
suffice
i
will
be
bound
to
pay
it
ten
times
on
forfeit
of
my
hands
my
head
my
heart
if
this
will
not
suffice
it
must
appear
that
malice
bears
down
truth
and
i
beseech
you
wrest
once
the
law
to
your
authority
to
do
a
great
right
do
a
little
wrong
and
curb
this
cruel
devil
of
his
will
portia
it
must
not
be
there
is
no
power
in
venice
can
alter
a
decree
established
be
recorded
for
a
precedent
and
many
an
error
by
the
same
example
will
rush
into
the
state
it
can
not
be
shylock
a
daniel
come
to
judgement
yea

daniel

wise
young
judge

jew
so
seeing
himself
beaten
on

points
the
jew
would
leave
the
court
but
not
yet
is
he
allowed
to
go
not
until
he
has
been
fined
for
attempting
to
take
the
life
of
a
venetian
citizen
not
until
he
is
humiliated
and
so
heaped
with
disgrace
and
insult
that
we
are
sorry
for
him
is
he
allowed
to
creep
away
the
learned
lawyer
is
loaded
with
thanks
and
bassanio
wishes
to
pay
him
nobly
for
his
pains
but
he
will
take
nothing
nothing
that
is
but
the
ring
which
glitters
on
bassanio
finger
that
bassanio
can
not
give
it
is
his
wife
present
and
he
has
promised
never
to
part
with
it
at
that
the
lawyer
pretends
anger
i
see
sir
he
says
you
are
liberal
in
offers
you
taught
me
first
to
beg
and
now
methinks
you
teach
me
how
a
beggar
should
be
answered
hardly
have
they
parted
than
bassanio
repents
his
seemingly
churlish
action
has
not
this
young
man
saved
his
friend
from
death
and
himself
from
disgrace
portia
will
surely
understand
that
his
request
could
not
be
refused
and
so
he
sends
gratiano
after
him
with
the
ring
gratiano
gives
the
ring
to
the
lawyer
and
the
seeming
clerk
begs
gratiano
for
his
ring
which
he
following
his
friend
example
gives
in
the
last
act
of
the
play
all
the
friends
are
gathered
again
at
belmont
after
some
merry
teasing
upon
the
subject
of
the
rings
the
truth
is
told
and
bassanio
and
gratiano
learn
that
the
skillful
lawyer
and
his
clerk
were
none
other
than
their
young
and

jonson
every
man
in
his
humour
of
all
the
dramatists
who
were
shakespeare
friends
of
those
who
wrote
before
him
with
him
and
just
after
him
we
have
little
room
to
tell
but
there
is
one
who
stands
almost
as
far
above
them
all
as
shakespeare
stands
above
him
this
is
ben
jonson
and
of
him
we
must
speak
ben
jonson
life
began
in
poverty
his
father
dying
before
he
was
born
and
leaving
his
widow
poorly
provided
for
when
ben
was
about
two
years
old
his
mother
married
again
and
this
second
husband
was
a
bricklayer
ben
however
tells
us
that
his
own
father
was
a
gentleman
belonging
to
a
good
old
scottish
border
family
and
that
he
had
lost
all
his
estates
in
the
reign
of
queen
mary
but
about
the
truth
of
this
we
do
not
know
for
ben
was
a
bragger
and
a
swaggerer
he
may
not
have
belonged
to
this
scottish
family
and
he
may
have
had
no
estates
to
lose
ben
first
went
to
a
little
school
at
in
london
there
somehow
the
second
master
of
westminster
school
came
to
know
of
him
became
his
friend
and
took
him
to
westminster
where
he
paid
for
his
schooling
but
when
ben
left
school
he
had
to
earn
a
living
in
some
way
so
he
became
a
bricklayer
like
his
when
having
a
trowell
in
his
hand
he
had
a
book
in
his
pocket
he
did
not
long
remain
a
bricklayer
however
for
he
could
not
endure
the
life
and
next
we
find
him
a
soldier
in
the
netherlands
we
know
very
little
of
what
he
did
as
a
soldier
and
soon
he
was
home
again
in
england
here
he
married
his
wife
was
a
good
woman
but
with
a
sharp
tongue
and
the
marriage
does
not
seem
to
have
been
very
happy
and
although
they
had
several
children
all
of
them
died
young
and
now
like
shakespeare
jonson
became
an
actor
like
shakespeare
too
he
wrote
plays
his
first
play
is
that
by
which
he
is
best
known
called
every
man
in
his
humour
by
a
humor
jonson
means
his
chief
characteristic
one
man
for
instance
showing
himself
jealous
another
boastful
and
so
on
it
will
be
a
long
time
before
you
will
care
to
read
every
man
in
his
humour
for
there
is
a
great
deal
in
it
that
you
would
neither
understand
nor
like
it
is
a
play
of
the
manners
and
customs
of
elizabethan
times
which
are
so
unlike
ours
that
we
have
little
sympathy
with
them
and
that
is
the
difference
between
ben
jonson
and
shakespeare
shakespeare
although
he
wrote
of
his
own
time
wrote
for
all
time
jonson
wrote
of
his
own
time
for
his
own
time
yet
in
every
man
in
his
humour
there
is
at
least
one
character
worthy
to
live
beside
shakespeare
and
that
is
the
blustering
boastful
captain
bobadill
he
talks
very
grandly
but
when
it
comes
to
fighting
he
thinks
it
best
to
run
away
and
live
to
fight
another
day
if
only
to
know
captain
bobadill
it
will
repay
you
to
read
every
man
in
his
humour
when
you
grow
up
here
is
a
scene
in
which
he
shows
his
humor
delightfully
bobadill
i
am
a
gentleman
and
live
here
obscure
and
to
myself
but
were
i
known
to
her
majesty
and
the
lords
observe
me
i
would
undertake
upon
this
poor
head
and
life
for
the
public
benefit
of
the
state
not
only
to
spare
the
entire
lives
of
her
subjects
in
general
but
to
save
the
one
half
nay
three
parts
of
her
yearly
charge
in
holding
war
and
against
what
enemy
soever
and
how
would
i
do
it
think
you
edward
knowell
nay
i
know
not
nor
can
i
conceive
bobadill
why
thus
sir
i
would
select
nineteen
more
to
myself
throughout
the
land
gentlemen
they
should
be
of
good
spirit
strong
and
able
constitution
i
would
choose
them
by
an
instinct
a
character
that
i
have
and
i
would
teach
these
nineteen
the
special
rules
as
your
punto
your
reverso
your
stoccata
your
imbroccata
your
passada
your
montanto
till
they
could
all
play
very
near
or
altogether
as
well
as
myself
this
done
say
the
enemy
were
forty
thousand
strong
we
twenty
would
come
into
the
field
the
tenth
of
march
or
thereabouts
and
we
would
challenge
twenty
of
the
enemy
they
could
not
in
their
honour
refuse
us
well
we
would
kill
them
challenge
twenty
more
kill
them
twenty
more
kill
them
twenty
more
kill
them
too
and
thus
would
we
kill
every
man
his
twenty
a
day
that
twenty
score
twenty
score
that
two
hundred
two
hundred
a
day
five
days
a
thousand
forty
thousand
forty
times
five
five
times
forty
two
hundred
days
kills
them
all
up
by
computation
and
this
will
i
venture
by
poor
carcase
to
perform
provided
there
be
no
treason
practised
upon
us
by
fair
and
discreet
manhood
that
is
civilly
by
the
sword
edward
knowell
why
are
you
so
sure
of
your
hand
captain
at
all
times
bobadill
tut
never
miss
thrust
upon
my
reputation
with
you
edward
knowell
i
would
not
stand
in
downright
state
then
an
you
meet
him
for
the
wealth
of
any
one
street
in
london
and
the
following
are
names
of
various
passes
and
thrusts
used
in
fencing
punto
is
a
direct
hit
reverso
a
backward
blow
and
so
on
knowell
says
this
because
bobadill
and
downright
have
had
a
quarrel
and
downright
wishes
to
fight
the
captain
bobadill
why
sir
you
mistake
me
if
he
were
here
now
by
this
welkin
i
would
not
draw
my
weapon
on
him

other
but
say

were
bound
to
the
peace
the
law

poor
excuse

not
tell
sir
i
desire
good
construction
in
fair
sort
i
never
sustained
the
like
disgrace
by
heaven
sure
i
was
struck
with
a
planet
thence
for
i
had
no
power
to
touch
my
weapon
edward
knowell
ay
like
enough
i
have
heard
of
many
that
have
been
beaten
under
a
planet
go
get
you
to
a
surgeon
and
these
be
your
tricks
your
passadoes
and
your
montantos
none
of
them
when
every
man
in
his
humour
was
acted
shakespeare
took
a
part
in
it
he
and
jonson
must
have
met
each
other
often
must
have
known
each
other
well
at
the
mermaid
tavern
all
the
wits
used
to
gather
for
there
was
a
kind
of
club
founded
by
sir
walter
raleigh
and
here
the
clever
men
of
the
day
met
to
smoke
and
talk
and
drink
not
a
little
and
among
all
the
clever
men
jonson
soon
came
to
be
acknowledged
as
the
king
and
leader
we
have
a
pleasant
picture
of
these
friendly
meetings
by
a
man
who
lived
then
many
were
the
he
says
betwixt
shakespeare
and
ben
jonson
which
two
i
behold
like
a
spanish
great
gallion
and
an
english
man
of
war
master
jonson
like
the
former
was
built
far
higher
in
learning
solid
but
slow
in
his
performances
shakespeare
with
the
english
man
of
war
lesser
in
bulk
but
lighter
in
sailing
could
turn
with
all
tides
tack
about
and
take
advantage
of
all
winds
by
the
quickness
of
his
wit
and
invention
fuller
worthies
another
writer
says
in
a
letter
to
ben
what
things
have
we
seen
done
at
the
mermaid
heard
words
that
have
been
so
nimble
and
so
full
of
subtile
flame
as
if
that
every
one
from
whence
they
came
had
meant
to
pit
his
whole
wit
in
a
jest
beaumont
letter
to
ben
jonson
and
so
we
get
a
picture
of
ben
lording
it
in
taverns
a
great
good
fellow
a
stout
fellow
he
rolls
his
huge
bulk
about
laying
down
the
law
so
the
years
went
on
big
ben
wrote
and
fought
quarreled
and
made
friends
drank
and
talked
living
always
on
the
verge
of
poverty
at
length
in
the
great
queen
elizabeth
died
and
james
of
scotland
came
to
the
english
throne
all
the
way
as
he
journeyed
he
was
greeted
with
rejoicing
there
were
everywhere
plays
and
feasts
given
in
his
honor
and
soon
after
he
arrived
in
london
a
masque
written
by
jonson
was
played
before
him
the
new
king
was
fond
of
such
entertainments
he
smiled
upon
master
ben
jonson
and
life
became
for
him
easier
and
brighter
but
shortly
after
this
jonson
with
two
others
wrote
a
play
in
which
some
things
were
said
against
the
scots
with
a
scottish
king
surrounded
by
scottish
lords
that
was
dangerous
all
three
soon
found
themselves
in
prison
and
came
near
losing
their
noses
and
ears
this
was
not
the
first
time
that
ben
had
been
in
prison
for
soon
after
every
man
in
his
humour
was
acted
he
quarreled
for
some
unknown
reason
with
another
actor
in
the
foolish
fashion
of
the
day
they
fought
a
duel
over
it
and
ben
killed
the
other
man
for
this
he
was
seized
and
put
in
prison
and
just
escaped
being
hanged
he
was
left
off
only
with
the
loss
of
all
his
goods
and
a
brand
on
the
left
thumb
now
once
more
jonson
escaped
when
he
was
set
free
his
friends
gave
a
great
feast
to
show
their
joy
but
ben
had
not
learned
his
lesson
and
at
least
once
again
he
found
himself
in
prison
because
of
something
he
had
written
but
in
spite
of
these
things
the
king
continued
to
smile
upon
ben
jonson
he
gave
him
a
pension
and
made
him
poet
laureate
and
it
was
now
that
he
began
to
write
the
masques
for
which
he
became
famous
these
masques
were
dainty
poetic
little
plays
written
for
the
court
and
often
acted
by
the
queen
and
her
ladies
there
was
much
singing
and
dancing
in
them
and
the
dresses
of
the
actors
were
gorgeous
beyond
description
and
besides
this
while
the
ordinary
stage
was
still
without
any
scenery
inigo
jones
the
greatest
architect
in
the
land
joined
ben
jonson
in
making
his
plays
splendid
by
inventing
scenery
for
them
this
scenery
was
beautiful
and
elaborate
and
was
sometimes
changed
two
or
three
times
during
the
play
one
of
these
plays
called
the
masque
of
blackness
was
acted
by
the
queen
and
her
ladies
in
and
when
we
read
the
description
of
the
scenery
it
makes
us
wonder
and
smile
too
at
the
remembrance
of
wall
and
the
man
in
the
moon
of
which
shakespeare
made
such
fun
a
few
years
earlier
and
of
which
you
will
read
in
a
midsummer
night
dream
besides
his
masques
jonson
wrote
two
tragedies
and
a
number
of
comedies
as
well
as
other
poems
but
for
a
great
part
of
his
life
the
part
that
must
have
been
the
easiest
and
brightest
he
wrote
masques
for
the
king
and
court
and
not
for
the
ordinary
stage
he
knew
his
own
power
in
this
kind
of
writing
well
and
he
was
not
modest
next
himself
he
said
only
fletcher
and
chapman
could
make
a
mask
he
found
too
good
friends
among
the
nobles
with
one
he
lived
for
five
years
another
gave
him
money
to
buy
books
and
his
library
became
his
great
joy
and
pride
of
ben
jonson
with
drummond
of
hawthornden
ben
jonson
traveled
too
for
a
time
he
traveled
in
france
with
sir
walter
raleigh
son
while
sir
walter
himself
was
shut
up
in
the
tower
but
jonson
most
famous
journey
is
his
walk
to
scotland
he
liked
to
believe
that
he
belonged
to
a
famous
border
family
and
wished
to
visit
the
land
of
his
forefathers
so
in
the
of
he
set
out
we
do
not
know
how
long
he
took
to
make
his
lengthy
walk
but
in
september
he
was
comfortably
settled
in
leith
being
worthily
entertained
by
all
the
greatest
and
most
learned
men
of
the
day
he
had
money
enough
for
all
his
wants
for
he
was
able
to
give
a
gold
piece
and
two
and
twenty
shillings
to
another
poet
less
well
off
than
himself
he
was
given
the
freedom
of
the
city
of
edinburgh
and
more
than
pounds
was
spent
on
a
great
feast
in
his
honor
about
christmas
he
went
to
pay
a
visit
to
a
scottish
poet
william
drummond
who
lived
in
a
beautiful
house
called
hawthornden
a
few
miles
from
edinburgh
there
he
stayed
two
or
three
weeks
during
which
time
he
and
his
host
had
many
a
long
talk
together
discussing
men
and
books
drummond
wrote
down
all
that
he
could
remember
of
these
talks
and
it
is
from
them
that
we
learn
a
good
deal
of
what
we
know
about
our
poet
a
good
deal
perhaps
not
to
his
credit
we
learn
from
them
that
he
was
vain
and
boastful
a
loud
talker
and
a
deep
drinker
yet
there
is
something
about
this
big
blustering
ben
that
we
can
not
help
but
like
in
january
sometime
jonson
set
his
face
homeward
and
reached
london
in
april
or
may
having
taken
nearly
a
year
to
pay
his
visit
he
must
have
been
pleased
with
his
journey
for
on
his
return
he
wrote
a
poem
about
scotland
nothing
of
it
has
come
down
to
us
however
except
one
line
in
which
he
calls
edinburgh
the
heart
of
scotland
britain
other
eye
the
years
passed
for
jonson
if
not
in
wealth
at
least
in
such
comfort
as
his
way
of
life
allowed
for
we
can
not
ever
think
of
him
as
happy
in
his
own
home
by
his
own
fireside
he
is
rather
a
king
in
clubland
spending
his
all
freely
and
taking
no
thought
for
the
morrow
but
in
king
james
died
and
although
the
new
king
charles
still
continued
the
poet
pension
his
tastes
were
different
from
those
of
his
father
and
jonson
found
himself
and
his
masques
neglected
his
health
began
to
fail
too
and
his
library
which
he
dearly
loved
was
burned
together
with
many
of
his
unpublished
manuscripts
and
so
he
fell
on
evil
days
forgotten
at
court
jonson
began
once
more
to
write
for
the
stage
but
now
that
he
had
to
write
for
bread
it
almost
seemed
as
if
his
pen
had
lost
its
charm
the
plays
he
wrote
added
nothing
to
his
fame
they
were
badly
received
and
so
at
last
in
trouble
for
bread
without
wife
or
child
to
comfort
him
he
died
on
august
he
was
buried
in
westminster
and
it
was
intended
to
raise
a
fine
tomb
over
his
grave
but
times
were
growing
troublous
and
the
monument
was
still
lacking
when
a
lover
of
the
poet
sir
john
young
of
great
milton
in
oxfordshire
came
to
do
honor
to
his
tomb
finding
it
unmarked
he
paid
a
workman
to
carve
above
the
poet
the
words
o
rare
ben
jonson
and
perhaps
these
simple
words
have
done
more
to
keep
alive
the
memory
of
the
poet
than
any
splendid
monument
could
have
done
chapter
xlix
jonson
the
sad
shepherd
although
ben
jonson
days
ended
sadly
although
his
later
plays
showed
failing
powers
he
left
behind
him
unfinished
a
masque
called
the
sad
shepherd
which
is
perhaps
more
beautiful
and
more
full
of
music
than
anything
he
ever
wrote
for
ben
charm
did
not
lie
in
the
music
of
his
words
but
in
the
strength
of
his
drawing
of
character
as
another
poet
has
said
of
him
ben
as
a
rule
a
rule
which
is
proved
by
the
exception
was
one
of
the
singers
who
could
not
sing
though
like
dryden
he
could
intone
most
admirably
the
sad
shepherd
is
a
tale
of
robin
hood
here
once
more
we
find
an
old
story
being
used
again
for
we
have
already
heard
of
robin
hood
in
the
ballads
robin
hood
makes
a
great
fest
to
all
the
shepherds
and
shepherdesses
round
about
all
are
glad
to
come
save
one
aeglamon
the
sad
shepherd
whose
love
earine
has
he
believes
been
drowned
but
later
in
the
play
we
learn
that
earine
is
not
dead
but
that
a
wicked
witch
mother
maudlin
has
enchanted
her
and
shut
her
up
in
a
tree
she
had
done
this
in
order
to
force
earine
to
give
up
aeglamon
her
true
lover
and
marry
her
own
wretched
son
lorel
when
the
play
begins
aeglamon
passes
over
the
stage
mourning
for
his
lost
love
here
she
was
wont
to
go
and
here
and
here
just
where
those
daisies
pinks
and
violets
grow
the
world
may
find
the
spring
by
following
her
for
other
print
her
airy
steps
left
her
treading
would
not
bend
a
blade
of
grass
or
shake
the
downy
from
his
stalk
but
like
the
soft
west
wind
she
shot
along
and
where
she
went
the
flowers
took
thickest
root
as
she
had
sowed
them
with
her
odorous
foot
robin
hood
has
left
maid
marian
friar
tuck
little
john
and
all
his
merry
men
to
hunt
the
deer
and
make
ready
the
feast
and
tuck
says
and
i
the
chaplain
here
am
left
to
be
steward
and
charge
you
all
in
fee
to
don
your
liveries
see
the
bower
dressed
and
fit
the
fine
devices
for
the
feast
so
some
make
ready
the
bower
the
tables
and
the
seats
while
maid
marian
little
john
and
others
set
out
to
hunt
presently
they
return
successful
having
killed
a
fine
stag
robin
too
comes
home
and
after
loving
greetings
listens
to
the
tale
of
the
hunt
then
marian
tells
how
when
the
huntsmen
cut
up
the
stag
they
threw
the
bone
called
the
raven
bone
to
one
that
sat
and
croaked
for
it
now
head
sat
a
raven
on
a
sere
bough
a
grown
great
bird
and
hoarse
who
all
the
while
the
deer
was
breaking
up
so
croaked
and
cried
for
it
as
all
the
huntsmen
especially
old
scathlock
thought
it
ominous
swore
it
was
mother
maudlin
whom
he
met
at
the
just
as
he
roused
the
deer
out
of
his
lair
mother
maudlin
was
a
retched
old
witch
and
scathlock
says
he
is
yet
more
sure
that
the
raven
was
she
because
in
her
own
form
he
has
just
seen
her
broiling
the
raven
bone
by
the
fire
sitting
in
the
within
while
the
talk
went
on
maid
marian
had
gone
away
now
she
returns
and
begins
to
quarrel
with
robin
hood
venison
is
much
too
good
for
such
folk
as
he
and
his
men
she
says
a
starved
mutton
carcase
would
better
fit
their
palates
and
she
orders
scathlock
to
take
the
venison
to
mother
maudlin
those
around
can
scarce
believe
their
ears
for
robin
and
his
marian
are
the
sum
and
talk
of
all
that
breathe
here
in
the
walk
such
is
their
love
for
each
other
they
are
the
turtles
of
the
wood
the
billing
pair
no
one
is
more
astonished
than
robin
hood
as
he
cries
i
dare
not
trust
the
faith
of
mine
own
senses
i
fear
mine
eyes
and
ears
this
is
not
marian
nor
am
i
robin
hood
i
pray
you
ask
her
ask
her
good
shepherds
ask
her
all
for
me
or
rather
ask
yourselves
if
she
be
she
or
i
be
i
but
maid
marian
only
scolds
the
more
and
at
last
goes
away
leaving
the
others
in
sad
bewilderment
of
course
this
was
not
maid
marian
at
all
but
mother
maudlin
the
old
witch
who
had
taken
her
form
in
order
to
make
mischief
meanwhile
the
real
maid
marian
discovers
that
the
venison
has
been
sent
away
to
mother
maudlin
with
tears
in
her
eyes
she
declares
that
she
gave
no
such
orders
and
scathlock
is
sent
to
bring
it
back
when
mother
maudlin
comes
to
thank
maid
marian
for
her
present
she
is
told
that
no
such
present
was
ever
intended
and
so
she
in
anger
curses
the
cook
casting
spells
upon
him
the
spit
stand
still
no
broches
turn
before
the
fire
but
let
it
burn
both
sides
and
haunches
till
the
whole
converted
be
into
one
coal
the
pain
we
call
anton

the
gout
or
what
we
can
desire
to
cramp
a
cook
in
every
limb
before
they
dine
yet
seize
on
him
soon
friar
tuck
comes
in
hear
you
how
he
says
poor
tom
the
cook
is
taken
all
his
joints
do
crack
as
if
his
limbs
were
tied
with
points
his
whole
frame
slackens
and
a
kind
of
rack
runs
down
along
the
spindils
of
his
back
a
gout
or
cramp
now
seizeth
on
his
head
then
falls
into
his
feet
his
knees
are
lead
and
he
can
stir
his
either
hand
no
more
than
a
dead
stump
to
his
office
as
before
he
is
bewitched
that
is
certain
and
certain
too
it
is
that
mother
maudlin
has
done
it
so
robin
and
his
men
set
out
to
hunt
for
her
while
friar
tuck
and
much
the
miller
son
stay
to
look
after
the
dinner
in
the
poor
cook
stead
robin
soon
meets
mother
maudlin
who
has
again
taken
the
form
of
maid
marian
but
this
time
robin
suspects
her
he
seizes
the
witch
by
her
enchanted
belt
it
breaks
and
she
comes
back
to
her
own
shape
and
robin
goes
off
leaving
her
cursing
mother
maudlin
then
calls
for
her
goblin
he
appears
crying
at
your
beck

but
pays

be

pull

lucky
my

and
here
the
play
breaks
off
suddenly
for
jonson
died
and
left
it
so
it
was
finished
by
another
later
on
but
with
none
of
jonson
skill
and
reading
the
continuation
we
feel
that
all
the
interest
is
gone
however
you
will
be
glad
to
know
that
everything
comes

chapter
l
raleigh
the
revenge
some
of
you
may
have
seen
a
picture
of
a
sailor
sitting
by
the
seashore
telling
stories
of
travel
and
adventure
to
two
boy
the
one
boy
lies
upon
the
sand
with
his
chin
in
his
hands
listening
but
carelessly
the
other
with
his
hands
clasped
about
his
knees
listens
eagerly
his
face
is
rapt
his
eyes
the
eyes
of
a
poet
and
a
dreamer
this
picture
is
called
the
boyhood
of
raleigh
and
was
painted
by
one
of
our
great
painters
sir
john
millais
in
it
he
pictures
a
scene
that
we
should
like
to
believe
was
common
in
sir
walter
raleigh
boyhood
but
we
can
not
tell
if
it
were
really
so
or
not
beyond
the
fact
that
he
was
born
in
a
farmhouse
near
budleigh
salterton
in
devonshire
about
the
year
we
know
nothing
of
raleigh
childhood
but
from
the
rising
ground
near
hayes
barton
the
house
in
which
he
was
born
we
catch
sight
of
the
sea
it
seems
not
too
much
to
believe
that
many
a
time
walter
and
his
brother
carew
wandered
through
the
woods
and
over
the
common
the
two
and
a
half
miles
to
the
bay
so
that
from
his
earliest
days
walter
raleigh
breathed
in
a
love
and
knowledge
of
the
sea
we
like
to
think
these
things
but
we
can
only
make
believe
to
ourselves
as
millais
did
when
he
went
to
budleigh
salterton
and
painted
that
picture
when
still
quite
a
boy
walter
raleigh
went
to
oriel
college
oxford
but
we
know
nothing
of
what
he
did
there
and
the
next
we
hear
of
him
is
that
he
is
fighting
for
the
huguenots
in
france
how
long
he
remained
in
france
and
what
he
did
there
beyond
this
fighting
we
do
not
know
but
this
we
know
that
when
he
went
to
france
he
was
a
mere
boy
with
no
knowledge
of
fighting
no
knowledge
of
the
world
when
he
left
he
was
a
man
and
a
tried
soldier
a
captain
and
leader
of
men
when
next
we
hear
of
raleigh
he
is
in
ireland
fighting
the
rebels
there
he
did
some
brave
deeds
some
cruel
deeds
there
he
lived
to
the
full
the
life
of
a
soldier
as
it
was
in
those
rough
times
making
all
ireland
ring
with
his
name
but
although
raleigh
had
won
for
himself
a
name
among
soldiers
he
was
as
yet
unknown
to
the
queen
his
fortune
was
still
unmade
you
have
all
heard
the
story
of
how
raleigh
first
met
the
queen
the
first
notice
we
have
of
this
story
is
in
a
book
from
which
i
have
already
quoted
more
than
once
the
worthies
of
england
this
captain
raleigh
says
fuller
coming
out
of
ireland
to
the
english
court
in
good
habit
his
clothes
being
then
a
considerable
part
of
his
estate
found
the
queen
walking
till
meeting
with
a
splashy
place
she
seemed
to
scruple
going
thereon
presently
raleigh
cast
and
spread
his
new
plush
cloak
on
the
ground
whereon
the
queen
trod
gently
rewarding
him
afterwards
with
many
suits
for
his
so
free
and
seasonable
tender
of
so
fair
a
foot
cloth
thomas
fuller
who
wrote
the
book
in
which
this
story
is
found
was
only
a
boy
of
ten
when
raleigh
died
so
he
could
not
have
known
the
great
man
himself
but
he
must
have
heard
many
stories
about
him
from
those
who
had
and
we
need
not
disbelieve
this
one
it
is
one
of
those
things
which
might
very
well
have
happened
even
if
it
did
not
and
whether
raleigh
first
came
into
queen
elizabeth
notice
in
this
manner
or
not
after
he
did
become
known
to
her
he
soon
rose
in
her
favor
he
rose
so
quickly
that
he
almost
feared
the
giddy
height
to
which
he
rose
according
to
another
story
of
fuller
this
made
him
write
in
a
glasse
window
obvious
to
the
queen
eye
would
i
climb
yet
fear
i
to
fall
her
majesty
either
espying
or
being
shown
it
did
underwrite
thy
heart
fails
thee
climb
not
at
all
however
he
at
last
climbed
up
by
the
stairs
of
his
own
desert
honors
and
favors
were
heaped
upon
raleigh
and
from
being
a
poor
soldier
and
country
gentleman
he
became
rich
and
powerful
the
lord
of
lands
in
five
counties
and
captain
of
the
queen
own
haughty
of
manner
splendid
in
dress
loving
jewels
more
than
even
a
woman
does
raleigh
became
as
fine
a
courtier
as
he
was
a
brave
soldier
but
soldier
though
raleigh
was
courtier
though
he
was
loving
ease
and
wealth
and
fine
clothes
he
was
at
heart
a
sailor
and
adventurer
and
the
sea
he
had
loved
as
a
boy
called
to
him
like
many
another
of
his
age
raleigh
hearing
the
call
of
the
waves
ever
in
his
ears
felt
the
desire
to
explore
tug
at
his
for
in
those
days
america
had
been
discovered
and
the
quest
for
the
famous
passage
had
begun
and
raleigh
longed
to
set
forth
with
other
men
to
conquer
new
worlds
to
find
new
paths
across
the
waves
but
above
all
he
longed
to
fight
the
spaniards
who
were
the
great
sea
kings
of
those
days
raleigh
however
could
not
be
a
courtier
and
a
sailor
at
one
and
the
same
time
he
was
meanwhile
high
in
the
queen
favor
and
she
would
not
let
him
go
from
her
so
all
that
raleigh
could
do
was
to
venture
his
money
and
fit
out
a
ship
to
which
he
gave
his
own
name
this
he
sent
to
sail
along
with
others
under
the
command
of
his
sir
humphrey
gilbert
who
was
setting
out
upon
a
voyage
of
discovery
it
was
on
this
voyage
that
sir
humphrey
found
and
claimed
newfoundland
as
an
english
possession
setting
up
there
the
arms
of
england
ingraven
in
lead
and
infixed
upon
a
pillar
of
wood
but
the
expedition
was
unfortunate
most
of
the
men
and
ships
were
lost
sir
humphrey
himself
being
drowned
on
his
way
home
he
was
brave
and
fearless
to
the
last
we
are
as
near
to
heaven
by
sea
as
by
land
he
said
a
short
time
before
his
ship
went
down
one
vessel
only
in
great
torment
of
weather
and
peril
of
drowning
reached
home
safely
all
the
men
tired
with
the
tediousness
of
so
unprofitable
a
voyage
to
their
seeming
yet
though
they
knew
it
not
they
had
helped
to
lay
the
foundation
of
greater
britain
voyages
nothing
daunted
by
this
loss
six
months
later
raleigh
sent
out
another
expedition
this
time
it
was
to
the
land
south
of
newfoundland
that
the
ships
took
their
way
there
they
set
up
the
arms
of
england
and
named
the
new
possession
virginia
in
honor
of
the
virgin
queen
this
expedition
was
little
more
successful
than
sir
humphrey
gilbert
but
nothing
seemed
to
discourage
raleigh
he
was
bent
on
founding
a
colony
and
again
and
yet
again
he
sent
out
ships
and
men
spending
all
the
wealth
which
the
queen
heaped
upon
him
in
trying
to
extend
her
dominions
beyond
the
seas
hope
was
strong
within
him
i
shall
yet
live
to
see
it
an
english
nation
he
said
and
while
raleigh
captains
tried
to
found
a
new
england
in
the
new
world
raleigh
himself
worked
at
home
to
bring
order
into
the
vast
estates
the
queen
had
given
to
him
in
ireland
this
land
had
belonged
to
the
rebel
earl
of
desmond
at
one
time
no
doubt
it
had
been
fertile
but
rebellion
and
war
had
laid
it
waste
the
land
was
so
barren
both
of
man
and
beast
that
whosoever
did
travel
from
one
end
of
all
munster
he
should
not
meet
man
woman
or
child
saving
in
cities
or
towns
nor
yet
see
any
beast
save
foxes
wolves
or
the
ravening
beasts
and
barren
and
desolate
as
it
was
when
raleigh
received
it
it
soon
became
known
as
the
best
tilled
land
in
all
the
for
he
brought
workers
and
tenants
from
his
old
devon
home
to
take
the
place
of
the
beggared
or
slain
irish
he
introduced
new
and
better
ways
of
tilling
and
also
he
brought
to
ireland
a
strange
new
root
for
it
is
interesting
to
remember
that
it
was
in
raleigh
irish
estates
that
potatoes
were
first
grown
in
our
islands
raleigh
took
a
great
interest
in
these
estates
so
perhaps
it
was
not
altogether
a
hardship
to
him
finding
himself
out
of
favor
with
his
queen
to
go
to
ireland
for
a
time
and
although
they
had
known
each
other
before
it
was
then
that
his
friendship
with
spenser
began
spenser
read
his
faery
queen
to
raleigh
and
perhaps
raleigh
read
to
spenser
his
poem
cynthia
written
in
honor
of
queen
elizabeth
but
of
that
poem
nearly
all
has
been
lost
elizabeth
was
not
as
yet
very
angry
with
raleigh
still
he
felt
the
loss
of
her
favor
for
spenser
tells
us
his
song
was
all
a
lamentable
lay
of
great
unkindness
and
of
usage
hard
of
cynthia
the
lady
of
the
sea
which
from
her
presence
faultless
him
debarred
and
ever
and
anon
with
rife
he
criéd
out
to
make
his
undersong
my
love
queen
and
goddess
of
my
life
who
shall
me
pity
when
thou
doest
me
wrong
colin
clout
come
home
again
but
raleigh
soon
decided
to
return
to
court
and
persuaded
spenser
to
wend
with
him
his
cynthia
to
see
whose
grace
was
great
and
bounty
most
rewardful
clout
you
know
how
spenser
was
received
and
how
he
fared
but
raleigh
himself
after
he
had
introduced
his
friend
did
not
stay
long
at
court
quarrels
with
his
rivals
soon
drove
him
forth
again
it
was
soon
after
this
that
he
published
the
first
writing
which
gives
him
a
claim
to
the
name
of
author
this
was
an
account
of
the
fight
between
a
little
ship
called
the
revenge
and
a
spanish
fleet
although
with
the
destruction
of
the
invincible
armada
the
sea
power
of
spain
had
been
crippled
it
had
not
been
utterly
broken
and
still
whenever
spanish
and
english
ships
met
on
the
seas
there
was
sure
to
be
battle
it
being
known
that
a
fleet
of
spanish
would
pass
the
azores
islands
in
the
atlantic
a
fleet
of
english
ships
under
lord
thomas
howard
was
sent
to
attack
them
but
the
english
ships
had
to
wait
so
long
at
the
azores
for
the
coming
of
the
spanish
fleet
that
the
news
of
the
intended
attack
reached
spain
and
the
spaniards
sent
a
strong
fleet
to
help
and
protect
their
the
english
in
turn
hearing
of
this
sent
a
swift
little
boat
to
warn
lord
thomas
the
warning
arrived
almost
too
late
many
of
the
englishmen
were
sick
and
ashore
and
before
all
could
be
gathered
the
fleet
of
great
spanish
ships
was
upon
them
still
lord
thomas
managed
to
slip
away
only
the
last
ship
the
revenge
commanded
by
the
sir
richard
grenville
lost
the
wind
and
was
caught
between
two
great
squadrons
of
the
spanish
whereupon
sir
richard
was
persuaded
sir
walter
says
by
the
master
and
others
to
cut
his
and
cast
about
and
to
trust
to
the
sailing
of
the
ship
but
sir
richard
utterly
refused
to
turn
from
the
enemy
alleging
that
he
would
rather
choose
to
die
than
to
dishonour
himself
his
country
and
her
majesty
ship
persuading
his
company
that
he
would
pass
through
the
two
squadrons
in
despite
of
them
for
a
little
time
it
seemed
as
if
sir
richard
daring
might
succeed
but
a
great
ship
the
san
philip
came
between
him
and
the
wind
and
coming
towards
him
becalmed
his
sails
in
such
sort
as
the
ship
could
neither
make
way
nor
feel
the
helm
so
huge
and
was
the
spanish
ship
the
fight
thus
beginning
at
three
of
the
clock
of
the
afternoon
continued
very
terrible
all
that
evening
but
the
great
san
philip
having
received
the
lower
tier
of
the
revenge
discharged
with
shot
shifted
herself
with
all
diligence
from
her
sides
utterly
misliking
her
first
entertainment
the
spanish
ships
were
filled
with
companies
of
soldiers
in
some
two
hundred
besides
the
mariners
in
some
five
in
other
eight
hundred
in
ours
there
were
none
at
all
beside
the
mariners
but
the
servants
of
the
commanders
and
some
few
voluntary
gentlemen
only
and
yet
the
spaniards
were
still
repulsed
again
and
again
and
at
all
times
beaten
back
into
their
own
ships
or
into
the
seas
meaning
of
the
word
is
uncertain
it
may
be
in
the
beginning
of
the
fight
one
little
store
ship
of
the
english
fleet
hovered
near
it
was
small
and
of
no
use
in
fighting
now
it
came
close
to
the
revenge
and
the
captain
asked
sir
richard
what
he
should
do
and
sir
richard
bid
him
save
himself
and
leave
him
to
his
fortune
so
the
gallant
revenge
was
left
to
fight
alone
for
fifteen
hours
the
battle
lasted
sir
richard
himself
was
sorely
wounded
and
when
far
into
the
night
the
fighting
ceased
two
of
the
spanish
vessels
were
sunk
and
in
many
other
of
the
spanish
ships
great
slaughter
was
made
but
the
spanish
ships
which
attempted
to
board
the
revenge
as
they
were
wounded
and
beaten
off
so
always
others
came
in
their
places
she
having
never
less
than
two
might
galleons
by
her
sides
and
aboard
her
so
that
ere
the
morning
from
three
of
the
clock
the
day
before
there
had
fifteen
several
assailed
her
and
all
so
ill
approved
their
entertainment
as
they
were
by
the
break
of
day
far
more
willing
to
hearken
to
a
than
hastily
to
make
any
more
assaults
or
entries
here
means
merely
a
spanish
ship
of
war
arrangement
to
cease
fighting
on
both
sides
but
as
the
day
increased
so
our
men
decreased
and
as
the
light
grew
more
and
more
by
so
much
more
grew
our
discomforts
for
none
appeared
in
sight
but
enemies
saving
one
small
ship
called
the
pilgrim
commanded
by
jacob
whiddon
who
hovered
all
night
to
see
the
success
but
in
the
morning
bearing
with
the
revenge
she
was
hunted
like
a
hare
amongst
many
ravenous
hounds
but
escaped
all
the
powder
of
the
revenge
to
the
last
barrel
was
now
spent
all
her
pikes
broken
forty
of
her
best
men
slain
and
the
most
part
of
the
rest
hurt
in
the
beginning
of
the
fight
she
had
but
one
hundred
free
from
sickness
and
four
score
and
ten
sick
laid
in
hold
upon
the
ballast
a
small
troop
to
man
such
a
ship
and
a
weak
garrison
to
resist
so
mighty
an
army
by
those
hundred
all
was
sustained
the
volleys
boarding
and
enterings
of
fifteen
ships
of
war
besides
those
which
beat
her
at
large
on
the
contrary
the
spanish
were
always
supplied
with
soldiers
brought
from
every
squadron
all
manner
of
arms
and
power
at
will
unto
ours
there
remained
no
comfort
at
all
no
hope
no
supply
either
of
ships
men
or
weapons
the
masts
all
beaten
overboard
all
her
tackle
cut
asunder
her
upper
work
altogether
razed
and
in
effect
evened
she
was
with
the
water
but
the
very
foundation
of
a
ship
nothing
being
left
overhead
for
flight
or
defence
sir
richard
finding
himself
in
this
distress
and
unable
any
longer
to
make
resistance
having
endured
in
this
fifteen
fight
the
assault
of
fifteen
several
armadas
all
by
turns
aboard
him
and
by
estimation
eight
hundred
shot
of
great
artillery
besides
many
assaults
and
entries
and
seeing
that
himself
and
the
ship
must
needs
be
possessed
of
the
enemy
who
were
now
all
cast
in
a
ring
round
about
him
the
revenge
not
able
to
move
one
way
or
another
but
as
she
was
moved
by
the
waves
and
billow
of
the
sea
commanded
the
master
gunner
whom
he
knew
to
be
a
most
resolute
man
to
split
and
sink
the
ship
that
thereby
nothing
might
remain
of
glory
or
victory
to
the
spaniards
seeing
in
so
many
hours
fight
and
with
so
great
a
navy
they
were
not
able
to
take
her
having
had
fifteen
hours
time
above
ten
thousand
men
and
fifty
and
three
sail
of
men
of
war
to
perform
it
withal
and
he
persuaded
the
company
or
as
many
as
he
could
induce
to
yield
themselves
unto
god
and
to
the
mercy
of
none
else
but
as
they
had
like
valiant
resolute
men
repulsed
so
many
enemies
they
should
not
now
shorten
the
honour
of
their
nation
by
prolonging
their
own
lives
by
a
few
hours
or
a
few
days
the
master
gunner
readily
condescended
and
divers
others
but
the
captain
and
the
master
were
of
another
opinion
and
besought
sir
richard
to
have
care
of
them
alleging
that
the
spaniard
would
be
as
ready
to
entertain
a
composition
as
they
were
willing
to
offer
the
same
and
they
said
that
there
being
divers
sufficient
and
valiant
men
yet
living
and
whose
wounds
were
not
mortal
they
might
do
their
country
and
their
prince
acceptable
service
hereafter
and
whereas
sir
richard
alleged
that
the
spaniards
should
never
glory
to
have
taken
one
ship
of
her
majesty
seeing
they
had
so
long
and
so
notably
defended
themselves
they
answered
that
the
ship
had
six
foot
water
in
hold
three
shot
under
water
which
were
so
weakly
stopped
as
with
the
first
working
of
the
sea
she
must
needs
sink
and
was
besides
so
crushed
and
bruised
as
she
could
never
be
removed
out
of
the
place
and
as
the
matter
was
thus
in
dispute
and
sir
richard
refusing
to
hearken
to
any
of
those
reasons
the
master
of
the
revenge
while
the
captain
won
unto
him
the
greater
party
was
convoyed
aboard
the
general
don
alfonso
bacan
who
finding
none
overhasty
to
enter
the
revenge
again
doubting
lest
sir
richard
would
have
blown
them
up
and
himself
and
perceiving
by
the
report
of
the
master
of
the
revenge
his
dangerous
disposition
yielded
that
all
their
lives
should
be
saved
the
company
sent
for
england
and
the
better
sort
to
pay
such
reasonable
ransom
as
their
estate
would
bear
and
in
the
mean
season
to
be
free
from
galley
or
imprisonment
to
this
he
so
much
the
better
condescended
as
well
as
i
have
said
for
fear
of
further
loss
and
mischief
to
themselves
as
also
for
the
desire
he
had
to
recover
sir
richard
grenville
whom
for
his
notable
valour
he
seemed
greatly
to
honour
and
admire
when
this
answer
was
returned
and
that
safety
of
life
was
promised
the
common
sort
being
now
at
the
end
of
their
peril
the
most
drew
back
from
sir
richard
and
the
master
gunner
it
being
no
hard
matter
to
dissuade
men
from
death
to
life
the
master
gunner
finding
himself
and
sir
richard
thus
prevented
and
mastered
by
the
greater
number
would
have
slain
himself
with
a
sword
had
he
not
been
by
force
and
locked
into
his
cabin
then
the
general
sent
many
boats
aboard
the
revenge
and
divers
of
our
men
fearing
sir
richard
disposition
stole
away
aboard
the
general
and
other
ships
sir
richard
thus
matched
was
sent
unto
by
alfonso
bacan
to
remove
out
of
the
revenge
the
ship
being
marvellous
unsavoury
filled
with
blood
and
bodies
of
dead
and
wounded
men
like
a
slaughterhouse
sir
richard
answered
he
might
do
with
his
body
what
he
list
for
he
esteemed
it
not
and
as
he
was
carried
out
of
the
ship
he
swooned
and
reviving
again
desired
the
company
to
pray
for
him
the
general
used
sir
richard
with
all
humanity
and
left
nothing
unattempted
that
tended
to
his
recovery
highly
commending
his
valour
and
worthiness
and
greatly
bewailing
the
danger
in
which
he
was
being
unto
them
a
rare
spectacle
and
a
resolution
seldom
approved
to
see
one
ship
turn
toward
so
many
enemies
to
endure
the
charge
and
boarding
of
so
many
huge
armadas
and
to
resist
and
repel
the
assaults
and
entries
of
so
many
soldiers
there
were
slain
and
drowned
in
this
fight
well
near
one
thousand
of
the
enemies
and
two
special
commanders
besides
divers
others
of
special
account
sir
richard
died
as
it
is
said
the
second
or
third
day
aboard
the
general
and
was
by
them
greatly
bewailed
what
became
of
his
body
whether
it
were
buried
in
the
sea
or
on
the
land
we
known
not
the
comfort
that
remaineth
to
his
friends
is
that
he
hath
ended
his
life
honourably
in
respect
of
the
reputation
won
to
his
nation
and
country
and
of
the
same
to
his
posterity
and
that
being
dead
he
hath
not
outlived
his
own
honour
this
gallant
fight
of
the
little
revenge
against
the
huge
navy
of
spain
is
one
of
the
great
things
in
the
story
of
the
sea
that
is
why
i
have
chosen
it
out
of
all
that
sir
walter
wrote
to
give
you
as
a
specimen
of
english
prose
in
queen
elizabeth
time
as
long
as
brave
deeds
are
remembered
it
will
be
told
how
sir
richard
grenville
walled
round
with
wooden
castles
on
the
wave
bid
defiance
to
the
might
and
pride
of
spain
hoping
the
splendour
of
some
lucky
star
the
fight
was
a
hopeless
one
from
the
very
beginning
but
it
was
as
gallant
a
one
as
ever
took
place
even
his
foes
were
forced
to
admire
sir
dauntless
courage
for
when
he
was
carried
aboard
don
ship
the
captain
and
gentlemen
went
to
visit
him
and
to
comfort
him
in
his
hard
fortune
wondering
at
his
courageous
stout
heart
for
that
he
showed
not
any
sign
of
faintness
nor
changing
of
colour
but
feeling
the
hour
of
death
to
approach
he
spake
these
words
in
spanish
and
said
die
i
richard
grenville
with
a
joyful
and
quiet
mind
for
that
i
have
ended
my
life
as
a
true
soldier
ought
to
do
and
hath
fought
for
his
country
queen
religion
and
honour
whereby
my
soul
most
joyfully
departeth
out
of
this
body
and
shall
always
leave
behind
it
an
everlasting
fame
of
a
valiant
and
true
soldier
that
hath
done
his
duty
as
he
was
bound
to
do
when
he
had
finished
these
or
other
like
words
he
gave
up
the
ghost
with
great
and
stout
courage
and
no
man
could
perceive
any
true
signs
of
heaviness
in
him
markham
large
testimony
in
hakluyt
voyages
poets
of
the
time
made
ballads
of
this
fight
raleigh
wrote
of
it
as
you
have
just
read
and
in
our
own
day
the
great
laureate
lord
tennyson
made
the
story
live
again
in
his
poem
the
revenge
tennyson
tells
how
after
the
fight
a
great
storm
arose
and
or
ever
that
evening
ended
a
great
gale
blew
and
a
wave
like
the
wave
that
is
raised
by
an
earthquake
grew
till
it
smote
on
their
hulls
and
their
sails
and
their
masts
and
their
flags
and
the
whole
sea
plunged
and
fell
on
the
navy
of
spain
and
the
little
revenge
herself
went
down
by
the
island
crags
to
be
lost
evermore
in
the
main
so
neither
the
gallant
captain
nor
his
little
ship
were
led
home
to
the
triumph
of
spain
it
is
interesting
to
remember
that
had
it
not
been
for
the
caprice
of
the
queen
raleigh
himself
would
have
been
in
sir
richard
grenville
place
for
he
had
orders
to
go
on
this
voyage
but
at
the
last
moment
he
was
recalled
and
sir
richard
was
sent
instead
chapter
li
raleigh
the
history
of
the
world
soon
after
the
fight
with
the
revenge
the
king
of
spain
made
ready
more
ships
to
attack
england
raleigh
then
persuaded
queen
elizabeth
that
it
would
be
well
to
be
before
hand
with
the
spaniards
and
attack
their
ships
at
panama
so
to
this
end
a
fleet
was
gathered
together
but
the
queen
sent
only
two
ships
various
gentlemen
provided
others
and
raleigh
spent
every
penny
of
his
own
that
he
could
gather
in
fitting
out
the
remainder
he
was
himself
chosen
admiral
of
the
fleet
so
at
length
he
started
on
an
expedition
after
his
own
heart
but
he
had
not
gone
far
when
a
swift
messenger
was
sent
to
him
ordering
him
to
return
unwillingly
he
obeyed
and
when
he
reached
home
he
was
at
once
sent
to
the
tower
a
prisoner
this
time
the
queen
was
really
angry
with
him
in
her
eyes
crime
was
a
deep
one
for
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
one
of
her
own
maids
of
honor
mistress
elizabeth
throgmorton
and
the
queen
had
discovered
it
elizabeth
allowed
none
of
her
favorites
to
love
any
one
but
herself
so
she
punished
raleigh
by
sending
him
to
the
tower
mistress
throgmorton
was
also
made
a
prisoner
after
a
time
however
both
prisoners
were
set
free
though
they
were
banished
from
court
they
married
and
went
to
live
at
sherborne
where
raleigh
busied
himself
improving
his
beautiful
house
and
laying
out
the
garden
for
though
set
free
raleigh
was
still
in
disgrace
but
we
may
believe
that
he
found
some
recompense
for
his
queen
anger
in
his
wife
love
in
his
wife
raleigh
found
a
comrade
through
all
good
and
evil
fortune
she
stood
by
him
she
shared
his
hopes
and
desires
she
sold
her
lands
to
give
him
money
for
his
voyages
she
shared
imprisonment
with
him
when
it
came
again
and
after
his
death
she
never
ceased
to
mourn
his
loss
how
raleigh
loved
her
in
return
we
learn
from
the
few
letters
written
to
her
which
have
come
down
to
us
she
is
sweetheart
dearest
bess
and
he
tells
to
her
his
troubles
and
his
hopes
as
to
a
staunch
and
true
friend
we
can
not
follow
raleigh
through
all
his
restless
life
it
was
so
full
and
varied
that
the
story
of
it
would
fill
a
long
book
he
loved
fighting
and
adventure
he
loved
books
too
and
soon
we
find
him
back
in
london
meeting
ben
jonson
and
shakespeare
and
all
the
great
writers
of
the
age
at
the
mermaid
club
for
raleigh
knew
all
the
great
men
of
his
day
among
them
sir
robert
bruce
cotton
of
whom
you
heard
in
connection
with
the
adventures
of
the
beowulf
manuscript
but
soon
in
spite
of
his
love
for
his
wife
in
spite
of
his
interest
in
his
beautiful
home
in
spite
of
his
many
friends
raleigh
restless
spirit
again
drove
him
to
the
sea
and
he
set
out
on
a
voyage
of
discovery
and
adventure
this
time
he
sailed
to
guiana
in
south
america
in
search
of
eldorado
the
fabled
city
of
gold
and
this
time
he
was
not
called
back
by
the
queen
but
although
he
reached
south
america
and
sailed
up
the
orinoco
and
the
caroni
he
returned
a
beggar
and
withered
without
having
found
the
fabled
city
yet
his
belief
in
it
was
as
strong
as
ever
he
had
not
found
the
fabled
city
but
he
believed
it
was
to
be
found
and
when
he
came
home
he
wrote
an
account
of
his
journey
because
some
of
his
enemies
said
that
he
had
never
been
to
guiana
at
all
but
had
been
hiding
in
cornwall
all
the
time
in
this
book
he
said
that
he
was
ready
again
to
lie
hard
to
fare
worse
to
be
subjected
to
perils
to
diseases
to
ill
savours
to
be
parched
and
withered
if
in
the
end
he
might
succeed
discovery
of
guiana
raleigh
was
ready
to
set
off
again
at
once
to
discover
more
of
guiana
but
instead
he
joined
the
fleet
and
went
to
fight
the
spanish
who
were
once
more
threatening
england
and
of
all
enemies
raleigh
considered
the
spaniards
the
greatest
once
again
the
english
won
a
splendid
victory
over
spain
before
the
town
of
cadiz
eight
english
ships
captured
or
destroyed
thirty
spanish
great
and
little
they
took
the
town
of
cadiz
and
razed
its
fortifications
to
the
ground
raleigh
bore
himself
well
in
this
fight
so
well
indeed
that
even
his
rival
essex
was
bound
to
confess
that
which
he
did
in
the
could
not
be
bettered
and
now
after
five
years
banishment
from
the
queen
favor
raleigh
was
once
more
received
at
court
but
we
can
not
follow
all
the
ups
and
downs
of
his
court
life
for
we
are
told
sir
walter
raleigh
was
in
and
out
at
court
so
often
that
he
was
commonly
called
the
tennis
ball
of
fortune
and
so
the
years
went
on
raleigh
became
a
member
of
parliament
and
was
made
governor
of
jersey
he
fought
and
traveled
attended
to
his
estates
in
ireland
to
his
business
in
cornwall
to
his
governorship
in
jersey
he
led
a
stirring
busy
life
fulfilling
his
many
duties
fighting
his
enemies
until
in
the
great
queen
whose
smile
or
frown
had
meant
so
much
to
him
died
then
soon
after
the
new
king
came
to
the
throne
it
was
seen
that
raleigh
day
at
court
was
indeed
at
an
end
for
james
had
been
told
that
sir
walter
was
among
those
who
were
unwilling
to
receive
him
as
king
therefore
he
was
little
disposed
to
look
graciously
on
the
handsome
daring
one
by
one
raleigh
posts
of
honor
were
taken
from
him
he
was
accused
of
treason
and
once
more
found
himself
a
prisoner
in
the
tower
he
was
tried
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
nothing
was
proved
against
him
he
was
condemned
to
die
the
sentence
was
changed
however
to
imprisonment
for
life
raleigh
was
not
left
quite
lonely
in
the
tower
his
wife
and
children
whom
he
dearly
loved
were
allowed
to
come
to
live
beside
him
the
governor
was
kind
to
him
and
allowed
his
renowned
prisoner
to
use
his
garden
and
there
in
a
little
house
raleigh
amused
himself
by
making
experiments
in
chemistry
and
discovering
among
other
things
how
to
distill
fresh
water
from
salt
water
he
found
new
friends
too
in
the
queen
and
in
her
young
son
henry
prince
of
wales
it
was
a
strange
friendship
and
a
warm
one
that
grew
between
the
gallant
prince
of
ten
and
the
tried
man
of
fifty
prince
henry
loved
to
visit
raleigh
in
the
tower
and
listen
to
the
tales
of
his
brave
doings
by
sea
and
land
in
the
days
when
he
was
free
raleigh
helped
prince
henry
to
build
a
model
ship
and
the
prince
asked
raleigh
advice
and
talked
over
with
him
all
his
troubles
his
generous
young
heart
grieved
at
the
though
of
his
misfortunes
who
but
my
father
would
keep
such
a
bird
in
such
a
cage
he
said
with
boyish
indignation
and
it
was
for
this
boy
friend
that
raleigh
began
the
book
by
which
we
know
him
best
his
history
of
the
world
never
has
such
a
great
work
been
attempted
by
a
captive
to
write
the
history
of
even
one
country
must
mean
much
labor
much
reading
much
thought
to
write
a
history
of
the
world
still
more
and
i
have
told
you
about
raleigh
because
with
him
begins
an
interest
in
history
beyond
the
bounds
of
our
own
island
before
him
our
historians
had
only
written
of
england
it
gives
us
some
idea
of
the
large
courage
of
raleigh
mind
when
we
remember
that
he
was
over
fifty
when
he
began
this
tremendous
piece
of
work
for
the
sake
of
a
boy
he
loved
raleigh
labored
at
this
book
for
seven
years
or
more
he
was
allowed
to
have
his
own
books
in
prison
sir
robert
cotton
lent
him
others
and
learned
friends
came
to
talk
over
his
book
with
him
and
help
him
and
so
the
pile
of
written
sheets
grew
but
the
book
was
never
finished
for
long
before
the
first
volume
was
ready
the
brave
young
prince
for
whom
it
was
written
died
to
raleigh
this
was
the
cruelest
blow
fate
ever
dealt
him
for
with
the
death
of
prince
henry
died
his
hope
of
freedom
in
spite
of
his
long
imprisonment
raleigh
had
never
lost
hope
of
one
day
regaining
his
freedom
prince
henry
just
before
his
death
had
wrung
an
unwilling
promise
from
the
king
his
father
that
raleigh
should
be
set
free
but
when
the
prince
died
the
king
forgot
his
promise
o
eloquent
just
and
mighty
death
raleigh
says
in
the
last
lines
of
his
book
whom
none
could
advise
thou
hast
persuaded
what
none
hath
dared
thou
hast
done
and
whom
all
the
world
hath
flattered
thou
only
hast
cast
out
of
the
world
and
despised
thou
hast
drawn
together
all
the
far
stretching
greatness
all
the
pride
cruelty
and
ambition
of
man
and
covered
it
all
over
with
these
two
narrow
words
hic
jacet
lastly
whereas
this
book
by
the
title
it
hath
calls
itself
the
first
part
of
the
general
history
of
the
world
implying
a
second
and
third
volume
which
i
also
intended
and
have
hewn
out
besides
many
other
discouragements
persuading
my
silence
it
hath
pleased
god
to
take
that
glorious
prince
out
of
the
world
to
whom
they
were
directed
whose
unspeakable
and
never
enough
lamented
loss
hath
taught
me
to
say
with
job
my
heart
is
turned
to
mourning
and
my
organ
into
the
voice
of
them
that
weep
raleigh
begins
his
great
book
with
the
creation
and
brings
it
down
to
the
third
macedonian
war
which
ended
in
so
you
see
he
did
not
get
far
but
although
when
he
began
he
had
intended
to
write
much
more
he
never
meant
to
bring
his
history
down
to
his
own
time
i
know
that
it
will
be
said
by
many
he
writes
in
his
preface
that
i
might
have
been
more
pleasing
to
the
reader
if
i
had
written
the
story
of
mine
own
times
having
been
permitted
to
draw
water
as
near
the
as
another
to
this
i
answer
that
whosoever
in
writing
a
modern
history
shall
follow
truth
too
near
the
heels
it
may
haply
strike
out
his
teeth
raleigh
feels
it
much
safer
to
write
of
the
elder
times
but
even
so
he
says
there
may
be
people
who
will
think
that
in
speaking
of
the
past
i
point
at
the
present
and
that
under
the
names
of
those
long
dead
he
is
showing
the
vices
of
people
who
are
alive
but
this
i
can
not
help
though
innocent
he
says
raleigh
fears
were
not
without
ground
and
at
one
time
his
history
was
forbidden
by
king
james
for
being
too
saucy
in
censuring
princes
he
took
it
much
to
heart
for
he
thought
he
had
won
his
spurs
and
pleased
the
king
extraordinarily
he
had
hoped
to
please
the
king
and
win
freedom
again
but
his
hopes
were
shattered
at
last
however
the
door
of
his
prison
was
opened
it
was
a
golden
key
that
opened
it
for
raleigh
promised
if
he
were
set
free
to
seek
once
more
the
fabled
golden
city
and
this
time
he
swore
to
find
it
and
bring
home
treasure
untold
to
his
master
the
king
so
once
more
the
imprisoned
was
free
and
gathering
men
and
ships
he
set
forth
on
his
last
voyage
he
set
forth
bearing
with
him
all
his
hopes
all
his
fortune
for
both
raleigh
and
his
wife
almost
beggared
themselves
to
get
money
to
fit
out
the
fleet
and
with
him
as
captain
sailed
his
young
son
walter
a
year
later
raleigh
returned
but
he
returned
without
his
son
with
hopes
broken
fortune
lost
many
fights
and
storms
had
he
endured
many
hardships
suffered
but
he
had
not
found
the
golden
city
his
money
was
spent
his
ships
shattered
his
men
in
mutiny
and
hardest
of
all
to
bear
his
young
son
walter
lay
dead
in
far
guiana
slain
in
a
fight
with
spaniards
how
raleigh
grieved
we
learn
from
his
letter
to
his
wife
i
was
loath
to
write
he
says
because
i
knew
not
how
to
comfort
you
and
god
knows
i
never
knew
what
sorrow
meant
till
now
comfort
your
heart
dearest
bess
i
shall
sorrow
for
us
both
i
shall
sorrow
less
because
i
have
not
long
to
sorrow
because
not
long
to
live
i
have
written
but
that
letter
for
my
brains
are
broken
and
it
is
a
torment
for
me
to
write
and
especially
of
misery
the
lord
bless
and
comfort
you
that
you
may
bear
patiently
the
death
of
your
most
valiant
son
raleigh
came
home
a
sad
and
ruined
man
and
had
the
pity
of
the
king
been
as
easily
aroused
as
his
fear
of
the
spaniards
he
had
surely
been
allowed
to
live
out
the
rest
of
his
life
in
peaceful
quiet
but
james
who
shuddered
at
the
sight
of
a
drawn
sword
feared
the
spaniards
and
had
patched
up
an
imaginary
peace
with
them
and
now
when
the
spanish
ambassador
rushed
into
the
chamber
crying
pirates
pirates
raleigh
fate
was
sealed
raleigh
had
broken
the
peace
in
land
belonging
to
our
dear
brother
the
king
of
spain
said
james
therefore
he
must
die
thus
once
again
raleigh
found
himself
lodged
in
the
tower
but
so
clearly
did
he
show
that
he
had
broken
no
peace
where
no
peace
was
that
it
was
found
impossible
to
put
him
to
death
because
of
what
he
had
done
in
guiana
he
was
condemned
to
death
therefore
on
the
old
charge
of
treason
passed
upon
him
nearly
fifteen
years
before
he
met
death
bravely
and
smiling
clad
in
splendid
clothes
such
as
he
loved
he
mounted
the
scaffold
and
made
his
farewell
speech
to
those
around
is
a
sharp
medicine
but
it
is
a
sound
cure
for
all
diseases
he
said
smiling
to
the
sheriff
as
he
felt
the
edge
of
the
ax
then
he
laid
his
head
upon
the
block
thus
says
the
first
writer
of
raleigh
life
have
we
seen
how
sir
walter
raleigh
who
had
been
one
of
the
greatest
scourges
of
spain
was
made
a
sacrifice
to
it
so
may
we
say
to
the
memory
of
this
worthy
knight

new
ways
of
wisdom
when
we
are
little
there
are
many
things
we
can
not
understand
we
puzzle
about
them
a
good
deal
perhaps
and
then
we
ask
questions
and
sometimes
the
answer
our
question
and
make
the
puzzling
things
clear
to
us
sometimes
they
answer
yet
do
not
make
the
puzzling
things
any
clearer
to
us
and
sometimes
they
tell
us
not
to
trouble
that
we
will
understand
when
we
grow
older
then
we
wish
we
could
grow
older
quick
for
it
seems
such
a
long
time
to
wait
for
an
answer
but
worst
of
all
sometimes
the
tell
us
not
to
talk
so
much
and
not
to
ask
so
many
question
the
fact
is
though
perhaps
i
ought
not
to
tell
you
do
know
everything
that
is
not
any
disgrace
either
for
of
course
no
one
can
know
everything
not
even
father
or
mother
and
just
as
there
are
things
which
puzzle
little
folks
there
are
things
which
puzzle
big
folks
and
just
as
among
little
folks
there
are
some
who
ask
more
questions
and
who
want
to
know
more
than
others
so
among
there
are
some
who
more
than
others
seek
for
the
answer
to
those
puzzling
question
these
people
we
call
philosophers
the
word
comes
from
two
greek
words
philos
loving
sophos
wise
and
means
loving
wisdom
in
this
chapter
i
am
going
to
tell
you
about
francis
bacon
the
great
philosopher
who
lived
in
the
times
of
elizabeth
and
james
i
do
not
think
that
i
can
quite
make
you
understand
what
philosophy
really
means
or
what
his
learned
books
were
about
nor
do
i
think
you
will
care
to
read
them
for
a
long
time
to
come
but
you
will
find
the
life
of
francis
bacon
very
interesting
it
is
well
too
to
know
about
bacon
for
with
him
began
a
new
kind
of
search
for
wisdom
the
old
searchers
after
truth
had
tried
to
settle
the
questions
which
puzzled
them
by
turning
to
imaginary
things
and
by
mere
thinking
bacon
said
that
we
must
answer
these
questions
by
studying
not
what
was
imaginary
but
what
was
real
by
studying
nature
so
bacon
was
not
only
a
lover
of
truth
but
was
also
the
first
of
our
scientists
of
scientist
comes
from
the
latin
word
scio
to
know
and
science
means
that
which
we
know
by
watching
things
and
trying
things
by
making
experiments
and
although
bacon
did
not
himself
find
out
anything
new
and
useful
to
man
he
pointed
out
the
road
upon
which
others
were
to
travel
it
was
upon
a
cold
day
in
january
in
that
francis
bacon
came
crying
into
the
world
he
was
born
in
a
fine
house
and
was
the
child
of
great
people
his
father
being
sir
nicholas
bacon
lord
keeper
of
the
great
seal
but
although
his
father
was
one
of
the
most
important
men
in
the
kingdom
we
know
little
about
francis
as
a
boy
we
know
that
he
met
the
queen
and
that
he
must
have
been
a
clever
little
boy
for
she
would
playfully
call
him
her
young
lord
keeper
once
too
when
she
asked
him
how
old
he
was
he
answered
two
years
younger
than
your
majesty
happy
reign
so
if
you
know
when
elizabeth
began
to
reign
you
will
easily
remember
when
bacon
was
born
spedding
francis
was
the
youngest
of
a
big
family
and
when
he
was
little
more
than
twelve
years
old
he
went
to
trinity
college
cambridge
even
in
those
days
when
people
went
to
college
early
this
was
young
for
three
years
bacon
remained
at
college
and
then
he
went
to
france
with
the
english
ambassador
while
he
was
in
france
his
father
died
and
bacon
returned
home
at
eighteen
he
thus
found
himself
a
poor
lad
with
his
future
to
make
and
only
his
great
name
and
his
own
wits
to
help
him
he
made
up
his
mind
to
take
law
as
his
profession
so
he
set
himself
quietly
to
study
he
worked
hard
for
from
the
very
beginning
he
meant
to
get
on
he
meant
to
be
rich
and
powerful
so
he
bowed
low
before
the
great
he
wrote
letters
to
them
full
of
flattery
he
begged
and
promised
bacon
is
like
a
man
with
two
faces
we
look
at
one
and
we
see
a
kindly
face
full
of
pity
and
sorrow
for
all
wrong
and
pain
that
men
must
suffer
we
see
there
a
longing
to
help
man
to
be
his
friend
we
look
at
the
other
face
and
there
we
see
the
greed
of
gain
the
desire
for
power
and
place
yet
it
may
be
that
bacon
only
strove
to
be
great
so
that
he
might
have
more
power
and
freedom
to
be
pitiful
in
spite
of
bacon
hard
work
in
spite
of
his
flattery
and
begging
he
did
not
rise
fast
after
five
years
we
find
him
indeed
a
barrister
and
a
member
of
parliament
but
among
the
many
great
men
of
his
age
he
was
still
of
little
account
he
had
not
made
his
mark
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
great
lord
burleigh
was
his
uncle
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
elizabeth
had
liked
him
as
a
boy
post
after
post
for
which
he
begged
was
given
to
other
men
he
was
he
said
himself
like
a
child
following
a
bird
which
when
he
is
nearest
flieth
away
and
lighteth
a
little
before
and
then
the
child
after
it
again
and
so
in
infinitum
i
am
weary
of
it
but
one
friend
at
court
he
found
in
the
earl
of
essex
the
favorite
of
elizabeth
the
rival
of
raleigh
essex
however
who
could
win
so
much
favor
for
himself
could
win
none
for
francis
bacon
being
able
to
win
nothing
from
the
queen
on
his
own
account
essex
gave
his
friend
an
estate
worth
about
pounds
but
although
that
may
have
been
some
comfort
to
bacon
it
did
not
win
for
him
greatness
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
the
only
greatness
for
which
he
longed
as
to
the
queen
she
made
use
of
him
when
it
pleased
her
but
she
had
no
love
for
him
though
she
cheered
him
much
with
the
bounty
of
her
countenance
says
an
early
writer
of
bacon
life
his
friend
and
chaplain
yet
she
never
cheered
him
with
the
bounty
of
her
hand
it
was
alas
that
bounty
of
the
hand
that
bacon
begged
for
and
stooped
for
all
through
his
life
yet
he
cared
nothing
for
money
for
its
own
sake
for
what
he
had
he
spent
carelessly
he
loved
to
keep
high
state
he
loved
grandeur
and
was
always
in
debt
william
rawley
essex
through
all
his
brilliant
years
when
the
queen
smiled
upon
him
stuck
by
his
friend
for
him
he
spent
his
power
might
authority
and
amity
in
vain
when
the
dark
hours
came
and
essex
fell
into
disgrace
it
was
bacon
who
forgot
his
friendship
you
will
read
in
of
how
essex
against
the
orders
left
ireland
and
coming
to
london
burst
into
her
presence
one
morning
before
she
was
dressed
you
will
read
of
how
he
was
disgraced
and
imprisoned
at
first
bacon
did
what
he
could
for
his
friend
and
it
was
through
his
help
that
essex
was
set
free
but
even
then
bacon
wrote
to
the
earl
i
confess
i
love
some
things
much
better
than
i
love
your
lordship
as
the
queen
service
her
quiet
and
contentment
her
honour
her
favour
the
good
of
my
country
and
the
like
yet
i
love
few
persons
better
than
yourself
both
for
gratitude
sake
and
for
your
own
virtues
set
free
essex
rushed
into
passionate
futile
rebellion
again
he
was
made
prisoner
and
tried
for
high
treason
it
was
then
that
bacon
had
to
choose
between
friend
and
queen
he
chose
his
queen
and
appeared
in
court
against
his
friend
to
do
anything
else
bacon
told
himself
had
been
utterly
useless
essex
was
now
of
no
more
use
to
him
he
was
too
surely
fallen
to
cling
to
him
could
do
not
good
but
would
only
bring
the
queen
anger
upon
himself
also
and
yet
he
had
written
it
is
friendship
when
a
man
can
say
to
himself
i
love
this
man
without
respect
of
utility
i
make
him
a
portion
of
my
own
wishes
he
wrote
that
as
a
young
man
later
he
saw
nothing
in
friendship
beyond
use
the
trial
of
essex
must
have
been
a
brilliant
scene
the
earl
himself
young
fair
of
face
splendidly
clad
stood
at
the
bar
he
showed
no
fear
his
bearing
was
as
proud
and
bold
as
ever
but
whether
his
courage
were
borrowed
and
put
on
for
the
time
or
natural
it
were
hard
to
judge
the
lord
treasurer
the
lord
high
steward
too
were
there
and
peers
nine
earls
and
sixteen
barons
to
try
the
case
among
the
learned
counsel
sat
bacon
a
disappointed
man
of
forty
there
was
nothing
to
single
him
out
from
his
fellows
save
that
he
was
the
friend
and
as
such
might
be
looked
upon
to
do
his
best
to
save
him
chamberlain
as
the
trial
went
on
however
bacon
spoke
not
to
save
but
to
condemn
did
no
memory
of
past
kindliness
cross
his
mind
as
he
likened
his
friend
to
cain
that
first
murderer
as
he
complained
to
the
court
that
too
much
favor
was
shown
to
the
prisoner
that
he
had
never
before
heard
so
ill
a
defense
of
such
great
and
notorious
treasons
the
earl
answered
in
his
own
defense
again
and
yet
again
but
at
length
he
was
silent
his
case
was
hopeless
and
he
was
condemned
to
death
he
was
executed
on
february
perhaps
bacon
could
not
have
saved
his
friend
from
death
but
had
he
used
his
wit
to
try
at
least
to
save
instead
of
helping
to
condemn
he
would
have
kept
his
own
name
from
a
dark
blot
but
a
greater
betrayal
of
friendship
was
yet
to
follow
though
essex
had
been
wild
and
foolish
the
people
loved
him
and
now
they
murmured
against
the
queen
for
causing
his
death
then
it
was
thought
well
that
they
should
know
all
the
blackness
of
his
misdeeds
and
it
was
bacon
who
was
called
upon
to
write
the
story
of
them
even
from
this
he
did
not
shrink
for
he
hoped
for
great
rewards
but
as
before
the
queen
used
him
and
withheld
the
bounty
of
her
hand
from
her
he
received
no
state
appointment
he
did
indeed
receive
pounds
in
money
it
was
scarcely
as
much
as
essex
had
once
given
him
out
of
friendship
to
bacon
it
seemed
too
small
a
reward
for
his
betrayal
of
his
friend
even
although
it
had
seemed
to
mean
loyalty
to
his
queen
the
queen
hath
done
somewhat
for
me
he
wrote
though
not
in
the
proportion
i
hoped
and
so
in
debt
and
with
a
blotted
name
bacon
lived
on
until
queen
elizabeth
died
but
with
the
new
king
his
fortunes
began
to
rise
first
he
was
made
sir
francis
bacon
then
from
one
honor
to
another
he
rose
until
he
became
at
last
lord
high
chancellor
of
england
the
highest
judge
in
the
land
a
few
months
later
he
was
made
a
peer
with
the
title
of
baron
verulam
a
few
years
later
at
the
age
of
sixty
he
went
still
one
step
higher
and
became
viscount
albans
bacon
chose
the
name
of
baron
verulam
from
the
name
of
the
old
roman
city
verulamium
which
was
afterwards
called
albans
it
was
near
albans
that
bacon
had
built
himself
a
splendid
house
laid
out
a
beautiful
garden
and
planted
fine
trees
and
there
he
kept
as
great
state
as
the
king
himself
he
had
now
reached
his
highest
power
he
had
published
his
great
work
called
the
novum
organum
or
new
instrument
in
which
he
taught
men
a
new
way
of
wisdom
he
was
the
greatest
judge
in
the
land
and
a
peer
of
the
realm
he
had
married
too
but
he
never
had
any
children
and
we
know
little
of
his
home
life
it
seemed
as
if
at
last
he
had
all
he
could
wish
for
as
if
his
life
would
end
in
a
blaze
of
glory
but
instead
of
that
in
a
few
short
weeks
after
he
became
viscount
albans
he
was
a
disgraced
and
fallen
man
he
had
always
loved
splendor
and
pomp
he
had
always
spent
more
than
he
could
afford
now
he
was
accused
of
taking
bribes
that
is
he
was
accused
of
taking
money
from
people
and
instead
of
judging
fairly
of
judging
in
favor
of
those
who
had
given
him
most
money
he
was
accused
in
fact
of
selling
justice
that
he
should
sell
justice
is
the
blackest
charge
that
can
be
brought
against
a
judge
at
first
bacon
could
not
believe
that
any
one
would
dare
to
attack
him
but
when
he
heard
that
it
was
true
he
sank
beneath
the
disgrace
he
made
no
resistance
his
health
gave
way
on
his
he
owned
that
he
had
taken
presents
yet
to
the
end
he
protested
that
he
had
judged
justly
he
had
taken
the
bribes
indeed
but
they
had
made
no
difference
to
his
judgments
he
had
not
sold
justice
he
made
his
confession
and
stood
to
it
my
lords
he
said
it
is
my
act
my
hand
my
heart
i
beseech
your
lordships
be
merciful
to
a
broken
reed
bacon
was
condemned
to
pay
a
fine
of
pounds
to
be
imprisoned
during
the
king
pleasure
never
more
to
have
office
of
any
kind
never
to
sit
in
parliament
nor
come
within
the
verge
of
the
court
i
was
the
justest
judge
that
was
in
england
these
fifty
years
said
bacon
afterwards
but
it
was
the
justest
censure
in
parliament
that
was
these
two
hundred
years
bacon
punishment
was
not
as
heavy
as
at
first
sight
it
seems
for
the
fine
was
forgiven
him
and
the
king
pleasure
made
his
imprisonment
in
the
tower
only
a
matter
of
a
few
days
and
now
that
his
life
was
shipwrecked
though
he
never
ceased
to
long
to
return
to
his
old
greatness
he
gave
all
his
time
to
writing
and
to
science
he
spent
many
peaceful
hours
in
the
garden
that
he
loved
his
lordship
we
are
told
was
a
very
contemplative
person
and
was
wont
to
contemplate
in
his
delicious
walks
he
was
generally
accompanied
by
one
of
the
gentlemen
of
his
household
that
attended
him
with
ink
and
paper
ready
to
set
down
presently
his
thoughts
aubrey
he
was
not
soured
or
bitter
though
his
fortunes
may
have
changed
says
one
of
his
household
yet
i
never
saw
any
change
in
his
mien
his
words
or
his
deeds
towards
any
man
but
he
was
always
the
same
both
in
sorrow
and
joy
as
a
philosopher
ought
to
be
boerner
his
apothecary
and
secretary
bacon
was
now
shut
out
from
honorable
work
in
the
world
but
he
had
no
desire
to
be
idle
i
have
read
in
books
he
wrote
that
it
is
accounted
a
great
bliss
to
have
leisure
with
honour
that
was
never
my
fortune
for
time
was
i
had
honour
without
leisure
and
now
i
have
leisure
without
honour
but
my
desire
is
now
to
have
leisure
without
loitering
so
now
he
lived
as
he
himself
said
a
long
cleansing
week
of
five
years
then
the
end
came
it
was
bacon
thirst
for
knowledge
that
caused
his
death
one
winter
day
when
the
snow
lay
on
the
ground
he
drove
out
in
his
coach
suddenly
as
he
drove
along
looking
at
the
fields
and
roads
around
the
thought
came
to
him
that
food
might
be
kept
good
by
means
of
snow
as
easily
as
by
salt
he
resolved
to
try
so
stopping
his
coach
he
went
into
a
poor
cottage
and
bought
a
hen
the
woman
killed
and
made
ready
the
hen
but
bacon
was
so
eager
about
his
experiment
that
he
stuffed
it
himself
with
snow
in
doing
this
he
was
so
chilled
by
the
cold
that
he
became
suddenly
ill
too
ill
to
return
home
he
was
taken
to
a
house
near
where
they
put
him
into
a
good
bed
warmed
with
a
pan
and
there
after
a
few
days
he
died
aubrey
this
little
story
of
how
bacon
came
by
his
death
gives
a
good
idea
of
how
he
tried
to
make
use
of
his
philosophy
he
was
not
content
with
thinking
and
speculating
that
is
looking
at
ideas
speculate
comes
from
the
latin
speculari
to
spy
out
he
wanted
to
experiment
too
and
although
in
those
days
no
one
had
thought
about
it
we
now
know
that
bacon
was
quite
right
and
that
meat
can
be
kept
by
freezing
it
and
it
is
pleasant
to
know
that
before
bacon
died
he
was
able
to
write
that
the
experiment
had
succeeded
excellently
well
in
his
will
bacon
left
his
name
and
memory
to
men
charitable
speeches
to
foreign
nations
and
to
the
next
ages
and
he
was
right
to
do
so
for
in
spite
of
all
the
dark
shadows
that
hang
about
his
name
men
still
call
him
great
we
remember
him
as
a
great
man
among
great
men
we
remember
him
as
the
of
modern
science
we
remember
him
for
the
splendid
english
in
which
he
wrote
and
yet
although
bacon
english
is
clear
strong
and
fine
although
elizabethan
english
perhaps
reached
in
him
its
highest
point
he
himself
despised
english
he
did
not
believe
that
it
was
a
language
that
would
live
and
as
he
wanted
his
books
to
be
read
by
people
all
over
the
world
and
in
all
time
to
come
he
wrote
his
greatest
books
in
latin
he
grieved
that
he
had
wasted
time
in
writing
english
and
he
had
much
that
he
wrote
in
english
translated
into
latin
during
his
lifetime
it
seems
strange
to
us
now
that
in
an
age
when
spenser
and
shakespeare
had
show
the
world
what
the
english
tongue
had
power
to
do
that
any
man
should
have
been
able
to
disbelieve
in
its
greatness
but
so
it
was
and
bacon
translated
his
books
into
latin
so
that
they
might
live
when
english
books
were
not
i
will
not
weary
you
with
a
list
of
all
the
books
bacon
wrote
although
it
is
not
considered
his
greatest
work
that
by
which
most
people
know
him
is
his
book
of
essays
by
an
essay
bacon
meant
a
testing
or
proving
in
the
short
chapters
of
his
essays
he
tries
and
proves
many
things
such
as
friendship
study
honor
and
when
you
come
to
read
these
essays
you
will
be
surprised
to
find
how
many
of
the
sentences
are
known
to
you
already
they
have
become
household
words
and
without
knowing
it
we
repeat
bacon
wisdom
but
we
miss
in
them
something
of
human
kindliness
bacon
wisdom
is
cool
calm
and
calculating
and
we
long
sometimes
for
a
little
warmth
a
little
passion
and
not
so
much
use
the
essays
are
best
known
but
the
new
atlantis
is
the
book
that
you
will
best
like
to
read
for
it
is
something
of
a
story
and
of
it
i
will
tell
you
a
little
in
the
next
chapter
chapter
liii
bacon
the
happy
island
atlantis
was
a
fabled
island
of
the
greeks
which
lay
somewhere
in
the
western
sea
that
island
it
was
pretended
sank
beneath
the
waves
and
was
lost
and
bacon
makes
believe
that
he
finds
another
island
something
like
it
in
the
pacific
ocean
and
calls
it
the
new
atlantis
here
as
in
more
utopia
the
people
living
under
just
and
wise
laws
are
happy
and
good
perhaps
some
day
you
will
be
interested
enough
to
read
these
two
books
together
and
compare
them
then
one
great
difference
will
strike
you
at
once
in
the
utopia
all
is
dull
and
gray
only
children
are
pleased
with
jewels
only
prisoners
are
loaded
with
golden
chains
in
the
new
atlantis
jewels
and
gold
gleam
and
flash
the
love
of
splendor
and
color
shows
itself
almost
in
every
page
bacon
wastes
no
time
in
explanation
but
launches
right
into
the
middle
of
his
story
we
sailed
from
peru
he
says
where
we
had
continued
by
the
space
of
one
whole
year
for
china
and
japan
by
the
south
sea
taking
with
us
victuals
for
twelve
months
and
through
all
the
story
we
are
not
told
who
the
we
were
or
what
their
names
or
business
there
were
we
learn
persons
in
all
on
board
the
ship
after
some
good
sailing
they
met
with
storms
of
wind
they
were
driven
about
now
here
now
there
their
food
began
to
fail
and
finding
themselves
in
the
midst
of
the
greatest
wilderness
of
waters
in
the
world
they
gave
themselves
us
as
lost
but
presently
one
evening
they
saw
upon
one
hand
what
seemed
like
darker
clouds
but
which
in
the
end
proved
to
be
land
and
after
an
hour
and
a
half
sailing
we
entered
into
a
good
haven
being
the
port
of
a
fair
city
not
great
indeed
but
well
built
and
that
gave
a
pleasant
view
from
the
sea
and
we
thinking
every
minute
long
till
we
were
on
land
came
close
to
the
shore
and
offered
to
land
but
straightways
we
saw
divers
of
the
people
with
bastons
in
their
hands
as
it
were
forbidding
us
to
land
yet
without
any
cries
or
fierceness
but
only
as
warning
us
off
by
signs
that
they
made
whereupon
being
not
a
little
discomforted
we
were
advising
with
ourselves
what
we
should
do
during
which
time
there
made
forth
to
us
a
small
boat
with
about
eight
persons
in
it
whereof
one
of
them
had
in
his
hand
a
of
a
yellow
cane
tipped
at
both
ends
with
blue
who
came
aboard
our
ship
without
any
show
of
distrust
at
all
and
when
he
saw
one
of
our
number
present
himself
somewhat
before
the
rest
he
drew
forth
a
little
scroll
of
parchment
somewhat
yellower
than
our
parchment
and
shining
like
the
leaves
of
but
otherwise
soft
and
flexible
and
delivered
it
to
our
foremost
man
in
which
scroll
were
written
in
ancient
hebrew
and
in
ancient
greek
and
in
good
latin
of
the
school
and
in
spanish
these
words
ye
not
none
of
you
and
provide
to
be
gone
from
this
coast
within
sixteen
days
except
ye
have
further
time
given
you
meanwhile
if
ye
want
fresh
water
or
victual
or
help
for
your
sick
or
that
your
ship
needeth
repair
write
down
your
wants
and
ye
shall
have
that
which
belongeth
to
mercy
of
office
this
scroll
was
signed
with
a
stamp
of
cherubim
wings
not
spread
but
hanging
downwards
and
by
them
a
cross
this
being
delivered
the
officer
returned
and
left
only
a
servant
with
us
to
receive
our
answer
consulting
thereupon
among
ourselves
we
were
much
perplexed
the
denial
of
landing
and
hasty
warning
us
away
troubled
us
much
on
the
other
side
to
find
that
the
people
had
languages
and
were
so
full
of
humanity
did
comfort
us
not
a
little
and
above
all
the
sign
of
the
cross
to
that
instrument
was
to
us
a
great
rejoicing
and
as
it
were
a
certain
presage
of
good
our
answer
was
in
the
spanish
tongue
for
our
ship
it
was
well
for
we
had
rather
met
with
calms
and
contrary
winds
than
any
tempests
for
our
sick
they
were
many
and
in
very
ill
case
so
that
if
they
were
not
permitted
to
land
they
ran
danger
of
their
lives
our
other
wants
we
set
down
in
particular
adding
we
had
some
little
store
of
merchandise
which
if
it
pleased
them
to
deal
for
it
might
supply
our
wants
without
being
chargeable
unto
them
we
offered
some
reward
in
pistolets
unto
the
servant
and
a
piece
of
crimson
velvet
to
be
presented
to
the
officer
but
the
servant
took
them
not
nor
would
scarce
look
upon
them
and
so
left
us
and
went
back
in
another
little
boat
which
was
sent
for
him
about
three
hours
after
the
answer
had
been
sent
the
ship
was
visited
by
another
great
man
from
the
island
he
had
on
him
a
gown
with
wide
sleeves
of
a
kind
of
water
chamelot
of
an
excellent
azure
colour
far
more
glossy
than
ours
his
under
apparel
was
green
and
so
was
his
hat
being
in
the
form
of
a
turban
daintily
made
and
not
so
huge
as
the
turkish
turbans
and
the
locks
of
his
hair
came
down
below
the
brims
of
it
a
reverend
man
was
he
to
behold
he
came
in
a
boat
gilt
in
some
part
of
it
with
four
persons
more
only
in
that
boat
and
was
followed
by
another
boat
wherein
were
some
twenty
when
he
was
come
within
a
flight
shot
of
our
ship
signs
were
made
to
us
that
we
should
send
forth
some
to
meet
him
upon
the
water
which
we
presently
did
in
our
shipboat
sending
the
principal
man
amongst
us
save
one
and
four
of
our
number
with
him
when
we
were
come
within
six
yards
of
their
boat
they
called
to
us
to
stay
and
not
to
approach
further
which
we
did
and
thereupon
the
man
whom
i
before
described
stood
up
and
with
a
loud
voice
in
spanish
asked
ye
christians
we
answered
were
fearing
the
less
because
of
the
cross
we
had
seen
in
the
subscription
at
which
answer
the
said
person
lifted
up
his
right
hand
towards
heaven
and
drew
it
softly
to
his
mouth
which
is
the
gesture
they
use
when
they
thank
god
and
then
said
ye
will
swear
all
of
you
by
the
merits
of
the
saviour
that
ye
are
not
pirates
nor
have
shed
blood
lawfully
or
unlawfully
within
forty
days
past
you
may
have
licence
to
come
on
land
we
said
were
all
ready
to
take
that
oath
whereupon
one
of
those
that
were
with
him
being
as
it
seemed
a
notary
made
an
entry
of
this
act
which
done
another
of
the
attendants
of
the
great
person
which
was
with
him
in
the
same
boat
after
his
lord
had
spoken
a
little
to
him
said
aloud
lord
would
have
you
know
that
it
is
not
of
pride
or
greatness
that
he
cometh
out
aboard
your
ship
but
for
that
in
your
answer
you
declare
that
you
have
many
sick
amongst
you
he
was
warned
by
the
conservator
of
health
of
the
city
that
he
should
keep
a
distance
we
bowed
ourselves
towards
him
and
answered
were
his
humble
servants
and
accounted
for
great
honour
and
singular
humanity
towards
us
that
which
was
already
done
but
hoped
well
that
the
nature
of
the
sickness
of
our
men
was
not
infectious
so
he
returned
and
a
while
after
came
the
notary
to
us
aboard
our
ship
holding
in
his
hand
a
fruit
of
that
country
like
an
orange
but
of
colour
between
and
scarlet
which
cast
a
most
excellent
odour
he
used
it
as
it
seemeth
for
a
preservative
against
infection
he
gave
us
our
oath
the
name
of
jesus
and
of
his
merits
and
after
told
us
that
the
next
day
by
six
of
the
clock
in
the
morning
we
should
be
sent
to
and
brought
to
the
strangers
house
so
he
called
it
where
we
should
be
accommodated
of
things
both
for
our
whole
and
for
our
sick
so
he
left
us
and
when
we
offered
him
some
pistolets
he
smiling
said
must
not
be
twice
paid
for
one
labour
meaning
as
i
take
it
that
he
had
salary
sufficient
of
the
state
for
his
service
for
as
i
after
leaned
they
call
an
officer
that
taketh
rewards
twice
paid
so
next
morning
the
people
landed
from
the
ship
and
bacon
goes
on
to
tell
us
of
the
wonderful
things
they
saw
and
learned
in
the
island
the
most
wonderful
thing
was
a
place
called
house
in
describing
it
bacon
was
describing
such
a
house
as
he
hoped
one
day
to
see
in
england
it
was
a
great
establishment
in
which
everything
that
might
be
of
use
to
mankind
was
studied
and
taught
and
bacon
speaks
of
many
things
which
were
only
guessed
at
in
his
time
he
speaks
of
high
towers
wherein
people
watched
winds
rain
snow
hail
and
some
of
the
fiery
meteors
also
we
have
observatories
he
speaks
of
help
for
the
sight
far
above
spectacles
and
glasses
also
glasses
and
means
to
see
small
and
minute
bodies
perfectly
and
distinctly
as
the
shapes
and
colours
of
small
flies
and
worms
grains
and
flaws
in
gems
which
can
not
otherwise
be
seen
we
have
the
microscope
he
says
we
have
also
means
to
convey
sounds
in
trunks
and
pipes
in
strange
lines
and
distances
yet
in
those
days
no
one
had
dreamed
of
a
telephone
we
imitate
also
flights
of
birds
we
have
some
degrees
of
flying
in
the
air
we
have
ships
and
boats
for
going
under
water
yet
in
those
days
stories
of
or
torpedoes
would
have
been
treated
as
fairy
tales
bacon
did
not
finish
the
new
atlantis
the
rest
was
not
perfected
are
the
last
words
in
the
book
and
it
was
not
published
until
after
his
death
these
words
might
almost
have
been
written
of
bacon
himself
a
great
writer
a
great
man
but
the
rest
was
not
perfected
he
put
his
trust
in
princes
and
he
fell
yet
into
the
land
of
knowledge
bacon
like
moses
led
us
forth
at
last
the
barren
wilderness
he
passed
did
on
the
very
border
stand
of
the
blest
promised
land
and
from
the
mountain
top
of
his
exalted
wit
saw
it
himself
and
shew
us
it
but
life
did
never
to
one
man
allow
time
to
discover
worlds
and
conquer
too
nor
can
so
short
a
line
sufficient
be
to
fathom
the
vast
depths
of
nature
sea
the
work
he
did
we
ought
and
were
unjust
if
we
should
more
require
from
his
few
years
divided
twixt
th
excess
of
low
affliction
and
high
happiness
for
who
on
things
remote
can
fix
his
sight
that
always
in
a
triumph
or
a
fight
cowley
to
the
royal
society
you
will
like
to
know
that
less
than
forty
years
after
death
a
society
called
the
royal
society
was
founded
this
is
a
society
which
interests
itself
in
scientific
study
and
research
and
is
the
oldest
of
its
kind
in
great
britain
it
was
fancy
of
solomon
house
which
led
men

liv
about
some
lyric
poets
before
either
ben
jonson
or
bacon
died
a
second
stuart
king
sat
on
the
throne
of
england
this
was
charles
i
the
son
of
james
vi
and
i
the
spacious
days
of
queen
elizabeth
were
over
and
gone
and
the
temper
of
the
people
was
changing
elizabeth
had
been
a
tyrant
but
the
people
of
england
had
yielded
to
her
tyranny
james
too
was
a
tyrant
but
the
people
struggled
with
him
and
in
the
struggle
they
grew
stronger
in
the
days
of
elizabeth
the
religion
of
england
was
still
unsettled
james
decided
that
the
religion
of
england
must
be
episcopal
but
as
the
reign
of
james
went
on
england
became
more
and
more
puritan
and
the
breach
between
king
and
people
grew
wide
for
james
was
no
puritan
nor
was
charles
after
him
as
the
temper
of
the
people
changed
the
literature
changed
too
as
england
grew
puritan
the
people
began
to
look
askance
at
the
theater
for
the
puritans
had
always
been
its
enemies
puritan
ideas
drew
the
great
mass
of
thinking
people
for
one
reason
or
another
the
plays
that
were
written
became
by
degrees
poorer
and
poorer
they
were
coarse
too
many
of
them
so
much
so
that
we
do
not
care
to
read
them
now
but
people
wrote
such
stories
as
the
of
those
days
liked
and
from
them
we
can
judge
how
low
the
taste
of
england
had
fallen
however
there
were
people
in
england
in
those
days
who
revolted
against
this
taste
and
in
when
the
great
struggle
between
king
parliament
had
begun
all
theaters
were
closed
by
order
of
parliament
so
for
a
time
the
life
of
english
drama
paused
but
while
dramatic
poetry
declined
lyric
poetry
flourished
lyric
comes
from
the
greek
word
lura
a
lyre
and
all
lyric
poetry
was
at
one
time
meant
to
be
sung
now
we
use
the
word
for
any
short
poem
whether
meant
to
be
sung
or
not
in
the
times
of
james
and
charles
there
were
many
lyric
poets
especially
in
the
time
of
charles
it
was
natural
that
poets
should
write
lyrics
rather
than
longer
poems
for
a
time
of
strong
action
of
fierce
struggle
was
beginning
and
amid
the
clash
of
arms
men
had
no
leisure
to
sit
in
the
study
and
ponder
long
and
quietly
but
life
brought
with
it
many
sharp
and
quick
moments
and
these
could
be
best
expressed
in
lyric
poetry
and
as
was
natural
when
religion
was
more
and
more
being
mixed
with
politics
when
life
was
forcing
people
to
think
about
religion
whether
they
would
or
not
many
of
these
lyric
poets
were
religious
poets
indeed
this
is
the
great
time
of
english
religious
poetry
so
these
lyric
poets
were
divided
into
two
classes
the
religious
poets
and
the
court
poets
gay
cavaliers
these
last
who
sang
songs
too
in
which
we
often
seem
to
hear
the
clash
of
swords
for
if
these
brave
and
careless
cavaliers
loved
gayly
they
fought
and
died
as
gayly
as
they
loved
later
on
when
you
come
to
read
more
in
english
literature
you
will
learn
to
know
many
of
these
poets
in
this
book
we
have
not
room
to
tell
about
them
or
even
to
mention
their
names
their
stories
are
bound
up
with
the
stories
of
the
times
and
many
of
them
fought
and
suffered
for
their
king
but
i
will
give
you
one
or
two
poems
which
may
make
you
want
to
know
more
about
the
writers
of
them
here
are
two
written
by
richard
lovelace
the
very
model
of
a
gay
cavalier
while
he
was
at
oxford
king
charles
saw
him
and
made
him
or
master
of
arts
not
for
his
learning
but
because
of
his
beautiful
face
he
went
to
court
and
made
love
and
sang
songs
gayly
he
went
to
battle
and
fought
and
sang
as
gayly
he
went
to
prison
and
still
sang
to
the
cause
of
his
king
he
clung
through
all
and
when
charles
was
dead
and
cromwell
ruled
with
his
stern
hand
and
song
was
hushed
in
england
he
died
miserably
in
a
poor
london
alley
the
first
of
these
songs
was
written
by
lovelace
while
he
was
in
prison
for
having
presented
a
petition
to
the
house
of
commons
asking
that
king
charles
might
be
restored
to
the
throne
to
althea
from
prison
when
love
with
unconfinéd
wings
hovers
within
my
gates
and
my
divine
althea
brings
to
whisper
at
the
grates
when
i
lye
tangled
in
her
haire
and
fettered
to
her
eye
the
gods
that
wanton
in
the
aire
know
no
such
liberty
when
like
committed
linnets
i
with
shriller
throat
shall
sing
the
sweetness
mercy
majesty
and
glories
of
my
king
when
i
shall
voyce
aloud
how
good
he
is
how
great
should
be
enlargéd
winds
that
curle
the
flood
know
no
such
liberty
stone
walls
do
not
a
prison
make
nor
iron
bars
a
cage
mindes
innocent
and
quiet
take
that
for
an
hermitage
if
i
have
freedome
in
my
love
and
in
my
soule
am
free
angels
alone
that
soar
above
enjoy
such
liberty
to
lucasta
going
to
the
warres
tell
me
not
sweet
i
am
unkinde
that
from
the
nunnerie
of
thy
chaste
heart
and
quiet
minde
to
warre
and
armes
i
flie
true
a
new
mistresse
now
i
chase
the
first
foe
in
the
field
and
with
a
stronger
faith
embrace
a
sword
a
horse
a
shield
yet
this
inconstancy
is
such
as
you
too
shall
adore
i
could
not
love
thee
dear
so
much
lov
i
not
honour
more
james
graham
marquis
of
montrose
was
another
cavalier
poet
whose
fine
sad
story
you
will
read
in
history
he
loved
his
king
and
fought
and
suffered
for
him
and
when
he
heard
that
he
was
dead
he
drew
his
sword
and
wrote
a
poem
with
its
point
great
good
and
just
could
i
but
rate
my
grief
and
thy
too
rigid
fate
i
weep
the
world
in
such
a
strain
as
it
should
deluge
once
again
but
since
thy
blood
demands
supplies
more
from
briareus
hands
than
argus
eyes
i
sing
thy
obsequies
with
trumpet
sounds
and
write
thine
epitaph
in
blood
and
wounds
he
wrote
too
a
famous
song
known
as
montrose
here
it
is
my
dear
and
only
love
i
pray
this
noble
world
of
thee
be
governed
by
no
other
sway
but
purest
monarchie
for
if
confusion
have
a
part
which
vertuous
souls
abhore
and
hold
a
synod
in
thy
heart
i
never
love
thee
more
like
alexander
i
will
reign
and
i
will
reign
alone
my
thoughts
shall
evermore
disdain
a
rival
on
my
throne
he
either
fears
his
fate
too
much
or
his
deserts
are
small
that
puts
it
not
unto
the
touch
to
win
or
lose
it
all
but
i
must
rule
and
govern
still
and
always
give
the
law
and
have
each
subject
at
my
will
and
all
to
stand
in
awe
but
my
battery
if
i
find
thou
the
prize
so
sore
as
that
thou
me
up
a
blind
i
never
love
thee
more
if
in
the
empire
of
thy
heart
where
i
should
solely
be
another
do
pretend
a
part
and
dares
to
vie
with
me
or
if
committees
thou
erect
and
goes
on
such
a
score
i
sing
and
laugh
at
thy
neglect
and
never
love
thee
more
but
if
thou
wilt
be
constant
then
and
faithful
to
thy
word
i
make
thee
glorious
with
my
pen
and
famous
by
my
sword
i
serve
thee
in
such
noble
ways
was
never
heard
before
i
crown
and
deck
thee
all
with
bays
and
love
thee
more
and
more
in
these
few
cavalier
songs
we
can
see
the
spirit
of
the
times
there
is
gay
carelessness
of
death
strong
courage
in
misfortune
passionate
loyalty
there
is
too
the
proud
spirit
of
the
tyrant
which
is
gentle
and
loving
when
obeyed
harsh
and
cruel
if
disobeyed
there
is
another
song
by
a
cavalier
poet
which
i
should
like
to
give
you
it
is
a
too
but
it
does
not
tell
of
these
stormy
times
or
ring
with
the
noise
of
battle
rather
it
takes
us
away
to
a
peaceful
summer
morning
before
the
sun
is
up
when
everything
is
still
when
the
dew
trembles
on
every
blade
of
grass
and
the
air
is
fresh
and
cool
and
sweet
with
summer
scents
and
in
this
cool
freshness
we
hear
the
song
of
the
lark
the
lark
now
leaves
his
nest
and
climbing
shakes
his
dewy
wings
he
takes
this
window
for
the
east
and
to
implore
your
light
he
sings
awake
the
morn
will
never
rise
till
she
can
dress
her
beauty
at
your
eyes
the
merchant
bow
unto
the
seaman
star
the
ploughman
from
the
sun
his
season
takes
but
still
the
lover
wonders
what
they
are
who
look
for
day
before
his
mistress
wakes
awake
break
thro
your
veils
of
lawn
then
draw
your
curtains
and
begin
the
dawn
that
was
written
by
william
davenant
it
is
one
our
most
beautiful
songs
and
he
is
remembered
by
it
far
more
than
by
his
long
epic
poem
called
gondibert
which
few
people
now
read
but
i
think
you
will
agree
with
me
that
his
name
is
worthy
of
being
remembered
for
that
one
song
alone
chapter
lv
herbert
the
parson
poet
having
told
you
a
little
about
the
songs
of
the
cavaliers
i
must
now
tell
you
something
about
the
religious
poets
who
were
a
feature
of
the
age
of
all
our
religious
poets
of
this
time
at
least
george
herbert
is
the
greatest
he
was
born
in
near
the
town
of
montgomery
and
was
the
son
of
a
noble
family
but
his
father
died
when
he
was
little
more
than
three
leaving
his
mother
to
bring
up
george
with
his
nine
brothers
and
sisters
george
herbert
mother
was
a
good
and
beautiful
woman
and
she
loved
her
children
so
well
that
the
poet
said
afterwards
she
had
been
twice
a
mother
to
him
at
twelve
he
was
sent
to
westminster
school
where
we
are
told
the
beauties
of
his
pretty
behaviour
shined
so
that
he
seemed
to
become
the
care
of
heaven
and
of
a
particular
good
angel
to
guard
and
guide
him
walton
at
fifteen
he
went
to
trinity
college
cambridge
and
now
although
separated
from
his
dear
and
careful
mother
he
did
not
forget
her
or
all
that
she
had
taught
him
already
he
was
a
poet
we
find
him
sending
verses
as
a
new
year
gift
to
his
mother
and
writing
to
her
that
my
poor
abilities
in
poetry
shall
be
all
and
ever
consecrated
to
god
glory
same
as
the
years
went
on
herbert
worked
hard
and
became
a
gently
good
as
well
as
a
learned
man
and
in
time
he
was
given
the
post
of
public
orator
at
the
university
this
post
brought
him
into
touch
with
the
court
and
with
the
king
of
this
george
herbert
was
glad
for
although
he
was
a
good
and
saintly
man
he
longed
to
be
a
courtier
often
now
he
went
to
court
hoping
for
some
great
post
but
james
i
died
in
and
with
him
died
george
herbert
hope
of
rising
to
be
great
in
the
world
for
a
time
then
he
left
court
and
went
into
the
country
and
there
he
passed
through
a
great
struggle
with
himself
the
question
he
had
to
settle
was
whether
he
should
return
to
the
painted
pleasure
of
a
court
life
or
become
a
priest
in
the
end
he
decided
to
become
a
priest
and
when
a
friend
tried
to
dissuade
him
from
the
calling
as
one
too
much
below
his
birth
he
answered
it
hath
been
judged
formerly
that
the
domestic
servants
of
the
king
of
heaven
should
be
one
of
the
noblest
families
on
earth
and
though
the
iniquity
of
late
times
have
made
clergymen
meanly
valued
and
the
sacred
name
of
priest
contemptible
yet
i
will
labor
to
make
it
honorable
and
i
will
labor
to
be
like
my
saviour
by
making
humility
lovely
in
the
eyes
of
all
men
and
by
following
the
merciful
and
meek
example
of
my
dear
jesus
but
before
herbert
was
fully
ordained
a
great
change
came
into
his
life
the
church
of
england
was
now
protestant
and
priests
were
allowed
to
marry
and
george
herbert
married
the
story
of
how
he
met
his
wife
is
pretty
herbert
was
such
a
cheerful
and
good
man
that
he
had
many
friends
it
was
said
indeed
that
he
had
no
enemy
among
his
many
friends
was
one
named
danvers
who
loved
him
so
much
that
he
said
nothing
would
make
him
so
happy
as
that
george
should
marry
one
of
his
nine
daughters
but
specially
he
wished
him
to
marry
his
daughter
jane
for
he
loved
her
best
and
would
think
of
no
more
happy
fate
for
her
than
to
be
the
wife
of
such
a
man
as
george
herbert
he
talked
of
george
so
much
to
jane
that
she
loved
him
without
having
seen
him
george
too
heard
of
jane
and
wished
to
meet
her
and
at
last
after
a
long
time
they
met
each
had
heard
so
much
about
the
other
that
they
seemed
to
know
one
another
already
and
like
the
prince
and
princess
in
a
fairy
tale
they
loved
at
once
and
three
days
later
they
were
married
soon
after
this
george
herbert
was
offered
the
living
of
bemerton
near
salisbury
but
although
he
had
already
made
up
his
mind
to
become
a
priest
he
was
as
yet
only
a
deacon
this
sudden
offer
made
him
fearful
he
began
again
to
question
himself
and
wonder
if
he
was
good
enough
for
such
a
high
calling
for
a
month
he
fasted
and
prayed
over
it
but
in
the
end
laud
bishop
of
london
assured
him
that
the
refusal
of
it
was
a
sin
so
herbert
put
off
his
sword
and
gay
silken
clothes
and
putting
on
the
long
dark
robe
of
a
priest
turned
his
back
for
ever
to
thoughts
of
a
court
life
i
now
look
back
upon
my
aspiring
thoughts
he
said
and
think
myself
more
happy
than
if
i
had
attained
what
i
so
ambitiously
thirsted
for
i
can
now
behold
the
court
with
an
impartial
eye
and
see
plainly
that
it
is
made
up
of
fraud
and
titles
and
flattery
and
many
other
such
empty
imaginary
painted
pleasures
and
having
turned
his
back
on
all
gayety
he
began
the
life
which
earned
for
him
the
name
of
saintly
george
herbert
he
taught
his
people
preached
to
them
and
prayed
with
them
so
lovingly
that
they
loved
him
in
return
some
of
the
meaner
sort
of
his
parish
did
so
love
and
reverence
herbert
that
they
would
let
their
plough
rest
when
herbert
saint
bell
rang
to
prayers
that
they
might
also
offer
their
devotions
to
god
with
him
and
would
then
return
back
to
their
plough
and
his
most
holy
life
was
such
that
it
begot
such
reverence
to
god
and
to
him
that
they
thought
themselves
the
happier
when
they
carried
herbert
blessing
back
with
them
to
their
labour
but
he
did
not
only
preach
he
practised
too
i
must
tell
you
just
one
story
to
show
you
how
he
practiced
herbert
was
very
fond
of
music
he
sang
and
played
too
upon
the
lute
and
viol
one
day
as
he
was
walking
into
salisbury
to
play
with
some
friends
he
saw
a
poor
man
with
a
poorer
horse
which
was
fallen
under
his
load
they
were
both
in
distress
and
needed
present
help
this
herbert
perceiving
put
off
his
canonical
coat
and
helped
the
poor
man
to
unload
and
after
to
load
his
horse
the
poor
man
blest
him
for
it
and
he
blest
the
poor
man
and
was
so
like
the
good
samaritan
that
he
gave
him
money
to
refresh
both
himself
and
his
horse
and
told
him
that
if
he
loved
himself
he
should
be
merciful
to
his
beast
thus
he
left
the
poor
man
and
at
his
coming
to
his
musical
friends
at
salisbury
they
began
to
wonder
that
george
herbert
which
used
to
be
so
trim
and
clean
came
into
that
company
so
soiled
and
discomposed
but
he
told
them
the
occasion
and
when
one
of
the
company
told
him
he
had
disparaged
himself
by
so
dirty
an
employment
his
answer
was
that
the
thought
of
what
he
had
done
would
prove
music
to
him
at
midnight
and
the
omission
of
it
would
have
upbraided
and
made
discord
in
his
conscience
whensoever
he
should
pass
by
that
place
if
i
be
bound
to
pray
for
all
that
be
in
distress
i
am
sure
that
i
am
bound
so
far
as
it
is
in
my
power
to
practice
what
i
pray
for
and
though
i
do
not
wish
for
the
like
occasion
every
day
yet
let
me
tell
you
i
would
not
willingly
pass
one
day
of
my
life
without
comforting
a
sad
soul
or
shewing
mercy
and
i
praise
god
for
this
occasion
now
let
tune
our
instruments
this
story
reminds
us
that
besides
being
a
parson
herbert
was
a
courtier
and
a
fine
gentleman
his
courtly
friends
were
surprised
that
he
should
lower
himself
by
helping
a
poor
man
with
his
own
hands
but
that
is
just
one
thing
that
we
have
to
remember
about
herbert
he
had
nothing
of
the
puritan
in
him
he
was
a
cavalier
a
courtier
yet
he
showed
the
world
that
it
was
possible
to
be
these
and
still
be
a
good
man
he
did
not
believe
that
any
honest
work
was
a
dirty
employment
in
one
of
his
poems
he
says
teach
me
my
god
and
king
in
all
things
thee
to
see
and
what
i
do
in
anything
to
do
it
as
for
thee
all
may
of
thee
partake
nothing
can
be
so
mean
which
with
his
tincture
for
thy
sake
will
not
grow
bright
and
clean
a
servant
with
this
clause
makes
drudgery
divine
who
sweeps
a
room
as
for
thy
laws
makes
that
and
th
action
fine
this
is
the
famous
stone
that
turneth
all
to
gold
for
that
which
god
doth
touch
and
own
can
not
for
less
be
told
i
have
told
you
the
story
about
herbert
and
the
poor
man
in
the
words
of
izaak
walton
the
first
writer
of
a
life
of
george
herbert
i
hope
some
day
you
will
read
that
life
and
also
the
other
books
walton
wrote
for
although
we
have
not
room
for
him
in
this
book
his
books
are
one
of
the
delights
of
our
literature
which
await
you
in
all
herbert
work
among
his
people
his
wife
was
his
companion
and
help
and
the
people
loved
her
as
much
as
they
loved
their
parson
love
followed
her
says
walton
in
all
places
as
inseparably
as
shadows
follow
substances
in
sunshine
besides
living
thus
for
his
people
herbert
almost
rebuilt
the
church
and
rectory
both
of
which
he
found
very
ruined
and
when
he
had
made
an
end
of
rebuilding
he
carved
these
words
upon
the
chimney
in
the
hall
of
the
rectory
if
thou
chance
for
to
find
a
new
house
to
thy
mind
and
built
without
thy
cost
be
good
to
the
poor
as
god
gives
thee
store
and
then
my
labor
not
lost
his
life
one
would
think
was
busy
enough
and
full
enough
yet
amid
it
all
he
found
time
to
write
besides
many
poems
he
wrote
for
his
own
guidance
a
book
called
the
country
parson
it
is
a
book
says
walton
so
full
of
plain
prudent
and
useful
rules
that
that
country
parson
that
can
spare
and
yet
wants
it
is
scarce
excusable
but
herbert
happy
useful
days
at
bemerton
were
all
too
short
in
before
he
had
held
his
living
three
years
he
died
and
was
buried
by
his
sorrowing
people
beneath
the
altar
of
his
own
little
church
it
was
not
until
after
his
death
that
his
poems
were
published
on
his
he
left
the
book
in
which
he
had
written
them
to
a
friend
desire
him
to
read
it
he
said
and
if
he
can
think
it
may
turn
to
the
advantage
of
any
dejected
poor
soul
let
it
be
made
public
if
not
let
him
burn
it
the
book
was
published
under
the
name
of
the
temple
all
the
poems
are
short
except
the
first
called
the
church
porch
from
that
i
will
quote
a
few
lines
it
begins
thou
whose
sweet
youth
and
early
hopes
enchance
thy
rate
and
price
and
mark
thee
for
a
treasure
hearken
unto
a
verser
who
may
chance
ryme
thee
to
good
and
make
a
bait
of
pleasure
a
verse
may
find
him
who
a
sermon
flies
and
turn
delight
into
a
sacrifice
lie
not
but
let
thy
heart
be
true
to
god
thy
mouth
to
it
thy
actions
to
them
both
cowards
tell
lies
and
those
that
fear
the
rod
the
soul
spits
lies
and
froth
dare
to
be
true
nothing
can
need
a
lie
a
fault
which
needs
it
most
grows

thereby
art
thou
a
magistrate
then
be
severe
if
studious

the
king

his

but
a
give
it
a
corner
and
the
clue
undoes
who
fears
to
do
ill
set
himself
to
task
who
fears
to
do
well
sure
should
wear
a
mask
there
is
all
the
strong
courage
in
these
lines
of
the
parson
they
make
us
remember
that
before
he
put
on
his
robe
he
wore
a
sword
they
are
full
of
the
fearless
goodness
that
was
the
mark
of
his
gentle
soul
and
now
to
end
the
chapter
i
will
give
you
another
little
poem
full
of
beauty
and
tenderness
it
is
called
the
pulley
herbert
often
gave
quaint
names
to
his
poems
names
which
at
first
sight
seem
to
have
little
meaning
perhaps
you
may
be
able
to
find
out
why
this
is
called
the
pulley
when
god
at
first
made
man
having
a
glass
of
blessings
standing
by
us
said
he
on
him
all
we
can
let
the
world
riches
which
disperséd
lie
contract
into
a
span
so
strength
first
made
way
then
beauty
flowed
then
wisdom
honour
pleasure
when
almost
all
was
out
god
made
a
stay
perceiving
that
alone
of
all
his
treasure
rest
in
the
bottom
lay
if
i
should
said
he
this
jewel
on
my
creature
he
would
adore
my
gifts
instead
of
me
and
rest
in
nature
not
the
god
of
nature
so
both
should
losers
be
let
him
keep
the
rest
but
keep
them
with
repining
restlessness
let
him
be
rich
and
weary
that
at
least
if
goodness
lead
him
not
yet
weariness
may
toss
him
to
my
breast
chapter
lvi
herrick
and
marvell
of
blossoms
and
bowers
another
poet
of
this
age
robert
herrick
in
himself
joined
the
two
styles
of
poetry
of
which
we
have
been
speaking
for
he
was
both
a
love
poet
and
a
religious
poet
he
was
born
in
and
was
the
son
of
an
old
family
his
father
being
a
london
goldsmith
but
like
herbert
he
lost
his
father
when
he
was
but
a
tiny
child
like
herbert
again
he
went
to
westminster
school
and
later
cambridge
but
before
he
went
to
cambridge
he
was
apprenticed
to
his
uncle
who
was
a
goldsmith
as
his
brother
herrick
father
had
been
robert
however
never
finished
his
apprenticeship
he
found
out
we
may
suppose
that
he
had
no
liking
for
the
jeweler
craft
that
his
hand
was
meant
to
create
jewels
of
another
kind
so
he
left
his
uncle
workshop
and
went
to
cambridge
although
he
was
already
much
beyond
the
usual
age
at
which
boys
then
went
to
college
like
herbert
he
went
to
college
meaning
to
study
for
the
church
but
according
to
our
ideas
he
seems
little
fitted
to
have
been
a
priest
for
although
we
know
little
more
than
a
few
bare
facts
about
herrick
life
when
we
have
read
his
poems
and
looked
at
his
portrait
we
can
draw
for
ourselves
a
clear
picture
of
the
man
and
the
picture
will
not
fit
in
with
our
ideas
of
priesthood
in
some
ways
therefore
as
we
have
seen
though
there
was
an
outward
likeness
between
the
lives
of
herbert
and
of
herrick
it
was
only
an
outwards
likeness
herbert
was
tender
and
kindly
the
very
model
of
a
christian
gentleman
herrick
was
a
jolly
old
pagan
full
of
a
rollicking
joy
in
life
even
in
appearance
these
two
poets
were
different
herbert
was
tall
and
thin
with
a
quiet
face
and
eyes
which
were
truly
homes
of
silent
prayer
in
herrick
face
is
something
gross
his
great
roman
nose
and
thick
curly
hair
seem
to
suit
his
nature
there
is
nothing
spiritual
about
him
after
herrick
left
college
we
know
little
of
his
life
for
eight
or
nine
years
he
lived
in
london
met
ben
jonson
and
all
the
other
poets
and
writers
who
flocked
about
great
ben
he
went
to
court
no
doubt
and
all
the
time
he
wrote
poems
it
was
a
gay
and
cheerful
life
which
when
at
length
he
was
given
the
living
of
dean
prior
in
devonshire
he
found
it
hard
to
leave
it
was
then
that
he
wrote
his
farewell
to
poetry
he
says
i
my
desires
screw
from
thee
and
direct
them
and
my
thought
to
that
sublim
respect
and
conscience
unto
priesthood
it
was
hard
to
go
but
yet
he
pretends
at
least
to
be
resigned
and
he
ends
by
saying
the
crown
of
duty
is
our
duty
well
doing
the
fruit
of
doing
well
farewell
for
eighteen
years
herrick
lived
in
his
devonshire
home
and
we
know
little
of
these
years
but
he
thought
sadly
at
times
of
the
gay
days
that
were
gone
ah
ben
he
writes
to
jonson
say
how
or
when
shall
we
thy
guests
meet
at
those
lyric
feasts
made
at
the
sun
the
dog
the
triple
tun
where
we
such
clusters
had
as
made
us
nobly
wild
not
mad
and
yet
each
verse
of
thine
the
meat
the
frolic
wine
yet
he
was
not
without
comforts
and
companions
in
his
country
parsonage
his
good
and
faithful
servant
prue
kept
house
for
him
and
he
surrounded
himself
with
pets
he
had
a
pet
lamb
a
dog
a
cat
and
even
a
pet
pig
which
he
taught
to
drink
out
of
a
mug
though
clock
to
tell
how
night
draws
hence
i
none
a
cock
i
have
to
sing
how
day
draws
on
i
have
a
maid
my
prue
by
good
luck
sent
to
save
that
little
fates
me
gave
or
lent
a
hen
i
keep
which
day
by
day
tells
when
she
goes
her
long
white
egg
to
lay
a
goose
i
have
which
with
a
jealous
ear
lets
loose
her
tongue
to
tell
what
danger
near
a
lamb
i
keep
tame
with
my
morsels
fed
whose
dam
an
orphan
left
him
lately
dead
a
cat
i
keep
that
plays
about
my
house
grown
fat
with
eating
many
a
mouse
to
these
a
i
do
keep
whereby
i
please
the
more
my
rural
privacy
which
are
but
toys
to
give
my
heart
some
ease
where
care
none
is
slight
things
do
lightly
please
spaniel
but
herrick
did
not
love
his
country
home
and
parish
or
his
people
we
are
told
that
the
gentry
round
about
loved
him
for
his
florid
and
witty
discourses
but
his
people
do
not
seem
to
have
loved
these
same
discourses
for
we
are
also
told
that
one
day
in
anger
he
threw
his
sermon
from
the
pulpit
at
them
because
they
did
not
listen
attentively
he
says
more
discontents
i
never
had
since
i
was
born
than
here
where
i
have
been
and
still
am
sad
in
this
dull
devonshire
yet
though
herrick
hated
devonshire
or
at
least
said
so
it
was
this
same
wild
country
that
called
forth
some
of
his
finest
poems
he
himself
knew
that
for
in
the
next
lines
he
goes
on
to
say
yet
justly
too
i
must
confess
i
invented
such
ennobled
numbers
for
the
press
than
where
i
loathed
so
much
yet
it
is
not
the
ruggedness
of
the
devon
land
we
feel
in
herrick
poems
we
feel
rather
the
beauty
of
flowers
the
warmth
of
sun
the
softness
of
spring
winds
and
see
the
greening
trees
the
morning
dews
the
soft
rains
it
is
as
if
he
had
not
let
his
eyes
wander
over
the
wild
devonshire
moorlands
but
had
confined
them
to
his
own
lovely
garden
and
orchard
meadow
for
he
speaks
of
the
herb
and
tree
the
damasked
meadows
the
silver
shedding
brooks
hardly
any
english
poet
has
written
so
tenderly
of
flowers
as
herrick
one
of
the
best
known
of
these
flower
poems
is
to
daffodils
fair
daffodils
we
weep
to
see
you
haste
away
so
soon
as
yet
the
sun
has
not
attain
his
noon
stay
stay
until
the
hasting
day
has
run
but
to
the
and
having
pray
together
we
will
go
with
you
along
we
have
short
time
to
stay
as
you
we
have
as
short
a
spring
as
quick
a
growth
to
meet
decay
as
you
or
anything
we
die
as
your
hours
do
and
dry
away
like
to
the
summer
rain
or
as
the
pearls
of
morning
dew
to
be
found
again
and
here
is
part
of
a
song
for
may
morning
get
up
get
up
for
shame
the
blooming
morn
upon
her
wings
presents
the
god
unshorn
see
how
aurora
throws
her
fair
colours
through
the
air
get
up
sweet
and
see
the
dew
bespangling
herb
and
tree
each
flower
has
wept
and
bow
toward
the
east
above
an
hour
since
yet
you
not
dress
nay
not
so
much
as
out
of
bed
when
all
the
birds
have
matins
said
and
sung
their
thankful
hymns
is
sin
nay
profanation
to
keep
in
whenas
a
thousand
virgins
on
this
day
spring
sooner
than
the
lark
to
fetch
in
may
rise
and
put
on
your
foliage
and
be
seen
to
come
forth
like
the
fresh
and
green
and
sweet
as
flora
take
no
care
for
jewels
for
your
gown
or
hair
fear
not
the
leaves
will
strew
gems
in
abundance
upon
you
besides
the
childhood
of
the
day
has
kept
against
you
come
some
orient
pearls
unwept
come
and
receive
them
while
the
light
hangs
on
the
of
the
night
and

on
the
eastern
hill
retires
himself
or
else
stands
still
till

forth

brief

beads
are
best
when
once
we
go
another
poem
of
herrick
is
gather
ye
rosebuds
while
ye
may
old
time
is
still
and
this
same
flower
that
smiles
will
be
dying
the
glorious
lamp
of
heaven
the
sun
the
higher
he
the
sooner
will
his
race
be
run
and
nearer
he
to
setting
that
age
is
best
which
is
the
first
when
youth
and
blood
are
warmer
but
being
spent
the
worse
and
worst
times
still
succeed
the
former
then
be
not
coy
but
use
your
time
and
while
ye
may
go
marry
for
having
lost
but
once
your
prime
you
may
for
ever
tarry
herrick
only
published
one
book
he
called
it
the
hesperides
or
the
works
both
human
and
divine
the
divine
part
although
published
in
the
same
book
has
a
separate
name
being
called

noble

the
hesperides
from
whom
he
took
the
name
of
his
book
were

maidens
who
dwelt
in
a
beautiful
garden
far
away
on
the
verge
of
the
ocean
the
maidens
sang
beautifully
so
herrick
took
their
name
for
his
book
for
it
might
well
be
that
the
songs
they
sang
were
such
as
his
this
garden
of
the
hesperides
was
sometimes
thought
to
be
the
same
as
the
fabled
island
of
atlantis
of
which
we
have
already
heard
and
it
was
here
that
guarded
by
a
dreadful
dragon
grew
the
golden
apples
which
earth
gave
to
hera
on
her
marriage
with
zeus
the
hesperides
is
a
collection
of
more
than
a
thousand
short
poems
a
few
of
which
you
have
already
read
in
this
chapter
they
are
not
connected
with
each
other
but
tell
of
all
manner
of
things
herrick
was
a
religious
poet
too
and
here
is
something
that
he
wrote
for
children
in
his
noble
numbers
it
is
called
to
his
saviour
a
child
a
present
by
a
child
go
pretty
child
and
bear
this
flower
unto
thy
little
saviour
and
tell
him
by
that
bud
now
blown
he
is
the
rose
of
sharon
known
when
thou
hast
said
so
stick
it
there
upon
his
bib
or
stomacher
and
tell
him
for
good
hansel
too
that
thou
hast
brought
a
whistle
new
made
of
a
clear
straight
oaten
reed
to
charm
his
cries
at
time
of
need
tell
him
for
coral
thou
hast
none
but
if
thou
hadst
he
should
have
one
but
poor
thou
art
and
known
to
be
even
as
moneyless
as
he
lastly
if
thou
canst
win
a
kiss
from
those
mellifluous
lips
of
his
then
never
take
a
second
one
to
spoil
the
first
impression
herrick
wrote
also
several
graces
for
children
here
is
one
what
god
gives
and
what
we
take
is
a
gift
for
christ
his
sake
be
the
meal
of
beans
and
peas
god
be
thanked
for
those
and
these
have
we
flesh
or
have
we
fish
all
are
fragments
from
his
dish
he
his
church
save
and
the
king
and
our
peace
here
like
a
spring
make
it
ever
flourishing
while
herrick
lived
his
quiet
dull
life
and
wrote
poetry
in
the
depths
of
devonshire
the
country
was
being
torn
asunder
and
tossed
from
horror
to
horror
by
the
great
civil
war
men
took
sides
and
fought
for
parliament
or
for
king
year
by
year
the
quarrel
grew
what
was
begun
at
edgehill
ended
at
naseby
where
the
king
cause
was
utterly
lost
then
although
herrick
took
no
part
in
the
fighting
he
suffered
with
the
vanquished
for
he
was
a
royalist
at
heart
he
was
turned
out
of
his
living
to
make
room
for
a
parliament
man
he
left
this
parish
without
regret
deanbourne
farewell
i
never
look
to
see
deane
or
thy
warty
incivility
thy
rocky
bottom
that
doth
tear
thy
streams
and
makes
them
frantic
to
all
extremes
to
my
content
i
never
should
behold
were
thy
streams
silver
or
thy
rocks
all
gold
rocky
thou
art
and
rocky
we
discover
thy
men
and
rocky
are
thy
ways
all
over
o
men
o
manners
now
and
ever
known
to
be
a
rocky
generation
a
people
currish
churlish
as
the
seas
and
rude
almost
as
rudest
savages
with
whom
i
did
and
may
when
rocks
turn
to
rivers
rivers
turn
to
men
hastening
to
london
he
threw
off
his
sober
priest
robe
and
once
more
putting
on
the
gay
dress
worn
by
the
gentlemen
of
his
day
he
forgot
the
troubles
and
the
duties
of
a
country
parson
rejoicing
in
his
freedom
he
cried
london
my
home
is
though
by
hard
fate
sent
into
a
long
and
irksome
banishment
yet
since
called
back
henceforward
let
me
be
o
native
country
repossess
by
thee
he
had
no
money
but
he
had
many
wealthy
friends
so
he
lived
we
may
believe
merrily
enough
for
the
next
fifteen
years
it
was
during
these
years
that
the
hesperides
was
first
published
although
for
a
long
time
before
many
people
had
known
his
poems
for
they
had
been
handed
about
among
his
friends
in
manuscript
so
the
years
passed
for
herrick
we
hardly
know
how
in
the
great
world
cromwell
died
and
charles
ii
returned
to
england
to
claim
the
throne
of
his
fathers
then
it
would
seem
that
herrick
had
not
found
all
the
joy
he
had
hoped
for
in
london
for
two
years
later
although
rocks
had
not
turned
to
rivers
nor
rivers
to
men
he
went
back
to
his
loathed
devonshire
after
that
all
that
we
know
of
him
is
that
at
dean
prior
robert
herrick
vicker
was
buried
ye
day
of
october
thus
in
twilight
ends
the
life
of
the
greatest
lyric
poet
of
the
seventeenth
century
all
the
lyric
poets
of
whom
i
have
told
you
were
royalists
but
the
puritans
too
had
their
poets
and
before
ending
this
chapter
i
would
like
to
tell
you
a
little
of
andrew
marvell
a
parliamentary
poet
if
herrick
was
a
lover
of
flowers
marvell
was
a
lover
of
gardens
woods
and
meadows
the
garden
poet
he
has
been
called
he
felt
himself
in
touch
with
nature
thus
i
easy
philosopher
among
the
birds
and
trees
confer
and
little
now
to
make
me
wants
or
of
the
fowls
or
of
the
plants
give
me
but
wings
as
they
and
i
straight
floating
in
the
air
shall
fly
or
turn
me
but
and
you
shall
see
i
was
but
an
inverted
tree
house
to
the
lord
fairfax
yet
although
marvell
loved
nature
he
did
not
live
like
herrick
far
from
the
stir
of
war
but
took
his
part
in
the
strife
of
the
times
he
was
an
important
man
in
his
day
he
was
known
to
cromwell
and
was
a
friend
of
milton
a
poet
much
greater
than
himself
he
was
a
member
of
parliament
and
wrote
much
prose
but
the
quarrels
in
the
cause
of
which
it
was
written
are
matters
of
bygone
days
and
although
some
of
it
is
still
interesting
it
is
for
his
poetry
rather
that
we
remember
and
love
him
although
marvell
was
a
parliamentarian
he
did
not
love
cromwell
blindly
and
he
could
admire
what
was
fine
in
king
charles
he
could
say
of
cromwell
though
his
government
did
a
tyrant
resemble
he
made
england
great
and
his
enemies
tremble
dialogue
between
two
horses
and
no
one
perhaps
wrote
with
more
grave
sorrow
of
the
death
of
charles
than
did
marvell
and
that
too
in
a
poem
which
strangely
enough
was
written
in
honor
of
cromwell
he
nothing
common
did
or
mean
upon
that
memorable
scene
but
with
his
keener
eye
the
axe
edge
did
try
nor
called
the
gods
with
vulgar
spite
to
vindicate
his
helpless
right
but
bowed
his
comely
head
down
as
upon
a
bed
horatian
ode
upon
cromwell
return
from
ireland
at
cromwell
death
he
wrote
thee
many
ages
hence
in
martial
verse
shall
the
english
soldier
ere
he
charge
rehearse
singing
of
thee
inflame
himself
to
fight
and
with
the
name
of
cromwell
armies
fright
the
death
of
the
lord
protector
but
all
marvell
writings
were
not
political
and
one
of
his
prettiest
poems
was
written
about
a
girl
mourning
for
a
lost
pet
the
wanton
troopers
riding
by
have
shot
my
fawn
and
it
will
die
ungentle
men
they
can
not
thrive
who
killed
thee
thou
didst
alive
them
any
harm
alas
nor
could
thy
death
yet
do
them
any
good
with
sweetest
milk
and
sugar
first
i
it
at
my
own
fingers
nurs
and
as
it
grew
so
every
day
it
wax
more
sweet
and
white
than
they
it
had
so
sweet
a
breath
and
oft
i
blushed
to
see
its
foot
so
soft
and
white
shall
i
say
than
my
hand
nay
any
lady
of
the
land
it
is
a
wondrous
thing
how
fleet
was
on
those
little
silver
feet
with
what
a
pretty
skipping
grace
it
oft
would
challenge
me
to
race
and
when
had
left
me
far
away
stay
and
run
again
and
stay
for
it
was
nimbler
much
than
hinds
and
trod
as
if
on
the
four
winds
i
have
a
garden
of
my
own
but
so
with
roses
overgrown
and
lilies
that
you
would
it
guess
to
be
a
little
wilderness
and
all
the
of
the
year
it
only
loved
to
be
there
among
the
lilies
i
have
sought
it
oft
where
it
should
lie
yet
could
not
till
itself
would
rise
find
it
although
before
mine
eyes
for
in
the
flaxen
lilies
shade
it
like
a
bank
of
lilies
laid
upon
the
roses
it
would
feed
until
its
lips
even
seemed
to
bleed
and
then
to
me
boldly
trip
and
plant
those
roses
on
my
lip
now
my
sweet
fawn
in
vanish
to
whither
the
swans
and
turtles
go
in
fair
elysium
to
endure
with
lambs
and
ermines
pure
o
do
not
run
too
fast
for
i
will
but
bespeak
thy
grave
and
die
after
the
restoration
marvell
wrote
satires
a
kind
of
poem
of
which
you
had
an
early
and
mild
example
in
the
fable
of
the
two
mice
by
surrey
a
kind
of
poem
of
which
we
will
soon
hear
much
more
in
these
satires
marvell
poured
out
all
the
wrath
of
a
puritan
upon
the
evils
of
his
day
marvell
satires
were
so
witty
and
so
outspoken
that
once
or
twice
he
was
in
danger
of
punishment
because
of
them
but
once
at
least
the
king
himself
saved
a
book
of
his
from
being
destroyed
for
by
every
one
from
the
king
down
to
the
tradesman
his
books
were
read
with
great
pleasure
yet
he
had
many
enemies
and
when
he
died
suddenly
in
august
many
people
though
that
he
had
been
poisoned
he
was
the
last
we
may
say
of
the
lyric
poets
besides
the
lyric
writers
there
were
many
prose
writers
in
the
seventeenth
century
who
are
among
the
men
to
be
remembered
but
their
books
although
some
day
you
will
love
them
would
not
interest
you
yet
they
tell
no
story
they
are
long
they
have
not
like
poetry
a
lilt
or
rhythm
to
carry
one
on
it
would
be
an
effort
to
read
them
if
i
tried
to
explain
to
you
wherein
the
charm
of
them
lies
i
fear
the
charm
would
fly
for
it
is
impossible
to
imprison
the
sunbeam
or
find
the
foundations
of
the
rainbow
it
is
better
therefore
to
leave
these
books
until
the
years
to
come
in
which
it
will
be
no
effort
to
read
them
but
a
joy
chapter
lvii
milton
sight
and
growth
there
is
but
one
milton
there
is
too
but
one
shakespeare
yet
john
milton
far
more
than
william
shakespeare
stands
a
lonely
figure
in
our
literature
shakespeare
was
a
dramatist
among
dramatists
we
can
see
how
there
were
those
who
led
up
to
him
and
others
again
who
led
away
from
him
from
each
he
differs
in
being
greater
he
outshines
them
all
shakespeare
was
a
man
among
men
he
loved
and
sinned
with
men
he
was
homely
and
kindly
and
we
can
take
him
to
our
hearts
milton
both
in
his
life
and
work
was
cold
and
lonely
he
was
a
master
without
scholars
a
leader
without
followers
him
we
can
admire
but
can
not
love
with
an
understanding
love
yet
although
we
love
shakespeare
we
can
find
throughout
all
his
works
hardly
a
line
upon
which
we
can
place
a
finger
and
say
here
shakespeare
speaks
of
himself
here
he
shows
what
he
himself
thought
and
felt
shakespeare
understood
human
nature
so
well
that
he
could
see
through
another
eyes
and
so
forget
himself
but
over
and
over
again
in
milton
work
we
see
himself
over
and
over
again
we
can
say
here
milton
speaks
of
himself
here
he
shows
us
his
own
heart
his
own
pain
he
is
one
of
the
most
of
all
poets
he
has
none
of
the
dramatic
power
of
shakespeare
he
can
not
look
through
another
eyes
so
he
sees
things
only
from
one
standpoint
and
that
his
own
he
stands
far
apart
from
us
and
is
almost
inhumanly
cold
that
is
the
reason
why
so
many
of
us
find
him
hard
to
love
raleigh
when
on
a
bleak
december
day
in
more
than
three
hundred
years
ago
milton
was
born
elizabeth
was
dead
and
james
of
scotland
sat
upon
the
throne
but
many
of
the
great
elizabethans
still
lived
shakespeare
was
still
writing
still
acting
although
he
had
become
a
man
of
wealth
and
importance
and
the
owner
of
new
place
ben
jonson
was
at
the
very
height
of
his
fame
the
favorite
alike
of
court
and
commons
bacon
was
just
rising
to
power
and
greatness
his
novum
organum
still
to
come
raleigh
in
prison
was
eating
his
heart
out
in
the
desire
for
freedom
trying
to
while
away
the
dreary
hours
with
chemical
experiments
his
great
history
not
yet
begun
of
the
crowd
of
lyric
writers
some
were
boys
at
college
some
but
children
in
the
nursery
and
some
still
unborn
yet
in
spite
of
the
many
writers
who
lived
at
or
about
the
same
time
milton
stands
alone
in
our
literature
john
milton
was
the
son
of
a
london
scrivener
that
is
a
kind
of
lawyer
he
was
and
a
puritan
milton
home
however
must
have
been
brighter
than
many
a
puritan
home
for
his
father
loved
music
and
not
only
played
well
but
also
composed
he
taught
his
son
to
play
too
and
all
through
his
life
milton
loved
music
john
was
a
pretty
little
boy
with
long
golden
brown
hair
a
fair
face
and
dark
gray
eyes
but
to
many
a
strict
puritan
beauty
was
an
abomination
and
we
are
told
that
one
of
schoolmasters
was
a
puritan
in
essex
who
cut
his
hair
short
no
doubt
to
him
a
boy
with
long
hair
was
unseemly
john
was
the
eldest
and
much
beloved
son
of
his
father
who
perhaps
petted
and
spoiled
him
he
was
clever
as
well
as
pretty
and
already
at
the
age
of
ten
he
was
looked
upon
by
his
family
as
a
poet
he
was
very
studious
for
besides
going
to
paul
school
he
had
a
private
tutor
even
with
that
he
was
not
satisfied
but
studied
alone
far
into
the
night
when
he
went
to
schoole
when
he
was
very
young
we
are
told
he
studied
hard
and
sate
up
very
late
commonly
till
twelve
or
one
at
night
and
his
father
ordered
the
mayde
to
sitt
up
for
him
and
in
those
years
he
composed
many
copies
of
verses
which
might
well
become
a
riper
age
we
can
imagine
to
ourselves
the
silence
of
the
house
when
all
the
puritan
household
had
been
long
abed
we
can
picture
the
warm
quiet
room
where
sits
the
little
boy
poring
over
his
books
by
the
light
of
flickering
candles
while
in
the
shadow
a
puritan
woman
waits
she
sits
very
straight
in
her
chair
her
worn
hands
are
folded
her
eyes
heavy
with
sleep
sometimes
she
nods
then
with
a
start
she
shakes
herself
wide
awake
again
murmuring
softly
that
it
is
no
hour
for
any
christian
body
to
be
out
o
bed
wondering
that
her
master
should
allow
so
young
a
child
to
keep
so
long
over
his
books
still
she
has
her
orders
so
with
a
patient
sigh
she
folds
her
hands
again
and
waits
thus
early
did
milton
begin
to
shape
his
own
course
and
to
live
a
life
apart
from
others
at
sixteen
milton
went
to
christ
college
cambridge
and
here
he
earned
for
himself
the
name
of
the
lady
of
christ
both
because
of
his
beautiful
face
and
slender
figure
and
because
he
stood
haughtily
aloof
from
amusements
which
seemed
to
him
coarse
or
bad
in
going
to
cambridge
milton
had
meant
to
study
for
the
church
but
all
through
life
he
stood
for
liberty
he
thought
that
man
was
made
only
for
rebellion
said
a
later
writer
as
a
child
he
had
gone
his
own
way
and
as
he
grew
older
he
found
it
harder
and
harder
to
agree
with
all
that
the
church
taught
till
coming
to
some
maturity
of
years
and
perceiving
what
tyranny
had
invaded
in
the
church
that
he
who
would
take
orders
must
subscribe
slaves
and
take
an
oath
withal
i
thought
it
better
to
prefer
a
blameless
silence
before
the
sacred
office
of
speaking
bought
and
begun
with
servitude
and
forswearing
thus
was
he
he
says
by
the
prelates
milton
could
not
with
a
free
conscience
become
a
clergyman
so
having
taken
his
degree
he
went
home
to
his
father
who
now
lived
in
the
country
at
horton
he
left
cambridge
without
regrets
no
thrill
of
pleasure
seemed
to
have
warmed
his
heart
in
after
days
when
he
looked
back
upon
the
young
years
spent
beside
the
cam
reason
of
church
government
book
ii
milton
went
home
to
his
father
house
without
any
settled
plan
of
life
he
had
not
made
up
his
mind
what
he
was
to
be
he
was
only
sure
that
he
could
not
be
a
clergyman
his
father
was
well
off
but
not
wealthy
he
had
no
great
estates
to
manage
and
he
must
have
wished
his
eldest
son
to
do
and
be
something
in
the
world
yet
he
did
not
urge
it
upon
him
milton
himself
however
was
not
quite
at
rest
as
his
sonnet
on
his
being
arrived
to
the
age
of
shows
how
soon
hath
time
the
subtle
thief
of
youth
stolen
on
his
wing
my
year
my
hasting
days
fly
on
with
full
career
but
my
late
spring
no
bud
or
blossom
perhaps
my
semblance
might
deceive
the
truth
that
i
to
manhood
am
arriv
so
near
and
inward
ripeness
doth
much
less
appear
that
some
more
timely
happy
spirits
yet
be
it
less
or
more
or
soon
or
slow
it
shall
be
still
in
strictest
measure
even
to
that
same
lot
however
mean
or
high
toward
which
time
leads
me
and
the
will
of
heaven
all
is
if
i
have
grace
to
use
it
so
as
ever
in
my
great
eye
yet
dissatisfied
as
he
sometimes
was
he
was
very
sure
of
himself
and
for
five
years
he
let
his
wings
grow
as
he
himself
said
but
these
years
were
not
altogether
lost
for
if
both
day
and
night
milton
roamed
the
meadows
about
his
home
in
seeming
idleness
he
was
drinking
in
all
the
beauty
of
earth
and
sky
flower
and
field
storing
his
memory
with
sights
and
sounds
that
were
to
be
a
treasure
to
him
in
after
days
he
studied
hard
too
ranging
at
will
through
greek
and
latin
literature
no
delay
no
rest
no
care
or
thought
almost
of
anything
holds
me
aside
until
i
reach
the
end
i
am
making
for
and
round
off
as
it
were
some
great
period
of
my
studies
he
says
to
a
friend
and
as
the
outcome
of
these
five
fallow
years
milton
has
left
us
some
of
his
most
beautiful
poems
they
have
not
the
stately
grandeur
of
his
later
works
but
they
are
natural
and
easy
and
at
times
full
of
a
joyousness
which
we
never
find
in
him
again
and
before
we
can
admire
his
great
poem
which
he
wrote
later
we
may
love
the
beauty
of
il
penseroso
and
lycidas
which
he
wrote
now
and
il
penseroso
are
two
poems
which
picture
two
moods
in
which
the
poet
looks
at
life
they
are
two
moods
which
come
to
every
one
the
mirthful
and
the
sad
pictures
the
happy
mood
here
the
man
who
has
in
his
heart
cause
for
contentment
sings
and
the
poem
fairly
dances
with
delight
of
being
as
it
follows
the
day
from
dawn
till
evening
shadows
fall
it
begins
by
bidding
loathed
melancholy
begone
horrid
shapes
and
shrieks
and
sights
unholy
and
by
bidding
come
mirth
haste
thee
nymph
and
bring
with
thee
jest
and
youthful
jollity
quips
and
cranks
and
wanton
wiles
nods
and
becks
and
wretchéd
smiles
such
as
hang
on
hebe
cheek
and
love
to
live
in
dimple
sleek
sport
that
wrinkled
care
derides
and
laughter
holding
both
his
sides
come
and
trip
it
as
ye
go
on
the
light
fantastic
toe
to
hear
the
lark
begin
his
flight
and
singing
startle
the
dull
night
from
his
in
the
skies
till
the
dappled
dawn
doth
rise
these
are
a
few
lines
from
the
opening
of
the
poem
which
you
must
read
for
yourselves
for
if
i
quoted
all
that
is
beautiful
in
it
i
should
quote
the
whole
il
penseroso
pictures
the
thoughtful
mood
or
mood
of
gentle
melancholy
here
mirth
is
banished
hence
fair
deluding
joys
the
brood
of
folly
and
hail
divinest
melancholy
the
poem
moves
with
more
stately
measure
with
even
step
and
musing
gait
from
evening
through
the
moonlit
night
till
morn
it
ends
with
the
poet
desire
to
live
a
peaceful
studious
life
but
let
my
due
feet
never
fail
to
walk
the
studious
cloisters
pale
and
love
the
high
embowéd
roof
with
antique
pillars
massy
proof
and
storied
windows
richly
dight
casting
a
dim
religious
light
there
let
the
pealing
organ
blow
to
the
choir
below
in
service
high
and
anthem
clear
as
may
with
sweetness
through
mine
ear
dissolve
me
into
ecstacies
and
bring
all
heaven
before
mine
eyes
in
lycidas
milton
mourns
the
death
of
a
friend
who
was
drowned
while
crossing
the
irish
channel
he
took
the
name
from
an
italian
poem
which
told
of
the
sad
death
of
another
lycidas
the
verse
moves
with
even
more
stately
measure
than
il
penseroso
bitter
constraint
and
sad
occasion
dear
compels
me
to
disturb
your
season
due
for
lycidas
is
dead
dead
ere
his
prime
young
lycidas
and
hath
not
left
his
peer
who
would
not
sing
for
lycidas
he
knew
himself
to
sing
and
build
the
lofty
rhyme
fame
is
the
spur
that
the
clear
spirit
doth
raise
that
last
infirmity
of
noble
minds
to
scorn
delights
and
live
laborious
days
but
the
fair
guerdon
when
we
hope
to
find
and
think
to
burst
out
into
sudden
blaze
comes
the
blind
fury
with
th
abhorréd
shears
and
slits
the
life
it
was
during
these
early
years
spent
at
horton
too
that
milton
wrote
his
masque
of
comus
it
is
strange
to
find
a
puritan
poet
writing
a
masque
for
puritans
looked
darkly
on
all
acting
it
is
strange
to
find
that
in
spite
of
the
puritan
dislike
to
acting
the
last
and
perhaps
the
best
masque
in
our
language
should
be
written
by
a
puritan
and
that
not
ten
years
before
all
the
theaters
in
the
land
were
closed
by
puritan
orders
but
although
in
many
ways
milton
was
sternly
puritan
these
were
only
the
better
ways
he
had
no
hatred
of
beauty
god
has
instilled
into
me
a
vehement
love
of
the
beautiful
he
says
the
masque
of
comus
was
written
for
a
great
entertainment
given
by
the
earl
of
bridgewater
at
ludlow
castle
and
three
of
his
children
took
part
in
it
in
a
darksome
wood
so
the
story
runs
the
enchanter
comus
lived
with
his
rabble
rout
half
brute
half
man
for
to
all
who
passed
through
the
wood
comus
offered
a
glass
from
which
if
any
drank
their
human
countenance
th
express
resemblance
of
the
gods
is
changed
into
some
brutish
form
of
wolf
or
bear
or
ounce
or
tiger
hog
or
bearded
goat
all
other
parts
remaining
as
they
were
and
they
forgetting
their
home
and
friends
henceforth
live
riotously
with
comus
through
this
wood
a
lady
and
her
two
brothers
pass
and
on
the
way
the
lady
is
separated
from
her
brothers
and
loses
her
way
as
she
wanders
about
she
is
discovered
by
comus
who
disguising
himself
as
a
shepherd
offers
her
shelter
in
his
low
but
loyal
cottage
the
lady
innocent
and
trusting
follows
him
but
instead
of
leading
her
to
a
cottage
he
leads
her
to
his
palace
there
the
lady
is
placed
in
an
enchanted
chair
from
which
she
can
not
rise
and
comus
tempts
her
to
drink
from
his
magic
glass
the
lady
refuses
and
with
his
magic
wand
comus
turns
her
to
seeming
stone
meanwhile
the
brothers
have
met
a
guardian
spirit
also
disguised
as
a
shepherd
and
he
warns
them
of
their
sister
danger
guided
by
him
they
set
out
to
find
her
reaching
the
palace
they
rush
in
sword
in
hand
they
dash
the
magic
glass
to
the
ground
and
break
it
in
pieces
and
put
comus
and
his
rabble
to
flight
but
though
the
lady
is
thus
saved
she
remains
motionless
and
stony
in
her
chair
what
have
ye
let
the
false
enchanter
scape
the
guardian
spirit
cries
oh
ye
mistook
ye
should
have
snatched
his
wand
and
bound
him
fast
without
his
rod
reversed
and
muttered
incantation
they
can
not
free
the
lady
yet
there
is
another
means
sabrina
the
nymph
of
the
severn
may
save
her
so
the
spirit
calls
upon
her
for
aid
sabrina
fair
listen
where
thou
art
sitting
under
the
glassy
cool
translucent
wave
in
twisted
braids
of
lilies
knitting
the
loose
train
of
thy
hair
listen
for
dear
honour
sake
goddess
of
the
silver
lake
listen
and
save
sabrina
comes
and
sprinkling
water
on
the
lady
breaks
the
charm
brightest
lady
look
on
me
thus
i
sprinkle
on
thy
breast
drops
that
from
my
fountain
pure
i
have
kept
of
precious
cure
thrice
upon
thy
fingers
tip
thrice
upon
thy
rubied
lip
next
this
marble
venomed
seat
smeared
with
gums
of
glutinous
heat
i
touch
with
chaste
palms
moist
and
cold
now
the
spell
hath
lost
its
hold
the
lady
is
free
and
greatly
rejoicing
the
guardian
spirit
leads
her
with
her
brothers
safe
to
their
father
home
all
these
poems
of
which
i
have
told
you
milton
wrote
during
the
quiet
years
spent
at
horton
but
at
length
these
days
came
to
an
end
he
began
to
feel
his
life
in
the
country
cramped
and
narrow
he
longed
to
go
out
into
the
great
wide
world
and
see
something
of
all
the
beauties
and
wonder
of
it
italy
which
had
called
so
many
of
our
poets
called
him
once
more
his
kindly
father
let
him
do
as
he
would
he
gave
him
money
provided
him
with
a
servant
and
sent
him
forth
on
his
travels
for
more
than
a
year
milton
wandered
chiefly
among
the
sunny
cities
of
italy
he
meant
to
stray
still
further
to
sicily
and
greece
but
news
from
home
called
him
back
the
sad
news
of
civil
war
i
thought
it
base
he
said
that
while
my
were
fighting
at
home
for
liberty
i
should
be
traveling
abroad
at
ease
when
milton
returned
home
he
did
not
go
back
to
horton
but
set
up
house
in
london
here
he
began
to
teach
his
two
nephews
his
sister
children
who
were
boys
of
nine
and
ten
their
father
had
died
their
mother
married
again
and
milton
not
only
taught
the
boys
but
took
them
to
live
with
him
he
found
pleasure
it
would
seem
in
teaching
for
soon
his
little
class
grew
and
he
began
to
teach
other
boys
the
sons
of
friends
milton
was
a
good
master
but
a
severe
one
the
boys
were
kept
long
hours
at
their
lessons
and
we
are
told
that
in
a
time
they
could
read
a
latin
author
at
sight
and
within
three
years
they
went
through
the
best
latin
and
greek
poets
but
as
he
was
severe
on
one
hand
so
he
was
most
familiar
and
free
in
his
conversation
to
those
to
whom
most
sour
in
his
way
of
education
he
himself
showed
the
example
of
hard
study
and
spare
diet
for
besides
teaching
the
boys
he
worked
and
wrote
steadily
study
being
ever
the
grand
affair
of
his
life
only
now
and
again
he
went
to
see
young
sparks
of
his
acquaintance
and
now
and
then
to
keep
a
it
is
scarce
to
be
imagined
that
a
in
which
john
milton
took
part
could
have
been
very
riotous
then
after
milton
had
been
leading
this
severe
quiet
life
for
about
four
years
a
strange
thing
happened
one
day
he
set
off
on
a
journey
he
told
no
one
why
he
went
every
one
thought
it
was
but
a
pleasure
jaunt
he
was
away
about
a
month
then
home
he
returns
a
married
man
that
went
out
a
bachelor
we
can
imagine
how
surprised
the
little
boys
would
be
to
find
that
their
grave
teacher
of
had
brought
home
a
wife
a
wife
too
who
was
little
more
than
a
girl
a
few
years
older
than
themselves
and
as
it
was
a
surprise
to
them
it
is
still
a
surprise
to
all
who
read
and
write
about
milton
life
to
this
day
with
the
new
wife
came
several
of
her
friends
and
so
the
quiet
house
was
made
gay
with
feasting
and
merriment
for
a
few
days
for
strange
to
say
milton
the
stern
puritan
had
married
a
royalist
lady
the
daughter
of
a
cavalier
after
these
few
merry
days
the
gay
friends
left
and
the
young
bride
remained
behind
with
her
grave
and
learned
husband
in
her
new
quiet
home
but
to
poor
little
mary
milton
used
to
a
great
house
and
much
merry
coming
and
going
the
life
she
now
led
seemed
dull
beyond
bearing
she
was
not
clever
indeed
she
was
rather
stupid
so
after
having
led
a
philosophical
life
for
about
a
month
she
begged
to
be
allowed
to
go
back
to
her
mother
milton
let
he
go
on
the
understanding
that
she
should
return
to
him
in
a
month
or
two
but
the
time
appointed
came
and
went
without
any
sign
of
a
returning
wife
milton
wrote
to
her
and
got
no
answer
several
times
he
wrote
and
still
no
answer
then
he
sent
a
messenger
but
the
messenger
returned
without
an
answer
or
at
least
without
a
pleasing
one
he
had
indeed
been
dismissed
with
some
sort
of
contempt
it
would
seem
the
cavalier
family
regretted
having
given
a
daughter
in
marriage
to
the
puritan
poet
the
poet
on
his
side
now
resolved
to
cast
out
forever
from
his
heart
and
home
his
truant
wife
he
set
himself
harder
than
before
to
the
task
of
writing
and
teaching
he
hid
his
aching
heart
and
hurt
pride
as
best
he
might
beneath
a
calm
and
stern
bearing
but
life
had
changed
for
him
up
to
this
time
all
had
gone
as
he
wished
ever
since
when
a
boy
of
twelve
he
had
sat
till
midnight
over
his
books
with
a
patient
beside
him
those
around
had
smoothed
his
path
in
life
for
him
his
will
had
been
law
until
a
girl
of
seventeen
defied
him
time
went
on
the
king
cause
was
all
but
hopeless
many
a
cavalier
had
lost
all
in
his
defense
among
them
those
of
mary
milton
family
driven
from
their
home
knowing
hardly
where
to
turn
for
shelter
they
bethought
them
of
mary
slighted
husband
he
was
on
the
winning
side
and
a
man
of
growing
importance
beneath
his
roof
mary
at
least
would
be
safe
the
poor
little
runaway
wife
we
may
believe
was
afraid
to
face
her
angry
husband
but
helped
both
by
his
friends
and
her
own
a
meeting
was
arranged
milton
had
a
friend
to
whose
house
he
often
went
and
in
this
house
his
wife
was
hid
one
day
when
the
poet
came
to
pay
a
visit
while
milton
waited
for
his
friend
he
was
surprised
for
when
the
door
opened
there
came
from
the
adjoining
room
not
his
friend
but
one
whom
he
thought
to
have
never
seen
more
mary
his
wife
came
to
him
and
sinking
upon
her
knees
before
him
begged
to
be
forgiven
long
after
in
his
great
poem
milton
seems
to
describe
the
scene
when
he
makes
adam
cry
out
to
eve
after
the
fall
out
of
my
sight
thou
serpent
that
name
best
befits
thee
but
eve
not
so
repulsed
with
tears
that
ceased
not
flowing
and
tresses
all
disordered
at
his
feet
fell
humble
and

milton
thus
took
back
to
his
home
his
wandering
wife
and
not
her
only
but
also
her
father
mother
and
homeless
brothers
and
sisters
so
although
he
had
moved
to
a
larger
house
it
was
now
full
to

besides
all
this
royalist
family
he
had

his

and
his
own
old
father
chapter
lviii
milton
darkness
and
death
and
now
for
twenty
years
the
pen
of
milton
was
used
not
for
poetry
but
for
prose
the
poet
became
a
politician
victory
was
still
uncertain
and
milton
poured
out
book
after
book
in
support
of
the
puritan
cause
these
books
are
full
of
wrath
and
scorn
and
all
the
bitter
passion
of
the
time
they
have
hardly
a
place
in
true
literature
so
we
may
pass
them
over
glad
that
milton
found
it
possible
to
spend
his
bitterness
in
prose
and
leave
his
poetry
what
it
is
one
only
of
his
prose
works
is
still
remembered
and
still
read
for
its
splendid
english
that
is
areopagitica
a
passionate
appeal
for
a
free
press
milton
desired
that
a
man
should
have
not
only
freedom
of
thought
but
freedom
to
write
down
and
print
and
publish
these
thoughts
but
the
rulers
of
england
ever
since
printing
had
been
introduced
had
thought
otherwise
and
by
law
no
book
could
be
printed
until
it
had
been
licensed
and
no
man
might
set
up
a
printing
press
without
permission
from
government
to
milton
this
was
tyranny
as
good
almost
kill
a
man
as
kill
a
good
book
he
said
and
again
give
me
the
liberty
to
know
to
utter
and
to
argue
freely
according
to
my
conscience
above
all
liberties
he
held
the
licensing
law
in
contempt
and
to
show
his
contempt
he
published
areopagitica
without
a
license
and
without
giving
the
printer
or
bookseller
name
it
was
not
the
first
time
milton
had
done
this
and
his
enemies
tried
to
use
it
against
him
to
bring
him
into
trouble
but
he
had
become
by
this
time
too
important
a
man
and
nothing
came
of
it
time
went
on
the
bitter
struggle
between
king
and
people
came
to
an
end
the
people
triumphed
and
the
king
laid
his
head
upon
the
block
britain
was
without
ruler
other
than
parliament
it
was
then
one
march
day
in
that
a
few
clad
men
knocked
at
the
door
of
milton
house
we
can
imagine
them
tramping
into
the
poet
study
their
heavy
shoes
resounding
on
the
bare
floor
their
sad
faces
shaded
with
their
tall
black
hats
and
there
in
voices
they
tell
the
astonished
man
that
they
come
from
parliament
to
ask
him
to
be
secretary
for
foreign
tongues
milton
was
astonished
but
he
accepted
the
post
and
now
his
life
became
a
very
busy
one
it
had
been
decided
that
all
letters
to
foreign
powers
should
be
written
in
latin
but
many
governments
wrote
to
england
in
their
own
languages
milton
had
to
translate
these
letters
answer
them
in
latin
and
also
write
little
books
or
pamphlets
in
answer
to
those
which
were
written
against
the
government
it
was
while
he
was
busy
with
this
while
he
was
pouring
out
bitter
abuse
upon
his
enemies
or
upon
the
enemies
of
his
party
that
his
great
misfortune
fell
upon
him
he
became
blind
he
had
had
many
warnings
he
had
been
told
to
be
careful
of
his
eyes
for
the
sight
of
one
had
long
been
gone
but
in
spite
of
all
warnings
he
still
worked
on
and
at
length
became
quite
blind
his
enemies
jeered
at
him
and
said
it
was
a
judgment
upon
him
for
his
wicked
writing
but
never
for
a
moment
did
spirit
quail
he
had
always
been
sure
of
himself
sure
of
his
mission
in
life
sufficient
for
himself
and
now
that
the
horror
of
darkness
shut
him
off
from
others
shut
him
still
more
into
himself
his
heart
did
not
fail
him
blind
at
he
wrote
when
i
consider
how
my
light
is
spent
ere
half
my
days
in
this
dark
world
and
wide
and
that
one
talent
which
is
death
to
hide
lodg
with
me
useless
though
my
soul
more
bent
to
serve
therewith
my
maker
and
present
my
true
account
lest
he
returning
chide
god
exact
day
labour
light
denied
i
fondly
ask
but
patience
to
prevent
that
murmur
soon
replies
doth
not
need
either
man
work
or
his
own
gifts
who
best
bear
his
mild
yoke
they
serve
him
best
his
state
is
kingly
thousands
at
his
bidding
speed
and
post
land
and
ocean
without
rest
they
also
serve
who
only
stand
and
wait
milton
meant
to
take
up
this
new
burden
patiently
but
at
three
with
all
the
vigor
of
life
still
stirring
in
him
he
could
not
meekly
fold
his
hands
to
stand
and
wait
indeed
his
greatest
work
was
still
to
come
blind
though
he
was
he
did
not
give
up
his
post
of
latin
secretary
he
still
remained
chief
secretary
and
others
worked
under
him
among
them
andrew
marvell
the
poet
he
still
gave
all
his
brain
and
learning
to
the
service
of
his
country
while
others
supplied
his
lacking
eyesight
but
now
in
the
same
year
fate
dealt
him
another
blow
his
wife
died
perhaps
there
had
never
been
any
great
love
or
understanding
between
these
two
for
milton
understanding
of
all
women
was
unhappy
but
now
when
he
had
most
need
of
a
woman
kindly
help
and
sympathy
she
went
from
him
leaving
to
his
blind
care
three
motherless
girls
the
eldest
of
whom
was
only
six
years
old
we
know
little
of
milton
home
life
during
the
next
years
but
it
can
not
have
been
a
happy
one
his
children
ran
wild
he
tried
to
teach
them
in
some
sort
he
was
dependent
now
on
others
to
read
to
him
and
he
made
his
daughters
take
their
share
of
this
he
succeeded
in
teaching
them
to
read
in
several
languages
but
they
understood
not
a
word
of
what
they
read
so
it
was
no
wonder
that
they
looked
upon
it
as
a
wearisome
task
they
grew
up
with
neither
love
for
nor
understanding
of
their
stern
blind
father
to
them
he
was
not
the
great
poet
whose
name
should
be
one
of
the
triumphs
of
english
literature
he
was
merely
a
severe
father
and
hard
taskmaster
four
years
after
his
first
wife
died
milton
married
again
this
lady
he
never
saw
but
she
was
gentle
and
kind
and
he
loved
her
for
fifteen
months
she
wrought
peace
and
order
in
his
home
then
she
too
died
leaving
her
husband
more
lonely
than
before
he
mourned
her
loss
in
poetic
words
he
dreamed
she
came
to
him
one
night
came
vested
all
in
white
pure
as
her
mind
her
face
was
veil
yet
to
my
fancied
sight
love
sweetness
goodness
in
her
person
so
clear
as
in
no
face
with
more
delight
but
o
as
to
embrace
me
she
inclin
i
wak
she
fled
and
day
brought
back
my
night
with
this
sonnet
for
those
lines
are
part
of
the
last
sonnet
milton
ever
wrote
it
would
seem
as
if
a
new
period
began
with
milton
his
second
period
of
poetry
writing
who
knows
but
that
it
was
the
sharp
sorrow
of
his
loss
which
sent
him
back
to
poetry
for
throughout
milton
life
we
can
see
that
it
was
always
something
outside
himself
which
made
him
write
poetry
he
did
not
sing
like
the
birds
because
he
must
but
because
he
was
asked
to
sing
by
some
person
or
made
to
sing
by
some
circumstance
however
that
may
be
it
was
now
that
milton
began
his
greatest
work
paradise
lost
twenty
years
before
the
thought
had
come
to
him
that
he
would
write
a
grand
epic
we
have
scarcely
spoken
of
an
epic
since
that
first
of
all
our
epics
the
story
of
beowulf
and
although
others
had
written
epics
milton
is
to
be
remembered
as
the
writer
of
the
great
english
epic
at
first
he
thought
of
taking
arthur
for
his
hero
but
as
more
and
more
he
saw
what
a
mass
of
fable
had
gathered
round
arthur
as
more
and
more
he
saw
how
plain
a
hero
arthur
seemed
stripped
of
that
fable
his
mind
turned
from
the
subject
and
when
at
last
after
twenty
years
of
almost
unbroken
silence
as
a
poet
he
once
more
let
his
organ
voice
be
heard
it
was
not
a
man
he
spoke
of
but
man
he
told
the
story
which
caedmon
a
thousand
years
before
had
told
of
the
war
in
heaven
of
the
temptation
and
fall
of
man
and
of
how
adam
and
eve
were
driven
out
of
the
happy
garden
of
man
first
disobedience
and
the
fruit
of
that
forbidden
tree
whose
mortal
taste
brought
death
into
the
world
and
all
our
woe
with
loss
of
eden
till
one
greater
man
restore
us
and
regain
the
blissful
seat
sing
heavenly
muse
you
will
remember
or
if
you
look
back
to
chapter
xiii
you
can
read
again
about
the
old
poet
caedmon
and
what
he
wrote
it
was
in
that
junius
published
the
caedmon
manuscript
and
milton
who
was
so
great
a
student
no
doubt
heard
of
it
and
found
some
one
to
read
it
to
him
and
perhaps
these
poems
helped
to
decide
him
in
his
choice
although
many
years
before
he
had
thought
of
writing
on
the
subject
perhaps
when
you
are
older
it
may
interest
you
to
read
the
poems
of
milton
and
the
poems
of
caedmon
together
then
you
will
see
how
far
ahead
of
the
old
poet
milton
is
in
smooth
beauty
of
verse
how
far
behind
him
sometimes
in
tender
knowledge
of
man
and
woman
but
i
do
not
think
you
can
hope
to
read
paradise
lost
with
true
pleasure
yet
a
while
it
is
a
long
poem
in
blank
verse
much
of
it
will
seem
dull
to
you
and
you
will
find
it
hard
to
be
interested
in
adam
and
eve
for
milton
set
himself
a
task
of
enormous
difficulty
when
he
tried
to
interest
common
men
and
women
in
people
who
were
without
sin
who
knew
not
good
nor
evil
yet
if
conceit
if
if
the
want
of
the
larger
charity
which
helps
us
to
understand
another
faults
are
sins
then
adam
sinned
long
before
he
left
milton
paradise
in
fact
adam
is
often
a
bore
and
at
times
he
proves
himself
no
gentleman
in
the
highest
and
best
meaning
of
the
word
but
in
spite
of
adam
in
spite
of
everything
that
can
be
said
against
it
paradise
lost
remains
a
splendid
poem
never
perhaps
has
the
english
language
been
used
more
nobly
never
has
blank
verse
taken
on
such
stately
measure
milton
does
not
make
pictures
for
us
like
some
poets
like
spenser
for
instance
he
sings
to
us
he
sings
to
us
not
like
the
gay
minstrel
with
his
lute
but
in
stately
measured
tones
which
remind
us
most
of
solemn
organ
chords
his
voice
comes
to
us
too
out
of
a
country
through
which
if
we
would
find
our
way
we
must
put
our
hand
in
his
and
let
him
guide
us
while
he
sings
and
only
when
we
come
to
love
the
best
words
in
the
best
order
can
we
truly
enjoy
milton
paradise
lost
milton
fails
at
times
to
interest
us
in
adam
but
he
does
interest
us
in
the
bad
angel
satan
and
it
has
been
said
over
and
over
again
that
satan
is
his
true
hero
and
with
such
a
man
as
milton
this
was
hardly
to
be
wondered
at
all
his
life
had
been
a
cry
for
liberty
liberty
even
when
it
bordered
on
rebellion
and
so
he
could
not
fail
to
make
his
arch
rebel
grand
and
even
in
his
last
degradation
we
somehow
pity
him
while
feeling
that
he
is
almost
too
high
for
pity
listen
to
satan
cry
of
sorrow
and
defiance
when
he
finds
himself
cast
out
from
heaven
this
the
region
this
the
soil
the
clime
said
then
the
lost
archangel
the
seat
that
we
must
change
for
heaven
this
mournful
gloom
for
that
celestial
light
be
it
so
since
he
who
now
is
sovran
can
dispose
and
bid
what
shall
be
right
farthest
from
his
is
best
whom
reason
hath
equalled
force
hath
made
supreme
above
his
equals
farewell
happy
fields
where
joy
for
ever
dwells
hail
horrors
hail
infernal
world
and
thou
profoundest
hell
receive
thy
new
possessor
one
who
brings
a
mind
not
to
be
changed
by
place
or
time
the
mind
is
its
own
place
and
in
itself
can
make
a
heaven
of
hell
a
hell
of
heaven
what
matter
where
if
i
be
still
the
same
and
what
i
should
be
all
but
less
than
he
whom
thunder
hath
made
greater
here
at
least
we
shall
be
free
the
almighty
hath
not
built
here
for
his
envy
will
not
drive
us
hence
here
we
may
reign
secure
and
in
my
choice
to
reign
is
worth
ambition
though
in
hell
better
to
reign
in
hell
than
serve
in
heaven
then
in
contrast
to
this
outburst
of
regal
defiance
read
the
last
beautiful
lines
of
the
poem
and
see
in
what
softened
mood
of
submission
milton
pictures
our
first
parents
as
they
leave
the
happy
garden
in
either
hand
the
hastening
angel
caught
our
lingering
parents
and
to
the
eastern
gate
led
them
direct
and
down
the
cliff
as
fast
to
the
subjected
plain
then
disappeared
they
looking
back
all
the
eastern
side
beheld
of
paradise
so
late
their
happy
seat
waved
over
by
that
flaming
brand
the
gate
with
dreadful
faces
thronged
and
fiery
arms
some
natural
tears
they
dropped
but
wiped
them
soon
the
world
was
all
before
them
where
to
choose
their
place
of
rest
and
providence
their
guide
they
hand
in
hand
with
wandering
steps
and
slow
through
eden
took
their
solitary
way
milton
worked
slowly
at
this
grand
poem
being
blind
he
had
now
to
depend
on
others
to
write
out
what
poetry
he
made
in
his
own
mind
so
it
was
written
in
a
parcel
of
ten
twenty
or
thirty
verses
at
a
time
by
whatever
hand
came
next
we
are
told
that
when
he
was
dictating
sometimes
he
sat
leaning
back
sideways
in
an
with
his
leg
flung
over
the
arm
sometimes
he
dictated
from
his
bed
and
if
in
the
middle
of
the
night
lines
came
to
him
whatever
time
it
was
he
would
ring
for
one
of
his
daughters
to
write
them
down
for
him
lest
the
thought
should
be
lost
ere
morning
we
are
told
too
that
he
wrote
very
little
in
summer
for
he
said
himself
that
it
was
in
winter
and
spring
that
his
poetic
fancy
seemed
to
come
best
to
him
and
that
what
he
wrote
at
other
times
did
not
please
him
so
that
in
all
the
years
he
was
about
this
poem
he
may
be
said
to
have
spent
but
half
his
time
therein
but
now
while
milton
mind
was
full
of
splendid
images
while
in
spite
of
the
discomfort
and
lonliness
of
his
misruled
home
he
was
adding
line
to
line
of
splendid
sounding
english
great
changes
came
over
the
land
oliver
cromwell
died
to
him
succeeded
his
son
richard
but
his
weak
hands
could
not
hold
the
scepter
he
could
not
bind
together
a
rebel
people
as
great
oliver
had
done
in
a
few
months
he
gave
up
the
task
and
little
more
than
a
year
later
the
people
who
had
wept
at
the
death
of
the
great
protector
were
madly
rejoicing
at
the
return
of
a
despot
with
a
stuart
king
upon
the
throne
there
was
no
safety
for
the
rebel
poet
who
had
used
all
the
power
of
his
wit
and
learning
against
the
royal
cause
pity
for
his
blindness
might
not
save
him
so
listening
to
the
warnings
of
his
friends
he
fled
into
hiding
somewhere
in
the
city
of
london
a
place
of
retirement
and
abscondence
but
after
a
time
the
danger
passed
and
milton
crept
forth
from
his
it
was
perhaps
pity
for
his
blind
helplessness
perhaps
contempt
for
his
powerlessness
that
saved
him
who
can
tell
his
books
were
burned
by
the
common
hangman
and
he
found
himself
in
prison
for
a
short
time
but
he
was
soon
released
while
others
were
dying
for
their
cause
the
blind
poet
whose
trumpet
call
had
been
liberty
liberty
was
contemptuously
allowed
to
live
now
indeed
had
milton
fallen
on
dark
and
evil
days
he
had
escaped
with
his
life
and
was
free
but
all
that
he
had
worked
for
during
the
past
twenty
years
he
saw
shattered
as
at
one
blow
he
saw
his
friends
suffering
imprisonment
and
death
himself
forsaken
and
beggared
he
found
no
sympathy
at
home
his
daughters
who
had
not
loved
their
father
in
his
days
of
wealth
and
ease
loved
him
still
less
in
poverty
they
sold
his
books
cheated
him
with
the
housekeeping
money
and
in
every
way
added
to
his
unhappiness
at
length
as
a
way
out
of
the
misery
and
confusion
of
his
home
milton
married
for
the
third
time
the
new
wife
was
a
placid
kindly
woman
she
managed
the
house
managed
too
the
wild
unruly
girls
as
no
one
had
managed
them
before
she
saw
the
folly
of
keeping
them
wholly
untamed
and
as
they
were
at
home
and
persuaded
her
husband
to
let
them
learn
something
by
which
they
might
earn
a
living
so
they
went
out
into
the
world
to
learn
some
curious
and
ingenious
sorts
of
manufacture
that
are
proper
for
women
to
learn
particularly
embroideries
in
gold
and
silver
thus
for
the
last
few
years
of
his
life
milton
was
surrounded
by
peace
and
content
such
as
he
had
never
before
known
all
through
life
he
had
never
had
any
one
to
love
him
deeply
except
his
father
and
his
mother
whose
love
for
him
was
perhaps
not
all
wise
those
who
had
loved
him
in
part
had
feared
him
too
and
the
fear
outdid
the
love
but
now
in
the
evening
of
his
days
if
no
perfect
love
came
to
him
he
found
at
least
kindly
understanding
his
wife
admired
him
and
cared
for
him
she
had
a
fair
face
and
pretty
voice
and
it
is
pleasant
to
picture
the
poet
sitting
at
his
organ
playing
while
his
wife
sings
he
can
not
see
the
sun
gleam
and
play
in
her
golden
hair
or
the
quick
color
come
and
go
in
her
fair
face
but
at
least
he
can
take
joy
in
the
sound
of
her
sweet
fresh
voice
it
was
soon
after
this
third
marriage
that
paradise
lost
was
finished
and
published
and
even
in
those
wild
restoration
days
when
laughter
and
pleasure
alone
were
sought
men
acknowledged
the
beauty
and
grandeur
of
this
grave
poem
this
man
cuts
us
all
out
and
the
ancients
too
said
dryden
another
and
younger
poet
people
now
came
to
visit
the
author
of
paradise
lost
as
before
they
had
come
to
visit
great
cromwell
secretary
we
have
a
pleasant
picture
of
him
sitting
in
his
garden
at
the
door
of
his
house
on
sunny
days
to
enjoy
the
fresh
air
for
of
the
many
houses
in
which
milton
lived
not
one
was
without
a
garden
there
even
when
the
sun
did
not
shine
wrapt
in
a
great
coat
of
coarse
gray
cloth
he
received
his
visitors
or
when
the
weather
was
colder
he
sat
in
an
upstairs
room
hung
with
rusty
green
he
wore
no
sword
as
it
was
the
fashion
in
those
days
to
do
and
his
clothes
were
black
his
long
light
gray
hair
fell
in
waves
round
his
pale
but
not
colorless
face
and
the
sad
gray
eyes
with
which
he
seemed
to
look
upon
his
visitors
were
still
clear
and
beautiful
life
had
now
come
for
milton
to
a
peaceful
evening
time
but
his
work
was
not
yet
finished
he
had
two
great
poems
still
to
write
one
was
paradise
regained
in
this
he
shows
how
man
lost
happiness
was
found
again
in
christ
here
is
a
second
temptation
the
temptation
in
the
wilderness
but
this
time
satan
is
defeated
christ
is
victorious
the
second
poem
was
samson
agonistes
which
tells
the
tragic
story
of
samson
in
his
blindness
and
no
one
reading
it
can
fail
to
see
that
it
is
the
story
too
of
milton
in
his
blindness
it
is
milton
himself
who
speaks
when
he
makes
samson
exclaim
o
loss
of
sight
of
thee
i
most
complain
blind
among
enemies
o
worse
than
chains
dungeon
or
beggary
or
decrepit
age
light
the
prime
work
of
god
to
me
is
extinct
and
all
her
various
objects
of
delight
annulled
which
might
in
part
my
grief
have
eased
inferior
to
the
vilest
now
become
of
man
or
worm
the
vilest
here
excel
me
they
creep
yet
see
i
dark
in
light
exposed
to
daily
fraud
contempt
abuse
and
wrong
within
doors
or
without
still
as
a
fool
in
power
of
others
never
in
my
own
o
dark
dark
dark
amid
the
blaze
of
noon
irrecoverably
dark
total
eclipse
without
all
hope
of
day
this
was
milton
last
poem
he
lived
still
four
years
longer
and
still
wrote
but
his
singing
days
were
over
and
what
he
now
wrote
was
in
prose
his
life
work
was
done
and
one
dark
november
evening
in
he
peacefully
died
thy
soul
was
like
a
star
and
dwelt
apart
thou
hadst
a
voice
whose
sound
was
like
the
sea
pure
as
the
naked
heavens
majestic
free
so
didst
thou
travel
on
life
common
way
chapter
lix
bunyan
the
pilgrim
progress
the
second
great
puritan
writer
of
england
was
john
bunyan
he
was
born
in
more
than
twenty
years
after
milton
his
father
was
a
tinker
a
tinker
the
word
makes
us
think
of
ragged
men
and
women
who
wander
about
the
countryside
they
carry
bundles
of
old
umbrellas
and
sometimes
a
battered
kettle
or
two
they
live
who
knows
how
they
sleep
who
knows
where
sometimes
in
our
walks
we
come
across
a
charred
round
patch
upon
the
grass
in
some
quiet
nook
by
the
roadside
and
we
know
the
tinkers
have
been
there
and
can
imagine
all
sorts
of
stories
about
them
or
sometimes
better
still
we
find
them
really
there
by
the
roadside
boiling
a
mysterious
legged
black
kettle
over
a
fire
of
sticks
but
john
bunyan
father
was
not
this
kind
of
tinker
he
did
not
wander
about
the
countryside
but
lived
at
the
little
village
of
elstow
about
a
mile
from
the
town
of
bedford
as
his
father
had
before
him
he
was
a
poor
and
honest
workman
who
mended
his
neighbors
kettles
and
pans
and
did
his
best
to
keep
his
family
in
decent
comfort
one
thing
which
shows
this
is
that
little
john
was
sent
to
school
in
those
days
learning
even
learning
to
read
and
write
was
not
the
just
due
of
every
one
it
was
only
for
the
do
but
yet
says
bunyan
himself
notwithstanding
the
meanness
and
inconsiderableness
of
my
parents
it
pleased
god
to
put
it
into
their
hearts
to
put
me
to
school
to
learn
me
both
to
read
and
write
bunyan
was
born
when
the
struggle
between
king
and
people
was
beginning
to
be
felt
and
was
a
great
boy
of
fourteen
when
at
last
the
armies
of
king
and
parliament
met
on
the
battlefield
of
edgehill
to
many
this
struggle
was
a
struggle
for
freedom
in
religion
from
end
to
end
of
our
island
the
question
of
religion
was
the
burning
question
of
the
day
religion
had
wrought
itself
into
the
lives
of
people
in
those
days
of
few
books
the
bible
was
the
one
book
which
might
be
found
in
almost
every
house
the
people
carried
it
in
their
hands
and
its
words
were
ever
on
their
lips
but
the
religion
which
came
to
be
the
religion
of
more
than
half
the
people
of
england
was
a
stern
one
they
forgot
the
testament
of
love
they
remembered
only
the
testament
of
wrath
they
made
the
narrow
way
narrower
and
they
believed
that
any
who
strayed
from
it
would
be
punished
terribly
and
eternally
it
was
into
this
stern
world
that
little
john
bunyan
was
born
and
just
as
a
stern
religious
struggle
was
going
on
in
england
so
a
stern
religious
struggle
went
on
within
his
little
heart
he
heard
people
round
him
talk
of
sins
and
death
of
a
dreadful
day
of
judgment
of
wrath
to
come
these
things
laid
hold
of
his
childish
mind
and
he
began
to
believe
that
in
the
sight
of
god
he
must
be
a
desperate
sinner
dreadful
dreams
came
to
him
at
night
he
dreamed
that
the
evil
one
was
trying
to
carry
him
off
to
a
darksome
place
there
to
be
bound
down
with
the
chains
and
bonds
of
darkness
unto
the
judgment
of
the
great
day
such
dreams
made
night
terrible
to
him
bunyan
tells
us
that
he
swore
and
told
lies
and
that
he
was
the
ringleader
in
all
the
wickedness
of
the
village
but
perhaps
he
was
not
so
bad
as
he
would
have
us
believe
for
he
was
always
very
severe
in
his
judgments
of
himself
perhaps
he
was
not
worse
than
many
other
boys
who
did
not
feel
that
they
had
sinned
beyond
all
forgiveness
and
in
spite
of
his
awful
thoughts
and
terrifying
dreams
bunyan
still
went
on
being
a
naughty
boy
he
still
told
lies
and
swore
at
length
he
left
school
and
became
a
tinker
like
his
father
but
all
england
was
being
drawn
into
war
and
so
bunyan
when
about
seventeen
became
a
soldier
strange
to
say
we
do
not
know
upon
which
side
he
fought
some
people
think
that
because
his
father
belonged
to
the
church
of
england
that
he
must
have
fought
on
the
king
side
but
that
is
nothing
to
go
by
for
many
people
belonged
to
that
church
for
old
custom
sake
who
had
no
opinions
one
way
or
another
and
who
took
no
side
until
forced
by
the
war
to
do
so
it
seems
much
more
likely
that
bunyan
so
puritan
in
all
his
ways
of
thought
should
fight
for
the
puritan
side
but
we
do
not
know
he
was
not
long
a
soldier
we
do
not
know
quite
how
long
it
was
perhaps
only
a
few
months
but
during
these
few
months
his
life
was
saved
by
what
seemed
to
him
afterwards
to
have
been
a
miracle
when
i
was
a
soldier
he
says
i
with
others
were
drawn
out
to
go
to
such
a
place
to
besiege
it
but
when
i
was
just
ready
to
go
one
of
the
company
desired
to
go
in
my
room
to
which
when
i
had
consented
he
took
my
place
and
coming
to
the
siege
as
he
stood
sentinel
he
was
shot
in
the
head
with
a
musket
bullet
and
died
here
as
i
said
were
judgments
and
mercy
but
neither
of
them
did
awaken
my
soul
to
righteousness
wherefore
i
sinned
still
and
grew
more
and
more
rebellious
against
god
so
whether
bunyan
served
in
the
royal
army
where
he
might
have
heard
oaths
or
in
the
parliamentarian
where
he
might
have
heard
godly
songs
and
prayers
he
still
went
on
his
way
as
before
some
time
after
bunyan
left
the
army
and
while
he
was
still
very
young
he
married
both
he
and
his
wife
were
he
says
as
poor
as
poor
might
be
not
having
so
much
household
stuff
as
a
dish
or
a
spoon
betwixt
us
both
yet
this
she
had
for
her
part
the
plain
man
pathway
to
heaven
and
the
practice
of
piety
which
her
father
had
left
her
when
he
died
these
two
books
bunyan
read
with
his
wife
picking
up
again
the
art
of
reading
which
he
had
been
taught
at
school
and
which
he
had
since
almost
forgotten
he
began
now
to
go
a
great
deal
to
church
and
one
of
his
chief
pleasures
was
helping
to
ring
the
bells
to
him
the
services
were
a
joy
he
loved
the
singing
the
altar
with
its
candles
the
rich
robes
the
white
surplices
and
everything
that
made
the
service
beautiful
yet
the
terrible
struggle
between
good
and
evil
in
his
soul
went
on
he
seemed
to
hear
voices
in
the
air
good
voices
and
bad
voices
voices
that
accused
him
voices
that
tempted
he
was
a
most
miserable
man
and
seemed
to
himself
to
be
one
of
the
most
wicked
and
yet
perhaps
the
worst
thing
he
could
accuse
himself
of
doing
was
playing
games
on
sunday
and
pleasing
himself
by
he
gave
up
his
because
it
was
a
temptation
to
vanity
yet
my
mind
hankered
therefore
i
would
go
to
the
steeple
house
and
look
on
though
i
durst
not
ring
one
by
one
he
gave
up
all
the
things
he
loved
things
that
even
if
we
think
them
wrong
do
not
seem
to
us
to
merit
everlasting
punishment
but
at
last
the
long
struggle
ended
and
his
tortured
mind
found
rest
in
the
love
of
christ
bunyan
himself
tells
us
the
story
of
this
long
fight
in
a
book
called
grace
abounding
to
the
chief
of
sinners
as
we
read
we
can
not
help
but
see
that
bunyan
was
never
a
very
wicked
man
but
merely
a
man
with
a
very
tender
conscience
things
which
seemed
to
other
men
trifles
were
to
him
deadly
sins
and
although
he
was
so
stern
to
himself
to
others
he
shows
a
fatherly
tenderness
which
makes
us
feel
that
this
rough
tinker
was
no
narrow
puritan
but
a
christian
and
now
that
bunyan
had
found
peace
he
became
a
baptist
and
joined
the
church
of
a
man
whom
he
calls
the
holy
mr
gifford
gifford
had
been
an
officer
in
the
royal
army
he
had
been
wild
and
drunken
but
repenting
of
his
evil
ways
had
become
a
preacher
now
until
he
died
some
years
later
he
was
bunyan
fast
friend
in
the
same
year
as
bunyan
lost
his
friend
his
wife
too
died
and
he
was
left
alone
with
four
children
two
of
them
little
girls
one
of
whom
was
blind
she
was
because
of
that
all
the
more
dear
to
him
she
lay
nearer
to
my
heart
than
all
beside
he
says
and
now
bunyan
friends
found
out
his
great
gift
of
speech
they
begged
him
to
preach
but
he
was
so
humble
and
modest
that
at
first
he
refused
at
length
however
he
was
he
began
his
career
as
a
minister
and
soon
became
famous
people
came
from
long
distances
to
hear
him
and
he
preached
not
only
in
elstow
and
bedford
but
in
all
the
country
round
he
preached
not
only
in
churches
but
in
barns
and
in
fields
by
the
roadside
or
in
the
anywhere
in
fact
where
he
could
gather
an
audience
it
was
while
cromwell
ruled
that
bunyan
began
this
ministry
but
in
spite
of
all
the
battles
that
had
been
fought
for
religious
freedom
there
was
as
yet
no
real
religious
freedom
in
england
each
part
as
it
became
powerful
tried
to
tyrannize
over
every
other
party
and
no
one
was
allowed
to
preach
without
a
license
the
presbyterians
were
now
in
power
bunyan
was
a
baptist
and
some
of
the
presbyterians
would
gladly
have
silenced
him
yet
during
cromwell
lifetime
he
went
his
way
in
peace
then
the
restoration
came
a
few
months
later
bunyan
was
arrested
for
preaching
without
a
license
those
who
now
ruled
were
angry
with
the
tinker
because
he
strove
to
mend
souls
as
well
as
kettles
and
pans
before
he
was
taken
prisoner
bunyan
was
warned
of
his
danger
and
if
he
had
been
minded
to
have
played
the
coward
he
might
have
escaped
but
he
would
not
try
to
save
himself
if
i
should
now
run
to
make
an
escape
he
said
it
will
be
a
very
ill
savour
in
the
country
for
what
will
my
weak
and
brethren
think
of
it
but
that
i
was
not
so
strong
in
deed
as
i
was
in
word
deane
so
bunyan
was
taken
prisoner
even
then
he
might
have
been
at
once
set
free
would
he
have
promised
not
to
preach
but
to
all
persuasions
he
replied
i
durst
not
leave
off
that
work
which
god
has
called
me
to
thus
bunyan
long
imprisonment
of
twelve
years
began
he
had
married
again
by
this
time
and
the
parting
with
his
wife
and
children
was
hard
for
him
and
harder
still
for
the
young
wife
left
behind
all
smayed
at
the
news
but
although
she
was
dismayed
she
was
brave
of
heart
and
she
at
once
set
about
eagerly
doing
all
she
could
to
free
her
husband
she
went
to
london
she
ventured
into
the
house
of
lords
and
there
pleaded
for
him
touched
by
her
earnestness
and
her
helplessness
the
lords
treated
her
kindly
but
they
told
her
they
could
do
nothing
for
her
and
that
she
must
plead
her
case
before
the
ordinary
judges
so
back
to
bedford
she
went
and
with
beating
heart
and
trembling
limbs
sought
out
the
judges
again
she
was
kindly
received
but
again
her
petition
was
of
no
avail
the
law
was
the
law
bunyan
had
broken
the
law
and
must
suffer
he
would
not
promise
to
cease
from
preaching
she
would
as
little
promise
for
him
my
lord
she
said
he
dares
not
leave
off
preaching
as
long
as
he
can
speak
so
it
was
all
useless
labor
neither
side
could
or
would
give
way
one
inch
bursting
into
tears
the
poor
young
wife
turned
away
but
she
wept
not
so
much
because
they
were
so
against
me
and
my
husband
but
to
think
what
a
sad
account
such
poor
creatures
will
have
to
give
at
the
coming
of
the
lord
when
they
shall
then
answer
for
all
things
whatsoever
they
have
done
in
the
body
whether
it
be
good
or
whether
it
be
bad
seeing
there
was
no
help
for
it
bunyan
set
himself
bravely
to
endure
his
imprisonment
and
in
truth
this
was
not
very
severe
strangely
enough
he
was
allowed
to
preach
to
his
prisoners
he
was
even
at
one
time
allowed
to
go
to
church
but
the
great
thing
for
us
is
that
he
wrote
books
already
before
his
imprisonment
he
had
written
several
books
and
now
he
wrote
that
for
which
he
is
most
famous
the
pilgrim
progress
it
is
a
book
so
well
known
and
so
well
loved
that
i
think
i
need
say
little
about
it
in
the
form
of
a
dream
bunyan
tells
as
you
know
the
story
of
christian
who
set
out
on
his
long
and
difficult
pilgrimage
from
the
city
of
destruction
to
the
city
of
the
blest
he
tells
of
all
christian
trials
and
adventures
on
the
way
of
how
he
encounters
giants
and
lion
of
how
he
fights
with
a
great
demon
and
of
how
at
length
he
arrives
at
his
journey
end
in
safety
a
great
writer
has
said
there
is
no
book
in
our
literature
on
which
we
would
so
readily
stake
the
fame
of
the
old
unpolluted
english
language
no
book
which
shows
so
well
how
rich
that
language
is
in
its
own
proper
wealth
and
how
little
it
has
been
improved
by
all
that
it
has
borrowed
for
the
power
of
imagination
this
writer
places
bunyan
by
the
side
of
milton
although
there
were
many
clever
men
in
england
towards
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
there
were
only
two
minds
which
had
great
powers
of
imagination
one
of
those
minds
produced
the
paradise
lost
the
other
the
pilgrim
progress
that
is
very
great
praise
and
yet
although
milton
and
bunyan
are
thus
placed
side
by
side
no
two
writers
are
more
widely
apart
milton
writing
is
full
of
the
proofs
of
his
leaning
his
english
is
fine
and
stately
but
it
is
full
of
words
made
from
latin
words
as
an
early
writer
on
him
said
milton
language
is
english
but
it
is
milton
english
on
the
other
hand
bunyan
writing
is
most
simple
he
uses
strong
plain
purely
english
words
there
is
hardly
one
word
in
all
his
writing
which
a
man
who
knows
his
bible
can
not
easily
understand
and
it
was
from
the
bible
that
bunyan
gathered
nearly
all
his
learning
he
knew
it
from
end
to
end
and
the
poetry
and
grandeur
of
its
language
filled
his
soul
but
he
read
other
books
too
among
them
we
feel
sure
the
faery
queen
some
day
you
may
like
to
compare
the
adventures
of
the
red
cross
knight
with
the
adventures
of
christian
and
perhaps
in
all
the
faery
queen
you
will
find
nothing
so
real
and
exciting
as
christian
fight
with
apollyon
apollyon
comes
from
a
greek
word
meaning
the
destroyer
this
is
how
bunyan
tells
of
the
fight
but
now
in
this
valley
of
humiliation
poor
christian
was
hard
put
to
it
for
he
had
gone
but
a
little
way
before
he
espied
a
foul
fiend
coming
over
the
field
to
meet
him
his
name
is
apollyon
then
did
christian
begin
to
be
afraid
and
to
cast
in
his
mind
whether
to
go
back
or
to
stand
his
ground
but
he
considered
again
that
he
had
no
armour
for
his
back
and
therefore
thought
that
to
turn
the
back
to
him
might
give
him
greater
advantage
with
ease
to
pierce
him
with
his
darts
therefore
he
resolved
to
venture
and
stand
his
ground
for
he
thought
had
i
no
more
in
mine
eye
than
the
saving
of
my
life
be
the
best
way
to
stand
so
he
went
on
and
apollyon
met
him
now
the
monster
was
hideous
to
behold
he
was
clothed
with
scales
like
a
fish
and
they
are
his
pride
he
had
wings
like
a
dragon
feet
like
a
bear
and
out
of
his
belly
came
fire
and
smoke
and
his
mouth
was
as
the
mouth
of
a
lion
when
he
came
up
to
christian
he
beheld
him
with
a
disdainful
countenance
and
thus
began
to
question
him
apollyon
when
came
you
and
whither
are
you
bound
christian
i
am
come
from
the
city
of
destruction
which
is
the
place
of
all
evil
and
am
going
to
the
city
of
zion
after
this
apollyon
argued
with
christian
trying
to
persuade
him
to
give
up
his
pilgrimage
and
return
to
his
evil
ways
but
christian
would
listen
to
nothing
that
apollyon
could
say
then
apollyon
straddled
quite
over
the
whole
breadth
of
the
way
and
said
am
void
of
fear
in
this
matter
prepare
thyself
to
die
for
i
swear
by
my
infernal
den
that
thou
shalt
go
no
further
here
will
i
spill
thy
soul
and
with
that
he
threw
a
flaming
dart
at
his
heart
but
christian
had
a
shield
in
his
hand
with
which
he
caught
it
and
so
prevented
the
danger
of
that
then
did
christian
draw
for
he
saw
it
was
time
to
bestir
him
and
apollyon
as
fast
made
at
him
throwing
darts
as
thick
as
hail
by
the
which
notwithstanding
all
that
christian
could
do
to
avoid
it
apollyon
wounded
him
in
his
head
his
hand
and
foot
this
made
christian
give
a
little
back
apollyon
therefore
followed
his
work
amain
and
christian
again
took
courage
and
resisted
as
manfully
as
he
could
this
sore
combat
lasted
for
above
half
a
day
even
till
christian
was
almost
quite
spent
for
you
must
know
that
christian
by
reason
of
his
wounds
must
needs
grow
weaker
and
weaker
then
apollyon
espying
his
opportunity
began
to
gather
up
close
to
christian
and
wrestling
with
him
gave
him
a
dreadful
fall
and
with
that
christian
sword
flew
out
of
his
hand
then
said
apollyon
am
sure
of
thee
now
and
with
that
he
had
almost
pressed
him
to
death
so
that
christian
began
to
despair
of
life
but
as
god
would
have
it
while
apollyon
was
fetching
his
last
blow
thereby
to
make
a
full
end
of
this
good
man
christian
nimbly
reached
out
his
hand
for
his
sword
and
caught
it
saying
not
against
me
o
mine
enemy
when
i
fall
i
shall
arise
and
with
that
gave
him
a
deadly
thrust
which
made
him
give
back
as
one
that
had
received
his
mortal
wound
christian
perceiving
that
made
at
him
again
saying
in
all
these
things
we
are
more
than
conquerors
through
him
that
loved
us
and
with
that
apollyon
spread
forth
his
dragon
wings
and
sped
him
away
and
christian
saw
him
no
more
bunyan
wrote
a
second
part
or
sequel
to
the
pilgrim
progress
in
which
he
tells
of
the
adventures
of
christian
wife
and
children
on
their
way
to
zion
but
the
story
does
not
interest
us
as
the
story
of
christian
does
because
we
love
christian
we
are
glad
to
know
that
his
wife
and
children
escaped
destruction
but
except
that
they
belong
to
him
we
do
not
really
care
about
them
bunyan
wrote
several
other
books
the
best
known
are
the
holy
war
and
grace
abounding
the
holy
war
might
be
called
a
paradise
lost
and
regained
in
homely
prose
it
tells
much
the
same
story
the
story
of
the
struggle
between
good
and
evil
for
the
possession
of
man
soul
in
grace
abounding
bunyan
tells
of
his
own
struggle
with
evil
and
it
is
from
that
book
that
we
learn
much
of
what
we
know
of
his
life
he
also
wrote
the
life
and
death
of
badman
instead
of
telling
how
a
good
man
struggles
with
evil
and
at
last
wins
rest
it
tells
of
how
a
bad
man
yields
always
to
evil
and
comes
at
last
to
a
sad
end
it
is
not
a
pretty
story
and
is
one
i
think
which
you
will
not
care
to
read
bunyan
too
wrote
a
good
deal
of
rime
but
for
the
most
part
it
can
hardly
be
called
poetry
it
is
for
his
prose
that
we
remember
him
yet
who
would
willingly
part
with
the
song
of
the
in
the
second
part
of
the
pilgrim
progress
he
that
is
down
needs
fear
no
fall
he
that
is
low
no
pride
he
that
is
humble
ever
shall
have
god
to
be
his
guide
i
am
content
with
what
i
have
little
be
it
or
much
and
lord
contentment
still
i
crave
because
thou
savest
such
fullness
to
such
a
burden
is
that
go
on
pilgrimage
here
little
and
hereafter
bliss
is
best
from
age
to
age
when
bunyan
had
been
in
prison
for
six
years
he
was
set
free
but
as
he
at
once
began
to
preach
he
was
immediately
seized
and
reimprisoned
he
remained
shut
up
for
six
years
longer
then
king
charles
ii
passed
an
act
called
the
declaration
of
indulgence
by
this
act
all
the
severe
laws
against
those
who
did
not
conform
to
the
church
of
england
were
done
away
with
and
in
consequence
bunyan
was
set
free
charles
passed
this
act
not
because
he
was
sorry
for
the
nonconformists
as
all
who
would
not
conform
to
the
church
of
england
were
called
but
because
he
wished
to
free
the
roman
catholics
and
he
could
not
do
that
without
freeing
the
nonconformists
too
two
years
later
bunyan
was
again
imprisoned
because
in
contempt
of
his
good
laws
he
preached
or
teached
in
other
manner
than
according
to
the
liturgy
or
practice
of
the
church
of
england
but
this
time
his
imprisonment
lasted
only
six
months
and
i
must
tell
you
that
many
people
now
think
that
it
was
during
this
later
short
imprisonment
that
bunyan
wrote
the
pilgrim
progress
and
not
during
the
earlier
and
longer
the
rest
of
bunyan
life
passed
peacefully
and
happily
but
we
know
few
details
of
it
for
he
seems
to
have
been
too
busy
to
keep
any
records
of
his
busy
life
we
know
at
least
that
it
was
busy
he
was
now
a
licensed
preacher
and
if
the
people
had
flocked
to
hear
him
before
his
imprisonment
they
flocked
in
far
greater
numbers
now
even
learned
men
came
to
hear
him
i
marvel
said
king
charles
to
one
that
a
learned
man
such
as
you
can
sit
and
listen
to
an
unlearned
tinker
may
it
please
your
majesty
replied
he
i
would
gladly
give
up
all
my
learning
if
i
could
preach
like
that
tinker
bunyan
became
the
head
of
the
baptist
church
near
and
far
he
traveled
preaching
and
teaching
honored
and
beloved
wherever
he
went
and
his
word
had
such
power
his
commands
had
such
weight
that
people
playfully
called
him
bishop
bunyan
yet
he
was
not
puffed
up
in
prosperity
nor
shaken
in
adversity
always
holding
the
golden
mean
doe
death
found
bunyan
still
busy
still
kindly
a
young
man
who
lived
at
reading
had
offended
his
father
so
greatly
that
the
father
cast
him
off
in
his
trouble
the
young
man
came
to
bunyan
he
at
once
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
off
to
reading
there
he
saw
the
angry
father
and
persuaded
him
to
make
peace
with
his
repentant
son
glad
at
his
success
bunyan
rode
on
to
london
where
he
meant
to
preach
but
the
weather
was
bad
the
roads
were
heavy
with
mud
he
was
overtaken
by
a
storm
of
rain
and
ere
he
could
find
shelter
he
was
soaked
to
the
skin
he
arrived
at
length
at
a
friend
house
wet
and
weary
and
shaking
with
fever
he
went
to
bed
never
to
rise
again
the
time
had
come
when
like
christian
he
must
cross
the
river
which
all
must
cross
where
there
is
no
bridge
to
go
over
and
the
river
very
deep
but
bunyan
like
christian
was
held
up
by
hope
he
well
knew
the
words
when
thou
passest
through
the
waters
i
will
be
with
thee
and
through
the
rivers
they
shall
not
overflow
thee
and
so
he
crossed
over
and
may
we
not
believe
that
bunyan
when
he
reached
the
other
side
heard
again
as
he
had
once
before
heard
in
his
immortal
dream
all
the
bells
in
the
city
ring
again
with
joy
and
that
it
was
said
unto
him
enter
ye
into
the
joy
of
our
lord
year
chapter
lx
dryden
the
new
poetry
the
life
of
dryden
may
be
said
to
comprehend
a
history
of
the
literature
of
england
and
its
changes
during
nearly
half
a
century
with
these
words
sir
walter
scott
himself
a
great
writer
began
his
life
of
john
dryden
yet
although
dryden
stands
for
so
much
in
the
story
of
our
literature
as
a
man
we
know
little
of
him
as
a
writer
his
influence
on
the
age
in
which
he
lived
was
tremendous
as
a
man
he
is
more
shadowy
than
almost
any
other
greater
writer
we
seem
to
know
chaucer
and
spenser
and
milton
and
even
shakespeare
a
little
but
to
know
dryden
in
himself
seems
impossible
we
can
only
know
him
through
his
works
and
through
his
age
and
in
him
we
find
the
expression
of
his
age
with
milton
ended
the
great
romantic
school
of
poetry
he
was
indeed
as
one
born
out
of
time
a
lonely
giant
he
died
and
left
no
follower
with
dryden
began
a
new
school
of
poetry
which
was
to
be
the
type
of
english
poetry
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
to
come
this
is
called
the
classical
school
and
the
rime
which
the
classical
poets
used
is
called
the
heroic
couplet
it
is
a
long
line
and
rimes
in
couplets
as
for
instance
he
sought
the
storms
but
for
a
calm
unfit
would
stem
too
nigh
the
sands
to
boast
his
wit
great
wits
are
sure
to
madness
near
allied
and
thin
partitions
do
their
bounds
divide
and
achitophel
dryden
did
not
invent
the
heroic
couplet
but
it
was
he
who
first
made
it
famous
it
was
he
says
scott
who
first
showed
that
the
english
language
was
capable
of
uniting
smoothness
and
strength
but
when
you
come
to
read
dryden
poems
you
may
perhaps
feel
that
in
gaining
the
smoothness
of
art
they
have
lost
something
of
the
beauty
of
nature
the
perfect
lines
with
their
regular
sounding
rimes
almost
weary
us
at
length
and
we
are
glad
to
turn
to
the
rougher
beauty
of
some
earlier
poet
but
before
speaking
more
of
what
dryden
did
let
me
tell
you
a
little
of
what
we
know
of
his
life
john
dryden
was
the
son
of
a
northamptonshire
gentleman
who
had
a
small
estate
and
a
large
family
for
john
was
the
eldest
of
fourteen
children
the
family
was
a
puritan
one
although
in
when
john
was
born
the
civil
war
had
not
yet
begun
when
john
dryden
left
school
he
went
like
nearly
all
the
poets
to
cambridge
of
what
he
did
at
college
we
know
very
little
he
may
have
been
wild
for
more
than
once
he
got
into
trouble
and
once
he
was
rebuked
on
the
head
for
speaking
scornfully
of
some
nobleman
he
was
seven
years
at
cambridge
but
he
looked
back
on
these
years
with
no
joy
he
had
no
love
for
his
university
and
even
wrote
oxford
to
him
a
dearer
name
shall
be
than
his
own
mother
university
already
at
college
dryden
had
begun
to
write
poetry
but
his
poem
on
the
death
of
cromwell
is
perhaps
the
first
that
is
worth
remembering
swift
and
relentless
through
the
land
he
past
like
that
bold
greek
who
did
the
east
subdue
and
made
to
battles
of
such
heroic
haste
as
if
on
wings
of
victory
he
flew
he
fought
secure
of
fortune
as
of
fame
till
by
new
maps
the
island
might
be
shown
of
conquests
which
he
strewed
he
came
this
as
the
galaxy
with
stars
is
sown
nor
was
he
like
those
stars
which
only
shine
when
to
pale
mariners
they
storms
portend
he
had
a
calmer
influence
and
his
mien
did
love
and
majesty
together
blend
nor
died
he
when
his
ebbing
fame
went
less
but
when
fresh
laurels
courted
him
to
live
he
seemed
but
to
prevent
some
new
success
as
if
above
what
triumphs
earth
could
give
his
ashes
in
a
peaceful
urn
shall
rest
his
name
a
great
example
stands
to
show
how
strangely
high
endeavours
may
be
blessed
where
piety
and
valour
jointly
go
so
wrote
dryden
but
after
the
death
of
cromwell
came
the
restoration
dryden
had
been
able
to
admire
cromwell
but
although
he
came
of
a
puritan
family
he
could
never
have
been
a
puritan
at
heart
what
we
learn
of
him
in
his
writings
show
us
that
he
was
not
of
the
stern
stuff
which
makes
martyrs
and
heroes
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
suffer
for
a
cause
in
which
he
did
not
believe
so
dryden
turned
royalist
and
the
very
next
poem
he
wrote
was
on
the
happy
restoration
and
return
of
his
majesty
charles
the
second
how
easy
is
when
destiny
proves
kind
with
full
spread
sails
to
run
before
the
wind
redux
so
dryden
ran
before
the
wind
about
three
years
after
the
restoration
dryden
married
an
daughter
lady
elizabeth
howard
we
know
very
little
about
their
life
together
but
they
had
three
children
of
whom
they
were
very
fond
with
the
restoration
came
the
of
the
theaters
and
for
fourteen
years
dryden
was
known
as
a
dramatic
poet
there
is
little
need
to
tell
you
anything
about
his
plays
for
you
would
not
like
to
read
them
during
the
reign
of
puritanism
in
england
the
people
had
been
forbidden
even
innocent
pleasures
the
maypole
dances
had
been
banished
games
and
laughter
were
frowned
upon
now
that
these
too
stern
laws
had
been
taken
away
people
plunged
madly
into
pleasure
laughter
became
coarse
merriment
became
riotous
puritan
england
had
lost
the
sense
of
where
innocent
pleasure
ends
and
wickedness
begins
in
another
way
restoration
england
did
the
same
the
people
of
the
restoration
saw
fun
and
laughter
in
plays
which
seem
to
us
now
simply
vulgar
and
coarse
as
well
as
dull
the
coarseness
too
is
not
the
coarseness
of
an
ignorant
people
who
know
no
better
but
rather
of
a
people
who
do
know
better
and
who
yet
prefer
to
be
coarse
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
there
are
no
characters
no
beautiful
lines
in
dryden
plays
for
that
would
not
be
true
many
of
them
are
clever
the
songs
in
them
are
often
beautiful
but
nearly
all
are
unpleasant
to
read
the
taste
of
the
restoration
times
condemned
dryden
to
write
in
a
way
unworthy
of
himself
for
money
neither
money
nor
honour
that
in
two
words
was
the
position
of
writers
after
the
restoration
le
public
et
les
hommes
de
lettres
in
angleterre
and
dryden
in
immortal
strain
had
raised
the
again
but
that
a
ribald
king
and
court
bade
him
toil
on
to
make
them
sport
demanding
for
their
niggard
pay
fit
for
their
souls
a
loser
lay
scott
marmion
had
dryden
written
nothing
but
plays
we
should
not
remember
him
as
one
of
our
great
poets
yet
it
was
during
this
time
of
writing
that
dryden
was
made
poet
laureate
and
historiographer
royal
with
the
salary
of
pounds
a
year
and
a
butt
of
sack
it
was
after
he
became
poet
laureate
that
dryden
began
to
write
his
satires
the
poems
for
which
he
is
most
famous
although
a
satire
is
a
poem
which
holds
wickedness
up
to
scorn
sometimes
it
was
used
not
against
the
wicked
and
the
foolish
but
against
those
who
merely
differed
from
the
writer
in
politics
or
religion
or
any
other
way
of
life
or
thought
such
was
dryden
best
satire
thought
by
some
people
the
best
in
the
english
language
it
is
called
absalom
and
achitophel
to
understand
it
we
must
know
and
understand
the
history
of
the
times
here
in
the
guise
of
the
old
bible
story
dryden
seeks
to
hold
lord
shaftesbury
up
to
scorn
because
he
tried
to
have
a
law
passed
which
would
prevent
the
king
brother
james
from
succeeding
to
the
throne
and
which
would
instead
place
the
duke
of
monmouth
there
when
the
poem
was
published
shaftesbury
was
in
the
tower
awaiting
his
trial
for
high
treason
the
poem
had
a
great
effect
but
shaftesbury
was
nevertheless
set
free
in
spite
of
the
fine
sounding
lines
you
will
perhaps
never
care
to
read
absalom
and
achitophel
save
as
a
footnote
to
history
but
dryden
was
the
age
of
satire
those
he
wrote
called
forth
others
he
was
surrounded
and
followed
by
many
imitators
and
it
is
well
to
remember
dryden
as
the
greatest
of
them
all
his
satires
were
so
powerful
too
that
the
people
against
whom
they
were
directed
felt
them
keenly
and
no
wonder
there
are
passages
in
dryden
satires
in
which
every
couplet
has
not
only
the
force
but
the
sound
of
a
slap
in
the
face
says
a
recent
writer
among
the
younger
writers
dryden
took
the
place
ben
jonson
used
hold
he
kinged
it
in
the
then
the
fashionable
place
at
which
the
wits
gathered
as
jonson
had
in
the
tavern
he
was
given
the
most
honored
seat
in
summer
by
the
window
in
winter
by
the
fire
and
although
he
was
not
a
great
talker
like
jonson
the
young
wits
crowded
around
him
eager
for
the
honor
of
a
word
or
a
pinch
from
the
great
man
besides
his
plays
and
satires
dryden
wrote
a
poem
in
support
of
the
english
church
called
religio
laici
then
a
few
years
later
when
charles
ii
died
and
james
ii
came
to
the
throne
dryden
turned
roman
catholic
and
wrote
a
poem
called
the
hind
and
the
panther
in
praise
of
the
church
of
rome
but
the
reign
of
james
ii
was
short
the
glorious
revolution
came
and
with
a
protestant
king
and
queen
upon
the
throne
the
catholic
poet
laureate
lost
his
post
and
pension
and
all
his
other
appointments
dryden
was
now
nearly
sixty
and
although
he
had
made
what
was
then
a
good
deal
of
money
by
his
plays
and
other
poems
he
had
spent
it
freely
and
always
seemed
in
need
now
he
had
to
face
want
and
poverty
but
he
faced
them
bravely
dryden
all
his
life
had
been
a
flatterer
he
had
always
sailed
with
the
wind
now
whether
he
could
not
or
would
not
he
changed
no
more
he
flattered
no
more
a
kind
friend
it
is
said
still
continued
to
pay
him
the
two
hundred
pounds
he
had
received
as
poet
laureate
and
he
now
wrote
more
plays
which
brought
him
money
then
thus
late
in
life
he
began
the
work
which
for
you
at
present
will
have
the
greatest
interest
dryden
was
a
great
poet
but
he
could
create
nothing
he
had
to
have
given
him
ideas
upon
which
to
work
now
he
began
translations
from
latin
poets
and
for
those
who
can
not
read
them
in
the
original
they
are
still
a
great
pleasure
and
delight
true
dryden
did
not
translate
literally
that
is
word
for
word
he
paraphrased
rather
and
in
doing
so
he
drydenized
the
originals
often
adding
whole
lines
of
his
own
among
his
translations
was
virgil
aeneid
which
long
before
you
remember
surrey
had
begun
in
blank
verse
but
blank
verse
was
not
what
the
age
in
which
dryden
lived
desired
and
he
knew
it
so
he
wrote
in
rimed
couplets
long
before
this
he
had
turned
paradise
lost
into
rimed
couplets
making
it
into
an
opera
which
he
called
the
state
of
innocence
an
opera
is
a
play
set
to
music
but
this
opera
was
never
set
to
music
and
never
sung
or
acted
dryden
we
know
admired
milton
poetry
greatly
this
man
cuts
us
all
out
he
had
said
yet
he
thought
he
could
make
the
poem
still
better
and
asked
milton
leave
to
turn
it
into
rime
ay
you
may
tag
my
verses
if
you
will
replied
the
great
blind
man
it
is
interesting
to
compare
the
two
poems
and
when
you
come
to
read
the
state
of
innocence
you
will
find
that
not
all
the
verses
are
tagged
so
that
in
places
you
can
compare
milton
blank
verse
with
dryden
and
although
dryden
must
have
thought
he
was
improving
milton
poem
he
says
himself
truly
i
should
be
sorry
for
my
own
sake
that
any
one
should
take
the
pains
to
compare
them
the
poems
together
the
original
being
undoubtedly
one
of
the
greatest
most
noble
and
most
sublime
poems
which
either
this
age
or
nation
has
produced
dryden
begins
his
poem
with
the
speech
of
satan
lucifer
he
calls
him
on
finding
himself
cast
out
from
heaven
is
this
the
seat
our
conqueror
has
given
and
this
the
climate
we
must
change
for
heaven
these
regions
and
this
realm
my
wars
have
got
this
mournful
empire
is
the
loser
lot
in
liquid
burnings
or
on
dry
to
dwell
is
all
the
sad
variety
of
hell
if
you
turn
back
to
page
you
can
compare
this
with
own
version
besides
translating
some
latin
and
a
few
greek
poems
dryden
translated
stories
from
boccaccio
chaucer
old
friend
and
last
of
all
he
translated
chaucer
himself
into
drydenese
for
in
dryden
day
chaucer
language
had
already
become
so
fashioned
that
few
people
troubled
to
read
him
it
is
so
obsolete
says
dryden
that
his
sense
is
scarce
to
be
understood
i
find
some
people
are
offended
that
i
have
turned
these
tales
into
modern
english
because
they
think
them
unworthy
of
my
pains
and
look
on
chaucer
as
a
dry
wit
not
worthy
reviving
again
he
says
but
there
are
other
judges
who
think
i
ought
not
to
have
translated
chaucer
into
english
out
of
a
quite
contrary
notion
they
suppose
there
is
a
certain
veneration
due
to
his
old
language
and
that
it
is
little
less
than
profanation
and
sacrilege
to
alter
it
they
are
further
of
opinion
that
somewhat
of
his
good
sense
will
suffer
in
this
transfusion
and
much
of
the
beauty
of
his
thoughts
will
infallibly
be
lost
which
appear
with
more
grace
in
their
old
habit
i
think
all
of
us
who
can
read
chaucer
in
his
own
language
must
agree
with
these
judges
but
dryden
goes
on
to
say
he
does
not
write
for
such
but
for
those
who
can
not
read
chaucer
english
are
they
who
can
understand
chaucer
to
deprive
the
greater
part
of
their
countrymen
of
the
same
advantage
and
hoard
him
up
as
misers
do
their
gold
only
to
look
on
it
themselves
and
hinder
others
from
making
use
of
it
he
asks
this
is
very
good
reasoning
and
all
that
can
be
said
against
it
is
that
when
dryden
has
done
with
chaucer
although
he
tells
the
same
tales
they
are
no
longer
chaucer
but
dryden
the
spirit
is
changed
but
that
you
will
be
able
to
feel
only
when
you
grow
older
and
are
able
to
read
the
two
and
balance
them
one
against
the
other
dryden
translated
only
a
few
of
the
canterbury
tales
and
the
one
he
liked
best
was
the
knight
tale
of
palamon
and
arcite
he
published
it
in
a
book
which
he
called
fables
and
it
is
i
think
as
a
narrative
or
poet
in
these
fables
and
in
his
translations
that
he
keeps
most
interest
for
the
young
people
of
you
have
by
this
time
i
hope
read
the
story
of
palamon
and
arcite
at
least
in
tales
from
chaucer
and
here
i
will
give
you
a
few
lines
first
from
dryden
and
then
from
chaucer
so
that
you
can
judge
for
yourselves
of
the
difference
in
them
the
poets
describe
emelia
as
she
appeared
on
that
may
morning
when
palamon
first
looked
forth
from
his
prison
and
saw
her
walk
in
the
garden
thus
year
by
year
they
pass
and
day
by
day
till
once
was
on
the
morn
of
cheerful
may
the
young
emila
fairer
to
be
seen
than
the
fair
lily
on
the
flowery
green
more
flesh
than
may
herself
in
blossoms
new
for
with
the
rosy
colour
strove
her
hue
waked
as
her
custom
was
before
the
day
to
do
the
observance
due
to
sprightly
may
for
sprightly
may
commands
our
youth
to
keep
the
vigils
of
her
night
and
breaks
their
sluggard
sleep
each
gentle
breast
with
kindly
warmth
she
moves
inspires
new
flames
revives
extinguished
loves
in
this
remembrance
emily
ere
day
arose
and
dressed
herself
in
rich
array
fresh
as
the
month
and
as
the
morning
fair
adown
her
shoulders
fell
her
length
of
hair
a
ribbon
did
the
braided
tresses
bind
the
rest
was
loose
and
wantoned
in
the
wind
aurora
had
but
newly
chased
the
night
and
purpled
the
sky
with
blushing
light
when
to
the
garden
walk
she
took
her
way
to
sport
and
trip
along
in
cool
of
day
and
offer
maiden
vows
in
honour
of
the
may
at
every
turn
she
made
a
little
stand
and
thrust
among
the
thorns
her
lily
hand
to
draw
the
rose
and
every
rose
she
drew
she
shook
the
stalk
and
brushed
away
the
dew
then
flowers
of
white
and
red
she
wove
to
make
a
garland
for
her
head
this
done
she
sang
and
carolled
out
so
clear
that
men
and
angels
might
rejoice
to
hear
even
wondering
philomel
forgot
to
sing
and
learned
from
her
to

as

she
song
in
this
quotation
from
chaucer
i
have
not
changed
the
old
spelling
into
modern
as
i
did
in
the
chapter
on
chaucer
so
that
you
may
see
the
difference
between
the
two
styles
more
clearly
if
you
can
see
the
difference
between
these
two
quotations
you
can
see
the
difference
between
the
poetry
of
dryden
age
and
all
that
went
before
him
it
is
the
difference
between
art
and
nature
chaucer
sings
like
a
bird
dryden
like
a
trained
concert
singer
who
knows
that
people
are
listening
to
him
there
is
room
for
both
in
life
we
want
and
need
both
if
you
can
feel
the
difference
between
chaucer
and
dryden
you
will
understand
in
part
what
i
meant
by
saying
that
dryden
was
the
expression
of
his
time
for
in
restoration
times
the
taste
was
for
art
rather
than
for
natural
beauty
the
taste
was
for
what
was
clever
witty
and
polished
rather
than
for
the
simple
stately
grandeur
of
what
was
real
and
true
poetry
was
utterly
changed
it
no
longer
went
to
the
heart
but
to
the
brain
dryden
poetry
does
not
make
the
tears
start
to
our
eye
or
the
blood
come
to
our
cheek
but
it
flatters
our
ear
with
its
smoothness
and
elegance
it
tickles
our
fancy
with
its
wit
you
will
understand
still
better
what
the
feeling
of
the
times
was
when
i
tell
you
that
dryden
with
the
help
of
another
poet
shakespeare
tempest
and
made
it
to
suit
the
fashion
of
the
day
in
doing
so
they
utterly
spoiled
it
as
literature
it
is
worthless
as
helping
us
to
understand
the
history
of
those
times
it
is
useful
but
although
the
tempest
as
by
dryden
is
bad
one
of
the
best
of
his
plays
is
founded
upon
another
of
shakespeare
this
play
is
called
all
for
love
or
the
world
well
lost
and
is
founded
upon
shakespeare
antony
and
cleopatra
it
is
not
written
in
dryden
favorite
heroic
couplet
but
in
blank
verse
in
my
style
he
says
i
have
professed
to
imitate
the
divine
shakespeare
which
that
i
might
perform
more
freely
i
have
disencumbered
myself
from
rhyme
not
that
i
condemn
my
former
way
but
that
this
is
more
proper
to
my
present
purpose
and
when
you
come
to
read
this
play
you
will
find
that
master
as
dryden
was
of
the
heroic
couplet
he
could
write
too
when
he
chose
fine
blank
verse
perhaps
the
of
all
dryden
shorter
poems
is
the
ode
called
alexander
feast
it
was
written
for
a
london
musical
society
which
gave
a
concert
each
year
on
cecilia
day
when
an
original
ode
was
sung
in
her
honor
dryden
in
this
ode
which
was
sung
in
pictures
timotheus
the
famous
greek
musician
and
poet
singing
before
alexander
at
a
great
feast
which
was
held
after
the
conquest
of
persia
alexander
listens
while
the
lovely
thais
by
his
side
sate
like
a
blooming
eastern
bride
in
flower
of
youth
and
beauty
pride
happy
happy
happy
pair
none
but
the
brave
none
but
the
brave
none
but
the
brave
deserves
the
fair
as
timotheus
sings
he
stirs
at
will
his
hearers
hearts
to
love
to
pity
or
to
revenge
timotheus
to
his
breathing
flute
and
sounding
lyre
could
swell
the
soul
to
rage
or
kindle
soft
desire
but
those
were
heathen
times
in
christian
times
came
cecilia
and
she
enlarged
the
former
narrow
bounds
and
added
length
to
solemn
sounds
with
nature
and
arts
unknown
before
let
old
timotheus
yield
the
prize
or
both
divide
the
crown
he
raised
a
mortal
to
the
skies
she
drew
an
angel
down
dryden
was
a
great
poet
and
he
dominated
his
own
age
and
the
age
to
come
but
besides
being
a
poet
he
was
a
great
his
prose
is
clear
and
fine
and
almost
modern
we
do
not
have
to
follow
him
through
sentences
so
long
that
we
lose
the
sense
before
we
come
to
the
end
he
found
english
of
brick
and
left
it
marble
says
a
late
writer
and
when
we
read
his
prose
we
almost
believe
that
saying
to
be
true
he
was
the
first
of
modern
critics
that
is
he
was
able
to
judge
the
works
of
others
surely
and
well
and
many
of
his
criticisms
of
men
were
so
true
that
we
accept
them
now
even
as
they
were
accepted
then
here
is
what
he
says
of
chaucer
in
his
preface
to
the
fables
he
chaucer
must
have
been
a
man
of
a
most
wonderful
comprehensive
nature
because
as
it
has
been
truly
observed
of
him
he
has
taken
into
the
compass
of
his
canterbury
tales
the
various
manners
and
humours
as
we
now
call
them
of
the
whole
english
nation
in
his
age
not
a
single
character
has
escaped
him
all
his
pilgrims
are
severally
distinguished
from
each
other
and
not
only
in
their
inclinations
but
in
their
very
physiognomies
persons
the
matter
and
manner
of
their
tales
and
of
their
telling
are
so
suited
to
their
different
educations
humours
and
callings
that
each
of
them
would
be
improper
in
any
other
mouth
even
the
grave
and
serious
characters
are
distinguished
by
their
several
sorts
of
gravity
their
discourses
are
such
as
belong
to
their
age
their
calling
and
their
breeding
such
as
are
becoming
to
them
and
to
them
only
some
of
his
persons
are
vicious
and
some
virtuous
some
are
unlearned
or
as
chaucer
calls
them
lewd
and
some
are
learned
even
the
ribaldry
of
the
low
characters
is
different
the
reeve
the
miller
and
the
cook
are
several
men
and
distinguished
from
each
other
as
much
as
the
mincing
prioress
and
the
wife
of
bath
it
is
sufficient
to
say
according
to
the
proverb
that
here
is
god
plenty
we
have
our
forefathers
and
all
before
us
as
they
were
in
chaucer
days
their
general
characters
are
still
remaining
in
mankind
and
even
in
england
though
they
are
called
by
other
names
than
those
of
monks
and
friars
and
canons
and
lady
abbesses
and
nuns
for
mankind
is
ever
the
same
and
nothing
lost
out
of
nature
though
everything
is
altered
the
fables
was
the
last
book
dryden
wrote
he
was
growing
to
be
an
old
man
and
a
few
months
after
it
was
published
he
became
very
john
dryden
the
famous
poet
lies
said
the
newspapers
on
the
april
one
may
morning
he
closed
his
eyes
for
ever
just
as
aurora
had
but
newly
chased
the
night
and
purpled
the
sky
with
blushing
light
chapter
lxi
defoe
the
first
newspapers
to
almost
every
house
in
the
land
as
regular
as
the
milk
man
more
regular
than
the
postman
there
comes
each
morning
the
newspaper
boy
to
most
of
us
breakfast
means
as
well
as
things
to
eat
mother
pouring
out
the
tea
and
father
reading
the
newspaper
as
mother
passes
father
tea
she
says
anything
in
the
paper
john
and
how
often
he
answers
nothing
nothing
whatever
although
father
says
there
is
nothing
in
the
paper
there
is
a
great
deal
of
reading
in
it
that
we
can
see
and
now
comes
the
question
who
writes
it
all
who
writes
this
thin
flat
book
of
six
or
eight
great
pages
which
every
morning
we
buy
for
a
penny
or
a
halfpenny
but
perhaps
you
think
it
does
not
matter
who
writes
the
newspapers
for
the
newspaper
is
not
literature
literature
means
real
books
with
covers
dear
possessions
to
be
loved
and
taken
care
of
to
be
read
and
read
again
but
a
newspaper
is
hardly
read
at
all
when
it
is
crumpled
up
and
used
to
light
the
fire
and
no
one
minds
for
who
could
love
a
newspaper
who
cares
to
treasure
it
and
read
it
again
and
yet
again
we
do
not
want
even
to
read
yesterday
newspapers
for
newspapers
seem
to
hold
for
us
only
the
interest
of
the
day
the
very
name
by
which
they
used
to
be
called
journal
seems
to
tell
us
that
for
it
comes
from
the
french
word
jour
meaning
a
day
newspapers
give
us
the
news
of
the
day
for
the
day
yet
in
them
we
find
the
history
of
our
own
times
and
we
are
constantly
kept
in
mind
of
how
important
they
are
in
our
everyday
life
by
such
phrases
as
the
freedom
of
the
press
the
opinion
of
the
press
the
press
meaning
all
the
newspapers
journals
and
magazines
and
the
people
who
write
for
them
so
we
come
back
again
to
our
question
who
writes
for
the
newspapers
the
answer
is
the
journalists
a
newspaper
is
not
all
the
work
of
one
man
but
of
many
whose
names
we
seldom
know
but
who
work
together
so
that
each
morning
we
may
have
our
paper
and
in
this
chapter
i
want
to
tell
you
about
one
of
our
first
real
journalists
daniel
defoe
of
course
you
know
of
him
already
for
he
wrote
robinson
crusoe
and
he
is
perhaps
your
favorite
author
but
before
he
was
an
author
he
was
a
journalist
and
as
i
say
one
of
our
first
for
there
was
a
time
when
there
were
no
newspapers
nothing
for
father
to
read
at
and
no
old
newspapers
to
crumple
up
and
light
fires
with
the
first
real
printed
english
newspaper
was
called
the
weekly
news
it
was
published
in
while
king
charles
i
was
still
upon
the
throne
but
this
first
paper
and
others
that
came
after
it
were
very
small
the
whole
paper
was
not
so
large
as
a
page
of
one
of
our
present
halfpenny
papers
the
news
was
told
baldly
without
any
remarks
upon
it
and
when
there
was
not
enough
news
it
was
the
fashion
to
fill
up
the
space
with
chapters
from
the
bible
sometimes
too
a
space
was
left
blank
on
purpose
so
that
those
who
bought
the
paper
in
town
might
write
in
their
own
little
bit
of
news
before
sending
it
off
to
country
friends
defoe
was
one
of
the
first
to
change
this
to
write
articles
and
comments
upon
the
news
gradually
newspapers
became
plentiful
and
when
government
by
party
became
the
settled
form
of
our
government
each
party
had
its
own
newspaper
and
used
it
to
help
on
its
own
side
and
abuse
the
other
milton
and
dryden
were
really
journalists
milton
when
he
wrote
his
political
pamphlets
and
dryden
when
he
wrote
absalom
and
achitophel
and
other
poems
of
that
kind
but
they
were
poets
first
journalists
by
accident
defoe
was
a
journalist
first
though
by
nature
ever
a
daniel
defoe
born
in
was
the
son
of
a
london
butcher
names
james
foe
why
daniel
who
prided
himself
on
being
a
englishman
frenchified
his
name
by
adding
a
de
to
it
we
do
not
know
and
he
was
over
forty
before
he
changed
plain
foe
into
defoe
daniel
father
and
mother
were
puritans
and
he
was
sent
to
school
with
the
idea
that
he
should
become
a
nonconformist
minister
but
defoe
did
not
become
a
minister
perhaps
he
felt
he
was
unsuited
for
such
solemn
duty
the
pulpit
he
says
later
is
none
of
my
office
it
was
my
disaster
first
to
be
set
apart
for
and
then
to
be
set
apart
from
the
honor
of
that
sacred
employ
defoe
never
went
to
college
and
because
of
this
many
a
time
in
later
days
his
enemies
taunted
him
with
being
ignorant
and
unlearned
he
felt
these
taunts
bitterly
and
again
and
again
answered
them
in
his
writings
i
have
been
in
my
time
pretty
well
master
of
five
languages
he
says
in
one
place
i
have
also
illiterate
though
i
am
made
a
little
progress
in
science
i
have
read
euclid
elements
i
have
read
logic
i
went
some
length
in
physics
i
thought
myself
master
of
geography
and
to
possess
sufficient
skill
in
astronomy
yet
he
says
i
am
no
scholar
when
defoe
left
school
he
went
into
the
office
of
a
merchant
hosier
it
was
while
he
was
in
this
office
that
king
charles
ii
died
and
king
james
ii
came
to
the
throne
almost
at
once
there
followed
the
duke
of
monmouth
rebellion
the
duke
was
a
protestant
and
james
was
a
catholic
there
were
many
in
the
land
who
feared
a
catholic
king
and
who
believed
too
that
the
duke
had
more
right
to
the
throne
than
james
so
they
joined
the
rebellion
among
them
was
daniel
but
the
rebellion
came
to
nothing
in
a
few
weeks
the
duke
army
was
scattered
in
flight
and
he
himself
a
wretched
prisoner
in
the
tower
happier
than
many
of
his
comrades
defoe
succeeded
in
escaping
death
or
even
punishment
secretly
and
safely
he
returned
to
london
and
there
quietly
again
took
up
his
trade
of
merchant
hosier
but
he
did
not
lose
his
interest
in
the
affairs
of
his
country
and
when
the
glorious
revolution
came
he
was
one
of
those
who
rode
out
to
meet
and
welcome
william
the
deliverer
but
perhaps
he
allowed
politics
to
take
up
too
much
of
his
time
and
thought
for
although
he
was
a
good
business
man
he
failed
and
had
to
hide
from
those
to
whom
he
owed
money
but
soon
we
find
him
setting
to
work
again
to
mend
his
fortunes
he
became
first
secretary
to
and
then
part
owner
of
a
tile
and
brick
factory
and
in
a
few
years
made
enough
money
to
pay
off
all
his
old
debts
by
this
time
defoe
had
begun
to
write
and
was
already
known
as
a
clever
author
now
some
one
wrote
a
book
accusing
william
among
many
other
crimes
of
being
a
foreigner
defoe
says
this
filled
me
with
a
kind
of
rage
and
he
replied
with
a
poem
called
the
englishman
it
became
popular
at
once
thousands
of
copies
being
sold
in
the
first
few
months
every
one
read
it
from
the
king
in
his
palace
to
the
workman
in
his
hut
and
long
afterwards
defoe
was
content
to
sign
his
books
by
the
author
of
englishman
it
made
defoe
known
to
the
king
this
poem
he
said
was
the
occasion
of
my
being
known
to
his
majesty
he
was
received
and
employed
by
him
and
above
the
capacity
of
my
deserving
rewarded
he
was
given
a
small
appointment
in
the
civil
service
all
his
life
after
defoe
loved
king
william
and
was
his
staunch
friend
using
all
the
power
of
his
clever
pen
to
make
the
unloved
dutch
king
better
understood
of
his
people
but
when
king
william
died
and
queen
anne
ruled
in
his
stead
defoe
fell
on
evil
times
in
those
days
the
quarrels
about
religion
were
not
yet
over
there
was
a
party
in
the
church
which
would
very
willingly
have
seen
the
nonconformists
or
dissenters
persecuted
dissenters
were
like
to
have
an
evil
time
to
show
how
wrong
persecution
was
defoe
wrote
a
little
pamphlet
which
he
called
the
shortest
way
with
the
dissenters
he
wrote
as
if
he
were
very
angry
indeed
with
the
dissenters
he
said
they
had
been
far
too
kindly
treated
and
that
if
he
had
his
way
he
would
make
a
law
that
whoever
was
found
at
a
conventicle
should
be
banished
the
nation
and
the
preacher
be
hanged
we
should
soon
see
an
end
of
the
tale
they
would
all
come
to
church
and
one
age
would
make
us
all
one
again
defoe
meant
this
for
satire
a
satire
is
you
remember
a
work
which
holds
up
folly
or
wickedness
to
ridicule
he
meant
to
show
the
high
churchmen
how
absurd
and
wicked
was
their
desire
to
punish
the
dissenters
for
worshiping
god
in
their
own
way
he
meant
to
make
the
world
laugh
at
them
but
at
first
the
high
churchmen
did
not
see
that
it
was
meant
to
ridicule
them
they
greeted
the
author
of
this
pamphlet
as
a
friend
and
ally
the
dissenters
did
not
see
the
satire
either
and
found
in
the
writer
a
new
and
most
bitter
enemy
but
when
at
last
defoe
meaning
became
plain
the
high
church
party
was
very
angry
and
resolved
to
punish
him
defoe
fled
into
hiding
but
a
reward
of
fifty
pounds
was
offered
for
his
discovery
and
rather
than
others
should
be
ruined
by
his
mistake
defoe
gave
himself
up
for
having
written
a
scandalous
and
seditious
pamphlet
defoe
was
condemned
to
pay
a
large
fine
to
stand
three
times
in
the
pillory
and
to
be
imprisoned
during
the
queen
pleasure
thus
quickly
did
fortune
wheel
turn
round
i
have
seen
the
rough
side
of
the
world
as
well
as
the
smooth
he
said
long
after
i
have
in
less
than
half
a
year
tasted
the
difference
between
the
closet
of
a
king
and
the
dungeon
of
newgate
the
pillory
was
a
terrible
punishment
in
a
public
place
raised
on
a
platform
in
full
view
of
the
passing
crowd
the
victim
stood
round
his
neck
was
a
heavy
collar
of
wood
and
in
this
collar
his
hands
were
also
confined
thus
he
stood
helpless
unable
to
protect
himself
either
from
the
sun
or
rain
or
from
the
insults
of
the
crowd
for
a
man
in
the
pillory
was
a
fitting
object
for
laughter
and
rude
jests
to
be
jeered
at
to
have
mud
thrown
at
him
was
part
of
his
punishment
but
for
defoe
it
was
a
triumph
rather
than
a
punishment
to
the
common
people
he
was
already
a
hero
so
they
formed
a
guard
round
him
to
protect
him
from
the
mud
and
rotten
eggs
his
enemies
would
now
thrown
they
themselves
threw
flowers
they
wreathed
the
pillory
with
roses
and
with
laurel
till
it
seemed
a
place
of
honor
rather
than
of
disgrace
they
sang
songs
in
his
praise
and
drank
to
his
health
and
wished
those
who
had
sent
him
there
stood
in
his
place
thus
through
all
the
long
hot
july
hours
defoe
was
upheld
and
comforted
in
his
disgrace
and
to
show
that
his
spirit
was
untouched
by
his
sentence
he
wrote
a
hymn
to
the
pillory
this
was
bought
and
read
and
shouted
in
the
ears
of
his
enemies
by
thousands
of
the
people
it
was
a
more
daring
satire
than
even
the
shortest
way
in
the
end
of
it
defoe
calls
upon
the
pillory
thou
bugbear
of
the
law
to
speak
and
say
why
he
stands
there
tell
them
it
was
because
he
was
too
bold
and
told
those
truths
which
should
not
have
been
told
extol
the
justice
of
the
land
who
punish
what
they
will
not
understand
tell
them
he
stands
exalted
there
for
speaking
what
we
would
not
hear
and
yet
he
might
have
been
secure
had
he
said
less
or
would
he
have
said
more
tell
them
the
men
that
placed
him
here
are
scandals
to
the
times
are
at
a
loss
to
find
his
guilt
and
ca
commit
his
crimes
but
although
defoe
friends
could
take
the
sting
out
of
the
terrible
hours
during
which
he
stood
as
an
object
for
mockery
they
could
do
little
else
for
him
so
he
went
back
to
prison
to
remain
there
during
the
queen
pleasure
this
of
course
meant
ruin
to
him
for
himself
he
could
bear
it
but
he
had
a
wife
and
children
and
to
know
that
they
were
in
poverty
and
bitter
want
was
his
hardest
punishment
from
prison
defoe
could
not
manage
his
factory
he
had
to
let
that
go
losing
with
it
thousands
of
pounds
for
the
second
time
he
saw
himself
ruined
but
he
had
still
left
to
him
his
pen
and
his
undaunted
courage
so
besides
writing
many
pamphlets
in
prison
defoe
started
a
paper
called
the
review
it
appeared
at
first
once
then
twice
and
at
last
three
times
a
week
unlike
our
papers
of
which
are
written
by
many
hands
defoe
wrote
the
whole
of
the
review
himself
and
continued
to
do
so
for
years
it
contained
very
little
news
and
many
articles
and
when
we
turn
these
worn
and
yellowing
pages
we
find
much
that
interesting
in
those
days
has
lost
interest
for
us
but
we
also
find
articles
which
worded
in
clear
strong
truly
english
english
seem
to
us
as
fresh
and
full
of
life
as
when
they
were
written
more
than
two
hundred
years
ago
we
find
as
well
much
that
is
of
keen
historical
interest
and
we
gain
some
idea
of
the
undaunted
courage
of
the
author
when
we
remember
that
the
first
numbers
of
the
review
at
least
were
penned
in
a
loathsome
prison
where
highwaymen
pirates
and
common
thieves
were
his
chief
companions
chapter
lxii
defoe
robinson
crusoe
for
more
than
a
year
and
a
half
defoe
remained
in
prison
then
he
was
set
free
a
new
government
had
come
into
power
it
was
pointed
out
to
the
queen
that
it
was
a
mistake
to
make
an
enemy
of
so
clever
an
author
as
defoe
then
he
was
set
at
liberty
but
on
condition
that
he
should
use
his
pen
to
support
the
government
so
although
defoe
was
now
free
to
all
seeming
this
was
really
the
beginning
of
bondage
he
was
no
longer
free
in
mind
and
by
degrees
he
became
a
mere
of
government
selling
the
support
of
his
pen
to
whichever
party
was
in
power
we
can
not
follow
him
through
all
the
twists
and
turns
of
his
politics
nor
through
all
his
ups
and
downs
in
life
nor
mention
all
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
books
and
pamphlets
that
he
wrote
it
was
an
adventurous
life
he
led
full
of
dark
and
shadowy
passages
which
we
can
not
understand
and
so
perhaps
can
not
pardon
but
whether
he
sold
his
pen
or
no
we
are
bound
to
confess
that
defoe
desire
was
towards
the
good
towards
peace
union
and
justice
one
thing
he
fought
for
with
all
his
buoyant
strength
was
the
union
between
england
and
scotland
it
had
been
the
desire
of
william
iii
ere
he
died
it
had
now
become
the
still
stronger
desire
of
queen
anne
and
her
ministers
so
defoe
took
a
long
winter
a
chargeable
and
as
it
proved
hazardous
journey
to
scotland
there
he
threw
himself
into
the
struggle
doing
all
he
could
for
the
union
he
has
left
for
us
a
history
of
that
struggle
which
perhaps
better
than
any
other
makes
us
realize
the
unrest
of
the
scottish
people
the
anger
the
fear
the
indecision
with
which
they
were
filled
people
went
up
and
down
wondering
and
amazed
expecting
every
day
strange
events
afraid
of
peace
afraid
of
war
many
knew
not
which
way
to
fix
their
resolution
they
could
not
be
clear
for
the
union
yet
they
saw
death
at
the
door
in
its
breaking
off
death
to
their
liberty
to
their
religion
and
to
their
country
better
than
any
other
he
gives
a
picture
of
the
infinite
struggles
clamor
railing
and
tumult
of
party
let
me
give
in
his
own
words
a
description
of
a
riot
in
the
streets
of
edinburgh
of
the
union
of
great
britain
the
rabble
by
shouting
and
noise
having
increased
their
numbers
to
several
thousands
they
began
with
sir
patrick
johnston
who
was
one
of
the
treaters
and
the
year
before
had
been
lord
provost
first
they
assaulted
his
lodging
with
stones
and
sticks
and
curses
not
a
few
but
his
windows
being
too
high
they
came
up
the
stairs
to
his
door
and
fell
to
work
at
it
with
sledges
or
great
hammers
and
had
they
broke
it
open
in
their
first
fury
he
had
without
doubt
been
torn
to
pieces
without
mercy
and
this
only
because
he
was
a
treater
in
the
commission
to
england
for
before
that
no
man
was
so
well
beloved
as
he
over
the
whole
city
his
lady
in
the
utmost
despair
with
this
fright
came
to
the
window
with
two
candles
in
her
hand
that
she
might
be
known
and
cried
out
for
god
sake
to
call
the
guards
an
honest
apothecary
in
the
town
who
knew
her
voice
and
saw
the
distress
she
was
in
and
to
whom
the
family
under
god
is
obliged
for
their
deliverance
ran
immediately
down
to
the
town
guard
but
they
would
not
stir
without
the
lord
provost
order
but
that
being
soon
obtained
one
captain
richardson
who
commanded
taking
about
thirty
men
with
him
marched
bravely
up
to
them
and
making
his
way
with
great
resolution
through
the
crowd
they
flying
but
throwing
stones
and
hallooing
at
him
and
his
men
he
seized
the
foot
of
the
stair
case
and
then
boldly
went
up
cleared
the
stair
and
took
six
of
the
rabble
in
the
very
act
and
so
delivered
the
gentleman
and
his
family
but
this
did
not
put
a
stop
to
the
general
tumult
though
it
delivered
this
particular
family
for
the
rabble
by
this
time
were
prodigiously
increased
and
went
roving
up
and
down
the
town
breaking
the
windows
of
the
members
of
parliament
and
insulting
them
in
their
coaches
in
the
streets
they
put
out
all
the
lights
that
they
might
not
be
discovered
and
the
author
of
this
had
one
great
stone
thrown
at
him
for
but
looking
out
of
a
window
for
they
suffered
nobody
to
look
out
especially
with
any
lights
lest
they
should
know
faces
and
inform
against
them
afterwards
by
this
time
it
was
about
eight
or
nine
at
night
and
now
they
were
absolute
masters
of
the
city
and
it
was
reported
they
were
going
to
shut
up
all
the
ports
the
lord
commissioner
being
informed
of
that
sent
a
party
of
the
foot
guards
and
took
possession
of
the
netherbow
which
is
a
gate
in
the
middle
of
the
high
street
as
temple
bar
between
the
city
of
london
and
the
court
in
the
city
wall
the
city
was
now
in
a
terrible
fright
and
everybody
was
under
concern
for
their
friends
the
rabble
went
raving
about
the
streets
till
midnight
frequently
beating
drums
raising
more
people
when
my
lord
commissioner
being
informed
there
were
a
thousand
of
the
seamen
and
rabble
come
up
from
leith
and
apprehending
if
it
were
suffered
to
go
on
it
might
come
to
a
dangerous
head
and
be
out
of
his
power
to
suppress
he
sent
for
the
lord
provost
and
demanded
that
the
guards
should
march
into
the
city
the
lord
provost
after
some
difficulty
yielded
though
it
was
alleged
that
it
was
what
never
was
known
in
edinburgh
before
about
one
in
the
morning
a
battalion
of
the
guards
entered
the
town
marched
up
to
the
parliament
close
and
took
post
in
all
the
avenues
of
the
city
which
prevented
the
resolutions
taken
to
insult
the
houses
of
the
rest
of
the
treaters
the
rabble
were
entirely
reduced
by
this
and
gradually
dispersed
and
so
the
tumult
ended
although
defoe
did
all
he
could
to
bring
the
union
about
he
felt
for
and
with
the
poor
distracted
people
he
saw
that
amid
the
strife
of
parties
proud
ignorant
mistaken
it
may
be
the
people
were
still
swayed
by
love
of
country
love
of
freedom
even
after
the
union
was
accomplished
defoe
remained
in
scotland
he
still
wrote
his
review
every
week
and
filled
it
so
full
of
union
matters
that
his
readers
began
to
think
he
could
speak
of
nothing
else
and
that
he
was
grown
dull
in
his
review
he
wrote
nothing
but
union
union
says
one
now
that
wants
diversion
i
am
quite
tired
of
it
and
we
hope
is
as
good
as
over
now
prithee
good
review
let
have
now
and
then
a
touch
of
something
else
to
make
us
merry
but
defoe
assures
his
readers
he
means
to
go
on
writing
about
the
union
until
he
can
see
some
prospect
of
calm
among
the
men
who
are
trying
to
make
dispeace
then
i
shall
be
the
first
that
shall
cease
calling
upon
them
to
peace
the
years
went
on
defoe
always
living
a
stormy
life
amid
the
clash
of
party
politics
always
writing
writing
more
than
once
his
noisy
journalistic
pen
brought
him
to
prison
but
he
was
never
a
prisoner
long
never
long
silenced
yet
although
defoe
wrote
so
much
and
lived
at
a
time
when
england
was
full
of
witty
writers
he
was
outside
the
charmed
circle
of
wits
who
pretended
not
to
know
of
his
existence
one
of
these
authors
says
another
writer
the
fellow
that
was
pilloried
i
have
forgotten
his
name
is
indeed
so
grave
sententious
dogmatical
a
rogue
that
there
is
no
enduring
him
swift
at
length
when
defoe
was
nearly
sixty
years
old
he
wrote
the
book
which
has
brought
him
and
enduring
fame
need
i
tell
you
of
that
book
surely
not
for
who
does
not
know
robinson
crusoe
or
as
the
first
title
ran
the
life
and
strange
surprising
adventures
of
robinson
crusoe
of
york
mariner
who
lived
years
all
alone
in
an
uninhabited
island
on
the
coast
of
america
near
the
mouth
of
the
great
river
oroonoque
having
been
cast
on
shore
by
shipwreck
wherein
all
the
men
perished
but
himself
with
an
account
how
he
was
at
last
strangely
delivered
by
pirates
written
by
himself
in
those
days
you
see
they
were
not
afraid
of
long
titles
the
book
too
is
long
yet
as
another
great
writer
says
was
there
ever
anything
written
by
mere
man
that
was
wished
longer
by
its
readers
except
don
quixote
robinson
crusoe
and
the
progress
johnson
the
book
was
a
tremendous
success
it
pleased
the
men
and
women
and
children
of
two
hundred
years
ago
as
much
as
it
pleases
them
within
a
few
months
four
editions
had
been
sold
since
then
till
now
there
has
never
been
a
time
when
robinson
crusoe
has
not
been
read
the
editions
of
it
have
been
countless
it
has
been
edited
and
it
has
been
translated
and
abridged
turned
into
shorthand
and
into
poetry
and
published
in
every
form
imaginable
and
at
every
price
from
one
penny
to
many
pounds
defoe
got
the
idea
of
his
story
from
the
adventures
of
a
scots
sailor
named
alexander
selkirk
this
sailor
quarreled
with
his
captain
and
was
set
ashore
upon
an
uninhabited
island
where
he
remained
alone
for
more
than
four
years
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
was
rescued
by
a
passing
ship
and
brought
home
to
england
out
of
this
slender
tale
defoe
made
his
fascinating
story
so
full
of
adventure
what
holds
us
in
the
story
is
its
seeming
truth
as
we
read
it
we
forget
altogether
that
it
is
only
a
story
we
feel
sure
that
crusoe
really
lived
that
all
his
adventures
really
happened
and
if
you
ever
read
any
more
of
defoe
books
you
will
find
that
this
feeling
runs
through
them
all
defoe
was
in
fact
a
born
like
sir
john
mandeville
with
an
amazing
show
of
truth
he
was
continually
deceiving
people
he
was
a
great
a
truly
great
liar
perhaps
the
greatest
liar

we
all
know
what
it
is
to
feel
hurt
and
angry
to
feel
that
we
are
misunderstood
that
no
one
loves
us
at
such
times
it
may
be
we
want
to
hurt
ourselves
so
that
in
some
mysterious
way
we
may
hurt
those
who
do
not
love
us
we
long
to
die
so
that
they
may
be
sorry
but
these
feelings
do
not
come
often
and
they
soon
pass
we
cry
ourselves
to
sleep
perhaps
and
wake
up
to
find
the
evil
thoughts
are
gone
we
forget
all
about
them
or
if
we
remember
them
we
remember
to
smile
at
our
own
foolishness
for
we
know
that
after
all
we
are
understood
we
are
loved
and
when
we
grow
old
enough
to
look
back
upon
those
times
although
we
may
remember
the
pain
of
them
we
can
see
that
sometimes
they
came
from
our
own
fault
it
was
not
that
we
were
misunderstood
so
much
as
that
we
were
misunderstanding
yet
whether
it
be
our
own
fault
or
not
when
such
times
do
come
the
world
seems
very
dark
and
life
seems
full
of
pain
then
think
of
what
a
whole
life
filled
with
these
evil
thoughts
must
be
think
of
a
whole
life
made
terrible
with
bitter
feelings
that
would
be
misery
indeed
yet
when
we
read
the
sad
story
of
the
life
of
jonathan
swift
who
has
in
gulliver
travels
given
to
countless
children
and
up
people
too
countless
hours
of
pleasure
we
are
forced
to
believe
that
so
he
passed
a
great
part
of
his
life
swift
was
misunderstood
and
misunderstanding
it
was
not
that
he
had
no
love
given
to
him
for
all
his
life
through
he
found
women
to
love
him
but
it
was
his
unhappiness
that
he
took
that
love
only
to
turn
it
to
bitterness
in
his
heart
that
he
took
that
love
so
as
to
leave
a
stain
on
him
and
it
ever
after
he
had
friendship
too
but
in
the
hands
stretched
out
to
help
him
in
his
need
he
saw
only
insult
in
the
kindness
that
was
given
to
him
he
saw
only
a
grudging
charity
and
yet
he
was
angry
with
the
world
and
with
man
that
he
did
not
receive
more
in
the
life
of
jonathan
swift
there
are
things
which
puzzle
even
the
wisest
children
would
find
those
things
still
harder
to
understand
so
i
will
not
try
to
explain
them
but
will
tell
you
a
little
that
you
will
readily
follow
about
the
life
of
this
lonely
man
with
the
biting
pen
and
aching
heart
jonathan
swift
father
and
mother
were
very
poor
so
poor
indeed
that
their
friends
said
it
was
folly
for
them
to
marry
and
when
after
about
two
years
of
married
life
the
husband
died
he
left
his
young
wife
burdened
with
debts
and
with
a
little
baby
girl
to
keep
it
was
not
until
a
few
months
after
his
father
death
that
jonathan
was
born
his
mother
was
a
cheerful
woman
and
although
her
little
son
came
to
her
in
the
midst
of
such
sorrow
she
no
doubt
loved
him
and
his
nurse
loved
him
too
little
jonathan
father
and
mother
were
english
but
because
he
was
born
in
dublin
and
because
he
spent
a
great
deal
of
his
life
there
he
has
sometimes
been
looked
upon
as
an
irishman
jonathan
nurse
was
also
an
englishwoman
and
when
he
was
about
a
year
old
she
was
called
home
to
england
to
a
dying
friend
she
saw
that
she
must
go
to
her
friend
but
she
loved
her
so
much
that
she
could
not
bear
to
part
from
him
he
had
been
a
sickly
child
often
ill
but
that
seemed
only
to
make
him
dearer
to
her
she
held
him
in
her
arms
thinking
how
empty
they
would
fell
without
their
dear
burden
she
kissed
him
jealous
at
the
thought
that
he
might
learn
to
know
and
love
another
nurse
and
she
felt
that
she
could
not
part
with
him
making
up
her
mind
that
she
would
not
she
wrapped
him
up
warmly
and
slipped
quietly
from
the
house
carrying
the
baby
in
her
arms
she
then
ran
quickly
to
the
boat
crept
on
board
and
was
well
out
on
the
irish
sea
before
it
was
discovered
that
she
had
stolen
little
jonathan
from
his
mother
mrs
swift
was
poor
jonathan
was
not
strong
so
the
fond
and
daring
nurse
was
allowed
by
the
mother
to
keep
her
little
charge
until
he
was
nearly
four
thus
for
three
years
little
jonathan
lived
with
his
nurse
at
whitehaven
growing
strong
and
brown
in
the
sea
air
she
looked
after
him
lovingly
and
besides
feeding
and
clothing
him
taught
him
so
well
that
swift
tells
us
himself
though
it
seems
a
little
hard
to
believe
that
he
could
spell
and
could
read
any
chapter
in
the
bible
before
he
was
three
after
jonathan
return
to
ireland
his
uncle
godwin
swift
seems
to
have
taken
charge
of
him
and
when
he
was
six
to
have
sent
him
to
a
good
school
his
mother
meanwhile
went
home
to
her
own
people
in
england
and
although
mother
and
son
loved
each
other
they
were
little
together
all
through
life
at
fourteen
godwin
swift
sent
his
nephew
from
school
to
trinity
college
dublin
but
swift
was
by
this
time
old
enough
to
know
that
he
was
living
on
the
charity
of
his
uncle
and
the
knowledge
was
bitter
to
his
proud
spirit
instead
of
spurring
him
on
the
knowledge
weighed
him
down
he
became
gloomy
idle
and
wild
he
afterwards
said
he
was
a
dunce
at
college
and
was
stopped
of
his
degree
for
dulness
and
insufficiency
but
although
at
first
the
examiners
refused
to
pass
him
he
was
later
for
some
reason
given
a
special
degree
granted
by
favor
rather
than
gained
by
desert
in
a
manner
little
to
his
credit
says
bitter
swift
jonathan
gave
his
uncle
neither
love
nor
thanks
for
his
schooling
he
gave
me
the
education
of
a
dog
was
how
he
spoke
of
it
years
after
yet
he
had
been
sent
to
the
best
school
in
ireland
and
to
college
later
but
perhaps
it
was
not
so
much
the
gift
as
the
manner
of
giving
which
swift
scorned
we
can
not
tell
soon
after
jonathan
left
college
he
went
to
live
in
the
house
of
sir
william
temple
temple
was
a
great
man
in
his
day
he
had
been
an
ambassador
the
friend
of
kings
and
princes
and
he
considered
himself
something
of
a
scholar
to
him
swift
acted
as
a
kind
of
secretary
to
a
proud
man
the
post
of
secretary
or
chaplain
in
a
great
house
was
in
those
days
no
happy
one
it
was
a
position
something
between
that
of
a
servant
and
a
friend
and
in
it
swift
haughty
soul
suffered
torments
sir
william
no
doubt
meant
to
be
kind
but
he
was
cold
and
condescending
and
not
a
little
pompous
and
conceited
swift
fierce
pride
was
ready
to
fancy
insults
where
none
were
meant
he
resented
being
treated
like
a
schoolboy
and
during
the
years
he
passed
in
sir
william
house
he
gathered
a
store
of
bitterness
against
the
world
in
his
heart
but
in
spite
of
all
his
miseries
real
or
imaginary
swift
had
at
least
one
pleasure
among
the
many
people
making
up
the
great
household
there
was
a
little
girl
of
seven
named
esther
johnson
she
was
a
delicate
little
girl
with
large
eyes
and
black
hair
she
and
swift
soon
grew
to
be
friends
and
he
spent
his
happiest
hours
teaching
her
to
read
and
write
it
is
pleasant
to
think
of
the
gloomy
untrained
genius
throwing
off
his
gloom
and
bending
all
his
talents
to
the
task
of
teaching
and
amusing
this
little
delicate
child
of
seven
with
intervals
between
swift
remained
in
sir
william
household
for
about
five
years
here
he
began
to
write
poetry
but
when
he
showed
his
poems
to
dryden
who
was
a
distant
kinsman
he
got
little
encouragement
cousin
swift
said
the
great
man
you
will
never
be
a
poet
here
was
another
blow
from
a
hostile
world
which
swift
could
never
either
forget
or
forgive
as
the
years
went
on
swift
found
his
position
grow
more
and
more
irksome
at
last
he
began
to
think
of
entering
the
church
as
a
means
of
earning
an
independent
livelihood
and
becoming
his
own
master
and
one
day
having
a
quarrel
with
sir
william
he
left
his
house
in
a
passion
and
went
back
to
ireland
here
after
some
trouble
he
was
made
a
priest
and
received
a
little
seaside
parish
worth
about
a
hundred
pounds
a
year
swift
was
now
his
own
master
but
he
found
it
dull
he
had
so
few
parishioners
that
it
is
said
he
used
to
go
down
to
the
seashore
and
skiff
stones
in
order
to
gather
a
congregation
for
he
thought
if
the
people
would
not
come
to
hear
sermons
they
would
come
at
least
to
stare
at
the
mad
clergyman
and
for
years
he
was
remembered
as
the
mad
clergyman
and
now
because
he
found
his
freedom
dull
and
for
various
other
reasons
when
sir
william
asked
him
to
come
back
he
gladly
came
this
time
he
was
much
happier
as
a
member
of
sir
william
household
than
he
had
been
before
it
was
now
that
swift
wrote
the
two
little
books
which
first
made
him
famous
these
were
the
battle
of
the
books
and
a
tale
of
a
tub
the
battle
of
the
books
rose
out
of
a
silly
quarrel
in
which
sir
william
temple
had
taken
part
as
to
whether
the
ancient
or
the
modern
writers
were
the
best
swift
took
temple
side
and
wrote
to
prove
that
the
ancient
writers
were
best
but
as
it
has
been
said
he
wrote
so
cleverly
that
he
proved
the
opposite
against
his
will
for
nowhere
in
the
writings
of
the
ancients
is
there
anything
so
full
or
humor
and
satire
as
the
battle
of
the
books
swift
imagines
a
real
battle
to
have
taken
place
among
the
books
in
the
king
library
at
james
palace
the
books
leave
the
shelves
some
on
horseback
some
on
foot
and
armed
with
sword
and
spear
throw
themselves
into
the
fray
but
we
are
left
quite
uncertain
as
to
who
gained
the
victory
this
little
book
is
a
satire
and
like
all
swift
famous
satires
is
in
prose
not
in
poetry
in
the
preface
he
says
satire
is
a
sort
of
glass
wherein
beholders
do
generally
discover
everybody
face
but
their
own
which
is
the
chief
reason
for
that
kind
reception
it
meets
with
in
the
world
and
that
so
very
few
are
offended
with
it
it
is
not
a
book
that
you
will
care
to
read
for
a
long
time
for
to
find
it
interesting
you
must
know
both
a
good
deal
about
swift
own
times
and
about
the
books
that
fight
the
battle
you
will
not
care
either
for
a
tale
of
a
tub
and
yet
it
is
the
book
above
all
others
which
one
must
read
and
read
with
understanding
if
one
would
get
even
a
little
knowledge
of
swift
special
genius
it
was
the
book
nevertheless
which
more
than
any
other
stood
in
his
way
in
after
life
a
tale
of
a
tub
like
the
battle
of
the
books
is
a
satire
and
swift
wrote
it
to
show
up
the
abuses
of
the
church
he
tells
the
story
of
three
brothers
peter
martin
and
jack
peter
represents
the
roman
catholic
martin
the
anglican
and
jack
the
presbyterian
church
he
meant
he
says
to
turn
the
laugh
only
against
peter
and
jack
that
may
be
so
but
his
treatment
of
martin
can
not
be
called
reverent
indeed
reverence
was
impossible
to
swift
there
is
much
good
to
be
said
of
him
there
was
a
fierce
righteousness
about
his
spirit
which
made
him
a
better
parish
priest
than
many
a
more
pious
man
he
hated
shams
he
hated
cant
he
hated
bondage
dr
swift
it
was
said
hated
all
fanatics
all
fanatics
hated
dr
swift
but
with
all
his
uprightness
and
breadth
he
was
neither
devout
nor
reverent
orrery
when
sir
william
temple
died
swift
went
back
to
ireland
and
after
a
little
time
he
once
more
received
a
church
living
there
but
here
as
before
his
parish
was
very
small
so
that
sometimes
he
had
only
his
clerk
as
congregation
then
he
would
begin
the
service
with
dearly
beloved
roger
the
scripture
moveth
you
and
me
instead
of
dearly
beloved
brethren
as
the
prayer
book
has
it
sir
william
had
left
swift
some
money
he
had
also
left
some
to
esther
johnson
the
little
girl
swift
used
to
teach
she
had
grown
into
a
beautiful
and
witty
woman
and
now
she
too
with
a
friend
went
to
ireland
and
for
the
rest
of
her
life
lived
there
near
swift
the
strange
friendship
between
these
two
between
esther
johnson
and
swift
is
one
of
the
puzzles
in
swift
life
that
they
loved
each
other
that
they
were
friends
every
one
knows
but
were
they
ever
married
were
they
man
and
wife
that
question
remains
unanswered
esther
is
the
persian
word
for
star
stella
the
latin
swift
called
his
stella
and
as
stella
she
has
become
famous
in
our
literature
for
when
swift
was
away
from
home
he
wrote
letters
to
her
which
we
now
have
under
the
name
of
the
journal
to
stella
here
we
see
the
great
man
in
another
light
here
he
is
no
longer
armed
with
lightning
his
pen
is
no
longer
dipped
in
poison
but
in
friendly
simple
fashion
he
tells
all
that
happens
to
him
day
by
day
he
tells
what
he
thinks
and
what
he
feels
where
and
when
he
dines
when
he
gets
up
and
when
he
goes
to
bed
all
the
gossiping
details
interesting
to
one
who
loves
us
and
whom
we
love
and
with
it
all
we
get
a
picture
of
the
times
in
which
he
lived
of
the
politics
of
the
day
of
the
great
men
he
moved
among
swift
always
addresses
both
stella
and
her
companion
mistress
dingley
and
the
letters
are
everywhere
full
of
tender
childish
nonsense
he
invented
what
he
called
a
little
language
using
all
sorts
of
quaint
and
babyish
words
and
strange
strings
of
capital
letters
for
instance
meaning
my
dears
madam
elderly
or
dear
dingley
and
so
on
throughout
too
we
come
on
little
bits
of
doggerel
rimes
bad
puns
simple
jokes
mixed
up
with
scraps
of
politics
with
threatenings
of
war
with
party
quarrels
with
all
kinds
of
stray
fragments
of
news
which
bring
the
life
of
the
times
vividly
before
us
the
letters
were
never
meant
for
any
one
but
stella
and
mistress
dingley
to
see
and
sometimes
when
we
are
reading
the
affectionate
nonsense
we
feel
as
if
no
one
ought
to
have
seen
it
but
these
two
and
yet
it
gives
us
one
whole
side
of
swift
that
we
should
never
have
known
but
for
it
it
is
not
easy
to
give
an
idea
of
this
book
it
must
be
read
to
be
understood
but
i
will
give
you
a
few
extracts
from
it
pshaw
i
must
be
writing
to
those
dear
saucy
brats
every
night
whether
i
will
or
no
let
me
have
what
business
i
will
or
come
home
ever
so
late
or
be
ever
so
sleepy
but
an
old
saying
and
a
true
one
you
lords
or
be
you
earls
you
must
write
to
saucy
girls
i
was
at
court
and
saw
raymond
among
the
beefeaters
staying
to
see
the
queen
so
i
put
him
in
a
better
station
made
two
or
three
dozen
of
bows
and
went
to
church
and
then
to
court
again
to
pick
up
a
dinner
as
i
did
with
sir
john
stanley
and
then
we
went
to
visit
lord
mountjoy
and
just
now
left
him
and
near
eleven
at
night
young
women
or
again
the
queen
was
abroad
in
order
to
hunt
but
finding
it
disposed
to
rain
she
kept
in
her
coach
she
hunts
in
a
chaise
with
one
horse
which
she
drives
herself
and
drives
furiously
like
jehu
and
is
a
mighty
hunter
like
nimrod
dingley
has
heard
of
nimrod
but
not
stella
for
it
is
in
the
bible
the
queen
and
i
were
going
to
take
the
air
this
afternoon
but
not
together
and
were
both
hindered
by
a
sudden
rain
her
coaches
and
chaises
all
went
back
and
the
guards
too
and
i
scoured
into
the
marketplace
for
shelter

day

yours
is
only
an
s
too
much
chapter
lxiv
swift
gulliver
travels
during
the
years
in
which
swift
found
time
to
write
these
playful
letters
to
stella
he
was
growing
into
a
man
of
power
like
defoe
he
was
a
journalist
but
one
of
far
more
authority
the
power
of
his
pen
was
such
that
he
was
courted
by
his
friends
feared
by
his
enemies
he
threw
himself
into
the
struggle
of
party
first
as
a
whig
then
as
a
tory
but
as
a
friend
said
of
him
later
he
was
neither
whig
nor
tory
neither
jacobite
nor
republican
he
was
dr
swift
he
was
now
he
says
orrery
grown
old
in
politicks
and
wit
caress
by
ministers
of
state
of
half
mankind
the
dread
and
hate
and
vanessa
and
he
felt
that
he
deserved
reward
for
what
he
had
done
for
his
party
he
thought
that
he
should
have
been
made
a
bishop
but
even
in
those
days
when
little
thought
was
given
to
the
fitness
of
a
man
for
such
a
position
the
queen
steadily
refused
to
make
the
author
of
a
tale
of
a
tub
a
bishop
again
swift
felt
that
he
was
unjustly
treated
and
even
when
he
was
at
length
made
dean
of
patrick
that
consoled
him
little
he
longed
for
power
and
owned
that
he
was
never
so
happy
as
when
treated
like
a
lord
he
longed
for
wealth
for
wealth
he
said
is
liberty
and
liberty
is
a
blessing
fittest
for
a
philosopher
and
if
swift
was
displeased
at
being
made
only
a
dean
the
irish
people
were
equally
displeased
with
him
as
their
dean
as
he
rode
through
the
streets
of
dublin
to
take
possession
of
his
deanery
the
people
threw
stones
and
mud
at
him
and
hooted
him
as
he
passed
the
clergy
too
made
his
work
as
dean
as
hard
as
possible
but
swift
set
himself
to
conquer
them
and
soon
he
had
his
own
way
even
in
trifles
we
can
not
follow
swift
through
all
his
political
adventures
and
writings
in
those
days
the
misgovernment
of
ireland
was
terrible
and
swift
although
he
loved
neither
ireland
nor
the
irish
fought
for
their
rights
until
from
being
hated
by
them
he
became
the
idol
of
the
people
and
those
who
had
thrown
mud
and
stones
now
cheered
him
as
he
passed
wherever
he
went
he
was
received
with
honor
his
birthday
was
kept
as
a
day
of
rejoicing
by
irishmen
with
gratitude
but
even
in
his
hour
of
triumph
swift
was
a
lonely
and
discontented
man
as
we
may
learn
from
his
letters
it
was
now
that
he
published
the
book
upon
which
his
fame
most
surely
rests
gulliver
travels
it
is
a
book
which
has
given
pleasure
to
numberless
people
ever
since
yet
swift
said
himself
the
chief
end
i
propose
to
myself
in
all
my
labours
is
to
vex
the
world
rather
than
divert
it
and
if
i
could
compass
that
design
without
hurting
my
own
person
or
fortune
i
would
be
the
most
indefatigable
writer
you
have
ever
seen
i
hate
and
detest
that
animal
called
man
although
i
heartily
love
john
peter
thomas
and
so
forth
upon
this
great
foundation
of
misanthropy
the
whole
building
of
my
travels
is
erected
but
whether
swift
at
the
time
vexed
the
world
with
gulliver
or
not
ever
since
he
has
succeeded
in
diverting
it
travels
is
an
allegory
and
a
satire
but
there
is
no
need
now
to
do
more
than
enjoy
it
as
a
story
the
story
is
divided
into
four
parts
in
the
first
captain
lemuel
gulliver
being
wrecked
finds
himself
upon
an
island
where
all
the
people
are
so
small
that
he
can
pick
them
up
in
his
thumb
and
finger
and
it
requires
six
hundred
of
their
beds
to
make
one
for
him
in
the
second
part
gulliver
comes
to
a
country
where
the
people
are
giants
they
are
so
large
that
they
in
their
turn
can
lift
gulliver
up
between
thumb
and
finger
in
the
third
voyage
gulliver
is
taken
by
pirates
and
at
last
lands
upon
a
flying
island
and
from
there
he
passes
on
to
other
wonderful
places
in
the
fourth
his
men
mutiny
and
put
him
ashore
on
an
unknown
land
there
he
finds
that
horses
are
the
rulers
and
a
terrible
kind
of
degraded
human
being
their
slaves
and
servants
in
the
last
part
the
satire
is
too
bitter
the
degradation
of
man
too
terribly
insisted
upon
to
make
it
pleasant
reading
and
altogether
the
first
two
stories
are
the
most
interesting
here
is
how
swift
tells
us
of
gulliver
arrival
in
lilliput
the
country
of
the
tiny
folk
after
the
shipwreck
and
a
long
battle
with
the
waves
he
has
at
length
reached
land
i
lay
down
on
the
grass
which
was
very
short
and
soft
where
i
slept
sounder
than
ever
i
remember
to
have
done
in
my
life
and
as
i
reckoned
about
nine
hours
for
when
i
awaked
it
was
just
daylight
i
attempted
to
rise
but
was
not
able
to
stir
for
as
i
happened
to
lie
on
my
back
i
found
my
arms
and
legs
were
strongly
fastened
on
each
side
to
the
ground
and
my
hair
which
was
long
and
thick
tied
down
in
the
same
manner
i
could
only
look
upwards
the
sun
began
to
grow
hot
and
the
light
offended
my
eyes
i
heard
a
confused
noise
about
me
but
in
the
posture
i
lay
could
see
nothing
except
the
sky
in
a
little
time
i
felt
something
alive
moving
on
my
left
leg
which
advancing
gently
forward
over
my
breast
came
almost
up
to
my
chin
when
bending
my
eyes
downwards
as
much
as
i
could
i
perceived
it
to
be
a
human
creature
not
six
inches
high
with
a
bow
and
arrow
in
his
hands
and
a
quiver
at
his
back
in
the
meantime
i
felt
at
least
fifty
more
of
the
same
kind
as
i
conjectured
following
the
first
i
was
in
the
utmost
astonishment
and
roared
so
loud
that
they
all
ran
back
in
a
fright
and
some
of
them
as
i
was
afterwards
told
were
hurt
with
the
falls
they
got
by
leaping
from
my
sides
upon
the
ground
however
they
soon
returned
and
one
of
them
who
ventured
so
far
as
to
get
a
full
sight
of
my
face
lifting
up
his
hands
and
eyes
by
way
of
admiration
cried
out
in
a
shrill
but
distinct
voice
hekinah
degul
the
others
repeated
the
same
words
several
times
but
then
i
knew
not
what
they
meant
i
lay
all
this
while
as
the
reader
may
believe
in
great
uneasiness
at
length
struggling
to
get
loose
i
had
the
fortune
to
break
the
strings
and
wrench
out
the
pegs
that
fastened
my
left
arm
to
the
ground
for
by
lifting
it
up
to
my
face
i
discovered
the
methods
they
had
taken
to
bind
me
and
at
the
same
time
with
a
violent
pull
which
game
me
excessive
pain
i
a
little
loosened
the
strings
that
tied
down
my
hair
on
the
left
side
so
that
i
was
just
able
to
turn
my
head
about
two
inches
but
the
creatures
ran
off
a
second
time
before
i
could
seize
them
whereupon
there
was
a
great
shout
in
a
very
shrill
accent
and
after
it
ceased
i
heard
one
of
them
cry
aloud
tolgo
phonac
when
in
an
instant
i
felt
above
an
hundred
arrows
discharged
on
my
left
hand
which
pricked
me
like
so
many
needles
and
besides
they
shot
another
flight
into
the
air
as
we
do
bombs
in
europe
whereof
many
i
suppose
fell
on
my
body
though
i
felt
them
not
and
some
on
my
face
which
i
immediately
covered
with
my
left
hand
when
this
shower
of
arrows
was
over
i
fell
with
grief
and
pain
and
then
striving
again
to
get
loose
they
discharged
another
volley
larger
than
the
first
and
some
of
them
attempted
with
spears
to
stick
me
in
the
sides
but
by
good
luck
i
had
on
a
buff
jerkin
which
they
could
not
pierce
gulliver
decided
that
the
best
thing
he
could
do
was
to
lie
still
until
night
came
and
then
having
his
left
hand
already
loose
he
would
soon
be
able
to
free
himself
however
he
did
not
need
to
wait
so
long
for
very
soon
by
orders
of
a
mannikin
who
seemed
to
have
great
authority
over
the
others
his
head
was
set
free
the
little
man
then
made
a
long
speech
not
a
word
of
which
gulliver
understood
but
he
replied
meekly
showing
by
signs
that
he
had
no
wicked
intentions
against
the
tiny
folk
and
that
he
was
also
very
hungry
the
hurgo
for
so
they
call
a
great
lord
as
i
afterwards
learnt
understood
me
very
well
he
commanded
that
several
ladders
should
be
applied
to
my
sides
on
which
above
an
hundred
of
the
inhabitants
mounted
and
walked
towards
my
mouth
laden
with
baskets
full
of
meat
which
had
been
provided
and
sent
thither
by
the
king
orders
upon
the
first
intelligence
he
received
of
me
i
observed
there
was
the
flesh
of
several
animals
but
could
not
distinguish
them
by
the
taste
there
were
shoulders
legs
and
loins
shaped
like
those
of
mutton
and
very
well
dressed
but
smaller
than
the
wings
of
a
lark
i
ate
them
by
two
or
three
at
a
mouthful
and
took
three
loaves
at
a
time
about
the
bigness
of
musket
bullets
they
supplied
me
as
fast
as
they
could
showing
a
thousand
marks
of
wonder
and
astonishment
at
my
bulk
and
appetite
i
then
made
another
sign
that
i
wanted
to
drink
they
found
by
my
eating
that
a
small
quantity
would
not
suffice
me
and
being
a
most
ingenious
people
they
slung
up
with
great
dexterity
one
of
their
largest
hogsheads
then
rolled
it
towards
my
hand
and
beat
out
the
top
i
drank
it
off
at
a
draught
which
i
might
well
do
for
it
did
not
hold
half
a
pint
and
tasted
like
a
small
wine
of
burgundy
but
much
more
delicious
they
brought
me
a
second
hogshead
which
i
drank
in
the
same
manner
and
made
signs
for
more
but
they
had
none
to
give
me
when
i
had
performed
these
wonders
they
shouted
for
joy
and
danced
upon
my
breast
repeating
several
times
as
they
did
at
first
hekinah
degul
and
now
having
introduced
you
and
gulliver
to
the
lilliputians
i
must
leave
you
to
hear
about
his
further
adventures
among
them
from
the
book
itself
there
you
will
learn
how
gulliver
received
his
freedom
and
how
he
lived
happily
among
the
little
people
until
at
length
swift
falls
upon
the
quaint
idea
of
having
him
impeached
for
treason
gulliver
then
hearing
of
this
danger
escapes
and
after
a
few
more
adventures
arrives
at
home
as
a
contrast
to
what
you
have
just
read
you
may
like
to
hear
of
gulliver
first
adventures
in
brobdingnag
the
land
of
giants
gulliver
had
been
found
by
a
farmer
and
carried
home
when
the
farmer
wife
first
saw
him
she
screamed
and
ran
back
as
women
in
england
do
at
the
sight
of
a
toad
or
a
spider
however
when
she
saw
that
he
was
only
a
tiny
man
she
soon
grew
fond
of
him
it
was
about
twelve
at
noon
and
a
servant
brought
in
dinner
it
was
only
one
substantial
dish
of
meat
fit
for
the
plain
condition
of
a
husbandman
in
a
dish
of
about
foot
diameter
the
company
were
the
farmer
and
his
wife
three
children
and
an
old
when
they
were
sat
down
the
farmer
placed
me
at
some
distance
from
him
on
the
table
which
was
thirty
foot
high
from
the
floor
i
was
in
a
terrible
fright
and
kept
as
far
as
i
could
from
the
edge
for
fear
of
falling
the
wife
minced
a
bit
of
meat
then
crumbled
some
bread
on
a
trencher
and
placed
it
before
me
i
made
her
a
low
bow
took
out
my
knife
and
fork
and
fell
to
eat
which
gave
them
exceeding
delight
the
mistress
sent
her
maid
for
a
small
dram
cup
which
held
about
two
gallons
and
filled
it
with
drink
i
took
up
the
vessel
with
much
difficulty
in
both
hands
and
in
a
most
respectful
manner
drank
to
her
ladyship
health
expressing
the
words
as
loud
as
i
could
in
english
which
made
the
company
laugh
so
heartily
that
i
was
almost
deafened
with
the
noise
in
the
midst
of
dinner
my
mistress
favourite
cat
leapt
into
her
lap
i
heard
a
noise
behind
me
like
that
of
a
dozen
at
work
and
turning
my
head
i
found
it
proceeded
from
the
purring
of
this
animal
who
seemed
to
be
three
times
larger
than
an
ox
as
i
computed
by
the
view
of
her
head
and
one
of
her
paws
while
her
mistress
was
feeding
and
stroking
her
the
fierceness
of
this
creature
countenance
altogether
discomposed
me
though
i
stood
at
the
further
end
of
the
table
above
fifty
foot
off
and
although
my
mistress
held
her
fast
for
fear
she
might
give
a
spring
and
seize
me
in
her
talons
but
it
happened
there
was
no
danger
for
the
cat
took
not
the
least
notice
of
me
when
my
master
placed
me
within
three
yards
of
her
and
as
i
have
been
always
told
and
found
true
by
experience
in
my
travels
that
flying
or
discovering
fear
before
a
fierce
animal
is
a
certain
way
to
make
it
pursue
or
attack
you
so
i
resolved
in
this
dangerous
juncture
to
show
no
manner
of
concern
i
walked
with
intrepidity
five
or
six
times
before
the
very
head
of
the
cat
and
came
within
half
a
yard
of
her
whereupon
she
drew
herself
back
as
if
she
were
more
afraid
of
me
when
it
was
published
gulliver
travels
was
at
once
a
great
success
ten
days
after
it
appeared
two
poets
wrote
to
swift
that
the
whole
town
men
women
and
children
are
quite
full
of
it
for
nearly
twenty
years
longer
swift
lived
then
sad
to
say
the
life
of
the
man
who
wrote
for
us
these
fascinating
tales
closed
in
gloom
without
relief
stella
his
friend
died
that
left
him
forlorn
and
desolate
then
as
the
years
passed
darker
and
darker
gloom
settled
upon
his
spirit
disease
crept
over
both
mind
and
body
he
was
tortured
by
pain
and
when
at
length
the
pain
left
him
he
sank
into
torpor
it
was
not
madness
that
had
come
upon
him
but
a
dumb
stupor
for
more
than
two
years
he
lived
but
it
was
a
living
death
without
memory
without
hope
the
great
genius
had
become
the
voiceless
ruin
of
a
man
but
at
length
a
merciful
end
came
on
an
october
day
in
swift
died
he
who
had
torn
his
own
heard
with
restless
bitterness
who
had
suffered
and
caused
others
to
suffer
had
at
last
found
rest
he
was
buried
at
dead
of
night
in
his
own
cathedral
and
laid
by
stella
side
and
over
his
grave
were
carved
words
chosen
by
himself
which
told
the
wayfarer
that
jonathan
swift
had
gone
where
savage
indignation
can
no
longer
tear
at
his
heart
go
wayfarer
and
imitate

thou

on

perhaps
a

joseph
addison
was
the
son
of
a
dean
he
was
born
in
in
the
quaint
little
thatched
parsonage
of
milston
a
wiltshire
village
not
far
from
that
strange
monument
of
ancient
days
stonehenge
when
he
was
old
enough
joseph
was
sent
first
to
schools
near
his
home
and
then
a
little
later
to
the
famous
charterhouse
in
london
of
his
schooldays
we
know
little
but
we
can
guess
for
one
story
that
has
come
down
to
us
that
he
was
a
shy
nervous
boy
it
is
said
that
once
having
done
something
a
little
wrong
he
was
so
afraid
of
what
punishment
might
follow
that
he
ran
away
he
hid
in
a
wood
sleeping
in
a
hollow
tree
and
feeding
on
wild
berries
until
he
was
found
and
taken
home
to
his
parents
at
charterhouse
joseph
met
another
boy
named
dick
steele
and
these
two
became
fast
friends
although
they
were
very
different
from
each
other
for
dick
was
merry
noisy
and
and
although
joseph
loved
fun
too
it
was
in
a
quiet
shy
way
dick
who
was
a
few
weeks
older
than
joseph
was
the
son
of
a
do
lawyer
he
was
born
in
ireland
but
did
not
remain
there
long
for
as
both
his
father
and
mother
died
when
he
was
still
a
little
boy
he
was
brought
to
england
to
be
taken
care
of
by
an
uncle
from
charterhouse
joseph
and
dick
both
went
to
oxford
but
to
different
colleges
dick
left
the
university
without
taking
his
degree
and
became
a
soldier
while
joseph
stayed
many
years
and
became
a
man
of
learning
joseph
addison
had
gone
to
college
with
the
idea
of
becoming
a
clergyman
like
his
father
but
after
a
time
he
gave
up
that
idea
and
turned
his
thoughts
to
politics
the
politicians
of
the
day
were
always
on
the
lookout
for
clever
men
who
by
their
writings
would
help
to
sway
the
people
to
their
way
of
thinking
already
at
college
addison
had
become
known
by
his
latin
poetry
and
three
whig
statesmen
thought
so
highly
of
it
that
they
offered
him
a
pension
of
pounds
a
year
to
allow
him
to
travel
on
the
continent
and
learn
french
and
so
add
to
his
learning
as
to
be
able
to
help
their
side
by
his
writing
addison
accepted
the
pension
and
set
out
on
his
travels
for
four
years
he
wandered
about
the
continent
adding
to
his
store
of
knowledge
of
men
and
books
meeting
many
of
the
foremost
men
of
letters
of
his
day
but
long
before
he
returned
home
his
friends
had
fallen
from
power
and
his
pension
was
stopped
so
back
in
london
we
find
him
cheerfully
betaking
himself
to
a
poor
lodging
up
three
flights
of
stairs
hoping
for
something
to
turn
up
these
were
the
days
of
the
war
of
the
spanish
succession
and
of
the
brilliant
victories
of
marlborough
of
which
you
have
read
in
the
history
of
the
time
of
anne
blenheim
had
been
fought
all
england
was
ringing
with
the
praises
of
the
great
general
in
prose
and
verse
but
the
verse
was
poor
and
it
seemed
to
those
in
power
that
this
great
victory
ought
to
be
celebrated
more
worthily
so
the
lord
treasurer
looked
about
him
for
some
one
who
could
sing
of
it
in
fitting
fashion
the
right
person
however
seemed
hard
to
find
and
the
laureate
of
the
day
an
honest
gentleman
named
nahum
tate
who
could
hardly
be
called
a
poet
was
quite
unable
for
the
task
to
help
the
lord
treasurer
out
of
his
difficulty
one
of
the
great
men
who
had
already
befriended
addison
suggested
him
as
a
suitable
writer
and
so
one
morning
addison
was
surprised
in
his
little
garret
by
a
visit
from
no
less
a
person
than
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
a
shy
boy
at
school
addison
had
grown
into
a
shy
retiring
man
and
no
doubt
he
was
not
a
little
taken
aback
at
a
visit
from
so
great
a
personage
the
chancellor
however
soon
put
him
at
his
ease
told
him
what
he
had
come
about
and
begged
him
to
undertake
the
work
in
short
the
chancellor
said
so
many
obliging
things
and
in
so
graceful
a
manner
as
gave
addison
the
utmost
spirit
and
encouragement
to
begin
that
poem
which
he
afterwards
published
and
entitled
the
campaign
memories
of
the
boyles
the
poem
was
a
great
success
and
besides
being
paid
for
the
work
addison
received
a
government
post
so
once
more
life
ran
smoothly
for
him
he
had
now
both
money
and
leisure
his
government
duties
left
him
time
to
write
and
in
the
next
few
years
he
published
a
delightful
book
of
his
travels
and
an
opera
shy
humorous
courteous
addison
steadily
grew
popular
everything
went
well
with
him
if
he
had
a
mind
to
be
chosen
king
he
would
hardly
be
refused
said
swift
he
however
only
became
a
member
of
parliament
but
he
was
too
shy
ever
to
make
a
speech
and
presently
he
went
to
ireland
as
secretary
of
state
swift
and
addison
already
knew
each
other
and
addison
had
sent
a
copy
of
his
travels
to
swift
as
to
the
most
agreeable
companion
the
truest
friend
and
the
greatest
genius
of
his
age
now
in
ireland
they
saw
much
of
each
other
and
although
they
were
as
swift
himself
says
as
different
as
black
and
white
they
became
fast
friends
and
even
later
in
those
days
of
bitter
party
feeling
when
swift
left
his
own
side
and
became
a
tory
though
their
friendship
cooled
they
never
became
enemies
bitter
pen
was
never
turned
against
his
old
friend
addison
with
all
his
humor
and
his
satire
never
attacked
any
man
personally
so
their
relations
continued
friendly
and
courteous
to
the
end
in
the
journal
to
stella
we
find
many
entries
about
this
difficulty
between
the
friends
addison
and
i
are
as
different
as
black
and
white
and
i
believe
our
friendship
will
go
off
by
this
business
of
party
but
i
love
him
still
as
much
as
ever
though
we
seldom
meet
all
our
friendship
and
dearness
are
off
we
are
civil
acquaintance
talk
words
of
course
of
when
we
shall
meet
and
that
all
is
it
not
odd
then
later
the
first
bitterness
of
difference
seems
to
pass
and
swift
tells
how
he
went
to
addison
for
supper
we
were
very
good
company
and
i
yet
know
no
man
half
so
agreeable
to
me
as
he
is
it
was
while
addison
was
in
ireland
that
richard
steele
started
a
paper
called
the
tatler
when
addison
found
out
that
it
was
his
old
friend
dick
who
had
started
the
tatler
he
offered
to
help
and
he
helped
to
such
good
purpose
that
steele
says
i
fared
like
a
distressed
prince
who
calls
in
a
powerful
neighbour
to
his
aid
i
was
undone
by
my
own
auxiliary
when
i
had
once
called
him
in
i
could
not
subsist
without
dependence
on
him
this
was
the
beginning
of
a
long
literary
partnership
that
has
become
famous
never
perhaps
were
two
friends
more
different
in
character
yet
says
steele
long
after
speaking
of
himself
and
addison
there
never
was
a
more
strict
friendship
than
between
those
gentlemen
nor
had
they
ever
any
difference
but
what
proceeded
from
their
different
way
of
pursuing
the
same
thing
the
one
with
patience
foresight
and
temperate
address
always
waited
and
stemmed
the
torrent
while
the
other
often
plunged
himself
into
it
and
was
as
often
taken
out
by
the
temper
of
him
who
stood
weeping
on
the
brink
for
his
safety
whom
he
could
not
dissuade
from
leaping
into
it
when
they
met
they
were
as
unreserved
as
boys
and
talked
of
the
greatest
affairs
upon
which
they
saw
where
they
differed
without
pressing
what
they
knew
impossible
to
convert
each
other
in
the
theatre
the
tatler
like
defoe
review
was
a
leaflet
of
two
or
three
pages
published
three
times
a
week
the
review
and
other
papers
of
the
same
kind
no
doubt
prepared
the
way
for
the
tatler
but
the
latter
was
written
with
far
greater
genius
and
while
the
review
is
almost
forgotten
the
tatler
is
still
remembered
and
still
read
in
the
first
number
steele
announced
that
all
accounts
of
gallantry
pleasure
and
entertainment
shall
be
under
the
article
of
white
poetry
under
that
of
wills
house
learning
under
the
title
of
grecian
foreign
and
domestic
news
you
will
have
from
saint
james
and
what
else
i
have
to
offer
on
any
other
subject
shall
be
dated
from
my
own
apartment
the
and
were
the
clubs
of
the
day
it
was
there
the
wits
gathered
together
to
talk
just
as
in
the
days
of
ben
jonson
they
gathered
at
the
mermaid
tavern
and
in
these
still
nearly
newspaperless
days
it
was
in
the
that
the
latest
news
whether
of
politics
or
literature
or
sheer
gossip
was
heard
and
discussed
at
one
chiefly
statesmen
and
politicians
would
gather
at
another
poets
and
wits
and
so
on
so
steele
dated
each
article
from
the
house
at
which
the
subject
of
it
would
most
naturally
be
discussed
steele
meant
the
tatler
to
be
a
newspaper
in
which
one
might
find
all
the
news
of
the
day
but
he
also
meant
it
to
be
something
more
you
have
heard
that
after
the
restoration
many
of
the
books
that
were
written
and
plays
that
were
acted
were
coarse
and
wicked
and
the
people
who
read
these
books
and
watched
these
plays
led
coarse
and
wicked
lives
and
now
a
rollicking
soldier
noisy
dick
steele
a
rake
among
scholars
and
a
scholar
among
rakes
made
up
his
mind
to
try
to
make
things
better
and
give
people
something
sweet
and
clean
to
read
daily
the
tatler
especially
after
addison
joined
with
steele
in
producing
it
was
a
great
success
but
as
time
went
on
although
it
continued
to
be
a
newspaper
gradually
more
room
was
given
to
fiction
than
to
fact
and
to
essays
on
all
manner
of
subjects
than
to
the
news
of
the
day
for
addison
is
among
the
greatest
of
our
essayists
but
although
these
essays
were
often
meant
to
teach
something
neither
steele
nor
addison
are
always
trying
to
be
moral
or
enforce
a
lesson
at
times
the
papers
fairly
bubble
with
fun
one
of
the
best
humorous
articles
in
the
tatler
is
one
in
which
addison
gives
a
pretended
newly
found
story
by
our
friend
sir
john
mandeville
it
is
perhaps
as
delightful
a
lying
tale
as
any
that
learned
and
worthy
knight
ever
invented
here
is
a
part
of
it
we
were
separated
by
a
storm
in
the
latitude
of
insomuch
that
only
the
ship
which
i
was
in
with
a
dutch
and
french
vessel
got
safe
into
a
creek
of
nova
zembla
we
landed
in
order
to
refit
our
vessels
and
store
ourselves
with
provisions
the
crew
of
each
vessel
made
themselves
a
cabin
of
turf
and
wood
at
some
distance
from
each
other
to
fence
themselves
against
the
inclemencies
of
the
weather
which
was
severe
beyond
imagination
we
soon
observed
that
in
talking
to
one
another
we
lost
several
of
our
words
and
could
not
hear
one
another
at
above
two
distance
and
that
too
when
we
sat
very
near
the
fire
after
much
perplexity
i
found
that
our
words
froze
in
the
air
before
they
could
reach
the
ears
of
the
persons
to
whom
they
were
spoken
i
was
soon
confirmed
in
this
conjecture
when
upon
the
increase
of
the
cold
the
whole
company
grew
dumb
or
rather
deaf
for
every
man
was
sensible
as
we
afterwards
found
that
he
spoke
as
well
as
ever
but
the
sounds
no
sooner
took
air
than
they
were
condensed
and
lost
it
was
now
a
miserable
spectacle
to
see
us
nodding
and
gaping
at
one
another
every
man
talking
and
no
man
heard
one
might
observe
a
seaman
that
could
hail
a
ship
at
a
league
distance
beckoning
with
his
hands
straining
his
lungs
and
tearing
his
throat
but
all
in
vain
we
continued
here
three
weeks
in
this
dismal
plight
at
length
upon
a
turn
of
wind
the
air
about
us
began
to
thaw
our
cabin
was
immediately
filled
with
a
dry
clattering
sound
which
i
afterwards
found
to
be
the
crackling
of
consonants
that
broke
above
our
heads
and
were
often
mixed
with
a
gentle
hissing
which
i
imputed
to
the
letter
s
that
occurs
so
frequently
in
the
english
tongue
i
soon
after
felt
a
breeze
of
whispers
rushing
by
my
ear
for
those
being
of
a
soft
and
gentle
substance
immediately
liquified
in
the
warm
wind
that
blew
across
our
cabin
these
were
soon
followed
by
syllables
and
short
words
and
at
length
by
entire
sentences
that
melted
sooner
or
later
as
they
were
more
or
less
congealed
so
that
we
now
heard
everything
that
had
been
spoken
during
the
whole
three
weeks
that
we
had
been
silent
if
i
may
use
that
expression
it
was
now
very
early
in
the
morning
and
yet
to
my
surprise
i
heard
somebody
say
john
it
is
midnight
and
time
for
the
ship
crew
to
go
to
bed
this
i
knew
to
be
the
pilot
voice
and
upon
recollecting
myself
i
concluded
that
he
had
spoken
these
words
to
me
some
days
before
though
i
could
not
hear
them
before
the
present
thaw
my
reader
will
easily
imagine
how
the
whole
crew
was
amazed
to
hear
every
man
talking
and
seeing
no
man
opening
his
mouth
when
the
confusion
of
voices
was
pretty
well
over
sir
john
proposed
a
visit
to
the
dutch
cabin
and
so
they
set
out
at
about
half
a
mile
distance
from
our
cabin
we
heard
the
groanings
of
a
bear
which
at
first
startled
us
but
upon
inquiry
we
were
informed
by
some
of
our
company
that
he
was
dead
and
now
lay
in
salt
having
been
killed
upon
that
very
spot
about
a
fortnight
before
in
the
time
of
the
frost
having
reached
the
dutch
cabin
the
company
was
almost
stunned
by
the
confusion
of
sounds
and
could
not
make
out
a
word
for
about
half
an
hour
this
sir
john
thinks
was
because
the
dutch
language
being
so
much
harsher
than
ours
it
wanted
more
time
than
ours
to
melt
and
become
audible
next
they
visited
the
french
cabin
and
here
sir
john
says
i
was
convinced
of
an
error
into
which
i
had
before
fallen
for
i
had
fancied
that
for
the
freezing
of
the
sound
it
was
necessary
for
it
to
be
wrapped
up
and
as
it
were
preserved
in
breath
but
i
found
my
mistake
when
i
heard
the
sound
of
a
kit
playing
a
minuet
over
our
heads
the
kit
was
a
small
violin
to
the
sound
of
which
the
frenchmen
had
danced
to
amuse
themselves
while
they
were
deaf
or
dumb
how
it
was
that
the
kit
could
be
heard
during
the
frost
and
yet
still
be
heard
in
the
thaw
we
are
not
told
sir
john
gave
very
good
reasons
says
addison
but
as
they
are
somewhat
long
i
pass
over
them
in
silence
addison
and
steele
carried
on
the
tatler
for
two
years
then
it
was
stopped
to
make
way
for
a
far
more
famous
paper
called
the
spectator
but
meanwhile
the
whigs
fell
from
power
and
addison
lost
his
government
post
in
twelve
months
he
said
to
a
friend
he
lost
a
place
worth
two
thousand
pounds
a
year
an
estate
in
the
indies
and
worst
of
all
his
who
the
was
is
not
known
but
doubtless
she
was
some
great
lady
ready
enough
to
marry
a
secretary
of
state
but
not
a
poor
scribbler
as
addison
had
now
no
government
post
it
left
him
all
the
more
time
for
writing
and
his
essays
in
the
spectator
are
what
we
chiefly
remember
him
by
the
spectator
was
still
further
from
the
ordinary
newspaper
than
the
tatler
it
was
more
perhaps
what
our
modern
magazines
are
meant
to
be
but
instead
of
being
published
once
a
week
or
once
a
month
it
was
published
every
morning
in
order
to
give
interest
to
the
paper
instead
of
dating
the
articles
from
various
as
had
been
done
in
the
tatler
addison
and
steele
between
them
imagined
a
club
and
it
is
the
doings
of
these
members
their
characters
and
their
lives
which
supply
subjects
for
many
of
the
articles
in
the
first
numbers
of
the
spectator
these
members
are
described
to
us
first
of
all
there
is
the
spectator
himself
he
is
the
editor
of
the
paper
it
is
he
who
with
kindly
humorous
smile
and
grave
twinkle
in
his
eye
is
to
be
seen
everywhere
he
is
seen
and
he
sees
and
listens
but
seldom
opens
his
lips
in
short
he
says
i
have
acted
in
all
the
parts
of
my
life
as
a
and
that
is
the
meaning
of
spectator
the
this
looker
there
can
be
little
doubt
was
meant
to
be
a
picture
of
addison
himself
in
a
later
paper
he
tells
us
that
he
was
a
man
of
a
very
short
face
extremely
addicted
to
silence
and
was
a
great
humorist
in
all
parts
of
his
life
and
when
you
come
to
know
spectator
well
i
think
you
will
love
this
grave
humorist
after
spectator
the
chief
member
of
the
club
was
sir
roger
de
coverley
his
was
inventor
of
that
famous
country
dance
which
is
called
after
him
all
who
know
that
shire
in
which
he
lives
are
very
well
acquainted
with
the
parts
and
merits
of
sir
roger
he
is
a
gentleman
that
is
very
singular
in
his
behaviour
but
his
singularities
proceed
from
his
good
sense
and
are
contradictions
to
the
manners
of
the
world
only
as
he
thinks
the
world
is
in
the
wrong
he
was
careless
of
fashion
in
dress
and
wore
a
coat
and
doublet
which
he
used
laughingly
to
say
had
been
in
and
out
twelve
times
since
he
first
wore
it
he
is
now
in
his
year
cheerful
gay
and
hearty
keeps
a
good
house
both
in
town
and
country
a
great
lover
of
mankind
but
there
is
such
a
mirthful
cast
in
his
behaviour
that
he
is
rather
beloved
than
esteemed
his
tenants
grow
rich
his
servants
look
satisfied
all
the
young
women
profess
love
to
him
and
the
young
men
are
glad
of
his
company
when
he
comes
into
a
house
he
calls
the
servants
by
their
names
and
talks
all
the
way
upstairs
to
a
visit
next
came
a
lawyer
of
the
inner
temple
who
had
become
a
lawyer
not
because
he
wanted
to
be
one
but
because
he
wanted
to
please
his
old
father
he
had
been
sent
to
london
to
study
the
laws
of
the
land
but
he
liked
much
better
to
study
those
of
the
stage
he
is
an
excellent
critic
and
the
time
of
the
play
is
his
hour
of
business
exactly
at
five
he
passes
through
new
inn
crosses
through
russel
court
and
takes
a
turn
at
wills
till
the
play
begins
he
has
his
shoes
rubbed
and
his
periwig
powdered
at
the
barber
as
you
go
into
the
rose
next
comes
sir
andrew
freeport
a
merchant
of
great
eminence
in
the
city
of
london
he
abounds
in
several
frugal
maxims
amongst
which
the
greatest
favorite
is
penny
saved
is
a
penny
got
next
to
sir
andrew
in
the
club
room
sits
captain
sentry
a
gentleman
of
great
courage
good
understanding
but
invincible
modesty
he
was
some
years
a
captain
and
behaved
himself
with
great
gallantry
in
several
engagements
and
at
several
sieges
but
having
a
small
estate
of
his
own
and
being
next
heir
to
sir
roger
he
has
quitted
a
way
of
life
in
which
no
man
can
rise
suitably
to
his
merit
who
is
not
something
of
a
courtier
as
well
as
a
soldier
the
military
part
of
his
life
has
furnished
him
with
many
adventures
in
the
relation
of
which
he
is
very
agreeable
to
the
company
for
he
is
never
overbearing
though
accustomed
to
command
men
in
the
utmost
degree
below
him
nor
ever
too
obsequious
from
an
habit
of
obeying
men
highly
above
him
but
that
our
society
may
not
appear
a
set
of
humorists
unacquainted
with
the
gallantries
and
pleasures
of
the
age
we
have
among
us
the
gallant
will
honeycomb
a
gentleman
who
according
to
his
years
should
be
in
the
decline
of
his
life
but
having
ever
been
very
careful
of
his
person
and
always
had
a
very
easy
fortune
time
has
made
but
very
little
impression
either
by
wrinkles
on
his
forehead
or
traces
in
his
brain
his
person
is
well
turned
of
a
good
height
he
is
very
ready
at
that
sort
of
discourse
with
which
men
usually
entertain
women
he
has
all
his
life
dressed
very
well
and
remembers
habits
as
other
do
men
he
can
smile
when
one
speaks
to
him
and
laugh
easily
he
is
in
fact
an
old
beau
a
regular
man
about
town
a
fine
gentleman
yet
no
great
scholar
he
spelt
like
a
gentleman
and
not
like
a
scholar
he
says
last
of
all
there
is
a
clergyman
a
man
of
general
learning
great
sanctity
of
life
and
the
most
exact
breeding
he
seldom
comes
to
the
club
but
when
he
does
it
adds
to
every
man
else
a
new
enjoyment
of
himself
this
setting
forth
of
the
characters
in
the
story
will
remind
you
a
little
perhaps
of
chaucer
in
his
prologue
to
the
canterbury
tales
as
he
there
gives
us
a
clear
picture
of
england
in
the
time
of
edward
iii
so
addison
gives
us
a
clear
picture
of
england
in
the
time
of
anne
and
although
the
essays
are
in
the
main
unconnected
the
slight
story
of
these
characters
runs
through
them
weaving
them
into
a
whole
you
may
pick
up
a
volume
of
the
spectator
and
read
an
essay
here
or
there
at
will
with
enjoyment
or
you
may
read
the
whole
six
hundred
one
after
the
other
and
find
in
them
a
slight
but
interesting
story
you
know
that
the
books
many
of
your
friends
read
most
are
called
novels
but
in
the
days
when
joseph
addison
and
richard
steele
wrote
the
spectator
there
were
no
novels
even
defoe
stories
had
not
yet
appeared
and
it
was
therefore
a
new
delight
for
our
forefathers
to
have
the
adventures
of
the
spectator
club
each
day
with
their
morning
cup
of
tea
or
chocolate
spectator
writes
one
lady
your
paper
is
part
of
my
tea
equipage
and
my
servant
knows
my
humour
so
well
that
calling
for
my
breakfast
this
morning
it
being
past
my
usual
hour
she
answered
the
spectator
was
not
yet
come
in
but
that
the
boiled
and
she
expected
it
every
moment
thus
the
spectator
had
then
become
part
of
everyday
life
just
as
our
morning
newspapers
have
now
and
there
must
have
been
many
regrets
among
the
readers
when
one
member
of
the
supposed
club
died
another
married
and
settled
down
and
so
on
until
at
length
the
club
was
entirely
dispersed
and
the
spectator
ceased
to
appear
it
may
interest
you
to
know
that
the
paper
we
now
call
the
spectator
was
not
begun
until
more
than
a
hundred
years
after
its
great
namesake
ceased
to
appear
the
first
number
being
published
in
it
was
after
the
spectator
ceased
that
addison
published
his
tragedy
called
cato
cato
was
a
great
roman
who
rebelled
against
the
authority
of
caesar
and
in
the
end
killed
himself
his
is
a
story
out
of
which
a
good
tragedy
might
be
made
but
genius
is
not
dramatic
and
the
play
does
not
touch
our
hearts
as
shakespeare
tragedies
do
yet
although
we
can
not
look
upon
addison
cato
as
a
really
great
tragedy
there
are
lines
in
it
which
every
one
remembers
and
quotes
although
they
may
not
know
where
they
come
from
such
are
for
instance
who
deliberates
is
lost
and
is
not
in
mortals
to
command
success
but
we
do
more
sempronius
we
deserve
it
but
although
cato
is
not
really
great
the
writer
was
perhaps
the
most
popular
man
of
his
day
and
so
his
tragedy
was
a
tremendous
success
with
cato
addison
reached
the
highest
point
of
his
fame
as
an
author
in
his
own
day
but
now
we
remember
him
much
more
as
a
writer
of
delightful
essays
and
as
the
creator
or
at
least
the
perfecter
of
sir
roger
for
to
steele
is
due
the
first
invention
of
the
worthy
knight
fortune
still
smiled
on
addison
when
george
i
came
to
the
throne
the
whigs
once
more
returned
to
power
and
addison
again
became
secretary
for
ireland
he
still
wrote
both
on
behalf
of
his
government
and
to
please
himself
and
now
in
when
he
was
already
a
man
of
addison
married
his
wife
was
the
dowager
countess
of
warwick
and
perhaps
she
was
that
great
lady
whom
he
had
lost
a
few
years
before
when
he
lost
his
post
of
secretary
of
state
of
all
addison
pleasant
prosperous
life
these
last
years
ought
to
have
been
most
pleasant
and
most
prosperous
but
it
has
been
said
that
his
marriage
was
not
happy
and
that
plain
addison
was
glad
at
times
to
escape
from
the
stately
grandeur
of
his
own
home
and
from
the
great
lady
his
wife
to
drink
and
smoke
with
his
friends
and
subjects
at
his
favorite
for
addison
held
sway
and
was
surrounded
by
his
little
court
of
literary
admirers
as
dryden
and
ben
jonson
before
him
but
whether
addison
was
happy
in
his
married
life
or
not
one
sorrow
he
did
have
between
his
old
friend
dick
steele
and
himself
a
coldness
grew
up
they
disagreed
over
politics
steele
thought
himself
by
his
party
his
impatient
impetuous
temper
was
hurt
at
the
cool
balance
of
his
friend
and
so
they
quarreled
i
ask
no
favour
of
secretary
addison
writes
steele
angrily
during
life
the
quarrel
was
never
made
up
but
after
addison
died
steele
spoke
of
his
friend
in
his
old
generous
manner
under
his
new
honors
and
labours
addison
health
soon
gave
way
he
suffered
much
from
asthma
and
in
gave
up
his
government
post
a
little
more
than
a
year
later
he
died
he
met
his
end
cheerfully
and
peacefully
see
how
a
christian
can
die
he
said
to
his
wild
stepson
the
earl
of
warwick
who
came
to
say
farewell
to
his
stepfather
the
funeral
took
place
at
dead
of
night
in
westminster
abbey
whig
and
tory
alike
joined
in
mourning
and
as
the
torchlight
procession
wound
slowly
through
the
dim
isles
the
organ
played
and
the
choir
sang
a
funeral
hymn
how
silent
did
his
old
companions
tread
by
midnight
lamps
the
mansions
of
the
dead
thro
breathing
statues
then
unheeded
things
thro
rows
of
warriors
and
thro
walks
of
kings
what
awe
did
the
slow
solemn
knell
inspire
the
pealing
organ
and
the
pausing
choir
the
duties
by
the
prelate
paid
and
the
last
words
that
dust
to
dust
conveyed
while
speechless
thy
closing
grave
we
bend
accept
these
tears
thou
dear
departed
friend
tickell
so
our
great
essayist
was
laid
to
rest
but
it
was
not
until
many
years
had
come
and
gone
that
a
statue
in
his
honor
was
placed
in
the
poets
corner
this
says
lord
macaulay
himself
a
great
writer
was
a
mark
of
national
respect
due
to
the
unsullied
statesman
to
the
accomplished
scholar
to
the
master
of
pure
english
eloquence
to
the
consummate
painter
of
life
and
manners
it
was
due
above
all
to
the
great
satirist
who
alone
knew
how
to
use
ridicule
without
abusing
it
who
without
inflicting
a
wound
effected
a
great
social
reform
and
who
reconciled
wit
with
virtue
after
a
long
and
disastrous
separation
during
which
wit
had
been
lead
astray
by
profligacy
and
virtue
by
fanaticism
books
to
read
sir
roger

coverley
the
coverley
papers
edited
by
myers
chapter
lxvi
steele
the
soldier
author
you
have
heard
a
little
about
dick
steele
in
connection
with
joseph
addison
steele
is
always
overshadowed
by
his
great
friend
for
whom
he
had
such
a
generous
admiration
that
he
was
glad
to
be
so
overshadowed
but
in
this
chapter
i
mean
to
tell
you
a
little
more
about
him
he
was
born
you
know
in
dublin
in
and
early
lost
his
father
about
this
he
tells
us
himself
in
one
of
the
tatlers
the
first
sense
of
sorrow
i
ever
knew
was
upon
the
death
of
my
father
at
which
time
i
was
not
quite
five
years
of
age
but
was
rather
amazed
at
what
all
the
house
meant
than
possessed
with
a
real
understanding
why
nobody
was
willing
to
play
with
me
i
remember
i
went
into
the
room
where
his
body
lay
and
my
mother
sat
weeping
alone
by
it
i
had
my
battledore
in
my
hand
and
fell
abeating
the
coffin
and
calling
for
i
know
not
how
i
had
some
light
idea
that
he
was
locked
up
there
my
mother
catched
me
in
her
arms
and
transported
beyond
all
patience
of
the
silent
grief
she
was
before
in
she
almost
smothered
me
in
her
embrace
and
told
me
in
a
flood
of
tears
pap
could
not
hear
me
and
would
play
with
me
no
more
for
they
were
going
to
put
him
under
ground
whence
he
could
never
come
to
us
again
steele
sad
beautiful
mother
died
soon
after
her
husband
and
little
dick
was
left
more
lonely
than
ever
his
uncle
took
charge
of
him
and
sent
him
to
charterhouse
where
he
met
addison
from
there
he
went
to
oxford
but
left
without
taking
a
degree
a
drum
passing
by
he
says
being
a
lover
of
music
i
listed
myself
for
a
soldier
he
mounted
a
war
horse
with
a
great
sword
in
his
hand
and
planted
himself
behind
king
william
the
third
against
lewis
the
fourteenth
but
he
says
when
he
cocked
his
hat
and
put
on
a
broad
sword
jack
boots
and
shoulder
belt
he
did
not
know
his
own
powers
as
a
writer
he
did
not
know
then
that
he
should
ever
be
able
to
demolish
a
fortified
town
with
a
goosequill
so
steele
became
a
wretched
common
trooper
or
to
put
it
more
politely
a
gentleman
volunteer
but
he
was
not
long
in
becoming
an
ensign
and
about
five
years
later
he
got
his
commission
as
captain
in
those
days
the
life
of
a
soldier
was
wild
and
rough
drinking
and
swearing
were
perhaps
the
least
among
the
follies
and
wickedness
they
were
given
to
and
dick
steele
was
as
ready
as
any
other
to
join
in
all
the
wildness
going
but
in
spite
of
his
faults
and
failings
his
heart
was
kind
and
tender
he
had
no
love
of
wickedness
though
he
could
not
resist
temptation
so
the
dashing
soldier
astonished
his
companions
by
publishing
a
little
book
called
the
christian
hero
it
was
a
little
book
written
to
show
that
no
man
could
be
truly
great
who
was
not
religious
he
wrote
it
at
odd
minutes
when
his
day
work
was
over
when
his
mind
had
time
in
the
silent
watch
of
the
night
to
run
over
the
busy
dream
of
the
day
he
wrote
it
at
first
for
his
own
use
to
make
him
ashamed
of
understanding
and
seeming
to
feel
what
was
virtuous
and
yet
living
so
quite
contrary
a
life
afterwards
he
resolved
to
publish
it
for
the
good
of
others
but
among
steele
gay
companions
the
book
had
little
effect
except
to
make
them
laugh
at
him
and
draw
comparisons
between
the
lightness
of
his
words
and
actions
and
the
seriousness
of
the
ideas
set
forth
in
his
christian
hero
he
found
himself
slighted
instead
of
encouraged
and
from
being
thought
no
undelightful
companion
was
soon
reckoned
a
disagreeable
fellow
so
he
took
to
writing
plays
for
nothing
can
make
the
town
so
fond
of
a
man
as
a
successful
play
for
himself
and
his
writings
the
plays
of
the
restoration
had
been
very
coarse
those
of
steele
show
the
beginning
of
a
taste
for
better
things
full
of
incidents
that
move
laughter
virtue
and
vice
appear
just
as
they
ought
to
do
he
says
of
his
first
comedy
but
although
we
may
still
find
steele
plays
rather
amusing
it
is
not
as
a
dramatist
that
we
remember
him
but
as
an
essayist
steele
led
a
life
nearly
always
cheerful
and
in
debt
his
plays
brought
him
in
some
money
he
received
a
government
appointment
which
brought
him
more
and
when
he
was
about
he
married
a
rich
widow
still
he
was
always
in
debt
always
in
want
of
money
in
about
a
year
steele
wife
died
and
he
was
shortly
married
to
another
lady
about
this
time
he
left
the
army
it
is
thought
although
we
do
not
know
quite
surely
and
for
long
afterwards
he
was
called
captain
steele
steele
wrote
a
great
many
letters
to
his
second
wife
both
before
and
after
his
marriage
she
kept
them
all
and
from
them
we
can
learn
a
good
deal
of
this
husband
she
is
dearest
creature
dear
wife
dear
prue
her
name
by
the
way
was
mary
and
sometimes
ruler
absolute
governess
and
he
your
devoted
obedient
husband
your
faithful
tender
husband
many
of
the
letters
are
about
money
troubles
we
gather
from
them
that
dick
steele
loved
his
wife
but
as
he
was
a
gay
and
careless
spendthrift
and
she
was
a
proud
beauty
a
scornful
lady
for
neither
of
them
was
life
always
easy
it
was
about
two
years
after
this
second
marriage
that
steele
suddenly
began
the
tatler
he
did
not
write
under
his
own
name
but
under
that
of
isaac
bickerstaff
a
name
which
swift
had
made
use
of
in
writing
one
of
his
satires
as
has
been
said
the
genius
of
steele
has
been
overshadowed
by
that
of
addison
for
steele
had
such
a
admiration
for
his
friend
that
he
was
ready
to
give
him
all
the
praise
and
yet
it
is
nearly
always
to
steele
that
we
owe
the
ideas
which
were
later
worked
out
and
perfected
by
addison
it
is
steele
too
that
we
owe
the
first
pictures
of
english
family
life
it
has
been
said
that
he
was
the
first
of
our
writers
who
really
seemed
to
admire
and
respect
women
and
if
we
add
after
the
restoration
we
come
very
near
the
truth
steele
had
a
tender
heart
towards
children
too
and
in
more
than
one
paper
his
love
of
them
shows
itself
indeed
as
we
read
we
can
not
help
believing
that
in
real
life
captain
dick
had
many
here
is
how
he
tells
of
a
visit
to
a
house
i
am
as
it
were
at
home
at
that
house
and
every
member
of
it
knows
me
for
their
i
can
not
indeed
express
the
pleasure
it
is
to
be
met
by
the
children
with
so
much
joy
as
i
am
when
i
go
thither
the
boys
and
girls
strive
who
shall
come
first
when
they
think
it
is
i
that
am
knocking
at
the
door
and
that
child
which
loses
the
race
to
me
runs
back
again
to
tell
the
father
it
is
bickerstaff
this
day
i
was
led
in
by
a
pretty
girl
that
we
all
thought
must
have
forgot
me
for
the
family
has
been
out
of
town
these
two
years
her
knowing
me
again
was
a
mighty
subject
with
us
and
took
up
our
discourse
at
the
first
entrance
after
which
they
began
to
rally
me
upon
a
thousand
little
stories
they
heard
in
the
country
about
my
marriage
to
one
of
my
neighbor
daughters
upon
which
the
gentleman
my
friend
said
if
bickerstaff
marries
a
child
of
any
of
his
old
companions
i
hope
mine
shall
have
the
preference
there
mistress
mary
is
now
sixteen
and
would
make
him
as
fine
a
widow
as
the
best
of
them
after
dinner
the
mother
and
children
leave
the
two
friends
together
the
father
speaks
of
his
love
for
his
wife
and
his
fears
for
her
health
you
little
understand
you
that
have
lived
a
bachelor
how
great
a
pleasure
there
is
in
being
really
beloved
her
face
is
to
me
more
beautiful
than
when
i
first
saw
it
in
her
examination
of
her
household
affairs
she
show
a
certain
fearfulness
to
find
a
fault
which
makes
her
servants
obey
her
like
children
and
the
meanest
we
have
has
an
ingenuous
shame
for
an
offence
not
always
to
be
seen
in
children
in
other
families
i
speak
freely
to
you
my
old
friend
ever
since
her
sickness
things
that
gave
me
the
quickest
joy
before
turn
now
to
a
certain
anxiety
as
the
children
play
in
the
next
room
i
know
the
poor
things
by
their
steps
and
am
considering
what
they
must
do
should
they
lose
their
mother
in
their
tender
years
the
pleasure
i
used
to
take
in
telling
my
boy
stories
of
the
battles
and
asking
my
girl
questions
about
the
disposal
of
her
baby
and
the
gossiping
of
it
is
turned
into
inward
reflection
and
melancholy
the
poor
gentleman
would
have
gone
on
much
longer
with
his
sad
forebodings
but
his
wife
returning
and
seeing
by
his
grave
face
what
he
had
been
talking
about
said
with
a
smile
bickerstaff
do
believe
a
word
of
what
he
tells
you
i
shall
still
live
to
have
you
for
my
second
as
i
have
often
promised
you
unless
he
takes
more
care
of
himself
than
he
has
done
since
his
coming
to
town
you
must
know
he
tells
me
that
he
finds
london
is
a
much
more
healthy
place
than
the
country
for
he
sees
several
of
his
old
acquaintance
and
fellows
are
here
young
fellows
with
fair
periwigs
i
could
scarce
keep
him
this
morning
from
going
out
and
so
they
sat
and
chatted
pleasantly
until
on
a
sudden
we
were
alarmed
with
the
noise
of
a
drum
and
immediately
entered
my
little
godson
to
give
me
a
point
of
war
his
mother
between
laughing
and
chiding
would
have
put
him
out
of
the
room
but
i
would
not
part
with
him
so
i
found
upon
conversation
with
him
though
he
was
a
little
noisy
in
his
mirth
that
the
child
had
excellent
parts
and
was
a
great
master
of
all
the
learning
on
the
other
side
of
eight
years
old
i
perceived
him
to
be
a
very
great
historian
in
aesop
fables
but
he
frankly
declared
to
me
his
mind
that
he
did
not
delight
in
that
learning
because
he
did
not
believe
they
were
true
for
which
reason
i
found
he
had
very
much
turned
his
studies
for
about
a
past
into
the
lives
and
adventures
of
don
bellianis
of
greece
guy
of
warwick
the
seven
champions
and
other
historians
of
that
age
strain
of
music
i
could
not
but
observe
the
satisfaction
the
father
took
in
the
forwardness
of
his
son
and
that
these
diversions
might
turn
to
some
profit
i
found
the
boy
had
made
remarks
which
might
be
of
service
to
him
during
the
course
of
his
whole
life
he
would
tell
you
the
mismanagements
of
john
hickathrift
find
fault
with
the
passionate
temper
of
bevis
of
southampton
and
loved
george
for
being
the
champion
of
england
and
by
this
means
had
his
thoughts
insensibly
moulded
into
the
notions
of
discretion
virtue
and
honour
i
was
extolling
his
accomplishments
when
the
mother
told
me
that
the
little
girl
who
led
me
in
this
morning
was
in
her
way
a
better
scholar
than
he
says
she
chiefly
in
fairies
and
sprites
and
sometimes
in
a
winter
night
will
terrify
the
maids
with
her
accounts
till
they
are
afraid
to
go
up
to
bed
i
sat
with
them
till
it
was
very
late
sometimes
in
merry
sometimes
in
serious
discourse
with
this
particular
pleasure
which
gives
the
only
true
relish
to
all
conversation
a
sense
that
every
one
of
us
liked
each
other
i
went
home
considering
the
different
conditions
of
a
married
life
and
that
of
a
bachelor
and
i
must
confess
it
struck
me
with
a
secret
concern
to
reflect
that
whenever
i
go
off
i
shall
leave
no
traces
behind
me
in
this
pensive
mood
i
returned
to
my
family
that
is
to
say
to
my
maid
my
dog
and
my
cat
who
only
can
be
the
better
or
worse
for
what
happens
to
me
you
will
be
sorry
to
know
that
a
few
tatlers
further
on
the
kind
mother
of
this
happy
family
dies
but
steele
was
himself
so
much
touched
by
the
thought
of
all
the
misery
he
was
bringing
upon
the
others
by
giving
such
a
sad
ending
to
his
story
that
he
could
not
go
on
with
the
paper
and
addison
had
to
finish
it
for
him
the
spectator
you
know
succeeded
the
tatler
and
it
was
while
writing
for
the
spectator
that
steele
took
seriously
to
politics
he
became
a
member
of
parliament
and
wrote
hot
political
articles
he
and
swift
crossed
swords
more
than
once
and
from
being
friends
became
enemies
but
steele
temper
was
too
hot
his
pen
too
hasty
the
tories
were
in
power
and
he
was
a
whig
and
he
presently
found
himself
expelled
from
the
house
of
commons
for
uttering
seditious
libels
shut
out
from
politics
steele
turned
once
more
to
and
published
one
after
the
other
several
papers
of
the
same
style
as
the
spectator
but
none
of
them
lived
long
better
days
however
were
coming
queen
anne
died
and
king
george
became
a
king
in
the
whigs
returned
to
power
steele
again
received
a
government
post
again
he
sat
in
parliament
and
a
few
months
later
he
was
knighted
and
became
sir
richard
steele
we
can
not
follow
him
through
all
his
projects
adventures
and
writings
he
was
made
one
of
the
commissioners
for
the
forfeited
estates
of
the
scottish
lords
who
had
taken
part
in
the
and
upon
this
business
he
went
several
times
to
scotland
the
first
time
he
went
was
in
the
autumn
of
but
before
that
lady
steele
had
gone
to
wales
to
look
after
her
estates
there
while
she
was
there
dick
wrote
many
letters
to
her
some
of
which
are
full
of
tenderness
for
his
children
they
show
us
something
too
of
the
household
in
the
absence
of
the
careful
mistress
in
one
he
says
your
son
at
the
present
writing
is
mighty
well
employed
in
tumbling
on
the
floor
of
the
room
and
sweeping
the
sand
with
a
feather
he
grows
a
most
delightful
child
and
very
full
of
play
and
spirit
he
is
also
a
very
great
scholar
he
can
read
his
primer
and
i
have
brought
down
my
virgil
he
makes
most
shrewd
remarks
about
the
pictures
we
are
very
intimate
friends
and
he
begins
to
be
very
ragged
and
i
hope
i
shall
be
pardoned
if
i
equip
him
with
new
clothes
and
frocks
or
again
the
brats
my
girls
stand
on
each
side
of
the
table
and
molly
says
what
i
am
writing
now
is
about
her
new
coat
bess
is
with
me
till
she
has
new
clothes
miss
moll
has
taken
upon
her
to
hold
the
and
is
so
impertinent
in
her
office
that
i
can
not
write
more
but
you
are
to
take
this
letter
as
from
your
three
best
friends
bess
moll
and
their
father
those
days
there
was
no
and
sand
was
used
to
dry
the
ink
moll
bids
me
let
you
know
that
she
fell
down
just
now
and
did
not
hurt
herself
soon
after
this
steele
set
out
for
scotland
and
although
the
business
which
brought
him
could
not
have
been
welcome
to
many
a
scottish
gentleman
he
himself
was
well
received
they
forgot
the
whig
official
in
the
famous
writer
in
edinburgh
he
was
feasted
and
feted
you
can
not
imagine
wrote
steele
the
civilities
and
honours
i
had
done
me
there
i
never
lay
better
ate
or
drank
better
or
conversed
with
men
of
better
sense
than
there
poets
and
authors
greeted
him
in
verse
he
was
kind
richy
spec
the
friend
to
a
distressed
dear
spec
and
many
stories
are
told
of
his
doings
among
these
friends
he
paid
several
later
visits
to
scotland
but
about
a
year
after
his
return
from
this
first
short
visit
steele
had
a
great
sorrow
his
wife
died
this
is
to
let
you
know
he
writes
to
a
cousin
that
my
dear
and
honoured
wife
departed
this
life
last
night
and
now
that
his
children
were
motherless
steele
when
he
was
away
from
them
wrote
to
them
always
tender
often
funny
letters
it
is
betty
the
eldest
he
addresses
she
is
dear
child
my
dear
daughter
my
good
girlie
he
bids
them
be
good
and
grow
like
their
mother
i
have
observed
that
your
sister
he
says
in
one
letter
has
for
the
first
time
written
the
initial
or
first
letters
of
her
name
tell
her
i
am
highly
delighted
to
see
her
subscription
in
such
fair
letters
and
how
many
fine
things
those
two
letters
stand
for
when
she
writes
them
is
milk
and
sugar
mirth
and
safety
music
and
songs
meat
and
sauce
as
well
as
molly
and
spot
and
mary
and
steele
i
think
the
children
must
have
loved
their
kind
father
who
wrote
such
pretty
nonsense
to
them
so
with
ups
and
downs
the
years
passed
however
much
money
steele
got
he
never
seemed
to
have
any
and
in
spite
of
all
his
carelessness
and
jovialness
there
is
something
sad
in
those
last
years

for
ever
lost
his
friend
joseph
addison
his
two
sons
died
and
at
length
broken
in
health
troubled
about
money
he
went
to
spend
his
last
days
in
carmarthen
in
wales
here
we
have
a
last
pleasant
picture
of
him
being
carried
out
on
a
summer
evening
to
watch
the
country
lads
and
lasses
dance
and
with
his
own
hand
paralyzed
though
it
was
he
would
write
an
order
for
a
new
gown
to
be
given
to
the

in

pope
the
rape
of
the
lock
as
you
have
already
guessed
by
the
number
of
prose
writers
you
have
been
reading
about
this
age
the
age
of
the
last
stuarts
and
the
first
georges
was
not
a
poetic
one
it
was
an
age
of
art
and
posturing
it
was
an
age
of
fierce
and
passionate
party
strife
strife
between
whig
and
tory
which
almost
amounted
to
civil
war
but
instead
of
using
swords
and
guns
the
men
who
took
part
in
the
strife
used
pen
and
ink
they
played
the
game
without
any
rules
of
fair
play
no
weapon
was
too
vile
or
mean
to
be
used
if
by
it
the
enemy
might
be
injured
you
have
often
been
told
that
it
is
rude
to
make
personal
remarks
but
the
age
of
anne
was
the
age
of
personal
remarks
and
they
were
not
considered
rude
the
more
cruel
and
pointed
they
were
the
more
clever
they
were
thought
to
be
to
be
stupid
or
ugly
are
not
sins
they
ought
not
to
be
causes
of
scorn
and
laughter
but
in
the
age
of
anne
they
were
accepted
as
such
and
if
the
enemy
was
worsted
in
the
fight
he
took
his
revenge
by
holding
up
to
ridicule
the
person
of
his
victor
to
raise
the
unkind
laughter
of
the
world
against
an
enemy
was
the
great
thing
to
be
aimed
at
added
to
this
too
the
age
was
one
of
common
sense
all
this
does
not
make
for
poetry
yet
in
this
age
there
was
one
poet
who
although
he
does
not
rank
among
our
greatest
poets
was
still
great
and
perhaps
had
he
lived
in
a
less
artificial
age
he
might
have
been
greater
still
this
poet
was
alexander
pope
the
son
of
a
catholic
he
was
born
in
london
in
but
soon
afterwards
his
father
retired
from
business
and
went
to
live
in
a
little
village
not
far
from
windsor
alexander
was
an
only
son
he
had
one
but
she
was
a
good
many
years
older
than
he
and
he
seems
never
to
have
had
any
child
companions
or
real
childhood
he
must
always
have
been
delicate
yet
as
a
child
his
face
was
round
plump
pretty
and
of
a
fresh
complexion
he
is
said
too
to
have
been
very
sweet
tempered
but
his
father
and
mother
spoilt
him
not
a
little
and
when
he
grew
up
he
lost
that
sweetness
of
temper
yet
unlike
many
spoilt
children
pope
never
forgot
the
reverence
due
to
father
and
mother
he
repaid
their
love
with
love
as
warm
and
in
their
old
age
he
tended
and
cared
for
them
fondly
anecdotes
as
pope
was
a
delicate
boy
he
got
little
regular
schooling
he
learned
to
write
by
copying
the
printed
letters
in
books
and
was
first
taught
to
read
by
an
aunt
and
later
by
a
priest
but
still
at
home
after
a
time
he
was
at
school
for
a
few
years
but
he
went
from
one
school
to
another
never
staying
long
at
any
and
so
never
learning
much
he
says
indeed
that
he
unlearned
at
two
of
his
schools
all
that
he
had
learned
at
another
by
the
time
he
was
twelve
he
was
once
more
at
home
reading
what
he
liked
and
learning
what
he
liked
and
he
read
and
studied
so
greedily
that
he
made
himself
pope
loved
the
stories
of
the
greek
and
roman
heroes
but
he
did
not
care
for
the
hard
work
needed
to
learn
to
read
them
in
the
original
with
ease
and
contented
himself
with
translations
he
was
so
fond
of
these
stories
that
while
still
a
little
boy
he
made
a
play
from
the
iliad
which
was
acted
by
the
boys
of
one
of
his
schools
very
early
pope
began
to
write
poetry
he
read
a
great
deal
and
two
of
his
favorite
poets
were
spenser
and
dryden
his
great
idea
was
to
become
a
poet
also
and
in
this
his
father
encouraged
him
although
no
poet
himself
he
would
set
his
little
son
to
make
verses
upon
different
subjects
he
was
pretty
difficult
in
being
pleased
says
pope
mother
and
used
often
to
send
him
back
to
new
turn
them
are
not
good
rhymes
he
would
say
there
is
a
story
told
that
pope
admired
dryden
poetry
so
much
that
he
persuaded
a
friend
to
take
him
one
day
to
london
to
the
where
dryden
used
to
hold
his
little
court
there
he
saw
the
great
man
who
spoke
to
him
and
gave
him
a
shilling
for
some
verses
he
wrote
but
the
story
is
a
very
doubtful
one
as
dryden
died
when
pope
was
twelve
years
old
and
for
some
time
before
that
he
had
been
too
ill
to
go
to
but
that
pope
admiration
for
dryden
was
very
sincere
and
very
great
we
know
for
he
chose
him
as
his
model
like
dryden
pope
wrote
in
the
heroic
couplet
and
in
his
hands
it
became
much
more
neat
and
polished
than
ever
it
did
in
the
hands
of
the
older
poet
pope
saw
dryden
only
once
even
if
the
story
is
true
but
with
another
old
poet
a
dramatist
he
struck
up
a
great
friendship
this
poet
was
named
wycherley
but
by
the
time
that
pope
came
to
know
him
wycherley
had
grown
old
and
feeble
all
his
best
work
was
done
and
people
were
perhaps
beginning
to
forget
him
so
he
was
pleased
with
the
admiration
of
the
boy
poet
fifty
years
younger
than
himself
and
glad
to
accept
his
help
at
first
this
flattered
pope
vanity
but
after
a
little
he
quarreled
with
his
old
friend
and
left
him
this
was
the
first
of
pope
literary
quarrels
of
which
he
had
many
already
as
a
boy
pope
was
becoming
known
he
had
published
a
few
short
poems
and
others
were
handed
about
in
manuscript
among
his
friends
that
young
fellow
will
either
be
a
madman
or
make
a
very
great
poet
said
one
man
after
meeting
him
when
he
was
about
fourteen
all
the
praise
and
attention
which
pope
received
pleased
him
much
but
he
took
it
only
as
his
due
and
his
great
ambition
was
to
make
people
believe
that
he
had
been
a
wonderfully
clever
child
and
that
he
had
begun
to
write
when
he
was
very
young
he
says
of
himself
with
something
of
pompousness
i
lisp
in
numbers
for
the
numbers
came
smith
pope
keenest
desire
was
to
be
a
poet
and
few
poets
have
rushed
so
quickly
into
fame
he
received
few
of
the
buffets
which
young
authors
have
as
a
rule
to
bear
instead
many
a
kindly
helping
hand
was
stretched
out
to
him
by
the
great
men
of
the
day
for
there
was
much
in
this
young
genius
to
draw
out
the
pity
of
others
he
was
fragile
and
sickly
as
a
full
grown
man
he
stood
only
four
feet
six
inches
high
his
body
was
bent
and
deformed
and
so
frail
that
he
had
to
be
strapped
in
canvas
to
give
him
some
support
his
fine
face
was
lined
by
pain
for
he
suffered
from
racking
headaches
and
indeed
his
life
was
one
long
disease
yet
in
spite
of
constant
pain
this
little
crooked
boy
with
his
little
tender
crazy
carcass
as
wycherley
called
it
wrote
the
most
astonishing
poetry
in
a
style
which
in
his
own
day
was
considered
the
finest
that
could
be
written
it
is
not
surprising
then
that
his
poems
were
greeted
with
kindly
wonder
mixed
it
may
be
with
a
little
envy
unhappily
pope
saw
only
the
envy
and
overlooked
the
kindliness
perhaps
it
was
that
his
crooked
little
body
had
warped
the
great
mind
it
held
but
certain
it
is
as
pope
grew
to
manhood
his
thirst
for
praise
and
glory
increased
and
with
it
his
distrust
and
envy
of
others
and
many
of
the
ways
he
took
to
add
to
his
own
fame
and
take
away
from
that
of
others
were
mean
and
tortuous
to
the
last
degree
deceit
and
crooked
ways
seemed
necessary
to
him
it
has
been
said
that
he
hardly
drank
tea
without
a
stratagem
and
that
he
played
the
politician
about
cabbages
and
turnips
bolingbroke
he
begged
his
own
letters
back
from
the
friends
to
whom
they
were
written
he
altered
them
changed
the
dates
and
published
them
then
he
raised
a
great
outcry
pretending
that
they
had
been
stolen
from
him
and
published
without
his
knowledge
such
ways
led
to
quarrels
and
strife
while
he
was
alive
and
since
his
death
they
have
puzzled
every
one
who
has
tried
to
write
about
him
all
his
life
through
he
was
hardly
ever
without
a
literary
quarrel
of
some
sort
some
of
his
poems
indeed
being
called
forth
merely
by
these
quarrels
but
though
many
of
pope
poems
led
to
quarrels
and
some
were
written
with
the
desire
to
provoke
them
one
of
his
most
famous
poems
was
on
the
other
hand
written
to
bring
peace
between
two
angry
families
this
poem
is
called
the
rape
of
the
lock
rape
meaning
theft
and
the
lock
not
the
lock
of
a
door
but
a
lock
of
hair
a
gay
young
lord
had
stolen
a
lock
of
a
beautiful
young
hair
and
she
was
so
angry
about
it
that
there
was
a
coolness
between
the
two
families
a
friend
then
came
to
pope
to
ask
him
if
he
could
not
do
something
to
appease
the
angry
lady
so
pope
took
up
his
pen
and
wrote
a
poem
making
friendly
fun
of
the
whole
matter
but
although
pope
intention
was
kindly
his
success
was
not
complete
the
families
did
not
entirely
see
the
joke
and
pope
writes
to
a
friend
the
celebrated
lady
herself
is
offended
and
what
is
stranger
not
at
herself
but
me
but
the
poem
remains
one
of
the
most
delightful
of
airy
trifles
in
our
language
and
that
it
should
be
so
airy
is
a
triumph
of
pope
genius
for
it
is
written
in
the
heroic
couplet
one
of
the
most
mechanical
forms
of
english
verse
addison
called
it
a
delicious
little
thing
and
the
very
salt
of
wit
another
and
later
writer
says
of
it
it
is
the
most
exquisite
specimen
of
filigree
work
ever
invented
it
is
made
of
gauze
and
silver
spangles
airs
languid
airs
breathe
around
the
atmosphere
is
perfumed
with
affectation
a
toilet
is
described
with
the
solemnity
of
an
altar
raised
to
the
goddess
of
vanity
and
the
history
of
a
silver
bodkin
is
given
with
all
the
pomp
of
heraldry
no
pains
are
spared
no
profusion
of
ornament
no
splendour
of
poetic
diction
to
set
off
the
meanest
things
it
is
the
perfection
of
the
pope
begins
the
poem
by
describing
belinda
the
heroine
awaking
from
sleep
he
tells
how
her
guardian
sylph
brings
a
morning
dream
to
warn
her
of
coming
danger
in
the
dream
she
is
told
that
all
around
her
unnumbered
fairy
spirits
fly
guarding
her
from
evil
of
these
am
i
who
thy
protection
claim
a
watchful
sprite
and
ariel
is
my
name
late
as
i
ranged
the
crystal
wilds
of
air
in
the
clear
mirror
of
thy
ruling
star
i
saw
alas
some
dread
event
impend
ere
to
the
main
this
morning
sun
descend
but
heaven
reveals
not
what
or
how
or
where
warned
by
the
sylph
oh
pious
maid
beware
this
to
disclose
is
all
thy
guardian
can
beware
of
all
but
most
beware
of
man
then
shock
belinda
dog
who
thought
she
slept
too
long
leaped
up
and
waked
his
mistress
with
his
tongue
so
belinda
rises
and
is
dressed
while
her
maid
seems
to
do
the
work
the
busy
sylphs
surround
their
darling
care
these
set
the
head
and
those
divide
the
hair
some
fold
the
sleeve
whilst
others
plait
the
and
betty
praised
for
labours
not
her
own
next
belinda
set
out
upon
the
thames
to
go
by
boat
to
hampton
court
and
as
she
sat
in
her
gayly
decorated
boat
she
looked
so
beautiful
that
every
eye
was
turned
to
gaze
upon
her
on
her
white
breast
a
sparkling
cross
she
wore
which
jews
might
kiss
and
infidels
adore
she
was
so
beautiful
and
graceful
that
it
seemed
as
if
she
could
have
no
faults
or
if
to
her
share
some
female
errors
fall
look
in
her
face
and
you
forget
them
all
this
nymph
to
the
destruction
of
mankind
nourished
two
locks
which
graceful
hung
behind
in
equal
curls
and
well
conspired
to
deck
with
shining
ringlets
the
smoothe
neck
love
in
these
labyrinths
his
slaves
detains
and
mighty
hearts
are
held
in
slender
chains
with
hairy
springes

the
birds
betray
slight
lines

the
finny

fair
tresses
man
imperial
race
insnare
and
beauty
draws
us
with
a
single

the
adventurous
baron
next
appears
upon
the
scene
he
greatly
admiring
belinda
shining
locks
longs
to
possess
one
and
makes
up
his
mind
that
he
will
and
as
the
painted
vessel
glided
down
the
thames
belinda
smiled
and
all
the
world
was
gay
only
ariel
alone
was
sad
and
disturbed
for
he
felt
some
evil
he
knew
not
what
was
hanging
over
his
mistress
so
he
gathered
all
his
company
and
bade
them
watch
more
warily
than
before
over
their
charge
some
must
guard
the
watch
some
the
fan
and
thou
crispissa
tend
her
lock
he
says
and
woe
betide
that
sprite
who
shall
be
careless
or
neglectful
whatever
spirit
careless
of
his
charge
his
post
neglects
or
leaves
the
fair
at
large
shall
feel
sharp
vengeance
soon
his
sins
be
stopped
in
vials
or
transfixed
with
pins
or
plunged
in
lakes
of
bitter
washes
lie
or
wedged
whole
ages
in
a
bodkin
eye
so
the
watchful
sprites
flew
off
to
their
places
some
orb
in
orb
around
the
nymph
extend
some
the
mazy
ringlets
of
her
hair
some
hang
upon
the
pendants
of
her
ear
through
the
day
went
on
belinda
sat
down
to
play
cards
after
the
game
coffee
was
brought
and
while
frequent
cups
prolong
the
rich
repast
belinda
unthinkingly
gave
the
baron
a
pair
of
scissors
then
indeed
the
hour
of
fate
struck
the
baron
standing
behind
belinda
found
the
temptation
too
great
he
opened
the
scissors
and
drew
near
swift
to
the
lock
a
thousand
sprites
repair
a
thousand
wings
by
turns
blow
back
the
hair
and
thrice
they
twitched
the
diamond
in
her
ear
thrice
she
looked
back
and
thrice
the
foe
drew
near
but
at
last
the
fatal
engine
closed
upon
the
lock
even
to
the
last
one
wretched
sylph
struggling
to
save
the
lock
clung
to
it
it
was
in
vain
fate
urged
the
shears
and
cut
the
sylph
in
twain
then
while
belinda
cried
aloud
in
anger
the
baron
shouted
in
triumph
and
rejoiced
over
his
spoil
the
poem
goes
on
to
tell
how
umbriel
a
dusky
melancholy
sprite
in
order
to
make
the
quarrel
worse
flew
off
to
the
witch
spleen
and
returned
with
a
bag
full
of
sighs
sobs
and
passions
and
the
war
of
tongues
soft
sorrows
melting
griefs
and
flowing
tears
and
emptied
it
over
belinda
head
she
then
raging
to
sir
plume
repairs
and
bids
her
beau
demand
the
precious
hairs
sir
plume
of
amber
justly
vain
and
the
nice
conduct
of
a
clouded
case
with
earnest
eyes
and
round
unthinking
face
he
first
the
opened
then
the
case
sir
plume
not
famous
for
brains
put
on
a
very
bold
determined
air
and
fiercely
attacked
the
baron
my
lord
he
cried
why
what
you
must
return
the
lock
you
must
be
civil
plague
on
is
past
a
jest
nay
prithee
give
her
the
hair
and
as
he
spoke
he
tapped
his
daintily
but
in
spite
of
this
valiant
champion
of
fair
ladies
in
distress
the
baron
would
not
return
the
lock
so
a
deadly
battle
followed
in
which
the
ladies
fought
against
the
gentlemen
and
in
which
the
sprites
also
took
part
the
weapons
were
only
frowns
and
angry
glances
a
beau
and
witling
perished
in
the
throng
one
died
in
metaphor
and
one
in
song
a
mournful
glance
sir
fopling
upwards
cast
eyes
were
made
so
killing
was
his
last
belinda
however
at
length
disarmed
the
baron
with
a
pinch
of
snuff
and
threatened
his
life
with
a
hair
pin
and
so
the
battle
ends
but
alas
the
lock
obtained
with
guilt
and
kept
with
pain
in
place
is
sought
but
sought
in
vain
during
the
fight
it
has
been
caught
up
to
the
skies
a
sudden
star
it
shot
through
liquid
air
and
drew
behind
a
radiant
trail
of
hair
thus
says
the
poet
belinda
has
no
longer
need
to
mourn
her
lost
lock
for
it
will
be
famous
to
the
end
of
time
as
a
bright
star
among
the
stars
then
cease
bright
nymph
to
mourn
thy
ravished
hair
which
adds
new
glory
to
the
starry
sphere
not
all
the
tresses
that
fair
head
can
boast
shall
draw
such
envy
as
the
lock
you
lost
for
after
all
the
murders
of
your
eye
when
after
millions
slain
yourself
shall
die
when
those
fair
suns
shall
set
as
set
they
must
and
all
those
tresses
shall
be
laid
in
dust
this
lock
the
muse
shall
consecrate
to
fame
and
midst
the
stars
inscribe
belinda
name
when
pope
first
published
this
poem
there
was
nothing
about
fairies
in
it
afterwards
he
thought
of
the
fairies
but
addison
advised
him
not
to
alter
the
poem
as
it
was
so
delightful
as
it
was
pope
however
did
not
take
the
advice
but
added
the
fairy
part
thereby
greatly
improving
the
poem
this
caused
a
quarrel
with
addison
for
pope
thought
he
had
given
him
bad
advice
through
jealousy
a
little
later
this
quarrel
was
made
much
worse
pope
translated
and
published
a
version
of
the
iliad
and
at
the
same
time
a
friend
of
addison
did
so
too
this
made
pope
bitterly
angry
for
he
believed
that
the
translation
was
addison
own
and
that
he
had
published
it
to
injure
the
sale
of
his
from
this
you
see
how
easily
pope
anger
and
jealousy
were
aroused
and
will
not
wonder
that
his
life
was
a
long
record
of
quarrels
pope
need
not
have
been
jealous
of
addison
friend
for
his
own
translation
of
homer
was
a
great
success
and
people
soon
forgot
the
other
he
translated
not
only
the
iliad
but
with
the
help
of
two
lesser
poets
the
odyssey
also
both
poems
were
done
in
the
fashionable
heroic
couplet
and
pope
made
so
much
money
by
them
that
he
was
able
to
live
in
comfort
ever
after
and
it
is
interesting
to
remember
that
pope
was
the
first
poet
who
was
able
to
live
in
comfort
entirely
on
what
he
made
by
his
writing
pope
now
took
a
house
at
twickenham
and
there
he
spent
many
happy
hours
planning
and
laying
out
his
garden
and
building
a
grotto
with
shells
and
stones
and
bits
of
the
house
has
long
ago
been
pulled
down
and
the
garden
altered
but
the
grotto
still
remains
a
sight
for
the
curious
it
has
been
said
that
to
write
in
the
heroic
couplet
is
an
art
as
mechanical
as
that
of
mending
a
kettle
or
shoeing
a
horse
and
may
be
learned
by
any
human
being
who
has
sense
enough
to
learn
anything
and
although
this
is
not
all
true
it
is
so
far
true
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
tell
which
books
of
the
odyssey
were
written
by
pope
and
which
by
the
men
who
helped
him
but
taken
as
a
whole
the
odyssey
is
not
so
good
as
the
iliad
scholars
tell
us
that
in
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
is
the
feeling
of
the
original
poetry
kept
pope
did
not
know
enough
greek
to
enter
into
the
spirit
of
it
and
he
worked
mostly
from
translation
even
had
he
been
able
to
enter
into
the
true
spirit
he
would
have
found
it
hard
to
keep
that
spirit
in
his
translation
using
as
he
did
the
artificial
heroic
couplet
for
homer
poetry
is
not
artificial
but
simple
and
natural
like
our
own
early
poetry
a
pretty
poem
pope
but
you
must
not
call
it
homer
said
a
when
he
read
it
and
his
judgment
is
still
for
the
most
part
the
judgment
of
it
was
after
he
had
finished
the
odyssey
that
pope
wrote
his
most
famous
satire
called
the
dunciad
in
this
he
insulted
and
held
up
to
ridicule
all
stupid
or
dull
authors
all
dunces
and
all
those
whom
he
considered
his
enemies
it
is
very
clever
but
a
poem
full
of
malice
and
hatred
does
not
make
very
pleasant
reading
for
most
of
us
too
the
interest
it
had
has
vanished
as
many
of
the
people
at
whom
pope
levied
his
malice
are
forgotten
or
only
remembered
because
he
made
them
famous
by
adding
their
names
to
his
roll
of
dunces
but
in
pope
own
day
the
dunciad
called
forth
cries
of
anger
and
revenge
from
the
victims
and
involved
the
author
in
still
more
quarrels
pope
wrote
many
more
poems
the
chief
being
the
essay
on
criticism
and
the
essay
on
man
but
his
translations
of
homer
and
the
rape
of
the
lock
are
those
you
will
like
best
in
the
meantime
as
a
whole
pope
is
perhaps
not
much
read
now
yet
many
of
his
lines
have
become
household
words
and
when
you
come
to
read
him
you
will
be
surprised
to
find
how
many
familiar
quotations
are
taken
from
his
poems
perhaps
no
one
of
our
poets
except
shakespeare
is
more
quoted
and
yet
he
seldom
says
anything
which
touches
the
heart
when
we
enjoy
his
poetry
we
enjoy
it
with
the
brain
it
gives
us
pleasure
rather
as
the
glitter
of
a
diamond
than
as
the
perfume
of
a
rose
in
spite
of
his
crooked
sickly
little
body
pope
lived
to
be
and
one
evening
in
may
he
died
peacefully
in
his
home
at
twickenham
and
was
buried
in
the
church
there
near
the
monument
which
he
had
put
up
to
the
memory
of
his
father
and
mother
there
is
so
much
disagreeable
and
mean
in
pope
that
we
are
apt
to
lose
sight
of
what
was
good
in
him
altogether
we
have
to
remind
ourselves
that
he
was
a
good
and
affectionate
son
and
that
he
was
loving
to
the
friends
with
whom
he
did
not
quarrel
yet
these
can
hardly
be
counted
as
great
merits
perhaps
his
greatest
merit
is
that
he
kept
his
independence
in
an
age
when
writers
fawned
upon
patrons
or
accepted
bribes
from
whig
or
tory
pope
held
on
his
own
way
looking
for
favors
neither
from
one
side
nor
from
the
other
and
when
we
think
of
his
frail
little
body
this
sturdy
independence
of
mind
is
all
the
more
wonderful
from
pope
we
date
the
beginning
of
the
time
when
a
writer
could
live
honorable
by
his
pen
and
had
not
need
to
flatter
a
patron
or
sell
his
genius
to
politics
or
party
but
pope
stood
alone
in
this
independence
and
he
never
had
to
fight
for
it
a
happy
chance
we
might
say
made
him
free
for
while
his
brother
writers
all
around
him
were
still
held
in
the
chains
of
patronage
pope
having
more
money
than
some
did
not
need
to
bow
to
it
and
having
less
greed
than
others
did
not
choose
to
bow
to
it
in
order
to
add
to
his
wealth
and
in
the
following
chapter
we
come
to
another
man
who
in
the
next
generation
fought
for
freedom
won
it
and
thereby
helped
to
free
others

man

lxviii
johnson
days
of
struggle
samuel
johnson
was
the
son
of
a
country
bookseller
and
he
was
born
at
lichfield
in
he
was
a
big
strong
boy
but
he
suffered
from
a
dreadful
disease
known
then
as
the
king
evil
it
left
scars
upon
his
face
and
nearly
robbed
him
of
his
eyesight
in
those
days
people
still
believed
that
this
dreadful
disease
would
be
cured
if
the
person
suffering
from
it
was
touched
by
a
royal
hand
so
when
he
was
two
little
samuel
was
taken
to
london
by
his
father
and
mother
and
there
he
was
touched
by
queen
anne
samuel
had
a
wonderful
memory
and
although
he
had
been
so
young
at
the
time
all
his
life
after
he
kept
a
kind
of
awed
remembrance
of
a
stately
lady
who
wore
a
long
black
hood
and
sparkling
diamonds
the
touch
of
the
queen
soft
white
hand
did
the
poor
little
sick
child
no
good
and
it
is
quaint
to
remember
that
the
great
learned
doctor
thought
it
might
be
because
he
had
been
touched
by
the
wrong
royal
hand
he
might
have
been
cured
perhaps
had
he
been
taken
to
rome
and
touched
by
the
hand
of
a
stuart
for
johnson
was
a
tory
and
all
his
life
he
remained
at
heart
a
jacobite
at
school
samuel
learned
easily
and
read
greedily
all
kinds
of
books
he
loved
poetry
most
and
read
shakespeare
when
he
was
so
young
that
he
was
frightened
at
finding
himself
alone
while
reading
about
the
ghost
in
hamlet
yet
he
was
idle
at
his
tasks
and
had
not
altogether
an
easy
time
for
when
asked
long
years
after
how
he
became
such
a
splendid
latin
scholar
he
replied
my
master
whipt
me
very
well
without
that
sir
i
should
have
done
nothing
samuel
learned
so
easily
that
though
he
was
idle
he
knew
more
than
any
of
the
other
boys
he
ruled
them
too
three
of
them
used
to
come
every
morning
to
carry
their
stout
comrade
to
school
johnson
mounted
on
the
back
of
one
and
the
other
two
supported
him
one
on
each
side
in
winter
when
he
was
too
lazy
to
skate
or
slide
himself
they
pulled
him
about
on
the
ice
by
a
garter
tied
round
his
waist
thus
early
did
johnson
show
his
power
over
his
fellows
at
sixteen
samuel
left
school
and
for
two
years
idled
about
his
father
shop
reading
everything
that
came
in
his
way
he
devoured
books
he
did
not
read
them
carefully
but
quickly
tearing
the
heart
out
of
them
he
cared
for
nothing
else
but
reading
and
once
when
his
father
was
ill
and
unable
to
attend
to
his
bookstall
he
asked
his
son
to
do
it
for
him
samuel
refused
but
the
memory
of
his
disobedience
and
unkindliness
stayed
with
him
and
more
than
fifty
years
after
as
an
old
and
worn
man
he
stood
in
the
wind
and
rain
for
an
hour
in
the
upon
the
spot
where
his
father
stall
had
stood
this
he
did
as
a
penance
for
that
one
act
of
disobedience
johnson
father
was
a
bookworm
like
his
son
rather
than
a
tradesman
he
knew
and
loved
his
books
but
he
made
little
money
by
them
a
student
himself
he
was
proud
of
his
studious
boy
and
wanted
to
send
him
to
college
but
he
was
miserably
poor
and
could
not
afford
it
a
friend
however
offered
to
help
and
so
at
eighteen
samuel
went
to
oxford
here
he
remained
three
years
those
years
were
not
altogether
happy
ones
for
johnson
huge
ungainly
figure
and
shabby
patched
clothes
were
matters
for
laughter
among
his
students
he
became
a
sloven
in
his
dress
his
gown
was
tattered
and
his
linen
dirty
and
his
toes
showed
through
his
boots
yet
when
some
one
meaning
no
doubt
to
be
kind
placed
a
new
pair
at
his
door
he
kicked
them
away
in
anger
he
would
not
stoop
to
accept
charity
but
in
spite
of
his
poverty
and
shabby
clothes
he
was
a
leader
at
college
as
he
had
been
at
school
and
might
often
be
seen
at
his
college
gates
with
a
crowd
of
young
men
round
him
entertaining
them
with
wit
and
keeping
them
from
their
studies
after
remaining
about
three
years
at
college
johnson
left
without
taking
a
degree
perhaps
poverty
had
something
to
do
with
that
at
any
rate
with
a
great
deal
of
strange
unordered
learning
and
no
degree
and
with
his
fortune
still
to
make
samuel
returned
to
his
home
there
in
a
few
months
the
father
died
leaving
to
his
son
an
inheritance
of
forty
pounds
with
forty
pounds
not
much
is
to
be
done
and
samuel
became
an
usher
or
in
a
school
he
was
little
fitted
to
teach
and
the
months
which
followed
were
to
him
a
torture
and
all
his
life
after
he
looked
back
on
them
with
something
of
horror
after
a
few
months
he
left
the
school
where
he
had
been
so
unhappy
and
went
to
birmingham
to
be
near
an
old
schoolfellow
here
he
managed
to
live
somehow
doing
odd
bits
of
writing
and
here
he
met
the
lady
who
became
his
wife
johnson
was
now
and
a
figure
he
was
tall
and
lank
and
his
huge
bones
seemed
to
start
out
of
his
lean
body
his
face
was
deeply
marked
with
scars
and
although
he
was
very
his
gray
eyes
were
bright
and
wild
so
wild
at
times
that
they
frightened
those
upon
whom
they
were
turned
he
wore
his
own
hair
which
was
coarse
and
straight
and
in
an
age
when
every
man
wore
a
wig
this
made
him
look
absurd
he
had
a
trick
of
making
queer
gestures
with
hands
and
feet
he
would
shake
his
head
and
roll
himself
about
and
would
mutter
to
himself
until
strangers
though
that
he
was
an
idiot
and
this
queer
genius
fell
in
love
with
a
widow
lady
more
than
twenty
years
older
than
himself
she
we
are
told
was
coarse
fat
and
unlovely
but
she
was
not
without
brains
for
she
saw
beneath
the
strange
outside
of
her
young
lover
this
is
the
most
sensible
man
that
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
she
said
after
talking
with
him
so
this
strange
couple
married
sir
said
johnson
afterwards
it
was
a
on
both
sides
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
samuel
loved
his
wife
devotedly
while
she
lived
and
treasured
her
memory
tenderly
after
her
death
johnson
had
a
little
money
and
so
samuel
returned
to
his
native
town
and
there
opened
a
school
an
advertisement
appeared
in
the
papers
at
edial
near
lichfield
in
staffordshire
young
gentlemen
are
boarded
and
taught
the
latin
and
greek
languages
by
samuel
johnson
but
johnson
was
quite
unfitted
to
be
a
teacher
and
the
school
did
not
prosper
his
schoolroom
says
another
writer
must
have
resembled
an
ogre
den
and
only
two
or
three
boys
came
to
it
among
them
was
david
garrick
who
afterwards
became
a
famous
actor
and
amused
the
world
by
imitating
his
friend
and
old
schoolmaster
the
great
sam
as
well
as
his
elderly
wife
after
struggling
with
his
school
for
more
than
a
year
johnson
resolved
to
give
it
up
and
go
to
london
there
to
seek
his
fortune
leaving
his
wife
at
lichfield
he
set
off
with
his
friend
and
pupil
david
garrick
as
he
afterwards
said
with
twopence
halfpenny
in
my
pocket
and
thou
davy
with
three
halfpence
in
thine
the
days
of
the
later
stuarts
and
the
first
of
the
georges
were
the
great
days
of
patronage
when
a
writer
of
genius
appeared
noblemen
and
others
who
were
powerful
and
wealthy
were
eager
to
become
his
patron
and
have
his
books
dedicated
to
them
so
although
the
dunces
among
writers
remained
terribly
poor
almost
every
man
of
genius
was
sure
of
a
comfortable
life
but
although
he
gained
this
by
his
writing
it
was
not
because
the
people
liked
his
books
but
because
one
man
liked
them
or
was
eager
to
have
his
name
upon
them
and
therefore
became
his
patron
the
patron
then
either
himself
helped
his
pet
writer
or
got
for
him
some
government
employment
after
a
time
this
fashion
ceased
and
instead
of
taking
his
book
to
a
patron
a
writer
took
it
to
a
bookseller
and
sold
it
to
him
for
as
much
money
as
he
could
and
so
began
the
modern
way
of
publishing
books
but
when
johnson
came
to
london
to
try
his
fortune
as
a
writer
it
was
just
the
time
between
the
patron
had
not
quite
vanished
the
bookseller
had
not
yet
taken
his
place
never
had
writing
been
more
badly
paid
never
had
it
been
more
difficult
to
make
a
living
by
it
the
trade
of
author
was
at
about
one
of
its
lowest
ebbs
when
johnson
embarked
on
it
johnson
had
brought
with
him
to
london
a
tragedy
more
than
half
written
but
when
he
took
it
to
the
booksellers
they
showed
no
eagerness
to
publish
it
or
indeed
anything
else
that
he
might
write
looking
at
him
they
saw
no
genius
but
only
a
huge
and
uncouth
country
youth
one
bookseller
seeing
his
great
body
advised
him
rather
to
try
his
luck
as
a
porter
than
as
a
writer
but
in
spite
of
rebuffs
and
disappointments
johnson
would
not
give
in
when
he
had
money
enough
he
lived
in
mean
lodgings
when
he
had
none
hungry
ragged
and
cold
he
roamed
about
the
streets
making
friends
with
other
strange
forlorn
men
of
genius
and
sharing
their
miseries
but
if
johnson
starved
he
never
cringed
and
once
when
a
bookseller
spoke
rudely
to
him
he
knocked
him
down
with
one
of
his
own
books
a
beggar
or
not
johnson
demanded
the
respect
due
to
a
man
at
school
and
college
he
had
dominated
his
fellows
he
dominated
now
but
the
need
of
fighting
for
respect
made
him
rough
and
ever
after
his
manner
with
friend
and
foe
alike
was
rude
and
brusque
the
misery
of
this
time
was
such
that
long
years
after
johnson
burst
into
tears
at
the
memory
of
it
but
it
did
not
conquer
him
he
conquered
it
he
got
work
to
do
at
last
and
became
one
of
the
first
newspaper
reporters
nowadays
during
the
debates
in
parliament
there
are
numbers
of
newspaper
reporters
who
take
down
all
that
is
said
in
shorthand
and
who
afterwards
write
out
the
debates
for
their
various
newspapers
in
johnson
day
no
such
thing
had
been
thought
of
he
did
not
hear
the
debates
but
wrote
his
accounts
of
them
from
a
few
notes
given
to
him
by
some
one
who
had
heard
them
the
speeches
which
appeared
in
the
paper
were
thus
really
johnson
and
had
very
little
resemblance
to
what
had
been
said
in
the
house
and
being
a
tory
johnson
took
good
care
as
he
afterwards
confessed
that
the
whig
dogs
should
not
have
the
best
of
it
after
a
time
however
johnson
began
to
think
this
reporting
was
not
quite
honest
and
gave
it
up
he
found
other
literary
work
to
do
and
soon
although
he
was
still
poor
he
had
enough
money
to
make
it
possible
for
his
wife
to
join
him
in
london
among
other
things
he
wrote
one
or
two
poems
and
the
life
of
richard
savage
a
strange
wild
genius
with
whom
he
had
wandered
the
streets
in
the
days
of
his
worst
poverty
the
tragedy
called
irene
which
johnson
had
brought
with
him
to
london
was
at
length
after
twelve
years
produced
by
garrick
who
had
by
that
time
become
a
famous
actor
johnson
had
however
no
dramatic
genius
when
johnson
writes
tragedy
said
garrick
roars
and
passion
sleeps
when
shakespeare
wrote
he
dipped
the
pen
in
his
own
heart
garrick
did
what
he
could
with
the
play
but
it
was
a
failure
and
although
johnson
continued
to
believe
that
it
was
good
he
wrote
no
more
tragedies
is
here
quoting
from
one
of
johnson
own
poems
in
which
he
describes
the
decline
of
the
drama
at
the
restoration
the
story
of
irene
is
one
of
the
fall
of
constantinople
in
after
mahomet
had
taken
constantinople
he
fell
in
love
with
a
fair
greek
maiden
whose
name
was
irene
the
sultan
begged
her
to
become
a
mohammedan
so
that
he
might
marry
her
to
this
irene
consented
but
when
his
soldiers
heard
of
it
they
were
so
angry
that
they
formed
a
conspiracy
to
dethrone
their
ruler
hearing
of
this
mahomet
resolved
to
make
an
end
of
the
conspiracy
and
rescue
his
throne
from
danger
calling
all
his
nobles
together
he
bade
irene
appear
before
him
then
catching
her
by
the
hair
with
one
hand
and
drawing
his
sword
with
the
other
he
at
one
blow
struck
off
her
head
this
deed
filled
all
who
saw
it
with
terror
and
wonder
but
turning
to
his
nobles
mahomet
cried
now
by
this
judge
if
your
emperor
is
able
to
bridle
his
affections
or
not
it
seems
as
if
there
were
here
a
story
which
might
be
made
to
stir
our
hearts
but
johnson
makes
it
merely
dull
in
his
long
words
and
sentences
we
catch
no
thrill
of
real
life
the
play
is
artificial
and
cold
and
moves
us
neither
to
wonder
nor
sorrow
johnson
play
was
a
failure
but
by
that
time
he
had
begun
the
great
work
which
was
to
name
him
and
single
him
out
from
the
rest
of
the
world
as
dictionary
johnson
to
make
a
complete
dictionary
of
a
language
is
a
tremendous
work
johnson
thought
that
it
would
take
three
years
it
took
instead
seven
but
during
these
seven
years
he
also
wrote
other
things
and
steadily
added
to
his
fame
he
started
a
paper
after
the
model
of
the
spectator
called
the
rambler
this
paper
was
continued
for
about
two
years
johnson
writing
all
but
five
of
the
essays
after
that
he
wrote
many
essays
in
a
paper
called
the
adventurer
and
later
still
for
two
years
he
wrote
for
another
paper
a
series
of
articles
called
the
idler
but
none
of
these
can
we
compare
with
the
spectator
johnson
never
for
a
moment
loses
sight
of
a
grand
moral
end
there
is
in
his
essays
much
sound
common
sense
but
they
are
lumbering
and
heavy
we
get
from
them
no
such
picture
of
the
times
as
we
get
from
the
spectator
and
although
they
are
not
altogether
without
humor
it
is
a
humor
that
not
seldom
reminds
us
of
the
dancing
of
an
elephant
this
is
partly
because
as
johnson
said
himself
he
is
inclined
to
use
too
big
words
and
too
many
of
them
in
the
days
when
johnson
wrote
this
style
was
greatly
admired
but
now
we
have
come
back
to
thinking
that
the
simplest
words
are
best
or
at
least
that
we
must
suit
our
words
to
our
subject
and
if
we
tell
a
fairy
tale
as
johnson
once
did
we
must
not
use
words
of
five
syllables
when
words
of
two
will
better
give
the
feeling
of
the
tale
yet
there
are
many
pleasant
to
be
spent
in
dipping
here
and
there
into
the
volumes
of
the
rambler
or
the
idler
i
will
give
you
in
the
next
chapter
as
a
specimen
of
johnson
prose
part
of
one
of
the
essays
from
the
idler
it
is
the
story
of
a
man
who
sets
forth
upon
a
very
ordinary
journey
and
who
makes
as
great
a
tale
of
it
as
he
had
been
upon
a
voyage
of
discovery
in
some
untraveled
land
chapter
lxix
johnson
the
end
of
the
journey
i
supped
three
nights
ago
with
my
friend
will
marvel
his
affairs
obliged
him
lately
to
take
a
journey
into
devonshire
from
which
he
has
just
returned
he
knows
me
to
be
a
very
patient
hearer
and
was
glad
of
my
company
as
it
gave
him
an
opportunity
of
disburdening
himself
by
a
minute
relation
of
the
casualties
of
his
expedition
will
is
not
one
of
those
who
go
out
and
return
with
nothing
to
tell
he
has
a
story
of
his
travels
which
will
strike
a
bred
citizen
with
horror
and
has
in
ten
days
suffered
so
often
the
extremes
of
terror
and
joy
that
he
is
in
doubt
whether
he
shall
ever
again
expose
either
his
body
or
his
mind
to
such
danger
and
fatigue
when
he
left
london
the
morning
was
bright
and
a
fair
day
was
promised
but
will
is
born
to
struggle
with
difficulties
that
happened
to
him
which
has
sometimes
perhaps
happened
to
others
before
he
had
gone
more
than
ten
miles
it
began
to
rain
what
course
was
to
be
taken
his
soul
disdained
to
turn
back
he
did
what
the
king
of
prussia
might
have
done
he
flapped
his
hat
buttoned
up
his
cape
and
went
forwards
fortifying
his
mind
by
the
stoical
consolation
that
whatever
is
violent
will
be
short
so
with
such
adventures
the
first
day
passes
and
reaching
his
inn
after
a
good
supper
will
marvel
goes
to
bed
and
sleeps
soundly
but
during
the
night
he
is
wakened
by
a
shower
beating
against
his
windows
with
such
violence
as
to
threaten
the
dissolution
of
nature
thus
he
knows
that
the
next
day
will
have
its
troubles
he
joined
himself
however
to
a
company
that
was
travelling
the
same
way
and
came
safely
to
the
place
of
dinner
though
every
step
of
his
horse
dashed
the
mud
in
the
air
in
the
afternoon
he
went
on
alone
passing
collections
of
water
puddles
doubtless
the
depth
of
which
it
was
impossible
to
guess
and
looking
back
upon
the
ride
he
marvels
at
his
rash
daring
but
what
a
man
undertakes
he
must
perform
and
marvel
hates
a
coward
at
his
heart
few
that
lie
warm
in
their
beds
think
what
others
undergo
who
have
perhaps
been
as
tenderly
educated
and
have
as
acute
sensations
as
themselves
my
friend
was
now
to
lodge
the
second
night
almost
fifty
miles
from
home
in
a
house
which
he
never
had
seen
before
among
people
to
whom
he
was
totally
a
stranger
not
knowing
whether
the
next
man
he
should
meet
would
prove
good
or
bad
but
seeing
an
inn
of
a
good
appearance
he
rode
resolutely
into
the
yard
and
knowing
that
respect
is
often
paid
in
proportion
as
it
is
claimed
delivered
his
injunctions
to
the
ostler
with
spirit
and
entering
the
house
called
vigorously
about
him
on
the
third
day
up
rose
the
sun
and
marvel
his
troubles
and
dangers
were
now
such
as
he
wishes
no
other
man
ever
to
encounter
the
way
was
lonely
often
for
two
miles
together
he
met
not
a
single
soul
with
whom
he
could
speak
and
looking
at
the
bleak
fields
and
naked
trees
he
wished
himself
safe
home
again
his
only
consolation
was
that
he
suffered
these
terrors
of
the
way
alone
had
for
instance
his
friend
the
idler
been
there
he
could
have
done
nothing
but
lie
down
and
die
at
last
the
sun
set
and
all
the
horrors
of
darkness
came
upon
him
yet
he
went
forward
along
a
path
which
he
could
no
longer
see
sometimes
rushing
suddenly
into
water
and
sometimes
encumbered
with
stiff
clay
ignorant
whither
he
was
going
and
uncertain
whether
his
next
step
might
not
be
the
last
in
this
dismal
gloom
of
nocturnal
peregrination
his
horse
unexpectedly
stood
still
marvel
had
heard
many
relations
of
the
instinct
of
horses
and
was
in
doubt
what
danger
might
be
at
hand
sometimes
he
fancied
that
he
was
on
the
bank
of
a
river
still
and
deep
and
sometimes
that
a
dead
body
lay
across
the
track
he
sat
still
awhile
to
recollect
his
thoughts
and
as
he
was
about
to
alight
and
explore
the
darkness
out
stepped
a
man
with
a
lantern
and
opened
the
turnpike
he
hired
a
guide
to
the
town
arrived
in
safety
and
slept
in
quiet
the
rest
of
his
journey
was
nothing
but
danger
he
climbed
and
descended
precipices
on
which
vulgar
mortals
tremble
to
look
he
passed
marshes
like
the
serbonian
bog
where
armies
whole
have
sunk
he
forded
rivers
where
the
current
roared
like
the
egre
or
the
severn
or
ventured
himself
on
bridges
that
trembled
under
him
from
which
he
looked
down
on
foaming
whirlpools
or
dreadful
abysses
he
wandered
over
houseless
heaths
amidst
all
the
rage
of
the
elements
with
the
snow
driving
in
his
face
and
the
tempest
howling
in
his
ears
serbonis
in
egypt
sand
being
blown
over
it
by
the
winds
gave
it
the
appearance
of
solid
ground
whereas
it
was
a
bog
a
gulf
profound
as
the
serbonian
bog
where
armies
whole
have
sunk
milton
such
are
the
colours
in
which
marvel
paints
his
adventures
he
has
accustomed
himself
to
sounding
words
and
hyperbolical
images
till
he
has
lost
the
power
of
true
description
in
a
road
through
which
the
heaviest
carriages
pass
without
difficulty
and
the
every
day
and
night
goes
and
returns
he
meets
with
hardships
like
those
which
are
endured
in
siberian
deserts
and
missed
nothing
of
romantic
danger
but
a
giant
and
a
dragon
when
his
dreadful
story
is
told
in
proper
terms
it
is
only
that
the
way
was
dirty
in
winter
and
that
he
experienced
the
common
vicissitudes
of
rain
and
sunshine
i
am
afraid
you
will
find
a
good
many
too
big
words
in
that
but
if
i
changed
them
to
others
more
simple
you
would
get
no
idea
of
the
way
in
which
johnson
wrote
and
i
hope
those
you
do
not
understand
you
will
look
up
in
the
dictionary
it
will
not
be
johnson
own
dictionary
however
for
that
has
grown
fashioned
and
its
place
has
been
taken
by
later
ones
for
some
of
johnson
meanings
were
not
correct
and
when
these
mistakes
were
pointed
out
to
him
he
was
not
in
the
least
ashamed
once
a
lady
asked
him
how
he
came
to
say
that
the
pastern
was
the
knee
of
a
horse
and
he
calmly
replied
ignorance
madam
pure
ignorance
dictionaries
are
like
watches
he
said
the
worst
is
better
than
none
and
the
best
can
not
be
expected
to
go
quite
true
with
some
words
instead
of
giving
the
original
meaning
he
gave
a
personal
meaning
that
is
he
allowed
his
own
sense
of
humor
feelings
or
politics
to
color
the
meaning
for
instance
he
disliked
the
scots
so
for
the
meaning
of
oats
he
gave
a
grain
which
in
england
is
generally
given
to
horses
but
in
scotland
supports
the
people
he
disliked
the
excise
duty
so
he
called
it
a
hateful
tax
levied
by
wretches
hired
by
those
to
whom
excise
is
paid
for
this
last
meaning
he
came
very
near
being
punished
for
libel
when
johnson
thought
of
beginning
the
dictionary
he
wrote
about
it
to
lord
chesterfield
a
great
man
and
fine
gentleman
of
the
day
as
the
fashion
was
johnson
had
chosen
this
great
man
for
his
patron
but
lord
chesterfield
although
his
vanity
was
flattered
at
the
idea
of
having
a
book
dedicated
to
him
was
too
delicate
a
fine
gentleman
to
wish
to
have
anything
to
do
with
a
man
he
considered
poor
he
throws
anywhere
but
down
his
throat
he
said
whatever
he
means
to
drink
and
mangles
what
he
means
to
carve
the
utmost
i
can
do
for
him
is
to
consider
him
a
respectable
hottentot
so
when
johnson
had
called
several
times
and
been
told
that
his
lordship
was
not
at
home
or
had
been
kept
waiting
for
hours
before
he
was
received
he
grew
angry
and
marched
away
never
to
return
vowing
that
he
had
done
with
patrons
for
ever
the
years
went
on
and
johnson
saw
nothing
of
his
patron
when
however
the
dictionary
was
nearly
done
lord
chesterfield
let
it
be
known
that
he
would
be
pleased
to
have
it
dedicated
to
him
but
johnson
would
have
none
of
it
he
wrote
a
letter
which
was
the
blast
of
doom
proclaiming
into
the
ear
of
lord
chesterfield
and
through
him
of
the
listening
world
that
patronage
would
be
no
more
seven
years
my
lord
have
now
passed
wrote
johnson
since
i
waited
in
your
outward
rooms
and
was
repulsed
from
your
door
during
which
time
i
have
been
pushing
on
my
work
through
difficulties
of
which
it
is
useless
to
complain
and
have
brought
it
at
last
to
the
verge
of
publication
without
one
act
of
assistance
one
word
of
encouragement
and
one
smile
of
favour
such
treatment
i
did
not
expect
for
i
never
had
a
patron
before
is
not
a
patron
my
lord
one
who
looks
with
unconcern
on
a
man
struggling
for
life
in
the
water
and
when
he
has
reached
the
ground
cumbers
him
with
help
the
notice
which
you
have
been
pleased
to
take
of
my
labours
had
it
been
early
had
been
kind
but
it
has
been
delayed
till
i
am
indifferent
and
can
not
enjoy
it
till
i
am
solitary
and
can
not
impart
it
till
i
am
known
and
do
not
want
it
there
was
an
end
of
patronage
so
far
as
johnson
was
concerned
and
it
was
the
beginning
of
the
end
of
it
with
others
great
sam
had
roared
he
had
asserted
himself
and
with
the
publication
of
his
dictionary
he
became
the
great
of
literature
tartar
word
for
prince
or
chief
he
had
by
this
time
founded
a
club
of
literary
men
which
met
at
a
famous
house
and
here
he
lorded
it
over
his
fellows
as
his
bulky
namesake
had
done
more
than
a
hundred
years
before
in
many
ways
there
was
a
great
likeness
between
these
two
they
were
both
big
and
stout
for
sam
was
now
stout
they
were
and
dictatorial
they
both
drank
a
great
deal
but
ben
alas
drank
wine
overmuch
as
was
common
in
his
day
while
sam
drank
endless
cups
of
tea
seventeen
or
eighteen
it
might
be
at
a
sitting
indeed
he
called
himself
a
hardened
and
shameless
but
above
all
their
likeness
lies
in
the
fact
that
they
both
dominated
the
literary
men
of
their
period
they
were
kings
and
rulers
they
laid
down
the
law
and
settled
who
was
great
and
who
little
among
the
writers
of
the
day
and
it
was
not
merely
the
friends
around
johnson
who
heard
him
talk
who
listened
to
his
judgments
about
books
and
writers
the
world
outside
listened
too
to
what
he
had
to
say
and
you
will
remember
that
it
was
he
who
utterly
condemned
pretended
poems
of
ossian
that
pious
fraud
of
which
you
have
already
read
in
chapter
iv
lang
johnson
had
always
spent
much
of
his
time
in
taverns
and
was
now
more
than
ever
free
to
do
so
for
while
he
was
still
working
at
his
dictionary
he
suffered
a
great
grief
in
the
death
of
his
wife
he
had
loved
her
truly
and
never
ceased
to
mourn
her
loss
but
though
he
had
lost
his
wife
he
did
not
remain
solitary
in
his
home
for
he
opened
his
doors
to
a
queer
collection
of
waifs
and
strays
three
women
and
a
man
upon
whom
he
took
pity
because
no
one
else
would
they
were
ungrateful
and
undeserving
and
quarreled
constantly
among
themselves
so
that
his
home
could
have
been
no
peaceful
spot
williams
hates
everybody
he
writes
levett
hates
desmoulins
and
does
not
love
williams
desmoulins
hates
them
both
poll
loves
none
of
them
it
does
not
sound
peaceful
or
happy
some
years
after
the
death
of
johnson
wife
his
mother
died
at
the
age
of
ninety
and
although
he
had
not
been
with
her
for
many
years
that
too
was
a
grief
the
poor
lady
had
had
very
little
to
live
on
and
she
left
some
debts
johnson
himself
was
still
struggling
with
poverty
he
had
no
money
so
to
pay
his
few
debts
and
also
the
expenses
of
her
funeral
he
sat
down
to
write
a
story
in
a
week
he
had
finished
rasselas
prince
of
abyssinia
the
story
of
rasselas
is
that
of
a
prince
who
is
shut
up
in
the
happy
valley
until
the
time
shall
come
for
him
to
ascent
the
throne
of
his
father
everything
was
done
to
make
life
in
the
happy
valley
peaceful
and
joyful
but
rasselas
grew
weary
of
it
to
him
it
became
but
a
prison
of
pleasure
and
at
last
with
his
favorite
sister
he
escaped
out
into
the
world
the
story
tells
then
of
their
search
for
happiness
but
perfect
happiness
they
can
not
find
and
discovering
this
they
decide
to
return
to
the
happy
valley
there
is
a
vein
of
sadness
throughout
the
book
it
ends
as
it
were
with
a
big
question
mark
with
a
conclusion
in
which
nothing
is
concluded
for
the
position
of
the
prince
and
his
sister
was
unchanged
and
they
had
not
found
what
they
sought
is
it
to
be
found
at
all
the
story
is
a
revelation
of
johnson
himself
he
never
saw
life
joyously
and
at
times
he
had
fits
of
deep
melancholy
which
he
fought
against
as
against
a
madness
i
inherited
he
said
a
vile
melancholy
from
my
father
which
has
made
me
mad
all
my
life
at
least
not
sober
and
his
long
struggle
with
poverty
helped
to
deepen
this
melancholy
but
a
year
or
two
after
rasselas
was
written
a
great
change
came
in
johnson
life
which
gave
him
comfort
and
security
for
the
rest
of
his
days
george
iii
had
come
to
the
throne
he
thought
that
he
would
like
to
do
something
for
literature
and
offered
johnson
a
pension
of
three
hundred
pounds
a
year
johnson
was
now
a
man
of
he
was
acknowledged
as
the
greatest
man
of
letters
of
his
day
yet
he
was
still
poor
three
hundred
pounds
seemed
to
him
wealth
but
he
hesitated
to
accept
it
he
was
an
ardent
tory
and
hated
the
house
of
hanover
in
his
dictionary
he
had
called
a
pension
an
allowance
made
to
any
one
without
an
equivalent
in
england
it
is
generally
understood
to
mean
pay
given
to
a
state
hireling
for
treason
to
his
country
a
pensioner
he
had
said
was
a
slave
of
state
hired
by
a
stipend
to
obey
his
master
was
he
then
to
become
a
traitor
to
his
country
and
a
slave
of
state
but
after
a
little
persuasion
johnson
yielded
as
the
pension
would
be
given
to
him
he
was
told
not
for
anything
that
he
would
do
but
for
what
he
had
done
it
is
true
he
said
afterwards
with
a
smile
that
i
can
not
now
curse
the
house
of
hanover
nor
would
it
be
decent
for
me
to
drink
king
health
in
the
wine
that
king
george
gives
me
money
to
pay
for
but
sir
i
think
that
the
pleasure
of
cursing
the
house
of
hanover
and
drinking
king
james
health
are
amply
overbalanced
by
three
hundred
pounds
a
year
johnson
had
always
been
indolent
it
was
perhaps
only
poverty
that
had
forced
him
to
write
and
now
that
he
was
comfortably
provided
for
he
became
more
indolent
still
he
reproached
himself
made
good
resolutions
and
prayed
over
this
fault
but
still
he
remained
slothful
and
idle
he
would
lie
abed
till
two
and
sit
up
half
the
night
talking
and
an
edition
of
shakespeare
which
he
had
promised
years
before
got
no
further
on
an
edition
of
another
man
works
often
means
a
great
deal
of
labor
in
making
notes
and
comments
this
is
especially
so
if
hundreds
of
years
have
passed
since
the
book
was
first
written
and
the
language
has
had
time
to
change
and
johnson
felt
little
inclined
for
this
labor
but
at
length
he
was
goaded
into
working
upon
his
shakespeare
by
some
spiteful
verses
on
his
idleness
written
by
a
political
enemy
and
after
long
delay
it
appeared
just
a
little
before
this
a
young
scotsman
named
james
boswell
got
to
know
the
great
man
he
worshiped
johnson
and
spent
as
much
time
with
him
as
he
could
it
was
a
strange
friendship
which
grew
up
between
these
two
the
great
man
bullied
and
insulted
yet
loved
the
little
man
and
the
little
man
accepted
all
the
insults
gladly
happy
to
be
allowed
to
be
near
his
hero
on
any
conditions
whatever
he
treasured
every
word
that
johnson
spoke
and
noted
his
every
action
nothing
was
too
small
or
trivial
for
his
loving
observation
he
asked
johnson
questions
and
made
remarks
foolish
or
otherwise
in
order
to
draw
him
out
and
make
him
talk
and
afterwards
he
set
down
everything
in
a
notebook
and
when
johnson
was
dead
boswell
wrote
his
life
it
is
one
of
the
most
wonderful
lives
ever
written
perhaps
the
most
wonderful
and
when
we
have
read
it
we
seem
to
know
johnson
as
well
as
if
we
had
lived
with
him
we
see
and
know
him
in
all
his
greatness
and
all
his
littleness
in
all
his
weakness
and
all
his
might
it
was
with
boswell
that
johnson
made
his
most
famous
journey
his
tour
to
scotland
for
like
his
namesake
ben
he
too
visited
scotland
but
he
traveled
in
a
more
comfortable
manner
and
his
journey
was
a
much
longer
one
for
he
went
as
far
as
the
hebrides
it
was
a
wonderful
expedition
for
a
man
of
especially
in
those
days
when
there
were
no
trains
and
little
ease
in
the
way
of
traveling
and
when
much
of
it
had
to
be
done
on
rough
ponies
or
in
open
boats
on
his
return
johnson
wrote
an
account
of
this
journey
which
did
not
altogether
please
some
of
the
scots
but
indeed
although
johnson
did
not
love
the
scots
there
is
little
in
his
book
at
which
to
take
offense
johnson
last
work
was
a
series
of
short
lives
of
some
of
the
english
poets
from
the
seventeenth
century
onwards
it
is
generally
looked
upon
as
his
best
and
although
some
of
the
poets
of
whom
he
wrote
are
almost
forgotten
and
although
we
may
think
that
he
was
wrong
in
his
criticisms
of
many
of
the
others
this
is
the
book
of
johnson
which
is
still
most
read
for
it
must
be
owned
that
the
great
sam
is
not
much
read
now
although
he
is
such
an
important
figure
in
the
history
of
our
literature
it
is
as
a
person
that
we
remember
him
not
as
a
writer
he
stamped
his
personality
as
it
is
called
upon
his
age
boswell
caught
that
personality
and
preserved
it
for
us
so
that
for
generation
after
generation
johnson
lives
as
no
other
character
in
english
literature
lives
boswell
gave
a
new
meaning
to
the
word
biographer
that
is
the
writer
of
a
life
and
now
when
a
great
man
has
had
no
one
to
write
his
life
well
we
say
he
lacks
a
boswell
boswell
after
a
time
joined
the
famous
club
at
which
johnson
and
his
friends
met
together
and
talked
johnson
loved
to
argue
and
he
made
a
point
of
always
getting
the
best
of
an
argument
if
he
could
not
do
so
by
reason
he
simply
roared
his
opponent
down
and
silenced
him
by
sheer
rudeness
there
is
no
arguing
with
johnson
said
one
of
his
friends
oliver
goldsmith
for
when
his
pistol
misses
fire
he
knocks
you
down
with
the
butt
end
of
it
and
perhaps
goldy
as
johnson
called
him
had
to
suffer
more
rudeness
from
him
than
any
of
his
friends
to
save
bozzy
yet
the
three
were
often
to
be
found
together
and
it
was
goldsmith
who
said
of
johnson
no
man
alive
has
a
more
tender
heart
he
has
nothing
of
the
bear
but
his
skin
and
indeed
in
johnson
outward
appearance
there
was
much
of
the
bear
he
was
a
sloven
in
dress
his
clothes
were
shabby
and
thrown
on
anyhow
i
have
no
passion
for
clean
linen
he
said
himself
at
table
he
made
strange
noises
and
ate
greedily
yet
in
spite
of
all
that
added
to
his
noted
temper
and
rude
manners
men
loved
him
and
sought
his
company
more
than
that
of
any
other
writer
of
his
day
for
within
that
shaggy
exterior
of
his
there
beat
a
heart
warm
as
a
mother
soft
as
a
little
child
after
johnson
received
his
pension
we
may
look
upon
him
as
a
lumbering
vessel
which
has
weathered
many
a
strong
sea
and
has
now
safely
come
to
port
his
life
was
henceforth
easy
he
received
honorary
degrees
first
from
dublin
and
then
from
oxford
so
that
he
became
johnson
for
years
he
enjoyed
his
pension
his
freedom
and
his
honors
then
in
surrounded
by
his
friends
he
died
in
london
and
was
buried
in
westminster

lxx
goldsmith
the
vagabond
the
kind
of
book
which
is
most
written
and
read
nowadays
is
called
a
novel
but
we
have
not
yet
spoken
much
about
this
kind
of
book
for
until
now
there
were
no
novels
in
our
meaning
of
the
word
there
were
romances
such
as
havelok
the
dane
and
morte
later
still
tales
such
as
those
of
defoe
and
the
modern
novel
is
the
outcome
of
such
tales
and
romances
but
it
is
usually
supposed
to
be
more
like
real
life
than
a
romance
in
a
romance
we
may
have
giants
and
fairies
things
beyond
nature
and
above
nature
a
novel
is
supposed
to
tell
only
of
what
could
happen
without
the
help
of
anything
outside
everyday
life
this
is
a
kind
of
writing
in
which
the
english
have
become
very
clever
and
now
as
i
said
more
novels
than
any
other
kinds
of
book
are
written
but
only
a
few
of
these
are
good
enough
to
take
a
place
in
our
literature
and
very
many
are
not
worth
reading
or
remembering
at
all
the
first
real
novel
in
the
modern
sense
was
written
by
samuel
richardson
and
published
in
quickly
after
that
there
arose
several
other
novel
writers
whose
books
became
famous
these
still
stand
high
in
the
literature
of
our
land
but
as
nothing
in
them
would
be
interesting
to
you
for
many
years
to
come
we
need
not
trouble
about
them
now
there
is
however
one
novel
of
this
early
time
which
i
feel
sure
you
would
like
and
of
it
and
its
author
i
shall
tell
you
something
the
book
i
mean
is
called
the
vicar
of
wakefield
and
it
was
written
by
oliver
goldsmith
oliver
goldsmith
was
born
in
in
pallas
a
little
way
irish
village
his
father
was
a
clergyman
and
farmer
with
a
large
family
and
very
little
money
he
was
a
dear
simple
kindly
man
a
man
he
was
to
all
the
country
dear
and
passing
rich
with
forty
pounds
a
year
two
years
after
oliver
was
born
his
father
moved
to
lissoy
another
and
better
parish
little
oliver
began
to
learn
very
early
but
his
first
teacher
thought
him
stupid
never
was
there
such
a
dull
boy
she
said
she
managed
however
to
teach
him
the
alphabet
and
at
six
he
went
to
the
village
school
of
lissoy
paddy
byrne
the
master
there
was
an
old
soldier
he
had
fought
under
marlborough
he
had
wandered
the
world
seeking
and
finding
adventures
his
head
was
full
of
tales
of
wild
exploits
of
battles
of
ghosts
and
fairies
too
for
he
was
an
irishman
and
knew
and
loved
the
celtic
lore
besides
all
this
he
wrote
poetry
to
his
schoolmaster
stories
little
oliver
listened
eagerly
he
listened
too
to
the
ballads
sung
by
peggy
the
dairymaid
and
to
the
wild
music
of
the
blind
harper
turlogh
the
last
irish
minstrel
all
these
things
sank
into
the
heart
of
the
shy
little
ugly
boy
who
seemed
so
stupid
to
his
schoolfellows
he
learned
to
read
and
devoured
all
the
romances
and
tales
of
adventure
upon
which
he
could
lay
hands
and
in
imitation
of
his
schoolmaster
he
began
to
write
poetry
for
three
years
oliver
remained
under
the
care
of
his
vagabond
teacher
he
looked
up
to
him
with
a
kind
of
awed
wonder
and
many
years
afterwards
he
drew
a
picture
of
him
in
his
poem
the
deserted
village
there
in
his
noisy
mansion
skilled
to
rule
the
village
master
taught
his
little
school
a
man
severe
he
was
and
stern
to
view
i
knew
him
well
and
every
truant
knew
well
had
the
boding
tremblers
learn
to
trace
the
day
disasters
in
his
morning
face
full
well
they
laugh
with
counterfeited
glee
at
all
his
jokes
for
many
a
joke
had
he
full
well
the
busy
whisper
circlin
round
convey
the
dismal
tidings
when
he
frown
yet
he
was
kind
or
if
severe
in
aught
the
love
he
bore
to
learning
was
in
fault
the
village
all
declared
how
much
he
knew
was
certain
he
could
write
and
cypher
too
lands
he
could
measure
terms
and
tides
presage
and
the
story
ran
that
he
could
gauge
in
arguing
too
the
parson
own
his
skill
for
though
vanquish
he
could
argue
still
while
words
of
learned
length
and
sound
amazed
the
gazing
rustics
ranged
around
and
still
they
gazed
and
still
the
wonder
grew
that
one
small
head
should
carry
all
he
knew
but
after
three
years
of
school
under
wonderful
paddy
byrne
goldsmith
became
very
ill
with
smallpox
he
nearly
died
of
it
and
when
he
grew
better
he
was
plainer
than
ever
for
his
face
was
scarred
and
pitted
by
the
disease
goldsmith
had
been
shy
before
his
illness
and
now
when
people
laughed
at
his
marked
face
he
grew
more
shy
and
sensitive
still
for
the
next
seven
years
he
was
moved
about
from
school
to
school
always
looked
upon
by
his
fellows
as
dull
of
wit
but
good
at
games
and
always
in
the
forefront
in
mischief
at
length
when
goldsmith
was
nearly
seventeen
he
went
to
trinity
college
dublin
as
a
sizar
as
you
know
in
those
days
sizars
had
to
wear
a
different
dress
from
the
commoners
oliver
elder
brother
had
gone
as
a
commoner
and
oliver
had
hoped
to
do
the
same
but
as
his
father
could
not
afford
the
money
he
was
obliged
much
against
his
will
to
go
as
a
sizar
indeed
had
it
not
been
for
the
kindness
of
an
uncle
he
could
not
have
gone
to
college
at
all
awkward
and
shy
keen
to
feel
insults
whether
intended
or
not
goldsmith
hated
his
position
as
sizar
he
did
not
like
his
tutor
either
who
was
a
coarse
rough
man
so
his
life
at
college
was
not
altogether
happy
he
was
constantly
in
want
of
money
for
when
he
had
any
his
purse
was
always
open
to
others
at
times
when
he
was
much
in
need
he
wrote
street
ballads
for
five
shillings
each
and
would
steal
out
at
night
to
have
the
joy
of
hearing
them
sung
in
the
street
goldsmith
was
idle
and
wild
and
at
the
end
of
two
years
he
quarreled
with
his
tutor
sold
his
books
and
ran
away
to
cork
he
meant
to
go
on
board
a
ship
and
sail
away
for
ever
from
a
land
where
he
had
been
so
unhappy
but
he
had
little
money
and
what
he
had
was
soon
spent
and
at
last
almost
starving
having
lived
for
three
days
on
a
shilling
he
turned
homewards
again
peace
was
made
with
his
tutor
and
goldsmith
went
back
to
college
and
stayed
there
until
two
years
later
when
he
took
his
degree
his
father
was
now
dead
and
it
was
necessary
for
oliver
to
earn
his
own
living
all
his
family
wished
him
to
be
a
clergyman
but
he
did
not
deem
himself
good
enough
for
it
however
he
yielded
to
their
persuasions
and
presented
himself
to
his
bishop
but
the
bishop
would
not
ordain
him
why
is
not
known
but
it
was
said
that
he
was
offended
with
goldsmith
for
coming
to
be
ordained
dressed
in
scarlet
breeches
after
this
failure
oliver
tried
teaching
and
became
a
tutor
but
in
a
very
short
time
he
gave
that
up
next
his
uncle
thinking
that
he
would
make
a
lawyer
of
him
gave
him
pounds
and
sent
him
off
to
london
to
study
law
there
goldsmith
lost
the
money
in
dublin
and
came
home
penniless
some
time
after
this
a
gentleman
remarked
that
he
would
make
an
excellent
medical
man
and
again
his
uncle
gave
him
money
and
sent
him
off
to
edinburgh
this
time
as
a
medical
student
so
he
said
his
last
to
home
and
ireland
and
set
out
in
scotland
goldsmith
lived
for
a
year
and
a
half
traveling
about
enjoying
life
and
it
may
be
studying
then
in
his
way
he
decided
it
would
be
well
to
go
to
holland
to
finish
his
medical
studies
there
off
he
started
with
little
money
in
his
pocket
and
many
debts
behind
him
after
not
a
few
adventures
he
arrived
at
length
in
leyden
here
passing
a
florist
shop
he
saw
some
bulbs
which
he
knew
his
uncle
wanted
so
in
he
ran
to
the
shop
bought
them
and
sent
them
off
to
ireland
the
money
with
which
he
bought
the
bulbs
was
borrowed
and
now
he
left
leyden
to
make
the
tour
of
europe
burdened
already
with
debt
with
one
guinea
in
his
pocket
and
one
clean
shirt
and
a
flute
as
his
luggage
thus
on
foot
he
wandered
through
belgium
germany
switzerland
italy
and
france
in
the
villages
he
played
upon
his
flute
to
pay
for
his
food
and
his
night
lodging
yet
would
the
village
praise
my
wondrous
power
and
dance
forgetful
of
the
hour
alike
all
ages
dames
of
ancient
days
have
led
their
children
through
the
mirthful
maze
and
the
gay
grandsire
skill
in
gestic
lore
has
frisk
beneath
the
burthen
of
threescore
traveller
in
the
towns
where
no
one
listened
to
his
flute
and
in
italy
where
almost
every
peasant
played
better
than
he
he
entered
the
colleges
and
disputed
for
in
those
days
many
of
the
colleges
and
monasteries
on
the
continent
kept
certain
days
for
arguments
upon
subjects
of
philosophy
for
which
if
the
champion
opposes
with
any
dexterity
he
can
gain
a
gratuity
in
money
a
dinner
and
a
bed
for
one
night
thus
from
town
to
town
from
village
to
village
goldsmith
wandered
until
at
the
end
of
a
year
he
found
himself
back
among
his
countrymen
penniless
and
alone
in
london
streets
here
we
have
glimpses
of
him
a
sorry
figure
in
rusty
black
and
tarnished
gold
his
pockets
stuffed
with
papers
now
assisting
in
a
chemist
shop
now
practicing
as
a
doctor
among
those
as
poor
as
himself
now
struggling
to
get
a
footing
in
the
realm
of
literature
now
passing
his
days
miserably
as
an
usher
in
a
school
at
length
he
gained
more
or
less
constant
work
in
writing
magazine
articles
reviews
and
children
books
by
slow
degrees
his
name
became
known
he
met
johnson
and
became
a
member
of
his
famous
club
it
is
said
that
the
first
time
those
two
great
men
met
johnson
took
special
care
in
dressing
himself
he
put
on
a
new
suit
of
clothes
and
a
newly
powdered
wig
when
asked
by
a
friend
why
he
was
so
particular
he
replied
why
sir
i
hear
that
goldsmith
is
a
very
great
sloven
and
justifies
his
disregard
for
cleanliness
and
decency
by
quoting
my
example
i
wish
this
night
to
show
him
a
better
example
but
although
goldsmith
was
now
beginning
to
be
well
known
he
still
lived
in
poor
lodgings
he
had
only
one
chair
and
when
a
visitor
came
he
was
given
the
chair
while
oliver
sat
on
the
window
ledge
when
he
had
money
he
led
an
idle
easy
life
until
it
was
spent
he
was
always
generous
his
hand
was
always
open
to
help
others
but
he
often
forgot
to
pay
his
just
debts
at
length
one
day
his
landlady
finding
he
could
not
pay
his
rent
arrested
him
for
debt
in
great
distress
goldsmith
wrote
to
johnson
begging
him
to
come
to
his
aid
johnson
sent
him
a
guinea
promising
to
come
to
him
as
soon
as
possible
when
johnson
arrived
at
lodging
i
perceived
he
says
that
he
had
already
changed
my
guinea
and
had
got
a
bottle
of
madeira
and
a
glass
before
him
i
put
the
cork
into
the
bottle
desired
him
to
be
calm
and
began
to
talk
to
him
of
the
means
by
which
he
might
be
extricated
he
then
told
me
that
he
had
a
novel
ready
for
the
press
which
he
produced
to
me
i
looked
into
it
and
saw
its
merits
told
the
landlady
i
should
soon
return
and
having
gone
to
a
bookseller
sold
it
for
sixty
pounds
i
brought
goldsmith
the
money
and
he
discharged
his
rent
not
without
rating
his
landlady
in
high
tone
for
having
used
him
so
the
novel
which
thus
set
goldsmith
free
for
the
moment
was
the
famous
vicar
of
wakefield
there
are
an
hundred
faults
in
this
thing
says
goldsmith
himself
and
if
we
agree
with
him
there
we
also
agree
with
him
when
he
goes
on
to
say
and
an
hundred
things
might
be
said
to
prove
them
beauties
but
it
is
needless
a
book
may
be
amusing
with
numerous
errors
or
it
may
be
very
dull
without
a
single
absurdity
the
hero
of
this
piece
unites
in
himself
the
three
greatest
characters
upon
earth
he
is
a
priest
an
husbandman
and
the
father
of
a
family
he
is
drawn
as
ready
to
teach
and
ready
to
obey
as
simple
in
affluence
and
majestic
in
adversity
when
we
have
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
vicar
we
find
ourselves
the
richer
for
a
lifelong
friend
his
gentle
dignity
his
simple
faith
his
sly
and
tender
humor
all
make
us
love
him
in
the
vicar
of
wakefield
goldsmith
drew
for
us
a
picture
of
quiet
fireside
family
life
such
as
no
one
before
or
perhaps
since
has
drawn
yet
he
himself
was
a
homeless
man
since
a
boy
of
sixteen
he
had
been
a
wanderer
a
lonely
vagabond
dwelling
beneath
strange
roofs
but
it
was
the
memory
of
his
childish
days
that
made
it
possible
for
him
to
write
such
a
book
and
in
learning
to
know
and
love
gentle
primrose
we
learn
to
know
oliver
father
charles
goldsmith
chapter
lxxi
goldsmith
the
vicar
of
wakefield
i
chose
my
wife
says
primrose
in
the
beginning
of
the
book
as
she
did
her
wedding
gown
not
for
a
fine
glossy
surface
but
such
qualities
as
would
wear
well
to
do
her
justice
she
was
a
notable
woman
and
as
for
breeding
there
were
few
county
ladies
who
could
show
more
she
could
read
any
english
book
without
much
spelling
but
for
pickling
preserving
and
cooking
none
could
excel
her
she
prided
herself
also
upon
being
an
excellent
contriver
in
housekeeping
though
i
could
never
find
that
we
grew
richer
with
her
contrivances
of
his
children
he
says
our
eldest
son
was
named
george
after
his
uncle
who
left
us
ten
thousand
pounds
our
second
child
a
girl
i
intended
to
call
after
her
aunt
grissel
but
my
wife
who
had
been
reading
romances
insisted
upon
her
being
called
olivia
in
less
than
another
year
we
had
another
daughter
and
now
i
was
determined
that
grissel
should
be
her
name
but
a
rich
relation
taking
a
fancy
to
stand
the
girl
was
by
her
direction
called
sophia
so
that
we
had
two
romantic
names
in
the
family
but
i
solemnly
protest
i
had
no
hand
in
it
moses
was
our
next
and
after
an
interval
of
twelve
years
we
had
two
sons
more
these
two
youngest
boys
were
called
dick
and
bill
this
is
the
family
we
learn
to
know
in
the
vicar
when
the
story
opens
olivia
is
just
eighteen
sophia
seventeen
and
they
are
both
very
beautiful
girls
at
first
primrose
is
well
off
and
lives
comfortably
in
a
fine
house
but
before
the
story
goes
far
he
loses
all
his
money
and
is
obliged
to
go
with
his
family
to
a
poor
living
in
another
part
of
the
country
here
instead
of
their
handsome
house
they
have
a
tiny
cottage
with
whitewashed
walls
and
thatched
roof
for
a
home
it
is
a
very
quiet
country
life
which
they
have
now
to
live
and
yet
when
you
come
to
read
the
book
you
will
find
that
quite
a
number
of
exciting
things
happen
to
them
the
dear
doctor
soon
settles
down
to
his
changed
life
but
his
wife
and
her
beautiful
daughters
try
hard
to
be
as
fine
as
they
were
before
and
as
grand
if
not
grander
than
their
neighbors
this
desire
leads
to
not
a
few
of
their
adventures
among
other
things
they
decide
to
have
their
portraits
painted
this
is
how
primrose
tells
of
it
my
wife
and
daughters
happening
to
return
a
visit
to
neighbour
flamborough
found
that
family
had
lately
got
their
pictures
drawn
by
a
limner
who
travelled
the
country
and
took
likenesses
for
fifteen
shillings
as
this
family
and
ours
had
long
a
sort
of
rivalry
in
point
of
taste
our
spirit
took
the
alarm
at
this
stolen
march
upon
us
and
notwithstanding
all
i
could
say
and
i
said
much
it
was
resolved
that
we
should
have
our
pictures
done
too
having
therefore
engaged
the
limner
for
what
could
i
do
our
next
deliberation
was
to
show
the
superiority
of
our
taste
in
the
attitudes
as
for
our
neighbour
family
there
were
seven
of
them
and
they
were
drawn
with
seven
oranges
a
thing
quite
out
of
taste
no
variety
in
life
no
composition
in
the
world
we
desired
to
have
something
in
a
higher
style
and
after
many
debates
at
length
came
to
a
unanimous
resolution
of
being
drawn
together
in
one
large
historical
familypiece
this
would
be
cheaper
since
one
frame
would
serve
for
all
and
it
would
be
infinitely
more
genteel
for
all
families
of
any
taste
were
now
drawn
in
the
same
manner
as
we
did
not
immediately
recollect
an
historical
subject
to
hit
us
we
were
contented
each
with
being
drawn
as
independent
historical
figures
my
wife
desired
to
be
represented
as
venus
and
the
painter
was
instructed
not
to
be
too
frugal
of
his
diamonds
in
her
stomacher
and
hair
her
two
little
ones
were
to
be
as
cupids
by
her
side
while
i
in
my
gown
and
band
was
to
present
her
with
my
books
on
the
whistonian
controversy
olivia
would
be
drawn
as
an
amazon
sitting
upon
a
bank
of
flowers
dressed
in
a
green
joseph
richly
laced
with
gold
and
a
whip
in
her
hand
sophia
was
to
be
a
shepherdess
with
as
many
sheep
as
the
painter
could
put
in
for
nothing
and
moses
was
to
be
dressed
out
with
a
hat
and
white
feather
coat
with
capes
worn
by
ladies
in
the
eighteenth
century
for
riding
our
taste
so
much
pleased
the
squire
that
he
insisted
on
being
put
in
as
one
of
the
family
in
the
character
of
alexander
the
great
at
olivia
feet
this
was
considered
by
us
all
as
an
indication
of
his
desire
to
be
introduced
into
the
family
nor
could
we
refuse
his
request
the
painter
was
therefore
set
to
work
and
as
he
wrought
with
assiduity
and
expedition
in
less
than
four
days
the
whole
was
completed
the
piece
was
large
and
it
must
be
owned
he
did
not
spare
his
colours
for
which
my
wife
gave
him
great
encomiums
we
were
all
perfectly
satisfied
with
his
performance
but
an
unfortunate
circumstance
had
not
occurred
until
the
picture
was
finished
which
now
struck
us
with
dismay
it
was
so
very
large
that
we
had
no
place
in
the
house
to
fix
it
how
we
all
came
to
disregard
so
material
a
point
is
inconceivable
but
certain
it
is
we
had
been
all
greatly
remiss
the
picture
therefore
instead
of
gratifying
our
vanity
as
we
hoped
leaned
in
a
most
mortifying
manner
against
the
kitchen
wall
where
the
canvas
was
stretched
and
painted
much
too
large
to
be
got
through
any
of
the
doors
and
the
jest
of
all
our
neighbours
one
compared
it
to
robinson
crusoe
too
large
to
be
removed
another
thought
it
more
resembled
a
reel
in
a
bottle
some
wondered
how
it
could
be
got
out
but
still
more
were
amazed
how
it
ever
got
in
for
the
rest
of
the
troubles
and
adventures
of
the
good
vicar
and
his
family
you
must
go
to
the
book
itself
in
the
end
all
comes
right
and
we
leave
the
vicar
surrounded
by
his
family
with
dick
and
bill
sitting
on
his
knee
i
had
nothing
now
this
side
the
grave
to
wait
for
he
says
all
my
cares
were
over
my
pleasure
was
unspeakable
even
if
you
do
not
at
first
understand
all
of
this
book
i
think
it
will
repay
you
to
read
it
for
on
almost
every
page
you
will
find
touches
of
gentle
humor
we
feel
that
no
one
but
a
man
of
simple
childlike
heart
could
have
written
such
a
book
and
when
we
have
closed
it
we
feel
better
and
happier
for
having
read
it
but
delightful
though
we
find
the
vicar
of
wakefield
the
bookseller
who
bought
it
did
not
think
highly
enough
of
it
to
publish
it
at
once
meanwhile
goldsmith
published
a
poem
called
the
traveller
his
own
wanderings
on
the
continent
gave
him
the
subject
for
this
poem
for
goldsmith
like
milton
put
something
of
himself
into
all
his
best
works
the
traveller
was
such
a
success
that
the
bookseller
though
it
worth
while
to
publish
the
vicar
of
wakefield
goldsmith
was
now
famous
but
he
was
still
poor
he
lived
in
a
miserable
garret
doing
all
manner
of
literary
work
for
bread
among
the
things
he
wrote
was
a
play
called
the
good
natured
man
it
was
a
success
and
brought
him
in
pounds
goldsmith
now
left
his
garret
took
a
fine
set
of
rooms
furnished
them
grandly
and
gave
and
to
his
friends
these
were
the
days
of
goldy
splendor
he
no
longer
footed
it
in
the
great
world
in
rust
black
and
tarnished
gold
but
in
blue
silk
breeches
and
coat
with
silken
linings
and
golden
buttons
he
dined
with
great
people
he
strutted
in
innocent
vanity
delighted
to
shine
in
the
world
to
see
and
be
seen
although
in
johnson
company
he
could
never
really
shine
sam
was
a
great
talker
and
it
was
said
goldsmith
wrote
like
an
angel
and
spoke
like
poor
poll
his
friends
called
him
doctor
although
where
he
took
his
medical
degree
no
one
knows
and
he
certainly
had
no
other
degree
given
to
him
as
an
honor
as
johnson
had
so
johnson
was
major
goldsmith
only
minor
but
soon
these
days
of
wealth
were
over
soon
goldsmith
money
was
all
spent
and
once
again
he
had
to
sit
down
to
grinding
work
he
wrote
many
things
but
the
next
great
work
he
published
was
another
poem
the
deserted
village
the
deserted
village
like
the
traveller
is
written
in
the
heroic
couplet
which
since
the
days
of
dryden
had
held
its
ground
as
the
best
form
of
english
poetry
in
these
poems
the
couplet
has
reached
its
very
highest
level
for
although
his
rimes
are
smooth
and
polished
goldsmith
has
wrought
into
them
something
of
tender
grace
and
pathos
which
sets
them
above
the
glitter
of
pope
lines
his
couplets
are
transformed
by
the
celtic
touch
the
poem
tells
the
story
of
a
village
which
had
once
been
happy
and
flourishing
but
which
is
now
quite
deserted
and
fallen
to
ruins
the
village
is
thought
by
some
people
to
have
been
lissoy
where
oliver
had
lived
as
a
boy
but
others
think
this
can
not
be
for
they
say
no
irish
village
was
ever
so
peaceful
and
industrious
as
goldsmith
pictures
his
village
to
have
been
but
we
must
remember
that
the
poet
had
not
seen
his
home
since
childhood
and
that
he
looked
back
upon
it
through
the
golden
haze
of
memory
it
is
in
this
poem
that
we
have
the
picture
of
oliver
old
schoolmaster
which
i
have
already
given
you
here
too
we
have
a
picture
of
the
kindly
village
parson
who
may
be
taken
both
from
oliver
father
and
from
his
brother
henry
probably
he
had
his
brother
most
in
mind
for
henry
goldsmith
had
but
lately
died
and
i
loved
him
better
than
most
other
men
said
the
poet
sadly
in
the
dedication
of
this
poem
near
yonder
copse
where
once
the
garden
smiled
and
still
where
many
a
garden
flower
grows
wild
there
where
a
few
torn
shrubs
the
place
disclose
the
village
preacher
modest
mansion
rose
a
man
he
was
to
all
the
country
dear
and
passing
rich
with
forty
pounds
a
year
remote
from
towns
he
ran
his
godly
race
nor
had
changed
nor
wish
to
change
his
place
unpractis
he
to
fawn
or
seek
for
power
by
doctrines
fashion
to
the
varying
hour
far
other
aims
his
heart
had
learn
to
prize
more
skill
to
raise
the
wretched
than
to
rise
his
house
was
known
to
all
the
vagrant
train
he
chid
their
but
relieved
their
pain
the
beggar
was
his
guest
whose
beard
descending
swept
his
aged
breast
the
ruin
spendthrift
now
no
longer

and
had
his

the
broken
soldier
kindly
bade
to

by

night
away
wept
his

the
good

quite

their

their
woe
careless
their
merits
or
their
faults
to
scan
his
pity

ere
charity
began
thus
to
relieve
the
wretched

his
pride
and
his
failings

but
in
his

at
every
call

for
all
at

with
meek
and
unaffected

with
double
sway
and
fools
who

to

the

him
and
their

distrest
to
them
his
heart
his
love
his
griefs
were
given
but
all
his
serious
thoughts
had
rest
in
heaven
as
some
tall
cliff
that
lifts
its
awful
form

from
the
vale
and
midway

the
storm
though
round

eternal
sunshine
settles
on
its
head
goldsmith
last
great
work
was
a
comedy
named
she
stoops
to
conquer
it
is
said
that
the
idea
for
this
play
was
given
to
him
by
something
which
happened
to
himself
when
a
boy
the
last
time
that
goldsmith
returned
home
from
school
he
made
his
journey
on
horseback
the
horse
was
borrowed
or
hired
but
he
had
a
guinea
in
his
pocket
and
he
felt
very
grown
up
and
grand
he
had
to
spend
one
night
on
the
way
and
as
evening
came
on
he
asked
a
passing
stranger
to
direct
him
to
the
best
house
meaning
the
best
in
the
neighborhood
the
stranger
happened
to
be
the
village
wag
and
seeing
the
schoolboy
swagger
and
the
manly
airs
of
sixteen
he
in
fun
directed
him
to
the
house
there
the
boy
arrived
handed
over
his
horse
with
a
lordly
air
to
a
groom
marched
into
the
house
and
ordered
supper
and
a
bottle
of
wine
in
the
manner
of
the
times
in
drinking
his
wine
he
invited
his
landlord
to
join
him
as
a
real
man
might
have
done
the
squire
saw
the
joke
and
fell
in
with
it
and
not
until
next
morning
did
the
boy
discover
his
mistake
the
comedy
founded
on
this
adventure
was
a
great
success
and
no
wonder
for
it
bubbles
over
with
fun
and
laughter
some
day
you
will
read
the
play
perhaps
too
you
may
see
it
acted
for
it
is
still
sometimes
acted
in
any
case
it
makes
very
good
reading
but
goldsmith
did
not
long
enjoy
the
new
fame
this
comedy
brought
him
in
the
spring
of
less
than
a
year
after
it
appeared
the
kindly
spendthrift
author
lay
dead
he
was
only
the
beginning
of
goldsmith
life
had
been
a
struggle
with
poverty
the
end
was
a
struggle
with
debt
by
his
writing
he
made
what
was
in
those
days
a
good
deal
of
money
but
he
could
not
keep
it
to
give
him
money
was
like
pouring
water
into
a
sieve
is
your
mind
at
ease
asked
his
doctor
as
he
lay
dying
no
it
is
not
answered
goldsmith
those
were
his
last
words
of
poor
dear
goldsmith
wrote
johnson
there
is
little
to
be
told
more
than
the
papers
have
made
public
he
died
of
a
fever
made
i
am
afraid
more
violent
by
uneasiness
of
mind
his
debts
began
to
be
heavy
and
all
his
resources
were
exhausted
sir
is
of
opinion
that
he
owed
not
less
than
two
thousand
pounds
was
ever
poet
so
trusted
before
joshua
reynolds
the
famous
painter
goldsmith
was
buried
in
the
graveyard
of
the
temple
church
but
his
tomb
is
unmarked
and
where
he
lies
no
one
knows
his
sorrowing
friends
however
placed
a
tablet
to
his
memory
in
westminster
so
that
his
name
at
least
is
recorded
upon
the
roll
of
the
great
dead

no
song
perhaps
is
so
familiar
to
people
as
that
with
which
this
chapter
begins
in
the
back
woods
of
canada
in
far
australia
on
the
wide
south
african
veldt
wherever
people
meet
and
gather
they
join
hands
to
sing
that
song
to
the
merriest
gathering
it
comes
as
a
fitting
close
it
is
the
hymn
of
home
of
treasured
friendships
and
of
old
memories
just
as
god
save
the
king
is
the
hymn
of
loyalty
and
yet
it
is
written
in
scots
which
english
tongues
can
hardly
pronounce
and
many
words
of
which
to
english
ears
hardly
carry
a
meaning
but
the
plaintive
melody
and
the
pathetic
force
of
the
rhythm
grip
the
heart
there
is
no
need
to
understand
every
word
of
this
glad
kind
greeting
any
more
than
there
is
need
to
understand
what
some
great
musician
means
by
every
note
which
his
violin
sings
forth
the
writer
of
that
song
was
like
caedmon
long
ago
a
son
of
the
soil
he
too
was
a
ploughman
mackenzie
while
goldsmith
lay
in
london
in
the
breezy
scottish
lowlands
a
big
rough
lad
of
fifteen
called
robert
burns
was
following
his
father
plow
by
day
poring
over
shakespeare
the
spectator
and
pope
homer
of
nights
not
knowing
that
in
years
to
come
he
was
to
be
remembered
as
our
greatest
song
writer
robert
was
the
son
of
a
small
farmer
the
burns
had
been
farmer
folk
for
generations
but
william
burns
had
fallen
on
evil
days
from
his
northern
home
he
drifted
to
ayrshire
and
settled
down
in
the
village
of
alloway
as
a
gardener
here
with
his
own
hands
he
built
himself
a
mud
cottage
it
consisted
only
of
a
room
and
a
kitchen
whitewashed
within
and
without
in
the
kitchen
there
was
a
fireplace
a
bed
and
a
small
cupboard
and
little
else
beyond
the
table
and
chairs
and
in
this
poor
cottage
in
the
wild
january
weather
of
wee
robert
was
born
scarcely
a
week
later
one
windy
night
a
gable
of
his
frail
home
was
blown
in
so
fierce
was
the
gale
that
it
seemed
as
if
the
whole
wall
might
fall
so
through
the
darkness
and
the
storm
the
baby
and
his
mother
were
carried
to
a
neighbor
house
there
they
remained
for
a
week
until
their
own
cottage
was
again
made
fit
to
live
in
it
was
a
rough
entry
into
the
world
for
the
wee
lad
for
some
time
william
burns
went
on
working
as
a
gardener
then
when
robert
was
about
seven
he
took
a
small
farm
called
mount
oliphant
and
removed
there
with
his
wife
and
family
he
had
a
hard
struggle
to
make
his
farm
pay
to
feed
and
clothe
little
robert
and
his
brothers
and
sisters
who
were
growing
up
fast
about
him
but
poor
though
he
was
william
burns
made
up
his
mind
that
his
children
should
be
well
taught
at
six
robert
went
daily
to
school
and
when
the
master
was
sent
away
somewhere
else
and
the
village
of
alloway
was
left
without
any
teacher
william
burns
and
four
neighbors
joined
together
to
pay
for
one
but
as
they
could
not
pay
enough
to
give
him
a
house
in
which
to
live
he
used
to
stay
with
each
family
in
turn
for
a
few
weeks
at
a
time
robert
in
those
days
was
a
serious
small
boy
and
he
and
his
brother
gilbert
were
the
cleverest
scholars
in
the
little
school
chief
among
their
school
books
was
the
bible
and
a
collection
of
english
prose
and
verse
it
was
from
the
last
that
burns
first
came
to
know
addison
works
for
in
this
book
he
found
the
vision
of
mirza
and
other
spectator
tales
and
loved
them
robert
had
a
splendid
memory
in
school
hours
he
stored
his
mind
with
the
grand
grave
tales
of
the
bible
and
with
the
stately
english
of
addison
out
of
school
hours
he
listened
to
the
tales
and
songs
of
an
old
woman
who
sang
to
him
or
told
him
stories
of
fairies
and
brownies
of
witches
and
warlocks
of
giants
enchanted
towns
dragons
and
what
not
the
first
books
he
read
out
of
school
were
a
life
of
hannibal
the
great
carthagenian
general
and
a
life
of
wallace
the
great
scottish
hero
this
last
being
lent
him
by
the
blacksmith
these
books
excited
little
robert
so
much
that
if
ever
a
recruiting
sergeant
came
to
his
village
he
would
strut
up
and
down
in
raptures
after
the
drum
and
bagpipe
and
long
to
be
tall
enough
to
be
a
soldier
the
story
of
wallace
too
awoke
in
his
heart
a
love
of
scotland
and
all
things
scottish
which
remained
with
him
his
whole
life
through
at
times
he
would
steal
away
by
himself
to
read
the
brave
sad
story
and
weep
over
the
hard
fate
of
his
hero
and
as
he
was
in
the
wallace
country
he
wandered
near
and
far
exploring
every
spot
where
his
hero
might
have
been
after
a
year
of
two
the
second
schoolmaster
went
away
as
the
other
had
done
then
all
the
schooling
the
burns
children
had
was
from
their
father
in
the
long
winter
evenings
after
the
farm
work
for
the
day
was
over
and
so
the
years
went
on
the
family
at
mount
oliphant
living
a
hard
and
sparing
life
for
years
they
never
knew
what
it
was
to
have
meat
for
dinner
yet
when
robert
was
thirteen
his
father
managed
to
send
him
and
gilbert
week
about
to
a
school
two
or
three
miles
away
he
could
not
send
them
both
together
for
he
could
neither
afford
to
pay
two
fees
nor
could
he
spare
both
boys
at
once
as
already
the
children
helped
with
the
farm
work
at
fifteen
robert
was
his
father
chief
laborer
he
was
a
very
good
plowman
and
no
one
in
all
the
countryside
could
wield
the
scythe
or
the
with
so
much
skill
and
vigor
he
worked
hard
yet
he
found
time
to
read
borrowing
books
from
whoever
would
lend
them
thus
before
he
was
fifteen
he
had
read
shakespeare
and
pope
and
the
spectator
besides
a
good
many
other
books
which
would
seem
to
most
boys
of
very
dull
indeed
but
the
book
he
liked
best
was
a
collection
of
songs
he
carried
it
about
with
him
i
pored
over
them
he
says
driving
in
my
cart
or
walking
to
labour
song
by
song
verse
by
verse
thus
the
years
passed
as
burns
himself
says
in
the
cheerless
gloom
of
a
hermit
with
the
unceasing
toil
of
a
then
when
robert
was
about
nineteen
his
father
made
another
move
to
the
farm
of
lochlea
about
ten
miles
off
it
was
a
larger
and
better
farm
and
for
three
or
four
years
the
family
lived
in
comfort
in
one
of
burns

but
chiefly
in

hearts
with
grace
divine
preside
as
robert
grew
to
be
a
man
the
changes
in
his
somber
life
were
few
but
once
he
spent
a
summer
on
the
coast
learning
how
to
measure
and
survey
land
in
this
he
made
good
progress
but
he
says
i
made
a
greater
progress
in
the
knowledge
of
mankind
for
it
was
a
smuggling
district
robert
came
to
know
the
men
who
carried
on
the
unlawful
trade
and
so
was
present
at
many
a
wild
and
riotous
scene
and
saw
men
in
new
lights
he
had
already
begun
to
write
poetry
now
he
began
to
write
letters
too
he
did
not
write
with
the
idea
alone
of
giving
his
friends
news
of
him
he
wrote
to
improve
his
power
of
language
he
came
across
a
book
of
letters
of
the
wits
of
queen
anne
reign
and
these
he
pored
over
eager
to
make
his
own
style
good
when
robert
was
he
again
left
home
this
time
he
went
to
the
little
seaport
town
of
irvine
to
learn
flax
dressing
for
on
the
farm
the
father
and
brothers
had
begun
to
grow
flax
and
it
was
thought
well
that
one
of
them
should
know
how
to
prepare
it
for
spinning
here
robert
got
into
evil
company
and
trouble
he
sinned
and
repented
and
sinned
again
we
find
him
writing
to
his
father
as
for
this
world
i
despair
of
ever
making
a
figure
in
it
i
am
not
formed
for
the
bustle
of
the
busy
nor
the
flutter
of
the
gay
i
shall
never
again
be
capable
of
entering
into
such
scenes
burns
knew
himself
to
be
a
man
of
faults
the
knowledge
of
his
own
weakness
perhaps
made
him
kindly
to
other
in
one
of
his
poems
he
wrote
then
gently
scan
your
brother
man
still
gentler
sister
woman
tho
they
may
gang
a
kennin
wrang
to
step
aside
is
human
one
point
must
still
be
greatly
dark
the
moving
why
they
do
it
and
just
as
lamely
can
ye
mark
how
far
perhaps
they
rue
it
very
little
wrong
who
made
the
heart
is
he
alone
decidedly
can
try
us
he
knows
each
chord
its
various
tone
each
spring
its
various
bias
then
at
the
balance
let
be
mute
we
never
can
adjust
it
what
done
we
partly
may
compute
but
know
not
what
resisted
bad
fortune
too
followed
burns
the
shop
in
which
he
was
engaged
was
set
on
fire
and
he
was
left
like
a
true
poet
not
worth
a
sixpence
so
leaving
the
troubles
and
temptations
of
irvine
behind
he
carried
home
a
smirched
name
to
his
father
house
here
too
troubles
were
gathering
bad
harvests
were
followed
by
money
difficulties
and
weighed
down
with
all
his
cares
william
burns
died
the
brothers
had
already
taken
another
farm
named
mossgiel
soon
after
the
father
death
the
whole
family
went
to
live
there
robert
meant
to
settle
down
and
be
a
regular
farmer
come
go
to
i
will
be
wise
he
said
he
read
farming
books
and
bought
a
little
diary
in
which
he
meant
to
write
down
farming
notes
but
the
farming
notes
often
turned
out
to
be
scraps
of
poetry
the
next
four
years
of
burns
life
were
eventful
years
for
though
he
worked
hard
as
he
guided
the
plow
or
swung
the
scythe
he
wove
songs
in
his
head
and
as
he
followed
his
trade
year
in
year
out
from
summer
to
winter
from
winter
to
summer
he
learned
all
the
secrets
of
the
earth
and
sky
of
the
hedgerow
and
the
field
how
everything
that
was
beautiful
and
tender
and
helpless
in
nature
appealed
to
him
we
know
from
his
poems
there
is
the
field
mouse
the
wee
sleekit
beastie
whose
nest
he
turned
up
and
destroyed
in
his
november
plowing
poor

gang
aft

an

nought
but
grief
and

for

it
goes
to
his

burns
wrote
love
songs
too
for
he
was
constantly
in
love
often
to
his
discredit
and
at
length
he
married
jean
armour
scots
fashion
by
writing
a
paper
saying
that
they
were
man
and
wife
and
giving
it
to
her
this
was
enough
in
those
days
to
make
a
marriage
but
burns
had
no
money
the
brothers
farm
had
not
prospered
and
jean
father
a
stern
old
scotsman
would
have
nothing
to
say
to
robert
who
was
in
his
opinion
a
bad
man
and
a
wild
unstable
penniless
rimester
he
made
his
daughter
burn
her
lines
thus
in
his
idea
putting
an
end
to
the
marriage
robert
at
this
was
both
hurt
and
angry
and
made
up
his
mind
to
leave
scotland
for
ever
and
never
see
his
wife
and
children
more
he
got
a
post
as
overseer
on
an
estate
in
jamaica
but
money
to
pay
for
his
passage
he
had
none
in
order
to
get
money
some
friends
proposed
that
he
should
publish
his
poems
this
he
did
and
the
book
was
such
a
success
that
instead
of
going
to
jamaica
as
an
unknown
exile
burns
went
to
edinburgh
to
be
entertained
fêted
and
flattered
by
the
greatest
men
of
the
day
all
the
fine
ladies
and
gentlemen
were
eager
to
see
the
plowman
poet
the
fuss
they
made
over
him
was
enough
to
turn
the
head
of
a
lesser
man
but
in
spite
of
all
the
flattery
burns
though
pleased
and
glad
remained
as
simple
as
before
he
moved
among
the
grand
people
in
their
silks
and
velvets
clad
in
homespun
clothes
like
a
farmer
dressed
in
his
best
to
dine
with
the
laird
as
easily
as
he
had
moved
among
his
humble
friends
he
held
himself
with
that
proud
independence
which
later
made
him
write
is
there
for
honest
poverty
that
hangs
his
head
and
a
that
the
coward
slave
we
pass
him
by
we
dare
to
be
poor
for
a
that
for
a
that
and
a
that
our
toils
obscure
and
a
that
the
rank
is
but
the
guinea
stamp
the
man
the
gowd
for
a
that
what
though
on
hamely
fare
we
dine
wear
hodden
grey
and
a
that
gie
fools
their
silks
and
knaves
their
wine
a
man
a
man
for
a

for
a
that
and
a
that
their
tinsel
show
and
a
that
the
honest
man
though
sae
poor
is
king
o
men
for
a
that
after
spending
a
brilliant
winter
in
edinburgh
burns
set
off
on
several
tours
through
his
native
land
visiting
many
of
the
places
famous
in
scottish
history
but
as
the
months
went
on
he
began
to
be
restless
in
his
seeming
idleness
the
smiles
of
the
great
world
would
not
keep
hunger
from
the
door
he
feared
that
his
fame
might
be
only
a
nine
days
wonder
so
he
decided
to
return
to
his
farming
he
took
a
farm
a
few
miles
from
dumfries
and
although
since
he
had
been
parted
from
his
jean
he
had
forgotten
her
time
and
again
and
made
love
to
many
another
he
and
she
were
now
married
this
time
in
good
truth
from
now
onward
it
was
that
burns
wrote
some
of
his
most
beautiful
songs
and
it
is
for
his
songs
that
we
remember
him
some
of
them
are
his
own
entirely
and
some
are
founded
upon
old
songs
that
had
been
handed
on
for
generations
by
the
people
from
father
to
son
but
had
never
been
written
down
until
burns
heard
them
and
saved
them
from
being
forgotten
but
in
every
case
he
left
the
song
a
far
more
beautiful
thing
than
he
found
it
none
of
them
perhaps
is
more
beautiful
than
that
he
now
wrote
to
his
jean
of
a
the
the
wind
can
blaw
i
dearly
like
the
wet
for
there
the
bonnie
lassie
lives
the
lassie
i
best
the
grow
and
rivers
row
and
mony
a
hill
between
but
day
and
night
my
fancy
flight
is
ever
wi
my
jean
i
see
her
in
the
dewy
flowers
i
see
her
sweet
and
fair
i
hear
her
in
the
tunefu
birds
i
hear
her
charm
the
air
there
not
a
bonnie
flower
that
springs
by
fountain
shaw
or
green
there
not
a
bonnie
bird
that
sings
but
minds
me
o
my
jean
but
farming
and
did
not
seem
to
go
together
and
on
his
new
farm
burns
succeeded
little
better
than
on
any
that
he
had
tried
before
he
thought
to
add
to
his
livelihood
by
turning
an
excise
man
that
is
an
officer
whose
work
is
to
put
down
smuggling
to
collect
the
duty
on
whisky
and
to
see
that
none
upon
which
duty
has
not
been
paid
is
sold
one
of
his
fine
edinburgh
friends
got
an
appointment
for
him
and
he
began
his
duties
and
it
would
seem
fulfilled
them
well
but
this
mode
of
life
was
for
burns
a
failure
in
discharge
of
his
duties
he
had
to
ride
hundreds
of
miles
in
all
kinds
of
weathers
he
became
worn
out
by
the
fatigue
of
it
and
it
brought
him
into
the
temptation
of
drinking
too
much
things
went
with
him
from
bad
to
worse
and
at
length
he
died
at
the
age
of
worn
out
by
toil
and
sin
and
suffering
in
many
ways
his
was
a
misspent
life
at
once
unfinished
and
a
ruin
his
was
the
poet
soul
bound
in
the
body
of
clay
he
was
an
unhappy
man
and
we
can
not
but
pity
him
and
yet
remember
him
with
gratitude
for
the
beautiful
songs
he
gave
us
in
his
own
words
we
may
say
is
there
a
man
whose
judgment
clear
can
others
teach
the
course
to
steer
yet
runs
himself
life
mad
career
wild
as
the
wave
here
pause
and
through
the
starting
tear
survey
this
grave
burns
was
a
true
son
of
the
soil
there
is
no
art
in
his
songs
but
only
nature
apart
form
his
melody
what
strikes
us
most
is
his
truth
he
sang
of
what
he
saw
of
what
he
felt
and
knew
he
knew
the
scottish
peasant
through
and
through
grave
and
humorous
simple
and
cunning
honest
and
hypocritical
proud
and
independent
every
phase
of
him
is
to
be
found
in
burns
poems
he
knew
love
too
and
in
every
phase
happy
and
unhappy
worthy
and
unworthy
he
sings
of
it
but
it
is
of
love
in
truth
that
he
sings
here
we
have
no
more
the
of
the
elizabethan
age
no
longer
the
stilted
measure
of
the
georgian
the
day
of
the

we
come

cowper
the
task
while
burns
was
weaving
his
wonderful
songs
among
the
lowland
hills
of
scotland
another
lover
of
nature
was
telling
of
placid
english
life
of
simple
everyday
doings
in
a
quiet
little
country
town
in
england
this
man
was
william
cowper
cowper
was
the
son
of
a
clergyman
he
was
born
in
and
became
a
barrister
but
it
seemed
a
profession
for
which
he
was
little
fitted
he
was
shy
and
morbidly
religious
and
he
also
liked
literature
much
better
than
law
still
he
continued
his
way
of
life
until
when
he
was
he
was
offered
a
post
as
clerk
of
the
journals
of
the
house
of
lords
he
wished
to
accept
the
post
but
was
told
he
must
stand
an
examination
at
the
bar
of
the
house
of
lords
this
was
more
than
his
nervous
sensitive
nature
could
bear
rather
than
face
the
trial
he
decided
to
die
three
times
he
tried
to
kill
himself
three
times
he
failed
then
the
darkness
of
madness
closed
in
upon
him
religious
terrors
seized
him
and
for
many
months
he
suffered
agonies
of
mind
but
at
length
his
tortured
brain
found
rest
and
he
became
once
more
a
sane
man
then
he
made
up
his
mind
to
leave
london
and
all
the
excitements
of
a
life
for
which
he
was
not
fit
and
after
a
few
changes
here
and
there
he
settled
down
to
a
peaceful
life
with
a
clergyman
and
his
wife
named
unwin
and
when
after
two
years
unwin
died
cowper
still
lived
with
his
widow
with
her
he
moved
to
olney
in
buckinghamshire
it
was
here
that
together
with
the
curate
john
newton
cowper
wrote
the
olney
hymns
many
of
which
are
still
well
loved
perhaps
one
of
the
best
is
that
beginning
god
moves
in
a
mysterious
way
his
wonders
to
perform
he
plants
his
footsteps
in
the
sea
and
rides
upon
the
storm
it
was
written
when
cowper
felt
again
the
darkness
of
insanity
closing
in
upon
him
once
again
he
tried
to
end
his
life
but
again
the
storm
passed
cowper
was
already
a
man
of
nearly
fifty
when
these
hymns
first
appeared
shortly
afterwards
he
published
another
volume
of
poems
in
the
style
of
pope
it
was
after
this
that
cowper
found
another
friend
who
brought
some
brightness
into
his
life
lady
austen
a
widow
took
a
house
near
cowper
and
unwin
and
became
a
third
in
their
friendship
it
was
she
who
told
cowper
the
story
of
john
gilpin
the
story
tickled
his
fancy
so
that
he
woke
in
the
night
with
laughter
over
it
he
decided
to
make
a
ballad
of
the
story
and
the
next
day
the
ballad
was
finished
i
think
i
need
hardly
give
you
any
quotation
here
you
all
know
that
john
gilpin
was
a
citizen
of
credit
and
reknown
a
captain
eke
was
he
of
famous
london
town
and
you
have
heard
his
adventures
on
the
anniversary
of
his
wedding
day
john
gilpin
was
first
published
in
a
magazine
and
there
it
was
seen
by
an
actor
famous
in
his
day
who
took
it
for
a
recitation
it
at
once
became
a
success
and
thousands
of
copies
were
sold
it
was
lady
austen
too
who
urged
cowper
to
his
greatest
work
the
task
she
wanted
him
to
try
blank
verse
but
he
objected
that
he
had
nothing
to
write
about
you
can
write
upon
any
subject
replied
lady
austen
write
upon
the
sofa
so
cowper
accepted
the
task
thus
set
for
him
and
began
to
write
the
first
book
of
the
task
is
called
the
sofa
and
through
all
the
six
books
we
follow
the
course
of
his
simple
country
life
it
is
the
epic
of
simplicity
at
once
pathetic
and
playful
its
tuneful
easy
blank
verse
never
rises
to
the
grandeur
of
milton
yet
there
are
fine
passages
in
it
though
cowper
lived
a
retired
and
uneventful
life
the
great
questions
of
his
day
found
an
echo
in
his
heart
canada
had
been
won
and
the
american
states
lost
when
he
wrote
england
with
all
thy
faults
i
love
thee
still
my
country
and
while
yet
a
nook
is
left
where
english
minds
and
manners
may
be
found
shall
be
constrained
to
love
thee
time
was
when
it
was
praise
and
boast
enough
in
every
clime
and
travel
where
we
might
that
we
were
born
her
children
praise
enough
to
fill
the
ambition
of
a
private
man
that
chatham
language
was
his
mother
tongue
and
wolfe
great
name
compatriot
with
his
own
farewell
those
honours
and
farewell
with
them
the
hope
of
such
hereafter
they
have
fallen
each
in
his
field
of
glory
one
in
arms
and
one
in
council
wolfe
upon
the
lap
of
smiling
victory
that
moment
won
and
chatham
of
his
country
shame
they
made
us
many
soldiers
chatham
still
consulting
england
happiness
at
home
secured
it
by
an
unforgiving
frown
if
any
wronged
her
wolfe
he
fought
put
so
much
of
his
heart
into
his
act
that
his
example
had
a
magnet
force
and
all
were
swift
to
follow
where
all
loved
these
lines
are
from
the
second
book
of
the
task
called
the
timepiece
the
third
is
called
the
garden
the
fourth
the
winter
evening
there
we
have
the
picture
of
a
quiet
evening
by
the
cozy
fireside
the
post
boy
has
come
with
spattered
boots
strapped
waist
and
frozen
locks
he
has
brought
letters
and
the
newspaper
now
stir
the
fire
and
close
the
shutters
fast
let
fall
the
curtains
wheel
the
sofa
round
and
while
the
bubbling
and
urn
throws
up
a
steamy
column
and
the
cups
that
cheer
but
not
inebriate
wait
on
each
so
let
us
welcome
peaceful
evening
in
the
poem
ends
with
two
books
called
the
winter
morning
walk
and
the
winter
walk
at
noon
though
not
grand
the
task
is
worth
reading
it
is
too
an
easily
read
and
easily
understood
poem
and
through
it
all
we
feel
the
love
of
nature
the
return
to
romance
and
simplicity
in
the
last
book
we
see
cowper
love
of
animals
there
he
sings
if
not
the
virtues
yet
the
worth
of
brutes
cowper
loved
animals
tenderly
and
understood
them
in
a
wonderful
manner
he
tamed
some
hares
and
made
them
famous
in
his
verse
and
when
he
felt
madness
coming
upon
him
he
often
found
relief
in
his
interest
in
these
pets
one
of
his
poems
tells
how
cowper
scolded
his
spaniel
beau
for
killing
a
little
baby
bird
not
because
you
were
hungry
says
the
poet
but
out
of
naughtiness
here
is
beau
reply
sir
when
i
flew
to
seize
the
bird
in
spite
of
your
command
a
louder
voice
than
yours
i
heard
and
harder
to
withstand
you
cried
but
in
my
breast
a
mightier
cried
was
nature
sir
whose
strong
behest
impelled
me
to
the
deed
yet
much
as
nature
i
respect
i
ventured
once
to
break
as
you
perhaps
may
recollect
her
precept
for
your
sake
and
when
your
linnet
on
a
day
passing
his
prison
door
had
fluttered
all
his
strength
away
and
panting
pressed
the
floor
well
knowing
him
a
sacred
thing
not
destined
to
my
tooth
i
only
kissed
his
ruffled
wing
and
licked
the
feathers
smooth
let
my
obedience
then
excuse
my
disobedience
now
nor
some
reproof
yourself
refuse
from
your
aggrieved
if
killing
birds
be
such
a
crime
which
i
can
hardly
see
what
think
you
sir
of
killing
time
with
verse
addressed
to
me
as
cowper
life
went
on
the
terrible
lapses
into
insanity
became
more
frequent
but
his
sweet
and
kindly
temper
won
him
many
friends
and
he
still
wrote
a
great
deal
and
among
the
many
things
he
wrote
his
letters
to
his
friends
were
not
the
least
interesting
they
are
among
the
best
letters
in
our
language
perhaps
cowper
greatest
accomplishment
though
not
his
greatest
work
was
a
translation
of
homer
he
had
never
considered
homer
good
and
he
wished
to
leave
to
the
world
a
better
cowper
version
was
published
in
and
he
fondly
believed
that
it
would
take
the
place
of
pope
but
although
may
be
more
correct
it
is
plain
and
dry
and
while
pope
is
still
read
and
remembered
cowper
is
forgotten
indeed
that
cowper
is
remembered
at
all
is
due
more
to
his
shorter
poems
such
as
boadicea
and
the
wreck
of
the
royal
george
and
chiefly
perhaps
to
john
gilpin
which
in
its
own
way
is
a
treasure
that
we
would
not
be
without
other
of
his
shorter
poems
are
full
of
a
simple
pathos
and
gentle
humor
the
last
he
wrote
was
called
the
castaway
and
the
verse
with
which
it
ends
describes
not
unfittingly
the
close
of
his
own
life
for
his
mind
sank
ever
deeper
into
the
shadow
of
madness
until
he
died
in
april
no
voice
divine
the
storm
allayed
no
light
propitious
shone
when
snatched
from
all
effectual
aid
we
perished
each
alone
but
i
beneath
a
rougher
sea
and
whelmed
in
deeper
gulfs
than
he
cowper
was
never
a
power
in
our
literature
but
he
was
a
forerunner
the
forerunner
of
the
great
restoration
of
our
literature
and
unlike
most
forerunners
he
was
popular
in
his
own
day
and
although
it
is
faint
like
the
scent
of
forgotten
rose
leaves
his
poetry
still
keeps
a
charm
and
sweetness
for
those
who
will
look
for
it
chapter
lxxiv
wordsworth
the
poet
of
nature
cowper
was
as
a
straw
blown
along
the
path
he
had
no
force
in
himself
he
showed
the
direction
of
the
wind
now
we
come
to
one
who
was
not
only
a
far
greater
poet
but
who
was
a
force
in
our
literature
this
man
was
william
wordsworth
he
was
the
apostle
of
simplicity
the
prophet
of
nature
he
sang
of
the
simplest
things
of
the
common
happenings
of
everyday
life
and
that
too
a
simple
life
his
desire
was
to
choose
words
only
which
were
really
used
by
men
in
everyday
talk
and
at
the
same
time
to
throw
over
them
a
certain
colouring
of
the
imagination
he
chose
to
sing
of
humble
life
because
there
men
thoughts
and
feelings
were
more
free
from
art
and
restraint
there
they
spoke
a
plainer
more
forceful
language
there
they
were
in
touch
with
all
that
was
lasting
and
true
in
nature
here
then
you
will
say
is
the
poet
for
us
the
poet
who
tells
of
simple
things
in
simple
words
such
as
we
can
understand
and
yet
perhaps
strange
as
it
may
seem
there
is
no
poet
who
makes
less
appeal
to
young
minds
than
does
wordsworth
in
reading
poetry
though
we
may
not
always
understand
every
word
of
it
we
want
to
feel
the
thrill
and
glamour
of
it
and
when
wordsworth
remembers
his
own
rules
and
keeps
to
them
there
is
no
glamour
and
his
simplicity
is
apt
to
seem
to
us
mere
silliness
when
we
are
very
young
we
can
not
walk
alone
and
are
glad
of
a
kindly
helping
hand
to
guide
our
footsteps
in
learning
to
read
as
in
learning
to
walk
it
is
at
first
well
to
trust
to
a
guiding
hand
and
in
learning
to
read
poetry
it
is
at
first
well
to
use
selections
chosen
for
us
by
those
wiser
than
ourselves
later
when
we
can
go
alone
we
take
a
man
whole
work
and
choose
for
ourselves
what
we
will
most
love
in
it
and
it
is
only
by
making
use
of
this
power
of
choice
that
we
can
really
enjoy
what
is
best
but
of
all
our
great
writers
wordsworth
is
perhaps
the
last
in
the
reading
of
whose
works
we
willingly
go
alone
he
is
perhaps
the
writer
who
gains
most
by
being
read
in
selections
indeed
for
some
of
us
there
never
comes
a
time
when
we
care
to
read
his
whole
works
for
if
we
take
his
whole
works
at
times
we
plow
through
pages
of
argument
where
there
is
never
a
glimmer
of
that
beauty
which
makes
poetry
a
joy
till
we
grow
weary
of
it
then
suddenly
there
springs
to
our
eye
a
line
of
truest
beauty
which
sets
our
senses
atingle
with
delight
and
all
our
labor
is
more
than
paid
and
if
our
great
poets
were
to
be
judged
by
single
lines
or
single
stanzas
we
may
safely
say
that
wordsworth
would
be
placed
high
among
them
he
is
so
placed
but
it
is
rather
by
the
love
of
the
few
than
by
the
voice
of
the
many
i
am
not
trying
to
make
you
afraid
of
reading
wordsworth
i
am
only
warning
you
that
you
must
not
go
to
him
expecting
to
gather
flowers
you
must
go
expecting
to
and
willing
to
dig
for
gold
yet
although
wordsworth
gives
us
broad
deserts
of
prose
in
his
poetry
he
himself
knew
the
joy
of
words
in
lovely
sequence
he
tells
us
that
when
he
was
ten
years
old
or
less
already
his
mind
with
conscious
pleasure
opened
to
the
charm
of
words
in
tuneful
order
found
them
sweet
for
their
own
sakes
a
passion
and
a
power
and
phrases
pleased
me
chosen
for
delight
for
pomp
or
love
book
when
wordsworth
first
published
his
poems
they
were
received
with
scorn
and
he
was
treated
with
neglect
greater
even
than
most
great
poets
have
had
to
endure
but
in
time
the
tide
turned
and
people
came
at
last
to
acknowledge
that
wordsworth
was
not
only
a
poet
but
a
great
one
he
showed
men
a
new
way
of
poetry
he
proved
to
them
that
nightingale
was
as
poetical
a
word
as
philomel
that
it
was
possible
to
speak
of
the
sun
and
the
moon
as
the
sun
and
the
moon
and
not
as
phoebus
and
diana
phoebus
diana
and
philomel
are
with
the
thoughts
they
convey
beautiful
in
their
right
places
but
so
are
the
sun
moon
and
nightingale
wordsworth
tried
to
make
men
see
with
new
eyes
the
little
everyday
things
that
they
had
looked
upon
week
by
week
and
year
by
year
until
they
had
grown
common
he
tried
to
make
them
see
these
things
again
with
the
glory
and
the
freshness
of
a
dream
intimations
of
immortality
wordsworth
fought
the
battle
of
the
simple
word
and
phrase
and
thought
and
won
it
and
the
poets
who
came
after
him
and
not
the
poets
only
but
the
prose
writer
too
whether
they
acknowledged
it
or
not
whether
they
knew
it
or
now
entered
as
by
right
into
the
possession
of
the
kingdom
which
he
had
won
for
them
and
now
let
me
tell
you
a
little
of
the
life
of
this
nature
poet
william
wordsworth
was
born
at
cockermouth
in
cumberland
in
he
was
the
second
son
of
john
wordsworth
a
lawyer
and
law
agent
for
the
earl
of
lonsdale
william
mother
died
when
he
was
still
a
very
small
boy
and
he
remembered
little
about
her
he
remembered
dimly
that
one
day
as
he
was
going
to
church
she
pinned
some
flowers
into
his
coat
he
remembered
seeing
her
once
lying
in
an
easy
chair
when
she
was
ill
and
that
was
nearly
all
before
wordsworth
lost
his
mother
he
had
a
happy
childhood
he
spent
long
days
playing
about
in
garden
and
orchard
or
on
the
banks
of
the
derwent
with
his
friends
and
brothers
and
his
sister
dorothy
in
one
of
his
long
poems
called
the
prelude
which
is
a
history
of
his
own
young
life
he
tells
of
these
happy
childish
hours
in
other
of
his
poems
he
tells
of
the
love
and
comradeship
that
there
was
between
himself
and
his
sister
though
she
was
two
years
younger
oh
pleasant
pleasant
were
the
days
the
time
when
in
our
childish
plays
my
sister
emmeline
and
i
together
chased
the
butterfly
a
very
hunter
did
i
rush
upon
the
prey
with
leaps
and
springs
i
followed
on
from
brake
to
bush
but
she
god
love
her
feared
to
brush
the
dust
from
off
its
wings
a
butterfly
together
they
spied
out
the
sparrows
nests

they
grew

rough
boy
learning
much
from
his
gentle
sister

after
years
he
said
she
gave
me
eyes
she
gave

and
humble
cares
and
delicate

days

went
to
school
at
hawkshead
with
his
brothers
and
dorothy
was
sent
to
live
with
her
grandfather
at
penrith
but
wordsworth
was
happy
too
hawkshead
was
among
the
beautiful
lake
and
mountain
scenery
that
he
loved
he
had
a
great
deal
of
freedom
and
out
of
school
hours
could
take
long
rambles
day
and
night
too
when
moon
and
stars
were
shining
he
would
wander
among
the
hills
until
the
spirit
of
the
place
laid
hold
of
him
and
he
says
i
heard
among
the
solitary
hills
low
breathings
coming
after
me
and
sounds
of
undistinguishable
motion
steps
almost
as
silent
as
the
turf
they
trod
book
wordsworth
fished
and
climbing
perilous
crags
and
slippery
rocks
to
find
rare
eggs
in
summer
he
and
his
companions
rowed
upon
the
lake
in
winter
they
skated
and
in
the
frosty
season
when
the
sun
was
set
and
visible
for
many
a
mile
the
cottage
windows
blazed
through
twilight
gloom
i
heeded
not
their
summons
happy
time
it
was
indeed
for
all
of
us
for
me
a
time
of
rapture
clear
and
loud
the
village
clock
tolled
six
i
wheeled
about
proud
and
exulting
like
an
untired
horse
that
cares
not
for
his
home
all
shod
with
steel
we
hissed
along
the
polished
ice
in
games
we
were
a
noisy
crew
the
sun
in
heaven
beheld
not
vales
more
beautiful
than
ours
nor
saw
a
band
in
happiness
and
joy
richer
or
worthier
of
the
ground
they
trod
book
i
yet
among
all
this
noisy
boyish
fun
and
laughter
strange
keen
love
of
nature
took
root
and
grew
at
times
he
says
even
then
i
felt
gleams
like
the
flashing
of
a
shield
the
earth
and
common
face
of
nature
spake
to
me
rememberable
things
book
i
he
read
too
what
he
liked
spending
many
happy
hours
over
gulliver
travels
and
the
tale
of
a
tub
don
quixote
and
the
arabian
nights
while
wordsworth
was
still
at
school
his
father
died
his
uncles
then
took
charge
of
him
and
after
he
left
school
sent
him
to
cambridge
wordsworth
did
nothing
great
at
college
he
took
his
degree
without
honors
and
left
cambridge
still
undecided
what
his
career
in
life
was
to
be
he
did
not
feel
himself
good
enough
for
the
church
he
did
not
care
for
law
but
rather
liked
the
idea
of
being
a
soldier
that
idea
however
he
also
gave
up
and
for
a
time
he
drifted
in
those
days
one
of
the
world
great
dramas
was
being
enacted
the
french
revolution
had
begun
with
the
great
struggle
the
poet
heart
was
stirred
his
imagination
fired
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
new
dawn
of
freedom
and
joy
and
peace
was
breaking
on
the
world
and
france
lured
him
forth
he
crossed
the
channel
and
for
two
years
he
lived
through
all
the
storm
and
stress
of
the
revolution
he
might
have
ended
his
life
in
the
fearful
reign
of
terror
which
was
coming
on
had
not
his
friends
in
england
called
him
home
he
left
france
full
of
pity
and
sorrow
and
disappointment
for
no
reign
of
peace
had
come
and
the
desire
for
liberty
had
been
swallowed
up
in
the
desire
for
empire
in
spite
of
his
years
of
travel
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
earn
his
living
wordsworth
was
still
unsettled
as
to
what
his
work
in
life
was
to
be
when
a
friend
dying
left
him
nine
hundred
pounds
with
wordworth
simple
tastes
this
sum
was
enough
to
live
upon
for
several
years
so
he
asked
his
dearly
loved
sister
dorothy
to
make
her
home
with
him
and
together
they
settled
down
to
a
simple
cottage
life
in
dorsetshire
it
was
a
happy
thing
for
wordsworth
that
he
found
such
a
comrade
in
his
sister
from
first
to
last
she
was
his
friend
and
helper
cheering
and
soothing
him
when
need
be
her
voice
was
like
a
hidden
bird
that
sang
the
thought
of
her
was
like
a
flash
of
light
or
an
unseen
companionship
a
breath
of
fragrance
independent
of
the
wind
another
poet
samuel
taylor
coleridge
whom
william
and
dorothy
wordsworth
now
met
calls
her
wordsworth
exquisite
sister
she
is
a
woman
indeed
in
mind
i
mean
and
in
heart
in
every
motion
her
innocent
soul
so
brightly
that
who
saw
her
would
say
was
a
thing
impossible
with
her
chapter
lxxv
wordsworth
and
coleridge
the
lake
poets
after
coleridge
and
wordsworth
once
met
they
soon
became
fast
friends
and
in
order
to
be
near
coleridge
the
wordsworths
moved
to
another
house
near
nether
stowey
in
somersetshire
coleridge
was
two
years
or
more
younger
than
wordsworth
having
been
born
in
he
was
the
thirteenth
child
of
his
father
who
was
a
clergyman
as
a
boy
he
was
sensitive
and
lonely
liking
better
to
by
himself
than
to
play
with
his
fellows
while
still
a
mere
child
he
loved
books
before
he
was
five
he
had
read
the
arabian
nights
and
he
peopled
his
day
dreams
with
giants
and
genii
slaves
and
fair
princesses
when
he
was
ten
he
went
to
school
at
christ
hospital
the
bluecoat
school
here
he
met
charles
lamb
who
also
became
a
writer
and
whose
essays
and
tales
from
shakespeare
i
hope
you
will
soon
read
at
school
even
his
fellows
saw
how
clever
coleridge
was
he
read
greedily
and
talked
with
any
one
who
would
listen
and
answer
in
his
lonely
wanderings
about
london
on
leave
days
he
was
delighted
if
he
could
induce
any
stray
to
talk
especially
he
says
if
he
was
dressed
in
black
no
subject
came
amiss
to
him
religion
philosophy
science
or
poetry
from
school
coleridge
went
to
cambridge
but
after
a
time
getting
into
trouble
and
debt
he
ran
away
and
enlisted
in
a
cavalry
regiment
under
the
name
of
silas
tomkyn
comberback
in
a
few
months
however
he
was
discovered
and
his
brothers
bought
him
out
he
then
went
back
to
cambridge
but
left
again
at
the
end
of
the
same
year
without
taking
a
degree
meantime
while
on
a
visit
to
oxford
he
had
met
southey
another
poet
who
was
at
this
time
a
student
there
robert
southey
was
born
in
and
was
the
son
of
a
bristol
linen
draper
but
he
was
brought
up
chiefly
by
an
aunt
in
bath
at
fourteen
he
went
to
school
at
westminster
and
later
to
balliol
college
oxford
when
coleridge
met
him
he
was
just
twenty
and
coleridge
like
wordsworth
they
were
both
fired
with
enthusiasm
for
the
french
revolution
and
they
soon
became
friends
with
some
others
of
like
mind
they
formed
a
little
society
which
they
called
the
pantisocracy
from
greek
words
meaning
rule
they
decided
that
they
should
all
marry
and
then
emigrate
to
the
banks
of
the
susquehanna
chosen
it
has
been
said
because
of
its
beautiful
name
and
there
form
a
little
utopia
property
was
to
be
in
common
each
man
laboring
on
the
land
two
hours
a
day
in
order
to
provide
food
for
the
company
but
the
fine
scheme
came
to
nothing
for
meanwhile
none
of
the
company
had
enough
money
to
pay
for
his
passage
to
the
banks
of
the
river
coleridge
and
southey
however
carried
out
part
of
the
program
they
both
married
their
wives
being
sisters
coleridge
about
the
same
time
as
he
married
published
a
volume
of
poems
but
as
this
did
not
bring
him
wealth
he
then
tried
various
other
ways
of
making
a
living
he
began
a
weekly
paper
which
ceased
after
a
few
numbers
he
lectured
on
history
and
preached
in
various
unitarian
chapels
then
after
a
time
he
settled
at
nether
stowey
where
he
was
living
when
he
met
wordsworth
the
two
poets
as
has
been
said
at
once
became
friends
coleridge
having
a
deep
and
admiration
for
wordworth
genius
i
speak
with
heartfelt
sincerity
he
says
and
i
think
unblinded
judgment
when
i
tell
you
that
i
feel
a
little
man
by
his
side
the
two
friends
had
many
walks
and
talks
together
shaping
their
ideas
of
what
poetry
should
be
they
at
length
decided
to
publish
a
book
together
to
be
called
lyrical
ballads
in
this
book
there
was
published
the
poem
which
of
all
that
coleridge
write
is
the
best
known
the
ancient
mariner
it
tells
how
this
old
old
sailor
stops
a
guest
who
is
going
to
a
wedding
and
bids
him
hear
a
tale
the
wedding
guest
does
not
wish
to
stay
but
the
old
man
holds
him
with
his
skinny
hand
he
holds
him
with
his
glittering
eye
the
wedding
guest
stood
still
and
listens
like
three
years
child
the
mariner
hath
his
will
he
hath
his
will
and
tells
how
the
ship
sailed
forth
gayly
and
how
it
met
after
a
time
with
storms
and
cold
and
fog
until
at
last
it
was
all
beset
with
ice
then
when
to
the
sailors
all
hope
seemed
lost
an
albatross
came
sailing
through
the
fog
with
joy
they
hailed
it
the
only
living
thing
in
that
wilderness
of
ice
they
fed
it
with
delight
it
ate
the
food
it
had
eat
and
round
and
round
it
flew
the
ice
did
split
with
a
the
helmsman
steered
us
through
then
on
they
gladly
sailed
the
albatross
following
until
one
day
the
ancient
mariner
in
a
mad
moment
shot
the
beautiful
bird
in
punishment
for
this
deed
terrible
disasters
fell
upon
that
ship
and
its
crew
under
a
blazing
sun
in
a
hot
and
slimy
sea
filled
with
creeping
crawling
things
they
were
becalmed
day
after
day
day
after
day
we
stuck
nor
breath
nor
motion
as
idle
as
a
painted
ship
upon
a
painted
ocean
then
plague
and
death
came
and
every
man
died
except
the
guilty
mariner
alone
alone
all
all
alone
alone
on
a
wide
wide
sea
and
never
a
saint
took
pity
on
my
soul
in
agony
i
looked
to
heaven
and
tried
to
pray
but
or
ever
a
prayer
had
gush
a
wicked
whisper
came
and
made
my
heart
as
dry
as
dust
but
one
day
as
the
mariner
watched
the
water
snakes
the
only
living
things
in
all
that
dreadful
waste
he
blessed
them
unaware
merely
because
they
were
alive
that
moment
he
found
that
he
could
pray
and
the
albatross
which
his
fellows
in
their
anger
had
hung
about
his
neck
dropped
from
it
and
fell
like
lead
into
the
sea
then
relieved
from
his
terrible
agony
of
soul
the
mariner
slept
and
when
he
woke
he
found
that
the
dreadful
drought
was
over
and
that
it
was
raining
oh
blessed
relief
but
more
terrors
still
he
had
to
endure
until
at
last
the
ship
drifted
homeward
oh
dream
of
joy
is
this
indeed
the
lighthouse
top
i
see
is
this
the
hill
is
this
the
kirk
is
this
mine
own
countree
we
drifted
the
and
i
with
sobs
did
pray
let
me
be
awake
my
god
or
let
me
sleep
alway
the
shop
had
indeed
reached
home
but
in
the
harbor
it
suddenly
sank
like
lead
only
the
mariner
was
saved
when
once
more
he
came
to
land
he
told
his
tale
to
a
holy
hermit
and
was
shriven
but
ever
and
anon
afterward
an
agony
comes
upon
him
and
forces
him
to
tell
the
tale
again
even
as
he
has
just
done
to
the
wedding
guest
and
thus
he
ends
his
story
he
prayeth
best
who
loveth
best
all
things
both
great
and
small
for
the
dear
god
who
loveth
us
he
made
and
loveth
all
then
he
goes
leaving
the
wondering
wedding
guest
alone
the
mariner
whose
eye
is
bright
whose
beard
with
age
is
hoar
is
gone
and
now
the
wedding
guest
turned
from
the
bridegroom
door
he
went
like
one
that
hath
been
stunned
and
is
of
sense
forlorn
a
sadder
and
a
wiser
man
he
rose
the
morrow
morn
among
the
poems
which
wordsworth
wrote
for
the
book
of
lyrical
ballads
was
one
which
every
one
knows
we
are
seven
in
another
called
lines
written
in
early
spring
he
gives
as
it
were
the
text
of
all
his
nature
poems
and
his
creed
for
here
he
tells
us
that
he
believes
that
all
things
in
nature
bird
and
flower
alike
feel
i
heard
a
thousand
blended
notes
while
in
a
grove
i
sate
reclined
in
that
sweet
mood
when
pleasant
thoughts
bring
sad
thoughts
to
the
mind
in
her
fair
works
did
nature
link
the
human
soul
that
through
me
ran
and
much
it
griev
my
heart
to
think
what
man
has
made
of
man
through
primrose
tufts
in
that
sweet
bower
the
periwinkle
trailed
its
wreaths
and
is
my
faith
that
every
flower
enjoys
the
air
it
breathes
the
birds
around
me
hopp
and
play
their
thoughts
i
can
not
measure
but
the
least
motion
that
they
made
it
seemed
a
thrill
of
pleasure
the
budding
twigs
spread
out
their
fan
to
catch
the
breezy
air
and
i
must
think
do
all
i
can
that
there
was
pleasure
there
if
this
belief
from
heaven
be
sent
if
such
be
nature
holy
plan
have
i
not
reason
to
lament
what
man
has
made
of
man
the
book
was
not
a
success
people
did
not
understand
the
ancient
mariner
and
they
laughed
at
wordsworth
simple
lyrics
although
the
last
poem
in
the
book
tintern
abbey
has
since
become
famous
and
is
acknowledged
as
one
of
the
treasures
of
our
literature
and
now
as
this
new
book
was
not
a
success
and
as
he
did
not
seem
able
to
make
enough
money
as
a
poet
coleridge
seriously
began
to
think
of
becoming
a
unitarian
preacher
altogether
but
the
wedgwoods
the
famous
potters
wealthy
men
with
cultured
minds
and
kindly
hearts
offered
him
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
year
if
he
would
give
himself
up
to
poetry
and
philosophy
after
some
hesitation
coleridge
consented
and
that
winter
he
set
off
for
a
visit
to
germany
with
the
wordsworths
it
was
on
their
return
from
this
visit
that
wordsworth
again
changed
his
home
and
went
to
live
at
dove
cottage
near
grasmere
in
the
lake
district
which
as
a
boy
he
had
known
and
loved
and
here
among
the
hills
he
made
his
home
for
the
rest
of
his
life
the
days
at
grasmere
flowed
along
peacefully
and
almost
without
an
event
wordsworth
published
a
second
volume
of
lyrical
ballads
and
then
went
on
writing
and
working
steadily
at
his
long
poem
the
prelude
in
which
he
told
the
story
of
his
early
life
coleridge
soon
followed
his
friend
and
settled
at
greta
hall
keswick
and
there
was
much
coming
and
going
between
dove
cottage
and
greta
hall
at
greta
hall
there
were
two
houses
under
one
roof
and
soon
southey
took
the
second
house
and
came
to
live
beside
his
coleridge
and
so
these
three
poets
having
thus
drifted
together
came
to
be
called
the
lake
poets
although
southey
poetry
had
little
in
common
with
that
of
either
wordsworth
or
coleridge
it
seemed
hardly
to
break
the
peaceful
flow
of
life
at
dove
cottage
when
in
wordsworth
married
his
old
playmate
and
schoolfellow
mary
hutchinson
they
had
known
each
other
all
their
lives
and
marriage
was
a
natural
and
lovely
ending
to
their
friendship
of
her
wordsworth
wrote
she
was
a
phantom
of
delight
when
first
she
gleamed
upon
my
sight
a
lovely
apparition
sent
to
be
a
moment
ornament
her
eyes
as
stars
of
twilight
fair
like
twilight
too
her
dusky
hair
but
all
things
else
about
her
drawn
from
and
the
cheerful
dawn
a
dancing
shape
an
image
gay
to
haunt
to
startle
and
waylay
i
saw
her
upon
nearer
view
a
spirit
yet
a
woman
too
her
household
motions
light
and
free
and
steps
of
a
countenance
in
which
did
meet
sweet
records
promises
as
sweet
a
creature
not
too
bright
and
good
for
human
nature
daily
food
for
transient
sorrows
simple
wiles
praise
blame
love
kisses
tears
and
smiles
and
now
i
see
with
eye
serene
the
very
pulse
of
the
machine
a
being
breathing
thoughtful
breath
a
traveller
between
life
and
death
the
reason
firm
the
temperate
will
endurance
foresight
strength
and
skill
a
perfect
woman
nobly
planned
to
warn
to
comfort
and
command
and
yet
a
spirit
still
and
bright
with
something
of
angelic
light
the
years
passed
in
quiet
fashion
with
friendly
coming
and
goings
with
journeys
here
and
there
now
to
scotland
now
to
the
continent
children
were
born
friends
died
and
once
or
twice
the
wordsworths
changed
their
house
until
they
finally
settled
at
rydal
mount
and
there
the
poet
remained
for
the
rest
of
his
long
life
and
all
the
time
for
more
than
fifty
years
wordsworth
steadily
wrote
but
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
all
his
best
work
was
done
in
the
twenty
years
between
and
besides
the
prelude
of
which
we
have
already
spoken
wordsworth
other
long
poems
are
the
excursion
and
the
white
doe
of
rylstone
the
white
doe
is
a
story
of
the
days
of
queen
elizabeth
of
the
days
when
england
was
still
in
the
midst
of
religious
struggle
there
was
a
rebellion
in
yorkshire
in
which
the
old
lord
of
rylstone
fought
vainly
if
gallantly
for
the
old
religion
and
he
and
his
sons
died
the
death
of
rebels
of
all
the
family
only
the
gentle
emily
remained
doomed
to
be
the
last
leaf
on
a
blasted
tree
about
the
she
wandered
alone
accompanied
only
by
a
white
doe
in
time
she
too
died
then
for
many
years
the
doe
was
seen
alone
it
was
often
to
be
seen
in
the
churchyard
during
service
and
after
service
it
would
go
away
with
the
rest
of
the
congregation
the
excursion
though
a
long
poem
is
only
part
of
what
wordsworth
meant
to
write
he
meant
in
three
books
to
give
his
opinions
on
man
nature
and
society
and
the
whole
was
to
be
called
the
recluse
to
this
great
work
the
prelude
was
to
be
the
introduction
hence
its
name
but
wordsworth
never
finished
his
great
design
and
the
excursion
remains
a
fragment
much
of
the
excursion
can
not
be
called
poetry
at
all
yet
as
one
of
wordsworth
great
admirers
has
said
in
deserts
of
preaching
we
find
delightful
oases
of
poetry
there
is
little
action
in
the
excursion
and
much
of
it
is
merely
dull
descriptions
and
conversations
so
i
would
not
advise
you
to
read
it
for
a
long
time
to
come
but
to
try
rather
to
understand
some
of
wordworth
shorter
poems
although
at
times
their
names
may
seem
less
inviting
one
of
the
most
beautiful
of
all
his
poems
wordsworth
calls
by
the
cumbrous
name
of
intimations
of
immorality
from
recollections
of
early
childhood
this
is
his
way
of
saying
that
when
we
are
small
we
are
nearer
the
than
when
we
grow
up
and
that
when
we
first
open
our
eyes
on
this
world
they
have
not
quite
forgotten
the
wonderful
sights
they
saw
in
that
eternity
whence
we
came
for
the
soul
has
no
beginning
therefore
no
ending
i
will
give
you
here
one
verse
of
this
poem
our
birth
is
but
a
sleep
and
a
forgetting
the
soul
that
rises
with
us
our
life
star
hath
had
elsewhere
its
setting
and
cometh
from
afar
not
in
entire
forgetfulness
and
not
in
utter
nakedness
but
trailing
clouds
of
glory
do
we
come
from
god
who
is
our
home
heaven
lies
about
us
in
our
infancy
shades
of
the
begin
to
close
upon
the
growing
boy
but
he
beholds
the
light
and
whence
it
flows
he
sees
it
in
his
joy
the
youth
who
daily
further
from
the
east
must
travel
still
is
nature
priest
and
by
the
vision
splendid
is
on
his
way
attended
at
length
the
man
perceives
it
die
away
and
fade
into
the
light
of
common
day
wordsworth
for
the
times
in
which
he
lived
traveled
a
good
deal
and
in
his
comings
and
goings
he
made
many
new
friends
and
met
all
the
great
literary
men
of
his
day
and
by
slow
degrees
his
poetry
won
its
way
and
the
younger
men
looked
up
to
him
as
to
a
master
the
great
too
came
to
see
in
him
a
power
since
southey
had
been
laureate
and
when
in
he
died
the
honor
was
given
to
wordsworth
he
was
now
an
old
man
of
three
and
although
he
still
wrote
a
few
poems
he
wrote
nothing
as
laureate
except
an
ode
in
honor
of
the
prince
consort
when
he
became
chancellor
of
cambridge
university
now
as
he
grew
old
one
by
one
death
bade
his
friends
to
leave
him
like
clouds
that
rake
the
mountain
summits
or
waves
that
own
no
curbing
hand
how
fast
has
brother
followed
brother
from
sunshine
to
the
sunless
land
yet
i
whose
lids
from
infant
slumber
were
earlier
raised
remain
to
hear
a
timid
voice
that
asks
in
whispers
next
will
drop
and
disappear
the
death
of
james
hogg
at
length
in
at
the
age
of
eighty
he
too
closed
his
eyes
and
went
from
sunshine
to
the
sunless
land
but
where
will
europe
latter
hour
again
find
wordsworth
healing
power
others
will
teach
us
how
to
dare
and
against
fear
our
breast
to
steel
others
will
strengthen
us
to
bear
but
who
ah
who
will
make
us
feel
books
to
read
poems
of
wordsworth
selected
by
thomson
selections
by
matthew
arnold
chapter
lxxvi
coleridge
and
southey
sunshine
and
shadow
long
before
wordsworth
closed
his
eyes
on
this
world
coleridge
in
some
ways
a
greater
poet
than
his
friend
had
gone
to
his
last
rest
wordsworth
had
a
happy
loving
understanding
of
the
little
things
of
real
life
he
had
an
exquisite
regard
for
common
things
but
his
words
have
seldom
the
glamour
the
something
which
we
can
not
put
into
words
which
makes
us
see
beyond
things
seen
this
coleridge
had
it
is
not
only
his
magic
of
words
it
is
this
trembling
touch
upon
the
unknown
the
unearthly
beauty
and
sadness
of
which
he
makes
us
conscious
in
his
poems
that
marks
him
as
great
and
yet
all
that
coleridge
has
left
us
which
reaches
the
very
highest
is
very
little
but
as
has
been
said
no
english
poet
can
be
put
above
coleridge
when
only
quality
and
not
quantity
is
demanded
of
the
ancient
mariner
i
have
already
told
you
although
perhaps
it
is
too
full
of
fearsomeness
for
you
to
read
yet
next
to
it
stands
christabel
which
is
unfinished
it
is
too
full
of
mysterious
glamour
to
translate
into
mere
prose
so
i
will
not
try
to
tell
the
story
but
here
are
a
few
lines
which
are
very
often
quoted
alas
they
had
been
friends
in
youth
but
whispering
tongues
can
poison
truth
and
constancy
lives
in
realms
above
and
life
is
thorny
and
youth
is
vain
and
to
be
wroth
with
one
we
love
doth
work
like
madness
in
the
brain
and
thus
it
chanced
as
i
divine
with
roland
and
sir
leoline
each
spake
words
of
high
disdain
and
insult
to
his
heart
best
brother
they
parted
to
meet
again
but
never
either
found
another
to
free
the
hollow
heart
from
paining
they
stood
aloof
the
scars
remaining
like
cliff
which
had
been
rent
asunder
a
dreary
sea
now
flows
between
but
neither
heat
nor
frost
nor
thunder
shall
wholly
do
away
i
ween
the
marks
of
that
which
once
had
been
coleridge
singing
time
was
short
all
his
best
poetry
had
been
written
before
he
went
to
live
at
keswick
there
his
health
which
had
never
been
good
gave
way
unhappy
in
his
home
and
racked
with
bodily
pain
he
at
length
began
to
use
opium
in
order
to
find
relief
the
habit
to
which
he
soon
became
a
slave
made
shipwreck
of
his
life
he
had
always
been
unstable
of
purpose
and
weak
of
will
never
keeping
to
one
course
long
he
had
tried
journalism
he
tried
lecturing
he
planned
books
which
were
never
written
his
life
was
a
record
of
beginnings
as
each
new
plan
failed
he
yielded
easily
to
the
temptation
of
living
on
his
friends
he
had
always
been
restless
in
mind
he
left
his
home
and
after
wanderings
now
here
now
there
he
at
length
found
a
home
in
london
with
kind
understanding
friends
of
him
here
we
have
a
pathetic
picture
drawn
by
another
great
man
the
good
man
he
was
now
getting
old
towards
sixty
perhaps
and
gave
you
the
idea
of
a
life
that
had
been
full
of
sufferings
a
life
still
swimming
painfully
in
seas
of
manifold
physical
and
other
bewilderment
brow
and
head
were
round
and
of
massive
weight
but
the
face
was
flabby
and
irresolute
the
deep
eyes
of
a
light
hazel
were
as
full
of
sorrow
as
of
inspiration
confused
pain
looked
mildly
from
them
as
in
a
kind
of
mild
astonishment
the
whole
figure
and
air
good
and
amiable
otherwise
might
be
called
flabby
and
irresolute
expressive
of
weakness
under
possibility
of
strength
a
and
surely
much
suffering
man
and
yet
to
this
giant
men
crowded
eagerly
to
hear
him
talk
never
perhaps
since
the
great
sam
had
held
his
court
had
such
a
talker
been
heard
and
although
there
was
no
boswell
near
to
make
these
conversations
live
again
the
poet
nephew
henry
nelson
coleridge
gathered
some
of
his
sayings
together
into
a
book
which
he
called
table
talk
with
his
good
friends
coleridge
spent
all
his
remaining
life
from
till
when
he
died
meanwhile
his
children
and
his
home
were
left
to
the
care
of
others
and
when
coleridge
threw
off
his
home
ties
and
duties
it
was
upon
southey
that
the
burden
chiefly
fell
and
southey
kindly
and
generous
loving
his
own
children
fondly
loved
and
cared
for
his
nephews
and
nieces
too
we
can
not
regard
southey
as
one
of
our
great
poets
but
when
we
read
his
letters
we
must
love
him
as
a
man
he
wrote
several
long
poems
the
two
best
known
perhaps
are
the
curse
of
kehama
and
thalaba
the
one
a
hindoo
the
other
a
mahometan
story
but
he
is
better
remembered
by
his
short
poems
such
as
the
battle
of
blenheim
and
the
inchcape
rock
for
forty
years
southey
lived
at
greta
hall
and
from
his
letters
we
get
the
pleasantest
picture
of
the
loving
comical
papa
who
had
kept
the
heart
of
a
boy
even
when
his
hair
grew
gray
a
man
he
is
by
nature
merry
somewhat
and
comical
very
who
has
gone
through
the
world
not
mindful
of
self
upon
easy
terms
thank
heaven
with
himself
he
loved
his
books
and
he
loved
the
little
children
that
gathered
about
him
with
pattering
feet
and
chattering
tongues
and
never
wished
to
be
absent
from
them
oh
dear
oh
dear
he
says
there
is
such
a
comfort
in
one
old
coat
and
old
shoes
one
armchair
and
own
fireside
one
own
desk
and
own
library
with
a
little
girl
climbing
up
my
neck
and
saying
go
to
london
papa
you
must
stay
with
edith
and
a
little
boy
whom
i
have
taught
to
speak
the
language
of
cats
dogs
cuckoos
and
jackasses
before
he
can
articulate
a
word
of
his
own
there
is
such
a
comfort
in
all
these
things
the
transportation
to
london
for
four
or
five
weeks
seems
a
heavier
punishment
than
any
sins
of
mine
deserve
and
so
we
see
him
spending
long
hours
long
years
among
his
books
hoping
for
lasting
fame
from
his
poems
and
meantime
earning
with
his
prose
food
for
hungry
little
mouths
shoes
for
nimble
little
feet
with
just
a
trifle
over
for
books
and
still
more
books
for
southey
loved
books
and
his
big
library
was
lined
with
them
there
were
thousands
there
many
in
beautiful
bindings
glowing
in
soft
coloring
gleaming
with
pale
gold
for
he
loved
to
clothe
his
treasures
in
fitting
garments
when
a
new
box
of
books
comes
he
rejoices
i
shall
be
happier
he
says
than
if
his
majesty
king
george
iv
were
to
give
orders
that
i
should
be
clothed
in
purple
and
sleep
upon
gold
and
have
a
chain
about
my
neck
and
sit
next
him
because
of
my
wisdom
and
be
called
his
cousin
we
think
of
southey
first
as
a
poet
but
it
is
perhaps
as
a
prose
writer
that
his
fame
will
last
longest
and
above
all
as
a
biographer
that
is
a
writer
of
people
lives
during
the
busy
years
at
greta
hall
he
wrote
about
a
hundred
books
several
of
them
biographies
among
them
a
life
of
nelson
which
is
one
of
the
best
short
lives
ever
written
some
day
i
hope
you
will
read
it
both
for
the
sake
of
southey
clear
simple
style
and
for
the
sake
of
the
brave
man
of
whom
he
writes
you
might
also
i
think
like
his
lives
of
bunyan
and
cowper
both
of
whom
you
have
heard
of
in
this
book
another
book
which
southey
wrote
is
called
the
doctor
this
is
a
whimsical
rambling
jumble
which
can
hardly
be
called
a
story
a
mixture
of
quotations
and
original
work
of
nonsense
and
earnest
and
in
the
middle
of
it
what
do
you
think
you
come
upon
why
our
old
nursery
friend
the
three
bears
southey
trusts
that
this
book
will
suit
every
one
that
the
lamb
may
wade
in
it
though
the
elephant
may
swim
and
also
that
it
will
be
found
entertaining
to
the
ladies
indeed
he
flatters
himself
that
it
will
be
found
profitable
for
old
and
young
for
men
and
for
women
the
married
and
the
single
the
idle
and
the
studious
the
merry
and
the
sad
and
that
it
may
sometimes
inspire
the
thoughtless
with
thought
and
sometimes
beguile
the
careful
of
their
cares
but
if
it
is
to
be
quite
perfect
it
must
have
a
chapter
for
children
prick
up
your
ears
then
my
good
little
women
and
men
and
ye
who
are
neither
so
little
nor
no
good
favete
linguis
for
here
follows
the
story
of
the
three
bears
so
there
it
is
one
of
them
was
a
little
small
wee
bear
and
one
was
a
sized
bear
and
the
other
was
a
great
huge
bear
and
from
the
way
it
is
told
i
think
we
may
be
sure
that
uncle
robert
or
comical
papa
often
told
stories
with
a
circle
of
eager
bright
faces
round
him
for
he
says
silent
and
was
in
my
vocation
for
their
recreation
that
so
i
should
sing
because
i
was
laureate
to
them
and
the
king
as
the
years
went
on
southey
received
other
honors
besides
the
laureateship
he
was
offered
a
baronetcy
which
he
refused
he
wall
by
oxford
as
he
quaintly
puts
it
in
his
letters
to
his
children
and
when
he
tells
them
about
it
he
says
little
girls
you
know
it
might
be
proper
for
me
now
to
wear
a
large
wig
and
to
be
called
doctor
southey
and
to
become
very
severe
and
leave
off
being
a
comical
papa
however
i
shall
not
come
home
in
my
wig
neither
shall
i
wear
my
robes
at
home
it
is
sad
to
think
that
this
kindly
heard
had
to
bear
the
buffetings
of
ill
fortune
two
of
his
dearly
loved
children
died
then
he
was
parted
from
his
wife
by
worse
than
death
for
she
became
insane
and
remained
so
until
she
died
eight
years
later
robert
southey
was
laid
beside
her
in
the
churchyard
under
the
shadow
of
skiddaw
i
hope
his
life
will
not
be
forgotten
says
macaulay
for
it
is
sublime
in
its
simplicity
its
energy
its
honour
its
affection
his
letter
are
worth
piles

scott
the
awakening
of
romance
the
of
august
was
a
lucky
day
for
all
the
boys
and
girls
and
people
too
of
the
race
for
on
that
day
walter
scott
was
born
in
edinburgh
literature
had
already
begun
to
shake
off
its
fetters
of
art
romance
had
begun
to
stir
in
her
long
sleep
for
six
years
before
sturdy
baby
walter
was
born
bishop
percy
had
published
a
book
called
reliques
of
ancient
english
poetry
in
this
book
he
had
gathered
together
many
old
ballads
and
songs
such
as
those
of
robin
hood
and
patrick
spens
they
had
almost
been
forgotten
and
yet
they
are
poems
which
stir
the
heart
with
their
plaintive
notes
telling
as
they
do
of
old
unhappy
things
and
battles
long
ago
or
is
it
some
more
humble
lay
familiar
matter
of
some
natural
sorrow
loss
or
pain
that
has
been
and
may
be
again
bishop
percy
like
a
knight
of
old
laid
his
lance
in
rest
and
tilted
against
the
prickly
briar
hedge
that
had
grown
up
around
the
sleeping
beauty
romance
but
he
could
not
win
through
and
wake
the
princess
and
although
burns
and
wordsworth
coleridge
and
southey
all
knowing
it
or
not
fought
on
his
side
it
was
left
for
another
knight
to
break
through
the
hedge
and
make
us
free
of
the
enchanted
land
and
that
knight
name
was
walter
sir
walter
too
for
like
a
true
knight
he
won
his
title
in
the
service
of
his
lady
little
walter
father
was
a
kindly
scots
lawyer
but
he
came
of
a
good
old
border
family
a
hardy
race
who
never
shrunk
from
war
among
his
forbears
had
been
wild
and
lairds
of
their
own
lands
as
powerful
as
kings
in
their
own
countryside
there
were
stories
enough
of
their
bold
and
daring
deeds
to
fill
many
books
so
that
we
feel
that
walter
had
been
born
into
a
heritage
of
romance
walter
was
a
strong
healthy
child
but
when
he
was
about
eighteen
months
old
he
had
an
illness
which
left
him
lame
in
his
right
leg
everything
was
done
that
could
be
done
to
restore
the
lost
power
and
although
it
was
partly
regained
scott
walked
with
a
limp
to
the
end
of
his
days
meanwhile
he
had
a
by
no
means
unhappy
childhood
he
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
at
the
farm
belonging
to
his
grandfather
little
wat
was
a
winsome
laddie
and
the
whole
household
loved
him
on
fine
days
he
was
carried
out
and
laid
down
among
the
crags
and
rocks
beside
an
old
shepherd
who
tended
his
sheep
and
little
walter
too
telling
him
strange
tales
the
while
of
forayers
who
with
headlong
force
down
from
that
strength
had
spurr
their
horse
their
southern
rapine
to
renew
far
in
the
distant
cheviots
blue
and
home
returning
fill
the
hall
with
revel
and
brawl
at
other
times
walter
listened
to
the
stories
of
his
grandmother
hearing
all
about
the
wild
doings
of
his
forbears
or
the
brave
deeds
of
bruce
and
wallace
he
was
taken
to
the
seaside
to
bath
and
to
london
and
at
length
grown
into
a
sturdy
little
boy
though
still
lame
he
went
back
to
his
father
house
in
edinburgh
here
he
says
he
soon
felt
the
change
from
being
a
single
indulged
brat
to
becoming
the
member
of
a
large
family
he
now
went
to
school
but
did
not
show
himself
to
be
very
clever
he
was
not
a
dunce
but
an
incorrigibly
idle
imp
and
in
spite
of
his
lameness
he
was
better
at
games
than
at
lessons
in
some
ways
owing
to
his
idleness
he
was
behind
his
fellows
on
the
other
hand
he
had
read
far
more
than
they
and
now
he
read
everything
he
could
in
season
and
out
of
season
homer
shakespeare
ossian
and
especially
spenser
were
among
his
favorites
then
one
happy
day
he
came
upon
a
volume
of
reliques
all
one
summer
day
he
read
and
read
forgetting
the
world
forgetting
even
to
be
hungry
after
that
he
was
for
ever
entertaining
his
schoolfellows
with
scraps
of
tragic
ballads
and
as
soon
as
he
could
scrape
enough
money
together
he
bought
a
copy
of
the
book
for
himself
so
the
years
passed
walter
left
school
went
to
edinburgh
university
and
began
to
study
law
it
was
at
this
time
as
a
boy
of
sixteen
that
for
the
first
and
only
time
he
met
robert
burns
who
had
just
come
to
edinburgh
and
was
delighted
at
receiving
a
kind
word
and
look
from
the
poet
he
still
found
time
to
read
a
great
deal
to
ride
and
to
take
long
rambling
walks
for
in
spite
of
his
limp
he
was
a
great
walker
and
could
go
twenty
or
thirty
miles
indeed
he
used
to
tramp
the
countryside
so
far
and
so
long
that
his
father
would
say
he
feared
his
son
was
born
to
be
nothing
better
than
a
wandering
peddler
after
a
time
it
was
decided
that
walter
should
be
a
barrister
or
as
it
is
called
in
scotland
an
advocate
and
in
he
was
called
to
the
bar
his
work
as
an
advocate
was
at
first
not
very
constant
and
it
left
him
plenty
of
time
for
long
rambling
excursions
or
raids
as
he
used
to
call
them
in
different
parts
of
scotland
and
in
the
north
of
england
he
traveled
about
listening
to
the
ballads
of
the
country
folk
gathering
tales
storing
his
mind
with
memories
of
people
and
places
he
was
making
himself
a
the
time
said
a
friend
who
went
with
him
but
he
didna
ken
maybe
what
he
was
about
till
years
had
passed
at
first
he
thought
o
little
i
daresay
but
the
queerness
and
the
fun
it
was
in
an
expedition
to
the
english
lakes
with
his
brother
and
a
friend
that
scott
met
his
wife
one
day
while
out
riding
he
saw
a
lady
also
riding
she
had
raven
black
hair
and
deep
brown
eyes
which
found
a
way
at
once
to
the
poet
heart
in
true
poet
fashion
he
loved
her
that
night
there
was
a
ball
and
though
walter
scott
could
not
dance
he
went
to
the
ball
and
met
his
lady
love
she
was
charlotte
margaret
carpenter
the
daughter
of
a
frenchman
who
had
taken
refuge
in
england
from
the
fury
of
the
revolution
walter
was
able
to
win
his
lady
heart
and
before
the
end
of
the
year
had
married
her
and
carried
her
off
to
scotland
two
or
three
years
after
his
marriage
scott
published
a
book
of
border
ballads
it
was
the
outcome
of
his
wanderings
in
the
border
country
in
it
scott
had
gathered
together
many
ballads
which
he
heard
from
the
country
folk
but
he
altered
and
bettered
them
as
he
thought
fit
and
among
them
were
new
ballads
by
himself
and
some
of
his
friends
the
book
was
only
a
moderate
success
but
in
it
we
may
find
the
germ
of
all
scott
later
triumphs
for
it
was
the
spirit
of
these
ballads
with
which
his
mind
was
so
full
which
made
it
possible
for
him
to
write
the
metrical
romances
that
made
him
famous
it
is
now
many
chapters
since
we
spoke
of
metrical
romances
they
were
you
remember
the
chief
literature
from
the
twelfth
to
the
fifteenth
century
which
time
was
also
the
time
of
the
early
ballads
and
now
that
people
had
begun
again
to
see
the
beauty
of
ballads
they
were
ready
also
to
turn
again
to
the
simplicity
of
metrical
romances
these
rime
stories
which
scott
now
began
to
write
burst
on
our
island
with
the
splendor
of
something
new
and
yet
it
was
simply
the
spirit
in
which
scott
had
steeped
himself
which
found
a
new
birth
a
renascence
scott
was
a
stalwart
border
chieftain
born
out
of
time
but
as
another
writer
says
instead
of
harrying
cattle
and
cracking
crowns
this
border
chief
was
appointed
to
be
the
and
pleasant
to
britain
and
to
europe
it
was
the
time
for
such
a
new
literature
and
this
walter
scott
was
the
man
for
it
the
mightiest
chiefs
of
british
song
scorn
not
such
legends
to
prolong
they
gleam
through
spenser
elfin
dream
and
mix
in
milton
heavenly
theme
the
first
of
scott
song
stories
was
called
the
lay
of
the
last
minstrel
in
it
he
pictures
an
old
minstrel
the
last
of
all
his
race
wandering
neglected
and
despised
about
the
countryside
but
at
newark
castle
the
seat
of
the
duchess
of
buccleuch
he
receives
kindly
entertainment
when
kindness
had
his
wants
supplied
and
the
old
man
was
gratified
began
to
rise
his
minstrel
pride
and
he
began
to
talk
anon
of
good
earl
francis
dead
and
gone
and
of
earl
walter
rest
him
god
a
braver
to
battle
rode
and
how
full
many
a
tale
he
knew
of
the
old
warriors
of
buccleuch
and
would
the
noble
duchess
deign
to
listen
to
an
old
man
strain
though
stiff
his
hand
his
voice
though
weak
he
though
even
yet
the
sooth
to
speak
that
if
she
loved
the
harp
to
hear
he
could
make
music
to
her
ear
this
humble
boon
was
granted
the
minstrel
was
led
to
the
room
of
state
where
sat
the
duchess
with
her
ladies
and
there
began
his
lay
you
must
read
the
lay
itself
to
learn
about
william
of
deloraine
the
goblin
page
the
lady
margaret
and
lord
canstoun
and
all
the
rest
the
meter
in
which
scott
wrote
was
taken
from
coleridge
christabel
for
though
it
was
not
yet
published
it
had
long
been
in
manuscript
and
scott
had
heard
part
of
it
repeated
by
a
friend
the
lay
of
the
last
minstrel
was
a
success
from
henceforth
scott
was
an
author
but
he
had
no
need
to
write
for
money
as
money
came
to
him
in
other
ways
so
none
of
the
struggles
of
a
rising
author
fell
to
his
lot
his
career
was
simply
a
triumphant
march
and
courteous
scott
took
his
triumphs
joyously
other
poems
followed
the
lay
the
best
being
marmion
and
the
lady
of
the
lake
scott
says
the
lay
is
i
should
say
generally
considered
as
the
most
natural
and
original
marmion
as
the
most
powerful
and
splendid
the
lady
of
the
lake
as
the
most
interesting
romantic
picturesque
and
graceful
of
his
great
poems
fame
and
money
poured
in
upon
scott
and
not
upon
him
only
but
upon
scotland
for
the
new
poet
had
sung
the
beauties
of
the
rugged
country
so
well
that
hundreds
of
english
flocked
to
see
it
for
themselves
scotland
became
the
fashion
and
has
remained
so
ever
since
in
scott
had
been
appointed
of
selkirkshire
and
as
this
obliged
him
to
live
part
of
the
year
at
least
in
the
district
he
rented
a
house
not
far
from
selkirk
but
now
that
he
saw
himself
becoming
wealthy
he
bought
an
estate
in
his
beloved
border
country
and
began
to
build
the
house
of
abbotsford
to
this
house
he
and
his
family
removed
in
may
here
amid
the
noise
of
carpenters
and
masons
with
only
one
room
fit
to
sit
in
and
that
shared
by
chattering
children
he
went
on
with
his
work
to
a
friend
he
writes
as
for
the
house
and
the
poem
there
are
twelve
masons
hammering
at
the
one
and
one
poor
noddle
at
the
other
so
they
are
both
in
progress
it
was
at
abbotsford
that
scott
made
his
home
for
the
rest
of
his
life
here
he
put
off
the
gown
and
wig
of
a
barrister
and
played
the
part
of
a
country
gentleman
he
rode
about
accompanied
by
his
children
and
his
friends
and
followed
by
his
dogs
he
fished
and
walked
and
learned
to
know
every
one
around
high
and
low
he
was
beloved
by
all
the
countryside
for
he
was
kindly
and
courteous
to
all
and
was
aye
the
gentleman
he
would
sit
and
talk
with
a
poor
man
in
his
cottage
listening
to
his
tales
of
long
ago
with
the
same
ease
and
friendliness
as
he
would
entertain
the
great
in
his
own
beautiful
house
and
that
house
was
always
thronged
with
visitors
invited
and
uninvited
with
friends
who
came
out
of
love
of
the
genial
host
with
strangers
who
came
out
of
curiosity
to
see
the
great
novelist
for
great
as
scott
fame
as
a
poet
it
was
nothing
to
the
fame
he
earned
as
a
the
first
story
he
published
was
called
waverley
or
is
sixty
years
since
he
had
begun
to
write
this
tale
years
before
but
had
put
it
aside
as
some
of
his
friends
did
not
think
well
of
it
one
day
he
came
upon
the
manuscript
by
accident
thought
himself
that
the
story
was
worth
something
and
resolved
to
publish
it
finishing
the
writing
in
three
weeks
he
published
the
novel
without
putting
his
name
upon
the
he
did
this
he
said
because
he
thought
it
was
not
quite
dignified
for
a
grave
advocate
and
sheriff
of
the
county
to
write
novels
the
book
was
a
wild
success
everybody
read
it
everybody
was
eager
to
know
who
the
author
was
many
people
guessed
that
it
was
scott
but
for
more
than
ten
years
he
would
not
own
it
at
public
dinners
when
the
health
of
the
author
of
waverley
was
drunk
people
would
look
meaningly
at
scott
but
he
would
appear
quite
unconcerned
and
drink
the
health
and
cheer
with
the
rest
to
keep
the
mystery
up
he
even
reviewed
his
own
books
and
so
curiosity
grew
who
was
this
great
unknown
this
wizard
of
the
north
waverley
is
a
story
of
the
jacobite
times
of
the
rebellion
of
the
hero
edward
waverley
who
is
no
such
great
hero
either
his
author
calling
him
indeed
a
sneaking
piece
of
imbecility
gives
his
name
to
the
book
he
meets
bonnie
prince
charlie
is
present
at
the
famous
ball
at
holyrood
fights
at
the
battle
of
prestonpans
and
marches
with
the
rebel
army
into
england
thus
we
have
the
beginning
of
the
historical
novel
scott
takes
real
people
and
real
incidents
and
with
them
he
interweaves
the
story
of
the
fortunes
of
people
and
incidents
scott
does
not
always
keep
quite
strictly
to
fact
he
is
of
the
same
mind
as
the
old
poet
davenant
who
thought
it
folly
to
take
away
the
liberty
of
a
poet
and
fetter
his
feet
in
the
shackles
of
an
historian
why
he
asked
should
a
poet
not
make
and
mend
a
story
and
frame
it
more
delightfully
merely
because
austere
historians
have
entered
into
a
bond
to
truth
so
scott
takes
liberties
with
history
but
he
always
gives
us
the
spirit
of
the
times
of
which
he
writes
thus
in
one
sense
he
is
true
to
history
and
perhaps
from
waverley
we
get
the
better
idea
of
the
state
of
scotland
at
the
time
of
the
last
jacobite
rebellion
than
from
any
number
of
histories
in
the
next
chapter
scott
himself
shall
give
you
an
account
of
the
battle
of
prestonpans
chapter
lxxviii
scott
the
wizard
of
the
north
the
army
moving
by
its
right
from
off
the
ground
on
which
they
had
rested
soon
entered
the
path
through
the
morass
conducting
their
march
with
astonishing
silence
and
great
rapidity
the
mist
had
not
risen
to
the
higher
grounds
so
that
for
some
time
they
had
the
advantage
of
starlight
but
this
was
lost
as
the
stars
faded
before
approaching
day
and
the
head
of
the
marching
column
continuing
its
descent
plunged
as
it
were
into
the
heavy
ocean
of
fog
which
rolled
its
white
waves
over
the
whole
plain
and
over
the
sea
by
which
it
was
bounded
some
difficulties
were
now
to
be
encountered
inseparable
from
darkness
a
narrow
broken
and
marshy
path
and
the
necessity
of
preserving
union
in
the
march
these
however
were
less
inconvenient
to
highlanders
from
their
habits
of
life
than
they
would
have
been
to
any
other
troops
and
they
continued
a
steady
and
swift
movement
the
clan
of
fergus
had
now
gained
the
firm
plain
which
had
lately
borne
a
large
crop
of
corn
but
the
harvest
was
gathered
in
and
the
expanse
was
unbroken
by
trees
bush
or
interruption
of
any
kind
the
rest
of
the
army
were
following
fast
when
they
heard
the
drums
of
the
enemy
beat
the
general
surprise
however
had
made
no
part
of
their
plan
so
they
were
not
disconcerted
by
this
intimation
that
the
foe
was
upon
his
guard
and
prepared
to
receive
them
it
only
hastened
their
dispositions
for
the
combat
which
were
very
simple
with
your
plaid
waverley
cried
fergus
throwing
off
his
own
win
silks
for
our
tartans
before
the
sun
is
above
the
sea
the
clansmen
on
every
side
stripped
their
plaids
prepared
their
arms
and
there
was
an
awful
pause
of
about
three
minutes
during
which
the
men
pulling
off
their
bonnets
raised
their
faces
to
heaven
and
uttered
a
short
prayer
then
pulled
their
bonnets
over
their
brows
and
began
to
move
forward
at
first
slowly
waverley
felt
his
heart
at
that
moment
throb
as
it
would
have
burst
his
bosom
it
was
not
fear
it
was
not
ardour
it
was
a
compound
of
both
a
new
and
deeply
energetic
impulse
that
with
its
first
emotion
chilled
and
astounded
then
fevered
and
maddened
his
mind
the
sounds
around
him
combined
to
exalt
his
enthusiasm
the
pipes
played
and
the
clans
rushed
forward
each
in
its
own
dark
column
as
they
advanced
they
mended
their
pace
and
the
muttering
sounds
of
the
men
to
each
other
began
to
swell
into
a
wild
cry
at
this
moment
the
sun
which
was
not
risen
above
the
horizon
dispelled
the
mist
the
vapours
rose
like
a
curtain
and
showed
the
two
armies
in
the
act
of
closing
the
line
of
the
regulars
was
formed
directly
fronting
the
attack
of
the
highlanders
it
glittered
with
the
appointments
of
a
complete
army
and
was
flanked
by
cavalry
and
artillery
but
the
sight
impressed
no
terror
on
the
assailants
sons
of
ivor
cried
their
chief
the
camerons
will
draw
the
first
blood
they
rushed
on
with
a
tremendous
yell
the
rest
is
well
known
the
horses
who
were
commanded
to
charge
the
advancing
highlanders
in
the
flank
received
an
irregular
fire
from
their
fusees
as
they
ran
on
and
seized
with
a
disgraceful
panic
wavered
halted
disbanded
and
galloped
from
the
field
the
artillerymen
deserted
by
the
cavalry
fled
after
discharging
their
pieces
and
the
highlanders
who
dropped
their
guns
when
fired
and
drew
their
broadswords
rushed
with
headlong
fury
against
the
infantry
the
english
infantry
trained
in
the
wars
in
flanders
stood
their
ground
with
great
courage
but
their
extended
files
were
pierced
and
broken
in
many
places
by
the
close
masses
of
the
clans
and
in
the
personal
struggle
which
ensued
the
nature
of
the
highlanders
weapons
and
their
extraordinary
fierceness
and
activity
gave
them
a
decided
superiority
over
those
who
had
been
accustomed
to
trust
much
to
their
array
and
discipline
and
felt
that
the
one
was
broken
and
the
other
useless
loud
shouts
now
echoed
over
the
whole
field
the
battle
was
fought
and
won
and
the
whole
baggage
artillery
and
military
stores
of
the
regular
army
remained
a
possession
of
the
victors
never
was
a
victory
more
complete
such
is
scott
picture
of
the
battle
of
prestonpans
and
throughout
the
whole
book
we
have
wonderful
pictures
of
scottish
life
as
it
then
was
pictures
of
robbers
caves
and
halls
of
the
chiefs
themselves
and
their
followers
of
mountain
loch
and
glen
all
drawn
with
such
a
true
and
living
touch
that
we
can
not
forget
them
after
waverley
other
novels
followed
fast
each
one
adding
to
the
reputation
of
the
unknown
author
and
now
from
the
name
of
the
first
we
call
them
all
the
waverley
novels
scott
was
one
of
the
most
wonderful
successes
perhaps
the
most
wonderful
that
has
ever
been
known
in
our
literature
as
long
as
sir
walter
scott
wrote
poetry
said
a
friend
there
was
neither
man
nor
woman
ever
thought
of
either
reading
or
writing
anything
but
poetry
but
the
instant
that
he
gave
over
writing
poetry
there
was
neither
man
nor
woman
ever
read
it
more
all
turned
to
tales
and
novels
hogg
everybody
read
the
novels
from
the
king
to
the
shepherd
friends
money
and
fame
came
tumbling
in
upon
the
author
he
had
refused
to
be
made
poet
laureate
and
passed
the
honor
on
to
southey
but
he
accepted
a
baronetcy
he
added
wing
after
wing
to
his
beautiful
house
and
acre
after
acre
to
his
land
and
rejoiced
in
being
laird
of
abbotsford
the
speed
with
which
scott
wrote
was
marvelous
his
house
was
always
full
of
visitors
yet
he
always
had
time
to
entertain
them
he
was
never
known
to
refuse
to
see
a
friend
gentle
or
simple
and
was
courteous
even
to
the
bores
who
daily
invaded
his
home
he
had
unbounded
energy
he
rose
early
in
the
morning
and
before
the
rest
of
the
family
was
astir
had
finished
more
than
half
of
his
daily
task
of
writing
thus
by
twelve
he
was
free
to
entertain
his
guests
if
ever
man
was
happy
and
successful
scott
seemed
to
be
that
man
but
suddenly
all
his
fair
prospects
were
darkened
over
sir
walter
was
in
some
degree
a
partner
in
the
business
both
of
his
publisher
and
his
printer
now
both
publisher
and
printer
failed
and
scott
found
himself
ruined
with
them
at
he
was
not
only
a
ruined
man
but
loaded
with
a
terrible
debt
of
pounds
it
was
a
staggering
blow
and
most
men
would
have
been
utterly
crushed
by
it
not
so
scott
he
was
proud
proud
of
his
old
name
and
of
his
baronial
hall
he
was
stout
of
heart
too
at
he
began
life
again
determined
with
his
pen
to
wipe
out
the
debt
many
were
the
hands
stretched
out
to
help
him
rich
men
offered
their
thousands
poor
men
their
scanty
savings
but
scott
refused
help
from
both
rich
and
poor
his
own
hand
must
wipe
out
the
debt
he
said
time
was
all
he
asked
so
with
splendid
courage
and
determination
the
like
of
which
has
perhaps
never
been
known
he
set
to
work
but
evil
days
had
begun
for
sir
walter
scarcely
four
months
after
the
crash
his
wife
died
and
so
he
lost
a
companion
of
nearly
thirty
years
i
think
my
heart
will
break
he
cries
in
the
first
bitterness
of
sorrow
lonely
aged
deprived
of
my
family
an
impoverished
an
embarrassed
man
but
dogged
courage
comes
to
him
again
well
that
is
over
and
if
it
can
not
be
forgotten
must
be
remembered
with
patience
so
day
after
day
he
bent
to
his
work
every
morning
saw
his
appointed
task
done
besides
novels
and
articles
he
wrote
a
history
of
napoleon
a
marvelous
book
considering
it
was
written
in
eighteen
months
then
scott
began
the
book
which
will
be
the
first
of
all
his
books
to
interest
you
the
tales
of
a
grandfather
this
is
a
history
of
scotland
and
it
was
written
for
his
grandson
john
hugh
lockhard
or
hugh
littlejohn
as
he
is
called
in
the
tales
i
will
make
said
scott
if
possible
a
book
that
a
child
shall
understand
yet
a
man
shall
feel
some
temptation
to
peruse
should
he
chance
to
take
it
up
hugh
littlejohn
was
a
delicate
boy
indeed
he
had
not
long
to
live
but
many
a
happy
day
he
spent
this
summer
riding
about
the
woods
of
abbotsford
with
his
kind
grandfather
listening
to
the
tales
he
told
for
scott
too
the
rides
were
a
joy
and
helped
to
make
him
forget
his
troubles
when
he
had
told
his
tale
in
such
a
simple
way
that
littlejohn
understood
he
returned
home
and
wrote
it
down
in
the
december
of
the
same
year
the
first
part
of
the
tales
was
published
and
at
once
was
a
tremendous
success
a
success
as
great
almost
as
any
of
the
novels
hugh
littlejohn
liked
the
tales
too
dear
grandpapa
he
writes
i
thank
you
for
the
books
i
like
my
own
picture
and
the
scottish
chief
i
am
going
to
read
them
as
fast
as
i
can
two
more
volumes
of
tales
followed
then
there
was
no
need
to
write
more
for
the
dearly
loved
grandson
as
a
year
or
two
later
when
he
was
only
eleven
poor
littlejohn
died
but
already
the
kind
grandfather
was
near
his
end
also
the
tremendous
effort
which
he
made
to
force
himself
to
work
beyond
his
strength
could
not
be
kept
up
his
health
broke
down
under
it
still
he
struggled
on
but
at
last
yielding
to
his
friends
entreaties
he
went
to
italy
in
search
of
health
and
strength
it
gives
us
some
idea
of
the
high
place
sir
walter
had
won
for
himself
in
the
hearts
of
the
people
when
we
learn
that
his
health
seemed
a
national
concern
and
that
a
warship
was
sent
to
take
him
on
his
journey
but
the
journey
was
of
no
avail
among
the
great
hills
and
blue
lakes
of
italy
scott
longed
for
the
lesser
hills
and
grayer
lochs
of
scotland
so
he
turned
homewards
and
at
home
in
his
beloved
abbotsford
in
the
still
splendor
of
an
autumn
day
with
the
air
he
loved
fanning
his
face
and
the
sound
of
rippling
tweed
in
his
ears
he
closed
his
eyes
for
ever
in
the
ruin
of
dryburgh
abbey
not
far
from
his
home
he
was
laid
to
rest
while
the
whole
countryside
mourned
sir
walter
before
he
died
scott
had
paid
pounds
of
his
debt
an
enormous
sum
for
one
man
to
make
by
his
pen
in
six
years
he
died
in
the
happy
belief
that
all
was
paid
as
indeed
it
all
was
for
after
the
author
death
his
books
still
brought
in
a
great
deal
of
money
so
that
in
fifteen
years
the
debt
was
wiped
out
i
have
not
told
you
any
of
scott
stories
here
because
unlike
many
of
the
books
we
have
spoken
of
they
are
easily
to
be
had
and
the
time
will
soon
come
if
it
has
not
come
already
when
you
can
read
sir
walter
books
just
as
he
wrote
them
it
is
best
i
think
that
you
should
read
them
so
for
sir
walter
scott
is
perhaps
the
first
of
all
our
great
writers
nearly
the
whole
of
whose
books
a
child
can
read
without
help
you
will
find
many
long
descriptions
in
them
but
do
not
let
them
frighten
you
you
need
not
read
them
all
the
first
time
and
very
likely
you
will
want
to
read
them
the
second
time
but
perhaps
before
you
read
his
novels
you
will
like
to
read
his
metrical
romances
for
when
we
are
children
big
children
perhaps
but
still
children
is
the
time
to
read
them
long
ago
in
the
twelfth
century
when
the
people
of
england
were
simple
and
unlearned
they
loved
metrical
romances
and
we
when
we
are
simple
and
unlearned
may
love
them
too
many
of
these
old
romances
however
are
hard
to
get
and
they
are
written
in
a
language
hard
for
many
of
us
to
understand
but
sir
walter
scott
in
the
nineteenth
century
has
recreated
for
us
all
the
charm
of
those
old
tales
for
this
then
let
us
thank
and
remember
him
his
legendary
song
could
tell
of
ancient
deeds
so
long
forgot
of
feuds
whose
memory
was
not
of
forests
now
laid
waste
and
bare
of
towers
which
harbour
now
the
hare
of
manners
long
since
chang
and
gone
of
chiefs
who
under
their
grey
stone
so
long
had
slept
that
fickle
fame
had
blotted
from
her
rolls
their
name
and
twin
round
some
new
minion
head
the
fading
wreath
for
which
they
bled
of
the
last
minstrel
chapter
lxxix
byron
childe
harold
pilgrimage
when
sir
walter
scott
ceased
to
write
metrical
romances
he
said
it
was
because
byron
had
beaten
him
but
the
metrical
romances
of
these
two
poets
are
widely
different
with
sir
walter
we
are
up
among
the
hills
out
on
the
wide
moorland
with
him
we
tramp
the
heather
and
ford
the
rushing
streams
his
poems
are
full
of
healthy
generous
life
with
byron
we
seem
rather
to
be
in
the
close
air
of
a
theater
his
poems
do
not
tell
of
a
rough
and
vigorous
life
but
of
luxury
and
softness
of
tyrants
and
slaves
of
beautiful
houris
and
dreadful
villains
and
in
the
villains
we
always
seem
to
see
byron
himself
who
tries
to
impress
us
with
the
fact
that
he
is
indeed
a
very
bold
bad
man
in
his
poetry
there
is
something
artificial
which
takes
us
backward
to
the
time
of
pope
rather
than
forward
with
the
nature
poets
the
boyhood
of
george
gordon
byron
was
a
sad
one
he
came
of
an
ancient
and
noble
family
but
one
which
in
its
later
generations
had
become
feeble
almost
to
madness
his
father
who
was
called
mad
jack
was
wild
and
worthless
his
mother
was
a
wealthy
woman
but
weak
and
passionate
and
in
a
short
time
after
her
marriage
her
husband
spent
nearly
all
her
money
byron
then
took
her
little
baby
and
went
to
live
quietly
in
aberdeen
on
what
was
left
of
her
fortune
she
was
a
weak
and
passionate
woman
and
sometimes
she
petted
and
spoiled
her
little
boy
sometimes
she
treated
him
cruelly
calling
him
a
lame
brat
than
which
nothing
could
hurt
him
more
for
poor
little
george
was
born
lame
and
all
his
life
long
he
felt
sore
and
angry
about
it
to
him
too
had
been
given
the
passionate
temper
of
both
father
and
mother
and
when
he
was
angry
he
would
fall
into
silent
rages
bite
pieces
out
of
saucers
or
tear
his
pinafores
to
bits
meanwhile
while
in
aberdeen
byron
struggled
to
live
on
pounds
a
year
in
newstead
abbey
near
nottingham
there
lived
a
queer
old
who
had
earned
for
himself
the
name
of
the
wicked
lord
he
knew
well
enough
that
when
he
died
the
little
boy
in
aberdeen
with
the
pretty
face
and
lame
foot
would
become
lord
byron
he
might
have
taken
some
interest
in
his
nephew
and
seen
at
least
that
he
was
sent
to
school
and
given
an
education
to
fit
him
for
his
future
place
in
the
world
but
that
was
not
the
wicked
lord
way
he
paid
no
attention
to
the
little
boy
in
aberdeen
indeed
it
is
said
that
he
hated
him
and
that
he
cut
down
his
trees
and
despoiled
newstead
as
much
as
he
could
in
order
to
leave
his
heir
as
poor
a
heritage
as
possible
but
when
george
was
ten
this
old
uncle
died
then
mother
and
son
said
to
aberdeen
and
at
length
traveled
southwards
to
take
possession
of
their
great
house
and
broad
lands
but
the
heritage
was
not
so
great
as
at
first
sight
would
appear
for
the
house
was
so
ruinous
that
it
was
scarcely
fit
to
live
in
and
the
wicked
lord
had
sold
some
of
the
land
however
as
the
sale
was
unlawful
after
much
trouble
the
land
was
recovered
byron
had
now
to
take
his
place
among
boys
of
his
own
class
and
when
he
was
thirteen
he
was
sent
to
school
at
harrow
but
he
hated
school
he
was
shy
as
a
wild
mountain
colt
and
somewhat
snobbish
and
at
first
was
most
unpopular
as
he
says
himself
however
he
fought
his
way
very
fairly
and
he
formed
some
friendships
passionately
as
he
did
everything
in
spite
of
his
lameness
he
was
good
at
sports
especially
at
swimming
he
was
brave
and
even
if
his
snobbishness
earned
for
him
the
nickname
of
the
old
english
baron
his
comrades
admired
his
spirit
and
in
the
end
instead
of
being
unpopular
he
led
often
to
mischief
i
was
he
says
always
cricketing
rebelling
fighting
rowing
from
row
not
a
different
practice
and
in
all
manner
of
mischiefs
yet
wild
though
he
was
of
his
headmaster
he
ever
kept
a
kindly
remembrance
drury
he
says
whom
i
plagued
sufficiently
too
was
the
best
the
kindest
friend
i
ever
had
byron
hated
harrow
until
his
last
year
and
a
half
there
then
he
liked
it
and
when
he
knew
he
must
leave
and
go
to
cambridge
he
was
so
unhappy
that
he
counted
the
days
that
remained
not
with
joy
at
the
thought
of
leaving
but
with
sorrow
at
cambridge
he
felt
himself
lonely
and
miserable
at
first
as
he
had
at
school
but
there
too
he
soon
made
friends
he
found
plenty
of
time
for
games
he
rode
and
shot
rejoiced
in
feats
of
swimming
and
diving
he
wrote
poetry
also
which
he
afterwards
published
under
the
name
of
hours
of
idleness
it
was
a
good
name
for
the
book
for
indeed
he
was
so
idle
in
his
proper
studies
that
the
wonder
is
that
he
was
able
to
take
his
degree
it
was
in
at
the
age
of
nineteen
that
lord
byron
published
his
hours
of
idleness
with
a
rather
pompous
preface
the
poems
were
not
great
some
of
them
indeed
were
nothing
less
than
mawkish
but
perhaps
they
did
not
deserve
the
slashing
review
which
appeared
in
the
edinburgh
review
the
edinburgh
review
was
a
magazine
given
at
this
time
to
criticising
authors
very
severely
and
byron
had
to
suffer
no
more
than
other
and
greater
poets
but
he
trembled
with
indignation
and
his
anger
called
forth
his
first
really
good
poem
called
english
bards
and
scotch
reviewers
it
is
a
satire
after
the
style
of
pope
and
in
it
byron
lashes
not
only
his
reviewers
but
also
other
writers
of
his
day
his
criticisms
are
many
of
them
quite
wrong
and
in
after
years
when
he
came
to
know
the
men
he
now
decried
he
regretted
this
poem
and
declared
it
should
never
be
printed
again
but
it
is
still
included
in
his
works
perhaps
having
just
read
about
sir
walter
scott
it
may
amuse
you
to
read
what
byron
has
to
say
of
him
thus
lays
of
minstrels
may
they
be
the
last
on
harps
whine
mournful
to
the
blast
while
mountain
spirits
prate
to
river
sprites
that
dames
may
listen
to
the
sound
at
nights
next
view
in
state
proud
prancing
on
his
roan
the
haughty
marmion
now
forging
scrolls
now
foremost
in
the
fight
not
quite
a
felon
yet
but
half
a
knight
the
gibbet
or
the
field
prepared
to
grace
a
mighty
mixture
of
the
great
and
base
and
thou
scott
by
vain
conceit
perchance
on
public
taste
to
foist
thy
stale
romance
then
after
a
sneer
at
scott
for
making
money
by
his
poems
byron
concludes
with
this
passage
these
are
the
themes
that
claim
our
plaudits
now
these
are
the
bards
to
whom
the
muse
must
bow
while
milton
dryden
pope
alike
forgot
resign
their
hallowed
bays
to
walter
scott
when
people
read
this
satire
they
realized
that
a
new
poet
had
appeared
but
it
was
not
until
byron
published
his
first
long
poem
called
childe
harold
pilgrimage
that
he
became
famous
then
his
success
was
sudden
and
amazing
i
woke
up
one
morning
and
found
myself
famous
he
says
his
fame
says
another
poet
and
friend
who
wrote
his
life
seemed
to
spring
up
like
the
palace
of
a
fairy
tale
in
a
night
he
was
praised
and
lauded
by
high
and
low
every
one
was
eager
to
known
him
and
for
a
time
he
became
the
spoiled
darling
of
society
childe
harold
is
a
long
poem
of
four
cantos
but
now
only
two
cantos
were
published
the
third
was
added
in
the
fourth
in
it
is
written
in
the
spenserian
stanza
with
here
and
there
songs
and
ballads
in
other
meters
and
in
the
first
few
verses
there
is
even
an
affectation
of
spenserian
wording
but
the
poet
soon
grew
tired
of
that
and
returned
to
his
own
english
childe
is
used
in
the
ancient
sense
of
knight
and
the
poem
tells
of
the
wanderings
of
a
gloomy
vicious
man
there
is
very
little
story
in
childe
harold
the
poem
is
more
a
series
of
descriptions
and
a
record
of
the
thoughts
that
are
called
forth
by
the
places
through
which
the
traveler
passes
it
is
indeed
a
poetic
diary
the
pilgrim
visits
many
famous
spots
among
them
the
field
of
waterloo
where
but
a
few
months
before
the
fate
of
europe
had
been
decided
to
us
the
battle
of
waterloo
is
a
long
way
off
to
byron
it
was
still
a
deed
of
yesterday
as
he
approaches
the
field
he
feels
that
he
is
on
sacred
ground
stop
for
thy
tread
is
on
an
empire
dust
an
earthquake
spoil
is
sepulchred
below
is
the
spot
marked
with
no
colossal
bust
nor
column
trophied
for
triumphal
show
none
but
the
moral
truth
tells
simpler
so
as
the
ground
was
before
thus
let
is
be
how
that
red
rain
hath
made
the
harvest
grow
and
is
this
all
the
world
has
gain
by
thee
thou
first
and
last
of
field
kingmaking
victory
then
in
thought
byron
goes
over
all
that
took
place
that
fateful
day
there
was
a
sound
of
revelry
by
night
and
belgium
capital
had
gather
then
her
beauty
and
her
chivalry
and
bright
the
lamps
shone
fair
women
and
brave
men
a
thousand
hearts
beat
happily
and
when
music
arose
with
its
voluptuous
swell
soft
eyes
look
love
to
eyes
which
spake
again
and
all
went
merry
as
a
marriage
bell
but
hush
hark
a
deep
sound
strikes
a
rising
knell
did
ye
not
hear
it
no
was
but
the
wind
or
the
car
rattling
the
stony
street
on
with
the
dance
let
joy
be
unconfined
no
sleep
till
morn
when
youth
and
pleasure
meet
to
chase
the
glowing
hours
with
flying
feet
but
hark
that
heavy
sound
breaks
in
once
more
as
if
the
clouds
its
echo
would
repeat
and
nearer
clearer
deadlier
than
before
arm
arm
it
is
it
is
the
cannon
opening
roar
ah
then
and
there
was
hurrying
to
and
fro
and
gathering
tears
and
tremblings
of
distress
and
cheeks
all
pale
which
but
an
hour
ago
blush
at
the
praise
of
their
own
loveliness
and
there
were
sudden
parting
such
as
press
the
life
from
out
young
hearts
and
choking
sighs
which
might
be
repeated
who
could
guess
if
ever
more
should
meet
those
mutual
eyes
since
upon
night
so
sweet
such
awful
morn
could
rise
and
there
was
mounting
in
hot
haste
the
steed
the
mustering
squadron
and
the
clattering
car
went
pouring
forward
with
impetuous
speed
and
swiftly
forming
in
the
ranks
of
war
and
the
deep
thunder
peal
on
peal
afar
and
near
the
beat
of
the
alarming
drum
roused
up
the
soldier
ere
the
morning
star
while
throng
the
citizens
with
terror
dumb
or
whispering
with
white
lips
foe
they
come
they
come
and
then
thinking
of
the
battle
lost
by
the
great
conqueror
of
europe
the
poet
mourns
for
him
conqueror
and
captive
of
the
earth
art
thou
she
trembles
at
thee
still
and
thy
wild
name
was
more
bruited
in
men
minds
than
now
that
thou
are
nothing
save
the
jest
of
fame
who
woo
thee
once
thy
vassal
and
became
the
flatterer
of
thy
fierceness
till
thou
wert
a
god
unto
thyself
nor
less
the
same
to
thee
astounded
kingdoms
all
inert
who
deem
thee
for
a
time
thou
didst
assert
oh
more
or
less
than
man
in
high
or
low
battling
with
nations
flying
from
the
field
now
making
monarchs
necks
thy
footstool
now
more
than
thy
meanest
soldier
taught
to
yield
an
empire
thou
couldst
crush
command
rebuild
but
govern
not
thy
pettiest
passion
nor
however
deeply
in
men
spirits
skill
look
through
thine
own
nor
curb
the
lust
of
war
nor
learn
that
tempted
fate
will
eave
the
loftiest
star
these
are
a
few
verses
from
one
of
the
best
known
parts
of
childe
harold
there
are
many
other
verses
equally
well
known
they
have
become
the
possession
of
almost
every
schoolboy
some
of
them
you
will
read
in
school
books
and
when
you
are
grown
up
and
able
to
distinguish
between
what
is
vulgar
and
what
is
good
and
beautiful
in
it
i
hope
you
will
read
the
whole
poem
for
two
years
byron
was
as
popular
as
man
might
be
then
came
a
change
from
the
time
that
he
was
a
child
he
had
always
been
in
love
first
with
one
and
then
with
another
his
heart
was
tinder
ever
ready
to
take
fire
now
he
married
at
first
all
went
well
one
little
baby
girl
was
born
then
troubles
came
troubles
which
have
never
been
explained
and
for
which
we
need
not
seek
an
explanation
now
and
one
day
lady
byron
left
her
husband
never
to
return
the
world
which
had
petted
and
spoiled
the
poet
now
turned
from
the
man
he
was
abused
and
decried
instead
of
being
courted
he
was
shunned
so
in
anger
and
disgust
byron
left
the
country
where
he
found
no
sympathy
he
never
returned
to
it
the
rest
of
his
life
being
spent
as
a
wanderer
upon
the
continent
it
was
to
a
great
extent
a
misspent
life
and
yet
while
byron
wasted
himself
in
unworthy
ways
he
wrote
constantly
and
rapidly
pouring
out
volumes
of
poetry
at
a
speed
equaled
only
by
scott
he
wrote
tragedies
metrical
romances
lyrics
and
everything
that
he
wrote
was
read
not
only
at
home
but
on
the
continent
and
one
thing
that
we
must
remember
byron
for
is
that
he
made
english
literature
continental
before
he
came
says
an
italian
patriot
and
writer
all
that
was
known
of
english
literature
was
the
french
translation
of
shakespeare
it
is
since
byron
that
we
continentalists
have
learned
to
study
shakespeare
and
other
english
writers
from
him
dates
the
sympathy
of
all
the
amongst
us
for
this
land
of
liberty
he
led
the
genius
of
britain
on
a
pilgrimage
throughout
all
europe
much
that
byron
wrote
was
almost
worthless
he
has
none
of
the
haunting
sense
of
the
beauty
of
words
in
perfect
order
that
marks
the
greatest
poets
he
has
no
passion
for
the
correct
use
of
words
and
often
his
song
seems
tuneless
and
sometimes
vulgar
for
in
byron
undisciplined
turgid
soul
there
is
a
strain
of
coarseness
and
vulgarity
which
not
seldom
shows
itself
in
his
poetry
spoiling
some
of
his
most
beautiful
lines
his
poetry
is
egotistical
too
that
is
it
is
full
of
himself
and
again
and
again
it
has
been
said
that
byron
was
always
his
own
hero
he
never
had
more
than
a
singe
subject
himself
no
man
has
ever
pushed
egotism
further
than
he
in
all
his
dark
and
gloomy
heroes
we
see
lord
byron
and
it
is
not
only
himself
which
he
gives
to
the
world
gaze
but
his
wrongs
and
his
sorrows
yet
in
spite
of
all
its
faults
there
is
enough
that
is
purely
beautiful
in
his
work
to
give
byron
rank
as
a
poet
he
has
been
placed
on
a
level
with
wordsworth
one
cultured
writer
whose
judgment
on
literature
we
listen
to
with
respect
has
said
wordsworth
and
byron
stand
out
by
themselves
when
the
year
is
turned
and
our
nation
comes
to
recount
her
poetic
glories
of
the
century
which
has
then
just
ended
the
first
names
with
her
will
be
these
but
there
are
many
who
will
deny
him
this
high
rank
he
can
only
claim
to
be
acknowledged
as
a
poet
of
the
third
class
says
another
great
poet
who
now
and
then
rises
into
the
second
but
speedily
relapses
into
the
lower
element
where
he
was
born
and
yet
another
has
said
that
his
poetry
fills
the
great
space
through
which
our
literature
has
moved
from
the
time
of
johnson
to
the
time
of
wordsworth
it
touches
the
essay
of
at
the
one
extremity
and
the
excursion
at
the
other
so
you
see
byron
place
in
our
literature
is
hardly
settled
yet
pope
when
byron
left
england
he
fled
from
the
contempt
of
his
fellows
his
life
on
the
continent
did
little
to
lessen
that
contempt
but
before
he
died
he
redeemed
his
name
from
the
scorner
long
ago
you
remember
at
the
time
of
the
renaissance
greece
had
been
conquered
by
the
turks
hundreds
of
years
passed
and
greece
remained
in
a
state
of
slavery
but
by
degrees
new
life
began
to
stir
among
the
people
and
in
a
war
of
independence
broke
out
at
first
the
other
countries
of
europe
stood
aloof
but
gradually
their
sympathies
were
drawn
to
the
little
nation
making
so
gallant
a
fight
for
freedom
and
this
struggle
woke
all
that
was
generous
in
the
heart
of
byron
the
worn
man
of
the
world
like
his
own
childe
harold
with
pleasure
drugg
he
almost
long
for
woe
so
to
greece
he
went
and
the
last
nine
months
of
his
life
were
spent
to
such
good
purpose
that
when
he
died
the
whole
greek
nation
mourned
he
had
hoped
to
die
sword
in
hand
but
that
was
not
to
be
his
body
was
worn
with
reckless
living
and
could
ill
bear
any
strain
one
day
when
out
for
a
long
ride
he
became
heated
and
then
soaked
by
a
shower
of
rain
rheumatic
fever
followed
and
ten
days
later
he
lay
dead
he
was
only
all
greece
mourned
for
the
loss
of
such
a
generous
friend
cities
vied
with
each
other
for
the
honor
of
his
tomb
and
when
his
friends
decided
that
his
body
should
be
carried
home
to
england
homage
as
to
a
prince
was
paid
to
it
as
it
passed
through
the
streets
on
its
last
journey
the
sword
the
banner
and
the
field
glory
and
greece
around
me
see
the
spartan
borne
upon
his
shield
was
not
more
free
awake
not
greece
she
is
awake
awake
my
spirit
think
through
whom
thy
tracks
its
parent
lake
and
then
strike
home
tread
those
reviving
passions
down
unworthy
manhood
unto
thee
indifferent
should
the
smile
or
frown
of
beauty
be
if
thou
thy
youth
why
live
the
land
of
honourable
death
is
here
up
to
the
field
and
give
away
thy
breath
seek
out
less
often
sought
than
found
a
soldier
grave
for
thee
the
best
then
look
around
and
choose
thy
ground
and
take
thy
rest
these
lines
are
from
byron
last
poem
written
on
his
sixth
birthday
chapter
lxxx
shelley
the
poet
of
love
when
byron
wandered
upon
the
continent
he
met
and
made
friends
with
another
poet
a
greater
than
himself
this
poet
was
called
percy
bysshe
shelley
and
of
him
i
am
going
to
tell
you
something
in
this
chapter
on
the
of
august
percy
bysshe
shelley
was
born
at
field
place
near
the
village
of
warnham
in
sussex
his
father
a
man
was
of
a
good
family
and
heir
to
a
baronetcy
his
mother
was
a
beautiful
woman
of
the
early
childhood
of
bysshe
we
know
nothing
except
that
at
the
age
of
six
he
was
daily
taught
latin
by
a
clergyman
when
we
next
hear
of
him
he
is
a
big
boy
the
hero
of
the
nursery
with
four
little
sisters
and
a
wee
toddling
baby
brother
to
all
of
whom
he
loved
to
play
big
brother
his
sisters
would
often
sit
on
his
knee
and
listen
to
the
wonderful
tales
he
told
there
were
stories
of
the
great
tortoise
which
lived
in
a
pond
near
true
the
great
tortoise
was
never
seen
but
that
made
it
all
the
more
mysterious
and
wonderful
and
any
unusual
noise
was
put
down
to
the
great
tortoise
there
were
other
stories
about
the
great
old
snake
which
lived
in
the
garden
this
really
was
seen
and
perhaps
it
was
the
same
serpent
which
two
hundred
years
before
had
been
known
to
lurk
about
the
countryside
he
could
jut
out
his
neck
an
ell
it
was
said
and
cast
his
venom
about
four
rods
a
serpent
of
countenance
very
proud
at
the
sight
or
hearing
of
men
or
cattle
raising
his
head
seeming
to
listen
and
look
about
with
great
arrogancy
but
if
it
was
this
same
serpent
it
had
lost
its
venom
and
in
the
days
when
bysshe
and
his
sisters
played
about
the
garden
they
looked
upon
it
as
a
friend
one
day
however
a
gardener
killed
it
by
mistake
when
he
was
cutting
the
grass
with
a
scythe
so
there
was
an
end
of
the
great
old
snake
but
the
tortoise
and
the
snake
were
not
the
only
wonderful
things
about
field
place
there
was
a
big
garret
which
was
never
used
with
beneath
it
a
secret
room
the
only
entrance
to
which
was
through
a
plank
in
the
garret
floor
this
according
to
the
big
brother
was
the
of
an
alchemist
old
and
grey
with
a
long
beard
here
with
his
lamp
and
magic
books
he
wrought
his
wonders
and
some
day
the
eager
children
were
promised
a
visit
to
him
meanwhile
bysshe
himself
played
the
alchemist
and
with
his
sisters
dressed
up
in
strange
costumes
to
represent
fiends
or
spirits
he
ran
about
with
liquid
fire
until
this
dangerous
play
was
stopped
then
he
made
an
electric
battery
and
amused
himself
by
giving
his
sisters
shocks
to
the
secret
terror
of
at
least
one
of
them
whose
heart
would
sink
with
fear
when
she
saw
her
brother
appear
with
a
roll
of
brown
paper
a
bit
of
wire
and
a
bottle
but
one
day
she
could
not
hide
her
terror
any
longer
and
after
that
the
kind
big
brother
never
worried
her
any
more
to
have
shocks
sometimes
too
their
games
took
them
further
afield
and
led
by
bysshe
the
children
went
on
long
rambles
through
woods
and
meadows
climbing
walls
and
scrambling
through
hedges
and
coming
home
tired
and
muddy
bysshe
was
so
happy
with
his
sisters
and
little
brother
that
he
decided
to
buy
a
little
girl
and
bring
her
up
as
his
own
one
day
a
little
gypsy
girl
came
to
the
back
door
and
he
though
she
would
do
very
well
his
father
and
mother
however
thought
otherwise
so
the
little
girl
was
not
bought
but
the
boy
who
was
so
lively
with
his
sisters
at
times
was
quiet
and
thoughtful
sometimes
he
would
slip
out
of
the
house
on
moonlight
nights
his
anxious
parents
would
then
send
an
old
servant
after
him
who
would
return
to
say
that
master
bysshe
only
took
a
walk
and
came
back
again
a
very
strange
form
of
amusement
it
must
have
seemed
to
his
plain
father
but
now
these
careless
happy
days
came
to
an
end
or
only
returned
during
holiday
times
for
when
bysshe
was
ten
years
old
he
was
sent
to
school
shelley
went
first
to
a
private
school
and
after
a
year
or
two
to
eton
but
at
neither
was
he
happy
and
although
he
had
been
so
merry
at
home
at
school
he
was
looked
upon
as
a
strange
unsociable
creature
he
refused
to
fag
for
the
bigger
boys
he
never
joined
in
the
ordinary
school
games
and
would
wander
about
by
himself
reading
or
watching
the
clouds
and
the
birds
he
read
all
kinds
of
books
liking
best
those
which
told
of
haunted
castles
robbers
giants
murderers
and
other
eerie
subjects
he
liked
chemistry
too
and
was
more
than
once
brought
into
trouble
by
the
daring
experiments
he
made
shelley
was
very
brave
and
never
afraid
of
anything
except
what
was
base
and
low
to
the
few
who
loved
him
he
was
gentle
but
most
of
his
schoolfellows
took
delight
in
tormenting
him
and
when
goaded
into
wrath
he
showed
that
he
could
be
fierce
shelley
soon
began
to
write
and
while
still
at
school
at
the
age
of
sixteen
he
published
a
novel
for
which
he
received
pounds
a
little
later
he
and
one
of
his
sisters
published
a
book
of
poems
together
from
eton
shelley
went
to
oxford
here
he
remained
for
a
few
months
reading
hard
he
was
to
be
found
book
in
hand
at
all
hours
reading
in
season
and
out
of
season
at
table
in
bed
and
especially
during
a
walk
but
he
read
more
what
pleased
himself
than
what
pleased
the
college
authorities
he
wrote
too
and
among
the
things
he
wrote
was
a
little
leaflet
of
a
few
pages
which
seemed
to
the
fellows
of
his
college
a
dangerous
attack
upon
religion
they
summoned
shelley
to
appear
before
them
and
as
he
refused
to
answer
their
questions
he
was
expelled
shelley
had
given
himself
the
name
of
atheist
it
is
a
very
ugly
name
meaning
one
who
denies
the
existence
of
god
looking
back
now
we
can
see
that
it
was
too
harsh
and
ugly
a
name
for
shelley
the
paper
for
which
he
was
expelled
even
if
it
was
wicked
was
the
work
of
a
rash
impetuous
boy
not
the
reasoned
wickedness
of
a
grown
man
but
the
deed
was
done
and
shelley
was
thrown
out
into
the
world
for
his
father
sorely
vexed
and
troubled
not
knowing
how
to
control
his
wild
colt
of
a
son
refused
to
allow
him
to
return
home
so
shelley
remained
in
london
here
he
went
often
to
visit
his
sisters
at
school
and
came
to
known
one
of
their
school
friends
harriet
westbrook
she
was
a
pretty
tempered
girl
of
sixteen
with
hair
like
a
poet
dream
shelley
thought
that
she
too
was
oppressed
and
as
he
had
been
she
loved
him
he
liked
her
so
they
decided
to
get
married
and
ran
away
to
scotland
and
were
married
in
edinburgh
shelley
was
nineteen
and
his
little
bride
sixteen
this
boy
and
girl
marriage
was
a
terrible
mistake
and
three
years
later
husband
and
wife
separated
i
can
tell
you
very
little
more
of
shelley
life
some
of
it
was
wrong
much
of
it
was
sad
as
it
could
hardly
fail
to
be
following
on
this
wrong
beginning
when
you
grow
older
you
will
be
able
to
read
it
with
charity
and
understanding
meantime
keep
the
picture
of
the
kindly
big
brother
and
imagine
him
growing
into
a
lovable
and
brave
man
into
a
poet
who
wins
our
hearts
almost
unawares
by
the
beauty
of
his
poetry
his
poetry
which
has
been
called
a
beautiful
dream
of
the
future
of
some
of
it
i
shall
now
tell
you
a
little
very
early
shelley
began
to
publish
poetry
but
most
of
it
was
not
worthy
of
a
truly
great
poet
his
first
really
fine
poem
is
alastor
it
is
written
in
blank
verse
and
represents
a
poet
seeking
in
vain
for
his
ideal
of
what
is
truly
lovely
and
beautiful
being
unable
to
find
that
which
he
seeks
he
dies
the
poem
is
full
of
beautiful
description
but
it
is
sad
and
in
the
picture
of
the
poet
we
seem
to
see
shelley
himself
other
long
poems
followed
poems
which
are
both
terrible
and
beautiful
but
many
years
must
pass
before
you
try
to
read
them
for
shelley
poetry
is
more
vague
his
meaning
more
elusive
than
that
of
almost
any
other
poet
of
whom
we
have
spoken
it
is
rather
for
shelley
shorter
poems
his
lyrics
that
i
would
try
to
gain
your
love
at
present
for
although
he
wrote
the
cenci
the
best
tragedy
of
his
time
a
tragedy
which
by
its
terror
and
pain
links
him
with
shakespeare
it
is
as
a
lyric
poet
that
we
love
shelley
here
says
another
poet
shelley
forgets
that
he
is
anything
but
a
poet
forgets
sometimes
that
he
is
anything
but
a
child
he
plays
truant
from
earth
slips
through
the
wicket
of
fancy
into
heaven
meadow
and
goes
gathering
stars
and
of
all
our
poets
shelley
is
the
least
earthly
the
most
spiritual
but
he
loved
the
beautiful
world
the
sea
and
sky
and
when
we
have
heard
him
sing
of
the
clouds
and
the
skylark
of
the
wind
and
the
waves
of
thompson
the
fresh
earth
in
new
leaves
drest
and
the
starry
night
autumn
evening
and
the
morn
when
the
golden
mists
are
born
when
we
have
heard
him
sing
of
these
and
have
understood
with
our
heart
they
have
an
added
meaning
for
us
we
love
and
understand
the
song
of
the
skylark
better
for
having
heard
shelley
sing
of
it
hail
to
thee
blithe
spirit
bird
thou
never
wert
that
from
heaven
or
near
it
pourest
thy
full
heart
in
profuse
strains
of
unpremeditated
art
higher
still
and
higher
from
the
earth
thou
springest
like
a
cloud
of
fire
the
deep
blue
thou
wingest
and
singing
still
dost
soar
and
soaring
ever
singest
in
the
golden
lightening
of
the
sunken
sun
which
clouds
are
brightening
thou
dost
float
and
run
like
an
unbodied
joy
whose
race
is
just
begun
the
pale
purple
even
melts
around
thy
flight
like
a
star
of
heaven
in
the
broad
daylight
thou
art
unseen
but
yet
i
hear
thy
shrill
delight
all
the
earth
and
air
with
thy
voice
is
loud
as
when
night
is
bare
from
one
lonely
cloud
the
moon
rains
out
her
beams
and
heaven
is
overflowed
what
thou
art
we
know
not
what
is
most
like
thee
from
rainbow
clouds
there
flow
not
drops
so
bright
to
see
as
from
thy
presence
showers
a
rain
of
melody
like
a
poet
hidden
in
the
light
of
thought
singing
hymns
unbidden
till
the
world
is
wrought
in
sympathy
with
hopes
and
fears
it
heeded
not
like
a
maiden
in
a
palace
tower
soothing
her
soul
a
secret
hour
with
music
sweet
as
love
which
overflows
her
bower
teach
us
sprite
or
bird
what
sweet
thoughts
are
thine
i
have
never
heard
praise
of
love
or
wine
that
panted
forth
a
flood
of
rapture
so
divine
we
look
before
and
after
and
pine
for
what
is
not
our
sincerest
laughter
with
some
pain
is
fraught
the
sweetest
songs
are
those
that
tell
of
saddest
thought
yet
if
we
could
scorn
hate
and
pride
and
fear
if
we
were
things
born
not
to
shed
a
tear
i
know
not
how
thy
joy
we
ever
should
come
near
better
than
all
measures
of
delightful
sound
better
than
all
treasures
that
in
books
are
found
thy
skill
to
poet
were
thou
scorner
of
the
ground
teach
me
half
the
gladness
that
thy
brain
must
know
such
harmonious
madness
from
my
lips
would
flow
the
world
would
listen
then
as
i
am
listening
now
as
we
listen
to
the
lark
singing
we
look
upward
and
see
the
light
summer
clouds
driving
over
the
blue
sky
they
too
have
a
song
which
once
the
listening
poet
heard
i
bring
fresh
showers
for
the
thirsty
flowers
from
the
seas
and
the
streams
i
bear
light
shades
for
the
leaves
when
laid
in
their
noonday
dreams
from
my
wings
are
shaken
the
dews
that
waken
the
sweet
buds
every
one
when
rocked
to
rest
on
their
mother
breast
as
she
dances
about
the
sun
i
wield
the
flail
of
the
lashing
hail
and
whiten
the
green
plains
under
and
then
again
i
dissolve
it
in
rain
and
laugh
as
i
pass
in
thunder
i
sift
the
snow
on
the
mountains
below
and
their
great
pines
groan
aghast
and
all
the
night
is
my
pillow
white
while
asleep
in
the
arms
of
the
blast
sublime
on
the
towers
of
my
skiey
bowers
lightning
my
pilot
sits
in
a
cavern
under
is
fettered
the
thunder
it
struggles
and
howls
at
fits
over
earth
and
ocean
with
gentle
motion
this
pilot
is
guiding
me
lured
by
the
love
of
the
genii
that
move
in
the
depths
of
the
purple
sea
over
the
rills
and
the
crags
and
the
hills
over
the
lakes
and
the
plains
wherever
he
dream
under
mountain
or
stream
the
spirit
he
love
remains
and
i
all
the
while
bask
in
heaven
blue
smile
whilst
he
is
dissolving
in
rains
i
bind
the
sun
throne
with
the
burning
zone
and
the
moon
with
a
girdle
of
pearl
the
volcanoes
are
dim
and
the
starts
reel
and
swim
when
the
whirlwinds
my
banner
unfurl
from
cape
to
cape
with
a
shape
over
a
torrent
sea
i
hang
like
a
roof
the
mountains
its
columns
be
the
triumphal
arch
through
which
i
march
with
hurricane
fire
and
snow
when
the
powers
of
the
air
are
chained
to
my
chair
in
the
bow
the
above
its
soft
colours
wove
while
the
moist
earth
was
laughing
below
i
am
the
daughter
of
earth
and
water
and
the
nursling
of
the
sky
i
pass
through
the
pores
of
the
ocean
and
shores
i
change
but
i
can
not
die
for
after
the
rain
when
with
never
a
stain
the
pavilion
of
heaven
is
bare
and
the
winds
and
sunbeams
with
their
convex
gleams
build
up
the
blue
dome
of
air
i
silently
laugh
at
my
own
cenotaph
and
out
of
the
caverns
of
rain
like
a
child
from
the
womb
like
a
ghost
from
the
tomb
i
arise
and
unbuild
it
again
that
is
one
of
shelley
happiest
poems
for
most
of
his
poems
have
at
least
a
tone
of
sadness
even
the
joyous
song
of
the
skylark
leaves
us
with
a
sigh
on
our
lips
our
sincerest
laughter
with
some
pain
is
fraught
but
the
cloud
is
full
only
of
joy
and
movement
and
of
the
laughter
of
innocent
mischief
it
is
as
if
we
saw
the
boy
shelley
again
we
find
his
sadness
too
in
his
ode
to
the
west
wind
but
it
ends
on
a
note
of
hope
here
are
the
last
verses
make
me
thy
lyre
even
as
the
forest
is
what
if
my
leaves
are
falling
like
its
own
the
tumult
of
thy
mighty
harmonies
will
take
from
both
a
deep
autumnal
tone
sweet
though
in
sadness
be
thou
spirit
fierce
my
spirit
be
thou
me
impetuous
one
drive
my
dead
thoughts
over
the
universe
like
withered
leaves
to
quicken
a
new
birth
and
by
the
incantation
of
this
verse
scatter
as
from
an
unextinguished
hearth
ashes
and
sparks
my
words
among
mankind
be
through
my
lips
to
unawakened
earth
the
trumpet
of
a
prophecy
o
wind
if
winter
comes
can
spring
be
far
behind
shelley
sang
of
love
as
well
as
of
the
beauty
of
all
things
here
is
a
little
poem
some
lines
of
which
are
often
quoted
one
word
is
too
often
profaned
for
me
to
profane
it
one
feeling
too
falsely
disdained
for
thee
to
disdain
it
one
hope
is
too
like
despair
for
prudence
to
smother
and
pity
from
thee
more
dear
than
that
from
another
i
can
give
not
what
men
call
love
but
wilt
thou
accept
not
the
worship
the
heart
lifts
above
and
the
heavens
reject
not
the
desire
of
the
moth
for
the
star
of
the
night
for
the
morrow
the
devotion
of
something
afar
from
the
sphere
of
our
sorrow
and
when
his
heart
was
crushed
with
the
knowledge
of
the
wrong
and
cruelty
in
the
world
it
was
through
love
alone
that
he
saw
the
way
to
better
and
lovelier
things
to
purify
life
of
its
misery
and
evil
was
the
ruling
passion
of
his
soul
said
one
who
loved
him
and
knew
him
perhaps
better
than
any
living
being
and
it
was
through
love
and
the
beauty
of
love
that
he
hoped
for
the
triumph
of
human
weal
shelley
the
ideas
of
the
revolution
touched
him
as
they
had
touched
byron
and
wordsworth
and
although
wordsworth
turned
away
from
them
disappointed
shelley
held
on
hopefully
to
suffer
woes
which
hope
thinks
infinite
to
forgive
wrongs
darker
than
death
or
night
to
defy
power
which
seems
omnipotent
to
love
and
bear
to
hope
till
hope
creates
from
its
own
wreck
the
thing
it
contemplates
neither
to
change
nor
falter
nor
repent
this
like
thy
glory
titan
is
to
be
good
great
and
joyous
beautiful
and
free
this
is
alone
life
joy
empire
and
victory
unbound
one
of
shelley
last
poems
was
an
elegy
called
adonais
under
the
name
of
adonais
he
mourns
for
the
death
of
another
poet
john
keats
who
died
at
shelley
believed
when
he
wrote
the
poem
that
keats
had
been
done
to
death
by
the
cruel
criticisms
of
his
poems
that
he
had
died
of
a
broken
heart
because
the
world
neither
understood
nor
sympathized
with
his
poetry
shelley
himself
knew
what
it
was
to
suffer
from
unkind
criticisms
and
so
he
understood
the
feelings
of
another
poet
but
although
keats
did
suffer
something
from
neglect
and
cruelty
he
died
of
consumption
not
of
a
broken
heart
adonais
ranks
with
lycidas
as
one
of
the
most
beautiful
elegies
in
our
language
in
it
shelley
calls
upon
everything
upon
every
thought
and
feeling
upon
all
poets
to
weep
for
the
loss
of
adonais
all
he
had
loved
and
moulded
into
thought
from
shape
and
hue
and
odour
and
sweet
sound
lamented
adonais
morning
sought
her
eastern
and
her
hair
unbound
wet
with
the
tears
which
should
adorn
the
ground
dimmed
the
aerial
eyes
that
kindle
day
afar
the
melancholy
thunder
moaned
pale
ocean
in
unquiet
slumber
lay
and
the
wild
winds
flew
around
sobbing
in
their
dismay
the
mountain
shepherds
came
their
garlands
sere
their
magic
mantles
rent
the
pilgrims
of
eternity
whose
fame
over
his
living
head
like
heaven
is
bent
an
early
but
enduring
monument
came
veiling
all
the
lightnings
of
his
song
in
sorrow
from
her
wilds
sent
the
sweetest
lyrist
of
her
saddest
wrong
and
love
taught
grief
to
fall
like
music
from
his
tongue
byron
sends
thomas
moore
to
mourn
he
pictures
himself
too
among
the
mourners
others
of
less
note
came
one
frail
form
a
phantom
among
men
companionless
as
the
last
cloud
of
an
expiring
storm
whose
thunder
is
its
knell
shelley
mourned
for
keats
little
knowing
that
soon
others
would
mourn
for
himself
little
more
than
a
year
after
writing
this
poem
he
too
lay
dead
shelley
had
passed
much
of
his
time
on
the
continent
and
in
he
was
living
in
a
lonely
spot
on
the
shores
of
the
bay
of
spezia
he
always
loved
the
sea
and
he
here
spent
many
happy
hours
sailing
about
the
bay
in
his
boat
the
don
juan
hearing
that
a
friend
had
arrived
from
england
he
sailed
to
leghorn
to
welcome
him
shelley
met
his
friend
and
after
a
week
spent
with
him
and
with
lord
byron
he
set
out
for
home
the
little
boat
never
reached
its
port
for
on
the
journey
it
was
wrecked
we
shall
never
know
how
a
few
days
later
shelley
body
was
thrown
by
the
waves
upon
the
sandy
shore
in
his
pocket
was
found
a
copy
of
poems
doubled
back
as
if
he
had
been
reading
to
the
last
moment
and
hastily
thrust
the
book
into
his
pocket
the
body
was
cremated
upon
the
shore
and
the
ashes
were
buried
in
the
protestant
cemetery
at
rome
not
far
from
the
grave
of
keats
it
is
an
open
space
among
the
ruins
covered
in
winter
with
violets
and
daisies
it
might
make
one
in
love
with
death
to
think
that
one
should
be
buried
in
so
sweet
a
place
so
shelley
himself
had
written
in
the
preface
to
adonais
over
his
grave
was
placed
a
simple
stone
with
the
date
of
his
birth
and
death
and
the
words
cor
cordium
heart
of
hearts
beneath
these
words
are
some
lines
from
the
tempest
which
shelley
had
loved
nothing
of
him
doth
fade
but
doth
suffer
a
into
something
rich
and
strange
books
to
read
poems
of
shelley
selected
and
arranged
for
use
in
schools

chapter
lxxxi
keats
the
poet
of
beauty
john
keats
the
poet
whose
death
shelley
mourned
in
adonais
was
by
a
few
years
the
younger
having
been
born
in
he
was
born
too
in
very
different
circumstances
for
whereas
shelley
was
the
eldest
son
of
a
country
gentleman
john
keats
was
the
eldest
son
of
a
stableman
as
a
boy
thomas
keats
had
come
to
london
and
found
a
situation
as
ostler
in
some
livery
stable
he
was
clever
and
steady
and
before
he
was
twenty
had
risen
to
be
head
ostler
and
married
his
master
daughter
keats
then
became
manager
of
the
stables
and
his
who
was
comfortably
off
went
away
to
live
in
the
country
john
parents
were
not
poor
nor
were
they
common
people
in
all
they
had
four
children
two
boys
besides
john
and
a
little
girl
and
they
determined
to
give
their
children
a
good
education
they
would
have
liked
to
send
their
boys
to
harrow
but
finding
that
would
cost
too
much
they
sent
them
to
a
smaller
school
at
enfield
it
was
a
good
school
with
a
large
playground
and
john
seems
to
have
had
a
happy
time
there
he
was
a
little
chap
for
his
years
but
a
manly
little
fellow
broad
shouldered
and
strong
he
was
full
of
spirits
and
fond
of
fun
and
in
spite
of
his
passionate
temper
every
one
liked
him
he
was
not
particularly
fond
of
lessons
but
he
did
them
easily
and
then
turned
to
other
things
what
he
liked
best
was
fighting
he
would
fight
any
one
says
one
of
his
old
schoolfellows
morning
noon
and
night
his
brothers
among
the
rest
it
was
meat
and
drink
to
him
yet
says
another
no
one
ever
had
an
angry
word
to
say
of
him
and
they
loved
him
not
only
for
his
courage
but
for
his
generosity
his
mindedness
and
his
utter
ignorance
of
what
was
mean
or
base
but
although
john
was
so
much
loved
and
although
he
was
generally
so
bright
and
merry
he
had
miserable
times
too
he
had
fits
of
melancholy
but
when
these
came
he
would
go
to
his
brothers
and
pour
out
all
his
grief
to
them
this
made
him
feel
better
and
he
troubled
no
one
else
with
his
moods
holmes
very
soon
after
john
went
to
school
his
father
was
killed
by
a
fall
from
his
horse
his
grandfather
died
too
and
his
mother
married
again
but
the
marriage
was
not
happy
and
she
soon
left
her
new
husband
and
went
to
live
with
her
own
mother
at
edmonton
so
for
five
years
john
life
was
spent
between
school
and
his
grandmother
house
they
were
a
happy
family
the
brothers
loved
each
other
though
they
jangled
and
fought
and
they
loved
their
mother
and
little
sister
too
so
the
years
went
on
and
john
showed
not
the
lightest
sign
of
being
a
poet
some
doggerel
rimes
he
wrote
to
his
sister
show
the
boy
he
was
not
very
unlike
other
boys
there
was
a
naughty
boy
and
a
naughty
boy
was
he
he
kept
little
fishes
in
three
in
spite
of
the
might
of
the
maid
nor
afraid
of
his
granny
good
he
often
would
get
up
early
and
go
by
hook
or
crook
to
the
brook
and
bring
home
miller
thumb
tittlebat
not
over
fat
minnows
small
as
the
stall
of
a
glove
not
above
the
size
of
a
nice
little
little
fingers
after
john
had
been
at
school
some
time
he
suddenly
began
to
care
for
books
he
began
to
read
and
read
greedily
he
won
all
the
literature
prizes
and
even
on
he
could
hardly
be
driven
out
to
join
in
the
games
of
his
comrades
preferring
rather
to
sit
in
the
quiet
schoolroom
translating
from
latin
or
french
and
even
when
he
was
driven
forth
he
went
book
in
hand
it
was
while
john
was
still
at
school
that
his
mother
died
and
all
her
children
were
placed
under
the
care
of
a
guardian
as
john
was
now
fifteen
their
guardian
took
him
from
school
and
it
was
decided
to
make
him
a
doctor
he
was
apprenticed
in
the
fashion
of
the
day
to
a
surgeon
at
edmonton
for
five
years
keats
seems
to
have
been
quite
pleased
with
this
arrangement
his
new
studies
still
left
him
time
to
read
he
was
within
walking
distance
of
his
old
school
and
many
a
summer
afternoon
he
spent
reading
in
the
garden
with
cowden
clarke
the
son
of
his
old
schoolmaster
in
whom
keats
had
found
a
friend
from
this
friend
he
borrowed
spenser
faery
queen
and
having
read
it
a
new
seemed
opened
to
him
he
ramped
through
the
scenes
of
the
romance
like
a
young
horse
turned
into
a
spring
meadow
and
all
through
keats
poetry
we
find
the
love
of
beautiful
coloring
and
of
gorgeous
detail
that
we
also
find
in
spenser
it
was
spenser
that
awakened
in
keats
his
sleeping
gift
of
song
and
the
first
verses
which
he
wrote
were
in
imitation
of
the
elizabethan
poet
clarke
from
spenser
keats
learned
how
poetry
might
be
gemmed
how
it
might
glow
with
color
but
there
was
another
source
from
which
he
was
to
learn
what
pure
and
severe
beauty
might
mean
this
source
was
the
poetry
of
homer
keats
knew
nothing
of
greek
yet
all
his
poetry
shows
the
influence
of
greece
at
school
he
had
loved
the
greek
myths
and
had
read
them
in
english
now
among
the
books
he
read
with
his
friend
cowden
clarke
was
a
translation
of
homer
it
was
not
pope
translation
but
an
earlier
one
by
chapman
the
two
friends
began
to
read
it
one
evening
and
so
keen
was
keats
delight
that
at
times
he
shouted
aloud
in
joy
the
morning
light
put
out
their
candles
in
the
dawning
of
the
day
the
young
poet
went
home
quivering
with
delight
it
was
for
him
truly
the
dawning
of
a
new
day
for
him
still
another
new
world
had
opened
and
his
spirit
exulted
the
voice
of
this
great
master
poet
awoke
in
him
an
answering
voice
and
before
many
hours
had
passed
cowden
clarke
had
in
his
hands
sonnet
on
first
looking
into
chapman
homer
the
lines
that
spenser
had
called
forth
were
a
mere
imitation
homer
called
forth
keats
first
really
great
poem
much
have
i
travell
in
the
realms
of
gold
and
many
goodly
states
and
kingdoms
seen
round
many
western
islands
have
i
been
which
bards
in
fealty
to
apollo
hold
oft
of
one
wide
expanse
had
i
been
told
that
homer
ruled
as
his
demesne
yet
did
i
never
breathe
its
pure
serene
till
i
heard
chapman
speak
out
loud
and
bold
then
felt
i
like
some
watcher
of
the
skies
when
a
new
planet
swims
into
his
ken
or
like
stout
cortez
when
with
eagle
eyes
he
star
at
the
pacific
and
all
his
men
look
at
each
other
with
a
wild
surmise
silent
upon
a
peak
in
darien
for
some
unexplained
reason
keats
broke
his
apprenticeship
to
the
surgeon
at
edmonton
after
four
years
he
did
not
however
give
up
the
idea
of
becoming
a
doctor
and
he
went
on
with
his
studies
at
the
london
hospitals
keats
was
by
this
time
about
nineteen
he
was
small
only
about
five
feet
so
that
his
called
him
little
keats
but
his
face
was
fine
and
out
of
it
looked
eyes
like
those
of
a
wild
set
in
the
face
of
a
young
god
he
was
a
steady
student
although
he
did
scribble
doggerel
rhymes
among
his
notes
and
he
passed
his
examinations
well
yet
the
work
was
all
against
the
grain
more
and
more
he
began
to
feel
that
real
nothing
but
poetry
mattered
that
for
him
it
was
the
real
business
of
life
it
was
hard
to
study
when
even
a
sunbeam
had
power
to
set
his
thoughts
astray
there
came
a
sunbeam
into
the
room
once
he
said
to
a
friend
and
with
it
a
whole
troop
of
creatures
floating
in
the
ray
and
i
was
off
with
them
to
oberon
and
fairyland
keats
gradually
made
several
friends
among
the
young
writers
of
the
day
one
of
these
printed
a
few
of
the
young
poet
sonnets
in
his
paper
the
examiner
and
in
keats
published
a
volume
of
poems
this
was
his
to
medicine
for
although
very
little
notice
was
taken
of
the
book
and
very
few
copies
were
sold
keats
henceforth
took
poetry
for
his
life
work
the
life
of
keats
was
short
and
it
had
no
great
adventures
in
it
he
lived
much
now
with
his
two
brothers
until
the
elder
george
married
and
emigrated
to
america
and
the
younger
tom
who
had
always
been
an
invalid
died
he
went
on
excursions
too
with
his
friends
or
by
himself
to
country
or
seaside
places
or
sometimes
he
would
spend
days
and
nights
in
the
hospitable
homes
of
his
friends
and
all
the
time
he
wrote
letters
which
reveal
to
us
his
steadfast
true
self
and
poems
which
show
how
he
climbed
the
steps
of
fame
undismayed
at
the
ill
success
of
his
first
book
the
next
year
he
published
his
long
poem
endymion
endymion
was
a
fabled
grecian
youth
whose
beauty
was
so
great
that
selene
the
cold
moon
loved
him
he
fell
asleep
upon
the
hill
of
latmus
and
while
he
slept
selene
came
to
him
and
kissed
him
out
of
this
simple
story
keats
made
a
long
poem
of
four
books
or
parts
into
it
he
wove
many
other
stories
his
imagination
leading
him
through
strange
and
wondrous
scenery
the
poem
is
not
perfect
it
is
rambling
and
disconnected
the
story
of
endymion
being
but
the
finest
thread
to
hold
a
string
of
beads
and
priceless
pearls
together
the
first
book
is
merely
a
long
introduction
but
it
opens
with
unforgettable
lines
a
thing
of
beauty
is
a
joy
for
ever
its
loveliness
increases
it
will
never
pass
into
nothingness
but
still
will
keep
a
bower
quiet
for
us
and
a
sleep
full
of
sweet
dreams
and
health
and
quiet
breathing
then
the
poet
tells
us
what
are
the
things
of
beauty
of
which
he
thinks
such
the
sun
the
moon
trees
old
and
young
sprouting
a
shady
boon
for
simple
sheep
and
such
are
daffodils
with
the
green
world
they
live
in
and
clear
rills
that
for
themselves
a
cooling
covert
make
the
hot
season
the
mid
forest
brake
rich
with
a
sprinkling
of
fair
blooms
and
such
too
is
the
grandeur
of
the
dooms
we
have
imagined
for
the
mighty
dead
all
lovely
tales
that
we
have
heard
or
read
an
endless
fountain
of
immortal
drink
pouring
unto
us
from
the
heaven
brink
but
although
throughout
the
long
poem
there
are
lovely
passages
and
one
or
two
most
beautiful
lyrics
the
critics
of
the
day
saw
only
the
faults
of
which
endymion
is
full
and
the
poem
was
received
with
a
storm
of
abuse
soon
after
keats
published
this
poem
he
with
a
friend
set
out
on
a
walking
tour
to
the
lake
country
and
to
scotland
this
was
keats
first
sight
of
real
mountains
and
he
gloried
in
the
grand
scenery
but
said
human
nature
is
finer
when
keats
set
out
there
was
not
a
sign
of
the
invalid
about
him
he
walked
twenty
or
thirty
miles
a
day
and
cheerfully
bore
the
discomforts
of
travel
but
the
tour
proved
too
much
for
his
strength
he
caught
a
bad
cold
and
sore
throat
and
was
ordered
home
by
the
doctor
he
went
by
boat
arriving
brown
shabby
and
almost
shoeless
among
his
london
friends
keats
never
quite
recovered
his
good
health
and
other
griefs
and
troubles
crowded
in
upon
him
it
was
after
his
return
from
this
tour
that
his
dearly
loved
brother
tom
died
cruel
criticisms
of
his
poetry
hurt
him
at
the
same
time
and
he
was
in
trouble
about
money
for
the
family
guardian
had
not
proved
a
good
manager
and
now
to
this
already
overcharged
heart
something
else
was
added
keats
fell
in
love
the
lady
he
loved
was
young
and
beautiful
but
commonplace
keats
himself
describes
her
when
he
first
met
her
as
beautiful
and
elegant
graceful
silly
fashionable
and
strange
her
beauty
and
strangeness
won
for
her
a
way
to
the
poet
heart
love
however
brought
to
him
no
joyful
rest
but
rather
passionate
jealous
restlessness
yet
in
spite
of
all
his
troubles
keats
continued
to
write
poems
which
will
ever
be
remembered
as
among
the
most
beautiful
in
our
language
like
scott
and
byron
keats
wrote
metrical
romances
one
of
these
isabella
or
the
pot
of
basil
is
founded
upon
a
tale
of
boccaccio
that
old
master
to
whom
so
many
poets
have
gone
for
inspiration
in
keats
romances
there
is
no
no
clash
of
swords
as
in
scott
and
the
luxury
is
altogether
different
from
byron
there
is
in
them
that
trembling
sense
of
beauty
which
opens
to
us
wide
windows
into
fairyland
they
are
simple
stories
veiled
in
the
glamour
of
lovely
words
and
full
of
the
rich
color
and
the
magic
of
the
middle
ages
but
here
as
elsewhere
in
keats
poetry
what
we
lack
is
the
touch
of
human
sorrow
keats
wrote
of
nature
with
all
wordsworth
insight
and
truth
and
with
greater
magic
of
words
he
understood
the
mystery
of
nature
but
of
the
mystery
of
the
heart
of
man
it
was
not
his
to
sing
he
lived
in
a
world
apart
the
terror
and
beauty
of
real
life
hardly
touched
him
alone
of
all
the
poets
of
his
day
he
was
unmoved
by
the
french
revolution
and
all
that
it
stood
for
some
day
you
will
read
keats
metrical
romances
and
now
i
will
give
you
a
few
verses
from
some
of
his
odes
for
in
his
odes
we
have
keats
poetry
at
its
very
best
here
are
some
verses
from
his
ode
on
a
grecian
urn
you
have
seen
such
a
vase
perhaps
with
beautiful
sculptured
figures
on
it
dancing
maidens
and
piping
shepherds
heard
melodies
are
sweet
but
those
unheard
are
sweeter
therefore
ye
soft
pipes
play
on
not
to
the
sensual
ear
but
more
endear
pipe
to
the
spirit
ditties
of
no
tone
fair
youth
beneath
the
trees
thou
canst
not
leave
thy
song
nor
ever
can
those
trees
be
bare
bold
lover
never
never
canst
thou
kiss
though
winning
near
the
goal
yet
do
not
grieve
she
can
not
fade
though
thou
hast
not
thy
bliss
for
ever
wilt
thou
love
and
she
be
fair
ah
happy
happy
bought
that
can
not
shed
your
leaves
nor
ever
bid
the
spring
adieu
and
happy
melodist
unwearied
for
ever
piping
songs
for
ever
new
more
happy
love
more
happy
happy
love
for
ever
warm
and
still
to
be
enjoy
for
ever
panting
and
for
ever
young
all
breathing
human
passion
far
above
that
leaves
a
heart
and
cloy
a
burning
forehead
and
a
parching
tongue
o
attic
shape
fair
attitude
with
of
marble
men
and
maidens
with
forest
branches
and
the
trodden
weed
thou
silent
form
dost
tease
us
out
of
thought
as
doth
eternity
cold
pastoral
when
old
age
shall
this
generation
waste
thou
shalt
remain
in
midst
of
other
woe
than
ours
a
friend
to
man
to
whom
thou
is
truth
truth
beauty
that
is
all
ye
know
on
earth
and
all
ye
need
to
know
in
these
last
lines
we
have
the
dominant
note
in
keats
song
beauty
and
the
love
of
beauty
what
is
true
must
be
beautiful
and
just
in
so
far
as
we
move
away
from
truth
we
lose
what
is
beautiful
nothing
is
so
ugly
as
a
lie
and
now
remembering
how
shelley
sang
of
the
skylark
you
will
like
to
read
how
his
brother
poet
sang
of
the
nightingale
my
heart
aches
and
a
drowsy
numbness
pains
my
sense
as
though
of
hemlock
i
had
drunk
or
emptied
some
dull
opiate
to
the
drains
one
minute
past
and
had
sunk
is
not
through
envy
of
thy
happy
lot
but
being
too
happy
in
thine
happiness
that
thou
dryad
of
the
trees
in
some
melodious
plot
of
beechen
green
and
shadows
numberless
singest
of
summer
in
ease
darkling
i
listen
and
for
many
a
time
i
have
been
half
in
love
with
easeful
death
call
him
soft
names
in
many
a
mused
rhyme
to
take
into
the
air
my
quiet
breath
now
more
than
ever
seems
it
rich
to
die
to
cease
upon
the
midnight
with
no
pain
while
thou
art
pouring
forth
thy
soul
abroad
in
such
an
ecstasy
still
wouldst
thou
sing
and
i
have
ears
in
vain
to
thy
high
requiem
become
a
sod
thou
wast
not
born
for
death
immortal
bird
no
hungry
generations
tread
thee
down
the
voice
i
hear
this
passing
night
was
heard
in
ancient
days
by
emperor
and
clown
perhaps
the
selfsame
song
that
found
a
path
through
the
sad
heart
of
ruth
when
sick
for
home
she
stood
in
tears
amid
the
alien
corn
the
same
that
oft
times
hath
charm
magic
casements
opening
on
the
foam
of
perilous
seas
in
faery
lands
forlorn
forlorn
the
very
word
is
like
a
bell
to
toll
me
back
from
thee
to
my
sole
self
adieu
the
fancy
can
not
cheat
so
well
as
she
is
famed
to
do
deceiving
elf
adieu
adieu
thy
plaintive
anthem
fades
past
the
near
meadows
over
the
still
stream
up
the
and
now
is
buried
deep
in
the
next
valley
glades
was
it
a
vision
or
a
waking
dream
fled
is
the
music
do
i
wake
or
sleep
as
another
has
said
speaking
of
keats
odes
greater
lyrical
poetry
the
world
may
have
seen
than
any
that
is
in
these
lovelier
it
surely
has
never
seen
nor
ever
can
it
possibly
see
hyperion
which
also
ranks
among
keats
great
poems
is
an
unfinished
epic
in
a
way
the
subject
of
the
poem
reminds
us
of
paradise
lost
for
here
keats
sings
of
the
overthrow
of
the
titans
or
earlier
greek
gods
by
the
olympians
or
later
greek
gods
and
in
the
majestic
flow
of
the
blank
verse
we
sometimes
seem
to
hear
an
echo
of
milton
hyperion
who
gives
his
name
to
the
poem
was
the
who
was
dethroned
by
apollo
when
the
poem
opens
we
see
the
old
god
saturn
already
fallen
old
saturn
lifted
up
his
faded
eyes
and
saw
his
kingdom
gone
and
all
the
gloom
and
sorrow
of
the
place
and
that
fair
kneeling
goddess
and
then
spake
as
with
a
palsied
tongue
and
while
his
beard
shook
horrid
with
such
tender
spouse
of
gold
hyperion
thea
i
feel
thee
ere
i
see
thy
face
look
up
and
let
me
see
our
doom
in
it
look
up
and
tell
me
if
this
feeble
shape
is
saturn
if
thou
the
voice
of
saturn
tell
me
if
this
wrinkled
brow
naked
and
bare
of
its
great
diadem
peers
like
the
front
of
saturn
who
had
power
to
make
me
desolate
whence
came
the
strength
how
was
it
nurtur
to
such
bursting
forth
while
fate
seem
strangled
in
my
nervous
grasp
but
it
is
so
saturn
is
king
no
more
fate
willed
it
so
but
suddenly
he
rises
and
in
helpless
passion
cries
out
against
fate
saturn
must
be
king
yes
there
must
be
a
golden
victory
there
must
be
gods
thrown
down
and
trumpets
blown
of
triumph
calm
and
hymns
of
festival
upon
the
gold
clouds
metropolitan
voices
of
soft
proclaim
and
silver
stir
of
strings
in
hollow
shells
and
there
shall
be
beautiful
things
made
new
for
the
surprise
of
the
i
will
give
command
thea
thea
thea
where
is
saturn
the
volume
containing
these
and
other
poems
was
published
in
little
more
than
three
years
after
keats
first
volume
and
never
perhaps
has
poet
made
such
strides
in
so
short
a
time
and
this
last
book
was
kindly
received
success
had
come
to
keats
but
young
though
he
still
was
the
success
was
too
late
for
soon
it
was
seen
that
his
health
had
gone
and
that
his
life
work
was
done
as
a
last
hope
his
friends
advised
him
to
spend
the
winter
in
italy
so
with
a
friend
he
set
out
he
never
returned
but
died
in
rome
in
the
arms
of
his
friend
on
the
february
he
was
only
before
he
died
he
asked
that
on
his
grave
should
be
placed
the
words
here
lies
one
whose
name
was
writ
in
water
he
had
his
wish
but
we
to
whom
he
left
his
poetry
know
that
his
name
is
written
in
the
stars
how
shelley
mourned
for
him
you
have
read
how
the
friends
who
knew
and
loved
him
mourned
we
learn
from
what
they
say
of
him
i
can
not
afford
to
lose
him
wrote
one
if
i
know
what
it
is
to
love
i
truly
love
john
keats
another
says
he
was
the
most
unselfish
of
human
creatures
and
still
another
a
sweeter
tempered
man
i
never
knew
in
a
letter
which
reached
rome
too
late
was
this
message
for
keats
tell
that
great
poet
and
man
that
we
shall
all
bear
his
memory
in
the
most
precious
parts
of
our
hearts
and
that
the
world
shall
bow
their
heads
to
it
as
our
loves
do
we
bow
our
heads
to
his
memory
and
say
farewell
to
him
in
these
words
of
his
own
fairy

chapter
lxxxii
carlyle
the
sage
of
chelsea
john
keats
was
little
more
than
a
month
old
when
far
away
across
the
border
another
little
baby
boy
was
born
his
parent
too
were
simple
folk
and
he
too
was
born
to
be
great
this
boy
name
was
thomas
carlyle
his
father
was
a
and
had
built
with
his
own
hands
the
house
in
which
his
son
thomas
was
born
the
little
village
of
ecclefechan
was
about
six
miles
from
the
solway
firth
among
the
pasture
lands
of
the
bale
of
annan
here
thomas
grew
to
be
a
boy
running
about
barefooted
and
sturdy
with
his
many
brothers
and
sisters
and
one
brother
older
than
himself
but
he
did
not
run
about
quite
wild
for
by
the
time
he
was
five
his
mother
had
taught
him
to
read
and
his
father
had
taught
him
to
do
sums
and
then
he
was
sent
to
the
village
school
james
carlyle
was
a
good
and
steady
workman
long
afterwards
his
famous
son
said
of
him
nothing
that
he
undertook
to
do
but
he
did
it
faithfully
and
like
a
true
man
i
shall
look
on
the
houses
he
built
with
a
certain
proud
interest
they
stand
firm
and
sound
to
the
heart
all
over
his
little
district
no
one
that
comes
after
him
will
ever
say
was
the
finger
of
a
hollow
they
are
little
texts
to
me
of
the
gospel
of
free
will
but
there
were
meanwhile
many
little
folks
to
clothe
many
hungry
little
mouths
to
fill
so
their
clothes
were
of
the
plainest
and
porridge
and
milk
and
potatoes
forming
their
only
fare
it
was
not
a
joyful
life
says
thomas
what
life
is
yet
a
safe
quiet
one
above
most
others
or
any
others
i
have
witnessed
a
wholesome
one
between
the
earnest
and
frugal
father
and
mother
and
their
children
there
was
a
great
and
reverent
though
quiet
love
and
poor
though
they
were
the
parents
determined
that
their
children
should
be
well
taught
so
when
thomas
was
ten
he
was
sent
to
a
school
at
annan
some
five
miles
away
where
he
could
learn
more
than
in
the
little
village
school
on
a
bright
may
morning
thomas
set
out
trotting
gayly
by
his
father
side
this
was
his
first
venture
into
the
world
and
his
heart
was
full
of
hopes
just
dashed
with
sadness
at
leaving
his
mother
but
the
wonderful
new
world
of
school
proved
a
bitter
disappointment
to
the
little
fellow
he
had
a
violent
temper
and
his
mother
fearing
into
what
he
might
be
led
when
far
from
her
made
him
promise
never
to
return
a
blow
thomas
kept
his
promise
with
the
result
that
his
fellows
finding
they
might
torment
him
with
safety
tormented
him
without
mercy
in
a
book
called
sartor
resartus
which
carlyle
wrote
later
and
which
here
and
there
was
called
forth
by
a
memory
of
his
own
life
he
says
my
schoolfellows
were
boys
most
rude
boys
and
obeyed
the
impulse
of
rude
nature
which
bids
the
deer
herd
fall
upon
any
stricken
hart
the
duck
flock
put
to
death
any
brother
or
sister
and
on
all
hands
the
strong
tyrannise
over
the
weak
so
thomas
at
school
was
unhappy
and
lonely
and
tormented
but
one
day
unable
to
bear
the
torment
longer
he
flew
at
one
of
the
biggest
bullies
in
the
school
the
result
was
a
fight
in
which
thomas
got
the
worst
but
he
had
shown
his
fellows
what
he
could
do
he
was
tormented
no
longer
yet
ever
afterwards
he
bore
an
unhappy
remembrance
of
those
days
at
school
after
three
years
his
came
to
an
end
he
was
not
yet
fourteen
but
he
had
proved
himself
so
eager
a
scholar
that
his
father
decided
to
send
him
to
college
and
let
him
become
a
minister
so
early
one
november
morning
he
set
out
in
the
cold
and
dark
upon
his
long
tramp
of
more
than
eighty
miles
to
edinburgh
it
was
dark
when
he
left
the
house
and
his
father
and
mother
went
with
him
a
little
way
and
then
they
turned
back
and
left
tom
to
trudge
along
in
the
growing
light
with
another
boy
a
year
or
two
older
who
was
returning
to
college
little
is
known
of
carlyle
college
days
after
five
study
at
nineteen
he
became
a
schoolmaster
still
with
the
intention
of
later
becoming
a
minister
as
his
father
wished
but
for
teaching
carlyle
had
no
love
and
after
some
years
of
it
first
in
schools
and
then
as
a
private
tutor
he
gave
it
up
he
gave
up
too
the
idea
of
becoming
a
minister
for
he
found
he
had
lost
the
simple
faith
of
his
fathers
and
could
not
with
good
conscience
teach
to
others
what
he
did
not
thoroughly
believe
himself
he
gave
up
too
the
thought
of
becoming
a
barrister
for
after
a
little
study
he
found
he
had
no
bent
for
law
already
he
had
begun
to
write
besides
other
things
he
had
translated
and
published
wilhelm
meister
a
story
by
the
great
german
poet
goethe
it
was
well
received
the
great
goethe
himself
wrote
a
kind
letter
to
his
translator
it
came
to
him
said
carlyle
like
a
message
from
fairyland
and
thus
encouraged
after
drifting
here
and
there
trying
first
one
thing
and
then
another
carlyle
gave
himself
up
to
literature
meanwhile
he
had
met
and
loved
a
beautiful
and
clever
lady
named
jane
walsh
she
was
above
him
in
station
witty
and
sought
after
admiring
the
genius
of
carlyle
she
yet
had
no
mind
she
said
to
marry
a
poor
genius
but
she
did
and
so
began
a
long
mistake
of
forty
years
the
newly
married
couple
took
a
cottage
on
the
outskirts
of
edinburgh
and
there
carlyle
settled
down
to
his
writing
but
money
coming
in
slowly
carlyle
found
he
could
no
longer
afford
to
live
in
edinburgh
so
after
a
year
and
a
half
of
cheerful
social
life
surrounded
by
many
cultured
friends
he
and
his
wife
moved
to
craigenputtock
a
lonely
house
fourteen
miles
from
dumfries
which
belonged
to
carlyle
here
was
solitude
indeed
the
air
was
so
quiet
that
the
very
sheep
could
be
heard
nibbling
for
miles
around
there
was
no
house
the
post
came
only
once
a
week
and
months
at
a
time
would
go
past
without
a
visitor
crossing
the
doorstep
to
carlyle
who
hated
noises
who
all
his
life
long
waged
war
against
howling
dogs
and
demon
fowls
the
silence
and
loneliness
were
delightful
his
work
took
all
his
thoughts
filled
all
his
life
he
did
not
remember
that
what
to
him
was
simply
peaceful
quiet
was
for
his
witty
social
wife
a
dreary
desert
of
loneliness
carlyle
was
not
only
as
his
mother
said
gey
ill
to
deal
wi
but
also
gey
ill
to
live
wi
for
he
was
a
genius
and
a
sick
genius
he
was
nervous
and
bilious
and
suffered
tortures
from
indigestion
which
made
him
often
gloomy
and
miserable
it
was
not
a
happy
fortune
which
cast
jane
and
thomas
carlyle
together
into
this
loneliness
still
the
days
passed
not
all
in
gloom
thomas
writing
a
wonderful
book
sartor
resartus
and
jane
using
all
her
cleverness
to
make
the
home
beautiful
and
comfortable
for
they
were
very
poor
and
jane
who
before
her
marriage
had
no
knowledge
of
housekeeping
found
herself
obliged
to
cook
and
do
much
of
the
housework
herself
nearly
all
carlyle
first
books
had
to
do
with
german
literature
he
translated
stories
from
great
german
writers
and
wrote
about
the
authors
and
just
as
byron
had
taught
people
on
the
continent
to
read
english
literature
so
carlyle
taught
english
people
to
read
german
literature
he
steeped
himself
so
thoroughly
in
german
that
he
himself
came
to
write
english
if
i
may
so
express
it
with
a
german
accent
carlyle
style
is
harsh
and
rugged
it
has
a
vividness
and
picturesqueness
all
his
own
but
when
carlyle
began
to
write
people
cared
neither
for
his
style
nor
for
his
subjects
he
found
publishers
hard
to
persuade
and
life
was
by
no
means
easy
when
sartor
was
finished
carlyle
took
it
to
london
but
could
find
no
one
willing
to
publish
it
so
it
was
cut
up
into
articles
and
published
in
a
magazine
and
was
then
mostly
laughed
at
says
carlyle
and
many
declared
they
would
stop
taking
the
magazine
unless
these
ridiculous
papers
ceased
not
until
years
had
passed
was
it
published
in
book
form
i
do
not
think
i
can
make
you
understand
the
charm
of
sartor
it
is
a
prose
poem
and
a
book
you
must
leave
for
the
years
to
come
sartor
resartus
means
the
tailor
patched
again
and
under
the
guise
of
a
philosophy
of
clothes
carlyle
teaches
that
man
and
everything
belonging
to
him
is
only
the
expression
of
the
one
great
real
thing
god
thus
in
this
one
pregnant
subject
of
clothes
rightly
understood
is
included
all
that
men
have
thought
dreamed
done
and
been
the
book
is
full
of
humor
and
wisdom
of
stray
lightenings
and
deep
growlings
there
are
glimpses
of
a
story
to
be
caught
to
it
is
perhaps
the
most
carlylean
book
carlyle
ever
wrote
but
let
it
lie
yet
awhile
on
your
bookshelf
unread
at
the
end
of
six
years
or
so
carlyle
decided
that
craigenputtock
was
of
no
use
to
him
he
wanted
to
get
the
ear
of
the
world
to
make
the
world
listen
to
him
it
would
not
listen
to
him
when
he
spoke
from
a
wilderness
so
he
made
the
great
plunge
and
saying
to
the
quiet
of
barren
rock
and
moorland
he
came
to
live
in
london
he
took
a
house
in
cheyne
row
in
chelsea
and
this
for
the
rest
of
his
life
was
his
home
but
at
first
london
was
hardly
less
lonely
than
craigenputtock
it
seemed
impossible
to
make
people
want
either
carlyle
or
his
books
he
had
created
no
of
his
own
says
a
friend
who
wrote
his
life
the
public
which
existed
could
not
understand
his
writings
and
would
not
buy
them
nor
could
he
be
induced
so
much
as
to
attempt
to
please
it
and
thus
it
was
that
in
cheyne
row
he
was
more
neglected
than
he
had
been
in
scotland
still
in
spite
of
neglect
carlyle
worked
on
now
writing
his
great
french
revolution
he
labored
for
months
at
this
book
and
at
length
having
finished
the
first
volume
of
it
he
lent
it
to
a
friend
to
read
this
friend
left
it
lying
about
and
a
servant
thinking
it
waste
paper
destroyed
it
in
great
distress
he
came
to
tell
carlyle
what
had
happened
it
was
a
terrible
blow
for
carlyle
had
earned
nothing
for
months
and
money
was
growing
scarce
but
he
bravely
hid
his
consternation
and
comforted
his
friend
we
must
try
to
hide
from
him
how
very
serious
this
business
is
to
us
were
the
first
words
he
said
to
his
wife
when
they
were
alone
together
long
afterwards
when
asked
how
he
felt
when
he
heard
the
news
well
i
just
felt
like
a
man
swimming
without
water
he
replied
of
tennyson
so
once
more
he
set
to
work
rewriting
all
that
had
been
lost
in
the
book
was
published
and
from
that
time
carlyle
took
his
place
in
the
world
as
a
man
of
genius
but
money
was
still
scarce
so
as
a
means
of
making
some
he
gave
several
courses
of
lectures
but
he
hated
it
o
heaven
he
cries
i
can
not
speak
i
can
only
gasp
and
write
and
stutter
a
spectacle
to
gods
and
fashionables
being
forced
to
it
by
want
of
money
one
course
of
these
lectures
the
last
was
on
heroes
and
her
worship
this
may
be
one
of
the
first
of
carlyle
book
that
you
will
care
to
read
and
you
may
now
like
to
hear
what
he
has
to
say
of
samuel
johnson
in
the
hero
as
a
man
of
letters
as
for
johnson
i
have
always
considered
him
to
be
by
nature
one
of
our
great
english
souls
a
strong
and
noble
man
so
much
left
undeveloped
in
him
to
the
last
in
a
kindlier
element
what
might
he
not
have
been
poet
priest
sovereign
ruler
on
the
whole
a
man
must
not
complain
of
his
or
his
or
the
like
it
is
thriftless
work
doing
so
his
time
is
bad
well
then
he
is
there
to
make
it
better
johnson
youth
was
poor
isolated
hopeless
very
miserable
indeed
it
does
not
seem
possible
that
in
any
of
the
favourablest
outward
circumstances
johnson
life
could
have
been
other
than
a
painful
one
the
world
might
have
had
more
profitable
work
out
of
him
or
less
but
his
effort
against
the
world
work
could
never
have
been
a
light
one
nature
in
return
for
his
nobleness
had
said
to
him
in
an
element
of
diseased
sorrow
nay
perhaps
the
sorrow
and
the
nobleness
were
intimately
and
even
inseparably
connected
with
each
other
the
largest
soul
that
was
in
all
england
and
provision
made
for
it
of
halfpenny
a
day
yet
a
giant
invincible
soul
a
true
man
one
remembers
always
that
story
of
the
shoes
at
oxford
the
rough
college
servitor
stalking
about
in
winter
season
with
his
shoes
worn
out
how
the
charitable
gentleman
commoner
secretly
places
a
new
pair
at
his
door
and
the
servitor
lifting
them
looking
at
them
near
with
his
dim
eyes
with
what
thought
pitches
them
out
of
window
wet
feet
mud
frost
hunger
or
what
you
will
but
not
beggary
we
can
not
stand
beggary
rude
stubborn
help
here
a
whole
world
of
squalor
rudeness
confused
misery
and
want
yet
of
nobleness
and
manfulness
withal
it
is
a
type
of
the
man
life
this
pitching
away
of
the
shoes
an
original
man
not
a
second
hand
borrowing
or
begging
man
let
us
stand
on
our
own
basis
at
any
rate
on
such
shoes
as
we
ourselves
can
get
on
frost
and
mud
if
you
will
but
honestly
on
that
on
the
reality
and
substance
which
nature
gives
us
not
on
the
semblance
on
the
thing
she
has
give
another
than
us
and
yet
with
all
this
rugged
pride
of
manhood
and
was
there
ever
soul
more
tenderly
affectionate
loyally
submissive
to
what
was
really
higher
than
he
great
souls
are
always
loyally
submissive
reverent
to
what
is
over
them
only
small
souls
are
otherwise
it
was
in
virtue
of
his
sincerity
of
his
speaking
still
in
some
sort
from
the
heart
of
nature
though
in
the
current
artificial
dialect
that
johnson
was
a
prophet
mark
too
how
little
johnson
boasts
of
his
he
has
no
suspicion
of
his
being
particularly
sincere
of
his
being
particularly
anything
a
man
or
as
he
calls
himself
trying
hard
to
get
some
honest
livelihood
in
the
world
not
to
starve
but
to
live
without
stealing
a
noble
unconsciousness
is
in
him
he
does
not
truth
on
his
no
but
he
stands
by
truth
speaks
by
it
works
and
lives
by
it
thus
it
ever
is
johnson
was
a
prophet
to
his
people
preached
a
gospel
to
them
as
all
like
him
always
do
the
highest
gospel
he
preached
we
may
describe
as
a
kind
of
moral
prudence
a
world
where
much
is
to
be
done
and
little
is
to
be
known
see
how
you
will
do
it
a
thing
well
worth
preaching
world
where
much
is
to
be
done
and
little
is
to
be
known
do
not
sink
yourselves
in
boundless
bottomless
abysses
of
doubt
such
gospel
johnson
preached
and
taught
coupled
with
this
other
great
gospel
your
mind
of
cant
have
no
trade
with
cant
stand
on
the
cold
mud
in
the
frosty
weather
but
let
it
be
in
your
own
real
torn
shoes
will
be
better
for
you
as
mahomet
says
i
call
this
i
call
these
two
things
joined
together
a
great
gospel
the
greatest
perhaps
that
was
possible
at
that
time
i
give
this
quotation
from
heroes
because
there
is
in
some
ways
a
great
likeness
between
johnson
and
carlyle
both
were
sincere
and
both
after
a
time
of
poverty
and
struggle
ruled
the
thought
of
their
day
for
carlyle
became
known
by
degrees
and
became
like
johnson
before
him
a
great
literary
man
he
was
sought
after
by
the
other
writers
of
his
day
who
came
to
listen
to
the
growlings
of
the
sage
of
chelsea
carlyle
like
johnson
was
a
prophet
with
a
message
carlyle
says
a
french
writer
has
taken
up
a
mission
he
is
a
prophet
the
prophet
of
sincerity
this
sincerity
or
earnestness
he
would
have
applied
everywhere
he
makes
it
the
law
the
healthy
and
holy
law
of
art
of
morals
of
politics
and
through
all
carlyle
exaggeration
and
waywardness
of
diction
we
find
that
note
ring
clear
again
and
again
be
sincere
find
the
highest
and
worship
it
with
all
thy
mind
and
heart
and
will
and
although
for
us
of
the
light
of
carlyle
as
a
prophet
may
be
somewhat
dimmed
we
may
still
find
as
a
great
man
of
his
own
day
found
that
the
good
his
writings
do
us
is
not
as
philosophy
to
instruct
but
as
poetry
to
animate
mill
carlyle
went
steadily
on
with
his
writing
in
the
summer
he
would
have
his
table
and
tray
of
books
brought
out
into
the
garden
so
that
he
could
write
in
the
open
air
but
much
of
his
work
too
was
done
in
a
sound
proof
room
which
he
built
at
the
top
of
the
house
in
order
to
escape
from
the
horror
of
noise
the
room
was
not
however
a
great
success
for
though
it
kept
out
some
noises
it
let
in
others
even
worse
when
visitors
came
they
were
received
either
indoors
or
in
the
little
garden
which
carlyle
found
of
admirable
comfort
in
the
smoking
way
in
the
garden
they
smoked
and
talked
sitting
on
kitchen
chairs
or
on
the
quaint
china
barrels
which
carlyle
named
noblemen
seats
among
the
many
friends
carlyle
made
was
the
young
poet
alfred
tennyson
returning
from
a
walk
one
day
he
found
a
splendidly
handsome
young
man
sitting
in
the
garden
talking
to
his
wife
it
was
the
poet
here
is
how
carlyle
describes
his
new
friend
a
fine
featured
man
is
alfred
dusty
smoky
free
and
easy
who
swims
outwardly
and
inwardly
with
great
composure
in
an
articulate
element
as
of
tranquil
chaos
and
tobacco
smoke
great
now
and
then
when
he
does
emerge
a
most
restful
brotherly
man
or
again
smokes
infinite
tobacco
his
voice
is
musical
metallic
fit
for
loud
laughter
and
piercing
wail
and
all
that
may
lie
between
i
do
not
meet
in
these
late
decades
such
company
over
a
pipe
we
shall
see
what
he
will
grow
to
lord
tennyson
life
of
tennyson
although
carlyle
was
older
than
tennyson
by
fourteen
years
this
was
the
beginning
of
a
friendship
which
strengthened
with
years
and
lasted
when
they
were
both
men
they
talked
and
smoked
and
walked
about
together
often
at
night
through
the
lit
streets
sometimes
in
the
wind
and
rain
carlyle
crying
out
as
they
walked
along
against
the
dirt
and
squalor
and
noise
of
london
that
healthless
profitless
mad
and
place
that
devil
oven
the
years
passed
and
carlyle
added
book
to
book
perhaps
of
them
all
that
which
we
should
be
most
grateful
for
is
his
life
and
letters
of
cromwell
for
in
this
book
he
set
cromwell
in
a
new
light
a
better
light
than
he
had
ever
been
set
before
carlyle
is
a
hero
worshiper
and
in
cromwell
as
a
hero
he
can
find
no
fault
he
had
of
course
his
faults
like
other
men
and
he
had
no
need
of
such
blind
championship
for
in
his
letters
and
speeches
gathered
together
and
given
to
the
world
by
carlyle
he
speaks
for
himself
in
them
we
find
one
to
whom
we
may
look
up
as
a
true
hero
a
man
of
strength
to
trust
we
find
too
a
man
of
such
broad
kindliness
a
man
of
such
a
tender
human
heart
that
we
may
love
him
another
great
book
was
carlyle
history
of
frederick
the
great
it
is
a
marvelous
piece
of
historical
work
and
as
volume
after
volume
appeared
carlyle
fame
steadily
rose
no
critic
says
his
first
biographer
froude
no
critic
after
the
completion
of
frederick
challenged
carlyle
right
to
a
place
beside
the
greatest
of
english
authors
past
and
present
he
was
a
great
historian
but
in
the
history
he
gives
us
not
dead
facts
but
living
breathing
men
and
women
his
pages
are
as
full
of
color
and
of
life
as
the
pages
of
shakespeare
the
old
days
of
struggle
and
want
were
long
over
but
the
carlyles
still
lived
the
simple
life
in
the
little
chelsea
house
as
another
has
quaintly
put
it
tom
carlyle
lives
in
perfect
dignity
in
a
little
pound
house
in
chelsea
with
a
snuffy
scotch
maid
to
open
the
door
and
the
best
company
in
england
ringing
at
it
then
in
carlyle
was
chosen
lord
rector
of
edinburgh
university
and
although
this
could
add
little
to
his
fame
he
was
glad
that
his
own
country
had
recognized
his
greatness
fifty
years
before
he
had
left
the
university
a
poor
and
unknown
lad
now
at
a
famous
man
he
returned
to
make
his
speech
upon
entering
his
office
as
rector
this
speech
was
a
splendid
success
his
reception
magnificent
a
perfect
triumph
as
a
friend
telegraphed
to
carlyle
waiting
anxiously
for
news
in
london
for
a
few
days
carlyle
lingered
in
scotland
then
he
was
suddenly
recalled
home
by
the
terrible
news
that
his
wife
had
died
suddenly
while
out
driving
it
was
a
crushing
blow
only
when
it
was
too
late
did
carlyle
realize
all
that
his
wife
had
been
to
him
she
was
as
he
wrote
on
her
tombstone
suddenly
snatched
away
from
him
and
the
light
of
his
life
as
if
gone
out
the
light
indeed
had
gone
out
the
rest
of
his
life
was
a
sad
twilight
filled
with
cruel
remorse
he
still
wrote
a
little
and
friends
were
kind
but
his
real
work
in
life
was
done
and
he
felt
bitterly
alone
honors
were
offered
him
a
title
if
he
would
a
pension
but
he
declined
them
all
for
fifteen
years
life
dragged
along
then
at
the
age
of
he
died
he
might
have
lain
in
westminster
among
the
illustrious
dead
but
such
had
not
been
his
wish
so
he
was
buried
beside
his
father
and
mother
in
the
old
churchyard
at
ecclefechan
books
to
read
stories

thackeray
the
cynic
a
little
time
after
carlyle
french
revolution
was
published
he
wrote
to
his
brother
i
understand
there
have
been
many
reviews
of
a
very
mixed
character
i
got
one
in
the
times
last
week
the
writer
is
one
thackeray
a
cornish
giant
kind
of
painter
cambridge
man
and
paris
newspaper
correspondent
who
is
now
writing
for
his
life
in
london
his
article
is
rather
like
him
and
i
suppose
calculated
to
do
the
book
good
in
these
few
sentences
we
have
a
sketch
of
william
makepeace
thackeray
life
from
the
time
he
finished
his
education
up
to
the
age
of
when
carlyle
met
him
he
was
the
son
of
richmond
thackeray
a
collector
in
the
service
of
the
east
india
company
and
was
born
in
calcutta
in
little
as
his
mother
called
him
in
after
years
could
remember
very
little
of
india
he
remembered
seeing
crocodiles
and
a
very
tall
lean
father
when
billy
was
quite
a
tiny
chap
his
father
died
soon
after
the
little
boy
was
sent
home
as
indian
children
always
are
but
his
mother
remained
out
in
india
and
a
year
or
two
later
married
major
henry
carmichael
smyth
major
smyth
was
a
simple
kindly
gentleman
and
proved
a
good
stepfather
to
his
wife
little
boy
who
when
he
grew
up
and
became
famous
drew
his
stepfather
portrait
in
the
character
of
colonel
newcome
meanwhile
was
separated
from
both
father
and
mother
and
sailed
home
under
the
care
of
a
black
servant
his
ship
called
at
helena
and
there
the
black
servant
took
the
little
boy
on
a
long
walk
over
rocks
and
hills
until
they
came
to
a
garden
in
the
garden
a
man
was
walking
that
is
he
said
the
black
man
that
is
bonaparte
he
eats
three
sheep
every
day
and
all
the
little
children
he
can
lay
hands
on
ugh
we
think
that
the
little
boy
did
not
want
to
stay
there
long
william
reached
home
safely
and
was
very
happy
with
kind
aunts
and
grandmother
until
he
went
to
school
and
school
he
did
not
like
at
all
long
afterwards
in
one
of
his
books
he
wrote
it
was
governed
by
a
horrible
little
tyrant
who
made
our
young
lives
so
miserable
that
i
remember
kneeling
by
my
little
bed
of
a
night
and
saying
god
i
may
dream
of
my
mother
papers
but
he
left
this
school
and
when
he
was
about
eleven
went
to
charterhouse
here
thackeray
was
not
much
happier
he
was
a
pretty
gentle
boy
and
not
particularly
clever
either
at
games
or
at
lessons
the
boys
were
rough
and
even
brutal
to
each
other
and
thackeray
had
to
take
his
share
of
the
blows
and
got
a
broken
nose
which
disfigured
his
face
ever
after
and
when
he
left
school
he
took
away
with
him
a
painful
remembrance
of
all
he
had
had
to
suffer
but
by
degrees
the
suffering
faded
out
of
his
memory
and
he
looked
upon
his
old
school
with
kindly
eyes
and
called
it
no
longer
slaughterhouse
but
grey
friars
in
his
books
before
thackeray
went
to
charterhouse
his
mother
and
stepfather
had
come
home
to
england
and
made
a
home
for
the
little
boy
where
he
spent
happy
holidays
thackeray
was
not
very
diligent
but
in
his
last
term
at
school
he
writes
to
his
mother
i
really
think
i
am
becoming
terribly
industrious
though
i
ca
get
russell
the
headmaster
to
think
so
there
are
but
three
hundred
and
seventy
in
the
school
i
wish
there
were
only
three
hundred
and
soon
he
had
his
wish
and
leaving
charterhouse
he
went
to
trinity
college
cambridge
he
liked
cambridge
better
than
charterhouse
but
did
not
learn
much
more
in
little
more
than
a
year
he
left
because
he
felt
that
he
was
wasting
his
time
and
went
abroad
to
finish
his
education
after
spending
a
happy
year
in
germany
he
came
home
to
study
at
the
bar
but
soon
finding
he
had
no
taste
for
law
he
gave
that
up
thackeray
was
now
of
age
and
had
come
into
a
little
fortuned
of
about
pounds
a
year
left
to
him
by
his
father
so
he
decided
to
try
his
hand
at
literature
and
bought
a
paper
called
the
national
standard
and
became
editor
of
it
he
could
not
however
make
his
paper
pay
and
in
that
and
other
ways
he
had
soon
lost
all
his
money
it
was
now
necessary
that
he
should
do
something
to
earn
a
living
and
he
determined
to
be
an
artist
and
went
to
paris
to
study
but
although
he
was
fond
of
drawing
and
was
able
afterwards
to
illustrate
some
of
his
own
books
he
never
became
a
real
artist
meanwhile
in
paris
he
met
a
young
irish
lady
with
whom
he
fell
in
love
and
being
offered
the
post
of
paris
correspondent
on
another
paper
he
married
but
very
soon
after
he
married
the
paper
failed
and
thackeray
and
his
young
wife
returned
to
london
very
poor
indeed
and
there
he
remained
as
carlyle
said
writing
for
his
life
it
was
a
struggle
doubtless
but
not
a
bitter
one
and
thackeray
was
happy
in
his
home
with
his
wife
and
two
little
daughters
long
afterwards
one
of
these
daughters
wrote
almost
the
first
time
i
can
remember
my
parents
was
at
home
in
great
coram
street
on
one
occasion
when
my
mother
took
me
upon
her
back
as
she
had
a
way
of
doing
and
after
hesitating
for
a
moment
at
the
door
carried
me
into
a
little
ground
floor
room
where
some
one
sat
bending
over
a
desk
this
some
one
lifted
up
his
head
and
looked
round
at
the
people
leaning
over
his
chair
he
seemed
pleased
smiled
at
us
but
remonstrated
nowadays
i
know
by
experience
that
authors
do
get
on
best
as
a
rule
when
they
are
interrupted
in
their
work
not
even
by
their
own
particular
families
but
at
that
time
it
was
all
wondering
as
i
looked
over
my
mother
shoulder
but
these
happy
days
did
not
last
long
the
young
mother
became
ill
gradually
she
became
worse
until
at
last
the
light
of
reason
died
out
of
her
brain
and
although
she
lived
on
for
many
years
it
was
a
living
death
for
she
knew
no
one
and
took
no
notice
of
anything
that
went
on
around
her
the
happy
home
was
broken
up
the
children
went
to
live
with
their
who
found
them
inconveniently
young
while
thackeray
remained
alone
in
london
but
though
he
was
and
lonely
he
kept
a
loving
memory
of
the
happy
days
gone
by
long
after
he
wrote
to
a
friend
who
was
going
to
be
married
although
my
own
marriage
was
a
wreck
as
you
know
i
would
do
it
over
again
for
behold
love
is
the
crown
and
completion
of
all
earthly
good
the
man
who
is
afraid
of
his
future
never
deserved
one
thackeray
was
already
making
a
way
with
his
pen
and
now
he
found
a
new
opening
most
of
you
know
punch
he
and
his
dog
toby
are
old
friends
and
punch
with
his
humped
back
and
big
nose
comes
out
every
week
to
make
us
laugh
he
makes
us
laugh
too
with
kindly
laughter
for
as
thackeray
himself
said
there
never
were
before
published
in
this
world
so
many
volumes
that
contained
so
much
cause
for
laughing
so
little
for
blushing
it
is
easy
to
be
witty
and
wicked
so
hard
to
be
witty
and
wise
but
once
upon
a
time
there
was
no
punch
strange
though
it
may
seem
it
was
just
at
this
time
indeed
that
punch
was
published
and
thackeray
became
one
of
the
earliest
contributors
and
continued
for
ten
years
both
to
draw
pictures
and
write
papers
for
it
it
was
in
punch
that
his
famous
snob
papers
appeared
what
is
a
snob
thackeray
says
he
who
meanly
admires
mean
things
it
has
been
said
that
by
reason
of
writing
so
much
about
snobs
that
thackeray
came
to
see
snobbishness
where
there
was
none
but
certain
it
is
he
laid
a
smart
but
kindly
finger
on
many
a
prejudice
several
times
in
this
book
you
have
heard
of
sizars
and
commoners
stupid
distinctions
which
are
happily
now
done
away
with
perhaps
you
would
like
to
know
what
thackeray
thought
of
them
for
although
it
is
not
a
very
good
illustration
of
real
snobbishness
it
is
interesting
to
read
in
connection
with
the
lives
of
many
great
writer
if
you
consider
dear
reader
what
profound
snobbishness
the
university
system
produced
you
will
allow
that
it
is
time
to
attack
some
of
those
feudal
superstitions
if
you
go
down
for
five
shillings
to
look
at
the
youths
you
may
see
one
sneaking
down
the
court
without
a
tassel
to
his
cap
another
with
a
gold
or
silver
fringe
to
his
velvet
trencher
a
third
lad
with
a
master
gown
and
hat
walking
at
ease
over
the
sacred
college
which
common
men
must
not
tread
on
he
may
do
it
because
he
is
a
nobleman
because
a
lad
is
a
lord
the
university
gives
him
a
degree
at
the
end
of
two
years
which
another
is
seven
in
acquiring
because
he
is
a
lord
he
has
no
call
to
go
through
an
examination
the
lads
with
gold
and
silver
lace
are
sons
of
rich
gentlemen
and
called
fellow
commoners
they
are
privileged
to
feed
better
than
the
pensioners
and
to
have
wine
with
their
victuals
which
the
latter
can
only
get
in
their
rooms
the
unlucky
boys
who
have
no
tassels
to
their
caps
are
called
sizars
servitors
at
oxford
a
very
pretty
and
gentlemanlike
title
a
distinction
is
made
in
their
clothes
because
they
are
poor
for
which
reason
they
wear
a
badge
of
poverty
and
are
not
allowed
to
take
their
meals
with
their
fellow
students
but
the
same
pen
that
wrote
sharply
and
satirically
about
snobs
wrote
loving
letters
in
big
round
hand
to
his
dear
daughters
who
were
living
far
away
in
paris
for
either
child
he
used
a
different
hand
so
that
each
might
know
at
once
to
whom
the
letter
was
addressed
here
is
part
of
one
to
his
dearest
nanny
how
glad
i
am
that
it
is
a
black
puss
and
not
a
black
nuss
you
have
got
i
thought
you
did
not
know
how
to
spell
nurse
and
had
spelt
it
but
i
see
the
spelling
gets
better
as
the
letters
grow
longer
they
can
not
be
too
long
for
me
laura
must
be
a
very
girl
i
hope
my
dear
nanny
is
so
too
not
merely
to
her
school
mistress
and
friends
but
to
everybody
to
her
servants
and
her
nurses
i
would
sooner
have
you
gentle
and
than
ever
so
clever
who
was
born
on
christmas
day
somebody
who
was
so
great
that
all
the
world
worships
him
and
so
good
that
all
the
world
loves
him
and
so
gentle
and
humble
that
he
never
spoke
an
unkind
word
and
there
is
a
little
sermon
and
a
great
deal
of
love
and
affection
from
papa
ritchie
introduction
to
contributions
to
punch
the
book
of
snobs
brought
thackeray
into
notice
and
now
that
he
was
becoming
well
known
and
making
more
money
he
once
more
made
a
home
for
his
daughters
and
they
came
to
london
to
live
with
their
father
everything
was
new
and
strange
to
the
little
girls
there
was
a
feeling
of
london
they
thought
in
the
new
house
and
london
smelt
of
tobacco
thus
once
more
says
his
daughter
after
his
first
happy
married
years
my
father
had
a
home
and
a
family
if
a
house
two
young
children
three
servants
and
a
little
black
cat
can
be
called
a
family
thackeray
was
a
very
big
man
being
six
feet
three
or
four
he
must
have
seemed
a
very
big
papa
to
the
little
girls
of
six
and
eight
who
were
no
doubt
very
glad
to
be
again
beside
their
great
big
kind
father
and
he
on
his
side
was
very
glad
to
have
his
little
girls
to
love
and
he
took
them
about
a
great
deal
to
the
theater
and
concerts
they
helped
him
in
many
little
ways
and
thought
it
joy
to
leave
lessons
in
the
schoolroom
upstairs
and
come
downstairs
to
help
father
and
be
posed
as
models
for
his
drawings
it
was
now
that
thackeray
wrote
his
first
great
novel
his
greatest
some
people
think
vanity
fair
i
can
not
tell
you
about
it
now
but
when
you
are
a
very
little
older
you
will
like
to
read
of
clever
and
disagreeable
becky
sharp
of
dear
dobbin
and
foolish
amelia
and
all
the
rest
of
the
interesting
people
thackeray
creates
for
us
thackeray
has
been
called
a
cynic
that
is
one
who
does
not
believe
in
the
goodness
of
human
nature
and
who
sneers
at
and
finds
fault
with
everything
and
reading
vanity
fair
when
we
are
very
young
we
are
apt
to
think
that
is
so
but
later
we
come
to
see
the
heart
of
goodness
there
is
in
him
and
when
we
have
read
his
books
we
say
to
ourselves
what
a
truly
good
man
thackeray
must
have
been
he
could
not
have
painted
vanity
fair
as
he
has
says
another
writer
unless
eden
had
been
shining
brightly
in
his
inner
eyes
brimley
though
thackeray
is
no
cynic
he
is
a
satirist
as
much
as
pope
or
dryden
but
the
most
kindly
satirist
who
ever
wrote
his
thrusts
are
keen
and
yet
there
is
always
a
humorous
laugh
behind
and
never
a
spark
of
malice
or
uncharitableness
thackeray
bore
no
hatred
in
his
heart
towards
any
man
he
could
not
bear
to
give
pain
and
as
he
grew
older
his
satire
became
more
gentle
even
than
at
first
and
he
regretted
some
of
his
earlier
and
too
sharp
sayings
after
vanity
fair
other
novels
followed
the
best
of
all
being
esmond
esmond
is
perhaps
the
finest
historical
novel
in
our
language
it
is
a
story
of
the
time
of
queen
anne
and
when
we
read
it
we
feel
as
if
the
days
of
addison
and
steele
lived
again
but
with
thackeray
the
historical
novel
is
very
different
from
the
historical
novel
of
scott
with
thackeray
his
imaginary
people
hold
the
chief
place
the
real
people
only
form
a
background
while
in
many
of
scott
novels
the
real
people
claim
our
attention
most
before
esmond
was
written
thackeray
had
added
the
profession
of
lecturer
to
that
of
author
he
was
a
very
loving
father
and
was
always
anxious
not
only
that
his
daughters
should
be
happy
when
they
were
young
but
that
when
he
died
he
should
leave
them
well
off
again
and
again
in
his
letters
we
find
him
turning
to
this
thought
if
i
ca
leave
them
a
fortune
why
we
must
try
to
leave
them
the
memory
of
having
had
a
good
time
he
says
but
he
wanted
to
leave
them
a
fortune
and
so
he
took
to
lecturing
his
lectures
were
a
great
success
and
he
delivered
them
in
many
places
in
england
scotland
ireland
and
america
it
was
while
he
was
lecturing
in
scotland
that
he
heard
a
little
boy
read
one
of
his
ballads
it
was
a
satirical
ballad
and
somehow
thackeray
did
not
like
to
hear
it
from
the
little
lips
turning
away
he
said
to
himself
pray
god
i
may
be
able
some
day
to
write
something
good
for
children
that
will
be
better
than
glory
or
parliament
but
already
he
had
written
something
good
for
children
in
the
fairy
tale
of
the
rose
and
the
ring
one
year
he
spent
the
winter
with
his
children
in
rome
and
wrote
the
fairy
tale
for
them
and
their
friends
and
drew
the
pictures
too
i
have
no
room
in
this
book
to
tell
you
the
story
but
there
is
a
great
deal
of
fun
in
it
and
i
hope
you
will
read
it
for
yourselves
here
for
instance
is
what
happened
to
a
porter
for
being
rude
to
the
fairy
blackstick
after
saying
many
other
rude
things
he
asked
if
she
thought
he
was
going
to
stay
at
the
door
all
day
are
going
to
stay
at
that
door
all
day
and
all
night
and
for
many
a
long
year
the
fairy
said
very
majestically
and
gruffenuff
coming
out
of
the
door
straddling
before
it
with
his
great
calves
burst
out
laughing
and
cried
ha
ha
this
is
a
good
un
ha
ah
what
this
let
me
down
and
then
he
was
dumb
for
as
the
fairy
waved
her
wand
over
him
he
felt
himself
rising
off
the
ground
and
fluttering
up
against
the
door
and
then
as
if
a
screw
ran
into
his
stomach
he
felt
a
dreadful
pain
there
and
was
pinned
to
the
door
and
then
his
arms
flew
up
over
his
head
and
his
legs
after
writhing
about
wildly
twisted
under
his
body
and
he
felt
cold
cold
growing
over
him
as
if
he
was
turning
into
metal
and
he
said
and
could
say
no
more
because
he
was
dumb
he
was
turned
into
metal
he
was
from
being
brazen
brass
he
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
knocker
an
there
he
was
nailed
to
the
door
in
the
blazing
summer
day
till
he
burned
almost
and
there
he
was
nailed
to
the
door
all
the
bitter
winter
nights
till
his
brass
nose
was
dropping
with
icicles
and
the
postman
came
and
rapped
at
him
and
the
vulgarist
boy
with
a
letter
came
and
hit
him
up
against
the
door
and
the
king
and
queen
coming
home
from
a
walk
that
evening
the
king
said
my
dear
you
have
had
a
new
knocker
put
on
the
door
why
it
rather
like
our
porter
in
the
face
what
has
become
of
that
old
vagabond
and
the
housemaid
came
and
scrubbed
his
nose
with
and
once
when
the
princess
angelica
little
sister
was
born
he
was
tied
up
in
an
old
kid
glove
and
another
night
some
larking
young
men
tried
to
wrench
him
off
and
put
him
to
the
most
excruciating
agony
with
a
turnscrew
and
then
the
queen
had
a
fancy
to
have
the
colour
of
the
door
altered
and
the
painters
dabbed
him
over
the
mouth
and
eyes
and
nearly
choked
him
as
they
painted
him
i
warrant
he
had
leisure
to
repent
of
having
been
rude
to
the
fairy
blackstick
as
the
years
went
on
thackeray
became
ever
more
and
more
famous
his
company
more
and
more
sought
after
the
kind
tall
amusing
man
was
welcome
in
many
a
yet
with
all
his
success
he
never
forgot
his
little
girls
they
were
his
fast
friends
and
companions
and
very
often
they
wrote
while
he
dictated
his
story
to
them
he
worked
with
a
lazy
kind
of
diligence
he
could
not
like
scott
sit
down
and
write
a
certain
number
of
pages
every
morning
he
was
by
nature
indolent
yet
he
got
through
a
great
deal
of
work
houghton
death
found
him
still
working
steadily
he
had
not
been
feeling
well
and
one
evening
he
went
to
bed
early
next
morning
christmas
eve
of
he
was
found
dead
in
bed
deep
and
widespread
was
the
grief
of
thackeray
death
the
news
saddened
england
christmas
his
friends
mourned
not
only
the
loss
of
a
great
writer
but
the
cheerful
companionship
the
large
heart

the
simple
courteousness

he
was

the

dickens
smiles
and
tears
charles
dickens
was
a
novelist
who
lived
and
wrote
at
the
same
time
as
thackeray
he
was
indeed
only
six
months
younger
but
he
began
to
make
a
name
much
earlier
and
was
known
to
fame
while
thackeray
was
still
a
struggling
artist
when
they
both
became
famous
these
two
great
writers
were
to
some
extent
rivals
and
those
who
read
their
books
were
divided
into
two
camps
for
though
both
are
men
of
genius
they
are
men
of
widely
differing
genius
john
dickens
the
father
was
a
clerk
with
a
small
salary
in
the
navy
pay
office
and
his
son
charles
was
born
in
at
portsea
when
charles
was
about
four
his
father
was
moved
to
chatham
and
here
the
little
boy
charles
lived
until
he
was
nine
he
was
a
very
puny
little
boy
and
not
able
to
join
in
the
games
of
the
other
boys
of
his
own
age
so
he
spent
most
of
his
time
in
a
small
room
where
there
was
some
books
and
where
no
one
else
besides
himself
cared
to
go
he
not
only
read
the
books
but
lived
them
and
for
weeks
together
he
would
make
believe
to
himself
that
he
was
his
favorite
character
in
whatever
book
he
might
be
reading
all
his
life
he
loved
acting
a
part
and
being
somebody
else
and
at
one
time
thought
of
becoming
an
actor
then
when
charles
was
seven
he
went
to
a
school
taught
by
a
young
baptist
minister
it
was
not
an
unhappy
life
for
the
very
queer
small
boy
as
he
calls
himself
there
were
fields
in
which
he
could
play
his
pretending
games
and
there
was
a
beautiful
house
called
gad
hill
near
at
which
he
could
go
to
look
and
dream
that
if
he
were
very
good
and
very
clever
he
might
some
day
be
a
fine
gentleman
and
own
that
house
when
the
very
queer
small
boy
was
nine
he
and
all
his
family
moved
to
london
here
they
lived
in
a
mean
little
house
in
a
mean
little
street
there
were
now
six
children
and
the
father
had
grown
very
poor
so
instead
of
being
sent
to
school
charles
used
to
black
the
boots
and
make
himself
useful
about
the
house
but
he
still
had
his
books
to
read
and
could
still
make
believe
to
himself
things
grew
worse
and
worse
however
and
john
dickens
who
was
kind
and
careless
got
into
debt
deeper
and
deeper
everything
in
the
house
that
could
be
done
without
was
sold
and
one
by
one
the
precious
books
went
at
length
one
day
men
came
and
took
the
father
away
to
prison
because
he
could
not
pay
his
debts
then
began
for
charles
the
most
miserable
time
of
his
life
the
poor
sickly
little
chap
was
set
to
work
in
a
blacking
factory
his
work
was
to
cover
the
pots
of
tie
them
down
neatly
and
paste
on
the
labels
along
with
two
or
three
others
boys
he
worked
all
day
long
for
six
or
seven
shillings
a
week
oh
how
the
little
boy
hated
it
he
felt
degraded
and
ashamed
he
felt
that
he
was
forgotten
and
neglected
by
every
one
and
that
never
never
more
would
he
be
able
to
read
books
and
play
pretending
games
or
do
anything
that
he
loved
all
week
he
worked
hard
ill
clad
and
only
half
fed
and
sunday
he
spent
with
this
father
at
the
prison
it
was
a
miserable
sordid
and
pitiful
beginning
to
life
how
long
this
unhappy
time
lasted
we
do
not
know
dickens
himself
could
not
remember
he
seldom
spoke
of
this
time
but
he
never
forgot
the
misery
of
it
long
afterwards
in
one
of
his
books
called
david
copperfield
when
he
tells
of
the
unhappy
childhood
of
his
hero
it
is
of
his
own
he
speaks
but
presently
john
dickens
got
out
of
prison
charles
left
the
blacking
factory
and
once
more
went
to
school
and
although
in
after
years
he
could
never
bear
to
think
of
these
miserable
days
at
the
time
his
spirits
were
not
crushed
and
at
school
he
was
known
as
a
bright
and
jolly
boy
he
was
always
ready
for
any
mischief
and
took
delight
in
getting
up
theatricals
at
fifteen
dickens
left
school
and
went
into
a
lawyer
office
but
he
knew
that
he
had
learned
very
little
at
school
and
now
set
himself
to
learn
more
he
went
to
the
british
museum
and
studied
there
and
he
also
with
a
great
deal
of
labor
taught
himself
shorthand
he
worked
hard
determined
to
get
on
and
at
nineteen
he
found
himself
in
the
gallery
of
the
house
of
commons
as
reporter
for
a
daily
paper
since
the
days
when
samuel
johnson
reported
speeches
without
having
heard
them
things
had
changed
people
were
no
longer
content
with
such
reporting
and
dickens
proved
himself
one
of
the
smartest
reporters
there
had
ever
been
he
not
only
reported
the
speeches
but
told
of
everything
that
took
place
in
the
house
he
had
such
a
keen
eye
for
seeing
and
such
a
vivid
way
of
describing
what
he
saw
that
he
was
able
to
make
people
realize
the
scenes
inside
the
house
as
none
had
done
before
besides
reporting
in
the
houses
of
parliament
dickens
dashed
about
the
country
in
gathering
news
for
his
paper
writing
by
flickering
while
his
carriage
rushed
along
at
what
seemed
then
the
tremendous
speed
of
fifteen
miles
an
hour
for
those
were
not
the
days
of
railways
and
motors
and
traveling
was
much
slower
than
it
is
now
but
even
while
dickens
was
leading
this
hurried
busy
life
he
found
time
to
write
other
things
besides
newspaper
reports
and
little
tales
and
sketches
began
to
appear
signed
by
boz
boz
was
a
pet
name
for
dickens
youngest
brother
his
real
name
was
augustus
but
he
had
been
nicknamed
moses
after
moses
in
the
vicar
of
wakefield
pronounced
through
the
nose
it
became
boses
and
then
boz
that
is
the
history
of
the
name
under
which
dickens
at
first
wrote
and
won
his
earliest
fame
the
sketches
by
boz
were
well
received
but
real
fame
came
to
dickens
with
the
pickwick
papers
which
he
now
began
to
write
this
story
came
out
in
monthly
parts
the
first
few
numbers
were
not
very
successful
only
about
four
hundred
copies
being
sold
but
by
the
fifteenth
number
london
was
ringing
with
the
fame
of
it
and
forty
thousand
copies
were
quickly
sold
judges
on
the
bench
and
boys
in
the
street
gravity
and
folly
the
young
and
the
old
all
alike
read
it
and
laughed
over
it
dickens
above
everything
is
a
humorist
and
one
of
the
chief
features
in
his
humor
is
caricature
that
is
exaggerating
and
distorting
one
feature
or
habit
or
characteristic
of
a
man
out
of
all
likeness
to
nature
this
often
makes
very
good
fun
but
it
takes
away
from
the
truth
and
realness
of
his
characters
and
yet
no
teller
perhaps
is
remembered
so
little
for
his
stories
and
so
much
for
his
characters
in
pickwick
there
is
hardly
any
story
the
papers
ramble
on
in
unconnected
incidents
no
one
could
tell
the
story
of
pickwick
for
there
is
really
none
to
tell
it
is
a
series
of
scenes
which
hang
together
anyhow
pickwick
can
not
be
classed
as
a
novel
it
has
been
said
it
is
merely
a
great
book
so
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they
are
all
caricatures
it
is
the
persons
of
the
pickwick
club
that
we
remember
and
not
their
doings
like
jonson
long
before
him
dickens
sees
every
man
in
his
humor
by
his
genius
he
enables
us
to
see
these
humors
too
though
at
times
one
quality
in
a
man
is
shown
so
strongly
that
we
fail
to
see
any
other
in
him
and
so
a
caricature
is
produced
dickens
himself
was
full
of
fun
and
jollity
his
was
a
florid
personality
he
loved
light
and
color
and
sunshine
he
almost
covered
his
walls
with
and
crowded
his
garden
with
blazing
geraniums
he
loved
movement
and
life
overflowed
with
it
himself
and
poured
it
into
his
creations
making
them
live
in
spite
of
rather
than
because
of
their
absurdities
winkle
one
of
the
pickwickians
is
a
mild
and
foolish
boaster
who
pretends
that
he
can
do
things
he
can
not
he
pretends
to
be
able
to
shoot
and
succeeds
only
in
hitting
one
of
his
friends
he
pretends
to
skate
and
this
is
how
he
succeeds
said
wardle
after
a
substantial
lunch
had
been
done
ample
just
to
say
you
to
an
hour
on
the
ice
we
shall
have
plenty
of
time
said
benjamin
allen
ejaculated
bob
sawyer
skate
of
course
winkle
said
wardle
oh
yes
replied
winkle
i
am
rather
out
of
practice
do
skate
winkle
said
arabella
like
to
see
it
so
much
it
is
so
graceful
said
another
young
lady
a
third
young
lady
said
it
was
elegant
and
a
fourth
expressed
her
opinion
that
it
was
should
be
very
happy
i
sure
said
winkle
reddening
i
have
no
skates
this
objection
was
at
once
overruled
trundle
had
a
couple
of
pair
and
the
fat
boy
announced
that
there
were
more
downstairs
whereat
winkle
expressed
exquisite
delight
and
looked
exquisitely
uncomfortable
old
wardle
led
the
way
to
a
pretty
large
sheet
of
ice
and
the
fat
boy
and
weller
having
shovelled
and
swept
away
the
snow
which
had
fallen
on
it
during
the
night
bob
sawyer
adjusted
his
skates
with
a
dexterity
which
to
winkle
was
perfectly
marvellous
and
described
circles
with
his
left
leg
and
cut
figures
of
eight
and
inscribed
upon
the
ice
without
once
stopping
for
breath
a
great
many
other
pleasant
and
astonishing
devices
to
the
excessive
satisfaction
of
pickwick
tupman
and
the
ladies
which
reached
a
pitch
of
positive
enthusiasm
when
old
wardle
and
benjamin
allen
assisted
by
the
aforesaid
bob
sawyer
performed
some
mystic
evolutions
which
they
called
a
reel
all
this
time
winkle
with
his
face
and
hands
blue
with
the
cold
had
been
forcing
gimlet
into
the
soles
of
his
boots
and
putting
his
skates
on
with
the
points
behind
and
getting
the
straps
into
a
very
complicated
and
entangled
state
with
the
assistance
of
snodgrass
who
knew
rather
less
about
skates
than
a
hindoo
at
length
however
with
the
assistance
of
weller
the
unfortunate
skates
were
firmly
screwed
and
buckled
on
and
winkle
was
raised
to
his
feet
then
sir
said
sam
in
an
encouraging
tone
with
you
and
shoe
how
to
do
it
sam
stop
said
winkle
trembling
violently
and
clutching
hold
of
sam
arms
with
the
grasp
of
a
drowning
man
slippery
it
is
sam
a
uncommon
thing
upon
ice
sir
replied
weller
up
sir
this
last
observation
of
weller
bore
reference
to
a
demonstration
winkle
made
at
the
instant
of
a
frantic
desire
to
throw
his
feet
in
the
air
and
dash
the
back
of
his
head
on
the
ice
these
are
very
awkward
skates
ai
they
sam
inquired
winkle
staggering
afeerd
there
an
orkard
in
sir
replied
sam
winkle
cried
pickwick
quite
unconscious
that
here
was
anything
the
matter
the
ladies
are
all
anxiety
yes
replied
winkle
with
a
ghastly
smile
coming
to
begin
said
sam
endeavouring
to
disengage
himself
sir
start
off
an
instant
sam
gasped
winkle
clinging
most
affectionately
to
weller
find
i
got
a
couple
of
coats
at
home
that
i
do
want
sam
you
may
have
them
sam
sir
replied
weller
mind
touching
your
hat
sam
said
winkle
hastily
need
take
your
hand
away
to
do
that
i
meant
to
have
given
you
five
shillings
this
morning
for
a
sam
i
give
it
you
this
afternoon
sam
wery
good
sir
replied
weller

at
first
sam
will
you
said
winkle
that
right
i
shall
soon
get
in
the
way
of
it
sam
not
too
fast
sam
not
too
fast
winkle
stooping
forward
with
his
body
half
doubled
up
was
being
assisted
over
the
ice
by
weller
in
a
very
singular
and
manner
when
pickwick
most
innocently
shouted
from
the
opposite
bank
said
weller
i
want
you
go
sir
said
sam
you
hear
the
governor
callin
let
go
sir
with
a
violent
effort
weller
disengaged
himself
from
the
grasp
of
the
agonised
pickwickian
and
in
so
doing
administered
a
considerable
impetus
to
the
unhappy
winkle
with
an
accuracy
which
no
degree
of
dexterity
or
practice
could
have
insured
that
unfortunate
gentleman
bore
swiftly
down
into
the
centre
of
the
reel
at
the
very
moment
when
bob
sawyer
was
performing
a
flourish
of
unparalleled
beauty
winkle
struck
wildly
against
him
and
with
a
loud
crash
they
both
fell
heavily
down
pickwick
ran
to
the
spot
bob
sawyer
had
risen
to
his
feet
but
winkle
was
far
too
wise
to
do
anything
of
the
kind
in
skates
he
was
seated
on
the
ice
making
spasmodic
efforts
to
smile
but
anguish
was
depicted
on
every
lineament
of
his
countenance
you
hurt
inquired
benjamin
allen
with
great
anxiety
much
said
winkle
rubbing
his
back
very
hard
wish
you
let
me
bleed
you
said
benjamin
with
great
eagerness
thank
you
replied
winkle
hurriedly
do
you
think
mr
pickwick
enquired
bob
sawyer
pickwick
was
excited
and
indignant
he
beckoned
to
weller
and
said
in
a
stern
voice
his
skates
off
but
really
i
had
scarcely
begun
remonstrated
winkle
his
skates
off
repeated
pickwick
firmly
the
command
was
not
to
be
resisted
winkle
allowed
sam
to
obey
it
in
silence
him
up
said
pickwick
sam
assisted
him
to
rise
pickwick
retired
a
few
paces
apart
from
the
bystanders
and
beckoning
his
friend
to
approach
fixed
a
searching
look
upon
him
and
uttering
in
a
low
but
distinct
and
emphatic
tone
these
remarkable
words
a
humbug
sir
what
said
winkle
starting
humbug
sir
i
will
speak
plainer
if
you
wish
it
an
impostor
sir
with
these
words
pickwick
turned
slowly
on
his
heel
and
rejoined
his
friends
there
is
much
life
and
fun
and
jollity
and
some
vulgarity
in
pickwick
there
is
a
good
deal
of
eating
and
far
too
much
drinking
but
when
the
fun
is
rather
rough
we
must
remember
that
dickens
wrote
of
the
england
of
seventy
years
ago
and
more
when
life
was
rougher
than
it
is
now
and
when
people
did
not
see
that
drinking
was
the
sordid
sin
we
know
it
to
be
now
to
many
people
pickwick
remains
dickens
best
book
the
glory
of
charles
dickens
it
has
been
said
will
always
be
in
his
pickwick
his
first
his
best
his
inimitable
triumph
harrison
just
when
dickens
began
to
write
pickwick
he
married
and
soon
we
find
him
comfortably
settled
in
a
london
house
while
the
other
great
writers
of
his
day
gathered
round
him
as
his
friends
although
not
born
in
london
dickens
was
a
true
londoner
and
when
his
work
was
done
he
loved
nothing
better
than
to
roam
the
streets
he
was
a
great
walker
and
thought
nothing
of
going
twenty
or
thirty
miles
a
day
for
though
he
was
small
and
slight
he
had
quite
recovered
from
his
childish
sickliness
and
was
full
of
wiry
energy
the
crowded
streets
of
london
were
his
books
as
he
wandered
through
them
his
clear
blue
eyes
took
note
of
everything
and
when
he
was
far
away
among
the
lovely
sights
of
italy
or
switzerland
he
was
homesick
for
the
grimy
streets
and
hurrying
crowds
of
london
after
pickwick
many
other
stories
followed
in
them
dickens
showed
his
power
not
only
of
making
people
laugh
but
of
making
them
cry
for
the
source
of
laughter
and
the
source
of
tears
are
not
very
far
apart
there
is
scarcely
another
writer
whose
pathetic
scenes
are
so
famous
as
those
of
dickens
in
life
there
is
a
great
deal
that
is
sad
and
one
of
the
things
which
touched
dickens
most
deeply
was
the
misery
of
children
the
children
of
are
happy
in
knowing
nothing
of
the
miseries
of
childhood
as
it
was
in
the
days
when
dickens
wrote
in
those
days
tiny
children
had
to
work
ten
or
twelve
hours
a
day
in
factories
many
schools
were
places
of
terror
and
misery
and
few
people
cared
but
dickens
saw
and
cared
and
wrote
about
these
things
and
now
they
are
of
a
bygone
day
so
children
may
remember
dickens
with
thankful
hearts
he
is
one
of
their
great
champions
dickens
loved
children
and
they
loved
him
for
he
had
a
most
winning
way
with
them
and
he
understood
their
little
joys
and
sorrows
there
are
so
many
people
says
his
daughter
writing
about
her
father
there
are
so
many
people
good
kind
and
affectionate
but
who
can
not
remember
that
they
once
were
children
themselves
and
looked
out
upon
the
world
with
a
eyes
only
this
dickens
did
always
remember
and
it
made
him
a
tender
and
delightful
father
to
whom
his
children
looked
up
with
something
of
adoration
ever
since
i
can
remember
anything
says
his
daughter
i
remember
him
as
the
good
genius
of
the
house
or
as
its
happy
bright
and
funny
genius
as
thackeray
had
a
special
handwriting
for
each
daughter
dickens
had
a
special
voice
for
each
child
so
that
without
being
named
each
knew
when
he
or
she
was
spoken
to
he
sang
funny
songs
to
them
and
told
funny
stories
did
conjuring
tricks
and
got
up
theatricals
shared
their
fun
and
comforted
their
sorrows
and
this
same
power
of
understanding
which
made
him
enter
into
the
joys
and
sorrows
of
his
children
made
him
enter
into
the
joys
and
sorrows
of
the
big
world
around
him
so
that
the
people
of
that
big
world
loved
him
as
a
friend
and
adored
him
as
a
hero
as
the
years
went
on
dickens
wrote
more
and
more
books
he
started
a
magazine
too
first
called
household
words
and
later
all
the
year
round
in
this
some
of
his
own
works
came
out
as
well
as
the
works
of
other
writers
it
added
greatly
to
his
popularity
and
not
a
little
to
his
wealth
and
as
he
became
rich
and
famous
his
boyish
dream
came
true
he
bought
the
house
of
gad
hill
which
had
seemed
so
splendid
and
so
far
off
in
his
childish
eyes
and
went
to
live
there
with
his
big
family
of
growing
boys
and
girls
it
was
about
this
time
too
that
dickens
found
a
new
way
of
entertaining
the
world
he
not
only
wrote
books
but
he
himself
read
them
to
great
audiences
all
his
life
dickens
had
loved
acting
indeed
he
very
nearly
became
an
actor
before
he
found
out
his
great
powers
of
writing
he
many
times
took
part
in
private
theatricals
one
of
his
favorite
parts
you
will
like
to
know
being
captain
bobadil
in
jonson
every
man
in
his
humor
and
now
all
the
actor
in
him
delighted
in
the
reading
of
his
own
works
so
although
many
of
his
friends
were
very
much
against
these
readings
he
went
on
with
them
and
wherever
he
read
in
england
scotland
ireland
and
america
crowds
flocked
to
hear
him
dickens
swayed
his
audiences
at
will
he
made
them
laugh
and
cry
and
whether
they
cried
they
cheered
and
applauded
him
it
was
a
triumph
and
an
evidence
of
his
power
in
which
dickens
delighted
and
which
he
could
not
forego
although
his
friends
thought
it
was
beneath
his
dignity
as
an
author
but
the
strain
and
excitement
were
too
much
these
readings
broke
down
dickens
health
and
wore
him
out
he
was
at
last
forced
to
give
them
up
but
it
was
already
too
late
a
few
months
later
he
died
suddenly
one
evening
in
june
in
his
house
at
gad
hill
he
was
buried
in
westminster
and
although
the
funeral
was
very
quiet
and
simple
as
he
himself
had
wished
for
two
days
after
a
constant
stream
of
mourners
came
to
place
flowers
upon
his
grave
i
have
not
given
you
a
list
of
dicken
books
because
they
are
to
be
found
in
nearly
every
household
you
will
soon
be
able
to
read
them
and
learn
to
know
the
characters
whose
names
have
become
household
words
dickens
was
the
novelist
of
the
poor
the
shabby
genteel
and
the
lower
middle
class
it
has
been
said
many
times
that
in
all
his
novels
he
never
drew
for
us
a
single
gentleman
and
that
is
very
nearly
true
but
we
need
little
regret
that
for
he
has
left
us
a
rich
array
of
characters
we
might
never
otherwise
have
known
such
as
perhaps
no
other
man
could
have
pictured
for
us
books
to
read
stories
from
dickens
by
the
dickens
chapter
lxxxv
tennyson
the
poet
of
friendship
keats
had
lain
beneath
the
roman
violets
six
years
and
shelley
somewhat
less
than
five
when
a
little
volume
of
poems
was
published
in
england
it
was
called
poems
by
two
brothers
no
one
took
any
notice
of
it
and
yet
in
it
was
the
first
little
twitter
of
one
of
our
sweetest
singing
birds
for
the
two
brothers
were
alfred
and
charles
tennyson
boys
then
of
sixteen
and
seventeen
it
is
of
alfred
that
i
mean
to
tell
you
in
this
last
chapter
you
have
heard
of
him
already
in
one
of
the
chapters
on
the
arthur
story
and
also
you
have
heard
of
him
as
a
friend
of
carlyle
and
now
i
will
tell
you
a
little
more
about
him
alfred
tennyson
was
born
in
in
the
lincolnshire
village
of
somersby
his
father
was
the
rector
there
and
had
besides
alfred
eleven
other
children
and
here
about
the
rectory
garden
orchard
and
fields
the
tennyson
children
played
at
knights
and
warriors
beyond
the
field
flowed
a
brook
that
loves
to
purl
matted
cress
and
ribbed
sand
or
dimple
in
the
dark
of
rushy
coves
drawing
into
his
narrow
earthen
urn
in
every
elbow
and
turn
the
filter
tribute
of
the
rough
woodland
to
memory
of
the
garden
and
the
fields
and
of
the
brook
especially
alfred
kept
a
memory
all
through
his
long
life
but
at
seven
he
was
sent
to
live
with
his
grandmother
and
go
to
school
at
louth
about
ten
miles
away
how
i
did
hate
that
school
he
said
long
afterwards
so
we
may
suppose
the
years
he
spent
there
were
not
altogether
happy
but
when
he
was
eleven
he
went
home
again
to
be
taught
by
his
father
until
he
went
to
cambridge
at
home
alfred
read
a
great
deal
especially
poetry
he
wrote
too
romances
like
sir
walter
scott
full
of
battles
epics
in
the
manner
of
pope
plays
and
blank
verse
he
wrote
so
much
that
his
father
said
if
alfred
die
one
of
our
greatest
poets
will
have
gone
and
besides
writing
poems
alfred
who
was
one
of
the
big
children
used
to
tell
stories
to
the
little
ones
stories
these
of
knights
and
ladies
giants
and
dragons
and
all
manner
of
wonderful
things
so
the
years
passed
and
one
day
the
two
boys
charles
and
alfred
resolved
to
print
their
poems
and
took
them
to
a
bookseller
in
louth
he
gave
them
pounds
for
the
manuscript
but
more
than
half
was
paid
in
books
out
of
the
shop
so
the
grand
beginning
was
made
but
the
little
book
caused
no
stir
in
the
great
world
no
one
knew
that
a
poet
had
broken
silence
the
next
year
charles
and
alfred
went
to
cambridge
alfred
soon
made
many
friends
among
the
clever
young
men
of
his
day
chief
among
them
being
arthur
hallam
whose
father
was
a
famous
historian
at
college
tennyson
won
the
chancellor
prize
for
a
poem
on
timbuctoo
and
the
following
year
he
published
a
second
little
volume
of
poems
this
though
kindly
received
by
some
great
writers
made
hardly
more
stir
than
the
little
volume
by
two
brothers
tennyson
did
not
take
a
degree
at
cambridge
for
owing
to
his
father
failing
health
he
was
called
home
he
left
college
perhaps
with
no
very
keen
regret
for
his
heart
was
not
in
sympathy
with
the
teaching
in
his
undergraduate
days
he
wrote
some
scathing
lines
about
it
you
teach
us
nothing
he
said
feeding
not
the
heart
but
he
did
remember
with
tenderness
that
cambridge
had
been
the
spot
where
his
first
and
warmest
friendship
had
been
formed
soon
after
alfred
left
college
his
father
died
very
suddenly
although
the
father
was
now
gone
the
tennysons
did
not
need
to
leave
their
home
for
the
new
rector
did
not
want
the
house
so
life
in
the
rectory
went
quietly
on
friends
came
and
went
the
dearest
friend
of
all
arthur
hallam
came
often
for
he
loved
the
poet
young
sister
and
one
day
they
were
to
be
married
it
was
a
peaceful
happy
time
and
all
we
met
was
fair
and
good
and
all
was
good
that
time
could
bring
and
all
the
secret
of
the
spring
moved
in
the
chambers
of
the
blood
long
days
were
spent
reading
poetry
and
talking
of
many
things
or
in
the
afternoon
a
guest
or
happy
sister
sung
or
here
she
brought
the
harp
and
flung
a
ballad
to
the
brightening
moon
nor
less
it
pleased
the
livelier
moods
beyond
the
bounding
hill
to
stray
and
break
the
live
long
summer
day
with
banquet
in
the
distant
woods
and
amid
this
pleasant
country
life
the
poet
worked
on
and
presently
another
little
book
of
poems
appeared
still
fame
did
not
come
and
one
severe
and
blundering
review
kept
tennyson
it
is
said
from
publishing
anything
more
for
ten
years
but
now
there
fell
upon
him
what
was
perhaps
the
darkest
sorrow
of
his
life
arthur
hallam
who
was
traveling
on
the
continent
died
suddenly
at
vienna
when
the
news
came
to
tennyson
that
his
friend
was
gone
that
in
vienna
fatal
walls
god
finger
touch
him
and
he
slept
for
a
time
joy
seemed
blotted
out
of
life
and
only
that
he
might
help
to
comfort
his
sister
did
he
wish
to
live
for
that
remorseless
iron
hour
made
cypress
of
her
orange
flower
despair
of
hope
as
an
outcome
of
this
grief
we
have
one
of
tennyson
finest
poems
in
memoriam
it
is
an
elegy
which
we
place
beside
lycidas
and
adonais
but
in
memoriam
strikes
yet
a
sadder
note
for
in
lycidas
and
adonais
milton
and
shelley
mourned
kindred
souls
rather
than
dear
loved
friends
to
tennyson
arthur
hallam
was
the
brother
of
my
love
dear
as
the
mother
to
the
son
more
than
my
brothers
are
to
me
in
memoriam
is
a
group
of
poems
rather
than
one
long
poem
short
of
song
that
dip
their
wings
in
tears
and
skim
away
it
is
written
in
a
meter
which
tennyson
believed
he
had
invented
but
which
ben
jonson
and
others
had
used
before
him
two
hundred
years
before
jonson
had
written
a
little
elegy
beginning
though
beautie
be
the
marke
of
praise
and
yours
of
whom
i
sing
be
such
as
not
the
world
can
praise
too
much
yet
your
vertue
now
i
raise
here
again
we
see
that
our
literature
of
is
no
new
born
thing
but
rooted
in
the
past
jonson
poem
however
is
a
mere
trifle
tennyson
one
of
the
great
things
of
our
literature
the
first
notes
of
in
memoriam
were
written
when
sorrow
was
fresh
but
it
was
not
till
seventeen
years
later
that
it
was
given
to
the
world
it
is
perhaps
the
most
perfect
monument
ever
raised
to
friendship
for
in
mourning
his
own
loss
tennyson
mourned
the
loss
of
all
the
world
is
not
always
the
author
speaking
of
himself
but
the
voice
of
the
human
race
speaking
thro
him
he
says
after
the
prologue
the
poem
tells
of
the
first
bitter
hopeless
grief
of
how
friends
try
to
comfort
the
mourners
one
writes
that
friends
remain
that
is
common
to
the
race
and
common
is
the
and
vacant
chaff
well
meant
for
grain
that
loss
if
common
would
not
make
my
own
less
bitter
rather
more
too
common
never
morning
wore
to
evening
but
some
heart
did
break
and
yet
even
now
he
can
say
i
hold
it
true
befall
i
feel
it
when
i
sorrow
most
is
better
to
have
loved
and
lost
than
never
to
have
loved
at
all
and
so
the
months
glide
by
and
the
first
christmas
comes
the
time
draws
near
the
birth
of
christ
the
bells
ring
peace
and
goodwill
goodwill
and
peace
peace
and
goodwill
to
all
mankind
this
year
i
slept
and
woke
with
pain
i
almost
wish
no
more
to
wake
and
that
my
hold
on
life
would
break
before
i
heard
those
bells
again
but
when
christmas
comes
again
the
year
has
brought
calm
if
not
forgetfulness
again
at
christmas
did
we
weave
the
holly
round
the
christmas
hearth
the
silent
snow
possess
the
earth
and
calmly
fell
our
the
sparkled
keen
with
frost
no
wing
of
wind
the
region
swept
but
over
all
things
brooding
slept
the
quiet
sense
of
something
lost
as
in
the
winters
left
behind
again
our
ancient
games
had
place
the
mimic
picture
breathing
grace
and
dance
and
song
and
the
years
pass
on
the
brothers
and
sisters
grow
up
and
scatter
and
at
last
the
old
home
has
to
be
left
sadly
the
poet
takes
leave
of
all
the
loved
spots
in
house
and
garden
strangers
will
soon
come
there
people
who
will
neither
care
for
nor
love
the
dear
familiar
scene
we
leave
the
place
where
first
we
gazed
upon
the
sky
the
roofs
that
heard
our
earliest
cry
will
shelter
one
of
stranger
race
we
go
but
ere
we
go
from
home
as
down
the
i
move
two
spirits
of
a
diverse
love
contend
for
loving
masterdom
one
whispers
thy
boyhood
sung
long
since
its
matin
song
and
heard
the
low
of
the
bird
in
native
hazels
the
other
answers
but
here
thy
feet
have
stray
in
after
hours
with
thy
lost
friend
among
the
bowers
and
this
hath
made
them
trebly
dear
the
poem
moves
on
and
once
again
in
the
new
home
christmas
comes
round
here
everything
is
strange
the
very
bells
seem
like
strangers
voices
but
with
this
new
life
new
strength
has
come
and
sorrow
has
henceforth
lost
its
sting
and
with
the
ringing
of
the
new
year
bells
a
new
tone
comes
into
the
poem
a
tone
no
more
of
despair
but
of
hope
ring
out
wild
bells
to
the
wild
sky
the
flying
cloud
the
frosty
light
the
year
is
dying
in
the
night
ring
out
wild
bells
and
let
him
die
ring
out
the
old
ring
in
the
new
ring
happy
bells
across
the
snow
the
year
is
going
let
him
go
ring
out
the
false
ring
in
the
true
ring
out
the
grief
that
saps
the
mind
for
those
that
here
we
see
no
more
ring
out
the
feud
of
rich
and
poor
ring
in
redress
to
all
mankind
ring
in
the
valiant
man
and
free
the
larger
heart
the
kindlier
hand
ring
out
the
darkness
of
the
land
ring
in
the
christ
that
is
to
be
after
this
the
tone
of
the
poem
changes
and
the
poet
says
i
will
not
shut
me
from
my
kind
and
lest
i
stiffen
into
stone
i
will
not
eat
my
heart
alone
nor
feed
with
sighs
a
passing
wind
regret
is
dead
but
love
is
more
than
in
the
summers
that
are
flown
for
i
myself
with
these
have
grown
to
something
greater
than
before
one
more
event
is
recorded
the
wedding
of
the
poet
younger
sister
nine
years
after
the
death
of
his
friend
and
with
this
note
of
gladness
and
hope
in
the
future
the
poem
ends
time
heals
all
things
and
time
healed
tennyson
grief
but
there
was
another
reason
of
which
we
hardly
catch
a
glimpse
in
the
poem
for
his
return
to
peace
and
hope
another
love
had
come
into
his
life
the
love
of
the
lady
who
one
day
was
to
be
his
wife
at
first
however
it
seemed
a
hopeless
love
for
in
spite
of
his
growing
reputation
as
a
poet
tennyson
was
still
poor
too
poor
to
marry
and
so
for
fourteen
years
he
worked
and
waited
at
times
wellnigh
losing
hope
but
at
length
the
waiting
was
over
and
the
wedding
took
place
tennyson
amused
the
guests
by
saying
that
it
was
the
nicest
wedding
he
had
ever
been
at
and
long
afterwards
with
solemn
thankfulness
he
said
speaking
of
his
wife
the
peace
of
god
came
into
my
life
before
the
altar
when
i
wedded
her
a
few
months
before
the
wedding
wordsworth
had
died
one
night
a
few
months
after
it
tennyson
dreamt
that
the
prince
consort
came
and
kissed
him
on
the
cheek
very
kind
but
very
german
he
said
in
his
dream
next
morning
a
letter
arrived
offering
him
the
laureateship
one
of
the
first
poems
tennyson
wrote
as
laureate
was
his
ode
on
the
death
of
wellington
few
people
liked
it
at
the
time
but
now
it
has
taken
its
place
among
our
fine
poems
and
many
of
its
lines
are
familiar
household
words
of
tennyson
many
beautiful
short
poems
there
is
no
room
here
to
tell
he
wrote
several
plays
too
but
they
are
among
the
least
read
and
the
least
remembered
of
his
works
for
tennyson
was
a
lyrical
rather
than
a
dramatic
poet
his
long
poems
besides
in
memoriam
are
the
princess
maud
and
the
idylls
of
the
king
the
princess
is
perhaps
the
first
of
tennyson
long
poems
that
you
will
like
to
read
it
is
full
of
gayety
young
life
and
color
it
is
a
mock
heroic
tale
of
a
princess
who
does
not
wish
to
marry
and
who
founds
a
college
for
women
within
the
walls
of
which
no
man
may
enter
but
the
prince
to
whom
the
princess
has
been
betrothed
since
childhood
and
who
loves
her
from
having
seen
her
portrait
only
enters
with
his
friends
disguised
as
women
students
the
result
is
confusion
war
and
finally
peace
the
story
must
not
be
taken
too
seriously
it
is
a
poem
not
a
treatise
but
it
is
interesting
especially
at
this
time
for
even
you
who
read
this
book
must
know
that
the
question
has
not
yet
been
settled
as
to
how
far
a
woman
ought
to
be
educated
and
take
her
share
in
the
world
work
but
forget
that
and
read
it
only
for
its
poetry
the
princess
is
in
blank
verse
but
throughout
there
are
scattered
beautiful
songs
which
add
to
the
charm
here
is
one
of
the
most
musical
sweet
and
low
sweet
and
low
wind
of
the
western
sea
low
low
breathe
and
blow
wind
of
the
western
sea
over
the
rolling
waters
go
come
from
the
dying
moon
and
blow
blow
him
again
to
me
while
my
little
one
while
my
pretty
one
sleeps
sleep
and
rest
sleep
and
rest
father
will
come
to
thee
soon
rest
rest
on
mother
breast
father
will
come
to
thee
soon
father
will
come
to
his
babe
in
the
nest
silver
sails
all
out
of
the
west
under
the
silver
moon
sleep
my
little
one
sleep
my
pretty
one
sleep
in
the
idylls
of
the
king
tennyson
as
you
have
already
heard
in
chapter
ix
used
the
old
story
of
arthur
he
used
the
old
story
but
he
wove
into
it
something
new
for
we
are
meant
to
see
in
his
twelve
tales
of
the
round
table
an
allegory
we
are
meant
to
see
the
struggle
between
what
is
base
and
what
is
noble
in
human
nature
but
this
inner
meaning
is
not
always
easy
to
follow
and
we
may
cast
the
allegory
aside
and
still
have
left
to
us
beautiful
tales
which
carry
us
away
into
a
strange
wonderland
like
the
faery
queen
the
idylls
of
the
king
is
full
of
pictures
here
we
find
a
fairy
city
towered
and
turreted
dark
woods
wild
wastes
and
swamps
slow
gliding
rivers
all
in
a
misty
dreamland
and
this
dreamland
is
peopled
by
knights
and
ladies
who
move
through
it
clad
in
radiant
robes
and
glittering
armor
jewels
and
rich
coloring
gleam
and
glow
to
the
eye
songs
fall
upon
the
ear
and
over
all
rules
the
blameless
king
and
arthur
and
his
knighthood
for
a
space
were
all
one
will
and
thro
that
strength
the
king
drew
in
the
petty
princedoms
under
him
fought
and
in
twelve
great
battles
overcame
the
heathen
hordes
and
made
a
realm
and
reign
one
story
of
the
idylls
i
have
already
told
you
some
day
you
will
read
the
others
and
learn
for
yourselves
this
old
imperfect
tale
and
shadowing
sense
at
war
with
soul
rather
than
that
gray
king
whose
name
a
ghost
streams
like
a
cloud
from
mountain
peak
and
cleaves
to
cairn
and
cromlech
still
or
him
of
geoffrey
book
or
him
of
malleor
tennyson
led
a
peaceful
simple
life
he
made
his
home
for
the
most
part
in
the
isle
of
wight
here
he
lived
quietly
surrounded
by
his
family
but
sought
after
by
all
the
great
people
of
his
day
he
refused
a
baronetcy
but
at
length
in
accepted
a
peerage
and
became
lord
tennyson
the
first
baron
of
his
name
he
was
the
first
peer
to
receive
the
title
purely
because
of
his
literary
work
and
so
with
gathering
honors
and
gathering
years
the
poet
lived
and
worked
a
splendid
old
man
then
at
the
goodly
age
of
he
died
in
the
autumn
of
he
was
buried
in
westminster
not
far
from
chaucer
and
as
he
was
laid
among
the
mighty
dead
the
choir
sang
crossing
the
bar
one
of
his
latest
and
most
beautiful
poems
sunset
and
evening
star
and
one
clear
call
for
me
and
may
there
be
no
moaning
of
the
bar
when
i
put
out
to
sea
but
such
a
tide
as
moving
seems
asleep
too
full
for
sound
and
foam
when
that
which
drew
from
out
the
boundless
deep
turns
again
home
twilight
and
evening
bell
and
after
that
the
dark
and
may
there
be
no
sadness
of
farewell
when
i
embark
for
tho
from
out
our
bourne
of
time
and
place
the
flood
may
bear
me
far
i
hope
to
see
my
pilot
face
to
face
when
i
have
crost
the
bar
with
tennyson
i
end
my
book
because
my
design
was
not
to
give
you
a
history
of
our
literature
as
it
is
now
so
much
as
to
show
you
how
it
grew
to
be
what
it
is
in
the
beginning
of
this
book
i
took
the
arthur
story
as
a
pattern
or
type
of
how
a
story
grew
showing
how
it
passed
through
many
stages
in
each
stage
gaining
something
of
beauty
and
of
breadth
in
the
same
way
i
have
tried
to
show
how
from
a
rough
foundation
of
minstrel
tales
and
monkish
legends
the
great
palace
of
our
literature
has
slowly
risen
to
be
a
glorious
house
of
song
it
is
only
an
outline
that
i
have
given
you
there
are
some
great
names
that
demand
our
reverence
many
that
call
for
our
love
for
whom
no
room
has
been
found
in
this
book
for
our
literature
is
so
great
a
thing
that
no
one
book
can
compass
it
no
young
brain
comprehend
it
but
if
i
have
awakened
in
you
a
desire
to
know
more
of
our
literature
a
desire
to
fill
in
and
color
for
yourselves
this
outline
picture
i
shall
be
well
repaid
and
have
succeeded
in
what
i
aimed
at
doing
if
i
have
helped
you
to
see
that
literature
need
be
no
dreary
lesson
i
shall
be
more
than
repaid
they
use
me
as
a
at
schools
said
tennyson
and
they
will
call
me
horrible
tennyson
i
should
like
to
think
that
the
time
is
coming
when
schoolgirls
and
schoolboys
will
say
we
have
tennyson
for
a
how
nice
i
should
like
to
think
that
they
will
say
this
not
only
of
tennyson
but
of
many
other
of
our
great
writers
whose
very
names
come
as
rest
and
refreshment
to
those
of
us
who
have
learned
to
love
them
book
to
read
tennyson
for
the
young
alfred
ainger
