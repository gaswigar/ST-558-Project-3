chapter
ix
ancient
deities
of
vegetation
as
animals
dionysus
the
goat
and
the
bull
however
we
may
explain
it
the
fact
remains
that
in
peasant
the
is
very
commonly
conceived
and
represented
in
animal
form
may
not
this
fact
explain
the
relation
in
which
certain
animals
stood
to
the
ancient
deities
of
vegetation
dionysus
demeter
adonis
attis
and
osiris
to
begin
with
dionysus
we
have
seen
that
he
was
represented
sometimes
as
a
goat
and
sometimes
as
a
bull
as
a
goat
he
can
hardly
be
separated
from
the
minor
divinities
the
pans
satyrs
and
silenuses
all
of
whom
are
closely
associated
with
him
and
are
represented
more
or
less
completely
in
the
form
of
goats
thus
pan
was
regularly
portrayed
in
sculpture
and
painting
with
the
face
and
legs
of
a
goat
the
satyrs
were
depicted
with
pointed
and
sometimes
with
sprouting
horns
and
short
tails
they
were
sometimes
spoken
of
simply
as
goats
and
in
the
drama
their
parts
were
played
by
men
dressed
in
goatskins
silenus
is
represented
in
art
clad
in
a
goatskin
further
the
fauns
the
italian
counterpart
of
the
greek
pans
and
satyrs
are
described
as
being
half
goats
with
and
again
all
these
minor
divinities
partake
more
or
less
clearly
of
the
character
of
woodland
deities
thus
pan
was
called
by
the
arcadians
the
lord
of
the
wood
the
silenuses
associated
with
the
the
fauns
are
expressly
designated
as
woodland
deities
and
their
character
as
such
is
still
further
brought
out
by
their
association
or
even
identification
with
silvanus
and
the
silvanuses
who
as
their
name
of
itself
indicates
are
spirits
of
the
woods
lastly
the
association
of
the
satyrs
with
the
silenuses
fauns
and
silvanuses
proves
that
the
satyrs
also
were
woodland
deities
these
spirits
of
the
woods
have
their
counterparts
in
the
of
northern
europe
thus
the
russian
called
from
wood
are
believed
to
appear
partly
in
human
shape
but
with
the
horns
ears
and
legs
of
goats
the
can
alter
his
stature
at
pleasure
when
he
walks
in
the
wood
he
is
as
tall
as
the
trees
when
he
walks
in
the
meadows
he
is
no
higher
than
the
grass
some
of
the
are
spirits
of
the
corn
as
well
as
of
the
wood
before
harvest
they
are
as
tall
as
the
but
after
it
they
shrink
to
the
height
of
the
stubble
this
brings
we
have
remarked
close
connexion
between
and
and
shews
how
easily
the
former
may
melt
into
the
latter
similarly
the
fauns
though
were
believed
to
foster
the
growth
of
the
crops
we
have
already
seen
how
often
the
is
represented
in
as
a
goat
on
the
whole
then
as
mannhardt
argues
the
pans
satyrs
and
fauns
perhaps
belong
to
a
widely
diffused
class
of
conceived
in
the
fondness
of
goats
for
straying
in
woods
and
nibbling
the
bark
of
trees
to
which
indeed
they
are
most
destructive
is
an
obvious
and
perhaps
sufficient
reason
why
should
so
often
be
supposed
to
take
the
form
of
goats
the
inconsistency
of
a
god
of
vegetation
subsisting
upon
the
vegetation
which
he
personifies
is
not
one
to
strike
the
primitive
mind
such
inconsistencies
arise
when
the
deity
ceasing
to
be
immanent
in
the
vegetation
comes
to
be
regarded
as
its
owner
or
lord
for
the
idea
of
owning
the
vegetation
naturally
leads
to
that
of
subsisting
on
it
we
have
already
seen
that
the
originally
conceived
as
immanent
in
the
corn
afterwards
comes
to
be
regarded
as
its
owner
who
lives
on
it
and
is
reduced
to
poverty
and
want
by
being
deprived
of
it
thus
the
representation
of
in
the
form
of
goats
appears
to
be
both
widespread
and
to
the
primitive
mind
natural
therefore
when
we
find
as
we
have
done
that
sometimes
represented
in
we
can
hardly
avoid
concluding
that
this
representation
is
simply
a
part
of
his
proper
character
as
a
and
is
not
to
be
explained
by
the
fusion
of
two
distinct
and
independent
worships
in
one
of
which
he
originally
appeared
as
a
and
in
the
other
as
a
goat
if
such
a
fusion
took
place
in
the
case
of
dionysus
it
must
equally
have
taken
place
in
the
case
of
the
pans
and
satyrs
of
greece
the
fauns
of
italy
and
the
of
russia
that
such
a
fusion
of
two
wholly
disconnected
worships
should
have
occurred
once
is
possible
that
it
should
have
occurred
twice
independently
is
improbable
that
it
should
have
occurred
thrice
independently
is
so
unlikely
as
to
be
practically
incredible
dionysus
was
also
figured
as
we
have
seen
in
the
shape
of
a
bull
after
what
has
gone
before
we
are
naturally
led
to
expect
that
his
bull
form
must
have
been
only
another
expression
for
his
character
as
a
deity
of
vegetation
especially
as
the
bull
is
a
common
embodiment
of
the
in
northern
europe
and
the
close
association
of
dionysus
with
demeter
and
persephone
in
the
mysteries
of
eleusis
shews
that
he
had
at
least
strong
agricultural
affinities
the
other
possible
explanation
of
the
dionysus
would
be
that
the
conception
of
him
as
a
bull
was
originally
entirely
distinct
from
the
conception
of
him
as
a
deity
of
vegetation
and
that
the
fusion
of
the
two
conceptions
was
due
to
some
such
circumstance
as
the
union
of
two
tribes
one
of
which
had
previously
worshipped
a
and
the
other
a
this
appears
to
be
the
view
taken
by
andrew
lang
who
suggests
that
the
dionysus
had
either
been
developed
out
of
or
had
succeeded
to
the
worship
of
a
of
course
this
is
possible
but
it
is
not
yet
certain
that
the
aryans
ever
had
totemism
on
the
other
hand
it
is
quite
certain
that
many
aryan
peoples
have
conceived
deities
of
vegetation
as
embodied
in
animal
forms
therefore
when
we
find
amongst
an
aryan
people
like
the
greeks
a
deity
of
vegetation
represented
as
an
animal
the
presumption
must
be
in
favour
of
explaining
this
by
a
principle
which
is
certainly
known
to
have
influenced
the
aryan
race
rather
than
by
one
which
is
not
certainly
known
to
have
done
so
in
the
present
state
of
our
knowledge
therefore
it
is
safer
to
regard
the
bull
form
of
dionysus
as
being
like
his
goat
form
an
expression
of
his
proper
character
as
a
deity
of
vegetation
the
probability
of
this
view
will
be
somewhat
increased
if
it
can
be
shewn
that
in
other
rites
than
those
of
dionysus
the
ancients
slew
an
ox
as
a
representative
of
the
spirit
of
vegetation
this
they
appear
to
have
done
in
the
athenian
sacrifice
known
as
the
murder
of
the
ox
it
took
place
about
the
end
of
june
or
beginning
of
july
that
is
about
the
time
when
the
threshing
is
nearly
over
in
attica
according
to
tradition
the
sacrifice
was
instituted
to
procure
a
cessation
of
drought
and
dearth
which
had
afflicted
the
land
the
ritual
was
as
follows
barley
mixed
with
wheat
or
cakes
made
of
them
were
laid
upon
the
bronze
altar
of
zeus
polieus
on
the
acropolis
oxen
were
driven
round
the
altar
and
the
ox
which
went
up
to
the
altar
and
ate
the
offering
on
it
was
sacrificed
the
axe
and
knife
with
which
the
beast
was
slain
had
been
previously
wetted
with
water
brought
by
maidens
called
the
weapons
were
then
sharpened
and
handed
to
the
butchers
one
of
whom
felled
the
ox
with
the
axe
and
another
cut
its
throat
with
the
knife
as
soon
as
he
had
felled
the
ox
the
former
threw
the
axe
from
him
and
fled
and
the
man
who
cut
the
beast
s
throat
apparently
imitated
his
example
meantime
the
ox
was
skinned
and
all
present
partook
of
its
flesh
then
the
hide
was
stuffed
with
straw
and
sewed
up
next
the
stuffed
animal
was
set
on
its
feet
and
yoked
to
a
plough
as
if
it
were
ploughing
a
trial
then
took
place
in
an
ancient
presided
over
by
the
king
as
he
was
called
to
determine
who
had
murdered
the
ox
the
maidens
who
had
brought
the
water
accused
the
men
who
had
sharpened
the
axe
and
knife
the
men
who
had
sharpened
the
axe
and
knife
blamed
the
men
who
had
handed
these
implements
to
the
butchers
the
men
who
had
handed
the
implements
to
the
butchers
blamed
the
butchers
and
the
butchers
laid
the
blame
on
the
axe
and
knife
which
were
accordingly
found
guilty
condemned
and
cast
into
the
sea
the
name
of
this
sacrifice
the
of
the
ox
pains
taken
by
each
person
who
had
a
hand
in
the
slaughter
to
lay
the
blame
on
some
one
else
together
with
the
formal
trial
and
punishment
of
the
axe
or
knife
or
both
prove
that
the
ox
was
here
regarded
not
merely
as
a
victim
offered
to
a
god
but
as
itself
a
sacred
creature
the
slaughter
of
which
was
sacrilege
or
murder
this
is
borne
out
by
a
statement
of
varro
that
to
kill
an
ox
was
formerly
a
capital
crime
in
attica
the
mode
of
selecting
the
victim
suggests
that
the
ox
which
tasted
the
corn
was
viewed
as
the
taking
possession
of
his
own
this
interpretation
is
supported
by
the
following
custom
in
beauce
in
the
district
of
orleans
on
the
or
of
april
they
make
a
called
the
great
for
they
say
that
the
old
is
now
dead
and
it
is
necessary
to
make
a
new
one
the
is
carried
in
solemn
procession
up
and
down
the
village
and
at
last
is
placed
upon
the
oldest
there
he
remains
till
the
apples
are
gathered
when
he
is
taken
down
and
thrown
into
the
water
or
he
is
burned
and
his
ashes
cast
into
water
but
the
person
who
plucks
the
first
fruit
from
the
tree
succeeds
to
the
title
of
the
great
here
the
straw
figure
called
the
great
and
placed
on
the
oldest
in
spring
represents
the
spirit
of
the
tree
who
dead
in
winter
revives
when
the
appear
on
the
boughs
thus
the
person
who
plucks
the
first
fruit
from
the
tree
and
thereby
receives
the
name
of
the
great
must
be
regarded
as
a
representative
of
the
primitive
peoples
are
usually
reluctant
to
taste
the
annual
of
any
crop
until
some
ceremony
has
been
performed
which
makes
it
safe
and
pious
for
them
to
do
so
the
reason
of
this
reluctance
appears
to
be
a
belief
that
the
either
belong
to
or
actually
contain
a
divinity
therefore
when
a
man
or
animal
is
seen
boldly
to
appropriate
the
sacred
he
or
it
is
naturally
regarded
as
the
divinity
himself
in
human
or
animal
form
taking
possession
of
his
own
the
time
of
the
athenian
sacrifice
which
fell
about
the
close
of
the
threshing
suggests
that
the
wheat
and
barley
laid
upon
the
altar
were
a
harvest
offering
and
the
sacramental
character
of
the
subsequent
partaking
of
the
flesh
of
the
divine
make
it
parallel
to
the
of
modern
europe
in
which
as
we
have
seen
the
flesh
of
the
animal
who
stands
for
the
is
eaten
by
the
harvesters
again
the
tradition
that
the
sacrifice
was
instituted
in
order
to
put
an
end
to
drought
and
famine
is
in
favour
of
taking
it
as
a
harvest
festival
the
resurrection
of
the
enacted
by
setting
up
the
stuffed
ox
and
yoking
it
to
the
plough
may
be
compared
with
the
resurrection
of
the
in
the
person
of
his
representative
the
wild
man
still
more
clearly
perhaps
does
the
identification
of
the
with
an
ox
come
out
in
the
sacrificial
ritual
which
the
greeks
of
magnesia
on
the
maeander
observed
in
honour
of
zeus
sosipolis
a
god
whose
title
of
sosipolis
saviour
of
the
city
marks
him
as
the
equivalent
of
zeus
polieus
zeus
of
the
city
the
details
of
the
ritual
are
happily
preserved
in
an
inscription
which
records
a
decree
of
the
council
and
of
the
people
for
the
regulation
of
the
whole
proceedings
every
year
at
a
festival
in
the
month
of
heraeon
the
magistrates
bought
the
finest
bull
that
could
be
had
for
money
and
at
the
new
moon
of
the
month
of
cronion
at
the
time
when
the
sowing
was
about
to
begin
they
and
the
priests
dedicated
the
animal
to
zeus
sosipolis
while
solemn
prayers
were
offered
by
the
voice
of
a
sacred
herald
for
the
welfare
of
the
city
of
the
land
and
of
the
people
for
peace
and
wealth
for
the
and
all
other
fruits
and
for
the
cattle
thereafter
the
sacred
animal
was
kept
throughout
the
winter
its
keep
being
undertaken
by
a
contractor
who
was
bound
by
law
to
drive
the
bull
to
the
market
and
there
collect
contributions
for
its
maintenance
from
all
the
hucksters
and
in
particular
from
the
and
a
prospect
was
held
out
to
such
as
contributed
that
it
would
go
well
with
them
finally
after
having
been
thus
maintained
at
the
public
cost
for
some
months
the
bull
was
led
forth
with
great
pomp
and
sacrificed
in
the
on
the
twelfth
day
of
the
month
artemision
which
is
believed
to
have
been
equivalent
to
the
attic
month
of
thargelion
and
to
the
english
month
of
may
the
season
when
the
corn
is
reaped
in
the
greek
lowlands
in
the
procession
which
attended
the
animal
to
the
place
of
sacrifice
the
senators
the
priests
the
magistrates
the
young
people
and
the
victors
in
the
games
all
bore
a
part
and
at
the
head
of
the
procession
were
borne
the
images
of
the
twelve
gods
attired
in
festal
array
while
a
fluteplayer
a
piper
and
a
harper
discoursed
solemn
music
now
in
the
bull
which
was
thus
dedicated
at
the
time
of
sowing
and
kept
at
the
cost
of
the
pious
and
especially
of
to
be
finally
sacrificed
at
harvest
it
is
reasonable
to
see
an
embodiment
of
the
regarded
as
such
the
animal
was
consecrated
when
the
seed
was
committed
to
the
earth
it
was
fed
and
kept
all
the
time
the
corn
was
growing
in
order
that
by
its
beneficent
energies
it
might
foster
that
growth
and
at
last
to
complete
the
parallel
when
the
corn
was
reaped
the
animal
was
slain
the
cutting
of
the
stalks
being
regarded
as
the
death
of
the
similarly
we
have
seen
that
in
the
and
on
the
of
modern
europe
the
is
often
conceived
in
the
form
of
a
bull
an
ox
or
a
calf
which
is
supposed
to
be
killed
at
reaping
or
threshing
and
further
we
saw
that
the
conception
is
sometimes
carried
out
in
practice
by
slaughtering
a
real
ox
or
a
real
calf
on
the
thus
the
parallelism
between
the
ancient
greek
and
the
modern
european
idea
of
the
embodied
in
the
form
of
a
bull
appears
to
be
very
close
on
the
interpretation
which
i
have
adopted
of
the
sacrifices
offered
to
zeus
polieus
and
zeus
sosipolis
the
is
conceived
as
a
male
not
as
a
female
as
zeus
not
as
demeter
or
persephone
in
this
there
is
no
inconsistency
at
the
stage
of
thought
which
the
greeks
had
reached
long
before
the
dawn
of
history
they
supposed
the
processes
of
reproduction
in
nature
to
be
carried
on
by
a
male
and
a
female
principle
in
conjunction
they
did
not
believe
like
some
backward
savages
that
the
female
principle
alone
suffices
for
that
purpose
and
that
the
aid
of
the
male
principle
is
superfluous
hence
as
we
have
seen
they
imagined
that
the
goddesses
of
the
corn
the
mother
demeter
and
the
daughter
persephone
had
each
her
male
partner
with
whom
she
united
for
the
production
of
the
crops
the
partner
of
demeter
was
zeus
the
partner
of
persephone
was
his
brother
pluto
the
subterranean
zeus
as
he
was
called
and
reasons
have
been
shewn
for
thinking
that
the
marriage
of
one
or
other
of
these
divine
pairs
was
solemnised
at
eleusis
as
part
of
the
great
mysteries
in
order
to
promote
the
growth
of
the
corn
the
ox
appears
as
a
representative
of
the
in
other
parts
of
the
world
at
great
bassam
in
guinea
two
oxen
are
slain
annually
to
procure
a
good
harvest
if
the
sacrifice
is
to
be
effectual
it
is
necessary
that
the
oxen
should
weep
so
all
the
women
of
the
village
sit
in
front
of
the
beasts
chanting
the
ox
will
weep
yes
he
will
weep
from
time
to
time
one
of
the
women
walks
round
the
beasts
throwing
manioc
meal
or
palm
wine
upon
them
especially
into
their
eyes
when
tears
roll
down
from
the
eyes
of
the
oxen
the
people
dance
singing
the
ox
weeps
the
ox
weeps
then
two
men
seize
the
tails
of
the
beasts
and
cut
them
off
at
one
blow
it
is
believed
that
a
great
misfortune
will
happen
in
the
course
of
the
year
if
the
tails
are
not
severed
at
one
blow
the
oxen
are
afterwards
killed
and
their
flesh
is
eaten
by
the
chiefs
here
the
tears
of
the
oxen
like
those
of
the
human
victims
amongst
the
khonds
and
the
aztecs
are
probably
a
we
have
already
seen
that
the
virtue
of
the
embodied
in
animal
form
is
sometimes
supposed
to
reside
in
the
tail
and
that
the
last
handful
of
corn
is
sometimes
conceived
as
the
tail
of
the
corn
spirit
in
the
mithraic
religion
this
conception
is
graphically
set
forth
in
some
of
the
numerous
sculptures
which
represent
mithras
kneeling
on
the
back
of
a
bull
and
plunging
a
knife
into
its
flank
for
on
certain
of
these
monuments
the
tail
of
the
bull
ends
in
three
stalks
of
corn
and
in
one
of
them
instead
of
blood
are
seen
issuing
from
the
wound
inflicted
by
the
knife
such
representations
certainly
suggest
that
the
bull
whose
sacrifice
appears
to
have
formed
a
leading
feature
in
the
mithraic
ritual
was
conceived
in
one
at
least
of
its
aspects
as
an
incarnation
of
the
still
more
clearly
does
the
ox
appear
as
a
personification
of
the
in
a
ceremony
which
is
observed
in
all
the
provinces
and
districts
of
china
to
welcome
the
approach
of
spring
on
the
first
day
of
spring
usually
on
the
third
or
fourth
of
february
which
is
also
the
beginning
of
the
chinese
new
year
the
governor
or
prefect
of
the
city
goes
in
procession
to
the
east
gate
of
the
city
and
sacrifices
to
the
divine
husbandman
who
is
represented
with
a
bull
s
head
on
the
body
of
a
man
a
large
effigy
of
an
ox
cow
or
buffalo
has
been
prepared
for
the
occasion
and
stands
outside
of
the
east
gate
with
agricultural
implements
beside
it
the
figure
is
made
of
pieces
of
paper
pasted
on
a
framework
either
by
a
blind
man
or
according
to
the
directions
of
a
necromancer
the
colours
of
the
paper
prognosticate
the
character
of
the
coming
year
if
red
prevails
there
will
be
many
fires
if
white
there
will
be
floods
and
rain
and
so
with
the
other
colours
the
mandarins
walk
slowly
round
the
ox
beating
it
severely
at
each
step
with
rods
of
various
hues
it
is
filled
with
five
kinds
of
grain
which
pour
forth
when
the
effigy
is
broken
by
the
blows
of
the
rods
the
paper
fragments
are
then
set
on
fire
and
a
scramble
takes
place
for
the
burning
fragments
because
the
people
believe
that
whoever
gets
one
of
them
is
sure
to
be
fortunate
throughout
the
year
a
live
buffalo
is
next
killed
and
its
flesh
is
divided
among
the
mandarins
according
to
one
account
the
effigy
of
the
ox
is
made
of
clay
and
after
being
beaten
by
the
governor
is
stoned
by
the
people
till
they
break
it
in
pieces
from
which
they
expect
an
abundant
but
the
ceremony
varies
somewhat
in
the
different
provinces
according
to
another
account
the
effigy
of
the
cow
made
of
earthenware
with
gilded
horns
is
borne
in
procession
and
is
of
such
colossal
dimensions
that
forty
or
fifty
men
can
hardly
carry
it
behind
this
monstrous
cow
walks
a
boy
with
one
foot
shod
and
the
other
bare
personifying
the
genius
of
industry
he
beats
the
effigy
with
a
rod
as
if
to
drive
it
forward
a
great
many
little
clay
cows
are
afterwards
taken
out
of
the
large
one
and
distributed
among
the
people
both
the
big
cow
and
the
little
ones
are
then
broken
in
pieces
and
the
people
take
the
sherds
home
with
them
in
order
to
grind
them
to
powder
and
strew
the
powder
on
their
fields
for
they
think
thus
to
secure
a
plentiful
harvest
in
the
cities
nearest
to
weihaiwei
in
northern
china
the
ceremony
of
the
beginning
of
spring
is
a
moveable
feast
which
falls
usually
in
the
first
moon
the
local
magistrate
and
his
attendants
go
in
procession
to
the
eastern
suburbs
of
the
city
to
meet
the
a
great
pasteboard
effigy
of
an
ox
is
carried
in
the
procession
together
with
another
pasteboard
image
of
a
man
called
who
represents
either
the
typical
or
ploughman
or
the
god
of
on
the
return
of
the
procession
to
the
magistrate
s
court
that
dignitary
himself
and
his
principal
colleagues
beat
and
prod
the
pasteboard
ox
with
wands
after
which
the
effigy
is
burned
along
with
the
image
of
its
attendant
the
colours
and
apparel
of
the
two
effigies
correspond
with
the
forecasts
of
the
chinese
almanack
thus
if
the
head
of
the
ox
is
yellow
the
summer
will
be
very
hot
if
it
is
green
the
spring
will
be
sickly
if
it
is
red
there
will
be
a
drought
if
it
is
black
there
will
be
much
rain
if
it
is
white
there
will
be
high
winds
if
wears
a
hat
the
year
will
be
dry
if
he
is
bareheaded
it
will
be
rainy
and
so
on
with
the
other
articles
of
his
apparel
besides
the
pasteboard
ox
a
miniature
ox
made
of
clay
is
also
supposed
to
be
provided
in
chinese
the
ceremony
is
called
indifferently
beating
the
ox
and
beating
the
spring
which
seems
to
prove
that
the
ox
is
identified
with
the
vernal
energies
of
nature
we
may
suppose
that
originally
the
ox
which
figures
in
the
rite
was
a
living
animal
but
ever
since
the
beginning
of
our
era
when
the
custom
first
appears
in
history
it
has
been
an
effigy
of
or
pasteboard
to
this
day
the
chinese
calendar
devotes
a
page
to
a
picture
of
the
ox
of
spring
with
mang
the
tutelary
genius
of
spring
standing
beside
it
and
grasping
a
with
which
he
is
about
to
beat
the
animal
for
the
purpose
of
stimulating
its
reproductive
virtue
in
one
form
of
this
chinese
custom
the
appears
to
be
plainly
represented
by
the
ox
whose
fragments
may
therefore
be
supposed
to
bring
fertility
with
them
we
may
compare
the
silesian
custom
of
burning
the
effigy
of
death
scrambling
for
the
burning
fragments
and
burying
them
in
the
fields
to
secure
a
good
crop
and
the
florentine
custom
of
sawing
the
old
woman
and
scrambling
for
the
dried
fruits
with
which
she
was
filled
both
these
customs
like
their
chinese
counterpart
are
observed
in
spring
the
practice
of
beating
an
earthenware
or
pasteboard
image
of
an
ox
in
spring
is
not
confined
to
china
proper
but
seems
to
be
widely
spread
in
the
east
of
asia
for
example
it
has
been
recorded
at
kashgar
and
in
annam
thus
a
french
traveller
has
described
how
at
kashgar
on
the
third
of
february
a
mandarin
clad
in
his
finest
robes
and
borne
in
a
magnificent
palanquin
conducted
solemnly
through
the
streets
the
pasteboard
image
of
an
ox
a
sacred
animal
devoted
to
the
deity
of
spring
who
gives
life
to
the
fields
it
is
thus
carried
to
some
distance
outside
of
the
town
on
the
eastern
side
the
official
who
acts
as
pontiff
ceremoniously
offers
food
and
libations
to
it
in
order
to
obtain
a
fruitful
year
and
next
day
it
is
demolished
by
the
lashes
of
a
again
in
annam
every
year
at
the
approach
of
spring
the
department
of
rites
publishes
instructions
to
the
provincial
governors
as
to
the
manner
in
which
the
festival
of
the
inauguration
of
spring
is
to
be
celebrated
among
the
indispensable
features
of
the
festival
are
the
figures
of
an
ox
and
its
warder
made
of
the
attitudes
of
the
two
and
the
colours
to
be
applied
to
them
are
carefully
prescribed
every
year
in
the
chinese
calendar
popular
opinion
attributes
to
the
colour
of
the
ox
and
the
accoutrement
of
its
warder
who
is
called
mang
than
a
certain
influence
on
the
crops
of
the
year
a
green
yellow
and
black
buffalo
prognosticates
an
abundant
harvest
a
red
or
white
buffalo
foretells
wretched
crops
and
great
droughts
or
hurricanes
if
mang
than
is
represented
wearing
a
large
hat
the
year
will
be
rainy
if
on
the
other
hand
he
is
bareheaded
long
barren
droughts
are
to
be
feared
nay
the
public
credulity
goes
so
far
as
to
draw
good
or
evil
omens
from
the
cheerfulness
or
ill
humour
which
may
be
detected
on
the
features
of
the
warder
of
the
ox
having
been
duly
prepared
in
accordance
with
the
directions
of
the
almanack
the
ox
and
its
warder
are
carried
in
procession
followed
by
the
mandarins
and
the
people
to
the
altar
of
spring
which
is
usually
to
be
found
in
every
provincial
capital
there
the
provincial
governor
offers
fruits
flowers
and
incense
to
the
genius
of
spring
and
gold
and
silver
paper
money
are
burnt
on
the
altar
in
profusion
lastly
the
ox
and
his
warder
are
buried
in
a
spot
which
has
been
indicated
by
a
geomancer
it
is
interesting
to
observe
that
the
three
colours
of
the
ox
which
are
taken
to
prognosticate
good
crops
to
wit
green
yellow
and
black
are
precisely
the
colours
which
the
ancients
attributed
to
demeter
the
goddess
of
the
corn
the
great
importance
which
the
chinese
attach
to
the
performance
of
rites
for
the
fertility
of
the
ground
is
proved
by
an
ancient
custom
which
is
or
was
till
lately
observed
every
year
in
spring
on
an
appointed
day
the
emperor
himself
attended
by
the
highest
dignitaries
of
the
state
guides
with
his
own
hand
the
plough
down
several
furrows
and
scatters
the
seed
in
a
sacred
field
or
field
of
god
as
it
is
called
the
produce
of
which
is
afterwards
examined
from
time
to
time
with
anxious
care
by
the
governor
of
peking
who
draws
omens
from
the
appearance
of
the
ears
it
is
a
very
happy
omen
if
he
should
chance
to
find
thirteen
ears
growing
on
one
stalk
to
prepare
himself
for
the
celebration
of
this
solemn
rite
the
emperor
is
expected
to
fast
and
remain
continent
for
three
days
previously
and
the
princes
and
mandarins
who
accompany
him
to
the
field
are
bound
to
observe
similar
restrictions
the
corn
grown
on
the
holy
field
which
has
thus
been
ploughed
by
the
imperial
hands
is
collected
in
yellow
sacks
and
stored
in
a
special
granary
to
be
used
by
the
emperor
in
certain
solemn
sacrifices
which
he
offers
to
the
god
chan
ti
and
to
his
own
ancestors
in
the
provinces
of
china
the
season
of
ploughing
is
similarly
inaugurated
by
the
provincial
governors
as
representatives
of
the
emperor
the
sacred
field
or
field
of
god
in
which
the
emperor
of
china
thus
ceremonially
opens
the
ploughing
for
the
year
and
of
which
the
produce
is
employed
in
sacrifice
reminds
us
of
the
rarian
plain
at
eleusis
in
which
a
sacred
ploughing
similarly
took
place
every
year
and
of
which
the
produce
was
in
like
manner
devoted
to
sacrifice
further
it
recalls
the
little
sacred
on
which
the
kayans
of
central
borneo
inaugurate
the
various
operations
of
the
agricultural
year
by
performing
them
in
miniature
as
i
have
already
pointed
out
all
such
consecrated
enclosures
were
probably
in
origin
what
we
may
call
spiritual
preserves
that
is
patches
of
ground
which
men
set
apart
for
the
exclusive
use
of
the
to
console
him
for
the
depredations
they
committed
on
all
the
rest
of
his
domains
again
the
rule
of
fasting
and
continence
observed
by
the
emperor
of
china
and
his
august
colleagues
before
they
put
their
hands
to
the
plough
resembles
the
similar
customs
of
abstinence
practised
by
many
savages
as
a
preparation
for
engaging
in
the
various
labours
of
the
field
on
the
whole
we
may
perhaps
conclude
that
both
as
a
goat
and
as
a
bull
dionysus
was
essentially
a
god
of
vegetation
the
chinese
and
european
customs
which
i
have
cited
may
perhaps
shed
light
on
the
custom
of
rending
a
live
bull
or
goat
at
the
rites
of
dionysus
the
animal
was
torn
in
fragments
as
the
khond
victim
was
cut
in
pieces
in
order
that
the
worshippers
might
each
secure
a
portion
of
the
and
fertilising
influence
of
the
god
the
flesh
was
eaten
raw
as
a
sacrament
and
we
may
conjecture
that
some
of
it
was
taken
home
to
be
buried
in
the
fields
or
otherwise
employed
so
as
to
convey
to
the
fruits
of
the
earth
the
quickening
influence
of
the
god
of
vegetation
the
resurrection
of
dionysus
related
in
his
myth
may
have
been
enacted
in
his
rites
by
stuffing
and
setting
up
the
slain
ox
as
was
done
at
the
athenian
demeter
the
pig
and
the
horse
passing
next
to
the
demeter
and
remembering
that
in
european
the
pig
is
a
common
embodiment
of
the
we
may
now
ask
whether
the
pig
which
was
so
closely
associated
with
demeter
may
not
have
been
originally
the
goddess
herself
in
animal
form
the
pig
was
sacred
to
her
in
art
she
was
portrayed
carrying
or
accompanied
by
a
pig
and
the
pig
was
regularly
sacrificed
in
her
mysteries
the
reason
assigned
being
that
the
pig
injures
the
corn
and
is
therefore
an
enemy
of
the
goddess
but
after
an
animal
has
been
conceived
as
a
god
or
a
god
as
an
animal
it
sometimes
happens
as
we
have
seen
that
the
god
sloughs
off
his
animal
form
and
becomes
purely
anthropomorphic
and
that
then
the
animal
which
at
first
had
been
slain
in
the
character
of
the
god
comes
to
be
viewed
as
a
victim
offered
to
the
god
on
the
ground
of
its
hostility
to
the
deity
in
short
the
god
is
sacrificed
to
himself
on
the
ground
that
he
is
his
own
enemy
this
happened
to
dionysus
and
it
may
have
happened
to
demeter
also
and
in
fact
the
rites
of
one
of
her
festivals
the
thesmophoria
bear
out
the
view
that
originally
the
pig
was
an
embodiment
of
the
herself
either
demeter
or
her
daughter
and
double
persephone
the
attic
thesmophoria
was
an
autumn
festival
celebrated
by
women
alone
in
october
and
appears
to
have
represented
with
mourning
rites
the
descent
of
persephone
or
demeter
into
the
lower
world
and
with
joy
her
return
from
the
dead
hence
the
name
descent
or
ascent
variously
applied
to
the
first
and
the
name
applied
to
the
third
day
of
the
festival
now
from
an
old
scholium
on
lucian
we
learn
some
details
about
the
mode
of
celebrating
the
thesmophoria
which
shed
important
light
on
the
part
of
the
festival
called
the
descent
or
the
ascent
the
scholiast
tells
us
that
it
was
customary
at
the
thesmophoria
to
throw
pigs
cakes
of
dough
and
branches
of
into
the
chasms
of
demeter
and
persephone
which
appear
to
have
been
sacred
caverns
or
vaults
in
these
caverns
or
vaults
there
were
said
to
be
serpents
which
guarded
the
caverns
and
consumed
most
of
the
flesh
of
the
pigs
and
which
were
thrown
in
at
the
next
annual
festival
decayed
remains
of
the
pigs
the
cakes
and
the
were
fetched
by
women
called
drawers
who
after
observing
rules
of
ceremonial
purity
for
three
days
descended
into
the
caverns
and
frightening
away
the
serpents
by
clapping
their
hands
brought
up
the
remains
and
placed
them
on
the
altar
whoever
got
a
piece
of
the
decayed
flesh
and
cakes
and
sowed
it
with
the
in
his
field
was
believed
to
be
sure
of
a
good
crop
with
the
feeding
of
the
serpents
in
the
vaults
by
the
women
we
may
compare
an
ancient
italian
ritual
at
lanuvium
a
serpent
lived
in
a
sacred
cave
within
a
grove
of
juno
on
certain
appointed
days
a
number
of
holy
maidens
with
their
eyes
bandaged
entered
the
grove
carrying
cakes
of
barley
in
their
hands
led
as
it
was
believed
by
the
divine
spirit
they
walked
straight
to
the
serpent
s
den
and
offered
him
the
cakes
if
they
were
chaste
the
serpent
ate
the
cakes
the
parents
of
the
girls
rejoiced
and
farmers
prognosticated
an
abundant
harvest
but
if
the
girls
were
unchaste
the
serpent
left
the
cakes
untasted
and
ants
came
and
crumbled
the
rejected
viands
and
so
removed
them
bit
by
bit
from
the
sacred
grove
thereby
purifying
the
hallowed
spot
from
the
stain
it
had
contracted
by
the
presence
of
a
defiled
maiden
to
explain
the
rude
and
ancient
ritual
of
the
thesmophoria
the
following
legend
was
told
at
the
moment
when
pluto
carried
off
persephone
a
swineherd
called
eubuleus
chanced
to
be
herding
his
swine
on
the
spot
and
his
herd
was
engulfed
in
the
chasm
down
which
pluto
vanished
with
persephone
accordingly
at
the
thesmophoria
pigs
were
annually
thrown
into
caverns
to
commemorate
the
disappearance
of
the
swine
of
eubuleus
it
follows
from
this
that
the
casting
of
the
pigs
into
the
vaults
at
the
thesmophoria
formed
part
of
the
dramatic
representation
of
persephone
s
descent
into
the
lower
world
and
as
no
image
of
persephone
appears
to
have
been
thrown
in
we
may
infer
that
the
descent
of
the
pigs
was
not
so
much
an
accompaniment
of
her
descent
as
the
descent
itself
in
short
that
the
pigs
were
persephone
afterwards
when
persephone
or
demeter
for
the
two
are
equivalent
took
on
human
form
a
reason
had
to
be
found
for
the
custom
of
throwing
pigs
into
caverns
at
her
festival
and
this
was
done
by
saying
that
when
pluto
carried
off
persephone
there
happened
to
be
some
swine
browsing
near
which
were
swallowed
up
along
with
her
the
story
is
obviously
a
forced
and
awkward
attempt
to
bridge
over
the
gulf
between
the
old
conception
of
the
as
a
pig
and
the
new
conception
of
her
as
an
anthropomorphic
goddess
a
trace
of
the
older
conception
survived
in
the
legend
that
when
the
sad
mother
was
searching
for
traces
of
the
vanished
persephone
the
footprints
of
the
lost
one
were
obliterated
by
the
footprints
of
a
pig
originally
we
may
conjecture
the
footprints
of
the
pig
were
the
footprints
of
persephone
and
of
demeter
herself
a
consciousness
of
the
intimate
connexion
of
the
pig
with
the
corn
lurks
in
the
legend
that
the
swineherd
eubuleus
was
a
brother
of
triptolemus
to
whom
demeter
first
imparted
the
secret
of
the
corn
indeed
according
to
one
version
of
the
story
eubuleus
himself
received
jointly
with
his
brother
triptolemus
the
gift
of
the
corn
from
demeter
as
a
reward
for
revealing
to
her
the
fate
of
persephone
further
it
is
to
be
noted
that
at
the
thesmophoria
the
women
appear
to
have
eaten
swine
s
flesh
the
meal
if
i
am
right
must
have
been
a
solemn
sacrament
or
communion
the
worshippers
partaking
of
the
body
of
the
god
as
thus
explained
the
thesmophoria
has
its
analogies
in
the
of
northern
europe
which
have
been
already
described
just
as
at
the
autumn
festival
in
honour
of
the
s
flesh
was
partly
eaten
partly
kept
in
caverns
till
the
following
year
when
it
was
taken
up
to
be
sown
with
the
in
the
fields
for
the
purpose
of
securing
a
good
crop
so
in
the
neighbourhood
of
grenoble
the
goat
killed
on
the
is
partly
eaten
at
the
partly
pickled
and
kept
till
the
next
harvest
so
at
pouilly
the
ox
killed
on
the
is
partly
eaten
by
the
harvesters
partly
pickled
and
kept
till
the
first
day
of
sowing
in
spring
probably
to
be
then
mixed
with
the
seed
or
eaten
by
the
ploughmen
or
both
so
at
udvarhely
the
feathers
of
the
cock
which
is
killed
in
the
last
sheaf
at
harvest
are
kept
till
spring
and
then
sown
with
the
seed
on
the
field
so
in
hesse
and
meiningen
the
flesh
of
pigs
is
eaten
on
ash
wednesday
or
candlemas
and
the
bones
are
kept
till
when
they
are
put
into
the
field
sown
or
mixed
with
the
seed
in
the
bag
so
lastly
the
corn
from
the
last
sheaf
is
kept
till
christmas
made
into
the
yule
boar
and
afterwards
broken
and
mixed
with
the
at
sowing
in
spring
thus
to
put
it
generally
the
is
killed
in
animal
form
in
autumn
part
of
his
flesh
is
eaten
as
a
sacrament
by
his
worshippers
and
part
of
it
is
kept
till
next
or
harvest
as
a
pledge
and
security
for
the
continuance
or
renewal
of
the
s
energies
whether
in
the
interval
between
autumn
and
spring
he
is
conceived
as
dead
or
whether
like
the
ox
in
the
he
is
supposed
to
come
to
life
again
immediately
after
being
killed
is
not
clear
at
the
thesmophoria
according
to
clement
and
pausanias
as
emended
by
lobeck
the
pigs
were
thrown
in
alive
and
were
supposed
to
reappear
at
the
festival
of
the
following
year
here
therefore
if
we
accept
lobeck
s
emendations
the
is
conceived
as
alive
throughout
the
year
he
lives
and
works
under
ground
but
is
brought
up
each
autumn
to
be
renewed
and
then
replaced
in
his
subterranean
abode
if
persons
of
fastidious
taste
should
object
that
the
greeks
never
could
have
conceived
demeter
and
persephone
to
be
embodied
in
the
form
of
pigs
it
may
be
answered
that
in
the
cave
of
phigalia
in
arcadia
the
black
demeter
was
portrayed
with
the
head
and
mane
of
a
horse
on
the
body
of
a
woman
between
the
portrait
of
a
goddess
as
a
pig
and
the
portrait
of
her
as
a
woman
with
a
horse
s
head
there
is
little
to
choose
in
respect
of
barbarism
the
legend
told
of
the
phigalian
demeter
indicates
that
the
horse
was
one
of
the
animal
forms
assumed
in
ancient
greece
as
in
modern
europe
by
the
it
was
said
that
in
her
search
for
her
daughter
demeter
assumed
the
form
of
a
mare
to
escape
the
addresses
of
poseidon
and
that
offended
at
his
importunity
she
withdrew
in
dudgeon
to
a
cave
not
far
from
phigalia
in
the
highlands
of
western
arcadia
the
very
cavern
now
turned
into
a
little
christian
chapel
with
its
holy
pictures
is
still
shewn
to
the
curious
traveller
far
down
the
side
of
that
profound
ravine
through
which
the
brawling
neda
winds
under
overhanging
woods
to
the
sea
there
robed
in
black
she
tarried
so
long
that
the
fruits
of
the
earth
were
perishing
and
mankind
would
have
died
of
famine
if
pan
had
not
soothed
the
angry
goddess
and
persuaded
her
to
quit
the
cave
in
memory
of
this
event
the
phigalians
set
up
an
image
of
the
black
demeter
in
the
cave
it
represented
a
woman
dressed
in
a
long
robe
with
the
head
and
mane
of
a
horse
the
black
demeter
in
whose
absence
the
fruits
of
the
earth
perish
is
plainly
a
mythical
expression
for
the
bare
wintry
earth
stripped
of
its
summer
mantle
of
green
attis
adonis
and
the
pig
passing
now
to
attis
and
adonis
we
may
note
a
few
facts
which
seem
to
shew
that
these
deities
of
vegetation
had
also
like
other
deities
of
the
same
class
their
animal
embodiments
the
worshippers
of
attis
abstained
from
eating
the
flesh
of
swine
this
appears
to
indicate
that
the
pig
was
regarded
as
an
embodiment
of
attis
and
the
legend
that
attis
was
killed
by
a
boar
points
in
the
same
direction
for
after
the
examples
of
the
goat
dionysus
and
the
pig
demeter
it
may
almost
be
laid
down
as
a
rule
that
an
animal
which
is
said
to
have
injured
a
god
was
originally
the
god
himself
perhaps
the
cry
of
hyes
attes
hyes
attes
which
was
raised
by
the
worshippers
of
attis
may
be
neither
more
nor
less
than
pig
attis
pig
attis
being
possibly
a
phrygian
form
of
the
greek
a
in
regard
to
adonis
his
connexion
with
the
boar
was
not
always
explained
by
the
story
that
he
had
been
killed
by
the
animal
according
to
another
story
a
boar
rent
with
his
tusk
the
bark
of
the
tree
in
which
the
infant
adonis
was
born
according
to
yet
another
story
he
perished
at
the
hands
of
hephaestus
on
mount
lebanon
while
he
was
hunting
wild
boars
these
variations
in
the
legend
serve
to
shew
that
while
the
connexion
of
the
boar
with
adonis
was
certain
the
reason
of
the
connexion
was
not
understood
and
that
consequently
different
stories
were
devised
to
explain
it
certainly
the
pig
ranked
as
a
sacred
animal
among
the
syrians
at
the
great
religious
metropolis
of
hierapolis
on
the
euphrates
pigs
were
neither
sacrificed
nor
eaten
and
if
a
man
touched
a
pig
he
was
unclean
for
the
rest
of
the
day
some
people
said
this
was
because
the
pigs
were
unclean
others
said
it
was
because
the
pigs
were
sacred
this
difference
of
opinion
points
to
a
hazy
state
of
religious
thought
in
which
the
ideas
of
sanctity
and
uncleanness
are
not
yet
sharply
distinguished
both
being
blent
in
a
sort
of
vaporous
solution
to
which
we
give
the
name
of
taboo
it
is
quite
consistent
with
this
that
the
pig
should
have
been
held
to
be
an
embodiment
of
the
divine
adonis
and
the
analogies
of
dionysus
and
demeter
make
it
probable
that
the
story
of
the
hostility
of
the
animal
to
the
god
was
only
a
late
misapprehension
of
the
old
view
of
the
god
as
embodied
in
a
pig
the
rule
that
pigs
were
not
sacrificed
or
eaten
by
worshippers
of
attis
and
presumably
of
adonis
does
not
exclude
the
possibility
that
in
these
rituals
the
pig
was
slain
on
solemn
occasions
as
a
representative
of
the
god
and
consumed
sacramentally
by
the
worshippers
indeed
the
sacramental
killing
and
eating
of
an
animal
implies
that
the
animal
is
sacred
and
that
as
a
general
rule
it
is
spared
the
attitude
of
the
jews
to
the
pig
was
as
ambiguous
as
that
of
the
heathen
syrians
towards
the
same
animal
the
greeks
could
not
decide
whether
the
jews
worshipped
swine
or
abominated
them
on
the
one
hand
they
might
not
eat
swine
but
on
the
other
hand
they
might
not
kill
them
and
if
the
former
rule
speaks
for
the
uncleanness
the
latter
speaks
still
more
strongly
for
the
sanctity
of
the
animal
for
whereas
both
rules
may
and
one
rule
must
be
explained
on
the
supposition
that
the
pig
was
sacred
neither
rule
must
and
one
rule
can
not
be
explained
on
the
supposition
that
the
pig
was
unclean
if
therefore
we
prefer
the
former
supposition
we
must
conclude
that
originally
at
least
the
pig
was
revered
rather
than
abhorred
by
the
israelites
we
are
confirmed
in
this
opinion
by
observing
that
down
to
the
time
of
isaiah
some
of
the
jews
used
to
meet
secretly
in
gardens
to
eat
the
flesh
of
swine
and
mice
as
a
religious
rite
doubtless
this
was
a
very
ancient
ceremony
dating
from
a
time
when
both
the
pig
and
the
mouse
were
venerated
as
divine
and
when
their
flesh
was
partaken
of
sacramentally
on
rare
and
solemn
occasions
as
the
body
and
blood
of
gods
and
in
general
it
may
be
said
that
all
unclean
animals
were
originally
sacred
the
reason
for
not
eating
them
was
that
they
were
divine
osiris
the
pig
and
the
bull
in
ancient
egypt
within
historical
times
the
pig
occupied
the
same
dubious
position
as
in
syria
and
palestine
though
at
first
sight
its
uncleanness
is
more
prominent
than
its
sanctity
the
egyptians
are
generally
said
by
greek
writers
to
have
abhorred
the
pig
as
a
foul
and
loathsome
animal
if
a
man
so
much
as
touched
a
pig
in
passing
he
stepped
into
the
river
with
all
his
clothes
on
to
wash
off
the
taint
to
drink
pig
s
milk
was
believed
to
cause
leprosy
to
the
drinker
swineherds
though
natives
of
egypt
were
forbidden
to
enter
any
temple
and
they
were
the
only
men
who
were
thus
excluded
no
one
would
give
his
daughter
in
marriage
to
a
swineherd
or
marry
a
swineherd
s
daughter
the
swineherds
married
among
themselves
yet
once
a
year
the
egyptians
sacrificed
pigs
to
the
moon
and
to
osiris
and
not
only
sacrificed
them
but
ate
of
their
flesh
though
on
any
other
day
of
the
year
they
would
neither
sacrifice
them
nor
taste
of
their
flesh
those
who
were
too
poor
to
offer
a
pig
on
this
day
baked
cakes
of
dough
and
offered
them
instead
this
can
hardly
be
explained
except
by
the
supposition
that
the
pig
was
a
sacred
animal
which
was
eaten
sacramentally
by
his
worshippers
once
a
year
the
view
that
in
egypt
the
pig
was
sacred
is
borne
out
by
the
very
facts
which
to
moderns
might
seem
to
prove
the
contrary
thus
the
egyptians
thought
as
we
have
seen
that
to
drink
pig
s
milk
produced
leprosy
but
exactly
analogous
views
are
held
by
savages
about
the
animals
and
plants
which
they
deem
most
sacred
thus
in
the
island
of
wetar
between
new
guinea
and
celebes
people
believe
themselves
to
be
variously
descended
from
wild
pigs
serpents
crocodiles
turtles
dogs
and
eels
a
man
may
not
eat
an
animal
of
the
kind
from
which
he
is
descended
if
he
does
so
he
will
become
a
leper
and
go
mad
amongst
the
omaha
indians
of
north
america
men
whose
totem
is
the
elk
believe
that
if
they
ate
the
flesh
of
the
male
elk
they
would
break
out
in
boils
and
white
spots
in
different
parts
of
their
bodies
in
the
same
tribe
men
whose
totem
is
the
red
maize
think
that
if
they
ate
red
maize
they
would
have
running
sores
all
round
their
mouths
the
bush
negroes
of
surinam
who
practise
totemism
believe
that
if
they
ate
the
an
animal
like
a
pig
it
would
give
them
leprosy
perhaps
the
is
one
of
their
totems
the
syrians
in
antiquity
who
esteemed
fish
sacred
thought
that
if
they
ate
fish
their
bodies
would
break
out
in
ulcers
and
their
feet
and
stomach
would
swell
up
the
tribes
of
central
angoniland
in
british
central
africa
believe
that
if
a
person
eats
his
totemic
animal
his
body
will
break
out
in
spots
the
cure
for
this
eruption
of
the
skin
is
to
bathe
the
body
in
a
decoction
made
from
the
bone
of
the
animal
the
eating
of
which
caused
the
malady
the
wagogo
of
german
east
africa
imagine
that
the
sin
of
eating
the
totemic
animal
is
visited
not
on
the
sinner
himself
but
on
his
innocent
kinsfolk
thus
when
they
see
a
child
with
a
scald
head
they
say
at
once
that
its
father
has
been
eating
his
totem
and
that
is
why
the
poor
child
has
scabs
on
its
pate
among
the
wahehe
another
tribe
of
german
east
africa
a
man
who
suffers
from
scab
or
other
skin
disease
will
often
set
the
trouble
down
to
his
having
unwittingly
partaken
of
his
totemic
animal
similarly
among
the
waheia
another
tribe
of
the
same
region
if
a
man
kills
or
eats
the
totemic
animal
of
his
clan
he
is
supposed
to
suffer
from
an
eruption
of
the
skin
in
like
manner
the
bantu
tribes
of
kavirondo
in
central
africa
hold
that
the
eating
of
the
totem
produces
a
severe
cutaneous
eruption
which
can
however
be
cured
by
mixing
an
extract
of
certain
herbs
with
the
fat
of
a
black
ox
and
rubbing
the
body
of
the
sufferer
all
over
with
the
mixture
the
chasas
of
orissa
believe
that
if
they
were
to
injure
their
totemic
animal
they
would
be
attacked
by
leprosy
and
their
line
would
die
out
these
examples
prove
that
the
eating
of
a
sacred
animal
is
often
believed
to
produce
leprosy
or
other
so
far
therefore
they
support
the
view
that
the
pig
must
have
been
sacred
in
egypt
since
the
effect
of
drinking
its
milk
was
believed
to
be
leprosy
such
fancies
may
perhaps
have
been
sometimes
suggested
by
the
observation
that
the
eating
of
flesh
to
which
some
savages
are
addicted
is
apt
to
be
followed
by
eruptions
on
the
skin
indeed
many
modern
authorities
attribute
leprosy
to
this
cause
particularly
to
the
eating
of
half
rotten
fish
it
seems
not
impossible
that
the
abhorrence
which
the
hebrews
entertained
of
leprosy
and
the
pains
which
they
took
to
seclude
lepers
from
the
community
may
have
been
based
on
religious
as
well
as
on
purely
sanitary
grounds
they
may
have
imagined
that
the
disfigurement
of
the
sufferers
was
a
penalty
which
they
had
incurred
by
some
infraction
of
taboo
certainly
we
read
in
the
old
testament
of
cases
of
leprosy
which
the
historian
regarded
as
the
direct
consequence
of
sin
again
the
rule
that
after
touching
a
pig
a
man
had
to
wash
himself
and
his
clothes
also
favours
the
view
of
the
sanctity
of
the
pig
for
it
is
a
common
belief
that
the
effect
of
contact
with
a
sacred
object
must
be
removed
by
washing
or
otherwise
before
a
man
is
free
to
mingle
with
his
fellows
thus
the
jews
wash
their
hands
after
reading
the
sacred
scriptures
before
coming
forth
from
the
tabernacle
after
the
the
high
priest
had
to
wash
himself
and
put
off
the
garments
which
he
had
worn
in
the
holy
place
it
was
a
rule
of
greek
ritual
that
in
offering
an
expiatory
sacrifice
the
sacrificer
should
not
touch
the
sacrifice
and
that
after
the
offering
was
made
he
must
wash
his
body
and
his
clothes
in
a
river
or
spring
before
he
could
enter
a
city
or
his
own
house
the
parjas
a
small
tribe
of
the
central
provinces
in
india
are
divided
into
clans
which
have
for
their
respective
totems
the
tiger
the
tortoise
the
goat
a
big
lizard
a
dove
and
so
on
if
a
man
accidentally
kills
his
totemic
animal
the
earthen
of
his
household
are
thrown
away
the
clothes
are
washed
and
the
house
is
purified
with
water
in
which
the
bark
of
the
mango
or
tree
has
been
steeped
this
is
in
sign
of
mourning
as
it
is
thought
that
such
an
act
will
bring
if
a
chadwar
of
the
central
provinces
who
has
the
pig
for
his
totem
should
even
see
a
pig
killed
by
somebody
else
he
will
throw
away
the
household
crockery
and
clean
the
house
as
if
on
the
death
of
a
member
of
his
family
the
polynesians
felt
strongly
the
need
of
ridding
themselves
of
the
sacred
contagion
if
it
may
be
so
called
which
they
caught
by
touching
sacred
objects
various
ceremonies
were
performed
for
the
purpose
of
removing
this
contagion
we
have
seen
for
example
how
in
tonga
a
man
who
happened
to
touch
a
sacred
chief
or
anything
personally
belonging
to
him
had
to
perform
a
certain
ceremony
before
he
could
feed
himself
with
his
hands
otherwise
it
was
believed
that
he
would
swell
up
and
die
or
at
least
be
afflicted
with
scrofula
or
some
other
disease
we
have
seen
too
what
fatal
effects
are
supposed
to
follow
and
do
actually
follow
from
contact
with
a
sacred
object
in
new
zealand
in
short
primitive
man
believes
that
what
is
sacred
is
dangerous
it
is
pervaded
by
a
sort
of
electrical
sanctity
which
communicates
a
shock
to
even
if
it
does
not
kill
whatever
comes
in
contact
with
it
hence
the
savage
is
unwilling
to
touch
or
even
to
see
that
which
he
deems
peculiarly
holy
thus
bechuanas
of
the
crocodile
clan
think
it
hateful
and
unlucky
to
meet
or
see
a
crocodile
the
sight
is
thought
to
cause
inflammation
of
the
eyes
yet
the
crocodile
is
their
most
sacred
object
they
call
it
their
father
swear
by
it
and
celebrate
it
in
their
festivals
the
goat
is
the
sacred
animal
of
the
madenassana
bushmen
yet
to
look
upon
it
would
be
to
render
the
man
for
the
time
impure
as
well
as
to
cause
him
undefined
the
elk
clan
among
the
omaha
indians
believe
that
even
to
touch
the
male
elk
would
be
followed
by
an
eruption
of
boils
and
white
spots
on
the
body
members
of
the
reptile
clan
in
the
same
tribe
think
that
if
one
of
them
touches
or
smells
a
snake
it
will
make
his
hair
white
in
samoa
people
whose
god
was
a
butterfly
believed
that
if
they
caught
a
butterfly
it
would
strike
them
dead
again
in
samoa
the
leaves
of
the
were
commonly
used
as
plates
for
handing
food
but
if
any
member
of
the
wild
pigeon
family
had
used
banana
leaves
for
this
purpose
it
was
supposed
that
he
would
suffer
from
rheumatic
swellings
or
an
eruption
all
over
the
body
like
the
mori
clan
of
the
bhils
in
central
india
worship
the
peacock
as
their
totem
and
make
offerings
of
grain
to
it
yet
members
of
the
clan
believe
that
were
they
even
to
set
foot
on
the
tracks
of
a
peacock
they
would
afterwards
suffer
from
some
disease
and
if
a
woman
sees
a
peacock
she
must
veil
her
face
and
look
away
thus
the
primitive
mind
seems
to
conceive
of
holiness
as
a
sort
of
dangerous
virus
which
a
prudent
man
will
shun
as
far
as
possible
and
of
which
if
he
should
chance
to
be
infected
by
it
he
will
carefully
disinfect
himself
by
some
form
of
ceremonial
purification
in
the
light
of
these
parallels
the
beliefs
and
customs
of
the
egyptians
touching
the
pig
are
probably
to
be
explained
as
based
upon
an
opinion
of
the
extreme
sanctity
rather
than
of
the
extreme
uncleanness
of
the
animal
or
rather
to
put
it
more
correctly
they
imply
that
the
animal
was
looked
on
not
simply
as
a
filthy
and
disgusting
creature
but
as
a
being
endowed
with
high
supernatural
powers
and
that
as
such
it
was
regarded
with
that
primitive
sentiment
of
religious
awe
and
fear
in
which
the
feelings
of
reverence
and
abhorrence
are
almost
equally
blended
the
ancients
themselves
seem
to
have
been
aware
that
there
was
another
side
to
the
horror
with
which
swine
seemed
to
inspire
the
egyptians
for
the
greek
astronomer
and
mathematician
eudoxus
who
resided
fourteen
months
in
egypt
and
conversed
with
the
priests
was
of
opinion
that
the
egyptians
spared
the
pig
not
out
of
abhorrence
but
from
a
regard
to
its
utility
in
agriculture
for
according
to
him
when
the
nile
had
subsided
herds
of
swine
were
turned
loose
over
the
fields
to
tread
the
seed
down
into
the
moist
earth
but
when
a
being
is
thus
the
object
of
mixed
and
implicitly
contradictory
feelings
he
may
be
said
to
occupy
a
position
of
unstable
equilibrium
in
course
of
time
one
of
the
contradictory
feelings
is
likely
to
prevail
over
the
other
and
according
as
the
feeling
which
finally
predominates
is
that
of
reverence
or
abhorrence
the
being
who
is
the
object
of
it
will
rise
into
a
god
or
sink
into
a
devil
the
latter
on
the
whole
was
the
fate
of
the
pig
in
egypt
for
in
historical
times
the
fear
and
horror
of
the
pig
seem
certainly
to
have
outweighed
the
reverence
and
worship
of
which
he
may
once
have
been
the
object
and
of
which
even
in
his
fallen
state
he
never
quite
lost
trace
he
came
to
be
looked
on
as
an
embodiment
of
set
or
typhon
the
egyptian
devil
and
enemy
of
osiris
for
it
was
in
the
shape
of
a
black
pig
that
typhon
injured
the
eye
of
the
god
horus
who
burned
him
and
instituted
the
sacrifice
of
the
pig
the
ra
having
declared
the
beast
abominable
again
the
story
that
typhon
was
hunting
a
boar
when
he
discovered
and
mangled
the
body
of
osiris
and
that
this
was
the
reason
why
pigs
were
sacrificed
once
a
year
is
clearly
a
modernised
version
of
an
older
story
that
osiris
like
adonis
and
attis
was
slain
or
mangled
by
a
boar
or
by
typhon
in
the
form
of
a
boar
thus
the
annual
sacrifice
of
a
pig
to
osiris
might
naturally
be
interpreted
as
vengeance
inflicted
on
the
hostile
animal
that
had
slain
or
mangled
the
god
but
in
the
first
place
when
an
animal
is
thus
killed
as
a
solemn
sacrifice
once
and
once
only
in
the
year
it
generally
or
always
means
that
the
animal
is
divine
that
he
is
spared
and
respected
the
rest
of
the
year
as
a
god
and
slain
when
he
is
slain
also
in
the
character
of
a
god
in
the
second
place
the
examples
of
dionysus
and
demeter
if
not
of
attis
and
adonis
have
taught
us
that
the
animal
which
is
sacrificed
to
a
god
on
the
ground
that
he
is
the
god
s
enemy
may
have
been
and
probably
was
originally
the
god
himself
therefore
the
annual
sacrifice
of
a
pig
to
osiris
coupled
with
the
alleged
hostility
of
the
animal
to
the
god
tends
to
shew
first
that
originally
the
pig
was
a
god
and
second
that
he
was
osiris
at
a
later
age
when
osiris
became
anthropomorphic
and
his
original
relation
to
the
pig
had
been
forgotten
the
animal
was
first
distinguished
from
him
and
afterwards
opposed
as
an
enemy
to
him
by
mythologists
who
could
think
of
no
reason
for
killing
a
beast
in
connexion
with
the
worship
of
a
god
except
that
the
beast
was
the
god
s
enemy
or
as
plutarch
puts
it
not
that
which
is
dear
to
the
gods
but
that
which
is
the
contrary
is
fit
to
be
sacrificed
at
this
later
stage
the
havoc
which
a
wild
boar
notoriously
makes
amongst
the
corn
would
supply
a
plausible
reason
for
regarding
him
as
the
foe
of
the
though
originally
if
i
am
right
the
very
freedom
with
which
the
boar
ranged
at
will
through
the
corn
led
people
to
identify
him
with
the
to
whom
he
was
afterwards
opposed
as
an
enemy
as
the
depredations
committed
by
wild
swine
on
the
growing
crops
in
countries
where
these
creatures
abound
are
necessarily
unfamiliar
to
most
english
readers
it
may
be
well
to
illustrate
them
by
examples
thus
for
instance
in
palestine
the
wild
boar
is
eagerly
chased
and
destroyed
on
account
of
the
frightful
ravages
it
makes
among
the
crops
not
only
does
it
devour
any
fruits
within
reach
but
in
a
single
night
a
party
of
wild
boars
will
uproot
a
whole
field
and
destroy
the
husbandman
s
hopes
for
the
year
the
places
they
love
to
frequent
are
the
reedy
marshes
and
thickets
by
rivers
and
lakes
and
they
swarm
in
the
thickets
all
along
the
banks
of
the
jordan
from
jericho
to
the
lake
of
gennesaret
from
these
fastnesses
whence
neither
dog
nor
man
can
dislodge
them
they
make
nightly
forays
upon
the
and
of
the
villagers
returning
at
daybreak
to
their
coverts
about
jericho
they
are
especially
destructive
and
when
the
barley
crop
is
ripening
the
husbandmen
have
to
keep
nightly
watch
to
drive
them
away
their
presence
can
always
be
detected
by
the
crashing
noise
they
make
in
forcing
their
way
through
the
thickets
when
the
men
fire
guided
by
the
wild
pigs
are
the
special
enemies
of
the
crops
in
south
africa
the
fences
constructed
by
the
zulus
round
their
gardens
are
mainly
designed
to
guard
against
the
devastating
depredations
of
these
brutes
though
porcupines
baboons
hippopotamuses
and
elephants
also
make
havoc
of
the
ripe
grain
sometimes
small
huts
are
erected
on
platforms
in
the
gardens
and
in
these
huts
watchers
are
set
to
scare
away
the
nocturnal
invaders
so
in
british
central
africa
sentinels
are
posted
day
and
night
in
huts
raised
on
platforms
to
protect
the
maize
fields
from
the
inroads
of
baboons
and
of
wild
pigs
which
are
still
more
destructive
than
the
baboons
for
they
grub
up
the
plants
as
well
as
devour
the
grain
and
the
watchers
drum
continually
on
any
metal
they
have
at
hand
to
keep
the
marauders
at
bay
in
the
island
of
nias
whole
fields
are
sometimes
trampled
down
by
these
pests
between
sunset
and
sunrise
often
the
stillness
of
the
serene
equatorial
night
is
broken
by
the
strident
cries
of
the
watchers
of
the
fields
the
sound
goes
echoing
through
the
wooded
valleys
for
a
long
time
and
here
and
there
a
dull
grunting
tells
that
the
efforts
of
the
sentinels
have
not
been
in
vain
in
northern
luzon
of
the
philippine
archipelago
the
are
similarly
exposed
to
the
depredations
of
wild
hogs
and
watchers
remain
on
guard
day
and
night
in
outlooks
sometimes
in
commodious
structures
of
stone
erected
for
the
purpose
who
burn
fires
at
night
to
frighten
the
animals
away
at
the
beginning
of
their
annual
agricultural
labours
the
banars
of
cambodia
pray
to
that
he
would
be
pleased
to
give
them
plenty
of
rice
and
to
prevent
the
wild
boars
from
eating
it
up
in
a
district
of
sumatra
the
worst
enemies
of
the
rice
crops
are
wild
swine
and
field
mice
the
whole
of
the
harvest
is
sometimes
destroyed
by
their
inroads
among
the
kai
of
german
new
guinea
people
who
are
engaged
in
the
labour
of
the
fields
will
on
no
account
eat
pork
the
reason
is
that
pigs
both
wild
and
tame
are
the
most
dangerous
foes
of
the
crops
therefore
it
seems
clear
to
the
mind
of
the
kai
that
if
a
field
labourer
were
to
eat
pork
the
flesh
of
the
dead
pig
in
his
stomach
would
attract
the
living
pigs
into
the
field
perhaps
this
superstition
based
on
the
principle
of
sympathetic
magic
may
explain
the
aversion
to
pork
which
was
entertained
by
some
of
the
agricultural
peoples
of
the
eastern
mediterranean
in
antiquity
to
people
thus
familiarised
with
the
ravages
of
wild
boars
among
the
ripe
crops
the
idea
might
naturally
present
itself
that
the
animal
is
either
the
enemy
of
the
or
perhaps
the
himself
come
in
person
to
enjoy
his
own
despite
all
the
efforts
of
mankind
to
keep
him
out
of
his
rights
hence
we
can
understand
how
an
agricultural
people
like
the
ancient
egyptians
may
have
identified
the
wild
boar
either
with
their
osiris
or
with
his
enemy
typhon
the
view
which
identifies
the
pig
with
osiris
derives
not
a
little
support
from
the
sacrifice
of
pigs
to
him
on
the
very
day
on
which
according
to
tradition
osiris
himself
was
killed
for
thus
the
killing
of
the
pig
was
the
annual
representation
of
the
killing
of
osiris
just
as
the
throwing
of
the
pigs
into
the
caverns
at
the
thesmophoria
was
an
annual
representation
of
the
descent
of
persephone
into
the
lower
world
and
both
customs
are
parallel
to
the
european
practice
of
killing
a
goat
cock
and
so
forth
at
harvest
as
a
representative
of
the
again
the
theory
that
the
pig
originally
osiris
himself
afterwards
came
to
be
regarded
as
an
embodiment
of
his
enemy
typhon
is
supported
by
the
similar
relation
of
men
and
red
oxen
to
typhon
for
in
regard
to
the
men
who
were
burned
and
whose
ashes
were
scattered
with
we
have
seen
fair
grounds
for
believing
that
originally
like
the
puppies
killed
at
rome
in
spring
they
were
representatives
of
the
himself
that
is
of
osiris
and
were
slain
for
the
express
purpose
of
making
the
corn
turn
red
or
golden
yet
at
a
later
time
these
men
were
explained
to
be
representatives
not
of
osiris
but
of
his
enemy
typhon
and
the
killing
of
them
was
regarded
as
an
act
of
vengeance
inflicted
on
the
enemy
of
the
god
similarly
the
red
oxen
sacrificed
by
the
egyptians
were
said
to
be
offered
on
the
ground
of
their
resemblance
to
typhon
though
it
is
more
likely
that
originally
they
were
slain
on
the
ground
of
their
resemblance
to
the
osiris
we
have
seen
that
the
ox
is
a
common
representative
of
the
and
is
slain
as
such
on
the
osiris
was
regularly
identified
with
the
bull
apis
of
memphis
and
the
bull
mnevis
of
heliopolis
but
it
is
hard
to
say
whether
these
bulls
were
embodiments
of
him
as
the
as
the
red
oxen
appear
to
have
been
or
whether
they
were
not
in
origin
entirely
distinct
deities
who
came
to
be
fused
with
osiris
at
a
later
time
the
universality
of
the
worship
of
these
two
bulls
seems
to
put
them
on
a
different
footing
from
the
ordinary
sacred
animals
whose
worships
were
purely
local
hence
if
the
latter
were
evolved
from
totems
as
they
may
have
been
some
other
origin
would
have
to
be
found
for
the
worship
of
apis
and
mnevis
if
these
bulls
were
not
originally
embodiments
of
the
osiris
they
may
possibly
be
descendants
of
the
sacred
cattle
worshipped
by
a
pastoral
people
if
this
were
so
ancient
egypt
would
exhibit
a
stratification
of
three
great
types
of
religion
or
superstition
corresponding
to
three
great
stages
of
society
totemism
which
may
be
roughly
described
as
a
species
of
superstitious
respect
paid
to
wild
animals
and
plants
by
many
tribes
in
the
hunting
stage
of
society
would
be
represented
by
the
worship
of
the
local
sacred
animals
the
worship
of
cattle
which
belongs
to
society
in
the
pastoral
stage
would
be
represented
by
the
cults
of
apis
and
mnevis
and
the
worship
of
cultivated
plants
which
is
peculiar
to
society
in
the
agricultural
stage
would
be
represented
by
the
religion
of
osiris
and
isis
the
egyptian
reverence
for
cows
which
were
never
killed
might
belong
either
to
the
second
or
the
third
of
these
stages
the
consecration
of
cows
to
isis
who
was
portrayed
with
cow
s
horns
and
may
have
been
supposed
to
be
incarnate
in
the
animals
would
indicate
that
they
like
the
red
oxen
were
embodiments
of
the
however
this
identification
of
isis
with
the
cow
like
that
of
osiris
with
the
bulls
apis
and
mnevis
may
be
only
an
effect
of
syncretism
but
whatever
the
original
relation
of
apis
to
osiris
may
have
been
there
is
one
fact
about
the
former
which
ought
not
to
be
passed
over
in
a
disquisition
on
the
custom
of
killing
a
god
although
the
bull
apis
was
worshipped
as
a
god
with
much
pomp
and
profound
reverence
he
was
not
suffered
to
live
beyond
a
certain
length
of
time
which
was
prescribed
by
the
sacred
books
and
on
the
expiry
of
which
he
was
drowned
in
a
holy
spring
the
limit
according
to
plutarch
was
years
but
it
can
not
always
have
been
enforced
for
the
tombs
of
the
apis
bulls
have
been
discovered
in
modern
times
and
from
the
inscriptions
on
them
it
appears
that
in
the
dynasty
two
of
the
holy
steers
lived
more
than
years
to
prevent
misunderstandings
it
may
be
well
to
add
that
what
i
have
just
said
as
to
the
stratification
of
three
great
types
of
religion
or
superstition
corresponding
to
three
great
types
of
society
is
not
meant
to
sketch
even
in
outline
the
evolution
of
religion
as
a
whole
i
by
no
means
wish
to
suggest
that
the
reverence
for
wild
animals
and
plants
the
reverence
for
domestic
cattle
and
the
reverence
for
cultivated
plants
are
the
only
forms
of
religion
or
superstition
which
prevail
at
the
corresponding
stages
of
social
development
all
that
i
desire
to
convey
is
that
they
are
characteristic
of
these
stages
respectively
the
elements
which
make
up
any
religious
system
are
far
too
numerous
and
their
interaction
far
too
complex
to
be
adequately
summed
up
in
a
few
simple
formulas
to
mention
only
a
single
factor
of
which
i
have
taken
no
account
in
indicating
roughly
a
certain
correspondence
between
the
strata
of
religion
and
of
society
the
fear
of
the
spirits
of
the
dead
appears
to
have
been
one
of
the
most
powerful
factors
perhaps
indeed
the
most
powerful
of
all
in
shaping
the
course
of
religious
evolution
at
every
stage
of
social
development
from
the
lowest
to
the
highest
and
for
that
very
reason
it
is
not
specially
characteristic
of
any
one
form
of
society
and
the
three
types
of
religion
or
superstition
which
i
have
selected
as
characteristic
of
three
stages
of
society
are
far
from
being
strictly
limited
each
to
its
corresponding
step
in
the
social
ladder
for
example
although
totemism
or
a
particular
species
of
reverence
paid
by
groups
of
men
to
wild
animals
and
plants
probably
always
originated
in
the
hunting
stage
of
society
it
has
by
no
means
been
confined
to
that
primitive
phase
of
human
development
but
has
often
survived
not
only
into
the
pastoral
but
into
the
agricultural
stage
as
we
may
see
for
example
by
the
case
of
many
tribes
in
africa
india
and
america
and
it
seems
likely
that
a
similar
overlapping
of
the
various
strata
takes
place
in
every
instance
in
short
we
can
not
really
dissect
the
history
of
mankind
as
it
were
with
a
knife
into
a
series
of
neat
sections
each
sharply
marked
off
from
all
the
rest
by
a
texture
and
colour
of
its
own
we
may
indeed
do
so
theoretically
for
the
convenience
of
exposition
but
practically
the
textures
interlace
the
colours
melt
and
run
into
each
other
by
insensible
gradations
that
defy
the
edge
of
the
finest
instrument
of
analysis
which
we
can
apply
to
them
it
is
a
mere
truism
to
say
that
the
abstract
generalisations
of
science
can
never
adequately
comprehend
all
the
particulars
of
concrete
reality
the
facts
of
nature
will
always
burst
the
narrow
bonds
of
human
theories
before
quitting
this
part
of
our
subject
it
may
be
well
to
illustrate
by
one
or
two
examples
the
reverence
which
primitive
pastoral
tribes
pay
to
their
cattle
since
as
i
have
just
indicated
the
worship
of
sacred
bulls
by
the
ancient
egyptians
like
the
modern
hindoo
worship
of
cows
may
very
well
have
been
directly
derived
from
a
similar
respect
paid
by
their
remote
ancestors
to
their
cattle
a
good
instance
is
supplied
by
the
dinka
a
large
tribe
or
rather
nation
of
the
white
nile
every
idea
and
thought
of
the
dinka
says
schweinfurth
is
how
to
acquire
and
maintain
cattle
a
kind
of
reverence
would
seem
to
be
paid
to
them
even
their
offal
is
considered
of
high
importance
the
dung
which
is
burnt
to
ashes
for
sleeping
in
and
for
smearing
their
persons
and
the
urine
which
is
used
for
washing
and
as
a
substitute
for
salt
are
their
daily
requisites
it
must
be
owned
that
it
is
hard
to
reconcile
this
latter
usage
with
our
ideas
of
cleanliness
a
cow
is
never
slaughtered
but
when
sick
it
is
segregated
from
the
rest
and
carefully
tended
in
the
large
huts
built
for
the
purpose
only
those
that
die
naturally
or
by
an
accident
are
used
as
food
all
this
which
exists
among
most
of
the
pastoral
tribes
of
africa
may
perchance
appear
to
be
a
lingering
remnant
of
an
exploded
but
i
may
draw
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
dinka
are
by
no
means
disinclined
to
partake
of
any
feast
of
their
flesh
provided
that
the
slaughtered
animal
was
not
their
own
property
it
is
thus
more
the
delight
of
actual
possession
than
any
superstitious
estimate
that
makes
the
cow
to
them
an
object
of
reverence
indescribable
is
the
grief
when
either
death
or
rapine
has
robbed
a
dinka
of
his
cattle
he
is
prepared
to
redeem
their
loss
by
the
heaviest
sacrifices
for
they
are
dearer
to
him
than
wife
or
child
a
dead
cow
is
not
however
wantonly
buried
the
negro
is
not
sentimental
enough
for
that
such
an
occurrence
is
soon
bruited
abroad
and
the
neighbours
institute
a
carousal
which
is
quite
an
epoch
in
their
monotonous
life
the
bereaved
owner
himself
is
however
too
much
afflicted
at
the
loss
to
be
able
to
touch
a
morsel
of
the
carcass
of
his
departed
beast
not
unfrequently
in
their
sorrow
the
dinka
remain
for
days
silent
and
abstracted
as
though
their
trouble
were
too
heavy
for
them
to
a
rich
dinka
will
sometimes
keep
a
favourite
ox
and
treat
it
with
such
marks
of
respect
that
an
observer
has
compared
the
animal
to
the
apis
of
the
ancient
egyptians
here
and
there
we
are
told
beside
the
hut
of
a
wealthy
negro
is
set
up
a
great
withered
tree
from
its
boughs
hang
vessels
containing
food
and
perhaps
trophies
of
war
to
its
trunk
is
fastened
the
great
drum
which
summons
to
war
or
to
the
dance

this
tree

from

rest
of
the
cattle

tethered

great
fat
ox

of
a
white
colour

into
a
slaty
grey

the
shoulders

its
long
horns

artificially
bent
to
opposite
sides

adorned
with

has
singled
him
out
from
his
youth
for
his
colour
and
certain
marks
has
cherished
and
reared
him
in
order
that
he
may
one
day
be
his
pride

the
eyes
of
the
village

tenderest
attention

bring
him
a
bundle
of
the
finest
herbs

he
can
procure
a
bell
he
hangs
it
round
the

at

speaking
of
the
nuehr
another
pastoral
tribe
of
the
upper
nile
a
traveller
tells
us
that
as
among
the
dinka
so
among
the
the
cattle
enjoy
a
respect
indeed
we
may
say
a
veneration
which
reminds
us
of
the
animal
worship
of
the
ancient
egyptians
especially
of
that
of
the
holy
steer
apis
though
the
respect
may
be
grounded
on
the
simple
fact
that
cattle
are
the
only
possession
of
these
negroes
the
largest
and
handsomest
bull
is
the
leader
of
the
herd
he
is
decked
with
bunches
of
hair
and
small
bells
marked
out
from
the
rest
in
every
way
and
regarded
as
the
guardian
genius
of
the
herd
as
well
as
of
the
family
his
loss
is
the
greatest
misfortune
that
can
befall
his
owner
at
night
his
master
drives
the
animal
round
the
herd
couched
about
the
smoky
fire
and
sings
of
his
beauty
and
courage
while
the
bull
signifies
his
contentment
by
a
complacent
lowing
to
him
his
master
every
morning
commits
the
herd
in
order
that
he
may
guide
them
to
the
best
pastures
and
guard
them
from
danger
in
him
he
reveres
his
ideal
of
all
that
is
beautiful
and
strong
nay
he
designates
him
by
the
same
name
which
he
applies
to
his
own
dim
conception
of
a
supreme
being
and
to
the
virbius
and
the
horse
we
are
now
in
a
position
to
hazard
a
conjecture
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
tradition
that
virbius
the
first
of
the
divine
kings
of
the
wood
at
aricia
had
been
killed
in
the
character
of
hippolytus
by
horses
having
found
first
that
spirits
of
the
corn
are
not
infrequently
represented
in
the
form
of
horses
and
second
that
the
animal
which
in
later
legends
is
said
to
have
injured
the
god
was
sometimes
originally
the
god
himself
we
may
conjecture
that
the
horses
by
which
virbius
or
hippolytus
was
said
to
have
been
slain
were
really
embodiments
of
him
as
a
deity
of
vegetation
the
myth
that
he
had
been
killed
by
horses
was
probably
invented
to
explain
certain
features
in
his
worship
amongst
others
the
custom
of
excluding
horses
from
his
sacred
grove
for
myth
changes
while
custom
remains
constant
men
continue
to
do
what
their
fathers
did
before
them
though
the
reasons
on
which
their
fathers
acted
have
been
long
forgotten
the
history
of
religion
is
a
long
attempt
to
reconcile
old
custom
with
new
reason
to
find
a
sound
theory
for
an
absurd
practice
in
the
case
before
us
we
may
be
sure
that
the
myth
is
more
modern
than
the
custom
and
by
no
means
represents
the
original
reason
for
excluding
horses
from
the
grove
from
their
exclusion
it
might
be
inferred
that
horses
could
not
be
the
sacred
animals
or
embodiments
of
the
god
of
the
grove
but
the
inference
would
be
rash
the
goat
was
at
one
time
a
sacred
animal
or
embodiment
of
athena
as
may
be
inferred
from
the
practice
of
representing
the
goddess
clad
in
a
yet
the
goat
was
neither
sacrificed
to
her
as
a
rule
nor
allowed
to
enter
her
great
sanctuary
the
acropolis
at
athens
the
reason
alleged
for
this
was
that
the
goat
injured
the
olive
the
sacred
tree
of
athena
so
far
therefore
the
relation
of
the
goat
of
athena
is
parallel
to
the
relation
of
the
horse
to
virbius
both
animals
being
excluded
from
the
sanctuary
on
the
ground
of
injury
done
by
them
to
the
god
but
from
varro
we
learn
that
there
was
an
exception
to
the
rule
which
excluded
the
goat
from
the
acropolis
once
a
year
he
says
the
goat
was
driven
on
to
the
acropolis
for
a
necessary
sacrifice
now
as
has
been
remarked
before
when
an
animal
is
sacrificed
once
and
once
only
in
the
year
it
is
probably
slain
not
as
a
victim
offered
to
the
god
but
as
a
representative
of
the
god
himself
therefore
we
may
infer
that
if
a
goat
was
sacrificed
on
the
acropolis
once
a
year
it
was
sacrificed
in
the
character
of
athena
herself
and
it
may
be
conjectured
that
the
skin
of
the
sacrificed
animal
was
placed
on
the
statue
of
the
goddess
and
formed
the
which
would
thus
be
renewed
annually
similarly
at
thebes
in
egypt
rams
were
sacred
and
were
not
sacrificed
but
on
one
day
in
the
year
a
ram
was
killed
and
its
skin
was
placed
on
the
statue
of
the
god
ammon
now
if
we
knew
the
ritual
of
the
arician
grove
better
we
might
find
that
the
rule
of
excluding
horses
from
it
like
the
rule
of
excluding
goats
from
the
acropolis
at
athens
was
subject
to
an
annual
exception
a
horse
being
once
a
year
taken
into
the
grove
and
sacrificed
as
an
embodiment
of
the
god
virbius
by
the
usual
misunderstanding
the
horse
thus
killed
would
come
in
time
to
be
regarded
as
an
enemy
offered
up
in
sacrifice
to
the
god
whom
he
had
injured
like
the
pig
which
was
sacrificed
to
demeter
and
osiris
or
the
goat
which
was
sacrificed
to
dionysus
and
possibly
to
athena
it
is
so
easy
for
a
writer
to
record
a
rule
without
noticing
an
exception
that
we
need
not
wonder
at
finding
the
rule
of
the
arician
grove
recorded
without
any
mention
of
an
exception
such
as
i
suppose
if
we
had
had
only
the
statements
of
athenaeus
and
pliny
we
should
have
known
only
the
rule
which
forbade
the
sacrifice
of
goats
to
athena
and
excluded
them
from
the
acropolis
without
being
aware
of
the
important
exception
which
the
fortunate
preservation
of
varro
s
work
has
revealed
to
us
the
conjecture
that
once
a
year
a
horse
may
have
been
sacrificed
in
the
arician
grove
as
a
representative
of
the
deity
of
the
grove
derives
some
support
from
the
similar
sacrifice
of
a
horse
which
took
place
once
a
year
at
rome
on
the
fifteenth
of
october
in
each
year
a
was
run
on
the
field
of
mars
stabbed
with
a
spear
the
horse
of
the
victorious
team
was
then
sacrificed
to
mars
for
the
purpose
of
ensuring
good
crops
and
its
head
was
cut
off
and
adorned
with
a
string
of
loaves
thereupon
the
inhabitants
of
two
sacred
way
and
the
with
each
other
who
should
get
the
head
if
the
people
of
the
sacred
way
got
it
they
fastened
it
to
a
wall
of
the
king
s
house
if
the
people
of
the
subura
got
it
they
fastened
it
to
the
mamilian
tower
the
horse
s
tail
was
cut
off
and
carried
to
the
king
s
house
with
such
speed
that
the
blood
dripped
on
the
hearth
of
the
house
further
it
appears
that
the
blood
of
the
horse
was
caught
and
preserved
till
the
of
april
when
the
vestal
virgins
mixed
it
with
the
blood
of
the
unborn
calves
which
had
been
sacrificed
six
days
before
the
mixture
was
then
distributed
to
shepherds
and
used
by
them
for
fumigating
their
flocks
in
this
ceremony
the
decoration
of
the
horse
s
head
with
a
string
of
loaves
and
the
alleged
object
of
the
sacrifice
namely
to
procure
a
good
harvest
seem
to
indicate
that
the
horse
was
killed
as
one
of
those
animal
representatives
of
the
of
which
we
have
found
so
many
examples
the
custom
of
cutting
off
the
horse
s
tail
is
like
the
african
custom
of
cutting
off
the
tails
of
the
oxen
and
sacrificing
them
to
obtain
a
good
crop
in
both
the
roman
and
the
african
custom
the
animal
apparently
stands
for
the
and
its
fructifying
power
is
supposed
to
reside
especially
in
its
tail
the
latter
idea
occurs
as
we
have
seen
in
european
again
the
practice
of
fumigating
the
cattle
in
spring
with
the
blood
of
the
horse
may
be
compared
with
the
practice
of
giving
the
old
wife
the
maiden
or
the
sheaf
as
fodder
to
the
horses
in
spring
or
the
cattle
at
christmas
and
giving
the
yule
boar
to
the
ploughing
oxen
or
horses
to
eat
in
spring
all
these
usages
aim
at
ensuring
the
blessing
of
the
on
the
homestead
and
its
inmates
and
storing
it
up
for
another
year
the
roman
sacrifice
of
the
october
horse
as
it
was
called
carries
us
back
to
the
early
days
when
the
subura
afterwards
a
low
and
squalid
quarter
of
the
great
metropolis
was
still
a
separate
village
whose
inhabitants
engaged
in
a
friendly
contest
on
the
with
their
neighbours
of
rome
then
a
little
rural
town
the
field
of
mars
on
which
the
ceremony
took
place
lay
beside
the
tiber
and
formed
part
of
the
king
s
domain
down
to
the
abolition
of
the
monarchy
for
tradition
ran
that
at
the
time
when
the
last
of
the
kings
was
driven
from
rome
the
corn
stood
ripe
for
the
sickle
on
the
crown
lands
beside
the
river
but
no
one
would
eat
the
accursed
grain
and
it
was
flung
into
the
river
in
such
heaps
that
the
water
being
low
with
the
summer
heat
it
formed
the
nucleus
of
an
island
the
horse
sacrifice
was
thus
an
old
autumn
custom
observed
upon
the
king
s
at
the
end
of
the
harvest
the
tail
and
blood
of
the
horse
as
the
chief
parts
of
the
s
representative
were
taken
to
the
king
s
house
and
kept
there
just
as
in
germany
the
is
nailed
on
the
gable
or
over
the
door
of
the
farmhouse
and
as
the
last
sheaf
in
the
form
of
the
maiden
is
carried
home
and
kept
over
the
fireplace
in
the
highlands
of
scotland
thus
the
blessing
of
the
was
brought
to
the
king
s
house
and
hearth
and
through
them
to
the
community
of
which
he
was
the
head
similarly
in
the
spring
and
autumn
customs
of
northern
europe
the
maypole
is
sometimes
set
up
in
front
of
the
house
of
the
mayor
or
burgomaster
and
the
last
sheaf
at
harvest
is
brought
to
him
as
the
head
of
the
village
but
while
the
tail
and
blood
fell
to
the
king
the
neighbouring
village
of
the
subura
which
no
doubt
once
had
a
similar
ceremony
of
its
own
was
gratified
by
being
allowed
to
compete
for
the
prize
of
the
horse
s
head
the
mamilian
tower
to
which
the
suburans
nailed
the
horse
s
head
when
they
succeeded
in
carrying
it
off
appears
to
have
been
a
or
keep
of
the
old
mamilian
family
the
magnates
of
the
village
the
ceremony
thus
performed
on
the
king
s
fields
and
at
his
house
on
behalf
of
the
whole
town
and
of
the
neighbouring
village
presupposes
a
time
when
each
township
performed
a
similar
ceremony
on
its
own
fields
in
the
rural
districts
of
latium
the
villages
may
have
continued
to
observe
the
custom
each
on
its
own
land
long
after
the
roman
hamlets
had
merged
their
separate
in
the
common
celebration
on
the
king
s
lands
there
is
no
intrinsic
improbability
in
the
supposition
that
the
sacred
grove
of
aricia
like
the
field
of
mars
at
rome
may
have
been
the
scene
of
a
common
harvest
celebration
at
which
a
horse
was
sacrificed
with
the
same
rude
rites
on
behalf
of
the
neighbouring
villages
the
horse
would
represent
the
fructifying
spirit
both
of
the
tree
and
of
the
corn
for
the
two
ideas
melt
into
each
other
as
we
see
in
customs
like
the
however
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
evidence
for
thus
interpreting
the
relation
of
horses
to
virbius
is
exceedingly
slender
and
that
the
custom
of
excluding
horses
from
the
sacred
arician
grove
may
have
been
based
on
some
other
superstitious
motive
which
entirely
escapes
us
at
the
city
of
ialysus
in
rhodes
there
was
a
sanctuary
of
alectrona
one
of
the
daughters
of
the
sun
into
which
no
horse
ass
mule
or
beast
of
burden
of
any
kind
might
enter
any
person
who
broke
the
law
by
introducing
one
of
these
animals
into
the
holy
precinct
had
to
purify
the
place
by
a
sacrifice
and
the
same
atonement
had
to
be
made
by
any
man
who
brought
shoes
or
any
portion
of
a
pig
within
the
sacred
boundaries
and
whoever
drove
or
suffered
his
sheep
to
stray
into
the
precinct
was
obliged
to
pay
a
fine
of
one
obol
for
every
sheep
that
set
foot
in
it
the
reasons
for
these
prohibitions
are
quite
unknown
and
the
taboo
on
horses
is
particularly
remarkable
since
the
rhodians
were
in
the
habit
of
offering
a
chariot
and
horses
every
year
to
the
sun
the
father
of
alectrona
doubtless
in
order
that
he
might
ride
on
them
through
the
sky
did
they
think
that
it
was
not
for
the
daughter
of
the
sun
to
meddle
with
horses
which
were
the
peculiar
property
of
her
father
the
conjecture
may
perhaps
be
supported
by
an
analogy
drawn
from
west
africa
the
ewe
negroes
of
the
slave
coast
conceive
the
nyikplã
as
a
man
who
rides
a
horse
and
who
may
be
seen
galloping
on
it
through
the
sky
in
the
form
of
a
shooting
star
hence
in
the
town
of
angla
where
he
generally
resides
when
he
is
at
home
no
person
may
appear
on
horseback
in
the
streets
that
being
apparently
regarded
as
an
impious
usurpation
of
the
style
of
the
deity
in
former
days
even
europeans
were
forbidden
to
ride
on
horseback
in
angla
and
missionaries
who
attempted
to
set
the
local
prejudice
at
defiance
have
been
pelted
with
sticks
and
dirt
by
the
outraged
natives
another
deity
who
suffered
not
horses
to
enter
his
sacred
place
was
rakelimalaza
a
malagasy
god
whose
name
signifies
renowned
although
his
residence
was
a
village
situated
on
the
top
of
a
hill
about
seven
miles
east
of
tananarivo
but
horses
were
not
the
only
animal
or
thing
to
which
this
fastidious
being
entertained
a
rooted
aversion
within
the
limits
of
the
ground
which
is
considered
sacred
and
which
embraces
a
wide
circumference
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
idol
s
residence
it
is
strictly
forbidden
to
bring
or
to
suffer
to
come
certain
animals
and
certain
objects
which
are
carefully
specified
by
the
keepers
of
the
idol
things
thus
forbidden
are
called
a
term
of
similar
import
with
the
tabu
of
the
south
sea
islands
every
idol
has
its
own
particular
the
things
prohibited
by
rakelimalaza
are
guns
gunpowder
pigs
onions
sifotra
a
resembling
a
snail
sitry
a
small
animal
resembling
the
young
crocodile
striped
or
spotted
robes
anything
of
a
black
colour
goats
horses
meat
distributed
at
funerals
or
at
the
and
cats
and
owls
its
keepers
are
forbidden
to
enter
any
house
where
there
is
a
corpse
and
in
crossing
a
river
they
are
not
permitted
to
say
carry
me
otherwise
they
place
themselves
in
danger
of
being
seized
by
the
crocodiles
and
in
war
they
must
not
talk
or
they
are
in
danger
of
being
to
attempt
to
discover
the
particular
reasons
for
all
these
numerous
and
varied
taboos
would
obviously
be
futile
many
of
them
may
be
based
on
accidental
circumstances
which
for
us
are
lost
past
recovery
but
it
may
be
worth
while
to
observe
that
a
variety
of
taboos
was
enforced
at
other
ancient
greek
shrines
besides
the
sanctuary
of
alectrona
at
ialysus
for
example
no
person
was
allowed
to
enter
the
sanctuary
of
the
mistress
at
lycosura
in
arcadia
clad
in
black
purple
or
flowered
vestments
or
wearing
shoes
or
a
ring
or
with
his
or
her
hair
plaited
or
covered
or
carrying
flowers
in
his
hand
and
no
pomegranates
might
be
brought
into
the
sanctuary
though
all
other
fruits
of
the
orchard
were
free
to
enter
these
instances
may
warn
us
against
the
danger
of
arguing
too
confidently
in
favour
of
any
one
of
the
many
possible
reasons
which
may
have
moved
the
old
latins
to
exclude
horses
from
the
sacred
arician
grove
the
domain
of
primitive
superstition
in
spite
of
the
encroachments
of
science
is
indeed
still
to
a
great
extent
a
trackless
wilderness
a
tangled
maze
in
the
gloomy
recesses
of
which
the
forlorn
explorer
may
wander
for
ever
without
a
light
and
without
a
clue
chapter
x
eating
the
god
the
sacrament
of
we
have
now
seen
that
the
is
represented
sometimes
in
human
sometimes
in
animal
form
and
that
in
both
cases
he
is
killed
in
the
person
of
his
representative
and
eaten
sacramentally
to
find
examples
of
actually
killing
the
human
representative
of
the
we
had
naturally
to
go
to
savage
races
but
the
of
our
european
peasants
have
furnished
unmistakable
examples
of
the
sacramental
eating
of
animals
as
representatives
of
the
but
further
as
might
have
been
anticipated
the
new
corn
is
itself
eaten
sacramentally
that
is
as
the
body
of
the
in
wermland
sweden
the
farmer
s
wife
uses
the
grain
of
the
last
sheaf
to
bake
a
loaf
in
the
shape
of
a
little
girl
this
loaf
is
divided
amongst
the
whole
household
and
eaten
by
them
here
the
loaf
represents
the
conceived
as
a
maiden
just
as
in
scotland
the
is
similarly
conceived
and
represented
by
the
last
sheaf
made
up
in
the
form
of
a
woman
and
bearing
the
name
of
the
maiden
as
usual
the
is
believed
to
reside
in
the
last
sheaf
and
to
eat
a
loaf
made
from
the
last
sheaf
is
therefore
to
eat
the
itself
similarly
at
la
palisse
in
france
a
man
made
of
dough
is
hung
upon
the
which
is
carried
on
the
last
the
tree
and
the
are
taken
to
the
mayor
s
house
and
kept
there
till
the
vintage
is
over
then
the
close
of
the
harvest
is
celebrated
by
a
feast
at
which
the
mayor
breaks
the
in
pieces
and
gives
the
pieces
to
the
people
to
eat
in
these
examples
the
is
represented
and
eaten
in
human
shape
in
other
cases
though
the
new
corn
is
not
baked
in
loaves
of
human
shape
still
the
solemn
ceremonies
with
which
it
is
eaten
suffice
to
indicate
that
it
is
partaken
of
sacramentally
that
is
as
the
body
of
the
for
example
the
following
ceremonies
used
to
be
observed
by
lithuanian
peasants
at
eating
the
new
corn
about
the
time
of
the
autumn
sowing
when
all
the
corn
had
been
got
in
and
the
threshing
had
begun
each
farmer
held
a
festival
called
sabarios
that
is
the
mixing
or
throwing
he
took
nine
good
handfuls
of
each
kind
of
barley
oats
flax
beans
lentils
and
the
rest
and
each
handful
he
divided
into
three
parts
the
portions
of
each
grain
were
then
thrown
on
a
heap
and
all
mixed
up
together
the
grain
used
had
to
be
that
which
was
first
threshed
and
winnowed
and
which
had
been
set
aside
and
kept
for
this
purpose
a
part
of
the
grain
thus
mixed
was
employed
to
bake
little
loaves
one
for
each
of
the
household
the
rest
was
mixed
with
more
barley
or
oats
and
made
into
beer
the
first
beer
brewed
from
this
mixture
was
for
the
drinking
of
the
farmer
his
wife
and
children
the
second
brew
was
for
the
servants
the
beer
being
ready
the
farmer
chose
an
evening
when
no
stranger
was
expected
then
he
knelt
down
before
the
barrel
of
beer
drew
a
jugful
of
the
liquor
and
poured
it
on
the
bung
of
the
barrel
saying
o
fruitful
earth
make
rye
and
barley
and
all
kinds
of
corn
to
next
he
took
the
jug
to
the
parlour
where
his
wife
and
children
awaited
him
on
the
floor
of
the
parlour
lay
bound
a
black
or
white
or
speckled
not
a
red
cock
and
a
hen
of
the
same
colour
and
of
the
same
brood
which
must
have
been
hatched
within
the
year
then
the
farmer
knelt
down
with
the
jug
in
his
hand
and
thanked
god
for
the
harvest
and
prayed
for
a
good
crop
next
year
next
all
lifted
up
their
hands
and
said
o
god
and
thou
o
earth
we
give
you
this
cock
and
hen
as
a
with
that
the
farmer
killed
the
fowls
with
the
blows
of
a
wooden
spoon
for
he
might
not
cut
their
heads
off
after
the
first
prayer
and
after
killing
each
of
the
birds
he
poured
out
a
third
of
the
beer
then
his
wife
boiled
the
fowls
in
a
new
pot
which
had
never
been
used
before
after
that
a
bushel
was
set
bottom
upwards
on
the
floor
and
on
it
were
placed
the
little
loaves
mentioned
above
and
the
boiled
fowls
next
the
new
beer
was
fetched
together
with
a
ladle
and
three
mugs
none
of
which
was
used
except
on
this
occasion
when
the
farmer
had
ladled
the
beer
into
the
mugs
the
family
knelt
down
round
the
bushel
the
father
then
uttered
a
prayer
and
drank
off
the
three
mugs
of
beer
the
rest
followed
his
example
then
the
loaves
and
the
flesh
of
the
fowls
were
eaten
after
which
the
beer
went
round
again
till
every
one
had
emptied
each
of
the
three
mugs
nine
times
none
of
the
food
should
remain
over
but
if
anything
did
happen
to
be
left
it
was
consumed
next
morning
with
the
same
ceremonies
the
bones
were
given
to
the
dog
to
eat
if
he
did
not
eat
them
all
up
the
remains
were
buried
under
the
dung
in
the
this
ceremony
was
observed
at
the
beginning
of
december
on
the
day
on
which
it
took
place
no
bad
word
might
be
spoken
such
was
the
custom
about
two
hundred
years
or
more
ago
at
the
present
day
in
lithuania
when
new
potatoes
or
loaves
made
from
the
new
corn
are
being
eaten
all
the
people
at
table
pull
each
other
s
hair
the
meaning
of
this
last
custom
is
obscure
but
a
similar
custom
was
certainly
observed
by
the
heathen
lithuanians
at
their
solemn
sacrifices
many
of
the
esthonians
of
the
island
of
oesel
will
not
eat
bread
baked
of
the
new
corn
till
they
have
first
taken
a
bite
at
a
piece
of
iron
the
iron
is
here
plainly
a
charm
intended
to
render
harmless
the
spirit
that
is
in
the
corn
in
sutherlandshire
at
the
present
day
when
the
new
potatoes
are
dug
all
the
family
must
taste
them
otherwise
the
spirits
in
them
the
potatoes
take
offence
and
the
potatoes
would
not
in
one
part
of
yorkshire
it
is
still
customary
for
the
clergyman
to
cut
the
first
corn
and
my
informant
believes
that
the
corn
so
cut
is
used
to
make
the
communion
bread
if
the
latter
part
of
the
custom
is
correctly
reported
and
analogy
is
all
in
its
favour
it
shews
how
the
christian
communion
has
absorbed
within
itself
a
sacrament
which
is
doubtless
far
older
than
christianity
among
the
heathen
cheremiss
on
the
left
bank
of
the
volga
when
the
first
bread
baked
from
the
new
corn
is
to
be
eaten
the
villagers
assemble
in
the
house
of
the
oldest
inhabitant
the
eastern
door
is
opened
and
all
pray
with
their
faces
towards
it
then
the
sorcerer
or
priest
gives
to
each
of
them
a
mug
of
beer
which
they
drain
next
he
cuts
and
hands
to
every
person
a
morsel
of
the
loaf
which
they
partake
of
finally
the
young
people
go
to
the
elders
and
bowing
down
to
the
earth
before
them
say
we
pray
god
that
you
may
live
and
that
god
may
let
us
pray
next
year
for
new
the
rest
of
the
day
is
passed
in
mirth
and
dancing
the
whole
ceremony
observes
the
writer
who
has
described
it
looks
almost
like
a
caricature
of
the
eucharist
according
to
another
account
each
cheremiss
householder
on
this
occasion
after
bathing
places
some
of
each
kind
of
grain
together
with
malt
cakes
and
drink
in
a
vessel
which
he
holds
up
to
the
sun
at
the
same
time
thanking
the
gods
for
the
good
things
which
they
have
bestowed
upon
him
but
this
part
of
the
ceremony
is
a
sacrifice
rather
than
a
sacrament
of
the
new
corn
the
aino
or
ainu
of
japan
are
said
to
distinguish
various
kinds
of
millet
as
male
and
female
respectively
and
these
kinds
taken
together
are
called
the
divine
husband
and
wife
cereal
haru
therefore
before
millet
is
pounded
and
made
into
cakes
for
general
eating
the
old
men
have
a
few
made
for
themselves
first
to
worship
when
they
are
ready
they
pray
to
them
very
earnestly
and
say
o
thou
cereal
deity
we
worship
thee
thou
hast
grown
very
well
this
year
and
thy
flavour
will
be
sweet
thou
art
good
the
goddess
of
fire
will
be
glad
and
we
also
shall
rejoice
greatly
o
thou
god
o
thou
divine
cereal
do
thou
nourish
the
people
i
now
partake
of
thee
i
worship
thee
and
give
thee
after
having
thus
prayed
they
the
worshippers
take
a
cake
and
eat
it
and
from
this
time
the
people
may
all
partake
of
the
new
millet
and
so
with
many
gestures
of
homage
and
words
of
prayer
this
kind
of
food
is
dedicated
to
the
of
the
ainu
no
doubt
the
cereal
offering
is
regarded
as
a
tribute
paid
to
god
but
that
god
is
no
other
than
the
seed
itself
and
it
is
only
a
god
in
so
far
as
it
is
beneficial
to
the
human
the
natives
of
the
reef
islands
in
melanesia
describe
as
follows
the
ceremonies
which
they
observe
at
eating
new
fruits
when
the
fruit
of
trees
that
are
eatable
such
as
or
nuts
is
nearly
ripe
about
a
month
before
the
time
that
people
eat
it
they
all
go
together
into
the
bush
they
must
all
go
together
for
this
holy
eating
and
when
they
return
they
all
assemble
in
one
place
and
no
one
will
be
absent
they
sit
down
and
cook
while
it
is
being
cooked
no
one
will
eat
beforehand
but
they
set
it
in
order
and
cook
it
with
reverence
and
with
the
belief
that
the
spirit
has
granted
that
food
to
them
and
they
return
thanks
to
him
for
it
when
it
is
cooked
a
certain
man
takes
a
and
climbs
up
a
tree
and
all
the
people
stand
on
the
ground
and
they
all
look
up
and
when
he
has
reached
the
top
they
shout
out
and
when
they
have
shouted
they
call
out
this
is
the
of
the
whole
land
then
he
throws
down
the
and
they
pick
it
up
and
shout
out
again
and
give
thanks
for
they
think
that
the
spirit
who
protects
the
fruit
will
hear
their
thoughts
are
thus
also
with
regard
to
the
yam
there
is
no
difference
it
is
all
the
same
they
think
that
a
spirit
gives
them
food
and
the
people
assemble
together
and
thank
the
spirit
in
every
island
they
think
that
there
is
a
spirit
presiding
over
at
bourail
in
new
caledonia
the
eating
of
the
first
yams
of
the
season
is
a
solemn
ceremony
the
women
may
take
no
part
in
it
indeed
for
five
days
previously
they
may
not
even
shew
themselves
on
any
pretext
and
must
hide
in
the
forest
but
the
men
of
other
tribes
are
invited
to
share
in
the
festivity
on
the
day
of
the
ceremony
seven
or
eight
yams
are
dug
up
with
the
greatest
precaution
wrapt
in
leaves
and
carried
before
the
great
wooden
images
ten
or
twelve
feet
high
rudely
carved
in
human
form
and
painted
black
red
and
white
which
represent
the
ancestors
of
the
tribe
special
pots
only
used
on
these
occasions
are
then
disinterred
by
boys
who
cook
the
new
yams
in
them
eat
them
and
afterwards
bury
the
pots
in
the
places
where
they
found
them
thereupon
the
chief
or
the
oldest
man
mounts
a
ladder
and
addresses
the
crowd
in
a
long
and
voluble
harangue
telling
them
how
their
forefathers
always
respected
the
feast
of
the
first
yams
and
exhorting
the
young
men
of
the
tribe
to
do
the
same
in
the
time
to
come
after
that
turning
towards
the
ancestral
images
he
prays
them
to
give
a
good
crop
of
yams
every
year
to
the
people
and
their
descendants
adjuring
them
to
remember
how
while
they
were
still
on
earth
they
always
ate
to
their
heart
s
content
and
beseeching
them
to
reflect
that
their
sons
and
grandsons
naturally
desire
to
do
the
same
when
the
orator
has
finished
his
discourse
and
his
hearers
have
signified
their
approval
of
his
eloquence
by
a
loud
grunt
the
new
yams
are
dressed
and
eaten
each
family
cooking
them
in
a
pot
of
its
own
at
the
close
of
the

a
common
sacramental
meal
to
which
every
member
of
the
clan
is
bound
to
contribute
a
little
of
the
new
rice
this
meal
is
called
eating
the
soul
of
the
rice
a
name
which
clearly
indicates
the
sacramental
character
of
the
repast
some
of
the
rice
is
also
set
apart
and
offered
to
the
spirits
amongst
the
alfoors
of

on
his
own
field
and
next
on
those
of
his
neighbours
all
the
rice
thus
plucked
by
him
he
dries
along
with
his

have
it
ground
and
boiled
when

planting
by
making
six

in
the

depositing
in
them
when
the
crop
is
ripe
the
rice

and
the
first
to

this
feast
has
been
held
may
the
owners
of
sell
their
rice
among
the
kayans
of
central
borneo
who
as
we
have
seen
believe
rice
to
be
animated
by
a
soul
before
a
family
partakes
of
the
new
rice
at
harvest
a
priestess
must
touch
the
face
and
breast
of
every
person
with
a
magical
instrument
consisting
of
the
husk
of
a
certain

he
or
she
eats
a
few
grains
of
the
new
rice
and
drinks
a
little
water
when
all
have
complied
with
this
ritual
the
feast
begins
amongst
the
burghers
or
badagas
a
tribe
of
the
neilgherry
hills
in
southern
india
the
first
handful
of
seed
is
sown
and
the
first
sheaf
reaped
by
a
man
of
a
different
tribe
the
members
of
which
the
burghers
regard
as
sorcerers
the
grain
contained
in
the
first
sheaf
is
that
day
reduced
to
meal
made
into
cakes
and
being
offered
as
a

is
together
with
the
remainder
of
the

animal
partaken
of
by
the
burgher
and
the
whole
of
his
family
as
the
meat
of
a
federal
offering
and
amongst
the
coorgs
of
southern
india
the
man
who
is
to
cut
the
first
sheaf
of
rice
at
harvest
is
chosen
by
an
astrologer
at
sunset
the
whole
household
takes
a
hot
bath
and
then
goes
to
the
where
the
chosen
reaper
cuts
an
armful
of
rice
with
a
new
sickle
and
distributes
two
or
more
stalks
to
all
present
then
all
return
to
the
a
bundle
of
leaves
is
adorned
with
a
stalk
of
rice
and
fastened
to
the
post
in
the
centre
of
the
enough
of
the
new
rice
is
now
threshed
cleaned
and
ground
to
provide
flour
for
the
which
each
member
of
the
household
is
to
eat
then
they
go
to
the
door
of
the
house
where
the
mistress
washes
the
feet
of
the
and
presents
to
him
and
after
him
to
all
the
rest
a
brass
vessel
full
of
milk
honey
and
sugar
from
which
each

takes
a

receives
a
little
of
his

on
an
ashvatha
leaf
and
eats
it
the
ceremony
is
then
over
and
the
mixes
with
the
company
when
he
was
engaged
in
cutting
the
rice
no
one
might
touch
him
among
the
hindoos
of
southern
india
the
eating
of
the
new
rice
is
the
occasion
of
a
family
festival
called
pongol
the
new
rice
is
boiled
in
a
new
pot
on
a
fire
which
is
kindled
at
noon
on
the
day
when
according
to
hindoo
astrologers
the
sun
enters
the
tropic
of
capricorn
the
boiling
of
the
pot
is
watched
with
great
anxiety
by
the
whole
family
for
as
the
milk
boils
so
will
the
coming
year
be
if
the
milk
boils
rapidly
the
year
will
be
prosperous
but
it
will
be
the
reverse
if
the
milk
boils
slowly
some
of
the
new
boiled
rice
is
offered
to
the
image
of
gaṇeṣa
then
every
one
partakes
of
it
in
some
parts
of
northern
india
the
festival
of
the
new
crop
is
known
as
that
is
new
when
the
crop
is
ripe
the
owner
takes
the
omens
goes
to
the
field
plucks
five
or
six
ears
of
barley
in
the
spring
crop
and
one
of
the
millets
in
the
autumn
harvest
this
is
brought
home
parched
and
mixed
with
coarse
sugar
butter
and
curds
some
of
it
is
thrown
on
the
fire
in
the
name
of
the
village
gods
and
deceased
ancestors
the
rest
is
eaten
by
the
family
at
gilgit
in
the
hindoo
koosh
before
begins
a
member
of
every
household
gathers
a
handful
of
ears
of
corn
secretly
at
dusk
a
few
of
the
ears
are
hung
up
over
the
door
of
the
house
and
the
rest
are
roasted
next
morning
and
eaten
steeped
in
milk
the
day
is
spent
in
rejoicings
and
next
morning
the
harvest
begins
the
chams
of
in
may
not
reap
the
until
they
have
offered
the
to
the
goddess
of
agriculture
and
have
consumed
them
sacramentally
these
are
gathered
from
certain
sacred
fields
called
or
fields
of
secret
tillage
which
are
both
sown
and
reaped
with
peculiar
ceremonies
apparently
the
tilling
of
the
earth
is
considered
a
crime
which
must
be
perpetrated
secretly
and
afterwards
atoned
for
on
a
lucky
day
in
june
at
the
first
two
men
lead
the
buffaloes
and
the
plough
to
the
sacred
field
round
which
they
draw
three
furrows
in
profound
silence
and
then
retire
afterwards
at
dawn
the
owner
of
the
land
comes
lounging
by
as
if
by
the
merest
chance
at
sight
of
the
furrows
he
stops
pretends
to
be
much
surprised
and
cries
out
who
has
been
secretly
ploughing
my
field
this
night
hastening
home
he
kills
a
kid
or
some
fowls
cooks
the
victuals
and
prepares
five
quids
of
betel
some
candles
a
flask
of
oil
and
lustral
water
of
three
different
sorts
with
these
offerings
and
the
plough
drawn
by
the
buffaloes
he
returns
to
the
field
where
he
lights
the
candles
and
spreading
out
the
victuals
worships
and
the
other
deities
saying
i
know
not
who
has
secretly
ploughed
my
field
this
night
pardon
ye
gods
those
who
have
done
this
wrong
accept
these
offerings
bless
us
suffer
us
to
proceed
with
this
then
speaking
in
the
name
of
the
deities
he
gives
the
reassuring
answer
all
right
plough
away
with
the
lustral
water
he
washes
or
sprinkles
the
buffaloes
the
yoke
and
the
plough
the
oil
serves
to
anoint
the
plough
and
to
pour
libations
on
the
ground
the
five
quids
of
betel
are
buried
in
the
field
thereupon
the
owner
sows
a
handful
of
rice
on
the
three
furrows
that
have
been
traced
and
eats
the
victuals
with
his
people
after
all
these
rites
have
been
duly
performed
he
may
plough
and
sow
his
land
as
he
likes
when
the
rice
has
grown
high
enough
in
this
field
of
secret
tillage
to
hide
pigeons
offerings
of
ducks
eggs
and
fowls
are
made
to
the
deities
and
fresh
offerings
which
generally
consist
of
five
plates
of
rice

after
that
the

of
the
land
cuts
three
stalks
of

with
a
sickle
in
the
middle
of
the
field
then
he
cuts

handfuls
at

these
ceremonies
have
been
performed
is
the
proprietor
at
liberty
to
reap
the
rest
of
that
field
and
all
the
others
the
ceremony
of
eating
the
new
yams
at
onitsha
on
the
niger
is
thus
described
each
headman
brought
out
six
yams
and
cut
down
young
branches
of
and
placed
them
before
his
gate
roasted
three
of
the
yams
and
got
some
and
fish
after
the
yam
is
roasted
the
or
country
doctor
takes
the
yam
scrapes
it
into
a
sort
of
meal
and
divides
it
into
halves
he
then
takes
one
piece
and
places
it
on
the
lips
of
the
person
who
is
going
to
eat
the
new
yam
the
eater
then
blows
up
the
steam
from
the
hot
yam
and
afterwards
pokes
the
whole
into
his
mouth
and
says
i
thank
god
for
being
permitted
to
eat
the
new
yam
he
then
begins
to
chew
it
heartily
with
fish
among
the
ewe
negroes
of
west
africa
the
eating
of
the
new
yams
is
the
greatest
festival
of
the
year
it
usually
falls
at
the
beginning
of
september
and
its
character
is
predominantly
religious
we
possess
a
native
account
of
the
festival
as
it
is
celebrated
by
the
tribe
of
the
hos
in
togoland
when
the
yams
are
ripe
and
ready
to
be
dug
up
and
brought
home
two
days
are
devoted
to
cleansing
the
town
of
all
ills
whether
spiritual
or
material
as
a
solemn
preparation
for
the
ensuing
celebration
when
these
rites
of
purification
which
will
be
described
in
a
later
part
of
this
work
have
been
accomplished
then
in
the
words
of
the
native
account
the
people
make
ready
to
eat
the
new
yams
and
the
manner
of
making
ready
consists
in
going
to
the
fields
and
digging
the
yams
however
they
do
not
bring
them
home
but
lay
them
down
somewhere
on
the
way
the
reason
why
they
do
not
bring
them
home
is
that
the
people
have
not
yet
been
on
the
place
where
they
sacrifice
to
the
deity
when
they
wish
to
go
thither
the
way
to
the
sacrificial
place
of
agbasia
must
first
be
cleared
of
grass
afterwards
the
people
come
with
their
drums
which
they
beat
loudly
when
they
are
come
to
the
place
of
sacrifice
they
first
raise
two
great
mounds
of
earth
and
they
bring
to
the
place
of
sacrifice
palm
wine
uncooked
and
cooked
yams
and
meal
mixed
with
oil
first
of
all
the
uncooked
yams
are
cut
in
two
through
the
middle
and
then
this
prayer
is
offered
agbasia
thou
art
he
who
has
given
the
yams
therefore
here
is
thine
own
we
thank
thee
sincerely
may
the
eating
of
the
yams
be
a
great
joy
and
may
no
quarrel
intervene
thereupon
they
lay
down
on
the
ground
yams
mixed
with
oil
and
not
mixed
with
oil
in
doing
so
they
say
to
agbasia
he
who
eats
not
the
white
yams
to
him
belong
the
yams
mixed
with
oil
and
he
who
eats
not
the
yams
mixed
with
oil
to
him
belong
the
white
they
do
the
same
with
the
meal
that
is
mixed
with
oil
and
with
the
meal
that
is
not
mixed
with
oil
thereby
they
say
here
we
bring
thee
all
that
thou
hast
given
us
eat
thereof
what
thou
pleasest
after
that
they
pour
palm
wine
into
one
pot
and
water
into
another
and
say
when
one
has
eaten
one
drinks
thereby
the
drums
sound
songs
are
sung
and
the
priest
says
our
father
agbasia
we
pray
thee
let
us
hear
no
more
evil
but
good
only
when
women
are
with
child
let
them
bear
twins
and
triplets
that
we
may
increase
and
multiply
when
the
time
for
sowing
the
yams
comes
again
make
it
to
rain
upon
them
even
more
than
hitherto
in
order
that
we
may
come
again
and
thank
thee
more
sincerely
than
hitherto
thereupon
the
priest
pours
water
on
one
of
the
mounds
makes
a
paste
with
it
and
calls
the
people
thither
then
he
dips
his
finger
in
the
slime
and
smears
it
on
their
brows
temples
and
breasts
saying
this
is
the
slime
of
agbasia
wherewith
i
smear
you
that
ye
may
remain
in
after
that
they
disperse
and
go
home
further
the
prayers
and
offerings
of
the
individual
peasants
on
the
occasion
of
the
yam
festival
are
described
as
follows
in
the
evening
when
the
town
is
swept
clean
the
people
go
to
the
fields
to
fetch
yams
which
however
they
may
not
yet
bring
into
the
town
and
therefore
they
hide
them
in
the
forest
as
soon
as
the
high
priest
quits
the
town
next
morning
to
go
to
the
sacrificial
place
of
his
god
the
women
set
out
to
fetch
the
yams
which
they
had
deposited
now
they
begin
to
cook
many
people
kill
fowls
or
goats
and
others
buy
fish
for
the
festival
when
the
yams
are
sodden
a
little
is
broken
off
mixed
with
oil
and
laid
together
with
uncooked
yams
on
the
ground
at
the
entrance
to
the
homestead
thereby
the

that
belongs
to
all
those
gods
who
abide
at
the
he
does
the
same
under
the
door
of
the
house
and
says
that
belongs
to
all
those
gods
who
dwell
with
then
he
goes
to
the
loom
and
brings
it
its
offering
and
says
that
belongs
to
all
the
artificers
who
have
helped
me
in
after
that
he
lays
all
his
charms
on
a
mat
spread
in
the
house
and
brings
them
also
their
offering
and
speaks
with
another

with
it
to

the
artificers

this
yam
and
eat
when
they
practise
their
art
may
it
prosper
again
he
takes
a
raw
yam
and
goes
with
it
under
the
and
prays
o
my
and
all
ye
gods
who
pay
heed
to
this
house

and
eat
yams
when
i
also
eat
of
them
may
i
remain
healthy
and
nowhere
feel
pain
may
my
housemates
all
remain
healthy
after
he
has
invoked
their
protection
on
his
family
he
takes
a
cooked
yam
crumbles
it
on
a
stone
and
mixes
it
with
red
oil
with
this
mixture
he
goes
again
to
the
loom
and
prays
as
before
but
even
that
is
not
the
end
of
the
worship
of
the
artificers
he
again
crumbles
a
cooked
yam
but
this
time
he
does
not
mix
it
with
red
oil
he
goes
to
the
entrance
of
the
homestead
and
prays
again
to
the
loom
he
among
the
artificers
who
does
not
relish
yams
mixed
with
oil
let
him
come
and
take
the
white
yam
and
eat
it
from
there
he
goes
again
under
the
and
prays
he
of
my
guardian
gods
and
he
of
the
watchers
of
the
house
who
likes
not
yams
mixed
with
oil
let
him
come
and
take
the
white
yam
from
my
hand
and
eat
from
the
he
steps
into
the
midst
of
the
chamber
and
says
he
who
relishes
not
the
yams
mixed
with
oil
may
eat
the
white
he
who
relishes
not
the
white
may
eat
the
red
and
he
who
relishes
not
the
red
may
eat
the
uncooked
with
this
prayer
he
has
completed
his
duties
as
just
as
the
weaver
prays
to
his
loom
so
the
hunter
prays
to
his
musket
the
smith
to
his
hammer
and
anvil
and
the
carpenter
to
his
plane
and
saw
now
while
the
free
people
begin
to
cook
the
yams
so
soon
as
the
priest
has
left
the
town
the
slaves
of
the
earth
gods
the
must
first
as
children
perform
their
duties
to
the
priest
of
their
gods
each
of
these
children
receives
from
his
parents
on
the
morning
of
the
yam
festival
two
pieces
of
yam
which
he
brings
to
the
priest
of
his
god
the
priest
cuts
off
a
small
piece
of
the
yam
and
divides
the
piece
again
into
four
pieces
the
child
kneels
before
him
and
lolls
out
his
tongue
holding
two
of
these
pieces
of
yam
in
his
hands
the
priest
utters
a
prayer
over
the
child
and
touches
his
tongue
five
times
with
the
pieces
of
yam
then
the
child
stretches
his
hands
out
each
of
which
the
priest
touches
five
times
with
the
same
pieces
of
yam
and
prays
as
before
then
he
touches
both
feet
of
the
child
five
times
and
prays
for
the
third
time
he
takes
half
of
the
which
the
child
has
brought
fastens
them
on
a
string
and
hangs
it
round
the
child
s
neck
thereby
the
child
gets
leave
to
eat
new
yams
after
all
these
preparations
the
yams
are
pounded
into
a
mash
and
every
one
calls
his
brother
that
he
may
eat
with
him
when
the
meal
is
over
the
people
are
called
together
to
amuse
themselves
and
to

ashantees
celebrate
the
festival
of
the
new
yams
early
in
september
until
it
is
over
none
of
the
people
may
taste
of
the
new
yams
the
yam
custom
we
are
told
is
like
the
saturnalia
neither
theft
intrigue
nor
assault
are
punishable
during
the
continuance
but
the
grossest
liberty
prevails
and
each
sex
abandons
itself
to
its
an
has
described
the
scene
at
coomassie
the
capital
the
next
morning
the
king
ordered
a
large
quantity
of
rum
to
be
poured
into
brass
pans
in
various
parts
of
the
town
the
crowd
pressing
around
and
drinking
like
hogs
freemen
and
slaves
women
and
children
striking
kicking
and
trampling
each
other
under
foot
pushed
head
foremost
into
the
pans
and
spilling
much
more
than
they
drank
in
less
than
an
hour
excepting
the
principal
men
not
a
sober
person
was
to
be
seen
parties
of
four
reeling
and
rolling
under
the
weight
of
another
whom
they
affected
to
be
carrying
home
strings
of
women
covered
with
red
paint
hand
in
hand
falling
down
like
rows
of
cards
the
commonest
mechanics
and
slaves
furiously
declaiming
on
state
palavers
the
most
discordant
music
the
most
obscene
songs
children
of
both
sexes
prostrate
in
insensibility
all
wore
their
handsomest
cloths
which
they
trailed
after
them
to
a
great
length
in
a
drunken
emulation
of
extravagance
and
about
a
hundred
persons
mostly
culprits
reserved
for
the
purpose
used
to
be
sacrificed
at
this
festival
in
coomassie
all
the
chiefs
killed
several
slaves
that
their
blood
might
flow
into
the
hole
from
which
the
new
yam
was
taken
such
as
could
not
afford
to
kill
slaves
took
the
head
of
a
slave
who
had
already
been
sacrificed
and
placed
it
in
the
hole
about
ten
days
after
these
ceremonies
the
whole
of
the
royal
household
ate
new
yams
for
the
first
time
in
the
the
king
himself
being
in
attendance
next
day
he
and
his
captains
set
off
before
sunrise
to
perform
their
annual
ablutions
in
the
river
dah
almost
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
capital
followed
him
so
that
the
streets
appeared
to
be
deserted
the
following
day
the
king
attended
by
his
suite
washed
in
the
marsh
at
the
end
of
the
town
and
laved
the
water
not
only
over
himself
but
also
over
the
chairs
stools
gold
and
silver
plate
and
the
articles
of
furniture
which
were
set
aside
for
his
special
use
from
another
account
it
appears
that
the
king
of
ashantee
must
eat
the
new
yams
before
any
of
his
subjects
was
at
liberty
to
do
so
similarly
in
the
west
african
kingdom
of
assinie
which
forms
part
of
the
french
possessions
of
senegal
the
king
must
eat
the
new
yams
eight
full
days
before
the
people
may
taste
them
a
second
festival
of
yams
used
to
be
celebrated
at
coomassie
in
december
when
the
king
or
a
fetish
priest
consecrated
the
new
yams
before
they
could
be
eaten
by
common
folk
on
one
of
the
days
of
this
december
celebration
all
the
laws
were
suspended
and
every
man
might
do
what
seemed
good
in
his
own
eyes
he
might
even
contrary
to
custom
look
at
the
king
s
wives
to
the
number
of
several
hundreds
when
they
returned
with
the
king
and
his
suite
from
washing
in
the
fetish
water
of
tana
all
that
day
drinking
went
on
and
the
noise
and
uproar
were
prolonged
far
into
the
night
early
in
the
morning
a
human
victim
was
sacrificed
the
first
man
found
near
the
gates
of
the
palace
was
seized
butchered
and
cut
in
pieces
and
the
executioners
danced
with
the
bleeding
fragments
of
the
victim
in
their
hands
or
fastened
round
their
necks
before
he
ate
of
the
new
yams
the
king
washed
himself
in
fetish
water
brought
from
distant
springs
and
the
chiefs
performed
similar
ablutions
in
benin
the
new
yams
might
not
be
eaten
until
the
king
had
performed
certain
ceremonies
among
which
one
is
said
to
have
been
a
pretence
of
making
a
yam
to
grow
in
a
pot
dancing
merrymaking
and
farces
or
plays
formed
part
of
the
festival
the
city
was
crowded
with
people
and
they
indulged
in
a
regular
orgie
among
the
nandi
of
british
east
africa
when
the
eleusine
grain
is
ripening
in
autumn
every
woman
who
owns
a
cornfield
goes
out
into
it
with
her
daughters
and
they
all
pluck
some
of
the
ripe
grain
each
of
the
women
then
fixes
one
grain
in
her
necklace
and
chews
another
which
she
rubs
on
her
forehead
throat
and
breast
no
mark
of
joy
escapes
them
sorrowfully
they
cut
a
basketful
of
the
new
corn
and
carrying
it
home
place
it
in
the
loft
to
dry
as
the
ceiling
is
of
wickerwork
a
good
deal
of
the
grain
drops
through
the
crevices
and
falls
into
the
fire
where
it
explodes
with
a
crackling
noise
the
people
make
no
attempt
to
prevent
this
waste
for
they
regard
the
crackling
of
the
grain
in
the
fire
as
a
sign
that
the
souls
of
the
dead
are
partaking
of
it
a
few
days
later
porridge
is
made
from
the
new
grain
and
served
up
with
milk
at
the
evening
meal
all
the
members
of
the
family
take
some
of
the
porridge
and
dab
it
on
the
walls
and
roofs
of
the
huts
also
they
put
a
little
in
their
mouths
and
spit
it
out
towards
the
east
and
on
the
outside
of
the
huts
then
holding
up
some
of
the
grain
in
his
hand
the
head
of
the
family
prays
to
god
for
health
and
strength
and
likewise
for
milk
and
everybody
present
repeats
the
words
of
the
prayer
after
him
amongst
the
baganda
when
the
beans
were
ripe
a
woman
would
call
her
eldest
son
to
eat
some
of
the
first
which
she
cooked
if
she
neglected
to
do
so
it
was
believed
that
she
would
incur
the
displeasure
of
the
gods
and
fall
after
the
meal
her
husband
jumped
over
her
and
the
beans
might
thereafter
be
eaten
by
all
amongst
the
caffres
of
natal
and
zululand
no
one
may
eat
of
the
new
fruits
till
after
a
festival
which
marks
the
beginning
of
the
caffre
year
and
falls
at
the
end
of
december
or
the
beginning
of
january
all
the
people
assemble
at
the
king
s
kraal
where
they
feast
and
dance
before
they
separate
the
dedication
of
the
people
takes
place
various
fruits
of
the
earth
as
corn
mealies
and
pumpkins
mixed
with
the
flesh
of
a
sacrificed
animal
and
with
medicine
are
boiled
in
great
pots
and
a
little
of
this
food
is
placed
in
each
man
s
mouth
by
the
king
himself
after
thus
partaking
of
the
sanctified
fruits
a
man
is
himself
sanctified
for
the
whole
year
and
may
immediately
get
in
his
crops
it
is
believed
that
if
any
man
were
to
partake
of
the
new
fruits
before
the
festival
he
would
die
if
he
were
detected
he
would
be
put
to
death
or
at
least
all
his
cattle
would
be
taken
from
him
the
holiness
of
the
new
fruits
is
well
marked
by
the
rule
that
they
must
be
cooked
in
a
special
pot
which
is
used
only
for
this
purpose
and
on
a
new
fire
kindled
by
a
magician
through
the
friction
of
two
sticks
which
are
called
husband
and
these
sticks
are
prepared
by
the
sorcerers
from
the
wood
of
the
tree
and
belong
exclusively
to
the
chief
the
wife
is
the
shorter
of
the
two
when
the
magician
has
kindled
the
new
fire
on
which
the
new
fruits
are
to
be
cooked
he
hands
the
back
to
the
chief
for
no
other
hand
may
touch
them
and
they
are
then
put
away
till
they
are
required
next
season
the
sticks
are
regarded
as
in
a
measure
sacred
and
no
one
except
the
chief
s
personal
servant
may
go
to
the
side
of
the
hut
where
they
are
kept
no
pot
but
the
one
used
for
the
preparation
of
this
feast
may
be
set
on
a
fire
made
by
the
friction
of
the
husband
and
when
the
feast
is
over
the
fire
is
carefully
extinguished
and
the
pot
is
put
away
with
the
where
it
remains
untouched
for
another
year
a
remarkable
feature
of
the
festival
as
it
is
observed
at
the
court
of
the
zulu
king
is
a
dance
performed
by
the
king
himself
in
a
mantle
of
grass
or
according
to
another
account
of
herbs
and
this
mantle
is
afterwards
burnt
and
its
ashes
are
scattered
and
trodden
into
the
ground
by
cattle
further
it
is
worthy
of
notice
that
the
festival
is
described
as
a
saturnalia
and
we
are
told
that
a
great
deal
of
noise
and
dancing
goes
on
and
people
are
not
supposed
to
be
responsible
for
what
they
say
or
thus
for
example
among
the
pondos
the
festival
includes
a
period
of
license
during
the
continuance
of
which
the
chief
abdicates
his
functions
and
any
crime
may
be
committed
with
impunity
the
description
of
the
pondo
festival
comprises
so
many
interesting
features
that
i
will
reproduce
it
entire
when
a
pondo
chief
is
to
hold
the
feast
of
some
of
his
people
procure
a
ripe
plant
of
the
gourd
family
pumpkin
or
calabash
from
another
tribe
this
is
cooked
the
inside
cleaned
out
and
the
rind
made
ready
for
use
as
a
vessel
it
is
then
presented
to
the
chief
with
much
ceremony
the
are
now
brought
forward
and
a
sacrifice
generally
a
young
bull
is
offered
after
which
the
feast
commences
the
chief
issues
certain
orders
for
the
conduct
of
the
proceedings
tastes
the
fruits
which
are
served
in
the
with
which
he
has
been
presented
and
then
abdicates
all
his
functions
while
the
festival
lasts
the
cattle
from
all
the
neighbouring
villages
are
collected
in
the
vicinity
and
now
they
are
brought
together
and
the
bulls
incited
to
fight
to
determine
which
is
to
be
king
among
them
for
the
next
year
the
young
people
engage
in
games
and
dances
feats
of
strength
and
running
after
these
are
over
the
whole
community
give
themselves
over
to
disorder
debauchery
and
riot
in
their
and
games
they
but
did
honour
to
the
powers
of
nature
and
now
as
they
eat
and
drink
the
same
powers
are
honoured
in
another
form
and
by
other
rites
there
is
no
one
in
authority
to
keep
order
and
every
man
does
what
seems
good
in
his
own
eyes
should
a
man
stab
his
neighbour
he
escapes
all
punishment
and
so
too
with
all
other
crimes
against
the
person
property
and
morality
people
are
even
permitted
to
abuse
the
chief
to
his
face
an
offence
which
at
any
other
time
would
meet
with
summary
vengeance
and
an
unceremonious
dispatch
to
join
the
ancestors
while
the
feast
continues
a
deafening
noise
is
kept
up
by
drumming
shouting
and
every
kind
of
instrument
that
can
be
made
to
emit
sound
men
advance
to
the
chief
and
explain
their
origin
and
also
the
object
they
hold
sacred
by
imitating
the
sounds
and
movements
of
their
most
sacred
animal
this
is
the
person
s
totem
others
imitate
the
gurgling
made
by
an
enemy
when
stabbed
in
the
throat
those
who
adopt
this
latter
emblem
are
known
as
children
of
the
when
the
ceremonies
revels
and
mummeries
are
ended
the
chief
repairs
to
his
accustomed
place
and
sitting
down
there
by
that
act
resumes
his
kingly
functions
he
calls
the
bravest
of
his
braves
before
him
who
is
immediately
clothed
and
decorated
with
skins
of
animals
suggestive
of
courage
and
strategy
he
performs
a
dance
amid
the
frenzied
shouting
of
the
multitude
after
which
the
chief
declares
the
festival
at
an
end
and
harvest
another
writer
speaking
of
the
zulu
festival
of
as
it
was
celebrated
in
the
time
of
the
ferocious
despot
chaka
says
that
at
this
period
the
chiefs
are
allowed
to
converse
unreservedly
with
the
king
speaking
with
great
freedom
and
in
some
measure
to
be
again
another
traveller
who
visited
the
zulus
in
the
reign
of
king
panda
tells
us
that
in
spite
of
the
practice
of
the
most
absolute
despotism
there
are
three
days
in
the
year
when
the
nation
in
its
turn
has
the
right
to
call
the
king
to
a
severe
account
for
his
acts
it
is
at
the
general
assembly
of
the
warriors
when
the
maize
is
ripe
that
the
lively
discussions
take
place
and
the
questions
are
put
to
which
the
king
must
answer
at
once
in
a
manner
satisfactory
to
the
people
i
have
then
seen
simple
warriors
come
leaping
from
the
ranks
assume
the
style
of
fluent
and
excessively
energetic
orators
and
not
only
confront
the
fiery
glare
of
panda
but
even
attack
him
before
everybody
blame
his
acts
call
them
infamous
and
base
compel
him
to
vindicate
his
conduct
and
then
refute
his
vindication
by
dissecting
it
and
exposing
its
falsehood
finally
proceeding
to
haughty
threats
and
winding
up
the
harangue
with
a
gesture
of
such
liberties
taken
with
the
despotic
zulu
kings
seem
to
point
to
a
time
when
they
too
like
the
pondo
chiefs
abdicated
or
were
deposed
during
the
festival
perhaps
we
may
even
go
a
step
further
we
have
seen
that
on
this
occasion
the
zulu
king
dances
in
a
mantle
of
grass
or
of
herbs
and
which
is
afterwards
burnt
and
the
ashes
scattered
and
trodden
into
the
ground
this
custom
seems
clearly
intended
to
promote
the
fertility
of
the
earth
and
in
earlier
times
the
same
end
may
have
been
compassed
by
burning
the
king
himself
and
dispersing
his
ashes
for
we
have
seen
that
a
bechuana
tribe
of
the
same
bantu
stock
as
the
zulus
were
wont
to
sacrifice
a
human
victim
for
the
good
of
the
crops
and
to
scatter
his
ashes
over
the
ground
in
this
connexion
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
we
have
found
independent
evidence
of
a
custom
of
putting
the
zulu
king
to
death
whenever
his
bodily
strength
began
to
fail
among
the
bechuanas
it
is
a
rule
that
before
they
partake
of
the
new
crops
they
must
purify
themselves
the
purification
takes
place
at
the
commencement
of
the
new
year
on
a
day
in
january
which
is
fixed
by
the
chief
it
begins
in
the
great
kraal
of
the
tribe
where
all
the
adult
males
assemble
each
of
them
takes
in
his
hand
leaves
of
a
gourd
called
by
the
natives
described
as
something
between
a
pumpkin
and
a
vegetable
marrow
and
having
crushed
the
leaves
he
anoints
with
the
expressed
juice
his
big
toes
and
his
navel
many
people
indeed
apply
the
juice
to
all
the
joints
of
their
body
but
the
say
that
this
is
a
vulgar
departure
from
ancient
custom
after
this
ceremony
in
the
great
kraal
every
man
goes
home
to
his
own
kraal
assembles
all
the
members
of
his
family
men
women
and
children
and
smears
them
all
with
the
juice
of
the
leaves
some
of
the
leaves
are
also
pounded
mixed
with
milk
in
a
large
wooden
dish
and
given
to
the
dogs
to
lap
up
then
the
porridge
plate
of
each
member
of
the
family
is
rubbed
with
the
leaves
when
this
purification
has
been
completed
but
not
before
the
people
are
free
to
eat
of
the
new
crops
on
the
night
after
the
purification
every
man
was
bound
as
a
matter
of
ritual
to
sleep
with
his
chief
wife
if
she
had
been
unfaithful
to
him
during
the
past
year
it
was
incumbent
on
her
to
confess
her
sin
before
she
fulfilled
her
part
of
the
ceremony
having
confessed
she
was
purified
by
a
who
fumigated
her
with
the
smoke
produced
by
burning
a
bean
plant
thereupon
husband
and
wife
cut
each
other
slightly
under
the
navel
and
each
of
them
rubbed
his
or
her
blood
mixed
with
medicine
into
the
other
s
wound
that
completed
the
purification
of
the
woman
and
the
pair
might
now
proceed
with
the
rest
of
the
rite
should
a
married
man
be
from
home
at
the
time
when
the
annual
purification
ceremony
is
performed
he
is
thought
to
be
in
a
very
sad
plight
indeed
his
chances
of
surviving
for
another
year
are
supposed
to
be
small
on
his
return
home
he
dare
not
enter
his
own
house
for
he
would
pollute
it
and
if
even
his
shadow
were
to
fall
on
one
of
his
children
the
child
would
die
he
must
wait
till
his
wife
comes
to
him
and
brings
him
a
calabash
of
water
to
drink
which
is
a
sign
that
she
has
waited
for
his
return
to
perform
the
rite
of
purification
together
but
if
she
does
not
bring
the
water
he
knows
that
in
his
absence
she
has
performed
the
rite
with
some
other
man
and
it
becomes
necessary
to
purge
her
by
means
of
fumigation
and
as
described
before
but
even
when
that
purgation
is
completed
husband
and
wife
may
not
indulge
in
connubial
intercourse
for
the
rest
of
the
year
that
is
until
the
next
annual
purification
has
taken
place
the
bechuanas
think
that
any
breach
of
this
rule
will
be
punished
with
supernatural
husband
wife
or
child
will
among
the
matabele
another
bantu
tribe
of
south
africa
no
one
might
partake
of
the
new
fruits
till
the
king
had
first
tasted
of
them
any
one
who
was
known
to
have
broken
the
law
was
instantly
put
to
death
on
this
occasion
the
regiments
assembled
at
bulawayo
the
capital
and
danced
in
a
great
semicircle
before
the
king
who
occasionally
joined
in
the
dance
when
he
did
so
the
and
their
satellites
armed
with
rushed
about
among
the
dancers
and
incited
them
to
fresh
efforts
by
a
vigorous
application
of
the
thorns
to
the
bodies
of
such
as
seemed
to
flag
the
king
s
wives
also
sang
and
danced
before
him
in
long
lines
holding
the
marriage
ring
in
their
right
hands
and
green
boughs
in
their
left
on
the
third
day
of
the
festival
hundreds
of
oxen
were
sacrificed
the
flesh
and
blood
of
the
black
or
sacred
cattle
were
converted
into
charms
while
the
carcases
of
the
rest
were
cut
up
and
distributed
among
the
people
who
feasted
upon
them
the
fourth
day
was
specially
set
apart
for
the
ceremony
of
the
in
the
morning
all
the
people
went
down
to
the
river
to
wash
and
on
their
return
a
or
took
a
dish
of
the
new
vegetables
and
corn
mixed
with
charms
and
scattered
the
contents
by
handfuls
among
the
crowd
who
seized
and
ate
them
after
that
the
people
were
free
to
eat
the
new
crops
according
to
one
account
this
festival
of
was
held
at
the
first
full
moon
which
followed
the
summer
solstice
the
of
december
in
the
southern
hemisphere
according
to
another
account
it
took
place
a
few
days
after
the
full
moon
of
february
which
marked
the
beginning
of
the
matabele
year
the
ovambo
or
as
they
call
themselves
the
ovakuanjama
of
africa
may
not
partake
of
the
new
fruits
of
the
tree
which
ripen
in
february
and
from
which
an
intoxicating
beverage
is
extracted
until
certain
ceremonies
have
been
performed
among
other
things
husband
and
wife
mutually
offer
each
other
one
of
the
fruits
make
white
strokes
with
chalk
each
on
the
brow
cheeks
and
nose
of
the
other
and
accompany
the
action
with
the
formal
expression
of
good
wishes
if
this
ceremony
which
seems
to
mark
the
beginning
of
the
new
year
were
omitted
they
believe
that
they
would
be
attacked
by
a
painful
disease
of
the
which
would
cripple
them
the
bororo
indians
of
brazil
think
that
it
would
be
certain
death
to
eat
the
new
maize
before
it
has
been
blessed
by
the
the
ceremony
of
blessing
it
is
as
follows
the
husk
is
washed
and
placed
before
the
who
by
dancing
and
singing
for
several
hours
and
by
incessant
smoking
works
himself
up
into
a
state
of
ecstasy
whereupon
he
bites
into
the
husk
trembling
in
every
limb
and
uttering
shrieks
from
time
to
time
a
similar
ceremony
is
performed
whenever
a
large
animal
or
a
large
fish
is
killed
the
bororo
are
firmly
persuaded
that
were
any
man
to
touch
unconsecrated
maize
or
meat
before
the
ceremony
had
been
completed
he
and
his
whole
tribe
would
perish
amongst
the
creek
indians
of
north
america
the
or
festival
of
was
the
chief
ceremony
of
the
year
it
was
held
in
july
or
august
when
the
corn
was
ripe
and
marked
the
end
of
the
old
year
and
the
beginning
of
the
new
one
before
it
took
place
none
of
the
indians
would
eat
or
even
handle
any
part
of
the
new
harvest
sometimes
each
town
had
its
own
busk
sometimes
several
towns
united
to
hold
one
in
common
before
celebrating
the
busk
the
people
provided
themselves
with
new
clothes
and
new
household
utensils
and
furniture
they
collected
their
old
clothes
and
rubbish
together
with
all
the
remaining
grain
and
other
old
provisions
cast
them
together
in
one
common
heap
and
consumed
them
with
fire
as
a
preparation
for
the
ceremony
all
the
fires
in
the
village
were
extinguished
and
the
ashes
swept
clean
away
in
particular
the
hearth
or
altar
of
the
temple
was
dug
up
and
the
ashes
carried
out
then
the
chief
priest
put
some
roots
of
the
plant
with
some
green
tobacco
leaves
and
a
little
of
the
new
fruits
at
the
bottom
of
the
fireplace
which
he
afterwards
commanded
to
be
covered
up
with
white
clay
and
wetted
over
with
clean
water
a
thick
arbour
of
green
branches
of
young
trees
was
then
made
over
the
altar
meanwhile
the
women
at
home
were
cleaning
out
their
houses
renewing
the
old
hearths
and
scouring
all
the
cooking
vessels
that
they
might
be
ready
to
receive
the
new
fire
and
the
new
fruits
the
public
or
sacred
square
was
carefully
swept
of
even
the
smallest
crumbs
of
previous
feasts
for
fear
of
polluting
the
also
every
vessel
that
had
contained
or
had
been
used
about
any
food
during
the
expiring
year
was
removed
from
the
temple
before
sunset
then
all
the
men
who
were
not
known
to
have
violated
the
law
of
the
offering
and
that
of
marriage
during
the
year
were
summoned
by
a
crier
to
enter
the
holy
square
and
observe
a
solemn
fast
but
the
women
except
six
old
ones
the
children
and
all
who
had
not
attained
the
rank
of
warriors
were
forbidden
to
enter
the
square
sentinels
were
also
posted
at
the
corners
of
the
square
to
keep
out
all
persons
deemed
impure
and
all
animals
a
strict
fast
was
then
observed
for
two
nights
and
a
day
the
devotees
drinking
a
bitter
decoction
of
root
in
order
to
vomit
and
purge
their
sinful
that
the
people
outside
the
square
might
also
be
purified
one
of
the
old
men
laid
down
a
quantity
of
green
tobacco
at
a
corner
of
the
square
this
was
carried
off
by
an
old
woman
and
distributed
to
the
people
without
who
chewed
and
swallowed
it
in
order
to
afflict
their
during
this
general
fast
the
women
children
and
men
of
weak
constitution
were
allowed
to
eat
after
but
not
before
on
the
morning
when
the
fast
ended
the
women
brought
a
quantity
of
the
old
year
s
food
to
the
outside
of
the
sacred
square
these
provisions
were
then
fetched
in
and
set
before
the
famished
multitude
but
all
traces
of
them
had
to
be
removed
before
noon
when
the
sun
was
declining
from
the
meridian
all
the
people
were
commanded
by
the
voice
of
a
crier
to
stay
within
doors
to
do
no
bad
act
and
to
be
sure
to
extinguish
and
throw
away
every
spark
of
the
old
fire
universal
silence
now
reigned
then
the
high
priest
made
the
new
fire
by
the
friction
of
two
pieces
of
wood
and
placed
it
on
the
altar
under
the
green
arbour
this
new
fire
was
believed
to
atone
for
all
past
crimes
except
murder
next
a
basket
of
new
fruits
was
brought
the
high
priest
took
out
a
little
of
each
sort
of
fruit
rubbed
it
with
bear
s
oil
and
offered
it
together
with
some
flesh
to
the
bountiful
holy
spirit
of
fire
as
a
offering
and
an
annual
oblation
for
he
also
consecrated
the
sacred
emetics
the
root
and
the
cassina
or
by
pouring
a
little
of
them
into
the
fire
the
persons
who
had
remained
outside
now
approached
without
entering
the
sacred
square
and
the
chief
priest
thereupon
made
a
speech
exhorting
the
people
to
observe
their
old
rites
and
customs
announcing
that
the
new
divine
fire
had
purged
away
the
sins
of
the
past
year
and
earnestly
warning
the
women
that
if
any
of
them
had
not
extinguished
the
old
fire
or
had
contracted
any
impurity
they
must
forthwith
depart
lest
the
divine
fire
should
spoil
both
them
and
the
some
of
the
new
fire
was
then
set
down
outside
the
holy
square
the
women
carried
it
home
joyfully
and
laid
it
on
their
unpolluted
hearths
when
several
towns
had
united
to
celebrate
the
festival
the
new
fire
might
thus
be
carried
for
several
miles
the
new
fruits
were
then
dressed
on
the
new
fires
and
eaten
with
bear
s
oil
which
was
deemed
indispensable
at
one
point
of
the
festival
the
men
rubbed
the
new
corn
between
their
hands
then
on
their
faces
and
breasts
during
the
festival
which
followed
the
warriors
dressed
in
their
wild
martial
array
their
heads
covered
with
white
down
and
carrying
white
feathers
in
their
hands
danced
round
the
sacred
arbour
under
which
burned
the
new
fire
the
ceremonies
lasted
eight
days
during
which
the
strictest
continence
was
practised
towards
the
conclusion
of
the
festival
the
warriors
fought
a
mock
battle
then
the
men
and
women
together
in
three
circles
danced
round
the
sacred
fire
lastly
all
the
people
smeared
themselves
with
white
clay
and
bathed
in
running
water
they
came
out
of
the
water
believing
that
no
evil
could
now
befall
them
for
what
they
had
done
amiss
in
the
past
so
they
departed
in
joy
and
peace
ceremonies
of
the
same
general
type
are
still
annually
observed
by
the
yuchi
indians
of
oklahoma
who
belong
to
the
creek
nation
but
speak
a
different
language
the
rites
are
said
to
have
been
instituted
by
the
sun
they
are
solemnised
in
the
public
square
and
are
timed
so
as
to
coincide
with
the
ripening
of
the
corn
which
usually
takes
place
about
the
middle
or
early
part
of
july
continence
and
abstinence
from
salt
are
prescribed
during
their
celebration
and
all
the
men
must
fast
for
twelve
hours
before
they
take
the
emetic
a
sacred
new
fire
is
kindled
by
striking
two
stones
against
each
other
after
which
all
the
males
are
scarified
or
scratched
by
an
official
on
the
arm
or
breast
so
as
to
let
blood
flow
and
drip
on
the
ground
of
the
public
square
this
bleeding
of
the
men
is
said
to
be
symbolical
of
the
origin
of
the
yuchi
people
for
the
first
yuchi
sprang
from
some
drops
of
blood
which
the
mother
of
the
sun
let
fall
on
earth
at
one
of
her
monthly
periods
hence
the
yuchi
call
themselves
the
children
of
the
sun
the
solemn
rite
of
scratching
is
followed
by
the
no
less
solemn
rite
of
vomiting
this
also
was
instituted
by
the
sun
he
taught
the
indians
to
steep
the
root
and
the
red
root
in
water
and
to
drink
the
decoction
in
order
that
they
might
vomit
and
so
purify
their
bodies
against
sickness
during
the
ensuing
year
they
think
that
if
they
did
not
thus
purge
themselves
before
eating
the
new
corn
they
would
fall
sick
the
chief
of
the
town
is
charged
with
the
solemn
duty
of
preparing
the
nauseous
concoction
and
he
is
assisted
by
four
boys
who
have
been
initiated
into
the
mysteries
the
pots
containing
the
stuff
are
decorated
on
the
rim
with
a
pattern
representing
the
sun
and
they
stand
east
of
the
fire
near
the
middle
of
the
public
square
the
order
of
drinking
is
regulated
by
the
rank
of
the
drinkers
when
the
sun
is
about
the
zenith
the
four
noblest
come
forward
face
eastward
and
gulp
down
the
vile
but
salutary
potion
then
they
retire
to
their
places
and
await
the
usual
results
when
they
feel
the
inward
workings
of
the
draught
they
step
out
of
the
square
and
discharge
the
contents
of
their
stomachs
in
a
place
set
apart
for
the
purpose
they
are
followed
by
another
party
of
four
and
that
by
another
and
so
on
till
all
the
men
have
thus
purged
themselves
the
rite
is
repeated
several
times
when
it
is
over
they
all
go
to
water
and
wash
off
the
paint
with
which
they
were
adorned
then
returning
to
their
places
in
the
square
they
feast
on
the
new
corn
after
a
rest
of
some
hours
the
men
engage
in
ball
play
not
as
a
mere
recreation
but
as
a
matter
of
ritual
sides
are
chosen
every
player
is
equipped
with
two
rackets
and
the
aim
of
each
side
is
to
drive
the
ball
through
their
opponents
goal
which
consists
of
two
uprights
and
a
the
two
goals
stand
east
and
west
of
each
other
during
the
following
night
dancing
is
kept
up
and
a
general
laxity
degenerating
into
debauchery
prevails
but
parents
and
elders
wink
at
the
excesses
of
the
young
folk
among
the
dances
are
some
in
which
the
dancers
mimick
the
motions
and
cries
of
their
totemic
animals
such
as
ducks
buzzards
rabbits
fish
buffaloes
chickens
and
owls
to
this
day
also
the
remnant
of
the
seminole
indians
of
florida
a
people
of
the
same
stock
as
the
creeks
hold
an
annual
purification
and
festival
called
the
green
corn
dance
at
which
the
new
corn
is
eaten
on
the
evening
of
the
first
day
of
the
festival
they
quaff
a
nauseous
black
drink
as
it
is
called
which
acts
both
as
an
emetic
and
a
purgative
they
believe
that
he
who
does
not
drink
of
this
liquor
can
not
safely
eat
the
new
green
corn
and
besides
that
he
will
be
sick
at
some
time
in
the
year
while
the
liquor
is
being
drunk
the
dancing
begins
and
the
join
in
it
next
day
they
eat
of
the
green
corn
the
following
day
they
fast
probably
from
fear
of
polluting
the
sacred
food
in
their
stomachs
by
contact
with
common
food
but
the
third
day
they
hold
a
great
feast
further
the
natchez
indians
another
tribe
of
the
same
stock
who
used
to
inhabit
a
district
on
the
lower
course
and
eastern
bank
of
the
mississippi
ate
the
new
corn
sacramentally
at
a
great
festival
which
has
been
fully
described
by
du
pratz
the
french
historian
of
louisiana
as
his
work
is
probably
not
easily
accessible
to
many
of
my
readers
i
shall
perhaps
consult
their
convenience
by
extracting
his
description
entire
the
natchez
he
tells
us
began
their
year
in
march
and
divided
it
into
thirteen
moons
their
sixth
moon
which
answered
to
our
august
was
the
mulberry
moon
and
the
seventh
was
the
moon
of
maize
or
great
corn
this
feast
is
beyond
dispute
the
most
solemn
of
all
it
principally
consists
in
eating
in
common
and
in
a
religious
manner
of
new
corn
which
had
been
sown
expressly
with
that
design
with
suitable
ceremonies
this
corn
is
sown
upon
a
spot
of
ground
never
before
cultivated
which
ground
is
dressed
and
prepared
by
the
warriors
alone
who
also
are
the
only
persons
that
sow
the
corn
weed
it
reap
it
and
gather
it
when
this
corn
is
near
ripe
the
warriors
fix
on
a
place
proper
for
the
general
feast
and
close
adjoining
to
that
they
form
a
round
granary
the
bottom
and
sides
of
which
are
of
cane
this
they
fill
with
the
corn
and
when
they
have
finished
the
harvest
and
covered
the
granary
they
acquaint
the
great
sun
who
appoints
the
day
for
the
general
feast
some
days
before
the
feast
they
build
huts
for
the
great
sun
and
for
all
the
other
families
round
the
granary
that
of
the
great
sun
being
raised
upon
a
mound
of
earth
about
two
feet
high
on
the
the
whole
nation
set
out
from
their
village
at
leaving
behind
only
the
aged
and
infirm
that
are
not
able
to
travel
and
a
few
warriors
who
are
to
carry
the
great
sun
on
a
litter
upon
their
shoulders
the
seat
of
this
litter
is
covered
with
several
and
to
its
four
sides
are
fastened
four
bars
which
cross
each
other
and
are
supported
by
eight
men
who
at
every
hundred
paces
transfer
their
burden
to
eight
other
men
and
thus
successively
transport
it
to
the
place
where
the
feast
is
celebrated
which
may
be
near
two
miles
from
the
village
about
nine
o
clock
the
great
sun
comes
out
of
his
hut
dressed
in
the
ornaments
of
his
dignity
and
being
placed
in
his
litter
which
has
a
canopy
at
the
head
formed
of
flowers
he
is
carried
in
a
few
minutes
to
the
sacred
granary
shouts
of
joy
on
all
sides
before
he
alights
he
makes
the
tour
of
the
whole
place
deliberately
and
when
he
comes
before
the
corn
he
salutes
it
thrice
with
the
words
hoo
lengthened
and
pronounced
respectfully
the
salutation
is
repeated
by
the
whole
nation
who
pronounce
the
word
nine
times
distinctly
and
at
the
ninth
time
he
alights
and
places
himself
on
his
throne
immediately
after
they
light
a
fire
by
rubbing
two
pieces
of
wood
violently
against
each
other
and
when
everything
is
prepared
for
dressing
the
corn
the
chief
of
war
accompanied
by
the
warriors
belonging
to
each
family
presents
himself
before
the
throne
and
addresses
the
sun
in
these
words
speak
for
i
hear
the
sovereign
then
rises
up
bows
towards
the
four
quarters
of
the
world
and
advancing
to
the
granary
lifts
his
eyes
and
hands
to
heaven
and
says
give
us
corn
upon
which
the
great
chief
of
war
the
princes
and
princesses
and
all
the
men
thank
him
separately
by
pronouncing
the
word
the
corn
is
then
distributed
first
to
the
female
suns
and
then
to
all
the
women
who
run
with
it
to
their
huts
and
dress
it
with
the
utmost
dispatch
when
the
corn
is
dressed
in
all
the
huts
a
plate
of
it
is
put
into
the
hands
of
the
great
sun
who
presents
it
to
the
four
quarters
of
the
world
and
then
says
to
the
chief
of
war
eat
upon
this
signal
the
warriors
begin
to
eat
in
all
the
huts
after
them
the
boys
of
whatever
age
excepting
those
who
are
on
the
breast
and
last
of
all
the
women
when
the
warriors
have
finished
their
repast
they
form
themselves
into
two
choirs
before
the
huts
and
sing
war
songs
for
half
an
hour
after
which
the
chief
of
war
and
all
the
warriors
in
succession
recount
their
brave
exploits
and
mention
in
a
boasting
manner
the
number
of
enemies
they
have
slain
the
youths
are
next
allowed
to
harangue
and
each
tells
in
the
best
manner
he
can
not
what
he
has
done
but
what
he
intends
to
do
and
if
his
discourse
merits
approbation
he
is
answered
by
a
general
if
not
the
warriors
hang
down
their
heads
and
are
silent
this
great
solemnity
is
concluded
with
a
general
dance
by
upwards
of
two
hundred
torches
of
dried
canes
each
of
the
thickness
of
a
child
are
lighted
round
the
place
where
the
men
and
women
often
continue
dancing
till
daylight
and
the
following
is
the
disposition
of
their
dance
a
man
places
himself
on
the
ground
with
a
pot
covered
with
a
in
the
manner
of
a
drum
to
beat
time
to
the
dancers
round
him
the
women
form
themselves
into
a
circle
not
joining
hands
but
at
some
distance
from
each
other
and
they
are
inclosed
by
the
men
in
another
circle
who
have
in
each
hand
a
chichicois
or
calabash
with
a
stick
thrust
through
it
to
serve
for
a
handle
when
the
dance
begins
the
women
move
round
the
men
in
the
centre
from
left
to
right
and
the
men
contrariwise
from
right
to
left
and
they
sometimes
narrow
and
sometimes
widen
their
circles
in
this
manner
the
dance
continues
without
intermission
the
whole
night
new
performers
successively
taking
the
place
of
those
who
are
wearied
and
fatigued
next
morning
no
person
is
seen
abroad
before
the
great
sun
comes
out
of
his
hut
which
is
generally
about
nine
o
clock
and
then
upon
a
signal
made
by
the
drum
the
warriors
make
their
appearance
distinguished
into
two
troops
by
the
feathers
which
they
wear
on
their
heads
one
of
these
troops
is
headed
by
the
great
sun
and
the
other
by
the
chief
of
war
who
begin
a
new
diversion
by
tossing
a
ball
of
stuffed
with
spanish
beard
from
the
one
to
the
other
the
warriors
quickly
take
part
in
the
sport
and
a
violent
contest
ensues
which
of
the
two
parties
shall
drive
the
ball
to
the
hut
of
the
opposite
chief
the
diversion
generally
lasts
two
hours
and
the
victors
are
allowed
to
wear
the
feathers
of
superiority
till
the
following
year
or
till
the
next
time
they
play
at
the
ball
after
this
the
warriors
perform
the
war
dance
and
last
of
all
they
go
and
bathe
an
exercise
which
they
are
very
fond
of
when
they
are
heated
or
fatigued
the
rest
of
that
day
is
employed
as
the
preceding
for
the
feast
holds
as
long
as
any
of
the
corn
remains
when
it
is
all
eat
up
the
great
sun
is
carried
back
in
his
litter
and
they
all
return
to
the
village
after
which
he
sends
the
warriors
to
hunt
both
for
themselves
and
even
tribes
which
do
not
till
the
ground
sometimes
observe
analogous
ceremonies
when
they
gather
the
first
wild
fruits
or
dig
the
first
roots
of
the
season
thus
among
the
salish
and
tinneh
indians
of
america
before
the
young
people
eat
the
first
berries
or
roots
of
the
season
they
always
addressed
the
fruit
or
plant
and
begged
for
its
favour
and
aid
in
some
tribes
regular
ceremonies
were
annually
held
at
the
time
of
picking
the
wild
fruit
or
gathering
the
roots
and
also
among
the
tribes
when
the
run
of
the
sockeye
salmon
began
these
ceremonies
were
not
so
much
thanksgivings
as
performances
to
ensure
a
plentiful
crop
or
supply
of
the
particular
object
desired
for
if
they
were
not
properly
and
reverently
carried
out
there
was
danger
of
giving
offence
to
the
spirits
of
the
objects
and
being
deprived
of
for
example
these
indians
are
fond
of
the
young
shoots
or
suckers
of
the
wild
raspberry
and
they
observe
the
following
ceremony
at
gathering
the
first
of
them
in
season
when
the
shoots
are
ready
to
pick
that
is
when
they
are
about
six
or
eight
inches
above
the
ground
the
chief
or
directing
elder
of
the
community
instructs
his
wife
or
his
daughters
to
pluck
a
small
bundle
of
these
and
prepare
them
for
eating
this
they
do
using
a
new
pot
or
kettle
for
cooking
them
in
in
the
meantime
all
the
settlement
comes
together
to
take
part
in
the
ceremony
they
stand
in
a
great
circle
the
presiding
chief
elder
or
as
the
case
may
be
and
his
assistants
being
in
their
midst
whoever
is
conducting
the
ceremony
now
silently
invokes
the
spirit
of
the
plants
the
tenor
of
his
prayer
being
that
it
will
be
propitious
to
them
and
grant
them
a
good
supply
of
the
suckers
while
the
invocation
is
being
made
all
in
the
circle
must
keep
their
eyes
reverently
closed
this
being
an
essential
part
in
all
such
ceremonies
the
of
which
would
anger
the
spirits
and
cause
them
to
withhold
the
favours
sought
to
ensure
this
being
strictly
done
the
assisting
elders
are
armed
with
long
wands
with
which
they
strike
any
person
found
opening
his
eyes
during
the
prayer
after
this
part
of
the
ceremony
is
over
the
cooked
suckers
are
handed
to
the
presiding
officer
in
a
newly
carved
dish
and
a
small
portion
is
given
to
each
person
present
who
reverently
and
decorously
eats
it
this
brings
the
ceremony
to
a
close
later
when
the
berries
of
this
plant
are
ripe
a
second
and
similar
ceremony
takes
the
thompson
indians
of
british
columbia
cook
and
eat
the
sunflower
root
nutt
but
they
used
to
regard
it
as
a
mysterious
being
and
observed
a
number
of
taboos
in
connexion
with
it
for
example
women
who
were
engaged
in
digging
or
cooking
the
root
must
practise
continence
and
no
man
might
come
near
the
oven
where
the
women
were
baking
the
root
when
young
people
ate
the
first
berries
roots
or
other
products
of
the
season
they
addressed
a
prayer
to
the
as
follows
i
inform
thee
that
i
intend
to
eat
thee
mayest
thou
always
help
me
to
ascend
so
that
i
may
always
be
able
to
reach
the
tops
of
mountains
and
may
i
never
be
clumsy
i
ask
this
from
thee
thou
art
the
greatest
of
all
in
to
omit
this
prayer
would
make
the
eater
lazy
and
cause
him
to
sleep
long
in
the
morning
again
when
the
first
tobacco
of
the
season
was
gathered
and
smoked
for
the
first
time
the
inhabitants
of
each
lodge
among
the
thompson
indians
observed
the
following
ceremony
an
elderly
man
assembled
all
the
inmates
often
outside
the
lodge
and
generally
after
sunset
and
caused
all
the
adult
men
and
women
who
were
in
the
habit
of
smoking
to
sit
down
in
a
circle
while
he
stood
in
the
middle
sometimes
he
made
a
long
speech
to
the
people
but
as
a
rule
he
simply
said
be
it
known
to
you
that
we
will
cut
up
the
chief
meaning
by
the
chief
the
tobacco
so
saying
he
cut
up
some
of
the
tobacco
and
after
mixing
it
with
leaves
he
filled
a
large
pipe
lighted
it
and
handed
it
to
each
person
following
the
sun
s
course
everybody
took
one
whiff
and
holding
up
his
or
her
hands
the
palms
close
together
blew
the
smoke
downwards
between
the
fingers
and
over
the
breast
and
as
the
smoke
descended
he
crossed
his
hands
on
his
breast
and
rubbing
his
chest
and
shoulders
with
both
hands
as
if
he
were
rubbing
the
smoke
in
he
prayed
lengthen
my
breath
chief
so
that
i
may
never
be
sick
and
so
that
i
may
not
die
for
a
long
time
to
by
the
chief
he
meant
the
tobacco
when
every
one
had
had
his
whiff
the
tobacco
was
cut
up
small
and
a
piece
given
to
each
person
these
customs
of
the
thompson
and
other
indian
tribes
of
america
are
instructive
because
they
clearly
indicate
the
motive
or
at
least
one
of
the
motives
which
underlies
the
ceremonies
observed
at
eating
the
first
fruits
of
the
season
that
motive
in
the
case
of
these
indians
is
simply
a
belief
that
the
plant
itself
is
animated
by
a
conscious
and
more
or
less
powerful
spirit
who
must
be
propitiated
before
the
people
can
safely
partake
of
the
fruits
or
roots
which
are
supposed
to
be
part
of
his
body
now
if
this
is
true
of
wild
fruits
and
roots
we
may
infer
with
some
probability
that
it
is
also
true
of
cultivated
fruits
and
roots
such
as
yams
and
in
particular
that
it
holds
good
of
the
cereals
such
as
wheat
barley
oats
rice
and
maize
in
all
cases
it
seems
reasonable
to
infer
that
the
scruples
which
savages
manifest
at
eating
the
first
fruits
of
any
crop
and
the
ceremonies
which
they
observe
before
they
overcome
their
scruples
are
due
at
least
in
large
measure
to
a
notion
that
the
plant
or
tree
is
animated
by
a
spirit
or
even
a
deity
whose
leave
must
be
obtained
or
whose
favour
must
be
sought
before
it
is
possible
to
partake
with
safety
of
the
new
crop
this
indeed
is
plainly
affirmed
of
the
aino
they
call
the
millet
the
divine
cereal
the
cereal
deity
and
they
pray
to
and
worship
him
before
they
will
eat
of
the
cakes
made
from
the
new
millet
and
even
where
the
indwelling
divinity
of
the
first
fruits
is
not
expressly
affirmed
it
appears
to
be
implied
both
by
the
solemn
preparations
made
for
eating
them
and
by
the
danger
supposed
to
be
incurred
by
persons
who
venture
to
partake
of
them
without
observing
the
prescribed
ritual
in
all
such
cases
accordingly
we
may
not
improperly
describe
the
eating
of
the
new
fruits
as
a
sacrament
or
communion
with
a
deity
or
at
all
events
with
a
powerful
spirit
among
the
usages
which
point
to
this
conclusion
are
the
custom
of
employing
either
new
or
specially
reserved
vessels
to
hold
the
new
fruits
and
the
practice
of
purifying
the
persons
of
the
communicants
and
even
the
houses
and
streets
of
the
whole
town
before
it
is
lawful
to
engage
in
the
solemn
act
of
communion
with
the
divinity
of
all
the
modes
of
purification
adopted
on
these
occasions
none
perhaps
brings
out
the
sacramental
virtue
of
the
rite
so
clearly
as
the
creek
and
seminole
practice
of
taking
a
purgative
before
swallowing
the
new
corn
the
intention
is
thereby
to
prevent
the
sacred
food
from
being
polluted
by
contact
with
common
food
in
the
stomach
of
the
eater
for
the
same
reason
catholics
partake
of
the
eucharist
fasting
and
among
the
pastoral
masai
of
eastern
africa
the
young
warriors
who
live
on
meat
and
milk
exclusively
are
obliged
to
eat
nothing
but
milk
for
so
many
days
and
then
nothing
but
meat
for
so
many
more
and
before
they
pass
from
the
one
food
to
the
other
they
must
make
sure
that
none
of
the
old
food
remains
in
their
stomachs
this
they
do
by
swallowing
a
very
powerful
purgative
and
emetic
similarly
among
the
suk
a
tribe
of
british
east
africa
no
one
may
partake
of
meat
and
milk
on
the
same
day
and
if
he
has
chewed
raw
millet
he
is
forbidden
to
drink
milk
for
seven
days
among
the
wataturu
another
people
of
eastern
africa
akin
to
the
masai
a
warrior
who
had
eaten
antelope
s
flesh
might
not
drink
of
milk
on
the
same
day
similarly
among
the
central
esquimaux
the
rules
prohibiting
contact
between
venison
and
the
flesh
of
marine
animals
are
very
strict
the
esquimaux
themselves
say
that
the
goddess
sedna
dislikes
the
deer
and
therefore
they
may
not
bring
that
animal
into
contact
with
her
favourites
the
sea
beasts
hence
the
meat
of
the
whale
the
seal
or
the
walrus
may
not
be
eaten
on
the
same
day
with
venison
both
sorts
of
meat
may
not
even
lie
on
the
floor
of
the
hut
or
behind
the
lamps
at
the
same
time
if
a
man
who
has
eaten
venison
in
the
morning
happens
to
enter
a
hut
in
which
the
flesh
of
seal
is
being
cooked
he
is
allowed
to
eat
venison
on
the
bed
but
it
must
be
wrapt
up
before
being
carried
into
the
hut
and
he
must
take
care
to
keep
clear
of
the
floor
before
changing
from
one
food
to
the
other
the
esquimaux
must
wash
themselves
again
just
as
the
esquimaux
think
that
their
goddess
would
be
offended
if
venison
met
seal
or
whale
or
walrus
meat
in
the
eater
s
stomach
so
the
melanesians
of
florida
one
of
the
solomon
islands
believe
that
if
a
man
who
has
eaten
pork
or
fish
or
or
the
flesh
of
a
certain
sort
of
cuscus
were
to
enter
a
garden
immediately
afterwards
the
ghosts
who
preside
over
the
garden
and
cause
the
fruits
to
grow
would
be
angry
and
the
crop
would
consequently
suffer
but
three
or
four
days
after
partaking
of
such
victuals
when
the
food
has
quite
left
his
stomach
he
may
enter
the
garden
without
offence
to
the
ghosts
or
injury
to
the
crop
in
like
manner
the
ancient
greeks
of
whose
intellectual
kinship
with
savages
like
the
esquimaux
and
the
melanesians
we
have
already
met
with
many
proofs
laid
it
down
as
a
rule
that
a
man
who
had
partaken
of
the
black
ram
offered
to
pelops
at
olympia
might
not
enter
into
the
temple
of
zeus
and
that
persons
who
had
sacrificed
to
telephus
at
pergamus
might
not
go
up
to
the
temple
of
aesculapius
until
they
had
washed
themselves
just
as
the
esquimaux
who
have
eaten
venison
must
wash
before
they
may
partake
of
seal
or
whale
or
walrus
meat
again
at
lindus
in
rhodes
there
was
a
sanctuary
of
some
god
or
hero
unknown
into
which
no
one
who
had
partaken
of
goat
s
flesh
or
might
enter
for
three
days
and
no
one
who
had
eaten
cheese
might
enter
for
one
day
the
prescribed
interval
was
probably
calculated
to
allow
the
obnoxious
food
to
pass
out
of
the
body
of
the
eater
before
he
entered
into
the
presence
of
the
deity
who
for
some
reason
or
other
cherished
an
antipathy
to
these
particular
viands
at
castabus
in
the
carian
chersonese
there
was
a
sanctuary
of
hemithea
which
no
one
might
approach
who
had
either
eaten
pork
or
touched
a
pig
in
some
of
the
festivals
which
we
have
examined
as
in
the
cheremiss
buru
cham
ewe
and
creek
ceremonies
the
sacrament
of
is
combined
with
a
sacrifice
or
presentation
of
them
to
gods
or
spirits
and
in
course
of
time
the
sacrifice
of
tends
to
throw
the
sacrament
into
the
shade
if
not
to
supersede
it
the
mere
fact
of
offering
the
to
the
gods
or
spirits
comes
now
to
be
thought
a
sufficient
preparation
for
eating
the
new
corn
the
higher
powers
having
received
their
share
man
is
free
to
enjoy
the
rest
this
mode
of
viewing
the
new
fruits
implies
that
they
are
regarded
no
longer
as
themselves
instinct
with
divine
life
but
merely
as
a
gift
bestowed
by
the
gods
upon
man
who
is
bound
to
express
his
gratitude
and
homage
to
his
divine
benefactors
by
returning
to
them
a
portion
of
their
bounty
more
examples
of
the
sacrifice
as
distinct
from
sacrament
of
will
be
given
presently
eating
the
god
among
the
aztecs
the
custom
of
eating
bread
sacramentally
as
the
body
of
a
god
was
practised
by
the
aztecs
before
the
discovery
and
conquest
of
mexico
by
the
spaniards
twice
a
year
in
may
and
december
an
image
of
the
great
mexican
god
huitzilopochtli
or
vitzilipuztli
was
made
of
dough
then
broken
in
pieces
and
solemnly
eaten
by
his
worshippers
the
may
ceremony
is
thus
described
by
the
historian
acosta
the
mexicans
in
the
month
of
may
made
their
principal
feast
to
their
god
vitzilipuztli
and
two
days
before
this
feast
the
virgins
whereof
i
have
spoken
the
which
were
shut
up
and
secluded
in
the
same
temple
and
were
as
it
were
religious
women
did
mingle
a
quantity
of
the
seed
of
beets
with
roasted
maize
and
then
they
did
mould
it
with
honey
making
an
idol
of
that
paste
in
bigness
like
to
that
of
wood
putting
instead
of
eyes
grains
of
green
glass
of
blue
or
white
and
for
teeth
grains
of
maize
set
forth
with
all
the
ornament
and
furniture
that
i
have
said
this
being
finished
all
the
noblemen
came
and
brought
it
an
exquisite
and
rich
garment
like
unto
that
of
the
idol
wherewith
they
did
attire
it
being
thus
clad
and
deckt
they
did
set
it
in
an
azured
chair
and
in
a
litter
to
carry
it
on
their
shoulders
the
morning
of
this
feast
being
come
an
hour
before
day
all
the
maidens
came
forth
attired
in
white
with
new
ornaments
the
which
that
day
were
called
the
sisters
of
their
god
vitzilipuztli
they
came
crowned
with
garlands
of
maize
roasted
and
parched
being
like
unto
azahar
or
the
flower
of
orange
and
about
their
necks
they
had
great
chains
of
the
same
which
went
bauldrickwise
under
their
left
arm
their
cheeks
were
dyed
with
vermilion
their
arms
from
the
elbow
to
the
wrist
were
covered
with
red
parrots
young
men
dressed
in
red
robes
and
crowned
like
the
virgins
with
maize
then
carried
the
idol
in
its
litter
to
the
foot
of
the
great
temple
up
the
steep
and
narrow
steps
of
which
it
was
drawn
to
the
music
of
flutes
trumpets
cornets
and
drums
while
they
mounted
up
the
idol
all
the
people
stood
in
the
court
with
much
reverence
and
fear
being
mounted
to
the
top
and
that
they
had
placed
it
in
a
little
lodge
of
roses
which
they
held
ready
presently
came
the
young
men
which
strewed
many
flowers
of
sundry
kinds
wherewith
they
filled
the
temple
both
within
and
without
this
done
all
the
virgins
came
out
of
their
convent
bringing
pieces
of
paste
compounded
of
beets
and
roasted
maize
which
was
of
the
same
paste
whereof
their
idol
was
made
and
compounded
and
they
were
of
the
fashion
of
great
bones
they
delivered
them
to
the
young
men
who
carried
them
up
and
laid
them
at
the
idol
s
feet
wherewith
they
filled
the
whole
place
that
it
could
receive
no
more
they
called
these
morsels
of
paste
the
flesh
and
bones
of
vitzilipuztli
having
laid
abroad
these
bones
presently
came
all
the
ancients
of
the
temple
priests
levites
and
all
the
rest
of
the
ministers
according
to
their
dignities
and
antiquities
for
herein
there
was
a
strict
order
amongst
them
one
after
another
with
their
veils
of
diverse
colours
and
works
every
one
according
to
his
dignity
and
office
having
garlands
upon
their
heads
and
chains
of
flowers
about
their
necks
after
them
came
their
gods
and
goddesses
whom
they
worshipped
of
diverse
figures
attired
in
the
same
livery
then
putting
themselves
in
order
about
those
morsels
and
pieces
of
paste
they
used
certain
ceremonies
with
singing
and
dancing
by
means
whereof
they
were
blessed
and
consecrated
for
the
flesh
and
bones
of
this
idol
this
ceremony
and
blessing
whereby
they
were
taken
for
the
flesh
and
bones
of
the
idol
being
ended
they
honoured
those
pieces
in
the
same
sort
as
their
god
then
come
forth
the
sacrificers
who
began
the
sacrifice
of
men
in
the
manner
as
hath
been
spoken
and
that
day
they
did
sacrifice
a
greater
number
than
at
any
other
time
for
that
it
was
the
most
solemn
feast
they
observed
the
sacrifices
being
ended
all
the
young
men
and
maids
came
out
of
the
temple
attired
as
before
and
being
placed
in
order
and
rank
one
directly
against
another
they
danced
by
drums
the
which
sounded
in
praise
of
the
feast
and
of
the
idol
which
they
did
celebrate
to
which
song
all
the
most
ancient
and
greatest
noblemen
did
answer
dancing
about
them
making
a
great
circle
as
their
use
is
the
young
men
and
maids
remaining
always
in
the
midst
all
the
city
came
to
this
goodly
spectacle
and
there
was
a
commandment
very
strictly
observed
throughout
all
the
land
that
the
day
of
the
feast
of
the
idol
of
vitzilipuztli
they
should
eat
no
other
meat
but
this
paste
with
honey
whereof
the
idol
was
made
and
this
should
be
eaten
at
the
point
of
day
and
they
should
drink
no
water
nor
any
other
thing
till
after
noon
they
held
it
for
an
ill
sign
yea
for
sacrilege
to
do
the
contrary
but
after
the
ceremonies
ended
it
was
lawful
for
them
to
eat
anything
during
the
time
of
this
ceremony
they
hid
the
water
from
their
little
children
admonishing
all
such
as
had
the
use
of
reason
not
to
drink
any
water
which
if
they
did
the
anger
of
god
would
come
upon
them
and
they
should
die
which
they
did
observe
very
carefully
and
strictly
the
ceremonies
dancing
and
sacrifice
ended
they
went
to
unclothe
themselves
and
the
priests
and
superiors
of
the
temple
took
the
idol
of
paste
which
they
spoiled
of
all
the
ornaments
it
had
and
made
many
pieces
as
well
of
the
idol
itself
as
of
the
truncheons
which
they
consecrated
and
then
they
gave
them
to
the
people
in
manner
of
a
communion
beginning
with
the
greater
and
continuing
unto
the
rest
both
men
women
and
little
children
who
received
it
with
such
tears
fear
and
reverence
as
it
was
an
admirable
thing
saying
that
they
did
eat
the
flesh
and
bones
of
god
wherewith
they
were
grieved
such
as
had
any
sick
folks
demanded
thereof
for
them
and
carried
it
with
great
reverence
and
from
this
interesting
passage
we
learn
that
the
ancient
mexicans
even
before
the
arrival
of
christian
missionaries
were
fully
acquainted
with
the
theological
doctrine
of
transubstantiation
and
acted
upon
it
in
the
solemn
rites
of
their
religion
they
believed
that
by
consecrating
bread
their
priests
could
turn
it
into
the
very
body
of
their
god
so
that
all
who
thereupon
partook
of
the
consecrated
bread
entered
into
a
mystic
communion
with
the
deity
by
receiving
a
portion
of
his
divine
substance
into
themselves
the
doctrine
of
transubstantiation
or
the
magical
conversion
of
bread
into
flesh
was
also
familiar
to
the
aryans
of
ancient
india
long
before
the
spread
and
even
the
rise
of
christianity
the
brahmans
taught
that
the
offered
in
sacrifice
were
substitutes
for
human
beings
and
that
they
were
actually
converted
into
the
real
bodies
of
men
by
the
manipulation
of
the
priest
we
read
that
when
it
the
still
consists
of
it
is
the
hair
when
he
pours
water
on
it
it
becomes
skin
when
he
mixes
it
it
becomes
flesh
for
then
it
becomes
consistent
and
consistent
also
is
the
flesh
when
it
is
baked
it
becomes
bone
for
then
it
becomes
somewhat
hard
and
hard
is
the
bone
and
when
he
is
about
to
take
it
off
the
fire
and
sprinkles
it
with
butter
he
changes
it
into
marrow
this
is
the
completeness
which
they
call
the
fivefold
animal
these
remarkable
transformations
daily
wrought
by
the
priest
on
the
were
however
nothing
at
all
to
those
which
the
gods
themselves
accomplished
when
they
first
instituted
the
rite
for
the
horse
and
the
ox
which
they
sacrificed
became
a
and
a
gayal
respectively
the
sheep
was
turned
into
a
camel
and
the
goat
was
converted
into
a
remarkable
species
of
deer
enriched
with
eight
legs
which
slew
lions
and
elephants
on
the
whole
it
would
seem
that
neither
the
ancient
hindoos
nor
the
ancient
mexicans
had
much
to
learn
from
the
most
refined
mysteries
of
catholic
theology
now
too
we
can
perfectly
understand
why
on
the
day
of
their
solemn
communion
with
the
deity
the
mexicans
refused
to
eat
any
other
food
than
the
consecrated
bread
which
they
revered
as
the
very
flesh
and
bones
of
their
god
and
why
up
till
noon
they
might
drink
nothing
at
all
not
even
water
they
feared
no
doubt
to
defile
the
portion
of
god
in
their
stomachs
by
contact
with
common
things
a
similar
pious
fear
led
the
creek
and
seminole
indians
as
we
saw
to
adopt
the
more
thoroughgoing
expedient
of
rinsing
out
their
insides
by
a
strong
purgative
before
they
dared
to
partake
of
the
sacrament
of
we
can
now
also
conjecture
the
reason
why
zulu
boys
after
eating
the
flesh
of
the
black
bull
at
the
feast
of
are
forbidden
to
drink
anything
till
the
next
day
at
the
festival
of
the
winter
solstice
in
december
the
aztecs
killed
their
god
huitzilopochtli
in
effigy
first
and
ate
him
afterwards
as
a
preparation
for
this
solemn
ceremony
an
image
of
the
deity
in
the
likeness
of
a
man
was
fashioned
out
of
seeds
of
various
sorts
which
were
kneaded
into
a
dough
with
the
blood
of
children
the
bones
of
the
god
were
represented
by
pieces
of
acacia
wood
this
image
was
placed
on
the
chief
altar
of
the
temple
and
on
the
day
of
the
festival
the
king
offered
incense
to
it
early
next
day
it
was
taken
down
and
set
on
its
feet
in
a
great
hall
then
a
priest
who
bore
the
name
and
acted
the
part
of
the
god
quetzalcoatl
took
a
dart
and
hurled
it
into
the
breast
of
the
piercing
it
through
and
through
this
was
called
killing
the
god
huitzilopochtli
so
that
his
body
might
be
one
of
the
priests
cut
out
the
heart
of
the
image
and
gave
it
to
the
king
to
eat
the
rest
of
the
image
was
divided
into
minute
pieces
of
which
every
man
great
and
small
down
to
the
male
children
in
the
cradle
received
one
to
eat
but
no
woman
might
taste
a
morsel
the
ceremony
was
called
that
is
god
is
at
another
festival
the
mexicans
made
little
images
like
men
which
stood
for
the
mountains
these
images
were
moulded
of
a
paste
of
various
seeds
and
were
dressed
in
paper
ornaments
some
people
fashioned
five
others
ten
others
as
many
as
fifteen
of
them
having
been
made
they
were
placed
in
the
oratory
of
each
house
and
worshipped
four
times
in
the
course
of
the
night
offerings
of
food
were
brought
to
them
in
tiny
vessels
and
people
sang
and
played
the
flute
before
them
through
all
the
hours
of
darkness
at
break
of
day
the
priests
stabbed
the
images
with
a
weaver
s
instrument
cut
off
their
heads
and
tore
out
their
hearts
which
they
presented
to
the
master
of
the
house
on
a
green
saucer
the
bodies
of
the
images
were
then
eaten
by
all
the
family
especially
by
the
servants
in
order
that
by
eating
them
they
might
be
preserved
from
certain
distempers
to
which
those
persons
who
were
negligent
of
worship
to
those
deities
conceived
themselves
to
be
in
some
cities
of
mexico
as
in
tlacopan
and
coyohuacan
an
idol
was
fashioned
out
of
grains
of
various
kinds
and
the
warriors
ate
it
in
the
belief
that
the
sacred
food
would
increase
their
forces
fourfold
when
they
marched
to
the
fight
at
certain
festivals
held
thrice
a
year
in
nicaragua
all
the
men
beginning
with
the
priests
and
chiefs
drew
blood
from
their
tongues
and
genital
organs
with
sharp
knives
of
flint
allowed
it
to
drip
on
some
sheaves
of
maize
and
then
ate
the
bloody
grain
as
a
blessed
food
but
the
mexicans
did
not
always
content
themselves
with
eating
their
gods
in
the
outward
and
visible
shape
of
bread
or
grain
it
was
not
even
enough
that
this
material
vehicle
of
the
divine
life
should
be
kneaded
and
fortified
with
human
blood
they
craved
as
it
seems
after
a
closer
union
with
the
living
god
and
attained
it
by
devouring
the
flesh
of
a
real
man
who
after
he
had
paraded
for
a
time
in
the
trappings
and
received
the
honours
of
a
god
was
slaughtered
and
eaten
by
his
cannibal
worshippers
the
deity
thus
consumed
in
effigy
was
tetzcatlipoca
and
the
man
chosen
to
represent
him
and
die
in
his
stead
was
a
young
captive
of
handsome
person
and
illustrious
birth
during
his
captivity
the
youth
thus
doomed
to
play
the
fatal
part
of
divinity
was
allowed
to
range
the
streets
of
mexico
freely
escorted
by
a
distinguished
train
who
paid
him
as
much
respect
as
if
he
had
been
indeed
the
god
himself
instead
of
only
his
living
image
twenty
days
before
the
festival
at
which
the
tragic
mockery
was
to
end
that
he
might
taste
all
the
joys
of
this
transient
world
to
which
he
must
soon
bid
farewell
he
received
in
marriage
four
women
from
whom
he
parted
only
when
he
took
his
place
in
the
last
solemn
procession
arrived
at
the
foot
of
the
sacred
pyramid
on
the
top
of
which
he
was
to
die
the
sacrificers
saluted
him
and
led
him
up
the
long
staircase
on
the
summit
five
of
them
seized
him
and
held
him
down
on
his
back
upon
the
sacrificial
stone
while
the
high
priest
after
bowing
to
the
god
he
was
about
to
kill
cut
open
his
breast
and
tore
out
the
throbbing
heart
with
the
accustomed
rites
but
instead
of
being
kicked
down
the
staircase
and
sent
rolling
from
step
to
step
like
the
corpses
of
common
victims
the
body
of
the
dead
god
was
carried
respectfully
down
and
his
flesh
chopped
up
small
was
distributed
among
the
priests
and
nobles
as
a
blessed
food
the
head
being
severed
from
the
trunk
was
preserved
in
a
sacred
place
along
with
the
white
and
grinning
skulls
of
all
the
other
victims
who
had
lived
and
died
in
the
character
of
the
god
tetzcatlipoca
the
custom
of
entering
into
communion
with
a
god
by
eating
of
his
effigy
survived
till
lately
among
the
huichol
indians
of
mexico
in
a
narrow
valley
at
the
foot
of
a
beetling
crag
of
red
rock
they
have
a
small
thatched
temple
of
the
god
of
fire
and
here
down
to
recent
years
stood
a
small
image
of
the
deity
in
human
form
roughly
carved
out
of
solidified
volcanic
ash
the
idol
was
very
dirty
and
smeared
with
blood
and
in
his
right
side
was
a
hole
which
owed
its
existence
to
the
piety
and
devotion
of
his
worshippers
for
they
believed
that
the
power
of
healing
and
a
knowledge
of
mysteries
could
be
acquired
by
eating
a
little
of
the
god
s
holy
body
and
accordingly
shamans
or
who
desired
to
lay
in
a
stock
of
these
accomplishments
so
useful
in
the
exercise
of
their
profession
were
wont
to
repair
to
the
temple
where
having
deposited
an
offering
of
food
or
a
votive
bowl
they
scraped
off
with
their
some
particles
of
the
god
s
body
and
swallowed
them
after
engaging
in
this
form
of
communion
with
the
deity
they
had
to
abstain
from
salt
and
from
all
carnal
converse
with
their
wives
for
five
months

it
in
pieces
and
distributing
the
pieces
among
themselves

swallow
them
in
this
way
they
are
no
doubt
believed
to
absorb
the
divine
essence
of
the
goddess
whose
broken
body
has
just
passed
into
their
stomachs
in
europe
the
catholic
church
has
resorted
to
similar
means
for
enabling
the
pious
to
enjoy
the
ineffable
privilege
of
eating
the
persons
of
the
infant
god
and
his
mother
for
this
purpose
images
of
the
madonna
are
printed
on
some
soluble
and
harmless
substance
and
sold
in
sheets
like
postage
stamps
the
worshipper
buys
as
many
of
these
sacred
emblems
as
he
has
occasion
for
and
affixing
one
or
more
of
them
to
his
food

practice
is
not
confined
to

poor
and
ignorant
in

youth

and
his
devout
mother
used
thus
to
consume
portions
of
god
and
his
mother
with
their
meals
many
manii
at
aricia
we
are
now
able
to
suggest
an
explanation
of
the
proverb
there
are
many
manii
at
certain
loaves
made
in
the
shape
of
men
were
called
by
the
romans
and
it
appears
that
this
kind
of
loaf
was
especially
made
at
aricia
now
mania
the
name
of
one
of
these
loaves
was
also
the
name
of
the
mother
or
grandmother
of
ghosts
to
whom
woollen
effigies
of
men
and
women
were
dedicated
at
the
festival
of
the
compitalia
these
effigies
were
hung
at
the
doors
of
all
the
houses
in
rome
one
effigy
was
hung
up
for
every
free
person
in
the
house
and
one
effigy
of
a
different
kind
for
every
slave
the
reason
was
that
on
this
day
the
ghosts
of
the
dead
were
believed
to
be
going
about
and
it
was
hoped
that
either
out
of
good
nature
or
through
simple
inadvertence
they
would
carry
off
the
effigies
at
the
door
instead
of
the
living
people
in
the
house
according
to
tradition
these
woollen
figures
were
substitutes
for
a
former
custom
of
sacrificing
human
beings
upon
data
so
fragmentary
and
uncertain
it
is
impossible
to
build
with
confidence
but
it
seems
worth
suggesting
that
the
loaves
in
human
form
which
appear
to
have
been
baked
at
aricia
were
sacramental
bread
and
that
in
the
old
days
when
the
divine
king
of
the
wood
was
annually
slain
loaves
were
made
in
his
image
like
the
paste
figures
of
the
gods
in
mexico
india
and
europe
and
were
eaten
sacramentally
by
his
worshippers
the
mexican
sacraments
in
honour
of
huitzilopochtli
were
also
accompanied
by
the
sacrifice
of
human
victims
the
tradition
that
the
founder
of
the
sacred
grove
at
aricia
was
a
man
named
manius
from
whom
many
manii
were
descended
would
thus
be
an
etymological
myth
invented
to
explain
the
name
as
applied
to
these
sacramental
loaves
a
dim
recollection
of
the
original
connexion
of
the
loaves
with
human
sacrifices
may
perhaps
be
traced
in
the
story
that
the
effigies
dedicated
to
mania
at
the
compitalia
were
substitutes
for
human
victims
the
story
itself
however
is
probably
devoid
of
foundation
since
the
practice
of
putting
up
dummies
to
divert
the
attention
of
ghosts
or
demons
from
living
people
is
not
uncommon
as
the
practice
is
both
widely
spread
and
very
characteristic
of
the
manner
of
thought
of
primitive
man
who
tries
in
a
thousand
ways
to
outwit
the
malice
of
spiritual
beings
i
may
be
pardoned
for
devoting
a
few
pages
to
its
illustration
even
though
in
doing
so
i
diverge
somewhat
from
the
strict
line
of
argument
i
would
ask
the
reader
to
observe
that
the
vicarious
use
of
images
with
which
we
are
here
concerned
differs
wholly
in
principle
from
the
sympathetic
use
of
them
which
we
examined
before
and
that
while
the
sympathetic
use
belongs
purely
to
magic
the
vicarious
use
falls
within
the
domain
of
religion
the
tibetans
stand
in
fear
of
innumerable
all
of
whom
are
under
the
authority
of
old
mother
this
goddess
who
may
be
compared
to
the
roman
mania
the
mother
or
grandmother
of
ghosts
is
dressed
in
robes
holds
a
golden
noose
in
her
hand
and
rides
on
a
ram
in
order
to
bar
the
against
the
foul
fiends
of
whom
old
mother
is
mistress
an
elaborate
structure
somewhat
resembling
a
chandelier
is
fixed
above
the
door
on
the
outside
of
the
house
it
contains
a
ram
s
skull
a
variety
of
precious
objects
such
as
silver
and
turquoise
also
some
dry
food
such
as
rice
wheat
and
pulse
and
finally
images
or
pictures
of
a
man
a
woman
and
a
house
the
object
of
these
figures
of
a
man
wife
and
house
is
to
deceive
the
demons
should
they
still
come
in
spite
of
this
offering
and
to
mislead
them
into
the
belief
that
the
foregoing
pictures
are
the
inmates
of
the
house
so
that
they
may
wreak
their
wrath
on
these
bits
of
wood
and
so
save
the
real
human
when
all
is
ready
a
priest
prays
to
old
mother
that
she
would
be
pleased
to
accept
these
dainty
offerings
and
to
close
the
open
doors
of
the
earth
in
order
that
the
demons
may
not
come
forth
to
infest
and
injure
the
household
further
it
is
often
supposed
that
the
spirits
of
persons
who
have
recently
departed
this
life
are
apt
to
carry
off
with
them
to
the
world
of
the
dead
the
souls
of
their
surviving
relations
hence
the
savage
resorts
to
the
device
of
making
up
of
dummies
or
effigies
which
he
puts
in
the
way
of
the
ghost
hoping
that
the
spirit
will
mistake
them
for
real
people
and
so
leave
the
survivors
in
peace
hence
in
tahiti
the
priest
who
performed
the
funeral
rites
used
to
lay
some
slips
of
plantain
on
the
breast
and
under
the
arms
of
the
corpse
saying
there
are
your
family
there
is
your
child
there
is
your
wife
there
is
your
father
and
there
is
your
mother
be
satisfied
yonder
that
is
in
the
world
of
spirits
look
not
towards
those
who
are
left
in
the
this
ceremony
we
are
told
was
designed
to
impart
contentment
to
the
departed
and
to
prevent
the
spirit
from
repairing
to
the
places
of
his
former
resort
and
so
distressing
the
when
the
galelareese
bury
a
corpse
they
bury
with
it
the
stem
of
a
for
company
in
order
that
the
dead
person
may
not
seek
a
companion
among
the
living
just
as
the
coffin
is
being
lowered
into
the
earth
one
of
the
bystanders
steps
up
and
throws
a
young
into
the
grave
saying
friend
you
must
miss
your
companions
of
this
earth
here
take
this
as

melanesia
the
ghost
of
a
woman
who
has
died
in

can
not
go
away
to
panoi
or
if
her
child
lives
for
she
can
not
leave
the
baby
behind
hence
to
bilk
her
ghost
they
tie
up
a
piece
of
loosely
in
leaves
and
lay
it
on
her
bosom
in
the
grave
so
away
she
goes
thinking
she
has
her
baby
with
her
and
as
she
goes
the
keeps
slipping
about
in
the
leaves
and
she
fancies
it
is
the
child
stirring
at
her
breast
thus
she
is
happy
till
she
comes
to
and
finds
she
has
been
deceived
for
a
baby
of
can
not
pass

among
the
ghosts
so
back
she
comes
tearing
in
grief
and
rage
to
look
for
the
child
but
meantime
the
infant
has
been
artfully
removed
to
another
house
where
the
dead
mother
can
not
find
it
though
she
looks
for
it
everywhere
in
the
pelew
islands
when
a
woman
has
died
in
childbed
her
spirit
comes
and
cries
give
me
the

so
to
beguile
her
they
bury
the
stem
of
a
young
with
her
body
cutting
it
short
and
laying
it
between
her
right
arm
and
her
breast
the
same
device
is
adopted
for
the
same
purpose
in
the
island
of
timor
in
like
circumstances
negroes
of
the
niger
delta
force
a
piece
of
the
stem
of
a
plantain
into
the
womb
of
the
dead
mother
in
order
to
make
her
think
that
she
has
her
babe
with
her
and
so
to
prevent
her
spirit
from
coming
back
to
claim
the
living
child
among
the
yorubas
of
west
africa
when
one
of
twins
dies
the
mother
carries
about
along
with
the
surviving
child
a
small
wooden
figure
roughly
fashioned
in
human
shape
and
of
the
sex
of
the
dead
twin
this
figure
is
intended
not
merely
to
keep
the
live
child
from
pining
for
its
lost
comrade
but
also
to
give
the
spirit
of
the
dead
child
something
into
which
it
can
enter
without
disturbing
its
little
brother
or
sister
among
the
tschwi
of
west
africa
a
lady
observed
a
sickly
child
with
an
image
beside
it
which
she
took
for
a
doll
but
it
was
no
doll
it
was
an
effigy
of
the
child
s
dead
twin
which
was
being
kept
near
the
survivor
as
a
habitation
for
the
little
ghost
lest
it
should
wander
homeless
and
feeling
lonely
call
its
companion
away
after
it
along
the
dark
road
of
death
at
onitsha
a
town
on
the
left
bank
of
the
niger
a
missionary
once
met
a
funeral
procession
which
he
describes
as
very
singular
the
real
body
had
already
been
buried
in
the
house
but
a
piece
of
wood
in
the
form
of
a
sofa
and
covered
up
was
being
borne
by
two
persons
on
their
heads
attended
by
a
procession
of
six
men
and
six
women
the
men
carried
cutlasses
and
the
women
clapped
their
hands
as
they
passed
along
each
street
crying
this
is
the
dead
body
of
him
that
is
dead
and
is
gone
into
the
world
of
meantime
the
rest
of
the
villagers
had
to
keep
indoors
the
sham
corpse
was
probably
intended
as
a
lure
to
draw
away
prowling
demons
from
the
real
body
so
among
the
angoni
who
inhabit
the
western
bank
of
lake
nyassa
there
is
a
common
belief
that
demons
hover
about
the
dying
and
dead
before
burial
in
order
to
snatch
away
their
souls
to
join
their
own
evil
order
guns
are
fired
and
drums
are
beaten
to
repel
these
spiritual
foes
but
a
surer
way
of
baulking
their
machinations
is
to
have
a
mock
funeral
and
so
mislead
and
confound
them
a
sham
corpse
is
made
up
out
of
anything
that
comes
to
hand
and
it
is
treated
exactly
as
if
it
were
what
it
pretends
to
be
this
lay
figure
is
then
carried
some
distance
to
a
grave
followed
by
a
great
crowd
weeping
and
wailing
as
if
their
hearts
would
break
while
the
of
drums
and
the
discharge
of
guns
add
to
the
uproar
meantime
the
real
corpse
is
being
interred
as
quietly
and
stealthily
as
possible
near
the
house
thus
the
demons
are
baffled
for
when
the
dummy
corpse
has
been
laid
in
the
earth
with
every
mark
of
respect
and
the
noisy
crowd
has
dispersed
the
fiends
swoop
down
on
the
mock
grave
only
to
find
a
bundle
of
rushes
or
some
such
trash
in
it
but
the
true
grave
they
do
not
know
and
can
not
find
similarly
among
the
bakundu
of
the
cameroons
two
graves
are
always
made
one
in
the
hut
of
the
deceased
and
another
somewhere
else
and
no
one
knows
where
the
corpse
is
really
buried
the
custom
is
apparently
intended
to
guard
the
knowledge
of
the
real
grave
from
demons
who
might
make
an
ill
use
of
the
body
if
not
of
the
soul
of
the
departed
in
like
manner
the
kamilaroi
tribe
of
australia
are
reported
to
make
two
graves
a
real
one
and
an
empty
one
for
the
purpose
of
cheating
a
malevolent
spirit
called
krooben
so
too
some
of
the
nagas
of
assam
dig
two
graves
a
sham
grave
made
conspicuous
on
purpose
to
attract
the
notice
of
the
evil
spirits
and
the
real
grave
made
inconspicuous
to
escape
their
attention
a
figure
is
set
up
over
the
false
grave
isis
is
said
to
have
made
many
false
graves
of
the
dead
osiris
in
egypt
in
order
that
his
foe
typhon
might
not
be
able
to
find
the
true
one
in
bombay
if
a
person
dies
on
an
unlucky
day
a
dough
figure
of
a
man
is
carried
on
the
bier
with
him
and
burnt
with
his
corpse
this
is
supposed
to
hinder
a
second
death
from
occurring
in
the
family
probably
because
the
demons
are
thought
to
take
the
dough
figure
instead
of
a
real
person
again
effigies
are
often
employed
as
a
means
of
preventing
or
curing
sickness
the
demons
of
disease
either
mistake
the
effigies
for
living
people
or
are
persuaded
or
compelled
to
enter
them
leaving
the
real
men
and
women
well
and
whole
thus
the
alfoors
of
minahassa
in
celebes
will
sometimes
transport
a
sick
man
to
another
house
while
they
leave
on
his
bed
a
dummy
made
up
of
a
pillow
and
clothes
this
dummy
the
demon
is
supposed
to
mistake
for
the
sick
man
who
consequently
recovers
cure
or
prevention
of
this
sort
seems
to
find
especial
favour
with
the
dyaks
of
borneo
thus
when
an
epidemic
is
raging
among
them
the
dyaks
of
the
katoengouw
river
set
up
wooden
images
at
their
doors
in
the
hope
that
the
demons
of
the
plague
may
be
deluded
into
carrying
off
the
effigies
instead
of
the
people
among
the
oloh
ngadju
of
borneo
when
a
sick
man
is
supposed
to
be
suffering
from
the
assaults
of
a
ghost
puppets
of
dough
or
are
made
and
thrown
under
the
house
as
substitutes
for
the
patient
who
thus
rids
himself
of
the
ghost
so
if
a
man
has
been
attacked
by
a
crocodile
and
has
contrived
to
escape
he
makes
a
puppet
of
dough
or
meal
and
casts
it
into
the
water
as
a
vicarious
offering
otherwise
the
who
is
conceived
in
the
shape
of
a
crocodile
might
be
angry
in
certain
of
the
western
districts
of
borneo
if
a
man
is
taken
suddenly
and
violently
sick
the
physician
who
in
this
part
of
the
world
is
generally
an
old
woman
fashions
a
wooden
image
and
brings
it
seven
times
into
contact
with
the
sufferer
s
head
while
she
says
this
image
serves
to
take
the
place
of
the
sick
man
sickness
pass
over
into
the
then
with
some
rice
salt
and
tobacco
in
a
little
basket
the
substitute
is
carried
to
the
spot
where
the
evil
spirit
is
supposed
to
have
entered
into
the
man
there
it
is
set
upright
on
the
ground
after
the
physician
has
invoked
the
spirit
as
follows
o
devil
here
is
an
image
which
stands
instead
of
the
sick
man
release
the
soul
of
the
sick
man
and
plague
the
image
for
it
is
indeed
prettier
and
better
than
similar
substitutes
are
used
almost
daily
by
these
dyaks
for
the
purpose
of
drawing
off
evil
influences
from
anybody
s
person
thus
when
an
ot
danom
baby
will
not
stop
squalling
its
maternal
grandmother
takes
a
large
leaf
fashions
it
into
a
puppet
to
represent
the
child
and
presses
it
against
the
infant
s
body
having
thus
decanted
the
spirit
so
to
speak
from
the
baby
into
the
puppet
she
pierces
the
effigy
with
little
arrows
from
a
thereby
killing
the
spirit
that
had
vexed
her
child
similarly
in
the
island
of
dama
between
new
guinea
and
celebes
where
sickness
is
ascribed
to
the
agency
of
demons
the
doctor
makes
a
doll
of
and
lays
it
together
with
some
betel
rice
and
half
of
an
empty
eggshell
on
the
patient
s
head
lured
by
this
bait
the
demon
quits
the
sufferer
s
body
and
enters
the
doll
which
the
wily
doctor
thereupon
promptly
decapitates
this
may
reasonably
be
supposed
to
make
an
end
of
the
demon
and
of
the
sickness
together
a
dyak
sorcerer
being
called
in
to
prescribe
for
a
little
boy
who
suffered
from
a
disorder
of
the
stomach
constructed
two
effigies
of
the
boy
and
his
mother
out
of
bundles
of
clothes
and
offered
them
together
with
some
of
the
parents
finery
to
the
devil
who
was
plaguing
the
child
it
was
hoped
that
the
demon
would
take
the
effigies
and
leave
the
boy
batta
magicians
can
conjure
the
demon
of
disease
out
of
the
patient
s
body
into
an
image
made
out
of
a
with
a
human
face
and
wrapt
up
in
magic
herbs
the
image
is
then
hurriedly
removed
and
thrown
away
or
buried
beyond
the
boundaries
of
the
village
sometimes
the
image
dressed
as
a
man
or
a
woman
according
to
the
sex
of
the
patient
is
deposited
at
a
or
other
thoroughfare
in
the
hope
that
some
seeing
it
may
start
and
cry
out
ah
is
dead
for
such
an
exclamation
is
supposed
to
delude
the
demon
of
disease
into
a
belief
that
he
has
accomplished
his
fell
purpose
so
he
takes
himself
off
and
leaves
the
sufferer
to
get
well
the

tribe
of
the
malay
peninsula
attribute
all
kinds
of
diseases
to
the
agency
of
spirits
which
they
call
fortunately
however
the
magician
can
induce
these
maleficent
beings
to
come
out
of
the
sick
person
and
take
up
their
abode
in
rude
figures
of
grass
which
are
hung
up
outside
the
houses
in
little
shrines
decorated
with
peeled
sticks
in
the
island
of
nias
people
fear
that
the
spirits
of
murdered
infants
may
come
and
cause
women
with
child
to
miscarry
to
divert
the
unwelcome
attention
of
these
sprites
from
a
pregnant
woman
an
elaborate
mechanism
has
been
contrived
a
potent
idol
called
fangola
is
set
up
beside
her
bed
to
guard
her
slumbers
during
the
hours
of
darkness
from
the
evil
things
that
might
harm
her
another
idol
connected
with
the
first
by
a
chain
of
is
erected
in
the
large
room
of
the
house
and
lastly
a
small
is
planted
in
front
of
the
second
idol
the
notion
is
that
the
sprites
scared
away
by
the
watchful
fangola
from
the
sleeping
woman
will
scramble
along
the
chain
of
to
the
other
idol
and
then
beholding
the
will
mistake
it
for
the
woman
they
were
looking
for
and
so
pounce
upon
it
instead
of
her
in
bhutan
when
the
lamas
make
noisy
music
to
drive
away
the
demon
who
is
causing
disease
little
models
of
animals
are
fashioned
of
flour
and
butter
and
the
evil
spirit
is
implored
to
enter
these
models
which
are
then
burnt
so
in
tibet
when
a
man
is
very
ill
and
all
other
remedies
have
failed
his
friends
will
sometimes
as
a
last
resort
offer
an
image
of
him
with
some
of
his
clothes
to
the
lord
of
death
beseeching
that
august
personage
to
accept
the
image
and
spare
the
man
a
burmese
mode
of
curing
a
sick
man
is
to
bury
a
small
effigy
of
him
in
a
tiny
coffin
after
which
he
ought
certainly
to
recover
in
siam
when
a
person
is
dangerously
ill
the
magician
models
a
small
image
of
him
in
clay
and
carrying
it
away
to
a
solitary
place
recites
charms
over
it
which
compel
the
malady
to
pass
from
the
sick
man
into
the
image
the
sorcerer
then
buries
the
image
and
the
sufferer
is
made
whole
so
too
in
cambodia
the
doctor
fashions
a
rude
effigy
of
his
patient
in
clay
and
deposits
it
in
some
lonely
spot
where
the
ghost
or
demon
takes
it
instead
of
the
man
the
same
ideas
and
the
same
practices
prevail
much
further
to
the
north
among
the
tribes
on
the
lower
course
of
the
river
amoor
when
a
goldi
or
a
gilyak
shaman
has
cast
out
the
devil
that
caused
disease
an
abode
has
to
be
provided
for
the
homeless
devil
and
this
is
done
by
making
a
wooden
idol
in
human
form
of
which
the
ejected
demon
takes
possession
the
chinese
of
amoy
make
great
use
of
cheap
effigies
as
means
of
diverting
ghostly
and
other
evil
influence
from
people
these
effigies
are
kept
in
stock
and
sold
in
the
shops
which
purvey
counterfeit
paper
money
and
other
spurious
wares
for
the
use
of
ghosts

who
accept
them
in
all
good
faith
instead
of
the
genuine
articles
nothing
could
well
be
cruder
than
the
puppets
that
are
employed
to
relieve
sufferers
from
the
many
ills
which
flesh
is
heir
to
they
are
composed
of
two
bamboo
splinters
fastened
together
crosswise
with
a
piece
of
paper
pasted
on

side
to
represent
a
human
body
two
other
shreds
of
paper
supposed
to
stand
for
boots
distinguish
the
effigy
of
a
man
from
the
effigy
of
a
woman
armed
with
one
of
these
substitutes
for
a
person
as
they
are
called
you
may
set
fortune
at
defiance
if
a
member
of
your
family
for
example
is
ailing
or
has
suffered
any
evil
whatever
or
even
is
merely
threatened
by
misfortune
all
that
you
have
to
do
is
to
send
for
one
of
these
puppets
pass
it
all
over
his
body
while
you
recite
an
appropriate
spell
and
then
burn
the
puppet
the
maleficent
influence
is
thus
elicited
from
the
person
of
the
sufferer
and
destroyed
once
for
all
if
your
child
has
tumbled
into
one
of
those
open
sewers
which
yawn
for
the
unwary
in
the
streets
you
need
only
fish
him
out
pass
the
puppet
over
his
filthy
little
body
and
say
this
contact
of
the
substitute
with
the
front
of
the
body
brings
purity
and
prosperity
and
the
contact
with
the
back
gives
power
to
eat
till
an
old
old
old
age
the
contact
with
the
left
side
establishes
for
years
and
years
and
the
contact
with
the
right
side
bestows
longevity
happy
fate
come
ill
fate
be
transferred
to
the
substitute
so
saying
you
burn
the
substitute
by
choice
near
the
unsavoury
spot
where
the
accident
happened
and
if
you
are
a
careful
man
you
will
fetch
a
pail
of
water
and
wash
the
ashes
away
moreover
the
child
s
head
should
be
shaven
quite
clean
but
if
the
sufferer
was
an
adult
it
is
enough
to
lay
bare
with
the
razor
a
small
patch
on
his
scalp
to
let
out
the
evil
influence
in
corea
effigies
are
employed
on
much
the
same
principle
for
the
purpose
of
prolonging
life
on
the
fourteenth
and
the
fifteenth
day
of
the
first
month
all
men
and
women
born
under
the
jen
or
man
star
make
certain
straw
images
dressed
in
clothes
and
containing
a
number
of
the
copper
cash
which
form
the
currency
of
the
country
strictly
speaking
there
should
be
as
many
cash
in
the
image
as
the
person
whom
it
represents
has
lived
years
but
the
rule
is
not
strictly
observed
these
images
are
placed
on
the
path
outside
the
house
and
the
poor
people
seize
them
and
tear
them
up
in
order
to
get
the
cash
which
they
contain
the
destruction
of
the
image
is
supposed
to
save
the
person
represented
from
death
for
ten
years
accordingly
the
ceremony
need
only
be
performed
once
in
ten
years
though
some
people
from
excess
of
caution
appear
to
observe
it
annually
the
abchases
of
the
caucasus
believe
that
sickness
is
sometimes
caused
by
mother
earth
so
in
order
to
appease
her
and
redeem
the
life
of
the
sick
man
an
innocent
maiden
will
make
a
puppet
in
human
form
richly
clad
and
bury
it
in
the
earth
saying
instead
of
the
sick
man
play
and
delight
yourself
with
the
ewe
negroes
of
togoland
in
west
africa
think
that
the
spirits
of
all
living
people
come
from
heaven
where
they
live
in
the
intervals
between
their
incarnations
life
in
amedzowe
as
they
call
that
heavenly
region
which
lies
a
little
to
the
east
of
the
town
of
ho
is
very
like
life
on
earth
there
are
fields
there
and
wildernesses
and
forests
also
there
are
all
kinds
of
food
such
as
yams
and
maize
and
likewise
not
to
speak
of
cotton
in
fact
all
these
things
came
from
heaven
just
as
men
themselves
did
moreover
everybody
has
his
spiritual
mother
in
heaven
and
his
spiritual
aunt
also
his
spiritual
uncle
his
spiritual
grandfather
and
so
on
just
as
on
earth
now
the
spirits
in
heaven
are
apt
to
resent
it
when
one
of
their
number
quits
them
to
go
and
be
born
as
a
child
on
earth
and
sometimes
they
will
pursue
the
truant
and
carry
him
back
to
the
celestial
country
and
that
is
what
we
call
death
little
children
are
most
commonly
fetched
away
by
their
mother
in
heaven
for
she
wearies
for
them
and
comes
and
lays
an
invisible
hand
on
the
child
and
it
sickens
and
dies
if
you
hear
a
child
whimpering
of
nights
you
may
be
sure
that
its
mother
from
heaven
has
laid
her
hand
on
it
and
is
drawing
it
away
to
herself
if
the
child
grows
very
sick
and
its
earthly
mother
fears
that
it
will
die
she
will
mould
two
figures
of
clay
a
man
and
a
woman
and
offer
them
in
exchange
to
the
heavenly
mother
saying
o
thou
bearer
and
mother
of
children
instead
of
the
child
that
has
gone
away
from
thee
we
bring
thee
here
in
exchange
these
clay
men
take
them
and
withdraw
thy
hand
from
the
child
in
this
visible
people
also
when
they
fall
sick
will
sometimes
make
images
of
clay
and
offer
them
as
substitutes
to
the
messengers
who
have
come
from
heaven
to
fetch
them
away
these
images
are
deposited
with
other
offerings
such
as
and
a
musket
by
the
roadside
and
if
the
messengers
accept
them
instead
of
the
sick
man
he
recovers
during
an
epidemic
of
the
ewe
negroes
will
sometimes
clear
a
space
outside
of
the
town
where
they
erect
a
number
of
low
mounds
and
cover
them
with
as
many
little
clay
figures
as
there
are
people
in
the
place
pots
of
food
and
water
are
also
set
out
for
the
refreshment
of
the
spirit
of
who
it
is
hoped
will
take
the
clay
figures
and
spare
the
living
folk
and
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure
the
road
into
the
town
is
barricaded
against
him
among
the
nishga
indians
of
british
columbia
when
a
dreams
a
dream
which
portends
death
to
somebody
he
informs
the
person
whose
life
is
threatened
and
together
they
concert
measures
to
avert
the
evil
omen
the
man
whose
life
is
at
stake
has
a
small
wooden
figure
called
a
made
as
like
himself
as
the
skill
of
the
will
allow
and
this
he
hangs
round
his
neck
by
a
string
so
that
the
figure
lies
exactly
over
his
heart
in
this
position
he
wears
it
long
enough
to
allow
the
heat
of
his
body
to
be
imparted
to
it
generally
for
about
four
days
on
the
fourth
day
the
comes
to
the
house
arrayed
in
his
bearskin
and
other
insignia
of
office
and
bringing
with
him
a
wisp
of
teased
bark
and
a
toy
canoe
made
of
thus
equipped
he
sings
a
doleful
ditty
the
of
the
tribe
then
he
washes
the
man
over
the
region
of
the
heart
with
the
wisp
of
bark
dipped
in
water
places
the
wisp
together
with
the
wooden
image
in
the
canoe
and
after
again
singing
the
commits
image
wisp
and
canoe
to
the
flames
where
they
are
all
consumed
the
is
now
changed
to
a
song
of
joy
and
the
man
who
was
lately
in
fear
of
his
life
joins
in
he
may
well
be
gay
for
has
he
not
given
death
the
slip
by
devoting
to
destruction
not
merely
a
wisp
saturated
with
the
dangerous
defilement
of
his
body
but
also
a
substitute
made
in
his
own
likeness
and
impregnated
with
his
very
heart
s
warmth
with
these
examples
before
us
we
may
fairly
conclude
that
the
woollen
effigies
which
at
the
festival
of
the
compitalia
might
be
seen
hanging
at
the
doors
of
all
the
houses
in
ancient
rome
were
not
substitutes
for
human
victims
who
had
formerly
been
sacrificed
at
this
season
but
rather
vicarious
offerings
presented
to
the
mother
or
grandmother
of
ghosts
in
the
hope
that
on
her
rounds
through
the
city
she
would
accept
or
mistake
the
effigies
for
the
inmates
of
the
house
and
so
spare
the
living
for
another
year
it
is
possible
that
the
puppets
made
of
rushes
which
in
the
month
of
may
the
pontiffs
and
vestal
virgins
annually
threw
into
the
tiber
from
the
old
sublician
bridge
at
rome
had
originally
the
same
significance
that
is
they
may
have
been
designed
to
purge
the
city
from
demoniac
influence
by
diverting
the
attention
of
the
demons
from
human
beings
to
the
puppets
and
then
toppling
the
whole
uncanny
crew
neck
and
crop
into
the
river
which
would
soon
sweep
them
far
out
to
sea
in
precisely
the
same
way
the
natives
of
old
calabar
used
periodically
to
rid
their
town
of
the
devils
which
infested
it
by
luring
the
unwary
demons
into
a
number
of
lamentable
scarecrows
which
they
afterwards
flung
into
the
river
this
interpretation
of
the
roman
custom
is
supported
to
some
extent
by
the
evidence
of
plutarch
who
speaks
of
the
ceremony
as
the
greatest
of
however
other
explanations
of
the
rite
have
been
proposed
indeed
these
puppets
of
rushes
have
been
a
standing
puzzle
to
roman
antiquaries
in
ancient
and
modern
times
chapter
xi
the
sacrifice
of
in
the
preceding
chapter
we
saw
that
primitive
peoples
often
partake
of
the
new
corn
and
the
new
fruits
sacramentally
because
they
suppose
them
to
be
instinct
with
a
divine
spirit
or
life
at
a
later
age
when
the
fruits
of
the
earth
are
conceived
as
created
rather
than
as
animated
by
a
divinity
the
new
fruits
are
no
longer
partaken
of
sacramentally
as
the
body
and
blood
of
a
god
but
a
portion
of
them
is
offered
to
the
divine
beings
who
are
believed
to
have
produced
them
originally
perhaps
offerings
of
were
supposed
to
be
necessary
for
the
subsistence
of
the
divinities
who
without
them
must
have
died
of
hunger
but
in
after
times
they
seem
to
be
looked
on
rather
in
the
light
of
a
tribute
or
mark
of
homage
rendered
by
man
to
the
gods
for
the
good
gifts
they
have
bestowed
on
him
sometimes
the
are
presented
to
the
king
perhaps
in
his
character
of
a
god
very
often
they
are
made
over
to
the
spirits
of
the
human
dead
who
are
sometimes
thought
to
have
it
in
their
power
to
give
or
withhold
the
crops
till
the
have
been
offered
to
the
deity
the
dead
or
the
king
people
are
not
at
liberty
to
eat
of
the
new
crops
but
as
it
is
not
always
possible
to
draw
a
sharp
line
between
the
sacrament
and
the
sacrifice
of
it
may
be
well
to
round
off
this
part
of
the
subject
by
giving
some
examples
of
the
latter
the
ovambo
or
ovakuanjama
of
africa
stand
in
great
fear
of
the
spirits
of
the
dead
who
are
believed
to
exercise
a
powerful
influence
over
the
living
in
particular
the
spirits
of
dead
chiefs
can
give
or
withhold
rain
a
matter
of
vital
importance
in
the
parched
region
of
ovamboland
accordingly
the
people
pay
great
respect
to
the
spirits
of
the
departed
and
they
hold
a
thanksgiving
festival
in
their
honour
at
the
close
of
the
harvest
when
the
new
corn
has
been
reaped
and
ground
a
portion
of
it
is
made
into
porridge
and
carried
to
the
quarters
of
the
principal
wife
here
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
kraal
assemble
the
head
of
the
family
takes
some
of
the
porridge
dips
it
in
melted
fat
and
throws
it
to
the
east
saying
take
it
ye
spirits
of
the
east
then
he
does
the
same
towards
the
west
saying
take
it
ye
spirits
of
the
west
this
is
regarded
as
a
presented
to
the
spirits
of
the
dead
for
not
visiting
the
people
with
sickness
while
they
were
cultivating
the
fields
and
especially
for
sending
the
rain
among
the
basutos
when
the
corn
has
been
threshed
and
winnowed
it
is
left
in
a
heap
on
the
before
it
can
be
touched
a
religious
ceremony
must
be
performed
the
persons
to
whom
the
corn
belongs
bring
a
new
vessel
to
the
spot
in
which
they
boil
some
of
the
grain
when
it
is
boiled
they
throw
a
few
handfuls
of
it
on
the
heap
of
corn
saying
thank
you
gods
give
us
bread
also
when
this
is
done
the
rest
is
eaten
and
the
provision
for
the
year
is
considered
pure
and
fit
to
eat
here
the
sacrifice
of
the
to
the
gods
is
the
prominent
idea
which
comes
out
again
in
the
custom
of
leaving
in
the
a
little
hollow
filled
with
grain
as
a
to
these
powerful
beings
still
the
basutos
retain
a
lively
sense
of
the
sanctity
of
the
corn
in
itself
for
so
long
as
it
is
exposed
to
view
all
defiled
persons
are
carefully
kept
from
it
if
it
is
necessary
to
employ
a
defiled
person
in
carrying
home
the
harvest
he
remains
at
some
distance
while
the
sacks
are
being
filled
and
only
approaches
to
place
them
upon
the
draught
oxen
as
soon
as
the
load
is
deposited
at
the
dwelling
he
retires
and
under
no
pretext
may
he
help
to
pour
the
corn
into
the
baskets
in
which
it
is
kept
the
makalaka
worship
a
god
called
shumpaoli
whose
image
is
to
be
found
in
the
enclosure
outside
of
their
huts
the
image
consists
of
the
head
of
an
axe
a
stone
from
the
river
and
a
twig
or
long
stalk
of
grass
planted
between
them
in
the
ground
about
this
god
they
scatter
the
of
their
harvest
and
when
they
brew
beer
they
pour
some
of
it
on
him
of
the
bantu
tribes
of
south
africa
in
general
we
are
told
that
they
might
not
eat
of
the
new
crops
till
the
chief
gave
them
leave
to
do
so
when
the
millet
was
ripe
he
appointed
a
general
assembly
of
the
people
at
his
residence
which
was
known
as
the
great
place
he
then
performed
certain
rites
and
in
particular
he
offered
a
small
quantity
of
the
fresh
grain
to
the
spirits
of
his
ancestors
either
by
laying
it
on
their
graves
or
by
casting
it
into
a
stream
after
that
he
granted
the
people
permission
to
gather
and
eat
the
new
corn
among
the
maraves
or
zimbas
a
tribe
of
the
upper
zambesi
bordering
on
the
portuguese
territory
it
is
the
custom
that
of
all
produce
must
be
offered
to
the
spirits
of
the
dead
to
whom
they
attribute
all
the
good
and
ill
that
befall
them
every
year
at
the
offerings
are
brought
to
these
mighty
beings
small
portions
of
all
kinds
of
fruits
together
with
cooked
fowls
and
the
native
intoxicant
are
carried
in
procession
with
songs

and
the
beating
of
drums
to
the
which
is
always
situated
in
a
grove
or
a
wilderness
and
is
esteemed
a
sacred
place
no
tree
may
be
felled
and
no
animal
killed
on
the
holy
ground
for
the
natives
believe
that
a
spirit
of
the
dead
is
present
in
everything
within
the
precincts
among
the
yaos
of
british
central
africa
offerings
are
made
to

or
to
as
the
great
agency
in
the
affairs
of
human
life
outside

may
often
be
seen
a

placed
the
of

green
maize
beans
pumpkins
peas
as
a

offering
from

this
is
described
as
to
worship
by
the

mean
primarily
and
strictly
the
soul
of
a
dead
person
which
is

is
sacred
to
the

afterwards
the
are
given
to
brahmans
also
when
the
women
begin
to
pick
the
cotton
they
go
round
the
field
eating
the
first
mouthful
of
which
they
spit
upon
the
field
toward
the
west
and
the
first
cotton
picked
is
exchanged
at
the
village
shop
for
its
weight
in
salt
which
is
prayed
over
and
kept
in
the
house
till
the
picking
is
finished
among
the
ancient
hindoos
the
were
sacrificed
to
the
gods
at
the
beginning
of
harvest
generally
at
the
new
or
the
full
moon
there
were
two
harvests
in
the
year
the
barley
was
reaped
in
spring
and
the
rice
in
autumn
from
the
new
grain
whether
barley
or
rice
a
sacrificial
cake
was
prepared
and
set
forth
on
twelve
potsherds
for
the
two
great
gods
indra
and
agni
a
pap
or
gruel
of
boiled
grain
sodden
either
in
water
or
milk
was
offered
to
the
visve
devah
that
is
to
the
common
mob
of
deities
and
a
cake
on
one
potsherd
was
presented
to
heaven
and
earth
the
origin
of
these
sacrifices
of
was
explained
by
the
following
myth
they
say
that
the
gods
and
their
powerful
rivals
the
asuras
once
strove
with
each
other
for
the
mastery
in
this
strife
the
asuras
defiled
both
by
magic
and
by
poison
the
plants
on
which
men
and
beasts
subsist
for
thus
they
hoped
to
get
the
better
of
the
gods
therefore
neither
man
nor
beast
could
eat
food
and
for
lack
of
it
they
well
nigh
perished
when
the
gods
heard
of
it
they
said
one
to
the
other
come
let
us
rid
the
plants
of
the
defilement
and
they
did
so
by
means
of
the
sacrifice
but
they
could
not
agree
as
to
which
of
them
should
receive
the
sacrifices
so
to
decide
this
delicate
question
they
ran
a
race
and
indra
and
agni
came
in
first
that
is
why
the
cake
is
offered
to
them
on
twelve
potsherds
while
the
common
mob
of
the
gods
have
to
put
up
with
a
simple
pap
or
gruel
to
this
day
therefore
he
who
offers
the
to
the
gods
does
it
either
because
no
one
will
then
be
able
to
defile
the
plants
neither
by
magic
nor
yet
by
poison
or
perhaps
he
does
it
because
the
gods
did
so
before
him
be
that
as
it
may
certain
it
is
that
he
thereby
renders
both
kinds
of
plants
wholesome
and
innocuous
both
the
plants
which
men
eat
and
the
plants
on
which
cattle
graze
that
indeed
is
the
reason
why
the
sacrificer
sacrifices
the
and
the
priest
s
fee
for
the
sacrifice
is
the
calf
of
the
season
which
is
as
it
were
the
of
the
cattle
the
kachins
of
upper
burma
worship
the
spirit
of
the
earth
every
year
before
they
sow
their
crops
the
worship
is
performed
by
the
chief
on
behalf
of
all
the
villagers
who
contribute
their
offerings
the
priest
afterwards
determines
by
exorcism
which
particular
household
shall
start
sowing
first
in
order
that
the
crop
may
be
a
good
one
then
the
household
on
which
the
lot
has
fallen
goes
out
and
sows
its
fields
when
the
crop
is
ripe
it
may
not
be
reaped
until
the
household
which
was
the
first
to
sow
its
fields
has
gathered
the
and
offered
them
to
its
own
domestic
spirits
this
is
usually
done
before
the
crop
is
quite
ripe
in
order
that
the
reaping
of
the
other
crops
may
not
be
delayed
the
chins
another
people
of
upper
burma
eat
the
of
their
corn
as
a
religious
rite
but
before
doing
so
they
offer
some
of
the
new
corn
or
vegetables
to
their
dead
ancestors
they
also
offer
the
to
the
goddess
pok
klai
a
single
glance
of
whose
eyes
is
enough
to
give
them
a
plentiful
harvest
of
rice
among
the
thay
of
the
of
the
rice
are
offered
at
harvest
to
the
guardian
spirit
of
the
family
before
the
household
may
partake
of
the
new
crop
the
guardian
spirit
of
the
family
is
the
last
ancestor
who
died
he
mounts
guard
until
he
is
relieved
by
his
successor
his
shrine
is
a
corner
of
the
house
screened
off
by
a
low
trellis
of
bamboo
but
besides
the
offered
him
at
harvest
this
guardian
spirit
receives
some
of
the
parched
grain
in
spring
at
the
time
when
the
first
thunder
of
the
season
is
heard
to
mutter
the
grain
which
is
presented
to
him
on
this
occasion
was
plucked
from
the
crop
before
the
rice
was
quite
ripe
and
it
has
been
carefully
kept
to
be
offered
to
him
when
the
first
peal
of
thunder
in
spring
announces
the
reviving
energies
of
nature
when
all
is
ready
the
rice
is
served
up
together
with
fish
which
have
been
caught
for
the
purpose
on
a
table
set
in
the
corner
which
is
sacred
to
the
guardian
spirit
a
priest
drones
out
a
long
invitation
to
the
spirit
to
come
and
feast
with
his
children
then
the
family
sits
down
to
table
and
consumes
the
offerings
at
the
close
of
the
banquet
the
of
the
deceased
ancestor
hangs
up
a
basket
containing
rice
and
fish
for
his
use
in
the
corner
after
which
she
closes
the
shrine
for
another
year
in
corea
the
of
all
the
crops
used
to
be
offered
to
the
king
with
religious
pomp
and
he
received
almost
divine
honours
from
his
subjects
this
suggests
that
as
i
have
already
conjectured
the
common
practice
of
presenting
the
to
kings
is
founded
on
a
belief
in
their
divinity
in
the
island
of
tjumba
east
indies
a
festival
is
held
after
harvest
vessels
filled
with
rice
are
presented
as
a
thankoffering
to
the
gods
then
the
sacred
stone
at
the
foot
of
a
is
sprinkled
with
the
blood
of
a
sacrificed
animal
and
rice
with
some
of
the
flesh
is
laid
on
the
stone
for
the
gods
the
is
hung
with
lances
and
shields
the
dyaks
of
borneo
hold
a
feast
of
when
the
paddy
or
unhusked
rice
is
ripe
the
priestesses
accompanied
by
a
gong
and
drum
go
in
procession
to
the
farms
and
gather
several
bunches
of
the
ripe
paddy
these
are
brought
back
to
the
village
washed
in
water
and
laid
round
a
bamboo
altar
which
at
the
harvest
festivals
is
erected
in
the
common
room
of
the
largest
house
the
altar
is
gaily
decorated
with
white
and
red
streamers
and
is
hung
with
the
blossom
of
the
areca
palm
the
feast
lasts
two
days
during
which
the
village
is
tabooed
no
one
may
leave
it
only
fowls
are
killed
and
dancing
and
go
on
day
and
night
when
the
festival
is
over
the
people
are
free
to
get
in
their
crops
the
pounding
of
the
new
paddy
is
the
occasion
of
a
harvest
festival
which
is
celebrated
all
over
celebes
the
religious
ceremonies
which
accompany
the
feast
were
witnessed
by
matthes
in
july
two
mats
were
spread
on
the
ground
each
with
a
pillow
on
it
on
one
of
the
pillows
were
placed
a
man
s
clothes
and
a
sword
on
the
other
a
woman
s
clothes
these
were
seemingly
intended
to
represent
the
deceased
ancestors
rice
and
water
were
deposited
before
the
two
dummy
figures
which
were
also
sprinkled
with
the
new
paddy
moreover
dishes
of
rice
were
set
down
for
the
rest
of
the
family
and
the
slaves
of
the
deceased
this
was
the
end
of
the
ceremony
in
minahassa
a
district
of
celebes
the
people
have
a
festival
of
eating
the
new
fowls
or
pigs
are
killed
some
of
the

and
is
set
apart
for
the

and
then
the

the
of
the

in
the
form
of
cooked
rice
with
tobacco
and
other
things
to
their

as
a
token
of
gratitude
the

is
called

the
of

are
offered
to
the
the

the
spirits
of
their

which
are
worshipped
as
or
household
gods
they
are
supposed
to
enter
the
house
through
an
opening
in
the
roof
and
to
take
up
their
abode
temporarily
in
their
skulls
or
in
images
of
wood
or
ivory
in
order
to
partake
of
the
offerings
and
to
help
the
family
they
also
assume
the
form
of
birds
pigs
crocodiles
turtles
sharks
and
so
forth
in
amboyna
after
the
rice
or
other
harvest
has
been
gathered
in
some
of
the
new
fruits
are
offered
to
the
gods
and
till
this
is
done
the
priests
may
by
no
means
eat
of
them
a
portion
of
the
new
rice

whatever
it
may

is
boiled
and
milk

it
is
then
taken
to

place
of
sacrifice
and
offered
to
the
god
some
people
also
pour
out
oil
before
the
deity
and
if
any
of
the
oil
is
left
over
they
take
it
home
as
a
holy
and
priceless
treasure
wherewith
they
smear
the
forehead
and
breast
of
sick
people
and
whole
people
in
the
firm
conviction
that
the

confers
all

offered
to

the
god
of

when
the
harvest
is
ripe
after
the
rice
has
been
reaped
the
people
of
nias
deck
the
images
of
their
ancestors
with
wreaths
and
offer
to
them
the
first
dishful
of
boiled
rice
while
they
thank
them
for
the
blessings
they
have
bestowed
on
the
family
the
irayas
and
catalangans
of
luzon
tribes
of
the

stock
but
of
mixed

worship
chiefly
the
souls
of
their
ancestors
under
the
name
of
to
whom
they
offer
the
of
the

the
are
household
deities
some
of
them
reside
in
pots
in
the
corners
of
the
houses
and
miniature
houses
standing
near
the
family
dwelling
are
especially
sacred
to
them
when
the
bagobos
of
the
philippines
have
got
in
their
harvest
of
rice
or
maize
they
will
neither
eat
of
it
nor
sell
so
much
as
a
grain
till
they
have
made
a
pretence
of
feeding
all
their
agricultural
implements
the
bukaua
of
german
new
guinea
think
that
the
spirits
of
their
dead
have
power
to
make
the
fruits
of
the
earth
to
grow
accordingly
when
they
have
cleared
a
patch
in
the
forest
for
cultivation
and
are
planting
their
crops
they
take
particular
care
to
plant
slips
near
the
which
have
been
left
standing
in
the
field
because
the
spirits
of
their
long
dead
ancestors
are
supposed
to
perch
on
them
while
they
plant
they
call
out
the
names
of
the
dead
praying
them
to
guard
the
field
so
that
their
children
the
living
may
have
food
to
eat
and
not
suffer
hunger
and
similarly
when
they
plant
stones
shaped
like
taro
bulbs
in
the
ground
which
are
supposed
to
produce
a
fine
crop
of
taro
they
pray
to
their
forefathers
to
grant
them
an
abundance
of
the
fruits
when
the
crops
are
ripe
the
people
fetch
bundles
of
taro
clusters
of
bananas
and
vegetables
from
the
fields
and
bring
them
back
solemnly
to
the
village
a
feast
is
prepared
and
a
portion
of
the
new
fruits
along
with
tobacco
betel
and
dog
s
flesh
is
put
in
a
shell
and
set
on
a
scaffold
in
the
house
of
the
owner
of
the
field
while
he
prays
to
the
spirits
of
his
forefathers
saying
ye
who
have
guarded
our
field
as
we
asked
you
to
do
there
is
something
for
you
now
look
on
us
favourably
also
for
the
time
to
afterwards
while
the
people
are
feasting
the
owner
privily
stirs
the
contents
of
the
shell
with
his
finger
and
then
calls
the
attention
of
the
others
to
it
as
a
proof
that
the
spirits
have
partaken
of
the
offering
provided
for
them
finally
the
food
remaining
in
the
shell
is
consumed
by
the
banqueters
in
certain
tribes
of
fiji
the
of
the
yam
harvest
are
presented
to
the
ancestors
in
the
nanga
sacred
enclosure
with
great
ceremony
before
the
bulk
of
the
crop
is
dug
for
the
people
s
use
and
no
man
may
taste
of
the
new
yams
until
the
presentation
has
been
made
the
yams
thus
offered
are
piled
in
the
great
nanga
and
are
allowed
to
rot
there
if
any
one
were
impiously
bold
enough
to
appropriate
them
to
his
own
use
he
would
be
smitten
with
madness
the
mission
teacher
before
mentioned
told
me
that
when
he
visited
the
nanga
he
saw
among
the
weeds
with
which
it
was
overgrown
numerous
yam
vines
which
had
sprung
up
out
of
the
piles
of
decayed
offerings
great
feasts
are
made
at
the
presentations
of
the
which
are
times
of
public
rejoicing
and
the
nanga
itself
is
frequently
spoken
of
as
the
or
in
other
parts
of
fiji
the
practice
with
regard
to
the
seems
to
have
been
different
for
we
are
told
by
another
observer
that
the
of
the
yams
which
are
always
presented
at
the
principal
temple
of
the
district
become
the
property
of
the
priests
and
form
their
revenue
although
the
pretence
of
their
being
required
for
the
use
of
the
god
is
generally
kept
in
tana
one
of
the
new
hebrides
the
general
name
for
gods
appeared
to
be
which
meant
a
dead
the
spirits
of
departed
ancestors
were
among
the
gods
of
the
people
chiefs
who
reached
an
advanced
age
were
deified
after
their
death
addressed
by
name
and
prayed
to
on
various
occasions
they
were
supposed
to
preside
especially
over
the
growth
of
the
yams
and
the
were
presented
to
them
a
little
of
the
new
fruit
was
laid
on
a
stone
or
on
a
shelving
branch
of
the
tree
or
on
a
rude
temporary
altar
made
of
a
few
sticks
lashed
together
with
strips
of
bark
in
the
form
of
a
table
with
its
four
feet
stuck
in
the
ground
all
being
quiet
the
chief
acted
as
high
priest
and
prayed
aloud
as
follows
compassionate
father
here
is
some
food
for
you
eat
it
be
kind
to
us
on
account
of
then
all
the
people
shouted
this
took
place
about
noon
and
afterwards
the
assembled
people
feasted
and
danced
till
midnight
or
morning
in
florida
one
of
the
solomon
islands
the
canarium
nut
is
much
used
in
the
native
cookery
but
formerly
none
might
be
eaten
till
the
sacrifice
of
the
had
been
offered
to
the
ghosts
of
the
dead
this
was
done
on
behalf
of
a
whole
village
by
a
man
who
inherited
a
knowledge
of
the
way
in
which
the
sacrifice
should
be
offered
and
who
accordingly
had
authority
to
open
the
season
when
he
saw
that
the
time
had
come
he
raised
a
shout
early
in
the
morning
then
climbed
a
tree
cracked
the
nuts
ate
some
himself
and
put
some
on
the
stones
in
his
sacred
place
for
the
particular
ghost
whom
he
worshipped
then
all
the
people
might
gather
the
nuts
for
themselves
the
chief
offered
food
in
which
the
new
nuts
were
mixed
on
the
stones
of
the
village
sanctuary
and
every
man
who
revered
a
ghost
of
his
own
did
the
same
in
his
private
sanctuary
this
sacrifice
of
was
witnessed
by
woodford
at
the
village
of
aola
in
the
neighbouring
island
of
guadalcanar
the
canarium
nuts
or
solomon
island
almonds
had
been
ripe
for
a
week
and
woodford
had
expressed
a
wish
to
taste
them
but
he
was
told
that
this
was
quite
impossible
till
the
offering
to
the
ghost
had
been
made
as
a
native
put
it
devil
he
eat
first
all
man
he
eat
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
village
adjourned
to
the
in
groups
of
ten
or
twelve
to
perform
the
sacrifice
the
party
to
which
woodford
attached
himself
swept
a
space
clean
beneath
the
spreading
branches
of
a
barringtonia
and
there
constructed
tiny
altars
each
about
six
inches
square
out
of
dry
sticks
on
these
altars
they
laid
offerings
of
yams
taros
bananas
and
a
little
flesh
and
a
few
of
the
nuts
were
skinned
and
set
up
on
sticks
round
about
the
altars
fire
was
then
made
by
the
friction
of
wood
for
matches
might
not
be
used
for
this
purpose
though
probably
every
man
had
a
box
of
them
in
his
bag
with
the
sacred
flame
thus
produced
the
altars
were
kindled
and
the
offerings
consumed
when
this
was
done
the
women
produced
large
flat
cakes
baked
of
a
paste
of
pounded
nuts
and
these
were
eaten
by
all
in
saa
another
of
the
solomon
islands
when
the
yams
are
ripe
the
people
fetch
some
from
each
garden
to
offer
to
the
ghosts
early
in
the
morning
all
the
male
members
of
a
family
assemble
at
the
sanctuary
of
the
particular
ancestral
ghosts
whom
they
revere
one
of
them
goes
with
a
yam
into
the
holy
place
and
cries
with
a
loud
voice
to
the
ghosts
this
is
yours
to
eat
and
with
that
he
sets
the
yam
beside
the
skull
which
is
in
the
sanctuary
the
others
call
quietly
upon
all
the
ancestors
and
present
their
yams
which
are
many
in
number
because
one
from
each
garden
is
given
to
each
of
the
ghosts
moreover
if
any
man
has
a
relic
of
the
dead
at
home
such
as
a
head
or
bones
or
hair
he
takes
back
a
yam
to
his
house
and
places
it
beside
the
head
or
whatever
it
may
be
in
the
same
island
as
in
florida
the
new
canarium
nuts
may
not
be
eaten
until
the
have
been
offered
to
the
ghosts
moreover
the
first
of
the
season
must
be
sacrificed
to
these
spirits
of
the
dead
before
the
living
are
allowed
to
partake
of
the
fish
the
ghosts
to
whom
the
are
offered
have
the
form
of
sharks
some
of
them
have
sanctuaries
ashore
where
images
of
sharks
are
set
up
and
the
are
laid
before
these
images
other
have
no
place
on
shore
so
the
fish
offered
to
them
are
taken
out
to
sea
and
shredded
into
the
water
while
the
names
of
the
ghosts
are
called
out
in
some
of
the
kingsmill
islands
the
god
most
commonly
worshipped
was
called
tubuériki
he
was
represented
by
a
flat
coral
stone
of
irregular
shape
about
three
feet
long
by
eighteen
inches
wide
set
up
on
end
in
the
open
air
leaves
of
the
palm
were
tied
about
it
considerably
increasing
its
size
and
height
the
leaves
were
changed
every
month
that
they
might
be
always
fresh
the
worship
paid
to
the
god
consisted
in
repeating
prayers
before
the
stone
and
laying
beside
it
a
portion
of
the
food
prepared
by
the
people
for
their
own
use
this
they
did
at
their
daily
meals
at
festivals
and
whenever
they
specially
wished
to
propitiate
the
deity
the
of
the
season
were
always
offered
to
him
every
family
of
distinction
had
one
of
these
stones
which
was
considered
rather
in
the
light
of
a
family
altar
than
as
an
idol
in
the
tonga
islands
the
of
the
year
were
offered
with
solemn
ceremony
to
the
sacred
chief
tooitonga
who
was
regarded
as
divine
the
ceremony
generally
took
place
about
october
and
the
people
believed
that
if
the
rite
were
neglected
the
vengeance
of
the
gods
would
fall
in
a
signal
manner
upon
them
the
following
is
a
description
of
the
festival
as
it
was
celebrated
in
the
days
when
a
european
flag
rarely
floated
among
the
islands
of
the
pacific
this
word
means
literally
a
share
or
portion
of
anything
that
is
to
be
or
has
been
distributed
out
but
in
the
sense
here
mentioned
it
means
that
portion
of
the
fruits
of
the
earth
and
other
eatables
which
is
offered
to
the
gods
in
the
person
of
the
divine
chief
tooitonga
which
allotment
is
made
once
a
year
just
before
the
yams
in
general
are
arrived
at
a
state
of
maturity
those
which
are
used
in
this
ceremony
being
of
a
kind
which
admit
of
being
planted
sooner
than
others
and
consequently
they
are
the
first
fruits
of
the
yam
season
the
object
of
this
offering
is
to
insure
the
protection
of
the
gods
that
their
favour
may
be
extended
to
the
welfare
of
the
nation
generally
and
in
particular
to
the
productions
of
the
earth
of
which
yams
are
the
most
important
the
time
for
planting
most
kinds
of
yams
is
about
the
latter
end
of
july
but
the
species
called
which
is
always
used
in
this
ceremony
is
put
in
the
ground
about
a
month
before
when
on
each
plantation
there
is
a
small
piece
of
land
chosen
and
fenced
in
for
the
purpose
of
growing
a
couple
of
yams
of
the
above
description
as
soon
as
they
have
arrived
at
a
state
of
maturity
the
the
king
sends
a
messenger
to
tooitonga
stating
that
the
yams
for
the
are
fit
to
be
taken
up
and
requesting
that
he
would
appoint
a
day
for
the
ceremony
he
generally
fixes
on
the
tenth
day
afterwards
reckoning
the
following
day
for
the
first
there
are
no
particular
preparations
made
till
the
day
before
the
ceremony
at
night
however
the
sound
of
the
conch
is
heard
occasionally
in
different
parts
of
the
islands
and
as
the
day
of
the
ceremony
approaches
it
becomes
more
frequent
so
that
the
people
of
almost
every
plantation
sound
the
conch
three
or
four
times
which
breaking
in
upon
the
silence
of
the
night
has
a
pleasing
effect
particularly
at
vavaoo
where
the
number
of
woods
and
hills
send
back
repeated
echoes
adding
greatly
to
the
effect
the
day
before
the
ceremony
the
yams
are
dug
up
and
ornamented
with
a
kind
of
ribbons
prepared
from
the
inner
membrane
of
the
leaf
of
a
species
of
pandanus
and
dyed
red
when
thus
prepared
it
is
called
and
is
wrapped
round
the
yam
beginning
at
one
end
and
running
round
spirally
to
the
other
when
it
is
brought
back
in
the
opposite
direction
the
turns
crossing
each
other
in
a
very
neat
manner
as
the
ceremony
is
always
performed
at
the
island
where
tooitonga
chooses
to
reside
the
distant
islands
must
make
these
preparations
two
or
three
days
beforehand
that
the
yams
may
be
sent
in
time
to
vavaoo
where
we
will
suppose
the
affair
is
to
take
place
the
ninth
day
then
is
employed
in
preparing
and
collecting
the
yams
and
other
provisions
such
as
fish
cava
root
and
and
getting
ready
mats
and
bundles
of
but
the
yams
only
are
to
be
carried
in
the
procession
about
to
be
described
the
sun
has
scarcely
set
when
the
sound
of
the
conch
begins
again
to
echo
through
the
island
increasing
as
the
night
advances
at
the
mooa
capital
and
all
the
plantations
the
voices
of
men
and
women
are
heard
singing
óooa
tegger
gnaoóe
óooa
rest
thou
doing
no
work
thou
shalt
not
this
increases
till
midnight
men
generally
singing
the
first
part
of
the
sentence
and
the
women
the
last
to
produce
a
more
pleasing
effect
it
then
subsides
for
three
or
four
hours
and
again
increases
as
the
sun
rises
nobody
however
is
seen
stirring
out
in
the
public
roads
till
about
eight
o
clock
when
the
people
from
all
quarters
of
the
island
are
seen
advancing
towards
the
mooa
and
canoes
from
all
the
other
islands
are
landing
their
men
so
that
all
the
inhabitants
of
tonga
seem
approaching
by
sea
and
land
singing
and
sounding
the
conch
at
the
mooa
itself
the
universal
bustle
of
preparation
is
seen
and
heard
and
the
different
processions
entering
from
various
quarters
of
men
and
women
all
dressed
up
in
new
ornamented
with
red
ribbons
and
wreaths
of
flowers
and
the
men
armed
with
spears
and
clubs
betoken
the
importance
of
the
ceremony
about
to
be
performed
each
party
brings
in
its
yams
in
a
basket
which
is
carried
in
the
arms
with
great
care
by
the
principal
vassal
of
the
chief
to
whom
the
plantation
may
belong
the
baskets
are
deposited
in
the
in
the
and
some
of
them
begin
to
employ
themselves
in
slinging
the
yams
each
upon
the
centre
of
a
pole
about
eight
or
nine
feet
long
and
four
inches
diameter
the
proceedings
are
regulated
by
attending
matabooles
the
yams
being
all
slung
each
pole
is
carried
by
two
men
upon
their
shoulders
one
walking
before
the
other
and
the
yam
hanging
between
them
ornamented
with
red
ribbons
the
procession
begins
to
move
towards
the
grave
of
the
last
tooitonga
which
is
generally
in
the
neighbourhood
or
the
grave
of
one
of
his
family
will
do
the
men
advancing
in
a
single
line
every
two
bearing
a
yam
with
a
slow
and
measured
pace
sinking
at
every
step
as
if
their
burden
were
of
immense
weight
in
the
meantime
the
chiefs
and
matabooles
are
seated
in
a
semicircle
before
the
grave
with
their
heads
bowed
down
and
their
hands
clasped
before
the
procession
then
marched
round
the
grave
twice
or
thrice
in
a
great
circle
the
conchs
blowing
and
the
men
singing
next
the
yams
still
suspended
from
the
poles
were
deposited
before
the
grave
and
their
bearers
sat
down
beside
them
one
of
the
of
tooitonga
seating
himself
before
the
grave
a
little
in
advance
of
the
men
now
addressed
the
gods
generally
and
afterwards
particularly
mentioning
the
late
tooitonga
and
the
names
of
several
others
he
thanked
them
for
their
divine
bounty
in
favouring
the
land
with
the
prospect
of
so
good
a
harvest
and
prayed
that
their
beneficence
might
be
continued
in
future
when
he
had
finished
the
men
rose
and
resumed
their
loads
and
after
parading
two
or
three
times
before
the
grave
marched
back
to
the
the
same
way
they
came
singing
and
blowing
the
conchs
as
before
the
chiefs
and
soon
followed
to
the
same
place
where
the
yams
had
been
again
deposited
and
loosened
from
the
poles
though
they
still
retained
their
ornaments
here
the
company
sat
down
in
a
great
circle
presided
over
by
tooitonga
while
the
king
and
other
great
chiefs
retired
into
the
background
among
the
mass
of
the
people
then
the
other
articles
that
formed
part
of
the
were
brought
forward
consisting
of
dried
fish
mats
which
with
the
yams
were
divided
into
shares
by
one
of
the
of
tooitonga
about
a
fourth
was
allotted
to
the
gods
and
appropriated
by
the
priests
about
a
half
fell
to
the
king
and
the
remainder
belonged
to
tooitonga
the
materials
of
the
having
been
carried
away
the
company
set
themselves
to
drink
some
root
was
brought
and
prepared
a
large
quantity
of
provisions
perhaps
a
hundred
and
fifty
was
set
forth
and
a
small
part
of
it
was
distributed
to
be
eaten
with
the
while
the
infusion
was
preparing
a
made
a
speech
to
the
people
saying
that
as
they
had
performed
this
important
ceremony
the
gods
would
protect
them
and
grant
them
long
lives
if
only
they
continued
to
observe
the
religious
rites
and
to
pay
due
respect
to
the
chiefs
when
the
was
all
drunk
the
circle
separated
and
the
provisions
were
shared
out
to
each
chief
according
to
his
rank
the
day
concluded
with
wrestling
boxing
and
so
forth
and
then
the
night
dances
began
when
these
were
ended
the
people
went
home
perfectly
assured
of
the
protection
of
the
gods
at
this
ceremony
we
are
informed
the
quantity
of
provisions
distributed
was
incredible
and
the
people
looked
upon
it
as
a
very
heavy
tribute
in
this
tongan
festival
the
solemn
presentation
of
the
to
the
divine
chief
at
the
grave
of
his
predecessor
is
highly
significant
it
confirms
the
conclusion
which
we
have
already
reached
that
wherever
the
are
paid
to
the
chief
it
is
rather
in
his
religious
than
in
his
civil
capacity
that
he
receives
them
it
is
true
that
the
king
of
tonga
received
a
large
share
of
the
indeed
a
larger
share
than
was
allotted
to
the
divine
chief
but
it
is
very
noticeable
that
while
the
division
of
the
was
taking
place
under
the
presidency
of
the
divine
chief
the
king
and
the
other
great
chiefs
retired
from
the
scene
and
mingled
with
the
mass
of
the
people
as
if
to
indicate
that
as
mere
laymen
they
had
no
right
to
participate
in
a
religious
rite
of
such
deep
solemnity
the
samoans
used
to
present
the
to
the
spirits
and
chiefs
for
example
a
family
whose
god
was
in
the
form
of
an
eel
presented
the
of
their
taro
plantations
to
the
eel
in
tahiti
the
first
fish
taken
periodically
on
their
shores
together
with
a
number
of
kinds
regarded
as
sacred
were
conveyed
to
the
altar
the
of
their
orchards
and
gardens
were
also
or
offered
with
a
portion
of
their
live
stock
which
consisted
of
pigs
dogs
and
fowls
as
it
was
supposed
death
would
be
inflicted
on
the
owner
or
the
occupant
of
the
land
from
which
the
god
should
not
receive
such
in
huahine
one
of
the
society

were
presented
to
the
god

a
poor
person
was
expected
to
bring
two
of
the
earliest
fruits
gathered
of
whatever
kind
a
had
to
bring
ten
and
chiefs
and
princes
had
to
bring
more
according
to
their
rank
and
riches
they
carried
the
fruits
to
the
temple
where
they
threw
them
down
on
the
ground
with
the
words
here
tani
i
have
brought
you
something
to
the
chief
gods
of
the
easter
islanders
were
and
haua
to
these
they
offered
the
first
of
all
the
produce
of
the
ground
amongst
the
maoris
the
offering
of
the
of
the
sweet
potatoes
to
pani
son
of
rongo
the
god
of
sweet
potatoes
was
a
solemn
religious
ceremony
the
crop
of
sweet
potatoes
was
sacred
and
all
persons
engaged
in
its
cultivation
were
also
sacred
or
tabooed
they
might
not
quit
the
place
nor
undertake
any
other
work
it
has
been
affirmed
that
the
old
prussians
offered
the
of
their
crops
and
of
their
fishing
to
the
god
curcho
but
doubt
rests
on
the
statement
we
have
seen
that
the
athenians
and
other
greek
peoples
offered
the
of
the
wheat
and
barley
harvests
to
demeter
and
persephone
at
eleusis
the
troezenians
sacrificed
the
to
poseidon
whom
they
worshipped
as
the
guardian
deity
of
their
city
in
attica
the
of
the
vintage
were
presented
to
icarius
and
erigone
the
romans
sacrificed
the
first
ears
of
corn
to
ceres
and
the
first
of
the
new
wine
to
liber
and
until
the
priests
had
offered
these
sacrifices
the
people
might
not
eat
the
new
corn
nor
drink
the
new
wine
in
various
parts
of
ancient
italy
the
vintage
was
solemnly
inaugurated
by
the
priests
at
rome
the
duty
devolved
on
the
flamen
dialis
who
sacrificed
a
lamb
to
jupiter
and
then
gathered
the
first
grapes
over
the
entrails
of
the
victim
till
this
ceremony
had
been
performed
the
new
wine
might
not
be
brought
into
the
city
the
thompson
river
indians
of
british
columbia
used
to
offer
the
first
berries
of
the
season
to
the
earth
or
more
generally
to
the
mountains
the
offering
was
made
by
an
old
person
who
danced
and
held
out
the
fruit
towards
the
the
rest
of
the
people
painted
their
faces
red
and
danced
for
some
time
the
okanaken
indians
of
british
columbia
observed
ceremonies
when
the
first
berries
or
roots
were
ripe
the
chief
would
send
out
his
wife
or
eldest
daughter
to
gather
a
portion
the
whole
community
would
then
come
together
and
prayers
would
be
offered
to
those
spirits
of
the
sky
who
were
supposed
to
preside
over
the
operations
of
nature
portions
of
the
fruit
or
roots
would
be
distributed
to
all
present
after
which
any
one
was
free
to
gather
all
he
or
she
desired
but
no
one
would
think
of
picking
a
berry
or
digging
a
root
until
after
the
feast
had
been
when
the
ears
of
maize
were
formed
the
quiches
of
central
america
gathered
the
and
carried
them
to
the
priests
moreover
they
baked
loaves
or
cakes
which
they
offered
to
the
idol
who
guarded
their
fields
but
afterwards
these
cakes
were
given
to
the
poor
or
the
infirm
to
eat
it
was
the
custom
of
the
arkansas
indians
to
offer
the
of
the
ripe
maize
and
melons
to
the
master
of
life
even
children
would
die
of
hunger
rather
than
touch
the
new
fruits
before
this
offering
had
been
made
some
of
the
new
maize
melons
and
other
fruits
were
minced
up
with
the
carcase
of
a
dog
in
the
presence
of
the
old
men
who
alone
were
privileged
to
assist
at
this
solemn
rite
then
after
performing
certain
ceremonies
the
old
men
began
to
dance
and
some
young
girls
wound
up
to
a
pitch
of
frenzy
threw
themselves
on
the
offering
and
bolted
it
in
an
instant
thereupon
the
old
men
seized
the
damsels
and
ducked
them
in
the
river
arkansas
which
had
a
sobering
influence
on
the
minds
of
the
devotees
from
this
account
we
may
perhaps
infer
that
in
eating
the
new
fruits
the
girls
were
believed
to
be
inspired
by
the
master
of
life
who
thus
consumed
the
offering
by
deputy
the
chief
solemnity
of
the
natchez
an
indian
tribe
on
the
lower
mississippi
was
the
harvest
festival
or
the
festival
of
new
fire
an
early
account
of
this
ceremony
has
been
already
submitted
to
the
reader
but
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
add
here
for
comparison
the
later
description
by
chateaubriand
which
differs
from
the
other
in
some
particulars
and
lays
stress
on
the
sacrifice
rather
than
on
the
sacrament
of
according
to
chateaubriand
then
when
the
time
for
the
festival
drew
near
a
crier
went
through
the
villages
calling
upon
the
people
to
prepare
new
vessels
and
new
garments
to
wash
their
houses
and
to
burn
the
old
grain
the
old
garments
and
the
old
utensils
in
a
common
fire
he
also
proclaimed
an
amnesty
to
criminals
next
day
he
appeared
again
commanding
the
people
to
fast
for
three
days
to
abstain
from
all
pleasures
and
to
make
use
of
the
medicine
of
purification
thereupon
all
the
people
took
some
drops
extracted
from
a
root
which
they
called
the
root
of
it
was
a
kind
of
plantain
and
distilled
a
red
liquor
which
acted
as
a
violent
emetic
during
their
three
days
fast
the
people
kept
silence
at
the
end
of
it
the
crier
proclaimed
that
the
festival
would
begin
on
the
following
day
so
next
morning
as
soon
as
it
began
to
grow
light
in
the
sky
the
people
streamed
from
all
quarters
towards
the
temple
of
the
sun
the
temple
was
a
large
building
with
two
doors
one
opening
to
the
east
the
other
to
the
west
on
this
morning
the
eastern
door
of
the
temple
stood
open
facing
the
eastern
door
was
an
altar
placed
so
as
to
catch
the
first
beams
of
the
rising
sun
an
image
of
a
a
small
marsupial
stood
upon
the
altar
on
its
right
was
an
image
of
a
rattlesnake
on
its
left
an
image
of
a
marmoset
before
these
images
a
fire
of
burned
perpetually
once
a
year
only
on
the
eve
of
the
harvest
festival
was
the
sacred
flame
suffered
to
die
out
to
the
right
of
the
altar
on
the
morning
of
this
holy
day
stood
the
great
chief
who
took
his
title
and
traced
his
descent
from
the
sun
to
the
left
of
the
altar
stood
his
wife
round
them
were
grouped
according
to
their
ranks
the
war
chiefs
the
sachems
the
heralds
and
the
young
braves
in
front
of
the
altar
were
piled
bundles
of
dry
reeds
stacked
in
concentric
rings
the
high
priest
standing
on
the
threshold
of
the
temple
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
eastern
horizon
before
presiding
at
the
festival
he
had
to
plunge
thrice
into
the
mississippi
in
his
hands
he
held
two
pieces
of
dry
wood
which
he
kept
rubbing
slowly
against
each
other
muttering
magic
words
at
his
side
two
acolytes
held
two
cups
filled
with
a
kind
of
black
sherbet
all
the
women
their
backs
turned
to
the
east
each
leaning
with
one
hand
on
her
rude
mattock
and
supporting
her
infant
with
the
other
stood
in
a
great
semicircle
at
the
gate
of
the
temple
profound
silence
reigned
throughout
the
multitude
while
the
priest
watched
attentively
the
growing
light
in
the
east
as
soon
as
the
diffused
light
of
dawn
began
to
be
shot
with
beams
of
fire
he
quickened
the
motion
of
the
two
pieces
of
wood
which
he
held
in
his
hands
and
at
the
moment
when
the
upper
edge
of
the
sun
s
disc
appeared
above
the
horizon
fire
flashed
from
the
wood
and
was
caught
in
tinder
at
the
same
instant
the
women
outside
the
temple
faced
round
and
held
up
their
infants
and
their
mattocks
to
the
rising
sun
the
great
chief
and
his
wife
now
drank
the
black
liquor
the
priests
kindled
the
circle
of
dried
reeds
fire
was
set
to
the
heap
of
on
the
altar
and
from
this
sacred
flame
all
the
hearths
of
the
village
were
rekindled
no
sooner
were
the
circles
of
reeds
consumed
than
the
chief
s
wife
came
from
the
temple
and
placing
herself
at
the
head
of
the
women
marched
in
procession
to
the
whither
the
men
were
not
allowed
to
follow
them
they
went
to
gather
the
first
sheaves
of
maize
and
returned
to
the
temple
bearing
them
on
their
heads
some
of
the
sheaves
they
presented
to
the
high
priest
who
laid
them
on
the
altar
others
they
used
to
bake
the
unleavened
bread
which
was
to
be
eaten
in
the
evening
the
eastern
door
of
the
sanctuary
was
now
closed
and
the
western
door
was
opened
when
day
began
to
decline
the
multitude
assembled
once
more
at
the
temple
this
time
at
its
western
gate
where
they
formed
a
great
crescent
with
the
horns
turned
towards
the
west
the
unleavened
bread
was
held
up
and
presented
to
the
setting
sun
and
a
priest
struck
up
a
hymn
in
praise
of
his
descending
light
when
darkness
had
fallen
the
whole
plain
twinkled
with
fires
round
which
the
people
feasted
and
the
sounds
of
music
and
revelry
broke
the
silence
of
night
chapter
xii
homoeopathic
magic
of
a
flesh
diet
the
practice
of
killing
a
god
has
now
been
traced
amongst
peoples
who
have
reached
the
agricultural
stage
of
society
we
have
seen
that
the
spirit
of
the
corn
or
of
other
cultivated
plants
is
commonly
represented
either
in
human
or
in
animal
form
and
that
in
some
places
a
custom
has
prevailed
of
killing
annually
either
the
human
or
the
animal
representative
of
the
god
one
reason
for
thus
killing
the
in
the
person
of
his
representative
has
been
given
implicitly
in
an
earlier
part
of
this
work
we
may
suppose
that
the
intention
was
to
guard
him
or
her
for
the
is
often
feminine
from
the
enfeeblement
of
old
age
by
transferring
the
spirit
while
still
hale
and
hearty
to
the
person
of
a
youthful
and
vigorous
successor
apart
from
the
desirability
of
renewing
his
divine
energies
the
death
of
the
may
have
been
deemed
inevitable
under
the
sickles
or
the
knives
of
the
reapers
and
his
worshippers
may
accordingly
have
felt
bound
to
acquiesce
in
the
sad
necessity
but
further
we
have
found
a
widespread
custom
of
eating
the
god
sacramentally
either
in
the
shape
of
the
man
or
animal
who
represents
the
god
or
in
the
shape
of
bread
made
in
human
or
animal
form
the
reasons
for
thus
partaking
of
the
body
of
the
god
are
from
the
primitive
standpoint
simple
enough
the
savage
commonly
believes
that
by
eating
the
flesh
of
an
animal
or
man
he
acquires
not
only
the
physical
but
even
the
moral
and
intellectual
qualities
which
were
characteristic
of
that
animal
or
man
so
when
the
creature
is
deemed
divine
our
simple
savage
naturally
expects
to
absorb
a
portion
of
its
divinity
along
with
its
material
substance
it
may
be
well
to
illustrate
by
instances
this
common
faith
in
the
acquisition
of
virtues
or
vices
of
many
kinds
through
the
medium
of
animal
food
even
when
there
is
no
pretence
that
the
viands
consist
of
the
body
or
blood
of
a
god
the
doctrine
forms
part
of
the
widely
ramified
system
of
sympathetic
or
homoeopathic
magic
thus
for
example
the
creeks
cherokee
and
kindred
tribes
of
north
american
indians
believe
that
nature
is
possest
of
such
a
property
as
to
transfuse
into
men
and
animals
the
qualities
either
of
the
food
they
use
or
of
those
objects
that
are
presented
to
their
senses
he
who
feeds
on
venison
is
according
to
their
physical
system
swifter
and
more
sagacious
than
the
man
who
lives
on
the
flesh
of
the
clumsy
bear
or
helpless
dunghill
fowls
the
tame
cattle
or
the
heavy
wallowing
swine
this
is
the
reason
that
several
of
their
old
men
recommend
and
say
that
formerly
their
greatest
chieftains
observed
a
constant
rule
in
their
diet
and
seldom
ate
of
any
animal
of
a
gross
quality
or
heavy
motion
of
body
fancying
it
conveyed
a
dullness
through
the
whole
system
and
disabled
them
from
exerting
themselves
with
proper
vigour
in
their
martial
civil
and
religious
the
zaparo
indians
of
ecuador
will
unless
from
necessity
in
most
cases
not
eat
any
heavy
meats
such
as
tapir
and
peccary
but
confine
themselves
to
birds
monkeys
deer
fish
principally
because
they
argue
that
the
heavier
meats
make
them
unwieldy
like
the
animals
who
supply
the
flesh
impeding
their
agility
and
unfitting
them
for
the
similarly
some
of
the
brazilian
indians
would
eat
no
beast
bird
or
fish
that
ran
flew
or
swam
slowly
lest
by
partaking
of
its
flesh
they
should
lose
their
agility
and
be
unable
to
escape
from
their
enemies
the
caribs
abstained
from
the
flesh
of
pigs
lest
it
should
cause
them
to
have
small
eyes
like
pigs
and
they
refused
to
partake
of
tortoises
from
a
fear
that
if
they
did
so
they
would
become
heavy
and
stupid
like
the
animal
among
the
fans
of
west
africa
men
in
the
prime
of
life
never
eat
tortoises
for
a
similar
reason
they
imagine
that
if
they
did
so
their
vigour
and
fleetness
of
foot
would
be
gone
but
old
men
may
eat
tortoises
freely
because
having
already
lost
the
power
of
running
they
can
take
no
harm
from
the
flesh
of
the
creature
some
of
the
chiriguanos
of
eastern
bolivia
would
not
touch
the
flesh
of
the
vicuña
because
they
imagined
that
if
they
ate
it
they
would
become
woolly
like
the
vicuña
on
the
other
hand
the
abipones
of
paraguay
ate
the
flesh
of
jaguars
in
order
to
acquire
the
courage
of
the
beast
indeed
the
number
of
jaguars
which
they
consumed
for
this
object
is
said
to
have
been
very
great
and
with
a
like
intent
they
eagerly
devoured
the
flesh
of
bulls
stags
boars
and
being
persuaded
that
by
frequently
partaking
of
such
food
they
increased
their
strength
activity
and
courage
on
the
other
hand
they
all
abhorred
the
thought
of
eating
hens
eggs
sheep
fish
and
tortoises
because
they
believed
that
these
tender
viands
begot
sloth
and
listlessness
in
their
bodies
and
cowardice
in
their
minds
the
thompson
indians
of
british
columbia
would
not
eat
the
heart
of
the
nor
would
they
allow
their
dogs
to
devour
the
bird
lest
they
should
grow
foolish
like
the
bird
while
many
savages
thus
fear
to
eat
the
flesh
of
animals
lest
they
should
themselves
become
the
bushmen
of
south
africa
purposely
ate
the
flesh
of
such
creatures
and
the
reason
which
they
gave
for
doing
so
exhibits
a
curious
refinement
of
savage
philosophy
they
imagined
that
the
game
which
they
pursued
would
be
influenced
sympathetically
by
the
food
in
the
body
of
the
hunter
so
that
if
he
had
eaten
of
animals
the
quarry
would
be
also
and
would
escape
him
whereas
if
he
had
eaten
of
animals
the
quarry
would
also
be
and
he
would
be
able
to
overtake
and
kill
it
for
that
reason
hunters
of
gemsbok
particularly
avoided
eating
the
flesh
of
the
swift
and
agile
springbok
indeed
they
would
not
even
touch
it
with
their
hands
because
they
believed
the
springbok
to
be
a
very
lively
creature
which
did
not
go
to
sleep
at
night
and
they
thought
that
if
they
ate
springbok
the
gemsbok
which
they
hunted
would
likewise
not
be
willing
to
go
to
sleep
even
at
night
how
then
could
they
catch
it
certain
tribes
on
the
upper
zambesi
believe
in
transmigration
and
every
man
in
his
lifetime
chooses
the
kind
of
animal
whose
body
he
wishes
at
death
to
enter
he
then
performs
an
initiatory
rite
which
consists
in
swallowing
the
maggots
bred
in
the
putrid
carcase
of
the
animal
of
his
choice
thenceforth
he
partakes
of
that
animal
s
nature
and
on
the
occasion
of
a
calamity
while
the
women
are
giving
themselves
up
to
lamentation
you
will
see
one
man
writhing
on
the
ground
like
a
boa
constrictor
or
a
crocodile
another
howling
and
leaping
like
a
panther
a
third
baying
like
a
jackal
roaring
like
a
lion
or
grunting
like
a
hippopotamus
all
of
them
imitating
the
characters
of
the
various
animals
to
perfection
clearly
these
people
imagine
that
the
soul
or
vital
essence
of
the
animal
is
manifested
in
the
maggots
bred
in
its
decaying
carcase
hence
they
imagine
that
by
swallowing
the
maggots
they
imbue
themselves
with
the
very
life
and
spirit
of
the
creature
which
they
desire
to
become
the
namaquas
abstain
from
eating
the
flesh
of
hares
because
they
think
it
would
make
them
as
a
hare
but
they
eat
the
flesh
of
the
lion
or
drink
the
blood
of
the
leopard
or
lion
to
get
the
courage
and
strength
of
these
beasts
the
bushmen
will
not
give
their
children
a
jackal
s
heart
to
eat
lest
it
should
make
them
timid
like
the
jackal
but
they
give
them
a
leopard
s
heart
to
eat
to
make
them
brave
like
the
leopard
when
a
wagogo
man
of
german
east
africa
kills
a
lion
he
eats
the
heart
in
order
to
become
brave
like
a
lion
but
he
thinks
that
to
eat
the
heart
of
a
hen
would
make
him
timid
among
the
a
tribe
of
nilotic
negroes
young
men
eat
the
flesh
of
leopards
in
order
to
make
themselves
fierce
in
war
the
flesh
of
the
lion
and
also
that
of
the
spotted
leopard
are
sometimes
cooked
and
eaten
by
native
warriors
in
africa
who
hope
thereby
to
become
as
brave
as
lions
when
a
zulu
army
assembles
to
go
forth
to
battle
the
warriors
eat
slices
of
meat
which
is
smeared
with
a
powder
made
of
the
dried
flesh
of
various
animals
such
as
the
leopard
lion
elephant
snakes
and
so
on
for
thus
it
is
thought
that
the
soldiers
will
acquire
the
bravery
and
other
warlike
qualities
of
these
animals
sometimes
if
a
zulu
has
killed
a
wild
beast
for
instance
a
leopard
he
will
give
his
children
the
blood
to
drink
and
will
roast
the
heart
for
them
to
eat
expecting
that
they
will
thus
grow
up
brave
and
daring
men
but
others
say
that
this
is
dangerous
because
it
is
apt
to
produce
courage
without
prudence
and
to
make
a
man
rush
heedlessly
on
his
death
among
the
wabondei
of
eastern
africa
the
heart
of
a
lion
or
leopard
is
eaten
with
the
intention
of
making
the
eater
strong
and
brave
in
british
central
africa
aspirants
after
courage
consume
the
flesh
and
especially
the
hearts
of
lions
while
lecherous
persons
eat
the
testicles
of
goats
among
the
suk
of
british
east
africa
the
fat
and
heart
of
a
lion
are
sometimes
given
to
children
to
eat
in
order
that
they
may
become
strong
but
they
are
not
allowed
to
know
what
they
are
eating
arab
women
in
north
africa
give
their
male
children
a
piece
of
a
lion
s
heart
to
eat
to
make
them
fearless
the
flesh
of
an
elephant
is
thought
by
the
peoples
of
west
africa

that
had
outlived
nine
generations
of
men
in
antiquity
the
flesh
of
deer
and
crows
was
eaten
for
other
purposes
than
that
of
prolonging
life
as
deer
were
supposed
not
to
suffer
from
fever
some
women
used
to
taste
venison
every
morning
and
it
is
said
that
in
consequence
they
lived
to
a
great
age
without

ancient
diviners
sought
to
imbue
themselves
with
the
spirit
of
prophecy
by
swallowing
vital
portions
of
birds
and
beasts
of
omen
for
example
they
thought
that
by

the
hearts
of

or
hawks
they
took
into
their
bodies
along
with
the
flesh

prophetic
soul
of

the
dyaks
of
borneo
young
men
and
warriors
may
not
eat
venison
because
it
would
make
them
as
timid
as
deer
but
the
women
and
very
old
men
are
free
to
eat
it
however
among
the
kayans
of
the
same
region
who
share
the
same
view
as
to
the
ill
effect
of
eating
venison
men
will
partake
of
the
dangerous
viand
provided
it
is
cooked
in
the
open
air
for
then
the
timid
spirit
of
the
animal
is
supposed
to
escape
at
once
into
the
jungle
and
not
to
enter
into
the
eater
the
aino
of
japan
think
that
the
otter
is
a
very
forgetful
animal
and
they
often
call
a
person
with
a
bad
memory
an
otter
therefore
it
is
a
rule
with
them
that
the
otter
s
head
must
not
lightly
be
used
as
an
article
of
food
for
unless
people
are
very
careful
they
will
if
they
eat
it
become
as
forgetful
as
that
creature
and
hence
it
happens
that
when
an
otter
has
been
killed
the
people
do
not
usually
eat
the
head
but
if
they
are
seized
with
a
very
strong
desire
for
a
feast
of
otter
s
head
they
may
partake
thereof
providing
proper
precautions
are
taken
when
eating
it
the
people
must
take
their
swords
knives
axes
bows
and
arrows
and
pipes
trays
cups
garden
tools
and
everything
they
possess
tie
them
up
in
bundles
with
carrying
slings
and
sit
with
them
attached
to
their
heads
while
in
the
act
of
eating
this
feast
may
be
partaken
of
in
this
way
and
no
other
if
this
method
be
carefully
adhered
to
there
will
be
no
danger
of
forgetting
where
a
thing
has
been
placed
otherwise
loss
of
memory
will
be
the
on
the
other
hand
the
aino
believe
that
the
heart
of
the
is
exceedingly
wise
and
that
in
speech
the
bird
is
most
eloquent
therefore
whenever
he
is
killed
he
should
be
at
once
torn
open
and
his
heart
wrenched
out
and
swallowed
before
it
has
time
to
grow
cold
or
suffer
damage
of
any
kind
if
a
man
swallows
it
thus
he
will
become
very
fluent
and
wise

will
be
able

argue
down
all
his

a
feast
used
to
be
held
in
the

and
the
principal
dish
was

said
the

the
animal
who
is
so
brave
that
he
will
let
himself
be
cut
in
pieces
in

of
his

inspire
valour
on
extraordinary
occasions
the
bravest
warriors
of
the
dacotas
used
to
perform
a
dance
at
which
they
devoured
the

of

raw
and
warm
in

thereby
to
acquire
the
sagacity
and
bravery
of
the

the
animals
were
thrown
to
them
alive
killed
and
cut
open
then
the
livers
were
extracted
cut
into
strips

hung
on

each

grabbed
at
a
strip
of
liver
with

and

the
so

sometimes
procure
the
of

the
similkameen
indians
of
british
columbia
imagine
that
to
eat
the
heart
of
a
bear
inspires
courage
in
norse
legend
ingiald
son
of
king
aunund
was
timid
in
his
youth
but
after
eating
the
heart
of
a
wolf
he
became
very
bold
hialto
gained
strength
and
courage
by
eating
the
heart
of
a
bear
and
drinking
its
blood
and
when
sigurd
killed
the
dragon
fafnir
and
tasted
his
heart
s
blood
he
acquired
thereby
a
knowledge
of
the
language
of
birds
the
belief
that
the
language
of
birds
or
of
animals
in
general
can
be
learned
by
eating
some
part
of
a
serpent
appears
to
be
ancient
and
democritus
is
reported
to
have
said
that
serpents
were
generated
from
the
mixed
blood
of
certain
birds
and
that
therefore
whoever
ate
a
serpent
would
understand
the
bird
language
the
arabs
in
antiquity
were
supposed
to
be
able
to
draw
omens
from
birds
because
they
had
gained
a
knowledge
of
the
bird
language
by
eating
either
the
heart
or
liver
of
a
serpent
and
the
people
of
paraka
in
india
are
said
to
have
learned
the
language
of
animals
in
general
by
the
same
means
saxo
grammaticus
relates
how
rollo
acquired
all
knowledge
including
an
understanding
of
the
speech
of
animals
both
wild
and
tame
by
eating
of
a
black
serpent
in
norway
sweden
and
jutland
down
to
the
nineteenth
century
the
flesh
of
a
white
snake
was
thought
to
confer
supernatural
wisdom
on
the
eater
it
is
a
german
and
bohemian
superstition
that
whoever
eats
serpent
s
flesh
understands
the
language
of
animals
notions
of
the
same
sort
based
no
doubt
on
a
belief
in
the
extraordinary
wisdom
or
subtlety
of
the
serpent
often
meet
us
in
popular
tales
and
traditions
in
morocco
lethargic
patients
are
given
ants
to
swallow
and
to
eat
lion
s
flesh
will
make
a
coward
brave
but
people
abstain
from
eating
the
hearts
of
fowls
lest
thereby
they
should
be
rendered
timid
when
a
child
is
late
in
learning
to
speak
the
turks
of
central
asia
will
give
it
the
tongues
of
certain
birds
to
eat
a
north
american
indian
thought
that
brandy
must
be
a
decoction
of
hearts
and
tongues
because
said
he
after
drinking
it
i
fear
nothing
and
i
talk
in
java
there
is
a
tiny
earthworm
which
now
and
then
utters
a
shrill
sound
like
that
of
the
alarum
of
a
small
clock
hence
when
a
public
dancing
girl
has
screamed
herself
hoarse
in
the
exercise
of
her
calling
the
leader
of
the
troop
makes
her
eat
some
of
these
worms
in
the
belief
that
thus
she
will
regain
her
voice
and
will
after
swallowing
them
be
able
to
scream
as
shrilly
as
ever
the
people
of
darfur
in
central
africa
think
that
the
liver
is
the
seat
of
the
soul
and
that
a
man
may
enlarge
his
soul
by
eating
the
liver
of
an
animal
whenever
an
animal
is
killed
its
liver
is
taken
out
and
eaten
but
the
people
are
most
careful
not
to
touch
it
with
their
hands
as
it
is
considered
sacred
it
is
cut
up
in
small
pieces
and
eaten
raw
the
bits
being
conveyed
to
the
mouth
on
the
point
of
a
knife
or
the
sharp
point
of
a
stick
any
one
who
may
accidentally
touch
the
liver
is
strictly
forbidden
to
partake
of
it
which
prohibition
is
regarded
as
a
great
misfortune
for
women
are
not
allowed
to
eat
liver
because
they
have
no
soul
again
the
flesh
and
blood
of
dead
men
are
commonly
eaten
and
drunk
to
inspire
bravery
wisdom
or
other
qualities
for
which
the
men
themselves
were
remarkable
or
which
are
supposed
to
have
their
special
seat
in
the
particular
part
eaten
thus
among
the
mountain
tribes
of
africa
there
are
ceremonies
by
which
the
youths
are
formed
into
guilds
or
lodges
and
among
the
rites
of
initiation
there
is
one
which
is
intended
to
infuse
courage
intelligence
and
other
qualities
into
the
novices
whenever
an
enemy
who
has
behaved
with
conspicuous
bravery
is
killed
his
liver
which
is
considered
the
seat
of
valour
his
ears
which
are
supposed
to
be
the
seat
of
intelligence
the
skin
of
his
forehead
which
is
regarded
as
the
seat
of
perseverance
his
testicles
which
are
held
to
be
the
seat
of
strength
and
other
members
which
are
viewed
as
the
seat
of
other
virtues
are
cut
from
his
body
and
baked
to
cinders
the
ashes
are
carefully
kept
in
the
horn
of
a
bull
and
during
the
ceremonies
observed
at
circumcision
are
mixed
with
other
ingredients
into
a
kind
of
paste
which
is
administered
by
the
tribal
priest
to
the
youths
by
this
means
the
strength
valour
intelligence
and
other
virtues
of
the
slain
are
believed
to
be
imparted
to
the
eaters
when
basutos
of
the
mountains
have
killed
a
very
brave
foe
they
immediately
cut
out
his
heart
and
eat
it
because
this
is
supposed
to
give
them
his
courage
and
strength
in
battle
at
the
close
of
the
war
the
man
who
has
slain
such
a
foe
is
called
before
the
chief
and
gets
from
the
doctor
a
medicine
which
he
chews
with
his
food
the
third
day
after
this
he
must
wash
his
body
in
running
water
and
at
the
expiry
of
ten
days
he
may
return
to
his
wives
and
children
so
an
ovambo
warrior
in
battle
will
tear
out
the
heart
of
his
slain
foe
in
the
belief
that
by
eating
it
he
can
acquire
the
bravery
of
the
dead
man
a
similar
belief
and
practice
prevail
among
some
of
the
tribes
of
british
central
africa
notably
among
the
angoni
these
tribes
also
mutilate
the
dead
and
reduce
the
severed
parts
to
ashes
afterwards
the
ashes
are
stirred
into
a
broth
or
gruel
which
must
be
lapped
up
with
the
hand
and
thrown
into
the
mouth
but
not
eaten
as
ordinary
food
is
taken
to
give
the
soldiers
courage
perseverance
fortitude
strategy
patience
and
in
former
times
whenever
a
nandi
warrior
killed
an
enemy
he
used
to
eat
a
morsel
of
the
dead
man
s
heart
to
make
himself
brave
the
wagogo
of
german
east
africa
do
the
same
thing
for
the
same
purpose
when
sir
charles
m
carthy
was
killed
by
the
ashantees
in
it
is
said
that
his
heart
was
devoured
by
the
chiefs
of
the
ashantee
army
who
hoped
by
this
means
to
imbibe
his
courage
his
flesh
was
dried
and
parcelled
out
among
the
lower
officers
for
the
same
purpose
and
his
bones
were
long
kept
at
coomassie
as
national
fetishes
the
amazons
of
dahomey
used
to
eat
the
hearts
of
foes
remarkable
for
their
bravery
in
order
that
some
of
the
intrepidity
which
animated
them
might
be
transfused
into
the
eaters
in
former
days
if
report
may
be
trusted
the
hearts
of
enemies
who
enjoyed
a
reputation
for
sagacity
were
also
eaten
for
the
negro
of
these
regions
holds
that
the
heart
is
the
seat
of
the
intellect
as
well
as
of
courage
among
the
negroes
of
the
slave
coast
the
priests
of
ogun
the
usually
take
out
the
hearts
of
human
victims
which
are
then
dried
crumbled
to
powder
mixed
with
rum
and
sold
to
aspirants
after
courage
who
swallow
the
mixture
in
the
belief
that
they
thereby
absorb
the
manly
virtue
of
which
the
heart
is
supposed
to
be
the
seat
similarly
indians
of
the
orinoco
region
used
to
toast
the
hearts
of
their
enemies
grind
them
to
powder
and
then
drink
the
powder
in
a
liquid
in
order
to
be
brave
and
valiant
the
next
time
they
went
forth
to
fight
the
nauras
indians
of
new
granada
ate
the
hearts
of
spaniards
when
they
had
the
opportunity
hoping
thereby
to
make
themselves
as
dauntless
as
the
dreaded
castilian
chivalry
the
sioux
indians
of
north
america
used
to
reduce
to
powder
the
heart
of
a
valiant
enemy
and
swallow
the
powder
hoping
thus
to
appropriate
the
dead
man
s
valour
the
muskoghees
also
thought
that
to
eat
the
heart
of
a
foe
would
communicate
and
give
greater
heart
against
the
enemy
they
also
think
that
the
vigorous
faculties
of
the
mind
are
derived
from
the
brain
on
which
account
i
have
seen
some
of
their
heroes
drink
out
of
a
human
skull
they
imagine
they
only
imbibe
the
good
qualities
it
formerly
for
a
similar
reason
in
uganda
a
priest
used
to
drink
beer
out
of
the
skull
of
a
dead
king
in
order
that
he
might
be
possessed
by
the
king
s
spirit
among
the
esquimaux
of
bering
strait
when
young
men
had
slain
an
enemy
for
the
first
time
in
war
they
were
wont
to
drink
some
of
the
blood
and
to
eat
a
small
piece
of
the
heart
of
their
victim
in
order
to
increase
their
bravery
in
some
tribes
of
australia
when
a
man
dies
who
had
been
a
great
warrior
or
hunter
his
friends
cut
out
the
fat
about
his
heart
and
eat
it
because
they
believe
that
it
imparts
to
them
the
courage
and
cunning
of
the
deceased
but
while
the
human
heart
is
thus
commonly
eaten
for
the
sake
of
imbuing
the
eater
with
the
qualities
of
its
original
owner
it
is
not
as
we
have
already
seen
the
only
part
of
the
body
which
is
consumed
for
this
purpose
thus
in
new
caledonia
the
victors
in
a
fight
used
to
eat
the
bodies
of
the
slain
not
as
might
be
supposed
from
a
taste
for
human
flesh
but
in
order
to
assimilate
part
of
the
bravery
which
the
deceased
was
supposed
to
among
the
tribes
about
maryborough
in
queensland
when
a
man
was
killed
in
a
ceremonial
fight
it
was
customary
for
his
friends
to
skin
and
eat
him
in
order
that
his
warlike
virtues
might
pass
into
the
eaters
warriors
of
the
theddora
and
ngarigo
tribes
in
australia
used
to
eat
the
hands
and
feet
of
their
slain
enemies
believing
that
in
this
way
they
acquired
some
of
the
qualities
and
courage
of
the
dead
in
the
dieri
tribe
of
central
australia
when
a

also
there
is
a
popular
superstition
that
the

makes
brave

who
partake

hence
when
a
catholic
missionary
was
beheaded
in

in

cut
out
the
liver
of
his

and
ate
part
of
it

like
intent

eat

the

matuana
drank
the
gall
of
thirty
chiefs
whose
people
he
had
destroyed
in
the
belief
that
it
would
make
him
strong
it
is
a
zulu
fancy
that
by
eating
the
centre
of
the
forehead
and
the
eyebrow
of
an
enemy
they
acquire
the
power
of
looking
steadfastly
at
a
foe
in
tud
or
warrior
island

men
would
drink
the
sweat
of
renowned
warriors
and
eat
the
scrapings
from
their
which
had
become
coated
and
sodden
with
human
blood
this
was
done
to
make
strong
and
like
stone
no

nagir
another
island
of
torres

in
order
to
infuse
courage
into

a
warrior
used
to
take
the
eye
and
tongue
of
a
man
whom
he
had
killed
and
after
mincing
them
and
mixing
them
with
his
urine
he
administered
the
compound
to
the
boy
who
received
it
with
shut
eyes
and
open

seated
between

s
legs
before

warlike
expedition
the
people
of
minahassa
in
celebes
used
to
take
the
locks
of
hair
of
a
slain
foe
and
dabble
them
in
boiling
water
to
extract
the
courage
this
infusion
of
bravery
was
then
drunk
by
the
warriors
in
new
zealand
the
chief
was
an
god
but
there
were
powerful
and
powerless
gods
each
naturally
sought
to
make
himself
one
of
the
former
the
plan
therefore
adopted
was
to
incorporate
the
spirits
of
others
with
their
own
thus
when
a
warrior
slew
a
chief
he
immediately
gouged
out
his
eyes
and
swallowed
them
the
or
divinity
being
supposed
to
reside
in
that
organ
thus
he
not
only
killed
the
body
but
also
possessed
himself
of
the
soul
of
his
enemy
and
consequently
the
more
chiefs
he
slew
the
greater
did
his
divinity
even
without
absorbing
any
part
of
a
man
s
bodily
substance
it
is
sometimes
thought
possible
to
acquire
his
moral
virtues
through
simple
contact
with
his
bones
thus
among
the
toradjas
of
central
celebes
when
a
youth
is
being
circumcised
he
is
made
to
sit
on
the
skull
of
a
slain
foe
in
order
to
make
him
brave
in
war
and
when
scanderbeg
prince
of
epirus
was
dead
the
turks
who
had
often
felt
the
force
of
his
arm
in
battle
are
said
to
have
imagined
that
by
wearing
a
piece
of
his
bones
near
their
heart
they
should
be
animated
with
a
strength
and
valour
like
his
a
peculiar
form
of
communion
with
the
dead
is
practised
by
the
gallas
of
eastern
africa
they
think
that
food
from
the
house
of
a
dead
man
especially
food
that
he
liked
or
that
he
cooked
for
himself
contains
a
portion
of
his
life
or
soul
if
at
the
funeral
feast
a
man
eats
some
of
that
food
he
fancies
that
he
has
thereby
absorbed
some
of
the
life
or
soul
of
the
departed
a
portion
of
his
spirit
intelligence
or
courage
strange
as
it
may
seem
to
us
one
motive
which
induces
a
savage
warrior
to
eat
the
flesh
or
drink
the
blood
of
the
foe
whom
he
has
slain
appears
to
be
a
wish
to
form
an
indissoluble
covenant
of
friendship
and
brotherhood
with
his
victim
for
it
is
a
widespread
belief
among
savages
that
by
transfusing
a
little
of
their
blood
into
each
other
s
bodies
two
men
become
kinsmen
and
allies
the
same
blood
now
circulating
in
the
veins
of
both
neither
can
injure
the
other
without
at
the
same
time
injuring
himself
the
two
have
therefore
given
each
other
the
strongest
bond
the
best
possible
hostages
for
their
good
behaviour
acting
on
this
theory
the
primitive
warrior
seeks
to
convert
his
slain
foe
into
the
firmest
of
friends
by
imbibing
the
dead
man
s
blood
or
swallowing
his
flesh
that
at
all
events
appears
to
be
the
idea
at
the
root
of
the
following
customs
when
an
arawak
indian
of
british
guiana
has
murdered
another
he
repairs
on
the
third
night
to
the
grave
of
his
victim
and
pressing
a
pointed
stick
through
the
corpse
he
licks
off
and
swallows
any
blood
that
he
finds
adhering
to
the
stick
for
he
believes
that
if
he
did
not
taste
his
victim
s
blood
he
would
go
mad
and
die
whereas
by
swallowing
the
blood
he
averts
any
ill
consequences
that
might
flow
to
him
from
the
murder
the
belief
and
practice
of
the
nandi
are
similar
to
the
present
day
when
a
person
of
another
tribe
has
been
slain
by
a
nandi
the
blood
must
be
carefully
washed
off
the
spear
or
sword
into
a
cup
made
of
grass
and
drunk
by
the
slayer
if
this
is
not
done
it
is
thought
that
the
man
will
become
so
among
the
tribes
of
the
lower
niger
it
is
customary
and
necessary
for
the
executioner
to
lick
the
blood
that
is
on
the
blade
moreover
the
custom
of
licking
the
blood
off
the
blade
of
a
sword
by
which
a
man
has
been
killed
in
war
is
common
to
all
these
tribes
and
the
explanation
given
me
by
the
ibo
which
is
generally
accepted
is
that
if
this
was
not
done
the
act
of
killing
would
so
affect
the
strikers
as
to
cause
them
to
run
amok
among
their
own
people
because
the
sight
and
smell
of
blood
render
them
absolutely
senseless
as
well
as
regardless
of
all
consequences
and
this
licking
the
blood
is
the
only
sure
remedy
and
the
only
way
in
which
they
can
recover
among
the
shans
executioners
believe
that
they
would
soon
fall
ill
and
die
if
they
did
not
taste
the
blood
of
their
victims
the
most
probable
explanation
of
these
practices
seems
to
be
that
a
manslayer
is
thought
to
be
driven
mad
by
the
ghost
of
his
victim
who
takes
possession
of
his
murderer
s
body
and
causes
him
to
demean
himself
in
a
frantic
manner
whereas
as
soon
as
the
slayer
has
tasted
the
blood
of
the
slain
he
becomes
a
of
his
victim
whose
ghost
accordingly
will
do
him
no
harm
this
hypothesis
is
strongly
confirmed
by
the
reason
alleged
for
a
similar
custom
formerly
observed
by
the
maoris
when
a
warrior
had
slain
his
foe
in
combat
he
tasted
his
blood
believing
that
this
preserved
him
from
the
avenging
spirit
of
his
victim
for
they
imagined
that
the
moment
a
slayer
had
tasted
the
blood
of
the
slain
the
dead
man
became
a
part
of
his
being
and
placed
him
under
the
protection
of
the
or
of
the
in
the
light
of
these
facts
we
can
now
explain
the
opinion
still
widely
held
in
calabria
that
if
a
murderer
is
to
escape
he
must
suck
his
victim
s
blood
from
the
reeking
blade
of
the
dagger
with
which
he
did
the
deed
and
further
we
can
see
at
least
a
glimmering
of
reason
however
misapplied
in
the
confidence
cherished
by
the
botocudos
of
brazil
that
if
only
they
ate
a
morsel
of
the
flesh
of
their
enemies
the
arrows
of
the
fellow
tribesmen
of
the
slain
would
not
be
able
to
hit
them
indeed
the
evidence
which
i
have
just
adduced
suggests
that
the
intention
of
forming
a
with
the
dead
may
have
been
a
common
motive
for
the
cannibalism
which
has
been
so
often
practised
by
savage
victors
on
the
bodies
of
their
victims
if
that
was
so
it
would
to
some
extent
mitigate
the
horror
with
which
such
a
practice
is
naturally
viewed
by
civilised
observers
since
it
would
reveal
the
cannibal
feast
no
longer
in
the
lurid
light
of
a
brutal
outburst
of
blind
rage
and
hatred
against
the
vanquished
but
in
the
milder
aspect
of
a
solemn
rite
designed
to
wipe
out
the
memory
of
past
hostilities
and
to
establish
a
permanent
relation
of
friendship
and
good
fellowship
with
the
dead
another
mode
of
entering
into
communion
with
the
dead
by
means
of
their
bodily
relics
is
to
grind
their
bones
to
powder
or
to
burn
them
to
ashes
and
then
to
swallow
the
powder
or
the
ashes
mixed
with
food
or
drink
this
method
of
absorbing
the
virtues
or
appropriating
the
souls
of
deceased
kinsfolk
has
been
practised
by
a
number
of
indian
tribes
of
south
america
thus
the
tarianas
tucanos
and
other
tribes
in
the
valley
of
the
amazon
about
a
month
after
the
funeral
disinter
the
corpse
which
is
then
much
decomposed
and
put
it
in
a
great
pan
or
oven
over
the
fire
till
all
the
volatile
parts
are
driven
off
with
a
most
horrible
stench
leaving
only
a
black
carbonaceous
paste
this
paste
is
then
pounded
into
a
fine
powder
and
being
mixed
in
several
large
vats
of
the
native
beer
the
liquor
is
drunk
by
the
assembled
company
until
all
is
consumed
they
believe
that
thus
the
virtues
of
the
deceased
are
transmitted
to
the
drinkers
similarly
among
the
xomanas
and
passes
of
the
rio
negro
and
japura
river
in
brazil
it
was
customary
to
burn
the
bones
of
the
dead
and
mingle
the
ashes
in
their
drink
for
they
fancied
that
by
this
means
they
received
into
their
own
bodies
the
spirits
of
their
deceased
we
may
suppose
that
a
similar
motive
underlies
the
custom
wherever
it
has
been
observed
by
the
indians
of
south
america
even
when
this
particular
motive
is
not
expressly
alleged
by
our
authorities
for
example
the
retoroños
pechuyos
and
guarayos
of
eastern
bolivia
manifested
their
feeling
for
the
dead
by
a
remarkable
custom
when
the
body
had
mouldered
they
dug
up
the
bones
reduced
them
to
powder
and
mingling
it
with
maize
composed
a
sort
of
cake
which
they
considered
it
the
strongest
mark
of
friendship
to
offer
and
partake
some
of
the
first
missionaries
were
regaled
with
this
family
bread
before
they
knew
what
they
were
again
in
the
province
of
coro
in
venezuela
when
a
chief
died
they
lamented
him
in
the
night
celebrating
his
actions
then
they
parched
his
body
at
the
fire
and
reducing
it
to
powder
drank
it
up
in
their
liquor
deeming
this
act
the
highest
honour
they
could
pay
him
the
tauaré
indians
of
the
rio
enivra
burn
their
dead
keep
their
ashes
in
hollow
reeds
and
eat
a
portion
of
the
ashes
with
every
meal
so
in
antiquity
artemisia
expressed
her
love
and
grief
for
her
dead
husband
mausolus
by
powdering
his
ashes
and
drinking
them
in
water
it
is
said
that
mwamba
a
recent
king
or
chief
of
the
wemba
in
northern
rhodesia
having
detected
one
of
his
wives
in
an
intrigue
with
another
man
caused
the
guilty
pair
to
be
burned
alive
while
he
watched
their
tortures
from
a
raised
seat
shortly
after
this
however
he
would
seem
to
have
been
stricken
with
remorse
and
the
dread
of
nemesis
the
presiding
was
therefore
ordered
to
collect
the
ashes
of
the
twain
and
decoct
therefrom
a
potion
which
was
administered
to
the
king
to
avert
the
avenging
furies
of
evil
spirits
of
the
murdered
pair
which
might
otherwise
have
hounded
him
into
a
fit
of
by
drinking
the
ashes
of
his
victims
the
king
sought
to
identify
himself
with
them
and
so
to
protect
himself
against
their
angry
ghosts
just
as
we
have
seen
that
manslayers
seek
to
protect
themselves
against
the
ghosts
of
their
victims
by
drinking
their
blood
just
as
the
savage
thinks
that
he
can
swallow
the
moral
and
other
virtues
in
the
shape
of
food
so
he
fondly
imagines
that
he
can
inoculate
himself
with
them
here
in
europe
we
as
yet
inoculate
only
against
disease
in
basutoland
they
have
learned
the
art
of
inoculating
not
merely
against
disease
but
against
moral
evil
and
public
calamity
against
wild
beasts
and
winter
cold
for
example
if
an
epidemic
is
raging
if
public
affairs
go
ill
or
war
threatens
to
break
out
the
chief
with
paternal
solicitude
seeks
to
guard
his
people
against
the
evils
that
menace
them
by
inoculating
them
with
his
own
hand
armed
with
a
lancet
he
makes
a
slight
incision
in
the
temples
of
each
one
and
rubs
into
the
wound
a
pinch
of
magic
powder
which
has
been
carefully
compounded
of
the
ashes
of
certain
plants
and
animals
the
plants
and
animals
whose
ashes
compose
this
sovereign
medicine
are
always
symbolical
in
other
words
they
are
supposed
to
be
imbued
with
the
virtues
which
the
chief
desires
to
impart
to
his
people
they
consist
for
example
of
plants
whose
foliage
withstands
the
rigours
of
winter
mimosas
whose
thorns
present
an
impenetrable
barrier
to
all
animals
of
the
deer
kind
the
claws
or
a
few
hairs
from
the
mane
of
a
lion
the
bravest
of
beasts
the
tuft
of
hair
round
the
root
of
the
horns
of
a
bull
which
is
the
emblem
of
strength
and
fecundity
the
skin
of
a
serpent
the
feathers
of
a
kite
or
a
hawk
so
when
the
barotsé
wish
to
be
swift
of
foot
to
cripple
the
fleeing
game
and
to
ensure
an
abundant
catch
they
scarify
their
arms
and
legs
and
rub
into
the
wounds
a
powder
made
of
the
burnt
bones
of
various
beasts
and
birds
among
some
tribes
of
africa
the
same
magic
powder
which
is
made
from
various
parts
of
slain
foes
and
is
eaten
by
boys
at
circumcision
is
used
to
inoculate
the
in
time
of
war
the
makes
an
incision
in
the
forehead
of
each
warrior
and
puts
the
powder
into
the
cut
thus
infusing
strength
and
courage
for
the
battle
among
some
caffre
tribes
the
powdered
charcoal
with
which
the
warriors
are
thus
inoculated
in
various
parts
of
their
bodies
is
procured
by
burning
the
flesh
of
a
live
ox
with
a
certain
kind
of
wood
or
roots
to
which
magic
virtue
is
attributed
the
basutos
think
that
they
can
render
themselves
invulnerable
by
inoculation
and
the
zulus
imagine
that
they
can
protect
themselves
against
by
similar
means
but
the
saving
virtue
of
the
inoculation
is
not
permanent
like
vaccination
it
has
to
be
periodically
renewed
hence
every
year
about
october
zulu
men
women
and
children
have
a
small
piece
of
skin
cut
from
the
back
of
the
left
hand
and
the
poison
of
a
snake
mixed
with
spittle
is
rubbed
into
the
wound
no
snake
will
ever
approach
a
man
who
has
thus
been
inoculated
and
what
is
even
more
curious
if
the
shadow
of
an
inoculated
man
should
touch
the
shadow
of
a
man
who
has
not
been
inoculated
the
latter
will
fall
down
as
if
he
had
been
shot
overcome
by
the
poison
transmitted
through
the
shadow
so
exceedingly
virulent
is
the
virus
among
the
jukos
a
tribe
of
the
benue
river
in
northern
nigeria
before
a
hunter
goes
forth
to
hunt
elephants
he
makes
four
cuts
in
his
left
arm
and
rubs
in
medicine
this
helps
him
to
see
the
beast
next
day
again
the
zulus
know
how
to
inoculate
themselves
not
merely
with
moral
virtue
but
even
with
celestial
power
for
you
must
know
that
the
zulus
have
or
who
drive
away
clouds
big
with
hail
and
lightning
just
as
herdsmen
drive
cattle
before
them
these
are
in
sympathy
with
the
heaven
for
when
the
heaven
is
about
to
be
darkened
and
before
the
clouds
appear
or
the
thunder
mutters
the
heart
of
the
feels
it
coming
for
it
is
hot
within
him
and
he
is
excited
by
anger
when
the
sky
begins
to
be
overcast
he
too
grows
dark
like
it
when
it
thunders
he
frowns
that
his
face
may
be
black
as
the
scowl
of
the
angry
heaven
now
the
way
in
which
he
thus
becomes
sympathetic
with
all
the
changing
moods
of
the
inconstant
heaven
is
this
he
eats
the
heaven
and
scarifies
himself
with
it
and
the
way
in
which
he
eats
the
heaven
and
scarifies
himself
with
it
is
as
follows
when
a
bullock
is
struck
by
lightning
the
wizard
takes
its
flesh
and
puts
it
in
a
sherd
and
eats
it
while
it
is
hot
mixed
with
medicine
and
thus
he
eats
the
heaven
by
eating
the
flesh
which
came
from
the
beast
which
was
struck
by
the
lightning
which
came
down
from
the
heaven
and
in
like
manner
he
scarifies
himself
with
the
heaven
for
he
makes
cuts
in
his
body
and
rubs
in
medicine
mixed
with
the
flesh
of
a
bullock
that
was
struck
by
lightning
in
some
caffre
tribes
when
an
animal
or
a
man
has
been
struck
by
lightning
the
priest
comes
straightway
and
vaccinates
every
person
in
the
kraal
apparently
as
a
sort
of
insurance
against
lightning
he
sets
to
work
by
tying
a
number
of
charms
round
the
neck
of
every
man
and
woman
in
the
village
in
order
that
they
may
have
power
to
dig
the
dead
man
s
grave
for
in
these
tribes
beasts
and
men
alike
that
have
been
struck
by
lightning
are
always
buried
and
the
flesh
is
never
eaten
next
a
sacrificial
beast
is
killed
and
a
fire
kindled
in
which
certain
magic
woods
or
roots
are
burned
to
charcoal
and
then
ground
to
powder
the
priest
thereupon
makes
incisions
in
various
parts
of
the
bodies
of
each
inmate
of
the
kraal
and
rubs
a
portion
of
the
powdered
charcoal
into
the
cuts
the
rest
of
the
powder
he
mixes
with
sour
milk
and
gives
to
them
all
to
drink
from
the
time
the
lightning
strikes
the
kraal
until
this
ceremony
has
been
performed
the
people
are
obliged
to
abstain
entirely
from
the
use
of
milk
their
heads
are
then
shaved
should
a
house
have
been
struck
by
lightning
it
must
be
abandoned
with
everything
in
it
until
all
these
rites
have
been
performed
none
of
the
people
may
leave
the
kraal
or
have
any
intercourse
whatever
with
others
but
when
the
ceremonies
have
been
duly
performed
the
people
are
pronounced
clean
and
may
again
associate
with
their
neighbours
however
for
some
months
afterwards
none
of
the
livestock
of
the
kraal
and
few
other
things
belonging
to
it
are
allowed
to
pass
into
other
hands
whether
by
way
of
sale
or
of
gift
hence
it
would
appear
that
all
persons
in
a
village
which
has
been
struck
by
lightning
are
supposed
to
be
infected
with
a
dangerous
virus
which
they
might
communicate
to
their
neighbours
and
the
vaccination
is
intended
to
disinfect
them
as
well
as
to
protect
them
against
the
recurrence
of
a
like
calamity
young
carib
warriors
used
to
be
inoculated
for
the
purpose
of
making
them
brave
and
hardy
some
time
before
the
ceremony
the
lad
who
was
to
be
operated
on
caught
a
bird
of
prey
of
a
particular
sort
and
kept
it
in
captivity
till
the
day
appointed
when
the
time
was
come
and
friends
had
assembled
to
witness
the
ceremony
the
father
of
the
boy
seized
the
bird
by
its
legs
and
crushed
its
head
by
beating
it
on
the
head
of
his
son
who
dared
not
wince
under
the
rain
of
blows
that
nearly
stunned
him
next
the
father
bruised
and
pounded
the
bird
s
flesh
and
steeped
it
in
water
together
with
a
certain
spice
after
which
he
scored
and
slashed
his
son
s
body
in
all
directions
washed
his
wounds
with
the
decoction
and
gave
him
the
bird
s
heart
to
eat
in
order
as
it
was
said
that
he
might
be
the
braver
for
it
it
is
not
always
deemed
necessary
either
that
the
mystical
substance
should
be
swallowed
by
the
communicant
or
that
he
should
receive
it
by
the
more
painful
process
of
scarification
and
inoculation
sometimes
it
is
thought
enough
merely
to
smear
or
anoint
him
with
it
among
some
of
the
australian
blacks
it
used
to
be
a
common
practice
to
kill
a
man
cut
out
his
and
rub
themselves
with
it
in
the
belief
that
all
the
qualities
both
physical
and
mental
which
had
distinguished
the
original
owner
of
the
fat
were
thus
communicated
by
its
means
to
the
person
who
greased
himself
with
it
the
kamilaroi
tribe
of
new
south
wales
sometimes
deposited
their
dead
on
the
forks
of
trees
and
lighting
fires
underneath
caught
the
fat
as
it
dropped
for
they
hoped
with
the
droppings
to
acquire
the
strength
and
courage
of
the
deceased
the
wollaroi
another
tribe
of
new
south
wales
used
to
place
the
dead
on
a
stage
and
the
mourners
sat
under
it
and
rubbed
their
bodies
with
the
juices
of
putrefaction
which
exuded
from
the
rotten
body
believing
that
this
made
them
strong
others
collected
these
juices
in
vessels
and
the
young
men
rubbed
the
stinking
liquid
into
their
persons
in
order
to
acquire
the
good
qualities
of
the
departed
wherever
a
like
custom
has
been
practised
as
it
has
been
for
example
by
some
of
the
natives
of
new
guinea
timor
laut
and
madagascar
we
may
conjecture
that
the
motive
has
been
similar
again
the
negroes
of
southern
guinea
regard
the
brain
as
the
seat
of
wisdom
and
think
it
a
pity
that
when
a
wise
man
dies
his
brain
and
his
wisdom
should
go
to
waste
together
so
they
sever
his
head
from
his
body
and
hang
it
up
over
a
mass
of
chalk
which
as
the
head
decays
receives
the
drippings
of
brain
and
wisdom
any
one
who
applies
the
precious
dripping
to
his
forehead
is
supposed
to
absorb
thereby
the
intelligence
of
the
dead
among
the
beku
a
tribe
of
dwarfs
attached
to
the
fans
in
west
africa
the
great
charm
for
success
in
hunting
is
procured
by
killing
a
man
and
afterwards
when
the
corpse
has
begun
to
moulder
in
the
grave
detaching
the
head
from
the
body
the
brain
heart
eyes
and
hairs
of
the
body
are
then
removed
and
mixed
according
to
a
secret
formula
with
special
incantations
when
the
compound
is
dry
the
hunter
rubs
himself
with
it
in
order
to
acquire
a
dash
of
the
higher
power
with
which
people
are
endowed
in
the
other
life
and
in
particular
their
among
the
digger
indians
of
california
when
a
man
died
it
was
customary
to
burn
the
body
to
ashes
mix
the
ashes
with
a
thick
resinous
gum
extracted
from
a
and
then
smear
the
gum
on
the
head
of
the
mourner
where
it
was
allowed
to
remain
till
it
gradually
wore
away
the
motive
for
the
custom
is
not
mentioned
but
it
was
probably
like
the
motive
for
the
parallel
custom
of
swallowing
the
ashes
of
the
dead
a
desire
to
participate
in
the
powers
and
virtues
of
the
departed
at
a
certain
stage
of
the
ceremonies
by
which
in
the
andaman
islands
a
boy
is
initiated
into
manhood
the
chief
takes
the
carcase
of
a
boar
and
presses
it
heavily
down
on
the
shoulders
back
and
limbs
of
the
young
man
as
he
sits
silent
and
motionless
on
the
ground
this
is
done
to
make
him
brave
and
strong
afterwards
the
animal
is
cut
up
and
its
melted
fat
is
poured
over
the
novice
and
rubbed
into
his
body
the
arabs
of
eastern
africa
believe
that
an
unguent
of
lion
s
fat
inspires
a
man
with
boldness
and
makes
the
wild
beasts
flee
in
terror
before
him
in
the
forests
of
brazil
there
lives
a
small
falcon
with
a
red
beak
which
is
so
that
it
can
detect
even
a
worm
on
the
ground
from
a
considerable
height
when
a
kobeua
indian
has
killed
one
of
these
birds
he
pokes
out
its
eyes
and
allows
the
fluid
to
drip
into
his
own
believing
that
in
this
way
they
will
be
like
those
of
the
falcon
most
of
the
baperis
or
malekootoos
a
bechuana
tribe
of
south
africa
revere
or
as
they
say
sing
the
porcupine
which
seems
to
be
their
totem
as
the
sun
is
the
totem
of
some
members
of
the
tribe
and
a
species
of
ape
the
totem
of
others
those
of
them
who
have
the
porcupine
for
their
totem
swear
by
the
animal
and
lament
if
any
one
injures
it
when
a
porcupine
has
been
killed
they
religiously
gather
up
its
bristles
spit
on
them
and
rub
their
eyebrows
with
them
saying
they
have
slain
our
brother
our
master
one
of
ourselves
him
whom
we
they
would
fear
to
die
if
they
ate
of
its
flesh
nevertheless
they
esteem
it
wholesome
for
an
infant
of
the
clan
to
rub
into
his
joints
certain
portions
of
the
paunch
of
the
animal
mixed
with
the
sap
of
some
plants
to
which
they
ascribe
an
occult
virtue
so
at
the
solemn
ceremony
which
is
observed
by
the
central
australian
tribes
for
the
purpose
of
multiplying
kangaroos
men
of
the
kangaroo
totem
not
only
eat
a
little
kangaroo
flesh
as
a
sacrament
but
also
have
their
bodies
anointed
with
kangaroo
fat
doubtless
the
intention
alike
of
the
eating
and
of
the
anointing
is
to
impart
to
the
man
the
qualities
of
his
totem
animal
and
thus
to
enable
him
to
perform
the
ceremonies
for
the
multiplication
of
the
breed
in
ancient
mexico
the
priests
of
the
god
tezcatlipoca
before
they
engaged
in
religious
rites
which
tried
the
nerve
used
to
smear
their
bodies
with
a
magic
ointment
which
had
the
effect
of
banishing
all
fear
so
that
they
would
confront
wild
beasts
in
their
dens
or
slaughter
people
in
sacrifice
with
the
utmost
indifference
the
ointment
which
had
this
marvellous
property
was
compounded
of
the
ashes
of
venomous
reptiles
and
insects
such
as
spiders
scorpions
centipedes
and
vipers
which
were
brayed
up
in
a
mortar
along
with
living
specimens
of
the
same
creatures
tobacco
soot
and
the
ashes
of
black
caterpillars
this
precious
substance
was
then
set
before
the
god
in
little
pots
because
they
said
it
was
his
victuals
therefore
they
called
it
a
divine
food
and
when
the
priests
had
besmeared
themselves
with
it
they
were
ready
to
discharge
the
duties
of
their
holy
office
by
butchering
their
fellow
men
in
the
human
shambles
without
one
qualm
of
fear
or
one
visiting
of
compassion
moreover
an
unction
of
this
ointment
was
deemed
a
sovereign
remedy
for
sickness
and
disease
hence
they
named
it
the
divine
physic
and
sick
people
came
from
all
quarters
to
the
priests
as
to
their
saviours
to
have
their
ailing
parts
anointed
with
the
divine
physic
and
to
be
made
whole
sometimes
the
valuable
qualities
of
an
animal
or
of
a
person
may
be
imparted
to
another
by
the
more
delicate
and
ethereal
process
of
fumigation
this
refined
mode
of
cultivating
the
moral
virtues
is
or
used
to
be
practised
by
the
caffres
of
south
africa
thus
in
former
times
as
soon
as
a
baby
was
born
some
dirt
was
scraped
from
the
forearm
and
other
parts
of
the
father
s
body
and
mixed
with
special
medicines
the
mixture
was
then
made
to
smoulder
and
the
baby
was
fumigated
or
washed
in
the
smoke
this
ceremony
was
deemed
of
great
importance
being
the
established
way
of
communicating
to
the
child
a
portion
of
the
ancestral
spirit
through
the
physical
medium
of
the
father
s
dirt
to
which
the
spirit
naturally
adheres
but
while
the
dirt
was
endowed
with
this
spiritual
potency
the
moral
character
of
the
infant
depended
in
a
large
measure
on
the
nature
of
the
medicines
with
which
the
dirt
was
compounded
and
accordingly
much
thought
and
skill
were
devoted
to
their
selection
and
preparation
foremost
among
the
ingredients
was
a
meteorite
burnt
to
a
cinder
and
ground
to
powder
the
effect
of
this
powder
well
mixed
with
the
dirt
and
introduced
into
the
orifices
of
the
child
s
body
by
means
of
smoke
is
to
close
the
anterior
fontanelle
of
the
baby
s
skull
to
strengthen
the
bones
of
that
important
part
of
his
person
to
communicate
vigour
to
his
mind
and
courage
to
his
disposition
and
in
general
to
brace
and
harden
his
whole
system
with
the
strength
and
hardness
of
the
meteorite
other
ingredients
which
have
a
most
beneficial
effect
are
the
powdered
whiskers
of
a
leopard
the
claws
of
a
lion
and
the
skin
of
a
salamander
the
mode
of
administering
the
medicine
is
as
follows
you
set
fire
to
the
compound
and
while
it
smoulders
you
hold
the
infant
wrapt
up
in
a
blanket
over
the
burning
mass
so
as
to
compel
it
to
inhale
the
smoke
to
make
sure
of
producing
the
desired
effect
some
of
the
powdered
medicine
is
mixed
with
the
baby
s
food
in
like
manner
by
holding
the
smouldering
feather
of
a
vulture
under
a
baby
s
nose
you
render
the
child
valiant
and
brave
like
a
vulture
and
if
you
do
the
same
with
a
peacock
s
feather
your
offspring
will
be
like
a
peacock
impavid
and
never
dismayed
by
thunder
or
other
terrible
noises
it
is
now
easy
to
understand
why
a
savage
should
desire
to
partake
of
the
flesh
of
an
animal
or
man
whom
he
regards
as
divine
by
eating
the
body
of
the
god
he
shares
in
the
god
s
attributes
and
powers
and
when
the
god
is
a
the
corn
is
his
proper
body
when
he
is
a
the
juice
of
the
grape
is
his
blood
and
so
by
eating
the
bread
and
drinking
the
wine
the
worshipper
partakes
of
the
real
body
and
blood
of
his
god
thus
the
drinking
of
wine
in
the
rites
of
a
like
dionysus
is
not
an
act
of
revelry
it
is
a
solemn
sacrament
yet
a
time
comes
when
reasonable
men
find
it
hard
to
understand
how
any
one
in
his
senses
can
suppose
that
by
eating
bread
or
drinking
wine
he
consumes
the
body
or
blood
of
a
deity
when
we
call
corn
ceres
and
wine
bacchus
says
cicero
we
use
a
common
figure
of
speech
but
do
you
imagine
that
anybody
is
so
insane
as
to
believe
that
the
thing
he
feeds
upon
is
a
god
in
writing
thus
the
roman
philosopher
little
foresaw
that
in
rome
itself
and
in
the
countries
which
have
derived
their
creed
from
her
the
belief
which
he
here
stigmatises
as
insane
was
destined
to
persist
for
thousands
of
years
as
a
cardinal
doctrine
of
religion
among
peoples
who
pride
themselves
on
their
religious
enlightenment
by
comparison
with
the
blind
superstitions
of
pagan
antiquity
so
little
can
even
the
greatest
minds
of
one
generation
foresee
the
devious
track
which
the
religious
faith
of

killing
the
divine
animal
killing
the
sacred
buzzard
in
the
preceding
chapters
we
saw
that
many
communities
which
have
progressed
so
far
as
to
subsist
mainly
by
agriculture
have
been
in
the
habit
of
killing
and
eating
their
farinaceous
deities
either
in
their
proper
form
of
corn
rice
and
so
forth
or
in
the
borrowed
shapes
of
animals
and
men
it
remains
to
shew
that
hunting
and
pastoral
tribes
as
well
as
agricultural
peoples
have
been
in
the
habit
of
killing
the
beings
whom
they
worship
among
the
worshipful
beings
or
gods
if
indeed
they
deserve
to
be
dignified
by
that
name
whom
hunters
and
shepherds
adore
and
kill
are
animals
pure
and
simple
not
animals
regarded
as
embodiments
of
other
supernatural
beings
our
first
example
is
drawn
from
the
indians
of
california
who
living
in
a
fertile
country
under
a
serene
and
temperate
sky
nevertheless
rank
near
the
bottom
of
the
savage
scale
where
a
stretch
of
coast
breaks
the
long
line
of
level
sands
that
receive
the
rollers
of
the
pacific
there
stood
in
former
days
not
far
from
the
brink
of
the
great
cliffs
the
white
of
san
juan
capistrano
among
the
monks
who
here
exercised
over
a
handful
of
wretched
indians
the
austere
discipline
of
catholic
spain
there
was
a
certain
father
geronimo
boscana
who
has
bequeathed
to
us
a
precious
record
of
the
customs
and
superstitions
of
his
savage
flock
thus
he
tells
us
that
the
acagchemem
tribe
adored
the
great
buzzard
and
that
once
a
year
they
celebrated
a
great
festival
called
or
in
its
honour
the
day
selected
for
the
festival
was
made
known
to
the
public
on
the
evening
before
its
celebration
and
preparations
were
at
once
made
for
the
erection
of
a
special
temple
which
seems
to
have
been
a
circular
or
oval
enclosure
of
stakes
with
the
stuffed
skin
of
a
coyote
or
set
up
on
a
hurdle
to
represent
the
god
chinigchinich
when
the
temple
was
ready
the
bird
was
carried
into
it
in
solemn
procession
and
laid
on
an
altar
erected
for
the
purpose
then
all
the
young
women
whether
married
or
single
began
to
run
to
and
fro
as
if
distracted
some
in
one
direction
and
some
in
another
while
the
elders
of
both
sexes
remained
silent
spectators
of
the
scene
and
the
captains
tricked
out
in
paint
and
feathers
danced
round
their
adored
bird
these
ceremonies
being
concluded
they
seized
upon
the
bird
and
carried
it
to
the
principal
temple
all
the
assembly
uniting
in
the
grand
display
and
the
captains
dancing
and
singing
at
the
head
of
the
procession
arrived
at
the
temple
they
killed
the
bird
without
losing
a
drop
of
its
blood
the
skin
was
removed
entire
and
preserved
with
the
feathers
as
a
relic
or
for
the
purpose
of
making
the
festal
garment
or
the
carcase
was
buried
in
a
hole
in
the
temple
and
the
old
women
gathered
round
the
grave
weeping
and
moaning
bitterly
while
they
threw
various
kinds
of
seeds
or
pieces
of
food
on
it
crying
out
why
did
you
run
away
would
you
not
have
been
better
with
us
you
would
have
made
a
kind
of
gruel
as
we
do
and
if
you
had
not
run
away
you
would
not
have
become
a
and
so
on
when
this
ceremony
was
concluded
the
dancing
was
resumed
and
kept
up
for
three
days
and
nights
they
said
that
the
was
a
woman
who
had
run
off
to
the
mountains
and
there
been
changed
into
a
bird
by
the
god
chinigchinich
they
believed
that
though
they
sacrificed
the
bird
annually
she
came
to
life
again
and
returned
to
her
home
in
the
mountains
moreover
they
thought
that
as
often
as
the
bird
was
killed
it
became
multiplied
because
every
year
all
the
different
capitanes
celebrated
the
same
feast
of
and
were
firm
in
the
opinion
that
the
birds
sacrificed
were
but
one
and
the
same
the
unity
in
multiplicity
thus
postulated
by
the
californians
is
very
noticeable
and
helps
to
explain
their
motive
for
killing
the
divine
bird
the
notion
of
the
life
of
a
species
as
distinct
from
that
of
an
individual
easy
and
obvious
as
it
seems
to
us
appears
to
be
one
which
the
californian
savage
can
not
grasp
he
is
unable
to
conceive
the
life
of
the
species
otherwise
than
as
an
individual
life
and
therefore
as
exposed
to
the
same
dangers
and
calamities
which
menace
and
finally
destroy
the
life
of
the
individual
apparently
he
imagines
that
a
species
left
to
itself
will
grow
old
and
die
like
an
individual
and
that
therefore
some
step
must
be
taken
to
save
from
extinction
the
particular
species
which
he
regards
as
divine
the
only
means
he
can
think
of
to
avert
the
catastrophe
is
to
kill
a
member
of
the
species
in
whose
veins
the
tide
of
life
is
still
running
strong
and
has
not
yet
stagnated
among
the
fens
of
old
age
the
life
thus
diverted
from
one
channel
will
flow
he
fancies
more
freshly
and
freely
in
a
new
one
in
other
words
the
slain
animal
will
revive
and
enter
on
a
new
term
of
life
with
all
the
spring
and
energy
of
youth
to
us
this
reasoning
is
transparently
absurd
but
so
too
is
the
custom
if
a
better
explanation
that
is
one
more
consonant
with
the
facts
and
with
the
principles
of
savage
thought
can
be
given
of
the
custom
i
will
willingly
withdraw
the
one
here
proposed
a
similar
confusion
it
may
be
noted
between
the
individual
life
and
the
life
of
the
species
was
made
by
the
samoans
each
family
had
for
its
god
a
particular
species
of
animal
yet
the
death
of
one
of
these
animals
for
example
an
owl
was
not
the
death
of
the
god
he
was
supposed
to
be
yet
alive
and
incarnate
in
all
the
owls
in
killing
the
sacred
ram
the
rude
californian
rite
which
we
have
just
considered
has
a
close
parallel
in
the
religion
of
ancient
egypt
the
thebans
and
all
other
egyptians
who
worshipped
the
theban
god
ammon
held
rams
to
be
sacred
and
would
not
sacrifice
them
but
once
a
year
at
the
festival
of
ammon
they
killed
a
ram
skinned
it
and
clothed
the
image
of
the
god
in
the
skin
then
they
mourned
over
the
ram
and
buried
it
in
a
sacred
tomb
the
custom
was
explained
by
a
story
that
zeus
had
once
exhibited
himself
to
hercules
clad
in
the
fleece
and
wearing
the
head
of
a
ram
of
course
the
ram
in
this
case
was
simply
the
of
thebes
as
the
wolf
was
the
of
lycopolis
and
the
goat
was
the
of
mendes
in
other
words
the
ram
was
ammon
himself
on
the
monuments
it
is
true
ammon
appears
in
form
with
the
body
of
a
man
and
the
head
of
a
ram
but
this
only
shews
that
he
was
in
the
usual
chrysalis
state
through
which
regularly
pass
before
they
emerge
as
anthropomorphic
gods
the
ram
therefore
was
killed
not
as
a
sacrifice
to
ammon
but
as
the
god
himself
whose
identity
with
the
beast
is
plainly
shewn
by
the
custom
of
clothing
his
image
in
the
skin
of
the
slain
ram
the
reason
for
thus
killing
the
annually
may
have
been
that
which
i
have
assigned
for
the
general
custom
of
killing
a
god
and
for
the
special
californian
custom
of
killing
the
divine
buzzard
as
applied
to
egypt
this
explanation
is
supported
by
the
analogy
of
the
apis
who
was
not
suffered
to
outlive
a
certain
term
of
years
the
intention
of
thus
putting
a
limit
to
the
life
of
the
human
god
was
as
i
have
argued
to
secure
him
from
the
weakness
and
frailty
of
age
the
same
reasoning
would
explain
the
an
older
putting
the
to
death
annually
as
was
done
with
the
ram
of
thebes
one
point
in
the
theban
application
of
the
skin
to
the
image
of
the
particular
attention
if
the
god
was
at
first
the
living
ram
his
representation
by
an
image
must
have
originated
later
but
how
did
it
originate
one
answer
to
this
question
is
perhaps
furnished
by
the
practice
of
preserving
the
skin
of
the
animal
which
is
slain
as
divine
the
californians
as
we
have
seen
preserved
the
skin
of
the
buzzard
and
the
skin
of
the
goat
which
is
killed
on
the
as
a
representative
of
the
is
kept
for
various
superstitious
purposes
the
skin
in
fact
was
kept
as
a
token
or
memorial
of
the
god
or
rather
as
containing
in
it
a
part
of
the
divine
life
and
it
had
only
to
be
stuffed
or
stretched
upon
a
frame
to
become
a
regular
image
of
him
at
first
an
image
of
this
kind
would
be
renewed
annually
the
new
image
being
provided
by
the
skin
of
the
slain
animal
but
from
annual
images
to
permanent
images
the
transition
is
easy
we
have
seen
that
the
older
custom
of
cutting
a
new
every
year
was
superseded
by
the
practice
of
maintaining
a
permanent
which
was
however
annually
decked
with
fresh
leaves
and
flowers
and
even
surmounted
each
year
by
a
fresh
young
tree
similarly
when
the
stuffed
skin
as
a
representative
of
the
god
was
replaced
by
a
permanent
image
of
him
in
wood
stone
or
metal
the
permanent
image
was
annually
clad
in
the
fresh
skin
of
the
slain
animal
when
this
stage
had
been
reached
the
custom
of
killing
the
ram
came
naturally
to
be
interpreted
as
a
sacrifice
offered
to
the
image
and
was
explained
by
a
story
like
that
of
ammon
and
hercules
killing
the
sacred
serpent
west
africa
appears
to
furnish
another
example
of
the
annual
killing
of
a
sacred
animal
and
the
preservation
of
its
skin
the
negroes
of
issapoo
in
the
island
of
fernando
po
regard
the
as
their
guardian
deity
who
can
do
them
good
or
ill
bestow
riches
or
inflict
disease
and
death
the
skin
of
one
of
these
reptiles
is
hung
tail
downwards
from
a
branch
of
the
highest
tree
in
the
public
square
and
the
placing
of
it
on
the
tree
is
an
annual
ceremony
as
soon
as
the
ceremony
is
over
all
children
born
within
the
past
year
are
carried
out
and
their
hands
made
to
touch
the
tail
of
the
serpent
s
skin
the
latter
custom
is
clearly
a
way
of
placing
the
infants
under
the
protection
of
the
tribal
god
similarly
in
senegambia
a
python
is
expected
to
visit
every
child
of
the
python
clan
within
eight
days
after
birth
and
the
psylli
a
snake
clan
of
ancient
africa
used
to
expose
their
infants
to
snakes
in
the
belief
that
the
snakes
would
not
harm
children
of
the
clan
killing
the
sacred
turtles
in
the
californian
egyptian
and
fernando
po
customs
the
animal
slain
may
perhaps
have
been
at
some
time
or
other
a
totem
but
this
is
very
doubtful
at
all
events
in
all
three
cases
the
worship
of
the
animal
seems
to
have
no
relation
to
agriculture
and
may
therefore
be
presumed
to
date
from
the
hunting
or
pastoral
stage
of
society
the
same
may
be
said
of
the
following
custom
though
the
people
who
practise
zuni
indians
of
new
now
settled
in
walled
villages
or
towns
of
a
peculiar
type
and
practise
agriculture
and
the
arts
of
pottery
and
weaving
but
the
zuni
custom
is
marked
by
certain
features
which
appear
to
place
it
in
a
somewhat
different
class
from
the
preceding
cases
it
may
be
well
therefore
to
describe
it
at
full
length
in
the
words
of
an
with
midsummer
the
heat
became
intense
my
brother
adopted
indian
brother
and
i
sat
day
after
day
in
the
cool
of
our
house
latter
busy
with
his
quaint
forge
and
crude
appliances
working
mexican
coins
over
into
bangles
girdles
buttons
and
what
not
for
savage
ornament
though
his
tools
were
wonderfully
rude
the
work
he
turned
out
by
dint
of
combined
patience
and
ingenuity
was
remarkably
beautiful
one
day
as
i
sat
watching
him
a
procession
of
fifty
men
went
hastily
down
the
hill
and
off
westward
over
the
plain
they
were
solemnly
led
by
a
painted
and
priest
and
followed
by
the
or
god
of
fire
after
they
had
vanished
i
asked
old
brother
what
it
all
meant
they
are
going
said
he
to
the
city
of
the
and
the
home
of
our
four
days
after
towards
sunset
costumed
and
masked
in
the
beautiful
paraphernalia
of
the
or
good
dance
they
returned
in
file
up
the
same
pathway
each
bearing
in
his
arms
a
basket
filled
with
living
squirming
turtles
which
he
regarded
and
carried
as
tenderly
as
a
mother
would
her
infant
some
of
the
wretched
reptiles
were
carefully
wrapped
in
soft
blankets
their
heads
and
protruding
mounted
on
the
backs
of
the
pilgrims
made
ludicrous
but
solemn
caricatures
of
little
children
in
the
same
position
while
i
was
at
supper
upstairs
that
evening
the
governor
s
came
in
he
was
welcomed
by
the
family
as
if
a
messenger
from
heaven
he
bore
in
his
tremulous
fingers
one
of
the
much
abused
and
rebellious
turtles
paint
still
adhered
to
his
hands
and
bare
feet
which
led
me
to
infer
that
he
had
formed
one
of
the
sacred
embassy
so
you
went
to
did
you
i
asked
e
e
replied
the
weary
man
in
a
voice
husky
with
long
chanting
as
he
sank
almost
exhausted
on
a
roll
of
skins
which
had
been
placed
for
him
and
tenderly
laid
the
turtle
on
the
floor
no
sooner
did
the
creature
find
itself
at
liberty
than
it
made
off
as
fast
as
its
lame
legs
would
take
it
of
one
accord
the
family
forsook
dish
spoon
and
and
grabbing
from
a
sacred
whole
handfuls
of
the
contents
hurriedly
followed
the
turtle
about
the
room
into
dark
corners
around
behind
the
and
out
into
the
middle
of
the
floor
again
praying
and
scattering
meal
on
its
back
as
they
went
at
last
strange
to
say
it
approached
the
man
who
had
brought
it
ha
he
exclaimed
with
emotion
see
it
comes
to
me
again
ah
what
great
favours
the
fathers
of
all
grant
me
this
day
and
passing
his
hand
gently
over
the
sprawling
animal
he
inhaled
from
his
palm
deeply
and
long
at
the
same
time
invoking
the
favour
of
the
gods
then
he
leaned
his
chin
upon
his
hand
and
with
large
wistful
eyes
regarded
his
ugly
captive
as
it
sprawled
about
blinking
its
eyes
and
clawing
the
smooth
floor
in
memory
of
its
native
element
at
this
juncture
i
ventured
a
question
why
do
you
not
let
him
go
or
give
him
some
water
slowly
the
man
turned
his
eyes
toward
me
an
odd
mixture
of
pain
indignation
and
pity
on
his
face
while
the
worshipful
family
stared
at
me
with
holy
horror
poor
younger
brother
he
said
at
last
know
you
not
how
precious
it
is
it
die
it
will
die
i
tell
you
it
can
not
but
it
will
die
if
you
don
t
feed
it
and
give
it
i
tell
you
it
die
it
will
only
change
houses
and
go
back
to
the
home
of
its
brothers
ah
well
how
should
know
he
mused
turning
to
the
blinded
turtle
again
ah
my
poor
dear
lost
child
or
parent
my
sister
or
brother
to
have
been
who
knows
which
maybe
my
own
or
mother
and
with
this
he
fell
to
weeping
most
pathetically
and
tremulous
with
sobs
which
were
echoed
by
the
women
and
children
he
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
filled
with
sympathy
for
his
grief
however
mistaken
i
raised
the
turtle
to
my
lips
and
kissed
its
cold
shell
then
depositing
it
on
the
floor
hastily
left
the
family
to
their
sorrows
next
day
with
prayers
and
tender
beseechings
plumes
and
offerings
the
poor
turtle
was
killed
and
its
flesh
and
bones
were
removed
and
deposited
in
the
little
river
that
it
might
return
once
more
to
eternal
life
among
its
comrades
in
the
dark
waters
of
the
lake
of
the
the
shell
carefully
scraped
and
dried
was
made
into
a
and
covered
by
a
piece
of
buckskin
it
still
hangs
from
the
rafters
of
my
brother
s
house
once
a
navajo
tried
to
buy
it
for
a
ladle
loaded
with
indignant
reproaches
he
was
turned
out
of
the
house
were
any
one
to
venture
the
suggestion
that
the
turtle
no
longer
lived
his
remark
would
cause
a
flood
of
tears
and
he
would
be
reminded
that
it
had
only
changed
houses
and
gone
to
live
for
ever
in
the
home
of
our
lost
in
this
custom
we
find
expressed
in
the
clearest
way
a
belief
in
the
transmigration
of
human
souls
into
the
bodies
of
turtles
the
theory
of
transmigration
is
held
by
the
moqui
indians
who
belong
to
the
same
race
as
the
zunis
the
moquis
are
divided
into
totem
bear
clan
deer
clan
wolf
clan
hare
clan
and
so
on
they
believe
that
the
ancestors
of
the
clans
were
bears
deer
wolves
hares
and
so
forth
and
that
at
death
the
members
of
each
clan
become
bears
deer
and
so
on
according
to
the
particular
clan
to
which
they
belonged
the
zuni
are
also
divided
into
clans
the
totems
of
which
agree
closely
with
those
of
the
moquis
and
one
of
their
totems
is
the
turtle
thus
their
belief
in
transmigration
into
the
turtle
is
probably
one
of
the
regular
articles
of
their
totem
faith
what
then
is
the
meaning
of
killing
a
turtle
in
which
the
soul
of
a
kinsman
is
believed
to
be
present
apparently
the
object
is
to
keep
up
a
communication
with
the
other
world
in
which
the
souls
of
the
departed
are
believed
to
be
assembled
in
the
form
of
turtles
it
is
a
common
belief
that
the
spirits
of
the
dead
return
occasionally
to
their
old
homes
and
accordingly
the
unseen
visitors
are
welcomed
and
feasted
by
the
living
and
then
sent
upon
their
way
in
the
zuni
ceremony
the
dead
are
fetched
home
in
the
form
of
turtles
and
the
killing
of
the
turtles
is
the
way
of
sending
back
the
souls
to
the
thus
the
general
explanation
given
above
of
the
custom
of
killing
a
god
seems
inapplicable
to
the
zuni
custom
the
true
meaning
of
which
is
somewhat
obscure
nor
is
the
obscurity
which
hangs
over
the
subject
entirely
dissipated
by
a
later
and
fuller
account
which
we
possess
of
the
ceremony
from
it
we
learn
that
the
ceremony
forms
part
of
the
elaborate
ritual
which
these
indians
observe
at
the
midsummer
solstice
for
the
purpose
of
ensuring
an
abundant
supply
of
rain
for
the
crops
envoys
are
despatched
to
bring
their
otherselves
the
tortoises
from
the
sacred
lake
kothluwalawa
to
which
the
souls
of
the
dead
are
believed
to
repair
when
the
creatures
have
thus
been
solemnly
brought
to
zuni
they
are
placed
in
a
bowl
of
water
and
dances
are
performed
beside
them
by
men
in
costume
who
personate
gods
and
goddesses
after
the
ceremonial
the
tortoises
are
taken
home
by
those
who
caught
them
and
are
hung
by
their
necks
to
the
rafters
till
morning
when
they
are
thrown
into
pots
of
boiling
water
the
eggs
are
considered
a
great
delicacy
the
meat
is
seldom
touched
except
as
a
medicine
which
is
curative
for
cutaneous
diseases
part
of
the
meat
is
deposited
in
the
river
with
white
shell
beads
and
turquoise
beads
as
offerings
to
council
of
the
this
account
at
all
events
confirms
the
inference
that
the
tortoises
are
supposed
to
be
reincarnations
of
the
human
dead
for
they
are
called
the
otherselves
of
the
zuni
indeed
what
else
should
they
be
than
the
souls
of
the
dead
in
the
bodies
of
tortoises
seeing
that
they
come
from
the
haunted
lake
as
the
principal
object
of
the
prayers
uttered
and
of
the
dances
performed
at
these
midsummer
ceremonies
appears
to
be
to
procure
rain
for
the
crops
it
may
be
that
the
intention
of
bringing
the
tortoises
to
zuni
and
dancing
before
them
is
to
intercede
with
the
ancestral
spirits
incarnate
in
the
animals
that
they
may
be
pleased
to
exert
their
power
over
the
waters
of
heaven
for
the
benefit
of
their
living
descendants
killing
the
sacred
bear
doubt
also
hangs
at
first
sight
over
the
meaning
of
the
offered
by
the
aino
or
ainu
a
primitive
people
who
are
found
in
the
japanese
island
of
yezo
or
yesso
as
well
as
in
saghalien
and
the
southern
of
the
kurile
islands
it
is
not
quite
easy
to
define
the
attitude
of
the
aino
towards
the
bear
on
the
one
hand
they
give
it
the
name
of
or
god
but
as
they
apply
the
same
word
to
strangers
it
may
mean
no
more
than
a
being
supposed
to
be
endowed
with
superhuman
or
at
all
events
extraordinary
powers
again
it
is
said
that
the
bear
is
their
chief
divinity
in
the
religion
of
the
aino
the
bear
plays
a
chief
part
amongst
the
animals
it
is
especially
the
bear
which
receives
an
idolatrous
veneration
they
worship
it
after
their
fashion
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
wild
beast
inspires
more
of
the
feeling
which
prompts
worship
than
the
inanimate
forces
of
nature
and
the
aino
may
be
distinguished
as
yet
on
the
other
hand
they
kill
the
bear
whenever
they
can
in
bygone
years
the
ainu
considered
the
most
manly
and
useful
way
in
which
a
person
could
possibly
spend
his
time
the
men
spend
the
autumn
winter
and
spring
in
hunting
deer
and
bears
part
of
their
tribute
or
taxes
is
paid
in
skins
and
they
subsist
on
the
dried
meat
bear
s
flesh
is
indeed
one
of
their
staple
foods
they
eat
it
both
fresh
and
salted
and
the
skins
of
bears
furnish
them
with
clothing
in
fact
the
worship
of
which
writers
on
this
subject
speak
appears
to
be
paid
chiefly
to
the
dead
animal
thus
although
they
kill
a
bear
whenever
they
can
in
the
process
of
dissecting
the
carcass
they
endeavour
to
conciliate
the
deity
whose
representative
they
have
slain
by
making
elaborate
obeisances
and
deprecatory
salutations
when
a
bear
has
been
killed
the
ainu
sit
down
and
admire
it
make
their
salaams
to
it
worship
it
and
offer
presents
of
when
a
bear
is
trapped
or
wounded
by
an
arrow
the
hunters
go
through
an
apologetic
or
propitiatory
the
skulls
of
slain
bears
receive
a
place
of
honour
in
their
huts
or
are
set
up
on
sacred
posts
outside
the
huts
and
are
treated
with
much
respect
libations
of
millet
beer
and
of
an
intoxicating
liquor
are
offered
to
them
and
they
are
addressed
as
divine
preservers
or
precious
the
skulls
of
foxes
are
also
fastened
to
the
sacred
posts
outside
the
huts
they
are
regarded
as
charms
against
evil
spirits
and
are
consulted
as
oracles
yet
it
is
expressly
said
the
live
fox
is
revered
just
as
little
as
the
bear
rather
they
avoid
it
as
much
as
possible
considering
it
a
wily
the
bear
can
hardly
therefore
be
described
as
a
sacred
animal
of
the
aino
nor
yet
as
a
totem
for
they
do
not
call
themselves
bears
and
they
kill
and
eat
the
animal
freely
however
they
have
a
legend
of
a
woman
who
had
a
son
by
a
bear
and
many
of
them
who
dwell
in
the
mountains
pride
themselves
on
being
descended
from
a
bear
such
people
are
called
descendants
of
the
bear
kamui
and
in
the
pride
of
their
heart
they
will
say
as
for
me
i
am
a
child
of
the
god
of
the
mountains
i
am
descended
from
the
divine
one
who
rules
in
the
mountains
meaning
by
the
god
of
the
mountains
no
other
than
the
bear
it
is
therefore
possible
that
as
our
principal
authority
the
rev
batchelor
believes
the
bear
may
have
been
the
totem
of
an
aino
clan
but
even
if
that
were
so
it
would
not
explain
the
respect
shewn
for
the
animal
by
the
whole
aino
people
but
it
is
the
of
the
aino
which
concerns
us
here
towards
the
end
of
winter
a
bear
cub
is
caught
and
brought
into
the
village
if
it
is
very
small
it
is
suckled
by
an
aino
woman
but
should
there
be
no
woman
able
to
suckle
it
the
little
animal
is
fed
from
the
hand
or
the
mouth
if
it
cries
loudly
and
long
for
its
mother
as
it
is
apt
to
do
its
owner
will
take
it
to
his
bosom
and
let
it
sleep
with
him
for
a
few
nights
thus
dispelling
its
fears
and
sense
of
loneliness
during
the
day
it
plays
about
in
the
hut
with
the
children
and
is
treated
with
great
affection
but
when
the
cub
grows
big
enough
to
pain
people
by
hugging
or
scratching
them
he
is
shut
up
in
a
strong
wooden
cage
where
he
stays
generally
for
two
or
three
years
fed
on
fish
and
millet
porridge
till
it
is
time
for
him
to
be
killed
and
eaten
but
it
is
a
peculiarly
striking
fact
that
the
young
bear
is
not
kept
merely
to
furnish
a
good
meal
rather
he
is
regarded
and
honoured
as
a
fetish
or
even
as
a
sort
of
higher
in
yezo
the
festival
is
generally
celebrated
in
september
or
october
before
it
takes
place
the
aino
apologise
to
their
gods
alleging
that
they
have
treated
the
bear
kindly
as
long
as
they
could
now
they
can
feed
him
no
longer
and
are
obliged
to
kill
him
a
man
who
gives
a
invites
his
relations
and
friends
in
a
small
village
nearly
the
whole
community
takes
part
in
the
feast
indeed
guests
from
distant
villages
are
invited
and
generally
come
allured
by
the
prospect
of
getting
drunk
for
nothing
the
form
of
invitation
runs
somewhat
as
follows
i
so
and
so
am
about
to
sacrifice
the
dear
little
divine
thing
who
resides
among
the
mountains
my
friends
and
masters
come
ye
to
the
feast
we
will
then
unite
in
the
great
pleasure
of
sending
the
god
away
when
all
the
people
are
assembled
in
front
of
the
cage
an
orator
chosen
for
the
purpose
addresses
the
bear
and
tells
it
that
they
are
about
to
send
it
forth
to
its
ancestors
he
craves
pardon
for
what
they
are
about
to
do
to
it
hopes
it
will
not
be
angry
and
comforts
it
by
assuring
the
animal
that
many
of
the
sacred
whittled
sticks
and
plenty
of
cakes
and
wine
will
be
sent
with
it
on
the
long
journey
one
speech
of
this
sort
which
batchelor
heard
ran
as
follows
o
thou
divine
one
thou
wast
sent
into
the
world
for
us
to
hunt
o
thou
precious
little
divinity
we
worship
thee
pray
hear
our
prayer
we
have
nourished
thee
and
brought
thee
up
with
a
deal
of
pains
and
trouble
all
because
we
love
thee
so
now
as
thou
hast
grown
big
we
are
about
to
send
thee
to
thy
father
and
mother
when
thou
comest
to
them
please
speak
well
of
us
and
tell
them
how
kind
we
have
been
please
come
to
us
again
and
we
will
sacrifice
having
been
secured
with
ropes
the
bear
is
then
let
out
of
the
cage
and
assailed
with
a
shower
of
blunt
arrows
in
order
to
rouse
it
to
fury
when
it
has
spent
itself
in
vain
struggles
it
is
tied
up
to
a
stake
gagged
and
strangled
its
neck
being
placed
between
two
poles
which
are
then
violently
compressed
all
the
people
eagerly
helping
to
squeeze
the
animal
to
death
an
arrow
is
also
discharged
into
the
beast
s
heart
by
a
good
marksman
but
so
as
not
to
shed
blood
for
they
think
that
it
would
be
very
unlucky
if
any
of
the
blood
were
to
drip
on
the
ground
however
the
men
sometimes
drink
the
warm
blood
of
the
bear
that
the
courage
and
other
virtues
it
possesses
may
pass
into
them
and
sometimes
they
besmear
themselves
and
their
clothes
with
the
blood
in
order
to
ensure
success
in
hunting
when
the
animal
has
been
strangled
to
death
it
is
skinned
and
its
head
is
cut
off
and
set
in
the
east
window
of
the
house
where
a
piece
of
its
own
flesh
is
placed
under
its
snout
together
with
a
cup
of
its
own
meat
boiled
some
millet
dumplings
and
dried
fish
prayers
are
then
addressed
to
the
dead
animal
amongst
other
things
it
is
sometimes
invited
after
going
away
to
its
father
and
mother
to
return
into
the
world
in
order
that
it
may
again
be
reared
for
sacrifice
when
the
bear
is
supposed
to
have
finished
eating
its
own
flesh
the
man
who
presides
at
the
feast
takes
the
cup
containing
the
boiled
meat
salutes
it
and
divides
the
contents
between
all
the
company
present
every
person
young
and
old
alike
must
taste
a
little
the
cup
is
called
the
cup
of
offering
because
it
has
just
been
offered
to
the
dead
bear
when
the
rest
of
the
flesh
has
been
cooked
it
is
shared
out
in
like
manner
among
all
the
people
everybody
partaking
of
at
least
a
morsel
not
to
partake
of
the
feast
would
be
equivalent
to
excommunication
it
would
be
to
place
the
recreant
outside
the
pale
of
aino
fellowship
formerly
every
particle
of
the
bear
except
the
bones
had
to
be
eaten
up
at
the
banquet
but
this
rule
is
now
relaxed
the
head
on
being
detached
from
the
skin
is
set
up
on
a
long
pole
beside
the
sacred
wands
outside
of
the
house
where
it
remains
till
nothing
but
the
bare
white
skull
is
left
skulls
so
set
up
are
worshipped
not
only
at
the
time
of
the
festival
but
very
often
as
long
as
they
last
the
aino
assured
batchelor
that
they
really
do
believe
the
spirits
of
the
worshipful
animals
to
reside
in
the
skulls
that
is
why
they
address
them
as
divine
preservers
and
precious
the
ceremony
of
killing
the
bear
was
witnessed
by
scheube
on
the
tenth
of
august
at
kunnui
which
is
a
village
on
volcano
bay
in
the
island
of
yezo
or
yesso
as
his
description
of
the
rite
contains
some
interesting
particulars
not
mentioned
in
the
foregoing
account
it
may
be
worth
while
to
summarise
it
on
entering
the
hut
he
found
about
thirty
aino
present
men
women
and
children
all
dressed
in
their
best
the
master
of
the
house
first
offered
a
libation
on
the
fireplace
to
the
god
of
the
fire
and
the
guests
followed
his
example
then
a
libation
was
offered
to
the
in
his
sacred
corner
of
the
hut
meanwhile
the
housewife
who
had
nursed
the
bear
sat
by
herself
silent
and
sad
bursting
now
and
then
into
tears
her
grief
was
obviously
unaffected
and
it
deepened
as
the
festival
went
on
next
the
master
of
the
house
and
some
of
the
guests
went
out
of
the
hut
and
offered
libations
before
the
bear
s
cage
a
few
drops
were
presented
to
the
bear
in
a
saucer
which
he
at
once
upset
then
the
women
and
girls
danced
round
the
cage
their
faces
turned
towards
it
their
knees
slightly
bent
rising
and
hopping
on
their
toes
as
they
danced
they
clapped
their
hands
and
sang
a
monotonous
song
the
housewife
and
a
few
old
women
who
might
have
nursed
many
bears
danced
tearfully
stretching
out
their
arms
to
the
bear
and
addressing
it
in
terms
of
endearment
the
young
folks
were
less
affected
they
laughed
as
well
as
sang
disturbed
by
the
noise
the
bear
began
to
rush
about
his
cage
and
howl
lamentably
next
libations
were
offered
at
the
inabos
or
sacred
wands
which
stand
outside
of
an
aino
hut
these
wands
are
about
a
couple
of
feet
high
and
are
whittled
at
the
top
into
spiral
shavings
five
new
wands
with
bamboo
leaves
attached
to
them
had
been
set
up
for
the
festival
this
is
regularly
done
when
a
bear
is
killed
the
leaves
mean
that
the
animal
may
come
to
life
again
then
the
bear
was
let
out
of
his
cage
a
rope
was
thrown
round
his
neck
and
he
was
led
about
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
hut
while
this
was
being
done
the
men
headed
by
a
chief
shot
at
the
beast
with
arrows
tipped
with
wooden
buttons
scheube
had
to
do
so
also
then
the
bear
was
taken
before
the
sacred
wands
a
stick
was
put
in
his
mouth
nine
men
knelt
on
him
and
pressed
his
neck
against
a
beam
in
five
minutes
the
animal
had
expired
without
uttering
a
sound
meantime
the
women
and
girls
had
taken
post
behind
the
men
where
they
danced
lamenting
and
beating
the
men
who
were
killing
the
bear
the
bear
s
carcase
was
next
placed
on
the
mat
before
the
sacred
wands
and
a
sword
and
quiver
taken
from
the
wands
were
hung
round
the
beast
s
neck
being
a
it
was
also
adorned
with
a
necklace
and
then
food
and
drink
were
offered
to
it
in
the
shape
of
and
a
pot
of
the
men
now
sat
down
on
mats
before
the
dead
bear
offered
libations
to
it
and
drank
deep
meanwhile
the
women
and
girls
had
laid
aside
all
marks
of
sorrow
and
danced
merrily
none
more
merrily
than
the
old
women
when
the
mirth
was
at
its
height
two
young
aino
who
had
let
the
bear
out
of
his
cage
mounted
the
roof
of
the
hut
and
threw
cakes
of
millet
among
the
company
who
all
scrambled
for
them
without
distinction
of
age
or
sex
the
bear
was
next
skinned
and
disembowelled
and
the
trunk
severed
from
the
head
to
which
the
skin
was
left
hanging
the
blood
caught
in
cups
was
eagerly
swallowed
by
the
men
none
of
the
women
or
children
appeared
to
drink
the
blood
though
custom
did
not
forbid
them
to
do
so
the
liver
was
cut
in
small
pieces
and
eaten
raw
with
salt
the
women
and
children
getting
their
share
the
flesh
and
the
rest
of
the
vitals
were
taken
into
the
house
to
be
kept
till
the
next
day
but
one
and
then
to
be
divided
among
the
persons
who
had
been
present
at
the
feast
blood
and
liver
were
offered
to
scheube
while
the
bear
was
being
disembowelled
the
women
and
girls
danced
the
same
dance
which
they
had
danced
at
the
however
round
the
cage
but
in
front
of
the
sacred
wands
at
this
dance
the
old
women
who
had
been
merry
a
moment
before
again
shed
tears
freely
after
the
brain
had
been
extracted
from
the
bear
s
head
and
swallowed
with
salt
the
skull
detached
from
the
skin
was
hung
on
a
pole
beside
the
sacred
wands
the
stick
with
which
the
bear
had
been
gagged
was
also
fastened
to
the
pole
and
so
were
the
sword
and
quiver
which
had
been
hung
on
the
carcase
the
latter
were
removed
in
about
an
hour
but
the
rest
remained
standing
the
whole
company
men
and
women
danced
noisily
before
the
pole
and
another
in
which
the
women
joined
closed
the
festival
perhaps
the
first
published
account
of
the
of
the
aino
is
one
which
was
given
to
the
world
by
a
japanese
writer
in
it
has
been
translated
into
french
and
runs
thus
when
they
find
a
young
bear
they
bring
it
home
and
the
wife
suckles
it
when
it
is
grown
they
feed
it
with
fish
and
fowl
and
kill
it
in
winter
for
the
sake
of
the
liver
which
they
esteem
an
antidote
to
poison
the
worms
colic
and
disorders
of
the
stomach
it
is
of
a
very
bitter
taste
and
is
good
for
nothing
if
the
bear
has
been
killed
in
summer
this
butchery
begins
in
the
first
japanese
month
for
this
purpose
they
put
the
animal
s
head
between
two
long
poles
which
are
squeezed
together
by
fifty
or
sixty
people
both
men
and
women
when
the
bear
is
dead
they
eat
his
flesh
keep
the
liver
as
a
medicine
and
sell
the
skin
which
is
black
and
commonly
six
feet
long
but
the
longest
measure
twelve
feet
as
soon
as
he
is
skinned
the
persons
who
nourished
the
beast
begin
to
bewail
him
afterwards
they
make
little
cakes
to
regale
those
who
helped
the
aino
of
saghalien
rear
bear
cubs
and
kill
them
with
similar
ceremonies
we
are
told
that
they
do
not
look
upon
the
bear
as
a
god
but
only
as
a
messenger
whom
they
despatch
with
various
commissions
to
the
god
of
the
forest
the
animal
is
kept
for
about
two
years
in
a
cage
and
then
killed
at
a
festival
which
always
takes
place
in
winter
and
at
night
the
day
before
the
sacrifice
is
devoted
to
lamentation
old
women
relieving
each
other
in
the
duty
of
weeping
and
groaning
in
front
of
the
bear
s
cage
then
about
the
middle
of
the
night
or
very
early
in
the
morning
an
orator
makes
a
long
speech
to
the
beast
reminding
him
how
they
have
taken
care
of
him
and
fed
him
well
and
bathed
him
in
the
river
and
made
him
warm
and
comfortable
now
he
proceeds
we
are
holding
a
great
festival
in
your
honour
be
not
afraid
we
will
not
hurt
you
we
will
only
kill
you
and
send
you
to
the
god
of
the
forest
who
loves
you
we
are
about
to
offer
you
a
good
dinner
the
best
you
have
ever
eaten
among
us
and
we
will
all
weep
for
you
together
the
aino
who
will
kill
you
is
the
best
shot
among
us
there
he
is
he
weeps
and
asks
your
forgiveness
you
will
feel
almost
nothing
it
will
be
done
so
quickly
we
can
not
feed
you
always
as
you
will
understand
we
have
done
enough
for
you
it
is
now
your
turn
to
sacrifice
yourself
for
us
you
will
ask
god
to
send
us
for
the
winter
plenty
of
otters
and
sables
and
for
the
summer
seals
and
fish
in
abundance
do
not
forget
our
messages
we
love
you
much
and
our
children
will
never
forget
when
the
bear
has
partaken
of
his
last
meal
amid
the
general
emotion
of
the
spectators
the
old
women
weeping
afresh
and
the
men
uttering
stifled
cries
he
is
strapped
not
without
difficulty
and
danger
and
being
let
out
of
the
cage
is
led
on
leash
or
dragged
according
to
the
state
of
his
temper
thrice
round
his
cage
then
round
his
master
s
house
and
lastly
round
the
house
of
the
orator
thereupon
he
is
tied
up
to
a
tree
which
is
decked
with
sacred
whittled
sticks
of
the
usual
sort
and
the
orator
again
addresses
him
in
a
long
harangue
which
sometimes
lasts
till
the
day
is
beginning
to
break
remember
he
cries
remember
i
remind
you
of
your
whole
life
and
of
the
services
we
have
rendered
you
it
is
now
for
you
to
do
your
duty
do
not
forget
what
i
have
asked
of
you
you
will
tell
the
gods
to
give
us
riches
that
our
hunters
may
return
from
the
forest
laden
with
rare
furs
and
animals
good
to
eat
that
our
fishers
may
find
troops
of
seals
on
the
shore
and
in
the
sea
and
that
their
nets
may
crack
under
the
weight
of
the
fish
we
have
no
hope
but
in
you
the
evil
spirits
laugh
at
us
and
too
often
they
are
unfavourable
and
malignant
to
us
but
they
will
bow
before
you
we
have
given
you
food
and
joy
and
health
now
we
kill
you
in
order
that
you
may
in
return
send
riches
to
us
and
to
our
to
this
discourse
the
bear
more
and
more
surly
and
agitated
listens
without
conviction
round
and
round
the
tree
he
paces
and
howls
lamentably
till
just
as
the
first
beams
of
the
rising
sun
light
up
the
scene
an
archer
speeds
an
arrow
to
his
heart
no
sooner
has
he
done
so
than
the
marksman
throws
away
his
bow
and
flings
himself
on
the
ground
and
the
old
men
and
women
do
the
same
weeping
and
sobbing
then
they
offer
the
dead
beast
a
repast
of
rice
and
wild
potatoes
and
having
spoken
to
him
in
terms
of
pity
and
thanked
him
for
what
he
has
done
and
suffered
they
cut
off
his
head
and
paws
and
keep
them
as
sacred
things
a
banquet
on
the
flesh
and
blood
of
the
bear
follows
women
were
formerly
excluded
from
it
but
now
they
share
with
the
men
the
blood
is
drunk
warm
by
all
present
the
flesh
is
boiled
custom
forbids
it
to
be
roasted
and
as
the
relics
of
the
bear
may
not
enter
the
house
by
the
door
and
aino
houses
in
saghalien
have
no
windows
a
man
gets
up
on
the
roof
and
lets
the
flesh
the
head
and
the
skin
down
through
the
rice
and
wild
potatoes
are
then
offered
to
the
head
and
a
pipe
tobacco
and
matches
are
considerately
placed
beside
it
custom
requires
that
the
guests
should
eat
up
the
whole
animal
before
they
depart
the
use
of
salt
and
pepper
at
the
meal
is
forbidden
and
no
morsel
of
the
flesh
may
be
given
to
the
dogs
when
the
banquet
is
over
the
head
is
carried
away
into
the
depth
of
the
forest
and
deposited
on
a
heap
of
bears
skulls
the
bleached
and
mouldering
relics
of
similar
festivals
in
the
past
the
gilyaks
a
tunguzian
people
of
eastern
siberia
hold
a
of
the
same
sort
once
a
year
in
january
the
bear
is
the
object
of
the
most
refined
solicitude
of
an
entire
village
and
plays
the
chief
part
in
their
religious
an
old
is
shot
and
her
cub
is
reared
but
not
suckled
in
the
village
when
the
bear
is
big
enough
he
is
taken
from
his
cage
and
dragged
through
the
village
but
first
they
lead
him
to
the
bank
of
the
river
for
this
is
believed
to
ensure
abundance
of
fish
to
each
family
he
is
then
taken
into
every
house
in
the
village
where
fish
brandy
and
so
forth
are
offered
to
him
some
people
prostrate
themselves
before
the
beast
his
entrance
into
a
house
is
supposed
to
bring
a
blessing
and
if
he
snuffs
at
the
food
offered
to
him
this
also
is
a
blessing
nevertheless
they
tease
and
worry
poke
and
tickle
the
animal
continually
so
that
he
is
surly
and
snappish
after
being
thus
taken
to
every
house
he
is
tied
to
a
peg
and
shot
dead
with
arrows
his
head
is
then
cut
off
decked
with
shavings
and
placed
on
the
table
where
the
feast
is
set
out
here
they
beg
pardon
of
the
beast
and
worship
him
then
his
flesh
is
roasted
and
eaten
in
special
vessels
of
wood
finely
carved
they
do
not
eat
the
flesh
raw
nor
drink
the
blood
as
the
aino
do
the
brain
and
entrails
are
eaten
last
and
the
skull
still
decked
with
shavings
is
placed
on
a
tree
near
the
house
then
the
people
sing
and
both
sexes
dance
in
ranks
as
bears
one
of
these
was
witnessed
by
the
russian
traveller
von
schrenck
and
his
companions
at
the
gilyak
village
of
tebach
in
january
from
his
detailed
report
of
the
ceremony
we
may
gather
some
particulars
which
are
not
noticed
in
the
briefer
accounts
which
i
have
just
summarised
the
bear
he
tells
us
plays
a
great
part
in
the
life
of
all
the
peoples
inhabiting
the
region
of
the
amoor
and
siberia
as
far
as
kamtchatka
but
among
none
of
them
is
his
importance
greater
than
among
the
gilyaks
the
immense
size
which
the
animal
attains
in
the
valley
of
the
amoor
his
ferocity
whetted
by
hunger
and
the
frequency
of
his
appearance
all
combine
to
make
him
the
most
dreaded
beast
of
prey
in
the
country
no
wonder
therefore
that
the
fancy
of
the
gilyaks
is
busied
with
him
and
surrounds
him
both
in
life
and
in
death
with
a
sort
of
halo
of
superstitious
fear
thus
for
example
it
is
thought
that
if
a
gilyak
falls
in
combat
with
a
bear
his
soul
transmigrates
into
the
body
of
the
beast
nevertheless
his
flesh
has
an
irresistible
attraction
for
the
gilyak
palate
especially
when
the
animal
has
been
kept
in
captivity
for
some
time
and
fattened
on
fish
which
gives
the
flesh
in
the
opinion
of
the
gilyaks
a
peculiarly
delicious
flavour
but
in
order
to
enjoy
this
dainty
with
impunity
they
deem
it
needful
to
perform
a
long
series
of
ceremonies
of
which
the
intention
is
to
delude
the
living
bear
by
a
show
of
respect
and
to
appease
the
anger
of
the
dead
animal
by
the
homage
paid
to
his
departed
spirit
the
marks
of
respect
begin
as
soon
as
the
beast
is
captured
he
is
brought
home
in
triumph
and
kept
in
a
cage
where
all
the
villagers
take
it
in
turns
to
feed
him
for
although
he
may
have
been
captured
or
purchased
by
one
man
he
belongs
in
a
manner
to
the
whole
village
his
flesh
will
furnish
a
common
feast
and
hence
all
must
contribute
to
support
him
in
his
life
his
diet
consists
exclusively
of
raw
or
dried
fish
water
and
a
sort
of
porridge
compounded
of
powdered
and
the
length
of
time
he
is
kept
in
captivity
depends
on
his
age
old
bears
are
kept
only
a
few
months
cubs
are
kept
till
they
are
a
thick
layer
of
fat
on
the
captive
bear
gives
the
signal
for
the
festival
which
is
always
held
in
winter
generally
in
december
but
sometimes
in
january
or
february
at
the
festival
witnessed
by
the
russian
travellers
which
lasted
a
good
many
days
three
bears
were
killed
and
eaten
more
than
once
the
animals
were
led
about
in
procession
and
compelled
to
enter
every
house
in
the
village
where
they
were
fed
as
a
mark
of
honour
and
to
shew
that
they
were
welcome
guests
but
before
the
beasts
set
out
on
this
round
of
visits
the
gilyaks
played
at
in
presence
and
perhaps
as
von
schrenck
inclined
to
believe
in
honour
of
the
animals
the
night
before
they
were
killed
the
three
bears
were
led
by
moonlight
a
long
way
on
the
ice
of
the
frozen
river
that
night
no
one
in
the
village
might
sleep
next
day
after
the
animals
had
been
again
led
down
the
steep
bank
to
the
river
and
conducted
thrice
round
the
hole
in
the
ice
from
which
the
women
of
the
village
drew
their
water
they
were
taken
to
an
appointed
place
not
far
from
the
village
and
shot
to
death
with
arrows
the
place
of
sacrifice
or
execution
was
marked
as
holy
by
being
surrounded
with
whittled
sticks
from
the
tops
of
which
shavings
hung
in
curls
such
sticks
are
with
the
gilyaks
as
with
the
aino
the
regular
symbols
that
accompany
all
religious
ceremonies
before
the
bears
received
the
fatal
shafts
from
two
young
men
chosen
for
the
purpose
the
boys
were
allowed
to
discharge
their
small
but
not
always
harmless
arrows
at
the
beasts
as
soon
as
the
carcases
had
been
cut
up
the
skins
with
the
heads
attached
to
them
were
set
up
in
a
wooden
cage
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
it
appear
that
the
animals
had
entered
the
cage
and
were
looking
out
of
it
the
blood
which
flowed
from
the
bears
on
the
spot
where
they
were
killed
was
immediately
covered
up
with
snow
to
prevent
any
one
from
accidentally
treading
on
it
a
thing
which
was
strictly
tabooed
when
the
house
has
been
arranged
and
decorated
for
their
reception
the
skins
of
the
bears
with
their
heads
attached
to
them
are
brought
into
it
not
however
by
the
door
but
through
a
window
and
then
hung
on
a
sort
of
scaffold
opposite
the
hearth
on
which
the
flesh
is
to
be
cooked
this
ceremony
of
bringing
the
bears
skins
into
the
house
by
the
window
was
not
witnessed
by
the
russian
travellers
who
only
learned
of
it
at
second
hand
they
were
told
that
when
the
thin
disc
of
which
is
the
substitute
for
a
pane
of
glass
in
the
window
has
been
replaced
after
the
passage
of
the
a
figure
of
a
toad
made
of
birch
bark
is
affixed
to
it
on
the
outside
while
inside
the
house
a
figure
of
a
bear
dressed
in
gilyak
costume
is
set
on
the
bench
of
honour
the
meaning
of
this
part
of
the
ceremony
as
it
is
conjecturally
interpreted
by
von
schrenck
may
be
as
follows
the
toad
is
a
creature
that
has
a
very
evil
reputation
with
the
gilyaks
and
accordingly
they
attempt
to
lay
upon
it
as
on
a
scapegoat
the
guilt
of
the
slaughter
of
the
worshipful
bear
hence
its
effigy
is
excluded
from
the
house
and
has
to
remain
outside
at
the
window
a
witness
of
its
own
misdeeds
whereas
the
bear
is
brought
into
the
house
and
treated
as
an
honoured
guest
for
fish
and
flesh
are
laid
before
it
and
its
effigy
dressed
in
gilyak
costume
is
seated
on
the
bench
of
honour
the
boiling
of
the
bears
flesh
among
the
gilyaks
is
done
only
by
the
oldest
men
whose
high
privilege
it
is
women
and
children
young
men
and
boys
have
no
part
in
it
the
task
is
performed
slowly
and
deliberately
with
a
certain
solemnity
on
the
occasion
described
by
the
russian
travellers
the
kettle
was
first
of
all
surrounded
with
a
thick
wreath
of
shavings
and
then
filled
with
snow
for
the
use
of
water
to
cook
bear
s
flesh
is
forbidden
meanwhile
a
large
wooden
trough
richly
adorned
with
arabesques
and
carvings
of
all
sorts
was
hung
immediately
under
the
snouts
of
the
bears
on
one
side
of
the
trough
was
carved
in
relief
a
bear
on
the
other
side
a
toad
when
the
carcases
were
being
cut
up
each
leg
was
laid
on
the
ground
in
front
of
the
bears
as
if
to
ask
their
leave
before
being
placed
in
the
kettle
and
the
boiled
flesh
was
fished
out
of
the
kettle
with
an
iron
hook
and
set
in
the
trough
before
the
bears
in
order
that
they
might
be
the
first
to
taste
of
their
own
flesh
as
fast
too
as
the
fat
was
cut
in
strips
it
was
hung
up
in
front
of
the
bears
and
afterwards
laid
in
a
small
wooden
trough
on
the
ground
before
them
last
of
all
the
inner
organs
of
the
beasts
were
cut
up
and
placed
in
small
vessels
at
the
same
time
the
women
made
bandages
out
of
rags
and
after
sunset
these
bandages
were
tied
round
the
bears
snouts
just
below
the
eyes
in
order
to
dry
the
tears
that
flowed
from
to
each
bandage
just
below
the
eyes
was
attached
a
figure
of
a
toad
cut
out
of
birch
bark
the
meaning
of
this
appears
to
be
as
von
schrenck
conjectured
as
follows
with
the
carving
of
his
inner
organs
the
heart
liver
and
so
forth
the
bear
sees
that
his
fate
is
sealed
and
sheds
some
natural
tears
at
his
hard
lot
these
tears
trickle
down
his
snout
over
the
figure
of
the
toad
which
the
poor
deluded
bear
accordingly
regards
as
the
author
of
all
the
mischief
for
he
can
not
blame
the
gilyaks
who
have
treated
him
so
kindly
have
they
not
received
him
as
a
guest
in
their
house
set
him
on
the
seat
of
honour
given
him
of
their
best
and
done
nothing
but
with
his
knowledge
and
permission
finally
have
not
their
women
shewn
him
the
last
delicate
mark
of
attention
by
drying
the
tears
that
flow
from
his
eyes
and
trickle
down
his
nose
surely
then
he
can
not
think
that
these
kindly
folk
have
done
him
any
harm
it
was
all
the
fault
of
the
unprincipled
toad
whatever
may
be
thought
of
this
explanation
as
soon
as
the
ceremony
of
wiping
away
poor
bruin
s
tears
had
been
performed
the
assembled
gilyaks
set
to
work
in
earnest
to
devour
his
flesh
the
broth
obtained
by
boiling
the
meat
had
already
been
partaken
of
the
wooden
bowls
platters
and
spoons
out
of
which
the
gilyaks
eat
the
broth
and
flesh
of
the
bears
on
these
occasions
are
always
made
specially
for
the
purpose
at
the
festival
and
only
then
they
are
elaborately
ornamented
with
carved
figures
of
bears
and
other
devices
that
refer
to
the
animal
or
the
festival
and
the
people
have
a
strong
superstitious
scruple
against
parting
with
them
while
the
festival
lasts
no
salt
may
be
used
in
cooking
the
bear
s
flesh
or
indeed
any
other
food
and
no
flesh
of
any
kind
may
be
roasted
for
the
bear
would
hear
the
hissing
and
sputtering
of
the
roasting
flesh
and
would
be
very
angry
after
the
bones
had
been
picked
clean
they
were
put
back
in
the
kettle
in
which
the
flesh
had
been
boiled
and
when
the
festal
meal
was
over
an
old
man
took
his
stand
at
the
door
of
the
house
with
a
branch
of
fir
in
his
hand
with
which
as
the
people
passed
out
he
gave
a
light
blow
to
every
one
who
had
eaten
of
the
bear
s
flesh
or
fat
perhaps
as
a
punishment
for
their
treatment
of
the
worshipful
animal
in
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
the
women
performed
a
strange
dance
only
one
woman
danced
at
a
time
throwing
the
upper
part
of
her
body
into
the
oddest
postures
while
she
held
in
her
hands
a
branch
of
fir
or
a
kind
of
wooden
castanets
the
other
women
meanwhile
played
an
accompaniment
in
a
peculiar
rhythm
by
drumming
on
the
beams
of
the
house
with
clubs
the
dance
reminded
one
of
the
russian
travellers
of
the
which
he
had
seen
danced
by
the
women
of
kamtchatka
von
schrenck
believes
though
he
has
not
positive
evidence
that
after
the
fat
and
flesh
of
the
bear
have
been
consumed
his
skull
is
cleft
with
an
axe
and
the
brain
taken
out
and
eaten
then
the
bones
and
the
skull
are
solemnly
carried
out
by
the
oldest
people
to
a
place
in
the
forest
not
far
from
the
village
there
all
the
bones
except
the
skull
are
buried
after
that
a
young
tree
is
felled
a
few
inches
above
the
ground
its
stump
cleft
and
the
skull
wedged
into
the
cleft
when
the
grass
grows
over
the
spot
the
skull
disappears
from
view
and
that
is
the
end
of
the
bear
another
description
of
the
of
the
gilyaks
has
been
given
us
by
leo
sternberg
it
agrees
substantially
with
the
foregoing
accounts
but
a
few
particulars
in
it
may
be
noted
according
to
sternberg
the
festival
is
usually
held
in
honour
of
a
deceased
relation
the
next
of
kin
either
buys
or
catches
a
bear
cub
and
nurtures
it
for
two
or
three
years
till
it
is
ready
for
the
sacrifice
only
certain
distinguished
guests
are
privileged
to
partake
of
the
bear
s
flesh
but
the
host
and
members
of
his
clan
eat
a
broth
made
from
the
flesh
great
quantities
of
this
broth
are
prepared
and
consumed
on
the
occasion
the
guests
of
honour
must
belong
to
the
clan
into
which
the
host
s
daughters
and
the
other
women
of
his
clan
are
married
one
of
these
guests
usually
the
host
s
is
entrusted
with
the
duty
of
shooting
the
bear
dead
with
an
arrow
the
skin
head
and
flesh
of
the
slain
bear
are
brought
into
the
house
not
through
the
door
but
through
the
a
quiver
full
of
arrows
is
laid
under
the
head
and
beside
it
are
deposited
tobacco
sugar
and
other
food
the
soul
of
the
bear
is
supposed
to
carry
off
the
souls
of
these
things
with
it
on
the
far
journey
a
special
vessel
is
used
for
cooking
the
bear
s
flesh
and
the
fire
must
be
kindled
by
a
sacred
apparatus
of
flint
and
steel
which
belongs
to
the
clan
and
is
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
but
which
is
never
used
to
light
fires
except
on
these
solemn
occasions
of
all
the
many
viands
cooked
for
the
consumption
of
the
assembled
people
a
portion
is
placed
in
a
special
vessel
and
set
before
the
bear
s
head
this
is
called
feeding
the
after
the
bear
has
been
killed
dogs
are
sacrificed
in
couples
of
male
and
female
before
being
throttled
they
are
fed
and
invited
to
go
to
their
lord
on
the
highest
mountain
to
change
their
skins
and
to
return
next
year
in
the
form
of
bears
the
soul
of
the
dead
bear
departs
to
the
same
lord
who
is
also
lord
of
the
primaeval
forest
it
goes
away
laden
with
the
offerings
that
have
been
made
to
it
and
attended
by
the
souls
of
the
dogs
and
also
by
the
souls
of
the
sacred
whittled
sticks
which
figure
prominently
at
the
festival
the
goldi
neighbours
of
the
gilyaks
treat
the
bear
in
much
the
same
way
they
hunt
and
kill
it
but
sometimes
they
capture
a
live
bear
and
keep
him
in
a
cage
feeding
him
well
and
calling
him
their
son
and
brother
then
at
a
great
festival
he
is
taken
from
his
cage
paraded
about
with
marked
consideration
and
afterwards
killed
and
eaten
the
skull
and
ears
are
then
suspended
on
a
tree
as
an
antidote
against
evil
spirits
but
the
flesh
is
eaten
and
much
relished
for
they
believe
that
all
who
partake
of
it
acquire
a
zest
for
the
chase
and
become
the
orotchis
another
tunguzian
people
of
the
region
of
the
amoor
hold
of
the
same
general
character
any
one
who
catches
a
bear
cub
considers
it
his
bounden
duty
to
rear
it
in
a
cage
for
about
three
years
in
order
at
the
end
of
that
time
to
kill
it
publicly
and
eat
the
flesh
with
his
friends
the
feasts
being
public
though
organised
by
individuals
the
people
try
to
have
one
in
each
orotchi
village
every
year
in
turn
when
the
bear
is
taken
out
of
his
cage
he
is
led
about
by
means
of
ropes
to
all
the
huts
accompanied
by
people
armed
with
lances
bows
and
arrows
at
each
hut
the
bear
and
are
treated
to
something
good
to
eat
and
drink
this
goes
on
for
several
days
until
all
the
huts
not
only
in
that
village
but
also
in
the
next
have
been
visited
the
days
are
given
up
to
sport
and
noisy
jollity
then
the
bear
is
tied
to
a
tree
or
wooden
pillar
and
shot
to
death
by
the
arrows
of
the
crowd
after
which
its
flesh
is
roasted
and
eaten
among
the
orotchis
of
the
tundja
river
women
take
part
in
the
while
among
the
orotchis
of
the
river
vi
the
women
will
not
even
touch
bear
s
flesh
in
the
treatment
of
the
captive
bear
by
these
tribes
there
are
features
which
can
hardly
be
distinguished
from
worship
such
for
example
are
the
prayers
offered
to
it
both
alive
and
dead
the
offerings
of
food
including
portions
of
its
own
flesh
laid
before
the
animal
s
skull
and
the
gilyak
custom
of
leading
the
living
beast
on
to
the
ice
of
the
river
in
order
to
ensure
a
supply
of
fish
and
of
conducting
him
from
house
to
house
in
order
that
every
family
may
receive
his
blessing
just
as
in
europe
a
or
a
personal
representative
of
the
used
to
be
taken
from
door
to
door
in
spring
for
the
sake
of
diffusing
among
all
and
sundry
the
fresh
energies
of
reviving
nature
again
the
solemn
participation
in
his
flesh
and
blood
and
particularly
the
aino
custom
of
sharing
the
contents
of
the
cup
which
had
been
consecrated
by
being
set
before
the
dead
beast
are
strongly
suggestive
of
a
sacrament
and
the
suggestion
is
confirmed
by
the
gilyak
practice
of
reserving
special
vessels
to
hold
the
flesh
and
cooking
it
on
a
fire
kindled
by
a
sacred
apparatus
which
is
never
employed
except
on
these
religious
occasions
indeed
our
principal
authority
on
aino
religion
the
rev
john
batchelor
frankly
describes
as
worship
the
ceremonious
respect
which
the
aino
pay
to
the
bear
and
he
affirms
that
the
animal
is
undoubtedly
one
of
their
gods
certainly
the
aino
appear
to
apply
their
name
for
god
freely
to
the
bear
but
as
batchelor
himself
points
out
that
word
is
used
with
many
different
shades
of
meaning
and
is
applied
to
a
great
variety
of
objects
so
that
from
its
application
to
the
bear
we
can
not
safely
argue
that
the
animal
is
actually
regarded
as
a
deity
indeed
we
are
expressly
told
that
the
aino
of
saghalien
do
not
consider
the
bear
to
be
a
god
but
only
a
messenger
to
the
gods
and
the
message
with
which
they
charge
the
animal
at
its
death
bears
out
the
statement
apparently
the
gilyaks
also
look
on
the
bear
in
the
light
of
an
envoy
despatched
with
presents
to
the
lord
of
the
mountain
on
whom
the
welfare
of
the
people
depends
at
the
same
time
they
treat
the
animal
as
a
being
of
a
higher
order
than
man
in
fact
as
a
minor
deity
whose
presence
in
the
village
so
long
as
he
is
kept
and
fed
diffuses
blessings
especially
by
keeping
at
bay
the
swarms
of
evil
spirits
who
are
constantly
lying
in
wait
for
people
stealing
their
goods
and
destroying
their
bodies
by
sickness
and
disease
moreover
by
partaking
of
the
flesh
blood
or
broth
of
the
bear
the
gilyaks
the
aino
and
the
goldi
are
all
of
opinion
that
they
acquire
some
portion
of
the
animal
s
mighty
powers
particularly
his
courage
and
strength
no
wonder
therefore
that
they
should
treat
so
great
a
benefactor
with
marks
of
the
highest
respect
and
affection
some
light
may
be
thrown
on
the
ambiguous
attitude
of
the
aino
to
bears
by
comparing
the
similar
treatment
which
they
accord
to
other
creatures
for
example
they
regard
the
as
a
good
deity
who
by
his
hooting
warns
men
of
threatened
evil
and
defends
them
against
it
hence
he
is
loved
trusted
and
devoutly
worshipped
as
a
divine
mediator
between
men
and
the
creator
the
various
names
applied
to
him
are
significant
both
of
his
divinity
and
of
his
mediatorship
whenever
an
opportunity
offers
one
of
these
divine
birds
is
captured
and
kept
in
a
cage
where
he
is
greeted
with
the
endearing
titles
of
beloved
god
and
dear
little
nevertheless
the
time
comes
when
the
dear
little
divinity
is
throttled
and
sent
away
in
his
capacity
of
mediator
to
take
a
message
to
the
superior
gods
or
to
the
creator
himself
the
following
is
the
form
of
prayer
addressed
to
the
when
it
is
about
to
be
sacrificed
beloved
deity

have
brought
you
up
because
we
loved
you
and

to
send

ainu
father
and
an
ainu
mother
reared

now

to
thee
i
have
brought
a
variety
of
good
things

of
the
people
were
possessed
by
demons

were
wounded
by
wild
animals

the
people

in
great

my
father

me
and
hasten
to
look
upon
the
ainu
and
help
if
you
do
this
your
father
will
help
again
the
aino
keep
eagles
in
cages
worship
them
as
divinities
and
ask
them
to
defend
the
people
from
evil
yet
they
offer
the
bird
in
sacrifice
and
when
they
are
about
to
do
so
they
pray
to
him
saying
o
precious
divinity
o
thou
divine
bird
pray
listen
to
my
words
thou
dost
not
belong
to
this
world
for
thy
home

things

to
thy
home

the
glorious
heavens
when
thou
arrivest

deities
of
thy

kind
together
and
thank
them
for
us
for
having
governed
the
world
do
thou
come
again
i
beseech
thee
and
rule
over
us
o
my
precious
one
go
thou
once
more
the
aino
revere
hawks
keep
them
in
cages
and
offer
them
in
sacrifice
at
the
time
of
killing
one
of
them
the
following
prayer
should
be
addressed
to
the
bird
o
divine
hawk
thou
art
an
expert
hunter
please
cause
thy
cleverness
to
descend
on
if
a
hawk
is
well
treated
in
captivity
and
prayed
to
after
this
fashion
when
he
is
about
to
be
killed
he
will
surely
send
help
to
the
hunter
thus
the
aino
hopes
to
profit
in
various
ways
by
slaughtering
the
creatures
which
nevertheless
he
treats
as
divine
he
expects
them
to
carry
messages
for
him
to
their
kindred
or
to
the
gods
in
the
upper
world
he
hopes
to
partake
of
their
virtues
by
imbibing
parts
of
their
bodies
or
in
other
ways
and
apparently
he
looks
forward
to
their
bodily
resurrection
in
this
world
which
will
enable
him
again
to
catch
and
kill
them
and
again
to
reap
all
the
benefits
which
he
has
already
derived
from
their
slaughter
for
in
the
prayers
addressed
to
the
worshipful
bear
and
the
worshipful
eagle
before
they
are
knocked
on
the
head
the
creatures
are
invited
to
come
again
which
seems
clearly
to
point
to
a
faith
in
their
future
resurrection
if
any
doubt
could
exist
on
this
head
it
would
be
dispelled
by
the
evidence
of
batchelor
who
tells
us
that
the
aino
are
firmly
convinced
that
the
spirits
of
birds
and
animals
killed
in
hunting
or
offered
in
sacrifice
come
and
live
again
upon
the
earth
clothed
with
a
body
and
they
believe
further
that
they
appear
here
for
the
special
benefit
of
men
particularly
ainu
the
aino
batchelor
tells
us
confessedly
slays
and
eats
the
beast
that
another
may
come
in
its
place
and
be
treated
in
like
manner
and
at
the
time
of
sacrificing
the
creatures
prayers
are
said
to
them
which
form
a
request
that
they
will
come
again
and
furnish
viands
for
another
feast
as
if
it
were
an
honour
to
them
to
be
thus
killed
and
eaten
and
a
pleasure
as
well
indeed
such
is
the
people
s
these
last
observations
as
the
context
shews
refer
especially
to
the
sacrifice
of
bears
thus
among
the
benefits
which
the
aino
anticipates
from
the
slaughter
of
the
worshipful
animals
not
the
least
substantial
is
that
of
gorging
himself
on
their
flesh
and
blood
both
on
the
present
and
on
many
a
similar
occasion
hereafter
and
that
pleasing
prospect
again
is
derived
from
his
firm
faith
in
the
spiritual
immortality
and
bodily
resurrection
of
the
dead
animals
a
like
faith
is
shared
by
many
savage
hunters
in
many
parts
of
the
world
and
has
given
rise
to
a
variety
of
quaint
customs
some
of
which
will
be
described
presently
meantime
it
is
not
unimportant
to
observe
that
the
solemn
festivals
at
which
the
aino
the
gilyaks
and
other
tribes
slaughter
the
tame
caged
bears
with
demonstrations
of
respect
and
sorrow
are
probably
nothing
but
an
extension
or
glorification
of
similar
rites
which
the
hunter
performs
over
any
wild
bear
which
he
chances
to
kill
in
the
forest
indeed
with
regard
to
the
gilyaks
we
are
expressly
informed
that
this
is
the
case
if
we
would
understand
the
meaning
of
the
gilyak
ritual
says
sternberg
we
must
above
all
remember
that
the
are
not
as
is
usually
but
falsely
assumed
celebrated
only
at
the
killing
of
a
but
are
held
on
every
occasion
when
a
gilyak
succeeds
in
slaughtering
a
bear
in
the
chase
it
is
true
that
in
such
cases
the
festival
assumes
less
imposing
dimensions
but
in
its
essence
it
remains
the
same
when
the
head
and
skin
of
a
bear
killed
in
the
forest
are
brought
into
the
village
they
are
accorded
a
triumphal
reception
with
music
and
solemn
ceremonial
the
head
is
laid
on
a
consecrated
scaffold
fed
and
treated
with
offerings
just
as
at
the
killing
of
a
and
the
guests
of
honour
are
also
assembled
so
too
dogs
are
sacrificed
and
the
bones
of
the
bear
are
preserved
in
the
same
place
and
with
the
same
marks
of
respect
as
the
bones
of
a
hence
the
great
winter
festival
is
only
an
extension
of
the
rite
which
is
observed
at
the
slaughter
of
every
thus
the
apparent
contradiction
in
the
practice
of
these
tribes
who
venerate
and
almost
deify
the
animals
which
they
habitually
hunt
kill
and
eat
is
not
so
flagrant
as
at
first
sight
it
appears
to
us
the
people
have
reasons
and
some
very
practical
reasons
for
acting
as
they
do
for
the
savage
is
by
no
means
so
illogical
and
unpractical
as
to
superficial
observers
he
is
apt
to
seem
he
has
thought
deeply
on
the
questions
which
immediately
concern
him
he
reasons
about
them
and
though
his
conclusions
often
diverge
very
widely
from
ours
we
ought
not
to
deny
him
the
credit
of
patient
and
prolonged
meditation
on
some
fundamental
problems
of
human
existence
in
the
present
case
if
he
treats
bears
in
general
as
creatures
wholly
subservient
to
human
needs
and
yet
singles
out
certain
individuals
of
the
species
for
homage
which
almost
amounts
to
deification
we
must
not
hastily
set
him
down
as
irrational
and
inconsistent
but
must
endeavour
to
place
ourselves
at
his
point
of
view
to
see
things
as
he
sees
them
and
to
divest
ourselves
of
the
prepossessions
which
tinge
so
deeply
our
own
views
of
the
world
if
we
do
so
we
shall
probably
discover
that
however
absurd
his
conduct
may
appear
to
us
the
savage
nevertheless
generally
acts
on
a
train
of
reasoning
which
seems
to
him
in
harmony
with
the
facts
of
his
limited
experience
this
i
propose
to
illustrate
in
the
following
chapter
where
i
shall
attempt
to
shew
that
the
solemn
ceremonial
of
the
among
the
ainos
and
other
tribes
of
asia
is
only
a
particularly
striking
example
of
the
respect
which
on
the
principles
of
his
rude
philosophy
the
savage
habitually
pays
to
the
animals
which
he
kills
and
eats
chapter
xiv
the
propitiation
of
wild
animals
by
hunters
the
explanation
of
life
by
the
theory
of
an
indwelling
and
practically
immortal
soul
is
one
which
the
savage
does
not
confine
to
human
beings
but
extends
to
the
animate
creation
in
general
in
so
doing
he
is
more
liberal
and
perhaps
more
logical
than
the
civilised
man
who
commonly
denies
to
animals
that
privilege
of
immortality
which
he
claims
for
himself
the
savage
is
not
so
proud
he
commonly
believes
that
animals
are
endowed
with
feelings
and
intelligence
like
those
of
men
and
that
like
men
they
possess
souls
which
survive
the
death
of
their
bodies
either
to
wander
about
as
disembodied
spirits
or
to
be
born
again
in
animal
form
thus
for
example
we
are
told
that
the
indian
of
guiana
does
not
see
any
sharp
line
of
distinction
such
as
we
see
between
man
and
other
animals
between
one
kind
of
animal
and
another
or
between
inanimate
objects
on
the
contrary
to
the
indian
all
objects
animate
and
inanimate
seem
exactly
of
the
same
nature
except
that
they
differ
in
the
accident
of
bodily
form
every
object
in
the
whole
world
is
a
being
consisting
of
a
body
and
spirit
and
differs
from
every
other
object
in
no
respect
except
that
of
bodily
form
and
in
the
greater
or
less
degree
of
brute
power
and
brute
cunning
consequent
on
the
difference
of
bodily
form
and
bodily
similarly
we
read
that
in
cherokee
mythology
as
in
that
of
indian
tribes
generally
there
is
no
essential
difference
between
men
and
animals
in
the
primal
genesis
period
they
seem
to
be
completely
undifferentiated
and
we
find
all
creatures
alike
living
and
working
together
in
harmony
and
mutual
helpfulness
until
man
by
his
aggressiveness
and
disregard
for
the
rights
of
the
others
provokes
their
hostility
when
insects
birds
fishes
reptiles
and
fourfooted
beasts
join
forces
against
him
henceforth
their
lives
are
apart
but
the
difference
is
always
one
of
degree
only
the
animals
like
the
people
are
organized
into
tribes
and
have
like
them
their
chiefs
and
townhouses
their
councils
and
ballplays
and
the
same
hereafter
in
the
darkening
land
of
usunhiyi
man
is
still
the
paramount
power
and
hunts
and
slaughters
the
others
as
his
own
necessities
compel
but
is
obliged
to
satisfy
the
animal
tribes
in
every
instance
very
much
as
a
murder
is
compounded
for
according
to
the
indian
system
by
covering
the
bones
of
the
dead
with
presents
for
the
bereaved
to
the
same
effect
another
observer
of
the
north
american
indians
writes
i
have
often
reflected
on
the
curious
connexion
which
appears
to
subsist
in
the
mind
of
an
indian
between
man
and
the
brute
creation
and
found
much
matter
in
it
for
curious
observation
although
they
consider
themselves
superior
to
all
other
animals
and
are
very
proud
of
that
superiority
although
they
believe
that
the
beasts
of
the
forest
the
birds
of
the
air
and
the
fishes
of
the
waters
were
created
by
the
almighty
being
for
the
use
of
man
yet
it
seems
as
if
they
ascribe
the
difference
between
themselves
and
the
brute
kind
and
the
dominion
which
they
have
over
them
more
to
their
superior
bodily
strength
and
dexterity
than
to
their
immortal
souls
all
beings
endowed
by
the
creator
with
the
power
of
volition
and
they
view
in
a
manner
as
a
great
society
of
which
they
are
the
head
whom
they
are
appointed
indeed
to
govern
but
between
whom
and
themselves
intimate
ties
of
connexion
and
relationship
may
exist
or
at
least
did
exist
in
the
beginning
of
time
they
are
in
fact
according
to
their
opinions
only
the
first
among
equals
the
legitimate
hereditary
sovereigns
of
the
whole
animated
race
of
which
they
are
themselves
a
constituent
part
hence
in
their
languages
those
inflections
of
their
nouns
which
we
call
are
not
as
with
us
descriptive
of
the
and
species
but
of
the
and
kinds
indeed
they
go
so
far
as
to
include
trees
and
plants
within
the
first
of
these
descriptions
all
animated
nature
in
whatever
degree
is
in
their
eyes
a
great
whole
from
which
they
have
not
yet
ventured
to
separate
themselves
they
do
not
exclude
other
animals
from
their
world
of
spirits
the
place
to
which
they
expect
to
go
after
even
chinese
authors
have
roundly
avowed
themselves
altogether
unable
to
discover
any
real
difference
between
men
and
animals
and
they
have
drawn
out
the
parallelism
between
the
two
in
some
detail
but
it
is
not
merely
between
the
mental
and
spiritual
nature
of
man
and
the
animals
that
the
savage
traces
a
close
resemblance
even
the
distinction
of
their
bodily
form
appears
sometimes
to
elude
his
dull
apprehension
an
unusually
intelligent
bushman
questioned
by
a
missionary
could
not
state
any
difference
between
a
man
and
a
did
not
know
but
a
buffalo
might
shoot
with
bows
and
arrows
as
well
as
a
man
if
it
had
in
the
opinion
of
the
gilyak
the
form
and
size
of
an
animal
are
merely
a
sort
of
appearance
every
animal
is
in
point
of
fact
a
real
being
like
man
nay
a
gilyak
such
as
himself
but
endowed
with
reason
and
strength
which
often
surpass
those
of
mere
nor
is
it
merely
that
in
the
mental
fog
the
savage
takes
beasts
for
men
he
seems
to
be
nearly
as
ready
to
take
himself
and
his
fellows
for
beasts
when
the
russians
first
landed
on
one
of
the
alaskan
islands
the
people
took
them
for
on
account
of
the
buttons
on
their
we
have
seen
how
some
savages
identify
themselves
with
animals
of
various
sorts
by
eating
the
maggots
bred
in
the
rotting
carcases
of
the
beasts
and
how
thereafter
when
occasion
serves
they
behave
in
their
adopted
characters
by
wriggling
roaring
barking
or
grunting
according
as
they
happen
to
be
lions
jackals
or
hippopotamuses
in
the
island

mabuiag
men

the
sam

cassowary

that
cassowaries
are

nearly
so

all
same
as
relation

is
the
account
they
give
of
their
kinship
with
the
creature
conversely
they
hold
that
they
themselves
are
cassowaries
or
at
all
events
that
they
possess
some
of
the
qualities
of
the
bird
when
a
cassowary
man
went
forth
to
reap
laurels
on
the
field
of
battle
he
used
to
reflect
with
satisfaction
on
the
length
of
his
lower
limbs
my
leg
is
long
and
thin

can
run
and
not
feel

omaha
indians
believe
that
between
a
man
and
the
creature
which
is
his
guardian
spirit
there
subsists
so
close
a
bond
that
the
man
acquires
the
powers
and
qualities
the
virtues
and
defects
of
the
animal
thus
if
a
man
has
seen
a
bear
in
that
vision
at
puberty
which
determines
an
indian
s
guardian
spirit
he
will
be
apt
to
be
wounded
in
battle
because
the
bear
is
a
slow
and
clumsy
animal
and
easily
trapped
if
he
has
dreamed
of
an
eagle
he
will
be
able
to
see
into
the
future
and
foretell
coming
events
because
the
eagle
s
vision
is
keen
and
piercing
similarly
the
thompson
indians
of
british
columbia
imagined
that
every
man
partook
of
the
nature
of
the
animal
which
was
his
guardian
spirit
for
example
a
man
who
had
the
grisly
bear
for
his
protector
would
prove
a
much
fiercer
warrior
than
one
who
had
only
a
crow
a
coyote
or
a
fox
for
his
guardian
spirit
and
before
they
set
out
on
the
these
indians
used
to
perform
a
mimic
battle
in
which
each
man
tricked
out
with
paint
and
feathers
imitated
the
sounds
of
the
animal
that
was
his
guardian
spirit
grunting
and
whooping
in
character
the
bororos
a
tribe
of
indians
in
the
heart
of
brazil
will
have
it
that
they
are
parrots
of
a
gorgeous
red
plumage
which
live
in
the
brazilian
forest
it
is
not
merely
that
their
souls
will
pass
into
these
birds
at
death
but
they
themselves
are
actually
identical
with
them
in
their
life
and
accordingly
they
treat
the
parrots
as
they
might
treat
their
keeping
them
in
captivity
refusing
to
eat
their
flesh
and
mourning
for
them
when
they
die
however
they
kill
the
wild
birds
for
their
feathers
and
though
they
will
not
kill
they
pluck
the
tame
ones
to
deck
their
own
naked
brown
bodies
with
the
gaudy
plumage
of
their
feathered
brethren
thus
to
the
savage
who
regards
all
living
creatures
as
practically
on
a
footing
of
equality
with
man
the
act
of
killing
and
eating
an
animal
must
wear
a
very
different
aspect
from
that
which
the
same
act
presents
to
us
who
regard
the
intelligence
of
animals
as
far
inferior
to
our
own
and
deny
them
the
possession
of
immortal
souls
hence
on
the
principles
of
his
rude
philosophy
the
primitive
hunter
who
slays
an
animal
believes
himself
exposed
to
the
vengeance
either
of
its
disembodied
spirit
or
of
all
the
other
animals
of
the
same
species
whom
he
considers
as
knit
together
like
men
by
the
ties
of
kin
and
the
obligations
of
the
blood
feud
and
therefore
as
bound
to
resent
the
injury
done
to
one
of
their
number
accordingly
the
savage
makes
it
a
rule
to
spare
the
life
of
those
animals
which
he
has
no
pressing
motive
for
killing
at
least
such
fierce
and
dangerous
animals
as
are
likely
to
exact
a
bloody
vengeance
for
the
slaughter
of
one
of
their
kind
crocodiles
are
animals
of
this
sort
they
are
only
found
in
hot
countries
where
as
a
rule
food
is
abundant
and
primitive
man
has
therefore
little
reason
to
kill
them
for
the
sake
of
their
tough
and
unpalatable
flesh
hence
it
is
a
custom
with
some
savages
to
spare
crocodiles
or
rather
only
to
kill
them
in
obedience
to
the
law
of
blood
feud
that
is
as
a
retaliation
for
the
slaughter
of
men
by
crocodiles
for
example
the
dyaks
of
borneo
will
not
kill
a
crocodile
unless
a
crocodile
has
first
killed
a
man
for
why
say
they
should
they
commit
an
act
of
aggression
when
he
and
his
kindred
can
so
easily
repay
them
but
should
the
alligator
take
a
human
life
revenge
becomes
a
sacred
duty
of
the
living
relatives
who
will
trap

in
the
spirit
of
an
officer
of
justice
pursuing
a
criminal
others
even
then
hang
back
reluctant
to
embroil
themselves
in
a
quarrel
which
does
not
concern
them
the
alligator
is
supposed
to
be
pursued
by
a
righteous
nemesis
and
whenever
one
is
caught
they
have
a
profound
conviction
that
it
must
be
the
guilty
one
or
his
when
a
dyak
has
made
up
his
mind
to
take
vengeance
on
the
crocodiles
for
the
death
of
a
kinsman
he
calls
in
the
help
of
a
pangareran
a
man
whose
business
it
is
to
charm
and
catch
crocodiles
and
to
make
them
do
his
will
while
he
is
engaged
in
the
discharge
of
his
professional
duties
the
has
to
observe
a
number
of
odd
rules
he
may
not
go
to
anybody
and
may
not
even
pass
in
front
of
a
window
because
he
is
unclean
he
may
not
himself
cook
anything
nor
come
near
a
fire
if
he
would
eat
fruit
he
may
not
peel
or
husk
it
himself
but
must
get
others
to
do
it
for
him
he
may
not
even
chew
his
food
but
is
obliged
to
swallow
it
unchewed
a
little
hut
is
made
for
him
on
the
bank
of
the
river
where
he
uses
divination
by
means
of
the
figure
of
a
crocodile
drawn
on
a
piece
of
bamboo
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
his
undertaking
will
prosper
the
boat
in
which
he
embarks
to
catch
the
wicked
crocodile
must
be
painted
yellow
and
red
and
in
the
middle
of
it
lances
are
erected
with
the
points
upward
then
the
man
of
skill
casts
lots
to
discover
whether
the
hook
is
to
be
baited
with
pork
or
venison
or
the
flesh
of
a
dog
or
an
ass
in
throwing
the
baited
hook
into
the
water
he
calls
out
ye
crocodiles
who
are
up
stream
come
down
and
ye
crocodiles
who
are
down
stream
come
up
for
i
will
give
you
all
good
food
as
sweet
as
sugar
and
as
fat
as
i
will
give
you
a
pretty
and
beautiful
necklace
when
you
have
got
it
keep
it
in
your
neck
and
body
for
this
food
is
very
which
means
that
it
would
be
sinful
not
to
eat
it
if
a
crocodile
bites
at
the
hook
the
bawls
out
choose
a
place
for
yourself
where
you
will
lie
for
many
men
are
come
to
see
you
they
are
come
joyfully
and
exultingly
and
they
give
you
a
knife
a
lance
and
a
if
the
crocodile
is
a
female
he
addresses
her
as
princess
if
it
is
a
male
he
calls
it
the
enchanter
who
is
generally
a
cunning
malay
must
continue
his
operations
till
he
catches
a
crocodile
in
which
traces
are
to
be
found
shewing
that
the
animal
has
indeed
devoured
a
human
being
then
the
death
of
the
man
is
atoned
for
and
in
order
not
to
offend
the
a
cat
is
sacrificed
to
the
crocodiles
the
heads
of
the
dead
crocodiles
are
fastened
on
stakes
beside
the
river
where
in
time
they
bleach
white
and
stand
out
sharply
against
the
green
background
of
the
forest
while
the
captured
crocodile
is
being
hauled
in
to
the
bank
the
subtle
dyaks
speak
softly
to
him
and
beguile
him
into
offering
no
resistance
but
once
they
have
him
fast
with
arms
and
legs
securely
pinioned
they
howl
at
him
and
deride
him
for
his
credulity
while
they
rip
up
the
belly
of
the
infuriated
and
struggling
brute
to
find
the
evidence
of
his
guilt
in
the
shape
of
human
remains
on
one
occasion
rajah
brooke
of
sarawak
was
present
at
a
discussion
among
a
party
of
dyaks
as
to
how
they
ought
to
treat
a
captured
crocodile
one
side
maintained
that
it
was
proper
to
bestow
all
praise
and
honour
on
the
kingly
beast
since
he
was
himself
a
rajah
among
animals
and
was
now
brought
there
to
meet
the
rajah
in
short
they
held
that
praise
and
flattery
were
agreeable
to
him
and
would
put
him
on
his
best
behaviour
the
other
side
fully
admitted
that
on
this
occasion
rajah
met
rajah
yet
with
prudent
foresight
they
pointed
to
the
dangerous
consequences
which
might
flow
from
establishing
a
precedent
such
as
their
adversaries
contended
for
if
once
a
captured
crocodile
said
they
were
praised
and
honoured
the
other
crocodiles
on
hearing
of
it
would
be
puffed
up
with
pride
and
ambition
and
being
seized
with
a
desire
to
emulate
the
glory
of
their
fellow
would
enter
on
a
career
of
as
the
road
likely
to
lead
them
by
the
shortest
cut
to
the
temple
of
fame
the
minangkabauers
of
sumatra
have
also
a
great
respect
for
crocodiles
their
celebrated
katoemanggoengan
was
indeed
born
again
in
the
form
of
a
crocodile
and
thus
his
descendants
including
the
rajah
of
indrapoera
and
his
family
are
more
or
less
distant
cousins
of
the
crocodiles
and
enjoy
the
help
and
protection
of
the
creatures
in
many
ways
for
example
when
they
go
on
a
journey
the
respect
entertained
for
the
animals
is
also
attested
by
the
ceremonies
observed
in
some
places
when
a
crocodile
has
been
caught
a
crowd
of
women
then
performs
certain
dances
which
closely
resemble
the
dances
performed
when
somebody
has
died
moreover
it
is
a
rule
with
the
minangkabauers
that
no
may
be
washed
in
a
river
to
do
so
would
be
like
offering
the
crocodiles
the
leavings
of
your
food
and
they
would
very
naturally
resent
it
for
the
same
reason
in
washing
up
the
dinner
or
supper
plates
you
must
be
careful
not
to
make
a
splashing
or
the
crocodiles
would
hear
it
and
take
umbrage
among
the
malays
of
patani
bay
in
siam
there
is
a
family
whose
members
may
not
kill
a
crocodile
nor
even
be
present
when
one
of
these
ferocious
reptiles
is
captured
the
reason
alleged
for
this
forbearance
is
that
the
family
claim
kindred
with
a
woman
named
betimor
who
was
drowned
in
the
river
and
afterwards
turned
into
a
crocodile
after
her
transformation
she
appeared
to
her
father
in
a
dream
and
told
him
what
had
become
of
her
so
he
went
down
to
the
river
and
made
offerings
to
her
of
rice
and
wax
tapers
there
is
a
shrine
on
the
spot
where
the
woman
was
transformed
into
a
crocodile
and
any
one
may
dedicate
offerings
there
and
pray
to
toh
sri
lam
for
so
she
has
been
called
ever
since
her
metamorphosis
members
of
the
crocodile
family
call
on
her
for
help
in
sickness
and
other
misfortunes
and
they
will
do
so
on
behalf
of
other
people
for
a
proper
consideration
rice
and
wax
tapers
are
the
usual
offerings
in
many
islands
of
the
indian
archipelago
including
java
sumatra
celebes
timor
and
ceram
this
belief
in
a
kinship
of
men
with
crocodiles
assumes
a
peculiar
form
the
people
imagine
that
women
are
often
delivered
of
a
child
and
a
crocodile
at
the
same
birth
and
that
when
this
happens
the
midwife
carries
the
crocodile
twin
carefully
down
to
the
river
and
places
it
in
the
water
the
family
in
which
such
a
birth
is
thought
to
have
happened
constantly
put
victuals
into
the
river
for
their
amphibious
relation
and
in
particular
the
human
twin
so
long
as
he
lives
goes
down
to
the
river
at
stated
seasons
to
do
his
duty
by
his
crocodile
brother
or
sister
and
if
he
were
to
fail
to
do
so
it
is
the
universal
opinion
that
he
would
be
visited
with
sickness
or
death
for
his
unnatural
conduct
large
parties
of
these
crocodile
people
periodically
go
out
in
a
boat
furnished
with
great
plenty
of
provisions
and
all
kinds
of
music
and
they
row
backwards
and
forwards
with
the
music
playing
in
places
where
crocodiles
do
most
abound
as
they
do
so
they
sing
and
weep
by
turns
each
of
them
invoking
his
animal
kinsfolk
till
the
snout
of
one
of
the
brutes
bobbs
up
from
the
water
whereupon
the
music
stops
and
food
betel
and
tobacco
are
thrown
into
the
river
by
these
delicate
attentions
they
hope
to
recommend
themselves
to
the
formidable
creatures
the
crocodiles
about
the
island
of
damba
in
the
victoria
nyanza
were
sacred
and
might
not
be
molested
in
any
way
hence
they
multiplied
and
became
dangerous
people
made
offerings
to
them
in
the
hope
of
being
spared
by
the
monsters
when
they
crossed
in
the
ferries
from
time
to
time
batches
of
men
were
brought
down
to
the
beach
and
sacrificed
to
the
crocodiles
their
arms
and
legs
were
broken
so
that
they
could
not
stir
from
the
spot
then
they
were
laid
out
in
a
row
on
the
shore
and
the
crocodiles
came
and
dragged
them
into
the
water
on
the
island
there
was
a
temple
dedicated
to
the
crocodiles
and
here
an
inspired
medium
resided
who
gave
oracular
responses
under
the
influence
of
the
spirit
he
wagged
his
head
from
side
to
side
opening
his
jaws
and
snapping
them
together
just
as
a
crocodile
does
no
doubt
the
spirit
which
possessed
him
in
these
moments
of
fine
frenzy
was
supposed
to
be
that
of
a
crocodile
similarly
in
other
parts
of
uganda
men
were
inspired
by
the
ghosts
or
spirits
of
lions
leopards
and
serpents
and
in
that
state
of
exaltation
they
uttered
oracles
roaring
like
a
lion
growling
like
a
leopard
or
grovelling
and
wriggling
like
a
serpent
according
to
the
nature
of
the
spirit
by
which
they
were
possessed
crocodiles
abound
in
the
albert
nyanza
lake
and
its
tributaries
in
many
places
they
are
extremely
dangerous
but
the
alur
tribe
of
that
region
only
hunt
them
when
they
have
dragged
away
a
man
and
they
think
that
any
one
who
has
taken
away
a
crocodile
s
eggs
must
be
on
his
guard
when
he
walks
near
the
bank
of
the
river
for
the
crocodiles
will
try
to
avenge
the
injury
by
seizing
him
in
general
the
foulahs
of
senegambia
dare
not
kill
a
crocodile
from
fear
of
provoking
the
vengeance
of
the
relations
and
friends
of
the
murdered
reptile
but
if
the
sorcerer
gives
his
consent
and
passes
his
word
that
he
will
guarantee
them
against
the
vengeance
of
the
family
of
the
deceased
they
will
pluck
up
courage
to
attack
one
of
the
brutes
like
the
dyaks
the
natives
of
madagascar
never
kill
a
crocodile
except
in
retaliation
for
one
of
their
friends
who
has
been
destroyed
by
a
crocodile
they
believe
that
the
wanton
destruction
of
one
of
these
reptiles
will
be
followed
by
the
loss
of
human
life
in
accordance
with
the
principle
of
the
people
who
live
near
the
lake
itasy
in
madagascar
make
a
yearly
proclamation
to
the
crocodiles
announcing
that
they
will
revenge
the
death
of
some
of
their
friends
by
killing
as
many
crocodiles
in
return
and
warning
all
crocodiles
to
keep
out
of
the
way
as
they
have
no
quarrel
with
them
but
only
with
their
relations
who
have
taken
human
life
various
tribes
of
madagascar
believe
themselves
to
be
descended
from
crocodiles
and
accordingly
they
view
the
scaly
reptile
as
to
all
intents
and
purposes
a
man
and
a
brother
if
one
of
the
animals
should
so
far
forget
himself
as
to
devour
one
of
his
human
kinsfolk
the
chief
of
the
tribe
or
in
his
absence
an
old
man
familiar
with
the
tribal
customs
repairs
at
the
head
of
the
people
to
the
edge
of
the
water
and
summons
the
family
of
the
culprit
to
deliver
him
up
to
the
arm
of
justice
a
hook
is
then
baited
and
cast
into
the
river
or
lake
next
day
the
guilty
brother
or
one
of
his
family
is
dragged
ashore
and
after
his
crime
has
been
clearly
brought
home
to
him
by
a
strict
interrogation
he
is
sentenced
to
death
and
executed
the
claims
of
justice
being
thus
satisfied
and
the
majesty
of
the
law
fully
vindicated
the
deceased
crocodile
is
lamented
and
buried
like
a
kinsman
a
mound
is
raised
over
his
relics
and
a
stone
marks
the
place
of
his
head
the
malagasy
indeed
regard
the
crocodile
with
superstitious
veneration
as
the
king
of
the
waters
and
supreme
in
his
own
element
when
they
are
about
to
cross
a
river
they
pronounce
a
solemn
oath
or
enter
into
an
engagement
to
acknowledge
his
sovereignty
over
the
waters
an
aged
native
has
been
known
to
covenant
with
the
crocodiles
for
nearly
half
an
hour
before
plunging
into
the
stream
after
that
he
lifted
up
his
voice
and
addressed
the
animal
urging
him
to
do
him
no
harm
since
he
had
never
hurt
the
crocodile
assuring
him
that
he
had
never
made
war
on
any
of
his
fellows
but
on
the
contrary
had
always
entertained
the
highest
veneration
for
him
and
adding
that
if
he
wantonly
attacked
him
vengeance
would
follow
sooner
or
later
while
if
the
crocodile
devoured
him
his
relations
and
all
his
race
would
declare
war
against
the
beast
this
harangue
occupied
another
quarter
of
an
hour
after
which
the
orator
dashed
fearlessly
into
the
stream
again
the
tiger
is
another
of
those
dangerous
beasts
whom
the
savage
prefers
to
leave
alone
lest
by
killing
one
of
the
species
he
should
excite
the
hostility
of
the
rest
no
consideration
will
induce
a
sumatran
to
catch
or
wound
a
tiger
except
in
or
immediately
after
a
tiger
has
destroyed
a
friend
or
relation
when
a
european
has
set
traps
for
tigers
the
people
of
the
neighbourhood
have
been
known
to
go
by
night
to
the
place
and
explain
to
the
animals
that
the
traps
are
not
set
by
them
nor
with
their
consent
if
it
is
necessary
to
kill
a
tiger
which
has
wrought
much
harm
in
the
village
the
minangkabauers
of
sumatra
try
to
catch
him
alive
in
order
to
beg
for
his
forgiveness
before
despatching
him
and
in
ordinary
life
they
will
not
speak
evil
of
him
or
do
anything
that
might
displease
him
for
example
they
will
not
use
a
path
that
has
been
untrodden
for
more
than
a
year
because
the
tiger
has
chosen
that
path
for
himself
and
would
deem
it
a
mark
of
disrespect
were
any
one
else
to
use
it
again
persons
journeying
by
night
will
not
walk
one
behind
the
other
nor
keep
looking
about
them
for
the
tiger
would
think
that
this
betrayed
fear
of
him
and
his
feelings
would
be
hurt
by
the
suspicion
neither
will
they
travel
bareheaded
for
that
also
would
be
disrespectful
to
the
tiger
nor
will
they
knock
off
the
glowing
end
of
a
firebrand
for
the
flying
sparks
are
like
the
tiger
s
glistering
eyes
and
he
would
treat
this
as
an
attempt
to
mimic
him
the
population
of
mandeling
a
district
on
the
west
coast
of
sumatra
is
divided
into
clans
one
of
which
claims
to
be
descended
from
a
tiger
it
is
believed
that
the
animal
will
not
attack
or
rend
the
members
of
this
clan
because
they
are
his
kinsmen
when
members
of
the
clan
come
upon
the
tracks
of
a
tiger
they
enclose
them
with
three
little
sticks
as
a
mark
of
homage
and
when
a
tiger
has
been
shot
the
women
of
the
clan
are
bound
to
offer
betel
to
the
dead
beast
the
battas
of
sumatra
seldom
kill
a
tiger
except
from
motives
of
revenge
observing
the
rule
an
eye
for
an
eye
and
a
tooth
for
a
tooth
or
as
they
express
it
he
who
owes
gold
must
pay
in
gold
he
who
owes
breath
that
is
life
must
pay
with
nor
can
the
beast
be
attacked
without
some
ceremony
only
weapons
that
have
proved
themselves
able
to
kill
may
be
used
for
the
purpose
when
the
tiger
has
been
killed
they
bring
the
carcase
to
the
village
set
offerings
before
it
and
burn
incense
over
it
praying
the
spirit
of
the
tiger
to
quit
its
material
envelope
and
enter
the
incense
pot
as
soon
as
the
soul
may
be
supposed
to
have
complied
with
this
request
a
speaker
explains
to
the
spirits
in
general
the
reasons
for
killing
the
tiger
and
begs
them
to
set
forth
these
reasons
to
the
departed
soul
of
the
beast
lest
the
latter
should
be
angry
and
the
people
should
suffer
in
consequence
then
they
dance
round
the
dead
body
of
the
tiger
till
they
can
dance
no
longer
after
which
they
skin
the
carcase
and
bury
it
the
inhabitants
of
the
hills
near
rajamahall
in
bengal
believe
that
if
any
man
kills
a
tiger
without
divine
orders
either
he
or
one
of
his
relations
will
be
devoured
by
a
tiger
hence
they
are
very
averse
to
killing
a
tiger
unless
one
of
their
kinsfolk
has
been
carried
off
by
one
of
the
beasts
in
that
case
they
go
out
for
the
purpose
of
hunting
and
slaying
a
tiger
and
when
they
have
succeeded
they
lay
their
bows
and
arrows
on
the
carcase
and
invoke
god
declaring
that
they
slew
the
animal
in
retaliation
for
the
loss
of
a
kinsman
vengeance
having
been
thus
taken
they
swear
not
to
attack
another
tiger
except
under
similar
provocation
the
natives
of
cochin
china
have
a
great
respect
for
the
tiger
whom
they
regard
as
a
terrible
divinity
yet
they
set
traps
for
him
and
leave
no
stone
unturned
to
catch
him
once
he
is
ensnared
they
offer
him
their
excuses
and
condolences
for
the
painful
position
in
which
he
finds
himself
the
indians
of
carolina
would
not
molest
snakes
when
they
came
upon
them
but
would
pass
by
on
the
other
side
of
the
path
believing
that
if
they
were
to
kill
a
serpent
the
reptile
s
kindred
would
destroy
some
of
their
brethren
friends
or
relations
in
return
so
the
seminole
indians
spared
the
rattlesnake
because
they
feared
that
the
soul
of
the
dead
rattlesnake
would
incite
its
kinsfolk
to
take
vengeance
once
when
a
rattlesnake
appeared
in
their
camp
they
entreated
an
english
traveller
to
rid
them
of
the
creature
when
he
had
killed
it
they
were
glad
but
tried
to
scratch
him
as
a
means
of
appeasing
the
spirit
of
the
dead
snake
soon
after
the
iowas
began
to
build
their
village
near
the
mouth
of
wolf
river
a
lad
came
into
the
village
and
reported
that
he
had
seen
a
rattlesnake
on
a
hill
not
far
off
a
immediately
repaired
to
the
spot
and
finding
the
snake
made
it
presents
of
tobacco
and
other
things
which
he
had
brought
with
him
for
the
purpose
he
also
had
a
long
talk
with
the
animal
and
on
returning
to
his
people
told
them
that
now
they
might
travel
about
in
safety
for
peace
had
been
made
with
the
snakes
the
delaware
indians
also
paid
great
respect
to
the
rattlesnake
whom
they
called
their
grandfather
and
they
would
on
no
account
destroy
one
of
the
reptiles
they
said
that
the
rattlesnake
guarded
them
and
gave
them
notice
of
impending
danger
by
his
rattle
and
that
if
they
were
to
kill
a
rattlesnake
the
rest
of
the
species
would
soon
hear
of
it
and
bite
the
indians
in
revenge
the
potawatomi
indians
highly
venerated
the
rattlesnake
for
a
similar
reason
being
grateful
to
it
for
the
timely
warning
which
it
often
gave
of
the
approach
of
an
enemy
yet
a
young
man
who
desired
to
obtain
a
rattle
would
have
no
hesitation
in
killing
one
of
the
snakes
for
the
purpose
but
he
apologised
profusely
to
the
creature
for
the
liberty
he
took
with
it
explaining
that
he
required
the
rattle
for
the
adornment
of
his
person
and
that
no
disrespect
was
intended
to
the
snake
and
in
proof
of
his
good
will
he
would
leave
a
piece
of
tobacco
beside
the
carcase
the
cherokee
regard
the
rattlesnake
as
the
chief
of
the
snake
tribe
and
fear
and
respect
him
accordingly
few
cherokee
will
venture
to
kill
a
rattlesnake
unless
they
can
not
help
it
and
even
then
they
must
atone
for
the
crime
by
craving
pardon
of
the
snake
s
ghost
either
in
their
own
person
or
through
the
mediation
of
a
priest
according
to
a
set
formula
if
these
precautions
are
neglected
the
kinsfolk
of
the
dead
snake
will
send
one
of
their
number
as
an
avenger
of
blood
who
will
track
down
the
murderer
and
sting
him
to
death
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
cut
off
the
snake
s
head
and
bury
it
deep
in
the
earth
and
to
hide
the
body
in
a
hollow
log
for
if
the
remains
were
exposed
to
the
weather
the
other
snakes
would
be
so
angry
that
they
would
send
torrents
of
rain
and
all
the
streams
would
overflow
their
banks
if
a
cherokee
dreams
of
being
bitten
by
a
snake
he
must
be
treated
in
exactly
the
same
way
as
if
he
had
been
really
bitten
for
they
think
that
he
has
actually
been
bitten
by
the
ghost
of
a
snake
and
that
if
the
proper
remedies
were
not
applied
to
the
hurt
the
place
would
swell
and
ulcerate
though
possibly
not
for
years
afterwards
once
when
an
englishman
attempted
to
kill
a
rattlesnake
a
party
of
ojibway
indians
with
whom
he
was
travelling
begged
him
to
desist
and
endeavoured
to
appease
the
snake
addressing
it
in
turns
as
grandfather
smoking
over
it
and
beseeching
it
to
take
care
of
their
families
in
their
absence
and
to
open
the
heart
of
the
british
agent
so
that
he
should
fill
their
canoe
with
rum
a
storm
which
overtook
them
next
day
on
lake
huron
was
attributed
by
them
to
the
wrath
of
the
insulted
rattlesnake
and
they
sought
to
mollify
him
by
throwing
dogs
as
sacrifices
to
him
into
the
waves
the
kekchi
indians
of
guatemala
will
not
throw
serpents
or
scorpions
into
the
fire
lest
the
other
creatures
of
the
same
species
should
punish
them
for
the
outrage
in
kiziba
a
district
of
central
africa
to
the
west
of
lake
victoria
nyanza
if
a
woman
accidentally
kills
a
snake
with
her
hoe
while
she
is
working
in
the
field
she
hastens
in
great
agitation
to
the
and
hands
him
over
the
hoe
together
with
two
strings
of
cowries
and
an
begging
him
to
appease
the
angry
spirit
of
the
slain
serpent
in
this
application
she
is
accompanied
and
supported
by
all
the
villagers
who
share
her
fears
and
anxiety
accordingly
the
priest
beats
his
drum
as
a
sign
that
no
woman
of
the
village
is
to
work
in
the
fields
till
further
notice
next
he
wraps
the
dead
serpent
in
a
piece
of
the
and
buries
it
solemnly
on
the
following
day
he
performs
a
ceremony
of
purification
for
the
slaughter
of
the
reptile
he
compounds
a
medicine
out
of
the
guts
of
a
leopard
or
hyaena
and
earth
or
mud
dissolved
in
water
and
with
this
mixture
he
disinfects
all
the
houses
in
the
village
beginning
with
the
house
of
the
woman
who
killed
the
serpent
next
he
proceeds
to
the
fields
where
all
the
women
of
the
village
have
collected
their
hoes
these
he
purifies
by
dipping
them
in
the
fluid
and
then
twirling
them
about
so
as
to
make
the
drops
of
water
fly
off
from
that
moment
the
danger
incurred
by
the
slaughter
of
the
reptile
is
averted
the
spirit
of
the
serpent
is
appeased
and
the
women
may
resume
their
usual
labours
in
the
fields
when
the
kwakiutl
indians
of
british
columbia
have
slain
a
wolf
they
lay
the
carcase
on
a
blanket
and
take
out
the
heart
of
which
every
person
who
helped
to
kill
the
beast
must
eat
four
morsels
then
they
wail
over
the
body
saying
woe
our
great
friend
after
that
they
cover
the
carcase
with
a
blanket
and
bury
it
a
bow
or
gun
that
killed
a
wolf
is
regarded
as
unlucky
and
the
owner
gives
it
away
these
indians
believe
that
the
slaying
of
a
wolf
produces
a
scarcity
of
game
when
the
tinneh
indians
of
central
alaska
have
killed
a
wolf
or
a
wolverine
the
carcase
is
brought
into
the
camp
or
village
with
great
pomp
the
people
go
forth
to
meet
it
saying
the
chief
is
then
the
body
is
carried
into
a
hut
and
propped
up
in
a
sitting
posture
and
the
spreads
before
it
a
copious
banquet
to
which
every
family
in
the
village
has
contributed
of
its
best
when
the
dead
animal
is
supposed
to
have
satisfied
his
hunger
the
men
consume
the
remains
of
the
feast
but
no
woman
is
allowed
to
participate
in
what
has
been
thus
offered
to
the
wolf
or
the
wolverine
no
ordinary
cherokee
dares
to
kill
a
wolf
if
he
can
possibly
help
it
for
he
believes
that
the
kindred
of
the
slain
beast
would
surely
avenge
its
death
and
that
the
weapon
with
which
the
deed
had
been
done
would
be
quite
useless
for
the
future
unless
it
were
cleaned
and
exorcised
by
a
however
certain
persons
who
know
the
proper
rites
of
atonement
for
such
a
crime
can
kill
wolves
with
impunity
and
they
are
sometimes
hired
to
do
so
by
people
who
have
suffered
from
the
raids
of
the
wolves
on
their
cattle
or
the
professional
prays
to
the
animal
whom
he
has
bereaved
of
life
and
seeks
to
avert
the
vengeance
of
the
other
wolves
by
laying
the
blame
of
the
slaughter
on
the
people
of
another
settlement
to
purify
the
gun
which
has
perpetrated
the
murder
he
unscrews
the
barrel
inserts
into
it
seven
small
rods
which
have
been
heated
in
the
fire
and
then
allows
the
barrel
and
its
contents
to
lie
in
a
running
stream
till
morning
when
the
chuckchees
of
siberia
have
killed
a
wolf
they
hold
a
festival
at
which
they
cry
wolf
be
not
angry
with
us
it
was
not
we
who
killed
you
it
was
the
russians
who
destroyed
in
ancient
athens
any
man
who
killed
a
wolf
had
to
bury
it
by
subscription
in
a
district
of
the
eastern
sudan
it
is
forbidden
to
touch
the
nests
or
remove
the
young
of
a
species
of
black
birds
resembling
our
blackbirds
because
the
people
believe
that
the
parent
birds
would
avenge
the
wrong
by
causing
a
stormy
wind
to
blow
which
would
destroy
the
harvest
some
of
the
sudanese
negroes
of
upper
egypt
regard
the
great
black
raven
as
their
uncle
and
exact
pecuniary
compensation
or
from
any
one
who
has
been
so
rash
as
to
slay
their
sable
relative
having
satisfied
their
scruples
on
that
head
they
give
the
bird
a
solemn
burial
carrying
the
corpse
to
the
graveyard
on
a
bier
with
flags
and
shouts
of
ill
just
as
if
they
were
interring
one
of
their
kinsfolk
the
palenques
of
south
america
are
very
careful
to
spare
harmless
animals
which
are
not
good
for
food
because
they
believe
that
any
injury
inflicted
on
such
creatures
would
entail
the
sickness
or
death
of
their
own
children
but
the
savage
clearly
can
not
afford
to
spare
all
animals
he
must
either
eat
some
of
them
or
starve
and
when
the
question
thus
comes
to
be
whether
he
or
the
animal
must
perish
he
is
forced
to
overcome
his
superstitious
scruples
and
take
the
life
of
the
beast
at
the
same
time
he
does
all
he
can
to
appease
his
victims
and
their
kinsfolk
even
in
the
act
of
killing
them
he
testifies
his
respect
for
them
endeavours
to
excuse
or
even
conceal
his
share
in
procuring
their
death
and
promises
that
their
remains
will
be
honourably
treated
by
thus
robbing
death
of
its
terrors
he
hopes
to
reconcile
his
victims
to
their
fate
and
to
induce
their
fellows
to
come
and
be
killed
also
for
example
it
was
a
principle
with
the
kamtchatkans
never
to
kill
a
land
or
sea
animal
without
first
making
excuses
to
it
and
begging
that
the
animal
would
not
take
it
also
they
offered
it
and
so
forth
to
make
it
think
that
it
was
not
a
victim
but
a
guest
at
a
feast
they
believed
that
this
hindered
other
animals
of
the
same
species
from
growing
shy
for
instance
after
they
had
killed
a
bear
and
feasted
on
its
flesh
the
host
would
bring
the
bear
s
head
before
the
company
wrap
it
in
grass
and
present
it
with
a
variety
of
trifles
then
he
would
lay
the
blame
of
the
bear
s
death
on
the
russians
and
bid
the
beast
wreak
his
wrath
upon
them
also
he
would
ask
the
bear
to
inform
the
other
bears
how
well
he
had
been
treated
that
they
too
might
come
without
fear
seals
and
other
animals
were
treated
by
the
kamtchatkans
with
the
same
ceremonious
respect
moreover
they
used
to
insert
sprigs
of
a
plant
resembling
bear
s
wort
in
the
mouths
of
the
animals
they
killed
after
which
they
would
exhort
the
grinning
skulls
to
have
no
fear
but
to
go
and
tell
it
to
their
fellows
that
they
also
might
come
and
be
caught
and
so
partake
of
this
splendid
hospitality
when
the
ostiaks
have
hunted
and
killed
a
bear
they
cut
off
its
head
and
hang
it
on
a
tree
then
they
gather
round
in
a
circle
and
pay
it
divine
honours
next
they
run
towards
the
carcase
uttering
lamentations
and
saying
who
killed
you
it
was
the
russians
who
cut
off
your
head
it
was
a
russian
axe
who
skinned
you
it
was
a
knife
made
by
a
they
explain
too
that
the
feathers
which
sped
the
arrow
on
its
flight
came
from
the
wing
of
a
strange
bird
and
that
they
did
nothing
but
let
the
arrow
go
they
do
all
this
because
they
believe
that
the
wandering
ghost
of
the
slain
bear
would
attack
them
on
the
first
opportunity
if
they
did
not
thus
appease
it
or
they
stuff
the
skin
of
the
slain
bear
with
hay
and
after
celebrating
their
victory
with
songs
of
mockery
and
insult
after
spitting
on
and
kicking
it
they
set
it
up
on
its
hind
legs
and
then
for
a
considerable
time
they
bestow
on
it
all
the
veneration
due
to
a
guardian
when
a
party
of
koryak
have
killed
a
bear
or
a
wolf
they
skin
the
beast
and
dress
one
of
themselves
in
the
skin
then
they
dance
round
the
man
saying
that
it
was
not
they
who
killed
the
animal
but
some
one
else
generally
a
russian
when
they
kill
a
fox
they
skin
it
wrap
the
body
in
grass
and
bid
him
go
tell
his
companions
how
hospitably
he
has
been
received
and
how
he
has
received
a
new
cloak
instead
of
his
old
one
a
fuller
account
of
the
koryak
ceremonies
is
given
by
a
more
recent
writer
he
tells
us
that
when
a
dead
bear
is
brought
to
the
house
the
women
come
out
to
meet
it
dancing
with
firebrands
the
is
taken
off
along
with
the
head
and
one
of
the
women
puts
on
the
skin
dances
in
it
and
entreats
the
bear
not
to
be
angry
but
to
be
kind
to
the
people
at
the
same
time
they
offer
meat
on
a
wooden
platter
to
the
dead
beast
saying
eat
afterwards
a
ceremony
is
performed
for
the
purpose
of
sending
the
dead
bear
or
rather
his
spirit
away
back
to
his
home
he
is
provided
with
provisions
for
the
journey
in
the
shape
of
puddings
or
packed
in
a
grass
bag
his
skin
is
stuffed
with
grass
and
carried
round
the
house
after
which
he
is
supposed
to
depart
towards
the
rising
sun
the
intention
of
the
ceremonies
is
to
protect
the
people
from
the
wrath
of
the
slain
bear
and
his
kinsfolk
and
so
to
ensure
success
in
future
the
finns
used
to
try
to
persuade
a
slain
bear
that
he
had
not
been
killed
by
them
but
had
fallen
from
a
tree
or
met
his
death
in
some
other
way
moreover
they
held
a
funeral
festival
in
his
honour
at
the
close
of
which
bards
expatiated
on
the
homage
that
had
been
paid
to
him
urging
him
to
report
to
the
other
bears
the
high
consideration
with
which
he
had
been
treated
in
order
that
they
also
following
his
example
might
come
and
be
slain
when
the
lapps
had
succeeded
in
killing
a
bear
with
impunity
they
thanked
him
for
not
hurting
them
and
for
not
breaking
the
clubs
and
spears
which
had
given
him
his
death
wounds
and
they
prayed
that
he
would
not
visit
his
death
upon
them
by
sending
storms
or
in
any
other
way
his
flesh
then
furnished
a
feast
the
reverence
of
hunters
for
the
bear
whom
they
regularly
kill
and
eat
may
thus
be
traced
all
along
the
northern
region
of
the
old
world
from
bering
s
straits
to
lappland
it
reappears
in
similar
forms
in
north
america
with
the
american
indians
a
bear
hunt
was
an
important
event
for
which
they
prepared
by
long
fasts
and
purgations
before
setting
out
they
offered
expiatory
sacrifices
to
the
souls
of
bears
slain
in
previous
hunts
and
besought
them
to
be
favourable
to
the
hunters
when
a
bear
was
killed
the
hunter
lit
his
pipe
and
putting
the
mouth
of
it
between
the
bear
s
lips
blew
into
the
bowl
filling
the
beast
s
mouth
with
smoke
then
he
begged
the
bear
not
to
be
angry
at
having
been
killed
and
not
to
thwart
him
afterwards
in
the
chase
the
carcase
was
roasted
whole
and
eaten
not
a
morsel
of
the
flesh
might
be
left
over
the
head
painted
red
and
blue
was
hung
on
a
post
and
addressed
by
orators
who
heaped
praise
on
the
dead
beast
when
men
of
the
bear
clan
in
the
otawa
tribe
killed
a
bear
they
made
him
a
feast
of
his
own
flesh
and
addressed
him
thus
cherish
us
no
grudge
because
we
have
killed
you
you
have
sense
you
see
that
our
children
are
hungry
they
love
you
and
wish
to
take
you
into
their
bodies
is
it
not
glorious
to
be
eaten
by
the
children
of
a
chief
amongst
the
nootka
indians
of
british
columbia
when
a
bear
had
been
killed
it
was
brought
in
and
seated
before
the
head
chief
in
an
upright
posture
with
a
chief
s
bonnet
wrought
in
figures
on
its
head
and
its
fur
powdered
over
with
white
down
a
tray
of
provisions
was
then
set
before
it
and
it
was
invited
by
words
and
gestures
to
eat
after
that
the
animal
was
skinned
boiled
and
eaten
the
assiniboins
pray
to
the
bear
and
offer
sacrifices
to
it
of
tobacco
belts
and
other
valuable
objects
moreover
they
hold
feasts
in
its
honour
that
they
may
win
the
beast
s
favour
and
live
safe
and
sound
the
bear
s
head
is
often
kept
in
camp
for
several
days
mounted
in
some
suitable
position
and
decked
with
scraps
of
scarlet
cloth
necklaces
collars
and
coloured
feathers
they
offer
the
pipe
to
it
and
pray
that
they
may
be
able
to
kill
all
the
bears
they
meet
without
harm
to
themselves
for
the
purpose
of
anointing
themselves
with
his
fine
grease
and
banqueting
on
his
tender
flesh
the
ojibways
will
not
suffer
dogs
to
eat
the
flesh
or
gnaw
the
bones
of
a
bear
and
they
throw
all
the
waste
portions
into
the
fire
they
think
that
if
the
flesh
were
desecrated
they
would
have
no
luck
in
hunting
bears
thereafter
a
trader
of
the
eighteenth
century
has
described
the
endearments
which
a
party
of
ojibways
lavished
on
a
which
he
had
just
killed
they
took
her
head
in
their
hands
stroked
it
and
kissed
it
and
begged
a
thousand
pardons
for
her
violent
death
they
called
her
their
relation
and
grandmother
and
begged
her
not
to
lay
the
fault
at
their
door
for
indeed
it
was
an
englishman
who
had
killed
her
having
severed
the
head
from
the
body
they
adorned
it
with
all
the
trinkets
they
could
muster
and
set
it
up
on
a
scaffold
in
the
lodge
next
day
pipes
were
lit
and
tobacco
smoke
blown
into
the
nostrils
of
the
dead
bear
and
the
trader
was
invited
to
pay
this
mark
of
respect
to
the
animal
as
an
atonement
for
having
taken
her
life
before
they
feasted
on
the
bear
s
flesh
an
orator
made
a
speech
in
which
he
deplored
the
sad
necessity
under
which
they
laboured
of
destroying
their
friends
the
bears
for
how
otherwise
could
they
subsist
some
of
the
indians
of
the
queen
charlotte
islands
off
the
coast
of
america
used
to
mark
the
skins
of
bears
otters
and
other
animals
with
four
red
crosses
in
a
line
by
way
of
propitiating
the
spirit
of
the
beast
they
had
killed
when
the
thompson
indians
of
british
columbia
were
about
to
hunt
bears
they
would
sometimes
address
the
animal
and
ask
it
to
come
and
be
shot
they
prayed
the
grisly
bear
not
to
be
angry
with
the
hunter
nor
to
fight
him
but
rather
to
have
pity
on
him
and
to
deliver
himself
up
to
his
mercies
the
man
who
intended
to
hunt
the
grisly
bear
had
to
be
chaste
for
some
time
before
he
set
out
on
his
dangerous
adventure
when
he
had
killed
a
bear
he
and
his
companions
painted
their
faces
in
alternate
perpendicular
stripes
of
black
and
red
and
sang
the
bear
song
sometimes
the
hunter
also
prayed
thanking
the
beast
for
letting
itself
be
killed
so
easily
and
begging
that
its
mate
might
share
the
same
fate
after
they
had
eaten
the
flesh
of
the
bear
s
head
they
tied
the
skull
to
the
top
of
a
small
tree
as
high
as
they
could
reach
and
left
it
there
having
done
so
they
painted
their
faces
with
alternate
stripes
of
red
and
black
as
before
for
if
they
failed
to
observe
this
ceremony
the
bears
would
be
offended
and
the
hunters
would
not
be
able
to
kill
any
more
to
place
the
heads
of
bears
or
any
large
beasts
on
trees
or
stones
was
a
mark
of
respect
to
the
animals
the
lillooet
and
shuswap
indians
of
the
same
region
used
to
observe
similar
ceremonies
at
the
killing
of
a
bear
a
like
respect
is
testified
for
other
dangerous
creatures
by
the
hunters
who
regularly
trap
and
kill
them
when
caffre
hunters
are
in
the
act
of
showering
spears
on
an
elephant
they
call
out
don
t
kill
us
great
captain
don
t
strike
or
tread
upon
us
mighty
when
he
is
dead
they
make
their
excuses
to
him
pretending
that
his
death
was
a
pure
accident
as
a
mark
of
respect
they
bury
his
trunk
with
much
solemn
ceremony
for
they
say
that
the
elephant
is
a
great
lord
his
trunk
is
his
before
the
amaxosa
caffres
attack
an
elephant
they
shout
to
the
animal
and
beg
him
to
pardon
them
for
the
slaughter
they
are
about
to
perpetrate
professing
great
submission
to
his
person
and
explaining
clearly
the
need
they
have
of
his
tusks
to
enable
them
to
procure
beads
and
supply
their
wants
when
they
have
killed
him
they
bury
in
the
ground
along
with
the
end
of
his
trunk
a
few
of
the
articles
they
have
obtained
for
the
ivory
thus
hoping
to
avert
some
mishap
that
would
otherwise
befall
them
among
the
wanyamwezi
of
central
africa
when
hunters
have
killed
an
elephant
they
bury
his
legs
on
the
spot
where
he
fell
and
then
cover
the
place
with
stones
the
burial
is
supposed
to
appease
the
spirit
of
the
dead
elephant
and
to
ensure
the
success
of
the
hunters
in
future
undertakings
when
the
baganda
have
killed
an
elephant
they
extract
the
nerve
from
the
tusk
and
bury
it
taking
care
to
mark
the
place
of
the
burial
for
they
think
that
the
ghost
of
the
dead
elephant
attaches
itself
to
the
nerve
and
that
if
a
hunter
were
to
step
over
the
nerve
the
elephant
s
ghost
would
cause
him
to
be
killed
by
an
elephant
the
next
time
he
went
forth
to
hunt
the
beasts
in
latuka
a
district
of
the
upper
nile
lions
are
much
respected
and
are
only
killed
when
they
prove
very
troublesome
and
dangerous
there
used
to
be
in
this
region
a
as
he
was
called
who
professed
to
have
all
lions
under
his
control
and
who
actually
kept
several
tame
lions
about
his
house
whenever
a
lion
was
accidentally
caught
in
a
trap
near
the
station
of
the
egyptian
government
this
man
would
regularly
present
himself
and
demand
the
release
of
the
noble
animal
the
favour
was
always
granted
and
planks
were
let
down
into
the
pit
to
enable
the
imprisoned
lion
to
clamber
up
and
escape
amongst
some
tribes
of
eastern
africa
when
a
lion
is
killed
the
carcase
is
brought
before
the
king
who
does
homage
to
it
by
prostrating
himself
on
the
ground
and
rubbing
his
face
on
the
muzzle
of
the
beast
in
some
parts
of
western
africa
if
a
negro
kills
a
leopard
he
is
bound
fast
and
brought
before
the
chiefs
for
having
killed
one
of
their
peers
the
man
defends
himself
on
the
plea
that
the
leopard
is
chief
of
the
forest
and
therefore
a
stranger
he
is
then
set
at
liberty
and
rewarded
but
the
dead
leopard
adorned
with
a
chief
s
bonnet
is
set
up
in
the
village
where
nightly
dances
are
held
in
its
honour
the
leopard
is
held
in
great
veneration
by
the
igaras
of
the
niger
they
call
it
father
though
they
do
not
object
to
kill
the
animal
in
the
chase
when
a
dead
leopard
is
brought
into
idah
the
capital
it
is
dressed
up
in
white
and
borne
on
the
heads
of
four
men
from
house
to
house
amidst
singing
and
beating
of
drums
each
householder
gives
a
present
of
cowries
or
cloth
to
the
owner
of
the
leopard
and
at
last
the
carcase
is
buried
with
great
ceremony
and
firing
of
guns
should
these
rites
be
neglected
the
people
imagine
that
the
spirit
of
the
dead
leopard
will
punish
them
among
the
ewe
negroes
of
togoland
hunters
who
had
killed
buffaloes
leopards
or
wild
black
swine
observed
in
agome
for
nine
days
the
same
or
very
similar
ceremonies
as
are
customary
at
the
death
of
a
woman
in
order
to
prevent
the
soul
of
the
slain
beasts
from
avenging
itself
on
them
a
custom
which
is
the
less
surprising
because
the
mourning
customs
themselves
are
based
on
the
fear
of
spirits
namely
the
spirits
of
the
dead
the
natives
ascribe
to
the
souls
of
these
dangerous
animals
the
power
of
killing
the
man
who
shot
them
or
of
so
blinding
and
enchanting
him
that
in
the
chase
he
confuses
animals
and
men
and
so
incurs
serious
the
quaint
ceremonies
which
these
negroes
observe
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
the
imaginary
perils
have
been
described
by
a
german
missionary
the
leopard
and
the
wild
buffalo
he
tells
us
are
believed
to
be
animated
by
malignant
souls
which
not
only
do
the
hunter
a
mischief
while
they
still
occupy
the
bodies
of
the
living
creatures
but
even
after
death
in
their
disembodied
state
continue
to
haunt
and
plague
their
slayer
sometimes
egging
on
a
serpent
or
a
leopard
to
sting
or
bite
him
sometimes
blinding
him
so
that
he
shoots
a
man
for
an
animal
or
can
not
find
his
way
home
and
goes
groping
about
in
the
wilderness
till
he
perishes
miserably
if
a
man
thus
blinded
and
crazed
should
make
his
way
back
to
the
town
he
is
banished
for
life
and
sold
into
slavery
his
house
and
plantation
are
razed
to
the
ground
and
his
nearest
relations
are
often
given
as
bail
into
the
hands
of
strangers
it
is
therefore
a
very
serious
matter
indeed
for
a
hunter
to
incur
the
wrath
of
a
leopard
s
ghost
and
it
is
quite
natural
that
he
should
take
all
reasonable
measures
to
guard
himself
against
so
threatening
a
calamity
hence
as
soon
as
he
has
killed
a
leopard
he
hurries
back
to
the
town
and
brings
word
of
it
to
the
other
men
who
have
slain
leopards
on
former
occasions
and
who
now
assist
him
with
their
advice
and
experience
the
first
thing
they
do
is
to
put
a
stalk
of
grass
in
his
mouth
as
a
sign
that
he
may
not
speak
then
they
repair
to
the
place
where
the
leopard
lies
dead
in
the
forest
and
inform
the
animal
of
the
reasons
why
he
has
been
shot
namely
because
he
has
stolen
sheep
fowls
and
pigs
and
has
killed
men
next
the
drums
are
beaten
and
the
people
assemble
in
the
open
square
of
the
town
the
dead
leopard
meanwhile
has
been
fastened
to
a
pole
and
with
his
eyes
bandaged
and
his
face
upturned
to
heaven
is
solemnly
carried
about
the
town
and
set
down
before
the
houses
of
the
principal
folk
who
reward
the
hero
and
his
comrades
with
presents
after
the
procession
has
gone
the
round
the
leopard
is
tied
to
a
tree
and
the
hunters
paint
the
slayer
with
red
and
white
so
as
to
make
him
look
like
a
leopard
except
that
the
leopard
s
spots
are
only
painted
on
the
left
side
of
his
body
a
basket
painted
in
the
same
colours
is
clapped
on
his
head
and
magical
strings
of
cowries
are
tied
round
his
hands
and
feet
thus
attired
he
and
the
other
heroes
who
have
killed
leopards
crawl
about
on
all
fours
and
roar
like
leopards
when
anybody
comes
near
them
in
his
left
hand
every
man
grasps
a
bow
for
the
slaughter
of
innocent
cocks
and
hens
and
with
his
right
he
grabbles
about
in
the
earth
like
an
animal
seeking
what
it
may
devour
none
of
them
may
speak
they
may
only
roar
but
they
do
that
in
a
masterly
manner
at
the
head
of
this
imposing
procession
go
two
men
armed
with
a
thick
cudgel
and
a
spear
respectively
and
the
rear
is
brought
up
by
a
third
man
who
is
privileged
to
walk
upright
on
his
hind
legs
this
favoured
person
is
the
cook
whose
office
it
is
to
dress
the
fowls
which
the
human
leopards
purloin
in
the
course
of
their
pilgrimage
indeed
for
nineteen
days
they
are
privileged
no
doubt
in
their
character
of
leopards
to
rob
the
with
impunity
in
the
afternoon
the
carcase
of
the
leopard
is
taken
down
skinned
and
cut
up
the
titbits
are
sent
to
the
chief
and
the
other
dignitaries
who
eat
them
and
the
remainder
of
the
flesh
is
consumed
by
the
common
folk
the
skin
the
teeth
the
head
and
the
claws
belong
to
the
hunter
who
killed
the
beast
but
for
nineteen
days
thereafter
the
slayer
of
the
leopard
must
retain
his
peculiar
costume
he
may
eat
only
animals
and
food
seasoned
with
salt
he
may
not
eat
anything
seasoned
with
pepper
and
on
no
account
may
he
taste
fish
because
they
are
creatures
a
general
feast
of
which
all
the
male
inhabitants
of
the
town
partake
winds
up
the
proceedings
at
the
close
of
the
nineteen
days
a
feature
of
the
festivities
is
a
dramatic
representation
of
a
which
is
carried
out
in
every
detail
amid
great
excitement
if
only
all
these
ceremonies
are
strictly
observed
the
hunter
need
have
no
fear
at
all
of
being
plagued
by
the
leopard
s
ghost
the
baganda
greatly
fear
the
ghosts
of
buffaloes
which
they
have
killed
and
they
always
appease
these
dangerous
spirits
on
no
account
will
they
bring
the
head
of
a
slain
buffalo
into
a
village
or
into
a
garden
of
plantains
they
always
eat
the
flesh
of
the
head
in
the
open
country
afterwards
they
place
the
skull
in
a
small
hut
built
for
the
purpose
where
they
pour
out
beer
as
an
offering
and
pray
to
the
ghost
to
stay
where
he
is
and
not
to
harm
them
oddly
enough
the
baganda
also
dread
the
ghosts
of
sheep
which
they
believe
would
haunt
and
kill
the
butcher
if
they
saw
him
give
the
fatal
stroke
hence
when
a
man
is
about
to
slaughter
a
sheep
he
gets
another
man
to
divert
its
attention
and
coming
up
behind
the
unsuspecting
animal
he
stuns
it
with
the
blow
of
an
then
before
it
can
recover
consciousness
he
adroitly
cuts
its
throat
in
this
way
the
ghost
of
the
sheep
is
bamboozled
and
will
not
haunt
the
butcher
moreover
when
a
sheep
dies
in
a
house
the
housewife
may
not
say
bluntly
to
her
husband
the
sheep
is
dead
or
its
ghost
touched
to
the
quick
would
certainly
make
her
fall
ill
and
might
even
kill
her
she
must
put
a
finer
point
on
the
painful
truth
by
saying
i
am
unable
to
untie
such
and
such
a
her
husband
understands
her
but
the
ghost
of
the
animal
does
not
or
at
all
events
he
does
not
resent
so
delicate
an
allusion
to
its
melancholy
decease
even
the
ghost
of
a
fowl
may
haunt
a
muganda
woman
and
make
her
ill
if
she
has
accidentally
killed
it
with
her
hoe
and
flung
away
the
body
in
the
long
grass
instead
of
carrying
it
to
her
husband

confessing
her
fault
another
formidable
beast

life
the
savage

takes
with
joy

with
fear
and
trembling
is
the
whale
after
the
slaughter
of
a
whale
the
maritime
koryak
of
siberia
hold
a
communal
festival
the
essential
part
of
which
is
based
on
the
conception
that
the
whale
killed
has
come
on
a
visit
to
the
village
that
it
is
staying
for
some
time
during
which
it
is
treated
with
great
respect
that
it
then
returns
to
the
sea
to
repeat
its
visit
the
following
year
that
it
will
induce
its
relatives
to
come
along
telling
them
of
the
hospitable
reception
that
has
been
accorded
to
it
according
to
the
koryak
ideas
the
whales
like
all
other
animals
constitute
one
tribe
or
rather
family
of
related
individuals
who
live
in
villages
like
the
koryak
they
avenge
the
murder
of
one
of
their
number
and
are
grateful
for
kindnesses
that
they
may
have
as
large
whales
are
now
rarely
seen
in
the
bays
of
the
okhotsk
sea
the
koryak
at
the
present
time
generally
celebrate
the
festival
for
a
white
whale
one
such
festival
was
witnessed
by
jochelson
at
the
village
of
kuel
in
october
a
white
whale
had
been
caught
in
the
nets
and
as
the
sea
was
partially
frozen
the
carcase
had
to
be
brought
ashore
in
a
sledge
when
it
was
seen
nearing
the
beach
a
number
of
women
arrayed
in
their
long
embroidered
went
forth
to
meet
and
welcome
it
carrying
lighted
in
their
hands
to
carry
burning
from
the
hearth
is
the
ancient
koryak
fashion
of
greeting
an
honoured
guest
strictly
speaking
the
women
who
go
forth
to
welcome
a
whale
to
the
house
should
wear
masks
of
on
their
faces
as
well
as
on
their
bodies
and
should
carry
sacrificial
alder
branches
as
well
as
firebrands
in
their
hands
but
on
the
present
occasion
the
women
dispensed
with
the
use
of
masks
they
danced
shaking
their
heads
moving
their
shoulders
and
swinging
their
whole
bodies
with
arms
outstretched
now
squatting
now
rising
and
singing
ah
a
guest
has
in
spite
of
the
cold
and
the
wind
the
sweat
dripped
from
them
so
violently
did
they
dance
and
they
sang
and
screamed
till
they
were
hoarse
when
the
sledge
with
its
burden
had
reached
the
shore
one
of
the
women
pronounced
an
incantation
over
the
whale
s
head
and
then
thrust
alder
branches
and
sacrificial
grass
into
its
mouth
next
they
muffled
its
head
in
a
hood
apparently
to
prevent
the
creature
from
witnessing
the
painful
spectacle
of
its
own
dissection
after
that
the
men
cut
up
the
carcase
and
the
women
collected
the
blood
in
pails
two
seals
which
had
also
been
killed
were
included
in
the
festivities
which
followed
the
heads
of
all
three
animals
were
cut
off
and
placed
on
the
roof
of
the
house
next
day
the
festival
began
in
the
morning
the
women
plaited
travelling
bags
of
grass
for
the
use
of
the
whale
and
made
grass
masks
in
the
evening
the
people
having
assembled
in
a
large
underground
house
some
boiled
pieces
of
the
white
whale
were
placed
in
a
grass
bag
and
set
before
a
wooden
image
of
a
white
whale
so
that
the
animal
or
its
departed
spirit
was
thus
apparently
supposed
to
be
regaled
with
portions
of
its
own
body
for
the
white
whale
and
the
seals
were
treated
as
honoured
guests
at
the
banquet
to
keep
up
the
pretence
the
people
were
silent
or
spoke
only
in
whispers
for
fear
of
wakening
the
guests
before
the
time
at
last
the
preparations
were
complete
fresh
faggots
piled
on
the
hearth
sent
up
a
blaze
illumining
with
an
unsteady
light
the
walls
of
the
vast
underground
dwelling
which
a
moment
before
had
been
shrouded
in
darkness
and
the
long
silence
was
broken
by
the
joyful
cries
of
the
women
here
dear
guests
have
come
visit
us
often
when
you
go
back
to
the
sea
tell
your
friends
to
call
on
us
also
we
will
prepare
just
as
nice
food
for
them
as
for
with
these
words
they
pointed
to
puddings
set
out
temptingly
on
the
boards
next
the
host
took
a
piece
of
the
fat
of
the
white
whale
and
threw
it
into
the
fire
saying
we
are
burning
it
in
the
fire
for
thee
then
he
went
to
the
domestic
shrine
placed
lumps
of
fat
before
the
rude
effigies
of
the
guardian
spirits
and
smeared
fat
on
their
mouths
the
appetites
of
the
higher
powers
having
thus
been
satisfied
the
people
set
to
and
partook
of
the
good
things
provided
for
them
including
the
flesh
of
the
white
whale
and
the
seals
lastly
two
old
men
practised
divination
by
means
of
the
of
a
seal
to
discover
whether
the
white
whale
would
go
back
to
the
sea
and
call
his
fellows
to
come
and
be
caught
like
himself
in
order
to
extract
this
information
from
the
bone
burning
coals
were
piled
on
it
and
the
resulting
cracks
were
carefully
scrutinised
to
the
delight
of
all
present
the
omens
proved
favourable
a
long
transverse
crack
indicated
the
sea
to
which
the
spirit
of
the
white
whale
would
soon
depart
four
days
later
the
departure
actually
took
place
it
was
a
bright
sunshiny
wintry
morning
the
frost
was
keen
and
for
more
than
a
mile
seaward
the
beach
was
covered
with
blocks
of
ice
in
the
great
underground
dwelling
where
the
feast
had
been
held
the
hearth
had
been
turned
into
something
like
an
altar
on
it
lay
the
heads
of
the
white
whale
and
the
seals
and
beside
them
of
grass
filled
with
puddings
which
the
souls
of
the
animals
were
to
take
with
them
on
their
long
journey
beside
the
hearth
knelt
two
women
their
faces
covered
with
grass
masks
and
their
heads
bent
over
the
bags
mumbling
an
incantation
the
sunlight
streamed
down
on
them
through
the
overhead
but
spread
only
a
dim
twilight
through
the
remoter
recesses
of
the
vast
subterranean
chamber
the
masks
worn
by
the
women
were
intended
to
guard
them
against
the
spirit
of
the
white
whale
which
was
supposed
to
be
hovering
invisible
in
the
air
the
incantation
over
the
women
rose
from
their
knees
and
doffed
their
masks
a
careful
examination
of
a
pudding
which
had
been
offered
in
sacrifice
to
the
white
whale
now
revealed
the
joyful
intelligence
that
the
spirit
of
the
whale
had
accepted
the
sacrifice
and
was
about
to
return
to
the
sea
all
that
remained
therefore
to
do
was
to
speed
him
on
his
way
for
that
purpose
two
men
ascended
the
roof
let
down
thongs
through
the
and
hauled
up
the
heads
of
the
white
whale
and
of
the
seals
together
with
the
of
provisions
that
concluded
the
despatch
of
the
souls
of
the
dead
animals
to
their
home
in
the
great
waters
when
the
inhabitants
of
the
isle
of
mary
to
the
north
of
madagascar
go
they
single
out
the
young
whales
for
attack
and
humbly
beg
the
mother
s
pardon
stating
the
necessity
that
drives
them
to
kill
her
progeny
and
requesting
that
she
will
be
pleased
to
go
below
while
the
deed
is
doing
that
her
maternal
feelings
may
not
be
outraged
by
witnessing
what
must
cause
her
so
much
an
ajumba
hunter
having
killed
a
female
hippopotamus
on
lake
azyingo
in
west
africa
the
animal
was
decapitated
and
its
quarters
and
bowels
removed
then
the
hunter
naked
stepped
into
the
hollow
of
the
ribs
and
kneeling
down
in
the
bloody
pool
washed
his
whole
body
with
the
blood
and
excretions
of
the
animal
while
he
prayed
to
the
soul
of
the
hippopotamus
not
to
bear
him
a
grudge
for
having
killed
her
and
so
blighted
her
hopes
of
future
maternity
and
he
further
entreated
the
ghost
not
to
stir
up
other
hippopotamuses
to
avenge
her
death
by
butting
at
and
capsizing
his
canoe
the
ounce
a
creature
is
dreaded
for
its
depredations
by
the
indians
of
brazil
when
they
have
caught
one
of
these
animals
in
a
snare
they
kill
it
and
carry
the
body
home
to
the
village
there
the
women
deck
the
carcase
with
feathers
of
many
colours
put
bracelets
on
its
legs
and
weep
over
it
saying
i
pray
thee
not
to
take
vengeance
on
our
little
ones
for
having
been
caught
and
killed
through
thine
own
ignorance
for
it
was
not
we
who
deceived
thee
it
was
thyself
our
husbands
only
set
the
trap
to
catch
animals
that
are
good
to
eat
they
never
thought
to
take
thee
in
it
therefore
let
not
thy
soul
counsel
thy
fellows
to
avenge
thy
death
on
our
little
ones
when
the
yuracares
indians
of
bolivia
have
killed
great
apes
in
their
tropical
forests
they
bring
the
bodies
home
set
them
out
in
a
row
on
palm
leaves
with
their
heads
all
looking
one
way
sprinkle
them
with
chicha
and
say
we
love
you
since
we
have
brought
you
they
imagine
that
the
performance
of
this
ceremony
is
very
gratifying
to
the
other
apes
in
the
woods
before
they
leave
a
temporary
camp
in
the
forest
where
they
have
killed
a
tapir
and
dried
the
meat
on
a
babracot
the
indians
of
guiana
invariably
destroy
this
babracot
saying
that
should
a
tapir
passing
that
way
find
traces
of
the
slaughter
of
one
of
his
kind
he
would
come
by
night
on
the
next
occasion
when
indians
slept
at
that
place
and
taking
a
man
would
babracot
him
in
revenge
when
a
blackfoot
indian
has
caught
eagles
in
a
trap
and
killed
them
he
takes
them
home
to
a
special
lodge
called
the
eagles
lodge
which
has
been
prepared
for
their
reception
outside
of
the
camp
here
he
sets
the
birds
in
a
row
on
the
ground
and
propping
up
their
heads
on
a
stick
puts
a
piece
of
dried
meat
in
each
of
their
mouths
in
order
that
the
spirits
of
the
dead
eagles
may
go
and
tell
the
other
eagles
how
well
they
are
being
treated
by
the
indians
so
when
indian
hunters
of
the
orinoco
region
have
killed
an
animal
they
open
its
mouth
and
pour
into
it
a
few
drops
of
the
liquor
they
generally
carry
with
them
in
order
that
the
soul
of
the
dead
beast
may
inform
its
fellows
of
the
welcome
it
has
met
with
and
that
they
too
cheered
by
the
prospect
of
the
same
kind
reception
may
come
with
alacrity
to
be
killed
a
cherokee
hunter
who
has
killed
an
eagle
stands
over
the
dead
bird
and
prays
it
not
to
avenge
itself
on
his
tribe
because
it
is
not
he
but
a
spaniard
who
has
done
the
cruel
deed
when
a
teton
indian
is
on
a
journey
and
he
meets
a
grey
spider
or
a
spider
with
yellow
legs
he
kills
it
because
some
evil
would
befall
him
if
he
did
not
but
he
is
very
careful
not
to
let
the
spider
know
that
he
kills
it
for
if
the
spider
knew
his
soul
would
go
and
tell
the
other
spiders
and
one
of
them
would
be
sure
to
avenge
the
death
of
his
relation
so
in
crushing
the
insect
the
indian
says
o
grandfather
spider
the
kill
and
the
spider
is
crushed
at
once
and
believes
what
is
told
him
his
soul
probably
runs
and
tells
the
other
spiders
that
the
have
killed
him
but
no
harm
comes
of
that
for
what
can
grey
or
spiders
do
to
the
but
it
is
not
merely
dangerous
creatures
with
whom
the
savage
desires
to
keep
on
good
terms
it
is
true
that
the
respect
which
he
pays
to
wild
beasts
is
in
some
measure
proportioned
to
their
strength
and
ferocity
thus
the
savage
stiens
of
cambodia
believing
that
all
animals
have
souls
which
roam
about
after
their
death
beg
an
animal
s
pardon
when
they
kill
it
lest
its
soul
should
come
and
torment
them
also
they
offer
it
sacrifices
but
these
sacrifices
are
proportioned
to
the
size
and
strength
of
the
animal
the
ceremonies
observed
at
the
death
of
an
elephant
are
conducted
with
much
pomp
and
last
seven
days
similar
distinctions
are
drawn
by
north
american
indians
the
bear
the
buffalo
and
the
beaver
are
manidos
divinities
which
furnish
food
the
bear
is
formidable
and
good
to
eat
they
render
ceremonies
to
him
begging
him
to
allow
himself
to
be
eaten
although
they
know
he
has
no
fancy
for
it
we
kill
you
but
you
are
not
annihilated
his
head
and
paws
are
objects
of
homage
other
animals
are
treated
similarly
from
similar
reasons
many
of
the
animal
manidos
not
being
dangerous
are
often
treated
with
terrapin
the
weasel
polecat
the
distinction
is
instructive
animals
which
are
feared
or
are
good
to
eat
or
both
are
treated
with
ceremonious
respect
those
which
are
neither
formidable
nor
good
to
eat
are
despised
we
have
had
examples
of
reverence
paid
to
animals
which
are
both
feared
and
eaten
it
remains
to
prove
that
similar
respect
is
shewn
to
animals
which
without
being
feared
are
either
eaten
or
valued
for
their
skins
when
siberian
have
caught
a
sable
no
one
is
allowed
to
see
it
and
they
think
that
if
good
or
evil
be
spoken
of
the
captured
sable
no
more
sables
will
be
caught
a
hunter
has
been
known
to
express
his
belief
that
the
sables
could
hear
what
was
said
of
them
as
far
off
as
moscow
he
said
that
the
chief
reason
why
the
sable
hunt
was
now
so
unproductive
was
that
some
live
sables
had
been
sent
to
moscow
there
they
had
been
viewed
with
astonishment
as
strange
animals
and
the
sables
can
not
abide
that
another
though
minor
cause
of
the
diminished
take
of
sables
was
he
alleged
that
the
world
is
now
much
worse
than
it
used
to
be
so
that
nowadays
a
hunter
will
sometimes
hide
the
sable
which
he
has
got
instead
of
putting
it
into
the
common
stock
this
also
said
he
the
sables
can
not
abide
a
russian
traveller
happening
once
to
enter
a
gilyak
hut
in
the
absence
of
the
owner
observed
a
freshly
killed
sable
hanging
on
the
wall
seeing
him
look
at
it
the
housewife
in
consternation
hastened
to
muffle
the
animal
in
a
fur
cap
after
which
it
was
taken
down
wrapt
in
birch
bark
and
put
away
out
of
sight
despite
the
high
price
he
offered
for
it
the
traveller
s
efforts
to
buy
the
animal
were
unavailing
it
was
bad
enough
they
told
him
that
he
a
stranger
had
seen
the
dead
sable
in
its
skin
but
far
worse
consequences
for
the
future
catch
of
sables
would
follow
if
they
were
to
sell
him
the
animal
entire
alaskan
hunters
preserve
the
bones
of
sables
and
beavers
out
of
reach
of
the
dogs
for
a
year
and
then
bury
them
carefully
lest
the
spirits
who
look
after
the
beavers
and
sables
should
consider
that
they
are
regarded
with
contempt
and
hence
no
more
should
be
killed
or
the
shuswap
indians
of
british
columbia
think
that
if
they
did
not
throw
into
the
river
the
beavers
would
not
go
into
the
traps
any
more
and
that
the
same
thing
would
happen
were
a
dog
to
eat
the
flesh
or
gnaw
the
bone
of
a
beaver
carrier
indians
who
have
trapped
martens
or
beavers
take
care
to
keep
them
from
the
dogs
for
if
a
dog
were
to
touch
these
animals
the
indians
believe
that
the
other
martens
or
beavers
would
not
suffer
themselves
to
be
caught
a
missionary
who
fell
in
with
an
old
carrier
indian
asked
him
what
luck
he
had
in
the
chase
oh
don
t
speak
to
me
about
it
replied
the
indian
there
are
beavers
in
plenty
i
caught
one
myself
immediately
after
my
arrival
here
but
unluckily
a
dog
got
hold
of
it
you
know
that
after
that
it
has
been
impossible
for
me
to
catch
nonsense
said
the
missionary
set
your
traps
as
if
nothing
had
happened
and
you
will
that
would
be
useless
answered
the
indian
in
a
tone
of
despair
quite
useless
you
don
t
know
the
ways
of
the
beaver
if
a
dog
merely
touches
a
beaver
all
the
other
beavers
are
angry
at
the
owner
of
the
dog
and
always
keep
away
from
his
it
was
in
vain
that
the
missionary
tried
to
laugh
or
argue
him
out
of
his
persuasion
the
man
persisted
in
abandoning
his
snares
and
giving
up
the
hunt
because
as
he
asserted
the
beavers
were
angry
with
him
a
french
traveller
observing
that
the
indians
of
louisiana
did
not
give
the
bones
of
beavers
and
otters
to
their
dogs
enquired
the
reason
they
told
him
there
was
a
spirit
in
the
woods
who
would
tell
the
other
beavers
and
otters
and
that
after
that
they
would
catch
no
more
animals
of
these
species
the
canadian
indians
were
equally
particular
not
to
let
their
dogs
gnaw
the
bones
or
at
least
certain
of
the
bones
of
beavers
they
took
the
greatest
pains
to
collect
and
preserve
these
bones
and
when
the
beaver
had
been
caught
in
a
net
they
threw
them
into
the
river
to
a
jesuit
who
argued
that
the
beavers
could
not
possibly
know
what
became
of
their
bones
the
indians
replied
you
know
nothing
about
catching
beavers
and
yet
you
will
be
prating
about
it
before
the
beaver
is
stone
dead
his
soul
takes
a
turn
in
the
hut
of
the
man
who
is
killing
him
and
makes
a
careful
note
of
what
is
done
with
his
bones
if
the
bones
are
given
to
the
dogs
the
other
beavers
would
get
word
of
it
and
would
not
let
themselves
be
caught
whereas
if
their
bones
are
thrown
into
the
fire
or
a
river
they
are
quite
satisfied
and
it
is
particularly
gratifying
to
the
net
which
caught
before
hunting
the
beaver
they
offered
a
solemn
prayer
to
the
great
beaver
and
presented
him
with
tobacco
and
when
the
chase
was
over
an
orator
pronounced
a
funeral
oration
over
the
dead
beavers
he
praised
their
spirit
and
wisdom
you
will
hear
no
more
said
he
the
voice
of
the
chieftains
who
commanded
you
and
whom
you
chose
from
among
all
the
warrior
beavers
to
give
you
laws
your
language
which
the
understand
perfectly
will
be
heard
no
more
at
the
bottom
of
the
lake
you
will
fight
no
more
battles
with
the
otters
your
cruel
foes
no
beavers
but
your
skins
shall
serve
to
buy
arms
we
will
carry
your
smoked
hams
to
our
children
we
will
keep
the
dogs
from
eating
your
bones
which
are
so
the
elan
deer
and
elk
were
treated
by
the
american
indians
with
the
same
punctilious
respect
and
for
the
same
reason
their
bones
might
not
be
given
to
the
dogs
nor
thrown
into
the
fire
nor
might
their
fat
be
dropped
upon
the
fire
because
the
souls
of
the
dead
animals
were
believed
to
see
what
was
done
to
their
bodies
and
to
tell
it
to
the
other
beasts
living
and
dead
hence
if
their
bodies
were
the
animals
of
that
species
would
not
allow
themselves
to
be
taken
neither
in
this
world
nor
in
the
world
to
come
the
houses
of
the
indians
of
honduras
were
encumbered
with
the
bones
of
deer
the
indians
believing
that
if
they
threw
the
bones
away
the
other
deer
could
not
be
taken
among
the
chiquites
of
paraguay
a
sick
man
would
be
asked
by
the
whether
he
had
not
thrown
away
some
of
the
flesh
of
the
deer
or
turtle
and
if
he
answered
yes
the
would
say
that
is
what
is
killing
you
the
soul
of
the
deer
or
turtle
has
entered
into
your
body
to
avenge
the
wrong
you
did
before
the
tzentales
of
southern
mexico
and
the
kekchis
of
guatemala
venture
to
skin
a
deer
which
they
have
killed
they
lift
up
its
head
and
burn
copal
before
it
as
an
offering
otherwise
a
certain
being
named
tzultacca
would
be
angry
and
send
them
no
more
game
cherokee
hunters
ask
pardon
of
the
deer
they
kill
if
they
failed
to
do
so
they
think
that
the
little
deer
the
chief
of
the
deer
tribe
who
can
never
die
or
be
wounded
would
track
the
hunter
to
his
home
by
the
on
the
ground
and
would
put
the
spirit
of
rheumatism
into
him
sometimes
the
hunter
on
starting
for
home
lights
a
fire
in
the
trail
behind
him
to
prevent
the
little
deer
from
pursuing
him
before
they
went
out
to
hunt
for
deer
antelope
or
elk
the
apaches
used
to
resort
to
sacred
caves
where
the
propitiated
with
prayer
and
sacrifice
the
animal
gods
whose
progeny
they
intended
to
destroy
the
indians
of
louisiana
bewailed
bitterly
the
death
of
the
buffaloes
which
they
were
about
to
kill
more
than
two
hundred
of
them
at
a
time
have
been
seen
shedding
crocodile
tears
over
the
approaching
slaughter
of
the
animals
while
they
marched
in
solemn
procession
headed
by
an
old
man
who
waved
a
at
the
end
of
a
stick
as
an
oriflamme
and
by
a
woman
who
strutted
proudly
along
bearing
on
her
back
a
large
kettle
which
had
been
recently
abstracted
from
the
baggage
of
some
french
explorers
the
thompson
indians
of
british
columbia
cherished
many
superstitious
beliefs
and
observed
many
superstitious
practices
in
regard
to
deer
when
a
deer
was
killed
they
said
that
the
rest
of
the
deer
would
be
well
pleased
if
the
hunters
butchered
the
animal
nicely
and
cleanly
to
waste
venison
displeased
the
animals
who
after
that
would
not
allow
themselves
to
be
shot
by
the
hunter
if
a
hunter
was
overburdened
and
had
to
leave
some
of
the
venison
behind
the
other
deer
were
better
pleased
if
he
hung
it
up
on
a
tree
than
if
he
let
it
lie
on
the
ground
the
guts
were
gathered
and
put
where
the
blood
had
been
spilt
in
butchering
the
beast
and
the
whole
was
covered
up
with
a
few
in
laying
the
boughs
on
the
blood
and
guts
the
man
told
the
deer
not
to
grieve
for
the
death
of
their
friend
and
not
to
take
it
ill
that
he
had
left
some
of
the
body
behind
for
he
had
done
his
best
to
cover
it
if
he
did
not
cover
it
they
thought
the
deer
would
be
sorry
or
angry
and
would
spoil
his
luck
in
the
chase
when
the
head
of
a
deer
had
to
be
left
behind
they
commonly
placed
it
on
the
branch
of
a
tree
that
it
might
not
be
contaminated
by
dogs
and
women
for
the
same
reason
they
burned
the
bones
of
the
slain
deer
lest
they
should
be
touched
by
women
or
gnawed
by
dogs
and
venison
was
never
brought
into
a
hut
by
the
common
door
because
that
door
was
used
by
women
it
was
taken
in
through
a
hole
made
in
the
back
of
the
hut
no
hunter
would
give
a
deer
s
head
to
a
man
who
was
the
first
or
second
of
a
family
for
that
would
make
the
rest
of
the
deer
very
shy
and
hard
to
shoot
and
in
telling
his
friends
of
his
bag
he
would
generally
call
a
buck
a
doe
and
a
doe
he
would
call
a
fawn
and
a
fawn
he
would
call
a
hare
this
he
did
that
he
might
not
seem
to
the
deer
to
brag
the
lillooet
indians
of
british
columbia
threw
the
bones
of
animals
particularly
those
of
the
deer
and
the
beaver
into
the
water
in
order
that
the
dogs
should
not
defile
or
eat
them
and
thereby
offend
the
animals
when
the
hunter
committed
the
bones
to
the
water
he
generally
prayed
to
the
dead
animal
saying
see
i
treat
you
respectfully
nothing
shall
defile
you
have
pity
on
me
so
i
may
kill
more
of
you
may
i
be
successful
in
hunting
and
trapping
the
canadian
indians
would
not
eat
the
embryos
of
the
elk
unless
at
the
close
of
the
hunting
season
otherwise
the
would
be
shy
and
refuse
to
be
caught
indians
of
the
lower
fraser
river
regard
the
porcupine
as
their
elder
brother
hence
when
a
hunter
kills
one
of
these
creatures
he
asks
his
elder
brother
s
pardon
and
does
not
eat
of
the
flesh
till
the
next
day
the
sioux
will
not
stick
an
awl
or
needle
into
a
turtle
for
they
are
sure
that
if
they
were
to
do
so
the
turtle
would
punish
them
at
some
future
time
some
of
the
north
american
indians
believed
that
each
sort
of
animal
had
its
patron
or
genius
who
watched
over
and
preserved
it
an
indian
girl
having
once
picked
up
a
dead
mouse
her
father
snatched
the
little
creature
from
her
and
tenderly
caressed
and
fondled
it
being
asked
why
he
did
so
he
said
that
it
was
to
appease
the
genius
of
mice
in
order
that
he
might
not
torment
his
daughter
for
eating
the
mouse
with
that
he
handed
the
mouse
to
the
girl
and
she
ate
it
when
the
koryak
have
killed
a
fox
they
take
the
body
home
and
lay
it
down
near
the
fire
saying
let
the
guest
warm
himself
when
he
feels
warm
we
will
free
him
from
his
so
when
the
frozen
carcase
is
thawed
they
skin
it
and
wrap
long
strips
of
grass
round
about
it
then
the
animal
s
mouth
is
filled
with
and
the
mistress
of
the
house
gashes
the
flesh
and
puts
more
roe
or
dried
meat
into
the
gashes
making
believe
that
the
gashes
are
the
fox
s
pockets
which
she
thus
fills
with
provisions
then
the
carcase
is
carried
out
of
the
house
and
the
people
say
go
and
tell
your
friends
that
it
is
good
to
visit
yonder
house
instead
of
my
old
coat
they
gave
me
a
new
one
still
warmer
and
with
longer
hair
i
have
eaten
my
fill
and
had
my
pockets
well
stored
you
too
go
and
visit
the
natives
think
that
if
they
neglected
to
observe
this
ceremonial
they
would
have
no
luck
in
hunting
foxes
when
a
ewe
hunter
of
togoland
has
killed
an
antelope
of
a
particular
kind
he
erects
an
enclosure
of
branches
within
which
he
places
the
lower
jawbones
of
all
the
animals
he
has
shot
then
he
pours
and
sprinkles
meal
on
the
bones
saying
ye
lower
jawbones
of
beasts
ye
are
now
come
home
here
is
food
here
is
drink
therefore
lead
your
comrades
that
is
the
living
beasts
of
the
forest
hither
in
the
islands
of
the
indian
archipelago
the
skulls
of
all
the
turtles
which
a
fisherman
has
caught
are
hung
up
under
his
house
before
he
goes
out
to
catch
another
he
addresses
himself
to
the
skull
of
the
last
turtle
that
he
killed
and
having
inserted
betel
between
its
jaws
he
prays
the
spirit
of
the
dead
animal
to
entice
its
kinsfolk
in
the
sea
to
come
and
be
caught
in
the
poso
district
of
central
celebes
hunters
keep
the
jawbones
of
deer
and
wild
pigs
which
they
have
killed
and
hang
them
up
in
their
houses
near
the
fire
then
they
say
to
the
jawbones
ye
cry
after
your
comrades
that
your
grandfathers
or
nephews
or
children
may
not
go
their
notion
is
that
the
souls
of
the
dead
deer
and
pigs
tarry
near
their
jawbones
and
attract
the
souls
of
living
deer
and
pigs
which
are
thus
drawn
into
the
toils
of
the
hunter
thus
in
all
these
cases
the
wily
savage
employs
dead
animals
as
decoys
to
lure
living
animals
to
their
doom
the
lengua
indians
of
the
gran
chaco
love
to
hunt
the
ostrich
but
when
they
have
killed
one
of
these
birds
and
are
bringing
home
the
carcase
to
the
village
they
take
steps
to
outwit
the
resentful
ghost
of
their
victim
they
think
that
when
the
first
natural
shock
of
death
is
passed
the
ghost
of
the
ostrich
pulls
himself
together
and
makes
after
his
body
acting
on
this
sage
calculation
the
indians
pluck
feathers
from
the
breast
of
the
bird
and
strew
them
at
intervals
along
the
track
at
every
bunch
of
feathers
the
ghost
stops
to
consider
is
this
the
whole
of
my
body
or
only
a
part
of
it
the
doubt
gives
him
pause
and
when
at
last
he
has
made
up
his
mind
fully
at
all
the
bunches
and
has
further
wasted
valuable
time
by
the
zigzag
course
which
he
invariably
pursues
in
going
from
one
to
another
the
hunters
are
safe
at
home
and
the
bilked
ghost
may
stalk
in
vain
round
about
the
village
which
he
is
too
timid
to
enter
the
esquimaux
of
the
hudson
bay
region
believe
that
the
reindeer
are
controlled
by
a
great
spirit
who
resides
in
a
large
cave
near
the
end
of
cape
chidley
the
outward
form
of
the
spirit
is
that
of
a
huge
white
bear
he
obtains
and
controls
the
spirit
of
every
reindeer
that
is
slain
or
dies
and
it
depends
on
his
good
will
whether
the
people
shall
have
a
supply
of
reindeer
or
not
the
sorcerer
intercedes
with
this
great
spirit
and
prevails
on
him
to
send
the
deer
to
the
hungry
esquimaux
he
informs
the
spirit
that
the
people
have
in
no
way
offended
him
since
he
the
sorcerer
has
taken
great
care
that
the
whole
of
the
meat
was
eaten
up
and
that
last
spring
when
the
does
were
returning
to
him
to
drop
their
young
none
of
the
little
or
embryo
fawns
were
devoured
by
the
dogs
after
long
incantations
the
magician
announces
that
the
patron
of
the
deer
condescends
to
supply
the
esquimaux
with
the
spirits
of
the
animals
in
a
material
form
and
that
soon
there
will
be
plenty
in
the
land
he
charges
the
people
to
fall
on
and
slay
and
thereby
win
the
approval
of
the
spirit
who
loves
to
see
good
folk
enjoying
themselves
knowing
that
so
long
as
the
esquimaux
refrain
from
feeding
their
dogs
with
the
unborn
young
the
spirits
of
the
dead
reindeer
will
return
again
to
his
watchful
care
the
dogs
are
not
allowed
to
taste
the
flesh
and
until
the
supply
is
plentiful
they
may
not
gnaw
the
lest
the
guardian
of
the
deer
should
take
offence
and
send
no
more
of
the
animals
if
unfortunately
a
dog
should
get
at
the
meat
a
piece
of
his
tail
is
cut
off
or
his
ear
is
cropped
to
let
the
blood
flow
again
the
central
esquimaux
hold
that
particularly
whales
and
common
seals
sprang
from
the
severed
fingers
of
the
goddess
sedna
and
that
therefore
an
esquimau
must
make
atonement
for
every
such
animal
that
he
kills
when
a
seal
is
brought
into
the
hut
the
woman
must
stop
working
till
it
has
been
cut
up
after
the
capture
of
a
ground
seal
walrus
or
whale
they
must
rest
for
three
days
not
all
sorts
of
work
however
are
forbidden
for
they
may
mend
articles
made
of
sealskin
but
they
may
not
make
anything
new
for
example
an
old
tent
cover
may
be
enlarged
in
order
to
build
a
larger
hut
but
it
is
not
allowed
to
make
a
new
one
working
on
new
deerskins
is
strictly
forbidden
no
skins
of
this
kind
obtained
in
summer
may
be
prepared
before
the
ice
has
formed
and
the
first
seal
has
been
caught
with
the
harpoon
later
on
as
soon
as
the
first
walrus
has
been
taken
the
work
must
again
stop
until
autumn
comes
round
hence
all
families
are
eager
to
finish
the
work
on
deerskins
as
fast
as
possible
for
until
that
is
done
the
walrus
season
may
not
begin
the
greenlanders
are
careful
not
to
fracture
the
heads
of
seals
or
throw
them
into
the
sea
but
pile
them
in
a
heap
before
the
door
that
the
souls
of
the
seals
may
not
be
enraged
and
scare
their
brethren
from
the
coast
the
esquimaux
about
bering
strait
believe
that
the
souls
of
dead
such
as
seals
walrus
and
whales
remain
attached
to
their
bladders
and
that
by
returning
the
bladders
to
the
sea
they
can
cause
the
souls
to
be
reincarnated
in
fresh
bodies
and
so
multiply
the
game
which
the
hunters
pursue
and
kill
acting
on
this
belief
every
hunter
carefully
removes
and
preserves
the
bladders
of
all
the
that
he
kills
and
at
a
solemn
festival
held
once
a
year
in
winter
these
bladders
containing
the
souls
of
all
the
that
have
been
killed
throughout
the
year
are
honoured
with
dances
and
offerings
of
food
in
the
public
after
which
they
are
taken
out
on
the
ice
and
thrust
through
holes
into
the
water
for
the
simple
esquimaux
imagine
that
the
souls
of
the
animals
in
high
good
humour
at
the
kind
treatment
they
have
experienced
will
thereafter
be
born
again
as
seals
walrus
and
whales
and
in
that
form
will
flock
willingly
to
be
again
speared
harpooned
or
otherwise
done
to
death
by
the
hunters
the
ceremonies
observed
at
these
annual
festivals
of
reincarnation
are
elaborate
the
or
or
in
which
the
festival
is
held
consists
of
a
spacious
chamber
entered
by
a
tunnel
which
leads
down
to
a
large
round
cellar
under
the
floor
of
the
house
from
the
cellar
you
ascend
into
the
through
a
hole
in
the
floor
wooden
benches
run
round
the
apartment
which
is
lit
by
lamps
an
opening
in
the
roof
serves
at
once
as
a
window
and
a
chimney
unmarried
men
sleep
in
the
at
all
times
they
have
no
other
home
the
festival
is
commonly
held
in
december
but
it
may
fall
as
late
as
january
it
lasts
several
days
when
the
time
is
come
to
celebrate
it
each
hunter
brings
into
the
the
inflated
bladders
of
all
the
seals
walrus
and
whales
that
he
has
killed
during
the
year
these
are
tied
by
the
necks
in
bunches
and
hung
up
on
seal
spears
which
are
stuck
in
a
row
in
the
wall
some
six
or
eight
feet
above
the
floor
here
food
and
water
are
offered
to
them
or
rather
to
the
spirits
of
the
animals
which
are
supposed
to
be
present
in
the
bladders
and
the
spirits
signify
their
acceptance
of
the
offering
by
causing
the
bladders
to
swing
to
and
fro
a
movement
which
is
really
produced
by
a
man
sitting
in
a
dark
corner
who
pulls
a
string
attached
to
the
bladders
further
the
bladders
are
fumigated
with
torches
of
wild
parsnip
stalks
the
aromatic
smoke
and
red
flames
of
which
are
believed
to
be
to
the
souls
of
the
animals
dangling
in
the
bladders
moreover
to
amuse
the
souls
men
execute
curious
dances
before
them
to
the
music
of
drums
first
the
dancers
move
slowly
with
a
jerky
action
from
side
to
side
then
they
gallop
obliquely
with
arms
tossed
up
and
down
and
lastly
they
hop
and
jump
always
keeping
perfect
time
to
the
beat
of
the
drums
the
dance
is
supposed
to
imitate
the
movements
of
seals
and
walrus
and
again
the
spirits
signify
their
pleasure
by
making
the
bladders
swing
backwards
and
forwards
during
the
continuance
of
the
festival
no
loud
noises
may
be
made
in
the
for
fear
of
alarming
the
souls
of
the
animals
in
the
bladders
if
any
person
makes
a
noise
by
accident
all
the
men
present
raise
a
chorus
of
cries
in
imitation
of
the
notes
of
the
eider
duck
to
let
the
souls
of
the
animals
think
that
the
unseemly
disturbance
proceeds
from
the
birds
and
not
from
the
people
further
so
long
as
the
festival
lasts
no
wood
may
be
cut
with
an
iron
axe
in
the
village
the
men
must
keep
rigidly
apart
from
the
women
and
no
female
above
the
age
of
puberty
may
come
near
the
bladders
suspended
in
the
the
reason
assigned
being
that
such
women
are
unclean
and
might
offend
the
sensitive
souls
of
the
in
the
bladders
but
immature
girls
being
untainted
by
the
pollution
which
attaches
to
adult
women
may
go
about
the
bladders
freely
the
last
and
crowning
scene
of
the
festival
takes
place
at
night
or
just
at
sunrise
the
spears
with
the
bladders
attached
to
them
are
passed
out
by
the
shaman
into
the
open
air
through
the
in
the
roof
when
all
are
outside
a
huge
torch
of
wild
parsnip
stalks
is
lighted
the
chief
shaman
takes
it
on
his
shoulder
and
runs
with
it
as
fast
as
he
can
across
the
snow
and
out
on
the
ice
behind
him
troop
all
the
men
carrying
each
his
spear
with
the
bladders
of
the
dangling
and
flapping
from
it
and
in
the
rear
race
the
women
children
and
old
men
howling
screaming
and
making
a
great
uproar
in
the
darkness
the
lurid
flame
of
the
torch
shoots
high
into
the
air
casting
a
red
glare
over
the
snowy
landscape
and
lighting
up
the
swarm
of
fantastic
figures
that
stream
along
in
wild
excitement
arrived
at
a
hole
which
had
been
cut
on
purpose
in
the
the
shaman
plants
his
burning
torch
beside
it
in
the
snow
and
every
man
as
he
comes
up
rips
open
his
bladders
and
thrusts
them
one
after
the
other
into
the
water
under
the
ice
this
ends
the
ceremony
the
souls
of
the
dead
seals
walrus
and
whales
are
now
ready
to
be
born
again
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
so
all
the
people
return
contented
to
the
village
at
michael
the
men
who
have
thrust
the
bladders
under
the
ice
are
obliged
on
their
return
to
leap
through
a
fire
of
wild
parsnip
stalks
probably
as
a
mode
of
ceremonial
purification
for
after
the
dance
and
the
offering
of
food
at
the
festival
the
chief
shaman
passes
a
lighted
torch
of
parsnip
stalks
round
the
and
the
dancers
for
the
express
purpose
of
purifying
them
and
averting
any
evil
influence
that
might
bring
sickness
or
ill
luck
on
the
hunters
for
like
reasons
a
tribe
which
depends
for
its
subsistence
chiefly
or
in
part
upon
fishing
is
careful
to
treat
the
fish
with
every
mark
of
honour
and
respect
the
indians
of
peru
worshipped
the
whale
for
its
monstrous
greatness
besides
this
ordinary
system
of
worship
which
prevailed
throughout
the
coast
the
people
of
different
provinces
adored
the
fish
that
they
caught
in
greatest
abundance
for
they
said
that
the
first
fish
that
was
made
in
the
world
above
for
so
they
named
heaven
gave
birth
to
all
other
fish
of
that
species
and
took
care
to
send
them
plenty
of
its
children
to
sustain
their
tribe
for
this
reason
they
worshipped
sardines
in
one
region
where
they
killed
more
of
them
than
of
any
other
fish
in
others
the
skate
in
others
the
dogfish
in
others
the
golden
fish
for
its
beauty
in
others
the
crawfish
in
others
for
want
of
larger
gods
the
crabs
where
they
had
no
other
fish
or
where
they
knew
not
how
to
catch
and
kill
them
in
short
they
had
whatever
fish
was
most
serviceable
to
them
as
their
the
kwakiutl
indians
of
british
columbia
think
that
when
a
salmon
is
killed
its
soul
returns
to
the
salmon
country
hence
they
take
care
to
throw
the
bones
and
offal
into
the
sea
in
order
that
the
soul
may
reanimate
them
at
the
resurrection
of
the
salmon
whereas
if
they
burned
the
bones
the
soul
would
be
lost
and
so
it
would
be
quite
impossible
for
that
salmon
to
rise
from
the
dead
in
like
manner
the
otawa
indians
of
canada
believing
that
the
souls
of
dead
fish
passed
into
other
bodies
of
fish
never
burned
fish
bones
for
fear
of
displeasing
the
souls
of
the
fish
who
would
come
no
more
to
the
nets
the
hurons
also
refrained
from
throwing
fish
bones
into
the
fire
lest
the
souls
of
the
fish
should
go
and
warn
the
other
fish
not
to
let
themselves
be
caught
since
the
hurons
would
burn
their
bones
moreover
they
had
men
who
preached
to
the
fish
and
persuaded
them
to
come
and
be
caught
a
good
preacher
was
much
sought
after
for
they
thought
that
the
exhortations
of
a
clever
man
had
a
great
effect
in
drawing
the
fish
to
the
nets
in
the
huron
fishing
village
where
the
french
missionary
sagard
stayed
the
preacher
to
the
fish
prided
himself
very
much
on
his
eloquence
which
was
of
a
florid
order
every
evening
after
supper
having
seen
that
all
the
people
were
in
their
places
and
that
a
strict
silence
was
observed
he
preached
to
the
fish
his
text
was
that
the
hurons
did
not
burn
fish
bones
then
enlarging
on
this
theme
with
extraordinary
unction
he
exhorted
and
conjured
and
invited
and
implored
the
fish
to
come
and
be
caught
and
to
be
of
good
courage
and
to
fear
nothing
for
it
was
all
to
serve
their
friends
who
honoured
them
and
did
not
burn
their
at
bogadjim
in
german
new
guinea
an
enchanter
is
employed
to
lure
the
fish
to
their
doom
he
stands
in
a
canoe
on
the
beach
with
a
decorated
beside
him
and
commands
the
fish
to
come
from
all
quarters
to
bogadjim
when
the
aino
have
killed
a
they
thank
the
fish
for
allowing
himself
to
be
caught
and
invite
him
to
come
again
among
the
nootka
indians
of
british
columbia
it
was
formerly
a
rule
that
any
person
who
had
partaken
of
bear
s
flesh
must
rigidly
abstain
from
eating
any
kind
of
fish
for
a
term
of
two
months
the
motive
for
the
abstinence
was
not
any
consideration
for
the
health
of
the
eater
but
a
superstitious
belief
that
should
any
of
their
people
after
tasting
bear
s
flesh
eat
of
fresh
salmon
cod
the
fish
though
at
ever
so
great
a
distance
off
would
come
to
the
knowledge
of
it
and
be
so
much
offended
thereat
as
not
to
allow
themselves
to
be
taken
by
any
of
the
the
disappearance
of
herring
from
the
sea
about
heligoland
in
was
attributed
by
the
fishermen
to
the
misconduct
of
two
lads
who
had
whipped
a
herring
and
then
flung
it
back
into
the
sea
a
similar
disappearance
of
the
herrings
from
the
moray
firth
in
the
reign
of
queen
anne
was
set
down
by
some
people
to
a
breach
of
the
sabbath
which
had
been
committed
by
the
fishermen
while
others
opined
that
it
was
due
to
a
quarrel
in
which
blood
had
been
spilt
in
the
sea
for
scotch
fishermen
are
persuaded
that
if
blood
be
drawn
in
a
quarrel
on
the
coast
where
herring
are
being
caught
the
shoal
will
at
once
take
its
departure
and
not
return
for
that
season
at
least
west
highland
fishermen
believe
that
every
shoal
of
herring
has
its
leader
which
it
follows
wherever
he
goes
this
leader
is
twice
as
big
as
an
ordinary
herring
and
the
fishermen
call
it
the
king
of
herring
when
they
chance
to
catch
it
in
their
nets
they
put
it
back
carefully
into
the
sea
for
they
would
esteem
it
petty
treason
to
destroy
the
royal
fish
the
natives
of
the
duke
of
york
island
annually
decorate
a
canoe
with
flowers
and
ferns
lade
it
or
are
supposed
to
lade
it
with
and
set
it
adrift
to
compensate
the
fish
for
their
fellows
who
have
been
caught
and
eaten
when
the
tarahumares
of
mexico
are
preparing
to
poison
the
waters
of
a
river
for
the
purpose
of
stupefying
and
catching
the
fish
they
take
the
precaution
of
first
making
offerings
to
the
master
of
the
fish
by
way
of
payment
for
the
fish
of
which
they
are
about
to
bereave
him
the
offerings
consist
of
axes
hats
blankets
girdles
pouches
and
especially
knives
and
strings
of
beads
which
are
hung
to
a
cross
or
a
horizontal
bar
set
up
in
the
middle
of
the
river
however
the
master
of
the
fish
who
is
thought
to
be
the
oldest
fish
does
not
long
enjoy
these
good
things
for
next
morning
the
owners
of
the
various
articles
remove
them
from
the
river
and
appropriate
them
to
their
usual
secular
purposes
it
is
especially
necessary
to
treat
the
first
fish
caught
with
consideration
in
order
to
conciliate
the
rest
of
the
fish
whose
conduct
may
be
supposed
to
be
influenced
by
the
reception
given
to
those
of
their
kind
which
were
the
first
to
be
taken
accordingly
the
maoris
always
put
back
into
the
sea
the
first
fish
caught
with
a
prayer
that
it
may
tempt
other
fish
to
come
and
be
among
the
baganda
the
first
fish
taken
were
treated
ceremonially
some
the
fisherman
took
to
the
god
mukasa
the
remainder
his
wife
cooked
and
he
and
she
both
partook
of
them
and
he
afterwards
jumped
over
still
more
stringent
are
the
precautions
taken
when
the
fish
are
the
first
of
the
season
on
salmon
rivers
when
the
fish
begin
to
run
up
the
stream
in
spring
they
are
received
with
much
deference
by
tribes
who
like
the
indians
of
the
pacific
coast
of
north
america
subsist
largely
upon
a
fish
diet
to
some
of
these
tribes
the
salmon
is
what
corn
is
to
the
european
rice
to
the
chinese
and
seals
to
the
esquimaux
plenty
of
salmon
means
abundance
in
the
camp
and
joy
at
the
domestic
hearth
failure
of
the
salmon
for
a
single
season
means
famine
and
desolation
silence
in
the
village
and
sad
hearts
about
the
fire
accordingly
in
british
columbia
the
indians
used
to
go
out
to
meet
the
first
fish
as
they
came
up
the
river
they
paid
court
to
them
and
would
address
them
thus
you
fish
you
fish
you
are
all
chiefs
you
are
you
are
all
amongst
the
thlinkeet
or
tlingit
of
alaska
the
first
halibut
of
the
season
is
carefully
handled
and
addressed
as
a
chief
and
a
festival
is
given
in
his
honour
after
which
the
fishing
goes
on
among
the
tribes
of
the
lower
fraser
river
when
the
first
of
the
season
has
been
caught
the
fisherman
carries
it
to
the
chief
of
his
tribe
who
delivers
it
to
his
wife
she
prays
saying
to
the
salmon
who
has
brought
you
here
to
make
us
happy
we
are
thankful
to
your
chief
for
sending
when
she
has
cut
and
roasted
the
salmon
according
to
certain
prescribed
rules
the
whole
tribe
is
invited
and
partakes
of
the
fish
after
they
have
purified
themselves
by
drinking
a
decoction
of
certain
plants
which
is
regarded
as
a
medicine
for
cleansing
the
people
but
widowers
widows
menstruous
women
and
youths
may
not
eat
of
this
particular
salmon
even
later
when
the
fish
have
become
plentiful
and
these
ceremonies
are
dispensed
with
the
same
classes
of
persons
are
not
allowed
to
eat
fresh
salmon
though
they
may
partake
of
the
dried
fish
the
must
always
be
looked
after
carefully
its
bones
have
to
be
thrown
into
the
river
after
which
the
fish
will
revive
and
return
to
its
chief
in
the
west
whereas
if
the
fish
are
not
treated
with
consideration
they
will
take
their
revenge
and
the
careless
fisherman
will
be

begin

up

dance
for

to

one
of
the
indians
called

kareya
or
retires
to

and
fasts
for
ten

on

return
the
people
flee
while
he
goes
to
the
river
takes
the

salmon
of
the
catch
eats
some
of
it
and
with
the
rest
kindles
the
sacred
fire
in
the
no
indian
may
take
a
salmon
before
this
dance
is
held
nor
for
ten
days
after
it
even
if
his
family
are
the
karoks
also
believe
that
a
fisherman
will
take
no
salmon
if
the
poles
of
which
his
is
made
were
gathered
on
the
where
the
salmon
might
have
seen
them
the
poles
must
be
brought
from
the
top
of
the
highest
mountain
the
fisherman
will
also
labour
in
vain
if
he
uses
the
same
poles
a
second
year
in
booths
or
weirs
because
the
old
salmon
will
have
told
the
young
ones
about
among
the
indians
of
the
columbia
river
when
the
salmon
make
their
first
appearance
in
the
river
they
are
never
allowed
to
be
cut
crosswise
nor
boiled
but
roasted
nor
are
they
allowed
to
be
sold
without
the
heart
being
first
taken
out
nor
to
be
kept
over
night
but
must
be
all
consumed
or
eaten
the
day
they
are
taken
out
of
the
water
all
these
rules
are
observed
for
about
ten
they
think
that
if
the
heart
of
a
fish
were
eaten
by
a
stranger
at
the
beginning
of
the
season
they
would
catch
no
more
fish
hence
they
roast
and
eat
the
hearts
themselves
there
is
a
favourite
fish
of
the
aino
which
appears
in
their
rivers
about
may
and
june
they
prepare
for
the
fishing
by
observing
rules
of
ceremonial
purity
and
when
they
have
gone
out
to
fish
the
women
at
home
must
keep
strict
silence
or
the
fish
would
hear
them
and
disappear
when
the
first
fish
is
caught
he
is
brought
home
and
passed
through
a
small
opening
at
the
end
of
the
hut
but
not
through
the
door
for
if
he
were
passed
through
the
door
the
other
fish
would
certainly
see
him
and
this
may
partly
explain
the
custom
observed
by
other
savages
of
bringing
game
in
certain
cases
into
their
huts
not
by
the
door
but
by
the
window
the
or
by
a
special
opening
at
the
back
of
the
hut
with
some
savages
a
special
reason
for
respecting
the
bones
of
game
and
generally
of
the
animals
which
they
eat
is
a
belief
that
if
the
bones
are
preserved
they
will
in
course
of
time
be
reclothed
with
flesh
and
thus
the
animal
will
come
to
life
again
it
is
therefore
clearly
for
the
interest
of
the
hunter
to
leave
the
bones
intact
since
to
destroy
them
would
be
to
diminish
the
future
supply
of
game
many
of
the
minnetaree
indians
believe
that
the
bones
of
those
bisons
which
they
have
slain
and
divested
of
flesh
rise
again
clothed
with
renewed
flesh
and
quickened
with
life
and
become
fat
and
fit
for
slaughter
the
succeeding
hence
on
the
western
prairies
of
america
the
skulls
of
buffaloes
may
be
seen
arranged
in
circles
and
symmetrical
piles
awaiting
the
resurrection
after
feasting
on
a
dog
the
dacotas
carefully
collect
the
bones
scrape
wash
and
bury
them
partly
as
it
is
said
to
testify
to
the
that
in
feasting
upon
one
of
their
number
no
disrespect
was
meant
to
the
species
itself
and
partly
also
from
a
belief
that
the
bones
of
the
animal
will
rise
and
reproduce
among
the
esquimaux
of
baffin
land
and
hudson
bay
when
a
boy
has
killed
his
first
seal
his
mother
gathers
all
the
bones
and
throws
them
into
a
they
think
that
these
bones
will
become
seals
which
the
boy
will
catch
in
later
life
the
yuracares
indians
of
bolivia
are
at
great
pains
to
collect
all
the
bones
of
the
beasts
birds
and
fishes
which
they
eat
and
to
throw
them
into
a
stream
bury
them
in
the
depths
of
the
forest
or
burn
them
in
the
fire
in
order
that
the
animals
of
the
sort
killed
may
not
be
angry
and
may
allow
themselves
to
be
killed
in
sacrificing
an
animal
the
lapps
regularly
put
aside
the
bones
eyes
ears
heart
lungs
sexual
parts
if
the
animal
was
a
male
and
a
morsel
of
flesh
from
each
limb
then
after
eating
the
remainder
of
the
flesh
they
laid
the
bones
and
the
rest
in
anatomical
order
in
a
coffin
and
buried
them
with
the
usual
rites
believing
that
the
god
to
whom
the
animal
was
sacrificed
would
reclothe
the
bones
with
flesh
and
restore
the
animal
to
life
in
the
subterranean
world
of
the
dead
sometimes
as
after
feasting
on
a
bear
they
seem
to
have
contented
themselves
with
thus
burying
the
bones
thus
the
lapps
expected
the
resurrection
of
the
slain
animal
to
take
place
in
another
world
resembling
in
this
respect
the
kamtchatkans
who
believed
that
every
creature
down
to
the
smallest
fly
would
rise
from
the
dead
and
live
underground
on
the
other
hand
the
north
american
indians
looked
for
the
resurrection
of
the
animals
in
the
present
world
the
habit
observed
especially
by
mongolian
peoples
of
stuffing
the
skin
of
a
sacrificed
animal
or
stretching
it
on
a
framework
points
rather
to
a
belief
in
a
resurrection
of
the
latter
sort
the
objection
commonly
entertained
by
primitive
peoples
to
break
the
bones
of
the
animals
which
they
have
eaten
or
sacrificed
may
be
based
either
on
a
belief
in
the
resurrection
of
the
animals
or
on
a
fear
of
intimidating
other
creatures
of
the
same
species
and
offending
the
ghosts
of
the
slain
animals
the
reluctance
of
north
american
indians
and
esquimaux
to
let
dogs
gnaw
the
bones
of
animals
is
perhaps
only
a
precaution
to
prevent
the
bones
from
being
broken
we
have
already
seen
that
some
rude
races
believe
in
a
resurrection
of
men
as
well
as
of
beasts
and
it
is
quite
natural
that
people
who
entertain
such
a
belief
should
take
care
of
the
bones
of
their
dead
in
order
that
the
original
owners
of
the
bones
may
have
them
to
hand
at
the
critical
moment
hence
in
the
mexican
territories
of
guazacualco
and
yluta
where
the
indians
thought
that
the
dead
would
rise
again
the
bones
of
the
departed
were
deposited
in
baskets
and
hung
up
on
trees
that
their
spirits
might
not
be
obliged
to
grub
in
the
earth
for
them
at
the
resurrection
on
the
other
hand
the
luritcha
tribe
of
central
australia
who
eat
their
enemies
take
steps
to
prevent
their
coming
to
life
again
which
might
prove
very
inconvenient
by
destroying
the
bones
and
especially
the
skulls
of
the
bodies
on
which
they
have
banqueted
the
preceding
review
of
customs
observed
by
savages
for
the
conciliation
and
multiplication
of
animals
which
they
hunt
and
kill
is
fitted
to
impress
us
with
a
lively
sense
of
the
unquestioning
faith
which
primitive
man
reposes
in
the
immortality
of
the
lower
creatures
he
appears
to
assume
as
an
axiom
too
obvious
to
be
disputed
that
beasts
birds
and
fishes
have
souls
like
his
own
which
survive
the
death
of
their
bodies
and
can
be
reborn
in
other
bodies
to
be
again
killed
and
eaten
by
the
hunter
the
whole
series
of
customs
described
in
the
foregoing
which
are
apt
to
strike
the
civilised
reader
as
quaint
and
on
this
fundamental
assumption
a
consideration
of
them
suggests
a
doubt
whether
the
current
explanation
of
the
savage
belief
in
human
immortality
is
adequate
to
account
for
all
the
facts
that
belief
is
commonly
deduced
from
a
primitive
theory
of
dreams
the
savage
it
is
said
fails
to
distinguish
the
visions
of
sleep
from
the
realities
of
waking
life
and
accordingly
when
he
has
dreamed
of
his
dead
friends
he
necessarily
concludes
that
they
have
not
wholly
perished
but
that
their
spirits
continue
to
exist
in
some
place
and
some
form
though
in
the
ordinary
course
of
events
they
elude
the
perceptions
of
his
senses
on
this
theory
the
conceptions
whether
gross
or
refined
whether
repulsive
or
beautiful
which
savages
and
perhaps
civilised
men
have
formed
of
the
state
of
the
departed
would
seem
to
be
no
more
than
elaborate
hypotheses
constructed
to
account
for
appearances
in
dreams
these
towering
structures
for
all
their
radiant
or
gloomy
grandeur
for
all
the
massy
strength
and
solidity
with
which
they
present
themselves
to
the
imagination
of
many
may
turn
out
on
inspection
to
be
mere
visionary
castles
built
of
clouds
and
vapour
which
a
breath
of
reason
suffices
to
melt
into
air
but
even
if
we
grant
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
this
theory
offers
a
ready
explanation
of
the
widespread
belief
in
human
immortality
it
is
less
easy
to
see
how
the
theory
accounts
for
the
corresponding
belief
of
so
many
races
in
the
immortality
of
the
lower
animals
in
his
dreams
the
savage
recognises
the
images
of
his
departed
friends
by
those
familiar
traits
of
feature
voice
and
gesture
which
characterised
them
in
life
but
can
we
suppose
that
he
recognises
dead
beasts
birds
and
fishes
in
like
manner
that
their
images
come
before
him
in
sleep
with
all
the
particular
features
the
minute
individual
differences
which
distinguished
them
in
life
from
their
fellows
so
that
when
he
sees
them
he
can
say
to
himself
for
example
this
is
the
very
tiger
that
i
speared
yesterday
his
carcase
is
dead
but
his
spirit
must
be
still
alive
or
that
is
the
very
salmon
i
caught
and
ate
this
morning
i
certainly
killed
his
body
but
clearly
i
have
not
succeeded
in
destroying
his
soul
no
doubt
it
is
possible
that
the
savage
has
arrived
at
his
theory
of
animal
immortality
by
some
such
process
of
reasoning
but
the
supposition
seems
at
least
more
and
improbable
than
in
the
case
of
human
immortality
and
if
we
admit
the
insufficiency
of
the
explanation
in
the
one
case
we
seem
bound
to
admit
it
though
perhaps
in
a
less
degree
in
the
other
case
also
in
short
we
conclude
that
the
theory
of
dreams
appears
to
be
hardly
enough
by
itself
to
account
for
the
widespread
belief
in
the
immortality
of
men
and
animals
dreams
have
probably
done
much
to
confirm
that
belief
but
would
they
suffice
to
originate
it
we
may
reasonably
doubt
it
accordingly
we
are
driven
to
cast
about
for
some
more
adequate
explanation
of
this
prevalent
and
deeply
rooted
persuasion
in
search
of
such
an
explanation
perhaps
we
need
go
no
further
than
the
sense
of
life
which
every
man
feels
in
his
own
breast
we
have
seen
that
to
the
savage
death
presents
itself
not
as
a
natural
necessity
but
as
a
lamentable
accident
or
crime
that
cuts
short
an
existence
which
but
for
it
might
have
lasted
for
ever
thus
arguing
apparently
from
his
own
sensations
he
conceives
of
life
as
an
indestructible
kind
of
energy
which
when
it
disappears
in
one
form
must
necessarily
reappear
in
another
though
in
the
new
form
it
need
not
be
immediately
perceptible
by
us
in
other
words
he
infers
that
death
does
not
destroy
the
vital
principle
nor
even
the
conscious
personality
but
that
it
merely
transforms
both
of
them
into
other
shapes
which
are
not
the
less
real
because
they
commonly
elude
the
evidence
of
our
senses
if
i
am
right
in
thus
interpreting
the
thought
of
primitive
man
the
savage
view
of
the
nature
of
life
singularly
resembles
the
modern
scientific
doctrine
of
the
conservation
of
energy
according
to
that
doctrine
no
material
energy
ever
perishes
or
is
even
diminished
when
it
seems
to
suffer
diminution
or
extinction
all
that
happens
is
that
a
portion
or
the
whole
of
it
has
been
transmuted
into
other
shapes
which
though
qualitatively
different
from
are
quantitatively
equivalent
to
the
energy
in
its
original
form
in
short
if
we
listen
to
science
nothing
in
the
physical
world
is
ever
lost
but
all
things
are
perpetually
changing
the
sum
of
energy
in
the
universe
is
constant
and
invariable
though
it
undergoes
ceaseless
transformations
a
similar
theory
of
the
indestructibility
of
energy
is
implicitly
applied
by
the
savage
to
explain
the
phenomena
of
life
and
death
and
logically
enough
he
does
not
limit
the
application
to
human
beings
but
extends
it
to
the
lower
animals
therein
he
shews
himself
a
better
reasoner
than
his
civilised
brother
who
commonly
embraces
with
avidity
the
doctrine
of
human
immortality
but
rejects
with
scorn
as
derogatory
to
human
dignity
the
idea
that
animals
have
immortal
souls
and
when
he
attempts
to
confirm
his
own
cherished
belief
in
a
life
after
death
by
appealing
to
similar
beliefs
among
savages
and
inferring
from
them
a
natural
instinct
of
immortality
it
is
well
to
remind
him
that
if
he
stands
by
that
appeal
he
must
like
the
savage
consistently
extend
the
privilege
of
immortality
to
the
despised
lower
animals
for
surely
it
is
improper
for
him
to
pick
and
choose
his
evidence
so
as
to
suit
his
prepossessions
accepting
those
parts
of
the
savage
creed
which
tally
with
his
own
and
rejecting
those
which
do
not
on
logical
and
scientific
grounds
he
seems
bound
to
believe
either
more
or
less
he
must
hold
that
men
and
animals
are
alike
immortal
or
that
neither
of
them
is
so
we
have
seen
that
many
savages
look
forward
to
a
joyful
resurrection
of
men
and
beasts
if
only
a
proper
care
is
taken
of
their
skeletons
the
same
old
bones
they
imagine
will
do
duty
over
again
in
the
next
life
when
they
have
been
decently
clad
in
a
new
garment
of
flesh
this
quaint
fancy
is
reflected
in
many
popular
tales
not
uncommonly
the
animal
or
man
in
the
story
comes
to
life
lame
of
a
limb
because
one
of
his
bones
has
been
eaten
broken
or
lost
in
a
magyar
tale
the
hero
is
cut
in
pieces
but
the
lays
the
bones
together
in
their
proper
order
and
washes
them
with
water
whereupon
the
hero
revives
his
however
has
been
lost
so
the
supplies
its
place
with
one
of
gold
and
ivory
such
stories
as
mannhardt
has
seen
explain
why
pythagoras
who
claimed
to
have
lived
many
lives
one
after
the
other
was
said
to
have
exhibited
his
golden
leg
as
a
proof
of
his
supernatural
pretensions
doubtless
he
explained
that
at
one
of
his
resurrections
a
leg
had
been
broken
or
mislaid
and
that
he
had
replaced
it
like
miss
kilmansegg
with
one
of
gold
similarly
when
the
murdered
pelops
was
restored
to
life
the
shoulder
which
demeter
had
eaten
was
made
good
with
one
of
ivory
which
was
publicly
exhibited
at
elis
down
to
historical
times
the
story
that
one
of
the
members
of
the
mangled
osiris
was
eaten
by
fish
and
that
when
isis
collected
his
scattered
limbs
she
replaced
the
missing
member
with
one
of
wood
may
perhaps
belong
to
the
same
circle
of
beliefs
there
is
a
certain
rule
observed
by
savage
hunters
and
fishers
which
enigmatical
at
first
sight
may
possibly
be
explained
by
this
savage
belief
in
resurrection
a
traveller
in
america
in
the
early
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
was
told
by
a
choctaw
that
the
indians
had
an
obscure
story
somewhat
resembling
that
of
jacob
wrestling
with
an
angel
and
that
the
indians
always
separate
the
sinew
which
shrank
and
that
it
is
never
seen
in
the
venison
exposed
for
sale
he
did
not
know
what
they
did
with
it
his
elder
brother
whom
i
afterwards
met
told
me
that
they
eat
it
as
a
rarity
but
i
have
also
heard
though
on
less
respectable
authority
that
they
refrain
from
it
like
the
ancient
jews
a
gentleman
who
had
lived
on
the
indian
frontier
or
in
the
nation
for
ten
or
fifteen
years
told
me
that
he
had
often
been
surprised
that
the
indians
always
detached
this
sinew
but
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
to
inquire
the
james
adair
who
knew
the
indians
of
the
states
intimately
and
whose
absurd
theories
appear
not
to
have
distorted
his
view
of
the
facts
observes
that
when
in
the
woods
the
indians
cut
a
small
piece
out
of
the
lower
part
of
the
thighs
of
the
deer
they
kill
lengthways
and
pretty
deep
among
the
great
number
of
they
bring
to
our
i
do
not
remember
to
have
observed
one
without
it
and
i
have
been
assured
by
a
gentleman
of
character
who
is
now
an
inhabitant
of
south
carolina
and
well
acquainted
with
the
customs
of
the
northern
indians
that
they
also
cut
a
piece
out
of
the
thigh
of
every
deer
they
kill
and
throw
it
away
and
reckon
it
such
a
dangerous
pollution
to
eat
it
as
to
occasion
sickness
and
other
misfortunes
of
sundry
kinds
especially
by
spoiling
their
guns
from
shooting
with
proper
force
and
in
more
recent
times
the
statement
of
adair
s
informant
has
been
confirmed
by
a
french
missionary
who
has
also
published
the
obscure
story
to
which
the
english
traveller
hodgson
refers
the
loucheux
and
indians
who
roam
the
bleak
steppes
and
forests
that
stretch
from
hudson
s
bay
to
the
rocky
mountains
and
northward
to
the
frozen
sea
are
forbidden
by
custom
to
eat
the
sinew
of
the
legs
of
animals
to
explain
this
custom
they
tell
the
following
sacred
once
upon
a
time
a
man
found
a
burrow
of
porcupines
and
going
down
into
it
after
the
porcupines
he
lost
his
way
in
the
darkness
till
a
kind
giant
called
he
who
sees
before
and
behind
released
him
by
cleaving
open
the
earth
so
the
man
whose
name
was
fireless
and
homeless
lived
with
the
kind
giant
and
the
giant
hunted
elans
and
beavers
for
him
and
carried
him
about
in
the
sheath
of
his
flint
knife
but
know
my
son
said
the
giant
that
he
who
uses
the
sky
as
his
head
is
angry
with
me
and
has
sworn
my
destruction
if
he
slays
me
the
clouds
will
be
tinged
with
my
blood
they
will
be
red
with
it
then
he
gave
the
man
an
axe
made
of
the
tooth
of
a
gigantic
beaver
and
went
forth
to
meet
his
foe
but
from
under
the
ice
the
man
heard
a
dull
muffled
sound
it
was
a
whale
which
was
making
this
noise
because
it
was
naked
and
cold
warned
by
the
man
the
giant
went
toward
the
whale
which
took
human
shape
and
rushed
upon
the
giant
it
was
the
wicked
giant
the
kind
giant
s
enemy
the
two
struggled
together
for
a
long
time
till
the
kind
giant
cried
oh
my
son
cut
cut
the
sinew
of
the
the
man
cut
the
sinew
and
the
wicked
giant
fell
down
and
was
slain
that
is
why
the
indians
do
not
eat
the
sinew
of
the
leg
afterwards
one
day
the
sky
suddenly
flushed
a
fiery
red
so
fireless
and
homeless
knew
that
the
kind
giant
was
no
more
and
he
wept
this
myth
it
is
almost
needless
to
observe
does
not
really
explain
the
custom
people
do
not
usually
observe
a
custom
because
on
a
particular
occasion
a
mythical
being
is
said
to
have
acted
in
a
certain
way
but
on
the
contrary
they
very
often
invent
myths
to
explain
why
they
practise
certain
customs
dismissing
therefore
the
story
of
fireless
and
homeless
as
a
myth
invented
to
explain
why
the
indians
abstain
from
eating
a
particular
sinew
it
may
be
suggested
that
the
original
reason
for
observing
the
custom
was
a
belief
that
the
sinew
in
question
was
necessary
to
reproduction
and
that
deprived
of
it
the
slain
animals
could
not
come
to
life
again
and
stock
the
steppes
and
prairies
either
of
the
present
world
or
of
the
spirit
land
we
have
seen
that
the
resurrection
of
animals
is
a
common
article
of
savage
faith
and
that
when
the
lapps
bury
the
skeleton
of
the
male
bear
in
the
hope
of
its
resurrection
they
are
careful
to
bury
the
genital
parts
along
with
it
however
subsequent
enquiries
make
it
probable
that
the
indian
practice
of
cutting
out
the
hamstring
of
deer
has
no
other
object
than
that
of
preventing
eaters
of
venison
from
going
lame
among
the
cherokee
we
are
told
on
killing
a
deer
the
hunter
always
makes
an
incision
in
the
hind
quarter
and
removes
the
hamstring
because
this
tendon
when
severed
draws
up
into
the
flesh
ergo
any
one
who
should
unfortunately
partake
of
the
hamstring
would
find
his
limbs
drawn
up
in
the
same
thus
the
superstition
seems
to
rest
on
the
common
principle
of
homoeopathic
or
imitative
magic
that
an
eater
infects
himself
with
the
qualities
of
the
animal
of
whose
flesh
he
partakes
many
instances
of
the
application
of
that
principle
have
met
us
already
but
some
hunters
hamstring
the
game
for
a
different
purpose
they
hope
thereby
to
prevent
the
dead
beast
or
its
ghost
from
getting
up
and
running
away
this
is
the
motive
alleged
for
the
practice
by
koui
hunters
in
laos
they
think
that
the
spells
which
they
utter
in
the
chase
may
lose
their
magical
virtue
and
that
the
slaughtered
animal
may
consequently
come
to
life
again
and
escape
to
prevent
that
catastrophe
they
therefore
hamstring
the
beast
as
soon
as
they
have
butchered
it
when
an
esquimau
of
alaska
has
killed
a
fox
he
carefully
cuts
the
tendons
of
all
the
animal
s
legs
in
order
to
prevent
the
ghost
from
reanimating
the
body
and
walking
about
but
hamstringing
the
carcase
is
not
the
only
measure
which
the
prudent
savage
adopts
for
the
sake
of
disabling
the
ghost
of
his
victim
in
old
days
when
the
aino
went
out
hunting
and
killed
a
fox
first
they
took
care
to
tie
its
mouth
up
tightly
in
order
to
prevent
the
ghost
of
the
animal
from
sallying
forth
and
warning
its
fellows
against
the
approach
of
the
hunter
the
gilyaks
of
the
amoor
river
put
out
the
eyes
of
the
seals
they
have
killed
lest
the
ghosts
of
the
slain
animals
should
know
their
slayers
and
avenge
their
death
by
spoiling
the
the
custom
of
putting
out
the
eyes
of
slaughtered
animals
appears
to
be
not
uncommon
among
primitive
peoples
and
we
may
suspect
that
even
where
a
different
reason
is
alleged
for
it
the
true
original
motive
was
to
blind
the
dangerous
ghost
of
the
injured
creature
and
so
to
incapacitate
it
for
retaliating
on
the
slayer
thus
when
a
samoyed
has
killed
a
wild
reindeer
one
of
the
first
things
he
does
is
to
cut
out
the
eyes
and
throw
them
away
in
order
to
ensure
a
good
bag
in
future
and
he
buries
the
eyes
in
some
place
where
no
woman
or
adult
girl
is
likely
to
step
over
them
since
that
also
would
spoil
his
luck
in
the
chase
among
the
tribes
of
africa
hunters
pluck
out
the
right
eye
of
any
animal
they
have
killed
and
pour
a
charmed
medicine
into
the
empty
socket
among
the
thompson
indians
of
british
columbia
a
man
whose
daughter
has
just
arrived
at
puberty
may
not
hunt
or
trap
for
a
month
or
he
will
have
no
luck
moreover
he
should
cut
off
the
head
of
the
first
grouse
he
snares
pluck
out
the
eyes
and
insert
two
small
roots
of
the
pursch
in
the
orbits
and
another
in
its
mouth
and
having
done
so
he
ought
to
hang
up
the
bird
s
head
above
his
pillow
if
he
neglects
these
precautions
he
will
not
be
able
to
snare
any
more
grouse
or
other
small
game
no
doubt
the
ceremonial
pollution
contracted
by
his
daughter
at
this
critical
period
of
her
life
is
supposed
to
infect
the
hunter
and
render
him
unacceptable
to
the
game
hence
it
seems
a
mere
elementary
dictate
of
prudence
to
hoodwink
the
grouse
effectually
by
putting
out
their
eyes
sometimes
perhaps
the
cutting
out
of
the
eyes
of
fierce
and
powerful
animals
may
be
a
rational
not
a
superstitious
precaution
thus
the
kamtchatkans
who
stab
with
knives
the
eyes
of
slain
bears
before
they
cut
the
carcases
up
allege
as
their
reason
for
doing
so
that
bears
which
seem
to
be
dead
of
their
wounds
will
sometimes
revive
and
kill
their
killers
it
appears
to
be
a
common
custom
with
savage
hunters
to
cut
out
the
tongues
of
the
animals
which
they
kill
on
the
analogy
of
the
foregoing
customs
we
may
conjecture
that
the
removal
of
the
tongues
is
sometimes
a
precaution
to
prevent
the
ghosts
of
the
creatures
from
telling
their
sad
fate
to
their
sympathising
comrades
the
living
animals
of
the
same
sort
who
would
naturally
be
frightened
and
so
keep
out
of
the
hunter
s
way
thus
for
example
omaha
hunters
remove
the
tongue
of
a
slain
buffalo
through
an
opening
made
in
the
animal
s
throat
the
tongues
thus
removed
are
sacred
and
may
not
touch
any
tool
or
metal
except
when
they
are
boiling
in
the
kettles
at
the
sacred
tent
they
are
eaten
as
sacred
food
indian
cut
out
what
they
call
the
bear
s
little
tongue
a
fleshy
mass
under
the
real
tongue
and
keep
it
for
good
luck
in
hunting
or
burn
it
to
determine
from
its
crackling
and
so
on
whether
the
soul
of
the
slain
bear
is
angry
with
them
or
not
in
the
hero
commonly
cuts
out
the
tongue
of
the
wild
beast
which
he
has
slain
and
preserves
it
as
a
token
the
incident
serves
to
shew
that
the
custom
was
a
common
one
since
reflect
with
accuracy
the
customs
and
beliefs
of
a
primitive
age
on
the
other
hand
the
tongues
of
certain
animals
as
the
otter
and
the
eagle
are
torn
out
and
sometimes
worn
round
their
necks
by
thlinkeet
and
haida
shamans
as
a
means
of
conferring
superhuman
knowledge
and
power
on
their
possessors
in
particular
an
otter
s
tongue
is
supposed
to
convey
a
knowledge
of
the
language
of
all
inanimate
objects
of
birds
animals
and
other
living
creatures
to
the
shaman
who
wears
it
in
a
little
bag
hung
round
his
neck
when
a
galla
priest
sacrifices
an
animal
and
decides
that
the
omens
are
favourable
he
cuts
out
the
tongue
sticks
his
thumb
through
it
and
so
flays
the
animal
in
certain
cases
gallas
cut
out
the
tongues
of
oxen
and
wear
them
on
their
heads
as
tokens
in
bohemia
a
fox
s
tongue
is
worn
as
an
amulet
to
make
a
timid
person
bold
in
oldenburg
and
belgium
it
is
a
remedy
for
erysipelas
in
bohemia
the
tongue
of
a
male
snake
if
cut
from
the
living
animal
on
george
s
eve
and
placed
under
a
person
s
tongue
will
confer
the
gift
of
eloquence
the
homeric
greeks
cut
out
the
tongues
of
sacrificial
victims
and
burned
them
according
to
some
accounts
the
tongues
of
the
victims
were
assigned
by
the
greeks
to
hermes
as
the
god
of
speech
or
to
his
human
representatives
the
heralds
on
the
principles
of
sympathetic
magic
we
might
expect
that
heralds
should
taste
the
tongues
of
sacrificial
victims
to
strengthen
their
voices
or
to
acquire
the
gift
of
tongues
the
conjecture
that
the
practice
of
cutting
out
the
tongues
of
dead
animals
may
sometimes
be
a
precaution
to
prevent
their
ghosts
from
telling
tales
is
to
some
extent
confirmed
by
a
ceremony
which
the
bechuanas
used
to
observe
after
a
battle
it
was
customary
with
them
on
these
occasions
to
sacrifice
a
fine
black
ox
called
the
expiatory
victim
cut
off
the
tip
of
its
tongue
and
extract
one
of
its
eyes
together
with
a
piece
of
the
hamstring
and
a
piece
of
the
principal
tendon
of
the
shoulder
and
the
severed
parts
were
afterwards
carefully
fried
along
with
some
medicinal
herbs
in
a
horn
by
a
the
reasons
for
thus
mutilating
the
animal
were
explained
by
a
native
to
two
french
missionaries
if
we
cut
out
and
purify
the
victim
s
tongue
said
he
the
motive
is
to
induce
the
guardian
deities
to
prevent
the
enemy
from
speaking
ill
of
us
we
ask
also
that
the
sinews
of
their
feet
and
hands
may
fail
them
in
the
battle
and
that
their
eyes
may
not
cast
a
covetous
look
on
our
in
this
custom
the
sacrificial
ox
appears
to
be
treated
as
the
ceremonial
equivalent
of
the
enemy
accordingly
by
cutting
out
its
tongue
you
obviously
prevent
your
enemy
from
cursing
you
for
how
can
he
curse
you
if
he
has
no
tongue
similarly
by
hamstringing
the
beast
you
ensure
that
the
legs
and
arms
of
your
adversary
will
fail
him
in
the
battle
and
by
gouging
out
the
ox
s
eye
you
make
perfectly
certain
that
the
foe
will
never
be
able
to
cast
a
longing
eye
on
your
fat
beeves
thus
for
all
practical
purposes
the
mutilation
of
the
ox
is
quite
as
effective
as
the
mutilation
of
the
enemy
s
dead
which
is
sometimes
practised
by
savages
from
similar
superstitious
motives
thus
on
the
return
from
a
field
of
battle
the
baganda
used
to
cut
up
one
or
two
of
the
enemy
s
dead
scoop
out
the
eyes
cut
off
the
ears
and
lay
the
limbs
on
the
road
taken
by
the
returning
army
to
prevent
evil
following
the
nature
of
the
evil
which
the
baganda
warriors
feared
to
incur
if
they
did
not
mutilate
the
dead
in
this
fashion
is
not
mentioned
but
we
may
conjecture
that
by
gouging
out
the
eyes
and
ears
of
their
slain
foes
they
hoped
to
make
their
angry
ghosts
blind
and
deaf
or
perhaps
upon
the
principles
of
homoeopathic
magic
they
counted
on
maiming
their
living
foes
in
like
manner
some
of
the
aborigines
of
australia
cut
off
the
thumbs
of
their
dead
enemies
in
order
that
their
ghosts
may
not
be
able
to
throw
spears
other
australian
tribes
burn
off
the
thumb
nails
of
their
own
dead
to
prevent
the
poor
ghost
from
scratching
a
way
for
himself
out
of
the
grave
when
the
tupi
indians
of
brazil
killed
and
ate
a
prisoner
the
thumb
was
cut
off
because
of
its
use
in
archery
an
art
concerning
which
they
were
singularly
superstitious
what
was
done
with
it
does
not
appear
except
that
it
was
not
eaten
like
the
perhaps
these
indians
like
the
australians
thought
by
this
mutilation
to
disarm
the
dangerous
ghost
of
their
victim
when
any
bad
man
died
the
esquimaux
of
bering
strait
used
to
cut
the
sinews
of
his
arms
and
legs
in
order
to
prevent
the
shade
from
returning
to
the
body
and
causing
it
to
walk
at
night
as
a
in
travancore
the
ghosts
of
men
who
have
been
hanged
for
murder
are
particularly
dreaded
so
in
order
to
incapacitate
them
from
roaming
about
and
attacking
people
it
used
to
be
customary
to
slice
off
a
criminal
s
heels
with
a
sword
or
hamstring
him
at
the
moment
when
he
swung
free
from
the
ladder
the
omaha
indians
used
to
slit
the
soles
of
a
man
who
had
been
killed
by
lightning
in
order
to
prevent
his
ghost
from
walking
among
the
awemba
of
northern
rhodesia
murderers
often
inflicted
shocking
mutilations
on
the
bodies
of
their
victims
this
was
done
it
is
said
to
prevent
the
spirit
of
the
murdered
person
from
exacting
vengeance
and
even
if
only
the
joint
of
the
first
or
the
little
finger
were
cut
off
such
mutilation
would
suffice
for
this
these
examples
suggest
that
many
other
mutilations
which
savages
practise
on
their
dead
enemies
may
spring
not
from
the
blind
fury
of
hatred
but
from
a
cool
calculation
of
the
best
mode
of
protecting
themselves
against
the
very
natural
resentment
of
the
ghosts
by
mutilating
the
corpse
they
apparently
hope
to
maim
the
ghost
and
so
to
render
him
incapable
of
harming
them
at
all
events
it
appears
that
in
certain
circumstances
some
savages
treat
the
dead
bodies
of
men
and
beasts
much
alike
by
hamstringing
them
in
order
to
prevent
their
ghosts
from
getting
up
and
walking
so
consistent
and
impartial
is
the
primitive
philosopher
in
his
attitude
to

chapter
xv
the
propitiation
of
vermin
by
farmers
the
enemies
of
the
crops
besides
the
animals
which
primitive
man
dreads
for
their
strength
and
ferocity
and
those
which
he
reveres
on
account
of
the
benefits
which
he
expects
from
them
there
is
another
class
of
creatures
which
he
sometimes
deems
it
necessary
to
conciliate
by
worship
and
sacrifice
these
are
the
vermin
that
infest
his
crops
and
his
cattle
to
rid
himself
of
these
deadly
foes
the
farmer
has
recourse
to
many
superstitious
devices
of
which
though
some
are
meant
to
destroy
or
intimidate
the
vermin
others
aim
at
propitiating
them
and
persuading
them
by
fair
means
to
spare
the
fruits
of
the
earth
and
the
herds
thus
esthonian
peasants
in
the
island
of
oesel
stand
in
great
awe
of
the
weevil
an
insect
which
is
exceedingly
destructive
to
the
grain
they
give
it
a
fine
name
and
if
a
child
is
about
to
kill
a
weevil
they
say
don
t
do
it
the
more
we
hurt
him
the
more
he
hurts
if
they
find
a
weevil
they
bury
it
in
the
earth
instead
of
killing
it
some
even
put
the
weevil
under
a
stone
in
the
field
and
offer
corn
to
it
they
think
that
thus
it
is
appeased
and
does
less
harm
amongst
the
saxons
of
transylvania
in
order
to
keep
sparrows
from
the
corn
the
sower
begins
by
throwing
the
first
handful
of
seed
backwards
over
his
head
saying
that
is
for
you
to
guard
the
corn
against
the
attacks
of
he
shuts
his
eyes
and
scatters
three
handfuls
of
oats
in
different
directions
having
made
this
offering
to
the
he
feels
sure
that
they
will
spare
the
corn
a
transylvanian
way
of
securing
the
crops
against
all
birds
beasts
and
insects
is
this
after
he
has
finished
sowing
the
sower
goes
once
more
from
end
to
end
of
the
field
imitating
the
gesture
of
sowing
but
with
an
empty
hand
as
he
does
so
he
says
i
sow
this
for
the
animals
i
sow
it
for
everything
that
flies
and
creeps
that
walks
and
stands
that
sings
and
springs
in
the
name
of
god
the
father
the
huzuls
of
the
carpathians
believe
that
the
bite
of
the
weasel
is
poisonous
and
that
the
animal
commits
ravages
on
the
cattle
yet
they
take
care
never
to
kill
a
weasel
lest
the
surviving
kinsfolk
of
the
deceased
should
avenge
his
death
on
the
herds
of
his
murderer
they
even
celebrate
a
festival
of
weasels
either
on
matthew

or
on

on

the

is
a
german
way
of
freeing
a
garden
from
caterpillars
after
sunset
or
at
midnight
the
mistress
of
the
house
or
another
female
member
of
the
family
walks

the
attempts
thus
made
by
european
peasants
to
mollify
the
rage
and
avert
the
ravages
of
vermin
have
their
counterpart
in
the
similar
observances
of
savages
when
the
matabele
find
caterpillars
in
their
fields
they
put
an
ear
of
corn
in
a
calabash
fill
the
vessel
up
with
caterpillars
and
set
it
down
on
a

thus
to

to

that
the

of

are
animated
by
the
souls
of
the
human
dead
hence
in
order
to
rid

of
these

they
politely
request
the

to
leave
the

and
repair

generally
they
wage

on

at

by

that

all
its
companions
away
into

sometimes
in
dealing
with
vermin
the
farmer
aims
at
hitting
a
happy
mean
between
excessive
rigour
on
the
one
hand
and
weak
indulgence
on
the
other
kind
but
firm
he
tempers
severity
with
mercy
an
ancient
greek
treatise
on
farming
advises
the
husbandman
who
would
rid
his
lands
of
mice
to
act
thus
take
a
sheet
of
paper
and
write
on
it
as
follows
i
adjure
you
ye
mice
here
present
that
ye
neither
injure
me
nor
suffer
another
mouse
to
do
so
i
give
you
yonder
field
here
you
specify
the
field
but
if
ever
i
catch
you
here
again
by
the
mother
of
the
gods
i
will
rend
you
in
seven
write
this
and
stick
the
paper
on
an
unhewn
stone
in
the
field
before
sunrise
taking
care
to
keep
the
written
side
in
the
ardennes
they
say
that
to
get
rid
of
rats
you
should
repeat
the
following
words
verbum
apud
deum
male
rats
and
female
rats
i
conjure
you
by
the
great
god
to
go
out
of
my
house
out
of
all
my
habitations
and
to
betake
yourselves
to
such
and
such
a
place
there
to
end
your
days
reversis
et
desembarassis
virgo
potens
clemens
then
write
the
same
words
on
pieces
of
paper
fold
them
up
and
place
one
of
them
under
the
door
by
which
the
rats
are
to
go
forth
and
the
other
on
the
road
which
they
are
to
take
this
exorcism
should
be
performed
at
sunrise
some
years
ago
an
american
farmer
was
reported
to
have
written
a
civil
letter
to
the
rats
telling
them
that
his
crops
were
short
that
he
could
not
afford
to
keep
them
through
the
winter
that
he
had
been
very
kind
to
them
and
that
for
their
own
good
he
thought
they
had
better
leave
him
and
go
to
some
of
his
neighbours
who
had
more
grain
this
document
he
pinned
to
a
post
in
his
barn
for
the
rats
to
read
the
mouse
is
one
of
the
most
dreaded
enemies
of
the
in
celebes
many
therefore
are
the
prayers
and
incantations
which
prudent
farmers
resort
to
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
the
vermin
from
their
fields
thus
for
example
a
man
will
run
round
his
field
saying
pruner
is
your
name
creep
not
through
my
rice
be
blind
and
deaf
creep
not
through
my
rice
if
you
must
creep
through
rice
go
and
creep
through
other
the
following
formula
is
equally
effective
pruner
is
your
real
name
mouse
is
your
down
in
the
evening
land
is
the
stone
on
which
you
ought
to
sit
in
the
west
in
java
is
your
or
again
o
longtail
longtail
eat
not
my
rice
it
is
the
rice
of
a
prince
it
is
the
field
of
one
who
is
the
aino
of
japan
believe
that
god
first
created
rats
and
mice
at
erum
kotan
which
means
rat
indeed
there
are
a
great
many
rats
and
mice
there
even
now
and
the
people
of
the
village
worship
mice
and
offer
them
libations
and
sacred
sticks
whittled
at
the
top
into
shavings
grateful
for
these
attentions
the
mice
spare
the
gardens
and
will
not
nibble
at
the
roots
and
the
fruits
but
if
the
people
omit
to
worship
the
mice
or
if
they
are
rash
enough
to
speak
evil
of
them
the
creatures
are
angry
and
eat
up
the
garden
produce
the
havoc
which
rats
and
mice
now
work
in
the
gardens
of
the
aino
every
year
is
attributed
to
the
modern
neglect
of
the
people
to
worship
the
vermin
sometimes
the
desired
object
is
supposed
to
be
attained
by
treating
with
high
distinction
one
or
two
chosen
individuals
of
the
obnoxious
species
while
the
rest
are
pursued
with
relentless
rigour
in
the
east
indian
island
of
bali
the
mice
which
ravage
the
are
caught
in
great
numbers
and
burned
in
the
same
way
that
corpses
are
burned
but
two
of
the
captured
mice
are
allowed
to
live
and
receive
a
little
packet
of
white
linen
then
the
people
bow
down
before
them
as
before
gods
and
let
them
go
in
the
kangean
archipelago
east
indies
when
the
mice
prove
very
destructful
to
the
the
people
rid
themselves
of
the
pest
in
the
following
manner
on
a
friday
when
the
usual
service
in
the
mosque
is
over
four
pairs
of
mice
are
solemnly
united
in
marriage
by
the
priest
each
pair
is
then
shut
up
in
a
miniature
canoe
about
a
foot
long
these
canoes
are
filled
with
rice
and
other
fruits
of
the
earth
and
the
four
pairs
of
mice
are
then
escorted
to
the
just
as
if
it
were
a
real
wedding
wherever
the
procession
passes
the
people
beat
with
all
their
might
on
their
on
reaching
the
shore
the
canoes
with
their
little
inmates
are
launched
and
left
to
the
mercy
of
the
winds
and
waves
when
the
farms
of
the
sea
dyaks
or
ibans
of
sarawak
are
much
pestered
by
birds
and
insects
they
catch
a
specimen
of
each
kind
of
vermin
one
sparrow
one
grasshopper
and
so
on
put
them
in
a
tiny
boat
of
bark
with
provisions
and
then
allow
the
little
vessel
with
its
obnoxious
passengers
to
float
down
the
river
if
that
does
not
drive
the
pests
away
the
dyaks
resort
to
what
they
deem
a
more
effectual
mode
of
accomplishing
the
same
purpose
they
make
a
clay
crocodile
as
large
as
life
and
set
it
up
in
the
fields
where
they
offer
it
food
and
cloth
and
sacrifice
a
fowl
and
a
pig
before
it
mollified
by
these
attentions
the
ferocious
animal
very
soon
gobbles
up
all
the
creatures
that
devour
the
crops
in
some
parts
of
bohemia
the
peasant
though
he
kills
field
mice
and
grey
mice
without
scruple
always
spares
white
mice
if
he
finds
a
white
mouse
he
takes
it
up
carefully
and
makes
a
comfortable
bed
for
it
in
the
window
for
if
it
died
the
luck
of
the
house
would
be
gone
and
the
grey
mice
would
multiply
fearfully
in
the
dwelling
in
albania
if
the
fields
or
vineyards
are
ravaged
by
locusts
or
beetles
some
of
the
women
will
assemble
with
dishevelled
hair
catch
a
few
of
the
insects
and
march
with
them
in
a
funeral
procession
to
a
spring
or
stream
in
which
they
drown
the
creatures
then
one
of
the
women
sings
o
locusts
and
beetles
who
have
left
us
bereaved
and
the
dirge
is
taken
up
and
repeated
by
all
the
women
in
chorus
thus
by
celebrating
the
obsequies
of
a
few
locusts
and
beetles
they
hope
to
bring
about
the
death
of
them
all
when
caterpillars
invaded
a
vineyard
or
field
in
syria
the
virgins
were
gathered
and
one
of
the
caterpillars
was
taken
and
a
girl
made
its
mother
then
they
bewailed
and
buried
it
thereafter
they
conducted
the
mother
to
the
place
where
the
caterpillars
were
consoling
her
in
order
that
all
the
caterpillars
might
leave
the
garden
on
the
first
of
september
russian
girls
make
small
coffins
of
turnips
and
other
vegetables
enclose
flies
and
other
insects
in
them
and
then
bury
them
with
a
great
show
of
in
south
africa
a
plague
of
caterpillars
is
removed
by
a
number
of
small
caffre
girls
who
go
singing
through
the
fields
they
wail
as
they
pass
through
the
languishing
crops
and
thus
invoke
the
aid
and
pity
of
some
ancestral
spirits
the
mournful
rite
ends
with
a
dance
on
a
plot
of
ground
overlooking
the
fields
on
the
shore
of
delagoa
bay
there
thrives
a
small
brown
beetle
which
is
very
destructive
to
the
beans
and
maize
the
baronga
call
it
in
december
or
january
when
the
insects
begin
to
swarm
women
are
sent
to
collect
them
from
the
in
shells
when
they
have
done
so
a
twin
girl
is
charged
with
the
duty
of
throwing
the
insects
into
a
neighbouring
lake
accompanied
by
a
woman
of
mature
years
and
carrying
the
beetles
in
a
calabash
the
girl
goes
on
her
mission
without
saying
a
word
to
any
one
at
her
back
marches
the
whole
troop
of
women
their
arms
waists
and
heads
covered
with
grass
and
holding
in
their
hands
branches
of
manioc
with
large
leaves
which
they
wave
to
and
fro
while
they
chant
the
words
go
away
leave
our
fields
go
away
leave
our
fields
the
little
girl
throws
her
calabash
with
the
beetles
into
the
water
without
looking
behind
her
and
thereupon
the
women
bellow
out
obscene
songs
which
they
never
dare
to
utter
except
on
this
occasion
and
at
the
ceremony
for
making
rain
another
mode
of
getting
rid
of
vermin
and
other
noxious
creatures
without
hurting
their
feelings
or
shewing
them
disrespect
is
to
make
images
of
them
apollonius
of

said
to
have
cleared

of
scorpions
by
making
a
bronze
image
of
a
scorpion
and
burying
it
under
a

used
to
be

scorpions
by
an
image
of
a
bird
holding

scorpion
in

an
arab
writer
tells
of
a
golden
locust

guarded

from

of
locusts
and
he
also

gregory
of
tours
tells
us
that
the
city
of
paris
used
to
be
free
of
dormice
and
serpents
but
that
in
his
lifetime
while
they
were
cleaning
a
sewer
they
found
a
bronze
serpent
and
a
bronze
dormouse
and
removed
them
since
then
adds
the
good
bishop
dormice
and
serpents
without
number
have
been
seen
in
when
their
land
was
overrun
with
mice
the
philistines
made
golden
images
of
the
vermin
and
sent
them
out
of
the
country
in
a
new
cart
drawn
by
two
cows
hoping
that
the
real
mice
would
simultaneously
depart
so
when
a
swarm
of
serpents
afflicted
the
israelites
in
the
desert
they
made
a
serpent
of
brass
and
set
it
on
a
pole
as
a
mode
of
staying
the
plague
mouse
apollo
and
wolf
apollo
some
of
the
greek
gods
were
worshipped
under
titles
derived
from
the
vermin
or
other
pests
which
they
were
supposed
to
avert
or
exterminate
thus
we
hear
of
mouse
apollo
locust
apollo
and
mildew
apollo
of
locust
hercules
and
hercules
of
foxy
dionysus
and
of
zeus
the
or
averter
of
flies
if
we
could
trace
all
these
and
similar
worships
to
their
origin
we
should
probably
find
that
they
were
at
first
addressed
not
to
the
high
gods
as
the
protectors
of
mankind
but
to
the
baleful
things
themselves
the
mice
locusts
mildew
and
so
forth
with
the
intention
of
flattering
and
soothing
them
of
disarming
their
malignity
and
of
persuading
them
to
spare
their
worshippers
we
know
that
the
romans
worshipped
the
mildew
the
farmer
s
plague
under
its
own
proper
name
the
ravages
committed
by
mice
among
the
crops
both
in
ancient
and
modern
times
are
notorious
and
according
to
a
tradition
which
may
be
substantially
correct
the
worship
of
the
mouse
smintheus
apollo
was
instituted
to
avert
them
the
image
of
a
mouse
which
stood
beside
apollo
s
tripod
in
the
god
s
temple
in
the
troad
may
be
compared
with
the
golden
mice
which
the
philistines
made
for
the
purpose
of
ridding
themselves
of
the
vermin
and
the
tame
mice
kept
in
his
sanctuary
together
with
the
white
mice
which
lived
under
the
altar
would
on
this
hypothesis
be
parallel
to
the
white
mice
which
the
bohemian
peasant
still
cherishes
as
the
best
way
of
keeping
down
the
numbers
of
their
brethren
an
oriental
counterpart
of
the
mouse
apollo
is
the
ancient
pillar
or
rude
idol
which
the
chams
of
call
or
god
rat
and
to
which
they
offer
sacrifices
whenever
rats
infest
their
fields
in
excessive
numbers
another
epithet
applied
to
apollo
which
probably
admits
of
a
similar
explanation
is
wolfish
various
legends
set
forth
how
the
god
received
the
title
of
wolfish
because
he
exterminated
wolves
indeed
this
function
was
definitely
attributed
to
him
by
the
epithet
arguing
from
the
analogy
of
the
preceding
cases
we
may
suppose
that
at
first
the
wolves
themselves
were
propitiated
by
fair
words
and
sacrifices
to
induce
them
to
spare
man
and
beast
and
that
at
a
later
time
when
the
greeks
or
rather
the
enlightened
portion
of
them
had
outgrown
this
rude
form
of
worship
they
transferred
the
duty
of
keeping
off
the
wolves
to
a
beneficent
deity
who
discharged
the
same
useful
office
for
other
pests
such
as
mice
locusts
and
mildew
a
reminiscence
of
the
direct
propitiation
of
the
fierce
and
dangerous
beasts
themselves
is
preserved
in
the
legends
told
to
explain
the
origin
of
the
lyceum
or
place
of
wolves
at
athens
and
of
the
sanctuary
of
wolfish
apollo
at
sicyon
it
is
said
that
once
when
athens
was
infested
by
wolves
apollo
commanded
sacrifices
to
be
offered
on
the
place
of
wolves
and
the
smell
proved
fatal
to
the
animals
similarly
at
sicyon
when
the
flocks
suffered
heavily
from
the
ravages
of
wolves
the
same
god
directed
the
shepherds
to
set
forth
meat
mixed
with
a
certain
bark
and
the
wolves
devoured
the
tainted
meat
and
perished
these
legends
probably
reflect
in
a
distorted
form
an
old
custom
of
sacrificing
to
the
wolves
in
other
words
of
feeding
them
to
mollify
their
ferocity
and
win
their
favour
we
know
that
such
a
custom
prevailed
among
the
letts
down
to
comparatively
recent
times
in
the
month
of
december
about
christmas
time
they
sacrificed
a
goat
to
the
wolves
with
strange
idolatrous
rites
at
a
for
the
purpose
of
inducing
the
wolves
to
spare
the
flocks
and
herds
after
offering
the
sacrifice
they
used
to
brag
that
no
beast
of
theirs
would
fall
a
victim
to
the
ravening
maw
of
a
wolf
for
all
the
rest
of
that
year
no
not
though
the
pack
were
to
run
right
through
the
herd
sacrifices
of
this
sort
are
reported
to
have
been
secretly
offered
by
the
letts
as
late
as
the
seventeenth
century
and
if
we
knew
more
of
peasant
life
in
ancient
greece
we
might
find
that
on
winter
days
while
aristotle
was
expounding
his
philosophy
in
the
lyceum
or
place
of
wolves
at
athens
the
attic
peasant
was
still
carrying
forth
in
the
crisp
frosty
air
his
offering
to
the
wolves
which
all
night
long
had
been
howling
round
his
sheepfold
in
a
snowy
glen
of
parnes
or
pentelicus
chapter
xvi
the
transmigration
of
human
souls
into
animals
with
many
savages
a
reason
for
respecting
and
sparing
certain
species
of
animals
is
a
belief
that
the
souls
of
their
dead
kinsfolk
are
lodged
in
these
creatures
thus
the
indians
of
cayenne
refuse
to
eat
certain
large
fish
because
they
say
that
the
soul
of
some
one
of
their
relations
might
be
in
the
fish
and
that
hence
in
eating
the
fish
they
might
swallow
the
soul
the
piaroas
indians
of
the
orinoco
believe
that
the
tapir
is
their
ancestor
and
that
the
souls
of
the
dying
transmigrate
into
animals
of
that
species
hence
they
will
never
hunt
the
tapir
nor
eat
its
flesh
it
may
even
ravage
their
crops
with
impunity
they
will
not
attempt
to
ward
it
off
or
scare
it
away
the
canelos
indians
of
ecuador
also
believe
in
the
transmigration
of
souls
it
is
especially
under
the
form
of
jaguars
that
they
expect
to
be
born
again
hence
they
refuse
to
attack
a
jaguar
except
by
way
of
righteous
retribution
for
some
wrong
he
has
done
them
the
doctrine
of
transmigration
finds
favour
also
with
the
quixos
indians
an
old
man
told
the
italian
traveller
osculati
that
the
soul
is
a
breath
which
passes
from
the
human
body
into
an
animal
and
on
the
death
of
the
animal
shifts
its
quarters
to
another
body
the
caingua
indians
of
paraguay
think
that
the
souls
of
the
dead
which
are
unable
to
depart
this
earth
are
born
again
in
the
shape
of
animals
for
that
reason
many
of
them
refuse
to
eat
the
flesh
of
the
domestic
pig
because
they
say
he
was
a
once
when
a
spaniard
was
out
hunting
with
two
piros
indians
of
peru
they
passed
a
deserted
house
in
which
they
saw
a
fine
jaguar
the
indians
drew
the
spaniard
away
and
when
he
asked
why
they
did
not
attack
the
animal
they
said
it
was
our
sister
she
died
at
the
last
rains
we
abandoned
the
hut
and
on
the
second
night
she
came
back
it
was
the
beautiful
similarly
a
missionary
remarked
of
the
chiriguanos
indians
of
bolivia
that
they
must
have
some
idea
of
the
transmigration
of
souls
for
one
day
while
he
was
talking
with
a
woman
of
the
tribe
who
had
left
her
daughter
in
a
neighbouring
village
she
started
at
sight
of
a
fox
passing
near
and
exclaimed
may
it
not
be
the
soul
of
my
daughter
who
has
died
the
colombian
indians
in
the
district
of
popayan
will
not
kill
the
deer
of
their
forests
and
entertain
such
a
respect
for
these
animals
that
they
view
with
horror
and
indignation
any
one
who
dares
to
eat
venison
in
their
presence
they
say
that
the
souls
of
persons
who
have
led
a
good
life
are
in
the
deer
in
like
manner
the
indians
of
california
formerly
refused
to
eat
the
flesh
of
large
game
because
they
held
that
the
bodies
of
all
large
animals
contained
the
souls
of
past
generations
of
men
and
women
however
the
indians
who
were
maintained
at
the
spanish
missions
and
received
their
rations
in
the
form
of
beef
had
to
overcome
their
conscientious
scruples
in
regard
to
cattle
once
a
wishing
to
amuse
himself
at
the
expense
of
the
devout
cooked
a
dish
of
bear
s
flesh
for
them
and
told
them
it
was
beef
they
ate
heartily
of
it
but
when
they
learned
the
trick
that
had
been
played
on
them
they
were
seized
with
retchings
which
only
ended
with
the
reappearance
of
the
obnoxious
meat
a
reproach
hurled
by
the
wild
tribes
at
their
brethren
who
had
fallen
under
european
influence
was
they
eat
venison
californian
indians
have
been
known
to
plead
for
the
life
of
an
old
grizzly
because
they
thought
it
housed
the
soul
of
a
dead
grandam
whose
withered
features
had
borne
some
likeness
to
the
wrinkled
face
of
the
bear
the
doctrine
of
the
transmigration
of
human
souls
into
animal
bodies
is
viewed
with
great
favour
by
the
negroes
of
northern
guinea
in
different
parts
of
the
coast
different
species
of
animals
are
accounted
sacred
because
they
are
supposed
to
be
animated
by
the
spirits
of
the
dead
hence
monkeys
near
fishtown
snakes
at
whydah
and
crocodiles
near
dix
cove
live
in
the
odour
of
sanctity
in
the
lagoon
of
tendo
on
the
ivory
coast
of
west
africa
there
is
a
certain
sacred
islet
covered
with
impenetrable
scrub
on
which
no
native
dare
set
foot
it
is
peopled
only
by
countless
huge
bats
which
at
evening
quit
the
island
by
hundreds
of
thousands
to
fly
towards
the
river
tanoe
which
flows
into
the
lagoon
the
natives
say
that
these
bats
are
the
souls
of
the
dead
who
retire
during
the
day
to
the
holy
isle
and
are
bound
to
present
themselves
every
night
at
the
abode
of
tano
the
great
and
good
fetish
who
dwells
by
the
river
of
his
name
paddling
past
the
island
the
negroes
will
not
look
at
it
but
turn
away
their
heads
a
european
in
crossing
the
lagoon
wished
to
shoot
one
of
the
bats
but
his
boatmen
implored
him
to
refrain
lest
he
should
kill
the
soul
of
one
of
their
kinsfolk
in
the
mopane
country
of
south
africa
there
is
or
used
to
be
no
check
on
the
increase
of
lions
because
the
natives
believing
that
the
souls
of
their
chiefs
entered
into
the
animals
never
attempted
to
kill
them
on
the
contrary
whenever
they
met
a
lion
they
saluted
him
in
the
usual
fashion
by
clapping
their
hands
hence
the
country
was
so
infested
by
lions
that
people
benighted
in
fields
often
slept
for
safety
in
trees
similarly
the
makanga
who
occupy
the
angle
between
the
zambesi
and
shire
rivers
refrain
from
killing
lions
because
they
believe
that
the
spirits
of
dead
chiefs
enter
into
them
the
amambwe
universally
suppose
that
their
reigning
chief
turns
at
death
into
a
lion
the
bahima
of
ankole
in
central
africa
also
imagine
that
their
dead
kings
are
changed
into
lions
their
corpses
are
carried
to
a
forest
called
ensanzi
where
they
lie
in
state
for
several
days
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
body
is
supposed
to
burst
and
give
forth
a
lion
cub
which
contains
the
spirit
of
the
deceased
king
the
animal
is
nurtured
by
priests
till
it
is
grown
up
when
it
is
released
and
allowed
to
roam
the
forest
with
the
other
lions
it
is
the
duty
of
the
priests
to
feed
and
care
for
the
lions
and
to
hold
communications
with
the
dead
kings
when
occasion
arises
for
that
purpose
the
priests
always
live
in
a
temple
in
the
forest
where
they
receive
frequent
offerings
of
cattle
for
the
lions
in
this
forest
the
lions
are
sacred
and
may
not
be
killed
but
in
other
parts
of
the
country
they
may
be
slaughtered
with
impunity
similarly
the
bahima
think
that
at
death
the
king
s
wives
are
changed
into
leopards
the
transformation
takes
place
in
like
manner
through
the
bursting
of
the
dead
bodies
in
a
belt
of
the
same
sacred
forest
there
the
leopards
are
daily
fed
with
offerings
of
meat
by
priests
whose
office
is
hereditary
further
the
bahima
are
of
opinion
that
the
spirits
of
dead
princes
and
princesses
come
to
life
again
in
the
form
of
snakes
which
burst
from
their
dead
bodies
in
another
belt
of
the
same
forest
there
is
a
temple
in
the
forest
where
priests
feed
and
guard
the
holy
serpents
when
the
little
snakes
have
issued
from
the
corpses
of
the
princes
they
are
fed
with
milk
till
they
are
big
enough
to
go
alone
the
el
kiboron
clan
of
the
masai
in
east
africa
imagine
that
when
married
men
of
the
clan
are
buried
their
bones
turn
into
serpents
hence
the
el
kiboron
do
not
like
the
other
masai
kill
snakes
on
the
contrary
they
are
glad
to
see
the
reptiles
in
the
kraal
and
set
out
saucers
of
milk
and
honey
for
them
on
the
ground
it
is
said
that
snakes
never
bite
members
of
the
clan
the
ababu
and
other
tribes
of
the
congo
region
believe
that
at
death
their
souls
transmigrate
into
the
bodies
of
various
animals
such
as
the
hippopotamus
the
leopard
the
gorilla
and
the
gazelle
and
on
no
account
would
a
man
eat
the
flesh
of
an
animal
of
the
particular
kind
which
he
expects
to
inhabit
in
the
next
life
some
of
the
caffres
of
the
zambesi
region
in
portuguese
territory
who
believe
in
the
transmigration
of
human
souls
into
the
bodies
of
animals
judge
of
the
species
of
animals
into
which
a
dead
person
has
transmigrated
by
the
resemblance
which
he
bore
to
it
in
his
life
thus
the
soul
of
a
big
burly
man
with
prominent
teeth
will
pass
into
an
elephant
a
strong
man
with
a
long
beard
will
become
a
lion
an
ugly
man
with
a
large
mouth
and
thick
lips
will
be
a
hyaena
and
so
on
animals
supposed
to
be
tenanted
by
the
spirits
of
the
dead
are
treated
as
sacred
and
invulnerable
when
a
portuguese
lady
named
dona
maria
to
whom
the
blacks
were
much
attached
had
departed
this
life
it
chanced
that
a
hyaena
came
repeatedly
by
night
to
the
village
and
carried
off
pigs
and
kids
the
lady
s
old
slaves
would
not
do
the
creature
the
smallest
hurt
saying
it
is
dona
maria
our
good
mistress
she
is
hungry
and
comes
to
her
house
seeking
what
she
may
the
belief
that
the
souls
of
the
dead
transmigrate
into
the
bodies
of
animals
appears
to
be
widely
diffused
among
the
tribes
of
madagascar
thus
for
example
the
souls
of
the
betsileo
are
thought
after
death
to
be
reborn
in
crocodiles
and
eels
of
a
particular
sort
according
to
their
rank
in
life
it
is
the
nobles
or
at
all
events
the
most
illustrious
of
them
who
have
the
privilege
of
turning
into
at
death
to
facilitate
the
transformation
the
corpse
of
a
dead
noble
is

long

the

into

he
appeared
to
his

that
the
souls
of

inhabit
the

of
certain
animals
such
as
serpents
crocodiles
and
so
forth
the
kind
of
animal
varying
with
the
family
the
species
of
animals
most
commonly
regarded
as
tenanted
by
the
spirits
of
the
departed
are
the
rodents
and
active
climbing
creatures
which
abound
in
the
country
such
as
squirrels
according
to
some
people
these
small
animals
are
especially
the
abode
of
infants
or
of
children
who
died
young
the
souls
of
these
little
ones
appear

to

and
so
on
the

discharge
this
pious
duty
respect
these
familiar
spirits
ascribe
illnesses
to
their
displeasure
pray
to
them
for
healing
and
on
their
deathbed
commend
to
their
descendants
the
care
of
such
and
such
a
spirit
as
a
member
of
the
family
the
igorrots
of
cabugatan
in
the
philippines
regard
the
eels
in
their
stream
as
the
souls
of
their
forefathers
hence
instead
of
catching
and
eating
them
they
feed
them
till
the
eels
become
as
tame
as
carp
in
a
pond
in
the
sandwich
islands
various
people
worshipped
diverse
kinds
of
animals
such
as
fowls
lizards
owls
rats
and
so
forth
if
a
man
who
adored
sharks
happened
to
have
a
child
he
would
endeavour
to
lodge
the
soul
of
the
dead
infant
in
the
body
of
a
shark
for
this
purpose
he
laid
the
tiny
body
together
with
a
couple
of
roots
of
taro
some
kava
and
a
piece
of
on
a
mat
recited
prayers
over
it
and
then
flung
the
whole
into
the
sea
believing
that
by
virtue
of
this
offering
the
transmigration
of
the
child
s
soul
into
the
shark
s
body
would
be
effected
and
that
henceforth
the
voracious
monsters
would
spare
all
members
of
the
family
who
might
otherwise
be
exposed
to
their
attacks
in
the
temples
dedicated
to
sharks
there
were
priests
who
morning
and
evening
addressed
prayers
to
the
and
rubbed
their
bodies
with
water
and
salt
which
drying
on
their
skin
imparted
to
it
an
appearance
of
being
covered
with
scales
they
also
wore
red
stuffs
uttered
shrill
cries
leaped
over
the
sacred
enclosure
and
persuaded
the
credulous
islanders
that
they
knew
the
exact
moment
when
the
children
thrown
into
the
sea
were
turned
into
sharks
for
this
revelation
they
were
rewarded
by
the
happy
parents
with
a
plentiful
supply
of
little
pigs
kava
and
so
on
the
pelew
islanders
believed
that
the
souls
of
their
forefathers
lived
in
certain
species
of
animals
which
accordingly
they
held
sacred
and
would
not
injure
for
this
reason
one
man
would
not
kill
snakes
another
would
not
harm
pigeons
and
so
on
but
every
one
was
quite
ready
to
kill
and
eat
the
sacred
animals
of
his
neighbours
we
have
seen
that
the
battas
of
sumatra
seldom
kill
a
tiger
and
never
without
performing
an
elaborate
ceremony
to
appease
the
animal
s
ghost
the
reason
alleged
for
treating
tigers
with
this
respect
is
that
the
souls
of
the
dead
often
transmigrate
into
these
animals
and
therefore
in
killing
a
tiger
a
man
never
knows
whether
he
is
not
killing
a
relative
of
his
own
if
members
of
the
totemic
clan
of
the
tiger
should
happen
to
be
in
a
village
when
the
carcase
of
a
slain
tiger
is
brought
into
it
they
are
bound
to
pay
special
marks
of
honour
to
its
remains
by
putting
betel
in
its
mouth
a
priest
offers
food
and
drink
to
the
dead
tiger
addresses
him
as
grandfather
prays
him
not
to
be
angry
or
frightened
and
explains
to
the
gods
the
reasons
for
putting
the
animal
to
death
the
kayans
of
borneo
think
that
when
the
human
soul
departs
from
the
body
at
death
it
may
take
the
form
of
an
animal
or
bird
for
example
if
a
deer
were
seen
browsing
near
a
man
s
grave
his
relations
would
probably
conclude
that
his
soul
had
assumed
the
shape
of
a
deer
and
the
whole
family
would
abstain
from
eating
venison
lest
they
should
annoy
the
deceased
most
of
the
kalamantans
another
tribe
of
borneo
will
kill
and
eat
deer
freely
but
there
are
exceptions
to
the
rule
thus
damong
the
chief
of
a
malanau
household
together
with
all
his
people
will
not
kill
or
eat
the
deer
alleging
that
an
ancestor
had
become
a
deer
of
this
kind
and
that
since
they
can
not
distinguish
this
incarnation
of
his
ancestor
from
other
deer
they
must
abstain
from
killing
all
deer
of
this
species
we
know
of
one
instance
in
which
one
of
these
people
refused
to
use
again
his
which
a
malay
had
borrowed
and
used
for
cooking
the
flesh
of
this
deer
this
superstition
is
still
rigidly
adhered
to
although
these
people
have
been
converted
to
islam
of
recent
years
the
people
of
miri
who
also
are
mohammedan
malanaus
claim
to
be
related
to
the
large
deer
and
some
of
them
to
the
muntjac
deer
also
now
these
people
live
in
a
country
in
which
deer
of
all
kinds
abound
and
they
always
make
a
clearing
in
the
jungle
around
a
tomb
on
such
a
clearing
grass
grows
up
rapidly
and
so
the
spot
becomes
attractive
to
deer
as
a
grazing
ground
and
it
seems
not
improbable
that
it
is
through
frequently
seeing
deer
about
the
tombs
that
the
people
have
come
to
entertain
the
belief
that
their
dead
relatives
become
deer
or
that
they
are
in
some
other
way
closely
related
to
the
deer
the
bakongs
another
group
of
malanaus
hold
a
similar
belief
with
regard
to
the
and
the
various
species
of
and
in
this
case
the
origin
of
the
belief
is
admitted
by
them
to
be
the
fact
that
on
going
to
their
graveyards
they
often
see
one
of
these
beasts
coming
out
of
a
tomb
these
tombs
are
roughly
constructed
wooden
coffins
raised
a
few
feet
only
from
the
ground
and
it
is
probable
that
these
carnivores
make
their
way
into
them
in
the
first
place
to
devour
the
corpse
and
that
they
then
make
use
of
them
as
among
the
sea
dyaks
also
of
borneo
the
idea
of
metempsychosis
is
not
unknown
one
of
them
used
to
treat
a
snake
with
the
greatest
kindness
because
he
said
it
had
been
revealed
to
him
in
a
dream
that
the
spirit
of
his
grandfather
dwelt
in
that
snake
some
of
the
papuans
on
the
northern
coast
of
new
guinea
also
believe
in
the
transmigration
of
souls
they
hold
that
at
death
the
souls
of
human
beings
sometimes
pass
into
animals
such
as
cassowaries
fish
or
pigs
and
they
abstain
from
eating
the
animals
of
the
sort
in
which
the
spirits
of
the
dead
are
supposed
to
have
taken
up
their
abode
for
example
at
masur
in
dutch
new
guinea
there
are
people
who
imagine
that
the
spirits
of
their
ancestors
transmigrated
into
cassowaries
and
accordingly
they
will
not
partake
of
the
flesh
of
the
bird
in
simbang
a
village
at
the
mouth
of
the
bubui
river
in
german
new
guinea
there
is
a
family
who
will
not
harm
crocodiles
not
merely
because
they
fear
the
vengeance
of
the
creatures
but
also
because
they
reckon
crocodiles
their
kinsfolk
and
expect
that
they
themselves
will
turn
into
crocodiles
at
death
as
head
of
the
family
they
recognise
a
certain
aged
crocodile
everywhere
known
as
old
butong
who
is
said
to
have
been
born
of
a
woman
at
simbang
they
think
that
while
they
are
at
work
in
the
fields
and
the
houses
stand
empty
their
ancestors
come
forth
from
the
river
and
repair
to
the
place
in
the
roof
where
the
mysterious
are
kept
which
make
a
humming
sound
at
the
initiatory
rites
of
young
men
but
when
the
people
return
from
the
fields
they
find
the
houses
as
empty
and
silent
as
when
they
left
them
the
spirits
of
their
forefathers
have
plunged
into
the
river
again
if
a
crocodile
carries
off
anybody
the
natives
are
sure
that
the
brute
must
be
a
stranger
not
one
of
their
own
crocodile
kinsfolk
who
never
would
do
such
a
thing
and
if
their
neighbours
at
yabim
are
so
unfeeling
as
to
kill
a
crocodile
the
bubui
people
protest
against
the
outrage
and
demand
satisfaction
some
yabim
people
give
out
that
after
death
their
souls
will
be
turned
into
certain
fabulous
swine
and
accordingly
their
relatives
refuse
to
spear
or
to
eat
the
real
wild
swine
if
these
animals
break
into
and
ravage
the
fields
their
human
kinsfolk
attempt
to
appease
them
with
offerings
of
and
other
valuable
articles
similarly
in
tamara
an
island
off
the
coast
of
german
new
guinea
the
people
will
not
eat
pork
because
it
is
their
conviction
that
the
souls
of
the
dead
transmigrate
into
the
bodies
of
pigs
the
kai
people
who
inhabit
the
rugged
and
densely
wooded
mountains
inland
from
finsch
harbour
in
german
new
guinea
imagine
that
the
gloomy
depths
of
some
wild
ravines
are
haunted
by
the
souls
of
the
dead
in
the
form
of
cuscuses
and
other
animals
none
but
the
owner
has
the
right
to
kill
game
in
these
dark
and
awful
gullies
and
even
he
must
propitiate
the
soul
of
every
animal
that
he
slays
in
such
a
spot
for
this
purpose
he
spreads
out
offerings
on
the
carcase
and
presents
them
to
the
injured
spirit
saying
take
the
gifts
and
leave
us
the
animal
that
we
may
eat
after
leaving
the
articles
long
enough
to
allow
the
soul
of
the
beast
to
abstract
and
convey
away
the
souls
of
the
things
the
hunter
is
free
to
cut
up
and
consume
the
carcase
some
years
ago
when
heavy
rains
caused
a
in
these
wild
mountains
and
a
house
with
its
inmates
was
buried
in
the
ruins
public
opinion
in
the
neighbourhood
attributed
the
disaster
to
the
misconduct
of
the
deceased
who
had
failed
to
appease
the
soul
of
a
slain
by
them
on
haunted
ground
in
the
solomon
islands
a
man
at
the
point
of
death
would
gather
the
members
of
his
family
about
him
and
inform
them
of
the
particular
sort
of
creature
say
a
bird
or
a
butterfly
into
which
he
proposed
to
transmigrate
henceforth
the
family
would
regard
that
species
of
animal
as
sacred
and
would
neither
kill
nor
injure
it
if
they
fell
in
with
a
creature
of
the
kind
it
might
be
a
bird
or
a
butterfly
they
would
say
that

and
offer
him

sharks
are
very
often
supposed
to
be
ghosts
for
dying
people
frequently
announce
their
intention
of
being
sharks
when
they
have
put
off
their
human
shape
after
that
if
any
shark
remarkable
for
its
size
or
colour
is
seen
to
haunt
a
certain
shore
or
rock
it
is
taken
to
be
somebody
s
ghost
and
the
name
of
the
deceased
is
given
to
it
for
example
at
ulawa
a
dreaded
shark
received
the
name
of
a
dead
man
and
was
propitiated
with
offerings
of
porpoise

men

it
is
positively
known
that
after
death
they
will
be
in

are
allowed
by
anticipation
to
partake
of

the
sacred
place

will
sometimes
join
themselves

if
such
a

happens
to
be
really
possessed

power
he
will
in
due
time
become
a

but
it
is
perfectly
possible
that
he
may
fail
in
savo
not
very
long
ago
a
certain
man
had
a
shark
that
he
used
to
feed
and
to
which
he
offered
sacrifice
he
swam
out
to
it
with
food
called
it
by
name
and
it
came
to
him
of
course
it
was
not
a
common
shark
but
a
ghost

knowledge
of
which
had
been
handed
down
to
him
from
his
ancestors

may
lodge
the
souls
of
dead
solomon
islanders
in
the
island
of

a
story
was
told
of
an
alligator
that
used
to
come
up
out
of
the
sea
and
make
itself
quite
at
home
in
the
village
in
which
the
man
whose
ghost
it
was
had
lived
it
went
by
the
name
of
the
deceased
and
though
there
was
one
man
in
particular
who
had
special
connexion
with
it
and
was
said
to
own
it
the
animal
was
on
friendly
terms
with
everybody
in
the
place
and
would
even
let
children
ride
on
its
back
but
the
village
where
this
happened
has
not
yet
been
identified
in
the
same
island
the
appearance
of
anything
wonderful
is
taken
as
proof
of
a
ghostly
presence
and
stamps
the
place
as
sacred
for
example
a
man
planted
some
palms
and
almond
trees
in
the
bush
and
died
not
long
afterwards
after
his
death
there
appeared
among
the
trees
a
great
rarity
in
the
shape
of
a
white
cuscus
the
animal
was
accordingly
assumed
to
be
the
ghost
of
the
departed
planter
and
went
by
his
name
the
place
became
sacred
and
no
one
would
gather
the
fruits
of
the
trees
there
until
two
young
men
who
had
been
trained
in
the
principles
of
christianity
boldly
invaded
the
sanctuary
and
appropriated
the
almonds
and
it
must
not
be
supposed
however
that
the
choice
of
transmigration
open
to
a
solomon
islander
is
restricted
to
the
animal
kingdom
he
is
free
after
death
to
become
a
vegetable
if
he
feels
so
disposed
when
a
was
established
in
the
island
of
ulawa
it
was
observed
with
surprise
that
the
natives
would
not
eat
bananas
and
had
ceased
to
plant
the
tree
enquiry
elicited
the
origin
of
the
restriction
which
was
recent
and
well
remembered
a
man
of
great
influence
dying
not
long
before
had
forbidden
the
eating
of
bananas
after
his
death
saying
that
he
would
be
in
the
banana
the
older
natives
would
still
mention
his
name
and
say
we
can
not
eat
the
doctrine
of
the
reincarnation
of
human
souls
in
the
bodies
either
of
men
or
of
animals
which
meets
us
as
an
article
of
faith
in
so
many
savage
tribes
has
a
special
interest
for
the
historian
of
thought
because
it
has
been
adopted
more
or
less
explicitly
and
employed
not
merely
as
a
philosophical
theory
but
as
a
means
of
enforcing
moral
lessons
by
thinkers
teachers
and
lawgivers
among
various
civilised
peoples
notably
in
ancient
india
and
greece
thus
in
the
most
famous
of
old
indian
laws
of
the
penalties
to
be
endured
by
in
future
births
are
described
with
a
precision
which
leaves
nothing
to
be
desired
the
degradation
of
the
birth
is
exactly
proportioned
to
the
degree
of
moral
guilt
of
the
transgressor
for
example
if
a
man
has
the
temerity
to
censure
his
teacher
even
though
the
censure
is
richly
deserved
that
rash
man
in
his
next
birth
will
be
an
ass
but
if
he
defames
his
teacher
falsely
he
will
be
a
dog
and
if
he
is
so
lost
to
all
sense
of
propriety
as
to
live
at
the
expense
of
his
teacher
he
will
be
a
worm
a
faithless
wife
in
her
next
transmigration
will
be
born
a
jackal
a
brahman
who
misappropriates
money
which
he
has
received
for
a
sacrifice
will
hereafter
be
either
a
vulture
or
a
crow
for
the
period
of
one
hundred
years
men
who
delight
in
doing
hurt
will
be
born
as
carnivorous
animals
and
those
who
eat
forbidden
food
will
be
degraded
into
worms
as
for
thieves
their
lot
is
a
hard
one
and
it
is
harder
in
proportion
to
the
value
of
the
article
stolen
a
man
who
steals
gems
will
be
born
a
goldsmith
a
man
who
steals
grain
will
be
born
a
rat
a
man
who
steals
honey
will
be
born
a
stinging
insect
and
a
man
who
steals
clarified
butter
will
be
born
an
ichneumon
the
penalty
for
stealing
silk
is
to
become
a
partridge
for
stealing
linen
a
frog
for
stealing
vegetables
a
peacock
for
stealing
cooked
food
a
porcupine
for
stealing
uncooked
food
a
hedgehog
and
for
stealing
molasses
a
and
so
on
for
the
various
degrees
of
moral
turpitude
throughout
the
entire
range
of
the
animal
kingdom
buddha
himself
who
gave
an
immense
extension
to
the
doctrine
of
transmigration
by
incorporating
it
in
his
religious
or
rather
philosophical
system
is
traditionally
said
to
have
undergone
many
animal
births
of
various
sorts
before
he
attained
to
his
supreme
dignity
thus
it
is
reported
that
he
was
once
a
hare
once
a
dog
twice
a
pig
twice
a
frog
four
times
a
serpent
six
times
a
snipe
ten
times
a
lion
eleven
times
a
deer
and
eighteen
times
a
monkey
to
say
nothing
of
having
been
once
a
twice
a
thief
times
an
ascetic
and
so
on
in
ancient
greece
also
the
theory
of
the
transmigration
of
souls
found
favour
with
the
early
philosophers
pythagoras
and
empedocles
both
of
whom
if
we
may
trust
tradition
appealed
to
their
own
personal
experience
in
support
of
the
doctrine
according
to
ancient
writers
pythagoras
affirmed
that
he
had
been
euphorbus
the
trojan
in
one
of
his
former
lives
and
in
proof
of
the
assertion
he
identified
the
shield
of
euphorbus
among
the
trojan
spoils
at
mycenae
he
would
seem
to
have
held
that
human
souls
can
transmigrate
into
animals
or
even
into
plants
and
we
may
suppose
that
the
possibility
of
such
transmigrations
was
at
least
one
of
the
reasons
he
alleged
for
enjoining
the
strictest
of
his
disciples
neither
to
kill
nor
to
eat
animals
and
to
abstain
from
certain
vegetables
such
as
beans
and
mallows
certainly
at
a
later
time
these
principles
were
maintained
and
these
precepts
inculcated
by
empedocles
who
outdid
the
reminiscences
of
his
predecessor
by
asserting
that
he
himself
in
former
lives
had
been
a
boy
a
girl
a
bush
a
bird
and
a
fish
hence
he
denounced
as
a
crime
the
practice
of
killing
and
eating
animals
since
according
to
him
a
man
could
never
know
but
that
in
slaughtering
and
eating
an
animal
he
might
be
murdering
and
devouring
one
of
his
dead
kinsfolk
it
might
be
his
father
or
mother
his
son
or
daughter
thus
from
the
doctrine
of
transmigration
empedocles
logically
drew
the
same
practical
conclusion
as
the
savage
who
abstains
for
example
from
killing
and
eating
crocodiles
or
pigs
because
he
believes
the
souls
of
his
departed
relations
to
be
embodied
in
crocodiles
or
pigs
the
only
important
difference
between
the
savage
and
the
philosopher
in
this
respect
is
that
whereas
the
savage
venerates
and
spares
only
animals
of
one
particular
species
on
the
ground
of
their
possible
affinity
to
himself
the
philosopher
on
his
own
shewing
was
bound
to
abstain
from
all
animals
whatever
since
according
to
him
the
spirits
of
his
deceased
relatives
might
be
lurking
in
creatures
of
any
species
hence
while
a
faith
in
transmigration
imposes
but
few
restrictions
on
the
diet
of
a
savage
since
it
leaves
him
free
to
partake
of
the
flesh
of
every
sort
of
animals
but
one
the
creed
of
empedocles
logically
cut
him
off
from
a
flesh
diet
altogether
and
compelled
him
to
live
on
vegetables
alone
indeed
if
he
had
been
rigidly
logical
he
must
have
denied
himself
the
use
of
vegetables
also
and
perished
of
hunger
since
on
his
theory
vegetables
as
well
as
animals
may
house
the
souls
of
the
dead
however
like
a
wise
man
he
sacrificed
logic
to
life
and
contented
himself
with
forbidding
his
disciples
the
use
of
a
few
vegetables
such
as
beans
and
laurels
while
he
suffered
them
to
browse
freely
on
all
the
rest
so
far
as
we
can
gather
the
real
opinions
of
pythagoras
and
empedocles
from
the
traditional
history
of
the
one
and
the
miserably
mutilated
writings
of
the
other
they
seem
both
like
buddha
with
whom
they
had
much
in
common
to
have
used
the
old
savage
doctrine
of
the
transmigration
of
souls
mainly
as
a
handle
by
which
to
impress
on
the
minds
of
their
followers
the
necessity
of
leading
an
innocent
pure
and
even
ascetic
life
in
this
world
as
the
only
means
of
ensuring
a
blissful
or
at
all
events
an
untroubled
eternity
in
a
world
to
come
at
least
this
is
fairly
certain
for
empedocles
whose
views
are
comparatively
well
known
to
us
through
the
fragments
of
his
philosophical
writings
from
these
utterances
of
his
the
genuineness
of
which
seems
to
be
beyond
suspicion
we
gather
that
the
psychology
of
empedocles
was
a
curious
blend
of
savagery
and
mysticism
he
regarded
the
incarnation
of
the
human
soul
in
a
body
of
any
sort
as
a
punishment
for
sin
a
degradation
a
fall
from
heaven
an
exile
from
god
a
banishment
from
a
world
of
bliss
to
a
world
of
woe
he
describes
the
earth
as
a
cavern
a
joyless
land
where
men
wander
in
darkness
a
prey
to
murder
and
revenge
to
swarms
of
foul
fiends
to
wasting
sickness
and
decay
he
speaks
with
pity
and
contempt
of
the
life
of
mortals
as
a
wretched
and
miserable
existence
begotten
of
strife
and
sighs
and
prolonged
as
a
punishment
for
their
sins
through
a
series
of
transmigrations
until
by
the
exercise
of
virtue
they
have
been
born
again
as
prophets
poets
physicians
and
princes
and
so
return
at
last
to
communion
with
the
gods
to
live
thenceforth
free
from
pain
and
sorrow
immortal
incorruptible
divine
this
view
of
human
destiny
this
passionate
scorn
poured
on
the
present
world
this
ecstatic
aspiration
after
a
blissful
eternity
the
reward
of
virtue
in
a
world
to
come
are
very
alien
from
the
cheerful
serenity
the
calm
rationalism
of
the
ordinary
greek
attitude
towards
existence
on
earth
in
his
profound
conviction
of
the
manifold
sufferings
inseparable
from
mortality
in
his
longing
to
put
off
the
burden
of
the
body
or
what
he
calls
the
garment
of
flesh
in
his
tenderness
for
the
lower
animals
and
his
strong
sense
of
kinship
with
them
empedocles
resembled
buddha
whose
whole
cast
of
thought
however
was
tinged
with
a
still
deeper
shade
of
melancholy
a
more
hopeless
outlook
on
the
future
yet
so
close
in
some
respects
is
the
similarity
between
the
two
that
we
might
incline
to
suppose
a
direct
influence
of
buddhism
on
empedocles
were
it
not
that
the
dates
of
the
two
great
thinkers
so
far
as
they
can
be
ascertained
appear
to
exclude
the
supposition
but
if
on
its
ethical
side
the
teaching
of
empedocles
may
almost
be
described
as
buddhism
relieved
of
its
deepest
shadows
on
its
scientific
side
it
curiously
anticipated
some
speculations
which
have
deeply
stirred
the
european
mind
in
our
own
and
our
fathers
days
for
to
his
savage
psychology
and
religious
mysticism
empedocles
superadded
a
comprehensive
and
grandiose
theory
of
the
material
universe
which
presents
a
close
analogy
to
that
of
herbert
spencer
the
scientific
doctrine
of
the
conservation
of
energy
or
as
he
preferred
to
call
it
the
persistence
of
force
which
spencer
made
the
of
his
system
has
its
counterpart
in
the
empedoclean
doctrine
of
the
conservation
or
indestructibility
of
matter
the
sum
of
which
according
to
him
remains
always
constant
never
undergoing
either
increase
or
diminution
hence
all
the
changes
that
take
place
in
the
physical
world
according
to
empedocles
resolve
themselves
into
the
integration
and
disintegration
of
matter
the
composition
and
decomposition
of
bodies
brought
about
by
the
two
antagonistic
forces
of
attraction
and
repulsion
which
in
mythical
language
he
called
love
and
hate
and
just
as
all
particular
things
are
evolved
by
the
force
of
attraction
and
dissolved
by
the
force
of
repulsion
a
state
of
concentration
or
aggregation
in
the
individual
perpetually
alternating
with
a
state
of
diffusion
or
segregation
so
it
is
also
with
the
material
universe
as
a
whole
it
too
alternately
contracts
and
expands
according
as
the
forces
of
attraction
and
repulsion
alternately
prevail
for
it
was
the
opinion
of
empedocles
that
a
long
perhaps
immeasurable
period
of
time
during
which
the
force
of
attraction
prevails
over
the
force
of
repulsion
is
succeeded
by
an
equally
long
period
in
which
the
force
of
repulsion
prevails
over
the
force
of
attraction
each
period
lasting
till
the
predominant
force
being
spent
its
action
is
first
arrested
and
then
reversed
by
the
opposite
force
so
that
the
material
universe
performs
a
periodic
and
rhythmic
movement
of
alternate
contraction
and
expansion
which
never
ceases
except
at
the
moments
when
the
two
opposite
forces
exactly
balancing
each
other
all
things
come
to
rest
and
equilibrium
for
a
time
only
however
to
return
with
the
backward
sweep
of
the
cosmic
pendulum
to
their
former
state
either
of
consolidation
or
of
dispersion
thus
under
the
influence
of
attraction
and
repulsion
matter
is
constantly
oscillating
to
and
fro
at
the
end
of
a
period
of
contraction
it
is
gathered
up
in
a
solid
globe
at
the
end
of
a
period
of
expansion
it
is
diffused
throughout
space
in
a
state
of
tenuity
which
nowadays
we
might
describe
as
gaseous
and
this
gigantic
motion
of
the
universe
as
a
whole
has
gone
on
and
will
go
on
for
ever
and
ever
the
imposing
generalisation
thus
formulated
by
empedocles
in
the
fifth
century
before
our
era
was
enunciated
independently
in
the
nineteenth
century
of
our
era
by
herbert
spencer
like
his
greek
predecessor
the
modern
english
philosopher
held
that
the
material
universe
passes
through
alternate
periods
of
concentration
and
dissipation
of
evolution
and
dissolution
according
as
the
forces
of
attraction
and
repulsion
alternately
prevail
the
terms
in
which
he
sums
up
his
general
conclusions
might
be
used
with
hardly
any
change
to
describe
the
conclusions
of
empedocles
for
the
sake
of
comparison
it
may
be
well
to
subjoin
the
passage
it
runs
as
follows
thus
we
are
led
to
the
conclusion
that
the
entire
process
of
things
as
displayed
in
the
aggregate
of
the
visible
universe
is
analogous
to
the
entire
process
of
things
as
displayed
in
the
smallest
aggregates
motion
as
well
as
matter
being
fixed
in
quantity
it
would
seem
that
the
change
in
the
distribution
of
matter
which
motion
effects
coming
to
a
limit
in
whichever
direction
it
is
carried
the
indestructible
motion
thereupon
necessitates
a
reverse
distribution
apparently
the
universally
coexistent
forces
of
attraction
and
repulsion
which
as
we
have
seen
necessitate
rhythm
in
all
minor
changes
throughout
the
universe
also
necessitate
rhythm
in
the
totality
of
its
now
an
immeasurable
period
during
which
the
attractive
forces
predominating
cause
universal
concentration
and
then
an
immeasurable
period
during
which
the
repulsive
forces
predominating
cause
universal
eras
of
evolution
and
dissolution
and
thus
there
is
suggested
the
conception
of
a
past
during
which
there
have
been
successive
evolutions
analogous
to
that
which
is
now
going
on
and
a
future
during
which
successive
other
such
evolutions
may
go
the
same
in
principle
but
never
the
same
in
concrete
the
most
recent
researches
in
physical
science
tend
apparently
rather
to
confirm
than
to
invalidate
these
general
views
of
the
nature
of
the
universe
for
if
modern
physicists
are
right
in
regarding
the
constitution
of
matter
as
essentially
electrical
the
antagonistic
forces
of
attraction
and
repulsion
postulated
by
empedocles
and
spencer
would
resolve
themselves
into
positive
and
negative
electricity
on
the
other
hand
the
atomic
disintegration
which
is
now
known
to
be
proceeding
in
certain
of
the
chemical
elements
particularly
in
uranium
and
radium
and
which
is
probably
proceeding
in
all
suggests
a
doubt
whether
the
universe
is
really
as
spencer
supposed
in
process
of
integration
and
evolution
and
not
rather
in
process
of
disintegration
and
dissolution
or
whether
perhaps
the
apparent
evolution
of
the
organic
world
is
not
attended
by
a
simultaneous
dissolution
of
the
inorganic
so
that
the
fabric
of
the
universe
would
be
a
sort
of
penelope
s
web
which
the
great
artificer
weaves
and
unweaves
at
the
same
time
with
such
a
grave
doubt
to
trouble
the
outlook
on
the
future
we
may
perhaps
say
that
empedocles
was
wiser
than
herbert
spencer
in
leaving
as
he
apparently
did
the
question
undecided
whether
during
the
epoch
open
to
human
observation
the
force
of
attraction
or
that
of
repulsion
has
been
and
is
predominant
and
consequently
whether
matter
as
a
whole
is
integrating
or
disintegrating
whether
all
things
are
gradually
evolving
into
more
complex
and
concentrated
forms
or
are
gradually
dissolving
and
wasting
away
through
simpler
and
simpler
forms
into
the
diffused
tenuity
of
their
primordial
constituents
just
as
in
his
view
of
the
constitution
and
history
of
the
physical
universe
empedocles
anticipated
to
some
extent
the
theories
of
spencer
so
in
his
view
of
the
development
of
living
beings
he
anticipated
to
some
extent
the
theories
of
darwin
for
he
held
that
the
existing
species
of
animals
have
been
evolved
out
of
inorganic
matter
through
intermediate
sorts
of
monstrous
creatures
which
being
ill
fitted
to
survive
gradually
succumbed
and
were
exterminated
in
the
struggle
for
existence
whether
empedocles
himself
clearly
enunciated
the
principle
of
the
survival
of
the
fittest
as
well
as
the
doctrine
of
evolution
we
can
not
say
with
certainty
but
at
all
events
it
is
significant
that
aristotle
after
stating
for
the
first
time
the
principle
of
the
survival
of
the
fittest
illustrates
it
by
a
reference
to
empedocles
s
theory
of
the
extinction
of
monstrous
forms
in
the
past
as
if
he
understood
the
theory
to
imply
the
principle
it
is
a
remarkable
instance
of
the
strange
complexities
and
seeming
inconsistencies
of
human
nature
that
a
man
whose
capacious
mind
revolved
ideas
so
and
fruitful
should
have
posed
among
his
contemporaries
as
a
prophet
or
even
as
a
god
parading
the
streets
of
his
native
city
bedecked
with
garlands
and
ribbons
and
followed
by
obsequious
crowds
of
men
and
women
who
worshipped
him
and
prayed
to
him
that
he
would
reveal
to
them
the
better
way
that
he
would
give
them
oracles
and
heal
their
infirmities
in
the
character
of
empedocles
as
in
that
of
another
forerunner
of
science
paracelsus
the
sterling
qualities
of
the
genuine
student
would
seem
to
have
been
alloyed
with
a
vein
of
ostentation
and
braggadocio
but
the
dash
of
the
mountebank
which
we
may
detect
in
his
composition
probably
helped
rather
than
hindered
him
to
win
for
a
time
the
favour
and
catch
the
ear
of
the
multitude
ever
ready
as
they
are
to
troop
at
the
heels
of
any
quack
who
advertises
his
wares
by
a
loud
blast
on
a
brazen
trumpet
with
so
many
claims
on
the
admiration
of
the
wise
and
the
adulation
of
the
foolish
we
may
almost
wonder
that
empedocles
did
not
become
the
founder
if
not
the
god
of
a
new
religion
certainly
other
human
deities
have
set
up
in
business
and
prospered
with
an
intellectual
much
inferior
to
that
of
the
sicilian
philosopher
perhaps
empedocles
lacked
that
perfect
sincerity
of
belief
in
his
own
pretensions
without
which
it
seems
difficult
or
impossible
permanently
to
impose
on
the
credulity
of
mankind
to
delude
others
successfully
it
is
desirable
if
not
absolutely
necessary
to
begin
by
being
one
s
self
deluded
and
the
sicilian
sage
was
probably
too
shrewd
a
man
to
feel
perfectly
at
ease
in
the
character
of
a
god
the
old
savage
doctrine
of
the
transmigration
of
souls
which
empedocles
furbished
up
and
passed
off
on
his
disciples
as
a
philosophical
tenet
was
afterwards
countenanced
if
not
expressly
affirmed
by
another
greek
philosopher
of
a
very
different
stamp
who
united
as
no
one
else
has
ever
done
in
the
same
degree
the
highest
capacity
for
abstract
thought
with
the
most
exquisite
literary
genius
but
if
he
borrowed
the
doctrine
from
savagery
plato
like
his
two
predecessors
detached
it
from
its
rude
original
setting
and
fitted
it
into
an
edifying
moral
scheme
of
retributive
justice
for
he
held
that
the
transmigration
of
human
souls
after
death
into
the
bodies
of
animals
is
a
punishment
or
degradation
entailed
on
the
souls
by
the
weaknesses
to
which
they
had
been
subject
or
the
vices
to
which
they
had
been
addicted
in
life
and
that
the
kind
of
animal
into
which
a
peccant
soul
transmigrates
is
appropriate
to
the
degree
and
nature
of
its
weakness
or
guilt
thus
for
example
the
souls
of
gluttons
sots
and
rakes
pass
into
the
bodies
of
asses
the
souls
of
robbers
and
tyrants
are
born
again
in
wolves
and
hawks
the
souls
of
sober
quiet
people
untinctured
by
philosophy
come
to
life
as
bees
and
ants
a
bad
poet
may
turn
at
death
into
a
swan
or
a
nightingale
and
a
bad
jester
into
an
ape
nothing
but
a
rigid
practice
of
the
highest
virtue
and
a
devotion
to
abstract
truth
will
avail
to
restore
such
degraded
souls
to
their
human
dignity
and
finally
raise
them
to
communion
with
the
gods
though
the
passages
in
which
these
views
are
set
forth
have
a
mythical
colouring
and
are
like
all
plato
s
writings
couched
in
dramatic
form
and
put
into
the
mouths
of
others
we
need
not
seriously
doubt
that
they
represent
the
real
opinion
of
the
philosopher
himself
it
is
interesting
and
instructive
to
meet
with
the
old
savage
theory
of
the
transmigration
of
souls
thus
masquerading
under
a
flowing
drapery
of
morality
and
sparkling
with
the
gems
of
attic
eloquence
in
the
philosophic
system
of
a
great
greek
thinker
so
curiously
alike
may
be
the
solutions
which
the
highest
and
the
lowest
intellects
offer
of
those
profound
problems
which
in
all
ages
have
engaged
the
curiosity
and
baffled
the
ingenuity
of
mankind
chapter
xvii
types
of
animal
sacrament
the
egyptian
and
the
aino
types
of
sacrament
we
are
now
perhaps
in
a
position
to
understand
the
ambiguous
behaviour
of
the
aino
and
gilyaks
towards
the
bear
it
has
been
shewn
that
the
sharp
line
of
demarcation
which
we
draw
between
mankind
and
the
lower
animals
does
not
exist
for
the
savage
to
him
many
of
the
other
animals
appear
as
his
equals
or
even
his
superiors
not
merely
in
brute
force
but
in
intelligence
and
if
choice
or
necessity
leads
him
to
take
their
lives
he
feels
bound
out
of
regard
to
his
own
safety
to
do
it
in
a
way
which
will
be
as
inoffensive
as
possible
not
merely
to
the
living
animal
but
to
its
departed
spirit
and
to
all
the
other
animals
of
the
same
species
which
would
resent
an
affront
put
upon
one
of
their
kind
much
as
a
tribe
of
savages
would
revenge
an
injury
or
insult
offered
to
a
tribesman
we
have
seen
that
among
the
many
devices
by
which
the
savage
seeks
to
atone
for
the
wrong
done
by
him
to
his
animal
victims
one
is
to
shew
marked
deference
to
a
few
chosen
individuals
of
the
species
for
such
behaviour
is
apparently
regarded
as
entitling
him
to
exterminate
with
impunity
all
the
rest
of
the
species
upon
which
he
can
lay
hands
this
principle
perhaps
explains
the
attitude
at
first
sight
puzzling
and
contradictory
of
the
aino
towards
the
bear
the
flesh
and
skin
of
the
bear
regularly
afford
them
food
and
clothing
but
since
the
bear
is
an
intelligent
and
powerful
animal
it
is
necessary
to
offer
some
satisfaction
or
atonement
to
the
bear
species
for
the
loss
which
it
sustains
in
the
death
of
so
many
of
its
members
this
satisfaction
or
atonement
is
made
by
rearing
young
bears
treating
them
so
long
as
they
live
with
respect
and
killing
them
with
extraordinary
marks
of
sorrow
and
devotion
so
the
other
bears
are
appeased
and
do
not
resent
the
slaughter
of
their
kind
by
attacking
the
slayers
or
deserting
the
country
which
would
deprive
the
aino
of
one
of
their
means
of
subsistence
thus
the
primitive
worship
of
animals
assumes
two
forms
which
are
in
some
respects
the
converse
of
each
other
on
the
one
hand
animals
are
worshipped
and
are
therefore
neither
killed
nor
eaten
on
the
other
hand
animals
are
worshipped
because
they
are
habitually
killed
and
eaten
in
both
forms
of
worship
the
animal
is
revered
on
account
of
some
benefit
positive
or
negative
which
the
savage
hopes
to
receive
from
it
in
the
former
worship
the
benefit
comes
either
in
the
positive
form
of
protection
advice
and
help
which
the
animal
affords
the
man
or
in
the
negative
one
of
abstinence
from
injuries
which
it
is
in
the
power
of
the
animal
to
inflict
in
the
latter
worship
the
benefit
takes
the
material
form
of
the
animal
s
flesh
and
skin
the
two
forms
of
worship
are
in
some
measure
antithetical
in
the
one
the
animal
is
not
eaten
because
it
is
revered
in
the
other
it
is
revered
because
it
is
eaten
but
both
may
be
practised
by
the
same
people
as
we
see
in
the
case
of
the
north
american
indians
who
while
they
apparently
revere
and
spare
their
totem
animals
also
revere
the
animals
and
fish
upon
which
they
subsist
the
aborigines
of
australia
have
totemism
in
the
most
primitive
form
known
to
us
but
so
far
as
i
am
aware
there
is
no
clear
evidence
that
they
attempt
like
the
north
american
indians
to
conciliate
the
animals
which
they
kill
and
eat
the
means
which
the
australians
adopt
to
secure
a
plentiful
supply
of
game
appear
to
be
primarily
based
not
on
conciliation
but
on
sympathetic
magic
a
principle
to
which
the
north
american
indians
also
resort
for
the
same
purpose
hence
as
the
australians
undoubtedly
represent
a
ruder
and
earlier
stage
of
human
progress
than
the
american
indians
it
would
seem
that
before
hunters
think
of
worshipping
the
game
as
a
means
of
ensuring
an
abundant
supply
of
it
they
seek
to
attain
the
same
end
by
sympathetic
magic
this
again
would
there
is
good
reason
for
sympathetic
magic
is
one
of
the
earliest
means
by
which
man
endeavours
to
adapt
the
agencies
of
nature
to
his
needs
corresponding
to
the
two
distinct
types
of
animal
worship
there
are
two
distinct
types
of
the
custom
of
killing
the
animal
god
on
the
one
hand
when
the
revered
animal
is
habitually
spared
it
is
nevertheless
sometimes
rare
and
solemn
occasions
examples
of
this
custom
have
been
already
given
and
an
explanation
of
them
offered
on
the
other
hand
when
the
revered
animal
is
habitually
killed
the
slaughter
of
any
one
of
the
species
involves
the
killing
of
the
god
and
is
atoned
for
on
the
spot
by
apologies
and
sacrifices
especially
when
the
animal
is
a
powerful
and
dangerous
one
and
in
addition
to
this
ordinary
and
everyday
atonement
there
is
a
special
annual
atonement
at
which
a
select
individual
of
the
species
is
slain
with
extraordinary
marks
of
respect
and
devotion
clearly
the
two
types
of
sacramental
egyptian
and
the
aino
types
as
we
may
call
them
for
liable
to
be
confounded
by
an
observer
and
before
we
can
say
to
which
type
any
particular
example
belongs
it
is
necessary
to
ascertain
whether
the
animal
sacramentally
slain
belongs
to
a
species
which
is
habitually
spared
or
to
one
which
is
habitually
killed
by
the
tribe
in
the
former
case
the
example
belongs
to
the
egyptian
type
of
sacrament
in
the
latter
to
the
aino
type
the
practice
of
pastoral
tribes
appears
to
furnish
examples
of
both
types
of
sacrament
pastoral
tribes
says
a
learned
ethnologist
being
sometimes
obliged
to
sell
their
herds
to
strangers
who
may
handle
the
bones
disrespectfully
seek
to
avert
the
danger
which
such
a
sacrilege
would
entail
by
consecrating
one
of
the
herd
as
an
object
of
worship
eating
it
sacramentally
in
the
family
circle
with
closed
doors
and
afterwards
treating
the
bones
with
all
the
ceremonious
respect
which
strictly
speaking
should
be
accorded
to
every
head
of
cattle
but
which
being
punctually
paid
to
the
representative
animal
is
deemed
to
be
paid
to
all
such
family
meals
are
found
among
various
peoples
especially
those
of
the
caucasus
when
amongst
the
abchases
the
shepherds
in
spring
eat
their
common
meal
with
their
loins
girt
and
their
staves
in
their
hands
this
may
be
looked
upon
both
as
a
sacrament
and
as
an
oath
of
mutual
help
and
support
for
the
strongest
of
all
oaths
is
that
which
is
accompanied
with
the
eating
of
a
sacred
substance
since
the
perjured
person
can
not
possibly
escape
the
avenging
god
whom
he
has
taken
into
his
body
and
this
kind
of
sacrament
is
of
the
aino
or
expiatory
type
since
it
is
meant
to
atone
to
the
species
for
the
possible
of
individuals
an
expiation
similar
in
principle
but
different
in
details
is
offered
by
the
kalmucks
to
the
sheep
whose
flesh
is
one
of
their
staple
foods
rich
kalmucks
are
in
the
habit
of
consecrating
a
white
ram
under
the
title
of
the
ram
of
heaven
or
the
ram
of
the
the
animal
is
never
shorn
and
never
sold
but
when
it
grows
old
and
its
owner
wishes
to
consecrate
a
new
one
the
old
ram
must
be
killed
and
eaten
at
a
feast
to
which
the
neighbours
are
invited
on
a
lucky
day
generally
in
autumn
when
the
sheep
are
fat
a
sorcerer
kills
the
old
ram
after
sprinkling
it
with
milk
its
flesh
is
eaten
the
skeleton
with
a
portion
of
the
fat
is
burned
on
a
turf
altar
and
the
skin
with
the
head
and
feet
is
hung
up
an
example
of
a
sacrament
of
the
egyptian
type
is
furnished
by
the
todas
a
pastoral
people
of
southern
india
who
subsist
largely
upon
the
milk
of
their
buffaloes
amongst
them
the
buffalo
is
to
a
certain
degree
held
sacred
and
is
treated
with
great
kindness
even
with
a
degree
of
adoration
by
the
they
never
eat
the
flesh
of
the
cow
buffalo
and
as
a
rule
abstain
from
the
flesh
of
the
male
but
to
the
latter
rule
there
is
a
single
exception
once
a
year
all
the
adult
males
of
the
village
join
in
the
ceremony
of
killing
and
eating
a
very
young
male
calf
under
a
month
old
they
take
the
animal
into
the
dark
recesses
of
the
village
wood
where
it
is
killed
with
a
club
made
from
the
sacred
tree
of
the
todas
the
or
a
sacred
fire
having
been
made
by
the
rubbing
of
sticks
the
flesh
of
the
calf
is
roasted
on
the
embers
of
certain
trees
and
is
eaten
by
the
men
alone
women
being
excluded
from
the
assembly
this
is
the
only
occasion
on
which
the
todas
eat
buffalo
flesh
the
madi
or
moru
tribe
of
central
africa
whose
chief
wealth
is
their
cattle
though
they
also
practise
agriculture
appear
to
kill
a
lamb
sacramentally
on
certain
solemn
occasions
the
custom
is
thus
described
by
felkin
a
remarkable
custom
is
observed
at
stated
a
year
i
am
led
to
believe
i
have
not
been
able
to
ascertain
what
exact
meaning
is
attached
to
it
it
appears
however
to
relieve
the
people
s
minds
for
beforehand
they
evince
much
sadness
and
seem
very
joyful
when
the
ceremony
is
duly
accomplished
the
following
is
what
takes
place
a
large
concourse
of
people
of
all
ages
assemble
and
sit
down
round
a
circle
of
stones
which
is
erected
by
the
side
of
a
road
really
a
narrow
path
a
very
choice
lamb
is
then
fetched
by
a
boy
who
leads
it
four
times
round
the
assembled
people
as
it
passes
they
pluck
off
little
bits
of
its
fleece
and
place
them
in
their
hair
or
on
to
some
other
part
of
their
body
the
lamb
is
then
led
up
to
the
stones
and
there
killed
by
a
man
belonging
to
a
kind
of
priestly
order
who
takes
some
of
the
blood
and
sprinkles
it
four
times
over
the
people
he
then
applies
it
individually
on
the
children
he
makes
a
small
ring
of
blood
over
the
lower
end
of
the
breast
bone
on
women
and
girls
he
makes
a
mark
above
the
breasts
and
the
men
he
touches
on
each
shoulder
he
then
proceeds
to
explain
the
ceremony
and
to
exhort
the
people
to
show
kindness
when
this
discourse
which
is
at
times
of
great
length
is
over
the
people
rise
each
places
a
leaf
on
or
by
the
circle
of
stones
and
then
they
depart
with
signs
of
great
joy
the
lamb
s
skull
is
hung
on
a
tree
near
the
stones
and
its
flesh
is
eaten
by
the
poor
this
ceremony
is
observed
on
a
small
scale
at
other
times
if
a
family
is
in
any
great
trouble
through
illness
or
bereavement
their
friends
and
neighbours
come
together
and
a
lamb
is
killed
this
is
thought
to
avert
further
evil
the
same
custom
prevails
at
the
grave
of
departed
friends
and
also
on
joyful
occasions
such
as
the
return
of
a
son
home
after
a
very
prolonged
the
sorrow
thus
manifested
by
the
people
at
the
annual
slaughter
of
the
lamb
clearly
indicates
that
the
lamb
slain
is
a
sacred
or
divine
animal
whose
death
is
mourned
by
his
worshippers
just
as
the
death
of
the
sacred
buzzard
was
mourned
by
the
californians
and
the
death
of
the
theban
ram
by
the
egyptians
the
smearing
each
of
the
worshippers
with
the
blood
of
the
lamb
is
a
form
of
communion
with
the
divinity
the
vehicle
of
the
divine
life
is
applied
externally
instead
of
being
taken
internally
as
when
the
blood
is
drunk
or
the
flesh
eaten
processions
with
sacred
animals
the
form
of
communion
in
which
the
sacred
animal
is
taken
from
house
to
house
that
all
may
enjoy
a
share
of
its
divine
influence
has
been
exemplified
by
the
gilyak
custom
of
promenading
the
bear
through
the
village
before
it
is
slain
a
similar
form
of
communion
with
the
sacred
snake
is
observed
by
a
snake
tribe
in
the
punjaub
once
a
year
in
the
month
of
september
the
snake
is
worshipped
by
all
castes
and
religions
for
nine
days
only
at
the
end
of
august
the
mirasans
especially
those
of
the
snake
tribe
make
a
snake
of
dough
which
they
paint
black
and
red
and
place
on
a
winnowing
basket
this
basket
they
carry
round
the
village
and
on
entering
any
house
they
say
be
with
you
all
every
ill
be
far
our
patron
s
gugga
s
word
thrive
then
they
present
the
basket
with
the
snake
saying
small
cake
of
flour
little
bit
of
butter
you
obey
the
snake
and
yours
shall
thrive
strictly
speaking
a
cake
and
butter
should
be
given
but
it
is
seldom
done
every
one
however
gives
something
generally
a
handful
of
dough
or
some
corn
in
houses
where
there
is
a
new
bride
or
whence
a
bride
has
gone
or
where
a
son
has
been
born
it
is
usual
to
give
a
rupee
and
a
quarter
or
some
cloth
sometimes
the
bearers
of
the
snake
also
sing
the
snake
a
piece
of
cloth
he
will
send
a
lively
bride
when
every
house
has
been
thus
visited
the
dough
snake
is
buried
and
a
small
grave
is
erected
over
it
thither
during
the
nine
days
of
september
the
women
come
to
worship
they
bring
a
basin
of
curds
a
small
portion
of
which
they
offer
at
the
snake
s
grave
kneeling
on
the
ground
and
touching
the
earth
with
their
foreheads
then
they
go
home
and
divide
the
rest
of
the
curds
among
the
children
here
the
dough
snake
is
clearly
a
substitute
for
a
real
snake
indeed
in
districts
where
snakes
abound
the
worship
is
offered
not
at
the
grave
of
the
dough
snake
but
in
the
jungles
where
snakes
are
known
to
be
besides
this
yearly
worship
performed
by
all
the
people
the
members
of
the
snake
tribe
worship
in
the
same
way
every
morning
after
a
new
moon
the
snake
tribe
is
not
uncommon
in
the
punjaub
members
of
it
will
not
kill
a
snake
and
they
say
that
its
bite
does
not
hurt
them
if
they
find
a
dead
snake
they
put
clothes
on
it
and
give
it
a
regular
funeral
ceremonies
closely
analogous
to
this
indian
worship
of
the
snake
have
survived
in
europe
into
recent
times
and
doubtless
date
from
a
very
primitive
paganism
the
example
is
the
hunting
of
the
by
many
european
ancient
greeks
and
romans
the
modern
italians
spaniards
french
germans
dutch
danes
swedes
english
and
wren
has
been
designated
the
king
the
little
king
the
king
of
birds
the
hedge
king
and
so
forth
and
has
been
reckoned
amongst
those
birds
which
it
is
extremely
unlucky
to
kill
in
england
it
is
supposed
that
if
any
one
kills
a
wren
or
harries
its
nest
he
will
infallibly
break
a
bone
or
meet
with
some
dreadful
misfortune
within
the
year
sometimes
it
is
thought
that
the
cows
will
give
bloody
milk
in
scotland
the
wren
is
called
the
lady
of
heaven
s
hen
and
boys
say
malisons
mair
than
ten
harry
the
ladye
of
heaven
s
hen
at
saint
donan
in
brittany
people
believe
that
if
children
touch
the
young
wrens
in
the
nest
they
will
suffer
from
the
fire
of
lawrence
that
is
from
pimples
on
the
face
legs
and
so
on
in
other
parts
of
france
it
is
thought
that
if
a
person
kills
a
wren
or
harries
its
nest
his
house
will
be
struck
by
lightning
or
that
the
fingers
with
which
he
did
the
deed
will
shrivel
up
and
drop
off
or
at
least
be
maimed
or
that
his
cattle
will
suffer
in
their
feet
notwithstanding
such
beliefs
the
custom
of
annually
killing
the
wren
has
prevailed
widely
both
in
this
country
and
in
france
in
the
isle
of
man
down
to
the
eighteenth
century
the
custom
was
observed
on
christmas
eve
or
rather
christmas
morning
on
the
of
december
towards
evening
all
the
servants
got
a
holiday
they
did
not
go
to
bed
all
night
but
rambled
about
till
the
bells
rang
in
all
the
churches
at
midnight
when
prayers
were
over
they
went
to
hunt
the
wren
and
having
found
one
of
these
birds
they
killed
it
and
fastened
it
to
the
top
of
a
long
pole
with
its
wings
extended
thus
they
carried
it
in
procession
to
every
house
chanting
the
following
rhyme
hunted
the
wren
for
robin
the
bobbin
hunted
the
wren
for
jack
of
the
can
hunted
the
wren
for
robin
the
bobbin
hunted
the
wren
for
every
when
they
had
gone
from
house
to
house
and
collected
all
the
money
they
could
they
laid
the
wren
on
a
bier
and
carried
it
in
procession
to
the
parish
churchyard
where
they
made
a
grave
and
buried
it
with
the
utmost
solemnity
singing
dirges
over
her
in
the
manks
language
which
they
call
her
knell
after
which
christmas
the
burial
over
the
company
outside
the
churchyard
formed
a
circle
and
danced
to
music
about
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
burial
of
the
wren
took
place
in
the
isle
of
man
on
stephen
s
day
the
of
december
boys
went
from
door
to
door
with
a
wren
suspended
by
the
legs
in
the
centre
of
two
hoops
which
crossed
each
other
at
right
angles
and
were
decorated
with
evergreens
and
ribbons
the
bearers
sang
certain
lines
in
which
reference
was
made
to
boiling
and
eating
the
bird
if
at
the
close
of
the
song
they
received
a
small
coin
they
gave
in
return
a
feather
of
the
wren
so
that
before
the
end
of
the
day
the
bird
often
hung
almost
featherless
the
wren
was
then
buried
no
longer
in
the
churchyard
but
on
the
or
in
some
waste
place
the
feathers
distributed
were
preserved
with
religious
care
it
being
believed
that
every
feather
was
an
effectual
preservative
from
shipwreck
for
a
year
and
a
fisherman
would
have
been
thought
very
foolhardy
who
had
not
one
of
them
even
to
the
present
time
in
the
twentieth
century
the
custom
is
generally
observed
at
least
in
name
on
stephen
s
day
throughout
the
isle
of
man
a
writer
of
the
eighteenth
century
says
that
in
ireland
the
wren
is
still
hunted
and
killed
by
the
peasants
on
christmas
day
and
on
the
following
stephen
s
day
he
is
carried
about
hung
by
the
leg
in
the
centre
of
two
hoops
crossing
each
other
at
right
angles
and
a
procession
made
in
every
village
of
men
women
and
children
singing
an
irish
catch
importing
him
to
be
the
king
of
all
down
to
the
present
time
the
hunting
of
the
wren
still
takes
place
in
parts
of
leinster
and
connaught
on
christmas
day
or
stephen
s
day
the
boys
hunt
and
kill
the
wren
fasten
it
in
the
middle
of
a
mass
of
holly
and
ivy
on
the
top
of
a
broomstick
and
on
stephen

day
go
about
with
it
from

a
money
or
food
bread
butter
eggs
etc
were
given
them
upon
which
they
feasted
in
the
evening
in
essex
a
similar
custom
used
to
be
observed
at
christmas
and
the
verses
sung
by
the
boys
were
almost
identical
with
those
sung
in
ireland
in
pembrokeshire
a
wren
called
the
king
used
to
be
carried
about
on
twelfth
day
in
a
box
with
glass
windows
surmounted
by
a
wheel
from
which
hung
various
coloured
ribbons
the
men
and
boys
who
carried
it
from
house
to
house
sang
songs
in
one
of
which
they
wished
joy
health
love
and
peace
to
the
inmates
of
the
house
in
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
similar
customs
were
still
observed
in
various
parts
of
the
south
of
france
thus
at
carcassone
every
year
on
the
first
sunday
of
december
the
young
people
of
the
street
saint
jean
used
to
go
out
of
the
town
armed
with
sticks
with
which
they
beat
the
bushes
looking
for
wrens
the
first
to
strike
down
one
of
these
birds
was
proclaimed
king
then
they
returned
to
the
town
in
procession
headed
by
the
king
who
carried
the
wren
on
a
pole
on
the
evening
of
the
last
day
of
the
year
the
king
and
all
who
had
hunted
the
wren
marched
through
the
streets
of
the
town
to
the
light
of
torches
with
drums
beating
and
fifes
playing
in
front
of
them
at
the
door
of
every
house
they
stopped
and
one
of
them
wrote
with
chalk
on
the
door
le
roi
with
the
number
of
the
year
which
was
about
to
begin
on
the
morning
of
twelfth
day
the
king
again
marched
in
procession
with
great
pomp
wearing
a
crown
and
a
blue
mantle
and
carrying
a
sceptre
in
front
of
him
was
borne
the
wren
fastened
to
the
top
of
a
pole
which
was
adorned
with
a
verdant
wreath
of
olive
of
oak
and
sometimes
of
mistletoe
grown
on
an
oak
after
hearing
high
mass
in
the
parish
church
of
vincent
surrounded
by
his
officers
and
guards
the
king
visited
the
bishop
the
mayor
the
magistrates
and
the
chief
inhabitants
collecting
money
to
defray
the
expenses
of
the
royal
banquet
which
took
place
in
the
evening
and
wound
up
with
a
dance
at
entraigues
men
and
boys
used
to
hunt
the
wren
on
christmas
eve
when
they
caught
one
alive
they
presented
it
to
the
priest
who
after
the
midnight
mass
set
the
bird
free
in
the
church
at
mirabeau
the
priest
blessed
the
bird
if
the
men
failed
to
catch
a
wren
and
the
women
succeeded
in
doing
so
the
women
had
the
right
to
mock
and
insult
the
men
and
to
blacken
their
faces
with
mud
and
soot
when
they
caught
them
at
la
ciotat
near
marseilles
a
large
body
of
men
armed
with
swords
and
pistols
used
to
hunt
the
wren
every
year
about
the
end
of
december
when
a
wren
was
caught
it
was
hung
on
the
middle
of
a
pole
which
two
men
carried
as
if
it
were
a
heavy
burden
thus
they
paraded
round
the
town
the
bird
was
weighed
in
a
great
pair
of
scales
and
then
the
company
sat
down
to
table
and
made
merry
the
parallelism
between
this
custom
of
hunting
the
wren
and
some
of
those
which
we
have
considered
especially
the
gilyak
procession
with
the
bear
and
the
indian
one
with
the
snake
seems
too
close
to
allow
us
to
doubt
that
they
all
belong
to
the
same
circle
of
ideas
the
worshipful
animal
is
killed
with
special
solemnity
once
a
year
and
before
or
immediately
after
death
he
is
promenaded
from
door
to
door
that
each
of
his
worshippers
may
receive
a
portion
of
the
divine
virtues
that
are
supposed
to
emanate
from
the
dead
or
dying
god
religious
processions
of
this
sort
must
have
had
a
great
place
in
the
ritual
of
european
peoples
in
prehistoric
times
if
we
may
judge
from
the
numerous
traces
of
them
which
have
survived
in
a
specimen
is
the
following
which
lasted
in
the
highlands
of
scotland
and
in
kilda
down
at
least
to
the
latter
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
it
was
described
to
samuel
johnson
in
the
island
of
coll
another
description
of
it
runs
as
follows
on
the
evening
before
new
year
s
day
it
is
usual
for
the
cowherd
and
the
young
people
to
meet
together
and
one
of
them
is
covered
with
a
cow

of

are
provided
with

the

louder
and

beat

then
come
to
the
door
of
each
and
one
of
them
repeats
some
verses
composed
for
the
purpose
when
admission
is
granted
one
of
them
pronounces
within
the
threshold
the
or
verses
by
which
he
pretends
to
draw
down
a
blessing

this
they
imagine
will
tend
much
to
secure
them
from
diseases
and
other
misfortunes
during
the
ensuing
year
the
whole
of
the
ceremony
is
called
from
the
great
noise
which
the
hide
makes
it
is
the
principal
remnant
of
superstition
among
the
inhabitants
of
a
more
recent

described
the
old
highland
custom

towards

made
off
followed
by

the

made
a
noise
like

a
drop
of
drink
was
given
till
this
ceremony
was
performed
the
was
also
made
of
the
or
tail
of
a
deer
sheep
or
goat
and
as
many
as
chose
had
one
with
another
writer
who
gives
a
similar
account
of
the
ceremony
and
of
the
verses
sung
by
the
performers
tells
us
that
the
intention
of
putting
the
burnt
to
the
noses
of
the
people
was
to
protect
them
against
witchcraft
and
every
infection
the
explanation
which
is
doubtless
correct
reminds
us
of
the
extraordinarily
persistent
hold
which
the
belief
in
sorcery
and
witchcraft
has
retained
on
the
minds
of
the
european
peasantry
formerly
perhaps
pieces
of
the
in
which
the
man
was
clad
were
singed
and
put
to
the
noses
of
the
people
just
as
in
the
isle
of
man
a
feather
of
the
wren
used
to
be
given
to
each
household
similarly
as
we
have
seen
the
human
victim
whom
the
khonds
slew
as
a
divinity
was
taken
from
house
to
house
and
every
one
strove
to
obtain
a
relic
of
his
sacred
person
such
customs
are
only
another
form
of
that
communion
with
the
deity
which
is
attained
most
completely
by
eating
the
body
and
drinking
the
blood
of
the
god
the
rites
of
plough
monday
in
the
hunting
of
the
wren
and
the
procession
with
the
man
clad
in
a
there
is
nothing
to
shew
that
the
customs
in
question
have
any
relation
to
agriculture
so
far
as
appears
they
may
date
from
a
time
before
the
invention
of
husbandry
when
animals
were
revered
as
divine
in
themselves
not
merely
as
divine
because
they
embodied
the
and
the
analogy
of
the
gilyak
procession
of
the
bear
and
the
indian
procession
of
the
snake
is
in
favour
of
assigning
the
corresponding
european
customs
to
this
very
early
date
on
the
other
hand
there
are
certain
european
processions
of
animals
or
of
men
disguised
as
animals
which
may
perhaps
be
purely
agricultural
in
their
origin
in
other
words
the
animals
which
figure
in
them
may
have
been
from
the
first
nothing
but
representatives
of
the
conceived
in
animal
shape
examples
of
such
dramatic
and
at
the
same
time
religious
rites
have
been
collected
by
mannhardt
who
says
of
them
in
general
not
only
on
the
harvest
field
and
on
the
but
also
quite
apart
from
them
people
loved
to
represent
the
dramatically
especially
in
solemn
processions
in
spring
and
about
the
winter
solstice
whereby
they
meant
to
depict
the
return
of
the
beneficent
powers
of
summer
to
the
desolate
realm
of
thus
for
example
in
country
districts
of
bohemia
it
is
or
used
to
be
customary
during
the
last
days
of
the
carnival
for
young
men
to
go
about
in
procession
from
house
to
house
collecting
gratuities
usually
a
man
or
boy
is
swathed
from
head
to
foot
in
and
wrapt
round
in
thus
attired
he
goes
by
the
name
of
the
shrovetide
or
carnival
bear
and
is
led
from
house
to
house
to
the
accompaniment
of
music
and
singing
in
every
house
he
dances
with
the
girls
the
maids
and
the
housewife
herself
and
drinks
to
the
health
of
the
good
man
the
good
wife
and
the
girls
for
this
performance
the
mummer
is
regaled
with
food
by
the
good
wife
while
the
good
man
puts
money
in
his
box
when
the
mummers
have
gone
the
round
of
the
village
they
betake
themselves
to
the
whither
also
all
the
peasants
repair
with
their
wives
for
at
shrovetide
but
especially
on
shrove
tuesday
every
one
must
dance
if
the
flax
the
vegetables
and
the
corn
are
to
thrive
and
the
more
and
the
higher
they
dance
the
greater
the
blessing
which
the
people
expect
to
crown
their
in
the
leitmeritz
district
the
shrovetide
bear
besides
being
wrapt
in
straw
sometimes
wears
a
bear
s
mask
to
emphasise
his
resemblance
to
the
animal
in
the
czech
villages
the
housewives
pluck
the
and
other
straw
from
the
shrovetide
bear
and
put
it
in
the
nests
of
their
geese
believing
that
the
geese
will
lay
more
eggs
and
hatch
their
broods
better
for
the
addition
of
this
straw
to
their
nests
for
a
similar
purpose
in
the
saaz
district
the
women
put
the
straw
of
the
shrovetide
bear
in
the
nests
of
their
hens
in
these
customs
the
dancing
for
the
express
purpose
of
making
the
crops
grow
high
and
the
use
of
the
straw
to
make
the
geese
and
hens
lay
more
eggs
sufficiently
prove
that
the
shrovetide
bear
is
conceived
to
represent
the
spirit
of
fertility
both
animal
and
vegetable
and
we
may
reasonably
conjecture
that
the
dances
of
the
mummer
with
the
women
and
girls
are
especially
intended
to
convey
to
them
the
fertilising
powers
of
the
spirit
whom
the
mummer
personates
in
some
parts
of
bohemia
the
man
in
these
shrovetide
processions
is
called
not
the
bear
but
the
and
he
wears
horns
on
his
head
to
give
point
to
the
name
these
different
names
and
disguises
indicate
that
in
some
places
the
is
conceived
as
a
bear
and
in
others
as
a
goat
many
examples
of
the
conception
of
the
as
a
goat
have
already
been
cited
the
conception
of
him
as
a
bear
seems
to
be
less
common
in
the
neighbourhood
of
gniewkowo
in
prussian
lithuania
the
two
ideas
are
combined
for
on
twelfth
day
a
man
wrapt
in
to
represent
a
bear
and
another
wrapt
in
to
represent
a
goat
go
together
about
the
village
they
imitate
the
actions
of
the
two
animals
and
perform
dances
for
which
they
receive
a
present
in
every
house
at
marburg
in
steiermark
the
figures
now
as
a
wolf
and
now
as
a
bear
the
man
who
gave
the
last
stroke
at
threshing
is
called
the
wolf
all
the
other
men
flee
from
the
barn
and
wait
till
the
wolf
comes
forth
whereupon
they
pounce
on
him
wrap
him
in
straw
to
resemble
a
wolf
and
so
lead
him
about
the
village
he
keeps
the
name
of
wolf
till
christmas
when
he
is
wrapt
in
a
goat
s
skin
and
led
from
house
to
house
as
a
at
the
end
of
a
rope
in
this
custom
the
dressing
of
the
mummer
in
a
goat
s
skin
seems
to
mark
him
out
as
the
representative
of
a
goat
so
that
here
the
mythical
fancy
of
the
people
apparently
hesitates
between
a
goat
a
bear
and
a
wolf
as
the
proper
embodiment
of
the
in
scandinavia
the
conception
of
the
spirit
as
a
goat
who
appears
at
christmas
appears
to
be
common
thus
for
example
in
bergslagshärad
sweden
it
used
to
be
customary
at
christmas
to
lead
about
a
man
completely
wrapt
in
and
wearing
a
goat
s
horns
on
his
head
he
personated
the
in
some
parts
of
sweden
a
regular
feature
of
the
little
christmas
drama
is
a
pretence
of
slaughtering
the
who
however
comes
to
life
again
the
actor
hidden
by
a
coverlet
made
of
skins
and
wearing
a
pair
of
formidable
horns
is
led
into
the
room
by
two
men
who
make
believe
to
slaughter
him
while
they
sing
verses
referring
to
the
mantles
of
various
colours
red
blue
white
and
yellow
which
they
laid
on
him
one
after
the
other
at
the
conclusion
of
the
song
the
after
feigning
death
jumps
up
and
skips
about
to
the
amusement
of
the
spectators
in
willstad
after
supper
on
christmas
evening
while
the
people
are
dancing
the
angel
dance
for
the
sake
of
ensuring
a
good
crop
of
flax
some
long
stalks
of
the
yule
straw
either
of
wheat
or
rye
are
made
up
into
the
likeness
of
a
goat
which
is
thrown
among
the
dancers
with
the
cry
catch
the
the
custom
in
dalarne
is
similar
except
that
there
the
goes
by
the
name
of
the
in
these
customs
the
identification
of
the
or
the
with
the
seems
unmistakable
as
if
to
clinch
the
argument
it
is
customary
in
denmark
and
sweden
to
bake
cakes
of
fine
meal
at
christmas
in
the
form
of
goats
rams
or
boars
these
are
called
or
they
are
often
made
out
of
the
last
sheaf
of
corn
at
harvest
and
kept
till
when
they
are
partly
mixed
with
the
and
partly
eaten
by
the
people
and
the
in
the
hope
thereby
of
securing
a
good
harvest
it
would
seem
scarcely
possible
to
represent
the
identification
of
the
with
an
animal
whether
goat
ram
or
boar
more
graphically
for
the
last
corn
cut
at
harvest
is
regularly
supposed
to
house
the
who
is
accordingly
caught
kept
through
the
winter
in
the
shape
of
an
animal
and
then
mixed
with
the
seed
in
spring
to
quicken
the
grain
before
it
is
committed
to
the
ground
examples
of
the
conceived
as
a
wether
and
a
boar
have
met
us
in
a
preceding
part
of
this
work
the
pretence
of
killing
the
and
bringing
him
to
life
again
was
probably
in
origin
a
magical
rite
to
ensure
the
rebirth
of
the
in
spring
in
england
a
custom
like
some
of
the
preceding
still
prevails
at
whittlesey
in
cambridgeshire
on
the
tuesday
after
plough
monday
as
i
learn
from
an
obliging
communication
of
professor
moore
smith
of
sheffield
university
he
writes
when
i
was
at
whittlesey
yesterday
i
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
a
if
not
two
in
the
street
i
had
not
been
at
whittlesey
on
the
day
for
nearly
forty
years
and
feared
the
custom
had
died
out
in
my
boyhood
the
was
a
man
completely
swathed
in
straw
led
by
a
string
by
another
and
made
to
dance
in
front
of
people
s
houses
in
return
for
which
money
was
expected
this
always
took
place
on
the
tuesday
following
yesterday
the
was
a
boy
and
i
saw
no
dancing
otherwise
there
was
no
a
comparison
of
this
english
custom
with
the
similar
continental
customs
which
have
been
described
above
raises
a
presumption
that
the
who
is
thus
led
about
from
house
to
house
represents
the
bestowing
his
blessing
on
every
homestead
in
the
village
this
interpretation
is
strongly
confirmed
by
the
date
at
which
the
ceremony
takes
place
for
the
date
is
the
day
after
plough
monday
and
it
can
hardly
be
doubted
that
the
old
popular
celebration
of
plough
monday
has
a
direct
reference
to
agriculture
plough
monday
is
the
first
monday
of
january
after
twelfth
day
on
that
day
it
used
to
be
the
custom
in
various
parts
of
england
for
a
band
of
sturdy
swains
to
drag
a
gaily
decorated
plough
from
house
to
house
and
village
to
village
collecting
contributions
which
were
afterwards
spent
in
rustic
revelry
at
a
tavern
the
men
who
drew
the
plough
were
called
plough
bullocks
they
wore
their
shirts
over
their
coats
and
bunches
of
ribbons
flaunted
from
their
hats
and
persons
among
them
there
was
always
one
who
personated
a
much
bedizened
old
woman
called
bessy
under
his
gown
he
formerly
had
a
bullock
s
tail
fastened
to
him
behind
but
this
appendage
was
afterwards
discarded
he
skipped
danced
and
cut
capers
and
carried
a
soliciting
contributions
from
the
onlookers
some
of
the
band
in
addition
to
their
ribbons
also
wore
small
bunches
of
corn
in
their
hats
from
which
the
wheat
was
soon
shaken
out
by
the
ungainly
jumping
which
they
called
dancing
occasionally
if
the
winter
was
severe
the
procession
was
joined
by
threshers
carrying
their
flails
reapers
bearing
their
sickles
and
carters
with
their
long
whips
which
they
were
ever
cracking
to
add
to
the
noise
while
even
the
smith
and
the
miller
were
among
the
number
for
the
one
sharpened
the
and
the
other
ground
the
corn
and
bessy
rattled
his
box
and
danced
so
high
that
he
shewed
his
worsted
stockings
and
corduroy
breeches
and
very
often
if
there
was
a
thaw
tucked
up
his
gown
skirts
under
his
waistcoat
and
shook
the
bonnet
off
his
head
and
disarranged
the
long
ringlets
that
ought
to
have
concealed
his
sometimes
among
the
mummers
there
was
a
fool
who
wore
the
skin
of
a
calf
with
the
tail
hanging
down
behind
and
wielded
a
stick
with
an
inflated
bladder
tied
to
it
which
he
applied
with
rude
vigour
to
the
heads
and
shoulders
of
the
human
team
another
mummer
generally
wore
a
fox
s
skin
in
the
form
of
a
hood
with
the
tail
dangling
on
his
back
if
any
churl
refused
to
contribute
to
the
the
put
their
shoulders
to
the
plough
and
ploughed
up
the
ground
in
front
of
his
door
the
clue
to
the
meaning
of
these
curious
rites
is
probably
furnished
by
the
dances
or
rather
jumps
of
the
men
who
wore
bunches
of
corn
in
their
hats
when
we
remember
how
often
on
the
continent
about
the
same
time
of
year
the
peasants
dance
and
jump
for
the
express
purpose
of
making
the
crops
grow
tall
we
may
conjecture
with
some
probability
that
the
intention
of
the
dancers
on
plough
monday
was
similar
the
original
notion
we
may
suppose
was
that
the
corn
would
grow
that
year
just
as
high
as
the
dancers
leaped
if
that
was
so
we
need
not
wonder
at
the
agility
displayed
on
these
occasions
by
the
yokels
in
general
and
by
bessy
in
particular
what
stronger
incentive
could
they
have
to
exert
themselves
than
the
belief
that
the
higher
they
leaped
into
the
air
the
higher
would
sprout
the
in
short
the
whole
ceremony
was
probably
a
magical
rite
intended
to
procure
a
good
crop
the
principle
on
which
it
rested
was
the
familiar
one
of
homoeopathic
or
imitative
magic
by
mimicking
the
act
of
ploughing
and
the
growth
of
the
corn
the
mummers
hoped
to
ensure
the
success
of
the
real
ploughing
which
was
soon
to
take
place
if
such
was
the
real
meaning
of
the
ritual
of
plough
monday
we
may
the
more
confidently
assume
that
the
who
makes
his
appearance
at
whittlesey
in
cambridgeshire
on
the
day
after
plough
monday
represents
indeed
the
what
could
be
more
appropriate
than
for
that
beneficent
being
to
manifest
himself
from
house
to
house
the
very
day
after
a
magical
ceremony
had
been
performed
to
quicken
the
growth
of
the
corn
the
foregoing
interpretation
of
the
rites
observed
in
england
on
plough
monday
tallies
well
with
the
explanation
which
i
have
given
of
the
very
similar
rites
annually
performed
at
the
end
of
the
carnival
in
thrace
the
mock
ploughing
is
probably
practised
for
the
same
purpose
in
both
cases
and
what
that
purpose
is
may
be
safely
inferred
from
the
act
of
sowing
and
the
offering
of
prayers
for
abundant
crops
which
accompany
and
explain
the
thracian
ceremony
it
deserves
to
be
noted
that
ceremonies
of
the
same
sort
and
closely
resembling
those
of
plough
monday
are
not
confined
to
the
greek
villages
of
thrace
but
are
observed
also
by
the
bulgarians
of
that
province
at
the
same
time
namely
on
the
monday
of
the
last
week
in
carnival
thus
at
in
the
district
of
adrianople
a
procession
of
mummers
goes
through
the
streets
on
that
day
the
principal
personages
in
it
bear
the
names
of
the
and
the
is
a
man
clad
in
a
goatskin
his
face
is
blackened
with
soot
and
he
wears
on
his
head
a
high
shaggy
hat
made
of
an
entire
skin
bells
jingle
at
his
girdle
and
in
his
hand
he
carries
a
club
the
who
sometimes
goes
by
the
name
of
that
is
old
woman
is
a
man
disguised
in
petticoats
with
his
face
blackened
other
figures
in
the
procession
are
young
men
dressed
as
girls
and
girls
dressed
as
men
and
wearing
masks
bears
are
represented
by
dogs
wrapt
in
bearskins
a
king
a
judge
and
other
officials
are
personated
by
other
mummers
they
hold
a
mock
court
and
those
whom
they
condemn
receive
a
bastinado
some
of
the
maskers
carry
clubs
it
is
their
duty
to
beat
all
who
fall
into
their
hands
and
to
levy
contributions
from
them
the
play
and
gestures
of
the
and
are
wanton
and
lascivious
the
songs
and
cries
addressed
to
the
are
also
very
cynical
towards
evening
two
of
the
company
are
yoked
to
a
plough
and
the
ploughs
a
few
furrows
which
he
thereupon
sows
with
corn
after
sunset
he
puts
off
his
disguise
is
paid
for
his
trouble
and
carouses
with
his
fellows
the
people
believe
that
the
man
who
plays
the
part
of
commits
a
deadly
sin
and
the
priests
make
vain
efforts
to
abolish
the
custom
at
the
village
of
kuria
in
the
district
of
losengrad
the
custom
is
in
general
the
same
but
there
are
some
significant
variations
the
money
collected
by
the
mummers
is
used
to
buy
wine
which
is
distributed
among
all
the
villagers
at
a
banquet
in
the
evening
on
this
occasion
a
cake
in
which
an
old
coin
has
been
baked
is
produced
by
the
broken
into
bits
and
so
divided
among
all
present
if
the
bit
with
the
coin
in
it
falls
to
a
farmer
then
the
crops
will
be
good
that
year
but
if
it
falls
to
a
herdsman
then
the
cattle
will
thrive
finally
the
ploughs
a
small
patch
of
ground
bending
his
body
to
right
and
left
in
order
to
indicate
symbolically
the
ears
of
corn
bending
under
the
weight
of
the
the
others
lay
hold
of
the
man
with
whom
the
coin
was
found
bind
him
by
the
feet
and
drag
him
over
the
land
that
has
just
been
ploughed
in
these
observances
the
intention
of
promoting
the
fertility
of
the
ground
is
unmistakable
the
ploughman
s
imitation
of
the
cornstalks
bending
under
their
own
weight
is
a
simple
case
of
homoeopathic
or
imitative
magic
while
the
omens
drawn
from
the
occupation
of
the
person
who
obtains
the
piece
of
cake
with
the
coin
in
it
indicate
that
the
ceremony
is
designed
to
quicken
the
herds
as
well
as
the
crops
we
can
hardly
doubt
that
the
same
serious
motive
underlies
the
seemingly
wanton
gestures
of
the
principal
actors
and
explains
the
loose
character
of
the
songs
and
words
which
accompany
the
ceremony
nor
is
it
hard
to
divine
the
reason
for
dragging
over
the
fresh
furrows
the
man
who
is
lucky
enough
to
get
the
coin
in
the
cake
he
is
probably
looked
on
as
an
embodiment
of
the
and
in
that
character
is
compelled
to
fertilise
the
ground
by
bodily
contact
with
the
earth
similar
customs
are
observed
at
the
carnival
not
only
by
bulgarian
peasants
in
thrace
but
also
here
and
there
in
bulgaria
itself
in
that
country
the
leading
personage
of
the
masquerade
is
the
that
is
the
old
woman
or
mother
the
part
is
played
by
a
man
in
woman
s
clothes
she
or
rather
he
wears
no
mask
but
in
many
villages
she
carries
a
spindle
with
which
she
spins
the
and
the
also
figure
in
the
performance
but
they
are
subordinate
to
the
old
woman
or
mother
their
costume
varies
in
different
villages
usually
they
are
clad
in
skins
with
a
girdle
of
bark
and
five
or
six
bells
fastened
to
it
on
their
back
they
wear
a
hump
made
up
of
rags
but
the
principal
feature
in
their
attire
consists
of
their
masks
which
represent
the
heads
of
animals
and
men
in
fantastic
combinations
such
as
the
horned
head
of
a
man
or
a
bird
the
head
of
a
ram
a
bull
and
so
on
much
labour
is
spent
on
the
manufacture
of
these
masks
early
in
the
morning
of
cheese
monday
the
monday
of
the
last
week
in
carnival
the
mummers
go
about
the
village
levying
contributions
towards
noon
they
form
a
procession
and
go
from
house
to
house
in
every
house
they
dance
a
round
dance
while
the
old
woman
spins
it
is
believed
that
if
any
contrives
to
carry
off
the
old
woman
and
secrete
her
a
blessing
and
prosperity
will
enter
into
his
dwelling
but
the
maskers
defend
the
old
woman
stoutly
against
all
such
attempts
of
individuals
to
appropriate
her
beneficent
presence
after
the
dance
the
mummers
receive
gifts
of
money
eggs
meal
and
so
on
towards
evening
a
round
dance
is
danced
in
the
village
square
and
there
the
old
woman
yokes
the
and
to
a
plough
ploughs
with
it
a
small
piece
of
ground
and
sows
the
ground
with
corn
next
day
the
performers
reassemble
sell
the
presents
they
had
collected
and
with
the
produce
hold
a
feast
in
the
house
of
the
old
woman
it
is
supposed
that
if
strange
maskers
make
their
way
into
a
village
fertility
will
be
drawn
away
to
the
village
from
which
they
have
come
hence
the
villagers
resist
an
inroad
of
strange
maskers
at
any
price
in
general
the
people
believe
that
the
masquerade
is
performed
for
the
purpose
of
increasing
the
luck
and
fertility
of
the
village
in
these
bulgarian
rites
accordingly
we
are
not
left
to
form
conjectures
as
to
the
intention
with
which
they
are
practised
that
intention
is
plainly
avowed
and
it
is
no
other
than
the
one
which
we
have
inferred
for
the
similar
rites
observed
in
thrace
at
the
same
season
and
in
england
on
plough
monday
in
all
these
cases
it
is
reasonable
to
suppose
that
the
real
aim
of
the
ceremonial
ploughing
and
sowing
of
the
ground
is
thereby
on
the
principles
of
homoeopathic
or
imitative
magic
to
ensure
the
growth
of
the
corn
on
all
the
fields
of
the
community
perhaps
we
may
go
a
step
further
and
suggest
that
in
the
bulgarian
old
woman
or
mother
who
guides
the
plough
and
sows
the
seed
and
whose
presence
is
believed
to
bring
a
blessing
to
any
household
that
can
contrive
to
appropriate
her
we
have
the
rustic
prototype
of
demeter
the
who
in
the
likeness
of
an
old
woman
brought
a
blessing
to
the
house
of
celeus
king
of
eleusis
and
restored
their
lost
fertility
to
the
fallow
eleusinian
fields
and
in
the
pair
of
mummers
man
and
woman
who
draw
the
plough
may
we
not
discern
the
rude
originals
of
pluto
and
persephone
if
that
is
so
the
gods
of
greece
are
not
wholly
dead
they
still
hide
their
diminished
heads
in
the
cottages
of
the
peasantry
to
come
forth
on
sunshine
holidays
and
parade
with
a
simple
but
expressive
pageantry
among
a
gazing
crowd
of
rustics
at
the
very
moment
of
the
year
when
their
help
is
most
wanted
by
the
husbandman
be
that
as
it
may
these
rites
still
practised
by
the
peasantry
at
opposite
ends
of
europe
no
doubt
date
from
an
extremely
early
age
in
the
history
of
agriculture
they
are
probably
far
older
than
christianity
older
even
than
those
highly
developed
forms
of
greek
religion
with
which
ancient
writers
and
artists
have
made
us
familiar
but
which
have
been
for
so
many
centuries
a
thing
of
the
past
thus
it
happens
that
while
the
fine
flower
of
the
religious
consciousness
in
myth
ritual
and
art
is
fleeting
and
evanescent
its
simpler
forms
are
comparatively
stable
and
permanent
being
rooted
deep
in
those
principles
of
common
minds
which
bid
fair
to
outlive
all
the
splendid
but
transient
creations
of
genius
it
may
be
that
the
elaborate
theologies
the
solemn
rites
the
stately
temples
which
now
attract
the
reverence
or
the
wonder
of
mankind
are
destined
themselves
to
pass
away
like
all
olympus
faded
hierarchy
and
that
simple
folk
will
still
cherish
the
simple
faiths
of
their
nameless
and
dateless
forefathers
will
still
believe
in
witches
and
fairies
in
ghosts
and
hobgoblins
will
still
mumble
the
old
spells
and
make
the
old
magic
passes
when
the
muezzin
shall
have
ceased
to
call
the
faithful
to
prayer
from
the
minarets
of
sophia
and
when
the
worshippers
shall
gather
no
more
in
the
aisles
of

of

note
the
ceremony
of
the
horse
at
among
the
garos
among
the
garos
an
agricultural
tribe
of
assam
the
close
of
the
is
celebrated
by
a
festival
in
which
the
effigy
of
a
horse
figures
prominently
the
intention
of
the
ceremony
is
not
stated
but
possibly
it
may
be
to
ensure
a
good
rice
crop
in
the
following
year
if
so
the
artificial
horse
of
the
garos
would
be
analogous
to
the
october
horse
of
the
romans
as
that
animal
has
been
explained
by
mannhardt
for
the
sake
of
comparison
it
may
be
well
to
subjoin
major
playfair
s
account
of
the
garo
ceremony
when
the
rice
harvest
has
been
fully
gathered
in
the
great
sacrifice
and
festival
of
the
year
the
or
takes
place
this
is
the
most
festive
observance
of
the
year
and
combines
religious
sacrifice
with
much
conviviality
it
is
celebrated
by
all
sections
of
the
tribe
except
the
duals
and
some
plains
garos
the
cost
of
the
entertainment
falls
principally
on
the
headman
of
the
village
who
provides
a
pig
to
be
eaten
by
his
guests
and
plenty
of
liquor
among
the
akawés
and
chisaks
of
the
north
and
hills
a
curious
feature
of
the
ceremony
is
the
manufacture
of
or
horses
out
of
pieces
of
for
the
body
and
of
bamboo
for
the
head
and
legs
the
image
of
the
horse
is
laid
on
the
floor
of
the
house
and
the
assembled
guests
dance
and
sing
around
it
the
whole
night
long
with
the
usual
intervals
for
refreshments
early
the
next
morning
the
horse
is
taken
to
the
nearest
river
and
launched
on
the
water
to
find
its
way
down
stream
on
the
current
for
those
who
possess
the
necessary
paraphernalia
the
takes
the
shape
of
a
horse
s
head
of
large
size
made
of
straw
and
covered
with
cloth
i
once
saw
one
in
the
village
of
rongrong
which
when
in
use
was
ornamented
with
discs
of
brass
on
both
sides
of
the
face
its
eyes
and
ears
were
made
of
the
same
metal
and
between
the
ears
were
fixed
a
pair
of
wild
goat
s
horns
to
the
head
were
attached
a
number
of
bronze
bells
similar
to
those
hawked
about
by
bhutia
pedlars
the
owner
a
was
unable
to
tell
me
whence
they
came
but
said
that
they
were
inherited
from
his
wife
s
mother
and
were
many
generations
old
the
manner
in
which
this
form
of
is
used
is
the
following
the
head
is
mounted
on
a
stick
which
a
man
holds
before
him
in
such
a
way
that
the
head
comes
up
to
the
level
of
his
chest
two
straps
pass
over
his
shoulders
to
relieve
his
hands
of
the
weight
the
body
of
the
horse
is
then
built
round
his
own
body
with
cane
and
cloth
for
a
tail
yak
s
tails
are
fastened
in
with
his
own
hair
which
for
the
occasion
is
allowed
to
hang
down
instead
of
being
tied
up
the
performer
thus
apparelled
commences
to
dance
a
shuffling
step
to
the
usual
music
in
front
of
him
dances
the
priest
who
goes
through
the
pantomime
of
beckoning
the
animal
to
come
to
him
the
remaining
guests
of
the
headman
form
a
behind
the
horse
and
dance
after
it
when
the
first
man
gets
tired
another
takes
his
place
and
the
dancing
goes
on
right
through
the
night
a
pleasant
part
of
the
performance
is
the
pelting
of
the
with
eggs
a
piece
of
was
still
sticking
to
the
horn
of
the
which
was
shown
to
me
strictly
speaking
this
festival
should
last
for
three
days
and
two
nights
when
it
is
over
the
is
taken
to
a
stream
and
the
body
thrown
into
the
water
the
head
being
preserved
for
another
year
the
people
who
come
to
see
it
off
bring
rice
with
them
and
a
meal
by
the
water
s
edge
closes
the
proceedings
at
the
it
is
the
custom
to
mix
flour
with
water
and
for
the
assembled
people
to
dip
their
hands
into
the
mixture
and
make
white
on
the
posts
and
walls
of
the
house
and
on
the
backs
of
the
can
it
be
that
the
horse
whose
effigy
is
thus
made
at
and
thrown
into
the
water
while
the
head
is
kept
for
another
year
represents
the
spirit
of
the
rice
if
that
were
so
the
pelting
of
the
head
with
eggs
would
be
a
charm
to
ensure
fertility
and
the
throwing
of
it
into
water
would
be
a
and
on
the
same
theory
the
horse
s
head
would
be
comparable
to
the
demeter
of
phigalia
as
well
as
to
the
head
of
the
october
horse
at
rome
which
was
nailed
to
a
wall
probably
to
be
kept
there
till
next
october
if
we
knew
more
about
the
rites
of
the
demeter
at
phigalia
we
might
find
that
amongst
them
was
a
dance
of
a
man
or
woman
who
wore
the
mask
of
a
horse
s
head
and
personated
the
goddess
herself
just
as
if
i
am
right
the
man
who
dances
disguised
as
a
horse
at
the
harvest
festival
of
the
garos
represents
the
spirit
of
the
rice
dancing
among
the
garnered
sheaves
the
conjecture
is
to
some
extent
supported
by
the
remains
of
the
magnificent
marble
drapery
which
once
adorned
the
colossal
statue
of
demeter
or
persephone
in
the
sanctuary
of
the
two
goddesses
at
lycosura
in
arcadia
for
on
that
drapery
are
carved
rows
of
figures
dancing
and
playing
musical
instruments
the
bodies
of
the
figures
are
those
of
women
but
their
heads
paws
and
feet
are
those
of
animals
among
the
heads
set
on
the
figures
are
those
of
a
horse
a
pig
a
cat
or
a
hare
and
apparently
an
ass
it
is
reasonable
to
suppose
that
these
dancing
figures
represent
a
ritual
dance
which
was
actually
performed
in
the
rites
of
demeter
and
persephone
by
masked
men
or
women
who
personated
the
goddesses
in
their
character
of
beasts

after
describing

ceremony
as
he
witnessed

at

the
writer
adds
probably
the
ox
was
at
first
a
living
animal
which
they
sacrificed
and
distributed
the
flesh
to
the
bystanders
at
the
present
day
the
official
who
acts
as
pontiff
has
a
number
of
small
pasteboard
oxen
made
which
he
sends
to
the
notables
in
order
that
they
may
participate
intimately
in
the
sacrifice
which
is
more
than
symbolical
the
reason
for
carrying
the
ox
a
long
distance
is
that
as
much
as
possible
of
the
territory
may
be
sanctified
by
the
passage
of
the
sacred
animal
and
that
as
many

sacrifice

eyes

wishes

divinity
the

is
intended

however
the
motive
which
underlies
the

appears
to
be
a
fear
of
injuring

sympathetic

which
the

thomson
does
not
mention
honey
and
speaks
of
a
purgative
only
the
periods
during
which
meat
and
milk
are
alternately
consumed
vary
according
to
reichard
from
twelve
to
fifteen
days
we
may
conjecture
therefore
that
two
of
them
making
up
a
complete
cycle
correspond
to
a
lunar
month
with
reference
to
which
the
diet
is
perhaps
determined
beech
suk
their
language
and
oxford
in
both
cases
the
motive
as
with
the
masai
is
probably
a
fear
of
injuring
the
cattle
and
especially
of
causing
the
cows
to
loose
their
milk
this
is
confirmed
by
other
taboos
of
the
same
sort
observed
by
the
suk
thus
they
think
that
to
eat
the
flesh
of
a
certain
forest
pig
would
cause
the
cattle
of
the
eater
to
run
dry
and
that
if
a
rich
man
ate
fish
his
cows
would
give
no
milk

that
the

has
various
shades

used

after
another
word
and
according
to
the
object
to
which
it
is

the

is

objects
it
expresses
the
quality

usefulness

of

it
indicates
that
which
is
most
to

it
signifies
what
is

applied
as
a
prefix
to
animals
fish

fowl
it
represents
the
greatest

fiercest
or
the
most
useful
for
food

clothing
when
applied

it
is

expressive
of

unquestioning

the
savage
faith
in
human
immortality
is
commonly
supposed
to
be
deduced
from
a
primitive
theory
of
dreams
but
can
a
theory
of
dreams
account
for
the
savage
belief
in
the
immortality
of
animals
apparently
the
savage
conceives
life
as
an
indestructible
form
of
energy
analogy
of
the
conception
to
the
modern
scientific
conception
of
the
conservation
of

for
this
suggestion
i
am
indebted
to
a
hint
thrown
out
in
conversation
by
my
friend
professor
stout
see
dying
the
principle
of
the
conservation
of
energy
is
clearly
stated
and
illustrated
by
balfour
stewart
in
his
book
conservation
of
fourth
edition
london
the
writer
does
not
countenance
the
view
that
life
is
a
form
of
energy
distinct
from
and
independent
of
physical
and
chemical
forces
he
regards
a
living
being
simply
as
a
very
delicately
constructed
machine
in
which
the
natural
forces
are
in
a
state
of
unstable
equilibrium
to
avoid
misapprehension
it
may
be
well
to
add
that
i
do
not
pretend
to
argue
either
for
or
against
the
theory
of
life
which
appears
to
be
implicitly
adopted
by
the
savage
my
aim
is
simply
to
explain
not
to
justify
or
condemn
the
mental
attitude
of
primitive
man
towards
these
profound
problems

similar
