wuthering
heights
chapter
i
i
have
just
returned
from
a
visit
to
my
landlord
the
solitary
neighbour
that
i
shall
be
troubled
with
this
is
certainly
a
beautiful
country
in
all
england
i
do
not
believe
that
i
could
have
fixed
on
a
situation
so
completely
removed
from
the
stir
of
society
a
perfect
misanthropist
heaven
and
heathcliff
and
i
are
such
a
suitable
pair
to
divide
the
desolation
between
us
a
capital
fellow
he
little
imagined
how
my
heart
warmed
towards
him
when
i
beheld
his
black
eyes
withdraw
so
suspiciously
under
their
brows
as
i
rode
up
and
when
his
fingers
sheltered
themselves
with
a
jealous
resolution
still
further
in
his
waistcoat
as
i
announced
my
name
heathcliff
i
said
a
nod
was
the
answer
lockwood
your
new
tenant
sir
i
do
myself
the
honour
of
calling
as
soon
as
possible
after
my
arrival
to
express
the
hope
that
i
have
not
inconvenienced
you
by
my
perseverance
in
soliciting
the
occupation
of
thrushcross
grange
i
heard
yesterday
you
had
had
some
thoughts
grange
is
my
own
sir
he
interrupted
wincing
should
not
allow
any
one
to
inconvenience
me
if
i
could
hinder
it
walk
in
the
in
was
uttered
with
closed
teeth
and
expressed
the
sentiment
to
the
deuce
even
the
gate
over
which
he
leant
manifested
no
sympathising
movement
to
the
words
and
i
think
that
circumstance
determined
me
to
accept
the
invitation
i
felt
interested
in
a
man
who
seemed
more
exaggeratedly
reserved
than
myself
when
he
saw
my
horse
breast
fairly
pushing
the
barrier
he
did
put
out
his
hand
to
unchain
it
and
then
sullenly
preceded
me
up
the
causeway
calling
as
we
entered
the
court
take
lockwood
horse
and
bring
up
some
wine
we
have
the
whole
establishment
of
domestics
i
suppose
was
the
reflection
suggested
by
this
compound
order
wonder
the
grass
grows
up
between
the
flags
and
cattle
are
the
only
joseph
was
an
elderly
nay
an
old
man
very
old
perhaps
though
hale
and
sinewy
lord
help
us
he
soliloquised
in
an
undertone
of
peevish
displeasure
while
relieving
me
of
my
horse
looking
meantime
in
my
face
so
sourly
that
i
charitably
conjectured
he
must
have
need
of
divine
aid
to
digest
his
dinner
and
his
pious
ejaculation
had
no
reference
to
my
unexpected
advent
wuthering
heights
is
the
name
of
heathcliff
dwelling
being
a
significant
provincial
adjective
descriptive
of
the
atmospheric
tumult
to
which
its
station
is
exposed
in
stormy
weather
pure
bracing
ventilation
they
must
have
up
there
at
all
times
indeed
one
may
guess
the
power
of
the
north
wind
blowing
over
the
edge
by
the
excessive
slant
of
a
few
stunted
firs
at
the
end
of
the
house
and
by
a
range
of
gaunt
thorns
all
stretching
their
limbs
one
way
as
if
craving
alms
of
the
sun
happily
the
architect
had
foresight
to
build
it
strong
the
narrow
windows
are
deeply
set
in
the
wall
and
the
corners
defended
with
large
jutting
stones
before
passing
the
threshold
i
paused
to
admire
a
quantity
of
grotesque
carving
lavished
over
the
front
and
especially
about
the
principal
door
above
which
among
a
wilderness
of
crumbling
griffins
and
shameless
little
boys
i
detected
the
date
and
the
name
earnshaw
i
would
have
made
a
few
comments
and
requested
a
short
history
of
the
place
from
the
surly
owner
but
his
attitude
at
the
door
appeared
to
demand
my
speedy
entrance
or
complete
departure
and
i
had
no
desire
to
aggravate
his
impatience
previous
to
inspecting
the
penetralium
one
stop
brought
us
into
the
family
without
any
introductory
lobby
or
passage
they
call
it
here
it
includes
kitchen
and
parlour
generally
but
i
believe
at
wuthering
heights
the
kitchen
is
forced
to
retreat
altogether
into
another
quarter
at
least
i
distinguished
a
chatter
of
tongues
and
a
clatter
of
culinary
utensils
deep
within
and
i
observed
no
signs
of
roasting
boiling
or
baking
about
the
huge
fireplace
nor
any
glitter
of
copper
saucepans
and
tin
cullenders
on
the
walls
one
end
indeed
reflected
splendidly
both
light
and
heat
from
ranks
of
immense
pewter
dishes
interspersed
with
silver
jugs
and
tankards
towering
row
after
row
on
a
vast
oak
dresser
to
the
very
roof
the
latter
had
never
been
its
entire
anatomy
lay
bare
to
an
inquiring
eye
except
where
a
frame
of
wood
laden
with
oatcakes
and
clusters
of
legs
of
beef
mutton
and
ham
concealed
it
above
the
chimney
were
sundry
villainous
old
guns
and
a
couple
of
and
by
way
of
ornament
three
canisters
disposed
along
its
ledge
the
floor
was
of
smooth
white
stone
the
chairs
primitive
structures
painted
green
one
or
two
heavy
black
ones
lurking
in
the
shade
in
an
arch
under
the
dresser
reposed
a
huge
bitch
pointer
surrounded
by
a
swarm
of
squealing
puppies
and
other
dogs
haunted
other
recesses
the
apartment
and
furniture
would
have
been
nothing
extraordinary
as
belonging
to
a
homely
northern
farmer
with
a
stubborn
countenance
and
stalwart
limbs
set
out
to
advantage
in
and
gaiters
such
an
individual
seated
in
his
his
mug
of
ale
frothing
on
the
round
table
before
him
is
to
be
seen
in
any
circuit
of
five
or
six
miles
among
these
hills
if
you
go
at
the
right
time
after
dinner
but
heathcliff
forms
a
singular
contrast
to
his
abode
and
style
of
living
he
is
a
gipsy
in
aspect
in
dress
and
manners
a
gentleman
that
is
as
much
a
gentleman
as
many
a
country
squire
rather
slovenly
perhaps
yet
not
looking
amiss
with
his
negligence
because
he
has
an
erect
and
handsome
figure
and
rather
morose
possibly
some
people
might
suspect
him
of
a
degree
of
pride
i
have
a
sympathetic
chord
within
that
tells
me
it
is
nothing
of
the
sort
i
know
by
instinct
his
reserve
springs
from
an
aversion
to
showy
displays
of
feeling
to
manifestations
of
mutual
kindliness
he
love
and
hate
equally
under
cover
and
esteem
it
a
species
of
impertinence
to
be
loved
or
hated
again
no
i
running
on
too
fast
i
bestow
my
own
attributes
on
him
heathcliff
may
have
entirely
dissimilar
reasons
for
keeping
his
hand
out
of
the
way
when
he
meets
a
acquaintance
to
those
which
actuate
me
let
me
hope
my
constitution
is
almost
peculiar
my
dear
mother
used
to
say
i
should
never
have
a
comfortable
home
and
only
last
summer
i
proved
myself
perfectly
unworthy
of
one
while
enjoying
a
month
of
fine
weather
at
the
i
was
thrown
into
the
company
of
a
most
fascinating
creature
a
real
goddess
in
my
eyes
as
long
as
she
took
no
notice
of
me
i
told
my
vocally
still
if
looks
have
language
the
merest
idiot
might
have
guessed
i
was
over
head
and
ears
she
understood
me
at
last
and
looked
a
return
the
sweetest
of
all
imaginable
looks
and
what
did
i
do
i
confess
it
with
shame
shrunk
icily
into
myself
like
a
snail
at
every
glance
retired
colder
and
farther
till
finally
the
poor
innocent
was
led
to
doubt
her
own
senses
and
overwhelmed
with
confusion
at
her
supposed
mistake
persuaded
her
mamma
to
decamp
by
this
curious
turn
of
disposition
i
have
gained
the
reputation
of
deliberate
heartlessness
how
undeserved
i
alone
can
appreciate
i
took
a
seat
at
the
end
of
the
hearthstone
opposite
that
towards
which
my
landlord
advanced
and
filled
up
an
interval
of
silence
by
attempting
to
caress
the
canine
mother
who
had
left
her
nursery
and
was
sneaking
wolfishly
to
the
back
of
my
legs
her
lip
curled
up
and
her
white
teeth
watering
for
a
snatch
my
caress
provoked
a
long
guttural
gnarl
better
let
the
dog
alone
growled
heathcliff
in
unison
checking
fiercer
demonstrations
with
a
punch
of
his
foot
not
accustomed
to
be
spoiled
not
kept
for
a
pet
then
striding
to
a
side
door
he
shouted
again
joseph
mumbled
indistinctly
in
the
depths
of
the
cellar
but
gave
no
intimation
of
ascending
so
his
master
dived
down
to
him
leaving
me
the
ruffianly
bitch
and
a
pair
of
grim
shaggy
who
shared
with
her
a
jealous
guardianship
over
all
my
movements
not
anxious
to
come
in
contact
with
their
fangs
i
sat
still
but
imagining
they
would
scarcely
understand
tacit
insults
i
unfortunately
indulged
in
winking
and
making
faces
at
the
trio
and
some
turn
of
my
physiognomy
so
irritated
madam
that
she
suddenly
broke
into
a
fury
and
leapt
on
my
knees
i
flung
her
back
and
hastened
to
interpose
the
table
between
us
this
proceeding
aroused
the
whole
hive
fiends
of
various
sizes
and
ages
issued
from
hidden
dens
to
the
common
centre
i
felt
my
heels
and
peculiar
subjects
of
assault
and
parrying
off
the
larger
combatants
as
effectually
as
i
could
with
the
poker
i
was
constrained
to
demand
aloud
assistance
from
some
of
the
household
in
peace
heathcliff
and
his
man
climbed
the
cellar
steps
with
vexatious
phlegm
i
do
think
they
moved
one
second
faster
than
usual
though
the
hearth
was
an
absolute
tempest
of
worrying
and
yelping
happily
an
inhabitant
of
the
kitchen
made
more
despatch
a
lusty
dame
with
gown
bare
arms
and
cheeks
rushed
into
the
midst
of
us
flourishing
a
and
used
that
weapon
and
her
tongue
to
such
purpose
that
the
storm
subsided
magically
and
she
only
remained
heaving
like
a
sea
after
a
high
wind
when
her
master
entered
on
the
scene
the
devil
is
the
matter
he
asked
eyeing
me
in
a
manner
that
i
could
ill
endure
after
this
inhospitable
treatment
the
devil
indeed
i
muttered
herd
of
possessed
swine
could
have
had
no
worse
spirits
in
them
than
those
animals
of
yours
sir
you
might
as
well
leave
a
stranger
with
a
brood
of
tigers
wo
meddle
with
persons
who
touch
nothing
he
remarked
putting
the
bottle
before
me
and
restoring
the
displaced
table
dogs
do
right
to
be
vigilant
take
a
glass
of
wine
thank
you
bitten
are
you
i
had
been
i
would
have
set
my
signet
on
the
biter
countenance
relaxed
into
a
grin
come
he
said
are
flurried
lockwood
here
take
a
little
wine
guests
are
so
exceedingly
rare
in
this
house
that
i
and
my
dogs
i
am
willing
to
own
hardly
know
how
to
receive
them
your
health
sir
i
bowed
and
returned
the
pledge
beginning
to
perceive
that
it
would
be
foolish
to
sit
sulking
for
the
misbehaviour
of
a
pack
of
curs
besides
i
felt
loth
to
yield
the
fellow
further
amusement
at
my
expense
since
his
humour
took
that
turn
he
probably
swayed
by
prudential
consideration
of
the
folly
of
offending
a
good
tenant
relaxed
a
little
in
the
laconic
style
of
chipping
off
his
pronouns
and
auxiliary
verbs
and
introduced
what
he
supposed
would
be
a
subject
of
interest
to
me
a
discourse
on
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
my
present
place
of
retirement
i
found
him
very
intelligent
on
the
topics
we
touched
and
before
i
went
home
i
was
encouraged
so
far
as
to
volunteer
another
visit
he
evidently
wished
no
repetition
of
my
intrusion
i
shall
go
notwithstanding
it
is
astonishing
how
sociable
i
feel
myself
compared
with
him
chapter
ii
yesterday
afternoon
set
in
misty
and
cold
i
had
half
a
mind
to
spend
it
by
my
study
fire
instead
of
wading
through
heath
and
mud
to
wuthering
heights
on
coming
up
from
dinner
however
i
dine
between
twelve
and
one
the
housekeeper
a
matronly
lady
taken
as
a
fixture
along
with
the
house
could
not
or
would
not
comprehend
my
request
that
i
might
be
served
at
five
on
mounting
the
stairs
with
this
lazy
intention
and
stepping
into
the
room
i
saw
a
on
her
knees
surrounded
by
brushes
and
and
raising
an
infernal
dust
as
she
extinguished
the
flames
with
heaps
of
cinders
this
spectacle
drove
me
back
immediately
i
took
my
hat
and
after
a
walk
arrived
at
heathcliff
just
in
time
to
escape
the
first
feathery
flakes
of
a
on
that
bleak
the
earth
was
hard
with
a
black
frost
and
the
air
made
me
shiver
through
every
limb
being
unable
to
remove
the
chain
i
jumped
over
and
running
up
the
flagged
causeway
bordered
with
straggling
knocked
vainly
for
admittance
till
my
knuckles
tingled
and
the
dogs
howled
inmates
i
ejaculated
mentally
deserve
perpetual
isolation
from
your
species
for
your
churlish
inhospitality
at
least
i
would
not
keep
my
doors
barred
in
the
i
do
care
i
will
get
in
so
resolved
i
grasped
the
latch
and
shook
it
vehemently
joseph
projected
his
head
from
a
round
window
of
the
barn
are
ye
for
he
shouted
maister
down
i

fowld

by
th
end
o

to
spake
to

till

whom
i

joseph
me
i
hae
no
hend
muttered
the
head
vanishing
the
snow
began
to
drive
thickly
i
seized
the
handle
to
essay
another
trial
when
a
young
man
without
coat
and
shouldering
a
pitchfork
appeared
in
the
yard
behind
he
hailed
me
to
follow
him
and
after
marching
through
a
and
a
paved
area
containing
a
pump
and
we
at
length
arrived
in
the
huge
warm
cheerful
apartment
where
i
was
formerly
received
it
glowed
delightfully
in
the
radiance
of
an
immense
fire
compounded
of
coal
peat
and
wood
and
near
the
table
laid
for
a
plentiful
evening
meal
i
was
pleased
to
observe
the
an
individual
whose
existence
i
had
never
previously
suspected
i
bowed
and
waited
thinking
she
would
bid
me
take
a
seat
she
looked
at
me
leaning
back
in
her
chair
and
remained
motionless
and
mute
weather
i
remarked
afraid
heathcliff
the
door
must
bear
the
consequence
of
your
servants
leisure
attendance
i
had
hard
work
to
make
them
hear
me
she
never
opened
her
mouth
i
stared
she
stared
also
at
any
rate
she
kept
her
eyes
on
me
in
a
cool
regardless
manner
exceedingly
embarrassing
and
disagreeable
down
said
the
young
man
gruffly
be
in
soon
i
obeyed
and
hemmed
and
called
the
villain
juno
who
deigned
at
this
second
interview
to
move
the
extreme
tip
of
her
tail
in
token
of
owning
my
acquaintance
beautiful
animal
i
commenced
again
you
intend
parting
with
the
little
ones
madam
are
not
mine
said
the
amiable
hostess
more
repellingly
than
heathcliff
himself
could
have
replied
your
favourites
are
among
these
i
continued
turning
to
an
obscure
cushion
full
of
something
like
cats
strange
choice
of
favourites
she
observed
scornfully
unluckily
it
was
a
heap
of
dead
rabbits
i
hemmed
once
more
and
drew
closer
to
the
hearth
repeating
my
comment
on
the
wildness
of
the
evening
should
not
have
come
out
she
said
rising
and
reaching
from
the
two
of
the
painted
canisters
her
position
before
was
sheltered
from
the
light
now
i
had
a
distinct
view
of
her
whole
figure
and
countenance
she
was
slender
and
apparently
scarcely
past
girlhood
an
admirable
form
and
the
most
exquisite
little
face
that
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
beholding
small
features
very
fair
flaxen
ringlets
or
rather
golden
hanging
loose
on
her
delicate
neck
and
eyes
had
they
been
agreeable
in
expression
that
would
have
been
irresistible
fortunately
for
my
susceptible
heart
the
only
sentiment
they
evinced
hovered
between
scorn
and
a
kind
of
desperation
singularly
unnatural
to
be
detected
there
the
canisters
were
almost
out
of
her
reach
i
made
a
motion
to
aid
her
she
turned
upon
me
as
a
miser
might
turn
if
any
one
attempted
to
assist
him
in
counting
his
gold
do
want
your
help
she
snapped
can
get
them
for
myself
beg
your
pardon
i
hastened
to
reply
you
asked
to
tea
she
demanded
tying
an
apron
over
her
neat
black
frock
and
standing
with
a
spoonful
of
the
leaf
poised
over
the
pot
shall
be
glad
to
have
a
cup
i
answered
you
asked
she
repeated
i
said
half
smiling
are
the
proper
person
to
ask
me
she
flung
the
tea
back
spoon
and
all
and
resumed
her
chair
in
a
pet
her
forehead
corrugated
and
her
red
pushed
out
like
a
ready
to
cry
meanwhile
the
young
man
had
slung
on
to
his
person
a
decidedly
shabby
upper
garment
and
erecting
himself
before
the
blaze
looked
down
on
me
from
the
corner
of
his
eyes
for
all
the
world
as
if
there
were
some
mortal
feud
unavenged
between
us
i
began
to
doubt
whether
he
were
a
servant
or
not
his
dress
and
speech
were
both
rude
entirely
devoid
of
the
superiority
observable
in
and
heathcliff
his
thick
brown
curls
were
rough
and
uncultivated
his
whiskers
encroached
bearishly
over
his
cheeks
and
his
hands
were
embrowned
like
those
of
a
common
labourer
still
his
bearing
was
free
almost
haughty
and
he
showed
none
of
a
domestic
assiduity
in
attending
on
the
lady
of
the
house
in
the
absence
of
clear
proofs
of
his
condition
i
deemed
it
best
to
abstain
from
noticing
his
curious
conduct
and
five
minutes
afterwards
the
entrance
of
heathcliff
relieved
me
in
some
measure
from
my
uncomfortable
state
see
sir
i
am
come
according
to
promise
i
exclaimed
assuming
the
cheerful
i
fear
i
shall
be
for
half
an
hour
if
you
can
afford
me
shelter
during
that
space
an
hour
he
said
shaking
the
white
flakes
from
his
clothes
wonder
you
should
select
the
thick
of
a
to
ramble
about
in
do
you
know
that
you
run
a
risk
of
being
lost
in
the
marshes
people
familiar
with
these
moors
often
miss
their
road
on
such
evenings
and
i
can
tell
you
there
is
no
chance
of
a
change
at
present
i
can
get
a
guide
among
your
lads
and
he
might
stay
at
the
grange
till
morning
could
you
spare
me
one
i
could
not
indeed
well
then
i
must
trust
to
my
own
sagacity
you
going
to
mak
the
tea
demanded
he
of
the
shabby
coat
shifting
his
ferocious
gaze
from
me
to
the
young
lady
to
have
any
she
asked
appealing
to
heathcliff
it
ready
will
you
was
the
answer
uttered
so
savagely
that
i
started
the
tone
in
which
the
words
were
said
revealed
a
genuine
bad
nature
i
no
longer
felt
inclined
to
call
heathcliff
a
capital
fellow
when
the
preparations
were
finished
he
invited
me
with
sir
bring
forward
your
chair
and
we
all
including
the
rustic
youth
drew
round
the
table
an
austere
silence
prevailing
while
we
discussed
our
meal
i
thought
if
i
had
caused
the
cloud
it
was
my
duty
to
make
an
effort
to
dispel
it
they
could
not
every
day
sit
so
grim
and
taciturn
and
it
was
impossible
however
they
might
be
that
the
universal
scowl
they
wore
was
their
countenance
is
strange
i
began
in
the
interval
of
swallowing
one
cup
of
tea
and
receiving
another
is
strange
how
custom
can
mould
our
tastes
and
ideas
many
could
not
imagine
the
existence
of
happiness
in
a
life
of
such
complete
exile
from
the
world
as
you
spend
heathcliff
yet
i
venture
to
say
that
surrounded
by
your
family
and
with
your
amiable
lady
as
the
presiding
genius
over
your
home
and
heart
amiable
lady
he
interrupted
with
an
almost
diabolical
sneer
on
his
face
is
she
my
amiable
lady
heathcliff
your
wife
i
mean
yes
oh
you
would
intimate
that
her
spirit
has
taken
the
post
of
ministering
angel
and
guards
the
fortunes
of
wuthering
heights
even
when
her
body
is
gone
is
that
it
perceiving
myself
in
a
blunder
i
attempted
to
correct
it
i
might
have
seen
there
was
too
great
a
disparity
between
the
ages
of
the
parties
to
make
it
likely
that
they
were
man
and
wife
one
was
about
forty
a
period
of
mental
vigour
at
which
men
seldom
cherish
the
delusion
of
being
married
for
love
by
girls
that
dream
is
reserved
for
the
solace
of
our
declining
years
the
other
did
not
look
seventeen
then
it
flashed
upon
me
clown
at
my
elbow
who
is
drinking
his
tea
out
of
a
basin
and
eating
his
bread
with
unwashed
hands
may
be
her
husband
heathcliff
junior
of
course
here
is
the
consequence
of
being
buried
alive
she
has
thrown
herself
away
upon
that
boor
from
sheer
ignorance
that
better
individuals
existed
a
sad
pity
i
must
beware
how
i
cause
her
to
regret
her
choice
the
last
reflection
may
seem
conceited
it
was
not
my
neighbour
struck
me
as
bordering
on
repulsive
i
knew
through
experience
that
i
was
tolerably
attractive
heathcliff
is
my
said
heathcliff
corroborating
my
surmise
he
turned
as
he
spoke
a
peculiar
look
in
her
direction
a
look
of
hatred
unless
he
has
a
most
perverse
set
of
facial
muscles
that
will
not
like
those
of
other
people
interpret
the
language
of
his
soul
certainly
i
see
now
you
are
the
favoured
possessor
of
the
beneficent
fairy
i
remarked
turning
to
my
neighbour
this
was
worse
than
before
the
youth
grew
crimson
and
clenched
his
fist
with
every
appearance
of
a
meditated
assault
but
he
seemed
to
recollect
himself
presently
and
smothered
the
storm
in
a
brutal
curse
muttered
on
my
behalf
which
however
i
took
care
not
to
notice
in
your
conjectures
sir
observed
my
host
neither
of
us
have
the
privilege
of
owning
your
good
fairy
her
mate
is
dead
i
said
she
was
my
therefore
she
must
have
married
my
son
this
young
man
is
my
son
assuredly
heathcliff
smiled
again
as
if
it
were
rather
too
bold
a
jest
to
attribute
the
paternity
of
that
bear
to
him
name
is
hareton
earnshaw
growled
the
other
i
counsel
you
to
respect
it
shown
no
disrespect
was
my
reply
laughing
internally
at
the
dignity
with
which
he
announced
himself
he
fixed
his
eye
on
me
longer
than
i
cared
to
return
the
stare
for
fear
i
might
be
tempted
either
to
box
his
ears
or
render
my
hilarity
audible
i
began
to
feel
unmistakably
out
of
place
in
that
pleasant
family
circle
the
dismal
spiritual
atmosphere
overcame
and
more
than
neutralised
the
glowing
physical
comforts
round
me
and
i
resolved
to
be
cautious
how
i
ventured
under
those
rafters
a
third
time
the
business
of
eating
being
concluded
and
no
one
uttering
a
word
of
sociable
conversation
i
approached
a
window
to
examine
the
weather
a
sorrowful
sight
i
saw
dark
night
coming
down
prematurely
and
sky
and
hills
mingled
in
one
bitter
whirl
of
wind
and
suffocating
snow
do
think
it
possible
for
me
to
get
home
now
without
a
guide
i
could
not
help
exclaiming
roads
will
be
buried
already
and
if
they
were
bare
i
could
scarcely
distinguish
a
foot
in
advance
drive
those
dozen
sheep
into
the
barn
porch
they
be
covered
if
left
in
the
fold
all
night
and
put
a
plank
before
them
said
heathcliff
must
i
do
i
continued
with
rising
irritation
there
was
no
reply
to
my
question
and
on
looking
round
i
saw
only
joseph
bringing
in
a
pail
of
porridge
for
the
dogs
and
heathcliff
leaning
over
the
fire
diverting
herself
with
burning
a
bundle
of
matches
which
had
fallen
from
the
as
she
restored
the
to
its
place
the
former
when
he
had
deposited
his
burden
took
a
critical
survey
of
the
room
and
in
cracked
tones
grated
out
wonder
how
yah
can
faishion
to
stand
thear
i
idleness
un
war
when
all
on
goan
out
bud
yah
a
nowt
and
it
no
use
talking
yah
niver
mend
ill
ways
but
goa
raight
to
t
divil
like
yer
mother
afore
ye
i
imagined
for
a
moment
that
this
piece
of
eloquence
was
addressed
to
me
and
sufficiently
enraged
stepped
towards
the
aged
rascal
with
an
intention
of
kicking
him
out
of
the
door
heathcliff
however
checked
me
by
her
answer
scandalous
old
hypocrite
she
replied
you
not
afraid
of
being
carried
away
bodily
whenever
you
mention
the
devil
name
i
warn
you
to
refrain
from
provoking
me
or
i
ask
your
abduction
as
a
special
favour
stop
look
here
joseph
she
continued
taking
a
long
dark
book
from
a
shelf
show
you
how
far
i
progressed
in
the
black
art
i
shall
soon
be
competent
to
make
a
clear
house
of
it
the
red
cow
did
die
by
chance
and
your
rheumatism
can
hardly
be
reckoned
among
providential
visitations
wicked
wicked
gasped
the
elder
the
lord
deliver
us
from
evil
reprobate
you
are
a
castaway
be
off
or
i
hurt
you
seriously
i
have
you
all
modelled
in
wax
and
clay
and
the
first
who
passes
the
limits
i
fix
shall
i
not
say
what
he
shall
be
done
to
but
see
go
i
looking
at
you
the
little
witch
put
a
mock
malignity
into
her
beautiful
eyes
and
joseph
trembling
with
sincere
horror
hurried
out
praying
and
ejaculating
as
he
went
i
thought
her
conduct
must
be
prompted
by
a
species
of
dreary
fun
and
now
that
we
were
alone
i
endeavoured
to
interest
her
in
my
distress
heathcliff
i
said
earnestly
must
excuse
me
for
troubling
you
i
presume
because
with
that
face
i
sure
you
can
not
help
being
do
point
out
some
landmarks
by
which
i
may
know
my
way
home
i
have
no
more
idea
how
to
get
there
than
you
would
have
how
to
get
to
london
the
road
you
came
she
answered
ensconcing
herself
in
a
chair
with
a
candle
and
the
long
book
open
before
her
is
brief
advice
but
as
sound
as
i
can
give
if
you
hear
of
me
being
discovered
dead
in
a
bog
or
a
pit
full
of
snow
your
conscience
wo
whisper
that
it
is
partly
your
fault
so
i
can
not
escort
you
they
would
let
me
go
to
the
end
of
the
garden
wall
i
should
be
sorry
to
ask
you
to
cross
the
threshold
for
my
convenience
on
such
a
night
i
cried
want
you
to
tell
me
my
way
not
to
it
or
else
to
persuade
heathcliff
to
give
me
a
guide
there
is
himself
earnshaw
zillah
joseph
and
i
which
would
you
have
there
no
boys
at
the
farm
those
are
all
it
follows
that
i
am
compelled
to
stay
you
may
settle
with
your
host
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
hope
it
will
be
a
lesson
to
you
to
make
no
more
rash
journeys
on
these
hills
cried
heathcliff
stern
voice
from
the
kitchen
entrance
to
staying
here
i
do
keep
accommodations
for
visitors
you
must
share
a
bed
with
hareton
or
joseph
if
you
do
can
sleep
on
a
chair
in
this
room
i
replied
no
a
stranger
is
a
stranger
be
he
rich
or
poor
it
will
not
suit
me
to
permit
any
one
the
range
of
the
place
while
i
am
off
guard
said
the
unmannerly
wretch
with
this
insult
my
patience
was
at
an
end
i
uttered
an
expression
of
disgust
and
pushed
past
him
into
the
yard
running
against
earnshaw
in
my
haste
it
was
so
dark
that
i
could
not
see
the
means
of
exit
and
as
i
wandered
round
i
heard
another
specimen
of
their
civil
behaviour
amongst
each
other
at
first
the
young
man
appeared
about
to
befriend
me
go
with
him
as
far
as
the
park
he
said
go
with
him
to
hell
exclaimed
his
master
or
whatever
relation
he
bore
who
is
to
look
after
the
horses
eh
man
life
is
of
more
consequence
than
one
evening
neglect
of
the
horses
somebody
must
go
murmured
heathcliff
more
kindly
than
i
expected
at
your
command
retorted
hareton
you
set
store
on
him
better
be
quiet
i
hope
his
ghost
will
haunt
you
and
i
hope
heathcliff
will
never
get
another
tenant
till
the
grange
is
a
ruin
she
answered
sharply
hearken
shoo
cursing
on
muttered
joseph
towards
whom
i
had
been
steering
he
sat
within
earshot
milking
the
cows
by
the
light
of
a
lantern
which
i
seized
unceremoniously
and
calling
out
that
i
would
send
it
back
on
the
morrow
rushed
to
the
nearest
postern
maister
he
staling
t
lanthern
shouted
the
ancient
pursuing
my
retreat
gnasher
hey
dog
hey
wolf
holld
him
holld
him
on
opening
the
little
door
two
hairy
monsters
flew
at
my
throat
bearing
me
down
and
extinguishing
the
light
while
a
mingled
guffaw
from
heathcliff
and
hareton
put
the
copestone
on
my
rage
and
humiliation
fortunately
the
beasts
seemed
more
bent
on
stretching
their
paws
and
yawning
and
flourishing
their
tails
than
devouring
me
alive
but
they
would
suffer
no
resurrection
and
i
was
forced
to
lie
till
their
malignant
masters
pleased
to
deliver
me
then
hatless
and
trembling
with
wrath
i
ordered
the
miscreants
to
let
me
out
on
their
peril
to
keep
me
one
minute
longer
with
several
incoherent
threats
of
retaliation
that
in
their
indefinite
depth
of
virulency
smacked
of
king
lear
the
vehemence
of
my
agitation
brought
on
a
copious
bleeding
at
the
nose
and
still
heathcliff
laughed
and
still
i
scolded
i
do
know
what
would
have
concluded
the
scene
had
there
not
been
one
person
at
hand
rather
more
rational
than
myself
and
more
benevolent
than
my
entertainer
this
was
zillah
the
stout
housewife
who
at
length
issued
forth
to
inquire
into
the
nature
of
the
uproar
she
thought
that
some
of
them
had
been
laying
violent
hands
on
me
and
not
daring
to
attack
her
master
she
turned
her
vocal
artillery
against
the
younger
scoundrel
earnshaw
she
cried
wonder
what
you
have
agait
next
are
we
going
to
murder
folk
on
our
very
i
see
this
house
will
never
do
for
me
look
at
t
poor
lad
he
fair
choking
wisht
wisht
you
go
on
so
come
in
and
i
cure
that
there
now
hold
ye
still
with
these
words
she
suddenly
splashed
a
pint
of
icy
water
down
my
neck
and
pulled
me
into
the
kitchen
heathcliff
followed
his
accidental
merriment
expiring
quickly
in
his
habitual
moroseness
i
was
sick
exceedingly
and
dizzy
and
faint
and
thus
compelled
perforce
to
accept
lodgings
under
his
roof
he
told
zillah
to
give
me
a
glass
of
brandy
and
then
passed
on
to
the
inner
room
while
she
condoled
with
me
on
my
sorry
predicament
and
having
obeyed
his
orders
whereby
i
was
somewhat
revived
ushered
me
to
bed
chapter
iii
while
leading
the
way
upstairs
she
recommended
that
i
should
hide
the
candle
and
not
make
a
noise
for
her
master
had
an
odd
notion
about
the
chamber
she
would
put
me
in
and
never
let
anybody
lodge
there
willingly
i
asked
the
reason
she
did
not
know
she
answered
she
had
only
lived
there
a
year
or
two
and
they
had
so
many
queer
goings
on
she
could
not
begin
to
be
curious
too
stupefied
to
be
curious
myself
i
fastened
my
door
and
glanced
round
for
the
bed
the
whole
furniture
consisted
of
a
chair
a
and
a
large
oak
case
with
squares
cut
out
near
the
top
resembling
coach
windows
having
approached
this
structure
i
looked
inside
and
perceived
it
to
be
a
singular
sort
of
couch
very
conveniently
designed
to
obviate
the
necessity
for
every
member
of
the
family
having
a
room
to
himself
in
fact
it
formed
a
little
closet
and
the
ledge
of
a
window
which
it
enclosed
served
as
a
table
i
slid
back
the
panelled
sides
got
in
with
my
light
pulled
them
together
again
and
felt
secure
against
the
vigilance
of
heathcliff
and
every
one
else
the
ledge
where
i
placed
my
candle
had
a
few
mildewed
books
piled
up
in
one
corner
and
it
was
covered
with
writing
scratched
on
the
paint
this
writing
however
was
nothing
but
a
name
repeated
in
all
kinds
of
characters
large
and
small
here
and
there
varied
to
and
then
again
to
in
vapid
listlessness
i
leant
my
head
against
the
window
and
continued
spelling
over
catherine
earnshaw
heathcliff
linton
till
my
eyes
closed
but
they
had
not
rested
five
minutes
when
a
glare
of
white
letters
started
from
the
dark
as
vivid
as
spectres
the
air
swarmed
with
catherines
and
rousing
myself
to
dispel
the
obtrusive
name
i
discovered
my
reclining
on
one
of
the
antique
volumes
and
perfuming
the
place
with
an
odour
of
roasted
i
snuffed
it
off
and
very
ill
at
ease
under
the
influence
of
cold
and
lingering
nausea
sat
up
and
spread
open
the
injured
tome
on
my
knee
it
was
a
testament
in
lean
type
and
smelling
dreadfully
musty
a
bore
the
inscription
earnshaw
her
book
and
a
date
some
quarter
of
a
century
back
i
shut
it
and
took
up
another
and
another
till
i
had
examined
all
catherine
library
was
select
and
its
state
of
dilapidation
proved
it
to
have
been
well
used
though
not
altogether
for
a
legitimate
purpose
scarcely
one
chapter
had
escaped
a
commentary
at
least
the
appearance
of
one
covering
every
morsel
of
blank
that
the
printer
had
left
some
were
detached
sentences
other
parts
took
the
form
of
a
regular
diary
scrawled
in
an
unformed
childish
hand
at
the
top
of
an
extra
page
quite
a
treasure
probably
when
first
lighted
on
i
was
greatly
amused
to
behold
an
excellent
caricature
of
my
friend
joseph
rudely
yet
powerfully
sketched
an
immediate
interest
kindled
within
me
for
the
unknown
catherine
and
i
began
forthwith
to
decipher
her
faded
hieroglyphics
awful
sunday
commenced
the
paragraph
beneath
wish
my
father
were
back
again
hindley
is
a
detestable
substitute
his
conduct
to
heathcliff
is
atrocious
and
i
are
going
to
rebel
we
took
our
initiatory
step
this
evening
day
had
been
flooding
with
rain
we
could
not
go
to
church
so
joseph
must
needs
get
up
a
congregation
in
the
garret
and
while
hindley
and
his
wife
basked
downstairs
before
a
comfortable
fire
doing
anything
but
reading
their
bibles
i
answer
for
it
heathcliff
myself
and
the
unhappy
ploughboy
were
commanded
to
take
our
and
mount
we
were
ranged
in
a
row
on
a
sack
of
corn
groaning
and
shivering
and
hoping
that
joseph
would
shiver
too
so
that
he
might
give
us
a
short
homily
for
his
own
sake
a
vain
idea
the
service
lasted
precisely
three
hours
and
yet
my
brother
had
the
face
to
exclaim
when
he
saw
us
descending
what
done
already
on
sunday
evenings
we
used
to
be
permitted
to
play
if
we
did
not
make
much
noise
now
a
mere
titter
is
sufficient
to
send
us
into
corners
you
forget
you
have
a
master
here
says
the
tyrant
i
demolish
the
first
who
puts
me
out
of
temper
i
insist
on
perfect
sobriety
and
silence
oh
boy
was
that
you
frances
darling
pull
his
hair
as
you
go
by
i
heard
him
snap
his
fingers
frances
pulled
his
hair
heartily
and
then
went
and
seated
herself
on
her
husband
knee
and
there
they
were
like
two
babies
kissing
and
talking
nonsense
by
the
hour
foolish
palaver
that
we
should
be
ashamed
of
we
made
ourselves
as
snug
as
our
means
allowed
in
the
arch
of
the
dresser
i
had
just
fastened
our
pinafores
together
and
hung
them
up
for
a
curtain
when
in
comes
joseph
on
an
errand
from
the
stables
he
tears
down
my
handiwork
boxes
my
ears
and
croaks

this
he
compelled
us
so
to
square
our
positions
that
we
might
receive
from
the
fire
a
dull
ray
to
show
us
the
text
of
the
lumber
he
thrust
upon
us
i
could
not
bear
the
employment
i
took
my
dingy
volume
by
the
scroop
and
hurled
it
into
the
vowing
i
hated
a
good
book
heathcliff
kicked
his
to
the
same
place
then
there
was
a
hubbub
maister
hindley
shouted
our

that
ye

gait
ech
th
owd
man
wad
laced
properly
but
he
goan
hurried
up
from
his
paradise
on
the
hearth
and
seizing
one
of
us
by
the
collar
and
the
other
by
the
arm
hurled
both
into
the
where
joseph
asseverated
owd
nick
would
fetch
us
as
sure
as
we
were
living
and
so
comforted
we
each
sought
a
separate
nook
to
await
his
advent
i
reached
this
book
and
a
pot
of
ink
from
a
shelf
and
pushed
the
ajar
to
give
me
light
and
i
have
got
the
time
on
with
writing
for
twenty
minutes
but
my
companion
is
impatient
and
proposes
that
we
should
appropriate
the
cloak
and
have
a
scamper
on
the
moors
under
its
shelter
a
pleasant
suggestion
and
then
if
the
surly
old
man
come
in
he
may
believe
his
prophecy
verified
we
can
not
be
damper
or
colder
in
the
rain
than
we
are
here
i
suppose
catherine
fulfilled
her
project
for
the
next
sentence
took
up
another
subject
she
waxed
lachrymose
little
did
i
dream
that
hindley
would
ever
make
me
cry
so
she
wrote
head
aches
till
i
can
not
keep
it
on
the
pillow
and
still
i
ca
give
over
poor
heathcliff
hindley
calls
him
a
vagabond
and
wo
let
him
sit
with
us
nor
eat
with
us
any
more
and
he
says
he
and
i
must
not
play
together
and
threatens
to
turn
him
out
of
the
house
if
we
break
his
orders
he
has
been
blaming
our
father
how
dared
he
for
treating
too
liberally
and
swears
he
will
reduce
him
to
his
right
place
i
began
to
nod
drowsily
over
the
dim
page
my
eye
wandered
from
manuscript
to
print
i
saw
a
red
ornamented
title
times
seven
and
the
first
of
the
a
pious
discourse
delivered
by
the
reverend
jabez
branderham
in
the
chapel
of
gimmerden
sough
and
while
i
was
worrying
my
brain
to
guess
what
jabez
branderham
would
make
of
his
subject
i
sank
back
in
bed
and
fell
asleep
alas
for
the
effects
of
bad
tea
and
bad
temper
what
else
could
it
be
that
made
me
pass
such
a
terrible
night
i
do
remember
another
that
i
can
at
all
compare
with
it
since
i
was
capable
of
suffering
i
began
to
dream
almost
before
i
ceased
to
be
sensible
of
my
locality
i
thought
it
was
morning
and
i
had
set
out
on
my
way
home
with
joseph
for
a
guide
the
snow
lay
yards
deep
in
our
road
and
as
we
floundered
on
my
companion
wearied
me
with
constant
reproaches
that
i
had
not
brought
a
pilgrim
staff
telling
me
that
i
could
never
get
into
the
house
without
one
and
boastfully
flourishing
a
cudgel
which
i
understood
to
be
so
denominated
for
a
moment
i
considered
it
absurd
that
i
should
need
such
a
weapon
to
gain
admittance
into
my
own
residence
then
a
new
idea
flashed
across
me
i
was
not
going
there
we
were
journeying
to
hear
the
famous
jabez
branderham
preach
from
the
text
times
seven
and
either
joseph
the
preacher
or
i
had
committed
the
of
the
and
were
to
be
publicly
exposed
and
excommunicated
we
came
to
the
chapel
i
have
passed
it
really
in
my
walks
twice
or
thrice
it
lies
in
a
hollow
between
two
hills
an
elevated
hollow
near
a
swamp
whose
peaty
moisture
is
said
to
answer
all
the
purposes
of
embalming
on
the
few
corpses
deposited
there
the
roof
has
been
kept
whole
hitherto
but
as
the
clergyman
stipend
is
only
twenty
pounds
per
annum
and
a
house
with
two
rooms
threatening
speedily
to
determine
into
one
no
clergyman
will
undertake
the
duties
of
pastor
especially
as
it
is
currently
reported
that
his
flock
would
rather
let
him
starve
than
increase
the
living
by
one
penny
from
their
own
pockets
however
in
my
dream
jabez
had
a
full
and
attentive
congregation
and
he
preached
good
god
what
a
sermon
divided
into
hundred
and
parts
each
fully
equal
to
an
ordinary
address
from
the
pulpit
and
each
discussing
a
separate
sin
where
he
searched
for
them
i
can
not
tell
he
had
his
private
manner
of
interpreting
the
phrase
and
it
seemed
necessary
the
brother
should
sin
different
sins
on
every
occasion
they
were
of
the
most
curious
character
odd
transgressions
that
i
never
imagined
previously
oh
how
weary
i
grow
how
i
writhed
and
yawned
and
nodded
and
revived
how
i
pinched
and
pricked
myself
and
rubbed
my
eyes
and
stood
up
and
sat
down
again
and
nudged
joseph
to
inform
me
if
he
would
have
done
i
was
condemned
to
hear
all
out
finally
he
reached
the
of
the
at
that
crisis
a
sudden
inspiration
descended
on
me
i
was
moved
to
rise
and
denounce
jabez
branderham
as
the
sinner
of
the
sin
that
no
christian
need
pardon
i
exclaimed
here
within
these
four
walls
at
one
stretch
i
have
endured
and
forgiven
the
four
hundred
and
ninety
heads
of
your
discourse
seventy
times
seven
times
have
i
plucked
up
my
hat
and
been
about
to
depart
seventy
times
seven
times
have
you
preposterously
forced
me
to
resume
my
seat
the
four
hundred
and
is
too
much
have
at
him
drag
him
down
and
crush
him
to
atoms
that
the
place
which
knows
him
may
know
him
no
more
art
the
cried
jabez
after
a
solemn
pause
leaning
over
his
cushion
times
seven
times
didst
thou
gapingly
contort
thy
visage
seventy
times
seven
did
i
take
counsel
with
my
soul
lo
this
is
human
weakness
this
also
may
be
absolved
the
first
of
the
is
come
brethren
execute
upon
him
the
judgment
written
such
honour
have
all
his
saints
with
that
concluding
word
the
whole
assembly
exalting
their
staves
rushed
round
me
in
a
body
and
i
having
no
weapon
to
raise
in
commenced
grappling
with
joseph
my
nearest
and
most
ferocious
assailant
for
his
in
the
confluence
of
the
multitude
several
clubs
crossed
blows
aimed
at
me
fell
on
other
sconces
presently
the
whole
chapel
resounded
with
rappings
and
counter
rappings
every
man
hand
was
against
his
neighbour
and
branderham
unwilling
to
remain
idle
poured
forth
his
zeal
in
a
shower
of
loud
taps
on
the
boards
of
the
pulpit
which
responded
so
smartly
that
at
last
to
my
unspeakable
relief
they
woke
me
and
what
was
it
that
had
suggested
the
tremendous
tumult
what
had
played
jabez
part
in
the
row
merely
the
branch
of
a
that
touched
my
lattice
as
the
blast
wailed
by
and
rattled
its
dry
cones
against
the
panes
i
listened
doubtingly
an
instant
detected
the
disturber
then
turned
and
dozed
and
dreamt
again
if
possible
still
more
disagreeably
than
before
this
time
i
remembered
i
was
lying
in
the
oak
closet
and
i
heard
distinctly
the
gusty
wind
and
the
driving
of
the
snow
i
heard
also
the
fir
bough
repeat
its
teasing
sound
and
ascribed
it
to
the
right
cause
but
it
annoyed
me
so
much
that
i
resolved
to
silence
it
if
possible
and
i
thought
i
rose
and
endeavoured
to
unhasp
the
casement
the
hook
was
soldered
into
the
staple
a
circumstance
observed
by
me
when
awake
but
forgotten
must
stop
it
nevertheless
i
muttered
knocking
my
knuckles
through
the
glass
and
stretching
an
arm
out
to
seize
the
importunate
branch
instead
of
which
my
fingers
closed
on
the
fingers
of
a
little
hand
the
intense
horror
of
nightmare
came
over
me
i
tried
to
draw
back
my
arm
but
the
hand
clung
to
it
and
a
most
melancholy
voice
sobbed
me
in
let
me
in
are
you
i
asked
struggling
meanwhile
to
disengage
myself
linton
it
replied
shiveringly
why
did
i
think
of
i
had
read
twenty
times
for
linton
come
home
i
lost
my
way
on
the
moor
as
it
spoke
i
discerned
obscurely
a
child
face
looking
through
the
window
terror
made
me
cruel
and
finding
it
useless
to
attempt
shaking
the
creature
off
i
pulled
its
wrist
on
to
the
broken
pane
and
rubbed
it
to
and
fro
till
the
blood
ran
down
and
soaked
the
bedclothes
still
it
wailed
me
in
and
maintained
its
tenacious
grip
almost
maddening
me
with
fear
can
i
i
said
at
length
go
if
you
want
me
to
let
you
in
the
fingers
relaxed
i
snatched
mine
through
the
hole
hurriedly
piled
the
books
up
in
a
pyramid
against
it
and
stopped
my
ears
to
exclude
the
lamentable
prayer
i
seemed
to
keep
them
closed
above
a
quarter
of
an
hour
yet
the
instant
i
listened
again
there
was
the
doleful
cry
moaning
on
i
shouted
never
let
you
in
not
if
you
beg
for
twenty
years
is
twenty
years
mourned
the
voice
years
i
been
a
waif
for
twenty
years
thereat
began
a
feeble
scratching
outside
and
the
pile
of
books
moved
as
if
thrust
forward
i
tried
to
jump
up
but
could
not
stir
a
limb
and
so
yelled
aloud
in
a
frenzy
of
fright
to
my
confusion
i
discovered
the
yell
was
not
ideal
hasty
footsteps
approached
my
chamber
door
somebody
pushed
it
open
with
a
vigorous
hand
and
a
light
glimmered
through
the
squares
at
the
top
of
the
bed
i
sat
shuddering
yet
and
wiping
the
perspiration
from
my
forehead
the
intruder
appeared
to
hesitate
and
muttered
to
himself
at
last
he
said
in
a
plainly
not
expecting
an
answer
any
one
here
i
considered
it
best
to
confess
my
presence
for
i
knew
heathcliff
accents
and
feared
he
might
search
further
if
i
kept
quiet
with
this
intention
i
turned
and
opened
the
panels
i
shall
not
soon
forget
the
effect
my
action
produced
heathcliff
stood
near
the
entrance
in
his
shirt
and
trousers
with
a
candle
dripping
over
his
fingers
and
his
face
as
white
as
the
wall
behind
him
the
first
creak
of
the
oak
startled
him
like
an
electric
shock
the
light
leaped
from
his
hold
to
a
distance
of
some
feet
and
his
agitation
was
so
extreme
that
he
could
hardly
pick
it
up
is
only
your
guest
sir
i
called
out
desirous
to
spare
him
the
humiliation
of
exposing
his
cowardice
further
had
the
misfortune
to
scream
in
my
sleep
owing
to
a
frightful
nightmare
i
sorry
i
disturbed
you
god
confound
you
lockwood
i
wish
you
were
at
the
commenced
my
host
setting
the
candle
on
a
chair
because
he
found
it
impossible
to
hold
it
steady
who
showed
you
up
into
this
room
he
continued
crushing
his
nails
into
his
palms
and
grinding
his
teeth
to
subdue
the
maxillary
convulsions
was
it
i
a
good
mind
to
turn
them
out
of
the
house
this
moment
was
your
servant
zillah
i
replied
flinging
myself
on
to
the
floor
and
rapidly
resuming
my
garments
should
not
care
if
you
did
heathcliff
she
richly
deserves
it
i
suppose
that
she
wanted
to
get
another
proof
that
the
place
was
haunted
at
my
expense
well
it
is
swarming
with
ghosts
and
goblins
you
have
reason
in
shutting
it
up
i
assure
you
no
one
will
thank
you
for
a
doze
in
such
a
den
do
you
mean
asked
heathcliff
what
are
you
doing
lie
down
and
finish
out
the
night
since
you
here
but
for
heaven
sake
do
repeat
that
horrid
noise
nothing
could
excuse
it
unless
you
were
having
your
throat
cut
the
little
fiend
had
got
in
at
the
window
she
probably
would
have
strangled
me
i
returned
not
going
to
endure
the
persecutions
of
your
hospitable
ancestors
again
was
not
the
reverend
jabez
branderham
akin
to
you
on
the
mother
side
and
that
minx
catherine
linton
or
earnshaw
or
however
she
was
called
she
must
have
been
a
changeling
wicked
little
soul
she
told
me
she
had
been
walking
the
earth
these
twenty
years
a
just
punishment
for
her
mortal
transgressions
i
no
doubt
scarcely
were
these
words
uttered
when
i
recollected
the
association
of
heathcliff
with
catherine
name
in
the
book
which
had
completely
slipped
from
my
memory
till
thus
awakened
i
blushed
at
my
inconsideration
but
without
showing
further
consciousness
of
the
offence
i
hastened
to
add
truth
is
sir
i
passed
the
first
part
of
the
night
in
here
i
stopped
afresh
i
was
about
to
say
those
old
volumes
then
it
would
have
revealed
my
knowledge
of
their
written
as
well
as
their
printed
contents
so
correcting
myself
i
went
on
spelling
over
the
name
scratched
on
that
a
monotonous
occupation
calculated
to
set
me
asleep
like
counting
or
you
mean
by
talking
in
this
way
to
thundered
heathcliff
with
savage
vehemence
how
you
under
my
roof
god
he
mad
to
speak
so
and
he
struck
his
forehead
with
rage
i
did
not
know
whether
to
resent
this
language
or
pursue
my
explanation
but
he
seemed
so
powerfully
affected
that
i
took
pity
and
proceeded
with
my
dreams
affirming
i
had
never
heard
the
appellation
of
linton
before
but
reading
it
often
over
produced
an
impression
which
personified
itself
when
i
had
no
longer
my
imagination
under
control
heathcliff
gradually
fell
back
into
the
shelter
of
the
bed
as
i
spoke
finally
sitting
down
almost
concealed
behind
it
i
guessed
however
by
his
irregular
and
intercepted
breathing
that
he
struggled
to
vanquish
an
excess
of
violent
emotion
not
liking
to
show
him
that
i
had
heard
the
conflict
i
continued
my
toilette
rather
noisily
looked
at
my
watch
and
soliloquised
on
the
length
of
the
night
three
yet
i
could
have
taken
oath
it
had
been
six
time
stagnates
here
we
must
surely
have
retired
to
rest
at
eight
at
nine
in
winter
and
rise
at
four
said
my
host
suppressing
a
groan
and
as
i
fancied
by
the
motion
of
his
arm
shadow
dashing
a
tear
from
his
eyes
lockwood
he
added
may
go
into
my
room
you
only
be
in
the
way
coming
so
early
and
your
childish
outcry
has
sent
sleep
to
the
devil
for
me
for
me
too
i
replied
walk
in
the
yard
till
daylight
and
then
i
be
off
and
you
need
not
dread
a
repetition
of
my
intrusion
i
now
quite
cured
of
seeking
pleasure
in
society
be
it
country
or
town
a
sensible
man
ought
to
find
sufficient
company
in
himself
company
muttered
heathcliff
the
candle
and
go
where
you
please
i
shall
join
you
directly
keep
out
of
the
yard
though
the
dogs
are
unchained
and
the
house
juno
mounts
sentinel
there
and
nay
you
can
only
ramble
about
the
steps
and
passages
but
away
with
you
i
come
in
two
minutes
i
obeyed
so
far
as
to
quit
the
chamber
when
ignorant
where
the
narrow
lobbies
led
i
stood
still
and
was
witness
involuntarily
to
a
piece
of
superstition
on
the
part
of
my
landlord
which
belied
oddly
his
apparent
sense
he
got
on
to
the
bed
and
wrenched
open
the
lattice
bursting
as
he
pulled
at
it
into
an
uncontrollable
passion
of
tears
in
come
in
he
sobbed
do
come
oh
do
more
oh
my
darling
hear
me
time
catherine
at
last
the
spectre
showed
a
spectre
ordinary
caprice
it
gave
no
sign
of
being
but
the
snow
and
wind
whirled
wildly
through
even
reaching
my
station
and
blowing
out
the
light
there
was
such
anguish
in
the
gush
of
grief
that
accompanied
this
raving
that
my
compassion
made
me
overlook
its
folly
and
i
drew
off
half
angry
to
have
listened
at
all
and
vexed
at
having
related
my
ridiculous
nightmare
since
it
produced
that
agony
though
was
beyond
my
comprehension
i
descended
cautiously
to
the
lower
regions
and
landed
in
the
where
a
gleam
of
fire
raked
compactly
together
enabled
me
to
rekindle
my
candle
nothing
was
stirring
except
a
brindled
grey
cat
which
crept
from
the
ashes
and
saluted
me
with
a
querulous
mew
two
benches
shaped
in
sections
of
a
circle
nearly
enclosed
the
hearth
on
one
of
these
i
stretched
myself
and
grimalkin
mounted
the
other
we
were
both
of
us
nodding
ere
any
one
invaded
our
retreat
and
then
it
was
joseph
shuffling
down
a
wooden
ladder
that
vanished
in
the
roof
through
a
trap
the
ascent
to
his
garret
i
suppose
he
cast
a
sinister
look
at
the
little
flame
which
i
had
enticed
to
play
between
the
ribs
swept
the
cat
from
its
elevation
and
bestowing
himself
in
the
vacancy
commenced
the
operation
of
stuffing
a
pipe
with
tobacco
my
presence
in
his
sanctum
was
evidently
esteemed
a
piece
of
impudence
too
shameful
for
remark
he
silently
applied
the
tube
to
his
lips
folded
his
arms
and
puffed
away
i
let
him
enjoy
the
luxury
unannoyed
and
after
sucking
out
his
last
wreath
and
heaving
a
profound
sigh
he
got
up
and
departed
as
solemnly
as
he
came
a
more
elastic
footstep
entered
next
and
now
i
opened
my
mouth
for
a
but
closed
it
again
the
salutation
unachieved
for
hareton
earnshaw
was
performing
his
orison
in
a
series
of
curses
directed
against
every
object
he
touched
while
he
rummaged
a
corner
for
a
spade
or
shovel
to
dig
through
the
drifts
he
glanced
over
the
back
of
the
bench
dilating
his
nostrils
and
thought
as
little
of
exchanging
civilities
with
me
as
with
my
companion
the
cat
i
guessed
by
his
preparations
that
egress
was
allowed
and
leaving
my
hard
couch
made
a
movement
to
follow
him
he
noticed
this
and
thrust
at
an
inner
door
with
the
end
of
his
spade
intimating
by
an
inarticulate
sound
that
there
was
the
place
where
i
must
go
if
i
changed
my
locality
it
opened
into
the
house
where
the
females
were
already
astir
zillah
urging
flakes
of
flame
up
the
chimney
with
a
colossal
bellows
and
heathcliff
kneeling
on
the
hearth
reading
a
book
by
the
aid
of
the
blaze
she
held
her
hand
interposed
between
the
and
her
eyes
and
seemed
absorbed
in
her
occupation
desisting
from
it
only
to
chide
the
servant
for
covering
her
with
sparks
or
to
push
away
a
dog
now
and
then
that
snoozled
its
nose
overforwardly
into
her
face
i
was
surprised
to
see
heathcliff
there
also
he
stood
by
the
fire
his
back
towards
me
just
finishing
a
stormy
scene
with
poor
zillah
who
ever
and
anon
interrupted
her
labour
to
pluck
up
the
corner
of
her
apron
and
heave
an
indignant
groan
you
you
worthless
he
broke
out
as
i
entered
turning
to
his
and
employing
an
epithet
as
harmless
as
duck
or
sheep
but
generally
represented
by
a
dash
you
are
at
your
idle
tricks
again
the
rest
of
them
do
earn
their
bread
you
live
on
my
charity
put
your
trash
away
and
find
something
to
do
you
shall
pay
me
for
the
plague
of
having
you
eternally
in
my
sight
do
you
hear
damnable
jade
put
my
trash
away
because
you
can
make
me
if
i
refuse
answered
the
young
lady
closing
her
book
and
throwing
it
on
a
chair
not
do
anything
though
you
should
swear
your
tongue
out
except
what
i
please
heathcliff
lifted
his
hand
and
the
speaker
sprang
to
a
safer
distance
obviously
acquainted
with
its
weight
having
no
desire
to
be
entertained
by
a
combat
i
stepped
forward
briskly
as
if
eager
to
partake
the
warmth
of
the
hearth
and
innocent
of
any
knowledge
of
the
interrupted
dispute
each
had
enough
decorum
to
suspend
further
hostilities
heathcliff
placed
his
fists
out
of
temptation
in
his
pockets
heathcliff
curled
her
lip
and
walked
to
a
seat
far
off
where
she
kept
her
word
by
playing
the
part
of
a
statue
during
the
remainder
of
my
stay
that
was
not
long
i
declined
joining
their
breakfast
and
at
the
first
gleam
of
dawn
took
an
opportunity
of
escaping
into
the
free
air
now
clear
and
still
and
cold
as
impalpable
ice
my
landlord
halloed
for
me
to
stop
ere
i
reached
the
bottom
of
the
garden
and
offered
to
accompany
me
across
the
moor
it
was
well
he
did
for
the
whole
was
one
billowy
white
ocean
the
swells
and
falls
not
indicating
corresponding
rises
and
depressions
in
the
ground
many
pits
at
least
were
filled
to
a
level
and
entire
ranges
of
mounds
the
refuse
of
the
quarries
blotted
from
the
chart
which
my
walk
left
pictured
in
my
mind
i
had
remarked
on
one
side
of
the
road
at
intervals
of
six
or
seven
yards
a
line
of
upright
stones
continued
through
the
whole
length
of
the
barren
these
were
erected
and
daubed
with
lime
on
purpose
to
serve
as
guides
in
the
dark
and
also
when
a
fall
like
the
present
confounded
the
deep
swamps
on
either
hand
with
the
firmer
path
but
excepting
a
dirty
dot
pointing
up
here
and
there
all
traces
of
their
existence
had
vanished
and
my
companion
found
it
necessary
to
warn
me
frequently
to
steer
to
the
right
or
left
when
i
imagined
i
was
following
correctly
the
windings
of
the
road
we
exchanged
little
conversation
and
he
halted
at
the
entrance
of
thrushcross
park
saying
i
could
make
no
error
there
our
adieux
were
limited
to
a
hasty
bow
and
then
i
pushed
forward
trusting
to
my
own
resources
for
the
porter
lodge
is
untenanted
as
yet
the
distance
from
the
gate
to
the
grange
is
two
miles
i
believe
i
managed
to
make
it
four
what
with
losing
myself
among
the
trees
and
sinking
up
to
the
neck
in
snow
a
predicament
which
only
those
who
have
experienced
it
can
appreciate
at
any
rate
whatever
were
my
wanderings
the
clock
chimed
twelve
as
i
entered
the
house
and
that
gave
exactly
an
hour
for
every
mile
of
the
usual
way
from
wuthering
heights
my
human
fixture
and
her
satellites
rushed
to
welcome
me
exclaiming
tumultuously
they
had
completely
given
me
up
everybody
conjectured
that
i
perished
last
night
and
they
were
wondering
how
they
must
set
about
the
search
for
my
remains
i
bid
them
be
quiet
now
that
they
saw
me
returned
and
benumbed
to
my
very
heart
i
dragged
whence
after
putting
on
dry
clothes
and
pacing
to
and
fro
thirty
or
forty
minutes
to
restore
the
animal
heat
i
adjourned
to
my
study
feeble
as
a
kitten
almost
too
much
so
to
enjoy
the
cheerful
fire
and
smoking
coffee
which
the
servant
had
prepared
for
my
refreshment
chapter
iv
what
vain
weathercocks
we
are
i
who
had
determined
to
hold
myself
independent
of
all
social
intercourse
and
thanked
my
stars
that
at
length
i
had
lighted
on
a
spot
where
it
was
next
to
impracticable
i
weak
wretch
after
maintaining
till
dusk
a
struggle
with
low
spirits
and
solitude
was
finally
compelled
to
strike
my
colours
and
under
pretence
of
gaining
information
concerning
the
necessities
of
my
establishment
i
desired
dean
when
she
brought
in
supper
to
sit
down
while
i
ate
it
hoping
sincerely
she
would
prove
a
regular
gossip
and
either
rouse
me
to
animation
or
lull
me
to
sleep
by
her
talk
have
lived
here
a
considerable
time
i
commenced
you
not
say
sixteen
years
sir
i
came
when
the
mistress
was
married
to
wait
on
her
after
she
died
the
master
retained
me
for
his
housekeeper
there
ensued
a
pause
she
was
not
a
gossip
i
feared
unless
about
her
own
affairs
and
those
could
hardly
interest
me
however
having
studied
for
an
interval
with
a
fist
on
either
knee
and
a
cloud
of
meditation
over
her
ruddy
countenance
she
ejaculated
times
are
greatly
changed
since
then
i
remarked
seen
a
good
many
alterations
i
suppose
have
and
troubles
too
she
said
i
turn
the
talk
on
my
landlord
family
i
thought
to
myself
good
subject
to
start
and
that
pretty
i
should
like
to
know
her
history
whether
she
be
a
native
of
the
country
or
as
is
more
probable
an
exotic
that
the
surly
will
not
recognise
for
kin
with
this
intention
i
asked
dean
why
heathcliff
let
thrushcross
grange
and
preferred
living
in
a
situation
and
residence
so
much
inferior
he
not
rich
enough
to
keep
the
estate
in
good
order
i
inquired
sir
she
returned
has
nobody
knows
what
money
and
every
year
it
increases
yes
yes
he
rich
enough
to
live
in
a
finer
house
than
this
but
he
very
near
and
if
he
had
meant
to
flit
to
thrushcross
grange
as
soon
as
he
heard
of
a
good
tenant
he
could
not
have
borne
to
miss
the
chance
of
getting
a
few
hundreds
more
it
is
strange
people
should
be
so
greedy
when
they
are
alone
in
the
world
had
a
son
it
seems
he
had
one
he
is
dead
that
young
lady
heathcliff
is
his
widow
did
she
come
from
originally
sir
she
is
my
late
master
daughter
catherine
linton
was
her
maiden
name
i
nursed
her
poor
thing
i
did
wish
heathcliff
would
remove
here
and
then
we
might
have
been
together
again
catherine
linton
i
exclaimed
astonished
but
a
reflection
convinced
me
it
was
not
my
ghostly
catherine
i
continued
predecessor
name
was
linton
was
who
is
that
earnshaw
hareton
earnshaw
who
lives
with
heathcliff

they
relations

is
the
late
linton
nephew

and
her
husband

her
cousin
also

on
the
mother
the
other
on
the
father
side
heathcliff
married
linton
sister
see
the
house
at
wuthering
heights
has
earnshaw
carved
over
the
front
door
are
they
an
old
family
old
sir
and
hareton
is
the
last
of
them
as
our
miss
cathy
is
of
us
i
mean
of
the
lintons
have
you
been
to
wuthering
heights
i
beg
pardon
for
asking
but
i
should
like
to
hear
how
she
is
heathcliff
she
looked
very
well
and
very
handsome
yet
i
think
not
very
happy
dear
i
do
wonder
and
how
did
you
like
the
master
rough
fellow
rather
dean
is
not
that
his
character
as
a
and
hard
as
whinstone
the
less
you
meddle
with
him
the
better
must
have
had
some
ups
and
downs
in
life
to
make
him
such
a
churl
do
you
know
anything
of
his
history
a
cuckoo
sir
i
know
all
about
it
except
where
he
was
born
and
who
were
his
parents
and
how
he
got
his
money
at
first
and
hareton
has
been
cast
out
like
an
unfledged
dunnock
the
unfortunate
lad
is
the
only
one
in
all
this
parish
that
does
not
guess
how
he
has
been
cheated
dean
it
will
be
a
charitable
deed
to
tell
me
something
of
my
neighbours
i
feel
i
shall
not
rest
if
i
go
to
bed
so
be
good
enough
to
sit
and
chat
an
hour
certainly
sir
i
just
fetch
a
little
sewing
and
then
i
sit
as
long
as
you
please
but
you
caught
cold
i
saw
you
shivering
and
you
must
have
some
gruel
to
drive
it
out
the
worthy
woman
bustled
off
and
i
crouched
nearer
the
fire
my
head
felt
hot
and
the
rest
of
me
chill
moreover
i
was
excited
almost
to
a
pitch
of
foolishness
through
my
nerves
and
brain
this
caused
me
to
feel
not
uncomfortable
but
rather
fearful
as
i
am
still
of
serious
effects
from
the
incidents
of
and
yesterday
she
returned
presently
bringing
a
smoking
basin
and
a
basket
of
work
and
having
placed
the
former
on
the
hob
drew
in
her
seat
evidently
pleased
to
find
me
so
companionable
before
i
came
to
live
here
she
commenced
waiting
no
farther
invitation
to
her
story
i
was
almost
always
at
wuthering
heights
because
my
mother
had
nursed
hindley
earnshaw
that
was
hareton
father
and
i
got
used
to
playing
with
the
children
i
ran
errands
too
and
helped
to
make
hay
and
hung
about
the
farm
ready
for
anything
that
anybody
would
set
me
to
one
fine
summer
morning
it
was
the
beginning
of
harvest
i
remember
earnshaw
the
old
master
came
dressed
for
a
journey
and
after
he
had
told
joseph
what
was
to
be
done
during
the
day
he
turned
to
hindley
and
cathy
and
me
for
i
sat
eating
my
porridge
with
them
and
he
said
speaking
to
his
son
my
bonny
man
i
going
to
liverpool
what
shall
i
bring
you
you
may
choose
what
you
like
only
let
it
be
little
for
i
shall
walk
there
and
back
sixty
miles
each
way
that
is
a
long
spell
hindley
named
a
fiddle
and
then
he
asked
miss
cathy
she
was
hardly
six
years
old
but
she
could
ride
any
horse
in
the
stable
and
she
chose
a
whip
he
did
not
forget
me
for
he
had
a
kind
heart
though
he
was
rather
severe
sometimes
he
promised
to
bring
me
a
pocketful
of
apples
and
pears
and
then
he
kissed
his
children
said
and
set
off
it
seemed
a
long
while
to
us
all
the
three
days
of
his
absence
and
often
did
little
cathy
ask
when
he
would
be
home
earnshaw
expected
him
by
on
the
third
evening
and
she
put
the
meal
off
hour
after
hour
there
were
no
signs
of
his
coming
however
and
at
last
the
children
got
tired
of
running
down
to
the
gate
to
look
then
it
grew
dark
she
would
have
had
them
to
bed
but
they
begged
sadly
to
be
allowed
to
stay
up
and
just
about
eleven
the
was
raised
quietly
and
in
stepped
the
master
he
threw
himself
into
a
chair
laughing
and
groaning
and
bid
them
all
stand
off
for
he
was
nearly
killed
he
would
not
have
such
another
walk
for
the
three
kingdoms
at
the
end
of
it
to
be
flighted
to
death
he
said
opening
his
which
he
held
bundled
up
in
his
arms
here
wife
i
was
never
so
beaten
with
anything
in
my
life
but
you
must
take
it
as
a
gift
of
god
though
it
as
dark
almost
as
if
it
came
from
the
devil
we
crowded
round
and
over
miss
cathy
head
i
had
a
peep
at
a
dirty
ragged
child
big
enough
both
to
walk
and
talk
indeed
its
face
looked
older
than
catherine
yet
when
it
was
set
on
its
feet
it
only
stared
round
and
repeated
over
and
over
again
some
gibberish
that
nobody
could
understand
i
was
frightened
and
earnshaw
was
ready
to
fling
it
out
of
doors
she
did
fly
up
asking
how
he
could
fashion
to
bring
that
gipsy
brat
into
the
house
when
they
had
their
own
bairns
to
feed
and
fend
for
what
he
meant
to
do
with
it
and
whether
he
were
mad
the
master
tried
to
explain
the
matter
but
he
was
really
half
dead
with
fatigue
and
all
that
i
could
make
out
amongst
her
scolding
was
a
tale
of
his
seeing
it
starving
and
houseless
and
as
good
as
dumb
in
the
streets
of
liverpool
where
he
picked
it
up
and
inquired
for
its
owner
not
a
soul
knew
to
whom
it
belonged
he
said
and
his
money
and
time
being
both
limited
he
thought
it
better
to
take
it
home
with
him
at
once
than
run
into
vain
expenses
there
because
he
was
determined
he
would
not
leave
it
as
he
found
it
well
the
conclusion
was
that
my
mistress
grumbled
herself
calm
and
earnshaw
told
me
to
wash
it
and
give
it
clean
things
and
let
it
sleep
with
the
children
hindley
and
cathy
contented
themselves
with
looking
and
listening
till
peace
was
restored
then
both
began
searching
their
father
pockets
for
the
presents
he
had
promised
them
the
former
was
a
boy
of
fourteen
but
when
he
drew
out
what
had
been
a
fiddle
crushed
to
morsels
in
the
he
blubbered
aloud
and
cathy
when
she
learned
the
master
had
lost
her
whip
in
attending
on
the
stranger
showed
her
humour
by
grinning
and
spitting
at
the
stupid
little
thing
earning
for
her
pains
a
sound
blow
from
her
father
to
teach
her
cleaner
manners
they
entirely
refused
to
have
it
in
bed
with
them
or
even
in
their
room
and
i
had
no
more
sense
so
i
put
it
on
the
landing
of
the
stairs
hoping
it
might
be
gone
on
the
morrow
by
chance
or
else
attracted
by
hearing
his
voice
it
crept
to
earnshaw
door
and
there
he
found
it
on
quitting
his
chamber
inquiries
were
made
as
to
how
it
got
there
i
was
obliged
to
confess
and
in
recompense
for
my
cowardice
and
inhumanity
was
sent
out
of
the
house
this
was
heathcliff
first
introduction
to
the
family
on
coming
back
a
few
days
afterwards
for
i
did
not
consider
my
banishment
perpetual
i
found
they
had
christened
him
it
was
the
name
of
a
son
who
died
in
childhood
and
it
has
served
him
ever
since
both
for
christian
and
surname
miss
cathy
and
he
were
now
very
thick
but
hindley
hated
him
and
to
say
the
truth
i
did
the
same
and
we
plagued
and
went
on
with
him
shamefully
for
i
was
reasonable
enough
to
feel
my
injustice
and
the
mistress
never
put
in
a
word
on
his
behalf
when
she
saw
him
wronged
he
seemed
a
sullen
patient
child
hardened
perhaps
to
he
would
stand
hindley
blows
without
winking
or
shedding
a
tear
and
my
pinches
moved
him
only
to
draw
in
a
breath
and
open
his
eyes
as
if
he
had
hurt
himself
by
accident
and
nobody
was
to
blame
this
endurance
made
old
earnshaw
furious
when
he
discovered
his
son
persecuting
the
poor
fatherless
child
as
he
called
him
he
took
to
heathcliff
strangely
believing
all
he
said
for
that
matter
he
said
precious
little
and
generally
the
truth
and
petting
him
up
far
above
cathy
who
was
too
mischievous
and
wayward
for
a
favourite
so
from
the
very
beginning
he
bred
bad
feeling
in
the
house
and
at
earnshaw
death
which
happened
in
less
than
two
years
after
the
young
master
had
learned
to
regard
his
father
as
an
oppressor
rather
than
a
friend
and
heathcliff
as
a
usurper
of
his
parent
affections
and
his
privileges
and
he
grew
bitter
with
brooding
over
these
injuries
i
sympathised
a
while
but
when
the
children
fell
ill
of
the
measles
and
i
had
to
tend
them
and
take
on
me
the
cares
of
a
woman
at
once
i
changed
my
idea
heathcliff
was
dangerously
sick
and
while
he
lay
at
the
worst
he
would
have
me
constantly
by
his
pillow
i
suppose
he
felt
i
did
a
good
deal
for
him
and
he
had
wit
to
guess
that
i
was
compelled
to
do
it
however
i
will
say
this
he
was
the
quietest
child
that
ever
nurse
watched
over
the
difference
between
him
and
the
others
forced
me
to
be
less
partial
cathy
and
her
brother
harassed
me
terribly
he
was
as
uncomplaining
as
a
lamb
though
hardness
not
gentleness
made
him
give
little
trouble
he
got
through
and
the
doctor
affirmed
it
was
in
a
great
measure
owing
to
me
and
praised
me
for
my
care
i
was
vain
of
his
commendations
and
softened
towards
the
being
by
whose
means
i
earned
them
and
thus
hindley
lost
his
last
ally
still
i
could
dote
on
heathcliff
and
i
wondered
often
what
my
master
saw
to
admire
so
much
in
the
sullen
boy
who
never
to
my
recollection
repaid
his
indulgence
by
any
sign
of
gratitude
he
was
not
insolent
to
his
benefactor
he
was
simply
insensible
though
knowing
perfectly
the
hold
he
had
on
his
heart
and
conscious
he
had
only
to
speak
and
all
the
house
would
be
obliged
to
bend
to
his
wishes
as
an
instance
i
remember
earnshaw
once
bought
a
couple
of
colts
at
the
parish
fair
and
gave
the
lads
each
one
heathcliff
took
the
handsomest
but
it
soon
fell
lame
and
when
he
discovered
it
he
said
to
hindley
must
exchange
horses
with
me
i
do
like
mine
and
if
you
wo
i
shall
tell
your
father
of
the
three
thrashings
you
given
me
this
week
and
show
him
my
arm
which
is
black
to
the
shoulder
hindley
put
out
his
tongue
and
cuffed
him
over
the
ears
better
do
it
at
once
he
persisted
escaping
to
the
porch
they
were
in
the
stable
will
have
to
and
if
i
speak
of
these
blows
you
get
them
again
with
interest
dog
cried
hindley
threatening
him
with
an
iron
weight
used
for
weighing
potatoes
and
hay
it
he
replied
standing
still
then
i
tell
how
you
boasted
that
you
would
turn
me
out
of
doors
as
soon
as
he
died
and
see
whether
he
will
not
turn
you
out
directly
hindley
threw
it
hitting
him
on
the
breast
and
down
he
fell
but
staggered
up
immediately
breathless
and
white
and
had
not
i
prevented
it
he
would
have
gone
just
so
to
the
master
and
got
full
revenge
by
letting
his
condition
plead
for
him
intimating
who
had
caused
it
my
colt
gipsy
then
said
young
earnshaw
i
pray
that
he
may
break
your
neck
take
him
and
be
damned
you
beggarly
interloper
and
wheedle
my
father
out
of
all
he
has
only
afterwards
show
him
what
you
are
imp
of
and
take
that
i
hope
he
kick
out
your
brains
heathcliff
had
gone
to
loose
the
beast
and
shift
it
to
his
own
stall
he
was
passing
behind
it
when
hindley
finished
his
speech
by
knocking
him
under
its
feet
and
without
stopping
to
examine
whether
his
hopes
were
fulfilled
ran
away
as
fast
as
he
could
i
was
surprised
to
witness
how
coolly
the
child
gathered
himself
up
and
went
on
with
his
intention
exchanging
saddles
and
all
and
then
sitting
down
on
a
bundle
of
hay
to
overcome
the
qualm
which
the
violent
blow
occasioned
before
he
entered
the
house
i
persuaded
him
easily
to
let
me
lay
the
blame
of
his
bruises
on
the
horse
he
minded
little
what
tale
was
told
since
he
had
what
he
wanted
he
complained
so
seldom
indeed
of
such
stirs
as
these
that
i
really
thought
him
not
vindictive
i
was
deceived
completely
as
you
will
hear
chapter
v
in
the
course
of
time
earnshaw
began
to
fail
he
had
been
active
and
healthy
yet
his
strength
left
him
suddenly
and
when
he
was
confined
to
the
he
grew
grievously
irritable
a
nothing
vexed
him
and
suspected
slights
of
his
authority
nearly
threw
him
into
fits
this
was
especially
to
be
remarked
if
any
one
attempted
to
impose
upon
or
domineer
over
his
favourite
he
was
painfully
jealous
lest
a
word
should
be
spoken
amiss
to
him
seeming
to
have
got
into
his
head
the
notion
that
because
he
liked
heathcliff
all
hated
and
longed
to
do
him
an
it
was
a
disadvantage
to
the
lad
for
the
kinder
among
us
did
not
wish
to
fret
the
master
so
we
humoured
his
partiality
and
that
humouring
was
rich
nourishment
to
the
child
pride
and
black
tempers
still
it
became
in
a
manner
necessary
twice
or
thrice
hindley
manifestation
of
scorn
while
his
father
was
near
roused
the
old
man
to
a
fury
he
seized
his
stick
to
strike
him
and
shook
with
rage
that
he
could
not
do
it
at
last
our
curate
we
had
a
curate
then
who
made
the
living
answer
by
teaching
the
little
lintons
and
earnshaws
and
farming
his
bit
of
land
himself
advised
that
the
young
man
should
be
sent
to
college
and
earnshaw
agreed
though
with
a
heavy
spirit
for
he
said
was
nought
and
would
never
thrive
as
where
he
wandered
i
hoped
heartily
we
should
have
peace
now
it
hurt
me
to
think
the
master
should
be
made
uncomfortable
by
his
own
good
deed
i
fancied
the
discontent
of
age
and
disease
arose
from
his
family
disagreements
as
he
would
have
it
that
it
did
really
you
know
sir
it
was
in
his
sinking
frame
we
might
have
got
on
tolerably
notwithstanding
but
for
two
people
miss
cathy
and
joseph
the
servant
you
saw
him
i
daresay
up
yonder
he
was
and
is
yet
most
likely
the
wearisomest
pharisee
that
ever
ransacked
a
bible
to
rake
the
promises
to
himself
and
fling
the
curses
to
his
neighbours
by
his
knack
of
sermonising
and
pious
discoursing
he
contrived
to
make
a
great
impression
on
earnshaw
and
the
more
feeble
the
master
became
the
more
influence
he
gained
he
was
relentless
in
worrying
him
about
his
soul
concerns
and
about
ruling
his
children
rigidly
he
encouraged
him
to
regard
hindley
as
a
reprobate
and
night
after
night
he
regularly
grumbled
out
a
long
string
of
tales
against
heathcliff
and
catherine
always
minding
to
flatter
earnshaw
weakness
by
heaping
the
heaviest
blame
on
the
latter
certainly
she
had
ways
with
her
such
as
i
never
saw
a
child
take
up
before
and
she
put
all
of
us
past
our
patience
fifty
times
and
oftener
in
a
day
from
the
hour
she
came
till
the
hour
she
went
to
bed
we
had
not
a
minute
security
that
she
would
be
in
mischief
her
spirits
were
always
at
mark
her
tongue
always
going
singing
laughing
and
plaguing
everybody
who
would
not
do
the
same
a
wild
wicked
slip
she
was
but
she
had
the
bonniest
eye
the
sweetest
smile
and
lightest
foot
in
the
parish
and
after
all
i
believe
she
meant
no
harm
for
when
once
she
made
you
cry
in
good
earnest
it
seldom
happened
that
she
would
not
keep
you
company
and
oblige
you
to
be
quiet
that
you
might
comfort
her
she
was
much
too
fond
of
heathcliff
the
greatest
punishment
we
could
invent
for
her
was
to
keep
her
separate
from
him
yet
she
got
chided
more
than
any
of
us
on
his
account
in
play
she
liked
exceedingly
to
act
the
little
mistress
using
her
hands
freely
and
commanding
her
companions
she
did
so
to
me
but
i
would
not
bear
slapping
and
ordering
and
so
i
let
her
know
now
earnshaw
did
not
understand
jokes
from
his
children
he
had
always
been
strict
and
grave
with
them
and
catherine
on
her
part
had
no
idea
why
her
father
should
be
crosser
and
less
patient
in
his
ailing
condition
than
he
was
in
his
prime
his
peevish
reproofs
wakened
in
her
a
naughty
delight
to
provoke
him
she
was
never
so
happy
as
when
we
were
all
scolding
her
at
once
and
she
defying
us
with
her
bold
saucy
look
and
her
ready
words
turning
joseph
religious
curses
into
ridicule
baiting
me
and
doing
just
what
her
father
hated
most
showing
how
her
pretended
insolence
which
he
thought
real
had
more
power
over
heathcliff
than
his
kindness
how
the
boy
would
do
bidding
in
anything
and
only
when
it
suited
his
own
inclination
after
behaving
as
badly
as
possible
all
day
she
sometimes
came
fondling
to
make
it
up
at
night
cathy
the
old
man
would
say
can
not
love
thee
worse
than
thy
brother
go
say
thy
prayers
child
and
ask
god
pardon
i
doubt
thy
mother
and
i
must
rue
that
we
ever
reared
thee
that
made
her
cry
at
first
and
then
being
repulsed
continually
hardened
her
and
she
laughed
if
i
told
her
to
say
she
was
sorry
for
her
faults
and
beg
to
be
forgiven
but
the
hour
came
at
last
that
ended
earnshaw
troubles
on
earth
he
died
quietly
in
his
chair
one
october
evening
seated
by
the
a
high
wind
blustered
round
the
house
and
roared
in
the
chimney
it
sounded
wild
and
stormy
yet
it
was
not
cold
and
we
were
all
together
i
a
little
removed
from
the
hearth
busy
at
my
knitting
and
joseph
reading
his
bible
near
the
table
for
the
servants
generally
sat
in
the
house
then
after
their
work
was
done
miss
cathy
had
been
sick
and
that
made
her
still
she
leant
against
her
father
knee
and
heathcliff
was
lying
on
the
floor
with
his
head
in
her
lap
i
remember
the
master
before
he
fell
into
a
doze
stroking
her
bonny
hair
it
pleased
him
rarely
to
see
her
gentle
and
saying
canst
thou
not
always
be
a
good
lass
cathy
and
she
turned
her
face
up
to
his
and
laughed
and
answered
can
not
you
always
be
a
good
man
father
but
as
soon
as
she
saw
him
vexed
again
she
kissed
his
hand
and
said
she
would
sing
him
to
sleep
she
began
singing
very
low
till
his
fingers
dropped
from
hers
and
his
head
sank
on
his
breast
then
i
told
her
to
hush
and
not
stir
for
fear
she
should
wake
him
we
all
kept
as
mute
as
mice
a
full
and
should
have
done
so
longer
only
joseph
having
finished
his
chapter
got
up
and
said
that
he
must
rouse
the
master
for
prayers
and
bed
he
stepped
forward
and
called
him
by
name
and
touched
his
shoulder
but
he
would
not
move
so
he
took
the
candle
and
looked
at
him
i
thought
there
was
something
wrong
as
he
set
down
the
light
and
seizing
the
children
each
by
an
arm
whispered
them
to
and
make
little
din
they
might
pray
alone
that
evening
he
had
summut
to
do
shall
bid
father
first
said
catherine
putting
her
arms
round
his
neck
before
we
could
hinder
her
the
poor
thing
discovered
her
loss
directly
she
screamed
out
he
dead
heathcliff
dead
and
they
both
set
up
a
cry
i
joined
my
wail
to
theirs
loud
and
bitter
but
joseph
asked
what
we
could
be
thinking
of
to
roar
in
that
way
over
a
saint
in
heaven
he
told
me
to
put
on
my
cloak
and
run
to
gimmerton
for
the
doctor
and
the
parson
i
could
not
guess
the
use
that
either
would
be
of
then
however
i
went
through
wind
and
rain
and
brought
one
the
doctor
back
with
me
the
other
said
he
would
come
in
the
morning
leaving
joseph
to
explain
matters
i
ran
to
the
children
room
their
door
was
ajar
i
saw
they
had
never
lain
down
though
it
was
past
midnight
but
they
were
calmer
and
did
not
need
me
to
console
them
the
little
souls
were
comforting
each
other
with
better
thoughts
than
i
could
have
hit
on
no
parson
in
the
world
ever
pictured
heaven
so
beautifully
as
they
did
in
their
innocent
talk
and
while
i
sobbed
and
listened
i
could
not
help
wishing
we
were
all
there
safe
together
chapter
vi
hindley
came
home
to
the
funeral
and
a
thing
that
amazed
us
and
set
the
neighbours
gossiping
right
and
left
he
brought
a
wife
with
him
what
she
was
and
where
she
was
born
he
never
informed
us
probably
she
had
neither
money
nor
name
to
recommend
her
or
he
would
scarcely
have
kept
the
union
from
his
father
she
was
not
one
that
would
have
disturbed
the
house
much
on
her
own
account
every
object
she
saw
the
moment
she
crossed
the
threshold
appeared
to
delight
her
and
every
circumstance
that
took
place
about
her
except
the
preparing
for
the
burial
and
the
presence
of
the
mourners
i
thought
she
was
half
silly
from
her
behaviour
while
that
went
on
she
ran
into
her
chamber
and
made
me
come
with
her
though
i
should
have
been
dressing
the
children
and
there
she
sat
shivering
and
clasping
her
hands
and
asking
repeatedly
they
gone
yet
then
she
began
describing
with
hysterical
emotion
the
effect
it
produced
on
her
to
see
black
and
started
and
trembled
and
at
last
fell
and
when
i
asked
what
was
the
matter
answered
she
did
know
but
she
felt
so
afraid
of
dying
i
imagined
her
as
little
likely
to
die
as
myself
she
was
rather
thin
but
young
and
and
her
eyes
sparkled
as
bright
as
diamonds
i
did
remark
to
be
sure
that
mounting
the
stairs
made
her
breathe
very
quick
that
the
least
sudden
noise
set
her
all
in
a
quiver
and
that
she
coughed
troublesomely
sometimes
but
i
knew
nothing
of
what
these
symptoms
portended
and
had
no
impulse
to
sympathise
with
her
we
do
in
general
take
to
foreigners
here
lockwood
unless
they
take
to
us
first
young
earnshaw
was
altered
considerably
in
the
three
years
of
his
absence
he
had
grown
sparer
and
lost
his
colour
and
spoke
and
dressed
quite
differently
and
on
the
very
day
of
his
return
he
told
joseph
and
me
we
must
thenceforth
quarter
ourselves
in
the
and
leave
the
house
for
him
indeed
he
would
have
carpeted
and
papered
a
small
spare
room
for
a
parlour
but
his
wife
expressed
such
pleasure
at
the
white
floor
and
huge
glowing
fireplace
at
the
pewter
dishes
and
and
and
the
wide
space
there
was
to
move
about
in
where
they
usually
sat
that
he
thought
it
unnecessary
to
her
comfort
and
so
dropped
the
intention
she
expressed
pleasure
too
at
finding
a
sister
among
her
new
acquaintance
and
she
prattled
to
catherine
and
kissed
her
and
ran
about
with
her
and
gave
her
quantities
of
presents
at
the
beginning
her
affection
tired
very
soon
however
and
when
she
grew
peevish
hindley
became
tyrannical
a
few
words
from
her
evincing
a
dislike
to
heathcliff
were
enough
to
rouse
in
him
all
his
old
hatred
of
the
boy
he
drove
him
from
their
company
to
the
servants
deprived
him
of
the
instructions
of
the
curate
and
insisted
that
he
should
labour
out
of
doors
instead
compelling
him
to
do
so
as
hard
as
any
other
lad
on
the
farm
heathcliff
bore
his
degradation
pretty
well
at
first
because
cathy
taught
him
what
she
learnt
and
worked
or
played
with
him
in
the
fields
they
both
promised
fair
to
grow
up
as
rude
as
savages
the
young
master
being
entirely
negligent
how
they
behaved
and
what
they
did
so
they
kept
clear
of
him
he
would
not
even
have
seen
after
their
going
to
church
on
sundays
only
joseph
and
the
curate
reprimanded
his
carelessness
when
they
absented
themselves
and
that
reminded
him
to
order
heathcliff
a
flogging
and
catherine
a
fast
from
dinner
or
supper
but
it
was
one
of
their
chief
amusements
to
run
away
to
the
moors
in
the
morning
and
remain
there
all
day
and
the
after
punishment
grew
a
mere
thing
to
laugh
at
the
curate
might
set
as
many
chapters
as
he
pleased
for
catherine
to
get
by
heart
and
joseph
might
thrash
heathcliff
till
his
arm
ached
they
forgot
everything
the
minute
they
were
together
again
at
least
the
minute
they
had
contrived
some
naughty
plan
of
revenge
and
many
a
time
i
cried
to
myself
to
watch
them
growing
more
reckless
daily
and
i
not
daring
to
speak
a
syllable
for
fear
of
losing
the
small
power
i
still
retained
over
the
unfriended
creatures
one
sunday
evening
it
chanced
that
they
were
banished
from
the
for
making
a
noise
or
a
light
offence
of
the
kind
and
when
i
went
to
call
them
to
supper
i
could
discover
them
nowhere
we
searched
the
house
above
and
below
and
the
yard
and
stables
they
were
invisible
and
at
last
hindley
in
a
passion
told
us
to
bolt
the
doors
and
swore
nobody
should
let
them
in
that
night
the
household
went
to
bed
and
i
too
anxious
to
lie
down
opened
my
lattice
and
put
my
head
out
to
hearken
though
it
rained
determined
to
admit
them
in
spite
of
the
prohibition
should
they
return
in
a
while
i
distinguished
steps
coming
up
the
road
and
the
light
of
a
lantern
glimmered
through
the
gate
i
threw
a
shawl
over
my
head
and
ran
to
prevent
them
from
waking
earnshaw
by
knocking
there
was
heathcliff
by
himself
it
gave
me
a
start
to
see
him
alone
is
miss
catherine
i
cried
hurriedly
accident
i
hope
thrushcross
grange
he
answered
i
would
have
been
there
too
but
they
had
not
the
manners
to
ask
me
to
stay
you
will
catch
it
i
said
never
be
content
till
you
sent
about
your
business
what
in
the
world
led
you
wandering
to
thrushcross
grange
me
get
off
my
wet
clothes
and
i
tell
you
all
about
it
nelly
he
replied
i
bid
him
beware
of
rousing
the
master
and
while
he
undressed
and
i
waited
to
put
out
the
candle
he
continued
and
i
escaped
from
the
to
have
a
ramble
at
liberty
and
getting
a
glimpse
of
the
grange
lights
we
thought
we
would
just
go
and
see
whether
the
lintons
passed
their
sunday
evenings
standing
shivering
in
corners
while
their
father
and
mother
sat
eating
and
drinking
and
singing
and
laughing
and
burning
their
eyes
out
before
the
fire
do
you
think
they
do
or
reading
sermons
and
being
catechised
by
their
manservant
and
set
to
learn
a
column
of
scripture
names
if
they
do
answer
properly
not
i
responded
are
good
children
no
doubt
and
do
deserve
the
treatment
you
receive
for
your
bad
conduct
cant
nelly
he
said
we
ran
from
the
top
of
the
heights
to
the
park
without
stopping
catherine
completely
beaten
in
the
race
because
she
was
barefoot
you
have
to
seek
for
her
shoes
in
the
bog
we
crept
through
a
broken
hedge
groped
our
way
up
the
path
and
planted
ourselves
on
a
under
the
window
the
light
came
from
thence
they
had
not
put
up
the
shutters
and
the
curtains
were
only
half
closed
both
of
us
were
able
to
look
in
by
standing
on
the
basement
and
clinging
to
the
ledge
and
we
saw
ah
it
was
beautiful
a
splendid
place
carpeted
with
crimson
and
chairs
and
tables
and
a
pure
white
ceiling
bordered
by
gold
a
shower
of
hanging
in
silver
chains
from
the
centre
and
shimmering
with
little
soft
tapers
old
and
linton
were
not
there
edgar
and
his
sisters
had
it
entirely
to
themselves
should
they
have
been
happy
we
should
have
thought
ourselves
in
heaven
and
now
guess
what
your
good
children
were
doing
isabella
i
believe
she
is
eleven
a
year
younger
than
cathy
lay
screaming
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
shrieking
as
if
witches
were
running
needles
into
her
edgar
stood
on
the
hearth
weeping
silently
and
in
the
middle
of
the
table
sat
a
little
dog
shaking
its
paw
and
yelping
which
from
their
mutual
accusations
we
understood
they
had
nearly
pulled
in
two
between
them
the
idiots
that
was
their
pleasure
to
quarrel
who
should
hold
a
heap
of
warm
hair
and
each
begin
to
cry
because
both
after
struggling
to
get
it
refused
to
take
it
we
laughed
outright
at
the
petted
things
we
did
despise
them
when
would
you
catch
me
wishing
to
have
what
catherine
wanted
or
find
us
by
ourselves
seeking
entertainment
in
yelling
and
sobbing
and
rolling
on
the
ground
divided
by
the
whole
room
i
not
exchange
for
a
thousand
lives
my
condition
here
for
edgar
linton
at
thrushcross
grange
not
if
i
might
have
the
privilege
of
flinging
joseph
off
the
highest
gable
and
painting
the
with
blood
hush
i
interrupted
you
have
not
told
me
heathcliff
how
catherine
is
left
behind
told
you
we
laughed
he
answered
lintons
heard
us
and
with
one
accord
they
shot
like
arrows
to
the
door
there
was
silence
and
then
a
cry
oh
mamma
mamma
oh
papa
oh
mamma
come
here
oh
papa
oh
they
really
did
howl
out
something
in
that
way
we
made
frightful
noises
to
terrify
them
still
more
and
then
we
dropped
off
the
ledge
because
somebody
was
drawing
the
bars
and
we
felt
we
had
better
flee
i
had
cathy
by
the
hand
and
was
urging
her
on
when
all
at
once
she
fell
down
run
heathcliff
run
she
whispered
they
have
let
the
loose
and
he
holds
me
the
devil
had
seized
her
ankle
nelly
i
heard
his
abominable
snorting
she
did
not
yell
out
no
she
would
have
scorned
to
do
it
if
she
had
been
spitted
on
the
horns
of
a
mad
cow
i
did
though
i
vociferated
curses
enough
to
annihilate
any
fiend
in
christendom
and
i
got
a
stone
and
thrust
it
between
his
jaws
and
tried
with
all
my
might
to
cram
it
down
his
throat
a
beast
of
a
servant
came
up
with
a
lantern
at
last
shouting
keep
fast
skulker
keep
fast
he
changed
his
note
however
when
he
saw
skulker
game
the
dog
was
throttled
off
his
huge
purple
tongue
hanging
half
a
foot
out
of
his
mouth
and
his
pendent
lips
streaming
with
bloody
slaver
the
man
took
cathy
up
she
was
sick
not
from
fear
i
certain
but
from
pain
he
carried
her
in
i
followed
grumbling
execrations
and
vengeance
what
prey
robert
hallooed
linton
from
the
entrance
skulker
has
caught
a
little
girl
sir
he
replied
and
there
a
lad
here
he
added
making
a
clutch
at
me
who
looks
an
very
like
the
robbers
were
for
putting
them
through
the
window
to
open
the
doors
to
the
gang
after
all
were
asleep
that
they
might
murder
us
at
their
ease
hold
your
tongue
you
thief
you
you
shall
go
to
the
gallows
for
this
linton
sir
do
lay
by
your
gun
no
no
robert
said
the
old
fool
the
rascals
knew
that
yesterday
was
my
they
thought
to
have
me
cleverly
come
in
i
furnish
them
a
reception
there
john
fasten
the
chain
give
skulker
some
water
jenny
to
beard
a
magistrate
in
his
stronghold
and
on
the
sabbath
too
where
will
their
insolence
stop
oh
my
dear
mary
look
here
do
be
afraid
it
is
but
a
boy
yet
the
villain
scowls
so
plainly
in
his
face
would
it
not
be
a
kindness
to
the
country
to
hang
him
at
once
before
he
shows
his
nature
in
acts
as
well
as
features
he
pulled
me
under
the
chandelier
and
linton
placed
her
spectacles
on
her
nose
and
raised
her
hands
in
horror
the
cowardly
children
crept
nearer
also
isabella
lisping
frightful
thing
put
him
in
the
cellar
papa
he
exactly
like
the
son
of
the
that
stole
my
tame
pheasant
he
edgar
they
examined
me
cathy
came
round
she
heard
the
last
speech
and
laughed
edgar
linton
after
an
inquisitive
stare
collected
sufficient
wit
to
recognise
her
they
see
us
at
church
you
know
though
we
seldom
meet
them
elsewhere
that
miss
earnshaw
he
whispered
to
his
mother
and
look
how
skulker
has
bitten
her
how
her
foot
bleeds
miss
earnshaw
nonsense
cried
the
dame
miss
earnshaw
scouring
the
country
with
a
gipsy
and
yet
my
dear
the
child
is
in
mourning
surely
it
is
and
she
may
be
lamed
for
life
what
culpable
carelessness
in
her
brother
exclaimed
linton
turning
from
me
to
catherine
i
understood
from
shielders
that
was
the
curate
sir
that
he
lets
her
grow
up
in
absolute
heathenism
but
who
is
this
where
did
she
pick
up
this
companion
oho
i
declare
he
is
that
strange
acquisition
my
late
neighbour
made
in
his
journey
to
liverpool
a
little
lascar
or
an
american
or
spanish
castaway
a
wicked
boy
at
all
events
remarked
the
old
lady
and
quite
unfit
for
a
decent
house
did
you
notice
his
language
linton
i
shocked
that
my
children
should
have
heard
it
recommenced
cursing
do
be
angry
nelly
and
so
robert
was
ordered
to
take
me
off
i
refused
to
go
without
cathy
he
dragged
me
into
the
garden
pushed
the
lantern
into
my
hand
assured
me
that
earnshaw
should
be
informed
of
my
behaviour
and
bidding
me
march
directly
secured
the
door
again
the
curtains
were
still
looped
up
at
one
corner
and
i
resumed
my
station
as
spy
because
if
catherine
had
wished
to
return
i
intended
shattering
their
great
glass
panes
to
a
million
of
fragments
unless
they
let
her
out
she
sat
on
the
sofa
quietly
linton
took
off
the
grey
cloak
of
the
which
we
had
borrowed
for
our
excursion
shaking
her
head
and
expostulating
with
her
i
suppose
she
was
a
young
lady
and
they
made
a
distinction
between
her
treatment
and
mine
then
the
brought
a
basin
of
warm
water
and
washed
her
feet
and
linton
mixed
a
tumbler
of
negus
and
isabella
emptied
a
plateful
of
cakes
into
her
lap
and
edgar
stood
gaping
at
a
distance
afterwards
they
dried
and
combed
her
beautiful
hair
and
gave
her
a
pair
of
enormous
slippers
and
wheeled
her
to
the
fire
and
i
left
her
as
merry
as
she
could
be
dividing
her
food
between
the
little
dog
and
skulker
whose
nose
she
pinched
as
he
ate
and
kindling
a
spark
of
spirit
in
the
vacant
blue
eyes
of
the
lintons
a
dim
reflection
from
her
own
enchanting
face
i
saw
they
were
full
of
stupid
admiration
she
is
so
immeasurably
superior
to
them
to
everybody
on
earth
is
she
not
nelly
will
more
come
of
this
business
than
you
reckon
on
i
answered
covering
him
up
and
extinguishing
the
light
are
incurable
heathcliff
and
hindley
will
have
to
proceed
to
extremities
see
if
he
wo
my
words
came
truer
than
i
desired
the
luckless
adventure
made
earnshaw
furious
and
then
linton
to
mend
matters
paid
us
a
visit
himself
on
the
morrow
and
read
the
young
master
such
a
lecture
on
the
road
he
guided
his
family
that
he
was
stirred
to
look
about
him
in
earnest
heathcliff
received
no
flogging
but
he
was
told
that
the
first
word
he
spoke
to
miss
catherine
should
ensure
a
dismissal
and
earnshaw
undertook
to
keep
her
in
due
restraint
when
she
returned
home
employing
art
not
force
with
force
she
would
have
found
it
impossible
chapter
vii
cathy
stayed
at
thrushcross
grange
five
weeks
till
christmas
by
that
time
her
ankle
was
thoroughly
cured
and
her
manners
much
improved
the
mistress
visited
her
often
in
the
interval
and
commenced
her
plan
of
reform
by
trying
to
raise
her
with
fine
clothes
and
flattery
which
she
took
readily
so
that
instead
of
a
wild
hatless
little
savage
jumping
into
the
house
and
rushing
to
squeeze
us
all
breathless
there
from
a
handsome
black
pony
a
very
dignified
person
with
brown
ringlets
falling
from
the
cover
of
a
feathered
beaver
and
a
long
cloth
habit
which
she
was
obliged
to
hold
up
with
both
hands
that
she
might
sail
in
hindley
lifted
her
from
her
horse
exclaiming
delightedly
cathy
you
are
quite
a
beauty
i
should
scarcely
have
known
you
you
look
like
a
lady
now
isabella
linton
is
not
to
be
compared
with
her
is
she
frances
has
not
her
natural
advantages
replied
his
wife
she
must
mind
and
not
grow
wild
again
here
ellen
help
miss
catherine
off
with
her
things
stay
dear
you
will
disarrange
your
curls
let
me
untie
your
hat
i
removed
the
habit
and
there
shone
forth
beneath
a
grand
plaid
silk
frock
white
trousers
and
burnished
shoes
and
while
her
eyes
sparkled
joyfully
when
the
dogs
came
bounding
up
to
welcome
her
she
dared
hardly
touch
them
lest
they
should
fawn
upon
her
splendid
garments
she
kissed
me
gently
i
was
all
flour
making
the
christmas
cake
and
it
would
not
have
done
to
give
me
a
hug
and
then
she
looked
round
for
heathcliff
and
earnshaw
watched
anxiously
their
meeting
thinking
it
would
enable
them
to
judge
in
some
measure
what
grounds
they
had
for
hoping
to
succeed
in
separating
the
two
friends
heathcliff
was
hard
to
discover
at
first
if
he
were
careless
and
uncared
for
before
catherine
absence
he
had
been
ten
times
more
so
since
nobody
but
i
even
did
him
the
kindness
to
call
him
a
dirty
boy
and
bid
him
wash
himself
once
a
week
and
children
of
his
age
seldom
have
a
natural
pleasure
in
soap
and
water
therefore
not
to
mention
his
clothes
which
had
seen
three
months
service
in
mire
and
dust
and
his
thick
uncombed
hair
the
surface
of
his
face
and
hands
was
dismally
beclouded
he
might
well
skulk
behind
the
settle
on
beholding
such
a
bright
graceful
damsel
enter
the
house
instead
of
a
counterpart
of
himself
as
he
expected
heathcliff
not
here
she
demanded
pulling
off
her
gloves
and
displaying
fingers
wonderfully
whitened
with
doing
nothing
and
staying
indoors
you
may
come
forward
cried
hindley
enjoying
his
discomfiture
and
gratified
to
see
what
a
forbidding
young
blackguard
he
would
be
compelled
to
present
himself
may
come
and
wish
miss
catherine
welcome
like
the
other
servants
cathy
catching
a
glimpse
of
her
friend
in
his
concealment
flew
to
embrace
him
she
bestowed
seven
or
eight
kisses
on
his
cheek
within
the
second
and
then
stopped
and
drawing
back
burst
into
a
laugh
exclaiming
how
very
black
and
cross
you
look
and
how
how
funny
and
grim
but
that
because
i
used
to
edgar
and
isabella
linton
well
heathcliff
have
you
forgotten
me
she
had
some
reason
to
put
the
question
for
shame
and
pride
threw
double
gloom
over
his
countenance
and
kept
him
immovable
hands
heathcliff
said
earnshaw
condescendingly
in
a
way
that
is
permitted
shall
not
replied
the
boy
finding
his
tongue
at
last
shall
not
stand
to
be
laughed
at
i
shall
not
bear
it
and
he
would
have
broken
from
the
circle
but
miss
cathy
seized
him
again
did
not
mean
to
laugh
at
you
she
said
could
not
hinder
myself
heathcliff
shake
hands
at
least
what
are
you
sulky
for
it
was
only
that
you
looked
odd
if
you
wash
your
face
and
brush
your
hair
it
will
be
all
right
but
you
are
so
dirty
she
gazed
concernedly
at
the
dusky
fingers
she
held
in
her
own
and
also
at
her
dress
which
she
feared
had
gained
no
embellishment
from
its
contact
with
his
need
have
touched
me
he
answered
following
her
eye
and
snatching
away
his
hand
shall
be
as
dirty
as
i
please
and
i
like
to
be
dirty
and
i
will
be
dirty
with
that
he
dashed
headforemost
out
of
the
room
amid
the
merriment
of
the
master
and
mistress
and
to
the
serious
disturbance
of
catherine
who
could
not
comprehend
how
her
remarks
should
have
produced
such
an
exhibition
of
bad
temper
after
playing
to
the
and
putting
my
cakes
in
the
oven
and
making
the
house
and
kitchen
cheerful
with
great
fires
befitting
i
prepared
to
sit
down
and
amuse
myself
by
singing
carols
all
alone
regardless
of
joseph
affirmations
that
he
considered
the
merry
tunes
i
chose
as
next
door
to
songs
he
had
retired
to
private
prayer
in
his
chamber
and
and
earnshaw
were
engaging
missy
attention
by
sundry
gay
trifles
bought
for
her
to
present
to
the
little
lintons
as
an
acknowledgment
of
their
kindness
they
had
invited
them
to
spend
the
morrow
at
wuthering
heights
and
the
invitation
had
been
accepted
on
one
condition
linton
begged
that
her
darlings
might
be
kept
carefully
apart
from
that
swearing
boy
under
these
circumstances
i
remained
solitary
i
smelt
the
rich
scent
of
the
heating
spices
and
admired
the
shining
kitchen
utensils
the
polished
clock
decked
in
holly
the
silver
mugs
ranged
on
a
tray
ready
to
be
filled
with
mulled
ale
for
supper
and
above
all
the
speckless
purity
of
my
particular
care
the
scoured
and
floor
i
gave
due
inward
applause
to
every
object
and
then
i
remembered
how
old
earnshaw
used
to
come
in
when
all
was
tidied
and
call
me
a
cant
lass
and
slip
a
shilling
into
my
hand
as
a
and
from
that
i
went
on
to
think
of
his
fondness
for
heathcliff
and
his
dread
lest
he
should
suffer
neglect
after
death
had
removed
him
and
that
naturally
led
me
to
consider
the
poor
lad
situation
now
and
from
singing
i
changed
my
mind
to
crying
it
struck
me
soon
however
there
would
be
more
sense
in
endeavouring
to
repair
some
of
his
wrongs
than
shedding
tears
over
them
i
got
up
and
walked
into
the
court
to
seek
him
he
was
not
far
i
found
him
smoothing
the
glossy
coat
of
the
new
pony
in
the
stable
and
feeding
the
other
beasts
according
to
custom
haste
heathcliff
i
said
kitchen
is
so
comfortable
and
joseph
is
make
haste
and
let
me
dress
you
smart
before
miss
cathy
comes
out
and
then
you
can
sit
together
with
the
whole
hearth
to
yourselves
and
have
a
long
chatter
till
bedtime
he
proceeded
with
his
task
and
never
turned
his
head
towards
me
are
you
coming
i
continued
a
little
cake
for
each
of
you
nearly
enough
and
you
need
donning
i
waited
five
minutes
but
getting
no
answer
left
him
catherine
supped
with
her
brother
and
joseph
and
i
joined
at
an
unsociable
meal
seasoned
with
reproofs
on
one
side
and
sauciness
on
the
other
his
cake
and
cheese
remained
on
the
table
all
night
for
the
fairies
he
managed
to
continue
work
till
nine
and
then
marched
dumb
and
dour
to
his
chamber
cathy
sat
up
late
having
a
world
of
things
to
order
for
the
reception
of
her
new
friends
she
came
into
the
kitchen
once
to
speak
to
her
old
one
but
he
was
gone
and
she
only
stayed
to
ask
what
was
the
matter
with
him
and
then
went
back
in
the
morning
he
rose
early
and
as
it
was
a
holiday
carried
his
on
to
the
moors
not
till
the
family
were
departed
for
church
fasting
and
reflection
seemed
to
have
brought
him
to
a
better
spirit
he
hung
about
me
for
a
while
and
having
screwed
up
his
courage
exclaimed
abruptly
make
me
decent
i
going
to
be
good
time
heathcliff
i
said
grieved
catherine
sorry
she
ever
came
home
i
daresay
it
looks
as
if
you
envied
her
because
she
is
more
thought
of
than
you
the
notion
of
catherine
was
incomprehensible
to
him
but
the
notion
of
grieving
her
he
understood
clearly
enough
she
say
she
was
grieved
he
inquired
looking
very
serious
cried
when
i
told
her
you
were
off
again
this
morning
cried
last
night
he
returned
i
had
more
reason
to
cry
than
she
you
had
the
reason
of
going
to
bed
with
a
proud
heart
and
an
empty
stomach
said
i
people
breed
sad
sorrows
for
themselves
but
if
you
be
ashamed
of
your
touchiness
you
must
ask
pardon
mind
when
she
comes
in
you
must
go
up
and
offer
to
kiss
her
and
say
you
know
best
what
to
say
only
do
it
heartily
and
not
as
if
you
thought
her
converted
into
a
stranger
by
her
grand
dress
and
now
though
i
have
dinner
to
get
ready
i
steal
time
to
arrange
you
so
that
edgar
linton
shall
look
quite
a
doll
beside
you
and
that
he
does
you
are
younger
and
yet
i
be
bound
you
are
taller
and
twice
as
broad
across
the
shoulders
you
could
knock
him
down
in
a
twinkling
do
you
feel
that
you
could
heathcliff
face
brightened
a
moment
then
it
was
overcast
afresh
and
he
sighed
nelly
if
i
knocked
him
down
twenty
times
that
would
make
him
less
handsome
or
me
more
so
i
wish
i
had
light
hair
and
a
fair
skin
and
was
dressed
and
behaved
as
well
and
had
a
chance
of
being
as
rich
as
he
will
be
cried
for
mamma
at
every
turn
i
added
trembled
if
a
country
lad
heaved
his
fist
against
you
and
sat
at
home
all
day
for
a
shower
of
rain
oh
heathcliff
you
are
showing
a
poor
spirit
come
to
the
glass
and
i
let
you
see
what
you
should
wish
do
you
mark
those
two
lines
between
your
eyes
and
those
thick
brows
that
instead
of
rising
arched
sink
in
the
middle
and
that
couple
of
black
fiends
so
deeply
buried
who
never
open
their
windows
boldly
but
lurk
glinting
under
them
like
devil
spies
wish
and
learn
to
smooth
away
the
surly
wrinkles
to
raise
your
lids
frankly
and
change
the
fiends
to
confident
innocent
angels
suspecting
and
doubting
nothing
and
always
seeing
friends
where
they
are
not
sure
of
foes
do
get
the
expression
of
a
vicious
cur
that
appears
to
know
the
kicks
it
gets
are
its
dessert
and
yet
hates
all
the
world
as
well
as
the
kicker
for
what
it
suffers
other
words
i
must
wish
for
edgar
linton
great
blue
eyes
and
even
forehead
he
replied
do
and
that
wo
help
me
to
them
good
heart
will
help
you
to
a
bonny
face
my
lad
i
continued
you
were
a
regular
black
and
a
bad
one
will
turn
the
bonniest
into
something
worse
than
ugly
and
now
that
we
done
washing
and
combing
and
sulking
tell
me
whether
you
do
think
yourself
rather
handsome
i
tell
you
i
do
you
fit
for
a
prince
in
disguise
who
knows
but
your
father
was
emperor
of
china
and
your
mother
an
indian
queen
each
of
them
able
to
buy
up
with
one
week
income
wuthering
heights
and
thrushcross
grange
together
and
you
were
kidnapped
by
wicked
sailors
and
brought
to
england
were
i
in
your
place
i
would
frame
high
notions
of
my
birth
and
the
thoughts
of
what
i
was
should
give
me
courage
and
dignity
to
support
the
oppressions
of
a
little
farmer
so
i
chattered
on
and
heathcliff
gradually
lost
his
frown
and
began
to
look
quite
pleasant
when
all
at
once
our
conversation
was
interrupted
by
a
rumbling
sound
moving
up
the
road
and
entering
the
court
he
ran
to
the
window
and
i
to
the
door
just
in
time
to
behold
the
two
lintons
descend
from
the
family
carriage
smothered
in
cloaks
and
furs
and
the
earnshaws
dismount
from
their
horses
they
often
rode
to
church
in
winter
catherine
took
a
hand
of
each
of
the
children
and
brought
them
into
the
house
and
set
them
before
the
fire
which
quickly
put
colour
into
their
white
faces
i
urged
my
companion
to
hasten
now
and
show
his
amiable
humour
and
he
willingly
obeyed
but
ill
luck
would
have
it
that
as
he
opened
the
door
leading
from
the
kitchen
on
one
side
hindley
opened
it
on
the
other
they
met
and
the
master
irritated
at
seeing
him
clean
and
cheerful
or
perhaps
eager
to
keep
his
promise
to
linton
shoved
him
back
with
a
sudden
thrust
and
angrily
bade
joseph
the
fellow
out
of
the
room
send
him
into
the
garret
till
dinner
is
over
he
be
cramming
his
fingers
in
the
tarts
and
stealing
the
fruit
if
left
alone
with
them
a
minute
sir
i
could
not
avoid
answering
touch
nothing
not
he
and
i
suppose
he
must
have
his
share
of
the
dainties
as
well
as
we
shall
have
his
share
of
my
hand
if
i
catch
him
downstairs
till
dark
cried
hindley
you
vagabond
what
you
are
attempting
the
coxcomb
are
you
wait
till
i
get
hold
of
those
elegant
locks
see
if
i
wo
pull
them
a
bit
longer
are
long
enough
already
observed
master
linton
peeping
from
the
doorway
wonder
they
do
make
his
head
ache
it
like
a
mane
over
his
eyes
he
ventured
this
remark
without
any
intention
to
insult
but
violent
nature
was
not
prepared
to
endure
the
appearance
of
impertinence
from
one
whom
he
seemed
to
hate
even
then
as
a
rival
he
seized
a
tureen
of
hot
apple
sauce
the
first
thing
that
came
under
his
grip
and
dashed
it
full
against
the
speaker
face
and
neck
who
instantly
commenced
a
lament
that
brought
isabella
and
catherine
hurrying
to
the
place
earnshaw
snatched
up
the
culprit
directly
and
conveyed
him
to
his
chamber
where
doubtless
he
administered
a
rough
remedy
to
cool
the
fit
of
passion
for
he
appeared
red
and
breathless
i
got
the
dishcloth
and
rather
spitefully
scrubbed
edgar
nose
and
mouth
affirming
it
served
him
right
for
meddling
his
sister
began
weeping
to
go
home
and
cathy
stood
by
confounded
blushing
for
all
should
not
have
spoken
to
him
she
expostulated
with
master
linton
was
in
a
bad
temper
and
now
you
spoilt
your
visit
and
he
be
flogged
i
hate
him
to
be
flogged
i
ca
eat
my
dinner
why
did
you
speak
to
him
edgar
did
sobbed
the
youth
escaping
from
my
hands
and
finishing
the
remainder
of
the
purification
with
his
cambric
promised
mamma
that
i
would
say
one
word
to
him
and
i
did
do
cry
replied
catherine
contemptuously
not
killed
do
make
more
mischief
my
brother
is
coming
be
quiet
hush
isabella
has
anybody
hurt
you
there
children
to
your
seats
cried
hindley
bustling
in
brute
of
a
lad
has
warmed
me
nicely
next
time
master
edgar
take
the
law
into
your
own
fists
it
will
give
you
an
appetite
the
little
party
recovered
its
equanimity
at
sight
of
the
fragrant
feast
they
were
hungry
after
their
ride
and
easily
consoled
since
no
real
harm
had
befallen
them
earnshaw
carved
bountiful
platefuls
and
the
mistress
made
them
merry
with
lively
talk
i
waited
behind
her
chair
and
was
pained
to
behold
catherine
with
dry
eyes
and
an
indifferent
air
commence
cutting
up
the
wing
of
a
goose
before
her
unfeeling
child
i
thought
to
myself
lightly
she
dismisses
her
old
playmate
troubles
i
could
not
have
imagined
her
to
be
so
selfish
she
lifted
a
mouthful
to
her
lips
then
she
set
it
down
again
her
cheeks
flushed
and
the
tears
gushed
over
them
she
slipped
her
fork
to
the
floor
and
hastily
dived
under
the
cloth
to
conceal
her
emotion
i
did
not
call
her
unfeeling
long
for
i
perceived
she
was
in
purgatory
throughout
the
day
and
wearying
to
find
an
opportunity
of
getting
by
herself
or
paying
a
visit
to
heathcliff
who
had
been
locked
up
by
the
master
as
i
discovered
on
endeavouring
to
introduce
to
him
a
private
mess
of
victuals
in
the
evening
we
had
a
dance
cathy
begged
that
he
might
be
liberated
then
as
isabella
linton
had
no
partner
her
entreaties
were
vain
and
i
was
appointed
to
supply
the
deficiency
we
got
rid
of
all
gloom
in
the
excitement
of
the
exercise
and
our
pleasure
was
increased
by
the
arrival
of
the
gimmerton
band
mustering
fifteen
strong
a
trumpet
a
trombone
clarionets
bassoons
french
horns
and
a
bass
viol
besides
singers
they
go
the
rounds
of
all
the
respectable
houses
and
receive
contributions
every
christmas
and
we
esteemed
it
a
treat
to
hear
them
after
the
usual
carols
had
been
sung
we
set
them
to
songs
and
glees
earnshaw
loved
the
music
and
so
they
gave
us
plenty
catherine
loved
it
too
but
she
said
it
sounded
sweetest
at
the
top
of
the
steps
and
she
went
up
in
the
dark
i
followed
they
shut
the
house
door
below
never
noting
our
absence
it
was
so
full
of
people
she
made
no
stay
at
the
but
mounted
farther
to
the
garret
where
heathcliff
was
confined
and
called
him
he
stubbornly
declined
answering
for
a
while
she
persevered
and
finally
persuaded
him
to
hold
communion
with
her
through
the
boards
i
let
the
poor
things
converse
unmolested
till
i
supposed
the
songs
were
going
to
cease
and
the
singers
to
get
some
refreshment
then
i
clambered
up
the
ladder
to
warn
her
instead
of
finding
her
outside
i
heard
her
voice
within
the
little
monkey
had
crept
by
the
skylight
of
one
garret
along
the
roof
into
the
skylight
of
the
other
and
it
was
with
the
utmost
difficulty
i
could
coax
her
out
again
when
she
did
come
heathcliff
came
with
her
and
she
insisted
that
i
should
take
him
into
the
kitchen
as
my
had
gone
to
a
neighbour
to
be
removed
from
the
sound
of
our
psalmody
as
it
pleased
him
to
call
it
i
told
them
i
intended
by
no
means
to
encourage
their
tricks
but
as
the
prisoner
had
never
broken
his
fast
since
yesterday
dinner
i
would
wink
at
his
cheating
hindley
that
once
he
went
down
i
set
him
a
stool
by
the
fire
and
offered
him
a
quantity
of
good
things
but
he
was
sick
and
could
eat
little
and
my
attempts
to
entertain
him
were
thrown
away
he
leant
his
two
elbows
on
his
knees
and
his
chin
on
his
hands
and
remained
rapt
in
dumb
meditation
on
my
inquiring
the
subject
of
his
thoughts
he
answered
gravely
trying
to
settle
how
i
shall
pay
hindley
back
i
do
care
how
long
i
wait
if
i
can
only
do
it
at
last
i
hope
he
will
not
die
before
i
do
shame
heathcliff
said
i
is
for
god
to
punish
wicked
people
we
should
learn
to
forgive
god
wo
have
the
satisfaction
that
i
shall
he
returned
only
wish
i
knew
the
best
way
let
me
alone
and
i
plan
it
out
while
thinking
of
that
i
do
feel
pain
lockwood
i
forget
these
tales
can
not
divert
you
i
annoyed
how
i
should
dream
of
chattering
on
at
such
a
rate
and
your
gruel
cold
and
you
nodding
for
bed
i
could
have
told
heathcliff
history
all
that
you
need
hear
in
half
a
dozen
words
thus
interrupting
herself
the
housekeeper
rose
and
proceeded
to
lay
aside
her
sewing
but
i
felt
incapable
of
moving
from
the
hearth
and
i
was
very
far
from
nodding
still
dean
i
cried
sit
still
another
you
done
just
right
to
tell
the
story
leisurely
that
is
the
method
i
like
and
you
must
finish
it
in
the
same
style
i
am
interested
in
every
character
you
have
mentioned
more
or
less
clock
is
on
the
stroke
of
eleven
sir
matter
i
not
accustomed
to
go
to
bed
in
the
long
hours
one
or
two
is
early
enough
for
a
person
who
lies
till
ten
should
lie
till
ten
there
the
very
prime
of
the
morning
gone
long
before
that
time
a
person
who
has
not
done
his
day
work
by
ten
runs
a
chance
of
leaving
the
other
half
undone
dean
resume
your
chair
because
i
intend
lengthening
the
night
till
afternoon
i
prognosticate
for
myself
an
obstinate
cold
at
least
hope
not
sir
well
you
must
allow
me
to
leap
over
some
three
years
during
that
space
earnshaw
no
i
allow
nothing
of
the
sort
are
you
acquainted
with
the
mood
of
mind
in
which
if
you
were
seated
alone
and
the
cat
licking
its
kitten
on
the
rug
before
you
you
would
watch
the
operation
so
intently
that
puss
neglect
of
one
ear
would
put
you
seriously
out
of
temper
terribly
lazy
mood
i
should
say
the
contrary
a
tiresomely
active
one
it
is
mine
at
present
and
therefore
continue
minutely
i
perceive
that
people
in
these
regions
acquire
over
people
in
towns
the
value
that
a
spider
in
a
dungeon
does
over
a
spider
in
a
cottage
to
their
various
occupants
and
yet
the
deepened
attraction
is
not
entirely
owing
to
the
situation
of
the
they
live
more
in
earnest
more
in
themselves
and
less
in
surface
change
and
frivolous
external
things
i
could
fancy
a
love
for
life
here
almost
possible
and
i
was
a
fixed
unbeliever
in
any
love
of
a
year
standing
one
state
resembles
setting
a
hungry
man
down
to
a
single
dish
on
which
he
may
concentrate
his
entire
appetite
and
do
it
justice
the
other
introducing
him
to
a
table
laid
out
by
french
cooks
he
can
perhaps
extract
as
much
enjoyment
from
the
whole
but
each
part
is
a
mere
atom
in
his
regard
and
remembrance
here
we
are
the
same
as
anywhere
else
when
you
get
to
know
us
observed
dean
somewhat
puzzled
at
my
speech
me
i
responded
my
good
friend
are
a
striking
evidence
against
that
assertion
excepting
a
few
provincialisms
of
slight
consequence
you
have
no
marks
of
the
manners
which
i
am
habituated
to
consider
as
peculiar
to
your
class
i
am
sure
you
have
thought
a
great
deal
more
than
the
generality
of
servants
think
you
have
been
compelled
to
cultivate
your
reflective
faculties
for
want
of
occasions
for
frittering
your
life
away
in
silly
trifles
dean
laughed
certainly
esteem
myself
a
steady
reasonable
kind
of
body
she
said
exactly
from
living
among
the
hills
and
seeing
one
set
of
faces
and
one
series
of
actions
from
year
end
to
year
end
but
i
have
undergone
sharp
discipline
which
has
taught
me
wisdom
and
then
i
have
read
more
than
you
would
fancy
lockwood
you
could
not
open
a
book
in
this
library
that
i
have
not
looked
into
and
got
something
out
of
also
unless
it
be
that
range
of
greek
and
latin
and
that
of
french
and
those
i
know
one
from
another
it
is
as
much
as
you
can
expect
of
a
poor
man
daughter
however
if
i
am
to
follow
my
story
in
true
fashion
i
had
better
go
on
and
instead
of
leaping
three
years
i
will
be
content
to
pass
to
the
next
summer
the
summer
of
that
is
nearly
years
ago
chapter
viii
on
the
morning
of
a
fine
june
day
my
first
bonny
little
nursling
and
the
last
of
the
ancient
earnshaw
stock
was
born
we
were
busy
with
the
hay
in
a
field
when
the
girl
that
usually
brought
our
breakfasts
came
running
an
hour
too
soon
across
the
meadow
and
up
the
lane
calling
me
as
she
ran
such
a
grand
bairn
she
panted
out
finest
lad
that
ever
breathed
but
the
doctor
says
missis
must
go
he
says
she
been
in
a
consumption
these
many
months
i
heard
him
tell
hindley
and
now
she
has
nothing
to
keep
her
and
she
be
dead
before
winter
you
must
come
home
directly
you
to
nurse
it
nelly
to
feed
it
with
sugar
and
milk
and
take
care
of
it
day
and
night
i
wish
i
were
you
because
it
will
be
all
yours
when
there
is
no
missis
is
she
very
ill
i
asked
flinging
down
my
rake
and
tying
my
bonnet
guess
she
is
yet
she
looks
bravely
replied
the
girl
she
talks
as
if
she
thought
of
living
to
see
it
grow
a
man
she
out
of
her
head
for
joy
it
such
a
beauty
if
i
were
her
i
certain
i
should
not
die
i
should
get
better
at
the
bare
sight
of
it
in
spite
of
kenneth
i
was
fairly
mad
at
him
dame
archer
brought
the
cherub
down
to
master
in
the
house
and
his
face
just
began
to
light
up
when
the
old
croaker
steps
forward
and
says
he
earnshaw
it
a
blessing
your
wife
has
been
spared
to
leave
you
this
son
when
she
came
i
felt
convinced
we
should
keep
her
long
and
now
i
must
tell
you
the
winter
will
probably
finish
her
do
take
on
and
fret
about
it
too
much
it
be
helped
and
besides
you
should
have
known
better
than
to
choose
such
a
rush
of
a
lass
what
did
the
master
answer
i
inquired
think
he
swore
but
i
did
mind
him
i
was
straining
to
see
the
bairn
and
she
began
again
to
describe
it
rapturously
i
as
zealous
as
herself
hurried
eagerly
home
to
admire
on
my
part
though
i
was
very
sad
for
hindley
sake
he
had
room
in
his
heart
only
for
two
idols
his
wife
and
himself
he
doted
on
both
and
adored
one
and
i
conceive
how
he
would
bear
the
loss
when
we
got
to
wuthering
heights
there
he
stood
at
the
front
door
and
as
i
passed
in
i
asked
was
the
baby
ready
to
run
about
nell
he
replied
putting
on
a
cheerful
smile
the
mistress
i
ventured
to
inquire
doctor
says
she
the
doctor
he
interrupted
reddening
is
quite
right
she
be
perfectly
well
by
this
time
next
week
are
you
going
will
you
tell
her
that
i
come
if
she
promise
not
to
talk
i
left
her
because
she
would
not
hold
her
tongue
and
she
must
tell
her
kenneth
says
she
must
be
quiet
i
delivered
this
message
to
earnshaw
she
seemed
in
flighty
spirits
and
replied
merrily
hardly
spoke
a
word
ellen
and
there
he
has
gone
out
twice
crying
well
say
i
promise
i
wo
speak
but
that
does
not
bind
me
not
to
laugh
at
him
poor
soul
till
within
a
week
of
her
death
that
gay
heart
never
failed
her
and
her
husband
persisted
doggedly
nay
furiously
in
affirming
her
health
improved
every
day
when
kenneth
warned
him
that
his
medicines
were
useless
at
that
stage
of
the
malady
and
he
need
put
him
to
further
expense
by
attending
her
he
retorted
know
you
need
not
well
she
does
not
want
any
more
attendance
from
you
she
never
was
in
a
consumption
it
was
a
fever
and
it
is
gone
her
pulse
is
as
slow
as
mine
now
and
her
cheek
as
cool
he
told
his
wife
the
same
story
and
she
seemed
to
believe
him
but
one
night
while
leaning
on
his
shoulder
in
the
act
of
saying
she
thought
she
should
be
able
to
get
up
a
fit
of
coughing
took
her
a
very
slight
one
he
raised
her
in
his
arms
she
put
her
two
hands
about
his
neck
her
face
changed
and
she
was
dead
as
the
girl
had
anticipated
the
child
hareton
fell
wholly
into
my
hands
earnshaw
provided
he
saw
him
healthy
and
never
heard
him
cry
was
contented
as
far
as
regarded
him
for
himself
he
grew
desperate
his
sorrow
was
of
that
kind
that
will
not
lament
he
neither
wept
nor
prayed
he
cursed
and
defied
execrated
god
and
man
and
gave
himself
up
to
reckless
dissipation
the
servants
could
not
bear
his
tyrannical
and
evil
conduct
long
joseph
and
i
were
the
only
two
that
would
stay
i
had
not
the
heart
to
leave
my
charge
and
besides
you
know
i
had
been
his
and
excused
his
behaviour
more
readily
than
a
stranger
would
joseph
remained
to
hector
over
tenants
and
labourers
and
because
it
was
his
vocation
to
be
where
he
had
plenty
of
wickedness
to
reprove
the
master
bad
ways
and
bad
companions
formed
a
pretty
example
for
catherine
and
heathcliff
his
treatment
of
the
latter
was
enough
to
make
a
fiend
of
a
saint
and
truly
it
appeared
as
if
the
lad
possessed
of
something
diabolical
at
that
period
he
delighted
to
witness
hindley
degrading
himself
past
redemption
and
became
daily
more
notable
for
savage
sullenness
and
ferocity
i
could
not
half
tell
what
an
infernal
house
we
had
the
curate
dropped
calling
and
nobody
decent
came
near
us
at
last
unless
edgar
linton
visits
to
miss
cathy
might
be
an
exception
at
fifteen
she
was
the
queen
of
the
she
had
no
peer
and
she
did
turn
out
a
haughty
headstrong
creature
i
own
i
did
not
like
her
after
infancy
was
past
and
i
vexed
her
frequently
by
trying
to
bring
down
her
arrogance
she
never
took
an
aversion
to
me
though
she
had
a
wondrous
constancy
to
old
attachments
even
heathcliff
kept
his
hold
on
her
affections
unalterably
and
young
linton
with
all
his
superiority
found
it
difficult
to
make
an
equally
deep
impression
he
was
my
late
master
that
is
his
portrait
over
the
fireplace
it
used
to
hang
on
one
side
and
his
wife
on
the
other
but
hers
has
been
removed
or
else
you
might
see
something
of
what
she
was
can
you
make
that
out
dean
raised
the
candle
and
i
discerned
a
face
exceedingly
resembling
the
young
lady
at
the
heights
but
more
pensive
and
amiable
in
expression
it
formed
a
sweet
picture
the
long
light
hair
curled
slightly
on
the
temples
the
eyes
were
large
and
serious
the
figure
almost
too
graceful
i
did
not
marvel
how
catherine
earnshaw
could
forget
her
first
friend
for
such
an
individual
i
marvelled
much
how
he
with
a
mind
to
correspond
with
his
person
could
fancy
my
idea
of
catherine
earnshaw
very
agreeable
portrait
i
observed
to
the
it
like
she
answered
he
looked
better
when
he
was
animated
that
is
his
everyday
countenance
he
wanted
spirit
in
general
catherine
had
kept
up
her
acquaintance
with
the
lintons
since
her
residence
among
them
and
as
she
had
no
temptation
to
show
her
rough
side
in
their
company
and
had
the
sense
to
be
ashamed
of
being
rude
where
she
experienced
such
invariable
courtesy
she
imposed
unwittingly
on
the
old
lady
and
gentleman
by
her
ingenious
cordiality
gained
the
admiration
of
isabella
and
the
heart
and
soul
of
her
brother
acquisitions
that
flattered
her
from
the
first
for
she
was
full
of
ambition
and
led
her
to
adopt
a
double
character
without
exactly
intending
to
deceive
any
one
in
the
place
where
she
heard
heathcliff
termed
a
young
ruffian
and
than
a
brute
she
took
care
not
to
act
like
him
but
at
home
she
had
small
inclination
to
practise
politeness
that
would
only
be
laughed
at
and
restrain
an
unruly
nature
when
it
would
bring
her
neither
credit
nor
praise
edgar
seldom
mustered
courage
to
visit
wuthering
heights
openly
he
had
a
terror
of
earnshaw
reputation
and
shrunk
from
encountering
him
and
yet
he
was
always
received
with
our
best
attempts
at
civility
the
master
himself
avoided
offending
him
knowing
why
he
came
and
if
he
could
not
be
gracious
kept
out
of
the
way
i
rather
think
his
appearance
there
was
distasteful
to
catherine
she
was
not
artful
never
played
the
coquette
and
had
evidently
an
objection
to
her
two
friends
meeting
at
all
for
when
heathcliff
expressed
contempt
of
linton
in
his
presence
she
could
not
half
coincide
as
she
did
in
his
absence
and
when
linton
evinced
disgust
and
antipathy
to
heathcliff
she
dared
not
treat
his
sentiments
with
indifference
as
if
depreciation
of
her
playmate
were
of
scarcely
any
consequence
to
her
i
had
many
a
laugh
at
her
perplexities
and
untold
troubles
which
she
vainly
strove
to
hide
from
my
mockery
that
sounds
but
she
was
so
proud
it
became
really
impossible
to
pity
her
distresses
till
she
should
be
chastened
into
more
humility
she
did
bring
herself
finally
to
confess
and
to
confide
in
me
there
was
not
a
soul
else
that
she
might
fashion
into
an
adviser
hindley
had
gone
from
home
one
afternoon
and
heathcliff
presumed
to
give
himself
a
holiday
on
the
strength
of
it
he
had
reached
the
age
of
sixteen
then
i
think
and
without
having
bad
features
or
being
deficient
in
intellect
he
contrived
to
convey
an
impression
of
inward
and
outward
repulsiveness
that
his
present
aspect
retains
no
traces
of
in
the
first
place
he
had
by
that
time
lost
the
benefit
of
his
early
education
continual
hard
work
begun
soon
and
concluded
late
had
extinguished
any
curiosity
he
once
possessed
in
pursuit
of
knowledge
and
any
love
for
books
or
learning
his
childhood
sense
of
superiority
instilled
into
him
by
the
favours
of
old
earnshaw
was
faded
away
he
struggled
long
to
keep
up
an
equality
with
catherine
in
her
studies
and
yielded
with
poignant
though
silent
regret
but
he
yielded
completely
and
there
was
no
prevailing
on
him
to
take
a
step
in
the
way
of
moving
upward
when
he
found
he
must
necessarily
sink
beneath
his
former
level
then
personal
appearance
sympathised
with
mental
deterioration
he
acquired
a
slouching
gait
and
ignoble
look
his
naturally
reserved
disposition
was
exaggerated
into
an
almost
idiotic
excess
of
unsociable
moroseness
and
he
took
a
grim
pleasure
apparently
in
exciting
the
aversion
rather
than
the
esteem
of
his
few
acquaintances
catherine
and
he
were
constant
companions
still
at
his
seasons
of
respite
from
labour
but
he
had
ceased
to
express
his
fondness
for
her
in
words
and
recoiled
with
angry
suspicion
from
her
girlish
caresses
as
if
conscious
there
could
be
no
gratification
in
lavishing
such
marks
of
affection
on
him
on
the
occasion
he
came
into
the
house
to
announce
his
intention
of
doing
nothing
while
i
was
assisting
miss
cathy
to
arrange
her
dress
she
had
not
reckoned
on
his
taking
it
into
his
head
to
be
idle
and
imagining
she
would
have
the
whole
place
to
herself
she
managed
by
some
means
to
inform
edgar
of
her
brother
absence
and
was
then
preparing
to
receive
him
are
you
busy
this
afternoon
asked
heathcliff
you
going
anywhere
it
is
raining
she
answered
have
you
that
silk
frock
on
then
he
said
coming
here
i
hope
that
i
know
of
stammered
miss
you
should
be
in
the
field
now
heathcliff
it
is
an
hour
past
dinnertime
i
thought
you
were
gone
does
not
often
free
us
from
his
accursed
presence
observed
the
boy
not
work
any
more
i
stay
with
you
but
joseph
will
tell
she
suggested
better
go
is
loading
lime
on
the
further
side
of
penistone
crags
it
will
take
him
till
dark
and
he
never
know
so
saying
he
lounged
to
the
fire
and
sat
down
catherine
reflected
an
instant
with
knitted
brows
she
found
it
needful
to
smooth
the
way
for
an
intrusion
and
edgar
linton
talked
of
calling
this
afternoon
she
said
at
the
conclusion
of
a
minute
silence
it
rains
i
hardly
expect
them
but
they
may
come
and
if
they
do
you
run
the
risk
of
being
scolded
for
no
good
ellen
to
say
you
are
engaged
cathy
he
persisted
turn
me
out
for
those
pitiful
silly
friends
of
yours
i
on
the
point
sometimes
of
complaining
that
they
but
i
not
they
what
cried
catherine
gazing
at
him
with
a
troubled
countenance
nelly
she
added
petulantly
jerking
her
head
away
from
my
hands
combed
my
hair
quite
out
of
curl
that
enough
let
me
alone
what
are
you
on
the
point
of
complaining
about
heathcliff
only
look
at
the
almanack
on
that
wall
he
pointed
to
a
framed
sheet
hanging
near
the
window
and
continued
crosses
are
for
the
evenings
you
have
spent
with
the
lintons
the
dots
for
those
spent
with
me
do
you
see
i
marked
every
day
very
foolish
as
if
i
took
notice
replied
catherine
in
a
peevish
tone
where
is
the
sense
of
that
show
that
i
take
notice
said
heathcliff
should
i
always
be
sitting
with
you
she
demanded
growing
more
irritated
good
do
i
get
what
do
you
talk
about
you
might
be
dumb
or
a
baby
for
anything
you
say
to
amuse
me
or
for
anything
you
do
either
never
told
me
before
that
i
talked
too
little
or
that
you
disliked
my
company
cathy
exclaimed
heathcliff
in
much
agitation
no
company
at
all
when
people
know
nothing
and
say
nothing
she
muttered
her
companion
rose
up
but
he
had
time
to
express
his
feelings
further
for
a
horse
feet
were
heard
on
the
flags
and
having
knocked
gently
young
linton
entered
his
face
brilliant
with
delight
at
the
unexpected
summon
she
had
received
doubtless
catherine
marked
the
difference
between
her
friends
as
one
came
in
and
the
other
went
out
the
contrast
resembled
what
you
see
in
exchanging
a
bleak
hilly
coal
country
for
a
beautiful
fertile
valley
and
his
voice
and
greeting
were
as
opposite
as
his
aspect
he
had
a
sweet
low
manner
of
speaking
and
pronounced
his
words
as
you
do
that
less
gruff
than
we
talk
here
and
softer
not
come
too
soon
am
i
he
said
casting
a
look
at
me
i
had
begun
to
wipe
the
plate
and
tidy
some
drawers
at
the
far
end
in
the
dresser
answered
catherine
are
you
doing
there
nelly
work
miss
i
replied
hindley
had
given
me
directions
to
make
a
third
party
in
any
private
visits
linton
chose
to
pay
she
stepped
behind
me
and
whispered
crossly
yourself
and
your
dusters
off
when
company
are
in
the
house
servants
do
commence
scouring
and
cleaning
in
the
room
where
they
are
a
good
opportunity
now
that
master
is
away
i
answered
aloud
hates
me
to
be
fidgeting
over
these
things
in
his
presence
i
sure
edgar
will
excuse
me
hate
you
to
be
fidgeting
in
presence
exclaimed
the
young
lady
imperiously
not
allowing
her
guest
time
to
speak
she
had
failed
to
recover
her
equanimity
since
the
little
dispute
with
heathcliff
sorry
for
it
miss
catherine
was
my
response
and
i
proceeded
assiduously
with
my
occupation
she
supposing
edgar
could
not
see
her
snatched
the
cloth
from
my
hand
and
pinched
me
with
a
prolonged
wrench
very
spitefully
on
the
arm
said
i
did
not
love
her
and
rather
relished
mortifying
her
vanity
now
and
then
besides
she
hurt
me
extremely
so
i
started
up
from
my
knees
and
screamed
out
miss
that
a
nasty
trick
you
have
no
right
to
nip
me
and
i
not
going
to
bear
it
did
touch
you
you
lying
creature
cried
she
her
fingers
tingling
to
repeat
the
act
and
her
ears
red
with
rage
she
never
had
power
to
conceal
her
passion
it
always
set
her
whole
complexion
in
a
blaze
that
then
i
retorted
showing
a
decided
purple
witness
to
refute
her
she
stamped
her
foot
wavered
a
moment
and
then
irresistibly
impelled
by
the
naughty
spirit
within
her
slapped
me
on
the
cheek
a
stinging
blow
that
filled
both
eyes
with
water
love
catherine
interposed
linton
greatly
shocked
at
the
double
fault
of
falsehood
and
violence
which
his
idol
had
committed
the
room
ellen
she
repeated
trembling
all
over
little
hareton
who
followed
me
everywhere
and
was
sitting
near
me
on
the
floor
at
seeing
my
tears
commenced
crying
himself
and
sobbed
out
complaints
against
aunt
cathy
which
drew
her
fury
on
to
his
unlucky
head
she
seized
his
shoulders
and
shook
him
till
the
poor
child
waxed
livid
and
edgar
thoughtlessly
laid
hold
of
her
hands
to
deliver
him
in
an
instant
one
was
wrung
free
and
the
astonished
young
man
felt
it
applied
over
his
own
ear
in
a
way
that
could
not
be
mistaken
for
jest
he
drew
back
in
consternation
i
lifted
hareton
in
my
arms
and
walked
off
to
the
kitchen
with
him
leaving
the
door
of
communication
open
for
i
was
curious
to
watch
how
they
would
settle
their
disagreement
the
insulted
visitor
moved
to
the
spot
where
he
had
laid
his
hat
pale
and
with
a
quivering
lip
right
i
said
to
myself
warning
and
begone
it
a
kindness
to
let
you
have
a
glimpse
of
her
genuine
disposition
are
you
going
demanded
catherine
advancing
to
the
door
he
swerved
aside
and
attempted
to
pass
must
not
go
she
exclaimed
energetically
must
and
shall
he
replied
in
a
subdued
voice
she
persisted
grasping
the
handle
yet
edgar
linton
sit
down
you
shall
not
leave
me
in
that
temper
i
should
be
miserable
all
night
and
i
wo
be
miserable
for
you
i
stay
after
you
have
struck
me
asked
linton
catherine
was
mute
made
me
afraid
and
ashamed
of
you
he
continued
not
come
here
again
her
eyes
began
to
glisten
and
her
lids
to
twinkle
you
told
a
deliberate
untruth
he
said
did
she
cried
recovering
her
speech
did
nothing
deliberately
well
go
if
you
please
get
away
and
now
i
cry
cry
myself
sick
she
dropped
down
on
her
knees
by
a
chair
and
set
to
weeping
in
serious
earnest
edgar
persevered
in
his
resolution
as
far
as
the
court
there
he
lingered
i
resolved
to
encourage
him
is
dreadfully
wayward
sir
i
called
out
bad
as
any
marred
child
you
better
be
riding
home
or
else
she
will
be
sick
only
to
grieve
us
the
soft
thing
looked
askance
through
the
window
he
possessed
the
power
to
depart
as
much
as
a
cat
possesses
the
power
to
leave
a
mouse
half
killed
or
a
bird
half
eaten
ah
i
thought
there
will
be
no
saving
him
he
doomed
and
flies
to
his
fate
and
so
it
was
he
turned
abruptly
hastened
into
the
house
again
shut
the
door
behind
him
and
when
i
went
in
a
while
after
to
inform
them
that
earnshaw
had
come
home
rabid
drunk
ready
to
pull
the
whole
place
about
our
ears
his
ordinary
frame
of
mind
in
that
condition
i
saw
the
quarrel
had
merely
effected
a
closer
intimacy
had
broken
the
outworks
of
youthful
timidity
and
enabled
them
to
forsake
the
disguise
of
friendship
and
confess
themselves
lovers
intelligence
of
hindley
arrival
drove
linton
speedily
to
his
horse
and
catherine
to
her
chamber
i
went
to
hide
little
hareton
and
to
take
the
shot
out
of
the
master
which
he
was
fond
of
playing
with
in
his
insane
excitement
to
the
hazard
of
the
lives
of
any
who
provoked
or
even
attracted
his
notice
too
much
and
i
had
hit
upon
the
plan
of
removing
it
that
he
might
do
less
mischief
if
he
did
go
the
length
of
firing
the
gun
chapter
ix
he
entered
vociferating
oaths
dreadful
to
hear
and
caught
me
in
the
act
of
stowing
his
son
away
in
the
kitchen
cupboard
hareton
was
impressed
with
a
wholesome
terror
of
encountering
either
his
wild
beast
fondness
or
his
madman
rage
for
in
one
he
ran
a
chance
of
being
squeezed
and
kissed
to
death
and
in
the
other
of
being
flung
into
the
fire
or
dashed
against
the
wall
and
the
poor
thing
remained
perfectly
quiet
wherever
i
chose
to
put
him
i
found
it
out
at
last
cried
hindley
pulling
me
back
by
the
skin
of
my
neck
like
a
dog
heaven
and
hell
you
sworn
between
you
to
murder
that
child
i
know
how
it
is
now
that
he
is
always
out
of
my
way
but
with
the
help
of
satan
i
shall
make
you
swallow
the
nelly
you
need
laugh
for
i
just
crammed
kenneth
in
the
marsh
and
two
is
the
same
as
one
and
i
want
to
kill
some
of
you
i
shall
have
no
rest
till
i
do
i
do
like
the
hindley
i
answered
has
been
cutting
red
herrings
i
rather
be
shot
if
you
please
rather
be
damned
he
said
so
you
shall
no
law
in
england
can
hinder
a
man
from
keeping
his
house
decent
and
mine
abominable
open
your
mouth
he
held
the
knife
in
his
hand
and
pushed
its
point
between
my
teeth
but
for
my
part
i
was
never
much
afraid
of
his
vagaries
i
spat
out
and
affirmed
it
tasted
detestably
i
would
not
take
it
on
any
account
said
he
releasing
me
see
that
hideous
little
villain
is
not
hareton
i
beg
your
pardon
nell
if
it
be
he
deserves
flaying
alive
for
not
running
to
welcome
me
and
for
screaming
as
if
i
were
a
goblin
unnatural
cub
come
hither
i
teach
thee
to
impose
on
a
deluded
father
now
do
you
think
the
lad
would
be
handsomer
cropped
it
makes
a
dog
fiercer
and
i
love
something
fierce
get
me
a
scissors
something
fierce
and
trim
besides
it
infernal
affectation
devilish
conceit
it
is
to
cherish
our
ears
we
asses
enough
without
them
hush
child
hush
well
then
it
is
my
darling
wisht
dry
thy
eyes
there
a
joy
kiss
me
what
it
wo
kiss
me
hareton
damn
thee
kiss
me
by
god
as
if
i
would
rear
such
a
monster
as
sure
as
i
living
i
break
the
brat
neck
poor
hareton
was
squalling
and
kicking
in
his
father
arms
with
all
his
might
and
redoubled
his
yells
when
he
carried
him
and
lifted
him
over
the
banister
i
cried
out
that
he
would
frighten
the
child
into
fits
and
ran
to
rescue
him
as
i
reached
them
hindley
leant
forward
on
the
rails
to
listen
to
a
noise
below
almost
forgetting
what
he
had
in
his
hands
is
that
he
asked
hearing
some
one
approaching
the
i
leant
forward
also
for
the
purpose
of
signing
to
heathcliff
whose
step
i
recognised
not
to
come
further
and
at
the
instant
when
my
eye
quitted
hareton
he
gave
a
sudden
spring
delivered
himself
from
the
careless
grasp
that
held
him
and
fell
there
was
scarcely
time
to
experience
a
thrill
of
horror
before
we
saw
that
the
little
wretch
was
safe
heathcliff
arrived
underneath
just
at
the
critical
moment
by
a
natural
impulse
he
arrested
his
descent
and
setting
him
on
his
feet
looked
up
to
discover
the
author
of
the
accident
a
miser
who
has
parted
with
a
lucky
lottery
ticket
for
five
shillings
and
finds
next
day
he
has
lost
in
the
bargain
five
thousand
pounds
could
not
show
a
blanker
countenance
than
he
did
on
beholding
the
figure
of
earnshaw
above
it
expressed
plainer
than
words
could
do
the
intensest
anguish
at
having
made
himself
the
instrument
of
thwarting
his
own
revenge
had
it
been
dark
i
daresay
he
would
have
tried
to
remedy
the
mistake
by
smashing
hareton
skull
on
the
steps
but
we
witnessed
his
salvation
and
i
was
presently
below
with
my
precious
charge
pressed
to
my
heart
hindley
descended
more
leisurely
sobered
and
abashed
is
your
fault
ellen
he
said
should
have
kept
him
out
of
sight
you
should
have
taken
him
from
me
is
he
injured
anywhere
i
cried
angrily
he
is
not
killed
he
be
an
idiot
oh
i
wonder
his
mother
does
not
rise
from
her
grave
to
see
how
you
use
him
you
worse
than
a
heathen
treating
your
own
flesh
and
blood
in
that
manner
he
attempted
to
touch
the
child
who
on
finding
himself
with
me
sobbed
off
his
terror
directly
at
the
first
finger
his
father
laid
on
him
however
he
shrieked
again
louder
than
before
and
struggled
as
if
he
would
go
into
convulsions
shall
not
meddle
with
him
i
continued
hates
you
they
all
hate
you
that
the
truth
a
happy
family
you
have
and
a
pretty
state
you
come
to
shall
come
to
a
prettier
yet
nelly
laughed
the
misguided
man
recovering
his
hardness
present
convey
yourself
and
him
away
and
hark
you
heathcliff
clear
you
too
quite
from
my
reach
and
hearing
i
would
murder
you
unless
perhaps
i
set
the
house
on
fire
but
that
as
my
fancy
goes
while
saying
this
he
took
a
pint
bottle
of
brandy
from
the
dresser
and
poured
some
into
a
tumbler
do
i
entreated
hindley
do
take
warning
have
mercy
on
this
unfortunate
boy
if
you
care
nothing
for
yourself
one
will
do
better
for
him
than
i
shall
he
answered
mercy
on
your
own
soul
i
said
endeavouring
to
snatch
the
glass
from
his
hand
i
on
the
contrary
i
shall
have
great
pleasure
in
sending
it
to
perdition
to
punish
its
maker
exclaimed
the
blasphemer
to
its
hearty
damnation
he
drank
the
spirits
and
impatiently
bade
us
go
terminating
his
command
with
a
sequel
of
horrid
imprecations
too
bad
to
repeat
or
remember
a
pity
he
can
not
kill
himself
with
drink
observed
heathcliff
muttering
an
echo
of
curses
back
when
the
door
was
shut
doing
his
very
utmost
but
his
constitution
defies
him
kenneth
says
he
would
wager
his
mare
that
he
outlive
any
man
on
this
side
gimmerton
and
go
to
the
grave
a
hoary
sinner
unless
some
happy
chance
out
of
the
common
course
befall
him
i
went
into
the
kitchen
and
sat
down
to
lull
my
little
lamb
to
sleep
heathcliff
as
i
thought
walked
through
to
the
barn
it
turned
out
afterwards
that
he
only
got
as
far
as
the
other
side
the
settle
when
he
flung
himself
on
a
bench
by
the
wall
removed
from
the
fire
and
remained
silent
i
was
rocking
hareton
on
my
knee
and
humming
a
song
that
began
it
was
far
in
the
night
and
the
bairnies
grat
the
mither
beneath
the
mools
heard
that
when
miss
cathy
who
had
listened
to
the
hubbub
from
her
room
put
her
head
in
and
whispered
you
alone
nelly
miss
i
replied
she
entered
and
approached
the
hearth
i
supposing
she
was
going
to
say
something
looked
up
the
expression
of
her
face
seemed
disturbed
and
anxious
her
lips
were
half
asunder
as
if
she
meant
to
speak
and
she
drew
a
breath
but
it
escaped
in
a
sigh
instead
of
a
sentence
i
resumed
my
song
not
having
forgotten
her
recent
behaviour
heathcliff
she
said
interrupting
me
his
work
in
the
stable
was
my
answer
he
did
not
contradict
me
perhaps
he
had
fallen
into
a
doze
there
followed
another
long
pause
during
which
i
perceived
a
drop
or
two
trickle
from
catherine
cheek
to
the
flags
is
she
sorry
for
her
shameful
conduct
i
asked
myself
that
will
be
a
novelty
but
she
may
come
to
the
point
as
she
will
i
help
her
no
she
felt
small
trouble
regarding
any
subject
save
her
own
concerns
dear
she
cried
at
last
very
unhappy
pity
observed
i
hard
to
please
so
many
friends
and
so
few
cares
and
ca
make
yourself
content
will
you
keep
a
secret
for
me
she
pursued
kneeling
down
by
me
and
lifting
her
winsome
eyes
to
my
face
with
that
sort
of
look
which
turns
off
bad
temper
even
when
one
has
all
the
right
in
the
world
to
indulge
it
it
worth
keeping
i
inquired
less
sulkily
and
it
worries
me
and
i
must
let
it
out
i
want
to
know
what
i
should
do
edgar
linton
has
asked
me
to
marry
him
and
given
him
an
answer
now
before
i
tell
you
whether
it
was
a
consent
or
denial
you
tell
me
which
it
ought
to
have
been
miss
catherine
how
can
i
know
i
replied
be
sure
considering
the
exhibition
you
performed
in
his
presence
this
afternoon
i
might
say
it
would
be
wise
to
refuse
him
since
he
asked
you
after
that
he
must
either
be
hopelessly
stupid
or
a
venturesome
fool
you
talk
so
i
wo
tell
you
any
more
she
returned
peevishly
rising
to
her
feet
accepted
him
nelly
be
quick
and
say
whether
i
was
wrong
accepted
him
then
what
good
is
it
discussing
the
matter
you
have
pledged
your
word
and
can
not
retract
say
whether
i
should
have
done
so
do
she
exclaimed
in
an
irritated
tone
chafing
her
hands
together
and
frowning
are
many
things
to
be
considered
before
that
question
can
be
answered
properly
i
said
sententiously
and
foremost
do
you
love
mr
edgar
can
help
it
of
course
i
do
she
answered
then
i
put
her
through
the
following
catechism
for
a
girl
of
it
was
not
injudicious
do
you
love
him
miss
cathy
i
do
that
sufficient
no
means
you
must
say
why
because
he
is
handsome
and
pleasant
to
be
with
was
my
commentary
because
he
is
young
and
cheerful
still
because
he
loves
me
coming
there
he
will
be
rich
and
i
shall
like
to
be
the
greatest
woman
of
the
neighbourhood
and
i
shall
be
proud
of
having
such
a
husband
of
all
and
now
say
how
you
love
him
everybody
loves
you
silly
nelly
at
all
answer
love
the
ground
under
his
feet
and
the
air
over
his
head
and
everything
he
touches
and
every
word
he
says
i
love
all
his
looks
and
all
his
actions
and
him
entirely
and
altogether
there
now
why
you
are
making
a
jest
of
it
it
is
exceedingly
no
jest
to
me
said
the
young
lady
scowling
and
turning
her
face
to
the
fire
very
far
from
jesting
miss
catherine
i
replied
love
edgar
because
he
is
handsome
and
young
and
cheerful
and
rich
and
loves
you
the
last
however
goes
for
nothing
you
would
love
him
without
that
probably
and
with
it
you
would
unless
he
possessed
the
four
former
attractions
to
be
sure
not
i
should
only
pity
him
hate
him
perhaps
if
he
were
ugly
and
a
clown
there
are
several
other
handsome
rich
young
men
in
the
world
handsomer
possibly
and
richer
than
he
is
what
should
hinder
you
from
loving
them
there
be
any
they
are
out
of
my
way
i
seen
none
like
edgar
may
see
some
and
he
wo
always
be
handsome
and
young
and
may
not
always
be
rich
is
now
and
i
have
only
to
do
with
the
present
i
wish
you
would
speak
rationally
that
settles
it
if
you
have
only
to
do
with
the
present
marry
mr
linton
do
want
your
permission
for
that
i
marry
him
and
yet
you
have
not
told
me
whether
i
right
right
if
people
be
right
to
marry
only
for
the
present
and
now
let
us
hear
what
you
are
unhappy
about
your
brother
will
be
pleased
the
old
lady
and
gentleman
will
not
object
i
think
you
will
escape
from
a
disorderly
comfortless
home
into
a
wealthy
respectable
one
and
you
love
edgar
and
edgar
loves
you
all
seems
smooth
and
easy
where
is
the
obstacle
and
replied
catherine
striking
one
hand
on
her
forehead
and
the
other
on
her
breast
whichever
place
the
soul
lives
in
my
soul
and
in
my
heart
i
convinced
i
wrong
very
strange
i
can
not
make
it
out
my
secret
but
if
you
will
not
mock
at
me
i
explain
it
i
ca
do
it
distinctly
but
i
give
you
a
feeling
of
how
i
feel
she
seated
herself
by
me
again
her
countenance
grew
sadder
and
graver
and
her
clasped
hands
trembled
do
you
never
dream
queer
dreams
she
said
suddenly
after
some
minutes
reflection
now
and
then
i
answered
so
do
i
dreamt
in
my
life
dreams
that
have
stayed
with
me
ever
after
and
changed
my
ideas
they
gone
through
and
through
me
like
wine
through
water
and
altered
the
colour
of
my
mind
and
this
is
one
i
going
to
tell
it
but
take
care
not
to
smile
at
any
part
of
it
do
miss
catherine
i
cried
dismal
enough
without
conjuring
up
ghosts
and
visions
to
perplex
us
come
come
be
merry
and
like
yourself
look
at
little
hareton
dreaming
nothing
dreary
how
sweetly
he
smiles
in
his
sleep
and
how
sweetly
his
father
curses
in
his
solitude
you
remember
him
i
daresay
when
he
was
just
such
another
as
that
chubby
thing
nearly
as
young
and
innocent
however
nelly
i
shall
oblige
you
to
listen
it
not
long
and
i
no
power
to
be
merry
wo
hear
it
i
wo
hear
it
i
repeated
hastily
i
was
superstitious
about
dreams
then
and
am
still
and
catherine
had
an
unusual
gloom
in
her
aspect
that
made
me
dread
something
from
which
i
might
shape
a
prophecy
and
foresee
a
fearful
catastrophe
she
was
vexed
but
she
did
not
proceed
apparently
taking
up
another
subject
she
recommenced
in
a
short
time
i
were
in
heaven
nelly
i
should
be
extremely
miserable
you
are
not
fit
to
go
there
i
answered
sinners
would
be
miserable
in
heaven
it
is
not
for
that
i
dreamt
once
that
i
was
there
tell
you
i
wo
hearken
to
your
dreams
miss
catherine
i
go
to
bed
i
interrupted
again
she
laughed
and
held
me
down
for
i
made
a
motion
to
leave
my
chair
is
nothing
cried
she
was
only
going
to
say
that
heaven
did
not
seem
to
be
my
home
and
i
broke
my
heart
with
weeping
to
come
back
to
earth
and
the
angels
were
so
angry
that
they
flung
me
out
into
the
middle
of
the
heath
on
the
top
of
wuthering
heights
where
i
woke
sobbing
for
joy
that
will
do
to
explain
my
secret
as
well
as
the
other
no
more
business
to
marry
edgar
linton
than
i
have
to
be
in
heaven
and
if
the
wicked
man
in
there
had
not
brought
heathcliff
so
low
i
have
thought
of
it
it
would
degrade
me
to
marry
heathcliff
now
so
he
shall
never
know
how
i
love
him
and
that
not
because
he
handsome
nelly
but
because
he
more
myself
than
i
am
whatever
our
souls
are
made
of
his
and
mine
are
the
same
and
linton
is
as
different
as
a
moonbeam
from
lightning
or
frost
from
fire
ere
this
speech
ended
i
became
sensible
of
heathcliff
presence
having
noticed
a
slight
movement
i
turned
my
head
and
saw
him
rise
from
the
bench
and
steal
out
noiselessly
he
had
listened
till
he
heard
catherine
say
it
would
degrade
her
to
marry
him
and
then
he
stayed
to
hear
no
further
my
companion
sitting
on
the
ground
was
prevented
by
the
back
of
the
settle
from
remarking
his
presence
or
departure
but
i
started
and
bade
her
hush
she
asked
gazing
nervously
round
is
here
i
answered
catching
opportunely
the
roll
of
his
cartwheels
up
the
road
heathcliff
will
come
in
with
him
i
not
sure
whether
he
were
not
at
the
door
this
moment
he
could
overhear
me
at
the
door
said
she
me
hareton
while
you
get
the
supper
and
when
it
is
ready
ask
me
to
sup
with
you
i
want
to
cheat
my
uncomfortable
conscience
and
be
convinced
that
heathcliff
has
no
notion
of
these
things
he
has
not
has
he
he
does
not
know
what
being
in
love
is
see
no
reason
that
he
should
not
know
as
well
as
you
i
returned
if
you
are
his
choice
he
be
the
most
unfortunate
creature
that
ever
was
born
as
soon
as
you
become
linton
he
loses
friend
and
love
and
all
have
you
considered
how
you
bear
the
separation
and
how
he
bear
to
be
quite
deserted
in
the
world
because
miss
catherine
quite
deserted
we
separated
she
exclaimed
with
an
accent
of
indignation
is
to
separate
us
pray
they
meet
the
fate
of
milo
not
as
long
as
i
live
ellen
for
no
mortal
creature
every
linton
on
the
face
of
the
earth
might
melt
into
nothing
before
i
could
consent
to
forsake
heathcliff
oh
that
not
what
i
intend
that
not
what
i
mean
i
should
be
linton
were
such
a
price
demanded
he
be
as
much
to
me
as
he
has
been
all
his
lifetime
edgar
must
shake
off
his
antipathy
and
tolerate
him
at
least
he
will
when
he
learns
my
true
feelings
towards
him
nelly
i
see
now
you
think
me
a
selfish
wretch
but
did
it
never
strike
you
that
if
heathcliff
and
i
married
we
should
be
beggars
whereas
if
i
marry
linton
i
can
aid
heathcliff
to
rise
and
place
him
out
of
my
brother
power
your
husband
money
miss
catherine
i
asked
find
him
not
so
pliable
as
you
calculate
upon
and
though
i
hardly
a
judge
i
think
that
the
worst
motive
you
given
yet
for
being
the
wife
of
young
linton
is
not
retorted
she
is
the
best
the
others
were
the
satisfaction
of
my
whims
and
for
edgar
sake
too
to
satisfy
him
this
is
for
the
sake
of
one
who
comprehends
in
his
person
my
feelings
to
edgar
and
myself
i
can
not
express
it
but
surely
you
and
everybody
have
a
notion
that
there
is
or
should
be
an
existence
of
yours
beyond
you
what
were
the
use
of
my
creation
if
i
were
entirely
contained
here
my
great
miseries
in
this
world
have
been
heathcliff
miseries
and
i
watched
and
felt
each
from
the
beginning
my
great
thought
in
living
is
himself
if
all
else
perished
and
remained
should
still
continue
to
be
and
if
all
else
remained
and
he
were
annihilated
the
universe
would
turn
to
a
mighty
stranger
i
should
not
seem
a
part
of
my
love
for
linton
is
like
the
foliage
in
the
woods
time
will
change
it
i
well
aware
as
winter
changes
the
trees
my
love
for
heathcliff
resembles
the
eternal
rocks
beneath
a
source
of
little
visible
delight
but
necessary
nelly
i
heathcliff
he
always
always
in
my
mind
not
as
a
pleasure
any
more
than
i
am
always
a
pleasure
to
myself
but
as
my
own
being
so
do
talk
of
our
separation
again
it
is
impracticable
and
she
paused
and
hid
her
face
in
the
folds
of
my
gown
but
i
jerked
it
forcibly
away
i
was
out
of
patience
with
her
folly
i
can
make
any
sense
of
your
nonsense
miss
i
said
only
goes
to
convince
me
that
you
are
ignorant
of
the
duties
you
undertake
in
marrying
or
else
that
you
are
a
wicked
unprincipled
girl
but
trouble
me
with
no
more
secrets
i
not
promise
to
keep
them
keep
that
she
asked
eagerly
i
not
promise
i
repeated
she
was
about
to
insist
when
the
entrance
of
joseph
finished
our
conversation
and
catherine
removed
her
seat
to
a
corner
and
nursed
hareton
while
i
made
the
supper
after
it
was
cooked
my
and
i
began
to
quarrel
who
should
carry
some
to
hindley
and
we
did
settle
it
till
all
was
nearly
cold
then
we
came
to
the
agreement
that
we
would
let
him
ask
if
he
wanted
any
for
we
feared
particularly
to
go
into
his
presence
when
he
had
been
some
time
alone
how
is
that
nowt
comed
in
fro
th
field
be
this
time
what
is
he
about
girt
idle
seeght
demanded
the
old
man
looking
round
for
heathcliff
call
him
i
replied
in
the
barn
i
no
doubt
i
went
and
called
but
got
no
answer
on
returning
i
whispered
to
catherine
that
he
had
heard
a
good
part
of
what
she
said
i
was
sure
and
told
how
i
saw
him
quit
the
kitchen
just
as
she
complained
of
her
brother
conduct
regarding
him
she
jumped
up
in
a
fine
fright
flung
hareton
on
to
the
settle
and
ran
to
seek
for
her
friend
herself
not
taking
leisure
to
consider
why
she
was
so
flurried
or
how
her
talk
would
have
affected
him
she
was
absent
such
a
while
that
joseph
proposed
we
should
wait
no
longer
he
cunningly
conjectured
they
were
staying
away
in
order
to
avoid
hearing
his
protracted
blessing
they
were
eneugh
for
ony
fahl
manners
he
affirmed
and
on
their
behalf
he
added
that
night
a
special
prayer
to
the
usual
supplication
before
meat
and
would
have
tacked
another
to
the
end
of
the
grace
had
not
his
young
mistress
broken
in
upon
him
with
a
hurried
command
that
he
must
run
down
the
road
and
wherever
heathcliff
had
rambled
find
and
make
him
directly
want
to
speak
to
him
and
i
before
i
go
upstairs
she
said
the
gate
is
open
he
is
somewhere
out
of
hearing
for
he
would
not
reply
though
i
shouted
at
the
top
of
the
fold
as
loud
as
i
could
joseph
objected
at
first
she
was
too
much
in
earnest
however
to
suffer
contradiction
and
at
last
he
placed
his
hat
on
his
head
and
walked
grumbling
forth
meantime
catherine
paced
up
and
down
the
floor
exclaiming
wonder
where
he
is
i
wonder
where
he
can
be
what
did
i
say
nelly
i
forgotten
was
he
vexed
at
my
bad
humour
this
afternoon
dear
tell
me
what
i
said
to
grieve
him
i
do
wish
come
i
do
wish
he
would
a
noise
for
nothing
i
cried
though
rather
uneasy
myself
a
trifle
scares
you
it
surely
no
great
cause
of
alarm
that
heathcliff
should
take
a
moonlight
saunter
on
the
moors
or
even
lie
too
sulky
to
speak
to
us
in
the
i
engage
he
lurking
there
see
if
i
do
ferret
him
out
i
departed
to
renew
my
search
its
result
was
disappointment
and
joseph
quest
ended
in
the
same
lad

he
be

hard
o
hearing
wi
it
a
very
dark
evening
for
summer
the
clouds
appeared
inclined
to
thunder
and
i
said
we
had
better
all
sit
down
the
approaching
rain
would
be
certain
to
bring
him
home
without
further
trouble
however
catherine
would
not
be
persuaded
into
tranquillity
she
kept
wandering
to
and
fro
from
the
gate
to
the
door
in
a
state
of
agitation
which
permitted
no
repose
and
at
length
took
up
a
permanent
situation
on
one
side
of
the
wall
near
the
road
where
heedless
of
my
expostulations
and
the
growling
thunder
and
the
great
drops
that
began
to
plash
around
her
she
remained
calling
at
intervals
and
then
listening
and
then
crying
outright
she
beat
hareton
or
any
child
at
a
good
passionate
fit
of
crying
about
midnight
while
we
still
sat
up
the
storm
came
rattling
over
the
heights
in
full
fury
there
was
a
violent
wind
as
well
as
thunder
and
either
one
or
the
other
split
a
tree
off
at
the
corner
of
the
building
a
huge
bough
fell
across
the
roof
and
knocked
down
a
portion
of
the
east
sending
a
clatter
of
stones
and
soot
into
the
we
thought
a
bolt
had
fallen
in
the
middle
of
us
and
joseph
swung
on
to
his
knees
beseeching
the
lord
to
remember
the
patriarchs
noah
and
lot
and
as
in
former
times
spare
the
righteous
though
he
smote
the
ungodly
i
felt
some
sentiment
that
it
must
be
a
judgment
on
us
also
the
jonah
in
my
mind
was
earnshaw
and
i
shook
the
handle
of
his
den
that
i
might
ascertain
if
he
were
yet
living
he
replied
audibly
enough
in
a
fashion
which
made
my
companion
vociferate
more
clamorously
than
before
that
a
wide
distinction
might
be
drawn
between
saints
like
himself
and
sinners
like
his
master
but
the
uproar
passed
away
in
twenty
minutes
leaving
us
all
unharmed
excepting
cathy
who
got
thoroughly
drenched
for
her
obstinacy
in
refusing
to
take
shelter
and
standing
bonnetless
and
shawlless
to
catch
as
much
water
as
she
could
with
her
hair
and
clothes
she
came
in
and
lay
down
on
the
settle
all
soaked
as
she
was
turning
her
face
to
the
back
and
putting
her
hands
before
it
miss
i
exclaimed
touching
her
shoulder
are
not
bent
on
getting
your
death
are
you
do
you
know
what
it
is
twelve
come
come

there
no
use
waiting
any
longer
on
that
foolish
boy
he
be
gone
to
gimmerton
and
he
stay
there
now
he
guesses
we
should
wait
for
him
till
this
late
hour
at
least
he
guesses
that
only
hindley
would
be
up
and
he
rather
avoid
having
the
door
opened
by
the
master
nay
he
noan
at
gimmerton
said
joseph
niver

but

rubbidge
yah
knaw

ses
and
he
began
quoting
several
texts
referring
us
to
chapters
and
verses
where
we
might
find
them
i
having
vainly
begged
the
wilful
girl
to
rise
and
remove
her
wet
things
left
him
preaching
and
her
shivering
and
betook
myself
to
bed
with
little
hareton
who
slept
as
fast
as
if
everyone
had
been
sleeping
round
him
i
heard
joseph
read
on
a
while
afterwards
then
i
distinguished
his
slow
step
on
the
ladder
and
then
i
dropped
asleep
coming
down
somewhat
later
than
usual
i
saw
by
the
sunbeams
piercing
the
chinks
of
the
shutters
miss
catherine
still
seated
near
the
fireplace
the
was
ajar
too
light
entered
from
its
unclosed
windows
hindley
had
come
out
and
stood
on
the
kitchen
hearth
haggard
and
drowsy
ails
you
cathy
he
was
saying
when
i
entered
look
as
dismal
as
a
drowned
whelp
why
are
you
so
damp
and
pale
child
been
wet
she
answered
reluctantly
i
cold
that
all
she
is
naughty
i
cried
perceiving
the
master
to
be
tolerably
sober
got
steeped
in
the
shower
of
yesterday
evening
and
there
she
has
sat
the
night
through
and
i
could
prevail
on
her
to
stir
earnshaw
stared
at
us
in
surprise
night
through
he
repeated
kept
her
up
not
fear
of
the
thunder
surely
that
was
over
hours
since
neither
of
us
wished
to
mention
heathcliff
absence
as
long
as
we
could
conceal
it
so
i
replied
i
did
know
how
she
took
it
into
her
head
to
sit
up
and
she
said
nothing
the
morning
was
fresh
and
cool
i
threw
back
the
lattice
and
presently
the
room
filled
with
sweet
scents
from
the
garden
but
catherine
called
peevishly
to
me
shut
the
window
i
starving
and
her
teeth
chattered
as
she
shrank
closer
to
the
almost
extinguished
embers
ill
said
hindley
taking
her
wrist
suppose
that
the
reason
she
would
not
go
to
bed
damn
it
i
do
want
to
be
troubled
with
more
sickness
here
what
took
you
into
the
rain
after
t
lads
as
usuald
croaked
joseph
catching
an
opportunity
from
our
hesitation
to
thrust
in
his
evil
tongue
i

maister
i
just
slam

i
their

of

heathcliff
they

but
i

nip

and
bolt
into
th
house
t
minute
yah
heard
maister
clatter
up
t
road
eavesdropper
cried
catherine
of
your
insolence
before
me
edgar
linton
came
yesterday
by
chance
hindley
and
it
was
who
told
him
to
be
off
because
i
knew
you
would
not
like
to
have
met
him
as
you
were
lie
cathy
no
doubt
answered
her
brother
you
are
a
confounded
simpleton
but
never
mind
linton
at
present
tell
me
were
you
not
with
heathcliff
last
night
speak
the
truth
now
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
harming
him
though
i
hate
him
as
much
as
ever
he
did
me
a
good
turn
a
short
time
since
that
will
make
my
conscience
tender
of
breaking
his
neck
to
prevent
it
i
shall
send
him
about
his
business
this
very
morning
and
after
he
gone
i
advise
you
all
to
look
sharp
i
shall
only
have
the
more
humour
for
you
never
saw
heathcliff
last
night
answered
catherine
beginning
to
sob
bitterly
if
you
do
turn
him
out
of
doors
i
go
with
him
but
perhaps
you
never
have
an
opportunity
perhaps
he
gone
here
she
burst
into
uncontrollable
grief
and
the
remainder
of
her
words
were
inarticulate
hindley
lavished
on
her
a
torrent
of
scornful
abuse
and
bade
her
get
to
her
room
immediately
or
she
should
cry
for
nothing
i
obliged
her
to
obey
and
i
shall
never
forget
what
a
scene
she
acted
when
we
reached
her
chamber
it
terrified
me
i
thought
she
was
going
mad
and
i
begged
joseph
to
run
for
the
doctor
it
proved
the
commencement
of
delirium
kenneth
as
soon
as
he
saw
her
pronounced
her
dangerously
ill
she
had
a
fever
he
bled
her
and
he
told
me
to
let
her
live
on
whey
and
and
take
care
she
did
not
throw
herself
downstairs
or
out
of
the
window
and
then
he
left
for
he
had
enough
to
do
in
the
parish
where
two
or
three
miles
was
the
ordinary
distance
between
cottage
and
cottage
though
i
can
not
say
i
made
a
gentle
nurse
and
joseph
and
the
master
were
no
better
and
though
our
patient
was
as
wearisome
and
headstrong
as
a
patient
could
be
she
weathered
it
through
old
linton
paid
us
several
visits
to
be
sure
and
set
things
to
rights
and
scolded
and
ordered
us
all
and
when
catherine
was
convalescent
she
insisted
on
conveying
her
to
thrushcross
grange
for
which
deliverance
we
were
very
grateful
but
the
poor
dame
had
reason
to
repent
of
her
kindness
she
and
her
husband
both
took
the
fever
and
died
within
a
few
days
of
each
other
our
young
lady
returned
to
us
saucier
and
more
passionate
and
haughtier
than
ever
heathcliff
had
never
been
heard
of
since
the
evening
of
the
and
one
day
i
had
the
misfortune
when
she
had
provoked
me
exceedingly
to
lay
the
blame
of
his
disappearance
on
her
where
indeed
it
belonged
as
she
well
knew
from
that
period
for
several
months
she
ceased
to
hold
any
communication
with
me
save
in
the
relation
of
a
mere
servant
joseph
fell
under
a
ban
also
he
would
speak
his
mind
and
lecture
her
all
the
same
as
if
she
were
a
little
girl
and
she
esteemed
herself
a
woman
and
our
mistress
and
thought
that
her
recent
illness
gave
her
a
claim
to
be
treated
with
consideration
then
the
doctor
had
said
that
she
would
not
bear
crossing
much
she
ought
to
have
her
own
way
and
it
was
nothing
less
than
murder
in
her
eyes
for
any
one
to
presume
to
stand
up
and
contradict
her
from
earnshaw
and
his
companions
she
kept
aloof
and
tutored
by
kenneth
and
serious
threats
of
a
fit
that
often
attended
her
rages
her
brother
allowed
her
whatever
she
pleased
to
demand
and
generally
avoided
aggravating
her
fiery
temper
he
was
rather
too
indulgent
in
humouring
her
caprices
not
from
affection
but
from
pride
he
wished
earnestly
to
see
her
bring
honour
to
the
family
by
an
alliance
with
the
lintons
and
as
long
as
she
let
him
alone
she
might
trample
on
us
like
slaves
for
aught
he
cared
edgar
linton
as
multitudes
have
been
before
and
will
be
after
him
was
infatuated
and
believed
himself
the
happiest
man
alive
on
the
day
he
led
her
to
gimmerton
chapel
three
years
subsequent
to
his
father
death
much
against
my
inclination
i
was
persuaded
to
leave
wuthering
heights
and
accompany
her
here
little
hareton
was
nearly
five
years
old
and
i
had
just
begun
to
teach
him
his
letters
we
made
a
sad
parting
but
catherine
tears
were
more
powerful
than
ours
when
i
refused
to
go
and
when
she
found
her
entreaties
did
not
move
me
she
went
lamenting
to
her
husband
and
brother
the
former
offered
me
munificent
wages
the
latter
ordered
me
to
pack
up
he
wanted
no
women
in
the
house
he
said
now
that
there
was
no
mistress
and
as
to
hareton
the
curate
should
take
him
in
hand
and
so
i
had
but
one
choice
left
to
do
as
i
was
ordered
i
told
the
master
he
got
rid
of
all
decent
people
only
to
run
to
ruin
a
little
faster
i
kissed
hareton
said
and
since
then
he
has
been
a
stranger
and
it
very
queer
to
think
it
but
i
no
doubt
he
has
completely
forgotten
all
about
ellen
dean
and
that
he
was
ever
more
than
all
the
world
to
her
and
she
to
him
at
this
point
of
the
housekeeper
story
she
chanced
to
glance
towards
the
over
the
chimney
and
was
in
amazement
on
seeing
the
measure
one
she
would
not
hear
of
staying
a
second
longer
in
truth
i
felt
rather
disposed
to
defer
the
sequel
of
her
narrative
myself
and
now
that
she
is
vanished
to
her
rest
and
i
have
meditated
for
another
hour
or
two
i
shall
summon
courage
to
go
also
in
spite
of
aching
laziness
of
head
and
limbs

torture
tossing

oh
these
bleak

bitter
northern

and
impassable
roads
and
dilatory
country
surgeons
and
oh
this
dearth
of
the

heathcliff
has
just
honoured
me
with
a
call
about
seven
days
ago
he
sent
me
a
brace
of
grouse
the
last
of
the
season
scoundrel
he
is
not
altogether
guiltless
in
this
illness
of
mine
and
that
i
had
a
great
mind
to
tell
him
but
alas
how
could
i
offend
a
man
who
was
charitable
enough
to
sit
at
my
bedside
a
good
hour
and
talk
on
some
other
subject
than
pills
and
draughts
blisters
and
leeches
this
is
quite
an
easy
interval
i
am
too
weak
to
read
yet
i
feel
as
if
i
could
enjoy
something
interesting
why
not
have
up
dean
to
finish
her
tale
i
can
recollect
its
chief
incidents
as
far
as
she
had
gone
yes
i
remember
her
hero
had
run
off
and
never
been
heard
of
for
three
years
and
the
heroine
was
married
i
ring
she
be
delighted
to
find
me
capable
of
talking
cheerfully
dean
came
wants
twenty
minutes
sir
to
taking
the
medicine
she
commenced
away
with
it
i
replied
desire
to
have
doctor
says
you
must
drop
the
powders
all
my
heart
do
interrupt
me
come
and
take
your
seat
here
keep
your
fingers
from
that
bitter
phalanx
of
vials
draw
your
knitting
out
of
your
pocket
that
will
do
now
continue
the
history
of
heathcliff
from
where
you
left
off
to
the
present
day
did
he
finish
his
education
on
the
continent
and
come
back
a
gentleman
or
did
he
get
a
sizar
place
at
college
or
escape
to
america
and
earn
honours
by
drawing
blood
from
his
or
make
a
fortune
more
promptly
on
the
english
highways
may
have
done
a
little
in
all
these
vocations
lockwood
but
i
could
give
my
word
for
any
i
stated
before
that
i
did
know
how
he
gained
his
money
neither
am
i
aware
of
the
means
he
took
to
raise
his
mind
from
the
savage
ignorance
into
which
it
was
sunk
but
with
your
leave
i
proceed
in
my
own
fashion
if
you
think
it
will
amuse
and
not
weary
you
are
you
feeling
better
this
morning
good
news
i
got
miss
catherine
and
myself
to
thrushcross
grange
and
to
my
agreeable
disappointment
she
behaved
infinitely
better
than
i
dared
to
expect
she
seemed
almost
of
linton
and
even
to
his
sister
she
showed
plenty
of
affection
they
were
both
very
attentive
to
her
comfort
certainly
it
was
not
the
thorn
bending
to
the
honeysuckles
but
the
honeysuckles
embracing
the
thorn
there
were
no
mutual
concessions
one
stood
erect
and
the
others
yielded
and
who
can
be
and
when
they
encounter
neither
opposition
nor
indifference
i
observed
that
edgar
had
a
fear
of
ruffling
her
humour
he
concealed
it
from
her
but
if
ever
he
heard
me
answer
sharply
or
saw
any
other
servant
grow
cloudy
at
some
imperious
order
of
hers
he
would
show
his
trouble
by
a
frown
of
displeasure
that
never
darkened
on
his
own
account
he
many
a
time
spoke
sternly
to
me
about
my
pertness
and
averred
that
the
stab
of
a
knife
could
not
inflict
a
worse
pang
than
he
suffered
at
seeing
his
lady
vexed
not
to
grieve
a
kind
master
i
learned
to
be
less
touchy
and
for
the
space
of
half
a
year
the
gunpowder
lay
as
harmless
as
sand
because
no
fire
came
near
to
explode
it
catherine
had
seasons
of
gloom
and
silence
now
and
then
they
were
respected
with
sympathising
silence
by
her
husband
who
ascribed
them
to
an
alteration
in
her
constitution
produced
by
her
perilous
illness
as
she
was
never
subject
to
depression
of
spirits
before
the
return
of
sunshine
was
welcomed
by
answering
sunshine
from
him
i
believe
i
may
assert
that
they
were
really
in
possession
of
deep
and
growing
happiness
it
ended
well
we
be
for
ourselves
in
the
long
run
the
mild
and
generous
are
only
more
justly
selfish
than
the
domineering
and
it
ended
when
circumstances
caused
each
to
feel
that
the
one
interest
was
not
the
chief
consideration
in
the
other
thoughts
on
a
mellow
evening
in
september
i
was
coming
from
the
garden
with
a
heavy
basket
of
apples
which
i
had
been
gathering
it
had
got
dusk
and
the
moon
looked
over
the
high
wall
of
the
court
causing
undefined
shadows
to
lurk
in
the
corners
of
the
numerous
projecting
portions
of
the
building
i
set
my
burden
on
the
by
the
and
lingered
to
rest
and
drew
in
a
few
more
breaths
of
the
soft
sweet
air
my
eyes
were
on
the
moon
and
my
back
to
the
entrance
when
i
heard
a
voice
behind
me
say
is
that
you
it
was
a
deep
voice
and
foreign
in
tone
yet
there
was
something
in
the
manner
of
pronouncing
my
name
which
made
it
sound
familiar
i
turned
about
to
discover
who
spoke
fearfully
for
the
doors
were
shut
and
i
had
seen
nobody
on
approaching
the
steps
something
stirred
in
the
porch
and
moving
nearer
i
distinguished
a
tall
man
dressed
in
dark
clothes
with
dark
face
and
hair
he
leant
against
the
side
and
held
his
fingers
on
the
latch
as
if
intending
to
open
for
himself
can
it
be
i
thought
earnshaw
oh
no
the
voice
has
no
resemblance
to
his
have
waited
here
an
hour
he
resumed
while
i
continued
staring
the
whole
of
that
time
all
round
has
been
as
still
as
death
i
dared
not
enter
you
do
not
know
me
look
i
not
a
stranger
a
ray
fell
on
his
features
the
cheeks
were
sallow
and
half
covered
with
black
whiskers
the
brows
lowering
the
eyes
and
singular
i
remembered
the
eyes
i
cried
uncertain
whether
to
regard
him
as
a
worldly
visitor
and
i
raised
my
hands
in
amazement
you
come
back
is
it
really
you
is
it
heathcliff
he
replied
glancing
from
me
up
to
the
windows
which
reflected
a
score
of
glittering
moons
but
showed
no
lights
from
within
they
at
home
where
is
she
nelly
you
are
not
glad
you
need
be
so
disturbed
is
she
here
speak
i
want
to
have
one
word
with
her
your
mistress
go
and
say
some
person
from
gimmerton
desires
to
see
her
will
she
take
it
i
exclaimed
will
she
do
the
surprise
bewilders
me
it
will
put
her
out
of
her
head
and
you
heathcliff
but
altered
nay
there
no
comprehending
it
have
you
been
for
a
soldier
and
carry
my
message
he
interrupted
impatiently
in
hell
till
you
do
he
lifted
the
latch
and
i
entered
but
when
i
got
to
the
parlour
where
and
linton
were
i
could
not
persuade
myself
to
proceed
at
length
i
resolved
on
making
an
excuse
to
ask
if
they
would
have
the
candles
lighted
and
i
opened
the
door
they
sat
together
in
a
window
whose
lattice
lay
back
against
the
wall
and
displayed
beyond
the
garden
trees
and
the
wild
green
park
the
valley
of
gimmerton
with
a
long
line
of
mist
winding
nearly
to
its
top
for
very
soon
after
you
pass
the
chapel
as
you
may
have
noticed
the
sough
that
runs
from
the
marshes
joins
a
beck
which
follows
the
bend
of
the
glen
wuthering
heights
rose
above
this
silvery
vapour
but
our
old
house
was
invisible
it
rather
dips
down
on
the
other
side
both
the
room
and
its
occupants
and
the
scene
they
gazed
on
looked
wondrously
peaceful
i
shrank
reluctantly
from
performing
my
errand
and
was
actually
going
away
leaving
it
unsaid
after
having
put
my
question
about
the
candles
when
a
sense
of
my
folly
compelled
me
to
return
and
mutter
person
from
gimmerton
wishes
to
see
you
does
he
want
asked
linton
did
not
question
him
i
answered
close
the
curtains
nelly
she
said
bring
up
tea
i
be
back
again
directly
she
quitted
the
apartment
edgar
inquired
carelessly
who
it
was
one
mistress
does
not
expect
i
replied
heathcliff
you
recollect
him
sir
who
used
to
live
at
mr
earnshaw
the
gipsy
the
ploughboy
he
cried
did
you
not
say
so
to
catherine
you
must
not
call
him
by
those
names
master
i
said
be
sadly
grieved
to
hear
you
she
was
nearly
heartbroken
when
he
ran
off
i
guess
his
return
will
make
a
jubilee
to
her
linton
walked
to
a
window
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
that
overlooked
the
court
he
unfastened
it
and
leant
out
i
suppose
they
were
below
for
he
exclaimed
quickly
stand
there
love
bring
the
person
in
if
it
be
anyone
particular
ere
long
i
heard
the
click
of
the
latch
and
catherine
flew
breathless
and
wild
too
excited
to
show
gladness
indeed
by
her
face
you
would
rather
have
surmised
an
awful
calamity
edgar
edgar
she
panted
flinging
her
arms
round
his
neck
edgar
darling
heathcliff
come
back
he
is
and
she
tightened
her
embrace
to
a
squeeze
well
cried
her
husband
crossly
strangle
me
for
that
he
never
struck
me
as
such
a
marvellous
treasure
there
is
no
need
to
be
frantic
know
you
did
like
him
she
answered
repressing
a
little
the
intensity
of
her
delight
for
my
sake
you
must
be
friends
now
shall
i
tell
him
to
come
up
he
said
the
parlour
else
she
asked
he
looked
vexed
and
suggested
the
kitchen
as
a
more
suitable
place
for
him
linton
eyed
him
with
a
droll
expression
half
angry
half
laughing
at
his
fastidiousness
she
added
after
a
while
can
not
sit
in
the
kitchen
set
two
tables
here
ellen
one
for
your
master
and
miss
isabella
being
gentry
the
other
for
heathcliff
and
myself
being
of
the
lower
orders
will
that
please
you
dear
or
must
i
have
a
fire
lighted
elsewhere
if
so
give
directions
i
run
down
and
secure
my
guest
i
afraid
the
joy
is
too
great
to
be
real
she
was
about
to
dart
off
again
but
edgar
arrested
her
bid
him
step
up
he
said
addressing
me
catherine
try
to
be
glad
without
being
absurd
the
whole
household
need
not
witness
the
sight
of
your
welcoming
a
runaway
servant
as
a
brother
i
descended
and
found
heathcliff
waiting
under
the
porch
evidently
anticipating
an
invitation
to
enter
he
followed
my
guidance
without
waste
of
words
and
i
ushered
him
into
the
presence
of
the
master
and
mistress
whose
flushed
cheeks
betrayed
signs
of
warm
talking
but
the
lady
glowed
with
another
feeling
when
her
friend
appeared
at
the
door
she
sprang
forward
took
both
his
hands
and
led
him
to
linton
and
then
she
seized
linton
reluctant
fingers
and
crushed
them
into
his
now
fully
revealed
by
the
fire
and
candlelight
i
was
amazed
more
than
ever
to
behold
the
transformation
of
heathcliff
he
had
grown
a
tall
athletic
man
beside
whom
my
master
seemed
quite
slender
and
his
upright
carriage
suggested
the
idea
of
his
having
been
in
the
army
his
countenance
was
much
older
in
expression
and
decision
of
feature
than
linton
it
looked
intelligent
and
retained
no
marks
of
former
degradation
a
ferocity
lurked
yet
in
the
depressed
brows
and
eyes
full
of
black
fire
but
it
was
subdued
and
his
manner
was
even
dignified
quite
divested
of
roughness
though
stern
for
grace
my
master
surprise
equalled
or
exceeded
mine
he
remained
for
a
minute
at
a
loss
how
to
address
the
ploughboy
as
he
had
called
him
heathcliff
dropped
his
slight
hand
and
stood
looking
at
him
coolly
till
he
chose
to
speak
down
sir
he
said
at
length
linton
recalling
old
times
would
have
me
give
you
a
cordial
reception
and
of
course
i
am
gratified
when
anything
occurs
to
please
her
i
also
answered
heathcliff
if
it
be
anything
in
which
i
have
a
part
i
shall
stay
an
hour
or
two
willingly
he
took
a
seat
opposite
catherine
who
kept
her
gaze
fixed
on
him
as
if
she
feared
he
would
vanish
were
she
to
remove
it
he
did
not
raise
his
to
her
often
a
quick
glance
now
and
then
sufficed
but
it
flashed
back
each
time
more
confidently
the
undisguised
delight
he
drank
from
hers
they
were
too
much
absorbed
in
their
mutual
joy
to
suffer
embarrassment
not
so
edgar
he
grew
pale
with
pure
annoyance
a
feeling
that
reached
its
climax
when
his
lady
rose
and
stepping
across
the
rug
seized
heathcliff
hands
again
and
laughed
like
one
beside
herself
shall
think
it
a
dream
she
cried
shall
not
be
able
to
believe
that
i
have
seen
and
touched
and
spoken
to
you
once
more
and
yet
cruel
heathcliff
you
do
deserve
this
welcome
to
be
absent
and
silent
for
three
years
and
never
to
think
of
me
little
more
than
you
have
thought
of
me
he
murmured
heard
of
your
marriage
cathy
not
long
since
and
while
waiting
in
the
yard
below
i
meditated
this
plan
just
to
have
one
glimpse
of
your
face
a
stare
of
surprise
perhaps
and
pretended
pleasure
afterwards
settle
my
score
with
hindley
and
then
prevent
the
law
by
doing
execution
on
myself
your
welcome
has
put
these
ideas
out
of
my
mind
but
beware
of
meeting
me
with
another
aspect
next
time
nay
you
not
drive
me
off
again
you
were
really
sorry
for
me
were
you
well
there
was
cause
i
fought
through
a
bitter
life
since
i
last
heard
your
voice
and
you
must
forgive
me
for
i
struggled
only
for
you
unless
we
are
to
have
cold
tea
please
to
come
to
the
table
interrupted
linton
striving
to
preserve
his
ordinary
tone
and
a
due
measure
of
politeness
heathcliff
will
have
a
long
walk
wherever
he
may
lodge
and
i
thirsty
she
took
her
post
before
the
urn
and
miss
isabella
came
summoned
by
the
bell
then
having
handed
their
chairs
forward
i
left
the
room
the
meal
hardly
endured
ten
minutes
catherine
cup
was
never
filled
she
could
neither
eat
nor
drink
edgar
had
made
a
slop
in
his
saucer
and
scarcely
swallowed
a
mouthful
their
guest
did
not
protract
his
stay
that
evening
above
an
hour
longer
i
asked
as
he
departed
if
he
went
to
gimmerton
to
wuthering
heights
he
answered
earnshaw
invited
me
when
i
called
this
morning
earnshaw
invited
and
called
on
earnshaw
i
pondered
this
sentence
painfully
after
he
was
gone
is
he
turning
out
a
bit
of
a
hypocrite
and
coming
into
the
country
to
work
mischief
under
a
cloak
i
mused
i
had
a
presentiment
in
the
bottom
of
my
heart
that
he
had
better
have
remained
away
about
the
middle
of
the
night
i
was
wakened
from
my
first
nap
by
linton
gliding
into
my
chamber
taking
a
seat
on
my
bedside
and
pulling
me
by
the
hair
to
rouse
me
can
not
rest
ellen
she
said
by
way
of
apology
i
want
some
living
creature
to
keep
me
company
in
my
happiness
edgar
is
sulky
because
i
glad
of
a
thing
that
does
not
interest
him
he
refuses
to
open
his
mouth
except
to
utter
pettish
silly
speeches
and
he
affirmed
i
was
cruel
and
selfish
for
wishing
to
talk
when
he
was
so
sick
and
sleepy
he
always
contrives
to
be
sick
at
the
least
cross
i
gave
a
few
sentences
of
commendation
to
heathcliff
and
he
either
for
a
headache
or
a
pang
of
envy
began
to
cry
so
i
got
up
and
left
him
use
is
it
praising
heathcliff
to
him
i
answered
lads
they
had
an
aversion
to
each
other
and
heathcliff
would
hate
just
as
much
to
hear
him
praised
it
human
nature
let
linton
alone
about
him
unless
you
would
like
an
open
quarrel
between
them
does
it
not
show
great
weakness
pursued
she
not
envious
i
never
feel
hurt
at
the
brightness
of
isabella
yellow
hair
and
the
whiteness
of
her
skin
at
her
dainty
elegance
and
the
fondness
all
the
family
exhibit
for
her
even
you
nelly
if
we
have
a
dispute
sometimes
you
back
isabella
at
once
and
i
yield
like
a
foolish
mother
i
call
her
a
darling
and
flatter
her
into
a
good
temper
it
pleases
her
brother
to
see
us
cordial
and
that
pleases
me
but
they
are
very
much
alike
they
are
spoiled
children
and
fancy
the
world
was
made
for
their
accommodation
and
though
i
humour
both
i
think
a
smart
chastisement
might
improve
them
all
the
same
mistaken
linton
said
i
humour
you
i
know
what
there
would
be
to
do
if
they
did
not
you
can
well
afford
to
indulge
their
passing
whims
as
long
as
their
business
is
to
anticipate
all
your
desires
you
may
however
fall
out
at
last
over
something
of
equal
consequence
to
both
sides
and
then
those
you
term
weak
are
very
capable
of
being
as
obstinate
as
you
then
we
shall
fight
to
the
death
we
nelly
she
returned
laughing
i
tell
you
i
have
such
faith
in
linton
love
that
i
believe
i
might
kill
him
and
he
would
wish
to
retaliate
i
advised
her
to
value
him
the
more
for
his
affection
do
she
answered
he
need
resort
to
whining
for
trifles
it
is
childish
and
instead
of
melting
into
tears
because
i
said
that
heathcliff
was
now
worthy
of
anyone
regard
and
it
would
honour
the
first
gentleman
in
the
country
to
be
his
friend
he
ought
to
have
said
it
for
me
and
been
delighted
from
sympathy
he
must
get
accustomed
to
him
and
he
may
as
well
like
him
considering
how
heathcliff
has
reason
to
object
to
him
i
sure
he
behaved
excellently
do
you
think
of
his
going
to
wuthering
heights
i
inquired
is
reformed
in
every
respect
apparently
quite
a
christian
offering
the
right
hand
of
fellowship
to
his
enemies
all
around
explained
it
she
replied
wonder
as
much
as
you
he
said
he
called
to
gather
information
concerning
me
from
you
supposing
you
resided
there
still
and
joseph
told
hindley
who
came
out
and
fell
to
questioning
him
of
what
he
had
been
doing
and
how
he
had
been
living
and
finally
desired
him
to
walk
in
there
were
some
persons
sitting
at
cards
heathcliff
joined
them
my
brother
lost
some
money
to
him
and
finding
him
plentifully
supplied
he
requested
that
he
would
come
again
in
the
evening
to
which
he
consented
hindley
is
too
reckless
to
select
his
acquaintance
prudently
he
does
trouble
himself
to
reflect
on
the
causes
he
might
have
for
mistrusting
one
whom
he
has
basely
injured
but
heathcliff
affirms
his
principal
reason
for
resuming
a
connection
with
his
ancient
persecutor
is
a
wish
to
install
himself
in
quarters
at
walking
distance
from
the
grange
and
an
attachment
to
the
house
where
we
lived
together
and
likewise
a
hope
that
i
shall
have
more
opportunities
of
seeing
him
there
than
i
could
have
if
he
settled
in
gimmerton
he
means
to
offer
liberal
payment
for
permission
to
lodge
at
the
heights
and
doubtless
my
brother
covetousness
will
prompt
him
to
accept
the
terms
he
was
always
greedy
though
what
he
grasps
with
one
hand
he
flings
away
with
the
other
a
nice
place
for
a
young
man
to
fix
his
dwelling
in
said
i
you
no
fear
of
the
consequences
mrs
linton
for
my
friend
she
replied
strong
head
will
keep
him
from
danger
a
little
for
hindley
but
he
ca
be
made
morally
worse
than
he
is
and
i
stand
between
him
and
bodily
harm
the
event
of
this
evening
has
reconciled
me
to
god
and
humanity
i
had
risen
in
angry
rebellion
against
providence
oh
i
endured
very
very
bitter
misery
nelly
if
that
creature
knew
how
bitter
he
be
ashamed
to
cloud
its
removal
with
idle
petulance
it
was
kindness
for
him
which
induced
me
to
bear
it
alone
had
i
expressed
the
agony
i
frequently
felt
he
would
have
been
taught
to
long
for
its
alleviation
as
ardently
as
i
however
it
over
and
i
take
no
revenge
on
his
folly
i
can
afford
to
suffer
anything
hereafter
should
the
meanest
thing
alive
slap
me
on
the
cheek
i
not
only
turn
the
other
but
i
ask
pardon
for
provoking
it
and
as
a
proof
i
go
make
my
peace
with
edgar
instantly
i
an
angel
in
this
conviction
she
departed
and
the
success
of
her
fulfilled
resolution
was
obvious
on
the
morrow
linton
had
not
only
abjured
his
peevishness
though
his
spirits
seemed
still
subdued
by
catherine
exuberance
of
vivacity
but
he
ventured
no
objection
to
her
taking
isabella
with
her
to
wuthering
heights
in
the
afternoon
and
she
rewarded
him
with
such
a
summer
of
sweetness
and
affection
in
return
as
made
the
house
a
paradise
for
several
days
both
master
and
servants
profiting
from
the
perpetual
sunshine
heathcliff
heathcliff
i
should
say
in
future
used
the
liberty
of
visiting
at
thrushcross
grange
cautiously
at
first
he
seemed
estimating
how
far
its
owner
would
bear
his
intrusion
catherine
also
deemed
it
judicious
to
moderate
her
expressions
of
pleasure
in
receiving
him
and
he
gradually
established
his
right
to
be
expected
he
retained
a
great
deal
of
the
reserve
for
which
his
boyhood
was
remarkable
and
that
served
to
repress
all
startling
demonstrations
of
feeling
my
uneasiness
experienced
a
lull
and
further
circumstances
diverted
it
into
another
channel
for
a
space
his
new
source
of
trouble
sprang
from
the
not
anticipated
misfortune
of
isabella
linton
evincing
a
sudden
and
irresistible
attraction
towards
the
tolerated
guest
she
was
at
that
time
a
charming
young
lady
of
eighteen
infantile
in
manners
though
possessed
of
keen
wit
keen
feelings
and
a
keen
temper
too
if
irritated
her
brother
who
loved
her
tenderly
was
appalled
at
this
fantastic
preference
leaving
aside
the
degradation
of
an
alliance
with
a
nameless
man
and
the
possible
fact
that
his
property
in
default
of
heirs
male
might
pass
into
such
a
one
power
he
had
sense
to
comprehend
heathcliff
disposition
to
know
that
though
his
exterior
was
altered
his
mind
was
unchangeable
and
unchanged
and
he
dreaded
that
mind
it
revolted
him
he
shrank
forebodingly
from
the
idea
of
committing
isabella
to
its
keeping
he
would
have
recoiled
still
more
had
he
been
aware
that
her
attachment
rose
unsolicited
and
was
bestowed
where
it
awakened
no
reciprocation
of
sentiment
for
the
minute
he
discovered
its
existence
he
laid
the
blame
on
heathcliff
deliberate
designing
we
had
all
remarked
during
some
time
that
miss
linton
fretted
and
pined
over
something
she
grew
cross
and
wearisome
snapping
at
and
teasing
catherine
continually
at
the
imminent
risk
of
exhausting
her
limited
patience
we
excused
her
to
a
certain
extent
on
the
plea
of
she
was
dwindling
and
fading
before
our
eyes
but
one
day
when
she
had
been
peculiarly
wayward
rejecting
her
breakfast
complaining
that
the
servants
did
not
do
what
she
told
them
that
the
mistress
would
allow
her
to
be
nothing
in
the
house
and
edgar
neglected
her
that
she
had
caught
a
cold
with
the
doors
being
left
open
and
we
let
the
parlour
fire
go
out
on
purpose
to
vex
her
with
a
hundred
yet
more
frivolous
accusations
linton
peremptorily
insisted
that
she
should
get
to
bed
and
having
scolded
her
heartily
threatened
to
send
for
the
doctor
mention
of
kenneth
caused
her
to
exclaim
instantly
that
her
health
was
perfect
and
it
was
only
catherine
harshness
which
made
her
unhappy
can
you
say
i
am
harsh
you
naughty
fondling
cried
the
mistress
amazed
at
the
unreasonable
assertion
are
surely
losing
your
reason
when
have
i
been
harsh
tell
me
sobbed
isabella
now
said
her
what
occasion
our
walk
along
the
moor
you
told
me
to
ramble
where
i
pleased
while
you
sauntered
on
with
mr
heathcliff
that
your
notion
of
harshness
said
catherine
laughing
was
no
hint
that
your
company
was
superfluous
we
did
care
whether
you
kept
with
us
or
not
i
merely
thought
heathcliff
talk
would
have
nothing
entertaining
for
your
ears
no
wept
the
young
lady
wished
me
away
because
you
knew
i
liked
to
be
there
she
sane
asked
linton
appealing
to
me
repeat
our
conversation
word
for
word
isabella
and
you
point
out
any
charm
it
could
have
had
for
you
do
mind
the
conversation
she
answered
wanted
to
be
with
said
catherine
perceiving
her
hesitate
to
complete
the
sentence
him
and
i
wo
be
always
sent
off
she
continued
kindling
up
are
a
dog
in
the
manger
cathy
and
desire
no
one
to
be
loved
but
yourself
are
an
impertinent
little
monkey
exclaimed
linton
in
surprise
i
not
believe
this
idiotcy
it
is
impossible
that
you
can
covet
the
admiration
of
heathcliff
that
you
consider
him
an
agreeable
person
i
hope
i
have
misunderstood
you
isabella
you
have
not
said
the
infatuated
girl
love
him
more
than
ever
you
loved
edgar
and
he
might
love
me
if
you
would
let
him
would
be
you
for
a
kingdom
then
catherine
declared
emphatically
and
she
seemed
to
speak
sincerely
help
me
to
convince
her
of
her
madness
tell
her
what
heathcliff
is
an
unreclaimed
creature
without
refinement
without
cultivation
an
arid
wilderness
of
furze
and
whinstone
i
as
soon
put
that
little
canary
into
the
park
on
a
winter
day
as
recommend
you
to
bestow
your
heart
on
him
it
is
deplorable
ignorance
of
his
character
child
and
nothing
else
which
makes
that
dream
enter
your
head
pray
do
imagine
that
he
conceals
depths
of
benevolence
and
affection
beneath
a
stern
exterior
he
not
a
rough
diamond
a
oyster
of
a
rustic
he
a
fierce
pitiless
wolfish
man
i
never
say
to
him
let
this
or
that
enemy
alone
because
it
would
be
ungenerous
or
cruel
to
harm
them
i
say
let
them
alone
because
should
hate
them
to
be
wronged
and
he
crush
you
like
a
sparrow
egg
isabella
if
he
found
you
a
troublesome
charge
i
know
he
could
love
a
linton
and
yet
he
be
quite
capable
of
marrying
your
fortune
and
expectations
avarice
is
growing
with
him
a
besetting
sin
there
my
picture
and
i
his
friend
so
much
so
that
had
he
thought
seriously
to
catch
you
i
should
perhaps
have
held
my
tongue
and
let
you
fall
into
his
trap
miss
linton
regarded
her
with
indignation
shame
for
shame
she
repeated
angrily
are
worse
than
twenty
foes
you
poisonous
friend
you
wo
believe
me
then
said
catherine
think
i
speak
from
wicked
selfishness
certain
you
do
retorted
isabella
i
shudder
at
you
cried
the
other
for
yourself
if
that
be
your
spirit
i
have
done
and
yield
the
argument
to
your
saucy
insolence
i
must
suffer
for
her
egotism
she
sobbed
as
linton
left
the
room
all
is
against
me
she
has
blighted
my
single
consolation
but
she
uttered
falsehoods
did
she
heathcliff
is
not
a
fiend
he
has
an
honourable
soul
and
a
true
one
or
how
could
he
remember
her
him
from
your
thoughts
miss
i
said
a
bird
of
bad
omen
no
mate
for
you
linton
spoke
strongly
and
yet
i
ca
contradict
her
she
is
better
acquainted
with
his
heart
than
i
or
any
one
besides
and
she
never
would
represent
him
as
worse
than
he
is
honest
people
do
hide
their
deeds
how
has
he
been
living
how
has
he
got
rich
why
is
he
staying
at
wuthering
heights
the
house
of
a
man
whom
he
abhors
they
say
earnshaw

miss
linton
joseph
is
an
old
rascal
but
no
liar
and
if
his
account
of
heathcliff
conduct
be
true
you
would
never
think
of
desiring
such
a
husband
would
you
are
leagued
with
the
rest
ellen
she
replied
not
listen
to
your
slanders
what
malevolence
you
must
have
to
wish
to
convince
me
that
there
is
no
happiness
in
the
world
whether
she
would
have
got
over
this
fancy
if
left
to
herself
or
persevered
in
nursing
it
perpetually
i
can
not
say
she
had
little
time
to
reflect
the
day
after
there
was
a
at
the
next
town
my
master
was
obliged
to
attend
and
heathcliff
aware
of
his
absence
called
rather
earlier
than
usual
catherine
and
isabella
were
sitting
in
the
library
on
hostile
terms
but
silent
the
latter
alarmed
at
her
recent
indiscretion
and
the
disclosure
she
had
made
of
her
secret
feelings
in
a
transient
fit
of
passion
the
former
on
mature
consideration
really
offended
with
her
companion
and
if
she
laughed
again
at
her
pertness
inclined
to
make
it
no
laughing
matter
to
her
she
did
laugh
as
she
saw
heathcliff
pass
the
window
i
was
sweeping
the
hearth
and
i
noticed
a
mischievous
smile
on
her
lips
isabella
absorbed
in
her
meditations
or
a
book
remained
till
the
door
opened
and
it
was
too
late
to
attempt
an
escape
which
she
would
gladly
have
done
had
it
been
practicable
in
that
right
exclaimed
the
mistress
gaily
pulling
a
chair
to
the
fire
are
two
people
sadly
in
need
of
a
third
to
thaw
the
ice
between
them
and
you
are
the
very
one
we
should
both
of
us
choose
heathcliff
i
proud
to
show
you
at
last
somebody
that
dotes
on
you
more
than
myself
i
expect
you
to
feel
flattered
nay
it
not
nelly
do
look
at
her
my
poor
little
is
breaking
her
heart
by
mere
contemplation
of
your
physical
and
moral
beauty
it
lies
in
your
own
power
to
be
edgar
brother
no
no
isabella
you
run
off
she
continued
arresting
with
feigned
playfulness
the
confounded
girl
who
had
risen
indignantly
were
quarrelling
like
cats
about
you
heathcliff
and
i
was
fairly
beaten
in
protestations
of
devotion
and
admiration
and
moreover
i
was
informed
that
if
i
would
but
have
the
manners
to
stand
aside
my
rival
as
she
will
have
herself
to
be
would
shoot
a
shaft
into
your
soul
that
would
fix
you
for
ever
and
send
my
image
into
eternal
oblivion
said
isabella
calling
up
her
dignity
and
disdaining
to
struggle
from
the
tight
grasp
that
held
her
thank
you
to
adhere
to
the
truth
and
not
slander
me
even
in
joke
heathcliff
be
kind
enough
to
bid
this
friend
of
yours
release
me
she
forgets
that
you
and
i
are
not
intimate
acquaintances
and
what
amuses
her
is
painful
to
me
beyond
expression
as
the
guest
answered
nothing
but
took
his
seat
and
looked
thoroughly
indifferent
what
sentiments
she
cherished
concerning
him
she
turned
and
whispered
an
earnest
appeal
for
liberty
to
her
tormentor
no
means
cried
linton
in
answer
wo
be
named
a
dog
in
the
manger
again
you
stay
now
then
heathcliff
why
do
you
evince
satisfaction
at
my
pleasant
news
isabella
swears
that
the
love
edgar
has
for
me
is
nothing
to
that
she
entertains
for
you
i
sure
she
made
some
speech
of
the
kind
did
she
not
ellen
and
she
has
fasted
ever
since
the
day
before
yesterday
walk
from
sorrow
and
rage
that
i
despatched
her
out
of
your
society
under
the
idea
of
its
being
unacceptable
think
you
belie
her
said
heathcliff
twisting
his
chair
to
face
them
wishes
to
be
out
of
my
society
now
at
any
rate
and
he
stared
hard
at
the
object
of
discourse
as
one
might
do
at
a
strange
repulsive
animal
a
centipede
from
the
indies
for
instance
which
curiosity
leads
one
to
examine
in
spite
of
the
aversion
it
raises
the
poor
thing
could
bear
that
she
grew
white
and
red
in
rapid
succession
and
while
tears
beaded
her
lashes
bent
the
strength
of
her
small
fingers
to
loosen
the
firm
clutch
of
catherine
and
perceiving
that
as
fast
as
she
raised
one
finger
off
her
arm
another
closed
down
and
she
could
not
remove
the
whole
together
she
began
to
make
use
of
her
nails
and
their
sharpness
presently
ornamented
the
detainer
with
crescents
of
red
a
tigress
exclaimed
linton
setting
her
free
and
shaking
her
hand
with
pain
for
god
sake
and
hide
your
vixen
face
how
foolish
to
reveal
those
talons
to
him
ca
you
fancy
the
conclusions
he
draw
look
heathcliff
they
are
instruments
that
will
do
execution
you
must
beware
of
your
eyes
wrench
them
off
her
fingers
if
they
ever
menaced
me
he
answered
brutally
when
the
door
had
closed
after
her
what
did
you
mean
by
teasing
the
creature
in
that
manner
cathy
you
were
not
speaking
the
truth
were
you
assure
you
i
was
she
returned
has
been
dying
for
your
sake
several
weeks
and
raving
about
you
this
morning
and
pouring
forth
a
deluge
of
abuse
because
i
represented
your
failings
in
a
plain
light
for
the
purpose
of
mitigating
her
adoration
but
do
notice
it
further
i
wished
to
punish
her
sauciness
that
all
i
like
her
too
well
my
dear
heathcliff
to
let
you
absolutely
seize
and
devour
her
up
i
like
her
too
ill
to
attempt
it
said
he
in
a
very
ghoulish
fashion
you
hear
of
odd
things
if
i
lived
alone
with
that
mawkish
waxen
face
the
most
ordinary
would
be
painting
on
its
white
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
and
turning
the
blue
eyes
black
every
day
or
two
they
detestably
resemble
linton
observed
catherine
are
dove
eyes
angel
her
brother
heir
is
she
not
he
asked
after
a
brief
silence
should
be
sorry
to
think
so
returned
his
companion
a
dozen
nephews
shall
erase
her
title
please
heaven
abstract
your
mind
from
the
subject
at
present
you
are
too
prone
to
covet
your
goods
remember
neighbour
goods
are
mine
they
were
they
would
be
none
the
less
that
said
heathcliff
though
isabella
linton
may
be
silly
she
is
scarcely
mad
and
in
short
we
dismiss
the
matter
as
you
advise
from
their
tongues
they
did
dismiss
it
and
catherine
probably
from
her
thoughts
the
other
i
felt
certain
recalled
it
often
in
the
course
of
the
evening
i
saw
him
smile
to
himself
grin
rather
and
lapse
into
ominous
musing
whenever
linton
had
occasion
to
be
absent
from
the
apartment
i
determined
to
watch
his
movements
my
heart
invariably
cleaved
to
the
master
in
preference
to
catherine
side
with
reason
i
imagined
for
he
was
kind
and
trustful
and
honourable
and
she
she
could
not
be
called
yet
she
seemed
to
allow
herself
such
wide
latitude
that
i
had
little
faith
in
her
principles
and
still
less
sympathy
for
her
feelings
i
wanted
something
to
happen
which
might
have
the
effect
of
freeing
both
wuthering
heights
and
the
grange
of
heathcliff
quietly
leaving
us
as
we
had
been
prior
to
his
advent
his
visits
were
a
continual
nightmare
to
me
and
i
suspected
to
my
master
also
his
abode
at
the
heights
was
an
oppression
past
explaining
i
felt
that
god
had
forsaken
the
stray
sheep
there
to
its
own
wicked
wanderings
and
an
evil
beast
prowled
between
it
and
the
fold
waiting
his
time
to
spring
and
destroy
chapter
xi
sometimes
while
meditating
on
these
things
in
solitude
i
got
up
in
a
sudden
terror
and
put
on
my
bonnet
to
go
see
how
all
was
at
the
farm
i
persuaded
my
conscience
that
it
was
a
duty
to
warn
him
how
people
talked
regarding
his
ways
and
then
i
recollected
his
confirmed
bad
habits
and
hopeless
of
benefiting
him
have
flinched
from
the
dismal
house
doubting
if
i
could
bear
to
be
taken
at
my
word
one
time
i
passed
the
old
gate
going
out
of
my
way
on
a
journey
to
gimmerton
it
was
about
the
period
that
my
narrative
has
reached
a
bright
frosty
afternoon
the
ground
bare
and
the
road
hard
and
dry
i
came
to
a
stone
where
the
highway
branches
off
on
to
the
moor
at
your
left
hand
a
rough
with
the
letters
cut
on
its
north
side
on
the
east
and
on
the
it
serves
as
a
to
the
grange
the
heights
and
village
the
sun
shone
yellow
on
its
grey
head
reminding
me
of
summer
and
i
can
not
say
why
but
all
at
once
a
gush
of
child
sensations
flowed
into
my
heart
hindley
and
i
held
it
a
favourite
spot
twenty
years
before
i
gazed
long
at
the
block
and
stooping
down
perceived
a
hole
near
the
bottom
still
full
of
and
pebbles
which
we
were
fond
of
storing
there
with
more
perishable
things
and
as
fresh
as
reality
it
appeared
that
i
beheld
my
early
playmate
seated
on
the
withered
turf
his
dark
square
head
bent
forward
and
his
little
hand
scooping
out
the
earth
with
a
piece
of
slate
hindley
i
exclaimed
involuntarily
i
started
my
bodily
eye
was
cheated
into
a
momentary
belief
that
the
child
lifted
its
face
and
stared
straight
into
mine
it
vanished
in
a
twinkling
but
immediately
i
felt
an
irresistible
yearning
to
be
at
the
heights
superstition
urged
me
to
comply
with
this
impulse
supposing
he
should
be
dead
i
thought
or
should
die
soon
supposing
it
were
a
sign
of
death
the
nearer
i
got
to
the
house
the
more
agitated
i
grew
and
on
catching
sight
of
it
i
trembled
in
every
limb
the
apparition
had
outstripped
me
it
stood
looking
through
the
gate
that
was
my
first
idea
on
observing
an
boy
setting
his
ruddy
countenance
against
the
bars
further
reflection
suggested
this
must
be
hareton
hareton
not
altered
greatly
since
i
left
him
ten
months
since
bless
thee
darling
i
cried
forgetting
instantaneously
my
foolish
fears
it
nelly
nelly
thy
nurse
he
retreated
out
of
arm
length
and
picked
up
a
large
flint
am
come
to
see
thy
father
hareton
i
added
guessing
from
the
action
that
nelly
if
she
lived
in
his
memory
at
all
was
not
recognised
as
one
with
me
he
raised
his
missile
to
hurl
it
i
commenced
a
soothing
speech
but
could
not
stay
his
hand
the
stone
struck
my
bonnet
and
then
ensued
from
the
stammering
lips
of
the
little
fellow
a
string
of
curses
which
whether
he
comprehended
them
or
not
were
delivered
with
practised
emphasis
and
distorted
his
baby
features
into
a
shocking
expression
of
malignity
you
may
be
certain
this
grieved
more
than
angered
me
fit
to
cry
i
took
an
orange
from
my
pocket
and
offered
it
to
propitiate
him
he
hesitated
and
then
snatched
it
from
my
hold
as
if
he
fancied
i
only
intended
to
tempt
and
disappoint
him
i
showed
another
keeping
it
out
of
his
reach
has
taught
you
those
fine
words
my
bairn
i
inquired
curate
the
curate
and
thee
gie
me
that
he
replied
us
where
you
got
your
lessons
and
you
shall
have
it
said
i
your
master
daddy
was
his
answer
what
do
you
learn
from
daddy
i
continued
he
jumped
at
the
fruit
i
raised
it
higher
does
he
teach
you
i
asked
said
he
to
keep
out
of
his
gait
daddy
can
not
bide
me
because
i
swear
at
him
and
the
devil
teaches
you
to
swear
at
daddy
i
observed
nay
he
drawled
then
asked
if
he
liked
mr
heathcliff
he
answered
again
desiring
to
have
his
reasons
for
liking
him
i
could
only
gather
the
sentences
know
he
pays
dad
back
what
he
gies
to
me
he
curses
daddy
for
cursing
me
he
says
i
mun
do
as
i
will
the
curate
does
not
teach
you
to
read
and
write
then
i
pursued
i
was
told
the
curate
should
have
his
teeth
dashed
down
his
throat
if
he
stepped
over
the
threshold
heathcliff
had
promised
that
i
put
the
orange
in
his
hand
and
bade
him
tell
his
father
that
a
woman
called
nelly
dean
was
waiting
to
speak
with
him
by
the
garden
gate
he
went
up
the
walk
and
entered
the
house
but
instead
of
hindley
heathcliff
appeared
on
the
and
i
turned
directly
and
ran
down
the
road
as
hard
as
ever
i
could
race
making
no
halt
till
i
gained
the
and
feeling
as
scared
as
if
i
had
raised
a
goblin
this
is
not
much
connected
with
miss
isabella
affair
except
that
it
urged
me
to
resolve
further
on
mounting
vigilant
guard
and
doing
my
utmost
to
check
the
spread
of
such
bad
influence
at
the
grange
even
though
i
should
wake
a
domestic
storm
by
thwarting
linton
pleasure
the
next
time
heathcliff
came
my
young
lady
chanced
to
be
feeding
some
pigeons
in
the
court
she
had
never
spoken
a
word
to
her
for
three
days
but
she
had
likewise
dropped
her
fretful
complaining
and
we
found
it
a
great
comfort
heathcliff
had
not
the
habit
of
bestowing
a
single
unnecessary
civility
on
miss
linton
i
knew
now
as
soon
as
he
beheld
her
his
first
precaution
was
to
take
a
sweeping
survey
of
the
i
was
standing
by
the
but
i
drew
out
of
sight
he
then
stepped
across
the
pavement
to
her
and
said
something
she
seemed
embarrassed
and
desirous
of
getting
away
to
prevent
it
he
laid
his
hand
on
her
arm
she
averted
her
face
he
apparently
put
some
question
which
she
had
no
mind
to
answer
there
was
another
rapid
glance
at
the
house
and
supposing
himself
unseen
the
scoundrel
had
the
impudence
to
embrace
her
traitor
i
ejaculated
are
a
hypocrite
too
are
you
a
deliberate
deceiver
is
nelly
said
catherine
voice
at
my
elbow
i
had
been
on
watching
the
pair
outside
to
mark
her
entrance
worthless
friend
i
answered
warmly
sneaking
rascal
yonder
ah
he
has
caught
a
glimpse
of
us
he
is
coming
in
i
wonder
will
he
have
the
heart
to
find
a
plausible
excuse
for
making
love
to
miss
when
he
told
you
he
hated
her
linton
saw
isabella
tear
herself
free
and
run
into
the
garden
and
a
minute
after
heathcliff
opened
the
door
i
could
withhold
giving
some
loose
to
my
indignation
but
catherine
angrily
insisted
on
silence
and
threatened
to
order
me
out
of
the
kitchen
if
i
dared
to
be
so
presumptuous
as
to
put
in
my
insolent
tongue
hear
you
people
might
think
you
were
the
mistress
she
cried
want
setting
down
in
your
right
place
heathcliff
what
are
you
about
raising
this
stir
i
said
you
must
let
isabella
alone
i
beg
you
will
unless
you
are
tired
of
being
received
here
and
wish
linton
to
draw
the
bolts
against
you
forbid
that
he
should
try
answered
the
black
villain
i
detested
him
just
then
keep
him
meek
and
patient
every
day
i
grow
madder
after
sending
him
to
heaven
said
catherine
shutting
the
inner
door
vex
me
why
have
you
disregarded
my
request
did
she
come
across
you
on
purpose
is
it
to
you
he
growled
have
a
right
to
kiss
her
if
she
chooses
and
you
have
no
right
to
object
i
am
not
husband
need
be
jealous
of
me
not
jealous
of
you
replied
the
mistress
jealous
for
you
clear
your
face
you
scowl
at
me
if
you
like
isabella
you
shall
marry
her
but
do
you
like
her
tell
the
truth
heathcliff
there
you
wo
answer
i
certain
you
do
would
linton
approve
of
his
sister
marrying
that
man
i
inquired
linton
should
approve
returned
my
lady
decisively
might
spare
himself
the
trouble
said
heathcliff
could
do
as
well
without
his
approbation
and
as
to
you
catherine
i
have
a
mind
to
speak
a
few
words
now
while
we
are
at
it
i
want
you
to
be
aware
that
i
you
have
treated
me
infernally
infernally
do
you
hear
and
if
you
flatter
yourself
that
i
do
perceive
it
you
are
a
fool
and
if
you
think
i
can
be
consoled
by
sweet
words
you
are
an
idiot
and
if
you
fancy
i
suffer
unrevenged
i
convince
you
of
the
contrary
in
a
very
little
while
meantime
thank
you
for
telling
me
your
secret
i
swear
i
make
the
most
of
it
and
stand
you
aside
new
phase
of
his
character
is
this
exclaimed
linton
in
amazement
treated
you
infernally
and
you
take
your
revenge
how
will
you
take
it
ungrateful
brute
how
have
i
treated
you
infernally
seek
no
revenge
on
you
replied
heathcliff
less
vehemently
not
the
plan
the
tyrant
grinds
down
his
slaves
and
they
do
turn
against
him
they
crush
those
beneath
them
you
are
welcome
to
torture
me
to
death
for
your
amusement
only
allow
me
to
amuse
myself
a
little
in
the
same
style
and
refrain
from
insult
as
much
as
you
are
able
having
levelled
my
palace
do
erect
a
hovel
and
complacently
admire
your
own
charity
in
giving
me
that
for
a
home
if
i
imagined
you
really
wished
me
to
marry
isabel
i
cut
my
throat
the
evil
is
that
i
am
jealous
is
it
cried
catherine
i
wo
repeat
my
offer
of
a
wife
it
is
as
bad
as
offering
satan
a
lost
soul
your
bliss
lies
like
his
in
inflicting
misery
you
prove
it
edgar
is
restored
from
the
he
gave
way
to
at
your
coming
i
begin
to
be
secure
and
tranquil
and
you
restless
to
know
us
at
peace
appear
resolved
on
exciting
a
quarrel
quarrel
with
edgar
if
you
please
heathcliff
and
deceive
his
sister
you
hit
on
exactly
the
most
efficient
method
of
revenging
yourself
on
me
the
conversation
ceased
linton
sat
down
by
the
fire
flushed
and
gloomy
the
spirit
which
served
her
was
growing
intractable
she
could
neither
lay
nor
control
it
he
stood
on
the
hearth
with
folded
arms
brooding
on
his
evil
thoughts
and
in
this
position
i
left
them
to
seek
the
master
who
was
wondering
what
kept
catherine
below
so
long
said
he
when
i
entered
you
seen
your
mistress
she
in
the
kitchen
sir
i
answered
sadly
put
out
by
heathcliff
behaviour
and
indeed
i
do
think
it
time
to
arrange
his
visits
on
another
footing
there
harm
in
being
too
soft
and
now
it
come
to
this
and
i
related
the
scene
in
the
court
and
as
near
as
i
dared
the
whole
subsequent
dispute
i
fancied
it
could
not
be
very
prejudicial
to
linton
unless
she
made
it
so
afterwards
by
assuming
the
defensive
for
her
guest
edgar
linton
had
difficulty
in
hearing
me
to
the
close
his
first
words
revealed
that
he
did
not
clear
his
wife
of
blame
is
insufferable
he
exclaimed
is
disgraceful
that
she
should
own
him
for
a
friend
and
force
his
company
on
me
call
me
two
men
out
of
the
hall
ellen
catherine
shall
linger
no
longer
to
argue
with
the
low
ruffian
i
have
humoured
her
enough
he
descended
and
bidding
the
servants
wait
in
the
passage
went
followed
by
me
to
the
kitchen
its
occupants
had
recommenced
their
angry
discussion
linton
at
least
was
scolding
with
renewed
vigour
heathcliff
had
moved
to
the
window
and
hung
his
head
somewhat
cowed
by
her
violent
rating
apparently
he
saw
the
master
first
and
made
a
hasty
motion
that
she
should
be
silent
which
she
obeyed
abruptly
on
discovering
the
reason
of
his
intimation
is
this
said
linton
addressing
her
notion
of
propriety
must
you
have
to
remain
here
after
the
language
which
has
been
held
to
you
by
that
blackguard
i
suppose
because
it
is
his
ordinary
talk
you
think
nothing
of
it
you
are
habituated
to
his
baseness
and
perhaps
imagine
i
can
get
used
to
it
too
you
been
listening
at
the
door
edgar
asked
the
mistress
in
a
tone
particularly
calculated
to
provoke
her
husband
implying
both
carelessness
and
contempt
of
his
irritation
heathcliff
who
had
raised
his
eyes
at
the
former
speech
gave
a
sneering
laugh
at
the
latter
on
purpose
it
seemed
to
draw
linton
attention
to
him
he
succeeded
but
edgar
did
not
mean
to
entertain
him
with
any
high
flights
of
passion
been
so
far
forbearing
with
you
sir
he
said
quietly
that
i
was
ignorant
of
your
miserable
degraded
character
but
i
felt
you
were
only
partly
responsible
for
that
and
catherine
wishing
to
keep
up
your
acquaintance
i
acquiesced
foolishly
your
presence
is
a
moral
poison
that
would
contaminate
the
most
virtuous
for
that
cause
and
to
prevent
worse
consequences
i
shall
deny
you
hereafter
admission
into
this
house
and
give
notice
now
that
i
require
your
instant
departure
three
minutes
delay
will
render
it
involuntary
and
ignominious
heathcliff
measured
the
height
and
breadth
of
the
speaker
with
an
eye
full
of
derision
this
lamb
of
yours
threatens
like
a
bull
he
said
is
in
danger
of
splitting
its
skull
against
my
knuckles
by
god
linton
i
mortally
sorry
that
you
are
not
worth
knocking
down
my
master
glanced
towards
the
passage
and
signed
me
to
fetch
the
men
he
had
no
intention
of
hazarding
a
personal
encounter
i
obeyed
the
hint
but
linton
suspecting
something
followed
and
when
i
attempted
to
call
them
she
pulled
me
back
slammed
the
door
to
and
locked
it
means
she
said
in
answer
to
her
husband
look
of
angry
surprise
you
have
not
courage
to
attack
him
make
an
apology
or
allow
yourself
to
be
beaten
it
will
correct
you
of
feigning
more
valour
than
you
possess
no
i
swallow
the
key
before
you
shall
get
it
delightfully
rewarded
for
my
kindness
to
each
after
constant
indulgence
of
one
weak
nature
and
the
other
bad
one
i
earn
for
thanks
two
samples
of
blind
ingratitude
stupid
to
absurdity
edgar
i
was
defending
you
and
yours
and
i
wish
heathcliff
may
flog
you
sick
for
daring
to
think
an
evil
thought
of
me
it
did
not
need
the
medium
of
a
flogging
to
produce
that
effect
on
the
master
he
tried
to
wrest
the
key
from
catherine
grasp
and
for
safety
she
flung
it
into
the
hottest
part
of
the
fire
whereupon
edgar
was
taken
with
a
nervous
trembling
and
his
countenance
grew
deadly
pale
for
his
life
he
could
not
avert
that
excess
of
emotion
mingled
anguish
and
humiliation
overcame
him
completely
he
leant
on
the
back
of
a
chair
and
covered
his
face
heavens
in
old
days
this
would
win
you
knighthood
exclaimed
linton
are
vanquished
we
are
vanquished
heathcliff
would
as
soon
lift
a
finger
at
you
as
the
king
would
march
his
army
against
a
colony
of
mice
cheer
up
you
be
hurt
your
type
is
not
a
lamb
it
a
sucking
leveret
wish
you
joy
of
the
coward
cathy
said
her
friend
compliment
you
on
your
taste
and
that
is
the
slavering
shivering
thing
you
preferred
to
me
i
would
not
strike
him
with
my
fist
but
i
kick
him
with
my
foot
and
experience
considerable
satisfaction
is
he
weeping
or
is
he
going
to
faint
for
fear
the
fellow
approached
and
gave
the
chair
on
which
linton
rested
a
push
he
better
have
kept
his
distance
my
master
quickly
sprang
erect
and
struck
him
full
on
the
throat
a
blow
that
would
have
levelled
a
slighter
man
it
took
his
breath
for
a
minute
and
while
he
choked
linton
walked
out
by
the
back
door
into
the
yard
and
from
thence
to
the
front
entrance
you
done
with
coming
here
cried
catherine
away
now
he
return
with
a
brace
of
pistols
and
assistants
if
he
did
overhear
us
of
course
he
never
forgive
you
you
played
me
an
ill
turn
heathcliff
but
go
make
haste
i
rather
see
edgar
at
bay
than
you
you
suppose
i
going
with
that
blow
burning
in
my
gullet
he
thundered
hell
no
i
crush
his
ribs
in
like
a
rotten
before
i
cross
the
threshold
if
i
do
floor
him
now
i
shall
murder
him
some
time
so
as
you
value
his
existence
let
me
get
at
him
is
not
coming
i
interposed
framing
a
bit
of
a
lie
the
coachman
and
the
two
gardeners
you
surely
not
wait
to
be
thrust
into
the
road
by
them
each
has
a
bludgeon
and
master
will
very
likely
be
watching
from
the
to
see
that
they
fulfil
his
orders
the
gardeners
and
coachman
were
there
but
linton
was
with
them
they
had
already
entered
the
court
heathcliff
on
the
second
thoughts
resolved
to
avoid
a
struggle
against
three
underlings
he
seized
the
poker
smashed
the
lock
from
the
inner
door
and
made
his
escape
as
they
tramped
in
linton
who
was
very
much
excited
bade
me
accompany
her
she
did
not
know
my
share
in
contributing
to
the
disturbance
and
i
was
anxious
to
keep
her
in
ignorance
nearly
distracted
nelly
she
exclaimed
throwing
herself
on
the
sofa
thousand
smiths
hammers
are
beating
in
my
head
tell
isabella
to
shun
me
this
uproar
is
owing
to
her
and
should
she
or
any
one
else
aggravate
my
anger
at
present
i
shall
get
wild
and
nelly
say
to
edgar
if
you
see
him
again
that
i
in
danger
of
being
seriously
ill
i
wish
it
may
prove
true
he
has
startled
and
distressed
me
shockingly
i
want
to
frighten
him
besides
he
might
come
and
begin
a
string
of
abuse
or
complainings
i
certain
i
should
recriminate
and
god
knows
where
we
should
end
will
you
do
so
my
good
nelly
you
are
aware
that
i
am
no
way
blamable
in
this
matter
what
possessed
him
to
turn
listener
heathcliff
talk
was
outrageous
after
you
left
us
but
i
could
soon
have
diverted
him
from
isabella
and
the
rest
meant
nothing
now
all
is
dashed
wrong
by
the
fool
craving
to
hear
evil
of
self
that
haunts
some
people
like
a
demon
had
edgar
never
gathered
our
conversation
he
would
never
have
been
the
worse
for
it
really
when
he
opened
on
me
in
that
unreasonable
tone
of
displeasure
after
i
had
scolded
heathcliff
till
i
was
hoarse
for
him
i
did
not
care
hardly
what
they
did
to
each
other
especially
as
i
felt
that
however
the
scene
closed
we
should
all
be
driven
asunder
for
nobody
knows
how
long
well
if
i
can
not
keep
heathcliff
for
my
friend
if
edgar
will
be
mean
and
jealous
i
try
to
break
their
hearts
by
breaking
my
own
that
will
be
a
prompt
way
of
finishing
all
when
i
am
pushed
to
extremity
but
it
a
deed
to
be
reserved
for
a
forlorn
hope
i
not
take
linton
by
surprise
with
it
to
this
point
he
has
been
discreet
in
dreading
to
provoke
me
you
must
represent
the
peril
of
quitting
that
policy
and
remind
him
of
my
passionate
temper
verging
when
kindled
on
frenzy
i
wish
you
could
dismiss
that
apathy
out
of
that
countenance
and
look
rather
more
anxious
about
me
the
stolidity
with
which
i
received
these
instructions
was
no
doubt
rather
exasperating
for
they
were
delivered
in
perfect
sincerity
but
i
believed
a
person
who
could
plan
the
turning
of
her
fits
of
passion
to
account
beforehand
might
by
exerting
her
will
manage
to
control
herself
tolerably
even
while
under
their
influence
and
i
did
not
wish
to
her
husband
as
she
said
and
multiply
his
annoyances
for
the
purpose
of
serving
her
selfishness
therefore
i
said
nothing
when
i
met
the
master
coming
towards
the
parlour
but
i
took
the
liberty
of
turning
back
to
listen
whether
they
would
resume
their
quarrel
together
he
began
to
speak
first
where
you
are
catherine
he
said
without
any
anger
in
his
voice
but
with
much
sorrowful
despondency
shall
not
stay
i
am
neither
come
to
wrangle
nor
be
reconciled
but
i
wish
just
to
learn
whether
after
this
evening
events
you
intend
to
continue
your
intimacy
with
for
mercy
sake
interrupted
the
mistress
stamping
her
foot
mercy
sake
let
us
hear
no
more
of
it
now
your
cold
blood
can
not
be
worked
into
a
fever
your
veins
are
full
of
but
mine
are
boiling
and
the
sight
of
such
chillness
makes
them
dance
get
rid
of
me
answer
my
question
persevered
linton
must
answer
it
and
that
violence
does
not
alarm
me
i
have
found
that
you
can
be
as
stoical
as
anyone
when
you
please
will
you
give
up
heathcliff
hereafter
or
will
you
give
up
me
it
is
impossible
for
you
to
be
friend
and
at
the
same
time
and
i
absolutely
to
know
which
you
choose
require
to
be
let
alone
exclaimed
catherine
furiously
demand
it
do
you
see
i
can
scarcely
stand
edgar
you
you
leave
me
she
rang
the
bell
till
it
broke
with
a
twang
i
entered
leisurely
it
was
enough
to
try
the
temper
of
a
saint
such
senseless
wicked
rages
there
she
lay
dashing
her
head
against
the
arm
of
the
sofa
and
grinding
her
teeth
so
that
you
might
fancy
she
would
crash
them
to
splinters
linton
stood
looking
at
her
in
sudden
compunction
and
fear
he
told
me
to
fetch
some
water
she
had
no
breath
for
speaking
i
brought
a
glass
full
and
as
she
would
not
drink
i
sprinkled
it
on
her
face
in
a
few
seconds
she
stretched
herself
out
stiff
and
turned
up
her
eyes
while
her
cheeks
at
once
blanched
and
livid
assumed
the
aspect
of
death
linton
looked
terrified
is
nothing
in
the
world
the
matter
i
whispered
i
did
not
want
him
to
yield
though
i
could
not
help
being
afraid
in
my
heart
has
blood
on
her
lips
he
said
shuddering
mind
i
answered
tartly
and
i
told
him
how
she
had
resolved
previous
to
his
coming
on
exhibiting
a
fit
of
frenzy
i
incautiously
gave
the
account
aloud
and
she
heard
me
for
she
started
up
her
hair
flying
over
her
shoulders
her
eyes
flashing
the
muscles
of
her
neck
and
arms
standing
out
preternaturally
i
made
up
my
mind
for
broken
bones
at
least
but
she
only
glared
about
her
for
an
instant
and
then
rushed
from
the
room
the
master
directed
me
to
follow
i
did
to
her
she
hindered
me
from
going
further
by
securing
it
against
me
as
she
never
offered
to
descend
to
breakfast
next
morning
i
went
to
ask
whether
she
would
have
some
carried
up
she
replied
peremptorily
the
same
question
was
repeated
at
dinner
and
tea
and
again
on
the
morrow
after
and
received
the
same
answer
linton
on
his
part
spent
his
time
in
the
library
and
did
not
inquire
concerning
his
occupations
isabella
and
he
had
had
an
hour
interview
during
which
he
tried
to
elicit
from
her
some
sentiment
of
proper
horror
for
heathcliff
advances
but
he
could
make
nothing
of
her
evasive
replies
and
was
obliged
to
close
the
examination
unsatisfactorily
adding
however
a
solemn
warning
that
if
she
were
so
insane
as
to
encourage
that
worthless
suitor
it
would
dissolve
all
bonds
of
relationship
between
herself
and
him
chapter
xii
while
miss
linton
moped
about
the
park
and
garden
always
silent
and
almost
always
in
tears
and
her
brother
shut
himself
up
among
books
that
he
never
opened
wearying
i
guessed
with
a
continual
vague
expectation
that
catherine
repenting
her
conduct
would
come
of
her
own
accord
to
ask
pardon
and
seek
a
reconciliation
and
fasted
pertinaciously
under
the
idea
probably
that
at
every
meal
edgar
was
ready
to
choke
for
her
absence
and
pride
alone
held
him
from
running
to
cast
himself
at
her
feet
i
went
about
my
household
duties
convinced
that
the
grange
had
but
one
sensible
soul
in
its
walls
and
that
lodged
in
my
body
i
wasted
no
condolences
on
miss
nor
any
expostulations
on
my
mistress
nor
did
i
pay
much
attention
to
the
sighs
of
my
master
who
yearned
to
hear
his
name
since
he
might
not
hear
her
voice
i
determined
they
should
come
about
as
they
pleased
for
me
and
though
it
was
a
tiresomely
slow
process
i
began
to
rejoice
at
length
in
a
faint
dawn
of
its
progress
as
i
thought
at
first
linton
on
the
third
day
unbarred
her
door
and
having
finished
the
water
in
her
pitcher
and
decanter
desired
a
renewed
supply
and
a
basin
of
gruel
for
she
believed
she
was
dying
that
i
set
down
as
a
speech
meant
for
edgar
ears
i
believed
no
such
thing
so
i
kept
it
to
myself
and
brought
her
some
tea
and
dry
toast
she
ate
and
drank
eagerly
and
sank
back
on
her
pillow
again
clenching
her
hands
and
groaning
i
will
die
she
exclaimed
no
one
cares
anything
about
me
i
wish
i
had
not
taken
that
then
a
good
while
after
i
heard
her
murmur
i
not
die
he
be
glad
he
does
not
love
me
at
all
he
would
never
miss
me
you
want
anything
i
inquired
still
preserving
my
external
composure
in
spite
of
her
ghastly
countenance
and
strange
exaggerated
manner
is
that
apathetic
being
doing
she
demanded
pushing
the
thick
entangled
locks
from
her
wasted
face
he
fallen
into
a
lethargy
or
is
he
dead
replied
i
you
mean
linton
he
tolerably
well
i
think
though
his
studies
occupy
him
rather
more
than
they
ought
he
is
continually
among
his
books
since
he
has
no
other
society
i
should
not
have
spoken
so
if
i
had
known
her
true
condition
but
i
could
not
get
rid
of
the
notion
that
she
acted
a
part
of
her
disorder
his
books
she
cried
confounded
i
dying
i
on
the
brink
of
the
grave
my
god
does
he
know
how
i
altered
continued
she
staring
at
her
reflection
in
a
mirror
hanging
against
the
opposite
wall
that
catherine
linton
he
imagines
me
in
a
pet
in
play
perhaps
can
not
you
inform
him
that
it
is
frightful
earnest
nelly
if
it
be
not
too
late
as
soon
as
i
learn
how
he
feels
i
choose
between
these
two
either
to
starve
at
once
that
would
be
no
punishment
unless
he
had
a
heart
or
to
recover
and
leave
the
country
are
you
speaking
the
truth
about
him
now
take
care
is
he
actually
so
utterly
indifferent
for
my
life
i
answered
master
has
no
idea
of
your
being
deranged
and
of
course
he
does
not
fear
that
you
will
let
yourself
die
of
hunger
think
not
can
not
you
tell
him
i
will
she
returned
him
speak
of
your
own
mind
say
you
are
certain
i
will
you
forget
linton
i
suggested
you
have
eaten
some
food
with
a
relish
this
evening
and
you
will
perceive
its
good
effects
i
were
only
sure
it
would
kill
him
she
interrupted
kill
myself
directly
these
three
awful
nights
i
never
closed
my
lids
and
oh
i
been
tormented
i
been
haunted
nelly
but
i
begin
to
fancy
you
do
like
me
how
strange
i
thought
though
everybody
hated
and
despised
each
other
they
could
not
avoid
loving
me
and
they
have
all
turned
to
enemies
in
a
few
hours
they
have
i
positive
the
people
here
how
dreary
to
meet
death
surrounded
by
their
cold
faces
isabella
terrified
and
repelled
afraid
to
enter
the
room
it
would
be
so
dreadful
to
watch
catherine
go
and
edgar
standing
solemnly
by
to
see
it
over
then
offering
prayers
of
thanks
to
god
for
restoring
peace
to
his
house
and
going
back
to
his
what
in
the
name
of
all
that
feels
has
he
to
do
with
when
i
am
dying
she
could
not
bear
the
notion
which
i
had
put
into
her
head
of
linton
philosophical
resignation
tossing
about
she
increased
her
feverish
bewilderment
to
madness
and
tore
the
pillow
with
her
teeth
then
raising
herself
up
all
burning
desired
that
i
would
open
the
window
we
were
in
the
middle
of
winter
the
wind
blew
strong
from
the
and
i
objected
both
the
expressions
flitting
over
her
face
and
the
changes
of
her
moods
began
to
alarm
me
terribly
and
brought
to
my
recollection
her
former
illness
and
the
doctor
injunction
that
she
should
not
be
crossed
a
minute
previously
she
was
violent
now
supported
on
one
arm
and
not
noticing
my
refusal
to
obey
her
she
seemed
to
find
childish
diversion
in
pulling
the
feathers
from
the
rents
she
had
just
made
and
ranging
them
on
the
sheet
according
to
their
different
species
her
mind
had
strayed
to
other
associations
a
turkey
she
murmured
to
herself
this
is
a
wild
duck
and
this
is
a
pigeon
ah
they
put
pigeons
feathers
in
the
pillows
no
wonder
i
could
die
let
me
take
care
to
throw
it
on
the
floor
when
i
lie
down
and
here
is
a
and
this
i
should
know
it
among
a
thousand
it
a
lapwing
bonny
bird
wheeling
over
our
heads
in
the
middle
of
the
moor
it
wanted
to
get
to
its
nest
for
the
clouds
had
touched
the
swells
and
it
felt
rain
coming
this
feather
was
picked
up
from
the
heath
the
bird
was
not
shot
we
saw
its
nest
in
the
winter
full
of
little
skeletons
heathcliff
set
a
trap
over
it
and
the
old
ones
dared
not
come
i
made
him
promise
he
never
shoot
a
lapwing
after
that
and
he
did
yes
here
are
more
did
he
shoot
my
lapwings
nelly
are
they
red
any
of
them
let
me
look
over
with
that
i
interrupted
dragging
the
pillow
away
and
turning
the
holes
towards
the
mattress
for
she
was
removing
its
contents
by
handfuls
down
and
shut
your
eyes
you
wandering
there
a
mess
the
down
is
flying
about
like
snow
i
went
here
and
there
collecting
it
see
in
you
nelly
she
continued
dreamily
aged
woman
you
have
grey
hair
and
bent
shoulders
this
bed
is
the
fairy
cave
under
penistone
crags
and
you
are
gathering
to
hurt
our
heifers
pretending
while
i
am
near
that
they
are
only
locks
of
wool
that
what
come
to
fifty
years
hence
i
know
you
are
not
so
now
i
not
wandering
you
mistaken
or
else
i
should
believe
you
really
that
withered
hag
and
i
should
think
i
under
penistone
crags
and
i
conscious
it
night
and
there
are
two
candles
on
the
table
making
the
black
press
shine
like
jet
black
press
where
is
that
i
asked
are
talking
in
your
sleep
against
the
wall
as
it
always
is
she
replied
appear
odd
i
see
a
face
in
it
no
press
in
the
room
and
never
was
said
i
resuming
my
seat
and
looping
up
the
curtain
that
i
might
watch
her
see
that
face
she
inquired
gazing
earnestly
at
the
mirror
and
say
what
i
could
i
was
incapable
of
making
her
comprehend
it
to
be
her
own
so
i
rose
and
covered
it
with
a
shawl
behind
there
still
she
pursued
anxiously
it
stirred
who
is
it
i
hope
it
will
not
come
out
when
you
are
gone
oh
nelly
the
room
is
haunted
i
afraid
of
being
alone
i
took
her
hand
in
mine
and
bid
her
be
composed
for
a
succession
of
shudders
convulsed
her
frame
and
she
would
keep
straining
her
gaze
towards
the
glass
nobody
here
i
insisted
was
linton
you
knew
it
a
while
since
she
gasped
the
clock
is
striking
twelve
it
true
then
that
dreadful
her
fingers
clutched
the
clothes
and
gathered
them
over
her
eyes
i
attempted
to
steal
to
the
door
with
an
intention
of
calling
her
husband
but
i
was
summoned
back
by
a
piercing
shriek
the
shawl
had
dropped
from
the
frame
what
is
the
matter
cried
i
is
coward
now
wake
up
that
is
the
glass
the
mirror
linton
and
you
see
yourself
in
it
and
there
am
i
too
by
your
side
trembling
and
bewildered
she
held
me
fast
but
the
horror
gradually
passed
from
her
countenance
its
paleness
gave
place
to
a
glow
of
shame
dear
i
thought
i
was
at
home
she
sighed
thought
i
was
lying
in
my
chamber
at
wuthering
heights
because
i
weak
my
brain
got
confused
and
i
screamed
unconsciously
do
say
anything
but
stay
with
me
i
dread
sleeping
my
dreams
appal
me
sound
sleep
would
do
you
good
i
answered
i
hope
this
suffering
will
prevent
your
trying
starving
again
if
i
were
but
in
my
own
bed
in
the
old
house
she
went
on
bitterly
wringing
her
hands
that
wind
sounding
in
the
firs
by
the
lattice
do
let
me
feel
it
it
comes
straight
down
the
moor
do
let
me
have
one
breath
to
pacify
her
i
held
the
casement
ajar
a
few
seconds
a
cold
blast
rushed
through
i
closed
it
and
returned
to
my
post
she
lay
still
now
her
face
bathed
in
tears
exhaustion
of
body
had
entirely
subdued
her
spirit
our
fiery
catherine
was
no
better
than
a
wailing
child
long
is
it
since
i
shut
myself
in
here
she
asked
suddenly
reviving
was
monday
evening
i
replied
this
is
thursday
night
or
rather
friday
morning
at
present
of
the
same
week
she
exclaimed
that
brief
time
enough
to
live
on
nothing
but
cold
water
and
observed
i
it
seems
a
weary
number
of
hours
she
muttered
doubtfully
must
be
more
i
remember
being
in
the
parlour
after
they
had
quarrelled
and
edgar
being
cruelly
provoking
and
me
running
into
this
room
desperate
as
soon
as
ever
i
had
barred
the
door
utter
blackness
overwhelmed
me
and
i
fell
on
the
floor
i
could
explain
to
edgar
how
certain
i
felt
of
having
a
fit
or
going
raging
mad
if
he
persisted
in
teasing
me
i
had
no
command
of
tongue
or
brain
and
he
did
not
guess
my
agony
perhaps
it
barely
left
me
sense
to
try
to
escape
from
him
and
his
voice
before
i
recovered
sufficiently
to
see
and
hear
it
began
to
be
dawn
and
nelly
i
tell
you
what
i
thought
and
what
has
kept
recurring
and
recurring
till
i
feared
for
my
reason
i
thought
as
i
lay
there
with
my
head
against
that
table
leg
and
my
eyes
dimly
discerning
the
grey
square
of
the
window
that
i
was
enclosed
in
the
bed
at
home
and
my
heart
ached
with
some
great
grief
which
just
waking
i
could
not
recollect
i
pondered
and
worried
myself
to
discover
what
it
could
be
and
most
strangely
the
whole
last
seven
years
of
my
life
grew
a
blank
i
did
not
recall
that
they
had
been
at
all
i
was
a
child
my
father
was
just
buried
and
my
misery
arose
from
the
separation
that
hindley
had
ordered
between
me
and
heathcliff
i
was
laid
alone
for
the
first
time
and
rousing
from
a
dismal
doze
after
a
night
of
weeping
i
lifted
my
hand
to
push
the
panels
aside
it
struck
the
i
swept
it
along
the
carpet
and
then
memory
burst
in
my
late
anguish
was
swallowed
in
a
paroxysm
of
despair
i
can
not
say
why
i
felt
so
wildly
wretched
it
must
have
been
temporary
derangement
for
there
is
scarcely
cause
but
supposing
at
twelve
years
old
i
had
been
wrenched
from
the
heights
and
every
early
association
and
my
all
in
all
as
heathcliff
was
at
that
time
and
been
converted
at
a
stroke
into
linton
the
lady
of
thrushcross
grange
and
the
wife
of
a
stranger
an
exile
and
outcast
thenceforth
from
what
had
been
my
world
you
may
fancy
a
glimpse
of
the
abyss
where
i
grovelled
shake
your
head
as
you
will
nelly
you
have
helped
to
unsettle
me
you
should
have
spoken
to
edgar
indeed
you
should
and
compelled
him
to
leave
me
quiet
oh
burning
i
wish
i
were
out
of
doors
i
wish
i
were
a
girl
again
half
savage
and
hardy
and
free
and
laughing
at
injuries
not
maddening
under
them
why
am
i
so
changed
why
does
my
blood
rush
into
a
hell
of
tumult
at
a
few
words
i
sure
i
should
be
myself
were
i
once
among
the
heather
on
those
hills
open
the
window
again
wide
fasten
it
open
quick
why
do
you
move
i
wo
give
you
your
death
of
cold
i
answered
wo
give
me
a
chance
of
life
you
mean
she
said
sullenly
i
not
helpless
yet
i
open
it
myself
and
sliding
from
the
bed
before
i
could
hinder
her
she
crossed
the
room
walking
very
uncertainly
threw
it
back
and
bent
out
careless
of
the
frosty
air
that
cut
about
her
shoulders
as
keen
as
a
knife
i
entreated
and
finally
attempted
to
force
her
to
retire
but
i
soon
found
her
delirious
strength
much
surpassed
mine
she
was
delirious
i
became
convinced
by
her
subsequent
actions
and
ravings
there
was
no
moon
and
everything
beneath
lay
in
misty
darkness
not
a
light
gleamed
from
any
house
far
or
near
all
had
been
extinguished
long
ago
and
those
at
wuthering
heights
were
never
visible
still
she
asserted
she
caught
their
shining
she
cried
eagerly
my
room
with
the
candle
in
it
and
the
trees
swaying
before
it
and
the
other
candle
is
in
joseph
garret
joseph
sits
up
late
does
he
he
waiting
till
i
come
home
that
he
may
lock
the
gate
well
he
wait
a
while
yet
it
a
rough
journey
and
a
sad
heart
to
travel
it
and
we
must
pass
by
gimmerton
kirk
to
go
that
journey
we
braved
its
ghosts
often
together
and
dared
each
other
to
stand
among
the
graves
and
ask
them
to
come
but
heathcliff
if
i
dare
you
now
will
you
venture
if
you
do
i
keep
you
i
not
lie
there
by
myself
they
may
bury
me
twelve
feet
deep
and
throw
the
church
down
over
me
but
i
wo
rest
till
you
are
with
me
i
never
will
she
paused
and
resumed
with
a
strange
smile
considering
rather
i
come
to
him
find
a
way
then
not
through
that
kirkyard
you
are
slow
be
content
you
always
followed
me
perceiving
it
vain
to
argue
against
her
insanity
i
was
planning
how
i
could
reach
something
to
wrap
about
her
without
quitting
my
hold
of
herself
for
i
could
not
trust
her
alone
by
the
gaping
lattice
when
to
my
consternation
i
heard
the
rattle
of
the
and
linton
entered
he
had
only
then
come
from
the
library
and
in
passing
through
the
lobby
had
noticed
our
talking
and
been
attracted
by
curiosity
or
fear
to
examine
what
it
signified
at
that
late
hour
sir
i
cried
checking
the
exclamation
risen
to
his
lips
at
the
sight
which
met
him
and
the
bleak
atmosphere
of
the
chamber
poor
mistress
is
ill
and
she
quite
masters
me
i
can
not
manage
her
at
all
pray
come
and
persuade
her
to
go
to
bed
forget
your
anger
for
hard
to
guide
any
way
but
her
own
ill
he
said
hastening
to
us
the
window
ellen
catherine
why
he
was
silent
the
haggardness
of
linton
appearance
smote
him
speechless
and
he
could
only
glance
from
her
to
me
in
horrified
astonishment
been
fretting
here
i
continued
eating
scarcely
anything
and
never
complaining
she
would
admit
none
of
us
till
this
evening
and
so
we
could
inform
you
of
her
state
as
we
were
not
aware
of
it
ourselves
but
it
is
nothing
i
felt
i
uttered
my
explanations
awkwardly
the
master
frowned
is
nothing
is
it
ellen
dean
he
said
sternly
shall
account
more
clearly
for
keeping
me
ignorant
of
this
and
he
took
his
wife
in
his
arms
and
looked
at
her
with
anguish
at
first
she
gave
him
no
glance
of
recognition
he
was
invisible
to
her
abstracted
gaze
the
delirium
was
not
fixed
however
having
weaned
her
eyes
from
contemplating
the
outer
darkness
by
degrees
she
centred
her
attention
on
him
and
discovered
who
it
was
that
held
her
you
are
come
are
you
edgar
linton
she
said
with
angry
animation
are
one
of
those
things
that
are
ever
found
when
least
wanted
and
when
you
are
wanted
never
i
suppose
we
shall
have
plenty
of
lamentations
now
i
see
we
shall
but
they
ca
keep
me
from
my
narrow
home
out
yonder
my
where
i
bound
before
spring
is
over
there
it
is
not
among
the
lintons
mind
under
the
but
in
the
open
air
with
a
and
you
may
please
yourself
whether
you
go
to
them
or
come
to
me
what
have
you
done
commenced
the
master
i
nothing
to
you
any
more
do
you
love
that
wretch
heath
cried
linton
this
moment
you
mention
that
name
and
i
end
the
matter
instantly
by
a
spring
from
the
window
what
you
touch
at
present
you
may
have
but
my
soul
will
be
on
that
before
you
lay
hands
on
me
again
i
do
want
you
edgar
i
past
wanting
you
return
to
your
books
i
glad
you
possess
a
consolation
for
all
you
had
in
me
is
gone
mind
wanders
sir
i
interposed
has
been
talking
nonsense
the
whole
evening
but
let
her
have
quiet
and
proper
attendance
and
she
rally
hereafter
we
must
be
cautious
how
we
vex
her
desire
no
further
advice
from
you
answered
linton
knew
your
mistress
nature
and
you
encouraged
me
to
harass
her
and
not
to
give
me
one
hint
of
how
she
has
been
these
three
days
it
was
heartless
months
of
sickness
could
not
cause
such
a
change
i
began
to
defend
myself
thinking
it
too
bad
to
be
blamed
for
wicked
waywardness
knew
linton
nature
to
be
headstrong
and
domineering
cried
i
i
did
know
that
you
wished
to
foster
her
fierce
temper
i
did
know
that
to
humour
her
i
should
wink
at
heathcliff
i
performed
the
duty
of
a
faithful
servant
in
telling
you
and
i
have
got
a
faithful
servant
wages
well
it
will
teach
me
to
be
careful
next
time
next
time
you
may
gather
intelligence
for
yourself
next
time
you
bring
a
tale
to
me
you
shall
quit
my
service
ellen
dean
he
replied
rather
hear
nothing
about
it
i
suppose
then
mr
linton
said
i
has
your
permission
to
come
to
miss
and
to
drop
in
at
every
opportunity
your
absence
offers
on
purpose
to
poison
the
mistress
against
you
confused
as
catherine
was
her
wits
were
alert
at
applying
our
conversation
nelly
has
played
traitor
she
exclaimed
passionately
is
my
hidden
enemy
you
witch
so
you
do
seek
to
hurt
us
let
me
go
and
i
make
her
rue
i
make
her
howl
a
recantation
a
maniac
fury
kindled
under
her
brows
she
struggled
desperately
to
disengage
herself
from
linton
arms
i
felt
no
inclination
to
tarry
the
event
and
resolving
to
seek
medical
aid
on
my
own
responsibility
i
quitted
the
chamber
in
passing
the
garden
to
reach
the
road
at
a
place
where
a
bridle
hook
is
driven
into
the
wall
i
saw
something
white
moved
irregularly
evidently
by
another
agent
than
the
wind
notwithstanding
my
hurry
i
stayed
to
examine
it
lest
ever
after
i
should
have
the
conviction
impressed
on
my
imagination
that
it
was
a
creature
of
the
other
world
my
surprise
and
perplexity
were
great
on
discovering
by
touch
more
than
vision
miss
isabella
springer
fanny
suspended
by
a
handkerchief
and
nearly
at
its
last
gasp
i
quickly
released
the
animal
and
lifted
it
into
the
garden
i
had
seen
it
follow
its
mistress
when
she
went
to
bed
and
wondered
much
how
it
could
have
got
out
there
and
what
mischievous
person
had
treated
it
so
while
untying
the
knot
round
the
hook
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
repeatedly
caught
the
beat
of
horses
feet
galloping
at
some
distance
but
there
were
such
a
number
of
things
to
occupy
my
reflections
that
i
hardly
gave
the
circumstance
a
thought
though
it
was
a
strange
sound
in
that
place
at
two
in
the
morning
kenneth
was
fortunately
just
issuing
from
his
house
to
see
a
patient
in
the
village
as
i
came
up
the
street
and
my
account
of
catherine
linton
malady
induced
him
to
accompany
me
back
immediately
he
was
a
plain
rough
man
and
he
made
no
scruple
to
speak
his
doubts
of
her
surviving
this
second
attack
unless
she
were
more
submissive
to
his
directions
than
she
had
shown
herself
before
dean
said
he
ca
help
fancying
there
an
extra
cause
for
this
what
has
there
been
to
do
at
the
grange
we
odd
reports
up
here
a
stout
hearty
lass
like
catherine
does
not
fall
ill
for
a
trifle
and
that
sort
of
people
should
not
either
it
hard
work
bringing
them
through
fevers
and
such
things
how
did
it
begin
master
will
inform
you
i
answered
you
are
acquainted
with
the
earnshaws
violent
dispositions
and
linton
caps
them
all
i
may
say
this
it
commenced
in
a
quarrel
she
was
struck
during
a
tempest
of
passion
with
a
kind
of
fit
that
her
account
at
least
for
she
flew
off
in
the
height
of
it
and
locked
herself
up
afterwards
she
refused
to
eat
and
now
she
alternately
raves
and
remains
in
a
half
dream
knowing
those
about
her
but
having
her
mind
filled
with
all
sorts
of
strange
ideas
and
illusions
linton
will
be
sorry
observed
kenneth
interrogatively
he
break
his
heart
should
anything
happen
i
replied
alarm
him
more
than
necessary
i
told
him
to
beware
said
my
companion
he
must
bide
the
consequences
of
neglecting
my
warning
has
he
been
intimate
with
heathcliff
lately
frequently
visits
at
the
grange
answered
i
more
on
the
strength
of
the
mistress
having
known
him
when
a
boy
than
because
the
master
likes
his
company
at
present
he
discharged
from
the
trouble
of
calling
owing
to
some
presumptuous
aspirations
after
miss
linton
which
he
manifested
i
hardly
think
he
be
taken
in
again
does
miss
linton
turn
a
cold
shoulder
on
him
was
the
doctor
next
question
not
in
her
confidence
returned
i
reluctant
to
continue
the
subject
she
a
sly
one
he
remarked
shaking
his
head
keeps
her
own
counsel
but
she
a
real
little
fool
i
have
it
from
good
authority
that
last
night
and
a
pretty
night
it
was
she
and
heathcliff
were
walking
in
the
plantation
at
the
back
of
your
house
above
two
hours
and
he
pressed
her
not
to
go
in
again
but
just
mount
his
horse
and
away
with
him
my
informant
said
she
could
only
put
him
off
by
pledging
her
word
of
honour
to
be
prepared
on
their
first
meeting
after
that
when
it
was
to
be
he
did
hear
but
you
urge
linton
to
look
sharp
this
news
filled
me
with
fresh
fears
i
outstripped
kenneth
and
ran
most
of
the
way
back
the
little
dog
was
yelping
in
the
garden
yet
i
spared
a
minute
to
open
the
gate
for
it
but
instead
of
going
to
the
house
door
it
coursed
up
and
down
snuffing
the
grass
and
would
have
escaped
to
the
road
had
i
not
seized
it
and
conveyed
it
in
with
me
on
ascending
to
isabella
room
my
suspicions
were
confirmed
it
was
empty
had
i
been
a
few
hours
sooner
linton
illness
might
have
arrested
her
rash
step
but
what
could
be
done
now
there
was
a
bare
possibility
of
overtaking
them
if
pursued
instantly
could
not
pursue
them
however
and
i
dared
not
rouse
the
family
and
fill
the
place
with
confusion
still
less
unfold
the
business
to
my
master
absorbed
as
he
was
in
his
present
calamity
and
having
no
heart
to
spare
for
a
second
grief
i
saw
nothing
for
it
but
to
hold
my
tongue
and
suffer
matters
to
take
their
course
and
kenneth
being
arrived
i
went
with
a
badly
composed
countenance
to
announce
him
catherine
lay
in
a
troubled
sleep
her
husband
had
succeeded
in
soothing
the
excess
of
frenzy
he
now
hung
over
her
pillow
watching
every
shade
and
every
change
of
her
painfully
expressive
features
the
doctor
on
examining
the
case
for
himself
spoke
hopefully
to
him
of
its
having
a
favourable
termination
if
we
could
only
preserve
around
her
perfect
and
constant
tranquillity
to
me
he
signified
the
threatening
danger
was
not
so
much
death
as
permanent
alienation
of
intellect
i
did
not
close
my
eyes
that
night
nor
did
linton
indeed
we
never
went
to
bed
and
the
servants
were
all
up
long
before
the
usual
hour
moving
through
the
house
with
stealthy
tread
and
exchanging
whispers
as
they
encountered
each
other
in
their
vocations
every
one
was
active
but
miss
isabella
and
they
began
to
remark
how
sound
she
slept
her
brother
too
asked
if
she
had
risen
and
seemed
impatient
for
her
presence
and
hurt
that
she
showed
so
little
anxiety
for
her
i
trembled
lest
he
should
send
me
to
call
her
but
i
was
spared
the
pain
of
being
the
first
proclaimant
of
her
flight
one
of
the
maids
a
thoughtless
girl
who
had
been
on
an
early
errand
to
gimmerton
came
panting
and
dashed
into
the
chamber
crying
dear
dear
what
mun
we
have
next
master
master
our
young
lady
your
noise
cried
i
hastily
enraged
at
her
clamorous
manner
lower
mary
what
is
the
matter
said
linton
ails
your
young
lady
gone
she
gone
yon
heathcliff
run
off
wi
her
gasped
the
girl
is
not
true
exclaimed
linton
rising
in
agitation
can
not
be
how
has
the
idea
entered
your
head
ellen
dean
go
and
seek
her
it
is
incredible
it
can
not
be
as
he
spoke
he
took
the
servant
to
the
door
and
then
repeated
his
demand
to
know
her
reasons
for
such
an
assertion
i
met
on
the
road
a
lad
that
fetches
milk
here
she
stammered
he
asked
whether
we
were
in
trouble
at
the
grange
i
thought
he
meant
for
missis
sickness
so
i
answered
yes
then
says
he
somebody
gone
after
i
guess
i
stared
he
saw
i
knew
nought
about
it
and
he
told
how
a
gentleman
and
lady
had
stopped
to
have
a
shoe
fastened
at
a
blacksmith
shop
two
miles
out
of
gimmerton
not
very
long
after
midnight
and
how
the
blacksmith
lass
had
got
up
to
spy
who
they
were
she
knew
them
both
directly
and
she
noticed
the
man
heathcliff
it
was
she
felt
certain
could
mistake
him
besides
put
a
sovereign
in
her
father
hand
for
payment
the
lady
had
a
cloak
about
her
face
but
having
desired
a
sup
of
water
while
she
drank
it
fell
back
and
she
saw
her
very
plain
heathcliff
held
both
bridles
as
they
rode
on
and
they
set
their
faces
from
the
village
and
went
as
fast
as
the
rough
roads
would
let
them
the
lass
said
nothing
to
her
father
but
she
told
it
all
over
gimmerton
this
morning
i
ran
and
peeped
for
form
sake
into
isabella
room
confirming
when
i
returned
the
servant
statement
linton
had
resumed
his
seat
by
the
bed
on
my
he
raised
his
eyes
read
the
meaning
of
my
blank
aspect
and
dropped
them
without
giving
an
order
or
uttering
a
word
we
to
try
any
measures
for
overtaking
and
bringing
her
back
i
inquired
should
we
do
went
of
her
own
accord
answered
the
master
had
a
right
to
go
if
she
pleased
trouble
me
no
more
about
her
hereafter
she
is
only
my
sister
in
name
not
because
i
disown
her
but
because
she
has
disowned
me
and
that
was
all
he
said
on
the
subject
he
did
not
make
single
inquiry
further
or
mention
her
in
any
way
except
directing
me
to
send
what
property
she
had
in
the
house
to
her
fresh
home
wherever
it
was
when
i
knew
it
chapter
xiii
for
two
months
the
fugitives
remained
absent
in
those
two
months
linton
encountered
and
conquered
the
worst
shock
of
what
was
denominated
a
brain
fever
no
mother
could
have
nursed
an
only
child
more
devotedly
than
edgar
tended
her
day
and
night
he
was
watching
and
patiently
enduring
all
the
annoyances
that
irritable
nerves
and
a
shaken
reason
could
inflict
and
though
kenneth
remarked
that
what
he
saved
from
the
grave
would
only
recompense
his
care
by
forming
the
source
of
constant
future
anxiety
in
fact
that
his
health
and
strength
were
being
sacrificed
to
preserve
a
mere
ruin
of
humanity
he
knew
no
limits
in
gratitude
and
joy
when
catherine
life
was
declared
out
of
danger
and
hour
after
hour
he
would
sit
beside
her
tracing
the
gradual
return
to
bodily
health
and
flattering
his
too
sanguine
hopes
with
the
illusion
that
her
mind
would
settle
back
to
its
right
balance
also
and
she
would
soon
be
entirely
her
former
self
the
first
time
she
left
her
chamber
was
at
the
commencement
of
the
following
march
linton
had
put
on
her
pillow
in
the
morning
a
handful
of
golden
crocuses
her
eye
long
stranger
to
any
gleam
of
pleasure
caught
them
in
waking
and
shone
delighted
as
she
gathered
them
eagerly
together
are
the
earliest
flowers
at
the
heights
she
exclaimed
remind
me
of
soft
thaw
winds
and
warm
sunshine
and
nearly
melted
snow
edgar
is
there
not
a
south
wind
and
is
not
the
snow
almost
gone
snow
is
quite
gone
down
here
darling
replied
her
husband
i
only
see
two
white
spots
on
the
whole
range
of
moors
the
sky
is
blue
and
the
larks
are
singing
and
the
becks
and
brooks
are
all
brim
full
catherine
last
spring
at
this
time
i
was
longing
to
have
you
under
this
roof
now
i
wish
you
were
a
mile
or
two
up
those
hills
the
air
blows
so
sweetly
i
feel
that
it
would
cure
you
shall
never
be
there
but
once
more
said
the
invalid
then
you
leave
me
and
i
shall
remain
for
ever
next
spring
you
long
again
to
have
me
under
this
roof
and
you
look
back
and
think
you
were
happy
linton
lavished
on
her
the
kindest
caresses
and
tried
to
cheer
her
by
the
fondest
words
but
vaguely
regarding
the
flowers
she
let
the
tears
collect
on
her
lashes
and
stream
down
her
cheeks
unheeding
we
knew
she
was
really
better
and
therefore
decided
that
long
confinement
to
a
single
place
produced
much
of
this
despondency
and
it
might
be
partially
removed
by
a
change
of
scene
the
master
told
me
to
light
a
fire
in
the
deserted
parlour
and
to
set
an
in
the
sunshine
by
the
window
and
then
he
brought
her
down
and
she
sat
a
long
while
enjoying
the
genial
heat
and
as
we
expected
revived
by
the
objects
round
her
which
though
familiar
were
free
from
the
dreary
associations
investing
her
hated
sick
chamber
by
evening
she
seemed
greatly
exhausted
yet
no
arguments
could
persuade
her
to
return
to
that
apartment
and
i
had
to
arrange
the
parlour
sofa
for
her
bed
till
another
room
could
be
prepared
to
obviate
the
fatigue
of
mounting
and
descending
the
stairs
we
fitted
up
this
where
you
lie
at
present
on
the
same
floor
with
the
parlour
and
she
was
soon
strong
enough
to
move
from
one
to
the
other
leaning
on
edgar
arm
ah
i
thought
myself
she
might
recover
so
waited
on
as
she
was
and
there
was
double
cause
to
desire
it
for
on
her
existence
depended
that
of
another
we
cherished
the
hope
that
in
a
little
while
linton
heart
would
be
gladdened
and
his
lands
secured
from
a
stranger
grip
by
the
birth
of
an
heir
i
should
mention
that
isabella
sent
to
her
brother
some
six
weeks
from
her
departure
a
short
note
announcing
her
marriage
with
heathcliff
it
appeared
dry
and
cold
but
at
the
bottom
was
dotted
in
with
pencil
an
obscure
apology
and
an
entreaty
for
kind
remembrance
and
reconciliation
if
her
proceeding
had
offended
him
asserting
that
she
could
not
help
it
then
and
being
done
she
had
now
no
power
to
repeal
it
linton
did
not
reply
to
this
i
believe
and
in
a
fortnight
more
i
got
a
long
letter
which
i
considered
odd
coming
from
the
pen
of
a
bride
just
out
of
the
honeymoon
i
read
it
for
i
keep
it
yet
any
relic
of
the
dead
is
precious
if
they
were
valued
living
dear
ellen
it
begins
i
came
last
night
to
wuthering
heights
and
heard
for
the
first
time
that
catherine
has
been
and
is
yet
very
ill
i
must
not
write
to
her
i
suppose
and
my
brother
is
either
too
angry
or
too
distressed
to
answer
what
i
sent
him
still
i
must
write
to
somebody
and
the
only
choice
left
me
is
you
inform
edgar
that
i
give
the
world
to
see
his
face
again
that
my
heart
returned
to
thrushcross
grange
in
hours
after
i
left
it
and
is
there
at
this
moment
full
of
warm
feelings
for
him
and
catherine
ca
follow
it
these
words
are
underlined
they
need
not
expect
me
and
they
may
draw
what
conclusions
they
please
taking
care
however
to
lay
nothing
at
the
door
of
my
weak
will
or
deficient
affection
the
remainder
of
the
letter
is
for
yourself
alone
i
want
to
ask
you
two
questions
the
first
is
how
did
you
contrive
to
preserve
the
common
sympathies
of
human
nature
when
you
resided
here
i
can
not
recognise
any
sentiment
which
those
around
share
with
me
the
second
question
i
have
great
interest
in
it
is
this
is
heathcliff
a
man
if
so
is
he
mad
and
if
not
is
he
a
devil
i
tell
my
reasons
for
making
this
inquiry
but
i
beseech
you
to
explain
if
you
can
what
i
have
married
that
is
when
you
call
to
see
me
and
you
must
call
ellen
very
soon
do
write
but
come
and
bring
me
something
from
edgar
now
you
shall
hear
how
i
have
been
received
in
my
new
home
as
i
am
led
to
imagine
the
heights
will
be
it
is
to
amuse
myself
that
i
dwell
on
such
subjects
as
the
lack
of
external
comforts
they
never
occupy
my
thoughts
except
at
the
moment
when
i
miss
them
i
should
laugh
and
dance
for
joy
if
i
found
their
absence
was
the
total
of
my
miseries
and
the
rest
was
an
unnatural
dream
the
sun
set
behind
the
grange
as
we
turned
on
to
the
moors
by
that
i
judged
it
to
be
six
and
my
companion
halted
half
an
hour
to
inspect
the
park
and
the
gardens
and
probably
the
place
itself
as
well
as
he
could
so
it
was
dark
when
we
dismounted
in
the
paved
yard
of
the
and
your
old
joseph
issued
out
to
receive
us
by
the
light
of
a
dip
candle
he
did
it
with
a
courtesy
that
redounded
to
his
credit
his
first
act
was
to
elevate
his
torch
to
a
level
with
my
face
squint
malignantly
project
his
and
turn
away
then
he
took
the
two
horses
and
led
them
into
the
stables
reappearing
for
the
purpose
of
locking
the
outer
gate
as
if
we
lived
in
an
ancient
castle
heathcliff
stayed
to
speak
to
him
and
i
entered
the
kitchen
a
dingy
untidy
hole
i
daresay
you
would
not
know
it
it
is
so
changed
since
it
was
in
your
charge
by
the
fire
stood
a
ruffianly
child
strong
in
limb
and
dirty
in
garb
with
a
look
of
catherine
in
his
eyes
and
about
his
mouth
is
edgar
legal
nephew
i
reflected
in
a
manner
i
must
shake
hands
and
yes
i
must
kiss
him
it
is
right
to
establish
a
good
understanding
at
the
beginning
i
approached
and
attempting
to
take
his
chubby
fist
said
do
you
do
my
dear
he
replied
in
a
jargon
i
did
not
comprehend
you
and
i
be
friends
hareton
was
my
next
essay
at
conversation
an
oath
and
a
threat
to
set
throttler
on
me
if
i
did
not
rewarded
my
perseverance
throttler
lad
whispered
the
little
wretch
rousing
a
from
its
lair
in
a
corner
wilt
thou
be
ganging
he
asked
authoritatively
love
for
my
life
urged
a
compliance
i
stepped
over
the
threshold
to
wait
till
the
others
should
enter
heathcliff
was
nowhere
visible
and
joseph
whom
i
followed
to
the
stables
and
requested
to
accompany
me
in
after
staring
and
muttering
to
himself
screwed
up
his
nose
and
replied
mim
mim
did
iver
christian
body
hear
aught
like
it
mincing
un
munching
how
can
i
tell
whet
ye
say
say
i
wish
you
to
come
with
me
into
the
house
i
cried
thinking
him
deaf
yet
highly
disgusted
at
his
rudeness
o
me
i
getten
summut
else
to
do
he
answered
and
continued
his
work
moving
his
lantern
jaws
meanwhile
and
surveying
my
dress
and
countenance
the
former
a
great
deal
too
fine
but
the
latter
i
sure
as
sad
as
he
could
desire
with
sovereign
contempt
i
walked
round
the
yard
and
through
a
wicket
to
another
door
at
which
i
took
the
liberty
of
knocking
in
hopes
some
more
civil
servant
might
show
himself
after
a
short
suspense
it
was
opened
by
a
tall
gaunt
man
without
neckerchief
and
otherwise
extremely
slovenly
his
features
were
lost
in
masses
of
shaggy
hair
that
hung
on
his
shoulders
and
eyes
too
were
like
a
ghostly
catherine
with
all
their
beauty
annihilated
your
business
here
he
demanded
grimly
are
you
name
was
isabella
linton
i
replied
seen
me
before
sir
i
lately
married
to
heathcliff
and
he
has
brought
me
here
i
suppose
by
your
permission
he
come
back
then
asked
the
hermit
glaring
like
a
hungry
wolf
we
came
just
now
i
said
he
left
me
by
the
kitchen
door
and
when
i
would
have
gone
in
your
little
boy
played
sentinel
over
the
place
and
frightened
me
off
by
the
help
of
a
well
the
hellish
villain
has
kept
his
word
growled
my
future
host
searching
the
darkness
beyond
me
in
expectation
of
discovering
heathcliff
and
then
he
indulged
in
a
soliloquy
of
execrations
and
threats
of
what
he
would
have
done
had
the
deceived
him
i
repented
having
tried
this
second
entrance
and
was
almost
inclined
to
slip
away
before
he
finished
cursing
but
ere
i
could
execute
that
intention
he
ordered
me
in
and
shut
and
the
door
there
was
a
great
fire
and
that
was
all
the
light
in
the
huge
apartment
whose
floor
had
grown
a
uniform
grey
and
the
once
brilliant
which
used
to
attract
my
gaze
when
i
was
a
girl
partook
of
a
similar
obscurity
created
by
tarnish
and
dust
i
inquired
whether
i
might
call
the
maid
and
be
conducted
to
a
bedroom
earnshaw
vouchsafed
no
answer
he
walked
up
and
down
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
apparently
quite
forgetting
my
presence
and
his
abstraction
was
evidently
so
deep
and
his
whole
aspect
so
misanthropical
that
i
shrank
from
disturbing
him
again
you
not
be
surprised
ellen
at
my
feeling
particularly
cheerless
seated
in
worse
than
solitude
on
that
inhospitable
hearth
and
remembering
that
four
miles
distant
lay
my
delightful
home
containing
the
only
people
i
loved
on
earth
and
there
might
as
well
be
the
atlantic
to
part
us
instead
of
those
four
miles
i
could
not
overpass
them
i
questioned
with
myself
where
must
i
turn
for
comfort
and
mind
you
do
tell
edgar
or
catherine
above
every
sorrow
beside
this
rose
despair
at
finding
nobody
who
could
or
would
be
my
ally
against
heathcliff
i
had
sought
shelter
at
wuthering
heights
almost
gladly
because
i
was
secured
by
that
arrangement
from
living
alone
with
him
but
he
knew
the
people
we
were
coming
amongst
and
he
did
not
fear
their
intermeddling
i
sat
and
thought
a
doleful
time
the
clock
struck
eight
and
nine
and
still
my
companion
paced
to
and
fro
his
head
bent
on
his
breast
and
perfectly
silent
unless
a
groan
or
a
bitter
ejaculation
forced
itself
out
at
intervals
i
listened
to
detect
a
woman
voice
in
the
house
and
filled
the
interim
with
wild
regrets
and
dismal
anticipations
which
at
last
spoke
audibly
in
irrepressible
sighing
and
weeping
i
was
not
aware
how
openly
i
grieved
till
earnshaw
halted
opposite
in
his
measured
walk
and
gave
me
a
stare
of
surprise
taking
advantage
of
his
recovered
attention
i
exclaimed
tired
with
my
journey
and
i
want
to
go
to
bed
where
is
the
direct
me
to
her
as
she
wo
come
to
me
have
none
he
answered
must
wait
on
yourself
must
i
sleep
then
i
sobbed
i
was
beyond
regarding
weighed
down
by
fatigue
and
wretchedness
will
show
you
heathcliff
chamber
said
he
that
door
he
in
there
i
was
going
to
obey
but
he
suddenly
arrested
me
and
added
in
the
strangest
tone
so
good
as
to
turn
your
lock
and
draw
your
bolt
do
omit
it
i
said
why
mr
earnshaw
i
did
not
relish
the
notion
of
deliberately
fastening
myself
in
with
heathcliff
here
he
replied
pulling
from
his
waistcoat
a
pistol
having
a
spring
knife
attached
to
the
barrel
a
great
tempter
to
a
desperate
man
is
it
not
i
can
not
resist
going
up
with
this
every
night
and
trying
his
door
if
once
i
find
it
open
he
done
for
i
do
it
invariably
even
though
the
minute
before
i
have
been
recalling
a
hundred
reasons
that
should
make
me
refrain
it
is
some
devil
that
urges
me
to
thwart
my
own
schemes
by
killing
him
you
fight
against
that
devil
for
love
as
long
as
you
may
when
the
time
comes
not
all
the
angels
in
heaven
shall
save
him
i
surveyed
the
weapon
inquisitively
a
hideous
notion
struck
me
how
powerful
i
should
be
possessing
such
an
instrument
i
took
it
from
his
hand
and
touched
the
blade
he
looked
astonished
at
the
expression
my
face
assumed
during
a
brief
second
it
was
not
horror
it
was
covetousness
he
snatched
the
pistol
back
jealously
shut
the
knife
and
returned
it
to
its
concealment
do
care
if
you
tell
him
said
he
him
on
his
guard
and
watch
for
him
you
know
the
terms
we
are
on
i
see
his
danger
does
not
shock
you
has
heathcliff
done
to
you
i
asked
what
has
he
wronged
you
to
warrant
this
appalling
hatred
would
it
be
wiser
to
bid
him
quit
the
house
thundered
earnshaw
he
offer
to
leave
me
he
a
dead
man
persuade
him
to
attempt
it
and
you
are
a
murderess
am
i
to
lose
without
a
chance
of
retrieval
is
hareton
to
be
a
beggar
oh
damnation
i
have
it
back
and
i
have
gold
too
and
then
his
blood
and
hell
shall
have
his
soul
it
will
be
ten
times
blacker
with
that
guest
than
ever
it
was
before
you
acquainted
me
ellen
with
your
old
master
habits
he
is
clearly
on
the
verge
of
madness
he
was
so
last
night
at
least
i
shuddered
to
be
near
him
and
thought
on
the
servant
moroseness
as
comparatively
agreeable
he
now
recommenced
his
moody
walk
and
i
raised
the
latch
and
escaped
into
the
kitchen
joseph
was
bending
over
the
fire
peering
into
a
large
pan
that
swung
above
it
and
a
wooden
bowl
of
oatmeal
stood
on
the
settle
close
by
the
contents
of
the
pan
began
to
boil
and
he
turned
to
plunge
his
hand
into
the
bowl
i
conjectured
that
this
preparation
was
probably
for
our
supper
and
being
hungry
i
resolved
it
should
be
eatable
so
crying
out
sharply
make
the
porridge
i
removed
the
vessel
out
of
his
reach
and
proceeded
to
take
off
my
hat
and
earnshaw
i
continued
me
to
wait
on
myself
i
will
i
not
going
to
act
the
lady
among
you
for
fear
i
should
starve
lord
he
muttered
sitting
down
and
stroking
his
ribbed
stockings
from
the
knee
to
the
ankle
there
to
be
fresh
ortherings
just
when
i
getten
used
to
two
maisters
if
i
mun
hev
a
set
my
heead
it
like
time
to
be
flitting
i
niver
think
to
see
t
day
that
i
mud
lave
th
owld
place
but
i
doubt
it
nigh
at
hand
this
lamentation
drew
no
notice
from
me
i
went
briskly
to
work
sighing
to
remember
a
period
when
it
would
have
been
all
merry
fun
but
compelled
speedily
to
drive
off
the
remembrance
it
racked
me
to
recall
past
happiness
and
the
greater
peril
there
was
of
conjuring
up
its
apparition
the
quicker
the
thible
ran
round
and
the
faster
the
handfuls
of
meal
fell
into
the
water
joseph
beheld
my
style
of
cookery
with
growing
indignation
he
ejaculated
thou
will
sup
thy
porridge
they
be
naught
but
lumps
as
big
as
my
neive
thear
agean
i
fling
in

un
all
if
i
wer
ye
there
pale
t
guilp
off
then
ye
hae
done
wi
bang
bang
it
a
mercy
t
bothom
deaved
out
it
rather
a
rough
mess
i
own
when
poured
into
the
basins
four
had
been
provided
and
a
gallon
pitcher
of
new
milk
was
brought
from
the
dairy
which
hareton
seized
and
commenced
drinking
and
spilling
from
the
expansive
lip
i
expostulated
and
desired
that
he
should
have
his
in
a
mug
affirming
that
i
could
not
taste
the
liquid
treated
so
dirtily
the
old
cynic
chose
to
be
vastly
offended
at
this
nicety
assuring
me
repeatedly
that
barn
was
every
bit
as
good
as
i
every
bit
as
wollsome
and
wondering
how
i
could
fashion
to
be
so
conceited
meanwhile
the
infant
ruffian
continued
sucking
and
glowered
up
at
me
defyingly
as
he
slavered
into
the
jug
shall
have
my
supper
in
another
room
i
said
you
no

parlour
he
echoed
sneeringly

i
answered
me
a
chamber
i
put
my
basin
on
a
tray
and
went
myself
to
fetch
some
more
milk
with
great
grumblings
the
fellow
rose
and
preceded
me
in
my
ascent
we
mounted
to
the
garrets
he
opened
a
door
now
and
then
to
look
into
the
apartments
we
passed
a
rahm
he
said
at
last
flinging
back
a
cranky
board
on
hinges
weel
eneugh
to
ate
a
few
porridge

a
kind
of
smelling

of
malt
and
grain
various
sacks
of
which
articles
were
piled
around
leaving
a
wide
bare
space
in
the
middle
man
i
exclaimed
facing
him
angrily
is

he
repeated
in
a
tone
of
mockery
see
all
thear
is
yon
mine
he
pointed
into
the
second
garret
only
differing
from
the
first
in
being
more
naked
about
the
walls
and
having
a
large
low
curtainless
bed
with
an
quilt
at
one
end
do

i
retorted
suppose

of

he
as

un
iver

o
but
hisseln
a
nice
house
joseph
i
could
not
refrain
from
observing
pleasant
inmates
and
i
think
the
concentrated
essence
of
all
the
madness
in
the
world
took
up
its
abode
in
my
brain
the
day
i
linked
my
fate
with
theirs
however
that
is
not
to
the
present
purpose
there
are
other
rooms
for
heaven
sake
be
quick
and
let
me
settle
somewhere
he
made
no
reply
to
this
adjuration
only
plodding
doggedly
down
the
wooden
steps
and
halting
before
an
apartment
which
from
that
halt
and
the
superior
quality
of
its
furniture
i
conjectured
to
be
the
best
one
there
was
a
carpet
a
good
one
but
the
pattern
was
obliterated
by
dust
a
fireplace
hung
with
dropping
to
pieces
a
handsome
with
ample
crimson
curtains
of
rather
expensive
material
and
modern
make
but
they
had
evidently
experienced
rough
usage
the
vallances
hung
in
festoons
wrenched
from
their
rings
and
the
iron
rod
supporting
them
was
bent
in
an
arc
on
one
side
causing
the
drapery
to
trail
upon
the
floor
the
chairs
were
also
damaged
many
of
them
severely
and
deep
indentations
deformed
the
panels
of
the
walls
i
was
endeavouring
to
gather
resolution
for
entering
and
taking
possession
when
my
fool
of
a
guide
announced
here
is
t
maister
my
supper
by
this
time
was
cold
my
appetite
gone
and
my
patience
exhausted
i
insisted
on
being
provided
instantly
with
a
place
of
refuge
and
means
of
repose
the
divil
began
the
religious
elder
lord
bless

the

th

i
was
so
vexed
i
flung
my
tray
and
its
contents
on
the
ground
and
then
seated
myself
at
the
hid
my
face
in
my
hands
and
cried
ech
exclaimed

nobbut
wish

and
so
he
went
on
scolding
to
his
den
beneath
taking
the
candle
with
him
and
i
remained
in
the
dark
the
period
of
reflection
succeeding
this
silly
action
compelled
me
to
admit
the
necessity
of
smothering
my
pride
and
choking
my
wrath
and
bestirring
myself
to
remove
its
effects
an
unexpected
aid
presently
appeared
in
the
shape
of
throttler
whom
i
now
recognised
as
a
son
of
our
old
skulker
it
had
spent
its
whelphood
at
the
grange
and
was
given
by
my
father
to
hindley
i
fancy
it
knew
me
it
pushed
its
nose
against
mine
by
way
of
salute
and
then
hastened
to
devour
the
porridge
while
i
groped
from
step
to
step
collecting
the
shattered
earthenware
and
drying
the
spatters
of
milk
from
the
banister
with
my
our
labours
were
scarcely
over
when
i
heard
earnshaw
tread
in
the
passage
my
assistant
tucked
in
his
tail
and
pressed
to
the
wall
i
stole
into
the
nearest
doorway
the
dog
endeavour
to
avoid
him
was
unsuccessful
as
i
guessed
by
a
scutter
and
a
prolonged
piteous
yelping
i
had
better
luck
he
passed
on
entered
his
chamber
and
shut
the
door
directly
after
joseph
came
up
with
hareton
to
put
him
to
bed
i
had
found
shelter
in
hareton
room
and
the
old
man
on
seeing
me
said
rahm
for
boath
ye
un
yer
pride
now
i
sud
think
i
the
hahse
empty
ye
may
hev
it
all
to
yerseln
un
him
as
allus
maks
a
third
sich
ill
company
gladly
did
i
take
advantage
of
this
intimation
and
the
minute
i
flung
myself
into
a
chair
by
the
fire
i
nodded
and
slept
my
slumber
was
deep
and
sweet
though
over
far
too
soon
heathcliff
awoke
me
he
had
just
come
in
and
demanded
in
his
loving
manner
what
i
was
doing
there
i
told
him
the
cause
of
my
staying
up
so
late
that
he
had
the
key
of
our
room
in
his
pocket
the
adjective
gave
mortal
offence
he
swore
it
was
not
nor
ever
should
be
mine
and
he
but
i
not
repeat
his
language
nor
describe
his
habitual
conduct
he
is
ingenious
and
unresting
in
seeking
to
gain
my
abhorrence
i
sometimes
wonder
at
him
with
an
intensity
that
deadens
my
fear
yet
i
assure
you
a
tiger
or
a
venomous
serpent
could
not
rouse
terror
in
me
equal
to
that
which
he
wakens
he
told
me
of
catherine
illness
and
accused
my
brother
of
causing
it
promising
that
i
should
be
edgar
proxy
in
suffering
till
he
could
get
hold
of
him
i
do
hate
him
i
am
wretched
i
have
been
a
fool
beware
of
uttering
one
breath
of
this
to
any
one
at
the
grange
i
shall
expect
you
every
day
do
disappoint
me
isabella
chapter
xiv
as
soon
as
i
had
perused
this
epistle
i
went
to
the
master
and
informed
him
that
his
sister
had
arrived
at
the
heights
and
sent
me
a
letter
expressing
her
sorrow
for
linton
situation
and
her
ardent
desire
to
see
him
with
a
wish
that
he
would
transmit
to
her
as
early
as
possible
some
token
of
forgiveness
by
me
said
linton
have
nothing
to
forgive
her
ellen
you
may
call
at
wuthering
heights
this
afternoon
if
you
like
and
say
that
i
am
not
angry
but
i
sorry
to
have
lost
her
especially
as
i
can
never
think
she
be
happy
it
is
out
of
the
question
my
going
to
see
her
however
we
are
eternally
divided
and
should
she
really
wish
to
oblige
me
let
her
persuade
the
villain
she
has
married
to
leave
the
country
you
wo
write
her
a
little
note
sir
i
asked
imploringly
he
answered
is
needless
my
communication
with
family
shall
be
as
sparing
as
his
with
mine
it
shall
not
exist
edgar
coldness
depressed
me
exceedingly
and
all
the
way
from
the
grange
i
puzzled
my
brains
how
to
put
more
heart
into
what
he
said
when
i
repeated
it
and
how
to
soften
his
refusal
of
even
a
few
lines
to
console
isabella
i
daresay
she
had
been
on
the
watch
for
me
since
morning
i
saw
her
looking
through
the
lattice
as
i
came
up
the
garden
causeway
and
i
nodded
to
her
but
she
drew
back
as
if
afraid
of
being
observed
i
entered
without
knocking
there
never
was
such
a
dreary
dismal
scene
as
the
formerly
cheerful
house
presented
i
must
confess
that
if
i
had
been
in
the
young
lady
place
i
would
at
least
have
swept
the
hearth
and
wiped
the
tables
with
a
duster
but
she
already
partook
of
the
pervading
spirit
of
neglect
which
encompassed
her
her
pretty
face
was
wan
and
listless
her
hair
uncurled
some
locks
hanging
lankly
down
and
some
carelessly
twisted
round
her
head
probably
she
had
not
touched
her
dress
since
yester
evening
hindley
was
not
there
heathcliff
sat
at
a
table
turning
over
some
papers
in
his
but
he
rose
when
i
appeared
asked
me
how
i
did
quite
friendly
and
offered
me
a
chair
he
was
the
only
thing
there
that
seemed
decent
and
i
thought
he
never
looked
better
so
much
had
circumstances
altered
their
positions
that
he
would
certainly
have
struck
a
stranger
as
a
born
and
bred
gentleman
and
his
wife
as
a
thorough
little
slattern
she
came
forward
eagerly
to
greet
me
and
held
out
one
hand
to
take
the
expected
letter
i
shook
my
head
she
understand
the
hint
but
followed
me
to
a
sideboard
where
i
went
to
lay
my
bonnet
and
importuned
me
in
a
whisper
to
give
her
directly
what
i
had
brought
heathcliff
guessed
the
meaning
of
her
manoeuvres
and
said
you
have
got
anything
for
isabella
as
no
doubt
you
have
nelly
give
it
to
her
you
need
make
a
secret
of
it
we
have
no
secrets
between
us
i
have
nothing
i
replied
thinking
it
best
to
speak
the
truth
at
once
master
bid
me
tell
his
sister
that
she
must
not
expect
either
a
letter
or
a
visit
from
him
at
present
he
sends
his
love
and
his
wishes
for
your
happiness
and
his
pardon
for
the
grief
you
have
occasioned
but
he
thinks
that
after
this
time
his
household
and
the
household
here
should
drop
intercommunication
as
nothing
could
come
of
keeping
it
up
heathcliff
lip
quivered
slightly
and
she
returned
to
her
seat
in
the
window
her
husband
took
his
stand
on
the
hearthstone
near
me
and
began
to
put
questions
concerning
catherine
i
told
him
as
much
as
i
thought
proper
of
her
illness
and
he
extorted
from
me
by
most
of
the
facts
connected
with
its
origin
i
blamed
her
as
she
deserved
for
bringing
it
all
on
herself
and
ended
by
hoping
that
he
would
follow
linton
example
and
avoid
future
interference
with
his
family
for
good
or
evil
linton
is
now
just
recovering
i
said
never
be
like
she
was
but
her
life
is
spared
and
if
you
really
have
a
regard
for
her
you
shun
crossing
her
way
again
nay
you
move
out
of
this
country
entirely
and
that
you
may
not
regret
it
i
inform
you
catherine
linton
is
as
different
now
from
your
old
friend
catherine
earnshaw
as
that
young
lady
is
different
from
me
her
appearance
is
changed
greatly
her
character
much
more
so
and
the
person
who
is
compelled
of
necessity
to
be
her
companion
will
only
sustain
his
affection
hereafter
by
the
remembrance
of
what
she
once
was
by
common
humanity
and
a
sense
of
duty
is
quite
possible
remarked
heathcliff
forcing
himself
to
seem
calm
possible
that
your
master
should
have
nothing
but
common
humanity
and
a
sense
of
duty
to
fall
back
upon
but
do
you
imagine
that
i
shall
leave
catherine
to
his
and
and
can
you
compare
my
feelings
respecting
catherine
to
his
before
you
leave
this
house
i
must
exact
a
promise
from
you
that
you
get
me
an
interview
with
her
consent
or
refuse
i
see
her
what
do
you
say
say
heathcliff
i
replied
must
not
you
never
shall
through
my
means
another
encounter
between
you
and
the
master
would
kill
her
altogether
your
aid
that
may
be
avoided
he
continued
should
there
be
danger
of
such
an
event
should
he
be
the
cause
of
adding
a
single
trouble
more
to
her
existence
why
i
think
i
shall
be
justified
in
going
to
extremes
i
wish
you
had
sincerity
enough
to
tell
me
whether
catherine
would
suffer
greatly
from
his
loss
the
fear
that
she
would
restrains
me
and
there
you
see
the
distinction
between
our
feelings
had
he
been
in
my
place
and
i
in
his
though
i
hated
him
with
a
hatred
that
turned
my
life
to
gall
i
never
would
have
raised
a
hand
against
him
you
may
look
incredulous
if
you
please
i
never
would
have
banished
him
from
her
society
as
long
as
she
desired
his
the
moment
her
regard
ceased
i
would
have
torn
his
heart
out
and
drunk
his
blood
but
till
then
if
you
do
believe
me
you
do
know
me
till
then
i
would
have
died
by
inches
before
i
touched
a
single
hair
of
his
head
yet
i
interrupted
have
no
scruples
in
completely
ruining
all
hopes
of
her
perfect
restoration
by
thrusting
yourself
into
her
remembrance
now
when
she
has
nearly
forgotten
you
and
involving
her
in
a
new
tumult
of
discord
and
distress
suppose
she
has
nearly
forgotten
me
he
said
nelly
you
know
she
has
not
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
for
every
thought
she
spends
on
linton
she
spends
a
thousand
on
me
at
a
most
miserable
period
of
my
life
i
had
a
notion
of
the
kind
it
haunted
me
on
my
return
to
the
neighbourhood
last
summer
but
only
her
own
assurance
could
make
me
admit
the
horrible
idea
again
and
then
linton
would
be
nothing
nor
hindley
nor
all
the
dreams
that
ever
i
dreamt
two
words
would
comprehend
my
future
and
existence
after
losing
her
would
be
hell
yet
i
was
a
fool
to
fancy
for
a
moment
that
she
valued
edgar
attachment
more
than
mine
if
he
loved
with
all
the
powers
of
his
puny
being
he
could
love
as
much
in
eighty
years
as
i
could
in
a
day
and
catherine
has
a
heart
as
deep
as
i
have
the
sea
could
be
as
readily
contained
in
that
as
her
whole
affection
be
monopolised
by
him
tush
he
is
scarcely
a
degree
dearer
to
her
than
her
dog
or
her
horse
it
is
not
in
him
to
be
loved
like
me
how
can
she
love
in
him
what
he
has
not
and
edgar
are
as
fond
of
each
other
as
any
two
people
can
be
cried
isabella
with
sudden
vivacity
one
has
a
right
to
talk
in
that
manner
and
i
wo
hear
my
brother
depreciated
in
silence
brother
is
wondrous
fond
of
you
too
is
he
observed
heathcliff
scornfully
turns
you
adrift
on
the
world
with
surprising
alacrity
is
not
aware
of
what
i
suffer
she
replied
did
tell
him
that
have
been
telling
him
something
then
you
have
written
have
you
say
that
i
was
married
i
did
write
you
saw
the
note
nothing
since
young
lady
is
looking
sadly
the
worse
for
her
change
of
condition
i
remarked
love
comes
short
in
her
case
obviously
whose
i
may
guess
but
perhaps
i
should
say
should
guess
it
was
her
own
said
heathcliff
degenerates
into
a
mere
slut
she
is
tired
of
trying
to
please
me
uncommonly
early
hardly
credit
it
but
the
very
morrow
of
our
wedding
she
was
weeping
to
go
home
however
she
suit
this
house
so
much
the
better
for
not
being
over
nice
and
i
take
care
she
does
not
disgrace
me
by
rambling
abroad
sir
returned
i
hope
you
consider
that
heathcliff
is
accustomed
to
be
looked
after
and
waited
on
and
that
she
has
been
brought
up
like
an
only
daughter
whom
every
one
was
ready
to
serve
you
must
let
her
have
a
maid
to
keep
things
tidy
about
her
and
you
must
treat
her
kindly
whatever
be
your
notion
of
edgar
you
can
not
doubt
that
she
has
a
capacity
for
strong
attachments
or
she
would
have
abandoned
the
elegancies
and
comforts
and
friends
of
her
former
home
to
fix
contentedly
in
such
a
wilderness
as
this
with
you
abandoned
them
under
a
delusion
he
answered
in
me
a
hero
of
romance
and
expecting
unlimited
indulgences
from
my
chivalrous
devotion
i
can
hardly
regard
her
in
the
light
of
a
rational
creature
so
obstinately
has
she
persisted
in
forming
a
fabulous
notion
of
my
character
and
acting
on
the
false
impressions
she
cherished
but
at
last
i
think
she
begins
to
know
me
i
do
perceive
the
silly
smiles
and
grimaces
that
provoked
me
at
first
and
the
senseless
incapability
of
discerning
that
i
was
in
earnest
when
i
gave
her
my
opinion
of
her
infatuation
and
herself
it
was
a
marvellous
effort
of
perspicacity
to
discover
that
i
did
not
love
her
i
believed
at
one
time
no
lessons
could
teach
her
that
and
yet
it
is
poorly
learnt
for
this
morning
she
announced
as
a
piece
of
appalling
intelligence
that
i
had
actually
succeeded
in
making
her
hate
me
a
positive
labour
of
hercules
i
assure
you
if
it
be
achieved
i
have
cause
to
return
thanks
can
i
trust
your
assertion
isabella
are
you
sure
you
hate
me
if
i
let
you
alone
for
half
a
day
wo
you
come
sighing
and
wheedling
to
me
again
i
daresay
she
would
rather
i
had
seemed
all
tenderness
before
you
it
wounds
her
vanity
to
have
the
truth
exposed
but
i
do
care
who
knows
that
the
passion
was
wholly
on
one
side
and
i
never
told
her
a
lie
about
it
she
can
not
accuse
me
of
showing
one
bit
of
deceitful
softness
the
first
thing
she
saw
me
do
on
coming
out
of
the
grange
was
to
hang
up
her
little
dog
and
when
she
pleaded
for
it
the
first
words
i
uttered
were
a
wish
that
i
had
the
hanging
of
every
being
belonging
to
her
except
one
possibly
she
took
that
exception
for
herself
but
no
brutality
disgusted
her
i
suppose
she
has
an
innate
admiration
of
it
if
only
her
precious
person
were
secure
from
injury
now
was
it
not
the
depth
of
absurdity
of
genuine
idiotcy
for
that
pitiful
slavish
brach
to
dream
that
i
could
love
her
tell
your
master
nelly
that
i
never
in
all
my
life
met
with
such
an
abject
thing
as
she
is
she
even
disgraces
the
name
of
linton
and
i
sometimes
relented
from
pure
lack
of
invention
in
my
experiments
on
what
she
could
endure
and
still
creep
shamefully
cringing
back
but
tell
him
also
to
set
his
fraternal
and
magisterial
heart
at
ease
that
i
keep
strictly
within
the
limits
of
the
law
i
have
avoided
up
to
this
period
giving
her
the
slightest
right
to
claim
a
separation
and
what
more
she
thank
nobody
for
dividing
us
if
she
desired
to
go
she
might
the
nuisance
of
her
presence
outweighs
the
gratification
to
be
derived
from
tormenting
her
heathcliff
said
i
is
the
talk
of
a
madman
your
wife
most
likely
is
convinced
you
are
mad
and
for
that
reason
she
has
borne
with
you
hitherto
but
now
that
you
say
she
may
go
she
doubtless
avail
herself
of
the
permission
you
are
not
so
bewitched
are
you
as
to
remain
with
him
of
your
own
accord
care
ellen
answered
isabella
her
eyes
sparkling
irefully
there
was
no
misdoubting
by
their
expression
the
full
success
of
her
endeavours
to
make
himself
detested
put
faith
in
a
single
word
he
speaks
he
a
lying
fiend
a
monster
and
not
a
human
being
been
told
i
might
leave
him
before
and
i
made
the
attempt
but
i
dare
not
repeat
it
only
ellen
promise
you
not
mention
a
syllable
of
his
infamous
conversation
to
my
brother
or
catherine
whatever
he
may
pretend
he
wishes
to
provoke
edgar
to
desperation
he
says
he
has
married
me
on
purpose
to
obtain
power
over
him
and
he
obtain
it
i
die
first
i
just
hope
i
pray
that
he
may
forget
his
diabolical
prudence
and
kill
me
the
single
pleasure
i
can
imagine
is
to
die
or
to
see
him
dead
that
will
do
for
the
present
said
heathcliff
you
are
called
upon
in
a
court
of
law
you
remember
her
language
nelly
and
take
a
good
look
at
that
countenance
she
near
the
point
which
would
suit
me
no
you
not
fit
to
be
your
own
guardian
isabella
now
and
i
being
your
legal
protector
must
retain
you
in
my
custody
however
distasteful
the
obligation
may
be
go
i
have
something
to
say
to
ellen
dean
in
private
that
not
the
way
i
tell
you
why
this
is
the
road
upstairs
child
he
seized
and
thrust
her
from
the
room
and
returned
muttering
have
no
pity
i
have
no
pity
the
more
the
worms
writhe
the
more
i
yearn
to
crush
out
their
entrails
it
is
a
moral
teething
and
i
grind
with
greater
energy
in
proportion
to
the
increase
of
pain
you
understand
what
the
word
pity
means
i
said
hastening
to
resume
my
bonnet
you
ever
feel
a
touch
of
it
in
your
life
that
down
he
interrupted
perceiving
my
intention
to
depart
are
not
going
yet
come
here
now
nelly
i
must
either
persuade
or
compel
you
to
aid
me
in
fulfilling
my
determination
to
see
catherine
and
that
without
delay
i
swear
that
i
meditate
no
harm
i
do
desire
to
cause
any
disturbance
or
to
exasperate
or
insult
linton
i
only
wish
to
hear
from
herself
how
she
is
and
why
she
has
been
ill
and
to
ask
if
anything
that
i
could
do
would
be
of
use
to
her
last
night
i
was
in
the
grange
garden
six
hours
and
i
return
there
and
every
night
i
haunt
the
place
and
every
day
till
i
find
an
opportunity
of
entering
if
edgar
linton
meets
me
i
shall
not
hesitate
to
knock
him
down
and
give
him
enough
to
insure
his
quiescence
while
i
stay
if
his
servants
oppose
me
i
shall
threaten
them
off
with
these
pistols
but
would
it
be
better
to
prevent
my
coming
in
contact
with
them
or
their
master
and
you
could
do
it
so
easily
i
warn
you
when
i
came
and
then
you
might
let
me
in
unobserved
as
soon
as
she
was
alone
and
watch
till
i
departed
your
conscience
quite
calm
you
would
be
hindering
mischief
i
protested
against
playing
that
treacherous
part
in
my
employer
house
and
besides
i
urged
the
cruelty
and
selfishness
of
his
destroying
linton
tranquillity
for
his
satisfaction
commonest
occurrence
startles
her
painfully
i
said
all
nerves
and
she
bear
the
surprise
i
positive
do
persist
sir
or
else
i
shall
be
obliged
to
inform
my
master
of
your
designs
and
he
take
measures
to
secure
his
house
and
its
inmates
from
any
such
unwarrantable
intrusions
that
case
i
take
measures
to
secure
you
woman
exclaimed
heathcliff
shall
not
leave
wuthering
heights
till
morning
it
is
a
foolish
story
to
assert
that
catherine
could
not
bear
to
see
me
and
as
to
surprising
her
i
do
desire
it
you
must
prepare
her
ask
her
if
i
may
come
you
say
she
never
mentions
my
name
and
that
i
am
never
mentioned
to
her
to
whom
should
she
mention
me
if
i
am
a
forbidden
topic
in
the
house
she
thinks
you
are
all
spies
for
her
husband
oh
i
no
doubt
she
in
hell
among
you
i
guess
by
her
silence
as
much
as
anything
what
she
feels
you
say
she
is
often
restless
and
is
that
a
proof
of
tranquillity
you
talk
of
her
mind
being
unsettled
how
the
devil
could
it
be
otherwise
in
her
frightful
isolation
and
that
insipid
paltry
creature
attending
her
from
and
from
and
he
might
as
well
plant
an
oak
in
a
and
expect
it
to
thrive
as
imagine
he
can
restore
her
to
vigour
in
the
soil
of
his
shallow
cares
let
us
settle
it
at
once
will
you
stay
here
and
am
i
to
fight
my
way
to
catherine
over
linton
and
his
footman
or
will
you
be
my
friend
as
you
have
been
hitherto
and
do
what
i
request
decide
because
there
is
no
reason
for
my
lingering
another
minute
if
you
persist
in
your
stubborn
well
lockwood
i
argued
and
complained
and
flatly
refused
him
fifty
times
but
in
the
long
run
he
forced
me
to
an
agreement
i
engaged
to
carry
a
letter
from
him
to
my
mistress
and
should
she
consent
i
promised
to
let
him
have
intelligence
of
linton
next
absence
from
home
when
he
might
come
and
get
in
as
he
was
able
i
would
be
there
and
my
should
be
equally
out
of
the
way
was
it
right
or
wrong
i
fear
it
was
wrong
though
expedient
i
thought
i
prevented
another
explosion
by
my
compliance
and
i
thought
too
it
might
create
a
favourable
crisis
in
catherine
mental
illness
and
then
i
remembered
edgar
stern
rebuke
of
my
carrying
tales
and
i
tried
to
smooth
away
all
disquietude
on
the
subject
by
affirming
with
frequent
iteration
that
that
betrayal
of
trust
if
it
merited
so
harsh
an
appellation
should
be
the
last
notwithstanding
my
journey
homeward
was
sadder
than
my
journey
thither
and
many
misgivings
i
had
ere
i
could
prevail
on
myself
to
put
the
missive
into
linton
hand
but
here
is
kenneth
i
go
down
and
tell
him
how
much
better
you
are
my
history
is
as
we
say
and
will
serve
to
while
away
another
morning
dree
and
dreary
i
reflected
as
the
good
woman
descended
to
receive
the
doctor
and
not
exactly
of
the
kind
which
i
should
have
chosen
to
amuse
me
but
never
mind
i
extract
wholesome
medicines
from
bitter
herbs
and
firstly
let
me
beware
of
the
fascination
that
lurks
in
catherine
heathcliff
brilliant
eyes
i
should
be
in
a
curious
taking
if
i
surrendered
my
heart
to
that
young
person
and
the
daughter
turned
out
a
second
edition
of
the
mother
chapter
xv
another
week
over
and
i
am
so
many
days
nearer
health
and
spring
i
have
now
heard
all
my
neighbour
history
at
different
sittings
as
the
housekeeper
could
spare
time
from
more
important
occupations
continue
it
in
her
own
words
only
a
little
condensed
she
is
on
the
whole
a
very
fair
narrator
and
i
do
think
i
could
improve
her
style
in
the
evening
she
said
the
evening
of
my
visit
to
the
heights
i
knew
as
well
as
if
i
saw
him
that
heathcliff
was
about
the
place
and
i
shunned
going
out
because
i
still
carried
his
letter
in
my
pocket
and
did
want
to
be
threatened
or
teased
any
more
i
had
made
up
my
mind
not
to
give
it
till
my
master
went
somewhere
as
i
could
not
guess
how
its
receipt
would
affect
catherine
the
consequence
was
that
it
did
not
reach
her
before
the
lapse
of
three
days
the
fourth
was
sunday
and
i
brought
it
into
her
room
after
the
family
were
gone
to
church
there
was
a
manservant
left
to
keep
the
house
with
me
and
we
generally
made
a
practice
of
locking
the
doors
during
the
hours
of
service
but
on
that
occasion
the
weather
was
so
warm
and
pleasant
that
i
set
them
wide
open
and
to
fulfil
my
engagement
as
i
knew
who
would
be
coming
i
told
my
companion
that
the
mistress
wished
very
much
for
some
oranges
and
he
must
run
over
to
the
village
and
get
a
few
to
be
paid
for
on
the
morrow
he
departed
and
i
went
linton
sat
in
a
loose
white
dress
with
a
light
shawl
over
her
shoulders
in
the
recess
of
the
open
window
as
usual
her
thick
long
hair
had
been
partly
removed
at
the
beginning
of
her
illness
and
now
she
wore
it
simply
combed
in
its
natural
tresses
over
her
temples
and
neck
her
appearance
was
altered
as
i
had
told
heathcliff
but
when
she
was
calm
there
seemed
unearthly
beauty
in
the
change
the
flash
of
her
eyes
had
been
succeeded
by
a
dreamy
and
melancholy
softness
they
no
longer
gave
the
impression
of
looking
at
the
objects
around
her
they
appeared
always
to
gaze
beyond
and
far
beyond
you
would
have
said
out
of
this
world
then
the
paleness
of
her
face
its
haggard
aspect
having
vanished
as
she
recovered
flesh
and
the
peculiar
expression
arising
from
her
mental
state
though
painfully
suggestive
of
their
causes
added
to
the
touching
interest
which
she
awakened
and
invariably
to
me
i
know
and
to
any
person
who
saw
her
i
should
think
refuted
more
tangible
proofs
of
convalescence
and
stamped
her
as
one
doomed
to
decay
a
book
lay
spread
on
the
sill
before
her
and
the
scarcely
perceptible
wind
fluttered
its
leaves
at
intervals
i
believe
linton
had
laid
it
there
for
she
never
endeavoured
to
divert
herself
with
reading
or
occupation
of
any
kind
and
he
would
spend
many
an
hour
in
trying
to
entice
her
attention
to
some
subject
which
had
formerly
been
her
amusement
she
was
conscious
of
his
aim
and
in
her
better
moods
endured
his
efforts
placidly
only
showing
their
uselessness
by
now
and
then
suppressing
a
wearied
sigh
and
checking
him
at
last
with
the
saddest
of
smiles
and
kisses
at
other
times
she
would
turn
petulantly
away
and
hide
her
face
in
her
hands
or
even
push
him
off
angrily
and
then
he
took
care
to
let
her
alone
for
he
was
certain
of
doing
no
good
gimmerton
chapel
bells
were
still
ringing
and
the
full
mellow
flow
of
the
beck
in
the
valley
came
soothingly
on
the
ear
it
was
a
sweet
substitute
for
the
yet
absent
murmur
of
the
summer
foliage
which
drowned
that
music
about
the
grange
when
the
trees
were
in
leaf
at
wuthering
heights
it
always
sounded
on
quiet
days
following
a
great
thaw
or
a
season
of
steady
rain
and
of
wuthering
heights
catherine
was
thinking
as
she
listened
that
is
if
she
thought
or
listened
at
all
but
she
had
the
vague
distant
look
i
mentioned
before
which
expressed
no
recognition
of
material
things
either
by
ear
or
eye
a
letter
for
you
linton
i
said
gently
inserting
it
in
one
hand
that
rested
on
her
knee
must
read
it
immediately
because
it
wants
an
answer
shall
i
break
the
seal
she
answered
without
altering
the
direction
of
her
eyes
i
opened
it
it
was
very
short
i
continued
it
she
drew
away
her
hand
and
let
it
fall
i
replaced
it
in
her
lap
and
stood
waiting
till
it
should
please
her
to
glance
down
but
that
movement
was
so
long
delayed
that
at
last
i
resumed
i
read
it
it
is
from
mr
heathcliff
there
was
a
start
and
a
troubled
gleam
of
recollection
and
a
struggle
to
arrange
her
ideas
she
lifted
the
letter
and
seemed
to
peruse
it
and
when
she
came
to
the
signature
she
sighed
yet
still
i
found
she
had
not
gathered
its
import
for
upon
my
desiring
to
hear
her
reply
she
merely
pointed
to
the
name
and
gazed
at
me
with
mournful
and
questioning
eagerness
he
wishes
to
see
you
said
i
guessing
her
need
of
an
interpreter
in
the
garden
by
this
time
and
impatient
to
know
what
answer
i
shall
bring
as
i
spoke
i
observed
a
large
dog
lying
on
the
sunny
grass
beneath
raise
its
ears
as
if
about
to
bark
and
then
smoothing
them
back
announce
by
a
wag
of
the
tail
that
some
one
approached
whom
it
did
not
consider
a
stranger
linton
bent
forward
and
listened
breathlessly
the
minute
after
a
step
traversed
the
hall
the
open
house
was
too
tempting
for
heathcliff
to
resist
walking
in
most
likely
he
supposed
that
i
was
inclined
to
shirk
my
promise
and
so
resolved
to
trust
to
his
own
audacity
with
straining
eagerness
catherine
gazed
towards
the
entrance
of
her
chamber
he
did
not
hit
the
right
room
directly
she
motioned
me
to
admit
him
but
he
found
it
out
ere
i
could
reach
the
door
and
in
a
stride
or
two
was
at
her
side
and
had
her
grasped
in
his
arms
he
neither
spoke
nor
loosed
his
hold
for
some
five
minutes
during
which
period
he
bestowed
more
kisses
than
ever
he
gave
in
his
life
before
i
daresay
but
then
my
mistress
had
kissed
him
first
and
i
plainly
saw
that
he
could
hardly
bear
for
downright
agony
to
look
into
her
face
the
same
conviction
had
stricken
him
as
me
from
the
instant
he
beheld
her
that
there
was
no
prospect
of
ultimate
recovery
there
she
was
fated
sure
to
die
cathy
oh
my
life
how
can
i
bear
it
was
the
first
sentence
he
uttered
in
a
tone
that
did
not
seek
to
disguise
his
despair
and
now
he
stared
at
her
so
earnestly
that
i
thought
the
very
intensity
of
his
gaze
would
bring
tears
into
his
eyes
but
they
burned
with
anguish
they
did
not
melt
now
said
catherine
leaning
back
and
returning
his
look
with
a
suddenly
clouded
brow
her
humour
was
a
mere
vane
for
constantly
varying
caprices
and
edgar
have
broken
my
heart
heathcliff
and
you
both
come
to
bewail
the
deed
to
me
as
if
you
were
the
people
to
be
pitied
i
shall
not
pity
you
not
i
you
have
killed
me
and
thriven
on
it
i
think
how
strong
you
are
how
many
years
do
you
mean
to
live
after
i
am
gone
heathcliff
had
knelt
on
one
knee
to
embrace
her
he
attempted
to
rise
but
she
seized
his
hair
and
kept
him
down
wish
i
could
hold
you
she
continued
bitterly
we
were
both
dead
i
should
care
what
you
suffered
i
care
nothing
for
your
sufferings
why
should
you
suffer
i
do
will
you
forget
me
will
you
be
happy
when
i
am
in
the
earth
will
you
say
twenty
years
hence
that
the
grave
of
catherine
earnshaw
i
loved
her
long
ago
and
was
wretched
to
lose
her
but
it
is
past
i
loved
many
others
since
my
children
are
dearer
to
me
than
she
was
and
at
death
i
shall
not
rejoice
that
i
am
going
to
her
i
shall
be
sorry
that
i
must
leave
them
will
you
say
so
heathcliff
torture
me
till
i
as
mad
as
yourself
cried
he
wrenching
his
head
free
and
grinding
his
teeth
the
two
to
a
cool
spectator
made
a
strange
and
fearful
picture
well
might
catherine
deem
that
heaven
would
be
a
land
of
exile
to
her
unless
with
her
mortal
body
she
cast
away
her
moral
character
also
her
present
countenance
had
a
wild
vindictiveness
in
its
white
cheek
and
a
bloodless
lip
and
scintillating
eye
and
she
retained
in
her
closed
fingers
a
portion
of
the
locks
she
had
been
grasping
as
to
her
companion
while
raising
himself
with
one
hand
he
had
taken
her
arm
with
the
other
and
so
inadequate
was
his
stock
of
gentleness
to
the
requirements
of
her
condition
that
on
his
letting
go
i
saw
four
distinct
impressions
left
blue
in
the
colourless
skin
you
possessed
with
a
devil
he
pursued
savagely
talk
in
that
manner
to
me
when
you
are
dying
do
you
reflect
that
all
those
words
will
be
branded
in
my
memory
and
eating
deeper
eternally
after
you
have
left
me
you
know
you
lie
to
say
i
have
killed
you
and
catherine
you
know
that
i
could
as
soon
forget
you
as
my
existence
is
it
not
sufficient
for
your
infernal
selfishness
that
while
you
are
at
peace
i
shall
writhe
in
the
torments
of
hell
shall
not
be
at
peace
moaned
catherine
recalled
to
a
sense
of
physical
weakness
by
the
violent
unequal
throbbing
of
her
heart
which
beat
visibly
and
audibly
under
this
excess
of
agitation
she
said
nothing
further
till
the
paroxysm
was
over
then
she
continued
more
kindly
not
wishing
you
greater
torment
than
i
have
heathcliff
i
only
wish
us
never
to
be
parted
and
should
a
word
of
mine
distress
you
hereafter
think
i
feel
the
same
distress
underground
and
for
my
own
sake
forgive
me
come
here
and
kneel
down
again
you
never
harmed
me
in
your
life
nay
if
you
nurse
anger
that
will
be
worse
to
remember
than
my
harsh
words
wo
you
come
here
again
do
heathcliff
went
to
the
back
of
her
chair
and
leant
over
but
not
so
far
as
to
let
her
see
his
face
which
was
livid
with
emotion
she
bent
round
to
look
at
him
he
would
not
permit
it
turning
abruptly
he
walked
to
the
fireplace
where
he
stood
silent
with
his
back
towards
us
linton
glance
followed
him
suspiciously
every
movement
woke
a
new
sentiment
in
her
after
a
pause
and
a
prolonged
gaze
she
resumed
addressing
me
in
accents
of
indignant
disappointment
you
see
nelly
he
would
not
relent
a
moment
to
keep
me
out
of
the
grave
is
how
i
loved
well
never
mind
that
is
not
heathcliff
i
shall
love
mine
yet
and
take
him
with
me
he
in
my
soul
and
added
she
musingly
thing
that
irks
me
most
is
this
shattered
prison
after
all
i
tired
of
being
enclosed
here
wearying
to
escape
into
that
glorious
world
and
to
be
always
there
not
seeing
it
dimly
through
tears
and
yearning
for
it
through
the
walls
of
an
aching
heart
but
really
with
it
and
in
it
nelly
you
think
you
are
better
and
more
fortunate
than
i
in
full
health
and
strength
you
are
sorry
for
me
very
soon
that
will
be
altered
i
shall
be
sorry
for
i
shall
be
incomparably
beyond
and
above
you
all
i
he
wo
be
near
me
she
went
on
to
herself
thought
he
wished
it
heathcliff
dear
you
should
not
be
sullen
now
do
come
to
me
heathcliff
in
her
eagerness
she
rose
and
supported
herself
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
at
that
earnest
appeal
he
turned
to
her
looking
absolutely
desperate
his
eyes
wide
and
wet
at
last
flashed
fiercely
on
her
his
breast
heaved
convulsively
an
instant
they
held
asunder
and
then
how
they
met
i
hardly
saw
but
catherine
made
a
spring
and
he
caught
her
and
they
were
locked
in
an
embrace
from
which
i
thought
my
mistress
would
never
be
released
alive
in
fact
to
my
eyes
she
seemed
directly
insensible
he
flung
himself
into
the
nearest
seat
and
on
my
approaching
hurriedly
to
ascertain
if
she
had
fainted
he
gnashed
at
me
and
foamed
like
a
mad
dog
and
gathered
her
to
him
with
greedy
jealousy
i
did
not
feel
as
if
i
were
in
the
company
of
a
creature
of
my
own
species
it
appeared
that
he
would
not
understand
though
i
spoke
to
him
so
i
stood
off
and
held
my
tongue
in
great
perplexity
a
movement
of
catherine
relieved
me
a
little
presently
she
put
up
her
hand
to
clasp
his
neck
and
bring
her
cheek
to
his
as
he
held
her
while
he
in
return
covering
her
with
frantic
caresses
said
wildly
teach
me
now
how
cruel
you
been
cruel
and
false
did
you
despise
me
did
you
betray
your
own
heart
cathy
i
have
not
one
word
of
comfort
you
deserve
this
you
have
killed
yourself
yes
you
may
kiss
me
and
cry
and
wring
out
my
kisses
and
tears
they
blight
you
they
damn
you
you
loved
me
then
what
had
you
to
leave
me
what
right
answer
me
for
the
poor
fancy
you
felt
for
linton
because
misery
and
degradation
and
death
and
nothing
that
god
or
satan
could
inflict
would
have
parted
us
of
your
own
will
did
it
i
have
not
broken
your
heart
have
broken
it
and
in
breaking
it
you
have
broken
mine
so
much
the
worse
for
me
that
i
am
strong
do
i
want
to
live
what
kind
of
living
will
it
be
when
you
oh
god
would
like
to
live
with
your
soul
in
the
grave
me
alone
let
me
alone
sobbed
catherine
i
done
wrong
i
dying
for
it
it
is
enough
you
left
me
too
but
i
wo
upbraid
you
i
forgive
you
forgive
me
is
hard
to
forgive
and
to
look
at
those
eyes
and
feel
those
wasted
hands
he
answered
me
again
and
do
let
me
see
your
eyes
i
forgive
what
you
have
done
to
me
i
love
murderer
but
how
can
i
they
were
silent
their
faces
hid
against
each
other
and
washed
by
each
other
tears
at
least
i
suppose
the
weeping
was
on
both
sides
as
it
seemed
heathcliff
could
weep
on
a
great
occasion
like
this
i
grew
very
uncomfortable
meanwhile
for
the
afternoon
wore
fast
away
the
man
whom
i
had
sent
off
returned
from
his
errand
and
i
could
distinguish
by
the
shine
of
the
western
sun
up
the
valley
a
concourse
thickening
outside
gimmerton
chapel
porch
is
over
i
announced
master
will
be
here
in
half
an
hour
heathcliff
groaned
a
curse
and
strained
catherine
closer
she
never
moved
ere
long
i
perceived
a
group
of
the
servants
passing
up
the
road
towards
the
kitchen
wing
linton
was
not
far
behind
he
opened
the
gate
himself
and
sauntered
slowly
up
probably
enjoying
the
lovely
afternoon
that
breathed
as
soft
as
summer
he
is
here
i
exclaimed
heaven
sake
hurry
down
not
meet
any
one
on
the
front
stairs
do
be
quick
and
stay
among
the
trees
till
he
is
fairly
in
must
go
cathy
said
heathcliff
seeking
to
extricate
himself
from
his
companion
arms
if
i
live
i
see
you
again
before
you
are
asleep
i
wo
stray
five
yards
from
your
window
must
not
go
she
answered
holding
him
as
firmly
as
her
strength
allowed
not
i
tell
you
one
hour
he
pleaded
earnestly
for
one
minute
she
replied
linton
will
be
up
immediately
persisted
the
alarmed
intruder
he
would
have
risen
and
unfixed
her
fingers
by
the
act
she
clung
fast
gasping
there
was
mad
resolution
in
her
face
she
shrieked
do
do
go
it
is
the
last
time
edgar
will
not
hurt
us
heathcliff
i
shall
die
i
shall
die
the
fool
there
he
is
cried
heathcliff
sinking
back
into
his
seat
my
darling
hush
hush
catherine
i
stay
if
he
shot
me
so
i
expire
with
a
blessing
on
my
lips
and
there
they
were
fast
again
i
heard
my
master
mounting
the
stairs
the
cold
sweat
ran
from
my
forehead
i
was
horrified
you
going
to
listen
to
her
ravings
i
said
passionately
does
not
know
what
she
says
will
you
ruin
her
because
she
has
not
wit
to
help
herself
get
up
you
could
be
free
instantly
that
is
the
most
diabolical
deed
that
ever
you
did
we
are
all
done
for
master
mistress
and
servant
i
wrung
my
hands
and
cried
out
and
linton
hastened
his
step
at
the
noise
in
the
midst
of
my
agitation
i
was
sincerely
glad
to
observe
that
catherine
arms
had
fallen
relaxed
and
her
head
hung
down
fainted
or
dead
i
thought
much
the
better
far
better
that
she
should
be
dead
than
lingering
a
burden
and
a
to
all
about
her
edgar
sprang
to
his
unbidden
guest
blanched
with
astonishment
and
rage
what
he
meant
to
do
i
can
not
tell
however
the
other
stopped
all
demonstrations
at
once
by
placing
the
form
in
his
arms
there
he
said
you
be
a
fiend
help
her
first
then
you
shall
speak
to
me
he
walked
into
the
parlour
and
sat
down
linton
summoned
me
and
with
great
difficulty
and
after
resorting
to
many
means
we
managed
to
restore
her
to
sensation
but
she
was
all
bewildered
she
sighed
and
moaned
and
knew
nobody
edgar
in
his
anxiety
for
her
forgot
her
hated
friend
i
did
not
i
went
at
the
earliest
opportunity
and
besought
him
to
depart
affirming
that
catherine
was
better
and
he
should
hear
from
me
in
the
morning
how
she
passed
the
night
shall
not
refuse
to
go
out
of
doors
he
answered
i
shall
stay
in
the
garden
and
nelly
mind
you
keep
your
word
i
shall
be
under
those
mind
or
i
pay
another
visit
whether
linton
be
in
or
not
he
sent
a
rapid
glance
through
the
door
of
the
chamber
and
ascertaining
that
what
i
stated
was
apparently
true
delivered
the
house
of
his
luckless
presence
chapter
xvi
about
twelve
that
night
was
born
the
catherine
you
saw
at
wuthering
heights
a
puny
child
and
two
hours
after
the
mother
died
having
never
recovered
sufficient
consciousness
to
miss
heathcliff
or
know
edgar
the
latter
distraction
at
his
bereavement
is
a
subject
too
painful
to
be
dwelt
on
its
showed
how
deep
the
sorrow
sunk
a
great
addition
in
my
eyes
was
his
being
left
without
an
heir
i
bemoaned
that
as
i
gazed
on
the
feeble
orphan
and
i
mentally
abused
old
linton
for
what
was
only
natural
partiality
the
securing
his
estate
to
his
own
daughter
instead
of
his
son
an
unwelcomed
infant
it
was
poor
thing
it
might
have
wailed
out
of
life
and
nobody
cared
a
morsel
during
those
first
hours
of
existence
we
redeemed
the
neglect
afterwards
but
its
beginning
was
as
friendless
as
its
end
is
likely
to
be
next
morning
bright
and
cheerful
out
of
doors
stole
softened
in
through
the
blinds
of
the
silent
room
and
suffused
the
couch
and
its
occupant
with
a
mellow
tender
glow
edgar
linton
had
his
head
laid
on
the
pillow
and
his
eyes
shut
his
young
and
fair
features
were
almost
as
deathlike
as
those
of
the
form
beside
him
and
almost
as
fixed
but
was
the
hush
of
exhausted
anguish
and
of
perfect
peace
her
brow
smooth
her
lids
closed
her
lips
wearing
the
expression
of
a
smile
no
angel
in
heaven
could
be
more
beautiful
than
she
appeared
and
i
partook
of
the
infinite
calm
in
which
she
lay
my
mind
was
never
in
a
holier
frame
than
while
i
gazed
on
that
untroubled
image
of
divine
rest
i
instinctively
echoed
the
words
she
had
uttered
a
few
hours
before
beyond
and
above
us
all
whether
still
on
earth
or
now
in
heaven
her
spirit
is
at
home
with
god
i
do
know
if
it
be
a
peculiarity
in
me
but
i
am
seldom
otherwise
than
happy
while
watching
in
the
chamber
of
death
should
no
frenzied
or
despairing
mourner
share
the
duty
with
me
i
see
a
repose
that
neither
earth
nor
hell
can
break
and
i
feel
an
assurance
of
the
endless
and
shadowless
hereafter
the
eternity
they
have
entered
where
life
is
boundless
in
its
duration
and
love
in
its
sympathy
and
joy
in
its
fulness
i
noticed
on
that
occasion
how
much
selfishness
there
is
even
in
a
love
like
linton
when
he
so
regretted
catherine
blessed
release
to
be
sure
one
might
have
doubted
after
the
wayward
and
impatient
existence
she
had
led
whether
she
merited
a
haven
of
peace
at
last
one
might
doubt
in
seasons
of
cold
reflection
but
not
then
in
the
presence
of
her
corpse
it
asserted
its
own
tranquillity
which
seemed
a
pledge
of
equal
quiet
to
its
former
inhabitant
do
you
believe
such
people
are
happy
in
the
other
world
sir
i
give
a
great
deal
to
know
i
declined
answering
dean
question
which
struck
me
as
something
heterodox
she
proceeded
retracing
the
course
of
catherine
linton
i
fear
we
have
no
right
to
think
she
is
but
we
leave
her
with
her
maker
the
master
looked
asleep
and
i
ventured
soon
after
sunrise
to
quit
the
room
and
steal
out
to
the
pure
refreshing
air
the
servants
thought
me
gone
to
shake
off
the
drowsiness
of
my
protracted
watch
in
reality
my
chief
motive
was
seeing
heathcliff
if
he
had
remained
among
the
larches
all
night
he
would
have
heard
nothing
of
the
stir
at
the
grange
unless
perhaps
he
might
catch
the
gallop
of
the
messenger
going
to
gimmerton
if
he
had
come
nearer
he
would
probably
be
aware
from
the
lights
flitting
to
and
fro
and
the
opening
and
shutting
of
the
outer
doors
that
all
was
not
right
within
i
wished
yet
feared
to
find
him
i
felt
the
terrible
news
must
be
told
and
i
longed
to
get
it
over
but
how
to
do
it
i
did
not
know
he
was
there
at
least
a
few
yards
further
in
the
park
leant
against
an
old
his
hat
off
and
his
hair
soaked
with
the
dew
that
had
gathered
on
the
budded
branches
and
fell
pattering
round
him
he
had
been
standing
a
long
time
in
that
position
for
i
saw
a
pair
of
ousels
passing
and
repassing
scarcely
three
feet
from
him
busy
in
building
their
nest
and
regarding
his
proximity
no
more
than
that
of
a
piece
of
timber
they
flew
off
at
my
approach
and
he
raised
his
eyes
and
spoke
dead
he
said
not
waited
for
you
to
learn
that
put
your
handkerchief
away
do
snivel
before
me
damn
you
all
she
wants
none
of
your
tears
i
was
weeping
as
much
for
him
as
her
we
do
sometimes
pity
creatures
that
have
none
of
the
feeling
either
for
themselves
or
others
when
i
first
looked
into
his
face
i
perceived
that
he
had
got
intelligence
of
the
catastrophe
and
a
foolish
notion
struck
me
that
his
heart
was
quelled
and
he
prayed
because
his
lips
moved
and
his
gaze
was
bent
on
the
ground
she
dead
i
answered
checking
my
sobs
and
drying
my
cheeks
to
heaven
i
hope
where
we
may
every
one
join
her
if
we
take
due
warning
and
leave
our
evil
ways
to
follow
good
take
due
warning
then
asked
heathcliff
attempting
a
sneer
she
die
like
a
saint
come
give
me
a
true
history
of
the
event
how
did
he
endeavoured
to
pronounce
the
name
but
could
not
manage
it
and
compressing
his
mouth
he
held
a
silent
combat
with
his
inward
agony
defying
meanwhile
my
sympathy
with
an
unflinching
ferocious
stare
did
she
die
he
resumed
at
last
fain
notwithstanding
his
hardihood
to
have
a
support
behind
him
for
after
the
struggle
he
trembled
in
spite
of
himself
to
his
very
wretch
i
thought
have
a
heart
and
nerves
the
same
as
your
brother
men
why
should
you
be
anxious
to
conceal
them
your
pride
can
not
blind
god
you
tempt
him
to
wring
them
till
he
forces
a
cry
of
humiliation
as
a
lamb
i
answered
aloud
drew
a
sigh
and
stretched
herself
like
a
child
reviving
and
sinking
again
to
sleep
and
five
minutes
after
i
felt
one
little
pulse
at
her
heart
and
nothing
more
did
she
ever
mention
me
he
asked
hesitating
as
if
he
dreaded
the
answer
to
his
question
would
introduce
details
that
he
could
not
bear
to
hear
senses
never
returned
she
recognised
nobody
from
the
time
you
left
her
i
said
lies
with
a
sweet
smile
on
her
face
and
her
latest
ideas
wandered
back
to
pleasant
early
days
her
life
closed
in
a
gentle
dream
may
she
wake
as
kindly
in
the
other
world
she
wake
in
torment
he
cried
with
frightful
vehemence
stamping
his
foot
and
groaning
in
a
sudden
paroxysm
of
ungovernable
passion
she
a
liar
to
the
end
where
is
she
not
not
in
heaven
not
perished
where
oh
you
said
you
cared
nothing
for
my
sufferings
and
i
pray
one
prayer
i
repeat
it
till
my
tongue
stiffens
catherine
earnshaw
may
you
not
rest
as
long
as
i
am
living
you
said
i
killed
you
haunt
me
then
the
murdered
haunt
their
murderers
i
believe
i
know
that
ghosts
wandered
on
earth
be
with
me
always
take
any
form
drive
me
mad
only
not
leave
me
in
this
abyss
where
i
can
not
find
you
oh
god
it
is
unutterable
i
live
without
my
life
i
live
without
my
soul
he
dashed
his
head
against
the
knotted
trunk
and
lifting
up
his
eyes
howled
not
like
a
man
but
like
a
savage
beast
being
goaded
to
death
with
knives
and
spears
i
observed
several
splashes
of
blood
about
the
bark
of
the
tree
and
his
hand
and
forehead
were
both
stained
probably
the
scene
i
witnessed
was
a
repetition
of
others
acted
during
the
night
it
hardly
moved
my
compassion
it
appalled
me
still
i
felt
reluctant
to
quit
him
so
but
the
moment
he
recollected
himself
enough
to
notice
me
watching
he
thundered
a
command
for
me
to
go
and
i
obeyed
he
was
beyond
my
skill
to
quiet
or
console
linton
funeral
was
appointed
to
take
place
on
the
friday
following
her
decease
and
till
then
her
coffin
remained
uncovered
and
strewn
with
flowers
and
scented
leaves
in
the
great
linton
spent
his
days
and
nights
there
a
sleepless
guardian
and
a
circumstance
concealed
from
all
but
me
heathcliff
spent
his
nights
at
least
outside
equally
a
stranger
to
repose
i
held
no
communication
with
him
still
i
was
conscious
of
his
design
to
enter
if
he
could
and
on
the
tuesday
a
little
after
dark
when
my
master
from
sheer
fatigue
had
been
compelled
to
retire
a
couple
of
hours
i
went
and
opened
one
of
the
windows
moved
by
his
perseverance
to
give
him
a
chance
of
bestowing
on
the
faded
image
of
his
idol
one
final
adieu
he
did
not
omit
to
avail
himself
of
the
opportunity
cautiously
and
briefly
too
cautiously
to
betray
his
presence
by
the
slightest
noise
indeed
i
should
have
discovered
that
he
had
been
there
except
for
the
disarrangement
of
the
drapery
about
the
corpse
face
and
for
observing
on
the
floor
a
curl
of
light
hair
fastened
with
a
silver
thread
which
on
examination
i
ascertained
to
have
been
taken
from
a
locket
hung
round
catherine
neck
heathcliff
had
opened
the
trinket
and
cast
out
its
contents
replacing
them
by
a
black
lock
of
his
own
i
twisted
the
two
and
enclosed
them
together
earnshaw
was
of
course
invited
to
attend
the
remains
of
his
sister
to
the
grave
he
sent
no
excuse
but
he
never
came
so
that
besides
her
husband
the
mourners
were
wholly
composed
of
tenants
and
servants
isabella
was
not
asked
the
place
of
catherine
interment
to
the
surprise
of
the
villagers
was
neither
in
the
chapel
under
the
carved
monument
of
the
lintons
nor
yet
by
the
tombs
of
her
own
relations
outside
it
was
dug
on
a
green
slope
in
a
corner
of
the
where
the
wall
is
so
low
that
heath
and
have
climbed
over
it
from
the
moor
and
almost
buries
it
her
husband
lies
in
the
same
spot
now
and
they
have
each
a
simple
headstone
above
and
a
plain
grey
block
at
their
feet
to
mark
the
graves
chapter
xvii
that
friday
made
the
last
of
our
fine
days
for
a
month
in
the
evening
the
weather
broke
the
wind
shifted
from
south
to
and
brought
rain
first
and
then
sleet
and
snow
on
the
morrow
one
could
hardly
imagine
that
there
had
been
three
weeks
of
summer
the
primroses
and
crocuses
were
hidden
under
wintry
drifts
the
larks
were
silent
the
young
leaves
of
the
early
trees
smitten
and
blackened
and
dreary
and
chill
and
dismal
that
morrow
did
creep
over
my
master
kept
his
room
i
took
possession
of
the
lonely
parlour
converting
it
into
a
nursery
and
there
i
was
sitting
with
the
moaning
doll
of
a
child
laid
on
my
knee
rocking
it
to
and
fro
and
watching
meanwhile
the
still
driving
flakes
build
up
the
uncurtained
window
when
the
door
opened
and
some
person
entered
out
of
breath
and
laughing
my
anger
was
greater
than
my
astonishment
for
a
minute
i
supposed
it
one
of
the
maids
and
i
cried
done
how
dare
you
show
your
giddiness
here
what
would
linton
say
if
he
heard
you
me
answered
a
familiar
voice
i
know
edgar
is
in
bed
and
i
can
not
stop
myself
with
that
the
speaker
came
forward
to
the
fire
panting
and
holding
her
hand
to
her
side
have
run
the
whole
way
from
wuthering
heights
she
continued
after
a
pause
where
i
flown
i
could
count
the
number
of
falls
i
had
oh
i
aching
all
over
do
be
alarmed
there
shall
be
an
explanation
as
soon
as
i
can
give
it
only
just
have
the
goodness
to
step
out
and
order
the
carriage
to
take
me
on
to
gimmerton
and
tell
a
servant
to
seek
up
a
few
clothes
in
my
wardrobe
the
intruder
was
heathcliff
she
certainly
seemed
in
no
laughing
predicament
her
hair
streamed
on
her
shoulders
dripping
with
snow
and
water
she
was
dressed
in
the
girlish
dress
she
commonly
wore
befitting
her
age
more
than
her
position
a
low
frock
with
short
sleeves
and
nothing
on
either
head
or
neck
the
frock
was
of
light
silk
and
clung
to
her
with
wet
and
her
feet
were
protected
merely
by
thin
slippers
add
to
this
a
deep
cut
under
one
ear
which
only
the
cold
prevented
from
bleeding
profusely
a
white
face
scratched
and
bruised
and
a
frame
hardly
able
to
support
itself
through
fatigue
and
you
may
fancy
my
first
fright
was
not
much
allayed
when
i
had
had
leisure
to
examine
her
dear
young
lady
i
exclaimed
stir
nowhere
and
hear
nothing
till
you
have
removed
every
article
of
your
clothes
and
put
on
dry
things
and
certainly
you
shall
not
go
to
gimmerton
so
it
is
needless
to
order
the
carriage
i
shall
she
said
or
riding
yet
i
no
objection
to
dress
myself
decently
and
ah
see
how
it
flows
down
my
neck
now
the
fire
does
make
it
smart
she
insisted
on
my
fulfilling
her
directions
before
she
would
let
me
touch
her
and
not
till
after
the
coachman
had
been
instructed
to
get
ready
and
a
maid
set
to
pack
up
some
necessary
attire
did
i
obtain
her
consent
for
binding
the
wound
and
helping
to
change
her
garments
ellen
she
said
when
my
task
was
finished
and
she
was
seated
in
an
on
the
hearth
with
a
cup
of
tea
before
her
sit
down
opposite
me
and
put
poor
catherine
baby
away
i
do
like
to
see
it
you
must
think
i
care
little
for
catherine
because
i
behaved
so
foolishly
on
entering
i
cried
too
bitterly
yes
more
than
any
one
else
has
reason
to
cry
we
parted
unreconciled
you
remember
and
i
forgive
myself
but
for
all
that
i
was
not
going
to
sympathise
with
him
the
brute
beast
oh
give
me
the
poker
this
is
the
last
thing
of
his
i
have
about
me
she
slipped
the
gold
ring
from
her
third
finger
and
threw
it
on
the
floor
smash
it
she
continued
striking
it
with
childish
spite
then
i
burn
it
and
she
took
and
dropped
the
misused
article
among
the
coals
he
shall
buy
another
if
he
gets
me
back
again
he
be
capable
of
coming
to
seek
me
to
tease
edgar
i
dare
not
stay
lest
that
notion
should
possess
his
wicked
head
and
besides
edgar
has
not
been
kind
has
he
and
i
come
suing
for
his
assistance
nor
will
i
bring
him
into
more
trouble
necessity
compelled
me
to
seek
shelter
here
though
if
i
had
not
learned
he
was
out
of
the
way
i
have
halted
at
the
kitchen
washed
my
face
warmed
myself
got
you
to
bring
what
i
wanted
and
departed
again
to
anywhere
out
of
the
reach
of
my
accursed
of
that
incarnate
goblin
ah
he
was
in
such
a
fury
if
he
had
caught
me
it
a
pity
earnshaw
is
not
his
match
in
strength
i
would
have
run
till
i
seen
him
all
but
demolished
had
hindley
been
able
to
do
it
do
talk
so
fast
miss
i
interrupted
disorder
the
handkerchief
i
have
tied
round
your
face
and
make
the
cut
bleed
again
drink
your
tea
and
take
breath
and
give
over
laughing
laughter
is
sadly
out
of
place
under
this
roof
and
in
your
condition
undeniable
truth
she
replied
to
that
child
it
maintains
a
constant
wail
send
it
out
of
my
hearing
for
an
hour
i
stay
any
longer
i
rang
the
bell
and
committed
it
to
a
servant
care
and
then
i
inquired
what
had
urged
her
to
escape
from
wuthering
heights
in
such
an
unlikely
plight
and
where
she
meant
to
go
as
she
refused
remaining
with
us
ought
and
i
wished
to
remain
answered
she
cheer
edgar
and
take
care
of
the
baby
for
two
things
and
because
the
grange
is
my
right
home
but
i
tell
you
he
would
let
me
do
you
think
he
could
bear
to
see
me
grow
fat
and
merry
could
bear
to
think
that
we
were
tranquil
and
not
resolve
on
poisoning
our
comfort
now
i
have
the
satisfaction
of
being
sure
that
he
detests
me
to
the
point
of
its
annoying
him
seriously
to
have
me
within
or
eyesight
i
notice
when
i
enter
his
presence
the
muscles
of
his
countenance
are
involuntarily
distorted
into
an
expression
of
hatred
partly
arising
from
his
knowledge
of
the
good
causes
i
have
to
feel
that
sentiment
for
him
and
partly
from
original
aversion
it
is
strong
enough
to
make
me
feel
pretty
certain
that
he
would
not
chase
me
over
england
supposing
i
contrived
a
clear
escape
and
therefore
i
must
get
quite
away
i
recovered
from
my
first
desire
to
be
killed
by
him
i
rather
he
kill
himself
he
has
extinguished
my
love
effectually
and
so
i
at
my
ease
i
can
recollect
yet
how
i
loved
him
and
can
dimly
imagine
that
i
could
still
be
loving
him
if
no
no
even
if
he
had
doted
on
me
the
devilish
nature
would
have
revealed
its
existence
somehow
catherine
had
an
awfully
perverted
taste
to
esteem
him
so
dearly
knowing
him
so
well
monster
would
that
he
could
be
blotted
out
of
creation
and
out
of
my
memory
hush
he
a
human
being
i
said
more
charitable
there
are
worse
men
than
he
is
yet
not
a
human
being
she
retorted
he
has
no
claim
on
my
charity
i
gave
him
my
heart
and
he
took
and
pinched
it
to
death
and
flung
it
back
to
me
people
feel
with
their
hearts
ellen
and
since
he
has
destroyed
mine
i
have
not
power
to
feel
for
him
and
i
would
not
though
he
groaned
from
this
to
his
dying
day
and
wept
tears
of
blood
for
catherine
no
indeed
indeed
i
would
and
here
isabella
began
to
cry
but
immediately
dashing
the
water
from
her
lashes
she
recommenced
asked
what
has
driven
me
to
flight
at
last
i
was
compelled
to
attempt
it
because
i
had
succeeded
in
rousing
his
rage
a
pitch
above
his
malignity
pulling
out
the
nerves
with
red
hot
pincers
requires
more
coolness
than
knocking
on
the
head
he
was
worked
up
to
forget
the
fiendish
prudence
he
boasted
of
and
proceeded
to
murderous
violence
i
experienced
pleasure
in
being
able
to
exasperate
him
the
sense
of
pleasure
woke
my
instinct
of
so
i
fairly
broke
free
and
if
ever
i
come
into
his
hands
again
he
is
welcome
to
a
signal
revenge
you
know
earnshaw
should
have
been
at
the
funeral
he
kept
himself
sober
for
the
purpose
tolerably
sober
not
going
to
bed
mad
at
six
and
getting
up
drunk
at
twelve
consequently
he
rose
in
suicidal
low
spirits
as
fit
for
the
church
as
for
a
dance
and
instead
he
sat
down
by
the
fire
and
swallowed
gin
or
brandy
by
tumblerfuls
i
shudder
to
name
him
has
been
a
stranger
in
the
house
from
last
sunday
till
whether
the
angels
have
fed
him
or
his
kin
beneath
i
can
not
tell
but
he
has
not
eaten
a
meal
with
us
for
nearly
a
week
he
has
just
come
home
at
dawn
and
gone
to
his
chamber
locking
himself
in
as
if
anybody
dreamt
of
coveting
his
company
there
he
has
continued
praying
like
a
methodist
only
the
deity
he
implored
is
senseless
dust
and
ashes
and
god
when
addressed
was
curiously
confounded
with
his
own
black
father
after
concluding
these
precious
orisons
and
they
lasted
generally
till
he
grew
hoarse
and
his
voice
was
strangled
in
his
throat
he
would
be
off
again
always
straight
down
to
the
grange
i
wonder
edgar
did
not
send
for
a
constable
and
give
him
into
custody
for
me
grieved
as
i
was
about
catherine
it
was
impossible
to
avoid
regarding
this
season
of
deliverance
from
degrading
oppression
as
a
holiday
recovered
spirits
sufficient
to
bear
joseph
eternal
lectures
without
weeping
and
to
move
up
and
down
the
house
less
with
the
foot
of
a
frightened
thief
than
formerly
you
would
think
that
i
should
cry
at
anything
joseph
could
say
but
he
and
hareton
are
detestable
companions
i
rather
sit
with
hindley
and
hear
his
awful
talk
than
with
little
maister
and
his
staunch
supporter
that
odious
old
man
when
heathcliff
is
in
i
often
obliged
to
seek
the
kitchen
and
their
society
or
starve
among
the
damp
uninhabited
chambers
when
he
is
not
as
was
the
case
this
week
i
establish
a
table
and
chair
at
one
corner
of
the
house
fire
and
never
mind
how
earnshaw
may
occupy
himself
and
he
does
not
interfere
with
my
arrangements
he
is
quieter
now
than
he
used
to
be
if
no
one
provokes
him
more
sullen
and
depressed
and
less
furious
joseph
affirms
he
sure
he
an
altered
man
that
the
lord
has
touched
his
heart
and
he
is
saved
so
as
by
fire
i
puzzled
to
detect
signs
of
the
favourable
change
but
it
is
not
my
business
i
sat
in
my
nook
reading
some
old
books
till
late
on
towards
twelve
it
seemed
so
dismal
to
go
with
the
wild
snow
blowing
outside
and
my
thoughts
continually
reverting
to
the
and
the
grave
i
dared
hardly
lift
my
eyes
from
the
page
before
me
that
melancholy
scene
so
instantly
usurped
its
place
hindley
sat
opposite
his
head
leant
on
his
hand
perhaps
meditating
on
the
same
subject
he
had
ceased
drinking
at
a
point
below
irrationality
and
had
neither
stirred
nor
spoken
during
two
or
three
hours
there
was
no
sound
through
the
house
but
the
moaning
wind
which
shook
the
windows
every
now
and
then
the
faint
crackling
of
the
coals
and
the
click
of
my
snuffers
as
i
removed
at
intervals
the
long
wick
of
the
candle
hareton
and
joseph
were
probably
fast
asleep
in
bed
it
was
very
very
sad
and
while
i
read
i
sighed
for
it
seemed
as
if
all
joy
had
vanished
from
the
world
never
to
be
restored
doleful
silence
was
broken
at
length
by
the
sound
of
the
kitchen
latch
heathcliff
had
returned
from
his
watch
earlier
than
usual
owing
i
suppose
to
the
sudden
storm
that
entrance
was
fastened
and
we
heard
him
coming
round
to
get
in
by
the
other
i
rose
with
an
irrepressible
expression
of
what
i
felt
on
my
lips
which
induced
my
companion
who
had
been
staring
towards
the
door
to
turn
and
look
at
me
i
keep
him
out
five
minutes
he
exclaimed
you
wo
object
no
you
may
keep
him
out
the
whole
night
for
me
i
answered
do
put
the
key
in
the
lock
and
draw
the
bolts
accomplished
this
ere
his
guest
reached
the
front
he
then
came
and
brought
his
chair
to
the
other
side
of
my
table
leaning
over
it
and
searching
in
my
eyes
for
a
sympathy
with
the
burning
hate
that
gleamed
from
his
as
he
both
looked
and
felt
like
an
assassin
he
exactly
find
that
but
he
discovered
enough
to
encourage
him
to
speak
you
and
i
he
said
have
each
a
great
debt
to
settle
with
the
man
out
yonder
if
we
were
neither
of
us
cowards
we
might
combine
to
discharge
it
are
you
as
soft
as
your
brother
are
you
willing
to
endure
to
the
last
and
not
once
attempt
a
repayment
i
weary
of
enduring
now
i
replied
and
i
be
glad
of
a
retaliation
that
would
recoil
on
myself
but
treachery
and
violence
are
spears
pointed
at
both
ends
they
wound
those
who
resort
to
them
worse
than
their
enemies
treachery
and
violence
are
a
just
return
for
treachery
and
violence
cried
hindley
heathcliff
i
ask
you
to
do
nothing
but
sit
still
and
be
dumb
tell
me
now
can
you
i
sure
you
would
have
as
much
pleasure
as
i
in
witnessing
the
conclusion
of
the
fiend
existence
he
be
death
unless
you
overreach
him
and
he
be
ruin
damn
the
hellish
villain
he
knocks
at
the
door
as
if
he
were
master
here
already
promise
to
hold
your
tongue
and
before
that
clock
strikes
it
wants
three
minutes
of
one
you
a
free
woman
took
the
implements
which
i
described
to
you
in
my
letter
from
his
breast
and
would
have
turned
down
the
candle
i
snatched
it
away
however
and
seized
his
arm
i
not
hold
my
tongue
i
said
you
must
touch
him
let
the
door
remain
shut
and
be
quiet
no
i
formed
my
resolution
and
by
god
i
execute
it
cried
the
desperate
being
i
do
you
a
kindness
in
spite
of
yourself
and
hareton
justice
and
you
need
trouble
your
head
to
screen
me
catherine
is
gone
nobody
alive
would
regret
me
or
be
ashamed
though
i
cut
my
throat
this
minute
and
it
time
to
make
an
end
might
as
well
have
struggled
with
a
bear
or
reasoned
with
a
lunatic
the
only
resource
left
me
was
to
run
to
a
lattice
and
warn
his
intended
victim
of
the
fate
which
awaited
him
you
better
seek
shelter
somewhere
else
i
exclaimed
in
rather
a
triumphant
tone
earnshaw
has
a
mind
to
shoot
you
if
you
persist
in
endeavouring
to
enter
you
better
open
the
door
you
he
answered
addressing
me
by
some
elegant
term
that
i
do
care
to
repeat
i
shall
not
meddle
in
the
matter
i
retorted
again
come
in
and
get
shot
if
you
please
i
done
my
duty
that
i
shut
the
window
and
returned
to
my
place
by
the
fire
having
too
small
a
stock
of
hypocrisy
at
my
command
to
pretend
any
anxiety
for
the
danger
that
menaced
him
earnshaw
swore
passionately
at
me
affirming
that
i
loved
the
villain
yet
and
calling
me
all
sorts
of
names
for
the
base
spirit
i
evinced
and
i
in
my
secret
heart
and
conscience
never
reproached
me
thought
what
a
blessing
it
would
be
for
should
heathcliff
put
him
out
of
misery
and
what
a
blessing
for
should
he
send
heathcliff
to
his
right
abode
as
i
sat
nursing
these
reflections
the
casement
behind
me
was
banged
on
to
the
floor
by
a
blow
from
the
latter
individual
and
his
black
countenance
looked
blightingly
through
the
stanchions
stood
too
close
to
suffer
his
shoulders
to
follow
and
i
smiled
exulting
in
my
fancied
security
his
hair
and
clothes
were
whitened
with
snow
and
his
sharp
cannibal
teeth
revealed
by
cold
and
wrath
gleamed
through
the
dark
isabella
let
me
in
or
i
make
you
repent
he
girned
as
joseph
calls
it
i
can
not
commit
murder
i
replied
hindley
stands
sentinel
with
a
knife
and
loaded
pistol
let
me
in
by
the
kitchen
door
he
said
hindley
will
be
there
before
me
i
answered
and
that
a
poor
love
of
yours
that
can
not
bear
a
shower
of
snow
we
were
left
at
peace
in
our
beds
as
long
as
the
summer
moon
shone
but
the
moment
a
blast
of
winter
returns
you
must
run
for
shelter
heathcliff
if
i
were
you
i
go
stretch
myself
over
her
grave
and
die
like
a
faithful
dog
the
world
is
surely
not
worth
living
in
now
is
it
you
had
distinctly
impressed
on
me
the
idea
that
catherine
was
the
whole
joy
of
your
life
i
imagine
how
you
think
of
surviving
her
loss
he
there
is
he
exclaimed
my
companion
rushing
to
the
gap
if
i
can
get
my
arm
out
i
can
hit
him
afraid
ellen
you
set
me
down
as
really
wicked
but
you
know
all
so
do
judge
i
would
have
aided
or
abetted
an
attempt
on
even
life
for
anything
wish
that
he
were
dead
i
must
and
therefore
i
was
fearfully
disappointed
and
unnerved
by
terror
for
the
consequences
of
my
taunting
speech
when
he
flung
himself
on
weapon
and
wrenched
it
from
his
grasp
charge
exploded
and
the
knife
in
springing
back
closed
into
its
owner
wrist
heathcliff
pulled
it
away
by
main
force
slitting
up
the
flesh
as
it
passed
on
and
thrust
it
dripping
into
his
pocket
he
then
took
a
stone
struck
down
the
division
between
two
windows
and
sprang
in
his
adversary
had
fallen
senseless
with
excessive
pain
and
the
flow
of
blood
that
gushed
from
an
artery
or
a
large
vein
the
ruffian
kicked
and
trampled
on
him
and
dashed
his
head
repeatedly
against
the
flags
holding
me
with
one
hand
meantime
to
prevent
me
summoning
joseph
he
exerted
preterhuman
in
abstaining
from
finishing
him
completely
but
getting
out
of
breath
he
finally
desisted
and
dragged
the
apparently
inanimate
body
on
to
the
settle
there
he
tore
off
the
sleeve
of
earnshaw
coat
and
bound
up
the
wound
with
brutal
roughness
spitting
and
cursing
during
the
operation
as
energetically
as
he
had
kicked
before
being
at
liberty
i
lost
no
time
in
seeking
the
old
servant
who
having
gathered
by
degrees
the
purport
of
my
hasty
tale
hurried
below
gasping
as
he
descended
the
steps
two
at
once
what
is
ther
to
do
now
what
is
ther
to
do
now
there
this
to
do
thundered
heathcliff
that
your
master
mad
and
should
he
last
another
month
i
have
him
to
an
asylum
and
how
the
devil
did
you
come
to
fasten
me
out
you
toothless
hound
do
stand
muttering
and
mumbling
there
come
i
not
going
to
nurse
him
wash
that
stuff
away
and
mind
the
sparks
of
your
candle
it
is
more
than
half
brandy
and
so
ye
been
murthering
on
him
exclaimed
joseph
lifting
his
hands
and
eyes
in
horror
if
iver
i
seed
a
seeght
loike
this
may
the
lord
gave
him
a
push
on
to
his
knees
in
the
middle
of
the
blood
and
flung
a
towel
to
him
but
instead
of
proceeding
to
dry
it
up
he
joined
his
hands
and
began
a
prayer
which
excited
my
laughter
from
its
odd
phraseology
i
was
in
the
condition
of
mind
to
be
shocked
at
nothing
in
fact
i
was
as
reckless
as
some
malefactors
show
themselves
at
the
foot
of
the
gallows
oh
i
forgot
you
said
the
tyrant
you
shall
do
that
down
with
you
and
you
conspire
with
him
against
me
do
you
viper
there
that
is
work
fit
for
you
shook
me
till
my
teeth
rattled
and
pitched
me
beside
joseph
who
steadily
concluded
his
supplications
and
then
rose
vowing
he
would
set
off
for
the
grange
directly
linton
was
a
magistrate
and
though
he
had
fifty
wives
dead
he
should
inquire
into
this
he
was
so
obstinate
in
his
resolution
that
heathcliff
deemed
it
expedient
to
compel
from
my
lips
a
recapitulation
of
what
had
taken
place
standing
over
me
heaving
with
malevolence
as
i
reluctantly
delivered
the
account
in
answer
to
his
questions
it
required
a
great
deal
of
labour
to
satisfy
the
old
man
that
heathcliff
was
not
the
aggressor
especially
with
my
replies
however
earnshaw
soon
convinced
him
that
he
was
alive
still
joseph
hastened
to
administer
a
dose
of
spirits
and
by
their
succour
his
master
presently
regained
motion
and
consciousness
heathcliff
aware
that
his
opponent
was
ignorant
of
the
treatment
received
while
insensible
called
him
deliriously
intoxicated
and
said
he
should
not
notice
his
atrocious
conduct
further
but
advised
him
to
get
to
bed
to
my
joy
he
left
us
after
giving
this
judicious
counsel
and
hindley
stretched
himself
on
the
hearthstone
i
departed
to
my
own
room
marvelling
that
i
had
escaped
so
easily
morning
when
i
came
down
about
half
an
hour
before
noon
earnshaw
was
sitting
by
the
fire
deadly
sick
his
evil
genius
almost
as
gaunt
and
ghastly
leant
against
the
chimney
neither
appeared
inclined
to
dine
and
having
waited
till
all
was
cold
on
the
table
i
commenced
alone
nothing
hindered
me
from
eating
heartily
and
i
experienced
a
certain
sense
of
satisfaction
and
superiority
as
at
intervals
i
cast
a
look
towards
my
silent
companions
and
felt
the
comfort
of
a
quiet
conscience
within
me
after
i
had
done
i
ventured
on
the
unusual
liberty
of
drawing
near
the
fire
going
round
earnshaw
seat
and
kneeling
in
the
corner
beside
him
did
not
glance
my
way
and
i
gazed
up
and
contemplated
his
features
almost
as
confidently
as
if
they
had
been
turned
to
stone
his
forehead
that
i
once
thought
so
manly
and
that
i
now
think
so
diabolical
was
shaded
with
a
heavy
cloud
his
basilisk
eyes
were
nearly
quenched
by
sleeplessness
and
weeping
perhaps
for
the
lashes
were
wet
then
his
lips
devoid
of
their
ferocious
sneer
and
sealed
in
an
expression
of
unspeakable
sadness
had
it
been
another
i
would
have
covered
my
face
in
the
presence
of
such
grief
in
case
i
was
gratified
and
ignoble
as
it
seems
to
insult
a
fallen
enemy
i
miss
this
chance
of
sticking
in
a
dart
his
weakness
was
the
only
time
when
i
could
taste
the
delight
of
paying
wrong
for
wrong
fie
miss
i
interrupted
might
suppose
you
had
never
opened
a
bible
in
your
life
if
god
afflict
your
enemies
surely
that
ought
to
suffice
you
it
is
both
mean
and
presumptuous
to
add
your
torture
to
his
general
i
allow
that
it
would
be
ellen
she
continued
what
misery
laid
on
heathcliff
could
content
me
unless
i
have
a
hand
in
it
i
rather
he
suffered
less
if
i
might
cause
his
sufferings
and
he
might
that
i
was
the
cause
oh
i
owe
him
so
much
on
only
one
condition
can
i
hope
to
forgive
him
it
is
if
i
may
take
an
eye
for
an
eye
a
tooth
for
a
tooth
for
every
wrench
of
agony
return
a
wrench
reduce
him
to
my
level
as
he
was
the
first
to
injure
make
him
the
first
to
implore
pardon
and
then
why
then
ellen
i
might
show
you
some
generosity
but
it
is
utterly
impossible
i
can
ever
be
revenged
and
therefore
i
can
not
forgive
him
hindley
wanted
some
water
and
i
handed
him
a
glass
and
asked
him
how
he
was
not
as
ill
as
i
wish
he
replied
but
leaving
out
my
arm
every
inch
of
me
is
as
sore
as
if
i
had
been
fighting
with
a
legion
of
imps
yes
no
wonder
was
my
next
remark
catherine
used
to
boast
that
she
stood
between
you
and
bodily
harm
she
meant
that
certain
persons
would
not
hurt
you
for
fear
of
offending
her
it
well
people
do
rise
from
their
grave
or
last
night
she
might
have
witnessed
a
repulsive
scene
are
not
you
bruised
and
cut
over
your
chest
and
shoulders
i
ca
say
he
answered
but
what
do
you
mean
did
he
dare
to
strike
me
when
i
was
down
he
trampled
on
and
kicked
you
and
dashed
you
on
the
ground
i
whispered
and
his
mouth
watered
to
tear
you
with
his
teeth
because
he
only
half
man
not
so
much
and
the
rest
fiend
earnshaw
looked
up
like
me
to
the
countenance
of
our
mutual
foe
who
absorbed
in
his
anguish
seemed
insensible
to
anything
around
him
the
longer
he
stood
the
plainer
his
reflections
revealed
their
blackness
through
his
features
oh
if
god
would
but
give
me
strength
to
strangle
him
in
my
last
agony
i
go
to
hell
with
joy
groaned
the
impatient
man
writhing
to
rise
and
sinking
back
in
despair
convinced
of
his
inadequacy
for
the
struggle
nay
it
enough
that
he
has
murdered
one
of
you
i
observed
aloud
at
the
grange
every
one
knows
your
sister
would
have
been
living
now
had
it
not
been
for
heathcliff
after
all
it
is
preferable
to
be
hated
than
loved
by
him
when
i
recollect
how
happy
we
were
how
happy
catherine
was
before
he
came
i
fit
to
curse
the
day
likely
heathcliff
noticed
more
the
truth
of
what
was
said
than
the
spirit
of
the
person
who
said
it
his
attention
was
roused
i
saw
for
his
eyes
rained
down
tears
among
the
ashes
and
he
drew
his
breath
in
suffocating
sighs
i
stared
full
at
him
and
laughed
scornfully
the
clouded
windows
of
hell
flashed
a
moment
towards
me
the
fiend
which
usually
looked
out
however
was
so
dimmed
and
drowned
that
i
did
not
fear
to
hazard
another
sound
of
derision
get
up
and
begone
out
of
my
sight
said
the
mourner
guessed
he
uttered
those
words
at
least
though
his
voice
was
hardly
intelligible
i
beg
your
pardon
i
replied
but
i
loved
catherine
too
and
her
brother
requires
attendance
which
for
her
sake
i
shall
supply
now
that
she
dead
i
see
her
in
hindley
hindley
has
exactly
her
eyes
if
you
had
not
tried
to
gouge
them
out
and
made
them
black
and
red
and
her
get
up
wretched
idiot
before
i
stamp
you
to
death
he
cried
making
a
movement
that
caused
me
to
make
one
also
but
then
i
continued
holding
myself
ready
to
flee
if
poor
catherine
had
trusted
you
and
assumed
the
ridiculous
contemptible
degrading
title
of
heathcliff
she
would
soon
have
presented
a
similar
picture
would
have
borne
your
abominable
behaviour
quietly
her
detestation
and
disgust
must
have
found
voice
back
of
the
settle
and
earnshaw
person
interposed
between
me
and
him
so
instead
of
endeavouring
to
reach
me
he
snatched
a
from
the
table
and
flung
it
at
my
head
it
struck
beneath
my
ear
and
stopped
the
sentence
i
was
uttering
but
pulling
it
out
i
sprang
to
the
door
and
delivered
another
which
i
hope
went
a
little
deeper
than
his
missile
the
last
glimpse
i
caught
of
him
was
a
furious
rush
on
his
part
checked
by
the
embrace
of
his
host
and
both
fell
locked
together
on
the
hearth
in
my
flight
through
the
kitchen
i
bid
joseph
speed
to
his
master
i
knocked
over
hareton
who
was
hanging
a
litter
of
puppies
from
a
in
the
doorway
and
blessed
as
a
soul
escaped
from
purgatory
i
bounded
leaped
and
flew
down
the
steep
road
then
quitting
its
windings
shot
direct
across
the
moor
rolling
over
banks
and
wading
through
marshes
precipitating
myself
in
fact
towards
the
of
the
grange
and
far
rather
would
i
be
condemned
to
a
perpetual
dwelling
in
the
infernal
regions
than
even
for
one
night
abide
beneath
the
roof
of
wuthering
heights
again
isabella
ceased
speaking
and
took
a
drink
of
tea
then
she
rose
and
bidding
me
put
on
her
bonnet
and
a
great
shawl
i
had
brought
and
turning
a
deaf
ear
to
my
entreaties
for
her
to
remain
another
hour
she
stepped
on
to
a
chair
kissed
edgar
and
catherine
portraits
bestowed
a
similar
salute
on
me
and
descended
to
the
carriage
accompanied
by
fanny
who
yelped
wild
with
joy
at
recovering
her
mistress
she
was
driven
away
never
to
revisit
this
neighbourhood
but
a
regular
correspondence
was
established
between
her
and
my
master
when
things
were
more
settled
i
believe
her
new
abode
was
in
the
south
near
london
there
she
had
a
son
born
a
few
months
subsequent
to
her
escape
he
was
christened
linton
and
from
the
first
she
reported
him
to
be
an
ailing
peevish
creature
heathcliff
meeting
me
one
day
in
the
village
inquired
where
she
lived
i
refused
to
tell
he
remarked
that
it
was
not
of
any
moment
only
she
must
beware
of
coming
to
her
brother
she
should
not
be
with
him
if
he
had
to
keep
her
himself
though
i
would
give
no
information
he
discovered
through
some
of
the
other
servants
both
her
place
of
residence
and
the
existence
of
the
child
still
he
did
molest
her
for
which
forbearance
she
might
thank
his
aversion
i
suppose
he
often
asked
about
the
infant
when
he
saw
me
and
on
hearing
its
name
smiled
grimly
and
observed
wish
me
to
hate
it
too
do
they
do
think
they
wish
you
to
know
anything
about
it
i
answered
i
have
it
he
said
i
want
it
they
may
reckon
on
that
fortunately
its
mother
died
before
the
time
arrived
some
thirteen
years
after
the
decease
of
catherine
when
linton
was
twelve
or
a
little
more
on
the
day
succeeding
isabella
unexpected
visit
i
had
no
opportunity
of
speaking
to
my
master
he
shunned
conversation
and
was
fit
for
discussing
nothing
when
i
could
get
him
to
listen
i
saw
it
pleased
him
that
his
sister
had
left
her
husband
whom
he
abhorred
with
an
intensity
which
the
mildness
of
his
nature
would
scarcely
seem
to
allow
so
deep
and
sensitive
was
his
aversion
that
he
refrained
from
going
anywhere
where
he
was
likely
to
see
or
hear
of
heathcliff
grief
and
that
together
transformed
him
into
a
complete
hermit
he
threw
up
his
office
of
magistrate
ceased
even
to
attend
church
avoided
the
village
on
all
occasions
and
spent
a
life
of
entire
seclusion
within
the
limits
of
his
park
and
grounds
only
varied
by
solitary
rambles
on
the
moors
and
visits
to
the
grave
of
his
wife
mostly
at
evening
or
early
morning
before
other
wanderers
were
abroad
but
he
was
too
good
to
be
thoroughly
unhappy
long
did
pray
for
catherine
soul
to
haunt
him
time
brought
resignation
and
a
melancholy
sweeter
than
common
joy
he
recalled
her
memory
with
ardent
tender
love
and
hopeful
aspiring
to
the
better
world
where
he
doubted
not
she
was
gone
and
he
had
earthly
consolation
and
affections
also
for
a
few
days
i
said
he
seemed
regardless
of
the
puny
successor
to
the
departed
that
coldness
melted
as
fast
as
snow
in
april
and
ere
the
tiny
thing
could
stammer
a
word
or
totter
a
step
it
wielded
a
despot
sceptre
in
his
heart
it
was
named
catherine
but
he
never
called
it
the
name
in
full
as
he
had
never
called
the
first
catherine
short
probably
because
heathcliff
had
a
habit
of
doing
so
the
little
one
was
always
cathy
it
formed
to
him
a
distinction
from
the
mother
and
yet
a
connection
with
her
and
his
attachment
sprang
from
its
relation
to
her
far
more
than
from
its
being
his
own
i
used
to
draw
a
comparison
between
him
and
hindley
earnshaw
and
perplex
myself
to
explain
satisfactorily
why
their
conduct
was
so
opposite
in
similar
circumstances
they
had
both
been
fond
husbands
and
were
both
attached
to
their
children
and
i
could
not
see
how
they
should
both
have
taken
the
same
road
for
good
or
evil
but
i
thought
in
my
mind
hindley
with
apparently
the
stronger
head
has
shown
himself
sadly
the
worse
and
the
weaker
man
when
his
ship
struck
the
captain
abandoned
his
post
and
the
crew
instead
of
trying
to
save
her
rushed
into
riot
and
confusion
leaving
no
hope
for
their
luckless
vessel
linton
on
the
contrary
displayed
the
true
courage
of
a
loyal
and
faithful
soul
he
trusted
god
and
god
comforted
him
one
hoped
and
the
other
despaired
they
chose
their
own
lots
and
were
righteously
doomed
to
endure
them
but
you
not
want
to
hear
my
moralising
lockwood
you
judge
as
well
as
i
can
all
these
things
at
least
you
think
you
will
and
that
the
same
the
end
of
earnshaw
was
what
might
have
been
expected
it
followed
fast
on
his
sister
there
were
scarcely
six
months
between
them
we
at
the
grange
never
got
a
very
succinct
account
of
his
state
preceding
it
all
that
i
did
learn
was
on
occasion
of
going
to
aid
in
the
preparations
for
the
funeral
kenneth
came
to
announce
the
event
to
my
master
nelly
said
he
riding
into
the
yard
one
morning
too
early
not
to
alarm
me
with
an
instant
presentiment
of
bad
news
yours
and
my
turn
to
go
into
mourning
at
present
who
given
us
the
slip
now
do
you
think
i
asked
in
a
flurry
guess
he
returned
dismounting
and
slinging
his
bridle
on
a
hook
by
the
door
nip
up
the
corner
of
your
apron
i
certain
need
it
heathcliff
surely
i
exclaimed
would
you
have
tears
for
him
said
the
doctor
a
tough
young
fellow
he
looks
blooming
i
just
seen
him
rapidly
regaining
flesh
since
he
lost
his
better
half
is
it
then
mr
kenneth
i
repeated
impatiently
earnshaw
your
old
friend
hindley
he
replied
my
wicked
gossip
though
he
been
too
wild
for
me
this
long
while
there
i
said
we
should
draw
water
but
cheer
up
he
died
true
to
his
character
drunk
as
a
lord
poor
lad
i
sorry
too
one
ca
help
missing
an
old
companion
though
he
had
the
worst
tricks
with
him
that
ever
man
imagined
and
has
done
me
many
a
rascally
turn
he
barely
it
seems
that
your
own
age
who
would
have
thought
you
were
born
in
one
year
i
confess
this
blow
was
greater
to
me
than
the
shock
of
death
ancient
associations
lingered
round
my
heart
i
sat
down
in
the
porch
and
wept
as
for
a
blood
relation
desiring
kenneth
to
get
another
servant
to
introduce
him
to
the
master
i
could
not
hinder
myself
from
pondering
on
the
question
he
had
fair
play
whatever
i
did
that
idea
would
bother
me
it
was
so
tiresomely
pertinacious
that
i
resolved
on
requesting
leave
to
go
to
wuthering
heights
and
assist
in
the
last
duties
to
the
dead
linton
was
extremely
reluctant
to
consent
but
i
pleaded
eloquently
for
the
friendless
condition
in
which
he
lay
and
i
said
my
old
master
and
had
a
claim
on
my
services
as
strong
as
his
own
besides
i
reminded
him
that
the
child
hareton
was
his
wife
nephew
and
in
the
absence
of
nearer
kin
he
ought
to
act
as
its
guardian
and
he
ought
to
and
must
inquire
how
the
property
was
left
and
look
over
the
concerns
of
his
he
was
unfit
for
attending
to
such
matters
then
but
he
bid
me
speak
to
his
lawyer
and
at
length
permitted
me
to
go
his
lawyer
had
been
also
i
called
at
the
village
and
asked
him
to
accompany
me
he
shook
his
head
and
advised
that
heathcliff
should
be
let
alone
affirming
if
the
truth
were
known
hareton
would
be
found
little
else
than
a
beggar
father
died
in
debt
he
said
whole
property
is
mortgaged
and
the
sole
chance
for
the
natural
heir
is
to
allow
him
an
opportunity
of
creating
some
interest
in
the
creditor
heart
that
he
may
be
inclined
to
deal
leniently
towards
him
when
i
reached
the
heights
i
explained
that
i
had
come
to
see
everything
carried
on
decently
and
joseph
who
appeared
in
sufficient
distress
expressed
satisfaction
at
my
presence
heathcliff
said
he
did
not
perceive
that
i
was
wanted
but
i
might
stay
and
order
the
arrangements
for
the
funeral
if
i
chose
he
remarked
fool
body
should
be
buried
at
the
without
ceremony
of
any
kind
i
happened
to
leave
him
ten
minutes
yesterday
afternoon
and
in
that
interval
he
fastened
the
two
doors
of
the
house
against
me
and
he
has
spent
the
night
in
drinking
himself
to
death
deliberately
we
broke
in
this
morning
for
we
heard
him
sporting
like
a
horse
and
there
he
was
laid
over
the
settle
flaying
and
scalping
would
not
have
wakened
him
i
sent
for
kenneth
and
he
came
but
not
till
the
beast
had
changed
into
carrion
he
was
both
dead
and
cold
and
stark
and
so
you
allow
it
was
useless
making
more
stir
about
him
the
old
servant
confirmed
this
statement
but
muttered
rayther
he
goan
hisseln
for
t
doctor
i
sud
ha
taen
tent
o
maister
better
nor
him
and
he
war
deead
when
i
left
naught
o
soart
i
insisted
on
the
funeral
being
respectable
heathcliff
said
i
might
have
my
own
way
there
too
only
he
desired
me
to
remember
that
the
money
for
the
whole
affair
came
out
of
his
pocket
he
maintained
a
hard
careless
deportment
indicative
of
neither
joy
nor
sorrow
if
anything
it
expressed
a
flinty
gratification
at
a
piece
of
difficult
work
successfully
executed
i
observed
once
indeed
something
like
exultation
in
his
aspect
it
was
just
when
the
people
were
bearing
the
coffin
from
the
house
he
had
the
hypocrisy
to
represent
a
mourner
and
previous
to
following
with
hareton
he
lifted
the
unfortunate
child
on
to
the
table
and
muttered
with
peculiar
gusto
my
bonny
lad
you
are
and
we
see
if
one
tree
wo
grow
as
crooked
as
another
with
the
same
wind
to
twist
it
the
unsuspecting
thing
was
pleased
at
this
speech
he
played
with
heathcliff
whiskers
and
stroked
his
cheek
but
i
divined
its
meaning
and
observed
tartly
boy
must
go
back
with
me
to
thrushcross
grange
sir
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
less
yours
than
he
is
linton
say
so
he
demanded
course
he
has
ordered
me
to
take
him
i
replied
said
the
scoundrel
not
argue
the
subject
now
but
i
have
a
fancy
to
try
my
hand
at
rearing
a
young
one
so
intimate
to
your
master
that
i
must
supply
the
place
of
this
with
my
own
if
he
attempt
to
remove
it
i
do
engage
to
let
hareton
go
undisputed
but
i
be
pretty
sure
to
make
the
other
come
remember
to
tell
him
this
hint
was
enough
to
bind
our
hands
i
repeated
its
substance
on
my
return
and
edgar
linton
little
interested
at
the
commencement
spoke
no
more
of
interfering
i
not
aware
that
he
could
have
done
it
to
any
purpose
had
he
been
ever
so
willing
the
guest
was
now
the
master
of
wuthering
heights
he
held
firm
possession
and
proved
to
the
attorney
who
in
his
turn
proved
it
to
linton
that
earnshaw
had
mortgaged
every
yard
of
land
he
owned
for
cash
to
supply
his
mania
for
gaming
and
he
heathcliff
was
the
mortgagee
in
that
manner
hareton
who
should
now
be
the
first
gentleman
in
the
neighbourhood
was
reduced
to
a
state
of
complete
dependence
on
his
father
inveterate
enemy
and
lives
in
his
own
house
as
a
servant
deprived
of
the
advantage
of
wages
quite
unable
to
right
himself
because
of
his
friendlessness
and
his
ignorance
that
he
has
been
wronged
chapter
xviii
the
twelve
years
continued
dean
following
that
dismal
period
were
the
happiest
of
my
life
my
greatest
troubles
in
their
passage
rose
from
our
little
lady
trifling
illnesses
which
she
had
to
experience
in
common
with
all
children
rich
and
poor
for
the
rest
after
the
first
six
months
she
grew
like
a
larch
and
could
walk
and
talk
too
in
her
own
way
before
the
heath
blossomed
a
second
time
over
dust
she
was
the
most
winning
thing
that
ever
brought
sunshine
into
a
desolate
house
a
real
beauty
in
face
with
the
earnshaws
handsome
dark
eyes
but
the
lintons
fair
skin
and
small
features
and
yellow
curling
hair
her
spirit
was
high
though
not
rough
and
qualified
by
a
heart
sensitive
and
lively
to
excess
in
its
affections
that
capacity
for
intense
attachments
reminded
me
of
her
mother
still
she
did
not
resemble
her
for
she
could
be
soft
and
mild
as
a
dove
and
she
had
a
gentle
voice
and
pensive
expression
her
anger
was
never
furious
her
love
never
fierce
it
was
deep
and
tender
however
it
must
be
acknowledged
she
had
faults
to
foil
her
gifts
a
propensity
to
be
saucy
was
one
and
a
perverse
will
that
indulged
children
invariably
acquire
whether
they
be
good
tempered
or
cross
if
a
servant
chanced
to
vex
her
it
was
always
shall
tell
papa
and
if
he
reproved
her
even
by
a
look
you
would
have
thought
it
a
business
i
do
believe
he
ever
did
speak
a
harsh
word
to
her
he
took
her
education
entirely
on
himself
and
made
it
an
amusement
fortunately
curiosity
and
a
quick
intellect
made
her
an
apt
scholar
she
learned
rapidly
and
eagerly
and
did
honour
to
his
teaching
till
she
reached
the
age
of
thirteen
she
had
not
once
been
beyond
the
range
of
the
park
by
herself
linton
would
take
her
with
him
a
mile
or
so
outside
on
rare
occasions
but
he
trusted
her
to
no
one
else
gimmerton
was
an
unsubstantial
name
in
her
ears
the
chapel
the
only
building
she
had
approached
or
entered
except
her
own
home
wuthering
heights
and
heathcliff
did
not
exist
for
her
she
was
a
perfect
recluse
and
apparently
perfectly
contented
sometimes
indeed
while
surveying
the
country
from
her
nursery
window
she
would
observe
how
long
will
it
be
before
i
can
walk
to
the
top
of
those
hills
i
wonder
what
lies
on
the
other
side
is
it
the
sea
miss
cathy
i
would
answer
is
hills
again
just
like
these
what
are
those
golden
rocks
like
when
you
stand
under
them
she
once
asked
the
abrupt
descent
of
penistone
crags
particularly
attracted
her
notice
especially
when
the
setting
sun
shone
on
it
and
the
topmost
heights
and
the
whole
extent
of
landscape
besides
lay
in
shadow
i
explained
that
they
were
bare
masses
of
stone
with
hardly
enough
earth
in
their
clefts
to
nourish
a
stunted
tree
why
are
they
bright
so
long
after
it
is
evening
here
she
pursued
they
are
a
great
deal
higher
up
than
we
are
replied
i
could
not
climb
them
they
are
too
high
and
steep
in
winter
the
frost
is
always
there
before
it
comes
to
us
and
deep
into
summer
i
have
found
snow
under
that
black
hollow
on
the
side
you
have
been
on
them
she
cried
gleefully
i
can
go
too
when
i
am
a
woman
has
papa
been
ellen
would
tell
you
miss
i
answered
hastily
they
are
not
worth
the
trouble
of
visiting
the
moors
where
you
ramble
with
him
are
much
nicer
and
thrushcross
park
is
the
finest
place
in
the
world
i
know
the
park
and
i
do
know
those
she
murmured
to
herself
i
should
delight
to
look
round
me
from
the
brow
of
that
tallest
point
my
little
pony
minny
shall
take
me
some
time
one
of
the
maids
mentioning
the
fairy
cave
quite
turned
her
head
with
a
desire
to
fulfil
this
project
she
teased
linton
about
it
and
he
promised
she
should
have
the
journey
when
she
got
older
but
miss
catherine
measured
her
age
by
months
and
am
i
old
enough
to
go
to
penistone
crags
was
the
constant
question
in
her
mouth
the
road
thither
wound
close
by
wuthering
heights
edgar
had
not
the
heart
to
pass
it
so
she
received
as
constantly
the
answer
yet
love
not
yet
i
said
heathcliff
lived
above
a
dozen
years
after
quitting
her
husband
her
family
were
of
a
delicate
constitution
she
and
edgar
both
lacked
the
ruddy
health
that
you
will
generally
meet
in
these
parts
what
her
last
illness
was
i
am
not
certain
i
conjecture
they
died
of
the
same
thing
a
kind
of
fever
slow
at
its
commencement
but
incurable
and
rapidly
consuming
life
towards
the
close
she
wrote
to
inform
her
brother
of
the
probable
conclusion
of
a
indisposition
under
which
she
had
suffered
and
entreated
him
to
come
to
her
if
possible
for
she
had
much
to
settle
and
she
wished
to
bid
him
adieu
and
deliver
linton
safely
into
his
hands
her
hope
was
that
linton
might
be
left
with
him
as
he
had
been
with
her
his
father
she
would
fain
convince
herself
had
no
desire
to
assume
the
burden
of
his
maintenance
or
education
my
master
hesitated
not
a
moment
in
complying
with
her
request
reluctant
as
he
was
to
leave
home
at
ordinary
calls
he
flew
to
answer
this
commanding
catherine
to
my
peculiar
vigilance
in
his
absence
with
reiterated
orders
that
she
must
not
wander
out
of
the
park
even
under
my
escort
he
did
not
calculate
on
her
going
unaccompanied
he
was
away
three
weeks
the
first
day
or
two
my
charge
sat
in
a
corner
of
the
library
too
sad
for
either
reading
or
playing
in
that
quiet
state
she
caused
me
little
trouble
but
it
was
succeeded
by
an
interval
of
impatient
fretful
weariness
and
being
too
busy
and
too
old
then
to
run
up
and
down
amusing
her
i
hit
on
a
method
by
which
she
might
entertain
herself
i
used
to
send
her
on
her
travels
round
the
grounds
now
on
foot
and
now
on
a
pony
indulging
her
with
a
patient
audience
of
all
her
real
and
imaginary
adventures
when
she
returned
the
summer
shone
in
full
prime
and
she
took
such
a
taste
for
this
solitary
rambling
that
she
often
contrived
to
remain
out
from
breakfast
till
tea
and
then
the
evenings
were
spent
in
recounting
her
fanciful
tales
i
did
not
fear
her
breaking
bounds
because
the
gates
were
generally
locked
and
i
thought
she
would
scarcely
venture
forth
alone
if
they
had
stood
wide
open
unluckily
my
confidence
proved
misplaced
catherine
came
to
me
one
morning
at
eight
and
said
she
was
that
day
an
arabian
merchant
going
to
cross
the
desert
with
his
caravan
and
i
must
give
her
plenty
of
provision
for
herself
and
beasts
a
horse
and
three
camels
personated
by
a
large
hound
and
a
couple
of
pointers
i
got
together
good
store
of
dainties
and
slung
them
in
a
basket
on
one
side
of
the
saddle
and
she
sprang
up
as
gay
as
a
fairy
sheltered
by
her
hat
and
gauze
veil
from
the
july
sun
and
trotted
off
with
a
merry
laugh
mocking
my
cautious
counsel
to
avoid
galloping
and
come
back
early
the
naughty
thing
never
made
her
appearance
at
tea
one
traveller
the
hound
being
an
old
dog
and
fond
of
its
ease
returned
but
neither
cathy
nor
the
pony
nor
the
two
pointers
were
visible
in
any
direction
i
despatched
emissaries
down
this
path
and
that
path
and
at
last
went
wandering
in
search
of
her
myself
there
was
a
labourer
working
at
a
fence
round
a
plantation
on
the
borders
of
the
grounds
i
inquired
of
him
if
he
had
seen
our
young
lady
saw
her
at
morn
he
replied
would
have
me
to
cut
her
a
hazel
switch
and
then
she
leapt
her
galloway
over
the
hedge
yonder
where
it
is
lowest
and
galloped
out
of
sight
you
may
guess
how
i
felt
at
hearing
this
news
it
struck
me
directly
she
must
have
started
for
penistone
crags
will
become
of
her
i
ejaculated
pushing
through
a
gap
which
the
man
was
repairing
and
making
straight
to
the
i
walked
as
if
for
a
wager
mile
after
mile
till
a
turn
brought
me
in
view
of
the
heights
but
no
catherine
could
i
detect
far
or
near
the
crags
lie
about
a
mile
and
a
half
beyond
heathcliff
place
and
that
is
four
from
the
grange
so
i
began
to
fear
night
would
fall
ere
i
could
reach
them
what
if
she
should
have
slipped
in
clambering
among
them
i
reflected
been
killed
or
broken
some
of
her
bones
my
suspense
was
truly
painful
and
at
first
it
gave
me
delightful
relief
to
observe
in
hurrying
by
the
farmhouse
charlie
the
fiercest
of
the
pointers
lying
under
a
window
with
swelled
head
and
bleeding
ear
i
opened
the
wicket
and
ran
to
the
door
knocking
vehemently
for
admittance
a
woman
whom
i
knew
and
who
formerly
lived
at
gimmerton
answered
she
had
been
servant
there
since
the
death
of
earnshaw
said
she
are
come
your
little
mistress
do
be
frightened
she
here
safe
but
i
glad
it
is
the
master
is
not
at
home
then
is
he
i
panted
quite
breathless
with
quick
walking
and
alarm
no
she
replied
he
and
joseph
are
off
and
i
think
they
wo
return
this
hour
or
more
step
in
and
rest
you
a
bit
i
entered
and
beheld
my
stray
lamb
seated
on
the
hearth
rocking
herself
in
a
little
chair
that
had
been
her
mother
when
a
child
her
hat
was
hung
against
the
wall
and
she
seemed
perfectly
at
home
laughing
and
chattering
in
the
best
spirits
imaginable
to
hareton
now
a
great
strong
lad
of
eighteen
who
stared
at
her
with
considerable
curiosity
and
astonishment
comprehending
precious
little
of
the
fluent
succession
of
remarks
and
questions
which
her
tongue
never
ceased
pouring
forth
well
miss
i
exclaimed
concealing
my
joy
under
an
angry
countenance
is
your
last
ride
till
papa
comes
back
i
not
trust
you
over
the
threshold
again
you
naughty
naughty
girl
ellen
she
cried
gaily
jumping
up
and
running
to
my
side
shall
have
a
pretty
story
to
tell
and
so
you
found
me
out
have
you
ever
been
here
in
your
life
before
that
hat
on
and
home
at
once
said
i
dreadfully
grieved
at
you
miss
cathy
you
done
extremely
wrong
it
no
use
pouting
and
crying
that
wo
repay
the
trouble
i
had
scouring
the
country
after
you
to
think
how
linton
charged
me
to
keep
you
in
and
you
stealing
off
so
it
shows
you
are
a
cunning
little
fox
and
nobody
will
put
faith
in
you
any
more
have
i
done
sobbed
she
instantly
checked
charged
me
nothing
he
not
scold
me
ellen
he
never
cross
like
you
come
i
repeated
tie
the
riband
now
let
us
have
no
petulance
oh
for
shame
you
thirteen
years
old
and
such
a
baby
this
exclamation
was
caused
by
her
pushing
the
hat
from
her
head
and
retreating
to
the
chimney
out
of
my
reach
said
the
servant
be
hard
on
the
bonny
lass
dean
we
made
her
stop
she
fain
have
ridden
forwards
afeard
you
should
be
uneasy
hareton
offered
to
go
with
her
and
i
thought
he
should
it
a
wild
road
over
the
hills
hareton
during
the
discussion
stood
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
too
awkward
to
speak
though
he
looked
as
if
he
did
not
relish
my
intrusion
long
am
i
to
wait
i
continued
disregarding
the
interference
will
be
dark
in
ten
minutes
where
is
the
pony
miss
cathy
and
where
is
phoenix
i
shall
leave
you
unless
you
be
quick
so
please
yourself
pony
is
in
the
yard
she
replied
phoenix
is
shut
in
there
he
bitten
and
so
is
charlie
i
was
going
to
tell
you
all
about
it
but
you
are
in
a
bad
temper
and
do
deserve
to
hear
i
picked
up
her
hat
and
approached
to
reinstate
it
but
perceiving
that
the
people
of
the
house
took
her
part
she
commenced
capering
round
the
room
and
on
my
giving
chase
ran
like
a
mouse
over
and
under
and
behind
the
furniture
rendering
it
ridiculous
for
me
to
pursue
hareton
and
the
woman
laughed
and
she
joined
them
and
waxed
more
impertinent
still
till
i
cried
in
great
irritation
miss
cathy
if
you
were
aware
whose
house
this
is
you
be
glad
enough
to
get
out
father
is
it
said
she
turning
to
hareton
he
replied
looking
down
and
blushing
bashfully
he
could
not
stand
a
steady
gaze
from
her
eyes
though
they
were
just
his
own
then
your
master
she
asked
he
coloured
deeper
with
a
different
feeling
muttered
an
oath
and
turned
away
is
his
master
continued
the
tiresome
girl
appealing
to
me
talked
about
our
house
and
our
folk
i
thought
he
had
been
the
owner
son
and
he
never
said
miss
he
should
have
done
should
he
if
he
a
servant
hareton
grew
black
as
a
at
this
childish
speech
i
silently
shook
my
questioner
and
at
last
succeeded
in
equipping
her
for
departure
get
my
horse
she
said
addressing
her
unknown
kinsman
as
she
would
one
of
the
at
the
grange
you
may
come
with
me
i
want
to
see
where
the
rises
in
the
marsh
and
to
hear
about
the
as
you
call
them
but
make
haste
what
the
matter
get
my
horse
i
say
see
thee
damned
before
i
be
servant
growled
the
lad
see
me
asked
catherine
in
surprise
thou
saucy
witch
he
replied
miss
cathy
you
see
you
have
got
into
pretty
company
i
interposed
words
to
be
used
to
a
young
lady
pray
do
begin
to
dispute
with
him
come
let
us
seek
for
minny
ourselves
and
begone
ellen
cried
she
staring
fixed
in
astonishment
dare
he
speak
so
to
me
must
he
be
made
to
do
as
i
ask
him
you
wicked
creature
i
shall
tell
papa
what
you
now
then
hareton
did
not
appear
to
feel
this
threat
so
the
tears
sprang
into
her
eyes
with
indignation
bring
the
pony
she
exclaimed
turning
to
the
woman
let
my
dog
free
this
moment
miss
answered
she
addressed
lose
nothing
by
being
civil
though
hareton
there
be
not
the
master
son
he
your
cousin
and
i
was
never
hired
to
serve
you
my
cousin
cried
cathy
with
a
scornful
laugh
indeed
responded
her
reprover
ellen
do
let
them
say
such
things
she
pursued
in
great
trouble
is
gone
to
fetch
my
cousin
from
london
my
cousin
is
a
gentleman
son
that
my
she
stopped
and
wept
outright
upset
at
the
bare
notion
of
relationship
with
such
a
clown
hush
i
whispered
can
have
many
cousins
and
of
all
sorts
miss
cathy
without
being
any
the
worse
for
it
only
they
keep
their
company
if
they
be
disagreeable
and
bad
not
he
not
my
cousin
ellen
she
went
on
gathering
fresh
grief
from
reflection
and
flinging
herself
into
my
arms
for
refuge
from
the
idea
i
was
much
vexed
at
her
and
the
servant
for
their
mutual
revelations
having
no
doubt
of
linton
approaching
arrival
communicated
by
the
former
being
reported
to
heathcliff
and
feeling
as
confident
that
catherine
first
thought
on
her
father
return
would
be
to
seek
an
explanation
of
the
latter
assertion
concerning
her
kindred
hareton
recovering
from
his
disgust
at
being
taken
for
a
servant
seemed
moved
by
her
distress
and
having
fetched
the
pony
round
to
the
door
he
took
to
propitiate
her
a
fine
terrier
whelp
from
the
kennel
and
putting
it
into
her
hand
bid
her
whist
for
he
meant
nought
pausing
in
her
lamentations
she
surveyed
him
with
a
glance
of
awe
and
horror
then
burst
forth
anew
i
could
scarcely
refrain
from
smiling
at
this
antipathy
to
the
poor
fellow
who
was
a
athletic
youth
in
features
and
stout
and
healthy
but
attired
in
garments
befitting
his
daily
occupations
of
working
on
the
farm
and
lounging
among
the
moors
after
rabbits
and
game
still
i
thought
i
could
detect
in
his
physiognomy
a
mind
owning
better
qualities
than
his
father
ever
possessed
good
things
lost
amid
a
wilderness
of
weeds
to
be
sure
whose
rankness
far
their
neglected
growth
yet
notwithstanding
evidence
of
a
wealthy
soil
that
might
yield
luxuriant
crops
under
other
and
favourable
circumstances
heathcliff
i
believe
had
not
treated
him
physically
ill
thanks
to
his
fearless
nature
which
offered
no
temptation
to
that
course
of
oppression
he
had
none
of
the
timid
susceptibility
that
would
have
given
zest
to
in
heathcliff
judgment
he
appeared
to
have
bent
his
malevolence
on
making
him
a
brute
he
was
never
taught
to
read
or
write
never
rebuked
for
any
bad
habit
which
did
not
annoy
his
keeper
never
led
a
single
step
towards
virtue
or
guarded
by
a
single
precept
against
vice
and
from
what
i
heard
joseph
contributed
much
to
his
deterioration
by
a
partiality
which
prompted
him
to
flatter
and
pet
him
as
a
boy
because
he
was
the
head
of
the
old
family
and
as
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
accusing
catherine
earnshaw
and
heathcliff
when
children
of
putting
the
master
past
his
patience
and
compelling
him
to
seek
solace
in
drink
by
what
he
termed
their
ways
so
at
present
he
laid
the
whole
burden
of
hareton
faults
on
the
shoulders
of
the
usurper
of
his
property
if
the
lad
swore
he
correct
him
nor
however
culpably
he
behaved
it
gave
joseph
satisfaction
apparently
to
watch
him
go
the
worst
lengths
he
allowed
that
the
lad
was
ruined
that
his
soul
was
abandoned
to
perdition
but
then
he
reflected
that
heathcliff
must
answer
for
it
hareton
blood
would
be
required
at
his
hands
and
there
lay
immense
consolation
in
that
thought
joseph
had
instilled
into
him
a
pride
of
name
and
of
his
lineage
he
would
had
he
dared
have
fostered
hate
between
him
and
the
present
owner
of
the
heights
but
his
dread
of
that
owner
amounted
to
superstition
and
he
confined
his
feelings
regarding
him
to
muttered
innuendoes
and
private
comminations
i
do
pretend
to
be
intimately
acquainted
with
the
mode
of
living
customary
in
those
days
at
wuthering
heights
i
only
speak
from
hearsay
for
i
saw
little
the
villagers
affirmed
heathcliff
was
and
a
cruel
hard
landlord
to
his
tenants
but
the
house
inside
had
regained
its
ancient
aspect
of
comfort
under
female
management
and
the
scenes
of
riot
common
in
hindley
time
were
not
now
enacted
within
its
walls
the
master
was
too
gloomy
to
seek
companionship
with
any
people
good
or
bad
and
he
is
yet
this
however
is
not
making
progress
with
my
story
miss
cathy
rejected
the
of
the
terrier
and
demanded
her
own
dogs
charlie
and
phoenix
they
came
limping
and
hanging
their
heads
and
we
set
out
for
home
sadly
out
of
sorts
every
one
of
us
i
could
not
wring
from
my
little
lady
how
she
had
spent
the
day
except
that
as
i
supposed
the
goal
of
her
pilgrimage
was
penistone
crags
and
she
arrived
without
adventure
to
the
gate
of
the
when
hareton
happened
to
issue
forth
attended
by
some
canine
followers
who
attacked
her
train
they
had
a
smart
battle
before
their
owners
could
separate
them
that
formed
an
introduction
catherine
told
hareton
who
she
was
and
where
she
was
going
and
asked
him
to
show
her
the
way
finally
beguiling
him
to
accompany
her
he
opened
the
mysteries
of
the
fairy
cave
and
twenty
other
queer
places
but
being
in
disgrace
i
was
not
favoured
with
a
description
of
the
interesting
objects
she
saw
i
could
gather
however
that
her
guide
had
been
a
favourite
till
she
hurt
his
feelings
by
addressing
him
as
a
servant
and
heathcliff
housekeeper
hurt
hers
by
calling
him
her
cousin
then
the
language
he
had
held
to
her
rankled
in
her
heart
she
who
was
always
and
and
and
with
everybody
at
the
grange
to
be
insulted
so
shockingly
by
a
stranger
she
did
not
comprehend
it
and
hard
work
i
had
to
obtain
a
promise
that
she
would
not
lay
the
grievance
before
her
father
i
explained
how
he
objected
to
the
whole
household
at
the
heights
and
how
sorry
he
would
be
to
find
she
had
been
there
but
i
insisted
most
on
the
fact
that
if
she
revealed
my
negligence
of
his
orders
he
would
perhaps
be
so
angry
that
i
should
have
to
leave
and
cathy
could
bear
that
prospect
she
pledged
her
word
and
kept
it
for
my
sake
after
all
she
was
a
sweet
little
girl
chapter
xix
a
letter
edged
with
black
announced
the
day
of
my
master
return
isabella
was
dead
and
he
wrote
to
bid
me
get
mourning
for
his
daughter
and
arrange
a
room
and
other
accommodations
for
his
youthful
nephew
catherine
ran
wild
with
joy
at
the
idea
of
welcoming
her
father
back
and
indulged
most
sanguine
anticipations
of
the
innumerable
excellencies
of
her
cousin
the
evening
of
their
expected
arrival
came
since
early
morning
she
had
been
busy
ordering
her
own
small
affairs
and
now
attired
in
her
new
black
frock
poor
thing
her
aunt
death
impressed
her
with
no
definite
sorrow
she
obliged
me
by
constant
worrying
to
walk
with
her
down
through
the
grounds
to
meet
them
is
just
six
months
younger
than
i
am
she
chattered
as
we
strolled
leisurely
over
the
swells
and
hollows
of
mossy
turf
under
shadow
of
the
trees
delightful
it
will
be
to
have
him
for
a
playfellow
aunt
isabella
sent
papa
a
beautiful
lock
of
his
hair
it
was
lighter
than
mine
more
flaxen
and
quite
as
fine
i
have
it
carefully
preserved
in
a
little
glass
box
and
i
often
thought
what
a
pleasure
it
would
be
to
see
its
owner
oh
i
am
happy
and
papa
dear
dear
papa
come
ellen
let
us
run
come
run
she
ran
and
returned
and
ran
again
many
times
before
my
sober
footsteps
reached
the
gate
and
then
she
seated
herself
on
the
grassy
bank
beside
the
path
and
tried
to
wait
patiently
but
that
was
impossible
she
could
be
still
a
minute
long
they
are
she
exclaimed
i
see
some
dust
on
the
road
they
are
coming
no
when
will
they
be
here
may
we
not
go
a
little
way
half
a
mile
ellen
only
just
half
a
mile
do
say
yes
to
that
clump
of
birches
at
the
turn
i
refused
staunchly
at
length
her
suspense
was
ended
the
travelling
carriage
rolled
in
sight
miss
cathy
shrieked
and
stretched
out
her
arms
as
soon
as
she
caught
her
father
face
looking
from
the
window
he
descended
nearly
as
eager
as
herself
and
a
considerable
interval
elapsed
ere
they
had
a
thought
to
spare
for
any
but
themselves
while
they
exchanged
caresses
i
took
a
peep
in
to
see
after
linton
he
was
asleep
in
a
corner
wrapped
in
a
warm
cloak
as
if
it
had
been
winter
a
pale
delicate
effeminate
boy
who
might
have
been
taken
for
my
master
younger
brother
so
strong
was
the
resemblance
but
there
was
a
sickly
peevishness
in
his
aspect
that
edgar
linton
never
had
the
latter
saw
me
looking
and
having
shaken
hands
advised
me
to
close
the
door
and
leave
him
undisturbed
for
the
journey
had
fatigued
him
cathy
would
fain
have
taken
one
glance
but
her
father
told
her
to
come
and
they
walked
together
up
the
park
while
i
hastened
before
to
prepare
the
servants
darling
said
linton
addressing
his
daughter
as
they
halted
at
the
bottom
of
the
front
steps
cousin
is
not
so
strong
or
so
merry
as
you
are
and
he
has
lost
his
mother
remember
a
very
short
time
since
therefore
do
expect
him
to
play
and
run
about
with
you
directly
and
do
harass
him
much
by
talking
let
him
be
quiet
this
evening
at
least
will
you
yes
papa
answered
catherine
i
do
want
to
see
him
and
he
has
once
looked
out
the
carriage
stopped
and
the
sleeper
being
roused
was
lifted
to
the
ground
by
his
uncle
is
your
cousin
cathy
linton
he
said
putting
their
little
hands
together
fond
of
you
already
and
mind
you
do
grieve
her
by
crying
try
to
be
cheerful
now
the
travelling
is
at
an
end
and
you
have
nothing
to
do
but
rest
and
amuse
yourself
as
you
please
me
go
to
bed
then
answered
the
boy
shrinking
from
salute
and
he
put
his
fingers
to
remove
incipient
tears
come
there
a
good
child
i
whispered
leading
him
in
make
her
weep
too
see
how
sorry
she
is
for
you
i
do
not
know
whether
it
was
sorrow
for
him
but
his
cousin
put
on
as
sad
a
countenance
as
himself
and
returned
to
her
father
all
three
entered
and
mounted
to
the
library
where
tea
was
laid
ready
i
proceeded
to
remove
linton
cap
and
mantle
and
placed
him
on
a
chair
by
the
table
but
he
was
no
sooner
seated
than
he
began
to
cry
afresh
my
master
inquired
what
was
the
matter
ca
sit
on
a
chair
sobbed
the
boy
to
the
sofa
then
and
ellen
shall
bring
you
some
tea
answered
his
uncle
patiently
he
had
been
greatly
tried
during
the
journey
i
felt
convinced
by
his
fretful
ailing
charge
linton
slowly
trailed
himself
off
and
lay
down
cathy
carried
a
footstool
and
her
cup
to
his
side
at
first
she
sat
silent
but
that
could
not
last
she
had
resolved
to
make
a
pet
of
her
little
cousin
as
she
would
have
him
to
be
and
she
commenced
stroking
his
curls
and
kissing
his
cheek
and
offering
him
tea
in
her
saucer
like
a
baby
this
pleased
him
for
he
was
not
much
better
he
dried
his
eyes
and
lightened
into
a
faint
smile
he
do
very
well
said
the
master
to
me
after
watching
them
a
minute
well
if
we
can
keep
him
ellen
the
company
of
a
child
of
his
own
age
will
instil
new
spirit
into
him
soon
and
by
wishing
for
strength
he
gain
it
if
we
can
keep
him
i
mused
to
myself
and
sore
misgivings
came
over
me
that
there
was
slight
hope
of
that
and
then
i
thought
how
ever
will
that
weakling
live
at
wuthering
heights
between
his
father
and
hareton
what
playmates
and
instructors
they
be
our
doubts
were
presently
decided
even
earlier
than
i
expected
i
had
just
taken
the
children
after
tea
was
finished
and
seen
linton
asleep
he
would
not
suffer
me
to
leave
him
till
that
was
the
case
i
had
come
down
and
was
standing
by
the
table
in
the
hall
lighting
a
bedroom
candle
for
edgar
when
a
maid
stepped
out
of
the
kitchen
and
informed
me
that
heathcliff
servant
joseph
was
at
the
door
and
wished
to
speak
with
the
master
shall
ask
him
what
he
wants
first
i
said
in
considerable
trepidation
very
unlikely
hour
to
be
troubling
people
and
the
instant
they
have
returned
from
a
long
journey
i
do
think
the
master
can
see
him
joseph
had
advanced
through
the
kitchen
as
i
uttered
these
words
and
now
presented
himself
in
the
hall
he
was
donned
in
his
sunday
garments
with
his
most
sanctimonious
and
sourest
face
and
holding
his
hat
in
one
hand
and
his
stick
in
the
other
he
proceeded
to
clean
his
shoes
on
the
mat
joseph
i
said
coldly
business
brings
you
here
maister
linton
i
mun
spake
to
he
answered
waving
me
disdainfully
aside
linton
is
going
to
bed
unless
you
have
something
particular
to
say
i
sure
he
wo
hear
it
now
i
continued
had
better
sit
down
in
there
and
entrust
your
message
to
me
is
his
rahm
pursued
the
fellow
surveying
the
range
of
closed
doors
i
perceived
he
was
bent
on
refusing
my
mediation
so
very
reluctantly
i
went
up
to
the
library
and
announced
the
unseasonable
visitor
advising
that
he
should
be
dismissed
till
next
day
linton
had
no
time
to
empower
me
to
do
so
for
joseph
mounted
close
at
my
heels
and
pushing
into
the
apartment
planted
himself
at
the
far
side
of
the
table
with
his
two
fists
clapped
on
the
head
of
his
stick
and
began
in
an
elevated
tone
as
if
anticipating
opposition
has
sent
me
for
his
lad
and
i
mun
goa
back
him
edgar
linton
was
silent
a
minute
an
expression
of
exceeding
sorrow
overcast
his
features
he
would
have
pitied
the
child
on
his
own
account
but
recalling
isabella
hopes
and
fears
and
anxious
wishes
for
her
son
and
her
commendations
of
him
to
his
care
he
grieved
bitterly
at
the
prospect
of
yielding
him
up
and
searched
in
his
heart
how
it
might
be
avoided
no
plan
offered
itself
the
very
exhibition
of
any
desire
to
keep
him
would
have
rendered
the
claimant
more
peremptory
there
was
nothing
left
but
to
resign
him
however
he
was
not
going
to
rouse
him
from
his
sleep
heathcliff
he
answered
calmly
his
son
shall
come
to
wuthering
heights
he
is
in
bed
and
too
tired
to
go
the
distance
now
you
may
also
tell
him
that
the
mother
of
linton
desired
him
to
remain
under
my
guardianship
and
at
present
his
health
is
very
precarious
said
joseph
giving
a
thud
with
his
prop
on
the
floor
and
assuming
an
authoritative
air
that
means
naught
hathecliff
maks
noa
o
t
mother
nor
ye
norther
but
he
heu
his
lad
und
i
mun
tak
him
soa
now
ye
knaw
shall
not
answered
linton
decisively
down
stairs
at
once
and
repeat
to
your
master
what
i
have
said
ellen
show
him
down
go
and
aiding
the
indignant
elder
with
a
lift
by
the
arm
he
rid
the
room
of
him
and
closed
the
door
weell
shouted
joseph
as
he
slowly
drew
off
come
hisseln
and
thrust
out
if
ye
darr
chapter
xx
to
obviate
the
danger
of
this
threat
being
fulfilled
linton
commissioned
me
to
take
the
boy
home
early
on
catherine
pony
and
said
he
we
shall
now
have
no
influence
over
his
destiny
good
or
bad
you
must
say
nothing
of
where
he
is
gone
to
my
daughter
she
can
not
associate
with
him
hereafter
and
it
is
better
for
her
to
remain
in
ignorance
of
his
proximity
lest
she
should
be
restless
and
anxious
to
visit
the
heights
merely
tell
her
his
father
sent
for
him
suddenly
and
he
has
been
obliged
to
leave
us
linton
was
very
reluctant
to
be
roused
from
his
bed
at
five
and
astonished
to
be
informed
that
he
must
prepare
for
further
travelling
but
i
softened
off
the
matter
by
stating
that
he
was
going
to
spend
some
time
with
his
father
heathcliff
who
wished
to
see
him
so
much
he
did
not
like
to
defer
the
pleasure
till
he
should
recover
from
his
late
journey
father
he
cried
in
strange
perplexity
never
told
me
i
had
a
father
where
does
he
live
i
rather
stay
with
uncle
lives
a
little
distance
from
the
grange
i
replied
beyond
those
hills
not
so
far
but
you
may
walk
over
here
when
you
get
hearty
and
you
should
be
glad
to
go
home
and
to
see
him
you
must
try
to
love
him
as
you
did
your
mother
and
then
he
will
love
you
why
have
i
not
heard
of
him
before
asked
linton
mamma
and
he
live
together
as
other
people
do
had
business
to
keep
him
in
the
north
i
answered
your
mother
health
required
her
to
reside
in
the
south
why
did
mamma
speak
to
me
about
him
persevered
the
child
often
talked
of
uncle
and
i
learnt
to
love
him
long
ago
how
am
i
to
love
papa
i
do
know
him
all
children
love
their
parents
i
said
mother
perhaps
thought
you
would
want
to
be
with
him
if
she
mentioned
him
often
to
you
let
us
make
haste
an
early
ride
on
such
a
beautiful
morning
is
much
preferable
to
an
hour
more
sleep
to
go
with
us
he
demanded
little
girl
i
saw
yesterday
now
replied
i
uncle
he
continued
i
shall
be
your
companion
there
i
said
linton
sank
back
on
his
pillow
and
fell
into
a
brown
study
wo
go
without
uncle
he
cried
at
length
ca
tell
where
you
mean
to
take
me
i
attempted
to
persuade
him
of
the
naughtiness
of
showing
reluctance
to
meet
his
father
still
he
obstinately
resisted
any
progress
towards
dressing
and
i
had
to
call
for
my
master
assistance
in
coaxing
him
out
of
bed
the
poor
thing
was
finally
got
off
with
several
delusive
assurances
that
his
absence
should
be
short
that
edgar
and
cathy
would
visit
him
and
other
promises
equally
which
i
invented
and
reiterated
at
intervals
throughout
the
way
the
pure
air
the
bright
sunshine
and
the
gentle
canter
of
minny
relieved
his
despondency
after
a
while
he
began
to
put
questions
concerning
his
new
home
and
its
inhabitants
with
greater
interest
and
liveliness
wuthering
heights
as
pleasant
a
place
as
thrushcross
grange
he
inquired
turning
to
take
a
last
glance
into
the
valley
whence
a
light
mist
mounted
and
formed
a
fleecy
cloud
on
the
skirts
of
the
blue
is
not
so
buried
in
trees
i
replied
it
is
not
quite
so
large
but
you
can
see
the
country
beautifully
all
round
and
the
air
is
healthier
for
you
fresher
and
drier
you
will
perhaps
think
the
building
old
and
dark
at
first
though
it
is
a
respectable
house
the
next
best
in
the
neighbourhood
and
you
will
have
such
nice
rambles
on
the
moors
hareton
earnshaw
that
is
miss
cathy
other
cousin
and
so
yours
in
a
manner
will
show
you
all
the
sweetest
spots
and
you
can
bring
a
book
in
fine
weather
and
make
a
green
hollow
your
study
and
now
and
then
your
uncle
may
join
you
in
a
walk
he
does
frequently
walk
out
on
the
hills
what
is
my
father
like
he
asked
he
as
young
and
handsome
as
uncle
as
young
said
i
he
has
black
hair
and
eyes
and
looks
sterner
and
he
is
taller
and
bigger
altogether
he
not
seem
to
you
so
gentle
and
kind
at
first
perhaps
because
it
is
not
his
way
still
mind
you
be
frank
and
cordial
with
him
and
naturally
he
be
fonder
of
you
than
any
uncle
for
you
are
his
own
hair
and
eyes
mused
linton
ca
fancy
him
then
i
am
not
like
him
am
i
much
i
answered
not
a
morsel
i
thought
surveying
with
regret
the
white
complexion
and
slim
frame
of
my
companion
and
his
large
languid
eyes
his
mother
eyes
save
that
unless
a
morbid
touchiness
kindled
them
a
moment
they
had
not
a
vestige
of
her
sparkling
spirit
strange
that
he
should
never
come
to
see
mamma
and
me
he
murmured
he
ever
seen
me
if
he
has
i
must
have
been
a
baby
i
remember
not
a
single
thing
about
him
master
linton
said
i
hundred
miles
is
a
great
distance
and
ten
years
seem
very
different
in
length
to
a
person
compared
with
what
they
do
to
you
it
is
probable
heathcliff
proposed
going
from
summer
to
summer
but
never
found
a
convenient
opportunity
and
now
it
is
too
late
do
trouble
him
with
questions
on
the
subject
it
will
disturb
him
for
no
good
the
boy
was
fully
occupied
with
his
own
cogitations
for
the
remainder
of
the
ride
till
we
halted
before
the
farmhouse
i
watched
to
catch
his
impressions
in
his
countenance
he
surveyed
the
carved
front
and
lattices
the
straggling
and
crooked
firs
with
solemn
intentness
and
then
shook
his
head
his
private
feelings
entirely
disapproved
of
the
exterior
of
his
new
abode
but
he
had
sense
to
postpone
complaining
there
might
be
compensation
within
before
he
dismounted
i
went
and
opened
the
door
it
was
six
the
family
had
just
finished
breakfast
the
servant
was
clearing
and
wiping
down
the
table
joseph
stood
by
his
master
chair
telling
some
tale
concerning
a
lame
horse
and
hareton
was
preparing
for
the
hayfield
nelly
said
heathcliff
when
he
saw
me
feared
i
should
have
to
come
down
and
fetch
my
property
myself
you
brought
it
have
you
let
us
see
what
we
can
make
of
it
he
got
up
and
strode
to
the
door
hareton
and
joseph
followed
in
gaping
curiosity
poor
linton
ran
a
frightened
eye
over
the
faces
of
the
three
said
joseph
after
a
grave
inspection
swopped
wi
ye
maister
an
yon
his
lass
heathcliff
having
stared
his
son
into
an
ague
of
confusion
uttered
a
scornful
laugh
what
a
beauty
what
a
lovely
charming
thing
he
exclaimed
they
reared
it
on
snails
and
sour
milk
nelly
oh
damn
my
soul
but
that
worse
than
i
expected
and
the
devil
knows
i
was
not
sanguine
i
bid
the
trembling
and
bewildered
child
get
down
and
enter
he
did
not
thoroughly
comprehend
the
meaning
of
his
father
speech
or
whether
it
were
intended
for
him
indeed
he
was
not
yet
certain
that
the
grim
sneering
stranger
was
his
father
but
he
clung
to
me
with
growing
trepidation
and
on
heathcliff
taking
a
seat
and
bidding
him
hither
he
hid
his
face
on
my
shoulder
and
wept
tut
said
heathcliff
stretching
out
a
hand
and
dragging
him
roughly
between
his
knees
and
then
holding
up
his
head
by
the
chin
of
that
nonsense
we
not
going
to
hurt
thee
linton
is
that
thy
name
thou
art
thy
mother
child
entirely
where
is
my
share
in
thee
puling
chicken
he
took
off
the
boy
cap
and
pushed
back
his
thick
flaxen
curls
felt
his
slender
arms
and
his
small
fingers
during
which
examination
linton
ceased
crying
and
lifted
his
great
blue
eyes
to
inspect
the
inspector
you
know
me
asked
heathcliff
having
satisfied
himself
that
the
limbs
were
all
equally
frail
and
feeble
said
linton
with
a
gaze
of
vacant
fear
heard
of
me
i
daresay
he
replied
again
what
a
shame
of
your
mother
never
to
waken
your
filial
regard
for
me
you
are
my
son
then
i
tell
you
and
your
mother
was
a
wicked
slut
to
leave
you
in
ignorance
of
the
sort
of
father
you
possessed
now
do
wince
and
colour
up
though
it
is
something
to
see
you
have
not
white
blood
be
a
good
lad
and
i
do
for
you
nelly
if
you
be
tired
you
may
sit
down
if
not
get
home
again
i
guess
you
report
what
you
hear
and
see
to
the
cipher
at
the
grange
and
this
thing
wo
be
settled
while
you
linger
about
it
replied
i
hope
you
be
kind
to
the
boy
heathcliff
or
you
not
keep
him
long
and
he
all
you
have
akin
in
the
wide
world
that
you
will
ever
know
remember
be
very
kind
to
him
you
need
fear
he
said
laughing
nobody
else
must
be
kind
to
him
i
jealous
of
monopolising
his
affection
and
to
begin
my
kindness
joseph
bring
the
lad
some
breakfast
hareton
you
infernal
calf
begone
to
your
work
yes
nell
he
added
when
they
had
departed
son
is
prospective
owner
of
your
place
and
i
should
not
wish
him
to
die
till
i
was
certain
of
being
his
successor
besides
he
and
i
want
the
triumph
of
seeing
descendant
fairly
lord
of
their
estates
my
child
hiring
their
children
to
till
their
fathers
lands
for
wages
that
is
the
sole
consideration
which
can
make
me
endure
the
whelp
i
despise
him
for
himself
and
hate
him
for
the
memories
he
revives
but
that
consideration
is
sufficient
he
as
safe
with
me
and
shall
be
tended
as
carefully
as
your
master
tends
his
own
i
have
a
room
furnished
for
him
in
handsome
style
i
engaged
a
tutor
also
to
come
three
times
a
week
from
twenty
miles
distance
to
teach
him
what
he
pleases
to
learn
ordered
hareton
to
obey
him
and
in
fact
i
arranged
everything
with
a
view
to
preserve
the
superior
and
the
gentleman
in
him
above
his
associates
i
do
regret
however
that
he
so
little
deserves
the
trouble
if
i
wished
any
blessing
in
the
world
it
was
to
find
him
a
worthy
object
of
pride
and
i
bitterly
disappointed
with
the
whining
wretch
while
he
was
speaking
joseph
returned
bearing
a
basin
of
and
placed
it
before
linton
who
stirred
round
the
homely
mess
with
a
look
of
aversion
and
affirmed
he
could
not
eat
it
i
saw
the
old
shared
largely
in
his
master
scorn
of
the
child
though
he
was
compelled
to
retain
the
sentiment
in
his
heart
because
heathcliff
plainly
meant
his
underlings
to
hold
him
in
honour
can
not
ate
it
repeated
he
peering
in
linton
face
and
subduing
his
voice
to
a
whisper
for
fear
of
being
overheard
maister
hareton
nivir
ate
naught
else
when
he
wer
a
little
and
what
wer
gooid
enough
for
him
gooid
enough
for
ye
i
rayther
think
eat
it
answered
linton
snappishly
it
away
joseph
snatched
up
the
food
indignantly
and
brought
it
to
us
there
aught
ails
th
victuals
he
asked
thrusting
the
tray
under
heathcliff
nose
should
ail
them
he
said
answered
joseph
dainty
chap
says
he
cannut
ate
but
i
guess
it
raight
his
mother
wer
just
soa
we
wer
too
mucky
to
sow
t
corn
for
makking
her
breead
mention
his
mother
to
me
said
the
master
angrily
him
something
that
he
can
eat
that
all
what
is
his
usual
food
nelly
i
suggested
boiled
milk
or
tea
and
the
housekeeper
received
instructions
to
prepare
some
come
i
reflected
his
father
selfishness
may
contribute
to
his
comfort
he
perceives
his
delicate
constitution
and
the
necessity
of
treating
him
tolerably
i
console
edgar
by
acquainting
him
with
the
turn
heathcliff
humour
has
taken
having
no
excuse
for
lingering
longer
i
slipped
out
while
linton
was
engaged
in
timidly
rebuffing
the
advances
of
a
friendly
but
he
was
too
much
on
the
alert
to
be
cheated
as
i
closed
the
door
i
heard
a
cry
and
a
frantic
repetition
of
the
words
leave
me
i
not
stay
here
i
not
stay
here
then
the
latch
was
raised
and
fell
they
did
not
suffer
him
to
come
forth
i
mounted
minny
and
urged
her
to
a
trot
and
so
my
brief
guardianship
ended
chapter
xxi
we
had
sad
work
with
little
cathy
that
day
she
rose
in
high
glee
eager
to
join
her
cousin
and
such
passionate
tears
and
lamentations
followed
the
news
of
his
departure
that
edgar
himself
was
obliged
to
soothe
her
by
affirming
he
should
come
back
soon
he
added
however
i
can
get
him
and
there
were
no
hopes
of
that
this
promise
poorly
pacified
her
but
time
was
more
potent
and
though
still
at
intervals
she
inquired
of
her
father
when
linton
would
return
before
she
did
see
him
again
his
features
had
waxed
so
dim
in
her
memory
that
she
did
not
recognise
him
when
i
chanced
to
encounter
the
housekeeper
of
wuthering
heights
in
paying
business
visits
to
gimmerton
i
used
to
ask
how
the
young
master
got
on
for
he
lived
almost
as
secluded
as
catherine
herself
and
was
never
to
be
seen
i
could
gather
from
her
that
he
continued
in
weak
health
and
was
a
tiresome
inmate
she
said
heathcliff
seemed
to
dislike
him
ever
longer
and
worse
though
he
took
some
trouble
to
conceal
it
he
had
an
antipathy
to
the
sound
of
his
voice
and
could
not
do
at
all
with
his
sitting
in
the
same
room
with
him
many
minutes
together
there
seldom
passed
much
talk
between
them
linton
learnt
his
lessons
and
spent
his
evenings
in
a
small
apartment
they
called
the
parlour
or
else
lay
in
bed
all
day
for
he
was
constantly
getting
coughs
and
colds
and
aches
and
pains
of
some
sort
i
never
know
such
a
fainthearted
creature
added
the
woman
one
so
careful
of
hisseln
he
go
on
if
i
leave
the
window
open
a
bit
late
in
the
evening
oh
it
killing
a
breath
of
night
air
and
he
must
have
a
fire
in
the
middle
of
summer
and
joseph
is
poison
and
he
must
always
have
sweets
and
dainties
and
always
milk
milk
for
ever
heeding
naught
how
the
rest
of
us
are
pinched
in
winter
and
there
he
sit
wrapped
in
his
furred
cloak
in
his
chair
by
the
fire
with
some
toast
and
water
or
other
slop
on
the
hob
to
sip
at
and
if
hareton
for
pity
comes
to
amuse
him
hareton
is
not
though
he
rough
they
sure
to
part
one
swearing
and
the
other
crying
i
believe
the
master
would
relish
earnshaw
thrashing
him
to
a
mummy
if
he
were
not
his
son
and
i
certain
he
would
be
fit
to
turn
him
out
of
doors
if
he
knew
half
the
nursing
he
gives
hisseln
but
then
he
wo
go
into
danger
of
temptation
he
never
enters
the
parlour
and
should
linton
show
those
ways
in
the
house
where
he
is
he
sends
him
directly
i
divined
from
this
account
that
utter
lack
of
sympathy
had
rendered
young
heathcliff
selfish
and
disagreeable
if
he
were
not
so
originally
and
my
interest
in
him
consequently
decayed
though
still
i
was
moved
with
a
sense
of
grief
at
his
lot
and
a
wish
that
he
had
been
left
with
us
edgar
encouraged
me
to
gain
information
he
thought
a
great
deal
about
him
i
fancy
and
would
have
run
some
risk
to
see
him
and
he
told
me
once
to
ask
the
housekeeper
whether
he
ever
came
into
the
village
she
said
he
had
only
been
twice
on
horseback
accompanying
his
father
and
both
times
he
pretended
to
be
quite
knocked
up
for
three
or
four
days
afterwards
that
housekeeper
left
if
i
recollect
rightly
two
years
after
he
came
and
another
whom
i
did
not
know
was
her
successor
she
lives
there
still
time
wore
on
at
the
grange
in
its
former
pleasant
way
till
miss
cathy
reached
sixteen
on
the
anniversary
of
her
birth
we
never
manifested
any
signs
of
rejoicing
because
it
was
also
the
anniversary
of
my
late
mistress
death
her
father
invariably
spent
that
day
alone
in
the
library
and
walked
at
dusk
as
far
as
gimmerton
kirkyard
where
he
would
frequently
prolong
his
stay
beyond
midnight
therefore
catherine
was
thrown
on
her
own
resources
for
amusement
this
twentieth
of
march
was
a
beautiful
spring
day
and
when
her
father
had
retired
my
young
lady
came
down
dressed
for
going
out
and
said
she
asked
to
have
a
ramble
on
the
edge
of
the
moor
with
me
linton
had
given
her
leave
if
we
went
only
a
short
distance
and
were
back
within
the
hour
make
haste
ellen
she
cried
know
where
i
wish
to
go
where
a
colony
of
are
settled
i
want
to
see
whether
they
have
made
their
nests
yet
must
be
a
good
distance
up
i
answered
do
breed
on
the
edge
of
the
moor
it
not
she
said
gone
very
near
with
papa
i
put
on
my
bonnet
and
sallied
out
thinking
nothing
more
of
the
matter
she
bounded
before
me
and
returned
to
my
side
and
was
off
again
like
a
young
greyhound
and
at
first
i
found
plenty
of
entertainment
in
listening
to
the
larks
singing
far
and
near
and
enjoying
the
sweet
warm
sunshine
and
watching
her
my
pet
and
my
delight
with
her
golden
ringlets
flying
loose
behind
and
her
bright
cheek
as
soft
and
pure
in
its
bloom
as
a
wild
rose
and
her
eyes
radiant
with
cloudless
pleasure
she
was
a
happy
creature
and
an
angel
in
those
days
it
a
pity
she
could
not
be
content
said
i
are
your
miss
cathy
we
should
be
at
them
the
grange
is
a
great
way
off
now
a
little
further
only
a
little
further
ellen
was
her
answer
continually
to
that
hillock
pass
that
bank
and
by
the
time
you
reach
the
other
side
i
shall
have
raised
the
birds
but
there
were
so
many
hillocks
and
banks
to
climb
and
pass
that
at
length
i
began
to
be
weary
and
told
her
we
must
halt
and
retrace
our
steps
i
shouted
to
her
as
she
had
outstripped
me
a
long
way
she
either
did
not
hear
or
did
not
regard
for
she
still
sprang
on
and
i
was
compelled
to
follow
finally
she
dived
into
a
hollow
and
before
i
came
in
sight
of
her
again
she
was
two
miles
nearer
wuthering
heights
than
her
own
home
and
i
beheld
a
couple
of
persons
arrest
her
one
of
whom
i
felt
convinced
was
heathcliff
himself
cathy
had
been
caught
in
the
fact
of
plundering
or
at
least
hunting
out
the
nests
of
the
grouse
the
heights
were
heathcliff
land
and
he
was
reproving
the
poacher
neither
taken
any
nor
found
any
she
said
as
i
toiled
to
them
expanding
her
hands
in
corroboration
of
the
statement
did
mean
to
take
them
but
papa
told
me
there
were
quantities
up
here
and
i
wished
to
see
the
eggs
heathcliff
glanced
at
me
with
an
smile
expressing
his
acquaintance
with
the
party
and
consequently
his
malevolence
towards
it
and
demanded
who
was
linton
of
thrushcross
grange
she
replied
thought
you
did
not
know
me
or
you
would
have
spoken
in
that
way
suppose
papa
is
highly
esteemed
and
respected
then
he
said
sarcastically
what
are
you
inquired
catherine
gazing
curiously
on
the
speaker
man
i
seen
before
is
he
your
son
she
pointed
to
hareton
the
other
individual
who
had
gained
nothing
but
increased
bulk
and
strength
by
the
addition
of
two
years
to
his
age
he
seemed
as
awkward
and
rough
as
ever
cathy
i
interrupted
will
be
three
hours
instead
of
one
that
we
are
out
presently
we
really
must
go
back
that
man
is
not
my
son
answered
heathcliff
pushing
me
aside
i
have
one
and
you
have
seen
him
before
too
and
though
your
nurse
is
in
a
hurry
i
think
both
you
and
she
would
be
the
better
for
a
little
rest
will
you
just
turn
this
nab
of
heath
and
walk
into
my
house
you
get
home
earlier
for
the
ease
and
you
shall
receive
a
kind
welcome
i
whispered
catherine
that
she
must
on
any
account
accede
to
the
proposal
it
was
entirely
out
of
the
question
she
asked
aloud
tired
of
running
and
the
ground
is
dewy
i
ca
sit
here
let
us
go
ellen
besides
he
says
i
have
seen
his
son
he
mistaken
i
think
but
i
guess
where
he
lives
at
the
farmhouse
i
visited
in
coming
from
penistone
crags
do
you
do
come
nelly
hold
your
tongue
it
will
be
a
treat
for
her
to
look
in
on
us
hareton
get
forwards
with
the
lass
you
shall
walk
with
me
nelly
she
not
going
to
any
such
place
i
cried
struggling
to
release
my
arm
which
he
had
seized
but
she
was
almost
at
the
already
scampering
round
the
brow
at
full
speed
her
appointed
companion
did
not
pretend
to
escort
her
he
shied
off
by
the
and
vanished
heathcliff
it
very
wrong
i
continued
know
you
mean
no
good
and
there
she
see
linton
and
all
will
be
told
as
soon
as
ever
we
return
and
i
shall
have
the
blame
want
her
to
see
linton
he
answered
looking
better
these
few
days
it
not
often
he
fit
to
be
seen
and
we
soon
persuade
her
to
keep
the
visit
secret
where
is
the
harm
of
it
harm
of
it
is
that
her
father
would
hate
me
if
he
found
i
suffered
her
to
enter
your
house
and
i
am
convinced
you
have
a
bad
design
in
encouraging
her
to
do
so
i
replied
design
is
as
honest
as
possible
i
inform
you
of
its
whole
scope
he
said
the
two
cousins
may
fall
in
love
and
get
married
i
acting
generously
to
your
master
his
young
chit
has
no
expectations
and
should
she
second
my
wishes
she
be
provided
for
at
once
as
joint
successor
with
linton
linton
died
i
answered
his
life
is
quite
uncertain
catherine
would
be
the
heir
she
would
not
he
said
is
no
clause
in
the
will
to
secure
it
so
his
property
would
go
to
me
but
to
prevent
disputes
i
desire
their
union
and
am
resolved
to
bring
it
about
i
resolved
she
shall
never
approach
your
house
with
me
again
i
returned
as
we
reached
the
gate
where
miss
cathy
waited
our
coming
heathcliff
bade
me
be
quiet
and
preceding
us
up
the
path
hastened
to
open
the
door
my
young
lady
gave
him
several
looks
as
if
she
could
not
exactly
make
up
her
mind
what
to
think
of
him
but
now
he
smiled
when
he
met
her
eye
and
softened
his
voice
in
addressing
her
and
i
was
foolish
enough
to
imagine
the
memory
of
her
mother
might
disarm
him
from
desiring
her
injury
linton
stood
on
the
hearth
he
had
been
out
walking
in
the
fields
for
his
cap
was
on
and
he
was
calling
to
joseph
to
bring
him
dry
shoes
he
had
grown
tall
of
his
age
still
wanting
some
months
of
sixteen
his
features
were
pretty
yet
and
his
eye
and
complexion
brighter
than
i
remembered
them
though
with
merely
temporary
lustre
borrowed
from
the
salubrious
air
and
genial
sun
who
is
that
asked
heathcliff
turning
to
cathy
you
tell
son
she
said
having
doubtfully
surveyed
first
one
and
then
the
other
yes
answered
he
is
this
the
only
time
you
have
beheld
him
think
ah
you
have
a
short
memory
linton
do
you
recall
your
cousin
that
you
used
to
tease
us
so
with
wishing
to
see
linton
cried
cathy
kindling
into
joyful
surprise
at
the
name
that
little
linton
he
taller
than
i
am
are
you
linton
the
youth
stepped
forward
and
acknowledged
himself
she
kissed
him
fervently
and
they
gazed
with
wonder
at
the
change
time
had
wrought
in
the
appearance
of
each
catherine
had
reached
her
full
height
her
figure
was
both
plump
and
slender
elastic
as
steel
and
her
whole
aspect
sparkling
with
health
and
spirits
linton
looks
and
movements
were
very
languid
and
his
form
extremely
slight
but
there
was
a
grace
in
his
manner
that
mitigated
these
defects
and
rendered
him
not
unpleasing
after
exchanging
numerous
marks
of
fondness
with
him
his
cousin
went
to
heathcliff
who
lingered
by
the
door
dividing
his
attention
between
the
objects
inside
and
those
that
lay
without
pretending
that
is
to
observe
the
latter
and
really
noting
the
former
alone
you
are
my
uncle
then
she
cried
reaching
up
to
salute
him
thought
i
liked
you
though
you
were
cross
at
first
why
do
you
visit
at
the
grange
with
linton
to
live
all
these
years
such
close
neighbours
and
never
see
us
is
odd
what
have
you
done
so
for
visited
it
once
or
twice
too
often
before
you
were
born
he
answered
damn
it
if
you
have
any
kisses
to
spare
give
them
to
linton
they
are
thrown
away
on
me
ellen
exclaimed
catherine
flying
to
attack
me
next
with
her
lavish
caresses
ellen
to
try
to
hinder
me
from
entering
but
i
take
this
walk
every
morning
in
future
may
i
uncle
and
sometimes
bring
papa
wo
you
be
glad
to
see
us
course
replied
the
uncle
with
a
hardly
suppressed
grimace
resulting
from
his
deep
aversion
to
both
the
proposed
visitors
stay
he
continued
turning
towards
the
young
lady
i
think
of
it
i
better
tell
you
linton
has
a
prejudice
against
me
we
quarrelled
at
one
time
of
our
lives
with
unchristian
ferocity
and
if
you
mention
coming
here
to
him
he
put
a
veto
on
your
visits
altogether
therefore
you
must
not
mention
it
unless
you
be
careless
of
seeing
your
cousin
hereafter
you
may
come
if
you
will
but
you
must
not
mention
it
did
you
quarrel
asked
catherine
considerably
crestfallen
thought
me
too
poor
to
wed
his
sister
answered
heathcliff
was
grieved
that
i
got
her
his
pride
was
hurt
and
he
never
forgive
it
wrong
said
the
young
lady
time
i
tell
him
so
but
linton
and
i
have
no
share
in
your
quarrel
i
not
come
here
then
he
shall
come
to
the
grange
will
be
too
far
for
me
murmured
her
cousin
walk
four
miles
would
kill
me
no
come
here
miss
catherine
now
and
then
not
every
morning
but
once
or
twice
a
week
the
father
launched
towards
his
son
a
glance
of
bitter
contempt
am
afraid
nelly
i
shall
lose
my
labour
he
muttered
to
me
catherine
as
the
ninny
calls
her
will
discover
his
value
and
send
him
to
the
devil
now
if
it
had
been
hareton
do
you
know
that
twenty
times
a
day
i
covet
hareton
with
all
his
degradation
i
have
loved
the
lad
had
he
been
some
one
else
but
i
think
he
safe
from
love
i
pit
him
against
that
paltry
creature
unless
it
bestir
itself
briskly
we
calculate
it
will
scarcely
last
till
it
is
eighteen
oh
confound
the
vapid
thing
he
absorbed
in
drying
his
feet
and
never
looks
at
linton
father
answered
the
boy
you
nothing
to
show
your
cousin
anywhere
about
not
even
a
rabbit
or
a
weasel
nest
take
her
into
the
garden
before
you
change
your
shoes
and
into
the
stable
to
see
your
horse
you
rather
sit
here
asked
linton
addressing
cathy
in
a
tone
which
expressed
reluctance
to
move
again
do
know
she
replied
casting
a
longing
look
to
the
door
and
evidently
eager
to
be
active
he
kept
his
seat
and
shrank
closer
to
the
fire
heathcliff
rose
and
went
into
the
kitchen
and
from
thence
to
the
yard
calling
out
for
hareton
hareton
responded
and
presently
the
two
the
young
man
had
been
washing
himself
as
was
visible
by
the
glow
on
his
cheeks
and
his
wetted
hair
i
ask
uncle
cried
miss
cathy
recollecting
the
housekeeper
assertion
is
not
my
cousin
is
he
he
replied
mother
nephew
do
you
like
him
catherine
looked
queer
he
not
a
handsome
lad
he
continued
the
uncivil
little
thing
stood
on
tiptoe
and
whispered
a
sentence
in
heathcliff
ear
he
laughed
hareton
darkened
i
perceived
he
was
very
sensitive
to
suspected
slights
and
had
obviously
a
dim
notion
of
his
inferiority
but
his
master
or
guardian
chased
the
frown
by
exclaiming
be
the
favourite
among
us
hareton
she
says
you
are
a
what
was
it
well
something
very
flattering
here
you
go
with
her
round
the
farm
and
behave
like
a
gentleman
mind
do
use
any
bad
words
and
do
stare
when
the
young
lady
is
not
looking
at
you
and
be
ready
to
hide
your
face
when
she
is
and
when
you
speak
say
your
words
slowly
and
keep
your
hands
out
of
your
pockets
be
off
and
entertain
her
as
nicely
as
you
can
he
watched
the
couple
walking
past
the
window
earnshaw
had
his
countenance
completely
averted
from
his
companion
he
seemed
studying
the
familiar
landscape
with
a
stranger
and
an
artist
interest
catherine
took
a
sly
look
at
him
expressing
small
admiration
she
then
turned
her
attention
to
seeking
out
objects
of
amusement
for
herself
and
tripped
merrily
on
lilting
a
tune
to
supply
the
lack
of
conversation
tied
his
tongue
observed
heathcliff
not
venture
a
single
syllable
all
the
time
nelly
you
recollect
me
at
his
age
nay
some
years
younger
did
i
ever
look
so
stupid
so
gaumless
as
joseph
calls
it
i
replied
more
sullen
with
it
a
pleasure
in
him
he
continued
reflecting
aloud
has
satisfied
my
expectations
if
he
were
a
born
fool
i
should
not
enjoy
it
half
so
much
but
he
no
fool
and
i
can
sympathise
with
all
his
feelings
having
felt
them
myself
i
know
what
he
suffers
now
for
instance
exactly
it
is
merely
a
beginning
of
what
he
shall
suffer
though
and
he
never
be
able
to
emerge
from
his
bathos
of
coarseness
and
ignorance
i
got
him
faster
than
his
scoundrel
of
a
father
secured
me
and
lower
for
he
takes
a
pride
in
his
brutishness
taught
him
to
scorn
everything
as
silly
and
weak
do
you
think
hindley
would
be
proud
of
his
son
if
he
could
see
him
almost
as
proud
as
i
am
of
mine
but
there
this
difference
one
is
gold
put
to
the
use
of
and
the
other
is
tin
polished
to
ape
a
service
of
silver
has
nothing
valuable
about
it
yet
i
shall
have
the
merit
of
making
it
go
as
far
as
such
poor
stuff
can
go
had
qualities
and
they
are
lost
rendered
worse
than
unavailing
i
have
nothing
to
regret
he
would
have
more
than
any
but
i
are
aware
of
and
the
best
of
it
is
hareton
is
damnably
fond
of
me
you
own
that
i
outmatched
hindley
there
if
the
dead
villain
could
rise
from
his
grave
to
abuse
me
for
his
offspring
wrongs
i
should
have
the
fun
of
seeing
the
said
offspring
fight
him
back
again
indignant
that
he
should
dare
to
rail
at
the
one
friend
he
has
in
the
world
heathcliff
chuckled
a
fiendish
laugh
at
the
idea
i
made
no
reply
because
i
saw
that
he
expected
none
meantime
our
young
companion
who
sat
too
removed
from
us
to
hear
what
was
said
began
to
evince
symptoms
of
uneasiness
probably
repenting
that
he
had
denied
himself
the
treat
of
catherine
society
for
fear
of
a
little
fatigue
his
father
remarked
the
restless
glances
wandering
to
the
window
and
the
hand
irresolutely
extended
towards
his
cap
up
you
idle
boy
he
exclaimed
with
assumed
heartiness
after
them
they
are
just
at
the
corner
by
the
stand
of
hives
linton
gathered
his
energies
and
left
the
hearth
the
lattice
was
open
and
as
he
stepped
out
i
heard
cathy
inquiring
of
her
unsociable
attendant
what
was
that
inscription
over
the
door
hareton
stared
up
and
scratched
his
head
like
a
true
clown
some
damnable
writing
he
answered
can
not
read
it
read
it
cried
catherine
can
read
it
it
english
but
i
want
to
know
why
it
is
there
linton
giggled
the
first
appearance
of
mirth
he
had
exhibited
does
not
know
his
letters
he
said
to
his
cousin
you
believe
in
the
existence
of
such
a
colossal
dunce
he
all
as
he
should
be
asked
miss
cathy
seriously
is
he
simple
not
right
i
questioned
him
twice
now
and
each
time
he
looked
so
stupid
i
think
he
does
not
understand
me
i
can
hardly
understand
him
i
sure
linton
repeated
his
laugh
and
glanced
at
hareton
tauntingly
who
certainly
did
not
seem
quite
clear
of
comprehension
at
that
moment
nothing
the
matter
but
laziness
is
there
earnshaw
he
said
cousin
fancies
you
are
an
idiot
there
you
experience
the
consequence
of
scorning
as
you
would
say
have
you
noticed
catherine
his
frightful
yorkshire
pronunciation
where
the
devil
is
the
use
o
growled
hareton
more
ready
in
answering
his
daily
companion
he
was
about
to
enlarge
further
but
the
two
youngsters
broke
into
a
noisy
fit
of
merriment
my
giddy
miss
being
delighted
to
discover
that
she
might
turn
his
strange
talk
to
matter
of
amusement
is
the
use
of
the
devil
in
that
sentence
tittered
linton
told
you
not
to
say
any
bad
words
and
you
ca
open
your
mouth
without
one
do
try
to
behave
like
a
gentleman
now
do
thou
were
more
a
lass
than
a
lad
i
fell
thee
this
minute
i
would
pitiful
lath
of
a
crater
retorted
the
angry
boor
retreating
while
his
face
burnt
with
mingled
rage
and
mortification
for
he
was
conscious
of
being
insulted
and
embarrassed
how
to
resent
it
heathcliff
having
overheard
the
conversation
as
well
as
i
smiled
when
he
saw
him
go
but
immediately
afterwards
cast
a
look
of
singular
aversion
on
the
flippant
pair
who
remained
chattering
in
the
the
boy
finding
animation
enough
while
discussing
hareton
faults
and
deficiencies
and
relating
anecdotes
of
his
goings
on
and
the
girl
relishing
his
pert
and
spiteful
sayings
without
considering
the
they
evinced
i
began
to
dislike
more
than
to
compassionate
linton
and
to
excuse
his
father
in
some
measure
for
holding
him
cheap
we
stayed
till
afternoon
i
could
not
tear
miss
cathy
away
sooner
but
happily
my
master
had
not
quitted
his
apartment
and
remained
ignorant
of
our
prolonged
absence
as
we
walked
home
i
would
fain
have
enlightened
my
charge
on
the
characters
of
the
people
we
had
quitted
but
she
got
it
into
her
head
that
i
was
prejudiced
against
them
she
cried
take
papa
side
ellen
you
are
partial
i
know
or
else
you
would
have
cheated
me
so
many
years
into
the
notion
that
linton
lived
a
long
way
from
here
i
really
extremely
angry
only
so
pleased
i
ca
show
it
but
you
must
hold
your
tongue
about
uncle
he
my
uncle
remember
and
i
scold
papa
for
quarrelling
with
him
and
so
she
ran
on
till
i
relinquished
the
endeavour
to
convince
her
of
her
mistake
she
did
not
mention
the
visit
that
night
because
she
did
not
see
linton
next
day
it
all
came
out
sadly
to
my
chagrin
and
still
i
was
not
altogether
sorry
i
thought
the
burden
of
directing
and
warning
would
be
more
efficiently
borne
by
him
than
me
but
he
was
too
timid
in
giving
satisfactory
reasons
for
his
wish
that
she
should
shun
connection
with
the
household
of
the
heights
and
catherine
liked
good
reasons
for
every
restraint
that
harassed
her
petted
will
she
exclaimed
after
the
morning
salutations
whom
i
saw
yesterday
in
my
walk
on
the
moors
ah
papa
you
started
you
not
done
right
have
you
now
i
saw
but
listen
and
you
shall
hear
how
i
found
you
out
and
ellen
who
is
in
league
with
you
and
yet
pretended
to
pity
me
so
when
i
kept
hoping
and
was
always
disappointed
about
linton
coming
back
she
gave
a
faithful
account
of
her
excursion
and
its
consequences
and
my
master
though
he
cast
more
than
one
reproachful
look
at
me
said
nothing
till
she
had
concluded
then
he
drew
her
to
him
and
asked
if
she
knew
why
he
had
concealed
linton
near
neighbourhood
from
her
could
she
think
it
was
to
deny
her
a
pleasure
that
she
might
harmlessly
enjoy
was
because
you
disliked
heathcliff
she
answered
you
believe
i
care
more
for
my
own
feelings
than
yours
cathy
he
said
it
was
not
because
i
disliked
heathcliff
but
because
heathcliff
dislikes
me
and
is
a
most
diabolical
man
delighting
to
wrong
and
ruin
those
he
hates
if
they
give
him
the
slightest
opportunity
i
knew
that
you
could
not
keep
up
an
acquaintance
with
your
cousin
without
being
brought
into
contact
with
him
and
i
knew
he
would
detest
you
on
my
account
so
for
your
own
good
and
nothing
else
i
took
precautions
that
you
should
not
see
linton
again
i
meant
to
explain
this
some
time
as
you
grew
older
and
i
sorry
i
delayed
it
heathcliff
was
quite
cordial
papa
observed
catherine
not
at
all
convinced
he
did
object
to
our
seeing
each
other
he
said
i
might
come
to
his
house
when
i
pleased
only
i
must
not
tell
you
because
you
had
quarrelled
with
him
and
would
not
forgive
him
for
marrying
aunt
isabella
and
you
wo
are
the
one
to
be
blamed
he
is
willing
to
let
us
be
friends
at
least
linton
and
i
and
you
are
not
my
master
perceiving
that
she
would
not
take
his
word
for
her
evil
disposition
gave
a
hasty
sketch
of
his
conduct
to
isabella
and
the
manner
in
which
wuthering
heights
became
his
property
he
could
not
bear
to
discourse
long
upon
the
topic
for
though
he
spoke
little
of
it
he
still
felt
the
same
horror
and
detestation
of
his
ancient
enemy
that
had
occupied
his
heart
ever
since
death
might
have
been
living
yet
if
it
had
not
been
for
him
was
his
constant
bitter
reflection
and
in
his
eyes
heathcliff
seemed
a
murderer
miss
cathy
conversant
with
no
bad
deeds
except
her
own
slight
acts
of
disobedience
injustice
and
passion
arising
from
hot
temper
and
thoughtlessness
and
repented
of
on
the
day
they
were
committed
was
amazed
at
the
blackness
of
spirit
that
could
brood
on
and
cover
revenge
for
years
and
deliberately
prosecute
its
plans
without
a
visitation
of
remorse
she
appeared
so
deeply
impressed
and
shocked
at
this
new
view
of
human
nature
excluded
from
all
her
studies
and
all
her
ideas
till
now
that
edgar
deemed
it
unnecessary
to
pursue
the
subject
he
merely
added
will
know
hereafter
darling
why
i
wish
you
to
avoid
his
house
and
family
now
return
to
your
old
employments
and
amusements
and
think
no
more
about
them
catherine
kissed
her
father
and
sat
down
quietly
to
her
lessons
for
a
couple
of
hours
according
to
custom
then
she
accompanied
him
into
the
grounds
and
the
whole
day
passed
as
usual
but
in
the
evening
when
she
had
retired
to
her
room
and
i
went
to
help
her
to
undress
i
found
her
crying
on
her
knees
by
the
bedside
fie
silly
child
i
exclaimed
you
had
any
real
griefs
be
ashamed
to
waste
a
tear
on
this
little
contrariety
you
never
had
one
shadow
of
substantial
sorrow
miss
catherine
suppose
for
a
minute
that
master
and
i
were
dead
and
you
were
by
yourself
in
the
world
how
would
you
feel
then
compare
the
present
occasion
with
such
an
affliction
as
that
and
be
thankful
for
the
friends
you
have
instead
of
coveting
more
not
crying
for
myself
ellen
she
answered
for
him
he
expected
to
see
me
again
and
there
he
be
so
disappointed
and
he
wait
for
me
and
i
come
said
i
you
imagine
he
has
thought
as
much
of
you
as
you
have
of
him
has
he
hareton
for
a
companion
not
one
in
a
hundred
would
weep
at
losing
a
relation
they
had
just
seen
twice
for
two
afternoons
linton
will
conjecture
how
it
is
and
trouble
himself
no
further
about
you
may
i
not
write
a
note
to
tell
him
why
i
can
not
come
she
asked
rising
to
her
feet
just
send
those
books
i
promised
to
lend
him
his
books
are
not
as
nice
as
mine
and
he
wanted
to
have
them
extremely
when
i
told
him
how
interesting
they
were
may
i
not
ellen
indeed
no
indeed
replied
i
with
decision
he
would
write
to
you
and
there
never
be
an
end
of
it
no
miss
catherine
the
acquaintance
must
be
dropped
entirely
so
papa
expects
and
i
shall
see
that
it
is
done
how
can
one
little
note
she
recommenced
putting
on
an
imploring
countenance
i
interrupted
not
begin
with
your
little
notes
get
into
bed
she
threw
at
me
a
very
naughty
look
so
naughty
that
i
would
not
kiss
her
at
first
i
covered
her
up
and
shut
her
door
in
great
displeasure
but
repenting
i
returned
softly
and
lo
there
was
miss
standing
at
the
table
with
a
bit
of
blank
paper
before
her
and
a
pencil
in
her
hand
which
she
guiltily
slipped
out
of
sight
on
my
entrance
get
nobody
to
take
that
catherine
i
said
you
write
it
and
at
present
i
shall
put
out
your
candle
i
set
the
extinguisher
on
the
flame
receiving
as
i
did
so
a
slap
on
my
hand
and
a
petulant
thing
i
then
quitted
her
again
and
she
drew
the
bolt
in
one
of
her
worst
most
peevish
humours
the
letter
was
finished
and
forwarded
to
its
destination
by
a
who
came
from
the
village
but
that
i
did
learn
till
some
time
afterwards
weeks
passed
on
and
cathy
recovered
her
temper
though
she
grew
wondrous
fond
of
stealing
off
to
corners
by
herself
and
often
if
i
came
near
her
suddenly
while
reading
she
would
start
and
bend
over
the
book
evidently
desirous
to
hide
it
and
i
detected
edges
of
loose
paper
sticking
out
beyond
the
leaves
she
also
got
a
trick
of
coming
down
early
in
the
morning
and
lingering
about
the
kitchen
as
if
she
were
expecting
the
arrival
of
something
and
she
had
a
small
drawer
in
a
cabinet
in
the
library
which
she
would
trifle
over
for
hours
and
whose
key
she
took
special
care
to
remove
when
she
left
it
one
day
as
she
inspected
this
drawer
i
observed
that
the
playthings
and
trinkets
which
recently
formed
its
contents
were
transmuted
into
bits
of
folded
paper
my
curiosity
and
suspicions
were
roused
i
determined
to
take
a
peep
at
her
mysterious
treasures
so
at
night
as
soon
as
she
and
my
master
were
safe
upstairs
i
searched
and
readily
found
among
my
house
keys
one
that
would
fit
the
lock
having
opened
i
emptied
the
whole
contents
into
my
apron
and
took
them
with
me
to
examine
at
leisure
in
my
own
chamber
though
i
could
not
but
suspect
i
was
still
surprised
to
discover
that
they
were
a
mass
of
correspondence
daily
almost
it
must
have
been
from
linton
heathcliff
answers
to
documents
forwarded
by
her
the
earlier
dated
were
embarrassed
and
short
gradually
however
they
expanded
into
copious
foolish
as
the
age
of
the
writer
rendered
natural
yet
with
touches
here
and
there
which
i
thought
were
borrowed
from
a
more
experienced
source
some
of
them
struck
me
as
singularly
odd
compounds
of
ardour
and
flatness
commencing
in
strong
feeling
and
concluding
in
the
affected
wordy
style
that
a
schoolboy
might
use
to
a
fancied
incorporeal
sweetheart
whether
they
satisfied
cathy
i
do
know
but
they
appeared
very
worthless
trash
to
me
after
turning
over
as
many
as
i
thought
proper
i
tied
them
in
a
handkerchief
and
set
them
aside
relocking
the
vacant
drawer
following
her
habit
my
young
lady
descended
early
and
visited
the
kitchen
i
watched
her
go
to
the
door
on
the
arrival
of
a
certain
little
boy
and
while
the
dairymaid
filled
his
can
she
tucked
something
into
his
jacket
pocket
and
plucked
something
out
i
went
round
by
the
garden
and
laid
wait
for
the
messenger
who
fought
valorously
to
defend
his
trust
and
we
spilt
the
milk
between
us
but
i
succeeded
in
abstracting
the
epistle
and
threatening
serious
consequences
if
he
did
not
look
sharp
home
i
remained
under
the
wall
and
perused
miss
affectionate
composition
it
was
more
simple
and
more
eloquent
than
her
cousin
very
pretty
and
very
silly
i
shook
my
head
and
went
meditating
into
the
house
the
day
being
wet
she
could
not
divert
herself
with
rambling
about
the
park
so
at
the
conclusion
of
her
morning
studies
she
resorted
to
the
solace
of
the
drawer
her
father
sat
reading
at
the
table
and
i
on
purpose
had
sought
a
bit
of
work
in
some
unripped
fringes
of
the
keeping
my
eye
steadily
fixed
on
her
proceedings
never
did
any
bird
flying
back
to
a
plundered
nest
which
it
had
left
brimful
of
chirping
young
ones
express
more
complete
despair
in
its
anguished
cries
and
flutterings
than
she
by
her
single
and
the
change
that
transfigured
her
late
happy
countenance
linton
looked
up
is
the
matter
love
have
you
hurt
yourself
he
said
his
tone
and
look
assured
her
had
not
been
the
discoverer
of
the
hoard
papa
she
gasped
ellen
come
i
sick
i
obeyed
her
summons
and
accompanied
her
out
ellen
you
have
got
them
she
commenced
immediately
dropping
on
her
knees
when
we
were
enclosed
alone
give
them
to
me
and
never
never
do
so
again
do
tell
papa
you
have
not
told
papa
ellen
say
you
have
not
i
been
exceedingly
naughty
but
i
wo
do
it
any
more
with
a
grave
severity
in
my
manner
i
bade
her
stand
up
i
exclaimed
catherine
you
are
tolerably
far
on
it
seems
you
may
well
be
ashamed
of
them
a
fine
bundle
of
trash
you
study
in
your
leisure
hours
to
be
sure
why
it
good
enough
to
be
printed
and
what
do
you
suppose
the
master
will
think
when
i
display
it
before
him
i
shown
it
yet
but
you
need
imagine
i
shall
keep
your
ridiculous
secrets
for
shame
and
you
must
have
led
the
way
in
writing
such
absurdities
he
would
not
have
thought
of
beginning
i
certain
did
i
did
sobbed
cathy
fit
to
break
her
heart
once
think
of
loving
him
till
cried
i
as
scornfully
as
i
could
utter
the
word
did
anybody
ever
hear
the
like
i
might
just
as
well
talk
of
loving
the
miller
who
comes
once
a
year
to
buy
our
corn
pretty
loving
indeed
and
both
times
together
you
have
seen
linton
hardly
four
hours
in
your
life
now
here
is
the
babyish
trash
i
going
with
it
to
the
library
and
we
see
what
your
father
says
to
such
she
sprang
at
her
precious
epistles
but
i
held
them
above
my
head
and
then
she
poured
out
further
frantic
entreaties
that
i
would
burn
them
do
anything
rather
than
show
them
and
being
really
fully
as
much
inclined
to
laugh
as
scold
for
i
esteemed
it
all
girlish
vanity
i
at
length
relented
in
a
measure
and
asked
i
consent
to
burn
them
will
you
promise
faithfully
neither
to
send
nor
receive
a
letter
again
nor
a
book
for
i
perceive
you
have
sent
him
books
nor
locks
of
hair
nor
rings
nor
playthings
do
send
playthings
cried
catherine
her
pride
overcoming
her
shame
anything
at
all
then
my
lady
i
said
you
will
here
i
go
promise
ellen
she
cried
catching
my
dress
put
them
in
the
fire
do
do
but
when
i
proceeded
to
open
a
place
with
the
poker
the
sacrifice
was
too
painful
to
be
borne
she
earnestly
supplicated
that
i
would
spare
her
one
or
two
or
two
ellen
to
keep
for
linton
sake
i
unknotted
the
handkerchief
and
commenced
dropping
them
in
from
an
angle
and
the
flame
curled
up
the
chimney
will
have
one
you
cruel
wretch
she
screamed
darting
her
hand
into
the
fire
and
drawing
forth
some
fragments
at
the
expense
of
her
fingers
well
and
i
will
have
some
to
exhibit
to
papa
i
answered
shaking
back
the
rest
into
the
bundle
and
turning
anew
to
the
door
she
emptied
her
blackened
pieces
into
the
flames
and
motioned
me
to
finish
the
immolation
it
was
done
i
stirred
up
the
ashes
and
interred
them
under
a
shovelful
of
coals
and
she
mutely
and
with
a
sense
of
intense
injury
retired
to
her
private
apartment
i
descended
to
tell
my
master
that
the
young
lady
qualm
of
sickness
was
almost
gone
but
i
judged
it
best
for
her
to
lie
down
a
while
she
would
dine
but
she
reappeared
at
tea
pale
and
red
about
the
eyes
and
marvellously
subdued
in
outward
aspect
next
morning
i
answered
the
letter
by
a
slip
of
paper
inscribed
heathcliff
is
requested
to
send
no
more
notes
to
miss
linton
as
she
will
not
receive
them
and
henceforth
the
little
boy
came
with
vacant
pockets
chapter
xxii
summer
drew
to
an
end
and
early
autumn
it
was
past
michaelmas
but
the
harvest
was
late
that
year
and
a
few
of
our
fields
were
still
uncleared
linton
and
his
daughter
would
frequently
walk
out
among
the
reapers
at
the
carrying
of
the
last
sheaves
they
stayed
till
dusk
and
the
evening
happening
to
be
chill
and
damp
my
master
caught
a
bad
cold
that
settled
obstinately
on
his
lungs
and
confined
him
indoors
throughout
the
whole
of
the
winter
nearly
without
intermission
poor
cathy
frightened
from
her
little
romance
had
been
considerably
sadder
and
duller
since
its
abandonment
and
her
father
insisted
on
her
reading
less
and
taking
more
exercise
she
had
his
companionship
no
longer
i
esteemed
it
a
duty
to
supply
its
lack
as
much
as
possible
with
mine
an
inefficient
substitute
for
i
could
only
spare
two
or
three
hours
from
my
numerous
diurnal
occupations
to
follow
her
footsteps
and
then
my
society
was
obviously
less
desirable
than
his
on
an
afternoon
in
october
or
the
beginning
of
november
a
fresh
watery
afternoon
when
the
turf
and
paths
were
rustling
with
moist
withered
leaves
and
the
cold
blue
sky
was
half
hidden
by
clouds
dark
grey
streamers
rapidly
mounting
from
the
west
and
boding
abundant
rain
i
requested
my
young
lady
to
forego
her
ramble
because
i
was
certain
of
showers
she
refused
and
i
unwillingly
donned
a
cloak
and
took
my
umbrella
to
accompany
her
on
a
stroll
to
the
bottom
of
the
park
a
formal
walk
which
she
generally
affected
if
and
that
she
invariably
was
when
edgar
had
been
worse
than
ordinary
a
thing
never
known
from
his
confession
but
guessed
both
by
her
and
me
from
his
increased
silence
and
the
melancholy
of
his
countenance
she
went
sadly
on
there
was
no
running
or
bounding
now
though
the
chill
wind
might
well
have
tempted
her
to
race
and
often
from
the
side
of
my
eye
i
could
detect
her
raising
a
hand
and
brushing
something
off
her
cheek
i
gazed
round
for
a
means
of
diverting
her
thoughts
on
one
side
of
the
road
rose
a
high
rough
bank
where
hazels
and
stunted
oaks
with
their
roots
half
exposed
held
uncertain
tenure
the
soil
was
too
loose
for
the
latter
and
strong
winds
had
blown
some
nearly
horizontal
in
summer
miss
catherine
delighted
to
climb
along
these
trunks
and
sit
in
the
branches
swinging
twenty
feet
above
the
ground
and
i
pleased
with
her
agility
and
her
light
childish
heart
still
considered
it
proper
to
scold
every
time
i
caught
her
at
such
an
elevation
but
so
that
she
knew
there
was
no
necessity
for
descending
from
dinner
to
tea
she
would
lie
in
her
cradle
doing
nothing
except
singing
old
songs
my
nursery
lore
to
herself
or
watching
the
birds
joint
tenants
feed
and
entice
their
young
ones
to
fly
or
nestling
with
closed
lids
half
thinking
half
dreaming
happier
than
words
can
express
miss
i
exclaimed
pointing
to
a
nook
under
the
roots
of
one
twisted
tree
is
not
here
yet
there
a
little
flower
up
yonder
the
last
bud
from
the
multitude
of
bluebells
that
clouded
those
turf
steps
in
july
with
a
lilac
mist
will
you
clamber
up
and
pluck
it
to
show
to
papa
cathy
stared
a
long
time
at
the
lonely
blossom
trembling
in
its
earthy
shelter
and
replied
at
length
i
not
touch
it
but
it
looks
melancholy
does
it
not
ellen
i
observed
as
starved
and
suckless
as
you
your
cheeks
are
bloodless
let
us
take
hold
of
hands
and
run
you
so
low
i
daresay
i
shall
keep
up
with
you
she
repeated
and
continued
sauntering
on
pausing
at
intervals
to
muse
over
a
bit
of
moss
or
a
tuft
of
blanched
grass
or
a
fungus
spreading
its
bright
orange
among
the
heaps
of
brown
foliage
and
ever
and
anon
her
hand
was
lifted
to
her
averted
face
why
are
you
crying
love
i
asked
approaching
and
putting
my
arm
over
her
shoulder
must
cry
because
papa
has
a
cold
be
thankful
it
is
nothing
worse
she
now
put
no
further
restraint
on
her
tears
her
breath
was
stifled
by
sobs
it
will
be
something
worse
she
said
what
shall
i
do
when
papa
and
you
leave
me
and
i
am
by
myself
i
ca
forget
your
words
ellen
they
are
always
in
my
ear
how
life
will
be
changed
how
dreary
the
world
will
be
when
papa
and
you
are
dead
can
tell
whether
you
wo
die
before
us
i
replied
wrong
to
anticipate
evil
we
hope
there
are
years
and
years
to
come
before
any
of
us
go
master
is
young
and
i
am
strong
and
hardly
my
mother
lived
till
eighty
a
canty
dame
to
the
last
and
suppose
linton
were
spared
till
he
saw
sixty
that
would
be
more
years
than
you
have
counted
miss
and
would
it
not
be
foolish
to
mourn
a
calamity
above
twenty
years
beforehand
aunt
isabella
was
younger
than
papa
she
remarked
gazing
up
with
timid
hope
to
seek
further
consolation
isabella
had
not
you
and
me
to
nurse
her
i
replied
as
happy
as
master
she
had
as
much
to
live
for
all
you
need
do
is
to
wait
well
on
your
father
and
cheer
him
by
letting
him
see
you
cheerful
and
avoid
giving
him
anxiety
on
any
subject
mind
that
cathy
i
not
disguise
but
you
might
kill
him
if
you
were
wild
and
reckless
and
cherished
a
foolish
fanciful
affection
for
the
son
of
a
person
who
would
be
glad
to
have
him
in
his
grave
and
allowed
him
to
discover
that
you
fretted
over
the
separation
he
has
judged
it
expedient
to
make
fret
about
nothing
on
earth
except
papa
illness
answered
my
companion
care
for
nothing
in
comparison
with
papa
and
never
never
oh
never
while
i
have
my
senses
do
an
act
or
say
a
word
to
vex
him
i
love
him
better
than
myself
ellen
and
i
know
it
by
this
i
pray
every
night
that
i
may
live
after
him
because
i
would
rather
be
miserable
than
that
he
should
be
that
proves
i
love
him
better
than
myself
words
i
replied
deeds
must
prove
it
also
and
after
he
is
well
remember
you
do
forget
resolutions
formed
in
the
hour
of
fear
as
we
talked
we
neared
a
door
that
opened
on
the
road
and
my
young
lady
lightening
into
sunshine
again
climbed
up
and
seated
herself
on
the
top
of
the
wall
reaching
over
to
gather
some
hips
that
bloomed
scarlet
on
the
summit
branches
of
the
trees
shadowing
the
highway
side
the
lower
fruit
had
disappeared
but
only
birds
could
touch
the
upper
except
from
cathy
present
station
in
stretching
to
pull
them
her
hat
fell
off
and
as
the
door
was
locked
she
proposed
scrambling
down
to
recover
it
i
bid
her
be
cautious
lest
she
got
a
fall
and
she
nimbly
disappeared
but
the
return
was
no
such
easy
matter
the
stones
were
smooth
and
neatly
cemented
and
the
and
stragglers
could
yield
no
assistance
in
i
like
a
fool
did
recollect
that
till
i
heard
her
laughing
and
exclaiming
you
have
to
fetch
the
key
or
else
i
must
run
round
to
the
porter
lodge
i
ca
scale
the
ramparts
on
this
side
where
you
are
i
answered
have
my
bundle
of
keys
in
my
pocket
perhaps
i
may
manage
to
open
it
if
not
i
go
catherine
amused
herself
with
dancing
to
and
fro
before
the
door
while
i
tried
all
the
large
keys
in
succession
i
had
applied
the
last
and
found
that
none
would
do
so
repeating
my
desire
that
she
would
remain
there
i
was
about
to
hurry
home
as
fast
as
i
could
when
an
approaching
sound
arrested
me
it
was
the
trot
of
a
horse
cathy
dance
stopped
also
is
that
i
whispered
i
wish
you
could
open
the
door
whispered
back
my
companion
anxiously
miss
linton
cried
a
deep
voice
the
rider
glad
to
meet
you
do
be
in
haste
to
enter
for
i
have
an
explanation
to
ask
and
obtain
speak
to
you
heathcliff
answered
catherine
says
you
are
a
wicked
man
and
you
hate
both
him
and
me
and
ellen
says
the
same
is
nothing
to
the
purpose
said
heathcliff
he
it
was
do
hate
my
son
i
suppose
and
it
is
concerning
him
that
i
demand
your
attention
yes
you
have
cause
to
blush
two
or
three
months
since
were
you
not
in
the
habit
of
writing
to
linton
making
love
in
play
eh
you
deserved
both
of
you
flogging
for
that
you
especially
the
elder
and
less
sensitive
as
it
turns
out
i
got
your
letters
and
if
you
give
me
any
pertness
i
send
them
to
your
father
i
presume
you
grew
weary
of
the
amusement
and
dropped
it
did
you
well
you
dropped
linton
with
it
into
a
slough
of
despond
he
was
in
earnest
in
love
really
as
true
as
i
live
he
dying
for
you
breaking
his
heart
at
your
fickleness
not
figuratively
but
actually
though
hareton
has
made
him
a
standing
jest
for
six
weeks
and
i
have
used
more
serious
measures
and
attempted
to
frighten
him
out
of
his
idiotcy
he
gets
worse
daily
and
he
be
under
the
sod
before
summer
unless
you
restore
him
can
you
lie
so
glaringly
to
the
poor
child
i
called
from
the
inside
ride
on
how
can
you
deliberately
get
up
such
paltry
falsehoods
miss
cathy
i
knock
the
lock
off
with
a
stone
you
believe
that
vile
nonsense
you
can
feel
in
yourself
it
is
impossible
that
a
person
should
die
for
love
of
a
stranger
was
not
aware
there
were
eavesdroppers
muttered
the
detected
villain
dean
i
like
you
but
i
do
like
your
he
added
aloud
could
lie
so
glaringly
as
to
affirm
i
hated
the
poor
child
and
invent
bugbear
stories
to
terrify
her
from
my
catherine
linton
the
very
name
warms
me
my
bonny
lass
i
shall
be
from
home
all
this
week
go
and
see
if
have
not
spoken
truth
do
there
a
darling
just
imagine
your
father
in
my
place
and
linton
in
yours
then
think
how
you
would
value
your
careless
lover
if
he
refused
to
stir
a
step
to
comfort
you
when
your
father
himself
entreated
him
and
do
from
pure
stupidity
fall
into
the
same
error
i
swear
on
my
salvation
he
going
to
his
grave
and
none
but
you
can
save
him
the
lock
gave
way
and
i
issued
out
swear
linton
is
dying
repeated
heathcliff
looking
hard
at
me
grief
and
disappointment
are
hastening
his
death
nelly
if
you
let
her
go
you
can
walk
over
yourself
but
i
shall
not
return
till
this
time
next
week
and
i
think
your
master
himself
would
scarcely
object
to
her
visiting
her
cousin
in
said
i
taking
cathy
by
the
arm
and
half
forcing
her
to
for
she
lingered
viewing
with
troubled
eyes
the
features
of
the
speaker
too
stern
to
express
his
inward
deceit
he
pushed
his
horse
close
and
bending
down
observed
catherine
i
own
to
you
that
i
have
little
patience
with
linton
and
hareton
and
joseph
have
less
i
own
that
he
with
a
harsh
set
he
pines
for
kindness
as
well
as
love
and
a
kind
word
from
you
would
be
his
best
medicine
do
mind
dean
cruel
cautions
but
be
generous
and
contrive
to
see
him
he
dreams
of
you
day
and
night
and
can
not
be
persuaded
that
you
do
hate
him
since
you
neither
write
nor
call
i
closed
the
door
and
rolled
a
stone
to
assist
the
loosened
lock
in
holding
it
and
spreading
my
umbrella
i
drew
my
charge
underneath
for
the
rain
began
to
drive
through
the
moaning
branches
of
the
trees
and
warned
us
to
avoid
delay
our
hurry
prevented
any
comment
on
the
encounter
with
heathcliff
as
we
stretched
towards
home
but
i
divined
instinctively
that
catherine
heart
was
clouded
now
in
double
darkness
her
features
were
so
sad
they
did
not
seem
hers
she
evidently
regarded
what
she
had
heard
as
every
syllable
true
the
master
had
retired
to
rest
before
we
came
in
cathy
stole
to
his
room
to
inquire
how
he
was
he
had
fallen
asleep
she
returned
and
asked
me
to
sit
with
her
in
the
library
we
took
our
tea
together
and
afterwards
she
lay
down
on
the
rug
and
told
me
not
to
talk
for
she
was
weary
i
got
a
book
and
pretended
to
read
as
soon
as
she
supposed
me
absorbed
in
my
occupation
she
recommenced
her
silent
weeping
it
appeared
at
present
her
favourite
diversion
i
suffered
her
to
enjoy
it
a
while
then
i
expostulated
deriding
and
ridiculing
all
heathcliff
assertions
about
his
son
as
if
i
were
certain
she
would
coincide
alas
i
had
skill
to
counteract
the
effect
his
account
had
produced
it
was
just
what
he
intended
may
be
right
ellen
she
answered
i
shall
never
feel
at
ease
till
i
know
and
i
must
tell
linton
it
is
not
my
fault
that
i
write
and
convince
him
that
i
shall
not
change
what
use
were
anger
and
protestations
against
her
silly
credulity
we
parted
that
night
hostile
but
next
day
beheld
me
on
the
road
to
wuthering
heights
by
the
side
of
my
wilful
young
mistress
pony
i
could
bear
to
witness
her
sorrow
to
see
her
pale
dejected
countenance
and
heavy
eyes
and
i
yielded
in
the
faint
hope
that
linton
himself
might
prove
by
his
reception
of
us
how
little
of
the
tale
was
founded
on
fact
chapter
xxiii
the
rainy
night
had
ushered
in
a
misty
morning
half
frost
half
drizzle
and
temporary
brooks
crossed
our
path
gurgling
from
the
uplands
my
feet
were
thoroughly
wetted
i
was
cross
and
low
exactly
the
humour
suited
for
making
the
most
of
these
disagreeable
things
we
entered
the
by
the
kitchen
way
to
ascertain
whether
heathcliff
were
really
absent
because
i
put
slight
faith
in
his
own
affirmation
joseph
seemed
sitting
in
a
sort
of
elysium
alone
beside
a
roaring
fire
a
quart
of
ale
on
the
table
near
him
bristling
with
large
pieces
of
toasted
and
his
black
short
pipe
in
his
mouth
catherine
ran
to
the
hearth
to
warm
herself
i
asked
if
the
master
was
in
my
question
remained
so
long
unanswered
that
i
thought
the
old
man
had
grown
deaf
and
repeated
it
louder
ay
he
snarled
or
rather
screamed
through
his
nose
ay
yah
muh
goa
back
whear
yah
coom
frough
cried
a
peevish
voice
simultaneously
with
me
from
the
inner
room
often
am
i
to
call
you
there
are
only
a
few
red
ashes
now
joseph
come
this
moment
vigorous
puffs
and
a
resolute
stare
into
the
grate
declared
he
had
no
ear
for
this
appeal
the
housekeeper
and
hareton
were
invisible
one
gone
on
an
errand
and
the
other
at
his
work
probably
we
knew
tones
and
entered
i
hope
you
die
in
a
garret
starved
to
death
said
the
boy
mistaking
our
approach
for
that
of
his
negligent
attendant
he
stopped
on
observing
his
error
his
cousin
flew
to
him
that
you
miss
linton
he
said
raising
his
head
from
the
arm
of
the
great
chair
in
which
he
reclined
do
kiss
me
it
takes
my
breath
dear
me
papa
said
you
would
call
continued
he
after
recovering
a
little
from
catherine
embrace
while
she
stood
by
looking
very
contrite
you
shut
the
door
if
you
please
you
left
it
open
and
those
those
creatures
wo
bring
coals
to
the
fire
it
so
cold
i
stirred
up
the
cinders
and
fetched
a
scuttleful
myself
the
invalid
complained
of
being
covered
with
ashes
but
he
had
a
tiresome
cough
and
looked
feverish
and
ill
so
i
did
not
rebuke
his
temper
linton
murmured
catherine
when
his
corrugated
brow
relaxed
you
glad
to
see
me
can
i
do
you
any
good
did
you
come
before
he
asked
should
have
come
instead
of
writing
it
tired
me
dreadfully
writing
those
long
letters
i
far
rather
have
talked
to
you
now
i
can
neither
bear
to
talk
nor
anything
else
i
wonder
where
zillah
is
will
you
looking
at
me
into
the
kitchen
and
see
i
had
received
no
thanks
for
my
other
service
and
being
unwilling
to
run
to
and
fro
at
his
behest
i
replied
is
out
there
but
joseph
want
to
drink
he
exclaimed
fretfully
turning
away
is
constantly
gadding
off
to
gimmerton
since
papa
went
it
miserable
and
i
obliged
to
come
down
here
they
resolved
never
to
hear
me
your
father
attentive
to
you
master
heathcliff
i
asked
perceiving
catherine
to
be
checked
in
her
friendly
advances
he
makes
them
a
little
more
attentive
at
least
he
cried
wretches
do
you
know
miss
linton
that
brute
hareton
laughs
at
me
i
hate
him
indeed
i
hate
them
all
they
are
odious
beings
cathy
began
searching
for
some
water
she
lighted
on
a
pitcher
in
the
dresser
filled
a
tumbler
and
brought
it
he
bid
her
add
a
spoonful
of
wine
from
a
bottle
on
the
table
and
having
swallowed
a
small
portion
appeared
more
tranquil
and
said
she
was
very
kind
are
you
glad
to
see
me
asked
she
reiterating
her
former
question
and
pleased
to
detect
the
faint
dawn
of
a
smile
i
am
it
something
new
to
hear
a
voice
like
yours
he
replied
i
have
been
vexed
because
you
would
come
and
papa
swore
it
was
owing
to
me
he
called
me
a
pitiful
shuffling
worthless
thing
and
said
you
despised
me
and
if
he
had
been
in
my
place
he
would
be
more
the
master
of
the
grange
than
your
father
by
this
time
but
you
despise
me
do
you
miss
wish
you
would
say
catherine
or
cathy
interrupted
my
young
lady
you
no
next
to
papa
and
ellen
i
love
you
better
than
anybody
living
i
do
love
heathcliff
though
and
i
dare
not
come
when
he
returns
will
he
stay
away
many
days
many
answered
linton
he
goes
on
to
the
moors
frequently
since
the
shooting
season
commenced
and
you
might
spend
an
hour
or
two
with
me
in
his
absence
do
say
you
will
i
think
i
should
not
be
peevish
with
you
you
not
provoke
me
and
you
always
be
ready
to
help
me
would
you
said
catherine
stroking
his
long
soft
hair
i
could
only
get
papa
consent
i
spend
half
my
time
with
you
pretty
linton
i
wish
you
were
my
brother
then
you
would
like
me
as
well
as
your
father
observed
he
more
cheerfully
papa
says
you
would
love
me
better
than
him
and
all
the
world
if
you
were
my
wife
so
i
rather
you
were
that
i
should
never
love
anybody
better
than
papa
she
returned
gravely
people
hate
their
wives
sometimes
but
not
their
sisters
and
brothers
and
if
you
were
the
latter
you
would
live
with
us
and
papa
would
be
as
fond
of
you
as
he
is
of
me
linton
denied
that
people
ever
hated
their
wives
but
cathy
affirmed
they
did
and
in
her
wisdom
instanced
his
own
father
aversion
to
her
aunt
i
endeavoured
to
stop
her
thoughtless
tongue
i
could
succeed
till
everything
she
knew
was
out
master
heathcliff
much
irritated
asserted
her
relation
was
false
told
me
and
papa
does
not
tell
falsehoods
she
answered
pertly
papa
scorns
yours
cried
linton
calls
him
a
sneaking
fool
is
a
wicked
man
retorted
catherine
you
are
very
naughty
to
dare
to
repeat
what
he
says
he
must
be
wicked
to
have
made
aunt
isabella
leave
him
as
she
did
did
leave
him
said
the
boy
contradict
me
did
cried
my
young
lady
i
tell
you
something
said
linton
mother
hated
your
father
now
then
exclaimed
catherine
too
enraged
to
continue
she
loved
mine
added
he
little
liar
i
hate
you
now
she
panted
and
her
face
grew
red
with
passion
did
she
did
sang
linton
sinking
into
the
recess
of
his
chair
and
leaning
back
his
head
to
enjoy
the
agitation
of
the
other
disputant
who
stood
behind
master
heathcliff
i
said
your
father
tale
too
i
suppose
is
you
hold
your
tongue
he
answered
did
she
did
catherine
she
did
she
did
cathy
beside
herself
gave
the
chair
a
violent
push
and
caused
him
to
fall
against
one
arm
he
was
immediately
seized
by
a
suffocating
cough
that
soon
ended
his
triumph
it
lasted
so
long
that
it
frightened
even
me
as
to
his
cousin
she
wept
with
all
her
might
aghast
at
the
mischief
she
had
done
though
she
said
nothing
i
held
him
till
the
fit
exhausted
itself
then
he
thrust
me
away
and
leant
his
head
down
silently
catherine
quelled
her
lamentations
also
took
a
seat
opposite
and
looked
solemnly
into
the
fire
do
you
feel
now
master
heathcliff
i
inquired
after
waiting
ten
minutes
wish
felt
as
i
do
he
replied
cruel
thing
hareton
never
touches
me
he
never
struck
me
in
his
life
and
i
was
better
and
there
his
voice
died
in
a
whimper
did
strike
you
muttered
cathy
chewing
her
lip
to
prevent
another
burst
of
emotion
he
sighed
and
moaned
like
one
under
great
suffering
and
kept
it
up
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
on
purpose
to
distress
his
cousin
apparently
for
whenever
he
caught
a
stifled
sob
from
her
he
put
renewed
pain
and
pathos
into
the
inflexions
of
his
voice
sorry
i
hurt
you
linton
she
said
at
length
racked
beyond
endurance
i
could
have
been
hurt
by
that
little
push
and
i
had
no
idea
that
you
could
either
you
not
much
are
you
linton
let
me
go
home
thinking
i
done
you
harm
answer
speak
to
me
ca
speak
to
you
he
murmured
hurt
me
so
that
i
shall
lie
awake
all
night
choking
with
this
cough
if
you
had
it
you
know
what
it
was
but
be
comfortably
asleep
while
i
in
agony
and
nobody
near
me
i
wonder
how
you
would
like
to
pass
those
fearful
nights
and
he
began
to
wail
aloud
for
very
pity
of
himself
you
are
in
the
habit
of
passing
dreadful
nights
i
said
wo
be
miss
who
spoils
your
ease
you
be
the
same
had
she
never
come
however
she
shall
not
disturb
you
again
and
perhaps
you
get
quieter
when
we
leave
you
i
go
asked
catherine
dolefully
bending
over
him
you
want
me
to
go
linton
ca
alter
what
you
done
he
replied
pettishly
shrinking
from
her
you
alter
it
for
the
worse
by
teasing
me
into
a
fever
then
i
must
go
she
repeated
me
alone
at
least
said
he
ca
bear
your
talking
she
lingered
and
resisted
my
persuasions
to
departure
a
tiresome
while
but
as
he
neither
looked
up
nor
spoke
she
finally
made
a
movement
to
the
door
and
i
followed
we
were
recalled
by
a
scream
linton
had
slid
from
his
seat
on
to
the
hearthstone
and
lay
writhing
in
the
mere
perverseness
of
an
indulged
plague
of
a
child
determined
to
be
as
grievous
and
harassing
as
it
can
i
thoroughly
gauged
his
disposition
from
his
behaviour
and
saw
at
once
it
would
be
folly
to
attempt
humouring
him
not
so
my
companion
she
ran
back
in
terror
knelt
down
and
cried
and
soothed
and
entreated
till
he
grew
quiet
from
lack
of
breath
by
no
means
from
compunction
at
distressing
her
shall
lift
him
on
to
the
settle
i
said
he
may
roll
about
as
he
pleases
we
ca
stop
to
watch
him
i
hope
you
are
satisfied
miss
cathy
that
you
are
not
the
person
to
benefit
him
and
that
his
condition
of
health
is
not
occasioned
by
attachment
to
you
now
then
there
he
is
come
away
as
soon
as
he
knows
there
is
nobody
by
to
care
for
his
nonsense
he
be
glad
to
lie
still
she
placed
a
cushion
under
his
head
and
offered
him
some
water
he
rejected
the
latter
and
tossed
uneasily
on
the
former
as
if
it
were
a
stone
or
a
block
of
wood
she
tried
to
put
it
more
comfortably
ca
do
with
that
he
said
not
high
enough
catherine
brought
another
to
lay
above
it
too
high
murmured
the
provoking
thing
must
i
arrange
it
then
she
asked
despairingly
he
twined
himself
up
to
her
as
she
half
knelt
by
the
settle
and
converted
her
shoulder
into
a
support
that
wo
do
i
said
be
content
with
the
cushion
master
heathcliff
miss
has
wasted
too
much
time
on
you
already
we
can
not
remain
five
minutes
longer
yes
we
can
replied
cathy
good
and
patient
now
beginning
to
think
i
shall
have
far
greater
misery
than
he
will
if
i
believe
he
is
the
worse
for
my
visit
and
then
i
dare
not
come
again
tell
the
truth
about
it
linton
for
i
mus
come
if
i
have
hurt
you
must
come
to
cure
me
he
answered
ought
to
come
because
you
have
hurt
me
you
know
you
have
extremely
i
was
not
as
ill
when
you
entered
as
i
am
at
present
was
i
you
made
yourself
ill
by
crying
and
being
in
a
i
do
it
all
said
his
cousin
we
be
friends
now
and
you
want
me
you
would
wish
to
see
me
sometimes
really
told
you
i
did
he
replied
impatiently
on
the
settle
and
let
me
lean
on
your
knee
that
as
mamma
used
to
do
whole
afternoons
together
sit
quite
still
and
do
talk
but
you
may
sing
a
song
if
you
can
sing
or
you
may
say
a
nice
long
interesting
ballad
one
of
those
you
promised
to
teach
me
or
a
story
i
rather
have
a
ballad
though
begin
catherine
repeated
the
longest
she
could
remember
the
employment
pleased
both
mightily
linton
would
have
another
and
after
that
another
notwithstanding
my
strenuous
objections
and
so
they
went
on
until
the
clock
struck
twelve
and
we
heard
hareton
in
the
court
returning
for
his
dinner
catherine
will
you
be
here
asked
young
heathcliff
holding
her
frock
as
she
rose
reluctantly
i
answered
next
day
neither
she
however
gave
a
different
response
evidently
for
his
forehead
cleared
as
she
stooped
and
whispered
in
his
ear
wo
go
recollect
miss
i
commenced
when
we
were
out
of
the
house
are
not
dreaming
of
it
are
you
she
smiled
i
take
good
care
i
continued
have
that
lock
mended
and
you
can
escape
by
no
way
else
can
get
over
the
wall
she
said
laughing
grange
is
not
a
prison
ellen
and
you
are
not
my
gaoler
and
besides
i
almost
seventeen
i
a
woman
and
i
certain
linton
would
recover
quickly
if
he
had
me
to
look
after
him
i
older
than
he
is
you
know
and
wiser
less
childish
am
i
not
and
he
soon
do
as
i
direct
him
with
some
slight
coaxing
he
a
pretty
little
darling
when
he
good
i
make
such
a
pet
of
him
if
he
were
mine
we
should
never
quarrel
should
we
after
we
were
used
to
each
other
do
you
like
him
ellen
him
i
exclaimed
bit
of
a
sickly
slip
that
ever
struggled
into
its
teens
happily
as
heathcliff
conjectured
he
not
win
twenty
i
doubt
whether
he
see
spring
indeed
and
small
loss
to
his
family
whenever
he
drops
off
and
lucky
it
is
for
us
that
his
father
took
him
the
kinder
he
was
treated
the
more
tedious
and
selfish
he
be
i
glad
you
have
no
chance
of
having
him
for
a
husband
miss
catherine
my
companion
waxed
serious
at
hearing
this
speech
to
speak
of
his
death
so
regardlessly
wounded
her
feelings
younger
than
i
she
answered
after
a
protracted
pause
of
meditation
he
ought
to
live
the
longest
he
will
he
must
live
as
long
as
i
do
he
as
strong
now
as
when
he
first
came
into
the
north
i
positive
of
that
it
only
a
cold
that
ails
him
the
same
as
papa
has
you
say
papa
will
get
better
and
why
should
he
well
i
cried
all
we
need
trouble
ourselves
for
listen
miss
and
mind
i
keep
my
word
if
you
attempt
going
to
wuthering
heights
again
with
or
without
me
i
shall
inform
linton
and
unless
he
allow
it
the
intimacy
with
your
cousin
must
not
be
revived
has
been
revived
muttered
cathy
sulkily
not
be
continued
then
i
said
see
was
her
reply
and
she
set
off
at
a
gallop
leaving
me
to
toil
in
the
rear
we
both
reached
home
before
our
my
master
supposed
we
had
been
wandering
through
the
park
and
therefore
he
demanded
no
explanation
of
our
absence
as
soon
as
i
entered
i
hastened
to
change
my
soaked
shoes
and
stockings
but
sitting
such
awhile
at
the
heights
had
done
the
mischief
on
the
succeeding
morning
i
was
laid
up
and
during
three
weeks
i
remained
incapacitated
for
attending
to
my
duties
a
calamity
never
experienced
prior
to
that
period
and
never
i
am
thankful
to
say
since
my
little
mistress
behaved
like
an
angel
in
coming
to
wait
on
me
and
cheer
my
solitude
the
confinement
brought
me
exceedingly
low
it
is
wearisome
to
a
stirring
active
body
but
few
have
slighter
reasons
for
complaint
than
i
had
the
moment
catherine
left
linton
room
she
appeared
at
my
bedside
her
day
was
divided
between
us
no
amusement
usurped
a
minute
she
neglected
her
meals
her
studies
and
her
play
and
she
was
the
fondest
nurse
that
ever
watched
she
must
have
had
a
warm
heart
when
she
loved
her
father
so
to
give
so
much
to
me
i
said
her
days
were
divided
between
us
but
the
master
retired
early
and
i
generally
needed
nothing
after
six
thus
the
evening
was
her
own
poor
thing
i
never
considered
what
she
did
with
herself
after
tea
and
though
frequently
when
she
looked
in
to
bid
me
i
remarked
a
fresh
colour
in
her
cheeks
and
a
pinkness
over
her
slender
fingers
instead
of
fancying
the
line
borrowed
from
a
cold
ride
across
the
moors
i
laid
it
to
the
charge
of
a
hot
fire
in
the
library
chapter
xxiv
at
the
close
of
three
weeks
i
was
able
to
quit
my
chamber
and
move
about
the
house
and
on
the
first
occasion
of
my
sitting
up
in
the
evening
i
asked
catherine
to
read
to
me
because
my
eyes
were
weak
we
were
in
the
library
the
master
having
gone
to
bed
she
consented
rather
unwillingly
i
fancied
and
imagining
my
sort
of
books
did
not
suit
her
i
bid
her
please
herself
in
the
choice
of
what
she
perused
she
selected
one
of
her
own
favourites
and
got
forward
steadily
about
an
hour
then
came
frequent
questions
are
not
you
tired
had
you
better
lie
down
now
you
be
sick
keeping
up
so
long
ellen
no
dear
i
not
tired
i
returned
continually
perceiving
me
immovable
she
essayed
another
method
of
showing
her
disrelish
for
her
occupation
it
changed
to
yawning
and
stretching
and
i
tired
over
then
and
talk
i
answered
that
was
worse
she
fretted
and
sighed
and
looked
at
her
watch
till
eight
and
finally
went
to
her
room
completely
overdone
with
sleep
judging
by
her
peevish
heavy
look
and
the
constant
rubbing
she
inflicted
on
her
eyes
the
following
night
she
seemed
more
impatient
still
and
on
the
third
from
recovering
my
company
she
complained
of
a
headache
and
left
me
i
thought
her
conduct
odd
and
having
remained
alone
a
long
while
i
resolved
on
going
and
inquiring
whether
she
were
better
and
asking
her
to
come
and
lie
on
the
sofa
instead
of
in
the
dark
no
catherine
could
i
discover
and
none
below
the
servants
affirmed
they
had
not
seen
her
i
listened
at
door
all
was
silence
i
returned
to
her
apartment
extinguished
my
candle
and
seated
myself
in
the
window
the
moon
shone
bright
a
sprinkling
of
snow
covered
the
ground
and
i
reflected
that
she
might
possibly
have
taken
it
into
her
head
to
walk
about
the
garden
for
refreshment
i
did
detect
a
figure
creeping
along
the
inner
fence
of
the
park
but
it
was
not
my
young
mistress
on
its
emerging
into
the
light
i
recognised
one
of
the
grooms
he
stood
a
considerable
period
viewing
the
through
the
grounds
then
started
off
at
a
brisk
pace
as
if
he
had
detected
something
and
reappeared
presently
leading
miss
pony
and
there
she
was
just
dismounted
and
walking
by
its
side
the
man
took
his
charge
stealthily
across
the
grass
towards
the
stable
cathy
entered
by
the
of
the
and
glided
noiselessly
up
to
where
i
awaited
her
she
put
the
door
gently
too
slipped
off
her
snowy
shoes
untied
her
hat
and
was
proceeding
unconscious
of
my
espionage
to
lay
aside
her
mantle
when
i
suddenly
rose
and
revealed
myself
the
surprise
petrified
her
an
instant
she
uttered
an
inarticulate
exclamation
and
stood
fixed
dear
miss
catherine
i
began
too
vividly
impressed
by
her
recent
kindness
to
break
into
a
scold
have
you
been
riding
out
at
this
hour
and
why
should
you
try
to
deceive
me
by
telling
a
tale
where
have
you
been
speak
the
bottom
of
the
park
she
stammered
did
tell
a
tale
nowhere
else
i
demanded
was
the
muttered
reply
catherine
i
cried
sorrowfully
know
you
have
been
doing
wrong
or
you
would
be
driven
to
uttering
an
untruth
to
me
that
does
grieve
me
i
rather
be
three
months
ill
than
hear
you
frame
a
deliberate
lie
she
sprang
forward
and
bursting
into
tears
threw
her
arms
round
my
neck
ellen
i
so
afraid
of
you
being
angry
she
said
not
to
be
angry
and
you
shall
know
the
very
truth
i
hate
to
hide
it
we
sat
down
in
the
i
assured
her
i
would
not
scold
whatever
her
secret
might
be
and
i
guessed
it
of
course
so
she
commenced
been
to
wuthering
heights
ellen
and
i
never
missed
going
a
day
since
you
fell
ill
except
thrice
before
and
twice
after
you
left
your
room
i
gave
michael
books
and
pictures
to
prepare
minny
every
evening
and
to
put
her
back
in
the
stable
you
must
scold
him
either
mind
i
was
at
the
heights
by
six
and
generally
stayed
till
eight
and
then
galloped
home
it
was
not
to
amuse
myself
that
i
went
i
was
often
wretched
all
the
time
now
and
then
i
was
happy
once
in
a
week
perhaps
at
first
i
expected
there
would
be
sad
work
persuading
you
to
let
me
keep
my
word
to
linton
for
i
had
engaged
to
call
again
next
day
when
we
quitted
him
but
as
you
stayed
on
the
morrow
i
escaped
that
trouble
while
michael
was
refastening
the
lock
of
the
park
door
in
the
afternoon
i
got
possession
of
the
key
and
told
him
how
my
cousin
wished
me
to
visit
him
because
he
was
sick
and
could
come
to
the
grange
and
how
papa
would
object
to
my
going
and
then
i
negotiated
with
him
about
the
pony
he
is
fond
of
reading
and
he
thinks
of
leaving
soon
to
get
married
so
he
offered
if
i
would
lend
him
books
out
of
the
library
to
do
what
i
wished
but
i
preferred
giving
him
my
own
and
that
satisfied
him
better
my
second
visit
linton
seemed
in
lively
spirits
and
zillah
that
is
their
housekeeper
made
us
a
clean
room
and
a
good
fire
and
told
us
that
as
joseph
was
out
at
a
and
hareton
earnshaw
was
off
with
his
dogs
robbing
our
woods
of
pheasants
as
i
heard
afterwards
we
might
do
what
we
liked
she
brought
me
some
warm
wine
and
gingerbread
and
appeared
exceedingly
and
linton
sat
in
the
and
i
in
the
little
rocking
chair
on
the
and
we
laughed
and
talked
so
merrily
and
found
so
much
to
say
we
planned
where
we
would
go
and
what
we
would
do
in
summer
i
need
repeat
that
because
you
would
call
it
silly
time
however
we
were
near
quarrelling
he
said
the
pleasantest
manner
of
spending
a
hot
july
day
was
lying
from
morning
till
evening
on
a
bank
of
heath
in
the
middle
of
the
moors
with
the
bees
humming
dreamily
about
among
the
bloom
and
the
larks
singing
high
up
overhead
and
the
blue
sky
and
bright
sun
shining
steadily
and
cloudlessly
that
was
his
most
perfect
idea
of
heaven
happiness
mine
was
rocking
in
a
rustling
green
tree
with
a
west
wind
blowing
and
bright
white
clouds
flitting
rapidly
above
and
not
only
larks
but
throstles
and
blackbirds
and
linnets
and
cuckoos
pouring
out
music
on
every
side
and
the
moors
seen
at
a
distance
broken
into
cool
dusky
dells
but
close
by
great
swells
of
long
grass
undulating
in
waves
to
the
breeze
and
woods
and
sounding
water
and
the
whole
world
awake
and
wild
with
joy
he
wanted
all
to
lie
in
an
ecstasy
of
peace
i
wanted
all
to
sparkle
and
dance
in
a
glorious
jubilee
i
said
his
heaven
would
be
only
half
alive
and
he
said
mine
would
be
drunk
i
said
i
should
fall
asleep
in
his
and
he
said
he
could
not
breathe
in
mine
and
began
to
grow
very
snappish
at
last
we
agreed
to
try
both
as
soon
as
the
right
weather
came
and
then
we
kissed
each
other
and
were
friends
sitting
still
an
hour
i
looked
at
the
great
room
with
its
smooth
uncarpeted
floor
and
thought
how
nice
it
would
be
to
play
in
if
we
removed
the
table
and
i
asked
linton
to
call
zillah
in
to
help
us
and
we
have
a
game
at
she
should
try
to
catch
us
you
used
to
you
know
ellen
he
would
there
was
no
pleasure
in
it
he
said
but
he
consented
to
play
at
ball
with
me
we
found
two
in
a
cupboard
among
a
heap
of
old
toys
tops
and
hoops
and
battledores
and
shuttlecocks
one
was
marked
and
the
other
i
wished
to
have
the
because
that
stood
for
catherine
and
the
might
be
for
heathcliff
his
name
but
the
bran
came
out
of
and
linton
did
like
it
i
beat
him
constantly
and
he
got
cross
again
and
coughed
and
returned
to
his
chair
that
night
though
he
easily
recovered
his
good
humour
he
was
charmed
with
two
or
three
pretty
songs
songs
ellen
and
when
i
was
obliged
to
go
he
begged
and
entreated
me
to
come
the
following
evening
and
i
promised
minny
and
i
went
flying
home
as
light
as
air
and
i
dreamt
of
wuthering
heights
and
my
sweet
darling
cousin
till
morning
the
morrow
i
was
sad
partly
because
you
were
poorly
and
partly
that
i
wished
my
father
knew
and
approved
of
my
excursions
but
it
was
beautiful
moonlight
after
tea
and
as
i
rode
on
the
gloom
cleared
i
shall
have
another
happy
evening
i
thought
to
myself
and
what
delights
me
more
my
pretty
linton
will
i
trotted
up
their
garden
and
was
turning
round
to
the
back
when
that
fellow
earnshaw
met
me
took
my
bridle
and
bid
me
go
in
by
the
front
entrance
he
patted
minny
neck
and
said
she
was
a
bonny
beast
and
appeared
as
if
he
wanted
me
to
speak
to
him
i
only
told
him
to
leave
my
horse
alone
or
else
it
would
kick
him
he
answered
in
his
vulgar
accent
it
would
do
mitch
hurt
if
it
did
and
surveyed
its
legs
with
a
smile
i
was
half
inclined
to
make
it
try
however
he
moved
off
to
open
the
door
and
as
he
raised
the
latch
he
looked
up
to
the
inscription
above
and
said
with
a
stupid
mixture
of
awkwardness
and
elation
miss
catherine
i
can
read
yon
now
wonderful
i
exclaimed
pray
let
us
hear
you
you
grown
clever
spelt
and
drawled
over
by
syllables
the
name
hareton
earnshaw
and
the
figures
i
cried
encouragingly
perceiving
that
he
came
to
a
dead
halt
i
can
not
tell
them
yet
he
answered
oh
you
dunce
i
said
laughing
heartily
at
his
failure
fool
stared
with
a
grin
hovering
about
his
lips
and
a
scowl
gathering
over
his
eyes
as
if
uncertain
whether
he
might
not
join
in
my
mirth
whether
it
were
not
pleasant
familiarity
or
what
it
really
was
contempt
i
settled
his
doubts
by
suddenly
retrieving
my
gravity
and
desiring
him
to
walk
away
for
i
came
to
see
linton
not
him
he
reddened
i
saw
that
by
the
moonlight
dropped
his
hand
from
the
latch
and
skulked
off
a
picture
of
mortified
vanity
he
imagined
himself
to
be
as
accomplished
as
linton
i
suppose
because
he
could
spell
his
own
name
and
was
marvellously
discomfited
that
i
did
think
the
same
miss
catherine
dear
i
interrupted
shall
not
scold
but
i
do
like
your
conduct
there
if
you
had
remembered
that
hareton
was
your
cousin
as
much
as
master
heathcliff
you
would
have
felt
how
improper
it
was
to
behave
in
that
way
at
least
it
was
praiseworthy
ambition
for
him
to
desire
to
be
as
accomplished
as
linton
and
probably
he
did
not
learn
merely
to
show
off
you
had
made
him
ashamed
of
his
ignorance
before
i
have
no
doubt
and
he
wished
to
remedy
it
and
please
you
to
sneer
at
his
imperfect
attempt
was
very
bad
breeding
had
you
been
brought
up
in
his
circumstances
would
you
be
less
rude
he
was
as
quick
and
as
intelligent
a
child
as
ever
you
were
and
i
hurt
that
he
should
be
despised
now
because
that
base
heathcliff
has
treated
him
so
unjustly
ellen
you
wo
cry
about
it
will
you
she
exclaimed
surprised
at
my
earnestness
wait
and
you
shall
hear
if
he
conned
his
a
b
c
to
please
me
and
if
it
were
worth
while
being
civil
to
the
brute
i
entered
linton
was
lying
on
the
settle
and
half
got
up
to
welcome
me
i
ill
catherine
love
he
said
and
you
must
have
all
the
talk
and
let
me
listen
come
and
sit
by
me
i
was
sure
you
break
your
word
and
i
make
you
promise
again
before
you
go
knew
now
that
i
must
tease
him
as
he
was
ill
and
i
spoke
softly
and
put
no
questions
and
avoided
irritating
him
in
any
way
i
had
brought
some
of
my
nicest
books
for
him
he
asked
me
to
read
a
little
of
one
and
i
was
about
to
comply
when
earnshaw
burst
the
door
open
having
gathered
venom
with
reflection
he
advanced
direct
to
us
seized
linton
by
the
arm
and
swung
him
off
the
seat
get
to
thy
own
room
he
said
in
a
voice
almost
inarticulate
with
passion
and
his
face
looked
swelled
and
furious
take
her
there
if
she
comes
to
see
thee
thou
shall
keep
me
out
of
this
begone
wi
ye
both
swore
at
us
and
left
linton
no
time
to
answer
nearly
throwing
him
into
the
kitchen
and
he
clenched
his
fist
as
i
followed
seemingly
longing
to
knock
me
down
i
was
afraid
for
a
moment
and
i
let
one
volume
fall
he
kicked
it
after
me
and
shut
us
out
i
heard
a
malignant
crackly
laugh
by
the
fire
and
turning
beheld
that
odious
joseph
standing
rubbing
his
bony
hands
and
quivering
i
wer
sure
he
sarve

a
grand
lad

where

i
asked
of
my
cousin
disregarding
the
old
mockery
was
white
and
trembling
he
was
not
pretty
then
ellen
oh
no
he
looked
frightful
for
his
thin
face
and
large
eyes
were
wrought
into
an
expression
of
frantic
powerless
fury
he
grasped
the
handle
of
the
door
and
shook
it
it
was
fastened
inside
if
you
do
let
me
in
i
kill
you
if
you
do
let
me
in
kill
you
he
rather
shrieked
than
said
devil
devil
i
kill

i
kill

joseph
uttered
his
croaking
laugh
again
thear
that
t
father
he
cried
that

allas
summut
o
either
side
in
us
niver

hareton
lad
dunnut
be
he
can
not
get
at
thee
took
hold
of
linton
hands
and
tried
to
pull
him
away
but
he
shrieked
so
shockingly
that
i
dared
not
proceed
at
last
his
cries
were
choked
by
a
dreadful
fit
of
coughing
blood
gushed
from
his
mouth
and
he
fell
on
the
ground
i
ran
into
the
yard
sick
with
terror
and
called
for
zillah
as
loud
as
i
could
she
soon
heard
me
she
was
milking
the
cows
in
a
shed
behind
the
barn
and
hurrying
from
her
work
she
inquired
what
there
was
to
do
i
had
breath
to
explain
dragging
her
in
i
looked
about
for
linton
earnshaw
had
come
out
to
examine
the
mischief
he
had
caused
and
he
was
then
conveying
the
poor
thing
zillah
and
i
ascended
after
him
but
he
stopped
me
at
the
top
of
the
steps
and
said
i
should
go
in
i
must
go
home
i
exclaimed
that
he
had
killed
linton
and
i
enter
joseph
locked
the
door
and
declared
i
should
do
no
sich
stuff
and
asked
me
whether
i
were
bahn
to
be
as
mad
as
him
i
stood
crying
till
the
housekeeper
reappeared
she
affirmed
he
would
be
better
in
a
bit
but
he
could
do
with
that
shrieking
and
din
and
she
took
me
and
nearly
carried
me
into
the
house
i
was
ready
to
tear
my
hair
off
my
head
i
sobbed
and
wept
so
that
my
eyes
were
almost
blind
and
the
ruffian
you
have
such
sympathy
with
stood
opposite
presuming
every
now
and
then
to
bid
me
wisht
and
denying
that
it
was
his
fault
and
finally
frightened
by
my
assertions
that
i
would
tell
papa
and
that
he
should
be
put
in
prison
and
hanged
he
commenced
blubbering
himself
and
hurried
out
to
hide
his
cowardly
agitation
still
i
was
not
rid
of
him
when
at
length
they
compelled
me
to
depart
and
i
had
got
some
hundred
yards
off
the
premises
he
suddenly
issued
from
the
shadow
of
the
and
checked
minny
and
took
hold
of
me
miss
catherine
i
ill
grieved
he
began
but
it
rayther
too
bad
gave
him
a
cut
with
my
whip
thinking
perhaps
he
would
murder
me
he
let
go
thundering
one
of
his
horrid
curses
and
i
galloped
home
more
than
half
out
of
my
senses
did
bid
you
that
evening
and
i
did
go
to
wuthering
heights
the
next
i
wished
to
go
exceedingly
but
i
was
strangely
excited
and
dreaded
to
hear
that
linton
was
dead
sometimes
and
sometimes
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
encountering
hareton
on
the
third
day
i
took
courage
at
least
i
could
bear
longer
suspense
and
stole
off
once
more
i
went
at
five
and
walked
fancying
i
might
manage
to
creep
into
the
house
and
up
to
linton
room
unobserved
however
the
dogs
gave
notice
of
my
approach
zillah
received
me
and
saying
the
lad
was
mending
nicely
showed
me
into
a
small
tidy
carpeted
apartment
where
to
my
inexpressible
joy
i
beheld
linton
laid
on
a
little
sofa
reading
one
of
my
books
but
he
would
neither
speak
to
me
nor
look
at
me
through
a
whole
hour
ellen
he
has
such
an
unhappy
temper
and
what
quite
confounded
me
when
he
did
open
his
mouth
it
was
to
utter
the
falsehood
that
i
had
occasioned
the
uproar
and
hareton
was
not
to
blame
unable
to
reply
except
passionately
i
got
up
and
walked
from
the
room
he
sent
after
me
a
faint
catherine
he
did
not
reckon
on
being
answered
so
but
i
would
turn
back
and
the
morrow
was
the
second
day
on
which
i
stayed
at
home
nearly
determined
to
visit
him
no
more
but
it
was
so
miserable
going
to
bed
and
getting
up
and
never
hearing
anything
about
him
that
my
resolution
melted
into
air
before
it
was
properly
formed
it
had
appeared
wrong
to
take
the
journey
once
now
it
seemed
wrong
to
refrain
michael
came
to
ask
if
he
must
saddle
minny
i
said
yes
and
considered
myself
doing
a
duty
as
she
bore
me
over
the
hills
i
was
forced
to
pass
the
front
windows
to
get
to
the
court
it
was
no
use
trying
to
conceal
my
presence
young
master
is
in
the
house
said
zillah
as
she
saw
me
making
for
the
parlour
i
went
in
earnshaw
was
there
also
but
he
quitted
the
room
directly
linton
sat
in
the
great
half
asleep
walking
up
to
the
fire
i
began
in
a
serious
tone
partly
meaning
it
to
be
true
as
you
do
like
me
linton
and
as
you
think
i
come
on
purpose
to
hurt
you
and
pretend
that
i
do
so
every
time
this
is
our
last
meeting
let
us
say
and
tell
heathcliff
that
you
have
no
wish
to
see
me
and
that
he
must
invent
any
more
falsehoods
on
the
subject
sit
down
and
take
your
hat
off
catherine
he
answered
you
are
so
much
happier
than
i
am
you
ought
to
be
better
papa
talks
enough
of
my
defects
and
shows
enough
scorn
of
me
to
make
it
natural
i
should
doubt
myself
i
doubt
whether
i
am
not
altogether
as
worthless
as
he
calls
me
frequently
and
then
i
feel
so
cross
and
bitter
i
hate
everybody
i
am
worthless
and
bad
in
temper
and
bad
in
spirit
almost
always
and
if
you
choose
you
may
say
you
get
rid
of
an
annoyance
only
catherine
do
me
this
justice
believe
that
if
i
might
be
as
sweet
and
as
kind
and
as
good
as
you
are
i
would
be
as
willingly
and
more
so
than
as
happy
and
as
healthy
and
believe
that
your
kindness
has
made
me
love
you
deeper
than
if
i
deserved
your
love
and
though
i
could
and
can
not
help
showing
my
nature
to
you
i
regret
it
and
repent
it
and
shall
regret
and
repent
it
till
i
die
felt
he
spoke
the
truth
and
i
felt
i
must
forgive
him
and
though
we
should
quarrel
the
next
moment
i
must
forgive
him
again
we
were
reconciled
but
we
cried
both
of
us
the
whole
time
i
stayed
not
entirely
for
sorrow
yet
i
sorry
linton
had
that
distorted
nature
he
never
let
his
friends
be
at
ease
and
he
never
be
at
ease
himself
i
have
always
gone
to
his
little
parlour
since
that
night
because
his
father
returned
the
day
after
three
times
i
think
we
have
been
merry
and
hopeful
as
we
were
the
first
evening
the
rest
of
my
visits
were
dreary
and
troubled
now
with
his
selfishness
and
spite
and
now
with
his
sufferings
but
learned
to
endure
the
former
with
nearly
as
little
resentment
as
the
latter
heathcliff
purposely
avoids
me
i
have
hardly
seen
him
at
all
last
sunday
indeed
coming
earlier
than
usual
i
heard
him
abusing
poor
linton
cruelly
for
his
conduct
of
the
night
before
i
ca
tell
how
he
knew
of
it
unless
he
listened
linton
had
certainly
behaved
provokingly
however
it
was
the
business
of
nobody
but
me
and
i
interrupted
heathcliff
lecture
by
entering
and
telling
him
so
he
burst
into
a
laugh
and
went
away
saying
he
was
glad
i
took
that
view
of
the
matter
since
then
i
told
linton
he
must
whisper
his
bitter
things
now
ellen
you
have
heard
all
i
ca
be
prevented
from
going
to
wuthering
heights
except
by
inflicting
misery
on
two
people
whereas
if
you
only
not
tell
papa
my
going
need
disturb
the
tranquillity
of
none
you
not
tell
will
you
it
will
be
very
heartless
if
you
do
make
up
my
mind
on
that
point
by
miss
catherine
i
replied
requires
some
study
and
so
i
leave
you
to
your
rest
and
go
think
it
over
i
thought
it
over
aloud
in
my
master
presence
walking
straight
from
her
room
to
his
and
relating
the
whole
story
with
the
exception
of
her
conversations
with
her
cousin
and
any
mention
of
hareton
linton
was
alarmed
and
distressed
more
than
he
would
acknowledge
to
me
in
the
morning
catherine
learnt
my
betrayal
of
her
confidence
and
she
learnt
also
that
her
secret
visits
were
to
end
in
vain
she
wept
and
writhed
against
the
interdict
and
implored
her
father
to
have
pity
on
linton
all
she
got
to
comfort
her
was
a
promise
that
he
would
write
and
give
him
leave
to
come
to
the
grange
when
he
pleased
but
explaining
that
he
must
no
longer
expect
to
see
catherine
at
wuthering
heights
perhaps
had
he
been
aware
of
his
nephew
disposition
and
state
of
health
he
would
have
seen
fit
to
withhold
even
that
slight
consolation
chapter
xxv
things
happened
last
winter
sir
said
dean
more
than
a
year
ago
last
winter
i
did
not
think
at
another
twelve
end
i
should
be
amusing
a
stranger
to
the
family
with
relating
them
yet
who
knows
how
long
you
be
a
stranger
you
too
young
to
rest
always
contented
living
by
yourself
and
i
some
way
fancy
no
one
could
see
catherine
linton
and
not
love
her
you
smile
but
why
do
you
look
so
lively
and
interested
when
i
talk
about
her
and
why
have
you
asked
me
to
hang
her
picture
over
your
fireplace
and
why
my
good
friend
i
cried
may
be
very
possible
that
should
love
her
but
would
she
love
me
i
doubt
it
too
much
to
venture
my
tranquillity
by
running
into
temptation
and
then
my
home
is
not
here
i
of
the
busy
world
and
to
its
arms
i
must
return
go
on
was
catherine
obedient
to
her
father
commands
was
continued
the
housekeeper
affection
for
him
was
still
the
chief
sentiment
in
her
heart
and
he
spoke
without
anger
he
spoke
in
the
deep
tenderness
of
one
about
to
leave
his
treasure
amid
perils
and
foes
where
his
remembered
words
would
be
the
only
aid
that
he
could
bequeath
to
guide
her
he
said
to
me
a
few
days
afterwards
i
wish
my
nephew
would
write
ellen
or
call
tell
me
sincerely
what
you
think
of
him
is
he
changed
for
the
better
or
is
there
a
prospect
of
improvement
as
he
grows
a
man
he
very
delicate
sir
i
replied
and
scarcely
likely
to
reach
manhood
but
this
i
can
say
he
does
not
resemble
his
father
and
if
miss
catherine
had
the
misfortune
to
marry
him
he
would
not
be
beyond
her
control
unless
she
were
extremely
and
foolishly
indulgent
however
master
you
have
plenty
of
time
to
get
acquainted
with
him
and
see
whether
he
would
suit
her
it
wants
four
years
and
more
to
his
being
of
age
edgar
sighed
and
walking
to
the
window
looked
out
towards
gimmerton
kirk
it
was
a
misty
afternoon
but
the
february
sun
shone
dimly
and
we
could
just
distinguish
the
two
in
the
yard
and
the
gravestones
prayed
often
he
half
soliloquised
the
approach
of
what
is
coming
and
now
i
begin
to
shrink
and
fear
it
i
thought
the
memory
of
the
hour
i
came
down
that
glen
a
bridegroom
would
be
less
sweet
than
the
anticipation
that
i
was
soon
in
a
few
months
or
possibly
weeks
to
be
carried
up
and
laid
in
its
lonely
hollow
ellen
i
been
very
happy
with
my
little
cathy
through
winter
nights
and
summer
days
she
was
a
living
hope
at
my
side
but
i
been
as
happy
musing
by
myself
among
those
stones
under
that
old
church
lying
through
the
long
june
evenings
on
the
green
mound
of
her
mother
grave
and
wishing
yearning
for
the
time
when
i
might
lie
beneath
it
what
can
i
do
for
cathy
how
must
i
quit
her
i
not
care
one
moment
for
linton
being
son
nor
for
his
taking
her
from
me
if
he
could
console
her
for
my
loss
i
not
care
that

gained
his
ends
and
triumphed
in
robbing
me
of
my
last
blessing
but
should
linton
be
unworthy
only
a
feeble
tool
to
his
father
i
can
not
abandon
her
to
him
and
hard
though
it
be
to
crush
her
buoyant
spirit
i
must
persevere
in
making
her
sad
while
i
live
and
leaving
her
solitary
when
i
die
darling
i
rather
resign
her
to
god
and
lay
her
in
the
earth
before
me
her
to
god
as
it
is
sir
i
answered
if
we
should
lose
you
which
may
he
forbid
under
his
providence
i
stand
her
friend
and
counsellor
to
the
last
miss
catherine
is
a
good
girl
i
do
fear
that
she
will
go
wilfully
wrong
and
people
who
do
their
duty
are
always
finally
rewarded
spring
advanced
yet
my
master
gathered
no
real
strength
though
he
resumed
his
walks
in
the
grounds
with
his
daughter
to
her
inexperienced
notions
this
itself
was
a
sign
of
convalescence
and
then
his
cheek
was
often
flushed
and
his
eyes
were
bright
she
felt
sure
of
his
recovering
on
her
seventeenth
birthday
he
did
not
visit
the
churchyard
it
was
raining
and
i
observed
surely
not
go
out
sir
he
answered
i
defer
it
this
year
a
little
longer
he
wrote
again
to
linton
expressing
his
great
desire
to
see
him
and
had
the
invalid
been
presentable
i
no
doubt
his
father
would
have
permitted
him
to
come
as
it
was
being
instructed
he
returned
an
answer
intimating
that
heathcliff
objected
to
his
calling
at
the
grange
but
his
uncle
kind
remembrance
delighted
him
and
he
hoped
to
meet
him
sometimes
in
his
rambles
and
personally
to
petition
that
his
cousin
and
he
might
not
remain
long
so
utterly
divided
that
part
of
his
letter
was
simple
and
probably
his
own
heathcliff
knew
he
could
plead
eloquently
for
catherine
company
then
do
not
ask
he
said
she
may
visit
here
but
am
i
never
to
see
her
because
my
father
forbids
me
to
go
to
her
home
and
you
forbid
her
to
come
to
mine
do
now
and
then
ride
with
her
towards
the
heights
and
let
us
exchange
a
few
words
in
your
presence
we
have
done
nothing
to
deserve
this
separation
and
you
are
not
angry
with
me
you
have
no
reason
to
dislike
me
you
allow
yourself
dear
uncle
send
me
a
kind
note
and
leave
to
join
you
anywhere
you
please
except
at
thrushcross
grange
i
believe
an
interview
would
convince
you
that
my
father
character
is
not
mine
he
affirms
i
am
more
your
nephew
than
his
son
and
though
i
have
faults
which
render
me
unworthy
of
catherine
she
has
excused
them
and
for
her
sake
you
should
also
you
inquire
after
my
health
it
is
better
but
while
i
remain
cut
off
from
all
hope
and
doomed
to
solitude
or
the
society
of
those
who
never
did
and
never
will
like
me
how
can
i
be
cheerful
and
well
edgar
though
he
felt
for
the
boy
could
not
consent
to
grant
his
request
because
he
could
not
accompany
catherine
he
said
in
summer
perhaps
they
might
meet
meantime
he
wished
him
to
continue
writing
at
intervals
and
engaged
to
give
him
what
advice
and
comfort
he
was
able
by
letter
being
well
aware
of
his
hard
position
in
his
family
linton
complied
and
had
he
been
unrestrained
would
probably
have
spoiled
all
by
filling
his
epistles
with
complaints
and
lamentations
but
his
father
kept
a
sharp
watch
over
him
and
of
course
insisted
on
every
line
that
my
master
sent
being
shown
so
instead
of
penning
his
peculiar
personal
sufferings
and
distresses
the
themes
constantly
uppermost
in
his
thoughts
he
harped
on
the
cruel
obligation
of
being
held
asunder
from
his
friend
and
love
and
gently
intimated
that
linton
must
allow
an
interview
soon
or
he
should
fear
he
was
purposely
deceiving
him
with
empty
promises
cathy
was
a
powerful
ally
at
home
and
between
them
they
at
length
persuaded
my
master
to
acquiesce
in
their
having
a
ride
or
a
walk
together
about
once
a
week
under
my
guardianship
and
on
the
moors
nearest
the
grange
for
june
found
him
still
declining
though
he
had
set
aside
yearly
a
portion
of
his
income
for
my
young
lady
fortune
he
had
a
natural
desire
that
she
might
retain
or
at
least
return
in
a
short
time
to
the
house
of
her
ancestors
and
he
considered
her
only
prospect
of
doing
that
was
by
a
union
with
his
heir
he
had
no
idea
that
the
latter
was
failing
almost
as
fast
as
himself
nor
had
any
one
i
believe
no
doctor
visited
the
heights
and
no
one
saw
master
heathcliff
to
make
report
of
his
condition
among
us
i
for
my
part
began
to
fancy
my
forebodings
were
false
and
that
he
must
be
actually
rallying
when
he
mentioned
riding
and
walking
on
the
moors
and
seemed
so
earnest
in
pursuing
his
object
i
could
not
picture
a
father
treating
a
dying
child
as
tyrannically
and
wickedly
as
i
afterwards
learned
heathcliff
had
treated
him
to
compel
this
apparent
eagerness
his
efforts
redoubling
the
more
imminently
his
avaricious
and
unfeeling
plans
were
threatened
with
defeat
by
death
chapter
xxvi
summer
was
already
past
its
prime
when
edgar
reluctantly
yielded
his
assent
to
their
entreaties
and
catherine
and
i
set
out
on
our
first
ride
to
join
her
cousin
it
was
a
close
sultry
day
devoid
of
sunshine
but
with
a
sky
too
dappled
and
hazy
to
threaten
rain
and
our
place
of
meeting
had
been
fixed
at
the
by
the
on
arriving
there
however
a
little
despatched
as
a
messenger
told
us
that
linton
wer
just
o
this
side
th
heights
and
he
be
mitch
obleeged
to
us
to
gang
on
a
bit
further
master
linton
has
forgot
the
first
injunction
of
his
uncle
i
observed
bid
us
keep
on
the
grange
land
and
here
we
are
off
at
once
we
turn
our
horses
heads
round
when
we
reach
him
answered
my
companion
excursion
shall
lie
towards
home
but
when
we
reached
him
and
that
was
scarcely
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
his
own
door
we
found
he
had
no
horse
and
we
were
forced
to
dismount
and
leave
ours
to
graze
he
lay
on
the
heath
awaiting
our
approach
and
did
not
rise
till
we
came
within
a
few
yards
then
he
walked
so
feebly
and
looked
so
pale
that
i
immediately
exclaimed
master
heathcliff
you
are
not
fit
for
enjoying
a
ramble
this
morning
how
ill
you
do
look
catherine
surveyed
him
with
grief
and
astonishment
she
changed
the
ejaculation
of
joy
on
her
lips
to
one
of
alarm
and
the
congratulation
on
their
meeting
to
an
anxious
inquiry
whether
he
were
worse
than
usual
better
better
he
panted
trembling
and
retaining
her
hand
as
if
he
needed
its
support
while
his
large
blue
eyes
wandered
timidly
over
her
the
hollowness
round
them
transforming
to
haggard
wildness
the
languid
expression
they
once
possessed
you
have
been
worse
persisted
his
cousin
than
when
i
saw
you
last
you
are
thinner
and
tired
he
interrupted
hurriedly
is
too
hot
for
walking
let
us
rest
here
and
in
the
morning
i
often
feel
sick
papa
says
i
grow
so
fast
badly
satisfied
cathy
sat
down
and
he
reclined
beside
her
is
something
like
your
paradise
said
she
making
an
effort
at
cheerfulness
recollect
the
two
days
we
agreed
to
spend
in
the
place
and
way
each
thought
pleasantest
this
is
nearly
yours
only
there
are
clouds
but
then
they
are
so
soft
and
mellow
it
is
nicer
than
sunshine
next
week
if
you
can
we
ride
down
to
the
grange
park
and
try
mine
linton
did
not
appear
to
remember
what
she
talked
of
and
he
had
evidently
great
difficulty
in
sustaining
any
kind
of
conversation
his
lack
of
interest
in
the
subjects
she
started
and
his
equal
incapacity
to
contribute
to
her
entertainment
were
so
obvious
that
she
could
not
conceal
her
disappointment
an
indefinite
alteration
had
come
over
his
whole
person
and
manner
the
pettishness
that
might
be
caressed
into
fondness
had
yielded
to
a
listless
apathy
there
was
less
of
the
peevish
temper
of
a
child
which
frets
and
teases
on
purpose
to
be
soothed
and
more
of
the
moroseness
of
a
confirmed
invalid
repelling
consolation
and
ready
to
regard
the
mirth
of
others
as
an
insult
catherine
perceived
as
well
as
i
did
that
he
held
it
rather
a
punishment
than
a
gratification
to
endure
our
company
and
she
made
no
scruple
of
proposing
presently
to
depart
that
proposal
unexpectedly
roused
linton
from
his
lethargy
and
threw
him
into
a
strange
state
of
agitation
he
glanced
fearfully
towards
the
heights
begging
she
would
remain
another
at
least
i
think
said
cathy
be
more
comfortable
at
home
than
sitting
here
and
i
can
not
amuse
you
i
see
by
my
tales
and
songs
and
chatter
you
have
grown
wiser
than
i
in
these
six
months
you
have
little
taste
for
my
diversions
now
or
else
if
i
could
amuse
you
i
willingly
stay
to
rest
yourself
he
replied
catherine
do
think
or
say
that
i
unwell
it
is
the
heavy
weather
and
heat
that
make
me
dull
and
i
walked
about
before
you
came
a
great
deal
for
me
tell
uncle
i
in
tolerable
health
will
you
tell
him
that
say
so
linton
i
could
affirm
that
you
are
observed
my
young
lady
wondering
at
his
pertinacious
assertion
of
what
was
evidently
an
untruth
be
here
again
next
thursday
continued
he
shunning
her
puzzled
gaze
give
him
my
thanks
for
permitting
you
to
come
my
best
thanks
catherine
and
and
if
you
meet
my
father
and
he
asked
you
about
me
do
lead
him
to
suppose
that
i
been
extremely
silent
and
stupid
do
look
sad
and
downcast
as
you
are
doing
he
be
angry
care
nothing
for
his
anger
exclaimed
cathy
imagining
she
would
be
its
object
i
do
said
her
cousin
shuddering
provoke
him
against
me
catherine
for
he
is
very
hard
he
severe
to
you
master
heathcliff
i
inquired
he
grown
weary
of
indulgence
and
passed
from
passive
to
active
hatred
linton
looked
at
me
but
did
not
answer
and
after
keeping
her
seat
by
his
side
another
ten
minutes
during
which
his
head
fell
drowsily
on
his
breast
and
he
uttered
nothing
except
suppressed
moans
of
exhaustion
or
pain
cathy
began
to
seek
solace
in
looking
for
bilberries
and
sharing
the
produce
of
her
researches
with
me
she
did
not
offer
them
to
him
for
she
saw
further
notice
would
only
weary
and
annoy
it
now
ellen
she
whispered
in
my
ear
at
last
ca
tell
why
we
should
stay
he
asleep
and
papa
will
be
wanting
us
back
we
must
not
leave
him
asleep
i
answered
till
he
wakes
and
be
patient
you
were
mighty
eager
to
set
off
but
your
longing
to
see
poor
linton
has
soon
evaporated
did
wish
to
see
me
returned
catherine
his
crossest
humours
formerly
i
liked
him
better
than
i
do
in
his
present
curious
mood
it
just
as
if
it
were
a
task
he
was
compelled
to
perform
this
interview
for
fear
his
father
should
scold
him
but
i
hardly
going
to
come
to
give
heathcliff
pleasure
whatever
reason
he
may
have
for
ordering
linton
to
undergo
this
penance
and
though
i
glad
better
in
health
i
sorry
he
so
much
less
pleasant
and
so
much
less
affectionate
to
me
think
better
in
health
then
i
said
she
answered
he
always
made
such
a
great
deal
of
his
sufferings
you
know
he
is
not
tolerably
well
as
he
told
me
to
tell
papa
but
he
better
very
likely
you
differ
with
me
miss
cathy
i
remarked
should
conjecture
him
to
be
far
worse
linton
here
started
from
his
slumber
in
bewildered
terror
and
asked
if
any
one
had
called
his
name
said
catherine
in
dreams
i
can
not
conceive
how
you
manage
to
doze
out
of
doors
in
the
morning
thought
i
heard
my
father
he
gasped
glancing
up
to
the
frowning
nab
above
us
are
sure
nobody
spoke
sure
replied
his
cousin
ellen
and
i
were
disputing
concerning
your
health
are
you
truly
stronger
linton
than
when
we
separated
in
winter
if
you
be
i
certain
one
thing
is
not
stronger
your
regard
for
me
speak
are
you
the
tears
gushed
from
linton
eyes
as
he
answered
yes
i
am
and
still
under
the
spell
of
the
imaginary
voice
his
gaze
wandered
up
and
down
to
detect
its
owner
cathy
rose
we
must
part
she
said
i
wo
conceal
that
i
have
been
sadly
disappointed
with
our
meeting
though
i
mention
it
to
nobody
but
you
not
that
i
stand
in
awe
of
mr
heathcliff
murmured
linton
god
sake
hush
he
coming
and
he
clung
to
catherine
arm
striving
to
detain
her
but
at
that
announcement
she
hastily
disengaged
herself
and
whistled
to
minny
who
obeyed
her
like
a
dog
be
here
next
thursday
she
cried
springing
to
the
saddle
quick
ellen
and
so
we
left
him
scarcely
conscious
of
our
departure
so
absorbed
was
he
in
anticipating
his
father
approach
before
we
reached
home
catherine
displeasure
softened
into
a
perplexed
sensation
of
pity
and
regret
largely
blended
with
vague
uneasy
doubts
about
linton
actual
circumstances
physical
and
social
in
which
i
partook
though
i
counselled
her
not
to
say
much
for
a
second
journey
would
make
us
better
judges
my
master
requested
an
account
of
our
ongoings
his
nephew
offering
of
thanks
was
duly
delivered
miss
cathy
gently
touching
on
the
rest
i
also
threw
little
light
on
his
inquiries
for
i
hardly
knew
what
to
hide
and
what
to
reveal
chapter
xxvii
seven
days
glided
away
every
one
marking
its
course
by
the
henceforth
rapid
alteration
of
edgar
linton
state
the
havoc
that
months
had
previously
wrought
was
now
emulated
by
the
inroads
of
hours
catherine
we
would
fain
have
deluded
yet
but
her
own
quick
spirit
refused
to
delude
her
it
divined
in
secret
and
brooded
on
the
dreadful
probability
gradually
ripening
into
certainty
she
had
not
the
heart
to
mention
her
ride
when
thursday
came
round
i
mentioned
it
for
her
and
obtained
permission
to
order
her
out
of
doors
for
the
library
where
her
father
stopped
a
short
time
daily
the
brief
period
he
could
bear
to
sit
up
and
his
chamber
had
become
her
whole
world
she
grudged
each
moment
that
did
not
find
her
bending
over
his
pillow
or
seated
by
his
side
her
countenance
grew
wan
with
watching
and
sorrow
and
my
master
gladly
dismissed
her
to
what
he
flattered
himself
would
be
a
happy
change
of
scene
and
society
drawing
comfort
from
the
hope
that
she
would
not
now
be
left
entirely
alone
after
his
death
he
had
a
fixed
idea
i
guessed
by
several
observations
he
let
fall
that
as
his
nephew
resembled
him
in
person
he
would
resemble
him
in
mind
for
linton
letters
bore
few
or
no
indications
of
his
defective
character
and
i
through
pardonable
weakness
refrained
from
correcting
the
error
asking
myself
what
good
there
would
be
in
disturbing
his
last
moments
with
information
that
he
had
neither
power
nor
opportunity
to
turn
to
account
we
deferred
our
excursion
till
the
afternoon
a
golden
afternoon
of
august
every
breath
from
the
hills
so
full
of
life
that
it
seemed
whoever
respired
it
though
dying
might
revive
catherine
face
was
just
like
the
landscape
shadows
and
sunshine
flitting
over
it
in
rapid
succession
but
the
shadows
rested
longer
and
the
sunshine
was
more
transient
and
her
poor
little
heart
reproached
itself
for
even
that
passing
forgetfulness
of
its
cares
we
discerned
linton
watching
at
the
same
spot
he
had
selected
before
my
young
mistress
alighted
and
told
me
that
as
she
was
resolved
to
stay
a
very
little
while
i
had
better
hold
the
pony
and
remain
on
horseback
but
i
dissented
i
would
risk
losing
sight
of
the
charge
committed
to
me
a
minute
so
we
climbed
the
slope
of
heath
together
master
heathcliff
received
us
with
greater
animation
on
this
occasion
not
the
animation
of
high
spirits
though
nor
yet
of
joy
it
looked
more
like
fear
is
late
he
said
speaking
short
and
with
difficulty
not
your
father
very
ill
i
thought
you
would
come
wo
you
be
candid
cried
catherine
swallowing
her
greeting
can
not
you
say
at
once
you
do
want
me
it
is
strange
linton
that
for
the
second
time
you
have
brought
me
here
on
purpose
apparently
to
distress
us
both
and
for
no
reason
besides
linton
shivered
and
glanced
at
her
half
supplicating
half
ashamed
but
his
cousin
patience
was
not
sufficient
to
endure
this
enigmatical
behaviour
father
very
ill
she
said
why
am
i
called
from
his
bedside
why
did
you
send
to
absolve
me
from
my
promise
when
you
wished
i
would
keep
it
come
i
desire
an
explanation
playing
and
trifling
are
completely
banished
out
of
my
mind
and
i
ca
dance
attendance
on
your
affectations
now
affectations
he
murmured
are
they
for
heaven
sake
catherine
do
look
so
angry
despise
me
as
much
as
you
please
i
am
a
worthless
cowardly
wretch
i
ca
be
scorned
enough
but
i
too
mean
for
your
anger
hate
my
father
and
spare
me
for
contempt
cried
catherine
in
a
passion
silly
boy
and
there
he
trembles
as
if
i
were
really
going
to
touch
him
you
bespeak
contempt
linton
anybody
will
have
it
spontaneously
at
your
service
get
off
i
shall
return
home
it
is
folly
dragging
you
from
the
and
pretending
what
do
we
pretend
let
go
my
frock
if
i
pitied
you
for
crying
and
looking
so
very
frightened
you
should
spurn
such
pity
ellen
tell
him
how
disgraceful
this
conduct
is
rise
and
do
degrade
yourself
into
an
abject
reptile
with
streaming
face
and
an
expression
of
agony
linton
had
thrown
his
nerveless
frame
along
the
ground
he
seemed
convulsed
with
exquisite
terror
he
sobbed
can
not
bear
it
catherine
catherine
i
a
traitor
too
and
i
dare
not
tell
you
but
leave
me
and
i
shall
be
killed
catherine
my
life
is
in
your
hands
and
you
have
said
you
loved
me
and
if
you
did
it
would
harm
you
you
not
go
then
kind
sweet
good
catherine
and
perhaps
you
consent
and
he
let
me
die
with
you
my
young
lady
on
witnessing
his
intense
anguish
stooped
to
raise
him
the
old
feeling
of
indulgent
tenderness
overcame
her
vexation
and
she
grew
thoroughly
moved
and
alarmed
to
what
she
asked
stay
tell
me
the
meaning
of
this
strange
talk
and
i
will
you
contradict
your
own
words
and
distract
me
be
calm
and
frank
and
confess
at
once
all
that
weighs
on
your
heart
you
would
injure
me
linton
would
you
you
would
let
any
enemy
hurt
me
if
you
could
prevent
it
i
believe
you
are
a
coward
for
yourself
but
not
a
cowardly
betrayer
of
your
best
friend
my
father
threatened
me
gasped
the
boy
clasping
his
attenuated
fingers
i
dread
him
i
dread
him
i
not
tell
well
said
catherine
with
scornful
compassion
your
secret
no
coward
save
yourself
i
not
afraid
her
magnanimity
provoked
his
tears
he
wept
wildly
kissing
her
supporting
hands
and
yet
could
not
summon
courage
to
speak
out
i
was
cogitating
what
the
mystery
might
be
and
determined
catherine
should
never
suffer
to
benefit
him
or
any
one
else
by
my
good
will
when
hearing
a
rustle
among
the
ling
i
looked
up
and
saw
heathcliff
almost
close
upon
us
descending
the
heights
he
did
cast
a
glance
towards
my
companions
though
they
were
sufficiently
near
for
sobs
to
be
audible
but
hailing
me
in
the
almost
hearty
tone
he
assumed
to
none
besides
and
the
sincerity
of
which
i
could
avoid
doubting
he
said
is
something
to
see
you
so
near
to
my
house
nelly
how
are
you
at
the
grange
let
us
hear
the
rumour
goes
he
added
in
a
lower
tone
edgar
linton
is
on
his
perhaps
they
exaggerate
his
illness
my
master
is
dying
i
replied
is
true
enough
a
sad
thing
it
will
be
for
us
all
but
a
blessing
for
him
long
will
he
last
do
you
think
he
asked
do
know
i
said
he
continued
looking
at
the
two
young
people
who
were
fixed
under
his
eye
linton
appeared
as
if
he
could
not
venture
to
stir
or
raise
his
head
and
catherine
could
not
move
on
his
account
that
lad
yonder
seems
determined
to
beat
me
and
i
thank
his
uncle
to
be
quick
and
go
before
him
hallo
has
the
whelp
been
playing
that
game
long
i
give
him
some
lessons
about
snivelling
is
he
pretty
lively
with
miss
linton
generally
no
he
has
shown
the
greatest
distress
i
answered
see
him
i
should
say
that
instead
of
rambling
with
his
sweetheart
on
the
hills
he
ought
to
be
in
bed
under
the
hands
of
a
doctor
shall
be
in
a
day
or
two
muttered
heathcliff
first
get
up
linton
get
up
he
shouted
grovel
on
the
ground
there
up
this
moment
linton
had
sunk
prostrate
again
in
another
paroxysm
of
helpless
fear
caused
by
his
father
glance
towards
him
i
suppose
there
was
nothing
else
to
produce
such
humiliation
he
made
several
efforts
to
obey
but
his
little
strength
was
annihilated
for
the
time
and
he
fell
back
again
with
a
moan
heathcliff
advanced
and
lifted
him
to
lean
against
a
ridge
of
turf
said
he
with
curbed
ferocity
getting
angry
and
if
you
command
that
paltry
spirit
of
yours
you
get
up
directly
will
father
he
panted
let
me
alone
or
i
shall
faint
done
as
you
wished
i
sure
catherine
will
tell
you
that
i
that
i
have
been
cheerful
ah
keep
by
me
catherine
give
me
your
hand
mine
said
his
father
on
your
feet
there
now
lend
you
her
arm
that
right
look
at
her
you
would
imagine
i
was
the
devil
himself
miss
linton
to
excite
such
horror
be
so
kind
as
to
walk
home
with
him
will
you
he
shudders
if
i
touch
him
dear
whispered
catherine
ca
go
to
wuthering
heights
papa
has
forbidden
me
he
not
harm
you
why
are
you
so
afraid
can
never
that
house
he
answered
to
it
without
you
cried
his
father
respect
catherine
filial
scruples
nelly
take
him
in
and
i
follow
your
advice
concerning
the
doctor
without
delay
do
well
replied
i
i
must
remain
with
my
mistress
to
mind
your
son
is
not
my
business
are
very
stiff
said
heathcliff
know
that
but
you
force
me
to
pinch
the
baby
and
make
it
scream
before
it
moves
your
charity
come
then
my
hero
are
you
willing
to
return
escorted
by
me
he
approached
once
more
and
made
as
if
he
would
seize
the
fragile
being
but
shrinking
back
linton
clung
to
his
cousin
and
implored
her
to
accompany
him
with
a
frantic
importunity
that
admitted
no
denial
however
i
disapproved
i
could
hinder
her
indeed
how
could
she
have
refused
him
herself
what
was
filling
him
with
dread
we
had
no
means
of
discerning
but
there
he
was
powerless
under
its
grip
and
any
addition
seemed
capable
of
shocking
him
into
idiotcy
we
reached
the
threshold
catherine
walked
in
and
i
stood
waiting
till
she
had
conducted
the
invalid
to
a
chair
expecting
her
out
immediately
when
heathcliff
pushing
me
forward
exclaimed
house
is
not
stricken
with
the
plague
nelly
and
i
have
a
mind
to
be
hospitable
sit
down
and
allow
me
to
shut
the
door
he
shut
and
locked
it
also
i
started
shall
have
tea
before
you
go
home
he
added
am
by
myself
hareton
is
gone
with
some
cattle
to
the
lees
and
zillah
and
joseph
are
off
on
a
journey
of
pleasure
and
though
i
used
to
being
alone
rather
have
some
interesting
company
if
i
can
get
it
miss
linton
take
your
seat
by
i
give
you
what
i
have
the
present
is
hardly
worth
accepting
but
i
have
nothing
else
to
offer
it
is
linton
i
mean
how
she
does
stare
it
odd
what
a
savage
feeling
i
have
to
anything
that
seems
afraid
of
me
had
i
been
born
where
laws
are
less
strict
and
tastes
less
dainty
i
should
treat
myself
to
a
slow
vivisection
of
those
two
as
an
evening
amusement
he
drew
in
his
breath
struck
the
table
and
swore
to
himself
hell
i
hate
them
am
not
afraid
of
you
exclaimed
catherine
who
could
not
hear
the
latter
part
of
his
speech
she
stepped
close
up
her
black
eyes
flashing
with
passion
and
resolution
me
that
key
i
will
have
it
she
said
would
eat
or
drink
here
if
i
were
starving
heathcliff
had
the
key
in
his
hand
that
remained
on
the
table
he
looked
up
seized
with
a
sort
of
surprise
at
her
boldness
or
possibly
reminded
by
her
voice
and
glance
of
the
person
from
whom
she
inherited
it
she
snatched
at
the
instrument
and
half
succeeded
in
getting
it
out
of
his
loosened
fingers
but
her
action
recalled
him
to
the
present
he
recovered
it
speedily
catherine
linton
he
said
off
or
i
shall
knock
you
down
and
that
will
make
dean
mad
regardless
of
this
warning
she
captured
his
closed
hand
and
its
contents
again
go
she
repeated
exerting
her
utmost
efforts
to
cause
the
iron
muscles
to
relax
and
finding
that
her
nails
made
no
impression
she
applied
her
teeth
pretty
sharply
heathcliff
glanced
at
me
a
glance
that
kept
me
from
interfering
a
moment
catherine
was
too
intent
on
his
fingers
to
notice
his
face
he
opened
them
suddenly
and
resigned
the
object
of
dispute
but
ere
she
had
well
secured
it
he
seized
her
with
the
liberated
hand
and
pulling
her
on
his
knee
administered
with
the
other
a
shower
of
terrific
slaps
on
both
sides
of
the
head
each
sufficient
to
have
fulfilled
his
threat
had
she
been
able
to
fall
at
this
diabolical
violence
i
rushed
on
him
furiously
villain
i
began
to
cry
villain
a
touch
on
the
chest
silenced
me
i
am
stout
and
soon
put
out
of
breath
and
what
with
that
and
the
rage
i
staggered
dizzily
back
and
felt
ready
to
suffocate
or
to
burst
a
the
scene
was
over
in
two
minutes
catherine
released
put
her
two
hands
to
her
temples
and
looked
just
as
if
she
were
not
sure
whether
her
ears
were
off
or
on
she
trembled
like
a
reed
poor
thing
and
leant
against
the
table
perfectly
bewildered
know
how
to
chastise
children
you
see
said
the
scoundrel
grimly
as
he
stooped
to
repossess
himself
of
the
key
which
had
dropped
to
the
floor
to
linton
now
as
i
told
you
and
cry
at
your
ease
i
shall
be
your
father
all
the
father
you
have
in
a
few
days
and
you
shall
have
plenty
of
that
you
can
bear
plenty
you
no
weakling
you
shall
have
a
daily
taste
if
i
catch
such
a
devil
of
a
temper
in
your
eyes
again
cathy
ran
to
me
instead
of
linton
and
knelt
down
and
put
her
burning
cheek
on
my
lap
weeping
aloud
her
cousin
had
shrunk
into
a
corner
of
the
settle
as
quiet
as
a
mouse
congratulating
himself
i
dare
say
that
the
correction
had
alighted
on
another
than
him
heathcliff
perceiving
us
all
confounded
rose
and
expeditiously
made
the
tea
himself
the
cups
and
saucers
were
laid
ready
he
poured
it
out
and
handed
me
a
cup
away
your
spleen
he
said
help
your
own
naughty
pet
and
mine
it
is
not
poisoned
though
i
prepared
it
i
going
out
to
seek
your
horses
our
first
thought
on
his
departure
was
to
force
an
exit
somewhere
we
tried
the
kitchen
door
but
that
was
fastened
outside
we
looked
at
the
windows
they
were
too
narrow
for
even
cathy
little
figure
linton
i
cried
seeing
we
were
regularly
imprisoned
know
what
your
diabolical
father
is
after
and
you
shall
tell
us
or
i
box
your
ears
as
he
has
done
your
cousin
linton
you
must
tell
said
catherine
was
for
your
sake
i
came
and
it
will
be
wickedly
ungrateful
if
you
refuse
me
some
tea
i
thirsty
and
then
i
tell
you
he
answered
dean
go
away
i
do
like
you
standing
over
me
now
catherine
you
are
letting
your
tears
fall
into
my
cup
i
wo
drink
that
give
me
another
catherine
pushed
another
to
him
and
wiped
her
face
i
felt
disgusted
at
the
little
wretch
composure
since
he
was
no
longer
in
terror
for
himself
the
anguish
he
had
exhibited
on
the
moor
subsided
as
soon
as
ever
he
entered
wuthering
heights
so
i
guessed
he
had
been
menaced
with
an
awful
visitation
of
wrath
if
he
failed
in
decoying
us
there
and
that
accomplished
he
had
no
further
immediate
fears
wants
us
to
be
married
he
continued
after
sipping
some
of
the
liquid
he
knows
your
papa
would
let
us
marry
now
and
afraid
of
my
dying
if
we
wait
so
we
are
to
be
married
in
the
morning
and
you
are
to
stay
here
all
night
and
if
you
do
as
he
wishes
you
shall
return
home
next
day
and
take
me
with
you
you
with
her
pitiful
changeling
i
exclaimed
marry
why
the
man
is
mad
or
he
thinks
us
fools
every
one
and
do
you
imagine
that
beautiful
young
lady
that
healthy
hearty
girl
will
tie
herself
to
a
little
perishing
monkey
like
you
are
you
cherishing
the
notion
that
anybody
let
alone
miss
catherine
linton
would
have
you
for
a
husband
you
want
whipping
for
bringing
us
in
here
at
all
with
your
dastardly
puling
tricks
and
do
look
so
silly
now
i
a
very
good
mind
to
shake
you
severely
for
your
contemptible
treachery
and
your
imbecile
conceit
i
did
give
him
a
slight
shaking
but
it
brought
on
the
cough
and
he
took
to
his
ordinary
resource
of
moaning
and
weeping
and
catherine
rebuked
me
all
night
no
she
said
looking
slowly
round
i
burn
that
door
down
but
i
get
out
and
she
would
have
commenced
the
execution
of
her
threat
directly
but
linton
was
up
in
alarm
for
his
dear
self
again
he
clasped
her
in
his
two
feeble
arms
sobbing
you
have
me
and
save
me
not
let
me
come
to
the
grange
oh
darling
catherine
you
must
go
and
leave
after
all
you
obey
my
father
you
must
obey
my
own
she
replied
relieve
him
from
this
cruel
suspense
the
whole
night
what
would
he
think
he
be
distressed
already
i
either
break
or
burn
a
way
out
of
the
house
be
quiet
you
in
no
danger
but
if
you
hinder
me
linton
i
love
papa
better
than
you
the
mortal
terror
he
felt
of
heathcliff
anger
restored
to
the
boy
his
coward
eloquence
catherine
was
near
distraught
still
she
persisted
that
she
must
go
home
and
tried
entreaty
in
her
turn
persuading
him
to
subdue
his
selfish
agony
while
they
were
thus
occupied
our
jailor
beasts
have
trotted
off
he
said
now
linton
snivelling
again
what
has
she
been
doing
to
you
come
come
have
done
and
get
to
bed
in
a
month
or
two
my
lad
you
be
able
to
pay
her
back
her
present
tyrannies
with
a
vigorous
hand
you
pining
for
pure
love
are
you
not
nothing
else
in
the
world
and
she
shall
have
you
there
to
bed
zillah
wo
be
here
you
must
undress
yourself
hush
hold
your
noise
once
in
your
own
room
i
not
come
near
you
you
need
fear
by
chance
you
managed
tolerably
i
look
to
the
rest
he
spoke
these
words
holding
the
door
open
for
his
son
to
pass
and
the
latter
achieved
his
exit
exactly
as
a
spaniel
might
which
suspected
the
person
who
attended
on
it
of
designing
a
spiteful
squeeze
the
lock
was
heathcliff
approached
the
fire
where
my
mistress
and
i
stood
silent
catherine
looked
up
and
instinctively
raised
her
hand
to
her
cheek
his
neighbourhood
revived
a
painful
sensation
anybody
else
would
have
been
incapable
of
regarding
the
childish
act
with
sternness
but
he
scowled
on
her
and
muttered
you
are
not
afraid
of
me
your
courage
is
well
disguised
you
seem
damnably
afraid
afraid
now
she
replied
if
i
stay
papa
will
be
miserable
and
how
can
i
endure
making
him
miserable
when
he
when
he
heathcliff
let
go
home
i
promise
to
marry
linton
papa
would
like
me
to
and
i
love
him
why
should
you
wish
to
force
me
to
do
what
i
willingly
do
of
myself
him
dare
to
force
you
i
cried
law
in
the
land
thank
god
there
is
though
we
be
in
an
place
i
inform
if
he
were
my
own
son
and
it
felony
without
benefit
of
clergy
said
the
ruffian
the
devil
with
your
clamour
i
want
to
speak
miss
linton
i
shall
enjoy
myself
remarkably
in
thinking
your
father
will
be
miserable
i
shall
not
sleep
for
satisfaction
you
could
have
hit
on
no
surer
way
of
fixing
your
residence
under
my
roof
for
the
next
hours
than
informing
me
that
such
an
event
would
follow
as
to
your
promise
to
marry
linton
i
take
care
you
shall
keep
it
for
you
shall
not
quit
this
place
till
it
is
fulfilled
ellen
then
to
let
papa
know
i
safe
exclaimed
catherine
weeping
bitterly
marry
me
now
poor
papa
ellen
he
think
we
lost
what
shall
we
do
he
he
think
you
are
tired
of
waiting
on
him
and
run
off
for
a
little
amusement
answered
heathcliff
can
not
deny
that
you
entered
my
house
of
your
own
accord
in
contempt
of
his
injunctions
to
the
contrary
and
it
is
quite
natural
that
you
should
desire
amusement
at
your
age
and
that
you
would
weary
of
nursing
a
sick
man
and
that
man
your
father
catherine
his
happiest
days
were
over
when
your
days
began
he
cursed
you
i
dare
say
for
coming
into
the
world
i
did
at
least
and
it
would
just
do
if
he
cursed
you
as
went
out
of
it
i
join
him
i
do
love
you
how
should
i
weep
away
as
far
as
i
can
see
it
will
be
your
chief
diversion
hereafter
unless
linton
make
amends
for
other
losses
and
your
provident
parent
appears
to
fancy
he
may
his
letters
of
advice
and
consolation
entertained
me
vastly
in
his
last
he
recommended
my
jewel
to
be
careful
of
his
and
kind
to
her
when
he
got
her
careful
and
kind
that
paternal
but
linton
requires
his
whole
stock
of
care
and
kindness
for
himself
linton
can
play
the
little
tyrant
well
he
undertake
to
torture
any
number
of
cats
if
their
teeth
be
drawn
and
their
claws
pared
you
be
able
to
tell
his
uncle
fine
tales
of
his
when
you
get
home
again
i
assure
you
right
there
i
said
your
son
character
show
his
resemblance
to
yourself
and
then
i
hope
miss
cathy
will
think
twice
before
she
takes
the
cockatrice
do
much
mind
speaking
of
his
amiable
qualities
now
he
answered
she
must
either
accept
him
or
remain
a
prisoner
and
you
along
with
her
till
your
master
dies
i
can
detain
you
both
quite
concealed
here
if
you
doubt
encourage
her
to
retract
her
word
and
you
have
an
opportunity
of
judging
not
retract
my
word
said
catherine
marry
him
within
this
hour
if
i
may
go
to
thrushcross
grange
afterwards
heathcliff
you
a
cruel
man
but
you
not
a
fiend
and
you
wo
from
malice
destroy
irrevocably
all
my
happiness
if
papa
thought
i
had
left
him
on
purpose
and
if
he
died
before
i
returned
could
i
bear
to
live
i
given
over
crying
but
i
going
to
kneel
here
at
your
knee
and
i
not
get
up
and
i
not
take
my
eyes
from
your
face
till
you
look
back
at
me
no
do
turn
away
you
see
nothing
to
provoke
you
i
do
hate
you
i
not
angry
that
you
struck
me
have
you
never
loved
in
all
your
life
uncle
ah
you
must
look
once
i
so
wretched
you
ca
help
being
sorry
and
pitying
me
your
eft
fingers
off
and
move
or
i
kick
you
cried
heathcliff
brutally
repulsing
her
rather
be
hugged
by
a
snake
how
the
devil
can
you
dream
of
fawning
on
me
i
you
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
shook
himself
indeed
as
if
his
flesh
crept
with
aversion
and
thrust
back
his
chair
while
i
got
up
and
opened
my
mouth
to
commence
a
downright
torrent
of
abuse
but
i
was
rendered
dumb
in
the
middle
of
the
first
sentence
by
a
threat
that
i
should
be
shown
into
a
room
by
myself
the
very
next
syllable
i
uttered
it
was
growing
dark
we
heard
a
sound
of
voices
at
the
our
host
hurried
out
instantly
had
his
wits
about
him
had
not
there
was
a
talk
of
two
or
three
minutes
and
he
returned
alone
thought
it
had
been
your
cousin
hareton
i
observed
to
catherine
wish
he
would
arrive
who
knows
but
he
might
take
our
part
was
three
servants
sent
to
seek
you
from
the
grange
said
heathcliff
overhearing
me
should
have
opened
a
lattice
and
called
out
but
i
could
swear
that
chit
is
glad
you
did
she
glad
to
be
obliged
to
stay
i
certain
at
learning
the
chance
we
had
missed
we
both
gave
vent
to
our
grief
without
control
and
he
allowed
us
to
wail
on
till
nine
then
he
bid
us
go
upstairs
through
the
kitchen
to
zillah
chamber
and
i
whispered
my
companion
to
obey
perhaps
we
might
contrive
to
get
through
the
window
there
or
into
a
garret
and
out
by
its
skylight
the
window
however
was
narrow
like
those
below
and
the
garret
trap
was
safe
from
our
attempts
for
we
were
fastened
in
as
before
we
neither
of
us
lay
down
catherine
took
her
station
by
the
lattice
and
watched
anxiously
for
morning
a
deep
sigh
being
the
only
answer
i
could
obtain
to
my
frequent
entreaties
that
she
would
try
to
rest
i
seated
myself
in
a
chair
and
rocked
to
and
fro
passing
harsh
judgment
on
my
many
derelictions
of
duty
from
which
it
struck
me
then
all
the
misfortunes
of
my
employers
sprang
it
was
not
the
case
in
reality
i
am
aware
but
it
was
in
my
imagination
that
dismal
night
and
i
thought
heathcliff
himself
less
guilty
than
i
at
seven
he
came
and
inquired
if
miss
linton
had
risen
she
ran
to
the
door
immediately
and
answered
then
he
said
opening
it
and
pulling
her
out
i
rose
to
follow
but
he
turned
the
lock
again
i
demanded
my
release
patient
he
replied
send
up
your
breakfast
in
a
while
i
thumped
on
the
panels
and
rattled
the
latch
angrily
and
catherine
asked
why
i
was
still
shut
up
he
answered
i
must
try
to
endure
it
another
hour
and
they
went
away
i
endured
it
two
or
three
hours
at
length
i
heard
a
footstep
not
heathcliff
brought
you
something
to
eat
said
a
voice
t
door
complying
eagerly
i
beheld
hareton
laden
with
food
enough
to
last
me
all
day
it
he
added
thrusting
the
tray
into
my
hand
one
minute
i
began
cried
he
and
retired
regardless
of
any
prayers
i
could
pour
forth
to
detain
him
and
there
i
remained
enclosed
the
whole
day
and
the
whole
of
the
next
night
and
another
and
another
five
nights
and
four
days
i
remained
altogether
seeing
nobody
but
hareton
once
every
morning
and
he
was
a
model
of
a
jailor
surly
and
dumb
and
deaf
to
every
attempt
at
moving
his
sense
of
justice
or
compassion
chapter
xxviii
on
the
fifth
morning
or
rather
afternoon
a
different
step
approached
lighter
and
shorter
and
this
time
the
person
entered
the
room
it
was
zillah
donned
in
her
scarlet
shawl
with
a
black
silk
bonnet
on
her
head
and
a
swung
to
her
arm
dear
mrs
dean
she
exclaimed
there
is
a
talk
about
you
at
gimmerton
i
never
thought
but
you
were
sunk
in
the
blackhorse
marsh
and
missy
with
you
till
master
told
me
you

found
and
he
lodged
you
here
what
and
you
must
have
got
on
an
island
sure
and
how
long
were
you
in
the
hole
did
master
save
you
dean
but
you
not
so
thin
you
not
been
so
poorly
have
you
master
is
a
true
scoundrel
i
replied
he
shall
answer
for
it
he
need
have
raised
that
tale
it
shall
all
be
laid
bare
do
you
mean
asked
zillah
not
his
tale
they
tell
that
in
the
village
about
your
being
lost
in
the
marsh
and
i
calls
to
earnshaw
when
i
come
in
eh
they
queer
things
hareton
happened
since
i
went
off
it
a
sad
pity
of
that
likely
young
lass
and
cant
nelly
dean
he
stared
i
thought
he
had
not
heard
aught
so
i
told
him
the
rumour
the
master
listened
and
he
just
smiled
to
himself
and
said
if
they
have
been
in
the
marsh
they
are
out
now
zillah
nelly
dean
is
lodged
at
this
minute
in
your
room
you
can
tell
her
to
flit
when
you
go
up
here
is
the
key
the
got
into
her
head
and
she
would
have
run
home
quite
flighty
but
i
fixed
her
till
she
came
round
to
her
senses
you
can
bid
her
go
to
the
grange
at
once
if
she
be
able
and
carry
a
message
from
me
that
her
young
lady
will
follow
in
time
to
attend
the
squire
funeral
edgar
is
not
dead
i
gasped
zillah
zillah
no
sit
you
down
my
good
mistress
she
replied
right
sickly
yet
he
not
dead
doctor
kenneth
thinks
he
may
last
another
day
i
met
him
on
the
road
and
asked
instead
of
sitting
down
i
snatched
my
outdoor
things
and
hastened
below
for
the
way
was
free
on
entering
the
house
i
looked
about
for
some
one
to
give
information
of
catherine
the
place
was
filled
with
sunshine
and
the
door
stood
wide
open
but
nobody
seemed
at
hand
as
i
hesitated
whether
to
go
off
at
once
or
return
and
seek
my
mistress
a
slight
cough
drew
my
attention
to
the
hearth
linton
lay
on
the
settle
sole
tenant
sucking
a
stick
of
and
pursuing
my
movements
with
apathetic
eyes
is
miss
catherine
i
demanded
sternly
supposing
i
could
frighten
him
into
giving
intelligence
by
catching
him
thus
alone
he
sucked
on
like
an
innocent
she
gone
i
said
he
replied
upstairs
she
not
to
go
we
wo
let
her
wo
let
her
little
idiot
i
exclaimed
me
to
her
room
immediately
or
i
make
you
sing
out
sharply
would
make
you
sing
out
if
you
attempted
to
get
there
he
answered
says
i
not
to
be
soft
with
catherine
she
my
wife
and
it
shameful
that
she
should
wish
to
leave
me
he
says
she
hates
me
and
wants
me
to
die
that
she
may
have
my
money
but
she
sha
have
it
and
she
sha
go
home
she
never
shall
she
may
cry
and
be
sick
as
much
as
she
pleases
he
resumed
his
former
occupation
closing
his
lids
as
if
he
meant
to
drop
asleep
heathcliff
i
resumed
you
forgotten
all
kindness
to
you
last
winter
when
you
affirmed
you
loved
her
and
when
she
brought
you
books
and
sung
you
songs
and
came
many
a
time
through
wind
and
snow
to
see
you
she
wept
to
miss
one
evening
because
you
would
be
disappointed
and
you
felt
then
that
she
was
a
hundred
times
too
good
to
you
and
now
you
believe
the
lies
your
father
tells
though
you
know
he
detests
you
both
and
you
join
him
against
her
that
fine
gratitude
is
it
not
the
corner
of
linton
mouth
fell
and
he
took
the
from
his
lips
she
come
to
wuthering
heights
because
she
hated
you
i
continued
for
yourself
as
to
your
money
she
does
not
even
know
that
you
will
have
any
and
you
say
she
sick
and
yet
you
leave
her
alone
up
there
in
a
strange
house
you
who
have
felt
what
it
is
to
be
so
neglected
you
could
pity
your
own
sufferings
and
she
pitied
them
too
but
you
wo
pity
hers
i
shed
tears
master
heathcliff
you
see
an
elderly
woman
and
a
servant
merely
and
you
after
pretending
such
affection
and
having
reason
to
worship
her
almost
store
every
tear
you
have
for
yourself
and
lie
there
quite
at
ease
ah
you
a
heartless
selfish
boy
ca
stay
with
her
he
answered
crossly
not
stay
by
myself
she
cries
so
i
ca
bear
it
and
she
wo
give
over
though
i
say
call
my
father
i
did
call
him
once
and
he
threatened
to
strangle
her
if
she
was
not
quiet
but
she
began
again
the
instant
he
left
the
room
moaning
and
grieving
all
night
long
though
i
screamed
for
vexation
that
i
could
sleep
heathcliff
out
i
inquired
perceiving
that
the
wretched
creature
had
no
power
to
sympathize
with
his
cousin
mental
tortures
in
the
court
he
replied
to
doctor
kenneth
who
says
uncle
is
dying
truly
at
last
i
glad
for
i
shall
be
master
of
the
grange
after
him
catherine
always
spoke
of
it
as
her
house
it
hers
it
mine
papa
says
everything
she
has
is
mine
all
her
nice
books
are
mine
she
offered
to
give
me
them
and
her
pretty
birds
and
her
pony
minny
if
i
would
get
the
key
of
our
room
and
let
her
out
but
i
told
her
she
had
nothing
to
give
they
were
all
all
mine
and
then
she
cried
and
took
a
little
picture
from
her
neck
and
said
i
should
have
that
two
pictures
in
a
gold
case
on
one
side
her
mother
and
on
the
other
uncle
when
they
were
young
that
was
yesterday
i
said
they
were
mine
too
and
tried
to
get
them
from
her
the
spiteful
thing
would
let
me
she
pushed
me
off
and
hurt
me
i
shrieked
out
that
frightens
her
she
heard
papa
coming
and
she
broke
the
hinges
and
divided
the
case
and
gave
me
her
mother
portrait
the
other
she
attempted
to
hide
but
papa
asked
what
was
the
matter
and
i
explained
it
he
took
the
one
i
had
away
and
ordered
her
to
resign
hers
to
me
she
refused
and
he
he
struck
her
down
and
wrenched
it
off
the
chain
and
crushed
it
with
his
foot
were
you
pleased
to
see
her
struck
i
asked
having
my
designs
in
encouraging
his
talk
winked
he
answered
wink
to
see
my
father
strike
a
dog
or
a
horse
he
does
it
so
hard
yet
i
was
glad
at
first
she
deserved
punishing
for
pushing
me
but
when
papa
was
gone
she
made
me
come
to
the
window
and
showed
me
her
cheek
cut
on
the
inside
against
her
teeth
and
her
mouth
filling
with
blood
and
then
she
gathered
up
the
bits
of
the
picture
and
went
and
sat
down
with
her
face
to
the
wall
and
she
has
never
spoken
to
me
since
and
i
sometimes
think
she
ca
speak
for
pain
i
do
like
to
think
so
but
she
a
naughty
thing
for
crying
continually
and
she
looks
so
pale
and
wild
i
afraid
of
her
you
can
get
the
key
if
you
choose
i
said
when
i
am
he
answered
i
ca
walk
now
what
apartment
is
it
i
asked
he
cried
sha
tell
where
it
is
it
is
our
secret
nobody
neither
hareton
nor
zillah
is
to
know
there
you
tired
me
go
away
go
away
and
he
turned
his
face
on
to
his
arm
and
shut
his
eyes
again
i
considered
it
best
to
depart
without
seeing
heathcliff
and
bring
a
rescue
for
my
young
lady
from
the
grange
on
reaching
it
the
astonishment
of
my
to
see
me
and
their
joy
also
was
intense
and
when
they
heard
that
their
little
mistress
was
safe
two
or
three
were
about
to
hurry
up
and
shout
the
news
at
edgar
door
but
i
bespoke
the
announcement
of
it
myself
how
changed
i
found
him
even
in
those
few
days
he
lay
an
image
of
sadness
and
resignation
awaiting
his
death
very
young
he
looked
though
his
actual
age
was
one
would
have
called
him
ten
years
younger
at
least
he
thought
of
catherine
for
he
murmured
her
name
i
touched
his
hand
and
spoke
is
coming
dear
master
i
whispered
is
alive
and
well
and
will
be
here
i
hope
i
trembled
at
the
first
effects
of
this
intelligence
he
half
rose
up
looked
eagerly
round
the
apartment
and
then
sank
back
in
a
swoon
as
soon
as
he
recovered
i
related
our
compulsory
visit
and
detention
at
the
heights
i
said
heathcliff
forced
me
to
go
in
which
was
not
quite
true
i
uttered
as
little
as
possible
against
linton
nor
did
i
describe
all
his
father
brutal
conduct
my
intentions
being
to
add
no
bitterness
if
i
could
help
it
to
his
already
cup
he
divined
that
one
of
his
enemy
purposes
was
to
secure
the
personal
property
as
well
as
the
estate
to
his
son
or
rather
himself
yet
why
he
did
not
wait
till
his
decease
was
a
puzzle
to
my
master
because
ignorant
how
nearly
he
and
his
nephew
would
quit
the
world
together
however
he
felt
that
his
will
had
better
be
altered
instead
of
leaving
catherine
fortune
at
her
own
disposal
he
determined
to
put
it
in
the
hands
of
trustees
for
her
use
during
life
and
for
her
children
if
she
had
any
after
her
by
that
means
it
could
not
fall
to
heathcliff
should
linton
die
having
received
his
orders
i
despatched
a
man
to
fetch
the
attorney
and
four
more
provided
with
serviceable
weapons
to
demand
my
young
lady
of
her
jailor
both
parties
were
delayed
very
late
the
single
servant
returned
first
he
said
green
the
lawyer
was
out
when
he
arrived
at
his
house
and
he
had
to
wait
two
hours
for
his
and
then
green
told
him
he
had
a
little
business
in
the
village
that
must
be
done
but
he
would
be
at
thrushcross
grange
before
morning
the
four
men
came
back
unaccompanied
also
they
brought
word
that
catherine
was
ill
too
ill
to
quit
her
room
and
heathcliff
would
not
suffer
them
to
see
her
i
scolded
the
stupid
fellows
well
for
listening
to
that
tale
which
i
would
not
carry
to
my
master
resolving
to
take
a
whole
bevy
up
to
the
heights
at
and
storm
it
literally
unless
the
prisoner
were
quietly
surrendered
to
us
her
father
see
her
i
vowed
and
vowed
again
if
that
devil
be
killed
on
his
own
doorstones
in
trying
to
prevent
it
happily
i
was
spared
the
journey
and
the
trouble
i
had
gone
at
three
to
fetch
a
jug
of
water
and
was
passing
through
the
hall
with
it
in
my
hand
when
a
sharp
knock
at
the
front
door
made
me
jump
it
is
green
i
said
recollecting
myself
green
and
i
went
on
intending
to
send
somebody
else
to
open
it
but
the
knock
was
repeated
not
loud
and
still
importunately
i
put
the
jug
on
the
banister
and
hastened
to
admit
him
myself
the
harvest
moon
shone
clear
outside
it
was
not
the
attorney
my
own
sweet
little
mistress
sprang
on
my
neck
sobbing
ellen
is
papa
alive
i
cried
my
angel
he
is
god
be
thanked
you
are
safe
with
us
again
she
wanted
to
run
breathless
as
she
was
to
linton
room
but
i
compelled
her
to
sit
down
on
a
chair
and
made
her
drink
and
washed
her
pale
face
chafing
it
into
a
faint
colour
with
my
apron
then
i
said
i
must
go
first
and
tell
of
her
arrival
imploring
her
to
say
she
should
be
happy
with
young
heathcliff
she
stared
but
soon
comprehending
why
i
counselled
her
to
utter
the
falsehood
she
assured
me
she
would
not
complain
i
could
abide
to
be
present
at
their
meeting
i
stood
outside
the
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
hardly
ventured
near
the
bed
then
all
was
composed
however
catherine
despair
was
as
silent
as
her
father
joy
she
supported
him
calmly
in
appearance
and
he
fixed
on
her
features
his
raised
eyes
that
seemed
dilating
with
ecstasy
he
died
blissfully
lockwood
he
died
so
kissing
her
cheek
he
murmured
am
going
to
her
and
you
darling
child
shall
come
to
us
and
never
stirred
or
spoke
again
but
continued
that
rapt
radiant
gaze
till
his
pulse
imperceptibly
stopped
and
his
soul
departed
none
could
have
noticed
the
exact
minute
of
his
death
it
was
so
entirely
without
a
struggle
whether
catherine
had
spent
her
tears
or
whether
the
grief
were
too
weighty
to
let
them
flow
she
sat
there
till
the
sun
rose
she
sat
till
noon
and
would
still
have
remained
brooding
over
that
deathbed
but
i
insisted
on
her
coming
away
and
taking
some
repose
it
was
well
i
succeeded
in
removing
her
for
at
appeared
the
lawyer
having
called
at
wuthering
heights
to
get
his
instructions
how
to
behave
he
had
sold
himself
to
heathcliff
that
was
the
cause
of
his
delay
in
obeying
my
master
summons
fortunately
no
thought
of
worldly
affairs
crossed
the
latter
mind
to
disturb
him
after
his
daughter
arrival
green
took
upon
himself
to
order
everything
and
everybody
about
the
place
he
gave
all
the
servants
but
me
notice
to
quit
he
would
have
carried
his
delegated
authority
to
the
point
of
insisting
that
edgar
linton
should
not
be
buried
beside
his
wife
but
in
the
chapel
with
his
family
there
was
the
will
however
to
hinder
that
and
my
loud
protestations
against
any
infringement
of
its
directions
the
funeral
was
hurried
over
catherine
linton
heathcliff
now
was
suffered
to
stay
at
the
grange
till
her
father
corpse
had
quitted
it
she
told
me
that
her
anguish
had
at
last
spurred
linton
to
incur
the
risk
of
liberating
her
she
heard
the
men
i
sent
disputing
at
the
door
and
she
gathered
the
sense
of
heathcliff
answer
it
drove
her
desperate
linton
who
had
been
conveyed
up
to
the
little
parlour
soon
after
i
left
was
terrified
into
fetching
the
key
before
his
father
he
had
the
cunning
to
unlock
and
the
door
without
shutting
it
and
when
he
should
have
gone
to
bed
he
begged
to
sleep
with
hareton
and
his
petition
was
granted
for
once
catherine
stole
out
before
break
of
day
she
dared
not
try
the
doors
lest
the
dogs
should
raise
an
alarm
she
visited
the
empty
chambers
and
examined
their
windows
and
luckily
lighting
on
her
mother
she
got
easily
out
of
its
lattice
and
on
to
the
ground
by
means
of
the
close
by
her
accomplice
suffered
for
his
share
in
the
escape
notwithstanding
his
timid
contrivances
chapter
xxix
the
evening
after
the
funeral
my
young
lady
and
i
were
seated
in
the
library
now
musing
mournfully
one
of
us
despairingly
on
our
loss
now
venturing
conjectures
as
to
the
gloomy
future
we
had
just
agreed
the
best
destiny
which
could
await
catherine
would
be
a
permission
to
continue
resident
at
the
grange
at
least
during
life
he
being
allowed
to
join
her
there
and
i
to
remain
as
housekeeper
that
seemed
rather
too
favourable
an
arrangement
to
be
hoped
for
and
yet
i
did
hope
and
began
to
cheer
up
under
the
prospect
of
retaining
my
home
and
my
employment
and
above
all
my
beloved
young
mistress
when
a
servant
one
of
the
discarded
ones
not
yet
departed
rushed
hastily
in
and
said
devil
heathcliff
was
coming
through
the
court
should
he
fasten
the
door
in
his
face
if
we
had
been
mad
enough
to
order
that
proceeding
we
had
not
time
he
made
no
ceremony
of
knocking
or
announcing
his
name
he
was
master
and
availed
himself
of
the
master
privilege
to
walk
straight
in
without
saying
a
word
the
sound
of
our
informant
voice
directed
him
to
the
library
he
entered
and
motioning
him
out
shut
the
door
it
was
the
same
room
into
which
he
had
been
ushered
as
a
guest
eighteen
years
before
the
same
moon
shone
through
the
window
and
the
same
autumn
landscape
lay
outside
we
had
not
yet
lighted
a
candle
but
all
the
apartment
was
visible
even
to
the
portraits
on
the
wall
the
splendid
head
of
linton
and
the
graceful
one
of
her
husband
heathcliff
advanced
to
the
hearth
time
had
little
altered
his
person
either
there
was
the
same
man
his
dark
face
rather
sallower
and
more
composed
his
frame
a
stone
or
two
heavier
perhaps
and
no
other
difference
catherine
had
risen
with
an
impulse
to
dash
out
when
she
saw
him
he
said
arresting
her
by
the
arm
more
runnings
away
where
would
you
go
i
come
to
fetch
you
home
and
i
hope
you
be
a
dutiful
daughter
and
not
encourage
my
son
to
further
disobedience
i
was
embarrassed
how
to
punish
him
when
i
discovered
his
part
in
the
business
he
such
a
cobweb
a
pinch
would
annihilate
him
but
you
see
by
his
look
that
he
has
received
his
due
i
brought
him
down
one
evening
the
day
before
yesterday
and
just
set
him
in
a
chair
and
never
touched
him
afterwards
i
sent
hareton
out
and
we
had
the
room
to
ourselves
in
two
hours
i
called
joseph
to
carry
him
up
again
and
since
then
my
presence
is
as
potent
on
his
nerves
as
a
ghost
and
i
fancy
he
sees
me
often
though
i
am
not
near
hareton
says
he
wakes
and
shrieks
in
the
night
by
the
hour
together
and
calls
you
to
protect
him
from
me
and
whether
you
like
your
precious
mate
or
not
you
must
come
he
your
concern
now
i
yield
all
my
interest
in
him
to
you
not
let
catherine
continue
here
i
pleaded
send
master
linton
to
her
as
you
hate
them
both
you
not
miss
them
they
can
only
be
a
daily
plague
to
your
unnatural
heart
seeking
a
tenant
for
the
grange
he
answered
i
want
my
children
about
me
to
be
sure
besides
that
lass
owes
me
her
services
for
her
bread
i
not
going
to
nurture
her
in
luxury
and
idleness
after
linton
is
gone
make
haste
and
get
ready
now
and
do
oblige
me
to
compel
you
shall
said
catherine
is
all
i
have
to
love
in
the
world
and
though
you
have
done
what
you
could
to
make
him
hateful
to
me
and
me
to
him
you
can
not
make
us
hate
each
other
and
i
defy
you
to
hurt
him
when
i
am
by
and
i
defy
you
to
frighten
me
are
a
boastful
champion
replied
heathcliff
i
do
like
you
well
enough
to
hurt
him
you
shall
get
the
full
benefit
of
the
torment
as
long
as
it
lasts
it
is
not
i
who
will
make
him
hateful
to
you
it
is
his
own
sweet
spirit
he
as
bitter
as
gall
at
your
desertion
and
its
consequences
do
expect
thanks
for
this
noble
devotion
i
heard
him
draw
a
pleasant
picture
to
zillah
of
what
he
would
do
if
he
were
as
strong
as
i
the
inclination
is
there
and
his
very
weakness
will
sharpen
his
wits
to
find
a
substitute
for
strength
know
he
has
a
bad
nature
said
catherine
your
son
but
glad
i
a
better
to
forgive
it
and
i
know
he
loves
me
and
for
that
reason
i
love
him
heathcliff
have
to
love
you
and
however
miserable
you
make
us
we
shall
still
have
the
revenge
of
thinking
that
your
cruelty
arises
from
your
greater
misery
you
miserable
are
you
not
lonely
like
the
devil
and
envious
like
him
loves
you
will
cry
for
you
when
you
die
i
be
you
catherine
spoke
with
a
kind
of
dreary
triumph
she
seemed
to
have
made
up
her
mind
to
enter
into
the
spirit
of
her
future
family
and
draw
pleasure
from
the
griefs
of
her
enemies
shall
be
sorry
to
be
yourself
presently
said
her
you
stand
there
another
minute
begone
witch
and
get
your
things
she
scornfully
withdrew
in
her
absence
i
began
to
beg
for
place
at
the
heights
offering
to
resign
mine
to
her
but
he
would
suffer
it
on
no
account
he
bid
me
be
silent
and
then
for
the
first
time
allowed
himself
a
glance
round
the
room
and
a
look
at
the
pictures
having
studied
linton
he
said
shall
have
that
home
not
because
i
need
it
but
he
turned
abruptly
to
the
fire
and
continued
with
what
for
lack
of
a
better
word
i
must
call
a
smile
tell
you
what
i
did
yesterday
i
got
the
sexton
who
was
digging
linton
grave
to
remove
the
earth
off
her
coffin
lid
and
i
opened
it
i
thought
once
i
would
have
stayed
there
when
i
saw
her
face
again
it
is
hers
yet
he
had
hard
work
to
stir
me
but
he
said
it
would
change
if
the
air
blew
on
it
and
so
i
struck
one
side
of
the
coffin
loose
and
covered
it
up
not
linton
side
damn
him
i
wish
he
been
soldered
in
lead
and
i
bribed
the
sexton
to
pull
it
away
when
i
laid
there
and
slide
mine
out
too
i
have
it
made
so
and
then
by
the
time
linton
gets
to
us
he
not
know
which
is
which
were
very
wicked
mr
heathcliff
i
exclaimed
you
not
ashamed
to
disturb
the
dead
disturbed
nobody
nelly
he
replied
i
gave
some
ease
to
myself
i
shall
be
a
great
deal
more
comfortable
now
and
you
have
a
better
chance
of
keeping
me
underground
when
i
get
there
disturbed
her
no
she
has
disturbed
me
night
and
day
through
eighteen
years
incessantly
remorselessly
till
yesternight
and
yesternight
i
was
tranquil
i
dreamt
i
was
sleeping
the
last
sleep
by
that
sleeper
with
my
heart
stopped
and
my
cheek
frozen
against
hers
if
she
had
been
dissolved
into
earth
or
worse
what
would
you
have
dreamt
of
then
i
said
dissolving
with
her
and
being
more
happy
still
he
answered
you
suppose
i
dread
any
change
of
that
sort
i
expected
such
a
transformation
on
raising
the
lid
but
i
better
pleased
that
it
should
not
commence
till
i
share
it
besides
unless
i
had
received
a
distinct
impression
of
her
passionless
features
that
strange
feeling
would
hardly
have
been
removed
it
began
oddly
you
know
i
was
wild
after
she
died
and
eternally
from
dawn
to
dawn
praying
her
to
return
to
me
her
spirit
i
have
a
strong
faith
in
ghosts
i
have
a
conviction
that
they
can
and
do
exist
among
us
the
day
she
was
buried
there
came
a
fall
of
snow
in
the
evening
i
went
to
the
churchyard
it
blew
bleak
as
winter
all
round
was
solitary
i
did
fear
that
her
fool
of
a
husband
would
wander
up
the
glen
so
late
and
no
one
else
had
business
to
bring
them
there
being
alone
and
conscious
two
yards
of
loose
earth
was
the
sole
barrier
between
us
i
said
to
myself
i
have
her
in
my
arms
again
if
she
be
cold
i
think
it
is
this
north
wind
that
chills
and
if
she
be
motionless
it
is
sleep
i
got
a
spade
from
the
and
began
to
delve
with
all
my
might
it
scraped
the
coffin
i
fell
to
work
with
my
hands
the
wood
commenced
cracking
about
the
screws
i
was
on
the
point
of
attaining
my
object
when
it
seemed
that
i
heard
a
sigh
from
some
one
above
close
at
the
edge
of
the
grave
and
bending
down
if
i
can
only
get
this
off
i
muttered
i
wish
they
may
shovel
in
the
earth
over
us
both
and
i
wrenched
at
it
more
desperately
still
there
was
another
sigh
close
at
my
ear
i
appeared
to
feel
the
warm
breath
of
it
displacing
the
wind
i
knew
no
living
thing
in
flesh
and
blood
was
by
but
as
certainly
as
you
perceive
the
approach
to
some
substantial
body
in
the
dark
though
it
can
not
be
discerned
so
certainly
i
felt
that
cathy
was
there
not
under
me
but
on
the
earth
a
sudden
sense
of
relief
flowed
from
my
heart
through
every
limb
i
relinquished
my
labour
of
agony
and
turned
consoled
at
once
unspeakably
consoled
her
presence
was
with
me
it
remained
while
i
the
grave
and
led
me
home
you
may
laugh
if
you
will
but
i
was
sure
i
should
see
her
there
i
was
sure
she
was
with
me
and
i
could
not
help
talking
to
her
having
reached
the
heights
i
rushed
eagerly
to
the
door
it
was
fastened
and
i
remember
that
accursed
earnshaw
and
my
wife
opposed
my
entrance
i
remember
stopping
to
kick
the
breath
out
of
him
and
then
hurrying
to
my
room
and
hers
i
looked
round
impatiently
i
felt
her
by
me
i
could
see
her
and
yet
i
i
ought
to
have
sweat
blood
then
from
the
anguish
of
my
yearning
from
the
fervour
of
my
supplications
to
have
but
one
glimpse
i
had
not
one
she
showed
herself
as
she
often
was
in
life
a
devil
to
me
and
since
then
sometimes
more
and
sometimes
less
i
been
the
sport
of
that
intolerable
torture
infernal
keeping
my
nerves
at
such
a
stretch
that
if
they
had
not
resembled
catgut
they
would
long
ago
have
relaxed
to
the
feebleness
of
linton
when
i
sat
in
the
house
with
hareton
it
seemed
that
on
going
out
i
should
meet
her
when
i
walked
on
the
moors
i
should
meet
her
coming
in
when
i
went
from
home
i
hastened
to
return
she
be
somewhere
at
the
heights
i
was
certain
and
when
i
slept
in
her
chamber
i
was
beaten
out
of
that
i
could
lie
there
for
the
moment
i
closed
my
eyes
she
was
either
outside
the
window
or
sliding
back
the
panels
or
entering
the
room
or
even
resting
her
darling
head
on
the
same
pillow
as
she
did
when
a
child
and
i
must
open
my
lids
to
see
and
so
i
opened
and
closed
them
a
hundred
times
a
night
to
be
always
disappointed
it
racked
me
i
often
groaned
aloud
till
that
old
rascal
joseph
no
doubt
believed
that
my
conscience
was
playing
the
fiend
inside
of
me
now
since
i
seen
her
i
pacified
a
little
it
was
a
strange
way
of
killing
not
by
inches
but
by
fractions
of
hairbreadths
to
beguile
me
with
the
spectre
of
a
hope
through
eighteen
years
heathcliff
paused
and
wiped
his
forehead
his
hair
clung
to
it
wet
with
perspiration
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
red
embers
of
the
fire
the
brows
not
contracted
but
raised
next
the
temples
diminishing
the
grim
aspect
of
his
countenance
but
imparting
a
peculiar
look
of
trouble
and
a
painful
appearance
of
mental
tension
towards
one
absorbing
subject
he
only
half
addressed
me
and
i
maintained
silence
i
did
like
to
hear
him
talk
after
a
short
period
he
resumed
his
meditation
on
the
picture
took
it
down
and
leant
it
against
the
sofa
to
contemplate
it
at
better
advantage
and
while
so
occupied
catherine
entered
announcing
that
she
was
ready
when
her
pony
should
be
saddled
that
over
said
heathcliff
to
me
then
turning
to
her
he
added
may
do
without
your
pony
it
is
a
fine
evening
and
need
no
ponies
at
wuthering
heights
for
what
journeys
you
take
your
own
feet
will
serve
you
come
along
ellen
whispered
my
dear
little
mistress
as
she
kissed
me
her
lips
felt
like
ice
and
see
me
ellen
forget
care
you
do
no
such
thing
mrs
dean
said
her
new
father
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
i
come
here
i
want
none
of
your
prying
at
my
house
he
signed
her
to
precede
him
and
casting
back
a
look
that
cut
my
heart
she
obeyed
i
watched
them
from
the
window
walk
down
the
garden
heathcliff
fixed
catherine
arm
under
his
though
she
disputed
the
act
at
first
evidently
and
with
rapid
strides
he
hurried
her
into
the
alley
whose
trees
concealed
them
chapter
xxx
i
have
paid
a
visit
to
the
heights
but
i
have
not
seen
her
since
she
left
joseph
held
the
door
in
his
hand
when
i
called
to
ask
after
her
and
would
let
me
pass
he
said
linton
was
and
the
master
was
not
in
zillah
has
told
me
something
of
the
way
they
go
on
otherwise
i
should
hardly
know
who
was
dead
and
who
living
she
thinks
catherine
haughty
and
does
not
like
her
i
can
guess
by
her
talk
my
young
lady
asked
some
aid
of
her
when
she
first
came
but
heathcliff
told
her
to
follow
her
own
business
and
let
his
look
after
herself
and
zillah
willingly
acquiesced
being
a
selfish
woman
catherine
evinced
a
child
annoyance
at
this
neglect
repaid
it
with
contempt
and
thus
enlisted
my
informant
among
her
enemies
as
securely
as
if
she
had
done
her
some
great
wrong
i
had
a
long
talk
with
zillah
about
six
weeks
ago
a
little
before
you
came
one
day
when
we
foregathered
on
the
moor
and
this
is
what
she
told
me
first
thing
linton
did
she
said
her
arrival
at
the
heights
was
to
run
without
even
wishing
to
me
and
joseph
she
shut
herself
into
linton
room
and
remained
till
morning
then
while
the
master
and
earnshaw
were
at
breakfast
she
entered
the
house
and
asked
all
in
a
quiver
if
the
doctor
might
be
sent
for
her
cousin
was
very
we
know
that
answered
heathcliff
but
his
life
is
not
worth
a
farthing
and
i
wo
spend
a
farthing
on
him
but
i
can
not
tell
how
to
do
she
said
and
if
nobody
will
help
me
he
die
walk
out
of
the
room
cried
the
master
and
let
me
never
hear
a
word
more
about
him
none
here
care
what
becomes
of
him
if
you
do
act
the
nurse
if
you
do
not
lock
him
up
and
leave
him
she
began
to
bother
me
and
i
said
i
had
enough
plague
with
the
tiresome
thing
we
each
had
our
tasks
and
hers
was
to
wait
on
linton
heathcliff
bid
me
leave
that
labour
to
her
they
managed
together
i
ca
tell
i
fancy
he
fretted
a
great
deal
and
moaned
hisseln
night
and
day
and
she
had
precious
little
rest
one
could
guess
by
her
white
face
and
heavy
eyes
she
sometimes
came
into
the
kitchen
all
wildered
like
and
looked
as
if
she
would
fain
beg
assistance
but
i
was
not
going
to
disobey
the
master
i
never
dare
disobey
him
dean
and
though
i
thought
it
wrong
that
kenneth
should
not
be
sent
for
it
was
no
concern
of
mine
either
to
advise
or
complain
and
i
always
refused
to
meddle
once
or
twice
after
we
had
gone
to
bed
i
happened
to
open
my
door
again
and
seen
her
sitting
crying
on
the
and
then
i
shut
myself
in
quick
for
fear
of
being
moved
to
interfere
i
did
pity
her
then
i
sure
still
i
did
wish
to
lose
my
place
you
know
last
one
night
she
came
boldly
into
my
chamber
and
frightened
me
out
of
my
wits
by
saying
tell
heathcliff
that
his
son
is
dying
sure
he
is
this
time
get
up
instantly
and
tell
him
uttered
this
speech
she
vanished
again
i
lay
a
quarter
of
an
hour
listening
and
trembling
nothing
stirred
the
house
was
quiet
mistaken
i
said
to
myself
he
got
over
it
i
need
disturb
them
and
i
began
to
doze
but
my
sleep
was
marred
a
second
time
by
a
sharp
ringing
of
the
bell
the
only
bell
we
have
put
up
on
purpose
for
linton
and
the
master
called
to
me
to
see
what
was
the
matter
and
inform
them
that
he
would
have
that
noise
repeated
delivered
catherine
message
he
cursed
to
himself
and
in
a
few
minutes
came
out
with
a
lighted
candle
and
proceeded
to
their
room
i
followed
heathcliff
was
seated
by
the
bedside
with
her
hands
folded
on
her
knees
her
went
up
held
the
light
to
linton
face
looked
at
him
and
touched
him
afterwards
he
turned
to
her
now
catherine
he
said
how
do
you
feel
was
dumb
how
do
you
feel
catherine
he
repeated
he
safe
and
i
free
she
answered
i
should
feel
well
but
she
continued
with
a
bitterness
she
could
conceal
you
have
left
me
so
long
to
struggle
against
death
alone
that
i
feel
and
see
only
death
i
feel
like
death
she
looked
like
it
too
i
gave
her
a
little
wine
hareton
and
joseph
who
had
been
wakened
by
the
ringing
and
the
sound
of
feet
and
heard
our
talk
from
outside
now
entered
joseph
was
fain
i
believe
of
the
lad
removal
hareton
seemed
a
thought
bothered
though
he
was
more
taken
up
with
staring
at
catherine
than
thinking
of
linton
but
the
master
bid
him
get
off
to
bed
again
we
did
want
his
help
he
afterwards
made
joseph
remove
the
body
to
his
chamber
and
told
me
to
return
to
mine
and
heathcliff
remained
by
herself
the
morning
he
sent
me
to
tell
her
she
must
come
down
to
breakfast
she
had
undressed
and
appeared
going
to
sleep
and
said
she
was
ill
at
which
i
hardly
wondered
i
informed
heathcliff
and
he
replied
well
let
her
be
till
after
the
funeral
and
go
up
now
and
then
to
get
her
what
is
needful
and
as
soon
as
she
seems
better
tell
me
cathy
stayed
upstairs
a
fortnight
according
to
zillah
who
visited
her
twice
a
day
and
would
have
been
rather
more
friendly
but
her
attempts
at
increasing
kindness
were
proudly
and
promptly
repelled
heathcliff
went
up
once
to
show
her
linton
will
he
had
bequeathed
the
whole
of
his
and
what
had
been
her
moveable
property
to
his
father
the
poor
creature
was
threatened
or
coaxed
into
that
act
during
her
week
absence
when
his
uncle
died
the
lands
being
a
minor
he
could
not
meddle
with
however
heathcliff
has
claimed
and
kept
them
in
his
wife
right
and
his
also
i
suppose
legally
at
any
rate
catherine
destitute
of
cash
and
friends
can
not
disturb
his
possession
said
zillah
approached
her
door
except
that
once
but
i
and
nobody
asked
anything
about
her
the
first
occasion
of
her
coming
down
into
the
house
was
on
a
sunday
afternoon
she
had
cried
out
when
i
carried
up
her
dinner
that
she
could
bear
any
longer
being
in
the
cold
and
i
told
her
the
master
was
going
to
thrushcross
grange
and
earnshaw
and
i
need
hinder
her
from
descending
so
as
soon
as
she
heard
heathcliff
horse
trot
off
she
made
her
appearance
donned
in
black
and
her
yellow
curls
combed
back
behind
her
ears
as
plain
as
a
quaker
she
could
comb
them
out
and
i
generally
go
to
chapel
on
sundays
the
kirk
you
know
has
no
minister
now
explained
dean
and
they
call
the
methodists
or
baptists
place
i
ca
say
which
it
is
at
gimmerton
a
chapel
had
gone
she
continued
i
thought
proper
to
bide
at
home
young
folks
are
always
the
better
for
an
elder
and
hareton
with
all
his
bashfulness
is
a
model
of
nice
behaviour
i
let
him
know
that
his
cousin
would
very
likely
sit
with
us
and
she
had
been
always
used
to
see
the
sabbath
respected
so
he
had
as
good
leave
his
guns
and
bits
of
indoor
work
alone
while
she
stayed
he
coloured
up
at
the
news
and
cast
his
eyes
over
his
hands
and
clothes
the
and
gunpowder
were
shoved
out
of
sight
in
a
minute
i
saw
he
meant
to
give
her
his
company
and
i
guessed
by
his
way
he
wanted
to
be
presentable
so
laughing
as
i
durst
not
laugh
when
the
master
is
by
i
offered
to
help
him
if
he
would
and
joked
at
his
confusion
he
grew
sullen
and
began
to
swear
dean
zillah
went
on
seeing
me
not
pleased
by
her
manner
happen
think
your
young
lady
too
fine
for
hareton
and
happen
you
right
but
i
own
i
should
love
well
to
bring
her
pride
a
peg
lower
and
what
will
all
her
learning
and
her
daintiness
do
for
her
now
she
as
poor
as
you
or
i
poorer
i
be
bound
you
saying
and
i
doing
my
little
all
that
road
hareton
allowed
zillah
to
give
him
her
aid
and
she
flattered
him
into
a
good
humour
so
when
catherine
came
half
forgetting
her
former
insults
he
tried
to
make
himself
agreeable
by
the
housekeeper
account
walked
in
she
said
chill
as
an
icicle
and
as
high
as
a
princess
i
got
up
and
offered
her
my
seat
in
the
no
she
turned
up
her
nose
at
my
civility
earnshaw
rose
too
and
bid
her
come
to
the
settle
and
sit
close
by
the
fire
he
was
sure
she
was
starved
i
been
starved
a
month
and
more
she
answered
resting
on
the
word
as
scornful
as
she
could
she
got
a
chair
for
herself
and
placed
it
at
a
distance
from
both
of
us
having
sat
till
she
was
warm
she
began
to
look
round
and
discovered
a
number
of
books
on
the
dresser
she
was
instantly
upon
her
feet
again
stretching
to
reach
them
but
they
were
too
high
up
her
cousin
after
watching
her
endeavours
a
while
at
last
summoned
courage
to
help
her
she
held
her
frock
and
he
filled
it
with
the
first
that
came
to
hand
was
a
great
advance
for
the
lad
she
did
thank
him
still
he
felt
gratified
that
she
had
accepted
his
assistance
and
ventured
to
stand
behind
as
she
examined
them
and
even
to
stoop
and
point
out
what
struck
his
fancy
in
certain
old
pictures
which
they
contained
nor
was
he
daunted
by
the
saucy
style
in
which
she
jerked
the
page
from
his
finger
he
contented
himself
with
going
a
bit
farther
back
and
looking
at
her
instead
of
the
book
she
continued
reading
or
seeking
for
something
to
read
his
attention
became
by
degrees
quite
centred
in
the
study
of
her
thick
silky
curls
her
face
he
could
see
and
she
could
see
him
and
perhaps
not
quite
awake
to
what
he
did
but
attracted
like
a
child
to
a
candle
at
last
he
proceeded
from
staring
to
touching
he
put
out
his
hand
and
stroked
one
curl
as
gently
as
if
it
were
a
bird
he
might
have
stuck
a
knife
into
her
neck
she
started
round
in
such
a
taking
get
away
this
moment
how
dare
you
touch
me
why
are
you
stopping
there
she
cried
in
a
tone
of
disgust
i
ca
endure
you
i
go
upstairs
again
if
you
come
near
me
hareton
recoiled
looking
as
foolish
as
he
could
do
he
sat
down
in
the
settle
very
quiet
and
she
continued
turning
over
her
volumes
another
half
hour
finally
earnshaw
crossed
over
and
whispered
to
me
will
you
ask
her
to
read
to
us
zillah
i
stalled
of
doing
naught
and
i
do
like
i
could
like
to
hear
her
dunnot
say
i
wanted
it
but
ask
of
yourseln
hareton
wishes
you
would
read
to
us
i
said
immediately
he
take
it
very
kind
he
be
much
obliged
frowned
and
looking
up
answered
hareton
and
the
whole
set
of
you
will
be
good
enough
to
understand
that
i
reject
any
pretence
at
kindness
you
have
the
hypocrisy
to
offer
i
despise
you
and
will
have
nothing
to
say
to
any
of
you
when
i
would
have
given
my
life
for
one
kind
word
even
to
see
one
of
your
faces
you
all
kept
off
but
i
wo
complain
to
you
i
driven
down
here
by
the
cold
not
either
to
amuse
you
or
enjoy
your
society
what
could
i
ha
done
began
earnshaw
how
was
i
to
blame
oh
you
are
an
exception
answered
heathcliff
i
never
missed
such
a
concern
as
you
but
i
offered
more
than
once
and
asked
he
said
kindling
up
at
her
pertness
i
asked
heathcliff
to
let
me
wake
for
you
be
silent
i
go
out
of
doors
or
anywhere
rather
than
have
your
disagreeable
voice
in
my
ear
said
my
lady
muttered
she
might
go
to
hell
for
him
and
unslinging
his
gun
restrained
himself
from
his
sunday
occupations
no
longer
he
talked
now
freely
enough
and
she
presently
saw
fit
to
retreat
to
her
solitude
but
the
frost
had
set
in
and
in
spite
of
her
pride
she
was
forced
to
condescend
to
our
company
more
and
more
however
i
took
care
there
should
be
no
further
scorning
at
my
good
nature
ever
since
i
been
as
stiff
as
herself
and
she
has
no
lover
or
liker
among
us
and
she
does
not
deserve
one
for
let
them
say
the
least
word
to
her
and
she
curl
back
without
respect
of
any
one
she
snap
at
the
master
himself
and
as
good
as
dares
him
to
thrash
her
and
the
more
hurt
she
gets
the
more
venomous
she
grows
at
first
on
hearing
this
account
from
zillah
i
determined
to
leave
my
situation
take
a
cottage
and
get
catherine
to
come
and
live
with
me
but
heathcliff
would
as
soon
permit
that
as
he
would
set
up
hareton
in
an
independent
house
and
i
can
see
no
remedy
at
present
unless
she
could
marry
again
and
that
scheme
it
does
not
come
within
my
province
to
arrange
thus
ended
dean
story
notwithstanding
the
doctor
prophecy
i
am
rapidly
recovering
strength
and
though
it
be
only
the
second
week
in
january
i
propose
getting
out
on
horseback
in
a
day
or
two
and
riding
over
to
wuthering
heights
to
inform
my
landlord
that
i
shall
spend
the
next
six
months
in
london
and
if
he
likes
he
may
look
out
for
another
tenant
to
take
the
place
after
october
i
would
not
pass
another
winter
here
for
much
chapter
xxxi
yesterday
was
bright
calm
and
frosty
i
went
to
the
heights
as
i
proposed
my
housekeeper
entreated
me
to
bear
a
little
note
from
her
to
her
young
lady
and
i
did
not
refuse
for
the
worthy
woman
was
not
conscious
of
anything
odd
in
her
request
the
front
door
stood
open
but
the
jealous
gate
was
fastened
as
at
my
last
visit
i
knocked
and
invoked
earnshaw
from
among
the
he
unchained
it
and
i
entered
the
fellow
is
as
handsome
a
rustic
as
need
be
seen
i
took
particular
notice
of
him
this
time
but
then
he
does
his
best
apparently
to
make
the
least
of
his
advantages
i
asked
if
heathcliff
were
at
home
he
answered
no
but
he
would
be
in
at
it
was
eleven
and
i
announced
my
intention
of
going
in
and
waiting
for
him
at
which
he
immediately
flung
down
his
tools
and
accompanied
me
in
the
office
of
watchdog
not
as
a
substitute
for
the
host
we
entered
together
catherine
was
there
making
herself
useful
in
preparing
some
vegetables
for
the
approaching
meal
she
looked
more
sulky
and
less
spirited
than
when
i
had
seen
her
first
she
hardly
raised
her
eyes
to
notice
me
and
continued
her
employment
with
the
same
disregard
to
common
forms
of
politeness
as
before
never
returning
my
bow
and
by
the
slightest
acknowledgment
does
not
seem
so
amiable
i
thought
dean
would
persuade
me
to
believe
she
a
beauty
it
is
true
but
not
an
angel
earnshaw
surlily
bid
her
remove
her
things
to
the
kitchen
them
yourself
she
said
pushing
them
from
her
as
soon
as
she
had
done
and
retiring
to
a
stool
by
the
window
where
she
began
to
carve
figures
of
birds
and
beasts
out
of
the
in
her
lap
i
approached
her
pretending
to
desire
a
view
of
the
garden
and
as
i
fancied
adroitly
dropped
dean
note
on
to
her
knee
unnoticed
by
hareton
but
she
asked
aloud
is
that
and
chucked
it
off
letter
from
your
old
acquaintance
the
housekeeper
at
the
grange
i
answered
annoyed
at
her
exposing
my
kind
deed
and
fearful
lest
it
should
be
imagined
a
missive
of
my
own
she
would
gladly
have
gathered
it
up
at
this
information
but
hareton
beat
her
he
seized
and
put
it
in
his
waistcoat
saying
heathcliff
should
look
at
it
first
thereat
catherine
silently
turned
her
face
from
us
and
very
stealthily
drew
out
her
and
applied
it
to
her
eyes
and
her
cousin
after
struggling
awhile
to
keep
down
his
softer
feelings
pulled
out
the
letter
and
flung
it
on
the
floor
beside
her
as
ungraciously
as
he
could
catherine
caught
and
perused
it
eagerly
then
she
put
a
few
questions
to
me
concerning
the
inmates
rational
and
irrational
of
her
former
home
and
gazing
towards
the
hills
murmured
in
soliloquy
should
like
to
be
riding
minny
down
there
i
should
like
to
be
climbing
up
there
oh
i
tired
i
hareton
and
she
leant
her
pretty
head
back
against
the
sill
with
half
a
yawn
and
half
a
sigh
and
lapsed
into
an
aspect
of
abstracted
sadness
neither
caring
nor
knowing
whether
we
remarked
her
heathcliff
i
said
after
sitting
some
time
mute
are
not
aware
that
i
am
an
acquaintance
of
yours
so
intimate
that
i
think
it
strange
you
wo
come
and
speak
to
me
my
housekeeper
never
wearies
of
talking
about
and
praising
you
and
she
be
greatly
disappointed
if
i
return
with
no
news
of
or
from
you
except
that
you
received
her
letter
and
said
nothing
she
appeared
to
wonder
at
this
speech
and
asked
ellen
like
you
very
well
i
replied
hesitatingly
must
tell
her
she
continued
i
would
answer
her
letter
but
i
have
no
materials
for
writing
not
even
a
book
from
which
i
might
tear
a
leaf
books
i
exclaimed
do
you
contrive
to
live
here
without
them
if
i
may
take
the
liberty
to
inquire
though
provided
with
a
large
library
i
frequently
very
dull
at
the
grange
take
my
books
away
and
i
should
be
desperate
was
always
reading
when
i
had
them
said
catherine
heathcliff
never
reads
so
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
destroy
my
books
i
have
not
had
a
glimpse
of
one
for
weeks
only
once
i
searched
through
joseph
store
of
theology
to
his
great
irritation
and
once
hareton
i
came
upon
a
secret
stock
in
your
room
some
latin
and
greek
and
some
tales
and
poetry
all
old
friends
i
brought
the
last
here
and
you
gathered
them
as
a
magpie
gathers
silver
spoons
for
the
mere
love
of
stealing
they
are
of
no
use
to
you
or
else
you
concealed
them
in
the
bad
spirit
that
as
you
can
not
enjoy
them
nobody
else
shall
perhaps
envy
counselled
heathcliff
to
rob
me
of
my
treasures
but
i
most
of
them
written
on
my
brain
and
printed
in
my
heart
and
you
can
not
deprive
me
of
those
earnshaw
blushed
crimson
when
his
cousin
made
this
revelation
of
his
private
literary
accumulations
and
stammered
an
indignant
denial
of
her
accusations
hareton
is
desirous
of
increasing
his
amount
of
knowledge
i
said
coming
to
his
rescue
is
not
but
of
your
attainments
he
be
a
clever
scholar
in
a
few
years
he
wants
me
to
sink
into
a
dunce
meantime
answered
catherine
i
hear
him
trying
to
spell
and
read
to
himself
and
pretty
blunders
he
makes
i
wish
you
would
repeat
chevy
chase
as
you
did
yesterday
it
was
extremely
funny
i
heard
you
and
i
heard
you
turning
over
the
dictionary
to
seek
out
the
hard
words
and
then
cursing
because
you
could
read
their
explanations
the
young
man
evidently
thought
it
too
bad
that
he
should
be
laughed
at
for
his
ignorance
and
then
laughed
at
for
trying
to
remove
it
i
had
a
similar
notion
and
remembering
dean
anecdote
of
his
first
attempt
at
enlightening
the
darkness
in
which
he
had
been
reared
i
observed
heathcliff
we
have
each
had
a
commencement
and
each
stumbled
and
tottered
on
the
threshold
had
our
teachers
scorned
instead
of
aiding
us
we
should
stumble
and
totter
yet
she
replied
do
wish
to
limit
his
acquirements
still
he
has
no
right
to
appropriate
what
is
mine
and
make
it
ridiculous
to
me
with
his
vile
mistakes
and
mispronunciations
those
books
both
prose
and
verse
are
consecrated
to
me
by
other
associations
and
i
hate
to
have
them
debased
and
profaned
in
his
mouth
besides
of
all
he
has
selected
my
favourite
pieces
that
i
love
the
most
to
repeat
as
if
out
of
deliberate
malice
hareton
chest
heaved
in
silence
a
minute
he
laboured
under
a
severe
sense
of
mortification
and
wrath
which
it
was
no
easy
task
to
suppress
i
rose
and
from
a
gentlemanly
idea
of
relieving
his
embarrassment
took
up
my
station
in
the
doorway
surveying
the
external
prospect
as
i
stood
he
followed
my
example
and
left
the
room
but
presently
reappeared
bearing
half
a
dozen
volumes
in
his
hands
which
he
threw
into
catherine
lap
exclaiming
them
i
never
want
to
hear
or
read
or
think
of
them
again
wo
have
them
now
she
answered
shall
connect
them
with
you
and
hate
them
she
opened
one
that
had
obviously
been
often
turned
over
and
read
a
portion
in
the
drawling
tone
of
a
beginner
then
laughed
and
threw
it
from
her
listen
she
continued
provokingly
commencing
a
verse
of
an
old
ballad
in
the
same
fashion
but
his
would
endure
no
further
torment
i
heard
and
not
altogether
disapprovingly
a
manual
check
given
to
her
saucy
tongue
the
little
wretch
had
done
her
utmost
to
hurt
her
cousin
sensitive
though
uncultivated
feelings
and
a
physical
argument
was
the
only
mode
he
had
of
balancing
the
account
and
repaying
its
effects
on
the
inflictor
he
afterwards
gathered
the
books
and
hurled
them
on
the
fire
i
read
in
his
countenance
what
anguish
it
was
to
offer
that
sacrifice
to
spleen
i
fancied
that
as
they
consumed
he
recalled
the
pleasure
they
had
already
imparted
and
the
triumph
and
pleasure
he
had
anticipated
from
them
and
i
fancied
i
guessed
the
incitement
to
his
secret
studies
also
he
had
been
content
with
daily
labour
and
rough
animal
enjoyments
till
catherine
crossed
his
path
shame
at
her
scorn
and
hope
of
her
approval
were
his
first
prompters
to
higher
pursuits
and
instead
of
guarding
him
from
one
and
winning
him
to
the
other
his
endeavours
to
raise
himself
had
produced
just
the
contrary
result
that
all
the
good
that
such
a
brute
as
you
can
get
from
them
cried
catherine
sucking
her
damaged
lip
and
watching
the
conflagration
with
indignant
eyes
hold
your
tongue
now
he
answered
fiercely
and
his
agitation
precluded
further
speech
he
advanced
hastily
to
the
entrance
where
i
made
way
for
him
to
pass
but
ere
he
had
crossed
the
heathcliff
coming
up
the
causeway
encountered
him
and
laying
hold
of
his
shoulder
asked
to
do
now
my
lad
naught
he
said
and
broke
away
to
enjoy
his
grief
and
anger
in
solitude
heathcliff
gazed
after
him
and
sighed
will
be
odd
if
i
thwart
myself
he
muttered
unconscious
that
i
was
behind
him
when
i
look
for
his
father
in
his
face
i
find
every
day
more
how
the
devil
is
he
so
like
i
can
hardly
bear
to
see
him
he
bent
his
eyes
to
the
ground
and
walked
moodily
in
there
was
a
restless
anxious
expression
in
his
countenance
i
had
never
remarked
there
before
and
he
looked
sparer
in
person
his
on
perceiving
him
through
the
window
immediately
escaped
to
the
kitchen
so
that
i
remained
alone
glad
to
see
you
out
of
doors
again
lockwood
he
said
in
reply
to
my
greeting
selfish
motives
partly
i
do
think
i
could
readily
supply
your
loss
in
this
desolation
i
wondered
more
than
once
what
brought
you
here
idle
whim
i
fear
sir
was
my
answer
else
an
idle
whim
is
going
to
spirit
me
away
i
shall
set
out
for
london
next
week
and
i
must
give
you
warning
that
i
feel
no
disposition
to
retain
thrushcross
grange
beyond
the
twelve
months
i
agreed
to
rent
it
i
believe
i
shall
not
live
there
any
more
indeed
you
tired
of
being
banished
from
the
world
are
you
he
said
if
you
be
coming
to
plead
off
paying
for
a
place
you
occupy
your
journey
is
useless
i
never
relent
in
exacting
my
due
from
any
one
coming
to
plead
off
nothing
about
it
i
exclaimed
considerably
irritated
you
wish
it
i
settle
with
you
now
and
i
drew
my
from
my
pocket
no
he
replied
coolly
leave
sufficient
behind
to
cover
your
debts
if
you
fail
to
return
i
not
in
such
a
hurry
sit
down
and
take
your
dinner
with
us
a
guest
that
is
safe
from
repeating
his
visit
can
generally
be
made
welcome
catherine
bring
the
things
in
where
are
you
catherine
reappeared
bearing
a
tray
of
knives
and
forks
may
get
your
dinner
with
joseph
muttered
heathcliff
aside
remain
in
the
kitchen
till
he
is
gone
she
obeyed
his
directions
very
punctually
perhaps
she
had
no
temptation
to
transgress
living
among
clowns
and
misanthropists
she
probably
can
not
appreciate
a
better
class
of
people
when
she
meets
them
with
heathcliff
grim
and
saturnine
on
the
one
hand
and
hareton
absolutely
dumb
on
the
other
i
made
a
somewhat
cheerless
meal
and
bade
adieu
early
i
would
have
departed
by
the
back
way
to
get
a
last
glimpse
of
catherine
and
annoy
old
joseph
but
hareton
received
orders
to
lead
up
my
horse
and
my
host
himself
escorted
me
to
the
door
so
i
could
not
fulfil
my
wish
dreary
life
gets
over
in
that
house
i
reflected
while
riding
down
the
road
a
realisation
of
something
more
romantic
than
a
fairy
tale
it
would
have
been
for
linton
heathcliff
had
she
and
i
struck
up
an
attachment
as
her
good
nurse
desired
and
migrated
together
into
the
stirring
atmosphere
of
the
town
chapter
xxxii
this
september
i
was
invited
to
devastate
the
moors
of
a
friend
in
the
north
and
on
my
journey
to
his
abode
i
unexpectedly
came
within
fifteen
miles
of
gimmerton
the
ostler
at
a
roadside
was
holding
a
pail
of
water
to
refresh
my
horses
when
a
cart
of
very
green
oats
newly
reaped
passed
by
and
he
remarked
frough
gimmerton
nah
they
allas
three
wick
after
other
folk
wi
ther
harvest
i
repeated
my
residence
in
that
locality
had
already
grown
dim
and
dreamy
i
know
how
far
is
it
from
this
fourteen
mile
th
hills
and
a
rough
road
he
answered
a
sudden
impulse
seized
me
to
visit
thrushcross
grange
it
was
scarcely
noon
and
i
conceived
that
i
might
as
well
pass
the
night
under
my
own
roof
as
in
an
inn
besides
i
could
spare
a
day
easily
to
arrange
matters
with
my
landlord
and
thus
save
myself
the
trouble
of
invading
the
neighbourhood
again
having
rested
awhile
i
directed
my
servant
to
inquire
the
way
to
the
village
and
with
great
fatigue
to
our
beasts
we
managed
the
distance
in
some
three
hours
i
left
him
there
and
proceeded
down
the
valley
alone
the
grey
church
looked
greyer
and
the
lonely
churchyard
lonelier
i
distinguished
a
cropping
the
short
turf
on
the
graves
it
was
sweet
warm
weather
too
warm
for
travelling
but
the
heat
did
not
hinder
me
from
enjoying
the
delightful
scenery
above
and
below
had
i
seen
it
nearer
august
i
sure
it
would
have
tempted
me
to
waste
a
month
among
its
solitudes
in
winter
nothing
more
dreary
in
summer
nothing
more
divine
than
those
glens
shut
in
by
hills
and
those
bluff
bold
swells
of
heath
i
reached
the
grange
before
sunset
and
knocked
for
admittance
but
the
family
had
retreated
into
the
back
premises
i
judged
by
one
thin
blue
wreath
curling
from
the
kitchen
chimney
and
they
did
not
hear
i
rode
into
the
court
under
the
porch
a
girl
of
nine
or
ten
sat
knitting
and
an
old
woman
reclined
on
the
housesteps
smoking
a
meditative
pipe
dean
within
i
demanded
of
the
dame
dean
nay
she
answered
does

shoo
up
at
th
heights
you
the
housekeeper
then
i
continued
aw

hause
she
replied
i

master

rooms

i
wonder

she
cried
in
astonishment
whoiver
knew
yah
wur
coming
yah
sud
ha
send
word
they
nowt
norther
dry
nor
mensful
abaht
t
place
nowt
there
is
she
threw
down
her
pipe
and
bustled
in
the
girl
followed
and
i
entered
too
soon
perceiving
that
her
report
was
true
and
moreover
that
i
had
almost
upset
her
wits
by
my
unwelcome
apparition
i
bade
her
be
composed
i
would
go
out
for
a
walk
and
meantime
she
must
try
to
prepare
a
corner
of
a
for
me
to
sup
in
and
a
bedroom
to
sleep
in
no
sweeping
and
dusting
only
good
fire
and
dry
sheets
were
necessary
she
seemed
willing
to
do
her
best
though
she
thrust
the
into
the
grates
in
mistake
for
the
poker
and
malappropriated
several
other
articles
of
her
craft
but
i
retired
confiding
in
her
energy
for
a
against
my
return
wuthering
heights
was
the
goal
of
my
proposed
excursion
an
afterthought
brought
me
back
when
i
had
quitted
the
court
well
at
the
heights
i
inquired
of
the
woman
owt
ee
knaw
she
answered
skurrying
away
with
a
pan
of
hot
cinders
i
would
have
asked
why
dean
had
deserted
the
grange
but
it
was
impossible
to
delay
her
at
such
a
crisis
so
i
turned
away
and
made
my
exit
rambling
leisurely
along
with
the
glow
of
a
sinking
sun
behind
and
the
mild
glory
of
a
rising
moon
in
front
one
fading
and
the
other
brightening
as
i
quitted
the
park
and
climbed
the
stony
branching
off
to
heathcliff
dwelling
before
i
arrived
in
sight
of
it
all
that
remained
of
day
was
a
beamless
amber
light
along
the
west
but
i
could
see
every
pebble
on
the
path
and
every
blade
of
grass
by
that
splendid
moon
i
had
neither
to
climb
the
gate
nor
to
knock
it
yielded
to
my
hand
that
is
an
improvement
i
thought
and
i
noticed
another
by
the
aid
of
my
nostrils
a
fragrance
of
stocks
and
wallflowers
wafted
on
the
air
from
amongst
the
homely
both
doors
and
lattices
were
open
and
yet
as
is
usually
the
case
in
a
a
fine
red
fire
illumined
the
chimney
the
comfort
which
the
eye
derives
from
it
renders
the
extra
heat
endurable
but
the
house
of
wuthering
heights
is
so
large
that
the
inmates
have
plenty
of
space
for
withdrawing
out
of
its
influence
and
accordingly
what
inmates
there
were
had
stationed
themselves
not
far
from
one
of
the
windows
i
could
both
see
them
and
hear
them
talk
before
i
entered
and
looked
and
listened
in
consequence
being
moved
thereto
by
a
mingled
sense
of
curiosity
and
envy
that
grew
as
i
lingered
said
a
voice
as
sweet
as
a
silver
bell
for
the
third
time
you
dunce
i
not
going
to
tell
you
again
recollect
or
i
pull
your
hair
then
answered
another
in
deep
but
softened
tones
now
kiss
me
for
minding
so
well
read
it
over
first
correctly
without
a
single
mistake
the
male
speaker
began
to
read
he
was
a
young
man
respectably
dressed
and
seated
at
a
table
having
a
book
before
him
his
handsome
features
glowed
with
pleasure
and
his
eyes
kept
impatiently
wandering
from
the
page
to
a
small
white
hand
over
his
shoulder
which
recalled
him
by
a
smart
slap
on
the
cheek
whenever
its
owner
detected
such
signs
of
inattention
its
owner
stood
behind
her
light
shining
ringlets
blending
at
intervals
with
his
brown
looks
as
she
bent
to
superintend
his
studies
and
her
face
it
was
lucky
he
could
not
see
her
face
or
he
would
never
have
been
so
steady
i
could
and
i
bit
my
lip
in
spite
at
having
thrown
away
the
chance
i
might
have
had
of
doing
something
besides
staring
at
its
smiting
beauty
the
task
was
done
not
free
from
further
blunders
but
the
pupil
claimed
a
reward
and
received
at
least
five
kisses
which
however
he
generously
returned
then
they
came
to
the
door
and
from
their
conversation
i
judged
they
were
about
to
issue
out
and
have
a
walk
on
the
moors
i
supposed
i
should
be
condemned
in
hareton
earnshaw
heart
if
not
by
his
mouth
to
the
lowest
pit
in
the
infernal
regions
if
i
showed
my
unfortunate
person
in
his
neighbourhood
then
and
feeling
very
mean
and
malignant
i
skulked
round
to
seek
refuge
in
the
kitchen
there
was
unobstructed
admittance
on
that
side
also
and
at
the
door
sat
my
old
friend
nelly
dean
sewing
and
singing
a
song
which
was
often
interrupted
from
within
by
harsh
words
of
scorn
and
intolerance
uttered
in
far
from
musical
accents
rayther
by
th
haulf
hev
swearing
i
my
lugs
morn
to
neeght
nor
hearken
ye
hahsiver
said
the
tenant
of
the
kitchen
in
answer
to
an
unheard
speech
of
nelly
a
blazing
shame
that
i
can
not
oppen
t
blessed
book
but
yah
set
up
them
glories
to
sattan
and
all
t
flaysome
wickednesses
that

warld
oh

he
added
with
a
groan
witched
i
sartin
o

nor

rullers
or
we
should
be
sitting
in
flaming
fagots
i
suppose
retorted
the
singer
wisht
old
man
and
read
your
bible
like
a
christian
and
never
mind
me
this
is
fairy
annie
wedding
a
bonny
tune
it
goes
to
a
dance
dean
was
about
to
recommence
when
i
advanced
and
recognising
me
directly
she
jumped
to
her
feet
crying
bless
you
lockwood
how
could
you
think
of
returning
in
this
way
all
shut
up
at
thrushcross
grange
you
should
have
given
us
notice
arranged
to
be
accommodated
there
for
as
long
as
i
shall
stay
i
answered
depart
again
and
how
are
you
transplanted
here
dean
tell
me
that
left
and
heathcliff
wished
me
to
come
soon
after
you
went
to
london
and
stay
till
you
returned
but
step
in
pray
have
you
walked
from
gimmerton
this
evening
the
grange
i
replied
while
they
make
me
lodging
room
there
i
want
to
finish
my
business
with
your
master
because
i
do
think
of
having
another
opportunity
in
a
hurry
business
sir
said
nelly
conducting
me
into
the
house
gone
out
at
present
and
wo
return
soon
the
rent
i
answered
then
it
is
with
heathcliff
you
must
settle
she
observed
rather
with
me
she
has
not
learnt
to
manage
her
affairs
yet
and
i
act
for
her
there
nobody
else
i
looked
surprised
you
have
not
heard
of
heathcliff
death
i
see
she
continued
dead
i
exclaimed
astonished
long
ago
months
since
but
sit
down
and
let
me
take
your
hat
and
tell
you
all
about
it
stop
you
have
had
nothing
to
eat
have
you
want
nothing
i
have
ordered
supper
at
home
you
sit
down
too
i
never
dreamt
of
his
dying
let
me
hear
how
it
came
to
pass
you
say
you
do
expect
them
back
for
some
time
the
young
people
i
have
to
scold
them
every
evening
for
their
late
rambles
but
they
do
care
for
me
at
least
have
a
drink
of
our
old
ale
it
will
do
you
good
you
seem
weary
she
hastened
to
fetch
it
before
i
could
refuse
and
i
heard
joseph
asking
whether
war
a
crying
scandal
that
she
should
have
followers
at
her
time
of
life
and
then
to
get
them
jocks
out
o
t
maister
cellar
he
fair
shaamed
to
still
and
see
it
she
did
not
stay
to
retaliate
but
in
a
minute
bearing
a
reaming
silver
pint
whose
contents
i
lauded
with
becoming
earnestness
and
afterwards
she
furnished
me
with
the
sequel
of
heathcliff
history
he
had
a
end
as
she
expressed
it
i
was
summoned
to
wuthering
heights
within
a
fortnight
of
your
leaving
us
she
said
and
i
obeyed
joyfully
for
catherine
sake
my
first
interview
with
her
grieved
and
shocked
me
she
had
altered
so
much
since
our
separation
heathcliff
did
not
explain
his
reasons
for
taking
a
new
mind
about
my
coming
here
he
only
told
me
he
wanted
me
and
he
was
tired
of
seeing
catherine
i
must
make
the
little
parlour
my
and
keep
her
with
me
it
was
enough
if
he
were
obliged
to
see
her
once
or
twice
a
day
she
seemed
pleased
at
this
arrangement
and
by
degrees
i
smuggled
over
a
great
number
of
books
and
other
articles
that
had
formed
her
amusement
at
the
grange
and
flattered
myself
we
should
get
on
in
tolerable
comfort
the
delusion
did
not
last
long
catherine
contented
at
first
in
a
brief
space
grew
irritable
and
restless
for
one
thing
she
was
forbidden
to
move
out
of
the
garden
and
it
fretted
her
sadly
to
be
confined
to
its
narrow
bounds
as
spring
drew
on
for
another
in
following
the
house
i
was
forced
to
quit
her
frequently
and
she
complained
of
loneliness
she
preferred
quarrelling
with
joseph
in
the
kitchen
to
sitting
at
peace
in
her
solitude
i
did
not
mind
their
skirmishes
but
hareton
was
often
obliged
to
seek
the
kitchen
also
when
the
master
wanted
to
have
the
house
to
himself
and
though
in
the
beginning
she
either
left
it
at
his
approach
or
quietly
joined
in
my
occupations
and
shunned
remarking
or
addressing
him
and
though
he
was
always
as
sullen
and
silent
as
possible
after
a
while
she
changed
her
behaviour
and
became
incapable
of
letting
him
alone
talking
at
him
commenting
on
his
stupidity
and
idleness
expressing
her
wonder
how
he
could
endure
the
life
he
lived
how
he
could
sit
a
whole
evening
staring
into
the
fire
and
dozing
just
like
a
dog
is
he
not
ellen
she
once
observed
a
he
does
his
work
eats
his
food
and
sleeps
eternally
what
a
blank
dreary
mind
he
must
have
do
you
ever
dream
hareton
and
if
you
do
what
is
it
about
but
you
ca
speak
to
me
then
she
looked
at
him
but
he
would
neither
open
his
mouth
nor
look
again
perhaps
dreaming
now
she
continued
twitched
his
shoulder
as
juno
twitches
hers
ask
him
ellen
hareton
will
ask
the
master
to
send
you
if
you
behave
i
said
he
had
not
only
twitched
his
shoulder
but
clenched
his
fist
as
if
tempted
to
use
it
know
why
hareton
never
speaks
when
i
am
in
the
kitchen
she
exclaimed
on
another
occasion
is
afraid
i
shall
laugh
at
him
ellen
what
do
you
think
he
began
to
teach
himself
to
read
once
and
because
i
laughed
he
burned
his
books
and
dropped
it
was
he
not
a
fool
not
you
naughty
i
said
me
that
i
was
she
went
on
i
did
not
expect
him
to
be
so
silly
hareton
if
i
gave
you
a
book
would
you
take
it
now
i
try
she
placed
one
she
had
been
perusing
on
his
hand
he
flung
it
off
and
muttered
if
she
did
not
give
over
he
would
break
her
neck
i
shall
put
it
here
she
said
the
and
going
to
bed
then
she
whispered
me
to
watch
whether
he
touched
it
and
departed
but
he
would
not
come
near
it
and
so
i
informed
her
in
the
morning
to
her
great
disappointment
i
saw
she
was
sorry
for
his
persevering
sulkiness
and
indolence
her
conscience
reproved
her
for
frightening
him
off
improving
himself
she
had
done
it
effectually
but
her
ingenuity
was
at
work
to
remedy
the
injury
while
i
ironed
or
pursued
other
such
stationary
employments
as
i
could
not
well
do
in
the
parlour
she
would
bring
some
pleasant
volume
and
read
it
aloud
to
me
when
hareton
was
there
she
generally
paused
in
an
interesting
part
and
left
the
book
lying
about
that
she
did
repeatedly
but
he
was
as
obstinate
as
a
mule
and
instead
of
snatching
at
her
bait
in
wet
weather
he
took
to
smoking
with
joseph
and
they
sat
like
automatons
one
on
each
side
of
the
fire
the
elder
happily
too
deaf
to
understand
her
wicked
nonsense
as
he
would
have
called
it
the
younger
doing
his
best
to
seem
to
disregard
it
on
fine
evenings
the
latter
followed
his
shooting
expeditions
and
catherine
yawned
and
sighed
and
teased
me
to
talk
to
her
and
ran
off
into
the
court
or
garden
the
moment
i
began
and
as
a
last
resource
cried
and
said
she
was
tired
of
living
her
life
was
useless
heathcliff
who
grew
more
and
more
disinclined
to
society
had
almost
banished
earnshaw
from
his
apartment
owing
to
an
accident
at
the
commencement
of
march
he
became
for
some
days
a
fixture
in
the
kitchen
his
gun
burst
while
out
on
the
hills
by
himself
a
splinter
cut
his
arm
and
he
lost
a
good
deal
of
blood
before
he
could
reach
home
the
consequence
was
that
perforce
he
was
condemned
to
the
fireside
and
tranquillity
till
he
made
it
up
again
it
suited
catherine
to
have
him
there
at
any
rate
it
made
her
hate
her
room
more
than
ever
and
she
would
compel
me
to
find
out
business
below
that
she
might
accompany
me
on
easter
monday
joseph
went
to
gimmerton
fair
with
some
cattle
and
in
the
afternoon
i
was
busy
getting
up
linen
in
the
kitchen
earnshaw
sat
morose
as
usual
at
the
chimney
corner
and
my
little
mistress
was
beguiling
an
idle
hour
with
drawing
pictures
on
the
varying
her
amusement
by
smothered
bursts
of
songs
and
whispered
ejaculations
and
quick
glances
of
annoyance
and
impatience
in
the
direction
of
her
cousin
who
steadfastly
smoked
and
looked
into
the
grate
at
a
notice
that
i
could
do
with
her
no
longer
intercepting
my
light
she
removed
to
the
hearthstone
i
bestowed
little
attention
on
her
proceedings
but
presently
i
heard
her
begin
found
out
hareton
that
i
want
that
i
glad
that
i
should
like
you
to
be
my
cousin
now
if
you
had
not
grown
so
cross
to
me
and
so
rough
hareton
returned
no
answer
hareton
hareton
do
you
hear
she
continued
off
wi
ye
he
growled
with
uncompromising
gruffness
me
take
that
pipe
she
said
cautiously
advancing
her
hand
and
abstracting
it
from
his
mouth
before
he
could
attempt
to
recover
it
it
was
broken
and
behind
the
fire
he
swore
at
her
and
seized
another
she
cried
must
listen
to
me
first
and
i
ca
speak
while
those
clouds
are
floating
in
my
face
you
go
to
the
devil
he
exclaimed
ferociously
let
me
be
she
persisted
wo
i
ca
tell
what
to
do
to
make
you
talk
to
me
and
you
are
determined
not
to
understand
when
i
call
you
stupid
i
do
mean
anything
i
do
mean
that
i
despise
you
come
you
shall
take
notice
of
me
hareton
you
are
my
cousin
and
you
shall
own
me
shall
have
naught
to
do
wi
you
and
your
mucky
pride
and
your
damned
mocking
tricks
he
answered
go
to
hell
body
and
soul
before
i
look
sideways
after
you
again
side
out
o
t
gate
now
this
minute
catherine
frowned
and
retreated
to
the
chewing
her
lip
and
endeavouring
by
humming
an
eccentric
tune
to
conceal
a
growing
tendency
to
sob
should
be
friends
with
your
cousin
hareton
i
interrupted
she
repents
of
her
sauciness
it
would
do
you
a
great
deal
of
good
it
would
make
you
another
man
to
have
her
for
a
companion
companion
he
cried
she
hates
me
and
does
not
think
me
fit
to
wipe
her
shoon
nay
if
it
made
me
a
king
i
not
be
scorned
for
seeking
her
any
more
is
not
i
who
hate
you
it
is
you
who
hate
me
wept
cathy
no
longer
disguising
her
trouble
hate
me
as
much
as
heathcliff
does
and
more
a
damned
liar
began
earnshaw
have
i
made
him
angry
by
taking
your
part
then
a
hundred
times
and
that
when
you
sneered
at
and
despised
me
and
go
on
plaguing
me
and
i
step
in
yonder
and
say
you
worried
me
out
of
the
kitchen
did
know
you
took
my
part
she
answered
drying
her
eyes
i
was
miserable
and
bitter
at
everybody
but
now
i
thank
you
and
beg
you
to
forgive
me
what
can
i
do
besides
she
returned
to
the
hearth
and
frankly
extended
her
hand
he
blackened
and
scowled
like
a
and
kept
his
fists
resolutely
clenched
and
his
gaze
fixed
on
the
ground
catherine
by
instinct
must
have
divined
it
was
obdurate
perversity
and
not
dislike
that
prompted
this
dogged
conduct
for
after
remaining
an
instant
undecided
she
stooped
and
impressed
on
his
cheek
a
gentle
kiss
the
little
rogue
thought
i
had
not
seen
her
and
drawing
back
she
took
her
former
station
by
the
window
quite
demurely
i
shook
my
head
reprovingly
and
then
she
blushed
and
whispered
what
should
i
have
done
ellen
he
would
shake
hands
and
he
would
look
i
must
show
him
some
way
that
i
like
him
that
i
want
to
be
friends
whether
the
kiss
convinced
hareton
i
can
not
tell
he
was
very
careful
for
some
minutes
that
his
face
should
not
be
seen
and
when
he
did
raise
it
he
was
sadly
puzzled
where
to
turn
his
eyes
catherine
employed
herself
in
wrapping
a
handsome
book
neatly
in
white
paper
and
having
tied
it
with
a
bit
of
ribbon
and
addressed
it
to
hareton
earnshaw
she
desired
me
to
be
her
ambassadress
and
convey
the
present
to
its
destined
recipient
tell
him
if
he
take
it
i
come
and
teach
him
to
read
it
right
she
said
if
he
refuse
it
i
go
upstairs
and
never
tease
him
again
i
carried
it
and
repeated
the
message
anxiously
watched
by
my
employer
hareton
would
not
open
his
fingers
so
i
laid
it
on
his
knee
he
did
not
strike
it
off
either
i
returned
to
my
work
catherine
leaned
her
head
and
arms
on
the
table
till
she
heard
the
slight
rustle
of
the
covering
being
removed
then
she
stole
away
and
quietly
seated
herself
beside
her
cousin
he
trembled
and
his
face
glowed
all
his
rudeness
and
all
his
surly
harshness
had
deserted
him
he
could
not
summon
courage
at
first
to
utter
a
syllable
in
reply
to
her
questioning
look
and
her
murmured
petition
you
forgive
me
hareton
do
you
can
make
me
so
happy
by
speaking
that
little
word
he
muttered
something
inaudible
you
be
my
friend
added
catherine
interrogatively
you
be
ashamed
of
me
every
day
of
your
life
he
answered
the
more
ashamed
the
more
you
know
me
and
i
can
not
bide
it
you
wo
be
my
friend
she
said
smiling
as
sweet
as
honey
and
creeping
close
up
i
overheard
no
further
distinguishable
talk
but
on
looking
round
again
i
perceived
two
such
radiant
countenances
bent
over
the
page
of
the
accepted
book
that
i
did
not
doubt
the
treaty
had
been
ratified
on
both
sides
and
the
enemies
were
thenceforth
sworn
allies
the
work
they
studied
was
full
of
costly
pictures
and
those
and
their
position
had
charm
enough
to
keep
them
unmoved
till
joseph
came
home
he
poor
man
was
perfectly
aghast
at
the
spectacle
of
catherine
seated
on
the
same
bench
with
hareton
earnshaw
leaning
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
confounded
at
his
favourite
endurance
of
her
proximity
it
affected
him
too
deeply
to
allow
an
observation
on
the
subject
that
night
his
emotion
was
only
revealed
by
the
immense
sighs
he
drew
as
he
solemnly
spread
his
large
bible
on
the
table
and
overlaid
it
with
dirty
from
his
the
produce
of
the
day
transactions
at
length
he
summoned
hareton
from
his
seat
these
in
to
t
maister
lad
he
said
bide
there
i
gang
up
to
my
own
rahm
this
hoile
neither
mensful
nor
seemly
for
us
we
mun
side
out
and
seearch
another
catherine
i
said
must
side
out
too
i
done
my
ironing
are
you
ready
to
go

not

she
answered
rising
unwillingly
i
leave
this
book
upon
the
and
i
bring
some
more
books
that
yah
leave
i
shall
tak
into
th
hahse
said
joseph
it
be
mitch
if
yah
find
agean
soa
yah
may
plase
yerseln
cathy
threatened
that
his
library
should
pay
for
hers
and
smiling
as
she
passed
hareton
went
singing
lighter
of
heart
i
venture
to
say
than
ever
she
had
been
under
that
roof
before
except
perhaps
during
her
earliest
visits
to
linton
the
intimacy
thus
commenced
grew
rapidly
though
it
encountered
temporary
interruptions
earnshaw
was
not
to
be
civilized
with
a
wish
and
my
young
lady
was
no
philosopher
and
no
paragon
of
patience
but
both
their
minds
tending
to
the
same
point
one
loving
and
desiring
to
esteem
and
the
other
loving
and
desiring
to
be
esteemed
they
contrived
in
the
end
to
reach
it
you
see
lockwood
it
was
easy
enough
to
win
heathcliff
heart
but
now
i
glad
you
did
not
try
the
crown
of
all
my
wishes
will
be
the
union
of
those
two
i
shall
envy
no
one
on
their
wedding
day
there
wo
be
a
happier
woman
than
myself
in
england
chapter
xxxiii
on
the
morrow
of
that
monday
earnshaw
being
still
unable
to
follow
his
ordinary
employments
and
therefore
remaining
about
the
house
i
speedily
found
it
would
be
impracticable
to
retain
my
charge
beside
me
as
heretofore
she
got
downstairs
before
me
and
out
into
the
garden
where
she
had
seen
her
cousin
performing
some
easy
work
and
when
i
went
to
bid
them
come
to
breakfast
i
saw
she
had
persuaded
him
to
clear
a
large
space
of
ground
from
currant
and
gooseberry
bushes
and
they
were
busy
planning
together
an
importation
of
plants
from
the
grange
i
was
terrified
at
the
devastation
which
had
been
accomplished
in
a
brief
the
trees
were
the
apple
of
joseph
eye
and
she
had
just
fixed
her
choice
of
a
in
the
midst
of
them
that
will
be
all
shown
to
the
master
i
exclaimed
minute
it
is
discovered
and
what
excuse
have
you
to
offer
for
taking
such
liberties
with
the
garden
we
shall
have
a
fine
explosion
on
the
head
of
it
see
if
we
do
hareton
i
wonder
you
should
have
no
more
wit
than
to
go
and
make
that
mess
at
her
bidding
forgotten
they
were
joseph
answered
earnshaw
rather
puzzled
i
tell
him
i
did
it
we
always
ate
our
meals
with
heathcliff
i
held
the
mistress
post
in
making
tea
and
carving
so
i
was
indispensable
at
table
catherine
usually
sat
by
me
but
she
stole
nearer
to
hareton
and
i
presently
saw
she
would
have
no
more
discretion
in
her
friendship
than
she
had
in
her
hostility
mind
you
do
talk
with
and
notice
your
cousin
too
much
were
my
whispered
instructions
as
we
entered
the
room
will
certainly
annoy
heathcliff
and
he
be
mad
at
you
both
not
going
to
she
answered
the
minute
after
she
had
sidled
to
him
and
was
sticking
primroses
in
his
plate
of
porridge
he
dared
not
speak
to
her
there
he
dared
hardly
look
and
yet
she
went
on
teasing
till
he
was
twice
on
the
point
of
being
provoked
to
laugh
i
frowned
and
then
she
glanced
towards
the
master
whose
mind
was
occupied
on
other
subjects
than
his
company
as
his
countenance
evinced
and
she
grew
serious
for
an
instant
scrutinizing
him
with
deep
gravity
afterwards
she
turned
and
recommenced
her
nonsense
at
last
hareton
uttered
a
smothered
laugh
heathcliff
started
his
eye
rapidly
surveyed
our
faces
catherine
met
it
with
her
accustomed
look
of
nervousness
and
yet
defiance
which
he
abhorred
is
well
you
are
out
of
my
reach
he
exclaimed
fiend
possesses
you
to
stare
back
at
me
continually
with
those
infernal
eyes
down
with
them
and
do
remind
me
of
your
existence
again
i
thought
i
had
cured
you
of
laughing
was
me
muttered
hareton
do
you
say
demanded
the
master
hareton
looked
at
his
plate
and
did
not
repeat
the
confession
heathcliff
looked
at
him
a
bit
and
then
silently
resumed
his
breakfast
and
his
interrupted
musing
we
had
nearly
finished
and
the
two
young
people
prudently
shifted
wider
asunder
so
i
anticipated
no
further
disturbance
during
that
sitting
when
joseph
appeared
at
the
door
revealing
by
his
quivering
lip
and
furious
eyes
that
the
outrage
committed
on
his
precious
shrubs
was
detected
he
must
have
seen
cathy
and
her
cousin
about
the
spot
before
he
examined
it
for
while
his
jaws
worked
like
those
of
a
cow
chewing
its
cud
and
rendered
his
speech
difficult
to
understand
he
began
mun
hev
my
wage
and
i

aimed
to

and
made
on
him
and
goan
and
riven
up
a
whole
row
o
t
grandest
i
t
garden
and
here
he
lamented
outright
unmanned
by
a
sense
of
his
bitter
injuries
and
earnshaw
ingratitude
and
dangerous
condition
the
fool
drunk
asked
heathcliff
is
it
you
finding
fault
with
pulled
up
two
or
three
bushes
replied
the
young
man
going
to
set
again
why
have
you
pulled
them
up
said
the
master
catherine
wisely
put
in
her
tongue
wanted
to
plant
some
flowers
there
she
cried
the
only
person
to
blame
for
i
wished
him
to
do
it
who
the
devil
gave
leave
to
touch
a
stick
about
the
place
demanded
her
much
surprised
who
ordered
to
obey
her
he
added
turning
to
hareton
the
latter
was
speechless
his
cousin
replied
should
grudge
a
few
yards
of
earth
for
me
to
ornament
when
you
have
taken
all
my
land
land
insolent
slut
you
never
had
any
said
heathcliff
my
money
she
continued
returning
his
angry
glare
and
meantime
biting
a
piece
of
crust
the
remnant
of
her
breakfast
he
exclaimed
done
and
begone
hareton
land
and
his
money
pursued
the
reckless
thing
and
i
are
friends
now
and
i
shall
tell
him
all
about
you
the
master
seemed
confounded
a
moment
he
grew
pale
and
rose
up
eyeing
her
all
the
while
with
an
expression
of
mortal
hate
you
strike
me
hareton
will
strike
you
she
said
you
may
as
well
sit
down
hareton
does
not
turn
you
out
of
the
room
i
strike
him
to
hell
thundered
heathcliff
witch
dare
you
pretend
to
rouse
him
against
me
off
with
her
do
you
hear
fling
her
into
the
kitchen
i
kill
her
ellen
dean
if
you
let
her
come
into
my
sight
again
hareton
tried
under
his
breath
to
persuade
her
to
go
her
away
he
cried
savagely
you
staying
to
talk
and
he
approached
to
execute
his
own
command
not
obey
you
wicked
man
any
more
said
catherine
soon
detest
you
as
much
as
i
do
wisht
muttered
the
young
man
reproachfully
will
not
hear
you
speak
so
to
him
have
done
you
wo
let
him
strike
me
she
cried
then
he
whispered
earnestly
it
was
too
late
heathcliff
had
caught
hold
of
her
go
he
said
to
earnshaw
witch
this
time
she
has
provoked
me
when
i
could
not
bear
it
and
i
make
her
repent
it
for
ever
he
had
his
hand
in
her
hair
hareton
attempted
to
release
her
locks
entreating
him
not
to
hurt
her
that
once
heathcliff
black
eyes
flashed
he
seemed
ready
to
tear
catherine
in
pieces
and
i
was
just
worked
up
to
risk
coming
to
the
rescue
when
of
a
sudden
his
fingers
relaxed
he
shifted
his
grasp
from
her
head
to
her
arm
and
gazed
intently
in
her
face
then
he
drew
his
hand
over
his
eyes
stood
a
moment
to
collect
himself
apparently
and
turning
anew
to
catherine
said
with
assumed
calmness
must
learn
to
avoid
putting
me
in
a
passion
or
i
shall
really
murder
you
some
time
go
with
dean
and
keep
with
her
and
confine
your
insolence
to
her
ears
as
to
hareton
earnshaw
if
i
see
him
listen
to
you
i
send
him
seeking
his
bread
where
he
can
get
it
your
love
will
make
him
an
outcast
and
a
beggar
nelly
take
her
and
leave
me
all
of
you
leave
me
i
led
my
young
lady
out
she
was
too
glad
of
her
escape
to
resist
the
other
followed
and
heathcliff
had
the
room
to
himself
till
dinner
i
had
counselled
catherine
to
dine
but
as
soon
as
he
perceived
her
vacant
seat
he
sent
me
to
call
her
he
spoke
to
none
of
us
ate
very
little
and
went
out
directly
afterwards
intimating
that
he
should
not
return
before
evening
the
two
new
friends
established
themselves
in
the
house
during
his
absence
where
i
heard
hareton
sternly
check
his
cousin
on
her
offering
a
revelation
of
her
conduct
to
his
father
he
said
he
would
suffer
a
word
to
be
uttered
in
his
disparagement
if
he
were
the
devil
it
did
signify
he
would
stand
by
him
and
he
rather
she
would
abuse
himself
as
she
used
to
than
begin
on
heathcliff
catherine
was
waxing
cross
at
this
but
he
found
means
to
make
her
hold
her
tongue
by
asking
how
she
would
like
to
speak
ill
of
her
father
then
she
comprehended
that
earnshaw
took
the
master
reputation
home
to
himself
and
was
attached
by
ties
stronger
than
reason
could
break
chains
forged
by
habit
which
it
would
be
cruel
to
attempt
to
loosen
she
showed
a
good
heart
thenceforth
in
avoiding
both
complaints
and
expressions
of
antipathy
concerning
heathcliff
and
confessed
to
me
her
sorrow
that
she
had
endeavoured
to
raise
a
bad
spirit
between
him
and
hareton
indeed
i
do
believe
she
has
ever
breathed
a
syllable
in
the
latter
hearing
against
her
oppressor
since
when
this
slight
disagreement
was
over
they
were
friends
again
and
as
busy
as
possible
in
their
several
occupations
of
pupil
and
teacher
i
came
in
to
sit
with
them
after
i
had
done
my
work
and
i
felt
so
soothed
and
comforted
to
watch
them
that
i
did
not
notice
how
time
got
on
you
know
they
both
appeared
in
a
measure
my
children
i
had
long
been
proud
of
one
and
now
i
was
sure
the
other
would
be
a
source
of
equal
satisfaction
his
honest
warm
and
intelligent
nature
shook
off
rapidly
the
clouds
of
ignorance
and
degradation
in
which
it
had
been
bred
and
catherine
sincere
commendations
acted
as
a
spur
to
his
industry
his
brightening
mind
brightened
his
features
and
added
spirit
and
nobility
to
their
aspect
i
could
hardly
fancy
it
the
same
individual
i
had
beheld
on
the
day
i
discovered
my
little
lady
at
wuthering
heights
after
her
expedition
to
the
crags
while
i
admired
and
they
laboured
dusk
drew
on
and
with
it
returned
the
master
he
came
upon
us
quite
unexpectedly
entering
by
the
front
way
and
had
a
full
view
of
the
whole
three
ere
we
could
raise
our
heads
to
glance
at
him
well
i
reflected
there
was
never
a
pleasanter
or
more
harmless
sight
and
it
will
be
a
burning
shame
to
scold
them
the
red
glowed
on
their
two
bonny
heads
and
revealed
their
faces
animated
with
the
eager
interest
of
children
for
though
he
was
and
she
eighteen
each
had
so
much
of
novelty
to
feel
and
learn
that
neither
experienced
nor
evinced
the
sentiments
of
sober
disenchanted
maturity
they
lifted
their
eyes
together
to
encounter
heathcliff
perhaps
you
have
never
remarked
that
their
eyes
are
precisely
similar
and
they
are
those
of
catherine
earnshaw
the
present
catherine
has
no
other
likeness
to
her
except
a
breadth
of
forehead
and
a
certain
arch
of
the
nostril
that
makes
her
appear
rather
haughty
whether
she
will
or
not
with
hareton
the
resemblance
is
carried
farther
it
is
singular
at
all
times
it
was
particularly
striking
because
his
senses
were
alert
and
his
mental
faculties
wakened
to
unwonted
activity
i
suppose
this
resemblance
disarmed
heathcliff
he
walked
to
the
hearth
in
evident
agitation
but
it
quickly
subsided
as
he
looked
at
the
young
man
or
i
should
say
altered
its
character
for
it
was
there
yet
he
took
the
book
from
his
hand
and
glanced
at
the
open
page
then
returned
it
without
any
observation
merely
signing
catherine
away
her
companion
lingered
very
little
behind
her
and
i
was
about
to
depart
also
but
he
bid
me
sit
still
is
a
poor
conclusion
is
it
not
he
observed
having
brooded
awhile
on
the
scene
he
had
just
witnessed
absurd
termination
to
my
violent
exertions
i
get
levers
and
mattocks
to
demolish
the
two
houses
and
train
myself
to
be
capable
of
working
like
hercules
and
when
everything
is
ready
and
in
my
power
i
find
the
will
to
lift
a
slate
off
either
roof
has
vanished
my
old
enemies
have
not
beaten
me
now
would
be
the
precise
time
to
revenge
myself
on
their
representatives
i
could
do
it
and
none
could
hinder
me
but
where
is
the
use
i
do
care
for
striking
i
ca
take
the
trouble
to
raise
my
hand
that
sounds
as
if
i
had
been
labouring
the
whole
time
only
to
exhibit
a
fine
trait
of
magnanimity
it
is
far
from
being
the
case
i
have
lost
the
faculty
of
enjoying
their
destruction
and
i
am
too
idle
to
destroy
for
nothing
there
is
a
strange
change
approaching
i
in
its
shadow
at
present
i
take
so
little
interest
in
my
daily
life
that
i
hardly
remember
to
eat
and
drink
those
two
who
have
left
the
room
are
the
only
objects
which
retain
a
distinct
material
appearance
to
me
and
that
appearance
causes
me
pain
amounting
to
agony
about
i
speak
and
i
do
desire
to
think
but
i
earnestly
wish
she
were
invisible
her
presence
invokes
only
maddening
sensations
moves
me
differently
and
yet
if
i
could
do
it
without
seeming
insane
i
never
see
him
again
you
perhaps
think
me
rather
inclined
to
become
so
he
added
making
an
effort
to
smile
i
try
to
describe
the
thousand
forms
of
past
associations
and
ideas
he
awakens
or
embodies
but
not
talk
of
what
i
tell
you
and
my
mind
is
so
eternally
secluded
in
itself
it
is
tempting
at
last
to
turn
it
out
to
another
minutes
ago
hareton
seemed
a
personification
of
my
youth
not
a
human
being
i
felt
to
him
in
such
a
variety
of
ways
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
have
accosted
him
rationally
in
the
first
place
his
startling
likeness
to
catherine
connected
him
fearfully
with
her
that
however
which
you
may
suppose
the
most
potent
to
arrest
my
imagination
is
actually
the
least
for
what
is
not
connected
with
her
to
me
and
what
does
not
recall
her
i
can
not
look
down
to
this
floor
but
her
features
are
shaped
in
the
flags
in
every
cloud
in
every
tree
filling
the
air
at
night
and
caught
by
glimpses
in
every
object
by
day
i
am
surrounded
with
her
image
the
most
ordinary
faces
of
men
and
women
my
own
features
mock
me
with
a
resemblance
the
entire
world
is
a
dreadful
collection
of
memoranda
that
she
did
exist
and
that
i
have
lost
her
well
hareton
aspect
was
the
ghost
of
my
immortal
love
of
my
wild
endeavours
to
hold
my
right
my
degradation
my
pride
my
happiness
and
my
anguish
it
is
frenzy
to
repeat
these
thoughts
to
you
only
it
will
let
you
know
why
with
a
reluctance
to
be
always
alone
his
society
is
no
benefit
rather
an
aggravation
of
the
constant
torment
i
suffer
and
it
partly
contributes
to
render
me
regardless
how
he
and
his
cousin
go
on
together
i
can
give
them
no
attention
any
more
what
do
you
mean
by
a
mr
heathcliff
i
said
alarmed
at
his
manner
though
he
was
neither
in
danger
of
losing
his
senses
nor
dying
according
to
my
judgment
he
was
quite
strong
and
healthy
and
as
to
his
reason
from
childhood
he
had
a
delight
in
dwelling
on
dark
things
and
entertaining
odd
fancies
he
might
have
had
a
monomania
on
the
subject
of
his
departed
idol
but
on
every
other
point
his
wits
were
as
sound
as
mine
shall
not
know
that
till
it
comes
he
said
only
half
conscious
of
it
now
have
no
feeling
of
illness
have
you
i
asked
nelly
i
have
not
he
answered
you
are
not
afraid
of
death
i
pursued
no
he
replied
have
neither
a
fear
nor
a
presentiment
nor
a
hope
of
death
why
should
i
with
my
hard
constitution
and
temperate
mode
of
living
and
unperilous
occupations
i
ought
to
and
probably
remain
above
ground
till
there
is
scarcely
a
black
hair
on
my
head
and
yet
i
can
not
continue
in
this
condition
i
have
to
remind
myself
to
breathe
almost
to
remind
my
heart
to
beat
and
it
is
like
bending
back
a
stiff
spring
it
is
by
compulsion
that
i
do
the
slightest
act
not
prompted
by
one
thought
and
by
compulsion
that
i
notice
anything
alive
or
dead
which
is
not
associated
with
one
universal
idea
i
have
a
single
wish
and
my
whole
being
and
faculties
are
yearning
to
attain
it
they
have
yearned
towards
it
so
long
and
so
unwaveringly
that
i
convinced
it
will
be
reached
and
soon
because
it
has
devoured
my
existence
i
am
swallowed
up
in
the
anticipation
of
its
fulfilment
my
confessions
have
not
relieved
me
but
they
may
account
for
some
otherwise
unaccountable
phases
of
humour
which
i
show
o
god
it
is
a
long
fight
i
wish
it
were
over
he
began
to
pace
the
room
muttering
terrible
things
to
himself
till
i
was
inclined
to
believe
as
he
said
joseph
did
that
conscience
had
turned
his
heart
to
an
earthly
hell
i
wondered
greatly
how
it
would
end
though
he
seldom
before
had
revealed
this
state
of
mind
even
by
looks
it
was
his
habitual
mood
i
had
no
doubt
he
asserted
it
himself
but
not
a
soul
from
his
general
bearing
would
have
conjectured
the
fact
you
did
not
when
you
saw
him
lockwood
and
at
the
period
of
which
i
speak
he
was
just
the
same
as
then
only
fonder
of
continued
solitude
and
perhaps
still
more
laconic
in
company
chapter
xxxiv
for
some
days
after
that
evening
heathcliff
shunned
meeting
us
at
meals
yet
he
would
not
consent
formally
to
exclude
hareton
and
cathy
he
had
an
aversion
to
yielding
so
completely
to
his
feelings
choosing
rather
to
absent
himself
and
eating
once
in
hours
seemed
sufficient
sustenance
for
him
one
night
after
the
family
were
in
bed
i
heard
him
go
downstairs
and
out
at
the
front
door
i
did
not
hear
him
and
in
the
morning
i
found
he
was
still
away
we
were
in
april
then
the
weather
was
sweet
and
warm
the
grass
as
green
as
showers
and
sun
could
make
it
and
the
two
dwarf
near
the
southern
wall
in
full
bloom
after
breakfast
catherine
insisted
on
my
bringing
a
chair
and
sitting
with
my
work
under
the
at
the
end
of
the
house
and
she
beguiled
hareton
who
had
perfectly
recovered
from
his
accident
to
dig
and
arrange
her
little
garden
which
was
shifted
to
that
corner
by
the
influence
of
joseph
complaints
i
was
comfortably
revelling
in
the
spring
fragrance
around
and
the
beautiful
soft
blue
overhead
when
my
young
lady
who
had
run
down
near
the
gate
to
procure
some
primrose
roots
for
a
border
returned
only
half
laden
and
informed
us
that
heathcliff
was
coming
in
he
spoke
to
me
she
added
with
a
perplexed
countenance
did
he
say
asked
hareton
told
me
to
begone
as
fast
as
i
could
she
answered
he
looked
so
different
from
his
usual
look
that
i
stopped
a
moment
to
stare
at
him
he
inquired
almost
bright
and
cheerful
no
nothing
excited
and
wild
and
glad
she
replied
amuses
him
then
i
remarked
affecting
a
careless
manner
in
reality
as
surprised
as
she
was
and
anxious
to
ascertain
the
truth
of
her
statement
for
to
see
the
master
looking
glad
would
not
be
an
spectacle
i
framed
an
excuse
to
go
in
heathcliff
stood
at
the
open
door
he
was
pale
and
he
trembled
yet
certainly
he
had
a
strange
joyful
glitter
in
his
eyes
that
altered
the
aspect
of
his
whole
face
you
have
some
breakfast
i
said
must
be
hungry
rambling
about
all
night
i
wanted
to
discover
where
he
had
been
but
i
did
not
like
to
ask
directly
i
not
hungry
he
answered
averting
his
head
and
speaking
rather
contemptuously
as
if
he
guessed
i
was
trying
to
divine
the
occasion
of
his
good
humour
i
felt
perplexed
i
did
know
whether
it
were
not
a
proper
opportunity
to
offer
a
bit
of
admonition
do
think
it
right
to
wander
out
of
doors
i
observed
of
being
in
bed
it
is
not
wise
at
any
rate
this
moist
season
i
daresay
you
catch
a
bad
cold
or
a
fever
you
have
something
the
matter
with
you
now
but
what
i
can
bear
he
replied
with
the
greatest
pleasure
provided
you
leave
me
alone
get
in
and
do
annoy
me
i
obeyed
and
in
passing
i
noticed
he
breathed
as
fast
as
a
cat
i
reflected
to
myself
shall
have
a
fit
of
illness
i
can
not
conceive
what
he
has
been
doing
that
noon
he
sat
down
to
dinner
with
us
and
received
a
plate
from
my
hands
as
if
he
intended
to
make
amends
for
previous
fasting
neither
cold
nor
fever
nelly
he
remarked
in
allusion
to
my
morning
speech
i
ready
to
do
justice
to
the
food
you
give
me
he
took
his
knife
and
fork
and
was
going
to
commence
eating
when
the
inclination
appeared
to
become
suddenly
extinct
he
laid
them
on
the
table
looked
eagerly
towards
the
window
then
rose
and
went
out
we
saw
him
walking
to
and
fro
in
the
garden
while
we
concluded
our
meal
and
earnshaw
said
he
go
and
ask
why
he
would
not
dine
he
thought
we
had
grieved
him
some
way
is
he
coming
cried
catherine
when
her
cousin
returned
he
answered
he
not
angry
he
seemed
rarely
pleased
indeed
only
i
made
him
impatient
by
speaking
to
him
twice
and
then
he
bid
me
be
off
to
you
he
wondered
how
i
could
want
the
company
of
anybody
else
i
set
his
plate
to
keep
warm
on
the
fender
and
after
an
hour
or
two
he
when
the
room
was
clear
in
no
degree
calmer
the
same
unnatural
it
was
unnatural
appearance
of
joy
under
his
black
brows
the
same
bloodless
hue
and
his
teeth
visible
now
and
then
in
a
kind
of
smile
his
frame
shivering
not
as
one
shivers
with
chill
or
weakness
but
as
a
cord
vibrates
a
strong
thrilling
rather
than
trembling
i
will
ask
what
is
the
matter
i
thought
or
who
should
and
i
exclaimed
you
heard
any
good
news
heathcliff
you
look
uncommonly
animated
should
good
news
come
from
to
me
he
said
animated
with
hunger
and
seemingly
i
must
not
eat
dinner
is
here
i
returned
wo
you
get
it
do
want
it
now
he
muttered
hastily
wait
till
supper
and
nelly
once
for
all
let
me
beg
you
to
warn
hareton
and
the
other
away
from
me
i
wish
to
be
troubled
by
nobody
i
wish
to
have
this
place
to
myself
there
some
new
reason
for
this
banishment
i
inquired
me
why
you
are
so
queer
heathcliff
where
were
you
last
night
i
not
putting
the
question
through
idle
curiosity
but
are
putting
the
question
through
very
idle
curiosity
he
interrupted
with
a
laugh
i
answer
it
last
night
i
was
on
the
threshold
of
hell
i
am
within
sight
of
my
heaven
i
have
my
eyes
on
it
hardly
three
feet
to
sever
me
and
now
you
better
go
you
neither
see
nor
hear
anything
to
frighten
you
if
you
refrain
from
prying
having
swept
the
hearth
and
wiped
the
table
i
departed
more
perplexed
than
ever
he
did
not
quit
the
house
again
that
afternoon
and
no
one
intruded
on
his
solitude
till
at
eight
i
deemed
it
proper
though
unsummoned
to
carry
a
candle
and
his
supper
to
him
he
was
leaning
against
the
ledge
of
an
open
lattice
but
not
looking
out
his
face
was
turned
to
the
interior
gloom
the
fire
had
smouldered
to
ashes
the
room
was
filled
with
the
damp
mild
air
of
the
cloudy
evening
and
so
still
that
not
only
the
murmur
of
the
beck
down
gimmerton
was
distinguishable
but
its
ripples
and
its
gurgling
over
the
pebbles
or
through
the
large
stones
which
it
could
not
cover
i
uttered
an
ejaculation
of
discontent
at
seeing
the
dismal
grate
and
commenced
shutting
the
casements
one
after
another
till
i
came
to
his
i
close
this
i
asked
in
order
to
rouse
him
for
he
would
not
stir
the
light
flashed
on
his
features
as
i
spoke
oh
lockwood
i
can
not
express
what
a
terrible
start
i
got
by
the
momentary
view
those
deep
black
eyes
that
smile
and
ghastly
paleness
it
appeared
to
me
not
heathcliff
but
a
goblin
and
in
my
terror
i
let
the
candle
bend
towards
the
wall
and
it
left
me
in
darkness
close
it
he
replied
in
his
familiar
voice
that
is
pure
awkwardness
why
did
you
hold
the
candle
horizontally
be
quick
and
bring
another
i
hurried
out
in
a
foolish
state
of
dread
and
said
to
joseph
master
wishes
you
to
take
him
a
light
and
rekindle
the
fire
for
i
dared
not
go
in
myself
again
just
then
joseph
rattled
some
fire
into
the
shovel
and
went
but
he
brought
it
back
immediately
with
the
in
his
other
hand
explaining
that
heathcliff
was
going
to
bed
and
he
wanted
nothing
to
eat
till
morning
we
heard
him
mount
the
stairs
directly
he
did
not
proceed
to
his
ordinary
chamber
but
turned
into
that
with
the
panelled
bed
its
window
as
i
mentioned
before
is
wide
enough
for
anybody
to
get
through
and
it
struck
me
that
he
plotted
another
midnight
excursion
of
which
he
had
rather
we
had
no
suspicion
he
a
ghoul
or
a
vampire
i
mused
i
had
read
of
such
hideous
incarnate
demons
and
then
i
set
myself
to
reflect
how
i
had
tended
him
in
infancy
and
watched
him
grow
to
youth
and
followed
him
almost
through
his
whole
course
and
what
absurd
nonsense
it
was
to
yield
to
that
sense
of
horror
where
did
he
come
from
the
little
dark
thing
harboured
by
a
good
man
to
his
bane
muttered
superstition
as
i
dozed
into
unconsciousness
and
i
began
half
dreaming
to
weary
myself
with
imagining
some
fit
parentage
for
him
and
repeating
my
waking
meditations
i
tracked
his
existence
over
again
with
grim
variations
at
last
picturing
his
death
and
funeral
of
which
all
i
can
remember
is
being
exceedingly
vexed
at
having
the
task
of
dictating
an
inscription
for
his
monument
and
consulting
the
sexton
about
it
and
as
he
had
no
surname
and
we
could
not
tell
his
age
we
were
obliged
to
content
ourselves
with
the
single
word
that
came
true
we
were
if
you
enter
the
kirkyard
you
read
on
his
headstone
only
that
and
the
date
of
his
death
dawn
restored
me
to
common
sense
i
rose
and
went
into
the
garden
as
soon
as
i
could
see
to
ascertain
if
there
were
any
footmarks
under
his
window
there
were
none
has
stayed
at
home
i
thought
be
all
right
i
prepared
breakfast
for
the
household
as
was
my
usual
custom
but
told
hareton
and
catherine
to
get
theirs
ere
the
master
came
down
for
he
lay
late
they
preferred
taking
it
out
of
doors
under
the
trees
and
i
set
a
little
table
to
accommodate
them
on
my
i
found
heathcliff
below
he
and
joseph
were
conversing
about
some
farming
business
he
gave
clear
minute
directions
concerning
the
matter
discussed
but
he
spoke
rapidly
and
turned
his
head
continually
aside
and
had
the
same
excited
expression
even
more
exaggerated
when
joseph
quitted
the
room
he
took
his
seat
in
the
place
he
generally
chose
and
i
put
a
basin
of
coffee
before
him
he
drew
it
nearer
and
then
rested
his
arms
on
the
table
and
looked
at
the
opposite
wall
as
i
supposed
surveying
one
particular
portion
up
and
down
with
glittering
restless
eyes
and
with
such
eager
interest
that
he
stopped
breathing
during
half
a
minute
together
now
i
exclaimed
pushing
some
bread
against
his
hand
and
drink
that
while
it
is
hot
it
has
been
waiting
near
an
hour
he
did
notice
me
and
yet
he
smiled
i
rather
have
seen
him
gnash
his
teeth
than
smile
so
heathcliff
master
i
cried
for
god
sake
stare
as
if
you
saw
an
unearthly
vision
for
god
sake
shout
so
loud
he
replied
round
and
tell
me
are
we
by
ourselves
course
was
my
answer
course
we
are
still
i
involuntarily
obeyed
him
as
if
i
was
not
quite
sure
with
a
sweep
of
his
hand
he
cleared
a
vacant
space
in
front
among
the
breakfast
things
and
leant
forward
to
gaze
more
at
his
ease
now
i
perceived
he
was
not
looking
at
the
wall
for
when
i
regarded
him
alone
it
seemed
exactly
that
he
gazed
at
something
within
two
distance
and
whatever
it
was
it
communicated
apparently
both
pleasure
and
pain
in
exquisite
extremes
at
least
the
anguished
yet
raptured
expression
of
his
countenance
suggested
that
idea
the
fancied
object
was
not
fixed
either
his
eyes
pursued
it
with
unwearied
diligence
and
even
in
speaking
to
me
were
never
weaned
away
i
vainly
reminded
him
of
his
protracted
abstinence
from
food
if
he
stirred
to
touch
anything
in
compliance
with
my
entreaties
if
he
stretched
his
hand
out
to
get
a
piece
of
bread
his
fingers
clenched
before
they
reached
it
and
remained
on
the
table
forgetful
of
their
aim
i
sat
a
model
of
patience
trying
to
attract
his
absorbed
attention
from
its
engrossing
speculation
till
he
grew
irritable
and
got
up
asking
why
i
would
not
allow
him
to
have
his
own
time
in
taking
his
meals
and
saying
that
on
the
next
occasion
i
need
wait
i
might
set
the
things
down
and
go
having
uttered
these
words
he
left
the
house
slowly
sauntered
down
the
garden
path
and
disappeared
through
the
gate
the
hours
crept
anxiously
by
another
evening
came
i
did
not
retire
to
rest
till
late
and
when
i
did
i
could
not
sleep
he
returned
after
midnight
and
instead
of
going
to
bed
shut
himself
into
the
room
beneath
i
listened
and
tossed
about
and
finally
dressed
and
descended
it
was
too
irksome
to
lie
there
harassing
my
brain
with
a
hundred
idle
misgivings
i
distinguished
heathcliff
step
restlessly
measuring
the
floor
and
he
frequently
broke
the
silence
by
a
deep
inspiration
resembling
a
groan
he
muttered
detached
words
also
the
only
one
i
could
catch
was
the
name
of
catherine
coupled
with
some
wild
term
of
endearment
or
suffering
and
spoken
as
one
would
speak
to
a
person
present
low
and
earnest
and
wrung
from
the
depth
of
his
soul
i
had
not
courage
to
walk
straight
into
the
apartment
but
i
desired
to
divert
him
from
his
reverie
and
therefore
fell
foul
of
the
kitchen
fire
stirred
it
and
began
to
scrape
the
cinders
it
drew
him
forth
sooner
than
i
expected
he
opened
the
door
immediately
and
said
come
here
is
it
morning
come
in
with
your
light
is
striking
four
i
answered
want
a
candle
to
take
you
might
have
lit
one
at
this
fire
i
do
wish
to
go
he
said
in
and
kindle
a
fire
and
do
anything
there
is
to
do
about
the
room
must
blow
the
coals
red
first
before
i
can
carry
any
i
replied
getting
a
chair
and
the
bellows
he
roamed
to
and
fro
meantime
in
a
state
approaching
distraction
his
heavy
sighs
succeeding
each
other
so
thick
as
to
leave
no
space
for
common
breathing
between
day
breaks
i
send
for
green
he
said
wish
to
make
some
legal
inquiries
of
him
while
i
can
bestow
a
thought
on
those
matters
and
while
i
can
act
calmly
i
have
not
written
my
will
yet
and
how
to
leave
my
property
i
can
not
determine
i
wish
i
could
annihilate
it
from
the
face
of
the
earth
would
not
talk
so
heathcliff
i
interposed
your
will
be
a
while
you
be
spared
to
repent
of
your
many
injustices
yet
i
never
expected
that
your
nerves
would
be
disordered
they
are
at
present
marvellously
so
however
and
almost
entirely
through
your
own
fault
the
way
you
passed
these
three
last
days
might
knock
up
a
titan
do
take
some
food
and
some
repose
you
need
only
look
at
yourself
in
a
glass
to
see
how
you
require
both
your
cheeks
are
hollow
and
your
eyes
like
a
person
starving
with
hunger
and
going
blind
with
loss
of
sleep
is
not
my
fault
that
i
can
not
eat
or
rest
he
replied
assure
you
it
is
through
no
settled
designs
i
do
both
as
soon
as
i
possibly
can
but
you
might
as
well
bid
a
man
struggling
in
the
water
rest
within
arms
length
of
the
shore
i
must
reach
it
first
and
then
i
rest
well
never
mind
green
as
to
repenting
of
my
injustices
i
done
no
injustice
and
i
repent
of
nothing
i
too
happy
and
yet
i
not
happy
enough
my
soul
bliss
kills
my
body
but
does
not
satisfy
itself
master
i
cried
happiness
if
you
would
hear
me
without
being
angry
i
might
offer
some
advice
that
would
make
you
happier
is
that
he
asked
it
are
aware
heathcliff
i
said
from
the
time
you
were
thirteen
years
old
you
have
lived
a
selfish
unchristian
life
and
probably
hardly
had
a
bible
in
your
hands
during
all
that
period
you
must
have
forgotten
the
contents
of
the
book
and
you
may
not
have
space
to
search
it
now
could
it
be
hurtful
to
send
for
some
one
some
minister
of
any
denomination
it
does
not
matter
which
to
explain
it
and
show
you
how
very
far
you
have
erred
from
its
precepts
and
how
unfit
you
will
be
for
its
heaven
unless
a
change
takes
place
before
you
die
rather
obliged
than
angry
nelly
he
said
you
remind
me
of
the
manner
in
which
i
desire
to
be
buried
it
is
to
be
carried
to
the
churchyard
in
the
evening
you
and
hareton
may
if
you
please
accompany
me
and
mind
particularly
to
notice
that
the
sexton
obeys
my
directions
concerning
the
two
coffins
no
minister
need
come
nor
need
anything
be
said
over
i
tell
you
i
have
nearly
attained
heaven
and
that
of
others
is
altogether
unvalued
and
uncoveted
by
me
supposing
you
persevered
in
your
obstinate
fast
and
died
by
that
means
and
they
refused
to
bury
you
in
the
precincts
of
the
kirk
i
said
shocked
at
his
godless
indifference
would
you
like
it
wo
do
that
he
replied
they
did
you
must
have
me
removed
secretly
and
if
you
neglect
it
you
shall
prove
practically
that
the
dead
are
not
annihilated
as
soon
as
he
heard
the
other
members
of
the
family
stirring
he
retired
to
his
den
and
i
breathed
freer
but
in
the
afternoon
while
joseph
and
hareton
were
at
their
work
he
came
into
the
kitchen
again
and
with
a
wild
look
bid
me
come
and
sit
in
the
house
he
wanted
somebody
with
him
i
declined
telling
him
plainly
that
his
strange
talk
and
manner
frightened
me
and
i
had
neither
the
nerve
nor
the
will
to
be
his
companion
alone
believe
you
think
me
a
fiend
he
said
with
his
dismal
laugh
too
horrible
to
live
under
a
decent
roof
then
turning
to
catherine
who
was
there
and
who
drew
behind
me
at
his
approach
he
added
half
sneeringly
come
chuck
i
not
hurt
you
no
to
you
i
made
myself
worse
than
the
devil
well
there
is
who
wo
shrink
from
my
company
by
god
she
relentless
oh
damn
it
it
unutterably
too
much
for
flesh
and
blood
to
bear
even
mine
he
solicited
the
society
of
no
one
more
at
dusk
he
went
into
his
chamber
through
the
whole
night
and
far
into
the
morning
we
heard
him
groaning
and
murmuring
to
himself
hareton
was
anxious
to
enter
but
i
bid
him
fetch
kenneth
and
he
should
go
in
and
see
him
when
he
came
and
i
requested
admittance
and
tried
to
open
the
door
i
found
it
locked
and
heathcliff
bid
us
be
damned
he
was
better
and
would
be
left
alone
so
the
doctor
went
away
the
following
evening
was
very
wet
indeed
it
poured
down
till
and
as
i
took
my
morning
walk
round
the
house
i
observed
the
window
swinging
open
and
the
rain
driving
straight
in
he
can
not
be
in
bed
i
thought
those
showers
would
drench
him
through
he
must
either
be
up
or
out
but
i
make
no
more
ado
i
go
boldly
and
look
having
succeeded
in
obtaining
entrance
with
another
key
i
ran
to
unclose
the
panels
for
the
chamber
was
vacant
quickly
pushing
them
aside
i
peeped
in
heathcliff
was
there
laid
on
his
back
his
eyes
met
mine
so
keen
and
fierce
i
started
and
then
he
seemed
to
smile
i
could
not
think
him
dead
but
his
face
and
throat
were
washed
with
rain
the
dripped
and
he
was
perfectly
still
the
lattice
flapping
to
and
fro
had
grazed
one
hand
that
rested
on
the
sill
no
blood
trickled
from
the
broken
skin
and
when
i
put
my
fingers
to
it
i
could
doubt
no
more
he
was
dead
and
stark
i
hasped
the
window
i
combed
his
black
long
hair
from
his
forehead
i
tried
to
close
his
eyes
to
extinguish
if
possible
that
frightful
gaze
of
exultation
before
any
one
else
beheld
it
they
would
not
shut
they
seemed
to
sneer
at
my
attempts
and
his
parted
lips
and
sharp
white
teeth
sneered
too
taken
with
another
fit
of
cowardice
i
cried
out
for
joseph
joseph
shuffled
up
and
made
a
noise
but
resolutely
refused
to
meddle
with
him
divil
harried
off
his
soul
he
cried
he
may
hev
his
carcass
into
t
bargin
for
aught
i
care
ech
what
a
wicked
he
looks
girning
at
death
and
the
old
sinner
grinned
in
mockery
i
thought
he
intended
to
cut
a
caper
round
the
bed
but
suddenly
composing
himself
he
fell
on
his
knees
and
raised
his
hands
and
returned
thanks
that
the
lawful
master
and
the
ancient
stock
were
restored
to
their
rights
i
felt
stunned
by
the
awful
event
and
my
memory
unavoidably
recurred
to
former
times
with
a
sort
of
oppressive
sadness
but
poor
hareton
the
most
wronged
was
the
only
one
who
really
suffered
much
he
sat
by
the
corpse
all
night
weeping
in
bitter
earnest
he
pressed
its
hand
and
kissed
the
sarcastic
savage
face
that
every
one
else
shrank
from
contemplating
and
bemoaned
him
with
that
strong
grief
which
springs
naturally
from
a
generous
heart
though
it
be
tough
as
tempered
steel
kenneth
was
perplexed
to
pronounce
of
what
disorder
the
master
died
i
concealed
the
fact
of
his
having
swallowed
nothing
for
four
days
fearing
it
might
lead
to
trouble
and
then
i
am
persuaded
he
did
not
abstain
on
purpose
it
was
the
consequence
of
his
strange
illness
not
the
cause
we
buried
him
to
the
scandal
of
the
whole
neighbourhood
as
he
wished
earnshaw
and
i
the
sexton
and
six
men
to
carry
the
coffin
comprehended
the
whole
attendance
the
six
men
departed
when
they
had
let
it
down
into
the
grave
we
stayed
to
see
it
covered
hareton
with
a
streaming
face
dug
green
sods
and
laid
them
over
the
brown
mould
himself
at
present
it
is
as
smooth
and
verdant
as
its
companion
mounds
and
i
hope
its
tenant
sleeps
as
soundly
but
the
country
folks
if
you
ask
them
would
swear
on
the
bible
that
he
there
are
those
who
speak
to
having
met
him
near
the
church
and
on
the
moor
and
even
within
this
house
idle
tales
you
say
and
so
say
i
yet
that
old
man
by
the
kitchen
fire
affirms
he
has
seen
two
on
looking
out
of
his
chamber
window
on
every
rainy
night
since
his
death
and
an
odd
thing
happened
to
me
about
a
month
ago
i
was
going
to
the
grange
one
evening
a
dark
evening
threatening
thunder
and
just
at
the
turn
of
the
heights
i
encountered
a
little
boy
with
a
sheep
and
two
lambs
before
him
he
was
crying
terribly
and
i
supposed
the
lambs
were
skittish
and
would
not
be
guided
is
the
matter
my
little
man
i
asked
heathcliff
and
a
woman
yonder
under
t
nab
he
blubbered
i
darnut
pass
i
saw
nothing
but
neither
the
sheep
nor
he
would
go
on
so
i
bid
him
take
the
road
lower
down
he
probably
raised
the
phantoms
from
thinking
as
he
traversed
the
moors
alone
on
the
nonsense
he
had
heard
his
parents
and
companions
repeat
yet
still
i
do
like
being
out
in
the
dark
now
and
i
do
like
being
left
by
myself
in
this
grim
house
i
can
not
help
it
i
shall
be
glad
when
they
leave
it
and
shift
to
the
grange
are
going
to
the
grange
then
i
said
answered
dean
soon
as
they
are
married
and
that
will
be
on
new
year
day
who
will
live
here
then
joseph
will
take
care
of
the
house
and
perhaps
a
lad
to
keep
him
company
they
will
live
in
the
kitchen
and
the
rest
will
be
shut
up
the
use
of
such
ghosts
as
choose
to
inhabit
it
i
observed
lockwood
said
nelly
shaking
her
head
believe
the
dead
are
at
peace
but
it
is
not
right
to
speak
of
them
with
levity
at
that
moment
the
garden
gate
swung
to
the
ramblers
were
returning
are
afraid
of
nothing
i
grumbled
watching
their
approach
through
the
window
they
would
brave
satan
and
all
his
legions
as
they
stepped
on
to
the
and
halted
to
take
a
last
look
at
the
moon
or
more
correctly
at
each
other
by
her
light
i
felt
irresistibly
impelled
to
escape
them
again
and
pressing
a
remembrance
into
the
hand
of
dean
and
disregarding
her
expostulations
at
my
rudeness
i
vanished
through
the
kitchen
as
they
opened
the
and
so
should
have
confirmed
joseph
in
his
opinion
of
his
gay
indiscretions
had
he
not
fortunately
recognised
me
for
a
respectable
character
by
the
sweet
ring
of
a
sovereign
at
his
feet
my
walk
home
was
lengthened
by
a
diversion
in
the
direction
of
the
kirk
when
beneath
its
walls
i
perceived
decay
had
made
progress
even
in
seven
months
many
a
window
showed
black
gaps
deprived
of
glass
and
slates
jutted
off
here
and
there
beyond
the
right
line
of
the
roof
to
be
gradually
worked
off
in
coming
autumn
storms
i
sought
and
soon
discovered
the
three
headstones
on
the
slope
next
the
moor
the
middle
one
grey
and
half
buried
in
the
heath
edgar
only
harmonized
by
the
turf
and
moss
creeping
up
its
foot
still
bare
i
lingered
round
them
under
that
benign
sky
watched
the
moths
fluttering
among
the
heath
and
harebells
listened
to
the
soft
wind
breathing
through
the
grass
and
wondered
how
any
one
could
ever
imagine
unquiet
slumbers
for
the
sleepers
in
that
quiet
earth
