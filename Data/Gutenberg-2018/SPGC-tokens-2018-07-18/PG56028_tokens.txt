truth
is

stranger
than
fiction

so
strange
will
some
of
the

related

appear
to
western

that
i

it

to
state
that

most

the

at

muang
thai
or
the
kingdom
of
the
free
siam
is
called
by
its
people
muang
thai
the
kingdom
of
the
free
the
appellation
which
we
employ
is
derived
from
a
malay
word
the
brown
race
and
is
never
used
by
the
natives
themselves
nor
is
the
country
ever
so
named
in
the
ancient
or
modern
annals
of
the
kingdom
in
the
opinion
of
pickering
the
siamese
are
of
malay
origin
a
majority
of
intelligent
europeans
however
regard
the
population
as
mainly
mongolian
but
there
is
much
more
probability
that
they
belong
to
that
powerful
race
to
which
europe
owes
its
civilization
and
whose
chief
branches
are
the
hindoos
persians
greeks
latins
kelts
and
the
teutonic
and
sclavonic
tribes
the
original
site
of
this
race
was
in
bactria
and
the
earliest
division
of
the
people
could
not
have
been
later
than
three
or
four
thousand
years
before
the
christian
era
comparative
philology
alone
enables
us
to
trace
the
origin
of
nations
of
great
antiquity
according
to
the
researches
of
the
late
king
who
was
a
very
studious
and
learned
man
of
twelve
thousand
eight
hundred
siamese
words
more
than
five
thousand
are
found
to
be
sanskrit
or
to
have
their
roots
in
that
language
and
the
rest
in
the
tongues
to
which
have
been
superadded
a
great
number
of
chinese
and
cambodian
terms
he
says
the
names
of
temples
cities
and
villages
in
the
kingdom
of
siam
are
derived
from
three
sources
namely
sanskrit
siamese
and
cambodian
the
names
which
the
common
people
generally
use
are
spoken
according
to
the
idiom
of
the
siamese
language
are
short
and
easily
pronounced
but
the
names
used
in
the
court
language
and
in
the
government
documents
which
receive
the
government
seals
are
almost
all
of
sanskrit
derivation
apt
to
be
long
and
even
though
the
sanskrit
names
are
given
at
full
length
the
people
are
prone
to
speak
them
incorrectly
some
of
our
cities
and
temples
have
two
and
even
three
names
being
the
ancient
and
modern
names
as
they
have
been
used
in
the
court
language
or
that
of
the
people
as
the
words
common
to
the
siamese
and
the
sanskrit
languages
must
have
been
in
use
by
both
peoples
before
their
final
separation
we
have
here
a
clew
to
the
origin
and
degree
of
civilization
attained
by
the
former
before
they
emigrated
from
the
parent
stock
besides
the
true
siamese
a
great
variety
of
races
inhabit
the
siamese
territories
the
siamese
themselves
trace
their
genealogy
up
to
the
first
disciples
of
the
buddha
and
commence
their
records
at
least
five
centuries
before
the
christian
era
first
a
long
succession
of
dynasties
with
varying
seats
of
government
figure
in
their
ancient
books
in
which
narrations
of
the
miracles
of
the
buddhas
and
of
the
intervention
of
supernatural
beings
are
frequently
introduced
then
come
accounts
of
matrimonial
alliances
between
the
princes
of
siam
and
the
imperial
family
of
china
of
embassies
to
and
wars
with
the
neighboring
countries
interspersed
with
such
relations
of
prodigies
and
such
marvellous
legends
as
to
surpass
all
possible
conception
of
our
less
fertile
western
imaginations
it
is
only
after
the
establishment
of
ayudia
as
the
capital
of
siam
that
history
assumes
its
rightful
functions
and
the
course
of
events
with
the
regular
succession
of
sovereigns
is
registered
with
tolerable
accuracy
the
name
of
siam
was
first
heard
in
europe
that
is
in
portugal
in
the
year
nine
years
after
alfonso
the
great
viceroy
of
the
indies
had
landed
on
the
coast
of
malabar
with
his
soldiers
and
conquered
goa
which
he
made
the
seat
of
the
government
and
the
centre
of
its
asiatic
operations
after
establishing
his
power
in
goa
subdued
the
whole
of
the
malabar
the
island
of
ceylon
the
sunda
isles
the
peninsula
of
malacca
and
the
beautiful
island
of
ormuz
at
the
entrance
to
the
persian
gulf
it
was
here
that
is
said
to
have
received
the
ambassadors
of
the
emperor
of
persia
sent
to
collect
the
tribute
formerly
paid
to
him
by
the
sovereigns
of
the
island
and
instead
of
the
customary
gold
and
silver
to
have
laid
before
them
iron
bullets
and
a
sword
with
this
is
the
coin
in
which
portugal
pays
those
who
demand
tribute
from
her
whether
this
incident
really
occurred
or
not
it
is
certain
that
made
the
name
of
portugal
so
feared
and
respected
in
the
east
that
many
of
the
potentates
in
that
region
and
among
them
the
kings
of
siam
and
pegu
sent
embassies
to
him
and
sought
his
alliance
and
protection
the
profitable
relations
anticipated
from
this
opening
were
interrupted
however
by
the
long
and
bitter
war
which
shortly
broke
out
between
siam
and
birmah
and
the
intercourse
between
the
siamese
and
portuguese
was
not
renewed
for
a
long
time
as
early
as
the
fifteenth
century
the
celebrated
german
traveller
mandelslohe
visited
ayudia
the
capital
of
siam
and
called
it
the
venice
of
the
east
a
title
equally
applicable
to
the
modern
capital
bangkok
the
portuguese
explorer
mendez
pinto
who
was
in
siam
in
the
sixteenth
century
gives
a
very
favorable
account
of
the
country
and
in
my
opinion
deserves
more
credit
for
the
truth
of
his
statements
than
was
accorded
to
him
by
his
contemporaries
in
an
english
vessel
is
said
to
have
reached
ayudia
and
to
have
found
it
in
ruins
the
country
having
been
laid
waste
by
successive
incursions
of
the
birmese
the
great
river
mèinam
is
the
nile
of
siam
rising
among
the
southern
slopes
of
the
mountains
of
yunan
it
traverses
the
whole
length
of
the
valley
receiving
in
its
course
the
waters
of
many
other
streams
the
most
important
being
the
mèikhong
which
in
its
length
of
nearly
one
thousand
miles
drains
the
eastern
provinces
of
laos
and
cambodia
ancient
annals
relate
that
in
the
fifteenth
and
as
late
as
the
seventeenth
century
chinese
junks
ascended
the
river
as
far
as
sangkalok
nearly
one
hundred
and
twenty
leagues
from
its
mouth
now
owing
to
the
increasing
alluvial
deposit
it
is
not
navigable
more
than
fifteen
leagues
at
most
in
the
month
of
june
the
mountain
snows
begin
to
melt
the
deluging
rains
of
the
wet
season
set
in
the
strong
southerly
winds
dam
up
the
waters
of
the
mèinam
and
it
begins
to
rise
an
event
most
eagerly
looked
for
by
the
people
and
hailed
by
them
as
a
blessing
from
heaven
in
august
the
inundation
is
at
its
height
and
the
whole
vast
valley
is
like
one
immense
sea
in
which
towns
and
villages
look
like
islands
connected
by
drawbridges
and
interspersed
with
groves
and
orchards
the
tops
of
which
only
are
seen
while
boats
pass
to
and
fro
without
injury
to
the
rice
and
other
crops
starting
beneath
them
the
whole
valley
is
intersected
by
canals
some
of
great
size
and
extent
in
order
to
distribute
as
far
as
possible
the
benefits
of
this
grand
operation
of
nature
but
the
lands
situated
about
the
middle
of
the
great
plain
derive
the
greatest
advantage
therefrom
when
the
inundation
is
supposed
to
have
reached
its
height
a
deputation
of
talapoins
or
priests
sent
by
the
king
descend
the
river
in
magnificent
state
barges
and
with
chants
and
incantations
and
movements
of
magical
wands
command
the
waters
to
retire
sometimes
however
the
calculations
prove
to
have
been
incorrect
the
river
continues
to
rise
and
it
is
they
who
are
compelled
to
retire
filled
with
chagrin
and
disappointment
the
popular
river
festival
which
takes
place
after
the
waters
begin
to
subside
both
in
origin
and
character
belongs
to
the
hindoos
rather
than
to
the
buddhists
it
is
an
annual
festival
held
at
night
and
the
scene
which
is
exhibited
during
its
celebration
is
exceedingly
beautiful
the
banks
of
the
mèinam
are
brilliantly
lighted
up
accompanied
and
announced
by
numerous
flights
of
rockets
a
number
of
floating
palaces
built
on
rafts
come
sailing
down
the
stream
preceded
by
thousands
of
lamps
and
lanterns
wreathed
with
chaplets
of
flowers
which
cover
with
their
gay
brilliancy
the
entire
surface
of
the
flashing
water
the
rafts
which
are
formed
of
young
fastened
together
are
often
of
considerable
extent
and
the
structures
which
they
bear
are
such
as
titania
herself
might
delight
to
inhabit
towers
gates
arches
and
pagodas
rise
in
fantastic
array
bright
with
a
thousand
colors
and
shining
in
the
light
of
numberless
cressets
so
the
spectacle
moves
on
while
admiring
crowds
of
men
women
and
children
throng
the
banks
of
the
river
not
only
to
join
the
brilliant
pageant
but
to
watch
their
own
frail
little
bark
freighted
perchance
with
a
single
lamp
yet
full
of
life
brightest
hopes
as
it
floats
unextinguished
down
the
rapid
stream
glimmering
on
with
ruddy
flame
amidst
the
shadows
of
night
the
products
of
siam
as
may
be
supposed
from
its
range
of
latitude
its
tropical
heats
its
variety
of
climate
and
the
fertility
of
the
valley
annually
renewed
by
the
inundation
are
very
diversified
and
almost
unlimited
in
quantity
its
rice
of
which
there
are
forty
varieties
is
excellent
and
its
sugar
is
esteemed
the
best
in
the
world
among
the
other
exports
are
cotton
tobacco
hemp
cutch
dried
fish
and
fruits
beeswax
precious
gums
spices
dye
and
other
woods
especially
teak
ivory
and
many
articles
too
numerous
to
mention
the
mineral
riches
of
the
country
are
still
almost
entirely
in
an
undeveloped
state
the
search
for
sparkling
gems
has
in
all
ages
been
eagerly
engaged
in
diamonds
and
other
precious
stones
are
frequently
offered
for
sale
but
the
precise
locality
in
which
they
are
found
is
kept
secret
by
the
natives
the
more
valuable
seams
of
coal
and
iron
have
remained
unsought
and
most
imperfectly
worked
as
yet
a
beginning
has
at
last
been
made
by
the
present
king
and
the
last
and
best
though
poetically
maligned
age
of
iron
is
about
to
spread
its
blessings
over
the
siamese
empire
the
population
of
siam
can
not
be
ascertained
with
correctness
owing
to
the
custom
of
enumerating
only
the
men
when
i
was
in
bangkok
the
native
registers
gave
the
number
of
them
as
four
million
siamese
one
million
laotians
one
million
malays
and
indians
one
million
five
hundred
thousand
chinese
three
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
cambodians
fifty
thousand
peguans
and
the
same
number
of
mountain
tribes
in
all
nearly
eight
millions
if
these
figures
are
even
approximately
correct
and
the
women
and
children
bear
the
same
proportion
to
the
men
as
in
other
countries
the
total
population
of
siam
far
exceeds
the
numbers
which
have
hitherto
been
assigned
to
it
no
people
in
the
world
exhibit
so
many
exceptional
developments
of
human
nature
as
the
different
races
occupying
the
eastern
peninsula
of
india
the
most
impressible
of
races
ideas
and
views
of
life
take
root
among
them
such
as
would
find
no
acceptance
elsewhere
supple
and
pliant
in
their
bodily
frames
they
are
equally
so
in
their
mental
and
moral
constitution
and
upon
no
other
race
has
the
force
of
circumstance
and
the
contagion
of
example
so
potent
an
influence
in
determining
them
towards
good
or
evil
royalty
therefore
to
them
is
not
a
mere
name
it
has
taken
such
hold
on
their
affections
that
it
usurps
the
place
of
a
religious
sentiment
the
person
of
the
king
is
sacred
he
is
not
only
enthroned
he
is
enshrined
his
rule
may
be
called
despotic
but
it
is
tempered
by
law
and
by
not
less
revered
custom
he
may
name
his
successor
by
will
but
the
royal
or
secret
council
will
determine
whether
that
will
shall
be
carried
into
effect
a
second
king
selected
like
the
first
or
supreme
king
from
the
royal
family
is
also
appointed
by
the
secret
council
whatever
may
have
originally
been
the
functions
of
this
second
king
his
exercise
of
them
appears
from
incidents
of
the
late
reign
to
be
dependent
upon
the
disposition
of
the
supreme
king
and
his
desire
or
disinclination
to
concentrate
in
his
own
person
all
the
powers
of
the
throne
the
whole
empire
is
divided
into
provinces
with
their
respective
phayas
or
governors
and
these
again
are
subdivided
into
districts
under
inferior
officers
respecting
whose
administration
but
little
that
is
good
can
be
said
every
subject
even
the
most
humble
has
by
law
the
right
to
complain
to
the
king
in
person
against
any
official
however
exalted
and
the
king
sits
in
public
at
the
eastern
gate
of
the
palace
to
receive
the
petitions
of
his
people
two
or
three
centuries
after
brahminism
and
caste
had
been
authoritatively
established
in
the
hindoo
code
there
arose
a
new
religion
which
totally
ignored
the
old
one
and
almost
immediately
supplanted
it
as
the
state
religion
of
india
this
was
buddhism
founded
by
gotama
otherwise
called
sakya
muni
a
kshatrya
prince
of
oude
a
of
the
abstract
and
believing
that
the
only
possible
revelation
from
the
supreme
is
that
which
comes
from
within
gotama
educed
a
new
faith
from
the
luminous
depths
of
his
own
soul
his
object
was
not
only
a
religious
but
a
social
revolution
a
good
deal
of
what
was
venerated
as
religion
he
found
to
be
merely
social
usage
for
which
a
divine
sanction
was
feigned
gotama
without
hesitation
rejected
all
this
by
denying
the
inspiration
of
the
vedas
the
existence
of
the
popular
gods
and
the
spiritual
supremacy
of
the
brahmins
his
greatest
blow
to
the
old
religion
however
was
in
his
explicit
repudiation
of
caste
he
offered
his
religion
to
all
men
alike
brahmin
and
sudra
high
and
low
bond
and
free
whereas
for
a
sudra
even
to
look
on
the
vedas
or
to
be
taught
their
contents
was
strictly
forbidden
by
the
brahminical
system
buddha
boldly
expounded
to
the
people
that
according
to
their
own
books
all
men
were
equal
that
brahma
himself
when
asked
to
whom
all
the
prayers
of
the
different
nations
and
races
of
the
earth
were
addressed
replied
i
bear
the
burden
of
all
those
who
labor
in
prayer
i
even
i
am
he
who
prayeth
for
them
through
their
own
lips
and
they
even
they
who
involuntarily
worship
other
gods
believingly
worship
even
me
he
also
did
away
with
the
endless
formalism
of
the
old
faith
and
enjoined
only
a
simple
observance
of
the
fundamental
points
of
morality
and
it
was
only
after
he
had
aided
in
removing
the
social
and
spiritual
shackles
that
oppressed
the
people
that
he
directed
their
attention
to
the
simple
and
weightier
matters
of
religion
hence
the
popularity
it
attained
spreading
among
the
low
caste
as
well
as
among
the
rich
and
great
until
it
has
become
the
dominant
faith
from
the
himalayas
to
ceylon
and
thence
to
siam
china
japan
and
the
neighboring
isles
buddhism
therefore
the
religion
of
the
eastern
world
as
christianity
is
that
of
the
western
is
the
state
religion
of
siam
and
that
of
most
of
its
inhabitants
but
all
religions
are
tolerated
and
absolutely
free
from
interference
all
the
pagan
sects
who
inhabit
this
part
of
india
agree
excellently
and
each
frequently
takes
part
in
the
festivals
of
the
other
and
i
also
observed
that
not
a
few
buddhists
his
late
majesty
included
wear
on
their
foreheads
the
sectarial
mark
of
vishnu
and
siva
united
the
doctrine
of
buddha
inculcates
a
belief
in
one
god
adi
buddha
this
i
infer
not
only
from
the
universally
avowed
conviction
of
the
buddhists
with
whom
i
have
conversed
but
from
buddha
own
words
where
he
says
without
ceasing
shall
i
run
through
a
course
of
many
births
looking
for
the
of
this
tabernacle
who
is
not
represented
by
any
outward
symbol
but
in
a
series
of
buddhas
who
have
been
sent
with
divine
powers
to
teach
the
human
race
and
lead
it
to
salvation
these
are
represented
by
images
often
of
colossal
size
and
great
beauty
and
to
them
the
prayers
of
worshippers
are
addressed
it
inculcates
also
a
belief
in
the
law
of
retribution
or
compensation
and
of
many
births
or
stages
of
probations
through
which
the
human
soul
may
finally
attain
beatitude
buddhism
has
its
priests
and
nuns
separated
from
the
world
and
vowed
to
poverty
celibacy
and
the
study
of
the
divine
law
unlike
the
silent
and
temples
of
egypt
greece
and
italy
the
architectural
grandeur
of
the
buddhist
pagodas
and
temples
is
enhanced
by
the
presence
of
thousands
of
enthusiastic
worshippers
the
sound
of
a
bell
or
gong
or
of
the
sacred
shell
indicates
the
hours
of
the
priests
attendance
at
the
temples
at
such
times
the
priests
are
to
be
seen
officiating
at
the
shrines
where
amid
the
noise
of
many
instruments
playing
in
concert
the
smoke
of
fragrant
incense
and
the
perfumes
of
fresh
flowers
they
are
uttering
sacred
invocations
or
incantations
and
presenting
the
offerings
of
the
worshippers
in
the
sermons
preached
daily
in
these
immense
temples
thronged
with
men
and
women
the
chief
themes
are
humanity
endurance
patience
submission
among
the
practical
precepts
are
these
love
your
enemies
sacrifice
your
life
for
truth
be
gentle
and
tender
abstain
from
war
even
in
govern
yourselves
in
thought
word
and
deed
avoid
everything
that
may
lead
to
vice
be
obedient
to
your
parents
and
superiors
reverence
old
age
provide
food
and
shelter
for
the
poor
the

and
the
oppressed
despise
no
religion
persecute
no
man
but
alas
in
siam
as
in
all
the
rest
of
the
world
the
practice
falls
far
short
of
the
precept
nevertheless
i
have
found
among
the
siamese
also
men
and
women
who
observe
faithfully
the
precepts
of
their
religion
whose
lives
are
devoted
to
charity
and
good
works
and
there
were
some
not
one
alone
but
many
who
during
the
years
i
lived
in
bangkok
sacrificed
their
lives
for
truth
and
even
under
the
torture
and
in
death
showed
a
devotion
and
a
courage
not
to
be
excelled
by
the
most
saintly
of
the
christian
martyrs
polygamy
or
properly
speaking
concubinage
and
slavery
are
the
curses
of
the
country
but
one
wife
is
allowed
by
law
the
king
only
may
have
two
a
right
and
a
left
hand
wife
as
these
dual
queens
are
called
whose
offspring
alone
are
legitimate
the
number
of
concubines
is
limited
only
by
the
means
of
the
man
as
the
king
is
the
source
of
all
wealth
and
influence
dependent
kings
princes
and
nobles
and
all
who
would
seek
the
royal
favor
vie
with
each
other
in
bringing
their
most
beautiful
and
accomplished
daughters
to
the
royal
harem
here
it
is
that
the
courage
intrepidity
and
heroism
of
these
poor
doomed
women
are
gradually
developed
i
have
known
more
than
one
among
them
who
accepted
her
fate
with
a
repose
of
manner
and
a
sweet
resignation
that
told
how
dead
must
be
the
heart
under
that
still
exterior
and
it
is
here
too
that
i
have
witnessed
a
fortitude
under
suffering
of
which
history
furnishes
no
parallel
and
i
have
wondered
at
the
sight
though
the
common
people
have
but
one
wife
the
fatal
facility
of
divorce
effected
by
the
husband
simply
taking
the
priestly
vows
which
can
be
revoked
at
will
is
often
the
cause
of
great
suffering
to
the
women
the
husband
and
father
have
unlimited
power
even
of
life
and
death
over
the
wife
and
children
but
murders
are
extremely
rare
woman
is
the
slave
of
man
but
when
she
becomes
a
mother
her
position
is
changed
and
she
commands
respect
and
reverence
as
a
mother
with
grown
children
she
has
often
more
influence
than
her
husband
hence
maternity
is
the
supreme
good
of
the
woman
of
siam
to
be
childless
the
greatest
of
all
misfortunes
as
was

this

and

piquancy
of
ways
and

who
with
a
clumsy
club
was

fragments

goblets
for
the
foundation
of

rajah

very
artless
and
happy
she
seemed
and
as
free
as
she
was
lovely
but
the
instant
she
perceived
that
she
had
attracted
the
notice
of
the
king
who
presided
at
the
laying
of
the
foundation
of
the
temple
and
flung
gold
and
silver
coins
among
the
workwomen
she
sank
down
and
hid
her
face
in
the
earth
forgetting
or
disregarding
the
falling
vessels
that
threatened
to
crush
her
but
the
king
merely
diverted
himself
with
inquiring
her
name
and
parentage
and
some
one
answering
for
her
he
turned
away
this
is
all
that
is
there
said
of
her
a
week
later
i
saw
the
girl
again
as
i
was
passing
through
the
long
enclosed
corridor
within
the
palace
on
my
way
to
my
in
the
temple
she
was
lying
prostrate
on
the
marble
pavement
among
the
offerings
which
were
placed
there
for
the
king
acceptance
and
which
he
would
inspect
in
his
leisurely
progress
towards
his
i
never
went
that
way
without
seeing
something
lying
there
bales
of
silk
on
silver
trays
boxes
of
tea
calicoes
velvets
fans
robes
precious
spices
silver
gold
and
curiosities
of
all
kinds
in
fact
almost
anything
and
everything
that
money
could
purchase
or
the
most
abject
sycophancy
could
imagine
as
likely
to
gratify
the
despot
every
noble
prince
and
merchant
sought
to
obtain
the
royal
favor
by
gifts
thus
presented
it
being
fully
understood
between
the
giver
and
receiver
that
whoever
gave
the
most
costly
presents
should
receive
the
largest
share
of
royal
patronage
and
support
but
the
most
precious
things
ever
laid
upon
that
pavement
were
the
young
hearts
of
women
and
children
two
women
were
crouching
on
either
side
of
the
young
girl
waiting
for
the
entrance
of
the
king
in
order
to
present
her
to
him
i
was
hardly
surprised
to
see
her
there
i
had
grown
accustomed
to
such
sights
but
i
was
surprised
at
the
unusual
interest
she
appeared
to
excite
in
the
other
women
present
who
were
all
whispering
and
talking
together
about
her
and
expressing
their
admiration
of
her
beauty
in
the
most
extravagant
language
she
was
certainly
very
beautiful
by
nature
and
those
who
sent
her
there
had
exhausted
all
the
resources
of
art
to
complete
according
to
their
notions
what
nature
had
begun
and
to
render
her
a
fitter
offering
for
the
king
her
lips
were
dyed
a
deep
crimson
by
the
use
of
betel
her
dark
eyebrows
were
continued
in
indigo
until
they
met
on
her
brow
her
eyelashes
were
stained
with
kohl
the
tips
of
her
fingers
and
her
nails
were
made
pink
with
henna
while
enormous
gold
chains
and
rings
bedizened
her
person
already
too
much
saddened
by
the
frequency
of
such
sights
i
merely
cast
a
passing
glance
upon
her
and
went
my
way
but
now
as
i
see
in
memory
that
tiny
figure
lying
there
and
the
almost
glorified
form
in
which
i
beheld
it
for
the
last
time
i
can
not
keep
the
tears
from
my
eyes
nor
still
the
aching
of
my
heart
about
three
months
or
so
later
we
met
again
in
the
same
place
i
was
passing
through
to
the
when
i
saw
her
joyously
exhibiting
to
her
companions
a
pomegranate
which
she
held
in
her
hand
it
seemed
to
be
the
largest
and
finest
fruit
of
the
kind
i
had
ever
seen
and
i
stopped
to
get
a
closer
view
both
of
the
girl
and
of
the
fruit
each
perfect
in
its
kind
i
found
however
that
the
fruit
was
not
real
only
an
imitation
it
was
a
casket
of
pure
gold
the
lids
of
which
were
inlaid
with
rubies
which
looked
exactly
like
the
seeds
of
the
pomegranate
when
ripe
it
was
made
to
open
and
shut
at
the
touch
of
a
small
spring
and
was
most
exquisitely
moulded
into
the
shape
and
enamelled
with
the
tints
of
the
pomegranate
it
was
her
where
did
you
get
this
box
i
inquired
she
turned
to
me
with
a
child
smile
upon
her
face
pointed
to
the
lofty
chamber
of
the
king
and
said
my
name
you
know
is
tuptim
pomegranate
i
understood
the
gift
afterwards
i
saw
her
frequently
on
one
occasion
she
was
crying
bitterly
while
the
head
wife
thieng
was
reproving
her
with
unusual
warmth
for
some
fault
i
interrupted
thieng
to
ask
for
some
paper
and
ink
for
the
but
she
paid
no
attention
to
my
demands
instead
of
complying
with
them
at
once
as
usual
she
inquired
of
me
what
shall
i
do
with
this
tuptim
she
is
very
disobedient
shall
i
whip
her
or
starve
her
till
she
minds
forgive
her
and
be
good
to
her
i
whispered
in
thieng
ear
what
said
the
offended
lady
in
an
angry
tone
when
she
does
wrong
all
the
time
and
is
so
naughty
and
wilful
why
when
she
is
ordered
to
remain
up
stairs
she
runs
away
and
hides
herself
in
maprang
or
simlah
rooms
and
we
are
taken
to
task
by
his
majesty
who
accuses
us
of
jealousy
and
unkind
treatment
towards
her
then
we
have
to
search
all
the
houses
of
the
choms
concubines
until
we
find
her
either
in
hiding
or
asleep
and
bring
her
to
him
the
moment
she
comes
into
his
presence
she
goes
down
upon
her
knees
appearing
so
very
bashful
and
innocent
that
he
is
enraptured
at
the
sight
and
declares
that
she
is
the
most
perfect
the
most
fascinating
of
women
but
as
soon
as
she
can
get
away
she
does
the
same
thing
again
only
finding
some
new
and
so
she
makes
an
infinity
of
trouble
now
she
says
she
is
ill
and
can
not
wait
upon
the
king
while
the
physicians
declare
that
there
is
nothing
whatever
the
matter
with
her
i
really
do
know
what
to
do
or
what
to
say
for
i
do
dare
to
tell
the
truth
to
the
king
and
i
in
constant
fear
that
she
will
come
to
a
bad
end
if
she
does
follow
my
advice
and
make
up
her
mind
to
bear
her
life
here
more
patiently
i
pitied
the
poor
girl
who
really
looked
either
sick
or
unhappy
child
as
she
was
there
was
a
great
deal
of
quiet
dignity
about
her
as
with
eyes
filled
with
tears
she
protested
that
she
was
utterly
sick
at
heart
and
could
not
go
up
stairs
any
more
i
was
sure
that
sweeping
reproof
did
not
indicate
any
malice
or
real
anger
towards
the
girl
and
putting
my
arms
around
the
elder
lady
i
succeeded
in
soothing
her
indignation
and
at
length
obtained
permission
for
tuptim
to
be
absent
from
duty
for
a
few
days
a
grateful
smile
lit
up
the
girl
tearful
face
as
she
crept
away
that
girl
is
too
artless
said
thieng
to
me
as
soon
as
the
child
was
out
of
sight
and
she
will
not
even
try
to
like
her
life
here
i
pity
her
from
my
very
heart
mam
dear
but
it
would
not
do
to
show
it
she
would
take
advantage
of
my
kindness
and
keep
away
from
the
king
altogether
as
marchand
does
and
in
all
such
cases
we
head
wives
have
to
bear
the
brunt
of
the
king
displeasure
and
are
thought
to
be
jealous
and
intriguing
when
the
holy
buddh
in
heaven
knows
that
there
is
only
kindness
in
our
hearts
not
long
after
the
above
conversation
tuptim
began
to
come
to
school
she
wanted
to
learn
to
write
her
name
in
english
she
said
and
she
came
to
me
once
or
twice
a
week
until
she
had
acquired
that
accomplishment
which
seemed
to
give
her
immense
satisfaction
after
she
had
done
this
she
asked
me
if
i
would
write
the
name
khoon
bâlât
for
her
in
english
i
wrote
it
for
her
at
once
without
asking
her
why
she
wanted
it
or
whose
name
it
was
i
did
not
even
know
if
it
was
the
name
of
a
man
or
a
woman
as
the
siamese
have
no
masculine
and
feminine
terminations
to
their
names
and
titles
she
immediately
began
to
trace
the
letters
for
herself
and
i
could
see
a
world
of
tenderness
in
her
large
dreamy
eyes
as
she
copied
and
recopied
the
name
in
its
english
characters
i
can
not
rightly
remember
how
often
or
how
long
she
came
to
the
school
for
she
was
but
one
among
many
but
whenever
she
found
me
engaged
with
the
princes
and
princesses
she
would
sit
for
hours
on
the
marble
floor
and
listen
to
our
simple
exercises
of
translating
english
into
siamese
or
siamese
into
english
with
increasing
interest
and
delight
expressed
in
her
pure
guileless
face
i
do
remember
that
she
was
never
alone
but
always
accompanied
by
two
or
three
young
companions
of
about
her
own
age
who
were
as
listless
and
idle
as
she
was
absorbed
and
interested
perhaps
this
was
the
reason
with
her
extreme
youth
for
she
was
still
but
a
child
and
seemed
even
younger
than
she
really
was
why
i
never
attempted
to
enter
into
conversation
with
her
or
to
learn
anything
about
her
history
and
her
feelings
if
i
had
done
this
i
might
have
succeeded
in
winning
her
confidence
and
perhaps
have
been
the
means
of
reconciling
her
to
her
life
in
the
palace
that
i
did
not
will
ever
be
a
source
of
poignant
regret
to
me
one
afternoon
as
i
was
about
leaving
the
palace
after
school
she
came
running
up
to
me
took
a
scrap
of
paper
from
under
her
vest
and
held
it
silently
before
my
eyes
while
i
read
what
was
written
upon
it
it
was
the
name
khoon
bâlât
carefully
written
in
english
characters
and
she
seemed
delighted
with
the
praise
i
bestowed
on
the
writing
whose
name
is
it
tuptim
i
asked
she
cast
down
her
eyes
and
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
raising
them
to
mine
she
replied
it
is
the
name
of
the
favorite
disciple
of
the
chow
khoon
sah
he
lives
at
the
temple
of
rajah
bah
ditt
sang
and
sometimes
preaches
to
us
in
the
palace
the
expression
of
deep
reverence
that
animated
her
face
as
she
spoke
revealed
to
me
a
new
phase
in
her
character
and
i
felt
strongly
attracted
towards
her
i
nevertheless
left
the
palace
without
further
conversation
but
on
my
way
home
formed
a
vague
resolution
that
i
would
endeavor
to
become
better
acquainted
with
her
and
attempt
to
win
her
confidence
my
resolve
was
without
result
however
since
for
some
reason
unknown
to
me
she
never
came
to
the
again
and
as
i
did
not
chance
to
meet
her
on
my
visits
to
the
palace
she
soon
passed
from
my
thoughts
and
i
forgot
all
about
her
some
nine
months
or
perhaps
a
year
after
my
last
encounter
with
tuptim
i
became
conscious
of
a
change
in
the
demeanor
of
my
elder
pupils
they
were
abstracted
and
appeared
desirous
to
get
away
from
their
studies
as
soon
as
possible
it
seemed
as
if
there
were
some
secret
they
had
been
ordered
to
conceal
from
my
boy
and
me
my
imagination
immediately
took
the
alarm
and
i
became
possessed
with
the
idea
that
some
grave
calamity
was
impending
one
day
when
breaking
up
school
for
the
afternoon
i
heard
one
of
the
princes
say
to
the
others
in
siamese
come
let
go
and
hunt
for
tuptim
why
where
has
she
gone
as
soon
as
i
asked
the
question
princess
ying
yonwalacks
angrily
seized
him
by
the
arm
and
hurried
him
away
i
had
no
wish
to
inquire
further
what
i
had
heard
was
enough
to
excite
my
imagination
afresh
and
i
hurried
home
full
of
anxiety
about
poor
little
tuptim
thus
suddenly
brought
back
to
my
remembrance
on
the
following
evening
it
being
sunday
one
of
my
servants
informed
me
that
a
from
the
palace
wished
to
speak
with
me
in
private
when
she
came
in
her
face
seemed
familiar
but
i
could
not
remember
where
i
had
seen
her
or
whose
slave
she
was
she
crawled
up
close
to
my
chair
and
told
me
in
a
low
voice
that
her
mistress
khoon
chow
tuptim
had
sent
her
to
me
you
know
she
added
that
my
mistress
has
been
found
found
i
exclaimed
what
do
you
mean
she
repeated
my
question
and
in
great
astonishment
asked
why
did
you
not
know
that
my
mistress
had
disappeared
from
the
palace
that
his
majesty
had
offered
a
reward
of
twenty
caties
about
fifteen
hundred
dollars
to
any
one
who
would
bring
any
information
about
her
and
that
no
trace
of
her
could
be
discovered
though
everybody
had
been
searching
for
her
far
and
near
no
i
have
never
heard
a
word
about
it
but
how
could
she
have
got
out
of
the
palace
through
the
three
rows
of
gates
that
are
always
bolted
and
not
be
seen
by
the
amazons
on
guard
alas
my
lady
she
did
get
out
replied
the
girl
who
looked
very
wan
and
weary
whose
eyes
seemed
to
have
been
shedding
tears
for
a
long
time
and
who
was
on
the
point
of
breaking
down
again
she
then
went
on
to
tell
me
that
two
priests
had
that
morning
discovered
her
mistress
in
the
monastery
attached
to
the
temple
of
rajah
bah
ditt
sang
and
had
brought
the
information
to
the
king
by
whose
order
she
had
been
arrested
and
imprisoned
in
one
of
the
palace
dungeons
but
what
good
can
i
do
phim
i
asked
sorrowfully
o
mam
dear
if
you
do
help
her
she
lost
she
be
killed
cried
the
girl
bursting
into
a
passion
of
tears
oh
do
do
go
to
the
king
and
ask
him
to
forgive
her
he
grant
her
life
to
you
i
sure
he
will
oh
oh
what
shall
i
do
i
nobody
to
go
to
but
you
and
there
nobody
but
you
can
help
her
and
her
tears
and
sobs
were
truly
i
tried
to
soothe
her
tell
me
phim
i
said
why
did
your
mistress
leave
the
palace
and
who
helped
her
to
get
away
the
girl
would
not
answer
my
question
but
kept
repeating
oh
do
come
and
see
her
yourself
do
come
and
see
her
yourself
you
can
go
to
the
palace
after
dark
and
the
will
let
you
in
nobody
need
know
that
you
are
going
to
see
my
dear
mistress
as
there
was
no
other
method
of
quieting
the
poor
girl
i
finally
made
the
promise
though
i
did
not
see
what
good
my
going
could
do
and
was
fully
convinced
that
phim
had
abetted
tuptim
in
her
whatever
that
might
have
been
after
the
had
left
me
i
sat
by
my
window
and
watched
the
stars
as
they
came
out
one
by
one
and
shone
with
unusual
splendor
in
the
cloudless
sky
it
was
a
lovely
night
and
i
felt
the
soothing
influence
of
the
christian
sabbath
even
in
that
pagan
land
but
the
one
idea
that
took
possession
of
my
mind
was
poor
little
tuptim
in
that
dreadful
dungeon
underground
still
and
notwithstanding
my
promise
i
felt
a
strong
reluctance
to
respond
to
the
cry
which
had
reached
me
from
her
and
wished
that
i
had
never
heard
it
i
was
tired
of
the
palace
tired
of
witnessing
wrongs
i
could
not
remedy
and
half
afraid
too
to
enter
that
weird
mysterious
after
nightfall
so
i
sat
still
in
dreamy
uncertainty
till
a
warm
hand
was
laid
upon
mine
and
i
turned
my
eyes
from
the
stars
above
to
the
poor
sad
face
at
my
feet
the
gates
are
open
for
the
mam
dear
said
she
in
a
low
pleading
voice
and
you
can
get
in
now
without
any
difficulty
i
rose
at
once
resolutely
cast
my
cowardly
fears
behind
me
told
my
boy
where
and
why
i
was
going
put
twenty
ticals
in
my
purse
wrapped
my
black
cloak
about
me
and
hurried
towards
the
palace
gate
phim
had
run
back
at
once
for
fear
of
being
shut
out
for
the
night
the
women
at
the
gates
who
were
all
friendly
to
me
admitted
me
without
question
and
as
i
passed
i
dropped
two
ticals
into
the
hand
of
the
chief
of
the
amazons
on
guard
saying
that
i
had
been
called
into
the
palace
on
important
business
and
begging
her
to
keep
the
inner
gates
open
for
my
return
you
must
be
sure
and
come
back
before
it
strikes
eleven
said
she
and
i
passed
on
as
soon
as
i
entered
the
main
street
within
the
walls
the
joined
me
and
led
the
way
crouching
and
running
along
in
the
deep
shadow
of
the
houses
until
we
reached
the
gate
of
the
prison
in
which
tuptim
was
immured
when
she
immediately
disappeared
the
hall
i
entered
was
immense
with
innumerable
pillars
and
a
floor
which
seemed
to
be
entirely
made
up
of
huge
double
barred
and
locked
while
the
lanterns
by
which
it
was
dimly
lighted
were
hung
so
high
that
they
looked
like
distant
stars
there
were
about
a
dozen
amazons
on
guard
some
of
whom
were
already
stretched
in
sleep
on
their
mats
and
leather
pillows
their
weapons
lying
within
reach
the
eyes
of
all
the
wakeful
custodians
of
the
prison
were
fixed
upon
me
as
i
entered
a
courteous
return
was
made
to
my
polite
salutation
and
ma
ying
taphan
great
mother
of
war
addressed
me
kindly
inquiring
what
was
my
object
in
coming
there
at
that
time
of
night
i
told
her
that
i
had
just
heard
of
tuptim
having
got
into
trouble
and
being
imprisoned
and
had
come
to
ascertain
if
i
could
be
of
any
assistance
to
her
the
child
is
in
trouble
indeed
replied
ma
ying
taphan
and
has
not
only
got
herself
into
prison
but
her
two
young
friends
maprang
and
simlah
who
are
confined
with
her
can
i
not
help
them
in
any
way
i
asked
no
said
the
amazon
gently
i
fear
you
can
not
her
guilt
is
too
great
and
she
must
take
the
consequences
what
has
she
been
doing
to
this
question
i
could
get
no
answer
and
after
vainly
attempting
to
persuade
ma
ying
taphan
to
tell
me
i
tried
to
induce
her
to
let
me
go
down
and
visit
poor
tuptim
myde
impossible
was
the
reply
without
an
express
order
from
the
king
when
you
bring
us
that
we
will
let
you
in
but
without
it
we
can
not
and
myde
was
the
only
answer
i
could
get
to
my
repeated
and
urgent
entreaties
i
sat
there
hopelessly
looking
at
the
amazons
who
in
the
dim
light
of
the
distant
lanterns
overhead
seemed
to
me
to
be
changed
from
women
as
they
were
into
fierce
vindictive
executioners
and
at
the
huge
at
our
feet
beneath
which
the
three
children
as
the
amazon
had
rightly
called
them
were
imprisoned
but
from
which
no
sound
no
cry
no
indication
of
life
escaped
until
tired
and
despairing
i
rose
and
left
the
place
as
soon
as
i
was
out
of
the
building
i
saw
phim
the
crouching
in
the
shadows
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
and
keeping
pace
with
me
as
i
went
towards
the
palace
gate
when
i
turned
into
another
street
she
joined
me
and
i
found
that
she
had
been
hidden
under
the
portico
of
the
prison
and
had
heard
all
my
conversation
with
the
amazons
prostrating
herself
till
her
forehead
touched
my
feet
she
implored
me
in
the
name
of
the
chow
in
heaven
not
to
forsake
her
dear
mistress
she
is
to
be
brought
before
the
court
in
the
outside
hall
of
justice
she
said
oh
do
come
early
perhaps
you
can
persuade
koon
thow
app
to
be
merciful
to
her
and
with
a
sickening
sense
of
my
utter
powerlessness
i
promised
to
be
present
at
the
trial
chapter
iii
tuptim
trial
about
seven
on
the
following
morning
i
was
in
the
sala
or
san
shuang
which
is
within
the
second
enclosure
of
the
palace
but
outside
of
the
third
or
inner
wall
which
is
that
of
the
harem
this
building
is
of
one
story
only
and
totally
unlike
that
occupied
for
similar
purposes
in
the
interior
of
the
grand
palace
the
main
entrance
was
through
a
long
low
corridor
on
both
sides
of
which
opened
apartments
of
different
dimensions
so
dilapidated
as
to
be
scarcely
habitable
looking
out
upon
the
barracks
the
magazine
and
the
fantastic
grounds
of
the
palace
gardens
on
entering
the
hall
one
was
at
once
struck
by
the
incongruities
that
met
the
eye
the
windows
were
large
and
lofty
and
might
have
served
for
the
casements
of
a
royal
residence
while
the
doors
were
very
narrow
and
mean
and
the
floor
merely
a
collection
of
boards
roughly
nailed
down
one
interesting
and
picturesque
peculiarity
was
the
monstrous
size
of
the
spiders
who
must
have
had
undisturbed
possession
of
the
walls
and
ceiling
for
at
least
a
century
altogether
it
was
very
dark
dull
and
dreary
even
depressing
and
sepulchral
when
not
illumined
by
the
direct
rays
of
the
sun
several
of
the
men
and
women
judges
were
already
there
interchanging
greetings
and
offerings
of
the
contents
of
their
baree
rak
the
chief
of
the
men
and
khoon
thow
app
chief
of
the
women
judges
sat
apart
the
latter
with
her
head
bowed
in
an
attitude
of
reflection
and
sadness
before
them
were
low
tables
on
which
lay
dark
rolls
of
laws
siamese
paper
pens
and
ink
some
lower
officials
and
clerks
crouched
around
they
all
eyed
me
with
curiosity
as
i
entered
and
took
a
seat
at
the
end
of
the
hall
near
the
two
priests
who
were
present
as
witnesses
but
no
one
made
any
objection
to
my
stay
i
had
not
been
there
long
when
a
file
of
amazons
appeared
bringing
in
tuptim
and
the
two
other
girls
under
guard
these
were
maprang
and
simlah
tuptim
most
intimate
friends
whom
i
had
always
seen
with
her
when
she
came
to
the
but
was
that
tuptim
i
sat
stupefied
at
the
transformation
that
had
been
wrought
in
the
tuptim
i
had
known
her
hair
was
cut
close
to
her
head
and
her
eyebrows
had
been
shaved
off
her
cheeks
were
hollow
and
sunken
her
eyes
were
cast
down
her
hands
were
manacled
and
her
bare
little
feet
could
hardly
drag
along
the
heavy
chains
that
were
fastened
to
her
ankles
her
scarf
was
tied
tightly
over
her
bosom
and
under
it
her
vest
was
buttoned
up
to
the
throat
her
whole
form
was
still
childlike
but
she
held
herself
erect
and
her
manner
was
when
she
spoke
her
voice
was
clear
and
vibrating
her
accent
firm
and
unflinching
the
amazons
laid
before
the
judges
some
priests
garments
and
a
small
amulet
attached
to
a
piece
of
yellow
cord
the
vestments
such
as
are
worn
by
a
nain
young
priest
were
those
in
which
tuptim
had
been
arrested
and
in
which
she
had
probably
escaped
from
the
palace
the
amulet
in
appearance
like
those
worn
by
all
the
natives
of
the
country
had
been
taken
from
her
neck
on
opening
the
yellow
silk
which
formed
the
envelope
of
the
latter
a
piece
of
paper
was
found
stitched
inside
with
english
letters
written
thereon
khoon
thow
app
was
sufficiently
versed
in
english
to
spell
out
and
read
aloud
the
name
of
khoon
bâlât
tuptim
was
then
ordered
to
come
forward
she
dragged
herself
along
as
well
as
she
could
and
took
her
place
in
the
centre
of
the
hall
she
made
no
obeisance
no
humble
appealing
prostration
but
neither
was
there
any
want
of
modesty
in
her
demeanor
she
sat
down
with
the
air
of
one
who
suffered
but
who
was
too
proud
to
complain
i
caught
a
glance
of
her
eyes
they
were
clear
and
bright
and
an
almost
imperceptible
melancholy
smile
flitted
across
her
face
as
she
returned
my
greeting
i
was
more
astonished
than
before
the
simple
child
was
transfigured
into
a
proud
heroic
woman
and
as
she
sat
there
she
seemed
so
calm
and
pure
that
one
might
think
she
had
already
crystallized
into
a
lovely
statue
simlah
and
maprang
were
examined
first
and
without
apparent
reluctance
confessed
all
that
poor
tuptim
had
ever
confided
to
them
and
a
great
many
other
irrelevant
matters
but
when
simlah
spoke
of
her
friend
escape
from
the
palace
as
connected
with
khoon
coming
in
for
alms
tuptim
interrupted
her
telling
her
to
stop
and
saying
that
not
true
you
are
wrong
simlah
you
know
nothing
about
it
you
know
you
do
and
it
was
not
at
that
time
then
as
if
recollecting
herself
she
added
proudly
no
matter
go
on
never
mind
me
say
all
that
you
want
to
say
and
resumed
her
former
position
well
said
baree
rak
the
chief
man
judge
if
your
companions
know
nothing
about
it
perhaps
you
will
tell
us
exactly
how
it
was
if
i
tell
you
the
whole
truth
will
you
believe
me
and
judge
me
righteously
asked
the
girl
you
shall
have
the
bastinado
applied
to
your
bare
back
if
you
do
not
confess
all
your
guilt
at
once
replied
the
judge
tuptim
did
not
speak
immediately
but
by
the
expression
of
her
eyes
and
the
alternate
flushing
and
paling
of
her
face
it
was
evident
that
she
was
debating
in
her
own
mind
whether
she
should
make
a
full
confession
or
not
finally
with
an
air
of
fixed
determination
she
turned
towards
khoon
thow
app
and
addressing
her
exclusively
said
khoon
bâlât
has
not
sinned
my
lady
nor
is
he
in
any
way
guilty
all
the
guilt
is
mine
in
the
stillness
of
the
nights
when
i
prostrated
myself
in
prayer
before
somdetch
buddh
the
chow
thoughts
of
escaping
from
the
palace
often
and
often
would
distract
me
from
my
devotions
and
take
possession
of
my
thoughts
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
it
were
the
voice
of
the
lord
and
that
there
was
nothing
for
me
to
do
but
to
obey
so
i
dressed
myself
as
a
priest
shaved
off
my
hair
and
my
eyebrows
now
interrupted
baree
rak
that
just
what
we
want
to
hear
tell
us
who
it
was
got
the
priest
dress
for
you
and
shaved
off
your
hair
and
your
eyebrows
speak
up
louder
my
lord
i
am
telling
what
i
did
myself
and
not
what
any
one
else
did
hear
me
and
i
will
speak
the
truth
so
far
as
it
relates
to
myself
beyond
that
i
can
not
go
replied
tuptim
a
sudden
flush
covering
her
face
and
making
her
look
lovelier
than
ever
go
on
said
the
dreadful
man
with
a
scornful
smile
at
the
childish
form
before
him
we
shall
find
a
way
to
make
you
speak
dèck
nak
she
is
very
young
said
khoon
thow
app
gently
tuptim
was
silent
for
some
moments
the
sunlight
streaming
across
the
hall
fell
just
behind
her
revealing
the
exquisite
transparency
of
her
skin
as
with
a
look
more
thoughtful
and
an
expression
more
serenely
simple
still
she
continued
at
five
in
the
morning
when
the
priests
were
admitted
into
the
palace
i
crawled
out
of
my
room
and
joined
the
procession
as
it
passed
on
to
receive
the
royal
alms
no
one
saw
me
but
simlah
and
even
she
as
she
has
told
me
herself
did
not
recognize
me
but
wondered
why
a
priest
came
so
near
to
my
door
that
is
true
broke
in
simlah
i
never
even
knew
that
tuptim
had
run
away
until
khoon
yai
one
of
the
chief
ladies
of
the
harem
sent
to
inquire
why
she
was
absent
from
duty
so
long
and
then
i
began
to
think
that
the
young
priest
i
had
seen
had
something
to
do
with
it
but
i
was
afraid
to
say
anything
of
this
to
the
women
who
searched
the
houses
lest
we
should
be
accused
of
having
helped
her
to
escape
when
simlah
had
done
speaking
tuptim
continued
i
know
not
why
but
when
i
found
myself
outside
of
the
palace
walls
i
went
straight
to
the
temple
of
rajah
bah
ditt
sang
and
sat
down
at
the
gate
towards
evening
the
good
priest
chow
khoon
sah
came
out
and
on
seeing
me
asked
me
why
i
sat
there
i
did
not
know
what
else
to
say
and
so
i
begged
him
to
let
me
be
his
disciple
and
live
in
his
monastery
disciple
art
thou
my
child
he
asked
at
which
i
began
to
cry
for
i
did
not
wish
to
deceive
the
holy
man
seeing
my
distress
he
turned
to
bâlât
who
was
following
him
with
other
priests
and
bade
him
take
me
under
his
charge
and
instruct
me
faithfully
in
all
the
doctrines
of
buddha
then
bâlât
took
me
to
his
cell
but
he
did
not
recognize
in
the
young
priest
i
seemed
to
be
the
tuptim
he
had
known
in
his
boyhood
and
who
had
once
been
his
betrothed
wife
at
this
part
of
tuptim
recital
the
women
held
up
their
hands
in
profound
astonishment
and
the
men
judges
grinned
maliciously
displaying
their
hateful
gums
red
with
the
juice
of
the
the
poor
girl
pale
lips
quivered
and
her
whole
face
testified
to
the
immensity
of
her
woe
as
with
simple
truthful
earnestness
she
asseverated
bâlât
whom
you
have
condemned
to
torture
and
to
death
has
not
sinned
he
is
innocent
the
sin
is
mine
and
mine
only
i
knew
that
i
was
a
woman
but
he
did
not
if
i
had
known
all
that
he
has
taught
me
since
i
became
his
disciple
i
could
not
have
committed
the
great
sin
of
which
i
am
accused
i
would
have
tried
indeed
and
truly
i
would
have
tried
to
endure
my
life
in
the
palace
and
would
not
have
run
away
o
lady
dear
believe
that
i
am
speaking
the
truth
i
grew
quiet
and
happy
because
i
was
near
him
and
he
taught
me
every
day
and
i
can
say
the
whole
of
the
nava
divine
law
by
heart
you
can
ask
his
other
disciples
who
were
with
me
and
they
will
tell
you
that
i
was
always
modest
and
humble
and
we
all
lay
at
his
feet
by
night
indeed
dear
lady
i
did
not
so
much
want
to
be
his
wife
after
he
became
a
priest
but
only
to
be
near
him
on
sunday
morning
those
men
pointing
to
the
two
priests
who
sat
apart
came
to
the
cell
to
see
bâlât
and
it
so
happened
that
i
had
overslept
myself
i
had
just
got
up
and
was
arranging
my
dress
thinking
that
i
was
alone
in
the
cell
when
i
heard
a
low
chuckling
laugh
in
an
instant
i
turned
and
faced
them
and
felt
that
i
was
degraded
forever
believe
me
dear
lady
continued
tuptim
growing
more
and
more
eloquent
as
she
became
still
more
earnest
in
her
recital
i
was
guilty
it
is
true
when
i
fled
from
my
gracious
master
the
king
but
i
never
even
contemplated
the
sin
of
which
i
am
accused
by
those
men
i
knew
that
i
was
innocent
and
i
begged
them
to
let
me
leave
the
temple
and
hide
myself
anywhere
telling
them
that
bâlât
did
not
know
who
i
was
or
that
i
was
a
woman
but
they
only
laughed
and
jeered
at
me
i
fell
on
my
knees
at
their
feet
and
implored
them
entreated
them
in
the
name
of
all
that
is
holy
and
sacred
to
keep
my
secret
and
let
me
go
but
they
only
laughed
and
jeered
at
me
the
more
they
would
not
be
merciful
here
the
poor
girl
gasped
as
if
for
breath
while
two
large
tears
coursed
down
her
cheeks
and
then
i
defied
them
and
i
still
defy
them
she
added
shaking
her
manacled
hands
at
them
the
two
priests
looked
at
the
girl
unmoved
chewing
their
betel
all
the
while
the
judges
listened
in
silence
with
an
air
of
amused
incredulity
as
to
a
she
continued
just
then
bâlât
and
his
other
disciples
returned
from
their
morning
ablutions
i
crawled
to
his
feet
and
told
him
that
i
was
tuptim
he
started
back
and
recoiled
to
the
end
of
the
cell
as
if
the
very
earth
had
quaked
beneath
him
leaving
me
prostrate
and
overwhelmed
with
horror
at
what
i
had
done
in
a
moment
afterwards
he
came
back
to
me
and
while
weeping
bitterly
himself
begged
me
that
i
would
cry
no
more
but
the
sight
of
his
tears
and
the
grief
in
my
heart
made
me
feel
as
if
i
were
being
swallowed
up
in
a
great
black
abyss
and
i
could
not
help
crying
more
and
more
then
he
tried
to
soothe
me
and
said
tuptim
thou
hast
committed
a
great
sin
but
fear
not
we
are
innocent
and
for
the
sake
of
the
great
love
thou
hast
shown
to
me
i
am
ready
to
suffer
even
unto
death
for
thee
this
is
the
whole
truth
indeed
indeed
it
is
well
well
said
baree
rak
you
have
told
your
story
beautifully
but
nobody
believes
you
how
will
you
tell
us
who
shaved
off
your
hair
and
your
eyebrows
and
brought
you
that
priest
dress
you
had
on
yesterday
the
simple
grandeur
of
that
fragile
child
as
she
folded
her
chained
hands
across
her
bosom
as
if
to
still
its
tumultuous
heaving
and
replied
i
will
not
defies
all
description
i
had
drawn
quite
near
to
tuptim
when
she
began
her
simple
narrative
and
was
so
much
absorbed
in
attention
to
what
she
said
and
in
admiration
of
the
fearlessness
as
well
as
of
the
beauty
and
majesty
of
that
little
figure
that
i
had
remained
rooted
to
the
spot
standing
there
mechanically
and
hardly
noting
what
was
going
on
around
me
but
the
effect
of
that
reply
was
startling
it
brought
me
suddenly
to
my
senses
and
to
a
full
appreciation
of
the
scene
before
me
there
was
a
child
of
barely
sixteen
years
hurling
defiance
at
her
own
risk
and
peril
at
the
judges
who
appeared
as
giants
beside
her
to
make
such
a
reply
to
those
executors
of
siam
cruel
laws
was
not
only
to
accept
death
but
all
the
agonies
of
merciless
torture
as
her
refusal
fell
like
a
thunderbolt
upon
my
startled
ears
she
seemed
a
very
titan
among
the
giants
strip
her
and
give
her
thirty
blows
shouted
the
infuriated
baree
rak
in
a
voice
hoarse
with
passion
and
khoon
thow
app
looked
calmly
on
presently
the
crowd
opened
and
a
litter
borne
by
two
men
was
brought
into
the
hall
on
it
lay
the
mutilated
form
of
the
priest
bâlât
who
had
just
undergone
the
torture
in
order
to
make
him
confess
his
guilt
and
that
of
his
accomplice
tuptim
but
as
the
minutes
of
the
ecclesiastical
court
stated
it
had
not
been
possible
to
elicit
from
him
even
an
indication
that
he
had
anything
to
confess
his
priestly
robes
had
been
taken
from
him
and
he
was
dressed
like
any
ordinary
layman
except
that
his
hair
and
eyebrows
were
closely
shaven
they
laid
him
down
beside
tuptim
hoping
that
the
sight
of
her
under
torture
would
induce
him
to
confess
illustration
a
siamese
the
next
moment
tuptim
was
stripped
of
her
vest
and
bound
to
a
stake
and
the
executioners
proceeded
to
obey
the
orders
of
the
judge
when
the
first
blow
descended
on
the
girl
bare
and
delicate
shoulders
i
felt
as
if
bound
and
lacerated
myself
and
losing
all
control
over
my
actions
forgetting
that
i
was
a
stranger
and
a
foreigner
there
and
as
powerless
as
the
weakest
of
the
oppressed
around
me
i
sprang
forward
and
heard
my
voice
commanding
the
executioners
to
desist
as
they
valued
their
lives
the
amazons
at
once
dropped
their
uplifted
bamboos
and
why
so
asked
the
judge
at
least
till
i
can
plead
for
tuptim
before
his
majesty
i
replied
so
be
it
said
the
wretch
go
your
way
we
will
wait
your
return
tuptim
was
unbound
and
the
moment
she
was
released
she
crouched
down
and
concealed
herself
under
the
folds
of
the
canvas
litter
in
which
the
priest
lay
motionless
and
silent
i
forced
my
way
through
the
curious
crowd
who
stood
on
tiptoe
and
with
necks
outstretched
trying
to
get
a
sight
of
the
guilty
pair
on
leaving
the
hall
i
met
the
phim
who
followed
me
into
the
palace
wringing
her
hands
and
sobbing
bitterly
the
king
was
in
his
and
the
smell
of
food
made
me
feel
sick
and
dizzy
as
i
climbed
the
lofty
staircase
for
i
had
eaten
nothing
that
day
nevertheless
i
walked
as
rapidly
as
possible
up
to
the
chair
in
which
the
king
was
seated
fearing
that
i
might
lose
my
courage
if
i
deliberated
a
moment
your
majesty
i
began
to
say
in
a
voice
that
seemed
quite
strange
to
me
i
beg
i
entreat
your
pity
on
poor
tuptim
i
assure
you
that
she
is
innocent
if
you
had
known
from
the
beginning
that
she
was
betrothed
to
another
man
you
would
never
have
taken
her
to
be
your
wife
she
is
not
guilty
and
the
priest
too
is
innocent
oh
do
be
gracious
to
them
and
forgive
them
both
i
pray
your
majesty
to
give
me
a
scrap
of
writing
to
say
that
she
is
forgiven
and
that
the
priest
too
is
pardoned
through
your
goodness
only
let
me
my
voice
failed
me
and
i
sank
upon
the
floor
by
the
chair
i
beg
your
majesty
pardon
you
are
mad
said
the
monarch
and
fixing
a
cold
stare
upon
me
he
burst
out
laughing
in
my
face
i
started
to
my
feet
as
if
i
had
received
a
blow
staggering
to
a
pillar
and
leaning
against
it
i
stood
looking
at
him
i
saw
that
there
was
something
indescribably
revolting
about
him
something
fiendish
in
his
character
which
had
never
struck
me
before
and
i
was
seized
with
an
inexpressible
horror
of
the
man
stupefied
and
amazed
quite
as
much
at
finding
myself
there
as
at
the
new
development
i
witnessed
thought
and
speech
alike
failed
me
and
i
turned
to
go
away
madam
said
that
man
to
me
come
back
i
have
granted
your
petition
and
the
woman
will
be
condemned
to
work
in
the
you
need
not
return
to
the
you
had
better
go
to
the
school
now
i
could
not
thank
him
the
revulsion
of
feeling
was
too
great
i
understood
him
perfectly
but
i
had
no
power
to
speak
i
went
away
without
a
word
and
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
met
one
of
the
women
judges
bringing
some
papers
in
her
hand
to
the
king
instead
of
going
to
the
school
i
went
home
utterly
sick
and
prostrated

can
not

for
the
regard
paid
to
my
words
on
this
and
other
occasions
by
the
officers

court

from
the
fact
of
the
general
belief
that
i
had
great

with

which
is
in

the
supreme

in

chapter
iv
the
king
changes
his
mind
about
two
that
very
afternoon
i
was
startled
to
see
two
scaffolds
set
up
on
the
great
common
in
front
of
my
windows
opposite
the
palace
a
vast
crowd
of
men
women
and
children
had
already
collected
from
every
quarter
in
order
to
see
the
spectacle
whatever
it
might
happen
to
be
a
number
of
workmen
were
driving
stakes
and
bringing
up
strange
machines
under
the
hurried
instructions
of
several
high
siamese
officials
there
was
an
appearance
of
great
and
general
excitement
among
the
crowd
on
the
green
and
i
became
sufficiently
aroused
to
inquire
of
my
maid
what
was
the
reason
of
all
this
preparation
and
commotion
she
informed
me
that
a
bâdachit
guilty
priest
and
a
nangharm
royal
concubine
were
to
be
exposed
and
tortured
for
the
improvement
of
the
public
morals
that
afternoon
it
was
afternoon
already
as
i
afterwards
learned
i
had
no
sooner
left
the
king
than
the
woman
judge
i
had
met
at
the
head
of
the
staircase
laid
before
him
the
proceedings
of
both
the
trials
of
bâlât
and
tuptim
on
reading
them
he
repented
of
his
promised
mercy
flew
into
a
violent
rage
against
tuptim
and
me
and
not
knowing
how
to
punish
me
except
by
showing
me
his
absolute
power
of
life
and
death
over
his
subjects
ordered
the
scaffolds
to
be
set
up
before
my
windows
and
swore
vengeance
against
any
person
who
should
again
dare
to
oppose
his
royal
will
and
pleasure
to
do
justice
to
the
king
i
must
here
add
that
having
been
educated
a
priest
he
had
been
taught
to
regard
the
crime
of
which
tuptim
and
bâlât
were
accused
as
the
most
deadly
sin
that
could
be
committed
by
man
the
scaffolds
or
pillories
on
which
the
priest
and
tuptim
were
to
be
exposed
were
made
of
poles
and
about
five
feet
high
and
to
each
were
attached
two
long
levers
which
were
fastened
to
the
neck
of
the
victim
and
prevented
his
falling
off
while
they
were
so
arranged
as
to
strangle
him
in
case
this
was
the
sentence
all
the
windows
of
the
long
antechamber
that
filled
the
eastern
front
of
the
palace
were
thrown
open
and
i
could
see
the
hurried
preparations
making
for
the
king
the
princes
and
princesses
and
all
the
great
ladies
of
the
court
who
from
there
were
to
witness
the
exquisite
torture
that
awaited
the
hapless
tuptim
paralyzed
by
the
knowledge
that
the
only
person
who
could
have
done
anything
to
mitigate
the
barbarous
cruelty
that
was
about
to
be
perpetrated
her
britannic
majesty
consul
knox
now
was
then
absent
from
bangkok
i
looked
in
helpless
despair
at
what
was
going
on
before
me
i
longed
to
escape
into
the
forest
or
to
take
refuge
with
the
missionaries
who
lived
several
miles
down
the
river
but
so
dense
was
the
crowd
and
so
horrible
the
idea
of
deserting
poor
tuptim
and
leaving
her
to
suffer
alone
that
i
felt
obliged
to
stay
and
sympathize
with
her
and
pray
for
her
at
the
least
i
thus
compelled
myself
to
endure
what
was
one
of
the
severest
trials
of
my
life
a
little
before
three
the
instruments
of
torture
were
brought
and
placed
beside
the
scaffolds
soon
a
long
loud
flourish
of
trumpets
announced
the
arrival
of
the
royal
party
and
the
king
and
all
his
court
were
visible
at
the
open
windows
the
amazons
dressed
in
scarlet
and
gold
took
their
post
in
the
turrets
to
guard
the
favored
fair
ones
who
were
doomed
to
be
present
and
to
witness
the
sufferings
of
their
former
companion
suddenly
the
throng
sent
up
a
thrilling
cry
whether
of
joy
or
sorrow
i
could
not
comprehend
and
the
moment
after
the
priest
was
hoisted
upon
the
scaffold
to
the
right
while
tuptim
tranquilly
ascended
that
to
the
left
nearest
my
windows
i
thought
i
could
see
that
the
poor
priest
turned
his
eyes
full
of
love
and
grief
towards
her
i
need
not
attempt
to
depict
the
feelings
with
which
i
saw
the
little
lady
with
her
hands
which
were
no
longer
chained
folded
upon
her
bosom
look
calmly
down
upon
the
heartless
and
abandoned
rabble
who
as
usual
flocked
around
the
scaffold
to
gloat
upon
the
spectacle
and
who
usually
greet
with
ferocious
howls
the
agonies
of
the
poor
tortured
victims
but
on
this
occasion
the
rabble
were
awed
into
silence
while
some
simple
hearts
here
and
there
firm
believers
in
innocence
were
so
impressed
by
her
calm
that
they
even
prostrated
themselves
in
worship
of
that
childish
form
my
windows
were
closed
upon
the
scene
but
that
tiny
figure
with
her
scarlet
scarf
fluttering
in
the
breeze
had
so
strong
a
fascination
for
me
that
i
could
not
withdraw
but
leaned
against
the
shutters
an
unwilling
witness
of
what
took
place
with
feelings
of
pain
indignation
pity
and
conscious
helplessness
which
can
be
imagined
two
trumpeters
one
on
the
right
and
one
on
the
left
blared
forth
the
nature
of
the
crime
of
which
the
helpless
pair
were
accused
ten
thousand
eyes
were
fixed
upon
them
but
no
sound
no
cry
was
heard
every
one
held
his
breath
and
remained
mute
in
fixed
attention
in
order
not
to
lose
a
single
word
of
the
sentence
that
was
to
follow
again
the
trumpets
sounded
and
the
conviction
of
the
accused
with
the
judgment
that
had
been
passed
upon
them
was
announced
then
the
spell
was
broken
and
some
of
the
throng
as
if
desirous
to
propitiate
the
royal
spectator
at
the
window
made
the
air
ring
with
their
shouts
while
others
going
still
further
showered
all
manner
of
abuse
upon
the
poor
girl
as
she
stood
calmly
awaiting
her
fate
upon
those
shaking
wooden
posts
nothing
could
surpass
the
dignity
of
demeanor
with
which
the
little
lady
sustained
the
storm
of
calumny
from
the
more
mercenary
of
the
rabble
around
her
but
the
rapidity
with
which
the
color
came
and
went
in
her
cheeks
which
were
now
of
glowing
crimson
and
now
deadly
pale
and
the
astonishment
and
indignation
which
flashed
from
her
eyes
showed
the
agitation
within
the
shrill
native
trumpets
sounded
for
the
third
time
the
multitude
was
again
hushed
into
a
profound
silence
and
the
executioners
mounted
a
raised
platform
to
apply
the
torture
to
tuptim
for
one
moment
it
seemed
as
if
the
intense
agony
exceeded
her
power
of
endurance
she
half
turned
her
back
upon
the
royal
spectator
at
the
window
her
form
became
convulsed
and
she
tried
to
hide
her
face
in
her
hands
but
she
immediately
raised
herself
up
as
by
a
supreme
effort
and
her
voice
rang
out
like
a
clear
silver
bell
chân

she
had
hardly
done
speaking
when
she
uttered
an
agonized
cry
wild
and
piercing
it
was
peculiarly
touching
the
cry
was
that
of
a
child
an
infant
falling
from
its
mother
arms
and
she
fell
forward
insensible
upon
the
two
poles
placed
there
to
support
her
the
attendant
physicians
soon
restored
her
to
consciousness
and
after
a
short
interval
the
torture
was
again
applied
once
more
her
voice
rang
out
more
musical
still
for
its
quivering
vibrations
were
full
of
the
tenderest
devotion
the
most
sublime
heroism
i
have
not
sinned
nor
has
the
priest
my
lord

sinned
the
sacred
buddh
in
heaven
knows
all
every
torture
that
would
agonize
but
not
kill
was
employed
to
wring
a
confession
of
guilt
from
the
suffering
tuptim
but
every
torture
every
pang
every
agony
failed
utterly
and
completely
failed
to
bring
forth
anything
but
the
childlike
innocence
of
that
incomparable
pagan
woman
the
honor
of
the
priest
bâlât
seemed
inexpressibly
more
precious
to
her
than
her
own
life
for
the
last
words
i
heard
from
her
were
all
the
guilt
was
mine
i
knew
that
i
was
a
woman
but
he
did
not
after
this
i
neither
heard
nor
saw
anything
more
i
was
completely
exhausted
and
worn
out
and
had
no
strength
left
to
endure
further
sight
of
this
monstrous
this
inhuman
tragedy
kind
nature
came
to
my
relief
and
i
fainted
when
i
again
looked
from
my
window
the
scaffolds
were
removed
the
crowd
had
departed
the
sun
had
set
i
strained
my
eyes
trying
if
i
could
distinguish
anything
on
the
great
common
before
the
house
there
was
a
thick
mist
loaded
with
sepulchral
vapors
a
terrifying
silence
an
absolute
quiet
that
made
me
shudder
as
if
i
were
entombed
alive
at
last
i
saw
one
solitary
person
coming
towards
my
house
through
the
gathering
darkness
it
was
the
phim
whose
life
had
been
saved
by
the
resolute
bravery
of
her
mistress
for
it
was
she
who
had
bought
the
priest
dress
and
aided
her
mistress
to
escape
from
the
palace
she
came
to
me
in
secret
to
tell
me
that
the
most
merciful
and
yet
the
most
dreadful
doom
death
by
fire
which
is
the
punishment
assigned
by
the
laws
of
siam
to
the
crime
of
which
they
were
accused
had
been
pronounced
upon
the
priest
and
tuptim
by
that
most
irresponsible
of
human
beings
the
king
of
siam
that
they
had
suffered
publicly
outside
of
the
moat
and
wall
which
enclose
the
cemetery
watt
sah
katè
and
that
some
of
the
common
people
had
been
terribly
affected
by
the
sight
of
the
priest
invincible
courage
and
of
tuptim
heroic
fortitude
with
her
low
massive
brow
her
wild
glistening
eyes
and
her
whole
soul
in
her
face
she
spoke
as
if
she
still
beheld
that
fragile
form
in
its
last
struggle
with
the
flaming
fire
that
wrapped
it
round
about
and
still
heard
her
beloved
mistress
voice
as
she
confronted
the
populace
holding
up
her
mutilated
hands
and
saying
i
am
pure
and
the
priest
my
lord
bâlât
is
pure
also
see
these
fingers
have
not
made
my
lips
to
lie
the
sacred
buddh
in
heaven
judge
between
me
and
my
accusers
the
grief
was
as
deep
and
lasting
as
her
gratitude
every
seventh
day
she
offered
fresh
flowers
and
odoriferous
tapers
upon
the
spot
where
her
mistress
and
the
priest
had
suffered
firmly
believing
that
their
disembodied
souls
still
hovered
about
the
place
at
twilight
bewailing
their
cruel
fate
she
assured
me
that
she
often
heard
voices
moaning
plaintively
through
the
mellow
evening
air
growing
deeper
and
gathering
strength
as
she
listened
and
seeming
to
draw
her
very
soul
away
with
them
now
tenderly
weeping
now
fervently
exulting
until
they
became
indistinct
and
finally
died
away
in
the
regions
of
the
blessed
and
the
pure
i
afterwards
learned
that
the
fickle
populace
convinced
of
the
innocence
of
bâlât
and
tuptim
would
have
taken
speedy
vengeance
on
the
two
priests
their
accusers
had
they
not
escaped
from
bangkok
to
a
monastery
at
paknâm
and
that
the
twenty
caties
offered
for
the
capture
of
tuptim
had
been
expended
in
the
purchase
of
yellow
robes
earthen
pots
pillows
and
mats
for
the
use
of
the
bonzes
at
watt
rajah
bah
ditt
sang
no
priest
being
allowed
to
touch
silver
or
gold
the
name
bâlât
which
signifies
wonderful
had
been
given
to
the
priest
by
the
chow
khoon
sah
because
of
his
deep
piety
and
his
intuitive
perception
of
divine
and
holy
truths
the
name
which
his
mother
bestowed
upon
him
and
by
which
tuptim
had
known
him
in
her
earlier
years
was
dang
because
of
his
complexion
which
was
a
golden
yellow
on
being
bereft
of
tuptim
to
whom
he
was
tenderly
attached
he
entered
the
monastery
and
became
a
priest
in
order
that
by
austere
devotion
and
the
study
of
the
divine
law
he
might
wean
his
heart
from
her
and
distract
his
mind
from
the
contemplation
of
his
irreparable
loss
for
more
than
a
month
after
tuptim
sad
death
i
did
not
see
the
king
at
last
he
summoned
me
to
his
presence
and
never
did
i
feel
so
cold
so
hard
and
so
unforgiving
as
when
i
once
more
entered
his
he
took
no
notice
of
my
manner
but
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
began
with
what
was
uppermost
in
his
mind
i
have
much
sorrow
for
tuptim
he
said
i
shall
now
believe
she
is
innocent
i
have
had
a
dream
and
i
had
clear
observation
in
my
vision
of
tuptim
and
bâlât
floating
together
in
a
great
wide
space
and
she
has
bent
down
and
touched
me
on
the
shoulder
and
said
to
me
are
guiltless
we
were
ever
pure
and
guiltless
on
earth
and
look
we
are
happy
now
after
discoursing
thus
she

in

royal
palace
of
the
invincible
and
beautiful
archangel
one
morning
in
the
early
part
of
may
i
went
at
the
usual
hour
to
my
temple
and
found
that
all
my
pupils
had
gone
to
the
maha
sâât
to
attend
a
religious
ceremony
at
which
i
also
was
requested
to
be
present
following
the
directions
of
one
of
the
i
turned
into
a
long
dark
alley
through
which
i
hurried
passing
into
another
and
keeping
as
i
thought
in
the
right
direction
these
alleys
brought
me
at
last
into
one
of
those
gloomy
walled
streets
into
which
no
sunlight
ever
penetrated
and
which
are
to
be
found
only
in
bangkok
the
farther
end
of
which
seemed
lost
in
mist
and
darkness
stone
benches
black
with
moss
and
fungi
lined
it
at
intervals
and
a
sort
of
pale
covered
the
pathway
there
was
not
a
soul
to
be
seen
throughout
its
whole
length
which
appeared
very
natural
for
it
did
not
seem
as
if
the
street
were
made
for
any
one
to
walk
in
but
as
if
it
were
intended
to
be
kept
secluded
from
public
use
i
walked
on
however
looking
for
some
opening
out
of
it
and
hoping
every
moment
to
find
an
exit
but
i
suddenly
came
to
the
end
it
was
a
and
a
high
brick
wall
barred
my
further
progress
in
the
middle
of
this
wall
was
set
a
door
of
polished
brass
the
shadow
of
a
tall
and
grotesque
façade
rested
upon
the
wall
and
on
the
narrow
deserted
street
like
an
immense
black
pall
the
solitude
of
the
place
was
strangely
calm
with
that
frightful
din
and
roar
of
the
palace
life
so
near
the
silence
seemed
almost
supernatural
it
cast
a
shadow
of
distrust
over
me
i
almost
felt
as
if
that
wall
that
roof
with
its
towering
front
were
built
of
the
deaf
stones
spoken
of
in
scripture
all
at
once
the
wind
rattled
the
dry
grass
on
the
top
of
the
wall
making
a
low
soft
mournful
noise
i
started
from
my
revery
hardly
able
to
account
for
the
feeling
of
dread
that
crept
over
me
half
ashamed
of
my
idle
fears
i
pushed
at
the
door
with
all
my
might
slowly
noiselessly
the
huge
door
swung
back
and
i
stepped
into
a
paved
with
a
garden
on
one
side
and
a
building
suggestive
of
nocturnal
mystery
and
gloom
on
the
other
the
façade
of
this
building
was
still
more
gloomy
than
that
on
the
outside
of
the
wall
all
the
windows
were
closed
on
the
upper
story
the
shutters
were
like
those
used
in
prisons
no
other
house
could
be
seen
the
high
wall
ran
all
round
and
enclosed
the
garden
the
walks
were
bordered
with
diminutive
chinese
trees
planted
in
straight
rows
grass
covered
half
of
them
and
moss
the
rest
nothing
could
be
imagined
more
wild
and
more
deserted
than
this
house
and
this
garden
but
the
object
that
attracted
my
immediate
attention
was
a
woman
the
only
animate
being
then
visible
to
me
in
the
apparent
solitude
she
was
seated
beside
a
small
pond
of
water
and
i
soon
discovered
that
she
was
not
alone
but
was
nursing
a
naked
child
about
four
years
old
the
moment
the
woman
became
conscious
of
my
presence
she
raised
her
head
with
a
quick
impetuous
movement
clasped
her
bare
arms
around
the
nude
form
at
her
breast
and
stared
at
me
with
fixed
and
defiant
eyes
her
aspect
was
almost
terrifying
she
seemed
as
if
hewn
out
of
stone
and
set
there
to
intimidate
intruders
she
was
large
well
made
and
swarthy
her
features
were
gaunt
and
fierce
but
looked
as
if
her
face
might
once
have
been
attractive
i
relaxed
my
hold
of
the
door
it
swung
back
with
a
dull
ominous
thud
and
i
stood
half
trembling
beside
the
dark
defiant
woman
whose
eyes
only
gave
any
indication
of
vitality
hoping
to
prevail
upon
her
to
show
me
my
way
out
of
that
dismal
solitude
the
moment
i
approached
her
however
i
was
seized
with
inexpressible
dismay
pity
and
astonishment
mingling
with
a
sense
of
supreme
indignation
held
me
speechless
for
a
time
she
was
naked
to
the
waist
and
chained
chained
like
a
wild
beast
by
one
leg
to
a
post
driven
into
the
ground
and
without
the
least
shelter
under
that
burning
sky
the
chain
was
of
and
heavy
consisting
of
seven
long
attached
to
a
ring
and
fitted
close
to
the
right
leg
just
above
the
ankle
it
was
secured
to
the
post
by
a
rivet
under
her
lay
a
tattered
fragment
of
matting
farther
on
a
block
of
wood
for
a
pillow
and
on
the
other
side
were
several
broken
chinese
umbrellas
growing
more
and
more
bewildered
i
sat
down
and
looked
at
the
woman
in
a
sort
of
helpless
despair
the
whole
scene
was
startlingly
impressive
the
apathy
the
deadness
and
the
barbarous
cruelty
of
the
palace
life
were
never
more
strikingly
brought
before
me
face
to
face
here
there
was
no
doubting
no
denying
no
questioning
the
fact
that
this
unhappy
creature
was
suffering
under
some
cruel
wrong
which
no
one
cared
to
redress
naked
to
the
waist
her
long
filthy
hair
bound
in
dense
masses
around
her
brow
she
sat
calmly
uncomplainingly
under
a
burning
tropical
sun
such
as
we
children
of
a
more
temperate
clime
can
hardly
imagine
fierce
lurid
and
scorching
nursing
at
her
breast
a
child
full
of
health
and
begrimed
with
dirt
with
a
tenderness
that
would
have
graced
the
most
gentlewoman
i
remained
long
and
indignantly
silent
before
i
could
find
voice
for
the
questions
that
rose
to
my
lips
but
at
length
i
inquired
her
name
begone
was
her
fierce
reply
why
art
thou
thus
chained
wilt
thou
not
tell
me
i
pleaded
pye
go
said
the
woman
snatching
her
breast
impatiently
from
the
sucking
child
and
at
the
same
time
turning
her
back
upon
me
the
child
set
up
a
tremendous
scream
which
was
through
the
strange
place
the
woman
turned
and
took
him
into
her
arms
and
as
if
there
were
an
indwelling
persuasiveness
about
them
he
was
quieted
in
an
instant
rocking
him
to
and
fro
with
her
face
resting
against
his
unwashed
cheek
she
was
no
longer
repulsive
but
glorious
clothed
in
the
beauty
and
strength
of
a
noble
human
love
i
rose
respectfully
from
the
low
wall
of
the
pond
where
i
had
seated
myself
and
took
my
place
on
the
heated
pavement
beside
the
woman
and
her
child
then
as
gently
and
as
kindly
as
i
could
i
asked
his
name
and
age
he
is
four
years
old
she
replied
curtly
and
his
name
his
name
is
thook
sorrow
said
the
woman
turning
away
her
face
and
why
hast
thou
given
him
such
a
name
what
is
that
to
thee
woman
was
the
sharp
rejoinder
after
this
she
relapsed
into
a
grim
silence
seeming
to
gaze
intently
into
the
empty
air
but
at
length
there
came
a
sob
and
she
passed
her
bare
arms
slowly
across
her
eyes
this
served
as
a
signal
for
the
little
fellow
to
begin
to
scream
again
which
he
did
most
lustily
the
woman
after
quieting
him
turned
to
me
and
to
my
great
surprise
began
to
talk
of
her
own
accord
with
but
few
questions
on
my
part
hast
thou
come
here
to
seek
me
lady
has
the
naikodah
my
husband
sent
thee
tell
me
is
he
well
hast
thou
come
to
buy
me
ah
lady
will
thou
not
buy
me
will
thou
not
help
me
to
get
my
pardon
tell
me
why
thou
art
chained
what
is
thy
crime
this
seemed
a
terrible
question
for
the
poor
woman
in
vain
she
attempted
to
speak
her
lips
moved
but
uttered
no
sound
her
features
quivered
and
with
one
convulsive
movement
she
threw
up
her
arms
and
burst
into
an
agony
of
tears
she
sobbed
passionately
for
some
time
then
passing
into
a
quieter
mood
turned
to
me
and
said
bitterly
do
you
want
to
know
of
what
crime
i
am
accused
it
is
the
crime
of
loving
my
husband
and
seeking
to
be
with
him
but
what
induced
you
to
become
a
slave
i
was
born
a
slave
lady
it
was
the
will
of
allah
you
are
a
mohammedan
then
my
parents
were
mohammedans
slaves
to
the
father
of
my
mistress
chow
chom
manda
ung
when
we
were
yet
young
my
brother
and
i
were
sent
as
slaves
to
her
daughter
the
princess
ong
brittry
if
you
can
prove
that
your
parents
were
mohammedans
i
can
help
you
i
think
because
all
the
mohammedans
here
are
under
british
protection
and
no
subject
of
britain
can
be
a
slave
but
lady
my
parents
sold
themselves
to
my
mistress
grandfather
that
was
your
father
debt
which
your
mother
and
father
have
paid
over
and
over
again
by
a
life
of
faithful
servitude
you
can
insist
upon
your
mistress
accepting
your
insist
said
the
woman
her
large
dark
eyes
glowing
with
the
tears
still
glistening
in
them
you
do
not
know
what
you
say
you
do
not
know
that
my
mistress
chow
chom
manda
ung
is
to
the
king
and
that
her
daughter
princess
ong
brittry
is
his
favorite
and
queen
my
only
hope
lies
in
a
special
pardon
from
my
mistress
herself
and
your
friends
said
i
do
they
know
nothing
of
your
cruel
captivity
nothing
indeed
i
have
no
opportunity
to
speak
even
to
the
whose
duty
it
is
to
feed
us
daily
and
her
lot
is
too
sad
already
for
her
to
be
willing
to
run
any
great
risk
for
me
the
secrecy
and
mystery
of
my
sudden
disappearance
have
been
preserved
so
long
because
i
am
chained
here
no
one
comes
here
but
my
mistress
and
she
only
visits
this
place
occasionally
with
the
most
tried
and
trusted
of
her
eleven
boomed
like
a
through
the
solitude
the
woman
laid
herself
down
beside
her
sleeping
boy
to
rest
apparently
worn
out
with
a
sense
of
her
misery
i
placed
my
small
umbrella
over
them
and
this
simple
act
of
kindness
so
touched
the
poor
thing
that
she
started
up
suddenly
and
before
i
could
prevent
her
passionately
kissed
my
soiled
and
dusty
shoes
i
was
so
sorry
for
the
unhappy
creature
that
tears
filled
my
eyes
my
sister
said
i
tell
me
your
whole
story
and
i
will
lay
it
before
the
king
the
woman
started
up
and
adjusted
the
umbrella
over
the
sleeping
child
her
eyes
beamed
with
a
fire
as
if
from
above
while
with
wonderful
power
combined
with
sweetness
and
delicacy
she
repeated
her
sad
tale
there
is
sorrow
in
my
heart
lady
where
once
there
was
nothing
but
passive
endurance
in
my
soul
i
now
hear
whisperings
of
things
that
are
between
heaven
and
earth
yea
and
beyond
the
heaven
of
heavens
where
once
there
was
nothing
but
blind
obedience
unconscious
of
the
beauty
of
life
my
heart
was
as
if
frozen
and
inert
until
i
met
the
naikodah
my
husband
lady
as
i
told
you
i
and
my
brother
were
born
slaves
and
so
faithful
were
we
that
my
brother
obtained
as
proof
of
the
trust
my
lady
reposed
in
him
the
charge
of
a
rice
plantation
at
ayudia
while
i
was
promoted
to
be
the
chief
attendant
of
the
princess
ong
brittry
one
day
my
mistress
intrusted
to
my
care
a
bag
of
money
to
purchase
some
bombay
silk
of
the
naikodah
ibrahim
as
it
was
the
first
time
for
many
years
that
i
had
been
permitted
to
quit
the
gates
of
the
gloomy
palace
i
felt
on
that
day
as
if
i
had
come
into
the
world
anew
as
if
my
previous
life
had
been
nothing
but
a
dream
and
my
recollections
of
that
day
are
always
present
to
my
mind
and
saying
to
me
how
happy
you
were
once
be
patient
now
oh
on
that
day
the
mèinam
splashed
and
rippled
more
enchantingly
seemed
broader
and
more
beautiful
than
ever
the
green
leaves
and
buds
seemed
to
have
burst
forth
all
of
a
sudden
how
beautifully
green
the
grass
was
and
how
clearly
and
joyously
the
birds
on
the
bushes
and
in
the
trees
poured
forth
their
song
as
if
purposely
for
me
while
from
the
distant
plain
across
the
river
floated
the
aromatic
breath
of
flowers
filling
me
with
inexpressible
delight
i
was
silent
with
a
feeling
of
supreme
happiness
on
that
day
a
new
light
had
risen
in
the
east
a
light
which
was
to
enlighten
and
to
darken
all
my
coming
life
we
moored
our
boat
by
the
bank
of
the
river
and
made
our
way
to
the
shop
of
the
naikodah
which
my
companions
entered
while
i
sat
outside
on
the
steps
until
the
bargain
should
be
completed
my
companions
and
the
merchant
could
come
to
no
terms
i
entered
with
the
bag
of
money
hoping
by
the
sight
of
the
silver
to
induce
him
to
sell
the
silk
for
the
price
offered
but
on
entering
i
seemed
to
be
dazzled
by
something
i
know
not
what
the
merchant
eyes
flashed
upon
me
as
it
were
with
a
look
of
recollection
and
by
their
expression
reminded
me
of
some
face
i
had
seen
in
my
infancy
or
perhaps
in
my
dreams
i
drew
my
faded
tattered
scarf
more
tightly
around
my
chest
and
sat
down
silent
and
wondering
not
daring
to
ask
myself
where
i
had
seen
that
face
before
or
why
it
produced
such
an
effect
upon
me
illustration
a
siamese
after
a
great
deal
of
talking
and
bargaining
about
the
silk
we
came
away
without
it
but
the
next
day
went
again
to
the
merchant
and
purchased
it
at
his
own
price
i
was
surprised
however
to
find
that
when
i
paid
him
the
money
he
left
five
ticals
in
my
hands
is
our
kumrie
perquisite
said
the
women
snatching
the
ticals
out
of
my
hand
and
pocketing
them
time
after
time
we
repeated
our
visits
to
the
merchant
who
was
constantly
kind
and
respectful
in
his
manner
towards
me
he
always
left
five
ticals
for
us
my
companions
took
the
money
but
i
persistently
refused
to
share
in
this
pitiful
kind
of
profit
the
merchant
began
to
observe
me
more
closely
and
as
i
thought
to
take
an
interest
in
me
and
one
day
after
we
had
purchased
some
boxes
of
fragrant
candles
and
and
i
had
paid
him
the
full
price
for
his
goods
he
left
twenty
ticals
on
the
floor
beside
me
my
companions
called
my
attention
to
the
money
when
the
merchant
observing
my
unwillingness
to
receive
it
took
up
fifteen
ticals
leaving
the
usual
kumrie
of
five
upon
the
floor
which
my
companions
picked
up
and
appropriated
we
returned
as
was
our
custom
by
the
river
slowly
paddling
our
little
canoe
down
the
broad
and
beautiful
stream
and
enjoying
every
moment
of
our
permitted
freedom
i
was
sorely
unwilling
to
return
to
the
palace
i
was
even
tempted
to
plunge
into
the
water
and
make
good
my
escape
but
the
responsibility
of
the
money
intrusted
to
my
care
made
me
hesitate
and
the
tranquil
surface
of
the
mèinam
broken
only
by
its
circling
ripples
helped
to
dissipate
my
wicked
thoughts
still
i
indulged
though
almost
unconsciously
the
hope
of
obtaining
my
freedom
some
day
without
even
forming
a
thought
as
to
how
it
could
ever
be
accomplished
how
or
why
i
began
to
think
of
getting
free
i
know
not
i
seemed
to
inhale
a
longing
for
freedom
with
the
fragrance
of
flowers
wafted
to
me
on
the
fresh
invigorating
air
every
tree
in
blossom
every
wild
flower
clothed
in
its
splendor
of
red
and
orange
made
me
dream
as
naturally
of
liberty
as
it
did
of
love
and
i
prayed
for
freedom
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
even
as
for
the
first
time
i
felt
the
strength
of
a
supreme
emotion
overpowering
me
here
the
woman
paused
for
a
few
moments
and
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
she
expressed
herself
so
well
until
i
remembered
that
the
princesses
of
siam
make
it
a
special
point
to
educate
the
slaves
born
in
their
household
so
that
in
most
oriental
accomplishments
they
generally
surpass
the
common
people
who
may
have
become
slaves
by
purchase
there
was
something
very
simple
and
attractive
in
the
way
she
spoke
of
herself
and
throughout
our
whole
interview
she
manifested
such
gentleness
and
resignation
that
she
completely
won
my
affection
and
pity
after
a
while
she
smiled
sadly
and
said
softly
ah
lady
we
all
love
god
and
we
are
all
loved
by
him
yet
he
has
seen
fit
to
make
some
masters
and
others
slaves
strange
as
the
delusion
may
appear
to
you
who
are
free
and
perfectly
happy
while
the
slave
is
not
happy
the
more
impossible
seemed
the
realization
of
my
hope
of
freedom
the
more
i
thought
of
it
and
longed
for
it
one
day
a
came
to
my
mistress
with
some
new
goods
from
the
naikodah
and
on
seeing
me
she
begged
for
a
drink
of
water
and
some
cere
as
i
handed
her
the
water
she
said
to
me
in
a
low
tone
art
a
moslem
free
thyself
from
this
bondage
to
an
unbelieving
race
take
from
my
master
the
price
of
thy
freedom
come
out
of
this
naiwang
palace
and
be
restored
to
the
true
people
of
god
i
listened
in
amazement
fearing
to
break
the
enchanting
spell
of
her
words
and
hardly
believing
that
i
had
heard
aright
she
quitted
me
suddenly
fearful
of
exciting
suspicion
and
left
me
in
such
a
disturbed
state
of
mind
as
i
had
never
before
experienced
my
thoughts
flew
hither
and
thither
like
birds
overtaken
by
a
sudden
storm
flapping
their
silent
and
despairing
wings
against
the
closed
and
barred
gates
of
my
prison
i
found
comfort
only
in
trusting
to
the
above
and
with
the
instinct
of
all
sufferers
i
turned
at
once
to
him
when
i
saw
the
woman
a
second
time
i
embraced
the
opportunity
to
say
to
her
tell
me
how
shall
i
obtain
my
will
not
thy
master
hold
me
as
his
slave
will
give
thee
the
money
and
will
never
repent
having
freed
a
moslem
and
the
daughter
of
a
believer
from
slavery
thou
angel
of
life
said
i
clasping
her
to
my
throbbing
heart
am
already
his
slave
she
released
my
arms
from
around
her
neck
and
taking
some
silver
from
her
scarf
tied
it
firmly
into
mine
without
another
word
and
i
fearing
lest
i
should
be
discovered
with
so
much
money
in
my
possession
came
here
by
night
and
hid
it
under
this
very
pavement
on
which
we
are
seated
some
weeks
after
we
were
sent
again
to
the
naikodah
to
buy
some
tapers
and
flowers
for
the
cremation
of
the
young
princess
ong
i
never
was
so
conscious
of
the
shabbiness
of
my
dress
as
when
i
entered
the
presence
of
the
good
merchant
we
made
our
purchase
paid
the
money
and
as
i
rose
to
depart
my
friend
the
who
had
been
employed
by
the
naikodah
to
speak
to
me
beckoned
me
to
come
into
an
inner
chamber
i
was
followed
by
her
master
who
addressed
himself
to
me
and
said
i
remember
the
words
so
well
thou
art
of
form
so
beauteous
and
of
spirit
so
guileless
thou
hast
awakened
all
my
love
and
pity
see
here
is
the
money
thou
hast
just
paid
me
double
the
price
of
thy
freedom
and
forget
not
thy
deliverer
allah
prosper
thee
said
i
was
overwhelmed
my
astonishment
and
my
gratitude
at
his
goodness
knew
no
bounds
i
tried
to
speak
my
tongue
clave
to
the
roof
of
my
mouth
as
if
held
back
by
an
evil
genius
i
could
not
give
utterance
to
a
single
word
in
expression
of
my
feelings
my
heart
heaved
my
eyes
glowed
my
cheeks
burned
my
blushes
came
and
went
showing
the
depth
of
my
emotion
and
i
burst
into
tears
i
returned
to
the
palace
hid
the
money
and
waited
my
opportunity
thus
i
lived
in
bondage
within
and
bondage
without
freedom
within
my
grasp
and
slavery
in
my
heart
am
more
a
slave
than
ever
said
i
to
myself
the
servitude
of
the
heart
the
sweet
feverish
servitude
of
love
who
will
ransom
me
from
these
who
can
buy
me
freedom
from
these
henceforth
and
forever
i
am
the
good
slave
i
waited
my
time
like
a
lover
lying
in
wait
for
his
mistress
like
a
mother
watching
the
return
of
an
only
child
and
i
waited
long
and
anxiously
praying
to
god
calling
him
allah
calling
him
buddha
father
goodness
compassion
praying
for
liberty
only
praying
only
for
freedom
one
day
my
mistress
chow
chom
manda
ung
was
so
kind
and
pleasant
to
me
that
i
believed
my
opportunity
had
come
i
seized
it
threw
myself
at
her
feet
and
said
dear
be
pitiful
to
thy
child
hear
but
her
prayer
it
is
the
only
desire
of
her
heart
the
dream
of
thy
slave
life
as
the
thirsty
traveller
beholds
afar
off
the
everlasting
springs
of
water
as
the
dying
man
has
foretastes
of
immortality
even
so
thy
slave
has
through
thy
goodness
tasted
of
freedom
and
would
more
fully
drink
of
the
cup
if
thou
in
thy
bountiful
goodness
would
but
let
her
go
free
here
is
the
price
of
my
freedom
dear
lady
be
pitiful
and
set
me
free
wert
born
my
slave
said
my
lady
will
take
no
money
for
thee
double
lady
dear
but
o
let
me
go
thou
wishest
to
be
married
said
my
mistress
will
find
thee
a
good
and
able
husband
and
thou
shalt
bear
me
children
even
as
thy
mother
did
before
thee
but
i
will
not
let
thee
go
free
in
my
despair
i
prayed
i
entreated
with
tears
blinding
my
eyes
i
promised
that
my
children
yet
unborn
should
be
her
slaves
if
she
would
only
let
me
go
it
was
all
in
vain
i
gathered
up
my
silver
and
returned
to
my
life
hopelessly
defeated
i
soon
recovered
from
my
disappointment
however
because
i
was
strengthened
by
the
determination
to
escape
at
the
first
opportunity
that
offered
itself
to
me
this
enabled
me
to
bear
my
captivity
bravely
my
mistress
distrusted
me
for
a
long
time
my
companions
seeing
that
i
had
fallen
into
disgrace
pitied
me
but
i
did
my
best
to
show
myself
willing
obedient
and
cheerful
until
when
nearly
two
whole
years
had
passed
away
my
mistress
gradually
took
me
again
into
her
confidence
and
at
last
arranged
a
marriage
for
me
with
nai
tim
one
of
her
favorite
to
all
her
plans
i
offered
not
a
word
of
objection
i
pretended
that
i
was
really
pleased
at
the
prospect
of
being
free
to
spend
six
months
of
every
year
with
my
husband
the
day
before
my
marriage
i
was
sent
to
see
nai
tim
mother
with
a
small
present
from
my
mistress
two
strong
women
accompanied
me
hidden
in
my
nung
was
my
as
soon
as
we
entered
my
future
house
i
requested
permission
to
speak
with
her
alone
supposing
that
i
had
some
private
communication
to
make
to
her
from
my
mistress
she
took
me
into
the
back
part
of
the
house
and
i
seated
myself
on
the
edge
of
the
bamboo
raft
which
kept
her
little
hut
afloat
on
the
mèinam
rushing
by
so
strong
and
swift
without
giving
her
time
to
think
i
told
her
my
whole
story
from
beginning
to
end
put
the
money
into
her
hands
and
before
the
startled
woman
could
refuse
or
remonstrate
i
plunged
with
one
sudden
bound
into
the
bosom
of
the
broad
river
i
heard
a
shriek
above
me
as
i
disappeared
under
the
waters
that
received
me
into
their
cool
refreshing
depths
how
desperately
i
swam
through
the
strong
currents
coming
up
to
the
surface
from
time
to
time
to
draw
a
long
breath
then
diving
back
into
its
protecting
shelter
again
finding
my
strength
failing
me
i
made
for
the
opposite
bank
climbed
its
steep
sides
and
dried
my
clothes
in
the
soft
delicious
breezes
that
came
upon
me
as
if
just
let
free
from
the
highest
heavens
filled
with
the
inspiration
of
freedom
and
of
love
i
had
accomplished
that
which
had
been
the
beginning
and
the
ending
of
all
my
thoughts
for
so
long
a
time
for
one
moment
it
seemed
to
me
an
impossibility
but
on
the
next
my
joy
was
so
excessive
that
i
stooped
down
and
kissed
the
earth
and
then
laughed
outright
from
day
to
day
my
soul
had
been
slowly
withering
away
now
it
blossomed
forth
afresh
as
if
it
had
never
known
a
moment
of
sorrow
my
glad
laughter
came
back
to
me
and
in
very
truth
lady
i
shall
never
again
rejoice
and
sing
in
the
desert
places
of
my
heart
or
in
the
solitary
places
of
my
native
land
as
i
did
on
that
day
in
my
extreme
emotion
i
forgot
that
night
was
a
possibility
i
could
do
nothing
but
rejoice
suddenly
the
sun
set
the
night
descended
darkness
covered
the
earth
as
with
a
mantle
the
wind
began
to
blow
in
gusts
i
heard
strange
sounds
sounds
which
seemed
to
come
not
from
the
earth
but
from
some
frightful
realm
beyond
but
i
knew
there
were
angels
who
heard
the
cries
of
human
distress
i
prayed
to
them
to
come
and
hover
near
me
and
as
i
prayed
a
deep
sleep
came
upon
me
when
i
woke
the
stars
were
in
the
sky
but
the
strange
noises
disturbed
me
so
that
i
fell
on
my
knees
and
cried
god
where
art
thou
o
bring
the
day
come
with
thy
swift
chariot
and
bring
the
light
come
and
help
thy
unworthy
handmaiden
believe
says
the
prophet
to
have
the
world
renewed
every
day
so
in
answer
to
my
prayer
came
the
angel
gibhrayeel
and
snatched
away
the
dark
mantle
of
khām
the
god
of
night
and
swift
came
athiet
the
god
of
day
scattering
the
shadowy
monsters
of
the
world
of
night
and
making
his
glory
fill
my
heart
with
praise
even
as
it
filled
my
glad
eyes
with
light
i
had
been
dazzled
with
the
idea
of
liberty
i
had
thought
only
of
getting
free
but
now
came
the
questions
where
shall
i
go
who
will
employ
me
and
the
answer
was
clear
to
me
there
was
no
one
in
all
this
vast
city
to
whom
i
could
turn
but
the
merchant
and
his
and
to
them
i
went
it
was
evening
when
i
entered
the
hut
of
the
slave
footsore
hungry
and
weary
was
overjoyed
to
see
me
she
gave
me
food
and
shelter
and
her
best
robe
some
days
after
the
good
merchant
came
to
visit
me
i
felt
dimly
that
the
hardness
of
my
heart
would
be
complete
if
i
resisted
his
kindness
to
his
celestial
tenderness
i
opposed
no
word
of
doubt
yet
i
could
not
believe
that
the
rich
merchant
would
marry
an
outcast
slave
like
me
one
morning
i
found
robes
of
pure
white
in
my
humble
shed
in
which
proceeded
to
array
me
after
which
she
brought
me
into
the
presence
of
the
moolah
mohammedan
priest
the
merchant
and
a
few
trusty
friends
the
moolah
quietly
put
down
his
hookah
pipe
stood
up
and
putting
his
hands
before
his
face
uttered
a
short
prayer
after
this
he
took
the
end
of
my
saree
scarf
and
bound
it
securely
to
the
end
of
the
merchant
angrakah
coat
gave
us
water
in
which
had
been
dipped
the
myrtle
and
jessamine
flower
placed
a
ring
of
gold
on
my
finger
blessed
us
and
departed
that
was
our
marriage
ceremony
during
all
the
days
that
followed
i
moved
about
as
one
drunk
with
strong
wine
i
enjoyed
every
moment
i
thanked
god
for
the
sun
the
beautiful
summer
days
the
radiant
yellow
sky
the
fresh
dawn
and
the
dewy
eve
light
pure
light
shone
upon
me
and
filled
my
soul
with
intense
delight
and
it
blossomed
out
into
the
perfect
flower
of
happiness
one
day
about
three
or
four
months
after
my
marriage
as
i
was
seated
on
the
steps
of
my
home
i
thought
i
heard
a
voice
whisper
in
my
ear
i
had
hardly
time
to
turn
when
i
was
seized
gagged
bound
hand
and
foot
and
brought
back
to
this
place
as
soon
as
i
was
taken
into
her
presence
my
mistress
had
me
chained
to
this
post
but
caused
me
to
be
released
when
my
time
of
delivery
approached
a
month
after
his
birth
pointing
to
the
sleeping
boy
i
was
chained
here
again
and
my
child
was
brought
to
me
to
nurse
this
was
done
until
he
could
come
to
me
alone
but
they
are
not
unkind
when
it
is
very
wet
the
takes
him
to
sleep
under
the
shelter
of
her
little
shed
i
could
free
myself
from
these
chains
if
i
would
promise
never
to
quit
the
palace
that
i
will
never
do
she
said
this
in
a
feeble
and
almost
inarticulate
voice
it
was
her
last
effort
to
speak
her
head
drooped
upon
her
breast
as
if
an
invisible
power
overwhelmed
her
at
a
blow
she
fell
exhausted
upon
the
stones
her
hands
clasped
her
face
buried
in
the
dust
it
was
a
strange
sight
and
possible
only
in
siam
certainly
great
misfortunes
as
well
as
great
affections
develop
the
intelligence
else
how
had
this
reached
the
elevation
to
which
she
had
evidently
attained
but
excess
of
sorrow
had
made
her
almost
visionary
when
i
tried
to
comfort
her
she
turned
her
haggard
face
with
its
weary
look
upon
me
and
asked
if
she
had
been
dreaming
her
brain
seemed
to
be
in
such
an
abnormal
yet
frightfully
calm
condition
that
she
half
believed
she
was
in
a
dream
and
that
her
life
was
not
a
frightful
reality
it
was
out
of
my
power
to
comfort
her
but
i
left
her
with
a
hope
that
grew
brighter
as
i
retraced
my
steps
out
of
that
weird
place
after
some
tiresome
wanderings
i
found
my
way
out
of
the
place
at
last
when
i
reached
the
it
was
twelve
and
my
pupils
were
waiting
in
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
i
went
to
the
house
of
the
naikodah
ibrahim
and
told
him
that
i
had
seen
his
wife
and
child
he
was
much
affected
when
he
heard
they
were
still
alive
and
was
moved
to
tears
when
i
told
him
of
their
sad
condition
that
night
a
deputation
of
mohammedans
headed
by
the
moolah
hâdjee
bâbâ
waited
upon
me
we
drew
up
a
petition
to
the
king
after
which
i
retired
thankful
that
i
was
not
a
siamese

liberty
to
do
an
inquiry
for
the
matter
complained
to
hear
from
the
princess
ong
brittry
the
daughter
of
the
chow
chom
manda
ung
who
is
now
absent
from
hence
the
princess
said
that
she
knows
nothing
about
the
wife
of
naikodah
but
that
certain
children
were
sent
her
from
her
grandfather
maternal
that
they
are
offspring
of
his
and
that
these
children
shall
be
in
her
employment
so
i
ought
to
see
the
chow
chom
manda
ung
and
inquire
from
herself
maha
mongkut
rx
his
majesty
was
as
good
as
his
word
and
when
the
chow
chom
manda
ung
returned
he
ordered
the
chief
of
the
female
judges
of
the
palace
her
ladyship
khoon
thow
app
to
investigate
the
matter
khoon
thow
app
was
a
tall
stout
dark
woman
with
soft
eyes
but
rather
a
heavy
face
her
only
beauty
being
in
her
hands
and
arms
which
were
remarkably
well
formed
she
was
religious
and
scrupulously
just
had
a
serious
and
concentrated
bearing
everything
she
said
or
did
was
studied
not
for
effect
but
from
discretion
a
certain
air
of
preoccupation
was
natural
to
her
she
knew
everything
that
took
place
in
the
harem
and
concealed
everything
within
her
own
breast
by
dint
of
attention
and
penetration
she
had
attained
to
her
high
office
and
she
retained
it
by
virtue
of
her
supreme
but
unassuming
fitness
for
the
position
she
was
like
a
deaf
person
whose
sight
is
quickened
and
like
one
blind
whose
sense
of
hearing
is
intensified
that
hideous
symbolical
sphinx
with
a
sword
drawn
through
her
mouth
babbled
all
her
secrets
and
sorrows
in
her
ear
she
inspired
confidence
and
she
never
decided
a
case
in
private
she
lived
alone
in
a
small
house
at
the
end
of
the
street
with
only
four
faithful
female
slaves
the
rest
she
had
freed
it
was
before
this
woman
that
by
order
of
the
king
i
brought
my
complaint
in
behalf
of
she
raised
her
eyes
from
her
book
or
rather
roll
and
said
ah
it
is
you
mam
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
and
for
my
part
said
i
with
a
boldness
at
which
i
was
myself
astonished
i
have
something
to
say
to
your
ladyship
o
i
know
that
you
have
a
communication
to
make
which
has
already
been
laid
before
his
majesty
your
petition
is
granted
how
said
i
is
really
free
to
leave
the
palace
o
no
but
his
majesty
letter
is
of
such
a
character
that
we
have
the
power
to
proceed
in
this
matter
against
the
chow
chom
manda
ung
though
we
are
said
to
have
the
right
to
compel
any
woman
in
the
palace
to
come
before
us
these
great
ladies
will
not
appear
personally
but
send
all
manner
of
frivolous
excuses
unless
summoned
by
a
royal
mandate
such
as
this
she
then
turned
to
one
of
the
female
sheriffs
and
despatched
her
for
the
chow
chom
manda
ung
ong
brittry
and
the
after
a
delay
of
nearly
two
hours
chow
chom
manda
ung
and
her
daughter
the
princess
ong
brittry
made
their
appearance
accompanied
by
an
immense
retinue
of
female
slaves
bearing
a
host
of
luxurious
appendages
for
their
royal
mistresses
comfort
during
the
trial
with
the
sheriff
bending
low
and
following
this
grand
procession
at
a
respectful
distance
the
great
ladies
took
their
places
on
the
velvet
cushions
placed
for
them
by
their
slaves
with
an
air
of
authority
and
rebellion
combined
as
if
to
say
who
is
there
here
to
constrain
us
the
chief
judge
adjusted
her
spectacles
and
as
she
looked
fixedly
at
the
great
ladies
she
asked
where
is
the
the
old
dowager
cast
a
malicious
glance
at
the
judge
but
there
was
still
the
same
silence
the
same
air
of
defiance
of
all
authority
all
round
the
open
sala
or
hall
was
collected
a
ragged
rabble
of
slave
women
and
children
crouching
in
all
sorts
of
attitudes
and
all
sorts
of
costumes
but
with
eyes
fixed
on
the
chief
judge
in
startled
astonishment
and
wonder
at
her
calm
unmovable
countenance
superciliousness
and
apparent
contempt
prevailed
everywhere
yet
in
the
midst
of
all
the
consciousness
of
an
austere
and
august
presence
was
evident
for
not
one
of
those
lowly
untaught
and
half
clad
as
they
were
but
felt
that
in
the
heart
of
that
dark
stern
woman
before
them
there
was
as
great
a
respect
for
the
rights
of
the
meanest
among
them
as
for
those
of
the
queen
dowager
herself
the
chief
judge
then
read
aloud
in
a
clear
voice
the
letter
she
had
received
from
the
king
and
when
it
was
finished
the
dowager
and
her
daughter
saluted
the
letter
by
prostrating
themselves
three
times
before
it
then
the
judge
inquired
if
the
august
ladies
had
aught
to
say
why
the
should
not
have
been
emancipated
when
she
offered
to
pay
the
full
price
of
her
freedom
the
attention
of
all
was
excited
to
the
highest
degree
every
eye
concentrated
itself
on
the
queen
dowager
she
spoke
with
difficulty
and
answered
with
some
embarrassment
but
from
head
to
foot
her
whole
person
defied
the
judge
and
what
if
every
slave
in
my
service
should
bring
me
the
price
of
her
freedom
all
eyes
turned
again
to
the
judge
seated
so
calmly
there
on
her
little
strip
of
matting
every
ear
was
strained
to
catch
her
reply
then
lady
thou
wouldst
be
bound
to
free
every
one
of
them
and
serve
myself
even
so
my
august
mistress
said
the
judge
bowing
low
the
dowager
turned
very
pale
and
trembled
slightly
as
the
judge
declared
that
was
no
longer
the
slave
of
the
chow
chom
manda
ung
but
the
property
of
the
crue
yai
royal
teacher
let
her
be
paid
down
said
the
dowager
angrily
and
she
is
freed
forever
from
my
service
the
judge
then
turned
to
me
and
said
you
are
now
the
mistress
of
i
will
have
the
papers
made
out
bring
hither
the
money
forty
ticals
and
all
shall
be
settled
i
thanked
the
judge
bowed
to
the
great
ladies
who
simply
ignored
my
existence
and
returned
perfectly
happy
for
once
in
my
life
to
my
home
in
bangkok
next
day
after
school
i
presented
myself
at
the
only
three
of
the
female
judges
were
present
with
some
of
the
khooms
sheriffs
khoon
thow
app
handed
me
the
dekah
or
free
paper
and
bade
one
of
the
khooms
go
with
me
to
see
the
money
paid
and
liberated
never
did
my
feet
move
so
swiftly
as
when
i
threaded
once
more
the
narrow
alley
and
my
heart
beat
quickly
as
i
pushed
open
the
ponderous
brass
door
there
was
chained
as
before
in
the
piazza
sat
the
princess
ong
brittry
and
her
mother
surrounded
by
their
sympathizing
women
the
khoom
was
so
timid
and
hesitating
that
i
advanced
and
laid
the
money
before
the
great
ladies
the
queen
dowager
dashed
the
money
away
and
sent
it
rolling
hither
and
thither
on
the
pavement
but
gave
orders
at
the
same
time
to
release
and
let
her
go
this
was
done
by
a
female
blacksmith
a
dark
heavy
woman
who
filed
the
rivet
asunder
in
the
mean
time
a
crowd
had
collected
in
this
solitary
place
chiefly
ladies
of
the
harem
with
some
few
slaves
so
was
free
at
last
but
what
was
my
amazement
to
find
that
she
refused
to
move
she
persistently
folded
her
hands
and
remained
prostrate
before
her
royal
persecutors
as
if
rooted
to
the
spot
i
was
troubled
i
turned
to
consult
the
khoom
but
she
did
not
dare
to
advise
me
when
one
of
the
ladies
a
mother
with
a
babe
in
her
arms
whispered
in
my
ear
they
have
taken
away
the
child
alas
i
had
forgotten
the
child
the
faces
of
the
crowd
were
marked
with
sympathy
and
sadness
they
exchanged
glances
and
the
same
woman
whispered
to
me
go
back
go
back
and
demand
to
buy
the
child
i
turned
away
sorrowfully
hastened
to
khoon
thow
app
and
stated
my
case
she
opened
a
box
drew
out
a
dark
roll
and
set
out
with
me
the
scene
was
just
as
i
had
left
it
there
sat
the
august
ladies
holding
small
jewelled
and
creaming
their
lips
with
the
most
sublime
air
of
indifference
still
lay
prostrate
before
them
her
face
hidden
on
the
pavement
the
crowd
of
women
pressed
anxiously
in
and
all
eyes
were
strained
towards
the
judge
she
bowed
before
the
ladies
opened
the
dark
roll
and
read
the
law
if
any
woman
have
children
during
her
bondage
they
shall
be
slaves
also
and
she
is
bound
to
pay
for
their
freedom
as
well
as
her
own
the
price
of
an
infant
in
arms
is
one
tical
and
for
every
year
of
his
or
her
life
shall
be
paid
one
tical
this
declaration
in
terms
so
precise
appeared
to
produce
a
strong
impression
on
the
crowd
and
none
whatever
on
the
royal
ladies
ever
so
many
were
opened
and
the
price
of
the
child
pressed
upon
me
i
took
four
ticals
and
laid
them
down
before
the
ladies
the
judge
seeing
that
nothing
was
done
to
bring
the
child
to
the
prostrate
mother
despatched
one
of
the
khooms
for
the
boy
in
half
an
hour
he
was
in
his
mother
arms
she
did
not
start
with
surprise
or
joy
but
turned
up
to
heaven
a
face
that
was
joy
itself
both
mother
and
child
bowed
before
the
great
ladies
then
made
strenuous
efforts
to
stand
up
and
walk
and
failing
began
to
laugh
at
her
own
awkwardness
as
she
limped
and
hobbled
along
borne
away
by
the
exulting
crowd
headed
by
the
judge
even
this
did
not
diminish
her
happiness
with
her
face
pressed
close
to
her
boy
she
continued
to
talk
to
herself
and
to
him
how
happy
we
shall
be
we
too
have
a
little
garden
in
thy
father

my

play
in
the

will
chase

in
the
grass
and
i
will
watch

all

the
keepers
of
the
gates
handed
flowers
to
the
boy

before

hosts
of
malays
mohammedans

siamese
with
some
few

had
loosened
their
cumberbunds

converted
them
into

with

running
and

crowding
into

full
of

every

crowds
of
men
and
boys
are
pouring
into
the

from

parts
of

to
have
their
names
enrolled
on
the
books
of
the
lords
and
dukes
to
whom
they
belong
there
are
no
railroads
no
steamboats
so
the
vast
companies
of
serfs
travel
together
the
rich
by
means
of
their
boats
and
gondolas
and
the
poor
on

following
the
course
of
the

sometimes
caravans
of

be
seen
encamped
during
the
intense
noonday
heat
by
the
banks
of
the
stream
under
the
shade
of
some
neighboring
trees
these
weary
marches
are
always
commenced
at
sunset
and
continued
till
noon
of
the
next
day
when
the
overpowering
heat
forces

under

there
existed
in

under

a
mixed
system
of
slavery
in

the
old

of

feudal

the

every
man
is

to
receive
an
indelible
mark
on
his

or
side
denoting
the
chief
to
whom
he
belongs
the
process
is
exactly

the

pricked
into

from

or
lords
of
the
realm
among
the
vast
crowds
who
were
pouring
through
the
many
gates
and
avenues
into
the
city
in
july
was
seen
a
stately
old
rajpoot
weary
and
leading
a
shaggy
pony
on
which
was
seated
a
closely
veiled
figure
of
a
young
woman
a
stranger
could
not
but
observe
the
proud
forbidding
look
of
the
old
man
as
he
urged
and
stimulated
his
weary
beast
through
the
crowd
behind
the
veiled
figure
were
two
leathern
bags
which
contained
some
wearing
apparel
and
a
supply
of
provisions
to
serve
them
during
their
stay
in
the
capital
there
are
no
such
places
as
inns
or
caravansaries
to
lodge
the
multitude
who
are
thus
forced
into
bangkok
every
year
those
who
have
boats
live
in
them
on
the
river
and
its
numerous
canals
others
take
refuge
in
the
buddhist
monasteries
while
the
poorer
classes
have
the
bare
earth
dry
or
wet
as
the
weather
may
be
for
their
couch
it
was
not
until
they
were
quite
exhausted
and
could
no
longer
maintain
the
pace
at
which
they
had
been
making
their
way
through
the
crowded
city
that
the
old
man
began
to
look
around
him
for
some
spot
where
they
could
encamp
the
place
at
which
they
had
arrived
was
the
southern
gate
of
the
citadel
called
patoo
song
khai
gate
of
commerce
here
they
came
upon
the
haunts
of
commerce
and
traffic
market
and
tradeswomen
were
hurrying
to
and
from
the
inner
city
all
around
was
noise
and
confusion
and
here
beneath
the
shadow
of
a
projecting
porch
and
wall
the
old
man
suddenly
halted
and
lifting
the
girl
lightly
to
the
ground
said
in
a
low
deep
and
not
unmusical
voice
let
us
abide
here
my
child
and
though
we
can
call
nothing
our
own
we
shall
live
like
the
bright
gods
feeding
on
happiness
there
was
something
tender
in
the
way
he
said
this
but
the
girl
did
not
appear
to
heed
him
looking
about
her
with
a
startled
and
bewildered
gaze
she
seemed
to
be
haunted
by
apprehensions
of
being
led
captive
to
some
gloomy
place
where
she
would
be
chained
and
scourged
and
worse
than
all
where
she
would
never
see
her
father
but
through
iron
gratings
and
bars
her
terrors
at
length
became
so
real
that
she
wrapped
her
faded
saree
more
closely
around
her
and
burst
into
tears
art
thou
afraid
inquired
the
old
man
why
thou
hast
less
to
fear
here
by
my
side
than
if
i
had
left
thee
behind
in
the
mountains
of
prabat
he
then
proceeded
to
unpack
his
beast
while
the
girl
timidly
made
ready
to
cook
their
evening
meal
of
boiled
rice
and
fish
there
was
a
certain
sense
of
safety
in
the
shadow
of
the
grand
royal
palace
that
seemed
to
restore
the
girl
to
a
state
of
moderate
tranquillity
and
the
amazons
who
loitered
round
the
gate
watched
the
travellers
with
some
degree
of
interest
which
arose
partly
from
curiosity
and
partly
from
want
of
something
better
to
do
the
old
man
seemed
a
sombre
sort
of
being
to
them
but
the
girl
was
an
object
of
wonder
and
delight
as
though
she
replied
to
her
father
in
a
language
foreign
to
the
listeners
she
frequently
intermingled
her
remarks
with
the
siamese
word
cha
dear
which
pleased
the
guardians
of
the
gate
so
much
that
they
made
no
objections
to
the
travellers
resting
there
in
such
a
spot
as
this
there
was
indeed
more
of
danger
than
of
safety
both
for
father
and
child
if
they
could
but
have
known
it
but
the
poorer
class
of
strangers
clung
to
the
name
of
the
great
king
maha
mongkut
as
a
babe
clings
to
its
mother
arms
and
the
old
man
felt
as
safe
as
if
lodged
in
an
impregnable
castle
surrounded
by
a
million
of
guardian
angels
while
the
girl
gathering
courage
from
the
satisfaction
that
settled
on
her
father
face
began
to
take
note
of
what
was
passing
around
her
and
her
fears
soon
gave
place
to
a
variety
of
happy
thoughts
the
freshness
of
the
evening
air
the
song
of
the
merry
birds
the
beauty
of
the
wild
flowers
that
grew
among
the
tangled
bushes
on
the
banks
of
the
river
and
above
all
the
constant
stream
of
richly
gilded
boats
and
gondolas
that
glided
past
on
the
limpid
waters
now
glittering
in
the
roseate
hues
of
the
setting
sun
soothed
and
gladdened
as
with
tender
loving
words
the
heart
of
the
lonely
mountain
girl
at
sunset
the
amazons
shut
the
gates
and
disappeared
the
old
man
unrolled
a
small
carpet
covered
himself
with
a
old
cloth
and
taking
his
daughter
under
his
stalwart
arm
he
laid
himself
down
to
rest
beneath
the
canopy
of
the
wide
sky
the
girl
from
her
place
near
the
corner
made
by
the
gate
and
the
wall
could
only
see
one
star
overhead
and
the
shadow
in
which
she
slept
seemed
so
dark
that
her
heart
sunk
within
her
as
she
silently
prayed
to
the
angel
of
the
sky
not
to
desert
them
but
tired
and
weary
she
soon
slept
as
soundly
as
her
father
meanwhile
the
city
of
the
invincible
and
beautiful
archangel
slumbered
and
the
great
stars
globed
themselves
in
heaven
and
seemed
to
bridge
the
gulf
that
separates
the
infinite
from
the
finite
with
their
tender
loving
light
who
can
say
but
that
the
fond
spirit
of
a
dead
wife
and
mother
beamed
in
love
and
pity
over
the
father
and
child
sleeping
thus
alone
in
the
heart
of
a
great
city
for
the
girl
dreamed
a
dream
which
seemed
a
warning
to
her
suddenly
she
started
in
her
sleep
and
saw
in
the
distance
a
company
of
men
armed
with
swords
and
spears
carrying
lanterns
in
their
hands
marching
slowly
towards
the
spot
where
they
lay
these
were
the
patrolling
outside
the
walls
of
the
inner
city
while
she
looked
they
seemed
to
expand
they
were
now
colossal
monsters
that
filled
the
earth
air
and
sky
full
of
dismay
she
clung
closer
to
the
side
of
her
father
their
heavy
tramp
came
nearer
and
she
could
hear
them
stop
how
desperately
her
heart
beat
under
the
covering
what
if
they
should
find
her
out
the
captain
of
the
guards
approached
passed
his
lantern
slowly
over
the
face
of
the
old
man
and
perceiving
that
he
was
one
of
the
many
strangers
called
into
the
city
at
this
time
of
the
year
he
and
his
company
went
on
their
rounds
no
sooner
had
the
glimmer
of
their
lanterns
vanished
in
the
distance
than
the
girl
sprang
up
and
casting
a
cautious
glance
all
round
drew
out
in
the
darkness
a
small
brass
image
of
indra
which
she
wore
within
her
vest
and
placed
it
at
her
father
head
then
loosening
a
silk
cord
from
her
neck
to
which
was
attached
a
silver
ring
inscribed
with
the
mystic
triform
used
by
the
hindoo
women
she
proceeded
to
implore
the
protection
of
the
gods
and
to
describe
several
weird
circles
and
waves
over
herself
and
her
father
this
done
she
slept
sweetly
feeling
in
the
presence
of
that
brass
image
a
sense
of
security
that
many
a
christian
might
have
envied
just
at
this
moment
one
of
the
guards
in
passing
on
the
other
side
of
the
city
remarked
that
they
ought
to
have
aroused
the
old
khaik
foreigner
and
exacted
a
toll
from
him
for
taking
up
his
quarters
so
near
the
walls
of
the
royal
palace
that
very
thought
has
just
crossed
my
mind
said
the
captain
and
mine
and
mine
echoed
a
number
of
voices
it
is
hardly
midnight
yet
let
us
turn
back
and
see
what
we
can
squeeze
out
of
the
old
fellow
no
sooner
said
than
done
the
chief
led
the
way
and
the
whole
company
rapidly
retraced
their
steps
to
where
the
travellers
slept
it
would
be
difficult
to
reproduce
the
picture
that
must
have
presented
itself
to
the
captain
of
the
who
after
having
stationed
his
men
at
a
little
distance
advanced
noiselessly
approached
the
old
man
and
drew
off
lightly
the
covering
that
wrapped
the
sleeper
in
order
to
make
some
guess
from
his
dress
and
appearance
as
to
the
amount
of
money
they
might
demand
from
him
the
eye
turns
instinctively
to
the
faintest
glimmer
of
light
so
the
light
reflected
from
the
calm
face
of
the
mysteriously
beautiful
dreamer
as
she
lay
beside
her
father
her
head
resting
on
his
arm
and
her
face
turned
mutely
up
to
the
dark
sky
staggered
the
captain
who
started
back
as
if
he
had
received
a
sudden
blow
or
as
if
some
unexpected
event
had
forced
him
into
the
presence
of
a
supernatural
being
while
the
brazen
image
of
indra
gleamed
with
a
lurid
brightness
that
reddened
the
pale
atmosphere
around
as
if
in
the
vicinity
of
some
conflagration
buddhist
as
he
was
he
had
a
sort
of
ancestral
reverence
for
the
gods
of
the
hindoos
he
also
believed
in
the
ancient
tradition
that
no
one
could
injure
the
innocent
the
shadow
of
the
shade
grew
darker
and
he
thought
the
eyes
of
the
god
were
fixed
intently
upon
him
all
his
unrighteous
desires
quelled
he
stood
transfixed
reverently
to
the
spot
a
serious
smile
almost
stern
in
its
expression
passed
over
the
girl
face
as
he
stood
contemplating
her
that
seemingly
slumbering
statue
was
conscious
of
an
intruder
and
she
quietly
opened
her
eyes
on
him
the
captain
lantern
lighted
up
his
face
and
fearless
man
that
he
was
he
trembled
as
he
met
that
calm
inquiring
look
but
before
he
could
retire
or
bring
himself
to
speak
the
girl
uttered
a
sudden
cry
of
terror
so
pathetic
and
terrible
that
the
old
man
sprang
to
his
feet
and
the
guards
who
heard
it
in
the
distance
felt
their
blood
run
cold
with
horror
and
dismay
there
was
a
moment
of
hesitation
as
the
old
rajpoot
confronted
the
guardsman
face
to
face
the
next
instant
the
lantern
was
dashed
from
his
trembling
hand
and
he
lay
prostrate
on
the
ground
while
his
enemy
grappled
at
his
throat
with
the
fury
of
a
wild
beast
the
remainder
of
the
guards
rushed
to
the
scene
of
conflict
but
even
they
stood
confounded
for
a
second
or
two
at
the
sight
of
the
strange
terrified
girl
they
soon
recovered
from
their
astonishment
however
and
proceeded
to
capture
the
old
man
when
smâyâtee
sprang
to
her
feet
at
once
like
some
spectre
rising
from
the
ground
and
pushing
back
the
soldiers
with
all
her
might
clasped
her
father
round
the
neck
thus
clinging
to
him
she
turned
a
face
of
defiance
on
the
guardsmen
of
the
king
the
aspect
of
the
girl
who
thought
to
restrain
by
an
electric
glance
an
armed
force
excited
such
derision
in
the
breasts
of
the
soldiers
that
they
rudely
tore
her
from
her
father
bound
her
with
the
silken
that
had
served
for
her
pony
and
carried
them
both
off
to
separate
cells
while
a
party
of
them
remained
behind
to
restore
their
fallen
chief
chapter
viii
among
the
hills
of
orissa
before
proceeding
further
it
will
not
be
amiss
to
give
the
reader
some
account
of
this
rajpoot
and
his
daughter
and
that
he
may
better
understand
the
personal
anecdotes
of
bravery
honest
zeal
and
devotedness
that
distinguished
him
in
life
i
must
turn
to
the
still
broader
and
deeper
historical
incidents
which
are
the
marked
characteristics
of
the
race
to
which
he
belonged
i
do
not
undertake
to
treat
of
this
portion
of
india
at
large
but
only
to
look
at
the
small
corner
of
it
in
which
rama
the
rajpoot
was
born
in
the
district
of
orissa
stands
on
a
cluster
of
hills
in
the
midst
of
an
arid
and
undulating
plateau
the
city
of
megara
composed
for
the
most
part
of
houses
of
mean
aspect
with
only
a
few
handsome
mansions
and
stately
edifices
to
relieve
their
monotonous
insignificance
possessing
few
fine
trees
large
enough
to
afford
shade
with
the
exception
of
the
sacred
groves
dedicated
to
the
dâvee
and
the
dhupyâ
and
with
water
barely
sufficient
to
quench
the
excessive
thirst
of
its
parched
inhabitants
alternately
swept
by
piercing
blasts
and
scorched
by
intense
heats
megara
would
certainly
present
but
few
attractions
to
the
traveller
but
for
the
mysterious
reverence
which
has
rested
ever
since
the
time
of
alexander
over
the
illimitable
plains
of
hindostan
tragic
and
terrible
are
the
memories
that
poetry
has
woven
about
this
land
of
undefined
distances
and
nearly
fabulous
magnificence
where
men
adopt
from
father
to
son
the
professions
of
murderers
highwaymen
robbers
soldiers
warriors
and
priests
where
each
man
lives
as
if
surrounded
by
internal
and
external
enemies
and
expects
from
every
circling
point
of
the
horizon
a
foeman
instead
of
a
friend
from
the
remotest
times
there
has
been
a
ceaseless
march
of
tribes
into
this
vast
peninsula
from
which
there
is
no
outlet
pouring
across
the
indus
or
straggling
down
through
the
passes
of
the
himalaya
each
wave
of
immigration
pushed
its
predecessors
farther
into
the
country
thus
the
aryan
nations
followed
in
their
turn
at
the
same
time
reacting
powerfully
on
the
creeds
and
usages
of
the
primitive
people
but
various
remains
of
the
earlier
and
rude
aboriginal
tribes
are
still
found
here
among
the
hilly
regions
and
woody
fastnesses
of
the
peninsula
many
of
them
are
quite
distinct
from
one
another
evidently
belonging
to
different
eras
of
an
indefinitely
remote
and
abysmal
past
the
rajpoots
are
the
most
remarkable
of
these
aboriginal
tribes
and
they
are
described
as
a
noble
race
tall
and
athletic
with
symmetric
features
between
the
roman
and
jewish
types
large
eyed
and
with
fine
long
hair
falling
in
natural
locks
upon
their
shoulders
though
with
the
decline
of
their
country
under
british
rule
the
decline
of
their
character
has
kept
pace
revolutions
have
done
their
work
upon
them
if
indeed
the
word
revolution
may
be
applied
to
the
insurrections
and
mutinies
that
have
kept
this
portion
of
india
in
a
state
of
petty
warfare
for
the
last
three
hundred
years
the
comparatively
treeless
character
of
the
hills
where
they
dwell
appears
to
indicate
that
in
former
times
large
spaces
had
been
laid
under
cultivation
whereas
at
present
they
lead
a
savage
life
as
freebooters
and
robbers
around
these
desolate
hills
and
valleys
cluster
a
variety
of
tribes
and
races
of
diverse
tongues
and
customs
creeds
and
religions
worshippers
of
mohammed
and
of
the
buddha
followers
of
brahma
and
of
indra
of
vishnu
and
siva
of
the
and
teeming
dâvee
and
the
and
dhupyâ
over
all
these
different
peoples
the
rajpoot
or
warrior
caste
has
held
for
centuries
an
undisputed
sway
among
all
these
tribes
the
meriâh
sacrifice
prevails
as
the
only
means
of
propitiating
the
the
victims
for
these
yearly
sacrifices
are
furnished
by
a
regular
class
of
procurers
who
either
supply
them
to
order
or
raise
them
on
speculation
they
are
bought
from
their
parents
in
hard
famine
times
or
they
are
kidnapped
on
the
plains
devoted
often
in
their
childhood
to
the
dâvee
they
are
suffered
to
grow
up
as
consecrated
privileged
beings
to
marry
to
hold
lands
and
flocks
and
herds
and
other
worldly
goods
and
are
cherished
and
beloved
by
the
community
for
whom
they
are
willing
to
be
offered
up
to
serve
as
mediator
and
friend
in
the
shadowy
world
beyond
the
grave
for
the
short
space
of
one
year
when
the
insatiable
is
said
to
demand
a
fresh
victim
i
ought
not
to
omit
to
say
here
as
a
faithful
recorder
of
the
facts
that
have
reached
me
that
in
spite
of
the
tremendous
doom
that
overshadows
the
victims
consecrated
to
dâvee
altar
they
lead
resigned
and
even
joyous
lives
up
to
the
last
moment
of
their
existence
and
the
saying
is
that
the
soul
of
a
god
enters
the
martyr
and
transfigures
him
into
a
divine
ineffable
being
incapable
of
feeling
any
pain
or
regret
at
the
moment
of
death
for
unnumbered
centuries
the
vast
hilly
province
of
orissa
verging
on
gondwana
and
comprising
all
the
eastern
portion
of
the
vindhya
chain
has
been
the
scene
of
this
revolting
and
inhuman
custom
and
from
time
immemorial
thousands
of
men
whom
we
in
our
enlightenment
call
savage
hordes
have
offered
themselves
up
for
the
good
of
their
surely
an
effluence
from
the
divine
soul
must
have
passed
over
these
strange
mystic
mediators
as
they
stood
trembling
upon
dâvee
altar
clutching
the
sharp
knife
in
their
uplifted
hand
their
faces
turned
towards
the
darkening
earth
singing
the
supreme
song
and
uttering
the
supreme
cry
o
dâvee
do
all
thy
acts
to
me
spend
all
thy
fury
upon
me
spare
my
race
from
the
hungry
grave
earth
drink
of
my
blood
and
be
appeased
and
as
the
echoes
of
this
cry
of
triumph
and
of
despair
die
away
in
the
distance
the
victim
plunges
the
bright
steel
into
his
own
warm
heart
bends
forward
to
sprinkle
with
his
life
blood
the
insatiable
earth
repeating
his
song
in
whispers
that
grow
fainter
and
fainter
as
he
slowly
draws
out
the
fatal
steel
and
falls
dead
upon
her
bare
bosom
the
rajpoots
are
still
the
chiefs
they
levy
a
tax
on
the
various
tribes
who
inhabit
these
hilly
regions
and
who
are
in
great
measure
dependent
upon
them
trained
warriors
from
their
childhood
for
their
protection
they
are
not
distinct
from
their
neighbors
so
far
as
the
ceremonials
of
religion
are
concerned
the
number
of
marriages
among
them
is
however
contracted
by
the
exclusion
of
all
but
their
own
peculiar
clan
or
caste
marriage
itself
is
an
expensive
thing
from
the
costly
usages
with
which
it
is
attended
among
them
while
at
the
same
time
celibacy
is
disgraceful
an
unmarried
daughter
is
a
reproach
to
her
parents
and
to
herself
therefore
it
has
been
an
established
custom
with
the
rajpoot
to
preserve
the
chastity
of
his
daughter
and
the
honor
of
his
house
by
doing
away
with
his
female
children
a
few
hours
after
their
birth
when
a
messenger
from
the
zennânâ
announces
to
him
the
birth
of
a
daughter
the
rajpoot
will
coolly
roll
up
between
his
fingers
a
tiny
ball
of
opium
to
be
conveyed
to
the
mother
who
thereupon
with
many
a
bitter
tear
rubs
on
her
nipple
the
poison
and
the
babe
drinks
in
death
with
its
mother
milk
here
again
we
find
a
striking
anomaly
in
the
hindoo
character
the
parental
instinct
is
as
strong
in
the
people
of
india
as
in
any
people
of
the
world
and
even
where
no
parental
tie
exists
the
tenderness
with
which
strong
bearded
men
devote
themselves
to
the
care
of
young
children
is
as
touching
as
it
is
remarkable
a
childless
woman
too
is
a
miserable
creature
a
hissing
and
a
reproach
among
men
and
barrenness
is
only
accounted
for
as
a
punishment
for
some
grievous
sin
committed
against
the
gods
in
a
state
nevertheless
among
the
rajpoot
tribes
female
infanticide
is
universally
practised
so
that
in
the
district
in
which
rama
was
born
owing
to
its
decline
from
the
prosperity
of
former
years
a
girl
was
rarely
if
ever
heard
of
on
a
high
and
projecting
rock
whose
scarped
and
rugged
outlines
bid
defiance
to
the
pedestrian
stood
the
stately
mansion
of
dhotee
bhad
the

and
solitary
spot

it
had
two
advantages
it
was
almost
inaccessible

it

were

profound
brown
shadows
and
lurid
gloom

to

such
was
the
home
and
the
birthplace
of
our
hero
rama
chapter
ix
the
rebel
duke
si
in
the
year
a
revolutionary
war
broke
out
in
the
northern
provinces
of
siam
the
ringleader
of
this
disaffected
part
of
the
country
was
the
duke
si
a
man
who
from
his
high
position
great
warlike
talents
and
immense
wealth
possessed
an
unbounded
influence
over
the
inhabitants
of
the
northern
provinces
it
is
said
that
even
from
his
infancy
the
demon
ambition
had
taken
such
possession
of
him
that
he
used
to
imagine
himself
a
king
and
that
from
that
time
to
the
fatal
termination
of
his
life
he
dreamt
of
nothing
but
the
sceptre
and
the
supreme
sway
it
was
one
of
his
first
efforts
therefore
to
gather
from
distant
lands
all
the
disaffected
and
ambitious
spirits
he
could
muster
together
men
who
would
be
brave
and
skilful
enough
to
take
the
helm
in
the
storm
that
must
follow
his
inexorable
bidding
in
he
sent
secret
agents
by
an
indian
merchant
ship
to
calcutta
to
enlist
for
him
a
troop
of
hardy
warriors
of
the
rajpoot
tribe
among
this
troop
hired
in
calcutta
and
transshipped
to
siam
was
our
prisoner
rama
singalee
rama
the
lion
he
with
the
rest
of
his
party
had
been
implicated
in
some
incipient
rebellion
against
the
british
government
and
had
fled
for
concealment
to
the
densely
populated
city
of
calcutta
where
after
several
years
of
hard
struggling
to
obtain
some
means
of
livelihood
not
derogatory
to
their
high
caste
they
were
induced
to
sell
their
services
to
the
agent
of
the
duke
si
this
band
of
hired
mercenaries
landed
secretly
in
the
gulf
of
martaban
at
the
mouth
of
the
irrawady
whence
by
night
travel
they
arrived
at
batt
here
portions
of
land
in
the
tenure
of
the
duke
were
allotted
to
them
and
they
were
dispersed
until
a
fitting
opportunity
should
offer
for
striking
the
final
blow
which
was
to
place
their
master
on
the
throne
of
siam
and
themselves
in
offices
of
trust
in
the
kingdom
so
things
went
on
for
several
years
when
rama
fell
in
love
with
a
loatian
girl
of
singular
beauty
but
could
not
collect
money
enough
to
satisfy
the
demands
of
her
parents
it
was
the
custom
of
the
duke
si
to
make
an
annual
visit
to
batt
ostensibly
with
varied
offerings
to
the
footprint
of
buddha
from
which
the
whole
mountainous
district
is
named
but
in
reality
to
muster
his
retainers
give
them
presents
and
exact
fresh
promises
of
service
or
to
traverse
the
entire
country
gaining
fresh
adherents
to
his
cause
on
one
occasion
a
dreadful
fever
ravaged
his
party
many
of
them
had
to
be
left
at
the
different
monasteries
to
be
cared
for
while
rama
and
a
few
followers
only
accompanied
him
just
as
the
sun
was
setting
behind
the
mountains
rama
who
acted
as
pioneer
heard
the
sound
of
some
animal
in
the
thick
underwood
he
crept
quickly
back
motioned
his
companions
to
halt
and
advanced
alone
a
few
yards
from
him
he
saw
a
tiger
immovable
yet
stealthily
watching
his
opportunity
to
make
a
spring
night
was
fast
approaching
and
so
was
death
but
rama
drew
near
his
eyes
fixed
steadily
and
unfalteringly
on
those
of
the
beast
at
last
he
took
his
position
and
for
a
moment
or
two
they
glared
one
upon
the
other
then
in
the
distance
the
rest
of
the
party
breathless
their
hearts
beating
quickly
heard
the
dismal
roar
of
a
goaded
and
infuriate
animal
and
the
heavy
blows
of
a
their
terror
was
only
equalled
by
their
joy
when
they
saw
the
huge
creature
extended
before
them
in
death
the
duke
came
up
and
instantly
rewarded
the
brave
warrior
with
a
hundred
pieces
of
gold
gold
enough
to
buy
malee
the
beautiful
loatian
girl
next
morning
he
prostrated
himself
before
the
duke
and
requested
permission
to
return
at
once
to
batt
which
was
granted
him
thus
did
the
rajpoot
obtain
to
wife
the
woman
he
loved
meanwhile
the
duke
still
cherishing
his
darling
ambition
consulted
all
the
astrologers
in
the
country
who
drew
auguries
from
ants
spiders
and
bees
and
predicted
for
him
a
brilliant
career
this
so
worked
upon
the
already
inflamed
imagination
of
si
that
he
was
led
in
an
unguarded
moment
to
throw
down
the
gauntlet
and
declare
open
war
against
the
king
of
siam
whom
he
branded
with
the
titles
of
fox
and
usurper
through
his
secret
emissaries
he
caused
edicts
to
be
proclaimed
everywhere
nominating
himself
in
the
name
of
the
people
and
of
heaven
as
the
lawful
successor
to
the
throne
the
entire
army
of
the
priesthood
and
the
people
were
on
his
side
hosts
of
men
from
all
parts
of
the
country
flocked
to
his
standard
the
duke
mounted
on
a
white
elephant
headed
the
rabble
crowd
before
him
on
horseback
rode
the
hired
rajpoot
band
of
warriors
tidings
of
this
alarming
insurrection
soon
reached
the
enraged
monarch
at
bangkok
who
instantly
summoned
a
council
of
war
and
sent
trumpeters
all
over
the
land
to
blast
forth
a
direful
malediction
in
the
name
of
all
the
hosts
of
heaven
upon
the
rebel
duke
and
his
followers
the
rebel
duke
and
his
frenzied
legions
made
rapid
progress
however
they
could
be
seen
covering
the
entire
face
of
the
country
rushing
on
with
shouts
and
cries
and
furious
bounding
of
elephants
and
horses
with
flourish
of
trumpets
and
of
banners
a
terrible
undisciplined
monster
being
neither
burnt
up
with
the
scorching
rays
of
suriya
nor
scattered
by
the
of
indra
the
king
who
had
stormed
so
loud
and
so
lustily
from
behind
the
of
his
throne
now
trembled
and
cowered
in
the
midst
of
his
fifteen
hundred
wives
and
let
the
duke
ride
triumphantly
almost
to
the
very
gates
of
his
palace
at
ayudia
in
this
emergency
the
prime
minister
somdetch
ong
yai
the
father
of
the
present
premier
assumed
the
command
of
the
army
transshipped
all
the
guns
he
could
muster
into
small
crafts
the
river
at
ayudia
being
too
shallow
for
ships
of
great
tonnage
taking
with
them
an
ample
supply
of
ammunition
and
with
hardly
twelve
thousand
men
sailed
up
the
river
amid
the
shouts
and
prayers
of
the
terrified
inhabitants
on
their
arrival
at
ayudia
the
guns
were
conveyed
on
trucks
to
the
point
whence
the
attack
was
expected
here
somdetch
ong
yai
hastily
erected
several
batteries
and
awaited
the
attack
scarcely
four
hours
had
elapsed
after
the
completion
of
these
preparations
when
the
whole
neighborhood
was
aroused
by
the
of
the
rebel
army
which
appeared
in
sight
headed
by
the
duke
the
rajpoot
cavalry
armed
with
long
bows
and
arrows
and
poisoned
lances
prepared
to
storm
the
batteries
there
was
a
moment
of
fearful
silence
followed
by
a
flash
and
the
thundering
roar
of
the
artillery
from
the
other
side
the
monster
army
of
the
rebel
duke
reeled
scattered
and
gave
way
all
but
the
rajpoot
cavalry
almost
every
one
of
whom
lay
dead
or
dying
on
the
field
the
prime
minister
somdetch
ong
yai
rushed
forward
and
captured
the
rebel
duke
wounding
in
the
attempt
one
gigantic
desperate
soldier
who
fought
with
a
recklessness
of
daring
in
behalf
of
his
misguided
leader
that
won
the
admiration
of
friend
and
foe
illustration
near
the
new
road
bangkok
where
was
the
monster
army
now
of
the
dead
and
dying
there
were
a
thousand
or
more
of
living
captives
only
two
the
duke

and
one
faithful
soldier
rama
singalee
the
rest
had
at
the
first
sound
of
the
cannon
fled
far
beyond
its
range
like
a
wave
of
the
ocean
it
had
swept
out
of
sight
si
was
carried
to
bangkok
tried
and
sentenced
to
death
a
general
amnesty
was
proclaimed
and
the
generous
premier
somdetch
ong
yai
took
rama
into
his
own
household
had
him
cared
for
and
promoted
to
a
place
of
trust
as
for
the
wretched
duke
on
his
arrival
at
bangkok
he
was
condemned
first
to
have
his
eyes
put
out
and
then
to
be
placed
in
an
iron
cage
which
was
suspended
from
a
scaffolding
in
the
middle
of
the
river
so
that
the
unfortunate
captive
could
manage
just
barely
to
touch
with
the
tips
of
his
fingers
the
waters
as
they
rippled
under
it
here
he
was
left
by
that
most
inhuman
of
the
kings
of
siam
klang
without
food
or
raiment
exposed
to
the
burning
heat
of
the
noonday
sun
to
suffer
from
the
acutest
agonies
of
thirst
within
hearing
and
touch
of
the
waters
that
flowed
in
perpetual
eddies
beneath
his
feet
how
ardently
must
that
poor
unhappy
man
have
prayed
for
death
and
that
dark
angel
at
all
times
too
ready
to
come
unbidden
to
the
good
and
happy
stood
aloof
and
seemed
to
mock
at
his
misery
for
many
and
many
a
weary
day
and
night
until
at
length
it
began
to
be
whispered
among
the
people
many
of
whom
would
gladly
have
brought
him
food
and
drink
but
for
the
dreadful
punishment
threatened
on
all
such
as
should
attempt
in
any
way
to
mitigate
his
tortures
that
the
angels
pitying
his
sufferings
brought
him
nightly
portions
of
the
amreeta
on
which
they
feed
so
plentifully
in
heaven
but
the
truth
was
that
rama
singalee
was
the
angel
who
battled
nightly
with
the
strong
currents
of
the
mèinam
and
brought
at
the
risk
and
peril
of
his
life
some
boiled
rice
and
water
in
the
hollow
of
a
bamboo
cane
which
as
he
floated
beneath
the
iron
cage
he
held
up
to
his
late
master
mouth
who
sucked
therefrom
the
scanty
portion
of
food
it
contained
the
last
night
of
the
unfortunate
prisoner
life
rama
set
out
as
usual
ignoring
the
pain
of
his
wounds
and
swimming
manfully
against
the
strong
tide
that
threatened
to
bear
him
away
with
it
he
reached
the
spot
about
three
in
the
morning
stealthily
approached
the
cage
keeping
his
head
under
water
but
his
heart
above
the
clouds
with
those
heroic
souls
who
follow
in
the
path
of
the
son
of
heaven
he
swam
right
under
the
cage
and
looking
up
in
the
darkness
towards
it
saw
no
shadow
there
he
held
up
the
long
bamboo
and
rested
it
against
the
iron
bars
but
no
eager
trembling
hand
grasped
it
as
it
was
wont
to
do
he
called
out
in
hoarse
whispers
soway
thô
master
master
pray
eat
no
sound
no
movement
reached
his
anxious
ears
ah
happy
man
the
loving
voice
of
his
devoted
follower
reached
his
ears
and
penetrated
far
into
his
sinking
heart
as
he
lay
in
his
last
agonies
coiled
up
on
the
floor
of
his
cage
and
in
the
double
darkness
of
night
and
sightlessness
he
saw
the
brave
strong
face
of
this
one
great
soul
that
loved
him
in
spite
of
all
his
sin
and
misery
and
even
as
he
caught
the
vision
a
smile
such
as
would
have
irradiated
the
throne
of
god
passed
over
that
blind
distorted
face
and
the
soul
flitted
away
rejoicing
leaving
behind
it
an
expression
of
serenity
and
peace
as
if
that
proud
turbulent
and
ambitious
spirit
had
at
last
been
taught
the
meaning
of
a
higher
love
and
through
it
had
breasted
the
waters
and
gained
the
shore
where
the
wicked
cease
from
troubling
and
the
weary
are
at
rest
after
some
years
of
service
in
the
army
the
premier
somdetch
ong
yai
being
dead
rama
having
been
regularly
branded
as
the
vassal
of
his
eldest
son
chow
mândtree
obtained
permission
to
return
home
to
his
wife
just
eight
years
after
these
events
and
the
very
year
after
his
return
home
there
was
born
to
this
brave
man
a
daughter
who
as
it
sometimes
happens
by
some
singular
freak
of
nature
or
perhaps
by
some
higher
law
of
development
was
so
wondrously
beautiful
that
when
rama
faithful
to
the
custom
of
his
ancestors
handed
to
his
wife
a
few
hours
after
her
delivery
a
ball
of
opium
to
be
rubbed
on
her
breasts
she
turned
up
to
him
a
scared
and
wondering
look
muttering
she
is
she
is
the
smile
of
god
the
deadly
ball
dropped
from
her
pulseless
hands
and
her
spirit
passed
away
and
he
broken
hearted
and
baffled
rightly
interpreted
the
significance
of
her
dying
words
not
only
spared
the
child
life
but
named
her
devo
smâyâtee
the
god
smiles
thus
a
new
life
stole
into
the
heart
and
the
arms
of
the
old
warrior
of
orissa
chapter
x
the
grandson
of
somdetch
ong
yai
and
his
tutor
chow
saduman
when
rama
and
his
daughter
were
carried
off
to
prison
poor
smâyâtee
hardly
realized
what
was
going
to
happen
but
when
a
couple
of
amazons
forced
her
away
from
her
father
and
she
understood
the
full
meaning
of
what
had
befallen
them
she
began
to
shout
and
scream
aloud
for
help
but
none
came
a
child
of
the
mountains
and
hills
she
had
as
yet
developed
none
but
the
natural
instincts
of
what
civilization
would
call
a
savage
combined
with
her
fine
organization
she
inherited
a
passionate
nature
and
an
intense
love
for
the
mountains
and
woods
the
earth
and
sky
which
were
to
her
so
many
beautiful
gods
to
some
she
had
been
accustomed
to
offer
flowers
to
others
fruit
oil
wine
honey
water
she
always
set
apart
a
portion
of
every
meal
for
her
favorite
god
dâvee
the
to
such
a
nature
only
to
live
was
worship
to
see
to
hear
to
gather
thoughts
and
pictures
to
feel
the
throbbing
pulses
to
fill
the
eye
with
images
of
beauty
the
heart
with
impulses
of
love
and
joy
to
place
the
mind
face
to
face
with
the
unwritten
mysteries
which
nature
unfolds
to
it
is
indeed
the
highest
sphere
of
contemplation
and
worship
as
well
for
the
savage
as
the
child
of
civilization
the
amazons
who
guarded
the
cell
chatted
together
in
a
low
tone
while
smâyâtee
exhausted
by
her
cries
and
screams
for
help
had
sunk
into
a
deep
sleep
they
remarked
on
the
beauty
of
her
skin
the
roundness
of
her
limbs
the
softness
of
her
cheeks
and
the
superb
lashes
that
rested
so
lightly
upon
them
and
wondered
who
she
could
be
for
though
her
dress
bespoke
her
of
the
peasant
class
of
the
loatians
her
form
and
face
betokened
high
birth
he
must
have
stolen
her
said
one
of
the
women
she
can
not
be
his
daughter
though
she
calls
him
father
he
has
brought
her
here
for
sale
of
course
added
another
else
why
should
he
have
chosen
such
a
place
as
this
so
near
the
royal
palace
for
encampment
ah
well
whatever
be
her
lot
poor
child
let
us
not
add
to
her
sufferings
she
will
have
enough
of
them
in
this
life
rejoined
the
chief
officer
the
bell
above
the
prison
gate
with
its
brazen
tongue
tolled
out
twelve
five
in
the
morning
the
girl
aroused
as
it
were
by
the
voice
of
an
angel
started
rubbed
her
eyes
and
looking
around
seemed
to
recall
the
events
of
the
last
night
she
then
made
several
profound
salutations
and
invocations
to
a
gleam
of
sunlight
that
came
straggling
into
her
cell
wrapped
her
saree
over
her
head
and
face
and
placed
herself
near
the
door
so
as
to
be
able
to
pass
out
the
moment
it
should
be
opened
take
something
to
eat
child
said
the
chief
of
the
amazons
on
guard
who
was
partaking
of
a
breakfast
of
cold
rice
and
fish
and
wait
till
the
sun
is
higher
in
the
heavens
and
i
will
go
with
you
it
is
not
fit
that
one
so
young
and
beautiful
should
go
out
alone
and
unprotected
she
was
too
to
tell
her
that
she
was
a
prisoner
and
no
longer
free
to
go
in
and
out
smâyâtee
had
hardly
swallowed
a
few
mouthfuls
of
rice
when
the
guardsman
of
the
previous
night
appeared
with
orders
to
the
amazons
to
take
her
to
the
sala
of
the
grand
duke
chow
mândtree
as
they
on
discovering
from
the
mark
on
the
old
man
arm
that
he
was
a
vassal
of
that
nobleman
had
resigned
him
to
the
custody
of
his
officers
the
amazons
led
the
way
and
smâyâtee
followed
with
faltering
steps
nobody
noticed
her
everybody
seemed
excited
and
eager
every
one
hurried
towards
the
same
spot
in
her
uncertainty
the
girl
could
see
nothing
in
the
world
but
the
river
running
strong
yet
running
calmly
on
after
a
little
while
she
began
to
trace
the
opposite
bank
a
little
way
to
the
left
something
hanging
midway
in
the
sky
as
she
supposed
or
rather
in
there
being
as
yet
no
sky
no
heaven
no
earth
nothing
but
the
river
this
was
a
bridge
they
cross
the
bridge
where
does
it
lead
to
whither
flows
this
mysterious
stream
of
which
the
coming
and
the
going
are
equally
full
of
wonder
and
dread
to
her
what
mysterious
enchanted
palaces
and
temples
are
those
looming
out
yonder
on
the
other
side
to
her
ignorance
they
are
but
infinitude
and
the
unknown
now
they
near
the
duke
palace
the
odors
of
and
reach
them
like
airs
that
breathe
from
paradise
having
come
to
the
great
hall
the
amazons
take
their
places
on
one
of
the
lowest
steps
smâyâtee
seated
between
them
they
are
contented
to
chew
their
betel
and
to
wait
the
hall
is
full
of
men
the
work
of
branding
and
enrolling
goes
briskly
on
under
the
orders
of
a
young
nobleman
called
nai
dhamaphat
the
grandson
of
somdetch
ong
yai
every
now
and
then
some
persons
are
brought
forward
to
be
admonished
fined
or
whipped
sometimes
from
among
this
crowd
a
boy
is
dragged
out
forcibly
and
branded
through
the
masses
of
men
lighted
up
now
by
the
full
blaze
of
sunlight
smâyâtee
sought
one
form
and
one
figure
only
and
he
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
suddenly
the
grand
duke
was
announced
he
entered
the
hall
with
conscious
swagger
followed
by
a
long
train
of
attendants
and
slaves
no
words
could
express
what
there
was
in
the
face
and
figure
of
this
man
as
he
rolled
rather
than
walked
into
the
centre
of
the
hall
work
instantly
ceased
all
around
crouched
and
hid
their
faces
this
did
not
rouse
his
huge
drowsy
nature
into
even
a
look
of
recognition
he
growled
rather
than
spoke
the
orders
for
the
workers
to
continue
and
turned
to
his
son
and
said
dhamaphat
what
is
this
about
rama
singalee
having
attacked
the
captain
of
the
royal
guards
my
lord
replied
the
latter
the
captain
as
far
as
i
can
learn
is
as
much
to
blame
as
the
old
soldier
who
says
he
only
struck
him
in
defence
of
his
daughter
a
daughter
eh
i
did
not
know
the
old
fellow
had
a
daughter
at
this
point
in
the
conversation
smâyâtee
who
had
been
listening
with
deep
attention
leaned
forward
and
fearlessly
addressed
the
duke
said
do
you
want
that
i
should
tell
you
how
it
happened
my
lord
well
speak
out
said
the
duke
turning
savagely
upon
the
girl
for
having
dared
to
interrupt
him
unbidden
he
checked
himself
however
as
his
eye
fell
upon
the
graceful
veiled
figure
and
said
rather
more
gently
go
on
how
was
it
smâyâtee
threw
back
her
covering
sat
up
and
repeated
the
story
of
her
long
journey
her
father
fears
to
leave
her
alone
at
home
their
encampment
near
the
royal
palace
her
fearful
alarm
and
how
it
was
to
save
her
that
her
father
struck
the
captain
of
the
king
guard
the
girl
never
looked
so
beautiful
so
fearless
there
was
in
her
look
the
innocence
and
the
ignorance
of
a
babe
it
was
not
the
words
she
uttered
but
the
face
she
presented
the
look
so
sad
and
yet
so
full
of
trust
which
served
to
rouse
the
drowsy
nature
of
the
duke
and
to
change
his
repulsiveness
into
something
more
hideous
still
dhamaphat
listened
too
with
intense
interest
it
seemed
as
if
his
whole
soul
were
concentrated
into
his
eyes
and
ears
the
duke
was
puzzled
what
to
say
he
turned
to
exchange
a
few
words
in
an
undertone
with
his
son
and
then
dismissed
the
amazons
charging
them
on
the
peril
of
their
lives
not
to
lose
sight
of
the
girl
and
promising
the
latter
to
have
the
matter
investigated
on
the
following
day
in
siamese
life
the
lights
and
shadows
are
equally
strong
at
once
brilliant
and
gloomy
smiling
and
sombre
lighted
as
by
the
radiance
of
dawn
and
at
the
same
time
enveloped
in
the
darkness
of
night
the
branding
and
enrolling
for
the
day
was
over
the
crowds
dispersed
to
their
various
homes
when
the
young
man
nai
dhamaphat
went
out
he
had
but
one
thought
it
was
to
follow
that
girl
and
try
if
possible
to
see
her
face
and
hear
her
voice
again
there
was
something
in
that
face
that
had
changed
the
whole
current
of
his
being
and
had
set
him
charged
with
a
new
force
in
the
midst
of
a
little
world
all
by
itself
the
horizon
of
which
was
bounded
by
her
possible
smile
he
turned
his
steps
towards
the
grand
palace
and
gazed
upon
the
place
where
she
was
imprisoned
he
was
almost
at
the
gate
he
wavered
in
his
mind
custom
and
his
natural
reserve
forbade
him
to
speak
to
a
strange
woman
with
a
bewildered
air
he
retraced
his
steps
and
went
home
that
part
of
bangkok
in
which
chow
mândtree
lived
was
laid
out
in
small
squares
each
walled
in
by
low
ramparts
enclosing
the
residence
and
harem
of
some
great
noble
but
the
duke
palaces
were
surrounded
by
a
wall
only
on
three
sides
from
which
ran
parallel
to
the
several
streets
and
among
them
the
gold
and
silver
streets
so
designated
from
their
being
inhabited
by
artists
skilled
in
the
working
of
those
metals
the
sun
had
set
when
dhamaphat
reached
his
home
but
it
was
already
night
here
there
is
no
twilight
that
soft
messenger
that
lingers
unwilling
as
it
were
to
usher
in
the
darkness
of
night
moonlight
with
its
silvery
touches
rested
on
the
palace
roofs
and
made
even
ugliness
and
decay
beautiful
the
tall
cocoa
and
betel
palms
moved
by
the
fluttered
and
waved
their
branches
to
and
fro
beckoning
him
nearer
and
nearer
and
presenting
a
spectacle
strange
yet
lovely
in
the
extreme
the
bright
moon
was
soon
lost
to
view
except
where
it
penetrated
the
thick
overhanging
foliage
on
the
gateway
the
pendent
branches
of
the
bergamot
gave
forth
a
rich
perfume
the
shrill
chirping
of
myriads
of
grasshoppers
which
seem
never
to
sleep
with
the
sounds
of
distant
music
fell
upon
his
ear
as
his
father
temples
and
palaces
burst
upon
his
view
a
mingled
scene
of
fairy
beauty
artificial
elegance
and
savage
grandeur
domes
turrets
enormous
trees
and
flowers
such
as
are
met
with
nowhere
else
beneath
the
sun
the
oldest
temples
in
siam
stood
here
containing
strange
and
wonderful
objects
with
stranger
and
more
wonderful
recollections
attached
to
them
that
one
on
the
right
was
once
in
the
reign
of
the
usurper
tak
the
principal
stronghold
of
his
ancestors
and
where
even
after
long
years
they
were
still
wont
to
repair
at
a
particular
moon
in
every
year
to
pray
beside
the
golden
pagoda
that
enshrined
the
charred
bones
of
his
forefathers
that
gray
palace
had
witnessed
many
a
gay
assemblage
held
by
the
old
duke
somdetch
ong
yai
his
grandfather
he
entered
the
temple
beneath
the
portal
of
which
were
some
deeply
graven
rhymes
from
the
vedas
to
him
equally
dark
as
the
dark
image
of
buddha
that
had
slumbered
for
centuries
at
the
base
of
the
glittering
altar
yet
wonderful
as
were
the
objects
that
met
the
eye
of
the
young
man
he
simply
prostrated
himself
before
the
altar
and
turned
to
his
father
palace
a
low
open
verandah
faced
the
entrance
choice
birds
were
singing
in
their
cages
and
soft
lights
of
were
gleaming
down
upon
them
a
number
of
noblemen
were
lounging
on
cool
mats
some
playing
chess
others
engaged
in
conversation
slaves
were
passing
round
tempting
fruits
and
refreshing
drinks
of
spiced
wines
and
cocoanut
nectar
dhamaphat
prostrated
himself
before
his
father
and
took
his
place
on
a
low
seat
he
had
no
sooner
done
so
than
he
was
startled
by
the
entrance
of
some
armed
men
who
brought
in
the
old
rajpoot
and
stationed
him
and
themselves
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
verandah
there
was
something
particularly
interesting
about
the
prisoner
he
was
a
tall
slender
man
about
sixty
fair
with
aquiline
features
and
expressive
and
determined
countenance
there
were
lines
on
his
face
that
told
of
hardship
and
suffering
though
these
seemed
in
no
degree
to
have
depressed
his
spirits
or
to
have
impaired
his
youthful
vigor
and
activity
he
wore
a
blue
cloak
and
an
ample
turban
of
blue
silk
the
duke
at
length
addressed
the
prisoner
and
said
rama
you
have
committed
a
crime
which
if
you
had
not
been
my
slave
would
have
handed
you
over
to
the
criminal
prison
for
life
or
to
instant
death
and
now
since
your
daughter
has
told
us
with
her
own
lips
that
it
was
in
her
defence
you
struck
the
captain
of
the
royal
guards
i
am
going
to
pay
him
a
heavy
fine
and
smother
this
affair
but
only
on
one
condition
however
the
duke
paused
for
a
reply
or
some
expression
of
thankfulness
none
came
the
old
soldier
turned
his
head
and
looked
at
him
in
serious
doubt
after
waiting
a
little
while
he
repeated
only
on
one
condition
that
thou
sell
to
us
for
our
service
and
pleasure
this
daughter
of
thine
and
we
will
take
better
care
of
her
than
thou
art
able
to
do
it
was
fully
half
an
hour
before
rama
seemed
to
comprehend
the
meaning
of
his
master
words
he
had
never
thought
of
daughter
occupying
such
a
position
he
had
hardly
realized
that
she
was
no
longer
a
child
now
his
feeling
of
caste
and
race
rose
up
within
him
his
strong
nature
was
moved
as
he
saw
her
snatched
away
from
him
all
manner
of
recollections
and
reveries
full
of
tenderness
came
whispering
at
his
heart
and
the
words
my
lord
to
this
i
can
never
consent
came
slowly
brokenly
forth
as
if
out
of
a
heart
struggling
for
mastery
over
some
great
emotion
the
duke
sprang
to
his
feet
staggered
for
he
had
been
drinking
heavily
up
to
the
chained
prisoner
and
clenching
his
palsied
trembling
hand
he
cried
in
a
thundering
voice
you
dare
to
refuse
me
by
the
gods
i
will
neither
eat
nor
drink
until
i
have
seized
and
given
her
to
my
lowest
slave
and
if
you
do
not
quickly
repent
of
your
rash
refusal
you
shall
be
cast
into
prison
for
the
rest
of
your
life
do
you
forget
what
my
father
did
for
you
you
ungrateful
dog
and
his
dark
face
became
purple
with
rage
and
fury
the
old
warrior
trembled
in
every
limb
not
from
fear
but
from
horror
he
knew
what
to
expect
from
the
eldest
son
of
his
late
master
his
heart
burned
with
indignation
but
what
could
he
do
how
could
he
defend
her
he
thought
bitterly
of
the
weakness
that
had
placed
the
honor
of
his
house
and
race
at
the
mercy
of
a
stranger
that
little
ball
of
opium
would
have
saved
her
from
all
possible
insult
he
groaned
aloud
feeling
that
this
was
a
just
retribution
for
his
innovation
upon
the
ancient
custom
of
his
house
and
large
tears
rolled
down
his
rugged
face
the
drowning
man
overtaken
by
the
supreme
agony
lives
in
an
instant
through
all
his
happy
and
unhappy
past
in
a
single
moment
he
sees
the
whole
drama
of
his
life
reacted
before
him
thus
it
was
with
rama
he
recalled
with
anguish
the
scenes
of
smâyâtee
childhood
her
youth
and
growing
womanhood
all
her
early
gladness
all
her
bright
hopes
and
illusions
all
her
gifts
of
beauty
and
affection
which
made
one
picture
with
her
present
degradation
and
served
only
to
darken
the
riddle
of
her
life
to
him
the
courage
that
had
withstood
a
hungry
tiger
now
gave
way
before
the
picture
of
the
deeper
degradation
that
might
because
of
his
refusal
befall
his
child
he
flung
himself
on
the
ground
and
muttered
she
is
yours
my
lord
good
said
the
duke
clapping
his
hands
i
knew
you
would
give
in
you
are
no
fool
rama
it
is
the
women
whom
we
find
so
difficult
to
manage
when
they
take
an
idea
into
their
heads
take
him
away
to
his
cell
now
said
he
addressing
the
guards
we
will
make
it
all
right
and
when
the
girl
comes
to
the
sala
we
shall
apprise
her
of
the
high
honors
in
store
for
her
here
said
he
throwing
some
money
to
the
jailers
go
you
and
make
merry
till
morning
and
be
sure
and
give
the
prisoner
as
much
as
he
can
eat
and
drink
the
guards
departed
leading
away
a
fierce
old
man
when
they
were
gone
the
duke
addressing
nai
dhamaphat
said
what
think
you
of
our
clemency
to
our
slaves
my
son
we
would
not
take
possession
of
this
beautiful
girl
without
the
old
fellow
consent
he
then
began
to
laugh
and
added
ah
she
shall
be
my
and
my
good
friends
here
will
have
an
opportunity
of
admiring
her
beauty
the
son
simply
bowed
his
head
in
seeming
acknowledgment
of
his
father
goodness
and
after
a
while
retired
from
the
pavilion
passed
over
the
bridge
and
out
of
the
palace
gates
there
could
not
be
a
greater
difference
of
character
than
that
which
existed
between
the
duke
and
his
eldest
son
the
one
gross
sensual
cowardly
the
other
proud
and
domineering
yet
withal
brave
generous
religious
and
impulsive
every
year
found
them
farther
apart
in
education
thought
feelings
hopes
and
aspirations
the
one
standing
as
it
were
with
his
foot
on
the
first
step
of
a
ladder
that
was
to
lead
him
towards
the
highest
ideal
of
christianity
the
other
sunk
beyond
all
hope
in
the
ignorance
of
a
savage
barbarism
but
now
this
last
scene
was
too
much
for
the
former
it
snapped
asunder
the
fragile
cord
that
still
bound
him
to
his
father
and
placed
him
in
the
position
of
an
antagonist
every
nation
has
certain
constitutional
peculiarities
which
give
rise
to
practices
and
phases
of
thought
very
startling
to
others
who
are
in
such
points
differently
constituted
the
most
remarkable
peculiarity
of
this
kind
is
the
reverence
with
which
parents
are
regarded
in
siam
no
matter
how
unjust
capricious
cruel
and
repulsive
a
parent
may
be
a
child
is
bound
to
reverence
his
or
her
slightest
wish
as
a
sacred
obligation
for
dhamaphat
therefore
even
to
question
his
father
actions
was
he
felt
a
moral
dereliction
he
was
full
of
remorse
and
regret
and
thought
with
despair
of
the
fate
that
awaited
him
he
had
gained
a
little
wooden
bridge
which
thrown
across
a
canal
led
him
into
a
lonely
field
here
he
motioned
back
the
slaves
who
attempted
to
follow
him
and
strode
rapidly
out
into
the
open
country
where
he
no
longer
heard
the
sounds
of
revelry
feasting
and
licentious
mirth
rambling
through
the
many
tangled
he
gradually
emerged
into
a
low
wooded
expanse
the
air
was
full
of
delicious
fragrance
and
alive
with
strange
noises
he
saw
in
the
distance
the
calm
majestic
river
all
aglow
with
its
myriads
of
lights
and
lanterns
yet
it
failed
to
call
forth
a
single
reflection
he
could
picture
nothing
but
the
face
of
the
strange
girl
and
that
haunted
him
all
the
way
he
pressed
on
tired
feverish
with
sad
and
troubled
thoughts
he
reached
the
wall
that
skirts
the
city
throwing
some
silver
to
the
guards
who
knew
him
well
he
passed
out
of
the
gate
and
out
of
the
city
of
the
invincible
to
the
visible
archangel
of
nature
here
the
solitude
was
startling
no
more
streets
no
more
lights
no
more
houses
even
the
quiet
river
seemed
to
hush
on
her
white
and
shining
bosom
the
soft
light
of
the
moon
as
if
it
were
the
face
of
a
beloved
child
until
she
caught
a
reflection
of
its
beauty
and
was
transfigured
down
a
hundred
feet
deep
as
far
as
light
could
penetrate
into
a
clear
translucent
soul
in
its
first
dreamless
sleep
moved
by
some
secret
purpose
he
hurried
on
through
a
profusion
of
flowering
plants
and
trees
he
passed
unnoticed
the
slender
betel
and
cocoanut
palms
and
the
numerous
species
of
huge
convolvuli
that
coiled
around
their
stately
stems
and
ran
to
the
limit
of
the
land
the
long
of
the
wild
plantains
the
rich
foliage
of
the
almonds
the
gorgeous
oleanders
that
broke
through
the
green
masses
in
every
variety
of
tint
from
the
richest
crimson
to
the
lightest
pink
presently
he
dashed
aside
a
huge
cereus
and
stood
before
a
long
low
building
a
partly
ruined
monastery
adjoining
an
ancient
and
dilapidated
buddhist
temple
the
monastery
was
a
sort
of
long
low
corridor
or
hall
lined
on
each
side
with
chambers
each
about
ten
feet
deep
and
lighted
by
a
small
aperture
in
the
wall
it
was
a
gloomy
place
old
and
unhealthy
poisonous
plants
creepers
and
flowers
reigned
jubilant
here
with
ruin
and
desolation
for
companions
yet
dismantled
and
ruined
as
the
building
appeared
it
had
been
the
school
of
young
dhamaphat
for
nearly
ten
years
and
it
was
the
home
of
a
solitary
old
man
who
had
spent
forty
years
of
his
lifetime
forgetful
of
friends
affections
food
sleep
and
almost
of
existence
in
his
contemplations
of
the
mystery
of
things
beyond
and
that
still
greater
mystery
called
life
his
friends
and
relations
had
endeavored
by
every
artifice
the
allurements
of
beauty
and
every
other
imaginable
gratification
to
divert
him
from
the
resolution
he
had
adopted
every
attempt
to
dissuade
him
had
been
in
vain
and
now
he
had
gained
a
fame
as
widespread
as
the
most
ambitious
heart
could
desire
among
the
people
he
was
known
under
the
title
of
chow
sâduman
the
sainted
priest
of
heaven
prodigious
stories
were
afloat
about
him
born
of
noble
parents
he
had
from
his
early
youth
practised
an
asceticism
so
rigorous
and
severe
that
it
had
prepared
him
it
was
thought
for
his
supernatural
mission
it
was
not
only
alleged
but
believed
that
at
the
sound
of
his
inspired
voice
the
dead
arose
and
walked
the
sick
were
healed
that
diseases
vanished
at
the
touch
of
his
hand
sinners
were
converted
by
his
simple
admonition
wild
beasts
and
serpents
were
obedient
to
his
word
and
that
in
his
moments
of
ecstasy
he
floated
in
the
air
before
the
eyes
of
his
disciples
passed
through
stone
walls
and
barred
gates
and
in
fact
could
do
whatsoever
he
willed
the
crumbling
old
door
of
the
cell
was
partly
open
no
light
was
visible
and
as
dhamaphat
stood
there
hesitating
whether
he
would
enter
a
low
faint
tremulous
sound
came
out
of
the
darkness
within
and
floated
upward
on
the
silence
of
night
like
the
voice
of
some
celestial
chorister
it
was
the
buddhist
evening
hymn
or
chant
and
the
familiar
words
nama
buddsa
phakava
thouraha
sama
boodhsa
thatsa
phutthang
purisa
thamma
sârâthi
sangkhang
saranang

freely
translated
o
thou
who

the
light
boundless
in
knowledge
beautiful
as
day
irradiate
my
heart
my
life
my
night
nor
let
me
ever
from
thy
presence
stray
touched
his
better
nature
and
melted
his
heart
he
stooped
forward
and
listened
to
it
lovingly
as
it
rose
higher
and
higher
growing
more
and
more
exultant
till
it
caught
his
trembling
spirit
and
bore
it
away
beyond
the
confines
of
this
world
face
to
face
with
a
divine
ineffable
presence
full
of
harmony
and
beauty
his
anger
and
his
grief
were
forgotten
so
dhamaphat
turned
his
face
to
the
sky
one
moment
he
stood
erect
in
an
absolute
halo
of
light
the
next
he
was
combatting
darkly
with
the
blind
shadows
of
love
and
hate
cause
and
effect
merit
and
demerit
the
endless
evolutions
of
the
wheel
of
an
irresistible
law
into
which
all
things
are
cast
he
felt
something
cold
pass
over
his
hand
he
started
and
became
aware
that
the
good
priest
had
finished
his
devotions
he
tapped
gently
and
was
told
to
enter
which
he
did
hesitatingly
in
the
middle
of
the
cell
sat
the
priest
who
seemed
even
in
his
old
age
full
of
the
vigor
of
manhood
his
legs
were
crossed
his
arms
folded
and
his
eyes
cast
down
he
did
not
even
raise
them
at
the
entrance
of
the
young
man
he
was
in
that
commonly
called
contemplation
in
one
corner
a
narrow
plank
quite
bare
and
a
wooden
pillow
served
for
his
bed
beside
it
an
old
fan
a
pot
for
water
an
earthen
vessel
for
rice
some
rude
old
instruments
and
books
beyond
these
the
cell
was
bare
damp
cold
slimy
and
unhealthy
it
was
without
any
light
save
where
the
moonlight
fell
in
ghastly
lights
and
shadows
through
the
slits
in
the
wall
my
father
said
the
young
man
as
he
reverently
prostrated
himself
before
the
priest
who
half
opened
his
dull
eyes
and
said
phinong
peace
brother
alas
replied
dhamaphat
in
this
life
there
is
no
peace
no
rest
no
freedom
from
suffering
the
endless
revolutions
of
the
wheel
only
crush
out
life
to
reproduce
it
again
in
another
form
take
the
reins
and
ride
over
it
then
said
the
priest
meditatively
what
says
the
dharma
padam
stop
the
chariot
valiantly
arrest
the
horses
of
desire
when
thou
hast
comprehended
that
which
is
made
thou
wilt
understand
that
which
is
not
made
the
uncreate
some
do
not
know
that
we
must
all
come
to
an
end
here
but
some
do
know
it
and
with
them
all
conflicts
cease
he
who
lives
for
pleasure
only
his
passions
uncontrolled
immoderate
in
his
enjoyments
idle
and
weak
him
will
the
tempter
overcome
as
the
wind
overcomes
a
tree
if
we
could
live
a
thousand
years
it
would
be
worth
our
while
to
struggle
after
the
pleasures
of
this
world
death
comes
too
soon
there
are
many
beginnings
but
no
ending
to
life
let
us
practise
the
four
virtues
my
brother
they
alone
are
real
satisfactory
the
true
illuminators
of
the
mind
without
this
inward
illumination
what
is
life
but
darkness
storms
wild
unconscious
tumult
the
ceaseless
tumbling
of
the
fierce
tides
of
passion
and
death
but
exhaustion
alas
cried
the
young
man
in
a
voice
full
of
emotion
is
life
indeed
such
an
empty
void
is
there
no
compensation
anywhere
the
priest
opened
wide
his
eyes
looked
full
into
dhamaphat
face
and
remarked
thou
art
strangely
disturbed
my
brother
is
it
not
well
with
thee
dhamaphat
made
no
reply
there
was
sympathy
and
a
touch
of
tender
feeling
in
the
voice
of
the
priest
as
he
bent
close
to
his
young
pupil
and
said
what
is
thy
suffering
speak
freely
to
me
and
i
will
aid
thee
to
the
utmost
of
my
ability
saying
this
the
priest
arose
and
passed
his
hand
slowly
over
the
clefts
in
the
wall
instantly
the
moon
withdrew
her
light
at
this
moment
the
suddenly
gave
a
harsh
and
prolonged
cry
that
bird
answers
to
thy
thoughts
said
the
priest
dhamaphat
shuddered
he
believed
that
in
the
cry
of
the
bird
he
heard
an
echo
of
his
own
wild
desire
to
frustrate
his
father
plans
then
in
a
few
stirring
words
he
told
the
priest
of
his
love
for
the
rajpoot
daughter
of
her
present
situation
and
of
his
desire
to
help
her
and
her
father
to
escape
at
the
words
rajpoot
daughter
the
old
man
started
and
there
passed
over
his
face
unseen
an
expression
of
regret
mingled
with
desire
with
which
a
thirsty
man
sees
afar
off
out
of
his
possible
reach
a
cup
of
cold
water
for
which
he
is
dying
but
which
is
not
for
him
then
as
suddenly
he
sat
down
and
resumed
his
calm
exterior
a
full
hour
passed
in
complete
silence
the
old
man
and
the
young
man
sat
in
the
darkness
with
their
faces
turned
to
one
another
each
on
his
side
thinking
over
the
same
things
and
feeling
the
same
impulses
this
is
very
strange
said
he
at
length
when
i
made
my
annual
pilgrimage
to
batt
last
year
a
lovely
girl
rama
the
daughter
who
called
herself
devo
smâyâtee
brought
me
food
every
morning
and
washed
my
feet
every
evening
she
was
then
hardly
a
woman
but
she
filled
my
heart
with
a
fragrance
which
is
but
added
the
priest
in
an
undertone
as
if
for
himself
death
carries
off
a
man
who
is
gathering
flowers
as
a
flood
sweeps
away
a
sleeping
village
he
in
whom
the
desire
for
the
ineffable
nirwana
has
sprung
up
whose
thoughts
are
not
bewildered
by
love
he
is
the
borne
on
the
stream
of
immortality
he
will
stand
face
to
face
with
the
infinite
he
spoke
slowly
and
deliberately
repeating
each
word
as
if
they
conveyed
some
peculiar
meaning
to
his
mind
and
some
subtle
charm
to
his
senses
nay
father
rejoined
the
young
man
interrupting
him
you
do
not
tell
me
how
i
can
help
her
the
good
old
priest
for
good
he
was
in
spite
of
the
strong
natural
man
within
him
turned
on
dhamaphat
a
look
partly
of
sorrow
and
partly
of
affection
then
drawing
towards
him
one
of
his
mysterious
books
he
placed
it
on
his
head
with
his
hands
spread
out
to
heaven
he
gradually
moved
his
body
to
and
fro
until
his
gyrations
became
rapid
and
grotesque
uttering
strange
prayers
and
incantations
after
a
short
time
he
began
to
prophesy
and
said
in
fitful
spasms
thy
days
are
numbered
the
long
night
for
him
is
at
hand
fear
not
this
mountain
flower
will
blossom
in
on
thy
bosom
for
more
than
an
hour
a
cloud
had
darkened
the
sky
the
moment
the
priest
had
done
prophesying
a
ray
of
moonlight
suddenly
lighted
up
his
pale
face
and
was
reflected
from
his
smoothly
shaven
head
like
a
luminous
circle
after
gazing
upon
it
for
some
ten
minutes
dhamaphat
began
to
tremble
and
turned
deadly
pale
feeling
that
he
was
in
the
presence
of
a
supernatural
being
he
once
more
prostrated
himself
and
withdrew
some
secret
influence
from
the
priest
had
for
the
moment
benumbed
into
icy
coldness
and
even
indifference
his
ardent
love
for
smâyâtee
it
was
almost
dawn
when
he
sought
his
couch
for
rest
a
dream
of
the
night
meanwhile
the
prisoner
rama
had
had
a
plentiful
repast
and
was
sleeping
heavily
with
fatigue
and
despair
for
a
pillow
on
the
damp
floor
of
his
cell
towards
morning
a
cold
sweat
broke
out
on
his
brow
he
felt
creeping
over
him
an
indefinable
horror
a
sort
of
nightmare
which
he
struggled
in
vain
to
shake
off
he
groaned
panted
and
at
length
sat
up
with
a
tremendous
effort
in
a
niche
in
the
wall
he
fancied
he
saw
a
pale
blue
misty
outline
of
a
human
figure
so
indistinct
that
at
first
he
could
only
distrust
his
own
vision
but
gradually
it
began
to
take
form
at
length
it
was
as
clear
and
palpable
as
a
shape
of
life
it
was
the
face
and
figure
of
the
priest
chow
sâduman
whom
he
had
met
a
year
ago
in
the
mountains
of
batt
he
was
dressed
in
a
loose
robe
of
cloudy
yellow
his
legs
were
crossed
his
arms
folded
across
his
breast
his
eyes
cast
down
he
seemed
to
be
praying
the
shadow
of
the
shade
in
the
background
grew
darker
and
the
form
grew
lurid
as
if
surrounded
by
fire
rama
stared
rubbed
his
eyes
plainer
did
the
figure
of
the
priest
appear
until
it
seemed
to
rise
and
swell
and
fill
the
whole
cell
a
dark
heavy
mist
settled
on
the
prisoner
face
but
the
apparition
grew
brighter
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
shuddering
with
horror
he
cried
speak
whoever
thou
art
and
tell
me
thy
commands
they
shall
be
obeyed
suddenly
he
felt
a
violent
shaking
of
the
ground
on
which
he
was
seated
each
moment
he
expected
to
be
hurled
into
an
abyss
below
he
clung
to
the
earth
and
cried
again
speak
for
by
the
gods
dâvee
and
dhupiyâ
i
vow
to
fulfil
thy
behest
even
if
it
be
to
offer
thee
a
human
sacrifice
he
then
perceived
a
soft
cloud
filling
the
cell
and
in
the
centre
of
the
cloud
were
luminous
characters
which
he
read
thus
sell
not
thy
daughter
to
the
duke
the
apparition
vanished
almost
as
soon
as
he
had
deciphered
the
words
rama
fell
back
against
the
wall
of
his
cell
and
awoke
it
was
long
before
he
could
collect
his
scattered
faculties
and
what
were
left
to
him
seemed
steeped
in
illusion
he
could
only
wonder
and
bow
in
mystified
adoration
before
the
niche
in
his
cell

every

heard
the

joy

seemed
to
die
away
on
the
lips
of
the
strange
girl

throwing
off

sprang
across

and
clasped

about
the
neck
after

paroxysm

over
she
realized
that

she
looked
still

into

seeing
no

there
laid
her
head
upon

bound

never
scene

been
presented
in

hall
before
it
arrested
every

filled

heart
with
sympathy

it
was
no

the

a
creature

as

delicate

almost
greek
in

her

perfect

slender

by
the
metallic
and
glass
bangles

wore

rich
black
hair
hung
in
long
braids

a
coarse
blue
bodice
which
revealed
a
form
of
faultless
proportions

breast

by
a
yellow
cord

a
flat
silver
ring
on
which

inscribed

prostrate
girl
filled
the
father
and
the
son
first
with
pleasure
then
with
fascination
afterwards
with
rapture
drawn
on
by
irresistible
steps
they
both
arrived
unknown
to
the
other
at
that
stage
of
passion
which
blinds
the
sensibilities
to
everything
else
but
the
desire
of
one
was
to
possess
the
other
to
rescue
the
old
soldier
did
not
attempt
to
raise
his
daughter
but
taking
off
his
turban
buried
his
face
in
it
the
duke
was
transported
stupefied
he
paused
hesitated
then
suddenly
without
knowing
what
moved
him
he
said
in
a
gentle
tender
voice
why
girl
raise
up
your
head
see
your
father
is
now
going
to
be
set
free
smâyâtee
lifted
up
her
head
and
looked
at
the
speaker
with
an
expression
of
childlike
gladness
and
trust
that
brought
to
the
heart
of
the
wretch
before
her
the
sense
of
shame
and
he
could
not
for
the
moment
give
utterance
to
the
iniquity
he
was
about
to
perpetrate
against
her
he
beckoned
to
an
attendant
however
a
sort
of
treasurer
with
a
heavy
box
who
approached
crawling
and
at
his
instructions
counted
upon
the
floor
forty
pieces
of
gold
sixteen
times
the
value
of
an
ordinary
rama
still
covered
his
face
with
his
turban
so
that
none
could
have
told
what
was
passing
within
him
his
daughter
laid
her
hand
upon
his
arm
saying
o
my
father
the
good
duke
gives
us
all
this
gold
and
promises
us
freedom
take
it
and
thank
him
that
he
may
permit
us
to
return
home
the
unhappy
rajpoot
turned
a
look
full
of
mournful
tenderness
upon
his
child
at
the
same
moment
the
scribe
who
had
been
industriously
writing
laid
a
paper
before
him
and
said
in
rather
an
authoritative
manner
tham
khai
khat
thedeo
make
the
sale
good
sign
the
paper
even
now
it
did
not
occur
to
the
girl
what
the
paper
and
the
forty
pieces
of
gold
meant
to
her
mind
they
brought
visions
of
freedom
as
her
heart
yearned
for
the
hills
and
groves
of
her
native
land
she
once
more
whispered
to
her
father
to
take
the
money
and
thank
the
duke
that
he
may
let
us
go
back
home
but
the
old
man
looked
at
her
in
silence
seemingly
unable
to
utter
a
single
word
his
breathing
came
quick
and
hard
and
all
at
once
he
gasped
out
the
gods
forbid
me
to
sell
my
daughter
to
thee
my
lord
indra
agni
and
the
maruts
at
whose
roaring
every
dweller
upon
earth
trembles
forbid
me
o
pardon
thy
servant
my
lord
and
let
us
depart
hence
in
peace
the
duke
was
doubly
enraged
because
of
his
last
night
promise
and
the
forty
pieces
of
gold
with
which
he
had
hoped
to
bribe
him
into
an
easy
parting
with
his
child
he
turned
to
the
bewildered
smâyâtee
and
said
come
hither
girl
but
as
she
only
looked
at
him
and
made
no
attempt
to
go
nearer
he
added
one
thing
is
certain
this
old
fool
thy
father
is
still
drunk
and
knows
not
his
mind
he
sold
you
to
me
last
night
and
now
he
refuses
saying
the
gods
forbid
it

a
young
siamese
nobleman
smâyâtee
turned
from
the
duke
to
her
father
her
look
changing
from
incredulity
to
surprise
from
surprise
to
anguish
while
the
duke
continued
now
it
is
you
who
must
decide
for
him
shall
i
hand
him
over
to
the
royal
judges
to
be

you
rich
and
happy
and
i
will
give
him
this
gold
and
he
shall
return
in
safety
to
his
home
he
uttered
these
sentences
in
a
loud
harsh
voice
very
different
from
that
in
which
he
had
spoken
to
her
a
few
minutes
before
when
he
had
finished
the
crowd
cheered
the
speech
the
girl
looked
at
them
and
not
knowing
why
began
to
cry
this
exasperated
the
duke
he
blew
a
small
silver
whistle
instantly
a
hand
of
armed
men
entered
the
hall
and
he
gave
orders
that
the
prisoner
should
be
conveyed
to
the
supreme
court
to
be
tried
for
attacking
the
chief
officer
of
the
royal
guard
with
intent
to
murder
him
while
he
was
on
duty
at

seemed
to
take
her
resolution
she
crawled
up
to
the
savage
duke

laid
her
head
down
upon

kissed
them
saying
i

the

dimly
conscious
of
the
sublimity

noted
how

overcome
her

how
readily
she
had
sacrificed
herself
for
her

and
thought
he
saw
in
her
face
the
effulgence
of
a
heavenly
light
the
order
was
given
and
the
rajpoot
was
free

from

of

some
who
rule
others
who
obey

those
who
serve
here
disinterestedness
vanishes
out
of
sight
each
one
is
for
herself
they
are
nearly
all
young
women
but
they
have
the
appearance
of
being
slightly
blighted
nobody
is
too
much
in
earnest
or
too
much
alive
or
too
happy
the
general
atmosphere
is
that
of
depression
they
are
bound
to
have
no
thought
for
the
world
they
have
quitted
however
pleasant
it
may
have
been
to
ignore
all
ties
and
affections
to
have
no
care
but
for
one
individual
alone
and
that
the
master
but
if
you
became
acquainted
with
some
of
these
very
women
under
favorable
conditions
very
rare
however
you
might
gather
glimpses
of
recollections
of
the
outer
world
of
earlier
life
and
strong
affections
of
hearts
scarred

disfigured

broken
of
suppressed
sighs

unuttered
sobs
that
would
dispose
you
to
melancholy
reflections
and
sad
forebodings
and
if
you
were
by
nature
tender
to
shedding
of
tears
their
dress
and
manners
often
betray
all
sorts
of
peculiarities
and
yet
all
is
harmonious
outwardly
they
are
unconscious
of
the
terrible
defacement
they
have
undergone
yet
it
sometimes
happens
that
this

little
world
has
its
greatness
and
always
when
a
woman
becomes
a
mother
her
life
changes
she
passes
from
the
ignoble
to
the

she

betook
themselves
to
their

very
soon
the
rumor
of
her
great
beauty
having
spread
nearly
all
the
lovely
girls
in
the
harem
rushed
in
to
get
a
glimpse
of
her
but
finding
her
closely
veiled
and
that
no
persuasion
could
prevail
with
her
to
uncover
her
face
they
gradually
departed
one
young
woman
only
remaining
behind
sitting
apart
in
silent
sympathy
after
a
while
two
female
physicians
came
in
talking
in
low
tones
one
to
the
other
they
then
proceeded
to
question
the

and
to
all
of
their
questions
she
returned
modest
replies
after
they
were
satisfied
they
bade
her
unrobe
which
she
did
with
some
little
hesitancy
when
she
laid
aside
her
veil
her
eyes
met
those
of
her
silent
visitor
an
indescribable
something
beamed
from
every
feature
of
the
stranger
and
they
became
friends
the
physicians
then
examined
the
girl
just
as
if
she
were
an
animal
having
finished
their
inventory
of
her
perfections
and
imperfections
they
dropped
a

when
another

to

she
rose
and
went
out
holding
her
new

hand
after
passing
through
a
dark
and
silent
street
they
brought
her
to
a
marble
building
with
baths
and

all
round
it
here
she
was
again
told
to
undress
and
take
her
place
on

couch
with

pleadingly
besought
her

to
stay

against

with

when

was

besmeared
they
suspended
their
labors
in

to
let
the
stuff
dry
on
the
poor
girl
who
knew
no
more
what
was
going
to
be
done
to
her
than
if
she
had
been
a
little
kitten
and
as
she
sat
there
her
skin
glowing
and
her
heart
palpitating
she
heard
herself
discussed
by
the
bathers
whose
language
she
only
partially
understood
but
she
heard
enough
to
realize
the
life
in
store
for
herself
after
half
an
hour
they
seized
her
again
rubbed
off
briskly
the
dried

and

buckets
of

and
cold
water
upon

her
in

robes
like
those
worn
by
the

of

rank
her
hair
was
combed
perfumed
and
ornamented
with

finally
she
was

rather
have

cowered
down
in
a
corner
and
laid
her
tired
head
in
the
lap
of
her
new
friend
who
began
patting
and
soothing
her
without
uttering
a
single
word
most
girls
as
soon
as
they
have
overcome
the
horror
which
such
a
life
must
naturally
inspire
in
the
young

enthusiastic
begin
to
calculate
on
their
chances
of
promotion
to
the
highest
place
in
the
harem
as
for
smâyâtee
no
thought
but
of
escape
presented
itself
to
her
mind
her
nature
was
too
wild
and
untamed
to
be
flattered
by
the
luxuries
that
now
surrounded
her
she
looked
upon
them
only
as
so
many
fetters
all
kinds
of
wild
plans
for
running
away
took
violent
possession
of
her
brain
but
the
soothing
influence
of
the
bath
combined
with
the
exhaustion
of
the
day
overcame
her
and
she
was

asleep

to

filled

from

which
was
a

gray
his
wrinkled
brow
his
livid

and
watery
eyes
there
breathed
forth
an
atmosphere
which
would

repelled

black
outline
of
the
distant
hills
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
in
fits
and
starts
and
snatches
came
sweeping
up
the
river
and
tossed
its
waters
wildly
against
the
banks
then
flashed
incessant
lightnings
and
the
winds
rang
and
roared
as
though
they
heralded
with
joy
the
coming
suddenly
the
moon
was
blurred
with
clouds
and
the
tempest
raged
outright
in
the
midst
of
the
storm
the
poor
terrified
girl
was
roused
from
her
slumbers
led
to
the
lofty
chamber
and
left
alone
while
the
attendants
retired
to
one
of
the
little
alcoves
to
be
in
waiting
rama
who
had
that
day
made
a
circuit
of
the
walls
and
had
promenaded
every
nook
and
corner
in
the
vain
hope
of
finding
some
means
of
getting
unseen
into
the
duke
palace
had
hired
a
boat
and
was
sailing
wildly
up
and
down
the
river
in
front
of
it
laying
desperate
plans
of
finding
his
daughter
and
carrying
her
off
at
any
risk
and
peril
was
at
the
same
moment
by
one
mighty
sweep
of
the
water
dashed
on
the
banks
that
bounded
on
one
side
the
gardens
and
temples
of
the
palace
he
staggered
to
his
feet
and
raised
his
head
to
the
dreadful
sky
a
sudden
flash
of
lightning
revealed
the
gilded
top
of
the
lofty
summer
tower
and
the
tapering
summits
of
the
buddhist
and
hindoo
temples
with
a
dreadful
purpose
burning
in
his
heart
he
walked
straight
on
to
the
latter
building
which
was
dimly
lighted
and
stood
open
as
if
inviting
him
to
take
shelter
under
its
sacred
roof
he
entered
happy
memories
every
sweet
emotion
he
had
known
came
crowding
upon
him
as
he
once
more
recognized
in
the
partial
darkness
the
faint
outlines
of
the
images
of
his
gods
dâvee
and
indra
and
dhupiyâ
there
is
compensation
in
all
things
he
had
lost
his
child
and
found
his
gods
joy
and
sorrow
are
bound
up
in
every
event
of
life
even
as
opposite
poles
are
inseparable
in
the
magnet
the
pity
is
that
the
night
of
trouble
is
at
times
so
dark
that
the
interwoven
gold
with
which
providence
relieves
the
woof
of
calamity
remains
undiscovered
thus
it
was
with
rama
there
was
joy
and
sorrow
in
his
heart
as
he
bowed
before
the
gods
of
his
fathers
but
there
was
hatred
and
revenge
there
too
mingled
with
dark
and
bloody
thoughts
life
is
now
a
useless
gift
an
insupportable
burden
groaned
rama
in
how
many
lives
there
lurks
a
hidden
romance
or
a
hidden
terror
no
one
was
near
to
mark
the
secret
workings
of
this
terrible
man
nature
he
recalled
his
home
on
the
hills
of
orissa
the
yearly
sacrifice
that
his
fathers
had
been
wont
to
offer
up
on
dâvee
altar
and
he
suddenly
resolved
that
he
would
himself
be
the
sacrifice
to
his
and
neglected
gods
only
one
person
could
have
saved
him
from
his
rash
purpose
and
she
was
sitting
up
there
alone
midway
between
earth
and
heaven
he
slowly
drew
out
from
his
cumberbund
a
glittering
knife
and
his
expression
became
exultant
as
he
felt
its
sharp
edge
not
all
the
gods
not
all
the
eyes
not
all
the
hills
of
orissa
can
move
him
from
his
purpose
now
he
laid
the
knife
upon
the
altar
and
cried
aloud
to
the
insatiable
earth
goddess
o
dâvee
thou
hast
been
unworshipped
for
years
multitudes
crowd
thy
sister
temples
but
thine
they
pass
unnoticed
by
behold
my
child
now
in
the
grasp
of
the
spoiler
defend
preserve
her
that
her
honor
may
shine
bright
among
men
and
i
will
pour
out
to
thee
the
life
of
my
heart
drink
of
my
blood
and
be
revenged
on
the
defiler
of
my
house
and
my
race
then
snatching
up
the
knife
he
waved
it
thrice
over
his
head
and
thrust
it
into
his
side
leaning
forward
he
tried
to
picture
his
child
face
but
could
not
for
the
light
that
love
threw
around
her
and
the
mist
that
death
wrapped
round
him
he
drew
nearer
to
his
childhood
god
and
drawing
out
the
knife
fell
down
at
its
feet
turning
up
his
face
to
it
reverently
lovingly
and
there
was
joy
joy
of
conscious
strength
of
victory
mingling
with
the
of
the
heart
that
was
fast
flowing
away
forever
it
is
two
the
night
is
changed
the
storms
and
clouds
and
darkness
are
all
dispersed
the
blue
sky
has
thrown
aside
her
veils
and
the
moon
rides
serenely
in
limitless
range
undimmed
by
a
single
fleck
of
cloud
the
very
air
breathes
sweetness
and
perfume
and
peace
but
of
all
the
mysteries
of
the
night
there
is
one
yet
to
be
solved
smâyâtee
still
sits
on
one
of
the
sills
of
the
arches
in
the
topmost
chamber
of
the
summer
tower
nearest
to
where
the
women
have
retired
out
of
sight
she
hears
them
whispering
she
hears
too
some
one
slowly
mounting
the
stairs
the
footsteps
are
heavy
and
sound
like
those
of
an
aged
man
she
looks
around
to
see
if
there
is
any
way
by
which
she
may
escape
the
tower
has
but
a
single
spiral
stairway
she
remains
still
and
motionless
in
a
few
minutes
the
sound
of
the
footsteps
comes
nearer
through
the
archway
opposite
the
tottering
figure
of
a
dark
heavy
man
enters
and
approaches
her
in
the
dim
light
she
looks
up
at
him
with
a
pleading
face
daring
neither
to
breathe
nor
speak
she
shrinks
away
to
the
other
side
where
the
women
are
in
waiting
the
duke
rather
admiring
her
coyness
laughs
a
drunken
laugh
and
attempts
to
follow
her
in
crossing
the
threshold
he
stumbles
in
trying
to
recover
his
footing
he
is
thrown
back
his
head
strikes
violently
against
a
massive
gold
spittoon
a
wild
cry
and
smâyâtee
rushes
from
her
springs
across
the
prostrate
figure
down
the
flights
of
stairs
and
through
the
labyrinths
of
flowering
shrubs
and
plants
to
hide
herself
beside
a
low
tank
of
water
the
attendants
and
slaves
who
were
lying
around
heard
wild
cries
for
help
proceeding
from
the
summer
tower
and
hurried
to
the
spot
with
lamps
and
lanterns
all
the
piazzas
streets
gardens
and
avenues
are
alive
with
anxious
faces
and
inquiring
looks
the
duchess
fears
are
aroused
she
too
summons
her
maidens
with
their
lanterns
and
sets
out
for
the
tower
suddenly
she
stops
a
few
steps
from
her
she
sees
an
object
dressed
in
bright
colors
crouching
in
a
pool
of
by
the
tank
she
stooped
to
scrutinize
the
figure
and
found
it
was
that
of
a
young
and
strange
girl
she
bent
over
her
again
and
said
gently
why
art
thou
hiding
here
my
child
i
am
afraid
of
him
dear
lady
replied
the
girl
pointing
to
the
lofty
chamber
afraid
art
thou
indeed
said
she
a
little
coldly
remembering
the
news
of
the
day
didst
thou
not
sell
thyself
to
the
duke
in
spite
of
thy
father
wishes
o
yes
i
did
dear
lady
replied
smâyâtee
but
and
she
began
to
cry
bitterly
and
could
not
say
another
word
for
her
tears
and
sobs
the
true
woman
triumphed
in
the
wife
for
she
put
out
her
arms
and
raised
the
forlorn
stranger
to
her
bosom
and
comforted
her
with
such
words
as
women
who
have
great
and
loving
hearts
only
can
then
confiding
her
to
the
tender
care
of
her
own
women
she
went
on
her
way
to
find
out
the
meaning
of
those
dreadful
cries
nai
dhamaphat
who
had
been
watching
in
sadness
and
despair
the
marvellous
expression
of
nature
tears
and
smiles
was
the
first
to
mount
the
spiral
staircase
to
find
his
father
in
the
last
agonies
of
death
he
takes
him
up
gently
with
the
assistance
of
the
women
and
places
him
on
his
luxurious
couch
the
duke
is
dead
everything
is
forgotten
he
sees
the
pale
face
of
the
duchess
his
mother
that
silent
woman
and
catching
a
glimpse
of
the
bitter
sorrow
of
that
patient
soul
who
was
so
worthy
of
his
father
love
in
her
right
of
youth
and
beauty
the
foremost
to
love
him
the
last
and
only
woman
of
all
those
whom
he
had
wronged
to
mourn
him
he
bows
his
head
and
weeps
the
son
and
the
mother
are
drawn
closer
than
ever
they
two
had
suffered
in
silence
apart
now
they
sorrowed
together

weeping
may
endure
for
a
night

joy
cometh
in
the
morning
a
year
has
passed
since
the
occurrence
of
the
fearful
events
here
related
the
river
in
front
of
the
palace
is
thronged
with
a
numerous
procession
of
gayly
gilded
boats
and
barges
it
is
the
morning
after
the
cremation
of
the
duke

the

with
sixty
or
more
nobles
and
princes
of
the
land
all
armed
and
in
regal
attire
presides
in
the
grand
hall
of
the
late
palace
the
duchess
and
her
two
sons
and
a
fair
sprinkling
of
siamese
ladies
and
children
are
here
assembled
a
vast
number
of
serfs
soldiers
pages
and
women
are
in
waiting
around
the
deep
embrasure
formed
by
the
windows
in
the
massive
wall
there
ran
a
low
seat
the
space
thus
occupied

raised
as
a
kind
of
dais
above
the
general
level
of
the
floor
here
were
seated
on
either
side
of
the
wall
the
principal
officers
male
and
female
of
the
household
headed
by
the
priests
of
brahma
and
of
buddha
who
were
to
play
a
part
in
the
important
drama
of
the
day
the
hall
is
hung
with
tapestry
of
the
most
original
design
for
the
birds
and
beasts
and
flowers
which
are
pictured
there
had
surely
never
prototypes
unless
in
some
lost
geological
formation
though
patterns
very
like
them
seemed
to
be
unanimously
adopted
as
models
by
all
the
fair
embroideresses
of
siam
in
the
middle
of
the
dais
were
two
ducal
chairs
of

on

was
seated
a

closely
veiled

young

over
them
is
spread
a
canopy
of

muslin
decorated
with

sweetest
white
flowers
the
girl
beneath
her
white
veil
thinks
it
all
perfection
and
her
eyes
light
up
and
her
cheeks
burn
and
her
heart
beats
in
perplexing
fashion
and
dhamaphat
believes
that
he
alone
holds
the
key
to
the
temple
of
elysium
it
is
one
of
those
rare
occasions
when
the
whole
assembly
is
rapt
in
the
regions
of
fancy
the
old
priest
chow
sâduman
is
there
too
and
he
often
raises
his
eyes
in
admiration
and
his
heart
in
prophecy
of
a
propitious
marriage
at
length
he
begins
the
grand
old
harmonious
nuptial
chant
and
all
the
priests
of
buddha
and
of
brahma
join
in
sonorous
concert
and
through
the
canopy
over
the
happy
couple
the
typical
waters
of
consecration
in
which
had
been
previously
infused
certain
leaves
and

the
favorite
of
the
harem
the
morning
on
which
his
majesty
set
out
on
his
annual
visit
to
pitchaburee
was
one
of
those
which
occur
in
the
climate
of
siam
at
almost
any
season
of
the
year
but
are
seen
in
their
perfection
only
in
october
the
earth
air
and
sky
seemed
to
bask
in
a
glory
of
sunlight
and
beauty
and
everything
that
had
life
gave
signs
of
perfect
and
tranquil
enjoyment
not
a
sound
broke
the
stillness
and
there
seemed
nothing
to
do
but
to
sit
and
watch
the
long
shadows
sleeping
on
the
distant
hills
and
on
the
warm
golden
fields
of
waving
corn
reluctantly
quitting
my
window
i
turned
my
steps
toward
the
palace
leaving
all
this
beauty
behind
me
in
a
kind
of
despair
not
that
my
temple
was
not
in
itself
a
delicious
retreat
but
that
it
always
impressed
me
with
a
feeling
i
could
never
analyze
when
there
it
seemed
as
if
i
were
removed
to
some
awful
distance
from
the
world
i
had
known
and
were
yet
more
remotely
excluded
from
any
participation
in
its
real
life
taking
out
my
book
i
sat
down
to
await
the
coming
of
such
of
my
pupils
as
might
not
have
accompanied
the
king
on
his
visit
in
the
course
of
an
hour
only
one
presented
herself
she
was
a
young
woman
called
choy
a
fair
and
very
handsome
girl
of
about
twenty
summers
or
perhaps
not
so
many
with
regular
features
a
very
rare
thing
in
a
siamese
woman
but
the
great
beauty
of
her
face
was
in
her
large
lustrous
eyes
which
were
very
eloquent
even
in
their
seeming
indifference
her
hair
which
was
so
long
that
when
unbound
it
covered
her
whole
person
even
to
her
feet
was
tied
in
a
large
knot
behind
and
ornamented
with
the
jessamine
and
indian
myrtle
she
had
a
careless
and
i
might
almost
say
even
a
wicked
expression
in
her
face
which
was
slightly
marked
with
the
smallpox
choy
was
the
youngest
sister
of
the
head
wife
or
concubine
thieng
and
had
been
my
pupil
for
about
six
months
this
morning
she
brought
me
a
flower
it
was
a
common
that
grew
up
everywhere
in
great
profusion
making
a
lovely
carpet
blossoming
as
it
did
in
every
nook
and
crevice
of
the
stone
pavements
within
the
palace
it
was
just
like
her
to
snatch
up
the
first
thing
that
attracted
her
and
then
to
give
it
away
the
very
next
moment
but
i
received
it
with
pleasure
and
made
a
place
for
her
at
my
side
she
seemed
to
be
out
of
humor
and
jerking
herself
impatiently
into
the
seat
said
abruptly
why
you
despise
me
as
all
the
rest
of
them
do
then
without
waiting
for
an
answer
she
went
on
to
say
i
ca
be
what
you
wish
me
to
be
not
coming
to
school
any
more
here
my
book
i
do
want
it
i
hate
english
why
choy
what
is
the
matter
i
inquired
i
am
tired
of
trying
to
do
so
much
i
am
not
going
to
learn
english
any
more
she
replied
do
say
so
choy
i
said
kindly
you
ca
do
everything
at
once
you
must
learn
by
degrees
and
little
by
little
you
know
no
one
grows
good
or
clever
at
once
but
i
wo
learn
any
more
even
to
grow
good
and
clever
there
no
use
no
one
will
ever
care
for
me
or
love
me
again
i
wish
they
had
let
me
die
that
time
she
continued
bah
i
could
kill
that
stupid
old
consul
who
saved
my
life
it
were
better
to
be
quartered
and
cast
to
the
crows
and
vultures
than
to
live
here
every
one
orders
me
about
as
if
i
were
a
slave
and
treats
me
like
a
dog
i
wish
i
could
drown
myself
and
die
but
choy
you
are
here
now
and
you
must
try
to
bear
it
more
bravely
than
you
do
i
said
not
fully
understanding
the
passionate
nature
of
the
woman
mam
she
said
suddenly
laying
her
hand
upon
my
arm
what
would
you
do
if
you
were
in
my
place
and
like
me
like
you
choy
i
do
quite
understand
you
you
must
explain
yourself
before
i
can
answer
you
listen
then
she
said
passionately
and
i
will
tell
you
when
i
was
hardly
ten
years
old
o
it
seems
such
a
long
long
time
ago
my
mother
presented
me
her
favorite
child
as
a
to
his
majesty
i
was
immediately
handed
over
to
that
vicious
old
woman
khoon
som
sak
who
was
at
that
time
the
chief
teacher
of
the
dramatic
art
in
the
palace
she
is
very
clever
and
knows
all
the
ancient
epic
poems
by
heart
especially
the
rāmāyānā
which
his
majesty
delighted
to
see
dramatized
under
her
tuition
we
were
subjected
to
the
most
rigorous
training
mentally
and
physically
we
were
compelled
to
leap
and
jump
to
twist
and
contort
our
bodies
and
bend
our
arms
fingers
and
ankles
in
every
direction
till
we
became
so
supple
that
we
were
almost
like
young
canes
of
rattan
and
could
assume
any
posture
the
old
hag
pleased
then
we
had
to
learn
long
passages
from
all
sorts
of
poets
by
heart
with
perfect
correctness
for
if
we
ever
forgot
even
a
single
word
or
did
not
put
it
in
its
right
place
we
were
severely
beaten
what
with
recitations
singing
dancing
playing
and
beating
time
with
our
feet
we
had
a
hard
life
of
it
and
it
was
no
play
for
our
instructress
either
for
there
were
seventy
of
us
girls
to
be
initiated
into
all
the
mysteries
of
the
siamese
drama
at
length
with
some
of
my
companions
i
was
pronounced
perfect
in
the
art
and
was
permitted
to
enter
my
name
among
the
envied
few
who
played
and
danced
and
acted
before
the
king
i
would
not
have
you
think
that
the
tasks
imposed
upon
me
were
always
irksome
or
that
i
have
always
felt
so
depressed
and
unworthy
as
i
do
now
the
study
of
the
poets
and
above
all
of
the
rāmāyānā
opened
to
me
a
new
world
as
it
were
and
it
was
a
great
gain
to
have
even
this
with
the
yearning
for
life
in
the
outer
world
that
it
inspired
it
helped
me
to
live
in
a
world
of
my
own
creation
a
world
of
love
music
and
song
rama
was
my
hero
and
i
imagined
myself
the
fair
and
beautiful
sita
his
wife
i
particularly
delighted
to
act
that
part
of
the
poem
describing
rama
expedition
to
lanka
to
rescue
sita
from
the
tyrant
râwânâ
and
their
delicious
meeting
in
the
garden
where
rama
greets
her
with
those
beautiful
lines
what
joy
abundant
treasures
i
have
won
again
o
what
joy
of
sita
yanee
now
the
prize
is
mine
o
what
joy
again
thou
livest
within
this
breast
so
mighty
armed
with
love
and
with
the
wealth
of
heaven
beyond
soon
shall
sita
indara
fairest
daughter
stand
by
my
side
as
stands
her
matchless
mother
aspārā
in
heaven
refulgent
by
the
great
indara
my
face
is
slightly
i
know
but
when
painted
and
dressed
in
the
court
jewels
i
looked
remarkably
well
as
sita
with
my
hair
floating
away
over
my
shoulders
and
down
to
my
feet
bound
only
by
an
exquisite
crown
of
gold
such
as
sita
is
supposed
to
have
worn
on
the
very
first
occasion
of
my
performing
before
the
king
i
had
to
take
part
in
this
drama
as
soon
as
we
had
got
through
the
first
scene
the
king
inquired
my
name
and
age
this
set
my
heart
beating
in
great
wild
throbs
all
through
the
rest
of
the
play
but
after
this
weeks
passed
by
and
i
heard
nothing
more
from
his
majesty
he
had
forgotten
me
i
grew
tired
of
reciting
and
keeping
time
and
singing
my
sweetest
songs
for
no
one
amusement
but
that
of
the
old
hag
who
made
me
work
like
a
slave
for
the
benefit
of
the
rest
of
her
pupils
i
began
to
wish
there
would
be
some
great
outside
of
the
palace
where
all
the
court
nobles
and
princes
and
the
king
would
assemble
and
where
i
could
act
sita
and
sing
like
narawèke
and
dance
like
thawadee
then
father
and
mother
might
see
me
too
and
o
how
pleased
they
would
be
i
thought
you
do
not
know
how
dull
it
is
to
be
acting
before
women
and
with
women
only
dressed
in
robes
of
kings
and
princesses
if
it
were
only
a
real
king
or
a
prince
or
even
a
noble
it
would
not
be
quite
so
bad
but
all
that
mockery
of
love
bah
it
is
too
stupid
i
was
sick
of
my
life
i
wished
mother
had
kept
me
at
home
instead
of
chand
i
could
then
have
done
just
what
i
had
a
mind
to
and
have
been
just
as
gay
and
idle
as
she
was
well
the
day
came
at
last
i
was
all
but
sixteen
when
that
great
and
eventful
day
arrived
the
was
in
honor
of
the
king
though
i
had
performed
several
times
at
the
court
his
majesty
had
taken
no
further
notice
of
me
and
i
was
sorely
discontented
with
myself
piqued
at
the
indifference
of
the
king
and
enraged
against
the
old
ladies
who
seized
every
opportunity
to
snub
me
and
take
down
my
pride
declaring
that
a
face
was
not
a
fit
offering
for
the
king
the
day
arrived
at
length
how
elated
i
was
i
had
to
represent
the
character
of
the
wondrously
beautiful
queen
thèwâdee
in
one
of
those
ancient
dramas
of
maha
nagkhon
watt
whose
beauty
is
said
to
have
entranced
even
the
wild
beasts
of
the
forest
so
that
they
forgot
to
seize
upon
their
prey
as
her
shadow
passed
near
them
my
dress
was
of
magnificent
silk
and
gold
covered
with
precious
gems
my
crown
was
an
antique
and
lovely
coronet
one
that
had
graced
the
brows
of
the
queens
of
cambodia
it
was
richly
studded
with
rubies
and
diamonds
the
first
day
of
my
rehearsal
in
this
costume
all
my
companions
declared
that
i
looked
enchantingly
beautiful
that
my
fortune
was
made
and
that
if
i
would
only
look
and
act
thus
i
could
not
fail
to
captivate
the
king
the
bare
idea
of
being
elevated
above
my
hateful
old
teacher
and
above
some
of
the
proud
women
who
domineered
over
me
half
intoxicated
me
in
this
mood
i
began
to
realize
my
future
as
already
at
hand
and
growing
impatient
with
my
doubts
and
fears
i
sought
at
nightfall
a
crafty
old
female
astrologer
named
khoon
hate
nah
she
took
me
into
a
dark
and
dismal
cell
underground
and
putting
her
ear
to
my
side
numbered
the
pulsation
of
my
heart
for
a
whole
hour
she
then
bound
my
eyes
and
bade
me
select
one
of
the
dark
books
that
lay
around
me
this
done
she
expounded
to
me
my
whole
future
out
of
her
mysterious
book
of
fate
in
which
all
my
romantic
visions
of
greatness
were
as
clearly
predicted
as
if
the
old
fiend
himself
had
revealed
to
her
my
secret
and
innermost
thoughts
i
was
troubled
only
at
one
part
of
the
old
woman
revelations
which
said
that
though
i
was
destined
to
rise
to
the
greatest
honors
in
the
realm
a
certain
malignant
star
which
would
greatly
influence
my
destiny
would
be
in
ascendency
during
the
month
of
duenjee
and
that
if
i
neglected
to
pass
the
whole
of
that
period
in
deep
fasting
prayer
and
meditation
i
should
sink
at
once
from
the
highest
pinnacle
of
my
grandeur
into
the
lowest
and
most
terrible
abyss
i
resolved
that
i
would
fast
and
pray
for
that
entire
month
every
year
of
my
life
how
i
wish
now
that
i
had
never
consulted
the
old
hag
because
my
confidence
in
her
predictions
made
me
proud
and
defiant
to
the
old
duennas
who
are
now
my
bitterest
enemies
alas
dear
father
and
mother
it
were
better
to
have
cast
your
daughter
choy
into
the
mèinam
than
to
have
given
her
to
amuse
a
king
on
the
day
of
the
i
awoke
at
five
in
the
morning
and
began
anointing
my
person
with
the
perfumes
and
unguents
provided
for
us
at
the
king
expense
i
then
spent
the
rest
of
the
forenoon
in
making
my
hair
glossy
and
lustrous
which
i
did
by
rubbing
it
with
the
oil
of
the
doksarathe
how
i
gloried
and
exulted
to
see
it
floating
away
in
long
shining
masses
waving
over
my
shoulders
and
covering
my
feet
the
afternoon
came
and
with
it
the
old
hags
bearing
my
dress
and
the
costly
jewels
i
was
to
appear
in
they
opened
the
box
and
laid
them
before
me
i
had
never
seen
anything
so
beautiful
the
boxes
absolutely
sparkled
like
the
stars
of
heaven
in
one
blaze
of
light
and
beauty
when
i
saw
these
jewels
i
was
seized
with
a
fit
of
temporary
madness
i
could
not
help
skipping
and
dancing
in
a
sort
of
frenzy
about
my
chamber
saying
all
sorts
of
absurd
things
and
foretelling
my
future
triumphs
my
looked
on
amazed
at
the
wildness
of
my
spirits
and
as
for
the
old
women
who
had
the
care
of
robing
me
for
the
evening
they
were
wrathful
and
silent
illustration
a
royal
actress
we
were
all
ready
at
last
a
small
gilt
chariot
of
a
form
made
of
ivory
and
decorated
with
garlands
and
crowns
of
flowers
drawn
by
a
pair
of
ponies
and
attended
by
amazons
dressed
superbly
in
green
and
gold
conveyed
me
as
the
queen
thèwâdee
to
the
grand
hall
where
we
were
to
perform
my
companions
similarly
attended
followed
me
on
foot
his
majesty
the
princes
and
princesses
surrounded
by
all
the
courtiers
were
already
there
the
king
and
royal
family
were
seated
on
a
raised
dais
under
a
tapering
golden
canopy
the
moment
the
king
saw
me
approach
my
ponies
led
gently
forward
by
amazons
he
rose
and
before
the
whole
court
of
lords
and
nobles
and
princes
assembled
inquired
my
name
of
one
of
the
duennas
this
recalled
me
once
more
to
his
memory
for
he
said
aloud
we
remember
she
is
the
one
who
dances
so
beautifully
o
what
a
moment
of
triumph
that
was
for
me
i
felt
as
if
my
heart
in
its
wild
ecstatic
throbs
would
burst
through
its
gorgeous
fetters
of
silk
and
gold
i
rose
up
in
my
chariot
and
bowed
low
before
him
three
times
how
now
he
exclaimed
angrily
looking
around
are
the
nobles
who
are
to
lead
the
ponies
let
those
amazons
fall
back
to
the
right
and
left
in
an
instant
there
emerged
from
the
crowd
two
most
noblemen
dressed
in
flowing
white
robes
threaded
with
gold
and
sparkling
with
gems
they
took
their
places
beside
the
ponies
on
either
side
of
my
chariot
one
was
râtani
the
other
was
a
stranger
to
me
they
did
homage
to
me
as
if
i
were
a
real
queen
and
stationed
themselves
at
my
ponies
heads
at
this
moment
i
was
saluted
with
a
burst
of
music
and
the
curtain
fell
râtani
bent
his
head
close
to
mine
and
whispered
beautiful
thou
art
i
turned
a
frowning
look
upon
him
for
his
presumption
and
replied
a
care
my
lord
a
word
from
me
may
be
too
much
for
thee
but
he
immediately
assumed
so
humble
and
penitent
an
expression
that
i
forgave
him
i
was
both
flattered
and
piqued
however
at
the
other
nobleman
conduct
for
though
he
looked
admiringly
at
me
he
said
not
a
word
i
would
have
given
my
eyes
if
it
had
been
he
who
said
i
was
beautiful
for
there
was
a
majesty
of
youth
strength
and
manly
beauty
about
him
that
made
a
blinding
radiance
around
my
chariot
and
excited
an
oblivious
rapture
in
my
heart
i
panted
i
was
athirst
for
one
word
of
recognition
from
him
at
length
i
became
so
vexed
at
his
silence
that
i
asked
him
what
he
was
looking
at
he
replied
more
cautiously
than
his
companion
i
thought
that
i
beheld
an
angel
of
light
but
thy
voice
recalls
me
to
the
earth
again
i
was
so
enraptured
at
this
speech
that
i
could
hardly
contain
myself
a
flood
of
delight
swept
over
me
my
breast
heaved
my
eyes
glowed
my
lips
parted
my
color
came
and
went
through
the
cream
that
covered
my
face
and
concealed
my
only
deformity
when
the
curtain
rose
i
with
this
new
life
rushing
through
my
veins
looked
triumphantly
at
the
troop
of
my
companions
who
did
me
homage
this
new
existence
made
me
so
joyous
that
i
must
have
been
beautiful
thus
inspired
i
acted
my
part
so
wondrously
well
that
a
deep
murmur
of
applause
ran
throughout
the
hall
his
majesty
eyes
were
riveted
upon
me
in
startled
astonishment
and
evident
admiration
i
acted
my
part
with
a
keen
sense
of
its
reality
and
gave
utterance
to
the
burning
passion
of
my
heart
as
if
i
were
really
a
queen
i
commanded
my
courtiers
to
drive
away
the
suitors
who
wooed
me
declaring
that
anything
beneath
royalty
would
stain
my
queenly
dignity
and
beauty
but
when
the
banished
prince
my
lover
appeared
i
rose
hastily
from
my
gilded
and
ivory
chariot
and
with
my
hair
floating
round
my
form
like
a
deep
lustrous
veil
through
which
the
gems
on
my
robe
shone
out
like
glorious
stars
of
a
dark
night
i
laid
myself
like
the
uprooted
prostrate
at
his
feet
i
pronounced
his
name
in
the
most
tender
accents
i
improvised
verses
even
more
passionate
than
those
contained
in
the
drama
i
knew
my
lord
as
the
heat
betrays
the
fire
when
through
the
obscuring
earth
unclouded
shining
out
thou
didst
appear
worthy
of
all
joy
my
soul
is
wrung
with
rapture
and
it
quivers
in
thy
presence
as
the
lotus
petals
before
a
mighty
wind
the
courtiers
raised
me
up
from
the
floor
and
led
me
back
to
the
chariot
the
prince
who
was
no
other
than
took
his
or
more
properly
her
place
beside
me
and
the
curtain
fell
the
play
was
over
with
nothing
but
the
memory
of
a
look
i
returned
to
my
now
still
more
dismal
rooms
i
disrobed
myself
of
all
my
glittering
ornaments
with
a
sigh
bound
up
my
long
shining
hair
and
sat
down
to
enjoy
the
only
happiness
left
me
my
proud
swelling
thoughts
i
was
just
losing
myself
in
soft
delicious
reveries
which
illuminated
as
with
a
celestial
light
the
whole
world
within
me
when
i
observed
a
couple
of
old
duennas
who
came
fawning
upon
me
caressing
and
praising
me
while
telling
me
that
his
majesty
had
ordered
that
i
should
be
in
attendance
in
his
that
evening
i
listened
in
mute
pain
the
power
of
the
new
passion
that
now
filled
my
heart
seemed
to
defy
all
authority
and
the
very
thing
for
which
i
had
so
long
worked
and
longed
had
become
valueless
and
as
nothing
to
me
but
i
dared
not
excuse
myself
so
i
silently
followed
my
conductresses
and
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
ascended
to
his
majesty
private
how
changed
i
was
that
which
had
been
my
sole
ambition
ever
since
i
was
ten
years
old
came
down
upon
me
with
a
gush
of
woe
that
i
could
hardly
have
believed
myself
capable
of
feeling
i
sat
down
to
await
the
coming
of
the
king
but
i
could
have
plucked
out
the
heart
that
had
rushed
so
madly
on
casting
its
young
life
away
at
the
feet
of
a
man
whose
name
even
i
did
not
know
whose
face
i
had
not
seen
till
that
day
but
the
tones
of
whose
voice
were
still
sounding
through
and
through
my
quivering
pulses
well
my
forehead
if
not
my
heart
i
laid
at
his
majesty
feet
am
your
slave
my
lord
said
my
voice
the
sound
of
which
startled
my
own
ears
so
hollow
and
deceptive
did
it
seem
you
know
how
fascinating
you
were
this
evening
said
the
king
by
forty
years
than
my
father
thought
i
as
dissembling
still
i
replied
slave
does
not
know
you
were
and
i
am
sure
you
deserve
to
be
a
queen
he
added
trying
to
play
the
gallant
lord
is
too
gracious
to
his
slave
i
murmured
thieng
he
said
speaking
to
my
eldest
sister
have
you
hidden
this
beauty
away
from
me
so
long
let
her
not
be
called
choy
any
longer
but
chorm
i
would
weary
you
if
i
tried
to
tell
you
how
he
praised
and
flattered
me
and
how
before
a
week
was
over
i
was
the
proudest
woman
in
the
palace
i
became
a
stranger
to
my
dismal
rooms
in
the
street
to
my
as
well
as
to
my
companions
i
lived
entirely
in
his
majesty
apartments
and
it
was
only
when
he
was
asleep
or
in
the
council
hall
that
i
rushed
down
to
plunge
into
the
or
to
ramble
in
the
but
i
never
stopped
to
think
i
would
not
give
my
heart
a
moment
to
reflect
not
a
moment
to
the
past
not
a
moment
to
the
future
i
was
intoxicated
with
the
present
every
day
gifts
rare
and
costly
were
brought
to
me
from
the
king
i
affected
to
despise
them
but
he
never
relaxed
his
endeavors
to
suit
my
taste
to
match
my
hair
and
my
complexion
the
late
proud
insolent
favorite
who
used
to
order
us
girls
about
as
if
we
were
dogs
knelt
before
me
as
half
from
and
half
from
coquetry
i
feigned
illness
and
inability
to
rise
from
my
master
couch
i
can
not
tell
you
how
well
i
acted
my
part
i
was
more
daring
than
any
favorite
had
yet
been
in
the
tumult
and
excess
of
the
passion
i
felt
for
a
stranger
i
was
able
to
make
the
king
believe
that
he
was
himself
its
object
and
he
was
so
flattered
at
my
seeming
admiration
and
devotion
that
he
called
me
by
the
tender
name
child
and
indulged
me
in
all
my
whims
and
fancies
but
at
length
i
grew
tired
of
so
much
acting
and
the
intensity
of
my
manner
began
to
flag
i
complained
of
illness
in
order
to
escape
to
my
own
room
where
i
flung
myself
down
upon
my
leather
pillow
and
drove
my
teeth
through
and
through
it
in
the
that
my
falseness
brought
upon
me
i
was
worn
with
woe
more
than
wasted
by
want
of
food
my
sister
observed
my
paleness
and
said
half
in
earnest
and
half
in
jest
take
it
so
much
to
heart
child
we
have
all
had
our
day
it
is
yours
now
but
it
ca
last
forever
remember
there
are
other
growing
up
and
some
of
them
are
handsomer
than
you
are
do
you
mean
i
retorted
fiercely
you
suppose
i
am
sorrowing
because
of
my
grandfather
bah
take
him
if
you
want
him
child
she
replied
do
forget
that
you
are
in
a
den
or
tiger
i
said
laughing
bitterly
mean
to
play
with
his
fangs
even
if
they
tear
my
heart
until
i
am
rich
as
you
at
least
you
indeed
she
rejoined
quick
then
and
give
him
a
ong
with
that
she
left
me
to
my
own
wild
bitter
maddening
condemning
self
months
of
triumph
rage
agony
and
despair
wore
away
and
my
day
was
not
over
i
was
acknowledged
by
all
to
be
the
wilful
favorite
in
the
mean
time
i
had
one
ray
of
comfort
i
found
out
the
name
of
the
man
i
loved
from
a
new
who
had
just
entered
into
my
service
it
was
chitt
that
very
day
i
took
a
needleful
of
golden
thread
and
worked
the
name
into
a
scrap
of
silk
which
i
made
into
an
amulet
and
wore
round
my
neck
this
greatly
solaced
me
for
a
little
while
after
which
i
began
to
crave
something
more
the
new
who
had
entered
my
service
just
because
i
was
the
favorite
seemed
so
kind
and
attentive
and
was
such
a
comfort
to
me
whenever
i
rushed
to
my
rooms
for
a
respite
that
i
determined
to
employ
her
in
obtaining
information
of
the
outside
world
for
me
to
beguile
me
of
my
weary
hours
i
said
she
seconded
the
idea
with
great
alacrity
whose
house
shall
i
go
first
she
inquired
anywhere
i
replied
carelessly
then
as
if
suddenly
remembering
myself
i
said
boon
go
to
chitt
and
find
out
how
the
groom
of
the
queen
thèwâdee
lives
in
his
harem
when
she
returned
which
was
close
upon
nightfall
i
was
impatient
to
hear
all
she
had
to
tell
me
but
after
she
had
told
me
all
i
became
more
impatient
and
restless
still
her
face
lighted
up
as
she
expatiated
on
the
manly
beauty
of
chitt
and
her
voice
trembled
slightly
she
did
it
on
purpose
i
thought
as
she
went
on
to
say
that
ever
since
the
day
he
had
met
the
lovely
thèwâdee
he
had
become
so
changed
and
had
grown
so
melancholy
that
all
his
dearest
friends
and
relatives
began
to
fear
some
secret
distemper
or
that
some
evil
spirit
had
entered
into
him
this
was
ample
food
for
me
for
months
it
comforted
me
to
think
that
he
shared
my
misery
then
i
drooped
and
languished
once
more
and
began
to
long
for
some
more
tangible
token
of
his
love
for
me
i
grew
bolder
and
bolder
and
the
sympathized
with
my
passion
for
him
at
last
i
sent
her
out
with
a
message
to
him
it
contained
but
two
words
and
he
returned
but
two
more
all
this
while
i
still
visited
the
king
and
was
often
alone
with
him
he
continued
to
indulge
me
giving
me
costly
rings
and
diamond
pins
for
my
hair
every
petition
i
made
to
him
was
granted
every
woman
in
the
palace
stood
in
awe
of
me
not
knowing
how
i
might
use
my
power
and
i
was
proud
and
wilful
my
father
was
created
a
duke
of
the
second
rank
in
the
kingdom
my
brothers
were
appointed
governors
over
lucrative
districts
i
had
nothing
left
to
wish
for
but
a
child
if
i
had
had
a
child
i
might
have
been
saved
a
child
only
could
have
subdued
my
growing
passion
and
given
to
my
life
a
fairer
blossom
and
a
richer
fruit
than
it
now
bears
at
last
i
do
know
what
put
it
into
my
head
but
i
began
to
solace
myself
by
writing
to
chitt
every
day
and
destroying
the
letters
as
soon
as
they
were
written
my
next
step
was
to
send
one
of
these
letters
to
him
by
boon
he
was
very
bold
and
it
makes
my
heart
ache
even
now
to
think
how
brave
and
fearless
he
was
he
wrote
to
me
at
once
and
implored
me
in
a
depth
of
anguish
and
in
words
as
if
on
fire
to
disguise
myself
in
clothes
to
quit
the
palace
and
go
out
to
meet
him
i
burnt
the
letter
as
soon
as
i
had
learned
it
by
heart
my
heart
was
set
on
fire
and
i
pondered
over
and
over
the
proposition
of
my
lover
until
it
became
too
fascinating
for
me
to
resist
much
longer
so
i
took
boon
into
greater
confidence
than
ever
put
a
bag
heavy
with
silver
into
her
hands
and
moreover
promised
her
her
freedom
if
she
would
assist
me
to
escape
the
silver
till
i
ask
you
for
it
lady
she
replied
trust
me
to
help
you
i
will
do
it
with
all
my
heart
her
devotion
and
attachment
surprised
me
it
could
not
have
been
greater
had
she
been
my
own
sister
could
i
have
seen
the
end
i
would
have
stopped
there
i
saw
nothing
but
the
face
that
had
kindled
a
blinding
fire
in
my
heart
the
faithful
boon
served
me
but
too
well
it
was
all
arranged
that
i
should
go
out
at
the
the
next
evening
at
sunset
with
my
hair
cut
off
and
disguised
as
boon
chitt
was
to
be
there
with
a
boat
ready
to
convey
us
to
ayudia
and
boon
was
to
remain
behind
until
the
whole
thing
should
have
blown
over
this
last
was
her
own
proposition
i
tried
in
vain
to
urge
her
to
accompany
us
in
our
flight
she
said
it
would
be
safer
for
us
both
to
have
a
friend
in
the
palace
who
could
give
us
information
of
whatever
took
place
in
the
agitation
in
which
i
wrote
these
last
instructions
to
my
lover
i
made
so
many
blunders
that
i
had
to
write
the
letter
all
over
again
boon
implored
me
to
put
no
name
to
it
for
we
still
feared
some
discovery
i
gave
it
sealed
with
my
ring
to
boon
who
carried
it
off
in
great
delight
and
i
laid
myself
down
upon
my
couch
to
dream
of
an
overflowing
happiness
in
the
blessedness
of
the
great
love
that
absorbed
every
feeling
of
my
heart
i
loved
even
the
king
whom
i
had
most
injured
and
deceived
with
the
loving
devotion
of
a
child
in
the
midst
of
my
ecstatic
dreams
i
fell
asleep
and
dreamed
a
dream
o
so
different
as
plainly
as
one
sees
in
broad
daylight
i
saw
myself
bound
in
chains
and
chitt
flung
down
a
dreadful
precipice
my
chamber
door
was
thrown
rudely
open
i
was
seized
by
cold
hands
harsh
voices
bade
me
rise
and
i
opened
my
eyes
upon
that
woman
who
is
called
by
us
mai
taie
there
was
boon
tied
hand
and
foot
lying
before
my
door
it
was
all
over
with
us
i
could
only
save
him
was
my
only
thought
they
were
putting
chains
on
my
hands
and
jostling
me
about
for
so
benumbed
and
prostrated
was
i
at
the
sight
of
boon
that
i
could
not
rise
i
did
not
dare
to
ask
her
a
single
question
for
fear
of
implicating
ourselves
all
the
more
when
my
sister
thieng
rushed
into
my
room
screaming
flung
herself
upon
my
bed
and
clasped
me
around
the
neck
sister
i
said
these
women
wait
a
little
and
tell
me
how
they
came
to
find
it
out
choy
choy
she
kept
repeating
wringing
her
hands
and
moaning
piteously
thieng
do
you
hear
me
i
do
care
what
they
do
to
me
i
only
want
to
know
how
much
you
know
how
much
knows
copy
of
a
letter
you
wrote
to
some
nobleman
was
picked
up
about
an
hour
ago
and
taken
to
the
chief
judge
she
has
laid
it
before
the
king
then
if
that
is
all
he
does
not
know
the
name
i
said
with
a
sigh
of
deep
relief
but
he
find
it
out
sister
said
thieng
yourself
upon
his
mercy
and
confess
all
for
he
still
loves
you
choy
he
would
hardly
believe
you
had
written
the
letter
boon
said
anything
i
next
inquired
not
a
word
she
is
as
silent
as
death
said
my
sister
where
did
you
get
her
who
is
she
she
was
taken
on
her
return
because
you
had
mentioned
your
slave
boon
in
your
letter
now
i
must
leave
you
and
go
back
to
the
king
said
my
sister
then
weeping
and
abusing
poor
boon
she
went
away
boon
and
i
were
chained
and
dragged
to
the
same
cell
you
visited
the
other
day
as
soon
as
we
were
left
alone
i
asked
boon
if
she
had
confessed
anything
my
lady
she
replied
with
great
energy
in
this
world
will
make
me
confess
aught
against
chitt
at
the
instant
it
flashed
upon
me
that
this
woman
whoever
she
was
also
loved
him
and
i
looked
at
her
in
a
new
light
she
was
young
still
and
well
formed
with
small
hands
and
feet
that
told
of
gentle
nurture
cha
said
i
in
great
distress
are
you
pray
tell
me
it
is
of
no
use
to
conceal
anything
from
me
now
why
are
you
so
happy
to
suffer
with
me
any
one
else
would
have
left
me
to
die
alone
my
lady
she
began
folding
her
hands
together
as
well
as
she
could
with
the
chains
on
them
and
dragging
herself
close
to
me
me
o
forgive
me
i
am
chitt
wife
i
was
silent
in
amazement
at
length
i
said
on
and
tell
me
the
rest
boon
forgive
me
she
replied
humbly
cried
bitterly
the
night
he
returned
from
the
grand
fête
because
he
told
me
how
beautiful
you
were
how
passionately
he
loved
you
and
that
he
should
never
be
happy
again
until
he
obtained
you
for
his
wife
he
refused
to
eat
to
drink
or
to
sleep
and
i
vowed
to
him
by
my
love
that
you
should
be
his
but
i
found
you
were
the
favorite
and
that
it
would
be
a
more
difficult
task
than
i
had
at
first
thought
so
rather
than
break
my
promise
to
my
husband
nay
lady
rather
than
meet
his
cold
estranged
look
i
sold
myself
to
you
as
your
slave
every
ray
or
gleam
of
sunshine
every
beautiful
thought
that
fell
from
your
lips
i
treasured
up
in
my
heart
and
bore
them
daily
to
him
that
i
might
but
console
my
noble
husband
you
know
the
rest
if
i
deceived
you
it
was
to
serve
both
you
and
him
while
my
heart
wept
to
think
that
i
was
no
longer
beloved
gifted
with
unnumbered
virtues
is
my
husband
lady
and
my
heart
like
his
shadow
still
follows
him
everywhere
and
will
follow
him
forever
i
was
so
sorry
for
boon
i
had
not
the
heart
to
reproach
her
i
crept
closer
to
her
and
laying
my
head
on
her
bosom
we
mingled
our
tears
and
prayers
together
and
i
marvelled
at
the
greatness
of
the
woman
before
me
next
morning
for
morning
comes
even
to
such
wretches
as
my
companion
and
me
we
were
dragged
to
the
hall
of
justice
the
king
did
not
preside
as
we
had
expected
but
cruel
judges
male
and
female
headed
by
his
lordship
promè
and
her
ladyship
khoon
thow
app
not
knowing
what
charge
to
make
they
read
the
copy
of
my
letter
over
and
over
again
hoping
to
guess
the
name
of
the
gentleman
to
whom
it
was
sent
failing
to
do
this
they
subjected
boon
to
a
series
of
but
succeeded
only
in
eliciting
the
one
uniform
reply
can
a
poor
slave
know
my
lords
her
feet
were
then
bastinadoed
till
the
soles
were
raw
and
bleeding
she
still
said
lords
be
pitiful
what
can
a
poor
slave
know
after
a
little
while
khoon
thow
app
begged
boon
to
confess
all
and
save
herself
from
further
suffering
boon
remained
persistently
silent
and
the
lash
was
applied
to
her
bare
back
till
it
was
ribbed
in
long
gashes
but
she
confessed
not
a
word
at
last
the
torture
was
applied
to
her
thumbs
until
the
cold
sweat
stood
in
great
drops
on
her
contorted
and
agonized
brow
but
no
word
no
cry
for
mercy
no
sound
of
confession
escaped
her
lips
it
was
terrible
to
witness
the
power
of
endurance
that
sustained
this
woman
the
judges
and
executioners
both
male
and
female
exhausted
their
ingenuity
in
the
vain
attempt
to
make
her
betray
the
name
of
the
man
to
whom
she
had
carried
the
letter
and
finally
when
the
lengthening
shadows
proclaimed
the
close
of
day
they
departed
leaving
me
with
poor
boon
bleeding
and
almost
senseless
to
be
carried
back
by
the
attending
amazons
to
our
cell
i
tried
to
comfort
poor
boon
she
hardly
needed
comfort
her
joy
that
she
had
not
betrayed
her
husband
was
even
greater
than
her
sufferings
another
day
dawned
upon
us
boon
was
borne
in
a
litter
and
i
crept
trembling
by
her
side
to
the
same
hall
of
justice
boon
was
subjected
once
more
to
the
lash
the
bastinado
and
the
till
she
fell
all
but
lifeless
on
the
ground
it
was
all
in
vain
that
woman
possessed
the
heart
of
a
lion
if
they
had
torn
her
to
pieces
she
would
not
by
the
faintest
sound
have
betrayed
the
only
man
she
had
loved
in
her
sad
life
the
physicians
were
sent
for
to
restore
her
to
life
again
she
was
not
permitted
the
luxury
of
death
then
when
this
was
over
they
bound
up
her
wounds
with
old
rags
gave
her
something
to
revive
her
and
laid
her
on
a
cool
matting
my
turn
came
and
her
eyes
fixed
themselves
upon
me
with
an
intensity
that
fairly
made
me
shiver
they
seemed
to
cry
aloud
to
my
inmost
soul
saying
as
plainly
as
lips
could
speak
is
suffering
pain
or
death
compared
to
truth
be
true
to
yourself
be
true
to
your
love
if
you
love
another
you
love
not
yourself
flinch
not
bear
bravely
all
they
can
inflict
i
shuddered
as
the
judges
began
to
question
me
but
i
shuddered
more
whenever
i
met
eyes
so
fixed
so
steadfast
so
earnest
so
appealing
i
prevaricated
i
told
the
judges
lies
letter
was
written
as
a
joke
to
frighten
my
youngest
sister
i
was
only
playing
i
know
no
man
in
the
world
but
my
father
and
brothers
and
my
gracious
master
the
king
my
sister
was
summoned
if
i
could
have
spoken
with
her
she
might
have
helped
me
in
my
strait
but
the
women
who
were
sent
to
bring
her
questioned
her
before
she
knew
what
they
were
about
and
she
plainly
exposed
my
lies
to
the
judges
a
messenger
was
despatched
to
the
king
the
judges
feared
to
proceed
to
extreme
measures
with
me
who
had
so
lately
been
the
plaything
of
their
sovereign
after
half
an
hour
delay
the
instructions
were
received
and
i
was
ordered
to
bare
my
back
a
feeling
of
shame
prevented
me
i
would
not
obey
i
resisted
with
what
strength
i
had
may
lash
me
with
a
million
thongs
i
said
to
them
you
shall
not
expose
my
person
my
silk
vest
was
torn
off
my
scarf
was
flung
aside
my
slippers
were
taken
from
my
feet
my
arms
were
stretched
and
tied
to
a
post
and
thus
i
was
lashed
every
stroke
that
descended
on
my
back
maddened
me
into
an
obdurate
silence
boon
eyes
searched
into
my
soul
i
understood
their
meaning
my
flesh
was
laid
open
in
fine
thin
stripes
but
i
do
not
remember
flinching
my
feet
were
then
bastinadoed
and
i
still
preserved
i
know
not
how
my
secret
then
there
was
a
respite
and
they
gave
me
something
to
drink
in
fifteen
minutes
i
was
once
more
exhorted
to
confess
the
judges
finding
me
still
unsubdued
ordered
the
to
be
administered
not
all
the
agonies
not
all
the
horrors
i
have
ever
heard
of
can
compare
with
the
pain
of
that
torture
it
was
beyond
human
endurance
boon
forgive
me
forgive
me
i
cried
is
impossible
to
bear
it
with
boon
eyes
burning
into
my
soul
i
gasped
out
the
beloved
name
boon
threw
up
her
arms
gave
a
wild
shriek
of
terror
and
became
insensible
i
was
released
from
further
punishment
two
of
the
were
despatched
for
chitt
he
was
betrayed
to
the
officers
for
a
heavy
reward
and
before
noon
was
undergoing
the
same
process
of
the
law
when
boon
was
once
more
brought
to
life
she
saw
her
husband
in
the
hands
of
the
executioners
she
started
upright
and
supporting
herself
on
her
rigid
arms
and
hands
cried
out
to
the
judges
and
to
koon
thow
app
my
lords
o
my
lady
listen
to
me
o
believe
me
it
was
all
my
doing
i
am
chitt
wife
it
was
i
who
deceived
the
lady
choy
it
was
i
who
put
it
into
his
head
did
i
not
you
can
bear
testimony
to
my
guilt
an
ineffable
smile
beamed
on
her
pale
lips
and
in
her
dim
eyes
as
they
turned
towards
her
husband
there
was
profound
silence
among
the
judges
chitt
i
and
even
the
rabble
crowd
of
slaves
listened
to
her
with
astonished
countenances
there
was
an
incontestable
grandeur
about
the
woman
khoon
thow
app
that
stern
and
inflexible
woman
had
tears
in
her
eyes
and
her
voice
trembled
as
she
asked
was
thy
motive
o
boon
there
was
no
reply
from
boon
there
was
no
need
to
torture
chitt
he
was
chained
and
conveyed
to
the
criminals
prison
and
we
were
carried
back
to
our
cell
the
report
of
our
trial
and
the
confessions
elicited
were
sent
to
the
king
that
very
night
at
midnight
the
sentence
of
death
was
pronounced
by
the
secret
council
upon
us
three
but
the
most
dreadful
part
of
all
was
the
nature
of
the
sentence
boon
and
i
were
to
be
quartered
chitt
hewn
to
pieces
and
our
bodies
not
burned
but
cast
to
the
dogs
and
vultures
at
watt
sah
katè
my
sister
thieng
implored
the
king
in
vain
to
spare
my
life
my
poor
mother
and
father
were
prostrated
with
grief
as
for
boon
she
never
uttered
a
single
word
except
in
answer
to
my
inquiries
if
she
were
suffering
much
she
said
very
gently
cha
lah
pi
thort
let
me
say
farewell
dear
her
pallor
had
become
extreme
but
her
cheeks
still
burned
all
the
beauty
of
her
spirit
trembled
on
her
closed
eyelids
she
appeared
as
one
almost
divine
on
sunday
morning
at
four
the
faithful
and
matchless
boon
was
taken
from
our
cell
to
undergo
the
sentence
pronounced
upon
her
and
her
husband
the
day
appointed
for
my
execution
which
was
to
be
private
arrived
and
i
had
no
wish
to
live
now
that
chitt
and
boon
were
gone
but
the
women
who
attended
me
said
that
no
preparations
were
as
yet
made
for
it
i
wondered
why
i
was
permitted
to
live
so
long
after
two
weeks
of
cruel
waiting
to
join
my
beloved
boon
i
was
removed
to
another
cell
where
my
sister
visited
me
with
the
good
princess
somawati
her
daughter
at
whose
earnest
request
as
i
was
told
the
british
consul
had
pleaded
so
effectually
with
the
king
that
my
life
had
been
granted
to
his
petition
alas
it
was
boon
who
deserved
to
live
and
not
i
am
not
grateful
for
a
life
that
is
little
better
than
a
curse
to
me
god
sees
that
i
speak
the
truth
woe
still
hovers
over
me
it
is
the
doom
of
guilt
committed
in
some
former
lifetime
i
am
an
outcast
here
and
in
this
world
i
have
no
part
while
every
day
only
lengthens
out
my
life
of
sorrow
here
the
poor
girl
broke
off
laid
her
head
on
the
table
and
wept
as
i
never
saw
a
human
being
weep
great
tears
of
agony
and
remorse
as
soon
as
choy
left
me
i
hurried
home
and
wrote
down
her
narrative
word
for
word
as
nearly
as
i
could
but
i
encountered
then
as
always
the
almost
insuperable
difficulty
of
finding
a
fit
clothing

the
fervid
eastern
imagery

our
colder

the
cambodian
proselyte
we
became
better
friends
i
maintained
a
constant
oversight
of
her
and
persuaded
her
gradually
out
of
her
griefs
she
learned
in
time
to
take
pleasure
in
her
english
studies
and
found
comfort
in
the
love
of
our
father
in
heaven
without
repining
at
her
lot
hard
as
it
was
or
boasting
of
her
knowledge
but
with
a
loving
humble
heart
she
read
and
blessed
the
language
that
brought
her
nearer
to
a
compassionate
saviour

the

the
laotian
on
the
evening
of
the
of
august
i
found
myself
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
and
almost
without
being
aware
of
it
involved
in
a
conflict
with
the
king
who
thenceforth
regarded
me
with
distrust
and
suspicion
because
i
declined
to
affix
my
own
signature
to
a
certain
letter
which
he
had
required
me
to
write
for
him
i
began
heartily
to
wish
myself
out
of
siam
though
still
deeply
interested
and
absorbed
in
my
work
of
educating
the
prince
the
present
king
of
siam
for
i
felt
that
with
regard
to
foreigners
there
existed
no
laws
and
customs
to
restrain
and
limit
the
capricious
temper
and
extravagant
demands
of
the
king
and
i
had
everything
too
to
fear
from
the
jealousy
with
which
certain
royal
courtiers
and
judges
watched
my
previously
growing
influence
at
court
the
heat
of
the
day
had
been
intense
the
atmosphere
was
sultry
and
oppressive
and
every
now
and
then
a
low
rumbling
sound
of
distant
thunder
reached
my
ears
while
the
parched
trees
and
leaves
drooped
and
hung
their
heads
as
if
impatient
of
waiting
for
the
promised
rain
nervous
and
undecided
what
to
do
i
returned
home
where
i
remained
prostrated
with
a
sense
of
approaching
danger
from
time
to
time
i
had
had
similar
conflicts
with
the
king
which
very
greatly
disturbed
my
already
too
much
impaired
health
all
manner
of
fears
which
the
mind
so
prodigally
produces
on
such
occasions
came
crowding
upon
me
that
evening
and
i
felt
as
i
had
never
before
weighed
down
by
the
peculiar
sadness
and
isolation
of
my
life
in
siam
in
this
frame
of
mind
i
sat
and
pondered
over
and
over
again
the
only
course
remaining
open
to
me
to
withdraw
from
the
court
when
i
was
suddenly
recalled
to
what
was
passing
around
me
by
what
i
at
first
imagined
must
be
an
apparition
or
some
delusion
of
my
own
mind
i
started
up
from
the
spot
where
for
hours
i
had
been
seated
like
a
statue
and
looking
more
attentively
perceived
a
pair
of
bright
black
eyes
watching
me
with
the
fixedness
of
a
basilisk
through
the
leaves
of
some
flowering
shrubs
that
grew
over
my
window
my
first
impulse
was
to
scream
for
help
but
i
was
soon
ashamed
of
my
fears
and
summoning
all
my
courage
i
demanded
who
is
there
it
is
only
me
your
ladyship
said
a
strange
low
voice
i
have
been
waiting
here
a
long
while
but
your
servants
would
not
let
me
in
they
say
you
have
forbidden
them
to
let
any
siamese
person
enter
your
house
after
sunset
it
is
true
said
i
i
do
want
to
see
any
one
this
evening
i
am
ill
and
tired
now
go
away
and
if
you
have
any
business
with
me
come
to
me
in
the
morning
thô
said
the
woman
speaking
still
in
the
same
low
tones
i
am
not
a
siamese
and
you
do
not
know
that
i
have
rowed
thirty
miles
against
the
tide
to
come
and
see
you
or
else
you
could
not
have
the
heart
to
send
me
away
i
do
want
to
know
anything
i
said
a
little
impatiently
you
must
go
now
and
you
know
it
is
not
safe
for
you
to
be
away
from
home
at
this
late
hour
in
the
day
o
lady
do
let
me
in
i
only
want
to
say
one
word
to
you
in
private
please
do
let
me
in
whispered
the
woman
more
and
more
pleadingly
then
say
what
you
have
to
tell
me
at
once
and
from
where
you
are
i
replied
there
is
no
one
here
to
overhear
you
for
i
can
not
let
you
in
alas
said
the
voice
plaintively
as
if
speaking
to
herself
i
would
not
have
come
all
this
long
distance
but
that
i
heard
she
was
a
good
and
brave
woman
some
people
indeed
said
she
was
not
so
still
i
thought
i
would
try
her
and
now
she
says
she
can
not
let
me
in
a
poor
fugitive
and
desolate
like
me
o
dear
o
dear
but
i
am
afraid
i
can
not
help
you
whatever
your
trouble
may
be
i
said
more
gently
touched
by
the
woman
despairing
tones
the
king
is
offended
with
me
and
the
judges
know
it
and
i
have
no
more
influence
with
them
now
as
i
said
this
the
girl
sprang
through
the
window
and
came
forward
and
exhibited
not
only
her
bright
eyes
but
her
full
figure
and
somewhat
singular
dress
for
she
was
as
she
had
stated
not
a
siamese
but
a
laotian
she
held
her
head
erect
though
her
hands
were
clasped
in
the
attitude
of
wild
supplication
the
symmetry
of
her
form
was
enhanced
by
a
broad
english
strap
or
belt
which
was
buckled
round
her
waist
and
which
had
the
effect
of
showing
off
her
beautiful
figure
to
the
best
advantage
she
was
unusually
tall
and
altogether
a
most
young
woman
the
moment
she
stood
before
me
she
commenced
talking
with
a
volubility
and
an
amount
of
action
which
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
describe
her
face
became
so
animated
and
her
tears
and
sobs
flowed
so
spontaneously
that
i
stood
bewildered
for
in
truth
i
had
rarely
seen
so
interesting
and
so
natural
a
woman
in
siam
she
watched
my
countenance
during
the
whole
time
she
was
speaking
with
the
quickness
of
the
native
character
and
i
began
at
length
to
suspect
that
she
prolonged
her
statements
for
the
sole
purpose
of
forming
an
idea
of
her
success
so
that
she
might
vary
her
line
of
action
according
as
circumstances
revealed
themselves
and
even
while
i
had
a
glimmering
perception
of
this
and
also
that
perhaps
she
was
only
acting
my
interest
in
her
increased
so
rapidly
that
she
became
convinced
in
her
own
mind
i
think
of
having
gained
my
entire
sympathy
ah
i
knew
you
had
a
kind
heart
said
the
woman
as
she
came
forward
with
the
graceful
salutation
of
her
country
and
laid
a
thick
oriental
letter
enveloped
in
velvet
and
fastened
with
silken
cords
and
sealed
with
english
at
my
feet
she
then
dropped
on
her
knees
and
knelt
before
me
in
an
attitude
of
mute
supplication
i
was
never
more
embarrassed
in
my
life
with
that
mysterious
letter
enveloped
in
crimson
velvet
and
written
on
the
outside
in
characters
i
had
never
before
seen
lying
at
my
feet
and
this
woman
kneeling
there
with
such
strange
wild
energy
in
her
manner
such
vehement
pleading
in
her
dark
passionate
eyes
imploring
my
aid
in
a
secret
daring
scheme
which
i
had
neither
the
courage
nor
the
ability
to
undertake
nor
yet
the
stoutness
of
heart
to
refuse
i
therefore
told
the
woman
with
as
much
gentleness
as
i
could
summon
that
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
aid
her
and
almost
as
much
as
my
life
was
worth
to
become
the
bearer
of
her
letter
to
any
prisoner
in
the
palace
it
is
not
for
my
own
personal
safety
i
fear
so
much
but
for
my
son
whose
young
life
depends
on
mine
as
i
was
speaking
the
woman
face
grew
still
and
cold
her
features
became
rigid
and
fixed
as
stone
large
dewy
drops
of
perspiration
broke
out
on
her
forehead
and
there
fell
upon
her
face
such
an
expression
of
blankness
and
utter
desolation
that
i
thought
she
was
absolutely
dying
from
the
pain
of
her
disappointment
this
produced
such
a
revulsion
of
feeling
in
me
that
i
started
from
my
seat
in
terror
and
taking
her
chilled
moist
hands
in
mine
said
anxiously
does
what
i
have
said
distress
you
so
much
why
wo
you
speak
if
there
is
any
way
by
which
i
can
help
or
comfort
you
tell
me
please
tell
me
and
i
try
to
do
my
best
for
you
the
effect
of
this
promise
was
immediate
but
it
was
some
time
before
the
woman
could
recover
her
voice
then
laying
her
hand
upon
my
arm
she
spoke
hurriedly
but
in
the
same
soft
low
tones
and
fervent
manner
you
have
not
asked
me
my
name
and
who
i
am
she
said
but
i
tell
you
i
am
sure
you
will
not
betray
me
and
it
may
be
this
is
the
last
opportunity
i
shall
have
of
serving
my
dear
as
she
uttered
these
words
the
hope
and
courage
which
had
evidently
been
revived
by
the
sympathy
she
saw
in
my
face
now
seemed
to
forsake
her
tears
and
sobs
burst
from
her
afresh
and
she
crouched
at
my
feet
as
if
utterly
overwhelmed
with
her
grief
at
last
by
a
strong
effort
she
turned
to
me
and
said
my
name
is
my
home
is
in
the
city
of
zienmai
chiengmai
my
father
manetho
is
one
of
the
most
trusted
councillors
and
friends
though
a
slave
of
the
prince
chow
soorwang
my
mother
was
a
household
slave
in
the
family
of
the
prince
when
my
father
obtained
her
for
his
wife
and
i
was
only
a
month
old
when
she
was
asked
to
be
the
and
mother
of
the
little
infant
daughter
of
the
prince
whose
wife
had
died
in
and
thus
it
was
that
i
became
the
companion
and
friend
and
of
the
young
princess
sunartha
vismita
but
alas
dear
lady
she
is
now
and
has
been
ever
since
the
death
of
her
husband
the
second
king
a
prisoner
in
the
palace
of
the
supreme
king
and
neither
does
her
brother
nor
any
one
else
know
whether
she
is
alive
or
dead
this
letter
has
nothing
in
it
that
will
bring
you
into
any
trouble
it
is
only
one
of
greeting
from
her
brother
my
master
the
prince
karmatha
o
dear
lady
do
say
no
the
gods
will
bless
and
reward
you
if
sooner
or
later
you
will
put
it
into
her
hands
but
it
must
be
done
with
the
greatest
caution
and
secrecy
and
it
may
be
the
means
of
saving
her
life
o
think
of
that
of
saving
her
life
for
if
alive
she
must
be
dying
of
grief
and
pain
to
think
that
we
have
never
yet
replied
to
a
letter
she
sent
us
almost
a
year
ago
and
where
is
the
prince
your
master
he
is
on
a
visit
to
the
governor
of
saying
this
she
almost
instantaneously
sprang
out
of
the
window
and
fled
towards
the
river
as
if
conscious
of
having
delayed
too
long
her
return
home
as
she
did
so
i
noticed
that
she
wore
in
the
folds
of
her
skirt
a
small
laotian
dagger
attached
to
her
english
belt
the
storm
which
had
been
gathering
in
strength
for
hours
now
burst
forth
and
for
full
three
hours
the
thunder
and
lightning
and
rain
were
the
only
things
that
could
be
seen
or
heard
and
i
sat
in
the
same
spot
lost
in
anxious
fears
for
the
safety
of
that
solitary
woman
battling
with
the
tremendous
currents
of
the
mother
of
waters
it
was
an
awful
night
sick
at
heart
and
full
of
natural
and
unnatural
fears
i
locked
up
the
letter
at
last
in
my
drawer
and
tried
to
forget
in
sleep
the
disturbing
events
of
the
day
chapter
xvii
an
accidental
discovery
of
the
whereabouts
of
the
princess
sunartha
vismita
for
some
time
afterwards
the
mysterious
letter
remained
locked
up
in
my
drawer
as
nobody
whom
i
knew
seemed
to
be
aware
even
of
the
existence
of
such
a
person
as
the
princess
sunartha
vismita
much
less
of
her
imprisonment
in
the
palace
and
i
was
afraid
to
open
my
lips
on
the
subject
before
a
stranger
lest
i
should
inadvertently
say
something
that
might
still
more
imperil
her
health
and
safety
the
king
was
once
more
reconciled
to
me
and
had
taken
me
into
greater
confidence
than
ever
just
at
this
time
he
was
laid
up
with
an
illness
which
confined
him
to
his
topmost
chamber
where
i
was
summoned
every
day
to
write
notes
or
translate
with
the
help
of
the
native
female
secretary
english
documents
into
siamese
on
one
occasion
as
i
was
at
work
in
a
room
adjoining
the
royal
bedchamber
over
a
mass
of
perplexing
manuscripts
in
the
king
own
handwriting
to
be
arranged
for
publication
in
the
bangkok
recorder
the
chief
of
the
amazons
brought
in
the
intelligence
that
the
prisoner
princess
sunartha
vismita
was
very
ill
and
his
majesty
being
in
the
best
possible
humor
having
just
finished
the
manuscript
which
completely
refuted
as
he
fondly
believed
bradley
theory
of
original
depravity
gave
orders
that
the
princess
should
take
an
airing
in
the
palace
gardens
and
be
removed
to
another
cell
and
that
the
chief
lady
physician
should
attend
her
without
delay
the
amazon
made
haste
to
carry
out
her
instructions
and
i
quietly
left
my
desk
to
follow
her
i
shall
not
attempt
to
enter
into
a
particular
description
of
the
prison
in
the
interior
of
this
strange
city
indeed
it
would
be
impossible
to
describe
with
any
degree
of
accuracy
so
irregular
and
rambling
an
edifice
the
principal
features
consisted
of
a
great
hall
and
two
courts
or
enclosures
one
behind
the
other
in
which
the
prisoners
were
permitted
to
walk
at
stated
times
three
vaulted
dungeons
occupied
three
sides
of
the
enclosures
immediately
below
these
were
the
cells
already
described
in
my
former
book
the
upper
cells
were
used
more
or
less
for
the
reception
of
women
convicted
of
petty
crimes
such
as
gambling
stealing
immodest
language
etc
besides
these
there
were
other
dungeons
under
the
floor
in
various
parts
of
the
prison
some
of
them
quite
dark
and
closed
by
huge
designed
for
those
whom
it
might
be
expedient
to
treat
with
peculiar
severity
the
prison
was
approached
by
two
long
corridors
opening
into
the
courts
here
were
several
small
secret
apartments
or
cells
in
which
prisoners
condemned
to
death
either
by
the
supreme
court
or
by
the
still
more
supreme
will
of
the
king
passed
the
last
days
of
their
existence
it
was
in
one
of
these
that
the
princess
was
confined
the
opening
of
the
prison
doors
attracted
as
usual
a
crowd
of
idle
slave
women
and
girls
who
hailed
the
slightest
event
that
broke
the
monotony
of
their
lives
with
demonstrations
of
the
liveliest
joy
and
as
i
stood
there
a
guard
of
amazons
appeared
marching
in
file
and
in
the
centre
was
the
laotian
princess
followed
by
two
of
her
countrywomen
she
did
not
seem
to
notice
the
general
sensation
which
her
appearance
created
nor
the
eager
curiosity
with
which
she
was
regarded
but
walked
on
wearing
the
depressed
and
wearied
look
of
one
who
sought
to
meditate
on
her
sorrows
in
silence
and
privacy
her
features
were
remarkably
stern
however
and
she
moved
along
with
a
firm
and
steady
step
i
followed
with
the
crowd
who
kept
at
a
respectful
distance
when
the
procession
arrived
at
one
of
the
nearest
gardens
laid
out
in
the
chinese
style
the
princess
with
a
proud
intimation
that
she
could
go
no
farther
took
her
seat
on
the
edge
of
an
artificial
rock
beside
a
small
pond
of
water
in
which
gold
and
silver
fish
sported
merrily
together
she
hung
down
her
head
as
if
the
fresh
air
had
no
power
to
remove
the
smallest
portion
of
her
sorrows
and
sufferings
a
deep
murmur
of
compassion
now
rose
not
only
from
the
idle
crowd
of
women
and
girls
who
gazed
into
her
face
but
from
the
amazonian
guard
those
automatons
of
the
royal
palace
of
siam
i
could
see
that
she
just
raised
her
dark
sad
eyes
to
us
and
then
cast
them
down
again
and
that
their
expression
as
well
as
that
of
her
whole
attitude
was
one
of
mute
and
touching
appeal
against
this
most
ungenerous
usage
after
the
lapse
of
an
hour
the
procession
resumed
its
course
and
the
crowd
who
had
by
this
time
exchanged
looks
and
whispers
of
sympathy
to
their
hearts
content
while
some
poor
and
aged
had
lifted
up
their
hands
and
prayed
aloud
for
the
happiness
of
the
princess
brought
up
the
rear
till
they
saw
the
same
prison
doors
open
and
close
once
more
on
the
noble
lady
and
her
attendants
when
they
dispersed
to
their
various
abodes
when
i
returned
home
the
scene
would
constantly
reproduce
itself
and
my
thoughts
would
unceasingly
revert
to
those
sad
eyes
of
which
i
had
only
caught
a
hasty
glance
and
that
utter
friendlessness
expressed
in
a
few
brief
slight
actions
dwelt
in
my
memory
like
the
impressions
of
childhood
never
to
be
wholly
forgotten
i
could
not
help
picturing
to
myself
how
those
eyes
would
brighten
if
i
could
but
put
that
letter
into
her
hands
and
tell
her
of
one
earnest
friend
at
least
whose
love
and
sympathy
knew
no
bounds
this
feeling
at
length
urged
me
now
that
with
the
restored
favor
of
the
king
there
could
be
no
real
danger
to
myself
and
my
boy
to
find
some
means
of
gaining
access
to
the
poor
sad
prisoner
i
immediately
put
the
letter
into
my
pocket
and
pinned
it
carefully
there
and
determined
that
after
my
school
duties
were
over
i
would
advise
with
my
good
friend
lady
thieng
of
whom
mention
has
already
been
made
only
one
circumstance
troubled
my
mind
greatly
and
it
was
how
to
broach
the
subject
to
her
in
the
presence
of
the
number
of
women
who
always
attended
her
at
all
times
and
in
all
places

lady
thieng
the
head
wife
and
superintendent
of
the
royal
cuisine
lady
thieng
was
a
woman
of
about
thirty
fair
even
to
whiteness
with
jet
black
hair
and
eyes
by
nature
enthusiastic
clever
and
kind
but
only
partially
educated
when
compared
to
many
other
of
the
cultivated
and
intellectual
women
of
the
royal
harem
she
was
the
first
mother
having
brought
his
majesty
four
sons
and
eight
daughters
for
which
reason
she
was
regarded
with
peculiar
veneration
and
ranked
as
the
head
wife
in
the
palace
the
queen
consort
being
dead
all
these
considerations
combined
entitled
her
to
the
lucrative
and
responsible
position
of
superintendent
of
the
royal
cuisine
she
contrived
to
be
always
in
favor
with
the
king
simply
because
she
was
the
only
woman
among
all
that
vast
throng
who
really
loved
him
though
at
no
period
of
her
life
had
she
ever
enjoyed
the
unenviable
distinction
of
being
the
favorite
her
natural
enthusiasm
and
kindliness
of
disposition
made
her
generally
loved
however
while
despite
her
immense
wealth
and
influence
no
woman
life
had
a
truer
and
deeper
purpose
she
was
always
ready
to
sympathize
with
and
help
her
suffering
sisters
whatever
their
shortcomings
might
have
been
or
whatever
the
means
she
was
obliged
to
resort
to
in
order
to
render
them
the
smallest
assistance
she
reconciled
all
her
little
plots
intrigues
and
deceptions
to
herself
by
saying
surely
it
is
better
for
him
not
to
know
everything
he
knows
too
much
already
what
with
his
siamese
and
his
english
and
his
pali
and
his
sanscrit
i
wonder
he
can
ever
get
to
sleep
at
all
with
so
many
different
tongues
in
his
head
it
was
after
school
that
i
accompanied
one
of
my
most
promising
pupils
the
princess
somawati
one
of
thieng
daughters
to
her
mother
house
being
the
head
of
the
royal

thieng
had
two
houses
one
was
her
home
where
her
children
were
born
and
brought
up
a
quaint
stately
edifice
with
stuccoed
fronts
situated
in
the
ladies
or
fashionable
part
of
the
inner
city
and
in
the
midst
of
a
pleasant
garden
in
the
other
adjoining
the
royal
kitchen
she
spent
the
greater
part
of
each
day
in
selecting
overlooking
and
sometimes
preparing
with
her
own
fair
hands
many
of
the
costly
dainties
that
were
destined
to
grace
the
royal
table
thieng
received
me
with
her
usual
bright
pleasant
smile
and
hearty
embrace
to
give
me
the
latter
she
put
down
her
youngest
baby
a
boy
about
two
years
old
to
whom
i
had
during
my
repeated
visits
to
her
house
taught
a
number
of
little

his
mother

handmaids
little
chai
settled
himself
in
my

as

and
the
host
of
women
like
children
eager
to
be
amused
gathered
around
to
listen
to
our
and
great
was
the
general
uproar
when
chai
would
mimic
me
in
singing
scraps
of
or
thrust
an
orange
into
my
mouth
or
put
on
my
hat
and
cloak
to
promenade
the
chamber
and
say
how
do
do
like
a
veritable
englishman
then
his
fond
mother
in
ecstasies
of
joy
would
snatch
him
to
her
arms
and
cover
him
with
kisses
and
the
delighted
spectators
would
whisper
that
that
boy
was
as
clever
as
his
father
and
must
surely
come
to
the
throne
some
day
or
other
in
the
midst
of
these
fascinating
employments
one
of
the
was
announced
thieng
retired
at
once
with
her
into
an
inner
chamber
carrying
her
beloved
chai
in
her
arms
and
beckoning
me
to
follow
her
here
she
consigned
chai
to
me
for
further
instruction
in
english
and
laid
herself
down
to
be
shampooed
i
felt
that
now
was
my
opportunity
but
i
waited
a
little
in
order
to
make
sure
whether
the
doctor
was
to
be
trusted
the
ladies
were
silent
for
a
little
while
no
word
was
spoken
with
the
exception
of
a
sigh
that
now
and
then
escaped
from
poor
thieng
partly
to
indicate
the
responsibilities
of
her
position
and
partly
to
show
that
the
particular
member
which
was
being
manipulated
was
the
one
most
affected
whatever
might
have
been
the
question
between
the
ladies
the
doctor
waited
for
thieng
to
give
the
word
and
thieng
evidently
waited
for
the
termination
of
my
visit
but
seeing
that
i
made
no
attempt
to
go
she
at
length
turned
to
the
doctor
and
said
my
pen
arai
phöt
thöe
yai
kluâ
never
mind
speak
out
do
be
afraid
all
of
which
i
understood
as
perfectly
as
i
did
english
the
doctor
ceased
her
manipulations
and
after
having
cast
a
cautious
glance
round
the
room
and
shaken
her
head
sorrowfully
remarked
i
do
think
she
live
many
weeks
longer
thieng
sat
bolt
upright
and
clasping
her
hands
together
said
phoodth
thô
it
is
impossible
added
the
doctor
very
earnestly
it
were
better
to
put
her
to
death
at
once
than
to
kill
her
by
inches
as
they
are
now
doing
buddh
the
chow
help
us
cried
thieng
still
more
agitated
what
shall
i
do
what
can
i
do
to
save
her
something
must
be
done
and
at
once
replied
the
doctor
suggestively
well
said
thieng
why
do
you
draw
up
a
paper
and
give
it
to
mai
ying
thaphan
the
chief
of
the
amazons
and
now
mind
that
you
say
she
can
not
live
a
day
longer
unless
she
is
removed
from
that
close
cell
and
allowed
to
take
an
airing
every
day
poor
child
poor
child
repeated
thieng
tenderly
to
herself
with
such
a
noble
heart
to
perish
in
such
a
way
i
wish
i
could
find
some
means
to
help
her
to
live
a
little
longer
till
things
begin
to
look
more
bright
he
has
forgotten
all
about
her
by
this
time
rejoined
the
doctor
the
physician
then
took
her
leave
of
thieng
and
i
inquired
if
they
had
been
speaking
of
the
princess
sunartha
vismita
the
good
lady
started
and
looked
at
me
as
if
she
supposed
me
to
be
supernaturally
endowed
with
the
art
of
unravelling
mysteries
why
how
do
you
know
the
name
said
she
when
we
never
even
mentioned
it
i
then
told
her
of
the
visit
i
had
had
from
and
begged
of
her
to
help
me
to
deliver
the
letter
to
the
dying
princess
as
soon
as
possible
we
are
all
prisoners
here
dear
friend
said
thieng
and
we
have
to
be
very
careful
what
we
do
but
if
you
promise
never
to
say
a
word
on
this
subject
to
any
one
and
in
case
of
discovery
to
bear
all
the
blame
whatever
that
may
be
yourself
i
help
you
i
gave
her
the
required
promise
gladly
and
thanked
her
warmly
at
the
same
time
you
must
not
think
me
weak
and
selfish
dear
mam
said
she
after
a
little
reflection
you
are
a
foreigner
he
has
not
the
same
power
over
you
and
you
can
go
away
whenever
you
like
but
we
who
are
his
subjects
must
stay
here
and
suffer
his
will
and
pleasure
whatever
happens
with
that
she
told
me
to
come
to
her
after
sunset
and
i
bade
her
a
grateful
adieu
and
returned
home

the
princess
sunartha
vismita
an
hour
after
dark
i
again
sought
the
good
and
thieng
who
not
only
hurried
me
off
telling
me
in
a
voice
of
great
exultation
that
the
physician
report
had
in
a
great
measure
ameliorated
the
rigorous
confinement
to
which
the
royal
prisoner
had
hitherto
been
subjected
but
bravely
sent
two
of
her
women
to
tell
the
amazons
to
show
me
the
apartment
to
which
the
sick
princess
had
been
removed
the
small
apartment
into
which
i
was
ushered
was
dimly
lighted
by
a
wick
burning
in
an
earthen
vessel
the
only
window
was
thrown
wide
open
immediately
beneath
it
on
a
pair
of
wooden
trucks
which
supported
a
narrow
plank
covered
with
a
flowered
mat
and
satin
pillow
lay
the
wasted
form
of
the
princess
sunartha
vismita
her
dress
was
that
of
a
laotian
lady
of
high
rank
it
consisted
of
a
scarlet
silk
skirt
falling
in
firm
folds
to
her
feet
a
black
flowered
silk
vest
and
a
long
veil
or
scarf
of
indian
gauze
thrown
across
her
shoulders
some
rings
of
great
value
and
beauty
and
a
heavy
gold
chain
were
her
only
ornaments
her
hair
was
combed
smoothly
back
bound
in
a
massive
knot
behind
and
confined
by
a
perfect
tiara
of
pins
she
was
not
beautiful
but
when
you
looked
at
her
you
never
thought
of
her
features
for
the
defiant
and
heroic
pride
that
flashed
from
her
large
dark
melancholy
eyes
fixed
your
attention
it
was
a
face
never
to
be
forgotten
at
her
feet
were
two
other
on
these
were
seated
the
two
young
laotian
women
who
shared
her
captivity
and
who
looked
very
wan
and
sad
illustration
ladies
of
the
royal
harem
at
dinner
advancing
unannounced
close
to
this
mournful
group
i
sat
down
near
them
while
the
dark
depressing
influence
of
the
place
stole
upon
my
spirits
and
filled
me
with
the
same
dismal
gloom
the
princess
who
had
been
gazing
at
the
little
bit
of
sky
of
which
she
could
only
get
a
glimpse
through
the
iron
bars
of
the
open
window
turned
upon
me
the
same
quiet
look
manifesting
neither
surprise
nor
displeasure
at
seeing
me
enter
her
apartment
it
was
a
look
that
spoke
of
utter
hopelessness
of
ever
being
extricated
from
that
forlorn
place
and
a
quiet
conviction
that
she
was
very
ill
perhaps
dying
yet
without
a
trace
of
fear
or
anxiety
the
air
was
heavy
and
difficult
to
breathe
and
for
a
moment
or
two
i
was
silent
confounded
by
the
unexpected
bravery
and
fortitude
evinced
by
the
prisoner
but
quickly
recovering
my
i
inquired
about
her
health
i
am
well
said
the
lady
with
a
proud
and
indifferent
manner
pray
why
have
you
come
here
with
a
sense
of
infinite
relief
i
told
her
that
my
visit
was
a
private
one
to
herself
is
that
the
truth
she
inquired
looking
rather
at
her
women
for
some
confirmation
than
at
me
for
a
reply
it
is
indeed
i
answered
unhesitatingly
i
have
come
to
you
as
one
woman
would
come
to
another
who
is
in
trouble
but
how
may
that
be
she
rejoined
haughtily
you
must
know
madam
that
all
women
are
not
alike
some
are
born
princesses
and
some
are
born
slaves
she
pronounced
these
words
very
slowly
and
in
the
court
language
of
the
siamese
yes
we
are
not
all
alike
dear
lady
i
replied
gently
i
have
not
come
here
out
of
mere
idle
curiosity
but
because
i
could
not
refuse
your
request
to
do
you
a
service
what
did
you
say
cried
the
lady
joyfully
rising
and
drawing
me
towards
her
putting
her
arms
ever
so
lovingly
round
my
neck
and
laying
her
burning
cheek
against
mine
did
you
say
without
another
word
for
i
could
not
speak
i
was
so
much
moved
i
drew
out
of
my
pocket
the
mysterious
letter
and
put
it
into
her
hands
i
wish
i
could
see
again
such
a
look
of
surprise
and
joy
as
that
which
illuminated
her
proud
face
so
rapid
was
the
change
from
despair
to
gladness
that
she
seemed
for
the
moment
supremely
beautiful
her
bps
trembled
and
tears
filled
her
eyes
as
with
a
nervous
movement
she
tore
open
the
velvet
covering
and
leaned
towards
the
earthen
lamp
to
read
her
precious
letter
i
could
not
doubt
that
she
had
a
tender
heart
for
there
was
a
beautiful
flush
on
her
wan
face
which
was
every
now
and
then
faintly
perceptible
in
the
flickering
a
smile
half
of
triumph
and
half
of
sadness
curved
her
fine
lip
as
she
finished
the
letter
and
turned
to
communicate
its
contents
to
her
eager
companions
in
a
language
unknown
to
me
after
this
the
three
women
talked
together
long
and
anxiously
the
two
attendants
urging
their
mistress
to
do
something
to
which
apparently
she
would
not
consent
for
at
last
she
threw
the
letter
away
angrily
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
as
if
unable
to
resist
their
arguments
the
elder
of
the
women
quietly
took
up
the
letter
and
read
it
several
times
aloud
to
her
companion
she
then
opened
a
and
drew
out
of
it
an
inkhorn
a
small
reed
and
long
roll
of
yellow
paper
on
which
she
began
a
lengthy
and
labored
epistle
now
and
then
rubbing
out
the
words
she
had
written
with
her
finger
and
commencing
afresh
with
renewed
vigor
when
the
letter
was
finished
i
never
in
my
life
saw
a
more
unsightly
blotted
affair
than
it
was
and
i
fell
to
wondering
if
any
mortal
on
earth
would
have
skill
and
ingenuity
enough
to
decipher
its
meaning
but
she
folded
it
carefully
and
put
it
into
a
lovely
blue
silk
cover
which
she
took
from
that
box
which
might
have
been
aladdin
wonderful
lamp
turned
inside
out
for
aught
i
knew
to
the
contrary
and
stitching
up
the
bag
or
cover
she
sewed
on
the
outside
a
bit
of
paper
addressed
in
the
same
mysterious
and
unknown
letters
which
bore
a
strong
resemblance
to
the
birmese
characters
turned
upside
down
and
were
altogether
as
weird
and
hieroglyphic
as
the
ancient
characters
found
in
the
pahlavi
and
deri
manuscript
when
all
her
labors
were
completed
she
handed
it
to
me
with
a
hopeful
smile
on
her
face
meanwhile
the
princess
who
seemed
to
have
been
plunged
in
a
very
profound
and
serious
meditation
turned
and
addressed
me
with
an
air
of
mystery
and
doubt
did
promise
you
any
money
on
being
answered
in
the
negative
do
you
want
any
money
she
again
inquired
no
thank
you
i
replied
only
tell
me
to
whom
i
am
to
carry
this
letter
for
i
can
not
read
the
address
and
i
endeavor
to
serve
you
to
the
best
of
my
ability
when
i
had
done
speaking
she
seemed
surprised
and
pleased
for
she
again
put
her
arms
round
about
my
neck
and
embraced
me
twice
or
thrice
in
the
most
affectionate
manner
entreating
me
to
believe
that
she
would
always
be
my
grateful
friend
and
that
she
would
always
bless
me
in
her
thoughts
and
enjoining
me
to
deliver
the
letter
into
no
other
hands
but
those
of
or
her
brother
the
prince
karmatha
who
was
concealed
for
the
present
as
she
said
in
the
house
of
the
governor
of
pak
lat
i
returned
her
warm
embraces
and
went
home
somewhat
happier
but
i
seemed
to
hear
throughout
the
rest
of
the
night
the
creaking
of
the
huge
prison
door
which
had
turned
so
reluctantly
on
its
rusty
hinges

pak

properly
pak

is
situated
a
few
miles
above

and
is
in
itself
a
picturesque
village
containing
from
six
to
seven
thousand
inhabitants
the
most
important
portion
of
the
town
faces
a

bend
of

is
rather
irregularly
built
and
surrounded
by
a
great
many
rude
houses
and
shops
some
of
them
quite
old
and
others
quite
new
a
magnificent
new
buddhist
temple
is
seen
gradually
raising
its
head
close
by
the
side
of
an
ancient
one
which
has
so
far
crumbled
to
decay
that
the
bright
sun
pours
down
unchecked
a
flood
of
golden
light
on
the
tapering
crown
of
a
huge
brass
image
of
the
buddha
which
sits
with
its
hands
folded
in
undisturbed
and
profound
contemplation
on
its
glittering
altar
on

other
side
as
far
as
the
eye
can
reach

unlimited
groves
of
bananas
and
extensive
plantations
of
cocoanut
and
palms
the
mango
tamarind
banyan
and
boh
or
bogara
trees
here
are
of
wonderful
size
and
beauty
ponderous
and
overshadowing
as
if
they
had
weathered
a
thousand
summers
and
winters
and
would
live
unimpaired
through
a
thousand
more
and
as
you
wander
through
the
deep
cool
shade
which
they
afford
you
find
that
many
of
them
must
have
served
hundreds
of
years
ago
before
buddhism
was
introduced
into
siam
and
at
a
period
when
both
the
tree
and
serpent
worship
prevailed
here
as
in
other
parts
of
the
old
world
as
altars
to
a
generation
long
gone
by
many
of
their
huge
old
trunks
have
been
hollowed
out
and
carved
in
the
form
of
oriel
chapels
or
windows
in
the
inmost
recesses
of
which
may
still
be
traced
the
faint
remains
of
what
was
intended
to
represent
the
or
hooded
snake
of
india
now
covered
over
with
tender
leaves
and
brilliant
flowers
and
forming
at
once
the
cosiest
and
most
delicious
of
couches
for
the
weary
traveller
to
rest
upon
pak
laut
with
all
its
ancient
splendor
and
attractiveness
had
one
drawback
and
that
was
a
very
serious
one
among
the
village
edifices
was
an
open
sala
or
hall
which
had
long
been
the
favorite
place
of
rendezvous
for
all
the
rough
and
riotous
seamen
english
and
american
the
crews
of
the
merchant
vessels
trading
to
bangkok
and
it
was
in
consequence
set
down
in
the
code
of
etiquette
observed
by
the
dozen
or
so
of
the
of
the
english
and
american
foreigners
who
resided
at
bangkok
as
a
dreadfully
improper
place
for
a
lady
to
visit
alone
thus
it
was
quite
out
of
the
question
that
i
should
go
there
without
an
escort
and
not
be
tabooed
by
those
good
people
as
one
utterly
outside
of
the
pale
of
their
society
luckily
at
this
time
monsieur
m
an
to
the
french
consulate
had
been
sent
by
campbell
to
pak
laut
for
change
of
air
and
monsieur
l
the
commander
of
the
king
guard
and
his
wife
were
going
to
see
him
being
acquainted
with
the
invalid
i
obtained
their
permission
to
make
one
of
the
party
notwithstanding
the
perplexity
of
friends
who
could
not
imagine
my
motive
for
going
there
and
who
made
themselves
quite
merry
at
my
expense
i
found
myself
in
a
boat
with
the
blue
letter
pinned
in
my
pocket
my
boy
at
my
side
and
monsieur
and
madame
l
opposite
me
at
five
one
morning
sailing
down
with
the
tide
to
pak
laut
when
i
arrived
there
i
made
a
hasty
breakfast
with
the
sick
man
and
his
friends
and
leaving
my
boy
at
play
in
charge
of
the
lady
i
hurried
off
in
the
direction
of
the
governor
palace
keean
the
governor
was
a
peguan
prince
by
birth
and
the
father
of
my
dear
friend
whose
name
translated
into
english
is
hidden
perfume
he
received
me
so
kindly
and
looked
so
benevolent
that
i
felt
encouraged
to
tell
him
the
object
of
my
visit
at
once
taking
my
hand
in
his
and
keeping
the
smile
of
appreciation
on
his
honest
face
he
led
me
through
several
long
halls
and
corridors
which
brought
us
at
length
to
a
very
old
tower
covered
with
moss
and
black
with
age
with
narrow
loopholes
for
windows
and
surrounded
by
a
deep
moat
or
ditch
full
of
stagnant
water
from
the
roof
of
this
extraordinary
building
descended
two
flights
of
steps
built
in
the
wall
and
leading
directly
to
two
ruinous
old
drawbridges
that
spanned
the
moat
the
one
communicated
with
the
governor
palace
while
the
other
led
to
a
low
arched
gateway
which
opened
immediately
on
a
canal
and
thus
had
access
to
the
river
what
the
moat
was
intended
for
i
could
in
no
wise
imagine
unless
it
were
especially
designed
to
connect
the
tower
independent
of
the
bridges
with
the
river
and
thus
in
cases
of
necessity
afford
the
inmates
an
opportunity
of
immediate
flight
by
water
there
were
two
boats
on
the
moat
ready
for
any
such
emergency
the
governor
left
me
standing
outside
of
the
low
wall
that
skirted
the
moat
crossed
one
of
the
crumbling
old
bridges
and
entered
the
tower
through
an
arched
doorway
solemn
and
ponderous
as
if
it
had
withstood
the
storms
of
many
a
dreadful
siege
in
a
few
minutes
the
laotian
came
running
out
crying
o
i
love
you
dearly
i
love
you
dearly
i
am
so
happy
come
in
come
in
and
see
the
prince
so
saying
she
pulled
me
after
her
into
that
singular
old
edifice
which
i
must
confess
inspired
me
with
a
dread
that
i
could
not
overcome
nor
could
i
divest
myself
of
the
feeling
that
i
was
under
the
influence
of
some
wild
fantastic
dream
the
only
floor
of
the
old
tower
for
there
was
but
one
consisted
of
three
rooms
one
was
rather
large
and
might
have
been
in
its
best
days
of
a
vermilion
color
but
was
now
utterly
discolored
by
great
patches
made
by
which
had
changed
it
to
a
dull
yellowish
muddy
hue
it
was
an
ancient
and
apartment
with
all
manner
of
rusty
and
antique
indian
armor
shields
banners
spears
swords
bows
and
arrows
and
lances
ranged
along
the
wall
which
seemed
to
have
been
wielded
by
men
of
gigantic
stature
and
pointed
to
an
epoch
beyond
the
memory
of
the
present
race
passing
through
this
hall
we
entered
another
and
smaller
room
the
walls
of
which
had
also
once
been
painted
with
gigantic
flowers
birds
and
beasts
among
which
the
figure
of
the
crocodile
was
most
conspicuous
it
contained
a
bed
of
state
which
looked
like
indian
bombay
workmanship
lifting
to
the
ceiling
a
high
solemn
canopy
of
that
ponderous
flowered
silk
called
kinkaub
i
can
not
depict
the
scene
how
the
glimmering
light
within
and
the
changing
lights
without
reflected
from
the
dark
green
waters
touched
upon
and
singled
out
for
a
momentary
illumination
one
after
another
the
picturesque
arms
and
the
gigantic
pictures
on
the
walls
and
diffused
an
air
of
mystery
over
the
whole
illustration
a
laotian
welcome
welcome
brave
friend
said
one
of
the
three
dark
young
men
i
found
seated
within
who
rose
and
came
to
meet
me
with
a
singular
gesture
of
courtesy
and
respect
and
whom
i
at
once
recognized
from
his
strong
likeness
to
the
princess
sunartha
vismita
to
be
the
prince
karmatha
the
prince
for
it
was
he
with
an
excitement
he
could
not
quite
control
inquired
if
i
had
seen
his
sister
as
i
spoke
drew
near
and
listened
to
what
i
said
with
intense
interest
and
anxiety
expressed
in
her
fine
face
but
when
i
handed
the
prince
the
letter
they
were
all
inexpressibly
delighted
all
the
others
waited
anxiously
turning
silent
looks
of
sympathy
and
affection
on
him
as
he
read
it
first
to
himself
and
then
aloud
to
the
party
were
the
only
two
words
i
understood
of
its
contents
but
i
saw
two
big
drops
like
fall
suddenly
from
the
eyes
of
on
the
blotted
yellow
paper
and
his
voice
died
away
in
a
hoarse
whisper
as
he
concluded
the
strange
epistle
after
which
the
party
were
silent
saying
nothing
for
nearly
a
whole
hour
as
it
appeared
to
me
and
absorbed
each
with
his
own
thoughts
then
cast
an
upward
glance
as
if
in
prayer
and
crept
quietly
to
his
side
and
looked
at
him
with
the
calm
deep
determination
of
high
and
noble
resolve
depicted
on
her
fine
face
the
two
faces
presented
the
strongest
contrast
possible
the
one
dark
troubled
impetuous
and
weak
the
other
resolute
passionate
unchangeable
and
brave
i
wanted
no
further
proof
of
the
nature
of
the
friendship
which
bore
to
the
young
prince
and
his
sister
there
are
times
when
one
almost
knows
what
is
passing
in
the
mind
of
another
thus
it
was
that
i
was
able
to
form
some
glimmering
conception
of
the
elevated
character
of
the
before
me
it
was
time
for
me
to
go
the
prince
begged
me
to
take
something
from
him
by
way
of
compensation
but
i
declined
thanking
him
all
the
same
and
carrying
away
with
me
only
loving
words
of
comfort
and
hope
to
his
sister
and
her
companions
followed
me
out
and
her
fine
face
for
the
oftener
i
saw
it
the
finer
it
looked
was
never
more
expressive
than
when
she
thanked
me
and
bade
me
tell
her
beloved
mistress
to
keep
a
stout
heart
adding
in
a
whisper
i
do
not
know
what
i
am
going
to
do
but
something
shall
be
done
to
save
her
even
if
i
die
for
it
it
was
in
vain
that
i
urged
her
to
be
patient
and
not
to
do
anything
so
rash
as
to
attempt
the
rescue
of
the
princess
nothing
that
i
could
say
would
move
her
from
her
purpose
the
day
though
it
commenced
brightly
now
began
to
be
overcast
and
the
tide
was
turning
for
bangkok
so
i
left
her
as
we
parted
she
was
standing
in
one
of
the
long
corridors
with
her
hands
folded
and
raised
high
above
her
head
and
a
flood
of
tender
emotions
brimming
over
into
her
eyes
chapter

narrative
of
the
princess
of
chiengmai
my
good
friend
thieng
arranged
another
interview
for
me
with
the
princess
who
seemed
wonderfully
improved
in
health
and
spirits
and
who
related
to
me
almost
word
for
word
the
following
narrative
the
prince
karmatha
and
i
are
the
only
children
of
the
prince
chow
soorwang
the
brother
of
the
present
king
of
chiengmai
chiengmai
is
now
tributary
to
siam
but
there
was
a
time
when
my
ancestors
were
the
independent
sovereigns
of
all
the
land
lying
between
pegu
and
birmah
on
the
one
hand
and
siam
and
the
mountains
of
yunan
on
the
other
it
was
the
prince
chow
karmatha
after
whom
my
brother
was
named
who
founded
the
beautiful
city
of
chiengmai
and
built
those
stupendous
works
which
bring
water
to
its
inhabitants
my
poor
mother
died
at
the
time
of
my
birth
and
mother
brought
me
up
as
if
i
were
her
own
child
and
thus
and
i
became
sisters
in
the
flesh
as
we
are
indeed
in
spirit
my
brother
the
prince
is
just
seven
years
my
elder
he
was
fond
of
pleasure
but
he
loved
glory
and
honor
and
independence
still
more
and
it
was
ever
a
source
of
mortification
to
him
that
our
house
should
be
obliged
to
pay
the
triennial
tribute
which
the
sovereign
of
siam
exacts
as
our
homage
of
fealty
it
was
on
one
of
these
occasions
when
my
brother
became
the
representative
of
our
uncle
and
the
hearer
of
the
gold
and
silver
trees
to
the
court
of
siam
that
he
met
with
his
royal
highness
somdetch
pawarendr
ramasr
the
second
king
of
siam
being
both
fond
of
the
chase
and
experienced
hunters
they
formed
a
strong
friendship
the
one
for
the
other
god
forbid
that
i
should
disparage
the
supreme
king
of
siam
but
every
one
who
knows
them
will
admit
the
superiority
of
the
younger
brother
said
the
lady
proudly
soon
after
this
the
second
king
came
on
a
visit
to
our
home
and
accompanied
my
brother
on
many
a
hunting
expedition
i
can
not
describe
to
you
my
first
meeting
with
the
prince
whose
praises
had
already
inflamed
my
imagination
if
i
could
coin
words
of
deeper
meaning
or
if
i
could
learn
from
the
angels
some
new
language
wherein
fitly
to
clothe
the
higher
and
purer
joy
that
fell
upon
me
in
his
presence
i
might
reveal
to
you
something
of
the
charm
and
the
spell
of
that
hour
when
he
at
length
returned
to
sarapure
i
was
as
one
who
had
lost
the
of
her
existence
my
brother
apprehending
the
cause
of
my
grief
sent
unknown
to
me
to
sarapure
to
serve
in
any
capacity
whatever
in
the
palace
of
the
prince
and
to
discover
if
possible
the
state
of
his
affections
and
her
mother
set
out
for
the
palace
of
ban
sitha
having
arrived
there
she
contrived
to
get
admission
into
the
harem
of
the
prince
in
order
to
visit
some
of
her
friends
while
there
she
drew
out
of
her
vest
a
silver
flute
and
played
it
so
exquisitely
for
she
is
the
best
musician
in
our
country
and
can
perform
on
ten
different
instruments
that
she
charmed
her
hearers
who
at
once
introduced
her
to
the
chief
lady
of
the
khoon
klieb
who
purchased
her
from
her
mother
and
presented
her
to
the
prince
her
master
she
was
then
invited
to
perform
before
the
prince
he
too
was
delighted
with
her
wonderful
skill
and
power
and
being
at
the
time
in
ill
health
and
feeble
in
body
he
hardly
ever
left
his
palace
and
retained
her
almost
always
by
his
side
on
one
occasion
seeing
that
she
had
soothed
and
charmed
the
unhappy
and
suffering
prince
with
her
melodies
she
begged
permission
to
sing
him
a
song
of
her
own
composition
set
to
his
favorite
air
of
mânee
chaitee
the
lament
of
the
heart
the
prince
smilingly
assented
not
without
as
he
afterwards
told
me
surprise
and
wonder
at
the
singular
hardihood
and
fearlessness
of
the
young
stranger
to
use
his
own
words
sang
her
wonderful
song
with
such
power
such
a
sweet
mixture
of
the
fragrance
of
the
heart
with
the
melody
of
touch
that
the
memory
of
it
lingers
still
with
me
as
a
dream
of
a
day
in
suan
swarg
paradise
then
i
snatched
from
her
hand
the
lute
and
struck
on
it
in
wild
and
imperfect
utterances
the
burden
of
my
love
for
thee
dear
sunartha
vismita
just
three
months
from
the
time
of
departure
when
i
had
become
weary
and
disconsolate
because
of
her
unaccountable
absence
she
returned
home
bearing
letters
and
presents
from
the
prince
and
a
month
afterwards
i
set
out
a
happy
bride
for
the
beautiful
palace
of
ban
sitha
when
we
arrived
at
sarapure
my
brother
went
on
before
to
announce
my
arrival
to
the
prince
here
she
ceased
suddenly
and
gave
way
to
a
burst
of
passionate
tears
after
a
little
while
she
resumed
her
story
saying
and
so
we
were
privately
married
the
prince
however
had
long
been
failing
in
health
and
after
a
few
short
months
of
unalloyed
happiness
he
again
fell
grievously
sick
and
exhorted
me
to
return
home
to
my
father
lest
by
his
death
i
should
fall
into
the
power
of
his
elder
brother
but
i
refused
to
leave
him
and
followed
him
to
his
palace
at
bangkok
where
he
sickened
rapidly
and
died
his
last
words
to
me
were
thee
well
sunartha
thy
presence
has
been
to
me
like
the
light
of
the
setting
sun
illumining
and
dispersing
the
dark
clouds
which
have
hitherto
obscured
my
sad
life
fear
not
i
will
keep
the
memory
of
thy
face
bright
and
unclouded
before
my
fading
eyes
as
i
pass
away
rejoicing
in
thy
love
a
short
time
after
my
husband
death
i
found
myself
a
prisoner
in
his
palace
and
as
time
passed
on
i
was
removed
to
this
palace
where
a
residence
befitting
a
queen
was
appointed
to
me
and
where
i
first
had
the
honor
of
receiving
and
entertaining
the
elder
brother
of
my
husband
the
great
king
maha
mongkut
who
ignoring
my
deep
sorrow
and
deeper
love
for
my
late
husband
offered
me
his
royal
hand
in
marriage
openly
and
proudly
i
rejected
the
cruel
offer
for
which
reason
i
am
here
again
a
prisoner
and
perchance
will
remain
forever
she
ceased
speaking
and
the
amazon
entered
to
say
it
was
time
to
shut
the
prison
door
with
her
lips
firmly
pressed
together
her
nostrils
quivering
and
her
head
bowed
in
her
strong
grief
she
motioned
me
her
adieux
i
saw
her
once
or
twice
afterwards
sitting
leisurely
among
the
palace
gardens
under
the
watchful
eyes
of
the
amazonian
guard

my
boy
and
i
made
the
most
of
our
visit
to
this
delightful
region
rambling
over
the
hills
and
forests
gathering
wild
flowers
and
visiting
the
hot
springs
caves
and
grottos
which
form
some
of
the
more
interesting
features
of
the
neighborhood
in
the
foreground
near
the
stood
a
clump
of
ferns
full
of
pictures
a
little
farther
on
was
a
cave
over
the
mouth
of
which
trailed
huge
convolvuli
and
immediately
above
it
an
overhanging
rock
variegated
with
natural
tints
and
colors
the
effect
of
which
was
most
wonderful
from
this
spot
there
were
tempting
walks
through
groves
of
dark
green
trees
opening
upon
wide
terraces
which
commanded
exquisite
views
of
the
country
rich
with
cultivation
or
dotted
with
houses
and
gardens
or
the
still
more
fertile
valleys
winding
amongst
which
might
be
traced
the
silvery
thread
of
the
diamond
river
not
far
from
the
royal
mountain
are
several
grottos
two
of
which
are
of
surprising
extent
and
great
beauty
an
exact
painting
of
which
would
be
looked
upon
with
incredulity
or
as
an
invention
of
fairy
land
whatever
may
have
been
the
origin
of
these
grottos
owing
to
the
moisture
continually
dropping
through
the
damp
soil
of
the
rocks
they
have
been
clothed
with
the
richest
and
most
harmonious
colors
and
adorned
with
magnificent
stalactites
which
rise
in
innumerable
slender
shafts
and
columns
to
support
the
roof
and
walls
the
setting
sun
reveals
a
gorgeous
mass
of
coloring
ending
in
dark
blue
and
purple
shadows
in
the
distant
chambers
and
hollows
i
never
witnessed
such
wonderfully
illusive
transformations
as
the
sunlight
effected
wherever
it
penetrated
these
subterranean
halls
no
human
hands
have
as
yet
touched
their
marvellous
walls
and
roofs
and
pillars
all
that
has
been
done
by
man
is
to
cut
a
staircase
in
the
rock
to
aid
the
descent
into
the
grottos
and
enable
the
visitor
to
see
them
in
all
their
regal
beauty
the
largest
grotto
has
been
converted
into
a
buddhist
temple
all
along
the
richly
tinted
are
contemplative
images
of
the
buddha
and
in
the
centre
just
where
is
concentrated
the
richest
depth
of
coloring
lying
on
a
horizontal
bed
of
rock
is
a
large
sleeping
idol
of
the
same
inevitable
figure
with
the
same
mysterious
expression
about
the
closed
eyelids
as
if
he
were
in
the
habit
even
in
sleep
of
penetrating
distant
worlds
in
his
longing
to
gaze
upon
the
infinite
lower
down
the
mountain
lies
a
calm
lake
with
its
smooth
silvery
surface
ever
and
anon
broken
by
the
leaping
of
a
fish
as
if
to
prove
that
it
is
water
and
not
glass
and
beyond
the
lake
are
more
mountains
rolling
up
into
the
sky
in
purple
and
green
folds
with
the
faintest
of
blue
borders
and
edges
for
they
are
many
miles
off
it
was
evening
and
we
had
just
spent
a
delicious
fortnight
here
teaching
in
the
mornings
and
rambling
in
the
evenings
and
his
majesty
had
assured
me
to
my
great
delight
that
we
should
stay
yet
another
while
among
the
mountains
my
boy
and
i
had
retired
to
our
little
rocky
nest
around
which
there
was
an
impression
of
savage
grandeur
and
of
loneliness
almost
overpowering
and
where
i
used
to
imagine
the
hill
giants
of
whom
i
had
heard
so
much
lurking
in
secret
in
the
caves
and
hollows
as
ready
to
tear
the
royal
mountain
from
its
base
and
cast
it
into
the
gulf
beyond
for
the
pitiless
way
in
which
the
monarch
doomed
those
poor
five
hundred
slaves
to
toil
on
and
on
without
any
prospect
of
ever
coming
to
an
end
in
smoothing
and
shaping
its
rugged
sides
and
it
was
here
that
i
first
realized
and
appreciated
the
belief
of
the
simple
people
about
me
in
ghosts
and
spirits
pleasant
and
unpleasant
genii
in
the
air
and
spirits
in
the
evening
breeze
and
gentle
ghosts
with
eyes
as
fair
as
starbeams
through
the
twilight
trees
but
in
spite
of
them
all
we
were
sleeping
soundly
that
night
in
the
third
story
of
our
little
eyry
when
about
three
in
the
morning
the
sound
of
tocsins
gongs
and
trumpets
was
flung
out
all
over
the
distant
hills
and
mountains
and
tauntingly
like
the
cry
of
so
many
demons
full
of
mad
sport
in
the
multitudinous
voices
of
the
rocky
solitudes
we
were
suddenly
transported
from
deep
sleep
to
realities
to
find
the
royal
palace
all
alive
with
lights
and
sedans
and
horsemen
and
shadowy
phantoms
issuing
from
dark
portals
gliding
hither
and
thither
among
the
rocks
and
coming
towards
us
what
did
it
all
mean
the
whole
thing
looked
so
mysterious
that
i
at
first
thought
the
king
was
dead
or
that
the
palace
was
besieged
or
that
the
favorite
peam
taking
advantage
of
the
mountain
fastnesses
had
run
away
the
torchlight
phantoms
proved
to
be
veritable
brawny
amazons
who
came
to
inform
us
that
the
court
would
return
to
bangkok
within
an
hour
what
not
stay
another
fortnight
i
inquired
sadly
no
not
another
hour
get
ready
to
follow
was
the
peremptory
order
and
so
on
the
third
day
succeeding
we
were
all
settled
down
in
our
respective
places
at
bangkok
chapter
xxiii
the
deaf
and
dumb
changeling
in
the
next
morning
cheerful
daylight
i
set
out
to
resume
once
more
my
school
routine
within
the
sombre
walls
of
the
invincible
city
but
as
we
proceeded
on
our
way
we
were
surprised
to
see
knots
and
clusters
of
people
reading
with
absorbing
interest
huge
placards
written
in
siamese
pali
cambodian
birmese
peguan
and
every
other
language
spoken
by
the
many
distinct
peoples
who
inhabit
the
mountains
and
valleys
watered
by
the
great
river
mèinam
and
posted
all
along
the
imperial
walls
here
was
another
mystery
i
could
read
printed
siamese
and
pali
tolerably
well
but
the
written
characters
wherein
every
scholar
invents
an
orthography
of
his
own
baffled
all
my
linguistic
efforts
and
not
a
glimmering
of
light
could
the
numberless
questions
i
put
to
many
of
the
curious
readers
procure
for
me
they
were
as
afraid
to
speak
of
royalty
as
of
the
devil
lest
he
should
appear
so
i
went
on
to
school
to
find
the
same
mysterious
announcements
which
had
sprung
up
like
mushrooms
during
the
night
running
zigzag
over
all
the
walls
and
playing
hide
and
seek
along
the
dark
narrow
lanes
and
streets
only
to
elude
my
strictest
inquiries
now
to
tell
the
truth
as
i
was
treasonably
disposed
against
slavery
and
polygamy
and
several
other
gross
abuses
that
grew
out
of
them
and
had
stoutly
set
my
face
against
them
from
the
very
first
day
of
my
installation
as
teacher
in
the
palace
i
began
to
fear
that
these
placards
might
concern
me
and
my
teachings
so
when
school
closed
i
went
to
see
my
friend
lady
thieng
but
she
was
even
more
mysterious
than
the
unintelligible
hieroglyphics
on
the
walls
looking
at
me
curiously
and
shaking
her
head
in
a
solemn
manner
and
feeling
me
all
over
in
a
pathetic
way
so
as
to
reassure
herself
that
i
was
not
a
spirit
but
made
of
flesh
and
bones
like
herself
and
could
not
have
been
as
she
had
begun
secretly
to
suspect
at
bijrepuree
and
at
bangkok
at
the
same
time
she
then
gravely
asked
me
if
i
had
ever
practised
sorcery
or
witchcraft
my
lips
trembled
with
irrepressible
laughter
as
i
assured
her
i
had
not
as
yet
enjoyed
the
good
fortune
of
knowing
a
real
witch
but
that
nothing
in
the
world
would
please
me
better
than
to
be
introduced
to
one
who
would
give
me
lessons
in
that
art
she
admonished
me
sternly
for
my
levity
and
went
on
to
say
that
there
had
really
been
a
very
powerful
sorceress
in
the
palace
during
the
king
absence
at
bijrepuree
who
had
unseen
by
human
eye
conjured
away
the
beautiful
and
disconsolate
princess
and
left
in
her
place
a
rustic
deaf
and
dumb
amazed
and
altogether
taken
by
surprise
i
looked
into
my
face
in
unspeakable
sorrow
my
heart
whispered
to
me
the
last
words
of
i
do
not
know
what
i
am
going
to
do
but
something
shall
be
done
to
save
her
even
if
i
die
for
it
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
ask
another
question
i
was
so
afraid
of
confirming
my
worst
fears
i
had
learned
to
love
that
better
than
her
mistress
and
would
have
braved
a
thousand
perils
if
i
had
thought
i
could
save
her
through
them
i
wish
cried
thieng
at
last
in
a
sudden
burst
as
if
her
thoughts
had
been
going
on
in
this
strain
and
only
broke
from
her
when
she
could
restrain
herself
no
longer
i
wish
that
this
deaf
and
dumb
could
be
exorcised
and
made
to
speak
and
then
we
would
know
how
it
happened
and
how
the
old
witch
looked
o
dear
o
dear
i
am
afraid
for
my
life
and
the
lives
of
my
poor
children
and
even
the
very
stones
out
of
which
this
dismal
city
is
built
inspire
me
with
dread
and
horror
said
poor
thieng
ruefully
and
do
you
know
she
added
her
eyes
growing
rounder
and
rounder
every
moment
as
the
awfulness
of
the
situation
presented
itself
to
her
mind
his
majesty
has
shut
himself
up
in
his
topmost
chamber
and
guards
are
set
at
all
the
doors
and
windows
lest
any
person
should
enter
and
no
one
but
only
the
old
khoon
maw
prang
is
allowed
to
see
him
to
serve
his
meals
and
he
wo
come
down
till
the
palace
and
whole
city
has
been
exorcised
and
there
will
be
no
school
she
continued
growing
more
and
more
communicative
for
he
has
ordered
all
the
royal
children
to
be
shut
up
in
their
homes
until
noon
when
the
old
devil
shall
have
been
driven
out
by
the
priests
of
brahma
and
the
priests
of
buddha
will
then
purify
the
city
with
burning
incense
and
sprinkling
the
houses
walls
and
all
its
inhabitants
with
holy
water
up
to
the
last
moment
a
natural
cause
for
the
disappearance
of
the
princess
sunartha
vismita
never
even
presented
itself
to
the
mind
of
my
friend
and
i
was
not
a
little
comforted
for
the
sake
of
the
strange
laotian
woman
to
find
that
it
was
thought
so
absolutely
the
work
of
some
supernatural
agent
for
thieng
also
told
me
that
the
court
astrologers
and
wizards
were
trying
to
unravel
the
mystery
that
large
rewards
had
been
promised
to
them
if
they
could
throw
any
light
on
the
subject
and
lastly
that
the
two
laotian
captives
with
the
deaf
and
dumb
changeling
were
to
be
exorcised
and
examined
in
the
ecclesiastical
court
on
the
following
day
by
the
wise
men
and
women
in
the
country
after
which
the
poor
unhappy
lady
laid
her
head
down
upon
her
pillow
utterly
grieved
and
terrified
by
her
fears
i
tried
in
vain
to
comfort
her
but
what
between
her
dread
of
the
supernatural
and
her
misgivings
that
the
chances
were
that
certain
accusations
against
herself
and
me
as
secret
agents
of
some
devilish
sorceress
might
be
brought
forward
with
unanswerable
logic
she
was
quite
inconsolable
and
greatly
to
be
pitied
i
believe
she
would
have
been
content
to
give
her
life
ere
day
broke
only
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
poor
unfortunate
princess
whom
the
demon
had
thus
maliciously
kidnapped
and
carried
off
the
only
thing
i
could
say
that
seemed
in
the
slightest
degree
to
soothe
her
was
that
i
would
endeavor
to
be
present
at
the
ecclesiastical
court
at
the
time
appointed
for
the
exorcism
and
obtain
such
intelligence
of
its
proceedings
and
the
facts
elicited
during
the
trial
as
my
imperfect
knowledge
of
the
technical
language
and
formalities
of
the
siamese
courts
would
enable
me
to
gather
for
her
chapter
xxiv
witchcraft
in
siam
in
eighteen
hundred
and
compared
with
witchcraft
in
england
in
seventeen
hundred
and
sixteen
it
might
be
difficult
at
the
present
time
anywhere
in
any
enlightened
christian
community
to
find
persons
of
the
most
ordinary
intelligence
who
entertain
the
smallest
faith
in
witchcraft
but
yet
there
are
thousands
upon
thousands
who
implicitly
believe
in
and
in
in
mesmerism
and
animal
magnetism
and
in
joseph
smith
and
brigham
young
his
successor
who
exhibits
such
extraordinary
powers
in
prophecy
and
sensualism
at
utah
and
in
fact
it
would
seem
that
the
doctrine
of
credo
quia
impossibile
never
had
more
earnest
disciples
than
it
now
numbers
yet
we
all
alike
with
one
accord
profess
our
utter
disbelief
in
witchcraft
illustration
an
amazon
of
the
royal
body
guard
this
scepticism
on
our
part
however
is
of
very
modern
date
for
even
in
the
early
part
of
this
century
the
belief
was
not
quite
eradicated
in
england
and
we
have
only
to
step
back
a
century
more
to
find
it
acknowledged
without
shame
by
a
civilized
and
highly
enlightened
people
and
at
a
time
too
when
the
literary
intellect
of
england
shone
as
brightly
as
ever
in
her
history
when
the
memory
of
dryden
was
still
fresh
in
the
minds
of
many
of
his
most
cherished
friends
and
admirers
when
pope
had
risen
and
addison
was
painting
his
genial
portrait
of
sir
roger
de
coverly
when
the
bewitching
nightingale
at
twickenham
poured
forth
his
sweetest
songs
and
steele
and
swift
stern
incorrigible
and
lonely
domineered
over
the
proudest
of
english
peers
and
statesmen
nothing
can
ever
be
more
touching
than
the
sad
record
of
those
dark
days
when
the
fair
eleanor
cobham
the
wife
of
a
duke
and
the
aunt
of
a
king
of
great
britain
did
penance
for
her
witchcraft
and
walked
hoodless
save
her
through
all
the
crowded
streets
of
london
and
westminster
taunted
and
hooted
at
by
a
ragged
crowd
to
offer
a
consecrated
taper
at
the
high
altar
of
paul
and
thence
to
her
cruel
imprisonment
at
kenilworth
while
her
wretched
accomplice
bolingbroke
expiated
his
crime
on
a
gibbet
at
tyburn
and
there
are
those
seemingly
darker
days
when
archbishop
cranmer
a
of
the
tender
jesus
directed
his
clergy
at
large
to
make
strict
inquiry
into
all
witchcraft
and
such
like
craft
invented
by
the
devil
and
when
that
very
honorable
personage
the
lord
chief
justice
coke
uttered
these
memorable
words
it
would
be
a
great
defect
in
government
if
so
great
an
abomination
had
passed
with
impunity
then
no
one
cast
even
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
on
the
existence
of
witchcraft
or
even
questioned
the
extraordinary
powers
which
were
at
the
time
imputed
to
a
witch
and
one
becomes
sensible
of
the
dark
superstitions
that
must
have
pervaded
even
the
general
atmosphere
of
the
immortal
poet
shakespeare
when
he
makes
ford
lay
his
cudgel
across
the
shoulders
of
falstaff
supposing
him
to
be
the
wise
woman
of
brentford
and
embodies
the
grander
and
more
terrible
idea
of
witchcraft
as
no
man
has
ever
done
before
or
after
him
in
the
tragedy
of
macbeth
almost
every
page
of
ecclesiastical
history
of
ancient
times
is
full
of
monstrous
relations
of
the
powers
of
the
devil
or
of
those
who
had
entered
into
copartnership
with
him
and
emerging
thence
into
the
light
of
more
recent
times
we
shall
find
the
same
superstition
in
such
men
as
matthew
hopkins
the
in
matthew
hale
presiding
at
the
trial
of
the
bury
edmunds
witches
and
in
sir
thomas
browne
author
of
the
religio
medici
and
of
the
inquiry
into
vulgar
errors
giving
the
evidence
on
which
so
many
wretched
old
and
young
women
were
sent
to
the
gallows
but
alas
what
shall
we
say
when
we
hear
such
holy
men
as
baxter
and
wesley
asserting
that
the
belief
in
witchcraft
was
essentially
connected
with
christianity
and
one
of
its
most
important
points
and
down
almost
to
our
own
day
find
johnson
half
doubting
and
half
believing
in
the
existence
of
witches
and
in
their
supernatural
powers
it
was
not
until
the
close
of
that
the
statute
which
made
witchcraft
a
felony
punishable
by
death
was
repealed
and
so
lately
as
the
curious
reader
will
find
in
gough
vol
an
account
of
a
substantial
english
farmer
named
hicks
who
publicly
accused
his
wife
and
child
a
girl
of
only
nine
years
of
age
of
witchcraft
and
what
seems
more
incredible
still
that
they
were
actually
tried
at
the
assizes
at
huntingdon
before
a
learned
judge
and
visited
by
pious
and
divines
to
whom
the
poor
victims
confessed
the
belief
which
was
forced
into
their
own
convictions
by
the
strong
current
of
public
opinion
and
still
more
by
the
unnatural
conduct
of
a
father
and
a
husband
that
they
were
witches
for
which
the
unhappy
wife
and
tender
child
were
hanged
at
huntingdon
on
the
of
july
can
any
page
in
the
history
of
siam
be
more
appalling
than
this
let
the
reader
turn
from
england
in
her
light
and
glory
her
civilization
refinement
and
power
from
her
altars
raised
to
the
true
god
and
centuries
after
her
baptism
in
the
matchless
name
of
christ
to
benighted
siam
still
bound
in
the
iron
fetters
of
paganism
idolatry
and
slavery
and
he
will
find
there
in
many
respects
just
such
a
picture
as
england
presented
in
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
nothing
can
be
more
appalling
than
the
incurable
superstition
of
the
eastern
mind
and
even
while
their
belief
in
the
supernatural
inspires
them
with
perpetual
horror
they
can
not
be
brought
to
give
it
up
in
fact
it
seems
a
part
of
their
nature
to
cherish
in
their
secret
hearts
the
belief
that
there
are
spirits
good
and
bad
who
walk
the
earth
unseen
and
delight
either
to
bless
or
to
cheat
and
abuse
mankind
and
that
there
are
witches
and
wizards
in
the
country
who
have
the
power
of
turning
men
into
any
shape
they
choose
rational
and
reasonable
on
all
other
points
as
the
siamese
are
the
moment
you
try
to
approach
them
through
their
religious
senses
they
appear
like
a
world
coming
suddenly
under
an
eclipse
of
the
sun
slowly
and
surely
the
disk
of
their
mind
is
darkened
and
the
gloom
and
perplexity
increase
till
it
becomes
completely
obscured
chapter
xxv
trial
for
witchcraft
no
one
who
has
had
the
good
or
bad
fortune
to
alight
in
the
northeastern
portion
of
the
city
of
bangkok
can
ever
forget
the
temples
and
monasteries
of
brahmanee
wade
they
are
situated
by
themselves
at
the
northeastern
extremity
of
the
city
walls
where
not
a
modern
building
is
to
be
seen
for
even
the
few
houses
which
were
erected
as
lately
as
yesterday
have
been
fashioned
after
the
ancient
model
prescribed
by
the
hindoo
architect
and
in
no
part
of
the
world
is
there
seen
so
perfect
an
historical
picture
of
the
ancient
brahminical
architecture
as
in
this
part
of
the
city
of
bangkok
the
varied
gables
the
quaint
little
windows
the
fantastic
towers
and
narrow
doorways
with
the
endless
effects
of
color
make
this
spot
a
perpetual
delight
to
the
curious
traveller
and
the
brahmins
who
occupy
this
part
of
the
city
allotted
to
them
from
time
immemorial
by
the
kings
of
siam
still
preserve
the
ancient
costume
of
their
forefathers
which
makes
the
picture
complete
on
the
morning
of
the
of
november
three
women
half
stupefied
by
the
foul
air
of
the
damp
cells
in
which
they
had
been
immured
were
conducted
through
the
silent
sleeping
streets
of
the
palace
and
city
to
a
small
room
or
black
hole
adjoining
the
great
of
the
temple
of
brahmanee
wade
and
locked
up
therein
while
the
file
of
amazons
and
the
troop
of
soldiers
in
charge
took
their
places
around
it
while
the
invincible
city
was
being
disenchanted
by
one
set
of
brahmins
to
be
purified
by
another
set
of
buddhist
priests
i
set
off
on
horseback
attended
only
by
my
hindostanee
syce
or
groom
to
the
scene
of
the
trial
november
here
is
the
pleasantest
month
in
the
year
and
the
morning
sun
shone
brightly
but
not
too
warmly
as
we
approached
the
walls
of
the
temples
and
monasteries
of
brahmanee
wade
so
wild
so
isolated
so
set
in
contrast
by
oddness
of
architectural
effects
to
the
general
order
and
appearance
of
the
rest
of
the
town
as
to
seem
indeed
to
belong
to
another
age
and
another
world
the
dark
walls
and
huge
trees
were
covered
with
parasitic
plants
a
deep
narrow
valley
through
which
a
tiny
streamlet
runs
over
a
stony
bed
betwixt
sloping
sides
of
grass
and
steeps
is
crossed
by
a
stone
bridge
black
with
time
which
leads
to
the
portals
of
brahminism
the
little
mad
stream
roared
and
fled
darkly
on
as
it
will
perhaps
forever
there
was
a
dreadful
loneliness
about
the
place
and
a
sort
of
darkness
too
whether
in
my
mind
or
in
the
place
i
can
not
say
but
it
spoke
of
all
kinds
of
magic
and
witchcraft
and
even
of
devilcraft
deep
in
the
glen
sloping
down
to
the
stream
amid
picturesque
and
romantic
surroundings
stood
the
old
temple
of
kalee
durga
and
running
along
like
a
huge
jagged
shadow
dark
even
in
the
brightest
sunlight
rose
the
roofs
of
the
monastic
dwellings
of
the
brahmin
ascetics
from
which
the
place
is
named
i
alighted
and
told
my
syce
to
wait
outside
for
me
but
he
being
a
pious
hindoo
bestrode
the
pony
and
rode
off
to
return
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
with
oil
and
fresh
flowers
and
sweetmeats
enough
to
propitiate
a
great
many
dark
goddesses
there
was
not
a
soul
to
be
seen
anywhere
whether
of
brahmanic
or
buddhistic
faith
so
i
followed
my
syce
into
the
temple
and
while
he
prostrated
himself
at
full
length
before
each
one
of
his
gods
i
took
out
my
and
occupied
myself
in
making
sketches
and
memoranda
of
the
strange
scene
before
me
vishnu
siva
krishna
and
the
goddess
kalee
were
the
chief
deities
of
the
place
and
figured
as
the
heroes
and
heroines
among
the
numerous
grotesque
and
monstrous
myths
sculptured
on
the
walls
here
was
vishnu
lying
comfortably
on
the
snake
shesha
or
sporting
as
a
fish
or
crawling
as
a
tortoise
or
showing
his
fangs
as
a
wild
boar
or
shaking
his
head
in
his
last
and
fifth
as
a
dwarf
all
admirably
executed
here
too
was
krishna
like
another
apollo
whipped
out
of
heaven
for
playing
tricks
on
the
lovely
shepherdesses
of
muttra
whose
tender
hearts
he
stole
away
and
whose
butter
he
found
so
tempting
that
he
perpetually
ran
off
with
it
in
secret
and
whose
jars
of
milk
it
was
this
madcap
pleasure
roguishly
to
upset
in
another
compartment
crumbling
with
age
he
is
seen
again
in
his
last
mad
prank
perched
on
a
stony
tree
with
the
stony
habiliments
under
his
arm
and
an
unmistakable
grin
on
his
stony
greasy
face
while
the
owners
of
the
dresses
are
standing
below
in
various
attitudes
of
bashfulness
imploring
their
restoration
before
them
in
different
places
stands
the
lingam
here
was
also
a
beautiful
sculpture
of
siva
and
his
wife
parvati
with
the
sacred
bull
nandi
lying
at
their
feet
and
kalee
in
combat
with
the
monster
mahashasura
and
close
by
again
she
is
seen
caressing
a
nylghau
that
is
looking
up
to
her
the
figures
of
the
goddesses
are
wonderfully
spirited
and
of
exquisite
symmetry
conveying
the
idea
of
perfect
and
beautiful
womanhood
and
yet
kalee
is
represented
elsewhere
in
the
same
temple
as
a
black
and
terrible
being
covered
with
symbols
of
the
most
ferocious
cruelty
having
finished
my
notes
i
passed
out
by
another
entrance
and
tried
to
quiet
my
fears
for
by
continuing
my
rambles
and
explorations
until
instead
of
returning
home
for
that
meal
i
despatched
the
syce
to
buy
from
the
small
hindoo
village
close
by
an
earthen
lota
of
milk
and
a
flat
cake
of
bâjree
bread
of
which
i
made
a
pleasant
repast
sitting
under
the
deep
shadows
of
the
temples
and
trees
dedicated
to
brahma
of
whom
there
is
rarely
if
ever
any
representation
very
soon
i
was
repaid
for
my
patient
waiting
for
i
heard
the
sound
of
drums
beating
and
martial
music
playing
and
rushing
to
the
side
whence
it
proceeded
the
queerest
and
most
procession
met
my
astonished
eyes
old
women
dressed
in
scarlet
and
yellow
and
old
gray
headed
men
in
every
variety
of
costume
combining
all
the
known
and
unknown
fashions
of
the
past
some
on
foot
and
others
on
horseback
with
embroidered
flags
of
the
same
multiplicity
of
colors
flying
before
the
wind
and
in
the
centre
of
all
clad
in
black
and
crimson
vestments
riding
on
white
mules
a
band
of
about
twenty
men
and
women
some
quite
young
and
others
extremely
old
advancing
with
slow
and
solemn
steps
these
were
the
royal
astrologers
wizards
and
witches
who
incredible
as
it
may
seem
are
supported
by
the
supreme
king
of
siam
and
receive
from
the
crown
large
and
handsome
salaries
i
observed
that
the
whole
procession
was
composed
of
persons
of
the
hindoo
religion
in
the
rear
came
some
chinese
coolies
hired
for
the
occasion
carrying
two
boxes
and
two
long
planks
which
excited
my
curiosity
as
they
drew
near
they
were
joined
by
large
numbers
of
siamese
and
a
host
of
ragged
slaves
which
completed
the
motley
scene
i
stepped
out
of
the
solemn
shade
of
the
boh
and
peepul
trees
and
took
my
seat
on
a
broken
stone
pillar
still
under
shelter
and
commanding
a
view
of
the
grand
hall
the
roof
which
was
fast
crumbling
away
was
an
inferior
imitation
of
that
of
the
wondrous
temple
of
maha
nagkhon
watt
and
had
scarcely
been
touched
for
centuries
for
there
still
figured
the
inevitable
siva
and
kalee
and
all
the
rest
of
the
hindoo
gods
and
goddesses
dismantled
and
broken
but
still
in
sufficient
preservation
to
show
the
wild
grotesqueness
of
the
hindoo
imagination
which
seems
to
have
grown
riotous
in
the
effort
to
embody
all
its
imperfect
conceptions
of
the
divinity
when
this
strange
and
solemn
procession
entered
the
portal
of
brahmanee
wade
they
suddenly
halted
threw
up
their
arms
and
folded
their
hands
above
their
heads
and
repeated
one
of
the
most
magnificent
utterances
of
krishna
o
thou
who
art
the
life
in
all
things
the
eternal
seed
of
nature
the
understanding
of
the
wise
and
the
weakness
of
the
foolish
the
glory
of
the
proud
and
the
strength
of
the
strong
the
sacrifice
and
the
worship
the
incense
and
the
fire
the
victim
and
the
slayer
the
father
and
the
mother
of
the
world
gird
thy
servants
with
power
and
wisdom
to
slay
the
slayer
and
to
vanquish
the
deceiver
etc
after
which
they
marched
to
the
sound
of
music
into
the
temple
and
offered
sacrifices
of
wine
and
oil
and
wheaten
cakes
and
fresh
flowers
and
with
their
eyes
lifted
to
the
dark
vaulted
roof
they
again
prayed
calling
upon
brahma
the
father
the
comforter
the
creator
the
tender
mother
the
holy
way
the
witness
the
asylum
the
friend
of
man
to
illumine
with
the
light
of
his
understanding
their
feeble
intellects
to
discern
the
devil
and
to
vanquish
him
at
length
the
astrologers
wizards
and
witches
took
their
places
in
the
hall
with
eager
crowds
all
round
them
standing
in
rows
on
all
the
steps
of
the
building
then
came
two
officers
from
the
king
with
a
royal
letter
one
was
the
chief
judge
of
the
supreme
court
and
the
other
his
secretary
to
report
the
trial
after
this
lordly
personage
had
taken
his
seat
the
prisoners
the
two
handmaids
of
the
princess
and
my
friend
who
as
i
feared
was
the
deaf
and
dumb
changeling
were
brought
in
she
was
deadly
pale
and
there
was
a
wild
light
as
of
madness
or
intense
suffering
in
her
eyes
they
were
placed
at
the
end
of
the
hall
strongly
guarded
by
as
many
as
fifty
amazons
while
the
soldiers
scattered
themselves
all
round
about
the
building
not
a
word
was
spoken
and
the
strange
assembly
looked
into
one
another
faces
as
if
each
knew
his
neighbor
thoughts
i
trembled
for
the
unhappy
prisoners
and
the
crowd
who
seemed
to
look
upon
poor
as
a
veritable
witch
were
silent
in
breathless
expectation
it
was
a
frightful
spot
and
a
still
more
indescribably
terrifying
scene
where
one
might
indeed
say
with
hassan
of
balsora
lo
this
is
the
abode
of
genii
and
of
ghouls
and
of
devils
i
had
half
a
mind
to
slip
down
from
my
rocky
perch
and
run
away
but
very
soon
my
anxiety
for
poor
absorbed
every
other
feeling
the
three
prisoners
sat
profoundly
silent
waiting
in
sadness
to
hear
their
doom
but
why
did
they
not
begin
the
trial
there
were
the
boxes
and
the
planks
with
little
niches
cut
into
them
deep
enough
to
enable
any
nimble
person
to
climb
with
the
tips
of
their
toes
and
scale
any
wall
against
which
they
might
be
placed
i
turned
to
a
soldier
who
was
standing
close
by
and
asked
him
why
they
still
delayed
the
trial
they
are
waiting
said
he
as
if
he
knew
all
about
it
and
had
witnessed
many
such
scenes
before
for
the
or
holy
man
of
the
woods
it
is
for
him
that
they
have
blown
the
these
three
times
there
was
to
me
nothing
improbable
in
the
soldier
story
he
told
me
that
this
holy
man
or
yogi
lived
in
a
cave
in
the
rocks
adjoining
all
alone
and
that
he
rarely
issued
from
his
unknown
retreat
during
the
day
but
that
pious
hindoos
while
performing
their
ablutions
in
the
stream
after
the
close
of
their
labors
could
see
him
moving
in
the
moonlight
and
hear
him
calling
upon
god
feeding
on
tamarinds
and
other
wild
fruits
he
slept
during
the
day
like
a
wild
animal
and
prayed
aloud
all
night
oppressed
by
his
longing
and
yearning
after
the
invisible
as
by
some
secret
grief
that
knew
no
balm
even
the
cool
evening
air
brought
him
no
peace
for
at
night
the
passion
came
like
the
fierce
fiend
of
a
distempered
dream
and
shook
him
from
his
rest
and
led
him
forth
into
the
darkness
to
pray
and
pray
forevermore
by
and
by
a
man
appeared
on
the
opposite
banks
of
the
stream
plunged
into
it
and
emerged
on
the
hither
side
shook
the
wet
from
his
hair
like
a
veritable
beast
and
made
his
way
towards
the
hall
where
he
sat
himself
shyly
down
near
the
prisoners
this
strange
mortal
who
lived
the
life
of
an
had
a
remarkably
fine
sensitive
face
and
a
noble
head
around
which
his
long
matted
unkempt
hair
fell
like
dark
clouds
he
was
meagrely
clad
and
his
wiry
frame
gave
evidence
of
great
muscular
power
there
was
to
my
thinking
a
gleam
of
a
better
and
higher
humanity
in
his
fine
dark
face
that
shot
out
in
irrepressible
flashes
and
convinced
me
in
spite
of
his
filth
and
nudity
of
a
noble
and
impressive
nature
the
soldier
assured
me
in
a
tone
of
the
utmost
reverence
that
this
man
eyes
were
opened
that
he
could
see
things
which
the
paid
mercenaries
of
the
court
could
not
begin
even
to
comprehend
and
that
therefore
they
always
made
it
a
point
to
invite
him
to
aid
them
in
their
spiritual
examinations
i
somehow
drew
comfort
from
the
yogi
shy
and
fascinating
face
and
now
the
trial
commenced
by
the
judge
reading
the
king
letter
which
spoke
of
the
mysterious
and
important
nature
of
the
accusation
made
against
some
unknown
person
for
the
abduction
of
a
state
prisoner
a
lady
of
high
rank
and
unflinching
integrity
and
called
upon
the
assembly
to
do
their
utmost
to
unravel
the
inexplicable
affair
after
the
royal
letter
had
received
its
customary
salutations
and
at
the
command
of
the
judge
the
two
amazons
who
were
on
duty
on
the
night
of
the
abduction
of
the
princess
testified
to
the
following
facts
that
on
the
night
of
the
on
a
sudden
a
strong
wind
arose
that
extinguished
their
lanterns
leaving
them
in
utter
darkness
and
immediately
afterwards
they
were
sensible
that
a
tall
dark
figure
enveloped
in
a
black
veil
entered
the
hall
and
that
as
she
approached
them
they
saw
somewhat
indistinctly
that
she
held
a
short
dagger
in
one
hand
and
a
ponderous
bunch
of
keys
in
the
other
that
never
before
having
known
themselves
liable
to
any
illusion
of
the
senses
the
horror
which
fell
upon
them
at
the
moment
deprived
them
of
all
power
of
speech
or
action
that
as
the
strange
being
stood
over
them
brandishing
her
glittering
knife
there
flashed
all
round
about
her
a
hideous
light
that
by
this
light
they
saw
her
proceed
to
the
cell
in
which
the
princess
sunartha
vismita
was
confined
open
it
with
one
of
her
mysterious
keys
and
lead
the
princess
forth
pulling
her
forcibly
along
by
the
hand
and
as
the
flashes
died
away
a
double
darkness
fell
upon
them
that
after
an
interval
of
nearly
two
hours
as
they
were
still
paralyzed
and
unable
to
move
from
the
spot
the
strange
figure
reappeared
pallid
and
more
ghastly
than
before
but
without
the
veil
or
the
dagger
or
the
bunch
of
keys
that
she
passed
quickly
by
them
into
the
cell
and
drew
the
prison
door
so
forcibly
that
it
closed
upon
her
with
a
dismal
cry
of
pain
then
the
two
laotians
stated
that
on
the
night
of
the
they
were
awakened
by
the
slamming
of
the
cell
door
and
on
looking
in
the
darkness
towards
the
bed
on
which
the
princess
slept
they
saw
a
figure
sitting
on
it
on
which
they
lit
the
lamp
and
found
it
was
not
their
mistress
but
a
dumb
in
her
place
and
that
they
instinctively
shrank
away
from
her
in
fear
and
horror
lest
she
should
metamorphose
them
also
into
some
unnatural
beings
as
for
the
amazons
it
could
readily
be
seen
that
their
imaginations
had
been
so
vividly
impressed
that
they
were
prepared
to
swear
solemnly
to
their
having
seen
a
supernatural
being
twice
the
size
and
altogether
unlike
the
deaf
and
dumb
creature
before
them
the
unnatural
light
of
pain
or
madness
or
frenzy
or
whatever
it
was
burned
still
more
brightly
in
eyes
her
dress
seemed
to
be
stained
here
and
there
with
darker
spots
as
if
of
blood
and
her
face
grew
more
and
more
colorless
every
moment
but
to
all
the
numberless
questions
put
to
her
by
every
one
of
the
crafty
wizards
and
witches
she
returned
no
reply
her
lips
were
of
an
ashy
whiteness
and
they
really
seemed
to
have
been
closed
by
a
supernatural
power
i
recalled
her
volubility
of
speech
when
i
first
met
her
and
her
impassioned
song
by
which
she
won
for
her
mistress
the
acknowledgment
of
a
deep
and
undying
love
and
i
asked
myself
the
question
over
and
over
again
is
it
possible
that
she
can
be
acting
at
a
signal
an
was
struck
and
so
suddenly
and
immediately
behind
her
that
the
whole
assembly
started
and
taken
by
surprise
turned
to
see
whence
the
sound
came
now
shouted
the
wily
judges
it
is
plain
that
you
can
speak
for
you
are
not
deaf
no
sooner
was
this
said
than
the
feeling
against
the
accused
ran
high
on
account
of
her
obstinacy
and
she
was
forthwith
condemned
to
all
the
tortures
of
the
rack
but
the
humane
yogi
on
hearing
this
raised
his
bare
arms
on
high
and
uttered
the
wild
cry
of
yah
forbear
so
commandingly
that
it
rang
through
the
temple
and
arrested
the
cruel
process
he
then
turned
to
the
poor
girl
and
placing
his
huge
bony
hands
upon
her
shoulders
tenderly
whispered
in
her
ear
something
which
seemed
to
move
the
prisoner
for
she
raised
her
burning
eyes
now
filled
with
tears
to
his
face
and
shaking
her
head
solemnly
and
sadly
to
and
fro
laid
her
finger
on
her
mouth
to
indicate
that
she
could
not
speak
a
tender
light
kindled
the
dark
face
of
the
yogi
as
he
informed
the
assembly
that
the
woman
was
not
a
witch
nor
even
obstinate
but
powerless
to
speak
because
under
the
influence
of
witchcraft
the
tide
of
feeling
was
again
turned
in
the
prisoner
favor
let
her
be
exorcised
said
the
chief
judge
of
the
supreme
court
whose
secretary
was
making
minutes
of
all
that
took
place
during
the
trial
on
which
the
woman
of
the
party
an
old
and
toothless
dame
drew
out
a
key
from
her
girdle
and
opened
the
wooden
boxes
from
which
she
took
a
small
boat
a
sort
of
coracle
such
as
are
still
found
in
some
parts
of
wales
made
by
covering
a
wicker
frame
with
leather
a
long
gray
veil
of
singular
texture
an
earthen
stove
whereon
to
kindle
a
charcoal
fire
and
some
charcoal
out
of
the
second
box
she
produced
some
herbs
pieces
of
flint
cast
skins
of
snakes
feathers
the
hair
of
various
animals
with
dead
men
bones
short
brooms
and
a
host
of
other
queer
things
at
any
other
time
i
should
have
been
highly
amused
at
the
grotesqueness
of
the
figure
and
the
comically
ludicrous
manner
in
which
she
drew
one
after
another
her
mysterious
ingredients
out
of
her
boxes
but
now
i
was
too
anxious
and
too
much
pained
by
the
situation
of
and
by
what
seemed
to
me
diabolical
jugglery
to
think
of
the
comical
side
of
the
scene
with
the
charcoal
the
old
woman
proceeded
to
light
a
fire
in
her
earthen
stove
when
it
was
she
opened
several
jars
of
water
and
muttering
some
strange
incantations
threw
into
them
portions
of
her
herbs
repeating
over
each
a
mystic
spell
and
waving
a
curious
wand
which
looked
like
a
human
bone
and
might
have
been
once
the
arm
of
a
stalwart
man
this
done
she
seated
the
prisoner
in
the
centre
of
the
motley
group
covered
her
over
with
the
veil
of
gray
stuff
and
handing
the
short
to
a
number
of
her
set
she
to
my
intense
horror
began
to
pour
the
burning
charcoal
over
the
veiled
form
of
the
prisoner
which
the
other
women
dancing
around
and
repeating
with
the
wildest
gestures
the
name
of
brahma
as
rapidly
swept
off
this
was
done
without
even
singeing
the
veil
or
burning
a
hair
of
head
after
this
they
emptied
the
jars
of
water
upon
her
still
repeating
the
name
of
brahma
she
was
then
made
to
change
her
clothes
for
an
entirely
new
dress
of
the
brahminical
fashion
her
dressing
and
undressing
were
effected
with
great
skill
without
disclosing
her
person
in
the
least
and
once
more
the
yogi
laid
his
hands
upon
her
shoulders
and
whispered
again
in
her
ears
first
the
right
and
then
the
left
but
returned
the
same
intimation
shaking
her
head
and
pointing
to
her
sealed
lips
then
the
old
wizard
khoon
literally
the
lord
who
drives
out
the
devil
prostrated
himself
before
her
and
prayed
with
a
wild
energy
of
manner
and
rising
suddenly
he
peremptorily
demanded
looking
full
into
the
prisoner
face
where
did
you
drop
the
bunch
of
keys
the
glaring
daylight
illuminated
with
a
pale
lustre
the
fine
face
of
the
laotian
slave
as
for
the
third
time
she
moved
her
head
in
solemn
intimation
that
she
could
not
or
would
not
speak
to
see
her
thus
no
one
would
believe
but
that
if
she
willed
she
could
speak
at
once
open
her
mouth
and
pour
some
of
the
magic
water
into
it
suggested
one
of
the
wise
women
but
they
who
opened
her
mouth
fell
back
with
horror
and
cried
brahma
brahma
an
evil
fiend
has
torn
out
her
tongue
and
immediately
the
unhappy
woman
passed
from
being
an
object
of
fear
and
dread
to
one
of
tender
commiseration
of
pity
and
even
of
adoration
so
sudden
was
the
transition
from
fear
and
hate
to
love
and
pity
that
many
of
the
strong
men
and
women
wept
outright
at
the
thought
of
the
dreadful
mutilation
that
the
fiend
had
subjected
her
to
now
came
the
last
and
most
important
question
was
the
exorcism
effectual
to
prove
which
a
small
taper
was
lighted
and
put
into
the
witches
boat
and
the
whole
company
betook
themselves
to
the
borders
of
the
stream
to
see
it
launched
the
boat
swept
gallantly
down
the
waters
and
the
feeble
lamp
burned
brightly
without
even
a
flicker
for
it
was
a
calm
day
till
it
was
brought
to
a
stand
by
some
stones
that
were
strewn
across
the
stream
then
the
yogi
raised
a
shout
of
wild
delight
and
all
the
company
it
with
intense
satisfaction
and
pleasure
and
in
accordance
with
the
king
instructions
being
fully
acquitted
of
any
complicity
with
the
devil
in
the
abduction
of
the
princess
the
prisoners
received
each
a
sum
of
money
and
were
set
at
liberty
the
planks
which
in
any
other
court
would
have
been
one
of
the
most
tangible
evidences
that
some
person
had
thereby
scaled
the
palace
walls
were
never
even
thought
of
during
this
singular
trial
so
irrational
and
so
superstitious
is
the
native
character
that
they
preferred
to
believe
in
the
supernatural
rather
than
in
any
rational
cause
for
the
disappearance
of
the
princess
and
for
once
in
my
life
i
was
led
to
rejoice
in
their
ignorance
it
was
sunset
before
this
inconceivably
grotesque
and
and
deluding
set
of
maniacs
dispersed
the
yogi
went
back
to
the
solitude
of
his
unknown
cave
to
sleep
by
day
and
pray
alone
by
night
and
i
sent
my
syce
home
and
remained
behind
under
a
to
which
my
pony
was
tied
in
the
hope
of
getting
an
opportunity
of
speaking
alone
with
the
women
who
still
lingered
with
in
the
hall
when
at
length
saw
me
she
rushed
into
my
arms
and
laid
her
head
upon
my
shoulder
uttering
the
most
doleful
and
piteous
of
cries
they
were
not
cries
of
sorrow
but
of
the
wildest
joy
i
embraced
her
with
something
of
the
tenderness
and
sorrow
with
which
a
mother
takes
a
brave
but
reckless
child
to
her
heart
friends
then
told
me
what
i
had
all
along
surmised
that
it
was
she
who
scaled
the
walls
by
means
of
the
two
planks
terrified
the
amazons
opened
the
prison
doors
with
the
keys
she
had
provided
and
led
her
mistress
forcibly
out
after
assisting
her
to
climb
the
walls
on
the
inner
side
she
sat
on
the
top
of
the
outer
wall
until
she
saw
her
safely
on
the
other
side
she
then
dropped
the
keys
to
her
to
be
flung
into
the
river
here
the
prince
and
his
two
friends
received
the
princess
and
led
her
to
a
small
craft
that
was
ready
to
convey
them
to
maulmain
in
vain
they
entreated
to
come
down
from
the
wall
and
join
their
flight
she
resolutely
refused
to
leave
the
companions
of
her
beloved
mistress
in
peril
and
full
of
dread
lest
by
the
dreadful
torture
which
she
knew
awaited
her
she
might
be
forced
to
betray
those
who
were
dearer
to
her
than
her
own
life
she
with
one
stroke
of
her
sharp
dagger
deprived
herself
forever
of
the
power
of
uttering
a
single
intelligible
sound
o
but
why
did
you
not
all
go
off
with
the
princess
i
inquired
because
we
were
too
many
and
we
should
have
only
delayed
and
perhaps
imperilled
the
success
of
the
enterprise
said
the
women
and
had
promised
not
to
leave
us
to
bear
the
penalty
of
her
doings
it
was
difficult
to
tear
myself
away
from
her
i
was
at
once
proud
to
be
loved
by
her
and
to
think
that
she
would
never
speak
again
but
at
length
we
parted
and
she
raising
her
hands
high
above
her
head
waved
them
to
and
fro
and
smiled
a
joyful
adieu
in
spite
of
the
pain
she
still
suffered
from
her
cruel
mutilation
they
took
the
way
to
the
river
to
hire
a
boat
for
pak
laut
whence
they
were
to
sail
to
maulmain
to
join
the
fugitive
prince
and
princess
assuredly
so
long
as
men
and
women
shall
hold
dear
human
courage
and
devotion
in
what
they
believe
to
be
a
just
cause
so
long
will
the
memory
of
this
brave
and
be
cherished

with

at

situated

my

hunter
was
a
native
of

but
of
portuguese
parentage
her
husband
robert
hunter
was
private
secretary
to
the
supreme
king
she
had
two
sons
who
had
been
taken
away
from
her
in
their
infancy
by
their
protestant
father
lest
they
should
be
brought
up
in
the
roman
catholic
faith
and
shipped
off
secretly
to
scotland
in
order
that
they
might
be
educated
under
the
influences
of
the
free
church
of
scotland
in
which
he
had
himself
been
brought
up
this
occasioned

between
the
husband
and
wife
which
led
to
their
ultimate
separation
and
rosa
returned
all
but
to
the
home
of
her
childhood
where
i
visited
her
at
short
intervals
to
write
the
long
loving
letters
which
she
dictated
to
me
in
siamese
and
which
i
wrote
in
english
to
her
absent
boys
a
day
at
her
house
was
always
a
pleasant
change
on
one
of
these
visits
which
i
remember
well
the
table
had
been
spread
by
the
window
that
looked
up
the
river
and
lost
it
amid
high
banks
and
the
projecting
spires
of
the
roman
catholic
and
the
buddhist
temples
adjoining
i
had
finished
and
sealed
her
loving
messages
to
her
absent
children
the
moon
was
rising
and
we
needed
no
other
light
as
the
conversation
between
us
often
shifting
and
often
pausing
had
gradually
become
grave
and
we
fell
into
confiding
talk
of
what
we
hoped
and
what
we
feared
as
we
saw
the
future
of
our
children
stretched
before
us
in
deep
shadows
there
is
so
much
power
in
faith
said
rosa
even
in
relation
to
earthly
things
that
i
am
surprised
you
are
not
a
roman
catholic
i
believe
in
my
church
when
i
go
to
confession
and
receive
the
holy
communion
i
am
filled
with
peace
and
trust
and
have
no
fears
for
the
future
there
is
a
great
deal
in
what
you
say
rosa
i
replied
but
i
am
afraid
that
i
should
not
make
a
good
catholic
since
i
am
disposed
to
question
everything
that
does
not
accord
with
my
own
perceptions
of
the
right
and
the
true
well
i
suppose
said
rosa
that
our
natures
differ
all
my
life
has
its
roots
in
the
roman
catholic
church
i
never
doubt
therefore
i
never
question
the
holy
virgin
and
her
son
are
sufficient
for
me
and
the
good
priest
who
absolves
me
from
my
sins
my
only
one
sorrow
is
that
my
children
are
cast
out
of
the
pale
of
salvation
by
the
foolish
prejudices
of
their
father
this
was
said
in
a
voice
of
much
feeling
and
tears
gathered
to
her
eyes
i
moved
to
her
side
and
tried
to
comfort
her
by
saying
after
all
rosa
you
seem
to
let
your
fears
for
your
children
cloud
your
faith
in
that
saviour
who
died
for
them
as
well
as
for
you
while
i
was
speaking
my
eyes
fell
upon
a
long
narrow
canoe
called
by
the
natives
rua
keng
in
which
was
seated
a
tall
slender
and
shapely
young
girl
who
was
slowly
with
the
aid
of
two
short
paddles
making
her
way
towards
us
through
the
water
while
her
face
was
raised
to
the
moonlight
that
fell
brightly
upon
her
it
was
nearly
high
tide
a
fleet
of
canoes
boats
and
barges
was
moving
in
all
directions
over
the
broad
waters
we
watched
the
girl
as
her
paddles
rose
and
fell
softly
and
slowly
by
the
moonlight
now
dipping
into
the
water
now
rising
above
it
like
the
white
wings
of
some
lazy
bird
nearer
and
nearer
came
the
long
boat
and
clearer
shone
the
fair
face
that
was
still
uplifted
and
reflected
back
the
moonlight
till
it
almost
looked
as
if
divinely
inspired
it
is
impossible
to
do
any
kind
of
justice
to
this
beautiful
moonlight
picture
gently
the
boat
shot
under
our
window
and
was
lost
to
our
sight
i
bade
my
friend
adieu
and
hastened
to
the
pier
where
i
met
the
girl
again
she
had
fastened
her
canoe
to
one
of
the
posts
that
supported
the
quay
and
was
crossing
the
street
in
one
hand
she
held
a
bunch
of
lilies
and
in
the
other
a
vase
full
of
flowers
yielding
to
the
impulse
of
the
moment
instead
of
stepping
into
my
boat
i
took
my
boy
hand
and
followed
her
graceful
figure
it
was
not
yet
seven
a
number
of
people
were
in
the
squalid
dirty
streets
of
tâmsèng
the
twinkling
evening
lights
were
stealing
out
one
by
one
and
the
girl
drew
over
her
face
a
veil
or
covering
which
was
attached
to
her
hair
by
a
large
and
beautiful
pin
a
dozen
or
more
steps
and
we
stood
in
the
porch
of
the
roman
catholic
chapel
dedicated
to
tomas
the
saint
lights
were
burning
on
the
altar
over
which
were
two
figures
of
the
christ
one
suspended
above
it
with
a
crown
of
thorns
bleeding
and
nailed
to
the
cross
the
other
of
magnificent
stature
was
enveloped
in
a
costume
as
gorgeous
as
the
coronation
robes
of
an
emperor
the
vestment
being
a
sort
of
indian
brocade
of
woven
gold
arabesqued
with
jewels
and
scented
with
spikenard
a
diadem
lavishly
adorned
with
emeralds
and
diamonds
pressed
its
forehead
in
some
measure
confining
the
hair
which
streamed
down
in
abundant
tresses
upon
the
shoulders
and
mingled
with
a
beard
no
darker
than
the
glossy
hue
of
the
chestnut
on
either
side
of
the
altar
were
two
other
figures
one
of
the
virgin
mother
in
the
same
regal
attire
and
crowned
as
the
queen
of
heaven
while
the
other
was
the
patron
saint
with
a
flowing
beard
and
a
benevolent
face
suspended
over
the
altar
was
a
grand
japanese
lamp
the
priest
a
dark
heavily
built
man
a
native
but
of
portuguese
parentage
was
standing
before
it
with
his
cap
on
his
head
and
his
back
to
the
congregation
the
moment
the
girl
beheld
the
glory
of
the
altar
and
the
lights
that
shot
up
and
quivered
and
were
reflected
in
a
thousand
beautiful
tints
upon
the
magnificent
figure
of
the
christ
she
dropped
on
her
knees
and
held
down
her
head
in
mute
adoration
after
a
little
while
she
rose
and
advancing
a
few
steps
nearer
placed
her
golden
vase
of
flowers
on
the
bare
floor
dropped
on
her
knees
again
and
holding
the
white
lilies
between
her
folded
hands
seemed
absorbed
in
her
devotions
in
her
attitude
and
bearing
there
was
a
depth
of
feeling
which
harmonizing
with
her
beautiful
figure
arrested
the
eye
of
the
observer
and
cast
every
other
object
in
the
shade
i
withdrew
reluctantly
and
returned
to
my
boat
wondering
who
she
could
be
on
my
way
home
i
gathered
from
the
women
at
the
oars
that
she
was
known
by
the
name
of
nang
rungeâh
lady
rungeâh
that
her
parents
were
buddhists
and
cambodians
proprietors
of
a
large
plantation
east
of
tâmsèng
her
father
chow
suah
was
a
distinguished
noble
and
her
mother
a
cambodian
lady
of
high
birth
who
claimed
to
be
descended
from
the
rulers
of
that
ancient
and
almost
unknown
kingdom
and
that
her
only
brother
was
a
buddhist
priest
but
the
nang
rungeâh
had
become
deeply
impressed
with
the
beauty
of
the
christian
religion
and
was
at
this
moment
the
only
candidate
who
had
offered
herself
for
a
number
of
years
for
baptism
into
the
roman
catholic
church
tomas
saint
the
founder
of
the
beautiful
church
around
which
had
grown
up
this
christian
village
was
a
portuguese
gentleman
renowned
for
his
piety
and
his
wealth
he
had
obtained
the
title
of
saint
even
in
his
lifetime
but
the
good
people
fearing
to
arouse
the
jealousy
of
the
apostle
of
christ
after
whom
he
was
named
placed
the
title
after
instead
of
before
his
name
and
out
of
it
had
grown
the
name
of
tâmsèng
on
the
very
next
saturday
following
it
being
the
first
holiday
that
offered
itself
to
me
i
set
out
with
my
boy
very
early
in
the
morning
to
explore
the
village
of
tâmsèng
we
chose
for
our
one
of
the
most
beautiful
buddhist
temples
in
the
neighborhood
the
grounds
and
monasteries
bounded
the
catholic
village
on
the
northeast
side
of
the
river
this
temple
called
adi
buddha
annando
the
first
buddha
or
the
infinite
was
embowered
in
a
grove
of
trees
of
luxuriant
growth
affording
a
delicious
shade
it
must
have
been
in
its
best
days
a
magnificent
building
for
even
now
though
much
of
its
beauty
was
obliterated
it
was
covered
from
its
massive
base
to
its
tapering
summits
with
sculptures
and
frescoed
within
and
without
with
marvellous
effect
so
that
wherever
you
turned
your
eyes
the
impression
of
a
more
subtle
and
a
finer
spirituality
dawned
upon
you
as
it
was
meet
it
should
in
a
temple
dedicated
to
one
whom
the
pious
buddhists
will
never
even
name
so
great
is
their
reverence
for
the
first
or
supreme
intelligence
after
a
simple
breakfast
of
fruit
and
milk
we
strolled
about
the
village
and
its
surroundings
making
notes
and
sketches
of
all
that
could
be
seen
it
was
surprising
to
me
that
it
looked
so
well
in
the
early
sunshine
the
places
that
had
struck
me
as
foul
and
repulsive
in
the
dim
twilight
now
wore
a
different
aspect
as
if
bent
on
looking
their
brightest
and
best
in
acknowledgment
of
the
prodigal
sunlight
but
the
farther
we
penetrated
into
the
heart
of
the
village
the
more
we
were
disappointed
and
my
first
impressions
were
more
than
realized
we
soon
came
upon
scenes
of
the
most
squalid
misery
and
filth
poverty
and
destitution
amid
heaps
of
refuse
and
puddles
of
mud
that
caused
us
to
shrink
aside
with
disgust
it
is
natural
to
demand
that
beautiful
ideas
should
be
clothed
with
beautiful
forms
it
was
therefore
to
me
an
outrage
on
the
name
of
christianity
to
find
that
while
all
around
lay
scenes
of
luxuriant
beauty
which
brightened
the
eye
and
cheered
the
heart
the
only
christian
village
in
the
vicinity
of
bangkok
which
should
have
been
an
embodiment
of
all
that
is
pure
and
lovely
had
been
transformed
by
the
greed
and
oppression
of
the
local
officers
to
a
pestilential
spot
to
fester
and
poison
the
pure
air
of
heaven
some
few
native
christian
women
were
about
milking
their
goats
others
were
seated
on
their
doorsteps
unwashed
and
uncombed
they
seemed
even
to
have
lost
the
virtue
of
personal
cleanliness
which
with
the
indian
covers
a
multitude
of
sins
stray
packs
of
pariah
dogs
and
herds
of
swine
were
barking
and
grunting
in
the
streets
and
all
kinds
of
poultry
were
picking
a
scanty
breakfast
from
the
heaps
of
garbage
every
now
and
then
we
were
compelled
to
cross
a
stagnant
pool
or
a
muddy
gutter
alive
with
insects
i
never
saw
anything
like
the
mud
it
was
a
black
liquid
sticky
slimy
and
yet
hard
hurting
like
hail
when
it
struck
the
flesh
and
now
we
reached
the
quaint
little
chapel
of
tomas
saint
its
glories
were
sadly
obscured
by
wet
and
damp
and
the
painting
and
gilding
on
the
outside
looked
cold
and
dull
a
colored
priest
a
descendant
of
the
renowned
tomas
was
officiating
it
was
some
saint
day
an
assemblage
of
men
women
and
children
was
seated
on
the
floor
some
in
groups
and
some
on
rude
benches
the
priest
bends
over
his
missal
and
pours
forth
in
execrable
latin
the
exquisite
prayers
of
the
church
of
rome
and
all
the
congregation
in
their
silks
and
in
their
rags
and
wretchedness
are
hushed
and
silent
with
bent
heads
and
folded
hands
while
the
sound
of
the
prayers
which
they
do
not
understand
beyond
that
it
is
the
voice
of
prayer
fills
their
unenlightened
but
reverent
hearts
with
mysterious
dread
and
worship
on
quitting
the
chapel
we
were
at
once
beset
by
a
numerous
horde
of
beggars
it
was
not
food
or
money
that
they
craved
but
strange
to
say
it
was
justice
they
followed
us
all
the
way
back
to
the
temple
importuning
me
to
redress
their
wrongs
and
find
a
remedy
for
their
grievances
some
of
the
poor
wretches
were
and
not
a
few
were
crazed
an
elderly
lady
evidently
once
of
superior
rank
came
crawling
up
to
me
and
clasped
my
feet
making
a
painful
noise
in
a
language
that
i
could
not
understand
and
piteously
gesticulating
some
incomprehensible
request
the
people
of
the
place
denied
all
knowledge
of
her
at
last
she
insisted
on
my
giving
her
a
leaf
out
of
my
full
of
writing
which
she
apparently
considered
as
a
charm
for
she
attached
it
to
a
cord
round
her
neck
and
seemed
to
be
perfectly
happy
in
its
possession
god
only
knows
what
the
poor
thing
wanted
to
tell
me
but
likely
enough
her
story
was
one
of
some
great
wrong
of
some
cruel
injustice
if
the
smallest
details
of
what
i
heard
that
day
might
be
credited
the
wrongs
of
these
people
were
of
the
most
harrowing
nature
and
altogether
without
hope
of
remedy
under
the
twofold
and
inveterately
vicious
system
of
siamese
and
administration
that
prevailed
there
i
was
alarmed
when
i
found
that
my
visit
was
thought
to
be
one
secretly
intended
to
spy
out
the
land
in
the
service
of
the
king
of
siam
and
that
i
was
expected
to
wipe
away
the
tears
from
all
eyes
in
vain
i
protested
to
the
contrary
no
one
would
listen
to
me
but
the
crowds
kept
coming
and
going
and
pleading
and
praying
and
promising
me
fabulous
sums
of
money
if
i
would
only
see
their
wrongs
redressed
many
a
tale
was
told
to
me
that
day
with
quivering
lips
and
streaming
eyes
as
i
rested
beneath
the
porch
of
the
temple
of
adi
buddha
annando
by
women
who
had
been
plundered
of
all
they
once
possessed
their
children
sold
into
slavery
or
tortured
to
death
their
habitations
despoiled
merely
because
they
happened
to
have
property
and
presumed
to
live
independently
upon
lands
which
their
more
powerful
neighbors
coveted
the
greater
number
of
these
depredators
were
siamese
of
influence
who
had
enrolled
themselves
as
christians
under
the
french
or
the
portuguese
flags
and
unless
the
sufferer
could
claim
the
protection
of
either
the
one
or
the
other
it
seemed
a
cruel
mockery
to
refer
them
for
redress
to
any
existing
local
authority
so
long
as
visate
a
high
but
unprincipled
roman
catholic
dignitary
was
the
governor
of
this
district
and
the
saddest
part
of
it
all
was
that
the
sufferers
themselves
felt
there
was
no
use
in
applying
for
justice
to
him
in
talking
with
some
buddhist
men
and
women
who
were
land
proprietors
in
the
vicinity
they
told
me
that
they
were
afraid
of
their
christian
brethren
and
would
not
if
they
could
prevent
it
permit
them
to
lease
farms
on
their
estates
why
i
asked
because
if
they
once
get
hold
of
a
house
or
a
farm
they
manage
in
time
to
turn
us
out
but
how
well
they
lease
small
bits
of
land
year
after
year
expend
money
on
it
and
then
when
they
have
a
sufficiently
large
plantation
to
settle
upon
they
refuse
to
pay
rent
go
to
law
and
bring
false
witnesses
to
prove
they
have
purchased
the
land
of
the
owners
while
the
local
authorities
either
take
the
part
of
the
or
imprison
both
parties
until
they
have
squeezed
all
they
can
out
of
them
the
buddhist
does
not
dare
said
they
to
lay
his
hand
upon
the
sacred
tree
and
swear
falsely
because
the
god
who
lives
in
it
sees
all
and
he
dreads
his
vengeance
but
the
christian
may
swear
to
as
many
lies
as
he
pleases
for
the
priests
of
the
jesu
will
give
him
absolution
for
them
where
then
is
the
harm
to
him
i
observed
among
the
crowd
a
highly
respectable
looking
and
handsomely
dressed
woman
who
sat
apart
taking
no
share
in
the
conversation
but
listening
with
apparent
interest
to
all
that
was
said
her
eyes
were
very
dark
and
very
fine
but
filled
with
rather
a
sad
expression
towards
evening
she
rose
to
go
away
but
as
if
on
second
thought
she
turned
to
me
and
greeted
me
in
a
peculiarly
sweet
voice
that
sounded
like
music
to
my
ears
after
all
the
voices
of
the
crowd
inviting
us
to
go
and
take
our
evening
meal
at
her
house
to
which
she
at
once
led
the
way
a
narrow
gravelled
walk
led
to
the
house
situated
in
a
lovely
garden
and
separated
by
a
wilderness
of
wild
plants
and
from
the
neighboring
christian
village
a
long
veranda
with
stone
steps
led
down
to
the
gravelled
path
just
in
front
stood
an
old
lusty
and
burly
in
the
full
strength
of
its
gnarled
trunk
and
vigorous
long
boughs
and
branches
forming
arched
and
leafy
bowers
all
round
it
the
pathway
ran
through
a
shrubbery
luxuriant
with
oleanders
jessamine
roses
laurel
and
the
indian
myrtle
beneath
these
small
wild
rabbits
had
formed
a
colony
and
it
was
curious
to
see
a
leaf
moved
upwards
mysteriously
a
head
and
ears
protrude
themselves
or
a
tail
and
legs
and
then
disappear
as
suddenly
this
road
ran
to
a
great
distance
behind
the
house
and
led
through
nearly
three
miles
of
ground
laid
out
in
sugar
rice
cocoanut
and
tobacco
plantations
a
small
stream
trickled
through
these
stagnating
here
and
there
into
deep
green
pools
in
passing
near
one
of
these
pools
i
noticed
that
my
hostess
turned
away
her
face
and
in
answer
to
my
questions
she
told
me
that
it
was
once
a
large
tank
but
was
now
called
tâlataie
the
pool
of
death
on
further
inquiry
i
learned
that
this
name
had
been
given
it
from
a
tragic
circumstance
which
had
happened
in
her
family
that
shortly
after
her
eldest
daughter
engagement
to
a
young
siamese
christian
the
betrothed
pair
went
out
for
a
ramble
along
the
banks
of
the
streamlet
night
descended
and
the
shadows
deepened
into
midnight
but
her
daughter
and
her
lover
did
not
return
at
length
her
fears
were
aroused
and
the
whole
household
set
out
with
lanterns
to
search
the
grounds
but
nowhere
could
they
find
a
trace
of
the
absent
couple
until
morning
dawned
upon
their
fruitless
search
when
her
daughter
was
found
lying
on
her
face
in
the
dark
pool
stripped
of
all
the
beautiful
jewels
in
which
she
had
arrayed
herself
on
the
previous
evening
and
her
christian
lover
was
never
seen
or
heard
of
again
but
her
spirit
still
haunts
the
spot
said
the
sad
mother
to
me
and
on
moonlight
nights
i
see
her
pale
form
floating
in
the
pool
and
crying
to
us
for
help
the
lady
then
wiped
away
her
tears
with
her
black
hom
or
scarf
and
led
us
into
the
house
her
husband
a
much
older
and
more
person
now
appeared
and
the
slaves
brought
us
a
great
many
delicacies
on
silver
trays
while
we
partook
of
them
our
hostess
asked
me
a
number
of
questions
about
my
home
friends
children
and
relatives
she
then
informed
me
that
her
family
now
consisted
of
one
son
and
a
daughter
and
that
the
former
was
a
buddhist
priest
serving
in
the
very
temple
where
she
had
met
me
where
is
your
daughter
now
i
inquired
she
pointed
to
a
window
which
opened
into
an
inner
chamber
i
looked
in
and
to
my
glad
surprise
saw
seated
on
a
low
stool
holding
an
open
book
in
which
she
seemed
wholly
absorbed
the
same
girl
who
had
so
attracted
me
on
the
sunday
evening
previous
her
face
was
very
fine
and
seemingly
full
of
spiritual
beauty
and
her
figure
surpassingly
beautiful
while
we
stood
gazing
at
her
some
sudden
and
apparently
painful
emotion
flitted
rapidly
across
her
face
as
she
read
in
the
book
like
the
shadow
of
a
dark
cloud
over
the
quiet
water
the
mother
was
silent
evidently
making
an
effort
to
master
the
feelings
which
this
sight
occasioned
in
her
breast
so
as
to
speak
calmly
about
it
i
sat
down
again
and
inquired
the
name
of
the
book
in
which
her
daughter
was
so
absorbed
it
is
a
book
called
beeble
said
the
woman
what
kind
of
a
book
is
it
i
assured
her
that
it
was
a
very
good
book
the
book
above
all
others
ever
printed
that
her
daughter
did
well
to
read
it
and
that
it
would
help
to
develop
her
into
a
lovely
and
beautiful
character
i
then
left
my
kind
hostess
satisfied
and
yet
saddened
by
my
trip

nang
rungeah
the
cambodian
proselyte
tâmsèng
presented
a
picture
of
the
sea
at
the
moment
when
the
tide
is
on
the
turn
there
is
always
a
lull
and
sometimes
a
profound
calm
before
the
mighty
currents
shift
and
set
in
another
direction
the
eager
child
who
is
piling
up
castles
of
sand
one
upon
another
on
its
shores
pauses
in
wonder
and
astonishment
at
the
sight
that
strong
angel
the
tide
that
he
had
watched
in
breathless
delight
advancing
resistlessly
ever
onward
nearer
and
nearer
rushing
on
to
kiss
with
its
foaming
mouth
his
wayward
feet
then
rolling
back
and
laughing
from
its
lips
the
audacious
brine
is
suddenly
arrested
the
dull
surging
roar
that
filled
his
ear
as
if
it
were
the
voice
of
some
mysterious
is
hushed
the
great
sea
has
become
silent
and
still
and
the
strong
angel
has
expired
his
last
faint
effort
and
his
feeble
dying
moan
fall
upon
the
child
attentive
eye
and
listening
ear
like
a
for
he
has
been
told
that
this
tide
keeps
the
salt
sea
fresh
and
its
shores
healthful
he
sets
up
a
shout
of
despair
and
prays
the
strong
angel
to
return
and
trouble
again
the
still
waters
to
renew
the
life
which
has
passed
away
and
prevent
that
of
stagnation
that
must
bring
with
it
mortal
disease
to
the
earth
religions
have
their
tides
as
well
as
the
ocean
and
all
life
has
its
grand
cyclical
currents
whether
in
the
church
the
state
the
individual
or
the
nation
thus
this
little
village
of
tâmsèng
seemed
long
since
to
have
arrived
at
the
period
of
that
reaction
which
marks
the
disappearance
of
the
tide
from
the
sea
and
the
influx
of
that
sluggish
insensibility
which
foretells
the
beginning
of
the
stagnation
which
if
not
removed
must
inevitably
end
in
mortification
and
death
but
now
after
the
torpor
of
nearly
half
a
century
and
through
the
stagnation
of
the
decaying
village
there
is
heard
a
voice
of
general
rejoicing
the
main
features
of
the
place
undergo
a
slight
change
a
gentle
flow
of
life
stirs
its
visage
a
beautiful
and
wealthy
cambodian
heiress
the
lady
nang
rungeah
is
a
candidate
for
baptism
in
the
roman
catholic
church
on
the
of
june
it
being
the
morning
of
her
first
confessional
the
bells
are
set
in
motion
and
ring
all
day
till
sunset
as
is
the
custom
for
a
new
convert
resounding
in
the
glens
and
hollows
and
amid
the
spires
of
the
buddhist
and
roman
catholic
temples
the
chamber
into
which
i
had
looked
at
a
young
girl
reading
with
her
heart
and
eyes
a
copy
of
the
new
testament
translated
not
by
a
roman
catholic
but
by
an
american
presbyterian
missionary
the
rev
mattoon
is
now
the
centre
of
a
most
animated
scene
khoon
and
his
wife
jethamas
are
seated
in
the
little
room
in
earnest
conversation
they
are
interrupted
by
their
daughter
rungeah
who
comes
quietly
in
throws
her
arms
around
her
mother
kneels
before
her
and
lays
her
head
in
her
lap
the
mother
folds
her
arms
tenderly
around
her
child
and
caresses
her
lovingly
smoothing
her
soft
hair
ah
rungeah
art
thou
dressed
already
thou
dost
not
need
much
adornment
and
the
old
man
eyes
brightened
with
pride
and
love
as
they
lighted
on
the
pleasant
beauty
and
the
graceful
proportions
of
his
daughter
nang
rungeah
the
bright
was
indeed
pleasant
to
look
upon
hers
was
the
half
indian
and
half
cambodian
beauty
so
rare
in
siam
the
large
long
drooping
eye
round
oval
face
and
clear
complexion
with
a
touch
of
healthful
ruddiness
in
her
cheeks
hair
soft
and
rich
falling
loosely
in
long
curls
over
her
shoulders
the
charms
of
her
face
and
feature
however
were
as
naught
to
the
brightness
and
kindliness
that
played
over
them
like
a
sunny
gleam
her
figure
was
remarkable
tall
and
lithe
yet
perfectly
rounded
and
swelling
fairly
beneath
the
graceful
bodice
and
the
full
skirt
that
fell
in
soft
folds
to
her
sandalled
feet
the
pin
by
which
her
veil
was
fastened
was
set
off
with
a
number
of
brilliants
her
arms
were
ornamented
with
gold
bangles
and
on
her
neck
she
wore
a
new
chain
a
gift
from
her
sad
and
loving
mother
a
rosary
of
gold
and
black
coral
beads
to
which
was
attached
a
massive
gold
figure
of
the
christ
on
the
cross
alas
my
child
said
the
mother
at
length
i
pray
buddh
the
chow
that
no
harm
will
come
to
thee
through
this
new
religion
i
wonder
to
hear
you
speak
thus
dear
mother
replied
the
young
girl
lifting
her
eyes
reproachfully
to
her
mother
face
o
i
wish
you
could
be
brought
to
see
how
much
more
beautiful
this
religion
of
jesu
is
than
that
of
buddha
and
then
think
of
the
beautiful
his
holy
mother
who
is
ever
at
his
side
ready
to
whisper
words
of
tender
love
and
pity
in
behalf
of
such
poor
sinners
as
we
are
i
feel
as
if
i
should
never
go
astray
or
do
any
evil
thing
now
that
i
have
the
good
priest
to
pray
for
me
and
the
holy
mother
and
her
son
to
be
my
gods
buddha
forbid
that
i
should
mistrust
your
gods
my
child
but
i
do
mistrust
the
priests
and
my
own
heart
said
the
anxious
mother
in
spite
of
her
love
and
her
faith
rungeah
cheek
grew
pale
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
as
she
reached
the
chapel
of
tâmsèng
with
a
palpitating
heart
she
knelt
at
the
waiting
for
the
priest
to
take
his
place
within
and
open
the
small
window
through
which
he
heard
the
confessions
of
the
congregation
she
hears
a
footstep
on
the
other
side
the
priest
enters
he
shuts
the
door
upon
himself
and
takes
his
place
he
then
pulls
a
cord
which
opens
the
little
window
of
the
and
shuts
at
the
same
time
the
door
which
she
had
left
ajar
as
she
came
into
the
chamber
the
confessional
window
is
open
and
the
priest
coughs
a
slight
cough
but
rungeah
kneels
there
with
her
heart
beating
and
her
hands
folded
gazing
on
that
ideal
and
perfect
manhood
who
has
given
up
his
life
to
save
hers
after
a
long
interval
of
silence
the
voice
of
the
priest
breaks
upon
her
ear
like
the
boom
of
a
cannon
amid
a
garden
of
flowers
my
daughter
said
the
voice
confess
your
sins
my
father
replies
rungeah
her
love
and
joy
breathing
from
her
heart
and
struggling
for
utterance
on
her
lips
whenever
i
think
of
him
his
goodness
and
his
love
of
which
i
never
tire
reading
i
am
filled
with
gladness
and
praise
i
am
now
never
weary
never
cast
down
never
afflicted
nor
does
my
heart
or
my
pulse
ever
fail
me
in
loving
and
adoring
him
my
daughter
interrupted
the
priest
suddenly
this
is
not
confession
you
must
tell
me
of
your
secret
sins
the
guilty
thoughts
words
and
acts
you
have
cherished
spoken
or
committed
when
you
were
still
a
believer
in
the
false
and
horrible
doctrines
of
the
buddha
a
deep
flush
of
pride
which
the
girl
herself
does
not
quite
understand
overspreads
her
beautiful
face
and
her
lips
still
quivering
remain
parted
in
surprise
her
secret
sins
and
guilty
thoughts
why
blame
her
for
not
remembering
them
she
was
as
pure
as
the
upon
the
she
turned
her
thoughts
upon
herself
and
tried
to
recall
some
sin
she
would
have
given
the
world
to
find
some
grave
fault
which
she
could
justly
own
as
hers
to
pour
into
the
ears
of
the
impatient
priest
but
she
could
not
recall
a
single
one
my
memory
is
treacherous
good
father
said
she
i
can
not
now
recall
any
one
of
my
sins
in
particular
though
i
must
have
done
many
many
wrong
things
unless
indeed
it
is
the
one
i
have
committed
in
forsaking
my
dear
old
god
buddha
whom
i
did
truly
love
and
reverence
until
i
heard
and
read
of
the
beautiful
jesu
this
is
not
satisfactory
said
the
priest
dryly
you
will
have
to
do
penance
for
such
thoughts
as
these
and
where
did
you
read
of
jesu
ah
said
the
girl
i
have
a
beautiful
book
which
tells
me
all
about
him
but
who
gave
it
to
you
persisted
the
priest
i
found
it
in
the
temple
of
adi
buddha
annando
where
it
was
left
for
my
brother
by
an
american
priest
the
priest
of
tâmsèng
turned
uneasily
in
his
seat
and
coughed
a
low
cough
preparatory
to
what
he
was
going
to
say
my
daughter
said
he
at
length
in
a
voice
of
grave
reproof
this
last
is
a
dreadful
sin
that
book
is
dangerous
and
those
american
priests
are
our
enemies
they
lie
in
wait
to
deceive
the
children
of
the
true
church
they
deny
the
divinity
of
the
holy
mother
of
god
and
they
go
about
the
country
preaching
their
false
doctrines
and
giving
away
their
books
only
to
delude
the
natives
be
sure
that
you
never
listen
to
them
and
that
you
abstain
from
looking
into
that
book
again
bring
the
book
to
me
and
you
will
be
saved
from
this
great
temptation
the
girl
listened
abashed
hanging
down
her
head
and
with
tears
of
repentance
in
her
eyes
he
then
proceeded
to
state
the
penance
she
would
have
to
perform
to
repeat
fifty
walk
on
the
following
sabbath
morning
barefooted
and
dressed
in
her
meanest
garb
to
the
chapel
of
tâmsèng
and
be
admitted
thus
by
baptism
into
the
true
church
the
priest
again
pulled
the
cord
the
window
was
shut
the
door
stood
ajar
and
the
girl
rose
and
passed
out
to
join
her
attendants
her
bright
face
was
overcast
unbidden
tears
were
in
her
eyes
and
all
her
love
and
joy
in
the
beautiful
saviour
she
had
found
blighted
like
autumn
leaves
before
the
wind
when
she
gained
her
boat
great
black
clouds
lowered
in
the
sky
the
winds
rose
into
a
squall
and
the
waves
tossed
and
tumbled
and
rolled
high
upon
the
banks
it
was
one
of
those
sudden
hurricanes
that
are
so
common
in
siam
the
boat
proved
unmanageable
and
in
spite
of
all
the
combined
efforts
of
the
three
women
she
was
capsized
in
the
middle
of
the
angry
surging
waters
long
and
desperately
the
women
struggle
for
life
again
and
again
they
try
to
swim
towards
the
bank
but
the
stronger
waters
carry
them
away
in
their
irresistible
grasp
the
of
the
temple
of
adi
buddha
annando
has
taken
shelter
beneath
the
porch
of
his
temple
he
sees
the
empty
boat
and
the
struggling
women
he
hesitates
his
vows
forbid
him
to
touch
a
woman
even
his
own
mother
and
still
hold
his
office
as
a
priest
of
buddha
he
sees
the
women
throw
up
their
arms
as
if
imploring
his
aid
he
casts
aside
his
upper
yellow
robe
and
plunges
in
to
their
rescue
regardless
of
his
vows
his
office
of
everything
else
and
now
a
sudden
dizziness
veils
the
eyes
of
the
nang
rungeah
while
her
companions
are
safe
on
the
bank
she
relaxes
her
efforts
a
sickness
like
that
of
death
overcomes
her
and
she
sinks
but
again
the
strong
man
plunges
and
dives
deeper
and
deeper
and
at
last
holds
her
firmly
in
his
herculean
arms
she
hears
or
she
thinks
she
hears
the
voice
of
the
priest
reproving
her
and
the
jubilant
chimes
of
tâmsèng
clang
at
her
fainting
heart
as
she
is
home
out
of
the
dark
waters
and
laid
upon
the
flowery
bank
but
at
length
she
opens
her
eyes
on
maha
sâp
the
chief
priest
of
the
temple
of
adi
buddha
annando
her
brother
tutor
and
guide
a
slight
shudder
and
then
a
blush
of
shame
passes
over
her
as
she
recognizes
her
early
religious
teacher
but
he
stooping
gathers
a
handful
of
flowers
hands
them
to
her
and
says
sadly
and
heavily
did
my
heart
ache
to
see
thee
in
the
grasp
of
the
strong
demons
of
the
storm
and
to
save
thee
i
have
violated
the
vows
of
my
order
but
if
thou
wilt
return
to
me
one
of
these
flowers
as
a
token
i
will
neither
regret
the
loss
of
my
sanctity
nor
yet
of
my
priestly
office
but
rejoice
in
the
fates
that
have
blessed
me
with
a
new
life
to
the
sonorous
rushing
and
wild
dash
of
the
waters
is
joined
the
deep
melodious
voice
of
the
priest
urging
her
to
give
him
a
token
from
his
flowers
and
the
chimes
now
seem
to
swell
into
joyful
choruses
of
jubilant
anthems
as
she
gives
him
the
sweet
token
after
the
fury
of
the
storm
had
abated
the
priest
left
them
and
set
off
to
confess
himself
to
the
archbishop
of
the
ecclesiastical
court
and
the
women
returned
home
the
first
thing
nang
rungeah
did
was
to
relate
to
her
mother
all
that
had
befallen
her
from
the
time
she
entered
the
chapel
of
tâmsèng
to
her
return
home
she
then
took
the
dangerous
book
from
under
her
pillow
and
laid
it
on
a
high
shelf
out
of
her
reach
but
put
in
its
place
her
crumpled
flowers
then
she
knelt
down
and
repeated
her
fifty
with
lessening
fervor
and
tried
to
believe
that
she
was
a
better
woman
but
how
was
it
that
her
thoughts
would
stray
from
the
morrow
bright
vision
when
she
would
publicly
be
baptized
into
the
church
of
christ
to
the
dark
face
of
maha
sâp
and
the
tenderness
she
had
seen
in
his
eyes
she
shut
herself
up
in
her
chamber
to
weep
and
pray
in
agonizing
doubts
and
fears
because
of
that
something
which
has
come
between
her
and
her
beautiful
jesu
chapter
xxviii
ad
ogni
uccello
suo
nido
è
bello
to
every
bird
its
own
nest
is
charming
when
rungeah
awoke
on
the
following
morning
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
just
thrown
off
some
wondrous
and
powerful
spell
that
had
somehow
girt
its
strong
and
mysterious
illusions
about
her
heart
a
new
soul
from
within
that
inmost
chamber
had
started
into
life
she
faltered
hesitated
and
dropped
on
her
knees
and
raised
her
eyes
towards
heaven
and
felt
as
she
had
never
done
before
in
her
visions
strange
contradiction
of
human
nature
and
in
her
holiest
thoughts
of
the
beloved
mother
and
her
son
the
face
of
the
priest
of
buddha
would
intrude
her
prayers
finished
she
put
on
her
most
faded
and
meanest
robe
laid
aside
all
her
customary
adornments
and
jewels
save
only
her
veil
and
her
rosary
and
attended
by
a
host
of
fond
relatives
and
slaves
and
among
them
the
priest
her
brother
and
maha
sâp
in
a
layman
dress
went
her
way
barefooted
to
the
chapel
where
she
solemnly
recanted
the
errors
of
buddhism
and
was
baptized
into
the
church
of
christ
again
the
merry
bells
were
rung
and
on
the
dark
face
of
the
priest
of
tâmsèng
might
be
seen
the
slow
wise
smile
that
round
about
his
dusty
forehead
dryly
curled
seemed
half
within
and
half
without
and
full
of
dealings
with
the
world
a
month
after
her
baptism
mariâ
as
rungeah
was
now
named
was
selected
on
account
of
her
great
piety
and
devotion
to
be
one
of
the
female
wardens
of
the
chapel
this
distinction
she
enjoyed
with
six
other
girls
whose
duty
it
was
to
dust
and
sweep
the
chapel
clean
the
lamps
and
the
gold
and
silver
candlesticks
and
to
dress
the
altar
with
fresh
flowers
saturday
was
the
day
appointed
to
mariâ
to
serve
in
the
chapel
and
a
lovely
warden
was
the
gentle
cambodian
girl
she
had
given
up
the
dangerous
book
to
her
father
confessor
but
the
handful
of
crumpled
flowers
still
nestled
under
her
pillow
and
her
secret
preference
for
was
deeply
hidden
in
her
heart
and
yet
it
proved
an
impenetrable
barrier
as
long
as
she
lived
between
her
and
her
confessor
it
was
touching
to
see
this
girl
at
her
duties
in
the
chapel
after
the
floor
had
been
swept
and
the
candlesticks
polished
and
replenished
with
fresh
candles
and
the
flowers
arranged
in
the
vases
in
the
niches
and
the
garlands
hung
over
the
images
of
the
gods
and
the
saints
she
would
kneel
at
the
foot
of
the
sad
christ
after
having
touched
with
her
lips
the
nailed
and
bleeding
feet
praying
to
him
to
make
her
as
noble
and
as
as
himself
and
to
the
tender
mother
to
intercede
for
her
at
the
throne
of
grace
one
saturday
evening
mariâ
having
spent
a
comfortless
day
within
herself
repaired
to
the
chapel
as
usual
attended
only
by
the
to
open
it
for
the
evening
service
she
opened
wide
the
doors
and
sat
herself
down
under
the
cross
there
were
rays
of
comfort
emanating
from
that
figure
nailed
on
it
forever
that
had
now
become
very
precious
to
her
long
after
the
congregation
had
dispersed
she
knelt
on
the
floor
of
the
sanctuary
all
the
religion
of
the
place
and
the
hour
came
over
her
and
a
strange
yearning
sorrow
for
which
she
could
not
account
and
as
she
knelt
there
she
fancied
that
a
shadow
darkened
the
lights
that
streamed
down
from
the
altar
upon
her
but
only
for
a
moment
for
the
next
found
the
shadow
gone
and
tears
gathering
in
her
eyes
alas
what
is
it
that
steals
my
thoughts
from
thee
to
buddha
and
the
temple
in
which
i
once
loved
to
worship
muttered
the
girl
at
her
own
depravity
the
chapel
bell
suddenly
flung
out
the
hour
of
five
ten
she
rose
from
her
knees
put
out
the
lights
and
locking
the
doors
turned
into
the
dark
deserted
street
but
somehow
a
sudden
fear
overcame
her
and
a
feeling
that
somebody
was
watching
her
perhaps
following
her
she
drew
her
veil
over
her
face
and
ran
breathlessly
towards
the
river
where
she
gained
her
boat
and
returned
home
for
the
night
the
roman
catholic
missionary
society
at
bangkok
consisted
of
one
bishop
and
from
fifteen
to
twenty
priests
besides
a
number
of
proselytes
from
the
siamese
and
the
chinese
who
also
were
admitted
into
the
priesthood
of
the
former
most
of
the
priests
were
endowed
with
every
talent
that
a
strict
collegiate
education
could
furnish
but
the
latter
were
particularly
useful
because
besides
being
professing
and
some
of
them
sincere
christians
they
possessed
the
power
of
expounding
the
doctrines
of
the
church
to
their
native
brethren
in
a
language
natural
to
themselves
from
their
birth
nor
was
this
all
they
were
nearly
all
well
skilled
in
medicine
and
surgery
which
gave
them
more
power
than
the
french
priests
in
winning
over
the
discontented
followers
of
the
buddha
to
lend
a
willing
ear
to
the
marvellous
facts
of
the
christian
faith
and
moreover
as
the
teachings
and
ceremonies
of
the
roman
catholic
church
are
in
many
respects
almost
identical
with
the
buddhist
teachings
and
ceremonies
the
roman
catholic
priests
are
more
successful
in
making
proselytes
than
their
protestant
colaborers
in
the
same
field
when
a
poor
ignorant
buddhist
goes
into
his
temples
he
sees
the
images
of
the
buddha
and
he
sees
certain
forms
and
prostrations
practised
the
burning
of
incense
the
bowing
before
the
shrines
and
hears
prayers
uttered
in
an
unknown
tongue
and
he
knows
also
that
the
most
heinous
sin
that
can
be
committed
by
the
buddhist
priest
is
the
violation
of
his
oath
of
celibacy
and
if
from
idle
curiosity
he
should
be
induced
to
enter
a
roman
catholic
chapel
or
church
to
his
surprise
and
delight
he
observes
not
only
forms
and
ceremonies
very
nearly
approaching
to
those
used
in
his
own
temple
but
also
images
and
pictures
far
more
beautiful
and
attractive
than
those
of
his
own
gods
on
inquiring
he
finds
that
the
priests
of
this
faith
also
do
not
marry
that
they
have
the
marvellous
power
to
absolve
the
transgressor
from
the
consequences
of
his
deadly
sins
and
that
the
only
thing
necessary
to
escape
the
irresistible
wheel
of
the
law
is
faith
in
christ
so
the
poor
timorous
trembling
soul
that
feels
a
certain
consciousness
of
a
fearful
retribution
awaiting
his
sins
and
yet
knows
not
where
or
to
whom
to
fly
hails
with
joy
the
name
of
christ
the
sacrifice
as
a
rock
on
which
to
rest
his
weary
wings
and
fears
no
more
the
inexorable
wheel
of
the
divine
vengeance
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
then
that
the
siamese
peguans
and
cambodians
readily
give
ear
to
the
native
catholic
priests
and
particularly
when
even
the
french
and
portuguese
priests
adapt
themselves
in
many
instances
to
the
usages
and
customs
of
the
natives
themselves
the
most
striking
of
which
are
in
employing
the
children
of
the
rich
as
wardens
and
keepers
of
the
churches
and
of
never
wearing
any
covering
on
their
heads
on
the
morning
following
the
night
on
which
mariâ
had
lingered
so
late
in
the
chapel
khoon
jethamas
had
risen
at
daybreak
for
ever
since
the
day
of
the
eventful
she
had
troubled
dreams
accompanied
with
signs
and
omens
that
foretold
approaching
calamity
and
now
she
sat
alone
on
the
doorstep
meditating
sadly
on
the
future
of
her
dear
child
it
had
been
predicted
by
a
wise
old
man
in
the
days
of
infancy
that
she
was
born
under
the
fatal
star
sathimara
who
would
assume
the
form
of
a
fair
and
beautiful
angel
to
lead
her
on
to
her
own
destruction
the
pagan
mother
could
not
discern
between
the
heavenly
and
the
earthly
church
of
christ
nor
between
the
true
and
the
false
ministers
of
the
gospel
and
now
the
prophecy
seemed
in
a
way
of
being
fulfilled
but
like
all
prophecies
in
the
most
manner
suddenly
the
dark
priest
of
tâmsèng
with
a
band
of
officers
appeared
on
the
gravel
walk
the
lady
gave
a
cry
of
alarm
that
brought
nearly
the
whole
household
to
her
side
and
as
the
priest
with
the
officers
persisted
in
forcing
an
immediate
entrance
into
the
house
there
ensued
a
violent
scuffle
between
the
officers
of
the
law
and
the
slaves
of
very
good
said
the
padre
doggedly
it
is
certain
however
that
the
chapel
of
tâmsèng
has
been
plundered
by
mariâ
and
a
vile
pagan
who
was
seen
lurking
in
its
vicinity
last
night
on
hearing
this
the
blood
rushed
violently
to
the
mother
temples
and
she
fell
back
in
a
swoon
and
his
numerous
attendants
were
also
stupefied
by
horror
and
dismay
at
this
dreadful
accusation
and
the
officers
headed
by
the
padre
proceeded
coolly
to
search
the
house
for
the
missing
jewels
and
the
gold
and
silver
candlesticks
censers
and
vases
that
had
ornamented
the
altar
of
the
chapel
of
tâmsèng
at
last
they
reached
mariâ
chamber
she
had
just
risen
and
was
now
on
her
knees
before
the
open
window
the
door
was
burst
open
and
she
turned
still
kneeling
and
holding
her
breath
her
fixed
and
terrified
gaze
upon
the
intruders
the
chapel
and
the
convent
bells
struck
six
it
was
the
hour
when
she
usually
set
out
to
perform
her
small
round
of
sacred
offices
and
to
open
the
church
doors
but
she
had
no
power
to
move
she
saw
the
padre
dash
aside
her
pillow
and
then
her
mattress
and
with
it
her
crumpled
flowers
one
of
the
men
came
towards
her
and
demanded
the
key
of
the
chapel
but
she
could
not
open
her
lips
to
speak
she
knelt
there
petrified
in
the
morning
sunlight
to
think
that
should
have
connived
at
such
an
outrageous
sacrilege
upon
the
altar
of
god
said
the
padre
and
he
ordered
the
men
to
handcuff
her
and
carry
her
away
to
the
prison
at
tâmsèng
she
made
no
resistance
but
let
them
do
whatever
they
wished
with
her
she
seemed
even
to
have
lost
the
power
of
comprehension
she
sees
the
trees
the
thatched
roofs
the
plantations
the
fields
the
tapering
spires
of
the
temple
of
the
infinite
and
a
thousand
small
objects
she
hears
voices
and
cries
that
would
have
escaped
her
at
another
time
as
she
is
dragged
from
the
home
of
her
parents
to
the
prison
cell
of
the
doomed
but
she
can
not
speak
or
cry
or
even
think
where
she
put
the
key
she
knows
that
her
mother
is
seated
outside
of
the
prison
door
wailing
and
crying
and
protesting
that
her
child
is
innocent
of
the
dreadful
crime
of
which
she
is
accused
and
this
is
all
that
is
clear
to
the
stricken
girl
twilight
was
falling
just
as
i
was
coming
out
of
the
palace
for
i
had
been
detained
there
all
day
helping
the
secretary
to
despatch
the
royal
mail
when
khoon
jethamas
came
running
up
to
me
took
both
my
hands
in
hers
and
told
me
the
story
of
her
daughter
imprisonment
what
was
to
be
done
the
woman
was
frantic
with
grief
and
i
was
almost
as
much
confounded
as
she
you
must
come
with
me
dear
lady
this
very
evening
i
can
not
rest
till
i
get
her
out
of
that
dreadful
place
i
at
last
persuaded
her
to
come
to
my
house
and
take
a
cup
of
tea
and
when
i
had
soothed
her
so
that
she
could
make
herself
intelligible
i
thought
the
affair
did
not
look
quite
so
hopeless
as
she
supposed
and
i
tried
to
make
her
take
a
more
cheerful
view
of
the
matter
the
only
thing
that
seemed
strange
was
that
mariâ
could
give
no
account
of
what
she
had
done
with
the
key
of
the
chapel
door
whoever
robbed
the
chapel
had
got
possession
of
the
key
the
locks
on
the
chapel
were
of
european
manufacture
and
there
were
only
two
keys
that
could
open
them
one
in
the
possession
of
the
padre
tomas
and
the
other
in
the
keeping
of
the
young
wardens
who
transferred
it
to
the
next
person
on
duty
after
the
morning
service
in
a
short
time
khoon
jethamas
and
i
were
rowing
against
the
tide
for
the
village
of
tâmsèng
on
the
lady
i
discovered
that
the
late
priest
had
been
seen
prowling
about
the
chapel
when
rungeah
as
the
mother
still
called
her
was
at
her
devotions
and
that
on
the
following
morning
he
was
going
towards
the
same
spot
when
he
was
taken
prisoner
i
confess
that
now
i
began
to
feel
anxious
for
the
value
of
the
jewels
that
were
stolen
was
fixed
at
several
laks
or
millions
of
ticals
an
incredible
sum
which
no
person
could
pay
i
hardly
knew
what
to
think
amid
hopes
and
fears
and
innumerable
plans
which
were
abandoned
as
soon
as
formed
for
new
ones
that
seemed
equally
impracticable
we
reached
the
prison
of
tâmsèng
what
a
dreadful
spot
it
was
in
the
and
the
very
darkness
was
aggravated
by
the
people
around
who
looked
more
savage
and
fiercer
than
wild
beasts
before
and
behind
and
on
all
sides
there
were
rags
and
filth
and
wretchedness
crowding
upon
us
with
the
double
darkness
of
night
and
misery
some
hideous
women
were
jailers
for
a
few
ticals
and
a
promise
not
to
tell
upon
them
they
allowed
us
to
go
in
and
see
the
girl
rungeah
sat
as
one
entranced
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
ground
as
if
she
expected
jesus
or
the
mother
to
rise
up
out
of
it
to
vindicate
her
cause
we
could
not
get
her
to
say
a
word
to
utter
a
cry
or
even
a
moan
we
were
almost
as
much
overwhelmed
at
her
grief
as
she
was
by
the
padre
accusation
what
was
to
be
done
leaving
rungeah
we
set
off
for
the
convent
of
tâmsèng
the
clock
had
long
before
struck
eight
when
we
came
to
the
convent
gate
and
we
were
full
of
hope
but
no
light
was
to
be
seen
and
a
high
wooden
fence
ran
all
round
the
house
groping
our
way
we
came
to
a
gate
at
last
but
it
was
locked
we
began
to
knock
and
we
knocked
loudly
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
then
we
waited
to
see
if
any
one
would
come
to
open
it
no
one
came
we
were
uncertain
what
to
do
the
night
came
on
full
of
clouds
clothing
with
darkness
even
the
depths
the
convent
clock
struck
nine
and
the
thought
of
poor
rungeah
struggling
with
her
anguish
came
with
redoubled
force
upon
the
mother
heart
and
again
we
both
knocked
together
more
and
more
loudly
at
length
lights
appeared
amid
the
gloom
and
three
women
with
lanterns
approached
and
demanded
who
we
were
and
what
we
wanted
on
hearing
that
i
was
a
christian
woman
they
opened
the
gate
and
after
surveying
us
carefully
passing
their
lanterns
up
and
down
our
persons
from
head
to
foot
they
led
the
way
to
the
apartments
of
the
lady
abbess
when
we
entered
we
found
a
old
lady
of
portuguese
descent
seated
on
a
tall
chair
with
nine
or
ten
young
women
mostly
siamese
sewing
scapulars
all
round
the
room
were
dreadful
pictures
of
the
christ
and
the
mother
in
all
kinds
of
agonizing
attitudes
we
proceeded
to
make
our
business
known
which
was
only
to
go
bail
for
rungeah
until
the
trial
should
come
off
and
to
ask
the
influence
with
the
padre
tomas
in
urging
our
request
the
old
lady
coolly
replied
that
it
was
her
duty
to
wait
upon
the
lord
jesus
and
not
to
rush
about
the
country
as
some
folks
did
intermeddling
with
other
people
business
we
left
her
with
clouded
hearts
and
set
out
for
the
house
of
the
padre
as
we
were
women
which
we
in
our
distress
of
mind
had
quite
forgotten
the
servants
or
slaves
of
this
holy
individual
drove
us
from
the
doorstep
with
scorn
and
contemptuous
language
for
our
indelicacy
in
going
there
at
all
we
then
but
less
hopefully
turned
our
almost
fainting
steps
to
the
house
of
the
governor
visate
khoon
jethamas
was
afraid
to
enter
but
i
was
not
going
away
without
seeing
him
i
climbed
the
steps
and
entered
the
veranda
two
slaves
went
before
to
report
our
arrival
i
saw
the
great
man
seated
on
a
cushion
in
a
room
adjoining
with
women
and
men
crouching
in
all
sorts
of
abject
attitudes
before
him
i
walked
in
ready
at
the
mother
request
to
double
and
treble
the
bail
if
necessary
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
approaching
the
governor
rose
retired
to
his
bedchamber
and
shut
the
door
violently
in
my
face
i
came
away
completely
cast
down
and
defeated
as
for
the
poor
mother
she
wrung
her
hands
and
wept
piteously
it
was
now
nearly
eleven
and
we
went
back
to
the
prison
the
unhappy
khoon
jethamas
took
up
her
abode
near
the
only
window
of
the
cell
where
her
daughter
was
immured
i
left
her
sitting
on
a
strip
of
matting
with
her
hands
over
her
face
shutting
out
the
outer
darkness
in
order
to
realize
the
utter
darkness
that
had
fallen
upon
her
life
and
upon
the
light
of
her
home
nights
and
days
succeeded
each
other
in
regular
succession
and
day
after
day
i
went
to
the
prison
to
find
the
patient
loving
mother
living
under
the
shadow
of
its
roof
so
as
to
be
ever
near
her
child
and
once
a
day
she
was
admitted
to
see
her
loved
one
visibly
wasting
away
the
only
change
that
had
taken
place
in
the
prisoner
that
was
hopeful
was
that
now
it
was
she
who
comforted
her
mother
every
day
by
relating
to
her
her
bright
visions
and
assuring
her
that
she
felt
the
time
was
not
far
distant
when
the
mother
and
her
son
would
come
down
from
heaven
to
proclaim
her
innocence
that
the
holy
angels
descended
at
night
to
bless
and
comfort
her
with
loving
promises
of
speedy
justice
and
that
now
the
had
been
transformed
by
them
into
a
paradise
there
are
mysteries
in
all
religions
which
the
uninitiated
can
not
penetrate
and
we
stood
abashed
and
silent
on
the
other
side
of
the
veil
that
was
lifted
for
the
spiritual
consolation
of
this
strange
girl
the
burning
july
sun
shone
daily
on
the
tiled
roof
of
the
prison
of
tâmsèng
the
ground
on
one
side
was
full
of
muddy
pools
and
the
river
on
the
other
was
the
cesspool
of
the
village
a
liquid
mass
of
poison
from
which
rose
the
pestilence
and
the
cholera
that
brooded
with
their
wings
over
the
inhabitants
of
tâmsèng
the
evening
air
was
either
heavy
with
noxious
vapors
or
it
came
in
fitful
burning
gusts
across
the
river
and
brought
no
balm
to
the
suffering
prisoners
within
rungeah
languished
day
after
day
for
the
case
was
to
be
tried
before
the
international
court
of
siam
and
the
days
and
the
weeks
and
the
months
passed
away
like
a
stream
whose
waters
scarcely
seem
to
stray
and
yet
they
glide
like
happiness
away
with
them
poor
rungeah
bright
faith
began
to
grow
dim
and
her
nightly
prayers
to
the
mother
and
her
holy
son
were
less
and
less
hopeful
but
yet
she
still
strove
with
each
returning
day
to
revive
her
drooping
spirits
and
with
sweet
to
paint
elysium
upon
the
darkness
of
her
the
mother
bribed
the
jailers
to
take
to
her
daughter
some
little
delicacies
every
day
for
the
coarse
prison
food
disgusted
the
girl
and
she
was
gradually
being
starved
to
death
and
now
a
low
cough
and
a
hectic
fever
had
set
in
the
judicial
courts
of
siam
one
and
all
included
were
neither
better
nor
worse
than
that
of
other
oriental
and
despotic
kingdoms
and
the
judges
of
the
outer
city
with
the
exception
as
far
as
i
know
of
only
one
man
his
highness
mom
kratai
rajoday
were
very
far
from
being
model
judges
they
aimed
no
higher
than
the
traditional
policy
of
the
empire
the
good
old
rule
that
might
makes
right
which
had
guided
the
rulers
of
siam
ever
since
siam
began
to
exist
as
a
kingdom
and
a
nation
so
that
everybody
preyed
upon
his
weaker
neighbor
and
everybody
was
obliged
to
suffer
without
hope
of
redress
the
wrongs
which
one
stronger
than
himself
could
inflict
meanwhile
the
mother
grew
more
and
more
impatient
for
her
trial
which
seemed
to
her
as
if
purposely
delayed
and
in
an
unguarded
moment
she
accused
the
padre
tomas
of
having
secreted
the
jewels
and
ornaments
of
the
altar
of
tâmsèng
and
of
having
made
a
false
accusation
against
her
daughter
for
the
sole
purpose
of
laying
claim
to
her
estate
the
padre
became
exasperated
and
brought
a
charge
of
libel
against
the
mother
and
poor
rungeah
was
more
and
more
hopelessly
a
prisoner
the
timid
shut
himself
up
in
his
house
and
left
it
to
his
brave
wife
to
threaten
the
christian
officials
and
to
haunt
the
courts
with
her
complaints
expending
large
sums
of
money
but
without
result
at
length
as
rungeah
was
really
very
ill
and
i
feared
she
would
die
i
accompanied
khoon
jethamas
on
a
private
visit
to
his
highness
mom
kratai
rajoday
the
chief
judge
of
the
international
court
taking
with
me
a
private
letter
from
the
king
which
simply
stated
that
i
wished
to
be
made
personally
acquainted
with
him
the
judge
received
us
very
cordially
indeed
and
the
unhappy
jethamas
threw
herself
at
his
feet
and
with
tears
and
sobs
implored
of
him
to
hasten
the
trial
of
her
child
which
he
most
kindly
promised
to
do
it
was
now
december
and
three
days
after
our
visit
to
the
chief
judge
the
trial
came
on
i
could
not
attend
on
the
two
first
days
but
on
saturday
the
of
december
i
accompanied
khoon
jethamas
and
the
feeble
and
wasted
rungeah
to
the
court
where
i
was
rejoiced
to
see
his
highness
mom
kratai
rajoday
presiding
in
person
all
the
preliminaries
had
been
gone
through
with
on
the
two
previous
days
the
was
crammed
with
native
christians
buddhists
and
cambodians
so
that
there
was
not
even
standing
room
to
be
had
anywhere
after
going
through
a
great
many
forms
and
ceremonies
such
as
laying
the
right
hand
on
a
branch
of
the
and
thence
on
his
left
side
and
taking
the
buddhist
oath
innocence
was
clearly
proved
he
confessed
however
that
he
was
in
the
habit
of
repairing
to
the
chapel
morning
and
evening
but
that
his
sole
motive
was
to
be
near
by
to
protect
rungeah
from
any
danger
that
might
threaten
her
the
judge
then
turned
and
asked
rungeah
to
relate
again
all
that
she
had
done
on
the
night
of
the
robbery
all
her
natural
grace
of
feature
all
her
excellences
of
mind
and
soul
shone
out
as
she
calmly
repeated
her
story
the
only
thing
she
could
not
account
for
was
where
she
had
dropped
the
key
but
said
she
my
soul
and
my
conscience
acquit
me
of
this
sin
how
then
shall
i
plead
guilty
to
that
which
i
have
not
done
will
it
not
be
accounted
a
sin
against
myself
by
jesu
and
his
holy
mother
in
heaven
the
beating
hearts
of
the
crowd
were
suspended
in
breathless
expectation
some
being
interested
for
and
some
against
the
prisoners
the
next
moment
the
judge
declared
that
rungeah
and
had
been
imprisoned
on
insufficient
grounds
that
their
innocence
was
quite
apparent
even
without
or
rather
before
the
trial
and
that
the
case
was
dismissed
scarcely
were
these
words
articulated
when
a
shout
like
that
of
a
great
hurricane
broke
from
the
excited
masses
of
the
people
the
boarded
floor
seemed
to
thrill
and
ripple
as
with
the
throes
of
an
earthquake
and
the
crowd
staggered
to
and
fro
as
if
inebriated
with
the
sudden
paroxysm
of
joy
it
was
to
them
not
so
much
the
cause
of
a
young
and
beautiful
cambodian
lady
of
high
rank
as
the
cause
of
buddhism
against
roman
catholicism
i
was
stunned
with
their
deafening
roar
but
poor
rungeah
was
too
feeble
to
bear
the
sudden
and
overwhelming
joy
of
her
acquittal
an
exclamation
of
the
wildest
delight
broke
from
her
pale
lips
and
she
fell
back
insensible
the
excited
crowd
unable
to
master
their
now
as
sudden
agony
at
the
sight
of
the
apparently
lifeless
girl
were
hushed
and
a
lull
as
profound
as
death
succeeded
they
bore
her
to
the
boat
and
laid
her
down
in
it
and
her
mother
implored
me
to
go
home
with
them
in
the
fresh
air
as
we
rowed
slowly
along
the
girl
soon
revived
and
putting
out
her
arms
drew
her
mother
down
to
her
and
held
her
firmly
to
her
breast
her
brother
both
men
and
a
crowd
of
people
followed
in
another
boat
as
we
approached
the
temple
of
adi
buddha
annando
rungeah
whispered
to
her
mother
to
take
her
in
there
to
rest
that
she
was
weary
and
that
it
would
comfort
her
to
enter
its
sacred
precincts
once
more
the
sun
is
near
his
setting
and
broad
lights
and
shadows
are
lying
upon
and
veiling
the
grand
proportions
of
the
temple
of
the
infinite
now
the
boats
are
fastened
to
the
pier
and
a
little
group
follows
the
women
who
are
bearing
the
form
of
rungeah
into
the
temple
it
is
the
hour
of
the
buddhists
evening
prayer
they
bring
a
small
mat
and
she
is
laid
in
the
middle
of
the
temple
while
the
bonzes
are
seated
on
either
side
waiting
for
the
to
open
the
vesper
service
during
the
service
the
girl
lies
there
with
her
eyes
closed
sunshine
is
reflected
in
wonderful
glory
from
the
head
of
the
great
silver
image
of
the
adi
buddh
sunshine
is
flooding
the
temple
glorifying
the
stolid
idols
that
are
standing
around
and
streaming
on
the
floor
and
over
the
quiet
figure
of
the
girl
her
face
assumes
an
ashy
hue
and
she
again
puts
out
her
arms
and
draws
her
mother
down
to
her
o
mother
pray
to
the
virgin
mother
for
me
says
the
girl
to
tell
jesu
that
i
am
innocent
the
pagan
mother
makes
no
reply
but
bends
an
agonized
look
on
her
dear
child
face
and
the
girl
face
becomes
grayer
in
the
floods
of
sunlight
her
fingers
twitch
and
quiver
around
her
mother
neck
the
priests
are
hushed
and
the
temple
is
more
and
more
flooded
with
light
and
the
faint
sweet
pleading
voice
of
the
girl
is
again
heard
mother
dear
mother
pray
to
jesu
that
he
shut
not
the
heavenly
gates
upon
me
and
the
strong
love
of
the
mother
conquers
her
religious
scruples
and
lying
there
with
her
head
cushioned
on
the
bosom
of
her
dying
child
she
raises
her
voice
and
prays
o
thou
who
art
called
jesu
free
my
child
from
sin
o
forgive
her
sacred
one
she
has
loved
thee
to
the
last
she
believes
in
none
but
thee
be
thou
her
god
and
shut
not
o
shut
not
thy
heavenly
gates
upon
her
even
though
they
shut
her
out
forever
from
my
sorrowing
heart
and
eyes
at
the
utterance
of
those
strange
syllables
falling
from
the
lips
of
a
buddhist
mother
in
the
most
solemn
of
the
temples
of
the
buddha
a
marvellous
change
passed
over
the
face
of
the
dying
girl
the
gray
pallor
of
death
gave
place
to
a
heavenly
light
and
a
faint
but
lovely
smile
irradiated
her
pale
lips
she
opened
her
eyes
and
gazed
enraptured
upon
some
vision
that
seemed
to
float
before
her
o
mother
mother
cried
the
exulting
voice
of
the
girl
i
see
jesu
and
buddha
jesu
is
above
and
buddha
is
below
and
the
two
mothers
marie
and
maia
are
sitting
side
by

and
they
are
all
smiling
and
calling
me
upward
upward
and
rungeah
stretched
out
her
arms
and
closed
her
eyes
the
gray
pallor
returned
her
spirit
fluttered
for
a
moment
and
then
was
gone
forever
but
the
smile
never
left
her
lips
she
was
buried
with
the
rites
of
the
roman
catholic
church
with
her
rosary
and

was

having
gambled
away
all
the

of
his
spoils
he
once

returned
to

offered
to
deliver
up
the
jewels
if

the
general
effect
of

of
these
buildings
is
that
of
some
great
church
in
the
southern
part
of
europe
the
basement

is
a
square
mass
of
about
two
hundred
feet
on

side
with
double
rows
of
windows
flanked
by
pilasters
and
crowned
with
a
curious
flamboyant
spiral
canopy
in
what
may
be
called
the
style
these
pilasters
and
this
canopy
are
the
two
most
marked
and
universal
features
in
the
buddhist
architecture
at
the
middle
of

side
of
the
basement
rises
a
lofty
porch

terminating
in
an
immense
gabled
façade
pilastered

into

over

rise
a
number
of
diminishing
terraces
with
small
pagodas
at
the
angles
the
whole
culminating
in
a
pyramidal
steeple
like
the
hindoo
shivala
and
lastly
the
steeple
itself
is
crowned
with
a
chayatree
or
tapering
umbrella
of
gilt
rising
to
nearly
two
hundred
feet
from
the
ground
the
interior
consists
of
two
great
concentric
corridors
with
large
recesses
for
the
images
most
of
the
images
are
standing
figures
the

alone
is
either
seated

reclining
in
various
attitudes
of
benediction
or
preaching
on
elevated
pedestals
the
vaulted
cells
in
which
the

is
seated
reach
up
to
the
second
and
sometimes
to
the
third
terrace
and
from
a
small
window
in
the
roof
there
streams
a
flood
of
sunlight
downwards
on
the
head
and
shoulders
of
the
colossus
with
wonderful
effect
there
is
great
uncertainty
about
the
dates
and
builders
of
these
three
temples
and
i
know
nothing
more
interesting
and
beautiful
than
the
legend
which
is
attached
to
the
spot
on
which
they
stand
in
the
siamese
annals
however
it
is
stated
that
these
temples
have
stood
here
for
nearly
twelve
hundred
years
embedded
in
what
was
once
a
sacred
grove
of
olive
palm
and
boh
trees
before
bangkok
was
ever
settled
and
in
the
palmy
days
of
the
ancient
and
beautiful
city
of
ayodhya
or
ayudia
that
they
then
attracted
pilgrims
from
all
parts
of
the
world
particularly
women
who
came
to
perform
vows
or
to
offer
votive
sacrifices
at
their
shrines
it
was
chow
a
usurper
who
in
order
to
establish
more
securely
his
throne
selected
the
vicinity
of
these
triad
temples
as
the
seat
of
government
removed
his
palace
from
the
west
to
the
east
bank
of
the
mèinam
founded
a
city
surrounded
it
with
triple
walls
and
called
it
the
abode
of
the
beautiful
and
invincible
archangel
as
often
as
i
sat
in
the
porches
of
these
temples
the
chanted
prayers
of
the
worshippers
boomed
through
the
aisles
and
inspired
me
with
feelings
of
the
deepest
devotion
and
whenever
i
passed
along
the
dim
silent
corridors
and
came
unexpectedly
in
front
of
one
of
the
great
golden
images
with
its
folded
arms
and
drooping
eyelids
looking
down
upon
me
in
monitory
sadness
with
the
wisdom
of
ages
stamped
upon
its
brow
amid
the
gloom
of
a
twilight
while
the
head
and
shoulders
were
illuminated
by
a
halo
of
light
from
the
unseen
source
above
the
effect
was
strangely
mystical
solemn
and
profound
the
character
of
these
buildings
i
do
not
exaggerate
in
calling
them
sublime
they
prove
unmistakably
that
the
architect
whoever
he
was
wrought
in
a
sad
sincerity
himself
from
god
he
could
not
free
he
builded
better
than
he
knew
the
conscious
stone
to
beauty
grew
this
impression
was
deepened
every
time
i
visited
them
and
though
i
knew
every
inch
of
the
temples
and
their
surroundings
the
meanings
of
some
of
the
symbols
remained
mysterious
and
incomprehensible
if
i
succeeded
in
unravelling
one
portion
the
remainder
was
lost
in
inextricable
perplexity
and
doubt
my
pupils
in
that
wonderful
city
numbered
from
twenty
to
boys
and
girls
the
loveliest
and
most
remarkable
of
whom
were
the
the
prince
somdetch
paramendr
maha
chulalonkorn
his
younger
sister
the
little
creature
fa
ying
the
princesses
wanee
wahlacks
somawati
the
prince
the
only
son
of
ong
dwithwallabh
and
kabkranockratin
the
sons
of
the
and
in
addition
to
these
were
several
gentlewomen
of
the
harem
we
always
began
school
immediately
after
the
buddhists
morning
service
which
i
was
obliged
to
attend
so
as
to
muster
my
pupils
together
in
good
order
and
which
was
held
precisely
at
nine
in
the
temple
of
the
chom
manda
thai
the
long
inlaid
and
richly
gilt
table
on
which
we
pursued
our
studies
day
after
day
was
the
same
on
which
had
been
laid
every
morning
for
hundreds
of
years
offerings
to
the
priests
of
buddha
and
whereon
stood
the
bronze
censers
and
the
golden
vases
from
which
ascended
clouds
of
fragrant
incense
amid
the
perfume
of
still
more
fragrant
flowers
while
the
brilliant
colors
of
the
silks
satins
diamonds
and
jewels
that
adorned
the
regal
worshippers
relieved
the
gloom
the
studies
that
took
the
most
absolute
possession
of
the
fervid
eastern
imaginations
of
my
pupils
were
geography
and
astronomy
but
each
had
his
or
her
own
idea
about
the
form
of
the
earth
and
it
needed
no
small
amount
of
patient
repetition
to
convince
them
that
it
was
neither
flat
nor
square
but
round
the
only
map
and
a
very
ancient
one
it
was
which
they
had
ever
seen
was
one
drawn
and
painted
about
a
century
before
by
a
siamese
who
was
thought
to
possess
great
scientific
and
literary
attainments
illustration
queen
of
siam
this
map
was
five
feet
long
by
three
wide
in
the
centre
was
a
great
patch
of
red
and
above
it
a
small
patch
of
green
on
the
part
painted
red
which
was
intended
to
represent
siam
was
pasted
a
human
figure
cut
out
of
silver
paper
with
a
huge
pitchfork
in
one
hand
and
an
orange
in
the
other
there
was
a
crown
on
the
head
and
spurs
on
the
heels
and
the
sun
was
shining
over
all
the
legs
which
were
of
miserably
thin
dimensions
met
sympathetically
at
the
knees
and
this
creature
was
meant
for
the
king
of
siam
indicating
that
so
vast
were
his
strength
and
power
they
extended
from
one
end
of
his
dominions
to
the
other
in
the
little
patch
of
green
intended
to
represent
birmah
was
a
small
figure
consisting
of
a
little
dot
for
the
body
another
smaller
one
for
the
head
and
four
scratches
of
the
pen
for
the
legs
and
arms
this
was
meant
for
the
king
of
birmah
a
legion
of
little
imps
in
many
grotesque
attitudes
were
seen
dancing
about
his
dominions
and
these
almost
unintelligible
hieroglyphics
were
to
show
to
the
uninitiated
in
what
a
disturbed
state
the
birman
empire
was
and
what
an
insignificant
personage
in
his
own
dominions
was
the
king
of
that
country
on
the
north
side
of
the
green
patch
was
painted
a
huge
englishman
sporting
a
cocked
hat
with
red
feathers
clasping
in
his
arms
what
was
meant
for
a
vast
tract
of
land
this
was
marked
as
british
birmah
and
the
englishman
was
lord
clive
holding
on
to
it
the
rest
of
the
map
was
all
blue
and
all
around
the
siamese
territories
richly
painted
and
heavily
freighted
ships
were
sailing
to
and
fro
but
the
poor
birmese
monarch
had
not
a
boat
to
display
my
simple
pupils
knew
just
so
much
as
this
map
taught
them
and
no
more
birmah
on
the
north
and
siam
on
the
south
and
the
sea
all
around
this
was
the
world
to
them
but
of
their
celestial
geography
they
could
tell
me
a
host
of
interesting
particulars
all
of
which
they
would
relate
with
the
accuracy
and
picturesque
vividness
of
a
fairy
tale
and
whenever
a
dispute
arose
as
to
the
height
of
some
of
the
mountains
or
the
depth
or
breadth
of
the
oceans
in
the
celestial
worlds
they
would
at
once
refer
to
a
siamese
book
called
tri
loke
winit
chai
a
book
which
settles
all
questions
about
the
three
worlds
of
angels
of
demons
and
of
gods
and
find
therein
a
satisfactory
solution
of
their
difficulties
in
their
celestial
chronology
they
were
all
equally
well
grounded
a
little
fellow
of
nine
years
old
when
speaking
of
time
stood
upright
in
his
chair
and
informed
me
that
he
was
time
his
name
signified
a
period
of
time
appointed
for
the
creation
or
the
destruction
of
a
world
he
then
proceeded
to
tell
me
with
wonderful
clearness
for
one
so
young
that
the
first
time
or
kâp
is
reckoned
by
the
siamese
from
the
appearance
of
a
certain
cloud
called
which
was
the
harbinger
of
a
creative
rain
and
which
brought
into
existence
the
worlds
and
their
attendant
suns
and
moons
that
the
second
kâp
or
time
is
the
period
between
the
creation
of
these
worlds
and
the
coming
of
another
great
cloud
denominated
the
dissolving
cloud
and
which
is
the
third
kâp
and
the
forerunner
of
the
dissolution
of
the
worlds
and
the
fourth
kâp
is
the
period
when
matter
remains
in
a
chaotic
mass
waiting
for
the
generative
cloud
which
again
pours
forth
the
creative
rain
and
life
once
more
springs
into
being
these
four
periods
added
together
make
a
when
i
pressed
him
to
state
the
number
of
years
contained
in
a
he
became
indignant
and
replied
that
as
the
length
of
a
single
kâp
could
not
be
computed
by
the
gods
themselves
it
was
unreasonable
for
me
to
suppose
that
he
could
give
me
any
correct
estimate
of
their
actual
duration
i
soon
found
that
my
pupils
were
in
some
respects
much
wiser
than
i
and
thenceforth
we
exchanged
thoughts
and
ideas
i
gave
them
sound
realities
in
return
for
their
poetic
illusions
and
chimeras
which
had
for
me
a
certain
charm
and
a
great
deal
of
odd
reasonableness
for
it
was
their
way
of
explaining
the
incomprehensible
when
a
large
english
map
and
globes
of
the
celestial
and
terrestrial
spheres
arrived
they
created
quite
a
sensation
in
the
ancient
temple
of
the
mothers
of
the
free
his
majesty
caused
the
map
to
be
set
in
a
massive
gold
frame
and
placed
it
with
the
globes
on
ponderously
gilt
supporters
in
the
very
middle
of
the
temple
and
for
nine
days
crowds
of
women
came
to
be
instructed
in
the
sciences
of
geography
and
astronomy
so
that
i
found
my
hands
quite
full
it
was
hard
for
them
to
see
siam
reduced
to
a
mere
speck
on
the
great
globe
but
there
was
some
consolation
in
the
fact
that
england
occupied
even
a
smaller
space
after
the
first
excitement
had
worn
off
my
pupils
began
to
enjoy
their
lessons
they
would
cluster
round
the
globes
delighted
with
the
novel
idea
of
a
world
revolving
in
space
and
some
of
them
were
as
keen
as
any
arctic
explorer
for
the
discovery
of
the
north
pole
where
they
could
some
day
sit
astride
as
they
thought
with
perfect
ease
and
security
and
satisfy
their
doubts
about
the
form
and
the
revolution
of
the
earth
i
found
them
always
full
of
eager
inquiry
unlike
most
western
children
about
the
sun
and
moon
and
stars
but
they
preferred
to
have
them
peopled
with
demons
ghosts
and
hobgoblins
rather
than
to
have
them
uninhabited
on
one
occasion
when
i
informed
them
that
the
moon
was
supposed
to
be
uninhabited
all
the
little
eager
faces
were
clouded
and
their
interest
flagged
and
little
wanee
declared
that
for
her
part
she
was
convinced
that
the
moon
was
the
beautiful
daughter
of
a
great
king
of
ayudia
who
lived
many
thousands
of
years
ago
and
the
head
wife
of
the
sun
and
not
a
great
stupid
ball
of
earth
and
rock
rolling
about
in
the
sky
to
no
purpose
but
for
the
sun
to
shine
upon
one
day
the
steamer
chow
brought
his
majesty
a
box
of
ice
from
singapore
and
i
obtained
some
for
an
the
women
and
children
found
no
difficulty
in
believing
that
it
was
water
frozen
but
when
i
went
to
tell
them
about
snow
the
whole
school
became
indignant
at
what
they
considered
an
evident
stretch
of
my
imagination
and
my
dear
simple
friend
laid
her
hand
gently
upon
my
arm
and
said
please
do
not
say
that
again
i
believe
you
like
my
own
heart
in
everything
you
have
taught
to
me
but
this
sounds
like
the
story
of
a
little
child
who
wishes
to
say
something
more
wonderful
than
anything
that
was
ever
said
before
so
my
lesson
of
the
snow
proved
a
to
me
for
several
days
my
pupils
imaginations
had
taken
alarm
and
they
could
not
be
brought
to
believe
the
simplest
statements
i
informed
his
majesty
of
my
dilemma
he
came
to
my
aid
and
assured
the
royal
children
that
it
was
just
possible
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
snow
for
english
books
of
travel
spoke
frequently
of
some
phenomenon
which
they
designated
as
snow
on
another
occasion
as
we
were
all
busily
engaged
in
tracing
the
river
nile
on
an
ancient
map
of
egypt
there
fell
suddenly
from
the
vaulted
roof
above
our
heads
and
upon
the
very
centre
of
our
chart
on
the
table
a
coil
of
something
that
looked
at
first
like
a
beautiful
thick
silk
cord
neatly
rolled
up
in
another
instant
however
the
coil
unrolled
itself
and
began
to
move
slowly
away
i
screamed
and
fled
to
the
extreme
end
of
the
temple
but
what
was
my
surprise
to
see
all
my
pupils
sitting
calmly
in
their
seats
with
their
hands
folded
in
veneration
and
their
eyes
fixed
in
glowing
admiration
on
the
serpent
as
it
moved
in
tortuous
curves
along
the
entire
length
of
the
table
with
a
blush
of
shame
and
a
sense
of
inferiority
i
returned
to
my
seat
and
watched
with
them
the
beautiful
creature
a
certain
feeling
of
fascination
dawned
upon
me
as
i
looked
into
its
clear
bright
penetrating
eyes
the
upper
part
was
of
a
fine
violet
color
its
sides
covered
with
large
scales
of
crimson
edged
with
black
the
abdominal
parts
were
of
a
pale
edged
likewise
with
black
while
the
tail
terminated
in
tints
of
a
bluish
ash
of
singular
delicacy
and
beauty
as
the
snake
slowly
dragged
itself
to
the
end
of
the
table
i
held
my
breath
in
terror
for
it
dropped
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
on
which
the
prince
somdetch
choufa
chulalonkorn
was
seated
whence
it
fell
on
the
floor
trailed
itself
along
through
the
dim
corridor
and
down
the
steps
and
finally
passed
out
of
sight
under
the
stone
basement
of
the
temple
on
the
moment
of
its
disappearance
my
pupils
jumped
up
from
their
seats
and
clustered
around
me
in
the
wildest
joy
caressing
me
and
declaring
that
the
gods
loved
me
dearly
else
they
would
not
have
sent
me
such
an
auspicious
token
in
favor
of
my
teaching
i
was
told
that
the
gliding
of
the
snake
all
over
the
table
was
full
of
happy
omens
and
that
its
dropping
on
the
arm
of
the
prince
chair
was
an
unmistakable
sign
that
he
would
one
day
become
famous
in
wisdom
and
knowledge
all
the
old
and
young
women
congratulated
me
as
did
even
the
king
himself
who
when
he
heard
of
the
singular
visitor
we
had
had
caused
the
circumstance
to
be
made
known
to
the
wise
men
and
women
of
the
court
and
they
all
united
in
pronouncing
it
to
be
a
wonderful
and
inspiring
recognition
of
favor
from
on
high
from
this
time
i
was
treated
with
great
consideration
and
respect
by
the
women
and
mothers
of
the
harem
but
i
nevertheless
felt
not
a
little
uncomfortable
for
days
after
the
sudden
descent
of
the
snake
and
secretly
hoped
i
might
never
again
be
so
signally
favored
by
the
gods
i
afterwards
learned
that
this
snake
has
three
names
in
sanskrit
it
is
celebrated
as
the
sarpa
rakta
the
red
snake
who
brings
secret
omens
from
the
gods
in
pali
as
the
naghalalvana
the
crimson
snake
of
the
woods
who
carries
on
his
person
in
glowing
letters
the
name
of
his
great
master
and
in
siamese
gnuthongdang
the
snake
who
brings
with
its
appearance
all
that
is
good
and
great
to
the
beholder
i
leave
it
with
my
readers
to
decide
which
is
the
better
our
inherited
dread
of
and
desire
to
destroy
the
serpent
race
or
the
siamese
custom
of
idealizing
though
with
a
certain
superstitious
reverence
the
meanest
of
the
works
of
nature
among
the
ladies
of
the
harem
i
knew
one
woman
who
more
than
all
the
rest
helped
to
enrich
my
life
and
to
render
fairer
and
more
beautiful
every
lovely
woman
i
have
since
chanced
to
meet
her
name
translated
itself
and
no
other
name
could
ever
have
been
so
appropriate
into
hidden
perfume
her
clear
dark
eyes
were
clearer
and
calmer
her
full
lips
had
a
stronger
expression
of
tenderness
about
them
and
her
brow
which
was
at
times
smooth
and
open
and
at
others
contracted
with
pain
grew
nobler
and
more
beautiful
as
the
purposes
of
her
life
strengthened
by
new
elements
grew
deeper
and
broader
each
day
she
had
been
deprived
of
her
opportunity
of
loving
as
a
wife
and
a
woman
and
the
sorrow
that
had
broken
up
the
fountains
of
her
nature
now
caused
them
to
flow
into
deeper
channels
for
she
had
become
an
earnest
and
devoted
mother
our
daily
lessons
and
talks
had
become
a
part
of
her
happiest
moments
they
gave
her
entrance
into
a
new
world
without
requiring
that
she
should
abandon
any
part
of
the
old
world
she
had
known
or
that
she
should
accept
any
new
religious
feelings
or
dogmas
her
aim
was
to
find
out
all
things
that
are
pure
noble
brave
and
good
and
to
adopt
them
whether
pagan
or
christian
in
their
origin
and
to
leave
dogmas
creeds
and
doctrines
to
those
who
were
inclined
to
them
by
temperament
one
day
it
being
the
siamese
sâbâto
sabbath
i
called
at
her
house
on
my
way
home
in
passing
into
the
little
room
that
she
had
fitted
up
to
receive
me
and
which
we
had
dignified
with
the
title
of
the
study
i
saw
that
my
friend
in
the
room
adjoining
was
at
prayer
kneeling
before
her
altar
on
which
was
a
gilt
image
of
the
buddha
while
on
either
side
hung
pictures
of
the
king
and
her
little
son
the
room
in
which
she
knelt
was
a
gay
one
covered
with
birmese
paper
on
which
were
seen
huge
trees
some
standing
and
others
uprooted
and
carried
away
by
the
inundation
of
a
mighty
tropical
river
here
and
there
drifting
along
passive
and
lifeless
and
anon
covered
with
gay
flowers
thousands
of
miles
distant
the
sun
left
open
his
golden
gates
that
his
waves
of
light
might
rest
in
benediction
and
with
protecting
fondness
on
her
dark
upturned
face
and
colored
brow
there
was
a
mysterious
joy
in
her
worship
which
transfigured
by
its
soft
inner
light
her
otherwise
not
beautiful
face
and
she
seemed
as
if
she
were
holding
direct
communion
in
her
inner
soul
with
the
infinite
spirit
i
stepped
into
the
study
and
waited
until
her
prayer
was
offered
up
in
a
little
time
after
i
heard
her
clear
voice
calling
me
and
in
another
moment
i
was
seated
beside
her
at
the
foot
of
her
pretty
little
altar
she
then
asked
me
to
look
at
her
paper
which
i
did
telling
her
that
i
thought
it
was
a
very
gay
one
indeed
for
her
little
oratory
i
see
you
do
not
understand
the
meaning
of
it
and
she
proceeded
to
explain
the
allegory
to
me
in
her
quaint
and
broken
english
that
big
green
tree
there
said
she
is
like
unto
me
when
i
was
young
and
ignorant
rejoicing
in
earthly
distinctions
and
affections
and
then
i
am
brought
as
a
gift
to
a
great
king
and
only
think
how
grand
and
how
rich
i
may
become
and
there
you
see
that
i
am
drooping
and
my
leaves
are
all
withering
and
begin
to
fall
here
i
am
shattered
and
uprooted
by
a
sense
of
sorrow
and
humiliation
drifting
along
an
impetuous
river
but
by
and
by
a
little
flower
stops
my
downward
course
that
little
flower
is
my
child
he
springs
out
of
the
very
waters
which
threatened
my
destruction
and
now
he
grows
into
a
garden
of
flowers
to
hide
away
from
me
that
which
would
make
me
sad
and
sorrowful
again
and
now
i
am
always
glad
after
a
little
while
desirous
of
knowing
what
the
glittering
image
of
buddha
really
was
to
her
i
said
kindly
sonn
klean
you
were
praying
to
that
idol
she
did
not
reply
at
once
but
at
length
laying
her
hand
gently
upon
my
arm
said
shall
i
say
of
you
dear
friend
that
you
worship
the
ideal
or
image
which
you
have
of
your
god
in
your
own
mind
and
not
the
god
even
so
say
not
of
me
that
i
worship
the
golden
image
up
there
but
the
great
one
who
sent
me
my
teacher
buddha
that
he
might
be
the
guide
and
the
light
of
my
life
on
another
occasion
when
she
read
and
translated
the
sermon
on
the
mount
she
suddenly
exclaimed
with
great
emotion
o
your
sacred
jesus
is
very
beautiful
let
us
promise
one
another
that
whenever
you
pray
to
jesus
you
will
call
him
buddha
the
enlightened
one
and
i
when
i
pray
to
my
buddha
i
will
call
him
jesu
karuna
the
tender
and
sacred
jesus
for
surely
these
are
only
different
names
for
the
one
and
the
same
god
her
favorite
book
however
was
uncle
tom
cabin
and
she
would
read
it
over
and
over
again
though
she
knew
all
the
characters
by
heart
and
spoke
of
them
as
if
she
had
known
them
all
her
life
on
the
of
january
she
invited
me
to
dinner
and
she
sent
to
me
in
the
course
of
the
day
so
many
messages
telling
me
to
be
sure
to
come
that
i
began
to
suspect
it
was
going
to
be
a
very
grand
entertainment
so
i
put
on
my
best
dress
and
made
myself
as
fine
as
i
could
my
friend
was
looking
down
the
street
with
her
head
and
shoulders
out
of
her
window
as
we
appeared
and
the
moment
she
saw
us
she
rushed
to
greet
us
in
her
own
sweet
cordial
manner
dinner
was
served
in
the
study
for
it
boasted
of
one
table
and
five
chairs
but
our
party
numbered
six
in
all
so
my
boy
and
the
prince
kreta
were
obliged
to
squeeze
themselves
into
one
chair
and
then
there
was
one
apiece
for
the
rest
of
us
we
were
served
by
peguan
in
the
peguan
fashion
on
little
silver
plates
the
kneeling
around
us
fish
rice
jelly
and
a
variety
of
sweetmeats
came
first
then
different
kinds
of
vegetables
after
them
a
course
of
meat
venison
and
birds
of
all
kinds
and
we
finished
with
sweet
drinks
preserves
and
fruit
when
dinner
was
over
my
friend
in
concert
with
her
sisters
and
performed
on
several
musical
instruments
with
wonderful
effect
at
last
all
sonn
klean
with
their
children
appeared
in
a
group
one
hundred
and
in
all
in
nice
new
dresses
all
looking
particularly
happy
i
am
wishful
to
be
good
like
harriet
beecher
stowe
or
stowâ
as
my
friend
persisted
in
pronouncing
that
name
and
never
to
buy
human
bodies
again
but
only
to
let
go
free
once
more
and
so
i
have
now
no
more
slaves
but
hired
servants
i
have
given
freedom
to
all
of
my
slaves
to
go
or
to
stay
with
me
as
they
wish
if
they
go
away
to
their
homes
i
am
glad
if
they
stay
with
me
i
am
still
more
glad
and
i
will
give
them
each
four
ticals
every
month
after
this
day
with
their
food
and
clothes
thenceforth
to
express
her
entire
sympathy
and
affection
for
the
author
of
uncle
tom
cabin
she
always
signed
herself
harriet
beecher
stowe
and
her
sweet
voice
trembled
with
love
and
music
whenever
she
spoke
of
the
lovely
american
lady
who
had
taught
her
even
as
buddha
had
once
taught
kings
to
respect
the
rights
of
her
during
a
severe
illness
which
confined
me
a
month
or
more
to
my
room
i
used
to
receive
the
most
affectionate
letters
from
this
dear
lady
signed
harriet
beecher
stowe
and
when
i
once
more
returned
to
the
palace
she
took
all
the
credit
of
my
recovery
from
an
illness
so
fatal
as
cholera
as
due
to
her
intercessions
and
prayers
in
one
temple
she
had
vowed
that
she
would
save
seven
thousand
lives
if
mine
were
granted
to
her
prayers
i
was
perplexed
and
curious
to
know
how
she
would
perform
the
conditions
of
such
a
vow
but
she
assured
me
there
would
be
no
difficulty
about
it
and
forthwith
despatched
her
to
the
market
to
purchase
seven
baskets
containing
each
a
thousand
live
fish
which
with
great
pomp
and
ceremony
were
set
free
again
in
the
river
and
the
seven
thousand
lives
were
thus
actually
saved
one
day
when
i
was
sitting
with
my
friend
in
her
little
study
she
learned
that
i
had
recently
lost
a
very
dear
relative
and
she
related
to
me
in
a
voice
full
of
the
tenderest
sympathy
and
affection
the
following
buddhist
legend
which
i
give
here
as
nearly
as
possible
in
her
own
words
in
the
village
of
sârvâthi
there
lived
a
young
wife
named
keesah
who
at
the
age
of
fourteen
gave
birth
to
a
son
and
she
loved
him
with
all
the
love
and
joy
of
the
possessor
of
a
newly
found
treasure
for
his
face
was
like
a
golden
cloud
his
eyes
fair
and
tender
as
a
blue
lotus
and
his
smile
bright
and
beaming
like
the
morning
light
upon
the
dewy
flowers
but
when
the
boy
was
able
to
walk
and
could
run
about
the
house
there
came
a
day
when
he
suddenly
fell
sick
and
died
and
keesah
not
understanding
what
had
happened
to
her
fair
boy
clasped
him
to
her
bosom
and
went
about
the
village
from
house
to
house
praying
and
weeping
and
beseeching
the
good
people
to
give
her
some
medicine
to
cure
her
baby
but
the
villagers
and
neighbors
on
seeing
her
said
the
girl
mad
that
she
still
bears
about
on
her
breast
the
dead
body
of
her
child
at
length
a
holy
man
pitying
the
girl
sorrow
said
to
himself
this
keesah
does
not
understand
the
law
of
death
i
will
try
to
comfort
her
and
he
answered
her
and
said
good
girl
i
can
not
myself
give
you
any
medicine
to
cure
your
boy
but
i
know
a
holy
and
wise
physician
who
can
said
the
young
mother
tell
me
who
it
is
that
i
may
go
at
once
to
him
and
the
holy
man
replied
is
called
the
buddha
he
alone
can
cure
thy
child
then
keesah
on
hearing
this
was
comforted
and
set
out
to
find
the
buddha
still
clasping
to
her
heart
the
lifeless
body
of
her
child
and
when
she
found
him
she
bowed
down
before
him
and
said
my
lord
and
master
do
you
know
of
any
medicine
that
will
cure
my
baby
and
the
buddha
replied
and
said
i
know
of
one
but
you
must
get
it
for
me
and
she
asked
medicine
do
you
want
tell
me
that
i
may
hasten
in
search
of
it
and
the
buddha
said
want
only
a
few
grains
of
leave
here
the
boy
and
go
you
and
bring
them
to
me
the
girl
refused
to
part
with
her
baby
but
promised
to
get
the
seed
for
him
as
she
was
about
to
set
out
the
pitiful
buddha
recalling
her
said
sister
the
that
i
require
must
be
taken
from
a
house
where
no
child
parent
husband
wife
relative
or
slave
has
ever
died
the
young
mother
replied
good
my
lord
and
went
her
way
taking
her
boy
with
her
and
setting
him
astride
on
her
hip
with
his
lifeless
head
resting
on
her
bosom
thus
she
went
from
house
to
house
from
palace
to
hut
begging
for
some
grains
of
the
people
said
to
her
are
the
seeds
take
them
and
go
thy
way
but
she
first
asked
this
my
friend
house
has
there
ever
died
a
child
a
husband
a
parent
or
a
slave
and
they
one
and
all
replied
what
is
this
that
thou
hast
said
knowest
thou
not
that
the
living
are
few
but
that
the
dead
are
many
there
is
no
such
house
as
thou
seekest
then
she
went
to
other
houses
and
begged
the
grains
of
which
they
gladly
gave
her
but
to
her
questionings
one
said
have
lost
a
son
another
have
lost
a
parent
and
yet
another
have
lost
a
slave
and
every
one
and
all
of
them
made
some
such
reply
at
last
not
being
able
to
discover
a
single
house
free
from
the
dead
whence
she
could
obtain
the
and
feeling
utterly
faint
and
weary
she
sat
herself
down
upon
a
stone
with
her
baby
in
her
lap
and
thinking
sadly
said
to
herself
this
is
a
heavy
task
i
have
undertaken
i
am
not
the
only
one
who
has
lost
her
baby
everywhere
children
are
dying
parents
are
dying
loved
ones
are
dying
and
everywhere
they
tell
me
that
the
dead
are
more
numerous
than
the
living
shall
i
then
think
only
of
my
own
sorrow
thinking
thus
she
suddenly
summoned
courage
to
put
away
her
sorrow
for
her
dead
baby
and
she
carried
him
to
the
forest
and
laid
him
down
to
rest
under
a
tree
and
having
covered
him
over
with
tender
leaves
and
taking
her
last
look
of
his
loved
face
she
betook
herself
once
more
to
the
buddha
and
bowed
before
him
and
he
said
to
her
hast
thou
found
the
have
not
my
lord
she
replied
the
people
in
the
village
tell
me
there
is
no
house
in
which
some
one
has
not
died
for
the
living
are
few
but
the
dead
are
many
where
is
your
baby
have
laid
him
under
a
tree
in
the
forest
my
lord
said
keesah
gently
then
said
the
buddha
to
her
have
found
the
grains
of
you
thought
that
you
alone
had
lost
a
son
but
now
you
have
learned
that
the
law
of
death
and
of
suffering
is
among
all
living
creatures
and
that
here
there
is
no
permanence
on
hearing
this
keesah
was
comforted
and
established
in
the
path
of
virtue
and
was
thenceforth
called
keesah
godami
the
disciple
of
the
buddha
the
pleasantest
of
the
days
that
i
spent
in
the
city
of
the
nang
harm
were
those
that
fell
on
the
first
full
moons
in
the
months
of
may
which
days
are
always
held
as
the
anniversary
of
the
birth
inspiration
and
death
of
the
buddha
on
the
morning
of
the
of
may
i
was
conducted
by
a
number
of
to
the
residence
of
my
pupil
the
child
wife
her
house
was
a
brick
building
with
a
low
wall
running
round
it
which
took
in
some
few
acres
of
ground
devoted
to
gardens
and
to
residences
for
her
numerous
slaves
and
attendants
i
was
the
first
that
morning
to
pass
between
the
two
brick
and
mortar
lions
which
guarded
the
entrance
and
after
a
kindly
greeting
i
took
my
place
at
the
inner
end
of
the
hall
or
antechamber
which
gave
access
to
the
residence
the
child
wife
a
remarkably
pretty
little
woman
dressed
in
pure
white
silk
stood
in
the
hall
beside
a
small
marble
fountain
with
her
two
sons
on
either
side
of
her
all
round
the
fountain
were
huge
china
vases
containing
plants
covered
with
flowers
and
between
them
were
immense
silver
each
large
enough
to
hold
a
couple
of
men
and
each
containing
a
huge
silver
ladle
thirty
or
more
young
were
engaged
in
filling
them
with
cool
fresh
water
drawn
from
a
well
in
the
garden
the
hall
was
freshly
furnished
with
striped
and
with
cushioned
seats
for
a
hundred
guests
in
the
garden
opposite
the
doors
of
the
hall
was
a
circular
thatched
roof
supported
on
one
great
mast
like
a
tent
and
this
was
the
theatre
erected
for
the
occasion
in
one
part
was
an
elevated
stage
for
the
marionettes
and
the
whole
was
very
gracefully
and
prettily
ornamented
showing
as
did
everything
around
a
desire
to
please
and
to
entertain
some
fifty
came
from
an
inner
court
hearing
on
their
heads
massive
silver
dishes
of
sweetmeats
and
choice
viands
and
placed
them
along
the
hall
then
came
some
maidens
dressed
in
pure
white
and
arranged
flowers
in
small
gold
vases
beside
each
of
the
seats
designed
for
the
expected
guests
and
when
this
was
done
they
took
their
places
behind
their
mistress
it
was
early
morning
just
seven
but
this
entire
city
had
been
up
for
hours
engaged
in
the
important
work
of
rightly
celebrating
the
great
day
the
grounds
around
the
house
were
all
in
a
glow
with
roses
and
the
pure
silver
of
the
glistened
resplendently
in
the
morning
sunlight
the
gate
was
thrown
wide
open
and
into
this
scene
amid
flowers
and
sunshine
and
fragrance
and
the
dew
still
trembling
on
the
leaves
were
ushered
in
the
guests
one
by
one
a
hundred
decrepit
filthy
unsightly
looking
covered
with
dirt
and
rags
and
the
vilest
uncleanliness
and
the
child
wife
who
might
have
numbered
summers
but
who
looked
as
if
she
were
only
sixteen
blushing
with
a
delicacy
and
beauty
of
her
own
advances
and
greets
her
strange
guests
with
all
the
more
respect
and
tenderness
because
of
their
rags
and
poverty
leads
them
gently
and
seats
them
on
low
stools
around
her
sparkling
fountain
removes
their
disgusting
apparel
and
proceeds
with
the
aid
of
her
maidens
to
wash
them
clean
with
fragrant
soap
and
great
draughts
of
cool
water
ladled
out
of
the
silver
jars
what
a
transformation
when
the
matted
hair
was
washed
and
combed
and
parted
and
dressed
with
flowers
and
the
rags
were
replaced
by
new
robes
of
purest
white
then
she
led
them
towards
the
hall
and
seated
them
on
the
silk
cushions
before
the
silver
trays
and
bowed
on
her
knees
before
them
and
served
to
them
the
delicacies
prepared
for
them
as
if
they
each
one
and
all
deserved
from
her
some
special
token
of
her
love
and
veneration
after
breakfast
the
music
struck
up
and
the
actors
and
puppets
appeared
on
the
stage
the
music
was
particularly
good
the
royal
female
bands
were
assembled
for
the
occasion
and
relieved
each
other
in
succession
the
acting
was
occasionally
interspersed
with
the
plaintive
notes
of
female
voices
the
priestesses
of
this
beautiful
scene
who
seemed
sometimes
deeply
moved
collected
from
within
themselves
all
the
charms
and
joys
of
love
to
pour
them
forth
with
the
inspiration
of
music
at
the
feet
of
their
lowly
listeners
and
at
length
as
the
curtain
of
the
last
act
dropped
and
the
prolonged
cadence
of
the
voices
and
the
instruments
died
away
a
loud
buzz
of
delight
and
pleasure
broke
from
the
listening
crowd
of
old
decrepit
women
who
received
each
a
sum
of
money
from
their
kind
hostess
and
went
on
their
lonely
way
rejoicing
this
said
my
friend
to
me
i
do
every
year
to
show
my
love
and
obedience
to
my
dear

max

mentions
this
parable
in
his
lecture
on
buddhist
nihilism
as
translated
from

but
the
birmese
text
is
slightly
different
from
that
of
the
siamese
footnote
the
siamese
are
naturally
very
fond
of
music
and
even
persons
of
high
rank
think
it
no
disparagement
to
acquire
a
proficiency
in
the
art
whence
their
great
skill
in
music
and
in
architecture
it
would
be
difficult
to
explain
more
especially
as
their
music
exhibits
great
poetical
genius
and
has
a
remarkably
pleasing
measure
it
might
naturally
be
supposed
that
they
had
derived
their
music
from
the
same
source
that
they
have
their
religion
the
softness
the
playful
sweetness
and
simplicity
of
the
former
seeming
to
harmonize
in
great
measure
with
the
humane
tenets
the
pure
morality
and
the
beauty
of
the
latter
the
music
of
the
siamese
peguans
and
of
laos
differs
from
that
of
most
indian
nations
in
being
played
upon
different
keys
a
feature
which
characterizes
the
pathetic
music
of
certain
european
and
in
particular
the
scottish
and
welsh
nations
there
is
certainly
no
harsh
or
disagreeable
sound
no
abrupt
transition
no
grating
sharpness
all
is
soft
lively
sweet
and
harmonious
to
a
degree
which
seemed
to
me
quite
surprising
they
have
certainly
arrived
far
beyond
the
point
of
being
merely
pleased
with
sound
they
have
far
a
higher
aim
that
of
interesting
the
feelings
of
awakening
thought
or
emotion
their
pieces
of
music
are
very
numerous
some
of
the
women
who
perform
before
the
king
know
by
heart
a
hundred
and
fifty
tunes
their
memory
and
their
performance
are
equally
remarkable
and
surprising
chapter
xxx
the
siamese
system
of
slavery
under
the
late
king
his
majesty
somdetch
paramendr
maha
mongkut
there
existed
in
siam
a
mixed
system
of
slavery
in
part
resembling
the
old
system
of
english
feudal
service
in
part
the
former
serfdom
of
russia
and
again
in
part
the
peonage
of
mexico
three
fourths
of
the
population
of
siam
are
in
this
condition
of
modified
slavery
branded
with
the
mark
of
their
owners
or
held
by
their
creditors
in
a
form
of
qualified
servitude
to
work
out
a
debt
the
royal
family
princes
and
chief
rulers
and
magistrates
of
the
country
are
the
only
exceptions
to
this
rule
but
even
they
are
obliged
to
serve
the
king
in
times
of
war
or
to
provide
a
fitting
substitute
slaves
in
the
minute
subdivisions
of
the
law
are
classed
under
seven
different
heads
first
prisoners
of
war
second
slaves
by
purchase
third
slaves
by
birth
fourth
by
gifts
and
legacies
fifth
those
who
become
slaves
from
gratitude
sixth
voluntary
slaves
in
times
of
famine
seventh
debtors
and
their
children
but
these
may
all
be
embraced
in
three
general
classes
called
prie
baw
and
bâtt
that
of
slaves
by
birth
and
attached
to
the
land
of
slaves
by
purchase
and
of
slaves
captured
in
war
the
prisoners
of
war
and
their
descendants
are
composed
of
the
following
nations
and
numbers
malays
fifty
thousand
thousand
peguans
one
million
laotians
thousand
and
birmese
fifty
thousand
all
these
with
few
exceptions
belong
to
the
kings
of
siam
some
few
are
given
to
the
principal
nobles
and
chiefs
who
have
distinguished
themselves
in
the
state
but
even
these
with
their
descendants
are
held
as
baw
chow
chewitt
the
king
slaves
the
captured
in
war
and
all
their
numerous
descendants
belong
exclusively
to
the
second
king
the
first
or
supreme
king
having
a
positive
antipathy
to
that
people
they
are
formed
into
an
army
under
the
command
of
the
second
king
to
guard
his
person
palaces
harem
etc
the
malays
and
peguans
are
employed
as
sailors
and
soldiers
in
company
with
the
native
siamese
these
are
all
branded
on
the
left
side
a
little
below
the
armpit
and
they
are
bound
to
serve
three
months
in
every
year
the
remaining
time
they
may
employ
in
their
own
private
interests
the
slaves
by
purchase
are
divided
into
two
classes
redeemable
and
irredeemable
the
first
class
must
furnish
security
that
they
will
fulfil
the
legal
requirements
of
their
masters
these
can
always
free
themselves
by
refunding
the
or
can
change
their
masters
on
procuring
payment
of
the
sum
due
to
the
old
masters
the
second
class
are
chiefly
young
girls
sold
by
their
parents
relatives
or
owners
with
these
no
security
is
either
given
or
taken
because
they
generally
become
the
wives
or
concubines
of
the
buyer
as
a
natural
consequence
more
than
four
fifths
abscond
whenever
they
get
an
opportunity
and
the
owner
has
no
redress
are
not
branded
or
enrolled
as
the
are
husbands
may
sell
their
wives
parents
their
children
and
masters
their
slaves
and
debtors
but
no
one
can
sell
an
adult
after
he
is
sixteen
or
a
after
she
has
attained
puberty
without
his
or
her
consent
prices
of
slaves
vary
according
to
the
appearance
color
strength
physical
proportions
and
parentage
of
the
person
sold
from
one
hundred
and
twenty
ticals
for
men
and
sixty
to
a
hundred
ticals
for
women
but
if
the
woman
be
fair
and
pleasing
in
form
and
feature
she
will
bring
as
much
as
a
thousand
ticals
for
the
harem
of
a
great
noble
the
method
of
selling
one
self
is
very
simple
every
man
on
becoming
a
slave
signs
an
agreement
of
which
i
give
a
copy
below
this
paper
his
master
retains
but
is
obliged
to
surrender
whenever
the
slave
produces
the
amount
mentioned
in
it

khow
at
the
time
and
hour
of
being
set
free
such
is
the
bill
of
sale
but
as
it
generally
happens
that
the
parents
have
also
sold
themselves
some
other
security
is
required
which
is
given
in
another
paper
the
value
of
anything
that
the
slave
may
break
or
destroy
is
added
to
the
original
account
the
masters
are
bound
to
furnish
their
slaves
with
rice
and
fish
daily
but
not
with
clothes
the
position
of
the
slaves
by
birth
differs
in
no
respect
from
that
of
slaves
by
purchase
with
the
exception
that
while
the
prices
of
the
latter
vary
the
price
of
the
former
is
fixed
by
law
for
every
age
size
and
sex
and
the
owners
can
not
demand
more
for
them
than
that
which
is
determined
by
the
law
the
severest
punishment
for
slaves
is
being
made
to
work
in
chains
if
no
improvement
takes
place
from
this
punishment
the
slave
is
handed
over
to
the
king
judges
and
is
provided
the
crime
or
misdemeanor
is
proven
incarcerated
in
the
siamese
convict
prison
a
punishment
to
which
death
itself
is
preferable
the
principal
hardship
that
the
slave
suffers
is
being
obliged
to
marry
at
the
will
of
his
or
her
owner
and
this
with
a
people
who
are
highly
susceptible
of
conjugal
affection
is
often
the
cause
of
great
suffering
to
the
women
then
comes
the
difficulty
of
lodging
a
complaint
against
their
masters
for
an
insufficiency
of
food
and
sometimes
for
an
absolute
want
of
clothes
for
which
latter
even
the
law
does
not
hold
the
master
responsible
there
are
four
conditions
under
which
a
slave
is
freed
from
the
obligations
of
servitude
slaves
voluntarily
manumitted
by
their
masters
slaves
admitted
to
the
priesthood
those
who
are
given
to
serve
the
priests
and
when
the
master
himself
takes
the
vows
of
a
priest
he
is
obliged
to
free
all
his
slaves
as
the
ecclesiastical
court
will
not
otherwise
receive
him
into
the
priesthood
and
he
can
at
no
time
reclaim
them
for
actual
service
unless
on
quitting
the
priesthood
he
repurchases
them
debtors
may
be
made
slaves
when
they
do
not
pay
the
interest
for
money
borrowed
and
will
not
work
to
make
good
the
failure
of
payment
and
in
case
of
death
the
nearest
relative
becomes
a
slave
till
the
original
amount
with
the
interest
added
is
refunded
the
rate
of
interest
in
siam
is
about
thirty
per
cent
and
the
poor
are
unable
unless
by
labor
to
pay
such
an
exorbitant
rate
if
the
bought
or
rather
the
redeemable
slave
should
die
in
his
service
even
after
a
lifetime
of
labor
the
security
must
refund
the
original
sum
or
become
a
slave
in
his
stead
if
a
slave
be
sick
and
is
attended
to
during
his
illness
in
his
master
house
the
security
is
liable
for
the
interest
of
the
slave
during
the
period
of
illness
when
children
are
sold
under
the
full
value
they
must
not
be
beaten
till
they
bleed
when
a
slave
volunteers
out
of
affection
for
his
master
or
mistress
to
take
his
or
her
place
in
prison
or
in
torture
one
half
of
his
or
her
must
be
refunded
to
the
security
but
if
the
slave
is
irredeemable
no
part
is
to
be
refunded
if
a
man
sell
a
slave
and
after
receiving
the
money
refuse
to
give
him
or
her
up
to
the
purchaser
he
shall
pay
double
the
sum
three
fourths
to
the
buyer
and
one
fourth
into
the
government
or
state
treasury
if
a
buyer
disapprove
of
a
slave
before
three
months
have
elapsed
he
may
recover
his
money
if
a
master
strike
his
slave
so
that
he
die
no
claim
can
be
made
upon
the
security
and
the
master
shall
be
punished
according
to
the
law
anything
that
a
slave
may
break
can
be
added
at
the
will
of
the
owner
to
the
if
in
herding
cattle
he
be
negligent
and
they
be
lost
he
shall
pay
for
them
if
more
be
given
into
his
charge
than
he
can
attend
to
he
shall
pay
only
half
but
if
robbers
bind
him
and
steal
the
cattle
he
can
not
be
held
responsible
any
claim
against
a
slave
must
be
made
by
the
owner
before
he
is
sold
to
another
party
if

a
female

have
they
to
do
with
the
glad
shouts
and
the
loud
rejoicings
that
resound
on

side
to
them
it
means
only
a
change
of

and
royalty
is
the

fixed
to
the
other
end
of
the
enslaving
rod
of
power
the
right
divine
of
kings
to
govern
wrong
there
can
be
no
auspicious
reign
or
any
happy
future
for
the
slave
illustration
king
of
siam
the
royal
messages
of
peace
and
may
find
an
echo
in
the
freedman
heart
and
in
his
home
but
they
must
ever
come
with
a
darkening
power
and
as
a
saddening
cloud
to
the
home
and
the
heart
of
the
slave
an
irredeemable
beast
of
burden
what
has
he
to
hope
from
an
auspicious
reign
or
the
enthronement
of
a
promising
sovereign
yet
that
these
millions
of
enslaved
men
and
women
are
not
brutes
or
wild
beasts
or
even
devoid
of
noble
and
generous
emotions
is
proved
by
the
most
astonishing
acts
of
devotion
and
performed
by
slaves
for
the
masters
and
mistresses
whom
they
have
learned
to
love
any
one
who
from
curiosity
or
with
a
higher
motive
may
visit
the
prisons
in
the
city
of
bangkok
will
find
to
his
great
surprise
that
nearly
one
half
of
the
inmates
are
slaves
voluntarily
expiating
the
crimes
and
of
their
masters
and
mistresses
or
as
is
often
the
case
mothers
daughters
wives
or
sisters
enduring
all
the
hardships
of
a
siamese
prison
and
words
would
fail
me
adequately
to
describe
the
amount
of
suffering
which
those
two
words
imply
in
the
place
and
for
the
sake
of
sons
husbands
or
unworthy
relatives
the
strength
that
is
in
these
slaves
to
suffer
is
the
strength
of
love
love
combined
with
despair
gives
them
the
awful
and
wonderful
power
of
utter
the
rights
which
every
man
should
enjoy
in
his
wife
his
children
and
his
own
labor
and
which
should
be
the
most
sacred
and
inviolable
rights
are
here
placed
at
the
mercy
of
a
master
and
are
to
the
slave
the
very
fetters
of
his
galling
servitude
but
since
that
of
october
a
new
empire
has
arisen
out
of
the
ashes
of
the
old
the
traditions
and
customs
of
centuries
are
as
naught
a
fresh
start
has
been
made
a
young
king
full
of
generous
impulses
and
noble
purposes
reigns
and
how
he
intends
to
govern
may
be
gathered
from
his
second
royal
proclamation
to
his
people
on
the
subject
of
religion
in
regard
to
the
concern
of
seeking
and
holding
a
religion
that
will
be
a
refuge
to
you
in
this
life
it
is
a
good
and
noble
concern
and
it
is
exceedingly
appropriate
and
suitable
that
you
as
a
nation
and
each
man
individually
should
investigate
for
himself
and
according
to
his
own
wisdom
which
is
the
right
and
which
the
wrong
and
if
you
see
any
religion
whatever
or
any
body
of
men
professing
any
religion
whatsoever
who
seem
likely
to
be
an
advantage
to
you
a
true
religion
in
accordance
with
your
own
wisdom
hold
to
that
religion
with
all
your
heart
hold
to
it
not
with
a
shallow
mind
or
after
slight
investigation
or
even
because
of
its
tradition
saying
this
is
the
custom
held
from
time
immemorial
but
from
your
own
deep
faith
in
its
excellence
and
do
not
profess
a
religion
for
the
truth
of
which
you
have
not
good
evidence
or
one
which
frightens
men
through
their
fears
and
flatters
them
through
their
hopes
do
not
be
either
frightened
or
flattered
into
doing
what
is
right
and
just
and
do
not
follow
after
fictitious
signs
and
wonders
but
when
you
shall
have
obtained
a
firm
conviction
in
any
religious
faith
that
it
is
true
beautiful
and
good
hold
to
it
with
great
joy
follow
its
teachings
alone
and
it
will
be
a
source
of
happiness
to
each
one
of
you
it
is
our
will
that
our
subjects
of
whatever
race
nation
or
creed
live
freely
and
happily
in
our
kingdom
no
man
despising
or
molesting
another
on
account
of
religious
difference
or
any
other
difference
of
opinions
customs
or
manners
this
is
the
second
important
message
from
the
young
king
who
has
just
ascended
the
throne
of
his
fathers
to
his
subjects
both
bond
and
free
the
great
old
dukes
and
princes
and
nobles
of
the
realm
feel
in
their
hardened
hearts
that
it
is
barely
gracious
and
certainly
not
at
all
graceful
in
one
so
young
to
ignore
all
that
magnificent
past
but
the
young
monarch
is
true
to
his
early
promise
and
his
next
step
is
quietly
to
abolish
the
customary
prostrations
before
a
superior
and
to
inaugurate
a
new
costume
for
his
people
which
will
enable
the
wearer
whoever
he
may
be
prince
ruler
chieftain
or
slave
to
stand
face
to
face
with
his
and
erect
in
the
presence
of
his
sovereign
and
now
let
us
mark
the
next
step
made
in
the
path
of
progress
and
freedom
by
this
noble
young
buddhist
monarch
years
ago
in
the
little
study
in
his
beautiful
palace
called
the
house
when
a
mere
boy
on
hearing
of
the
death
of
president
lincoln
he
had
declared
that
if
he
ever
lived
to
reign
over
siam
he
would
reign
over
a
free
and
not
an
enslaved
nation
that
it
would
be
his
pride
and
joy
to
restore
to
his
kingdom
the
original
constitution
under
which
it
was
first
planted
by
a
small
colony
of
hardy
and
brave
buddhists
who
fled
from
their
native
country
magadah
to
escape
the
religious
persecutions
of
the
brahminical
priests
who
had
arrived
at
ayudia
and
there
established
themselves
under
one
of
their
leaders
who
was
at
once
priest
and
king
they
called
the
spot
they
occupied
muang
thai
the
kingdom
of
the
free
and
this
kingdom
now
extends
from
the
northern
slopes
of
the
mountains
of
yuman
in
china
to
the
gulf
of
siam
nobly
has
he
striven
to
keep
this
aspiration
of
his
early
boyhood
and
as
he
went
day
after
day
to
take
his
place
at
the
head
of
his
government
and
to
the
nightly
sittings
of
the
secret
council
of
the
state
he
endeavored
to
hold
unflinchingly
to
his
one
great
purpose
on
the
first
opportunity
that
offered
he
urged
the
abolition
of
slavery
upon
the
prince
regent
his
uncle
and
the
prime
minister
then
again
he
brought
it
before
the
mighty
secret
council
sitting
at
midnight
in
the
hall
of
his
ancestors
i
see
says
the
brave
young
king
no
hope
for
our
country
until
she
is
freed
from
the
dark
blot
of
slavery
the
prince
regent
and
the
prime
minister
though
almost
persuaded
by
the
vehement
pleading
of
the
young
and
fearless
king
replied
it
is
impossible
to
free
a
nation
of
slaves
without
incurring
much
risk
and
danger
to
the
state
and
to
the
slaveholders
under
the
existing
laws
siam
could
not
abolish
her
system
of
slavery
without
undermining
at
the
same
time
her
whole
constitution
well
said
the
young
king
let
it
be
so
but
my
slaves
my
soldiers
and
my
debtors
are
my
own
and
i
will
free
them
at
least
whatever
my
ministers
may
see
fit
to
do
for
my
part
no
human
being
shall
ever
again
be
branded
in
my
name
and
with
my
mark
what
strange
words
from
one
so
young
the
secret
council
meet
again
and
again
to
discuss
the
matter
and
at
length
they
decide
for
they
too
have
the
good
of
their
country
at
heart
to
let
the
young
king
have
his
own
way
then
the
royal
boy
king
sends
another
message
summoning
the
heads
of
all
his
people
from
every
department
of
his
vast
kingdom
to
appear
together
in
his
audience
hall
and
to
receive
the
royal
message
standing
on
the
lowest
step
of
his
glittering
throne
he
greets
the
chief
rulers
and
governors
and
judges
of
his
people
and
utters
these
remarkable
words
let
this
our
royal
message
to
our
people
be
proclaimed
and
not
as
if
we
were
doing
a
great
and
lordly
thing
but
our
simple
duty
to
our
and
subjects
that
from
the
first
day
of
january
slavery
shall
cease
to
be
an
institution
in
our
country
and
every
man
woman
and
child
shall
hold
themselves
citizens
and
further
let
it
be
made
known
that
a
tax
according
to
the
circumstances
of
each
and
every
man
shall
be
levied
on
the
nation
to
remunerate
the
slaveholders
for
the
loss
of
their
slaves
the
effect
of
this
speech
upon
the
listeners
can
hardly
be
imagined
it
was
like
the
winged
words
of
an
angel
from
heaven
and
the
young
monarch
descended
from
the
last
step
of
his
throne
having
firmly
laid
the
on
which
the
greatness
of
his
reign
and
his
nation
will
forever
rest
unshaken
but
seeing
that
his
astonished
hearers
remained
rooted
to
the
spot
still
doubting
whether
they
had
heard
aright
he
added
we
bind
ourselves
to
fulfil
our
word
to
our
subjects
at
large
no
matter
what
the
cost
to
ourselves
go
you
and
proclaim
our
royal
will
when
the
wonderful
tidings
were
actually
proclaimed
the
people
listened
as
though
they
heard
not
at
best
they
distrusted
the
good
report
and
received
the
wondrous
words
as
if
they
were
merely
the
sounding
of
brass
and
the
tinkling
of
cymbals
in
their
ears
confidence
is
a
plant
of
slow
growth
but
how
slow
must
its
revival
have
been
in
the
place
whence
it
has
once
been
torn
up
by
the
roots
so
the
people
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
the
loving
messages
of
their
young
king
and
went
on
their
sad
way
not
a
whit
happier
but
when
the
of
january
had
actually
arrived
and
they
absolutely
found
themselves
free
men
and
women
their
patient
loving
hearts
burst
asunder
with
joy
the
glad
cries
of
the
ransomed
millions
penetrated
the
heart
of
the
universe
and
the
despair
of
the
nation
flapped
her
dark
wings
and
fell
down
dead
at
the
golden
feet
of
the
royal
ransomer
the
prison
doors
are
open
and
all
the
prisoners
by
proxy
and
those
who
were
slaves
by
reason
of
their
great
poverty
or
their
greater
love
find
to
their
amazement
that
the
sun
of
freedom
has
risen
for
them
and
who
shall
fathom
the
depth
of
their
joy
but
the
land
is
full
of
flower
shows
and
unfurled
standards
and
cool
fountain
displays
fireworks
illuminations
and
theatrical
exhibitions
the
music
of
thousands
of
choristers
and
the
glad
huzzas
of
congregated
myriads
rend
the
air
let
them
dance
and
laugh
and
sing
they
have
had
enough
of
slavery
and
too
little
of
freedom
and
the
great
hymn
of
the
nation
ascends
to
the
ruler
of
kings
for
the
ransomed
one
glory
to
god
in
the
highest
and
on
earth
peace
and
towards

the

a
legend
of
the
gold
and
silver
mines
of
siam
vela
chow
or
the
beautiful
dawn
was
the
only
daughter
of
a
very
powerful
king
of
ayudia
she
was
so
wondrously
beautiful
that
the
old
brahmins
and
astrologers
who
foretold
her
birth
named
her
even
before
she
was
born
the
beautiful
dawn
as
the
only
appropriate
name
for
her
now
it
happened
that
at
the
time
of
vela
chow
birth
there
was
no
moon
to
illuminate
the
fair
earth
but
the
golden
sun
and
the
green
earth
enjoyed
a
much
closer
and
more
intimate
friendship
than
they
now
do
and
old
age
sickness
and
death
were
unknown
to
the
blessed
and
undying
people
of
ayudia
but
as
the
mighty
king
somdetch
batt
the
duke
of
the
golden
foot
had
reigned
nearly
three
thousand
five
hundred
years
without
ceasing
he
became
weary
of
the
cares
of
state
and
thereupon
abdicated
in
favor
of
his
young
son
batt
bandethâno
a
vigorous
youth
of
not
more
than
five
hundred
years
of
age
who
was
even
from
his
childhood
an
especial
favorite
of
the
and
monarch
athiett
the
sun
in
the
course
of
time
the
friendship
between
these
two
bandethâno
and
athiett
sovereigns
of
the
earth
and
sky
ripened
to
such
a
degree
of
perfection
that
the
latter
was
loath
to
withdraw
his
bright
beaming
face
from
his
young
friend
kingdom
even
to
seek
his
couch
for
a
little
rest
at
night
as
had
been
his
custom
from
time
immemorial
thus
he
beamed
forth
both
night
and
day
in
saffron
hues
on
the
fair
mountains
and
lovely
valleys
of
the
invincible
city
of
ayudia
and
the
land
flourished
in
luxuriance
and
beauty
the
fruits
and
flowers
rivalled
those
that
grew
and
blossomed
in
indra
own
garden
and
countless
birds
of
marvellous
plumage
winged
their
flight
from
distant
worlds
to
build
their
nests
and
warble
their
exquisite
melodies
among
the
proud
forests
of
this
favored
land
as
for
the
men
of
this
region
they
were
tall
and
stately
and
of
golden
mien
like
the
gandharwas
of
indra
paradise
and
the
women
were
gloriously
beautiful
fair
as
silvery
clouds
with
eyes
of
wondrous
hue
so
that
no
mortal
man
could
look
upon
one
of
them
and
not
yield
his
spirit
to
the
sweet
frenzy
of
inextinguishable
love
away
flew
the
golden
days
and
nights
and
round
and
round
rushed
the
radiant
of
athiett
and
thousands
and
thousands
of
years
sped
away
but
he
never
relaxed
the
speed
of
his
swift
coursers
nor
drew
in
his
reins
nor
turned
away
even
for
an
instant
his
glowing
eyes
from
this
favored
kingdom
now
things
having
gone
on
in
this
way
for
several
thousands
of
years
yet
no
sweet
slumber
had
ever
closed
the
godlike
eyes
of
athiett
and
all
the
lovely
dowâstrâs
the
stars
finding
themselves
totally
eclipsed
their
brilliancy
and
beauty
marred
by
this
unceasing
sleeplessness
on
the
part
of
their
sovereign
formed
the
wicked
and
cruel
design
of
revolting
against
him
and
of
taking
possession
by
some
means
or
other
of
his
golden
car
accordingly
instead
of
going
to
sleep
as
had
hitherto
been
their
practice
during
the
day
they
all
plotted
together
to
hide
themselves
behind
the
curtain
of
their
monarch
chariot
and
to
watch
his
movements
in
order
to
discover
the
cause
of
the
singular
attraction
that
drew
him
forever
towards
the
earth
while
he
left
his
own
vaulted
and
ethereal
hemisphere
to
the
tender
mercies
of
stray
suns
or
wandering
comets
having
ratified
with
many
an
oath
and
many
a
vow
their
wicked
compact
the
treacherous
dowâstrâs
instead
of
going
to
bed
like
the
dutiful
children
of
a
kind
and
beneficent
ruler
only
pretended
to
sleep
but
all
the
while
kept
opening
and
shutting
and
blinking
their
bright
inquisitive
little
eyes
winking
at
one
another
and
peering
behind
the
golden
curtains
of
the
royal
chariot
at
their
unconscious
master
who
fully
believing
that
all
his
subjects
were
sound
asleep
grew
brighter
and
brighter
while
over
his
round
genial
face
there
beamed
forth
a
smile
of
ineffable
radiance
as
he
approached
the
earth
at
this
very
moment
the
rebellious
dowâstrâs
wondering
at
the
blissful
face
of
their
monarch
peered
out
from
behind
the
drapery
of
the
celestial
chariot
and
turned
their
penetrating
eyes
towards
the
earth
where
to
their
astonishment
they
beheld
the
matchless
form
and
the
divinely
beautiful
face
of
vela
chow
who
was
lulling
her
wearied
father
to
rest
with
the
music
of
her
sweet
voice
ah
ah
laughed
the
wicked
dowâstrâs
now
we
have
found
out
the
secret
as
soon
as
she
had
soothed
her
father
to
sleep
the
lovely
vela
chow
all
unconscious
of
what
was
happening
around
her
sauntered
forth
among
the
unfrequented
woods
and
dells
making
the
voiceless
hills
and
rocks
her
merry
notes
in
melodious
sounds
now
culling
rare
wild
flowers
to
wreathe
round
her
lovely
brow
now
bathing
her
little
feet
in
the
cool
crystal
waters
of
a
purling
brook
that
murmured
gently
through
the
mountain
caves
and
caverns
and
anon
raising
her
glad
heart
in
thanksgiving
and
praise
to
the
great
beneficent
and
glorious
athiett
at
length
she
sat
herself
down
in
the
deep
solitude
to
rest
and
as
she
listened
to
the
gentle
zephyrs
that
fanned
her
yellow
tresses
or
rustled
amidst
the
topmost
boughs
of
the
forest
trees
the
birds
plucked
for
her
the
ripest
and
the
sweetest
fruits
and
some
dropped
them
at
her
side
and
others
less
timid
hovered
around
her
holding
them
in
their
tender
bills
each
fluttering
against
the
other
and
striving
to
be
the
favored
one
to
whom
she
would
open
her
sweet
mouth
to
be
fed
and
while
the
birds
were
thus
rivalling
each
other
in
their
delicate
attentions
to
the
lovely
maiden
it
chanced
that
a
gorgeous
butterfly
more
glorious
than
any
she
had
ever
before
seen
alighted
on
a
neighboring
flower
up
sprang
vela
chow
and
away
she
flew
after
it
from
flower
to
flower
from
shrub
to
tree
until
at
last
the
tantalizing
butterfly
flew
so
high
in
the
air
that
the
eager
damsel
could
do
no
more
than
raise
her
fair
face
and
sparkling
eyes
to
follow
its
airy
flight
through
the
bright
sky
just
at
this
moment
athiett
golden
chariot
was
coming
over
the
hill
and
he
smiled
a
smile
of
such
ineffable
delight
when
he
caught
sight
of
her
that
he
dazzled
the
eyes
of
the
poor
little
maiden
and
as
she
could
no
longer
see
the
beautiful
butterfly
she
was
obliged
to
relinquish
all
idea
of
capturing
it
so
she
retraced
her
disconsolate
steps
to
her
lonely
mountain
stream
and
plunged
into
its
waters
in
the
hope
of
finding
therein
refreshment
and
forgetfulness
of
her
cruel
disappointment
but
athiett
was
not
to
be
thus
baffled
so
he
noiselessly
climbed
higher
and
higher
and
approached
nearer
and
nearer
and
smiled
so
much
more
warmly
than
ever
that
he
once
more
quite
overpowered
the
weary
maiden
who
suddenly
vanished
from
his
sight
sought
refuge
in
her
favorite
mountain
cavern
and
there
fell
sound
asleep
for
a
moment
poor
athiett
was
disconcerted
and
a
great
pain
like
a
dark
heavy
cloud
shot
up
from
his
heart
and
overspread
his
bright
happy
face
and
he
knew
not
what
to
do
but
the
next
he
broke
forth
into
a
more
joyous
smile
than
ever
for
he
was
just
as
foolish
as
he
was
old
and
had
been
on
the
lookout
all
these
thousands
of
years
night
and
day
hoping
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
this
incomparable
maiden
the
moment
he
did
so
he
fell
desperately
in
love
with
her
and
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
perform
his
journey
without
one
more
look
at
her
sweet
pure
face
therefore
instead
of
going
on
his
way
through
the
sky
he
changed
his
course
and
drove
at
a
furious
rate
down
the
towards
the
cavern
alighted
from
his
chariot
and
crept
softly
into
the
cave
where
the
lovely
vela
chow
slumbered
and
smiled
upon
her
with
such
rapturous
tenderness
that
the
sleeping
maiden
heart
was
penetrated
and
completely
captivated
she
opened
her
beautiful
eyes
with
a
joyful
sense
of
a
new
and
delicious
emotion
upon
athiett
who
beamed
upon
her
so
lovingly
and
with
such
irresistible
pleadings
in
his
godlike
eyes
that
she
could
not
refuse
to
return
his
affection
and
they
there
and
then
exchanged
vows
of
eternal
friendship
and
love
but
alas
while
the
and
happy
lovers
were
thus
fondly
conversing
together
and
athiett
was
painting
in
glowing
words
the
beauty
of
his
heavenly
the
wicked
dowâstrâs
in
all
haste
rushed
to
the
drove
off
the
golden
chariot
and
unharnessed
the
coursers
having
thus
cut
off
his
retreat
they
raised
a
shout
of
triumph
deposed
their
infatuated
monarch
and
established
a
republic
among
themselves
permitting
neither
stray
suns
nor
wandering
comets
to
have
anything
to
do
with
their
government
poor
athiett
who
was
now
about
to
conduct
his
sweet
happy
bride
to
his
celestial
kingdom
found
to
his
consternation
and
grief
that
his
golden
chariot
had
vanished
he
bowed
his
head
and
his
great
joyous
face
became
suddenly
overcast
all
its
light
and
glory
departed
while
large
tears
like
mountain
torrents
rolled
from
his
godlike
eyes
and
streamed
upon
the
earth
and
were
there
and
then
transformed
into
nuggets
of
the
purest
gold
then
the
mountains
pitying
his
sufferings
opened
their
hearts
and
revealed
to
him
a
secret
passage
by
which
he
might
regain
his
heavenly
abode
athiett
bade
a
sad
adieu
to
the
lovely
vela
chow
and
with
promise
of
speedy
return
set
out
shedding
golden
tears
all
along
the
way
in
search
of
his
missing
chariot
and
as
for
the
unhappy
vela
chow
the
moment
she
lost
sight
of
her
beloved
athiett
she
drooped
her
fair
head
in
unspeakable
sorrow
and
followed
him
with
aching
heart
and
faltering
step
all
the
way
searching
for
the
lost
chariot
and
shedding
abundantly
her
bright
beautiful
tears
which
as
they
fell
upon
the
rocky
sides
of
the
mountains
changed
their
flinty
arteries
into
veins
of
the
purest
and
most
precious
silver
thus
the
grief
of
these
two
godlike
hearts
served
to
enrich
the
country
with
endless
wealth
at
the
end
of
twelve
hours
however
the
wicked
stars
repented
of
their
cruel
conduct
and
a
fresh
compact
was
made
between
the
republican
dowâstrâs
and
the
godlike
lover
athiett
wherein
it
was
expressly
agreed
that
for
a
fortnight
in
every
month
he
should
pick
up
his
beautiful
bride
at
the
mouth
of
the
cavern
and
take
her
with
him
to
his
celestial
home
but
that
for
the
rest
of
the
month
she
should
unveil
her
matchless
face
and
reveal
her
exquisite
beauty
to
the
dowâstrâs
and
rule
over
them
in
the
sky
for
they
all
it
seems
had
also
fallen
desperately
in
love
with
her
and
it
was
distinctly
stipulated
that
athiett
should
never
attempt
to
approach
her
while
she
reigned
as
their
queen
and
mistress
in
the
heavens
and
to
distinguish
her
in
her
new
regal
character
the
dowâstrâs
changed
her
name
from
vela
chow
to
rupea
chandra
the
silver
moon
to
all
this
athiett
readily
assented
for
he
was
impatient
to
regain
his
chariot
and
to
hear
away
his
lovely
bride
but
it
is
said
that
even
to
this
day
while
vela
chow
is
presiding
in
queenlike
splendor
over
the
jealous
dowâstrâs
athiett
is
foolish
enough
at
times
for
now
and
then
he
can
not
restrain
his
affection
to
attempt
to
kiss
her
when
all
the
siamese
fearing
lest
he
should
again
be
dethroned
turn
out
and
shout
and
fire
cannons
and
beat
drums
to
warn
him
of
the
impropriety
of
his
proceedings
which
in
the
space
of
two
or
three
hours
this
being
the
time
it
is
said
that
sound
takes
to
travel
to
the
sun
and
moon
generally
produces
the
desired
effect
of
recalling
the
monarch
to
himself
thus
are
the
gold
and
silver
mines
and
the
lunar
and
solar
eclipses
accounted
for
in
the
siamese
legends
and
annual
pilgrimages
are
still
made
to
the
cavern
where
the
lovely
vela
chow
