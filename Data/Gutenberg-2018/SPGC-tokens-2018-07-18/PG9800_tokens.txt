this
edition
published
preface
it
has
been
the
aim
of
the
editor
in
preparing
this
little
book
to
get
together
sufficient
material
to
afford
a
student
in
one
of
our
high
schools
or
colleges
adequate
and
typical
specimens
of
the
vigorous
and
versatile
genius
of
alexander
pope
with
this
purpose
he
has
included
in
addition
to
rape
of
the
lock
the
on
criticism
as
furnishing
the
standard
by
which
pope
himself
expected
his
work
to
be
judged
the
epistle
of
the
on
man
as
a
characteristic
example
of
his
didactic
poetry
and
the
to
arbuthnot
both
for
its
exhibition
of
pope
genius
as
a
satirist
and
for
the
picture
it
gives
of
the
poet
himself
to
these
are
added
the
famous
close
of
the
the
to
solitude
a
specimen
of
pope
infrequent
lyric
note
and
the
on
gay
the
first
edition
of
rape
of
the
lock
has
been
given
as
an
appendix
in
order
that
the
student
may
have
the
opportunity
of
comparing
the
two
forms
of
this
poem
and
of
realizing
the
admirable
art
with
which
pope
blended
old
and
new
in
the
version
that
is
now
the
only
one
known
to
the
average
reader
the
text
throughout
is
that
of
the
globe
edition
prepared
by
professor
ward
the
editor
can
lay
no
claim
to
originality
in
the
notes
with
which
he
has
attempted
to
explain
and
illustrate
these
poems
he
is
indebted
at
every
step
to
the
labors
of
earlier
editors
particularly
to
elwin
courthope
pattison
and
hales
if
he
has
added
anything
of
his
own
it
has
been
in
the
way
of
defining
certain
words
whose
meaning
or
connotation
has
changed
since
the
time
of
pope
and
in
paraphrasing
certain
passages
to
bring
out
a
meaning
which
has
been
partially
obscured
by
the
poet
effort
after
brevity
and
concision
in
the
general
introduction
the
editor
has
aimed
not
so
much
to
recite
the
facts
of
pope
life
as
to
draw
the
portrait
of
a
man
whom
he
believes
to
have
been
too
often
misunderstood
and
misrepresented
the
special
introductions
to
the
various
poems
are
intended
to
acquaint
the
student
with
the
circumstances
under
which
they
were
composed
to
trace
their
literary
genesis
and
relationships
and
whenever
necessary
to
give
an
outline
of
the
train
of
thought
which
they
embody
in
conclusion
the
editor
would
express
the
hope
that
his
labors
in
the
preparation
of
this
book
may
help
if
only
in
some
slight
degree
to
stimulate
the
study
of
the
work
of
a
poet
who
with
all
his
limitations
remains
one
of
the
abiding
glories
of
english
literature
and
may
contribute
not
less
to
a
proper
appreciation
of
a
man
who
with
all
his
faults
was
on
the
evidence
of
those
who
knew
him
best
not
only
a
great
poet
but
a
very
human
and
lovable
personality

the
first
edition
of
the
rape
of
the
lock
introduction
perhaps
no
other
great
poet
in
english
literature
has
been
so
differently
judged
at
different
times
as
alexander
pope
accepted
almost
on
his
first
appearance
as
one
of
the
leading
poets
of
the
day
he
rapidly
became
recognized
as
the
foremost
man
of
letters
of
his
age
he
held
this
position
throughout
his
life
and
for
over
half
a
century
after
his
death
his
works
were
considered
not
only
as
masterpieces
but
as
the
finest
models
of
poetry
with
the
change
of
poetic
temper
that
occurred
at
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
pope
fame
was
overshadowed
the
romantic
poets
and
critics
even
raised
the
question
whether
pope
was
a
poet
at
all
and
as
his
poetical
fame
diminished
the
harsh
judgments
of
his
personal
character
increased
it
is
almost
incredible
with
what
exulting
bitterness
critics
and
editors
of
pope
have
tracked
out
and
exposed
his
petty
intrigues
exaggerated
his
delinquencies
misrepresented
his
actions
attempted
in
short
to
blast
his
character
as
a
man
both
as
a
man
and
as
a
poet
pope
is
sadly
in
need
of
a
defender
and
a
defense
is
by
no
means
impossible
the
depreciation
of
poetry
springs
in
the
main
from
an
attempt
to
measure
it
by
other
standards
than
those
which
he
and
his
age
recognized
the
attacks
upon
his
character
are
due
in
large
measure
to
a
misunderstanding
of
the
spirit
of
the
times
in
which
he
lived
and
to
a
forgetfulness
of
the
special
circumstances
of
his
own
life
tried
in
a
fair
court
by
impartial
judges
pope
as
a
poet
would
be
awarded
a
place
if
not
among
the
noblest
singers
at
least
high
among
poets
of
the
second
order
and
the
flaws
of
character
which
even
his
warmest
apologist
must
admit
would
on
the
one
hand
be
explained
if
not
excused
by
circumstances
and
on
the
other
more
than
counterbalanced
by
the
existence
of
noble
qualities
to
which
his
assailants
seem
to
have
been
quite
blind
alexander
pope
was
born
in
london
on
may
his
father
was
a
roman
catholic
linen
draper
who
had
married
a
second
time
pope
was
the
only
child
of
this
marriage
and
seems
to
have
been
a
delicate
precocious
and
perhaps
a
rather
spoiled
child
pope
religion
and
his
chronic
are
two
facts
of
the
highest
importance
to
be
taken
into
consideration
in
any
study
of
his
life
or
judgment
of
his
character
the
high
hopes
of
the
catholics
for
a
restoration
of
their
religion
had
been
totally
destroyed
by
the
revolution
of
during
all
pope
lifetime
they
were
a
sect
at
once
feared
hated
and
oppressed
by
the
severest
laws
they
were
excluded
from
the
schools
and
universities
they
were
burdened
with
double
taxes
and
forbidden
to
acquire
real
estate
all
public
careers
were
closed
to
them
and
their
property
and
even
their
persons
were
in
times
of
excitement
at
the
mercy
of
informers
in
the
last
year
of
pope
life
a
proclamation
was
issued
forbidding
catholics
to
come
within
ten
miles
of
london
and
pope
himself
in
spite
of
his
influential
friends
thought
it
wise
to
comply
with
this
edict
a
fierce
outburst
of
persecution
often
evokes
in
the
persecuted
some
of
the
noblest
qualities
of
human
nature
but
a
and
crushing
tyranny
that
extends
to
all
the
details
of
daily
life
is
only
too
likely
to
have
the
most
unfortunate
results
on
those
who
are
subjected
to
it
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
find
that
the
catholics
of
pope
day
lived
in
an
atmosphere
of
disaffection
political
intrigue
and
evasion
of
the
law
most
unfavorable
for
the
development
of
that
frank
courageous
and
patriotic
spirit
for
the
lack
of
which
pope
himself
has
so
often
been
made
the
object
of
reproach
in
a
passage
of
the
to
arbuthnot
pope
has
spoken
of
his
life
as
one
long
disease
he
was
in
fact
a
humpbacked
dwarf
not
over
four
feet
six
inches
in
height
with
long
legs
and
arms
he
was
subject
to
violent
headaches
and
his
face
was
lined
and
contracted
with
the
marks
of
suffering
in
youth
he
so
completely
ruined
his
health
by
perpetual
studies
that
his
life
was
despaired
of
and
only
the
most
careful
treatment
saved
him
from
an
early
death
toward
the
close
of
his
life
he
became
so
weak
that
he
could
neither
dress
nor
undress
without
assistance
he
had
to
be
laced
up
in
stiff
stays
in
order
to
sit
erect
and
wore
a
fur
doublet
and
three
pairs
of
stockings
to
protect
himself
against
the
cold
with
these
physical
defects
he
had
the
extreme
sensitiveness
of
mind
that
usually
accompanies
chronic
ill
health
and
this
sensitiveness
was
outraged
incessantly
by
the
brutal
customs
of
the
age
pope
enemies
made
as
free
with
his
person
as
with
his
poetry
and
there
is
little
doubt
that
he
felt
the
former
attacks
the
more
bitterly
of
the
two
dennis
his
first
critic
called
him
a
short
squab
gentleman
the
very
bow
of
the
god
of
love
his
outward
form
is
downright
monkey
a
rival
poet
whom
he
had
offended
hung
up
a
rod
in
a
coffee
house
where
men
of
letters
resorted
and
threatened
to
whip
pope
like
a
naughty
child
if
he
showed
his
face
there
it
is
said
though
perhaps
not
on
the
best
authority
that
when
pope
once
forgot
himself
so
far
as
to
make
love
to
lady
mary
wortley
montague
the
answer
was
a
fit
of
immoderate
laughter
in
an
appendix
to
the
pope
collected
some
of
the
epithets
with
which
his
enemies
had
pelted
him
an
ape
an
ass
a
frog
a
coward
a
fool
a
little
abject
thing
he
affected
indeed
to
despise
his
assailants
but
there
is
only
too
good
evidence
that
their
poisoned
arrows
rankled
in
his
heart
richardson
the
painter
found
him
one
day
reading
the
latest
abusive
pamphlet
these
things
are
my
diversion
said
the
poet
striving
to
put
the
best
face
on
it
but
as
he
read
his
friends
saw
his
features
writhen
with
anguish
and
prayed
to
be
delivered
from
all
such
diversions
as
these
pope
enemies
and
their
savage
abuse
are
mostly
forgotten
pope
furious
retorts
have
been
secured
to
immortality
by
his
genius
it
would
have
been
nobler
no
doubt
to
have
answered
by
silence
only
but
before
one
condemns
pope
it
is
only
fair
to
realize
the
causes
of
his
bitterness
pope
education
was
short
and
irregular
he
was
taught
the
rudiments
of
latin
and
greek
by
his
family
priest
attended
for
a
brief
period
a
school
in
the
country
and
another
in
london
and
at
the
early
age
of
twelve
left
school
altogether
and
settling
down
at
his
father
house
in
the
country
began
to
read
to
his
heart
delight
he
roamed
through
the
classic
poets
translating
passages
that
pleased
him
went
up
for
a
time
to
london
to
get
lessons
in
french
and
italian
and
above
all
read
with
eagerness
and
attention
the
works
of
older
english
poets
spenser
waller
and
dryden
he
had
already
it
would
seem
determined
to
become
a
poet
and
his
father
delighted
with
the
clever
boy
talent
used
to
set
him
topics
force
him
to
correct
his
verses
over
and
over
and
finally
when
satisfied
dismiss
him
with
the
praise
these
are
good
rhymes
he
wrote
a
comedy
a
tragedy
an
epic
poem
all
of
which
he
afterward
destroyed
and
as
he
laughingly
confessed
in
later
years
he
thought
himself
the
greatest
genius
that
ever
was
pope
was
not
alone
however
in
holding
a
high
opinion
of
his
talents
while
still
a
boy
in
his
teens
he
was
taken
up
and
patronized
by
a
number
of
gentlemen
trumbull
walsh
and
cromwell
all
dabblers
in
poetry
and
criticism
he
was
introduced
to
the
dramatist
wycherly
nearly
fifty
years
his
senior
and
helped
to
polish
some
of
the
old
man
verses
his
own
works
were
passed
about
in
manuscript
from
hand
to
hand
till
one
of
them
came
to
the
eyes
of
dryden
old
publisher
tonson
tonson
wrote
pope
a
respectful
letter
asking
for
the
honor
of
being
allowed
to
publish
them
one
may
fancy
the
delight
with
which
the
boy
received
this
offer
it
is
a
proof
of
patience
as
well
as
his
precocity
that
he
delayed
three
years
before
accepting
it
it
was
not
till
that
his
first
published
verses
the
a
fragment
translated
from
homer
and
a
modernized
version
of
one
of
the
tales
appeared
in
tonson
with
the
publication
of
the
pope
embarked
upon
his
life
as
a
man
of
letters
they
seem
to
have
brought
him
a
certain
recognition
but
hardly
fame
that
he
obtained
by
his
next
poem
the
on
criticism
which
appeared
in
it
was
applauded
in
the
and
pope
seems
about
this
time
to
have
made
the
acquaintance
of
addison
and
the
little
senate
which
met
in
button
coffee
house
his
poem
the
appeared
in
the
in
may
the
first
draft
of
rape
of
the
lock
in
a
poetical
miscellany
in
the
same
year
and
addison
request
in
that
he
compose
a
prologue
for
the
tragedy
of
set
the
final
stamp
upon
his
rank
as
a
poet
pope
friendly
relations
with
addison
and
his
circle
were
not
however
long
continued
in
the
year
he
gradually
drew
away
from
them
and
came
under
the
influence
of
swift
then
at
the
height
of
his
power
in
political
and
social
life
swift
introduced
him
to
the
brilliant
tories
politicians
and
lovers
of
letters
harley
bolingbroke
and
atterbury
who
were
then
at
the
head
of
affairs
pope
new
friends
seem
to
have
treated
him
with
a
deference
which
he
had
never
experienced
before
and
which
bound
him
to
them
in
unbroken
affection
harley
used
to
regret
that
pope
religion
rendered
him
legally
incapable
of
holding
a
sinecure
office
in
the
government
such
as
was
frequently
bestowed
in
those
days
upon
men
of
letters
and
swift
jestingly
offered
the
young
poet
twenty
guineas
to
become
a
protestant
but
now
as
later
pope
was
firmly
resolved
not
to
abandon
the
faith
of
his
parents
for
the
sake
of
worldly
advantage
and
in
order
to
secure
the
independence
he
valued
so
highly
he
resolved
to
embark
upon
the
great
work
of
his
life
the
translation
of
homer
what
led
me
into
that
he
told
a
friend
long
after
was
purely
the
want
of
money
i
had
then
none
not
even
to
buy
books
it
seems
that
about
this
time
pope
father
had
experienced
some
heavy
financial
losses
and
the
poet
whose
receipts
in
money
had
so
far
been
by
no
means
in
proportion
to
the
reputation
his
works
had
brought
him
now
resolved
to
use
that
reputation
as
a
means
of
securing
from
the
public
a
sum
which
would
at
least
keep
him
for
life
from
poverty
or
the
necessity
of
begging
for
patronage
it
is
worth
noting
that
pope
was
the
first
englishman
of
letters
who
threw
himself
thus
boldly
upon
the
public
and
earned
his
living
by
his
pen
the
arrangements
for
the
publication
and
sale
of
pope
translation
of
homer
were
made
with
care
and
pushed
on
with
enthusiasm
he
issued
in
his
proposals
for
an
edition
to
be
published
by
subscription
and
his
friends
at
once
became
enthusiastic
canvassers
we
have
a
characteristic
picture
of
swift
at
this
time
bustling
about
a
crowded
and
informing
the
company
that
the
best
poet
in
england
was
pope
a
papist
who
had
begun
a
translation
of
homer
for
which
they
must
all
subscribe
for
says
he
the
author
shall
not
begin
to
print
till
i
have
a
thousand
guineas
for
him
the
work
was
to
be
in
six
volumes
each
costing
a
guinea
pope
obtained
subscribers
many
of
whom
took
more
than
one
set
lintot
the
publisher
gave
pope
for
the
work
and
agreed
to
supply
the
subscription
copies
free
of
charge
as
a
result
pope
made
something
between
and
a
sum
absolutely
unprecedented
in
the
history
of
english
literature
and
amply
sufficient
to
make
him
independent
for
life
but
the
sum
was
honestly
earned
by
hard
and
wearisome
work
pope
was
no
greek
scholar
it
is
said
indeed
that
he
was
just
able
to
make
out
the
sense
of
the
original
with
a
translation
and
in
addition
to
the
fifteen
thousand
lines
of
the
he
had
engaged
to
furnish
an
introduction
and
notes
at
first
the
magnitude
of
the
undertaking
frightened
him
what
terrible
moments
he
said
to
spence
does
one
feel
after
one
has
engaged
for
a
large
work
in
the
beginning
of
my
translating
the
i
wished
anybody
would
hang
me
a
hundred
times
it
sat
so
heavily
on
my
mind
at
first
that
i
often
used
to
dream
of
it
and
do
sometimes
still
in
spite
of
his
discouragement
however
and
of
the
ill
health
which
so
constantly
beset
him
pope
fell
gallantly
upon
his
task
and
as
time
went
on
came
almost
to
enjoy
it
he
used
to
translate
thirty
or
forty
verses
in
the
morning
before
rising
and
in
his
own
characteristic
phrase
piddled
over
them
for
the
rest
of
the
day
he
used
every
assistance
possible
drew
freely
upon
the
scholarship
of
friends
corrected
and
recorrected
with
a
view
to
obtaining
clearness
and
point
and
finally
succeeded
in
producing
a
version
which
not
only
satisfied
his
own
critical
judgment
but
was
at
once
accepted
by
the
world
as
the
standard
translation
of
homer
the
first
volume
came
out
in
june
and
to
pope
dismay
and
wrath
a
rival
translation
appeared
almost
simultaneously
tickell
one
of
addison
little
senate
had
also
begun
a
translation
of
the
and
although
he
announced
in
the
preface
that
he
intended
to
withdraw
in
favor
of
pope
and
take
up
a
translation
of
the
the
suspicions
were
at
once
aroused
and
they
were
quickly
fanned
into
a
flame
by
the
gossip
of
the
town
which
reported
that
addison
the
recognized
authority
in
literary
criticism
pronounced
tickell
version
the
best
that
ever
was
in
any
language
rumor
went
so
far
in
fact
as
to
hint
pretty
broadly
that
addison
himself
was
the
author
in
part
at
least
of
tickell
book
and
pope
who
had
been
encouraged
by
addison
to
begin
his
long
task
felt
at
once
that
he
had
been
betrayed
his
resentment
was
all
the
more
bitter
since
he
fancied
that
addison
now
at
the
height
of
his
power
and
prosperity
in
the
world
of
letters
and
of
politics
had
attempted
to
ruin
an
enterprise
on
which
the
younger
man
had
set
all
his
hopes
of
success
and
independence
for
no
better
reason
than
literary
jealousy
and
political
estrangement
we
know
now
that
pope
was
mistaken
but
there
was
beyond
question
some
reason
at
the
time
for
his
thinking
as
he
did
and
it
is
to
the
bitterness
which
this
incident
caused
in
his
mind
that
we
owe
the
famous
satiric
portrait
of
addison
as
atticus
the
last
volume
of
the
appeared
in
the
spring
of
and
in
it
pope
gave
a
renewed
proof
of
his
independence
by
dedicating
the
whole
work
not
to
some
lord
who
would
have
rewarded
him
with
a
handsome
present
but
to
his
old
acquaintance
congreve
the
last
survivor
of
the
brilliant
comic
dramatists
of
dryden
day
and
now
resting
for
a
time
from
his
long
labors
pope
turned
to
the
adornment
and
cultivation
of
the
little
house
and
garden
that
he
had
leased
at
twickenham
pope
father
had
died
in
and
the
poet
rejecting
politely
but
firmly
the
suggestion
of
his
friend
atterbury
that
he
might
now
turn
protestant
devoted
himself
with
double
tenderness
to
the
care
of
his
aged
and
infirm
mother
he
brought
her
with
him
to
twickenham
where
she
lived
till
dying
in
that
year
at
the
great
age
of
it
may
have
been
partly
on
her
account
that
pope
pitched
upon
twickenham
as
his
abiding
place
beautifully
situated
on
the
banks
of
the
thames
it
was
at
once
a
quiet
country
place
and
yet
of
easy
access
to
london
to
hampton
court
or
to
kew
the
five
acres
of
land
that
lay
about
the
house
furnished
pope
with
inexhaustible
entertainment
for
the
rest
of
his
life
he
twisted
and
twirled
and
harmonized
his
bit
of
ground
till
it
appeared
two
or
three
sweet
little
lawns
opening
and
opening
beyond
one
another
the
whole
surrounded
by
impenetrable
woods
following
the
taste
of
his
times
in
landscape
gardening
he
adorned
his
lawns
with
artificial
mounds
a
shell
temple
an
obelisk
and
a
colonnade
but
the
crowning
glory
was
the
grotto
a
tunnel
decorated
fantastically
with
shells
and
bits
of
which
pope
dug
under
a
road
that
ran
through
his
grounds
here
pope
received
in
state
and
his
house
and
garden
was
for
years
the
center
of
the
most
brilliant
society
in
england
here
swift
came
on
his
rare
visits
from
ireland
and
bolingbroke
on
his
return
from
exile
arbuthnot
pope
beloved
physician
was
a
frequent
visitor
and
peterborough
one
of
the
most
distinguished
of
english
soldiers
condescended
to
help
lay
out
the
garden
congreve
came
too
at
times
and
gay
the
laziest
and
most
of
poets
nor
was
the
society
of
women
lacking
at
these
gatherings
lady
mary
wortley
montague
the
wittiest
woman
in
england
was
often
there
until
her
bitter
quarrel
with
the
poet
the
grim
old
duchess
of
marlborough
appeared
once
or
twice
in
pope
last
years
and
the
princess
of
wales
came
with
her
husband
to
inspire
the
leaders
of
the
opposition
to
the
hated
walpole
and
the
miserly
king
and
from
first
to
last
the
good
angel
of
the
place
was
the
patty
blount
pope
best
and
dearest
friend
not
long
after
the
completion
of
the
pope
undertook
to
edit
shakespeare
and
completed
the
work
in
the
edition
is
of
course
quite
superseded
now
but
it
has
its
place
in
the
history
of
shakespearean
studies
as
the
first
that
made
an
effort
though
irregular
and
incomplete
to
restore
the
true
text
by
collation
and
conjecture
it
has
its
place
too
in
the
story
of
pope
life
since
the
bitter
criticism
which
it
received
all
the
more
unpleasant
to
the
poet
since
it
was
in
the
main
true
was
one
of
the
principal
causes
of
his
writing
the
between
the
publication
of
his
edition
of
shakespeare
however
and
the
appearance
of
the
pope
resolved
to
complete
his
translation
of
homer
and
with
the
assistance
of
a
pair
of
friends
got
out
a
version
of
the
odyssey
in
like
the
this
was
published
by
subscription
and
as
in
the
former
case
the
greatest
men
in
england
were
eager
to
show
their
appreciation
of
the
poet
by
filling
up
his
lists
sir
robert
walpole
the
great
whig
statesman
took
ten
copies
and
harley
the
fallen
tory
leader
put
himself
his
wife
and
his
daughter
down
for
sixteen
pope
made
it
is
said
about
by
this
work
in
swift
visited
pope
and
encouraged
him
to
complete
a
satire
which
he
seems
already
to
have
begun
on
the
dull
critics
and
hack
writers
of
the
day
for
one
cause
or
another
its
publication
was
deferred
until
when
it
appeared
under
the
title
of
the
here
pope
declared
open
war
upon
his
enemies
all
those
who
had
attacked
his
works
abused
his
character
or
scoffed
at
his
personal
deformities
were
caricatured
as
ridiculous
and
sometimes
disgusting
figures
in
a
mock
epic
poem
celebrating
the
accession
of
a
new
monarch
to
the
throne
of
dullness
the
is
little
read
except
by
professed
students
of
english
letters
but
it
made
naturally
enough
a
great
stir
at
the
time
and
vastly
provoked
the
wrath
of
all
the
dunces
whose
names
it
dragged
to
light
pope
has
often
been
blamed
for
stooping
to
such
ignoble
combat
and
in
particular
for
the
coarseness
of
his
abuse
and
for
his
bitter
jests
upon
the
poverty
of
his
opponents
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
no
living
writer
had
been
so
scandalously
abused
as
pope
and
no
writer
that
ever
lived
was
by
nature
so
quick
to
feel
and
to
resent
insult
the
undoubted
coarseness
of
the
work
is
in
part
due
to
the
gross
license
of
the
times
in
speech
and
writing
and
more
particularly
to
the
influence
of
swift
at
this
time
predominant
over
pope
and
in
regard
to
pope
trick
of
taunting
his
enemies
with
poverty
it
must
frankly
be
confessed
that
he
seized
upon
this
charge
as
a
ready
and
telling
weapon
pope
was
at
heart
one
of
the
most
charitable
of
men
in
the
days
of
his
prosperity
he
is
said
to
have
given
away
one
eighth
of
his
income
and
he
was
always
quick
to
succor
merit
in
distress
he
pensioned
the
poet
savage
and
he
tried
to
secure
patronage
for
johnson
but
for
the
wretched
hack
writers
of
the
common
press
who
had
barked
against
him
he
had
no
mercy
and
he
struck
them
with
the
first
rod
that
lay
ready
to
his
hands
during
his
work
on
the
pope
came
into
intimate
relations
with
bolingbroke
who
in
had
returned
from
his
long
exile
in
france
and
had
settled
at
dawley
within
easy
reach
of
pope
villa
at
twickenham
bolingbroke
was
beyond
doubt
one
of
the
most
brilliant
and
stimulating
minds
of
his
age
without
depth
of
intellect
or
solidity
of
character
he
was
at
once
a
philosopher
a
statesman
a
scholar
and
a
fascinating
talker
pope
who
had
already
made
his
acquaintance
was
delighted
to
renew
and
improve
their
intimacy
and
soon
came
wholly
under
the
influence
of
his
splendid
friend
it
is
hardly
too
much
to
say
that
all
the
rest
of
pope
work
is
directly
traceable
to
bolingbroke
the
on
man
was
built
up
on
the
precepts
of
bolingbroke
philosophy
the
of
horace
were
undertaken
at
bolingbroke
suggestion
and
the
whole
tone
of
pope
political
and
social
satire
during
the
years
from
to
reflects
the
spirit
of
that
opposition
to
the
administration
of
walpole
and
to
the
growing
influence
of
the
commercial
class
which
was
at
once
inspired
and
directed
by
bolingbroke
and
yet
it
is
exactly
in
the
work
of
this
period
that
we
find
the
best
and
with
perhaps
one
exception
the
on
man
the
most
original
work
of
pope
he
has
obtained
an
absolute
command
over
his
instrument
of
expression
in
his
hands
the
heroic
couplet
sings
and
laughs
and
chats
and
thunders
he
has
turned
from
the
ignoble
warfare
with
the
dunces
to
satirize
courtly
frivolity
and
wickedness
in
high
places
and
most
important
of
all
to
the
student
of
pope
it
is
in
these
last
works
that
his
personality
is
most
clearly
revealed
it
has
been
well
said
that
the
best
introduction
to
the
study
of
pope
the
man
is
to
get
the
to
arbuthnot
by
heart
pope
gradually
persuaded
himself
that
all
the
works
of
these
years
the
on
man
the
epistles
and
essays
were
but
parts
of
one
stupendous
whole
he
told
spence
in
the
last
years
of
his
life
i
had
once
thought
of
completing
my
ethic
work
in
four
the
first
you
know
is
on
the
nature
of
man
the
on
man
the
second
would
have
been
on
knowledge
and
its
limits
here
would
have
come
in
an
essay
on
education
part
of
which
i
have
inserted
in
the
in
the
fourth
book
published
in
the
third
was
to
have
treated
of
government
both
ecclesiastical
and
civil
and
this
was
what
chiefly
stopped
my
going
on
i
could
not
have
said
what
would
have
said
without
provoking
every
church
on
the
face
of
the
earth
and
i
did
not
care
for
living
always
in
boiling
this
part
would
have
come
into
my
an
epic
poem
which
pope
never
completed
which
is
planned
already
the
fourth
would
have
been
on
morality
in
eight
or
nine
of
the
most
concerning
branches
of
it
it
is
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
believe
that
pope
with
his
irregular
methods
of
work
and
illogical
habit
of
thought
had
planned
so
vast
and
elaborate
a
system
before
he
began
its
execution
it
is
far
more
likely
that
he
followed
his
old
method
of
composing
on
the
inspiration
of
the
moment
and
produced
the
works
in
question
with
little
thought
of
their
relation
or
interdependence
but
in
the
last
years
of
his
life
when
he
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
warburton
and
was
engaged
in
reviewing
and
perfecting
the
works
of
this
period
he
noticed
their
general
similarity
in
form
and
spirit
and
possibly
under
warburton
influence
conceived
the
notion
of
combining
and
supplementing
them
to
form
that
greater
essay
on
man
of
which
he
spoke
to
spence
and
of
which
warburton
himself
has
given
us
a
detailed
account
warburton
a
pompous
and
polemical
clergyman
had
introduced
himself
to
the
notice
of
pope
by
a
defense
of
the
philosophical
and
religious
principles
of
the
on
man
in
spite
of
the
influence
of
the
bolingbroke
pope
still
remained
a
member
of
the
catholic
church
and
sincerely
believed
himself
to
be
an
orthodox
though
liberal
christian
and
he
had
in
consequence
been
greatly
disconcerted
by
a
criticism
of
his
poem
published
in
switzerland
and
lately
translated
into
english
its
author
pierre
de
crousaz
maintained
and
with
a
considerable
degree
of
truth
that
the
principles
of
pope
poem
if
pushed
to
their
logical
conclusion
were
destructive
to
religion
and
would
rank
their
author
rather
among
atheists
than
defenders
of
the
faith
the
very
word
atheist
was
at
that
day
sufficient
to
put
the
man
to
whom
it
was
applied
beyond
the
pale
of
polite
society
and
pope
who
quite
lacked
the
ability
to
refute
in
logical
argument
the
attack
of
de
crousaz
was
proportionately
delighted
when
warburton
came
forward
in
his
defense
and
in
a
series
of
letters
asserted
that
pope
whole
intention
was
to
vindicate
the
ways
of
god
to
man
and
that
de
crousaz
had
mistaken
his
purpose
and
misunderstood
his
language
pope
gratitude
to
his
defender
knew
no
bounds
he
declared
that
warburton
understood
the
better
than
he
did
himself
he
pronounced
him
the
greatest
critic
he
ever
knew
secured
an
introduction
to
him
introduced
him
to
his
own
rich
and
influential
friends
in
short
made
the
man
fortune
for
him
outright
when
the
university
of
oxford
hesitated
to
give
warburton
who
had
never
attended
a
university
the
degree
of
pope
declined
to
accept
the
degree
of
which
had
been
offered
him
at
the
same
time
and
wrote
the
fourth
book
of
the
to
satirize
the
stupidity
of
the
university
authorities
in
conjunction
with
warburton
he
proceeded
further
to
revise
the
whole
poem
for
which
his
new
friend
wrote
notes
and
a
ponderous
introduction
and
made
the
capital
mistake
of
substituting
the
frivolous
but
clever
colley
gibber
with
whom
he
had
recently
become
embroiled
for
his
old
enemy
theobald
as
the
hero
and
the
last
year
of
his
life
was
spent
in
getting
out
new
editions
of
his
poems
accompanied
by
elaborate
commentaries
from
the
pen
of
warburton
in
the
spring
of
it
was
evident
that
pope
was
failing
fast
in
addition
to
his
other
ailments
he
was
now
attacked
by
an
asthmatical
dropsy
which
no
efforts
of
his
physicians
could
remove
yet
he
continued
to
work
almost
to
the
last
and
distributed
copies
of
his
epistles
to
his
friends
about
three
weeks
before
his
death
with
the
smiling
remark
that
like
the
dying
socrates
he
was
dispensing
his
morality
among
his
friends
his
mind
began
to
wander
he
complained
that
he
saw
all
things
as
through
a
curtain
and
told
spence
once
with
a
smile
of
great
pleasure
and
with
the
greatest
softness
that
he
had
seen
a
vision
his
friends
were
devoted
in
their
attendance
bolingbroke
sat
weeping
by
his
chair
and
on
spence
remarking
how
pope
with
every
rally
was
always
saying
something
kindly
of
his
friends
replied
i
never
in
my
life
knew
a
man
that
had
so
tender
a
heart
for
his
particular
friends
or
a
more
general
friendship
for
mankind
i
have
known
him
these
thirty
years
and
value
myself
more
for
that
man
love
than
here
his
head
dropped
and
his
voice
broke
in
tears
it
was
noticed
that
whenever
patty
blount
came
into
the
room
the
dying
flame
of
life
flashed
up
in
a
momentary
glow
at
the
very
end
a
friend
reminded
pope
that
as
a
professed
catholic
he
ought
to
send
for
a
priest
the
dying
man
replied
that
he
did
not
believe
it
essential
but
thanked
him
for
the
suggestion
when
the
priest
appeared
pope
attempted
to
rise
from
his
bed
that
he
might
receive
the
sacrament
kneeling
and
the
priest
came
out
from
the
sick
room
penetrated
to
the
last
degree
with
the
state
of
mind
in
which
he
found
his
penitent
resigned
and
wrapt
up
in
the
love
of
god
and
man
the
hope
that
sustained
pope
to
the
end
was
that
of
immortality
i
am
so
certain
of
the
soul
being
immortal
he
whispered
almost
with
his
last
breath
that
i
seem
to
feel
it
within
me
as
it
were
by
intuition
he
died
on
the
evening
of
may
so
quietly
that
his
friends
hardly
knew
that
the
end
had
come
he
was
buried
in
twickenham
church
near
the
monument
he
had
erected
to
his
parents
and
his
coffin
was
carried
to
the
grave
by
six
of
the
poorest
men
of
the
parish
it
is
plain
even
from
so
slight
a
sketch
as
this
that
the
common
conception
of
pope
as
the
wicked
wasp
of
twickenham
a
bitter
jealous
and
malignant
spirit
is
utterly
out
of
accord
with
the
facts
of
his
life
pope
faults
of
character
lie
on
the
surface
and
the
most
perceptible
is
that
which
has
done
him
most
harm
in
the
eyes
of
men
he
was
by
nature
perhaps
by
training
also
untruthful
if
he
seldom
stooped
to
an
outright
lie
he
never
hesitated
to
equivocate
and
students
of
his
life
have
found
that
it
is
seldom
possible
to
take
his
word
on
any
point
where
his
own
works
or
interests
were
concerned
i
have
already
x
attempted
to
point
out
the
probable
cause
of
this
defect
and
it
is
moreover
worth
while
to
remark
that
pope
manifold
intrigues
and
evasions
were
mainly
of
the
defensive
order
he
plotted
and
quibbled
not
so
much
to
injure
others
as
to
protect
himself
to
charge
pope
with
treachery
to
his
friends
as
has
sometimes
been
done
is
wholly
to
misunderstand
his
character
another
flaw
one
can
hardly
call
it
a
vice
in
pope
character
was
his
constant
practice
of
considering
everything
that
came
in
his
way
as
copy
it
was
this
which
led
him
to
reclaim
his
early
letters
from
his
friends
to
alter
rewrite
and
redate
them
utterly
unconscious
of
the
trouble
which
he
was
preparing
for
his
future
biographers
the
letters
he
thought
were
good
reading
but
not
so
good
as
he
could
make
them
and
he
set
to
work
to
improve
them
with
all
an
artist
zeal
and
without
a
trace
of
a
historian
care
for
facts
it
was
this
which
led
him
to
embody
in
his
description
of
a
rich
fool
splendid
house
and
park
certain
unmistakable
traces
of
a
living
nobleman
estate
and
to
start
in
genuine
amazement
and
regret
when
the
world
insisted
on
identifying
the
nobleman
and
the
fool
and
when
pope
had
once
done
a
good
piece
of
work
he
had
all
an
artist
reluctance
to
destroy
it
he
kept
bits
of
verse
by
him
for
years
and
inserted
them
into
appropriate
places
in
his
poems
this
habit
it
was
that
brought
about
perhaps
the
gravest
charge
that
has
ever
been
made
against
pope
that
of
accepting
to
suppress
a
satiric
portrait
of
the
old
duchess
of
marlborough
and
yet
of
publishing
it
in
a
revision
of
a
poem
that
he
was
engaged
on
just
before
his
death
the
truth
seems
to
be
that
pope
had
drawn
this
portrait
in
days
when
he
was
at
bitter
enmity
with
the
duchess
and
after
the
reconcilement
that
took
place
unwilling
to
suppress
it
entirely
had
worked
it
over
and
added
passages
out
of
keeping
with
the
first
design
but
pointing
to
another
lady
with
whom
he
was
now
at
odds
pope
behavior
we
must
admit
was
not
altogether
creditable
but
it
was
that
of
an
artist
reluctant
to
throw
away
good
work
not
that
of
a
ruffian
who
stabs
a
woman
he
has
taken
money
to
spare
finally
pope
was
throughout
his
life
and
notably
in
his
later
years
the
victim
of
an
irritable
temper
and
a
quick
abusive
tongue
his
irritability
sprang
in
part
we
may
believe
from
his
physical
sufferings
even
more
however
from
the
exquisitely
sensitive
heart
which
made
him
feel
a
coarse
insult
as
others
would
a
blow
and
of
the
coarseness
of
the
insults
that
were
heaped
upon
pope
no
one
except
the
careful
student
of
his
life
can
have
any
conception
his
genius
his
morals
his
person
his
parents
and
his
religion
were
overwhelmed
in
one
indiscriminate
flood
of
abuse
too
high
spirited
to
submit
tamely
to
these
attacks
too
irritable
to
laugh
at
them
he
struck
back
and
his
weapon
was
personal
satire
which
cut
like
a
whip
and
left
a
brand
like
a
hot
iron
and
if
at
times
as
in
the
case
of
addison
pope
was
mistaken
in
his
object
and
assaulted
one
who
was
in
no
sense
his
enemy
the
fault
lies
not
so
much
in
his
alleged
malice
as
in
the
unhappy
state
of
warfare
in
which
he
lived
over
against
the
faults
of
pope
we
may
set
more
than
one
noble
characteristic
the
sensitive
heart
and
impulsive
temper
that
led
him
so
often
into
bitter
warfare
made
him
also
most
susceptible
to
kindness
and
quick
to
pity
suffering
he
was
essentially
of
a
tender
and
loving
nature
a
devoted
son
and
a
loyal
friend
unwearied
in
acts
of
kindness
and
generosity
his
ruling
passion
to
use
his
own
phrase
was
a
devotion
to
letters
and
he
determined
as
early
and
worked
as
diligently
to
make
himself
a
poet
as
ever
milton
did
his
wretched
body
was
dominated
by
a
high
and
eager
mind
and
he
combined
in
an
unparalleled
degree
the
fiery
energy
of
the
born
poet
with
the
tireless
patience
of
the
trained
artist
but
perhaps
the
most
remarkable
characteristic
of
pope
is
his
manly
independence
in
an
age
when
almost
without
exception
his
stooped
to
accept
a
great
man
patronage
or
sold
their
talents
into
the
slavery
of
politics
pope
stood
aloof
from
patron
and
from
party
he
repeatedly
declined
offers
of
money
that
were
made
him
even
when
no
condition
was
attached
he
refused
to
change
his
religion
though
he
was
far
from
being
a
devout
catholic
in
order
to
secure
a
comfortable
place
he
relied
upon
his
genius
alone
for
his
support
and
his
genius
gave
him
all
that
he
asked
a
modest
competency
his
relations
with
his
rich
and
powerful
friends
were
marked
by
the
same
independent
spirit
he
never
cringed
or
flattered
but
met
them
on
even
terms
and
raised
himself
by
merit
alone
from
his
position
as
the
unknown
son
of
an
humble
shopkeeper
to
be
the
friend
and
associate
of
the
greatest
fortunes
and
most
powerful
minds
in
england
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
the
career
of
a
man
of
letters
as
we
know
it
a
career
at
once
honorable
and
independent
takes
its
rise
from
the
life
and
work
of
alexander
pope
the
long
controversies
that
have
raged
about
pope
rank
as
a
poet
seem
at
last
to
be
drawing
to
a
close
and
it
has
become
possible
to
strike
a
balance
between
the
exaggerated
praise
of
his
contemporaries
and
the
reckless
depreciation
of
romantic
critics
that
he
is
not
a
poet
of
the
first
order
is
plain
if
for
no
other
reason
than
that
he
never
produced
a
work
in
any
of
the
greatest
forms
of
poetry
the
drama
the
epic
the
lyric
were
all
outside
his
range
on
the
other
hand
unless
a
definition
of
poetry
be
framed
and
johnson
has
well
remarked
that
to
circumscribe
poetry
by
a
definition
will
only
show
the
narrowness
of
the
definer
which
shall
exclude
all
gnomic
and
satiric
verse
and
so
debar
the
claims
of
hesiod
juvenal
and
boileau
it
is
impossible
to
deny
that
pope
is
a
true
poet
certain
qualities
of
the
highest
poet
pope
no
doubt
lacked
lofty
imagination
intense
passion
wide
human
sympathy
but
within
the
narrow
field
which
he
marked
out
for
his
own
he
approaches
perfection
as
nearly
as
any
english
poet
and
pope
merit
consists
not
merely
in
the
smoothness
of
his
verse
or
the
polish
of
separate
epigrams
as
is
so
often
stated
but
quite
as
much
in
the
vigor
of
his
conceptions
and
the
unity
and
careful
proportion
of
each
poem
as
a
whole
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
rape
of
the
lock
is
one
of
the
poems
in
any
language
it
is
as
symmetrical
and
exquisitely
finished
as
a
grecian
temple
historically
pope
represents
the
fullest
embodiment
of
that
spirit
which
began
to
appear
in
english
literature
about
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
and
which
we
are
accustomed
to
call
the
classical
spirit
in
essence
this
movement
was
a
protest
against
the
irregularity
and
individual
license
of
earlier
poets
instead
of
wit
and
fanciful
diction
the
classical
school
erected
the
standards
of
common
sense
in
conception
and
directness
in
expression
and
in
so
doing
they
restored
poetry
which
had
become
the
diversion
of
the
few
to
the
possession
of
the
many
pope
for
example
is
preeminently
the
poet
of
his
time
he
dealt
with
topics
that
were
of
general
interest
to
the
society
in
which
he
lived
he
pictured
life
as
he
saw
it
about
him
and
this
accounts
for
his
prompt
and
general
acceptance
by
the
world
of
his
day
for
the
student
of
english
literature
pope
work
has
a
threefold
value
it
represents
the
highest
achievement
of
one
of
the
great
movements
in
the
developments
of
english
verse
it
reflects
with
unerring
accuracy
the
life
and
thought
of
his
time
not
merely
the
outward
life
of
beau
and
belle
in
the
days
of
queen
anne
but
the
ideals
of
the
age
in
art
philosophy
and
politics
and
finally
it
teaches
as
hardly
any
other
body
of
english
verse
can
be
said
to
do
the
perennial
value
of
conscious
and
controlling
art
pope

is

it
will
be
in

to

that
i
have
some
regard
for
this
piece
since
i
dedicate
it
to
you
yet
you
may
bear
me
witness
it
was
intended
only
to
divert
a
few
young
ladies
who
have
good
sense
and
good
humour
enough
to
laugh
not
only
at
their
sex
little
unguarded
follies
but
at
their
own
but
as
it
was
communicated
with
the
air
of
a
secret
it
soon
found
its
way
into
the
world
an
imperfect
copy
having
been
offer
to
a
bookseller
you
had
the
for
my
sake
to
consent
to
the
publication
of

more
correct
this
i
was
forc
to
before
i
had
executed
half
my
design
for
the
machinery
was
entirely
wanting
to
compleat
it
the
machinery
madam
is
a
term
invented
by
the
critics
to
signify
that
part
which
the
deities
angels
or
dæmons
are
made
to
act
in
a
poem
for
the
ancient
poets
are
in
one
respect
like
many
modern
ladies
let
an
action
be
never
so
trivial
in
itself
they
always
make
it
appear
of
the
utmost
importance
these
machines
i
determined
to
raise
on
a
very
new
and
odd
foundation
the
rosicrucian
doctrine
of
spirits
i
know
how
disagreeable
it
is
to
make
use
of
hard
words
before
a
lady
is
so
much
the
concern
of
a
poet
to
have
his
works
understood
and
particularly
by
your
sex
that
you
must
give
me
leave
to
explain
two
or
three
difficult
terms
the
rosicrucians
are
a
people
i
must
bring
you
acquainted
with
the
best
account
i
know
of
them
is
in
a
french
book
call
comte
de
gabalis
which
both
in
its
title
and
size
is
so
like
a
novel
that
many
of
the
fair
sex
have
read
it
for
one
by
mistake
according
to
these
gentlemen
the
four
elements
are
inhabited
by
spirits
which
they
call
sylphs
gnomes
nymphs
and
salamanders
the
gnomes
or
dæmons
of
earth
delight
in
mischief
but
the
sylphs
whose
habitation
is
in
the
air
are
the
creatures
imaginable
for
they
say
any
mortals
may
enjoy
the
most
intimate
familiarities
with
these
gentle
spirits
upon
a
condition
very
easy
to
all
true
adepts
an
inviolate
preservation
of
chastity
as
to
the
following
canto
all
the
passages
of
them
are
as
fabulous
as
the
vision
at
the
beginning
or
the
transformation
at
the
end
except
the
loss
of
your
hair
which
i
always
mention
with
reverence
the
human
persons
are
as
fictitious
as
the
airy
ones
and
the
character
of
belinda
as
it
is
now
manag
resembles
you
in
nothing
but
in
beauty
if
this
poem
had
as
many
graces
as
there
are
in
your
person
or
in
your
mind
yet
i
could
never
hope
it
should
pass
thro
the
world
half
so
uncensur
as
you
have
done
but
let
its
fortune
be
what
it
will
mine
is
happy
enough
to
have
given
me
this
occasion
of
assuring
you
that
i
am
with
the
truest
esteem
madam
your
most
obedient
humble

what

conclusion
an
essay
on
criticism
is
hard
to
say
if
greater
want
of
skill
appear
in
writing
or
in
judging
ill
but
of
the
two
less
is
th
offence
to
tire
our
patience
than
mislead
our
sense
some
few
in
that
but
numbers
err
in
this
ten
censure
wrong
for
one
who
writes
amiss
a
fool
might
once
himself
alone
expose
now
one
in
verse
makes
many
more
in
prose
is
with
our
judgments
as
our
watches
none
go
just
alike
yet
each
believes
his
own
in
poets
as
true
genius
is
but
rare
true
taste
as
seldom
is
the
critic
share
both
must
alike
from
derive
their
light
these
born
to
judge
as
well
as
those
to
write
let
such
teach
others
who
themselves
excel
and
censure
freely
who
have
written
well
authors
are
partial
to
their
wit
is
true
but
are
not
critics
to
their
judgment
too
yet
if
we
look
more
closely
we
shall
find
most
have
the
seeds
of
judgment
in
their
mind
nature
affords
at
least
a
light
the
lines
tho
touch
but
faintly
are
drawn
right
but
as
the
slightest
sketch
if
justly
trac
is
by
but
the
more
disgrac
so
by
false
learning
is
good
sense
defac
some
are
bewilder
in
the
maze
of
schools
and
some
made
coxcombs
nature
meant
but
fools
in
search
of
wit
these
lose
their
common
sense
and
then
turn
critics
in
their
own
defence
each
burns
alike
who
can
or
can
not
write
or
with
a
rival
or
an
eunuch
spite
all
fools
have
still
an
itching
to
deride
and
fain
would
be
upon
the
laughing
side
if
mævius
scribble
in
apollo
spite
there
are
who
judge
still
worse
than
he
can
write
some
have
at
first
for
wits
then
poets
past
turn
critics
next
and
prov
plain
fools
at
last
some
neither
can
for
wits
nor
critics
pass
as
heavy
mules
are
neither
horse
nor
ass
those
witlings
in
our
isle
as
insects
on
the
banks
of
nile
unfinish
things
one
knows
not
what
to
call
their
generation
so
equivocal
to
tell
would
a
hundred
tongues
require
or
one
vain
wit
that
might
a
hundred
tire
but
you
who
seek
to
give
and
merit
fame
and
justly
bear
a
critic
noble
name
be
sure
yourself
and
your
own
reach
to
know
how
far
your
genius
taste
and
learning
go
launch
not
beyond
your
depth
but
be
discreet
and
mark
that
point
where
sense
and
dulness
meet
nature
to
all
things
fix
the
limits
fit
and
wisely
curb
proud
man
pretending
wit
as
on
the
land
while
here
the
ocean
gains
in
other
parts
it
leaves
wide
sandy
plains
thus
in
the
soul
while
memory
prevails
the
solid
of
understanding
fails
where
beams
of
warm
imagination
play
the
memory
soft
figures
melt
away
one
science
only
will
one
genius
fit
so
vast
is
art
so
narrow
human
wit
not
only
bounded
to
peculiar
arts
but
oft
in
those
confin
to
single
parts
like
kings
we
lose
the
conquests
gain
before
by
vain
ambition
still
to
make
them
more
each
might
his
province
well
command
would
all
but
stoop
to
what
they
understand
first
follow
nature
and
your
judgment
frame
by
her
just
standard
which
is
still
the
same
unerring
nature
still
divinely
bright
one
clear
unchang
and
universal
light
life
force
and
beauty

to
all
impart
at
once
the
source
and

art
from
that

each
just

without

without

fair
body
thus
th
informing
soul
with
spirits
feeds
with
vigour
fills
the
whole
each
motion
guides
and
nerve
sustains
itself
unseen
but
in
th
effects
remains
some
to
whom
in
wit
has
been
profuse
want
as
much
more
to
turn
it
to
its
use
for
wit
and
judgment
often
are
at
strife
tho

each

thus

out

great
wits
sometimes
may
gloriously
offend

rise
to
faults
true
critics
dare
not
mend
but
tho
the
ancients
thus
their
rules
invade
as
kings
dispense
with
laws
themselves
have
made
moderns
beware
or
if
you
must
offend
against
the
precept
transgress
its
end
let
it
be
seldom
and
compell
by
need
and
have
at

their

without

critics
of

curious
not

not

nice
form
short
ideas
and
offend
in

nothing

what
oft

so
well
express
something
whose

convinc
at
sight
we
find
that
gives
us
back
the
image
of
our

as
shades

so
modest

sprightly
wit

all
their

express

books
as
women
men
for

their
praise
is
still
the
style
is
excellent
the
sense
they
humbly
take
upon

words
are
like

where
they
most
abound
much
fruit
of

beneath
is
rarely
found
false
eloquence
like

without

it
shines

it
alters
none
expression
is
the

still

more

a

is

some

in

such

nothings
in
so
strange
a

amaze
th

make

smile
unlucky
as

in
the

these
sparks
with
awkward
vanity
display
what
the
fine

wore

so
mimic
ancient
wits
at
best
as
apes
our
grandsires
in

doublets
drest
in

the

will
hold
alike
fantastic

be
not
the

by

are

the

to

aside

most
by

judge
a
poet
song
and
smooth
or
rough
with
them
is
right
or
wrong
in
the
bright
muse
though
thousand
charms
conspire
her
voice
is
all
these
tuneful
fools
admire
who
haunt
parnassus
but
to
please
their
ear
not
mend
their
minds
as
some
to
church
repair
not
for
the
doctrine
but
the
music
there
these
equal
syllables
alone
require
tho
oft
the
ear
the
open
vowe
tire
while
expletives
their
feeble
aid
do
join
and
ten
low
words
oft
creep
in
one
dull
line
while
they
ring
round
the
same
unvary
chimes
with
sure
returns
of
still
expected
rhymes
you
find
the
cooling
western
breeze
in
the
next
line
it
whispers
through
the
trees
if
crystal
streams
with
pleasing
murmurs
creep
the
reader
threaten
not
in
vain
with
sleep
then
at
the
last
and
only
couplet
fraught
with
some
unmeaning
thing
they
call
a
thought
a
needless
alexandrine
ends
the
song
that
like
a
wounded
snake
drags
its
slow
length
along
leave
such
to
tune
their
own
dull
rhymes
and
know
what
roundly
smooth
or
languishingly
slow
and
praise
the
easy
vigour
of
a
line
where
denham
strength
and
waller
sweetness
join
true
ease
in
writing
comes
from
art
not
chance
as
those
move
easiest
who
have
learn
to
dance
is
not
enough
no
harshness
gives
offence
the
sound
must
seem
an
echo
to
the
sense
soft
is
the
strain
when
zephyr
gently
blows
and
the
smooth
stream
in
smoother
numbers
flows
but
when
loud
surges
lash
the
sounding
shore
the
hoarse
rough
verse
should
like
the
torrent
roar
when
ajax
strives
some
rock
vast
weight
to
throw
the
line
too
labours
and
the
words
move
slow
not
so
when
swift
camilla
scours
the
plain
flies
th
unbending
corn
and
skims
along
the
main
hear
how
timotheus
varied
lays
surprize
and
bid
alternate
passions
fall
and
rise
while
at
each
change
the
son
of
libyan
jove
now
burns
with
glory
and
then
melts
with
love
now
his
fierce
eyes
with
sparkling
fury
glow
now
sighs
steal
out
and
tears
begin
to
flow
persians
and
greeks
like
turns
of
nature
found
and
the
world
victor
stood
subdu
by
sound
the
of
music
all
our
hearts
allow
and
what
timotheus
was
is
dryden
now
avoid
extremes
and
shun
the
fault
of
such
who
still
are
pleas
too
little
or
too
much
at
trifle
scorn
to
take
offence
that
always
shows
great
pride
or
little
sense
those
heads
as
stomachs
are
not
sure
the
best
which
nauseate
all
and
nothing
can
digest
yet
let
not
each
gay
turn
thy
rapture
move
for
fools
admire
but
men
of
sense
approve
as
things
seem
large
which
we
thro
mists
descry
dulness
is
ever
apt
to
magnify
some
foreign
writers
some
our
own
despise
the
ancients
only
or
the
moderns
prize
thus
wit
like
faith
by
each
man
is
to
one
small
sect
and
all
are
damn
beside
meanly
they
seek
the
blessing
to
confine
and
force
that
sun
but
on
a
part
to
shine
which
not
alone
the
southern
wit
sublimes
but
ripens
spirits
in
cold
northern
climes
which
from
the
first
has
shone
on
ages
past
enlights
the
present
and
shall
warm
the
last
tho
each
may
feel
increases
and
decays
and
see
now
clearer
and
now
darker
days
regard
not
then
if
wit
be
old
or
new
but
blame
the
false
and
value
still
the
true
some
advance
a
judgment
of
their
own
but
catch
the
spreading
notion
of
the
town
they
reason
and
conclude
by
precedent
and
own
stale
nonsense
which
they
invent
some
judge
of
author
names
not
works
and
then
nor
praise
nor
blame
the
writings
but
the
men
of
all
this
servile
herd
the
worst
is
he
that
in
proud
dulness
joins
with
quality
a
constant
critic
at
the
great
man
board
to
fetch
and
carry
nonsense
for
my
lord
what
woful
stuff
this
madrigal
would
be
in
some
starv
hackney
sonneteer
or
me
but
let
a
lord
once
own
the
happy
lines
how
the
wit
brightens
how
the
style
refines
before
his
sacred
name
flies
fault
and
each
exalted
stanza
teems
with
thought
the
vulgar
thus
through
imitation
err
as
oft
the
learn
by
being
singular
so
much
they
scorn
the
crowd
that
if
the
throng
by
chance
go
right
they
purposely
go
wrong
so
schismatics
the
plain
believers
quit
and
are
but
damn
for
having
too
much
wit
some
praise
at
morning
what
they
blame
at
night
but
always
think
the
last
opinion
right
a
muse
by
these
is
like
a
mistress
us
this
hour
she
idoliz
the
next
abus
while
their
weak
heads
like
towns
unfortify
sense
and
nonsense
daily
change
their
side
ask
them
the
cause
they
wiser
still
they
say
and
still
wiser
than
we
think
our
fathers
fools
so
wise
we
grow
our
wiser
sons
no
doubt
will
think
us
so
once
this

all
seem
made
to
be
disputed
and
none
had

enough
to
be
confuted
scotists

now
in
peace
remain
amidst
their
kindred
cobwebs
in
if
faith
itself
has
dresses
worn
what
wonder
modes
in
wit
should
take
their
turn
oft
leaving
what
is
natural
and
fit
the
current
folly
proves
the

and

think
their

safe
which

just
to

betimes
no

now
that
golden
age
appears
when

our

such

when
the

where
a

leaps
out
at

upon

when
mellowing
years
their
full
perfection
give
and
each
bold

just
begins
to
live
the
colours

all

fades
away
unhappy

like
most
mistaken
things
atones
not
for

envy
which
it

in

its
empty

soon
the
vanity
is
lost
like
some

the
early
spring

gaily
blooms

in

what

this

with

sure
some

never
all

what
the

by

hated

by

undone
if

to

an
essay
on

to
john
lord
bolingbroke
the
design
having
proposed
to
write
some
pieces
on
human
life
and
manners
such
as
to
use
my
lord
bacon
expression
home
to
men
business
and
i
thought
it
more
satisfactory
to
begin
with
considering
in
the
abstract
his
and
his
since
to
prove
any
moral
duty
to
enforce
any
moral
precept
or
to
examine
the
perfection
or
imperfection
of
any
creature
whatsoever
it
is
necessary
first
to
know
what
and
it
is
placed
in
and
what
is
the
proper
end
and
purpose
of
its
the
science
of
human
nature
is
like
all
other
sciences
reduced
to
a
clear
there
are
not
certain
in
this
world
it
is
therefore
in
the
anatomy
of
the
mind
as
in
that
of
the
body
more
good
will
accrue
to
mankind
by
attending
to
the
large
open
and
perceptible
parts
than
by
studying
too
much
such
finer
nerves
and
vessels
the
conformations
and
uses
of
which
will
for
ever
escape
our
observation
the
are
all
upon
these
last
and
i
will
venture
to
say
they
have
less
sharpened
the
than
the
of
men
against
each
other
and
have
diminished
the
practice
more
than
advanced
the
theory
of
morality
if
i
could
flatter
myself
that
this
essay
has
any
merit
it
is
in
steering
betwixt
the
extremes
of
doctrines
seemingly
opposite
in
passing
over
terms
utterly
unintelligible
and
in
forming
a
yet
not
and
a
yet
not
system
of
ethics
this
i
might
have
done
in
prose
but
i
chose
verse
and
even
rhyme
for
two
reasons
the
one
will
appear
obvious
that
principles
maxims
or
precepts
so
written
both
strike
the
reader
more
strongly
at
first
and
are
more
easily
retained
by
him
afterwards
the
other
may
seem
odd
but
is
true
i
found
i
could
express
them
more
this
way
than
in
prose
itself
and
nothing
is
more
certain
than
that
much
of
the
as
well
as
of
arguments
or
instructions
depends
on
their
i
was
unable
to
treat
this
part
of
my
subject
more
in
without
becoming
dry
and
tedious
or
more
without
sacrificing
perspicuity
to
ornament
without
wandring
from
the
precision
or
breaking
the
chain
of
reasoning
if
any
man
can
unite
all
these
without
diminution
of
any
of
them
i
freely
confess
he
will
compass
a
thing
above
my
capacity
what
is
now
published
is
only
to
be
considered
as
a

man

no
more

the

leaving
the
particular

be
more
fully

which

consequently
these
epistles
in
their
progress
if
i
have
health
and
leisure
to
make
any
progress
will
be
less
dry
and
more
susceptible
of
poetical
ornament
i
am
here
only
opening
the

clearing
the

epistle
to

advertisement
to
the
first
publication
of
this
this
paper
is
a
sort
of
bill
of
complaint
begun
many
years
since
and
drawn
up
by
snatches
as
the
several
occasions
offered
i
had
no
thoughts
of
publishing
it
till
it
pleased
some
persons
of
rank
and
fortune
the
authors
of
to
the
imitator
of
and
of
an
to
a
doctor
of
divinity
from
a
nobleman
at
hampton
to
attack
in
a
very
extraordinary
manner
not
only
my
writings
of
which
being
public
the
public
is
judge
but
my
and
whereof
to
those
who
know
me
not
a
truer
information
may
be
requisite
being
divided
between
the
necessity
to
say
something
of
and
my
own
laziness
to
undertake
so
awkward
a
task
i
thought
it
the
shortest
way
to
put
the
last
hand
to
this
epistle
if
it
have
any
thing
pleasing
it
will
be
that
by
which
i
am
most
desirous
to
please
the
and
the
and
if
any
thing
offensive
it
will
be
only
to
those
i
am
least
sorry
to
offend
or
many
will
know
their
own
pictures
in
it
there
being
not
a
circumstance
but
what
is
true
but
i
have
for
the
most
part
spared
their
and
they
may
escape
being
laughed
at
if
they
please
i
would
have
some
of
them
know
it
was
owing
to
the
request
of
the
learned
and
candid
friend
to
whom
it
is
inscribed
that
i
make
not
as
free
use
of
theirs
as
they
have
done
of
mine
however
i
shall
have
this
advantage
and
honour
on
my
side
that
whereas
by
their
proceeding
any
abuse
may
be
directed
at
any
man
no
injury
can
possibly
be
done
by
mine
since
a
nameless
character
can
never
be
found
out

notes
the
rape
of

introduction
in
pope
who
had
just
published
his
on
criticism
was
looking
about
for
new
worlds
to
conquer
a
fortunate
chance
threw
in
his
way
a
subject
exactly
suited
to
his
tastes
and
powers
he
seized
upon
it
dashed
off
his
first
sketch
in
less
than
a
fortnight
and
published
it
anonymously
in
a
issued
by
lintot
in
but
the
theme
had
taken
firm
root
in
his
mind
dissatisfied
with
his
first
treatment
of
it
he
determined
against
the
advice
of
the
best
critic
of
the
day
to
recast
the
work
and
lift
it
from
a
mere
society
into
an
elaborate
poem
he
did
so
and
won
a
complete
success
even
yet
however
he
was
not
completely
satisfied
and
from
time
to
time
he
added
a
touch
to
his
work
until
he
finally
produced
the
finished
picture
which
we
know
as
rape
of
the
lock
as
it
stands
it
is
an
almost
flawless
masterpiece
a
brilliant
picture
and
mockery
of
the
gay
society
of
queen
anne
day
on
the
whole
the
most
satisfactory
creation
of
pope
genius
and
perhaps
the
best
example
of
the
in
any
literature
the
occasion
which
gave
rise
to
rape
of
the
lock
has
been
so
often
related
that
it
requires
only
a
brief
restatement
among
the
catholic
families
of
queen
anne
day
who
formed
a
little
society
of
their
own
miss
arabella
fermor
was
a
reigning
belle
in
a
youthful
frolic
which
overstepped
the
bounds
of
propriety
lord
petre
a
young
nobleman
of
her
acquaintance
cut
off
a
lock
of
her
hair
the
lady
was
offended
the
two
families
took
up
the
quarrel
a
lasting
estrangement
possibly
even
a
duel
was
threatened
at
this
juncture
a
common
friend
of
the
two
families
a
caryll
nephew
of
a
jacobite
exile
for
whom
he
is
sometimes
mistaken
suggested
to
pope
to
write
a
poem
to
make
a
jest
of
it
and
so
kill
the
quarrel
with
laughter
pope
consented
wrote
his
first
draft
of
rape
of
the
lock
and
passed
it
about
in
manuscript
pope
says
himself
that
it
had
its
effect
in
the
two
families
certainly
nothing
more
is
heard
of
the
feud
how
miss
fermor
received
the
poem
is
a
little
uncertain
pope
complains
in
a
letter
written
some
months
after
the
poem
had
appeared
in
print
that
the
celebrated
lady
is
offended
according
to
johnson
she
liked
the
verses
well
enough
to
show
them
to
her
friends
and
a
niece
of
hers
said
years
afterward
that
pope
praise
had
made
her
aunt
very
troublesome
and
conceited
it
is
not
improbable
that
belinda
was
both
flattered
and
offended
delighted
with
the
praise
of
her
beauty
she
may
none
the
less
have
felt
called
upon
to
play
the
part
of
the
offended
lady
when
the
poem
got
about
and
the
ribald
wits
of
the
day
began
to
read
into
it
double
meanings
which
reflected
upon
her
reputation
to
soothe
her
ruffled
feelings
pope
dedicated
the
second
edition
of
the
poem
to
her
in
a
delightful
letter
in
which
he
thanked
her
for
having
permitted
the
publication
of
the
first
edition
to
forestall
an
imperfect
copy
offered
to
a
bookseller
declared
that
the
character
of
belinda
resembled
her
in
nothing
but
in
beauty
and
affirmed
that
he
could
never
hope
that
his
poem
should
pass
through
the
world
half
so
uncensured
as
she
had
done
it
would
seem
that
the
modern
critics
who
have
undertaken
to
champion
miss
fermor
against
what
they
are
pleased
to
term
the
revolting
behavior
of
the
poet
are
fighting
a
needless
battle
a
pretty
girl
who
would
long
since
have
been
forgotten
sat
as
an
unconscious
model
to
a
great
poet
he
made
her
the
central
figure
in
a
brilliant
picture
and
rendered
her
name
immortal
that
is
the
whole
story
and
when
carping
critics
begin
to
search
the
poem
for
the
improprieties
of
conduct
to
which
they
say
pope
alluded
one
has
but
to
answer
in
pope
own
words
if
to
her
share
some
female
errors
fall
look
on
her
face
and
you
forget
all
pope
statement
in
the
dedication
that
he
had
been
forced
into
publishing
the
first
draft
of
the
poem
before
his
design
of
enlarging
it
was
half
executed
is
probably
to
be
taken
like
many
of
his
statements
with
a
sufficient
grain
of
salt
pope
had
a
curious
habit
of
protesting
that
he
was
forced
into
publishing
his
letters
poems
and
other
trifles
merely
to
forestall
the
appearance
of
unauthorized
editions
it
is
more
likely
that
it
was
the
undoubted
success
of
rape
of
the
lock
in
its
first
form
which
gave
him
the
idea
of
working
up
the
sketch
into
a
complete
poem
examples
of
such
a
poem
were
familiar
enough
to
pope
not
to
go
back
to
the
mock
epic
which
relates
the
battle
of
the
frogs
and
mice
vida
in
italy
and
boileau
in
france
with
both
of
whom
pope
as
the
on
criticism
shows
was
well
acquainted
had
done
work
of
this
kind
vida
description
of
the
game
of
chess
in
his
ludus
certainly
gave
him
the
model
for
the
game
of
ombre
in
the
third
canto
of
rape
of
the
lock
boileau
probably
suggested
to
him
the
idea
of
using
the
for
the
purposes
of
satire
now
it
was
a
dogma
of
the
critical
creed
of
the
day
which
pope
devoutly
accepted
that
every
epic
must
have
a
machinery
machinery
as
he
kindly
explained
to
miss
fermor
was
a
term
invented
by
the
critics
to
signify
that
part
which
the
deities
angels
or
demons
are
made
to
act
in
a
poem
in
short
for
the
whole
supernatural
element
such
machinery
was
quite
wanting
in
the
first
draft
of
the
rape
it
must
be
supplied
if
the
poem
was
to
be
a
true
epic
even
of
the
comic
kind
and
the
machinery
must
be
of
a
nature
which
would
lend
itself
to
the
light
satiric
tone
of
the
poem
what
was
it
to
be
the
employment
of
what
we
may
call
christian
machinery
the
angels
and
devils
of
tasso
and
milton
was
of
course
out
of
the
question
the
employment
of
the
classic
machinery
was
almost
as
impossible
it
would
have
been
hard
for
such
an
admirer
of
the
classics
as
pope
to
have
taken
the
deities
of
olympus
otherwise
than
seriously
and
even
if
he
had
been
able
to
treat
them
humorously
the
humor
would
have
been
a
form
of
burlesque
quite
at
variance
with
what
he
had
set
out
to
accomplish
for
pope
purpose
springing
naturally
from
the
occasion
which
set
him
to
writing
the
was
not
to
burlesque
what
was
naturally
lofty
by
exhibiting
it
in
a
degraded
light
but
to
show
the
true
littleness
of
the
trivial
by
treating
it
in
a
grandiose
and
fashion
to
make
the
quarrel
over
the
stolen
lock
ridiculous
by
raising
it
to
the
plane
of
the
epic
contest
before
the
walls
of
troy
in
his
perplexity
a
happy
thought
little
less
in
fact
than
an
inspiration
of
genius
came
to
pope
he
had
been
reading
a
book
by
a
clever
french
abbé
treating
in
a
satiric
fashion
of
the
doctrines
of
the
rosicrucians
in
particular
of
their
ideas
of
elemental
spirits
and
the
influence
of
these
spirits
upon
human
affairs
here
was
the
machinery
he
was
looking
for
made
to
his
hand
there
would
be
no
burlesque
in
introducing
the
rosicrucian
sylphs
and
gnomes
into
a
poem
for
few
people
certainly
not
the
author
of
the
de
gabalis
took
them
seriously
yet
the
widespread
popularity
of
this
book
to
say
nothing
of
the
existence
of
certain
rosicrucian
societies
had
rendered
their
names
familiar
to
the
society
for
which
pope
wrote
he
had
but
to
weave
them
into
the
action
of
his
poem
and
the
brilliant
little
sketch
of
society
was
transformed
into
a
true
the
manner
in
which
this
interweaving
was
accomplished
is
one
of
the
most
satisfactory
evidences
of
pope
artistic
genius
he
was
proud
of
it
himself
the
making
the
machinery
and
what
was
published
before
hit
so
well
together
is
he
told
spencer
i
think
one
of
the
greatest
proofs
of
judgment
of
anything
i
ever
did
and
he
might
well
be
proud
macaulay
in
a
passage
has
pointed
out
how
seldom
in
the
history
of
literature
such
a
recasting
of
a
poem
has
been
successfully
accomplished
but
pope
revision
of
rape
of
the
was
so
successful
that
the
original
form
was
practically
done
away
with
no
one
reads
it
now
but
professed
students
of
the
literature
of
queen
anne
time
and
so
artfully
has
the
new
matter
been
woven
into
the
old
that
if
the
recasting
of
rape
of
the
lock
were
not
a
commonplace
even
in
school
histories
of
english
literature
not
one
reader
in
a
hundred
would
suspect
that
the
original
sketch
had
been
revised
and
enlarged
to
more
than
twice
its
length
it
would
be
an
interesting
task
for
the
student
to
compare
the
two
forms
printed
in
this
edition
to
note
exactly
what
has
been
added
and
the
reasons
for
its
addition
and
to
mark
how
pope
has
smoothed
the
junctures
and
blended
the
old
and
the
new
nothing
that
he
could
do
would
admit
him
more
intimately
to
the
secrets
of
pope
mastery
of
his
art
a
word
must
be
said
in
closing
as
to
the
merits
of
rape
of
the
lock
and
its
position
in
english
literature
in
the
first
place
it
is
an
inimitable
picture
of
one
phase
at
least
of
the
life
of
the
time
of
the
gay
witty
heartless
society
of
queen
anne
day
slowly
recovering
from
the
licentious
excesses
of
the
restoration
society
at
this
time
was
perhaps
unmoral
rather
than
immoral
it
was
quite
without
ideals
unless
indeed
the
conventions
of
good
form
may
be
dignified
by
that
name
it
lacked
the
brilliant
enthusiasm
of
elizabethan
times
as
well
as
the
religious
earnestness
of
the
puritans
and
the
devotion
to
patriotic
and
social
ideals
which
marked
a
later
age
nothing
perhaps
is
more
characteristic
of
the
age
than
its
attitude
toward
women
it
affected
indeed
a
tone
of
adoration
which
thinly
veiled
a
cynical
contempt
it
styled
woman
a
goddess
and
really
regarded
her
as
little
better
than
a
doll
the
passion
of
love
had
fallen
from
the
high
estate
it
once
possessed
and
become
the
mere
relaxation
of
the
idle
moments
of
a
man
of
fashion
in
the
comedies
of
congreve
for
example
a
lover
even
if
honestly
in
love
thinks
it
as
incumbent
upon
him
to
make
light
of
his
passion
before
his
friends
as
to
exaggerate
it
in
all
the
forms
of
affected
compliment
before
his
mistress
in
rape
of
the
lock
pope
has
caught
and
fixed
forever
the
atmosphere
of
this
age
it
is
not
the
mere
outward
form
and
circumstance
the
manners
and
customs
the
patching
powdering
ogling
gambling
of
the
day
that
he
has
reproduced
though
his
account
of
these
would
alone
suffice
to
secure
the
poem
immortality
as
a
contribution
to
the
history
of
society
the
essential
spirit
of
the
age
breathes
from
every
line
no
great
english
poem
is
at
once
so
brilliant
and
so
empty
so
artistic
and
yet
so
devoid
of
the
ideals
on
which
all
high
art
rests
it
is
incorrect
i
think
to
consider
pope
in
rape
of
the
lock
as
the
satirist
of
his
age
he
was
indeed
clever
enough
to
perceive
its
follies
and
witty
enough
to
make
sport
of
them
but
it
is
much
to
be
doubted
whether
he
was
wise
enough
at
this
time
to
raise
his
eyes
to
anything
better
in
the
social
satires
of
pope
great
admirer
byron
we
are
at
no
loss
to
perceive
the
ideal
of
personal
liberty
which
the
poet
opposes
to
the
conventions
he
tears
to
shreds
is
it
possible
to
discover
in
rape
of
the
lock
any
substitute
for
fancies
and
the
baron
freaks
the
speech
of
clarissa
which
pope
inserted
as
an
afterthought
to
point
the
moral
of
the
poem
recommends
belinda
to
trust
to
merit
rather
than
to
charms
but
merit
is
explicitly
identified
with
good
humor
a
very
amiable
quality
but
hardly
of
the
highest
rank
among
the
moral
virtues
and
the
avowed
end
and
purpose
of
merit
is
merely
to
preserve
what
beauty
gains
the
flattering
attentions
of
the
other
sex
surely
the
lowest
ideal
ever
set
before
womankind
the
truth
is
i
think
that
rape
of
the
represents
pope
attitude
toward
the
social
life
of
his
time
in
the
period
of
his
brilliant
youth
he
was
at
once
dazzled
amused
and
delighted
by
the
gay
world
in
which
he
found
himself
the
apples
of
pleasure
had
not
yet
turned
to
ashes
on
his
lips
and
it
is
the
sympathy
with
the
world
he
paints
which
gives
to
the
poem
the
air
most
characteristic
of
the
age
itself
of
easy
idle
unthinking
gayety
we
would
not
have
it
otherwise
there
are
sermons
and
satires
in
abundance
in
english
literature
but
there
is
only
one
of
the
lock
the
form
of
the
poem
is
in
perfect
correspondence
with
its
spirit
there
is
an
immense
advance
over
the
on
criticism
in
ease
polish
and
balance
of
matter
and
manner
and
it
is
not
merely
in
matters
of
detail
that
the
supremacy
of
the
latter
poem
is
apparent
rape
of
the
lock
is
remarkable
among
all
pope
longer
poems
as
the
one
complete
and
perfect
whole
it
is
no
mosaic
of
brilliant
epigrams
but
an
organic
creation
it
is
impossible
to
detach
any
one
of
its
witty
paragraphs
and
read
it
with
the
same
pleasure
it
arouses
when
read
in
its
proper
connection
thalestris
call
to
arms
and
clarissa
moral
reproof
are
integral
parts
of
the
poem
and
as
a
result
perhaps
of
its
essential
unity
rape
of
the
lock
bears
witness
to
the
presence
of
a
power
in
pope
that
we
should
hardly
have
suspected
from
his
other
works
the
power
of
dramatic
characterization
elsewhere
he
has
shown
himself
a
master
of
brilliant
portraiture
but
belinda
the
baron
and
thalestris
are
something
more
than
portraits
they
are
living
people
acting
and
speaking
with
admirable
consistency
even
the
little
sketch
of
sir
plume
is
instinct
with
life
finally
rape
of
the
lock
in
its
limitations
and
defects
no
less
than
in
its
excellencies
represents
a
whole
period
of
english
poetry
the
period
which
reaches
with
but
few
exceptions
from
dryden
to
wordsworth
the
creed
which
dominated
poetic
composition
during
this
period
is
discussed
in
the
introduction
to
the
essay
on
criticism
see
and
is
admirably
illustrated
in
that
poem
itself
its
repression
of
individuality
its
insistence
upon
the
necessity
of
following
in
the
footsteps
of
the
classic
poets
and
of
checking
the
outbursts
of
imagination
by
the
rules
of
common
sense
simply
incapacitated
the
poets
of
the
period
from
producing
works
of
the
highest
order
and
its
insistence
upon
man
as
he
appeared
in
the
conventional
urban
society
of
the
day
as
the
one
true
theme
of
poetry
its
belief
that
the
end
of
poetry
was
to
instruct
and
improve
either
by
positive
teaching
or
by
negative
satire
still
further
limited
its
field
one
must
remember
in
attempting
an
estimate
of
rape
of
the
lock
that
it
was
composed
with
an
undoubting
acceptance
of
this
creed
and
within
all
these
narrowing
limitations
and
when
this
is
borne
in
mind
it
is
hardly
too
much
to
say
that
the
poem
attains
the
highest
point
possible
in
its
treatment
of
the
supernatural
it
is
as
original
as
a
poem
could
be
at
that
day
the
brilliancy
of
its
picture
of
contemporary
society
could
not
be
heightened
by
a
single
stroke
its
satire
is
swift
and
keen
but
never
ill
natured
and
the
personality
of
pope
himself
shines
through
every
line

two
centuries
before

probable
that

was
an
elaborate

one

see
ombre
a
game
of
cards
invented
in
spain
it
takes
its
name
from
the
spanish
phrase
originally
used
by
the
player
who
declared
trumps
yo
soy
i
am
the
man
it
could
be
played
by
three
five
or
nine
players
but
the
usual
number
was
three
as
here
each
of
these
received
nine
cards
and
one
of
them
named
the
trump
and
thus
became
the
ombre
who
played
against
the
two
others
if
either
of
the
opponents
took
more
tricks
than
the
ombre
it
was
codille
this
meant
that
the
opponent
took
the
stake
and
the
ombre
had
to
replace
it
for
the
next
hand
a
peculiar
feature
of
ombre
is
the
rank
or
value
of
the
cards
the
three
best
cards
were
called
matadores
a
spanish
word
meaning
killers
the
first
of
these
matadores
was
spadillio
the
ace
of
spades
the
third
was
basto
the
ace
of
clubs
the
second
manillio
varied
according
to
the
suit
if
a
black
suit
were
declared
maniilio
was
the
two
of
trumps
if
a
red
suit
manillio
was
the
seven
of
trumps
it
is
worth
noting
also
that
the
red
aces
were
inferior
to
the
face
cards
of
their
suits
except
when
a
red
suit
was
trump
a
brief
analysis
of
the
game
played
on
this
occasion
will
clear
up
the
passage
and
leave
the
reader
free
to
admire
the
ingenuity
with
which
pope
has
described
the
contest
in
terms
of
epic
poetry
belinda
declares
spades
trumps
and
so
becomes
the
ombre
she
leads
one
after
the
other
the
three
matadores
and
takes
three
tricks
she
then
leads
the
next
highest
card
the
king
of
spades
and
wins
a
fourth
trick
being
out
of
trumps
she
now
leads
the
king
of
clubs
but
the
baron
who
has
actually
held
more
spades
than
belinda
trumps
it
with
the
queen
of
spades
all
the
trumps
are
now
exhausted
and
the
long
suit
of
diamonds
is
established
he
takes
the
sixth
seventh
and
eighth
tricks
with
the
king
queen
and
knave
of
diamonds
respectively
everything
now
depends
on
the
last
trick
since
belinda
and
the
baron
each
have
taken
four
the
baron
leads
the
ace
of
hearts
and
belinda
takes
it
with
the
king
thus
escaping
codille
and
winning
the
stake

sacred
nine

impropriety
of

enough
to
echo
his
objection

an
essay
on
criticism
introduction
the
on
criticism
was
the
first
really
important
work
that
pope
gave
to
the
world
he
had
been
composing
verses
from
early
boyhood
and
had
actually
published
a
set
of
which
had
attracted
some
attention
he
was
already
known
to
the
literary
set
of
london
coffeehouses
as
a
young
man
of
keen
wit
and
high
promise
but
to
the
reading
public
at
large
he
was
as
yet
an
unknown
quantity
with
the
appearance
of
the
pope
not
only
sprang
at
once
into
the
full
light
of
publicity
but
seized
almost
undisputed
that
position
as
the
first
of
living
english
poets
which
he
was
to
retain
unchallenged
till
his
death
even
after
his
death
down
to
the
romantic
revival
in
fact
pope
supremacy
was
an
article
of
critical
faith
and
this
supremacy
was
in
no
small
measure
founded
upon
the
acknowledged
merits
of
the
on
criticism
johnson
the
last
great
representative
of
own
school
of
thought
in
matters
literary
held
that
the
poet
had
never
excelled
this
early
work
and
gave
it
as
his
deliberate
opinion
that
if
pope
had
written
nothing
else
the
would
have
placed
him
among
the
first
poets
and
the
first
critics
the
on
criticism
is
hardly
an
poem
but
it
certainly
made
alexander
pope
the
poem
was
published
anonymously
in
the
spring
of
when
pope
was
years
old
there
has
been
considerable
dispute
as
to
the
date
of
its
composition
but
the
facts
seem
to
be
that
it
was
begun
in
and
finished
in
when
pope
had
it
printed
not
for
publication
but
for
purposes
of
further
correction
as
it
stands
therefore
it
represents
a
work
planned
at
the
close
of
pope
precocious
youth
and
executed
and
polished
in
the
first
flush
of
his
manhood
and
it
is
quite
fair
to
say
that
considering
the
age
of
its
author
the
on
criticism
is
one
of
the
most
remarkable
works
in
english
not
that
there
is
anything
particularly
original
about
the
on
the
contrary
it
is
one
of
the
most
conventional
of
all
pope
works
it
has
nothing
of
the
lively
fancy
of
rape
of
the
lock
little
or
nothing
of
the
personal
note
which
stamps
the
later
satires
and
epistles
as
so
peculiarly
pope
own
apart
from
its
brilliant
epigrammatic
expression
the
on
criticism
might
have
been
written
by
almost
any
man
of
letters
in
queen
anne
day
who
took
the
trouble
to
think
a
little
about
the
laws
of
literature
and
who
thought
about
those
laws
strictly
in
accordance
with
the
accepted
conventions
of
his
time
pope
is
not
in
the
least
to
be
blamed
for
this
lack
of
originality
profound
original
criticism
is
perhaps
the
very
last
thing
to
be
expected
of
a
brilliant
boy
and
pope
was
little
more
when
he
planned
this
work
but
boy
as
he
was
he
had
already
accomplished
an
immense
amount
of
desultory
reading
not
only
in
literature
proper
but
in
literary
criticism
as
well
he
told
spence
in
later
years
that
in
his
youth
he
had
gone
through
all
the
best
critics
naming
especially
quintilian
rapin
and
bossu
a
mere
cursory
reading
of
the
essay
shows
that
he
had
also
studied
horace
vida
and
boileau
before
he
began
to
write
he
had
so
he
told
spence
digested
all
the
matter
of
the
poem
into
prose
in
other
words
then
the
on
criticism
is
at
once
the
result
of
pope
early
studies
the
embodiment
of
the
received
literary
doctrines
of
his
age
and
as
a
consecutive
study
of
his
poems
shows
the
programme
in
accordance
with
which
making
due
allowance
for
certain
exceptions
and
inconsistencies
he
evolved
the
main
body
of
his
work
it
would
however
be
a
mistake
to
treat
as
did
pope
first
editor
the
on
criticism
as
a
methodical
elaborate
and
systematic
treatise
pope
indeed
was
flattered
to
have
a
scholar
of
such
recognized
authority
as
warburton
to
interpret
his
works
and
permitted
him
to
print
a
commentary
upon
the
which
is
quite
as
long
and
infinitely
duller
than
the
original
but
the
true
nature
of
the
poem
is
indicated
by
its
title
it
is
not
an
of
poetry
such
as
boileau
composed
but
an
and
by
the
word
essay
pope
meant
exactly
what
bacon
did
a
tentative
sketch
a
series
of
detached
thoughts
upon
a
subject
not
a
complete
study
or
a
methodical
treatise
all
that
we
know
of
pope
method
of
study
habit
of
thought
and
practice
of
composition
goes
to
support
this
opinion
he
read
widely
but
desultorily
thought
swiftly
and
brilliantly
but
illogically
and
inconsistently
and
composed
in
minute
sections
on
the
backs
of
letters
and
scraps
of
waste
paper
fragments
which
he
afterward
united
rather
than
blended
to
make
a
complete
poem
a
mosaic
rather
than
a
picture
yet
the
is
by
no
means
the
collection
of
independent
maxims
tied
together
by
the
printer
but
having
no
natural
order
which
de
quincey
pronounced
it
to
be
it
falls
naturally
into
three
parts
the
first
deals
with
the
rules
derived
by
classic
critics
from
the
practice
of
great
poets
and
ever
since
of
binding
force
both
in
the
composition
and
in
the
criticism
of
poetry
the
second
analyzes
with
admirable
sagacity
the
causes
of
faulty
criticism
as
pride
imperfect
learning
prejudice
and
so
on
the
third
part
discusses
the
qualities
which
a
true
critic
should
possess
good
taste
learning
modesty
frankness
and
tact
and
concludes
with
a
brief
sketch
of
the
history
of
criticism
from
aristotle
to
walsh
this
is
the
general
outline
of
the
poem
sufficient
i
think
to
show
that
it
is
not
a
mere
bundle
of
poetic
formulae
but
within
these
broad
limits
the
thought
of
the
poem
wanders
freely
and
is
quite
rambling
inconsistent
and
illogical
enough
to
show
that
pope
is
not
formulating
an
exact
and
definitely
determined
system
of
thought
such
indeed
was
i
fancy
hardly
his
purpose
it
was
rather
to
give
clear
vivid
and
convincing
expression
to
certain
ideas
which
were
at
that
time
generally
accepted
as
orthodox
in
the
realm
of
literary
criticism
no
better
expression
of
these
ideas
can
be
found
anywhere
than
in
the
itself
but
a
brief
statement
in
simple
prose
of
some
of
the
most
important
may
serve
as
a
guide
to
the
young
student
of
the
essay
in
the
first
place
the
ultimate
source
alike
of
poetry
and
criticism
is
a
certain
intuitive
faculty
common
to
all
men
though
more
highly
developed
in
some
than
others
called
reason
or
sometimes
good
sense
the
first
rule
for
the
budding
poet
or
critic
is
follow
nature
this
by
the
way
sounds
rather
modern
and
might
be
accepted
by
any
romantic
poet
but
by
nature
was
meant
not
at
all
the
natural
impulses
of
the
individual
but
those
rules
founded
upon
the
natural
and
common
reason
of
mankind
which
the
ancient
critics
had
extracted
and
codified
from
the
practice
of
the
ancient
poets
pope
says
explicitly
to
follow
nature
is
to
follow
them
and
he
praises
virgil
for
turning
aside
from
his
own
original
conceptions
to
imitate
homer
for
nature
and
homer
were
he
found
the
same
certain
exceptions
to
these
rules
were
indeed
allowable
severer
critics
than
pope
by
the
way
absolutely
denied
this
but
only
to
the
ancient
poets
the
moderns
must
not
dare
to
make
use
of
them
or
at
the
very
best
moderns
must
only
venture
upon
such
exceptions
to
the
rules
as
classic
precedents
would
justify
inasmuch
as
all
these
rules
were
discovered
and
illustrated
in
ancient
times
it
followed
logically
that
the
great
breach
with
antiquity
which
is
called
the
middle
ages
was
a
period
of
hopeless
and
unredeemed
barbarism
incapable
of
bringing
forth
any
good
thing
the
light
of
literature
began
to
dawn
again
with
the
revival
of
learning
at
the
renaissance
but
the
great
poets
of
the
renaissance
spenser
and
shakespeare
for
example
were
irregular
that
is
they
trusted
too
much
to
their
individual
powers
and
did
not
accept
with
sufficient
humility
the
orthodox
rules
of
poetry
this
dogma
by
the
way
is
hardly
touched
upon
in
the
but
is
elaborated
with
great
emphasis
in
pope
later
utterance
on
the
principles
of
literature
the
to
augustus
finally
with
the
establishment
of
the
reign
of
reason
in
france
under
louis
xiv
and
in
england
a
little
later
the
full
day
had
come
and
literary
sins
of
omission
and
commission
that
might
be
winked
at
in
such
an
untutored
genius
as
shakespeare
were
now
unpardonable
this
last
dogma
explains
the
fact
that
in
the
brief
sketch
of
the
history
of
criticism
which
concludes
the
pope
does
not
condescend
to
name
an
english
poet
or
critic
prior
to
the
reign
of
charles
ii
it
would
be
beside
the
purpose
to
discuss
these
ideas
or
to
attempt
an
elaborate
refutation
of
their
claims
to
acceptance
time
has
done
its
work
upon
them
and
the
literary
creed
of
the
wits
of
queen
anne
day
is
as
antiquated
as
their
periwigs
and
except
for
purposes
of
historical
investigation
it
is
quite
absurd
to
take
the
on
criticism
seriously
and
yet
it
has
even
for
us
of
a
real
value
our
age
absolutely
lacks
a
standard
of
literary
criticism
and
of
all
standards
the
one
least
likely
to
be
accepted
is
that
of
pope
and
his
individual
taste
reigns
supreme
in
this
democratic
age
and
one
judgment
is
as
good
as
perhaps
a
little
better
than
another
but
even
this
democratic
and
individual
age
may
profit
by
turning
back
for
a
time
to
consider
some
of
the
general
truths
as
valid
as
ever
to
which
pope
gave
such
inimitable
expression
or
to
study
the
outlines
of
that
noble
picture
of
the
true
critic
which
beuve
declared
every
professed
critic
should
frame
and
hang
up
in
his
study
an
age
which
seems
at
times
upon
the
point
of
throwing
classical
studies
overboard
as
useless
lumber
might
do
far
worse
than
listen
to
the
eloquent
tribute
which
the
poet
pays
to
the
great
writers
of
antiquity
and
finally
nothing
could
be
more
salutary
for
an
age
in
which
literature
itself
has
caught
something
of
the
taint
of
the
prevailing
commercialism
than
to
bathe
itself
again
in
that
spirit
of
sincere
and
disinterested
love
of
letters
which
breathes
throughout
the
and
which
in
spite
of
all
his
errors
and
jealousies
and
petty
vices
was
the
of
alexander
pope
censure
the
word
has
here
its
original
meaning
of
judge
not
its
modern
judge
severely
or
blame
because
each
foolish
poem
provokes
a
host
of
foolish
commentators
and
critics
this
assertion
that
only
a
good
writer
can
be
a
fair
critic
is
not
to
be
accepted
without
reservation
the
word
wit
has
a
number
of
different
meanings
in
this
poem
and
the
student
should
be
careful
to
discriminate
between
them
it
means
mind
intellect
learning
culture
l
imagination
genius
the
power
to
discover
amusing
analogies
or
the
apt
expression
of
such
an
analogy

a
man
possessed
of
wit
in
its
various
significations
this
last
form
usually
occurs
in
the
plural

the
maze
of
schools
the
labyrinth
of
conflicting
systems
of
thought
especially
of
criticism
coxcombs
fools
what
is
the
difference
in
meaning
between
these
words
in
this
passage
in
this
couplet
pope
hits
off
the
spiteful
envy
of
conceited
critics
toward
successful
writers
if
the
critic
can
write
himself
he
hates
the
author
as
a
rival
if
he
can
not
he
entertains
against
him
the
deep
grudge
an
incapable
man
so
often
cherishes
toward
an
effective
worker
mævius
a
poetaster
whose
name
has
been
handed
down
by
virgil
and
horace
his
name
like
that
of
his
associate
bavius
has
become
a
for
a
wretched
scribbler
here
thought
of
as
the
god
of
poetry
the
true
poet
was
inspired
by
apollo
but
a
poetaster
like
mævius
wrote
without
inspiration
as
it
were
in
spite
of
the
god
pope
here
compares
critics
to
the
animals
which
old
writers
reported
were
bred
from
the
nile
mud
in
and
cleopatra
for
example
lepidus
says
your
serpent
of
egypt
is
bred
now
of
your
mud
by
the
operation
of
your
sun
so
is
your
crocodile
pope
thinks
of
these
animals
as
in
the
unformed
stage
part
kindled
into
life
part
a
lump
of
mud
so
these
critics
are
unfinished
things
for
which
no
proper
name
can
be
found
equivocal
generation
is
the
old
term
used
to
denote
spontaneous
generation
of
this
sort
pope
applies
it
here
to
critics
without
proper
training
who
spring
spontaneously
from
the
mire
of
ignorance

the
idea
is
that
a

this
is
the
old
threefold
division
of
the
human
mind
pope
means
that
where
one
of
these
faculties
is
above
the
average
in
any
individual
another
of
them
is
sure
to
fall

so
according
to

first
arrangement

he
later
shifted
it
to
its

position

that
is
to

out

english
judges
decided
in

test
case
that
it
is
a
privilege
inseparably
connected
with
the
sovereignty
of
the
king
to
dispense
with
penal
laws
and
that
according
to
his
own
judgment
the
english
people
very
naturally
felt
that
such
a
privilege
opened
the
door
to
absolute
monarchy
and
after
the
fall
of
james

parliament
declared
in

the
pretended

of
suspending

consent
of

neatly
suggests
that
it

that

in
with

who
had
written

about

original
story
was
established
by

combat
in

lists

the
poet
proposed
to
omit
as
contrary
to
the
rules
of
aristotle
the
don
although
professing
great
respect
for
aristotle
insisted
that
the
combat

which

there
is
no
reason

proves
that

design

an
essay
on

introduction
the
on
man
is
the
longest
and
in
some
ways
the
most
important
work
of
the
third
period
of
pope
career
it
corresponds
closely
to
his
early
work
the
on
criticism
like
the
earlier
work
the
on
man
is
a
didactic
poem
written
primarily
to
diffuse
and
popularize
certain
ideas
of
the
poet
as
in
the
earlier
work
these
ideas
are
by
no
means
original
with
pope
but
were
the
common
property
of
a
school
of
thinkers
in
his
day
as
in
the
on
criticism
pope
here
attempts
to
show
that
these
ideas
have
their
origin
in
nature
and
are
consistent
with
the
common
sense
of
man
and
finally
the
merit
of
the
later
work
even
more
than
of
the
earlier
is
due
to
the
force
and
brilliancy
of
detached
passages
rather
than
to
any
coherent
consistent
and
system
which
it
presents
the
close
of
the
seventeenth
century
and
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
was
marked
by
a
change
of
ground
in
the
sphere
of
religious
controversy
the
old
debates
between
the
catholic
and
protestant
churches
gradually
died
out
as
these
two
branches
of
western
christianity
settled
down
in
quiet
possession
of
the
territory
they
still
occupy
in
their
place
arose
a
vigorous
controversy
on
the
first
principles
of
religion
in
general
on
the
nature
of
god
the
origin
of
evil
the
place
of
man
in
the
universe
and
the
respective
merits
of
optimism
and
pessimism
as
philosophic
theories
the
controversialists
as
a
rule
either
rejected
or
neglected
the
dogmas
of
revealed
religion
and
based
their
arguments
upon
real
or
supposed
facts
of
history
physical
nature
and
the
mental
processes
and
moral
characteristics
of
man
in
this
controversy
the
two
parties
at
times
were
curiously
mingled
orthodox
clergymen
used
arguments
which
justified
a
strong
suspicion
of
their
orthodoxy
and
avowed
freethinkers
bitterly
disclaimed
the
imputation
of
atheism
and
wrote
in
terms
that
might
be
easily
adopted
by
a
devout
believer
into
this
controversy
pope
was
led
by
his
deepening
intimacy
with
bolingbroke
who
had
returned
from
france
in
and
settled
at
his
country
place
within
a
few
miles
of
twickenham
during
his
long
exile
bolingbroke
had
amused
himself
with
the
study
of
moral
philosophy
and
natural
religion
and
in
his
frequent
intercourse
with
pope
he
poured
out
his
opinions
with
all
the
fluency
vigor
and
polish
which
made
him
so
famous
among
the
orators
and
talkers
of
the
day
bolingbroke
views
were
for
that
time
distinctly
heterodox
and
if
logically
developed
led
to
complete
agnosticism
but
he
seems
to
have
avoided
a
complete
statement
of
his
ideas
to
pope
possibly
for
fear
of
shocking
or
frightening
the
sensitive
little
poet
who
still
remained
a
professed
catholic
pope
however
was
very
far
from
being
a
strict
catholic
and
indeed
prided
himself
on
the
breadth
and
liberality
of
his
opinions
he
was
therefore
at
once
fascinated
and
stimulated
by
the
eloquent
conversation
of
bolingbroke
and
resolved
to
write
a
philosophical
poem
in
which
to
embody
the
ideas
they
held
in
common
bolingbroke
approved
of
the
idea
and
went
so
far
as
to
furnish
the
poet
with
seven
or
eight
sheets
of
notes
to
direct
the
plan
in
general
and
to
supply
matter
for
particular
epistles
lord
bathurst
who
knew
both
pope
and
bolingbroke
went
so
far
as
to
say
in
later
years
that
the
was
originally
composed
by
bolingbroke
in
prose
and
that
pope
only
put
it
into
verse
but
this
is
undoubtedly
an
exaggeration
of
what
pope
himself
frankly
acknowledged
that
the
poem
was
composed
under
the
influence
of
bolingbroke
that
in
the
main
it
reflected
his
opinions
and
that
bolingbroke
had
assisted
him
in
the
general
plan
and
in
numerous
details
very
properly
therefore
the
poem
is
addressed
to
bolingbroke
and
begins
and
closes
with
a
direct
address
to
the
guide
philosopher
and
friend
in
substance
the
on
man
is
a
discussion
of
the
moral
order
of
the
world
its
purpose
is
to
vindicate
the
ways
of
god
to
man
and
it
may
therefore
be
regarded
as
an
attempt
to
confute
the
skeptics
who
argued
from
the
existence
of
evil
in
the
world
and
the
wretchedness
of
man
existence
to
the
impossibility
of
belief
in
an
and
god
it
attempts
to
do
this
not
by
an
appeal
to
revelation
or
the
doctrines
of
christianity
but
simply
on
the
basis
of
a
interpretation
of
the
facts
of
existence
a
brief
outline
of
the
poem
will
show
the
general
tenor
of
argument
the
first
epistle
deals
with
the
nature
and
state
of
man
with
respect
to
the
universe
it
insists
on
the
limitations
of
man
knowledge
and
the
consequent
absurdity
of
his
presuming
to
murmur
against
god
it
teaches
that
the
universe
was
not
made
for
man
but
that
man
with
all
his
apparent
imperfections
is
exactly
fitted
to
the
place
which
he
occupies
in
the
universe
in
the
physical
universe
all
things
work
together
for
good
although
certain
aspects
of
nature
seem
evil
to
man
and
likewise
in
the
moral
universe
all
things
even
man
passions
and
crimes
conduce
to
the
general
good
of
the
whole
finally
it
urges
calm
submission
and
acquiescence
in
what
is
hard
to
understand
since
one
truth
is
clear
whatever
is
is
right
the
second
epistle
deals
with
the
nature
of
man
as
an
individual
it
begins
by
urging
men
to
abandon
vain
questionings
of
god
providence
and
to
take
up
the
consideration
of
their
own
natures
for
the
proper
study
of
mankind
is
man
pope
points
out
that
the
two
cardinal
principles
of
man
nature
are
and
reason
the
first
an
impelling
the
second
a
regulating
power
the
aim
of
both
these
principles
is
pleasure
by
which
pope
means
happiness
which
he
takes
for
the
highest
good
each
man
is
dominated
by
a
master
passion
and
it
is
the
proper
function
of
reason
to
control
this
passion
for
good
and
to
make
it
bear
fruit
in
virtue
no
man
is
wholly
virtuous
or
vicious
and
heaven
uses
the
mingled
qualities
of
men
to
bind
them
together
in
mutual
interdependence
and
makes
the
various
passions
and
imperfections
of
mankind
serve
the
general
good
and
the
final
conclusion
is
that
though
man
a
fool
yet
god
is
wise
the
third
epistle
treats
of
the
nature
of
man
with
respect
to
society
all
creatures
pope
asserts
are
bound
together
and
live
not
for
themselves
alone
but
man
is
preeminently
a
social
being
the
first
state
of
man
was
the
state
of
nature
when
he
lived
in
innocent

the
last

the
nature
of
happiness
our

end
and

happiness
is
attainable
by
all
men
who
think
right
and
mean
well
it
consists
not
in
individual
but
in
mutual
pleasure
it
does
not
consist

mere
gifts
of

but
in
health
peace
and
competence
virtuous
men
are
indeed
subject

god
can
not
be
expected
to
suspend
the
operation
of
general
laws
to
spare
the
virtuous
objectors
who
would
construct
a
system

brief
outline

show

some
of
the
inconsistencies

omissions
of

careful
examination

his
arguments

would
be
wholly
out

who
wishes
to
pursue
the

further
may
consult

and
elwin
equally
prosy
refutation
or
better
still
the
admirable
summary
by
leslie
stephen
in
the
chapter
on
this
poem
in
his
life
of
pope
men
of
letters
no
one
is
now
likely
to
turn
to
the
writer
of
the
early
eighteenth
century
for
a
system
of
the
universe
least
of
all
to
a
writer
so
incapable
of
exact
or
systematic
thinking
as
alexander
pope
if
the
on
man
has
any
claim
to
be
read
it
must
be
as
a
piece
of
literature
pure
and
simple
for
philosophy
and
poetry
combined
browning
and
tennyson
lie
nearer
to
our
age
and
mode
of
thought
than
pope
even
regarded
as
a
piece
of
literature
the
on
man
can
not
i
think
claim
the
highest
place
among
pope
works
it
obtained
indeed
a
success
at
home
and
abroad
such
as
was
achieved
by
no
other
english
poem
until
the
appearance
of
harold
it
was
translated
into
french
german
italian
portuguese
polish
and
latin
it
was
imitated
by
wieland
praised
by
voltaire
and
quoted
by
kant
but
this
success
was
due
in
part
to
the
accuracy
with
which
it
reflected
ideas
which
were
the
common
property
of
its
age
in
part
to
the
extraordinary
vigor
and
finish
of
its
epigrams
which
made
it
one
of
the
most
quotable
of
english
poems
but
as
a
whole
the
essay
is
not
a
great
poem
the
poet
is
evidently
struggling
with
a
subject
that
is
too
weighty
for
him
and
at
times
he
staggers
and
sinks
beneath
his
burden
the
second
and
third
books
in
particular
are
it
must
be
confessed
with
the
exception
of
one
or
two
fine
outbursts
little
better
than
dull
and
dullness
is
not
a
quality
one
is
accustomed
to
associate
with
pope
the
on
lacks
the
bright
humor
and
imaginative
artistry
of
rape
of
the
lock
and
the
lively
portraiture
vigorous
satire
and
strong
personal
note
of
the
epistles
and
of
horace
pope
is
at
his
best
when
he
is
dealing
with
a
concrete
world
of
men
and
women
as
they
lived
and
moved
in
the
london
of
his
day
he
is
at
his
worst
when
he
is
attempting
to
seize
and
render
abstract
ideas
yet
the
on
man
is
a
very
remarkable
work
in
the
first
place
it
shows
pope
wonderful
power
of
expression
no
one
can
read
the
poem
for
the
first
time
without
meeting
on
page
after
page
phrases
and
epigrams
which
have
become
part
of
the
common
currency
of
our
language
precision
and
firmness
of
touch
to
quote
the
apt
statement
of
leslie
stephen
enables
him
to
get
the
greatest
possible
meaning
into
a
narrow
compass
he
uses
only
one
epithet
but
it
is
the
right
one
even
when
the
thought
is
commonplace
enough
the
felicity
of
the
expression
gives
it
a
new
and
effective
force
and
there
are
whole
passages
where
pope
rises
high
above
the
mere
coining
of
epigrams
as
i
have
tried
to
show
in
my
notes
he
composed
by
separate
paragraphs
and
when
he
chances
upon
a
topic
that
appeals
to
his
imagination
or
touches
his
heart
we
get
an
outburst
of
poetry
that
shines
in
splendid
contrast
to
the
prosaic
plainness
of
its
surroundings
such
for
example
are
the
noble
verses
that
tell
of
the
immanence
of
god
in
his
creation
at
the
close
of
the
first
epistle
or
the
magnificent
invective
against
tyranny
and
superstition
in
the
third
ll
finally
the
on
man
is
of
interest
in
what
it
tells
us
of
pope
himself
elwin
idea
that
in
the
on
man
pope
partly
the
dupe
partly
the
accomplice
of
bolingbroke
was
attempting
craftily
to
undermine
the
foundations
of
religion
is
a
notion
curiously
compounded
of
critical
blindness
and
theological
rancor
in
spite
of
all
its
incoherencies
and
futilities
the
is
an
honest
attempt
to
express
pope
opinions
borrowed
in
part
of
course
from
his
admired
friend
but
in
part
the
current
notions
of
his
age
on
some
of
the
greatest
questions
that
have
perplexed
the
mind
of
man
and
pope
attitude
toward
the
questions
is
that
of
the
best
minds
of
his
day
at
once
religious
independent
and
sincere
he
acknowledges
the
omnipotence
and
benevolence
of
god
confesses
the
limitations
and
imperfections
of
human
knowledge
teaches
humility
in
the
presence
of
unanswerable
problems
urges
submission
to
divine
providence
extols
virtue
as
the
true
source
of
happiness
and
love
of
man
as
an
essential
of
virtue
if
we
study
the
on
man
as
the
reasoned
argument
of
a
philosopher
we
shall
turn
from
it
with
something
like
contempt
if
we
read
it
as
the
expression
of
a
poet
sentiments
we
shall
i
think
leave
it
with
an
admiration
warmer
than
before
for
a
character
that
has
been
so
much
abused
and
so
little
understood
as
that
of
pope

an

lays
down
as
the

of
his
system

about

must
be

pope
preserves
here
the
latin
pronunciation
four
syllables
with
the
accent
on
the
antepenult
pope
here
takes
it
for
granted
that
our
universe
inasmuch
as
it
is
the
work
of
god
infinite
wisdom
must
be
the
best
system
possible
if
this
be
granted
he
says
it
is
plain
that
man
must
have
a
place
somewhere
in
this
system
and
the
only
question
is
whether
god
has
placed
him
wrong
every
grade
in
creation
must
be
complete
so
as
to
join
with
that
which
is
beneath
and
with
that
which
is
above
it
or
there
would
be
a
lack
of
coherency
a
break

pope
argues
here
that
since
man
is
a
part
of
the
best
possible
system
whatever
seems
wrong
in
him
must
be
right
when
considered
in
relation
to
the
whole
order
of
the
universe
it
is
only
our
ignorance
of
this
order
which
keeps
us
from
realizing
this
fact
one
single
the
word
movement
is
understood
after
single
pope
here
illustrates
his
preceding
argument
by
analogy
we
can
know
no
more
of
god
purpose
in
the
ordering
of
our
lives
than
the
animals
can
know
of
our
ordering
of

ægypt
god
one
of
the
gods
of
the
egyptians
was
the
sacred
bull
apis
a
deity
worshiped
as
a
god
like
the
egyptian
kings
and
roman
emperors
pope
now
goes
on
to
argue
that
on
the
basis
of
what
has
been
proved
we
ought
not
to
regard
man
as
an
imperfect
being
but
rather
as
one
who
is
perfectly
adapted
to
his
place
in
the
universe
his
knowledge
for
example
is
measured
by
the
brief
time
he
has
to
live
and
the
brief
space
he
can
survey
fault
pronounced
in
pope
day
as
rhyming
with
ought
these
lines
are
really
out
of
place
they
first
appeared
after
then
pope
struck
them
out
altogether
just
before
his
death
he
put
them
into
their
present
place
on
the
advice
of
warburton
who
probably
approved
of
them
because
of
their
reference
to
a
future
state
of
bliss
it
is
plain
that
they
interfere
with
the
regular
argument
of
the
poem
this
line
is
grammatically
dependent
upon
hides
riot
used
here
in
the
sense
of
luxurious
life
the
lamb
is
slain
to
provide
for
some
feast
god
hence
the
relative
who
in
the
next
line
pope
urges
man
to
comfort
himself
with
hope
seeing
that
he
can
not
know
the
future
what
future
bliss
the
words
shall
be
are
to
be
understood
after
this
phrase
point
out
the
exact
meaning
of
this
familiar
line
from
home
away
from
its
true
home
the
life
to
come
this
line
represents
one
of
the
alterations
which
warburton
induced
pope
to
make
the
poet
first
wrote
confined
at
home
thus
representing
this
life
as
the
home
of
the
soul

friend
led
him
to
make
the
change
in

to
express
more
clearly

belief
in
the

how
rests
and
expatiates
in
this
line

with
uneasy
and
confined
in
in
this
famous
passage
pope
shows
how
the
belief
in
immortality
is
found
even
among
the
most
ignorant
tribes
this
is
to
pope
an
argument
that
the
soul
must
be
immortal
since
only
nature
or
god
working
through
nature
could
have
implanted
this
conception
in
the
indian

on
to

question
that

human
reasoning
springs
from

that

to
hear
it
pope
following
a
passage
in
scipionis
suggests
that
this
music
is
too
loud
for
human
senses
pope
now
goes
on
to
show
how
in
the
animal
world
there
is
an
exact
gradation
of
the
faculties
of
sense
and
of
the
powers
of
instinct
man
alone
is
endowed
with
reason
which
is
more
than
equivalent
to
all
these
powers
and
makes
him
lord
over
all
animals
the
mole
is
almost
blind
the
lynx
was
supposed
to
be
the
most
of
animals
the
lion
was
supposed
by
pope
to
hunt
by
sight
alone
as
the
dog
by
scent
what
does
he
mean
by
the
tainted
green
fishes
are
almost
deaf
while
birds
are
very
quick
of
hearing
nice
keenly
discriminating
dew
healthful
honey
the
power
of
instinct
which
is
barely
perceptible
in
the
pig
amounts
almost
to
the
power
of
reason
in
the
elephant
barrier
pronounced
like
the
french
as
a
word
of
two
syllables
with
the
accent
on
the
last
sense
thought
sensation
and
reason
middle
natures
intermediate
natures
which
long
to
unite
with
those
above
or
below
them
the
exact
sense
is
not
very
clear
in
this
passage
pope
insists
that
the
chain
of
being
stretches
unbroken
from
god
through
man
to
the
lowest
created
forms
if
any
link
in
this
chain
were
broken
as
would
happen
if
men
possessed
higher
faculties
than
are
now
assigned
them
the
whole
universe
would
be
thrown
into
confusion
this
is
another
answer
to
those
who
complain
of
the
imperfections
of
man
nature
quick
living
pope
does
not
discriminate
between
organic
and
inorganic
matter
glass
microscope
inferior
beings
might
then
press
upon
us
if
they
did
not
a
fatal
gap
would
be
left
by
our
ascent
in
the
scale
each
system
pope
imagines
the
universe
to
be
composed
of
an
infinite
number
of
systems
like
ours
since
each
of
these
is
essential
to
the
orderly
arrangement
of
the
universe
any
disorder
such
as
he
has
imagined
would
have
infinitely
destructive
consequences
these
are
described
in
ll
in
these
lines
pope
speaks
of
god
as
the
soul
of
the
world
in
an
outburst
of
really
exalted
enthusiasm
that
is
rare
enough
in
his
work
that
a
relative
pronoun
referring
to
soul
th
ethereal
frame
the
heavens
as
perfect
in
a
hair
as
heart
this
has
been
called
a
vile
antithesis
on
the
ground
that
there
is
no
reason
why
hair
and
heart
should
be
contrasted
but
pope
may
have
had
in
mind
the
saying
of
christ
the
very
hairs
of
your
head
are
all
numbered
the
hairs
are
spoken
of
here
as
the
least
important
part
of
the
body
the
heart
on
the
other
hand
has
always
been
thought
of
as
the
most
important
organ
there
is
therefore
a
real
antithesis
between
the
two
seraph
burns
the
seraphim
according
to
old
commentators
are
on
fire
with
the
love
of
god
equals
all
makes
all
things
equal
this
does
not
seem
consistent
with
the
idea
of
the
gradations
of
existence
which
pope
has
been
preaching
throughout
this
epistle
possibly
it
means
that
all
things
high
and
low
are
filled
alike
with
the
divine
spirit
and
in
this
sense
all
things
are
equal
but
one
must
not
expect
to
find
exact
and
consistent
philosophy
in
the
on
man
here
pope
sums
up
the
argument
of
this
epistle
urging
man
to
recognize
his
ignorance
to
be
content
with
his
seeming
imperfections
and
to
realize
that
whatever
is
is
right
our
proper
bliss
our
happiness
as
men
point
appointed
place
in
the
universe
secure

hobbes
an
english
philosopher

whose
work
pope
was
no
doubt
acquainted

an
epistle
to
dr
arbuthnot
introduction
next
to
rape
of
the
lock
i
think
the
to
arbuthnot
is
the
most
interesting
and
the
most
important
of
pope
poems
the
most
important
since
it
shows
the
master
poet
of
the
age
employing
his
ripened
powers
in
the
field
most
suitable
for
their
display
that
of
personal
satire
the
most
interesting
because
unlike
his
former
satiric
poem
the
it
is
not
mere
invective
but
gives
us
as
no
other
poem
of
pope
can
be
said
to
do
a
portrait
of
the
poet
himself
like
most
of
pope
poems
the
to
arbuthnot
owes
its
existence
to
an
objective
cause
this
was
the
poet
wish
to
justify
himself
against
a
series
of
savage
attacks
which
had
recently
been
directed
against
him
if
pope
had
expected
by
the
publication
of
the
to
crush
the
herd
of
scribblers
who
had
been
for
years
abusing
him
he
must
have
been
woefully
disappointed
on
the
contrary
the
roar
of
insult
and
calumny
rose
louder
than
ever
and
new
voices
were
added
to
the
chorus
in
the
year
two
enemies
entered
the
field
against
pope
such
as
he
had
never
yet
had
to
encounter
enemies
of
high
social
position
of
acknowledged
wit
and
of
a
certain
though
as
the
sequel
proved
quite
inadequate
talent
for
satire
these
were
lady
mary
wortley
montague
and
lord
john
hervey
lady
mary
had
been
for
years
acknowledged
as
one
of
the
wittiest
most
learned
and
most
beautiful
women
of
her
day
pope
seems
to
have
met
her
in
and
at
once
joined
the
train
of
her
admirers
when
she
accompanied
her
husband
on
his
embassy
to
constantinople
in
the
following
year
the
poet
entered
into
a
long
correspondence
with
her
protesting
in
the
most
elaborate
fashion
his
undying
devotion
on
her
return
he
induced
her
to
settle
with
her
husband
at
twickenham
here
he
continued
his
attentions
half
real
half
in
the
affected
gallantry
of
the
day
until
to
quote
the
lady
own
words
to
her
daughter
many
years
after
at
some
time
when
she
least
expected
what
romancers
call
a
declaration
he
made
such
passionate
love
to
her
as
in
spite
of
her
utmost
endeavours
to
be
angry
and
look
grave
provoked
an
immoderate
fit
of
laughter
and
she
added
from
that
moment
pope
became
her
implacable
enemy
certainly
by
the
time
pope
began
to
write
the
he
was
so
far
estranged
from
his
old
friend
that
he
permitted
himself
in
that
poem
a
scoffing
allusion
to
a
scandal
in
which
she
had
recently
become
involved
the
lady
answered
or
the
poet
thought
that
she
did
with
an
anonymous
pamphlet
pop
upon
pope
describing
a
castigation
wholly
imaginary
said
to
have
been
inflicted
upon
the
poet
as
a
proper
reward
for
his
satire
after
this
of
course
all
hope
of
a
reconciliation
was
at
an
end
and
in
his
satires
and
epistles
pope
repeatedly
introduced
lady
mary
under
various
titles
in
the
most
offensive
fashion
in
his
first
of
horace
published
in
february
he
referred
in
the
most
unpardonable
manner
to
a
certain
sappho
and
the
dangers
attendant
upon
any
acquaintance
with
her
lady
mary
was
foolish
enough
to
apply
the
lines
to
herself
and
to
send
a
common
friend
to
remonstrate
with
pope
he
coolly
replied
that
he
was
surprised
that
lady
mary
should
feel
hurt
since
the
lines
could
only
apply
to
certain
women
naming
four
notorious
scribblers
whose
lives
were
as
immoral
as
their
works
such
an
answer
was
by
no
means
calculated
to
turn
away
the
lady
wrath
and
for
an
ally
in
the
campaign
of
anonymous
abuse
that
she
now
planned
she
sought
out
her
friend
lord
hervey
john
hervey
called
by
courtesy
lord
hervey
the
second
son
of
the
earl
of
bristol
was
one
of
the
most
prominent
figures
at
the
court
of
george
ii
he
had
been
made
of
the
royal
household
in
and
was
the
intimate
friend
and
confidential
adviser
of
queen
caroline
clever
affable
unprincipled
and
cynical
he
was
a
perfect
type
of
the
georgian
courtier
to
whom
loyalty
patriotism
honesty
and
honor
were
so
many
synonyms
for
folly
he
was
effeminate
in
habits
and
appearance
but
notoriously
licentious
he
affected
to
scoff
at
learning
but
made
some
pretense
to
literature
and
had
written
epistles
after
the
manner
of
ovid
and
numerous
political
pamphlets
pope
who
had
some
slight
personal
acquaintance
with
him
disliked
his
political
connections
and
probably
despised
his
verses
and
in
the
already
mentioned
had
alluded
to
him
under
the
title
of
lord
fanny
as
capable
of
turning
out
a
thousand
lines
of
verse
a
day
this
was
sufficient
cause
if
cause
were
needed
to
induce
hervey
to
join
lady
mary
in
her
warfare
against
pope
the
first
blow
was
struck
in
an
anonymous
poem
probably
the
combined
work
of
the
two
allies
called
addressed
to
the
imitator
of
horace
which
appeared
in
march
and
it
was
followed
up
in
august
by
an
from
a
nobleman
to
a
doctor
of
divinity
which
also
appeared
anonymously
but
was
well
known
to
be
the
work
of
lord
hervey
in
these
poems
pope
was
abused
in
the
most
unmeasured
terms
his
work
was
styled
a
mere
collection
of
libels
he
had
no
invention
except
in
defamation
he
was
a
mere
pretender
to
genius
his
morals
were
not
left
unimpeached
he
was
charged
with
selling
other
men
work
printed
in
his
name
a
gross
distortion
of
his
employing
assistants
in
the
translation
of
the
he
was
ungrateful
unjust
a
foe
to
human
kind
an
enemy
like
the
devil
to
all
that
have
being
the
noble
authors
probably
well
aware
how
they
could
give
the
most
pain
proceeded
to
attack
his
family
and
his
distorted
person
his
parents
were
obscure
and
vulgar
people
and
he
himself
a
wretched
outcast
with
the
emblem
of
his
crooked
mind
marked
on
his
back
like
cain
by
god
own
hand
and
to
cap
the
climax
as
soon
as
these
shameful
libels
were
in
print
lord
hervey
bustled
off
to
show
them
to
the
queen
and
to
laugh
with
her
over
the
fine
way
in
which
he
had
put
down
the
bitter
little
poet
in
order
to
understand
and
appreciate
pope
reception
of
these
attacks
we
must
recall
to
ourselves
the
position
in
which
he
lived
he
was
a
catholic
and
i
have
already
introduction
x
called
attention
to
the
precarious
tenure
by
which
the
catholics
of
his
time
held
their
goods
their
persons
their
very
lives
in
security
he
was
the
intimate
of
bolingbroke
of
all
men
living
the
most
detested
by
the
court
and
his
noble
friends
were
almost
without
exception
the
avowed
enemies
of
the
court
party
pope
had
good
reason
to
fear
that
the
malice
of
his
enemies
might
not
be
content
to
stop
with
abusive
doggerel
but
he
was
not
in
the
least
intimidated
on
the
contrary
he
broke
out
in
a
fine
flame
of
wrath
against
lord
hervey
whom
he
evidently
considered
the
chief
offender
challenged
his
enemy
to
disavow
the
and
on
his
declining
to
do
so
proceeded
to
make
what
he
called
a
proper
reply
in
a
prose
to
a
noble
lord
this
masterly
piece
of
satire
was
passed
about
from
hand
to
hand
but
never
printed
we
are
told
that
sir
robert
walpole
who
found
hervey
a
convenient
tool
in
court
intrigues
bribed
pope
not
to
print
it
by
securing
a
good
position
in
france
for
one
of
the
priests
who
had
watched
over
the
poet
youth
if
this
story
be
true
and
we
have
horace
walpole
authority
for
it
we
may
well
imagine
that
the
entry
of
the
bribe
like
that
of
uncle
oath
was
blotted
out
by
a
tear
from
the
books
of
the
recording
angel
but
pope
was
by
no
means
disposed
to
let
the
attacks
go
without
an
answer
of
some
kind
and
the
particular
form
which
his
answer
took
seems
to
have
been
suggested
by
a
letter
from
arbuthnot
i
make
it
my
last
request
wrote
his
beloved
physician
now
sinking
fast
under
the
diseases
that
brought
him
to
the
grave
that
you
continue
that
noble
disdain
and
abhorrence
of
vice
which
you
seem
so
naturally
endued
with
but
still
with
a
due
regard
to
your
own
safety
and
study
more
to
reform
than
to
chastise
though
the
one
often
can
not
be
effected
without
the
other
i
took
very
kindly
your
advice
pope
replied
and
it
has
worked
so
much
upon
me
considering
the
time
and
state
you
gave
it
in
that
i
determined
to
address
to
you
one
of
my
epistles
written
by
piecemeal
many
years
and
which
i
have
now
made
haste
to
put
together
wherein
the
question
is
stated
what
were
and
are
my
motives
of
writing
the
objections
to
them
and
my
answers
in
other
words
the
to
arbuthnot
which
we
see
that
pope
was
working
over
at
the
date
of
this
letter
august
was
in
the
phrase
his
his
defense
of
his
life
and
work
as
usual
pope
account
of
his
work
can
not
be
taken
literally
a
comparison
of
dates
shows
that
the
instead
of
having
been
written
by
piecemeal
many
years
is
essentially
the
work
of
one
impulse
the
desire
to
vindicate
his
character
his
parents
and
his
work
from
the
aspersions
cast
upon
them
by
lord
hervey
and
lady
mary
the
exceptions
to
this
statement
are
two
or
possibly
three
passages
which
we
know
to
have
been
written
earlier
and
worked
into
the
poem
with
infinite
art
the
first
of
these
is
the
famous
portrait
of
addison
as
atticus
i
have
already
spoken
of
the
reasons
that
led
to
pope
breach
with
addison
introduction
xv
and
there
is
good
reason
to
believe
that
this
portrait
sprang
directly
from
pope
bitter
feeling
toward
the
elder
writer
for
his
preference
of
tickell
translation
the
lines
were
certainly
written
in
addison
lifetime
though
we
may
be
permitted
to
doubt
whether
pope
really
did
send
them
to
him
as
he
once
asserted
they
did
not
appear
in
print
however
till
four
years
after
death
when
they
were
printed
apparently
without
pope
consent
in
a
volume
of
miscellanies
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
in
this
form
the
full
name
addison
appeared
in
the
last
line
some
time
later
pope
acknowledged
the
verses
and
printed
them
with
a
few
changes
in
his
of
substituting
the
more
decorous
a
for
the
addison
of
the
first
text
finally
he
worked
over
the
passage
again
and
inserted
it
for
a
purpose
that
will
be
shown
later
in
the
to
arbuthnot
it
is
not
worth
while
to
discuss
here
the
justice
or
injustice
of
this
famous
portrait
in
fact
the
question
hardly
deserves
to
be
raised
the
passage
is
admittedly
a
satire
and
a
satire
makes
no
claim
to
be
a
just
and
final
sentence
admitting
as
we
must
that
pope
was
in
the
wrong
in
his
quarrel
with
addison
we
may
well
admit
that
he
has
not
done
him
full
justice
but
we
must
equally
admit
that
the
picture
is
drawn
with
wonderful
skill
that
praise
and
blame
are
deftly
mingled
and
that
the
satire
is
all
the
more
severe
because
of
its
frank
admission
of
the
great
man
merits
and
it
must
also
be
said
that
pope
has
hit
off
some
of
the
faults
of
addison
character
his
coldness
his
his
quiet
sneer
his
indulgence
of
flattering
fools
in
a
way
that
none
of
his
biographers
have
done
that
pope
was
not
blind
to
addison
chief
merit
as
an
author
is
fully
shown
by
a
passage
in
a
later
poem
less
well
known
than
the
portrait
of
atticus
but
well
worth
quotation
after
speaking
of
the
licentiousness
of
literature
in
restoration
days
he
goes
on
to
say
in
our
own
excuse
some
courtly
stains
no
whiter
page
than
addison
remains
he
from
the
taste
obscene
reclaims
our
youth
and
sets
the
passions
on
the
side
of
truth
forms
the
soft
bosom
with
the
gentlest
art
and
pours
each
human
virtue
in
the
heart
to
augustus
ii
if
pope
was
unjust
to
addison
the
man
he
at
least
made
amends
to
addison
the
moralist
the
second
passage
that
may
have
had
an
independent
existence
before
the
was
conceived
is
the
portrait
of
bufo
ll
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
this
attack
was
first
aimed
at
bubb
doddington
a
courtier
of
hervey
class
though
hardly
of
so
finished
a
type
to
whom
pope
alludes
as
bubo
in
when
pope
was
working
on
the
however
he
saw
an
opportunity
to
vindicate
his
own
independence
of
patronage
by
a
satiric
portrait
of
the
great
maecenas
of
his
younger
days
lord
halifax
who
had
ventured
some
foolish
criticisms
on
translation
of
the
and
seems
to
have
expected
that
the
poet
should
dedicate
the
great
work
to
him
in
return
for
an
offer
of
a
pension
which
he
made
and
pope
declined
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
pope
cherished
any
very
bitter
resentment
toward
halifax
on
the
contrary
in
a
poem
published
some
years
after
the
he
boasted
of
his
friendship
with
halifax
naming
him
outright
and
adding
in
a
note
that
the
noble
lord
was
no
less
distinguished
by
his
love
of
letters
than
his
abilities
in
parliament
the
third
passage
a
tender
reference
to
his
mother
age
and
weakness
was
written
at
least
as
early
as
pope
died
in
and
was
incorporated
in
the
to
round
it
off
with
a
picture
of
the
poet
absorbed
in
his
filial
duties
at
the
very
time
that
hervey
and
lady
mary
were
heaping
abuse
upon
him
as
a
monster
devoid
of
all
good
qualities
and
now
having
discussed
the
various
insertions
in
the
let
us
look
for
a
moment
at
the
poem
as
a
whole
and
see
what
is
the
nature
of
pope
defense
of
himself
and
of
his
reply
to
his
enemies
it
is
cast
in
the
form
of
a
dialogue
between
the
poet
himself
and
arbuthnot
pope
begins
by
complaining
of
the
misfortunes
which
his
reputation
as
a
successful
man
of
letters
has
brought
upon
him
he
is
a
mark
for
all
the
starving
scribblers
of
the
town
who
besiege
him
for
advice
recommendations
and
hard
cash
is
it
not
enough
to
make
a
man
write
arbuthnot
warns
him
against
the
danger
of
making
foes
ll
but
pope
replies
that
his
flatterers
are
even
more
intolerable
than
his
open
enemies
and
with
a
little
outburst
of
impatience
such
as
we
may
well
imagine
him
to
have
indulged
in
during
his
later
years
he
cries
why
did
i
write
what
sin
to
me
unknown
dipt
me
in
ink
my
parents
or
my
own
and
begins
with
his
poetical
autobiography
he
tells
of
his
first
childish
efforts
of
poetry
taken
up
to
help
me
thro
this
long
disease
my
life
and
then
goes
on
to
speak
of
the
noble
and
famous
friends
who
had
praised
his
early
work
and
urged
him
to
try
his
fortune
in
the
open
field
of
letters
he
speaks
of
his
first
poems
the
and
forest
harmless
as
hervey
own
verses
and
tells
how
even
then
critics
like
dennis
fell
foul
of
him
rival
authors
hated
him
too
especially
such
pilfering
bards
as
philips
this
he
could
endure
but
the
coldness
and
even
jealousy
of
such
a
man
as
addison
and
here
appears
the
famous
portrait
of
atticus
was
another
matter
serious
enough
to
draw
tears
from
all
lovers
of
mankind
passing
on
to
the
days
of
his
great
success
when
his
was
the
talk
of
the
town
he
asserts
his
ignorance
of
all
the
arts
of
puffery
and
his
independence
of
mutual
admiration
societies
he
left
those
who
wished
a
patron
to
the
tender
mercies
of
halifax
who
fed
fat
on
flattery
and
repaid
his
flatterers
merely
with
a
good
word
or
a
seat
at
his
table
after
all
the
poet
could
afford
to
lose
the
society
of
bufo
toadies
while
such
a
friend
as
gay
was
left
him
after
an
eloquent
expression
of
his
wish
for
independence
ll
he
goes
on
to
speak
of
the
babbling
friends
who
insist
that
he
is
always
meditating
some
new
satire
and
persist
in
recognizing
some
wretched
poetaster
lampoon
as
his
and
so
by
a
natural
transition
pope
comes
to
speak
of
his
own
satiric
poems
and
their
aims
he
says
and
rightly
that
he
has
never
attacked
virtue
or
innocence
he
reserves
his
lash
for
those
who
trample
on
their
neighbors
and
insult
fallen
worth
for
cold
or
treacherous
friends
liars
and
babbling
blockheads
let
sporus
hervey
tremble
arbuthnot
interposes
herewith
an
ejaculation
of
contemptuous
pity
is
it
really
worth
the
poet
while
to
castigate
such
a
slight
thing
as
hervey
that
mere
white
curd
but
pope
has
suffered
too
much
from
hervey
insolence
to
stay
his
hand
and
he
now
proceeds
to
lay
on
the
lash
with
equal
fury
and
precision
drawing
blood
at
every
stroke
until
we
seem
to
see
the
wretched
fop
writhing
and
shrieking
beneath
the
whip
and
then
with
a
magnificent
transition
he
goes
on
ll
to
draw
a
portrait
of
himself
here
he
says
in
effect
is
the
real
man
that
sporus
has
so
maligned
the
portrait
is
idealized
of
course
one
could
hardly
expect
a
poet
speaking
in
his
own
defense
in
reply
to
venomous
attacks
to
dissect
his
own
character
with
the
stern
impartiality
of
the
critics
of
the
succeeding
century
but
it
is
in
all
essentials
a
portrait
at
once
impressive
and
true
arbuthnot
again
interrupts
to
ask
why
he
spares
neither
the
poor
nor
the
great
in
his
satire
and
pope
replies
that
he
hates
knaves
in
every
rank
of
life
yet
by
nature
he
insists
he
is
of
an
easy
temper
more
readily
deceived
than
angered
and
in
a
long
catalogue
of
instances
he
illustrates
his
own
patience
and
good
nature
ll
it
must
be
frankly
confessed
that
these
lines
do
not
ring
true
pope
might
in
the
heat
of
argument
convince
himself
that
he
was
humble
and
slow
to
wrath
but
he
has
never
succeeded
in
convincing
his
readers
with
pope
turns
to
the
defense
of
his
family
which
as
we
have
seen
his
enemies
had
abused
as
base
and
obscure
he
draws
a
noble
picture
of
his
dead
father
by
nature
honest
by
experience
wise
simple
modest
and
temperate
and
passes
to
the
description
of
himself
watching
over
the
last
years
of
his
old
mother
his
sole
care
to
explore
the
thought
explain
the
asking
eye
and
keep
a
while
one
parent
from
the
sky
if
the
length
of
days
which
heaven
has
promised
those
who
honor
father
and
mother
fall
to
his
lot
may
heaven
preserve
him
such
a
friend
as
arbuthnot
to
bless
those
days
and
arbuthnot
closes
the
dialogue
with
a
word
which
is
meant
i
think
to
sum
up
the
whole
discussion
and
to
pronounce
the
verdict
that
pope
life
had
been
good
and
honorable
whether
that
blessing
be
deny
or
thus
far
was
right
the
rest
belongs
to
it
seems
hardly
necessary
to
point
out
the
merits
of
so
patent
a
masterpiece
as
the
to
arbuthnot
in
order
to
enjoy
it
to
the
full
indeed
one
must
know
something
of
the
life
of
the
author
of
the
circumstances
under
which
it
was
written
and
in
general
of
the
social
and
political
life
of
the
time
but
even
without
this
special
knowledge
no
reader
can
fail
to
appreciate
the
marvelous
ease
fluency
and
poignancy
of
this
admirable
satire
there
is
nothing
like
it
in
our
language
except
pope
other
satires
and
of
all
his
satires
it
is
by
common
consent
easily
the
first
it
surpasses
the
satiric
poetry
of
dryden
in
pungency
and
depth
of
feeling
as
easily
as
it
does
that
of
byron
in
polish
and
artistic
restraint
its
range
of
tone
is
remarkable
at
times
it
reads
like
glorified
conversation
as
in
the
opening
lines
at
times
it
flames
and
quivers
with
emotion
as
in
the
assault
on
hervey
or
in
the
defense
of
his
parents
even
in
the
limited
field
of
satiric
portraiture
there
is
a
wide
difference
between
the
manner
in
which
pope
has
drawn
the
portrait
of
atticus
and
that
of
sporus
the
latter
is
a
masterpiece
of
pure
invective
no
allowances
are
made
no
lights
relieve
the
darkness
of
the
shadows
the
portrait
is
frankly
inhuman
it
is
the
product
of
an
unrestrained
outburst
of
bitter
passion
the
portrait
of
atticus
on
the
other
hand
was
as
we
know
the
work
of
years
it
is
the
product
not
of
an
outburst
of
fury
but
of
a
slowly
growing
and
intense
dislike
which
while
recognizing
the
merits
of
its
object
fastened
with
peculiar
power
upon
his
faults
and
weaknesses
the
studious
restraint
which
controls
the
satirist
hand
makes
it
only
the
more
effective
we
know
well
enough
that
the
portrait
is
not
a
fair
one
but
we
are
forced
to
remind
ourselves
of
this
at
every
step
to
avoid
the
spell
which
pope
apparent
impartiality
casts
over
our
judgments
the
whole
passage
reads
not
so
much
like
the
heated
plea
of
an
advocate
as
the
measured
of
a
judge
and
the
last
couplet
falls
on
our
ears
with
the
inevitability
of
a
final
sentence
but
the
peculiar
merit
of
the
to
arbuthnot
consists
neither
in
the
ease
and
polish
of
its
style
nor
in
the
vigor
and
effectiveness
of
its
satire
but
in
the
insight
it
gives
us
into
the
heart
and
mind
of
the
poet
himself
it
presents
an
ideal
picture
of
pope
the
man
and
the
author
of
his
life
his
friendships
his
love
of
his
parents
his
literary
relationships
and
aims
and
it
is
quite
futile
to
object
as
some
critics
have
done
that
this
picture
is
not
exactly
in
accordance
with
the
known
facts
of
pope
life
no
great
man
can
be
tried
and
judged
on
the
mere
record
of
his
acts
we
must
know
the
circumstances
that
shaped
these
and
the
motives
that
inspired
them
a
man
ideals
if
genuinely
held
and
honestly
followed
are
perhaps
even
more
valuable
contributions
to
our
final
estimate
of
the
man
himself
than
all
he
did
or
left
undone

could

recognize
in

ideals
of
independence
of
devotion
to
his
art
of
simple

loyal
friendship
and
of
filial
piety
which
shine

gross

there
are
several
variations
between
this

form

that
in
which

it
is
probable
that

thought
enough
of

it
to

spirit
is
characteristic
of
a
side
of

nature
that
is

was
indeed
the
poet
of
the
society

his

urban
cultured
and
but
to
the
end
of
his
days
he
retained
a
love
for
the
quiet
charm
of
country
life
which
he
had
come
to
feel
in
his
boyhood
at
binfield

majesty
to
destroy

to
substitute
the

of

daringly
irreverent
speculations
of

close

faltering
with
emotion
