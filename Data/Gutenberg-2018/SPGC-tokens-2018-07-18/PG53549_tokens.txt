john
de
witt
republican
a
man
of
unwearied
industry
inflexible
constancy
sound
clear
and
deep
understanding
and
untainted
integrity
so
that
whenever
he
was
blinded
it
was
by
the
passion
that
he
had
for
that
which
he
esteemed
the
good
and
interest
of
the
sir
william
temple
on
the
united
chapter
i
the
ideals
of
de
witt
there
is
one
subject
that
we
seldom
touch
upon
said
sir
william
and
that
is
one
upon
which
i
am
curious
to
hear
you
john
de
witt
looked
up
quickly
ah
sir
he
smiled
faintly
you
are
of
a
probing
disposition
what
is
this
subject
the
the
prince
repeated
de
witt
and
an
intent
expression
that
might
have
been
trouble
came
into
his
full
brown
eyes
what
is
there
to
say
of
his
highness
he
added
the
english
ambassador
laughed
in
the
soft
and
pleasant
way
he
had
he
was
standing
by
the
long
window
and
as
he
answered
glanced
out
at
the
wych
elms
and
pale
sunshine
that
filled
the
garden
of
de
witt
the
situation
is
piquant
between
good
friends
you
must
allow
it
the
grand
pensionary
rose
between
good
friends
sir
william
the
situation
is
dangerous
i
am
aware
of
it
but
the
prince
the
prince
is
only
a
sir
william
moved
from
the
window
with
a
little
shiver
your
dutch
weather
he
said
i
think
the
damp
has
got
into
my
very
bones
but
you
like
the
house
asked
de
witt
it
hath
a
large
garden
for
the
children
when
they
stay
with
me
and
since
it
was
not
possible
to
remain
where
i
was
i
thought
i
could
do
no
sir
william
answered
gently
aware
of
the
allusion
veiled
under
commonplace
words
to
the
late
death
of
wendela
de
witt
it
seemed
to
him
composed
and
close
observer
as
he
was
even
of
his
friends
that
the
grand
pensionary
had
changed
more
than
a
little
since
he
had
lost
his
wife
it
is
a
noble
mansion
he
said
i
could
be
selfish
enough
to
wish
this
library
at
he
looked
with
the
approval
of
a
fine
taste
round
the
lofty
apartment
panelled
in
carved
wood
and
lined
with
shelves
filled
with
rare
and
costly
volumes
a
few
handsome
portraits
hung
above
the
bookcases
and
over
the
high
a
rich
but
sombre
picture
of
fruit
and
flowers
showed
on
the
hearth
were
brass
andirons
and
on
the
table
in
the
centre
of
the
chamber
candlesticks
were
set
also
brass
but
polished
so
that
they
shone
like
gold
at
a
small
desk
by
the
far
window
sat
a
secretary
in
a
dark
dress
writing
the
house
hath
been
a
palace
continued
sir
william
therefore
should
not
be
the
residence
of
a
republican
smiled
john
de
witt
nay
he
added
simply
the
house
is
well
enough
but
i
took
it
for
the
garden
and
now
you
look
on
my
one
luxury
my
books
for
the
rest
the
furnishings
are
simple
too
simple
for
cornelia
s
taste
as
she
will
tell
you
if
you
stay
to
dinner
nay
i
doubt
not
she
tells
my
lady
sir
william
crossed
to
one
of
the
bookcases
took
a
volume
down
and
opened
it
at
random
as
john
de
witt
came
up
behind
him
he
spoke
in
a
low
tone
looking
at
the
book
who
is
the
new
secretary
the
grand
pensionary
seemed
slightly
surprised
he
a
young
man
from
he
glanced
to
where
the
person
in
question
sat
absorbed
in
writing
he
was
recommended
to
me
by
de
groot
he
is
diligent
and
silent
i
like
sir
william
s
white
fingers
slowly
turned
the
leaves
of
the
volume
he
held
then
we
may
talk
freely
as
always
in
my
the
englishman
glanced
up
his
face
which
was
of
a
dark
soft
luxurious
style
of
indolent
good
looks
expressed
a
watchful
yet
friendly
kind
of
amusement
and
interest
his
air
was
slightly
cynical
wholly
pleasant
as
if
viewing
follies
that
never
tempted
him
to
participate
in
them
he
yet
found
them
harmless
and
tolerated
them
well
then
of
the
prince
he
said
what
are
you
going
to
do
john
de
witt
frowned
you
think
i
am
afraid
of
his
sir
william
answered
with
the
ready
courtesy
that
took
all
appearance
of
sincerity
from
his
speech
all
europe
knows
that
you
are
afraid
of
nothing
yet
for
holland
s
sake
you
might
tremble
a
little
the
cloud
did
not
lift
from
the
grand
pensionary
s
noble
face
he
put
out
his
hand
and
rested
it
on
the
edge
of
one
of
the
bookshelves
and
his
delicate
fingers
tapped
restlessly
on
the
polished
wood
diplomacy
as
well
as
friendship
dictates
frankness
to
me
he
answered
in
his
slow
stately
yet
gentle
way
nor
is
there
much
i
could
conceal
from
such
an
observer
as
yourself
sir
william
the
orange
party
have
wearied
me
have
thwarted
me
have
alarmed
me
i
find
them
unreasonable
powerful
and
dangerous
i
speak
of
the
party
not
of
the
why
not
of
him
i
have
no
right
he
has
ever
shown
himself
quiet
tractable
obedient
was
the
quick
reply
we
have
never
had
to
complain
of
his
yet
he
is
the
focus
for
much
discontent
smiled
the
englishman
the
magnet
for
much
the
grand
pensionary
smiled
also
uplifting
his
melancholy
eyes
his
highness
is
but
seventeen
immersed
in
study
brought
up
as
a
republican
i
think
he
is
even
ignorant
of
these
agitations
in
his
name
he
could
not
live
more
but
it
did
not
escape
sir
william
that
the
grand
pensionary
spoke
like
a
man
trying
to
reassure
himself
the
prince
is
your
pupil
forgive
me
but
as
i
said
the
situation
is
curious
you
sir
a
republican
for
seventeen
years
the
head
of
a
republic
which
has
been
a
fine
nation
and
a
wealthy
and
a
lesson
to
all
of
us
you
undertake
the
education
of
a
prince
who
is
the
heir
of
the
house
on
whose
ruin
you
founded
your
republic
you
bring
this
young
man
up
in
your
ideas
you
teach
him
this
that
as
you
will
you
are
not
his
master
but
his
friend
he
is
to
regard
himself
as
a
mere
citizen
of
the
country
that
is
his
heritage
well
it
is
a
curious
experiment
mynheer
de
the
grand
pensionary
answered
quietly
i
have
done
all
i
can
since
we
speak
privately
not
as
politicians
i
will
say
that
i
have
no
hope
to
always
exclude
his
highness
from
all
power
i
think
that
when
he
comes
of
age
he
will
obtain
the
command
of
the
army
nor
do
i
regret
it
the
house
of
orange
has
rendered
such
service
to
holland
that
there
should
be
some
gratitude
some
trust
shown
this
sir
william
closed
the
book
he
held
and
replaced
it
on
the
shelf
meanwhile
i
train
him
to
serve
his
country
continued
de
witt
with
a
faint
smile
you
serve
your
country
well
mynheer
remarked
the
englishman
watching
him
i
serve
my
ideals
said
the
grand
pensionary
the
englishman
very
slightly
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
these
days
you
have
been
successful
but
i
should
watch
this
little
prince
we
stand
firm
the
triple
alliance
the
treaty
of
breda
the
perpetual
edict
quoted
de
witt
the
diplomat
who
had
framed
the
first
had
never
approved
of
the
last
there
you
went
too
far
he
said
there
i
secured
the
liberty
of
holland
answered
the
grand
pensionary
still
with
that
faint
smile
on
his
full
finely
cut
mouth
and
made
impossible
a
recurrence
of
this
prince
s
father
brought
his
troops
to
the
gates
of
amsterdam
no
man
shall
do
that
again
by
abolishing
the
office
of
stadtholder
i
do
away
with
the
fear
of
a
king
and
so
sir
secure
my
amen
to
that
answered
sir
william
you
have
the
confidence
of
the
idealist
i
love
you
for
it
but
i
can
not
be
so
sanguine
the
prince
if
he
is
heir
to
nothing
else
hath
the
name
the
prestige
and
that
is
a
strange
spell
to
work
with
the
he
looked
as
he
spoke
with
the
interest
of
the
worldly
man
at
a
noble
simplicity
he
admires
but
can
not
comprehend
john
de
witt
was
his
friend
they
had
much
in
common
respected
each
other
s
character
and
talents
but
sir
william
temple
had
never
ceased
to
marvel
at
john
de
witt
the
grand
pensionary
was
silent
a
deep
thoughtfulness
came
into
his
face
the
englishman
watched
him
smiling
a
little
coldly
do
you
think
that
i
am
not
loved
in
the
united
provinces
asked
de
witt
suddenly
sir
william
fingered
the
ends
of
his
cravat
the
other
did
not
wait
for
an
answer
so
leisurely
composed
this
young
man
is
popular
it
sometimes
seems
sir
william
as
if
he
was
heir
to
the
heart
of
the
people
he
has
the
the
name
and
with
the
people
is
not
that
everything
i
think
nothing
weighs
against
the
name
the
prince
does
little
to
make
himself
beloved
but
there
are
those
who
clamour
for
him
as
if
he
owned
his
ancestor
s
virtues
with
his
ancestor
s
and
again
de
witt
repeated
the
name
then
as
if
resolute
to
close
the
subject
he
laid
his
hand
familiarly
on
sir
william
s
velvet
sleeve
will
you
not
come
into
the
garden
the
gardens
i
have
two
that
open
into
one
but
you
know
too
much
my
poor
trees
will
be
they
crossed
the
room
and
stepped
out
of
the
high
window
the
young
secretary
from
guelders
leant
back
in
his
chair
and
watched
them
walking
under
the
elms
not
a
word
of
their
conversation
had
been
lost
on
him
and
now
that
he
could
no
longer
hear
what
they
said
he
pondered
in
his
quick
yet
laborious
way
over
their
previous
speech
he
had
been
in
de
witt
s
service
a
week
it
was
in
the
course
of
his
duty
to
overhear
diplomatic
talk
to
read
and
make
notes
on
political
papers
and
though
he
had
always
considered
himself
well
informed
he
began
to
find
that
what
was
knowledge
in
guelders
was
ignorance
at
the
hague
he
reviewed
rather
sourly
the
change
in
his
feelings
this
week
had
brought
about
he
had
been
so
proud
of
the
post
so
grateful
for
de
groot
s
recommendation
so
confident
of
what
his
own
energy
and
industry
would
do
for
him
and
now
he
did
not
feel
at
all
confident
not
that
his
trust
in
himself
was
diminished
but
he
had
already
begun
to
doubt
if
he
had
taken
his
services
to
the
best
market
or
pledged
himself
to
the
most
profitable
of
masters
he
bit
his
quill
and
fixed
his
eyes
on
de
witt
who
was
standing
not
far
away
on
the
gravel
path
talking
to
his
companion
the
secretary
marked
with
a
calculating
glance
the
grand
pensionary
s
stately
figure
clothed
sombrely
in
black
his
pale
oval
face
under
jawed
the
full
but
curiously
firm
and
mouth
shaded
by
the
slight
moustache
the
large
weary
brown
eyes
the
high
brow
over
which
fell
the
soft
dark
hair
that
was
just
beginning
to
be
touched
with
grey
and
contrasted
his
melancholy
noble
air
with
the
vivacious
ease
of
the
splendid
englishman
whose
rich
comeliness
was
enhanced
by
his
elegant
and
costly
dress
as
he
looked
the
young
man
from
guelders
wondered
de
witt
had
been
grand
pensionary
of
the
united
provinces
for
seventeen
years
the
secretary
had
long
taken
him
for
granted
as
something
always
there
immovable
as
the
law
he
represented
and
had
no
more
questioned
the
authority
than
he
had
the
power
of
this
first
magistrate
of
the
republic
only
with
difficulty
and
by
forcing
his
mind
back
to
his
childhood
could
he
recall
something
of
the
famous
d
that
had
made
de
witt
head
of
the
state
he
recollected
dimly
the
excitement
that
had
filled
the
country
when
the
young
stadtholder
william
the
second
had
tried
to
seize
amsterdam
and
the
absolute
power
of
a
king
he
remembered
going
with
other
boys
of
his
own
age
to
break
the
windows
of
a
house
that
had
sported
orange
favours
and
being
rebuked
by
the
minister
and
made
to
stay
longer
in
the
gaunt
white
church
praying
for
strength
to
curb
his
feelings
he
remembered
too
the
news
of
the
sudden
death
of
the
prince
who
had
threatened
their
liberties
and
how
they
had
thanked
god
for
it
solemnly
after
that
there
had
been
the
republic
which
he
had
taken
unquestioningly
de
witt
stood
for
the
united
provinces
as
for
the
last
prince
of
orange
born
after
his
father
s
death
the
heir
of
a
fallen
house
the
secretary
had
never
heard
much
of
him
there
had
been
quarrels
as
to
his
education
between
de
witt
and
his
uncle
the
elector
between
his
grandmother
and
his
mother
the
english
the
secretary
remembered
hearing
without
interest
of
the
death
of
this
lady
in
england
and
of
how
her
son
more
than
ever
a
state
prisoner
was
being
educated
by
de
witt
there
seemed
no
reason
why
he
florent
van
mander
of
the
town
of
arnheim
a
prudent
able
young
dutchman
honourably
and
profitably
employed
in
the
service
of
the
grand
pensionary
should
be
so
laboriously
recalling
every
detail
he
had
ever
heard
of
william
of
orange
but
two
things
had
taken
hold
of
a
nature
naturally
observant
cautious
yet
energetic
and
aspiring
the
first
was
the
conviction
that
de
witt
held
a
position
by
no
means
as
secure
as
it
seemed
a
position
that
despite
the
treaty
of
breda
despite
the
triple
alliance
was
one
that
he
the
new
secretary
must
watch
carefully
if
he
would
not
be
entangled
in
a
falling
cause
and
the
second
was
the
impression
that
this
youth
the
son
of
the
late
stadtholder
was
a
latent
force
in
holland
that
might
one
day
become
tremendous
overwhelming
he
has
the
name
sir
william
temple
had
said
and
the
words
had
seized
florent
van
mander
s
slow
but
not
dull
imagination
he
thought
that
the
englishman
had
expressed
less
than
he
felt
and
longed
to
hear
him
again
on
the
subject
he
had
only
seen
sir
william
twice
but
there
was
something
in
his
easy
almost
careless
manner
in
the
slightly
disdainful
shrewdness
of
his
remarks
that
inspired
the
secretary
with
a
respect
he
did
not
entertain
for
john
de
witt
he
had
an
uncomfortable
feeling
that
the
grand
pensionary
was
a
man
who
might
be
without
much
difficulty
fooled
i
serve
my
ideals
he
had
said
that
annoyed
van
mander
he
had
not
a
very
clear
conception
of
an
idealist
but
he
was
tolerably
certain
that
no
man
could
be
one
and
still
be
successful
in
a
practical
way
and
it
had
struck
him
as
a
pointless
and
rather
weak
thing
to
say
i
serve
my
he
had
noted
other
remarks
too
of
the
same
trend
a
certain
loftiness
of
outlook
an
unworldly
tolerance
of
detraction
and
malice
that
did
not
please
him
he
would
have
preferred
a
master
more
eagerly
alive
to
his
own
advantage
more
conscious
of
evil
in
others
and
prepared
to
fight
it
on
its
own
grounds
sir
william
had
also
said
other
things
that
remained
in
the
young
secretary
s
mind
he
had
spoken
of
the
curious
situation
the
republican
minister
instructing
and
watching
the
prince
at
once
tutor
and
jailer
and
florent
van
mander
thought
that
it
was
indeed
curious
and
a
little
foolish
too
on
the
part
of
john
de
witt
and
there
were
yet
other
aspects
of
the
situation
that
the
previous
conversation
had
not
touched
on
but
which
were
nevertheless
present
to
the
roused
mind
of
the
secretary
this
prince
was
cousin
of
the
king
of
france
a
figure
of
dazzling
and
alarming
greatness
and
nephew
of
the
king
of
england
and
both
these
were
of
an
aspect
menacing
to
the
republic
true
there
was
the
triple
alliance
but
the
young
secretary
became
aware
that
he
had
bitten
his
pen
till
it
was
split
and
useless
and
he
laid
it
down
with
a
vexed
look
he
greatly
disliked
to
do
anything
careless
or
unmethodical
or
even
to
become
absorbed
in
reflections
not
in
themselves
necessary
to
present
business
he
took
out
another
quill
mended
it
and
glanced
again
out
of
the
window
the
grand
pensionary
and
sir
william
had
been
joined
by
agneta
de
witt
a
pale
graceful
child
and
cornelia
van
bicker
the
mistress
of
the
house
looking
at
these
ladies
moving
under
the
shifting
pale
shadows
of
the
trees
the
young
man
s
rather
hard
eyes
softened
he
had
the
dutchman
s
intense
respect
for
domestic
affections
and
to
think
of
the
recent
death
of
wendela
de
witt
moved
him
he
had
never
seen
her
but
he
knew
that
she
had
been
good
and
gentle
patient
and
adoring
like
her
daughter
agneta
and
he
guessed
at
the
great
loneliness
that
her
loss
had
left
in
the
heart
of
john
de
witt
he
thought
of
it
whenever
he
saw
her
sister
cornelia
van
bicker
or
one
of
her
quiet
children
as
he
watched
the
little
party
turned
towards
the
house
sir
william
in
his
velvet
ruffled
with
ribbon
his
heavy
curls
falling
round
his
handsome
face
walking
beside
the
grand
pensionary
who
had
no
relief
to
his
black
garments
save
his
broad
linen
collar
and
between
them
the
little
figure
of
agneta
in
her
white
gown
and
prim
cap
holding
herself
soberly
while
before
them
moved
the
sister
of
wendela
de
witt
plainly
dressed
with
the
fading
changing
sunlight
flickering
over
her
dark
dress
florent
van
mander
returned
to
the
letter
he
was
copying
for
he
observed
the
grand
pensionary
was
leaving
the
others
and
returning
to
the
library
when
de
witt
opened
the
window
and
entered
he
rose
waiting
his
instructions
i
have
finished
these
documents
mynheer
he
said
pointing
to
some
papers
given
him
by
another
secretary
van
ouvenaller
thought
they
should
be
copied
in
case
you
care
to
submit
them
to
their
high
what
are
they
asked
john
de
witt
he
always
spoke
gently
and
courteously
van
mander
found
himself
noticing
it
letters
from
the
provinces
mynheer
he
answered
dealing
with
the
riots
in
the
name
of
the
prince
of
orange
ah
the
grand
pensionary
frowned
thoughtfully
the
burgomasters
should
be
able
to
deal
with
it
seems
in
zeeland
you
have
a
letter
from
zeeland
from
mynheer
van
teel
one
michael
tichelaer
is
inciting
the
people
to
violence
in
michael
tichelaer
de
witt
repeated
thoughtfully
yes
i
remember
the
man
i
must
write
to
mynheer
van
he
paused
a
moment
then
added
i
fear
we
are
too
the
secretary
sorted
and
neatly
arranged
the
papers
it
was
not
his
place
to
offer
comment
but
there
were
many
things
that
he
burned
to
say
meanwhile
the
grand
pensionary
was
regarding
him
with
a
kindly
if
remote
interest
the
young
man
had
been
warmly
recommended
for
zeal
and
industry
and
so
far
he
had
found
both
he
saw
too
for
himself
resolution
and
capacity
in
the
blunt
firm
features
in
the
alert
grey
eyes
and
erect
figure
you
are
satisfied
with
your
position
mynheer
van
mander
he
asked
quite
mynheer
the
secretary
precisely
tied
the
ribbons
of
the
portfolio
is
it
not
an
enviable
one
you
may
make
it
so
answered
john
de
witt
quietly
yet
with
a
kind
of
glow
in
his
voice
because
you
are
in
the
way
to
serve
your
country
and
that
is
indeed
an
enviable
florent
van
mander
was
silent
his
country
was
not
much
in
his
thoughts
he
meant
to
serve
success
i
think
there
is
nothing
more
said
de
witt
you
will
be
wishing
to
get
home
have
you
comfortable
lodgings
he
added
kindly
yes
mynheer
in
the
you
must
dine
with
us
soon
will
you
leave
out
the
letter
from
middelburg
i
need
not
remind
you
to
be
early
in
the
morning
there
is
somewhat
to
do
de
witt
smiled
in
his
melancholy
half
tender
half
distant
fashion
and
left
the
room
florent
van
mander
put
away
the
papers
setting
aside
in
an
upper
drawer
the
letter
from
van
teel
locked
the
desk
and
placed
the
key
on
his
the
sunlight
in
the
garden
was
taking
on
a
deeper
hue
and
flushing
the
walls
of
the
library
and
the
bookcases
to
a
colour
the
leaves
of
the
wych
elms
shook
in
a
trembling
joyous
kind
of
life
and
motion
in
the
strong
yet
gentle
breeze
that
was
arising
the
deep
solemn
chimes
of
the
groote
kerk
struck
six
it
was
later
than
the
secretary
had
supposed
he
usually
had
his
dinner
at
this
hour
he
took
his
eyes
from
the
quiet
beauty
of
the
garden
and
hastened
to
leave
the
house
the
door
was
open
as
he
passed
down
the
hall
and
he
had
a
glimpse
of
the
company
gathered
round
the
plainly
furnished
table
john
de
witt
at
the
head
of
it
saying
grace
with
an
earnest
composure
cornelia
van
bicker
standing
with
folded
hands
the
bright
english
face
of
lady
temple
above
her
falling
lace
collar
and
sir
william
tolerant
amused
and
placid
the
young
secretary
passed
out
into
the
street
the
sunshine
was
pleasant
down
the
kneuterdyk
avenue
bright
in
the
windows
of
the
houses
opposite
and
gay
in
the
trees
that
were
just
turning
a
faint
tint
of
yellow
a
saltish
breeze
touched
van
mander
s
face
it
was
blowing
straight
across
the
flat
country
up
from
the
sea
at
scheveningen
and
brought
with
it
memories
of
the
dunes
the
sand
and
the
foam
an
unnamable
an
unreal
excitement
stole
into
the
blood
that
usually
ran
so
coolly
just
as
if
the
young
man
had
suddenly
heard
commanding
music
or
seen
a
flag
flung
out
against
the
sky
this
feeling
had
been
with
him
slightly
ever
since
he
had
entered
the
service
of
john
de
witt
it
culminated
in
the
englishman
s
words
he
thought
he
has
the
florent
van
mander
could
not
forget
that
remark
nor
the
tone
in
which
it
was
spoken
it
seemed
to
give
the
clue
to
his
own
restlessness
his
curiosity
as
to
the
prince
his
discontent
with
his
new
master
the
name
the
sense
of
it
the
power
were
about
him
in
the
keen
breeze
in
the
sunlit
trees
in
the
whole
atmosphere
of
the
royal
hague
as
he
turned
home
he
repeated
it
to
himself
william
of
chapter
ii
the
intriguers
florent
van
mander
comfortable
after
his
dinner
sitting
at
his
open
window
smoking
and
watching
the
people
pass
up
and
down
the
kerkestraat
was
surprised
not
disagreeably
by
the
servant
entering
his
solitude
to
announce
a
visitor
owning
a
foreign
name
she
stumbled
over
hyacinthe
croix
van
mander
had
known
him
in
arnheim
when
he
himself
was
a
magistrate
s
clerk
there
ambitious
with
an
eye
on
the
hague
and
the
frenchman
a
half
disavowed
agent
of
the
marquis
de
pomponne
some
one
who
had
travelled
the
provinces
several
times
already
observing
noting
making
acquaintances
and
gathering
information
where
he
could
the
young
secretary
called
for
candles
he
had
been
sitting
in
the
dark
and
closed
the
window
on
the
heels
of
the
maid
with
the
lights
came
croix
better
dressed
more
more
assured
in
manner
than
formerly
the
two
greeted
each
other
formally
i
did
not
know
that
you
were
at
the
hague
said
van
mander
how
did
you
find
me
the
frenchman
laid
his
hat
and
gloves
on
one
of
the
chairs
i
was
passing
through
arnheim
the
other
day
i
called
upon
your
uncle
and
he
told
me
you
have
a
good
florent
put
a
chair
for
his
guest
and
took
one
himself
the
other
side
of
the
small
dark
table
between
them
stood
the
two
heavy
branch
candlesticks
glimmering
each
in
the
light
of
the
other
candles
that
illuminated
the
small
neat
room
with
its
deep
polished
wood
furniture
plain
engravings
on
the
walls
and
delft
pottery
on
the
florent
refilled
his
pipe
and
invited
the
other
to
smoke
the
two
long
clays
soon
filled
the
chamber
with
slow
fragrant
smoke
so
you
are
in
the
service
of
de
witt
remarked
croix
the
frenchman
smiled
as
he
pondered
on
the
best
means
of
getting
what
he
wanted
from
the
laconic
dutchman
it
was
astonishingly
difficult
he
found
to
deal
with
a
nation
so
blunt
and
so
reserved
in
the
silence
that
followed
florent
stared
at
him
stolidly
marking
every
detail
of
his
appearance
his
short
red
jacket
of
the
newest
french
fashion
showing
the
laced
shirt
beneath
the
cravat
and
ruffles
of
lace
the
silk
stockings
and
shoes
with
ribbon
rosettes
the
frizzled
fair
hair
that
framed
the
rather
insignificant
face
of
hyacinthe
croix
van
mander
had
the
national
contempt
of
foreign
luxury
but
these
signs
of
prosperity
annoyed
him
in
a
slow
kind
of
way
he
knew
croix
was
of
the
small
gentry
no
better
born
than
himself
and
not
so
long
ago
no
better
dressed
now
he
contrasted
this
gay
attire
with
his
own
serviceable
grey
and
worsted
hose
and
wished
he
had
been
the
one
to
find
such
profitable
employment
how
do
you
like
de
witt
asked
croix
suddenly
very
well
said
florent
the
frenchman
regarded
him
out
of
narrowed
eyes
and
asked
again
with
equal
abruptness
have
you
seen
the
prince
of
orange
but
you
have
heard
since
you
have
been
at
the
hague
a
great
deal
of
him
i
have
heard
of
him
answered
florent
croix
laid
down
his
pipe
you
have
drawn
your
own
conclusions
of
course
he
said
you
were
always
florent
was
flattered
and
excited
he
managed
to
show
neither
feeling
i
have
drawn
some
conclusions
was
all
he
admitted
on
the
position
of
the
prince
and
of
de
witt
i
have
only
been
at
the
hague
a
week
but
hyacinthe
croix
knew
fairly
well
the
man
he
dealt
with
come
he
said
in
an
intimate
tone
that
swept
aside
evasion
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
this
government
must
the
words
gave
the
young
secretary
a
shock
he
sat
silent
sucking
his
pipe
not
wishing
to
admit
that
he
was
startled
the
frenchman
leant
back
calmly
in
his
chair
the
whole
feeling
of
the
country
is
against
de
witt
he
continued
you
must
have
seen
it
occurred
to
florent
in
a
vague
impersonal
sort
of
way
that
the
grand
pensionary
s
secretary
had
no
right
to
be
listening
to
these
things
or
even
to
be
speaking
at
all
to
a
frenchman
intriguing
for
his
ambassador
but
he
told
himself
that
he
served
success
and
success
did
not
seem
to
lie
with
de
witt
yet
we
are
at
peace
at
home
and
abroad
he
remarked
to
probe
the
other
croix
smiled
you
think
of
the
triple
alliance
he
said
true
only
signed
this
year
returned
florent
still
there
is
always
also
do
not
be
too
sure
of
england
said
croix
despite
the
triple
alliance
she
stands
very
well
with
france
i
could
tell
you
something
florent
van
mander
looked
him
straight
in
the
face
do
you
mean
that
france
and
england
might
combine
for
the
restoration
of
the
prince
of
orange
the
frenchman
lifted
his
eyebrows
upon
conditions
they
might
if
there
were
a
war
what
could
de
witt
do
van
mander
thought
a
moment
he
beat
england
in
but
now
he
could
do
nothing
against
france
that
is
yes
it
is
obvious
admitted
florent
and
the
prospect
is
i
know
well
you
see
the
part
the
prince
will
play
there
was
a
little
pause
then
the
dutchman
said
slowly
he
is
king
louis
cousin
and
king
charles
nephew
you
take
me
replied
croix
the
prince
is
related
to
their
majesties
and
he
has
no
cause
to
love
de
florent
drew
a
quick
breath
you
think
he
would
work
for
france
can
there
be
a
doubt
of
it
smiled
croix
there
was
no
answer
from
florent
he
laid
down
his
pipe
and
sat
still
considering
rumours
whispers
hints
were
taking
at
last
tangible
form
this
young
prisoner
pupil
of
de
witt
was
to
be
the
instrument
to
deliver
the
country
into
the
rapacious
hands
of
france
well
there
was
little
cause
to
wonder
indeed
he
had
almost
guessed
it
the
prince
had
as
croix
said
little
cause
to
love
either
de
witt
or
his
republic
he
raised
his
grey
eyes
and
looked
into
the
frenchman
s
face
these
are
strange
things
to
say
to
a
dutchman
and
a
servant
of
de
croix
answered
quickly
but
you
serve
at
these
words
that
he
did
not
recall
having
ever
uttered
to
this
man
florent
was
again
silent
it
was
perfectly
true
he
was
at
the
beginning
of
his
career
and
ambitious
he
had
no
desire
to
follow
a
falling
cause
the
republic
was
no
more
to
him
than
the
prince
he
told
himself
and
there
was
no
reason
that
he
should
not
out
of
the
crisis
that
threatened
earn
a
place
and
distinction
for
himself
croix
observed
him
closely
he
was
not
afraid
of
having
said
too
much
for
he
had
read
his
man
some
years
before
in
guelders
it
seems
i
serve
the
wrong
master
now
said
florent
at
last
with
a
grim
set
to
his
mouth
i
must
not
look
out
for
fortune
in
the
train
of
de
the
frenchman
answered
slowly
and
with
meaning
there
is
fortune
and
great
fortune
to
be
found
in
the
service
of
de
witt
by
men
like
you
who
know
how
to
look
for
once
more
florent
was
silent
he
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
dark
surface
of
the
table
where
the
reflected
lights
of
the
candles
glimmered
he
thought
that
he
understood
the
prince
continued
croix
and
the
power
behind
the
prince
can
be
very
well
served
by
one
in
the
pay
of
de
florent
was
now
sure
that
he
understood
not
by
being
loyal
to
his
master
but
by
betraying
him
was
he
to
satisfy
his
ambitions
the
way
of
success
lay
not
with
the
grand
pensionary
but
with
the
prince
who
was
another
name
for
france
for
the
moment
his
instinct
was
to
resent
this
calm
suggestion
that
he
was
the
willing
instrument
of
foreign
intrigue
but
quick
reflection
showed
him
the
folly
of
it
croix
knew
him
some
time
past
in
guelders
he
had
taken
money
for
such
information
of
dutch
politics
as
he
could
command
his
hesitation
took
another
form
how
am
i
to
know
that
this
prince
of
yours
is
worth
serving
at
a
risk
he
said
you
know
that
france
is
worth
buat
died
remarked
florent
dryly
for
tampering
with
buat
was
a
fool
returned
croix
and
we
do
not
want
any
from
you
one
of
de
witt
s
secretaries
can
not
fail
to
be
useful
you
will
see
yes
i
see
how
answered
florent
but
at
present
de
witt
represents
the
government
and
the
law
and
the
prince
is
a
powerless
cipher
not
so
powerless
we
are
in
touch
with
him
he
commands
a
section
of
the
nobles
and
he
has
the
florent
hearing
again
the
words
used
by
sir
william
temple
started
inwardly
it
was
curious
that
the
name
that
owed
its
prestige
and
its
weight
to
the
fact
that
it
was
the
name
of
the
man
who
had
first
given
holland
her
liberty
was
to
be
used
now
to
aid
in
her
downfall
he
is
a
boy
said
van
mander
quickly
he
has
been
brought
up
by
de
witt
educated
as
a
republican
croix
smiled
is
de
witt
clever
enough
to
train
a
prince
into
a
commoner
i
do
not
think
interest
shone
in
florent
s
grey
eyes
how
far
has
the
prince
gone
with
france
he
is
of
an
extraordinary
caution
he
will
not
commit
himself
while
he
is
in
the
power
of
de
witt
but
take
it
from
me
that
he
does
not
love
has
he
cause
to
after
the
act
of
exclusion
his
only
hope
lies
in
england
and
france
and
he
knows
you
confirm
what
i
have
ever
heard
answered
florent
the
prince
is
only
a
a
cloak
to
cover
the
designs
of
croix
nodded
put
it
so
if
you
will
and
now
he
instinctively
lowered
his
voice
i
come
to
the
main
object
of
my
a
little
colour
flushed
florent
s
face
he
had
wondered
from
the
first
what
particular
meaning
there
could
be
in
croix
seeking
him
out
his
position
was
one
of
power
certainly
if
put
to
a
traitorous
use
but
de
pomponne
must
have
many
agents
and
spies
he
waited
you
will
understand
continued
croix
leaning
forward
across
the
table
that
the
prince
is
kept
very
close
his
governor
his
tutors
his
gentlemen
are
all
de
witt
s
men
and
practically
his
jailers
he
can
not
go
abroad
unattended
nor
receive
any
one
alone
his
letters
are
read
his
movements
his
speech
watched
it
is
almost
impossible
for
us
to
convey
to
him
any
message
le
marquis
de
pomponne
s
audiences
are
formal
and
always
under
the
eye
of
some
creature
of
de
witt
here
you
can
help
florent
still
waited
he
would
not
on
the
first
asking
have
betrayed
de
witt
wholesale
but
he
was
not
averse
to
some
service
to
the
other
side
the
frenchman
smoothed
down
the
ruffles
at
his
wrist
keeping
his
eyes
on
his
listener
m
de
witt
visits
the
prince
almost
every
day
tuesday
afternoons
he
devotes
to
instructing
him
in
politics
afterwards
going
to
the
assembly
in
the
binnenhof
it
is
his
practice
to
take
one
of
his
secretaries
with
him
it
would
be
possible
for
this
man
to
convey
a
packet
to
the
florent
answered
quietly
but
his
eyes
shone
you
want
me
to
try
a
servant
of
the
prince
whom
we
have
used
croix
went
on
as
a
has
lately
been
suspected
and
dismissed
by
de
witt
we
are
hard
put
to
it
for
a
means
to
communicate
with
the
florent
straightened
himself
in
the
stiff
chair
was
tuesday
van
ouvenaller
accompanied
de
witt
last
week
he
said
i
think
it
very
likely
that
de
witt
will
request
me
to
do
so
this
but
i
shall
be
left
in
the
croix
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
to
that
you
must
find
your
chance
better
wait
than
risk
i
leave
it
to
your
i
am
not
imprudent
smiled
florent
give
me
the
packet
if
i
go
i
will
attempt
it
if
not
i
can
as
you
say
the
frenchman
took
a
thick
folded
letter
from
the
inner
lining
of
his
red
coat
and
laid
it
on
the
table
between
them
if
that
reach
his
highness
safely
it
will
be
a
service
de
pomponne
will
not
forget
he
said
impressively
i
will
do
my
best
answered
florent
but
i
still
value
my
place
while
de
witt
is
grand
pensionary
i
think
it
worth
while
to
be
in
his
good
hyacinthe
croix
rose
france
has
her
heel
on
europe
he
said
with
the
help
of
this
little
prince
she
will
have
the
united
provinces
he
began
to
pull
on
his
fringed
gloves
i
give
this
government
two
three
years
no
there
is
england
remarked
florent
still
thinking
of
the
triple
alliance
england
like
sweden
may
take
her
price
returned
croix
florent
rose
too
the
politics
of
this
land
are
shaken
up
and
down
like
sand
tossed
in
the
palm
he
said
as
if
he
had
suddenly
roused
himself
i
am
in
the
employ
of
the
government
but
in
no
way
bound
to
any
master
tell
le
marquis
de
pomponne
so
as
de
witt
s
secretary
i
know
how
much
asked
croix
lacing
his
gloves
florent
answered
steadily
i
know
that
de
witt
is
of
france
of
england
of
william
of
he
hath
good
cause
answered
croix
he
picked
up
his
hat
with
the
fine
buckle
his
cloak
i
think
if
his
highness
once
gave
the
signal
the
whole
country
would
be
in
arms
there
is
a
strange
revulsion
of
feeling
against
this
ideal
republic
is
there
not
florent
was
taciturn
again
he
raised
one
of
the
brass
candlesticks
the
stairs
are
very
dark
he
said
and
opened
the
door
he
made
no
show
of
friendliness
or
hospitality
no
attempt
to
draw
the
frenchman
he
wanted
to
be
alone
when
shall
i
see
you
again
he
asked
croix
hitched
up
his
better
not
meet
here
again
nor
at
the
house
of
le
marquis
where
i
there
is
a
small
tavern
kept
by
a
frenchman
near
the
nieuwe
kerk
the
nieuwe
doelen
he
calls
it
we
may
meet
there
say
wednesday
evening
six
of
the
florent
came
out
on
to
the
landing
with
his
visitor
and
held
the
candle
so
that
a
flickering
radiance
was
cast
down
the
sombre
stairway
i
will
come
if
i
can
he
answered
slowly
said
croix
and
added
some
laughing
commonplace
for
the
benefit
of
any
who
might
be
in
hearing
florent
waited
with
the
light
until
the
gay
feather
and
mantle
had
disappeared
round
the
bend
of
the
stairs
then
he
returned
to
his
room
and
took
up
the
letter
left
by
croix
it
was
sealed
in
three
places
with
the
marquis
de
pomponne
s
signet
and
addressed
formally
to
his
highness
william
henry
prince
of
orange
nassau
as
if
the
scribe
had
enjoyed
writing
out
the
fine
titles
fine
titles
indeed
to
belong
to
an
insignificant
tool
of
france
but
florent
at
once
checked
that
foolish
reflection
the
prince
was
behaving
prudently
much
in
his
way
as
he
florent
van
mander
was
in
following
success
and
securing
his
own
ambitions
he
was
doing
in
fact
the
one
thing
there
was
for
him
to
do
a
bargain
with
france
or
england
was
his
one
means
of
escape
florent
turned
the
letter
over
he
was
curious
to
know
exactly
what
it
contained
he
wished
that
he
had
asked
croix
he
was
curious
also
to
see
the
prince
to
judge
him
for
himself
he
thrilled
with
unreasonable
excitement
at
the
thought
of
meeting
him
a
distant
threatening
noise
coming
from
the
street
below
made
him
quickly
put
the
letter
into
his
pocket
and
go
to
the
window
he
was
not
in
much
doubt
of
what
it
was
another
of
those
noisy
useless
orange
riots
dispersed
by
the
and
always
ignored
by
de
witt
a
handful
of
discontented
people
headed
by
boyish
enthusiasts
like
the
young
student
jacob
van
der
graef
florent
was
not
greatly
interested
in
them
he
leant
out
of
the
window
everything
had
faded
into
the
heavy
grey
of
a
cloudy
night
the
straight
lines
of
the
houses
opposite
the
great
tower
of
the
groote
kerk
the
poplar
tree
that
rustled
so
persistently
a
new
moon
clear
out
hard
shone
through
the
hurrying
vapours
by
the
feeble
glow
florent
could
see
some
people
running
up
the
street
towards
the
scene
of
the
riot
they
carried
sticks
and
swords
and
some
wore
orange
favours
he
smiled
cynically
to
himself
reflecting
how
little
they
knew
that
the
prince
whom
they
shouted
for
as
an
embodiment
of
all
patriotic
virtue
was
in
reality
sacrificing
them
to
their
greatest
enemy
bargaining
away
their
liberty
for
his
personal
advancement
they
are
mostly
fools
he
thought
and
shivered
back
from
the
sea
wind
closing
the
window
for
a
long
while
he
sat
silent
in
his
comfortable
room
smoking
and
staring
at
his
own
shadow
the
candlelight
cast
over
the
dark
walls
once
or
twice
he
took
the
letter
given
by
hyacinthe
croix
out
of
his
pocket
and
fingered
and
scrutinised
it
thinking
the
while
thinking
and
from
without
came
the
remote
sounds
of
the
students
fighting
shouting
tussling
with
the
in
the
name
of
william
of
orange
florent
van
mander
almost
envied
men
who
could
be
so
simple
chapter
iii
master
and
pupil
do
you
accompany
de
witt
asked
van
ouvenaller
florent
replied
without
looking
up
i
think
he
will
be
out
of
humour
remarked
the
other
secretary
i
do
not
mean
angry
like
other
men
but
the
note
of
admiration
in
his
voice
was
marked
florent
continued
docketing
the
papers
letters
from
england
before
him
van
ouvenaller
who
had
just
entered
the
library
stood
against
the
desk
looking
down
at
him
it
is
this
pastor
he
continued
he
has
very
ill
repaid
de
witt
s
mynheer
the
pastor
simon
simonides
inquired
florent
i
saw
him
why
did
he
come
here
by
the
order
of
their
high
mightinesses
answered
the
other
with
some
satisfaction
to
ask
de
witt
s
pardon
for
a
sermon
he
preached
some
days
ago
before
you
came
to
the
florent
glanced
up
a
treasonable
sermon
he
strove
to
stir
the
people
into
sedition
by
accusing
them
of
ingratitude
to
the
prince
of
orange
and
spoke
very
burningly
against
the
he
looked
sour
and
fierce
said
florent
but
de
witt
was
very
gracious
to
too
gracious
returned
van
ouvenaller
with
some
heat
he
said
as
sole
reproof
mynheer
you
have
outstepped
your
duty
which
is
to
heal
not
to
create
discord
and
with
that
made
him
stay
to
dinner
but
the
old
man
was
not
softened
he
left
as
hot
against
us
as
he
had
why
should
de
witt
care
asked
florent
van
ouvenaller
slightly
smiled
you
do
not
know
him
he
can
not
bear
to
feel
any
against
him
if
he
thinks
the
people
dislike
distrust
him
it
strikes
at
his
heart
it
is
the
same
with
the
prince
i
swear
that
since
mynheer
took
over
his
highness
education
his
one
idea
has
been
to
gain
his
the
speaker
s
worn
plain
face
lit
it
was
clear
he
admired
his
master
to
a
foolish
extent
florent
thought
van
ouvenaller
spoke
again
you
have
not
seen
the
prince
no
i
am
the
older
secretary
made
no
answer
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
picture
of
the
garden
seen
through
the
straight
window
with
the
afternoon
sunshine
in
the
trees
and
the
figure
of
agneta
de
witt
seated
in
the
shade
spinning
her
bible
beside
her
florent
gazed
too
this
must
be
dull
for
de
witt
s
van
ouvenaller
answered
quickly
they
do
not
live
here
but
with
de
witt
s
sister
at
dordt
this
is
a
then
without
them
smiled
florent
this
great
house
must
be
very
dull
it
is
quiet
said
van
ouvenaller
simply
but
one
is
too
immersed
in
affairs
to
notice
it
and
de
witt
will
always
live
quietly
now
madame
de
witt
is
then
he
drew
out
his
watch
and
added
in
a
changed
tone
m
de
witt
will
be
waiting
for
you
have
you
the
papers
florent
put
them
into
the
red
velvet
bag
that
went
daily
to
and
fro
in
the
hague
containing
as
a
foreigner
remarked
half
scornful
half
admiring
the
most
important
documents
in
europe
took
his
hat
and
cloak
from
the
wall
saluted
van
ouvenaller
and
stepped
into
the
hall
he
did
not
need
to
betake
himself
to
the
grand
pensionary
s
private
cabinet
for
john
de
witt
came
down
the
wide
pleasant
stairs
with
his
hat
on
you
are
he
smiled
drawing
on
his
gloves
slowly
he
was
entirely
in
black
save
for
his
falling
lace
collar
and
looked
pale
and
tired
i
have
been
a
little
delayed
we
go
first
mynheer
van
mander
to
his
highness
house
he
avoided
pointedly
the
word
palace
afterwards
to
the
florent
ventured
on
no
comment
he
half
resented
the
notable
simplicity
with
which
the
grand
pensionary
of
the
united
provinces
walked
through
the
streets
of
the
hague
attended
only
by
himself
carrying
the
famous
red
bag
of
what
use
was
power
he
thought
if
it
but
meant
the
taking
up
of
an
enormous
weight
of
cares
and
anxieties
and
receiving
in
return
the
treatment
of
an
ordinary
burgher
citizen
john
de
witt
did
not
speak
as
they
went
along
and
it
was
with
an
absorbed
though
courteous
air
that
he
returned
the
many
salutations
bestowed
florent
wondered
what
he
was
reflecting
upon
and
if
the
grim
unfriendliness
of
the
old
calvinist
pastor
still
troubled
him
then
as
they
reached
the
low
buildings
of
the
palace
he
snatched
his
own
thoughts
to
the
moment
he
must
have
his
wits
about
him
there
was
croix
s
letter
they
were
received
by
mynheer
van
ghent
the
prince
s
governor
in
a
fine
but
gloomy
chamber
with
a
painted
ceiling
half
the
palace
considered
now
the
property
of
the
state
was
locked
up
and
the
prince
allowed
but
the
use
of
one
wing
to
florent
the
room
had
an
air
of
mournful
splendour
built
for
a
palace
and
used
as
a
prison
there
was
a
sense
of
sombre
dreariness
over
the
whole
building
the
furniture
was
scant
and
plain
there
were
no
pictures
on
the
walls
and
the
bookcases
plain
and
austere
held
volumes
of
a
severe
look
and
character
mostly
on
mathematics
or
tactics
a
gloomy
place
for
a
young
man
to
live
in
watched
by
enemies
a
dreary
place
for
a
prince
to
be
brought
up
in
surrounded
by
cold
faces
by
suspicion
distrust
and
enmity
a
cheerless
habitation
for
the
heir
to
a
ruined
house
friendless
early
orphaned
and
forced
to
guard
his
every
word
and
look
de
witt
s
policy
might
be
that
of
conciliation
and
concession
he
might
hold
out
his
hand
sincerely
and
with
his
heart
in
it
but
it
was
not
easy
to
imagine
life
as
very
pleasant
for
the
young
prince
in
these
stern
environments
mynheer
van
ghent
talked
a
little
with
the
grand
pensionary
florent
had
heard
that
the
prince
hated
his
governor
it
was
common
knowledge
that
he
had
fallen
ill
of
chagrin
when
forced
to
part
with
his
former
tutor
his
uncle
mynheer
de
zuylestein
florent
therefore
observed
mynheer
van
ghent
closely
and
found
in
him
nothing
displeasing
but
rather
a
kind
of
melancholy
austerity
and
a
gentle
demeanour
he
stood
a
little
apart
from
him
and
his
master
and
could
not
hear
what
the
two
were
saying
their
voices
were
low
and
guarded
he
wondered
where
the
prince
was
if
he
would
see
him
if
he
would
possibly
be
able
to
convey
pomponne
s
the
heavy
door
at
the
end
of
the
room
which
was
not
far
from
him
opened
quietly
a
young
man
stepped
into
the
apartment
and
closed
the
door
after
him
florent
was
startled
taken
aback
confused
the
young
man
regarded
him
out
of
a
pair
of
remarkable
eyes
gave
him
a
slow
mournful
unsmiling
glance
and
seemed
to
hesitate
florent
was
not
sure
the
youth
was
plainly
even
shabbily
dressed
and
looked
too
grave
and
tall
for
seventeen
but
de
witt
turned
and
held
out
his
hand
i
find
your
highness
well
he
inquired
william
of
orange
crossed
the
room
i
am
very
well
he
answered
respectfully
he
bent
his
head
to
his
governor
and
to
the
grand
pensionary
will
you
come
into
the
other
room
mynheer
he
added
i
have
desired
a
fire
florent
van
mander
was
studying
him
greedily
now
cursing
himself
too
for
a
lost
chance
that
moment
when
the
prince
entered
he
could
have
slipped
the
package
into
his
very
hand
if
only
he
had
known
him
at
first
sight
he
drew
the
letter
out
of
his
pocket
watching
the
prince
the
while
de
witt
had
his
back
to
him
certainly
his
highness
was
tall
for
his
age
and
with
none
of
the
awkwardness
of
boyhood
he
was
elegant
rather
delicately
made
and
carried
himself
with
an
air
of
unnatural
almost
dangerous
quiet
and
control
despite
his
plain
dress
and
subdued
manner
he
was
not
in
the
least
insignificant
but
of
a
noticeable
and
princely
appearance
to
florent
even
at
this
first
glance
a
personality
masterful
and
attractive
the
three
came
down
the
room
towards
the
secretary
the
prince
a
little
in
advance
florent
could
note
his
face
pale
and
clear
complexioned
with
a
nose
and
curved
lips
set
firmly
wonderful
eyes
hazel
green
large
and
brilliant
under
dark
reddish
brows
and
a
low
white
forehead
shaded
with
heavy
auburn
curls
that
fell
on
to
his
linen
collar
de
witt
s
secretary
had
that
swift
impression
of
the
prince
and
as
swift
an
inspiration
he
stooped
as
if
to
pick
something
up
your
highness
dropped
this
he
said
as
the
prince
reached
him
he
held
out
his
handkerchief
concealed
in
it
the
frenchman
s
letter
william
of
orange
turned
his
head
there
was
a
look
about
his
brow
and
mouth
as
if
he
controlled
incessant
pain
but
neither
that
nor
the
expression
of
gravity
that
made
him
appear
old
for
his
years
could
destroy
the
charm
of
his
youth
his
eyes
fixed
on
florent
thank
you
mynheer
he
said
and
put
out
his
small
aristocratic
hand
florent
thrilled
as
their
fingers
touched
the
prince
slipped
the
handkerchief
into
his
pocket
and
passed
on
now
that
it
was
done
florent
marvelled
that
he
had
had
the
temerity
to
venture
it
the
prince
though
he
must
have
known
that
it
was
not
his
handkerchief
and
have
felt
at
once
the
packet
inside
the
cambric
gave
not
the
slightest
sign
of
discomposure
it
was
perfectly
done
florent
saw
in
it
the
training
of
one
brought
up
amid
spies
and
enemies
but
he
had
risked
something
in
taking
this
youth
s
prudence
so
for
granted
the
prince
did
not
look
at
the
secretary
again
but
passed
into
the
next
chamber
with
de
witt
as
he
closed
the
door
he
gave
a
sharp
glance
at
the
grand
pensionary
then
crossed
to
a
little
table
by
the
window
and
seated
himself
there
they
were
in
a
small
room
lit
by
a
fire
that
burnt
pleasantly
between
the
andirons
on
the
hearth
the
walls
were
hung
with
stamped
leather
in
one
corner
stood
a
globe
and
beside
it
a
desk
covered
with
maps
and
plans
de
witt
took
the
chair
by
the
fireplace
and
turned
so
that
he
faced
the
prince
his
sad
tender
eyes
were
fixed
with
an
almost
yearning
expression
on
the
graceful
figure
of
the
young
man
who
half
leaning
against
the
desk
sat
waiting
in
an
expressionless
quiet
attitude
the
grand
pensionary
loosened
his
heavy
cloak
we
will
have
no
lesson
highness
he
said
i
have
to
speak
of
practical
politics
and
am
here
to
talk
gravely
with
that
is
as
you
wish
mynheer
answered
william
he
had
a
voice
naturally
changeful
and
musical
but
like
his
eyes
and
his
movements
it
was
controlled
to
a
cold
expressionlessness
i
hope
that
it
will
also
be
your
wish
said
de
witt
when
i
tell
you
that
it
is
of
the
affairs
of
holland
i
desire
to
i
am
always
at
the
disposal
of
their
high
mightinesses
replied
william
with
the
slightest
inflection
of
sarcasm
john
de
witt
made
an
open
gesture
with
his
fine
right
hand
as
if
to
sweep
aside
all
formality
and
convention
it
must
not
be
like
this
between
us
highness
he
said
with
great
gentle
sweetness
of
late
you
have
met
me
somewhat
coldly
why
william
sat
up
slowly
his
eyes
were
averted
i
have
often
assured
you
mynheer
he
answered
of
my
duty
and
affection
have
their
high
mightinesses
anything
to
complain
of
again
there
was
that
faint
stress
on
the
pompous
title
de
witt
regarded
him
steadily
i
spoke
for
myself
highness
thinking
that
the
services
i
have
rendered
you
the
affection
i
have
always
felt
for
you
might
have
kept
me
some
place
in
your
still
the
prince
would
not
answer
the
appeal
in
the
words
even
by
raising
his
eyes
i
have
always
striven
he
said
to
express
my
gratitude
to
you
mynheer
for
your
constant
there
was
a
look
almost
of
wonder
on
the
noble
face
of
de
witt
as
if
he
could
hardly
credit
the
unmoved
composure
of
this
boy
i
have
not
come
highness
to
exchange
with
you
the
language
of
diplomacy
he
said
william
looked
up
now
it
is
the
only
language
i
have
had
the
chance
to
learn
john
de
witt
gazed
at
him
gently
and
sadly
i
have
never
taught
you
anything
but
frankness
highness
i
have
deserved
both
your
trust
and
your
affection
it
has
been
my
dearest
wish
my
most
cherished
hope
that
i
might
educate
you
to
become
my
friend
my
ally
in
the
government
of
the
united
the
prince
made
the
slightest
movement
and
again
averted
his
eyes
you
are
no
child
now
continued
de
witt
and
must
fairly
well
understand
your
position
and
i
understand
both
mynheer
answered
william
you
have
been
educated
as
a
citizen
of
holland
and
it
is
to
the
citizen
of
holland
that
i
have
come
to
speak
de
witt
paused
a
moment
he
was
slightly
flushed
and
his
voice
was
full
of
emotion
i
have
striven
to
make
you
worthy
of
your
grandfather
and
of
that
ancestor
of
yours
who
secured
us
our
liberty
and
it
is
my
wish
to
obtain
for
you
those
dignities
that
are
the
heritage
of
your
house
all
that
are
compatible
with
the
safety
of
this
william
still
looking
away
spoke
slowly
the
republic
has
nothing
to
fear
from
me
mynheer
i
surely
am
of
but
little
account
in
the
de
witt
was
observing
him
very
closely
you
have
the
name
highness
he
said
you
must
know
that
and
it
is
a
power
you
must
know
that
also
you
are
the
heir
of
the
family
that
once
ruled
holland
and
you
are
used
as
the
rallying
point
of
all
the
william
glanced
up
with
a
curious
intense
expression
you
speak
very
frankly
i
have
no
object
to
serve
by
dissimulation
answered
john
de
witt
i
come
to
you
i
can
claim
to
have
always
spoken
openly
to
you
highness
since
you
first
were
of
an
age
to
understand
these
he
paused
bending
his
eyes
on
the
prince
his
manner
and
speech
were
weighty
his
entire
thought
his
entire
energy
seemed
concentrated
on
what
he
said
as
if
he
the
great
and
lofty
statesman
strove
by
sheer
force
of
strength
of
character
to
overwhelm
rouse
and
conquer
the
impassive
youth
before
him
openly
i
spoke
to
you
once
before
highness
when
their
high
mightinesses
passed
the
perpetual
edict
i
told
you
that
we
abolished
the
office
of
the
stadtholder
out
of
regard
for
the
liberty
of
the
country
i
assured
you
of
my
friendship
but
i
told
you
plainly
that
we
would
risk
no
recurrence
of
the
prince
coughed
slightly
and
lowered
his
eyes
i
remember
mynheer
very
and
now
again
i
have
to
speak
of
the
safety
of
the
united
provinces
william
answered
without
moving
what
have
i
to
do
mynheer
with
the
safety
of
the
state
i
will
make
that
clear
to
you
said
john
de
witt
gravely
i
can
not
tell
how
much
you
know
of
what
this
party
does
in
your
name
i
refuse
to
believe
that
you
encourage
them
could
i
have
been
more
dutiful
to
the
state
more
quiet
than
i
have
been
interrupted
william
he
gave
no
sign
of
any
feeling
or
agitation
save
that
the
colour
of
delicate
health
had
deepened
in
his
thin
cheeks
you
have
been
too
quiet
answered
the
grand
pensionary
i
want
you
to
act
he
waited
a
second
but
the
prince
did
not
speak
i
am
greatly
troubled
continued
de
witt
with
a
stately
simplicity
by
these
men
who
strive
to
hinder
and
oppose
the
government
you
know
their
names
count
frederick
william
beverningh
zuylestein
fagel
none
of
these
are
my
friends
save
zuylestein
returned
the
prince
and
you
have
good
cause
to
know
mynheer
that
i
see
nothing
of
him
m
zuylestein
left
your
service
because
i
doubted
his
loyalty
to
the
republic
said
john
de
witt
sternly
and
now
he
works
discord
in
zeeland
and
for
the
others
whether
you
know
it
or
not
they
traffic
in
your
name
in
what
manner
mynheer
in
what
manner
they
meddle
with
france
and
england
they
sow
dissension
in
the
town
councils
in
the
assembly
itself
they
riot
in
the
street
i
think
that
you
must
know
it
every
reasonable
concession
hath
been
made
but
no
reasonable
concession
will
content
them
it
was
agreed
that
the
question
of
the
of
the
seat
in
the
council
of
state
should
be
postponed
until
you
were
of
age
they
agitate
for
these
honours
now
you
must
know
this
also
the
prince
glanced
at
him
sideways
then
looked
very
quickly
down
again
in
zeeland
where
you
are
premier
noble
your
partisans
make
the
excuse
of
your
titles
of
ter
veere
and
flushing
to
demand
your
appearance
in
their
council
now
they
consider
you
of
and
for
the
third
time
he
added
you
must
know
this
he
paused
impressively
and
his
eyes
were
dark
and
ardently
commanding
on
the
prince
william
put
his
hand
to
his
brow
as
if
he
made
a
mechanical
movement
to
ease
a
constant
pain
there
what
do
you
wish
me
to
do
he
asked
quietly
de
witt
answered
at
once
i
want
you
to
disown
this
party
they
may
act
without
your
sanction
they
can
not
act
in
face
of
your
disapproval
i
want
you
as
an
ally
as
a
friend
i
am
powerless
as
either
mynheer
returned
the
prince
and
he
suddenly
turned
his
wonderful
eyes
on
the
grand
pensionary
since
you
designate
these
you
speak
of
as
my
friends
to
what
in
me
do
you
appeal
to
act
against
them
there
was
a
flash
of
imperiousness
in
his
tone
new
to
de
witt
it
was
almost
the
manner
of
a
king
to
a
subject
it
gave
the
grand
pensionary
the
bewildered
sense
that
he
with
twenty
years
experience
of
affairs
and
the
management
of
men
was
not
equal
to
this
boy
whom
he
had
seen
grow
up
whom
he
had
himself
educated
i
appeal
to
you
as
a
citizen
of
the
republic
he
said
i
have
not
brought
you
up
to
put
yourself
before
your
country
he
hesitated
a
moment
before
continuing
i
have
always
thought
you
of
too
great
a
nature
to
prefer
the
phantom
of
personal
aggrandisement
to
the
good
of
the
commonwealth
it
seemed
as
if
on
an
impulse
william
was
about
to
speak
but
he
checked
himself
and
de
witt
went
on
will
you
let
yourself
highness
be
used
to
stir
up
faction
in
the
state
will
you
be
an
instrument
in
the
hands
of
ambitious
i
can
not
help
my
birth
mynheer
answered
the
prince
nor
prevent
the
people
from
using
my
he
had
not
lowered
his
clear
brilliant
glance
and
the
two
pairs
of
eyes
met
across
the
small
firelit
room
john
de
witt
s
met
a
fathomless
inscrutable
look
and
a
horrible
mistrust
of
this
too
composed
youth
crept
into
his
mind
a
distrust
he
had
known
before
and
always
fought
against
and
dismissed
but
william
of
orange
was
the
nephew
of
charles
of
england
and
the
cousin
of
louis
of
france
i
believe
france
meditates
the
destruction
of
the
united
provinces
de
witt
said
suddenly
colbert
envies
our
commerce
and
king
louis
is
mad
for
i
do
not
trust
the
prince
never
altering
his
easy
attitude
nor
changing
the
level
tones
of
his
voice
nor
in
any
way
taking
heed
of
the
feeling
that
surged
behind
de
witt
s
words
put
his
hand
slowly
to
his
breast
where
in
the
pocket
of
his
black
waistcoat
lay
the
letter
wrapped
in
florent
van
mander
s
handkerchief
what
has
this
to
do
with
the
object
of
your
coming
mynheer
he
asked
the
grand
pensionary
found
the
almost
unnatural
composure
and
control
of
this
boy
agitating
him
the
colour
came
into
his
face
france
might
seize
any
pretext
he
said
any
pretext
if
we
are
to
stand
we
must
be
united
william
slightly
raised
his
fine
red
brows
so
distinguished
a
statesman
as
yourself
mynheer
will
know
how
to
meet
any
misfortune
that
threatens
de
witt
regarded
him
earnestly
had
he
failed
had
the
royal
breed
been
too
powerful
for
all
his
careful
training
he
thought
he
traced
in
the
commanding
eyes
and
curved
mouth
of
the
prince
the
arrogance
the
hauteur
of
regal
blood
not
so
easy
to
quench
or
overcome
had
he
failed
many
had
foretold
he
would
had
he
undertaken
too
confidently
the
task
of
making
into
a
staunch
loyal
republican
the
heir
of
the
oldest
house
in
europe
the
son
of
a
man
who
had
risked
all
in
an
attempt
at
sovereign
power
and
of
a
woman
too
proud
to
speak
to
a
you
speak
as
if
with
hate
of
me
he
said
and
there
was
a
half
sad
confession
of
failure
in
the
words
but
for
holland
you
love
holland
william
was
leaning
against
the
side
of
his
chair
resting
his
hand
on
the
arm
of
it
both
you
and
my
country
mynheer
he
replied
have
my
duty
and
my
affection
my
position
makes
me
powerless
to
help
de
witt
gave
him
a
flashing
glance
you
can
serve
your
country
highness
by
withdrawing
from
all
association
with
these
noisy
partisans
of
yours
by
letting
it
be
known
that
you
do
not
desire
to
be
regarded
as
the
prince
of
orange
heir
to
an
extinct
office
but
as
a
citizen
of
the
united
the
prince
coughed
and
again
put
his
hand
to
his
head
the
delicate
colour
had
faded
from
his
face
he
was
pale
to
the
lips
you
best
qualify
yourself
for
the
offices
that
may
one
day
be
yours
by
quiet
study
and
severe
application
continued
de
witt
not
by
endeavouring
to
thrust
yourself
upon
the
selfish
suggestions
of
sordid
ambition
into
power
for
which
your
youth
renders
you
unfit
and
into
places
from
which
the
law
debars
william
gave
one
of
his
rare
slow
smiles
it
seemed
to
rob
the
grand
pensionary
s
speech
of
half
its
weight
and
meaning
my
docility
hath
not
deserved
this
mynheer
he
said
half
the
people
at
the
hague
would
not
know
me
if
they
saw
me
and
you
accuse
me
of
endeavouring
to
win
the
suffrage
of
the
mob
no
interrupted
de
witt
you
accuse
me
continued
william
of
selfish
i
have
not
lifted
a
finger
to
alter
my
position
i
have
always
been
the
humble
servant
of
yourself
mynheer
and
their
high
this
is
evasion
said
the
grand
pensionary
in
a
mournful
anger
i
came
to
your
highness
with
an
appeal
will
you
work
with
me
or
no
i
am
always
at
your
service
answered
the
prince
it
seemed
that
in
no
way
could
de
witt
break
through
this
even
immovable
courtesy
his
anger
began
to
rise
against
a
nature
that
could
turn
to
him
this
hard
reserve
he
recalled
his
patient
services
his
honest
attempt
to
win
the
prince
his
frankness
towards
the
orange
party
his
loyal
endeavour
that
his
young
ward
should
not
suffer
for
the
misfortune
of
his
house
his
eagerness
to
establish
a
friendship
with
the
prince
so
that
one
day
they
might
work
together
for
the
good
of
the
land
now
it
would
seem
all
this
had
largely
been
in
vain
the
first
time
he
put
it
to
the
issue
he
found
that
he
dealt
with
intractable
unyielding
perhaps
treacherous
material
treacherous
that
stinging
thought
not
to
be
banished
roused
him
almost
unbearably
you
shut
me
out
of
your
confidence
highness
he
said
you
will
neither
trust
me
nor
be
frank
with
i
do
not
know
what
policy
you
pursue
nor
whose
advice
you
follow
in
refusing
to
treat
me
as
what
i
have
ever
endeavoured
to
be

i
do
not

your
counsellors
but
i
think
they
advise

john
de
witt
rose
the
firelight
cast
the
leaping
shadow
of
his
tall
stately
figure
upon
the
wall
behind
him
i
have
been
very
patient
his
voice
was
strong
full
of
emotion
but
i
have
the
dignity
of
the
republic
to
consider
and
if
i
thought
he
caught
himself
up
the
prince
raised
his
eyes
and
their
expression
goaded
de
witt
what
did
buat
die
for
he
asked
william
answered
calmly
for
selling
the
secrets
of
holland
to
for
betraying
his
country
highness
and
he
was
of
the
orange
party
madame
buat
is
one
of
their
most
active
agents
now
but
i
have
had
enough
of
it
if
you
dare
the
prince
sprang
lightly
to
his
feet
if
you
dare
highness
repeated
de
witt
sternly
the
republic
will
know
how
to
mynheer
de
witt
said
william
in
a
stifled
voice
what
do
you
mean
have
you
dealings
with
your
uncle
charles
stewart
are
you
secretly
tampering
with
the
agents
of
france
demanded
the
grand
pensionary
there
is
my
he
paused
the
prince
did
not
alter
the
hard
quiet
of
his
manner
though
his
great
eyes
showed
a
tumult
of
feeling
what
right
have
you
to
ask
that
of
me
he
demanded
the
words
were
a
challenge
as
such
de
witt
answered
them
your
father
sought
foreign
aid
when
he
attempted
the
liberties
of
holland
like
a
sword
swiftly
unsheathed
the
prince
s
passion
slipped
his
control
i
will
not
hear
of
my
father
from
you
mynheer
he
cried
for
what
he
did
i
have
paid
and
for
your
insults
his
words
were
checked
in
a
fit
of
coughing
that
shook
his
frail
frame
he
had
to
support
himself
against
the
back
of
the
chair
this
evidence
of
the
ill
health
that
decided
many
doctors
in
declaring
he
could
not
live
long
instantly
softened
the
noble
heart
of
john
de
witt
touched
also
by
the
prince
s
quick
anger
forgive
me
he
said
i
had
no
right
i
ask
your
pardon
william
sank
into
his
chair
pulled
out
his
handkerchief
and
pressed
it
to
his
lips
he
still
coughed
a
little
forgive
he
answered
quiet
again
but
breathing
with
difficulty
i
forgot
i
have
taken
so
much
he
added
i
might
well
have
taken
that
but
it
is
not
often
mynheer
that
i
fail
to
recognise
your
position
and
the
words
hurt
de
witt
i
would
not
be
your
master
but
your
friend
he
said
eagerly
trust
me
and
i
will
do
more
for
you
than
these
william
looked
round
his
face
was
colourless
and
he
held
himself
as
if
exhausted
mynheer
he
said
speaking
with
something
of
an
effort
i
do
not
know
why
you
think
i
am
occupied
in
stirring
up
sedition
in
the
state
you
know
how
i
spend
every
moment
of
my
time
i
have
no
opportunity
nor
desire
i
am
your
very
good
friend
and
the
servant
of
their
noble
i
have
obviously
no
influence
with
the
party
that
you
speak
of
as
for
my
uncle
and
my
cousin
of
france
they
do
not
make
me
their
confidant
not
counting
me
doubtless
of
sufficient
john
de
witt
looked
him
in
the
eyes
with
a
deep
questioning
glance
have
i
satisfied
you
mynheer
asked
the
prince
courteously
the
grand
pensionary
could
press
no
further
he
was
half
baffled
half
angered
yet
he
found
himself
remembering
that
this
prince
who
was
behaving
so
like
a
veteran
diplomat
was
in
fact
only
a
boy
often
ill
and
lonely
i
came
with
no
suspicions
he
said
only
to
put
before
you
highness
something
of
the
state
of
the
republic
and
to
ask
your
help
if
i
can
ever
be
of
service
i
shall
be
glad
answered
william
he
looked
up
and
added
abruptly
mynheer
de
witt
might
mynheer
cornelius
triglandt
come
back
i
would
rather
have
him
for
my
chaplain
than
any
man
i
de
witt
was
taken
by
surprise
but
he
had
his
reply
ready
m
triglandt
was
removed
from
your
person
for
the
same
reason
as
zuylestein
he
said
gently
he
hath
an
unruly
tongue
and
a
heart
disloyal
to
the
republic
their
high
mightinesses
could
not
allow
his
return
if
you
esteemed
him
i
am
william
was
silent
the
grand
pensionary
glanced
at
the
bronze
clock
on
the
mantelshelf
i
have
outstayed
my
time
i
am
due
highness
at
the
the
prince
rose
next
time
continued
de
witt
i
will
examine
you
in
your
studies
till
then
i
commend
what
i
have
said
to
your
think
of
them
always
highness
as
the
words
of
a
sincere
i
am
grateful
the
grand
pensionary
went
to
the
door
and
there
hesitated
believe
me
he
said
looking
back
in
the
matter
of
mynheer
triglandt
i
would
gladly
pleasure
you
it
is
the
will
of
the
william
bent
his
head
john
de
witt
opened
the
door
in
silence
and
was
gone
the
prince
remained
by
the
table
a
long
breath
escaped
him
and
a
bright
look
shone
under
his
heavy
lids
he
cried
to
himself
in
the
words
used
by
the
great
philip
to
his
ancestor
not
the
states
but
you
you
then
he
sank
into
the
chair
again
resting
his
elbow
on
the
table
and
his
head
in
his
hand
while
he
drew
from
his
pocket
the
letter
given
him
by
florent
van
mander
he
looked
at
the
writing
and
the
seals
then
replaced
it
in
his
waistcoat
he
coughed
slightly
and
glanced
towards
the
door
which
had
closed
on
the
grand
pensionary
not
the
states
he
repeated
but
you
mynheer

witt

chapter
iv
de
witt
s
secretary
florent
van
mander
sat
at
his
desk
by
the
open
window
and
looked
out
on
to
the
garden
of
de
witt
the
mysterious
damp
and
misty
days
of
autumn
had
set
in
thin
sea
vapours
blew
from
morning
till
night
across
the
hague
the
sunshine
was
faint
as
if
it
came
from
a
great
distance
no
fire
burnt
in
the
library
but
the
secretary
had
quietly
set
the
window
open
heedless
of
the
chilly
air
for
de
witt
was
walking
in
the
garden
talking
to
his
brother
cornelius
de
witt
ruard
of
putten
who
had
come
up
from
dordt
and
florent
was
listening
to
their
conversation
as
it
came
clearly
through
the
tranquil
stillness
if
you
do
not
send
more
troops
brother
the
ruard
was
saying
i
think
zeeland
will
get
beyond
all
management
count
tilly
would
be
the
man
to
quiet
i
can
not
spare
tilly
from
the
hague
answered
the
softer
voice
of
the
grand
pensionary
and
i
have
written
to
the
burgomaster
of
you
hold
the
reins
too
gently
returned
cornelius
de
witt
i
think
the
prince
is
in
touch
with
these
agitators
in
zeeland
it
is
hardly
possible
he
is
kept
too
you
should
keep
him
closer
are
you
sure
of
those
about
him
they
are
of
mine
own
choice
even
to
his
well
said
the
ruard
grimly
he
may
have
corrupted
florent
leant
forward
cautiously
the
brothers
had
halted
close
to
the
window
the
grand
pensionary
s
back
was
towards
him
but
he
could
see
the
fine
rugged
face
of
the
ruard
frowning
now
and
shaded
by
the
great
black
beaver
he
wore
i
have
his
assurance
of
loyalty
said
john
de
witt
i
do
not
think
he
is
of
a
nature
to
be
false
he
is
quiet
take
care
he
be
not
as
cunning
as
he
is
i
have
no
right
to
think
it
answered
the
grand
pensionary
there
was
impatience
in
his
brother
s
reply
you
have
always
been
just
the
time
has
gone
past
for
they
moved
on
slowly
van
mander
could
hear
their
footsteps
on
the
gravel
but
not
what
they
said
he
had
had
his
dismissal
for
the
day
probably
de
witt
thought
he
had
already
gone
he
locked
his
desk
and
put
on
his
hat
and
cloak
then
softly
shut
the
window
before
he
left
the
building
he
went
upstairs
to
de
witt
s
private
cabinet
to
return
some
papers
he
had
copied
for
van
den
bosch
the
head
secretary
who
in
company
with
the
two
confidential
clerks
bacherus
and
van
ouvenaller
always
sat
there
van
mander
returned
to
the
hall
with
a
dislike
of
these
busy
quiet
dry
men
so
intent
on
serving
their
master
machines
he
called
them
what
could
they
ever
hope
to
rise
to
and
they
had
all
the
secrets
of
de
witt
in
their
hands
there
would
be
a
game
worth
playing
supposing
that
possessed
the
keys
of
those
desks
but
they
never
entrusted
him
with
anything
of
importance
save
yesterday
when
he
had
carried
the
red
velvet
bag
his
mind
leapt
back
to
the
letter
he
had
given
the
prince
he
stepped
out
of
john
de
witt
s
pink
brick
house
into
the
that
was
increasing
as
the
sun
set
and
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
nieuwe
kerk
which
lay
towards
the
gates
the
vapour
rested
lightly
on
the
water
of
the
vyver
and
clung
to
the
yellowing
chestnut
trees
that
surrounded
it
beyond
rose
the
straight
walls
of
the
binnenhof
dimly
seen
looming
darkly
from
the
mist
florent
crossed
the
empty
plaats
before
him
the
threatening
lines
of
the
blunt
roof
of
the
gevangenpoort
the
prison
gate
seemed
to
spring
from
out
the
fast
thickening
fog
as
if
they
were
shaped
from
dark
clouds
and
had
no
foundation
on
the
earth
one
barred
window
showed
in
the
gloomy
structure
and
above
it
the
flag
of
the
republic
glimpsed
through
the
obscurity
florent
passed
under
the
low
deep
arch
and
came
out
into
the
buitenhof
the
soldiers
on
duty
here
the
few
seemed
unreal
and
remote
so
wrapped
about
and
mysterious
were
they
rendered
by
the
damp
encroaching
mist
florent
was
impressed
subdued
by
the
silent
personality
of
the
town
wearing
the
like
a
veil
over
her
ancient
glories
like
a
veil
of
mourning
maybe
for
her
coming
downfall
all
the
splendour
of
the
seven
provinces
all
their
strength
their
endurance
their
simplicity
their
heroism
were
symbolised
in
these
buildings
rising
staunch
and
heavy
through
the
sad
dripping
fog
the
gables
and
turrets
of
the
hall
of
the
knights
the
tourelles
and
pale
brick
of
the
binnenhof
with
the
bright
painted
shutters
faintly
showing
and
here
and
there
a
light
gleaming
at
a
window
and
above
all
the
great
tower
of
the
groote
kerk
rising
through
the
fog
that
the
sea
ever
beating
on
the
shores
and
dykes
of
holland
with
a
persistent
and
sinister
purpose
sends
rolling
drearily
over
the
land
it
can
not
yet
reclaim
florent
traversed
the
courts
of
the
binnenhof
and
entered
the
spuistraat
where
the
and
the
lights
in
the
shops
cast
faint
haloes
on
the
mist
here
he
followed
the
canal
that
led
to
the
nieuwe
kerk
crossing
the
bridge
under
which
slow
barges
passed
winding
along
the
grey
water
through
the
grey
land
towards
ryswysk
he
circled
the
clumsy
grim
church
and
discovered
behind
it
at
the
corner
of
bezemstraat
the
nieuwe
doelen
there
in
the
quiet
plain
back
parlour
of
the
inn
he
found
hyacinthe
croix
florent
greeted
him
with
his
habitual
brevity
and
went
to
the
fire
he
was
chilled
his
garments
damp
even
here
the
mist
had
penetrated
and
filled
the
room
with
a
salt
sense
of
wet
and
cold
croix
ordered
dinner
and
leaning
back
surveyed
his
company
florent
looked
up
suddenly
the
firelight
stained
his
linen
collar
his
pale
face
to
ruddiness
i
delivered
your
the
frenchman
answered
not
allowing
himself
to
show
any
satisfaction
i
thought
you
florent
was
silent
a
while
rubbing
his
hands
together
over
the
blaze
how
do
you
hope
to
receive
an
answer
he
said
at
last
if
the
prince
wishes
to
send
one
he
will
contrive
florent
started
at
that
we
are
quite
safe
here
remarked
croix
easily
this
is
le
marquis
ah
florent
glanced
round
the
small
neat
room
with
the
herbs
hanging
from
the
beams
the
pottery
the
shining
brass
an
inn
room
like
a
hundred
others
m
le
marquis
does
it
very
well
he
said
naturally
smiled
croix
what
was
your
opinion
of
the
prince
he
added
florent
ignored
the
question
i
was
wondering
he
said
slowly
how
the
prince
could
communicate
with
any
one
he
is
kept
marvellously
croix
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
said
he
would
contrive
i
think
he
is
as
clever
as
de
florent
reflected
on
the
words
he
had
heard
the
grand
pensionary
use
that
evening
to
his
brother
those
about
him
are
all
of
de
witt
s
choosing
he
said
the
prince
might
win
some
one
of
florent
looked
up
quickly
do
you
imagine
him
the
sort
of
man
to
win
devotion
i
do
not
know
what
is
your
opinion
florent
smiled
rather
sourly
i
suppose
some
would
serve
him
from
policy
because
they
saw
a
restoration
he
answered
but
he
is
greatly
beloved
in
he
has
done
nothing
to
win
the
suffrage
of
the
no
said
florent
he
has
done
it
is
the
name
resumed
croix
lightly
and
the
prestige
of
the
house
of
supper
was
brought
in
and
more
candles
florent
crossed
to
the
window
outside
the
mist
was
rolling
past
like
waves
white
and
curling
the
sound
of
the
struggling
large
poles
could
be
heard
through
it
the
noise
of
the
wet
mast
striking
the
wet
deck
as
it
was
lowered
to
pass
under
the
bridge
and
the
men
s
voices
shouting
to
each
other
hoarse
remote
florent
glanced
askance
over
his
shoulder
at
croix
a
man
who
was
despising
him
no
doubt
as
one
of
a
fallen
race
anticipating
the
time
when
the
king
of
france
would
be
master
of
holland
the
dictator
of
europe
he
began
to
find
that
he
hated
croix
and
that
he
was
angry
with
himself
for
being
there
playing
into
the
frenchman
s
hands
he
thought
of
the
quiet
worn
men
in
de
witt
s
cabinet
whom
he
had
at
the
moment
so
despised
now
he
was
ready
to
wish
his
hands
as
clean
as
theirs
he
resented
the
look
of
insolent
superiority
he
thought
to
read
in
the
powdered
face
of
hyacinthe
croix
but
the
frenchman
spoke
pleasantly
will
you
not
come
to
dinner
florent
silently
complied
he
found
that
the
little
inn
supported
by
the
pay
of
le
marquis
de
pomponne
provided
of
the
best
food
and
wine
were
both
better
than
he
was
accustomed
to
this
further
set
him
against
croix
who
was
buying
him
in
this
paltry
way
as
surely
as
was
william
of
orange
being
bought
by
the
power
and
wealth
of
france
and
england
what
was
in
that
letter
i
delivered
he
demanded
suddenly
hyacinthe
croix
gave
answer
with
a
fine
appearance
of
frankness
you
have
heard
of
the
feeling
in
zeeland
his
highness
is
its
premier
noble
and
now
that
he
is
in
his
eighteenth
year
the
people
consider
him
of
age
and
desire
him
to
take
his
seat
in
the
council
there
m
de
witt
would
never
allow
mon
dieu
no
de
witt
would
never
allow
it
but
it
is
possible
that
monseigneur
the
prince
might
act
without
ah
said
florent
he
leant
back
his
hand
round
his
wineglass
his
eyes
fixed
across
the
candles
shine
on
the
frenchman
s
face
and
le
marquis
would
help
him
in
this
making
of
it
a
challenge
the
glove
thrown
down
assented
hyacinthe
croix
it
would
be
a
bold
move
for
his
highness
to
make
if
he
once
outwits
de
witt
he
opens
his
eyes
for
always
and
there
can
be
no
more
confidence
between
them
yet
maybe
he
would
hazard
it
under
the
protection
of
france
interrupted
florent
you
wonder
we
think
it
worth
while
returned
croix
quickly
but
there
are
many
this
young
man
is
his
majesty
s
cousin
and
de
louvois
sees
how
good
use
may
be
made
of
him
he
is
already
of
some
influence
in
the
state
and
his
party
m
de
pomponne
is
ready
to
help
him
to
raise
revolt
in
middelburg
is
temple
in
this
asked
florent
abruptly
croix
smiled
he
is
like
de
witt
hopelessly
florent
emptied
his
glass
slowly
we
have
made
overtures
to
the
princess
of
orange
but
she
is
old
and
cautious
continued
croix
also
to
de
zuylestein
and
prince
john
maurice
the
letter
you
passed
to
monseigneur
the
prince
contained
an
offer
on
the
part
of
le
marquis
to
connive
at
his
escape
to
how
could
it
be
done
mused
florent
m
le
marquis
could
accomplish
it
van
ghent
is
away
florent
looked
up
sharply
yes
he
left
on
a
visit
to
his
estate
in
guelders
the
prince
hath
then
thrown
in
his
lot
with
you
he
added
put
himself
under
the
protection
of
france
mon
dieu
what
else
is
there
for
him
to
do
florent
pushed
back
his
chair
he
had
eaten
very
little
nor
did
croix
press
it
though
he
had
dined
well
himself
after
an
indifferent
easy
fashion
that
nettled
his
guest
ugh
this
mist
of
yours
shivered
the
frenchman
suddenly
glancing
about
the
room
nothing
will
keep
it
out
how
much
of
it
do
you
have
i
am
new
to
the
hague
but
there
is
plenty
of
it
until
we
get
the
frosts
then
too
croix
made
a
wry
face
i
would
the
holy
virgin
had
placed
my
talents
elsewhere
here
there
is
nothing
wherewith
to
amuse
one
s
self
save
the
contemplation
of
dutch
virtue
and
the
effort
to
avoid
rheumatism
how
do
you
endure
it
my
friend
by
being
dutch
answered
florent
gazing
at
him
steadily
you
speak
very
plainly
to
me
i
am
croix
laughed
you
think
me
overbold
but
i
tell
you
this
my
master
is
more
powerful
in
the
seven
provinces
than
any
dutchman
as
you
are
ambitious
you
had
best
not
offend
so
they
threatened
they
felt
themselves
strong
enough
for
that
i
have
my
own
interests
at
heart
commented
florent
dryly
after
a
pause
i
see
that
the
orange
party
is
the
one
to
i
shall
serve
it
knowing
quite
well
croix
that
it
is
another
name
for
the
frenchman
blinked
his
fair
eyes
his
highness
may
be
called
the
lever
with
which
his
majesty
will
heave
the
united
provinces
on
to
the
map
of
france
he
remarked
you
seem
very
sure
of
him
said
florent
and
i
believe
that
you
are
right
but
it
is
curious
in
all
the
discussions
concerning
this
prince
whose
name
we
all
use
alike
to
serve
our
ends
among
all
the
factions
that
clamour
for
william
of
orange
is
there
never
one
to
think
of
him
as
other
than
the
tool
of
france
does
it
never
enter
the
thoughts
of
any
that
he
might
prove
as
honest
as
de
witt
as
faithful
to
his
country
this
is
not
an
age
of
heroes
smiled
croix
and
added
half
insolently
do
you
regret
the
fact
monsieur
m
de
witt
is
a
m
de
witt
is
a
saint
and
a
fool
replied
the
frenchman
and
the
prince
of
orange
is
some
must
believe
in
as
an
instrument
to
gratify
their
ambition
beverningh
de
zuylestein
and
prince
john
maurice
believe
in
him
certainly
after
that
i
do
not
mean
them
but
these
people
in
the
street
jacob
van
der
graef
a
silly
young
man
remarked
croix
lighting
his
pipe
yes
perhaps
those
people
do
believe
in
the
glory
of
the
old
dynasty
but
things
have
changed
since
the
days
of
william
the
taciturn
as
i
say
there
are
no
heroes
florent
suddenly
shrugged
his
shoulders
these
are
foolish
matters
for
us
to
be
discussing
you
know
where
my
interests
lie
monsieur
and
he
added
with
a
strange
note
of
defiance
you
have
pointed
out
that
safety
also
rests
with
my
silence
you
need
not
fear
that
i
should
betray
you
to
de
witt
or
be
over
faithful
to
him
i
at
least
am
not
a
i
think
you
are
shrewd
enough
answered
croix
and
i
have
trusted
you
with
a
delicate
matter
the
way
to
your
fortune
is
plain
for
the
present
stay
where
you
are
keep
quiet
and
docile
to
de
florent
smiled
he
is
not
difficult
to
fool
he
said
grimly
de
no
assented
croix
lazily
watching
his
rings
of
smoke
but
he
is
difficult
to
lie
florent
was
silent
a
dusky
colour
flushed
into
his
cheeks
m
le
marquis
continued
the
frenchman
hath
told
me
that
he
finds
the
grand
pensionary
more
troublesome
to
deal
with
than
any
clever
yet
he
is
simple
credulous
said
florent
see
in
this
matter
of
the
prince
how
he
trusts
he
hath
his
own
wisdom
answered
croix
but
his
day
is
he
looked
shrewdly
at
the
young
secretary
and
added
i
must
bring
you
to
speech
of
le
florent
made
no
answer
he
rose
you
are
going
asked
croix
leaning
indolently
on
the
table
i
have
some
work
to
do
de
witt
must
not
find
me
it
was
not
the
truth
the
secretary
s
duties
ended
when
he
quitted
the
grand
pensionary
s
house
but
croix
accepted
the
excuse
you
will
hear
from
me
again
in
a
day
or
so
he
said
the
lodgings
in
the
kerkestraat
will
always
find
you
florent
picked
up
his
hat
and
cloak
from
the
bench
that
ran
round
the
wall
and
turned
to
leave
i
shall
keep
my
eyes
and
ears
alert
he
said
nodded
croix
a
sullen
brute
he
thought
as
the
door
closed
on
florent
but
these
dutchmen
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
one
must
use
them
as
one
finds
florent
van
mander
cared
nothing
what
impression
he
had
made
his
one
desire
was
to
get
away
to
be
alone
he
welcomed
the
cold
white
fog
after
the
brightly
lit
parlour
and
the
intolerable
frenchman
sitting
there
over
his
wine
he
hated
it
and
all
it
symbolised
hated
it
so
suddenly
and
so
bitterly
that
he
could
not
have
stayed
a
second
longer
in
the
company
of
the
man
whom
for
his
own
ends
he
was
serving
such
emotions
were
quite
new
to
him
he
could
not
understand
them
he
had
always
despised
people
who
allowed
sentiment
to
interfere
with
ambition
one
could
not
be
great
by
following
a
falling
what
should
it
matter
to
him
a
diplomat
whether
he
was
paid
by
england
or
france
or
holland
so
he
achieved
his
aim
fortune
was
not
attained
by
sitting
in
de
witt
s
cabinet
like
van
den
bosch
and
the
grand
pensionary
had
not
inspired
florent
with
any
great
enthusiasm
or
admiration
he
had
judged
him
coldly
seen
failure
ahead
of
him
and
decided
not
to
entangle
his
fortunes
with
the
republican
government
but
nevertheless
he
felt
this
strange
wrath
and
distaste
against
himself
and
what
he
did
it
was
as
if
something
had
suddenly
touched
and
aroused
feelings
that
lay
so
deep
he
did
not
know
till
now
that
he
possessed
them
the
seven
provinces
an
appanage
of
france
they
who
had
been
the
richest
nation
in
europe
florent
checked
his
thoughts
wondering
what
had
put
into
his
mind
this
folly
almost
he
imagined
that
the
brief
moment
in
which
he
had
looked
into
the
eyes
of
william
of
orange
had
awakened
him
to
this
uneasy
questioning
yet
that
made
double
folly
since
the
prince
himself
was
but
the
tool
of
france
intriguing
with
de
pomponne
truckling
to
he
had
walked
through
the
mist
along
the
spuistraat
with
no
thought
of
his
destination
but
when
he
reached
the
binnenhof
he
pulled
himself
up
and
stopped
the
lamps
showing
at
intervals
on
their
red
posts
displayed
the
fog
in
great
pale
circles
but
their
light
did
not
penetrate
far
and
florent
realised
that
he
began
to
take
note
of
what
he
was
doing
in
a
thick
hurrying
darkness
of
vapour
no
moon
could
pierce
the
canal
had
ceased
and
he
knew
that
he
must
be
by
the
binnenhof
no
one
seemed
abroad
the
fog
gave
the
effect
of
complete
isolation
keeping
close
to
the
stone
wall
of
the
building
he
made
his
way
through
the
black
arch
of
the
gevangenpoort
on
to
the
plaats
here
the
street
lights
revealed
the
railings
encircling
the
vyver
florent
followed
them
a
little
way
then
gathering
his
cloak
closely
round
him
paused
and
looked
down
on
to
the
water
an
abyss
of
fathomless
darkness
which
where
the
feeble
rays
of
the
lamp
struck
it
revealed
billows
of
curling
mist
which
seemed
to
be
sucked
down
into
measureless
depths
of
obscurity
florent
leant
against
the
railing
as
completely
shut
away
from
the
world
as
if
in
a
secret
chamber
all
ordinary
sights
and
sounds
had
receded
vanished
he
could
not
even
discern
the
lights
in
the
binnenhof
or
maritshuis
his
hair
was
wet
his
hat
limp
with
damp
beads
of
moisture
clung
to
his
heavy
frieze
cloak
he
could
feel
the
water
trickling
under
his
collar
and
there
was
a
salt
taste
on
his
lips
he
stood
quite
still
watching
the
twisting
striving
thickness
of
vapour
disclosed
by
the
beams
of
the
lamp
then
suddenly
a
light
was
flashed
over
him
and
a
voice
conveying
a
slightly
foreign
accent
spoke
in
a
low
tone
close
beside
him
are
you
mynheer
van
mander
clerk
to
de
witt
florent
lifted
eyes
startled
from
absorbed
contemplation
he
saw
through
the
curtain
of
the
filmy
mist
the
figure
of
a
man
wearing
like
himself
a
heavy
mantle
and
carrying
a
lantern
i
am
sure
that
you
are
the
speaker
continued
i
have
been
following
you
a
considerable
for
what
purpose
asked
florent
the
stranger
who
had
loomed
up
so
quietly
out
of
the
fog
came
a
little
nearer
you
were
at
the
palace
yesterday
florent
turned
to
face
him
the
other
raised
his
lantern
i
am
bromley
he
said
simply
matthew
bromley
the
prince
s
gentleman
and
i
have
come
to
give
you
the
answer
to
the
letter
that
you
delivered
to
his
florent
bent
his
brows
on
him
as
far
as
he
could
see
anything
he
saw
a
tall
man
with
a
fair
handsome
face
showing
under
the
hat
will
you
hand
this
to
the
person
who
entrusted
you
to
deliver
that
letter
florent
took
the
packet
held
out
to
him
if
his
highness
has
servants
as
devoted
as
you
appear
mynheer
he
said
you
might
have
conveyed
the
letter
in
the
first
and
he
remembered
how
croix
had
lamented
that
he
had
now
no
ally
in
the
prince
s
household
the
paper
is
unsealed
answered
matthew
bromley
and
i
think
it
is
his
highness
wish
that
you
read
read
it
echoed
florent
the
mist
seemed
to
be
lifting
blowing
in
long
trails
rapidly
to
extinction
the
prince
s
gentleman
hung
his
lantern
on
the
fence
you
can
read
it
here
and
now
he
said
florent
glanced
up
from
the
still
folded
paper
you
are
english
yes
i
am
english
answered
bromley
florent
gazed
at
him
keenly
you
know
something
of
the
prince
s
affairs
do
you
know
why
he
wishes
to
make
a
confidant
of
me
why
i
am
to
read
this
their
voices
were
low
and
guarded
between
them
hurried
the
long
veils
of
fog
blurring
the
and
the
light
of
the
lantern
in
which
their
figures
loomed
indistinctly
you
were
aware
what
de
pomponne
s
message
contained
therefore
the
prince
wishes
you
to
know
his
the
lights
in
the
binnenhof
in
the
maritshuis
began
to
be
visible
sparks
of
yellow
showed
too
in
the
windows
of
the
houses
in
the
kneuterdyk
avenue
a
cold
wind
was
rising
florent
shivered
with
chilled
damp
fingers
he
took
the
paper
from
its
cover
and
bending
towards
the
light
looked
at
it
the
signature
caught
his
eye
first
this
is
de
pomponne
s
letter
he
cried
it
is
also
the
prince
s
answer
returned
bromley
you
may
show
it
to
de
witt
if
you
a
swift
excitement
shook
florent
then
what
dealings
has
he
the
prince
with
france
you
may
imagine
he
returns
de
pomponne
s
he
is
subservient
to
de
witt
he
will
not
go
to
middelburg
he
will
do
nothing
under
the
protection
of
de
the
gentle
radiance
of
a
young
moon
conquered
the
vanishing
mist
florent
saw
the
shapes
of
the
trees
on
the
vyverberg
the
outlines
of
the
binnenhof
and
the
tourelles
of
the
gevangenpoort
rising
against
a
clear
sky
this
is
a
rebuke
to
me
he
said
you
may
take
it
so
replied
bromley
i
am
not
in
the
pay
of
the
french
said
florent
instantly
aware
this
man
could
ruin
him
with
his
master
though
i
suppose
the
prince
thinks
so
i
work
for
my
own
ends
serving
no
party
he
added
defiantly
the
prince
has
not
thought
of
you
at
all
mynheer
save
to
desire
you
to
know
he
hath
no
secret
dealings
with
de
pomponne
you
will
return
that
letter
yes
said
florent
concealing
it
he
thought
grimly
that
he
had
no
choice
then
bromley
saluted
gravely
took
his
now
useless
lantern
from
the
fence
and
extinguished
it
florent
s
pulses
were
beating
quickly
he
was
bewildered
confounded
there
were
many
things
he
longed
to
ask
the
prince
s
gentleman
and
not
one
that
he
could
bring
over
his
tongue
he
stood
foolishly
watching
bromley
disappear
through
the
arch
of
the
gevangenpoort
what
game
was
the
prince
playing
was
this
a
pose
to
deceive
him
the
secretary
of
de
witt
or
did
william
really
prefer
the
grand
pensionary
for
a
master
rather
than
france
or
perhaps
he
is
merely
timid
reflected
florent
crushing
scornfully
down
the
rush
of
pride
and
unreasonable
exaltation
he
had
sustained
at
the
wild
idea
that
the
prince
was
actually
spurning
de
pomponne
he
stared
at
the
dark
tranquil
waters
of
the
vyver
revealed
now
in
the
faint
moonshine
a
boy
he
sneered
to
himself
would
he
possess
the
wit
and
courage
to
undertake
unaided
this
flight
to
middelburg
no
he
had
always
shown
caution
he
would
remain
under
the
wing
of
de
witt
yet
florent
found
himself
pondering
over
the
devotion
of
matthew
bromley
to
his
master
bromley
also
had
once
been
de
witt
s
man
chapter
v
the
challenge
a
bar
of
sunshine
fell
across
the
quiet
room
in
the
binnenhof
but
it
did
not
touch
john
de
witt
from
head
to
foot
he
was
in
shadow
the
french
ambassador
had
just
left
him
a
duel
of
words
an
exchange
of
courtesies
through
the
formalities
one
sentence
of
de
pomponne
had
leapt
if
the
prince
of
orange
gave
the
signal
for
a
restoration
what
would
rise
to
answer
it
he
will
never
give
that
signal
de
witt
had
answered
and
he
believed
it
yet
strange
it
was
for
him
first
minister
of
a
republic
almost
his
creation
to
reflect
upon
this
fact
the
people
of
that
republic
clamoured
for
the
heir
of
the
house
that
had
threatened
to
set
its
heel
on
them
he
moved
half
restlessly
in
his
chair
if
william
were
indeed
working
secretly
to
undermine
him
he
might
find
his
labour
of
twenty
years
gone
for
nothing
and
live
yet
to
see
his
country
under
foreign
dominion
he
rose
and
went
to
the
window
the
hall
of
the
knights
showed
its
painted
and
pointed
shutters
against
a
faint
blue
sky
the
trees
in
the
courtyard
of
the
binnenhof
were
shedding
their
leaves
caught
by
the
wind
and
whirled
in
eddies
that
rose
a
little
way
then
sank
again
to
the
ground
the
sunlight
fell
now
directly
on
the
face
of
john
de
witt
it
revealed
how
grey
he
was
growing
round
the
temples
how
weary
and
lined
were
his
eyes
he
was
still
standing
by
the
window
when
a
tall
soldier
entered
ah
de
montbas
the
grand
pensionary
turned
i
desired
to
see
you
about
these
riots
in
zeeland
and
you
wished
me
to
go
there
mynheer
i
think
your
letter
the
speaker
was
a
sallow
sickly
looking
man
with
lank
hair
and
dark
unhappy
eyes
to
groningen
de
witt
returned
to
his
seat
in
the
shadow
i
fear
that
we
have
been
too
lenient
he
continued
the
government
must
make
some
show
of
that
is
only
wise
answered
the
count
de
montbas
and
should
mynheer
have
been
done
it
has
never
been
my
policy
to
use
force
where
persuasion
might
prevail
said
de
witt
when
one
is
adamant
in
great
things
one
may
be
careless
in
little
these
rioters
are
mostly
ignorant
people
they
are
encouraged
by
the
prince
of
orange
put
in
de
montbas
quickly
there
i
think
you
are
wrong
returned
the
grand
pensionary
quietly
he
knew
that
ill
feeling
existed
between
the
house
of
orange
and
de
montbas
whose
father
an
exiled
frenchman
had
offered
his
services
to
the
late
stadtholder
only
to
have
them
refused
de
montbas
gave
a
laugh
you
are
too
confident
the
grand
pensionary
ignored
the
remark
and
touched
a
bell
upon
his
table
i
will
read
you
the
report
of
the
disturbances
in
zeeland
and
goeree
he
said
it
was
florent
van
mander
who
entered
with
the
papers
de
witt
bade
him
stay
and
he
went
quietly
to
the
back
of
the
room
and
waited
observing
with
cruel
precision
the
two
men
before
him
he
had
heard
a
good
deal
of
de
montbas
one
of
the
staunchest
republicans
in
the
army
of
the
united
provinces
and
the
man
whom
the
grand
pensionary
always
put
forward
in
opposition
to
the
prince
of
orange
as
candidate
for
the
post
of
captain
general
a
position
that
he
now
at
least
nominally
held
florent
saw
a
dark
man
stooping
in
the
shoulders
and
awkward
in
bearing
yet
with
a
certain
elegance
of
manner
a
man
who
talked
in
a
nervous
and
disjointed
fashion
and
fidgeted
with
the
tassels
on
his
military
gloves
his
uniform
with
the
embroidered
baldric
and
heavy
sword
sat
badly
on
him
florent
found
him
neither
attractive
nor
calculated
to
inspire
confidence
and
wondered
at
the
grand
pensionary
s
choice
of
a
general
glancing
away
he
studied
de
witt
himself
behind
the
desk
where
the
grand
pensionary
sat
hung
a
dark
yet
bright
picture
of
fruit
and
flowers
and
against
this
the
brown
hair
and
pale
face
of
john
de
witt
were
thrown
into
relief
pale
certainly
even
above
his
white
falling
collar
and
black
dress
but
of
a
strength
not
to
be
mistaken
and
a
power
not
to
be
ignored
florent
listened
to
the
conversation
between
these
two
with
an
expressionless
face
but
inward
interest
for
they
had
begun
to
discuss
the
prince
of
orange
he
is
not
at
the
hague
de
witt
was
saying
m
van
ghent
is
in
guelders
and
his
highness
wrote
to
me
requesting
permission
to
try
some
hawks
and
hounds
sent
him
by
the
king
of
england
for
that
purpose
he
hath
gone
to
what
quarry
does
he
hunt
at
breda
asked
de
montbas
and
it
seemed
to
florent
that
he
spoke
like
a
man
afraid
the
grand
pensionary
smiled
what
should
he
hunt
but
herons
mynheer
you
are
too
by
heaven
i
would
not
have
let
him
de
witt
turned
over
the
reports
brought
him
by
florent
he
hath
gone
count
nor
will
he
return
till
i
will
as
you
urge
me
again
see
him
on
the
subject
of
these
and
also
concerning
his
party
in
the
assembly
added
montbas
who
hamper
us
at
every
step
he
has
no
power
with
i
do
not
know
they
use
his
name
and
would
do
that
whether
he
would
or
no
and
the
princess
amalia
interrupted
de
montbas
look
to
her
she
is
ever
i
know
yet
it
is
to
little
purpose
at
heart
she
is
afraid
of
but
she
will
serve
her
grandson
s
cause
and
by
any
means
if
she
have
but
the
i
might
see
her
also
mused
de
witt
i
know
she
is
timid
the
door
was
opened
and
van
ouvenaller
took
a
few
steps
into
the
room
a
man
hath
just
ridden
up
to
the
binnenhof
mynheer
who
earnestly
desires
to
see
you
said
the
secretary
his
name
is
captain
van
haren
of
the
garrison
at
the
grand
pensionary
did
not
know
the
name
nay
i
can
not
see
him
now
he
answered
his
business
must
wait
nor
should
you
have
broken
in
upon
us
with
this
van
mynheer
answered
the
secretary
colouring
this
man
says
he
bears
a
letter
from
the
prince
of
from
the
prince
of
orange
cried
de
montbas
rising
i
beseech
you
breathed
john
de
witt
giving
him
a
quick
look
then
he
turned
to
van
ouvenaller
admit
this
captain
van
florent
felt
his
pulses
throbbing
his
blood
stirring
he
advanced
a
little
farther
into
the
room
glancing
furtively
from
the
agitated
countenance
of
the
count
de
montbas
to
the
composed
features
of
john
de
witt
captain
van
haren
entered
a
stout
and
stolid
soldier
muddy
and
wet
you
are
unknown
to
me
mynheer
said
the
grand
pensionary
quietly
i
am
the
commander
of
the
garrison
at
vlaardingen
on
the
maas
mynheer
his
highness
the
prince
of
orange
rested
there
this
morning
he
dispatched
me
with
this
the
prince
at
vlaardingen
cried
de
montbas
and
rapidly
flushed
and
rapidly
paled
again
for
the
second
time
the
grand
pensionary
checked
him
with
a
look
holding
out
his
hand
for
the
letter
without
lowering
his
eyes
to
it
he
spoke
what
took
the
prince
to
vlaardingen
he
was
on
his
way
to
they
said
he
goes
to
zeeland
questioned
de
witt
and
his
eyes
narrowed
i
think
so
a
fierce
exclamation
broke
from
de
montbas
but
john
de
witt
in
silence
tore
the
seals
of
the
letter
it
was
headed
vlaardingen
on
the
maas
mynheer
it
ran
as
i
am
now
arrived
at
an
age
when
i
can
claim
the
heritage
of
my
house
i
am
proceeding
on
the
invitation
of
zeeland
to
middelburg
there
to
take
my
seat
as
premier
noble
of
that
state
her
highness
the
princess
of
orange
and
his
serene
highness
the
elector
of
brandenburg
have
been
pleased
to
declare
me
of
age
i
did
not
consider
it
necessary
to
request
permission
of
their
high
mightinesses
before
i
took
this
journey
upon
my
return
to
the
hague
i
shall
be
desirous
of
personally
conveying
to
you
my
affection
and
duty
william
prince
of
john
de
witt
laid
the
letter
down
florent
thought
that
his
face
his
whole
bearing
had
wonderfully
changed
his
highness
was
accompanied
he
asked
by
his
household
and
a
company
of
young
he
hath
gone
to
rouse
zeeland
cried
de
montbas
de
witt
handed
him
the
prince
s
letter
you
should
not
have
allowed
his
highness
to
leave
vlaardingen
he
said
sternly
to
captain
van
haren
not
he
but
their
high
mightinesses
are
your
his
highness
told
me
that
he
went
to
join
prince
john
maurice
answered
the
soldier
i
did
not
know
that
it
was
against
the
wishes
of
their
high
against
their
wishes
and
mine
said
john
de
witt
this
is
an
act
of
rebellion
on
the
prince
s
part
we
have
been
too
lenient
get
back
to
vlaardingen
captain
van
haren
and
be
careful
how
ye
serve
the
to
florent
eagerly
watching
was
revealed
a
new
phase
of
the
grand
pensionary
he
saw
him
moved
if
composed
roused
and
dominant
the
gentleness
that
might
have
covered
weakness
was
shown
to
be
but
the
cloak
of
undaunted
strength
he
held
his
head
high
and
the
prominence
of
his
jaw
was
emphasised
by
the
set
of
the
mouth
get
back
to
vlaardingen
he
repeated
and
remember
that
their
high
mightinesses
will
endure
no
riots
nor
disturbances
in
the
name
of
this
most
presumptuous
young
the
captain
saluted
and
withdrew
as
the
door
closed
on
him
de
montbas
looked
up
from
the
letter
fluttering
in
his
hand
this
is
a
challenge
he
said
john
de
witt
s
brows
were
contracted
yea
i
think
we
have
been
fooled
cried
de
montbas
bitterly
fooled
by
this
docile
sickly
boy
he
rose
and
dashed
the
letter
on
to
the
table
where
is
your
policy
of
concession
now
what
of
this
good
citizen
you
were
making
out
of
a
tyrant
s
son
i
have
been
deceived
answered
the
grand
pensionary
sternly
as
ye
say
fooled
his
eyes
expressed
an
anger
that
florent
would
not
have
believed
them
capable
of
so
utterly
did
it
contradict
their
usual
look
of
stately
kindliness
who
would
have
thought
that
there
were
such
guile
and
deception
in
this
young
man
i
have
warned
you
said
de
montbas
he
was
over
quiet
and
never
could
i
imagine
that
one
of
his
house
would
be
content
with
a
subservient
my
eyes
are
opened
now
de
witt
rose
perhaps
it
is
better
that
he
and
i
should
meet
without
disguise
since
he
hath
rejected
my
friendship
it
is
well
that
i
should
know
he
drew
a
quick
breath
and
for
a
moment
it
seemed
as
if
the
old
hatred
fought
against
so
long
carefully
concealed
and
never
acted
upon
was
asserting
itself
the
hatred
of
the
stern
republican
for
princely
insolence
and
tyranny
the
hatred
of
the
son
of
jacob
de
witt
the
innocent
prisoner
of
loevenstein
for
the
son
of
the
man
who
had
flung
him
there
de
montbas
saw
the
expression
and
read
it
by
the
light
of
his
own
bitter
dislike
to
william
of
orange
you
have
been
acting
on
your
principles
instead
of
your
instincts
he
said
in
your
heart
you
never
trusted
i
have
ever
done
him
justice
answered
john
de
witt
and
treated
him
in
such
a
manner
that
this
act
of
his
this
contemptuous
blow
in
the
face
of
my
authority
is
base
you
never
loved
him
insisted
de
montbas
in
the
same
kind
of
trembling
nervous
anger
though
ye
have
had
the
tutoring
of
him
ye
never
loved
the
grand
pensionary
looked
straightly
into
the
soldier
s
face
nay
i
never
loved
him
he
said
it
was
not
but
you
trusted
it
is
my
habit
returned
de
witt
proudly
to
trust
those
with
whom
i
de
montbas
shrugged
his
shoulders
impatiently
to
florent
s
covertly
observant
eyes
he
seemed
in
an
agitation
bordering
on
fear
to
join
prince
john
maurice
at
breda
ejaculated
the
grand
pensionary
it
is
a
scheme
concocted
with
the
princess
dowager
the
prince
was
recently
at
cleves
who
besides
would
he
have
with
him
heenvliet
renswoude
and
boreel
i
thought
that
i
could
have
trusted
them
but
bromley
and
van
odyk
i
had
intention
of
replacing
they
are
at
the
bottom
of
this
the
prince
and
no
one
but
the
prince
is
at
the
bottom
of
this
cried
de
montbas
the
grand
pensionary
gave
a
stern
smile
you
think
i
have
been
weak
i
have
only
acted
as
i
considered
right
and
as
i
should
act
again
maybe
even
yet
i
may
by
persuasion
overcome
this
youth
s
worldly
ambition
if
not
we
the
states
and
i
are
capable
of
sterner
they
should
have
been
used
de
montbas
suppressed
his
impatient
voice
where
you
have
once
been
so
utterly
deceived
can
you
ever
confide
again
if
william
of
orange
will
do
this
what
will
he
not
do
the
speaker
s
sallow
face
flushed
with
the
energy
of
his
feelings
france
and
england
who
neglected
him
when
he
was
nothing
in
the
state
begin
to
court
him
now
why
should
he
not
revenge
himself
on
the
party
that
deprived
him
of
his
inheritance
by
intriguing
for
sovereign
power
with
our
enemies
m
de
montbas
you
go
too
far
interrupted
the
grand
pensionary
we
have
neither
right
nor
reason
to
suspect
the
prince
of
these
deep
designs
he
is
a
boy
misled
by
his
this
is
clever
work
for
a
boy
replied
the
count
with
a
sour
smile
he
has
outwitted
you
that
is
no
shame
to
it
may
be
a
danger
to
the
state
was
the
swift
answer
you
blame
me
said
the
grand
pensionary
quietly
i
do
not
doubt
that
on
all
sides
i
shall
receive
he
moved
slowly
back
to
his
desk
and
de
montbas
sprang
from
his
chair
ay
you
have
been
wrong
from
the
first
you
can
not
tame
an
eagle
with
sugar
and
smiles
if
you
want
to
keep
him
you
cage
him
otherwise
he
will
fly
as
soon
as
he
is
able
though
he
may
have
taken
your
friendliness
while
his
wings
were
i
did
what
i
would
do
again
repeated
john
de
witt
firmly
and
without
bitterness
he
picked
up
the
prince
s
letter
and
looked
at
it
again
the
princess
and
the
elector
his
guardians
declare
him
of
age
it
follows
he
will
be
claiming
a
seat
in
the
council
of
state
he
remarked
zeeland
will
demand
the
restoration
of
the
stadtholdership
added
de
montbas
de
witt
spoke
thoughtfully
there
will
be
a
fierce
fight
perhaps
i
could
gain
the
princess
at
least
i
will
see
he
glanced
at
the
blue
china
clock
on
the
mantelshelf
the
assembly
is
now
sitting
he
remarked
we
have
not
yet
decided
the
question
of
these
riots
said
de
montbas
this
letter
puts
a
different
complexion
on
the
de
witt
folded
and
placed
it
in
his
pocket
as
he
spoke
i
must
set
the
whole
affair
before
the
he
turned
to
the
secretary
will
you
lock
up
those
papers
in
my
desk
mynheer
van
mander
yes
without
further
speech
the
grand
pensionary
and
de
montbas
left
the
room
florent
did
as
he
had
been
directed
with
a
mechanical
intelligence
of
the
hands
leaving
free
the
excited
workings
of
his
brain
upon
what
he
had
just
heard
and
the
meaning
of
it
he
put
away
the
papers
neatly
in
their
various
drawers
he
was
about
in
the
same
absorbed
fashion
to
lock
the
desk
when
a
sudden
unexpected
thought
held
him
still
what
were
these
papers
without
a
doubt
valuable
to
hyacinthe
croix
to
william
of
orange
and
they
lay
there
before
him
at
his
mercy
to
read
to
copy
to
steal
prudence
no
longer
restrained
him
in
the
last
he
had
decided
to
remain
not
another
day
in
the
service
of
de
witt
he
had
nothing
to
gain
from
the
grand
pensionary
yet
he
stood
in
the
hazy
sunlight
hesitating
the
key
in
his
hand
and
the
open
desk
before
him
croix
would
pay
him
well
but
he
was
not
thinking
of
croix
what
would
the
prince
give
for
the
contents
of
the
private
desk
of
de
witt
florent
did
not
want
money
but
he
craved
to
stand
for
something
to
be
of
value
to
merit
consideration
in
the
eyes
of
this
young
man
who
had
suddenly
unfurled
the
orange
standard
and
what
had
he
to
offer
but
the
poor
services
any
clerk
could
give
still
he
hesitated
but
that
same
recollection
that
filled
him
with
hot
desire
to
serve
william
of
orange
held
him
back
thinking
of
william
of
orange
he
could
not
do
it
he
locked
the
desk
and
went
into
the
outer
room
to
give
the
key
to
van
den
bosch
the
clerks
of
de
witt
were
discussing
the
situation
in
a
subdued
agitation
florent
tendered
the
key
half
defiantly
are
you
leaving
asked
bacherus
with
a
look
of
surprise
on
his
wrinkled
face
florent
answered
briefly
and
took
his
hat
and

down
from
a
peg
what
do
you
think
of
this
news
from
zeeland
asked
van
ouvenaller
adjusting
his
spectacles
i
am
sorry
for
de
witt
returned
florent
dryly
van
ouvenaller
rubbed
his
chin
these
are
troublesome
times
he
remarked
gloomily
florent
left
the
room
and
the
binnenhof
the
hague
was
already
alive
with
excitement
the
streets
seethed
with
unrest
the
daring
of
the
prince
s
exploit
made
it
almost
unbelievable
this
and
that
rumour
were
spread
and
contradicted
the
burgher
companies
were
out
and
by
the
time
florent
had
reached
the
plaats
it
was
announced
that
de
montbas
was
in
council
with
the
states
and
that
a
message
had
been
sent
to
hellevoetsluis
where
de
ruyter
lay
with
the
fleet
these
messages
intended
to
quiet
the
people
s
fears
of
a
d
on
the
part
of
the
prince
were
received
with
derision
there
were
more
orange
favours
worn
than
white
ones
and
more
satisfaction
than
anger
expressed
at
the
success
of
the
prince
s
enterprise
in
the
kneuterdyk
avenue
close
to
de
witt
s
house
florent
met
croix
they
exchanged
hasty
greeting
in
the
crowd
you
have
heard
the
news
the
frenchman
smiled
you
received
the
returned
packet
retorted
florent
yes
the
prince
is
prudent
to
refuse
to
enter
into
negotiations
that
are
bound
to
be
such
was
not
florent
s
reading
of
the
action
will
you
come
to
my
lodgings
he
asked
we
can
not
talk
they
parted
florent
smiled
rather
grimly
to
himself
croix
would
find
his
new
prey
flown
since
de
witt
s
secretary
had
decided
not
to
remain
another
hour
in
the
hague
chapter
vi
middelburg
crowds
came
in
on
all
sides
the
streets
were
nearly
impassable
windows
roofs
even
masts
and
trees
black
with
spectators
the
abbey
was
so
full
of
people
in
carriages
and
on
foot
that
it
was
hardly
possible
to
reach
the
prince
s
apartments
nor
must
i
forget
to
tell
your
highness
that
during
the
two
hours
the
prince
stood
at
the
window
the
civic
militia
fired
salutes
in
his
honour
and
they
are
still
sending
up
fireworks
from
the
stadhuis
his
highness
reached
here
yesterday
at
three
o
clock
his
yacht
sailed
through
shipping
dressed
with
flags
and
these
vessels
answered
his
salutes
with
a
triple
discharge
of
their
guns
the
magistrates
of
the
town
had
come
down
to
the
quay
to
receive
him
the
burgher
companies
were
under
arms
he
entered
a
coach
and
six
and
was
conducted
to
the
abbey
where
the
deputies
of
the
state
came
to
congratulate
him
the
councillor
pensionary
made
a
speech
to
him
in
their
name
and
the
different
representatives
of
the
provincial
government
followed
his
example
his
highness
is
to
be
conducted
to
the
hall
of
assembly
the
loyalty
of
the
people
is
beyond
a
question
prince
john
maurice
of
nassau
hath
remained
at
under
pretence
of
illness
fearing
to
compromise
himself
in
the
eyes
of
the
government
by
sharing
in
this
dangerous
enterprise
but
your
highness
need
have
no
fear
the
prudence
of
the
prince
balances
his
youth
and
he
would
have
reason
to
complain
of
me
if
i
did
not
say
that
his
management
of
this
affair
has
shown
a
wisdom
far
beyond
his
lange
jan
struck
after
a
prelude
of
dancing
bells
the
hour
of
two
and
bromley
laid
down
his
pen
and
looked
round
his
own
elation
and
excitement
had
found
pleasurable
vent
in
this
letter
to
the
princess
dowager
which
he
wrote
by
the
prince
s
orders
to
give
some
account
of
the
reception
in
middelburg
he
had
sat
over
it
longer
than
he
had
thought
it
was
with
some
slight
shock
that
he
realised
it
to
be
deep
into
the
night
middelburg
was
still
at
last
the
crowds
had
departed
from
the
courtyard
of
the
abbey
the
bells
had
ceased
to
ring
the
military
salutes
were
hushed
the
town
lay
silent
under
the
september
stars
bromley
went
to
the
small
pointed
gothic
window
of
his
chamber
and
looked
out
opposite
clear
in
the
moonlight
rose
the
three
pointed
towers
of
the
southern
side
of
the
abbey
the
windows
projecting
from
the
sloping
roof
threw
distinct
shadows
and
the
vanes
on
the
three
turrets
turned
slowly
in
the
wind
through
the
dark
gate
above
which
could
be
seen
carved
deep
in
the
stone
the
zeeland
lion
rising
from
the
waves
was
the
figure
of
the
sentry
walking
up
and
down
the
moonlight
glittering
on
his
halbert
the
courtyard
was
filled
with
trees
now
almost
bare
of
their
leaves
that
cast
a
dark
tracery
of
shadow
on
the
ground
with
their
softly
stirring
branches
again
the
melancholy
little
air
rang
out
and
lange
jan
struck
a
quarter
past
the
hour
the
sound
was
close
and
loud
since
the
groote
kerk
adjoined
the
abbey
wing
and
the
tall
rose
immediately
behind
bromley
s
room
a
small
chamber
communicating
with
the
prince
s
apartments
these
chimes
that
at
every
quarter
of
an
hour
were
ringing
out
over
the
seven
provinces
day
and
night
had
a
curious
almost
uncanny
meaning
for
the
englishman
he
had
never
become
used
to
them
often
at
the
hague
he
would
wake
up
to
hear
the
chimes
of
the
groote
kerk
and
always
with
a
start
so
loud
so
insistent
yet
so
melancholy
were
these
old
bells
ringing
out
dutifully
as
their
makers
had
bidden
them
as
every
fifteen
minutes
passed
so
had
they
rung
here
in
middelburg
when
the
counties
of
holland
stepped
this
abbey
so
did
they
ring
in
the
sunny
spaces
of
the
afternoon
above
a
silent
town
and
so
in
the
utter
stillness
of
the
night
their
mournful
carillon
played
unheeding
the
notes
of
warning
of
sadness
of
remembrance
bromley
took
his
heavy
brass
candlestick
from
the
table
and
placed
it
on
the
mantelshelf
put
away
his
unfinished
letter
and
was
about
to
undress
when
a
soft
knock
upon
the
door
interrupted
him
he
opened
it
heenvliet
the
prince
s
first
stood
without
holding
a
candle
he
was
fully
dressed
the
messenger
from
the
hague
has
arrived
i
and
van
odyk
were
not
yet
abed
so
saw
him
come
up
to
the
abbey
van
odyk
thinks
his
highness
should
see
the
letters
from
whom
are
they
asked
bromley
the
princess
and
de
they
can
wait
till
the
morning
the
prince
sleeps
so
m
van
odyk
thought
he
should
have
time
to
consider
them
before
he
makes
his
speech
in
the
assembly
is
every
one
else
abed
well
i
will
go
rouse
his
highness
said
bromley
reluctantly
will
you
desire
van
odyk
to
come
up
with
the
letters
heenvliet
withdrew
and
bromley
crossed
to
the
adjoining
chamber
a
long
low
apartment
that
the
fitful
light
of
his
single
candle
showed
hung
with
tapestries
and
to
be
plainly
but
richly
furnished
middelburg
abbey
had
been
the
palace
of
the
prince
s
ancestors
and
still
retained
some
of
the
splendour
of
those
days
at
the
farther
end
of
this
room
was
the
door
leading
into
the
prince
s
bedroom
bromley
hesitated
he
was
inclined
to
think
the
letters
might
have
waited
william
slept
badly
at
best
and
must
need
all
that
he
could
get
of
rest
there
was
no
intermediary
whom
bromley
might
consult
since
the
prince
had
left
both
valet
and
page
at
the
hague
having
indeed
no
excuse
for
taking
servants
on
a
hunting
expedition
he
knocked
gently
and
received
no
answer
lange
jan
shook
his
chimes
into
the
night
again
there
was
a
pause
as
his
melody
died
away
then
bromley
opened
the
door
the
candle
revealed
a
handsome
square
room
with
a
painted
beamed
ceiling
walls
hung
with
stamped
leather
and
two
windows
unshuttered
and
set
open
the
moonlight
streamed
through
and
lay
along
the
polished
floor
the
bed
with
its
plain
but
richly
worked
hangings
stood
fronting
the
window
on
a
table
at
the
foot
were
a
silver
candlestick
a
couple
of
small
books
and
a
watch
lying
on
a
lace
handkerchief
across
the
wooden
chair
beside
the
bed
were
spread
the
prince
s
green
velvet
his
black
sash
his
gloves
and
mechlin
cravat
and
hanging
on
the
wall
above
his
beaver
with
the
long
ostrich
plume
another
chair
set
in
a
corner
and
covered
with
a
high
gothic
canopy
held
across
its
carved
arms
the
prince
s
and
the
piled
up
addresses
presented
to
him
yesterday
bromley
paused
he
could
hear
the
regular
rather
laboured
breathing
of
the
sleeper
and
no
other
sound
he
went
up
to
the
bed
and
shading
the
candle
looked
down
the
curtains
were
gathered
back
within
their
cords
and
revealed
the
prince
lying
on
his
side
his
head
raised
by
a
pile
of
pillows
his
hands
outside
the
coverlet
any
one
not
knowing
him
so
well
as
did
bromley
would
have
been
startled
by
the
extreme
pallor
of
the
face
which
had
an
almost
deathlike
look
in
contrast
with
the
tumbled
auburn
hair
his
whole
appearance
was
more
that
of
one
in
a
swoon
than
in
normal
sleep
save
that
his
lips
were
closed
firmly
and
his
fine
nostrils
quivered
with
his
breathing
your
highness
said
bromley
and
moved
his
hand
so
that
the
candlelight
flashed
over
the
bed
william
gave
a
little
sigh
and
opened
his
great
eyes
is
that
you
bromley
yes
sir
it
is
the
prince
sat
up
in
a
moment
alert
and
composed
it
was
wonderful
how
his
eyes
gave
life
and
animation
to
his
pale
and
frail
appearance
the
look
of
great
delicacy
so
noticeable
in
his
sleep
seemed
hardly
there
when
his
brilliant
glance
dominated
his
face
what
is
it
he
asked
a
messenger
from
the
hague
highness
with
they
could
have
waited
till
the
morning
answered
william
fretfully
one
is
from
de
still
it
could
have
stayed
ye
need
not
have
roused
me
for
a
message
from
de
another
is
from
the
princess
the
prince
pushed
the
heavy
hair
back
from
his
forehead
she
is
a
silly
old
woman
he
declared
and
a
letter
from
her
does
not
interest
me
at
bromley
who
had
an
unconfessed
liking
for
the
princess
ventured
to
answer
her
highness
hath
been
under
great
anxiety
as
to
your
safety
oh
pshaw
returned
william
she
hath
made
her
peace
with
the
republic
by
now
who
suggested
waking
me
m
van
odyk
highness
he
is
coming
up
he
thought
you
would
wish
to
consider
these
letters
at
m
van
odyk
sometimes
exceeds
his
duty
remarked
the
prince
calmly
and
nothing
any
one
can
write
or
say
will
cause
me
to
alter
my
intentions
i
wish
you
would
put
that
candle
down
bromley
it
is
flickering
bromley
obeyed
it
is
caused
by
the
open
windows
highness
he
answered
no
candle
will
burn
straight
in
this
close
them
said
the
prince
petulantly
bromley
again
obeyed
forbearing
to
comment
on
the
fact
that
the
room
was
chilled
with
the
night
air
for
he
knew
that
the
prince
could
not
sleep
or
indeed
hardly
breathe
with
the
windows
shut
william
leant
back
against
the
head
of
the
bed
his
lawn
shirt
the
sheets
pillows
and
his
face
were
turned
to
the
same
ivory
hue
in
the
candlelight
why
were
you
not
abed
bromley
he
asked
i
was
writing
to
the
princess
did
you
say
prince
john
maurice
had
stayed
at
yes
he
will
have
told
the
princess
himself
remarked
william
being
by
now
recovered
of
his
sickness
he
added
dryly
shall
i
see
if
van
odyk
hath
returned
asked
bromley
bring
him
here
commanded
william
briefly
the
englishman
returned
in
the
dark
to
his
room
and
reached
it
as
van
odyk
appeared
at
the
door
the
prince
is
awake
and
will
see
you
but
he
was
not
over
pleased
to
be
the
matter
is
important
answered
van
odyk
bromley
had
no
more
to
say
william
van
odyk
rich
a
connection
of
the
house
of
orange
clever
son
of
the
man
who
was
once
the
most
trusted
adviser
of
the
prince
s
mother
had
perhaps
as
much
of
william
of
orange
s
confidence
as
he
ever
bestowed
on
any
one
for
those
placed
about
the
prince
were
not
of
his
own
choosing
he
had
always
been
too
restricted
to
be
able
to
find
advisers
or
confidants
his
grandmother
he
had
never
forgiven
for
her
overtures
to
the
republican
party
and
such
men
as
he
had
given
his
rare
friendship
to
cornelius
triglandt
the
lord
of
zuylestein
and
william
bentinck
had
been
removed
from
him
by
de
witt
the
few
who
had
followed
him
to
middelburg
he
tolerated
he
had
no
great
trust
in
them
but
relied
on
his
own
genius
for
command
to
make
these
or
any
others
subservient
to
him
when
bromley
returned
with
van
odyk
to
the
prince
s
chamber
they
found
him
half
dressed
and
seated
at
the
table
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
snuffing
the
candle
he
looked
up
as
they
entered
and
smiled
with
his
eyes
bromley
he
said
i
have
absolutely
no
clothes
at
all
and
those
we
begged
from
prince
john
maurice
he
added
with
a
touch
of
humour
are
so
utterly
too
bromley
was
compunctious
i
am
sorry
highness
it
was
forgotten
i
can
procure
you
anything
you
wish
in
the
town
highness
interrupted
van
odyk
nay
it
is
no
matter
answered
the
prince
only
i
should
have
been
grateful
to
the
states
of
zeeland
for
a
now
where
are
these
letters
mynheer
van
odyk
laid
them
on
the
table
and
bromley
withdrew
the
prince
picked
up
the
letter
from
de
witt
and
opened
it
bending
closer
to
the
candle
william
van
odyk
lord
of
beverwaert
handsome
gay
worldly
a
frivolous
youth
behind
him
and
no
ambitions
ahead
beyond
the
pleasure
of
an
adventure
stood
in
the
window
embrasure
and
observed
him
curiously
so
slight
a
boy
to
have
thrown
down
this
bold
challenge
to
the
power
whom
he
regarded
as
a
usurper
thereby
destroying
at
a
blow
the
policy
of
conciliation
john
de
witt
had
pursued
so
unflinchingly
for
eighteen
years
but
william
of
orange
had
been
pursuing
his
policy
almost
as
long
a
diplomat
from
his
cradle
he
had
affected
a
resignation
to
his
position
that
the
grand
pensionary
had
never
doubted
and
that
the
lord
of
beverwaert
himself
had
been
deceived
in
until
within
the
last
two
years
he
recalled
now
as
he
watched
the
prince
read
his
letter
with
what
interest
he
had
followed
william
s
behaviour
in
the
hands
of
the
republican
party
how
he
and
other
partisans
of
the
house
of
orange
had
had
their
hopes
half
crushed
by
the
prince
s
taciturn
gravity
and
natural
reserve
which
made
it
impossible
to
guess
his
real
designs
he
had
grown
up
in
an
atmosphere
of
adversity
been
educated
in
a
school
of
distrust
and
the
constant
necessity
he
was
under
of
concealing
his
passions
had
made
him
while
yet
a
child
an
adept
in
dissimulation
he
had
never
made
the
slightest
attempt
to
gain
the
affection
or
confidence
of
the
faction
always
loyally
supporting
his
house
he
had
neither
the
virtues
nor
the
vices
that
are
loved
by
the
crowd
his
life
was
austere
his
tastes
sober
he
was
rarely
seen
and
always
silent
van
odyk
was
thinking
now
how
little
he
really
knew
of
him
twice
this
boy
s
age
and
man
of
the
world
as
he
was
he
had
never
drawn
more
from
the
prince
than
his
now
almost
public
intention
to
claim
the
inheritance
of
his
family
the
lord
of
beverwaert
brought
energy
talents
and
goodwill
to
the
cause
but
little
confidence
of
the
mighty
almost
regal
power
that
had
once
belonged
to
the
house
of
orange
nothing
remained
to
this
young
man
but
the
renown
of
his
ancestors
and
what
force
courage
or
strength
he
might
find
in
himself
william
van
odyk
wondered
and
fixed
his
pleasant
blue
eyes
in
such
an
intent
fashion
on
the
prince
that
the
latter
looked
up
and
glanced
at
him
keenly
m
de
witt
writes
at
length
he
said
and
laid
the
letter
down
to
what
purpose
does
he
write

the
lord
of

william
motioned
to
the
chair
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
will
you
not
sit
mynheer
van
odyk
took
his
place
opposite
to
the
prince
and
the
solitary
candle
that
illuminated
them
both
showed
a
striking
contrast
in
their
persons
the
lord
of
beverwaert
florid
fair
his
gallant
good
looks
displayed
to
advantage
by
his
handsome
red
uniform
his
gold
baldric
and
sash
tall
stoutly
built
bearing
every
sign
of
easy
pleasant
living
with
eyes
slightly
dissipated
and
a
mouth
a
little
full
and
soft
in
contour
the
prince
delicate
and
even
weakly
in
appearance
his
green
coat
flung
on
carelessly
over
his
laced
shirt
wearing
and
dusty
drooping
a
little
as
he
sat
with
an
air
of
weariness
and
gravity
at
variance
with
his
years
yet
conveying
with
every
movement
the
charm
of
youth
and
an
unconscious
aristocratic
grace
a
precocious
maturity
stamped
on
his
proud
and
composed
features
yet
showing
in
his
brilliant
eyes
the
fire
of
youthful
blood
and
the
energy
of
a
haughty
race
he
tore
open
the
other
letter
glanced
over
it
and
put
it
down
m
de
witt
has
seen
the
princess
he
said
she
is
of
course
frightened
for
your
safety
highness
for
her
own
share
in
this
affair
flattered
too
i
think
by
de
witt
s
overtures
she
never
could
resist
tampering
with
the
republic
she
has
always
injured
me
with
her
intrigues
he
added
with
feeling
and
de
witt
he
bids
me
take
care
what
i
say
to
the
states
of
zeeland
warns
me
that
he
withdraws
his
promise
with
regard
to
the
council
of
state
that
he
will
in
fact
do
all
in
his
power
to
prevent
my
election
and
that
since
i
have
proved
myself
his
enemy
he
can
not
treat
me
as
his
friend
there
is
a
great
deal
more
very
worthy
matter
but
that
is
the
pith
of
he
took
up
his
grandmother
s
letter
her
highness
would
keep
on
good
terms
with
de
witt
she
advises
me
to
say
as
little
as
possible
here
and
to
return
as
quietly
as
may
what
do
you
think
of
this
advice
asked
van
odyk
william
gave
him
a
quick
keen
glance
do
you
imagine
that
it
could
make
any
difference
to
your
intentions
highness
i
think
it
will
not
highness
smiled
the
lord
of
beverwaert
i
shall
speak
in
the
assembly
as
i
intended
to
speak
said
the
prince
composedly
yet
it
would
be
worth
a
little
prudence
to
secure
the
good
graces
of
de
the
prince
s
eyes
flickered
over
him
at
this
in
a
manner
conveying
that
van
odyk
had
but
a
small
share
of
william
s
confidence
or
esteem
i
have
never
lacked
caution
he
said
quietly
and
you
know
mynheer
that
i
had
to
forego
de
witt
s
good
graces
when
i
undertook
this
i
know
but
now
the
thing
is
done
you
can
excuse
yourself
william
interrupted
mynheer
what
use
are
the
good
graces
of
de
witt
to
me
the
lord
of
beverwaert
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
represents
the
united
the
prince
pushed
back
the
heavy
reddish
curls
that
gave
such
a
marked
character
to
his
face
the
united
provinces
and
i
understand
each
other
he
answered
impatiently
without
the
intervention
of
de
then
seeing
the
look
in
van
odyk
s
face
he
blushed
with
vexation
lest
he
had
been
betrayed
for
once
into
an
expression
too
outspoken
i
shall
offend
de
witt
no
further
than
i
can
help
he
added
his
manner
instantly
restrained
again
he
looked
down
at
the
princess
s
letter
that
he
still
held
we
will
return
to
the
hague
mynheer
and
i
will
see
her
highness
before
she
becomes
enmeshed
in
you
have
not
much
confidence
in
her
highness
remarked
the
lord
of
beverwaert
what
can
one
expect
from
a
woman
returned
the
prince
in
a
tone
of
quiet
but
boundless
contempt
i
thank
god
i
can
take
my
affairs
into
my
own
hands
uncontrollable
annoyance
clouded
his
face
but
for
her
i
had
never
lost
orange
and
my
estates
have
been
utterly
mismanaged
it
will
be
a
month
s
work
straightening
her
accounts
the
land
hath
been
left
unsold
and
i
have
as
many
debts
as
a
captain
of
cavalry
he
checked
himself
with
his
habitual
distrust
as
if
he
repented
already
of
such
a
long
speech
and
rose
taking
up
the
candle
van
odyk
accepted
his
dismissal
i
need
not
have
disturbed
your
highness
he
said
rising
it
is
no
matter
answered
the
prince
with
a
little
cough
lange
jan
struck
but
neither
noticed
how
his
noisy
chimes
broke
the
stillness
of
the
night
for
each
had
heard
such
peals
ringing
out
over
the
seven
provinces
every
hour
of
every
day
and
night
since
they
could
remember
anything
the
lord
of
beverwaert
took
the
candle
from
the
prince
and
opened
the
door
i
forgot
to
tell
your
highness
a
man
came
here
from
the
hague
he
desired
to
see
you
but
the
crowd
made
it
impossible
he
wished
to
join
your
service
i
do
not
think
that
it
was
a
matter
of
any
who
was
he
asked
william
holding
his
brow
one
florent
van
mander
who
has
been
with
de
i
remember
him
said
the
prince
i
told
him
to
return
he
is
rather
hasty
in
changing
masters
said
william
with
a
half
malicious
smile
in
his
eyes
i
can
not
pay
as
well
as
de
witt
there
are
those
would
rather
serve
you
highness
thank
you
william
held
out
his
beautiful
aristocratic
hand
and
the
lord
of
beverwaert
kissed
it
shall
i
send
bromley
to
you
highness
no
i
require
but
van
odyk
hesitated
you
look
very
pale
i
am
remorseful
that
i
disturbed
oh
as
to
that
the
prince
gave
a
sudden
brilliant
smile
i
have
a
damnable
headache
which
is
too
ordinary
an
affair
to
be
remarked
on
is
it
not
do
not
rouse
poor
bromley
and
get
to
bed
yourself
shall
i
not
leave
the
candle
highness
nay
i
have
another
the
prince
closed
the
door
on
the
lord
of
beverwaert
and
returned
to
the
table
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
he
began
to
strike
the
flint
and
tinder
but
a
sudden
cough
shook
him
so
that
he
had
to
put
the
box
down
in
order
to
hold
his
head
suddenly
throbbing
with
acute
agony
for
a
while
he
sat
quiet
drawing
his
breath
painfully
then
at
a
second
attempt
lit
the
candle
and
the
tall
flame
sprang
up
and
mingled
with
the
moonlight
the
prince
thrust
the
two
letters
into
the
pocket
of
his
coat
and
moved
the
candle
away
from
his
eyes
then
he
drew
towards
him
the
books
on
the
table
one
a
bible
with
silver
corners
and
clasps
the
other
or
portrait
of
a
christian
by
cornelius
triglandt
humbly
bound
in
black
william
languidly
opened
this
then
glanced
at
the
watch
beside
his
elbow
it
was
close
on
four
o
clock
resting
his
head
in
his
hand
he
lifted
his
eyes
and
gazed
at
the
moonlit
square
of
window
he
could
see
rising
opposite
against
the
clear
sky
the
turrets
of
the
abbey
their
weathervanes
turning
in
the
cold
and
the
boughs
of
the
elms
decked
scantily
with
their
last
leaves
william
glanced
again
at
the
book
it
lay
open
at
the
that
bore
his
arms
the
lion
rampant
against
the
billets
and
underneath
his
motto
je
sera
nassau
moi
je
the
prince
put
his
hand
down
on
the
page
and
drew
a
quick
but
instantly
repressed
breath
over
the
sleeping
city
the
old
clock
chimed
again
the
little
ancient
melody
the
jangling
strokes
william
leant
back
in
the
chair
the
candle
cast
his
shadow
moving
and
fantastic
on
the
wall
behind
him
drew
out
lines
of
red
gold
in
his
hair
and
threw
a
faint
glow
over
his
colourless
features
it
was
utterly
silent
save
for
his
labouring
breath
triglandt
s
book

open
beside
the
light

over
the
motto

chapter
vii
the
manifesto
the
prince
s
gentlemen
and
the
knights
and
nobles
of
zeeland
were
gathered
in
the
council
chamber
of
the
abbey
talking
together
in
twos
and
threes
the
room
was
large
and
light
and
barely
furnished
on
the
wall
facing
the
windows
hung
the
famous
tapestries
representing
the
dutch
victories
over
the
spanish
and
on
the
hearth
some
logs
were
burning
for
the
day
was
raw
and
chilly
and
the
trees
without
tossed
against
a
grey
sky
many
of
the
younger
men
richly
dressed
were
laughing
walking
about
impatiently
striking
their
on
their
high
boots
and
exchanging
daring
comments
on
de
witt
it
was
to
curb
the
impetuousness
of
these
youthful
nobles
that
the
princess
dowager
had
summoned
the
old
prince
john
maurice
from
cleves
thinking
he
would
take
her
grandson
under
his
protection
but
seventy
proving
more
timorous
than
seventeen
william
was
left
to
manage
alone
the
enthusiasm
and
recklessness
of
his
followers
in
one
of
the
window
embrasures
the
lord
of
zuylestein
stood
conversing
with
van
odyk
heenvliet
the
first
and
renswoude
the
first
equerry
the
perpetual
chimes
announced
nine
o
clock
and
the
prince
entered
accompanied
by
bromley
he
saluted
all
of
them
and
advanced
with
an
outstretched
hand
to
de
zuylestein
who
had
once
possessed
his
entire
confidence
and
though
the
years
of
separation
had
weakened
the
friendship
between
them
william
was
still
gracious
did
you
sleep
well
highness
asked
de
zuylestein
who
only
unbent
his
haughty
manner
to
the
prince
as
usual
he
pulled
his
gloves
from
his
and
slowly
drew
them
on
it
was
noticeable
that
he
used
no
arts
to
ingratiate
himself
with
his
supporters
his
manner
was
distant
and
reserved
he
hardly
glanced
at
those
about
him
under
his
heavy
black
beaver
his
face
showed
composed
and
inscrutable
at
his
entry
all
had
fallen
silent
and
all
more
or
less
openly
were
observing
him
i
missed
the
he
took
out
his
watch
a
little
after
nine
de
zuylestein
i
should
like
to
see
the
will
your
highness
go
down
now
the
prince
took
his
whip
from
bromley
and
stuck
it
in
his
boot
m
van
odyk
he
said
coughing
tell
them
i
will
ride
to
the
stadhuis
i
am
smothered
in
their
coach
and
attended
by
de
zuylestein
and
bromley
and
followed
by
several
of
his
gentlemen
the
prince
descended
the
narrow
polished
stairs
and
came
out
into
the
courtyard
it
was
a
cloudy
autumn
morning
windy
and
cold
the
brown
and
yellow
leaves
circled
the
in
shivering
crowds
and
sank
fluttering
from
the
almost
bare
branches
the
abbey
buildings
with
their
blue
and
yellow
painted
shutters
the
pointed
towers
pierced
with
irregular
windows
rose
up
distinct
and
clearly
coloured
directly
behind
them
lange
jan
towered
his
gothic
windows
bricked
up
or
furnished
with
coloured
shutters
his
bells
visible
in
his
leaden
cupola
and
crowned
with
the
weathercock
beside
the
tower
just
above
the
line
of
the
abbey
roof
rose
the
majestic
outline
of
the
body
of
the
church
one
of
the
zeeland
nobles
explained
when
this
was
the
abbey
church
highness
it
was
possible
to
reach
it
from
the
palace
through
the
cloisters
but
these
have
fallen
into
disuse
and
have
been
built
it
was
a
pleasant
dwelling
remarked
william
it
seemed
by
the
swift
look
he
swept
over
the
abbey
as
if
he
remembered
that
his
ancestors
the
counts
of
holland
had
lived
in
it
they
passed
under
the
low
entrance
arch
and
almost
immediately
to
their
right
was
the
small
side
door
of
the
church
it
was
open
william
uncovered
and
entered
about
the
door
was
the
square
wooden
railing
its
gate
locked
during
service
so
that
the
devout
might
not
be
disturbed
and
the
be
pilloried
in
the
public
eye
forced
to
remain
standing
like
sheep
in
a
pen
now
however
the
gate
stood
open
and
william
resting
his
hand
on
it
looked
round
he
was
under
the
tower
and
the
organ
sideways
to
the
length
of
the
building
and
facing
the
pulpit
magnificent
in
line
and
proportion
and
of
a
noble
magnitude
the
great
church
gave
an
instant
and
chilling
impression
of
bareness
and
coldness
the
reformation
had
let
the
light
into
this
and
many
another
once
dim
and
gorgeous
temple
of
the
old
faith
the
jewelled
colours
had
gone
from
the
arched
windows
and
clear
glass
took
their
place
precious
marbles
gold
and
silver
vessels
tapestries
and
paintings
had
gone
also
and
walls
and
roof
were
whitewashed
from
top
to
bottom
in
the
daylight
glaring
in
on
them
from
the
unshaded
windows
they
gave
a
desolate
effect
of
dreary
immensity
the
huge
pillars
set
in
double
rows
were
whitewashed
too
in
parts
on
their
granite
bases
it
had
worn
off
and
showed
the
stone
beneath
monuments
saints
shrines
and
carvings
had
been
torn
from
the
walls
and
unbroken
panelling
of
plain
wood
covered
the
places
that
knew
them
no
more
there
was
no
altar
where
it
had
been
stood
a
bare
and
open
space
heavy
stiff
and
narrow
pews
filled
the
nave
and
under
the
severe
pulpit
the
seats
of
the
elders
rose
in
tiers
each
with
a
bible
before
it
out
of
which
hung
a
long
green
marker
william
leant
heavily
on
the
gate
and
gazed
at
the
spot
where
opposite
to
him
two
monuments
broke
the
white
expanse
of
wall
they
were
the
tablets
in
black
to
the
memory
of
william
king
of
holland
and
his
brother
floris
above
them
an
inscription
told
how
the
latter
had
died
and
been
buried
here
in
middelburg
the
king
s
tablet
bore
a
simple
carving
of
a
mantle
a
wreath
with
a
sword
through
it
a
crowned
helmet
a
globe
in
the
niche
above
the
name
of
floris
were
helmet
mantle
and
sword
only
william
did
not
even
glance
at
the
only
other
monument
the
church
contained
that
to
the
brothers
van
evertzen
which
was
still
in
course
of
erection
the
staunch
republican
heroes
had
not
so
much
interest
for
the
young
prince
as
the
simple
record
of
these
rulers
of
holland
he
stood
so
still
the
gentlemen
behind
him
thought
that
he
must
be
praying
they
could
not
see
his
face
only
his
slight
figure
leaning
against
the
railing
the
bright
hair
on
his
shoulders
and
his
slack
hand
holding
the
beaver
whose
drooping
plume
touched
the
ground
suddenly
he
turned
and
there
was
a
faint
colour
in
his
face
you
have
a
fine
church
mynheer
he
addressed
the
zeeland
nobleman
in
a
low
voice
i
should
wish
to
be
here
on
they
passed
out
of
the
cold
light
of
the
church
into
the
sunless
grey
of
the
morning
air
van
odyk
came
to
meet
them
the
deputies
were
waiting
to
conduct
his
highness
to
the
stadhuis
his
highness
did
not
hurry
himself
for
this
but
came
leisurely
across
the
courtyard
among
those
waiting
round
the
abbey
door
was
one
he
recognised
he
stopped
m
van
mander
he
said
florent
coloured
hotly
those
standing
near
fell
back
as
the
prince
spoke
i
have
come
to
join
your
highness
service
said
van
mander
awkwardly
the
prince
s
compelling
eyes
fixed
themselves
on
him
with
a
look
of
power
of
daring
and
mastery
of
that
made
the
blood
of
the
man
who
caught
it
leap
as
if
in
answer
to
some
rousing
summons
you
may
stay
if
you
will
was
all
william
said
as
he
passed
into
the
abbey
florent
van
mander
flushed
with
pleasure
his
poor
offer
was
at
least
not
refused
yet
he
asked
himself
why
he
was
so
elated
at
changing
from
the
employ
of
de
witt
to
the
service
of
a
pretender
embarked
on
a
difficult
enterprise
he
did
not
know
but
he
did
know
that
he
would
rather
be
a
in
the
prince
s
train
than
confidential
clerk
to
de
witt
and
that
that
one
glance
from
william
was
more
to
him
than
all
the
grand
pensionary
s
gentle
goodness
the
courtyard
filled
with
people
on
horseback
and
on
foot
most
of
them
wore
orange
ribbons
in
their
coats
and
most
took
off
their
hats
when
the
prince
came
out
of
the
abbey
attended
by
the
burgher
councillors
in
their
robes
and
chains
of
office
william
preceded
them
covered
as
florent
was
quick
to
remark
and
with
the
same
ceremony
as
if
he
already
held
his
father
s
offices
he
mounted
the
black
horse
waiting
for
him
and
from
the
saddle
looked
round
the
crowded
courtyard
he
was
already
one
of
the
finest
riders
in
the
netherlands
graceful
and
fearless
and
able
to
manage
the
fiercest
horse
after
a
fashion
strange
in
one
of
his
frail
appearance
this
was
no
valueless
asset
in
the
eyes
of
men
such
as
de
zuylestein
who
regretted
the
delicate
health
and
reserved
demeanour
of
one
who
must
rely
on
popularity
for
his
advancement
his
fine
horsemanship
was
the
one
showy
thing
about
the
prince
and
on
the
rare
occasions
when
he
had
displayed
himself
to
the
people
it
had
not
failed
of
its
effect
bromley
adding
later
to
his
letter
to
her
highness
the
impetuous
intriguing
princess
dowager
had
great
things
to
say
of
the
prince
s
progress
to
the
stadhuis
that
morning
he
rode
through
the
streets
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
wrote
the
englishman
smiling
a
little
this
way
and
that
all
the
maids
must
wear
orange
ribbons
and
all
the
men
look
out
their
swords
zeeland
at
least
is
tired
of
de
witt
we
want
a
soldier
a
prince
i
hear
on
all
sides
they
go
mad
for
him
de
zuylestein
feared
that
he
was
not
open
enough
with
the
people
but
it
is
not
necessary
for
his
highness
to
make
himself
beloved
since
he
is
so
already
and
his
demeanour
hath
pleased
every
one
i
had
not
believed
this
city
to
be
so
large
and
prosperous
until
i
saw
the
crowds
of
people
filling
the
streets
the
windows
and
the
roofs
here
however
bromley
s
information
came
to
a
stop
for
the
prince
s
suite
remained
outside
the
council
chamber
only
de
zuylestein
and
van
odyk
entering
with
him
the
representatives
of
the
six
towns
and
the
nobles
of
zeeland
were
assembled
to
meet
him
at
his
entry
they
rose
as
one
man
for
a
breath
or
two
william
remained
in
the
doorway
gazing
at
them
as
if
hesitating
what
to
do
the
chamber
was
low
and
hushed
not
very
large
the
walls
of
stone
the
ceiling
of
heavy
dark
wood
the
window
opposite
the
door
looked
on
to
the
street
and
bore
in
the
centre
of
each
lozenge
the
lion
of
zeeland
rising
rampant
from
the
waves
a
fire
burnt
on
the
tiled
hearth
and
in
the
centre
of
the
room
was
placed
the
large
table
covered
with
a
plain
green
cloth
about
which
the
deputies
sat
at
the
desks
in
the
window
recesses
were
placed
a
couple
of
clerks
their
quills
and
folios
before
them
the
sole
colour
and
brightness
in
the
whole
chamber
was
the
effect
of
the
chains
of
gold
worn
over
the
sombre
gowns
and
white
collars
of
the
councillors
at
the
head
of
the
table
stood
a
velvet
the
deputies
who
had
conducted
the
prince
requested
him
to
seat
himself
there
and
assume
the
presidency
of
the
assembly
each
member
took
then
his
own
place
william
sat
down
covered
and
began
to
pull
off
his
gloves
loosening
the
fingers
slowly
one
by
one
his
eyes
cast
down
he
was
younger
by
twenty
years
than
the
youngest
there
and
despite
his
gravity
looked
but
the
boy
he
was
in
contrast
with
the
weighty
men
about
him
de
zuylestein
glancing
at
him
felt
his
heart
sink
too
much
had
been
thrust
on
to
the
shoulders
of
seventeen
he
looked
across
the
table
at
van
odyk
and
in
his
eyes
saw
the
same
uneasiness
the
deputy
of
the
city
of
middelburg
rose
in
his
place
and
turned
towards
the
prince
he
was
a
man
pompous
and
his
even
official
voice
fell
on
a
contained
stillness
he
offered
the
presidency
of
this
meeting
to
the
prince
of
orange
thanked
him
for
coming
to
middelburg
in
person
to
accept
the
dignity
of
premier
noble
of
zeeland
which
the
speaker
reminded
him
was
his
by
right
as
well
as
by
the
will
of
the
people
professed
the
greatest
loyalty
to
his
interests
and
ended
with
an
only
allusion
to
zeeland
s
readiness
to
go
yet
further
lengths
on
his
behalf
he
sat
down
there
was
a
pause
every
one
was
looking
at
the
prince
de
zuylestein
felt
uneasy
he
knew
how
much
william
had
dared
to
be
there
and
what
this
enterprise
meant
to
him
and
the
youth
s
perfect
seemed
to
him
unnatural
he
did
not
know
what
this
boy
was
going
to
say
he
feared
both
that
it
might
be
too
bold
and
not
bold
enough
william
laid
his
tasselled
gloves
on
the
table
and
rose
it
seemed
as
if
the
hushed
assembly
became
yet
more
utterly
still
the
prince
s
face
was
shaded
by
his
hat
but
van
odyk
a
sympathetic
observer
saw
it
was
nearly
as
colourless
as
the
lace
round
his
throat
he
rested
his
hand
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
and
the
light
was
caught
in
his
square
green
ring
and
in
the
silver
buttons
on
his
cuff
de
zuylestein
leant
back
he
could
not
but
feel
anxious
this
was
the
first
time
that
the
prince
had
in
any
way
expressed
his
opinions
or
in
any
way
spoken
in
public
it
was
the
first
hint
of
his
own
attitude
as
yet
given
to
his
partisans
he
had
neither
paper
nor
note
to
help
him
even
van
odyk
had
no
idea
what
he
was
going
to
say
with
his
low
slow
utterance
william
began
fixing
his
brilliant
eyes
on
the
faces
of
the
councillors
of
zeeland
i
thank
you
for
your
speech
mynheer
van
huybert
and
you
for
your
loyalty
my
lords
and
gentlemen
of
zeeland
a
loyalty
which
you
have
maintained
towards
me
since
the
day
of
my
birth
and
which
no
evil
example
nor
evil
fortune
has
caused
to
falter
you
have
done
more
than
honour
me
within
the
limits
of
your
own
state
you
have
had
the
courage
to
give
the
signal
that
the
united
provinces
he
paused
as
if
to
let
the
open
daring
of
his
last
sentence
have
its
full
effect
with
the
effort
of
speaking
his
pallor
had
disappeared
under
a
faint
blush
he
was
breathing
a
trifle
heavily
if
i
had
delayed
taking
possession
of
my
office
i
should
have
considered
myself
lacking
in
respect
to
your
wishes
it
is
not
in
my
nature
to
consider
obstacles
nor
to
wait
on
circumstance
i
consider
that
the
time
has
come
for
me
to
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
my
he
paused
again
and
took
off
his
hat
so
that
the
light
streaming
in
through
the
windows
at
his
left
fell
full
upon
his
face
his
princely
features
framed
in
the
bright
waves
of
his
heavy
hair
flushed
deeper
with
the
emotion
shining
in
his
intense
eyes
i
shall
never
forget
the
honour
that
you
have
done
me
i
do
not
think
that
you
will
find
me
unworthy
of
the
confidence
of
zeeland
i
look
about
me
on
perilous
times
i
see
that
there
is
much
to
do
for
the
preservation
of
the
united
provinces
and
the
reformed
religion
but
it
has
never
been
the
habit
of
my
house
to
find
any
sacrifice
too
great
in
the
service
of
god
and
to
whatever
duty
he
be
pleased
to
call
me
i
shall
be
his
glance
flashed
from
one
face
to
another
suddenly
he
smiled
gentlemen
you
know
the
motto
of
my
house
i
will
he
put
on
his
hat
and
sat
down
the
speech
was
a
manifesto
an
old
statesman
could
have
framed
nothing
that
could
have
pleased
the
people
better
van
odyk
relieved
and
satisfied
pictured
the
effect
of
his
highness
words
printed
by
the
thousand
and
scattered
up
and
down
the
country
the
silence
seemed
to
thrill
and
gather
the
deputies
moved
looked
at
each
other
nodded
and
smiled
with
narrowed
eyes
hidden
excitement
flushed
every
face
the
burgomaster
of
middelburg
van
huybert
again
rose
in
the
name
of
zeeland
we
thank
your
behind
the
words
was
more
than
any
words
or
any
action
could
express
deep
loyalty
to
the
ancient
house
blind
enthusiasm
for
the
ancient
glories
unquestioning
belief
in
the
descendant
of
the
man
who
had
given
the
netherlands
their
freedom
william
saluted
them
recommended
the
lord
of
beverwaert
to
their
notice
as
his
deputy
and
left
the
chamber
when
his
suite
had
reached
the
markt
and
william
was
remounted
his
gentlemen
crowded
about
him
with
congratulations
the
men
and
women
who
had
come
from
all
parts
of
the
island
to
see
him
dressed
in
their
neat
native
costume
black
with
the
gold
and
coral
ornaments
the
burgher
companies
on
horseback
the
pikemen
on
foot
the
shopkeepers
in
their
best
pressed
round
the
cavalcade
almost
impeding
its
progress
in
their
eagerness
to
catch
sight
of
william
of
orange
william
glanced
back
at
the
stately
stadhuis
with
its
statues
of
the
counts
of
holland
and
their
ladies
under
the
delicate
carved
canopies
standing
between
each
window
at
the
pointed
roof
pierced
with
little
gabled
windows
behind
blue
shutters
painted
with
white
in
the
shape
of
a
curtain
drawn
to
a
waist
at
the
gothic
tower
with
its
leaden
dome
and
clock
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
fix
the
place
on
his
mind
a
pale
beam
of
sun
broke
through
the
clouds
and
rested
on
the
building
it
is
done
said
the
lord
of
beverwaert
in
easy
elation
william
of
orange
gathered
up
his
reins
and
turned
his
horse
in
the
direction
of
the
abbey
of
nicolas
mynheer
it
is
begun
he
answered
chapter
viii
de
witt
and
his
highness
where
is
the
prince
now
asked
cornelius
de
witt
at
honsholredyck
once
his
mother
s
house
he
will
not
return
directly
to
the
hague
for
fear
of
my
the
grand
pensionary
stood
at
the
window
of
his
residence
in
the
kneuterdyk
avenue
and
looked
as
he
spoke
out
at
the
colourless
afternoon
but
this
will
bring
him
replied
the
ruard
grimly
he
referred
to
the
skilful
measure
his
brother
had
taken
on
receiving
the
news
from
zeeland
the
grand
pensionary
had
forced
the
assembly
to
pass
a
law
forbidding
individual
provinces
to
reinstate
the
stadtholdership
without
the
sanction
of
the
other
states
and
confirming
de
montbas
in
his
appointment
as
captain
general
maybe
he
hath
discovered
a
stubborn
disposition
that
makes
it
difficult
to
know
what
he
will
do
he
hath
sent
his
valet
to
professor
bornius
and
de
chapuygeau
dispensing
with
their
this
is
impudence
frowned
cornelius
he
hath
no
right
to
dismiss
his
tutors
when
he
is
under
your
he
had
no
right
to
go
to
zeeland
returned
john
de
witt
moving
from
the
window
nor
any
right
to
deceive
me
with
intent
to
rouse
dissension
in
the
state
but
since
he
had
the
will
and
the
power
what
avails
our
talk
of
right
cornelius
leant
forward
from
his
chair
and
stared
thoughtfully
into
the
fire
the
pleasant
glow
of
the
burning
logs
played
over
his
face
his
handsome
grey
silk
dress
braided
in
gold
his
embroidered
baldric
his
high
boots
and
massive
he
was
a
large
and
weighty
man
of
a
demeanour
more
passionate
and
impatient
than
his
brother
you
must
remember
i
always
distrusted
this
pupil
of
yours
he
said
slowly
have
we
not
had
enough
difficulty
at
home
and
abroad
that
you
must
nurse
this
viper
to
sting
you
on
your
own
hearth
john
de
witt
moved
to
the
other
side
of
the
fireplace
he
is
very
the
ruard
glanced
up
ah
still
you
make
excuses
for
i
endeavour
to
be
just
brother
answered
the
grand
pensionary
this
young
man
hath
fooled
me
i
confess
it
i
have
done
all
in
my
power
to
prevent
this
mistake
of
mine
proving
of
danger
to
the
state
do
not
imagine
that
i
reproach
you
put
in
cornelius
quickly
his
brother
faintly
smiled
it
may
be
that
i
wish
to
justify
myself
a
statesman
should
not
be
so
easily
deceived
and
by
a
child
i
thought
i
could
rely
on
those
i
had
placed
about
him
i
did
not
know
he
was
in
communication
with
de
all
which
shows
that
he
is
cleverer
than
we
why
do
you
speak
of
his
youth
since
he
has
belied
it
with
his
wisdom
asked
cornelius
warmly
i
thought
not
of
wisdom
or
cleverness
replied
the
grand
pensionary
half
mournfully
but
of
what
his
character
might
be
what
honour
strength
or
nobility
he
may
possess
i
have
taken
some
pains
with
his
teaching
he
hath
been
educated
as
a
christian
a
dutchman
a
gentleman
i
can
not
believe
my
labour
has
been
in
vain
not
he
seeks
his
father
s
power
and
less
will
not
satisfy
him
said
the
ruard
and
as
every
magistrate
in
holland
hath
sworn
to
the
perpetual
edict
of
the
abdication
of
his
house
what
is
there
before
us
if
he
grows
in
strength
his
hopes
can
not
be
so
presumptuous
answered
john
de
witt
sternly
if
they
are
we
must
check
them
i
have
regained
the
princess
dowager
through
her
fears
and
her
she
hath
no
influence
with
him
he
owns
no
counsellor
but
his
pride
he
attended
the
review
of
the
troops
at
breda
against
my
he
went
to
flaunt
still
at
the
officers
banquet
they
placed
him
below
de
montbas
and
he
would
not
take
his
seat
nor
call
upon
de
montbas
so
his
ambition
brings
humiliation
on
him
we
gained
by
that
show
of
no
concessions
said
the
ruard
no
concessions
his
party
become
incredibly
bold
we
have
been
driven
to
order
out
the
at
dordt
to
check
the
it
is
a
marvellous
thing
that
they
should
clamour
for
him
mused
john
de
witt
turning
his
dark
sad
eyes
on
his
brother
what
can
they
know
of
him
that
they
should
love
him
so
the
base
crowd
care
not
about
his
qualities
replied
the
ruard
they
but
seek
an
excuse
for
disorder
and
lawlessness
did
you
hear
vivien
in
the
assembly
cornelius
de
witt
laughed
angrily
he
was
cutting
a
book
with
a
steel
knife
i
sitting
next
him
asked
what
he
was
about
trying
the
effect
of
steel
on
parchment
he
said
meaning
that
once
there
was
a
sword
in
the
prince
of
orange
s
hand
there
would
be
an
end
of
the
perpetual
john
de
witt
was
silent
and
his
brother
rose
if
i
am
to
return
to
dordt
i
must
take
my
the
grand
pensionary
roused
himself
from
absorbed
thoughts
he
asked
after
his
brother
s
wife
and
his
own
children
do
you
see
them
often
almost
every
i
have
put
a
bible
for
agneta
in
your
portmantle
it
is
large
print
that
she
may
read
it
while
at
her
she
is
a
good
a
radiant
look
came
into
john
de
witt
s
eyes
i
can
hardly
bring
myself
to
do
without
such
precious
company
but
they
are
better
with
my
sister
this
house
is
too
quiet
and
i
so
seldom
both
were
silent
thinking
of
wendela
de
witt
regrets
were
not
in
their
religion
believing
they
could
not
repine
the
firelight
showing
more
strongly
as
the
grey
day
faded
warmed
the
sombre
dark
room
into
a
more
cheerful
aspect
glittering
redly
in
the
brass
fireirons
and
bellows
the
nails
in
the
leather
chairs
the
ruard
s
embroidered
dress
and
showing
too
the
grand
pensionary
s
tall
and
stately
figure
in
his
quiet
black
with
the
plain
linen
collar
tied
with
silk
tassels
and
the
brown
hair
falling
either
side
the
melancholy
composed
face
there
was
a
great
likeness
between
the
two
brothers
though
cornelius
was
of
a
larger
make
a
freer
carriage
haughtier
perhaps
and
more
fiery
but
with
a
glance
as
dignified
and
a
bearing
as
noble
since
you
must
go
john
de
witt
was
saying
when
van
ouvenaller
opened
the
door
mynheer
his
highness
the
prince
of
the
brothers
exchanged
a
quick
glance
he
is
here
in
the
library
alone
he
rode
up
with
one
of
his
gentlemen
mynheer
who
remains
with
the
john
de
witt
laid
his
hand
on
his
brother
s
sleeve
desire
the
prince
to
come
in
here
if
he
wishes
to
see
me
van
when
the
secretary
had
gone
the
ruard
spoke
you
did
not
know
he
was
at
the
hague
no
he
must
have
ridden
from
honsholredyck
what
does
this
move
mean
the
grand
pensionary
s
lips
were
sternly
set
his
brows
slightly
frowning
i
do
not
know
he
hath
heard
of
what
passed
in
the
assembly
will
you
stay
nay
he
would
not
speak
before
me
we
never
loved
one
he
must
speak
before
whomsoever
i
choose
to
question
him
since
he
is
still
under
my
tutelage
answered
john
de
witt
sternly
yet
i
will
not
remain
lest
your
patience
and
his
presumption
should
anger
van
ouvenaller
entered
again
announcing
the
prince
who
followed
him
the
secretary
withdrew
closing
the
door
and
william
of
orange
stood
facing
the
brothers
he
was
in
riding
costume
and
wore
over
it
a
dark
velvet
mantle
his
whip
was
in
his
boot
he
carried
his
gloves
and
his
hat
in
his
right
hand
purposely
to
cover
the
fact
that
he
did
not
offer
it
to
de
witt
there
was
a
colour
in
his
face
and
his
bright
hair
was
tumbled
over
his
falling
lace
collar
he
had
ridden
a
long
way
in
a
keen
wind
i
am
glad
that
your
highness
hath
seen
fit
to
return
to
the
hague
said
de
witt
he
also
did
not
offer
his
hand
i
was
ill
at
honsholredyck
mynheer
answered
william
good
day
mynheer
the
and
he
fixed
his
eyes
with
a
daring
expression
of
haughty
dislike
on
cornelius
de
witt
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
in
the
grand
pensionary
s
brother
there
was
a
staunch
and
fearless
republican
an
enemy
of
his
house
with
distrust
of
him
far
keener
than
john
de
witt
s
but
more
than
this
william
disliked
the
ruard
because
he
felt
in
him
some
one
who
read
him
better
than
any
other
man
had
cornelius
been
in
his
brother
s
place
william
would
never
have
escaped
to
middelburg
the
ruard
returned
the
prince
s
salute
very
coldly
i
hope
your
highness
hath
recovered
your
health
sufficiently
to
enable
you
to
resume
your
what
are
my
duties
asked
william
looking
at
him
under
drooping
lids
i
thought
it
was
my
misfortune
to
have
none
your
duties
are
your
studies
replied
cornelius
sternly
and
obedience
to
de
the
prince
slightly
smiled
his
glance
flickered
from
one
man
to
the
other
john
de
witt
not
at
all
and
cornelius
only
partially
guessed
at
the
implacable
resentment
hidden
behind
his
impassive
exterior
and
neither
knew
that
the
ruard
s
remark
was
one
more
added
to
those
things
the
prince
would
never
forgive
it
is
with
de
witt
i
wish
to
speak
he
said
i
shall
not
disturb
your
but
john
de
witt
interposed
my
brother
is
in
the
entire
confidence
of
the
states
highness
and
you
may
say
what
you
have
come
to
say
before
mynheer
the
ruard
may
be
in
your
confidence
de
witt
replied
william
still
with
a
slight
smile
but
he
is
not
in
cornelius
took
up
his
plumed
hat
and
bowed
proudly
to
the
prince
good
day
your
highness
good
day
william
gave
him
as
careless
a
salute
as
he
dared
and
turned
his
back
as
the
ruard
closed
the
door
john
de
witt
s
just
indignation
was
not
softened
by
this
haughtiness
what
is
the
object
of
this
visit
he
demanded
after
keeping
me
entirely
ignorant
of
your
movements
why
do
you
come
to
my
house
in
this
informal
way
they
both
remained
standing
the
prince
with
his
hand
resting
on
the
little
oak
table
beside
him
i
wrote
to
you
mynheer
from
vlaardingen
to
tell
you
that
the
princess
and
the
elector
had
declared
me
of
age
they
have
notified
this
to
the
william
spoke
quietly
looking
down
therefore
i
do
not
consider
it
necessary
to
give
an
account
of
my
actions
to
any
neither
the
princess
nor
the
elector
are
your
guardians
but
the
states
replied
the
grand
pensionary
sternly
and
their
high
mightinesses
have
fixed
your
majority
in
another
four
years
until
then
i
representing
them
am
responsible
for
your
education
and
your
behaviour
it
seems
highness
that
you
will
make
my
task
william
moved
to
the
fire
and
seated
himself
in
the
chair
the
ruard
had
occupied
it
was
not
lost
on
de
witt
that
he
did
so
easily
without
invitation
as
if
in
his
own
house
by
going
to
middelburg
you
have
placed
yourself
at
the
head
of
the
malcontents
continued
de
witt
and
taken
upon
yourself
the
dangerous
and
troublesome
part
of
a
nay
mynheer
william
glanced
up
i
pretend
to
nothing
i
went
to
middelburg
to
enter
upon
an
office
mine
by
you
had
not
the
sanction
of
the
mynheer
i
was
within
the
law
the
law
of
the
republic
answered
the
prince
the
state
of
zeeland
invited
me
and
i
saw
no
reason
to
refuse
if
their
high
mightinesses
consider
zeeland
did
amiss
it
is
a
matter
for
the
the
grand
pensionary
seated
himself
the
other
side
of
the
hearth
and
fixed
his
deep
eyes
on
the
prince
s
composed
face
you
did
a
daring
thing
an
thing
and
i
think
a
dishonourable
thing
he
said
william
blushed
hotly
at
that
last
epithet
and
for
once
the
effort
at
control
showed
he
was
silent
because
he
did
not
trust
himself
to
speak
i
put
before
you
continued
john
de
witt
the
state
of
the
country
i
asked
you
to
dissociate
yourself
from
the
faction
that
used
your
name
you
evaded
my
frankness
you
deceived
my
trust
while
you
assumed
docility
you
were
planning
to
raise
the
standard
of
revolt
while
i
was
teaching
you
your
duty
to
god
and
your
country
you
were
secretly
nursing
selfish
ambitious
and
dangerous
designs
in
a
word
he
made
a
disdainful
gesture
with
his
hand
you
deceived
the
prince
made
a
movement
that
tossed
his
violet
mantle
back
from
his
shoulders
i
have
never
given
you
my
word
on
any
matter
on
which
i
have
broken
it
he
said
in
a
low
voice
nor
used
fair
speeches
my
behaviour
has
been
what
you
might
have
looked
for
from
a
state
prisoner
i
have
said
i
am
grateful
to
you
for
your
care
de
witt
i
repeat
it
you
have
my
duty
and
my
what
duty
or
friendship
was
it
that
played
this
stroke
asked
the
grand
pensionary
william
raised
his
brilliant
eyes
i
was
within
the
law
mynheer
that
i
went
to
claim
my
father
s
private
titles
has
nothing
to
do
with
affairs
of
your
visit
had
a
political
who
has
so
represented
it
to
you
any
lord
visiting
his
fief
would
receive
the
welcome
zeeland
gave
me
i
could
not
imagine
that
the
friendliness
of
people
long
devoted
to
my
house
could
cause
uneasiness
to
the
their
eyes
met
but
nothing
was
expressed
in
william
s
steady
glance
that
de
witt
could
read
his
words
by
not
uneasiness
to
the
government
highness
answered
the
grand
pensionary
quietly
for
that
is
strong
enough
to
quell
whatever
dissatisfaction
your
action
may
have
raised
but
uneasiness
to
me
who
have
your
welfare
at
heart
i
had
hoped
to
accomplish
as
your
friend
what
i
may
now
have
to
perform
as
your
the
prince
looked
into
the
fire
the
lace
on
his
breast
was
rising
and
falling
quickly
with
his
breathing
and
his
reddish
arched
brows
were
raised
slightly
john
de
witt
marvelled
in
his
heart
at
this
youth
s
control
he
was
a
little
baffled
by
it
his
desire
was
to
take
william
s
manner
for
sincerity
experience
and
the
counsels
of
cornelius
warned
him
that
it
might
very
well
be
diplomacy
himself
he
was
using
the
one
weapon
he
had
used
all
his
life
a
noble
simple
honesty
of
purpose
and
of
speech
you
have
heard
what
has
taken
place
in
the
assembly
he
asked
yes
william
drew
out
his
laced
handkerchief
and
pressed
it
to
his
lips
it
is
concerning
the
measures
lately
passed
in
the
assembly
that
i
wished
to
speak
to
they
could
not
please
you
said
de
witt
half
mournfully
but
you
forced
the
prince
coughed
it
seems
you
think
me
dangerous
mynheer
john
de
witt
answered
him
directly
i
think
the
position
you
might
assume
would
be
william
lifted
suddenly
smiling
eyes
were
not
my
hopes
of
dominion
effectually
foiled
by
the
perpetual
edict
mynheer
that
you
needed
other
laws
to
strengthen
your
power
not
my
power
replied
de
witt
but
the
safety
of
the
william
pushed
back
the
hair
from
his
low
forehead
ah
you
credit
me
with
ambitions
am
i
not
sufficiently
helpless
do
you
think
i
should
intrigue
for
the
mastery
of
the
seven
provinces
i
who
am
heir
to
nothing
he
gave
a
little
smile
half
bitter
you
need
not
have
taken
these
precautions
de
of
what
does
your
highness
complain
asked
the
grand
pensionary
william
answered
with
a
flash
of
repressed
feeling
their
high
mightinesses
engaged
to
give
me
the
captain
generalship
when
i
came
of
age
and
it
has
been
placed
in
the
hands
of
de
you
are
not
yet
of
age
highness
youth
and
inexperience
must
wait
and
learn
de
montbas
is
a
good
soldier
and
the
states
have
confidence
in
the
prince
s
hand
closed
tightly
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
and
i
had
your
promise
mynheer
to
obtain
for
me
a
seat
in
the
council
of
state
yet
i
hear
you
oppose
my
election
by
your
action
in
middelburg
you
have
forfeited
my
favour
in
this
matter
replied
de
witt
and
i
am
william
bit
his
lip
you
have
seen
the
princess
dowager
he
said
and
won
her
to
my
views
for
what
are
your
views
mynheer
i
have
told
her
highness
that
the
states
will
not
be
forced
by
premature
intrigues
you
merely
endanger
the
goodwill
of
the
republic
on
which
rest
all
your
the
prince
gave
him
a
keen
look
so
you
will
oppose
me
in
the
assembly
he
asked
rather
breathlessly
i
shall
oppose
your
election
into
the
council
of
state
highness
at
least
till
you
are
of
and
your
reason
mynheer
my
reason
replied
the
grand
pensionary
gravely
is
that
i
am
the
servant
of
this
republic
and
sworn
to
maintain
it
in
its
integrity
therefore
i
can
not
put
so
much
power
into
the
hands
of
one
who
has
nothing
save
his
birth
as
a
qualification
i
am
not
blind
to
your
abilities
highness
but
you
are
too
young
and
have
just
given
proof
you
may
be
too
william
made
a
little
movement
in
his
chair
and
the
captain
generalship
he
asked
on
that
point
the
states
are
adamant
it
remains
in
the
hands
of
de
montbas
until
you
are
of
age
at
there
was
a
second
s
pause
while
william
strove
to
contain
himself
when
he
spoke
it
was
in
a
low
voice
i
am
sorry
to
have
incurred
your
enmity
not
my
enmity
returned
de
witt
with
feeling
there
you
mistake
me
you
yourself
assure
me
of
your
opposition
to
my
claims
said
the
prince
you
yourself
tell
me
that
you
have
withdrawn
your
promise
in
the
matter
of
the
council
of
and
i
have
told
you
why
because
i
uphold
this
republic
because
i
must
serve
what
i
have
sworn
to
serve
because
i
can
not
on
my
conscience
sacrifice
the
liberty
of
many
to
the
aggrandisement
of
one
because
i
am
opposed
to
princely
power
but
this
does
not
leave
me
highness
the
less
your
william
was
silent
the
shadows
had
so
encroached
on
them
that
they
could
hardly
see
each
other
de
witt
himself
lit
the
candles
and
placed
them
on
the
mantelshelf
where
they
were
reflected
in
the
mirror
as
the
steady
light
filled
the
chamber
the
grand
pensionary
looked
down
at
the
prince
do
you
not
understand
he
said
my
position
what
i
must
and
what
i
shall
do
i
understand
answered
william
what
i
can
not
do
i
have
angered
you
john
de
witt
spoke
gently
it
is
against
my
will
i
would
serve
you
any
way
i
could
i
would
forget
the
unruly
spirit
you
have
shown
is
it
not
possible
there
might
yet
be
confidence
between
us
the
prince
replied
as
abruptly
as
irrelevantly
mynheer
was
it
by
your
commands
i
was
slighted
at
breda
john
de
witt
s
face
hardened
i
know
of
no
slight
highness
it
was
you
who
treated
the
officers
with
contempt
when
you
refused
to
sit
down
to
table
with
by
your
desire
i
was
placed
below
de
montbas
yes
by
my
desire
answered
de
witt
firmly
why
do
you
refer
to
this
incident
highness
it
was
against
my
wish
that
you
went
to
the
camp
and
in
the
matter
of
the
banquet
you
behaved
there
was
no
gentleman
there
as
there
is
no
gentleman
in
the
united
provinces
above
me
in
rank
said
the
prince
and
a
barely
contained
pride
was
in
his
eyes
and
voice
m
de
montbas
is
above
you
as
the
representative
of
the
republic
and
the
head
of
the
army
again
william
bit
his
lip
with
the
effort
of
keeping
back
the
passion
in
his
soul
he
flushed
and
quivered
fixing
his
eyes
that
he
knew
often
betrayed
him
on
the
fire
very
well
mynheer
i
shall
remember
your
wish
or
the
desire
of
the
law
whichever
i
must
call
at
the
slightest
touch
of
submission
john
de
witt
always
softened
instantly
he
crossed
the
hearth
came
behind
william
s
chair
and
laid
his
hand
affectionately
on
the
youth
s
shoulder
it
is
difficult
to
be
a
prince
in
a
republic
you
have
in
many
ways
a
hard
heritage
believe
me
i
have
always
understood
it
we
owe
your
house
too
much
of
all
things
i
detest
i
have
seen
nobility
in
you
too
you
will
be
worthy
of
your
the
prince
whose
perfect
insight
and
tact
had
already
assured
him
that
he
would
obtain
no
concessions
from
the
grand
pensionary
controlled
himself
to
a
soft
answer
this
further
puts
me
in
your
debt
de
witt
he
said
and
rose
holding
the
mantle
on
his
breast
you
will
not
find
me
ungrateful
if
i
have
troubled
you
you
must
forgive
this
graceful
surrender
surprised
and
touched
de
witt
indeed
i
have
been
ill
continued
william
or
i
had
written
to
you
but
since
i
could
not
with
my
own
hand
i
was
loath
to
send
you
a
letter
by
a
i
am
sorry
for
your
ill
health
said
de
witt
sincerely
and
glad
that
you
are
i
trust
you
will
never
find
me
otherwise
all
trace
of
had
vanished
from
the
prince
s
manner
he
could
when
he
chose
be
charming
very
few
could
resist
him
when
he
unbent
certainly
not
john
de
witt
we
will
take
up
our
interrupted
studies
highness
and
i
will
overlook
an
indiscretion
as
you
must
overlook
some
necessary
harshness
he
smiled
do
not
recall
bornius
and
de
chapuygeau
pleaded
william
frankly
mynheer
i
know
all
they
can
teach
me
huggens
van
ghent
and
yourself
are
sufficient
tutors
for
me
nay
you
will
do
me
this
favour
not
to
put
over
me
men
whom
i
john
de
witt
was
still
smiling
you
had
no
right
to
dismiss
them
highness
but
to
show
my
goodwill
i
shall
obtain
this
favour
for
i
am
greatly
obliged
to
you
william
was
thanking
him
flattering
him
with
his
marvellous
eyes
his
low
voice
and
grateful
carriage
will
you
honour
me
with
a
visit
mynheer
he
asked
with
an
air
of
courteous
outspokenness
that
sat
charmingly
on
his
youth
i
have
left
van
odyk
in
middelburg
to
exercise
those
duties
that
will
be
mine
when
i
am
out
of
tutelage
for
the
rest
i
beg
you
will
forgive
highness
answered
john
de
witt
gravely
and
sweetly
it
is
my
mind
ever
to
spend
as
little
time
as
possible
in
looking
backwards
it
will
be
my
very
great
happiness
to
forget
everything
save
your
good
qualities
and
to
work
side
by
side
with
you
in
the
william
fixed
his
smiling
eyes
on
the
grand
pensionary
s
face
and
held
out
his
hand
thank
you
mynheer
my
actions
shall
show
me
not
de
witt
clasped
the
frail
fingers
warmly
mr
bromley
will
be
tired
of
waiting
said
the
prince
and
i
fear
i
have
already
trespassed
on
your
he
picked
up
his
hat
and
gloves
from
the
chair
by
the
fire
until
the
grand
pensionary
came
to
the
door
with
him
the
lamps
were
lit
in
the
kneuterdyk
avenue
and
the
invariable
autumn
mists
were
blowing
coldly
from
the
sea
there
will
be
skating
soon
said
william
with
a
little
shiver
bromley
walking
the
horses
up
and
down
stopped
before
the
house
at
sight
of
his
master
de
witt
and
again
thank
the
grand
pensionary
closed
the
door
and
the
prince
descended
the
steps
as
he
turned
his
back
on
de
witt
s
house
his
eyes
narrowed
as
if
he
looked
at
something
a
long
way
off
well
your
highness
asked
bromley
who
was
rather
cold
but
still
william
mounted
without
touching
the
stirrup
and
gathered
up
the
reins
he
is
iron
he
said
i
could
not
do
anything
nor
even
attempt
it
how
much
longer
he
added
in
a
sombre
passion
how
much
longer
they
trotted
the
horses
briskly
through
the
cobbled
streets
m
de
chapuygeau
and
bornius
are
not
coming
back
i
have
at
least
two
masters
the
less
remarked
the
prince
with
a
gloomy
satisfaction
i
am
glad
highness
answered
bromley
who
hated
these
two
and
van
ghent
he
stays
i
could
not
speak
against
did
de
witt
mention
his
secretary
who
came
to
join
you
at
middelburg
no
i
can
not
keep
him
in
my
service
bromley
yet
he
might
be
useful
added
the
prince
with
the
statesman
s
dislike
to
waste
good
material
well
we
will
talk
of
it
to
de
he
lapsed
into
silence
but
as
they
passed
the
stadhuis
bromley
roused
him
then
you
are
still
on
bad
terms
with
de
witt
he
suggested
wondering
what
this
interview
had
amounted
to
and
whether
the
prince
s
cause
had
been
advanced
or
no
by
this
flight
to
middelburg
and
its
results
i
am
very
good
friends
with
de
witt
answered
william
grimly
from
out
the
depths
of
his
collar
and
he
hath
forgiven
me
but
i
had
to
fawn
on
him
fawn
on
him
bromley
it
is
a
thing
not
to
be
chapter
ix
amalia
of
solms
her
highness
the
dowager
princess
of
orange
coloured
with
pleasure
hastily
put
aside
the
letter
she
was
writing
and
went
down
to
the
chamber
where
as
she
had
just
been
told
her
grandson
awaited
her
it
was
a
pouring
wet
day
and
she
had
not
been
able
to
leave
her
elegant
little
residence
to
go
into
the
garden
which
was
even
at
this
time
of
the
year
her
delight
this
had
added
to
the
weariness
and
monotony
of
her
ordinary
quiet
life
and
made
the
rare
favour
of
a
voluntary
visit
from
the
prince
the
only
member
of
her
family
left
her
and
the
person
that
she
held
dearest
in
the
world
the
more
grateful
the
princess
was
still
comely
vivacious
and
bright
as
when
prince
frederick
henry
had
married
her
forty
years
ago
she
was
dressed
with
a
richness
and
surrounded
with
a
comfort
that
her
straitened
means
made
a
marvel
to
prevent
economy
from
becoming
meanness
and
to
keep
luxury
this
side
of
extravagance
were
her
constant
almost
her
only
employments
she
opened
the
door
softly
and
gazed
at
the
prince
before
he
saw
her
the
room
looked
on
the
front
of
the
house
and
was
sumptuously
furnished
with
persian
carpets
chinese
cabinets
porcelain
ornaments
carved
settees
and
chairs
gilt
and
richly
cushioned
with
stamped
leather
and
satin
near
the
dark
red
silk
hung
a
brightly
coloured
parrot
in
an
ebony
ring
in
front
of
the
fire
slept
a
white
cat
on
a
chair
near
were
a
tambour
frame
and
a
basket
of
silks
there
was
only
one
picture
a
portrait
of
william
in
armour
holding
his
helmet
this
hung
above
the
mantelpiece
cut
deep
into
the
heavy
oak
frame
showed
the
motto
of
the
house
of
je
sera
nassau
moi
je
standing
by
the
harpsichord
that
filled
one
corner
of
the
room
the
prince
waited
he
held
his
whip
in
his
hand
and
was
frowning
thoughtfully
the
princess
stepped
into
the
chamber
and
closed
the
door
with
a
little
sound
that
made
him
turn
ah
madame
i
disturb
you
disturb
me
she
interrupted
smiling
it
is
good
of
you
to
come
and
see
a
lonely
old
he
came
forward
and
would
have
saluted
her
hand
but
she
caught
him
by
the
shoulders
and
kissed
him
on
the
brow
a
caress
he
did
her
the
honour
of
enduring
in
silence
how
cold
you
are
she
exclaimed
have
you
ridden
here
in
this
rain
it
had
been
pouring
all
day
the
question
seemed
to
william
too
foolish
to
answer
and
on
horseback
cried
the
princess
catching
sight
of
his
whip
and
wet
mantle
over
a
chair
you
know
i
can
not
endure
a
carriage
the
princess
rang
the
little
silver
bell
on
her
it
is
very
imprudent
my
dear
allow
old
age
its
liberty
in
saying
so
you
need
a
woman
to
look
after
you
these
men
would
let
you
kill
yourself
and
never
notice
it
come
to
the
fire
she
finished
with
a
pretty
air
of
command
william
obeyed
coughing
a
little
which
caused
her
to
raise
still
further
her
brows
and
shake
her
head
a
servant
made
his
appearance
remove
his
highness
mantle
and
dry
it
and
whom
have
you
brought
with
you
william
mr
bromley
and
a
see
his
highness
gentleman
is
made
comfortable
and
let
the
horses
be
looked
to
said
the
princess
the
man
bowed
low
as
he
withdrew
the
subtle
air
of
a
court
still
clung
round
amalia
of
solms
in
her
own
house
at
least
she
was
treated
as
a
sovereign
princess
william
respected
her
for
that
he
found
the
atmosphere
of
her
pleasant
residence
congenial
it
was
the
nearest
approach
to
home
that
he
had
ever
known
and
compared
with
his
dreary
palace
at
the
hague
ease
luxury
and
comfort
combined
the
princess
settled
herself
in
her
chair
i
have
not
seen
you
since
your
visit
to
middelburg
come
nearer
the
fire
sit
down
and
tell
me
all
that
she
was
a
handsome
old
lady
had
been
of
the
pretty
imperious
style
of
beauty
dark
and
flashing
as
she
leant
back
on
her
cushions
now
in
her
yellow
silk
gown
with
her
brown
eyes
under
her
white
hair
and
the
fine
lace
round
her
head
and
fastened
under
her
chin
she
was
a
beauty
still
you
know
what
occurred
at
middelburg
madame
answered
william
not
very
warmly
i
have
had
reports
letters
from
bromley
to
whom
i
am
eternally
grateful
but
from
you
nothing
william
leant
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
coughed
and
pushed
back
his
curls
his
expression
told
the
princess
that
he
was
displeased
with
her
she
had
half
expected
it
certainly
she
had
helped
concoct
her
grandson
s
journey
to
middelburg
but
she
had
immediately
thereafter
been
frightened
and
had
allowed
herself
easily
to
be
won
by
de
witt
again
to
prudence
and
william
knew
it
unfurling
a
black
and
glittering
fan
she
held
it
between
her
face
and
the
fire
while
she
gave
her
grandson
an
anxious
glance
you
are
angry
with
me
william
she
said
plaintively
you
only
came
to
see
me
because
you
wanted
to
scold
the
prince
still
looked
into
the
fire
ah
me
sighed
amalia
of
solms
i
can
never
please
you
you
have
no
more
devoted
friend
than
i
and
you
do
not
repay
me
with
the
least
regard
or
the
prince
answered
now
in
his
soft
voice
and
slow
utterance
these
reproaches
madame
are
foolish
it
is
i
who
have
the
grievance
had
you
stood
firm
once
i
found
myself
in
middelburg
i
should
find
myself
in
a
different
position
the
princess
sat
up
with
a
helpless
appealing
gesture
clasping
her
white
hands
over
her
heart
i
did
all
i
could
i
solemnly
notified
to
the
assembly
that
i
had
declared
you
of
age
i
wrote
to
prince
john
maurice
begging
him
to
join
you
he
had
not
the
courage
to
respond
further
than
interrupted
william
dryly
i
know
it
was
not
my
fault
i
thought
that
he
would
be
a
valuable
ally
for
you
again
the
prince
broke
in
i
think
of
de
witt
madame
he
came
to
you
the
moment
he
learned
you
were
at
middelburg
answered
the
princess
with
a
shiver
what
to
find
out
or
say
i
do
not
know
the
fan
fluttered
nervously
it
was
dreadful
and
you
were
frightened
you
made
not
one
my
dear
not
one
m
de
witt
warned
you
we
were
going
too
william
turned
on
her
his
masterful
eyes
he
was
angry
of
course
said
the
princess
evasively
he
told
you
my
action
had
imperilled
those
favours
already
promised
me
in
a
word
he
threatened
maybe
he
did
he
was
certainly
angry
repeated
the
princess
and
you
gave
way
not
an
inch
william
smiled
rather
bitterly
i
wish
i
could
believe
it
indeed
it
is
the
it
is
the
truth
madame
asserted
the
prince
impatiently
that
de
witt
frightened
you
into
losing
all
the
ground
we
had
gained
of
what
use
to
me
are
a
few
plaudits
in
middelburg
if
i
lose
the
seat
in
the
council
of
state
and
the
captain
generalship
you
must
not
blame
me
for
that
protested
the
princess
i
could
not
defy
de
witt
who
is
after
all
our
you
could
have
evaded
him
said
william
but
no
you
must
meet
him
and
after
declaring
me
of
age
render
us
both
foolish
by
waiving
all
discussion
as
to
my
future
until
i
am
the
age
the
state
appointed
from
the
first
de
witt
promises
his
friendship
in
four
years
time
and
for
that
you
retract
everything
indeed
no
but
the
prince
swept
aside
her
protestations
you
gave
your
consent
to
my
remaining
under
the
guardianship
of
de
witt
just
as
you
put
my
education
into
the
hands
of
the
states
when
they
made
overtures
to
you
have
never
forgiven
it
sighed
amalia
of
solms
but
it
was
always
for
your
good
that
i
acted
the
states
took
you
under
their
protection
i
could
do
nothing
for
william
fixed
his
intense
gaze
on
her
i
would
rather
have
been
brought
up
by
any
poor
pastor
at
a
florin
a
week
than
by
de
witt
you
delivered
me
into
a
prison
madame
and
now
when
i
force
the
gates
open
you
close
them
on
me
the
princess
furled
her
fan
with
a
rattle
of
the
ebony
sticks
indeed
you
wrong
me
and
hurt
me
she
was
flushed
distressed
i
did
not
dare
offend
de
witt
for
your
sake
it
is
better
for
you
to
have
him
as
a
friend
than
as
an
enemy
where
do
we
stand
if
he
turns
on
us
the
states
the
prince
rose
and
leant
against
the
mantelpiece
silencing
the
old
lady
with
the
manifest
displeasure
in
his
manner
do
not
talk
of
the
states
madame
nor
of
the
republic
he
said
with
a
disdainful
accent
the
first
are
not
in
my
way
and
the
second
is
only
a
name
it
is
de
witt
always
and
only
de
he
is
but
a
servant
of
the
government
he
the
government
retorted
william
and
the
one
man
who
upholds
it
has
he
the
suffrage
of
the
country
or
even
of
the
assembly
but
they
agree
with
him
and
obey
him
because
they
are
not
strong
enough
to
resist
i
tell
you
madame
it
is
that
one
you
dislike
him
sighed
the
princess
as
if
she
found
it
a
matter
for
regret
dislike
him
repeated
william
with
a
peculiar
intonation
he
hath
kept
me
out
of
my
birthright
all
my
life
he
and
he
alone
prevents
me
from
regaining
it
now
he
a
burgher
s
son
the
passion
he
put
into
these
last
words
startled
his
grandmother
she
gazed
at
him
mutely
opening
and
shutting
her
fan
in
her
lap
the
prince
advanced
across
the
room
twisting
his
handkerchief
in
his
fingers
it
becomes
almost
more
than
i
can
endure
he
said
breathing
hard
the
other
day
i
had
to
bring
myself
to
speak
him
fair
and
he
must
put
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
say
he
pitied
me
and
understood
understood
me
he
is
a
good
man
said
the
princess
and
of
a
noble
intelligence
i
think
that
he
desires
to
do
his
duty
by
the
prince
was
looking
not
at
her
but
at
the
portrait
of
his
father
whose
dark
eyes
seemed
to
hold
a
melancholy
yet
fiery
expression
i
think
de
witt
does
his
duty
very
well
he
answered
but
i
am
not
a
republican
to
second
him
in
it
by
what
right
does
he
think
to
bend
me
into
a
tool
to
aid
him
in
his
usurped
dominion
the
princess
eyes
followed
her
grandson
s
gaze
it
was
this
spirit
in
your
father
cost
our
house
its
heritage
she
said
half
fearfully
it
was
de
witt
william
s
eyes
gleamed
fiercely
his
plebeian
insolence
it
becomes
very
difficult
for
me
to
contain
my
father
had
father
jailed
into
loevenstein
i
would
i
had
there
and
his
stiff
brother
too
amalia
of
solms
made
a
startled
movement
hush
we
must
wait
before
we
can
speak
in
such
i
have
been
waiting
all
my
life
returned
william
bitterly
you
are
young
enough
you
can
afford
to
bide
your
the
prince
gave
her
a
strange
half
sad
look
can
i
so
afford
to
wait
madame
there
is
very
much
for
me
to
do
perhaps
not
many
years
in
which
to
do
what
do
you
mean
cried
the
princess
frightened
why
it
is
of
no
matter
he
answered
as
if
he
already
regretted
having
said
so
much
and
he
turned
away
abruptly
and
looked
out
of
the
window
at
the
rain
the
grey
sky
and
the
dripping
trees
amalia
of
solms
watched
him
the
old
fear
catching
at
her
heart
she
had
been
told
that
it
would
be
a
miracle
if
he
grew
to
manhood
as
she
had
been
assured
that
he
would
never
survive
his
infancy
she
trusted
one
prediction
would
prove
as
false
as
the
other
but
as
she
considered
his
frail
appearance
his
eyes
shadowed
with
pain
his
colourless
face
his
languid
movements
as
she
recalled
his
incessant
cough
his
perpetual
headaches
the
horrible
conviction
struck
her
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
live
long
she
had
a
vague
disquieting
sense
too
of
some
vast
ambitious
and
proud
spirit
contained
in
the
delicate
body
her
grandson
had
never
made
a
confidant
of
her
but
she
felt
he
cherished
designs
of
she
knew
not
what
magnitude
and
she
was
troubled
for
the
loneliness
he
would
not
allow
her
to
share
the
tears
came
to
her
eyes
as
she
looked
at
him
he
stood
leaning
against
the
window
frame
one
hand
on
his
hip
his
proud
and
commanding
profile
towards
her
the
low
brow
shaded
by
the
dark
hair
the
pale
mouth
firmly
set
he
wore
his
green
velvet
and
a
plain
cravat
of
frisian
needlework
he
had
no
sword
for
de
witt
held
that
none
save
a
soldier
should
go
armed
there
was
recalled
to
the
princess
amalia
the
image
of
another
young
man
as
she
had
seen
him
in
his
hunting
dress
eighteen
years
ago
the
last
stadtholder
not
much
older
than
his
son
was
now
like
him
in
features
and
in
pride
on
the
eve
he
believed
of
absolute
power
the
princess
could
remember
how
he
had
bent
his
whip
in
his
hand
and
spoken
of
these
presumptuous
burghers
a
week
afterwards
he
lay
dead
of
the
smallpox
in
guelders
and
the
triumphant
states
were
casting
a
medal
to
celebrate
their
deliverance
representing
the
stadtholder
as
phæton
with
the
motto
excidit
by
his
great
designs
he
destroyed
the
princess
repeated
the
words
to
herself
with
a
shiver
and
the
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks
the
parrot
turning
himself
in
his
ring
suddenly
gave
a
loud
and
hoarse
cry
as
if
tired
of
the
silence
william
glanced
up
at
him
then
round
at
the
princess
who
was
hastily
drying
her
eyes
i
must
be
returning
he
said
so
soon
she
asked
in
a
trembling
voice
such
a
little
while
and
we
have
talked
nothing
but
politics
will
you
not
stay
to
dinner
madame
i
can
not
i
am
forbidden
to
be
long
abroad
without
van
ghent
answered
william
sombrely
and
since
i
do
not
choose
to
ask
a
favour
or
incur
the
suspicions
of
de
witt
i
am
as
restricted
as
a
the
princess
rose
raising
moist
and
appealing
eyes
you
only
came
to
tell
me
i
had
angered
you
she
complained
i
came
to
discover
what
de
witt
had
said
madame
i
do
not
blame
you
there
is
no
use
in
thinking
of
it
any
more
only
i
entreat
you
do
not
see
him
since
he
is
more
than
a
match
for
me
sighed
the
princess
ah
you
know
a
great
deal
for
your
she
was
a
gracious
and
charming
lady
she
adored
him
and
she
was
his
father
s
mother
but
she
had
delivered
his
town
of
orange
to
the
french
and
she
had
delivered
him
to
the
states
general
william
could
not
forgive
these
things
he
had
against
her
also
her
quarrels
with
the
proud
young
mother
he
had
worshipped
and
her
constant
coquettings
with
the
republican
party
but
he
constrained
himself
to
forbear
with
her
now
endured
her
anxieties
over
his
health
promised
to
write
to
her
and
send
bromley
with
messages
even
took
her
caresses
let
her
fold
her
perfumed
arms
about
him
and
again
kiss
his
forehead
she
went
to
the
window
and
watched
him
ride
off
through
the
rain
bromley
blonde
and
waving
his
hat
to
her
she
had
been
told
that
oliver
cromwell
had
said
this
william
son
of
the
late
king
s
daughter
will
if
he
lives
be
heard
the
words
occurred
to
her
now
with
a
mingling
of
pride
and
pain
she
also
was
often
lonely
simon

of
the
clergy

made

de
witt
arrived
at
the
huis
ten
bosch
almost
before
the
prince
had
ridden
out
of
sight
under
the
dripping
trees
he
was
a
favourite
with
the
princess
amalia
of
solms
who
was
always
served
on
gold
plate
and
the
calvinist
pastor
who
lived
on
a

year
had
much
in

she
greeted
him
warmly
telling
him
that
her
grandson
had
just
left
i
would

had
met
him
your
highness
answered
the
pastor
deeply
disappointed
you
do
not

course
she
remarked
i

of
him
madame

at

exiled
in
utrecht
hath
spoken
to
me
of
the
old
man
s
countenance
flushed

seen

i
have
seen
his
face
in

chapter
x
at
the
house
of
le
marquis
de
pomponne
hyacinthe
croix
awaiting
the
pleasure
of
his
employer
was
agreeably
diverted
by
the
view
he
had
of
an
inner
room
furnished
in
white
and
gold
and
occupied
by
two
ladies
the
house
of
de
pomponne
was
situated
in
the
outskirts
of
the
hague
and
transformed
into
as
much
resemblance
to
a
french
château
as
taste
and
money
could
accomplish
the
chamber
in
which
croix
found
himself
was
hung
with
fine
flemish
tapestry
representing
the
legend
of
ursula
and
divided
from
the
other
apartment
by
carved
doors
that
stood
open
revealing
an
elegant
room
furnished
in
spanish
leather
and
tulip
wood
and
lit
by
the
soft
radiance
of
a
crystal
lamp
seated
by
the
bright
fire
was
a
lady
in
a
brown
velvet
gown
engaged
in
making
lace
croix
knew
her
for
the
marquise
de
pomponne
the
interest
of
his
gaze
was
all
for
her
companion
she
sat
by
the
window
a
chinese
table
before
her
on
which
stood
a
set
with
scarlet
and
ivory
pieces
her
profile
face
and
figure
were
towards
croix
she
seemed
absorbed
in
some
problem
that
she
had
set
herself
for
she
did
not
raise
her
eyes
from
the
and
her
only
movement
came
when
she
lifted
her
slender
hand
to
change
one
of
the
white
or
red
men
her
delicate
features
the
knot
of
her
golden
hair
the
slender
lines
of
her
figure
in
its
tight
blue
gown
were
shown
up
distinctly
by
the
dark
background
croix
under
cover
of
the
space
between
them
stared
at
her
boldly
she
was
known
to
him
by
reputation
and
he
had
seen
her
once
before
riding
with
de
pomponne
on
the
voorhout
glad
was
he
of
the
chance
to
scrutinise
her
curiously
at
his
ease
for
she
had
a
name
powerful
at
versailles
she
was
a
woman
he
might
be
glad
to
have
a
word
from
but
he
was
well
aware
that
her
profession
was
nevertheless
the
same
as
his
own
and
that
if
she
were
more
successful
it
was
largely
because
she
was
less
scrupulous
he
had
heard
her
history
more
than
once
for
it
made
a
piquant
story
one
not
in
the
least
to
her
credit
and
containing
incidents
that
it
had
needed
a
clever
woman
to
get
the
better
of
even
at
the
court
of
france
he
wondered
what
use
de
pomponne
could
have
for
this
lady
at
the
hague
the
united
provinces
seemed
a
field
where
her
talents
could
find
but
little
scope
the
entrance
of
de
pomponne
disturbed
both
his
reflections
and
his
study
of
the
slender
lady
with
the
chessmen
the
marquis
was
not
in
the
best
of
humours
he
nodded
to
his
visitor
and
flung
himself
into
a
chair
biting
his
glove
his
first
remark
was
to
complain
that
the
candles
were
in
need
of
snuffing
a
servant
was
summoned
and
this
remedied
then
he
deigned
to
look
at
croix
this
tool
of
yours
this
van
mander
has
turned
out
very
croix
flushed
there
has
been
no
harm
monsieur
he
said
secretly
nettled
i
am
not
so
sure
first
he
returns
you
my
letter
to
the
prince
croix
was
surprised
you
said
monseigneur
that
his
highness
had
explained
he
must
avoid
even
the
appearance
of
an
well
well
the
marquis
brought
his
hand
down
impatiently
on
the
table
now
i
hear
he
has
entered
the
prince
s
but
he
is
not
to
remain
at
the
hague
replied
croix
eagerly
no
monseigneur
that
could
not
be
under
the
very
eyes
of
de
witt
he
is
to
be
sent
to
brandenburg
to
join
bentinck
at
the
elector
s
who
told
you
so
the
man
himself
then
he
is
still
in
communication
with
you
i
see
him
but
he
is
of
no
use
to
us
croix
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
can
not
it
is
your
business
to
find
out
answered
de
pomponne
arrogantly
only
i
ask
you
monseigneur
what
can
one
do
with
these
hollanders
i
have
had
this
man
in
play
for
years
but
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
is
too
much
for
you
which
is
a
pity
for
if
you
could
have
managed
him
he
would
have
been
very
he
was
inclined
to
deal
with
us
once
certainly
now
however
well
what
has
happened
to
him
now
demanded
the
marquis
sharply
he
appears
to
be
infatuated
with
the
prince
of
de
pomponne
considered
a
moment
the
prince
is
friendly
with
us
he
said
at
length
narrowing
his
fine
dark
eyes
many
of
his
followers
do
not
know
friendly
the
marquis
smiled
mon
dieu
that
is
what
i
would
like
to
know
myself
he
said
a
matter
you
can
not
discover
monseigneur
i
can
not
hope
de
pomponne
leant
on
the
table
the
candlelight
full
on
his
handsome
florid
face
his
glittering
splendid
clothes
it
must
be
discovered
he
said
and
took
his
chin
in
his
hand
thoughtfully
croix
glanced
past
him
through
the
open
door
at
the
distant
lady
in
blue
his
highness
hath
not
shown
himself
the
marquis
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
is
politic
extraordinarily
prudent
for
his
age
i
saw
him
the
other
day
he
was
courteous
protested
his
duty
to
his
majesty
still
he
refuses
our
help
he
fears
to
compromise
himself
in
the
eyes
of
de
witt
said
hyacinthe
croix
instantly
you
have
gained
nothing
from
this
van
mander
as
to
the
prince
s
actual
thoughts
no
he
is
no
way
in
his
intimacy
the
prince
has
hardly
spoken
to
what
we
need
is
to
gain
some
one
in
his
i
fear
it
is
impossible
monseigneur
answered
croix
i
believe
his
best
friends
are
triglandt
a
fanatical
calvinist
his
former
whom
it
would
be
folly
to
approach
naturally
and
the
other
m
bentinck
at
it
would
be
no
use
meddling
with
him
there
is
the
she
knows
no
more
than
i
neither
does
the
marquis
frowned
thoughtfully
i
am
baffled
at
every
turn
i
have
nothing
to
send
to
his
majesty
nothing
and
i
know
not
how
to
act
before
i
help
place
the
orange
party
in
power
i
must
be
assured
that
they
will
serve
me
when
they
have
arrived
at
the
prince
could
never
stand
alone
and
where
else
should
he
find
support
returned
croix
i
do
not
know
but
he
plays
a
deep
game
this
last
move
shows
some
say
he
has
but
damaged
himself
since
he
provoked
such
severity
from
de
that
very
severity
works
to
his
ends
since
it
further
estranges
the
people
from
de
witt
answered
the
marquis
we
may
look
out
for
a
revolution
it
is
very
that
is
not
the
point
the
question
is
what
will
this
youth
do
when
he
obtains
the
power
st
croix
lowered
his
voice
if
any
can
discover
you
have
one
in
this
house
the
marquis
glanced
at
him
you
mean
madame
lavalette
yes
she
is
leaving
for
spain
in
another
de
pomponne
tapped
his
fine
fingers
on
the
table
besides
mon
dieu
one
has
no
there
is
the
ball
at
the
binnenhof
on
friday
it
is
not
known
if
the
prince
van
mander
told
me
i
wonder
why
i
think
he
does
nothing
without
a
to
show
himself
to
speak
to
the
the
marquis
looked
over
his
shoulder
at
the
impassive
figure
of
madame
lavalette
over
her
chess
problem
he
is
a
boy
monsieur
in
some
things
utterly
i
confess
it
had
occurred
to
me
but
de
pomponne
shrugged
his
shoulders
these
hollanders
and
the
prince
is
secretive
even
for
a
still
monsieur
you
can
you
mean
madame
lavalette
can
try
answered
the
marquis
it
would
be
my
advice
take
most
men
she
would
get
more
in
five
minutes
than
i
in
a
fortnight
de
pomponne
admitted
but
whether
this
little
calvinist
he
is
seventeen
monsieur
it
is
not
possible
he
should
possess
the
wisdom
of
thrice
his
well
we
will
put
him
to
the
test
the
marquis
gave
his
indolent
smile
and
pushed
back
his
chair
hyacinthe
croix
rose
i
will
send
you
a
ticket
for
the
ball
said
the
marquis
you
had
better
be
thank
you
croix
bowed
till
his
yellow
frizzled
hair
fell
over
his
face
de
pomponne
gave
him
a
nod
and
a
wave
of
a
plump
hand
which
careless
dismissal
was
all
that
he
deigned
when
croix
had
gone
he
leant
forward
and
looked
into
the
inner
room
his
wife
had
left
it
madame
lavalette
sat
alone
fingering
the
red
and
white
pieces
the
marquis
de
pomponne
rose
and
walked
slowly
over
to
her
she
turned
on
him
large
deep
blue
and
languishing
eyes
i
have
just
solved
my
problem
she
said
in
a
low
and
pretty
voice
and
i
madame
want
you
to
help
me
solve
ah
she
sank
back
in
her
stiff
chair
and
taking
up
the
red
king
turned
him
about
in
her
fingers
the
marquis
leant
carelessly
against
the
carved
window
frame
you
overheard
perhaps
what
i
was
saying
to
monsieur
croix
no
she
glanced
up
her
fair
and
shining
hair
was
waved
simply
round
her
oval
face
and
caught
on
her
neck
with
a
pearl
comb
a
few
long
ringlets
fell
on
to
her
deep
lace
collar
her
face
had
a
soft
almost
plaintive
expression
her
mouth
was
small
and
wistful
well
said
the
marquis
i
will
desire
you
to
attend
the
ball
at
the
monsieur
she
answered
i
have
de
louvois
commands
to
go
to
but
you
may
do
me
this
service
first
madame
la
what
is
the
problem
and
the
service
monsieur
the
marquis
looking
down
at
her
indolently
frowned
now
discontentedly
the
problem
is
the
prince
of
orange
madame
and
the
service
she
interrupted
with
the
slightest
sparkle
of
malice
in
her
tone
you
call
me
in
when
you
have
failed
what
would
de
louvois
say
de
pomponne
answered
in
a
vexed
tone
i
wish
de
louvois
was
here
doing
my
work
and
i
at
versailles
doing
his
for
mon
dieu
one
might
as
well
be
sent
on
an
embassy
to
the
fishes
as
be
asked
to
come
into
exile
here
where
one
s
health
is
ruined
by
damp
one
s
temper
by
leyden
logic
where
the
only
amusement
is
the
contemplation
of
dutch
it
is
the
virtue
that
is
the
difficulty
smiled
madame
lavalette
they
are
a
quite
impossible
people
that
is
why
monsieur
i
am
going
to
spain
but
you
i
he
answered
impatiently
it
is
like
trying
to
negotiate
with
a
lot
of
frogs
cold
and
stupid
when
you
have
got
through
their
formalities
they
start
on
their
religion
and
when
they
have
finished
with
that
they
freeze
into
a
silence
that
you
want
me
to
endeavour
to
break
i
should
be
your
debtor
for
life
she
raised
her
brows
but
my
friend
what
do
you
think
i
can
do
the
marquis
knew
that
she
had
already
failed
to
obtain
even
an
audience
of
de
witt
though
she
had
come
to
the
hague
with
the
object
of
persuading
him
to
the
concessions
required
by
de
louvois
with
regard
to
the
herring
fisheries
her
question
was
therefore
pertinent
enough
i
am
thinking
of
the
madame
lavalette
showed
some
impatience
i
am
tired
of
the
whole
country
its
burghers
and
its
frogs
i
wish
to
get
madame
the
ball
is
on
friday
it
would
not
detain
you
and
the
prince
is
different
from
these
he
does
not
interest
have
you
seen
him
she
shook
her
fair
head
he
is
kept
too
well
when
you
see
him
and
speak
to
him
you
will
be
interested
she
replaced
the
red
king
on
the
board
why
he
is
an
madame
looked
up
de
pomponne
had
piqued
her
curiosity
and
her
vanity
as
he
intended
you
think
i
can
solve
this
enigma
the
marquis
smiled
if
any
one
can
i
wonder
she
mused
languidly
then
she
rose
with
a
soft
sound
of
silks
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
to
draw
from
the
prince
something
of
his
designs
something
of
his
feelings
towards
france
in
a
word
madame
to
discover
that
which
i
have
failed
to
discern
what
manner
of
stuff
we
have
there
if
he
worked
with
us
he
would
as
his
majesty
s
cousin
be
of
immense
use
he
could
without
much
difficulty
be
placed
at
the
head
of
the
state
oh
i
know
the
position
quite
well
she
interrupted
considering
that
you
have
talked
nothing
else
since
i
have
been
at
the
hague
i
should
have
it
by
heart
but
mon
dieu
whether
i
care
to
meddle
is
another
she
crossed
to
the
fireplace
and
rested
the
tip
of
her
blue
shoe
on
the
brass
curb
it
will
be
very
little
trouble
to
you
madame
and
a
vast
service
to
the
duchess
looked
at
him
over
her
shoulder
with
a
little
laugh
my
good
de
pomponne
this
country
is
unnerving
you
the
marquis
did
not
deny
it
i
always
protested
against
the
appointment
as
you
must
remember
but
de
louvois
was
as
he
always
is
grumbled
de
pomponne
madame
lavalette
tapped
her
chin
with
the
tips
of
her
feather
fan
the
prince
hates
women
i
think
she
said
and
all
manner
of
frivolities
he
is
as
austere
as
john
de
witt
but
a
great
deal
and
not
so
confirmed
in
severity
she
smiled
and
raised
a
face
that
was
glowing
a
golden
in
the
radiance
of
the
fire
maybe
he
hath
lacked
opportunity
she
added
had
he
even
the
nature
of
a
rake
he
could
hardly
have
shown
it
under
de
witt
s
mon
dieu
no
the
duchess
looked
thoughtfully
into
the
clear
flames
she
was
angry
with
de
witt
for
having
refused
her
an
opportunity
to
execute
her
mission
did
she
succeed
in
drawing
the
prince
of
orange
she
might
avenge
herself
on
the
severe
grand
pensionary
and
not
wholly
fail
towards
de
louvois
she
foresaw
that
let
de
witt
once
see
her
even
speaking
to
william
he
would
take
care
no
other
chance
would
be
given
for
the
continuance
of
her
intrigues
for
he
knew
both
her
character
and
her
mission
but
madame
lavalette
decided
she
might
be
careless
there
for
she
was
leaving
holland
she
could
also
rely
on
accomplishing
much
in
a
short
time
she
was
not
generally
unsuccessful
the
thought
of
a
youthful
and
royal
scipio
was
not
displeasing
to
her
vanity
and
to
play
cleopatra
to
an
augustus
of
seventeen
seemed
to
the
duchess
both
safe
and
amusing
she
turned
her
languishing
eyes
on

handsome
indolent
face
get

a
ticket
for
the
ball
at

monseigneur
she
said

xi
the
ball
in
the
binnenhof
you
are
disappointed
inquired
bromley
florent
van
mander
answered
slowly
i
should
have
liked
to
stay
in
the
but
you
see
it
is
impossible
the
englishman
assured
him
with
frank
friendliness
m
de
witt
hath
already
spoken
to
his
highness
about
the
harbouring
of
any
who
forsake
his
service
and
indeed
the
prince
is
scarcely
free
to
choose
his
florent
was
silent
his
desire
was
to
serve
the
prince
personally
to
have
some
chance
of
winning
his
favour
to
be
in
the
thick
of
events
at
the
hague
the
seat
of
action
brandenburg
seemed
far
away
and
he
had
no
interest
in
bentinck
it
was
not
for
this
that
he
had
left
john
de
witt
but
having
burnt
his
bridges
behind
him
there
was
nothing
to
do
save
to
go
on
bromley
saw
by
his
face
he
was
not
pleased
it
shows
his
highness
thinks
something
of
you
mander
he
remarked
that
he
puts
himself
to
this
trouble
and
bentinck
is
his
best
they
stood
in
one
of
the
bare
of
the
prince
s
palace
van
ghent
had
allowed
william
to
see
the
secretary
he
was
sending
to
the
elector
s
court
and
florent
awaited
his
audience
he
would
rather
have
been
alone
or
silent
but
matthew
bromley
s
pleasant
manners
would
not
tolerate
pauses
he
snuffed
the
candles
pulled
the
dark
curtains
closer
and
remarked
that
it
was
cold
and
the
night
of
the
ball
at
the
the
prince
is
going
asked
florent
yes
bromley
answered
with
some
reserve
the
ball
was
in
honour
of
the
wedding
of
one
of
de
witt
s
cousins
william
s
invitation
had
been
a
command
florent
looked
at
the
englishman
keenly
you
are
very
devoted
to
his
highness
are
you
not
he
asked
curiously
i
am
said
matthew
bromley
simply
but
you
were
in
de
witt
s
employ
only
before
i
knew
the
that
is
what
i
mean
florent
spoke
quickly
before
you
knew
the
prince
he
can
not
do
for
you
what
de
witt
could
indeed
he
can
do
nothing
at
all
why
are
you
devoted
to
him
bromley
s
fair
face
took
on
a
puzzled
expression
he
reflected
hesitated
i
do
not
know
he
said
at
last
florent
drew
a
deep
breath
neither
do
i
also
have
left
de
witt
and
in
a
way
ruined
myself
and
i
do
not
know
i
like
his
highness
went
on
bromley
still
trying
to
honestly
answer
the
question
why
are
devoted
to
him
but
every
one
who
comes
near
him
would
serve
him
to
the
death
again
he
reflected
again
he
added
i
do
not
know
he
glanced
up
at
florent
s
grave
face
and
laughed
i
have
no
interest
in
your
politics
you
see
mynheer
for
me
one
is
like
another
i
think
de
witt
is
a
great
and
good
man
and
i
really
know
nothing
about
the
prince
s
character
or
designs
but
well
i
just
serve
i
would
follow
him
florent
walked
up
and
down
the
chamber
he
wore
his
dark
travelling
clothes
for
he
was
impatient
since
he
must
go
to
be
off
at
once
the
place
had
become
intolerable
of
late
since
he
was
always
afraid
of
meeting
some
of
his
old
companions
or
even
de
witt
himself
bromley
rubbed
his
hands
together
the
large
princely
but
bare
room
was
certainly
both
dreary
and
cold
scantily
furnished
and
ill
lit
by
the
candlesticks
on
the
mantelshelf
the
pause
was
broken
by
the
quick
opening
of
the
door
both
the
men
looked
round
it
was
the
prince
though
florent
did
not
instantly
know
him
he
wore
a
long
dark
mantle
and
a
plumed
hat
he
did
not
uncover
he
exacted
as
if
by
instinct
the
privileges
of
royalty
and
his
household
conceded
them
despite
de
witt
he
was
surrounded
by
a
court
mynheer
van
mander
he
said
with
his
usual
slowness
florent
flushed
and
bowed
over
low
for
a
good
republican
the
prince
came
down
the
long
chamber
are
you
prepared
to
go
to
brandenburg
he
asked
yes
your
william
made
no
answer
and
florent
glanced
half
covertly
at
his
face
the
prince
was
looking
thoughtfully
at
the
floor
his
features
almost
concealed
by
the
shadow
of
his
hat
under
his
mantle
could
be
seen
the
soft
colour
of
his
pale
violet
coat
one
of
his
bare
hands
rested
on
his
cravat
in
the
other
he
held
a
letter
he
spoke
without
looking
up
i
do
not
know
that
you
gain
much
by
the
change
of
masters
mynheer
van
mander
it
is
very
quiet
at
my
uncle
the
elector
s
court
and
bentinck
can
only
pay
you
i
have
decided
to
accept
the
post
your
the
prince
slowly
raised
the
eyes
he
knew
so
well
how
to
use
and
let
them
rest
a
moment
on
florent
s
face
i
can
promise
nothing
to
any
one
he
said
so
if
this
is
to
worship
the
rising
sun
think
a
under
william
s
glance
florent
s
first
flush
deepened
i
shall
be
glad
in
any
way
to
serve
your
highness
he
answered
awkwardly
william
faintly
smiled
and
half
mockingly
put
to
him
the
question
he
had
put
to
matthew
bromley
why
florent
faced
the
compelling
gaze
fixed
on
him
and
found
this
time
an
answer
your
highness
makes
me
feel
as
i
have
never
felt
till
that
is
curious
said
the
prince
for
i
have
seen
very
little
of
you
mynheer
van
but
i
have
seen
enough
of
your
highness
replied
florent
the
prince
was
silent
his
bearing
seemed
if
anything
to
repel
this
homage
but
florent
was
sufficiently
pleased
that
it
was
not
utterly
refused
his
annoyance
at
being
sent
to
brandenburg
his
regrets
for
de
witt
s
comfortable
service
had
vanished
when
he
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
the
prince
william
s
subtle
but
amazingly
powerful
personal
influence
outweighed
all
considerations
he
awaited
his
instructions
he
also
had
caught
the
trick
of
the
court
he
followed
bromley
s
example
and
waited
for
the
prince
to
address
him
william
looked
down
again
and
coughed
then
handed
florent
the
letter
this
is
for
bentinck
it
is
your
introduction
and
your
credentials
if
you
wish
to
serve
me
you
will
serve
bentinck
it
is
the
same
florent
bent
his
head
and
placed
the
letter
inside
his
breast
pocket
m
renswoude
will
meet
you
downstairs
and
give
you
the
money
for
your
journey
continued
the
prince
mynheer
van
that
was
all
william
uttered
none
of
those
things
that
florent
up
to
the
last
even
might
have
been
expecting
neither
thanks
nor
caution
did
the
prince
give
him
did
not
bid
him
be
faithful
or
discreet
yet
expressed
no
trust
in
him
gave
no
explanation
of
and
passed
no
comment
on
his
choice
of
him
for
this
service
he
walked
slowly
towards
the
door
and
florent
in
leaving
the
room
must
pass
him
the
prince
suddenly
held
out
his
hand
and
smiled
florent
felt
the
blood
glow
in
his
face
he
went
on
one
knee
and
raised
the
soft
white
and
beautiful
hand
to
his
lips
william
wore
a
diamond
ring
and
the
lace
round
his
wrist
was
faintly
perfumed
florent
noticed
this
it
was
part
of
the
appeal
of
rank
and
tradition
the
fascination
of
royalty
when
he
rose
the
prince
was
no
longer
smiling
but
florent
was
amply
repaid
for
any
sacrifice
he
had
made
in
joining
his
service
william
turned
away
as
he
left
the
room
and
walked
back
to
where
bromley
waited
that
man
can
be
faithful
he
said
as
the
door
closed
on
florent
bromley
made
a
little
grimace
he
has
not
been
faithful
to
de
witt
but
he
will
be
loyal
to
me
answered
the
prince
carelessly
you
have
the
trick
of
it
highness
admitted
matthew
bromley
william
frowned
bromley
guessed
him
to
be
in
an
exceeding
and
ventured
on
no
more
van
ghent
sent
up
to
say
he
was
waiting
for
his
highness
the
prince
discovered
that
he
had
forgotten
his
gloves
and
bromley
went
for
them
when
he
returned
the
prince
was
still
in
his
anteroom
and
van
ghent
still
waiting
below
william
took
the
gloves
leisurely
what
are
these
he
asked
they
were
a
pair
of
white
doeskin
which
bromley
had
from
the
prince
s
valet
he
said
so
william
turned
them
over
then
put
one
on
they
are
a
misfit
and
of
paltry
quality
he
remarked
who
bought
them
heenvliet
who
had
been
sent
by
the
prince
s
tutor
entering
at
the
moment
interrupted
the
coach
is
ready
your
highness
and
van
ghent
is
william
gave
him
a
half
glance
why
so
you
he
turned
to
bromley
fetch
la
matthew
bromley
hesitated
but
there
was
a
set
to
the
prince
s
cleft
chin
intimating
to
those
who
knew
him
that
his
mood
was
to
override
opposition
bromley
obeyed
william
pulled
off
the
white
glove
and
when
the
valet
entered
the
room
turned
to
him
angrily
who
bought
these
mynheer
heenvliet
how
much
was
given
for
them
la
motte
looked
at
heenvliet
the
gloves
cost
six
gulden
a
pair
highness
said
that
gentleman
and
they
are
such
as
your
highness
hath
often
worn
my
faith
no
replied
william
i
have
never
worn
such
gauntlets
six
gulden
a
pair
i
do
not
know
what
is
the
motive
of
this
economy
but
i
will
not
endure
it
kerckhove
lord
of
heenvliet
flushed
your
clothes
are
bought
under
the
approval
of
van
ghent
highness
and
the
authority
of
mynheer
de
the
prince
s
eyes
were
dangerously
bright
all
of
which
makes
no
difference
mynheer
my
income
is
sufficient
to
dress
me
better
than
a
german
bromley
held
his
peace
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
gloves
were
well
enough
and
that
the
prince
wished
to
provoke
his
hated
tutor
since
his
highness
lost
no
possible
opportunity
for
annoying
van
ghent
this
is
merely
vexatious
highness
said
heenvliet
and
i
must
again
remind
you
that
for
a
trifling
affair
you
keep
van
ghent
it
is
no
trifling
affair
mynheer
answered
william
to
find
myself
on
every
hand
ill
that
is
not
just
the
lord
of
heenvliet
was
forcing
back
his
temper
william
flung
the
gloves
down
on
a
chair
i
do
not
intend
to
wear
them
mynheer
either
or
any
other
heenvliet
bit
his
lip
and
turned
to
the
valet
bring
his
highness
another
pair
of
he
pulled
out
his
watch
impatiently
we
are
already
the
prince
gave
him
a
malicious
look
and
half
smiled
to
arrive
late
would
be
to
solve
the
ugly
question
of
precedence
and
would
also
mean
a
slight
to
de
witt
it
is
your
place
mynheer
he
answered
to
see
that
i
am
better
he
had
never
liked
heenvliet
who
leant
to
the
side
of
the
grand
pensionary
la
motte
is
a
wearisome
time
remarked
the
first
to
cover
a
somewhat
heavy
pause
he
finds
it
difficult
to
discover
anything
wearable
mynheer
answered
the
prince
calmly
and
to
point
his
dislike
of
heenvliet
he
approached
bromley
turning
his
back
on
the
other
are
not
you
cold
bromley
there
should
have
been
a
fire
indeed
i
think
so
highness
answered
the
englishman
who
was
not
cold
in
the
least
but
who
would
have
seconded
the
prince
in
anything
even
at
the
risk
of
his
own
disgrace
it
seemed
that
heenvliet
was
about
to
answer
this
thrust
at
the
management
of
the
palace
when
van
ghent
entered
with
a
vexed
and
flushed
countenance
what
is
the
cause
of
this
delay
he
demanded
looking
about
him
the
prince
was
coldly
silent
his
highness
complains
of
the
gloves
brought
him
answered
heenvliet
and
takes
this
occasion
to
complain
of
the
way
in
which
he
is
van

fixed
his
eyes
on
the

i
been
kept
waiting
for
this
for
this
mynheer
replied
william
the

appeared
both
angered
and
agitated
william

his

a
burden
m
de

be
displeased
at
our
late

william
gave
him
a
haughty
look
tell
him
i
will
not

and
that
till
i
have
a

in

choice
of
my
personal
appointments
i
shall
continue
to
be
dissatisfied
with
van

goaded
turned
with
a
weakness
that
further
earned
william
s
contempt
on
heenvliet
why
is
not
his

consulted
his
highness
is
shown
the
accounts
answered
the
unfortunate
the
accounts
repeated
his
highness
sardonically
tis
the
difference
between
them
and
what
i
am
served
with
that
i
complain
heenvliet
with
difficulty
controlled
a
hot
answer
van
ghent
picked
up
the
gloves
what
does
your
highness
find
fault
with
he
asked
no
gentleman
in
the
hague
would
wear
them
replied
the
prince
and
i
complain
mynheer
of
the
insult
offered
me
in
providing
the
gloves
were
bought
after
the
pattern
of
others
that
have
been
to
his
highness
liking
protested
heenvliet
la
motte
entered
with
another
pair
white
trimmed
with
silver
that
the
prince
deigned
to
approve
as
he
drew
them
on
his
glance
travelled
from
one
to
another
with
a
malicious
pleasure
in
the
general
discomfiture
van
ghent
reprimanded
heenvliet
who
in
turn
blamed
the
valet
bromley
looked
uncomfortable
william
was
the
one
unmoved
he
even
slightly
smiled
to
see
how
red
and
annoyed
was
van
ghent
and
when
he
reflected
how
late
they
would
be
at
the
binnenhof
his
smile
deepened
he
would
have
refused
to
attend
the
ball
at
all
had
he
dared
but
the
humiliation
of
his
forced
appearance
was
softened
by
the
thought
of
a
late
arrival
that
would
annoy
de
witt
and
cheat
de
montbas
and
de
pomponne
of
the
triumph
of
precedence
it
is
a
pity
to
keep
the
horses
waiting
in
the
wet
mynheer
he
remarked
as
he
finished
lacing
his
gloves
i
am
van

had
to
make
the
best
of
this
as
he
had
to
make
the
best
of
numerous
encounters
in
which
his
highness
was
invariably
victorious
the
prince
made
another
difficulty
about
the
coach
wishing
to
ride
alone
with
bromley
but
here
van
ghent
was
firm
he
trusted
neither
william
nor
matthew
bromley
and
himself
accompanied
his
highness
it
was
a
foggy
night
a
little
rain
falling
and
the
prince
avenged
himself
on
his
tutor
by
insisting
on
having
both
the
coach
windows
down
he
declared
he
could
not
breathe
with
them
closed
and
van
ghent
had
to
submit
and
allow
the
damp
and
the
mist
to
enter
to
his
great
discomfort
he
shivered
in
his
mantle
and
william
coughed
in
a
way
that
seemed
to
show
he
did
not
greatly
benefit
by
the
arrangement
himself
but
he
remained
resolutely
by
the
window
looking
out
at
the
streets
of
the
hague
his
back
towards
his
tutor
and
the
mist
gathering
in
drops
of
moisture
on
his
velvet
coat
van
ghent
who
by
no
means
enjoyed
thrusting
his
company
where
it
was
so
obviously
resented
was
greatly
pleased
when
they
reached
the
binnenhof
they
had
some
difficulty
in
making
their
way
through
the
coaches
that
blocked
the
courtyard
william
noted
with
satisfaction
and
van
ghent
with
annoyance
that
theirs
was
the
last
arrival
it
was
on
bromley
s
arm
that
the
prince
leant
in
entering
van
ghent
had
no
choice
but
to
follow
the
binnenhof
was
brilliantly
lit
and
decorated
with
an
air
of
solid
unpretentious
wealth
characteristic
of
the
united
provinces
the
truce
saloon
built
by
the
last
stadtholder
had
been
arranged
as
a
ballroom
this
was
a
pleasant
chamber
a
row
of
handsome
windows
overlooked
the
vyver
giving
in
summer
a
charming
view
over
the
water
and
as
far
as
de
witt
s
house
in
the
kneuterdyk
avenue
in
autumn
only
the
dim
shapes
of
trees
and
the
swans
on
the
island
were
visible
through
the
almost
perpetual
mist
now
red
velvet
curtains
screened
the
night
and
a
hundred
wax
candles
gave
a
soft
and
lovely
light
it
was
an
historic
chamber
also
and
one
that
commemorated
the
dearly
bought
freedom
of
the
republic
the
pride
of
the
assembly
and
the
fantasy
of
the
artist
had
designed
a
symbolic
decoration
circular
ceiling
paintings
represented
the
different
nations
gazing
down
at
the
spectacle
of
the
regained
liberty
of
the
united
provinces
a
fine
warmly
flushed
picture
of
peace
faced
the
door
and
above
the
deep
fireplace
its
companion
in
the
centre
of
the
ceiling
england
looked
down
and
appeared
to
be
coming
down
too
since
the
foremost
cavalier
of
the
group
had
placed
a
leg
outside
his
frame
which
was
good
painting
and
better
symbolism
said
some
sourly
twenty
years
had
passed
and
there
had
begun
to
be
reason
to
doubt
the
friendly
onlooking
of
england
her
regard
appeared
of
late
to
be
filled
with
coldness
and
envy
france
represented
by
an
effeminate
cavalier
had
its
place
above
the
picture
of
every
one
agreed
that
as
for
symbolism
this
was
not
so
good
in
the
antechamber
of
the
truce
saloon
a
fine
apartment
in
panelled
wood
the
prince
found
the
grand
pensionary
with
de
witt
were
vivien
his
and
pensionary
of
dordt
sir
william
temple
and
de
montbas
van
ghent
stepped
up
to
these
gentlemen
but
william
s
hand
tightened
on
matthew
bromley
s
arm
and
held
him
back
the
englishman
was
quick
to
understand
his
highness
gaze
was
resting
on
de
montbas
who
wore
the
splendid
uniform
of
the
captain
general
and
was
girded
with
the
sword
that
meant
command
of
all
the
forces
of
the
united
provinces
a
shiver
went
through
the
prince
s
slender
body
after
a
moment
he
left
his
gentleman
and
came
forward
de
witt
greeted
him
quietly
i
am
sorry
you
are
late
highness
he
added
quietly
william
gave
his
reply
with
perfect
composure
it
was
greatly
against
my
wish
mynheer
he
said
and
he
spoke
softly
and
even
smiled
i
will
believe
you
the
prince
glanced
at
de
witt
s
companions
he
did
not
dislike
sir
william
temple
but
the
others
were
his
avowed
opponents
several
members
of
the
assembly
advanced
to
greet
him
he
had
to
put
a
strain
on
himself
and
speak
to
them
graciously
but
when
he
came
to
de
montbas
it
seemed
that
his
control
would
fail
him
this
man
had
been
in
his
father
s
employ
had
deserted
him
for
the
republican
party
he
had
been
one
of
those
who
held
the
gates
of
amsterdam
against
the
late
stadtholder
one
of
those
who
had
spoken
most
hotly
against
him
later
de
montbas
had
made
overtures
to
the
widowed
princess
they
had
been
haughtily
spurned
though
amalia
of
solms
remained
inclined
to
encourage
a
person
of
so
much
influence
to
complete
the
bitter
hatred
in
which
william
held
him
de
montbas
was
a
man
of
wealth
and
abilities
and
now
in
possession
of
those
offices
that
were
his
birthright
the
birthright
of
the
heir
of
nassau
as
de
montbas
approached
him
the
prince
perceptibly
drew
back
and
his
pallor
disappeared
under
a
slow
blush
he
straightened
himself
pressed
his
handkerchief
to
his
lips
and
eyed
the
count
with
an
expression
of
scorn
and
dislike
not
to
be
concealed
nor
mistaken
no
one
there
could
guess
what
throbbing
rage
filled
his
proud
soul
that
he
had
to
stand
thus
swordless
before
his
father
s
enemies
a
show
for
those
who
were
both
his
inferiors
and
his
masters
but
all
could
see
the
sudden
expression
that
sprang
into
his
eyes
and
all
were
startled
de
montbas
ill
at
ease
made
a
mistake
he
resorted
to
a
courtesy
not
untouched
by
cringing
it
was
the
one
thing
above
all
others
to
rouse
william
s
fiercest
scorn
i
am
glad
to
have
this
opportunity
of
paying
my
duty
to
your
highness
he
said
and
bowed
like
a
courtier
william
smiled
bitterly
your
duty
he
repeated
your
duty
le
comte
then
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
passed
into
the
ballroom
de
montbas
flushing
hotly
looked
at
de
witt
and
the
grand
pensionary
frowned
it
fell
to
sir
william
s
easy
tact
to
break
the
pause
i
think
the
dance
has
come
to
an
end
sir
are
we
too
grave
to
attend
the
ladies
secretly
he
admired
the
prince
and
his
admiration
grew
with
his
observation
his
eyes
twinkled
now
with
enjoyment
of
de
montbas
discomfiture
de
witt
was
quick
enough
to
see
where
his
sympathies
lay
but
he
accepted
the
diversion
of
sir
william
s
remark
for
the
prince
s
daring
could
not
be
publicly
noticed
de
witt
composed
in
mien
but
with
a
troubled
heart
followed
into
the
ballroom
most
noticeable
as
he
entered
was
the
figure
of
the
young
man
in
the
long
violet
coat
his
bright
heavy
hair
glittering
like
copper
in
the
candlelight
he
was
speaking
to
the
princess
dowager
above
them
glowed
the
picture
of
your
charge
troubles
you
mynheer
said
sir
william
in
his
soft
lazy
voice
after
watching
de
witt
a
moment
in
so
far
that
i
do
not
understand
him
yes
answered
the
grand
pensionary
the
company
walking
to
and
fro
in
their
velvet
and
satin
dresses
shut
out
the
long
violet
coat
and
william
s
slender
figure
he
is
a
remarkable
young
the
englishman
spoke
reflectively
he
is
like
his
father
responded
john
de
witt
with
a
sir
william
smiled
the
late
stadtholder
failed
this
prince

think

the
spy
of
france
the
princess
beckoned
her
grandson
with
her
long
gold
fan
you
have
been
talking
to
madame
van
decken
the
whole
evening
she
said
william
having
advanced
beside
her
chair
waited
without
any
show
of
interest
for
the
princess
to
enlarge
on
her
remark
madame
van
decken
is
quite
the
plainest
lady
in
the
is
she
amalia
of
solms
half
laughed
why
she
squints
yes
i
noticed
that
answered
william
but
she
is
very
the
princess
looked
at
him
in
a
half
troubled
way
at
your
age
she
exclaimed
there
are
half
a
hundred
ladies
awaiting
your
request
for
a
dance
i
shall
not
dance
at
all
he
interrupted
what
are
we
here
for
madame
merely
to
grace
de
witt
s
the
princess
gave
a
sigh
that
flashed
the
diamonds
on
her
purple
bodice
i
wish
you
would
not
take
it
so
de
witt
means
to
be
what
courtesy
was
it
that
forced
me
and
de
montbas
to
meet
he
wishes
to
reconcile
william
smiled
scornfully
the
fiddles
were
tuning
up
and
the
dancers
taking
their
places
on
the
polished
floor
you
make
a
mistake
said
amalia
of
solms
these
women
have
some
influence
they
have
a
right
to
feel
slighted
you
should
take
more
pains
to
the
prince
made
no
reply
amalia
of
solms
cast
a
half
timid
glance
at
his
composed
profile
and
the
fan
fluttered
nervously
on
her
velvet
lap
you
think
that
i
am
a
silly
old
woman
no
doubt
william
but
believe
me
i
am
right
de
pomponne
said
the
same
to
me
that
you
kept
yourself
too
the
violins
struck
up
a
french
sarabande
and
the
dancers
began
to
move
slowly
to
the
stately
melody
the
prince
looked
across
the
ballroom
to
where
de
witt
noticeable
in
black
velvet
stood
in
the
doorway
talking
to
a
little
group
of
gentlemen
and
so
absorbed
was
he
in
his
scrutiny
that
he
did
not
hear
the
princess
rise
she
had
to
touch
him
on
the
arm
to
attract
his
attention
m
de
pomponne
he
turned
quickly
the
princess
swept
a
courtesy
before
she
sank
again
into
her
gilt
chair
and
the
marquis
gorgeously
dressed
in
crimson
satin
bowed
till
his
long
hid
his
face
is
not
the
prince
dancing
highness
he
asked
william
s
intent
gaze
was
now
fixed
on
the
frenchman
he
said
nothing
the
princess
shrugged
her
shoulders
half
vexed
you
must
ask
him
the
marquis
smiled
there
is
a
lady
present
whom
i
have
promised
to
present
to
his
highness
one
of
your
countrywomen
monsieur
asked
the
princess
yes
i
shall
be
honoured
the
prince
s
tone
was
quiet
i
refer
to
the
duchesse
de
lavalette
will
your
highness
accompany
me
something
to
his
grandmother
s
surprise
william
went
instantly
the
princess
watched
the
two
figures
turn
out
of
the
ballroom
with
some
satisfaction
she
had
always
considered
the
french
alliance
her
grandson
s
best
hope
the
antechamber
was
full
of
the
music
of
the
sarabande
that
came
through
the
open
doors
the
music
and
the
sound
of
the
ladies
dresses
as
they
swept
the
polished
floor
de
pomponne
stepped
quickly
up
to
one
of
them
who
sat
alone
on
a
carved
settee
madame
la
duchesse
i
present
to
you
his
highness
the
prince
of
orange
monseigneur
madame
she
rose
and
each
took
a
swift
look
at
the
other
william
saw
a
woman
of
a
dazzling
fairness
of
hair
and
complexion
and
bright
blue
eyes
wearing
a
and
rich
gown
of
green
velvet
and
madame
lavalette
beheld
a
slight
youth
owning
a
remarkable
face
plainly
dressed
and
of
a
haughty
demeanour
she
gave
him
a
glance
of
pretty
hesitation
alas
i
have
not
your
language
monseigneur
i
can
speak
yours
madame
he
answered
in
french
ah
i
have
heard
that
your
highness
is
an
accomplished
it
is
not
an
accomplishment
madame
but
a
many
princes
do
not
think
her
eyes
flattered
him
though
her
lips
were
unsmiling
i
do
not
speak
as
a
prince
he
was
absolutely
grave
and
in
no
way
discomposed
by
her
splendid
presence
as
a
diplomat
then
as
one
training
to
be
of
service
to
his
country
her
delicate
eyebrows
slightly
arched
do
you
wish
your
gifts
to
be
of
service
to
the
republic
prince
the
united
provinces
are
the
republic
madame
and
the
united
provinces
are
my
madame
lavalette
unfurled
her
fan
it
is
generous
of
you
monseigneur
to
be
patriotic
under
the
present
form
of
government
why
madame
she
found
him
at
once
more
difficult
than
she
had
expected
and
it
roused
her
oh
perhaps
it
is
not
generous
but
politic
she
said
with
a
change
of
tone
then
she
laughed
and
looked
at
him
straightly
personally
i
do
not
like
de
witt
she
declared
with
a
charming
air
of
frankness
william
raised
his
expressive
eyes
slowly
he
is
my
best
friend
the
duchess
gazing
at
him
intently
read
in
his
eyes
the
contradiction
of
his
words
i
see
what
you
mean
me
to
believe
prince
she
murmured
the
second
measure
of
the
sarabande
had
begun
madame
lavalette
beat
time
to
it
with
her
fan
on
her
delicate
hand
it
is
a
pretty
melody
do
you
like
music
monseigneur
i
think
it
can
be
made
useful
that
is
a
curious
thing
to
say
you
mean
in
war
he
said
she
gave
her
rare
effective
smile
and
in
peace
it
is
not
necessary
now
the
duchess
sighed
you
can
say
as
much
of
all
the
arts
but
your
highness
is
not
always
so
stern
i
am
very
ignorant
on
these
matters
madame
he
answered
you
like
gardening
she
asked
knowing
he
did
it
is
a
pleasant
recreation
and
i
think
the
building
of
houses
a
fair
pastime
for
a
she
flushed
into
enthusiasm
you
should
see
meudon
marli
versailles
she
cried
you
would
appreciate
them
palaces
he
interrupted
her
such
as
i
shall
never
achieve
madame
my
father
built
these
modest
rooms
nor
am
i
like
to
build
anything
she
glanced
at
his
grave
young
face
now
why
she
asked
her
voice
falling
softly
because
i
think
to
have
other
things
to
do
the
sarabande
had
come
to
an
end
the
prince
turned
to
his
companion
with
a
composed
air
of
courtliness
may
i
lead
you
out
for
the
next
measure
madame
i
shall
be
honoured
her
eyes
added
more
there
was
something
in
the
very
carriage
of
her
body
as
she
bent
towards
him
her
head
slightly
drooping
that
was
subtly
flattering
the
more
so
that
it
came
from
a
beautiful
woman
to
a
youth
she
was
more
deferential
and
charming
than
she
had
meant
to
be
for
his
grave
coldness
forced
her
to
use
her
weapons
seventeen
she
said
to
herself
mon
dieu
seventeen
the
next
dance
was
a
minuet
the
music
by
lulli
she
informed
the
prince
and
called
le
temple
de
la
paix
take
me
to
represent
france
monseigneur
and
the
title
as
an
omen
of
peace
madame
do
you
not
care
to
think
of
peace
monsieur
i
am
madame
in
no
position
to
think
of
as
they
passed
into
the
ballroom
she
shot
a
look
at
de
pomponne
the
prince
was
at
least
dancing
with
her
her
eyes
bid
the
marquis
take
note
of
it
he
was
not
the
only
one
to
observe
them
the
princess
marked
with
satisfaction
and
de
witt
with
uneasiness
the
prince
s
partner
for
the
minuet
happily
la
lavalette
was
below
the
middle
height
and
william
tall
for
his
age
so
she
was
able
to
rest
lightly
on
his
arm
and
look
up
to
him
with
blue
languishing
eyes
that
held
a
very
flattering
deference
de
pomponne
turned
away
to
hide
his
smile
de
witt
looked
on
sternly
the
duchess
glanced
at
the
paintings
round
the
ceiling
your
highness
likes
history
she
asked
you
like
to
read
it
i
would
prefer
to
make
it
she
looked
at
him
quickly
your
house
has
made
it
he
smiled
madame
it
is
through
my
house
that
we
are
here
now
it
is
through
my
ancestors
and
by
what
they
have
done
that
the
united
provinces
are
a
the
country
hath
been
ungrateful
his
smile
made
her
air
of
sympathy
seem
foolish
you
think
so
he
said
she
was
piqued
by
his
sovereign
manner
do
not
you
monseigneur
she
retaliated
with
meaning
i
think
it
remains
to
be
proved
madame
la
they
stood
by
the
open
hearth
waiting
for
the
dance
to
begin
she
was
very
well
aware
of
the
curious
eyes
upon
them
and
of
the
cold
regard
of
the
grand
pensionary
the
prince
appeared
absolutely
unconscious
m
de
witt
does
not
dance
i
see
she
remarked
he
hath
other
things
to
think
of
she
gave
him
a
grave
but
ardent
look
such
as
revolutions
she
breathed
maybe
madame
the
most
securely
placed
will
sometimes
think
of
madame
lavalette
was
silent
de
pomponne
had
not
prepared
her
for
a
youth
so
haughtily
so
seemingly
impervious
to
flattery
and
enticements
she
knew
of
his
upbringing
in
austere
surroundings
she
knew
something
of
the
dutch
stateliness
of
manner
but
this
perfect
composure
and
gravity
on
the
part
of
a
prince
of
seventeen
were
nevertheless
a
surprise
madame
lavalette
was
familiar
with
most
of
the
courts
of
europe
and
had
considered
herself
equally
familiar
with
most
types
of
men
even
men
like
john
de
witt
such
were
rare
but
she
had
met
them
but
in
william
of
orange
she
found
what
she
could
not
place
or
label
she
went
cautiously
a
little
bewildered
a
little
piqued
and
more
impressed
by
this
boy
s
personality
than
she
would
have
cared
to
admit
the
musicians
played
the
prelude
the
couples
took
their
places
madame
lavalette
glanced
again
at
the
marquis
who
danced
with
lady
temple
and
he
raised
his
brows
and
slightly
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
if
he
commiserated
her
on
an
impossible
task
sully
s
lilting
melody
began
the
prince
danced
as
he
rode
with
consummate
excellence
but
unlike
his
horsemanship
his
dancing
was
without
animation
it
seemed
to
his
partner
that
he
was
not
listening
to
the
music
in
the
least
nor
thinking
of
her
at
all
once
or
twice
he
looked
distinctly
away
from
her
in
a
mournful
absent
manner
down
the
room
as
if
he
looked
through
the
dancers
and
saw
something
else
beyond
when
their
hands
touched
she
felt
his
cool
fingers
resting
on
hers
as
lightly
as
they
might
have
rested
on
his
gentleman
s
shoulder
she
was
silent
until
the
elaborate
figures
had
come
to
an
end
then
she
laughed
your
highness
does
not
like
he
turned
his
great
eyes
on
her
i
have
been
clumsy
madame
no
you
have
it
in
your
head
perfectly
prince
not
i
think
in
the
least
in
your
that
is
probably
true
he
replied
gravely
it
is
a
pity
prince
for
the
she
suddenly
laid
her
hand
on
his
sleeve
whom
will
your
highness
dance
with
now
i
shall
dance
no
more
you
are
very
severe
monseigneur
or
are
you
proud
i
am
tired
said
william
simply
they
returned
slowly
to
the
antechamber
and
reseated
themselves
on
the
carved
seat
where
he
had
first
found
her
behind
them
a
crescent
of
candles
in
a
silver
sconce
lit
her
fair
hair
her
white
shoulders
and
the
voluminous
folds
of
her
green
velvet
gown
she
unfurled
her
fan
and
gazed
at
herself
in
the
little
mirror
in
the
centre
of
curling
feathers
i
think
you
are
somewhat
heartless
she
remarked
every
lady
in
the
ballroom
wishes
to
dance
with
your
highness
and
i
dare
swear
half
of
them
are
your
admirers
glancing
at
him
furtively
she
perceived
that
in
utter
absence
of
vanity
he
did
not
even
colour
there
are
other
cavaliers
here
madame
lavalette
beat
her
little
silver
shoe
on
the
gleaming
floor
and
so
de
witt
is
your
best
friend
the
sudden
change
of
attack
did
not
confuse
him
i
said
so
i
know
a
she
fixed
her
eyes
boldly
on
his
face
and
leant
forward
a
little
holding
the
open
fan
william
did
not
answer
he
was
looking
away
from
her
through
the
doorway
into
the
ballroom
where
under
the
picture
of
war
the
grand
pensionary
conversed
with
de
pomponne
your
highness
can
guess
whom
i
mean
breathed
madame
lavalette
why
no
the
fan
fluttered
and
the
mirror
in
the
centre
gave
out
golden
rays
as
it
caught
the
candlelight
your
cousin
louis
highness
she
said
under
her
breath
now
he
turned
his
head
and
fixed
on
her
his
compelling
gaze
the
king
of
france
she
repeated
i
have
always
hoped
to
deserve
his
majesty
s
friendship
said
william
formally
madame
lavalette
fixed
his
eyes
with
her
glance
will
you
not
be
more
frank
with
me
prince
she
said
in
a
low
voice
in
what
manner
madame
ah
you
know
she
leant
towards
him
i
speak
of
the
king
of
france
you
know
what
he
can
do
for
william
moved
his
head
so
that
the
heavy
auburn
hair
concealed
his
face
she
thought
that
he
still
looked
at
de
witt
for
a
moment
she
hesitated
but
after
all
she
might
be
fairly
sure
of
him
it
was
boldness
that
was
needed
in
dealing
with
such
reserve
and
boldness
that
de
pomponne
lacked
his
majesty
hath
much
influence
in
the
united
provinces
prince
she
raised
her
fan
to
her
lips
they
were
alone
in
the
antechamber
from
the
ballroom
they
could
be
observed
but
not
heard
the
prince
did
not
answer
more
influence
than
you
imagine
highness
believe
he
moved
but
did
not
look
at
her
her
eager
scrutiny
could
gain
nothing
from
his
pale
young
face
i
can
credit
it
madame
he
said
she
ventured
further
his
majesty
is
the
most
powerful
king
in
the
world
highness
and
if
he
wished
a
thing
done
no
one
could
successfully
oppose
it
may
very
well
be
his
majesty
is
your
very
good
friend
the
prince
kept
his
eyes
lowered
his
head
slightly
turned
from
her
scrutiny
the
duchess
continued
if
the
king
willed
your
restoration
prince
he
could
accomplish
william
answered
calmly
sometimes
de
witt
talks
to
me
of
politics
madame
and
from
him
i
learn
that
the
king
of
france
is
not
friendly
towards
the
united
not
towards
them
or
de
witt
she
answered
swiftly
but
towards
you
does
not
your
highness
understand
william
looked
up
now
scarcely
she
was
spurred
to
go
further
than
ever
de
pomponne
had
ventured
the
king
finds
the
united
provinces
in
his
way
as
you
do
highness
he
finds
as
you
do
that
de
witt
must
go
your
cause
is
one
with
his
majesty
s
say
so
and
the
thing
is
she
thought
but
could
not
be
sure
that
he
slightly
drew
himself
away
from
her
into
the
corner
of
the
settee
his
majesty
she
continued
has
the
power
to
put
you
where
your
father
was
and
afterwards
madame
asked
the
prince
how
should
i
repay
his
majesty
madame
lavalette
began
to
be
more
sure
of
her
ground
your
highness
she
said
softly
would
have
the
help
of
france
in
subduing
an
impudent
and
ungrateful
country
your
highness
would
be
master
of
holland
under
king
louis
added
the
prince
under
the
protection
of
france
highness
his
majesty
is
already
the
dictator
of
it
was
a
prospect
calculated
to
dazzle
one
powerless
and
ambitious
madame
lavalette
was
pleased
to
see
her
words
take
effect
the
prince
slowly
coloured
and
put
his
hand
in
an
agitated
manner
to
the
lace
on
his
breast
i
understand
you
now
he
gave
her
an
extraordinary
look
the
meaning
of
which
was
beyond
her
i
never
doubted
your
intelligence
prince
and
you
did
right
to
be
cautious
but
now
i
think
we
may
speak
more
m
de
pomponne
hath
hinted
at
this
i
do
more
than
the
dance
music
floated
in
from
the
truce
saloon
and
the
duchess
waving
fan
kept
time
to
the
slow
melody
you
have
but
to
let
his
majesty
know
your
sentiments
she
urged
william
sat
still
leaning
against
the
arm
of
the
settee
his
right
hand
resting
lightly
on
his
breast
his
eyes
were
dark
with
feeling
and
the
flush
still
lingered
in
his
cheeks
she
was
satisfied
that
she
had
touched
him
and
touched
him
deeply
with
some
curiosity
she
waited
for
him
to
speak
he
interested
her
a
smile
touched
her
lips
as
she
thought
of
the
gravity
of
their
converse
and
the
twenty
years
between
them
he
accepted
her
with
amazing
good
faith
in
some
things
he
must
be
very
simple
it
was
not
displeasing
to
her
to
reflect
that
she
was
the
same
to
him
as
the
irreproachable
dames
of
his
own
country
whose
velvets
swept
the
floor
in
the
ballroom
shall
not
de
pomponne
convey
some
message
of
duty
from
your
highness
to
his
majesty
she
asked
to
probe
his
silence
the
colour
deepened
in
his
face
madame
lavalette
wondered
why
his
majesty
would
not
value
the
duty
of
one
as
unimportant
as
myself
you
are
his
majesty
s
cousin
prince
and
he
would
restore
you
to
those
offices
de
witt
has
usurped
do
i
now
speak
open
enough
his
majesty
would
do
this
on
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
on
easy
perhaps
madame
i
should
find
them
outside
my
power
to
madame
lavalette
laughed
ah
no
his
majesty
thinks
of
a
french
match
for
you
she
sought
to
still
further
dazzle
him
he
will
restore
the
town
of
orange
in
exchange
for
the
liberty
of
the
united
provinces
interrupted
william
calmly
is
not
that
madame
the
price
if
you
will
put
it
so
bluntly
your
highness
then
the
prince
was
breathing
rather
quickly
there
is
one
it
can
be
overcome
she
answered
smiling
i
do
not
think
what
is
it
he
raised
his
beautiful
eyes
they
were
almost
unnaturally
dark
and
bright
i
am
a
calvinist
madame
he
said
gravely
madame
lavalette
dropped
her
fan
on
to
her
lap
well
she
questioned
his
majesty
is
of
the
romish
she
bent
her
head
it
is
not
a
religion
madame
beloved
in
the
united
she
made
an
effort
to
meet
him
in
this
new
position
we
do
not
talk
of
religions
his
eyes
narrowed
again
he
gave
her
that
inscrutable
glance
i
talk
of
mine
what
has
it
to
do
with
the
matter
in
hand
your
highness
to
her
further
bewilderment
he
smiled
with
composure
and
she
thought
a
touch
of
scorn
i
believe
madame
in
your
highness
is
confusing
me
with
leyden
logic
she
answered
it
is
not
this
we
are
speaking
of
it
affects
what
we
speak
of
she
bit
her
lip
how
highness
because
i
do
not
believe
madame
that
i
am
predestined
to
be
the
tool
of
the
king
of
france
the
princes
of
my
house
have
left
behind
them
records
that
teach
me
different
aims
and
higher
with
that
he
rose
the
pride
and
daring
of
this
speech
confounded
her
as
if
he
had
used
sudden
violence
the
colour
gathered
in
her
cheeks
and
her
blue
eyes
became
bright
and
hard
you
think
madame
that
i
am
impolitic
said
the
prince
who
had
now
easily
the
mastery
of
the
situation
but
while
i
am
the
subject
of
the
republic
it
is
you
who
are
impolitic
to
broach
to
me
my
cousin
s
she
rallied
herself
as
best
she
might
from
his
defiance
your
highness
surprises
me
are
you
wise
are
you
in
a
position
to
take
this
tone
to
the
king
of
france
william
put
his
hand
to
his
side
where
his
sword
should
have
been
i
am
grateful
for
his
majesty
s
private
friendship
but
he
mistakes
my
importance
in
the
state
you
should
go
madame
to
de
he
gave
her
a
glance
that
brought
a
flame
into
her
blood
bent
his
head
and
turned
away
madame
lavalette
sat
as
he
had
left
her
her
hands
either
side
of
her
on
the
settee
and
the
angry
red
in
her
face
in
a
few
moments
de
pomponne
came
up
seeing
him
she
rose
angrily
ah
madame
said
the
marquis
softly
you
have
been
no
more
successful
than
she
bit
her
full
he
will
not
burn
his
fingers
in
any
intrigue
that
boy
she
answered
and
you
are
a
fool
le
marquis
to
meddle
with
him
what
use
is
he
to
us
he
is
too
or
too
honest
a
calvinist
and
tells
me
so
here
quoted
his
house
mon
dieu
he
might
have
been
seventy
the
other
side
of
his
company
hath
frozen
me
and
heated
me
i
hate
him
take
me
home
de
pomponne
saw
she
was
unusually
angered
he
pursed
up
his
lips
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
the
prince
will
be
glad
of
the
offers
he
rejects
now
in
a
while
he
answered
she
swung
her
fan
to
and
fro
i
would
give
something
to
be
the
one
to
master
then
she
laughed
if
you
do
not
get
me
out
of
this
puritanical
country
de
pomponne
i
shall
die
of
the
prince
had
returned
to
amalia
of
solms
who
was
conversing
with
lady
temple
madame
he
said
abruptly
i
am
so
soon
her
voice
was
touched
with
dismay
lady
temple
moved
away
why
should
i
stay
asked
william
wearily
the
princess
changed
the
subject
what
of
madame
lavalette
i
saw
you
dance
with
her
she
is
very
beautiful
and
the
prince
answered
still
in
that
tired
absent
way
she
is
old
a
spy
of
louis
and
stale
at
the
the
princess
was
startled
both
at
his
clear
vision
and
his
calm
statement
oh
be
careful
she
whispered
i
know
no
other
word
for
spy
the
princess
rose
and
touched
her
grandson
s
shoulder
you
frighten
me
madame
lavalette
represents
the
prince
put
his
hand
to
his
forehead
and
answered
in
a
low
but
moved
tone
i
listened
to
what
she
had
to
she
insulted
me
like
every
his
eyes
flashed
bitterly
even
bromley
thinks
he
serves
the
puppet
of
and
you
madame
he
checked
himself
scornfully
but
let
it
i
do
not
understand
faltered
the
princess
no
one
understands
save
he
kissed
her
hand
she
made
confused
protest
but
he
left
her
without
further
ceremony
in
the
antechamber
the
prince
met
the
grand
pensionary
his
was
brief
de
witt
received
it
coldly
the
ball
was
in
honour
of
my
cousin
i
should
have
been
pleased
if
your
highness
could
have
danced
with
her
mynheer
i
was
in
no
mood
for
de
witt
too
proud
to
remind
him
that
he
had
danced
with
madame
lavalette
made
no
answer
and
the
prince
left
the
binnenhof
with
an
aristocratic
slowness
and
an
air
of
sombrely
contained
haughtiness
gaily
the
music
rose
over
the
splendid
company
mingled
with
it
was
the
sound
of
laughter
the
swish
of
silks
the
grand
pensionary
of
the
united
provinces
was
standing
apart
from
the
dancers
madame
de
lavalette
passed
him
with
a
deep
courtesy
old
the
spy
of
louis
and
stale
at
the
she
was
summing
herself
up
in
words
much
like
those
the
prince
had
used
her
smile
was
cynical
i
have
been
at
it
twenty
years
i
had
better
leave
youth
she
passed
down
the
stairs
william
had
just
descended
the
candlelight
on
her
white
shoulders
her
gleaming
fair
hair
and
the
long
pearls
in
her
ears
behind
her
went
de
pomponne
smiling
de
witt
looked
after
them
with
a
foreboding
expression
in
his
sad
eyes
the
count
de
montbas
in
his
resplendent
uniform
hitching
at
his
great
sword
joined
him
what
is
the
matter
mynheer
he
asked
in
a
tense
voice
de
witt
gave
a
start
i
what
do
you
mean
the
count
smiled
uneasily
you
are
disturbed
read
you
so
much
in
my
face
and
john
de
witt
caught
the
other
by
the
arm
and
walked
with
him
across
the
chamber
for
awhile
he
did
not
speak
for
there
had
fallen
on
him
a
bitter
sense
of
chilly
fear
it
seemed
that
the
music
had
stopped
and
the
candles
gone
out
he
shuddered
the
prince
he
said
did
you
mark
him
and
the
frenchwoman
his
fingers
tightened
on
de
montbas
arm
my
god
help
me
god
help
me
count
for
i
am
part
ii
the
prince
i
challenge
all
our
histories
to
produce
a
prince
in
all
respects
his
equal
i
call
the
differing
humours
interests
and
religions
of
the
world
to
witness
whether
they
ever
found
a
man
to
centre
in
like
he
might
have
raised
his
seat
upon
his
native
country
s
liberty
his
very
enemies
would
have
supported
him
in
those
pretences
but
he
affected
no
honours
but
what
were
freely
offered
him
there
or
and
his
ambition
that
was

william
fleetwood
bishop
of
asaph
chapter
i
the
return
of
florent
van
mander
bromley
was
watering
his
flowers
and
feeding
his
pigeons
and
singing
to
himself
a
snatch
of
an
english
song
as
he
moved
to
and
fro
in
the
pale
spring
sunshine
that
filled
his
little
room
in
the
palace
being
disturbed
by
the
entry
of
a
servant
he
turned
his
in
his
hand
and
ceased
his
singing
pardon
mynheer
it
is
bentinck
s
secretary
who
hath
arrived
at
the
palace
and
his
highness
being
abroad
he
wishes
to
see
matthew
bromley
reflected
m
bentinck
s
secretary
by
name
florent
van
mander
is
it
not
so
yes
then
bring
him
florent
van
mander
entering
immediately
had
a
pleasant
picture
of
the
englishman
standing
by
the
open
window
with
a
row
of
tulips
and
narcissi
showing
behind
him
on
the
sill
and
the
grey
and
white
pigeons
circling
above
the
gaudy
flowers
bromley
was
cordial
we
have
not
forgotten
each
other
mynheer
but
it
is
not
so
long
van
mander
closed
the
door
three
years
it
is
three
years
since
i
was
last
at
the
hague
he
said
jealously
and
three
years
of
big
events
conceded
bromley
but
where
is
bentinck
he
fell
ill
at
hertogenbosch
florent
spoke
briefly
and
i
left
him
there
in
his
cousin
s
house
he
sent
me
on
to
acquaint
the
prince
of
this
delay
bromley
emptied
his
can
threw
the
last
handful
of
grain
to
the
greedy
pigeons
and
closed
the
window
his
highness
will
be
disappointed
he
remarked
he
looked
cheerfully
at
florent
are
you
glad
to
have
left
berlin
i
am
glad
to
return
to
the
bromley
leant
against
the
window
frame
and
observed
him
he
could
find
no
change
whatever
in
him
florent
van
mander
appeared
as
formerly
an
alert
reserved
grave
young
man
a
dull
fellow
bromley
called
him
inwardly
the
prince
was
expecting
bentinck
he
said
m
bentinck
is
furious
at
the
mischance
that
keeps
him
he
was
glad
to
be
recalled
naturally
does
it
not
show
the
altered
position
of
the
prince
that
he
can
recall
him
bromley
moved
to
the
oak
overmantel
and
took
from
it
a
blue
pot
of
deep
red
tulips
that
he
placed
on
the
table
by
the
window
m
de
witt
is
still
grand
pensionary
he
remarked
and
this
country
is
still
a
republic
but
as
you
say
the
prince
s
position
has
since
he
obtained
the
seat
in
the
council
of
state
that
was
two
years
bromley
was
removing
the
dead
flowers
from
among
the
vivid
blooms
he
hath
taken
a
good
many
steps
since
the
whole
country
shouts
for
him
said
florent
it
seemed
to
me
that
in
every
village
i
passed
through
they
execrated
the
name
of
de
witt
but
will
you
obtain
me
an
audience
of
his
highness
i
bear
him
a
letter
from
the
englishman
raised
his
fair
face
from
the
flowers
the
prince
will
be
back
at
any
moment
i
think
and
he
glanced
at
the
clock
he
hath
gone
to
the
huis
ten
m
van
ghent
is
no
longer
governor
here
asked
florent
suddenly
bromley
smiled
the
prince
so
wearied
him
with
marks
of
his
dislike
he
petitioned
to
be
released
from
his
post
so
consulting
their
own
dignity
their
high
mightinesses
declared
his
highness
free
from
tutelage
i
m
glad
of
it
m
de
witt
opposed
it
of
of
course
repeated
bromley
carrying
the
tulips
back
to
the
mantelshelf
he
opposed
his
election
to
the
council
he
opposed
his
journey
to
england
on
what
grounds
bromley
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
a
manner
doubtless
he
feared
king
charles
would
win
the
prince
over
to
his
designs
and
certainly
if
flattery
and
gaiety
and
the
temptations
of
a
gorgeous
court
did
you
accompany
him
interrupted
florent
enviously
yes
we
were
fêted
for
three
months
but
the
king
and
the
courtiers
did
not
take
to
the
prince
he
was
too
austere
he
was
the
idol
of
the
people
though
added
bromley
who
had
a
light
indifferent
and
vague
way
of
referring
to
political
matters
but
he
saw
that
van
mander
was
interested
deeply
in
what
had
occurred
during
his
three
years
absence
from
the
hague
so
it
was
right
he
should
be
and
so
bromley
strove
honestly
and
with
some
difficulty
to
himself
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
m
de
witt
thought
the
prince
would
be
dazzled
he
explained
thrusting
his
hands
into
his
pockets
so
there
was
bad
feeling
over
that
and
then
there
was
the
seat
in
the
council
of
state
and
his
highness
salary
and
the
affairs
abroad
do
you
think
there
will
be
war
again
florent
broke
in
the
french
are
in
lorraine
already
de
witt
hath
passed
the
war
budget
and
is
striving
for
an
increase
of
the
army
yes
every
one
says
that
there
will
be
florent
coloured
france
provokes
it
wantonly
on
the
thinnest
pretexts
he
said
hotly
umph
bromley
slightly
grimaced
england
is
in
it
too
you
heard
of
course
of
the
treaty
of
dover
the
counter
stroke
to
the
triple
alliance
sir
william
temple
i
hear
hath
been
recalled
and
de
pomponne
downing
is
the
english
ambassador
florent
rose
what
does
the
prince
think
of
all
this
the
prince
is
striving
for
the
captain
will
he
get
it
i
can
not
tell
de
witt
opposes
it
with
all
his
power
he
sees
in
it
the
first
step
towards
the
restoration
of
the
stadtholdership
yet
nothing
less
will
content
the
army
and
the
florent
was
silent
he
did
not
like
bromley
shallow
he
thought
him
he
was
too
a
foreigner
his
own
eager
reflections
lay
too
deep
for
any
expression
he
saw
the
terrible
shadow
of
france
falling
over
his
country
distracted
by
the
agony
of
internal
nothing
could
save
them
they
would
be
subjects
of
louis
john
de
witt
had
no
more
power
to
prevent
well
the
prince
would
get
what
price
he
could
from
france
once
he
was
captain
general
and
he
florent
van
mander
must
follow
the
example
he
had
served
the
prince
in
the
person
of
bentinck
faithfully
for
three
years
it
would
be
remembered
to
his
credit
out
of
the
certain
ruin
facing
his
country
those
who
followed
the
prince
alone
could
make
easy
terms
with
he
was
startled
from
his
sombre
reverie
by
a
message
from
his
highness
the
prince
had
returned
and
would
see
the
messenger
from
bentinck
immediately
bromley
still
busy
with
his
flowers
nodded
carelessly
and
pleasantly
and
florent
was
led
to
the
apartment
where
the
prince
awaited
him
it
was
with
an
unreasonable
sense
of
agitation
that
he
came
into
william
s
presence
with
an
unnamable
feeling
of
excitement
that
he
looked
across
the
chamber
it
was
in
this
same
room
he
had
taken
leave
of
the
prince
three
years
ago
it
seemed
in
every
detail
unchanged
florent
recalled
the
precise
and
sombre
furniture
the
dark
walls
the
portrait
of
mary
stewart
princess
of
orange
above
the
mantelshelf
the
table
between
the
windows
covered
with
books
and
papers
the
shining
brass
fireirons
and
the
hearth
the
room
was
filled
with
the
hazy
february
sunshine
and
on
the
black
lacquer
cabinet
inside
the
door
stood
unexpectedly
a
bowl
of
white
and
yellow
narcissi
the
prince
was
standing
in
the
far
window
embrasure
with
his
back
towards
the
door
he
wore
a
velvet
suit
of
a
colour
he
affected
a
clear
violet
he
held
his
behind
his
back
and
the
sunlight
picked
out
bright
threads
in
the
long
hair
that
fell
between
his
shoulders
florent
closed
the
door
slowly
the
prince
turned
and
shot
him
a
keen
glance
ah
the
messenger
from
he
held
out
his
hand
for
the
letter
and
by
his
manner
it
seemed
that
he
had
forgotten
he
had
ever
seen
van
mander
before
m
bentinck
is
ill
at
hertogenbosch
highness
otherwise
he
would
be
here
in
william
took
the
letter
and
broke
it
open
bentinck
s
secretary
stood
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
eagerly
observing
the
master
whom
he
admired
blindly
and
did
not
understand
his
first
impression
was
that
william
had
changed
considerably
he
was
of
the
same
stature
having
come
early
to
his
full
height
but
of
a
more
robust
appearance
though
his
face
still
retained
a
look
of
delicacy
his
air
of
assured
his
expression
of
calm
gravity
had
deepened
he
had
always
been
sure
of
himself
now
he
wore
the
air
of
a
man
sure
no
less
of
others
sure
of
his
own
influence
to
sway
whom
he
would
to
his
will
he
had
lost
some
of
his
repression
it
seemed
was
no
longer
equally
on
his
guard
as
to
what
he
said
or
how
he
looked
as
he
stood
quietly
reading
his
letter
he
conveyed
a
personality
startlingly
masterful
and
daring
florent
felt
as
if
some
one
touched
him
gripped
him
so
strong
was
the
influence
of
the
slim
and
silent
figure
william
at
length
looked
up
his
face
had
slightly
altered
he
was
not
so
pale
the
curved
lips
were
set
firmly
in
an
expression
of
half
scorn
that
seemed
habitual
his
brilliant
eyes
were
controlled
to
an
unfathomable
austerity
and
the
peculiar
cleft
in
his
chin
was
more
noticeable
he
wore
slight
moustaches
in
the
french
style
that
added
to
his
age
and
was
dressed
for
riding
even
more
simply
than
florent
m
bentinck
is
not
seriously
ill
he
asked
no
highness
a
chill
a
slight
fever
when
will
he
be
able
to
come
to
the
hague
in
a
day
or
so
i
think
william
looked
again
at
the
letter
florent
did
not
know
how
to
face
the
disappointment
of
the
prince
s
total
forgetfulness
of
himself
his
three
years
exile
were
ill
repaid
by
again
the
prince
raised
his
eyes
are
you
pleased
to
return
to
the
hague
mynheer
van
mander
a
hot
flush
swept
across
florent
s
face
i
thought
your
highness
did
not
recall
i
recall
you
very
well
mynheer
bentinck
speaks
highly
of
you
if
you
choose
to
remain
in
my
service
it
is
open
to
you
florent
found
himself
foolishly
unable
to
frame
an
answer
he
had
felt
himself
slighted
and
now
he
was
shame
silenced
him
i
imagine
you
will
care
to
stay
said
william
eyeing
him
it
has
been
my
ambition
the
prince
put
the
letter
away
in
his
pocket
you
will
see
renswoude
who
is
now
head
of
my
household
i
need
another
secretary
i
will
speak
with
you
again
meanwhile
mynheer
i
thank
you
for
your
fidelity
to
florent
quivering
with
pleasure
bowed
low
the
prince
turned
to
the
table
between
the
windows
first
i
will
request
you
to
return
to
hertogenbosch
mynheer
with
a
letter
for
he
sat
down
wrote
hastily
in
a
large
flowing
hand
a
few
lines
and
sealed
them
in
a
cover
with
the
signet
on
his
thumb
as
he
rose
again
the
door
was
opened
highness
the
grand
pensionary
is
below
and
requests
an
immediate
it
seemed
to
florent
s
acute
observation
that
a
malicious
and
triumphant
expression
flashed
for
an
instant
in
william
s
eyes
but
he
answered
quietly
i
will
see
him
as
the
servant
withdrew
william
seated
himself
before
his
papers
again
handing
florent
the
packet
for
bentinck
return
as
soon
as
you
may
and
an
easy
journey
he
said
florent
bowed
himself
out
as
he
would
have
done
from
a
king
s
presence
flushed
with
a
high
beating
heart
and
well
repaid
for
those
tedious
three
years
in
berlin
william
watched
the
door
close
then
leant
back
in
his
chair
papers
drawings
plans
and
maps
were
scattered
before
him
some
of
the
drawers
of
the
cabinet
were
pulled
open
and
the
long
brass
handles
glittered
where
the
sun
caught
them
in
stars
of
gold
several
books
on
mathematics
and
geometry
were
piled
together
and
upon
them
was
placed
a
vase
in
the
shape
of
a
chinese
monster
holding
a
single
crimson
tulip
the
sun
slanting
in
through
the
long
window
caught
this
flower
and
picked
it
out
like
a
bell
of
blood
against
the
dusky
background
then
fell
full
on
the
thoughtful
figure
of
the
prince
outlining
it
in
a
misty
radiance
the
rest
of
the
room
was
golden
dark
for
the
heavy
curtains
were
half
across
the
windows
and
the
light
filtered
through
them
in
a
subdued
hue
so
that
de
witt
entering
the
chamber
had
his
attention
fixed
at
once
by
the
prince
and
the
tulip
the
objects
upon
which
all
the
sunshine
fell
with
every
day
now
de
witt
and
this
young
man
he
gazed
on
drifted
farther
apart
they
had
not
met
privately
for
months
william
turned
slowly
in
his
chair
and
rose
i
am
grateful
for
this
mynheer
he
said
and
it
was
the
manner
of
a
king
with
a
subject
for
i
wished
to
speak
to
the
grand
pensionary
advanced
into
the
room
he
was
splendidly
dressed
for
he
had
been
attending
the
second
reception
of
sir
george
downing
by
the
states
general
and
though
still
in
mourning
for
his
wife
his
black
was
put
aside
on
this
occasion
he
wore
a
crimson
mantle
embroidered
in
gold
and
a
coat
laced
and
beribboned
there
is
much
to
say
on
both
sides
highness
he
answered
gravely
the
prince
remained
erect
with
his
hand
on
the
back
of
his
chair
will
you
be
seated
de
witt
the
grand
pensionary
came
slowly
down
the
room
holding
his
velvet
mantle
across
his
breast
his
demeanour
was
stately
to
haughtiness
his
lips
unsmiling
and
his
eyes
severe
it
is
a
long
time
since
you
and
i
have
spoken
together
he
said
you
have
been
much
occupied
mynheer
replied
the
prince
he
continued
to
stand
mynheer
de
witt
seated
himself
in
a
deep
spanish
leather
chair
facing
the
window
but
enveloped
in
the
hazy
golden
dusky
shadows
it
is
not
preoccupation
hath
kept
me
away
said
the
grand
pensionary
but
distaste
to
broach
with
you
matters
on
which
we
can
not
agree
since
we
can
not
meet
as
friends
highness
it
is
painful
to
me
that
we
must
meet
at
why
not
as
friends
mynheer
asked
william
quietly
john
de
witt
looked
at
him
steadily
and
mournfully
because
there
is
no
friendship
in
your
heart
for
me
i
can
assure
you
that
you
mistake
me
i
am
capable
of
separating
the
man
and
his
office
i
am
one
with
my
office
answered
the
grand
pensionary
proudly
what
i
say
publicly
i
do
not
abate
one
jot
in
private
whilst
this
republic
chooses
me
as
its
representative
i
shall
serve
openly
and
with
all
my
power
the
liberty
and
independence
of
the
united
provinces
both
against
foreign
tyranny
and
native
is
this
a
threat
asked
william
i
do
not
use
those
weapons
i
have
come
here
because
i
have
had
rumour
of
many
things
thrust
upon
i
wish
to
hear
from
your
own
lips
what
you
intend
to
what
have
you
heard
of
me
from
others
questioned
william
he
looked
down
at
the
floor
john
de
witt
raised
his
head
a
little
m
fagel
beverningh
asperon
are
your
friends
or
followers
their
party
is
powerful
in
the
assembly
at
this
time
when
we
should
be
most
united
they
harass
and
thwart
the
government
at
every
turn
william
glanced
up
the
sunlight
full
across
his
face
you
can
easily
silence
this
faction
in
the
state
only
by
concession
the
prince
s
fair
hand
moved
slightly
on
the
carved
back
of
his
chair
you
have
come
to
accuse
me
of
causing
sedition
in
the
assembly
he
said
calmly
you
always
regarded
me
as
troublesome
he
smiled
faintly
however
what
i
have
to
say
to
you
touches
this
same
subject
the
welfare
of
the
state
highness
what
has
your
highness
to
say
to
me
you
know
mynheer
what
question
it
is
that
agitates
the
assembly
i
put
it
to
you
three
years
ago
and
you
refused
then
i
refuse
it
now
answered
john
de
witt
the
times
have
changed
remarked
william
laconically
but
i
have
not
replied
the
grand
pensionary
gravely
still
i
will
again
ask
you
mynheer
to
consent
to
my
appointment
to
the
captain
the
prince
picked
up
his
whip
from
among
the
papers
and
looked
at
it
as
he
spoke
the
angry
colour
rushed
into
john
de
witt
s
worn
face
my
answer
is
no
he
replied
sternly
and
i
am
surprised
at
these
presumptuous
the
whip
shook
a
little
in
william
s
hands
why
he
asked
speaking
slowly
by
reason
of
the
control
he
was
exercising
he
kept
his
eyes
still
on
the
whip
because
it
hath
been
decreed
by
law
a
law
that
i
have
sworn
to
that
all
discussion
even
of
your
election
to
this
office
be
deferred
till
you
are
are
you
going
to
stand
to
that
mynheer
i
am
i
hold
answered
john
de
witt
to
the
letter
of
the
william
raised
his
wonderful
eyes
and
yet
you
speak
of
you
have
always
opposed
me
always
he
pressed
his
handkerchief
to
his
lips
and
coughed
you
opposed
my
election
to
the
council
of
i
should
again
oppose
the
election
of
a
prince
of
eighteen
to
the
assembly
of
the
you
opposed
my
journey
to
england
continued
the
prince
because
you
thought
my
uncle
would
seduce
me
into
furthering
his
he
drew
a
quick
breath
and
looked
away
from
de
witt
is
it
because
you
still
have
such
suspicions
of
me
that
you
withhold
the
captain
generalship
there
was
an
instant
s
pause
before
the
grand
pensionary
answered
no
no
some
agitation
showed
in
his
voice
i
would
not
dishonour
myself
with
such
unworthy
thoughts
but
there
is
too
much
at
there
is
everything
at
stake
said
the
prince
the
very
existence
of
the
united
provinces
is
at
you
are
too
young
to
have
this
tremendous
responsibility
too
inexperienced
the
stadtholder
maurice
was
only
eighteen
when
he
took
command
of
the
army
flashed
the
prince
you
quote
an
unhappy
example
highness
prince
maurice
took
advantage
of
his
position
to
become
the
tyrant
of
the
william
looked
at
him
under
lowered
lids
you
speak
as
the
admirer
of
john
van
olden
barnenveldt
he
said
slowly
it
was
a
bold
and
dangerous
allusion
since
the
grand
pensionary
barnenveldt
had
perished
on
the
scaffold
for
opposition
to
the
power
of
the
stadtholder
maurice
i
john
de
witt
s
voice
was
cold
and
as
an
enemy
of
my
as
an
enemy
of
sovereign
power
in
your
house
william
laid
down
the
whip
you
mynheer
will
urge
the
assembly
to
refuse
me
the
captain
generalship
with
all
my
the
prince
bit
his
lip
and
his
lids
drooped
farther
over
his
brilliant
eyes
to
whom
does
the
assembly
intend
to
entrust
the
army
your
highness
knows
major
general
wurtz
the
prince
of
tarentum
the
viscount
de
those
are
your
men
they
are
the
tried
and
experienced
soldiers
to
whom
i
am
prepared
to
entrust
our
defences
if
god
refuse
us
the
peace
which
i
still
hope
william
half
turned
towards
him
peace
you
still
hope
for
peace
after
the
treaty
of
dover
after
the
invasion
of
lorraine
of
munster
and
cologne
after
downing
s
audience
of
the
states
his
insolent
demands
his
frivolous
complaints
peace
you
should
open
the
campaign
john
de
witt
replied
firmly
still
do
i
hope
to
avert
the
war
you
have
been
hoping
that
these
last
two
years
almighty
god
helping
me
i
shall
succeed
in
it
the
prince
s
eyes
flashed
impatiently
i
would
sooner
pray
almighty
god
to
help
me
drive
out
the
that
is
the
talk
of
selfish
ambition
answered
the
grand
pensionary
if
once
we
embark
on
a
war
with
france
and
england
only
a
miracle
can
save
us
he
gave
a
half
sigh
and
repeated
can
save
to
that
end
the
end
of
peace
you
make
i
have
been
forced
to
i
have
conceded
the
supremacy
of
the
seas
to
england
downing
had
his
answer
william
coloured
swiftly
that
acknowledges
this
country
subject
to
the
king
of
england
he
remarked
quickly
it
gives
us
prince
some
our
deliverance
lies
in
the
sword
said
william
shortly
untried
enthusiasm
speaks
there
answered
john
de
witt
not
unkindly
we
are
a
people
whose
prosperity
depends
on
peace
our
commerce
is
our
glory
and
our
wealth
we
have
shed
enough
blood
in
the
past
to
defend
now
we
are
prosperous
rich
free
and
powerful
to
years
of
peace
we
owe
a
war
would
be
disastrous
it
is
i
think
inevitable
struck
in
the
other
john
de
witt
half
smiled
sadly
does
your
highness
question
my
statesmanship
william
was
silent
a
moment
evidently
considering
how
he
should
shape
his
reply
the
sun
had
moved
so
that
it
fell
across
the
centre
of
the
floor
in
a
heavy
beam
of
gold
leaving
the
prince
in
shadow
i
think
that
the
war
budget
having
been
passed
a
year
ago
the
country
should
be
in
a
better
condition
to
resist
invasion
he
said
at
length
the
people
are
taxed
almost
beyond
endurance
two
forced
loans
have
been
raised
and
both
the
land
and
sea
forces
are
wretchedly
inadequate
i
do
not
know
who
is
responsible
for
these
things
he
coughed
and
looked
sideways
at
the
red
tulip
you
take
something
on
yourself
highness
returned
john
de
witt
to
say
this
to
my
face
it
is
an
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
criticise
you
mynheer
answered
the
prince
and
the
scornful
curve
to
his
mouth
was
now
noticeable
beyond
mistake
since
i
have
no
share
in
the
government
these
things
are
no
affair
of
mine
but
fagel
brought
me
your
book
de
witt
was
betrayed
into
hot
speech
gaspard
fagel
fawns
on
i
think
he
wishes
to
serve
me
returned
william
quietly
you
taught
me
finance
and
some
other
things
and
i
have
applied
your
lessons
to
your
practice
for
my
own
instruction
john
de
witt
looked
at
him
curiously
i
do
not
quite
understand
your
no
there
is
little
need
as
you
say
what
have
i
to
do
with
the
government
of
the
united
provinces
i
asked
your
influence
in
the
matter
of
the
captain
generalship
the
grand
pensionary
interrupted
haughtily
prince
i
can
no
longer
discuss
that
subject
under
no
conditions
will
i
be
party
to
giving
you
this
position
you
must
serve
before
you
can
command
know
something
of
war
before
you
can
be
put
over
men
like
wurtz
and
prince
john
maurice
montbas
and
the
prince
of
william
answered
keeping
his
glance
upon
the
papers
scattered
over
his
desk
i
know
enough
to
tell
you
mynheer
that
if
you
do
not
strengthen
the
frontier
the
french
will
cross
the
rhine
and
once
the
rhine
is
crossed
utrecht
falls
and
half
the
republic
is
you
speak
as
if
judging
me
remiss
in
my
duty
to
the
i
speak
from
my
conviction
it
hath
not
been
wholly
in
my
hands
answered
john
de
witt
with
a
stately
control
what
hath
been
done
hath
been
done
by
much
reflection
and
varied
advice
how
would
your
highness
have
it
different
it
were
very
idle
to
talk
of
what
i
can
not
perform
said
william
put
me
in
command
of
the
army
and
i
will
show
you
what
i
will
the
grand
pensionary
rose
with
a
glimmer
of
red
and
gold
never
he
said
firmly
the
prince
was
still
standing
his
hand
resting
on
the
back
of
his
chair
and
his
eyes
cast
down
his
very
quiet
conveyed
a
passion
and
a
determination
that
john
de
witt
felt
meeting
his
own
firm
resolve
iron
striking
iron
the
unyielding
strength
of
two
opposed
natures
brought
into
contest
mynheer
said
william
there
are
those
desirous
of
obtaining
me
this
appointment
i
have
as
you
say
some
friends
in
the
assembly
between
them
fell
the
gold
bar
of
sunshine
dancing
with
a
million
motes
each
saw
the
other
beyond
it
in
a
haze
of
dusky
shadow
you
intend
to
push
the
matter
to
extremes
asked
john
de
witt
their
eyes
met
have
you
come
to
request
me
not
to
returned
william
with
meaning
john
de
witt
coloured
at
the
tone
no
highness
he
answered
proudly
i
will
request
of
you
their
high
mightinesses
will
decide
between
us
said
william
with
a
stress
of
mockery
on
the
title
i
am
sorry
that
you
will
not
help
me
and
i
prince
am
sorry
that
you
should
have
asked
it
of
me
replied
the
grand
pensionary
with
a
mournful
dignity
it
makes
weightier
my
almost
intolerable
burdens
my
almost
crushing
duties
more
difficult
that
you
and
at
this
crisis
should
distract
the
state
with
your
pretensions
and
adopt
this
position
towards
william
again
lowered
his
eyes
he
seemed
to
be
considering
after
a
second
he
smiled
i
also
grieve
that
you
should
refuse
me
his
eyes
flashed
an
upward
glance
perhaps
it
is
not
wise
it
is
right
answered
de
witt
your
friendship
would
mean
much
to
me
but
i
can
not
purchase
it
at
any
such
price
we
are
both
too
obstinate
said
william
almost
insolently
there
is
no
need
for
more
talk
on
the
de
witt
gathered
up
his
mantle
good
even
to
your
good
even
the
grand
pensionary
regarded
him
with
a
touch
of
wistfulness
and
hesitated
a
moment
but
william
stood
motionless
obviously
waiting
for
him
to
leave
and
john
de
witt
turned
away
again
it
was
the
manner
of
a
sovereign
with
the
subject
the
prince
seated
himself
before
the
grand
pensionary
had
closed
the
door
the
smile
still
lingered
on
his
lips
he
took
a
letter
from
the
pocket
of
his
coat
and
slowly
unfolded
it
it
was
from
fagel
william
the
last
sentences
your
highness
affair
goes
well
in
the
assembly
de
witt
hath
but
little
influence
now
in
a
few
days
you
will
be
captain
general
since
both
general
wurtz
and
prince
charles
have
promised
to
refuse

the
office
be
offered
to
them

since
the
clamour
of
the
people
is
no
longer
to
be

ii
agneta
de
witt
did
you
see
the
prince
my
father
agneta
de
witt
dropped
her
fine
sewing
into
her
lap
and
looked
at
the
grand
pensionary
they
were
together
in
the
garden
under
the
new
golden
foliage
of
the
wych
elms
and
limes
the
air
was
filled
with
a
soft
and
melancholy
sunshine
the
trees
cast
faint
and
moving
shadows
over
the
figure
of
john
de
witt
who
leant
back
in
the
rustic
seat
and
his
face
resting
on
his
hand
gazed
at
his
daughter
i
saw
him
this
afternoon
i
thought
sir
that
you
and
why
the
grand
pensionary
smiled
agneta
fixed
her
pale
blue
eyes
on
him
anxiously
her
colourless
gentle
face
looked
pure
and
grave
as
an
infant
s
in
the
precise
white
cap
forgive
me
sir
but
it
is
because
you
have
seemed
i
am
tired
answered
john
de
witt
quietly
very
tired
his
daughter
turned
her
face
away
across
the
close
grass
came
a
couple
of
pigeons
white
on
the
green
and
the
two
on
the
seat
were
so
still
that
the
birds
strutted
to
their
feet
you
are
always
tired
now
i
can
expect
nothing
else
my
she
picked
up
her
sewing
and
you
are
so
seldom
here
you
have
not
sat
like
this
with
me
for
so
long
the
house
is
too
sombre
for
you
answered
john
de
witt
tenderly
you
must
return
to
dordt
no
breathed
agneta
quickly
looking
up
into
his
face
oh
no
let
me
stay
here
my
dearest
he
laid
his
fine
hand
lightly
on
her
shoulder
if
i
could
help
you
she
said
in
a
low
voice
there
is
no
help
for
us
save
in
god
answered
the
grand
pensionary
gravely
and
surely
he
will
not
forsake
agneta
bowed
her
head
low
over
her
sewing
the
white
pigeons
brushed
her
long
grey
skirts
with
their
wings
and
the
sunshine
flickering
through
the
lime
leaves
caught
the
pale
yellow
locks
on
her
smooth
brow
you
are
always
sad
when
you
have
seen
the
prince
father
i
think
he
is
an
ungodly
young
john
de
witt
smiled
mournfully
you
must
not
dwell
on
politics
i
can
not
help
she
kept
her
lids
down
that
her
father
should
not
see
her
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
i
i
hear
such
horrible
things
i
see
you
so
occupied
so
he
answered
her
with
a
grave
tenderness
we
are
in
troublous
and
bitter
times
dearest
danger
to
the
state
to
each
and
all
of
us
is
very
near
dismay
unmans
many
but
i
hope
to
save
the
republic
agneta
you
must
pray
that
god
will
give
me
i
am
praying
for
you
sir
in
my
heart
always
the
tears
trembled
on
her
cheeks
there
was
a
pause
the
pigeons
fluttered
away
and
up
through
the
sunny
leaves
will
there
be
war
agneta
spoke
at
length
under
her
breath
i
think
there
will
be
john
de
witt
s
gaze
went
past
his
daughter
as
if
it
rested
on
some
threatening
vision
of
the
future
she
shyly
wiped
her
tears
with
france
and
england
father
i
do
fear
it
she
shuddered
war
was
a
terrible
thing
to
her
but
still
more
terrible
was
the
anxious
bearing
of
her
noble
father
the
people
riot
sir
is
it
because
of
the
war
she
asked
timidly
it
is
the
prince
s
faction
he
answered
abstractedly
he
is
extraordinarily
beloved
by
the
people
he
hath
done
nothing
she
said
simply
why
do
they
riot
he
would
be
captain
general
and
it
may
not
a
colour
came
into
her
fair
face
i
fear
and
mislike
him
john
de
witt
turned
his
soft
gaze
on
her
nay
agneta
do
not
say
that
nor
think
once
more
the
white
linen
she
sewed
sank
into
her
lap
sir
the
other
day
on
the
voorhout
there
was
a
man
wearing
an
orange
favour
he
had
others
with
him
i
was
with
my
aunt
johanna
and
when
they
saw
us
these
men
they
called
after
us
insolently
my
aunt
johanna
asked
one
of
them
why
he
said
we
are
for
the
prince
and
you
are
john
de
witt
s
women
and
the
crowd
were
with
them
john
de
witt
frowned
and
coloured
you
never
told
me
no
perhaps
i
should
not
have
told
you
now
my
father
her
eyes
rested
anxiously
upon
his
face
but
the
prince
can
not
be
your
friend
he
hath
no
control
over
the
brawling
mob
answered
the
grand
pensionary
hastily
he
would
not
wish
me
to
be
i
must
make
an
example
of
some
of
these
rioters
an
example
he
repeated
agneta
put
her
little
hand
timidly
on
his
arm
sir
we
are
no
longer
beloved
in
the
hague
nor
at
dordt
they
say
such
things
of
you
there
she
checked
herself
they
had
all
agreed
to
keep
from
john
de
witt
what
his
growing
enemies
said
of
him
it
is
not
strange
he
answered
mournfully
but
it
is
strange
and
cruel
that
it
should
come
to
thy
ears
a
frightened
expression
stole
into
her
large
pale
blue
eyes
father
why
are
these
people
turning
against
you
nay
i
must
speak
of
it
fagel
is
no
longer
friendly
he
hath
elected
to
follow
the
and
and
there
are
dearest
very
many
forsake
me
but
god
will
support
me
in
what
i
have
to
will
will
my
uncle
cornelius
have
to
go
with
the
fleet
i
think
so
agneta
reflected
a
second
then
said
but
we
are
always
victorious
on
the
cornelius
and
the
others
agneta
will
do
their
utmost
to
preserve
this
dear
land
s
liberty
and
we
must
trust
in
my
uncle
cornelius
could
never
be
defeated
insisted
agneta
but
you
are
he
stroked
the
little
fingers
lying
on
his
sleeve
about
the
india
fleet
now
being
convoyed
home
de
ruyter
hath
gone
to
meet
it
but
i
am
anxious
sweet
would
the
english
attack
it
her
fair
brows
contracted
how
wise
thou
art
become
he
smiled
down
into
her
upturned
face
yes
i
do
fear
the
english
but
war
is
not
yet
declared
my
no
and
may
not
be
still
there
is
so
much
so
much
and
i
am
tired
dear
how
tired
i
only
know
when
i
rest
and
to
think
they
hate
me
ah
no
one
hates
you
she
cried
his
sad
smile
deepened
did
you
not
say
so
yourself
dear
heart
but
now
the
people
have
neither
trust
in
me
nor
love
after
twenty
years
of
toil
of
such
do
you
recall
agneta
how
they
repaid
olden
barnenveldt
father
he
was
a
virtuous
man
agneta
and
did
more
for
his
country
than
ever
i
have
been
able
to
she
went
very
pale
but
father
it
is
not
possible
what
dearest
m
olden
barnenveldt
was
beheaded
father
sometimes
i
think
of
it
when
i
crossed
the
plaats
agneta
shuddered
sir
do
not
speak
like
he
roused
himself
from
a
sad
reverie
nay
sweet
heart
i
must
not
grieve
thee
with
my
foolish
thoughts
tis
not
often
that
thou
beguilest
me
into
talking
state
affairs
here
where
i
am
at
he
glanced
with
a
sigh
round
the
quiet
garden
and
i
am
so
seldom
at
peace
now
i
am
a
very
fool
to
mar
it
we
will
talk
of
other
there
is
nothing
else
that
interests
me
that
must
not
be
see
how
i
have
distressed
thee
nay
do
not
spoil
my
little
hour
of
repose
with
these
tears
why
should
you
weep
indeed
i
am
well
only
tired
a
little
tired
nay
this
is
weakness
my
she
was
weeping
silently
my
burdens
are
not
more
than
i
can
bear
but
it
hurts
me
you
should
she
stifled
her
tears
i
think
of
you
always
sir
when
i
was
away
in
dordt
i
wearied
to
be
here
and
i
can
be
of
no
use
to
you
you
are
lonely
he
echoed
wistfully
agneta
trembled
closer
to
him
since
my
mother
he
took
her
hands
and
gazed
down
into
her
sad
face
thy
mother
was
very
gentle
and
timid
dearest
perhaps
she
was
spared
more
than
she
could
have
borne
perhaps
had
she
known
she
would
have
chosen
to
go
and
i
to
let
her
they
can
not
insult
her
she
died
while
her
name
was
still
ah
thou
art
a
beloved
child
and
hast
her
blessed
be
god
in
happiness
and
affliction
the
lord
gave
and
the
lord
taketh
away
he
drew
her
gently
towards
him
and
kissed
her
forehead
while
we
do
our
duty
we
can
not
be
wholly
unhappy
agneta
and
while
the
angels
are
about
us
we
can
not
be
lonely
not
wholly
the
sun
reddened
to
its
setting
and
a
full
and
ruddy
light
was
shed
among
the
quivering
leaves
and
over
the
spring
grass
the
chimes
of
the
groote
kerk
fell
on
the
silence
with
a
swift
clear
rise
and
fall
agneta
dropped
her
head
on
to
her
father
s
breast
and
sobbed
why
what
is
the
matter
he
asked
distressed
she
sprang
up
holding
her
hands
before
her
face
and
fled
leaving
her
white
sewing
on
the
grass
john
de
witt
sat
silent
his
form
half
bowed
his
head
bent
beside
agneta
s
place
rested
a
book
his
own
he
saw
the
value
of
life
annuities
as
compared
with
perpetual
the
book
of
which
the
prince
had
spoken
it
dealt
with
the
enormous
difficulty
of
the
war
taxation
a
monument
of
learning
of
research
of
patriotism
agneta
who
was
gravely
studying
mathematics
had
begged
a
copy
from
her
uncle
vivien
and
carried
it
about
with
her
it
touched
john
de
witt
exceedingly
to
see
it
there
had
she
been
reading
it
that
she
might
understand
his
learned
talk
of
the
means
by
which
he
had
saved
the
finances
of
the
united
provinces
poor
child
he
sat
for
a
while
staring
at
the
humble
little
volume
hands
and
brains
for
once
idle
the
sunset
flushing
the
garden
about
him
and
the
tender
breeze
caressing
his
face
when
he
at
length
slowly
moved
at
the
sound
of
a
step
on
the
gravel
path
he
saw
his
father
jacob
de
witt
coming
towards
him
with
the
careful
gait
of
age
the
grand
pensionary
rose
smilingly
jacob
de
witt
was
still
as
erect
as
when
he
had
defied
the
stadtholder
william
in
a
fine
and
sedate
gentleman
with
soft
white
hair
falling
under
his
black
cap
stern
melancholy
and
pale
sit
down
john
i
wish
to
speak
to
the
grand
pensionary
obeyed
the
elder
de
witt
despite
his
years
still
held
important
offices
of
state
and
had
the
manner
of
authority
he
seated
himself
beside
his
son
this
must
be
answered
he
said
he
held
out
a
paper
in
his
colourless
hand
another
pamphlet
john
de
witt
s
tone
was
mournful
father
they
are
distributed
openly
under
my
very
eyes
what
may
one
do
but
scorn
them
a
silence
followed
the
life
of
john
de
witt
had
been
austere
and
irreproachable
beyond
that
of
any
man
of
his
time
yet
his
father
knew
that
the
violence
of
party
hatred
was
holding
him
up
to
the
contempt
of
his
under
every
vile
aspect
imaginable
for
twenty
years
of
upright
dealing
of
pure
patriotism
of
incessant
toil
for
an
unswerving
devotion
to
his
friends
and
a
generous
and
unchanging
policy
of
conciliation
towards
his
enemies
he
was
now
rewarded
by
the
basest
ingratitude
from
the
opponents
he
had
always
respected
and
with
the
vilest
accusations
from
the
people
whom
he
had
so
nobly
served
these
things
were
in
the
mind
of
jacob
de
witt
as
he
looked
at
his
son
and
even
the
stern
resignation
taught
by
their
common
creed
hardly
sustained
him
against
these
bitter
calumnies
of
his
belovèd
s
name
john
de
witt
was
the
first
to
speak
why
should
we
trouble
about
these
things
he
took
the
pamphlet
from
his
father
s
hand
gently
and
laid
it
on
the
seat
between
them
the
elder
de
witt
s
voice
trembled
a
little
this
must
be
answered
my
son
every
citizen
of
the
united
provinces
is
reading
it
the
charges
are
most
gravely
and
categorically
stated
the
vileness
of
it
is
almost
beyond
the
grand
pensionary
half
turned
and
picked
the
pamphlet
up
it
was
entitled
to
every
good
and
faithful
what
do
they
say
he
asked
wearily
they
say
jacob
de
witt
drew
himself
erect
this
libel
says
that
you
have
purloined
money
from
the
treasury
and
sent
it
to
a
bank
in
venice
where
you
propose
to
retire
after
the
conquest
of
the
united
that
you
have
betrayed
your
country
by
leaving
it
without
defence
and
that
you
have
appropriated
yearly
eighty
thousand
florins
of
the
secret
service
john
de
witt
rested
his
tired
eyes
on
the
gentle
trees
how
can
i
answer
that
he
said
simply
the
mere
frothings
of
you
must
answer
it
you
must
disprove
it
cried
his
father
firmly
disprove
that
he
half
smiled
ay
a
villain
may
throw
mud
at
a
saint
said
jacob
de
witt
answering
his
son
s
meaning
of
lofty
contempt
but
if
it
is
not
removed
it
leaves
a
smirch
no
saint
even
may
disregard
these
things
what
hath
the
republic
come
to
that
any
should
dare
what
this
man
hath
dared
he
struck
the
paper
and
his
dim
eyes
flashed
fiercely
the
grand
pensionary
put
his
hand
to
his
brow
and
pushed
back
the
soft
hair
my
life
hath
been
entirely
my
money
hath
been
invested
entirely
in
the
public
funds
with
the
fortune
of
holland
my
fortunes
fall
every
one
knows
this
can
i
stoop
to
defend
myself
against
party
lies
your
silence
will
not
disarm
their
implacable
resentment
you
must
turn
on
ah
i
have
so
much
else
to
do
my
father
so
the
light
had
faded
from
the
garden
and
lingered
only
in
the
tops
of
the
trees
and
on
the
roof
of
the
modest
house
it
was
quite
warm
the
pigeons
flew
up
through
the
golden
air
in
among
the
leaves
of
the
limes
and
back
again
to
the
bright
grass
i
think
there
will
be
war
said
john
de
witt
suddenly
and
with
a
terrible
note
in
his
voice
i
would
god
would
let
me
give
my
life
to
avert
it
war
in
this
rich
and
prosperous
country
war
against
overwhelming
odds
he
stared
straight
before
him
with
narrowed
eyes
war
provoked
by
base
tyranny
of
the
french
and
baser
tyranny
of
the
english
what
have
i
to
do
for
they
hate
me
how
can
i
serve
them
when
they
hate
me
there
are
those
who
are
jacob
de
witt
grasped
his
son
s
hand
i
have
given
gaspard
fagel
the
grand
secretaryship
answered
john
de
witt
in
an
absorbed
way
to
win
him
to
us
but
on
every
side
they
fall
away
from
it
is
strange
that
i
should
be
so
hated
we
are
in
the
hands
of
god
who
for
his
own
ends
tries
the
younger
de
witt
bent
his
head
i
show
myself
a
weakling
i
am
tired
i
saw
the
prince
this
afternoon
and
it
saddened
me
i
have
been
disappointed
in
the
prisoner
of
loevenstein
answered
sternly
he
is
a
worldly
ambitious
and
deceitful
young
man
a
danger
to
the
state
little
do
i
doubt
he
is
in
league
with
charles
stewart
as
little
as
i
doubt
he
is
behind
such
attacks
as
he
struck
the
paper
on
the
seat
beside
him
i
believe
nor
one
nor
the
other
answered
john
de
witt
it
must
be
that
he
is
honourable
and
i
know
him
he
is
even
as
his
father
was
the
captain
generalship
is
his
claim
now
and
he
is
well
if
he
obtain
it
twill
be
the
first
step
to
the
if
i
have
any
power
left
father
he
will
not
obtain
it
and
if
he
obtain
it
in
spite
of
me
he
will
find
that
the
office
is
incompatible
with
the
john
de
witt
set
his
lips
firmly
i
have
seen
to
he
hath
an
extraordinary
presumption
to
pretend
to
such
an
office
the
grand
pensionary
answered
slowly
almost
reluctantly
i
believe
it
is
the
wish
of
the
army
such
is
their
they
are
very
eager
to
forge
their
own
chains
said
jacob
de
witt
grimly
it
is
a
strange
thing
i
think
it
is
the
name
hath
the
glamour
they
would
take
him
john
de
witt
paused
a
moment
then
went
on
in
a
low
and
laboured
voice
there
are
so
many
difficulties
a
domestic
revolution
threatened
a
foreign
invasion
but
if
they
trusted
me
i
could
save
them
yet
from
france
and
from
he
straightened
himself
and
put
his
hand
to
his
breast
if
they
should
give
this
command
to
the
prince
if
they
should
put
into
that
boy
s
hands
all
our
defences
and
he
play
us
false
finished
jacob
de
witt
sombrely
well
what
then
what
then
ruin
this
land
that
we
have
made
one
of
the
greatest
in
the
world
would
be
a
fief
of
france
before
the
year
is
he
bent
his
head
for
a
moment
then
rose
abruptly
father
i
envy
cornelius
who
can
work
with
his
hands
and
pay
with
his
blood
i
would
i
might
face
the
enemy
on
the
high
sea
nor
stay
here
to
face
the
factions
with
weary
your
task
being
the
more
difficult
is
the
more
glorious
the
grand
pensionary
pressed
his
hand
to
his
brow
and
gazed
at
the
glimpses
of
fading
sky
to
be
seen
between
the
fluttering
leaves
it
is
nearly
twenty
years
since
i
took
up
this
responsibility
they
can
not
say
that
i
have
served
them
ill
as
far
as
my
abilities
went
he
roused
and
controlled
himself
it
is
not
often
that
i
talk
so
weakly
let
us
go
into
the
house
it
grows
cool
here
under
the
jacob
de
witt
rose
and
took
his
son
s
arm
they
were
both
of
a
height
tall
upright
dressed
alike
in
black
with
lace
collars
the
same
in
demeanour
and
expression
the
grey
locks
touching
the
brown
as
they
walked
slowly
through
the
twilight
that
was
gradually
falling
over
the
garden
the
birds
made
a
pleasant
noise
in
the
upper
branches
and
above
the
low
brick
wall
was
a
vision
of
sunset
clouds
pink
remote
and
peaceful
floating
across
the
placid
sky
agneta
de
witt
stepped
out
of
the
long
open
windows
a
slim
and
pale
figure
in
the
uncertain
light
she
came
to
meet
her
father
aunt
johanna
says
that
you
stay
out
too
late
sir
and
that
it
is
yet
over
soon
in
the
year
to
be
abroad
after
the
sun
hath
all
traces
of
tears
had
vanished
she
spoke
with
a
grave
air
of
wisdom
jacob
de
witt
smiled
at
her
hast
a
letter
there
she
held
it
out
eagerly
yea
sir
from
from
anna
repeated
john
de
witt
tenderly
what
does
she
say
that
she
is
coming
home
nay
that
cuts
her
holiday
too
she
says
she
is
resolved
to
come
and
what
else
dearest
oh
she
says
my
aunt
maria
took
her
to
the
fair
at
dordt
and
that
they
had
a
feast
of
pancakes
and
all
drank
your
health
twice
she
slipped
her
letter
into
the
grand
pensionary
s
hand
there
is
one
for
you
indoors
she
added
they
entered
the
house
by
the
windows
of
the
library
at
that
moment
a
servant
brought
in
the
candles
and
the
two
men
paused
on
the
threshold
of
the
room
at
a
lacquered
chinese
cabinet
maria
de
witt
in
a
prim
white
dress
sat
on
a
high
chair
her
feet
dangling
laboriously
and
gravely
writing
with
a
huge
quill
that
waved
over
her
shoulder
and
tangled
itself
with
her
yellow
curls
beside
her
tiptoeing
that
he
might
see
was
her
little
brother
who
supported
himself
by
his
hands
on
the
desk
a
child
still
in
skirts
sat
on
the
floor
near
them
he
was
in
red
fastened
to
a
heavy
and
appeared
to
be
engaged
in
working
his
feet
out
of
his
shoes
agneta
pursed
up
her
mouth
maria
can
not
write
because
john
spills
the
ink
he
spoilt
my
letter
to
uncle
cornelius
this
the
grand
pensionary
caught
his
breath
and
turned
away
quickly
to
the
mantelshelf
he
leant
there
looking
down
into
the
empty
hearth
father
maria
lifted
a
flushed
face
how
do
you
spell
trouble
john
de
witt
glanced
up
and
gazed
at
her
what
need
hast
thou
for
that
word
maria
she
is
very
ignorant
said
her
brother
scornfully
i
know
how
to
spell
it
and
he
struggled
to
wrest
the
pen
from
her
thou
needest
not
use
the
word
trouble
to
thy
uncle
said
jacob
de
witt
i
write
there
is
much
trouble
at
the
hague
is
it
not
true
father
yes
dearest
he
answered
gently
agneta
will
tell
thee
how
to
spell
know
insisted
the
younger
john
the
grand
pensionary
met
his
father
s
glance
across
the
room
that
was
now
filled
with
the
pleasant
candlelight
then
crossed
to
the
child
on
the
floor
and
stood
him
up
thou
art
almost
too
old
for
petticoats
he
smiled
the
little
jacob
looked
at
him
and
smiled
back
brilliantly
john
de
witt
dropped
on
one
knee
beside
him
and
agneta
came
and
stood
behind
them
uneasy
because
her
brother
s
jacket
was
crumpled
and
to
her
housewifely
eye
untidy
but
the
boy
s
father
did
not
notice
that
he
smoothed
the
fair
curls
with
a
gentle
hand
i
think
thou
hast
grown
since
i
saw
thee
last
he
said
yearningly
with
a
sudden
shyness
the
child
hid
his
face
on
the
grand
pensionary
s
shoulder
john
de
witt
pressed
him
close
there
was
silence
in
the
room
save
for
the
scratching
of
maria
s
quill
jacob
de
witt
seated
himself
in
his
usual
place
by
the
hearth
his
hands
clasped
in
his
lap
his
bible
was
on
the
table
by
his
side
with
dim
but
resolute
eyes
he
looked
on
at
his
son
and
his
son
s
children
and
in
his
heart
he
gave
thanks
to
god
for
his
noble
offspring
john
de
witt
was
such
an
one
as
the
pure
faith
might
be
proud
of
one
who
had
followed
in
the
footsteps
of
the
early
members
of
a
stern
and
persecuted
faith
one
such
as
jacob
de
witt
would
have
his
son
an
upright
and
humble
servant
of
high
things
very
far
away
seemed
the
clamour
of
the
factions
the
rumours
of
wars
the
jealousies
the
ambitions
the
heat
of
politics
very
far
from
this
peaceful
home
of
john
de
witt
neither
did
it
seem
possible
that
hate
or
malice
should
enter
here
that
lies
or
calumny
or
any
ignoble
passions
should
strike
at
such
goodness
and
such
innocence
the
vilest
must
love
john
de
witt
the
meanest
respect
him
in
his
simple
bereaved
and
united
home
his
helpless
children
were
not
more
spotless
more
free
of
dishonour
than
he
who
for
twenty
years
had
guided
a
great
nation
through
a
difficult
and
perilous
way
and
how
are
they
rewarding
him
thought
jacob
de
witt
grimly
how
are
they
rewarding
him
into
the
gathered
peace
and
silence
came
a
distant
ominous
sound
the
grand
pensionary
listened
the
noise
grew
he
put
down
his
little
son
and
rose
what
is
that
agneta
shuddered
another
riot
close
the
window
said
john

close
the

iii
scheveningen
the

drew

at

he
said
the
englishman

their
noble

i
trust
that

remarked
the
prince
and
bromley
have
you
discovered
the
whereabouts
of
triglandt
highness
i
wrote
to
utrecht
i
wrote

interrupted
william
impatiently
and
my
letter
was
returned
as
triglandt
had
left
his
highness
i
have
discovered
that
he
fell
ill
ill
exclaimed
the
prince
and
was
conveyed
by
relatives
to
arnheim
well
you
will
write
there
and
give
him
my
commands
to
return
to
the
william
flung
the
reins
to
his
groom
and
dismounted
you
may
add
he
continued
that
i
take
the
first
occasion
to
ask
his
return
and
that
any
friend
of
mine
is
honoured
in
the
hague
he
smiled
with
his
eyes
and
touched
bromley
on
the
arm
with
his
whip
tell
them
to
keep
the
horse
as
afterwards
i
am
promised
at
the
huis
ten
then
he
turned
slowly
into
the
house
gaspard
fagel
a
man
of
talents
but
a
servile
spirit
the
rival
of
de
witt
and
already
almost
completely
under
the
influence
of
the
prince
waited
in
the
library
or
the
chamber
that
served
for
such
the
room
where
van
mander
had
first
seen
the
prince
and
where
william
always
received
such
as
waited
on
him
the
prince
entered
booted
spurred
carrying
his
and
wearing
his
hat
ah
he
held
out
his
bare
right
hand
and
the
secretary
of
the
republic
kissed
it
humbly
william
did
not
uncover
but
his
manner
was
gracious
he
knew
gaspard
fagel
for
what
he
was
able
industrious
cunning
a
man
who
would
be
a
tool
it
was
men
just
such
as
he
that
william
needed
there
were
many
of
them
among
the
servants
of
the
republic
and
very
few
had
resisted
the
advances
of
the
heir
of
nassau
i
must
congratulate
you
personally
on
your
appointment
fagel
said
the
prince
seating
himself
in
front
of
the
desk
between
the
windows
your
highness
is
very
good
and
fagel
bowed
he
was
a
man
richly
dressed
in
green
and
gold
of
a
far
more
pompous
appearance
than
william
who
wore
a
plain
brown
roquelaure
and
beaver
you
come
from
the
assembly
mynheer
yes
highness
to
report
to
you
privately
the
resolution
that
will
be
made
public
will
you
not
be
seated
mynheer
fagel
obeyed
and
fixed
his
small
intelligent
eyes
keenly
and
half
anxiously
on
the
prince
the
early
morning
sunshine
was
pale
and
misty
in
the
chamber
william
sat
with
his
back
to
the
light
his
hat
and
heavy
feather
shading
his
face
so
that
the
astute
secretary
could
very
ill
see
his
countenance
there
has
been
a
most
fierce
fight
in
the
assembly
highness
de
witt
exerted
every
nerve
and
the
whole
power
of
the
government
was
brought
to
bear
on
the
but
i
believe
my
friends
were
in
the
majority
mynheer
answered
william
it
was
an
almost
equal
struggle
highness
de
witt
spoke
for
two
hours
against
your
appointment
jacob
de
witt
vehemently
seconded
him
vivien
supported
them
and
they
found
allies
in
the
representatives
of
william
bent
his
whip
across
his
knee
the
powerful
city
had
always
been
the
enemy
of
his
house
fagel
wiped
his
brow
and
his
lips
he
had
been
up
all
night
and
looked
excited
and
fatigued
what
was
the
result
of
this
debate
asked
the
prince
quietly
the
secretary
crushed
his
handkerchief
up
in
his
nervous
right
hand
it
has
been
decided
to
offer
your
highness
the
captain
generalship
without
restrictions
mynheer
that
was
impossible
we
had
to
come
to
a
compromise
with
de
the
prince
s
grasp
tightened
on
his
whip
what
compromise
mynheer
fagel
whose
one
object
was
to
obtain
the
favour
of
the
head
of
the
orange
party
winced
at
the
tone
of
this
question
your
highness
must
consider
he
began
william
cut
him
short
tell
me
straightly
the
secretary
bit
his
lip
uneasily
we
have
obtained
for
your
highness
on
condition
that
you
take
the
oaths
never
to
attempt
the
stadtholdership
m
van
odyk
told
me
of
that
precaution
of
de
witt
i
have
no
objection
mynheer
he
who
binds
can
on
this
condition
and
provided
war
is
declared
their
noble
mightinesses
will
offer
you
the
captain
generalship
for
one
campaign
with
option
to
continue
the
appointment
or
no
at
their
for
one
campaign
repeated
william
it
was
all
highness
that
our
utmost
endeavours
could
fagel
spoke
with
humility
william
rose
abruptly
their
noble
mightinesses
may
spare
themselves
this
offer
mynheer
he
said
hotly
for
i
shall
refuse
the
your
highness
the
prince
turned
on
him
the
whip
clenched
in
his
right
hand
unless
the
appointment
is
made
for
life
i
shall
refuse
it
and
i
marvel
mynheer
that
you
should
come
to
me
with
so
paltry
a
your
highness
will
not
be
wise
to
reject
it
your
firmness
will
only
further
anger
de
witt
who
was
with
difficulty
brought
to
this
if
you
permit
the
assembly
to
make
this
offer
it
will
be
declined
returned
william
haughtily
you
may
tell
my
friends
so
i
will
not
be
put
on
trial
nor
be
satisfied
with
such
a
poor
fagel
saw
in
this
a
proud
indiscretion
of
youth
the
dignity
that
the
prince
despised
had
been
wrung
from
john
de
witt
with
much
labour
to
refuse
it
fagel
a
man
of
cautious
policy
thought
unwise
and
dangerous
your
highness
will
think
of
this
william
interrupted
my
decision
is
made
fagel
i
shall
not
depart
from
the
secretary
ventured
to
protest
the
advice
of
your
friends
no
one
s
advice
mynheer
would
alter
my
fagel
was
twice
the
prince
s
age
and
an
experienced
statesman
but
he
was
dominated
by
william
utterly
john
de
witt
and
some
few
others
were
alone
in
coming
in
contact
with
the
prince
and
escaping
his
powerful
masterful
influence
fagel
a
man
in
every
way
his
inferior
he
almost
openly
despised
there
is
not
a
man
in
the
united
provinces
does
not
desire
my
election
he
said
the
people
are
with
me
their
high
mightinesses
had
better
beware
tell
the
assembly
no
compromise
will
be
accepted
he
was
breathing
fast
and
with
difficulty
it
was
obvious
that
he
was
unusually
angry
and
unusually
near
to
losing
his
he
coughed
and
took
a
quick
turn
about
the
room
holding
his
hand
to
his
side
i
am
sorry
that
we
have
disappointed
your
highness
said
fagel
already
stung
into
regretting
that
he
and
his
party
had
been
induced
into
giving
way
to
the
opposition
of
de
witt
go
back
and
do
better
answered
william
with
a
flashing
glance
are
you
afraid
of
the
grand
pensionary
and
his
supporters
i
have
the
people
you
and
john
de
witt
had
best
remember
it
i
did
what
i
could
to
serve
your
what
you
could
when
you
bring
this
to
me
fagel
strove
to
justify
himself
the
prince
silenced
him
haughtily
is
this
a
moment
to
show
timidity
when
de
witt
carries
it
with
a
firm
front
if
you
had
not
given
way
he
had
been
forced
to
i
have
both
general
wurtz
and
prince
charles
prince
john
maurice
and
de
ruyter
on
my
fagel
could
not
forget
that
john
de
witt
was
still
the
head
of
the
government
a
compromise
he
began
his
smooth
voice
and
the
word
he
used
stung
the
prince
into
a
rare
exhibition
of
temper
he
turned
violently
with
dark
fierce
eyes
and
the
whip
bent
double
in
his
hand
be
damned
to
your
compromise
he
cried
john
de
witt
and
the
chaffering
tradesmen
who
support
him
will
have
the
french
across
the
rhine
before
the
army
is
under
canvas
i
ll
have
none
of
your
cursed
ifs
or
buts
tis
all
or
they
save
he
snatched
up
his
glove
from
where
he
had
flung
it
on
his
entry
that
is
my
answer
fagel
he
said
passionately
and
any
remonstrance
on
the
matter
i
shall
consider
an
the
secretary
bowed
he
knew
what
de
pomponne
had
discovered
that
the
prince
was
tolerably
firm
and
tolerably
positive
and
once
he
hath
taken
his
resolution
to
argue
with
him
is
waste
he
was
aware
also
that
what
william
wished
he
began
to
obtain
and
that
the
expression
the
country
is
with
me
was
no
figment
of
speech
the
united
provinces
were
behind
william
of
orange
and
to
the
rising
power
the
prudent
statesman
made
his
court
he
already
had
learnt
something
of
the
character
of
the
prince
he
intended
to
serve
already
guessed
at
something
of
the
imperious
passion
behind
the
contained
exterior
now
he
had
proof
of
it
and
it
spurred
and
stimulated
him
he
bore
not
the
least
to
william
for
his
anger
it
seemed
that
the
prince
was
one
of
those
who
are
served
and
beloved
without
effort
on
their
part
fagel
was
more
eager
than
ever
to
please
him
in
common
with
many
others
the
chance
of
william
s
taciturn
thanks
was
more
to
him
than
the
certainty
of
de
witt
s
courteous
graciousness
we
will
do
our
best
highness
he
said
rising
from
his
chair
william
gave
him
a
not
wholly
pleasant
glance
reflect
on
what
i
have
said
fagel
he
answered
haughtily
with
that
he
flung
open
the
door
and
was
gone
bromley
waiting
in
the
doorway
in
case
his
attendance
was
required
fell
back
at
once
before
the
sight
of
his
master
s
face
as
the
prince
swept
out
into
the
sunlight
the
groom
brought
up
the
grey
horse
shall
i
accompany
your
highness
ventured
bromley
no
i
am
not
going
to
the
huis
ten
the
prince
sprang
into
the
saddle
and
caught
up
the
reins
matthew
bromley
who
knew
him
as
well
as
any
man
was
permitted
to
saw
that
he
was
in
a
passionate
see
fagel
out
of
the
house
and
get
out
of
the
way
the
horse
mettlesome
and
fierce
like
all
the
prince
s
animals
had
grown
restive
with
waiting
and
tossed
his
head
impatiently
but
william
held
him
in
with
an
ease
that
betrayed
a
good
deal
of
strength
behind
his
delicate
appearance
stand
out
of
the
way
he
repeated
addressing
bromley
and
the
groom
is
your
highness
going
alone
the
prince
thrust
his
whip
under
his
arm
and
scowled
at
the
speaker
in
a
fashion
that
warned
bromley
to
be
silent
but
the
englishman
disturbed
at
this
rare
passion
on
his
master
s
part
persisted
where
are
you
going
sir
is
there
no
message
william
turned
in
the
saddle
to
look
at
him
i
have
allowed
you
too
much
license
he
said
violently
but
by
god
i
am
master
among
my
own
matthew
bromley
stepped
back
and
the
prince
let
the
horse
go
it
sprang
forward
and
william
disappeared
through
the
palace
gates
without
troubling
where
he
went
he
turned
towards
the
outskirts
of
the
town
with
the
one
idea
of
avoiding
the
people
he
was
fast
becoming
a
popular
hero
but
he
never
loved
the
crowd
save
in
the
abstract
all
public
display
of
affection
was
distasteful
to
him
and
he
was
too
roused
and
angry
to
risk
the
chance
of
meeting
either
de
witt
or
any
member
of
the
assembly
he
had
been
defeated
bitterly
disappointed
he
was
well
used
to
taking
both
defeat
and
disappointment
but
this
time
his
passion
had
slipped
his
control
his
bitter
indignation
against
de
witt
must
find
some
vent
if
it
were
only
a
fierce
gallop
out
of
the
hague
he
found
himself
on
the
klinker
paved
road
edged
with
a
double
row
of
straight
trees
it
led
to
scheveningen
and
with
a
quick
memory
of
the
sea
he
turned
towards
the
coast
the
hour
was
still
early
and
a
frail
sunshine
quivered
in
the
foliage
and
over
the
that
stretched
either
side
the
road
through
the
blue
haze
of
the
damp
morning
rose
the
tall
dark
forms
of
windmills
with
still
sails
poised
against
the
delicate
sky
and
the
clean
brickwork
of
farms
green
shuttered
and
ornamented
with
lines
of
white
the
black
and
white
cattle
carefully
covered
with
brown
coats
were
grazing
in
the
long
rich
fresh
grass
here
and
there
a
villa
stood
back
among
the
trees
with
painted
shutters
open
on
treasures
from
the
east
a
glowing
carpet
a
chinese
bowl
or
a
gaudy
macaw
chattering
in
an
ebony
ring
the
prince
slackened
his
pace
everything
about
him
showed
wealth
peace
and
complete
prosperity
the
great
dangers
looming
on
land
and
sea
cast
no
shadow
here
was
a
country
to
be
given
to
the
conqueror
here
was
a
rich
and
fertile
kingdom
for
the
insolent
french
to
batten
william
gazed
round
with
absorbed
and
resolute
eyes
as
his
horse
s
hoofs
rang
out
on
the
klinkers
in
slackened
beat
there
were
few
people
abroad
and
the
prince
being
unattended
and
attired
like
an
ordinary
gentleman
escaped
notice
this
fact
and
the
novel
sense
of
absolute
freedom
served
to
dispel
his
he
had
been
solitary
of
soul
all
his
life
and
so
used
to
loneliness
that
he
did
not
give
it
a
name
but
he
had
always
been
surrounded
by
enemies
watched
spied
upon
and
forced
to
weigh
every
word
and
every
look
this
sheer
liberty
of
solitude
was
pleasant
as
it
was
new
he
cleared
the
houses
and
the
trees
and
came
out
on
to
the
dunes
low
sand
hillocks
grown
with
scant
poplar
shrubs
avoiding
the
village
of
scheveningen
the
prince
took
the
winding
road
that
led
direct
to
the
sea
after
a
while
the
shrubs
ceased
and
there
was
no
growing
thing
only
the
low
rolling
billows
of
dry
white
sand
pierced
with
withered
and
broken
reeds
william
rode
slowly
along
the
diminishing
road
and
cresting
a
sandy
ridge
came
in
sight
of
the
immense
stretch
of
quiet
grey
sea
breaking
in
a
curling
line
of
foam
on
the
desolate
shore
to
his
right
only
a
few
yards
above
mark
stood
a
small
church
with
a
tiled
roof
the
steps
were
half
buried
in
sand
and
up
to
the
very
door
the
gaily
painted
were
drawn
behind
and
beyond
were
the
dunes
broken
only
by
the
few
houses
of
scheveningen
to
the
left
the
prince
drew
a
deep
breath
of
pleasure
at
the
pure
salt
air
at
the
quiet
dunes
and
the
misty
sea
whose
waves
broke
regularly
with
a
strong
falling
sound
he
guided
his
horse
over
the
shifting
sand
towards
the
church
and
as
he
neared
it
his
keen
glance
perceived
an
old
man
seated
on
the
edge
of
one
of
the
boats
mending
tawny
nets
a
great
flight
of
graceful
chattering
a
strong
flashing
white
in
the
pale
sunshine
rose
up
as
the
horseman
disturbed
their
solitude
and
flew
out
across
the
waveless
sea
the
fisher
was
roused
too
by
the
unusual
sound
of
jingling
harness
he
looked
up
and
seeing
a
gentleman
riding
slowly
across
the
sand
the
while
he
gazed
thoughtfully
out
to
sea
he
dropped
his
net
and
stared
he
was
used
to
gentlefolk
from
the
hague
but
not
so
early
in
the
year
as
this
the
horse
william
rode
was
magnificent
of
a
flemish
breed
a
stone
grey
and
shining
like
polished
granite
he
wore
the
least
possible
harness
and
his
full
intelligent
eyes
were
uncovered
he
arched
his
neck
and
trod
daintily
into
the
sand
that
shifted
under
his
hoofs
the
fisherman
stared
stolidly
at
the
horse
then
lifted
his
eyes
to
the
rider
he
beheld
a
slight
young
man
in
a
brown
greatcoat
and
a
rough
beaver
with
a
black
feather
black
velvet
breeches
and
waistcoat
and
a
plain
cravat
of
frisian
needlework
his
face
was
turned
towards
the
sea
and
only
his
heavy
auburn
hair
was
visible
under
his
hat
the
fisherman
turned
his
attention
again
to
the
horse
as
the
more
interesting
of
the
two
then
suddenly
the
prince
turned
and
looked
at
him
the
fisherman
doffed
his
cap
good
morning
good
morning
answered
the
prince
and
swerved
the
horse
towards
the
and
the
church
we
have
no
wind
said
the
fisherman
picking
up
his
net
william
was
observing
him
he
was
a
stout
man
clad
in
huge
dark
blue
breeches
a
striped
turquoise
coloured
shirt
woollen
hose
heavy
wooden
sabots
and
a
round
red
cap
his
throat
was
covered
by
an
emerald
green
scarf
he
held
a
thick
pipe
between
his
lips
and
on
a
finger
of
his
left
hand
shone
a
large
gold
ring
he
surveyed
the
prince
with
a
calm
curiosity
we
do
not
see
many
strangers
at
scheveningen
he
remarked
as
early
as
no
the
prince
assented
yet
it
is
very
pleasant
have
you
come
from
the
town
mynheer
he
indicated
the
hague
by
a
jerk
of
his
thumb
over
his
shoulder
even
i
was
up
there
last
william
said
nothing
but
he
did
not
look
forbidding
there
was
a
riot
continued
the
fisherman
with
a
kind
of
reserved
interest
there
often
it
was
outside
the
i
heard
of
the
people
were
shouting
against
de
it
is
not
the
fisherman
looked
up
from
his
net
are
you
a
soldier
mynheer
at
present
i
am
merely
a
private
citizen
but
i
think
i
shall
some
day
be
a
the
man
shifted
his
pipe
between
his
teeth
if
there
is
war
mynheer
yes
if
there
is
the
fisherman
nodded
approvingly
we
shall
all
need
to
be
soldiers
if
we
want
to
keep
the
french
out
william
delicately
guided
his
horse
a
little
nearer
i
should
like
to
go
into
the
well
it
is
open
at
this
the
prince
dismounted
where
can
i
secure
my
horse
he
asked
there
is
a
house
behind
the
church
deserted
it
was
killed
under
de
ruyter
and
his
wife
died
last
year
the
fisherman
gave
slow
information
a
youngster
from
the
hague
has
it
now
but
you
can
fasten
up
your
horse
to
the
william
gave
grave
thanks
and
led
the
horse
across
the
sloping
sand
hillocks
and
secured
him
carefully
to
one
of
the
stakes
comprising
the
broken
fencing
that
surrounded
the
closed
house
when
he
returned
the
fisherman
had
bent
over
his
work
as
if
he
had
forgotten
him
but
the
prince
did
not
enter
the
church
he
came
and
stood
with
one
hand
resting
on
the
long
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
sea
the
early
sunlight
had
already
faded
a
pale
mist
blew
off
the
water
and
hurried
across
the
land
the
great
expanse
was
bounded
by
the
curtain
of
vapour
and
the
little
village
blotted
out
of
sight
shore
and
ocean
were
grey
together
divided
only
by
the
white
breaking
line
of
the
surf
murmuring
on
the
beach
vague
and
endless
the
sand
dunes
stretched
against
the
sky
pierced
with
the
straight
clusters
of
reeds
dry
and
gaunt
the
large
white
flew
out
of
the
curling
fog
and
settled
along
the
wet
line
of
shining
sand
the
retreating
foam
left
bare
the
fisherman
turned
a
heavy
gaze
on
the
motionless
figure
of
the
stranger
you
are
new
to
the
hague
no
i
have
lived
there
all
my
what
brings
you
to
scheveningen
mynheer
the
man
spoke
sullenly
almost
as
if
he
resented
the
intrusion
william
turned
i
wished
to
see
he
pointed
to
the
quiet
ocean
the
netherlander
nodded
it
was
a
feeling
he
could
understand
also
added
william
i
was
in
an
and
came
here
to
be
rid
of
it
is
quiet
they
were
both
so
used
to
the
mist
that
they
scarcely
noticed
it
will
the
boats
go
abroad
asked
the
prince
there
is
no
the
net
gathered
in
a
great
heap
at
the
fisherman
s
feet
as
his
long
needle
flew
over
the
meshes
he
moved
and
the
dried
seaweed
crackled
under
his
sabots
i
saw
de
ruyter
s
fleet
go
past
when
i
was
on
my
herring
boat
two
days
ago
great
ships
i
thought
the
lanterns
on
the
masts
were
they
are
under
weigh
to
meet
the
india
fleet
answered
the
prince
ay
they
say
the
english
are
waiting
to
drop
on
us
because
of
the
herring
fisheries
too
do
you
believe
that
mynheer
william
seated
himself
on
the
end
of
the
boat
i
do
he
answered
briefly
an
intent
look
came
into
the
old
man
s
face
that
was
cut
and
seamed
like
a
and
the
colour
of
bronze
above
his
vivid
scarf
you
think
there
will
be
war
i
do
said
william
again
with
france
and
the
fisherman
s
eyes
that
were
still
a
bright
blue
narrowed
to
slits
of
light
de
ruyter
beat
the
english
once
i
remember
it
when
they
brought
home
the
that
is
what
they
would
make
us
pay
for
m
de
witt
is
for
william
bent
his
whip
across
his
knee
nevertheless
i
think
it
will
be
war
the
french
are
on
the
curse
de
witt
the
prince
looked
at
the
man
sharply
why
do
you
say
that
because
he
would
sell
us
all
to
the
william
smiled
scornfully
i
thought
it
was
the
prince
of
orange
of
whom
they
said
that
the
prince
it
is
the
prince
of
orange
who
will
save
william
slightly
flushed
you
think
so
he
asked
softly
ay
i
know
it
the
answer
was
given
with
simple
unconscious
confidence
and
the
prince
s
colour
deepened
i
am
not
the
only
one
who
thinks
so
either
continued
the
fisherman
taking
out
his
pipe
it
is
the
thought
of
all
the
yet
you
know
nothing
of
william
of
he
has
had
no
chance
de
witt
s
prisoner
but
now
de
witt
will
william
looked
at
the
ever
changing
never
ending
line
of
surf
he
was
now
pale
even
to
the
lips
and
was
so
long
silent
that
it
seemed
suspicious
to
the
other
perhaps
you
are
one
of
the
grand
pensionary
s
men
he
suggested
with
an
accent
of
dislike
i
am
no
friend
to
john
de
the
fisherman
chuckled
relieved
i
think
he
has
not
many
friends
left
the
assembly
support
him
answered
william
slowly
and
the
people
support
the
prince
let
him
ask
for
anything
we
will
give
it
william
turned
his
brilliant
eyes
on
the
speaker
why
are
you
so
devoted
to
his
highness
he
asked
the
fisherman
reflected
he
seemed
puzzled
i
know
not
he
is
william
of
orange
he
answered
at
last
you
would
trust
him
with
the
captain
generalship
with
everything
by
god
i
would
we
are
tired
of
de
the
prince
coughed
and
made
no
answer
knocking
the
ashes
out
of
his
pipe
the
fisherman
spoke
again
he
has
kept
the
prince
out
of
his
inheritance
for
twenty
tis
so
said
william
quietly
well
now
he
is
going
to
pay
for
you
think
so
wait
and
see
william
smiled
i
have
been
waiting
to
see
for
a
long
then
you
are
for
the
prince
too
the
fisherman
expressed
a
stolid
satisfaction
i
am
for
my
country
replied
william
evasively
and
that
is
a
bigger
it
is
not
the
grand
pensionary
or
the
prince
but
our
freedom
or
our
william
of
orange
will
save
us
repeated
the
fisherman
william
smiled
half
bitterly
i
the
other
was
roused
to
argument
that
has
been
said
to
me
before
it
was
by
heinrich
potts
your
prince
has
never
heard
a
shot
nor
been
under
canvas
he
said
and
he
has
no
strength
to
live
through
one
he
paused
william
looked
down
at
him
as
he
methodically
refilled
his
pipe
well
the
first
is
true
the
second
well
may
prove
i
answered
nothing
to
that
but
he
added
your
prince
is
in
league
with
his
uncle
why
not
and
the
king
of
france
if
we
give
him
the
power
he
ll
sell
us
all
to
i
have
heard
that
before
said
william
slowly
looking
out
to
sea
well
mynheer
i
never
believed
it
but
potts
said
why
not
and
i
emptied
his
tankard
in
his
he
said
de
witt
was
a
good
i
think
he
is
commented
william
dryly
but
you
are
for
the
prince
urged
the
fisherman
he
will
save
us
from
de
witt
and
from
the
french
he
added
there
was
a
pause
then
the
old
netherlander
began
anew
they
say
the
prince
of
tarentum
pays
court
to
him
and
wants
him
to
marry
his
daughter
do
you
think
that
is
true
m
de
tarentum
flies
too
high
i
do
not
think
the
prince
will
marry
a
i
am
glad
of
he
looked
up
shrewdly
into
the
young
man
s
face
you
are
from
the
hague
you
will
know
something
of
affairs
he
paused
do
you
know
anything
of
the
prince
he
asked
at
length
william
turned
his
head
away
a
the
fisherman
spread
his
huge
brown
hands
on
his
knees
what
do
you
think
he
will
do
mynheer
in
the
matter
of
the
war
you
believe
in
him
you
say
ay
i
do
to
hell
with
de
witt
then
believing
in
him
ye
know
well
what
he
will
defy
the
french
william
kept
his
gaze
upon
the
sea
that
would
be
madness
they
defy
them
that
is
what
the
prince
will
do
i
swear
to
ye
mynheer
with
that
he
tilted
his
head
a
little
and
watched
the
long
wreaths
of
blue
smoke
disappear
into
the
misty
air
william
was
silent
slightly
frowning
his
expression
was
thoughtful
as
if
he
considered
weighty
matters
the
mist
seemed
to
gather
and
deepen
it
broke
against
the
old
church
and
hurried
away
across
the
sand
dunes
blotting
them
out
a
little
sound
like
a
satisfied
sigh
repeated
once
or
twice
came
from
somewhere
near
the
prince
he
looked
round
and
saw
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
against
which
he
leaned
a
large
and
gaily
dressed
child
sitting
up
and
rubbing
its
eyes
conscious
in
a
moment
of
the
gaze
turned
on
it
with
surprising
rapidity
it
scrambled
out
of
the
boat
and
shook
out
voluminous
skirts
it
wore
a
tight
bodice
worked
with
yellow
and
red
roses
striped
sleeves
of
blue
and
white
and
enormous
skirts
of
a
bright
green
colour
that
stuck
out
as
if
the
little
person
had
been
thrust
through
a
half
apple
a
close
lace
cap
was
drawn
over
its
head
and
from
under
it
hung
long
pale
yellow
curls
framing
a
smooth
expressionless
face
of
rosy
brown
with
large
eyes
the
fisherman
gave
it
a
stolid
nod
william
turned
on
it
the
remote
but
curious
gaze
of
youth
surveying
infancy
is
it
a
boy
he
asked
my
grandson
the
fisherman
pointed
out
in
the
back
of
the
baby
s
cap
the
coloured
button
that
showed
its
sex
he
has
been
asleep
in
the
boat
he
sleeps
all
the
baby
collapsed
rather
than
sat
down
on
the
wreaths
of
dry
seaweed
and
stared
stolidly
at
the
prince
a
couple
of
screaming
started
up
from
the
land
and
flew
out
across
the
grey
depths
of
shrouded
sea
the
wind
is
getting
up
remarked
the
fisherman
the
boats
will
be
able
to
put
out
william
took
no
notice
he
seemed
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
tell
me
what
you
think
the
prince
will
do
urged
the
fisherman
who
was
beginning
to
feel
some
awe
of
the
stranger
what
kind
of
a
man
is
he
he
added
jerking
the
nets
across
his
knee
the
baby
staggered
to
its
feet
shaking
a
coral
and
silver
ornament
depending
from
its
waist
it
fell
at
once
on
its
face
with
an
unchanged
expression
rose
again
and
clutched
at
the
prince
s
hand
to
steady
itself
he
wants
to
get
into
the
boat
again
said
william
respectfully
the
baby
blinked
up
at
him
and
kept
a
tight
grasp
on
his
glove
the
prince
deferred
to
the
grandfather
as
to
what
line
of
action
was
to
be
taken
with
this
novelty
shall
i
put
him
into
the
boat
again
he
asked
nay
mynheer
let
him
be
he
sleeps
too
much
that
is
why
he
is
so
i
like
him
said
william
gravely
i
have
never
seen
a
child
so
close
the
fisherman
was
not
enthusiastic
he
returned
to
his
point
what
can
you
tell
me
of
the
prince
mynheer
william
gave
him
an
intent
look
what
can
tell
you
of
the
prince
of
orange
his
gaze
fastened
itself
once
more
on
the
line
of
surf
ever
falling
ever
renewed
his
manner
dropped
into
an
absorption
he
had
an
unhappy
childhood
he
said
i
think
he
was
a
prisoner
and
he
had
high
desires
also
he
was
weakly
made
his
days
a
burden
to
him
he
knew
always
that
he
could
not
live
at
the
utmost
to
more
than
middle
well
his
life
had
been
maimed
for
him
before
he
was
born
and
with
the
loneliness
and
the
humiliation
and
the
long
hours
of
pain
he
was
sometimes
near
despair
but
god
supported
him
i
believed
always
what
was
i
saying
he
believed
in
predestination
so
i
think
that
god
had
set
him
apart
made
him
so
different
from
other
men
because
he
had
an
especial
mission
for
him
the
protection
of
the
church
of
the
reformed
religion
he
believed
in
that
always
and
he
hated
the
french
and
the
romish
faith
and
he
loved
his
the
speaker
s
voice
fell
very
low
i
can
say
this
for
him
that
while
he
draws
his
breath
such
as
these
he
looked
down
at
the
little
child
shall
not
inherit
slavery
the
netherlands
shall
own
no
second
the
fisherman
sat
silent
that
is
all
i
know
of
the
prince
of
orange
added
william
as
yet
he
hath
had
no
chance
no
chance
to
prove
ye
know
him
very
well
said
the
old
man
after
a
weighty
pause
and
i
am
sure
that
he
is
even
as
you
say
a
second
alva
king
louis
would
be
a
second
philip
but
we
have
still
a
william
of
the
baby
had
dropped
to
the
sand
again
and
the
prince
rose
turned
and
without
further
word
entered
the
humble
church
for
a
moment
he
stood
at
the
door
looking
at
the
whitewashed
interior
the
stiff
wooden
pews
the
tablets
to
the
memory
of
sailors
and
the
little
brass
models
of
ships
that
hung
from
the
rafters
from
those
who
had
escaped
dire
perils
at
sea
in
his
ears
was
the
perpetual
roar
of
the
waves
and
in
his
nostrils
the
salt
breeze
of
the
ocean
after
a
while
he
returned
to
the
boats
and
walked
up
and
down
thoughtfully
the
youngsters
will
be
coming
to
the
farm
remarked
the
fisherman
they
have
a
printing
press
ah
who
are
they
asked
the
prince
sharply
young
men
from
the
hague
orangists
they
print
pamphlets
against
de
witt
i
know
it
they
composed
that
last
to
every
faithful
they
talk
big
too
jounker
van
der
graef
is
one
and
his
father
a
magistrate
the
child
was
crawling
round
the
edge
of
the
boat
it
lifted
a
grave
face
to
the
prince
who
stooped
and
picked
it
up
years
or
so
afterwards
when
a
great
king
who
had
broken
the
power
of
france
freed
england
and
formed
one
of
the
hugest
coalitions
the
world
has
known
famous
as
a
statesman
glorious
as
a
soldier
died
in
a
palace
very
far
from
scheveningen
his
done
a
young
fisherman
amid
the
grief
of
holland
recalled
with
awe
that
william
of
orange
had
once
held
him
in
his
william
placed
him
gently
in
the
boat
then
turned
rather
sharply
what
is
that
he
asked
through
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
surf
might
be
distinctly
heard
the
sound
of
approaching
people
talking
and
even
laughing
as
if
they
had
lost
their
way
in
the
mist
the
jounker
van
der
graef
and
his
companions
said
the
fisherman
they
are
coming
here
as
i
said
the
prince
hastened
to
loosen
his
horse
and
to
remount
but
as
he
leapt
to
the
saddle
several
figures
emerged
out
of
the
fog
william
turned
the
grey
horse
away
from
scheveningen
towards
the
undulating
obscure
lines
of
the
sand
dunes
but
they
had
seen
him
a
stranger
cried
the
foremost
the
prince
gave
a
glance
at
him
over
his
shoulder
ah
jacob
van
der
graef
caught
his
breath
and
fell
back
a
pace
the
prince
put
spurs
to
his
horse
and
galloped
away
along
the
dunes
in
a
moment
he
was
a
mere
shadowy
shape
against
the
sea
fog
jacob
van
der
graef
ran
down
the
beach
to
where
the
old
fisherman
sat
the
prince
of
orange
he
cried
excitedly
what
was
he
doing
here
william
riding
through
the
grey
loneliness
was
thinking
of
these
conspirators
they
are
fools
he
said
but
there
are
times
when
fools
may
be
chapter
iv
the
defeat
of
de
witt
matthew
bromley
was
summoned
to
the
great
formal
audience
chamber
of
the
palace
it
was
twilight
and
the
prince
not
yet
returned
in
the
palace
and
in
the
hague
a
great
excitement
loomed
and
gathered
the
assembly
had
sat
all
day
fearful
rumours
were
current
as
to
the
safety
of
the
india
fleet
and
the
reason
of
de
ruyter
s
silence
bromley
carried
a
copy
of
as
he
entered
the
room
where
the
two
gentlemen
waited
for
his
highness
by
the
feeble
candlelight
that
but
faintly
dispelled
the
lowering
shadows
he
saw
them
one
florent
van
mander
the
other
a
fair
and
handsome
gentleman
young
and
very
elegantly
attired
in
a
grey
velvet
and
silver
riding
suit
ah
bromley
have
you
quite
forgotten
me
the
newcomer
rose
and
held
out
his
hand
the
englishman
was
genuinely
pleased
m
bentinck
at
last
returned
from
exile
as
you
see
where
is
his
highness
abroad
they
tell
abroad
certainly
where
i
do
not
bentinck
raised
his
brows
does
no
one
know
bromley
nodded
at
van
mander
sir
fagel
came
to
see
his
highness
this
morning
and
afterwards
the
prince
left
the
house
in
a
alone
bentinck
looked
considerably
surprised
he
is
no
longer
under
any
supervision
none
at
all
now
sir
de
witt
has
had
to
cede
his
authority
little
by
little
till
he
has
none
left
in
all
the
united
provinces
i
think
smiled
bentinck
oh
mynheer
i
am
tired
i
have
lain
sick
a
week
at
he
seated
himself
in
one
of
the
heavy
leather
chairs
and
his
gay
face
and
rich
clothes
made
a
brightness
in
the
large
and
sombre
chamber
shall
i
not
order
dinner
for
you
asked
bromley
no
i
thank
you
we
dined
on
the
florent
retained
his
seat
by
the
window
composed
and
grave
pulling
at
his
hat
and
feather
that
he
held
across
his
knee
his
taciturnity
seemed
to
absolve
the
others
from
the
unusual
in
leaving
him
out
of
their
conversation
how
goes
his
highness
affair
in
the
assembly
asked
bentinck
it
was
concerning
that
fagel
came
this
morning
m
fagel
has
turned
courtier
as
have
some
others
yes
bentinck
leant
back
in
his
chair
his
attractive
face
was
thoughtful
he
fingered
the
ribbon
on
his
velvet
cuff
we
received
garbled
reports
in
brandenburg
what
do
you
think
bromley
of
the
chances
of
war
the
englishman
shrugged
his
shoulders
de
pomponne
hath
been
withdrawn
and
no
other
sent
in
spite
of
de
witt
s
representations
no
concession
will
pacify
king
louis
he
can
not
forgive
the
triple
no
and
some
other
things
the
medal
and
van
beuningen
s
bentinck
lifted
his
blue
eyes
and
the
english
matthew
bromley
laughed
well
they
say
the
english
are
as
insolent
as
the
french
temple
was
recalled
and
sir
george
downing
sent
to
provoke
a
war
i
truly
think
you
heard
of
the
treaty
of
dover
well
king
charles
protests
love
to
his
highness
always
but
hates
the
i
am
not
a
soldier
nor
a
diplomat
if
war
is
declared
i
shall
go
leave
the
prince
s
service
i
am
english
said
matthew
bromley
lightly
he
went
to
the
mantelshelf
and
snuffed
the
candles
bentinck
frowned
the
english
people
the
english
parliament
are
not
friendly
to
the
bromley
agreed
heartily
it
is
solely
charles
then
he
laughed
again
did
you
hear
of
the
sir
william
s
yacht
was
it
not
yes
taking
lady
temple
home
the
yacht
passed
through
your
fleet
and
demanded
the
salute
fired
on
your
flag
captain
told
to
of
course
is
in
the
tower
now
for
not
doing
more
what
does
that
look
like
but
war
the
pretexts
are
utterly
wanton
and
frivolous
remarked
bentinck
m
de
witt
hath
ceded
the
salute
of
the
the
young
dutch
noble
flushed
swiftly
doth
he
still
hope
to
obtain
peace
bromley
shrugged
his
shoulders
downing
made
some
impossible
demands
he
is
a
ruffler
sent
to
cause
friction
of
course
i
should
say
his
secret
orders
were
to
provoke
a
war
by
any
he
paused
then
added
with
meaning
but
both
the
kings
protest
friendship
to
his
highness
his
uncle
saith
one
of
his
grievances
against
the
republic
is
that
the
prince
hath
been
kept
so
long
out
of
his
bentinck
rose
you
think
his
highness
and
his
friends
are
safe
enough
he
said
quietly
yes
but
i
would
not
give
much
for
the
safety
of
de
as
he
spoke
the
door
was
flung
wide
and
the
prince
entered
with
an
unusual
impetuosity
van
mander
unnoticed
by
all
rose
to
his
feet
in
the
shadows
of
the
window
bentinck
exclaimed
william
he
dashed
his
hat
down
on
a
chair
inside
the
door
bentinck
your
highness
the
young
man
sank
to
one
knee
and
kissed
the
prince
s
hands
william
raised
him
you
are
well
you
have
recovered
he
asked
eagerly
completely
to
see
the
hague
and
you
again
highness
would
have
cured
me
had
i
been
far
william
gazed
intently
into
the
fair
ardent
face
you
must
come
upstairs
with
me
how
dark
and
cold
it
is
here
he
looked
round
and
saw
matthew
bromley
standing
by
the
mantelshelf
at
once
he
crossed
over
to
him
bromley
i
spoke
violently
to
you
this
morning
he
said
and
i
am
sorry
will
you
forgive
me
it
was
william
s
habit
to
make
instant
reparation
for
his
rare
outbursts
of
passion
but
bromley
had
not
expected
he
would
ask
pardon
of
his
own
gentleman
m
fagel
vexed
me
continued
the
prince
i
had
no
fault
to
find
with
bromley
coloured
and
stood
in
a
foolish
confusion
william
offered
his
hand
with
the
graceful
courtesy
he
knew
so
well
how
to
use
bromley
flushed
more
deeply
with
gratification
and
pleasure
it
was
nothing
your
highness
he
protested
and
the
prince
had
secured
a
lifelong
devotion
it
did
not
occur
to
bromley
to
call
his
master
s
graciousness
policy
the
obvious
sincerity
of
william
s
rare
advances
was
what
gave
them
their
value
he
was
above
any
arts
making
no
efforts
to
gain
supporters
there
were
already
men
who
would
have
died
for
his
praise
and
performed
heroic
feats
to
avoid
his
blame
he
smiled
at
bromley
and
caught
bentinck
by
the
arm
highness
i
return
in
the
midst
of
great
william
turned
the
smile
on
him
and
drew
him
from
the
room
bentinck
adored
the
prince
not
more
so
than
many
not
more
so
perhaps
than
florent
van
mander
standing
unnoticed
unthought
of
but
william
had
chosen
to
bestow
on
him
his
friendship
william
bentinck
was
intelligent
he
had
always
been
blindly
loyal
to
the
house
of
nassau
he
was
of
a
rare
good
looks
and
attractiveness
and
had
been
the
prince
s
page
when
they
were
children
william
admitted
him
to
his
closest
confidence
and
was
more
open
with
him
than
with
any
none
knowing
better
however
than
william
bentinck
that
in
any
serious
matter
he
had
not
the
slightest
influence
with
his
master
the
prince
would
do
anything
to
please
him
in
trivial
affairs
but
he
was
his
own
counsellor
those
associated
with
him
were
no
more
than
the
lieutenants
of
his
will
without
words
this
was
understood
between
them
bentinck
offered
neither
advice
nor
criticism
his
first
words
when
they
were
alone
were
characteristic
what
are
you
going
to
do
highness
in
what
way
can
i
help
you
he
asked
eagerly
william
looked
at
him
as
if
the
sight
of
his
glowing
handsomeness
was
a
pleasure
the
smile
was
still
on
his
lips
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
not
be
drawn
into
serious
questions
his
attitude
was
rather
like
that
of
a
man
to
a
woman
whom
he
loves
but
must
always
with
a
half
laugh
condescend
to
when
it
concerns
the
discussion
of
large
issues
tell
me
of
your
journey
and
sickness
he
said
you
have
changed
very
little
he
added
with
a
deepening
of
his
smile
and
you
have
changed
a
great
deal
replied
bentinck
gazing
at
him
eagerly
do
you
think
so
they
had
reached
the
quiet
library
the
prince
sat
beside
his
friend
on
an
oak
settle
that
stood
against
the
wall
the
room
was
golden
from
end
to
end
with
the
light
of
candles
and
a
silver
lamp
placed
on
the
desk
where
it
cast
a
strong
glow
over
a
bowl
of
orange
and
purple
tulips
the
curtains
were
not
drawn
and
each
of
the
long
windows
framed
a
picture
of
blue
twilight
trees
and
sky
what
of
de
witt
asked
bentinck
it
seems
to
me
he
can
not
long
keep
the
power
every
village
i
rode
through
seethed
with
tell
me
of
yourself
my
lord
urged
william
affectionately
i
have
been
without
friends
so
of
myself
you
jest
highness
i
an
exile
newly
returned
to
the
theatre
of
great
events
william
sighed
there
is
very
little
to
tell
you
there
will
be
war
of
and
the
captain
generalship
m
fagel
was
here
this
morning
to
offer
it
to
me
for
one
and
you
william
smiled
anew
into
the
young
man
s
comely
ardent
face
now
with
a
half
mournful
air
i
unconditionally
my
faith
cried
bentinck
that
was
a
bold
move
i
think
it
will
prove
a
successful
william
spoke
as
if
he
explained
himself
from
a
pure
effort
of
friendship
and
would
have
preferred
to
talk
of
other
things
m
de
witt
was
at
the
back
of
of
who
are
his
men
prince
john
maurice
prince
charles
wurtz
and
de
none
of
them
his
friends
save
the
no
i
have
their
promise
not
to
accept
the
post
if
it
be
offered
them
the
promise
of
the
first
three
i
and
prince
charles
daughter
william
looked
at
him
keenly
who
told
you
that
the
elector
spoke
to
me
of
it
said
prince
charles
would
be
pleased
to
make
an
alliance
on
those
they
are
too
high
answered
the
prince
think
no
more
of
it
i
have
and
the
french
match
william
unexpectedly
coloured
king
louis
wished
a
french
princess
to
seal
his
friendship
did
he
not
continued
bentinck
the
prince
rose
coughing
a
little
and
crossed
to
the
hearth
the
french
ambassador
at
berlin
told
me
so
much
william
answered
sternly
no
doubt
my
cousin
louis
thought
it
a
great
i
told
de
pomponne
that
my
house
was
used
to
contract
alliances
with
royalty
i
do
not
wish
to
quarter
the
bend
sinister
with
my
king
louis
will
never
forgive
he
protests
he
is
my
very
good
friend
he
thinks
he
may
have
use
for
this
war
if
it
please
you
is
largely
on
my
behalf
to
punish
the
ingratitude
of
the
william
walked
up
and
down
the
hearth
he
still
wore
his
roquelaure
and
clasped
his
hands
behind
him
under
the
full
skirts
whatever
he
may
say
he
will
never
forgive
that
repeated
bentinck
it
is
i
who
will
never
forgive
said
william
that
he
should
so
have
mistaken
how
i
rate
well
and
there
will
be
war
flashed
the
other
leaning
forward
this
spring
i
the
pretexts
are
utterly
wanton
you
heard
of
the
incident
some
account
and
my
uncle
charles
has
sent
one
downing
over
an
insupportable
swashbuckler
temple
was
a
good
fellow
and
friendly
therefore
he
was
it
will
be
england
too
you
think
yes
but
i
have
hopes
of
my
uncle
then
william
turned
to
face
his
companion
did
you
hear
of
their
complaints
he
asked
in
an
amused
tone
my
uncle
protests
that
the
decked
with
english
flags
was
shown
for
a
penny
a
head
to
gaping
boors
thereupon
de
witt
sends
the
flags
back
and
withdraws
the
ship
a
move
cried
bentinck
as
if
my
uncle
was
a
man
to
care
for
his
country
s
prestige
then
it
was
his
christian
majesty
he
complains
that
van
beuningen
after
his
return
from
the
treaty
of
was
presented
with
a
medal
making
mock
of
his
william
never
devoid
of
humour
laughed
outright
showing
his
white
teeth
in
genuine
amusement
the
noble
city
of
amsterdam
was
accused
of
this
nec
pluribus
impar
is
his
majesty
s
motto
and
they
had
a
presentment
of
king
sun
with
his
rays
clipped
and
this
inscription
in
conspectu
meo
stelit
there
were
other
offences
too
pamphlets
printed
at
the
hague
insulting
the
omnipotent
poor
de
witt
and
van
beuningen
have
been
rushing
to
and
fro
trying
to
appease
the
offended
he
added
in
a
graver
tone
but
of
course
louvois
is
behind
it
he
is
jealous
of
our
m
de
witt
i
take
it
still
hopes
for
peace
even
de
witt
answered
william
will
not
be
able
to
indulge
that
hope
much
longer
i
he
rested
his
elbow
against
the
mantelshelf
and
took
his
face
in
his
hand
the
candlelight
fell
softly
on
his
thick
bright
hair
and
sparkled
in
the
green
ring
on
his
little
finger
bentinck
sat
silent
gazing
at
his
master
he
could
not
quite
understand
the
prince
s
attitude
he
had
never
considered
william
as
one
with
the
united
provinces
but
rather
as
their
enemy
what
therefore
would
be
his
attitude
in
the
forthcoming
war
it
was
against
the
republic
the
furies
of
france
were
directed
not
against
william
of
orange
in
the
invasion
of
his
country
he
might
find
his
own
advantage
he
was
in
no
way
bound
to
the
service
of
a
state
that
had
never
placed
any
confidence
in
him
but
had
treated
him
as
a
prisoner
all
his
life
his
obvious
policy
lay
in
a
compact
with
france
but
so
far
he
appeared
to
have
rejected
such
overtures
as
had
been
made
to
him
i
can
not
see
clearly
how
you
stand
highness
said
bentinck
at
last
puzzled
no
in
no
man
s
company
did
the
prince
smile
so
much
my
attitude
is
rather
difficult
to
define
is
it
not
my
child
william
was
three
or
four
years
younger
than
bentinck
and
half
a
head
shorter
but
the
expression
did
not
sound
foolish
on
his
lips
how
will
war
help
you
asked
bentinck
thoughtfully
the
prince
did
not
seem
inclined
to
answer
this
i
have
had
a
whole
day
of
idleness
he
said
for
the
first
time
since
i
can
not
remember
when
i
went
to
scheveningen
idle
but
not
useless
i
encountered
an
old
man
there
and
a
child
his
confidence
william
turned
towards
the
settee
they
all
look
to
me
to
save
them
does
not
that
seem
curious
after
all
de
witt
has
done
bentinck
caressed
the
fine
lace
at
his
wrist
it
is
certainly
strange
de
witt
should
be
so
disliked
he
answered
it
is
his
peace
policy
confess
is
it
not
stranger
that
i
should
be
beloved
bentinck
smiled
can
not
think
so
they
know
nothing
of
me
they
give
me
the
credit
of
my
the
prince
turned
to
the
window
now
and
looked
out
on
to
the
darkening
prospect
of
trees
and
sky
m
de
witt
hath
opposed
me
most
bitterly
in
the
assembly
he
said
i
think
he
called
me
some
hard
names
an
inexperienced
boy
ah
what
i
have
taken
from
that
man
william
jacob
de
witt
does
not
forget
loevenstein
nor
do
i
he
coughed
and
abruptly
changed
the
subject
do
you
remember
what
they
did
to
the
children
when
alva
had
rule
here
william
i
saw
a
child
on
the
sands
do
you
think
the
french
would
be
more
merciful
than
the
spanish
their
romish
faith
king
louis
hopes
to
celebrate
mass
at
the
if
the
peace
negotiations
fail
what
could
one
do
asked
bentinck
we
have
de
ruyter
but
there
is
no
captain
to
hold
the
french
back
on
the
one
might
arise
answered
the
prince
you
think
william
cut
him
short
we
talk
too
weightily
i
have
had
no
dinner
you
must
dine
again
to
keep
me
company
how
are
my
uncle
the
elector
and
my
cousin
charlotte
bentinck
rose
it
could
be
a
match
there
if
you
wished
highness
you
see
there
are
many
courting
your
i
am
already
adept
in
the
art
of
saying
no
answered
the
prince
it
would
please
the
elector
and
the
princess
dowager
i
do
not
think
the
lady
herself
would
be
averse
william
frowned
it
is
not
even
to
be
considered
my
fortunes
are
too
unsettled
for
me
to
think
of
a
wife
ah
here
is
he
turned
quickly
at
his
gentleman
s
entrance
a
message
from
the
assembly
bromley
yes
the
prince
took
the
letter
that
was
offered
him
and
flashed
a
look
at
bentinck
m
fagel
come
to
his
senses
i
believe
he
said
and
tore
the
seal
bromley
explained
the
assembly
has
just
risen
highness
the
messenger
came
here
at
once
he
said
from
a
swift
colour
had
come
into
the
prince
s
thin
cheeks
yes
it
is
from
he
glanced
over
the
letter
then
handed
it
to
bentinck
read
it
william
it
is
as
i
thought
it
must
bentinck
cast
his
eyes
over
the
writing
the
ink
of
it
barely
dry
the
sweeps
of
the
quill
blotted
in
the
writer
s
haste
the
binnenhof
your
highness
we
have
news
from
de
ruyter
that
the
india
fleet
was
attacked
by
the
english
but
by
god
his
grace
saved
war
is
inevitable
their
noble
mightinesses
have
appointed
you
captain
general
of
the
land
and
sea
forces
for
life
accept
my
humble
congratulations
on
this
success
i
write
in
haste
your
servant
frederick
of
then
it
is
done
cried
bentinck
highness
i
am
beyond
measure
pleased
this
is
the
more
a
triumph
that
it
hath
not
been
undisputed
it
is
the
attempt
on
the
india
fleet
hath
decided
them
returned
the
prince
only
this
morning
they
offered
a
compromise
then
he
looked
straightly
and
keenly
at
bromley
your
king
has
attacked
de
ruyter
he
said
england
will
declare
war
on
the
united
provinces
perhaps
you
would
wish
to
leave
my
service
matthew
bromley
laughed
and
coloured
in
a
half
confusion
tis
a
long
while
since
i
was
home
but
you
are
i
am
not
a
romanist
still
an
anglican
said
the
prince
as
if
he
considered
the
one
creed
almost
as
offensive
as
the
other
but
his
eyes
were
kindly
bromley
bowed
i
serve
your
highness
not
the
united
provinces
he
said
with
the
air
of
one
who
has
cut
a
gordian
knot
william
folded
up
his
uncle
s
letter
the
united
provinces
have
made
me
captain
general
bromley
i
am
in
their
service
i
will
stay
if
your
highness
will
have
me
was
the
englishman
s
answer
he
smiled
a
little
humorously
england
is
probably
in
the
wrong
he
said
his
thought
was
that
william
was
right
right
for
ever
in
bromley
s
eyes
after
those
words
to
him
that
evening
the
prince
smiled
i
am
glad
to
keep
may
i
give
your
highness
my
congratulations
and
good
wishes
thank
you
the
englishman
withdrew
this
is
something
to
have
wrung
from
de
witt
cried
bentinck
excitedly
tis
a
violation
of
the
terms
of
the
act
of
he
would
have
been
wiser
to
have
given
it
said
william
slowly
i
begged
him
to
i
was
certain
of
it
from
the
with
a
little
cough
he
moved
to
the
mantelshelf
again
he
seemed
in
no
way
elated
or
moved
weary
rather
he
fell
again
into
the
reserved
silence
bentinck
s
had
dispelled
and
looked
in
an
absorbed
and
thoughtful
manner
on
the
ground
his
friend
could
not
quite
understand
a
thousand
ardours
clutched
at
his
heart
that
he
could
not
express
he
saw
in
the
captain
generalship
a
step
to
the
stadtholdership
but
what
of
the
war
war
is
inevitable
de
zuylestein
says
it
has
been
so
ever
since
de
pomponne
was
recalled
de
courtin
s
nomination
was
a
mere
farce
de
witt
would
never
see
it
answered
the
prince
you
speak
of
france
meaning
england
also
what
hath
she
become
but
king
louis
tool
he
put
his
hand
to
his
brow
come
to
dinner
william
and
speak
of
other
chapter
v
the
declaration
of
war
i
write
this
for
your
private
satisfaction
and
that
you
may
be
fully
informed
of
how
affairs
stand
with
me
and
that
way
be
better
able
to
help
us
as
i
am
sure
you
have
the
will
since
war
was
declared
in
london
my
burdens
have
become
almost
intolerable
i
usually
work
from
eight
in
the
morning
till
nine
at
night
often
without
touching
food
and
still
can
not
get
through
all
there
is
to
do
their
high
mightinesses
have
allowed
my
clerk
van
den
bosch
to
take
my
place
in
the
assembly
and
make
notes
of
the
speeches
and
have
also
permitted
me
to
share
some
of
my
duties
with
vivien
otherwise
i
could
not
do
it
the
labour
is
incredible
and
on
all
sides
i
am
rewarded
with
complaints
the
forced
loans
raise
a
storm
of
dissent
yet
there
is
bitter
railing
that
the
army
is
reduced
and
the
forts
dismantled
i
am
accused
of
every
corruption
conceivable
from
a
secret
understanding
with
de
louvois
to
the
taking
of
the
secret
service
money
for
my
own
uses
i
tell
you
this
to
show
something
of
the
state
the
country
is
in
the
voices
of
prudence
justice
and
common
sense
can
scarce
be
heard
among
the
clamour
of
the
factions
my
desire
for
peace
is
regarded
with
suspicion
and
my
opposition
to
the
violation
of
the
act
of
harmony
as
a
crime
the
prince
of
orange
had
to
take
the
oaths
never
to
attempt
or
even
accept
the
stadtholdership
on
his
appointment
to
the
captain
generalship
but
what
are
oaths
in
these
times
few
have
lately
shown
themselves
jealous
of
their
word
the
magistrates
frightened
by
the
people
lean
to
the
side
of
the
prince
and
i
fear
we
have
knocked
away
the
keystone
of
our
liberty
this
young
man
wishes
to
be
absolute
he
shows
his
imperious
temper
more
clearly
every
day
he
has
already
given
marks
of
his
dislike
to
colonel
bampfield
and
other
officers
in
my
confidence
m
fagel
is
utterly
on
his
side
and
heinsius
only
de
groot
at
present
dismissed
by
his
french
majesty
from
paris
beuningen
and
vivien
remain
staunch
my
brother
cornelius
departed
for
the
fleet
the
of
this
month
he
is
so
crippled
with
rheumatism
that
he
hath
to
direct
his
ship
from
an
on
the
deck
the
lord
god
guard
him
you
see
i
give
you
family
news
knowing
that
your
love
for
me
will
tolerate
it
at
present
i
have
in
my
house
my
sister
her
husband
my
father
and
my
children
who
are
just
returned
from
a
visit
to
their
uncle
bicker
van
swieten
they
desire
their
kind
remembrances
to
you
the
last
news
is
that
the
king
of
france
has
joined
his
troops
at
charleroi
and
so
opened
the
campaign
the
prince
of
orange
starts
for
his
camp
his
headquarters
are
to
be
at
bodegraven
my
heart
misgives
me
that
such
an
untried
boy
should
be
put
in
complete
command
of
our
sole
defences
but
it
is
astonishing
what
enthusiasm
there
is
for
him
in
the
army
general
wurtz
and
prince
john
maurice
both
declare
he
is
worth
men
and
de
ruyter
says
his
sailors
work
better
now
his
highness
is
at
the
head
of
things
his
popularity
is
at
fever
height
he
further
pleases
the
people
by
declaring
for
war
and
wishing
to
break
off
the
negotiations
i
have
with
so
much
labour
been
keeping
open
it
seems
as
if
i
could
do
nothing
right
and
he
nothing
wrong
god
help
us
in
our
extremity
i
can
not
tell
you
how
i
miss
the
pleasure
of
your
company
i
know
that
this
lamentable
war
is
the
defeat
of
your
policy
as
it
is
of
mine
and
that
you
wish
us
nothing
but
good
it
is
another
motive
for
me
to
desire
to
be
free
of
these
unhappy
times
that
we
might
meet
and
converse
again
keep
me
in
your
heart
always
i
pray
you
and
write
to
me
privately
when
you
have
the
leisure
mm
condé
turenne
vauban
and
luxemberg
are
with
his
majesty
at
charleroi
and
one
of
the
finest
armies
i
hear
that
ever
left
france
i
still
keep
up
a
correspondence
with
de
louvois
but
i
have
little
hope
of
obtaining
reason
and
justice
from
a
rapacious
minister
and
a
vainglorious
king
but
he
who
hath
put
these
afflictions
on
me
will
teach
me
how
to
bear
them
and
i
must
not
repine
against
what
he
chooses
to
lay
on
me
give
my
loving
duty
to
your
lady
and
take
as
much
yourself
from
one
who
will
always
be
your
friend
john
de
witt
given
at
my
house
in
the
kneuterdyk
avenue
may
the
the
grand
pensionary
shook
the
sand
over
his
letter
folded
and
sealed
it
then
wrote
on
the
cover
in
his
refined
clear
hand
to
the
honourable
sir
william
temple
baronet
at
his
residence
at
sheen
in
the
county
of
surrey
it
was
late
afternoon
when
the
grand
pensionary
rose
and
raised
his
eyes
he
saw
a
glimmer
of
gold
and
green
through
the
window
beside
his
desk
the
quiver
of
the
trees
the
glow
of
the
sunshine
in
the
garden
which
was
filled
with
narcissi
daffodils
and
tulips
arranged
in
circles
and
straight
bars
of
colour
among
the
close
grass
and
neat
under
the
limes
sat
anna
de
witt
with
her
which
made
a
swift
gentle
sound
as
her
foot
touched
the
treadle
the
sunshine
rested
on
her
smooth
yellow
hair
and
white
cap
and
on
her
rich
but
simple
grey
satin
gown
on
a
low
stool
beside
her
sat
agneta
also
in
grey
for
the
daughters
of
john
de
witt
were
still
in
mourning
for
their
mother
about
their
feet
the
pigeons
gathered
and
strutted
pearl
coloured
and
white
and
grey
the
hue
of
anna
s
flax
john
de
witt
stood
for
a
moment
at
the
window
looking
at
the
quiet
little
figures
under
the
trees
then
he
turned
away
quickly
and
was
about
to
touch
a
bell
on
his
table
when
jacob
de
witt
entered
the
library
ah
i
did
not
know
that
you
were
at
home
sir
said
the
grand
pensionary
i
can
do
very
little
till
the
states
sit
again
answered
the
old
man
very
he
seated
himself
by
the
hearth
and
clasped
his
hand
round
the
black
stick
he
carried
this
last
month
or
so
had
given
him
his
full
age
his
head
trembled
a
little
and
his
shoulders
were
bowed
you
are
so
seldom
here
now
john
he
said
wistfully
sir
i
am
here
now
but
for
a
while
i
must
leave
where
are
you
going
john
de
witt
crossed
to
his
father
s
chair
the
prince
leaves
for
the
army
sir
and
i
think
it
desirable
that
i
should
see
him
jacob
de
witt
sighed
to
the
end
his
son
added
that
no
private
bitterness
may
endanger
our
safety
his
highness
must
know
that
i
shall
second
him
with
my
whole
he
knows
that
i
have
not
seen
him
john
de
witt
answered
slowly
since
he
was
invested
with
the
captain
generalship
he
is
surrounded
by
those
who
are
no
friends
to
me
there
must
be
some
understanding
between
us
he
repeated
anxiously
some
the
old
man
straightened
himself
in
his
chair
his
dim
eyes
seemed
to
gather
fire
what
understanding
can
there
be
between
you
and
this
young
man
john
son
of
a
bad
house
of
the
cursed
stewarts
and
the
arrogant
nassau
he
is
a
born
tyrant
like
his
father
woe
to
us
if
he
triumph
hush
my
father
the
grand
pensionary
interrupted
we
can
not
judge
him
by
another
s
we
can
judge
him
by
the
blood
that
is
in
he
hath
been
elected
to
lead
our
armies
as
his
of
the
state
i
must
support
him
said
john
de
witt
firmly
personal
feelings
must
not
touch
politics
jacob
de
witt
s
thin
hands
tightened
round
his
stick
do
you
think
that
is
the
way
he
looks
at
it
john
if
he
snatches
the
power
will
he
be
magnanimous
to
you
to
any
of
us
he
comes
of
a
race
that
can
hate
of
a
race
that
can
not
the
grand
pensionary
looked
at
his
father
with
wide
and
tired
eyes
i
pray
you
speak
words
of
good
omen
sir
he
said
softly
the
old
man
went
on
as
if
he
did
not
hear
you
have
never
felt
the
weight
of
a
prince
s
anger
you
have
never
been
cast
into
prison
by
the
wrath
of
a
what
have
we
done
his
voice
rose
almost
to
a
wail
what
have
we
done
nursed
a
viper
to
destroy
sir
cried
john
de
witt
i
have
given
the
prince
no
cause
to
hate
no
cause
the
old
statesman
s
stern
eyes
rested
on
his
son
you
have
kept
him
for
twenty
years
out
of
what
he
considers
his
do
you
think
that
william
of
orange
does
not
hold
that
cause
enough
to
hate
you
the
grand
pensionary
put
his
hand
to
his
heart
in
a
half
agitated
manner
that
the
prince
misliked
my
office
i
have
been
brought
to
see
that
he
hates
me
i
can
not
believe
he
paused
then
added
he
owes
me
some
he
will
hate
you
the
more
for
that
replied
jacob
de
witt
gratitude
prince
maurice
was
grateful
to
john
van
olden
barnenveldt
was
he
not
i
think
the
prince
is
noble
at
heart
said
the
grand
pensionary
firmly
i
did
not
educate
him
to
be
like
prince
maurice
nor
like
his
father
but
jacob
de
witt
interrupted
sternly
he
should
have
been
treated
as
the
lord
cromwell
treated
the
faithless
stewart
if
the
united
provinces
were
to
keep
their
certainly
i
think
you
wrong
it
is
you
john
who
give
him
virtues
never
yet
found
in
the
hearts
of
princes
returned
the
old
republican
grimly
the
grand
pensionary
glanced
through
the
window
at
that
peaceful
picture
of
his
daughters
under
the
trees
what
do
you
seek
to
persuade
me
to
sir
he
asked
gently
i
seek
to
prevent
you
making
further
submission
to
the
prince
of
sir
i
have
never
submitted
to
him
nor
departed
from
the
perpetual
edict
you
know
how
i
fought
against
his
appointment
but
once
the
states
have
elected
him
i
must
help
not
hinder
him
in
his
jacob
de
witt
shook
his
head
of
a
brood
of
tyrants
he
said
in
a
low
voice
john
de
witt
raised
his
noble
mournful
face
until
he
proves
himself
otherwise
i
must
treat
the
prince
as
an
honourable
man
a
may
god
reward
you
for
it
for
william
of
orange
never
nevertheless
sir
it
is
necessary
that
i
see
the
why
demanded
the
old
man
vigorously
m
de
montbas
made
the
mistake
of
waiting
on
him
and
received
a
haughty
rebuff
for
his
pains
the
staff
of
the
army
is
arranged
and
there
you
have
been
too
just
beverningh
the
head
of
the
representatives
of
the
states
general
is
on
the
prince
s
side
he
was
interrupted
by
the
entry
of
van
ouvenaller
his
highness
the
prince
of
orange
the
grand
pensionary
turned
and
jacob
de
witt
rose
before
either
could
speak
the
prince
appeared
in
the
doorway
and
de
witt
s
secretary
after
holding
it
respectfully
open
for
him
bowed
and
withdrew
i
am
glad
to
see
your
highness
said
the
grand
pensionary
sincerely
william
touched
his
hat
without
raising
it
and
looked
at
jacob
de
witt
good
day
the
salutation
might
have
been
for
both
or
neither
so
indifferently
was
it
given
when
next
he
spoke
it
was
directly
to
the
older
man
we
have
not
met
for
some
time
de
the
old
republican
came
a
step
nearer
the
prince
loevenstein
was
in
the
minds
of
both
and
that
struggle
of
twenty
years
ago
when
the
family
of
de
witt
had
risen
to
greatness
on
the
fall
of
the
house
of
orange
their
eyes
met
william
very
slightly
smiled
he
was
dressed
more
richly
than
was
his
former
wont
he
wore
a
circular
mantle
of
dull
pink
velvet
turned
up
over
one
shoulder
showing
the
red
lining
the
coat
beneath
was
cut
away
over
a
black
velvet
waistcoat
the
heavily
fringed
baldric
supporting
the
sword
he
now
always
wore
his
dress
was
an
indication
of
his
altered
position
to
jacob
de
witt
his
whole
bearing
was
an
offence
i
am
leaving
the
hague
said
the
prince
with
a
courteous
but
unmistakable
malice
shall
i
not
have
your
good
wishes
first
the
old
man
drew
himself
erect
and
firmly
clasped
his
stick
i
pray
daily
for
the
success
and
safety
of
the
republic
he
answered
sternly
but
not
for
me
mynheer
asked
william
quietly
i
pray
that
your
highness
may
be
a
worthy
servant
of
the
country
that
owes
everything
to
my
with
a
gesture
of
unspeakable
pride
he
pointed
to
john
de
witt
ingratitude
is
the
vice
of
princes
he
said
strongly
may
god
preserve
your
highness
from
that
he
moved
to
the
door
turning
his
back
on
the
prince
with
the
air
of
one
who
has
administered
a
just
rebuke
john
de
witt
thought
that
the
prince
would
answer
and
answer
in
words
that
neither
could
forgive
but
william
was
silent
he
merely
raised
his
brows
a
little
and
waited
for
the
elder
de
witt
to
leave
the
grand
pensionary
proud
and
collected
as
ever
remained
where
the
prince
s
entrance
found
him
his
back
to
the
window
his
eyes
on
his
highness
the
moment
that
the
door
closed
william
spoke
you
must
forgive
me
for
disturbing
you
i
intended
waiting
on
your
highness
myself
immediately
replied
the
grand
pensionary
formally
their
high
mightinesses
consider
that
i
should
leave
the
hague
answered
william
in
the
same
tone
since
the
king
of
france
hath
joined
his
camp
at
john
de
witt
advanced
a
little
across
the
room
will
you
be
seated
highness
the
prince
took
the
chair
jacob
de
witt
had
quitted
he
still
wore
his
hat
it
heavily
shaded
his
face
that
was
even
for
him
pale
he
coughed
continually
as
he
spoke
and
his
eyes
were
unnaturally
brilliant
and
languid
lidded
we
have
not
seen
each
other
since
your
appointment
said
john
de
witt
and
i
am
glad
to
have
this
opportunity
of
speaking
to
your
william
laid
his
fringed
gloves
his
and
a
red
rose
he
was
carrying
down
on
the
table
beside
him
he
came
characteristically
straight
to
the
point
you
opposed
my
election
mynheer
you
have
contrived
to
restrict
my
authority
the
war
council
of
the
states
general
are
to
accompany
me
and
be
consulted
on
every
step
i
it
is
true
highness
was
the
grave
response
very
well
mynheer
what
i
have
obtained
has
been
in
spite
of
i
asked
your
help
and
you
refused
but
now
i
am
the
chief
of
the
army
you
of
the
state
what
now
he
fixed
his
dark
eyes
on
de
witt
s
face
now
highness
i
will
support
you
by
every
means
in
my
power
answered
john
de
witt
firmly
do
you
think
he
added
with
a
mournful
smile
that
i
am
of
so
paltry
or
jealous
a
nature
as
to
indulge
my
private
feelings
at
the
expense
of
the
public
welfare
and
safety
no
i
did
not
think
so
de
witt
answered
william
i
have
never
borne
personal
to
you
prince
i
of
myself
would
never
have
given
you
the
appointment
you
now
hold
but
since
you
do
hold
it
by
the
wish
of
the
country
i
will
help
you
willingly
and
very
thank
you
mynheer
said
william
still
formally
put
me
to
the
test
urged
the
grand
pensionary
if
there
is
anything
in
my
power
yes
interrupted
the
prince
i
have
come
a
second
time
to
ask
you
to
help
he
drew
a
paper
from
his
pocket
and
spread
it
out
on
the
table
this
is
the
list
of
the
staff
of
the
army
there
has
been
a
prolonged
contest
over
the
choice
he
smiled
not
very
pleasantly
and
then
coughed
pressing
his
lace
handkerchief
to
his
lips
john
de
witt
crossed
the
room
to
stand
beside
his
chair
william
read
from
his
list
the
two
prince
john
maurice
of
nassau
and
paul
wurtz
i
have
nothing
to
say
against
one
was
his
own
relative
the
other
devoted
to
his
cause
he
might
well
pass
these
names
commander
of
the
cavalry
the
rhyngrave
frederick
magnus
count
salm
governor
of
he
also
was
devoted
to
the
prince
william
made
no
comment
the
rhyngrave
s
two
john
of
weldeven
and
the
count
of
nassau
both
these
men
had
always
been
attached
to
the
house
of
orange
william
continued
commander
of
the
infantry
frederick
of
nassau
lord
of
zuylestein
his
count
königsmarck
and
william
of
aylva
master
general
of
ordinance
count
hornes
quartermaster
general
moyse
pain
et
vin
sergeant
majors
of
infantry
colonel
kirkpatrick
and
count
of
these
two
last
the
first
was
a
scotch
calvinist
bearing
a
bitter
hatred
to
the
english
government
the
second
a
near
relation
of
the
prince
through
his
grandmother
your
highness
has
nothing
to
say
against
these
gentlemen
asked
the
grand
pensionary
with
a
gentle
sarcasm
william
raised
his
eyes
from
the
paper
there
are
the
two
commissary
generals
of
the
cavalry
whom
i
have
not
yet
named
john
de
witt
s
eyes
narrowed
your
highness
means
the
viscount
de
montbas
and
colonel
bampfield
what
of
them
highness
william
coughed
those
two
positions
are
positions
of
great
trust
i
know
it
i
should
suggest
that
they
be
filled
john
de
witt
flushed
why
they
are
neither
of
them
men
whom
i
should
choose
to
have
under
your
highness
must
explain
briefly
i
do
not
trust
they
were
both
nominated
by
me
i
know
john
de
witt
drew
back
a
little
from
the
table
and
stood
looking
down
at
the
prince
with
an
almost
incredulous
expression
he
would
not
have
believed
that
william
would
have
the
audacity
to
take
exception
to
the
only
two
officers
of
republican
sympathies
on
his
staff
they
are
also
my
friends
highness
he
continued
with
some
haughtiness
i
know
that
mynheer
said
the
prince
but
you
are
not
i
think
of
such
a
paltry
nature
as
to
indulge
private
feelings
at
the
expense
of
the
welfare
of
the
the
tone
in
which
william
repeated
these
words
he
had
used
brought
the
colour
into
de
witt
s
face
both
these
soldiers
highness
are
men
whom
the
country
should
be
proud
of
they
have
my
entire
trust
and
i
am
sorry
answered
the
prince
dryly
what
have
you
against
them
highness
the
new
chief
of
the
army
kept
down
his
glance
colonel
bampfield
is
a
good
soldier
but
he
hath
the
misfortune
to
be
my
friend
broke
in
john
de
witt
with
some
feeling
he
is
a
swede
mynheer
a
mere
soldier
of
fortune
i
do
not
consider
him
fitted
for
a
post
of
and
de
montbas
you
always
disliked
him
yes
i
never
liked
him
mynheer
and
i
do
not
trust
not
trust
him
this
is
intolerable
your
highness
in
what
way
do
you
not
trust
him
he
is
a
but
a
protestant
and
since
many
years
in
our
still
mynheer
a
subject
of
the
king
of
france
answered
william
i
do
not
trust
i
repeat
the
vicomte
de
montbas
and
since
i
am
not
empowered
to
choose
my
own
officers
i
have
come
to
you
to
procure
his
dismissal
mynheer
de
with
that
the
captain
general
looked
steadily
at
the
grand
pensionary
who
was
both
angered
and
taken
aback
the
prince
s
request
seemed
to
him
both
bold
and
insolent
though
it
was
proffered
with
an
almost
disdainful
quiet
he
curbed
the
anger
that
rose
to
his
lips
and
kept
his
glance
averted
from
william
s
cool
and
slightly
mocking
face
m
de
montbas
is
my
friend
he
said
sternly
and
in
the
confidence
of
their
high
i
will
listen
to
nothing
against
him
no
nothing
he
repeated
in
some
agitation
somewhat
to
his
surprise
the
prince
replied
at
once
very
well
it
is
not
my
affair
i
have
made
my
request
and
been
he
lifted
his
brows
well
you
will
take
the
responsibility
as
you
do
for
every
other
action
of
the
civil
now
de
witt
looked
at
him
yes
i
will
take
the
responsibility
your
highness
he
answered
proudly
m
de
montbas
is
as
trusty
worthy
a
gentleman
as
any
under
your
highness
command
i
am
glad
that
you
will
answer
for
him
we
will
talk
no
more
of
it
replied
the
grand
pensionary
he
william
picked
up
the
red
rose
and
looked
at
it
languidly
my
brother
continued
de
witt
will
not
accompany
your
highness
as
he
hath
answered
the
appeal
of
the
states
general
to
go
as
deputy
plenipotentiary
to
the
the
prince
still
kept
his
eyes
on
the
flower
i
am
glad
mynheer
he
answered
m
cornelius
de
witt
and
i
are
not
likely
to
the
grand
pensionary
gave
him
a
long
and
searching
glance
god
forgive
this
stubborn
spirit
in
your
highness
he
said
william
faintly
smiled
mynheer
let
each
keep
to
his
you
need
not
have
grudged
me
the
sole
command
of
the
army
nor
have
appointed
these
deputies
to
accompany
it
is
for
your
own
good
the
undivided
weight
of
authority
was
too
heavy
a
burden
for
your
these
lawyers
know
nothing
of
war
answered
william
disdainfully
some
might
say
as
much
of
your
highness
i
for
one
who
think
you
should
have
served
before
you
i
know
that
mynheer
the
prince
laid
down
the
rose
you
have
no
trust
in
me
well
time
will
disclose
whether
or
no
i
justify
myself
in
this
that
i
i
shall
do
all
i
can
to
aid
your
the
generous
heart
of
de
witt
went
out
despite
everything
to
this
young
man
of
no
experience
and
of
delicate
health
suddenly
placed
in
this
arduous
and
difficult
post
he
blamed
the
ambition
that
had
asked
and
the
enthusiasm
that
had
given
the
supreme
command
to
william
of
orange
and
he
feared
the
result
for
the
united
provinces
but
he
saw
as
perhaps
no
one
else
could
see
the
thousand
difficulties
and
labours
that
must
beset
a
general
of
called
to
repel
a
foreign
invasion
with
insufficient
men
and
limited
authority
the
almost
impossible
task
that
faced
a
youth
who
had
never
seen
a
battle
and
now
must
come
to
the
touch
with
an
army
of
prodigious
strength
already
elated
with
glory
strong
in
prestige
and
generaled
by
the
most
famous
soldiers
in
the
world
on
this
impulse
of
reflection
de
witt
began
to
speak
he
told
the
prince
what
was
being
now
done
for
the
navy
the
army
the
fresh
levies
he
was
raising
the
soldiers
he
hoped
to
add
to
the
standing
he
said
what
he
could
to
encourage
and
hearten
william
listened
turning
the
rose
about
on
the
table
beside
him
once
or
twice
he
coughed
and
put
his
hand
to
his
head
when
john
de
witt
paused
he
looked
up
slowly
this
should
have
been
seen
to
long
ago
he
said
in
a
low
voice
what
do
you
mean
asked
the
grand
pensionary
quickly
william
rose
this
country
is
utterly
unprepared
for
the
navy
is
half
disarmed
the
army
of
a
miserable
strength
the
forts
insufficiently
those
who
have
been
governing
the
country
for
the
last
twenty
years
are
those
who
must
answer
for
it
you
are
blaming
me
william
caught
up
his
gloves
and
the
great
red
flower
i
am
the
servant
of
the
republic
the
commander
of
the
army
nothing
more
i
can
not
say
what
has
been
done
amiss
nor
what
rightly
doubtless
you
can
answer
for
your
conduct
mynheer
de
the
grand
pensionary
had
no
weapon
against
an
indirect
attack
veiled
in
courtesy
if
your
highness
will
let
me
know
your
requirements
i
will
see
that
their
high
mightinesses
meet
them
he
answered
simply
the
prince
flung
back
the
pink
velvet
cloak
and
replaced
the
list
of
his
officers
in
his
pocket
the
fading
reddish
sunlight
gathered
in
the
gold
hilt
of
his
sword
ran
down
the
length
of
the
shining
scabbard
and
shone
in
the
curls
that
lay
on
his
shoulders
you
must
believe
me
always
your
friend
he
said
lifting
his
brilliant
eyes
and
you
always
that
i
pray
for
your
success
and
that
i
will
in
every
way
assist
you
highness
responded
de
witt
sincerely
i
shall
remember
answered
william
and
hereafter
without
doubt
be
glad
to
remind
you
of
john
de
witt
encouraged
by
the
quiet
friendliness
of
the
other
s
tone
continued
with
impulsive
warmth
i
shall
work
in
the
cabinet
as
you
in
the
field
let
no
differences
estrange
us
for
have
we
not
the
same
object
in
view
the
same
hope
to
animate
us
the
same
fear
to
spur
us
on
god
who
has
us
both
in
his
hand
keep
you
prince
and
help
amen
said
william
and
may
he
guide
your
councils
de
the
grand
pensionary
held
out
his
fine
right
hand
william
clasped
it
his
eyes
perhaps
were
defiant
but
that
was
not
perceived
by
de
witt
i
will
write
to
your
highness
every
day
however
pressing
my
business
you
shall
hear
from
the
camp
they
parted
john
de
witt
sat
down
by
his
desk
one
hand
supporting
his
head
the
other
hanging
slackly
by
his
side
the
prince
had
not
been
gone
three
minutes
before
agneta
de
witt
entered
rather
breathlessly
father
who
was
that
who
has
just
left
you
de
witt
looked
up
surprised
dearest
the
prince
what
is
the
matter
oh
nought
but
i
passed
him
in
the
hall
and
he
gave
me
a
wicked
look
as
if
he
hated
me
and
all
of
chapter
vi
the
conspirators
the
prince
and
bromley
rode
straight
from
de
witt
s
house
to
the
groote
kerk
william
pulled
his
hat
over
his
eyes
his
person
was
not
as
yet
well
known
at
the
hague
and
though
his
beautiful
horse
attracted
notice
he
avoided
the
recognition
of
the
crowds
that
thronged
the
streets
leaving
bromley
without
he
entered
the
church
by
the
little
back
door
that
stood
always
open
bareheaded
he
opened
the
railing
round
the
entrance
and
passed
slowly
into
the
body
of
the
church
some
of
the
windows
were
shaded
by
green
curtains
through
others
the
sun
streamed
in
clear
golden
slanting
lines
across
the
whitewashed
walls
in
the
open
space
where
the
altar
once
stood
a
shaft
of
light
dazzled
and
fell
in
a
little
square
of
brilliance
on
the
stone
pavement
there
were
no
splendid
monuments
here
and
there
a
plain
tablet
grimly
decorated
with
a
skull
or
a
cluster
of
bones
yellowing
in
the
marble
in
every
place
along
the
stiff
pews
were
green
hassocks
a
and
a
bible
primly
arranged
round
the
stern
pulpit
the
seats
of
the
elders
with
their
larger
bibles
and
the
green
markers
hanging
from
between
the
heavy
covers
opposite
the
pulpit
was
the
plain
pew
belonging
to
the
princes
of
orange
here
the
late
stadtholder
had
worshipped
and
here
william
every
sunday
since
he
could
remember
had
sat
for
three
hours
in
the
morning
and
two
hours
in
the
afternoon
full
in
the
eye
of
the
preacher
with
his
open
bible
in
front
of
him
and
before
him
the
whitewashed
walls
and
pillars
the
straight
green
curtains
and
the
figure
of
the
pastor
in
his
black
gown
and
bands
preaching
the
doctrines
of
john
calvin
he
could
not
recall
having
ever
missed
a
service
here
while
he
was
at
the
hague
sometimes
his
head
had
ached
so
that
he
could
hardly
hold
it
up
but
he
had
always
sat
erect
with
his
eyes
on
the
preacher
even
when
he
was
a
child
and
could
not
understand
the
long
words
used
since
the
declaration
of
war
the
states
had
ordained
wednesday
for
fasting
and
prayer
and
the
prince
had
invariably
attended
but
with
his
household
now
the
day
before
his
departure
to
the
army
he
came
for
the
first
time
to
the
church
alone
he
mounted
into
his
pew
and
knelt
in
his
place
his
sword
making
an
incongruous
rattle
on
the
wooden
seat
he
folded
his
hands
on
the
front
of
the
pew
where
the
bible
rested
hid
his
face
in
them
and
knelt
so
motionless
the
extraordinary
silence
of
a
place
still
in
the
midst
of
noise
filled
the
church
the
faint
echo
of
the
clamour
of
the
busy
city
without
seemed
to
come
from
a
long
way
off
the
sunshine
fell
on
the
blank
walls
with
a
dreary
sense
of
remoteness
clamour
and
sunshine
alike
could
only
enter
here
by
a
guilty
stealth
they
seemed
to
belong
to
other
regions
when
the
clock
struck
it
sounded
loud
and
sombre
like
a
note
of
warning
or
reproof
and
echoed
gloomily
down
the
empty
aisles
and
bare
altar
chapel
when
at
last
the
prince
rose
he
remained
in
his
place
gazing
down
the
grim
whiteness
of
the
church
his
right
hand
resting
on
the
bible
he
was
very
pale
and
there
was
a
look
of
pain
about
his
eyes
for
a
while
he
stood
so
the
pink
mantle
rising
and
falling
with
his
laboured
breathing
then
he
turned
sharply
some
one
had
entered
the
church
at
first
he
could
hear
only
footsteps
but
presently
three
men
came
round
the
pillars
the
prince
picked
up
his
gloves
his
hat
and
the
rose
and
descended
from
the
pew
closing
it
after
him
as
he
stepped
into
the
aisle
he
came
face
to
face
with
the
newcomers
the
recognition
was
instantaneous
he
knew
them
for
the
three
who
had
stepped
out
upon
him
from
the
mist
at
scheveningen
they
fell
back
respectfully
in
silence
william
not
pleased
at
the
meeting
passed
on
but
when
he
reached
the
covered
entrance
he
found
that
they
had
followed
him
with
the
obvious
intent
of
speaking
the
prince
at
once
turned
and
putting
on
his
hat
faced
them
the
foremost
was
a
very
young
man
fair
and
eager
fashionably
dressed
the
other
two
older
and
it
seemed
of
a
meaner
station
you
know
me
asked
william
your
highness
we
well
demanded
the
prince
he
knew
these
men
for
conspirators
against
the
government
and
that
the
youth
who
spoke
was
jacob
van
der
graef
the
author
of
to
every
faithful
the
pamphlet
said
to
have
stung
john
de
witt
the
most
among
the
many
violent
attacks
made
on
him
he
knew
also
that
they
were
orangists
whose
enthusiasm
was
as
genuine
as
it
was
unbalanced
and
foolishly
directed
knowing
and
recalling
this
he
deigned
to
stop
and
listen
highness
said
jacob
van
der
graef
adoration
in
his
face
we
are
loyal
subjects
of
yours
ah
william
caught
him
up
you
the
son
of
a
magistrate
mynheer
van
der
graef
venture
to
say
that
we
would
venture
more
returned
one
of
the
others
van
bruyn
a
lawyer
take
care
my
friends
said
the
prince
but
the
expression
of
his
eyes
rewarded
them
prince
said
van
der
graef
in
a
low
excited
voice
we
would
die
for
you
any
one
of
us
and
there
are
others
de
witt
treats
you
vilely
he
is
a
traitor
to
his
country
while
he
lives
your
highness
will
never
come
to
your
rights
the
united
provinces
will
not
much
longer
bear
his
speak
a
little
more
moderately
my
child
or
you
will
get
into
trouble
said
the
prince
slightly
smiling
the
young
student
sank
to
one
knee
on
the
flagstones
what
can
i
do
to
serve
your
highness
he
asked
passionately
be
prudent
for
your
own
sake
returned
william
m
de
witt
is
still
the
other
two
broke
in
he
is
a
traitor
nay
said
the
prince
he
is
a
good
a
traitor
to
your
house
highness
and
to
the
i
do
not
say
so
answered
william
but
it
seems
he
is
not
the
people
hate
i
wonder
why
the
prince
s
smile
deepened
because
they
love
your
highness
i
love
the
united
provinces
mynheer
jacob
van
der
graef
rose
m
de
witt
must
go
he
cried
go
cæsar
s
way
i
would
play
brutus
for
your
highness
william
coloured
and
drew
a
deep
breath
it
is
dangerous
to
be
a
fool
in
these
times
de
witt
is
not
he
turned
away
quickly
opened
the
door
and
stepped
out
into
the
sunny
streets
who
were
those
went
in
but
now
asked
bromley
curiously
as
his
master
mounted
some
of
those
who
stir
the
country
against
de
they
followed
you
into
the
church
i
think
why
highness
to
speak
to
ah
they
wished
a
little
encouragement
nodded
bromley
they
are
fanatics
returned
the
prince
they
call
de
witt
any
vile
name
that
occurs
to
them
and
believe
what
they
can
they
be
of
any
use
to
your
highness
asked
bromley
the
prince
let
the
spur
touch
his
horse
s
side
use
to
me
he
looked
at
his
gentleman
sideways
what
use
should
they
be
to
me
were
i
de
witt
i
would
police
the
hague
you
think
these
malcontents
are
dangerous
highness
to
the
government
there
is
no
one
so
hated
as
a
usurper
bromley
when
the
people
who
gave
him
his
power
become
tired
of
does
your
highness
think
de
witt
is
hated
in
that
fashion
you
must
see
that
he
is
not
loved
answered
the
prince
it
is
curious
too
remarked
the
englishman
it
is
said
william
for
as
i
reminded
van
der
graef
but
now
de
witt
is
a
good
bromley
glanced
quickly
at
his
master
he
was
not
a
man
of
quick
perceptions
but
the
prince
s
mocking
intonation
could
not
altogether
escape
him
remind
me
continued
william
that
when
next
i
write
to
de
witt
i
mention
that
he
had
better
take
precautions
against
what
highness
assassination
said
the
prince
laconically
then
before
bromley
could
exclaim
he
asked
abruptly
you
have
not
heard
from
arnheim
from
triglandt
no
i
should
have
liked
to
have
seen
him
before
i
left
the
hague
remarked
the
prince
with
such
an
effect
of
calmness
that
bromley
could
not
tell
if
any
feeling
was
behind
the
words
or
no
they
had
almost
reached
the
palace
and
were
riding
briskly
under
the
lime
trees
that
bordered
the
canal
when
a
band
of
young
men
advancing
from
a
side
street
crossed
their
path
and
brought
them
to
a
sudden
halt
a
crowd
accompanied
the
band
the
foremost
of
whom
was
carrying
an
orange
flag
a
white
one
displayed
below
it
this
bore
the
inscription
orange
op
witte
william
was
annoyed
he
never
loved
the
mob
in
any
form
or
mood
he
was
utterly
indifferent
to
popularity
which
he
rated
too
keenly
at
its
true
value
he
felt
no
gratitude
to
these
people
for
their
enthusiasm
they
had
suffered
john
de
witt
for
twenty
years
despite
their
and
their
shouting
they
suffered
him
still
therefore
he
sat
silent
reining
in
his
horse
on
the
causeway
of
the
canal
and
waiting
for
the
crowd
to
pass
but
the
beauty
of
the
animal
and
the
richness
of
the
rider
s
dress
did
not
escape
the
attention
of
the
orangists
they
looked
at
him
he
was
of
too
marked
an
appearance
to
escape
recognition
long
some
knew
him
at
once
they
stopped
hesitated
swayed
the
prince
the
word
went
round
then
every
hat
and
cap
was
off
long
live
your
highness
god
keep
your
highness
william
touched
his
beaver
thank
you
my
friends
he
said
gravely
they
crowded
round
him
men
women
and
bromley
felt
a
startled
amazement
to
see
the
half
sobbing
deep
intensity
of
their
enthusiasm
as
if
love
of
home
of
country
and
god
were
each
and
all
expressed
in
their
passionate
devotion
to
this
young
man
like
all
reserved
people
they
did
not
lack
expression
when
they
were
touched
or
roused
william
accepted
their
homage
calmly
his
attention
seemed
to
be
given
to
his
horse
that
fretted
by
the
pressure
curveted
and
backed
bringing
out
his
rider
s
horsemanship
and
does
your
highness
go
to
the
war
asked
one
eagerly
ay
answered
william
looking
down
at
them
at
that
they
shouted
anew
and
roundly
cursed
the
french
hearing
that
the
prince
slightly
smiled
we
will
not
see
king
louis
at
mass
in
the
groote
kerk
eh
he
said
not
while
your
highness
lives
shouted
the
young
man
with
the
flag
william
s
brilliant
glance
rested
on
him
thank
he
glanced
round
the
eager
faces
thank
you
all
for
your
they
began
to
call
frenzied
curses
on
the
mm
de
witt
william
checked
them
get
back
to
your
homes
he
said
and
pray
god
to
bless
the
cause
i
have
in
hand
to
protect
the
liberty
of
this
country
and
the
protestant
an
old
man
came
forward
and
kissed
the
prince
s
stirrup
a
girl
was
sobbing
out
loud
bromley
saw
william
go
very
pale
he
touched
his
hat
again
and
pressed
on
they
fell
back
as
the
great
horse
moved
but
they
followed
him
to
the
palace
gate
blessing
him
a
smile
not
wholly
pleasant
curled
the
prince
s
lip
these
people
who
had
forsaken
his
house
to
obey
a
burgher
citizen
cursed
their
idealist
lawyer
the
man
of
peace
at
the
first
touch
of
danger
and
turned
frantically
to
the
son
of
their
ancient
rulers
the
man
of
action
little
real
trust
had
they
in
maxims
and
the
strength
of
quiet
godliness
when
it
came
to
real
issues
they
cried
for
the
sword
and
the
leader
what
did
john
de
witt
s
twenty
years
of
service
avail
him
now
they
called
him
a
traitor
they
wanted
a
prince
and
a
soldier
even
at
the
price
of
losing
their
liberty
william
of
orange
would
not
be
content
with
what
john
de
witt
had
taken
a
modest
salary
and
the
rank
of
a
humble
citizen
sovereign
power
was
his
price
he
might
save
his
country
but
he
would
rule
it
as
his
ancestors
had
done
and
with
augmented
powers
not
the
servant
of
the
republic
like
john
de
witt
but
her
master
and
they
were
very
willing
to
put
their
liberty
beneath
his
feet
his
face
wore
its
least
pleasant
expression
as
he
entered
his
palace
thinking
of
these
things
bromley
was
silent
as
always
when
his
master
seemed
in
one
of
his
coldly
cynical
moods
the
prince
was
usually
in
a
sardonic
humour
after
he
had
been
openly
acclaimed
by
the
crowd
it
pointed
perhaps
the
difference
between
his
actual
position
and
the
one
he
should
have
filled
bentinck
was
abroad
taking
farewell
of
friends
he
was
to
accompany
the
prince
to
the
front
william
dined
alone
afterwards
he
wrote
a
brief
but
kind
letter
to
the
princess
dowager
and
one
to
cornelius
triglandt
at
arnheim
he
gave
these
for
dispatch
to
bromley
who
was
wandering
about
the
dreary
palace
between
excitement
and
depression
it
was
now
about
eight
william
dismissed
him
we
leave
at
six
morning
so
early
highness
i
wish
to
avoid
the
crowds
i
shall
not
want
you
before
then
thus
left
to
his
own
resources
bromley
bethought
him
of
some
french
players
now
performing
at
the
hague
since
the
declaration
of
war
they
had
taken
fright
at
the
temper
of
the
people
and
announced
their
early
departure
but
they
were
giving
and
bromley
had
long
wanted
to
see
them
he
persuaded
heenvliet
to
accompany
him
it
was
their
last
chance
they
agreed
with
a
laugh
who
could
tell
if
either
of
them
would
see
the
hague
again
the
prince
went
upstairs
to
his
silent
rooms
opened
the
windows
on
the
still
spring
night
and
drew
the
curtains
two
candles
on
the
mantelshelf
and
two
on
the
desk
lit
the
room
between
the
last
stood
the
red
rose
in
a
crystal
glass
william
sat
down
at
the
desk
and
unlocked
the
drawers
he
employed
no
secretary
his
letters
were
always
in
his
own
hand
no
confidant
was
tolerated
in
his
intimate
affairs
drawing
the
candle
nearer
to
him
with
a
little
movement
he
commenced
writing
the
letters
that
he
hoped
and
intended
should
secure
allies
for
the
republic
the
first
was
to
the
emperor
he
wrote
it
slowly
translating
it
into
spanish
from
the
rough
draft
he
had
before
him
the
second
in
german
which
he
wrote
with
ease
was
to
the
elector
of
brandenburg
in
it
he
set
forth
the
need
of
the
united
provinces
and
passionately
implored
help
in
the
name
of
their
common
religion
these
finished
he
set
himself
to
write
both
to
charles
of
england
with
the
object
of
detaching
him
from
the
french
alliance
and
to
sir
william
temple
these
letters
that
he
composed
carefully
in
english
occupied
him
a
considerable
time
when
he
at
length
sealed
them
it
was
past
midnight
he
gave
a
half
glance
at
the
clock
coughed
and
leant
back
wearily
in
his
chair
it
was
absolutely
silent
a
slight
but
sweet
breeze
filled
the
room
the
chimes
of
the
groote
kerk
rang
clearly
with
an
iron
clang
into
the
night
breaking
the
stillness
harshly
william
snuffed
the
candles
and
began
to
sort
his
papers
they
were
already
carefully
arranged
and
marked
some
he
burnt
in
the
candle
some
he
put
in
his
pocket
the
rest
he
locked
away
from
an
inner
drawer
he
took
a
roll
of
maps
and
a
bundle
of
notes
and
spread
them
out
before
him
on
the
polished
surface
of
the
desk
they
were
plans
of
the
yssel
and
rhine
and
diagrams
of
the
forts
protecting
these
rivers
referring
to
the
notes
he
wrote
under
each
fort
the
number
of
men
of
guns
and
the
nature
of
the
defences
in
some
cases
he
made
calculations
and
drawings
of
scarps
and
counterscarps
half
moons
and
bastions
he
dwelt
a
long
time
over
maestricht
the
key
of
the
entrance
to
the
netherlands
and
wrote
across
the
plan
that
the
garrison
must
be
strengthened
the
rhyngrave
frederick
magnus
commanded
there
the
prince
seeing
the
weakness
of
his
men
wrote
to
him
and
desired
him
to
raise
levies
from
among
the
surrounding
peasantry
as
i
can
send
you
no
more
soldiers
and
the
loss
of
maestricht
would
be
almost
a
fatal
then
he
looked
again
at
the
list
he
had
shown
de
witt
and
wrote
his
comments
beside
the
name
of
each
officer
when
he
came
to
that
of
the
viscount
de
montbas
he
hesitated
as
if
he
would
have
liked
to
cross
it
out
but
finally
left
it
opposite
a
blank
next
he
examined
the
names
of
the
deputies
appointed
by
the
government
to
accompany
him
in
the
campaign
he
was
not
even
to
move
the
army
without
the
consent
of
this
council
of
war
and
as
he
glanced
down
their
names
his
eyes
darkened
at
the
thought

cornelius
de
witt
having
been
transferred
to
the
fleet
beverningh
was
left
head
of
the
council
and
the
prince
could
twist
beverningh
once
a
loyal
supporter
of
the
grand
pensionary
round
his
finger
nevertheless
he
did
not
forgive
de
witt
this
attempt
to
limit
his
authority
and
supervise
his
actions
his
bitterness
against
him
was
further
revived
when
he
came
to
look
over
the
of
the
forces
with
which
he
was
to
repel
invasion
less
than
a
year
ago
john
de
witt
in
pursuance
of
his
peace
policy
had
disbanded
a
considerable
portion
of
the
army
regarding
politics
as
a
science
he
had
overlooked
the
importance
of
war
he
could
not
believe
the
policy
of
louvois
would
find
expression
in
the
armies
of
louis
subsequently
he
had
done
what
he
could
to
repair
the
error
but
it
was
not
one
to
be
easily
made
good
nor
one
to
be
lightly
forgiven
by
the
young
man
who
sat
now
looking
at
the
list
of
his
inadequate
forces
thousand
five
hundred
and
foot
two
thousand
and
six
hundred
horse
many
ill
trained
several
regiments
not
paid
constituted
the
standing
army
of
the
republic
the
grand
pensionary
s
urgent
appeal
to
the
states
general
had
resulted
in
the
promise
of
seventeen
thousand
men
not
yet
raised
william
laid
the
paper
down
and
put
his
hand
to
his
aching
forehead
thousand
men
and
louis
had
left
paris
with
a
hundred
thousand
not
to
speak
of
the
army
already
in
lorraine
a
hundred
thousand
men
and
condé
turenne
vauban
and
ah
de
witt
this
is
what
your
love
for
peace
hath
brought
us
to
muttered
william
between
his
teeth
he
turned
his
keen
eyes
to
the
list
of
the
other
forces
at
the
disposal
of
the
united
provinces
the
fleet
under
the
command
of
de
ruyter
comprised
a
hundred
ships
thirty
twenty
thousand
sailors
and
five
thousand
marines
with
this
force
de
ruyter
who
had
already
escorted
the
india
convoy
safely
into
the
texel
had
to
confront
the
combined
ships
of
england
and
france
william
pushed
back
his
chair
and
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
dark
square
of
window
his
mind
was
busy
with
a
question
that
was
no
part
of
the
business
of
the
captain
general
the
financial
position
of
the
country
the
expenses
of
a
campaign
could
not
be
less
than
gulden
for
four
months
the
states
had
voted
and
for
the
fleet
the
national
debt
was
seventeen
millions
the
country
was
already
taxed
to
the
on
the
back
of
the
list
of
deputies
william
made
a
quick
calculation
of
his
own
private
fortune
an
estimate
of
his
jewels
estates
and
property
his
serenely
quiet
life
had
enabled
him
to
accumulate
his
revenues
his
credit
was
good
he
could
raise
large
sums
in
amsterdam
on
his
mere
note
of
hand
and
he
knew
some
german
bankers
who
would
he
thought
advance
him
he
rose
at
last
pushing
back
his
disordered
hair
it
was
nearly
four
bentinck
must
have
returned
the
prince
rather
wondered
that
he
had
not
come
to
him
there
still
remained
some
work
to
do
copying
and
docketing
and
the
prince
weary
and
racked
with
a
headache
wished
bentinck
here
to
help
taking
up
a
candle
he
went
out
on
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
listened
intently
he
seemed
the
only
person
awake
in
the
palace
not
a
sound
a
footfall
or
a
breath
disturbed
the
quiet
the
prince
remembering
a
book
he
wished
to
take
with
him
went
lightly
down
to
the
library
resigned
to
the
fact
that
he
must
return
and
finish
his
work
himself
under
the
library
door
a
faint
light
showed
the
prince
thought
at
once
of
bentinck
and
opened
the
heavy
door
a
couple
of
candles
burning
on
the
table
between
the
windows
revealed
a
man
sitting
before
them
busily
writing
at
the
sound
of
the
opening
door
he
looked
quickly
up
your
highness
he
exclaimed
and
rose
hastily
ah
van
mander
said
william
slightly
surprised
where
is
bentinck
gone
to
bed
your
and
the
others
i
think
every
one
is
abed
your
the
prince
smiled
save
you
and
he
came
farther
into
the
room
why
do
you
sit
up
mynheer
van
mander
florent
coloured
i
could
not
sleep
william
looked
at
him
sharply
what
are
you
doing
copying
some
letters
bentinck
gave
me
well
finish
the
prince
crossed
to
the
far
end
of
the
room
held
his
light
up
to
the
bookshelves
and
took
down
the
volume
a
latin
work
on
tactics
that
he
sought
i
have
finished
highness
said
florent
in
a
humble
voice
he
fixed
his
eyes
ardently
and
half
pleadingly
on
the
prince
william
turned
with
the
book
in
his
hand
and
looked
at
him
florent
had
an
instant
and
haunting
picture
of
the
prince
his
suit
and
black
jet
embroidered
waistcoat
glimmered
into
points
of
light
in
the
glow
of
the
candle
he
held
a
little
diamond
brooch
in
the
lace
at
his
throat
sent
out
long
changing
rays
of
blue
and
green
he
looked
colourless
and
ill
his
eyes
were
heavy
lidded
and
shadowed
underneath
the
curls
on
his
forehead
disordered
and
damp
he
breathed
with
noticeable
labour
as
if
utterly
exhausted
is
your
highness
not
taking
any
repose
asked
florent
timidly
william
turned
towards
the
door
annibal
erit
brevi
ad
portas
he
said
with
a
slight
smile
florent
stood
mute
if
you
will
you
can
help
me
added
the
prince
i
have
still
somewhat
to
do
will
you
come
upstairs
van
mander
blushed
violently
he
did
not
say
anything
but
william
s
keen
glance
seemed
satisfied
with
his
expression
and
demeanour
i
do
not
wish
to
wake
bentinck
continued
the
prince
we
have
still
an
hour
he
pulled
out
his
watch
florent
extinguished
his
candles
and
took
that
the
prince
held
preceding
him
with
it
up
the
wide
dark
stairs
when
they
reached
william
s
apartment
the
prince
gave
florent
some
of
the
notes
he
had
been
writing
and
bade
him
copy
them
he
himself
walked
up
and
down
stopping
now
and
then
to
look
out
of
the
window
on
to
the
night
where
the
darkness
lifted
slowly
florent
hardly
raised
his
eyes
from
the
desk
the
scratching
of
his
quill
and
the
prince
s
light
step
were
the
only
sounds
at
last
william
threw
himself
into
the
deep
chair
by
the
hearth
and
sat
there
so
still
that
florent
thought
him
asleep
but
looking
up
from
his
finished
task
he
saw
that
the
prince
s
eyes
were
open
and
shining
with
a
bright
lustre
as
florent
gazed
at
him
he
moved
and
glanced
at
the
black
clock
between
the
candles
on
the
mantelpiece
it
was
well
past
five
and
the
steadily
increasing
glow
of
dawn
in
the
chamber
made
the
show
yellow
and
feeble
the
prince
rose
and
came
over
to
florent
s
seat
have
you
completed
that
yes
will
you
put
up
these
papers
he
pointed
to
them
that
letter
to
the
king
of
england
is
for
gabriel
sylvius
who
will
come
for
it
will
you
remain
here
till
i
return
without
waiting
for
an
answer
he
went
into
his
bedchamber
and
closed
the
door
florent
arranged
the
papers
as
he
was
told
then
put
out
the
unnecessary
candles
and
got
to
his
feet
stretching
himself
the
freshness
of
the
early
wind
was
marvellous
the
secretary
went
to
the
wide
open
window
before
him
were
the
trees
in
their
ideal
freshness
and
the
green
walks
of
the
palace
garden
beyond
the
turrets
and
towers
of
the
hague
the
birds
were
beginning
their
lusty
untaught
harmony
and
a
veil
was
being
lifted
from
the
heavens
disclosing
the
blue
of
a
fair
spring
day
florent
rested
his
head
against
the
mullions
and
drew
a
troubled
breath
war
the
beginning
of
war
what
was
it
like
war
at
charleroi
lay
a
great
army
coming
nearer
from
chatham
and
from
brest
huge
armaments
advanced
a
curious
fact
to
dwell
on
here
looking
over
the
peaceful
hague
well
he
florent
van
mander
was
no
patriot
yet
it
was
strange
to
think
of
this
country
of
his
not
long
ago
the
arbitrator
of
europe
the
greatest
maritime
power
in
the
world
the
richest
most
prosperous
in
commerce
fallen
to
a
footstool
for
the
french
even
a
hero
could
not
prevent
it
he
thought
and
the
republic
owned
no
hero
only
john
de
witt
who
was
a
good
man
and
william
of
orange
who
was
playing
his
own
this
very
night
he
had
written
a
letter
to
his
uncle
charles
perhaps
it
was
a
guarantee
that
louis
troops
should
not
find
their
conquest
difficult
in
consideration
of
a
price
florent
smiled
bitterly
yet
he
told
himself
that
only
a
fool
would
act
since
the
country
was
lost
one
must
snatch
what
might
be
from
the
wreck
yet
yet
however
the
prince
did
it
very
annibal
erit
brevi
ad
portas
he
had
said
and
as
if
the
danger
touched
him
nearly
florent
turned
restlessly
from
the
window
as
william
from
the
inner
chamber
under
his
pink
mantle
he
wore
black
armour
and
he
held
under
his
arm
his
helmet
mounted
with
a
black
feather
his
sword
was
strapped
to
his
waist
and
he
supported
it
with
his
right
hand
his
bright
hair
and
his
pale
face
were
in
curious
contrast
with
the
dull
shining
mail
he
placed
his
steel
gauntlets
and
his
helmet
down
on
a
chair
and
crossed
to
the
desk
taking
up
the
papers
florent
had
left
there
ready
for
him
go
and
see
if
bentinck
is
abroad
he
commanded
and
he
unfolded
the
plan
of
the
line
of
the
yssel
and
gazed
at
it
florent
left
the
room
to
return
almost
immediately
with
bentinck
who
had
slept
well
all
night
and
was
as
gay
as
if
he
were
starting
for
a
hunt
in
guelders
william
gave
him
a
charming
smile
and
rolled
up
the
map
m
de
zuylestein
is
below
with
his
regiment
of
bentinck
who
was
also
in
armour
bent
and
kissed
his
master
s
hand
i
think
you
will
already
find
the
streets
full
of
people
they
had
best
keep
their
cheers
for
our
return
answered
william
briefly
florent
was
observing
him
closely
he
wished
that
he
might
have
accompanied
bentinck
to
the
war
the
empty
palace
was
no
alluring
the
prince
wonderfully
softened
his
discontent
by
entrusting
him
with
the
letters
lying
on
the
little
desk
and
giving
him
his
instructions
for
gabriel
sylvius
who
had
not
yet
arrived
then
he
said
nodded
and
went
downstairs
in
the
hall
he
took
unconcerned
leave
of
the
rest
of
his
household
heenvliet
renswoude
boreel
handing
to
the
last
the
keys
of
his
desk
by
now
the
sun
was
bright
and
strong
lying
in
scattered
patches
of
gold
on
the
grass
beneath
the
palace
trees
the
prince
gave
his
helmet
to
an
officer
and
put
on
his
hat
bromley
came
to
say
his
horse
was
waiting
william
was
leaving
the
palace
when
he
stopped
at
a
sudden
recollection
and
mounted
the
stairs
when
a
moment
later
he
returned
he
wore
a
red
rose
fastened
into
the
brooch
of
his
cravat
are
you
ready
highness
asked
bentinck
the
prince
stepped
out
into
the
sunlight
he
coughed
and
closed
his
eyes
for
a
second
as
if
shaken
with
pain
the
clock
of
the
groote
kerk
struck
six
florent
van
mander
watched
the
little
cavalcade
ride
away
chapter
vii
the
policy
of
de
witt
mynheer
gaspard
fagel
was
roused
by
persistent
knocking
on
his
door
he
sat
up
in
his
bed
and
cursed
roundly
he
was
working
almost
to
the
limit
of
his
strength
and
contenting
himself
with
about
four
hours
rest
and
his
one
feeling
was
rage
at
being
disturbed
he
pulled
back
the
curtains
and
shouted
angrily
come
in
in
god
s
name
his
servant
entered
in
hastily
garments
what
is
the
matter
demanded
gaspard
fagel
sharply
his
vexation
giving
place
to
alarm
mynheer
the
grand
pensionary
is
below
cried
the
servant
oh
mynheer
is
it
the
french
and
shall
we
all
be
murdered
in
our
beds
be
quiet
you
fool
fagel
sprang
on
to
the
floor
get
me
my
de
witt
below
by
the
aid
of
the
light
that
the
man
held
he
glanced
at
his
watch
on
the
table
by
his
bed
it
was
four
o
clock
yes
mynheer
he
must
see
you
at
once
he
is
he
agitated
asked
the
secretary
of
the
united
provinces
snatching
up
his
slippers
he
is
the
same
as
ever
mynheer
but
something
dreadful
must
have
happened
to
bring
him
here
at
this
gaspard
fagel
was
of
the
same
opinion
nothing
but
an
affair
of
great
moment
could
have
brought
de
witt
to
see
him
and
at
this
hour
it
is
the
french
repeated
the
servant
who
seemed
utterly
confounded
put
that
candle
down
or
you
will
set
the
house
on
fire
with
your
trembling
said
fagel
struggling
into
his
clothes
and
don
t
talk
so
much
of
the
french
the
prince
of
orange
is
between
us
and
m
de
witt
must
have
heard
from
his
highness
hold
your
tongue
fagel
snatched
up
the
candle
and
get
back
to
your
bed
he
said
angrily
and
see
to
it
you
rouse
no
one
with
that
he
left
the
room
and
half
dressed
clad
in
a
blue
flowered
descended
to
the
parlour
where
de
witt
awaited
him
a
candle
hastily
lit
stood
on
the
table
it
but
feebly
illumined
the
small
handsomely
appointed
room
standing
by
the
mantelshelf
wrapped
in
a
black
velvet
mantle
was
the
grand
pensionary
he
held
his
hat
and
his
gloves
in
his
hand
he
was
pallid
his
lips
tightly
drawn
his
eyes
narrowed
with
an
intent
expression
good
morning
said
fagel
a
little
flushed
and
breathless
ah
mynheer
john
de
witt
appeared
perfectly
composed
he
spoke
quietly
ill
news
asked
the
secretary
of
the
united
provinces
he
was
something
embarrassed
by
the
sudden
presence
under
his
roof
of
the
man
who
was
both
his
adversary
and
his
rival
will
you
not
be
seated
added
fagel
the
grand
pensionary
took
the
chair
nearest
to
him
i
have
come
directly
here
from
the
binnenhof
he
said
fagel
lit
the
other
candles
on
the
table
and
looked
at
de
witt
over
the
flames
you
have
had
bad
news
he
hazarded
puckering
his
brows
yes

i
the
secretary

at
the
tassels
of
the
blue
from
de
ruyter
no
i

fagel
s
voice
came
somewhat
hoarsely
no

from
the
de

raised
his
head
sharply
as
he
spoke
and
regarded
the
other
man
across
the
wavering
lights
and
shadows
their
eyes
met
well
demanded
fagel
john
de

raised
his

his
breast

gaspard
fagel
he
sank
into
the
chair
beside
him
his
flowing
open
over
his
shirt
oh

there
was
no
change
in
john
de

pale
proud

the
french
hardly

fagel
put
his
hand
to
his
brow
it
seemed
as

hair

exclaimed

incredulous
m

of
cavalry

cut
to
pieces

ah
you

a
creditable
beginning

are
already

with
what

will
defend

the

is
defending

every
nerve
already
to

is
to
be
done
god
hath
been
pleased
to
put
us
in
bitter
what
do
you
propose
mynheer
what
shall
we
do
it
was
a
long
time
since
gaspard
fagel
had
deigned
to
ask
the
grand
pensionary
s
advice
but
in
the
hour
of
terror
and
alarm
the
weaker
nature
threw
aside
pride
and
recognised
the
stronger
de
witt
uncovered
his
eyes
and
raised
his
head
i
have
come
here
to
you
now
mynheer
with
my
to
me
john
de
witt
gave
him
a
steady
mournful
glance
you
are
no
longer
my
friend
i
know
mynheer
protested
the
secretary
in
a
fluster
of
agitation
that
is
understood
between
us
i
come
to
you
as
to
the
chief
of
the
orange
party
in
the
absence
of
his
these
two
had
been
friends
once
and
allies
before
gaspard
fagel
had
been
led
by
ambition
to
envy
the
position
of
the
grand
pensionary
and
serve
the
prince
at
john
de
witt
s
calm
sad
recognition
of
their
estrangement
and
its
motive
the
secretary
was
silent
you
represent
the
party
that
has
always
been
for
war
fagel
as
i
that
for
peace
you
have
perhaps
more
influence
in
the
assembly
than
i
m
de
witt
the
grand
pensionary
silenced
him
it
is
fagel
wiped
his
lips
what
do
you
want
of
me
your
help
in
the
for
what
end
for
the
first
time
john
de
witt
showed
some
agitation
that
we
may
possibly
under
god
s
help
avert
the
disaster
that
threatens
in
what
manner
by
endeavouring
to
obtain
peace
from
the
king
of
never
cried
gaspard
fagel
never
john
de
witt
answered
with
suppressed
passion
orsoy
rhynberg
burick
and
wesel
have
the
secretary
made
no
answer
i
see
no
means
of
saving
the
united
provinces
now
the
secretary
looked
at
him
defiantly
and
rose
resting
one
hand
on
the
table
between
them
well
mynheer
the
republic
hath
before
this
been
reduced
to
even
greater
extremities
and
by
god
s
help
been
saved
if
he
saved
us
from
the
tyranny
of
philip
surely
he
will
preserve
us
from
the
tyranny
of
god
gave
our
ancestors
the
courage
and
resource
to
save
themselves
i
do
not
see
these
virtues
among
us
would
you
despair
of
the
vessel
before
she
is
on
the
rocks
cried
gaspard
fagel
stoutly
but
in
his
heart
he
was
frightened
never
before
had
he
known
john
de
witt
speak
despondently
for
my
part
he
added
i
will
do
anything
in
my
power
to
bring
her
safe
to
then
you
will
help
me
john
de
witt
spoke
eagerly
i
do
not
know
i
do
not
what
do
you
intend
doing
fagel
took
a
hasty
turn
about
the
room
his
hands
clasped
behind
him
under
the
blue
i
intend
to
propose
in
the
assembly
that
envoys
be
at
once
sent
to
the
king
of
france
to
request
his
terms
and
to
offer
him
everything
so
that
we
keep
our
final
have
you
no
trust
in
the
prince
demanded
the
secretary
trying
to
hearten
himself
into
a
confidence
he
could
not
feel
the
prince
can
not
do
the
impossible
answered
john
de
witt
dryly
ah
you
blame
him
for
the
passage
of
the
rhine
cried
fagel
on
a
note
of
challenge
no
he
has
been
but
a
few
days
with
the
army
he
has
not
proved
the
grand
pensionary
spoke
sternly
we
need
other
and
you
wish
to
open
negotiations
with
the
french
repeated
gaspard
fagel
as
the
head
of
the
party
opposing
de
witt
in
the
councils
of
the
state
fagel
was
bound
to
vote
for
war
the
grand
pensionary
had
not
expected
to
find
him
tractable
yet
by
alarming
him
he
hoped
to
gain
him
eventually
you
can
not
refuse
to
help
me
he
said
now
firmly
these
embassies
will
at
least
gain
us
time
and
you
are
not
surely
so
infatuated
as
to
suppose
the
prince
of
orange
can
withstand
the
progress
of
the
french
the
dismayed
secretary
had
no
answer
ready
john
de
witt
saw
his
advantage
and
pushed
it
further
the
alliances
with
spain
with
brandenburg
might
save
us
yet
had
we
time
to
conclude
them
fagel
interrupted
you
can
not
imagine
that
louis
would
listen
to
any
reasonable
treaty
he
fights
for
glory
m
de
louvois
is
with
him
might
deem
it
prudent
not
to
push
us
to
it
would
be
a
humiliation
not
so
bitter
a
humiliation
as
to
see
condé
march
through
the
hague
flashed
de
witt
i
can
not
believe
it
could
come
to
could
you
have
believed
a
month
ago
that
in
nine
days
every
fort
on
the
rhine
would
fall
there
is
de
ruyter
said
the
secretary
clutching
at
straws
he
can
not
save
the
land
gaspard
fagel
was
obstinate
there
is
the
m
fagel
the
prince
is
opposed
to
condé
turenne
luxumbourg
and
an
immense
army
strong
with
success
as
he
spoke
fagel
s
terrified
servant
entered
mynheer
he
addressed
the
grand
pensionary
a
gentleman
has
just
ridden
up
from
the
binnenhof
there
are
news
he
says
from
the
army
de
witt
interrupted
may
he
come
up
in
god
s
name
yes
cried
fagel
the
gentleman
proved
to
be
van
den
bosch
he
explained
his
visit
with
the
national
calm
a
soldier
had
arrived
at
the
binnenhof
with
letters
from
the
army
among
them
one
from
his
highness
for
de
witt
and
as
he
still
working
there
knew
of
his
master
s
intention
to
visit
fagel
he
had
brought
the
letter
on
at
once
there
was
also
a
note
from
beverningh
he
apologised
for
his
intrusion
bowed
and
withdrew
from
the
prince
cried
fagel
mopping
his
brow
john
de
witt
paled
as
he
gazed
at
the
large
familiar
handwriting
a
sickly
hue
of
dawn
was
mingled
with
the
glow
of
the
candles
and
in
the
cross
lights
the
figure
of
the
grand
pensionary
showed
tall
and
sombre
in
his
black
velvet
mantle
his
worn
face
near
as
colourless
as
his
crumpled
white
collar
gaspard
fagel
went
to
the
handsome
oak
buffet
and
pouring
wine
into
a
tall
green
glass
drank
fiercely
de
witt
stepped
nearer
to
the
candles
and
broke
open
the
seals
of
the
prince
s
letter
there
were
only
a
few
lines
the
grand
pensionary
read
them
and
handed
them
in
silence
to
the
secretary
given
at
my
camp
on
the
yssel
sir
i
am
in
great
distress
learning
the
approach
of
the
enemy
and
having
only
insufficient
forces
to
oppose
to
him
my
authority
is
restricted
and
my
movements
hampered
by
the
delegates
who
forbid
me
to
risk
a
battle
the
militia
and
the
peasants
are
in
a
state
of
terror
at
the
advance
of
the
french
the
division
available
for
the
defence
of
the
yssel
is
only
men
so
i
must
beg
you
to
order
without
an
hour
s
delay
that
as
many
soldiers
as
possible
be
sent
from
maestricht
breda
and
the
other
strong
places
in
flanders
i
think
also
that
the
few
horse
and
foot
which
are
still
in
holland
should
be
sent
here
otherwise
i
see
no
prospect
of
preventing
the
enemy
crossing
the
yssel
i
entreat
you
to
hold
out
a
helping
hand
to
one
who
is
and
ever
will
be
your
affectionate
friend
william
henry
prince
of
fagel
laid
the
letter
down
in
silence
he
too
was
pale
god
help
us
all
he
muttered
the
grand
pensionary
tore
open
beverningh
s
letter
he
read
it
at
once
aloud
you
will
have
heard
of
the
disastrous
passage
of
the
rhine
here
the
situation
is
desperate
i
hope
we
have
enough
gunpowder
but
the
artillery
is
dismounted
and
almost
useless
in
a
fortnight
s
time
we
shall
have
barely
seven
the
prince
has
displayed
activity
in
fortifying
the
river
and
disposing
his
men
to
the
best
advantage
the
fatigue
the
hardships
of
the
camp
and
his
anxieties
have
had
an
ill
effect
on
his
health
i
even
fear
for
his
life
though
he
says
no
word
of
discouragement
if
reinforcements
are
not
quickly
sent
he
must
be
driven
to
some
extremity
even
to
the
abandonment
of
the
yssel
no
general
could
have
done
more
than
his
highness
whom
i
regard
every
day
with
more
affection
but
you
must
see
that
with
such
an
inadequate
force
there
is
nothing
for
us
but
a
retreat
since
to
await
the
enemy
here
would
be
to
deliver
the
republic
to
her
enemies
by
exposing
her
sole
defenders
to
certain
destruction
his
highness
vehemently
opposed
the
abandonment
of
the
yssel
but
being
unsupported
by
any
save
count
hornes
in
his
desire
for
an
attack
on
the
french
and
hearing
of
the
almost
incredible
fall
of
the
rhine
fortresses
he
has
been
brought
to
see
that
it
would
be
wiser
to
fall
back
on
utrecht
we
lost
men
in
outposts
on
the
rhine
at
least
would
be
necessary
to
hold
the
yssel
and
we
have
and
those
disposed
in
echelons
which
can
not
easily
communicate
with
each
other
i
try
to
keep
up
the
spirits
of
those
about
me
i
pray
you
send
me
what
good
news
you
can
that
we
may
not
be
reduced
to
john
de
witt
raised
his
prominent
brown
eyes
and
fixed
them
with
a
steady
and
penetrating
gaze
on
fagel
what
do
you
say
now
the
secretary
bit
his
pale
lip
what
can
i
say
he
had
nothing
to
oppose
to
the
grand
pensionary
s
firm
resolution
he
was
alarmed
and
unnerved
john
de
witt
absolutely
master
of
himself
spoke
again
if
we
are
to
have
a
country
mynheer
the
progress
of
the
french
must
be
fagel
tried
to
rally
well
can
not
we
send
more
levies
to
his
highness
not
i
fear
in
time
from
beverningh
s
letter
i
think
they
will
abandon
the
line
of
the
fagel
poured
himself
out
another
glass
of
chablis
and
invited
de
witt
to
join
him
the
grand
pensionary
took
the
glass
mechanically
and
set
it
down
untasted
can
not
we
consult
the
prince
asked
fagel
who
was
afraid
of
offending
william
and
wished
to
shift
the
responsibility
john
de
witt
saw
his
motive
this
is
not
a
matter
for
the
captain
general
but
for
the
states
he
answered
with
a
stern
dignity
his
highness
hath
enough
to
save
by
betraying
himself
as
a
servile
and
unpatriotic
courtier
of
the
prince
fagel
could
resist
no
more
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
since
affairs
have
come
to
this
extremity
i
can
not
refuse
to
help
you
you
will
see
that
his
highness
party
offer
no
opposition
in
the
assembly
yes
fagel
was
still
thinking
of
what
the
prince
would
say
whom
do
you
propose
to
send
he
asked
abruptly
john
de
witt
was
prepared
at
all
points
m
de
groot
and
van
ghent
he
answered
at
once
they
are
both
obnoxious
to
his
highness
protested
fagel
they
are
acceptable
to
the
king
of
france
and
de
groot
having
been
so
long
in
paris
hath
a
greater
knowledge
of
french
affairs
than
any
man
i
the
secretary
was
in
some
agitation
mynheer
he
said
the
prince
hath
always
disliked
de
groot
john
de
witt
interrupted
for
no
more
worthy
reason
than
that
he
is
a
friend
of
mine
and
a
staunch
fagel
answered
with
some
dignity
i
do
not
know
his
highness
reasons
but
he
has
no
love
for
de
groot
and
as
for
van
ghent
m
van
ghent
had
the
misfortune
to
be
his
highness
tutor
he
is
however
a
man
whom
i
entirely
fagel
was
silenced
but
by
no
means
reassured
william
would
certainly
never
forgive
peace
proposals
being
sent
to
louis
without
his
wish
and
carried
moreover
by
the
two
men
whom
he
most
distrusted
and
disliked
de
witt
saw
the
secretary
s
hesitation
and
fearing
to
lose
his
support
made
a
concession
i
will
send
with
these
van
odyk
and
van
eyck
they
are
both
i
think
in
his
highness
fagel
caught
at
this
solution
of
the
difficulty
on
that
understanding
mynheer
i
will
second
you
with
all
my
power
in
the
assembly
you
are
going
there
at
once
in
a
while
i
have
to
write
to
the
prince
and
he
picked
up
his
hat
and
turned
to
take
his
leave
gaspard
fagel
could
not
fail
to
admire
the
patient
energy
the
proud
calm
the
unshaken
patriotism
of
the
man
who
was
working
in
the
face
of
such
odds
in
the
face
of
an
invasion
of
overwhelming
strength
domestic
dissension
calumny
abuse
and
dislike
from
the
people
he
was
labouring
for
with
all
his
noble
faculties
something
generous
in
the
secretary
s
commonplace
mind
was
touched
you
are
an
example
to
all
of
us
he
said
and
held
out
his
hand
john
de
witt
responded
instantly
mynheer
fagel
i
do
my
duty
and
there
are
many
thank
god
who
do
the
they
clasped
hands
warmly
i
shall
see
you
in
the
assembly
yes
answered
fagel
and
i
will
make
sure
mynheer
that
you
are
not
john
de
witt
took
up
his
letters
he
had
obtained
what
he
came
for
his
force
and
sincerity
aided
by
the
letters
from
the
camp
had
turned
an
opponent
into
an
ally
fagel
accompanied
him
to
the
door
then
returning
to
the
opened
the
shutters
on
the
grey
and
stormy
dawn
the
assembly
met
at
seven
he
glanced
at
the
clock
and
walked
up
and
down
with
hasty
steps
biting
his
forefinger
he
knew
that
nothing
would
reconcile
william
to
the
offers
of
peace
and
he
knew
that
he
would
be
blamed
for
ever
consenting
to
aid
john
de
witt
even
passively
he
himself
would
have
liked
to
throw
defiance
at
the
french
but
the
grand
pensionary
had
overruled
the
french
over
the
he
trembled
for
his
all
the
same
he
must
justify
himself
to
the
prince
whose
party
he
represented
he
must
write
to
the
camp
he
paused
thoughtfully
by
the
table
and
stared
absently
at
john
de
witt
s
untouched
glass
he
was
recalling
bentinck
s
secretary
van
mander
ardent
in
the
orange
cause
now
spending
his
time
in
idleness
in
the
deserted
palace
it
occurred
to
him
that
here
was
the
young
man
to
send
to
the
camp
with
a
letter
and
explanations
he
blew
out
the
candles
and
went
upstairs
to
finish
dressing
the
french
over
the
rhine
he
kept
saying
to
himself
and
what
of
de
ruyter
chapter
viii
solebay
the
night
was
fine
but
cold
the
stars
had
a
hard
brilliance
and
flashed
like
facets
of
steel
in
the
cloudless
sky
a
man
was
thoughtfully
pacing
the
deck
of
a
great
ship
now
and
again
he
looked
shrewdly
up
at
these
stars
a
strong
but
moderate
wind
was
filling
the
sails
and
the
ship
was
steering
rapidly
through
the
darkness
towards
the
east
coast
of
england
there
was
a
pleasant
whistling
in
the
cordage
and
a
pleasant
steady
swish
of
the
water
to
right
and
left
as
the
bows
cut
through
the
darkened
sea
when
the
man
turned
his
back
to
them
he
could
see
great
lights
dotted
irregularly
over
the
black
surface
of
the
ocean
these
were
the
lanterns
hanging
at
the
masts
of
the
fleet
silently
and
closely
following
its
leader
when
he
turned
again
and
came
under
the
sparse
rays
of
one
of
his
own
lamps
that
was
fastened
a
man
s
height
on
the
mast
he
was
shown
to
be
a
stout
short
gentleman
with
a
ruddy
face
and
thick
brown
hair
very
splendidly
dressed
in
scarlet
velvet
trimmed
with
gold
braid
and
wearing
a
heavy
sword
in
his
fringed
baldric
and
a
handsome
pistol
in
his
belt
his
wide
boots
were
turned
over
with
crimson
leather
flaps
and
on
his
right
shoulder
was
a
bunch
of
black
ribbons
he
carried
his
red
plumed
hat
under
his
arm
and
walked
with
a
slightly
swaggering
gait
pausing
for
a
moment
under
the
lantern
he
drew
out
his
watch
two
o
clock
as
he
was
passing
on
again
a
sailor
came
noiselessly
across
the
deck
mynheer
the
admiral
mynheer
cornelius
de
witt
would
like
to
speak
to
very
well
said
de
ruyter
with
a
little
nod
very
the
man
disappeared
into
the
darkness
of
the
ship
michael
de
ruyter
looked
again
at
the
stars
at
the
lights
of
his
ships
and
then
went
below
humming
a
song
in
a
hoarse
guttural
voice
he
found
cornelius
de
witt
alone
in
his
cabin
seated
before
a
table
scattered
with
papers
a
silver
hung
by
a
chain
from
the
ceiling
and
showed
the
plain
furnishings
which
served
as
a
background
to
the
splendid
figure
of
the
ruard
his
strong
and
handsome
features
were
stern
and
frowning
the
full
and
prominent
chin
that
gave
his
face
its
great
likeness
to
his
brother
s
more
delicate
countenance
were
set
grimly
in
his
effort
to
control
the
pain
of
the
rheumatism
that
tortured
him
dressed
with
the
magnificence
that
befitted
the
dignity
of
the
states
whose
sole
representative
he
was
with
the
fleet
he
wore
a
grey
velvet
suit
embroidered
in
silver
and
a
cravat
of
mechlin
lace
tied
with
a
ribbon
on
the
wall
beside
him
hung
his
sword
that
swung
with
the
swaying
of
the
ship
on
a
chest
beneath
were
a
couple
of
richly
mounted
pistols
and
a
few
books
and
maps
admiral
de
ruyter
paused
inside
the
door
standing
with
his
feet
far
apart
after
the
fashion
of
a
man
accustomed
to
pitching
seas
ah
said
the
ruard
looking
up
is
the
wind
still
favourable
it
is
answered
michael
de
ruyter
and
unless
it
falls
we
shall
make
the
coast
of
england
before
you
do
not
think
they
will
escape
this
time
by
god
s
help
the
admiral
seated
himself
on
the
chest
inside
the
door
and
looked
down
at
the
great
crimson
rosettes
on
his
boots
the
lamp
threw
his
shadow
behind
him
bringing
into
relief
his
seamed
and
face
that
was
rendered
attractive
by
the
composed
lofty
expression
and
the
bright
intelligent
black
eyes
i
think
we
shall
meet
them
at
last
he
added
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
a
week
ago
cornelius
de
witt
had
obtained
the
consent
of
the
states
general
to
his
earnest
desire
for
an
engagement
and
since
then
the
dutch
fleet
had
been
cruising
in
search
of
the
combined
fleets
of
france
and
england
whose
junction
at
portsmouth
they
had
been
unable
to
prevent
a
bold
had
brought
them
news
that
the
enemy
was
at
anchor
on
the
east
coast
between
harwich
and
yarmouth
and
silently
through
the
june
night
the
ships
of
the
united
provinces
crowding
all
canvas
bore
forward
to
battle
cornelius
de
witt
put
up
his
letters
one
to
his
brother
and
one
to
his
wife
i
hope
to
add
good
news
to
them
he
said
smiling
at
de
ruyter
the
admiral
pulled
at
his
moustache
i
have
to
ask
your
permission
before
i
attack
you
know
mynheer
he
said
affectionately
you
have
the
authority
and
the
you
know
my
opinion
was
the
answer
nothing
but
an
engagement
can
save
us
i
would
we
were
at
work
on
it
now
john
agrees
with
i
would
like
to
know
how
things
go
on
land
said
de
ruyter
a
shade
passed
over
the
face
of
cornelius
de
witt
almost
i
fear
to
know
with
everything
trusted
to
that
michael
de
ruyter
nodded
sombrely
at
his
years
are
the
least
i
have
against
you
do
not
trust
him
nor
a
stern
silence
fell
the
ruard
was
the
first
to
speak
we
have
our
own
affairs
to
think
of
very
much
lies
with
the
swinging
sword
made
a
soft
sound
against
the
smooth
wall
and
the
lamp
swayed
on
its
chain
as
the
great
vessel
pitched
i
mean
to
try
a
surprise
said
michael
de
ruyter
that
is
what
i
wanted
to
see
you
about
you
think
we
can
if
the
wind
does
not
forsake
they
will
be
tis
ay
they
can
scarce
be
expecting
an
the
ruard
s
brown
eyes
flashed
is
king
charles
birthday
answered
the
admiral
the
english
at
least
will
be
engaged
in
celebrating
it
we
have
every
cornelius
de
witt
clasped
his
hands
on
the
table
before
him
if
one
life
could
secure
the
victory
michael
de
ruyter
looked
up
i
should
be
very
glad
to
die
could
i
see
the
english
sails
scatter
as
i
saw
them
once
scatter
before
us
at
chatham
and
i
think
i
shall
god
have
mercy
on
me
if
i
we
must
have
victory
said
cornelius
de
witt
passionately
there
is
no
if
de
ruyter
we
must
have
victory
it
is
quite
certain
said
de
ruyter
simply
that
if
we
do
not
make
a
descent
on
england
they
will
make
a
descent
on
the
coast
of
he
put
his
hands
squarely
on
his
knees
and
fixed
his
bright
eyes
on
the
representative
of
the
states
how
many
sail
do
you
make
them
asked
the
ruard
michael
de
ruyter
checked
them
off
on
his
stout
fingers
the
english
ships
of
war
sixteen
three
or
four
thousand
guns
and
or
so
thousand
men
the
french
not
more
than
sail
all
included
not
more
than
ten
thousand
men
that
is
the
uttermost
they
can
be
if
their
entire
force
has
cornelius
de
witt
was
silent
the
fleet
of
the
united
provinces
was
a
hundred
and
sail
including
the
galiots
they
did
not
carry
quite
five
thousand
guns
the
men
including
five
thousand
marines
did
not
exceed
thousand
the
ruard
cast
up
these
odds
the
admiral
seemed
to
detect
some
anxiety
in
his
thoughtful
face
we
are
in
god
s
hands
mynheer
de
witt
and
i
can
not
think
it
is
his
will
to
forsake
us
cornelius
de
witt
made
a
movement
as
if
to
get
on
his
feet
but
he
could
not
rise
for
his
crippled
limbs
and
the
momentary
effort
brought
the
drops
of
anguish
to
his
forehead
you
battle
with
a
sharper
foe
than
the
english
said
admiral
de
ruyter
with
a
little
frown
of
sympathy
madame
de
witt
would
say
you
should
be
in
the
ruard
leant
forward
supporting
himself
on
the
table
i
am
not
so
ill
he
answered
forcing
a
smile
to
his
pale
lips
that
i
can
not
go
on
deck
nay
you
can
not
well
i
can
be
carried
a
deputy
can
take
your
orders
the
representative
of
the
states
general
can
not
remain
in
his
cabin
when
the
fleet
is
in
action
replied
cornelius
de
witt
proudly
i
will
go
on
deck
at
michael
de
ruyter
said
no
more
each
in
silence
and
after
his
own
fashion
had
dedicated
his
life
to
his
country
the
light
of
the
swinging
lamp
shone
in
the
bravery
of
velvets
gold
buttons
and
braid
the
trappings
of
swords
and
pistols
and
on
the
calm
resolute
faces
of
the
two
men
who
were
being
borne
swiftly
on
to
battle
de
ruyter
rose
and
opened
the
porthole
the
expanse
of
water
almost
on
a
level
with
his
eye
was
beginning
to
glimmer
with
a
greyish
tinge
as
the
ship
dipped
to
her
side
the
heavy
spray
splashed
in
on
to
the
cabin
floor
de
ruyter
shut
it
out
the
dawn
he
said
he
shook
hands
with
cornelius
they
looked
into
each
other
s
eyes
and
without
a
word
from
either
de
ruyter
went
up
on
the
deck
the
sea
was
changing
to
a
silver
colour
beneath
the
clear
sky
of
a
june
dawn
the
stars
were
faintly
sparkling
through
a
veil
of
fast
rising
mist
the
colour
of
lilac
flowers
that
lay
over
the
horizon
before
the
flagship
lay
the
stretch
of
rippling
waters
and
the
indefinite
distant
line
of
land
behind
her
and
to
right
and
left
was
the
fleet
of
the
united
provinces
crowding
all
sail
under
a
pressure
of
wind
and
blocking
the
sky
with
the
straining
canvas
the
dark
masts
and
the
flags
bearing
the
lions
of
the
republic
at
many
of
the
bulkheads
the
lamps
still
burnt
with
a
pale
and
useless
glare
but
as
the
day
strengthened
these
were
extinguished
silently
like
the
last
stars
in
the
brightening
heavens
seven
continued
to
lead
at
four
o
clock
she
sighted
the
enemy
lying
at
anchor
off
the
coast
of
england
by
the
maps
it
appeared
that
they
were
nearing
solebay
midway
between
yarmouth
and
harwich
de
ruyter
sent
off
boats
to
summon
the
principal
officers
of
the
fleet
on
board
his
ship
and
went
himself
to
tell
cornelius
de
witt
that
the
enemy
was
in
view
thereupon
the
ruard
was
carried
on
deck
in
a
chair
bearing
the
arms
of
the
republic
and
placed
by
the
mast
in
the
position
of
honour
and
danger
out
of
the
hundred
men
appointed
by
the
states
general
to
attend
him
twelve
halberdiers
were
selected
now
to
form
a
guard
armed
on
back
and
breast
they
took
their
places
about
his
chair
and
the
early
sun
glittered
in
their
steel
appointments
the
ruard
was
bareheaded
his
bandaged
legs
rested
on
a
velvet
footstool
his
sword
lay
across
his
knee
and
his
pistols
were
in
his
belt
in
his
right
hand
he
held
a
bible
with
gold
clasps
the
strong
fresh
wind
blew
his
hair
across
his
brow
and
fluttered
the
scarlet
ribbon
that
fastened
his
cravat
shielding
his
eyes
with
his
hand
from
the
glare
of
sun
and
water
he
fixed
his
narrowed
gaze
on
the
barely
visible
line
of
the
enemy
de
ruyter
was
pacing
to
and
fro
with
his
straddling
gait
his
hands
clasped
behind
him
and
his
keen
eyes
following
the
movements
of
the
sailors
who
were
clearing
the
decks
at
five
o
clock
when
the
water
under
the
slackening
wind
had
subsided
to
faint
ripples
that
the
sun
freed
from
the
obscuring
mist
gilded
with
dazzling
light
the
captains
and
principal
officers
of
the
fleet
came
aboard
seven
among
them
were
many
noble
volunteers
of
the
finest
families
of
the
kingdom
who
had
placed
their
services
and
their
fortunes
at
the
disposal
of
the
country
michael
de
ruyter
the
son
of
the
zeeland
brewer
s
man
received
them
with
simple
courtesy
they
shook
hands
with
him
and
then
with
the
ruard
near
whose
chair
he
stood
every
detail
of
the
beautiful
ship
and
of
the
magnificently
dressed
men
who
stood
gathered
about
her
mast
shining
gold
and
silver
velvets
satin
and
pistols
eager
faces
and
bare
yellow
or
brown
heads
for
they
were
all
uncovered
out
of
respect
to
mynheer
cornelius
de
witt
was
sparkling
visibly
in
the
gay
sunshine
admiral
de
ruyter
set
his
feet
far
apart
and
again
clasped
his
gauntleted
hands
behind
him
gentlemen
of
my
fleet
he
said
and
his
quick
eyes
roved
along
the
line
of
faces
we
are
in
the
presence
of
the
enemy
it
is
my
intention
to
give
battle
i
feel
that
your
courage
and
your
devotion
are
equal
to
the
difficulty
and
importance
of
your
task
we
have
to
face
greater
numbers
but
on
our
side
is
justice
and
with
god
s
help
we
shall
not
fail
the
safety
of
the
country
the
liberty
of
the
united
provinces
the
fortunes
and
the
lives
of
their
inhabitants
depend
upon
this
battle
and
only
your
valour
can
secure
the
republic
against
the
unjust
violence
of
the
two
kings
who
attack
his
pointed
moustache
seemed
to
bristle
and
there
was
a
fierce
gleam
in
his
narrowed
eyes
well
he
added
with
a
little
nod
get
to
your
work
and
ask
the
lord
god
in
his
mercy
to
help
us
if
such
be
his
cornelius
de
witt
lifted
his
noble
face
what
can
i
add
your
own
good
courage
will
direct
you
god
have
you
in
his
keeping
they
bent
their
heads
captain
engel
de
ruyter
spoke
if
the
enemy
were
twice
as
strong
we
should
have
faith
mynheer
in
the
justice
of
our
cause
since
we
fight
for
liberty
and
they
for
the
ruard
and
the
admiral
shook
hands
with
them
all
a
second
time
and
they
returned
to
their
ships
silent
and
seemingly
unmoved
as
was
the
habit
of
their
nation
with
all
speed
possible
the
fleet
of
the
united
provinces
was
beating
to
windwards
but
the
strong
breeze
had
dropped
and
de
ruyter
no
longer
hoped
for
a
surprise
the
enemy
had
already
seen
them
and
were
hastily
arranging
themselves
for
battle
so
utterly
unprepared
were
they
that
in
the
confusion
many
of
the
english
ships
had
to
cut
their
cables
to
place
themselves
in
line
de
ruyter
on
the
forecastle
saw
this
and
his
lips
stiffened
the
superiority
of
the
enemy
sent
a
thrill
of
pleasurable
excitement
through
his
veins
he
was
a
just
and
honourable
man
well
fitted
to
serve
under
john
de
witt
and
all
his
indomitable
energies
were
roused
by
the
wanton
aggression
of
the
king
of
england
had
he
not
commenced
attack
like
a
pirate
by
attempting
to
capture
the
india
fleet
before
war
was
declared
and
in
violation
of
the
treaty
between
england
and
the
united
provinces
by
seizing
all
the
dutch
in
english
ports
john
de
witt
had
disdained
to
revenge
himself
for
this
perfidy
as
he
had
disdained
to
answer
charles
frivolous
pretexts
for
war
and
every
english
vessel
had
gone
free
according
to
the
agreement
the
united
provinces
were
too
proud
to
break
it
was
an
example
of
the
different
spirit
animating
the
two
governments
the
dutch
were
upheld
by
every
noble
feeling
patriotism
may
call
forth
they
fought
for
the
finest
of
motives
for
the
most
glorious
of
ends
the
english
ashamed
of
their
leaders
hating
the
alliance
with
the
french
whose
cats
they
suspected
themselves
to
be
sullen
at
the
unworthy
part
they
felt
themselves
to
be
filling
had
no
motive
to
acquit
themselves
well
save
mere
desire
for
reprisals
on
a
country
that
had
already
once
beaten
them
off
the
sea
michael
de
ruyter
was
alive
to
this
difference
of
spirit
in
the
two
forces
about
to
meet
calling
his
men
on
to
the
he
pressed
their
advantage
warmly
exhorting
every
one
to
do
his
best
in
a
noble
cause
and
assuring
them
out
of
the
depth
of
his
own
strong
simple
faith
of
god
s
help
in
their
utmost
endeavours
the
men
devoted
to
their
admiral
and
the
finest
seamen
in
the
world
responded
with
a
cheerful
enthusiasm
that
was
the
outward
expression
of
undaunted
purpose
and
courage
each
went
to
his
place
the
swivel
guns
on
the
top
of
the
forecastle
and
bulwarks
were
swung
to
front
the
enemy
the
eager
gunners
knelt
before
the
long
guns
on
the
main
and
and
below
the
smooth
muzzles
pointed
from
the
portholes
the
standard
of
the
republic
floated
stiffly
out
from
the
mainmast
of
seven
vivid
in
the
sunshine
cornelius
de
witt
raised
his
eyes
to
it
and
murmured
a
prayer
the
hammocks
were
lashed
to
the
nettings
and
behind
them
the
marines
with
their
muskets
in
their
hands
took
up
their
position
by
now
the
wanton
english
breeze
had
changed
again
and
a
high
sea
was
running
de
ruyter
gave
the
order
to
reef
in
topsails
they
were
almost
within
range
of
the
allied
fleet
who
had
now
drawn
themselves
up
into
line
of

divided
into
three
squadrons

michael

walked
up
to
his

it
was
then
nearly
eight
o
clock
of
a
beautiful
june
day
not
a
cloud
visible
and
the
deep
green
water
curling
into
foam
about
the
bows
of
the
advancing
vessels
above

flew
circling
the
sunlight
on

to

said
in

he
said
calmly
you

have
and
he
steered
seven
straight
for
the
duke
of

flagship
there
was
a
moment
s
pause
of
heightened
calm
it
seemed
during
which
was
no
sound
save
the
harsh
scream
of
a
seagull
and
the
splash
of
the
waves
curling
over
one
another
then
the
guns
leapt
into
a
roar
a
furious
broadside
came
from
the
of
seven
the
shots
tore
the
water
into
foam
and
buried
themselves
in
the
side
of
royal
who
returned
an
instant
cannonade
a
thick
smoke
a
heavy
dun
in
colour
at
once
wrapped
both
vessels
to
the
right
rang
a
second
roar
as
van
ghent
engaged
lord
sandwich
and
to
the
left
the
answering
boom
of
the
french
cannon
the
two
flagships
were
now
and
the
dutch
opened
a
hot
fire
of
musketry
from
behind
their
hammocks
theirs
being
the
higher
vessel
they
were
able
to
inflict
on
the
english
a
galling
volley
of
small
shot
that
raked
their
exposed
decks
aware
of
this
disadvantage
royal
tried
to
get
out
of
her
opponent
s
reach
but
the
light
wind
would
not
serve
her
and
de
ruyter
brought
about
a
collision
driving
the
port
bow
of
seven
into
the
enemy
s
starboard
side
the
english
marines
on
the
poop
commenced
a
steady
fire
of
musketry
but
the
dutch
tore
a
hole
in
their
enemy
s
side
and
the
deck
guns
crippled
her
masts
the
smoke
was
already
so
thick
that
the
sky
was
entirely
obscured
the
stifling
vapour
was
rent
across
by
the
flashes
of
fire
from
the
guns
and
the
fresh
spurts
of
white
smoke
that
followed
each
shot
the
roar
of
the
great
cannon
below
was
incessant
splinters
flew
from
each
ship
and
the
planks
of
the
dutch
vessel
became
so
heated
with
her
own
cannonade
that
seamen
had
to
stand
ready
with
buckets
of
water
to
extinguish
the
flames
as
the
enemy
was
so
close
in
their
embrace
the
dutch
from
the
nettings
kept
up
a
continuous
fire
that
picked
off
numbers
of
the
english
crew
while
the
swivel
guns
on
the
forecastle
heavily
raked
the
enemy
s
masts
and
rigging
michael
de
ruyter
walking
up
and
down
the
upper
deck
giving
his
orders
stopped
beside
the
chair
of
cornelius
de
witt
the
air
was
foul
with
the
smell
of
powder
and
they
could
hardly
hear
each
other
for
the
thunder
of
the
guns
how
long
will
she
hold
out
admiral
asked
the
ruard
i
think
she
will
be
badly
beaten
in
a
very
little
while
answered
de
ruyter
with
his
thumbs
in
his
embroidered
sash
the
musketry
fire
was
playing
round
cornelius
de
witt
but
he
did
not
even
seem
to
notice
it
a
ball
had
buried
itself
in
the
deck
a
few
inches
from
the
stool
where
his
bandaged
feet
rested
two
of
his
guards
had
already
fallen
been
carried
to
the
rails
by
the
silent
survivors
and
flung
overboard
blood
began
to
appear
everywhere
on
the
smooth
planks
on
the
gay
clothes
of
the
officers
on
the
naked
glistening
bodies
of
the
gunners
several
of
the
marines
lay
heavily
over
useless
muskets
in
the
nettings
their
bodies
jerking
helplessly
with
the
swaying
of
the
ship
on
the
lower
deck
others
remained
where
they
had
fallen
mostly
on
their
faces
with
the
red
stain
spreading
underneath
them
a
gentle
breeze
rose
and
drove
off
royal
after
nearly
an
hour
of
furious
firing
the
english
ship
had
suffered
severely
her
spars
had
gone
her
sides
were
driven
in
her
foremast
and
had
been
shot
away
and
many
of
her
guns
were
dismounted
de
ruyter
had
lost
only
his
and
one
of
the
lower
yards
and
of
his
crew
comparatively
few
but
the
dead
could
be
seen
piled
high
on
the
english
ship
encouraged
by
the
sight
of
the
enemy
the
dutch
turned
on
her
another
fierce
cannonade
that
swept
off
her
and
battered
her
hulls
this
time
the
english
guns
did
not
answer
and
a
low
murmur
of
triumph
went
up
from
seven
her
cannon
impeded
by
her
own
falling
spars
half
the
gunners
down
dead
and
dying
entangled
in
the
rigging
that
lay
along
the
deck
royal
was
utterly
unmanageable
her
pilot
could
do
nothing
with
her
she
lay
helpless
a
tattered
shape
looming
through
the
heavy
smoke
her
mainmast
still
stood
and
there
the
red
standard
of
england
riddled
with
shot
floated
above
the
battle
it
was
now
nine
o
clock
de
ruyter
gave
orders
for
another
broadside
it
was
replied
to
by
a
feeble
volley
from
the
english
ship
now
pitching
uselessly
the
mainmast
swayed
then
crashed
down
dragging
the
cordage
and
remaining
canvas
with
it
smoke
began
to
belch
through
her
portholes
and
to
complete
her
distress
one
of
the
blew
up
killing
several
of
the
crew
and
firing
the
side
she
is
finished
said
de
ruyter
standing
behind
his
pilot
and
as
the
royal
standard
fell
the
hoarse
shouts
of
victory
rose
from
the
decks
of
seven
royal
tried
now
to
withdraw
but
was
prevented
by
the
other
vessels
of
de
ruyter
s
squadron
they
closed
round
her
and
sent
out
to
complete
her
destruction
the
sea
was
scattered
with
wreckage
and
stained
with
trails
of
blood
and
flecks
of
foam
the
curtain
of
smoke
concealed
the
rest
of
the
battle
but
the
continuous
sound
of
the
guns
and
the
splashes
of
flame
in
the
darkness
testified
to
its
fierceness
michael
de
ruyter
on
the
forecastle
saw
a
boat
put
out
from
royal
and
struggle
through
the
dipping
bullets
that
lashed
the
water
into
spray
it
at
one
of
the
portholes
and
a
man
in
a
blue
coat
stepped
out
and
took
his
place
in
the
stern
sheet
he
carried
the
standard
that
had
just
been
disentangled
from
the
bloody
deck
it
is
the
duke
of

said
admiral
de
ruyter
narrowing
his
keen
eyes
steer
away
from
royal
zegen
for
they
have
abandoned
the
flagship
the
little
dutch
galiots
ran
out
crowding
all
canvas
and
trying
to
reach
the
in
which
the
lord
high
admiral
of
england
was
conveying
his
flag
across
the
firing
line
they
could
see
the
english
sailors
straining
at
the
oars
and
the
prince
himself
ducking
under
the
bullets
one
of
which
flattened
itself
against
the
bows
of
his
boat
the
utter
calm
delayed
the
the
english
boat
escaped
into
the
smoke
and
about
nine
with
a
blare
of
trumpets
the
english
flag
was
rehoisted
aboard
saint
royal
on
fire
in
three
places
an
abandoned
and
drifting
wreck
collided
with
one
of
her
own
galiots
and
instant
flames
involved
them
both
in
a
common
doom
such
as
remained
of
her
crew
threw
themselves
into
the
sea
clinging
desperately
to
broken
spars
and
planks
while
the
pale
fire
leapt
hissing
to
the
height
of
her
fallen
mast
and
stained
the
sombre
smoke
with
sparks
and
flying
fragments
as
gun
after
gun
and
cask
after
cask
of
gunpowder
exploded
at
the
touch
of
the
flames
seven

off
from
the
floating
mischief
and
silencing
with
a
sweep
of
her
guns
the
circle
of
english
that
surrounded
her
went
for

an
officer
came
on
board
from
captain

de
ruyter

ship
to
say
that
the
captain
was
disabled
by
a
dangerous
wound

sinking
with
six
holes
in

side
being
beset

his
course
to

of

nothing
standing

patched

together
and
returning

seconded

in

attack
on

at

away
by

fierce
fusillade
from

into

and
the
two
ships
crashed
together
starboard

to
board

a
desperate
fight
between

ensued

to

the
while
keeping
up
a
murderous
cannonade
on
the
frigates
opposed
by
the
dutch
the
sharp
short
rattle
of
musketry
was
heard
above
the
steady
roar
of
the
great
guns
and
little
threads
of
flame
and
puffs
of
white
smoke
sprang
out
and
vanished
against
the
curtain
of
yellow
fog
as
the
marines
on
board
seven
under
cover
of
the
nets
picked
off
the
sailors
in
the
rigging
of
saint
two
other
high
dutch
vessels
looming
up
out
of
the
noise
and
darkness
of

silenced
the
starboard
guns
of
the
english
flagship
with
a
volley
her
poop
was
swept
bare
with
a
cannonade
from
de

her

swayed
through
the
smoke
that
belched
on
her
from
all
sides
for
the
second
time
the
english
standard
fell
de
ruyter
strove
to
press
his
advantage
and
sent
out
two

to
sink

her

brilliantly
managed
the

her
out
of

again
the

again
he
was
rowed
through

and
the
ragged

was
hoisted
on
de
ruyter
having
vanquished
those
ships
immediately
in

with

turned
his
attention
to
the
other
parts
of
the
battle
the
french
fleet
beaten
in
a
first
engagement
and
wishing
to
leave
the
brunt
of
the
battle
to
their
allies
had
withdrawn
towards
the
south
hotly
pursued
by
van
banckert
whose
distant
guns
could
be
heard
in
the
lulls
of
the
nearer
firing
van
ghent
had
begun
the
fight
on
the
left
wing
with
a
fury
that
had
brought
the
squadron
of
the
blue
to
retreat
in
confusion
and
terror
but
as
de
ruyter
was
fighting
his
way
through
a
circle
of
to
second
him
a
young
lieutenant
came
up
in
a
little
galiot
and
announced
to
cornelius
de

that
admiral
van

was
dead
in
the
midst
of

victorious
onset
he
had
been

well
for

carried
away
one
arm
of
his
chair
three
more
of
his
guards
had
fallen
and
the
deck
was
smeared
with
blood
and
burnt
with
powder
to
his
very
feet
behind
him
leaning
against
the
mast
a
dying
boy
sat
staring
at
a
fingerless
hand
he
held
across
his
knees
the
sea
was
rising
and
the
ship
began
to
toss
pitching
the
dead
to
and
fro
on
the
slippery
decks
de
ruyter
stood
beside
the
ruard
s
chair
his
feet
far
apart
and
gave
directions
in
a
firm
voice
the
captain
advancing
for
instructions
had
his
arm
shattered
by
a
shot
that
splintered
the
mast
he
went
below
to
the
dark
cabin
where
the
surgeon
was
at
work
and
returned
to
take
his
orders
with
an
empty
sleeve
pinned
across
his
breast
opened
an
obstinate
fire
and
de
ruyter
answered
leaving
the
left
wing
to
manage
the
squadron
of
the
blue
they
not
receiving
the
expected
signal
from
van
ghent
s
ship
had
given
the
english
time
to
recover
from
the
first
shock
of
the
onslaught
the
earl
of
sandwich
on
board
royal
his
flagship
rallied
his
force
and
advanced
in
order
of
battle
it
was
now
past
midday
and
though
the
advantage
had
been
so
far
with
the
dutch
the
english
gave
no
signs
of
yielding
de
ruyter
signalled
to
sweers
to
take
over
the
command
of
the
left
division
and
make
a
decisive
attack
on
the
blue
but
there
was
one
dutchman
who
waited
for
no
signal
captain
van
brakel
of
city
of
the
hero
of
the
victory
of
chatham
ardently
desirous
further
to
distinguish
himself
he
conceived
the
boldly
audacious
scheme
of
capturing
or
destroying
royal
himself
defying
all
discipline
he
left
without
orders
de
ruyter
s
squadron
to
which
he
belonged
and
advanced
to
royal
across
the
black
pool
of
waters
the
battle
enclosed
the
exploit
was
daring
to
recklessness
for
the
english
ship
carried
guns
and
men
while
his
little
vessel
was
only
armed
with
guns
and
men
an
angry
broadside
from
the
great
ship
met
her
rash
foe
captain
van
brakel
approached
without
replying
royal
alarmed
at
this
manœuvre
spread
her
topsails
and
tried
to
sheer
off
but
van
brakel
was
too
quick
he
hauled
his
wind
drew
up
alongside
the
english
threw
out
his
grappling
irons
and
seized
her
while
his
guns
blew
away
her
cordage
and
rigging
despite
royal
james
desperate
efforts
the
two
ships
remained
locked
together
there
was
a
rush
of
dutch
to
the
sides
an
answering
charge
on
the
part
of
the
english
and
the
crews
mingled
in
a
fierce
fight
with
muskets
pistols
swords
and
even
sticks
and
fragments
of
iron
van
brakel
regardless
of
a
broken
and
a
cut
on
his
forehead
that
blinded
him
led
his
men
himself
the
sheer
genius
for
fighting
rose
in
the
english
let
their
cause
be
good
or
bad
they
could
not
have
fought
more
fiercely
the
earl
of
sandwich
with
a
broken
sword
in
his
hand
and
panting
a
little
by
reason
of
his
stoutness
ran
up
with
his
officers
don
t
let
the
damned
dutchmen
board
he
shouted
and
a
yell
of
fury
rose
to
answer
him
the
netherlanders
silent
but
equally
in
earnest
pressed
over
the
bodies
of
their
comrades
and
closed
with
the
english
on
the
deck
of
their
own
ship
clinging
to
the
rails
the
grappling
irons
even
to
the
guns
some
of
which
many
succeeded
in
ramming
under
the
very
eyes
of
the
gunners
meanwhile
their
own
cannon
kept
up
a
steady
fire
the
dutch
gunners
remaining
at
their
places
in
face
of
a
cruel
discharge
from
the
deck
guns
of
royal
man
after
man
fell
as
he

putting
the
match
to
the

and
lay
silently
gasping
his
life
out
but
there
was
never
lack
of
another

take
his
place
the
dwindling

moved
forward
as
the

occurred
and
city

were
never

suffering
severely
her
masts
were
tottering
her
sails
hanging
in
ribbons
all
lord

s
efforts
were
directed
to
a
frantic
attempt
to
disengage
her
but
still
the
little
dutch
vessel
clung
to
her
side
still
the
guns
poured
their
fire
into
her
with
unabated
vigour
at
one
after
the
duel
had
lasted
an
hour
and
a
half
the
english
masts
went
overboard
on
the
disengaged
side
dragging
the
admiral
s
flag
into
the
sea
the
guns
on
the
forecastle
and
were
put
out
of
action
by
the
fallen
canvas
the
going
over
the
portholes
and
becoming
involved
with
the
dutch
grappling
irons

done
enough
battered
half
her

dead
and
all
her
officers
wounded
she
changed
her
tactics
and
withdrew

her
chains
and
signalled

in

not
a

shot
away
her
decks
piled
with
dead
and
wreckage
many
of
her
guns
silenced
she
lay
a
huge
useless
hulk
but
the
earl
of
sandwich
was
still
aboard
her
and
from
her
bows
still
floated
the
english
flag
sweers
hastened
up
to
the
aid
of
the
heroic
van
brakel
under
the
cover
of
whose
guns
the
were
advancing
but
lord
sandwich
opened
a
last
desperate
cannonade
one
was
sunk
the
other
driven
back
on
city
of
van
brakel
wounded
three
times
but
with
his
rash
valour
utterly
unquenched
again
brought
his
disabled
ship
forward
urging
on
the
which
was
commanded
by
van

the
captain
who
had
burnt
at
chatham
lord

could
no
longer
save
himself
protected
by
the
dutch
guns
van
ryn
advanced
right
under
the
bows
of
royal
and
succeeded
in
firing
the
canvas
that
hung
over
her
portholes
retreating
uninjured
the
flames
seemed
to
crouch
and
hesitate
for
a
moment
then
leapt
fiercely
on
to
the
wreckage
of
rigging
and
cordage
city
of
steered
off
her
dangerous
foe
and
the
gallant
little
hastened
from
the
reach
of
the
ruin
she
had
caused
there
was
no
hope
for
royal
cries
of
angry
despair
rose
from
the
english
as
they
saw
themselves
abandoned
in
flaming
isolation
and
they
might
be
seen
rushing
to
the
boats
and
endeavouring
under
the
captain
s
orders
to
flood
the
powder
magazine
the
flames
twisted
over
the
feeding
greedily
on
the
broken
masts
the
tattered
canvas
and
the
oaken
planks
lord
sandwich
s
flagship
is
burning
as
the
news
spread
the
very
battle
seemed
hushed
to
watch
the
death
agony
of
the
great
vessel
van
brakel
lying
wounded
on
his
deck
gave
orders
for
the
firing
to
cease
and
bade
his
crew
save
such
of
the
english
as
they
could
but
their
boats
had
been
shot
to
splinters
they
could
do
nothing
sweers
sent
a
pinnace
to
the
rescue
but
it
made
slow
progress
through
the
clogged
and
swelling
sea
meanwhile
the
fire
was
encroaching
over
every
portion
of
royal
the
soldiers
and
sailors
began
to
hurl
themselves
into
the
sea
it
was
but
a
choice
of
deaths
most
were
instantly
drowned
in
the
waves
their
flaming
ship
stained
with
a
crimson
reflection
one
after
another
the
guns
exploded
with
a
blaze
of
white
flame
and
from
every
porthole
issued
dark
slow
smoke
from
the
wet
powder
the
dutch
threw
out
ropes
and
broken
spars
to
the
few
desperate
survivors
who
swam
towards
them
the
captain
bitterly
wounded
and
a
young
lieutenant
were
hauled
on
board
city
of
the
first
fainted
as
he
reached
the
enemy
s
deck
and
the
other
flinging
back
his
wet
hair
gazed
at
his
burning
ship
where
is
my
lord
he
asked
where
is
the
admiral
a
crowded
boat
put
out
from
royal
and
the
dutch
pinnace
tried
to
reach
it
but
numbers
of
drowning
wretches
striving
frantically
to
cling
to
its
sides
it
became
waterlogged
and
sank
under
the
rescuers
gaze
then
those
who
watched
with
straining
eyes
saw
the
of
england
in
his
courtier
s
dress
advance
out
of
the
smoke
and
mount
up
to
the
untouched
portion
of
the
ship
where
the
flag
still
floated
lord
montague
his
son
was
with
him
the
english
knew
him
by
his
gold
coat
and
scarlet
sash
he
had
his
useless
sword
in
his
hand
and
set
his
back
against
the
flagstaff
facing
the
advancing
flames
a
heavy
swell
troubled
the
sea
royal
swung
about
as
if
she
writhed
and
the
flames
swept
windward
blowing
over
the
battle
like
an
enormous
banner
of
a
vivid
transparent
whiteness
edged
with
leaping
tongues
of
crimson
that
licked
into
the
smoky
background
the
crew
of
city
of
could
see
the
earl
of
sandwich
calmly
placed
beside
his
flag
could
see
his
son
drop
his
sword
and
put
his
hand
over
his
eyes
the
fire
darted
on
with
a
sinister
roar
it
was
the
last
seen
of
my
lord
the
ship
was
burning
to
the
water
s
edge
the
hull
dipped
as
if
the
tortured
vessel
strove
to
quench
her
agony
in
the
bloodstained
waves
the
english
flag
fluttered
a
moment
then
disappeared
in
fire
the
powder
being
wet
there
was
no
explosion
she
burnt
slowly
pitilessly
to
ashes
till
at
length
the
flames
rose
sheer
from
the
sea
and
sank
reluctantly
to
nothingness
above
their
annihilated
prey
at
the
end
of
an
hour
the
waves
had
closed
over
the
fragments
of
royal
and
the
fire
hissed
sullenly
along
floating
planks
and
overturned
boats
i
would
i
could
have
saved
my
lord
admiral
said
captain
van
brakel
he
did
not
choose
to
be
saved
answered
the
lieutenant
fiercely
it
was
now
seven
o
clock
and
all
heart
had
left
the
english
the
terrific
end
of
the
earl
of
sandwich
had
utterly
daunted
the
squadron
of
the
blue
the
duke
of

alone
still
kept
up
an
obstinate
fight
and
aided
by
a
veering
wind
strove
to
drive
his
against

abandoned
by
the
daring
van
brakel
and
separated
from
his
second

command
van

having
no
vessels
with
him
but
a
yacht
and
a
frigate
was
for
a
while
hard
pressed
by
the
obstinate
fire
kept
up
by
and
the
advance
of
the
english
his
own
boats
having
been
sunk
he
had
nothing
with
which
to
ward
off
their
approach
michael
de
ruyter
saw
himself
in
an
ugly
situation
for
a
moment
it
seemed
as
if
he
was
doomed
to
the
same
fate
as
admiral
the
earl
of
sandwich
and
cornelius
de
witt
was
about
to
order
the
pumps
to
be
turned
on
the
powder
magazine
when
the
little
frigate
under
the
command
of
the
intrepid
captain
philip
d
almonde
resolved
to
sacrifice
herself
to
save
the
flagship
followed
closely
by
the
yacht
she
advanced
on
the
the
first
ran
into
her
bows
and
fired
her
but
the
heroic
efforts
of
captain
d
almonde
extinguished
the
flames
and
a
sharp
volley
from
his
guns
set
light
to
the
powder
the
enemy
carried
and
she
was
borne
off
helpless
before
the
wind
and
pitched
against
that
had
to
retreat
before
her
the
other
seeing
the
fate
of
its
companion
lost
heart
and
turned
aside
held
at
bay
by
the
yacht
whose
crew
raked
it
with
a
fire
of
musketry
seven

saved
in
the
time
gained
by
the
action
of
the

had
forced
his
way
through
the
squadrons
of
the
red
and
the
ships
surrounding
de
ruyter
placed
between
two
fires
beat
a
hasty
retreat
van

having
rescued
the
flagship
went
to
the
aid
of
his
brother
john
van
nes
who
was
engaged
with
the
remaining
ships
of
the
blue
division
the
duke
of
york
loath
to
give
in
hastened
to
the
assistance
of
the
english
and
courageously
continued
to
fight
from
his
third
battered
flagship
but
the
english
were
dispirited
and
weary
and
after
three
broadsides
from
the
advancing
dutch
they
dispersed
in
sullen
confusion
falling
back
with
tattered
canvas
and
disabled
rigging
on
to
their
own
coast
banckert
returning
from
his
pursuit
of
the
french
came
up
with
his
fleet
as
evening
fell
and
his
appearance
changed
the
retreat
of
the
english
into
a
flight
nightfall
alone
saved
them
from
utter
destruction
after
twelve
hours
of
fierce
and
desperate
fighting
the
states
general
had
achieved
a
glorious
victory
they
had
destroyed
five
of
the
enemy
s
finest
vessels
including
the
two
flagships
disabled
many
others
and
were
themselves
the
worse
only
by
two
frigates
and
some
the
english
had
lost
three
thousand
men
and
a
large
number
had
been
taken
prisoner
it
is
god
s
will
was
all
michael
de
ruyter
said
he
stood
beside
the
heroic
ruard
s
chair
his
hands
clasped
behind
him
his
lips
compressed
under
his
pointed
moustache
cornelius
de
witt
was
very
pale
he
leant
against
the
back
of
his
chair
and
now
and
then
wiped
his
lips
and
his
brow
but
though
fatigue
and
pain
drove
the
colour
from
his
face
nothing
could
subdue
the
fire
of
his
eye
or
the
undaunted
carriage
of
his
head
he
had
seen
six
of
his
guard
fall
beside
him
and
been
all
day
exposed
to
the
hottest
fire
of
the
enemy
the
admiral
s
ship
had
been
always
in
the
fiercest
part
of
the
battle
for
twelve
hours
cornelius
de
witt
had
listened
to
the
thunder
of
the
cannon
and
watched
the
smoke
and
flame
arising
from
the
struggle
now
in
the
hour
of
victory
he
simply
thanked
god
and
slipped
his
sword
into
its
scabbard
the
sailors
were
carrying
the
wounded
below
throwing
the
dead
overboard
and
washing
the
decks
the
stars
came
out
pale
gold
and
luminous
and
a
gentle
wind
played
with
the
drooping
canvas
on
a
hundred
ships
the
lanterns
gleamed
at
mast
and
prow
and
from
a
hundred
decks
arose
a
service
of
thanksgiving
the
lord
be
praised
said
cornelius
de
witt
the
lieutenant
who
had
escaped
from
royal
and
who
had
been
brought
on
board
the
flagship
as
a
prisoner
was
amazed
at
all
that
he
saw
at
the
discipline
among
the
large
silent
sailors
at
the
dexterous
fashion
in
which
they
cleaned
the
ship
that
had
started
that
morning
fresh
as
a
lady
s
chamber
at
their
care
of
the
wounded
and
their
respect
to
de
witt
and
de
ruyter
and
most
of
all
at
their
gathering
on
the
where
every
man
even
to
the
pilot
behind
his
shining
brass
rails
joined
in
a
strong
and
lusty
singing
of
psalms
that
michael
de
ruyter
selected
from
his
leathern
they
are
an
extraordinary
people
the
englishman
wrote
home
m
de
ruyter
is
everything
in
one
admiral
captain
pilot
sailor
soldier
and
preacher
too
it
now
that
the
last
shot
had
been
fired
and
the
song
of
thanksgiving
sent
up
by
all
no
matter
to
which
of
the
seven
sects
he
belonged
and
the
sailors
were
mending
the
sails
and
tarring
the
holes
in
the
boats
cornelius
de
witt
was
carried
below
and
before
touching
food
or
drink
added
to
the
letter
to
his
brother
the
news
of
the
victory
he
wrote
briefly
and
modestly
and
concluded
with
these
words
written
with
a
hand
shaking
with
sickness
and
fatigue
i
am
of
opinion
that
we
should
begin
again
as
soon
as
possible
i
hope
god
will
grant
us
the
strength
necessary
for
continuing
to
the
death
to
do
service
to
my
dear
chapter
ix
the
embassy
of
de
groot
from
fagel
said
florent
in
a
tired
voice
showing
his
passport
the
officer
summoned
by
the
sentry
nodded
you
had
best
see
beverningh
he
said
his
highness
has
gone
to
inspect
the
fortifications
of
florent
followed
him
through
the
encampment
silently
the
prince
who
had
been
forced
to
abandon
the
yssel
had
gathered
his
troops
on
to
the
high
district
of
rutten
before
amersfoort
and
utrecht
so
as
to
defend
the
entry
to
the
states
of
holland
florent
looked
to
right
and
left
of
him
and
wondered
at
the
quiet
and
order
the
wild
and
vague
reports
of
the
war
its
sieges
disasters
retreats
current
at
the
hague
had
not
prepared
him
for
this
monotonous
expanse
of
tents
and
wooden
shelters
through
which
little
groups
of
men
and
horses
moved
without
noise
it
was
hazy
afternoon
the
sunshine
was
thick
and
yellow
like
honey
over
the
canvas
the
trampled
ground
and
the
distant
belt
of
dark
trees
beyond
which
on
a
slight
incline
rose
a
windmill
with
sluggish
sails
and
a
thatch
stained
golden
the
warm
air
seemed
to
wrap
the
sound
of
things
close
by
with
a
sense
of
distance
the
fierce
sweet
song
of
a
lark
that
hovered
a
few
feet
up
the
jangle
of
the
harness
as
the
horses
tossed
their
heads
the
crackling
of
twigs
as
one
man
lit
a
fire
at
his
tent
door
came
faintly
through
the
veil
of
the
languid
summer
haze
florent
and
his
companion
traversed
the
encampment
and
made
their
way
across
a
strip
of
meadow
to
a
farm
with
green
cowsheds
adjoining
neat
white
curtains
at
the
windows
the
deputies
are
staying
here
explained
the
officer
my
message
was
to
the
well
you
can
see
beverningh
answered
the
other
as
if
it
were
much
the
same
thing
in
the
beautifully
kept
garden
filled
with
stocks
pinks
and
gillyflowers
a
maid
in
a
blue
gown
was
scouring
brass
pans
seeing
them
approach
she
stood
up
hastily
and
wiped
her
bare
arms
wind
and
to
a
deep
rose
tell
beverningh
there
is
a
gentleman
here
from
the
she
gave
a
great
courtesy
and
hastened
into
the
house
her
gold
head
ornaments
tinkling
florent
van
mander
stole
a
furtive
glance
at
the
officer
who
stood
contemplating
with
unmoved
face
a
precise
bed
of
striped
stocks
and
southernwood
florent
wondered
what
his
thoughts
were
he
longed
to
ask
him
concerning
the
advance
of
the
french
and
what
his
feelings
were
about
the
loss
of
the
fortresses
on
the
rhine
and
the
yssel
but
both
his
own
reserve
and
the
officer
s
demeanour
came
in
his
way
so
he
too
gazed
at
the
flowers
and
the
brass
pans
shining
in
the
sun
and
a
fat
white
cat
asleep
on
the
the
girl
reappearing
announced
in
a
hushed
respectful
voice
that
beverningh
had
come
down
into
the
parlour
and
would
see
them
there
they
entered
a
passage
flagged
with
black
and
white
and
turned
into
a
room
at
the
back
of
the
house
florent
was
aware
of
a
gentleman
standing
before
the
fireplace
with
his
head
bent
on
one
side
mynheer
said
the
officer
this
is
mynheer
van
mander
sent
by
mynheer
fagel
to
his
highness
as
his
highness
has
not
yet
returned
from
amersfoort
i
brought
him
to
very
good
said
jerome
beverningh
will
you
please
sit
down
mynheer
the
officer
saluted
and
withdrew
florent
van
mander
took
the
chair
within
the
door
and
turned
his
gaze
critically
upon
the
delegate
of
the
states
of
holland
he
saw
a
slight
man
with
a
hooked
nose
a
thin
mouth
and
a
stooping
figure
dressed
richly
but
carelessly
in
velvet
he
held
his
hands
behind
him
and
regarded
his
visitor
with
large
intelligent
brown
eyes
you
are
from
fagel
yes
florent
felt
weary
and
unreasonably
depressed
the
incongruity
with
his
feelings
of
the
neat
farmhouse
parlour
furnished
with
curtains
and
hangings
of
checked
stuff
its
bright
pictures
and
highly
polished
furniture
its
white
glazed
hearth
and
tiled
floor
gave
him
unreasonable
annoyance
he
had
been
greatly
elated
at
the
secretary
s
choice
of
him
for
a
messenger
but
he
wished
to
see
the
prince
not
the
representative
of
the
states
of
holland
and
the
news
of
growing
almost
hopeless
disaster
that
had
met
him
on
his
way
filled
him
against
himself
with
disgust
well
asked
jerome
beverningh
what
has
fagel
to
say
the
young
man
hesitated
i
know
continued
the
other
remarking
it
that
you
have
come
to
his
highness
but
i
think
that
you
may
safely
speak
to
my
errand
is
no
secret
said
florent
but
still
half
reluctantly
the
representative
of
holland
smiled
and
i
am
in
the
prince
s
he
crossed
slowly
to
a
beeswaxed
table
by
the
window
that
held
his
handsome
and
silver
and
seated
himself
in
a
chair
it
comes
to
van
mander
spoke
with
sudden
bluntness
m
de
witt
heard
of
the
passage
of
the
rhine
half
the
republic
is
lost
he
cried
when
they
told
him
wesel
had
fallen
this
for
all
his
and
the
next
day
in
council
he
induced
their
high
mightinesses
to
send
an
embassy
to
the
king
of
hah
exclaimed
jerome
beverningh
stroking
his
chin
in
some
subtle
way
florent
was
encouraged
to
speak
openly
the
touch
of
sullenness
left
his
manner
m
fagel
was
won
over
de
witt
carried
everything
before
him
no
one
dare
resist
him
in
face
of
the
advance
of
the
french
van
ghent
de
groot
and
van
odyk
are
being
sent
to
king
louis
and
fagel
sent
you
on
an
attempt
to
justify
himself
to
the
prince
remarked
jerome
beverningh
shrewdly
yes
certainly
this
news
will
not
please
his
m
fagel
feared
jerome
beverningh
twisted
his
thin
mouth
he
risks
his
highness
favour
was
he
frightened
m
de
witt
i
think
and
de
witt
is
the
head
of
the
government
was
the
dry
answer
though
every
day
more
unpopular
but
he
had
the
assembly
with
him
in
this
he
carried
all
before
him
mynheer
there
was
scarcely
a
when
his
highness
is
out
of
it
de
witt
is
the
strongest
man
in
the
hague
remarked
jerome
beverningh
he
can
do
what
he
pleases
methinks
despite
his
unpopularity
is
not
sending
some
one
to
acquaint
us
with
this
news
the
envoys
themselves
mynheer
are
to
explain
their
mission
i
believe
they
will
soon
be
at
the
camp
it
was
fagel
s
wish
that
i
should
anticipate
them
with
his
highness
beverningh
interrupted
pleasantly
and
soften
the
news
fagel
is
he
seemed
agitated
mynheer
that
he
had
been
forced
to
support
de
witt
and
anxious
not
to
slip
in
his
highness
good
graces
i
have
a
letter
from
the
elder
man
swung
round
on
his
chair
he
looked
little
and
stooping
but
his
eyes
were
calm
and
clever
you
have
heard
news
of
the
war
he
demanded
briskly
what
every
one
has
heard
yes
answered
florent
mostly
disasters
mostly
disasters
and
you
like
de
witt
have
been
discouraged
florent
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
do
not
say
but
you
think
that
peace
would
be
desirable
eh
i
think
we
must
have
peace
or
conquest
well
said
jerome
beverningh
thoughtfully
m
de
witt
is
a
clever
man
but
he
will
never
conclude
a
peace
while
the
prince
has
any
influence
in
the
united
florent
was
interested
his
highness
is
so
against
it
were
his
highness
in
power
there
would
be
no
embassy
sent
to
king
beverningh
spoke
in
a
pleasant
quiet
manner
as
if
he
touched
on
matters
of
general
interest
that
did
not
personally
concern
either
himself
or
his
listener
he
made
a
great
semblance
of
frankness
yet
most
effectually
concealed
his
own
feelings
and
views
florent
liked
him
he
felt
emboldened
to
speak
much
more
freely
than
was
his
wont
the
peace
proposals
are
not
popular
at
the
hague
either
mynheer
the
people
choose
to
take
it
as
an
attempt
to
sell
them
to
the
french
and
de
witt
is
daily
attacked
in
the
ah
we
are
a
nation
of
pamphleteers
and
medallists
we
have
all
been
assailed
in
turn
de
witt
hath
more
serious
things
to
trouble
him
than
beverningh
changed
his
tone
you
marvel
to
hear
the
representative
of
the
government
speak
so
openly
mynheer
van
mander
but
i
am
his
highness
florent
was
surprised
he
stared
at
the
calm
wrinkled
face
of
jerome
beverningh
without
comment
if
any
one
can
save
the
country
it
will
be
the
prince
beverningh
continued
he
has
a
hard
task
said
florent
for
most
men
an
impossible
one
but
his
highness
is
not
of
the
common
make
he
has
great
gifts
above
all
the
gift
of
is
he
popular
in
the
army
asked
florent
he
alone
keeps
the
army
together
the
men
are
yet
the
cavalry
do
the
work
of
the
infantry
the
officers
will
dig
trenches
and
make
and
there
is
no
complaint
because
of
the
the
news
of
the
battle
of
solebay
heartened
them
suggested
florent
mentioning
the
one
success
that
had
attended
the
dutch
flag
since
the
beginning
of
this
disastrous
war
a
little
but
the
issue
lies
on
land
his
highness
was
not
ah
de
witt
was
with
the
fleet
exactly
it
was
a
victory
for
the
republic
not
for
the
orange
flag
and
his
highness
does
not
love
de
ruyter
both
because
he
is
a
friend
to
the
mm
de
witt
and
because
he
is
of
common
why
does
that
trouble
him
jerome
beverningh
rose
be
not
deceived
by
simple
manners
he
said
his
highness
is
the
very
proudest
man
i
have
ever
met
and
if
he
does
not
flaunt
it
in
the
tamerlane
fashion
of
his
christian
majesty
it
strikes
root
the
deeper
for
as
he
spoke
he
put
his
papers
into
his
and
locked
it
we
will
see
if
his
highness
has
not
returned
from
amersfoort
it
were
better
if
you
could
give
him
fagel
s
letter
before
de
witt
s
envoys
beverningh
picked
up
his
black
beaver
with
the
purple
feather
and
preceded
florent
out
of
the
farm
into
the
garden
of
stocks
and
pinks
as
they
crossed
the
quiet
camp
respectfully
saluted
by
such
soldiers
as
they
passed
beverningh
spoke
in
his
easy
judicial
way
of
the
deficiencies
of
the
army
the
lack
of
the
forced
levies
of
peasants
who
had
nothing
but
their
goodwill
to
recommend
them
and
the
number
of
foreigners
scotch
irish
and
swedes
in
the
army
and
how
these
were
by
no
means
to
be
trusted
indeed
it
was
to
the
presence
of
these
hired
soldiers
that
the
fall
of
the
rhine
fortresses
was
attributed
netherlanders
said
beverningh
do
not
open
their
gates
to
the
enemy
without
a
he
added
that
the
prince
though
struggling
with
and
disappointment
was
beyond
all
praise
in
the
way
in
which
he
kept
his
army
disciplined
faithful
and
despite
his
constant
reverses
encouraged
the
captains
who
had
surrendered
wesel
to
the
french
had
joined
the
camp
and
the
prince
had
instantly
dismissed
them
his
service
for
so
strangely
forgetting
their
m
de
montbas
division
comes
up
with
us
concluded
beverningh
we
shall
see
what
welcome
his
highness
gives
him
he
allowed
the
french
to
cross
the
rhine
without
a
florent
raised
his
brows
would
his
highness
dare
with
his
restricted
authority
to
reprimand
de
montbas
we
shall
see
repeated
jerome
beverningh
dryly
as
they
reached
the
tents
the
deputy
of
holland
pointed
out
the
one
belonging
to
the
prince
and
at
the
moment
a
blonde
gentleman
in
grey
advanced
from
it
to
meet
them
at
sight
of
beverningh
s
companion
he
gave
a
surprised
smile
m

i

i
was
coming
to
find
you
or

of

matthew

half
laughed
why
there
are
two
of
his
highness
mortal
enemies
waiting
for
him
de

and
van

accompanied
by
van

and
a
posse

to

beverningh
looked
at
florent
why
then
you
are
too
late
he
said
and
walked
ahead
with
rapid
steps
the
prince
s
tent
was
large
and
divided
by
a
dark
curtain
the
outer
half
was
furnished
with
a
few
chairs
a
table
and
a
chest
beside
which
lay
some
armour
and
a
black
cloak
the
grass
before
it
was
not
yet
worn
away
and
one
flap
being
lifted
a
flood
of
heavy
sunshine
poured
in
through
the
open
square
here
beverningh
found
van
ghent
pale
and
in
mourning
de
groot
elegant
calm
but
anxious
in
converse
with
ripperda
de
buryse
the
deputy
for
guelders
and
crommon
the
representative
of
zeeland
standing
apart
was
van
odyk
very
handsomely
attired
since
van
eyck
had
been
objected
to
by
the
state
of
groningen
he
alone
represented
the
prince
s
party
in
the
embassy
beverningh
greeted
them
all
impartially
matthew
bromley
and
florent
entered
behind
him
the
englishman
dragging
news
of
the
hague
from
his
slow
companion
the
steady
sound
of
low
earnest
voices
filled
the
tent
only
william
van
odyk
stood
silent
staring
at
the
ground
it
was
very
quiet
without
so
quiet
that
the
sudden
jingle
of
harness
and
sound
of
a
horse
s
hoofs
made
them
abruptly
hold
their
converse
the
second
flap
was
lifted
beverningh
stepped
forward
the
prince
entered
quickly
followed
by
william
bentinck
the
bar
of
sunshine
making
a
dazzle
before
his
eyes
and
the
other
men
being
withdrawn
into
the
shadows
he
did
not
instantly
perceive
any
one
but
bromley
and
the
deputy
for
holland
m
beverningh
he
said
breathlessly
m
beverningh
ah
what
is
this
that
they
tell
me
that
de
witt
he
stepped
forward
and
at
the
same
time
checked
his
words
for
he
saw
the
little
group
behind
the
table
a
complete
silence
fell
and
though
it
endured
but
a
moment
it
was
long
enough
to
take
effect
william
stood
suddenly
motionless
he
cast
his
large
eyes
over
the
men
facing
him
as
if
he
found
himself
in
some
trap
m
de
groot
he
said
at
length
you
have
a
message
for
me
from
de
his
manner
and
his
voice
were
cold
but
it
was
not
the
coldness
of
indifference
his
entry
had
brought
into
the
tent
a
spirit
of
passion
and
hostility
it
seemed
to
florent
that
two
parties
had
instantly
formed
the
prince
s
friends
and
his
enemies
these
are
the
commissioners
from
the
states
general
your
highness
began
jerome
beverningh
suavely
william
cut
him
short
so
count
struym
told
the
embassy
came
forward
to
van
odyk
and
de
groot
his
greeting
was
curt
to
van
ghent
he
said
i
am
sorry
about
your
brother
mynheer
but
it
was
a
fortunate
way
to
van
ghent
bowed
in
silence
the
prince
leant
against
the
little
table
and
looked
from
him
to
de
groot
he
had
never
made
any
pretence
of
concealing
his
dislike
to
either
of
them
and
it
was
plain
that
he
regarded
them
both
as
his
enemies
and
their
coming
on
this
errand
as
an
insult
peter
de
groot
always
courtly
began
by
prefacing
his
errand
with
courtesies
but
william
checked
them
will
you
be
good
enough
to
say
at
once
what
you
have
come
to
say
he
said
in
a
chilling
tone
i
have
a
press
of
they
were
all
standing
the
representatives
of
the
states
general
facing
the
prince
who
had
bentinck
behind
him
he
rested
one
hand
on
the
table
the
other
in
his
sword
strap
he
wore
a
black
cuirass
over
a
leather
coat
and
a
black
silk
sash
and
scarf
trimmed
with
gold
round
his
neck
hung
a
star
on
a
crimson
ribbon
there
was
a
great
deal
of
malines
lace
about
his
wrists
and
in
his
brown
beaver
a
long
black
feather
fastened
with
a
sapphire
brooch
florent
thought
he
looked
very
ill
yet
in
comparison
with
the
weighty
men
surrounding
him
very
young
de
groot
accepted
his
rebuke
with
courtly
good
temper
he
was
a
man
of
wide
experience
not
easily
embarrassed
m
de
witt
and
their
high
mightinesses
consider
the
state
of
the
country
justifies
extraordinary
means
of
he
spoke
formally
as
much
to
beverningh
as
to
the
prince
the
representative
of
the
states
was
as
important
in
his
eyes
as
the
captain
general
his
mission
was
to
both
m
de
witt
hearing
of
the
passage
of
the
rhine
by
the
french
troops
and
of
the
fall
of
the
forts
on
the
frontier
has
decided
to
send
an
embassy
to
the
king
of
france
to
know
what
terms
he
will
take
having
obtained
the
consent
of
their
high
mightinesses
myself
van
ghent
and
odyk
are
appointed
to
convey
to
his
majesty
the
letter
of
the
states
general
we
are
now
on
our
way
to
the
castle
of
keppel
where
the
king
of
france
is
to
be
found
with
de
louvois
and
following
our
instructions
have
stopped
here
to
acquaint
you
beverningh
and
his
during
this
speech
william
had
not
taken
his
eyes
from
de
groot
when
the
speaker
finished
with
a
little
bow
the
prince
glanced
quickly
and
keenly
round
the
company
was
there
no
opposition
to
de
witt
he
asked
and
florent
knew
that
he
thought
of
gaspard
fagel
none
your
the
states
are
easily
frightened
said
the
prince
scornfully
and
bitterly
your
highness
does
not
approve
asked
de
groot
with
his
easy
air
of
elegance
he
was
a
handsome
man
very
finely
dressed
with
placid
lips
and
tired
eyes
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
he
was
hateful
in
the
eyes
of
william
of
orange
but
it
did
not
in
the
least
disturb
his
composure
the
silence
of
the
onlookers
grew
tense
to
painfulness
so
obvious
and
without
disguise
was
the
cold
aversion
of
the
two
men
facing
each
other
you
are
a
bold
man
to
undertake
this
commission
said
the
prince
evading
a
direct
answer
it
will
require
careful
treading
de
i
am
aware
of
the
danger
that
i
incur
perhaps
not
quite
replied
william
in
an
intense
quiet
tone
this
embassy
mynheer
is
utterly
and
entirely
against
my
a
little
stir
went
through
the
spectators
peter
de
groot
was
not
taken
aback
i
act
on
the
orders
of
de
witt
and
you
may
please
de
witt
by
your
compliance
with
his
wishes
but
you
will
not
please
william
s
dark
eyes
held
his
opponent
s
with
a
bold
expression
of
angry
disdain
must
i
remind
your
highness
that
you
have
no
share
in
the
civil
government
william
drew
a
deep
breath
had
i
there
would
be
no
talk
of
peace
peter
de
groot
eyed
him
straightly
it
seems
as
if
you
threaten
me
i
warn
you
and
your
companions
not
to
go
on
this
de
groot
bowed
i
thank
your
highness
but
i
am
bound
to
carry
out
the
instructions
given
me
by
their
high
you
are
very
rash
said
william
peter
de
groot
answered
proudly
perhaps
i
am
highness
i
undertake
a
difficult
and
thankless
task
but
there
is
some
hope
for
the
republic
while
she
can
find
those
who
will
sacrifice
themselves
for
do
you
think
that
you
serve
your
country
by
this
humiliating
errand
demanded
the
prince
angrily
i
think
replied
de
groot
with
calm
dignity
that
i
undertake
a
dangerous
embassy
in
difficult
times
i
think
highness
that
i
carry
with
me
the
destinies
of
my
what
terms
are
you
to
offer
france
william
s
eyes
narrowed
and
his
lips
compressed
i
have
full
powers
to
conclude
a
peace
on
any
terms
on
the
best
terms
de
louvois
will
my
god
cried
william
with
irrepressible
passion
and
what
do
you
think
louis
will
ask
we
hope
that
de
louvois
will
be
reasonable
and
his
majesty
generous
repeated
the
prince
very
pale
have
we
come
to
sue
the
generosity
of
the
french
he
took
a
step
towards
de
groot
his
hand
on
his
and
those
who
saw
his
face
perceived
that
he
could
hate
that
he
could
prove
implacable
i
have
some
authority
here
at
you
will
leave
the
your
highness
began
van
odyk
william
turned
on
the
three
of
them
you
can
go
he
said
and
sell
your
country
for
the
highest
price
you
can
get
but
you
will
not
find
it
easy
to
put
the
purchaser
in
now
peter
de
groot
flushed
hotly
it
is
better
to
save
a
portion
than
to
lose
all
he
said
and
i
do
not
think
my
diplomacy
can
be
less
successful
than
your
highness
the
prince
cast
a
flashing
glance
on
him
and
the
colour
sprang
slightly
into
his
hollow
cheeks
you
are
even
bolder
than
i
thought
de
groot
but
as
you
say
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
civil
government
there
will
be
a
go
to
the
king
of
france
and
take
his
terms
and
see
the
lands
ploughed
up
and
sown
with
salt
that
no
one
may
benefit
by
them
even
to
the
third
he
sat
down
in
the
humble
chair
by
the
little
table
and
rested
his
brow
in
his
gloved
hand
to
those
who
watched
it
was
painful
knowing
his
usual
composure
to
see
how
moved
he
was
he
deigned
no
further
word
to
the
commissioners
who
left
the
tent
accompanied
by
the
deputies
of
the
state
bentinck
questioned
bromley
aside
as
to
van
mander
s
presence
florent
came
forward
with
some
awe
on
him
he
did
not
dare
address
the
prince
i
am
come
with
a
letter
from
fagel
he
ventured
to
william
bentinck
the
prince
looked
up
at
the
name
what
is
that
you
say
he
asked
florent
approached
gave
some
stumbling
explanation
that
william
did
not
seem
to
hear
and
delivered
the
secretary
s
letter
the
prince
put
it
down
unopened
it
seems
that
there
is
no
one
at
the
hague
can
resist
de
witt
he
said
then
he
roused
himself
to
speak
to
matthew
bromley
take
fagel
s
messenger
to
your
quarters
it
may
be
that
i
shall
want
to
see
him
when
the
two
had
gone
william
bentinck
came
softly
forward
the
sunlight
that
was
taking
on
a
richer
deeper
hue
fell
through
the
tent
opening
and
lit
up
the
golden
inlay
and
garnishing
of
his
armour
and
the
bright
rings
of
his
fair
hair
the
prince
took
off
his
hat
and
pushed
the
locks
back
off
his
forehead
ah
william
he
said
in
a
tone
of
anguish
can
it
be
possible
these
republicans
are
very
stubborn
william
clenched
his
hand
on
the
table
m
de
witt
he
cried
passionately
will
he
never
cease
to
thwart
me
to
humiliate
and
insult
me
he
must
go
he
must
break
if
he
will
not
bend
by
heaven
he
how
dare
he
his
words
were
checked
by
a
cough
he
shook
as
if
in
bodily
pain
and
pressed
his
hand
to
his
shining
corselet
over
his
heart
what
i
have
endured
what
i
have
taken
never
worse
than
this
to
send
those
two
it
was
very
insolently
done
said
bentinck
hotly
it
was
done
in
contempt
to
show
me
the
cipher
that
i
am
he
got
to
his
feet
in
the
restlessness
of
passion
his
face
was
quite
colourless
and
in
his
eyes
was
an
agony
of
bitter
emotion
they
have
gone
to
cringe
to
louis
think
of
it
william
to
cringe
to
the
french
while
we
have
a
man
left
who
can
grasp
a
again
his
cough
took
him
and
he
had
to
hold
his
side
van
odyk
too
he
goes
to
represent
your
highness
i
do
he
goes
because
he
is
afraid
of
de
witt
flashed
the
prince
if
he
had
loved
me
he
had
not
bentinck
looked
at
his
master
in
affectionate
distress
he
knew
not
what
to
do
or
say
his
own
blood
beat
high
at
the
thought
of
suing
to
louis
for
peace
oh
heart
heart
what
i
have
taken
cried
william
through
his
teeth
ah
to
be
so
powerless
so
hedged
about
so
humbled
hampered
always
by
the
inadequacy
of
others
had
they
sent
me
more
men
i
had
not
been
retreating
now
but
de
witt
keeps
me
starved
in
my
supplies
sets
me
to
build
with
sand
we
do
not
need
these
smooth
lawyers
to
feed
the
arrogance
of
louis
with
their
whinings
for
peace
but
more
men
to
send
the
french
back
across
the
he
pulled
his
gloves
off
and
crushed
them
in
his
beautiful
right
hand
if
i
had
had
the
garrisoning
of
those
rhine
forts
he
said
with
a
gasping
breath
they
had
never
de
witt
s
paid
adventurers
came
dear
after
all
his
the
prince
pressed
his
forehead
with
a
little
sound
of
desperation
then
as
was
his
habit
when
he
had
been
moved
to
speak
freely
even
to
bentinck
he
fell
into
a
deeper
reserve
as
if
he
regretted
what
he
had
said
will
you
take
some
rest
now
asked
bentinck
anxiously
i
will
write
to
fagel
and
some
other
people
i
think
to
fall
back
on
utrecht
returned
the
prince
briefly
amersfoort
is
well
fortified
and
should
hold
will
you
see
sylvius
if
he
arrives
yes
and
any
other
messenger
from
there
is
to
be
a
council
meeting
and
a
review
afterwards
we
must
hearten
the
you
do
too
much
that
is
impossible
i
should
do
more
i
wish
i
had
your
strength
he
added
suddenly
this
was
a
matter
he
seldom
spoke
of
and
bentinck
was
abashed
a
gift
i
share
with
every
common
soldier
he
answered
they
are
to
be
envied
said
william
rather
grimly
he
had
regained
his
composure
of
manner
and
his
control
but
he
looked
tired
and
sick
to
swooning
point
bentinck
could
not
bear
to
hear
him
cough
will
you
see
if
you
can
get
better
lamps
for
he
said
the
fumes
of
these
choke
he
pressed
bentinck
s
hand
affectionately
took
up
fagel
s
letter
and
lifting
the
curtain
entered
the
inner
part
of
the
tent
chapter
x
the
vicomte
de
montbas
two
hours
later
william
bentinck
returned
to
the
prince
s
tent
the
sun
had
set
in
a
splendour
of
tawny
vapour
and
a
warm
yet
damp
wind
blew
over
the
low
and
melancholy
looking
land
and
a
misty
heaviness
was
abroad
the
outer
portion
of
the
tent
was
empty
behind
the
green
curtain
bentinck
found
the
prince
alone
writing
at
a
small
one
of
the
william
had
complained
of
gave
a
bright
but
flickering
light
in
the
corner
stood
a
bed
with
a
red
coverlet
and
near
it
an
iron
and
leather
the
key
in
the
lock
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
was
a
large
trunk
that
seemed
to
have
been
ransacked
for
something
in
a
hurry
for
it
stood
open
and
linen
shirts
and
cravats
were
tossed
up
and
trailed
on
to
the
grassy
floor
that
was
a
shade
of
unhealthy
yellow
in
the
artificial
light
the
prince
s
armour
that
he
evaded
when
he
could
finding
the
weight
unsupportable
lay
heaped
up
by
the
trunk
and
on
a
chair
rested
a
violet
leather
case
showing
a
number
of
articles
in
carved
gold
william
nodded
at
bentinck
and
hastily
added
his
name
to
the
letter
he
was
writing
it
is
gabriel
sylvius
said
bentinck
who
is
arrived
having
pressed
on
without
stopping
from
the
ah
said
the
prince
quickly
then
i
expected
him
he
was
delayed
the
prince
frowned
a
little
on
the
sea
he
william
still
looked
stern
they
were
fifteen
hours
in
calais
why
the
prince
admitted
that
was
a
misfortune
beyond
the
help
of
gabriel
bentinck
seated
himself
he
was
monstrous
sick
is
now
something
one
may
not
wonder
after
fifteen
hours
in
calais
roads
answered
the
prince
with
grim
sympathy
he
had
nearly
died
of
his
own
crossing
last
year
well
he
added
where
is
sylvius
in
the
camp
but
bentinck
hesitated
i
will
see
highness
on
my
soul
you
take
too
much
fatigue
upon
yourself
wait
until
the
nay
i
will
see
him
now
answered
william
had
it
been
any
other
than
bentinck
he
would
have
spoken
angrily
it
is
not
long
before
the
council
if
you
would
rest
if
you
would
fetch
sir
gabriel
sylvius
my
child
said
the
prince
folding
up
his
letter
bentinck
gave
in
but
protesting
when
he
returned
with
william
s
confidential
agent
he
found
the
prince
in
the
same
place
writing
again
he
stopped
immediately
on
their
entrance
it
gives
me
great
pleasure
to
see
you
sylvius
william
bring
another
he
looked
round
the
tent
we
are
not
very
luxurious
here
nor
very
neat
he
seemed
for
the
first
time
to
realise
the
disorder
about
him
i
told
bromley
to
see
to
this
but
he
spends
too
much
time
playing
sylvius
went
on
one
knee
and
kissed
his
master
s
hand
so
you
had
a
bad
crossing
william
pushed
back
his
chair
and
smiled
hideous
your
highness
i
thought
that
never
should
we
gain
the
the
secret
agent
gabriel
sylvius
was
a
tall
lean
man
with
a
shrewd
and
lined
countenance
hair
of
a
harsh
reddish
colour
and
a
freckled
skin
he
looked
keenly
at
the
prince
he
had
been
in
his
father
s
service
and
greatly
loved
the
house
of
orange
i
am
sorry
to
see
your
highness
look
so
ill
he
said
bluntly
no
matter
for
that
answered
william
impatiently
what
of
england
the
envoy
answered
with
a
touch
of
satisfaction
i
think
that
i
can
claim
some
amount
of
in
what
way
the
prince
s
tranquil
mien
could
hardly
disguise
his
eagerness
sir
gabriel
began
as
concise
an
account
of
his
sojourn
in
london
as
he
could
manage
sit
down
said
william
when
he
came
to
a
pause
bentinck
was
also
listening
with
rapt
attention
his
comely
face
absorbed
and
keen
i
saw
king
charles
continued
sylvius
he
was
more
than
friendly
to
me
or
to
the
states
asked
the
prince
quietly
to
your
highness
he
declared
that
he
had
largely
undertaken
this
war
on
your
highness
account
to
put
you
in
possession
of
your
ancient
rights
and
that
your
advantages
were
bargained
for
in
the
treaty
between
himself
and
his
christian
william
repeated
softly
my
advantages
so
he
termed
it
the
prince
looked
quickly
at
bentinck
as
if
to
discover
what
his
friend
thought
of
this
well
go
on
king
charles
railed
against
the
states
and
de
witt
he
declared
he
had
always
your
advancement
at
heart
and
would
never
forget
your
father
s
goodness
to
him
when
he
was
in
exile
at
the
much
more
very
pleasant
but
without
definite
did
you
see
any
beside
the
king
some
few
i
managed
to
sound
highness
but
since
the
ambassador
of
the
states
had
been
asked
to
leave
and
the
french
were
very
jealous
i
had
to
be
private
all
but
the
court
party
are
against
the
and
the
parliament
they
would
bring
great
pressure
on
the
king
to
make
have
they
not
that
power
with
the
grants
the
king
is
subsidised
by
france
and
by
many
of
the
william
narrowed
his
eyes
and
the
people
are
fiercely
in
favour
of
peace
they
hate
the
french
and
look
on
the
war
as
a
there
seems
some
hope
in
england
said
william
slowly
certainly
answered
sylvius
it
is
in
a
state
of
unrest
the
king
hath
shut
up
the
exchequer
thereby
ruining
many
of
the
merchants
and
yet
vast
sums
are
spent
at
court
and
on
that
foreign
woman
louise
de
la
querouaille
who
came
over
with
the
late
duchess
d
orleans
and
is
no
better
than
a
spy
of
france
the
duke
of
york
is
unpopular
like
his
mother
before
him
and
rumours
are
abroad
that
the
king
to
please
the
king
of
france
is
a
concealed
papist
which
is
the
truth
and
that
the
great
lords
are
all
in
the
pay
of
which
is
also
the
truth
it
seems
remarked
the
prince
yet
the
king
has
an
easy
way
of
agreeableness
that
keeps
him
where
he
is
and
he
is
very
prodigal
of
promises
and
hath
managed
to
smooth
many
an
situation
by
his
fair
manners
i
doubt
his
sincerity
certainly
in
what
he
said
to
me
yet
i
hope
the
english
may
force
him
into
breaking
with
france
i
may
hope
so
the
prince
looked
at
him
keenly
but
at
the
moment
what
will
my
uncle
do
now
sir
in
this
i
have
been
a
trifle
successful
his
majesty
was
so
far
moved
by
your
appeals
that
he
has
appointed
certain
envoys
who
will
come
over
and
look
after
your
interests
during
the
war
they
are
accredited
to
you
to
the
states
and
to
king
louis
and
their
errand
is
to
conclude
a
peace
satisfactory
to
again
william
glanced
at
bentinck
and
when
will
they
arrive
he
asked
highness
three
crossed
with
me
and
my
lord
arlington
was
so
ill
he
cursed
god
that
he
should
have
been
born
in
an
my
lord
arlington
repeated
william
moving
the
lamp
a
little
farther
away
from
him
so
he
is
one
who
are
the
others
my
lord
the
viscount
halifax
my
lord
buckingham
and
the
young
prince
james
of
monmouth
why
said
william
i
think
all
these
are
in
the
pay
of
my
lord
halifax
is
now
in
flanders
bruges
i
think
he
bears
compliments
to
king
louis
on
the
birth
of
the
duc
d
anjou
of
the
others
two
are
now
at
the
hague
whence
they
will
follow
here
or
go
at
once
to
the
french
camp
at
the
prince
spoke
to
bentinck
william
what
hope
have
we
from
these
men
highness
i
mislike
their
i
think
i
met
them
all
in
england
said
the
prince
slowly
give
me
their
names
severally
sylvius
that
i
may
judge
of
their
firstly
the
duke
of
monmouth
he
is
already
with
the
king
of
france
commanding
the
english
pass
him
he
can
serve
no
serious
purpose
interrupted
william
the
earl
of
arlington
i
do
mistrust
him
now
it
is
believed
he
drew
up
the
treaty
of
dover
and
was
well
paid
for
it
is
it
not
i
am
sure
of
it
highness
he
leans
avowedly
to
the
french
then
there
is
my
lord
the
viscount
i
do
remember
him
answered
william
thoughtfully
i
should
think
he
is
honest
for
an
englishman
though
slow
and
lazy
and
finally
his
grace
of
buckingham
highness
who
stands
high
in
favour
with
the
the
prince
was
silent
at
the
name
and
his
eyes
hardened
he
had
ugly
memories
of
buckingham
the
court
of
charles
that
had
flashed
its
brightest
for
his
bewilderment
had
filled
him
only
with
disgust
and
aversion
the
king
at
first
inclined
to
confide
the
treaty
of
dover
to
william
had
found
him
impervious
to
flattery
and
informed
louis
that
his
nephew
was
too
dutch
and
too
protestant
for
anything
to
be
hoped
for
from
but
buckingham
repelled
in
the
advances
he
deemed
irresistible
fell
back
on
his
wit
and
with
the
readiness
of
a
shallow
nature
ridiculed
what
he
could
not
understand
the
prince
led
a
strict
life
and
showed
reserved
manners
here
were
the
subjects
of
numerous
pasquinades
on
his
grace
s
part
william
s
regular
and
firm
adherence
to
the
theology
of
geneva
furnished
matter
for
many
profane
jests
that
were
not
long
in
coming
to
the
young
man
s
ears
and
once
his
grace
edged
on
by
the
king
and
backed
by
many
of
the
ribald
lords
had
tried
to
humiliate
the
austere
youth
of
nineteen
by
intoxicating
him
with
strong
waters
disguised
as
a
cordial
for
his
cough
the
prince
had
discovered
the
trick
soon
enough
to
baulk
them
of
their
amusement
but
not
before
the
mixture
had
made
him
miserably
coldness
had
blunted
the
point
of
the
jest
and
for
once
made
buckingham
feel
foolish
but
the
prince
under
his
passive
exterior
was
bitterly
outraged
on
his
most
sensitive
points
his
religion
and
his
therefore
he
was
silent
at
the
name
of
buckingham
and
a
faint
colour
tinged
his
pallor
the
envoys
bring
with
them
henry
jermyn
and
sir
edward
seymour
continued
sir
gabriel
sylvius
i
did
not
know
jermyn
was
a
politician
said
william
sarcastically
sir
he
like
my
lord
buckingham
has
found
a
new
amusement
that
is
the
prince
made
a
little
movement
as
if
he
roused
himself
i
think
my
uncle
has
sent
me
a
pretty
parcel
of
knaves
he
remarked
calmly
but
it
would
be
difficult
to
discover
an
honest
man
at
their
instructions
may
be
better
than
their
characters
suggested
bentinck
we
will
hope
william
reflected
a
moment
then
addressed
his
secret
agent
i
think
sylvius
it
would
be
well
if
you
join
these
english
again
and
accompany
them
to
the
king
of
he
would
not
mention
the
name
of
the
enemy
s
camp
for
doesburg
where
the
king
lay
was
one
of
his
own
lordships
and
it
was
exceedingly
bitter
to
him
that
the
french
had
taken
it
he
coughed
impatiently
turned
down
the
lamp
that
with
the
slightest
movement
smoked
and
added
you
can
at
least
report
directly
and
truthfully
to
me
on
what
takes
place
these
commissioners
will
colour
matters
to
suit
themselves
and
for
your
further
convenience
you
had
better
take
some
dutch
secretary
he
paused
then
continued
slowly
there
is
one
van
mander
in
bromley
s
quarters
newly
come
from
the
hague
who
will
do
very
sir
gabriel
sylvius
rose
i
am
greatly
obliged
to
you
said
william
for
i
think
you
have
acquitted
yourself
sir
gabriel
kissed
his
hand
mr
bromley
has
some
monies
of
mine
and
he
will
give
you
what
you
need
added
the
prince
evenly
and
i
will
now
tell
you
myself
what
you
will
hear
presently
bruited
abroad
that
de
witt
hath
despatched
an
embassy
for
peace
to
the
king
of
france
which
is
something
i
can
not
talk
surely
highness
answered
sir
gabriel
that
will
fall
in
with
this
deputation
from
i
would
have
the
alliance
of
england
not
peace
with
france
said
the
prince
sternly
sylvius
glanced
at
william
bentinck
and
was
about
to
withdraw
the
officer
without
will
take
you
to
bromley
s
tent
florent
van
mander
is
the
name
of
the
young
man
i
mentioned
you
shall
shortly
hear
from
sir
gabriel
bowed
himself
in
silence
out
of
the
now
tent
the
prince
sat
with
his
elbow
on
the
table
and
his
cheek
in
his
hand
this
is
hopeful
news
surely
said
bentinck
cheerfully
william
smiled
at
him
affectionately
and
tolerantly
possibly
just
possibly
i
might
detach
england
from
bentinck
laughed
you
are
become
a
statesman
as
well
as
a
soldier
sir
and
meditate
great
do
you
imagine
that
these
english
come
with
serious
purpose
to
listen
to
reasonable
terms
asked
the
prince
quickly
i
imagine
king
charles
will
contrive
your
advantage
mine
what
of
the
states
the
states
bentinck
shrugged
his
shoulders
the
states
are
your
enemies
sir
m
de
witt
is
my
enemy
answered
william
which
is
perhaps
another
he
took
the
twisted
silver
melted
the
wax
at
the
lamp
and
sealed
his
letter
i
must
get
this
to
fagel
at
once
or
he
will
fall
again
under
de
witt
s
bentinck
rose
meanwhile
you
had
best
have
some
dinner
sir
it
will
have
been
ready
some
time
and
the
others
waiting
the
prince
took
up
the
lamp
and
followed
his
friend
without
demur
into
the
other
half
of
the
tent
he
went
to
the
entrance
and
called
to
the
officer
on
duty
you
will
find
some
messenger
to
convey
this
at
once
to
the
yes
william
gave
him
the
letter
for
fagel
and
was
turning
away
when
the
soldier
spoke
highness
de
montbas
has
m
de
montbas
the
prince
was
alert
again
instantly
with
his
company
cut
to
pieces
i
will
see
him
said
william
bentinck
protested
after
dinner
sir
this
can
not
what
can
de
montbas
have
to
say
that
is
of
importance
it
is
not
he
it
is
i
who
have
something
to
say
returned
the
prince
send
to
him
he
added
to
the
officer
i
wish
to
see
him
at
bentinck
seated
himself
with
an
air
of
resignation
get
to
your
dinner
smiled
the
prince
i
will
come
nay
sir
not
without
now
william
spoke
with
authority
bentinck
i
will
see
this
man
alone
in
a
while
i
will
join
grimacing
a
little
and
with
a
clatter
of
his
armour
bentinck
left
the
tent
the
prince
turned
up
the
lamp
set
it
carefully
on
the
table
and
walked
up
and
down
keeping
his
gaze
upon
the
ground
when
the
flap
was
lifted
and
a
man
entered
hesitating
william
stopped
where
he
was
by
the
table
and
raised
his
eyes
de
montbas
was
magnificently
dressed
over
his
blue
and
silver
coat
he
wore
falling
off
one
shoulder
and
fastened
across
his
breast
with
a
gilt
chain
a
green
velvet
cloak
there
were
jewels
in
his
cravat
and
holding
the
blue
feather
in
his
beaver
he
wore
a
very
handsome
sword
and
kept
his
hand
on
it
he
was
a
fine
man
if
somewhat
haggard
but
now
a
white
look
on
his
face
and
his
black
eyes
startled
joined
to
his
air
of
hesitation
took
from
him
his
dignity
he
uncovered
and
bowed
william
made
no
answering
salute
but
stood
rigid
looking
slight
and
sombre
in
his
dark
attire
have
you
anything
to
say
he
asked
de
montbas
straightened
himself
i
have
my
report
to
make
your
highness
he
said
in
a
strained
voice
but
your
highness
wished
to
see
me
how
many
men
have
you
with
you
de
montbas
bit
his
lower
lip
i
have
lost
fifteen
hundred
that
is
half
your
we
were
pursued
by
a
detachment
of
cavalry
under
de
and
the
rearguard
and
the
baggage
were
cut
off
the
unfortunate
general
spoke
awkwardly
it
seemed
by
his
demeanour
more
as
if
he
stood
before
a
tribunal
of
judges
than
speaking
alone
to
a
youth
over
twenty
years
his
junior
and
whom
he
had
patronised
as
a
child
you
did
not
offer
fight
demanded
the
prince
your
highness
we
were
hopelessly
outnumbered
by
the
enemy
some
of
the
guns
sank
in
a
polder
the
prince
cut
short
these
excuses
m
de
montbas
he
said
in
a
tone
of
exquisite
anger
i
perceive
you
are
a
very
bad
the
vicomte
took
a
step
to
one
side
in
a
baited
way
what
does
your
highness
mean
he
asked
in
an
agitated
fashion
william
did
not
take
his
eyes
off
him
your
sister
s
husband
de
groot
hath
gone
on
an
embassy
to
make
terms
with
the
king
of
france
and
i
think
you
have
a
mind
to
follow
his
example
you
also
wish
to
stand
well
with
louis
do
you
not
a
dark
colour
tinged
the
frenchman
s
pallid
face
your
highness
can
not
mean
what
it
would
seem
you
for
the
first
time
william
moved
he
came
a
step
nearer
the
other
i
mean
that
you
very
basely
abandoned
the
post
i
gave
you
on
the
rhine
he
spoke
evenly
but
with
a
bitter
dislike
thereby
allowing
easy
passage
to
the
french
which
was
an
irreparable
disaster
and
a
thing
that
could
have
been
de
montbas
took
his
hand
from
his
sword
and
pressed
it
to
the
breast
of
his
shining
cuirass
your
highness
is
unjust
what
could
i
do
with
three
thousand
men
if
ye
had
had
but
three
hundred
de
montbas
answered
william
fiercely
ye
could
have
done
your
duty
and
if
ye
had
had
but
three
ye
could
have
done
it
and
the
vicomte
fumbled
at
the
chain
on
his
chest
i
had
no
orders
you
had
my
orders
to
defend
your
de
montbas
broke
out
desperately
before
god
i
was
misled
i
asked
for
orders
and
none
came
i
wrote
to
the
deputies
they
said
this
and
that
never
said
but
the
one
de
montbas
answered
wretchedly
your
highness
must
be
merciful
i
had
no
one
to
consult
and
after
the
fall
of
wesel
m
le
vicomte
interrupted
the
prince
sternly
the
captains
who
delivered
wesel
to
the
french
have
been
dismissed
the
army
and
their
swords
broken
over
their
your
highness
i
did
what
i
de
montbas
protested
vehemently
but
impotently
i
did
what
i
could
oh
we
waste
the
time
said
william
he
went
towards
the
entrance
what
will
your
highness
do
cried
the
vicomte
desperately
swinging
round
to
face
him
the
prince
turned
also
so
that
they
stood
but
a
foot
or
so
apart
what
i
did
with
the
garrison
of
your
highness
do
you
think
i
am
a
child
to
accept
your
excuses
asked
william
scornfully
this
is
because
i
am
the
friend
of
de
no
monsieur
it
is
because
you
are
a
traitor
prince
exclaimed
de
montbas
in
anguish
or
a
coward
added
william
unmoved
one
is
as
dangerous
as
the
other
but
i
would
rather
think
you
in
the
pay
of
france
for
it
is
unthinkable
that
you
are
the
the
frenchman
fell
into
a
shivering
agitation
before
heaven
i
am
innocent
i
have
served
the
states
faithfully
in
times
of
peace
you
insult
me
i
will
you
give
me
your
de
montbas
clapped
his
hand
to
his
weapon
you
have
not
the
right
sir
the
states
are
my
i
am
the
head
of
the
army
with
at
least
enough
power
to
punish
soldiers
who
disgrace
my
i
shall
appeal
to
de
witt
very
de
witt
hath
himself
to
look
after
his
credit
will
not
be
improved
by
your
action
this
hint
that
the
grand
pensionary
had
not
the
power
to
protect
him
completely
unnerved
de
montbas
he
had
feared
the
prince
as
much
as
he
had
always
disliked
him
and
the
sense
of
william
s
hatred
had
of
late
weighed
heavily
with
him
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
that
william
as
the
captain
general
would
dare
go
as
far
as
this
or
he
would
never
have
returned
to
the
dutch
headquarters
like
the
culmination
of
all
that
he
had
ever
dreaded
was
this
sudden
disgrace
he
found
himself
in
the
power
of
an
implacable
enemy
and
the
loss
of
his
honour
his
property
and
his
life
seemed
already
accomplished
for
his
hope
in
de
witt
suddenly
fell
away
he
stood
quite
still
with
a
tortured
expression
and
his
hand
clutched
on
his
breast
william
gave
him
an
utterly
contemptuous
glance
and
was
about
to
lift
the
tent
flap
de
montbas
flung
out
his
hand
i
entreat
your
highness
this
is
ruin
disgrace
death
his
voice
was
hoarse
and
the
blood
had
flushed
up
into
his
eyes
in
the
ill
light
of
the
lamp
and
its
confusing
shadows
the
prince
s
face
was
not
clearly
to
be
seen
but
de
montbas
had
little
hope
that
he
was
moved
sir
he
urged
desperately
consider
what
you
are
about
before
you
ruin
receiving
no
answer
to
this
but
a
cold
look
of
scorn
he
broke
out
again
you
always
hated
me
from
the
first
you
meant
to
undo
m
de
montbas
replied
william
i
opposed
your
appointment
i
opposed
the
giving
to
you
of
that
post
upon
the
rhine
had
you
been
wise
you
would
have
taken
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
you
mean
to
drive
me
to
despair
interjected
the
vicomte
i
mean
to
maintain
discipline
in
my
army
said
the
prince
and
put
his
hand
on
the
tent
flap
de
montbas
body
heaved
and
his
gay
appointments
gold
cords
and
jewels
glimmered
in
the
dusky
light
before
god
i
am
innocent
he
declared
passionately
i
am
of
the
reformed
faith
what
have
i
to
do
with
france
the
prince
regarded
him
keenly
i
am
no
traitor
he
repeated
vehemently
i
swear
it
if
that
be
not
perjury
i
am
sorry
for
you
answered
william
for
louis
is
your
king
and
it
were
better
for
you
to
serve
him
through
treachery
than
fail
us
through
the
vicomte
made
an
effort
to
control
himself
i
am
unfortunate
he
said
in
a
half
sobbing
bitterness
to
have
ever
displeased
your
highness
for
i
see
you
are
william
lifted
the
flap
blew
a
little
whistle
he
drew
from
his
pocket
and
said
something
rapidly
to
the
soldier
the
summons
brought
i
shall
appeal
to
the
grand
pensionary
cried
de
montbas
if
you
be
innocent
you
may
prove
it
without
his
help
answered
william
turning
back
into
the
tent
and
if
you
be
guilty
john
de
witt
will
not
dare
to
save
he
stopped
at
the
table
and
looked
narrowly
at
the
other
man
it
is
true
i
never
liked
you
he
said
but
if
you
had
been
one
whom
i
loved
and
had
let
the
french
across
the
rhine
and
lost
fifteen
hundred
men
i
should
now
act
the
de
montbas
winced
and
put
his
gloved
hand
to
his
lips
with
a
gesture
of
terror
your
highness
he
said
huskily
spare
me
this
and
i
will
i
will
spare
you
nothing
give
me
your
the
wretched
officer
made
a
convulsive
movement
and
dragged
his
pistol
from
his
belt
as
if
to
turn
it
on
the
prince
or
on
himself
put
that
down
said
william
scornfully
and
as
he
spoke
a
detachment
of
men
entered
the
tent
de
montbas
flung
down
his
pistol
and
stepped
back
the
prince
spoke
to
the
captain
who
had
entered
he
was
a
young
frieslander
of
the
musketeers
arrest
de
montbas
and
keep
him
under
strict
guard
monsieur
he
addressed
the
vicomte
will
you
give
your
sword
to
me
or
to
this
gentleman
the
frenchman
drew
his
weapon
and
presented
it
to
the
prince
the
states
will
see
justice
done
he
said
in
a
shaking
voice
monsieur
will
see
justice
done
answered
william
he
put
the
sword
across
the
chair
beside
him
and
turned
his
back
by
your
leave
mynheer
said
the
young
frieslander
de
montbas
submitted
in
silence
the
soldiers
saluted
the
prince
and
withdrew
their
prisoner
in
their
midst
william
looked
over
his
shoulder
at
them
and
when
they
had
gone
leant
against
the
table
in
an
exhausted
fashion
gazing
at
the
ground
he
had
not
stood
so
above
a
minute
when
william
bentinck
entered
hotly
with
a
colour
in
his
face
the
prince
gave
him
a
rather
languid
glance
highness
it
is
the
french
a
boor
has
come
running
up
to
say
they
are
advancing
to
surprise
us
i
thought
so
replied
william
it
is
de
rochfort
on
the
heels
of
de
chapter
xi
in
time
of
war
the
now
hastily
summoned
council
of
war
was
distracted
with
private
fears
and
disagreements
the
deputies
whose
opinion
had
to
be
consulted
and
with
whom
rested
the
power
of
final
decision
were
powerfully
affected
by
the
embassy
de
witt
had
just
sent
upon
its
way
to
doesburg
it
showed
they
thought
both
that
the
grand
pensionary
despaired
of
saving
the
country
by
force
of
arms
and
also
that
he
considered
an
advantageous
treaty
might
yet
be
made
with
louis
they
were
therefore
for
avoiding
a
decisive
engagement
and
suggested
that
the
army
should
retreat
the
deputy
for
zeeland
and
beverningh
influenced
by
the
prince
opposed
this
and
a
high
argument
followed
de
zuylestein
and
most
of
the
officers
of
the
prince
s
staff
were
for
fortifying
the
present
camp
and
awaiting
the
attack
of
the
enemy
william
himself
was
for
falling
back
on
utrecht
at
present
undefended
and
securing
that
against
the
advance
of
the
french
under
the
orders
of
the
states
and
much
against
the
wish
of
the
captain
general
the
forces
had
been
imprudently
divided
wurtz
had
two
thousand
seven
hundred
men
with
which
to
defend
gorcum
in
the
south
prince
john
maurice
with
ten
thousand
men
at
muyden
covered
amsterdam
the
marquis
de
louvignies
with
the
spanish
cavalry
to
the
number
of
fifteen
hundred
occupied
schoonhoven
and
count
homes
with
the
same
number
was
stationed
at
gouda
these
four
positions
were
skilfully
chosen
but
inclusive
of
the
men
sent
to
strengthen
the
garrisons
of
nymwegen
and
arnheim
they
left
the
prince
who
had
ardently
wished
to
defend
the
yssel
to
the
last
a
force
of
only
three
thousand
six
hundred
under
his
personal
control
with
these
he
could
hope
to
do
nothing
save
defend
as
he
might
the
entrance
to
holland
he
told
the
deputies
so
and
they
with
the
indecision
that
had
so
hampered
his
movements
shrugged
and
argued
and
would
not
say
what
they
would
or
would
not
do
at
length
the
prince
who
had
been
largely
silent
threatened
to
throw
up
his
commission
if
he
was
not
allowed
a
free
hand
his
position
he
declared
was
intolerable
and
he
would
be
no
man
s
puppet
de
witt
s
policy
of
controlling
the
theatre
of
war
from
a
cabinet
in
the
binnenhof
had
been
disastrous
enough
already
he
the
captain
general
was
constantly
overruled
and
disregarded
they
tied
his
hands
then
tried
to
make
him
responsible
for
actions
he
had
never
sanctioned
he
was
supported
by
de
zuylestein
and
beverningh
and
finally
the
others
dare
stand
out
no
more
two
hours
after
the
news
of
the
approach
of
the
enemy
had
been
received
orders
were
given
to
strike
camp
and
fall
back
on
utrecht
the
news
of
the
advance
of
de
rochfort
was
at
best
vague
scouts
reported
that
a
large
force
had
taken
emerloo
and
rutten
and
was
approaching
from
that
direction
the
flying
peasants
declared
the
country
from
heerde
to
vaasen
had
been
devastated
and
that
william
s
lordship
of
het
loo
was
in
the
hands
of
the
victorious
french
the
prince
seeing
that
only
the
insufficiently
defended
fortress
of
nijkerk
was
between
the
enemy
and
amersfoort
and
utrecht
made
a
détour
and
threw
his
men
along
the
banks
of
the
eem
before
amersfoort
to
whose
defences
he
had
just
seen
but
the
army
were
no
sooner
in
position
than
the
survivors
of
the
little
town
of
wijk
a
fortress
on
the
rhine
arrived
with
the
news
that
a
large
division
of
the
french
were
advancing
on
utrecht
by
that
route
an
instant
message
was
sent
to
de
louvignies
at
schoonhoven
to
defend
the
passage
of
the
river
leek
and
a
small
body
of
cavalry
was
sent
on
to
utrecht
to
encourage
the
city
with
an
assurance
of
the
prince
s
speedy
arrival
and
to
urge
them
to
see
to
their
defences
it
was
now
about
one
in
the
morning
and
further
arrivals
from
elst
schalkwyk
and
houten
confirmed
the
news
of
the
near
vicinity
of
the
enemy
it
was
said
that
louis
had
made
a
public
boast
that
he
would
take
utrecht
and
treat
with
the
commissioners
of
the
states
in
their
own
town
de
rochfort
with
a
large
detachment
of
cavalry
was
acting
as
his
advance
guard
in
clearing
the
country
from
doesburg
to
amersfoort
the
captain
general
s
entire
efforts
now
became
directed
to
saving
utrecht
the
city
was
one
of
the
largest
and
finest
in
the
netherlands
it
directly
protected
the
entrance
to
holland
and
if
it
fell
there
was
every
reason
to
suppose
that
its
loss
would
prove
as
fatal
to
that
province
as
the
capture
of
wesel
had
to
guelders
and
overyssel
both
of
which
were
now
almost
entirely
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
by
a
rapid
countermarch
which
was
much
impeded
by
a
moonless
misty
night
the
army
of
the
states
recrossed
the
eem
at
amersfoort
which
town
was
encouraged
in
its
intention
to
resist
the
enemy
by
the
addition
of
a
company
of
infantry
to
its
scanty
garrison
and
found
themselves
at
daybreak
in
the
rich
and
wooded
meadows
between
soest
and
zeyst
the
heart
of
the
fertile
and
prosperous
lands
that
comprised
the
district
of
rutten
they
were
perilously
placed
between
two
rivers
one
of
which
the
eem
had
only
amersfoort
to
defend
it
the
other
the
rhine
being
utterly
unprotected
until
reinforcements
should
arrive
from
gouda
or
schoonhoven
and
as
the
french
were
circling
round
from
the
direction
of
nijkerk
and
on
the
other
side
from
the
banks
of
the
rhine
they
indeed
seemed
with
their
hopelessly
inferior
numbers
to
be
in
a
peril
from
which
they
could
do
nothing
to
extricate
themselves
several
of
the
deputies
were
reduced
to
despair
and
were
for
putting
pressure
on
the
prince
to
abandon
utrecht
and
retreat
into
holland
towards
amsterdam
but
william
who
owed
his
present
position
to
their
cautious
policy
refused
to
listen
to
them
and
energetically
encouraging
his
officers
pressed
on
towards
the
town
of
utrecht
they
had
not
however
come
in
sight
of
the
walls
before
they
heard
the
guns
of
the
enemy
and
saw
pale
fires
in
the
early
sky
and
at
six
of
a
misty
warm
morning
they
saw
through
their
perspective
glasses
the
glittering
lines
of
the
cavalry
of
france
completely
blocking
their
progress
by
reason
of
the
flat
country
they
could
see
a
great
way
and
count
struym
who
knew
the
district
well
pointed
out
the
burning
fortress
of
zeyst
which
had
either
blown
up
or
been
fired
by
the
french
the
army
halted
and
officers
and
deputies
held
a
hasty
consultation
on
horseback
the
enemy
now
lay
between
them
and
utrecht
and
it
was
impossible
to
gain
that
town
without
a
battle
the
deputies
again
advised
a
retreat
towards
amsterdam
in
face
of
the
overwhelming
number
of
the
enemy
de
rochfort
s
force
advancing
from
nijkerk
to
conjoin
the
unfortifiable
nature
of
the
ground
it
would
be
not
a
battle
but
a
massacre
and
they
were
not
authorised
by
the
states
to
sacrifice
the
last
defenders
of
the
country
a
defeat
they
argued
would
have
a
very
ill
effect
on
the
projected
negotiations
of
de
groot
on
the
other
hand
count
struym
contended
that
a
retreat
in
face
of
the
enemy
would
result
only
in
a
pursuit
and
an
utter
rout
in
which
they
all
would
equally
perish
but
in
this
way
with
ignominy
and
disgrace
the
young
captain
general
sat
silent
on
his
grey
horse
and
looked
at
the
distant
line
of
the
french
he
was
so
well
used
to
argument
and
opposition
that
he
withheld
his
opinion
till
asked
he
had
a
great
contempt
for
words
and
the
eloquence
of
the
deputies
seemed
to
him
mere
mouthing
he
was
thinking
of
utrecht
and
wondering
what
there
was
to
be
got
out
of
his
men
he
had
only
been
head
of
the
army
a
few
weeks
but
he
had
made
a
new
thing
of
the
forces
under
his
command
throughout
a
campaign
that
had
been
a
series
of
disasters
and
retreats
his
men
had
never
lost
heart
he
had
a
way
of
maintaining
discipline
and
a
personal
popularity
that
the
veterans
did
not
possess
a
gift
of
command
that
was
worth
everything
to
an
army
pitted
against
tremendous
odds
he
turned
his
eyes
on
his
men
as
they
defiled
across
the
meadows
to
where
the
vanguard
halted
by
a
belt
of
trees
and
an
old
farm
and
windmill
and
thoughtfully
stroked
his
horse
s
neck
william
bentinck
rode
up
to
him
sir
he
cried
impatiently
if
these
lawyers
have
their
way
we
shall
be
cut
to
pieces
as
we
stand
they
are
for
a
retreat
said
the
prince
yes
it
is
neither
wise
nor
honourable
to
retreat
in
sight
of
the
enemy
remarked
the
captain
general
coldly
he
turned
his
horse
and
rode
up
to
beverningh
and
touched
him
on
the
arm
mynheer
he
said
curtly
and
decidedly
there
has
been
enough
they
all
looked
at
him
what
is
your
wish
asked
count
struym
eagerly
it
seems
to
me
highness
we
have
no
course
open
but
to
there
is
utrecht
answered
the
prince
i
mean
to
save
the
deputies
were
silent
they
wished
above
all
things
to
avoid
responsibility
william
eyed
them
he
saw
perfectly
well
that
they
would
neither
sanction
nor
veto
his
plans
and
that
whatever
course
he
took
they
would
blame
him
if
it
proved
disastrous
and
take
the
credit
if
it
ended
in
success
divided
authority
placed
both
sides
in
a
difficult
position
but
if
the
deputies
hesitated
the
captain
general
s
decision
was
prompt
and
unshakable
his
scheme
was
to
remain
and
face
the
french
with
three
regiments
of
cavalry
thereby
distracting
them
from
utrecht
which
town
count
struym
with
the
rest
of
the
army
of
the
states
was
to
reach
in
a
détour
by
way
of
maartensdyk
and
maarsen
it
was
hoped
that
before
midday
reinforcements
would
arrive
from
schoonhoven
and
gouda
these
attacking
the
rear
of
the
enemy
would
enable
the
prince
to
withdraw
the
rest
of
his
army
along
the
road
to
utrecht
which
count
struym
must
keep
open
and
throw
himself
into
that
town
before
the
french
bombarded
the
fortifications
if
these
tactics
savoured
of
desperation
the
situation
was
such
as
called
for
desperate
expedients
and
no
one
dared
withstand
them
some
encouragement
was
afforded
by
the
fact
that
the
rising
ground
would
disguise
from
the
enemy
that
the
stand
the
dutch
offered
covered
the
retreat
of
the
greater
portion
of
their
forces
and
it
was
reasonably
hoped
that
the
french
would
not
suspect
that
any
attempt
was
being
made
to
save
utrecht
at
seven
count
struym
drew
off
with
the
bulk
of
the
army
and
the
larger
number
of
the
deputies
beverningh
however
remained
with
the
prince
who
relieved
from
supervision
and
control
was
energetically
disposing
his
little
force
to
the
best
advantage
since
they
had
broken
camp
they
had
been
swelled
by
the
survivors
of
the
garrisons
of
the
rhine
fortresses
large
numbers
of
peasants
and
de
montbas
company
of
cavalry
which
had
been
put
under
the
command
of
bentinck
in
all
they
numbered
about
two
thousand
men
of
which
fourteen
hundred
were
cavalry
they
had
been
marching
and
all
night
and
some
were
mere
fugitives
without
as
much
as
a
musket
they
were
weary
and
had
every
excuse
for
discouragement
since
neither
the
number
of
the
enemy
nor
the
peace
proposals
of
de
witt
which
all
took
for
an
indication
of
despair
on
that
statesman
s
part
could
be
disguised
from
them
to
add
to
their
discomfort
the
baggage
waggons
had
not
been
able
to
keep
pace
with
the
rapid
movements
of
the
army
and
there
was
not
so
much
as
a
loaf
of
bread
among
them
the
mill
and
adjacent
farms
were
found
to
be
deserted
all
the
surrounding
having
retreated
into
utrecht
and
the
hopes
of
food
from
these
were
dispelled
the
men
were
mostly
unmoved
their
officers
and
the
prince
himself
were
as
badly
off
as
themselves
they
would
sooner
fight
than
retreat
they
had
a
way
of
doing
both
quietly
william
rode
among
the
companies
and
his
quick
observation
detected
no
discontent
many
of
the
men
sang
psalms
as
they
brought
up
the
guns
and
there
were
weighty
arguments
on
points
of
doctrine
between
arminians
and
calvinists
latter
day
saints
and
knipperdollings
for
these
people
the
most
obstinate
and
unconvincible
in
the
world
found
one
of
their
keenest
pleasures
in
logic
and
argument
william
s
appearance
woke
their
deep
and
sincere
enthusiasm
he
spoke
to
them
with
more
animation
than
bentinck
had
ever
known
him
show
promised
the
cavalry
who
were
doing
the
work
of
foot
soldiers
double
pay
and
the
peasants
who
were
digging
trenches
and
erecting
palisades
a
florin
a
day
while
they
stuck
to
their
work
he
heartened
them
with
a
promise
of
rest
and
food
in
utrecht
before
night
and
entreated
them
to
stand
firm
in
defence
of
their
religion
and
their
liberty
his
resolution
and
his
energy
did
not
fail
of
its
effect
they
forgot
fatigue
the
number
and
prestige
of
the
enemy
their
own
former
disasters
and
set
themselves
cheerfully
in
readiness
but
if
the
men
were
encouraged
by
the
prince
s
inspection
he
himself
was
not
everything
was
lacking
ammunition
guns
even
shoes
and
coats
a
considerable
number
of
the
cavalry
were
on
foot
for
want
of
horses
and
two
culverins
had
had
to
be
abandoned
for
lack
of
william
thought
bitterly
of
de
witt
the
grand
pensionary
had
answered
his
appeal
in
eager
and
affectionate
terms
but
neither
levies
nor
supplies
had
arrived
de
witt
seemed
more
desirous
to
send
de
groot
on
a
mission
of
peace
than
to
strengthen
the
army
and
the
new
captain
general
was
left
with
miserably
inadequate
means
m
beverningh
said
william
this
is
my
first
experience
of
war
and
i
do
not
think
any
one
ever
fell
into
a
harder
and
the
coming
encounter
was
his
first
experience
of
actual
battle
he
had
been
a
fortnight
with
the
army
but
had
heard
no
more
than
the
distant
sound
of
the
french
guns
he
had
witnessed
no
engagement
yet
perhaps
beverningh
was
the
only
man
to
whom
it
occurred
as
an
anomaly
that
a
youth
of
who
only
knew
war
from
books
and
had
never
seen
bloodshed
should
be
commanding
an
army
in
such
desperate
straits
against
a
foe
led
by
the
most
famous
soldiers
in
the
world
every
one
else
seemed
as
unconscious
as
was
the
prince
himself
if
he
lacked
experience
he
had
certainly
rare
qualities
but
beverningh
was
curious
as
to
his
behaviour
in
the
actual
shock
of
battle
in
the
actual
moment
of
leading
his
men
to
the
encounter
the
infantry
was
placed
behind
the
hastily
constructed
earthworks
and
in
the
mill
and
farm
buildings
which
were
taken
as
the
nucleus
of
the
defence
the
french
were
an
unaccountable
time
in
advancing
seemed
if
anything
to
be
hanging
back
the
truth
was
their
commander
had
no
wish
for
an
encounter
with
the
prince
of
orange
against
whom
his
master
had
no
quarrel
and
whose
interests
louis
had
agreed
to
respect
his
intention
was
to
take
utrecht
and
he
thought
that
given
a
little
time
william
would
have
the
tact
to
withdraw
and
leave
the
road
open
to
him
as
de
montbas
had
done
at
the
rhine
but
about
ten
o
clock
perceiving
as
he
thought
the
entire
dutch
forces
still
immovable
before
their
protection
of
trees
and
rising
ground
he
advanced
to
the
attack
after
expressing
to
his
officers
his
regret
that
his
majesty
s
cousin
had
given
them
the
unnecessary
trouble
of
beating
him
he
had
under
his
command
seven
or
eight
thousand
men
well
fed
well
drilled
a
fine
corps
of
artillery
and
two
of
the
most
renowned
cavalry
regiments
of
france
he
was
further
strengthened
by
the
knowledge
of
de
rochfort
s
advance
from
nijkerk
and
near
approach
of
the
king
himself
who
was
reported
to
have
already
left
doesburg
with
the
household
brigade
a
conquered
country
behind
his
banners
through
the
thick
sweet
hazy
air
came
at
last
the
sound
of
the
french
drums
and
trumpets
and
as
it
was
quite
windless
their
colours
and
banners
were
all
displayed
above
them
as
they
marched
they
had
left
their
baggage
waggons
and
some
of
their
artillery
under
the
guard
of
the
infantry
in
the
rear
for
they
did
not
regard
the
coming
engagement
as
one
likely
long
to
impede
their
progress
and
at
an
easy
pace
their
magnificent
cavalry
advanced
across
the
flat
meadows
to
the
little
wood
of
elm
and
beech
where
the
birds
were
singing
among
the
warm
leaves
and
the
dutch
waited
the
sun
bathed
them
in
an
even
glow
red
and
blue
coats
gold
and
silver
trappings
gleamed
as
the
men
and
horses
moved
from
the
distance
even
they
had
an
extraordinarily
easy
demeanour
as
if
they
laughed
amongst
themselves
soon
it
became
possible
to
distinguish
the
soft
tramp
of
the
horses
the
jingle
of
the
harness
and
the
rumbling
of
the
guns
shaking
on
their
carriages
the
dutch
trumpets
made
answer
now
and
as
the
french
came
within
range
their
guns
opened
fire
tearing
the
summer
peace
into
fury
and
as
the
smoke
curled
away
the
cavalry
of
the
states
galloped
out
of
the
wood
in
little
companies
colours
flying
and
slack
reins
the
prince
of
orange
count
königsmarck
and
william
of
aylva
were
together
on
a
little
incline
watching
the
enemy
who
are
they
asked
the
prince
of
the
german
who
had
travelled
much
in
france
regiments
of
the
line
highness
dragoons
and
in
the
centre
one
of
the
household
he
raised
his
perspective
glass
yes
the
company
under
the
prince
de
soubise
i
can
see
the
william
said
nothing
he
turned
and
galloped
to
the
centre
of
the
line
of
guns
just
beneath
the
mill
the
french
assuming
the
netherlanders
would
have
remained
under
cover
if
their
numbers
were
weak
took
the
daring
charge
of
the
cavalry
as
a
sign
that
their
entire
force
was
concealed
by
the
rising
ground
this
was
the
impression
the
prince
had
hoped
to
create
instantly
the
french
wishing
to
draw
their
enemy
into
the
open
and
to
put
themselves
beyond
the
range
of
the
guns
retreated
with
a
skilful
backward
movement
steady
and
swift
as
the
reflux
of
a
wave
then
the
foremost
company
of
cavalry
regardless
of
the
empty
saddles
already
made
divided
wheeled
to
left
and
right
met
again
and
charged
this
was
the
french
mode
reckless
showy
expensive
but
irresistible
at
once
the
glory
and
the
ruin
of
their
arms
it
exposed
the
very
flower
of
their
youth
gallantry
and
nobility
to
the
whole
brunt
of
the
battle
while
the
infantry
remained
comparatively
immune
again
and
again
the
french
were
to
buy
dashing
and
profitless
victories
at
the
price
of
their
best
blood
again
and
again
the
aristocrats
and
gentlemen
were
to
be
sacrificed
in
cruel
slaughter
until
all
the
finest
lives
in
france
were
hurled
away
in
pursuance
of
the
reckless
policy
of
the
cavalry
charge
of
the
household
troops
so
now
they
came
on
reins
hanging
loose
the
horses
with
lengthened
necks
flattened
ears
and
staring
eyes
ribbons
feathers
laces
and
curls
blowing
back
over
the
shoulders
of
the
men
the
dutch
formed
close
and
received
the
shock
of
the
onset
without
flinching
there
was
a
short
struggle
then
the
french
withdrew
at
the
gallop
wheeled
and
charged
the
dutch
backed
before
them
and
as
they
swept
to
the
foot
of
the
wood
a
volley
from
the
guns
their
cavalry
had
galloped
aside
to
make
way
for
sent
back
half
the
horses
riderless
the
french
were
too
well
trained
to
show
confusion
this
was
a
fiercer
defence
however
than
they
had
expected
de
soubise
hurled
forward
two
more
companies
and
himself
advanced
with
his
own
light
horse
this
fresh
and
hot
onslaught
almost
overpowered
the
dutch
horse
they
were
driven
back
almost
to
the
mouths
of
their
own
guns
the
prince
sent
out
the
spanish
cavalry
to
the
rescue
and
placed
a
regiment
of
foot
behind
the
gunners
where
they
could
pick
off
the
french
cavalry
from
the
cover
of
the
trees
de
soubise
unable
to
make
much
use
of
his
artillery
had
thrown
out
his
left
wing
composed
of
brigadiers
and
guns
in
a
half
circle
to
attempt
to
storm
the
wood
where
the
ground
was
flat
and
a
small
cottage
the
only
vantage
spot
william
perceiving
this
sent
bentinck
to
the
assistance
of
the
officer
occupying
the
cottage
and
himself
rode
up
to
d
aylva
who
was
commanding
the
troops
held
in
reserve
the
french
are
magnificent
he
said
but
our
men
fight
very
he
was
flushed
and
excited
his
eyes
dark
and
wide
open
all
the
restraint
had
gone
from
his
voice
and
there
was
a
new
eagerness
in
his
expression
the
older
man
at
this
irrelevant
moment
found
himself
remembering
that
his
general
was
a
boy
who
had
never
seen
battle
before
himself
a
famous
soldier
who
had
been
named
a
second
mars
he
looked
critically
at
the
prince
m
de
soubise
has
every
advantage
he
said
but
we
can
keep
him
at
bay
till
nightfall
replied
william
when
we
can
gain
do
you
think
so
highness
the
prince
turned
on
him
the
candid
look
of
youth
yes
he
said
simply
the
air
about
them
hung
dun
and
heavy
with
smoke
between
the
trees
the
whizz
and
thud
of
bullets
striking
the
trunks
the
hoarse
deafening
boom
of
the
cannon
the
nearer
sound
of
striking
tinder
transformed
the
sweet
stillness
of
the
morning
into
the
lurid
tumult
of
war
your
highness
is
in
some
danger
here
said
d
aylva
if
you
would
withdraw
nearer
the
mill
william
smiled
and
rode
out
of
the
trees
on
to
the
little
clearing
beside
the
guns
the
battle
beat
fiercely
to
and
fro
in
the
green
meadows
de
soubise
had
turned
his
attention
to
the
position
held
by
bentinck
s
untaught
valour
and
at
the
foot
of
the
wood
the
dutch
and
french
struggled
desperately
together
the
prince
s
keen
glance
swept
over
the
field
a
fell
beside
him
and
exploded
frightening
his
horse
into
rearing
frantically
he
kept
his
seat
and
quieted
the
animal
wiping
the
foam
from
its
face
with
his
lace
handkerchief
just
beneath
him
a
dutch
company
had
been
repulsed
by
the
enemy
nearly
all
the
officers
had
fallen
and
the
men
left
leaderless
were
retreating
in
a
confusion
the
prince
galloped
down
the
incline
and
to
the
head
of
the
disheartened
company
they
were
men
of
his
own
province
part
of
a
holland
regiment
gentlemen
he
said
drawing
his
sword
will
you
have
me
for
your
leader
he
was
still
smiling
it
is
the
prince
they
cried
he
lifted
his
sword
and
led
them
straight
against
the
french
dragoons
they
fought
now
with
a
mad
passion
that
was
not
to
be
the
french
gave
way
inch
by
inch
and
eventually
retreated
to
the
main
body
without
a
moment
s
pause
the
prince
shouting
to
the
spanish
cavalry
to
join
him
dashed
round
to
the
aid
of
bentinck
who
was
being
overpowered
by
sheer
numbers
time
after
time
his
little
band
was
driven
back
time
after
time
he
led
them
again
to
the
charge
the
french
themselves
were
amazed
at
this
undaunted
persistence
more
than
once
their
ranks
were
broken
and
when
count
königsmarck
came
with
a
guelderland
regiment
to
the
support
of
his
master
they
abandoned
their
attack
on
the
cottage
after
a
fight
lasting
two
hours
the
sun
was
now
high
overhead
and
the
strong
rays
drove
even
through
the
choking
smoke
and
glared
on
the
armour
of
the
combatants
the
air
was
hot
dry
and
close
with
the
smell
of
blood
and
powder
the
leaves
but
a
few
hours
ago
so
fresh
hung
withered
and
burnt
along
the
lower
branches
and
some
of
the
neat
painted
of
the
farm
were
burning
steadily
with
pale
flames
and
black
smoke
rank
after
rank
line
after
line
the
french
cavalry
rode
up
and
the
right
wing
of
the
dutch
began
to
give
way
the
prince
extricated
himself
from
the
confusion
round
the
rescued
outpost
and
rode
with
bentinck
to
his
retreating
men
they
had
lost
all
their
officers
save
one
young
ensign
a
friesland
giant
with
bright
gold
hair
who
seemed
dazed
not
knowing
what
to
do
he
fought
like
one
in
a
dream
aimlessly
the
red
blood
drying
on
his
cuirass
william
dismounted
throwing
his
reins
to
bentinck
that
is
not
the
way
he
cried
you
must
put
more
fire
in
it
he
placed
himself
at
their
head
and
led
them
against
the
musketeers
the
young
officer
stared
at
him
bewildered
mynheer
cried
the
prince
second
me
now
and
i
will
give
you
this
company
the
frieslander
roused
himself
and
shouted
a
word
of
command
the
dutch
stood
firm
then
hurled
themselves
against
the
enemy
twice
they
were
repulsed
by
the
superior
force
twice
the
prince
led
them
back
till
the
trampled
grass
grew
so
choked
with
dead
that
the
living
were
divided
by
the
slain
william
of
aylva
surveyed
the
battle
from
the
top
of
the
incline
does
the
prince
want
to
meet
his
death
he
muttered
then
what
is
this
but
madness
and
he
looked
at
the
army
of
france
that
rolled
almost
as
far
as
the
horizon
and
though
he
was
a
brave
man
his
counsels
were
for
a
flight
saving
such
lives
as
they
could
he
saw
the
prince
remounted
on
the
grey
horse
emerge
from
the
smoky
tumult
and
he
rode
down
to
meet
him
highness
he
caught
the
young
man
s
bridle
this
is
madness
william
answered
no
it
is
my
duty
where
are
these
men
if
i
do
not
hearten
them
if
you
are
slain
where
are
our
hopes
the
prince
laughed
i
shall
not
be
slain
as
he
spoke
a
bullet
glanced
along
his
cuirass
carrying
away
the
knot
of
his
black
scarf
we
can
not
do
it
said
d
aylva
will
not
your
highness
order
a
retreat
not
yet
not
yet
answered
the
prince
passionately
he
looked
round
at
the
broken
battalions
only
his
unconquerable
energy
had
kept
together
so
long
they
need
encouragement
he
exclaimed
they
dare
not
stand
up
to
such
veteran
troops
yet
it
could
be
done
if
every
man
had
your
spirit
muttered
william
d
aylva
again
looking
at
him
curiously
i
believe
it
the
prince
gathered
together
the
last
of
the
cavalry
and
rode
back
into
the
hottest
part
of
the
battle
william
d
aylva
though
with
no
hope
led
the
reserve
regiment
of
guelderlanders
into
action
nearly
all
the
dutch
artillery
was
useless
some
of
the
guns
were
spiked
others
had
lost
their
gunners
and
there
was
little
powder
left
the
right
wing
of
the
holland
regiments
was
utterly
cut
to
pieces
bentinck
coming
too
late
to
the
rescue
could
bring
off
no
more
than
the
colours
and
one
tattered
detachment
still
the
centre
and
the
left
fought
on
the
captain
general
found
himself
separated
from
his
men
he
galloped
to
the
spanish
cavalry
where
he
had
stationed
it
to
defend
the
entrance
to
the
wood
close
to
the
rescued
cottage
he
met
a
band
of
men
who
were
doing
nothing
he
drew
up
his
horse
and
turned
in
the
saddle
why
do
you
not
charge
he
asked
in
french
thinking
they
were
the
spanish
who
used
that
language
the
leader
answered
civilly
that
they
had
no
powder
and
even
as
he
spoke
william
saw
that
they
were
french
he
was
entirely
in
their
power
his
pride
did
not
permit
him
to
fly
he
backed
his
horse
good
he
said
i
will
send
you
some
utterly
unconscious
they
let
him
go
taking
him
for
a
french
officer
not
in
the
least
impressed
by
what
his
temerity
had
exposed
him
to
william
gazed
round
fiercely
for
the
spanish
who
had
apparently
forsaken
their
post
suddenly
he
saw
a
detachment
of
them
riding
through
the
underwood
but
riding
away
from
the
battle
pale
with
rage
he
spurred
up
to
them
what
is
this
he
asked
them
i
think
you
should
have
your
faces
to
the
enemy
they
had
a
look
about
them
such
as
is
seldom
seen
in
men
sometimes
in
a
horse
before
it
shies
it
is
a
massacre
out
there
carnage
answered
one
through
his
teeth
the
day
is
lost
i
ll
shoot
the
man
who
says
so
exclaimed
the
prince
putting
his
hand
to
his
holster
get
back
to
your
places
you
cowards
and
never
care
whether
the
day
be
lost
or
no
as
long
as
you
stay
where
you
are
they
cowered
before
him
and
he
in
his
wrath
turned
the
officer
s
horse
himself
and
when
the
man
still
hesitated
he
took
his
whip
from
his
boot
and
lashed
them
back
into
the
it
was
now
nearly
dusk
and
as
the
sun
struck
level
rays
across
the
battlefield
before
it
sunk
below
the
flat
horizon
the
sound
of
the
marquis
de
rochfort
s
guns
was
heard
in
the
distance
no
human
endeavour
could
do
any
more
the
prince
had
kept
up
a
fight
of
eight
hours
against
overwhelming
odds
holding
at
bay
with
his
raw
tired
troops
the
splendid
forces
of
france
more
than
half
his
army
was
slain
his
guns
were
dismounted
his
powder
spent
reluctantly
he
drew
off
his
exhausted
men
first
firing
the
mill
and
the
farmhouses
to
impede
the
enemy
in
the
pursuit
which
they
were
however
by
no
means
inclined
to
make
de
soubise
was
quite
satisfied
with
his
victory
and
it
was
no
part
of
the
training
of
his
school
of
warfare
to
follow
up
a
success
he
still
imagined
the
dutch
to
have
been
at
least
twice
their
number
and
consequently
magnified
his
own
glory
his
men
were
tired
and
with
the
dark
great

blew
up

fell
the

the

repeated
that

when
they
were
within
a

miles
of

a

band
of

bearing
lanterns
came
to
meet
them
de

with

news

seized

closed

chapter
xii
after
the
defeat
in
a
little
farm
abandoned
by
its
owner
the
prince
and
his
staff
found
shelter
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
until
dawn
at
least
since
utrecht
had
closed
her
gates
the
bitterness
of
this
disappointment
was
unbearable
the
long
day
s
struggle
had
had
solely
this
end
in
view
to
save
utrecht
the
men
were
worn
out
hungry
wet
disheartened
only
the
firmest
discipline
prevented
a
mutiny
or
a
panic
two
of
the
baggage
waggons
had
come
up
with
them
in
one
there
was
nothing
but
jerome
beverningh
s
camp
furniture
anger
and
derision
were
roused
the
deputy
had
brought
with
him
such
things
as
velvet
chairs
and
crystal
candlesticks
the
last
broken
in
the
rough
transit
the
second
waggon
contained
food
this
was
dealt
out
to
the
wounded
de
zuylestein

who
had
spent
the
day
outside
the
walls
of
utrecht
while
their
leader
argued
desperately
with
the
magistrates
were
fresher
and
had
ravaged
some
provisions
from
the
neighbouring
farms
but
the
bulk
of
the
men
had
been
without
food
twelve
hours
or
more
they
attempted
to
set
up
such
tents
as
they
had
with
them
but
a
strong
wind
rising
when
the
rain
ceased
hurled
poles
and
canvas
to
the
ground
and
scattered
the
in
handfuls
of
sparks
no
news
reached
them
of
either
de
louvignies
or
count
hornes
but
a
messenger
got
through
the
enemy
s
lines
with
a
desperate
appeal
from
prince
john
maurice
at
muyden
where
the
starved
troops
were
in
a
state
of
mutiny
and
threatening
to
desert

the
french
do
not
be
surprised
his
letter
to
the

concluded
if
your
next
news
is
that
we
have
all
been
cut
to
and
muyden
was
the
key
to

the

said
nothing
to
this
he
said
nothing
when
he
heard
that
traitors
had
possession
of
utrecht
though
he
had
fought
desperately
for
a
day
to
save
the
city
his
containment
now
was
as
marked
as
had
been
his
fervour
and
ardour
in
the
battle
count
königsmarck
came
to
tell
him
that
a
young
frieslander
of
a
republican
family
claimed
the

of

surviving
companies
and
that
it
was
against

his

on
fine
tumbled
sheets
and
in
the
was
a
bed
the
blue
curtains
drawn
there
lay
matthew
bromley
hidden
in
shadow
save
for
his
feet
over
which
the
fell
making
his
silver
buckles
glimmer
he
was
dying
a
heat
that
seemed
to
have
substance
so
oppressive
it
was
filled
the
two
rooms
the
window
was
wide
open
but
no
relief
came
from
the
hot
and
heavy
wind
that
blew
in
suddenly
the
prince
rose
and
came
to
the
table
he
wore
no
hat
and
his
long
hair
was
tied
back
with
a
black
ribbon
taken
from
the
ruffles
in
his
sleeve
his
face
was
absolutely
without
colour
his
lids
drooping
he
had
been
hours
in
the
saddle
and
without
food
he
held
himself
with
an
air
of
unutterable
weariness
his
cuirass
was
stained
with
blood
and
rusted
with
the
rain
his
cravat
undone
his
scarf
and
sash
shot
and
slashed
to
rags
his
right
arm
was
cut
and
he
had
rent
away
part
of
his
full
sleeve
to
tie
it
up
with
the
tattered
laces
and
ribbons
hung
down
over
his
hand
his
boots
and
spurs
were
caked
with
mud
he
held
his
heavy
sword
from
the
floor
and
as
he
reached
the
table
unstrapped
it
and
laid
sword
and
baldric
across
a
chair
he
looked
at
beverningh
at
his
uncle
zuylestein
neither
said
anything
slowly
he
went
over
to
bentinck
how
is
bromley
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
the
same
it
can
not
last
is
there
no
surgeon
to
be
found
bentinck
shrugged
his
shoulders
we
had
but
and
they
dead
or
and
the
clergymen
there
are
three
going
about
among
the
wounded
but
matthew
bromley
is
not
a
i
had
bentinck
rose
from
his
knees
his
splendid
dress
was
soiled
and
tarnished
his
bright
good
looks
marred
by
fatigue
i
am
thinking
of
your
i
am
very
well
but
i
am
sorry
for
matthew
he
is
not
the
only
the
cause
was
not
his
answered
the
prince
wearily
and
he
is
a
man
who
loves
his
with
that
he
took
one
of
the
candles
and
went
softly
into
the
inner
room
where
his
gentleman
lay
the
bed
was
set
in
the
wall
and
could
be
concealed
by
drawing
a
sliding
panel
it
was
fragrantly
clean
but
dark
and
close
the
englishman
s
head
was
propped
up
on
two
pillows
the
upper
part
of
him
concealed
in
shadow
his
coat
had
been
removed
and
his
wound
dressed
by
william
bentinck
s
unskilled
care
the
blood
had
soaked
through
the
linen
swathings
and
stained
the
neat
flowered
coverlet
william
approached
shading
the
candle
with
his
hand
how
does
it
go
with
you
he
asked
matthew
bromley
moved
his
head
restlessly
how
hot
it
is
he
murmured
then
i
would
they
did
not
build
their
beds
in
their
walls
here
we
could
do
no
better
answered
the
prince
gently
who
is
it
came
faintly
i
william
of
bromley
made
a
little
sound
of
pleasure
ah
your
highness
the
prince
set
the
candle
on
the
chair
behind
him
i
am
sorry
to
see
you
like
this
bromley
he
said
the
englishman
s
voice
came
faintly
from
the
pillow
no
matter
for
me
but
it
has
been
a
disastrous
the
prince
held
back
the
curtain
it
was
no
quarrel
of
yours
my
poor
fellow
he
answered
matthew
bromley
smiled
his
careless
face
had
changed
into
a
look
of
bewildered
grieving
you
had
better
have
gone
home
said
william
gently
it
was
against
the
he
closed
his
eyes
and
made
an
effort
with
his
strength
i
am
sorry
we
were
that
may
be
but
nothing
can
mend
me
ah
he
spoke
in
an
absent
and
regretful
voice
they
could
hear
the
warm
wind
without
and
the
groanings
of
the
wounded
who
lay
in
the
outhouses
tell
me
what
i
can
do
asked
the
prince
the
blue
eyes
opened
vacantly
your
family
yes
ah

will
write
to
them
in
england

there
anything
i
should
say

william
bent
lower

the
dying
man
answered
in
english
that
balsam
my
mother
what
is
it
you
say
she
never
told
me
how
to
use
he
smiled
aimlessly
william
was
silent
how
they
fought
there
was
only
one
tongue
for
him
now
william
spoke
in
his
careful
english
i
shall
miss
you
ah
i
understand
you
the
prince
smoothed
his
pillow
don
t
trouble
the
englishman
moved
his
head
restlessly
it
isn
t
worth
while
i
would
give
a
deal
to

hot

he
seemed
to
be
wandering
in
the
summer
time
it
was
pleasant
harry
is
at
oxford
the
prince
turned
away
and
picked
up
the
candle
william
he
called
softly
bentinck
came
to
the
door
have
we
nothing
asked
the
prince
m
beverningh
has
discovered
a
bottle
of
beer
in
the
cupboard
and

he
but
for
bromley
i
bentinck
fetched
a
glass
of
the
boiled
wine
and
handed
it
to
the
prince
we
have
nothing
william
made
no
reply
you
had
best
take
some
sir
and
the
bread
too
is
not
so
the
prince
gave
the
stuff
a
sick
look
get
me
some
water
he
said
putting
it
down
well
answered
bentinck
with
a
grim
smile
m
de
zuylestein
and
beverningh
are
making
a
the
prince
returned
to
the
bed
and
in
a
while
bentinck
brought
the
water
in
a
dull
green
glass
matthew
bromley
stared
up
at
them
am
i
dying
he
asked
abruptly
he
took
the
water
drank
with
avidity
then
murmured
i
must
write
bentinck
left
the
room
the
heat
seemed
to
increase
some
one
was
reciting
a
psalm
outside
in
a
gabbling
voice
another
groaned
bitterly
the
swinging
lamp
was
going
out
with
a
harsh
stench
of
oil
the
prince
crossed
the
room
to
quench
it
as
he
moved
bromley
called
out
rapidly
i
was
shot
through
the
lungs
in
my
first
engagement
i
died
in
a
cottage
outside
utrecht
i
was
shot
through
the
lungs
i
am
writing
to
he
suddenly
laughed
i
am
glad
i
saw
those
french
players
before
i
left
the
i
shall
never
get
another
william
had
turned
out
the
lamp
they
were
left
with
only
the
light
of
the
tallow
candle
on
the
mantelpiece
the
prince
came
back
to
his
gentleman
who
lay
in
a
half
stupor
pulling
at
his
coverlet
with
clumsy
fingers
bromley
his
young
master
bent
over
him
you
are
i
must
tell
we
have
no
clergyman
but
you
could
pray
no
calvinist
muttered
bromley
god
said
the
prince
vehemently
knows
no
bromley
gave
a
little
sigh
as
if
his
mind
had
suddenly
cleared
is
not
your
highness
in
despair
he
asked
weakly
why
because
the
french
beat
us
and
there
seems
no
hope
for
how
can
i
despair
answered
the
young
general
god
has
me
by
the
the
dying
man
glanced
at
him
sharply
and
curiously
does
your
highness
believe
like
that
william
smiled
could
i
live
if
i
did
not
believe
matthew
bromley
s
blue
eyes
were
still
fixed
on
him
intently
i
never
thought
of
it
much
but
i
detain
your
highness
no
no
there
is
nothing
i
can
do
till
the
in
my
coat
his
voice
failed
yes
there
is
a
book
a
i
will
get
if
your
highness
could
read
it
in
william
pressed
his
hand
the
wind
struggled
in
the
great
barns
outside
and
the
coarse
yellow
flame
shuddered
in
the
hot
air
from
the
high
window
in
the
kitchen
could
be
seen
zuylestein
asleep
on
the
settle
and
beverningh
at
the
table
sipping
his
boiled
wine
there
are
some
papers
too
whispered
bromley
and
bills
burn
them
they
are
so
the
prince
turned
over
the
stained
and
bloody
coat
and
found
the
anglican
i
wonder
why
i
brought
it
said
the
englishman
vaguely
william
seated
himself
beside
the
bed
and
began
turning
over
the
unfamiliar
leaves
the
prayer
for
the
departing
murmured
matthew
bromley
the
prince
put
his
hand
to
his
forehead
his
head
was
so
heavy
that
he
could
hardly
hold
it
up
and
the
scanty
light
scarcely
permitted
him
to
read
the
foreign
print
matthew
bromley
closed
his
eyes
william
had
never
looked
on
death
before
but
he
did
not
fail
to
mark
that
it
was
very
near
what
shall
i
read
he
asked
for
the
bromley
moaned
a
little
the
prince
found
the
place
his
tired
but
fervent
voice
came
through
the
distraction
of
other
sounds
almighty
god
with
whom
do
live
the
spirits
of
just
men
made
perfect
after
they
are
delivered
from
their
earthly
prisons
we
humbly
commend
the
soul
of
this
thy
servant
our
dear
brother
into
thy
hands
into
thy
hands
whispered
bromley
as
into
the
hands
of
a
faithful
creator
and
most
merciful
saviour
most
humbly
beseeching
thee
that
it
may
be
precious
in
thy
sight
the
wind
and
the
restless
complainings
without
were
unceasing
bromley
clasped
his
hands
on
his
breast
the
prince
read
on
carefully
and
teach
us
who
survive
in
this
and
like
daily
spectacles
of
mortality
to
see
how
frail
and
uncertain
our
own
condition
is
and
so
to
number
our
days
that
we
may
seriously
apply
our
hearts
to
that
holy
and
heavenly
wisdom
whilst
we
live
i
read
so
ill
my
poor
english
murmured
the
prince
no
i
which
may
in
the
end
bring
us
to
life
everlasting
through
the
merits
of
jesus
christ
our
lord
matthew
bromley
s
life
was
sinking
fast
like
a
sea
receding
was
the
blue
light
in
his
eyes
each
second
farther
away
william
went
on
his
knees
by
the
aperture
of
the
bed
in
thee
lord
have
i
put
my
trust
let
me
never
be
put
to
confusion
but
rid
me
and
deliver
me
in
thy
righteousness
incline
thine
ear
unto
me
and
save
me
bromley
stretched
out
his
cold
pale
hand
i
thank
your
do
not
think
of
me
but
of
the
two
young
men
both
so
white
so
haggard
so
dishevelled
that
the
one
drawing
his
last
breath
was
hardly
to
be
told
from
him
who
comforted
clasped
hands
in
the
hot
shadows
of
the
peasant
s
bed
bromley
made
a
movement
as
if
to
draw
the
prince
towards
him
i
would
i
had
lived
to
see
your
highness
fortunate
he
breathed
then
god
god
he
is
very
with
that
he
sighed
three
times
and
died
with
the
gentlest
stilling
of
his
breath
the
prince
drew
back
a
little
then
lifted
bromley
s
hands
and
crossed
them
on
his
breast
death
had
come
so
softly
the
pillow
and
coverlet
were
not
disturbed
by
unavailing
struggles
nor
was
matthew
bromley
he
looked
at
rest
the
prince
pulled
the
curtain
and
went
to
the
stained
velvet
coat
hanging
over
the
chair
in
the
pockets
were
letters
charms
and
a
full
of
gold
pieces
william
burnt
the
papers
without
reading
them
and
left
the
money
and
the
on
the
chair
then
he
the
kitchen
bentinck
was
smoking
a
short
clay
matthew
bromley
is
dead
said
the
prince
poor
soul
answered
william
bentinck
beverningh
was
silent
and
de
zuylestein
asleep
the
prince
went
to
the
window
coughing
bentinck
guiltily
knocked
out
his
pipe
what
will
you
do
he
asked
get
into
utrecht
said
the
captain
general
briefly
beverningh
looked
up
if
they
will
not
defend
the
place
they
shall
at
least
provision
us
added
the
prince
now
beverningh
spoke
they
will
refuse
us
admission
it
is
my
will
and
purpose
to
enter
utrecht
answered
william
meanwhile
bentinck
began
when
the
door
was
flung
open
and
a
young
officer
entered
your
highness
he
was
agitated
breathing
hard
and
carried
a
pistol
william
came
forward
out
of
the
shadows
what
is
it
the
friesland
regiments
sir
they
mutiny
i
know
not
what
to
bentinck
rose
and
softly
latched
the
swinging
door
why
do
they
mutiny
asked
the
prince
sir
they
say
they
are
starving
and
that
it
is
but
waiting
here
to
be
cut
to
pieces
and
that
the
country
is
lost
and
that
they
will
submit
to
the
king
of
france
and
go
back
to
their
homes
you
speak
as
if
not
over
confident
yourself
mynheer
said
william
holding
up
his
head
truly
your
highness
affairs
are
if
we
despair
they
are
desperate
indeed
replied
the
captain
general
sternly
it
is
our
duty
mynheer
not
to
but
these
men
asked
beverningh
i
will
go
and
speak
to
them
said
the
prince
quietly
your
highness
has
done
enough
protested
william
bentinck
i
do
what
it
would
seem
there
is
no
one
else
to
do
was
the
answer
he
picked
up
his
cloak
from
the
and
flung
it
over
his
tattered
uniform
have
you
no
lantern
he
asked
the
officer
sir
the
moon
is
bentinck
with
an
impatient
look
at
zuylestein
who
was
still
very
contentedly
asleep
made
ready
to
accompany
the
prince
and
the
three
started
out
through
the
encampment
the
wind
had
dropped
sweeping
away
the
clouds
with
it
and
a
full
moon
was
high
in
the
dark
sky
tents
had
now
been
rigged
up
here
and
there
several
men
were
moving
about
with
lanterns
many
sleeping
on
the
ground
under
a
little
grove
of
alders
a
row
of
horses
were
tied
beyond
them
could
be
distinguished
the
gaunt
shapes
of
waggons
and
guns
unnoticed
the
three
made
their
way
to
the
other
end
of
the
meadows
where
the
frieslanders
were
encamped
there
were
perhaps
three
hundred
of
them
and
they
sat
about
sullenly
among
their
dead
they
had
refused
to
see
after
their
horses
to
bury
the
corpses
even
to
tend
the
wounded
their
one
answer
was
to
demand
food
of
their
officers
and
to
repeat
they
would
not
be
cut
to
bits
by
the
french
the
defection
of
utrecht
had
set
an
ill
example
if
that
great
city
was
afraid
of
louis
what
could
others
do
but
make
their
peace
with
him
an
officer
on
horseback
rode
out
when
he
saw
the
little
company
advancing
here
are
the
prince
and
bentinck
said
his
messenger
the
other
dismounted
ah
your
highness
i
was
loath
to
send
to
you
but
the
men
are
beyond
all
management
and
i
fear
if
the
disaffection
spreads
to
the
others
you
did
very
well
mynheer
the
prince
coughed
and
resumed
i
will
speak
to
will
your
highness
take
my
horse
william
mounted
and
rode
in
amongst
the
men
bentinck
and
the
two
officers
at
his
stirrup
not
knowing
him
they
let
him
pass
without
a
salute
they
believed
that
it
was
one
of
their
own
captains
william
suddenly
halted
and
bent
from
the
saddle
towards
a
little
group
who
stood
whispering
together
do
you
not
know
me
he
asked
they
fell
apart
and
looked
up
his
face
was
quite
clear
in
the
moonlight
for
he
wore
no
hat
and
his
hair
was
tied
back
in
his
neck
i
think
that
you
know
me
he
said
go
fetch
the
others
for
i
would
speak
to
they
moved
back
half
reluctantly
all
these
men
have
arms
highness
warned
the
officer
they
will
not
turn
them
on
me
answered
the
prince
but
bentinck
felt
uneasy
for
william
had
drawn
rein
on
a
slope
of
the
ground
he
was
an
unprotected
object
for
any
carbine
that
might
be
levelled
out
of
the
shadows
of
the
camp
the
news
seemed
to
spread
with
silent
swiftness
the
men
gathered
in
groups
of
fours
and
fives
forming
up
without
noise
until
there
was
a
thick
semicircle
of
them
round
the
prince
it
seemed
they
would
listen
to
what
he
had
to
say
at
least
william
looked
keenly
over
his
mute
audience
and
began
to
speak
in
his
low
deliberate
voice
i
hear
that
you
have
fallen
into
mutinies
and
disobedience
which
is
an
ill
thing
for
soldiers
and
that
you
do
complain
of
hardships
thereby
giving

another
matter
i
hear
some
of
you
talk
of

that
is
a
coward
and
a
traitor
and
a
fool

unjust
and
cruel
masters
and
would
make
slaves
of
you
a
thing
which
is
hateful
to
you
for
love
of

is
a
strong
thing
in
this

philip
was
a
great
king
but
we
bitterly
repulsed
him
with
god
s
grace
and
some
valour
think
of
these
things
for
they
will
hearten
you
and
make
you
see
how
impossible
it
is
that
you
should
forsake
your
liberty
and
your
religion
which
are
such
holy
things
that
to
die
for
them
would
be
a
noble
death
and
no
one
but
a
very
paltry
man
fears
to
die
now
i
ask
you
to
ponder
what
i
have
said
and
obey
your
officers
and
do
your
duty
and
such
of
you
as
do
not
i
will
certainly
hang
for
he
who
is
not
repentant
now
is
no
better
than
a
traitor
and
as
for
what
i
have
said
about
the
provisions
you
have
my
word
on
it
and
therefore
may
rest
tranquil
for
i

as
he
finished
there
was
a
murmur
and
a
sound
of
many
men
drawing
their
breath
ye
who
are
obedient
lay
down
your
arms
said
the
prince
instantly
carbines
bayonets
and
pistols
clattered
on
the
ground
take
them
up
and
hold
them
ready
to
use
again
as
you
used
them
flashed
william
for
god
and
the
united
provinces
a
long
sobbing
shout
rose
from
the
frieslanders
god
the
united
provinces
and
william
of
nassau
the
prince
waved
his
hand
to
them
and
rode
away
as
three
hundred
voices
broke
into
aldegonde
s
hymn
of
liberty
william
of
at
the
edge
of
the
encampment
the
prince
dismounted
after
his
long
speech
he
was
very
silent
your
highness
has
utterly
quelled
all
discontent
murmured
the
officer
god
keep
your
highness
they
were
greatly
moved
said
william
they
will
obey
now
he
took
bentinck
s
arm
and
turned
across
the
camp
neither
spoke
a
word
until
they
reached
the
cottage
then
william
uttered
some
incoherent
sentence
as
bentinck
unlatched
the
door
your
highness
is
ill
the
prince
took
a
step
forward
and
fell
into
his
friend
s
arms
completely
unconscious
my
god
whispered
bentinck
he
pushed
open
the
door
and
called
beverningh
who
came
showing
a
frightened
face
bentinck
lifted
the
prince
easily
enough
and
carried
him
into
the
kitchen
de
zuylestein
was
awake
now
and
poring
over
a
map
on
the
polished
table
he
got
to
his
feet
with
a
little
exclamation
under
his
breath
as
they
had
no
manner
of
bed
or
couch
they
laid
the
prince
on
some
cloaks
along
the
floor
in
a
bewildered
way
they
looked
at
each
other
you
should
never
have
let
him
go
said
beverningh
a
strong
man
could
not
have
stood
what
he
has
put
upon
himself
you
made
no
protest
retorted
william
bentinck
what
influence
have
i
no
nor
any
bentinck
frowned
well
if
he
falls
sick
there
is
an
end
to
all
of
it
for
he
alone
holds
us
catching
up
the
candle
he
flickered
it
across
the
prince
s
unconscious
face
de
zuylestein
was
unbuckling
his
nephew
s
rusty
armour
he
is
not
wounded
he
said
ye
should
never
have
let
him
go
out
again
if
ye
had
been
awake
mynheer
maybe
ye
could
have
stopped
him
replied
bentinck
angrily
much
of
their
reserve
and
fortitude
was
suddenly
shaken
by
this
collapse
the
despair
his
personal
influence
had
kept
at
bay
began
to
seize
hold
of
them
of
the
three
the
lawyer
was
the
calmest
he
put
his
hand
to
the
prince
s
forehead
and
untied
his
cravat
it
is
what
the
foreigners
call
the
dutch
fever
he
said
this
sickness
deadly
and
common
was
well
known
to
all
of
them
it
was
in
symptom
like
a
tertian
ague
caused
strangers
declared
by
the
mists
rising
in
summer
from
the
low
damp
lands
alternate
burning
and
shivering
with
high
fever
and
fierce
pains
what
can
we
do
asked
de
zuylestein
helplessly
with
nothing
we
can
do
nothing
replied
william
bentinck
it
was
surprising
to
reflect
that
a
fortnight
could
reduce
them
from
the
luxury
and
ease
of
the
hague
to
this
kitchen
with
the
prince
lying
unconscious
at
their
feet
and
not
so
much
as
a
cordial
to
revive
him
where
is
matthew
bromley
began
bentinck
then
checked
himself
remembering
that
the
englishman
lay
dead
in
the
adjoining
chamber
de
zuylestein
cursed
the
baggage
waggons
for
having
lost
their
way
and
was
moving
to
summon
outside
assistance
bentinck
checked
him
no
one
can
do
any
more
if
you
let
the
news
abroad
there
will
be
a
panic
and
what
of
the
mutiny
had
he
checked
it
asked
beverningh
who
was
on
his
knees
beside
the
prince
yes
he
can
do
anything
with
the
what
did
he
say
not
much
he
spoke
stiffly
i
thought
and
sincerity
needs
no
arts
murmured
beverningh
they
had
water
but
beverningh
was
against
william
bentinck
s
suggestion
of
bathing
the
prince
s
forehead
it
increased
the
fever
he
said
de
zuylestein
was
for
bleeding
him
but
since
they
had
no
lancet
that
also
was
abandoned
one
of
the
candles
burnt
down
and
they
could
find
no
other
so
had
to
manage
by
the
dismal
light
of
one
if
he
takes
the
fever
said
beverningh
we
are
truly
bentinck
had
found
a
withered
brown
shell
of
a
rose
inside
william
s
waistcoat
he
has
his
sentiments
he
remarked
although
he
guards
them
fiercely
he
picked
this
from
the
tree
his
mother
the
princess
royal
planted
the
last
time
he
was
at
the

think

de

there
is
no
one
to
take

the
hot

wearing
away
the
first
pallid
glow
of
dawn
stole
through
the
window
and
fell
on
the
calm
unconscious
face
of
the
young
captain
general
once
or
twice
he
moved
heavily
as
if
he
were
asleep
bentinck
knelt
beside
him
on
the
glazed
tiles
felt
his
wrist
helplessly
and
pushed
back
the
tangled
damp
auburn
locks
from
his
brow
their
last
candle
burnt
to
the
daylight
then
spluttered
out
in
the
brass
stick
william
suddenly
opened
his
eyes
and
half
sat
up
he
was
shivering
and
the
hand
bentinck
held
was
fever
hot
bentinck
he
said
we
must
get
into
utrecht
and
on
these
words
he
fainted
again
beverningh
looked
at
de
zuylestein
pray
god
king
louis
terms
will
be
reasonable
he
said
grimly

whatever
they
are

snuffed
the

took
off

took
up

at

very

the

on

of

the

was
empty
save
for
this
room
where
john

and
his

sat
completing
the

task
it
was
a
little
chamber
simply
furnished
its

several
handsome
pictures
of

and
still

the

and
were
of

brass
and
the

in

sombre

of

he
wore

and
leant
back
a

in

carved

his
full
brown

were
fixed
on

john

both

looked
exhausted
the

upon

more
than

could
do
he
had
sent
for
his
cousin

to
help
him
in

that
began
to
accumulate
beyond

that

he
read
from
his
notes
entered
utrecht
yesterday
the
people
having
overawed
the
magistrates
his
highness
who
was
sick
of
an
aguish
fever
had
a
scene
with
the
town
council
and
on
their
refusing
to
burn
the
suburbs
or
to
make
any
defence
he
abandoned
them
and
fell
back
on
bodegraven
saying
he
would
not
risk
his
men
in
the
defence
of
such
selfish
unpatriotic
people
he
forced
them
to
provision
his
forces

in

john

rested
his
elbow
on

his

in

his
gaze
was
turned
on
the
peaceful
darkness
beyond

van

gave
a
little
dry
cough
and
resumed
that
the
prince
william
lost
many
men
in
a
desperate
brush
with
the
contingent
of

and
that

protests
that
he
can
not
hold
out
much
longer
in

more
men
if
possible
to

that
the
several

of

put
to
their

of

that
they

at

add
that

be

obeyed
that

dissolute

frivolous

and
come
not

to

their

has
a

of

and
the
least
trusted
by

that
the

that

that
if

were
reinstated
king
charles
would
make
peace
this
false
he
makes
war
not
for
his

sake
but
because
of
the

that
the

utterly
against

he
has
received

from

fresh

that
the

in

half
obscured
by

into

his

the
candid

melancholy
features
that
were
strangely
unlined

simple
in
expression
for
one
whose
years
had
been
so
laboriously
full
he
looked
less
than
his
years
partly
by
reason
of
the
heavy
brown
hair
that
still
fell
so
thickly
on
to
his
shoulders
and
the
full
but
shapely
mouth
whose
lips
lay
together
with
a
fresh
and
youthful
set
of
gentleness
who
is
it
you
will
write
to
mynheer
asked
van
ouvenaller
to
and
to
his
highness
no
answered
john
de
witt
the
hot
stillness
had
a
lulling
quality
lassitude
was
in
the
perfume
of
the
silent
darkness
for
once
john
de
witt
seemed
reluctant
to
turn
to
his
work
he
stood
with
one
hand
resting
on
the
mullions
and
his
eyes
were
dreamy
van
ouvenaller
yawned
i
remember
remarked
the
grand
pensionary
how
it
was
said
to
me
twenty
years
ago
when
i
took
up
this
office
thou
must
not
care
henceforth
whether
thou
be
laid
in
thy
coffin
whole
or
in
the
clerk
lifted
a
startled
face
latterly
i
have
thought
of
it
continued
his
master
how
the
people
hate
i
never
thought
that
i
should
be
so
mynheer
they
are
but
fanatics
fanatics
echoed
john
de
witt
with
a
sad
smile
they
think
i
sell
them
to
de
he
pressed
his
hand
to
his
heart
as
if
he
was
wounded
there
when
they
took
this
office
from
my
predecessor
cats
he
thanked
god
on
his
knees
for
removing
such
a
heavy
burden
from
well
he
was
never
hated
as
i
mynheer
it
is
but
the
vulgar
who
rail
against
john
de
witt
turned
his
full
eyes
on
the
secretary
it
is
the
people
he
said
mournfully
the
people
of
this
republic
if
they
trusted
me
i
could
save
them
yet
if
they
trusted
me
he
returned
to
the
table
and
took
up
the
pen
i
must
make
some
answer
to
that
pamphlet
to
every
faithful
there
are
accusations
there
must
not
be
overlooked
their
high
mightinesses
will
do
me
that
justice
to
silence
some
of
these
lying
tongues
remind
me
van
ouvenaller
many
thousand
copies
have
been
sold
here
alone
he
spoke
proudly
and
frowned
a
little
his
clerk
knew
that
the
malice
detraction
and
bitterness
surrounding
him
harassed
his
noble
spirit
sorely
he
walked
like
an
unarmed
man
among
gathered
spears
that
might
any
moment
be
turned
against
his
heart
and
is
this
all
we
have
to
do
mynheer
asked
the
clerk
van
ouvenaller
began
to
put
up
the
papers
in
the
dispatch
bag
when
he
rose
he
walked
stiffly
by
reason
of
his
long
sitting
john
de
witt
s
pen
travelled
rapidly
over
the
smooth
paper
once
he
began
his
eager
spirit
did
not
lack
for
means
of
expression
his
unwearied
soul
held
his
tired
body
to
the
task
his
letter
to
jerome
beverningh
ended
thus
we
must
consider
amsterdam
as
the
heart
of
the
state
by
which
succour
may
be
carried
to
all
its
members
so
that
under
god
s
guidance
we
may
fight
against
the
enemy
for
our
country
to
the
last
man
and
with
dutch
he
folded
and
sealed
his
letter
then
rose
again
it
was
now
nearly
midnight
and
the
heat
increasing
the
faint
breeze
had
completely
dropped
you
will
go
home
now
asked
van
ouvenaller
anxiously
it
is
so
late
and
you
mynheer
have
laboured
exceedingly
it
is
not
the
labour
that
irks
but
the
payment
answered
john
de
witt
i
learn
with
sorrow
the
truth
of
the
ancient
saying
they
applied
to
the
roman
republic
prospera
omnes
sibi
vindicant
adversa
uni
ah
van
ouvenaller
they
say
from
the
very
pulpits
that
i
would
sooner
let
the
country
go
to
the
french
than
see
the
prince
of
orange
governor
of
the
calvinists
are
all
ardent
in
his
favour
replied
the
secretary
naturally
for
he
is
very
zealous
for
their
john
de
witt
took
his
hat
and
cloak
from
a
chair
i
hope
my
sister
hath
not
sat
up
for
she
always
does
answered
van
ouvenaller
drawing
the
string
of
the
i
am
so
he
waited
while
the
clerk
locked
up
the
desk
then
extinguished
all
the
candles
but
one
which
he
took
up
and
carried
into
the
outer
room
there
by
the
dim
light
of
a
lamp
sat
his
servant
asleep
van
den
wissel
said
john
de
witt
the
man
woke
with
a
start
and
a
confused
excuse
no
matter
answered
his
master
i
am
going
home
he
gave
the
servant
the
candle
and
the
three
traversed
the
silent
corridors
of
the
binnenhof
in
the
courtyard
was
a
little
delay
while
van
den
wissel
lit
a
torch
with
which
to
guide
them
home
as
the
chimes
of
the
groote
kerk
struck
twelve
they
set
out
across
the
buitenhof
the
servant
ahead
bearing
the
torch
and
van
ouvenaller
following
with
the
the
outer
air
and
the
movement
refreshed
the
grand
pensionary
he
found
the
dark
night
and
the
darker
outlines
of
the
fine
buildings
grateful
to
his
tired
eyes
the
silence
pleasant
after
the
scratching
of
the
quills
and
the
weary
voice
of
the
little
clerk
his
anxious
thoughts
took
a
more
peaceful
turn
his
pious
fancy
imagined
the
serene
stars
promised
protection
from
the
god
they
concealed
but
as
he
neared
the
gevangenpoort
he
must
needs
think
of
john
van
olden
barnenveldt
and
gloomy
auguries
they
turned
under
the
prison
through
the
low
gate
on
which
it
was
built
the
spreading
light
of
the
torch
showed
the
heavy
walls
closely
confining
them
and
john
de
witt
shivered
in
his
velvet
he
was
glad
when
they
reached
the
trees
surrounding
the
vyver
it
was
solitary
as
always
at
this
time
of
night
but
he
thought
he
heard
an
unaccountable
sound
van
ouvenaller
he
spoke
over
his
shoulder
do
you
hear
anything
nothing
mynheer
was
the
sleepy
answer
i
thought
i
heard
some
one
draw
a
sword
replied
john
de
witt
peering
into
the
shadows
of
the
trees
even
as
he
spoke
there
was
a
great
cry
from
his
servant
the
torch
was
swung
up
into
the
air
where
it
scattered
sparks
across
the
blackness
then
dashed
to
the
earth
some
dark
shapes
leapt
ah
cried
john
de
witt
with
a
quick
intake
of
his
breath
we
have
been
waiting
for
you
answered
a
youthful
voice
watching
your
light
yonder
traitor
m
de
witt
yelled
the
clerk
dismally
then
he
was
silent
suddenly
and
the
grand
pensionary
heard
him
fall
it
was
quite
dark
he
stepped
back
against
the
railings
and
called
his
servant
a
man
quickly
closed
with
him
i
am
unarmed
he
said
are
you
an
assassin
his
opponent
flung
himself
on
him
and
thrust
his
sword
viciously
at
him
wounding
him
in
the
throat
taken
by
surprise
as
he
was
john
de
witt
turned
seized
his
assailant
and
hurled
him
off
van
den
wissel
he
called
again
but
the
only
answer
came
from
two
others
of
the
ambuscade
who
rushed
to
the
assistance
of
the
one
the
grand
pensionary
had
thrown
he
had
now
three
against
him
he
set
his
back
against
the
railings
and
fought
them
off
with
his
bare
hands
proudly
saying
nothing
though
every
moment
he
received
a
fresh
wound
it
could
not
last
long
as
he
turned
to
face
one
another
stabbed
him
in
the
back
and
he
fell
silently
striking
his
head
violently
against
the
railings
of
the
vyver
hoarse
broken
whispers
came
from
the
murderers
is
he
dead
he
yes
he
is
who
struck
him
i
jacob
van
der
hush
i

not

not

i
am
wounded
where

borrebagh
where
shall
we
go
to
van
dyck
s
make
so
four
hoarse
voices
passed
to
and
fro
as
the
assassins
stumbled
among
their
victims
then
they
made
off
across
the
plaats
with
all
the
haste
terror
exultation
and
their
wounds
would
permit
them
once
more
it
was
utterly
silent
on
the
plaats
the
great
chimes
of
the
groote
kerk
struck
through
a
warm
stillness
john
de
witt
sat
up
and
fumbled
in
the
dark
emptiness
and
perfect
blackness
seemed
about
him
he
put
his
hand
to
his
head
and
felt
it
warm
and
wet
van
ouvenaller
he
called
faintly
there
was
no
answer
by
the
aid
of
the
railings
he
got
to
his
feet
his
right
shoulder
gave
him
exquisite
pain
his
strength
seemed
to
have
been
utterly
robbed
from
him
he
clutched
at
his
collar
that
was
all
sticky
with
blood
and
gave
a
soft
exclamation
god
be
with
me
if
this
is
death
he
said
dazedly
then
across
the
night
he
saw
the
light
they
always
left
for
him
in
his
room
at
home
a
sudden
waft
of
perfume
from
the
limes
came
to
his
nostrils
i
will
not
die
in
the
streets
like
a
gallant
in
a
tavern
brawl
he
thought
and
forced
his
failing
strength
to
drag
him
on
clutching
the
railings
the
staggering
falling
once
or
twice
to
his
knees
john
de
witt
gained
his
house
at
the
corner
of
the
kneuterdyk
avenue
as
he
leant
exhausted
against
the
it
occurred
to
him
that
his
appearance
would
frighten
his
sister
and
daughter
who
might
still
be
up
he
tried
to
fling
his
velvet
mantle
over
himself
but
could
not
a
great
giddiness
came
over
him
he
opened
the
door
and
stumbled
into
the
quiet
hall
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
stood
anna
de
witt
in
a
white
gown
her
fair
hair
shining
in
the
glimmer
of
the
lamp
she
held
oh
she
cried
brokenly
o
oh
and
ran
forward
john
de
witt
was
blood
from
head
to
foot
his
collar
soaked
from
the
wound
in
his
throat
his
hands
red
and
torn
his
shirt
stained
his
forehead
bruised
and
the
hair
clotted
with
the
slow
drippings
from
the
gash
in
his
head
he
tried
to
reassure
his
daughter
dearest
i
have
escaped
why
this
is
nothing

all

anna
the
girl

she
made
no
lamentations

where

said
anna
de
witt
johanna
stepped
into
the
hall
and
her
eyes
fell
on
the
grand
pensionary
who
supported
himself
against
the
wall
god
have
mercy
on
us
she
exclaimed
she
had
a
blue
china
bowl
of
peaches
in
her
hands
in
a
mechanical
way
she
set
it
down
on
the
table
where
anna
had
placed
the
lamp
john
she
caught
her
brother
by
the
arm
come
i
was
attacked
on
the
vyverberg
said
the
grand
pensionary
thickly
how
they
hate

anna
rouse
your
grandfather
the
servants

one
for
the
physicians
of
the
states
and
wilde
john

dashed
into
the
and
rang
the
bell
sped
upstairs
and
beat
on
jacob
de
witt
s
door
when
she
returned
to
the
hall
she
found
john
de
witt
senseless
in
the
chair
outside
the
door
and
his
sister
bending
over
him
her
spotless
gown
stained
with
blood
as
she
strove
to
stanch
the
wound
in
his
throat
in
a
moment
the
whole
house
was
in
a
commotion
de
witt
had
only
two
one
of
whom
had
been
with
him
at
the
binnenhof
but
the
coachman
and
the
other
private
clerk
bacherus
carried
him
up
to
his
room
then
hurried
out
with
torches
to
fetch
a
doctor
and
search
for
the
other
victims
jacob
de
witt
lost
his
usual
resignation
he
wrung
his
hands
and
cried
out
for
cornelius
for
he
was
very
old
anna
led
him
gently
away
god
does
not
will
that
my
father
should
die
she
said
we
must
not
complain
but
rather
rejoice
that
through
a
miracle
he
hath
been
god
s
will
be
done
said
the
old
man
but
the
tears
rolled
down
his
pale
cheeks
anna
sat
beside
him
holding
his
hand
in
the
where
the
untouched
supper
showed
pleasant
in
the
candlelight
while
the
doctors
went
upstairs
presently
wilde
entered
the
wounds
are
not
mortal
he
said
m
de
witt
will
part
iii
the
crisis
since
octavius

world
had
seen
no
such
instance
of
precocious

motto
on
a
medal
in
commemoration
of
august
chapter
i
the
camp
of
the
conqueror
sir
gabriel
sylvius
arrived
at
doesburg
to
find
that
king
louis
was
already
on
the
road
to
utrecht
immediately
came
news
of
his
entry
into
that
town
and
his
choice
of
headquarters
at
zeyst
the
castle
of
van
odyk
the
alarmed
states
deprived
of
the
leadership
of
john
de
witt
who
was
confined
to
his
bed
with
a
raging
fever
from
his
wounds
had
given
de
groot
full
powers
to
treat
with
king
louis
and
he
despite
the
violent
remonstrances
of
fagel
repaired
with
van
ghent
to
the
camp
of
the
conqueror
on
a
desperate
attempt
to
obtain
honourable
terms
for
his
distracted
country
sir
gabriel
sylvius
retraced
his
steps
over
the
conquered
and
despairing
provinces
of
overyssel
and
guelders
where
de
luxembourg
was
making
the
people
taste
the
full
severities
of
military
rule
and
took
lodgings
in
utrecht
the
day
before
his
arrival
de
groot
had
returned
from
the
hague
hastily
for
fear
the
orange
party
should
prevent
his
departure
and
sir
gabriel
found
the
old
castle
of
zeyst
the
head
of
the
negotiations
that
were
to
decide
the
fate
of
the
united
provinces
louis
having
taken
utrecht
and
forced
the
dutch
to
the
humiliation
of
returning
de
groot
with
full
powers
to
treat
for
peace
deigned
to
allow
a
truce
the
prince
of
orange
with
the
remnant
of
his
forces
lay
at
newerbrugge
between
leyden
and
haarlem
and
de
turenne
sweeping
the
protestants
down
with
the
fervour
of
a
convert
made
preparations
to
annihilate
him
should
the
negotiations
fall
through
he
declared
his
majesty
should
dine
at
the
hague
within
the
next
month
as
friend
or
foe
and
swore
it
before
the
saints
he
had
recently
recognised
he
was
the
more
eager
as
de
condé
wounded
at
the
passage
of
the
rhine
had
retired
to
chantilly
and
his
now
was
the
sole
glory
of
the
war
sir
gabriel
sent
his
name
and
credentials
to
de
louvois
and
to
the
surprise
of
his
secretary
florent
van
mander
the
acknowledgment
was
an
instant
command
to
attend
his
majesty
to
florent
s
further
surprise
they
were
received
with
great
courtesy
by
the
gorgeous
officials
who
shed
splendour
on
the
french
court
van
mander
knew
that
the
dutch
envoys
had
been
met
with
a
supreme
haughtiness
he
held
de
groot
a
much
greater
man
than
sir
gabriel
sylvius
who
was
after
all
only
the
secret
messenger
of
a
citizen
but
louis
made
a
fine
distinction
between
the
representative
of
a
confederation
of
traders
whom
he
had
always
disliked
despised
and
now
regarded
as
conquered
and
william
of
orange
his
cousin
a
prince
of
the
blood
royal
of
england
a
grandee
of
the
german
empire
the
possessor
of
one
of
the
finest
private
fortunes
in
europe
and
the
owner
of
talents
and
qualities
that
might
well
fit
him
to
join
the
galaxy
of
great
names
that
shed
lustre
on
the
crown
of
louis
de
bourbon
so
the
prince
s
envoy
was
received
graciously
at
the
castle
of
zeyst
he
arrived
there
towards
the
close
of
a
warm
day
soon
after
his
majesty
had
returned
from
an
inspection
of
utrecht
s
fortifications
he
was
conducted
with
his
secretary
into
one
of
the
chambers
that
opened
into
the
great
where
once
van
odyk
had
entertained
his
master
florent
van
mander
had
just
crossed
a
conquered
province
and
was
lodged
in
a
conquered
city
he
had
seen
the
host
carried
through
the
streets
of
utrecht
and
listened
to
the
chants
of
the
priests
that
had
not
been
heard
in
the
united
provinces
since
they
drove
out
farnese
he
had
seen
his
countrymen
killed
spurned
insulted
he
had
seen
their
dwellings
fired
their
goods
plundered
he
had
seen
the
burgomasters
submit
humbly
to
the
omnipotent
king
and
now
he
was
looking
on
the
inner
side
of
this
terrible
army
that
had
taken
two
provinces
in
so
many
weeks
he
made
no
comment
he
had
said
very
little
since
he
left
the
prince
s
camp
sir
gabriel
had
an
open
manner
that
disguised
complete
reserve
florent
fed
his
silence
with
rumours
of
the
wounding
of
de
witt
of
the
frantic
state
of
feeling
in
holland
of
de
groot
s
desperate
mission
of
the
arrival
of
the
english
envoys
at
the
hague
of
the
rapacity
of
de
louvois
and
the
arrogance
of
his
master
which
things
he
considered
and
reflected
upon
day
and
night
the
castle
was
filled
with
french
officers
splendid
men
of
graceful
manners
van
mander
found
them
as
dazzling
as
the
reports
of
their
exploits
looking
at
them
he
felt
that
his
country
was
already
a
province
of
france
and
he
thought
of
william
of
orange
and
wondered
why
sir
gabriel
sought
an
audience
with
the
conqueror
yet
he
believed
that
he
knew
the
room
they
waited
in
was
very
handsomely
hung
with
flemish
tapestry
representing
the
story
of
the
unicorn
and
furnished
with
inlaid
spanish
pieces
for
van
odyk
had
wealth
and
good
taste
the
door
into
the
next
chamber
was
curtained
with
dark
velvet
looped
back
and
from
behind
it
came
the
sound
of
a
man
singing
in
a
voice
of
a
pleasant
medium
quality
he
sang
in
english
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
lute
sir
gabriel
walked
up
and
down
the
room
glancing
out
of
the
deep
windows
he
passed
at
the
french
soldiers
in
their
gay
uniforms
filling
the
grey
courtyard
below
he
held
his
hat
behind
his
back
and
his
shrewd
freckled
face
was
set
in
lines
of
reflection
van
mander
stared
at
the
contorted
figures
on
the
arras
and
listened
to
the
clatter
of
horses
and
arms
from
without
above
it
all
rose
the
near
sound
of
the
english
song
fairest
jane
all
janes
excelling
as
my
wish
exceeds
my
skill
tears
within
your
eyes
are
swelling
i
perceive
you
love
me
still
sir
gabriel
stopped
by
the
window
and
frowned
he
was
impatient
at
being
kept
waiting
even
by
his
majesty
the
singer
paused
and
seemed
to
fidget
with
the
strings
of
his
instrument
that
he
played
but
moderately
well
sweetness
best
becomes
your
beauty
would
you
chide
when
we
must
part
to
the
king
belongs
my
duty
but
to
you
belongs
my
florent
became
curious
to
see
who
sang
sir
gabriel
seemed
so
he
rose
and
moved
so
that
he
could
see
beyond
the
curtain
into
the
inner
room
just
beyond
the
door
he
saw
a
young
man
with
one
foot
on
a
chair
holding
across
his
knee
a
lute
of
shining
ivory
and
satinwood
his
face
was
turned
away
his
person
was
a
matter
of
great
marvel
and
admiration
to
florent
who
had
never
seen
anything
more
splendid
than
this
cavalier
he
was
a
man
very
young
it
seemed
and
dressed
in
a
dark
rose
brocade
stiff
with
threads
of
silver
and
fastened
with
little
knots
of
pearls
round
his
waist
was
a
white
silk
sash
branched
and
fringed
with
silver
his
sleeves
were
unbuttoned
and
turned
back
over
his
rich
needlework
shirt
he
wore
a
deep
falling
collar
of
venetian
lace
and
had
fine
ruffles
of
it
at
his
wrists
and
knees
a
baldric
of
white
velvet
worked
with
jewels
supported
his
slender
sword
with
its
curious
gold
hilt
his
close
high
boots
were
of
white
leather
and
his
spurs
gilt
and
fantastically
shaped
on
the
chair
lay
his
gloves
trimmed
with
pearls
and
his
grey
hat
with
an
upright
plume
of
white
feathers
and
twisted
with
a
silver
cord
fastened
with
a
diamond
brooch
as
van
mander
stared
at
him
he
seemed
to
become
conscious
of
the
scrutiny
and
turned
his
head
revealing
the
most
beautiful
face
florent
had
ever
seen
on
man
or
woman
yet
the
sheer
perfection
of
curving
line
and
warm
brown
colour
made
not
the
chief
attraction
this
lay
in
the
expression
a
charming
combination
of
and
sweetness
amiability
and
an
innocent
pride
a
face
by
no
means
effeminate
not
very
intelligent
but
wholly
lovely
and
lovable
he
had
deep
soft
brown
eyes
straight
thick
brows
a
blunt
english
nose
a
fair
complexion
a
beautiful
and
expressive
mouth
his
thick
waving
chestnut
hair
fell
in
curls
on
to
his
shoulders
and
on
the
left
side
was
tied
with
a
knot
of
pink
ribbon
a
fashion
florent
had
not
seen
before
his
glance
dwelt
for
a
moment
on
the
man
observing
him
then
he
turned
away
again
bending
over
the
gleaming
lute
but
now
without
singing
sir
gabriel
came
from
the
window
and
florent
went
over
to
him
who
is
that
cavalier
in
there
decked
out
like
a
woman
he
whispered
is
there
one
in
there
yes
mynheer
he
who
ah
yes
sir
gabriel
crossed
the
room
and
looked
into
the
outer
chamber
the
lutanist
had
set
his
instrument
down
and
was
gathering
up
his
gloves
and
hat
it
is
the
englishman
said
sir
gabriel
indifferently
the
englishman
the
prince
james
of
the
duke
heard
his
name
and
held
back
the
curtain
sir
gabriel
bowed
i
await
an
audience
with
his
majesty
your
the
englishman
gave
them
both
the
sweet
smile
he
had
for
every
one
ah
sir
gabriel
i
did
not
think
to
see
you
again
so
soon
nor
i
your
you
come
from
the
prince
of
orange
asked
monmouth
he
spoke
in
english
for
he
had
no
other
language
but
a
little
imperfect
french
and
florent
who
could
not
understand
what
he
said
dwelt
on
his
glittering
presence
with
a
slow
admiration
yes
answered
sir
gabriel
with
a
little
smile
the
duke
smiled
again
too
for
no
reason
but
it
has
been
a
most
marvellous
campaign
he
remarked
with
his
usual
utter
absence
of
tact
a
glorious
beginning
to
the
war
for
the
king
of
france
your
grace
replied
sir
gabriel
i
am
in
the
service
of
the
prince
of
ah
yes
forgive
me
said
monmouth
sweetly
but
i
hope
it
will
be
to
his
highness
advantage
with
which
vague
remark
he
changed
the
subject
did
you
see
my
lord
arlington
lately
i
crossed
from
harwich
with
his
grace
half
frowned
i
should
have
heard
from
him
it
is
astonishing
sir
gabriel
how
difficult
it
is
to
get
letters
i
can
believe
it
my
lord
promised
me
supplies
of
money
said
the
englishman
frankly
which
i
am
already
in
need
of
he
paused
a
moment
and
then
added
but
i
can
take
you
to
his
majesty
now
sir
gabriel
i
do
not
know
why
they
make
he
pulled
out
a
little
crystal
watch
it
is
near
i
will
take
you
with
me
and
you
may
see
his
majesty
before
he
i
shall
be
infinitely
obliged
your
monmouth
included
the
secretary
in
a
sweetly
courteous
glance
and
begged
them
to
follow
him
have
you
seen
our
soldiers
sir
gabriel
he
asked
as
they
proceeded
through
van
odyk
s
handsome
chambers
by
the
lord
tis
a
mighty
fine
i
hear
your
grace
has
distinguished
yourself
oh
la
i
don
t
know
it
is
vastly
amusing
being
a
general
sir
they
traversed
a
large
antechamber
filled
with
bowing
pages
and
several
officers
of
the
king
s
guard
who
swept
off
their
hats
to
the
commander
of
the
english
forces
we
are
private
and
informal
here
said
monmouth
who
was
used
to
splendour
ever
since
he
could
remember
and
he
opened
the
door
into
what
had
once
been
van
odyk
s
private
sir
gabriel
spoke
to
florent
in
their
own
language
over
his
shoulder
now
you
will
see
a
notable
this
with
a
as
if
the
greatness
there
was
such
a
stir
about
in
europe
was
not
so
dazzling
on
a
near
view
it
was
a
fine
room
the
ceiling
beamed
and
painted
the
walls
panelled
up
and
above
that
hung
with
arras
save
over
the
mantelshelf
where
the
woodwork
rose
to
the
ceiling
and
formed
a
background
for
some
dark
family
portraits
there
were
velvet
cushions
in
the
deep
and
on
the
various
carved
chairs
and
on
a
handsome
buffet
a
rich
collection
of
glass
and
gold
and
silver
plate
the
usual
quietly
splendid
and
plainly
costly
chamber
of
a
dutch
nobleman
seated
at
the
head
of
the
long
table
were
two
men
looking
at
a
map
one
young
scarcely
at
his
prime
short
stoutly
made
with
a
broad
vigorous
face
and
crimped
brown
hair
falling
on
to
his
collar
dressed
in
black
silk
ruffled
with
red
ribbons
the
other
a
man
of
about
also
below
the
medium
height
but
slender
with
a
brown
handsome
countenance
long
effective
eyes
an
imperious
mouth
and
a
hard
expression
of
pride
and
obstinacy
he
wore
green
velvet
cut
short
in
the
french
fashion
to
show
his
shirt
a
gold
baldric
and
no
ornament
save
a
little
brooch
of
pearls
at
his
collar
his
hair
chestnut
colour
and
very
fine
was
frizzed
to
stand
out
in
a
multitude
of
little
curls
that
fell
to
the
middle
of
his
shoulders
behind
him
leaning
on
the
back
of
his
chair
stood
another
gentleman
eating
chocolates
who
was
far
more
richly
dressed
being
nearly
as
extravagant
as
my
lord
monmouth
but
not
near
so
handsome
though
of
a
delicate
face
and
a
graceful
carriage
standing
by
the
hearth
was
a
tall
man
very
plainly
habited
in
brown
velvet
well
past
middle
life
but
erect
and
powerful
with
haggard
features
fiery
eyes
and
an
air
of
melancholy
dishevelled
grandeur
of
these
four
he
had
the
most
appearance
of
greatness
and
seemed
to
know
it
and
to
despise
his
surroundings
monmouth
advanced
his
hat
in
his
hand
the
man
in
the
green
velvet
turned
in
his
chair
sire
this
is
sir
gabriel
the
messenger
from
his
highness
of
orange
said
his
grace
florent
stared
wondering
which
was
the
king
and
attracted
by
the
man
on
the
hearth
who
took
no
notice
of
any
we
are
glad
to
see
you
monsieur
said
the
gentleman
in
green
graciously
and
then
florent
knew
that
he
was
the
king
for
sir
gabriel
knelt
and
kissed
his
hand
when
he
rose
he
motioned
towards
florent
my
secretary
sire
who
is
in
his
highness
florent
bowed
very
low
you
are
both
very
welcome
to
zeyst
said
louis
m
de
louvois
and
he
looked
at
the
other
seated
at
the
table
advertised
us
of
your
coming
and
pressed
as
we
are
with
great
affairs
we
were
very
pleased
to
grant
you
an
he
had
an
air
of
great
and
distant
dignity
but
he
made
it
plain
that
he
wished
to
be
gracious
sir
gabriel
in
no
way
discomposed
bowed
again
sire
i
am
no
accredited
ambassador
but
the
private
agent
of
the
prince
as
your
majesty
knows
and
the
first
object
of
my
mission
was
to
the
commissioners
of
his
majesty
king
charles
but
i
received
instructions
from
his
highness
to
wait
on
you
to
tender
you
his
duty
and
to
ask
your
majesty
if
you
would
be
pleased
to
enlighten
him
not
as
a
subject
of
the
united
provinces
but
as
a
member
of
your
majesty
s
house
what
terms
your
majesty
desires
from
the
united
provinces
the
king
seemed
pleased
with
this
speech
de
louvois
looked
up
sharply
from
his
map
monmouth
and
the
gentleman
from
behind
louis
chair
had
withdrawn
together
to
a
window
embrasure
as
if
business
was
small
matter
to
either
of
them
my
cousin
sends
to
us
as
a
private
person
asked
the
king
as
affairs
stand
sire
his
highness
is
no
louis
lifted
his
fine
eyes
i
have
no
quarrel
with
the
prince
of
orange
sir
gabriel
he
hath
been
unjustly
treated
by
these
insolent
states
whose
outrages
on
myself
i
have
chastised
and
his
britannic
majesty
hath
a
great
affection
for
him
i
speak
he
glanced
at
de
louvois
we
war
he
added
arrogantly
with
a
republic
that
hath
annoyed
us
not
with
our
i
thank
you
de
louvois
was
listening
intently
m
de
groot
continued
louis
has
our
terms
if
the
states
refuse
them
we
shall
advance
on
the
de
louvois
spoke
your
countrymen
think
those
terms
severe
do
they
not
sir
gabriel
they
are
hardly
blown
abroad
yet
le
i
believe
the
states
have
the
folly
to
complain
of
what
we
choose
to
dictate
to
them
but
i
think
they
will
accept
remarked
the
king
i
would
remind
your
majesty
this
is
no
affair
of
his
i
know
assented
louis
and
i
will
tell
you
this
for
his
highness
private
satisfaction
that
his
advantage
is
clearly
looked
to
in
these
same
articles
of
i
was
assured
so
in
london
louis
faintly
smiled
what
is
said
in
london
i
generally
say
first
sir
the
prince
s
messenger
bowed
i
am
well
enough
informed
to
know
who
rules
europe
his
majesty
accepted
the
compliment
with
serene
graciousness
let
his
highness
put
his
affairs
in
my
hands
and
he
will
not
repent
it
sir
de
louvois
spoke
again
i
hear
there
is
some
talk
of
a
revolution
at
the
hague
de
witt
has
lost
all
the
dutchman
avoided
a
direct
answer
his
highness
is
very
louis
made
a
disdainful
gesture
with
his
hand
i
can
do
better
for
my
cousin
than
a
confederacy
of
traders
cadets
of
my
house
monsieur
need
never
lack
glorious
employment
the
arms
of
france
will
always
receive
noble
he
smiled
again
the
prince
s
behaviour
has
pleased
me
de
condé
commended
his
generalship
it
is
thought
that
he
might
fashion
into
a
fine
soldier
he
has
made
mistakes
notably
in
abandoning
the
yssel
but
i
believe
there
were
difficulties
in
his
way
great
difficulties
he
wastes
his
talents
in
these
uninhabitable
marshes
we
shall
look
to
see
him
at
his
majesty
was
invitingly
pleasant
tell
this
to
my
cousin
i
hear
he
has
he
must
take
care
of
it
i
am
anxious
to
see
him
i
hope
he
will
attend
me
at
the
hague
after
the
conclusion
of
sire
after
proving
yourself
as
irresistible
as
alexander
you
show
yourself
as
generous
as
louis
said
nothing
to
this
he
covered
his
absolute
ignorance
of
which
he
was
heartily
ashamed
with
a
perfect
manner
and
an
unmoved
front
de
louvois
smiled
dryly
he
wore
the
air
of
a
ruler
even
of
the
king
he
administered
the
commissariat
department
the
brilliant
management
of
which
had
largely
helped
to
secure
the
successes
of
the
campaign
and
considered
himself
equally
great
with
and
far
more
valuable
than
any
general
i
am
to
assure
his
highness
of
your
majesty
s
friendship
sylvius
bowed
on
a
note
of
interrogation
you
may
give
him
said
louis
with
a
large
air
of
generosity
a
proof
of
it
i
have
ordered
that
my
troops
are
to
spare

added
de

the
duke

sharply

gabriel

see
the
fourth
man
who
had
remained
all
this
time
apart
now
approached
the
little
group
if
your
majesty
will
give
me
leave
i
am
due
in
he
wore
brown
velvet
touched
with
gold
and
had
a
noble
careless
presence
louis
answered
him
with
deference
i
do
not
presume
to
give
you
orders
as
you
know
de
the
vicomte
bowed
m
vauban
requested

then
i
must
not
keep

answered
louis
gracefully
but
first
this
is
a
messenger
from
my
cousin
the
little
prince
of
de
turenne
fixed
his
searching
eyes
on
sir
gabriel
and
a
faint
colour
tinged
his
worn
cheeks
turenne
s
mother
had
come
of
the
house
of
nassau
nearly
all
his
life
he
had
belonged
to
the
reformed
religion
but
he
had
sacrificed
his
conscience
to
his
glory
his
faith
to
his
fame
am
i
to
have
the
prince
of
orange
on
my
staff
sire
he
asked
with
a
touch
of
scorn
we
hope
so
le
vicomte
answered
louis
suavely
the
great
soldier
gave
his
master
a
curious
look
so
you
have
tempted
him
too
he
said
your
majesty
is
it
is
you
who
have
made
me
so
replied
the
king
de
louvois
smiled
at
this
sourly
there
are
some
of
your
majesty
s
triumphs
that
i
have
had
no
hand
in
said
de
turenne
those
i
must
thank
le
marquis
de
louvois
for
responded
louis
with
his
air
of
greatness
whom
will
you
thank
when
the
prince
of
orange
goes
to
mass
sire
it
will
be
the
prince
who
will
thank
me
monsieur
le
vicomte
answered
his
majesty
de
turenne
spoke
his
tone
slightly
sarcastic
you
are
very
fortunate
sire
to
be
able
to
buy
everything
even
men
s
louis
straight
brows
rose
a
little
what
price
continued
de
turenne
will
your
majesty
give
for
this
the
conscience
of
a
calvinist
louis
looked
at
him
straightly
that
which
bought
one
before
he
answered
my
de
louvois
stole
a
malicious
glance
at
d
orleans
the
vicomte
de
turenne
bowed
hitched
up
his
baldric
and
left
the
chamber
heavily
the
king
s
face
was
clouded
what
is
amiss
with
de
turenne
he
asked
haughtily
he
has
his
moods
sire
smiled
the
minister
he
says
the
strangest
things
remarked
louis
why
does
he
remind
me
he
was
once
a
heretic
it
gave
your
majesty
the
chance
to
remind
him
what
procured
his
conversion
answered
d
orleans
louis
pulled
out
his
handkerchief
and
pressed
it
to
his
lips
i
will
take
de
turenne
s
moods
he
said
but
no
one
s
comments
on
he
rose
and
turned
to
sir
gabriel
who
awaited
his
dismissal
i
hope
to
see
you
at
the
review
this
evening
monsieur
convey
my
very
good
friendship
to
his
he
held
out
his
fine
hand
and
sir
gabriel
kissed
it
then
bowed
severally
to
the
other
gentlemen
de
louvois
gave
him
a
curt
nod
d
orleans
was
vacant
and
the
englishman
came
to
the
door
with
him
you
have
reason
to
be
satisfied
his
majesty
is
very
well
disposed
towards
you
commend
me
to
his
highness
i
hope
we
shall
both
be
fighting
under
the
same
i
thank
your
the
fair
face
smiled
in
an
eager
fascinating
manner
as
if
his
grace
s
one
desire
was
to
please
sir
gabriel
but
in
reality
he
hardly
understood
the
matter
and
was
wholly
indifferent
to
it
his
mind
being
occupied
with
a
game
of
tennis
he
proposed
with
d
orleans
and
his
assumed
interest
being
merely
his
good
nature
florent
gazed
at
him
then
for
an
instant
back
at
the
man
wearing
green
velvet
and
frizzed
hair
who
was
the
king
of
france
he
looked
at
the
man
beside
him
alert
composed
and
commonplace
de
louvois
feared
throughout
europe
a
page
in
gorgeous
livery
conducted
them
through
the
castle
florent
bewildered
and
disturbed
was
further
troubled
as
they
passed
along
the
handsome
rooms
by
a
glimpse
through
an
open
door
of
three
people
madame
lavalette
was
one
de
pomponne
and
hyacinthe
croix
the
others
croix
looking
up
recognised
florent
and
nodded
in
a
meaning
way
van
mander
frowned
and
coloured
when
they
were
clear
of
the
castle
and
its
dazzle
of
pomp
and
soldiery
he
turned
abruptly
to
sir
gabriel
what
does
it
mean
mynheer
gabriel
sylvius
answered
composedly
it
means
i
can
tell
his
highness
not
to
concern
himself
about
the
terms
offered
to
de
groot
for
his
majesty
is
entirely
friendly
and
will
do
more
for
the
prince
than
the
states
could
ever
which
is
to
say
his
highness
will
change
his
religion
said
florent
gloomily
sir
gabriel
smiled
we
must
not
commit
ourselves
as
to
that
but
it
is
possible
that
in
a
little
while
the
theology
of
geneva
will
be
extremely

ii
the
tempters
mynheer
if
you
call
the
position
one
of
absolute
despair
said
william
bentinck
you
will
not
be
he
spoke
to
beuningen
late
ambassador
to
england
who
was
now
employed
on
desperate
errands
between
the
states
and
the
prince
it
was
afternoon
warm
and
cloudy
the
two
walked
up
and
down
the
little
garden
belonging
to
the
farm
where
the
captain
general
had
fixed
his
headquarters
about
them
lay
the
encampment
the
remnant
of
the
dutch
army
thirteen
thousand
men
had
been
gathered
here
at
newerbrugge
to
defend
the
two
remaining
provinces
in
concordance
with
the
dauntless
policy
of
the
prince
which
was
in
direct
contrast
to
the
consternation
desperation
and
submission
displayed
by
the
government
van
beuningen
accomplished
voluble
charming
and
impetuous
fair
handsome
and
finely
dressed
was
silent
awhile
fixing
his
blue
eyes
on
the
distant
sluggish
waters
of
the
old
rhine
bentinck
spoke
again
louis
will
be
at
the
hague
in
a
how
can
you
utter
such
words
broke
out
beuningen
passionately
it
is
so
obvious
did
you
hear
that
leerdam
and
knotsenbourg
swartenluis
and
many
smaller
places
have
fallen
i
know
i
know
well
bentinck
asked
i
still
have
in
what
in
the
bentinck
smiled
rather
grimly
the
prince
is
another
matter
he
is
not
involved
in
the
ruin
of
the
beuningen
glanced
at
him
quickly
mynheer
he
said
in
an
agitated
voice
you
are
his
highness
friend
tell
me
in
god
s
name
has
he
a
mind
to
sell
us
to
the
french
why
you
speak
the
matter
is
not
one
for
fair
bentinck
knocked
with
his
cane
at
the
heavy
heads
of
the
pinks
along
the
walk
i
am
not
free
to
say
anything
of
the
prince
mynheer
but
i
will
tell
you
this
his
highness
is
in
no
way
bound
to
the
states
who
have
kept
his
rights
from
him
and
treated
him
with
suspicion
and
distrust
for
twenty
you
justify
his
acceptance
of
overtures
from
the
king
of
france
i
say
he
is
not
bound
by
any
law
to
refuse
by
your
leave
mynheer
answered
beuningen
the
laws
of
god
forbid
a
man
to
sell
his
the
laws
of
god
smiled
bentinck
vary
according
to
the
interpreter
and
i
think
mynheer
that
there
will
be
very
little
of
the
united
provinces
left
for
any
one
to
either
buy
or
beuningen
uttered
a
little
sound
of
desperation
the
prince
s
friend
watched
him
with
some
malice
for
he
had
been
of
the
republican
party
in
the
days
of
the
glory
of
john
de
witt
what
is
it
like
at
the
hague
asked
bentinck
they
halted
by
the
gate
and
looked
over
the
neat
painted
paling
towards
the
camp
it
is
naught
but
wrath
and
anguish
answered
beuningen
with
emotion
m
de
witt
hath
but
recovered
from
a
raging
fever
to
find
himself
execrated
he
hath
written
a
justification
of
himself
about
the
secret
service
money
and
the
ill
supplying
of
the
army
but
who
will
listen
to
sober
reason
and
the
peace
proposals
please
no
one
coenraad
beuningen
replied
hotly
they
are
insolent
impossible
when
de
groot
read
them
to
the
states
many
wept
and
wrung
their
they
have
asked
five
days
in
which
to
consider
he
paused
a
moment
then
added
the
shops
are
closed
all
business
suspended
this
week
they
did
not
print
the
binnenhof
is
besieged
with
angry
people
one
feeling
appears
to
warm
them
against
the
chill
of
despair
and
that
is
the
firmness
of
the
these
things
point
to
a
revolution
from
within
even
if
we
escape
conquest
the
prince
hath
always
had
the
people
and
now
they
believe
he
can
save
them
do
they
believe
asked
bentinck
that
by
making
him
stadtholder
they
will
mollify
charles
into
breaking
with
louis
some
may
i
do
nor
i
admitted
bentinck
the
states
continued
beuningen
are
further
divided
among
themselves
many
are
for
accepting
the
terms
as
they
stand
fagel
says
he
would
sooner
be
cut
to
pieces
than
subscribe
to
jacob
van
der
graef
was
executed
yesterday
the
crowd
tried
to
rescue
him
he
confessed
to
the
attack
on
de
witt
and
expressed
his
repentance
and
named
his
accomplices
commented
bentinck
who
have
escaped
they
are
in
the
camp
the
states
i
know
the
states
wrote
to
his
highness
requesting
that
the
men
be
delivered
up
the
prince
had
other
business
to
attend
to
than
making
a
search
for
obscure
what
of
de
montbas
asked
beuningen
he
was
found
guilty
and
banished
for
fifteen
years
the
prince
told
them
to
reconsider
the
sentence
not
finding
it
severe
enough
that
shows
his
highness
hates
a
traitor
or
a
the
two
men
fell
into
silence
their
gaze
still
upon
the
tents
close
by
the
soldiers
had
built
fires
between
bricks
and
in
a
raised
were
cooking
meat
the
sun
darted
a
long
ray
through
the
clouds
and
sparkled
on
the
distant
rhine
a
white
butterfly
fluttered
up
from
the
garden
and
flew
over
the
tents
a
horseman
rode
up
flung
the
reins
to
his
servant
and
dismounted
at
the
farmhouse
gate
it
was
the
prince
bentinck
and
beuningen
stood
aside
come
into
the
house
said
the
captain
general
abruptly
when
they
had
followed
him
into
the
hall
he
spoke
again
the
english
envoys
have
arrived
i
am
to
see
them
now
mynheer
van
beuningen
you
come
from
the
hague
i
will
speak
with
you
leaving
the
messenger
of
the
states
standing
under
the
mirror
the
first
thing
to
be
found
in
all
dutch
houses
so
that
the
visitor
might
find
his
own
image
before
anything
the
prince
turned
to
the
room
to
the
left
followed
by
william
bentinck
it
was
a
small
chamber
of
dark
wood
plainly
furnished
the
table
covered
with
dispatches
the
prince
went
to
the
window
and
opened
it
the
fever
that
he
had
recovered
from
as
by
a
miracle
returned
at
intervals
and
had
greatly
aggravated
his
asthmatic
cough
he
was
shivering
now
though
the
weather
was
oppressively
hot
he
returned
to
the
table
and
spoke
to
bentinck
i
have
heard
from
sir
favourable
news
sir
king
louis
is
resolved
to
ruin
the
states
but
is
wholly
friendly
to
me
de
louvois
said
the
english
asked
too
much
and
were
not
in
a
condition
to
put
forward
such
terms
as
his
master
so
they
quarrel
already
over
the
he
coughed
and
seated
himself
at
the
table
i
have
other
news
he
said
in
the
same
even
tones
laying
his
letters
down
nymwegen
has
sir
yesterday
continued
william
we
have
come
to
a
bitter
pass
m
fagel
writes
there
is
fierce
dissension
at
the
we
will
see
what
these
english
have
to
they
are
in
the
camp
now
count
struym
conducts
them
here
answered
william
he
took
off
his
mantle
and
leant
back
in
his
chair
he
looked
ill
and
coughed
continually
bentinck
regarded
him
curiously
he
rather
wondered
what
the
prince
was
going
to
say
to
these
english
the
situation
was
so
desperate
that
any
terms
offered
were
almost
bound
to
be
accepted
but
william
bentinck
could
not
think
of
the
prince
as
submitting
to
either
england
or
france
suddenly
william
broke
out
did
you
hear
the
terms
de
groot
obtained
outrageous
insolence
does
he
think
we
will
be
content
to
be
slaves
but
they
brought
it
on
themselves
by
sending
a
crawling
embassy
of
do
you
imagine
the
english
will
be
more
reasonable
highness
i
think
they
come
to
confirm
their
alliance
with
france
not
to
obtain
justice
for
will
you
see
them
alone
highness
no
you
remain
the
prince
spoke
in
a
gasping
way
and
held
his
hand
to
his
side
the
room
was
full
of
hot
air
from
the
and
the
smell
of
the
cooking
william
rose
and
closed
the
window
again
and
as
he
was
returning
to
his
chair
the
english
envoys
entered
preceded
by
count
struym
there
was
a
second
s
pause
of
curiosity
on
either
side
william
saw
two
splendidly
dressed
gentlemen
who
carried
themselves
with
an
air
of
pride
and
grandeur
both
tall
handsome
and
decked
out
in
the
extreme
of
fashion
their
persons
he
remembered
perfectly
well
the
earl
of
arlington
quiet
in
manner
of
a
placid
countenance
dark
ringlets
and
moustaches
his
carriage
fine
but
rather
stout
richly
habited
now
in
black
velvet
and
gold
brocade
scarlet
feathers
in
his
hat
and
wearing
a
collar
of
jewels
my
lord
buckingham
once
the
most
beautiful
person
that
ever
graced
a
european
court
but
now
over
florid
and
heavy
his
face
suffused
and
lined
but
still
with
the
manner
of
his
youth
and
gorgeously
attired
in
white
cut
velvet
his
blonde
hair
elaborately
curled
his
blue
mantle
starred
with
silver
every
detail
of
his
attire
sumptuous
and
costly
on
their
part
the
englishmen
beheld
a
slight
youth
of
the
middle
height
with
a
thin
face
an
arched
nose
curved
lips
set
disdainfully
and
deep
and
powerful
eyes
wearing
plain
armour
and
leather
gloves
and
a
linen
cravat
the
envoys
swept
off
their
hats
and
bowed
very
low
then
buckingham
held
his
beaver
against
his
breast
and
looked
at
his
companion
over
the
curling
feathers
i
must
receive
you
very
simply
my
lords
said
the
prince
in
english
as
count
struym
withdrew
i
think
that
we
have
chairs
though
little
i
am
sorry
answered
my
lord
arlington
to
meet
your
highness
again
in
this
and
i
said
the
duke
seating
himself
grandly
am
pleased
to
see
your
highness
again
under
any
william
gave
him
a
quick
look
then
addressed
himself
to
the
earl
this
is
my
lord
bentinck
he
is
entirely
in
my
the
two
noblemen
bowed
bentinck
knew
some
english
but
did
not
trust
himself
to
speak
it
the
prince
seated
himself
he
still
wore
his
hat
that
shaded
his
pale
face
and
heavy
brown
hair
the
duke
filling
the
room
with
perfume
splendour
and
dazzlement
sat
erect
his
right
hand
on
his
gold
cane
the
hazy
sunlight
winking
in
his
jewels
william
glanced
keenly
from
one
to
the
other
my
lord
halifax
he
questioned
is
following
your
highness
he
was
too
late
to
accompany
of
the
three
it
was
lord
halifax
whom
william
preferred
your
highness
continued
arlington
we
have
to
put
before
you
the
terms
of
the
king
our
and
i
my
lord
have
some
reproaches
to
make
on
the
manner
in
which
his
majesty
has
forsaken
the
triple
it
is
to
satisfy
your
highness
on
that
matter
that
we
are
now
here
the
duke
interrupted
shall
we
to
business
if
you
please
my
lord
answered
william
not
looking
at
him
your
highness
is
not
too
fatigued
asked
buckingham
who
would
sooner
have
gone
to
his
supper
first
an
it
please
you
i
will
hear
you
now
replied
the
prince
the
earl
was
drawing
off
his
gloves
you
must
not
confuse
the
king
s
action
against
the
states
with
his
feelings
towards
yourself
highness
he
said
yet
i
must
exclaim
against
my
uncle
for
this
sir
i
assure
you
he
would
never
have
undertaken
it
had
he
not
seen
your
account
very
the
young
general
lowered
his
eyes
in
the
war
my
lord
yes
it
was
always
his
majesty
s
intention
to
avenge
the
of
your
highness
by
the
states
replied
arlington
and
this
war
may
be
much
to
your
william
looked
up
my
lord
i
can
not
discuss
the
matter
from
that
i
speak
as
the
general
of
the
forces
of
the
united
buckingham
smiled
it
is
an
army
almost
your
highness
he
said
the
prince
slightly
flushed
my
lord
i
do
not
admit
that
i
am
expecting
help
from
brandenburg
and
i
trust
that
they
will
not
be
needed
highness
replied
arlington
peace
we
hope
will
render
them
i
do
hope
my
lord
an
honourable
peace
may
be
come
by
but
the
terms
the
king
of
france
offers
are
not
to
be
considered
yet
those
in
desperate
straits
can
scarce
be
choosers
answered
buckingham
we
have
not
come
to
desperation
my
lord
the
emperor
alone
is
sending
me
fifteen
thousand
the
duke
shrugged
his
shoulders
your
highness
has
heard
of
the
fall
of
nymwegen
yes
my
lord
answered
william
composedly
but
we
have
not
the
losses
of
the
campaign
under
discussion
but
the
exorbitance
of
the
demands
of
the
second
is
the
result
of
the
first
highness
the
king
of
france
is
in
a
position
to
make
these
and
we
returned
the
prince
are
in
a
condition
to
refuse
your
highness
speaks
i
would
not
have
my
words
bolder
than
my
actions
i
am
prepared
to
stand
by
what
i
buckingham
answered
sir
what
terms
do
you
object
to
william
fixed
his
eyes
on
him
my
lord
to
all
of
de
groot
offered
the
king
of
france
maestricht
and
the
towns
on
the
border
such
as
breda
and
hertogenbosch
and
in
this
i
think
he
exceeded
his
his
majesty
rejected
these
terms
haughtily
commented
arlington
the
prince
glanced
at
him
gravely
the
king
of
france
s
demands
are
these
that
the
frontiers
of
the
republic
be
withdrawn
to
the
river
leek
leaving
in
his
hands
guelders
overyssel
utrecht
and
brabant
delfzyl
and
its
dependencies
which
are
my
lords
the
keys
of
groningen
the
free
exercise
of
the
romish
faith
in
the
states
the
revocation
of
all
edicts
detrimental
to
french
commerce
the
rights
of
our
east
india
company
waived
in
favour
of
his
a
tribute
of
florins
and
lastly
sir
to
complete
the
humiliation
of
the
states
he
demands
that
a
formal
embassy
be
sent
every
year
to
do
homage
to
him
and
thank
him
for
having
left
us
so
well
answered
buckingham
the
terms
of
a
conqueror
your
highness
and
what
avails
it
to
complain
when
there
is
no
alternative
arlington
replied
more
gently
we
will
endeavour
sir
to
soften
these
william
looked
from
one
to
another
i
think
these
terms
are
of
de
louvois
suggestion
they
will
prove
the
worst
piece
of
policy
he
ever
set
his
hand
to
if
he
had
taken
de
groot
s
terms
he
had
had
a
great
advantage
but
now
he
will
obtain
the
two
envoys
exchanged
a
glance
sir
said
the
earl
you
confuse
yourself
with
the
states
this
does
not
ruin
william
coughed
and
drew
a
painful
breath
what
does
my
uncle
desire
of
the
states
he
asked
quietly
i
have
the
heads
of
his
majesty
s
demands
in
my
mind
highness
answered
arlington
firstly
the
right
of
the
flag
and
a
yearly
rent
for
the
herring
fisheries
a
year
or
less
secondly
the
expenses
of
the
war
fixed
at
to
be
paid
in
next
october
thirdly
three
or
four
towns
as
hostages
flushing
sluys
the
brill
or
the
states
will
never
agree
to
those
terms
nor
could
i
in
conscience
advise
them
to
answered
william
firmly
arlington
was
suave
they
might
be
moderated
buckingham
interrupted
why
by
god
is
france
to
get
all
and
england
nothing
the
prince
bit
his
lip
with
the
effort
to
keep
back
a
violent
answer
my
lords
he
said
in
a
low
voice
i
have
no
power
to
treat
with
you
save
as
general
of
the
states
and
with
the
object
to
detach
you
from
the
french
alliance
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
to
the
advantage
of
england
to
see
the
republic
in
the
hands
of
france
and
it
is
my
aim
to
separate
you
from
your
again
the
envoys
looked
at
each
other
both
trained
in
small
dissimulation
neither
great
enough
statesmen
to
know
that
candour
is
often
more
effective
than
deception
they
regarded
this
statement
as
boyish
simplicity
it
emboldened
arlington
to
bring
out
his
trump
card
to
return
to
the
terms
of
france
sir
interrupted
the
prince
talk
no
more
of
them
we
would
sooner
die
a
thousand
deaths
than
submit
to
i
will
take
it
upon
me
answered
the
earl
to
moderate
them
so
that
we
find
our
account
in
the
adjustment
but
we
must
have
the
cautionary
i
am
confident
the
states
will
never
give
them
returned
william
buckingham
rose
suddenly
and
came
to
the
table
there
is
somewhat
else
to
add
he
said
with
his
air
of
insolence
you
will
not
lose
by
this
arlington
took
it
up
this
in
confidence
between
us
so
you
cede
these
terms
his
majesty
will
make
you
greater
than
any
of
your
house
have
is
that
in
your
instructions
asked
william
quietly
it
is
a
point
his
majesty
made
with
the
king
of
france
answered
arlington
eagerly
if
you
make
this
peace
not
only
will
the
war
be
removed
from
your
country
but
you
will
be
made
sovereign
of
it
and
both
the
kings
will
secure
you
at
home
and
abroad
for
their
majesties
agree
to
make
this
a
condition
of
peace
with
the
states
that
they
take
you
for
king
over
such
of
the
low
countries
as
be
left
after
we
have
had
our
william
kept
his
eyes
lowered
and
leant
a
little
sideways
over
the
arm
of
the
chair
ye
were
to
make
this
proposal
to
me
he
asked
my
lord
buckingham
put
the
matter
more
bluntly
we
are
to
offer
you
the
hereditary
sovereignty
of
the
united
provinces
sir
if
you
will
give
up
to
the
king
of
england
the
towns
he
demands
from
the
states
forbear
to
contest
the
conquests
of
the
french
and
place
in
king
louis
hands
those
remaining
towns
he
has
not
yet
for
the
first
time
since
the
interview
william
looked
at
bentinck
who
stood
motionless
by
the
window
sir
said
my
lord
arlington
do
you
hesitate
you
will
be
a
sovereign
i
like
better
replied
william
the
condition
i
am
in
of
captain
general
of
the
united
it
is
to
your
interest
said
buckingham
strongly
to
take
this
william
gave
him
a
proud
look
maybe
sir
he
replied
but
i
believe
myself
in
honour
and
in
conscience
bound
not
to
prefer
my
interest
before
my
my
lord
laughed
half
wearily
honour
and
conscience
he
repeated
it
is
strange
diplomacy
that
quotes
they
are
things
answered
the
prince
that
i
have
some
regard
for
my
lord
arlington
interposed
i
think
you
are
ambitious
this
offer
may
well
rouse
your
hopes
of
glory
louis
ranks
offer
many
chances
you
will
be
protected
by
the
two
most
powerful
kings
in
the
william
put
his
hand
to
his
forehead
did
you
come
to
bait
me
with
these
prospects
my
lords
or
to
treat
for
an
honourable
peace
this
is
a
peace
wholly
advantageous
to
me
my
lord
not
to
the
buckingham
was
contemptuous
the
states
do
they
any
longer
exist
a
handful
of
traders
always
opposed
to
your
i
must
not
remember
that
now
sir
for
i
am
entrusted
with
their
sole
why
the
better
for
you
since
you
have
your
revenge
put
into
your
the
prince
narrowed
his
eyes
on
him
i
am
dutch
my
buckingham
accepted
the
rebuke
with
a
shrug
you
are
king
louis
cousin
highness
and
king
charles
but
i
am
neither
stewart
nor
bourbon
my
lord
but
of
my
father
s
the
envoys
were
silent
a
while
they
had
bartered
away
their
own
honour
so
long
ago
that
they
had
forgotten
they
had
ever
had
any
they
were
clever
at
overcoming
scruples
but
a
firm
attitude
of
cold
honesty
bewildered
them
both
it
roused
too
my
lord
buckingham
s
sneers
he
let
his
glance
run
with
a
galling
look
of
mockery
over
the
young
man
who
presumed
to
have
a
conscience
if
you
refuse
these
offers
what
other
course
have
you
open
to
you
he
asked
in
whom
will
you
trust
william
looked
at
him
straightly
in
god
echoed
my
lord
with
a
jesting
accent
of
sarcasm
the
prince
flushed
he
is
not
dead
because
ye
have
forgotten
him
at
whitehall
my
i
perceive
that
your
highness
is
a
fanatic
sneered
buckingham
i
am
a
calvinist
returned
the
prince
and
i
take
such
comfort
in
my
faith
that
no
mocks
can
touch
the
duke
smiled
at
arlington
what
have
we
here
he
asked
this
would
sound
like
tom
o
bedlam
in
london
if
your
highness
is
to
talk
like
a
country
parson
i
am
the
earl
spoke
i
must
entreat
your
highness
to
consult
your
advisers
on
what
we
have
said
this
matter
may
not
be
decided
william
rose
and
held
on
to
the
back
of
his
chair
it
may
be
decided
in
a
breath
my
he
addressed
himself
to
arlington
and
had
his
back
half
turned
to
the
duke
but
the
terms
of
peace
i
will
appeal
to
you
to
consider
those
in
the
name
of
wisdom
of
generosity
of
policy
my
lord
offer
us
terms
we
can
with
honour
arlington
rose
sir
if
you
prove
not
tractable
in
this
matter
we
must
go
to
the
french
and
i
have
small
hopes
of
concessions
from
i
beseech
you
to
try
your
best
my
i
shall
always
be
mindful
of
your
highness
if
your
highness
is
mindful
of
them
yourself
added
buckingham
william
took
no
heed
of
him
my
lord
he
continued
to
arlington
i
should
wish
you
to
see
some
of
the
states
beuningen
is
with
me
we
will
approach
this
matter
after
highness
answered
the
earl
i
would
warn
you
at
the
present
juncture
to
make
no
mention
to
the
states
of
the
offer
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
i
will
make
no
promise
said
william
who
being
jealous
of
his
word
was
always
loath
to
bind
himself
i
must
say
what
i
think
fit
my
it
is
for
your
own
good
we
give
the
caution
advised
buckingham
arrogantly
again
the
prince
ignored
him
count
struym
has
found
accommodation
for
you
my
lord
he
told
arlington
i
will
see
you
at
it
were
better
perhaps
we
considered
privately
before
we
said
anything
further
in
this
the
english
deputies
departed
leaving
the
prince
very
pale
very
composed
standing
by
his
chair
in
the
modest
room
and
william
bentinck
silent
against
the
here
s
a
proud
piece
said
buckingham
as
he
flaunted
out
into
the
twilight
here
s
a
to
do
over
a
few
miles
of
marsh
he
was
in
truth
deeply
mortified
by
the
prince
s
cold
reception
wait
until
he
has
seen
his
advisers
he
will
subscribe
to
our
proposals
yet
answered
arlington
himself
disappointed
what
prince
of
ever
preferred
his
country
to
his
interests
besides
besides
he
hath
no
alternative
added
buckingham
and
must
know
it
this
is
but
playing
with
us
to
enhance
his
own
value
wait
till
my
lord
you
will
see
me
prove
myself
a
pretty
chapter
iii
the
answer
william
bentinck
carrying
a
candle
went
up
the
narrow
polished
stairs
to
the
prince
s
apartment
it
was
between
four
and
five
of
the
morning
within
the
house
still
quite
dark
and
silent
at
last
the
conference
with
the
english
commissioners
had
been
opened
again
after
supper
and
continued
till
long
past
midnight
van
beuningen
had
talked
on
the
folly
of
the
alliance
adorning
his
speech
with
scriptural
quotations
illustrations
drawn
from
his
vast
learning
and
a
copiousness
of
logic
until
arlington
had
grown
restive
and
buckingham
blasphemous
but
his
arguments
were
not
without
effect
the
duke
who
had
drunk
heavily
swore
at
last
he
was
in
the
right
and
had
almost
offered
to
sign
a
treaty
with
the
states
when
my
lord
arlington
who
was
a
moderate
man
at
table
restrained
him
beverningh
who
had
taken
at
least
enough
wine
for
volubility
declaimed
loudly
against
the
injustice
of
the
demands
made
by
charles
and
louis
buckingham
became
noisy
offending
the
prince
with
his
swearing
and
profanity
and
refused
to
abate
his
terms
repeating
that
france
should
not
have
everything
and
england
nothing
arlington
grave
but
weak
and
unscrupulous
was
more
reasonable
he
promised
though
not
very
confidently
to
endeavour
to
moderate
louis
preposterous
demands
he
insisted
however
on
the
cautionary
towns
as
he
termed
them
for
charles
on
this
point
the
dutch
deputies
were
firm
they
would
not
place
an
inch
of
their
territory
in
the
hands
of
france
or
england
beyond
the
border
towns
such
as
maestricht
with
which
william
had
already
asked
the
allies
to
content
themselves
buckingham
speaking
violently
argued
that
it
was
absurd
to
offer
a
king
a
few
towns
in
exchange
for
three
provinces
he
had
already
conquered
and
three
more
that
he
was
prepared
to
conquer
and
hinted
that
the
dutch
were
in
no
condition
to
argue
about
terms
at
all
but
must
take
thankfully
what
was
given
them
and
this
in
face
of
it
that
a
while
before
he
had
been
offering
to
sign
an
alliance
with
them
so
veering
and
unstable
he
embarrassed
the
discussion
with
constant
changes
of
opinion
and
capricious
arguments
based
upon
neither
justice
nor
reason
for
his
part
the
prince
appealed
to
england
s
ancient
friendship
to
the
principles
of
the
triple
alliance
to
his
uncle
s
protestations
to
the
unwisdom
of
allowing
the
french
to
upset
the
balance
of
power
in
europe
and
to
the
one
religion
common
to
england
and
the
united
provinces
threatened
by
the
encroachments
of
louis
but
this
policy
was
too
too
slow
and
too
lofty
to
appeal
to
men
eager
for
immediate
gain
and
applause
indifferent
to
their
country
s
ultimate
good
only
vaguely
concerned
even
for
her
present
glory
and
absorbed
purely
in
their
own
selfish
interests
that
lay
entirely
with
france
arranging
for
another
private
interview
with
the
prince
in
the
morning
the
commissioners
and
the
deputies
separated
after
hours
of
talk
nothing
had
been
conceded
one
side
or
the
other
the
english
refusing
to
abate
their
terms
and
the
dutch
resolved
not
to
accept
them
william
bentinck
who
had
listened
eagerly
but
said
very
little
had
decided
privately
that
the
prince
could
and
must
do
no
other
than
come
separately
to
terms
with
the
envoys
on
the
basis
of
a
secret
arrangement
such
as
they
had
themselves
offered
and
urged
excited
and
unable
to
sleep
on
the
hard
settle
that
was
his
only
bed
since
an
english
gentleman
had
his
room
bentinck
determined
to
consult
with
the
prince
william
had
desired
to
be
roused
early
to
allow
himself
time
before
his
final
interview
with
the
english
commissioners
but
bentinck
discovered
that
he
had
not
been
to
bed
at
all
but
was
sitting
fully
dressed
by
the
open
window
ah
you
he
said
affectionately
i
am
glad
to
see
bentinck
placed
the
candle
beside
the
one
already
on
the
mantelshelf
and
i
am
sorry
you
have
not
been
asleep
have
you
smiled
the
prince
no
but
it
was
not
my
whose
then
the
hardness
and
narrowness
of
the
settle
highness
which
was
as
unyielding
as
the
english
the
prince
rose
you
had
been
welcome
to
mine
bentinck
i
could
not
sleep
the
arguments
of
buckingham
and
beuningen
buzz
too
much
in
your
ears
m
beuningen
is
an
immoderate
talker
answered
william
i
think
he
spoke
too
long
m
buckingham
thought
so
oh
he
said
the
prince
impatiently
half
the
time
he
was
not
none
the
easier
to
deal
with
for
m
beverningh
also
added
william
with
an
air
of
disgust
hath
the
vice
of
drinking
too
bentinck
smiled
it
makes
him
the
prince
stood
at
the
window
in
a
weary
attitude
what
hour
is
it
not
yet
five
william
spoke
abruptly
bentinck
they
are
going
to
repeat
their
offer
to
his
friend
looked
at
him
i
think
so
they
advised
me
to
consult
some
one
that
i
had
trust
you
have
spoken
to
beuningen
my
faith
exclaimed
bentinck
there
is
little
to
consult
for
a
moment
william
was
silent
then
he
said
looking
out
of
the
window
m
fagel
writes
to
me
that
i
alone
keep
the
people
from
my
name
they
begin
to
repent
their
ingratitude
the
country
is
without
a
head
since
the
illness
of
de
witt
if
they
should
turn
to
me
i
think
they
may
and
offer
me
the
stadtholdership
now
that
it
is
not
worthless
said
william
at
least
not
what
the
french
and
english
can
offer
the
prince
gave
him
a
strange
almost
a
wistful
glance
oh
this
is
a
little
age
he
said
wearily
of
such
little
men
i
but
he
turned
his
gaze
over
his
camp
spread
beneath
the
gold
and
silver
dawn
perhaps
some
men
could
have
done
better
he
said
i
would
i
could
have
served
one
campaign
condé
before
i
had
to
serve
against
him
yet
against
all
odds
something
may
be
bentinck
stared
at
him
you
do
not
seriously
think
of
resistance
highness
would
you
consider
it
madness
asked
william
the
most
utter
madness
bentinck
was
vehement
the
country
is
lost
half
conquered
wholly
despaired
of
nothing
will
soften
king
louis
demands
you
must
see
william
turned
towards
the
room
and
seated
himself
in
the
chair
by
the
hearth
and
if
i
pitted
myself
against
louis
he
queried
it
would
be
as
if
a
child
should
set
itself
to
stem
a
river
with
its
unaided
hands
finished
william
grimly
bentinck
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
would
be
an
impossibility
there
is
no
one
in
europe
to
stand
against
louis
one
might
england
is
his
ally
the
empire
afraid
the
rest
of
europe
overawed
one
might
rouse
it
would
be
a
task
well
i
call
it
william
coughed
and
fixed
his
bright
eyes
on
the
empty
hearth
you
are
weary
said
bentinck
tenderly
coming
nearer
i
am
very
weary
and
sick
answered
the
prince
faintly
in
body
and
soul
william
i
can
get
no
rest
at
times
despair
can
not
be
always
held
at
bay
my
head
hath
a
horrible
inclination
to
ache
and
i
think
i
have
the
fever
still
yet
it
will
pass
i
pray
you
do
not
notice
console
yourself
sir
that
your
prospects
are
more
hopeful
than
for
some
the
prince
made
no
answer
and
bentinck
regarded
him
anxiously
i
would
have
you
consider
well
what
you
say
to
these
envoys
he
added
earnestly
your
terms
will
never
be
listened
to
louis
is
a
by
making
yourself
king
of
holland
you
save
it
and
revenge
yourself
on
the
i
have
considered
that
answered
the
prince
well
returned
bentinck
you
have
always
been
reserved
even
with
me
highness
and
you
take
advice
of
no
man
but
i
make
bold
to
tell
you
that
only
a
foolish
mind
would
refuse
these
offers
the
french
and
english
make
again
william
was
silent
his
attitude
was
one
of
utter
exhaustion
he
continually
coughed
and
shivered
you
can
not
stand
the
occupation
of
war
said
william
bentinck
if
you
would
not
kill
yourself
you
must
make
peace
the
prince
roused
himself
and
sat
up
will
you
wait
on
the
english
bentinck
presently
and
tell
them
i
will
receive
them
here
as
soon
as
they
wish
bentinck
understood
his
dismissal
in
this
and
felt
offended
once
more
he
proved
the
uselessness
of
any
attempt
on
his
part
to
offer
advice
to
his
master
he
put
out
the
needless
candles
for
the
small
room
was
filled
with
the
glitter
of
the
sun
and
left
without
further
speech
william
sat
quite
still
gazing
at
the
homely
tiles
with
their
little
rural
scenes
in
blue
on
a
yellow
ground
a
cow
a
milkmaid
a
windmill
a
barge
a
dog
a
man
and
a
woman
skating
the
languor
of
fatigue
and
pain
made
him
sit
heavily
and
droopingly
his
head
supported
in
his
right
hand
the
childhood
he
had
scarcely
left
behind
rose
in
his
memory
one
incident
after
another
back
to
the
early
years
when
his
mother
had
taught
him
he
was
of
the
proudest
blood
in
the
he
looked
back
on
the
loneliness
the
dreariness
the
rankling
and
constant
sense
of
humiliation
the
illnesses
the
hunts
in
guelders
the
bitterness
of
having
to
part
with
de
zuylestein
the
espionage
of
the
republicans
the
lofty
governorship
of
de
witt
the
perpetual
feeling
of
injustice
and
restraint
the
agony
of
having
to
take
quietly
treatment
his
imperious
nature
longed
to
spurn
the
overtures
from
de
pomponne
first
insinuating
to
him
that
he
could
revenge
himself
by
leaguing
with
louis
the
visits
of
sir
william
temple
so
different
from
the
others
treating
him
with
homage
as
a
grandchild
of
england
the
long
hours
of
arduous
study
followed
by
blinding
headaches
the
quiet
sundays
with
the
lengthy
sermons
in
the
groote
kerk
all
his
training
teaching
him
to
be
reserved
cautious
and
to
conceal
his
quick
passions
under
an
unreadable
exterior
he
had
never
been
happy
often
utterly
dreary
dispirited
and
he
remembered
his
recent
entry
into
middelburg
as
the
fairest
episode
for
the
rest
he
shuddered
at
the
recollection
of
the
slights
rebuffs
reprimands
loneliness
disputes
illnesses
and
neglects
that
made
up
the
sum
of
his
life
with
a
little
broken
sigh
he
moved
at
last
and
slowly
rose
his
cuirass
and
his
sword
lay
on
the
ground
beside
his
bed
he
picked
up
the
weapon
buckled
it
on
and
went
languidly
downstairs
the
small
farm
was
full
of
young
dutch
noblemen
and
the
english
forming
the
train
of
the
envoys
avoiding
these
he
entered
the
little
front
room
where
the
previous
day
he
had
received
the
commissioners
half
an
hour
later
beuningen
found
him
there
breakfasting
alone
on
brown
bread
radishes
and
cock
ale
and
making
notes
on
a
slip
of
paper
highness
began
coenraad
beuningen
william
looked
up
gravely
ah
have
you
had
breakfast
mynheer
not
well
will
you
share
mine
the
prince
drew
forward
a
chair
beuningen
seated
himself
murmuring
thanks
he
looked
agitated
and
overwrought
his
handsome
eyes
were
red
his
dress
dishevelled
the
prince
folded
up
his
paper
and
placed
it
in
his
pocket
he
had
changed
his
suit
and
wore
a
velvet
very
plain
and
a
black
sash
i
have
made
some
notes
on
the
converse
of
last
night
he
remarked
beuningen
poured
out
the
ale
from
the
silver
jug
your
highness
has
to
see
the
envoys
again
he
inquired
in
a
humble
way
this
morning
yes
answered
william
before
they
leave
for
he
leant
back
and
looked
full
at
his
companion
with
a
penetrating
and
almost
smiling
glance
beuningen
set
his
tankard
down
we
have
gained
little
good
by
this
conference
he
said
distractedly
william
was
silent
beuningen
crumbled
his
bread
on
the
table
your
highness
he
said
desperately
i
have
been
thinking
all
night
this
wretched
o
god
my
a
light
flashed
into
william
s
eyes
but
still
he
said
nothing
beuningen
pushed
back
his
chair
he
could
hardly
control
his
features
and
his
voice
i
must
appeal
to
your
highness
in
the
name
of
the
states
he
said
thickly
for
we
have
no
hope
but
in
what
do
you
mean
my
lord
asked
william
softly
coenraad
beuningen
rose
i
think
these
men
have
made
private
overtures
to
your
highness
he
answered
and
you
are
free
to
take
them
but
have
pity
on
the
he
clasped
his
hand
passionately
over
his
heart
to
such
wretched
straits
are
we
ah
they
tempted
your
ambition
i
doubt
not
but
if
your
highness
would
be
truly
great
save
the
united
do
you
believe
i
could
asked
the
prince
breathlessly
before
god
i
believe
your
highness
an
extraordinary
change
came
over
the
prince
s
face
he
replied
with
vivacity
m
van
beuningen
you
have
been
a
good
republican
i
will
forgive
it
you
for
i
have
been
opposed
to
your
highness
said
beuningen
but
the
time
of
party
is
over
i
can
see
only
that
the
country
is
conquered
ruined
and
that
our
one
hope
is
in
the
courage
and
firmness
of
your
he
went
restlessly
to
the
window
and
put
his
hand
before
his
eyes
william
gazed
at
him
still
with
that
expression
of
animation
and
pleasure
you
must
not
despair
mynheer
he
said
gently
too
many
i
shall
not
if
your
highness
does
not
forsake
the
prince
rose
what
of
your
former
rulers
he
asked
they
can
do
nothing
with
the
people
de
witt
is
ill
mynheer
answered
william
the
states
dealt
hardly
with
me
i
have
been
virtually
a
prisoner
all
my
life
it
is
strange
they
should
come
to
me
it
may
be
but
your
highness
voice
is
the
only
one
that
can
make
itself
heard
said
beuningen
in
a
tone
of
despair
the
people
will
turn
to
if
in
vain
god
have
mercy
upon
you
credit
me
with
great
do
i
not
hear
it
said
that
the
man
who
pits
himself
against
france
must
be
mad
coenraad
beuningen
looked
round
sharply
or
a
hero
he
said
they
are
rarer
than
madmen
answered
the
prince
your
highness
house
has
been
rich
in
great
william
drew
back
from
the
suspicion
of
flattery
leave
them
mynheer
he
said
coldly
and
picked
up
a
copy
of
that
lay
on
the
table
beuningen
turned
away
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
william
regarded
him
covertly
and
keenly
mynheer
he
said
in
another
tone
beuningen
raised
his
head
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
before
he
could
speak
heenvliet
announced
the
english
envoys
who
were
accompanied
by
bentinck
coenraad
beuningen
gave
the
prince
a
quick
look
bowed
to
the
company
and
left
the
chamber
william
remained
where
he
was
standing
by
the
his
hand
resting
on
the
rail
of
beuningen
s
chair
the
duke
and
flamboyant
trailing
a
purple
velvet
mantle
over
one
shoulder
and
carrying
his
hat
with
long
feathers
seated
himself
without
ado
but
arlington
more
respectful
remained
on
his
feet
i
trust
the
night
has
brought
wisdom
to
your
highness
said
buckingham
swinging
his
embroidered
gloves
by
the
tassels
i
can
only
repeat
the
proposals
i
made
yesterday
replied
the
prince
my
influence
with
the
states
permits
me
to
promise
their
execution
as
to
what
you
propose
my
lords
the
states
will
never
accede
to
such
terms
nor
could
i
advise
them
arlington
answered
with
great
earnestness
the
success
of
his
mission
lay
with
this
attempt
to
gain
the
prince
sir
forget
the
states
awhile
he
said
we
speak
to
you
as
a
prince
of
our
royal
house
to
show
the
consideration
and
friendship
of
his
sir
you
must
believe
that
we
are
cromwell
made
your
exclusion
from
power
a
condition
of
peace
with
the
united
king
charles
will
make
your
restoration
a
condition
yea
restoration
to
a
greater
position
than
ever
your
ancestors
william
seated
himself
and
looked
on
the
ground
the
earl
continued
in
his
smooth
pleasant
voice
these
burghers
have
behaved
insolently
to
you
your
highness
it
hath
always
been
his
majesty
s
intention
to
make
them
repent
their
ingratitude
to
your
house
he
now
proves
his
entire
friendship
by
this
offer
which
is
we
repeat
the
sovereignty
of
holland
and
other
lands
in
return
for
your
alliance
with
his
majesty
the
cautionary
towns
and
the
delivery
of
the
remaining
forts
into
the
hands
of
his
majesty
of
the
prince
glanced
up
my
lord
you
had
my
answer
last
i
trust
your
highness
has
considered
since
reflect
added
buckingham
that
resistance
is
useless
by
god
you
must
see
i
see
returned
the
prince
that
you
propose
to
me
an
infamous
arlington
slightly
coloured
but
the
duke
laughed
your
highness
is
very
young
said
the
earl
m
de
witt
has
filled
your
head
with
fantastic
m
de
witt
is
an
honest
man
replied
william
and
a
wise
one
i
learnt
no
folly
from
i
do
not
understand
your
highness
attitude
urged
arlington
our
agents
and
those
of
de
pomponne
assured
you
some
time
since
william
interrupted
my
lord
the
french
have
made
advances
to
me
very
often
they
have
always
been
rejected
i
would
not
owe
my
elevation
in
the
state
to
foreign
intervention
but
to
the
will
of
god
and
the
wish
of
the
arlington
was
nonplussed
your
highness
has
not
learnt
the
language
of
diplomacy
he
said
your
lordship
must
lay
that
to
the
charge
of
my
inexperience
i
am
new
to
affairs
answered
the
prince
proudly
maybe
i
speak
too
bluntly
but
the
meaning
is
the
main
thing
is
it
not
my
lord
buckingham
spoke
now
consider
well
your
meaning
before
you
utter
it
highness
think
of
the
alternative
the
terms
that
you
propose
we
should
not
dare
put
before
de
louvois
i
tell
you
plainly
and
there
is
nothing
before
you
but
a
continuation
of
the
war
that
is
a
continuation
of
the
conquest
of
the
republic
if
you
refuse
us
you
and
the
states
go
to
ruin
together
for
there
is
no
help
for
bentinck
came
anxiously
forward
william
looked
straight
at
the
duke
nevertheless
i
refuse
your
offer
my
buckingham
rose
impatiently
you
do
not
know
what
you
say
have
you
no
ambition
we
offer
you
dominion
william
rose
for
the
first
time
some
agitation
showed
through
the
composure
of
his
manner
you
offer
me
what
i
would
not
stoop
to
pick
up
my
lord
he
answered
i
thought
you
a
prince
desirous
of
reigning
said
arlington
not
at
the
price
of
my
honour
buckingham
struck
his
gloves
across
his
open
palm
whatever
you
do
the
country
is
lost
he
sneered
if
it
be
i
will
not
connive
at
it
replied
the
prince
nor
make
my
profit
out
of
that
the
duke
was
contemptuous
your
highness
dreams
of
resistance
a
second
hannibal
william
coloured
and
breathed
deeply
i
do
think
i
might
do
even
as
he
press
not
the
parallel
too
close
highness
this
is
our
second
punic
war
and
in
a
week
or
so
de
louvois
may
say
delenda
est
rome
fell
also
returned
william
and
in
a
less
noble
fashion
by
her
own
corruption
go
carefully
my
lord
that
the
like
fate
comes
not
on
buckingham
affected
to
laugh
we
get
no
nearer
the
i
must
ask
for
your
highness
final
decision
added
arlington
william
stood
with
his
back
against
the
table
looking
from
one
to
the
other
with
slightly
narrowed
eyes
my
lords
for
what
concerns
me
privately
you
have
had
my
answer
for
what
concerns
their
high
mightinesses
you
must
go
to
the
william
bentinck
murmured
impatiently
i
would
as
lief
that
a
dozen
of
the
states
were
hanged
so
that
the
war
was
taken
out
of
the
country
and
your
highness
king
of
is
that
your
final
decision
asked
arlington
deeply
mortified
yes
replied
the
prince
firmly
and
nothing
will
move
me
my
so
curt
unfaltering
and
stern
were
his
words
that
the
envoys
saw
no
hope
of
persuading
him
they
prepared
to
leave
but
buckingham
was
too
angry
to
go
in
silence
if
you
do
not
put
yourself
wholly
in
the
king
s
hands
you
are
lost
he
declared
if
you
have
any
wisdom
you
will
consider
the
prince
cut
him
short
my
countrymen
he
said
have
trusted
me
and
i
will
never
deceive
nor
betray
them
for
any
base
ends
of
my
buckingham
his
hand
on
the
door
answered
hotly
think
no
more
of
your
country
for
it
no
longer
exists
do
you
not
see
that
it
is
lost
if
it
survive
this
campaign
it
will
be
a
miracle
do
you
not
see
that
it
is
lost
there
is
nothing
before
you
but
despair
you
must
see
your
country
and
again
he
repeated
do
you
not
see
that
it
is
lost
william
s
calm
changed
into
a
passionate
emotion
he
answered
with
an
air
of
exaltation
he
was
so
lifted
up
he
cared
little
for
any
of
them
my
lord
i
indeed
see
that
the
country
is
in
great
danger
but
there
is
one
way
never
to
see
it
lost
and
that
is
to
die
in
the
last
there
was
a
little
pause
arlington
glanced
at
buckingham
and
after
a
second
the
duke
answered
very
well
sir
in
a
short
while
you
will
regret
i
am
sorry
you
are
so
we
shall
have
a
different
reception
at
zeyst
added
the
earl
i
must
warn
your
highness
that
we
shall
there
conclude
a
closer
union
between
england
and
the
rearrangement
of
the
terms
is
between
you
and
the
states
replied
the
prince
as
to
what
touches
me
i
have
he
moved
away
towards
the
hearth
averting
his
face
from
them
the
envoys
bowed
coldly
and
withdrew
both
angry
and
buckingham
at
least
his
enemy
william
bentinck
stared
at
the
door
that
had
closed
after
them
they
have
gone
highness
he
exclaimed
and
in
wrath
you
have
destroyed
your
last
they
are
shallow
men
returned
william
calmly
he
came
back
to
the
table
coughing
a
little
bentinck
appeared
alarmed
and
troubled
you
were
ill
advised
what
have
you
done
he
cried
what
is
to
become
of
us
all
this
is
not
the
language
of
a
friend
returned
the
prince
who
seemed
little
to
heed
the
other
s
exclamations
the
states
may
accept
the
terms
said
bentinck
catching
at
straws
not
if
i
can
prevent
william
bentinck
answered
angrily
sir
you
throw
away
your
own
advantage
wilfully
de
buckingham
was
right
there
is
nothing
but
despair
before
all
of
the
prince
sat
immovable
composed
with
an
absent
look
in
his
eyes
gazing
out
of
the
window
at
the
camp
bentinck
exasperated
went
violently
from
the
room
william
glanced
round
as
the
door
banged
then
sat
still
taking
his
aching
head
in
his
hand
there
was
a
thoughtful
absorbed
expression
on
his
pale
face
a
relaxing
of
the
usual
disdainful
curve
of
his
lips
that
gave
him
an
air
of
gentleness
he
was
not
long
alone
count
struym
and
heenvliet
entered
with
more
eagerness
than
ceremony
sir
said
the
first
gentleman
here
are
two
burgomasters
two
burgher
captains
and
others
come
from
dordt
dordt
repeated
the
prince
this
town
the
residence
of
the
de
witts
had
always
been
considered
particularly
republican
dordt
highness
they
desire
to
see
you
why
for
what
reason
sir
they
are
confused
with
haste
and
agitation
but
i
gather
the
town
is
in
such
a
tumult
none
save
your
highness
can
quell
it
and
to
save
their
own
lives
the
magistrates
have
sent
for
your
william
answered
rather
impatiently
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
journey
to
they
will
not
return
without
i
must
remain
at
my
sir
they
are
afraid
of
being
torn
to
bits
if
they
disappoint
the
people
ah
said
william
sharply
is
it
as
serious
as
that
i
think
it
is
the
signal
for
a
restoration
the
prince
rose
is
it
more
than
a
riot
i
think
so
they
want
me
the
people
want
me
the
burgomasters
say
so
it
seems
they
were
fired
by
the
example
of
ter
veere
which
has
proclaimed
your
highness
stadtholder
with
much
william
flushed
but
ter
veere
is
my
own
you
will
at
least
see
this
deputation
from
dordt
sir
yes
i
will
see
he
had
reassumed
now
his
usual
composure
and
reserve
he
gave
no
sign
that
he
was
moved
yet
it
was
a
triumph
dordt
the
home
of
the
de
witts
had
risen
in
his
favour
bring
the
burghers
here
count
he
said
chapter
iv
the
will
of
the
people
in
the
frantic
state
of
angry
despair
to
which
the
united
provinces
were
reduced
holland
the
proudest
wealthiest
state
was
the
first
to
take
fire
at
the
injuries
inflicted
on
her
and
to
turn
fiercely
on
the
government
that
she
conceived
had
betrayed
her
into
ruin
the
mission
of
de
groot
had
been
vastly
unpopular
the
submission
shown
in
this
embassy
was
looked
upon
as
a
sign
of
degrading
nay
criminal
weakness
and
the
people
violently
accused
their
ministers
of
selling
them
to
the
french
they
reminded
each
other
that
rhynsberg
had
not
had
enough
powder
to
defend
the
counterscarps
that
all
the
saltpetre
belonging
to
the
east
india
company
had
been
allowed
to
be
sold
to
the
french
even
when
war
appeared
inevitable
that
the
land
forces
had
been
greatly
reduced
of
late
that
such
soldiers
as
they
had
were
and
that
tedious
difficulties
had
been
put
in
the
way
of
the
election
of
the
prince
of
orange
to
the
captain
generalship
and
even
now
his
power
was
so
restricted
as
to
be
almost
useless
they
flattered
themselves
that
the
king
of
france
would
not
have
had
such
easy
success
but
for
complicity
on
the
part
of
the
governors
of
the
country
and
all
overtures
of
peace
were
regarded
as
a
final
attempt
to
deliver
them
to
the
enemy
the
idea
of
peace
became
one
with
slavery
and
disgrace
and
the
government
was
regarded
as
vile
and
infamous
in
even
listening
to
louis
terms
and
on
john
de
witt
the
head
of
the
government
and
the
apostle
of
peace
all
rage
and
hate
were
poured
all
the
disasters
of
the
war
were
imputed
to
his
charge
he
was
accused
of
every
crime
frenzy
could
find
a
name
for
and
blamed
bitterly
for
having
so
long
kept
the
prince
out
of
power
and
for
having
clipped
such
authority
as
he
had
been
obliged
to
give
him
on
the
other
hand
the
idea
of
war
and
resistance
was
associated
with
the
image
of
the
young
captain
general
austere
composed
religious
of
the
old
house
the
only
man
who
had
dared
to
show
firmness
in
the
face
of
the
overwhelming
public
misfortunes
he
became
the
idol
of
the
people
who
ran
frantic
in
his
name
at
dordt
they
had
broken
into
open
revolt
on
hearing
of
the
terms
offered
by
france
and
that
the
states
were
considering
them
and
a
rumour
being
abroad
that
their
representatives
had
advocated
peace
a
company
of
burghers
marched
to
the
town
hall
and
demanded
of
the
councillors
if
they
were
prepared
to
defend
the
town
or
if
they
already
negotiated
its
delivery
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
the
magistrates
replied
that
they
would
resist
to
the
utmost
but
did
not
succeed
in
pacifying
the
citizens
who
suspecting
their
republican
sympathies
demanded
permission
to
inspect
the
arsenals
the
keeper
was
absent
the
keys
with
him
this
gave
the
signal
for
a
cry
of
treason
that
was
echoed
throughout
the
town
and
the
subsequent
opening
of
the
magazines
did
not
suffice
to
restore
order
angry
cries
were
started
against
john
de
witt
and
his
followers
the
orange
flag
was
paraded
through
the
streets
with
shouts
for
the
prince
of
orange
the
white
flag
flying
contemptuously
beneath
william
s
colour
the
magistrates
assembled
in
agitation
but
no
concession
would
quiet
the
people
the
burgomaster
not
daring
to
act
without
authority
from
the
government
endeavoured
to
escape
from
the
town
but
was
stopped
in
a
side
street
by
a
workman
armed
with
a
hatchet
who
offered
to
brain
him
if
he
resisted
the
wishes
of
the
populace
in
this
fashion
conducted
back
to
the
town
hall
the
burgomaster
was
forced
to
again
summon
the
councillors
to
consult
on
the
situation
it
was
an
ugly
one
for
them
they
had
sworn
to
maintain
the
perpetual
edict
and
would
have
to
answer
to
the
states
general
if
they
violated
their
oath
on
the
other
hand
they
were
in
immediate
danger
from
the
violence
of
the
people
they
discovered
as
they
thought
an
expedient
to
shift
the
responsibility
and
announced
with
sound
of
trumpets
that
they
would
at
once
send
a
deputation
to
the
prince
begging
him
to
come
immediately
to
dordt
the
town
secretary
orent
muys
two
members
of
the
council
two
burgomasters
two
burgher
captains
and
two
citizens
were
chosen
and
escorted
to
the
gates
by
the
people
shouting
long
live
his
highness
death
to
the
bad
magistrates
down
with
john
de
witt
to
hell
with
the
friends
of
france
all
night
long
the
town
seethed
the
magistrates
trembled
when
they
considered
what
the
outburst
of
fury
would
be
should
the
deputation
return
the
prince
not
with
them
as
soon
as
it
was
light
the
people
were
out
on
the
quays
gazing
down
the
flat
grey
waters
of
the
maas
and
the
merwede
which
stretched
almost
to
the
horizon
where
rotterdam
lay
and
spread
to
right
and
left
encircling
the
town
in
a
belt
of
water
the
burgher
companies
were
up
and
armed
patrolling
the
streets
clattering
their
blunderbusses
under
the
windows
of
cornelius
de
witt
s
house
where
the
ruard
lay
sick
and
shouting
in
insulting
tones
for
the
prince
so
that
he
could
hear
them
in
his
bed
others
amused
themselves
with
breaking
into
the
town
hall
destroying
the
remaining
portraits
of
john
and
cornelius
de
witt
and
savagely
tearing
out
of
its
frame
baan
s
picture
of
the
victory
at
chatham
which
was
dedicated
to
the
glory
of
the
ruard
about
ten
o
clock
the
feeling
rose
to
frenzy
it
became
known
that
the
deputation
had
returned
in
company
with
the
young
prince
the
magistrates
hastened
to
receive
william
who
was
landing
at
the
groothoofd
poort
one
of
the
finest
gates
of
the
wealthy
city
situate
on
the
junction
of
the
merwede
and
the
maas
the
inhabitants
formed
themselves
into
a
guard
of
honour
and
the
prince
was
greeted
by
a
shout
of
pure
wild
joy
the
councillors
including
among
them
jacob
de
beveren
the
of
the
grand
pensionary
greeted
him
humbly
even
kissing
his
hand
one
offered
him
a
coach
william
declined
and
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
the
people
walked
among
them
on
foot
to
the
town
hall
he
was
plainly
dressed
without
armour
wore
only
a
light
sword
and
carried
a
cane
he
kept
his
hat
on
and
took
no
notice
in
his
solemn
entry
of
the
people
or
of
the
councillors
who
accompanied
him
the
distance
was
not
great
between
the
groothoofd
poort
and
the
stadhuis
but
william
as
he
walked
slowly
down
the
wynstraat
had
time
to
observe
both
that
he
could
do
what
he
pleased
with
the
people
and
that
the
magistrates
intended
to
thrust
on
him
all
responsibility
they
followed
him
with
heads
uncovered
but
they
made
no
suggestion
the
enormous
crowd
gathered
as
they
advanced
through
the
groenmarkt
and
considerably
impeded
their
progress
to
the
fine
gothic
stadhuis
the
canals
were
choked
with
boats
laden
with
armed
citizens
and
people
came
crowding
up
from
the
yards
from
the
barges
and
till
the
streets
could
hold
no
more
on
the
stadhuis
steps
william
paused
mynheer
hallingh
he
said
to
the
burgomaster
i
acknowledge
my
reception
but
what
object
do
i
serve
by
entering
your
town
hall
the
burgomaster
bowed
very
low
for
the
eyes
of
thousands
were
on
him
we
hope
your
highness
may
do
us
the
extreme
favour
of
taking
a
seat
in
our
to
what
end
mynheer
asked
william
steadily
beveren
answered
with
his
eye
on
the
expectant
crowd
has
your
highness
any
proposal
to
make
us
the
prince
saw
clearly
by
this
that
they
hoped
to
delude
the
people
by
an
outward
show
of
deference
managing
that
the
prince
should
return
without
any
further
concession
to
their
revolutionary
wishes
on
william
s
part
it
was
not
his
desire
to
put
himself
at
the
head
of
a
mob
and
neither
his
nature
nor
his
policy
to
encourage
sedition
he
was
as
prudent
as
the
councillors
and
as
resolute
not
to
commit
himself
to
their
intention
that
if
there
must
be
a
revolution
it
should
be
laid
to
him
at
the
same
time
he
was
angry
that
they
should
send
for
him
merely
to
fool
the
people
of
dordt
he
answered
with
composure
mynheer
i
must
remind
you
that
i
came
here
at
your
request
your
urgent
request
to
hear
what
you
had
to
say
to
the
councillors
refused
to
be
drawn
with
many
protestations
of
respect
they
invited
him
to
inspect
the
arsenals
and
fortifications
of
the
town
william
looked
at
them
at
bentinck
at
the
crowd
and
he
smiled
he
could
not
help
being
amused
at
the
cunning
with
which
these
republican
magistrates
were
endeavouring
to
keep
the
law
and
please
the
people
very
well
mynheer
he
answered
gravely
i
shall
be
pleased
to
see
your
followed
by
the
eager
crowds
the
prince
set
out
for
the
ramparts
and
the
powder
magazines
beveren
the
husband
of
john
de
witt
s
sister
galled
by
the
position
in
which
he
found
himself
ventured
to
put
on
his
hat
it
was
instantly
knocked
off
with
threats
that
it
would
be
his
head
next
time
if
he
did
not
treat
the
prince
with
proper
respect
william
affected
neither
to
see
nor
hear
he
conversed
with
bentinck
and
occasionally
with
the
burgomaster
his
manner
showing
the
same
calm
as
if
no
mob
clamoured
at
their
heels
he
passed
interested
comments
on
the
beautiful
architecture
of
the
wealthy
town
that
he
had
never
seen
before
outside
the
latin
grammar
school
where
john
de
witt
had
studied
the
history
of
his
country
with
a
joyous
and
ambitious
heart
and
not
far
from
the
house
of
jacob
de
witt
where
the
grand
pensionary
in
the
days
when
he
wore
a
sword
and
had
written
french
verses
to
wendela
van
bicker
the
people
closed
round
the
prince
and
his
escort
and
demanded
that
he
should
not
leave
the
town
until
the
magistrates
had
proclaimed
him
van
beveren
murmured
something
about
the
perpetual
edict
upon
which
one
henry
dibbets
a
calvinist
minister
levelled
a
gun
at
his
head
and
shouted
to
the
prince
that
he
would
soon
have
his
father
s
offices
restored
to
him
the
prince
himself
put
the
musket
aside
my
friends
i
am
content
he
said
gravely
the
burgomaster
thrust
up
against
the
wall
of
the
school
shouted
lustily
long
live
the
prince
but
the
magistrates
still
resolved
not
to
yield
hastily
invited
william
to
a
repast
at
the
peacock
inn
in
truth
said
the
prince
regarding
them
with
smiling
eyes
i
am
a
little
the
angry
crowd
demanded
if
he
had
been
proclaimed
stadtholder
thou
old
fat
villain
cried
henry
dibbets
to
the
burgomaster
thou
art
deceiving
us
hast
thou
brought
the
prince
here
to
walk
him
up
and
down
the
town
he
was
seconded
by
furious
cries
of
knipperdolling
traitor
down
with
the
mm
de
witt
they
swarmed
after
the
prince
to
the
peacock
inn
where
the
frightened
landlord
overwhelmed
at
the
honour
prostrated
himself
before
his
highness
in
the
fine
on
the
ground
floor
a
meal
was
hastily
but
sumptuously
prepared
william
still
wearing
his
hat
took
the
head
of
the
table
the
magistrates
white
and
flustered
seated
themselves
giving
anxious
glances
towards
the
door
and
the
long
windows
that
overlooked
the
street
your
citizens
said
william
to
the
burgomaster
seem
to
be
of
a
noisy
it
was
his
first
allusion
to
the
nature
of
his
reception
they
are
very
fond
of
your
highness
answered
van
hallingh
fatuously
ah
the
prince
spoke
dryly
it
seems
as
if
they
might
be
dangerous
mynheer
to
any
they
were
fond
and
he
gave
the
councillors
a
sarcastic
look
the
magistrates
winced
they
became
every
moment
more
uncomfortable
they
had
only
inflamed
the
popular
feeling
by
sending
for
the
prince
who
they
now
perceived
was
too
wise
to
commit
himself
by
any
illegal
act
nor
were
they
at
all
reassured
by
the
shouts
and
tumults
without
and
the
excited
faces
at
door
and
window
in
truth
the
landlord
had
had
orders
to
lay
the
repast
at
the
back
but
that
personage
could
not
bear
to
serve
his
highness
in
the
worst
parlour
which
was
not
he
declared
large
enough
nor
fine
enough
for
so
distinguished
a
company
in
defiance
of
his
orders
he
had
arranged
the
dinner
in
the
great
oak
chamber
with
its
shelves
of
brass
and
pottery
its
fine
pictures
its
handsome

delicacies
as

heron
jellied
venison
the
famous
sweet
cakes
from

thickened
with

and
a
variety
of
gorgeous
puddings
but
the
councillors
at
least
did
not
enjoy
it
even
the
splendid
wines
could
not
raise
their
spirits
the
prince
who
saw
fairly
clearly
the
end
of
the
comedy
and
could
not
but
enjoy
the
discomfiture
of
his
enemies
was
composed
and
gracious
he
commended
the
fare
and
praised
the
wealthy
appearance
of
the
prosperous
town
but
his
words
could
hardly
be
heard
for
the
clamour
in
the
streets
our
friends
without
make
converse
difficult
he
remarked
bentinck
laughed
the
prospect
of
the
present
triumph
had
driven
his
disappointment
at
the
prince
s
cold
dismissal
of
the
english
envoys
into
the
background
of
his
thoughts
he
was
young
enough
to
carry
himself
haughtily
and
kept
one
hand
on
his
and
another
on
his
yellow
moustaches
with
a
fine
martial
swagger
towards
the
end
of
the
repast
the
crowd
drove
back
the
burgher
captains
stationed
on
guard
at
the
door
van
beveren
could
contain
himself
no
longer
he
sprang
to
his
feet
for

your
highness
the
prince
glanced
at
him
sideways
what
is
the
matter
mynheer
the
burgomaster
rose

sir
he
cried
in
agitation
well
asked
william
calmly
setting
down
his
glittering
tankard

william
smiled
coldly
i

the
burgomaster
they
will
listen
to
no

but
you
your
not
even
to
their

magistrates
mynheer
inquired
william
maliciously
meanwhile
the
people
were
pressing
into
the
hall
of
the
inn
uttering
shouts
and
threats
you
do
not
seem
very
popular
said
the
prince
dryly
surveying
the
unhappy
councillors

to
the
friends
of

down
with

down
with
the
ruard
of

the
magistrates
all
rose
to
their
feet
do
not
spoil
your
dinners
mynheeren
said
william
your
highness
for
heaven
s
sake
the
crowd
broke
into
the
room
they
were
armed
with
muskets
swords
pistols
and
hatchets
and
headed
by
the
resolute
henry
dibbets
william
pushed
back
his
chair
and
looked
at
them
steadily
under
the
brim
of
his
beaver
what
do
you
want
my
friends
he
asked
calmly
tell
them
to
disperse
your
highness
urged
the
burgomaster
a
mass
of
people
blocked
the
entrance
into
the
room
they
turned
threateningly
to
the
councillors
we
are
here
to
see
justice
done
to
his
highness
they
declared
fiercely
you
seem
very
well
disposed
to
my
house
said
the
prince
laying
down
his
napkin
the
pastor
pushed
forward
flushed
and
triumphant
if
there
is
anything
his
highness
wants
he
cried
addressing
the
prince
let
him
ask
for
it
and
we
will
see
that
he
gets
william
s
eyes
flashed
under
his
lowered
lids
the
bearing
of
the
crowd
confirmed
the
pastor
s
promise
proved
that
they
were
not
mere
words
tell
them
to
go
home
your
highness
pleaded
the
burgomaster
this
is
against
the
laws
this
may
alter
the
laws
mynheer
answered
the
prince
proudly
your
highness
sides
with
this
revolt
cried
van
beveren
william
turned
his
powerful
glance
on
the
of
de
witt
i
do
nothing
mynheer
he
answered
coldly
i
wait
for
you
who
sent
for
me
you
who
have
the
authority
to
act
henry
dibbets
broke
in
if
they
are
at
a
loss
your
highness
we
will
soon
teach
them
what
to
the
magistrates
stood
nonplussed
overwhelmed
for
the
people
were
plainly
in
earnest
plainly
dangerous
the
town
secretary
orent
muys
whispered
to
the
burgomaster
that
they
had
best
yield
the
crowd
by
now
filling
the
room
caught
up
the
words
with
much
violence
they
swore
to
massacre
the
councillors
did
they
not
at
once
proclaim
the
prince
as
stadtholder
william
sat
immovable
it
was
obvious
that
he
would
neither
pacify
the
crowd
if
indeed
he
could
nor
so
declare
himself
or
his
wishes
as
to
shift
the
responsibility
to
his
from
the
shoulders
of
the
magistrates
they
seeing
that
they
could
never
leave
the
inn
alive
without
submitting
to
the
outcry
of
the
people
and
indeed
in
their
hearts
yielding
to
the
general
enthusiasm
consulted
how
should
they
combine
dignity
with
concession
the
prince
without
any
attempt
to
influence
them
remained
silent
at
the
head
of
the
table
the
people
did
not
give
them
long
urged
forward
by
the
pastor
two
of
them
seized
the
burgomaster
and
presented
a
pistol
to
his
forehead
you
have
played
the
fool
long
enough
they
declared
angrily
it
is
time
to
come
to
a
finding
himself
in
this
pass
van
hallingh
called
out
lustily
to
orent
muys
let
him
draw
up
a
paper
declaring
the
prince
elected
as
what
of
the
perpetual
edict
asked
william
you
have
i
think
sworn
to
we
will
absolve
them
of
that
oath
shouted
the
citizens
they
commanded
the
landlord
to
bring
pens
paper
and
a
standish
which
he
hastened
to
set
down
on
the
table
among
the
plates
and
tankards
with
fingers
a
little
trembling
orent
muys
wrote
out
an
article
by
which
the
council
of
dordt
elected
his
highness
as
stadtholder
and
commander
of
the
land
and
sea
forces
for
life
he
was
continually
urged
on
by
the
crowd
who
considered
that
he
dallied
in
his
task
it
was
finished
at
last
amid
yells
of
joy
and
one
after
another
the
magistrates
hastened
to
sign
no
one
dared
hesitate
with
a
loaded
blunderbuss
at
his
head
the
only
protest
came
from
the
prince
himself
he
rose
the
crowd
instantly
hushed
he
addressed
equally
the
burgomaster
the
councillors
and
the
citizens
pressing
round
the
table
mynheeren
he
said
i
am
very
sensible
of
the
honour
that
you
do
me
but
i
have
taken
an
oath
as
captain
general
never
to
attempt
the
the
magistrates
paused
astonished
but
the
people
were
not
in
the
least
confounded
your
highness
took
no
oath
to
refuse
the
office
if
offered
to
you
i
took
an
oath
replied
william
nor
can
i
lightly
break
he
spoke
with
no
emotion
with
the
cold
precision
of
a
statesman
a
manner
that
sat
curiously
on
his
youthful
appearance
it
did
not
chill
his
supporters
the
magistrates
themselves
were
driven
to
plead
with
him
for
the
good
of
the
state
we
must
ask
your
highness
to
ah
said
the
prince
urge
me
in
the
name
of
the
people
whose
will
is
above
the
law
added
henry
dibbets
i
swore
before
god
replied
william
then
god
shall
absolve
your
highness
returned
the
pastor
the
usurper
forced
you
to
take
an
oath
against
justice
and
i
solemnly
absolve
your
highness
from
with
one
accord
councillors
pastors
and
citizens
set
william
free
of
his
vow
to
the
republic
he
yielded
coldly
and
the
first
act
of
the
revolution
was
complete
there
is
an
emotion
that
bears
the
name
of
no
one
feeling
because
it
is
composed
of
all
it
is
the
passion
that
shakes
a
crowd
when
it
is
witness
of
any
great
event
this
seized
the
people
of
dordt
they
shouted
laughed
wrung
each
other
s
hands
rushed
in
a
mass
to
float
the
orange
flag
from
the
belfry
of
their
great
church
drank
the
prince
s
health
and
confusion
to
the
french
and
swarmed
and
pushed
round
the
door
of
the
peacock
inn
where
the
councillors
were
still
imprisoned
the
resolution
signed
by
the
seventeen
councillors
present
the
seals
of
the
town
affixed
was
snatched
up
by
the
pastor
dibbets
and
displayed
to
the
townsmen
loud
cries
rang
out
long
live
the
stadtholder
long
live
his
highness
william
looked
at
the
magistrates
so
they
had
been
forced
to
return
him
the
power
they
had
taken
from
his
father
william
ii
many
of
them
indeed
were
one
and
the
same
with
the
men
who
had
defied
him
dordt
is
fortunate
for
calvinists
mynheeren
he
said
smiling
they
were
successful
in
they
win
a
victory
in
it
was
his
sole
revenge
on
them
for
twenty
years
lost
from
his
birthright
they
received
it
in
silence
if
it
be
possible
he
added
i
should
prefer
now
to
return
to
newerbrugge
for
he
hated
all
display
and
commotion
and
though
this
was
a
proud
moment
for
him
he
sighed
for
the
quiet
of
the
camp
but
it
was
not
permitted
he
must
hold
a
reception
in
the
inn
and
receive
the
homage
of
the
whole
town
of
dordt
every
one
wanted
to
kiss
his
hand
to
swear
loyalty
to
see
the
popular
hero
for
himself
at
a
moment
when
the
unbridled
enthusiasm
was
at
its
height
a
burgher
captain
chanced
to
notice
that
one
name
was
missing
seventeen
councillors
had
signed
for
william
there
should
have
been
one
more
one
man
in
the
whole
of
dordt
had
not
subscribed
to
the
will
of
the
people
cornelius
de
in
a
moment
the
crowd
was
on
fire
with
this
new
idea
the
eighteenth
councillor
must
also
sign
here
was
a
splendid
opportunity
for
humiliating
one
of
the
hated
family
of
the
grand
pensionary
beveren
ventured
to
protest
the
ruard
is
ill
unable
to
leave
his
he
was
answered
with
derision
not
too
ill
to
hold
a
pen
shall
the
worst
traitor
escape
beveren
appealed
to
the
prince
highness
these
men
are
miscalling
de
but
william
answered
coldly
mynheer
the
faction
of
de
witt
have
miscalled
me
for
a
good
many
but
they
will
murder
the
let
him
sign
said
william
the
crowd
took
up
the
cry
let
him
sign
they
yelled
the
councillors
hesitated
the
ruard
would
not
subscribe
to
force
him
to
refuse
would
be
to
deliver
him
over
to
the
fury
of
the
mob
but
william
decided
for
them
i
think
i
have
some
weight
in
this
town
now
he
said
with
his
immovable
air
of
authority
he
took
the
paper
from
the
hand
of
the
pastor
and
gave
it
to
the
town
secretary
take
this
to
de
witt
his
signature
is
you
also
he
pointed
his
cane
at
the
captain
of
the
burghers
accompany
him
with
some
of
your
men
i
am
sorry
de
witt
is
too
sick
to
be
present
i
shall
be
pleased
to
see
his
name
to
this
chapter
v
cornelius
de
witt
the
agitated
secretary
the
triumphant
captain
and
a
vast
crowd
of
excited
citizens
whom
the
civic
guard
could
scarce
restrain
proceeded
to
the
house
of
cornelius
de
witt
all
day
the
ruard
s
family
had
been
in
a
state
of
acute
alarm
the
late
attack
on
the
pensionary
the
popular
feeling
in
dordt
the
burning
of
the
pictures
in
the
stadhuis
the
menacing
aspect
of
the
streets
all
combined
to
render
them
grievously
uneasy
only
a
few
days
previously
three
strangers
had
demanded
to
see
the
ruard
and
on
being
refused
on
account
of
the
lateness
of
the
hour
had
attempted
to
force
a
way
in
and
had
only
been
repulsed
by
the
promptitude
of
the
servant
in
calling
help
madam
de
witt
firmly
believed
that
this
was
a
murderous
plot
a
counterpart
to
that
to
which
her
had
fallen
a
victim
and
her
fine
courage
could
not
subdue
the
terror
inspired
by
the
surroundings
of
hate
malice
and
fury
against
which
her
helpless
husband
had
no
weapon
she
had
listened
to
the
shouts
that
proclaimed
a
restoration
and
showed
that
the
magistrates
their
sole
protection
had
been
overawed
by
the
people
and
that
no
one
in
dordt
had
dared
to
stand
firm
to
the
government
of
john
de
witt
she
could
only
hope
that
her
husband
might
be
forgotten
in
the
general
excitement
and
with
this
quieted
her
cruel
anxiety
but
when
the
servant
came
to
tell
her
that
a
vast
armed
crowd
was
advancing
down
the
street
she
knew
her
hopes
had
been
illusions
her
proud
spirit
that
had
always
supported
her
husband
s
dangers
with
high
courage
sank
before
what
she
was
called
upon
to
face
with
yells
cries
and
shouts
for
the
new
stadtholder
on
came
the
crowd
and
surged
about
the
door
of
the
house
let
the
town
secretary
get
the
signature
of
de
witt
or
they
would
enter
and
try
for
themselves
leaving
some
of
the
civic
guard
at
the
door
as
a
concession
to
law
and
order
orent
muys
the
secretary
the
captain
and
three
of
his
soldiers
entered
the
house
maria
de
witt
pale
and
cold
outwardly
calm
received
them
in
the
her
black
eyes
were
full
of
tears
but
she
kept
them
fixed
resolutely
on
the
secretary
the
two
men
uncovered
and
bowed
what
do
you
want
she
demanded
gripping
the
back
of
a
chair
your
husband
madam
answered
muys

can
not
see

hoogewerf
interposed

stadtholder
of
my
husband

think
so
madam
i
do
this
with
instinctive
pride
the
captain
pointed
with
his
gloved
hand
to
the
window
i
should
not
care
to
answer
for
what
that
crowd
may
do
if
disappointed
my
husband
answered
madam
de
witt
with
a
look
of
agony
has
sworn
to
the
perpetual
so
had
the
other

they
signed
the
signature
of
de
witt

the
one
lacking
she
tried
to
rally
herself
this
is
a
revolution
he
corrected
a
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
my
husband
he
is
a
councillor
of
mynheer
she
appealed
to
the
secretary
in
great
agitation
i
swear
to
you
de
witt
is
ill
we
only
want
his
signature
he
can
not
hold
a
pen

replied
the
captain
she
drew
herself
up
i
will
not
admit
you
to
his
chamber
he
is
too
she
was
desperate
to
forestall
her
husband
s
inevitable
refusal
to
sign
but
captain
hoogewerf
was
not
to
be
moved
from
his
purpose
madam
he
asked
are
not
your
children
in
the
house
she
shrank
what
of
it
for
their
sakes
advise
your
husband
to
what
do
you
mean
madam
the
people
she
interrupted
is
the
town
delivered
over
to
the
mob
it
is
in
the
hands
of
the
friends
of
his
i
think
that
means
the
same
thing
she
flashed
the
captain
became
impatient
the
paper
madam
we
must
see
de
what
if
he
refuse
she
asked
in
a
desperate
voice
he
will
not
before
god
he
will
she
cried
knowing
him
you
must
persuade
him
to
his
own
dishonour
for
his
own
i
can
not
think
of
your
children
she
was
silent
madam
urged
the
secretary
i
entreat
you
do
not
make
delays
that
must
further
inflame
the
madam
de
witt
dared
resist
no
longer
she
heard
the
furious
din
without
she
saw
the
immovable
face
of
captain
hoogewerf
and
through
her
open
door
the
scarlet
coats
of
the
soldiers
in
the
corridor
she
did
not
think
her
husband
would
sign
she
made
the
anguished
resolve
that
she
must
persuade
him
to
it
even
against
her
conscience
i
will
take
the
paper
to
him
she
said
with
the
instinct
to
soften
the
humiliation
of
her
husband
s
consent
but
captain
hoogewerf
saw
her
motive
no
madam
it
must
be
in
our
she
passed
in
silence
to
the
door
the
sunlight
on
her
dark
velvet
gown
the
deep
lace
collar
on
her
shoulders
not
more
white
than
her
face
the
secretary
followed
her
reluctantly
he
hated
his
task
he
had
been
overawed
hoogewerf
however
an
ardent
orangist
had
no
compunction
he
bade
his
soldiers
follow
him
is
this
necessary
asked
maria
de
witt
proudly
such
are
my
orders
my
husband
is
no
criminal
mynheer
that
soldiers
should
enter
his
you
lose
time
you
will
regret

he
answered
a
delicate
colour
rose
into
her
beautiful
still
face
this
tone
is
new
among
us
she
said
we
who
have
always
boasted
of
our
liberty
take
care
what
you
say
madam
captain
hoogewerf
warned
her
the
prince
of
orange
is
master
the
republican
lady
paused
her
fingers
on
the
handle
of
her
husband
s
chamber
door
one
may
know
it
she
replied
coldly
by
your
change
of
front
mynheer
even
yesterday
would
not
have
dared
to
insult
a
de
madam
pleaded
the
terrified
secretary
she
opened
the
door
and
passed
before
them
into
the
darkened
and
lofty
bedchamber
the
valet
had
been
before
them
and
had
warned
his
master
of
what
was
happening
they
found
him
standing
by
the
great
bed
with
its
gold
and
crimson
hangings
supporting
the
ruard
who
weak
and
faint
with
suffering
was
endeavouring
to
sit
up
against
the
pillows
at
the
first
glance
round
his
simple
privacy
the
instant
impression
of
a
sick
and
helpless
man
the
secretary
fell
back
but
captain
hoogewerf
strode
forward
the
eyes
of
cornelius
de
witt
shone
in
his
worn
face
with
as
proud
a
light
as
they
had
shown
when
he
kept
his
place
on
the
deck
of
seven
amid
the
hurry
of
battle
captain
hoogewerf
he
said
in
a
feeble
but
resolute
voice
what
means
this
unruly
entrance
it
means
he
was
answered
that
this
town
is
now
under
the
government
of
his
highness
the
cornelius
de
witt
frowned
haughtily
his
wife
stepped
to
his
bedside
and
stood
with
her
hand
on
the
curtain
looking
from
him
to
the
captain
from
him
to
the
secretary
just
inside
the
door
the
three
soldiers
waited
orent
muys
speaking
with
more
consideration
informed
the
ruard
of
the
revolution
in
dordt
and
produced
his
paper
with
the
hanging
seals
this
is
against
the
law
said
de
witt
mynheer
it
the
law
all
the
magistrates
have
the
secretary
held
out
the
document
as
he
spoke
then
they
are
perjured
replied
the
ruard
proudly
do
you
use
that
word
of
his
highness
friends
demanded
captain
hoogewerf
in
a
loud
voice
cornelius
de
witt
drew
himself
up
higher
in
his
bed
i
use
that
word
of
any
one
who
has
sworn
to
the
perpetual
edict
and
then
declares
his
highness
his
wife
turned
to
him
quickly
cornelius
his
highness
is
master
in
dordt
muys
hath
come
to
read
you
the
act
so
proclaiming
he
glanced
at
her
rather
curiously
and
she
reading
some
reproach
in
his
eyes
sank
down
on
the
chair
at
his
bedside
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hand
de
witt
pushed
back
the
long
dark
hair
from
his
ravaged
face
and
fixed
the
secretary
with
a
cold
and
undaunted
look
why
are
you
come
here
to
read
me
that
he
demanded
the
soldier
replied
we
desire
your
i
think
said
the
ruard
scornfully
ye
do
not
find
it
as
collector
of
taxes
superintendent
of
the
dykes
magistrate
of
dordt
and
ruard
of
putten
your
signature
is
indeed
maria
de
witt
raised
her
face
do
you
not
hear
them
in
the
street
she
whispered
her
husband
neither
answered
her
nor
looked
in
her
direction
read
this
document
he
ordered
curtly
the
secretary
obeyed
when
he
had
finished
the
ruard
stole
a
glance
at
his
wife
who
sat
with
averted
face
he
seemed
to
be
listening
to
the
impatient
and
angry
cries
without
that
mingled
with
snatches
of
aldegonde
s
hymn
and
curses
on
the
grand
pensionary
s
name
came
clearly
through
the
curtained
window
can
not
that
be
worded
less
positively
he
asked
slowly
mynheer
it
is
impossible
answered
the
secretary
we
came
for
your
signature
not
for
your
amendments
remarked
the
soldier
i
would
rather
be
killed
in
my
bed
than
sign
answered
the
ruard
with
a
flush
of
colour
into
his
face
hoogewerf
stepped
forward
threateningly
i
have
sworn
an
oath
to
the
perpetual
edict
said
de
witt
and
i
will
keep
it
even
if
you
strike
off
my
head
with
the
sword
you
have
there
at
your
i
have
not
come
as
an
assassin
replied
the
captain
well
answered
the
ruard
there
are
plenty
of
vagabonds
and
ruffians
below
who
would
not
hesitate
call
up
some
of
oh
mynheer
cried
the
distressed
secretary
those
you
hear
are
friends
of
his
highness
respectable
people
they
only
clamour
for
your
de
witt
turned
away
his
head
as
if
in
weariness
whatever
happens
he
said
shortly
i
can
not
his
wife
put
out
her
hand
and
clasped
his
that
lay
on
the
coverlet
cornelius
she
urged
in
an
unsteady
voice
it
is
not
safe
to
as
a
citizen
of
dordt
i
can
not
do
otherwise
he
answered
briefly
there
are
the
children
said
maria
de
witt
the
ruard
flashed
a
stern
look
at
the
secretary
are
you
incapable
of
protecting
my
house
and
family
he
demanded
orent
muys
answered
in
great
agitation
mynheer
his
highness
has
been
proclaimed
stadtholder
he
is
now
at
the
peacock
inn
receiving
the
homage
of
the
crowd
and
i
have
to
take
your
signature
back
to
him
otherwise
really
mynheer
i
could
not
answer
for
it
they
are
all
worthy
people
such
as
your
own
baker
or
butcher
might
be
but
they
are
excited
he
paused
as
the
fierce
sounds
of
a
tussle
between
the
mob
and
the
burgher
guards
rose
from
the
street
maria
de
witt
sprang
up
and
went
to
the
window
she
was
seen
from
below
and
greeted
with
a
yell
of
fury
and
a
shower
of
pebbles
cornelius
she
came
back
breathlessly
they
will
break
in
and
if
they
do
the
ruard
questioned
captain
hoogewerf
then
i
think
was
the
answer
that
they
will
serve
you
as
they
served
your
portrait
in
the
madam
de
witt
gave
a
little
cry
and
her
husband
s
eyes
flashed
then
make
an
end
now
he
exclaimed
passionately
i
would
rather
be
stabbed
in
my
bed
than
be
torn
to
pieces
by
the
oh
my
dear
mynheer
if
you
would
only
sign
cried
the
secretary
i
can
not
maria
de
witt
went
on
her
knees
clasping
her
hands
against
the
coverlet
oh
cornelius
i
must
he
turned
his
sad
brown
eyes
on
her
with
an
expression
of
gentle
reproach
ah
he
said
you
have
always
been
so
brave
so
careful
of
my
i
can
not
face
this
she
answered
desperately
i
can
not
they
will
murder
you
and
the
children
are
in
the
you
must
send
them
it
is
impossible
there
is
a
crowd
back
and
maria
he
said
in
an
anguished
tone
i
can
not
he
turned
his
face
from
her
and
she
sprang
to
her
feet
with
her
hand
to
her
brow
the
lace
on
her
bosom
rose
painfully
with
her
agitated
breathing
the
pearls
pressed
tight
round
her
swelling
throat
her
countenance
framed
in
the
long
black
ringlets
was
suffused
and
trembling
have
you
no
regard
for
your
wife
asked
captain
hoogewerf
i
have
some
regard
for
my
honour
replied
the
ruard
wiping
his
forehead
damp
with
anguish
of
mind
and
body
the
sound
of
blows
and
splintering
wood
told
that
the
door
was
being
forced
bloodthirsty
cries
of
rage
and
triumph
pierced
the
din
of
the
attack

with
the
friends

the

down
with
the
enemies
of

cornelius

grimly

mynheer
begged
the
secretary
or
we
shall
all
be
murdered
a
stone
hurtled
through
the
window
and
struck
one
of
the
posts
of
the
bed
oh
god
help
us
exclaimed
maria
de
witt
she
flung
herself
on
her
knees
again
my
lord
for
the
sake
of
the
children
a
musket
was
fired
below
and
one
of
the
servants
shrieked
well
mynheer
asked
captain
hoogewerf
how
much
longer
are
we
to
wait
put
your
pistol
through
my
head
answered
the
ruard
hoarsely
for
i
will
not

torn
to

by
the
he
repeated
that
is
a
horrible
death
to
be
torn
in

by

was
bitterly
weeping
if
you
will

said
in
despair
then
i
must
leave

help
me
i
must
see
to
some
means
of
safety
for

the
secretary
had
snatched
up
a
pen
and
now
came
to
the
bedside
and
forced
it
into
the
ruard
s
fingers
oh
you
are
a
father
before
you
are
a
citizen
exclaimed
maria
de
witt
this
is
not
perjury
you
are
absolved
by
the
actions
of
the
slowly
cornelius
de
witt
took
up
the
quill
in
his
feeble
fingers
he
bit
his
full
and
his
eyes
narrowed
what
will
be
said
of
a
man
who
was
vanquished
by
his
wife
s
tears
he
muttered
he
could
scarcely
hold
the
pen
he
looked
at
his
wife
maria
maria
dost
thou
think
this
compliance
can
save
me
from
the
inevitable
there
was
a
silence
as
he
dipped
his
quill
in
the
ink
and
reluctantly
traced
his
name
the
last
on
the
list
then
as
the
secretary
took
the
paper
madam
de
witt
rose
with
a
breath
of
agonised
relief
but
orent
muys
looking
at
the
writing
cried
out
what
is
this
mynheer
what
have
you
put
after
your
name
two
letters
that
means
replied
the
ruard
shortly
if
you
have
forgot
your
latin
the
translation
runs
constrained
by
this
is
but
playing
with
us
exclaimed
captain
hoogewerf
i
implore
you
mynheer
urged
the
secretary
you
will
only
rouse
the
fury
of
the
people
scratch
out
those
i
shall
not
retract
them
he
answered
constrained
by
force
otherwise
i
should
not
have
the
secretary
looked
at
the
captain
and
the
captain
at
the
soldiers
orent
muys
tried
persuasions
and
hoogewerf
threats
but
cornelius
de
witt
was
immovable
he
turned
away
his
face
on
the
pillow
and
was
silent
maria
de
witt
dropped
the
red
curtain
of
the
bed
and
unseen
by
her
husband
drew
the
paper
from
the
secretary
s
hand
with
her
finger
on
her
lips
she
silenced
them
and
withdrawing
to
the
back
of
the
chamber
hastily
effaced
the
two
letters
you
are
very
scrupulous
mynheer
said
captain
hoogewerf
it
seems
i
am
the
only
one
in
dordt
returned
the
ruard
who
remembers
his
captain
hoogewerf
clapped
on
his
hat
you
will
be
sorry
some
day
that
you
spoke
so
recklessly
he
said
and
strode
out
of
the
room
followed
by
the
soldiers
and
the
secretary
maria
de
witt
leant
heavily
against
the
pressing
her
handkerchief
to
her
reddened
eyes
a
loud
triumphant
and
insulting
shout
told
the
joy
of
the
crowd
when
they
heard
that
the
ruard
had
submitted
and
with
a
mighty
turmoil
and
sound
of
singing
and
cheering
they
swept
away
up
the
street
to
the
peacock
inn
cornelius
de
witt
clenched
his
hand
on
the
coverlet
i
had
better
have
died
he
murmured
his
wife
came
and
bent
over
his
pillow
do
you
blame
me
she
asked
shuddering
ah
you
think
that
i
have
been
no
he
answered
there
were
the
children
but
nothing
can
save
us
they
have
gone
she
breathed
yes
now
he
answered
mournfully
but
what
can
protect
us
john
and
me
against
the
whole
country
s
hate
she
cried
out
passionately
they
can
not
hate
you
it
is
impossible
he
leant
back
exhausted
you
have
heard
dearest
how
they
hate
me
the
prince
is
master
the
prince
she
said
in
terror
he
would
not
allow
any
harm
to
come
to
i
should
not
ask
for
his
protection
he
is
not
master
nor
shall
she
went
on
her
knees
beside
the
bed
and
laid
her
lips
to
his
hand
god
almighty
guard
us
she
whispered
he
who
is
greater
than
princes
has
us
in
his
charge
amen
amen
cried
the
ruard
and
may
he
give
me
courage
to
meet
the
exceeding
bitterness
of
my
inevitable
end
he
laid
his
free
hand
on
her
bowed
black
head
and
the
tears
welled
up
into
his
eyes
for
the
ruin
of
the
ideals
to
which
he
had
given
his
life

in

found

seated
languidly
at
the
open
window
of
his
library
wearing
a
loose
japanese
robe
and
gazing
out
at
the
sunny
garden
and
the
doves
in
the
trees
on
the
chair
beside
him
lay
an
open
portfolio
of
sketches

asked
fagel
with
some
embarrassment
the
grand
pensionary
smiled
sadly
i
hope
to
be
able
to
resume
my
duties

he
roused
himself
and
sat
up

said

of
bitterness

said
to
tell
you
of
a
i
knew
answered
john
de
witt
that
it
must
be
gaspard
fagel
drew
himself
up
with
some
importance
the
deputies
of
holland
have
proclaimed
his
highness
stadtholder
and
captain
general
of
the
republic
for
life
with
all
the
dignities
formerly
belonging
to
his
in
these
pompous
words
sounded
the
of
the
lifelong
labour
hopes
policy
and
ideals
of
john
de
witt
he
looked
out
again
upon
the
doves
in
the
trembling
elm
boughs
they
have
kept
me
short
of
news
for
i
have
been
very
ill
he
answered
quietly
but
i
have
known
how
it
must
gaspard
fagel
was
full
of
his
subject
the
deputies
left
two
days
ago
for
bodegraven
that
they
may
acquaint
his
highness
and
bring
him
to
the
hague
to
take
the
something
i
heard
of
fagel
was
exultant
it
is
not
a
fortnight
since
dordt
gave
the
signal
rotterdam
was
the
next
we
had
the
whole
country
in
a
flame
the
peasants
took
possession
of
delft
it
was
irresistible
irresistible
the
states
were
swept
off
their
feet
the
inexorable
conditions
imposed
by
france
helped
the
perpetual
edict
was
repealed
even
amsterdam
clamoured
for
the
prince
i
tell
you
mynheer
he
is
king
though
without
the
the
people
have
overawed
the
magistrates
remarked
de
witt
what
need
for
the
details
the
prince
is
he
was
still
looking
out
of
the
window
and
the
reflection
of
the
green
trees
gave
a
ghastly
hue
to
his
worn
colourless
face
what
of
the
war
he
asked
gaspard
fagel
lifted
his
shoulders
the
bishop
of
munster
overruns
groningen
but
the
elector
and
the
spanish
troops
are
expected
soon
the
people
are
wonderfully
heartened
they
can
think
of
nothing
but
the
how
did
he
take
this
change
of
fortune
asked
the
grand
pensionary
he
met
the
deputies
of
rotterdam
with
cold
reserve
and
said
he
would
not
have
the
people
force
the
magistrates
he
would
have
his
rights
by
law
not
violence
he
met
the
states
at
bodegraven
in
his
carriage
and
asked
them
first
if
he
was
relieved
of
his
oath
they
said
yes
and
then
he
merely
told
them
he
took
the
office
for
the
good
of
the
country
beuningen
was
there
all
the
john
de
witt
answered
quietly
the
prince
never
lacked
for
prudence
he
will
not
perish
by
his
father
s
he
is
the
idol
of
the
people
beuningen
says
the
soldiers
worship
he
has
great
qualities
said
de
witt
and
i
have
educated
him
to
be
a
patriot
i
hope
he
may
fulfil
the
expectancy
of
the
fagel
looked
uneasy
well
he
said
i
do
not
know
why
i
talk
of
this
so
much
i
came
about
your
business
the
grand
pensionary
flushed
my
memorial
to
their
high
mightinesses
he
asked
even
that
the
grand
pensionary
roused
himself
i
trust
he
said
proudly
they
have
been
pleased
to
consider
how
very
bitter
it
was
to
me
to
have
to
stoop
to
justify
myself
against
the
attacks
of
a
gaspard
fagel
answered
hastily
it
was
of
course
malicious
there
were
many
who
believed
in
it
therefore
i
was
forced
to
their
noble
mightinesses
declare
there
is
no
truth
in
the
i
am
glad
they
do
me
that
justice
said
john
de
witt
simply
gaspard
fagel
frowned
but
i
am
obliged
to
add
mynheer
that
what
their
noble
mightinesses
say
carries
no
weight
now
whatever
and
i
fear
these
charges
against
you
are
as
eagerly
believed
as
they
must
be
refuted
replied
the
grand
pensionary
with
energy
i
will
not
have
these
hideous
stains
upon
my
fagel
shook
his
head
there
is
only
one
man
whose
voice
can
be
heard
now
the
prince
yes
his
highness
the
then
declared
john
de
witt
proudly
and
calmly
i
will
write
to
him
he
will
have
the
nobility
to
see
justice
done
he
knows
that
i
have
not
taken
the
secret
service
money
or
he
made
an
impatient
gesture
i
can
not
repeat
them
but
the
prince
knows
what
manner
of
man
i
the
people
will
listen
to
him
but
to
none
other
what
he
says
i
think
they
will
john
de
witt
gave
a
little
sigh
the
secretary
of
the
states
was
slightly
uncomfortable
in
his
presence
disconcerted
before
his
utter
serenity
gaspard
fagel
had
an
uneasy
feeling
that
de
witt
s
was
the
calm
of
a
man
he
sat
looking
at
the
minister
whom
he
had
followed
envied
rivalled
and
now
supplanted
and
his
triumph
was
by
no
means
unalloyed
the
grand
pensionary
turned
his
full
brown
eyes
on
him
what
will
the
prince
do
with
his
power
one
can
not
tell
frankly
he
makes
no
confidant
of
me
or
any
it
is
thought
he
will
break
off
the
negotiations
with
king
louis
he
still
hopes
to
detach
the
yet
could
not
come
to
terms
with
them
at
newerbrugge
it
is
not
known
what
passed
there
beuningen
thinks
they
made
him
secret
offers
and
that
he
refused
them
at
least
he
is
hot
against
de
groot
some
say
he
will
be
arrested
on
the
ground
of
having
exceeded
his
commission
de
montbas
action
has
not
helped
his
what
hath
de
montbas
done
demanded
john
de
witt
joined
the
french
returned
gaspard
fagel
laconically
m
de
montbas
has
deserted
to
the
french
exclaimed
john
de
witt
he
was
you
know
a
prisoner
arrested
for
gross
failure
in
duty
and
when
he
saw
the
prince
was
resolved
on
his
life
he
became
desperate
and
contriving
to
escape
fled
to
the
enemy
king
louis
will
forgive
him
doubtless
for
the
information
he
is
able
to
supply
the
grand
pensionary
was
silent
you
must
see
added
fagel
that
this
does
not
improve
your
credit
with
the
john
de
witt
raised
his
tired
eyes
i
do
not
know
mynheer
he
said
quietly
why
you
have
come
to
tell
me
all
gaspard
fagel
rose
restlessly
on
a
table
near
by
was
a
white
china
pot
full
of
tulips
he
stopped
beside
this
and
stared
into
the
cups
where
the
dusty
black
pistils
showed
i
should
advise
you
to
leave
the
hague
he
said
i
can
not
leave
my
post
answered
the
grand
pensionary
your
illness
is
a
fair
john
de
witt
shook
his
head
the
country
still
needs
me
he
said
in
a
few
days
i
hope
to
be
again
in
the
gaspard
fagel
pulled
at
the
tulip
petals
i
am
your
friend
he
declared
the
grand
pensionary
gave
him
a
quiet
look
yes
your
friend
fagel
repeated
defiantly
do
not
think
because
i
follow
the
prince
that
i
am
no
friend
to
you
i
have
much
very
much
to
be
grateful
to
you
for
i
he
hesitated
a
second
i
should
like
to
do
you
a
service
by
now
john
de
witt
had
turned
his
eyes
from
him
to
the
pattern
of
blue
sky
to
be
seen
through
the
intertwisting
leaves
and
branches
of
the
elms
and
limes
gaspard
fagel
stuck
his
fingers
into
his
sash
in
this
state
we
are
in
he
said
we
can
not
afford
internal
the
phrase
sounded
trite
to
de
witt
he
raised
his
long
hand
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
and
let
it
fall
again
i
am
ambitious
continued
fagel
to
be
a
mediator
well
between
you
and
his
the
grand
pensionary
answered
without
turning
his
head
in
what
manner
fagel
was
rather
at
a
loss
to
express
himself
his
highness
is
stadtholder
he
remarked
nevertheless
i
am
still
grand
pensionary
the
office
remains
yes
replied
fagel
but
it
must
be
filled
by
a
man
who
will
work
with
his
john
de
witt
showed
some
signs
of
agitation
m
fagel
he
said
sitting
erect
if
you
are
here
to
suggest
that
i
work
under
his
highness
the
mere
secretary
of
his
ambition
the
servant
of
his
designs
i
beg
you
say
no
this
is
not
it
is
very
john
de
witt
s
voice
was
stern
for
twenty
years
i
have
stood
at
the
helm
of
this
republic
i
have
guided
her
through
storms
and
perils
through
god
s
help
i
have
always
maintained
her
dignity
and
prosperity
an
uncorrupt
free
republic
was
my
ideal
well
i
served
it
i
have
fallen
i
have
failed
i
have
been
repaid
with
hate
where
i
worked
for
love
but
i
will
never
be
the
tool
of
the
prince
who
has
destroyed
my
work
nor
help
the
people
set
a
yoke
again
upon
their
mynheer
you
talk
rashly
we
are
as
free
as
ever
we
john
de
witt
s
eyes
flashed
you
deceive
yourself
you
have
put
at
the
head
of
the
state
a
young
man
with
a
temper
as
imperious
as
any
of
his
house
a
stewart
for
pride
a
nassau
for
firmness
were
we
free
in
the
days
of
prince
maurice
we
shall
not
be
free
under
this
youth
for
twenty
years
we
have
tasted
real
liberty
and
now
he
will
make
us
gaspard
fagel
replied
vehemently
indeed
you
wrong
his
highness
he
is
the
sole
hope
of
the
i
believe
that
he
will
save
others
could
have
saved
you
had
you
permitted
if
he
be
a
patriot
he
is
not
the
only
one
in
the
united
this
attitude
is
dangerous
said
gaspard
fagel
john
de
witt
looked
at
him
with
an
air
almost
of
pity
do
you
think
that
i
will
alter
the
whole
aim
of
my
life
to
buy
a
little
favour
now
do
you
imagine
that
i
will
trim
my
course
to
please
this
youth
who
was
my
pupil
and
now
is
your
i
do
not
admit
it
nor
ever
will
there
is
no
master
in
this
fagel
answered
with
some
impatience
so
you
are
not
tractable
you
will
not
work
under
the
prince
i
will
work
with
him
when
i
agree
with
very
well
you
can
not
expect
mynheer
to
find
the
stadtholder
i
expect
said
john
de
witt
proudly
to
find
him
this
attitude
of
yours
will
not
please
i
can
not
care
for
he
is
all
powerful
john
de
witt
interrupted
i
do
not
think
that
he
will
use
his
power
to
gratify
his
political
dislikes
he
knows
my
principles
he
knows
that
i
am
likely
to
abide
by
them
he
can
not
be
either
surprised
or
angered
that
he
does
not
see
me
swell
the
crowd
gathered
to
do
him
gaspard
fagel
frowned
that
is
your
decision
your
final
decision
john
de
witt
bent
his
head
then
he
added
keenly
did
the
prince
send
you
i
have
not
seen
him
since
the
opening
of
the
war
nor
has
he
mentioned
this
question
in
his
letters
but
beuningen
says
he
remarked
to
him
that
you
must
bend
or
john
de
witt
faintly
smiled
i
also
can
be
inflexible
he
said
i
can
serve
my
ideal
as
steadily
as
his
highness
serves
his
gaspard
fagel
seemed
troubled
if
you
continue
to
oppose
the
prince
he
said
bluntly
you
will
scarcely
be
safe
at
the
are
you
trying
to
frighten
me
i
am
warning
you
join
with
the
prince
or
resign
and
leave
the
the
grand
pensionary
replied
firmly
neither
one
nor
the
other
mynheer
i
will
not
forsake
the
policy
i
have
adhered
to
all
my
life
nor
will
i
leave
my
post
until
i
am
relieved
of
fagel
bit
his
forefinger
he
had
a
sincere
regard
for
de
witt
and
his
conscience
troubled
him
because
the
grand
pensionary
had
given
him
this
secretaryship
he
now
held
and
did
not
utter
a
word
of
reproach
it
is
like
a
great
storm
he
said
sweeping
everything
before
it
they
who
fling
themselves
down
may
escape
but
they
who
remain
erect
are
certainly
carried
away
and
john
de
witt
gazed
at
him
steadily
you
are
an
able
man
mynheer
fagel
i
think
you
will
be
of
great
service
to
the
prince
and
the
country
but
for
me
you
can
do
nothing
there
is
no
more
to
be
the
secretary
smoothed
the
bands
at
his
wrists
slightly
coloured
and
bit
his
lip
hesitating
he
glanced
sideways
at
the
grand
pensionary
once
or
twice
john
de
witt
had
turned
his
eyes
away
and
by
his
demeanour
seemed
not
to
know
there
was
another
with
him
in
the
room
at
last
gaspard
fagel
gathered
up
his
hat
and
cane
and
left
the
quiet
library
without
another
word
john
de
witt
kept
his
gaze
still
on
the
sky
the
leaves
and
the
chinks
of
it
seen
between
them
took
on
a
thousand
different
changing
shapes
gold
green
and
blue
the
sun
reached
the
glossy
box
hedges
in
tendrils
of
spangled
light
and
gilded
the
tulips
now
and
ragged
with
a
keen
yellow
the
grand
pensionary
s
vision
was
bounded
by
a
deep
red
beech
tree
through
whose
heavy
branches
the
sky
appeared
bright
and
pale
and
in
the
shadow
it
threw
two
doves
were
walking
on
the
smooth
sweep
of
close
grass
john
de
witt
felt
so
weary
that
there
was
a
pain
even
in
resting
a
disquietude
in
gazing
at
the
pictured
peace
of
the
garden
it
seemed
that
only
oblivion
could
give
ease
to
his
languid
body
and
aching
soul
in
a
breath
had
gone
the
labour
of
a
lifetime
he
had
worked
incredibly
with
sincerity
with
passion
with
unsparing
patience
and
energy
and
for
reward
he
was
thrust
aside
with
hatred
and
curses
for
the
sake
of
the
heir
of
the
old
house
from
whose
tyranny
he
had
saved
his
country
no
one
believed
in
him
no
one
trusted
in
his
honour
he
had
always
been
of
an
integrity
above
suspicion
but
it
did
not
save
him
from
being
accused
of
the
vilest
crimes
he
had
given
his
life
to
his
country
and
was
reproached
with
having
sold
her
to
her
enemies
he
had
always
lived
as
simply
as
an
ordinary
citizen
nevertheless
it
was
laid
to
his
charge
that
he
had
appropriated
large
sums
from
the
public
funds
calumny
was
triumphant
there
was
no
stain
she
did
not
try
to
cast
on
the
name
of
a
man
who
had
never
committed
a
single
unworthy
action
his
former
good
fame
availed
him
nothing
the
prosperity
of
the
country
under
his
rule
was
not
remembered
to
his
credit
now
malice
would
not
listen
to
reason
nor
justice
and
there
was
no
one
who
dared
speak
for
him
save
those
helpless
in
a
like
case
there
were
a
few
faithful
his
vivien
pensionary
of
dordt
peter
de
groot
colonel
bampfield
but
their
voices
could
not
be
heard
above
the
shrieks
of
the
factions
they
had
their
own
several
lives
and
honours
to
look
to
if
they
could
no
longer
support
him
he
could
no
longer
protect
them
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
bandage
round
his
right
arm
that
covered
a
still
aching
wound
the
little
senseless
chatter
of
the
birds
in
the
branches
the
faint
murmurs
of
the
wind
were
not
so
strong
as
a
tumult
of
imaginary
sounds
that
beat
loud
and
threatening
on
the
inner
senses
of
john
de
witt
the
cries
of
an
angry
crowd
the
beating
of
alarm
bells
the
hurrying
of
eager
feet
swelling
in
volume
coming
through
the
green
and
gold
and
blue
glimpsed
a
vision
of
these
people
furious
faces
threatening
gestures
brandished
weapons
dangerous
powerful
irresistible
a
hymn
of
triumph
of
hatred
on
their
lips
and
their
hearts
hot
for
blood
john
de
witt
rose
and
held
out
his
hand
before
him
as
if
sound
and
sight
were
real
and
so
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
attitude
of
an
orator
pleading
before
his
enemies
then
he
turned
quickly
from
the
window
and
walked
up
and
down
the
long
sunny
room
after
a
few
moments
he
stopped
and
took
down
a
bible
from
the
shelf
he
opened
it
but
before
his
eyes
were
still
the
furious
faces
of
his
countrymen
and
in
his
ears
the
ominous
sound
of
their
greedy
oncoming
hate
chapter
vii
i
will
maintain
the
new
stadtholder
took
his
seat
in
the
assembly
accepted
the
position
offered
him
swore
the
oaths
to
the
republic
tactfully
abstained
from
any
speech
and
merely
expressed
his
intention
of
returning
to
bodegraven
at
once
the
hague
was
in
a
frenzy
the
hero
of
the
moment
was
offered
a
triumph
a
banquet
a
he
declined
all
something
coldly
and
reminded
the
deputies
the
republic
was
in
no
condition
for
rejoicing
he
intended
obviously
to
avoid
as
much
as
possible
the
demonstrations
of
the
crowd
he
refused
a
public
entry
but
he
could
not
prevent
the
people
from
drinking
his
health
at
every
street
corner
and
sending
up
fireworks
as
soon
as
it
was
dark
as
he
left
the
assembly
fagel
advanced
to
speak
to
him
is
your
highness
satisfied
now
he
asked
eagerly
i
am
pleased
with
the
title
answered
the
prince
see
to
it
i
have
the
substance
i
will
be
no
duke
of
venice
the
secretary
could
not
but
remember
de
witt
s
words
of
that
certainly
they
would
find
no
puppet
ruler
in
william
of
orange
already
his
manner
had
changed
as
cold
as
composed
as
before
it
now
showed
openly
that
imperious
haughtiness
he
had
often
had
to
conceal
under
mere
reserve
or
enforced
graciousness
he
bore
himself
as
if
a
king
his
excessive
pride
might
not
deign
to
express
itself
in
any
outward
show
but
he
revealed
clearly
enough
that
if
he
was
to
be
the
deliverer
of
his
country
he
would
also
be
her
master
secure
in
the
support
of
the
people
he
could
do
as
he
pleased
with
the
magistrates
the
whole
country
was
at
his
mercy
those
who
had
been
in
opposition
to
him
trembled
his
enemies
were
in
despair
now
as
he
paused
on
the
stairs
to
speak
to
fagel
de
groot
came
out
of
the
room
of
the
assembly
mynheer
william
called
him
gaspard
fagel
shivered
pale
tired
but
erect
peter
de

came
forward
your
highness
the
stadtholder
was
drawing
on
his
gloves
i
advised
you
mynheer
not
to
undertake
that
journey
to
zeyst
you
remember
perfectly
your
well
the
prince
having
finished
with
his
gloves
removed
his
cane
from
under
his
arm
and
tapped
the
baluster
i
now
advise
you
to
leave
the

was
undaunted
i
am
aware
that
your
highness
blames
for
the
terms
of
peace
i
brought
from
the
king
of
france
i
would
rather
die
than
accept
them
but
as
an
ambassador
it
was
my
bare
duty
to
carry
them
to
their
noble
mightinesses
who
had
sent

replied
the
prince
unpleasantly
we
will
have
no
discussion
if
you
please
again
i
should
recommend
the
spanish
fagel
moved
instinctively
a
step
aside
but
peter
de
groot
stood
his
ground
he
saw
himself
a
fallen
man
a
ruined
man
and
a
slow
paleness
overspread
his
countenance
but
there
was
no
alteration
in
his
proud
demeanour
followed
by
mynheer
fagel
william

turned
away
without
a
salute
and
with
the
curtest
acknowledgment
of
the
councillors
and
nobles
gathered
about
him
passed
out
into
the
courtyard
of
the
binnenhof
it
was
too
late
to
return
to
the
camp
against
his
will
he
found
himself
obliged
to
stay
overnight
at
the
hague
his
own
palace
being
closed
william
was
lodged
in
the
splendid
house
almost
adjoining
the
binnenhof
where
prince
john
maurice
had
gathered
all
the
treasures
collected
in
his
travels
no
attendants
following
the
stadtholder
crossed
the
courtyard
and
gained
the
mansion
without
being
observed
by
any
dinner
was
already
served
in
the
gorgeous
where
the
old
prince
s
parrot
from
brazil
who
could
distinguish
a
black
man
from
a
white
could
swear
nicely
in
spanish
and
knew
his
master
for
a
great
man
swung
in
his
glittering
ebony
ring
heenvliet
was
in
attendance
and
a
few
of
prince
maurice
s
servants
has
mynheer
bentinck
arrived
asked
the
prince
not
yet
your
bentinck
had
been
sent
to
the
princess
amalia
with
the
news
of
her
grandson
s
triumph
nor
the
messenger
from
sir
gabriel
sylvius
no
highness
but
there
have
been
many
to
wait
upon
you
i
will
see
no
one
save
those
on
the
dark
bureau
a
heap
of
congratulatory
letters
had
already
accumulated
the
prince
picked
some
up
glanced
at
the
writings
and
laid
them
down
unopened
a
few
were
from
his
friends
many
from
his
enemies
some
from
people
he
did
not
know
at
all
he
put
aside
his
violet
velvet
cloak
his
cane
hat
and
gloves
and
opened
the
window
regardless
of
the
breeze
that
set
the
candles
guttering
it
was
a
beautiful
evening
clear
not
warm
for
july
the
sky
cloudless
and
a
fresh
wind
blowing
william
stood
holding
back
the
heavy
curtain
and
looking
out
at
the
dark
shapes
of
the
houses
above
which
now
and
then
a
shower
of
light
from
bonfire
or
rocket
rose
into
the
sky
the
excited
murmurs
from
the
crowds
filling
the
plein
came
distinctly
to
his
ears
he
could
almost
hear
them
shouting
his
name
heenvliet
had
withdrawn
for
the
moment
he
was
alone
but
there
came
no
change
into
the
perfect
calm
of
his
face
and
bearing
an
observer
might
have
well
thought
that
he
felt
no
emotion
and
concluded
that
to
feel
no
emotion
at
such
a
moment
was
indeed
to
show
himself
incapable
of
being
roused
by
any
feeling
ever
the
groote
kerk
struck
seven
william
left
the
window
and
went
to
the
table
glittering
with
glass
and
silver
the
sheen
of
china
and
the
sparkle
of
the
candles
in
the
gold
and
crimson
wines
the
parrot
gave
a
low
scream
and
eyed
him
in
friendly
fashion
william
looked
at
it
thoughtfully
it
had
a
drooping
air
as
if
it
knew
that
its
master
was
shut
up
with
the
garrison
in
maestricht
far
away
from
the
luxury
of
this
comfortable
room
with
its
persian
carpet
rich
hangings
valuable
pictures
and
statuary
it
had
also
an
air
of
that
moved
the
prince
s
admiration
he
crossed
to
its
ring
and
gently
stroked
its
head
the
bird
swung
itself
in
violent
agitation
of
some
kind
dropped
headlong
from
its
perch
and
with
a
sweep
of
its
gay
wing
cast
several
of
the
letters
on
the
bureau
at
william
s
feet
he
stooped
to
pick
them
up
the
writing
on
one
caught
his
eye
he
stared
at
it
a
moment
and
flushed
then
quickly
broke
it
open
it
was
matter
of
only
a
few
lines
when
he
had
read
it
he
took
up
his
hat
and
mantle
instantly
and
left
the
room
heenvliet
saw
him
passing
hastily
down
the
wide
stairs
and
could
hardly
credit
his
he
ran
after
him
but
the
prince
crossed
the
courtyard
without
looking
back
and
as
heenvliet
gained
the
gate
he
saw
the
slight
figure
disappearing
in
the
shadows
in
the
direction
of
the
plein
his
highness
gentleman
was
utterly
bewildered
as
he
stood
irresolute
hatless
at
the
gate
a
horseman
galloped
up
and
dismounted
heenvliet
knew
him
for
florent
van
mander
the
expected
messenger
from
sir
gabriel
sylvius
the
prince
began
the
newcomer
sir
cried
heenvliet
he
has
this
moment
left
the
house
alone
leaving
no
message
and
the
hague
in
this
commotion
he
was
about
to
sit
down
to
dinner
he
but
waited
bentinck
he
was
armed
with
only
a
i
will
go
after
dare
you
if
i
can
be
of
any
service
to
him
i
dare
anything
it
is
the
strangest
florent
was
already
resolved
what
was
he
wearing
a
violet
coat
and
mantle
a
black
hat
and
feather
see
to
the
horse
i
will
go
after
he
is
rash
the
streets
are
not
safe
while
heenvliet
was
still
half
urging
half
protesting
florent
started
at
a
run
across
the
plein
but
his
progress
was
soon
stopped
by
the
crowd
the
coaches
horsemen
and
soldiers
who
thronged
the
square
many
of
the
people
were
dancing
by
torchlight
before
their
houses
and
handing
out
wine
to
every
to
drink
the
health
of
the
new
stadtholder
the
crackling
of
fireworks
mingled
with
the
murmurs
and
the
shouts
hawkers
were
selling
copies
of
pamphlets
against
john
de
witt
and
the
dying
speech
of
jacob
van
der
graef
who
was
held
up
as
a
martyr
to
the
orange
cause
it
was
a
riot
of
enthusiastic
joy
every
one
wore
an
orange
ribbon
and
from
every
house
steeple
booth
and
coach
waved
the
orange
flag
florent
forced
to
pause
remembered
that
he
had
absolutely
no
clue
to
the
prince
s
destination
but
as
he
made
his
way
on
through
the
press
as
best
he
could
he
reminded
himself
that
william
would
also
find
crossing
the
plein
a
difficult
matter
he
looked
eagerly
round
through
the
confusion
of
twilight
torchlight
and
the
steadier
gleam
of
lantern
and
presently
noticed
a
gentleman
in
a
violet
mantle
making
a
slow
way
through
a
group
of
burghers
gathering
round
the
open
door
of
a
tavern
van
mander
forced
himself
as
near
as
he
could
get
not
near
enough
to
be
finally
the
violet
cavalier
turned
down
the
houtestraat
with
florent
not
far
behind
it
was
less
crowded
here
and
by
the
time
they
had
reached
the
kalvermarkt
van
mander
had
his
man
clear
but
suddenly
the
gentleman
in
violet
stopped
to
ask
his
way
of
a
man
seated
outside
a
grocery
shop
and
upon
receiving
the
answer
turned
so
quickly
down
an
side
street
that
florent
lost
sight
of
him
breaking
into
a
run
he
plunged
down
the
dark
turning
his
spurs
clattering
on
the
cobbles
the
street
was
almost
empty
the
houses
dark
for
the
inhabitants
were
gathered
in
the
principal
thoroughfares
florent
was
brought
to
a
stop
in
a
lonely
little
square
planted
with
chestnut
trees
he
looked
up
and
saw
an
orange
flag
projected
from
a
gabled
window
from
which
issued
the
ruddy
light
of
a
lamp
that
stained
the
folds
to
a
deep
brilliance
against
the
purple
colour
of
the
evening
sky
at
the
door
of
this
house
stood
an
old
man
in
a
white
ruff
smoking
florent
addressed
him
has
a
gentleman
wearing
violet
been
past
here
mynheer
a
moment
ago
which
way
did
he
take
florent
asked
eagerly
for
the
square
was
divided
by
a
canal
the
old
man
was
laconic
he
asked
the
to
the
heeren
which
is
round
the
corner
is
it
not
did
you
see
this
gentleman
s
face
the
other
began
to
grow
suspicious
what
did
you
want
with
him
florent
did
not
hesitate
i
am
a
servant
of
his
at
least
if
it
be
he
whom
i
think
and
am
come
after
him
with
a
well
said
the
old
man
he
was
not
tall
nor
stout
he
was
young
and
thin
with
a
hooked
nose
like
his
highness
the
stadtholder
has
then
he
is
my
master
said
florent
and
hurried
on
as
he
turned
the
length
of
the
dark
canal
he
saw
by
the
light
of
the
lamps
with
which
it
was
set
the
violet
mantle
not
far
away
from
him
its
owner
appeared
to
be
hesitating
and
endeavouring
to
distinguish
the
signs
displayed
on
the
tall
van
mander
rather
breathless
ran
up
to
him
there
was
no
one
else
in
sight
your
highness
the
prince
turned
sharply
before
he
could
speak
florent
went
on
sir
you
must
forgive
me
it
is
i
van
i
rode
up
as
you
left
the
i
followed
somewhat
to
his
surprise
the
prince
seemed
neither
astonished
nor
angry
why
he
asked
in
an
absorbed
fashion
sir
it
is
if
you
knew
what
i
know
what
i
heard
at
i
am
safe
enough
said
william
still
gazing
up
at
the
houses
there
are
plots
abroad
to
assassinate
your
without
doubt
the
prince
replied
absently
i
wish
to
find
a
house
that
hath
for
sign
a
pair
of
scales
it
is
somewhere
near
here
i
on
what
adventure
is
your
highness
engaged
demanded
florent
anxiously
it
seemed
to
him
that
william
neither
knew
nor
cared
who
spoke
to
him
he
showed
no
sign
of
remembering
that
he
awaited
news
from
sir
gabriel
he
appeared
to
be
entirely
engaged
in
the
matter
on
hand
now
how
may
we
find
it
was
his
sole
comment
as
he
turned
impatiently
along
the
canal
it
is
too
dark
to
see
the
sign
a
few
houses
have
lamps
above
the
door
said
florent
help
me
to
look
i
would
rather
charge
a
thousand
men
with
a
hundred
than
lose
an
hour
the
prince
took
florent
s
presence
as
a
matter
of
course
neither
desiring
nor
resenting
it
they
proceeded
in
silence
along
the
stone
causeway
florent
was
the
first
to
catch
the
gleam
of
a
pair
of
gilt
scales
dangling
over
the
low
portico
of
one
of
the
doors
shall
i
wait
here
for
your
highness
he
asked
you
may
enter
if
you
still
the
prince
gave
the
impression
of
being
so
absorbed
in
some
particular
affair
that
he
did
not
know
to
whom
he
spoke
but
as
they
waited
on
the
winged
steps
after
having
hastily
knocked
he
suddenly
explained
himself
my
old
tutor
mynheer
cornelius
triglandt
wrote
to
me
that
he
was
lying
ill
here
i
did
not
even
know
that
he
was
at
the
florent
looked
sharply
at
the
prince
after
all
despite
his
gravity
reserve
and
caution
william
had
then
an
honest
simplicity
and
with
all
his
pride
the
frankness
of
and
the
winning
modesty
of
youth
and
quick
affection
the
door
was
opened
by
a
girl
wearing
a
garnet
necklace
a
white
cap
and
long
gold
earrings
glimmering
in
the
mynheer
cornelius
triglandt
is
here
asked
the
prince
quickly
yes
she
opened
the
door
wider
and
they
passed
into
the
cedarwood
hall
is
he
very
ill
questioned
william
the
maiden
looked
at
them
with
a
faint
surprise
i
do
not
think
that
he
expects
any
one
to
visit
him
no
the
prince
s
voice
was
gentler
than
florent
had
thought
it
could
be
but
he
will
be
glad
to
see
the
girl
hesitated
with
her
hand
on
the
newel
post
who
shall
i
say
is
here
to
triglandt
she
asked
the
prince
stood
in
a
slightly
awkward
fashion
holding
his
hat
across
his
chest
he
fixed
the
speaker
with
his
luminous
eyes
in
a
bewildered
manner
the
girl
glanced
over
him
took
in
his
velvet
mantle
his
fringed
gloves
his
shoes
with
the
stiff
satin
bows
m
triglandt
is
a
friend
of
the
stadtholder
she
said
half
defiantly
and
you
look
to
me
like
one
of
de
witt
s
is
he
alone
asked
william
abruptly
yes
the
doctor
has
been
and
gone
he
says
he
can
not
live
the
night
i
have
been
sitting
with
you
are
a
good
girl
said
the
prince
now
i
will
relieve
her
face
brightened
ah
i
can
go
to
the
fair
on
the
plein
i
had
promised
to
go
but
could
not
when
a
poor
old
man
lay
there
are
great
rejoicings
are
there
not
because
of
his
the
prince
gave
her
an
absent
look
yes
you
can
go
though
this
is
no
time
for
rejoicing
with
the
french
on
the
border
tell
triglandt
it
is
his
pupil
come
to
see
his
pupil
she
echoed
and
went
lightly
up
the
stairs
william
turned
to
florent
i
am
glad
the
people
are
good
to
him
he
said
impulsively
he
escaped
from
arnheim
just
before
the
french
the
girl
called
softly
over
the
banisters
will
you
come
up
mynheeren
they
ascended
the
smooth
steps
and
on
a
landing
where
a
brass
lamp
burnt
she
pointed
them
to
a
door
i
will
go
out
now
not
for
long
she
said
excusing
herself
my
mother
is
below
and
our
servant
and
there
are
other
she
smiled
and
with
a
little
courtesy
pattered
down
the
stairs
william
pushed
open
the
door
it
led
into
a
chamber
lined
with
cedar
and
empty
save
for
a
few
chairs
directly
opposite
a
second
door
stood
open
upon
a
bedroom
full
of
candlelight
the
prince
went
forward
but
florent
hung
back
and
remained
in
the
unlit
shadows
william
stepped
breathlessly
into
the
light
he
found
a
lofty
apartment
illumined
by
a
row
of
candles
set
on
a
black
bureau
the
windows
were
flung
wide
on
to
the
summer
night
the
canal
and
the
lime
trees
the
stars
and
a
great
moon
that
hung
low
above
the
silent
houses
close
to
the
candles
stood
a
blue
bowl
of
and
roses
sideways
to
the
window
was
a
bed
curtained
in
patterned
chintz
and
on
it
lay
an
elderly
man
whose
firm
face
was
turned
expectantly
towards
the
door
mynheer
triglandt
exclaimed
the
prince
casting
down
his
hat
and
gloves
your
highness
the
words
came
with
a
deep
note
of
joy
and
passion
the
sick
man
s
face
utterly
changed
into
an
expression
of
rapture
ah
why
did
i
not
know
before
william
exclaimed
he
came
to
the
bedside
and
pulled
back
the
curtains
triglandt
held
out
his
thin
hands
and
grasped
the
prince
s
i
have
not
been
here
arnheim
was
sacked
they
killed
he
tried
to
kiss
the
stadtholder
s
hands
william
prevented
him
and
dropped
on
his
knees
beside
the
low
bed
you
are
ill
how
do
i
find
you
that
your
highness
should
think
of
me
it
is
i
tried
to
do
what
i
could
for
the
people
out
there
you
would
not
believe
the
cruelties
william
ground
his
teeth
i
took
the
fever
there
was
not
enough
they
mutilated
the
people
as
in
farnese
s
the
calvinist
pastor
drew
himself
painfully
up
i
have
seen
our
churches
burnt
and
heard
mass
he
gasped
and
stared
down
into
the
agonised
face
of
the
young
man
kneeling
at
his
bedside
it
seemed
god
had
turned
his
face
from
us
but
i
knew
that
he
would
raise
your
highness
up
to
be
our
william
coloured
and
trembled
that
you
should
come
here
to
see
me
whispered
triglandt
in
a
tone
of
infinite
tenderness
now
i
shall
die
very
you
must
not
die
replied
the
prince
i
have
so
much
to
how
many
years
since
we
saw
each
other
and
you
taught
me
of
the
ancient
saints
he
caught
his
breath
eagerly
and
how
they
endured
and
the
true
happiness
they
had
not
so
long
said
the
tutor
but
now
your
highness
has
moustaches
and
a
sword
and
is
a
great
he
smiled
faintly
yet
you
are
still
like
your
i
did
not
hope
to
see
you
again
of
all
nights
i
have
heard
the
people
shouting
for
the
true
house
the
prince
answered
passionately
what
is
their
rejoicing
to
me
this
is
rather
a
time
for
prayer
the
country
is
almost
oh
god
who
hears
me
almost
lost
he
pushed
back
the
hair
from
his
forehead
and
looked
up
into
the
white
face
of
the
pastor
his
coldness
had
left
him
completely
he
was
all
fire
and
eagerness
passion
and
agony
florent
motionless
in
the
outer
shadows
stared
at
him
in
an
enthralled
amazement
mynheer
you
used
to
tell
me
that
my
ancestors
had
been
heroes
that
god
had
appointed
them
to
guard
his
i
want
to
do
as
they
i
want
to
save
the
country
and
the
reformed
the
odds
are
fearful
no
one
understands
not
even
the
suppressed
emotion
of
years
strove
to
express
itself
but
long
silence
had
put
it
beyond
expression
william
speaking
to
the
man
to
whom
he
had
given
his
rare
love
had
to
force
the
very
soul
of
him
into
words
you
know
you
told
me
it
seemed
possible
i
might
do
this
thing
no
one
understands
if
they
did
they
would
laugh
but
know
de
witt
never
trusted
me
he
thought
i
meant
to
play
the
traitor
with
france
it
was
the
last
insult
they
believed
you
saw
how
utterly
unhappy
i
was
i
would
have
died
gladly
but
now
three
provinces
gone
you
have
heard
the
terms
but
never
not
slavery
again
no
romish
rule
for
us
triglandt
looked
at
him
with
sparkling
eyes
you
have
refused
yes
breathed
william
the
negotiations
still
hang
but
now
i
have
the
power
i
shall
refuse
ah
will
not
laugh
at
he
caught
the
sick
man
s
hand
in
his
cold
fingers
i
am
not
quick
nor
clever
he
said
with
his
soul
in
his
voice
nor
a
soldier
like
de
condé
nor
a
statesman
like
de
louvois
but
i
can
endure
and
wait
and
take
any
hardship
so
that
i
attain
my
end
and
do
you
not
believe
that
god
will
help
me
mynheer
triglandt
with
all
my
soul
i
do
believe
that
he
has
set
your
highness
in
this
place
to
be
his
the
pastor
raised
himself
still
higher
his
haggard
features
glowed
with
an
earnest
rapture
you
have
before
you
a
long
and
difficult
task
but
a
holy
one
you
will
need
to
be
strong
and
resolute
and
calm
you
have
half
europe
to
hearten
half
europe
to
speak
to
me
cried
william
speak
to
me
like
that
the
old
man
stared
at
the
row
of
candles
on
the
black
bureau
his
pale
blue
eyes
were
clear
and
shining
this
is
a
dark
hour
a
time
of
misery
of
bitterness
of
despair
the
tyrant
triumphs
vanity
lust
and
blood
walk
hand
in
hand
across
our
land
but
god
who
planted
in
your
breast
this
fervour
will
not
patiently
endure
the
blasphemer
you
can
save
his
faith
you
can
raise
his
land
from
bondage
you
can
be
the
captain
of
his
armies
you
can
humble
the
arrogant
break
the
power
of
france
and
establish
a
freedom
the
world
has
never
yet
he
turned
his
luminous
gaze
on
to
the
upturned
face
of
the
young
prince
who
seemed
to
have
hushed
his
very
breath
to
listen
your
way
will
not
be
easy
there
will
be
dangers
disappointments
sneers
oppositions
failures
you
must
taste
humiliation
you
must
endure
sickness
you
must
have
great
patience
and
great
courage
when
you
long
for
peace
you
will
be
driven
into
the
combat
very
few
will
understand
there
will
be
railing
calumny
factions
to
be
met
and
silenced
i
see
ahead
down
the
years
and
i
see
this
struggles
bitterness
despair
but
in
your
heart
you
will
know
that
you
are
the
elect
of
god
and
that
you
fight
his
there
was
a
tense
silence
slowly
in
a
low
voice
at
last
the
prince
answered
i
will
try
to
be
he
dropped
his
face
into
his
hands
and
hid
it
against
the
coverlet
triglandt
lightly
stroked
the
long
brown
locks
and
i
see
something
of
your
reward
too
i
see
this
land
a
refuge
for
god
s
people
i
see
them
bless
your
name
in
sickness
and
defeat
it
shall
comfort
you
that
you
have
so
protected
the
reformed
religion
that
she
shall
never
be
in
danger
again
you
will
have
opened
the
floodgates
of
liberty
and
no
one
shall
close
them
he
gasped
struggling
with
his
breath
then
his
clear
inspired
voice
went
on
maybe
you
will
die
before
this
reward
comes
maybe
you
will
never
see
the
result
of
your
labours
men
may
never
give
you
the
honour
but
yours
will
be
the
glory
if
now
you
dare
what
no
other
man
does
dare
or
will
william
looked
up
his
face
was
changed
almost
distorted
i
will
do
it
i
am
often
ill
but
i
can
put
a
good
face
on
it
i
shall
live
long
enough
to
do
my
people
will
misunderstand
you
must
not
care
to
this
one
thing
be
true
you
must
forego
pleasure
ease
popularity
i
will
do
it
repeated
the
prince
in
a
choking
voice
speak
to
me
bless
me
there
is
no
other
who
nevermore
shall
i
speak
to
any
as
now
i
speak
to
you
to
you
who
leave
what
more
can
i
say
your
own
soul
will
guide
you
be
tolerant
be
just
be
true
to
your
word
be
patient
and
be
i
will
not
falter
i
will
not
despair
even
though
i
go
forth
alone
and
never
reach
the
the
prince
s
voice
failed
him
he
covered
his
face
and
his
shoulders
heaved
triglandt
lay
back
on
the
white
fragrant
pillows
i
can
speak
no
more
he
said
faintly
you
know
the
william
spoke
without
raising
his
head
stay
with
me
a
little
for
i
love
ah
heaven
pity
me
i
am
so
lonely
god
god
has
set
you
the
prince
looked
up
the
hazel
eyes
were
full
of
tears
i
will
be
resolute
i
will
be
calm
only
if
you
could
i
am
dying
but
you
will
not
forget
me
nor
how
i
the
tears
ran
down
the
young
man
s
cheeks
he
trembled
violently
i
love
you
no
one
else
i
think
if
you
could
stay
and
see
how
i
obey
the
pastor
smiled
faintly
i
am
very
william
caught
his
hands
mynheer
triglandt
he
cried
in
a
tone
of
terror
i
am
afraid
can
i
do
it
they
all
look
to
me
to
save
them
de
witt
passes
on
to
me
his
hopeless
task
to
save
them
he
cowered
against
the
bed
i
feel
as
if
my
soul
fainted
but
i
will
not
fail
them
ah
heart
heart
god
will
inspire
you
gasped
the
pastor
he
i
trust
in
him
if
he
should
try
me
with
bitternesses
i
will
try
to
submit
but
sometimes
yesterday
i
saw
an
old
man
on
the
rhine
struggling
with
a
barge
and
as
it
advanced
a
little
it
was
swept
back
and
he
strove
again
and
once
more
gained
an
inch
and
was
driven
back
and
as
i
watched
he
made
a
little
desperate
headway
my
affairs
are
even
as
that
poor
man
s
i
must
strive
and
strive
and
be
content
if
with
much
labour
i
gain
a
he
staggered
to
his
feet
and
bent
low
over
the
pillow
what
can
i
do
for
you
he
whispered
he
was
sobbing
bitterly
nothing
do
not
the
old
man
caught
his
coat
and
arm
i
am
content
he
said
i
dreamt
of
this
when
de
witt
divided
us
because
i
taught
you
who
you
there
fell
a
soft
meaning
silence
there
could
be
heard
the
faint
peal
of
the
coming
through
the
summer
william
supported
the
old
man
in
a
trembling
embrace
triglandt
caught
one
of
the
loose
curls
that
hung
over
the
prince
s
shoulder
and
pressed
it
to
his
lips
then
his
hands
clasped
tightly
on
his
breast
he
nodded
like
one
falling
asleep
then
suddenly
his
eyes
opened
wide
say
god
bless
you
sobbed
the
prince
desperately
god
bless
you
god
be
with
you
he
gathered
sudden
energy
he
smiled
and
raised
his
right
hand
thou
art
king
o
god
send
help
unto
jacob
through
thee
will
we
overthrow
our
enemies
and
in
thy
name
will
we
tread
them
under
that
rise
up
against
us
for
we
will
not
trust
in
our
the
dying
man
s
voice
swelled
with
exaltation
it
is
not
our
sword
that
shall
help
us
but
it
is
who
savest
us
from
our
enemies
and
puttest
them
to
confusion
that
hate
he
fell
into
soft
yet
triumphant
accents
we
will
make
our
boast
of
god
all
day
long
and
will
praise
thy
name
for
his
hand
sank
william
my
triglandt
closed
his
eyes
his
breath
was
almost
stilled
outside
the
rang
and
the
stadtholder
cast
himself
across
the
homely
bed
in
a
passionate
agony
of
bitter
tears
god
be
merciful
to
me
a
sinner
and
alone
chapter
viii
the
stadtholder
a
heavy
mist
of
vapour
lay
over
the
camp
at
bodegraven
the
vivid
green
meadows
lay
flat
to
the
sky
a
white
cottage
with
painted
shutters
a
porch
and
a
garden
full
of
and
roses
poppies
and
herbs
stood
by
a
clump
of
alders
amid
the
tents
and
pickets
above
it
floated
the
orange
flag
in
one
of
its
small
rooms
the
young
stadtholder
sat
his
elbow
on
the
table
his
brow
in
his
hand
de
zuylestein
and
william
bentinck
stood
by
the
open
window
and
florent
van
mander
was
speaking
with
a
force
and
an
energy
to
which
he
had
never
before
been
roused
if
your
highness
would
his
highness
would
consider
nothing
cornelius
triglandt
had
died
in
his
arms
at
dawn
that
day
and
already
time
was
closing
over
the
event
but
not
over
the
pain
van
mander
addressed
himself
to
the
two
gentlemen
in
the
window
embrasure
i
swear
to
you
these
overtures
were
made
to
me
in
zeyst
will
you
take
no
heed
of
them
de
zuylestein
frowned
what
you
say
amounts
to
this
that
some
agents
of
king
louis
have
broached
to
you
a
scheme
for
the
assassination
of
his
van
mander
answered
firmly
i
journeyed
straight
to
the
hague
to
inform
the
prince
i
have
had
till
now
no
opportunity
of
inwardly
he
was
referring
to
the
past
night
he
could
have
cried
out
the
great
pride
and
joy
he
felt
in
serving
a
prince
who
had
revealed
himself
at
the
of
cornelius
triglandt
a
master
whom
he
knew
at
last
he
longed
to
prove
his
devotion
to
die
for
the
prince
and
the
country
he
burned
with
shame
when
he
recalled
that
he
had
once
tampered
with
france
madame
lavalette
is
at
the
bottom
of
he
continued
his
narration
and
one
hyacinthe
she
hath
a
spite
against
his
de
louvois
thinks
there
could
be
no
greater
disaster
to
the
country
than
the
loss
of
the
they
approached
me
he
paused
because
i
had
formerly
dealings
with
croix
he
added
with
an
effort
the
stadtholder
raised
swollen
eyes
let
it
be
he
said
wearily
bentinck
interrupted
sir
you
must
take
some
notice
of
this
it
is
beneath
me
to
consider
my
own
safety
said
william
in
the
same
tone
van
mander
approached
the
table
earnestly
this
is
deep
there
is
one
michael
tichelaer
in
it
a
dutch
barber
a
higher
name
than
his
i
will
not
hear
it
replied
the
prince
with
impatience
this
is
mere
bravado
exclaimed
de
zuylestein
we
have
other
things
to
occupy
us
replied
the
prince
sir
declared
van
mander
ardently
i
must
insist
that
you
listen
to
once
more
the
french
will
send
you
terms
should
you
again
refuse
them
they
have
resolved
to
compass
your
the
stadtholder
was
still
indifferent
these
plots
are
hatched
against
every
man
of
there
is
danger
at
home
as
well
as
in
the
french
camp
insisted
florent
a
great
name
was
whose
asked
bentinck
eagerly
that
of
cornelius
de
the
prince
looked
up
sharply
roused
at
length
by
this
impossible
he
exclaimed
i
spoke
with
the
fellow
he
had
confided
in
van
mander
answered
this
michael
tichelaer
who
saw
him
soon
after
your
highness
was
proclaimed
in
he
was
very
precise
de
witt
railed
against
your
highness
said
you
would
marry
a
foreign
princess
and
make
yourself
absolute
in
the
united
provinces
and
to
prevent
this
and
to
bring
the
republicans
back
to
power
he
desired
this
tichelaer
to
go
to
the
camp
and
kill
your
highness
the
stadtholder
interrupted
i
believe
none
of
bentinck
however
was
not
so
sure
at
least
investigate
the
but
all
further
speech
was
arrested
by
the
announcement
of
the
expected
envoys
from
the
allies
de
zuylestein
drew
van
mander
aside
i
will
see
you
afterwards
your
tale
requires
looking
into
particularly
as
regards
de
witt
the
prince
is
too
it
was
sir
gabriel
sylvius
who
brought
the
final
answer
from
king
louis
the
terms
that
william
iii
hoped
through
the
intervening
influence
of
the
english
might
prove
more
reasonable
sir
gabriel
was
accompanied
by
jermyn
and
an
englishman
very
different
from
either
buckingham
or
arlington
sir
edward
seymour
of
the
proudest
name
in
the
three
kingdoms
the
young
stadtholder
received
them
with
perfect
composure
all
trace
of
weariness
left
his
manner
your
highness
began
sir
gabriel
i
bring
to
you
the
final
conditions
of
peace
of
the
kings
of
france
and
he
handed
the
prince
a
letter
i
would
advise
your
highness
not
to
look
at
it
till
you
have
dined
i
fear
it
will
not
please
william
swept
a
glance
over
the
assembled
faces
then
tore
open
the
envelope
it
contained
a
letter
from
the
two
english
ministers
and
a
copy
of
a
treaty
recently
drawn
up
at
heeswyck
between
charles
and
louis
in
which
the
two
monarchs
agreed
to
press
their
demands
in
concert
and
not
to
enter
into
any
separate
treaty
with
the
republic
whom
they
thus
hoped
to
reduce
to
extremity
turning
from
this
document
which
destroyed
all
his
hopes
of
detaching
charles
from
the
french
alliance
william
cast
his
eyes
over
the
articles
of
peace
they
stood
the
same
as
before
save
that
to
the
haughty
demands
of
france
were
added
the
immoderate
claims
of
england
a
passionate
colour
rushed
into
the
young
stadtholder
s
thin
cheek
he
gave
a
stifled
exclamation
and
for
a
second
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
tear
the
papers
across
and
fling
them
in
the
face
of
the
envoys
who
had
brought
them
but
he
controlled
himself
and
made
a
movement
as
if
he
would
have
thrust
them
into
the
breast
of
his
coat
forgetting
he
wore
a
cuirass
recollecting
himself
he
flung
the
documents
down
on
the
table
your
highness
sir
edward
addressed
him
coming
forward
we
are
directed
to
ask
for
your
answer
and
the
answer
of
the
states
within
ten
william
looked
at
him
and
saw
a
gentleman
handsome
and
proud
with
languid
brown
eyes
and
dressed
richly
in
a
travelling
costume
you
are
sir
edward
seymour
queried
the
stadtholder
the
englishman
bowed
why
are
you
sent
here
sir
edward
demanded
william
sir
gabriel
could
have
brought
the
dispatch
the
bluntness
of
this
slightly
discomposed
sir
edward
s
stateliness
he
made
a
little
motion
with
his
towards
the
dutch
nobles
these
are
in
your
highness
confidence
oh
say
what
you
have
to
say
sir
edward
cried
the
prince
impatiently
seymour
was
considering
him
curiously
my
lord
buckingham
made
an
offer
to
your
highness
which
i
in
the
hope
of
detaching
the
english
from
the
french
alliance
added
sir
edward
you
now
see
sir
that
such
a
hope
is
well
it
is
my
embassage
to
repeat
that
offer
to
your
highness
to
show
the
consideration
in
which
their
majesties
hold
you
they
again
offer
you
the
sovereignty
of
holland
in
exchange
for
the
towns
not
yet
in
king
louis
william
iii
looked
at
him
straightly
i
thank
you
and
your
master
for
these
proposals
he
said
coldly
but
they
are
renewed
hours
too
yesterday
i
took
an
oath
of
fidelity
to
the
states
as
you
have
my
sir
edward
bowed
i
may
remind
your
highness
that
you
stand
in
a
desperate
almost
a
hopeless
the
prince
answered
proudly
i
am
not
by
nature
timorous
sir
edward
and
do
not
fear
to
have
to
fight
for
have
you
well
considered
william
interrupted
sir
i
would
rather
spend
the
rest
of
my
life
hunting
on
one
of
my
german
estates
than
sell
my
country
for
any
price
that
could
be
sir
edward
was
not
as
buckingham
nor
even
as
arlington
he
bowed
again
this
time
with
an
air
of
respect
every
one
was
silent
holding
himself
with
reserve
the
slanting
ray
of
sun
that
fell
through
the
open
lattice
window
laden
with
the
scent
of
the
roses
and
seemed
incongruous
with
this
contained
and
grave
assembly
the
prince
turned
about
as
if
considering
something
they
felt
that
he
was
going
to
speak
and
waited
for
it
seymour
regarded
him
keenly
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
knows
and
values
what
he
sees
the
stadtholder
paused
by
the
table
and
rested
his
beautiful
hand
upon
the
papers
his
messenger
had
brought
you
shall
have
an
answer
in
less
than
ten
days
he
said
i
will
take
these
terms
myself
to
the
assembly
he
paused
and
drew
himself
erect
with
something
of
an
effort
his
reddened
eyes
flashed
with
an
intense
expression
of
dauntless
defiance
he
spoke
again
and
with
irresistible
force
the
king
of
france
considers
it
a
fine
amusement
to
ruin
an
unoffending
country
he
thinks
it
will
be
easy
to
crush
a
petty
prince
you
my
lords
doubtless
pity
me
my
vain
resistance
but
you
know
not
what
you
smile
at
the
french
insult
us
with
outrageous
terms
not
cæsar
to
the
gauls
nor
alexander
to
the
persians
was
more
haughty
but
we
are
not
as
darius
france
will
repent
this
insolence
we
will
from
this
little
spark
blow
up
a
war
shall
see
europe
in
arms
and
shake
the
continent
no
peace
they
say
but
they
shall
come
to
sue
for
it
be
it
thirty
years
or
fifty
years
hence
there
is
a
force
can
hold
back
condé
s
cavalry
and
keep
in
check
the
battalions
turenne
leads
there
is
a
strength
can
pit
itself
against
these
servitors
of
the
pope
and
match
itself
against
the
pride
of
france
and
from
this
conquered
land
it
springs
long
and
bloody
the
struggle
may
be
that
forces
the
aggressor
back
across
his
frontier
but
it
will
break
his
pride
and
he
shall
come
to
wish
that
he
had
taken
our
honourable
terms
for
by
my
soul
as
i
am
captain
of
my
country
s
hopes
and
of
their
faith
the
protector
i
shall
not
sheathe
the
sword
until
this
presuming
arrogance
is
tamed
and
europe
breathes
in
liberty
we
are
not
vanquished
yet
though
they
reckon
we
are
beneath
their
heel
yet
we
will
show
them
otherwise
we
are
no
nation
of
weaklings
nor
am
i
a
puppet
ruler
i
am
the
guardian
of
this
republic
and
i
will
be
worthy
of
the
charge
so
help
me
god
my
lords
there
is
no
more
to
a
long
minute
s
stillness
followed
then
sir
edward
seymour
spoke
i
do
not
trespass
on
my
duty
if
i
say
that
i
admire
the
temper
that
your
highness
shows
i
should
be
pleased
to
be
as
fortunate
as
king
louis
but
better
pleased
to
be
as
courageous
as
your
thank
you
my
lord
answered
william
i
hope
that
we
may
meet
again
under
fairer
he
held
out
his
hand
and
sir
edward
kissed
it
bowed
very
courtly
and
withdrew
followed
by
jermyn
his
suite
and
the
dutch
nobles
who
formed
his
escort
the
stadtholder
coughing
turned
to
the
mantelpiece
and
put
his
hand
over
his
aching
eyes
bentinck
i
must
return
to
the
hague
at
with
these
dispatches
yes
the
states
must
assemble
zuylestein
stepped
forward
this
assassination
plot
can
i
think
of
that
now
m
cornelius
de
witt
is
involved
i
do
not
believe
this
impatiently
with
a
frown
florent
van
mander
came
from
the
window
embrasure
and
went
on
one
knee
on
the
floor
william
looked
at
him
and
hesitated
to
speak
harshly
this
young
man
seemed
to
him
a
link
with
the
past
night
he
had
been
witness
of
his
william
bit
his
and
listened
florent
told
his
story
hurriedly
but
clearly
madame
lavalette
under
the
guise
of
a
traveller
from
brussels
accompanied
by
croix
and
michael
tichelaer
as
her
servants
was
to
take
up
her
quarters
in
some
village
near
the
prince
s
florent
broke
off
he
looked
at
zuylestein
william
was
not
attending
the
matter
is
serious
cried
van
mander
desperately
the
stadtholder
did
not
seem
to
know
that
the
narrative
had
ceased
highness
said
bentinck
william
was
looking
at
the
dispatches
on
the
table
i
will
hear
it
presently
he
said
presently
may
be
too
late
florent
was
again
interrupted
a
messenger
from
the
hague
with
a
letter
from
de
witt
the
prince
flushed
at
sight
of
the
writing
and
was
breaking
the
seal
when
an
officer
entered
to
say
that
a
private
messenger
from
king
charles
desired
a
secret
audience
of
the
prince
william
cast
down
the
letter
and
listened
eagerly
it
had
always
been
his
passionate
hope
to
detach
his
uncle
from
the
king
of
france
who
was
it
a
frenchman
who
had
his
passport
and
credentials
and
had
shown
them
to
count
the
stadtholder
would
see
him
at
once
he
turned
all
save
bentinck
from
the
room
he
knew
that
charles
liked
to
act
under
a
mask
of
secrecy
though
you
may
smiled
william
listen
at
the
he
was
all
animation
hope
and
eagerness
if
charles
should
come
to
secret
terms
the
republic
was
saved
florent
very
pale
still
urged
his
interrupted
tale
this
may
be
the
very
man
afterwards
said
william
afterwards
the
messenger
was
introduced
a
frenchman
of
commonplace
exterior
his
demeanour
very
humble
the
stadtholder
alone
with
him
save
for
bentinck
spoke
with
impetuous
frankness
what
does
my
uncle
want
of
me
i
will
do
anything
consistent
with
my
vows
to
the
arlington
had
sent
an
extraordinary
proposal
lord
halifax
was
in
the
king
s
confidence
he
said
and
was
now
in
would
the
prince
meet
him
unknown
to
the
french
secretly
william
gave
an
immediate
consent
but
bentinck
interrupted
you
are
dangerously
rash
highness
this
man
s
tale
is
strange
and
his
errand
still
stranger
for
a
frenchman
to
have
come
upon
sir
edward
seymour
gave
you
no
hint
of
but
the
prince
was
dazzled
by
the
bait
i
can
refuse
no
chance
of
coming
to
an
agreement
with
king
he
turned
to
the
messenger
but
before
his
first
word
the
door
was
opened
and
florent
van
mander
entered
his
hand
on
his
sword
and
his
face
resolute
sir
that
man
is
hyacinthe
croix
a
tool
of
de
pomponne
a
spy
of
de
louvois
an
assassin
croix
saw
himself
betrayed
by
a
man
whom
he
had
been
very
sure
of
his
face
lowered
with
the
rage
of
it
but
he
had
his
answer
does
your
highness
allow
your
private
business
to
be
thus
interrupted
the
stadtholder
looked
from
one
to
another
bentinck
came
nearer
to
him
this
is
the
plot
of
which
i
warned
your
highness
the
attempt
to
get
you
into
the
power
of
your
enemies
to
compass
your
death
cried
florent
hotly
croix
affected
to
sneer
i
do
not
know
the
man
will
your
highness
listen
to
these
children
s
tales
do
not
know
me
i
have
some
letters
of
william
marked
croix
expression
by
your
leave
monsieur
he
said
i
will
look
into
the
frenchman
saw
the
game
was
up
he
seized
his
last
flying
quick
his
little
keen
dagger
was
out
and
he
made
a
swift
movement
to
thrust
it
above
the
armlet
of
the
prince
s
cuirass
there
where
by
a
little
unguarded
space
the
heart
might
be
reached
florent
threw
himself
upon
with
a
passionate
sound
of
rage
against
the
stolid
hollander
who
had
roused
at
last
croix
turned
there
was
a
second
s
struggle
the
sunlight
winked
along
the
florent
pitched
over
backwards
with
closed
eyes
and
an
open
mouth
croix
tore
the
door
wide
and
fled
the
thing
had
not
taken
two
minutes
it
was
less
than
ten
since
croix
had
entered
the
room
the
prince
and
william
bentinck
caught
van
mander
he
was
right
cried
william
fiercely
the
man
was
one
of
louvois
murderers
said
bentinck
he
has
stabbed
the
the
handle
of
the
dagger
silver
and
ivory
stuck
out
horribly
from
the
breast
of
florent
van
mander
who
gasped
thickly
and
beat
his
heels
on
the
tiles
ah
poor
fool
muttered
william
supporting
him
he
was
saving
me
after
the
frenchman
bentinck
florent
clutched
at
the
with
convulsive
fingers
take
care
de
witt
tichelaer
he
struggled
but
the
prince
for
all
his
frail
look
supported
him
easily
enough
i
am
sorry
for
this
he
said
i
am
florent
van
mander
selfish
careless
of
his
country
and
in
the
pay
of
france
once
has
died
for
a
sentiment
of
honour
in
the
stadtholder
s
arms
even
as
last
night
he
had
seen
cornelius
triglandt
can
william
of
orange
so
inspire
one
man
then
he
may
so
inspire
a
whole
nation
with
the
last
desperate
courage
if
florent
van
mander
will
die
for
him
there
will
be
others
also
reckless
of
their
lives
if
they
may
serve
nassau
by
laying
them
it
is
calling
to
horse
now
riding
to
and
fro
excitement
rising
up
reined
the
last
defiance
has
been
flung
to
france
the
states
must
refuse
these

stadtholder
thrusts
the
dispatches
and
the
letter
from
de
witt
unopened

the
pocket
of
his
mantle

his
grey
horse

along

the
full
dazzle
of
their
gorgeous

sat
the

and
the

directly
facing

was
the
raised
velvet
of
the
stadtholder
an
air
of
expectancy
and
gloom
lay
over
the
whole
assembly
the
white
anxious
faces
of
the
states
were
in
sharp
contrast
to
the
peaceful
scene
visible
through
the

of

round
their

wore

thrown

and

his
bright
glance
swept
the
silent
agitated
faces
turned
towards
him
he
opened

read

some
william
paused
and
again
looked
round
the
states
these
are
the
final
terms
of
france
he
said
you
have
heard
them
before
my
lords
they

abated
and
to
them
now
are
added
these
which
his
majesty
of

demands
for
the
king
of
consternation
and
anguish
showed
in
every
face
the
senators
of
rotterdam
were
weeping
some
sat
rigid
with
clasped
hands
and
fixed
eyes
others
drooped
with
hanging

bowed
by
the
bitterness
of
this
humiliation
no

my
friends
but
my
enemies
desire
for
me
this
infamous
france
and
england
have
had
my
answer
what
do
say
my
lords
he
sat
down
still
looking
at
them
grave
reserved
and
stern
the
states
remained
dumb
and
helpless
they
dare
not
decide
the
utter
bitterness
and
hopelessness
of
their
situation
robbed
them
of
their
courage
and
their
resolution
they
felt
themselves
already
slaves
they
saw
their
country
already
a
province
of
france
they
were
mute
and
in
most
eyes
the
tears
glittered
gaspard
fagel
rose
he
pressed
for
the
opinion
of
his
the
states
flung
themselves
on
the
wisdom
and
valour
of
his
highness
the
people
had
elected
him
to
be
their
captain
and
guide
most
noble
lords
answered
the
stadtholder
your
decision
is
they
joined
in
persuading
him
to
give
his
advice
they
turned
to
him
desperately
as
the
one
spark
of
hope
in
all
the
black
prospect
he
rose
again
the
sun
was
streaming
through
the
window
at
his
side
and
made
a
star
in
his
cuirass
the
little
chains
round
his
ankles
that
held
his
spurs
over
the
soft
gave
a
pleasant
clink
as
he
moved
he
held
his
left
hand
on
the
great
hilt
of
his
sword
and
his
right
on
the
scarf
across
his
breast
your
noble
mightinesses
ask
for
my
advice
i
will
say
to
you
what
i
know
you
all
have
in
your
hearts
there
is
but
one
answer
to
these
terms
the
coldest
most
contemptuous
refusal
who
but
an
abject
wretch
would
subscribe
to
such
conditions
while
he
had
breath
in
his
body
by
heaven
i
would
rather
be
torn
to
pieces
than
consent
to
any
such
humiliation
and
a
stir
ran
through
the
assembly
i
do
not
despair
continued
the
stadtholder
passionately
though
we
seem
reduced
to
desperate
extremity
yet
is
our
case
not
hopeless
if
we
make
our
answer
to
france
sword
in
to
die
honourably
is
better
than
a
miserable
it
is
not
possible
for
us
to
be
the
slaves
of
france
my
lords
you
will
reject
these
shameful
they
sat
mute
they
had
placed
their
fortunes
between
his
hands
he
was
the
master
of
their
destiny
the
destiny
of
the
united
provinces
most
of
them
were
learned
men
of
much
experience
who
had
been
long
in
office
all
of
them
were
older
than
the
man
they
looked
to
by
many
years
he
and
they
could
remember
when
he
was
a
mere
name
in
the
state
the
prisoner
of
their
noble
mightinesses
some
of
them
had
slighted
all
ignored
him
yet
now
this
young
man
s
voice
calm
decisive
above
the
tumult
and
the
anguish
swayed
them
all
they
caught
desperately
at
his
words
and
trusted
themselves
to
the
power
of
his
dominant
will
for
he
alone
stood
resolute
and
undaunted
before
such
dire
straits
as
could
cause
the
guardians
of
the
state
to
weep
aloud
he
spoke
again
if
he
had
been
schooled
to
silence
all
his
life
he
did
not
lack
expression
now
nor
a
natural
eloquence
and
passionate
force
some
of
the
fire
that
animated
him
crept
into
his
listeners
hearts
they
could
not
listen
to
him
and
still
despair
are
ye
afraid
of
war
what
greater
ills
can
it
bring
than
this
peace
that
makes
us
slaves
is
your
trust
in
god
so
little
that
ye
fear
he
will
forsake
us
this
is
not
our
downfall
but
rather
the
downfall
of
the
french
they
intoxicated
with
success
have
refused
the
concessions
we
made
them
and
now
they
shall
have
no
concessions
but
lose
all
they
ever
gained
we
have
still
enough
men
to
defend
the
frontiers
of
holland
spain
and
brandenburg
hasten
to
our
aid
break
off
these
negotiations
my
lords
they
degrade
us
and
dishearten
our
allies
shall
we
feed
the
pride
of
france
by
considering
these
high
mounting
terms
by
my
honour
there
is
nothing
i
would
not
rather
do
than
subscribe
to
such
a
peace
as
this
offered
us
sooner
would
i
be
an
exile
at
the
elector
s
court
dependent
on
his
bounty
than
be
a
king
at
the
instance
of
france
my
lords
i
have
no
fear
that
i
shall
fail
god
who
set
apart
samson
and
raised
up
gideon
to
smite
the
midianitish
host
will
strengthen
me
even
if
the
country
goes
even
if
we
lose
the
united
provinces
our
faith
is
stronger
than
our
country
and
may
survive
it
if
we
are
the
only
people
in
europe
true
to
the
pure
church
still
may
we
save
her
from
the
tyranny
and
corruption
of
the
enemy
there
is
another
land
a
wider
continent
where
we
may
worship
in
peace
and
live
unmolested
where
we
may
raise
another
amsterdam
as
rich
as
this
as
we
have
built
our
cities
here
on
land
reclaimed
from
the
sea
so
may
we
build
others
there
in
the
wilderness
my
noble
lords
in
your
ports
is
shipping
sufficient
to
carry
two
hundred
thousand
people
to
our
colonies
in
the
indian
archipelago
we
may
rear
other
churches
in
which
the
mass
will
never
be
heard
and
found
another
commonwealth
in
which
liberty
will
be
secure
even
if
we
are
driven
from
europe
in
asia
we
may
still
seek
a
refuge
this
were
better
than
submission
but
first
there
is
one
ally
to
whom
we
may
turn
for
he
paused
breathing
a
little
hurriedly
and
flung
off
his
hat
as
if
it
irked
him
his
composed
inspired
and
courageous
face
was
fully
visible
now
to
the
states
gazing
at
him
his
eyes
clear
bright
and
unflinching
as
an
eagle

took
in
the
assembly
at
a
glance
no
one
wept
now
enthusiasm
rose
high
swelled
and
gathered
they
began
to
forget
that
they
had
ever
despaired
the
weakest
was
braced
by
inward
fire
the
throb
of
pride
the
uplift
of
patriotism
and
piety
the
prince
smiled
one
ally
he
repeated
who
saved
us
once
he
loosened
his
grip
on
his
sword
and
the
gilt
steel
slipped
with
a
rattle

said

sound
like
a
muffled

from

of

to

his

in

i
ask
no
light

of
you

is
it
not
better
than

will
set
the

cried
the
burgomaster
of

the

of

many
of

are
on
low
ground
and
nothing
but
a
swift
retreat
will
save
them

do
not

of

the

the
duke
of
monmouth
and
the
king
s
brother
were
playing
tennis
in
the
green
courtyard
of
zeyst
near
them
close
to
a
wall
bright
with
coloured
roses
walked
madame
lavalette
and
the
marquis
de
pomponne
she
wore
a
habit
like
a
gentleman
s
military
coat
blue
braided
with
silver
and
a
beaver
with
a
plume
of
feathers
azure
as
her
eyes
her
long
skirt
brushed
the
grass
backwards
into
a
resemblance
to
ruffled
velvet
as
she
stepped
in
her
hands
was
a
that
she
bent
across
the
stiff
skirts
of
her
coat
marquis
she
said
monsieur
cornelius
de
witt
has
been
i
heard
last
well
she
looked
at
him
searchingly
well
he
echoed
and
smiled
you
know
the
facts
scarcely
it
is
on
michael
tichelaer
s
accusation
monsieur
de
witt
has
been
arrested
answered
the
duchess
sharply
on
the
charge
of
a
conspiracy
to
murder
the
prince
of
orange
is
it
not
the
attempt
that
failed
at
bodegraven
said
de
pomponne
well
it
does
not
touch
the
duchess
whip
made
havoc
with
van
odyk
s
roses
that
is
what
i
wondered
she
said
m
de
louvois
does
not
like
those
he
trusts
to
be
in
brief
you
fear
a
de
madame
eh
the
curling
petals
swept
on
to
the
grass
from
the
august
roses
we
failed
said
madame
lavalette
mon
dieu
yes
but
croix
is
not
alive
to
tell
tales
he
was
safely
shot
by
the
dutch
soldiers
as
he
strove
to
escape
sir
edward
seymour
told
me
he
had
hardly
cleared
the
camp
there
is
he
has
chosen
his
part
the
duchess
interrupted
impatiently
what
part
does
he
play
he
wishes
to
please
the
mob
and
ruin
the
de
witts
why
not
an
obscure
ruffian
but
he
knows
de
pomponne
shrugged
are
you
afraid
she
frowned
m
le
marquis
that
man
knows
that
we
hired
croix
to
put
the
prince
of
orange
out
of
the
she
spoke
very
low
that
it
was
de
louvois
scheme
and
that
he
tichelaer
was
to
give
out
de
witt
was
in
the
plot
so
as
to
crush
the
grand
pensionary
as
well
as
the
stadtholder
van
mander
the
fool
who
spoilt
it
all
thought
cornelius
at
least
deep
in
and
now
the
prince
escapes
st
croix
is
shot
the
design
fails
but
michael
tichelaer
persists
in
his
part
accuses
monsieur
cornelius
and
rouses
holland
against
the
de
witts
with
his
false
he
hath
a
personal
spite
against
monsieur
cornelius
that
is
why
we
selected
him
again
she
broke
in
what
if
he
says
a
little
more
if
he
declares
de
louvois
hatched
this
scheme
and
that
you
and
i
were
his
agents
he
will
you
think
so
mon
dieu
yes
we
paid
him
well
and
what
object
would
he
serve
he
poses
as
a
patriot
remember
and
finds
himself
very
popular
he
would
not
care
to
admit
he
tampered
with
us
besides
it
would
damage
his
fabrications
against
de
then
we
are
safe
from
michael
m
de
louvois
would
never
forgive
us
if
it
got
blown
abroad
he
was
at
the
bottom
of
they
walked
for
a
way
in
silence
then
the
duchess
spoke
again
and
monsieur
cornelius
de
pomponne
raised
his
eyebrows
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
not
much
hope
for
cornelius
some
such
excuse
as
this
was
only
needed
to
give
a
vent
to
the
popular
fury
against
him
and
his
brother
can
you
imagine
a
better
one
he
has
tried
to
murder
the
young
hero
of
the
moment
no
there
is
no
escape
for
de
they
will
discover
this
man
tichelaer
s
the
dutch
are
not
in
the
humour
to
be
she
fingered
her
whip
and
no
one
knows
the
truth
save
ourselves
no
she
laughed
rather
desperately
we
shall
not
speak
i
think
no
mon
dieu
sighed
the
duchess
i
recall
the
younger
de
witt
if
ever
a
man
was
a
saint
he
is
he
will
meet
with
a
saint
s
fate
i
do
not
doubt
unless
his
majesty
reaches
the
hague
in
time
to
save
him
from
the
mob
returned
the
duchess
the
king
would
be
generous
when
shall
we
be
at
the
hague
monsieur
le
marquis
in
two
three
monmouth
came
running
across
the
grass
towards
them
he
was
flushed
and
panting
he
flung
down
his
racquet
and
got
into
his
crimson
coat
did
you
see
my
lord
arlington
passed
by
but
now
such
a
face
la
something
you
frenchmen
are
too
deep
for
us
the
duke
of
orleans
plays
a
good
game
i
d
like
to
race
him
he
is
very
he
paused
and
suddenly
laughed
in
a
wholly
pleasant
conciliating
way
he
had
you
play
yourself
out
of
breath
said
madame
lavalette
speaking
in
the
soft
tone
all
women
used
to
lord
monmouth
save
me
he
cried
but
it
is
a
question
of
politics
i
swear
it
madame
i
was
not
meant
for
a
here
comes
my
lord
he
is
very
clever
marquess
but
though
he
made
a
war
nearly
as
easily
as
he
writes
verses
he
does
not
find
making
a
peace
as
easy
as
playing
the
at
this
his
idle
eye
was
caught
by
the
roses
and
the
drifting
petals
beneath
them
ah
madame
you
have
slain
the
flowers
cruel
i
would
like
to
stick
them
together
again
roses
are
rare
in
holland
madame
and
the
summer
is
nearly
he
gave
her
his
sweet
smile
and
she
answered
it
by
one
slightly
mocking
your
grace
is
very
deceptive
you
talk
like
sir
calydor
and
look
like
the
red
cross
knight
but
i
fear
you
are
but
a
worthless
rogue
after
i
vow
he
replied
i
have
been
absolved
from
all
my
i
carry
with
me
he
touched
his
breast
the
document
by
which
his
majesty
pardons
me
all
murders
committed
before
this
may
absolved
and
pardoned
see
a
fine
butterfly
could
i
scale
this
wall
with
my
hands
tied
think
you
madame
do
you
love
wrestling
ah
sure
george
is
purely
and
he
pointed
to
buckingham
coming
across
the
smooth
level
turf
towards
them
de
pomponne
went
to
meet
him
buckingham
laughed
the
terms
rejected
he
said
rejected
m
de
louvois
has
the
de
pomponne
was
surprised
in
what
manner
is
the
refusal
sent
the
most
contemptuous
possible
the
prince
deigns
no
answer
at
all
but
merely
sends
a
copy
of
the
resolution
of
the
states
by
which
the
proposals
of
peace
are
insolence
exclaimed
the
marquis
buckingham
smiled
sourly
louvois
is
furious
of
course
this
defiance
is
unlooked
he
laughed
again
he
was
fast
tiring
of
his
last
hobby
of
politics
the
dutch
war
had
lost
its
novelty
and
the
attempt
to
seduce
the
prince
of
orange
disgusted
by
reason
of
its
failure
he
was
tired
of
the
sights
of
war
and
whitehall
which
had
lately
sated
him
appeared
again
delightful
to
the
duke
s
changeful
mind
the
matter
was
more
serious
for
de
pomponne
m
de
louvois
was
furious
and
the
king
surprised
too
i
think
they
are
in
conclave
i
will
go
i
suppose
we
shall
march
on
the
hague
at
once
the
hague
repeated
buckingham
it
is
the
most
beautiful
village
in
the
world
i
hope
his
majesty
will
not
burn
it
monmouth
approached
his
racquet
in
his
hand
all
eagerness
for
the
news
peace
rejected
war
to
be
continued
the
thoughtless
soldier
is
pleased
his
quick
fancy
sees
the
green
the
roses
the
placid
sky
exchanged
again
for
the
charge
of
the
cavalry
the
attack
on
the
bastions
the
english
flags
against
the
smoke
of
the
noisy
cannon
he
sees
himself
commended
flattered
praised
by
the
great
king
complimented
by
the
great
condé
again
as
he
was
before
the
trenches
of
nymwegen
he
catches
up
his
hat
and
slips
his
arm
through
my
lord
buckingham
s
blue
velvet
sleeve
laughing
together
they
go
into
the
castle
the
marquis
and
madame
lavalette
follow
the
stands
empty
the
drift
over
the
smooth
grass
and
cling
in
the
nets
a
wind
rises
and
it
is
chilly
for
an
august
twilight
the
sun
sets
behind
the
flat
misty
horizon
in
a
dun
and
vapour
the
of
the
french
which
may
be
seen
from
the
towers
of
amsterdam
spring
up
in
the
low
meadows
other
lights
softer
more
delicate
appear
in
the
windows
of
the
castle
a
ball
is
to
be
given
in
the
great
rooms
looking
on
to
the
ramparts

sentries

watch

the
music
of
the
falling
through
the
silent
air
de
rochfort
is
expected
with
his
cavalry
regiments
has
been
expected
all
day
he
does
not
come
the
king
is
a
little
vexed
he
has
become
of
late
impatient
if
every
hour
does
not
bring
a
fresh

lord
monmouth
steps
the
minuet
as
well
as
he
wrestles
or
runs
he
dances
till
the
moon
sets
there
is
much
talk
of
the
coming
conquest
of
the
balls
to
be
held
in
the
orange
saloon
and
in
the
winter
on
the
ice
a
novelty
his
majesty
will
return
to
saint
germains
after
his
entry
into
the
hague
but
he
will
come
back
in
the
winter
for
these
new
festivities
tales
are
told
of
the
wealth
of
amsterdam
her
meanest
streets
make
the
proudest
walks
of
london
and
of
paris
appear
paltry
her
houses
are
like
palaces
buckingham
was
amazed
at
the
hague
the
width
of
the
roads
the
height
of
the
houses
the
avenues
of

the
wealthy
this
is
a
conquest
worth
the
making
so
they
dance
to
the
dawn
as
it
grows
light
monmouth
leaves
the
castle
he
has
his
quarters
at
another
château
not
far
distant
and
as
he
steps
out
on
to
the
ramparts
he
lingers
a
little
to
watch
the
dawn
my
lord
is
and
full
of
joyous
life
he
can
take
as
much
pleasure
in
watching
the
sun
rise
as
in
a
brawl
in
whitefriars
he
can
stick
a
man
through
and
never
think
of
it
again
but
he
listens
to
a
little
bird
singing
in
a
lonely
fashion
and
would
not
harm
it
for
another
dukedom
he
lingers
dallying
with
the
cool
loveliness
of
the
moment
he
sets
his
elbows
on
the
battlements
and
leans
on
the
stone
where
trail
as
beautiful
as
himself
and
he
looks
over
the
expanse
of
country
lying
beneath
him
as
the
sun
brightens
it
glimmers
in
a
curious
streak
of
silver
there
on
the
horizon
my
lord
is
a
little
puzzled
were
it
not
that
his
reason
tells
him
it
is
impossible
he
would
think
he
saw
water
saw
the
distant
line
of
the
sea
he
wraps
his
grey
mantle
round
his
brocaded
and
leaves
the
castle
saluted
by
the
silent
sentinels
he
has
missed
his
friends
a
sudden
silence
succeeds
the
gaiety
of
the
night
he
crosses
the
moat
and
enters
the
meadows
the
air
is
unaccountably
cool
he
follows
the
raised
causeway
between
the
thick
grass
crosses
a
bridge
over
a
canal
and
stops
amazed
the
meadow
before
him
is
flooded
spikes
of
grass
and
branches
of
trees
rise
from
placid
grey
water
the
river
has
overflowed
thinks
monmouth
yet
there
has
been
no
rain
he
follows
the
causeway
hastily
the
next
field
is
under
water
and
the
next
under
water
it
seems
to
him
it
rises
as
he
watches
a
clump
of
alders
high
enough
are
nearly
submerged
the
duke
stops
and
stares
about
him
the
brightening
sun
discloses
a
cottage
buried
to
the
roof
beneath
the
water
the
camp
monmouth
turns
about
quickly
the
tents
are
on
higher
ground
but
this
it
is
a
he
hesitates
daunted
and
dismayed
the
water
is
certainly
rising
now
it
is
lapping
against
the
causeway
soon
it
will
cover
it
monmouth
retraces
his
steps
turns
towards
the
camp
he
has
to
cross
a
corner
of
one
of
the
meadows
here
the
water
is
over
his
ankles
his
light
shoes
are
soaked
his
finery
wetted
bewilderment
and
terror
clutch
at
his
heart
he
quickens
his
steps
along
the
cobbled
pathway
the
canal
is
one
with
the
fields
now
a
swirling
current
hurries
against
the
trees
monmouth
stops
again
the
sun
sparkles
on
the
gleam
of
harness
a
drowned
horse
a
soldier
s
horse
is
swept
against
a
clump
of
willow
beyond
another
glitter
and
something
a
man
monmouth
bends
over
pulling
aside
the
tangled
grasses
and
leaves
he
stares
down
into
the
dead
face
of
a
french
soldier
a
soldier
in
the
brilliant
uniform
of
de
rochfort
s
regiment
with
a
little
exclamation
the
duke
drops
to
his
knees
he
reaches
his
hand
into
the
water
and
carries
it
to
his
lips
salt
his
wild
surmise
is
confirmed
he
gives
a
quick
cry
the
sea
the
sea
suddenly
the
french
trumpets
break
into
the
stillness
they
proclaim
alarm
confusion
terror
a
the
water
is
rising
covering
the
causeway
the
gleaming
cuirass
and
blue
uniform
are
tangled
in
the
alders
the
soldier
s
head
jerks
as
if
he
heard
the
my
lord
gets
to
his
feet
his
mantle
slips
back
from
his
splendid
dress
he
claps
his
hand
to
his
sword
though
no
sword
shall
avail
against
the
grass
the
weeds
the
trunks
of
the
trees
disappear
drifting
wreckage
floats
by
a
beam

at

deliverance
of

he
does
justice
too
late
to
the

he
has
always
mistrusted
he
is
reviled
hated
cursed
the
storm
has
already
engulfed
his

who
left
the

with
a
guard
of
honour
as
plenipotentiary
of
their
noble
mightinesses
returned
to
it
on
foot
a
prisoner
he
is
accused
by
one
tichelaer
a
of
a
conspiracy
to
murder
the
prince
of
orange
so
vile
is
this
man
so
weak
and
improbable
his
tale
that
at
first
john
de
witt
is
not
much
concerned
his
brother
s
innocence
he
thinks
is
too
obvious
to
him
not
to
the
people
tichelaer
s
story
is
good
enough
for
them
it
is
accepted
spread
through
the
country
with
horrid
additions
the
grand
pensionary
finds
that
all
his
influence
is
not
sufficient
to
save
his
brother
he
spares
nothing
he
toils
day
and
night
but
he
is
a
fallen
man
in
the
gevangenpoort
under
whose
dark
archway
he
has
so
often
passed
in
his
splendour
cornelius
de

lies
expecting
death
as
he
has
expected
it
since
the
day
at
dordt
when
he
resisted
the
will
of
the
people
he
is
sick
and
as
he
lies
there
in
hospital
he
cuts
with
a
little
knife
into
the
wood
of
his
bed
a
view
of
his
house
at

of
his
brother

house
and
of

ah
is
it
over
the

the
peace
the
happiness
must
disgrace
and
shame
end
a
life
that
was
so
pure
and
noble
jacob
de
witt
is
dazed
he
cares
nothing
for
the
great
events
that
tear
the
country
he
has
but
one
thing
to
say
to
his
younger
son
where
is
cornelius
why
do
they
not
set
him
free
he
can
not
understand
that
his
once
powerful
son
is
helpless
john
de
witt
desperate
tries
to
save
his
brother
by
disarming
the
resentment
of
his
enemies
he
goes
to
the
assembly
and
resigns
the
post
he
has
held
most
nobly
for
twenty
years
the
states
accept
it
they
ask
the
prince
if
they
may
thank
him
for
his
the
stadtholder
absorbed
in
the
war
sends
answer
still
he
can
not
save
cornelius
the
people
want
blood
the
elder
de
witt
is
put
to
the
torture
which
is
a
thing
beyond
credence
horrible
no
confession
is
extorted
from
him
the
unjust
judges
are
defeated
in
their
endeavours
to
please
the
mob
john
de
witt
is
distracted
by
the
agony
of
maria
de
witt
the
fears
of
his
own
children
the
piteous
bewilderment
of
his
father
the
dismay
of
his
friends
his
very
trust
in
god
is
almost
shaken
in
the
bitterness
of
his
despair
he
appeals
to
the
man
who
was
once
his
pupil
the
day
before
the
final
verdict
on
cornelius
and
his
brother
does
not
doubt
that
it
will
be
death
the
stadtholder
returns
unexpectedly
to
the
hague
such
a
tumult
of
passionate
fierce
joy
greets
him
that
for
a
moment
even
the
accusations
of
michael
tichelaer
and
the
hate
of
cornelius
de
witt
are
forgotten
he
has
come
to
ask
the
consent
of
the
states
to
the
removal
of
the
fleet
from
the
texel
he
is
received
by
the
assembly
with
more
submission
than
ever
his
uncle
obtained
from
his
parliament
they
humbly
recommend
to
him
the
necessity
of
restoring
order
in
the
country
he
reminds
them
that
all
the
troops
are
needed
on
the
frontier
he
refuses
to
employ
force
it
is
not
likely
that
he
would
turn
on
the
people
who
have
put
him
where
he
is
de
groot
has
fled
to
brussels
colonel
bampfield
and
other
republican
officers
are
dismissed
the
army
but
the
young
stadtholder
takes
no
revenge
on
his
enemies
he
even
publishes
a
proclamation
commanding
that
no
violence
be
used
against
the
members
of
the
fallen
party
this
is
denounced
as
a
forgery
by
those
who
are
resolved
to
seal
their
triumph
with
blood
john
de
witt
s
resignation
has
not
appeased
the
violence
of
his
opponents
nor
are
they
moved
by
his
modest
speech
in
the
assembly
afterwards
some
are
haunted
by
these
sentences
great
and
noble
lords
it
was
nineteen
years
ago
on
the
of
july
last
that
for
the
first
time
i
took
the
oath
in
your
assembly
in
the
capacity
of
grand
pensionary
of
the
province
of
it
has
pleased
god
in
his
anger
to
bring
down
upon
the
states
those
misfortunes
in
which
they
are
now
involved
and
that
in
a
manner
so
difficult
to
understand
that
posterity
will
find
it
hard
to
believe
what
is
most
distressing
at
this
unhappy
conjuncture
is
that
these
sudden
disasters
and
misfortunes
have
produced
in
the
minds
of
the
people
not
only
a
sentiment
of
general
fear
and
dread
but
a
sinister
feeling
against
their
unjust
as
these
suspicions
are
i
at
any
rate
am
overwhelmed
by
them
though
i
can
not
but
think
that
i
might
have
been
spared
since
as
a
humble
servant
of
the
state
i
have
only
been
bound
to
obey
implicitly
the
commands
of
my
masters
but
whether
it
is
that
i
am
thought
not
to
have
properly
carried
out
the
functions
of
my
office
or
that
ignorant
people
imagine
that
i
have
appropriated
what
never
passed
through
my
hands
i
am
so
furiously
inveighed
against
that
i
can
in
conscience
come
to
no
other
conclusion
than
that
my
services
must
henceforth
be
prejudicial
to
the
i
have
therefore
thought
it
would
be
best
to
beg
your
noble
and
great
mightinesses
as
i
very
humbly
do
that
it
may
please
your
goodness
to
relieve
me
of
the
exercise
of
my
thus
john
de
witt
speaking
for
the
last
time
in
the
assembly
a
few
days
before
the
states
informed
the
prince
that
the
perpetual
edict
had
been
torn
leaf
from
leaf
and
each
town
returned
the
signature
of
its
deputies
his
resignation
had
been
granted
with
grudging
there
had
been
talk
of
an
inquiry
first
more
than
a
hint
of
suspicion
yet
the
man
who
was
accused
of
enriching
himself
from
the
public
funds
left
after
a
lifetime
of
office
so
poor
that
he
was
forced
to
remind
the
states
of
their
promise
of
a
seat
in
the
high
court
in
order
to
have
a
livelihood
for
himself
and
his
family
and
he
had
to
endure
the
humiliation
of
this
post
being
reluctantly
given
him
for
the
six
hundred
guilders
it
was
worth
piteous
sum
as
it
was
would
be
his
principal
fortune
the
clamorous
cries
of
the
crowd
assailing
the
very
clouds
with
the
name
of
william
of
orange
came
to
his
ears
even
through
the
peace
of
his
beloved
cornelius
was
in
the
gevangenpoort
expecting
death
and
his
brother
must
see
the
prince
he
took
from
his
desk
the
letter
the
stadtholder
had
sent
him
in
answer
to
his
appeal
about
his
own
affairs
and
read
it
through
again
as
if
he
hoped
to
gain
some
knowledge
of
the
writer
s
real
feelings
towards
him
it
had
been
delayed
until
fagel
had
made
known
to
the
prince
john
de
witt
s
refusal
to
serve
under
the
new
chief
of
the
state
it
was
written
from
bodegraven
sir
i
have
received
your
letter
of
the
inst
with
the
pasquinade
that
accompanied
it
i
should
not
have
failed
to
answer
it
sooner
had
not
the
multiplicity
of
my
occupations
prevented
me
i
can
assure
you
that
i
have
always
despised
reports
which
are
started
in
this
manner
since
not
only
my
family
but
i
myself
have
been
attacked
with
a
freedom
and
avidity
beyond
all
bounds
as
to
the
two
points
of
which
you
make
mention
in
yours
namely
your
handling
of
the
secret
service
money
and
the
little
care
you
are
reported
to
have
taken
in
providing
the
army
with
all
requirements
i
can
only
say
that
as
to
the
first
i
have
no
knowledge
of
it
and
that
the
deputies
of
the
states
as
you
very
properly
observe
can
better
testify
to
this
than
any
one
else
as
to
the
second
i
do
not
and
can
not
doubt
that
you
took
such
care
of
the
armies
of
the
states
both
by
land
and
sea
as
the
conditions
of
affairs
and
of
the
times
would
allow
and
in
such
a
manner
that
they
would
have
been
capable
of
resisting
the
enemy
but
you
must
be
aware
yourself
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
specify
all
that
may
have
been
wanting
particularly
to
the
land
forces
and
to
verify
either
the
trouble
taken
to
supply
deficiencies
or
that
which
might
and
ought
to
have
been
taken
at
the
time
or
to
determine
who
was
in
fault
for
i
am
so
taken
up
with
business
that
i
have
involved
myself
as
little
as
possible
in
looking
into
the
past
you
will
therefore
find
a
much
better
justification
in
your
past
acts
of
prudence
than
in
anything
you
can
obtain
from
me
i
trust
with
all
my
heart
to
have
some
other
opportunity
of
proving
myself
your
affectionate
friend
william
henry
prince
of
john
de
witt
read
and
the
letter
it
was
cold
reserved
he
thought
well
turned
as
was
all
the
prince
indicted
as
friendly
perhaps
as
he
could
have
it
meant
possibly
that
the
prince
refused
him
all
protection
but
he
could
not
hesitate
at
scruples
of
pride
now
he
must
appeal
to
the
one
man
who
could
save
his
brother
he
took
his
hat
his
cane
and
mantle
and
left
the
house
alone
his
always
modest
establishment
was
already
reduced
to
two
servants
and
one
clerk
he
was
now
merely
a
private
citizen
and
had
neither
means
nor
occupation
for
more
calling
this
one
clerk
van
ouvenaller
to
him
before
he
left
de
witt
gave
him
a
letter
of
hope
and
comfort
for
maria
de
witt
cornelius
wife
bidding
him
see
that
it
caught
the
post
for
dordt
once
in
the
streets
he
pulled
his
hat
over
his
eyes
to
avoid
the
hostile
recognition
of
the
crowd
thronging
the
streets
to
give
a
reception
to
the
prince
who
had
just
left
the
assembly
and
was
returning
to
the
marithuis
john
de
witt
mingled
with
the
others
who
filled
the
stadtholder
s
chambers
and
waited
with
them
at
the
head
of
the
fine
double
staircase
the
sound
of
cheers
and
shouts
that
seemed
as
if
they
would
never
cease
was
borne
from
without
as
the
prince
entered
the
palace
he
came
slowly
up
the
stairs
accompanied
by
a
press
of
people
carrying
their
hats
in
their
hands
he
wore
a
suit
and
a
black
sash
a
pink
velvet
mantle
and
a
beaver
with
black
feathers
there
was
a
gold
ribbon
on
his
cane
and
gold
cords
on
his
right
shoulder
fagel
was
speaking
to
him
and
he
listened
unsmilingly
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
he
paused
and
glanced
round
the
people
gathered
to
meet
him
instantly
his
eye
fell
on
john
de
witt
and
he
blushed
violently
he
said
nothing
but
raised
his
hat
de
witt
did
the
same
and
those
about
them
were
silent
highness
said
john
de
witt
calmly
will
it
please
you
to
grant
me
speech
with
you
the
red
still
lingered
in
william
s
cheek
he
hesitated
a
slight
thing
in
most
in
him
always
so
decided
a
marked
one
fagel
fell
back
i
am
glad
to
see
you
mynheer
said
the
stadtholder
he
seemed
very
mindful
of
the
spectators
will
you
go
into
the
cabinet
perhaps
you
do
not
know
he
moved
forward
and
opened
the
door
on
his
left
john
de
witt
followed
him
the
others
even
william
bentinck
remained
without
prince
john
maurice
s
cabinet
was
a
beautiful
room
filled
with
treasures
from
the
east
indies
fine
pictures
persian
rugs
and
inlaid
furniture
the
high
window
looked
straight
on
to
the
end
of
the
vyver
and
the
walk
by
the
side
of
it
where
the
people
gathered
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
prince
it
was
late
in
the
day
and
the
sun
had
left
the
cabinet
filled
now
by
a
cold
dusky
light
the
prince
took
off
his
hat
as
john
de
witt
uncovered
they
had
not
met
since
william
s
departure
for
the
war
a
matter
of
weeks
in
time
but
a
period
full
of
great
changes
three
months
had
served
to
cast
down
john
de
witt
to
make
of
him
a
reviled
and
hated
man
and
to
exalt
william
of
orange
into
a
hero
there
was
little
of
the
boy
left
about
the
young
stadtholder
his
gravity
was
no
longer
the
disguise
of
youthful
passions
but
the
seriousness
of
manhood
he
had
put
off
his
scholar
s
air
of
retirement
and
wore
a
composed
manner
of
authority
and
alertness
you
have
changed
said
john
de
witt
looking
at
him
steadily
mynheer
i
have
been
remodelled
by
my
duties
answered
the
stadtholder
and
altered
by
the
necessity
of
the
he
stood
against
the
light
arch
of
the
window
his
profile
was
towards
john
de
witt
who
still
gazed
at
the
keen
thin
face
tanned
by
life
the
brilliant
eyes
cast
down
and
the
heavy
waving
hair
falling
on
to
the
lace
collar
we
did
not
part
lovingly
highness
but
it
was
with
more
ease
we
spoke
then
than
now
i
the
prince
looked
up
what
can
we
have
to
say
to
one
another
mynheer
john
de
witt
not
much
perhaps
but
i
think
we
meet
for
the
last
there
was
a
difference
also
in
de
witt
his
late
illness
and
his
distresses
had
left
him
wasted
lined
and
worn
his
old
stateliness
remained
but
at
times
his
voice
shook
and
broke
a
little
as
he
spoke
he
seated
himself
with
a
fatigued
air
i
can
not
frame
into
sentences
what
there
is
between
us
the
prince
spoke
suddenly
almost
fiercely
do
you
know
me
now
mynheer
do
you
see
what
manner
of
man
i
am
you
need
not
have
john
de
witt
looked
at
him
earnestly
and
sadly
i
do
admit
that
you
have
nobly
belied
what
i
once
thought
of
why
did
you
think
such
things
of
me
you
imagined
i
should
become
the
tool
of
france
a
traitor
you
always
mistrusted
and
disliked
me
why
do
you
come
to
me
now
i
think
you
wronged
he
turned
his
face
away
sharply
and
gazed
at
the
glittering
waters
of
the
vyver
glimpsing
through
the
window
john
de
witt
answered
slowly
i
was
the
fool
of
my
own
desires
the
dupe
of
my
i
dreamed
to
make
you
a
great
citizen
of
a
great
the
prince
did
not
look
round
you
chose
the
wrong
material
mynheer
you
can
not
trim
a
nassau
into
the
compass
of
burgher
i
was
at
i
did
not
allow
for
your
william
turned
now
my
ambitions
are
to
save
my
country
and
the
reformed
when
i
was
a
child
i
desired
my
i
could
never
i
was
not
schooled
in
ways
of
love
and
you
did
your
duty
to
me
as
you
conceived
it
and
taught
me
much
for
one
thing
the
bitterness
of
a
long
humiliation
and
the
lessons
that
may
be
learnt
in
loneliness
i
can
not
make
a
parade
of
gratitude
i
can
not
thank
you
i
can
not
forget
what
will
influence
all
my
life
but
i
understand
you
as
you
never
understood
me
and
so
i
can
john
de
witt
bent
his
head
i
did
what
i
thought
right
what
i
must
think
right
i
taught
you
to
be
a
patriot
and
to
fear
god
i
acted
for
the
love
of
my
country
and
for
no
vile
motive
of
my
he
looked
up
and
for
my
temerity
in
opposing
a
nassau
i
am
very
bitterly
punished
your
william
put
his
hand
on
the
back
of
the
chair
behind
him
you
could
have
stayed
in
office
if
you
would
have
served
the
states
are
my
master
and
i
resigned
while
they
were
still
my
the
stadtholder
interrupted
you
shall
be
unmolested
in
your
retirement
i
do
not
think
of
of
whom
then
my
a
shade
crossed
william
s
face
your
brother
he
repeated
john
de
witt
rose
my
brother
unjustly
accused
unjustly
tried
a
victim
to
the
fears
of
the
magistrates
the
passions
of
the
william
faced
him
i
can
not
believe
your
brother
guilty
he
said
yet
he
has
failed
to
clear
himself
on
his
trial
and
the
man
who
was
killed
at
my
feet
in
the
camp
mentioned
his
name
yet
i
do
not
believe
then
cried
de
witt
save
him
for
you
alone
can
hath
he
not
a
fair
trial
demanded
the
stadtholder
by
heaven
no
i
have
heard
very
little
of
i
have
been
so
occupied
with
the
your
highness
has
the
civil
administration
william
glanced
at
him
quickly
if
your
brother
is
innocent
will
he
not
be
acquitted
he
will
be
condemned
to
death
unless
your
highness
interferes
he
brother
on
the
word
of
a
man
whom
he
once
ordered
to
be
fined
for
beating
his
the
stadtholder
did
not
answer
john
de
witt
spoke
again
his
cheek
pale
but
his
eyes
burning
my
noble
lord
if
you
ever
hated
me
you
are
avenged
i
would
never
have
wished
you
a
tenth
of
what
has
befallen
me
you
have
your
father
s
dignities
the
people
have
placed
you
where
he
sat
and
my
republic
is
swept
aside
is
a
mere
interlude
in
the
reign
of
the
house
of
orange
if
ever
you
wished
me
evil
consider
that
i
see
my
come
to
nothing
that
i
hear
myself
cursed
by
the
people
i
have
toiled
for
that
i
am
accused
of
being
a
thief
and
a
traitor
and
be
satisfied
if
ever
i
have
humiliated
you
or
angered
you
and
never
did
i
so
wantonly
consider
that
i
have
had
to
ask
the
states
to
give
me
a
position
that
will
bring
me
bread
consider
that
my
family
is
ruined
that
i
leave
nothing
but
a
heritage
of
failure
to
my
sons
and
again
be
satisfied
i
shall
not
trouble
you
i
am
not
made
for
intrigue
had
i
been
i
need
not
have
stood
before
you
now
asking
for
my
brother
s
after
my
great
labour
i
shall
be
content
to
take
a
little
idleness
in
which
to
prepare
me
for
i
shall
not
trouble
you
give
me
my
brother
s
he
is
an
innocent
man
you
who
have
looked
on
him
must
know
he
is
a
man
who
has
given
all
to
his
country
he
has
been
great
and
they
tortured
oh
god
forgive
your
highness
if
you
knew
of
that
the
prince
moved
towards
the
window
i
only
heard
john
de
witt
put
his
hand
over
his
hot
and
aching
eyes
he
is
also
sufficiently
punished
for
having
withstood
your
i
ask
nay
i
demand
his
william
turned
he
too
was
pale
were
he
guilty
mynheer
he
should
not
die
by
virtue
of
your
honourable
i
blame
myself
that
i
did
not
sooner
interpose
and
greatly
am
i
ashamed
that
he
was
put
to
the
but
the
mob
rules
here
not
i
have
a
task
so
manifold
before
me
that
i
might
well
despair
the
country
under
water
the
peasants
rising
the
enemy
but
just
repulsed
the
towns
in
a
state
of
my
amnesty
is
scarcely
yet
i
will
save
cornelius
de
i
do
not
need
to
thank
your
highness
for
you
would
injure
your
own
honour
should
you
have
william
coughed
i
will
do
what
i
can
at
least
they
shall
not
take
his
but
if
they
banish
him
you
must
not
blame
i
know
there
is
an
astonishing
fury
against
banishment
i
have
lived
here
twenty
years
but
all
now
has
changed
with
cornelius
i
will
gladly
go
into
banishment
if
it
must
the
stadtholder
s
large
eyes
rested
on
him
gravely
mynheer
as
i
can
judge
the
temper
of
the
people
you
are
scarcely
safe
at
the
hague
i
would
advise
you
leave
it
soon
you
and
cornelius
de
my
noble
lord
said
john
de
witt
proudly
you
know
me
guiltless
of
these
charges
laid
to
me
my
letter
told
you
it
was
not
warm
in
my
the
stadtholder
answered
straightly
i
think
you
made
mistakes
i
told
you
so
when
our
positions
were
reversed
i
think
the
defences
of
the
country
shamefully
neglected
your
peace
policy
fatal
your
embassy
to
louis
calculated
to
give
colour
to
vile
reports
but
i
know
you
mynheer
for
an
honourable
john
de
witt
very
slightly
smiled
i
thank
your
noble
highness
for
so
much
he
said
william
coloured
in
response
to
the
tone
of
it
have
you
ever
held
such
worthy
opinions
of
me
he
asked
that
i
should
bear
warm
testimony
to
your
virtues
your
policy
is
not
my
you
have
saved
holland
with
you
rests
the
glory
of
her
deliverance
as
with
me
the
odium
of
her
fall
but
i
would
no
less
have
saved
her
had
hatred
given
me
time
to
speak
or
malice
allowed
me
space
to
act
i
still
highness
defend
my
he
rested
his
eyes
full
on
the
prince
s
face
but
william
kept
his
eyes
averted
i
would
do
justice
to
you
mynheer
had
i
known
you
in
any
capacity
save
that
of
gaoler
i
might
have
loved
i
always
hated
speech
and
am
not
skilled
at
if
i
have
been
ungracious
let
circumstances
be
my
john
de
witt
answered
ardently
if
you
love
your
country
i
will
forgive
you
that
you
hate
me
nay
if
my
fall
be
of
advantage
to
the
state
in
raising
up
a
stronger
protector
one
that
the
people
trust
and
love
i
am
thankful
for
they
trusted
me
once
and
shouted
for
cornelius
when
we
rode
our
galiots
in
the
beware
of
popularity
my
noble
william
pressed
his
handkerchief
to
his
lips
still
looking
away
do
not
fear
that
i
will
not
serve
my
country
i
bear
an
unfinished
motto
when
i
was
a
boy
i
completed
it
proudly
i
will
maintain
the
power
and
glory
of
the
house
of
orange
now
i
would
add
liberty
and
the
protestant
religion
to
those
words
of
john
de
witt
was
silent
a
moment
then
he
said
slowly
i
grieve
the
chance
that
makes
us
enemies
for
we
should
have
shown
well
as
friends
my
the
prince
turned
and
fixed
at
last
his
bright
glance
again
on
de
witt
mynheer
when
king
mithridates
eupator
came
to
the
throne
he
sent
a
message
to
his
enemies
telling
them
of
his
no
more
was
needed
they
understood
and
destroyed
so
between
us
you
will
not
serve
me
and
i
need
not
tell
you
you
must
leave
the
hague
mynheer
and
when
my
brother
is
set
at
liberty
your
that
shall
be
you
are
staying
here
i
quit
early
for
woerden
mynheer
to
inspect
the
fortifications
of
the
then
will
you
leave
some
soldiery
behind
your
highness
for
i
have
a
fear
of
the
unchecked
violence
of
the
mob
the
gevangenpoort
hath
been
twice
attacked
and
i
think
my
brother
s
life
in
count
tilly
s
dragoons
shall
remain
to
keep
order
in
the
i
thank
your
mechanically
john
de
witt
fastened
together
the
clasps
of
his
black
velvet
mantle
the
prince
still
stood
his
aristocratic
figure
in
the
dove
grey
in
keeping
with
the
rich
quiet
and
sombre
room
they
were
looking
at
each
other
and
there
was
more
in
the
eyes
of
each
than
any
words
could
have
touched
de
witt
moved
slowly
towards
the
door
i
can
not
leave
you
he
said
in
a
low
voice
and
with
a
simple
air
of
grandeur
you
who
have
been
my
pupil
i
can
not
leave
you
for
ever
without
saying
how
i
shall
ever
pray
for
your
prosperity
and
that
though
you
can
not
be
more
zealous
you
may
be
more
fortunate
than
i
have
been
in
serving
our
country
you
have
begun
very
nobly
may
god
keep
you
faithful
to
your
ideals
guard
you
from
your
enemies
and
make
you
worthy
of
the
trust
reposed
in
you
by
this
unhappy
land
my
william
made
a
half
movement
towards
him
m
de
witt
he
said
in
a
stifled
voice
m
de
witt
the
fallen
minister
smiled
almost
tenderly
you
have
a
hard

william
held
out
his
hand
forget
i
am
nassau
and
take
my
hand
as
that
of
one
who
should
be
grateful
to
john
de
witt
responded
instantly
the
fine
fingers
clasped
it
seemed
as
if
both
men
must
speak
but
no
word
passed
mynheer
the
prince
said
at
last
your
john
de
witt
passed
through
the
crowded
antechamber
and
out
into
the
street
for
the
first
time
in
twenty
years
he
found
himself
without
the
cares
of
government
without
the
routine
of
pressing
business
to
attend
to
his
body
obeyed
the
new
condition
of
his
mind
he
found
himself
wandering
with
no
set
purpose
a
thing
he
had
not
done
since
his
student
days
in
dordt
he
realised
as
he
went
on
his
way
that
it
was
pleasant
to
walk
aimlessly
in
the
last
glow
of
an
august
sun
perhaps
he
was
a
little
stunned
weakened
by
illness
and
misfortune
his
thoughts
travelled
back
to
early
hopes
and
interests
he
was
a
free
man
at
last
at
last
he
could
find
at
last
he
and
cornelius
and
their
old
father
could
live
peaceably
in
the
spanish
netherlands
he
would
grow
peaches
and
tulips
translate
horace
and
watch
his
daughters
spin
or
play
the
guitar
it
would
be
harder
for
cornelius
for
he
was
ever
a
man
of
action
but
for
himself
he
could
not
deny
that
he
was
utterly
weary
and
that
repose
seemed
sweet
leaving
the
crowded
streets
he
walked
along
the
side
of
the
canal
that
led
to
the
nieuwe
kerk
he
sighed
with
a
pleasurable
sense
of
the
peace
to
come
as
he
watched
the
slow
barges
pass
down
the
bright
water
some
were
laden
with
flowers
and
fruits
from
the
tall
trees
came
soft
scents
and
delicate
sounds
of
the
branches
john
de
witt
sighed
again
a
stork
with
a
fish
in
its
beak
looking
like
the
very
arms
of
the
hague
stood
on
the
bank
a
moment
then
flew
off
to
one
of
the
red
roofs
mounting
like
double
steps
to
the
highest
stone
of
painted
brick
the
sun
was
setting
behind
ryswyck
the
sight
of
the
clear
sky
purged
with
celestial
fire
from
all
vapours
and
clouds
animated
the
heart
of
john
de
witt
like
prayer
or
music
he
bared
his
head
it
was
quiet
here
no
one
to
molest
or
insult
the
melancholy
divine
dignity
of
evening
he
crossed
the
little
bridge
before
the
church
walking
lightly
like
one
who
does
not
think
of
the
earth
on
which
he
treads
it
was
over
his
done
nor
was
he
afraid
of
god
s
judgment
on
his
actions
though
man
had
condemned
them
all
he
advanced
to
the
church
thinking
to
pray
there
for
his
mood
was
exalted
as
he
opened
the
door
a
paper
pinned
to
it
caught
his
eye
it
bore
bold
writing
and
he
stepped
back
to
read
the
light
of
the
sunset
was
still
bright
enough
for
him
to
see
lucifer
calls
from
hell
when
is
cornelius
de
witt
coming
i
grow
impatient
let
him
come
at
once
let
him
bring
his
brother
but
leave
his
head
lucifer
calls
from
hell
when
are
the
de
witts
coming
the
burghers
call
from
the
hague
expect
them
john
de
witt
stood
on
the
church
step
staring
at
the
paper
the
rapture
died
from
his
face
his
eyes
widened
and
his
cheek
paled
rapidly
the
sunset
faded
another
barge
went
by
a
shadow
in
the
dusk
it
brought
no
image
of
peace
now
to
the
man
at
the
door
of
the
church
what
is
brewing
what
is
enmeshing
us
he
did
not
enter
the
church
but
turned
back
to
his
own
house
slowly
lucifer
calls
from
hell
when
are
the
de
witts
coming
the
burghers
call
from
the
hague
expect
them
chapter
xii
august
he
was
still
dressing
when
johanna
de
zwyndrecht
came
to
him
the
gaoler
s
maid
from
the
gevangenpoort
john
she
could
say
no
more
from
cornelius
he
had
just
finished
shaving
and
stood
with
his
collar
untied
and
the
strings
in
his
hand
ah
he
sends
for
me
john
de
witt
stepped
up
to
her
and
put
his
arm
about
her
johanna
my
dear
has
he
been
sentenced
to
banishment
the
councillors
the
maid
says
read
him
his
sentence
in
the
prison
this
she
dropped
her
head
on
his
shoulder
and
a
sob
broke
from
her
full
heart
oh
john
my
dear
my
dear
he
has
his
life
and
his
liberty
i
will
go
fetch
him
from
the
prison

his
sister
shuddered
yes
and
yet
what
ah
they
have
been
rioting
all
night
i
wish
we
were
away
from
the
hague
we
shall
be
he
drew
her
gently
downstairs
there
his
daughter
anna
waited
in
the
it
was
not
yet
nine
and
the
early
sun
had
not
touched
the
cool
chamber
the
gaoler
s
maid
had
gone
again
simply
leaving
this
message
that
de
witt
was
to
be
set
at
liberty
and
had
on
hearing
this
at
once
requested
that
his
brother
might
be
sent
for
i
will
go
repeated
john
de
witt
at
once
and
bring
him
his
daughter
who
held
her
hands
clenched
and
pressed
upon
her
heart
looked
at
him
with
a
wild
expression
father
must
you
go
can
not
uncle
cornelius
be
brought
here
you
go
anna
do
you
know
what
the
streets
are
like
the
maid
said
every
one
was
furious
because
my
uncle
was
not
condemned
to
she
rose
and
her
pale
eyes
brimmed
with
tears
do
not
go
cornelius
sent
for
he
did
not
understand
dearest
the
hague
is
safe
enough
no
no
there
are
the
burgher
companies
they
are
he
was
not
to
be
persuaded
cornelius
sent
for
johanna
also
was
fearful
you
will
at
least
not
go
alone
she
said
i
will
take
the
clerk
and
van
den
wissel
if
it
please
yes
i
will
tell
anna
was
not
to
be
comforted
what
she
had
seen
and
heard
these
last
weeks
at
the
hague
had
utterly
unnerved
her
she
clung
to
her
father
convulsively
dumb
with
the
swelling
sobs
agneta
sat
in
the
wide
her
head
bowed
on
to
her
knees
van
ouvenaller
who
had
been
abroad
that
morning
had
repeated
to
her
in
his
agitation
some
of
the
remarks
he
had
heard
in
the
streets
michael
tichelaer
he
declared
is
running
up
and
down
telling
every
man
he
meets
that
cornelius
is
as
good
as
acquitted
and
that
he
must
by
no
means
escape
his
the
presage
of
unimaginable
evil
conveyed
in
this
held
agneta
speechless
her
spirit
was
so
chained
with
terror
that
she
could
not
even
join
anna
in
her
vain
entreaties
john
de
witt
strove
to
quiet
and
console
them
all
by
speaking
of
homely
things
he
desired
his
sister
to
prepare
a
meal
for
cornelius
who
would
have
had
but
a
prison
breakfast
and
to
lay
out
some
garments
for
him
for
he
intended
to
take
his
brother
at
once
to
his
where
maria
his
wife
and
her
children
stayed
jacob
de
witt
he
knew
would
wish
to
accompany
him
but
the
old
man
was
sitting
happily
in
the
garden
with
his
little
grandson
john
who
had
rushed
to
tell
him
that
cornelius
was
safe
and
he
would
not
trouble
him
so
commanded
them
not
to
let
him
know
of
his
departure
not
waiting
for
the
coach
he
bid
the
man
bring
it
round
to
the
gevangenpoort
in
half
an
hour
s
time
the
prison
was
but
a
few
yards
away
as
he
gave
this
order
the
women
were
silent
and
averted
their
eyes
from
one
another
they
knew
it
meant
that
cornelius
would
not
be
able
to
walk
or
perhaps
even
to
stand
the
day
before
he
had
been
tortured
by
the
rack
the
pulley
and
the
cord
johanna
felt
as
if
the
screws
were
turned
on
her
own
heart
as
the
hideous
image
of
her
brother
in
agony
flashed
before
her
she
turned
aside
with
gulping
tears
at
about
nine
john
de
witt
gently
left
their
sorrowful
company
and
set
out
on
foot
for
the
gevangenpoort
he
had
with
him
the
two
clerks
bacherus
and
ouvenaller
and
his
faithful
servant
van
den
wissel
who
had
nearly
been
slain
in
van
der
graef
s
attack
on
his
master
it
was
a
warm
lovely
morning
little
flakes
of
gold
lay
in
the
ripples
of
the
vyver
and
there
was
a
shimmering
of
light
and
shade
in
the
chestnuts
and
elms
john
de
witt
noticed
nothing
warranted
to
rouse
the
fears
his
sister
and
daughters
entertained
there
were
the
women
going
to
market
the
farmers
drawn
by
their
dogs
in
their
little
painted
carts
the
usual
one
saluted
him
for
the
rest
he
was
unnoticed
he
passed
the
spot
where
john
van
olden
barnenveldt
had
been
executed
and
thought
of
it
as
he
had
continually
done
of
late
when
he
crossed
the
plaats
many
times
had
he
looked
at
the
old
gate
prison
now
with
a
horrid
interest
and
a
painful
shrinking
the
plain
brick
building
with
its
high
tiled
roof
pierced
with
two
gabled
windows
built
over
the
low
dark
arch
above
which
the
arms
of
holland
were
set
had
always
been
a
place
of
awe
to
him
because
it
had
witnessed
the
imprisonment
and
agonies
of
those
early
reformers
who
had
been
martyred
by
the
inquisition
but
now
its
association
made
him
quiver
to
his
heart
cornelius
had
been
tortured
here
yesterday
de
witt
went
very
pale
as
he
traversed
the
passage
of
the
arch
at
the
door
of
the
on
the
right
a
small
mean
entrance
were
two
soldiers
of
the
burgher
guard
they
had
been
placed
there
ever
since
the
attempt
of
the
mob
to
carry
forth
cornelius
de
witt
john
de
witt
set
his
lips
the
moment
cost
him
something
van
ouvenaller
rang
the
heavy
iron
bell
the
gaoler
opened
to
them
and
almost
immediately
which
way
asked
de
witt
the
gaoler
stared
come
said
van
ouvenaller
you
know
john
de
the
man
pulled
off
his
cap
at
that
and
de
witt
followed
him
across
the
narrow
threshold
and
up
a
narrow
stairway
worn
old
and
dark
that
wound
up
to
a
long
dark
corridor
lit
by
small
windows
giving
on
the
inner
courtyard
opposite
one
of
these
windows
the
gaoler
stopped
slipped
back
the
bolts
from
a
low
heavy
wooden
door
and
stood
aside
for
de
witt
to
enter
he
stepped
into
a
room
with
a
ceiling
plaster
walls
a
brick
fireplace
and
one
window
overlooking
the
plaats
and
barred
lengthwise
and
across
with
iron
there
were
a
few
chairs
a
handsome
carved
table
and
opposite
the
fireplace
and
sideways
to
the
window
a
simple
wooden
bed
on
which
lay
cornelius
in
his
nightgown
a
red
coverlet
over
him
near
him
stood
a
second
smaller
table
on
which
were
a
few
books
and
a
shining
brass
candlestick
seeing
the
door
open
cornelius
raised
himself
on
his
elbow
expectantly
john
de
witt
crossed
the
room
the
clerks
servant
and
the
gaoler
behind
him
when
the
brothers
had
parted
four
months
ago
one
had
been
the
governor
of
his
country
at
home
the
other
the
guardian
of
her
honour
at
sea
they
had
been
treated
with
deference
surrounded
with
respect
the
greatest
men
in
the
land
four
months
ago
they
were
both
stately
and
of
austere
manners
both
mindful
that
they
were
not
alone
how
are
you
brother
asked
john
advancing
to
the
bedside
i
have
not
seen
you
since
your
return
from
the
cornelius
was
equally
resolved
not
to
show
the
feeling
that
was
too
deep
indeed
for
expression
nor
i
you
since
your
wounds
and
illness
he
answered
he
fell
back
again
on
his
hard
pillow
john
glanced
at
his
bandaged
hands
at
his
grey
and
drawn
face
and
the
colour
rushed
into
his
own
and
ebbed
again
i
am
come
to
take
you
away
cornelius
he
said
faintly
the
ruard
s
brown
eyes
flashed
with
their
old
fire
not
yet
i
do
not
submit
to
my
john
seated
himself
on
the
chair
beside
the
bed
what
was
the
crime
your
sentence
accused
you
of
none
that
is
my
point
by
a
flagrant
breach
of
the
law
the
sentence
made
no
accusation
but
merely
condemned
me
to
it
was
read
to
you
here
yes
though
i
claimed
it
should
be
delivered
at
the
bar
of
the
court
it
was
for
fear
of
the
riots
they
john
looked
at
him
in
a
troubled
earnest
way
forgive
me
said
cornelius
breathing
heavily
with
pain
i
was
under
torture
for
two
hours
yesterday
and
as
my
rheumatism
made
me
sensitive
it
has
left
me
i
can
not
explain
it
all
to
you
as
i
should
john
wiped
his
brow
and
then
clenched
his
handkerchief
in
his
hand
i
must
get
you
away
you
are
at
least
free
no
i
will
appeal
to
the
grand
council
against
this
unlawful
i
dare
not
consent
to
any
delay
in
your
cornelius
answered
proudly
shall
i
leave
this
prison
a
condemned
criminal
when
i
am
innocent
alas
i
fear
you
will
never
obtain
justice
only
through
my
personal
appeal
to
the
prince
have
the
people
been
disappointed
of
your
the
prince
repeated
cornelius
fiercely
i
do
not
wish
the
pity
of
the
prince
but
the
justice
of
the
that
is
said
john
what
you
will
never
obtain
in
these
wild
and
passionate
what
we
shall
neither
of
us
obtain
under
william
of
orange
replied
cornelius
the
gaoler
had
left
them
yet
even
before
the
two
clerks
the
remark
was
rash
the
stadtholder
said
john
de
witt
did
what
he
could
he
warned
me
to
leave
the
hague
but
cornelius
was
ever
the
more
fiery
and
unyielding
of
the
two
he
had
a
warlike
pride
not
easily
subdued
with
the
same
unshaken
firmness
with
which
he
had
endured
the
rack
he
protested
that
he
would
appeal
to
the
grand
council
his
brother
represented
that
it
would
be
in
vain
as
the
decision
of
the
court
was
held
to
be
final
i
wonder
said
cornelius
that
you
try
to
persuade
me
against
my
honour
why
should
i
submit
to
tyranny
he
looked
at
his
hands
through
the
linen
bandages
of
which
the
blood
was
oozing
have
i
not
borne
enough
he
demanded
proudly
john
de
witt
rose
in
agitation
i
think
of
your
safety
let
us
get
out
of
the
hague
not
banished
and
dishonoured
said
cornelius
firmly
and
ruined
too
they
have
taken
all
my
offices
and
dignities
from
me
and
ordered
me
to
pay
the
costs
of
the
trial
shall
i
go
to
my
children
a
useless
degraded
man
ah
cornelius
but
you
cherish
a
vain
dream
when
you
imagine
that
the
grand
council
can
or
will
do
you
justice
i
wish
to
save
your
life
for
that
is
all
that
we
can
see
my
sentence
answered
cornelius
eagerly
it
is
so
full
of
flaws
of
breaches
of
the
law
that
they
would
not
dare
to
refuse
my
john
saw
his
brother
was
resolved
that
he
must
at
least
humour
him
i
will
see
the
sentence
he
said
go
to
the
record
office
and
fetch
me
here
a
copy
of
my
brother
s
the
clerk
left
the
room
john
de
witt
went
back
to
the
bedside
i
am
in
anguish
till
i
see
you
out
of
this
he
said
i
will
cornelius
the
coach
waits
below
to
take
you
home
am
i
not
a
banished
outcast
man
there
are
maria
and
your
cornelius
was
silent
you
think
i
give
cowardly
counsels
said
his
brother
but
i
am
but
too
well
convinced
that
we
need
hope
for
nothing
more
in
he
turned
away
abruptly
to
hide
his
agitation
and
crossed
to
the
window
little
groups
of
people
were
gathered
on
the
plaats
mostly
looking
towards
the
prison
the
groote
kerk
struck
ten
john
walked
up
and
down
the
rough
boards
looking
on
the
ground
cornelius
watched
him
with
dark
and
resolute
eyes
both
were
very
pale
what
of
maria
asked
cornelius
at
length
very
low
she
has
written
to
you
every
day
but
was
always
so
eager
to
hearten
me
poor
soul
that
i
know
not
much
of

well
she
hath
kept
up
a
wonderful
she
is
coming
to
the
hague
to
be
the
first
to
greet
you
on
your
again
cornelius
was
silent
then
he
said
she
will
hardly
know
john
could
not
answer
the
ruard
spoke
again
john
i
am
innocent
of
even
the
shadow
of
what
is
imputed
to
this
to
me
cried
his
brother
reproachfully
a
man
might
well
get
bemused
with
all
their
lies
said
cornelius
wearily
silence
again
an
unaccountable
uneasiness
possessed
john
de
witt
he
longed
to
see
his
brother
at
his
side
in
his
coach
the
open
country
before
them
the
hague
behind
bacherus
is
very
he
broke
the
pause
at
last
the
record
office
was
only
a
few
moments
walk
distant
john
looked
from
the
window
again
the
crowd
had
increased
van
ouvenaller
he
said
go
and
see
what
hath
become
of
the
second
clerk
left
the
window
commanded
a
view
of
the
plaats
the
vyver
and
the
kneuterdyk
avenue
with
john
de
witt
s
house
at
the
corner
and
the
window
in
the
narrow
corridor
looked
on
to
the
court
enclosed
by
the
prison
building
but
they
were
without
any
means
of
discovering
what
was
happening
in
the
buitenhof
opposite
the
prison
door
in
a
few
moments
ouvenaller
returned
pallid
and
trembling
ah
mynheer
he
exclaimed
there
is
an
angry
crowd
gathered
they
have
sent
away
your
carriage
and
i
fear
that
bacherus
will
not
be
able
to
what
is
this
cried
cornelius
starting
up
john
you
must
go
at
once
i
should
never
have
sent
for
you
what
do
they
say
asked
the
younger
de
witt
they
say
that
they
will
not
have
mynheer
cornelius
leave
in
triumph
but
that
he
must
go
on
is
tichelaer
there
yes
among
the
ringleaders
calling
horrid
names
on
you
both
mynheeren
john
said
cornelius
firmly
you
must
leave
me
while
you
yes
answered
his
brother
catching
up
his
mantle
i
will
leave
you
because
i
will
go
to
the
states
and
complain
of
these
disturbances
but
i
shall
return
very
shortly
to
liberate
i
trust
to
your
advice
answered
cornelius
i
will
go
with
you
on
your
return
if
you
think
it
fit
for
a
little
putting
on
his
hat
and
accompanied
by
van
ouvenaller
and
his
servant
john
de
witt
descended
to
the
mean
passage
from
which
the
insignificant
door
gave
straight
on
to
the
street
the
gaoler
van
bossi
opened
it
for
his
exit
but
as
de
witt
made
to
step
out
of
the
prison
the
two
burghers
on
guard
crossed
their
muskets
before
him
no
one
can
leave
one
of
them
said
and
roughly
motioned
him
back
john
de
witt
surveyed
him
sternly
why
not
he
demanded
you
know
very
well
who
i
others
of
the
burgher
company
came
running
up
to
where
de
witt
stood
in
the
narrow
doorway
behind
the
crossed
muskets
you
can
not
leave
without
an
order
a
soldier
shouted
whose
order
do
you
require
asked
john
de
witt
that
of
our
the
crowd
began
hurrying
up
from
all
quarters
seeing
who
stood
in
the
doorway
they
raised
a
shout
of
fire
fire
a
musket
was
discharged
john
de
witt
coloured
with
anger
and
was
in
the
act
of
forcing
his
way
out
regardless
of
the
threatening
yells
when
the
gaoler
thrust
him
violently
back
and
quickly
closed
the
door
john
de
witt
had
been
handled
with
such
force
that
he
stumbled
and
fell
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
as
he
rose
again
he
lifted
the
long
disordered
hair
from
his
face
on
which
was
an
expression
of
horror
as
if
he
had
seen
an
image
of
hideous
death
i
wish
i
were
out
of
this
he
muttered
how
can
i
get
out
of
this
the
gaoler
stood
dumb
and
terrified
quickly
john
de
witt
composed
himself
take
me
back
to
my
brother
he
said
he
had
not
ascended
half
the
stairs
before
the
bell
of
the
prison
rang
two
burgher
captains
stood
without
van
os
a
postman
and
van
asselyn
a
bookseller
john
de
witt
was
called
down
to
speak
to
them
they
were
moved
by
his
composed
serene
demeanour
and
promised
to
persuade
the
captain
of
the
guard
to
let
him
pass
he
waited
for
their
return
but
in
vain
the
other
burghers
prevented
it
i
wish
i
were
out
of
this
repeated
de
witt
how
shall
i
get
out
is
there
no
other
way
but
this
no
no
other
exit
at
all
none
whatever
mynheer
admitted
the
frightened
gaoler
john
de
witt
bit
his
lower
lip
very
well
i
am
going
back
to
my
brother
he
said
he
had
already
been
in
the
prison
nearly
two
hours
as
he
mounted
the
stairs
he
could
hear
clearly
enough
the
shouts
and
cries
of
the
mob
johanna
s
fears
and
the
tears
of
anna
the
placard
of
last
night
were
all
very
clear
in
his
mind
he
shuddered
despite
himself
there
was
an
atmosphere
about
the
dull
confined
spaces
of
the
prison
sufficient
in
itself
to
depress
the
heart
and
check
the
delusions
of
hope
the
gaoler
alarmed
by
the
turn
things
were
taking
confided
to
de
witt
that
michael
tichelaer
before
his
release
that
morning
he
had
been
in
prison
during
the
trial
of
cornelius
had
uttered
the
most
horrid
threats
against
the
brothers
so
that
he
van
bossi
had
sent
to
ask
the
judges
to
keep
him
in
the
prison
until
the
ruard
was
in
safety
but
the
judges
had
ordered
tichelaer
to
be
released
declaring
that
they
would
see
that
order
was
preserved
but
all
the
morning
tichelaer
had
been
going
up
and
down
the
hague
inflaming
the
people
by
saying
they
were
like
to
lose
their
victim
through
the
foolish
clemency
of
his
highness
van
bossi
added
that
he
would
send
his
servant
to
the
states
who
were
now
sitting
asking
them
to
dispatch
a
force
to
hold
the
people
in
check
is
the
stadtholder
still
at
the
hague
asked
de
witt
mynheer
he
left
for
woerden
at
eight
this
john
de
witt
entered
in
silence
his
brother
s
room
leaving
his
clerk
and
servant
below
he
found
cornelius
reading
a
little
elzevir
horace
which
he
held
awkwardly
in
his
bandaged
hands
john
returned
they
were
alone
now
unwatched
their
one
care
to
conceal
their
uneasiness
from
each
other
i
can
not
leave
the
prison
said
john
seating
himself
beside
the
bed
the
streets
are
too
disordered
trapped
muttered
cornelius
trapped
that
rogue
tichelaer
means
my
the
gaoler
has
sent
his
servant
to
the
states
answered
his
brother
quickly
to
demand
protection
for
the
ah
it
is
as
serious
as
that
cornelius
laid
down
the
horace
i
wish
i
could
stand
he
said
through
his
teeth
john
turned
his
eyes
away
i
should
never
have
sent
for
you
continued
his
brother
reproaching
himself
i
am
safe
enough
the
prince
left
count
tilly
behind
a
sudden
roar
from
the
plaats
broke
off
his
speech
tilly
s
dragoons
cried
cornelius
who
heard
horsemen
john
was
at
the
window
no
the
burgher
not
the
forces
of
the
states
but
the
soldiers
of
the
people
were
arriving
at
the
plaats
perhaps
fifteen
hundred
of
them
already
surrounding
the
prison
the
company
of
the
blue
stationed
itself
by
the
vyver
four
other
companies
marched
out
of
sight
while
the
division
of
the
white
orange
and
blue
took
up
their
position
in
front
of
the
gevangenpoort
john
de
witt
could
see
them
exchange
pleasantries
with
the
crowd
while
many
among
them
echoed
the
popular
cry
up
with
orange
down
with
de
witt
heaven
guard
us
he
muttered
if
we
must
trust
to
these
van
bossi
returned
the
message
had
he
said
been
taken
to
the
states
who
had
ordered
out
the
cavalry
and
dispatched
a
messenger
to
the
prince
of
orange
as
he
was
the
only
man
they
declared
who
could
restore
order
in
the
hague
have
the
magistrates
no
power
asked
cornelius
scornfully
very
little
it
seemed
since
the
arming
of
the
burgher
companies
they
trembled
for
their
own
lives
how
far
is
the
prince
s
camp
asked
john
de
witt
eight
leagues
they
the
gaoler
added
that
the
hague
was
in
a
hideous
state
of
ferment
and
passion
and
that
the
states
feared
a
general
riot
in
which
every
one
of
republican
sympathies
would
be
massacred
john
de
witt
rose
with
an
uncontrollable
sound
of
anguish
for
he
thought
of
his
family
separated
from
him
by
only
a
few
yards
yet
at
the
mercy
of
the
mob
o
god
my
god
he
cried
spare
me
that
at
least
cornelius
struggled
into
a
sitting
position
van
bossi
he
said
firmly
desire
some
of
these
burghers
to
come
and
speak
with
john
turned
eagerly
yes
bring
these
men
before
us
let
them
state
their
grievances
to
our
mynheeren
i
dare
not
bring
any
of
them
into
the
we
are
not
afraid
said
cornelius
calmly
van
bossi
looked
from
one
to
the
other
i
wish
you
both
out
of
this
mynheeren
he
declared
has
any
one
been
to
the
states
cried
john
de
witt
walking
up
and
down
if
they
would
let
me
out
that
i
might
speak
to
the
states
he
could
not
believe
that
the
assembly
he
had
swayed
for
twenty
years
would
be
deaf
to
him
have
a
little
patience
mynheer
answered
van
bossi
and
i
will
speak
to
van
ruysch
the
colonel
of
the
burghers
who
is
outside
the
we
thank
you
said
cornelius
and
my
friend
since
my
brother
is
like
to
be
detained
here
will
you
send
us
some
food
the
man
stared
at
him
confounded
at
his
calm
it
is
past
midday
said
john
bring
us
what
you
the
gaoler
left
in
silence
cornelius
took
up
a
book
with
an
air
of
unconcern
it
was
a
volume
of
french
plays
but
he
did
not
look
at
the
pages
his
eyes
could
not
leave
his
brother
who
was
standing
by
the
barred
window
gazing
out
on
to
the
plaats
what
are
they
doing
asked
cornelius
after
a
while
gathering
in
great
numbers
armed
all
armed
answered
john
there
comes
tilly
and
his
he
could
not
repress
a
little
sigh
of
relief
as
the
guards
three
hundred
strong
swept
through
the
crowd
and
took
up
their
position
before
the
prison
a
cry
of
long
live
his
highness
broke
from
the
people
and
down
with
the
de
witts
we
are
of
the
same
opinion
some
of
the
soldiery
shouted
back
they
too
are
disaffected
muttered
john
but
count
tilly
is
a
brave
and
loyal
officer
said
cornelius
each
was
very
careful
not
to
show
the
slightest
sign
of
inward
uneasiness
they
did
not
dare
speak
on
intimate
subjects
for
fear
they
should
betray
themselves
john
left
the
window
and
came
back
to
the
bedside
the
sun
was
blazing
full
across
the
bars
and
throwing
their
likeness
on
the
rough
floor
the
maid
who
had
brought
the
message
to
john
de
witt
s
house
entered
with
a
homely
meal
of
bread
cheese
and
dried
fish
why
are
you
crying
my
child
asked
john
gently
she
pressed
her
apron
to
her
eyes
oh
mynheer
she
said
in
terrified
sobbing
the
people
outside
they
grow
every
moment
more
what
do
they
want
asked
cornelius
calmly
to
kill
you
she
answered
in
a
burst
of
terror
oh
mynheer
the
ruard
s
dark
eyes
flashed
very
well
he
said
i
am
here
let
them
come
but
they
have
no
excuse
to
detain
my
they
will
not
let
mynheer
john
escape
the
girl
sobbed
shivering
some
of
them
are
searching
the
houses
next
door
to
see
if
there
should
be
any
secret
passage
and
there
has
one
climbed
on
to
the
roof
with
a
gun
if
you
try
to
we
have
no
thought
of
it
said
cornelius
proudly
the
maid
gave
him
a
wild
look
and
hurried
out
of
the
room
the
brothers
avoided
each
other
s
glance
john
surveyed
the
window
stoutly
barred
the
door
giving
on
to
the
narrow
corridor
certainly
they
were
in
a
he
set
the
meal
himself
on
the
smooth
polished
table
and
his
thoughts
were
in
his
home
on
the
kneuterdyk
he
pictured
johanna
s
piteous
preparations
for
their
return
her
anxious
arrangement
for
dinner
which
was
standing
now
untouched
in
the
her
setting
out
of
travelling
garments
for
cornelius
their
old
father
happy
again
at
the
thought
of
his
son
s
release
the
doves
in
the
trees
and
the
girls
in
their
pale
what
bitterness
were
they
enduring
as
the
time
went
on
and
the
threatening
crowd
spread
between
them
and
the
prison
these
little
trifling
recollections
were
the
keenest
stabs
in
the
wounded
heart
of
john
de
not
the
thought
of
his
useless
not
the
vision
of
approaching
death
were
as
potent
to
lacerate
his
soul
as
the
thought
of
those
waiting
in
vain
in
vain
cornelius
spoke
how
is
our
father
of
late
john
did
not
look
at
him
as
he
answered
well
but
failing
he
is
engaged
on
a
book
of
meditations
he
writes
them
down
in
the
i
should
have
liked
said
cornelius
to
see
him
he
was
under
no
delusions
as
to
his
own
fate
his
one
hope
was
to
save
his
brother
you
shall
see
him
answered
john
firmly
though
his
heart
swelled
with
choking
anguish
we
shall
get
out
of
this
why
these
people
are
our
countrymen
they
are
not
john
i
was
doomed
since
that
day
in
dordt
returned
cornelius
how
they
howl
i
wonder
why
they
hate
us
so
his
eyes
narrowed
as
he
listened
to
the
noise
rising
from
the
plaats
neither
spoke
until
they
had
finished
their
meal
each
eating
to
maintain
this
show
of
calm
before
the
other
at
the
end
john
rose
and
went
again
to
the
window
he
could
not
forbear
a
start
in
the
centre
of
the
plaats
a
section
of
the
burgher
company
of
the
red
was
putting
up
the
scaffold
always
erected
on
this
spot
for
an
execution
cornelius
could
not
but
perceive
his
agitation
what
are
they
doing
now
nothing
only
it
is
such
a
vast
he
was
absolutely
composed
again
though
he
could
not
doubt
for
whom
the
scaffold
was
intended
he
was
saved
from
further
question
by
the
entry
of
van
bossi
the
gaoler
was
almost
inarticulate
with
fear
and
dismay
they
gathered
from
his
broken
speech
that
two
of
the
burgher
captains
had
scaled
the
walls
of
the
and
in
company
with
ruysch
who
had
been
admitted
demanded
to
see
the
brothers
before
he
had
finished
speaking
noisy
voices
were
heard
in
the
corridor
and
the
three
men
pushed
rudely
into
the
chamber
they
were
armed
with
swords
and
muskets
and
wore
flaunting
orange
favours
the
gaoler
stepped
aside
and
the
intruders
found
themselves
face
to
face
with
john
de
witt
who
had
turned
full
towards
them
seeing
a
tall
gentleman
of
a
princely
carriage
erect
and
stately
as
any
soldier
with
a
pale
but
perfectly
composed
countenance
of
a
handsome
nobility
looking
at
them
with
the
eyes
that
had
faced
europe
their
mere
violence
was
abashed
what
is
your
authority
asked
john
de
witt
i
come
from
the
states
said
ruysch
sullenly
to
see
you
do
not
escape
before
we
hear
what
his
noble
and
mighty
highness
proposes
to
do
with
did
the
states
send
you
on
that
errand
demanded
cornelius
would
you
rather
be
left
to
the
citizens
of
the
hague
said
one
of
the
other
men
avoiding
his
eye
if
you
have
been
sent
to
protect
us
from
the
violence
of
the
mob
i
thank
you
said
john
but
we
are
neither
answerable
to
the
states
nor
to
his
highness
but
are
free
we
do
not
deny
it
replied
ruysch
who
wished
to
keep
on
the
side
of
the
law
very
john
took
up
his
hat
i
will
go
to
the
states
while
you
guard
my
brother
and
procure
an
order
for
his
his
calm
air
of
authority
overawed
them
but
they
stepped
before
the
door
by
what
right
do
you
detain
me
he
demanded
ruysch
who
had
no
pretext
could
only
say
wait
a
little
longer
sir
the
people
are
too
john
de
witt
looked
at
him
a
moment
in
silence
then
he
said
will
you
let
my
clerk
and
servant
depart
they
could
not
in
decency
refuse
ruysch
gave
ungracious
acquiescence
will
you
send
one
of
your
men
with
them
to
see
them
through
the
crowd
ruysch
hesitated
then
saw
a
chance
of
ridding
himself
of
an
onerous
duty
i
will
go
myself
he
said
john
de
witt
perceived
his
motive
but
did
not
quarrel
with
it
since
it
equally
well
served
his
turn
there
were
pen
and
ink
on
the
table
tearing
the
from
the
french
volume
he
wrote
on
it
an
urgent
message
to
van
ouvenaller
entreating
him
to
conduct
his
children
into
a
place
of
safety
he
handed
it
to
ruysch
give
this
to
my
clerk
who
is
below
he
said
and
with
an
earnest
look
of
nobility
that
brought
the
blood
to
ruysch
s
cheek
he
added
simply
i
know
very
well
what
is
ahead
of
me
and
i
ask
you
as
you
fear
god
to
see
my
children
i
will
do
it
answered
ruysch
awkwardly
he
left
meanly
glad
to
escape
the
task
of
protecting
the
brothers
i
wish
he
said
as
he
stepped
from
the
prison
that
i
had
never
seen
the
mm
de
john
now
turned
to
the
two
burgher
officers
with
a
disarming
courtesy
he
bid
them
sit
at
the
table
and
cornelius
offered
them
wine
you
are
brave
men
and
honourable
citizens
my
brother
is
innocent
you
will
defend
him
you
will
assure
the
people
he
is
the
statesman
who
had
guided
his
country
through
the
storms
of
european
politics
for
twenty
years
found
no
trouble
in
influencing
a
couple
of
ignorant
burghers
whom
he
employed
all
his
arts
to
gain
they
protested
their
goodwill
and
went
out
to
keep
guard
in
the
corridor
john
de
witt
s
hope
now
rested
in
count
tilly
who
with
the
utmost
firmness
was
sweeping
the
crowd
back
across
the
plaats
a
goldsmith
named
verhoef
in
company
with
michael
tichelaer
had
taken
the
head
of
one
of
the
burgher
companies
and
was
practically
master
of
the
moment
john
de
witt
could
hear
him
threateningly
order
tilly
to
retire
he
saw
tilly
ride
out
from
his
troops
to
answer
them
his
words
came
with
a
faint
clearness
to
the
prison
window
burghers
of
the
hague
do
you
wish
to
fill
your
streets
with
blood
if
you
do
possibly
you
may
be
the
first
to
suffer
for
wild
shouts
answered
him
withdraw
your
troops
no
i
obey
my
tilly
stands
firm
said
john
to
cornelius
verhoef
mounted
on
a
white
horse
rode
up
to
the
cavalry
of
the
states
an
orange
flag
in
his
hand
very
well
he
shouted
fiercely
if
it
is
orders
you
want
we
will
get
them
for
you
and
he
and
his
troop
galloped
off
in
the
direction
of
the
stadhuis
john
drew
back
from
the
window
they
have
gone
to
procure
an
order
for
tilly
s
withdrawal
he
said
in
a
low
voice
the
eyes
of
the
brothers
met
across
the
prison
space
the
magistrates
will
never
give
that
john
put
his
hand
to
his
breast
oh
pray
god
they
do
nothing
base
for
they
were
great
my
quickly
he
composed
himself
again
we
will
not
believe
it
no
man
could
be
so
weak
or
so
wicked
said
his
brother
as
to
deliver
us
to
certain
no
said
john
no
but
he
added
almost
instantly
i
would
the
prince
was
at
the
hague
the
prince
answered
his
brother
he
is
too
good
a
he
was
very
careful
not
to
be
at
the
hague
ah
no
the
ruard
smiled
in
an
angry
kind
of
scorn
they
have
sent
for
him
well
he
will
not
i
believe
he
will
let
him
only
get
the
message
in
time
ah
let
him
that
is
his
skill
to
cloak
himself
with
ifs
and
lets
you
never
liked
him
said
john
de
witt
but
i
can
not
believe
him
cornelius
dragged
himself
painfully
into
a
sitting
posture
hark
to
that
he
listened
to
the
manifold
and
surging
noises
of
the
crowd
without
held
only
at
bay
by
tilly
s
dragoons
some
devil
s
arts
have
struck
this
fury
out
of
it
is
michael
tichelaer
answered
john
staring
from
the
window
michael
tichelaer
a
boor
who
is
behind
michael
tichelaer
john
was
silent
i
will
answer
you
william
of
nassau
i
think
his
agents
are
there
now
below
urging
the
people
cornelius
i
do
not
credit
it
ah
do
not
let
us
fill
our
thoughts
with
such
he
moved
away
from
the
window
his
hand
to
his
brow
not
now
he
added
not
cornelius
looked
at
him
with
a
fierce
tenderness
he
had
never
from
the
first
alarm
thought
to
save
himself
but
he
had
not
anticipated
the
horror
of
involving
his
brother
in
his
fate
i
was
mad
to
send
for
you
he
said
bitterly
john
de
witt
did
not
speak
he
sat
droopingly
in
one
of
the
chairs
his
black
velvet
mantle
hanging
from
his
shoulders
his
long
hair
and
the
silk
ties
of
his
cravat
falling
over
his
breast
the
fine
lines
of
his
face
were
set
off
by
the
heavy
lace
round
his
throat
his
thick
brows
were
slightly
contracted
the
firm
full
lips
set
resolutely
under
the
slight
moustache
he
gazed
absently
at
the
rough
prison
floor
and
mean
walls
to
which
his
destiny
had
narrowed
endeavour
achievement
dignities
honour
labour
the
council
the
cabinet
high
hopes
noble
toil
all
come
to
this
paltry
square
of
boards
and
plaster
where
he
sat
forsaken
his
had
been
over
before
he
entered
the
humble
door
but
he
had
cherished
modest
desires
some
little
leisure
to
teach
his
son
and
love
his
daughters
some
peaceful
time
in
which
to
draw
nearer
the
god
he
had
always
served
in
the
heart
his
countrymen
had
broken
he
thought
of
all
the
things
he
had
wished
to
do
and
had
left
undone
of
his
home
and
the
farewells
that
morning
that
were
never
to
be
spoken
again
his
heart
seemed
to
contract
then
swell
stifling
him
he
turned
in
his
chair
with
a
quick
movement
of
agony
and
saw
his
brother
s
dark
resolute
eyes
gazing
at
him
cornelius
i
curse
myself
that
i
brought
you
here
said
the
ruard
even
if
i
had
foreseen
this
i
would
have
come
answered
john
we
are
at
least
together
he
smiled
since
we
have
shared
everything
for
so
long
it
is
good
that
we
share
this
he
went
swiftly
to
the
door
and
opened
it
on
the
two
burgher
officers
without
mynheeren
he
said
courteously
how
go
events
without
the
men
were
both
troubled
and
frightened
one
had
been
down
to
speak
to
tichelaer
who
had
just
returned
from
a
parley
with
the
magistrates
who
were
utterly
in
the
power
of
the
mob
tichelaer
and
verhoef
had
both
been
deaf
to
the
pleadings
of
the
councillors
and
had
declared
their
intention
of
dragging
the
brothers
from
the
prison
and
hanging
them
on
the
gibbet
refusing
even
to
wait
until
the
prince
reached
the
hague
his
mighty
noble
highness
is
too
tichelaer
had
declared
the
work
must
be
done
in
his
under
the
excuse
that
a
body
of
rebellious
peasants
were
marching
on
the
hague
the
burgher
companies
had
ordered
tilly
to
withdraw
and
defend
the
entry
to
the
town
but
on
his
firm
refusal
to
obey
any
but
his
masters
the
states
tichelaer
seeing
all
attempts
to
gain
the
prison
useless
while
he
kept
guard
had
gone
before
the
magistrates
a
second
time
to
extort
the
written
command
for
his
withdrawal
but
mynheer
said
the
burgher
officer
they
will
not
give
john
de
witt
gave
him
a
sweet
look
never
to
be
forgotten
you
are
a
good
fellow
he
said
and
have
done
your
best
for
us
it
must
be
as
god
sees
he
turned
into
the
room
again
cornelius
was
reading
in
the
little
horace
on
the
of
which
he
had
that
morning
written
his
name
and
the
date
in
commemoration
of
his
sentence
he
was
about
to
speak
but
such
a
furious
shouting
rose
from
the
plaats
that
he
was
silent
john
went
to
the
window
he
saw
tichelaer
the
foam
whitening
his
horse
ride
up
to
tilly
a
paper
in
his
hand
he
has
the
order
exclaimed
john
de
witt
and
even
as
he
spoke
the
command
was
given
the
dragoons
wheeled
round
and
galloped
away
across
the
plaats
the
triumphant
crowd
making
way
for
them
howling
yelling
have
they
gone
asked
cornelius
grimly
john
s
beautiful
hand
clutched
the
cold
bars
oh
this
is
a
bitter
way
to
die
he
murmured
he
turned
his
head
that
he
might
not
see
the
struggling
press
below
the
ferocious
distorted
faces
of
men
and
women
hastening
on
with
shining
arms
and
glittering
knives
burning
in
the
sunshine
why
were
not
the
bullets
merciful
at
southwold
bay
exclaimed
cornelius
i
would
rather
have
death
any
way
but
this
the
life
beaten
out
of
me
by
those
curs
he
made
a
passionate
gesture
with
his
bandaged
hand
towards
the
window
i
would
not
have
believed
they
would
have
done
it
no
have
given
that
order
not
said
john
faintly
he
stood
with
his
hand
on
his
breast
his
eyes
wide
the
refined
and
beautiful
body
shrank
from
the
thought
of
torture
and
humiliation
as
the
noble
soul
blenched
from
degradation
and
shame
he
was
afraid
of
the
manner
of
his
death
drew
back
from
it
with
loathing
as
he
would
from
a
sight
of
horror
a
volley
of
musketry
sounded
and
violent
blows
the
crowd
were
attacking
the
prison
door
john
put
his
hand
over
his
eyes
an
awful
sick
giddiness
overcame
him
cornelius
struggled
to
his
feet
and
caught
his
blue
mantle
round
him
is
there
no
way
out
muttered
john
he
moved
desperately
from
one
side
of
the
prison
to
the
other
and
beat
his
hand
against
the
cruel
iron
bars
trapped
forsaken
with
a
hideous
harsh
crash
of
iron
on
iron
the
door
below
gave
way
yells
and
the
crash
of
weapons
came
up
the
narrow
stairway
and
one
of
the
burgher
officers
rushed
in
crying
they
are
in
they
are
forcing
van
bossi
to
give
them
the
there
is
no
need
said
cornelius
calmly
the
door
is
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
his
bed
wrapped
in
his
blue
mantle
a
close
cap
on
his
head
from
under
which
his
brown
curls
escaped
on
to
his
shoulders
his
colourless
face
marred
with
suffering
was
composed
and
resolute
i
will
make
them
listen
to
reason
answered
the
soldier
and
went
out
into
the
corridor
this
is
the
end
said
cornelius
john
smiled
in
sudden
exaltation
he
took
up
his
brother
s
bible
and
seated
himself
in
the
chair
beside
the
bed
the
pages
fluttered
a
moment
under
his
white
fingers
then
he
began
to
read
howbeit
we
speak
wisdom
among
them
that
are
perfect
yet
not
the
wisdom
of
this
world
nor
of
the
princes
of
this
world
that
come
to
naught
cornelius
bowed
his
head
but
we
speak
the
wisdom
of
god
in
a
mystery
the
hidden
which
god
ordained
before
the
world
unto
our
glory
which
none
of
the
princes
of
this
world
knew
for
had
they
known
it
they
would
not
have
crucified
the
lord
of
glory
outside
their
sole
defenders
were
endeavouring
to
restrain
the
onslaught
of
tichelaer
the
corridor
was
choked
with
swords
and
muskets
john
de
witt
continued
in
an
uplifted
voice
but
as
it
is
written
eye
hath
not
seen
nor
ear
heard
neither
have
entered
into
the
heart
of
man
the
things
which
god
hath
prepared
for
them
that
love
the
groote
kerk
struck
four
with
angry
curses
at
the
delay
tichelaer
and
his
men
broke
across
the
threshold
john
de
witt
laid
down
the
bible
put
on
his
hat
and
turned
to
face
the
door
what
do
you
want
he
asked
and
gazed
at
them
with
narrowed
eyes
they
had
all
been
drinking
heavily
they
were
all
roused
to
the
height
and
very
extreme
of
brutish
passions
but
they
fell
back
smitten
where
they
stood
their
violence
turned
upon
themselves
at
the
sight
of
john
de
witt
like
a
creature
of
another
world
trapped
and
helpless
yet
abashing
its
hunters
who
feared
to
be
laid
low
by
some
disguised
and
hidden
god
he
stood
looking
at
them
composed
unarmed
what
do
you
want
he
repeated
tichelaer
lurched
forward
but
made
no
attempt
to
touch
him
we
want
this
villain
he
said
and
turned
to
cornelius
more
men
were
forcing
into
the
room
fiercely
accusing
of
bribery
the
two
who
strove
to
prevent
them
encouraged
by
sheer
numbers
tichelaer
strode
to
the
bed
come
get
up
he
said
roughly
to
the
ruard
pray
to
god
and
prepare
yourself
for
you
must
what
harm
have
i
done
you
asked
cornelius
calmly
verhoef
the
goldsmith
answered
you
have
attempted
the
life
of
his
very
noble
mightiness
the
prince
and
you
are
an
ugly
traitor
make
haste
and
get
john
stepped
towards
him
you
he
said
to
tichelaer
my
brother
is
under
the
terrible
fire
of
his
eyes
the
false
accuser
shrank
back
another
ruffian
a
miller
aimed
the
butt
end
of
his
musket
at
the
head
of
cornelius
john
catching
the
fellow
s
arm
turned
it
aside
it
hit
and
shattered
the
on
this
a
notary
named
van
saenen
struck
the
back
of
his
head
with
a
pike
de
witt
turned
and
looked
at
him
proudly
and
calmly
again
they
hesitated
not
one
of
them
offered
to
seize
him
he
removed
his
hat
pulled
out
his
handkerchief
and
bound
it
round
his
head
for
the
blood
was
dripping
down
his
curls
is
it
your
intention
to
kill
me
also
he
asked
a
murmur
came
from
those
at
the
back
yes
traitor
thief
and
rascal
you
shall
have
the
same
fate
as
your
cursed
brother
dress
yourself
shouted
verhoef
and
flung
the
ruard
s
clothes
on
the
bed
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
he
asked
them
where
do
you
want
me
to
go
he
was
as
calm
and
resigned
as
he
had
been
before
the
torture
he
tried
to
draw
on
his
violet
stocking
over
his
maimed
foot
but
was
so
threatened
with
a
dagger
at
his
throat
that
he
had
to
stumble
to
the
floor
undressed
as
he
was
what
do
you
want
with
me
he
repeated
haughtily
you
will
soon
find
out
they
shouted
back
and
tichelaer
turned
on
john
who
was
advancing
towards
his
brother
do
you
wish
my
life
asked
de
witt
very
well
then
take
but
verhoef
caught
tichelaer
back
these
traitors
must
die
on
the
gibbet
he
cried
spare
them
till
again
the
hideousness
of
his
death
presented
itself
overwhelmingly
to
de
witt
he
drew
back
against
the
plaster
walls
sick
at
heart
are
you
all
less
than
men
he
demanded
give
me
a
sword
he
made
a
futile
effort
to
snatch
one
from
the
crowd
ringing
him
round
traitor
shouted
tichelaer
do
dare
use
that
word
to
me
answered
john
de
witt
had
all
done
their
duty
as
i
did
not
a
town
had
been
lost
give
me
a
sword
he
added
some
weapon
tichelaer
gathered
courage
to
strike
him
with
the
end
of
his
musket
god
has
overtaken
you
he
yelled
john
de
witt
held
up
his
mantle
to
protect
himself
you
dare
to
take
the
name
of
god
he
answered
you
have
long
since
denied
him
by
your
as
he
spoke
he
saw
cornelius
raise
clasped
hands
to
heaven
as
he
was
thrust
violently
on
to
his
knees
let
me
get
to
my
brother
i
could

cried
verhoef
take
the
ruffians
to
the
gibbet
they
worked
themselves
up
again
into
the
fury
the
actual
presence
of
the
de
witts
had
cowed
tichelaer
and
his
followers
among
them
a
lusty
butcher
armed
with
an
axe
pushed
between
the
brothers
separating
them
by
the
width
of
the
room
some
one
struck
john
de
witt
on
the
face
cursing
him
the
insult
brought
the
blood
to
his
cheek
fellow
i
will
not
take
that
he
said
and
cast
the
man
down
it
was
the
signal
here
was
the
incentive
a
dozen
clutching
hands
laid
hold
on
john
de
witt
s
mantle
ah
do
you
lay
hands
on
me
he
cried
and
lifted
high
his
mantle
to
screen
his
face
verhoef
gave
him
a
push
that
made
him
stagger
and
fall
behold
the
downfall
of
the
perpetual
edict
shrieked
tichelaer
john
de
witt
got
to
his
feet
again
there
was
a
look
of
startled
horror
on
his
face
the
handkerchief
was
shaken
from
his
head
and
the
blood
ran
down
his
collar
they
were
quick
to
see
his
anguish
and
laughed
seizing
him
by
the
arms
and
dragging
him
towards
the
door
but
quickly
composure
came
again
he
spoke
with
a
coolness
that
confounded
them
i
have
never
betrayed
you
i
swear
to
god
i
have
always
done
my
duty
tichelaer
threatened
him
with
his
sword
but
did
not
dare
touch
him
because
of
the
great
brilliance
of
his
eyes
let
me
get
to
my
brother
why
do
not
you
strike
shouted
verhoef
our
friends
below
must
have
a
hand
in
this
they
are
getting
impatient
the
others
shouted
back
and
john
de
witt
at
the
point
of
a
dozen
swords
was
forced
down
the
close
stairs
having
lost
everything
else
he
was
still
resolute
to
save
his
honour
i
die
by
calumny
i
am
not
what
you
think
came
his
clear
cry
they
pushed
him
forward
he
drew
back
as
he
reached
the
first
landing
for
he
could
see
the
armed
and
hideous
crowd
below
filling
the
open
door
of
the
prison
waiting
for
him
he
could
see
the
upturned
faces
he
set
his
lips
and
his
nostrils
distended
as
he
heard
the
shrieks
of
furious
triumph
which
rose
as
they
saw
him
at
last
make
haste
they
cried
to
tichelaer
make
haste
verhoef
dragged
him
forward
at
that
moment
cornelius
bruised
and
maimed
scarcely
able
to
stand
was
struck
with
a
plank
and
flung
down
the
first
flight
of
stairs
john
turned
and
held
out
his
arms
across
the
swords
and
muskets
for
a
second
their
hands
were
just
able
to
touch
they
looked
into
each
other
s
eyes
and
even
smiled
as
they
were
torn
asunder
and
delivered
to
the
greedy
waiting
farewell

chapter
xiii
william
of
orange
a
coach
was
drawn
by
a
pair
of
fresh
brown
horses
at
a
gallop
through
the
quiet
village
of
ryswyck
an
hour
short
of
the
hague
the
sun
was
near
its
setting
and
the
peasants
leaving
their
work
turned
to
mark
with
surprise
the
haste
of
the
coach
as
it
swung
on
its
leathers
along
the
smooth
white
road
it
had
just
reached
the
little
church
with
the
lead
cupola
when
a
horseman
spurred
up
from
the
opposite
direction
halt
he
cried
he
spoke
with
such
an
air
of
authority
that
the
coachman
drew
rein
swerved
his
vehicle
and
stopped
do
you
ride
to
the
hague
asked
the
horseman
panting
ay
to
the
hague
the
man
stared
at
his
questioner
then
turn
back
turn
back
the
hague
is
no
place
for
honest
men
turn
back
his
voice
and
face
were
wild
his
appearance
dishevelled
the
mm
de
witt
have
been
murdered
he
said
hoarsely
two
hours
ago
my
god
my
god
they
were
to
hang
them
on
the
gibbet
they
dragged
them
out
of
the
prison
for
that
end
but
they
had
not
got
them
through
the
gate
before
they
tore
them
to
there
was
nought
left
to
tell
john
from
cornelius
save
the
difference
in
their
oh
my
lady
cried
the
coachman
and
sat
stunned
the
villagers
had
gathered
round
and
were
listening
in
a
bewildered
terror
the
horseman
dismounted
so
possessed
by
what
he
had
seen
that
he
must
babble
of
it
i
say
they
cut
their
hearts
they
are
hanging
head
downwards
on
the
gibbet
all
red
the
mm
de
witt
see
i
bought
this
for
two
they
cut
off
his
fingers
for
he
used
them
to
sign
the
perpetual
he
unfolded
his
cloak
from
something
he
carried
against
his
breast
and
held
it
out
oh
my
lady
moaned
the
coachman
and
let
the
reins
fall
the
coach
door
was
opened
a
lady
in
a
mantle
stepped
out
and
came
towards
the
increasing
and
horrified
group
what
have
you
got
there
she
asked
in
a
strange
voice
show
it
to
the
horseman
turned
to
her
frantically
i
saw
it
done
while
he
lived
too
look
he
held
out
a
beautiful
human
hand
torn
and
bloody
half
enwrapped
in
a
length
of
fine
lace
the
lady
drew
closer
i
know
that
hand
very
well
she
said
yesterday
it
was
on
the
body
of
my
a
shriek
ran
round
the
group
the
wretched
stranger
finding
himself
face
to
face
with
the
wife
of
cornelius
fell
on
his
knees
in
the
road
and
could
not
speak
maria
de
witt
was
quite
collected
in
that
instant
when
she
heard
through
the
coach
window
that
she
was
too
late
when
she
heard
what
had
happened
at
the
hague
heart
and
brain
had
broken
i
have
been
very
patient
she
said
for
it
was
god
s
will
but
i
must
hasten
now
for
i
wish
to
accompany
him
into
i
heard
at
dordt
this
morning
mynheer
that
he
was
she
turned
towards
the
coach
why
do
you
not
drive
on
she
asked
and
fell
against
the
dusty
wheel
there
was
no
one
with
her
save
the
two
they
dismounted
and
led
her
to
the
roadside
themselves
incapable
with
grief
where
is
his
hand
she
asked
my
lord
gave
me
his
hand
she
turned
sweet
expressionless
eyes
on
the
horseman
who
laid
the
bloodstained
relic
reverently
in
her
lap
she
sat
on
a
heap
of
stones
beneath
a
tall
poplar
tree
she
must
not
go
to
the
hague
he
cried
find
her
shelter
mynheer
john
s
children
gasped
the
coachman
his
clerk
took
them
to
safety
it
is
like
a
fair
at
the
hague
the
magistrates
all
dumb
with
dread
and
on
the
plaats
oh
i
am
sick
with
what
i
it
had
grown
dusk
the
villagers
crept
softly
round
the
figure
of
maria
de
witt
as
she
sat
meekly
clasping
the
hand
to
her
breast
he
is
hurt
hurt
she
said
in
accents
of
agony
the
rack
the
pulley
and
the
boot
but
i
have
balsam
in
the
carriage
ladies
there
will
be
an
engagement
at
sea
and
my
husband
will
save
us
they
appealed
to
the
pastor
to
take
her
in
but
he
was
too
cowardly
to
give
her
shelter
so
they
led
her
unresisting
to
the
humble
inn
one
servant
stayed
with
her
the
other
embarked
for
rotterdam
to
bring
to
her
her
maria
hoeuft
she
would
not
leave
the
parlour
which
she
had
first
entered
nor
take
food
nor
leave
the
fair
right
hand
that
she
carried
against
her
breast
as
tenderly
as
if
it
were
her
child
the
village
surgeon
would
not
visit
her
the
peasants
stood
aloof
fearful
of
befriending
one
so
unfortunate
for
awhile
they
thought
that
she
did
not
know
the
extent
of
her
misery
but
presently
she
called
for
a
quill
and
and
took
from
her
pocket
cornelius
little
diary
over
a
clean
page
she
had
written
the
date
meaning
to
add
beneath
it
her
husband
s
release
very
clearly
and
steadily
she
made
now
this
entry
it
ended
the
record
of
the
ruard
s
domestic
life
kept
very
carefully
by
him
until
his
imprisonment
this
day
august
my
beloved
husband
was
horribly
murdered
at
the
hague
by
the
burgher
faction
with
our
brother
john
de
witt
he
was
in
his
fiftieth
year
having
been
years
old
on
june
he
had
been
taken
on
the
last
day
of
july
to
the
court
of
justice
and
from
thence
on
august
to
prison
there
to
be
cruelly
tortured
on
the
sole
accusation
of
an
infamous
person
michael
tichelaer
barber
of
piershill
may
god
preserve
all
men
from
such
misfortunes
as
those
by
which
the
twentieth
of
this
month
has
been
so
sorrowfully
when
she
had
finished
she
looked
up
with
a
wild
air
is
it
right
she
asked
is
it
right
we
must
submit
to
god
all
my
happiness
then
she
rose
cornelius
you
must
snuff
the
candles
she
sank
on
to
the
chair
smiling
and
unconscious
they
lifted
her
on
to
the
settle
and
put
out
the
light
there
was
much
to
do
in
the
little
inn
and
she
was
the
widow
of
cornelius
de
witt
so
they
left
her
when
she
recovered
she
sat
up
in
the
dark
then
rose
to
her
feet
unsteadily
enough
torchlight
glimmered
through
the
window
for
her
to
see
the
door
she
pulled
it
open
and
stood
listening
in
the
opposite
room
across
the
narrow
corridor
men
were
talking
together
their
door
stood
ajar
and
a
thick
bar
of
yellow
fell
across
the
darkness
if
he
had
had
the
first
message
it
had
been
prevented
i
never
saw
him
so
moved
as
when
he
heard
the
this
delay
frets
him
he
cursed
the
groom
for
that
loose
shoe
yet
now
it
is
too
the
speakers
swung
out
into
the
corridor
soldiers
both
richly
dressed
they
took
no
notice
of
maria
and
her
useless
brain
attached
no
meaning
to
their
presence
or
their
words
they
strode
out
into
the
courtyard
the
whole
inn
was
full
of
noise
and
confusion
sudden
lights
and
runnings
to
and
fro
maria
stood
forgotten
not
heeding
or
caring
anything
then
she
heard
some
one
say
suddenly
the
prince
is
impatient
to
be
gone
the
prince
her
scattered
wits
caught
at
the
word
she
turned
back
into
the
chamber
now
bright
from
end
to
end
with
the
light
of
the
torches
in
the
courtyard
outside
she
took
up
the
stiff
white
hand
wrapped
in
the
stained
lace
the
prince
she
said
for
a
moment
her
clouded
brain
cleared
she
stepped
into
the
corridor
looking
about
her
drawn
erect
the
door
of
the
parlour
opposite
was
open
wide
now
and
she
could
see
by
the
light
of
a
tallow
candle
set
on
the
table
a
young
man
sitting
gloomily
his
cheek
propped
on
his
palm
and
his
face
hidden
by
his
chestnut
hair
maria
de
witt
stepped
into
the
small
sombre
chamber
you
are
the
prince
she
said
i
saw
you
once
in
a
on
the
ice
you
wore
a
mask
but
i
know
william
of
orange
looked
up
and
stared
across
the
smoky
yellow
light
seeing
a
lady
splendidly
dressed
her
black
hair
on
her
shoulders
a
face
horrified
and
fierce
and
desperate
eyes
keenly
regarding
him
he
gave
a
little
exclamation
as
he
rose
you
are
the
prince
she
repeated
his
violet
cloak
fell
apart
over
his
cuirass
and
his
lace
cravat
he
made
no
answer
as
he
moved
slightly
away
i
wonder
what
i
should
say
to
you
said
maria
de
witt
she
put
the
thing
she
held
at
her
breast
down
on
the
table
between
them
that
is
the
hand
of
your
enemy
are
you
proud
of
what
you
have
done
he
turned
his
head
away
with
a
sick
look
madame
who
are
you
i
am
his
she
looked
fixedly
at
the
prince
are
his
he
put
his
fingers
to
his
lips
and
stared
at
the
dead
hand
is
this
the
hand
of
john
de
witt
i
clasped
it
yesterday
it
is
my
husband
s
his
great
eyes
travelled
to
her
face
you
are
unsettled
in
your
mind
lady
have
you
no
better
shelter
than
this
she
struck
her
breast
vehemently
i
must
curse
you
are
you
content
at
last
you
hated
them
this
is
unendurable
i
madame
he
pushed
his
hair
back
from
his
low
brow
i
am
guiltless
of
this
no
she
said
softly
and
her
eyes
flickered
with
an
insane
light
hang
on
a
gibbet
on
the
plaats
what
shall
i
wish
you
you
who
let
it
be
she
pulled
at
her
long
lace
collar
staring
at
the
prince
the
two
soldiers
the
dim
room
and
gazed
at
the
figures
in
the
tawny
fluttering
light
bentinck
said
william
i
shall
be
greatly
shamed
for
maria
de
witt
did
not
lower
her
dark
eyes
from
his
face
if
you
should
ever
love
and
then
bear
what
i
now
bear
she
whispered
would
that
be
punishment
the
three
men
stood
motionless
if
you
should
die
childless
with
your
work
incomplete
would
you
be
punished
then
william
winced
and
caught
at
bentinck
s
sleeve
they
would
have
lived
for
me
her
proud
poise
relaxed
she
fell
into
the
chair
the
prince
had
risen
from
god
god
god
she
said
dully
we
must
submit
to
him
why
did
he
not
save
cornelius
zuylestein
peered
over
the
table
the
hand
of
the
grand
pensionary
he
shuddered
maria
de
witt
slipped
to
her
knees
they
tortured
him
she
cried
clasping
her
hands
and
my
balm
is
all
spent
william
of
orange
gave
her
a
wild
glance
there
are
many
hearts
like
to
break
before
this
task
of
mine
is
done
he
said
perhaps
my
own
amongst
them

away

work
will
not
wait
